1
00:00:01,283 --> 00:00:05,283
Got your Popcorn, Candy, Drinks ?
.... The Movie is Rolling ....

2
00:00:06,283 --> 00:00:09,683
"Enjoy the Movie"

3
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:13,879
(distant birds caw)

4
00:00:27,658 --> 00:00:29,460
(distant horse whinnies)

5
00:00:29,494 --> 00:00:31,163
(rapid hoofbeats approach)

6
00:00:32,464 --> 00:00:35,168
(grunting and panting)

7
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,172

00:01:00,858 --> 00:01:02,861
(panting)

12
00:01:04,696 --> 00:01:06,699
(pistol mechanism clicks)

13
00:01:07,965 --> 00:01:09,601
Ah.

14
00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:15,741
(gunfire)

15
00:01:17,608 --> 00:01:19,312
(gunshot)

16
00:01:29,488 --> 00:01:31,456
(cries out)

17
00:01:33,491 --> 00:01:35,627
(panting)

18
00:02:07,392 --> 00:02:09,795
(gunshot)

19
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:16,669
Come on.

20
00:02:20,772 --> 00:02:23,441
(man panting and groaning)

21
00:02:34,052 --> 00:02:36,422
(groaning and panting)

22
00:02:39,957 --> 00:02:41,026
Look at me.

23
00:02:43,094 --> 00:02:45,397
(man wheezes)

24
00:02:47,665 --> 00:02:48,867
Where'd he get to?

25
00:02:49,568 --> 00:02:52,570
(gasping)

26
00:02:57,776 --> 00:02:59,511
Where'd he get to?

27
00:02:59,544 --> 00:03:01,012
I don't know.

28
00:03:01,046 --> 00:03:03,949
(man screams)

29
00:03:07,084 --> 00:03:08,653
(man)
No!

30
00:03:18,863 --> 00:03:19,864
Get the rope.

31
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,505
We's... headin' east,
towards Indian Territory.

32
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,878
He's in a bad way.

33
00:03:33,577 --> 00:03:36,047
(gasping and groaning)

34
00:03:37,047 --> 00:03:39,051
Is that everything
you have to say on the matter?

35
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,619
I swear. I swear!

36
00:03:42,687 --> 00:03:43,822
You know what?

37
00:03:45,856 --> 00:03:47,558
I believe you.

38
00:03:47,592 --> 00:03:49,462
Whoa. Duggan.

39
00:03:50,995 --> 00:03:52,864
(panting)

40
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:55,667
Whoa.

41
00:03:56,767 --> 00:03:58,003
The hell?

42
00:04:03,175 --> 00:04:05,042
How the hell you figure
this wound up

43
00:04:05,076 --> 00:04:07,513
out here in the middle of
these grassland?

44
00:04:09,613 --> 00:04:11,050
This will work out nice.

45
00:04:17,888 --> 00:04:19,657
Just cut me loose.

46
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,726
You'll never see me again,
honest. Just cut me loose.

47
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,661
Sit on up.

48
00:04:23,695 --> 00:04:25,863
Well, you see,
I would cut you loose,

49
00:04:25,897 --> 00:04:28,567
but that just violates
my sense of what's right.

50
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:29,434
(sharp gasp)

51
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,912

HENRY: It can be hard to tell
who and what a man is,

55
00:05:17,048 --> 00:05:19,652
he's got a mind
to convince you otherwise.

56
00:05:21,585 --> 00:05:25,157
My people were from New York,
where I was born.

57
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,092
By the time I was three,

58
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:31,229
we'd made it to
Coffeyville, Kansas,

59
00:05:31,262 --> 00:05:36,234
then down to Arizona,
then New Mexico.

60
00:05:36,267 --> 00:05:39,003
I was in Mexico
proper for a time.

61
00:05:41,106 --> 00:05:43,742
I've tried my hand at
many a vocation.

62
00:05:46,611 --> 00:05:48,880
Some more marginal
than others.

63
00:05:57,121 --> 00:06:01,259
Finally, I settled on the life
of a farmer.

64
00:06:02,627 --> 00:06:04,063
Which is what I am.

65
00:06:51,008 --> 00:06:53,844
We got that hog, stock to feed,

66
00:06:53,878 --> 00:06:55,947
and a root cellar to fill.

67
00:06:55,981 --> 00:06:58,683
There's tractors can do this now
in quarter the time.

68
00:06:58,717 --> 00:07:00,685
Is that right?

69
00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:01,786
And here I thought

70
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,889
farming was in
your bones, Wyatt.

71
00:07:06,056 --> 00:07:07,693
This would be a
good place for you

72
00:07:07,726 --> 00:07:09,194
to raise a family of your own.

73
00:07:09,226 --> 00:07:11,863
I know your ma would have
felt that way.

74
00:07:11,895 --> 00:07:13,064
I ain't her.

75
00:07:15,233 --> 00:07:16,635
Or him.

76
00:07:16,668 --> 00:07:19,338
By wisdom is a house built,

77
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,839
and through understanding
is it established.

78
00:07:22,707 --> 00:07:24,810
Through knowledge are
its rooms filled

79
00:07:24,842 --> 00:07:27,044
with rare and
beautiful treasures.

80
00:07:27,077 --> 00:07:30,315
And blessed are those hearts
that are set on pilgrimage.

81
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,286
Much as I'd like to
stick around...

82
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,856
listen to y'all quote Scripture
at each other...

83
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,858
I'm goin' bird huntin'.

84
00:07:41,825 --> 00:07:43,729
Thanks for the help, Al.

85
00:07:44,395 --> 00:07:46,164
It does me good to be here.

86
00:07:47,731 --> 00:07:51,604
Makes me feel like I'm still
connected to Marie somehow.

87
00:07:52,837 --> 00:07:54,839
Give your uncle a hand
with his things.

88
00:07:54,873 --> 00:07:57,909
That is, if you've had
sufficient respite.

89
00:08:17,161 --> 00:08:19,096
Thank you, son.

90
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,065
Yes, sir.

91
00:08:20,097 --> 00:08:21,932
Yeah, I wanted to go huntin'
this mornin',

92
00:08:21,966 --> 00:08:24,136
but your pa said he
needed some help.

93
00:08:25,135 --> 00:08:27,205
Sure would like to go with you
one of these days.

94
00:08:27,238 --> 00:08:29,908
I don't think
that'd go over too well.

95
00:08:31,775 --> 00:08:33,378
Your pa's a good man, Wyatt.

96
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:35,681
I wouldn't let him
marry my sister

97
00:08:35,714 --> 00:08:37,016
if I didn't think so.

98
00:08:39,383 --> 00:08:41,419
Soon enough, you'll be able to

99
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:44,323
do all the travelin'
and shootin' you want to.

100
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,325
Stop frettin' about it.

101
00:09:05,008 --> 00:09:08,080
We'll take two chops
for supper and smoke the rest.

102
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:13,084
I ain't got time to render this.
Throw it in the pen.

103
00:09:32,369 --> 00:09:34,472
Don't it bother you sometimes,
they eat their own?

104
00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:37,976
Don't make no
difference to a hog.

105
00:09:52,857 --> 00:09:54,493
WYATT:
Why'd you settle here?

106
00:09:54,526 --> 00:09:56,128
HENRY:
What's that meant to mean?

107
00:09:57,394 --> 00:10:01,733
Why? Why the Territory,
of all places?

108
00:10:03,334 --> 00:10:04,803
You could stake a claim,

109
00:10:04,835 --> 00:10:07,004
hang onto it for a year,
it was yours.

110
00:10:07,806 --> 00:10:09,974
Seemed like
a pretty good deal at the time.

111
00:10:12,343 --> 00:10:15,280
Got here before the guns
went off, you know that.

112
00:10:16,013 --> 00:10:18,015
I still don't believe
this is what you wanted.

113
00:10:19,551 --> 00:10:23,522
Up at dawn, feedin' the stock,
workin' the crops.

114
00:10:24,522 --> 00:10:26,258
Hot or cold, rain or shine.

115
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:29,128
You'll discover
there's worse arrangements.

116
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,433
(horse whinnies)

117
00:10:38,102 --> 00:10:39,438
Pa?

118
00:11:20,578 --> 00:11:22,247
Easy, gal, that's it.

119
00:11:24,482 --> 00:11:26,852
Had me a mare near
just like this

120
00:11:26,884 --> 00:11:28,352
when I wasn't much
older than you.

121
00:11:29,219 --> 00:11:30,354
Lookie here.

122
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:36,962
What do you think happened?
Some kind of robbery?

123
00:11:36,994 --> 00:11:39,096
- A shootout?
- Shut your nonsense.

124
00:11:40,431 --> 00:11:43,001
I'd best go look for the rider.

125
00:11:43,033 --> 00:11:44,969
Yeah, I'll go saddle up.

126
00:11:45,003 --> 00:11:48,105
You tend to this horse
and stay inside till I get back.

127
00:11:48,973 --> 00:11:51,075
But what if it's trouble, Pa?
I can help you.

128
00:11:51,108 --> 00:11:52,911
Go on. Do as I say.

129
00:14:01,638 --> 00:14:02,640
Hello.

130
00:15:41,171 --> 00:15:42,574
(soft thud)

131
00:15:55,685 --> 00:15:56,687
Nope.

132
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:40,798
(pistol mechanism clicks)

133
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:17,168
Wyatt!

134
00:17:19,303 --> 00:17:21,238
- Is he alive?
- Barely.

135
00:17:21,271 --> 00:17:22,306
Was he alone?

136
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:28,313
No, but I dispatched
with a dozen others was there.

137
00:17:28,345 --> 00:17:29,113
Give me a hand.

138
00:17:30,314 --> 00:17:31,950
He's... he's lost a
lot of blood.

139
00:17:40,524 --> 00:17:42,327
Is he gonna live?

140
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,229
Be up to us, I suppose.

141
00:17:44,261 --> 00:17:46,330
Too far and too late
to fetch the doc.

142
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:50,567
Well, I can go.
Ride all night if I have to.

143
00:17:50,601 --> 00:17:52,270
I'm sure you would.

144
00:17:53,871 --> 00:17:55,540
So?

145
00:17:55,573 --> 00:17:57,842
You'll stay right here.
Hand over that witch hazel.

146
00:18:05,415 --> 00:18:07,317
That is an outlaw.

147
00:18:07,351 --> 00:18:09,487
On the run, shot off his horse.

148
00:18:10,488 --> 00:18:11,689
You think he killed somebody?

149
00:18:11,721 --> 00:18:14,425
Wyatt, I know
just as much as you do.

150
00:18:15,425 --> 00:18:16,927
What's that for?

151
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,931
Seal the wound tight
so he don't bleed out overnight.

152
00:18:21,364 --> 00:18:24,902
No! Don't never elevate
the feet with a chest wound.

153
00:18:34,312 --> 00:18:36,014
I've seen the scars
on your body.

154
00:18:36,046 --> 00:18:37,915
'Cause I ain't hid 'em from you.

155
00:18:38,915 --> 00:18:41,652
Now maybe you'll
understand your raisin'.

156
00:18:41,686 --> 00:18:43,021
Put your hand right here.

157
00:18:48,859 --> 00:18:49,794
Where you goin'?

158
00:18:49,826 --> 00:18:52,263
Just keep applyin' pressure
till I get back.

159
00:18:53,396 --> 00:18:54,665
(Wyatt sighs)

160
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,703
(insects chirping)

161
00:19:36,574 --> 00:19:40,644
(distant loon calls)

162
00:20:03,633 --> 00:20:05,870
(clattering)

163
00:20:21,552 --> 00:20:23,755
(clattering)

164
00:20:31,495 --> 00:20:34,766
(clattering)

165
00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:56,453
(clattering)

166
00:21:26,816 --> 00:21:29,086
(water sloshes)

167
00:21:40,931 --> 00:21:42,032
What now?

168
00:21:42,065 --> 00:21:45,502
Bullet's gotta come out.
And he won't make the ride.

169
00:21:46,937 --> 00:21:48,206
Half that rope.

170
00:22:00,985 --> 00:22:02,554
I'll fetch the doc.

171
00:22:03,888 --> 00:22:05,957
You'll stay here
and keep an eye on him.

172
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:15,166
You really think
that's necessary?

173
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:17,101
It ain't not necessary.

174
00:22:18,134 --> 00:22:20,136
Now, why don't you
cool his fever

175
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,706
instead of vaporizin' on every

176
00:22:21,738 --> 00:22:23,540
thought that comes
into your head?

177
00:22:53,871 --> 00:22:55,038
Trail's cold.

178
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:00,612
We'll get him.

179
00:23:22,298 --> 00:23:23,300
(shrill whistle)

180
00:23:29,873 --> 00:23:32,209
That dog could track
a fish through water.

181
00:23:32,241 --> 00:23:34,778
(both chuckle)

182
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:36,681
Come on.

183
00:23:47,091 --> 00:23:49,193
HENRY: He should come to,
you keep your distance.

184
00:23:49,226 --> 00:23:50,895
It don't matter he's tied up.

185
00:23:50,928 --> 00:23:52,630
WYATT:
I can handle myself

186
00:23:52,662 --> 00:23:55,165
HENRY: You just do as I say.
I'll be back soon as I can.

187
00:23:55,199 --> 00:23:56,200
Come on.

188
00:24:46,883 --> 00:24:47,884
(sudden gasp)

189
00:25:31,061 --> 00:25:32,296
(soft gasp)

190
00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:40,805
(pistol mechanism clicks)

191
00:26:10,834 --> 00:26:12,003
(exhales)

192
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:16,005
(gunshot)

193
00:26:16,038 --> 00:26:17,107
(soft chuckle)

194
00:26:23,814 --> 00:26:25,816
(gunshot)

195
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,492
(gunshot)

196
00:26:35,526 --> 00:26:38,729
(soft chuckle)

197
00:26:45,067 --> 00:26:46,170
(gunshot)

198
00:26:46,202 --> 00:26:48,372
(Curry grunts)

199
00:26:48,404 --> 00:26:50,941
(soft groan)

200
00:26:52,008 --> 00:26:53,411
(Curry grunts)

201
00:26:58,248 --> 00:26:59,417
Where's Billy at?

202
00:27:04,188 --> 00:27:06,023
(in Spanish)

203
00:27:07,391 --> 00:27:10,227
(gunshot)

204
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:13,263
(man) Keep your head down.
You'll be all right.

205
00:27:45,461 --> 00:27:46,931
(soft gasp)

206
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:07,450
(Curry grunts)

207
00:28:15,057 --> 00:28:16,827
(distant thunder rumbles)

208
00:28:25,334 --> 00:28:26,336
Whoa.

209
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,242
He was here.

210
00:29:42,045 --> 00:29:43,647
Don't look like it to me.

211
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:47,919
(distant thunder rumbles)

212
00:29:52,588 --> 00:29:55,325
If I'm right, he weren't alone.

213
00:30:00,063 --> 00:30:01,599
Whoever it is knows
what he's doin'.

214
00:30:05,434 --> 00:30:08,204
Covered his tracks as good
as anyone I've run across.

215
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:11,342
Weren't for this rain,
I'd have found him sooner.

216
00:30:12,209 --> 00:30:14,979
KETCHUM: I don't need you
to speechify the inner workings

217
00:30:15,011 --> 00:30:17,080
in your halfwit canine mind.

218
00:30:18,315 --> 00:30:19,950
I need to know where
he's headed.

219
00:30:25,087 --> 00:30:27,290
Well, that don't exactly
narrow it down.

220
00:30:27,324 --> 00:30:29,192
(distant bird squawks,
wings flutter)

221
00:31:33,155 --> 00:31:34,457
(gunshot)

222
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,069
(Curry, groggy)
Where am I?

223
00:32:19,302 --> 00:32:20,471
(groans)

224
00:32:21,337 --> 00:32:22,839
(groans)

225
00:32:24,406 --> 00:32:25,475
Who the hell are you?

226
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:29,246
M-My pa found you,
close to dead.

227
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:30,747
He brought you back here.

228
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:32,415
Oh, yeah?

229
00:32:32,449 --> 00:32:34,183
Who's your pa?

230
00:32:34,217 --> 00:32:35,219
Nobody. Uh...

231
00:32:35,652 --> 00:32:37,321
Henry. Just a-a farmer.

232
00:32:38,889 --> 00:32:40,190
(pained grunts)

233
00:32:42,892 --> 00:32:44,161
(grunt)

234
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,268
What, it's only you
and him here?

235
00:32:54,904 --> 00:32:56,239
He here now?

236
00:32:59,642 --> 00:33:00,777
He's just out back.

237
00:33:03,446 --> 00:33:05,116
Tendin' to the hogs.

238
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,251
Oh, yeah?

239
00:33:12,454 --> 00:33:13,623
Well, go fetch him.

240
00:33:27,938 --> 00:33:29,672
Quit mov... moving!

241
00:33:31,274 --> 00:33:32,642
Right now, I don't
want to hurt you.

242
00:33:32,675 --> 00:33:34,343
I don't want to hurt you.
Stop moving!

243
00:33:34,376 --> 00:33:37,280
Where'd you put my gun
and my satchel? Listen to me!

244
00:33:37,314 --> 00:33:38,782
I don't know what
you're talkin' about, mister.

245
00:33:38,815 --> 00:33:39,749
Don't you lie to me!

246
00:33:39,783 --> 00:33:42,152
What'd you do
with my gun and my satchel?

247
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:51,794
(cries out)

248
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:11,348
Pa!

249
00:34:15,317 --> 00:34:17,486
How'd he get loose?

250
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,722
H-He wriggled free.

251
00:34:19,422 --> 00:34:20,857
Wriggled free?

252
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:23,861
And got hold of my knife
I left on the bedstand.

253
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,830
Well, that's on the both of us.

254
00:34:27,864 --> 00:34:30,467
Help me tie the son of a
bitch back up.

255
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,681
(sharp gasps)

256
00:34:45,714 --> 00:34:47,417
(Curry grunts)

257
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:50,955
(panting)

258
00:34:55,058 --> 00:34:58,229
(audibly straining)

259
00:34:59,895 --> 00:35:00,897
Okay.

260
00:35:02,899 --> 00:35:05,768
You better think long and hard
on what you got yourself into.

261
00:35:05,801 --> 00:35:08,638
Funny, I was about
to tell you the same thing.

262
00:35:11,373 --> 00:35:12,910
What you aimin' to do with that?

263
00:35:13,776 --> 00:35:16,646
Gonna dig that
bullet out of you,

264
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,748
maybe get some answers
in the process.

265
00:35:19,448 --> 00:35:21,017
I like what I hear,

266
00:35:21,051 --> 00:35:24,355
I might be inclined to give you
something to ease the pain.

267
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:29,959
(Curry grunts)

268
00:35:29,993 --> 00:35:32,895
No.
(grunts)

269
00:35:33,897 --> 00:35:34,931
No!

270
00:35:35,931 --> 00:35:37,767
Okay! Listen, listen!

271
00:35:37,801 --> 00:35:39,436
No!

272
00:35:39,468 --> 00:35:41,604
Let's start with you
tellin' me who you are.

273
00:35:41,638 --> 00:35:44,440
(shrieks) I'm law!
I'm a goddamn lawman!

274
00:35:44,473 --> 00:35:45,508
(Curry cries out)

275
00:35:45,542 --> 00:35:48,478
He ain't no lawman, Pa,
he was fixin' to kill me.

276
00:35:48,511 --> 00:35:49,946
Ready for some whisky?

277
00:35:49,979 --> 00:35:52,549
I just told you... I'm law.

278
00:35:52,582 --> 00:35:54,285
(Curry shrieks)

279
00:35:54,783 --> 00:35:56,352
Ask him about the money.

280
00:35:57,553 --> 00:35:58,855
What money?

281
00:35:59,589 --> 00:36:00,824
He asked me about it.

282
00:36:01,924 --> 00:36:03,759
Listen. Listen to me.

283
00:36:03,792 --> 00:36:04,794
Okay, listen.

284
00:36:05,962 --> 00:36:07,898
What's a shot lawman doin'
with a satchel full of cash?

285
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:09,665
Listen!
(pained groan)

286
00:36:09,698 --> 00:36:11,667
Listen! If you got a
brain in your head,

287
00:36:11,701 --> 00:36:13,536
you need to get
yourself and your boy

288
00:36:13,569 --> 00:36:15,004
out of here fast as you can.

289
00:36:15,038 --> 00:36:16,473
You hear me?

290
00:36:21,578 --> 00:36:22,612
No.

291
00:36:22,645 --> 00:36:24,748
Oh, no! No, no!

292
00:36:24,781 --> 00:36:26,950
(Curry screams)

293
00:36:30,687 --> 00:36:34,056
(screaming continues)

294
00:36:34,089 --> 00:36:37,593
(screaming subsides)

295
00:36:40,663 --> 00:36:42,099
At least we know you won't die

296
00:36:42,131 --> 00:36:44,434
'fore I find out what I
want to know.

297
00:36:51,808 --> 00:36:52,943
Oh God.

298
00:36:56,479 --> 00:36:57,814
Let me have a little more.

299
00:36:57,846 --> 00:36:59,915
Let me...
(panting)

300
00:36:59,948 --> 00:37:01,551
(distant horse whinnies)

301
00:37:03,553 --> 00:37:04,555
Riders.

302
00:37:09,526 --> 00:37:12,562
Come on, cut me loose.
Come on, cut me loose.

303
00:37:13,562 --> 00:37:14,730
(pained cry)

304
00:37:14,763 --> 00:37:17,500
Listen, they gon' be
three of 'em.

305
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,404
One's a Mexican.

306
00:37:21,437 --> 00:37:23,873
The other's an ugly
son of a bitch

307
00:37:23,906 --> 00:37:25,609
with a thick beard.

308
00:37:25,642 --> 00:37:26,777
And their leader...

309
00:37:28,011 --> 00:37:29,747
their leader looks like a man
you don't want to mess with.

310
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,448
And believe me, you don't.

311
00:37:32,482 --> 00:37:34,017
Keep back from the window.

312
00:37:35,518 --> 00:37:37,154
If you want to live,
you gotta turn me loose

313
00:37:37,187 --> 00:37:38,455
and give me my gun, hear?

314
00:37:39,721 --> 00:37:40,756
He's lyin'.

315
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:42,793
I said keep back.

316
00:37:42,826 --> 00:37:43,894
Go on.

317
00:38:07,082 --> 00:38:09,552
(shell casings clatter)

318
00:38:38,781 --> 00:38:40,083
Can I help you?

319
00:38:40,716 --> 00:38:42,251
I'm Sheriff Sam Ketchum.

320
00:38:42,285 --> 00:38:43,987
These here are my deputies.

321
00:38:44,888 --> 00:38:46,890
We've been scoutin'
for a man on the run.

322
00:38:46,922 --> 00:38:49,459
Lately goes by the
name of Curry.

323
00:38:50,526 --> 00:38:51,828
Been shot.

324
00:38:52,694 --> 00:38:56,499
Six foot, brown hair,
said to be handsome,

325
00:38:56,533 --> 00:38:58,034
though most would
want him credited

326
00:38:58,067 --> 00:38:59,136
for nothing but devilry.

327
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:04,707
What I do know is,
he's dangerous.

328
00:39:05,207 --> 00:39:07,743
You seen anybody around here
answers that description?

329
00:39:08,611 --> 00:39:12,114
Say you're a sheriff?
How's it I don't recognize you?

330
00:39:12,714 --> 00:39:14,718
We're from way over
in Woods County.

331
00:39:15,817 --> 00:39:17,120
Now, this Curry we're
looking for,

332
00:39:17,152 --> 00:39:18,622
he's got a warrant on him there

333
00:39:18,654 --> 00:39:20,823
in Missouri and Tennessee.

334
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:24,026
Might also claim he's the law.

335
00:39:24,727 --> 00:39:26,763
He's got a history of
such chicanery.

336
00:39:27,629 --> 00:39:30,834
Far from it. He's a killer.

337
00:39:30,866 --> 00:39:32,602
He will kill again.

338
00:39:35,138 --> 00:39:36,239
You're not fixin' to shoot

339
00:39:36,272 --> 00:39:38,040
any of us with that pistol,
are you?

340
00:39:39,709 --> 00:39:41,777
So far I got no reason to.

341
00:39:43,111 --> 00:39:44,113
KETCHUM:
That's good news.

342
00:39:47,283 --> 00:39:52,221
You'll want to think 'fore you
raise that thing up, farmer.

343
00:39:52,254 --> 00:39:54,657
Nothing to be
worried about here, friend.

344
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:57,194
Just a little project
I'm working on, that's all.

345
00:39:59,596 --> 00:40:01,164
How many people live out here?

346
00:40:02,931 --> 00:40:04,334
What difference is that to you?

347
00:40:04,366 --> 00:40:07,336
I'm trying to make sure
you're safe, is all.

348
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:09,105
Wouldn't seem to be
your business,

349
00:40:09,138 --> 00:40:11,741
seeing as how you're
from Woods County.

350
00:40:12,908 --> 00:40:14,910
You married?

351
00:40:14,944 --> 00:40:16,647
Saw a grave over there.

352
00:40:19,047 --> 00:40:20,049
My wife.

353
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:23,953
Died ten years back
from tuberculosis.

354
00:40:26,089 --> 00:40:27,157
My condolences.

355
00:40:29,658 --> 00:40:31,193
Horrible way to go.

356
00:40:31,227 --> 00:40:33,696
(whispering)
Tell 'em, Pa. Tell 'em!

357
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:36,233
Marie Hobbs McCarty,
the marker said.

358
00:40:36,966 --> 00:40:39,035
Your last name McCarty?

359
00:40:39,067 --> 00:40:40,102
That's right.

360
00:40:41,203 --> 00:40:42,573
First name?

361
00:40:46,341 --> 00:40:47,610
Henry.

362
00:40:49,979 --> 00:40:51,915
So Hobbs was her people,
I'm guessing.

363
00:40:52,681 --> 00:40:55,285
'Cause I noticed a Hobbs ranch
to the east of here.

364
00:40:55,317 --> 00:40:56,586
HENRY:
Her brothers.

365
00:40:57,687 --> 00:40:58,721
Uh-huh.

366
00:41:00,989 --> 00:41:02,225
Well, from the looks of things,

367
00:41:02,258 --> 00:41:03,993
you've been out here a
good many years.

368
00:41:06,229 --> 00:41:07,598
Nice situation.

369
00:41:08,397 --> 00:41:10,733
All nestled up here
in the hills.

370
00:41:10,767 --> 00:41:12,201
Hard to see from a distance.

371
00:41:13,402 --> 00:41:16,640
What's any of this got to do
with the man you're lookin' for?

372
00:41:17,739 --> 00:41:19,142
Not much, I'll grant you.

373
00:41:22,678 --> 00:41:24,381
Long time ago, uh...

374
00:41:24,413 --> 00:41:29,018
was a fella caused some trouble
down Arizona, New Mexico way.

375
00:41:30,018 --> 00:41:31,821
Heard he went by the
name McCarty.

376
00:41:33,922 --> 00:41:35,825
I was wondering if he
might be your kin.

377
00:41:36,893 --> 00:41:39,296
You got the wrong
pig by the ear.

378
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,997
Meaning?

379
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:44,801
I don't know no McCartys
anywhere but here,

380
00:41:44,834 --> 00:41:46,902
and all my kin is deceased.

381
00:41:48,738 --> 00:41:50,739
Now I got chores to tend to

382
00:41:50,772 --> 00:41:53,375
and scant wood to
cook my supper.

383
00:41:53,408 --> 00:41:56,011
I ain't seen the man
you're after.

384
00:41:56,044 --> 00:41:58,014
I'll keep my eyes peeled.

385
00:41:58,848 --> 00:42:00,683
Be sure to alert the
good Sheriff

386
00:42:00,716 --> 00:42:02,919
in Chickasha if I should
run across him.

387
00:42:06,288 --> 00:42:07,290
Well, then.

388
00:42:08,725 --> 00:42:09,926
I thank you for your help.

389
00:42:12,428 --> 00:42:14,397
Looks like another dead end,
boys.

390
00:42:16,933 --> 00:42:18,935
You be sure to lock your
doors tonight.

391
00:42:21,803 --> 00:42:22,939
Stay safe.

392
00:42:26,808 --> 00:42:27,910
Come on.

393
00:42:50,065 --> 00:42:51,834
Now you're inclined to
hang onto that?

394
00:42:51,868 --> 00:42:53,103
I thought you might be needin'
help.

395
00:42:53,136 --> 00:42:54,904
You wanna tell me how
this got fired?

396
00:42:55,837 --> 00:42:57,140
Honest, Pa.

397
00:42:57,172 --> 00:42:58,308
Don't you lie to me!

398
00:42:59,509 --> 00:43:02,212
I wanted to know what it's like.

399
00:43:02,245 --> 00:43:07,016
I am the only boy for 50 miles
that's never fired one.

400
00:43:07,049 --> 00:43:09,384
You won't even let me
lay hand on your old shotgun.

401
00:43:09,417 --> 00:43:13,088
So if you can't teach me proper,
I gotta do it myself.

402
00:43:13,122 --> 00:43:17,460
You get into my things again,
I will crack your crust!

403
00:43:17,493 --> 00:43:19,161
(soft sobs)

404
00:43:19,194 --> 00:43:22,231
You're a stupid,
worthless old man.

405
00:43:22,864 --> 00:43:25,200
A whole life, and nothin'
to show for it

406
00:43:25,234 --> 00:43:26,870
but this rundown old farm

407
00:43:26,902 --> 00:43:28,937
and a boy who's gonna
leave you alone to die

408
00:43:28,971 --> 00:43:30,841
as soon as he's able.

409
00:43:43,419 --> 00:43:44,754
Let me guess.

410
00:43:45,221 --> 00:43:46,890
You gon' tell me that he ain't

411
00:43:46,922 --> 00:43:49,058
the sheriff of Woods County,
you are.

412
00:43:49,091 --> 00:43:51,527
They ain't lawmen,
they're bank robbers.

413
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,763
Well, what's left of them,
anyway.

414
00:43:55,897 --> 00:43:59,067
Knocked over the Adams Express.

415
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,136
Me and my deputies gave chase,
killed two of 'em,

416
00:44:01,169 --> 00:44:02,538
including the one
carrying the loot.

417
00:44:02,571 --> 00:44:04,506
Bank robbers wearin' badges?

418
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:06,176
That they took off
me and my men.

419
00:44:07,176 --> 00:44:08,911
He's the one
impersonating the law.

420
00:44:10,613 --> 00:44:12,315
But you made off with the money.

421
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:15,452
Hell, yeah, I grabbed it.

422
00:44:17,185 --> 00:44:19,989
Then why ain't you back with it
in Woods County?

423
00:44:20,455 --> 00:44:24,059
Oh, I don't know.
Why does it look like?

424
00:44:27,196 --> 00:44:28,264
And my first priority was

425
00:44:28,297 --> 00:44:30,033
getting away from
that bunch alive.

426
00:44:30,065 --> 00:44:32,067
That's why I rode like hell
till I couldn't no more.

427
00:44:32,602 --> 00:44:34,136
There's the last thing
I remembered,

428
00:44:34,169 --> 00:44:35,471
till I woke up here.

429
00:44:37,439 --> 00:44:38,540
Look, I know what I'm saying

430
00:44:38,573 --> 00:44:40,108
sounds ridiculous to
you and all.

431
00:44:40,142 --> 00:44:41,344
That it does.

432
00:44:41,377 --> 00:44:42,879
Why they didn't shoot you dead

433
00:44:42,911 --> 00:44:44,480
on the spot just now,
I don't know.

434
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,183
But I can guarantee you...

435
00:44:48,317 --> 00:44:49,886
they'll be back.

436
00:45:44,272 --> 00:45:46,174
Only thing I can't figure

437
00:45:46,207 --> 00:45:47,242
is why the old man

438
00:45:47,276 --> 00:45:49,446
would risk his neck
for a stranger.

439
00:45:50,145 --> 00:45:52,214
Maybe he got offered a
cut of the money.

440
00:45:53,616 --> 00:45:55,285
Something tells me
that ain't it.

441
00:45:57,553 --> 00:45:59,422
Any one of us could have
taken him out.

442
00:46:00,388 --> 00:46:02,224
Which is what we should do now.

443
00:46:02,258 --> 00:46:06,096
- Ride up, finish it.
- Not just yet.

444
00:46:09,431 --> 00:46:11,634
'Cause of some shaky old farmer?

445
00:46:11,667 --> 00:46:15,404
He didn't hold that pistol
like any farmer I've ever seen.

446
00:46:16,404 --> 00:46:18,173
There are three of us.

447
00:46:19,207 --> 00:46:22,377
We don't run up in a bank,
or ride up on a stage

448
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:23,913
- without knowing who's in it.
- (Duggan spits)

449
00:46:24,413 --> 00:46:27,383
We know Curry's in there.
With our money!

450
00:46:27,415 --> 00:46:29,084
Which is why you're
going to reconnoiter

451
00:46:29,118 --> 00:46:31,520
that so-called farmer's place

452
00:46:31,553 --> 00:46:33,288
and make sure Curry
don't skedaddle.

453
00:46:33,321 --> 00:46:35,190
(spits) Gladly.

454
00:46:36,591 --> 00:46:38,661
Don't make a move till
we get there.

455
00:46:40,328 --> 00:46:41,196
Fine.

456
00:46:42,765 --> 00:46:45,035
- KETCHUM: Duggan.
- I said fine.

457
00:46:50,739 --> 00:46:52,042
(Ketchum sniffs)

458
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:56,245
Come sunup, you and me
will head into Chickasha,

459
00:46:56,277 --> 00:46:57,546
hire some guns.

460
00:46:58,346 --> 00:46:59,582
Understood.

461
00:47:01,116 --> 00:47:05,087
On the way, we'll pay a call
on Farmer Hobbs...

462
00:47:05,721 --> 00:47:07,657
find out if he's got
anything interesting

463
00:47:07,689 --> 00:47:10,559
to tell us about ol'
Henry McCarty.

464
00:47:10,593 --> 00:47:12,295
- (insects chirping)
- (horses approaching)

465
00:47:36,419 --> 00:47:38,989
(rooster crows)

466
00:48:01,676 --> 00:48:03,680
(roosters clucking)

467
00:48:07,283 --> 00:48:09,018
(Wyatt sniffs)

468
00:48:12,421 --> 00:48:15,158
HENRY: Wyatt.
Come on in.

469
00:48:17,125 --> 00:48:19,495
- WYATT: I'm almost finished.
- Leave it till morning.

470
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:22,698
Come on.

471
00:48:32,841 --> 00:48:34,544
(door opens, closes)

472
00:48:43,685 --> 00:48:45,055
(Curry slurps)

473
00:48:46,122 --> 00:48:47,723
(Curry clears throat)

474
00:48:50,326 --> 00:48:52,262
(Curry slurps, gulps)

475
00:48:53,596 --> 00:48:56,565
It'd be a damn sight easier
if I could feed myself.

476
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,402
(Curry slurps)

477
00:48:59,435 --> 00:49:02,205
Be a damn sight easier
not to feed you at all.

478
00:49:18,888 --> 00:49:21,758
- You and me ever met?
- That I'd remember.

479
00:49:24,627 --> 00:49:26,196
How long you been a sheriff?

480
00:49:30,366 --> 00:49:35,238
- I'd say onto 18 years now.
- How'd you get your start?

481
00:49:36,172 --> 00:49:38,174
I was a deputy for Big
Bill Thompson

482
00:49:38,207 --> 00:49:39,241
in Baxter Springs.

483
00:49:40,176 --> 00:49:44,279
Baxter Springs.
Baxter Springs, Missouri?

484
00:49:45,647 --> 00:49:49,218
- Kansas.
- Skinny fella, big ears?

485
00:49:51,587 --> 00:49:52,855
Heavyset.

486
00:49:52,888 --> 00:49:54,824
Missing part of his
left ear from

487
00:49:54,857 --> 00:49:57,326
a drunk miner taking a
potshot at him.

488
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:00,797
- I heard it was a drunk whore.
- Oh, you did?

489
00:50:03,531 --> 00:50:05,734
Which part of Baxter Springs
you live in?

490
00:50:07,602 --> 00:50:11,339
A boarding house.
Out near Grant's Stage Station.

491
00:50:11,372 --> 00:50:13,142
What was the landlady's name?

492
00:50:14,676 --> 00:50:16,512
She weren't no lady.
(chuckles softly)

493
00:50:18,214 --> 00:50:20,517
She a nasty ol' cuss
named Hannah.

494
00:50:23,218 --> 00:50:25,887
You ever run into a
George Crook?

495
00:50:25,921 --> 00:50:28,290
You mean General George?

496
00:50:28,823 --> 00:50:30,258
Sumbitch dedicated his life

497
00:50:30,292 --> 00:50:32,428
to driving the Caddo out
of the Territory.

498
00:50:43,439 --> 00:50:44,841
(silverware clinks)

499
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:47,310
(Curry slurps)

500
00:50:50,946 --> 00:50:53,850
How in the hell did you end up
in Baxter Springs?

501
00:50:55,718 --> 00:50:57,886
Well, like every other fool

502
00:50:57,919 --> 00:51:00,255
dreaming of easy riches
and digging for tin.

503
00:51:00,955 --> 00:51:02,591
Till I realized there
weren't none.

504
00:51:03,392 --> 00:51:04,926
Just a bunch of ghost stories
about a mine

505
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,562
near Smokey Hill River.

506
00:51:06,594 --> 00:51:09,198
Then I... I was broke.
Work was hard to come by.

507
00:51:09,598 --> 00:51:11,734
I'm lucky Big Bill took
a liking to me.

508
00:51:11,767 --> 00:51:15,337
Otherwise I... I don't know
what would have come of me.

509
00:51:18,741 --> 00:51:21,444
I... I'm sorry I jumped
your boy before.

510
00:51:23,279 --> 00:51:25,848
I woke up in a strange place,
didn't know who he was...

511
00:51:26,482 --> 00:51:28,985
I was being held hostage
in some hideout.

512
00:51:29,018 --> 00:51:31,354
This look like a hideout to you?

513
00:51:33,888 --> 00:51:35,892
I overheard what he
said earlier.

514
00:51:36,892 --> 00:51:38,627
He didn't mean any of that.

515
00:51:40,495 --> 00:51:41,597
Yes, he did.

516
00:51:53,741 --> 00:51:54,843
(slurps)

517
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:56,912
(sighs)

518
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:02,384
I'll give you one hand free.
Don't make me take it off.

519
00:52:02,817 --> 00:52:03,852
All right.

520
00:52:06,989 --> 00:52:08,458
(sighs)

521
00:52:09,625 --> 00:52:10,994
All right.

522
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:15,397
- (Curry slurps)
- (silverware clinks)

523
00:52:21,703 --> 00:52:24,806
(Curry groans, slurps, sighs)

524
00:52:26,607 --> 00:52:28,277
(Curry chuckles)

525
00:52:30,946 --> 00:52:32,781
Was farming what your daddy did?

526
00:52:33,781 --> 00:52:37,286
My daddy died when I was 3,
up in Kansas.

527
00:52:38,087 --> 00:52:40,757
And he did near everything
but work the land.

528
00:52:42,123 --> 00:52:43,959
I was orphaned at 15.

529
00:52:45,694 --> 00:52:47,964
That's 13 years longer
than I knew my folks.

530
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:51,800
HENRY:
Ah. Whereabouts you grow up?

531
00:52:53,835 --> 00:52:54,837
New Mexico.

532
00:52:56,437 --> 00:52:58,473
- Which part?
- Fort Sumner.

533
00:52:58,506 --> 00:53:00,309
Born and raised.
You heard of it?

534
00:53:05,413 --> 00:53:07,482
Where Billy the Kid was shot,
wasn't it?

535
00:53:09,785 --> 00:53:11,587
Main reason anyone know it.

536
00:53:13,589 --> 00:53:15,591
(glass filling)

537
00:53:17,024 --> 00:53:18,860
I was there the night
it happened.

538
00:53:22,598 --> 00:53:23,933
How's that?

539
00:53:23,966 --> 00:53:25,968
I was just a boy.

540
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,136
I used to make what
money I could

541
00:53:27,169 --> 00:53:30,605
doing chores for a fella
by the name of Peter Maxwell.

542
00:53:31,105 --> 00:53:33,875
Same Peter Maxwell
put the Kid up for the night.

543
00:53:33,908 --> 00:53:35,643
Same Peter Maxwell
tipped off Garrett

544
00:53:35,676 --> 00:53:37,445
and his deputies, Poe
and McKinney,

545
00:53:37,479 --> 00:53:39,114
the Kid was holed up there.

546
00:53:39,147 --> 00:53:40,815
I was sweeping the stalls.

547
00:53:40,848 --> 00:53:43,452
When I saw Garrett walk in
the house, I...

548
00:53:44,018 --> 00:53:45,421
I don't think nothing of it.

549
00:53:46,888 --> 00:53:50,392
But Billy wasn't in there.
Not then, leastways.

550
00:53:50,426 --> 00:53:52,428
- Know how I know?
- How?

551
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:54,029
He was barefoot
in his shin sleeves,

552
00:53:54,062 --> 00:53:55,730
cutting the meat off
a deer carcass

553
00:53:55,763 --> 00:53:57,599
not 20 feet from where
I was working.

554
00:54:02,171 --> 00:54:03,939
I saw him peer through
the barn door,

555
00:54:03,971 --> 00:54:06,375
and he saw Poe and McKinney
on the porch there.

556
00:54:07,709 --> 00:54:10,513
He stopped carving,
looked me dead in my eye.

557
00:54:10,546 --> 00:54:14,149
He said, "Keep your head down,
you'll be all right."

558
00:54:15,783 --> 00:54:17,652
So Billy went straight to
Maxwell's room,

559
00:54:17,685 --> 00:54:20,390
realized pretty quick
it ain't just Maxwell in there.

560
00:54:22,056 --> 00:54:25,527
He called out,
"¿Quien es? ¿Quien es?"

561
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,863
'Cause Billy spoke Spanish
as good as a Mexican.

562
00:54:29,031 --> 00:54:30,900
Pat's answer?

563
00:54:31,667 --> 00:54:35,938
Two shots. One wide of the mark,
and the other one in the chest.

564
00:54:40,642 --> 00:54:42,411
That was the end of
Billy the Kid.

565
00:54:45,747 --> 00:54:47,616
And you seen it all.

566
00:54:47,649 --> 00:54:49,018
I most certainly did.

567
00:54:49,051 --> 00:54:50,853
Saw the Kid's body get
hauled off too,

568
00:54:50,886 --> 00:54:52,088
wrapped in a bloody sheet.

569
00:54:53,955 --> 00:54:55,890
Enough to teach me
that ain't no life for me.

570
00:54:55,924 --> 00:54:58,828
I'd rather stop this crazy
than be part of it anyway.

571
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:13,975
(knife scraping)

572
00:55:21,116 --> 00:55:23,119
(knife cutting rope)

573
00:55:24,218 --> 00:55:25,620
HENRY: Well...

574
00:55:25,654 --> 00:55:27,156
(chuckles) Damn.

575
00:55:27,189 --> 00:55:29,024
If I knew all it took
was a good story

576
00:55:29,056 --> 00:55:30,259
for you to cut me loose.

577
00:55:30,292 --> 00:55:31,727
(knife clatters)

578
00:55:32,995 --> 00:55:35,531
You well enough to stay upright
in the saddle?

579
00:55:37,598 --> 00:55:39,868
- Not hardly.
- I want you out of here.

580
00:55:40,669 --> 00:55:43,105
I suppose waiting till sunup
ain't an option?

581
00:55:43,138 --> 00:55:45,641
If I was alone out here,
it'd be different.

582
00:55:46,274 --> 00:55:47,876
Well, then, I guess I'm ready.

583
00:55:50,044 --> 00:55:50,946
Good.

584
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:55,618
Take it.

585
00:56:01,556 --> 00:56:02,758
I'll fetch your loot.

586
00:56:04,759 --> 00:56:06,629
(footsteps)

587
00:56:08,629 --> 00:56:12,234
(gunshots)

588
00:56:16,705 --> 00:56:18,908
(gunshot, glass shatters)

589
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:20,942
(Curry grunts, groans)

590
00:56:24,712 --> 00:56:26,815
(Curry pants)

591
00:56:31,185 --> 00:56:33,055
(effort grunts)

592
00:56:34,855 --> 00:56:37,158
(gunfire continues)

593
00:56:38,326 --> 00:56:40,129
- Pa?
- Wyatt! Get down!

594
00:56:40,161 --> 00:56:41,564
(Wyatt pants)

595
00:56:42,663 --> 00:56:43,698
- (gunshot)
- (glass breaking)

596
00:56:43,732 --> 00:56:44,800
I-I think I'm all right.

597
00:56:46,935 --> 00:56:47,969
Is... is he hit?

598
00:56:48,937 --> 00:56:50,205
(pistol slides across floor)

599
00:56:55,676 --> 00:56:58,213
He just passed out.
Give me that.

600
00:56:59,348 --> 00:57:01,083
I'm better with it
than you think.

601
00:57:01,116 --> 00:57:02,985
Not until I teach you proper.

602
00:57:03,018 --> 00:57:04,820
- I've taught myself
- Shush.

603
00:57:06,355 --> 00:57:07,823
(softly) Now, where'd
you get to?

604
00:57:10,692 --> 00:57:12,828
(quiet movements below)

605
00:57:15,062 --> 00:57:16,598
- WYATT: He's under the house.
- HENRY: Shh.

606
00:57:22,803 --> 00:57:24,839
(wood creaking)

607
00:57:28,377 --> 00:57:30,746
(cocks pistol)

608
00:57:38,654 --> 00:57:39,755
- (wood creaking)
- (gunshot)

609
00:57:44,893 --> 00:57:46,128
(creaking resumes)

610
00:57:50,265 --> 00:57:52,134
(softly) I hope you got
good enough with this.

611
00:57:54,136 --> 00:57:56,238
God forbid it happens,
but shooting a man

612
00:57:56,270 --> 00:57:58,306
is different than
hitting a target...

613
00:57:58,339 --> 00:58:00,776
a line you can't
cross back over.

614
00:58:00,808 --> 00:58:01,609
I know that.

615
00:58:01,643 --> 00:58:03,312
You couldn't until
you've done it.

616
00:58:05,413 --> 00:58:06,781
If he comes in here...

617
00:58:07,815 --> 00:58:09,084
you pull that trigger.

618
00:58:10,852 --> 00:58:12,221
Aim for the chest.

619
00:58:12,254 --> 00:58:15,156
And keep firing
until you hit it.

620
00:58:36,277 --> 00:58:37,779
(gunshots)

621
00:58:38,747 --> 00:58:40,915
- (gunshots continue)
- Where you going?

622
00:58:43,185 --> 00:58:44,387
(Wyatt grunts)

623
00:58:44,953 --> 00:58:47,123
(door unlocks, opens)

624
00:58:55,797 --> 00:58:57,166
DUGGAN:
Son of a bitch!

625
00:58:57,799 --> 00:58:58,934
Cocksucker!

626
00:58:59,401 --> 00:59:01,169
- Fuck.
- (shells clattering)

627
00:59:03,205 --> 00:59:04,806
(shotgun clicks)

628
00:59:08,442 --> 00:59:09,944
DUGGAN: Shit.

629
00:59:09,977 --> 00:59:12,213
(indistinct chatter)

630
00:59:13,448 --> 00:59:14,716
(Duggan grunts)

631
00:59:16,384 --> 00:59:19,221
(Duggan groans, strains)

632
00:59:20,221 --> 00:59:21,957
(thunder crashes)

633
00:59:22,924 --> 00:59:24,226
(Duggan grunts)

634
00:59:26,828 --> 00:59:28,263
(thunder rumbling)

635
00:59:28,296 --> 00:59:30,466
(Duncan grunts, whimpers)

636
00:59:30,498 --> 00:59:32,234
(struggling sounds)

637
00:59:32,267 --> 00:59:33,935
(Duggan groans)

638
00:59:35,203 --> 00:59:38,873
- (Duggan screams)
- (bone breaking)

639
00:59:38,906 --> 00:59:42,210
- (Duggan gasps)
- Where's the others? They close?

640
00:59:42,243 --> 00:59:43,479
DUGGAN: Go to hell.

641
00:59:43,511 --> 00:59:44,846
- (Henry strains)
- (Duggan chokes)

642
00:59:44,879 --> 00:59:46,314
HENRY: I've been here
too often to let

643
00:59:46,348 --> 00:59:49,317
a man of your caliber
overhaul my baggage.

644
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:51,219
- (Henry pants)
- (Duggan gasps)

645
00:59:51,252 --> 00:59:54,055
Answer me, or it ends for
you right now.

646
00:59:54,089 --> 00:59:55,424
(Duggan breathes shakily)

647
00:59:55,457 --> 00:59:57,058
DUGGAN: Go to hell,
you bastard.

648
00:59:57,091 --> 00:59:59,227
(Duggan whimpers, gasps)

649
01:00:01,395 --> 01:00:03,198
(Duggan struggles)

650
01:00:04,165 --> 01:00:06,267
- (Duggan chokes)
- (Henry strains)

651
01:00:07,268 --> 01:00:09,004
(Duggan gasps)

652
01:00:09,904 --> 01:00:11,140
(Duggan grunts)

653
01:00:13,274 --> 01:00:14,142
(Duggan whimpers)

654
01:00:16,243 --> 01:00:17,512
(Duggan chokes, gasps)

655
01:00:18,379 --> 01:00:19,848
(Duggan whimpers)

656
01:00:26,421 --> 01:00:28,290
- (Henry sighs)
- (thunder rumbles)

657
01:00:31,393 --> 01:00:33,195
(thunder crashes)

658
01:00:57,018 --> 01:00:58,854
He was fixin' to kill us both.

659
01:01:01,455 --> 01:01:02,524
I saw.

660
01:01:03,859 --> 01:01:06,061
Probably here to watch
and got greedy.

661
01:01:07,161 --> 01:01:09,165
- (thunder rumbles)
- The others will be coming.

662
01:01:12,366 --> 01:01:14,469
First thing, we gotta get rid
of this body.

663
01:01:15,303 --> 01:01:16,372
How we gonna do that?

664
01:01:22,477 --> 01:01:23,913
We ain't.

665
01:01:29,484 --> 01:01:31,854
(door creaks, closes)

666
01:01:46,234 --> 01:01:48,504
(pigs oinking)

667
01:02:05,053 --> 01:02:07,122
- (animal squeals)
- (pigs snort)

668
01:02:22,504 --> 01:02:24,506
HENRY: I know it don't
feel like it.

669
01:02:25,306 --> 01:02:27,408
You're lucky it just grazed ya.

670
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,216
If you know I found that gun,

671
01:02:34,248 --> 01:02:36,886
you know I saw what's
in the back of that closet.

672
01:02:39,354 --> 01:02:40,321
Who are you?

673
01:02:42,489 --> 01:02:43,625
I'm who I am.

674
01:02:45,225 --> 01:02:48,129
Aren't you always preaching
about being honest?

675
01:02:48,696 --> 01:02:50,598
The truth will set you free?

676
01:02:53,301 --> 01:02:54,904
I've never lied to you.

677
01:03:03,645 --> 01:03:05,280
Isn't not telling me
the whole story

678
01:03:05,312 --> 01:03:06,547
the same damn thing?

679
01:03:12,587 --> 01:03:15,391
I've done things
I wish I could take back.

680
01:03:16,290 --> 01:03:19,060
A long time before you.
Before your ma.

681
01:03:20,594 --> 01:03:23,165
Things that
you got no business hearing.

682
01:03:24,299 --> 01:03:27,436
How am I supposed to respect you
if you ain't respecting me?

683
01:03:27,468 --> 01:03:29,470
I am respecting you.

684
01:03:30,705 --> 01:03:32,440
And if you don't
understand that,

685
01:03:32,473 --> 01:03:34,343
you ain't heard a
word I just said.

686
01:03:35,477 --> 01:03:39,047
No, I heard it. I just
don't believe a bit of it.

687
01:03:45,754 --> 01:03:47,256
(crickets chirping)

688
01:03:50,457 --> 01:03:52,093
- (lantern rattling)
- (footsteps approach)

689
01:04:02,736 --> 01:04:04,439
- (inhales softly)
- (Curry groans)

690
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:17,386
(Billy the Kid)
Keep your head down.

691
01:04:21,622 --> 01:04:25,192
Keep your head down.
You'll be all right.

692
01:04:25,225 --> 01:04:26,260
(echoing) You'll be all right.

693
01:04:26,294 --> 01:04:31,633
(intensified breathing sounds)

694
01:04:51,151 --> 01:04:53,120
(door creaks, closes)

695
01:04:53,154 --> 01:04:55,024
(distant birdsong)

696
01:05:12,306 --> 01:05:14,142
(rocking chair squeaks)

697
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:08,629
(birds fluttering)

698
01:06:10,464 --> 01:06:11,600
(rifle cocks)

699
01:06:13,768 --> 01:06:15,104
(chickens clucking)

700
01:06:22,377 --> 01:06:23,479
(sheep bleating)

701
01:06:24,245 --> 01:06:25,279
(horses approaching)

702
01:06:25,312 --> 01:06:26,747
- Whoa.
- (chickens clucking)

703
01:06:30,484 --> 01:06:32,187
(distant sheep bleating)

704
01:06:34,888 --> 01:06:36,657
- Morning
- AL: Morning.

705
01:06:37,792 --> 01:06:40,661
- Something I can help you with?
- I sure hope so.

706
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:45,834
Nice place you got here.
Peaceful. Quiet.

707
01:06:48,402 --> 01:06:49,504
Bird hunting.

708
01:06:50,437 --> 01:06:52,740
Nothing quite like the
flush of the bevy.

709
01:06:54,642 --> 01:06:56,145
You must be quite the shot.

710
01:06:58,546 --> 01:06:59,647
Do what I can.

711
01:07:00,647 --> 01:07:01,816
I envy you.

712
01:07:03,283 --> 01:07:04,486
I don't get to go out hunting

713
01:07:04,518 --> 01:07:05,921
as much as I'd like
to these days.

714
01:07:07,422 --> 01:07:08,891
Something I can help
you with, mister?

715
01:07:11,491 --> 01:07:13,394
My daddy used to hunt pheasant.

716
01:07:13,962 --> 01:07:16,431
It was always
my damn job to clean 'em.

717
01:07:18,299 --> 01:07:21,370
Oh, cutting the skin on
the breast, peeling it back.

718
01:07:22,971 --> 01:07:25,407
But over time, I
figured the best way

719
01:07:25,439 --> 01:07:27,441
to get rid of their innards...

720
01:07:28,576 --> 01:07:32,447
was to split the bird's back.
Get to 'em that way.

721
01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:36,750
Is that what you find?

722
01:07:36,783 --> 01:07:38,186
Look, I don't...

723
01:07:38,752 --> 01:07:40,588
mean to be un-neighborly, but...

724
01:07:40,989 --> 01:07:43,625
But get to the point? Sure.

725
01:07:45,859 --> 01:07:47,962
I wanted to ask you a
couple questions about, uh,

726
01:07:47,995 --> 01:07:49,897
your brother-in-law.

727
01:07:51,565 --> 01:07:53,334
Well, what concern is
he of yours?

728
01:07:54,468 --> 01:07:56,204
That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

729
01:07:57,337 --> 01:07:59,440
You see, I got this
crazy idea...

730
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:01,843
there might be more to ol'
McCarty

731
01:08:01,875 --> 01:08:02,777
than meets the eye.

732
01:08:03,979 --> 01:08:05,814
(sighs) You supposed be some
kind of lawman or something?

733
01:08:06,547 --> 01:08:08,283
Something like that.

734
01:08:09,350 --> 01:08:10,953
Well, I think it's
time you left.

735
01:08:11,718 --> 01:08:13,754
Well, we came here for
some answers.

736
01:08:15,790 --> 01:08:17,859
We ain't leaving till I get 'em.

737
01:08:17,892 --> 01:08:19,228
That so?

738
01:08:23,864 --> 01:08:25,500
- I should... (grunts)
- (horse neighs)

739
01:08:30,037 --> 01:08:33,274
(sighs) Now how the hell
we gonna pick his ass up?

740
01:08:36,678 --> 01:08:38,447
(Curry groans, whimpers)

741
01:08:40,648 --> 01:08:42,684
(Curry groans, exhales)

742
01:08:42,716 --> 01:08:45,886
(labored breath)
Okay. Okay, thank you.

743
01:08:47,054 --> 01:08:48,656
(Curry groans)

744
01:08:50,358 --> 01:08:51,760
- (bed creaks)
- (Curry strains)

745
01:08:53,661 --> 01:08:55,663
(labored breath)

746
01:08:56,863 --> 01:08:58,599
(Curry whimpers)

747
01:09:00,367 --> 01:09:02,469
- Oh, God. Okay.
- (bed creaks)

748
01:09:02,502 --> 01:09:06,040
I'm no good to travel. I'm not.

749
01:09:07,709 --> 01:09:09,411
You take the boy,
you get out of here.

750
01:09:10,644 --> 01:09:11,812
When Ketchum and his men arrive,

751
01:09:11,845 --> 01:09:13,482
I'll hold them off as
long as I can.

752
01:09:14,381 --> 01:09:16,018
- The hell with that!
- Wyatt.

753
01:09:17,018 --> 01:09:18,654
We got guns.

754
01:09:19,386 --> 01:09:21,456
You already killed one of
them barehanded.

755
01:09:21,488 --> 01:09:24,358
Fill a pack. We're leaving.

756
01:09:24,392 --> 01:09:25,859
(labored breath)

757
01:09:25,893 --> 01:09:27,562
(Henry, softly)
I'm warning you.

758
01:09:28,662 --> 01:09:29,665
(scoffs softly)

759
01:09:34,102 --> 01:09:37,738
(Curry panting)

760
01:09:37,772 --> 01:09:39,841
(birds chirping)

761
01:09:54,988 --> 01:09:56,491
He's back.

762
01:10:06,533 --> 01:10:07,367
Leave the rest.

763
01:10:07,402 --> 01:10:09,504
We can't just leave
him here to die.

764
01:10:09,537 --> 01:10:10,839
I am damn sure not
gonna lose you

765
01:10:10,871 --> 01:10:12,639
over something that
ain't our fight.

766
01:10:12,672 --> 01:10:13,875
Your pa's right.

767
01:10:13,907 --> 01:10:15,809
I am old enough to make
my own decisions,

768
01:10:15,843 --> 01:10:17,812
whether you are ready
to accept that or not.

769
01:10:17,845 --> 01:10:20,548
Yeah. (grunts)
This is mine to finish.

770
01:10:20,581 --> 01:10:22,017
Go on, now. I'll be all right.

771
01:10:33,027 --> 01:10:35,130
(horses whinnying)

772
01:10:46,506 --> 01:10:48,910
(horses whinnying)

773
01:10:54,514 --> 01:10:55,383
Whoa.

774
01:10:59,153 --> 01:11:02,623
(shouts) Curry!
Anybody home?

775
01:11:04,058 --> 01:11:06,060
(shouts) You gentlemen
need something?

776
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:08,897
We're here for our fugitive.

777
01:11:09,529 --> 01:11:11,767
HENRY: I told you yesterday
I ain't seen him.

778
01:11:12,966 --> 01:11:15,636
KETCHUM: My intuition tells
me that's not true.

779
01:11:17,071 --> 01:11:18,773
I'll make it easy...

780
01:11:18,805 --> 01:11:21,910
you hand him over,
we let you and the boy go free.

781
01:11:23,176 --> 01:11:26,514
KETCHUM: The other option is,
we take him.

782
01:11:26,546 --> 01:11:28,116
And you and the boy die.

783
01:11:29,550 --> 01:11:31,619
You take that deal.
(breathes shakily)

784
01:11:31,652 --> 01:11:33,555
I signed up for this,
you didn't.

785
01:11:38,225 --> 01:11:40,594
KETCHUM: See your horses
are already saddled.

786
01:11:40,627 --> 01:11:42,831
You can just ride on
out of here.

787
01:11:47,835 --> 01:11:49,604
You and I both know
we'll be dead

788
01:11:49,636 --> 01:11:50,971
before we mount our horses.

789
01:11:54,207 --> 01:11:57,545
(shouts) 'Fore this turns
into some kinda brigasee,

790
01:11:57,577 --> 01:11:59,781
why don't me and you
settle this,

791
01:11:59,813 --> 01:12:01,081
knuckle and skull.

792
01:12:01,114 --> 01:12:02,550
(laughs)

793
01:12:03,984 --> 01:12:06,188
You got a lot of fight
for a farmer.

794
01:12:07,255 --> 01:12:09,123
That ain't the way
this plays out.

795
01:12:11,192 --> 01:12:12,461
(shouts) Bring him up!

796
01:12:25,072 --> 01:12:26,141
Al?

797
01:12:47,694 --> 01:12:48,964
(shells rattling)

798
01:12:52,166 --> 01:12:54,035
Listen to me. What's
gonna happen

799
01:12:54,068 --> 01:12:55,203
will happen quick.

800
01:12:55,236 --> 01:12:58,238
I'll stall long as I can,
but I want you to sneak out back

801
01:12:58,272 --> 01:13:00,108
- and hole up at Roger's Mill...
- (cocks gun)

802
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:01,643
...and wait for me there.

803
01:13:02,042 --> 01:13:04,077
Only use this if you have to.

804
01:13:04,111 --> 01:13:06,147
- Let me fight.
- I can't do this right

805
01:13:06,179 --> 01:13:07,981
if I'm worried about
protecting you.

806
01:13:08,014 --> 01:13:09,617
CURRY: Just turn me over.

807
01:13:10,585 --> 01:13:12,554
You don't, they're gonna
kill us all. (breathes shakily)

808
01:13:12,586 --> 01:13:13,354
You and me both know

809
01:13:13,388 --> 01:13:14,988
they're fixin' to do
that anyway.

810
01:13:15,022 --> 01:13:17,626
And yet you expect me
to run out into sure gunfire?

811
01:13:18,059 --> 01:13:19,160
CURRY: Your boy's right.

812
01:13:25,099 --> 01:13:26,601
Stay inside.

813
01:13:26,634 --> 01:13:28,670
Stay away from the window.

814
01:13:28,702 --> 01:13:31,205
You have to shoot,
aim for the chest, and...

815
01:13:31,237 --> 01:13:32,940
Keep firing till I
hit something.

816
01:13:39,212 --> 01:13:40,081
(door opens)

817
01:13:43,684 --> 01:13:45,554
(door closes)

818
01:13:50,957 --> 01:13:52,160
KETCHUM: I've had
some suspicions

819
01:13:52,193 --> 01:13:54,563
about who you are,
Henry McCarty.

820
01:13:57,063 --> 01:14:01,569
I got to admit, that name
sticks in me like a thorn.

821
01:14:01,969 --> 01:14:04,239
My curiosity was aroused.

822
01:14:05,739 --> 01:14:08,242
I was hoping Al here
might shed some light.

823
01:14:09,977 --> 01:14:11,813
He wouldn't say shit.

824
01:14:12,813 --> 01:14:14,916
Even after my boys were...

825
01:14:14,948 --> 01:14:18,752
what's the word?
Uh, emphatic in their question.

826
01:14:20,987 --> 01:14:23,057
KETCHUM: You probably
concluded I'm no sheriff.

827
01:14:23,991 --> 01:14:25,993
Nor are these men my deputies.

828
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:28,830
Not a one of us had spent time

829
01:14:28,862 --> 01:14:30,998
in Woods County
before a month ago.

830
01:14:32,399 --> 01:14:33,602
What about you?

831
01:14:35,001 --> 01:14:36,337
Where'd you come from?

832
01:14:37,404 --> 01:14:39,907
Every place on earth but this.

833
01:14:42,809 --> 01:14:44,077
So be it.

834
01:14:44,111 --> 01:14:45,279
Last offer.

835
01:14:47,148 --> 01:14:48,883
This tongue-tied piece of shit

836
01:14:48,916 --> 01:14:50,752
for Sheriff Curry in there
and the money.

837
01:14:51,251 --> 01:14:52,687
You get what you want.

838
01:14:53,086 --> 01:14:54,288
I get what I want.

839
01:14:54,955 --> 01:14:57,925
We go our separate ways
without blood spilled.

840
01:14:58,959 --> 01:15:01,696
Not yours, not mine.

841
01:15:02,228 --> 01:15:04,131
Not that boy of yours I
see surveilling

842
01:15:04,165 --> 01:15:05,734
all this through that window.

843
01:15:08,001 --> 01:15:09,169
If I wanted bloodshed,

844
01:15:09,202 --> 01:15:12,139
I'd have busted in there guns
a-blazin' a long time ago.

845
01:15:13,474 --> 01:15:15,110
I believe you know that.

846
01:15:15,843 --> 01:15:18,846
You leave my brother-in-law
right where he is.

847
01:15:19,714 --> 01:15:22,884
Turn and ride your asses
off my property.

848
01:15:22,916 --> 01:15:26,120
You do that, and I'll
let you live.

849
01:15:27,054 --> 01:15:28,723
(chuckles, mutters indistinctly)

850
01:15:30,457 --> 01:15:32,359
You hear that, fellas?

851
01:15:32,393 --> 01:15:35,029
Is that the talk of a
mild old sodbuster?

852
01:15:35,062 --> 01:15:37,064
- (chuckling)
- I think not.

853
01:15:38,331 --> 01:15:39,334
Nah.

854
01:15:40,268 --> 01:15:42,671
That sounds like
something else altogether.

855
01:15:44,170 --> 01:15:45,039
Hobbs!

856
01:15:46,273 --> 01:15:49,076
Anything you could tell me
might change the equation here?

857
01:15:50,443 --> 01:15:52,179
(spits)

858
01:15:52,212 --> 01:15:55,450
Kiss my ass,
you long-winded son of a bitch.

859
01:15:58,786 --> 01:16:01,756
You got a pair, I'll
give you that.

860
01:16:05,358 --> 01:16:06,794
Last chance, Al.

861
01:16:10,197 --> 01:16:15,937
You have no idea the hell storm
you fixin' to let loose.

862
01:16:18,973 --> 01:16:20,975
Consider me properly warned.

863
01:16:27,782 --> 01:16:30,385
KETCHUM: Easy. Whoa.

864
01:16:33,853 --> 01:16:34,988
Easy, fella.

865
01:16:42,395 --> 01:16:44,933
(blows) Goddamn.

866
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:47,402
Look at that.

867
01:16:48,402 --> 01:16:50,104
I'd say she's done.

868
01:16:50,136 --> 01:16:52,139
Ain't that a thing of beauty?

869
01:16:59,546 --> 01:17:00,482
Wyatt!

870
01:17:02,515 --> 01:17:05,519
(gunfire)

871
01:17:05,553 --> 01:17:06,755
Get in!

872
01:17:08,555 --> 01:17:11,224
- (gunfire continues)
- (door slams)

873
01:17:11,258 --> 01:17:12,926
- (glass shatters)
- (Curry grunts)

874
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:15,363
- (Curry groans)
- (glass shattering)

875
01:17:16,897 --> 01:17:17,899
You still with us?

876
01:17:18,232 --> 01:17:20,468
(groans) Less of me. (grunts)

877
01:17:21,902 --> 01:17:23,872
- Whoa. Whoa.
- (glass breaking)

878
01:17:25,171 --> 01:17:27,274
(Wyatt pants, coughs)

879
01:17:28,375 --> 01:17:30,111
(pistol cocks)

880
01:17:30,144 --> 01:17:31,146
(shouts) McCarty!

881
01:17:33,313 --> 01:17:35,048
You dead yet?

882
01:17:35,849 --> 01:17:37,117
HENRY: I sure ain't.

883
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:38,952
KETCHUM: I'm assuming the fact
I ain't seen

884
01:17:38,986 --> 01:17:41,255
my man Duggan this morning

885
01:17:41,287 --> 01:17:44,058
means he must have crossed
paths with you,

886
01:17:44,090 --> 01:17:45,926
and things didn't go his way.

887
01:17:48,328 --> 01:17:51,933
Seeing as how I just killed
your man Al here,

888
01:17:51,965 --> 01:17:53,468
I'd say that squares us.

889
01:17:54,568 --> 01:17:56,103
No more games.

890
01:17:56,135 --> 01:17:58,806
You got one minute to come out.

891
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:02,376
You nearly got us both killed,

892
01:18:02,408 --> 01:18:04,277
which is about all your
tears and rage

893
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:05,446
would have amounted to.

894
01:18:07,915 --> 01:18:11,385
Now keep your damn head down.
You'll be all right.

895
01:18:11,417 --> 01:18:13,520
(Curry pants)

896
01:18:18,224 --> 01:18:19,526
(Billy the Kid, echoing)
Keep your head down,

897
01:18:19,559 --> 01:18:21,161
you'll be all right.

898
01:18:28,368 --> 01:18:30,371
Poe and McKinney were
on the porch.

899
01:18:32,206 --> 01:18:33,408
Garrett went in the house.

900
01:18:37,510 --> 01:18:39,513
(cocks pistol)

901
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:43,084
Two shots... but he...

902
01:18:44,184 --> 01:18:48,223
(chuckles) And you were
speaking Spanish to 'em. (pants)

903
01:18:51,658 --> 01:18:53,193
But he didn't kill you.

904
01:18:53,993 --> 01:18:55,630
He helped you escape.

905
01:18:57,063 --> 01:18:58,332
You're him.

906
01:19:01,268 --> 01:19:02,470
He's who?

907
01:19:05,104 --> 01:19:06,306
Bonney.

908
01:19:07,508 --> 01:19:09,010
Pa, what is he talking about?

909
01:19:19,019 --> 01:19:21,122
- (door opens)
- WYATT: Pa!

910
01:19:28,162 --> 01:19:29,964
Smart choice, friend.

911
01:19:34,568 --> 01:19:35,636
(Stillwell speaks Spanish)

912
01:19:35,669 --> 01:19:38,572
(Henry speaks Spanish)

913
01:19:38,604 --> 01:19:41,675
(both speaking Spanish)

914
01:19:42,576 --> 01:19:43,578
What's he saying?

915
01:19:48,047 --> 01:19:49,651
- (horse whinnying)
- (man cries out)

916
01:19:52,318 --> 01:19:53,921
(gunfire continues)

(Henry pants)

925
01:20:20,014 --> 01:20:23,051
Don't you dare step outside.

926
01:20:27,086 --> 01:20:29,723
(door squeaks)

927

(pants)

979
01:25:43,502 --> 01:25:44,537
(pistol mechanism clicks)

980
01:25:44,571 --> 01:25:45,672
(snarls)

981
01:25:47,006 --> 01:25:48,741
(Ketchum whimpers, spits)

982
01:25:48,774 --> 01:25:50,644
(Ketchum coughs)

983
01:25:51,644 --> 01:25:52,946
(Ketchum grunting)

984
01:25:54,915 --> 01:25:56,417
(cylinder spins)

985
01:26:00,821 --> 01:26:02,422
(cocks pistol)

986
01:26:51,004 --> 01:26:52,840
(Wyatt breathing shakily)

987
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:55,875
You all right? (pants)

988
01:27:03,617 --> 01:27:05,019
(Curry grunts)

989
01:27:06,118 --> 01:27:07,487
(Curry groans, pants)

990
01:27:10,890 --> 01:27:12,792
(Curry groans)

991
01:27:15,895 --> 01:27:16,897
Oh.

992
01:27:18,665 --> 01:27:20,901
(shudders, grunts, groans)

993
01:27:20,934 --> 01:27:24,805
HENRY: Wyatt. Fetch
a pail of water and some rags.

994
01:27:24,837 --> 01:27:25,805
Go on.

995
01:27:27,107 --> 01:27:28,442
(Curry exhales)

996
01:27:30,777 --> 01:27:33,680
(Curry groans, sighs)

997
01:27:33,712 --> 01:27:36,483
HENRY: You've certainly seen
better days.

998
01:27:36,515 --> 01:27:38,385
I knew you had a familiar face.

999
01:27:39,219 --> 01:27:41,654
I just couldn't place
it at first.

1000
01:27:42,555 --> 01:27:44,857
HENRY: We'll get the doc.

1001
01:27:44,890 --> 01:27:47,127
First I gotta slow the bleed.

1002
01:27:48,228 --> 01:27:50,631
How you manage
to stay hidden all these years?

1003
01:27:51,797 --> 01:27:53,867
Let's get some of this
shirt off you.

1004
01:27:53,899 --> 01:27:55,803
I can use it to tie
off this leg.

1005
01:28:06,947 --> 01:28:09,083
(gunshot)

1006
01:28:20,026 --> 01:28:22,430
(Henry chuckles)

1007
01:28:26,233 --> 01:28:28,769
(Henry groans softly)

1008
01:28:31,837 --> 01:28:33,139
(Henry sighs)

1009
01:28:33,172 --> 01:28:34,442
CURRY: Well, shit.

1010
01:28:35,675 --> 01:28:37,445
I wish you didn't see that.

1011
01:28:40,779 --> 01:28:42,483
(Henry breathes shakily)

1012
01:28:43,849 --> 01:28:46,853
(pants) It's just like I heard
you tell your boy before.

1013
01:28:47,687 --> 01:28:51,826
Ain't that I lied, I just never
told you the whole truth.

1014
01:28:53,059 --> 01:28:55,229
Was you law at all?

1015
01:28:55,261 --> 01:28:57,764
Sheriff of Woods County,
just like I said.

1016
01:28:59,131 --> 01:29:00,133
Me and my deputies,

1017
01:29:00,166 --> 01:29:02,702
we signed on with Ketchum
back in the spring.

1018
01:29:04,103 --> 01:29:05,672
We had to take their brand.

1019
01:29:07,107 --> 01:29:08,575
Done a few jobs with 'em.

1020
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:10,043
But we figured out
they was planning

1021
01:29:10,076 --> 01:29:11,612
to gun us down on this last go.

1022
01:29:13,279 --> 01:29:15,248
So we tried to beat 'em
to the punch.

1023
01:29:15,282 --> 01:29:17,751
Took off, and they plugged me
from a distance.

1024
01:29:20,019 --> 01:29:22,089
They'd have hunted me
to the end of the earth.

1025
01:29:24,291 --> 01:29:26,026
- I'm sorry I ended up here.
- (Henry scoffs softly)

1026
01:29:27,961 --> 01:29:30,164
Last thing I wanted,
you wanna know the truth of it.

1027
01:29:32,698 --> 01:29:34,067
'Cause you were good to
me back then.

1028
01:29:35,001 --> 01:29:36,003
Huh.

1029
01:29:37,103 --> 01:29:38,972
I could never square
you done the things they said.

1030
01:29:40,340 --> 01:29:42,910
Though I sure as hell
can believe it now. (chuckles)

1031
01:29:45,312 --> 01:29:49,183
(Curry whimpers, grunts)

1032
01:29:52,885 --> 01:29:54,821
I don't even remember you.

1033
01:29:55,921 --> 01:29:59,158
Well, why would you?
I was just a ranch hand.

1034
01:29:59,192 --> 01:30:00,861
(cocks pistol)

1035
01:30:00,894 --> 01:30:03,130
Now I get to be the man
who killed Billy the Kid.

1036
01:30:03,729 --> 01:30:05,198
(Curry grunts)

1037
01:30:05,931 --> 01:30:08,035
(Wyatt pants)

1038
01:30:08,068 --> 01:30:10,170
(Curry groans)

1039
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:14,074
(Wyatt exhales)

1040
01:30:15,908 --> 01:30:17,310
(Wyatt pants)

1041
01:30:17,344 --> 01:30:19,212
- You hold on, I'll get the doc.
- No.

1042
01:30:21,147 --> 01:30:22,181
Pa.

1043
01:30:22,215 --> 01:30:24,552
It's a miracle I made
it this far.

1044
01:30:27,886 --> 01:30:29,223
Once this gets out...

1045
01:30:30,657 --> 01:30:33,594
you gonna hear some
things about me.

1046
01:30:33,626 --> 01:30:34,961
Some of it's true.

1047
01:30:36,028 --> 01:30:37,330
A lot of it ain't.

1048
01:30:38,998 --> 01:30:41,234
Fact is... (chuckles)

1049
01:30:42,368 --> 01:30:45,906
I don't even know
who or what I was anymore.

1050
01:30:47,306 --> 01:30:51,245
(sighs) I don't believe
in redemption.

1051
01:30:53,345 --> 01:30:56,015
But a man can find some
kind of solace...

1052
01:30:57,983 --> 01:31:00,252
if he's got a boy like
you to raise.

1053
01:31:00,286 --> 01:31:02,122
(Wyatt whimpers)

1054
01:31:03,223 --> 01:31:04,858
The world is changing.

1055
01:31:06,992 --> 01:31:08,261
You go see it.

1056
01:31:09,962 --> 01:31:12,733
It's a place I don't belong in
no more.

1057
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:16,335
(grunts)

1058
01:31:16,368 --> 01:31:18,005
I'm hoping...

1059
01:31:19,272 --> 01:31:20,707
you do.

1060
01:31:31,151 --> 01:31:32,620
(voice breaking)
Pa?

1061
01:31:33,886 --> 01:31:35,022
Pa?

1062
01:31:36,822 --> 01:31:38,291
(whimpering)

1063
01:31:40,426 --> 01:31:42,996
(Wyatt weeps)

1064
01:33:16,121 --> 01:33:17,390
WYATT: Come on.
