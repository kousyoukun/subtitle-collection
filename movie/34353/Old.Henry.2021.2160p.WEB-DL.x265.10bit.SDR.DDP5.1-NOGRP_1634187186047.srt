1
00:01:07,982 --> 00:01:09,618
啊。
Ah.

2
00:02:15,683 --> 00:02:16,686
来吧。
Come on.

3
00:02:39,974 --> 00:02:41,043
看着我。
Look at me.

4
00:02:47,682 --> 00:02:48,884
他去哪了?
Where'd he get to?

5
00:02:57,793 --> 00:02:59,528
他去哪了?
Where'd he get to?

6
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:01,029
我不知道。
I don't know.

7
00:03:07,101 --> 00:03:08,670
不!
No!

8
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,881
把绳子。
Get the rope.

9
00:03:23,017 --> 00:03:27,522
我们的…向东，向印度领土进发。
We's... headin' east, towards indian territory.

10
00:03:30,892 --> 00:03:32,895
他的情况很糟。
He's in a bad way.

11
00:03:37,064 --> 00:03:39,068
关于这件事，你就想说这些吗?
Is that everything you have to say on the matter?

12
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,636
我发誓。我发誓!
I swear. i swear!

13
00:03:42,704 --> 00:03:43,839
你知道吗?
You know what?

14
00:03:45,873 --> 00:03:47,575
我相信你。
I believe you.

15
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:49,479
哇。达根。
Whoa. duggan.

16
00:03:54,716 --> 00:03:55,716
哇。
Whoa.

17
00:03:56,784 --> 00:03:58,020
地狱吗?
The hell?

18
00:04:03,192 --> 00:04:05,059
你怎么知道这事会变成这样
How the hell you figure this wound up

19
00:04:05,093 --> 00:04:07,530
在这片草原的中央吗?
Out here in the middle of these grassland?

20
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,067
这会很顺利的。
This will work out nice.

21
00:04:17,905 --> 00:04:19,674
给我松绑。
Just cut me loose.

22
00:04:19,707 --> 00:04:21,753
你再也见不到我了，真的。给我松绑。
You'll never see me again, honest. just cut me loose.

23
00:04:21,777 --> 00:04:23,678
坐起来。
Sit on up.

24
00:04:23,712 --> 00:04:25,880
你看，我本想把你放了，
Well, you see, i would cut you loose,

25
00:04:25,914 --> 00:04:28,584
但这违背了我的正义感。
But that just violates my sense of what's right.

26
00:05:13,928 --> 00:05:17,032
很难分辨一个男人是谁，是什么
it can be hard to tell who and what a man is,

27
00:05:17,065 --> 00:05:19,669
他想让你相信他不是这样的
he's got a mind to convince you otherwise.

28
00:05:21,602 --> 00:05:25,174
我的家人来自纽约，我出生的地方
my people were from new york, where i was born.

29
00:05:26,207 --> 00:05:28,109
当我三岁的时候，
by the time i was three,

30
00:05:28,142 --> 00:05:31,246
我们已经到达了堪萨斯州的coffeyville
we'd made it to coffeyville, kansas,

31
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:36,251
然后去亚利桑那，然后去新墨西哥
then down to arizona, then new mexico.

32
00:05:36,284 --> 00:05:39,020
我在墨西哥待过一段时间
i was in mexico proper for a time.

33
00:05:41,123 --> 00:05:43,759
我在许多行业都干过
i've tried my hand at many a vocation.

34
00:05:46,628 --> 00:05:48,897
一些比其他的更边缘
some more marginal than others.

35
00:05:57,138 --> 00:06:01,276
最后，我决定过农民的生活
finally, i settled on the life of a farmer.

36
00:06:02,644 --> 00:06:04,080
我是什么。
which is what i am.

37
00:06:51,025 --> 00:06:53,861
我们养了那头猪，
We got that hog, stock to feed,

38
00:06:53,895 --> 00:06:55,964
还有一个地窖要填满。
And a root cellar to fill.

39
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,700
现在的拖拉机只需要四分之一的时间就能做到。
There's tractors can do this now in quarter the time.

40
00:06:58,734 --> 00:07:00,702
是这样吗?
Is that right?

41
00:07:00,736 --> 00:07:01,803
我想
And here i thought

42
00:07:01,837 --> 00:07:03,906
你的骨子里就有农业，怀亚特。
Farming was in your bones, wyatt.

43
00:07:06,073 --> 00:07:07,710
这对你来说是个好地方
This would be a good place for you

44
00:07:07,743 --> 00:07:09,211
养活自己的家庭。
To raise a family of your own.

45
00:07:09,243 --> 00:07:11,880
我知道你妈也会这么想。
I know your ma would have felt that way.

46
00:07:11,912 --> 00:07:13,081
我不是她。
I ain't her.

47
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,652
或者他。
Or him.

48
00:07:16,685 --> 00:07:19,355
房屋凭智慧建造，
By wisdom is a house built,

49
00:07:19,387 --> 00:07:21,856
这都是借着理解建立起来的。
And through understanding is it established.

50
00:07:22,724 --> 00:07:24,827
其屋因知识充满
Through knowledge are its rooms filled

51
00:07:24,859 --> 00:07:27,061
拥有稀有而美丽的珍宝。
With rare and beautiful treasures.

52
00:07:27,094 --> 00:07:30,332
踏上朝圣之路的人有福了。
And blessed are those hearts that are set on pilgrimage.

53
00:07:32,267 --> 00:07:35,303
虽然我很想留下来…
Much as i'd like to stick around...

54
00:07:35,337 --> 00:07:37,873
听你们互相引用经文…
Listen to y'all quote scripture at each other...

55
00:07:38,407 --> 00:07:39,875
我要去猎鸟。
I'm goin' bird huntin'.

56
00:07:41,842 --> 00:07:43,746
谢谢你的帮助，艾尔。
Thanks for the help, al.

57
00:07:44,412 --> 00:07:46,181
来到这里对我有好处。
It does me good to be here.

58
00:07:47,748 --> 00:07:51,621
让我觉得我和玛丽还在一起。
Makes me feel like i'm still connected to marie somehow.

59
00:07:52,854 --> 00:07:54,856
帮你叔叔拿他的东西。
Give your uncle a hand with his things.

60
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:57,926
也就是说，如果你有足够的休息时间。
That is, if you've had sufficient respite.

61
00:08:17,178 --> 00:08:19,113
谢谢你,儿子。
Thank you, son.

62
00:08:19,147 --> 00:08:20,082
是的,先生。
Yes, sir.

63
00:08:20,114 --> 00:08:21,949
我今天早上想去打猎
Yeah, i wanted to go huntin' this mornin',

64
00:08:21,983 --> 00:08:24,153
但你爸爸说他需要帮助。
But your pa said he needed some help.

65
00:08:25,152 --> 00:08:27,222
我很想哪天和你一起去。
Sure would like to go with you one of these days.

66
00:08:27,255 --> 00:08:29,925
我觉得这样不太好。
I don't think that'd go over too well.

67
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:33,395
你爸是个好人，怀亚特。
Your pa's a good man, wyatt.

68
00:08:33,428 --> 00:08:35,698
我不会让他娶我妹妹的
I wouldn't let him marry my sister

69
00:08:35,731 --> 00:08:37,033
如果我不这么认为的话。
If i didn't think so.

70
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,436
很快，你就能
Soon enough, you'll be able to

71
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:44,340
你想去哪儿就去哪儿。
Do all the travelin' and shootin' you want to.

72
00:08:45,807 --> 00:08:47,342
别为这事烦恼了。
Stop frettin' about it.

73
00:09:05,025 --> 00:09:08,097
我们晚饭吃两份排骨，其余的用烟熏。
We'll take two chops for supper and smoke the rest.

74
00:09:08,797 --> 00:09:13,101
我没时间渲染了。把它扔进围栏里。
I ain't got time to render this. throw it in the pen.

75
00:09:32,386 --> 00:09:34,489
有时候你不觉得烦吗，他们吃自己的?
Don't it bother you sometimes, they eat their own?

76
00:09:35,524 --> 00:09:37,993
对猪来说没什么区别。
Don't make no difference to a hog.

77
00:09:52,874 --> 00:09:54,510
你为什么定居在这里?
Why'd you settle here?

78
00:09:54,543 --> 00:09:56,145
那是什么意思?
What's that meant to mean?

79
00:09:57,411 --> 00:10:01,750
为什么?为什么偏偏是领土呢?
Why? why the territory, of all places?

80
00:10:03,351 --> 00:10:04,820
你可以提出要求，
You could stake a claim,

81
00:10:04,852 --> 00:10:07,021
保管一年，它是你的。
Hang onto it for a year, it was yours.

82
00:10:07,823 --> 00:10:09,991
当时看来是笔不错的交易。
Seemed like a pretty good deal at the time.

83
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,297
在枪声响起之前赶到的，你知道的。
Got here before the guns went off, you know that.

84
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,032
我还是不相信这是你想要的。
I still don't believe this is what you wanted.

85
00:10:19,568 --> 00:10:23,539
拂晓就起床，喂牲口，收割庄稼。
Up at dawn, feedin' the stock, workin' the crops.

86
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:26,275
无论热或冷，下雨或晴天。
Hot or cold, rain or shine.

87
00:10:26,308 --> 00:10:29,145
你会发现还有更糟糕的安排。
You'll discover there's worse arrangements.

88
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:39,455
爸爸?
Pa?

89
00:11:20,595 --> 00:11:22,264
放松，姑娘，就这样。
Easy, gal, that's it.

90
00:11:24,499 --> 00:11:26,869
我身边就有一匹母马吗
Had me a mare near just like this

91
00:11:26,901 --> 00:11:28,369
当我比你大不了多少的时候
When i wasn't much older than you.

92
00:11:29,236 --> 00:11:30,371
Lookie这里。
Lookie here.

93
00:11:34,042 --> 00:11:36,979
你觉得发生了什么?某种抢劫?
What do you think happened? some kind of robbery?

94
00:11:37,011 --> 00:11:39,113
――一个枪战吗?-闭嘴。
- a shootout? - shut your nonsense.

95
00:11:40,448 --> 00:11:43,018
我最好去找那个骑手。
I'd best go look for the rider.

96
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,986
好，我去备马鞍。
Yeah, i'll go saddle up.

97
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:48,122
你去照看这匹马，待在屋里等我回来。
You tend to this horse and stay inside till i get back.

98
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,092
但是如果是麻烦呢，爸爸?我可以帮你。
But what if it's trouble, pa? i can help you.

99
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,928
继续。照我说的做。
Go on. do as i say.

100
00:14:01,655 --> 00:14:02,657
你好。
Hello.

101
00:15:55,702 --> 00:15:56,704
不。
Nope.

102
00:17:16,316 --> 00:17:17,316
怀亚特!
Wyatt!

103
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,255
-他还活着吗?――几乎没有。
- is he alive? - barely.

104
00:17:21,288 --> 00:17:22,323
他独自一人吗?
Was he alone?

105
00:17:23,725 --> 00:17:28,330
没有，但我派出了十几个人在那里。
No, but i dispatched with a dozen others was there.

106
00:17:28,362 --> 00:17:29,362
帮我个忙。
Give me a hand.

107
00:17:30,331 --> 00:17:31,967
他的……他失血过多。
He's... he's lost a lot of blood.

108
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,344
他能活下来吗?
Is he gonna live?

109
00:17:42,377 --> 00:17:44,246
我想这得看我们的了。
Be up to us, i suppose.

110
00:17:44,278 --> 00:17:46,347
太远太迟了，找不到医生。
Too far and too late to fetch the doc.

111
00:17:47,047 --> 00:17:50,584
好吧，我可以去。如果有必要，我可以骑一整夜。
Well, i can go. ride all night if i have to.

112
00:17:50,618 --> 00:17:52,287
我相信你会的。
I'm sure you would.

113
00:17:53,888 --> 00:17:55,557
所以呢?
So?

114
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,859
你就待在这里。把那个女巫交出来，黑兹尔。
You'll stay right here. hand over that witch hazel.

115
00:18:05,432 --> 00:18:07,334
那是违法的。
That is an outlaw.

116
00:18:07,368 --> 00:18:09,504
在逃亡中，他把马射了下来。
On the run, shot off his horse.

117
00:18:10,505 --> 00:18:11,706
你觉得他杀了人?
You think he killed somebody?

118
00:18:11,738 --> 00:18:14,442
怀亚特，我知道的和你一样多。
Wyatt, i know just as much as you do.

119
00:18:15,442 --> 00:18:16,944
那是什么?
What's that for?

120
00:18:16,977 --> 00:18:19,948
把伤口封紧，免得他一夜之间失血过多而死。
Seal the wound tight so he don't bleed out overnight.

121
00:18:21,381 --> 00:18:24,919
不!胸部受伤时千万不要抬脚。
No! don't never elevate the feet with a chest wound.

122
00:18:34,329 --> 00:18:36,031
我见过你身上的伤疤。
I've seen the scars on your body.

123
00:18:36,063 --> 00:18:37,932
因为我不会瞒着你。
'cause i ain't hid 'em from you.

124
00:18:38,932 --> 00:18:41,669
现在也许你会理解你的成长。
Now maybe you'll understand your raisin'.

125
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,038
把你的手放在这里。
Put your hand right here.

126
00:18:48,876 --> 00:18:49,811
你会在哪里?
Where you goin'?

127
00:18:49,843 --> 00:18:52,280
在我回来之前继续施压。
Just keep applyin' pressure till i get back.

128
00:21:40,948 --> 00:21:42,049
现在该做什么?
What now?

129
00:21:42,082 --> 00:21:45,519
子弹一定会出来的。他也不会来的。
Bullet's gotta come out. and he won't make the ride.

130
00:21:46,954 --> 00:21:48,223
一半的绳子。
Half that rope.

131
00:22:01,002 --> 00:22:02,571
我去叫医生来。
I'll fetch the doc.

132
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,974
你留在这里看着他。
You'll stay here and keep an eye on him.

133
00:22:13,147 --> 00:22:15,183
你真的认为有必要吗?
You really think that's necessary?

134
00:22:15,216 --> 00:22:17,118
没有必要。
It ain't not necessary.

135
00:22:18,151 --> 00:22:20,153
你给他降温吧
Now, why don't you cool his fever

136
00:22:20,187 --> 00:22:21,723
而不是在每一个
Instead of vaporizin' on every

137
00:22:21,755 --> 00:22:23,557
你脑子里有什么想法?
Thought that comes into your head?

138
00:22:53,888 --> 00:22:55,055
很冷。
Trail's cold.

139
00:22:59,627 --> 00:23:00,629
我们会得到他。
We'll get him.

140
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:32,226
那条狗能在水中追踪到鱼。
That dog could track a fish through water.

141
00:23:35,696 --> 00:23:36,698
来吧。
Come on.

142
00:23:47,108 --> 00:23:49,210
他应该醒过来，你要保持距离。
He should come to, you keep your distance.

143
00:23:49,243 --> 00:23:50,912
没关系，他被绑住了。
It don't matter he's tied up.

144
00:23:50,945 --> 00:23:52,647
我能应付自己。
I can handle myself.

145
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:55,182
你就照我说的做。我会尽快回来的。
You just do as i say. i'll be back soon as i can.

146
00:23:55,216 --> 00:23:56,217
来吧。
Come on.

147
00:26:58,265 --> 00:26:59,434
比利在哪里?
Where's billy at?

148
00:27:10,276 --> 00:27:13,280
低着头。你会没事的
keep your head down. you'll be all right.

149
00:28:25,351 --> 00:28:26,353
哇。
Whoa.

150
00:29:38,057 --> 00:29:39,259
他在这里。
He was here.

151
00:29:42,062 --> 00:29:43,664
我看不像。
Don't look like it to me.

152
00:29:52,605 --> 00:29:55,342
如果我是对的，他不是一个人。
If i'm right, he weren't alone.

153
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,616
不管是谁，都知道他在做什么。
Whoever it is knows what he's doin'.

154
00:30:05,451 --> 00:30:08,221
和我见过的所有人一样，把他的踪迹掩盖得很好。
Covered his tracks as good as anyone i've run across.

155
00:30:09,055 --> 00:30:11,359
要不是下了这场雨，我早就找到他了。
Weren't for this rain, i'd have found him sooner.

156
00:30:12,226 --> 00:30:14,996
我不需要你对内部运作侃侃而谈
I don't need you to speechify the inner workings

157
00:30:15,028 --> 00:30:17,097
在你那愚蠢的狗脑里。
In your halfwit canine mind.

158
00:30:18,332 --> 00:30:19,967
我要知道他要去哪里。
I need to know where he's headed.

159
00:30:25,104 --> 00:30:27,307
那也不能缩小范围啊。
Well, that don't exactly narrow it down.

160
00:32:16,617 --> 00:32:18,086
我在哪儿?
Where am i?

161
00:32:24,423 --> 00:32:25,492
你到底是谁?
Who the hell are you?

162
00:32:26,627 --> 00:32:29,263
我爸爸找到了你，你快死了。

163
00:32:29,295 --> 00:32:30,764
他把你带回来了。

164
00:32:30,796 --> 00:32:32,432
噢,是吗?
Oh, yeah?

165
00:32:32,466 --> 00:32:34,200
你爸是谁?
Who's your pa?

166
00:32:34,234 --> 00:32:35,236
没有人。嗯…
Nobody. uh...

167
00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:37,338
亨利。就一农民。
Henry. just a-a farmer.

168
00:32:50,449 --> 00:32:52,285
怎么，这里只有你和他吗?
What, it's only you and him here?

169
00:32:54,921 --> 00:32:56,256
他现在在这里吗?

170
00:32:59,659 --> 00:33:00,794
他就在外面。
He's just out back.

00:33:03,463 --> 00:33:05,133
在照顾猪。
Tendin' to the hogs.

172
00:33:06,967 --> 00:33:08,268
噢,是吗?
Oh, yeah?

173
00:33:12,471 --> 00:33:13,640
好吧，去找他。
Well, go fetch him.

174
00:33:27,955 --> 00:33:29,689
退出mov……移动!
Quit mov... moving!

175
00:33:31,291 --> 00:33:32,668
现在，我不想伤害你。
Right now, i don't want to hurt you.

176
00:33:32,692 --> 00:33:34,360
我不想伤害你。停止运动!
I don't want to hurt you. stop moving!

177
00:33:34,393 --> 00:33:37,297
你把我的枪和背包放哪了?听我说!
Where'd you put my gun and my satchel? listen to me!

178
00:33:37,331 --> 00:33:38,808
我不知道你在说什么，先生。
I don't know what you're talkin' about, mister.

179
00:33:38,832 --> 00:33:39,766
别对我撒谎!
Don't you lie to me!

180
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,169
你对我的枪和背包做了什么?
What'd you do with my gun and my satchel?

181
00:34:09,896 --> 00:34:11,365
爸爸!
Pa!

182
00:34:15,334 --> 00:34:17,503
他是怎么逃脱的?
How'd he get loose?

183
00:34:17,537 --> 00:34:18,739
H-he挣脱。
H-he wriggled free.

184
00:34:19,439 --> 00:34:20,874
挣脱?
Wriggled free?

185
00:34:20,907 --> 00:34:23,878
拿起我放在床头柜上的小刀。
And got hold of my knife i left on the bedstand.

186
00:34:24,977 --> 00:34:26,847
那是我们俩的责任。
Well, that's on the both of us.

187
00:34:27,881 --> 00:34:30,484
帮我把这狗娘养的绑起来。
Help me tie the son of a bitch back up.

188
00:34:59,912 --> 00:35:00,914
好吧。
Okay.

189
00:35:02,916 --> 00:35:05,785
你最好好好想想你给自己惹了什么麻烦。
You better think long and hard on what you got yourself into.

190
00:35:05,818 --> 00:35:08,655
真有趣，我也正想告诉你呢。
Funny, i was about to tell you the same thing.

191
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:12,927
你想用它做什么?
What you aimin' to do with that?

192
00:35:13,793 --> 00:35:16,663
把子弹从你身体里挖出来，
Gonna dig that bullet out of you,

193
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:18,765
也许能在这个过程中找到答案。
Maybe get some answers in the process.

194
00:35:19,465 --> 00:35:21,034
我喜欢我听到的
I like what i hear,

195
00:35:21,068 --> 00:35:24,372
我可能会给你点东西减轻你的痛苦。
I might be inclined to give you something to ease the pain.

196
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:32,912
不。
No.

197
00:35:33,914 --> 00:35:34,948
不!
No!

198
00:35:35,948 --> 00:35:37,784
好吧!听着,听着!
Okay! listen, listen!

199
00:35:37,818 --> 00:35:39,453
不!
No!

200
00:35:39,485 --> 00:35:41,621
从你告诉我你是谁开始。
Let's start with you tellin' me who you are.

201
00:35:41,655 --> 00:35:44,457
我是法律!我是个该死的执法官!
I'm law! i'm a goddamn lawman!

202
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:48,495
他不是执法官，爸，他想杀了我。
He ain't no lawman, pa, he was fixin' to kill me.

203
00:35:48,528 --> 00:35:49,963
想喝点威士忌吗?
Ready for some whisky?

204
00:35:49,996 --> 00:35:52,566
我只是告诉你…我的法律。
I just told you... i'm law.

205
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,369
问问他关于钱的事。
Ask him about the money.

206
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:58,872
什么钱?
What money?

207
00:35:59,606 --> 00:36:00,841
他问我这件事。
He asked me about it.

208
00:36:01,941 --> 00:36:03,776
听。听我的。
Listen. listen to me.

209
00:36:03,809 --> 00:36:04,811
好的,听着。
Okay, listen.

210
00:36:05,979 --> 00:36:07,923
一个开枪的执法官带着一大包现金干什么?
What's a shot lawman doin' with a satchel full of cash?

211
00:36:07,947 --> 00:36:09,682
听!
Listen!

212
00:36:09,715 --> 00:36:11,684
听!如果你有脑子的话，
Listen! if you got a brain in your head,

213
00:36:11,718 --> 00:36:13,553
你得让你自己和你儿子
You need to get yourself and your boy

214
00:36:13,586 --> 00:36:15,021
尽快离开这里。
Out of here fast as you can.

215
00:36:15,055 --> 00:36:16,490
你听到我吗?
You hear me?

216
00:36:21,595 --> 00:36:22,629
不。
No.

217
00:36:22,662 --> 00:36:24,765
哦,不!不,不!
Oh, no! no, no!

218
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,116
至少我们知道你不会死
At least we know you won't die

219
00:36:42,148 --> 00:36:44,451
在我弄清楚我想知道的事情之前。
'fore i find out what i want to know.

220
00:36:51,825 --> 00:36:52,960
哦,上帝。
Oh god.

221
00:36:56,496 --> 00:36:57,831
再来一点。
Let me have a little more.

222
00:36:57,863 --> 00:36:59,932
让我……

00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:04,572
骑手。
Riders.

224
00:37:09,543 --> 00:37:12,579
快点，给我松绑。快点，给我松绑。
Come on, cut me loose. come on, cut me loose.

225
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:17,517
听着，他们会有三个人。
Listen, they gon' be three of 'em.

226
00:37:18,517 --> 00:37:21,421
一个墨西哥。
One's a mexican.

227
00:37:21,454 --> 00:37:23,890
另一个是丑狗娘养的
The other's an ugly son of a bitch

228
00:37:23,923 --> 00:37:25,626
留着浓密的胡子。
With a thick beard.

229
00:37:25,659 --> 00:37:26,794
和他们的领袖……
And their leader...

230
00:37:28,028 --> 00:37:30,173
他们的领导人看起来是一个你不会想惹的人。
Their leader looks like a man you don't want to mess with.

231
00:37:30,197 --> 00:37:32,465
相信我，你不会的。
And believe me, you don't.

232
00:37:32,499 --> 00:37:34,034
不要靠近窗户。
Keep back from the window.

233
00:37:35,535 --> 00:37:37,180
如果你想活命，就得放了我
If you want to live, you gotta turn me loose

234
00:37:37,204 --> 00:37:38,472
把枪给我，听到了吗?
And give me my gun, hear?

235
00:37:39,738 --> 00:37:40,773
他是骗子的。
He's lyin'.

236
00:37:40,807 --> 00:37:42,810
我说了退后。
I said keep back.

237
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:43,911
继续。
Go on.

238
00:38:38,798 --> 00:38:40,100
我能帮你吗?

239
00:38:40,733 --> 00:38:42,268
我是治安官山姆・凯彻姆。
I'm sheriff sam ketchum.

240
00:38:42,302 --> 00:38:44,004
这些是我的副手。

241
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,907
我们一直在寻找一个在逃的人。

242
00:38:46,939 --> 00:38:49,476
最近被称为咖喱。

243
00:38:50,543 --> 00:38:51,845
被枪杀了。

244
00:38:52,711 --> 00:38:56,516
六英尺高，棕色头发，据说很英俊，
Six foot, brown hair, said to be handsome,

245
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:58,051
尽管大多数人想要他的功劳
Though most would want him credited

246
00:38:58,084 --> 00:38:59,153
只为了邪恶。
For nothing but devilry.

247
00:39:01,287 --> 00:39:04,724
我只知道，他很危险。
What i do know is, he's dangerous.

248
00:39:05,224 --> 00:39:07,760
你在这附近见过符合描述的人吗?
You seen anybody around here answers that description?

249
00:39:08,628 --> 00:39:12,131
说你是治安官?我怎么都认不出你了?
Say you're a sheriff? how's it i don't recognize you?

250
00:39:12,731 --> 00:39:14,735
我们是从很远的伍兹郡来的。
We're from way over in woods county.

251
00:39:15,834 --> 00:39:17,145
现在，我们要找的咖喱
Now, this curry we're looking for,

252
00:39:17,169 --> 00:39:18,639
他手上有搜查令
He's got a warrant on him there

253
00:39:18,671 --> 00:39:20,840
在密苏里和田纳西
In missouri and tennessee.

254
00:39:21,707 --> 00:39:24,043
可能还会声称他就是法律。
Might also claim he's the law.

255
00:39:24,744 --> 00:39:26,780
他有过这样的欺骗史。
He's got a history of such chicanery.

256
00:39:27,646 --> 00:39:30,851
远非如此。他是一个杀手。
Far from it. he's a killer.

257
00:39:30,883 --> 00:39:32,619
他还会再杀人。
He will kill again.

258
00:39:35,155 --> 00:39:36,256
你不打算开枪
You're not fixin' to shoot

259
00:39:36,289 --> 00:39:38,057
我们中有谁有枪，是吗?
Any of us with that pistol, are you?

260
00:39:39,726 --> 00:39:41,794
到目前为止我还没理由。
So far i got no reason to.

261
00:39:43,128 --> 00:39:44,130
这是个好消息。
That's good news.

262
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:52,238
在你把那东西举起来之前，你得好好想想，农夫。
You'll want to think 'fore you raise that thing up, farmer.

263
00:39:52,271 --> 00:39:54,674
没什么好担心的，朋友。
Nothing to be worried about here, friend.

264
00:39:54,707 --> 00:39:57,211
只是我在做的一个小项目，仅此而已。
Just a little project i'm working on, that's all.

265
00:39:59,613 --> 00:40:01,181
有多少人住在这里?
How many people live out here?

266
00:40:02,948 --> 00:40:04,351
这和你有什么区别?
What difference is that to you?

267
00:40:04,383 --> 00:40:07,353
我只是想确保你的安全。
I'm trying to make sure you're safe, is all.

268
00:40:07,387 --> 00:40:09,122
不关你的事
Wouldn't seem to be your business,

269
00:40:09,155 --> 00:40:11,758
鉴于你是伍兹郡来的。
Seeing as how you're from woods county.

270
00:40:12,925 --> 00:40:14,927
你结婚了吗?
You married?

271
00:40:14,961 --> 00:40:16,664
看到那边有个坟墓。
Saw a grave over there.

272
00:40:19,064 --> 00:40:20,066
我的妻子。
My wife.

00:40:20,967 --> 00:40:23,970
十年前死于肺结核

我的慰问。
My condolences.

275
00:40:29,675 --> 00:40:31,210
这太可怕了。
Horrible way to go.

276
00:40:31,244 --> 00:40:33,713
告诉他们,爸爸。告诉他们!
Tell 'em, pa. tell 'em!

277
00:40:33,747 --> 00:40:36,250
马克卡迪，玛丽・霍布斯・马克卡迪。
Marie hobbs mccarty, the marker said.

278
00:40:36,983 --> 00:40:39,052
你姓麦卡蒂?
Your last name mccarty?

279
00:40:39,084 --> 00:40:40,119
这是正确的。
That's right.

00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,590
名字吗?

282
00:40:49,996 --> 00:40:51,932
我猜霍布斯是她的人。
So hobbs was her people, i'm guessing.

283
00:40:52,698 --> 00:40:55,302
因为我注意到在东边有个霍布斯农场。
'cause i noticed a hobbs ranch to the east of here.

284
00:40:55,334 --> 00:40:56,603
她的兄弟。
Her brothers.

285
00:40:57,704 --> 00:40:58,738
啊哈。
Uh-huh.

286
00:41:01,006 --> 00:41:02,246
从目前的情况来看
Well, from the looks of things,

287
00:41:02,275 --> 00:41:04,010
你在外面待了好多年了。
You've been out here a good many years.

288
00:41:06,246 --> 00:41:07,615
好的情况。
Nice situation.

289
00:41:08,414 --> 00:41:10,750
都在山上安家。
All nestled up here in the hills.

290
00:41:10,784 --> 00:41:12,218
从远处很难看到。
Hard to see from a distance.

291
00:41:13,419 --> 00:41:16,657
这些和你要找的人有什么关系?
What's any of this got to do with the man you're lookin' for?

292
00:41:17,756 --> 00:41:19,159
没什么，我承认。
Not much, i'll grant you.

293
00:41:22,695 --> 00:41:24,398
很久以前，呃…
Long time ago, uh...

294
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:29,035
有个家伙在新墨西哥的亚利桑那州惹了些麻烦。
Was a fella caused some trouble down arizona, new mexico way.

295
00:41:30,035 --> 00:41:31,838
听说他叫麦卡蒂。
Heard he went by the name mccarty.

296
00:41:33,939 --> 00:41:35,842
我想知道他是不是你的亲戚。
I was wondering if he might be your kin.

297
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:39,313
你抓错猪耳朵了。
You got the wrong pig by the ear.

298
00:41:40,113 --> 00:41:41,014
的意思吗?
Meaning?

299
00:41:41,048 --> 00:41:44,818
除了这里，我哪儿都不认识麦卡锡，
I don't know no mccartys anywhere but here,

300
00:41:44,851 --> 00:41:46,919
我所有的亲人都去世了。
And all my kin is deceased.

301
00:41:48,755 --> 00:41:50,756
现在我要做家务了
Now i got chores to tend to

302
00:41:50,789 --> 00:41:53,392
没有足够的木材来做晚饭。
And scant wood to cook my supper.

303
00:41:53,425 --> 00:41:56,028
我没见过你要找的人。
I ain't seen the man you're after.

304
00:41:56,061 --> 00:41:58,031
我会留意的。
I'll keep my eyes peeled.

305
00:41:58,865 --> 00:42:00,700
一定要通知治安官
Be sure to alert the good sheriff

306
00:42:00,733 --> 00:42:02,936
在切克沙镇
In chickasha if i should run across him.

307
00:42:06,305 --> 00:42:07,307
嗯,然后。
Well, then.

308
00:42:08,742 --> 00:42:09,943
谢谢你的帮助。
I thank you for your help.

309
00:42:12,445 --> 00:42:14,414
看来又是一条死胡同了，伙计们。
Looks like another dead end, boys.

310
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:18,952
今晚你们一定要锁门。
You be sure to lock your doors tonight.

311
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:22,956
保持安全。
Stay safe.

312
00:42:26,825 --> 00:42:27,927
来吧。
Come on.

313
00:42:50,082 --> 00:42:51,851
现在你想留着这个了吗?
Now you're inclined to hang onto that?

314
00:42:51,885 --> 00:42:53,129
我想你可能需要帮助。
I thought you might be needin' help.

315
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:54,921
你想告诉我这是怎么被炒掉的吗?
You wanna tell me how this got fired?

316
00:42:55,854 --> 00:42:57,157
诚实,pa。
Honest, pa.

317
00:42:57,189 --> 00:42:58,325
别对我撒谎!
Don't you lie to me!

318
00:42:59,526 --> 00:43:02,229
我想知道那是什么感觉。
I wanted to know what it's like.

319
00:43:02,262 --> 00:43:07,033
我是50英里内唯一没开过枪的人。
I am the only boy for 50 miles that's never fired one.

320
00:43:07,066 --> 00:43:09,401
你甚至不让我碰你的旧猎枪。
You won't even let me lay hand on your old shotgun.

321
00:43:09,434 --> 00:43:13,105
如果你教不了我，那我就自己来吧。
So if you can't teach me proper, i gotta do it myself.

322
00:43:13,139 --> 00:43:17,477
你再敢碰我的东西，我就打烂你!
You get into my things again, i will crack your crust!

323
00:43:19,211 --> 00:43:22,248
你是个愚蠢无用的老头。
You're a stupid, worthless old man.

324
00:43:22,881 --> 00:43:25,217
一生，却一无所得
A whole life, and nothin' to show for it

325
00:43:25,251 --> 00:43:26,887
但是这个破旧的老农场
But this rundown old farm

326
00:43:26,919 --> 00:43:28,954
还有一个会让你孤独终老的男孩
And a boy who's gonna leave you alone to die

327
00:43:28,988 --> 00:43:30,858
只要他有能力。
As soon as he's able.

328
00:43:43,436 --> 00:43:44,771
让我猜一猜。
Let me guess.

329
00:43:45,238 --> 00:43:46,907
你要告诉我他不是
You gon' tell me that he ain't

330
00:43:46,939 --> 00:43:49,075
你是伍兹县的治安官。
The sheriff of woods county, you are.

331
00:43:49,108 --> 00:43:51,544
他们不是执法者，他们是银行劫匪。
They ain't lawmen, they're bank robbers.

332
00:43:51,577 --> 00:43:53,780
不管怎样，他们还剩下什么。
Well, what's left of them, anyway.

333
00:43:55,914 --> 00:43:59,084
撞翻了亚当斯快车。
Knocked over the adams express.

334
00:43:59,117 --> 00:44:01,153
我和我的副手追了上去，杀了两个
Me and my deputies gave chase, killed two of 'em,

335
00:44:01,186 --> 00:44:02,564
包括拿着赃物的那个。
Including the one carrying the loot.

336
00:44:02,588 --> 00:44:04,523
银行劫匪戴着徽章?
Bank robbers wearin' badges?

337
00:44:04,557 --> 00:44:06,193
他们带走了我和我的人。
That they took off me and my men.

338
00:44:07,193 --> 00:44:08,928
他才是那个冒充法律的人。
He's the one impersonating the law.

339
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:12,332
但你带着钱跑了。
But you made off with the money.

340
00:44:14,267 --> 00:44:15,469
是啊，我抓住了。
Hell, yeah, i grabbed it.

341
00:44:17,202 --> 00:44:20,006
那你为什么不把它带回伍兹郡?
Then why ain't you back with it in woods county?

342
00:44:20,472 --> 00:44:24,076
哦，我不知道。为什么会这样?
Oh, i don't know. why does it look like?

343
00:44:27,213 --> 00:44:28,281
我的首要任务是
And my first priority was

344
00:44:28,314 --> 00:44:30,050
活着离开那群人。
Getting away from that bunch alive.

345
00:44:30,082 --> 00:44:32,122
所以我拼命地骑，直到骑不动为止。
That's why i rode like hell till i couldn't no more.

346
00:44:32,619 --> 00:44:34,153
我记得的最后一件事
There's the last thing i remembered,

347
00:44:34,186 --> 00:44:35,488
直到我在这里醒来
Till i woke up here.

348
00:44:37,456 --> 00:44:38,566
我知道我在说什么
Look, i know what i'm saying

349
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:40,125
听起来很荒谬。
Sounds ridiculous to you and all.

350
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:41,361
它确实是这样。
That it does.

351
00:44:41,394 --> 00:44:42,896
他们为什么不开枪打死你
Why they didn't shoot you dead

352
00:44:42,928 --> 00:44:44,497
我不知道。
On the spot just now, i don't know.

353
00:44:45,497 --> 00:44:47,200
但我可以向你保证…
But i can guarantee you...

354
00:44:48,334 --> 00:44:49,903
他们会回来的。
They'll be back.

355
00:45:44,289 --> 00:45:46,191
只有一件事我想不明白
Only thing i can't figure

356
00:45:46,224 --> 00:45:47,259
为什么是那个老人
Is why the old man

357
00:45:47,293 --> 00:45:49,463
愿意为一个陌生人冒生命危险。
Would risk his neck for a stranger.

358
00:45:50,162 --> 00:45:52,231
也许有人给了他一部分钱。
Maybe he got offered a cut of the money.

359
00:45:53,633 --> 00:45:55,302
直觉告诉我不是这样的。
Something tells me that ain't it.

360
00:45:57,570 --> 00:45:59,439
我们任何人都可以干掉他。
Any one of us could have taken him out.

361
00:46:00,405 --> 00:46:02,241
我们现在就该这么做。
Which is what we should do now.

362
00:46:02,275 --> 00:46:06,113
-骑上去，完成它。-还没呢。
- ride up, finish it. - not just yet.

363
00:46:09,448 --> 00:46:11,651
就因为一个摇摇晃晃的老农民?
'cause of some shaky old farmer?

364
00:46:11,684 --> 00:46:15,421
他拿枪的姿势和我见过的农民都不一样。
He didn't hold that pistol like any farmer i've ever seen.

365
00:46:16,421 --> 00:46:18,190
我们有三个人。
There are three of us.

366
00:46:19,224 --> 00:46:22,394
我们没有在银行里跑，也没有登上舞台
We don't run up in a bank, or ride up on a stage

367
00:46:22,427 --> 00:46:23,930
不知道里面有谁
Without knowing who's in it.

368
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:27,400
我们知道里面有咖喱。用我们的钱!
We know curry's in there. with our money!

369
00:46:27,432 --> 00:46:29,101
所以你才要去侦察
Which is why you're going to reconnoiter

370
00:46:29,135 --> 00:46:31,537
那个所谓的农家
That so-called farmer's place

371
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:33,305
确保咖喱不会跑掉。
And make sure curry don't skedaddle.

372
00:46:33,338 --> 00:46:35,207
很乐意。
Gladly.

373
00:46:36,608 --> 00:46:38,678
在我们到达之前，不要轻举妄动。
Don't make a move till we get there.

374
00:46:40,345 --> 00:46:41,345
很好。
Fine.

375
00:46:42,782 --> 00:46:45,052
――达根。-我说好吧。
- duggan. - i said fine.

376
00:46:53,093 --> 00:46:56,262
日出时，你和我去切克沙镇

377
00:46:56,294 --> 00:46:57,563
雇佣一些枪支。
Hire some guns.

378
00:46:58,363 --> 00:46:59,599
理解。
Understood.

379
00:47:01,133 --> 00:47:05,104
在路上，我们将拜访农夫霍布斯…
On the way, we'll pay a call on farmer hobbs...

380
00:47:05,738 --> 00:47:07,674
看看他有没有什么有趣的消息
Find out if he's got anything interesting

381
00:47:07,706 --> 00:47:10,576
告诉我们关于亨利・麦卡蒂的事
To tell us about ol' henry mccarty.

382
00:48:12,438 --> 00:48:15,175
怀亚特。进来吧。

383
00:48:17,142 --> 00:48:19,512
-我快好了。-留到明天早上吧。

384
00:48:21,847 --> 00:48:22,847
来吧。
Come on.

385
00:48:53,613 --> 00:48:56,582
要是我能自己吃就好了。
It'd be a damn sight easier if i could feed myself.

386
00:48:59,452 --> 00:49:02,222
干脆不给你吃就好了。
Be a damn sight easier not to feed you at all.

387
00:49:18,905 --> 00:49:21,775
-你和我见过吗?-我会记得的。
- you and me ever met? - that i'd remember.

388
00:49:24,644 --> 00:49:26,213
你当警长多久了?

389
00:49:30,383 --> 00:49:35,255
-我想是18年了。-你是怎么开始的?
- i'd say onto 18 years now. - how'd you get your start?

00:49:36,189 --> 00:49:38,191
我是大比尔・汤普森的副手

在巴克斯特弹簧。

393
00:49:45,664 --> 00:49:49,235

- i heard it was a drunk whore. - oh, you did?

一个公寓。在格兰特车站附近。

房东太太叫什么名字?

401
00:50:14,693 --> 00:50:16,529
她不是什么淑女。

就像其他傻瓜一样

梦想着轻松致富，挖锡。

直到我意识到根本没有。

只是一堆关于矿井的鬼故事

我在一个陌生的地方醒来，不知道他是谁……
I woke up in a strange place, didn't know who he was...

418
00:51:26,499 --> 00:51:29,002
我被关在某个藏身处当人质。
I was being held hostage in some hideout.

419
00:51:29,035 --> 00:51:31,371
你觉得这里像是藏身处吗?
This look like a hideout to you?

420
00:51:33,905 --> 00:51:35,909
我无意中听到他早些时候说的话。
I overheard what he said earlier.

421
00:51:36,909 --> 00:51:38,644
他不是那个意思。
He didn't mean any of that.

422
00:51:40,512 --> 00:51:41,614
是的,他做到了。
Yes, he did.

423
00:51:58,097 --> 00:52:02,401
我给你一只手。别逼我把它摘下来。
I'll give you one hand free. don't make me take it off.

424
00:52:02,834 --> 00:52:03,869
好吧。
All right.

425
00:52:09,642 --> 00:52:11,011
好吧。
All right.

426
00:52:30,963 --> 00:52:32,798
你爸爸是种地吗?
Was farming what your daddy did?

427
00:52:33,798 --> 00:52:37,303
我父亲在我三岁的时候去世了，在堪萨斯。
My daddy died when i was 3, up in kansas.

428
00:52:38,104 --> 00:52:40,774
除了种地以外，他几乎什么都做。
And he did near everything but work the land.

429
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:43,976
我15岁就成了孤儿。
I was orphaned at 15.

430
00:52:45,711 --> 00:52:47,981
比我认识我父母的时间长了13年。
That's 13 years longer than i knew my folks.

431
00:52:49,447 --> 00:52:51,817
啊。你在哪长大的?
Ah. whereabouts you grow up?

432
00:52:53,852 --> 00:52:54,854
新墨西哥州。
New mexico.

433
00:52:56,454 --> 00:52:58,490
――这部分?-萨姆纳堡。
- which part? - fort sumner.

434
00:52:58,523 --> 00:53:00,326
出生和长大。你听说过吗?
Born and raised. you heard of it?

435
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:07,499
比利被枪杀的地方，对吧?
Where billy the kid was shot, wasn't it?

436
00:53:09,802 --> 00:53:11,604
人们知道它的主要原因。
Main reason anyone know it.

437
00:53:17,041 --> 00:53:18,877
事发当晚我就在现场。
I was there the night it happened.

438
00:53:22,615 --> 00:53:23,950
这是怎么回事?
How's that?

439
00:53:23,983 --> 00:53:25,985
我当时只是个孩子。
I was just a boy.

440
00:53:26,017 --> 00:53:27,162
我以前能挣多少钱就挣多少钱
I used to make what money i could

441
00:53:27,186 --> 00:53:30,622
帮一个叫彼得・麦克斯韦的人做家务。
Doing chores for a fella by the name of peter maxwell.

442
00:53:31,122 --> 00:53:33,892
那个送孩子过夜的彼得・麦克斯韦尔。
Same peter maxwell put the kid up for the night.

443
00:53:33,925 --> 00:53:35,660
彼得・麦克斯韦向加勒特告密
Same peter maxwell tipped off garrett

444
00:53:35,693 --> 00:53:37,462
他的副手，poe和mckinney
And his deputies, poe and mckinney,

445
00:53:37,496 --> 00:53:39,131
那孩子被关在那里。
The kid was holed up there.

446
00:53:39,164 --> 00:53:40,832
我在扫货摊。
I was sweeping the stalls.

447
00:53:40,865 --> 00:53:43,469
当我看到加勒特走进屋子我…
When i saw garrett walk in the house, i...

448
00:53:44,035 --> 00:53:45,438
我觉得这没什么。
I don't think nothing of it.

449
00:53:46,905 --> 00:53:50,409
但是比利不在里面。不,无论如何。
But billy wasn't in there. not then, leastways.

450
00:53:50,443 --> 00:53:52,445
-知道我是怎么知道的吗?――如何?
- know how i know? - how?

451
00:53:52,477 --> 00:53:54,046
他光着脚，只穿着小腿袖子，
He was barefoot in his shin sleeves,

452
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:55,747
从鹿的尸体上切肉
Cutting the meat off a deer carcass

453
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:57,616
离我工作的地方不到20英尺
Not 20 feet from where i was working.

454
00:54:02,188 --> 00:54:03,956
我看到他从谷仓门往外偷看，
I saw him peer through the barn door,

455
00:54:03,988 --> 00:54:06,392
他看到坡和麦金尼站在门廊上。
And he saw poe and mckinney on the porch there.

456
00:54:07,726 --> 00:54:10,530
他停止雕刻，死死地盯着我的眼睛。
He stopped carving, looked me dead in my eye.

457
00:54:10,563 --> 00:54:14,166
他说:“低头，你会没事的。”
He said, "keep your head down, you'll be all right."

458
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,669
比利直接去了麦克斯韦的房间，
So billy went straight to maxwell's room,

459
00:54:17,702 --> 00:54:20,407
很快发现里面不止是麦克斯韦。
Realized pretty quick it ain't just maxwell in there.

460
00:54:22,073 --> 00:54:25,544
他喊道:“?quien es?”还有谁es ?"
He called out, "?quien es? ?quien es?"

461
00:54:25,577 --> 00:54:27,880
因为比利的西班牙语说得跟墨西哥人一样好。
'cause billy spoke spanish as good as a mexican.

462
00:54:29,048 --> 00:54:30,917
帕特的答案?
Pat's answer?

463
00:54:31,684 --> 00:54:35,955
两个镜头。一个打得很宽，另一个打在胸口。
Two shots. one wide of the mark, and the other one in the chest.

464
00:54:40,659 --> 00:54:42,428
比利这孩子就这样完了。
That was the end of billy the kid.

465
00:54:45,764 --> 00:54:47,633
你看到了这一切。
And you seen it all.

466
00:54:47,666 --> 00:54:49,035
我肯定是这样做的。
I most certainly did.

467
00:54:49,068 --> 00:54:50,870
看到那孩子的尸体也被拖走了，
Saw the kid's body get hauled off too,

468
00:54:50,903 --> 00:54:52,105
裹在血淋淋的床单里。
Wrapped in a bloody sheet.

469
00:54:53,972 --> 00:54:55,907
足以让我明白这不是适合我的生活。
Enough to teach me that ain't no life for me.

470
00:54:55,941 --> 00:54:58,845
我宁愿停止这场疯狂也不愿参与其中。
I'd rather stop this crazy than be part of it anyway.

471
00:55:24,235 --> 00:55:25,637
嗯…
Well...

472
00:55:25,671 --> 00:55:27,173
该死的。
Damn.

473
00:55:27,206 --> 00:55:29,041
如果我知道，只需要一个好故事
If i knew all it took was a good story

474
00:55:29,073 --> 00:55:30,276
让你给我松绑
For you to cut me loose.

475
00:55:33,012 --> 00:55:35,548
你在马鞍上还能站直吗?
You well enough to stay upright in the saddle?

476
00:55:37,615 --> 00:55:39,885
――不是很难。-我要你离开这里。
- not hardly. - i want you out of here.

477
00:55:40,686 --> 00:55:43,122
我想等到天亮也不行吧?
I suppose waiting till sunup ain't an option?

478
00:55:43,155 --> 00:55:45,658
如果我一个人在这里，情况就不一样了。
If i was alone out here, it'd be different.

479
00:55:46,291 --> 00:55:47,893
好吧，我想我准备好了。
Well, then, i guess i'm ready.

480
00:55:50,061 --> 00:55:51,061
好。
Good.

481
00:55:54,767 --> 00:55:55,767
把它。
Take it.

482
00:56:01,573 --> 00:56:02,775
我去拿你的战利品。
I'll fetch your loot.

483
00:56:38,343 --> 00:56:40,146
――爸爸?-怀亚特!下来!
- pa? - wyatt! get down!

484
00:56:43,749 --> 00:56:44,817
我想我没事了。
I-i think i'm all right.

485
00:56:46,952 --> 00:56:47,986
是……他了吗?
Is... is he hit?

486
00:56:55,693 --> 00:56:58,230
他刚刚昏过去了。给我。
He just passed out. give me that.

487
00:56:59,365 --> 00:57:01,100
我比你想的更擅长。
I'm better with it than you think.

488
00:57:01,133 --> 00:57:03,002
等我教你该怎么做。
Not until i teach you proper.

489
00:57:03,035 --> 00:57:04,837
-我自学了-嘘
- i've taught myself - shush.

490
00:57:06,372 --> 00:57:07,840
你去哪了?
Now, where'd you get to?

491
00:57:15,079 --> 00:57:16,615
-他在房子下面。――嘘。
- he's under the house. - shh.

492
00:57:50,282 --> 00:57:52,151
我希望你做得够好。
I hope you got good enough with this.

493
00:57:54,153 --> 00:57:56,255
上帝不允许这种事发生，但射杀一个人
God forbid it happens, but shooting a man

494
00:57:56,287 --> 00:57:58,323
和击中目标是不同的…
Is different than hitting a target...

495
00:57:58,356 --> 00:58:00,793
一条你无法跨越的线。
A line you can't cross back over.

496
00:58:00,825 --> 00:58:01,626
我知道。
I know that.

497
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:03,329
除非你做了，否则你是做不到的。
You couldn't until you've done it.

498
00:58:05,430 --> 00:58:06,798
如果他进来……
If he comes in here...

499
00:58:07,832 --> 00:58:09,101
你扣动扳机。
You pull that trigger.

500
00:58:10,869 --> 00:58:12,238
瞄准胸部。
Aim for the chest.

501
00:58:12,271 --> 00:58:15,173
一直开枪，直到打中为止。
And keep firing until you hit it.

502
00:58:38,764 --> 00:58:40,932
你要去哪里?
Where you going?

503
00:58:55,814 --> 00:58:57,183
婊子养的!
Son of a bitch!

504
00:58:57,816 --> 00:58:58,951
混蛋!
Cocksucker!

505
00:58:59,418 --> 00:59:01,186
他妈的。
Fuck.

506
00:59:08,459 --> 00:59:09,961
大便。
Shit.

507
00:59:38,923 --> 00:59:42,227
其他人在哪里?他们关闭吗?
Where's the others? they close?

508
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:43,496
去地狱。
Go to hell.

509
00:59:44,896 --> 00:59:46,331
我来这里太多次了
I've been here too often to let

510
00:59:46,365 --> 00:59:49,334
像你这样有才干的人检查了我的行李。
A man of your caliber overhaul my baggage.

511
00:59:51,269 --> 00:59:54,072
回答我，否则你就死定了。
Answer me, or it ends for you right now.

512
00:59:55,474 --> 00:59:57,075
去死吧，你这个混蛋。
Go to hell, you bastard.

513
01:00:57,035 --> 01:00:58,871
他想把我们俩都杀了。
He was fixin' to kill us both.

514
01:01:01,472 --> 01:01:02,541
我看到了。
I saw.

515
01:01:03,876 --> 01:01:06,078
可能是来这里看的，然后贪得无厌。
Probably here to watch and got greedy.

516
01:01:07,178 --> 01:01:09,182
其他人会来的。
The others will be coming.

517
01:01:12,383 --> 01:01:14,486
首先，我们得处理掉这具尸体。
First thing, we gotta get rid of this body.

518
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,389
我们要怎么做?
How we gonna do that?

519
01:01:22,494 --> 01:01:23,930
我们不是。
We ain't.

520
01:02:22,521 --> 01:02:24,523
我知道这感觉不像。
I know it don't feel like it.

521
01:02:25,323 --> 01:02:27,425
你很幸运，它只是擦伤了你。
You're lucky it just grazed ya.

522
01:02:31,697 --> 01:02:34,233
如果你知道我找到了那把枪，
If you know i found that gun,

523
01:02:34,265 --> 01:02:36,903
你知道我看到衣柜后面有什么了。
You know i saw what's in the back of that closet.

524
01:02:39,371 --> 01:02:40,371
你是谁?
Who are you?

525
01:02:42,506 --> 01:02:43,642
我就是我。
I'm who i am.

526
01:02:45,242 --> 01:02:48,146
你不是一直在宣扬要诚实吗?
Aren't you always preaching about being honest?

527
01:02:48,713 --> 01:02:50,615
真相会让你自由吗?
The truth will set you free?

528
01:02:53,318 --> 01:02:54,921
我从来没有对你撒过谎。
I've never lied to you.

529
01:03:03,662 --> 01:03:05,297
不是没告诉我真相
Isn't not telling me the whole story

530
01:03:05,329 --> 01:03:06,564
同样的事?
The same damn thing?

531
01:03:12,604 --> 01:03:15,408
我做了一些我希望能收回的事。
I've done things i wish i could take back.

532
01:03:16,307 --> 01:03:19,077
在你之前很久。之前你的马。
A long time before you. before your ma.

533
01:03:20,611 --> 01:03:23,182
你不该听的事。
Things that you got no business hearing.

534
01:03:24,316 --> 01:03:27,453
你都不尊重我，我怎么能尊重你?
How am i supposed to respect you if you ain't respecting me?

535
01:03:27,485 --> 01:03:29,487
我尊重你。
I am respecting you.

536
01:03:30,722 --> 01:03:32,457
如果你不明白，
And if you don't understand that,

537
01:03:32,490 --> 01:03:34,360
我刚才说的话你一个字都没听见。
You ain't heard a word i just said.

538
01:03:35,494 --> 01:03:39,064
不，我听到了。我一点也不相信。
No, i heard it. i just don't believe a bit of it.

539
01:04:16,267 --> 01:04:17,403
保持你的头低着
keep your head down.

540
01:04:21,639 --> 01:04:25,209
低下头。你会没事的。
Keep your head down. you'll be all right.

541
01:04:25,242 --> 01:04:26,277
你会没事的。
you'll be all right.

542
01:06:25,329 --> 01:06:26,764
哇。
Whoa.

543
01:06:34,905 --> 01:06:36,674
-早上好-早上好。
- morning - morning.

544
01:06:37,809 --> 01:06:40,678
-有什么我能帮忙的吗?-我当然希望如此。
- something i can help you with? - i sure hope so.

545
01:06:42,247 --> 01:06:45,851
你这地方真不错。和平的。安静。
Nice place you got here. peaceful. quiet.

546
01:06:48,419 --> 01:06:49,521
鸟打猎。
Bird hunting.

547
01:06:50,454 --> 01:06:52,757
没有什么比这更好的了。
Nothing quite like the flush of the bevy.

548
01:06:54,659 --> 01:06:56,162
你一定很厉害。
You must be quite the shot.

549
01:06:58,563 --> 01:06:59,664
尽我所能。
Do what i can.

550
01:07:00,664 --> 01:07:01,833
我羡慕你。
I envy you.

551
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:04,503
我不能出去打猎
I don't get to go out hunting

552
01:07:04,535 --> 01:07:05,938
尽管我现在很想这么做
As much as i'd like to these days.

553
01:07:07,439 --> 01:07:08,919
有什么能帮你的吗，先生?
Something i can help you with, mister?

554
01:07:11,508 --> 01:07:13,411
我爸爸过去常打野鸡。
My daddy used to hunt pheasant.

555
01:07:13,979 --> 01:07:16,448
我的工作就是把它们清理干净。
It was always my damn job to clean 'em.

556
01:07:18,316 --> 01:07:21,387
切开胸部的皮肤，把它剥掉。
Oh, cutting the skin on the breast, peeling it back.

557
01:07:22,988 --> 01:07:25,424
但久而久之，我发现最好的办法
But over time, i figured the best way

558
01:07:25,456 --> 01:07:27,458
为了去除内脏…
To get rid of their innards...

559
01:07:28,593 --> 01:07:32,464
就是劈开鸟的背用那种方式接近他们。
Was to split the bird's back. get to 'em that way.

560
01:07:35,467 --> 01:07:36,767
这就是你的发现吗?
Is that what you find?

561
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,203
看,我不…
Look, i don't...

562
01:07:38,769 --> 01:07:40,605
我想成为联合国的邻居，但是…
Mean to be un-neighborly, but...

563
01:07:41,006 --> 01:07:43,642
但是说重点?确定。
But get to the point? sure.

564
01:07:45,876 --> 01:07:47,979
我想问你几个问题，关于，
I wanted to ask you a couple questions about, uh,

565
01:07:48,012 --> 01:07:49,914
你的妹夫。
Your brother-in-law.

566
01:07:51,582 --> 01:07:53,351
他跟你有什么关系?
Well, what concern is he of yours?

567
01:07:54,485 --> 01:07:56,221
这正是我想弄明白的。
That's what i'm trying to figure out.

568
01:07:57,354 --> 01:07:59,457
我有个疯狂的想法…
You see, i got this crazy idea...

569
01:08:00,457 --> 01:08:01,860
也许麦克卡迪还有更多
There might be more to ol' mccarty

570
01:08:01,892 --> 01:08:02,892
一眼就能看出来。
Than meets the eye.

571
01:08:03,996 --> 01:08:05,916
你是什么执法官之类的吗?
You supposed be some kind of lawman or something?

572
01:08:06,564 --> 01:08:08,300
就像这样。
Something like that.

573
01:08:09,367 --> 01:08:10,970
我觉得你该走了。
Well, i think it's time you left.

574
01:08:11,735 --> 01:08:13,771
我们是来找答案的。
Well, we came here for some answers.

575
01:08:15,807 --> 01:08:17,876
不抓到他们，我们不走。
We ain't leaving till i get 'em.

576
01:08:17,909 --> 01:08:19,245
这样吗?
That so?

577
01:08:23,881 --> 01:08:25,517
我应该……
I should...

578
01:08:30,054 --> 01:08:33,291
现在我们要怎么把他抬起来?
Now how the hell we gonna pick his ass up?

579
01:08:42,733 --> 01:08:45,903
好吧。好的,谢谢你。
Okay. okay, thank you.

580
01:09:00,384 --> 01:09:02,486
哦,上帝。好吧。
Oh, god. okay.

581
01:09:02,519 --> 01:09:06,057
我不适合旅行。我不是。
I'm no good to travel. i'm not.

582
01:09:07,726 --> 01:09:09,428
你带着孩子离开这里。
You take the boy, you get out of here.

583
01:09:10,661 --> 01:09:11,838
凯彻姆和他的人到达时，
When ketchum and his men arrive,

584
01:09:11,862 --> 01:09:13,499
我会尽量拖住他们。
I'll hold them off as long as i can.

585
01:09:14,398 --> 01:09:16,035
-去他的!-怀亚特。
- the hell with that! - wyatt.

586
01:09:17,035 --> 01:09:18,671
我们有枪。
We got guns.

587
01:09:19,403 --> 01:09:21,473
你已经赤手空拳杀了一个了。
You already killed one of them barehanded.

588
01:09:21,505 --> 01:09:24,375
填满一个包。我们离开。
Fill a pack. we're leaving.

589
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:27,579
我警告你。
I'm warning you.

590
01:09:55,005 --> 01:09:56,508
他回来了。
He's back.

591
01:10:06,550 --> 01:10:07,384
离开休息。
Leave the rest.

592
01:10:07,419 --> 01:10:09,521
我们不能让他在这里等死。
We can't just leave him here to die.

593
01:10:09,554 --> 01:10:10,856
我绝对不会失去你的
I am damn sure not gonna lose you

594
01:10:10,888 --> 01:10:12,656
和我们无关的事。
Over something that ain't our fight.

595
01:10:12,689 --> 01:10:13,892
你爸是对的。
Your pa's right.

596
01:10:13,924 --> 01:10:15,826
我已经长大了，可以自己做决定了，
I am old enough to make my own decisions,

597
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:17,829
不管你是否准备好接受这个事实。
Whether you are ready to accept that or not.

598
01:10:17,862 --> 01:10:20,565
是的。这是我来完成的。
Yeah. this is mine to finish.

599
01:10:20,598 --> 01:10:22,034
继续,现在。我会没事的。
Go on, now. i'll be all right.

600
01:10:54,531 --> 01:10:55,531
哇。
Whoa.

601
01:10:59,170 --> 01:11:02,640
咖喱!有人在家吗?
Curry! anybody home?

602
01:11:04,075 --> 01:11:06,077
你们需要什么吗?
You gentlemen need something?

603
01:11:07,077 --> 01:11:08,914
我们是来抓逃犯的。
We're here for our fugitive.

604
01:11:09,546 --> 01:11:11,784
我昨天告诉过你我没见过他。
I told you yesterday i ain't seen him.

605
01:11:12,983 --> 01:11:15,653
我的直觉告诉我那不是真的。
My intuition tells me that's not true.

606
01:11:17,088 --> 01:11:18,790
我就直说了…
I'll make it easy...

607
01:11:18,822 --> 01:11:21,927
你把他交出来，我们就放了你和那孩子。
You hand him over, we let you and the boy go free.

608
01:11:23,193 --> 01:11:26,531
另一个选择是，我们带走他。
The other option is, we take him.

609
01:11:26,563 --> 01:11:28,133
然后你和那孩子就会死。
And you and the boy die.

610
01:11:29,567 --> 01:11:31,636
你接受这个条件。
You take that deal.

611
01:11:31,669 --> 01:11:33,572
这是我自愿的，你不是。
I signed up for this, you didn't.

612
01:11:38,242 --> 01:11:40,611
看，你的马已经备好了。
See your horses are already saddled.

613
01:11:40,644 --> 01:11:42,848
你可以走了。
You can just ride on out of here.

614
01:11:47,852 --> 01:11:49,621
你我都知道我们会死的
You and i both know we'll be dead

615
01:11:49,653 --> 01:11:50,988
在我们上马之前。
Before we mount our horses.

616
01:11:54,224 --> 01:11:57,562
如果这变成了某种brigasee
'fore this turns into some kinda brigasee,

617
01:11:57,594 --> 01:11:59,798
不如我们来解决这个问题，
Why don't me and you settle this,

618
01:11:59,830 --> 01:12:01,098
关节和头骨。
Knuckle and skull.

619
01:12:04,001 --> 01:12:06,205
作为一个农民，你经历了很多争斗。
You got a lot of fight for a farmer.

620
01:12:07,272 --> 01:12:09,140
事情不是这样的。
That ain't the way this plays out.

621
01:12:11,209 --> 01:12:12,478
带给他!
Bring him up!

622
01:12:25,089 --> 01:12:26,158
艾尔?
Al?

623
01:12:52,183 --> 01:12:54,052
听我的。会发生什么
Listen to me. what's gonna happen

624
01:12:54,085 --> 01:12:55,220
将很快发生。
Will happen quick.

625
01:12:55,253 --> 01:12:58,255
我会尽量拖延，但我希望你从后面溜出去
I'll stall long as i can, but i want you to sneak out back

626
01:12:58,289 --> 01:13:00,125
躲在罗杰的磨坊里
And hole up at roger's mill...

627
01:13:00,157 --> 01:13:01,660
在那里等我。
And wait for me there.

628
01:13:02,059 --> 01:13:04,094
只有在必要时才使用这个。
Only use this if you have to.

629
01:13:04,128 --> 01:13:06,164
-让我来打。-我做不好
- let me fight. - i can't do this right

630
01:13:06,196 --> 01:13:07,998
如果我担心保护你
If i'm worried about protecting you.

631
01:13:08,031 --> 01:13:09,634
把我翻过来。
Just turn me over.

632
01:13:10,602 --> 01:13:12,571
你不去，他们会把我们都杀了。
You don't, they're gonna kill us all.

633
01:13:12,603 --> 01:13:13,371
你我都知道
You and me both know

634
01:13:13,405 --> 01:13:15,005
反正他们也要这么做。
They're fixin' to do that anyway.

635
01:13:15,039 --> 01:13:17,643
你还想让我跑出去面对枪林弹雨?
And yet you expect me to run out into sure gunfire?

636
01:13:18,076 --> 01:13:19,177
你儿子是对的。
Your boy's right.

637
01:13:25,116 --> 01:13:26,618
呆在室内。
Stay inside.

638
01:13:26,651 --> 01:13:28,687
离窗户远点。
Stay away from the window.

639
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:31,222
你必须射击，瞄准胸部，然后…
You have to shoot, aim for the chest, and...

640
01:13:31,254 --> 01:13:32,957
继续开枪，直到我打中什么。
Keep firing till i hit something.

641
01:13:50,974 --> 01:13:52,177
我有些怀疑
I've had some suspicions

642
01:13:52,210 --> 01:13:54,580
你是谁，亨利・麦卡蒂
About who you are, henry mccarty.

643
01:13:57,080 --> 01:14:01,586
我得承认，这名字就像刺一样刺进了我的心。
I got to admit, that name sticks in me like a thorn.

644
01:14:01,986 --> 01:14:04,256
我的好奇心被激起了。
My curiosity was aroused.

645
01:14:05,756 --> 01:14:08,259
我希望艾尔能给我点启示。
I was hoping al here might shed some light.

646
01:14:09,994 --> 01:14:11,830
他什么都不会说。
He wouldn't say shit.

647
01:14:12,830 --> 01:14:14,933
即使在我的孩子们…
Even after my boys were...

648
01:14:14,965 --> 01:14:18,769
这个词是什么?在他们的问题中强调。
What's the word? uh, emphatic in their question.

649
01:14:21,004 --> 01:14:23,074
你可能认为我不是治安官。
You probably concluded i'm no sheriff.

650
01:14:24,008 --> 01:14:26,010
这些人也不是我的副手。
Nor are these men my deputies.

651
01:14:27,077 --> 01:14:28,847
我们中没有一个人花时间
Not a one of us had spent time

652
01:14:28,879 --> 01:14:31,015
一个月前在伍兹郡。
In woods county before a month ago.

653
01:14:32,416 --> 01:14:33,619
你呢?
What about you?

654
01:14:35,018 --> 01:14:36,354
你从哪里来?
Where'd you come from?

655
01:14:37,421 --> 01:14:39,924
除了这里，地球上的每一个地方。
Every place on earth but this.

656
01:14:42,826 --> 01:14:44,094
所以要它。
So be it.

657
01:14:44,128 --> 01:14:45,296
最后的报价。
Last offer.

658
01:14:47,165 --> 01:14:48,900
这个张口结舌的混蛋
This tongue-tied piece of shit

659
01:14:48,933 --> 01:14:50,769
为了警长咖喱和钱。
For sheriff curry in there and the money.

660
01:14:51,268 --> 01:14:52,704
你得到了你想要的。
You get what you want.

661
01:14:53,103 --> 01:14:54,305
我得到了我想要的。
I get what i want.

662
01:14:54,972 --> 01:14:57,942
我们各走各的路，不流血。
We go our separate ways without blood spilled.

663
01:14:58,976 --> 01:15:01,713
不是你的，也不是我的。
Not yours, not mine.

664
01:15:02,245 --> 01:15:04,148
不是你那个监视我的孩子
Not that boy of yours i see surveilling

665
01:15:04,182 --> 01:15:05,751
所有这些都通过那扇窗户。
All this through that window.

666
01:15:08,018 --> 01:15:09,186
如果我想要流血
If i wanted bloodshed,

667
01:15:09,219 --> 01:15:12,156
我很久以前就会冲进去开枪了。
I'd have busted in there guns a-blazin' a long time ago.

668
01:15:13,491 --> 01:15:15,127
我相信你知道的。
I believe you know that.

669
01:15:15,860 --> 01:15:18,863
你把我姐夫留在原地。
You leave my brother-in-law right where he is.

670
01:15:19,731 --> 01:15:22,901
滚出我的地盘。
Turn and ride your asses off my property.

671
01:15:22,933 --> 01:15:26,137
你这么做，我就饶你一命。
You do that, and i'll let you live.

672
01:15:30,474 --> 01:15:32,376
听到了吗，伙计们?
You hear that, fellas?

673
01:15:32,410 --> 01:15:35,046
这是一个温和的乡巴佬说的吗?
Is that the talk of a mild old sodbuster?

674
01:15:35,079 --> 01:15:37,081
我认为不是。
I think not.

675
01:15:38,348 --> 01:15:39,351
不。
Nah.

676
01:15:40,285 --> 01:15:42,688
这听起来完全是另一回事。
That sounds like something else altogether.

677
01:15:44,187 --> 01:15:45,187
霍布斯!
Hobbs!

678
01:15:46,290 --> 01:15:49,093
你能告诉我任何可能改变局面的事吗?
Anything you could tell me might change the equation here?

679
01:15:52,229 --> 01:15:55,467
去你的，你个长篇大论的混蛋。
Kiss my ass, you long-winded son of a bitch.

680
01:15:58,803 --> 01:16:01,773
你有一双，我承认。
You got a pair, i'll give you that.

681
01:16:05,375 --> 01:16:06,811
最后机会。
Last chance, al.

682
01:16:10,214 --> 01:16:15,954
你不知道你要释放的地狱风暴。
You have no idea the hell storm you fixin' to let loose.

683
01:16:18,990 --> 01:16:20,992
我已经被警告过了。
Consider me properly warned.

684
01:16:27,799 --> 01:16:30,402
一件容易的事。哇。
Easy. whoa.

685
01:16:33,870 --> 01:16:35,005
容易,伙计。
Easy, fella.

686
01:16:42,412 --> 01:16:44,950
该死的。
Goddamn.

687
01:16:46,317 --> 01:16:47,419
看看这个。
Look at that.

688
01:16:48,419 --> 01:16:50,121
我想说她玩完了。
I'd say she's done.

689
01:16:50,153 --> 01:16:52,156
这难道不是一件美好的事情吗?
Ain't that a thing of beauty?

690
01:16:59,563 --> 01:17:00,563
怀亚特!
Wyatt!

691
01:17:05,570 --> 01:17:06,772
进入!
Get in!

692
01:17:16,914 --> 01:17:17,916
你还在吗?
You still with us?

693
01:17:18,249 --> 01:17:20,485
我的少。
Less of me.

694
01:17:21,919 --> 01:17:23,889
哇。哇。
Whoa. whoa.

695
01:17:30,161 --> 01:17:31,163
马克卡迪!
Mccarty!

696
01:17:33,330 --> 01:17:35,065
你死了吗?
You dead yet?

697
01:17:35,866 --> 01:17:37,134
我当然不是。
I sure ain't.

698
01:17:37,168 --> 01:17:38,969
我假设我没见过
I'm assuming the fact i ain't seen

699
01:17:39,003 --> 01:17:41,272
今天早上我的朋友达根
My man duggan this morning

700
01:17:41,304 --> 01:17:44,075
说明他肯定和你有过交集，
Means he must have crossed paths with you,

701
01:17:44,107 --> 01:17:45,943
事情并没有如他所愿。
And things didn't go his way.

702
01:17:48,345 --> 01:17:51,950
鉴于我刚刚杀了你的人，
Seeing as how i just killed your man al here,

703
01:17:51,982 --> 01:17:53,485
我想说这对我们来说是正确的。
I'd say that squares us.

704
01:17:54,585 --> 01:17:56,120
没有更多的游戏。
No more games.

705
01:17:56,152 --> 01:17:58,823
给你一分钟时间出来。
You got one minute to come out.

706
01:18:00,457 --> 01:18:02,393
你差点害死我们俩
You nearly got us both killed,

707
01:18:02,425 --> 01:18:04,294
是关于你的眼泪和愤怒吗
Which is about all your tears and rage

708
01:18:04,327 --> 01:18:05,463
相当于。
Would have amounted to.

709
01:18:07,932 --> 01:18:11,402
现在把头低下。你会没事的。
Now keep your damn head down. you'll be all right.

710
01:18:18,241 --> 01:18:19,543
保持你的头低，
keep your head down,

711
01:18:19,576 --> 01:18:21,178
你会没事的
you'll be all right.

712
01:18:28,385 --> 01:18:30,388
坡和麦金尼站在门廊上。
Poe and mckinney were on the porch.

713
01:18:32,223 --> 01:18:33,425
加勒特进了房子
Garrett went in the house.

714
01:18:40,497 --> 01:18:43,101
两枪……但他……
Two shots... but he...

715
01:18:44,201 --> 01:18:48,240
你跟他们说西班牙语。
And you were speaking spanish to 'em.

716
01:18:51,675 --> 01:18:53,210
但他没杀你。
But he didn't kill you.

717
01:18:54,010 --> 01:18:55,647
他帮你逃跑了。
He helped you escape.

718
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:58,349
你是他。
You're him.

719
01:19:01,285 --> 01:19:02,487
他是谁?
He's who?

720
01:19:05,121 --> 01:19:06,323
邦尼。
Bonney.

721
01:19:07,525 --> 01:19:09,027
爸，他在说什么?
Pa, what is he talking about?

722
01:19:19,036 --> 01:19:21,139
爸爸!
Pa!

723
01:19:28,179 --> 01:19:29,981
聪明的选择,朋友。
Smart choice, friend.

724
01:19:42,593 --> 01:19:43,595
他说了什么?
What's he saying?

725
01:20:20,031 --> 01:20:23,068
你敢走出去。
Don't you dare step outside.

726
01:22:36,433 --> 01:22:37,469
啊。
Ah.

727
01:22:40,470 --> 01:22:42,107
啊!
Aah!

728
01:24:25,976 --> 01:24:28,213
他妈的。
Fuck.

729
01:26:54,857 --> 01:26:55,892
你对吧?
You all right?

730
01:27:15,912 --> 01:27:16,914
哦。
Oh.

731
01:27:20,951 --> 01:27:24,822
怀亚特。去拿一桶水和一些破布来。
Wyatt. fetch a pail of water and some rags.

732
01:27:24,854 --> 01:27:25,854
继续。
Go on.

733
01:27:33,729 --> 01:27:36,500
你肯定有过好日子。
You've certainly seen better days.

734
01:27:36,532 --> 01:27:38,402
我就知道你很面熟。
I knew you had a familiar face.

735
01:27:39,236 --> 01:27:41,671
一开始我就是想不起来是什么。
I just couldn't place it at first.

736
01:27:42,572 --> 01:27:44,874
我们去找医生。
We'll get the doc.

737
01:27:44,907 --> 01:27:47,144
首先我得减缓出血。
First i gotta slow the bleed.

738
01:27:48,245 --> 01:27:50,648
这么多年来你是怎么藏起来的?
How you manage to stay hidden all these years?

739
01:27:51,814 --> 01:27:53,884
把你的衣服脱下来。
Let's get some of this shirt off you.

740
01:27:53,916 --> 01:27:55,820
我可以用它绑住这条腿。
I can use it to tie off this leg.

741
01:28:33,189 --> 01:28:34,459
哦,狗屎。
Well, shit.

742
01:28:35,692 --> 01:28:37,462
我真希望你没看到。
I wish you didn't see that.

743
01:28:43,866 --> 01:28:46,870
就像我之前听到你告诉你儿子的一样。
It's just like i heard you tell your boy before.

744
01:28:47,704 --> 01:28:51,843
我不是撒谎了吗，我只是没告诉你全部真相。
Ain't that i lied, i just never told you the whole truth.

745
01:28:53,076 --> 01:28:55,246
你是法律吗?
Was you law at all?

746
01:28:55,278 --> 01:28:57,781
伍兹县治安官，就像我说的。
Sheriff of woods county, just like i said.

747
01:28:59,148 --> 01:29:00,150
我和我的副手们
Me and my deputies,

748
01:29:00,183 --> 01:29:02,719
我们在春天就和凯彻姆签约了。
We signed on with ketchum back in the spring.

749
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:05,689
我们必须占领他们的品牌。
We had to take their brand.

750
01:29:07,124 --> 01:29:08,592
跟他们干过几次。
Done a few jobs with 'em.

751
01:29:08,625 --> 01:29:10,060
但我们发现他们在计划
But we figured out they was planning

752
01:29:10,093 --> 01:29:11,629
在最后一次行动时干掉我们。
To gun us down on this last go.

753
01:29:13,296 --> 01:29:15,265
所以我们想抢在他们前面。
So we tried to beat 'em to the punch.

754
01:29:15,299 --> 01:29:17,768
跑掉了，他们从远处把我插了进去。
Took off, and they plugged me from a distance.

755
01:29:20,036 --> 01:29:22,106
他们会追杀我到天涯海角。
They'd have hunted me to the end of the earth.

756
01:29:24,308 --> 01:29:26,043
很抱歉我来了这里。
I'm sorry i ended up here.

757
01:29:27,978 --> 01:29:30,181
我最不想让你知道的就是真相。
Last thing i wanted, you wanna know the truth of it.

758
01:29:32,715 --> 01:29:34,155
因为你那时对我很好。
'cause you were good to me back then.

759
01:29:35,018 --> 01:29:36,020
嗯。
Huh.

760
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:39,120
我永远不能容忍你做了他们说的那些事。
I could never square you done the things they said.

761
01:29:40,357 --> 01:29:42,927
虽然我现在相信了。
Though i sure as hell can believe it now.

762
01:29:52,902 --> 01:29:54,838
我都不记得你了。
I don't even remember you.

763
01:29:55,938 --> 01:29:59,175
你为什么要这么做?我只是个农场工人。
Well, why would you? i was just a ranch hand.

764
01:30:00,911 --> 01:30:03,147
现在是我杀了比利这个孩子。
Now i get to be the man who killed billy the kid.

765
01:30:17,361 --> 01:30:19,229
-你坚持住，我去叫医生。――没有。
- you hold on, i'll get the doc. - no.

766
01:30:21,164 --> 01:30:22,198
Pa。
Pa.

767
01:30:22,232 --> 01:30:24,569
我能走到这一步真是奇迹。
It's a miracle i made it this far.

768
01:30:27,903 --> 01:30:29,240
一旦这件事传出去…
Once this gets out...

769
01:30:30,674 --> 01:30:33,611
你会听到一些关于我的事。
You gonna hear some things about me.

770
01:30:33,643 --> 01:30:34,978
有些是真的。
Some of it's true.

771
01:30:36,045 --> 01:30:37,347
很多都不是。
A lot of it ain't.

772
01:30:39,015 --> 01:30:41,251
事实是……
Fact is...

773
01:30:42,385 --> 01:30:45,923
我都不知道我以前是谁了。
I don't even know who or what i was anymore.

774
01:30:47,323 --> 01:30:51,262
我不相信救赎。
I don't believe in redemption.

775
01:30:53,362 --> 01:30:56,032
但男人可以找到某种慰藉…
But a man can find some kind of solace...

776
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,269
如果他有像你这样的儿子要抚养。
If he's got a boy like you to raise.

777
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:04,875
世界在变化。
The world is changing.

778
01:31:07,009 --> 01:31:08,278
你去看吧。
You go see it.

779
01:31:09,979 --> 01:31:12,750
我再也不属于那个地方了。
It's a place i don't belong in no more.

780
01:31:16,385 --> 01:31:18,022
我希望……
I'm hoping...

781
01:31:19,289 --> 01:31:20,724
你做的事情。
You do.

782
01:31:31,168 --> 01:31:32,637
爸爸?
Pa?

783
01:31:33,903 --> 01:31:35,039
爸爸?
Pa?

784
01:33:16,138 --> 01:33:17,407
来吧。
Come on.
