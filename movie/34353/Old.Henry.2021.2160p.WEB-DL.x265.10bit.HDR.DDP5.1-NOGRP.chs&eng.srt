{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Yeah, I'll go saddle up.

101
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:48,200
你看好这匹马 待在里面等我回来
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You tend to this horse and stay inside till I get back.

102
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,980
但如果有麻烦呢 爸爸? 我可以帮你
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}But what if it's trouble, pa? I can help you.

103
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,060
继续 照我说的做
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Go on. Do as I say.

104
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,860
喂
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Hello.

105
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:56,960
不好
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Nope.

106
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,310
怀亚特
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Wyatt!

107
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,060
- 他还活着吗?  - 还有口气
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}- Is he alive?  - Barely.

108
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,480
他一个人吗?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Was he alone?

109
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,040
是的 但那里还有其他人的踪迹
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}No, but I dispatched with a dozen others was there.

110
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,300
帮我一把
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Give me a hand.

111
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,040
他... 他失血过多
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}He's... he's lost a lot of blood.

112
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,760
他还能活吗?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Is he gonna live?

113
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,080
我想取决于我们
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Be up to us, I suppose.

114
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,260
现在太晚路又远 没法去找医生
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Too far and too late to fetch the doc.

115
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,540
我去 如果必要 可以连夜赶路
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Well, I can go. Ride all night if I have to.

116
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,880
我相信你可以
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I'm sure you would.

117
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,800
所以?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}So?

118
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,900
你就呆在这里 把那瓶金缕梅给我
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You'll stay right here. Hand over that witch Hazel.

119
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,540
他是个亡命徒
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}That is an outlaw.

120
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,360
在奔跑中摔下了马
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}On the run, shot off his horse.

121
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,580
你觉得他杀过人吗?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You think he killed somebody?

122
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,480
怀亚特 我知道的跟你一样多
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Wyatt, I know just as much as you do.

123
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,560
那是做什么?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}What's that for?

124
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,940
把伤口扎紧 以免他夜里失血太多
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Seal the wound tight so he don't bleed out overnight.

125
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,960
不 胸部受伤千万别抬高双脚
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}No! Don't never elevate the feet with a chest wound.

126
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,900
我看到了你身上的伤疤
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I've seen the scars on your body.

127
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,940
因为我没有对你隐瞒
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}'Cause I ain't hid'em from you.

128
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,240
现在也许你明白你的成长经历了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Now maybe you'll understand your raisin'.

129
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,030
来压住这里
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Put your hand right here.

130
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,840
你要去哪里?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Where you goin'?

131
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,220
在我回来前一直压着
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Just keep applyin' pressure till I get back.

132
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:41,860
现在做什么?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}What now?

133
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,500
子弹必须出来 不然他会死
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Bullet's gotta come out. And he won't make the ride.

134
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,260
分开绳子
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Half that rope.

135
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,480
我去找医生
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I'll fetch the doc.

136
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,940
你留在这里看着他
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You'll stay here and keep an eye on him.

137
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,120
你真的觉得有必要吗?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You really think that's necessary?

138
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,110
有必要
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}It ain't not necessary.

139
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,150
你为什么不冷静下来
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Now, why don't you cool his fever

140
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,740
而不是为你
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}instead of vaporizin' on every

141
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,550
脑子里的想法感到自豪?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}thought that comes into your head?

142
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,020
没有痕迹
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Trail's cold.

143
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,520
我们会抓住他
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}We'll get him.

144
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,220
那家伙能在水中追踪鱼
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}That dog could track a fish through water.

145
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,780
走吧
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Come on.

146
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,260
如果他醒了 你要保持距离
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}He should come to, you keep your distance.

147
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,910
没事 他被绑住了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}It don't matter he's tied up.

148
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,640
我自己能处理
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I can handle myself.

149
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:55,180
照我说的做 我会尽快回来
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You just do as I say. I'll be back soon as I can.

150
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,060
走吧
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Come on.

151
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,520
比利在哪里?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Where's Billy at?

152
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,200
{\pos(192,270)\c&HFFFFFF&}是谁?

153
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,180
{\i1}低下头 你会没事的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Keep your head down. You'll be all right.

154
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,220
哇
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Whoa.

155
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,160
他来过这里
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}He was here.

156
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,540
我不这么认为
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Don't look like it to me.

157
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,340
如果我没猜错 他不是一个人
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}If I'm right, he weren't alone.

158
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,740
不管是谁都知道他做了什么
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Whoever it is knows what he's doin'.

159
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,220
他像其他人一样很好的掩盖了行踪
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Covered his tracks as good as anyone I've run across.

160
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,480
要不是这场雨 我早就找到他了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Weren't for this rain, I'd have found him sooner.

161
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,740
我不需要听你那愚蠢的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I don't need you to speechify the inner workings

162
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,090
狗脑子是如何推测的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}in your halfwit canine mind.

163
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,860
我只想知道他在哪里
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I need to know where he's headed.

164
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,340
嗯 这并不能缩小搜索范围
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Well, that don't exactly narrow it down.

165
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,000
我在哪里?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Where am I?

166
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,600
你到底是谁?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Who the hell are you?

167
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,500
我爸爸发现你 快死了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}M-My pa found you, close to dead.

168
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,800
他把你带回来了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}He brought you back here.

169
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,060
噢 是吗?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Oh, yeah?

170
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,580
你爸爸是谁?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Who's your pa?

171
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,280
普通人 呃...
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Nobody. Uh...

172
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,580
亨利 就是个农民
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Henry. Just a-a farmer.

173
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,160
什么 这里只有你和他?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}What, it's only you and him here?

174

他现在在吗?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}He here now?

175
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,980
他就在后面
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}He's just out back.

176
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,680
在喂猪
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Tendin' to the hogs.

177
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,060
噢 是吗?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Oh, yeah?

178
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,840
好吧 去叫他来
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Well, go fetch him.

179

180
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,440

181
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,300
我不想伤害你 别动
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I don't want to hurt you. Stop moving!

182
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:36,460
你把我的枪和包放哪儿了? 听我说
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Where'd you put my gun and my satchel? Listen to me!

183
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,800
我不知道你在说什么 先生
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I don't know what you're talkin' about, mister.

184
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,820
别骗我
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Don't you lie to me!

185
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:42,120
你拿我的枪和包做什么?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}What'd you do with my gun and my satchel?

186
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,280
爸爸
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Pa!

187
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,600
他是怎么逃脱的?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}How'd he get loose?

188
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:18,780
他扭动着挣脱了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}H-He wriggled free.

189
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,500

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Wriggled free?

190
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:24,040
他拿到我留在床头柜上的刀了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}And got hold of my knife I left on the bedstand.

191
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,780
我们两个都有责任
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Well, that's on the both of us.

192
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,480
帮我把这混蛋绑起来
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Help me tie the son of a bitch back up.

00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,910
好吧
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Okay.

194
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:05,380
你最好仔细想想你自己惹的麻烦
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You better think long and hard on what you got yourself into.

195
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,650
有趣 我正要对你说同样的话
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Funny, I was about to tell you the same thing.

196
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:12,920
你想拿它做什么?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}What you aimin' to do with that?

197
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,180
把你身上的子弹取出来
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Gonna dig that bullet out of you,

198
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,860
也许在这过程中会得到些答案
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}maybe get some answers in the process.

199
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,820
听到我想听的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I like what I hear,

200
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,240
我也许会给你点减轻痛苦的东西
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I might be inclined to give you something to ease the pain.

201
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:30,940
不
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}No.

202
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,160
不
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}No!

203
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,780
好吧 听着 听着
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Okay! Listen, listen!

204
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,450
不
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}No!

205
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,960
从你告诉我你是谁开始
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Let's start with you tellin' me who you are.

206
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,340
我是执法人员 是个警察
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I'm law! I'm a goddamn lawman!

207
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,320
他不是警察 爸爸 他想杀了我
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}He ain't no lawman, pa, he was fixin' to kill me.

208
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,100
想喝点威士忌吗?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Ready for some whisky?

209
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,460
我说了... 我是执法人员
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I just told you... I'm law.

210
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,920
问他钱的事
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Ask him about the money.

211
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:58,500
什么钱?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}What money?

212
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,700
他问过我这个
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}He asked me about it.

213
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,720
听着 听我说
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Listen. Listen to me.

214
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,810
好把 听着
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Okay, listen.

215
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,000
一个拿着满满一包现金的警察在干什么?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}What's a shot lawman doin' with a satchel full of cash?

216
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,860
听着
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Listen!

217
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,740
听着 如果你还有脑子
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Listen! If you got a brain in your head,

218
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,640
你就必须带上你的孩子
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}you need to get yourself and your boy

219
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,120
尽快离开这里
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}out of here fast as you can.

220
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,340
听到了吗?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You hear me?

221
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,740
不
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}No.

222
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,720
噢 不 不 不
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Oh, no! No, no!

223
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,180
至少在我找到想知道的之前
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}At least we know you won't die

224
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,300
你一时还死不了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}'fore I find out what I want to know.

225
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,760
噢 上帝
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Oh god.

226
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,580
给我再喝点
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Let me have a little more.

227
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,900
让我...
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Let me...

228
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:04,920
有骑手
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Riders.

229
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,570
拜托 放开我 快 放开我
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Come on, cut me loose. Come on, cut me loose.

230
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,880
听着 他们可能有三个人
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Listen, they gon' be three of'em.

231
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,840
一个是墨西哥人
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}One's a Mexican.

232
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,500
另一个是留着大胡子的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}The other's an ugly son of a bitch

233
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,000
丑八怪
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}with a thick beard.

234
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,790
而他们的头...
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}And their leader...

235
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,760
他们的老大看起来是个你不想惹的人
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Their leader looks like a man you don't want to mess with.

236
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:32,220
相信我 你不会想惹
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}And believe me, you don't.

237
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,030
不要靠近窗户
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Keep back from the window.

238
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,600
如果你们想活命 就放开我
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}If you want to live, you gotta turn me loose

239
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,820
把枪给我 听到了吗?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}and give me my gun, hear?

240
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,770
他在撒谎
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}He's lyin'.

241
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,200
我说了退后
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I said keep back.

242
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,760
照做
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Go on.

243
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,720
我能帮你们吗?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Can I help you?

244
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,280
我是萨姆・凯彻姆警长
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I'm sheriff Sam ketchum.

245
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,900
他们是我的副手
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}These here are my deputies.

246
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,000
我们一直在追踪一个逃犯
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}We've been scoutin' for a man on the run.

247
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,300
他最近自称叫柯里
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Lately goes by the name of curry.

248
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,520
被击伤了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Been shot.

249
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,700
六英尺高 棕色头发 据说很帅
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Six foot, brown hair, said to be handsome,

250
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,140
尽管大多数人都觉得他只是个小混混
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}though most would want him credited for nothing but devilry.

251
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:04,140
但我知道 他很危险
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}What I do know is, he's dangerous.

252
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,760
你看到附近有这些特征的人吗?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You seen anybody around here answers that description?

253
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,130
你说你是警长? 我怎么不认识你?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Say you're a sheriff? How's it I don't recognize you?

254
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,700
我们从伍兹县那边来的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}We're from way over in woods county.

255
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,140
我们现在要找的柯里
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Now, this curry we're looking for,

256
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,630
他在密苏里州和
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}he's got a warrant on him there

257
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,900
田纳西州都有逮捕令
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}in Missouri and Tennessee.

258
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,760
他可能自称是执法人员
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Might also claim he's the law.

259
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,780
他曾经玩过这种把戏
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}He's got a history of such chicanery.

260
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,660
但远非如此
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Far from it.

261
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,560
他是个杀手
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}He's a killer.

262
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,480
他会再次杀人
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}He will kill again.

263
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,250
你不会用那把枪
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You're not fixin' to shoot

264
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,800
朝我们射击吧 是吗?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}any of us with that pistol, are you?

265
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,790
目前我没理由这么做
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}So far I got no reason to.

266
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,130
是个好消息
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}That's good news.

267
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:50,500
农夫 在你举起那把枪前得想清楚
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You'll want to think'fore you raise that thing up, farmer.

268
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,320
没什么好担心的 朋友
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Nothing to be worried about here, friend.

269
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,380
只是我正在做的一个小东西
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Just a little project I'm working on,

270
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,580
仅此而已
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}that's all.

271
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,180
有多少人住在这里?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}How many people live out here?

272
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,420
这和你有什么关系?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}What difference is that to you?

273
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,800
我只是想确定你是安全的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I'm trying to make sure you're safe, is all.

274
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,160
这似乎不归你管
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Wouldn't seem to be your business,

275
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,400
因为你是从伍兹县来的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}seeing as how you're from woods county.

276
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,860
你结过婚?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You married?

277
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,560
我看见那边有一座坟墓
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Saw a grave over there.

278
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,060
是我妻子
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}My wife.

279
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,820
十年前死于肺结核
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Died ten years back from tuberculosis.

280
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,180
节哀顺变
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}My condolences.

281
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,000
可怕的离开方式
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Horrible way to go.

282
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,920
爸爸 告诉他们
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Tell'em, pa. Tell'em!

283
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:36,300
墓上刻着 玛丽・霍布斯・麦卡蒂
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Marie hobbs mccarty, the marker said.

284
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,660
你姓麦卡蒂?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Your last name mccarty?

285
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,110
没错
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}That's right.

286
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,320
名字呢?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}First name?

287
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:47,240
亨利
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Henry.

288
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,930
我猜霍布斯是她的族人
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}So hobbs was her people, I'm guessing.

289
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,860
因为我看到东边有个霍布斯农场
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}'Cause I noticed a hobbs ranch to the east of here.

290
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,600
是她的兄弟
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Her brothers.

291
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,300
嗯
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Uh-huh.

292
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,200
嗯 从这些东西来看
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Well, from the looks of things,

293
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:04,010
你在这里已经住了多年
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}you've been out here a good many years.

294
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,560
环境不错
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Nice situation.

295
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,380
都依偎在这群山中
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}All nestled up here in the hills.

296
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,210
从远处很难发现
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Hard to see from a distance.

297
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,650
这跟你要找的那个人有什么关系?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}What's any of this got to do with the man you're lookin' for?

298
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,150
关系不大 我承认
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Not much, I'll Grant you.

299
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,000
很久以前 呃...
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Long time ago, uh...

300
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,940
有个人在新墨西哥州和亚利桑那州惹了些麻烦
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Was a fella caused some trouble down Arizona, new Mexico way.

301
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,760
听说他叫麦卡蒂
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Heard he went by the name mccarty.

302
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:35,840
我想知道他是不是你的亲戚
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I was wondering if he might be your kin.

303
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,420
你找错人了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You got the wrong pig by the ear.

304
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:40,920
意思是?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Meaning?

305
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,810
除了这里 我不认识任何地方的麦卡蒂
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I don't know no mccartys anywhere but here,

306
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:46,910
我所有亲戚都死了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}and all my kin is deceased.

307
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,660
现在我的木柴
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Now I got chores to tend to

308
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,660
不够做晚饭 我要干活去了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}and scant wood to cook my supper.

309
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,980
我没见过你要找的人
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I ain't seen the man you're after.

310
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,030
我会保持警惕
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I'll keep my eyes peeled.

311
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,700
如果我在切克沙见到他
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Be sure to alert the good sheriff

312
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:02,930
肯定会通知好警长
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}in chickasha if I should run across him.

313
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,220
那好吧
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Well, then.

314
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:09,880
谢谢你的帮助
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I thank you for your help.

315
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,500
看起来线索又断了 伙计们
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Looks like another dead end, boys.

316
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,950
你今晚一定要关好门
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You be sure to lock your doors tonight.

317
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:22,840
注意安全
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Stay safe.

318
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:27,680
走吧
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Come on.

319
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,900
现在你想用这个了吗?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Now you're inclined to hang onto that?

320
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,120
我想你可能需要帮助
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I thought you might be needin' help.

321
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,920
你想告诉我这是怎么用的吗?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You wanna tell me how this got fired?

322
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:56,960
我会用 爸爸
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Honest, pa.

323
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,240
别骗我
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Don't you lie to me!

324
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,440
我知道它如何使用
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I wanted to know what it's like.

325
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:06,580
我是50英里内唯一一个从未开过枪的男孩
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I am the only boy for 50 miles that's never fired one.

326
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:09,400
你甚至不让我碰你的旧猎枪
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You won't even let me lay hand on your old shotgun.

327
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:13,040
所以你不教我射击 我只能自己学
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}So if you can't teach me proper, I gotta do it myself.

328
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:17,470
如果你再动我的枪 我就揍你
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You get into my things again, I will crack your crust!

329
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,420
你就是个又蠢又没用的老头
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You're a stupid, worthless old man.

330
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,360
一辈子除了守着这破农场
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}A whole life, and nothin' to show for it

331
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:26,880
根本无所作为
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}but this rundown old farm

332
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:30,380
还有一个会离开你 让你孤独老死的男孩
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}and a boy who's gonna leave you alone to die as soon as he's able.

333
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:44,520
让我猜猜
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Let me guess.

334
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:48,740
你会告诉我他不是伍兹县的治安官
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You gon' tell me that he ain't the sheriff of woods county, you are.

335
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,200
他们不是 他们是银行劫匪
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}They ain't lawmen, they're bank robbers.

336
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,740
好吧 他们干了些什么
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Well, what's left of them, anyway.

337
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:57,680
抢劫了亚当斯快车
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Knocked over the Adams express.

338
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:01,240
我和副手追上去杀了其中两人
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Me and my deputies gave chase, killed two of'em,

339
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:02,640
包括那个携带赃款的人
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}including the one carrying the loot.

340
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,520
银行劫匪戴着徽章?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Bank robbers wearin' badges?

341
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,190
他们从我们这里偷的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}That they took off me and my men.

342
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:08,900
他是冒充执法人员
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}He's the one impersonating the law.

343
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,340
但是你把钱拿走了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}But you made off with the money.

344
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,460
见鬼 是的 我拿了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Hell, yeah, I grabbed it.

345
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,680
那你为什么不带着钱回伍兹县?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Then why ain't you back with it in woods county?

346
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:24,100
噢 不知道 为什么要这么做?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Oh, I don't know. Why does it look like?

347
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:28,280
我的首要任务是
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}And my first priority was

348
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:29,900
活着逃离那些人
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}getting away from that bunch alive.

349
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,020
这就是为什么我拼命跑 直到晕倒
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}That's why I rode like hell till I couldn't no more.

350
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,880
我记得的最后一件事 就是在这里醒来
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}There's the last thing I remembered, till I woke up here.

351
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:39,940
听着 我知道这些话对你来说都很荒谬
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Look, I know what I'm saying sounds ridiculous to you and all.

352
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,360
确实如此
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}That it does.

353
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,060
我不知道他们刚才为什么没开枪杀了你
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Why they didn't shoot you dead on the spot just now, I don't know.

354
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:46,760
但我可以向你保证...
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}But I can guarantee you...

355
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:49,340
他们会回来的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}They'll be back.

356
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,020
我唯一不明白是
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Only thing I can't figure

357
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,220
那老头为什么会为一个陌生人冒生命危险
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}is why the old man would risk his neck for a stranger.

358
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,230
也许他得到了一笔钱
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Maybe he got offered a cut of the money.

359
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:55,360
有些迹象表明不是这样
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Something tells me that ain't it.

360
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:59,500
我们谁都可以干掉他
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Any one of us could have taken him out.

361
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,900
这就是我们现在该做的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Which is what we should do now.

362
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:06,110
- 马上行动  - 还不行
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}- Ride up, finish it.  - Not just yet.

363
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,540
因为那个东倒西歪的老农?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}'Cause of some shaky old farmer?

364
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:15,280
他不像我见过的任何农民那样拿枪
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}He didn't hold that pistol like any farmer I've ever seen.

365
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,660
我们有三个人
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}There are three of us.

366
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:22,390
我们不会抢银行 也不会不了解情况
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}We don't run up in a bank, or ride up on a stage

367
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:23,680
就去抢劫驿站
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}without knowing who's in it.

368
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:27,260
但我们知道柯里带着钱在房子里
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}We know curry's in there. With our money!

369
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:31,120
这就是你要去侦察那个所谓农夫之家的原因
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Which is why you're going to reconnoiter that so-called farmer's place

370
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,440
确保柯里还没有逃走
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}and make sure curry don't skedaddle.

371
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,320
很乐意
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Gladly.

372
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,000
在我们到之前不要妄动
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Don't make a move till we get there.

373
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:41,320
好的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Fine.

374
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,820
- 达根  - 我说很好
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}- Duggan.  - I said fine.

375
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:56,000
明早日出时 你跟我去切克沙
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Come sunup, you and me will head into chickasha,

376
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:57,560
雇几个枪手
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}hire some guns.

377
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,360
知道了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Understood.

378
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:04,900
途中我们顺带拜访农夫霍布斯...
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}On the way, we'll pay a call on farmer hobbs...

379
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:07,670
看看他有没有关于
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Find out if he's got anything interesting

380
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:10,300
老亨利・麦卡蒂的事要告诉我们
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}to tell us about ol' Henry mccarty.

381
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:13,200
怀亚特
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Wyatt. Come on in.

382
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,120
进来吧
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Come on in.

383
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,480
- 我快做完了  - 留到早上做
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}- I'm almost finished.  - Leave it till morning.

384
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:22,720
快点
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Come on.

385
00:48:53,610 --> 00:48:56,580
如果我能自己吃饭 就方便了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}It'd be a damn sight easier if I could feed myself.

386
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:02,120
一点都不给你吃更方便
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Be a damn sight easier not to feed you at all.

387
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:21,770
- 我们曾经见过吗?  - 我会记得的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}- You and me ever met?  - That I'd remember.

388
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,120
你当警长多久了?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}How long you been a sheriff?

389
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:35,060
- 到现在已经18年了  - 你是怎么开始的?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}- I'd say onto 18 years now.  - How'd you get your start?

390
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:39,250
我是大比尔・汤普森在斯特斯普陵的副手
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I was a deputy for big bill Thompson in Baxter Springs.

391
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:44,240
斯特斯普陵 密苏里州?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Baxter Springs. Baxter Springs, Missouri?

392
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:49,100
- 堪萨斯州  - 瘦个子 大耳朵?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}- Kansas.  - Skinny fella, big ears?

393
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,560
很壮
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Heavyset.

394
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:54,760
一个喝醉的矿工
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Missing part of his left ear from

395
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,940
开枪打掉他一块耳朵
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}a drunk miner taking a potshot at him.

396
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,700
- 我听说是个喝醉的妓女  - 噢 是吗?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}- I heard it was a drunk whore.  - Oh, you did?

397
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:05,750
你住在斯特斯普陵的哪个地方?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Which part of Baxter Springs you live in?

398
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,980
一家旅馆 在格兰特驿站附近
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}A boarding house. Out near Grant's stage station.

399
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:13,150
女店主叫什么名字?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}What was the landlady's name?

400
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:15,980
她不是淑女
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}She weren't no lady.

401
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,460
她叫汉娜 是个讨厌的老太婆
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}She a nasty ol' cuss named Hannah.

402
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:25,200
你见过乔治・克鲁克吗?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You ever run into a George crook?

403
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,980
你是说乔治将军?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You mean general George?

404
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,270
这混蛋毕生致力于
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Sumbitch dedicated his life

405
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,440
把印第安人赶出该地区
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}to driving the caddo out of the territory.

406
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,920
你到底是怎么来到斯特斯普陵的?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}How in the hell did you end up in Baxter Springs?

407
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:57,960
就像其他梦想着
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Well, like every other fool

408
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,270
轻松挖矿发财的傻瓜一样
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}dreaming of easy riches and digging for tin.

409
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,640
直到我意识到根本是做梦
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Till I realized there weren't none.

410
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,240
只不过是一堆关于烟山河矿区的传说
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Just a bunch of ghost stories about a mine near smokey hill river.

411
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:09,060
然后我... 我破产了 工作很难找
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Then I... I was broke. Work was hard to come by.

412
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,500
我很幸运大比尔喜欢我
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I'm lucky big bill took a liking to me.

413
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:15,300
否则我... 我不知道我会怎么样
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Otherwise I... I don't know what would have come of me.

414
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:21,180
很抱歉 我之前袭击了你儿子
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I... I'm sorry I jumped your boy before.

415
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,800
我在一个陌生的地方醒来 不知道他是谁...
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I woke up in a strange place, didn't know who he was...

416
00:51:26,490 --> 00:51:28,580
我以为在某个藏身处被扣为人质
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I was being held hostage in some hideout.

417
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,220
你觉得这像个藏身处吗?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}This look like a hideout to you?

418
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,740
我无意中听到他之前说的话
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I overheard what he said earlier.

419
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:38,480
他不是那个意思
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}He didn't mean any of that.

420
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:41,610
对 他不是那意思
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Yes, he did.

421
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:02,320
我解开你一只手 别让我再绑起来
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I'll give you one hand free. Don't make me take it off.

422
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:03,680
好吧
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}All right.

423
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:10,460
好吧
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}All right.

424
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,790
你父亲也是农民吗?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Was farming what your daddy did?

425
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:37,300
我爸爸在我3岁时就死了 在堪萨斯州
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}My daddy died when I was 3, up in Kansas.

426
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:40,770
除了种地 他几乎什么都做
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}And he did near everything but work the land.

427
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,940
我15岁时成了孤儿
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I was orphaned at 15.

428
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,980
比我成为孤儿的时间少了13年
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}That's 13 years longer than I knew my folks.

429
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,280
啊 你在哪里长大的?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Ah. Whereabouts you grow up?

430
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:54,920
新墨西哥州
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}New Mexico.

431
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,360
- 哪个地方?  - 萨姆纳堡
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}- Which part?  - Fort Sumner.

432
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,320
土生土长 听说过那里吗?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Born and raised. You heard of it?

433
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:07,400
比利小子被杀的地方 是吗?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Where Billy the kid was shot, wasn't it?

434
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,600
那里就是因此闻名的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Main reason anyone know it.

435
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:18,870
事情发生当晚我就在那里
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I was there the night it happened.

436
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:23,380
情况怎样?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}How's that?

437
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:25,700
我当时只是个孩子
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I was just a boy.

438
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:27,420
我曾经为一个叫
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I used to make what money I could

439
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:30,500
彼得・麦克斯韦的人做零工努力挣钱
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}doing chores for a fella by the name of Peter Maxwell.

440
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,780
彼得・麦克斯韦安排比利过夜
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Same Peter Maxwell put the kid up for the night.

441
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,720
他同时又给加勒特及他的副手
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Same Peter Maxwell tipped off Garrett

442
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:37,460
波和麦金尼通风报信说
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}and his deputies, poe and mckinney,

443
00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:38,680
比利小子躲在那里
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}the kid was holed up there.

444
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,780
我正在打扫马厩
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I was sweeping the stalls.

445
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:43,320
当我看到加勒特走进房子时 我...
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}When I saw Garrett walk in the house, I...

446
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:45,300
我脑子里一片空白
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I don't think nothing of it.

447
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,660
但比利不在里面 至少那时不在
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}But Billy wasn't in there. Not then, leastways.

448
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:51,880
- 知道我怎么知道?  - 怎么?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}- Know how I know?  - How?

449
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:54,040
在离我不到20盏牡胤
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}He was barefoot in his shin sleeves,

450
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:55,740
他正赤脚挽起袖子
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}cutting the meat off a deer carcass

451
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:57,540
在鹿的身上切下肉
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}not 20 feet from where I was working.

452
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:03,960
我看见他从谷仓门往里偷看
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I saw him peer through the barn door,

453
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:06,260
他看到了波和麦金尼在门廊上
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}and he saw poe and mckinney on the porch there.

454
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:10,320
他停止切肉 直视我的眼睛
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}He stopped carving, looked me dead in my eye.

455
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:13,980
他说 “低下头 你会没事的”
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}He said, "keep your head down, you'll be all right."

456
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,660
比利冲进麦克斯韦的房间
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}So Billy went straight to Maxwell's room,

457
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:20,300
他很快意识到不只是麦克斯韦在里面
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}realized pretty quick it ain't just Maxwell in there.

458
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,840
他喊道 “是谁? 是谁?”
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}He called out, "?quien es? ?quien es?"

459
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:27,760
因为比利的西班牙语说得和墨西哥人一样好
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}'Cause Billy spoke Spanish as good as a Mexican.

460
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,080
怎么回应的?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Pat's answer?

461
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:35,950
开了两枪 一枪打偏 另一枪打中胸部
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Two shots. One wide of the Mark, and the other one in the chest.

462
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:42,340
这就是比利小子的结局
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}That was the end of Billy the kid.

463
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,100
你都看到了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}And you seen it all.

464
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:49,030
我确实看到了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I most certainly did.

465
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:50,870
也看到比利的尸体被拖走
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Saw the kid's body get hauled off too,

466
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,020
裹在血淋淋的被单里
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}wrapped in a bloody sheet.

467
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:55,900
这让我意识到这不是我的生活
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Enough to teach me that ain't no life for me.

468
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:58,740
我宁愿停止这种疯狂行为也不想陷入其中
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I'd rather stop this crazy than be part of it anyway.

469
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,200
好吧...
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Well...

470
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:26,440
该死
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Damn.

471
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,360
如果我知道一个好故事足以让你放我走
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}If I knew all it took was a good story for you to cut me loose.

472
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,380
你现在能坐稳马鞍吗?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You well enough to stay upright in the saddle?

473
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:39,880
- 应该可以  - 我要你离开这里
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}- Not hardly.  - I want you out of here.

474
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,200
我想等到黎明走不是个好选择?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I suppose waiting till sunup ain't an option?

475
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,360
如果我一个人在这里 就不同了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}If I was alone out here, it'd be different.

476
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:47,980
那么 我想我准备好了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Well, then, I guess I'm ready.

477
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:50,920
好的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Good.

478
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:55,640
拿去
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Take it.

479
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:02,820
我去拿你的包
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I'll fetch your loot.

480
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:40,140
- 爸爸?  - 怀亚特 蹲下
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}- Pa?  - Wyatt! Get down!

481
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:44,740
我想我没事
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I-I think I'm all right.

482
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:48,120
他中枪了吗?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Is... is he hit?

483
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:58,280
他只是昏过去了 给我枪
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}He just passed out. Give me that.

484
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,040
我用枪比你想象的好
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I'm better with it than you think.

485
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,900
除非我教你正确的方法
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Not until I teach you proper.

486
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,780
- 我自学过了  - 嘘
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}- I've taught myself  - shush.

487
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:07,720
你们到哪里去了?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Now, where'd you get to?

488
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,610
- 他在房子下面  - 嘘
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}- He's under the house.  - Shh.

489
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:52,520
我希望你知道如何用这个
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I hope you got good enough with this.

490
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:56,250
上帝不希望发生这种事 但开枪射人
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}God forbid it happens, but shooting a man

491
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,200
与射击靶子不同...
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}is different than hitting a target...

492
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,740
一旦越线就回不来了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}A line you can't cross back over.

493
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:01,580
我懂
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I know that.

494
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:03,420
在你做过之前 你不会懂
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You couldn't until you've done it.

495
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:06,790
如果他进来...
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}If he comes in here...

496
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:09,100
你就扣动扳机
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You pull that trigger.

497
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:12,230
瞄准胸部
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Aim for the chest.

498
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:15,240
并连续开火直到击中
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}And keep firing until you hit it.

499
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,640
你要去哪里?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Where you going?

500
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:56,740
狗杂种
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Son of a bitch!

501
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:58,660
混蛋
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Cocksucker!

502
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:00,240
妈的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Fuck.

503
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:09,360
该死
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Shit.

504
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:42,180
其他人呢? 他们在附近吗?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Where's the others? They close?

505
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:43,490
去死吧
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Go to hell.

506
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,330
这种方式我见得太多
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I've been here too often to let

507
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:49,220
你这种人岂能瞒过我
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}a man of your caliber overhaul my baggage.

508
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:53,940
回答我 否则你现在就完蛋
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Answer me, or it ends for you right now.

509
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:56,960
去死吧 你这混蛋
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Go to hell, you bastard.

510
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:58,740
他想杀了我们两个
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}He was fixin' to kill us both.

511
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:02,500
我看见了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I saw.

512
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:05,920
他可能只是来侦查 然后想一人搞定
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Probably here to watch and got greedy.

513
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:09,180
其他人会来的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}The others will be coming.

514
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:14,480
首先 我们得把尸体处理掉
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}First thing, we gotta get rid of this body.

515
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,660
我们要怎么做?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}How we gonna do that?

516
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:23,580
你不用来
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}We ain't.

517
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,220
我知道这感觉不好
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I know it don't feel like it.

518
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:27,180
你很幸运只是擦伤
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You're lucky it just grazed ya.

519
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:33,500
如果你知道我找到了那把枪
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}If you know I found that gun,

520
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,400
你就知道我看到了壁橱后面的东西
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}you know I saw what's in the back of that closet.

521
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:40,480
你是谁?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Who are you?

522
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:43,640
我就是我
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I'm who I am.

523
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:48,040
你不是一直在说要诚实吗?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Aren't you always preaching about being honest?

524
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:48,820
{\fs16\pos(192,35)\c&HEEEEEE&\1a&H26&}出自《圣经》

525
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:50,480
“真相将还你自由”?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}The truth will set you free?

526
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:54,820
我从来没有骗过你
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I've never lied to you.

527
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:06,620
把整件事情告诉我不是一回事吗?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Isn't not telling me the whole story the same damn thing?

528
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:15,220
我做了一些我希望能收回的事
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I've done things I wish I could take back.

529
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:19,240
在有你之前很久 在有你妈妈之前
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}A long time before you. Before your ma.

530
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:23,120
你不该听到的事情
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Things that you got no business hearing.

531
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:27,220
如果你不尊重我 我又怎么尊重你?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}How am I supposed to respect you if you ain't respecting me?

532
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,080
我尊重你
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I am respecting you.

533
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:32,300
如果你不明白这点
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}And if you don't understand that,

534
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:34,260
那我刚才说的你一个字都没听见
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}you ain't heard a word I just said.

535
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:39,060
不 我听到了 我只是一点都不信
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}No, I heard it. I just don't believe a bit of it.

536
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,140
{\i1}低下头
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Keep your head down.

537
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:24,560
低下头 你会没事的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Keep your head down. You'll be all right.

538
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:26,180
{\i1}你会没事的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You'll be all right.

539
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:26,660
喔
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Whoa.

540
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:36,620
- 早  - 早
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}- Morning  - morning.

541
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:40,670
- 我能帮你什么吗?  - 我确实希望如此
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}- Something I can help you with?  - I sure hope so.

542
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:45,850
你这地方真好 安宁 平静
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Nice place you got here. Peaceful. Quiet.

543
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:49,280
打鸟
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Bird hunting.

544
01:06:50,450 --> 01:06:52,750
没什么能比得上打一群鸟更好了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Nothing quite like the flush of the bevy.

545
01:06:54,650 --> 01:06:56,140
你肯定很擅长开枪
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You must be quite the shot.

546
01:06:58,560 --> 01:06:59,660
尽力而为
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Do what I can.

547
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:01,830
我很羡慕你
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I envy you.

548
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:04,380
尽管我这几天很想
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I don't get to go out hunting

549
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:06,140
但却没法出去打猎
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}as much as I'd like to these days.

550
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:08,910
先生 有什么能帮你的吗?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Something I can help you with, mister?

551
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,220
我爸爸过去常打野鸡
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}My daddy used to hunt pheasant.

552
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:16,240
打理它们一直是我该死的事
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}It was always my damn job to clean'em.

553
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:21,200
噢 割开胸部皮肤 把它剥开
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Oh, cutting the skin on the breast, peeling it back.

554
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:25,720
但做久了 我找到了去除内脏
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}But over time, I figured the best way

555
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,300
最好的方法...
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}to get rid of their innards...

556
01:07:28,590 --> 01:07:32,320
就是把鸟的背劈开 就那么做
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Was to split the bird's back. Get to'em that way.

557
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:36,440
你也这么发现的吗?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Is that what you find?

558
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:37,860
听着 我不...
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Look, I don't...

559
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:40,600
我觉得不太礼貌 但是...
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Mean to be UN-neighborly, but...

560
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:43,580
开门见山吗? 当然
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}But get to the point? Sure.

561
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:48,360
我想问你几个问题 呃
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I wanted to ask you a couple questions about, uh,

562
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:49,910
是有关你妹夫的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}your brother-in-law.

563
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,360
那么 你关心他什么?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Well, what concern is he of yours?

564
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:56,220
这就是我想弄明白的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}That's what I'm trying to figure out.

565
01:07:57,350 --> 01:07:59,380
你看 我有个疯狂的想法...
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You see, I got this crazy idea...

566
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:01,920
对老麦卡蒂来说
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}There might be more to ol' mccarty

567
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:03,240
远比看到的更多
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}than meets the eye.

568
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:05,760
你应该是个执法人员之类的吧?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You supposed be some kind of lawman or something?

569
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:07,660
差不多
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Something like that.

570
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:10,970
我想你该走了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Well, I think it's time you left.

571
01:08:11,730 --> 01:08:13,770
哦 我们来这里寻找一些答案
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Well, we came here for some answers.

572
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,870
在找到答案前不会离开
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}We ain't leaving till I get'em.

573
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:19,400
是吗?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}That so?

574
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:25,040
我应该...
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I should...

575
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:33,240
现在我们怎么让他清醒过来?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Now how the hell we gonna pick his ass up?

576
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:45,760
好吧 好的 谢谢
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Okay. Okay, thank you.

577
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:02,320
天哪 好吧
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Oh, god. Okay.

578
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:06,180
我无法旅行 我走不了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I'm no good to travel. I'm not.

579
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:09,420
你带着孩子 你们离开这里
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You take the boy, you get out of here.

580
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:11,830
当凯彻姆和他的手下来时
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}When ketchum and his men arrive,

581
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:13,500
我会尽量拖住他们
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I'll hold them off as long as I can.

582
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:15,820
- 见鬼去吧  - 怀亚特
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}- The hell with that!  - Wyatt.

583
01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:18,580
我们有枪
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}We got guns.

584
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:21,470
你已经徒手杀了他们中一个
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You already killed one of them barehanded.

585
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:24,120
打个包 我们离开
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Fill a pack. We're leaving.

586
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:27,100
我警告过你
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I'm warning you.

587
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:56,240
他回来了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}He's back.

588
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:07,600
剩下的留着吧
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Leave the rest.

589
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:09,360
我们不能把他留在这里等死
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}We can't just leave him here to die.

590
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:11,180
我他妈肯定不会因为
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I am damn sure not gonna lose you

591
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:12,860
一些与我们无关的事失去你
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}over something that ain't our fight.

592
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:13,940
你爸爸是对的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Your pa's right.

593
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:15,820
我已经长大了 可以自己决定
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I am old enough to make my own decisions,

594
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:17,780
不管你是否愿意接受
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}whether you are ready to accept that or not.

595
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:19,900
这是我要解决的事
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Yeah. This is mine to finish.

596
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:21,980
快走吧 我不会有事
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Go on, now. I'll be all right.

597
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:55,380
喔
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Whoa.

598
01:10:59,100 --> 01:10:59,940
柯里
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Curry!

599
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:02,380
家里有人吗?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Anybody home?

600
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:05,860
你们需要什么吗?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You gentlemen need something?

601
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:08,740
我们是来抓逃犯的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}We're here for our fugitive.

602
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:11,660
我昨天告诉过你没见过他
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I told you yesterday I ain't seen him.

603
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:15,480
我的直觉告诉我那不是真的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}My intuition tells me that's not true.

604
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:18,120
我就直说了...
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I'll make it easy...

605
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:22,160
你把他交出来 我们就放过你和孩子
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You hand him over, we let you and the boy go free.

606
01:11:23,190 --> 01:11:26,100
另一个选择是 我们带走他
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}The other option is, we take him.

607
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:28,220
你和那个孩子死
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}And you and the boy die.

608
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:30,780
你接受这个交易
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You take that deal.

609
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:32,880
这是我的事 不是你的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I signed up for this, you didn't.

610
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:40,160
看看你的马已经备好鞍了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}See your horses are already saddled.

611
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:42,660
你们可以骑着它离开这里
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You can just ride on out of here.

612
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:50,860
你和我都知道在我们上马前就会被杀
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You and I both know we'll be dead before we mount our horses.

613
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:56,820
在这变成一场屠杀之前
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Fore this turns into some kinda brigasee,

614
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:59,420
你我为什么不用决斗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}why don't me and you settle this,

615
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:01,000
来解决问题
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}knuckle and skull.

616
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,740
你作为一个农民经常打架
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You got a lot of fight for a farmer.

617
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:09,040
这种表演不是办法
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}That ain't the way this plays out.

618
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:12,200
把他带上来
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Bring him up!

619
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:25,960
艾尔?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Al?

620
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:55,340
听我说 有些事很快就会发生
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Listen to me. What's gonna happen will happen quick.

621
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:58,250
我会尽量拖住他们 你悄悄溜出去
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I'll stall long as I can, but I want you to sneak out back

622
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:00,000
躲到罗杰的磨坊里...
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}and hole up at Roger's mill...

623
01:13:00,150 --> 01:13:01,320
在那里等我
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}And wait for me there.

624
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:03,740
只有必要时才用这个
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Only use this if you have to.

625
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:05,200
让我参战
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Let me fight.

626
01:13:05,260 --> 01:13:07,920
如果你留下会让我没法集中精力
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I can't do this right if I'm worried about protecting you.

627
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:09,300
把我交出去
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Just turn me over.

628
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,280
不然他们会杀了我们所有人
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You don't, they're gonna kill us all.

629
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:15,000
你我都清楚 不管怎样他们都会杀了我们
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You and me both know they're fixin' to do that anyway.

630
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:17,580
你觉得我能在枪战中安全离开吗?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}And yet you expect me to run out into sure gunfire?

631
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:19,260
你儿子说得对
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Your boy's right.

632
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:26,420
呆在里面
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Stay inside.

633
01:13:26,540 --> 01:13:27,900
离窗户远点
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Stay away from the window.

634
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:31,520
如果你必须开枪 瞄准胸部 然后...
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You have to shoot, aim for the chest, and...

635
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:33,180
继续开火 直到我击中
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Keep firing till I hit something.

636
01:13:50,970 --> 01:13:54,380
我一直都怀疑你什么来头 亨利・麦卡蒂
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I've had some suspicions about who you are, Henry mccarty.

637
01:13:57,020 --> 01:13:58,000
我得承认
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I got to admit,

638
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:01,200
这名字像根刺一样扎在我心里
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}that name sticks in me like a Thorn.

639
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:04,400
我的好奇心被勾起了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}My curiosity was aroused.

640
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:08,160
我希望艾尔能给我们一些提示
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I was hoping al here might shed some light.

641
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:11,240
但他拒绝说
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}He wouldn't say shit.

642
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:14,400
即使在我的人...
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Even after my boys were...

643
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:18,680
怎么说呢? 呃 在他们的强烈要求下
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}What's the word? Uh, emphatic in their question.

644
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:23,070
你可能觉得我不是警长
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You probably concluded I'm no sheriff.

645
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:25,840
这些人也不是我的副手
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Nor are these men my deputies.

646
01:14:27,020 --> 01:14:30,480
在一个月前 我们中没人去过伍兹县
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Not a one of us had spent time in woods county before a month ago.

647
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:33,500
那你呢?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}What about you?

648
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:36,240
你来自哪里?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Where'd you come from?

649
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:39,980
除了这里 世界上任何地方
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Every place on earth but this.

650
01:14:42,620 --> 01:14:43,600
就这样吧
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}So be it.

651
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:45,360
最后条件
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Last offer.

652
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:48,800
这是为柯里治安官和钱
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}This tongue-tied piece of shit

653
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,960
准备的一堆口是心非的废话
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}for sheriff curry in there and the money.

654
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:52,580
你得到你想要的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You get what you want.

655
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:54,460
我得到我想要的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I get what I want.

656
01:14:55,180 --> 01:14:57,840
我们各奔东西 没有流血
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}We go our separate ways without blood spilled.

657
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:01,220
不是你的 也不是我的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Not yours, not mine.

658
01:15:02,180 --> 01:15:05,910
我看到不是你的孩子在透过窗户观察这里
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Not that boy of yours I see surveilling all this through that window.

659
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:09,140
如果我想流血
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}If I wanted bloodshed,

660
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:12,020
我早就从那里破门而入了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I'd have busted in there guns a-blazin' a long time ago.

661
01:15:13,490 --> 01:15:14,800
我相信你明白
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I believe you know that.

662
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:18,500
你把我内兄留在原地
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You leave my brother-in-law right where he is.

663
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:22,300
转身离开我的房子
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Turn and ride your asses off my property.

664
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:25,800
你照做 我就让你活命
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You do that, and I'll let you live.

665
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:31,700
你们听到了吗 伙计们?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You hear that, fellas?

666
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:35,280
这是一个温和老农说的话吗?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Is that the talk of a mild old sodbuster?

667
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:36,980
我想不是
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I think not.

668
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:39,200
不是
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Nah.

669
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:42,080
这听起来完全是另外一回事
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}That sounds like something else altogether.

670
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:45,180
霍布斯
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Hobbs!

671
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:49,260
你能告诉我什么事可能改变这个僵局吗?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Anything you could tell me might change the equation here?

672
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:55,460
来舔我屁股 你这唠叨的混蛋
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Kiss my ass, you long-winded son of a bitch.

673
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:01,540
我再给你一次机会
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You got a pair, I'll give you that.

674
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:06,680
最后机会 艾尔
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Last chance, al.

675
01:16:10,210 --> 01:16:12,060
你根本不知道
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You have no idea

676
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:15,740
你将释放的是地狱风暴
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}the hell storm you fixin' to let loose.

677
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:20,820
请注意我的警告
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Consider me properly warned.

678
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:28,360
冷静
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Easy.

679
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:30,260
喔
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Whoa.

680
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:34,900
冷静点 伙计
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Easy, fella.

681
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:44,620
该死的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Goddamn.

682
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:47,280
看这个
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Look at that.

683
01:16:48,410 --> 01:16:49,780
她完成了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I'd say she's done.

684
01:16:50,140 --> 01:16:51,820
这不是一件漂亮的东西吗?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Ain't that a thing of beauty?

685
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:00,880
怀亚特
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Wyatt!

686
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:06,500
进去
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Get in!

687
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:18,020
你还和我们在一起吗?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You still with us?

688
01:17:18,740 --> 01:17:19,740
别管我
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Less of me.

689
01:17:21,780 --> 01:17:23,020
哇 哇
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Whoa. Whoa.

690
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:31,080
麦卡蒂
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Mccarty!

691
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:34,620
你死了吗?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You dead yet?

692
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:36,780
当然没有
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I sure ain't.

693
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:38,820
今天早上我没有看到
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I'm assuming the fact I ain't seen

694
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:40,540
我的人达根
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}my man duggan this morning

695
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,400
这意味着他肯定和你有冲突
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}means he must have crossed paths with you,

696
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:45,920
事情未按他的方式进行
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}and things didn't go his way.

697
01:17:48,340 --> 01:17:51,020
我刚刚在这里杀了你的人
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Seeing as how I just killed your man al here,

698
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:53,580
对我们来说公平了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I'd say that squares us.

699
01:17:54,580 --> 01:17:55,700
别再玩游戏了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}No more games.

700
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,280
你有一分钟的时间出来
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You got one minute to come out.

701
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,180
你差点害死我们俩
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You nearly got us both killed,

702
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:05,460
你所有的眼泪和愤怒也差不多了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}which is about all your tears and rage would have amounted to.

703
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:10,800
现在把头低下 你会没事的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Now keep your damn head down. You'll be all right.

704
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:19,140
{\i1}低下头
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Keep your head down,

705
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:20,920
{\i1}你会没事的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}you'll be all right.

706
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:30,140
波和麦金尼在门廊上
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Poe and mckinney were on the porch.

707
01:18:32,060 --> 01:18:33,420
加勒特闯进房子
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Garrett went in the house.

708
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:41,400
开了两枪...
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Two shots...

709
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:43,080
但他...
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}but he...

710
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:47,000
你对他们说西班牙语
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}And you were speaking Spanish to'em.

711
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:53,100
但他没有杀你
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}But he didn't kill you.

712
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:55,160
他帮你逃走了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}He helped you escape.

713
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:58,120
你就是他
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You're him.

714
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:02,160
他是谁?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}He's who?

715
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:05,980
邦尼
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Bonney.

716
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,020
爸爸 他在说什么?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Pa, what is he talking about?

717
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:12,150
{\fs16\pos(192,265)\c&HEEEEEE&\1a&H26&}比利小子 死了或活着

718
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:14,680
{\fs16\c&HEEEEEE&\1a&H26&\pos(192,283)}威廉・H・邦尼  更广为人知的名字是
{\fs20}比利小子

719
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:20,140
爸爸
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Pa!

720
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:29,560
明智的选择 朋友
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Smart choice, friend.

721
01:19:34,740 --> 01:19:35,700
{\fs16\pos(192,265)\c&HFFFFFF&}冷静点

722
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:38,200
{\fs16\pos(192,265)\c&HFFFFFF&}为时已晚

723
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:40,420
{\fs16\pos(192,265)\c&HFFFFFF&}这就是你的想法

724
01:19:40,580 --> 01:19:42,250
{\fs16\pos(192,265)\c&HFFFFFF&}我不知道 伙计

725
01:19:42,590 --> 01:19:43,660
他在说什么?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}What's he saying?

726
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:22,900
你不要逞能出去
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Don't you dare step outside.

727
01:22:13,690 --> 01:22:15,970
{\fs16\pos(192,265)\c&HFFFFFF&}没有人必须死

728
01:22:17,070 --> 01:22:19,100
{\fs16\pos(192,265)\c&HFFFFFF&}让我走

729
01:22:19,950 --> 01:22:22,060
{\fs16\pos(192,265)\c&HFFFFFF&}你可以留下钱

730
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:24,020
{\fs16\pos(192,265)\c&HFFFFFF&}解下你的枪套

731
01:22:24,450 --> 01:22:25,460
{\fs16\pos(192,265)\c&HFFFFFF&}快点

732
01:22:28,950 --> 01:22:30,830
{\fs16\pos(192,265)\c&HFFFFFF&}你会送我进监狱吗?

733
01:22:31,460 --> 01:22:34,300
{\fs16\pos(192,265)\c&HFFFFFF&}对警长来说 没错

734
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:37,140
啊
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Ah.

735
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:40,400
{\fs16\pos(192,265)\c&HFFFFFF&}我不担心他

736
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:41,500
啊
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Aah!

737
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:43,520
{\fs16\pos(192,265)\c&HFFFFFF&}去你的

738
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:26,900
妈的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Fuck.

739
01:26:54,780 --> 01:26:55,780
你没事吧?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You all right?

740
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:17,040
噢
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Oh.

741
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:21,700
怀亚特
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Wyatt.

742
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:24,720
拿桶水和一些布来
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Fetch a pail of water and some rags.

743
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:25,820
去吧
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Go on.

744
01:27:33,860 --> 01:27:36,020
你肯定见过更好的日子
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You've certainly seen better days.

745
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:38,340
我知道你有一张熟悉的脸
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I knew you had a familiar face.

746
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:41,220
一开始我还没意识到
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I just couldn't place it at first.

747
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:43,920
我们会去找医生
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}We'll get the doc.

748
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:46,880
但首先要止住血
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}First I gotta slow the bleed.

749
01:27:48,380 --> 01:27:50,560
这些年来 你是怎么躲起来的?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}How you manage to stay hidden all these years?

750
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:53,500
把衬衫袖子撕下来
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Let's get some of this shirt off you.

751
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:55,700
用来绑住腿
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I can use it to tie off this leg.

752
01:28:33,180 --> 01:28:34,240
哦 该死
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Well, shit.

753
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:36,860
我希望你没看见这事
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I wish you didn't see that.

754
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:46,680
就像我之前听你告诉你儿子的一样
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}It's just like I heard you tell your boy before.

755
01:28:47,700 --> 01:28:48,720
我没有撒谎
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Ain't that I lied,

756
01:28:49,780 --> 01:28:51,840
我只是没告诉你全部真相
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I just never told you the whole truth.

757
01:28:53,180 --> 01:28:54,620
你根本不是警察?
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Was you law at all?

758
01:28:55,420 --> 01:28:57,740
伍兹郡的治安官 就如我所说
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Sheriff of woods county, just like I said.

759
01:28:59,180 --> 01:29:02,440
我和我的副手们在春天和凯彻姆签约
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Me and my deputies, we signed on with ketchum back in the spring.

760
01:29:04,060 --> 01:29:05,680
我们必须接受他们的指挥
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}We had to take their brand.

761
01:29:07,060 --> 01:29:08,480
和他们一起做些事
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Done a few jobs with'em.

762
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:11,680
但我们发现他们打算在最后一次行动中杀了我们
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}But we figured out they was planning to gun us down on this last go.

763
01:29:13,290 --> 01:29:15,220
所以我们想先下手为强
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}So we tried to beat'em to the punch.

764
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:17,760
失败后 他们一直在追捕我
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Took off, and they plugged me from a distance.

765
01:29:20,030 --> 01:29:21,820
他们会追我到天涯海角
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}They'd have hunted me to the end of the earth.

766
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:26,040
很抱歉 我最后到了这里
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I'm sorry I ended up here.

767
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:30,180
你想要的真相 是我最不愿做的事
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Last thing I wanted, you wanna know the truth of it.

768
01:29:32,660 --> 01:29:34,200
因为那时你对我很好
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}'Cause you were good to me back then.

769
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:35,740
呵
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Huh.

770
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:38,840
我永远不会相信你做了他们说的那些事
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I could never square you done the things they said.

771
01:29:40,350 --> 01:29:42,500
虽然我现在确实可以相信
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Though I sure as hell can believe it now.

772
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,760
我甚至不记得你了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I don't even remember you.

773
01:29:55,930 --> 01:29:59,400
为什么要记得? 我只是个农场工人
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Well, why would you? I was just a ranch hand.

774
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:03,080
现在我要成为杀死比利小子的人了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Now I get to be the man who killed Billy the kid.

775
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:19,220
- 坚持住 我去找医生  - 不
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}- You hold on, I'll get the doc.  - No.

776
01:30:21,340 --> 01:30:22,190
爸爸
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Pa.

777
01:30:22,230 --> 01:30:24,460
我能走到今天是个奇迹
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}It's a miracle I made it this far.

778
01:30:27,820 --> 01:30:29,240
一旦这消息传出...
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Once this gets out...

779
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:32,540
你会听到一些关于我的事
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You gonna hear some things about me.

780
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:34,970
有些是真的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Some of it's true.

781
01:30:36,060 --> 01:30:37,340
但很多都不是
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}A lot of it ain't.

782
01:30:39,020 --> 01:30:40,140
实际上...
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}Fact is...

783
01:30:42,380 --> 01:30:45,820
我甚至都不知道我是谁或是什么了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I don't even know who or what I was anymore.

784
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:51,120
我不相信救赎
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I don't believe in redemption.

785
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:56,060
但一个男人可以找到一些慰藉...
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}But a man can find some kind of solace...

786
01:30:57,940 --> 01:31:00,400
如果他有你这样的孩子要抚养
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}If he's got a boy like you to raise.

787
01:31:03,140 --> 01:31:04,700
世界正在发生变化
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}The world is changing.

788
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:08,240
你去看看吧
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}You go see it.

789
01:31:09,780 --> 01:31:12,600
这不再是属于我的世界
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}It's a place I don't belong in no more.

790
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:17,560
我希望...
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs15\fscx90\fscy80\b0}I'm hoping...

791
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:20,340
你明白
