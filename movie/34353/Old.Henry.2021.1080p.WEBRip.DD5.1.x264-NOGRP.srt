2
00:01:07,981 --> 00:01:09,617
Ah.

3
00:02:15,682 --> 00:02:16,686
Come on.

4
00:02:39,973 --> 00:02:41,043
Look at me.

5
00:02:47,682 --> 00:02:48,884
Where'd he get to?

6
00:02:57,793 --> 00:02:59,527
Where'd he get to?

7
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:01,028
I don't know.

8
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,669
No!

9
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:19,881
Get the rope.

10
00:03:23,016 --> 00:03:27,521
We's... headin' east,
towards Indian Territory.

11
00:03:30,891 --> 00:03:32,895
He's in a bad way.

12
00:03:37,063 --> 00:03:39,067
Is that everything
you have to say on the matter?

13
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:41,635
I swear. I swear!

14
00:03:42,704 --> 00:03:43,838
You know what?

15
00:03:45,872 --> 00:03:47,574
I believe you.

16
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:49,478
Whoa. Duggan.

17
00:03:54,716 --> 00:03:55,683
Whoa.

18
00:03:56,783 --> 00:03:58,020
The hell?

19
00:04:03,192 --> 00:04:05,058
How the hell you figure
this wound up

20
00:04:05,092 --> 00:04:07,530
out here in the middle of
these grassland?

21
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:11,067
This will work out nice.

22
00:04:17,904 --> 00:04:19,673
Just cut me loose.

23
00:04:19,706 --> 00:04:21,742
You'll never see me again,
honest. Just cut me loose.

24
00:04:21,776 --> 00:04:23,677
Sit on up.

25
00:04:23,711 --> 00:04:25,879
Well, you see,
I would cut you loose,

26
00:04:25,913 --> 00:04:28,584
but that just violates
my sense of what's right.

27
00:05:13,927 --> 00:05:17,031
<i>It can be hard to tell
who and what a man is,</i>

28
00:05:17,064 --> 00:05:19,668
<i>he's got a mind
to convince you otherwise.</i>

29
00:05:21,601 --> 00:05:25,173
<i>My people were from New York,
where I was born.</i>

30
00:05:26,206 --> 00:05:28,108
<i>By the time I was three,</i>

31
00:05:28,141 --> 00:05:31,245
<i>we'd made it to
Coffeyville, Kansas,</i>

32
00:05:31,278 --> 00:05:36,250
<i>then down to Arizona,
then New Mexico.</i>

33
00:05:36,283 --> 00:05:39,019
<i>I was in Mexico
proper for a time.</i>

34
00:05:41,122 --> 00:05:43,759
<i>I've tried my hand at
many a vocation.</i>

35
00:05:46,627 --> 00:05:48,896
<i>Some more marginal
than others.</i>

36
00:05:57,137 --> 00:06:01,276
<i>Finally, I settled on the life
of a farmer.</i>

37
00:06:02,644 --> 00:06:04,079
<i>Which is what I am.</i>

38
00:06:51,024 --> 00:06:53,860
We got that hog, stock to feed,

39
00:06:53,894 --> 00:06:55,963
and a root cellar to fill.

40
00:06:55,997 --> 00:06:58,699
There's tractors can do this now
in quarter the time.

41
00:06:58,733 --> 00:07:00,701
Is that right?

42
00:07:00,735 --> 00:07:01,802
And here I thought

43
00:07:01,836 --> 00:07:03,906
farming was in
your bones, Wyatt.

44
00:07:06,072 --> 00:07:07,709
This would be a
good place for you

45
00:07:07,742 --> 00:07:09,211
to raise a family of your own.

46
00:07:09,242 --> 00:07:11,879
I know your ma would have
felt that way.

47
00:07:11,911 --> 00:07:13,081
I ain't her.

48
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,651
Or him.

49
00:07:16,685 --> 00:07:19,355
By wisdom is a house built,

50
00:07:19,387 --> 00:07:21,855
and through understanding
is it established.

51
00:07:22,723 --> 00:07:24,826
Through knowledge are
its rooms filled

52
00:07:24,858 --> 00:07:27,060
with rare and
beautiful treasures.

53
00:07:27,093 --> 00:07:30,331
And blessed are those hearts
that are set on pilgrimage.

54
00:07:32,266 --> 00:07:35,302
Much as I'd like to
stick around...

55
00:07:35,336 --> 00:07:37,872
listen to y'all quote Scripture
at each other...

56
00:07:38,406 --> 00:07:39,875
I'm goin' bird huntin'.

57
00:07:41,841 --> 00:07:43,745
Thanks for the help, Al.

58
00:07:44,411 --> 00:07:46,180
It does me good to be here.

59
00:07:47,747 --> 00:07:51,620
Makes me feel like I'm still
connected to Marie somehow.

60
00:07:52,853 --> 00:07:54,855
Give your uncle a hand
with his things.

61
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:57,925
That is, if you've had
sufficient respite.

62
00:08:17,177 --> 00:08:19,112
Thank you, son.

63
00:08:19,146 --> 00:08:20,081
Yes, sir.

64
00:08:20,113 --> 00:08:21,949
Yeah, I wanted to go huntin'
this mornin',

65
00:08:21,983 --> 00:08:24,153
but your pa said he
needed some help.

66
00:08:25,151 --> 00:08:27,221
Sure would like to go with you
one of these days.

67
00:08:27,254 --> 00:08:29,925
I don't think
that'd go over too well.

68
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:33,394
Your pa's a good man, Wyatt.

69
00:08:33,427 --> 00:08:35,697
I wouldn't let him
marry my sister

70
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,033
if I didn't think so.

71
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:41,436
Soon enough, you'll be able to

72
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:44,340
do all the travelin'
and shootin' you want to.

73
00:08:45,807 --> 00:08:47,341
Stop frettin' about it.

74
00:09:05,024 --> 00:09:08,096
We'll take two chops
for supper and smoke the rest.

75
00:09:08,797 --> 00:09:13,100
I ain't got time to render this.
Throw it in the pen.

76
00:09:32,385 --> 00:09:34,489
Don't it bother you sometimes,
they eat their own?

77
00:09:35,524 --> 00:09:37,993
Don't make no
difference to a hog.

78
00:09:52,874 --> 00:09:54,509
Why'd you settle here?

79
00:09:54,543 --> 00:09:56,144
What's that meant to mean?

80
00:09:57,411 --> 00:10:01,750
Why? Why the Territory,
of all places?

81
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,820
You could stake a claim,

82
00:10:04,851 --> 00:10:07,020
hang onto it for a year,
it was yours.

83
00:10:07,822 --> 00:10:09,990
Seemed like
a pretty good deal at the time.

84
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,297
Got here before the guns
went off, you know that.

85
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:18,032
I still don't believe
this is what you wanted.

86
00:10:19,567 --> 00:10:23,538
Up at dawn, feedin' the stock,
workin' the crops.

87
00:10:24,538 --> 00:10:26,274
Hot or cold, rain or shine.

88
00:10:26,307 --> 00:10:29,144
You'll discover
there's worse arrangements.

89
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:39,455
Pa?

90
00:11:20,595 --> 00:11:22,264
Easy, gal, that's it.

91
00:11:24,499 --> 00:11:26,869
Had me a mare near
just like this

92
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,369
when I wasn't much
older than you.

93
00:11:29,235 --> 00:11:30,370
Lookie here.

94
00:11:34,042 --> 00:11:36,979
What do you think happened?
Some kind of robbery?

95
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:39,113
- A shootout?
- Shut your nonsense.

96
00:11:40,447 --> 00:11:43,018
I'd best go look for the rider.

97
00:11:43,049 --> 00:11:44,985
Yeah, I'll go saddle up.

98
00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:48,121
You tend to this horse
and stay inside till I get back.

99
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,091
But what if it's trouble, Pa?
I can help you.

100
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,927
Go on. Do as I say.

101
00:14:01,654 --> 00:14:02,657
Hello.

102
00:15:55,701 --> 00:15:56,703
Nope.

103
00:17:16,316 --> 00:17:17,184
Wyatt!

104
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,255
- Is he alive?
- Barely.

105
00:17:21,288 --> 00:17:22,323
Was he alone?

106
00:17:23,724 --> 00:17:28,329
No, but I dispatched
with a dozen others was there.

107
00:17:28,362 --> 00:17:29,130
Give me a hand.

108
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:31,967
He's... he's lost a
lot of blood.

109
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,344
Is he gonna live?

110
00:17:42,376 --> 00:17:44,246
Be up to us, I suppose.

111
00:17:44,278 --> 00:17:46,346
Too far and too late
to fetch the doc.

112
00:17:47,047 --> 00:17:50,584
Well, I can go.
Ride all night if I have to.

113
00:17:50,617 --> 00:17:52,287
I'm sure you would.

114
00:17:53,887 --> 00:17:55,557
So?

115
00:17:55,589 --> 00:17:57,858
You'll stay right here.
Hand over that witch hazel.

116
00:18:05,432 --> 00:18:07,334
That is an outlaw.

117
00:18:07,367 --> 00:18:09,503
On the run, shot off his horse.

118
00:18:10,505 --> 00:18:11,705
You think he killed somebody?

119
00:18:11,738 --> 00:18:14,442
Wyatt, I know
just as much as you do.

120
00:18:15,442 --> 00:18:16,943
What's that for?

121
00:18:16,977 --> 00:18:19,948
Seal the wound tight
so he don't bleed out overnight.

122
00:18:21,381 --> 00:18:24,919
No! Don't never elevate
the feet with a chest wound.

123
00:18:34,328 --> 00:18:36,030
I've seen the scars
on your body.

124
00:18:36,063 --> 00:18:37,932
'Cause I ain't hid 'em from you.

125
00:18:38,932 --> 00:18:41,669
Now maybe you'll
understand your raisin'.

126
00:18:41,702 --> 00:18:43,038
Put your hand right here.

127
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:49,810
Where you goin'?

128
00:18:49,843 --> 00:18:52,279
Just keep applyin' pressure
till I get back.

129
00:21:40,948 --> 00:21:42,048
What now?

130
00:21:42,082 --> 00:21:45,519
Bullet's gotta come out.
And he won't make the ride.

131
00:21:46,953 --> 00:21:48,222
Half that rope.

132
00:22:01,001 --> 00:22:02,570
I'll fetch the doc.

133
00:22:03,904 --> 00:22:05,973
You'll stay here
and keep an eye on him.

134
00:22:13,146 --> 00:22:15,182
You really think
that's necessary?

135
00:22:15,215 --> 00:22:17,117
It ain't not necessary.

136
00:22:18,151 --> 00:22:20,153
Now, why don't you
cool his fever

137
00:22:20,186 --> 00:22:21,722
instead of vaporizin' on every

138
00:22:21,755 --> 00:22:23,557
thought that comes
into your head?

139
00:22:53,887 --> 00:22:55,055
Trail's cold.

140
00:22:59,626 --> 00:23:00,628
We'll get him.

141
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:32,226
That dog could track
a fish through water.

142
00:23:35,695 --> 00:23:36,698
Come on.

143
00:23:47,107 --> 00:23:49,210
He should come to,
you keep your distance.

144
00:23:49,242 --> 00:23:50,912
It don't matter he's tied up.

145
00:23:50,944 --> 00:23:52,646
I can handle myself

146
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:55,182
You just do as I say.
I'll be back soon as I can.

147
00:23:55,215 --> 00:23:56,217
Come on.

148
00:26:58,265 --> 00:26:59,433
Where's Billy at?

149
00:27:10,276 --> 00:27:13,279
<i>Keep your head down.
You'll be all right.</i>

150
00:28:25,351 --> 00:28:26,353
Whoa.

151
00:29:38,057 --> 00:29:39,259
He was here.

152
00:29:42,061 --> 00:29:43,663
Don't look like it to me.

153
00:29:52,605 --> 00:29:55,342
If I'm right, he weren't alone.

154
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:01,615
Whoever it is knows
what he's doin'.

155
00:30:05,451 --> 00:30:08,221
Covered his tracks as good
as anyone I've run across.

156
00:30:09,055 --> 00:30:11,358
Weren't for this rain,
I'd have found him sooner.

157
00:30:12,226 --> 00:30:14,996
I don't need you
to speechify the inner workings

158
00:30:15,028 --> 00:30:17,096
in your halfwit canine mind.

159
00:30:18,332 --> 00:30:19,967
I need to know where
he's headed.

160
00:30:25,104 --> 00:30:27,307
Well, that don't exactly
narrow it down.

161
00:32:16,616 --> 00:32:18,086
Where am I?

162
00:32:24,423 --> 00:32:25,491
Who the hell are you?

163
00:32:26,626 --> 00:32:29,262
M-My pa found you,
close to dead.

164
00:32:29,295 --> 00:32:30,763
He brought you back here.

165
00:32:30,796 --> 00:32:32,432
Oh, yeah?

166
00:32:32,465 --> 00:32:34,200
Who's your pa?

167
00:32:34,233 --> 00:32:35,236
Nobody. Uh...

168
00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:37,337
Henry. Just a-a farmer.

169
00:32:50,449 --> 00:32:52,285
What, it's only you
and him here?

170
00:32:54,921 --> 00:32:56,256
He here now?

171
00:32:59,659 --> 00:33:00,794
He's just out back.

172
00:33:03,462 --> 00:33:05,133
Tendin' to the hogs.

173
00:33:06,967 --> 00:33:08,268
Oh, yeah?

174
00:33:12,471 --> 00:33:13,640
Well, go fetch him.

175
00:33:27,954 --> 00:33:29,689
Quit mov... moving!

176
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:32,659
Right now, I don't
want to hurt you.

177
00:33:32,692 --> 00:33:34,359
I don't want to hurt you.
Stop moving!

178
00:33:34,393 --> 00:33:37,297
Where'd you put my gun
and my satchel? Listen to me!

179
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:38,798
I don't know what
you're talkin' about, mister.

180
00:33:38,832 --> 00:33:39,766
Don't you lie to me!

181
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:42,169
What'd you do
with my gun and my satchel?

182
00:34:09,896 --> 00:34:11,364
Pa!

183
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:17,503
How'd he get loose?

184
00:34:17,536 --> 00:34:18,739
H-He wriggled free.

185
00:34:19,438 --> 00:34:20,873
Wriggled free?

186
00:34:20,907 --> 00:34:23,878
And got hold of my knife
I left on the bedstand.

187
00:34:24,976 --> 00:34:26,847
Well, that's on the both of us.

188
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,483
Help me tie the son of a
bitch back up.

189
00:34:59,911 --> 00:35:00,914
Okay.

190
00:35:02,916 --> 00:35:05,784
You better think long and hard
on what you got yourself into.

191
00:35:05,818 --> 00:35:08,655
Funny, I was about
to tell you the same thing.

192
00:35:11,389 --> 00:35:12,927
What you aimin' to do with that?

193
00:35:13,793 --> 00:35:16,663
Gonna dig that
bullet out of you,

194
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:18,764
maybe get some answers
in the process.

195
00:35:19,465 --> 00:35:21,034
I like what I hear,

196
00:35:21,068 --> 00:35:24,371
I might be inclined to give you
something to ease the pain.

197
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:32,911
No.

198
00:35:33,914 --> 00:35:34,947
No!

199
00:35:35,947 --> 00:35:37,784
Okay! Listen, listen!

200
00:35:37,818 --> 00:35:39,452
No!

201
00:35:39,485 --> 00:35:41,621
Let's start with you
tellin' me who you are.

202
00:35:41,655 --> 00:35:44,456
I'm law!
I'm a goddamn lawman!

203
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:48,494
He ain't no lawman, Pa,
he was fixin' to kill me.

204
00:35:48,527 --> 00:35:49,963
Ready for some whisky?

205
00:35:49,996 --> 00:35:52,565
I just told you... I'm law.

206
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,369
Ask him about the money.

207
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:58,871
What money?

208
00:35:59,606 --> 00:36:00,840
He asked me about it.

209
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,775
Listen. Listen to me.

210
00:36:03,809 --> 00:36:04,811
Okay, listen.

211
00:36:05,978 --> 00:36:07,914
What's a shot lawman doin'
with a satchel full of cash?

212
00:36:07,947 --> 00:36:09,681
Listen!

213
00:36:09,715 --> 00:36:11,684
Listen! If you got a
brain in your head,

214
00:36:11,717 --> 00:36:13,552
you need to get
yourself and your boy

215
00:36:13,585 --> 00:36:15,021
out of here fast as you can.

216
00:36:15,054 --> 00:36:16,489
You hear me?

217
00:36:21,594 --> 00:36:22,628
No.

218
00:36:22,661 --> 00:36:24,764
Oh, no! No, no!

219
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:42,115
At least we know you won't die

220
00:36:42,148 --> 00:36:44,451
'fore I find out what I
want to know.

221
00:36:51,824 --> 00:36:52,960
Oh God.

222
00:36:56,496 --> 00:36:57,831
Let me have a little more.

223
00:36:57,862 --> 00:36:59,931
Let me...

224
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:04,572
Riders.

225
00:37:09,543 --> 00:37:12,579
Come on, cut me loose.
Come on, cut me loose.

226
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:17,516
Listen, they gon' be
three of 'em.

227
00:37:18,516 --> 00:37:21,420
One's a Mexican.

228
00:37:21,454 --> 00:37:23,889
The other's an ugly
son of a bitch

229
00:37:23,922 --> 00:37:25,626
with a thick beard.

230
00:37:25,659 --> 00:37:26,793
And their leader...

231
00:37:28,027 --> 00:37:29,764
their leader looks like a man
you don't want to mess with.

232
00:37:30,197 --> 00:37:32,465
And believe me, you don't.

233
00:37:32,498 --> 00:37:34,034
Keep back from the window.

234
00:37:35,534 --> 00:37:37,170
If you want to live,
you gotta turn me loose

235
00:37:37,204 --> 00:37:38,472
and give me my gun, hear?

236
00:37:39,737 --> 00:37:40,773
He's lyin'.

237
00:37:40,806 --> 00:37:42,809
I said keep back.

238
00:37:42,842 --> 00:37:43,911
Go on.

239
00:38:38,797 --> 00:38:40,099
Can I help you?

240
00:38:40,733 --> 00:38:42,268
I'm Sheriff Sam Ketchum.

241
00:38:42,302 --> 00:38:44,003
These here are my deputies.

242
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,907
We've been scoutin'
for a man on the run.

243
00:38:46,938 --> 00:38:49,476
Lately goes by the
name of Curry.

244
00:38:50,543 --> 00:38:51,844
Been shot.

245
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:56,516
Six foot, brown hair,
said to be handsome,

246
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:58,050
though most would
want him credited

247
00:38:58,083 --> 00:38:59,152
for nothing but devilry.

248
00:39:01,286 --> 00:39:04,724
What I do know is,
he's dangerous.

249
00:39:05,224 --> 00:39:07,760
You seen anybody around here
answers that description?

250
00:39:08,628 --> 00:39:12,130
Say you're a sheriff?
How's it I don't recognize you?

251
00:39:12,731 --> 00:39:14,735
We're from way over
in Woods County.

252
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:17,137
Now, this Curry we're
looking for,

253
00:39:17,168 --> 00:39:18,639
he's got a warrant on him there

254
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,840
in Missouri and Tennessee.

255
00:39:21,706 --> 00:39:24,043
Might also claim he's the law.

256
00:39:24,744 --> 00:39:26,780
He's got a history of
such chicanery.

257
00:39:27,646 --> 00:39:30,851
Far from it. He's a killer.

258
00:39:30,882 --> 00:39:32,619
He will kill again.

259
00:39:35,155 --> 00:39:36,255
You're not fixin' to shoot

260
00:39:36,289 --> 00:39:38,056
any of us with that pistol,
are you?

261
00:39:39,726 --> 00:39:41,793
So far I got no reason to.

262
00:39:43,128 --> 00:39:44,130
That's good news.

263
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:52,237
You'll want to think 'fore you
raise that thing up, farmer.

264
00:39:52,271 --> 00:39:54,673
Nothing to be
worried about here, friend.

265
00:39:54,706 --> 00:39:57,210
Just a little project
I'm working on, that's all.

266
00:39:59,612 --> 00:40:01,181
How many people live out here?

267
00:40:02,947 --> 00:40:04,351
What difference is that to you?

268
00:40:04,382 --> 00:40:07,353
I'm trying to make sure
you're safe, is all.

269
00:40:07,387 --> 00:40:09,121
Wouldn't seem to be
your business,

270
00:40:09,155 --> 00:40:11,757
seeing as how you're
from Woods County.

271
00:40:12,925 --> 00:40:14,927
You married?

272
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,664
Saw a grave over there.

273
00:40:19,063 --> 00:40:20,065
My wife.

274
00:40:20,967 --> 00:40:23,969
Died ten years back
from tuberculosis.

275
00:40:26,106 --> 00:40:27,173
My condolences.

276
00:40:29,675 --> 00:40:31,210
Horrible way to go.

277
00:40:31,244 --> 00:40:33,713
Tell 'em, Pa. Tell 'em!

278
00:40:33,746 --> 00:40:36,250
Marie Hobbs McCarty,
the marker said.

279
00:40:36,983 --> 00:40:39,052
Your last name McCarty?

280
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:40,119
That's right.

281
00:40:41,219 --> 00:40:42,590
First name?

282
00:40:46,358 --> 00:40:47,626
Henry.

283
00:40:49,996 --> 00:40:51,931
So Hobbs was her people,
I'm guessing.

284
00:40:52,697 --> 00:40:55,302
'Cause I noticed a Hobbs ranch
to the east of here.

285
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:56,603
Her brothers.

286
00:40:57,704 --> 00:40:58,737
Uh-huh.

287
00:41:01,005 --> 00:41:02,242
Well, from the looks of things,

288
00:41:02,275 --> 00:41:04,010
you've been out here a
good many years.

289
00:41:06,246 --> 00:41:07,614
Nice situation.

290
00:41:08,414 --> 00:41:10,750
All nestled up here
in the hills.

291
00:41:10,784 --> 00:41:12,217
Hard to see from a distance.

292
00:41:13,418 --> 00:41:16,657
What's any of this got to do
with the man you're lookin' for?

293
00:41:17,755 --> 00:41:19,159
Not much, I'll grant you.

294
00:41:22,695 --> 00:41:24,398
Long time ago, uh...

295
00:41:24,429 --> 00:41:29,034
was a fella caused some trouble
down Arizona, New Mexico way.

296
00:41:30,034 --> 00:41:31,838
Heard he went by the
name McCarty.

297
00:41:33,938 --> 00:41:35,842
I was wondering if he
might be your kin.

298
00:41:36,909 --> 00:41:39,313
You got the wrong
pig by the ear.

299
00:41:40,112 --> 00:41:41,014
Meaning?

300
00:41:41,047 --> 00:41:44,818
I don't know no McCartys
anywhere but here,

301
00:41:44,851 --> 00:41:46,918
and all my kin is deceased.

302
00:41:48,755 --> 00:41:50,755
Now I got chores to tend to

303
00:41:50,789 --> 00:41:53,391
and scant wood to
cook my supper.

304
00:41:53,425 --> 00:41:56,027
I ain't seen the man
you're after.

305
00:41:56,061 --> 00:41:58,030
I'll keep my eyes peeled.

306
00:41:58,864 --> 00:42:00,699
Be sure to alert the
good Sheriff

307
00:42:00,733 --> 00:42:02,936
in Chickasha if I should
run across him.

308
00:42:06,304 --> 00:42:07,306
Well, then.

309
00:42:08,742 --> 00:42:09,943
I thank you for your help.

310
00:42:12,445 --> 00:42:14,414
Looks like another dead end,
boys.

311
00:42:16,949 --> 00:42:18,952
You be sure to lock your
doors tonight.

312
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:22,956
Stay safe.

313
00:42:26,824 --> 00:42:27,927
Come on.

314
00:42:50,081 --> 00:42:51,851
Now you're inclined to
hang onto that?

315
00:42:51,885 --> 00:42:53,119
I thought you might be needin'
help.

316
00:42:53,152 --> 00:42:54,920
You wanna tell me how
this got fired?

317
00:42:55,853 --> 00:42:57,157
Honest, Pa.

318
00:42:57,188 --> 00:42:58,324
Don't you lie to me!

319
00:42:59,525 --> 00:43:02,228
I wanted to know what it's like.

320
00:43:02,262 --> 00:43:07,032
I am the only boy for 50 miles
that's never fired one.

321
00:43:07,065 --> 00:43:09,400
You won't even let me
lay hand on your old shotgun.

322
00:43:09,434 --> 00:43:13,105
So if you can't teach me proper,
I gotta do it myself.

323
00:43:13,139 --> 00:43:17,476
You get into my things again,
I will crack your crust!

324
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:22,248
You're a stupid,
worthless old man.

325
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,217
A whole life, and nothin'
to show for it

326
00:43:25,251 --> 00:43:26,887
but this rundown old farm

327
00:43:26,918 --> 00:43:28,954
and a boy who's gonna
leave you alone to die

328
00:43:28,987 --> 00:43:30,858
as soon as he's able.

329
00:43:43,436 --> 00:43:44,771
Let me guess.

330
00:43:45,237 --> 00:43:46,907
You gon' tell me that he ain't

331
00:43:46,938 --> 00:43:49,074
the sheriff of Woods County,
you are.

332
00:43:49,108 --> 00:43:51,543
They ain't lawmen,
they're bank robbers.

333
00:43:51,577 --> 00:43:53,780
Well, what's left of them,
anyway.

334
00:43:55,914 --> 00:43:59,083
Knocked over the Adams Express.

335
00:43:59,117 --> 00:44:01,152
Me and my deputies gave chase,
killed two of 'em,

336
00:44:01,186 --> 00:44:02,554
including the one
carrying the loot.

337
00:44:02,588 --> 00:44:04,523
Bank robbers wearin' badges?

338
00:44:04,556 --> 00:44:06,193
That they took off
me and my men.

339
00:44:07,193 --> 00:44:08,927
He's the one
impersonating the law.

340
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:12,331
But you made off with the money.

341
00:44:14,266 --> 00:44:15,469
Hell, yeah, I grabbed it.

342
00:44:17,202 --> 00:44:20,005
Then why ain't you back with it
in Woods County?

343
00:44:20,472 --> 00:44:24,076
Oh, I don't know.
Why does it look like?

344
00:44:27,213 --> 00:44:28,280
And my first priority was

345
00:44:28,313 --> 00:44:30,050
getting away from
that bunch alive.

346
00:44:30,081 --> 00:44:32,083
That's why I rode like hell
till I couldn't no more.

347
00:44:32,619 --> 00:44:34,152
There's the last thing
I remembered,

348
00:44:34,186 --> 00:44:35,487
till I woke up here.

349
00:44:37,456 --> 00:44:38,556
Look, I know what I'm saying

350
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:40,125
sounds ridiculous to
you and all.

351
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:41,360
That it does.

352
00:44:41,393 --> 00:44:42,896
Why they didn't shoot you dead

353
00:44:42,927 --> 00:44:44,496
on the spot just now,
I don't know.

354
00:44:45,496 --> 00:44:47,199
But I can guarantee you...

355
00:44:48,333 --> 00:44:49,902
they'll be back.

356
00:45:44,289 --> 00:45:46,190
Only thing I can't figure

357
00:45:46,224 --> 00:45:47,259
is why the old man

358
00:45:47,293 --> 00:45:49,463
would risk his neck
for a stranger.

359
00:45:50,161 --> 00:45:52,231
Maybe he got offered a
cut of the money.

360
00:45:53,632 --> 00:45:55,302
Something tells me
that ain't it.

361
00:45:57,570 --> 00:45:59,438
Any one of us could have
taken him out.

362
00:46:00,405 --> 00:46:02,240
Which is what we should do now.

363
00:46:02,275 --> 00:46:06,112
- Ride up, finish it.
- Not just yet.

364
00:46:09,447 --> 00:46:11,650
'Cause of some shaky old farmer?

365
00:46:11,684 --> 00:46:15,420
He didn't hold that pistol
like any farmer I've ever seen.

366
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:18,190
There are three of us.

367
00:46:19,224 --> 00:46:22,393
We don't run up in a bank,
or ride up on a stage

368
00:46:22,427 --> 00:46:23,929
without knowing who's in it.

369
00:46:24,429 --> 00:46:27,400
We know Curry's in there.
With our money!

370
00:46:27,431 --> 00:46:29,101
Which is why you're
going to reconnoiter

371
00:46:29,135 --> 00:46:31,536
that so-called farmer's place

372
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:33,304
and make sure Curry
don't skedaddle.

373
00:46:33,338 --> 00:46:35,206
Gladly.

374
00:46:36,608 --> 00:46:38,677
Don't make a move till
we get there.

375
00:46:40,344 --> 00:46:41,213
Fine.

376
00:46:42,782 --> 00:46:45,052
- Duggan.
- I said fine.

377
00:46:53,092 --> 00:46:56,262
Come sunup, you and me
will head into Chickasha,

378
00:46:56,293 --> 00:46:57,563
hire some guns.

379
00:46:58,362 --> 00:46:59,599
Understood.

380
00:47:01,132 --> 00:47:05,103
On the way, we'll pay a call
on Farmer Hobbs...

381
00:47:05,737 --> 00:47:07,673
find out if he's got
anything interesting

382
00:47:07,706 --> 00:47:10,576
to tell us about ol'
Henry McCarty.

383
00:48:12,438 --> 00:48:15,175
Wyatt.
Come on in.

384
00:48:17,141 --> 00:48:19,512
- I'm almost finished.
- Leave it till morning.

385
00:48:21,847 --> 00:48:22,715
Come on.

386
00:48:53,612 --> 00:48:56,581
It'd be a damn sight easier
if I could feed myself.

387
00:48:59,452 --> 00:49:02,222
Be a damn sight easier
not to feed you at all.

388
00:49:18,905 --> 00:49:21,775
- You and me ever met?
- That I'd remember.

389
00:49:24,643 --> 00:49:26,213
How long you been a sheriff?

390
00:49:30,382 --> 00:49:35,255
- I'd say onto 18 years now.
- How'd you get your start?

391
00:49:36,188 --> 00:49:38,190
I was a deputy for Big
Bill Thompson

392
00:49:38,224 --> 00:49:39,257
in Baxter Springs.

393
00:49:40,193 --> 00:49:44,295
Baxter Springs.
Baxter Springs, Missouri?

394
00:49:45,664 --> 00:49:49,235
- Kansas.
- Skinny fella, big ears?

395
00:49:51,603 --> 00:49:52,871
Heavyset.

396
00:49:52,905 --> 00:49:54,840
Missing part of his
left ear from

397
00:49:54,873 --> 00:49:57,342
a drunk miner taking a
potshot at him.

398
00:49:57,376 --> 00:50:00,813
- I heard it was a drunk whore.
- Oh, you did?

399
00:50:03,547 --> 00:50:05,751
Which part of Baxter Springs
you live in?

400
00:50:07,619 --> 00:50:11,356
A boarding house.
Out near Grant's Stage Station.

401
00:50:11,389 --> 00:50:13,159
What was the landlady's name?

402
00:50:14,693 --> 00:50:16,528
She weren't no lady.

403
00:50:18,231 --> 00:50:20,534
She a nasty ol' cuss
named Hannah.

404
00:50:23,235 --> 00:50:25,903
You ever run into a
George Crook?

405
00:50:25,938 --> 00:50:28,306
You mean General George?

406
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,275
Sumbitch dedicated his life

407
00:50:30,309 --> 00:50:32,445
to driving the Caddo out
of the Territory.

408
00:50:50,963 --> 00:50:53,867
How in the hell did you end up
in Baxter Springs?

409
00:50:55,735 --> 00:50:57,902
Well, like every other fool

410
00:50:57,936 --> 00:51:00,271
dreaming of easy riches
and digging for tin.

411
00:51:00,972 --> 00:51:02,608
Till I realized there
weren't none.

412
00:51:03,409 --> 00:51:04,943
Just a bunch of ghost stories
about a mine

413
00:51:04,976 --> 00:51:06,579
near Smokey Hill River.

414
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:09,215
Then I... I was broke.
Work was hard to come by.

415
00:51:09,614 --> 00:51:11,751
I'm lucky Big Bill took
a liking to me.

416
00:51:11,784 --> 00:51:15,353
Otherwise I... I don't know
what would have come of me.

417
00:51:18,757 --> 00:51:21,460
I... I'm sorry I jumped
your boy before.

418
00:51:23,295 --> 00:51:25,864
I woke up in a strange place,
didn't know who he was...

419
00:51:26,498 --> 00:51:29,001
I was being held hostage
in some hideout.

420
00:51:29,034 --> 00:51:31,371
This look like a hideout to you?

421
00:51:33,905 --> 00:51:35,909
I overheard what he
said earlier.

422
00:51:36,909 --> 00:51:38,643
He didn't mean any of that.

423
00:51:40,512 --> 00:51:41,614
Yes, he did.

424
00:51:58,097 --> 00:52:02,400
I'll give you one hand free.
Don't make me take it off.

425
00:52:02,833 --> 00:52:03,869
All right.

426
00:52:09,641 --> 00:52:11,010
All right.

427
00:52:30,963 --> 00:52:32,797
Was farming what your daddy did?

428
00:52:33,797 --> 00:52:37,302
My daddy died when I was 3,
up in Kansas.

429
00:52:38,103 --> 00:52:40,773
And he did near everything
but work the land.

430
00:52:42,139 --> 00:52:43,976
I was orphaned at 15.

431
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:47,981
That's 13 years longer
than I knew my folks.

432
00:52:49,447 --> 00:52:51,817
Ah. Whereabouts you grow up?

433
00:52:53,851 --> 00:52:54,853
New Mexico.

434
00:52:56,454 --> 00:52:58,489
- Which part?
- Fort Sumner.

435
00:52:58,523 --> 00:53:00,326
Born and raised.
You heard of it?

436
00:53:05,429 --> 00:53:07,498
Where Billy the Kid was shot,
wasn't it?

437
00:53:09,802 --> 00:53:11,603
Main reason anyone know it.

438
00:53:17,041 --> 00:53:18,876
I was there the night
it happened.

439
00:53:22,614 --> 00:53:23,949
How's that?

440
00:53:23,983 --> 00:53:25,985
I was just a boy.

441
00:53:26,016 --> 00:53:27,152
I used to make what
money I could

442
00:53:27,186 --> 00:53:30,621
doing chores for a fella
by the name of Peter Maxwell.

443
00:53:31,121 --> 00:53:33,891
Same Peter Maxwell
put the Kid up for the night.

444
00:53:33,925 --> 00:53:35,659
Same Peter Maxwell
tipped off Garrett

445
00:53:35,693 --> 00:53:37,461
and his deputies, Poe
and McKinney,

446
00:53:37,496 --> 00:53:39,130
the Kid was holed up there.

447
00:53:39,164 --> 00:53:40,831
I was sweeping the stalls.

448
00:53:40,864 --> 00:53:43,469
When I saw Garrett walk in
the house, I...

449
00:53:44,034 --> 00:53:45,438
I don't think nothing of it.

450
00:53:46,905 --> 00:53:50,409
But Billy wasn't in there.
Not then, leastways.

451
00:53:50,443 --> 00:53:52,445
- Know how I know?
- How?

452
00:53:52,476 --> 00:53:54,045
He was barefoot
in his shin sleeves,

453
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:55,746
cutting the meat off
a deer carcass

454
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:57,615
not 20 feet from where
I was working.

455
00:54:02,188 --> 00:54:03,956
I saw him peer through
the barn door,

456
00:54:03,987 --> 00:54:06,391
and he saw Poe and McKinney
on the porch there.

457
00:54:07,726 --> 00:54:10,530
He stopped carving,
looked me dead in my eye.

458
00:54:10,563 --> 00:54:14,166
He said, "Keep your head down,
you'll be all right."

459
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,668
So Billy went straight to
Maxwell's room,

460
00:54:17,702 --> 00:54:20,407
realized pretty quick
it ain't just Maxwell in there.

461
00:54:22,072 --> 00:54:25,543
He called out,
<i>"¿Quien es? ¿Quien es?"</i>

462
00:54:25,577 --> 00:54:27,880
'Cause Billy spoke Spanish
as good as a Mexican.

463
00:54:29,047 --> 00:54:30,916
Pat's answer?

464
00:54:31,684 --> 00:54:35,954
Two shots. One wide of the mark,
and the other one in the chest.

465
00:54:40,659 --> 00:54:42,427
That was the end of
Billy the Kid.

466
00:54:45,764 --> 00:54:47,632
And you seen it all.

467
00:54:47,666 --> 00:54:49,034
I most certainly did.

468
00:54:49,068 --> 00:54:50,869
Saw the Kid's body get
hauled off too,

469
00:54:50,902 --> 00:54:52,105
wrapped in a bloody sheet.

470
00:54:53,972 --> 00:54:55,907
Enough to teach me
that ain't no life for me.

471
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:58,844
I'd rather stop this crazy
than be part of it anyway.

472
00:55:24,235 --> 00:55:25,637
Well...

473
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:27,172
Damn.

474
00:55:27,206 --> 00:55:29,041
If I knew all it took
was a good story

475
00:55:29,072 --> 00:55:30,275
for you to cut me loose.

476
00:55:33,012 --> 00:55:35,547
You well enough to stay upright
in the saddle?

477
00:55:37,614 --> 00:55:39,885
- Not hardly.
- I want you out of here.

478
00:55:40,686 --> 00:55:43,121
I suppose waiting till sunup
ain't an option?

479
00:55:43,155 --> 00:55:45,657
If I was alone out here,
it'd be different.

480
00:55:46,291 --> 00:55:47,893
Well, then, I guess I'm ready.

481
00:55:50,061 --> 00:55:50,963
Good.

482
00:55:54,766 --> 00:55:55,635
Take it.

483
00:56:01,572 --> 00:56:02,775
I'll fetch your loot.

484
00:56:38,342 --> 00:56:40,146
- Pa?
- Wyatt! Get down!

485
00:56:43,748 --> 00:56:44,817
I-I think I'm all right.

486
00:56:46,952 --> 00:56:47,985
Is... is he hit?

487
00:56:55,693 --> 00:56:58,230
He just passed out.
Give me that.

488
00:56:59,364 --> 00:57:01,099
I'm better with it
than you think.

489
00:57:01,132 --> 00:57:03,001
Not until I teach you proper.

490
00:57:03,034 --> 00:57:04,836
- I've taught myself
- Shush.

491
00:57:06,371 --> 00:57:07,840
Now, where'd
you get to?

492
00:57:15,079 --> 00:57:16,614
- He's under the house.
- Shh.

493
00:57:50,282 --> 00:57:52,150
I hope you got
good enough with this.

494
00:57:54,152 --> 00:57:56,255
God forbid it happens,
but shooting a man

495
00:57:56,286 --> 00:57:58,322
is different than
hitting a target...

496
00:57:58,356 --> 00:58:00,793
a line you can't
cross back over.

497
00:58:00,824 --> 00:58:01,626
I know that.

498
00:58:01,659 --> 00:58:03,329
You couldn't until
you've done it.

499
00:58:05,429 --> 00:58:06,797
If he comes in here...

500
00:58:07,831 --> 00:58:09,101
you pull that trigger.

501
00:58:10,869 --> 00:58:12,237
Aim for the chest.

502
00:58:12,271 --> 00:58:15,172
And keep firing
until you hit it.

503
00:58:38,764 --> 00:58:40,931
Where you going?

504
00:58:55,813 --> 00:58:57,182
Son of a bitch!

505
00:58:57,815 --> 00:58:58,951
Cocksucker!

506
00:58:59,418 --> 00:59:01,186
Fuck.

507
00:59:08,458 --> 00:59:09,960
Shit.

508
00:59:38,922 --> 00:59:42,226
Where's the others? They close?

509
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:43,496
Go to hell.

510
00:59:44,896 --> 00:59:46,331
I've been here
too often to let

511
00:59:46,364 --> 00:59:49,333
a man of your caliber
overhaul my baggage.

512
00:59:51,268 --> 00:59:54,072
Answer me, or it ends for
you right now.

513
00:59:55,474 --> 00:59:57,074
Go to hell,
you bastard.

514
01:00:57,034 --> 01:00:58,871
He was fixin' to kill us both.

515
01:01:01,472 --> 01:01:02,541
I saw.

516
01:01:03,876 --> 01:01:06,077
Probably here to watch
and got greedy.

517
01:01:07,177 --> 01:01:09,181
The others will be coming.

518
01:01:12,382 --> 01:01:14,485
First thing, we gotta get rid
of this body.

519
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,389
How we gonna do that?

520
01:01:22,494 --> 01:01:23,929
We ain't.

521
01:02:22,521 --> 01:02:24,523
I know it don't
feel like it.

522
01:02:25,322 --> 01:02:27,425
You're lucky it just grazed ya.

523
01:02:31,697 --> 01:02:34,233
If you know I found that gun,

524
01:02:34,264 --> 01:02:36,902
you know I saw what's
in the back of that closet.

525
01:02:39,371 --> 01:02:40,338
Who are you?

526
01:02:42,505 --> 01:02:43,641
I'm who I am.

527
01:02:45,242 --> 01:02:48,146
Aren't you always preaching
about being honest?

528
01:02:48,713 --> 01:02:50,614
The truth will set you free?

529
01:02:53,318 --> 01:02:54,920
I've never lied to you.

530
01:03:03,661 --> 01:03:05,297
Isn't not telling me
the whole story

531
01:03:05,329 --> 01:03:06,563
the same damn thing?

532
01:03:12,603 --> 01:03:15,407
I've done things
I wish I could take back.

533
01:03:16,306 --> 01:03:19,077
A long time before you.
Before your ma.

534
01:03:20,610 --> 01:03:23,181
Things that
you got no business hearing.

535
01:03:24,315 --> 01:03:27,452
How am I supposed to respect you
if you ain't respecting me?

536
01:03:27,485 --> 01:03:29,487
I am respecting you.

537
01:03:30,722 --> 01:03:32,456
And if you don't
understand that,

538
01:03:32,489 --> 01:03:34,360
you ain't heard a
word I just said.

539
01:03:35,494 --> 01:03:39,063
No, I heard it. I just
don't believe a bit of it.

540
01:04:16,266 --> 01:04:17,402
<i>Keep your head down.</i>

541
01:04:21,639 --> 01:04:25,208
Keep your head down.
You'll be all right.

542
01:04:25,242 --> 01:04:26,277
<i>You'll be all right.</i>

543
01:06:25,329 --> 01:06:26,764
Whoa.

544
01:06:34,905 --> 01:06:36,673
- Morning
- Morning.

545
01:06:37,809 --> 01:06:40,677
- Something I can help you with?
- I sure hope so.

546
01:06:42,246 --> 01:06:45,851
Nice place you got here.
Peaceful. Quiet.

547
01:06:48,418 --> 01:06:49,521
Bird hunting.

548
01:06:50,454 --> 01:06:52,757
Nothing quite like the
flush of the bevy.

549
01:06:54,659 --> 01:06:56,161
You must be quite the shot.

550
01:06:58,563 --> 01:06:59,664
Do what I can.

551
01:07:00,664 --> 01:07:01,833
I envy you.

552
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:04,503
I don't get to go out hunting

553
01:07:04,534 --> 01:07:05,938
as much as I'd like
to these days.

554
01:07:07,438 --> 01:07:08,907
Something I can help
you with, mister?

555
01:07:11,507 --> 01:07:13,411
My daddy used to hunt pheasant.

556
01:07:13,978 --> 01:07:16,447
It was always
my damn job to clean 'em.

557
01:07:18,315 --> 01:07:21,387
Oh, cutting the skin on
the breast, peeling it back.

558
01:07:22,987 --> 01:07:25,423
But over time, I
figured the best way

559
01:07:25,456 --> 01:07:27,458
to get rid of their innards...

560
01:07:28,592 --> 01:07:32,463
was to split the bird's back.
Get to 'em that way.

561
01:07:35,467 --> 01:07:36,766
Is that what you find?

562
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,202
Look, I don't...

563
01:07:38,768 --> 01:07:40,605
mean to be un-neighborly, but...

564
01:07:41,005 --> 01:07:43,641
But get to the point? Sure.

565
01:07:45,876 --> 01:07:47,978
I wanted to ask you a
couple questions about, uh,

566
01:07:48,012 --> 01:07:49,914
your brother-in-law.

567
01:07:51,581 --> 01:07:53,351
Well, what concern is
he of yours?

568
01:07:54,485 --> 01:07:56,221
That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

569
01:07:57,353 --> 01:07:59,456
You see, I got this
crazy idea...

570
01:08:00,456 --> 01:08:01,860
there might be more to ol'
McCarty

571
01:08:01,891 --> 01:08:02,793
than meets the eye.

572
01:08:03,996 --> 01:08:05,831
You supposed be some
kind of lawman or something?

573
01:08:06,563 --> 01:08:08,300
Something like that.

574
01:08:09,367 --> 01:08:10,969
Well, I think it's
time you left.

575
01:08:11,735 --> 01:08:13,771
Well, we came here for
some answers.

576
01:08:15,806 --> 01:08:17,876
We ain't leaving till I get 'em.

577
01:08:17,908 --> 01:08:19,244
That so?

578
01:08:23,881 --> 01:08:25,516
I should...

579
01:08:30,054 --> 01:08:33,291
Now how the hell
we gonna pick his ass up?

580
01:08:42,733 --> 01:08:45,903
Okay. Okay, thank you.

581
01:09:00,384 --> 01:09:02,485
Oh, God. Okay.

582
01:09:02,519 --> 01:09:06,056
I'm no good to travel. I'm not.

583
01:09:07,725 --> 01:09:09,427
You take the boy,
you get out of here.

584
01:09:10,661 --> 01:09:11,828
When Ketchum and his men arrive,

585
01:09:11,862 --> 01:09:13,498
I'll hold them off as
long as I can.

586
01:09:14,398 --> 01:09:16,034
- The hell with that!
- Wyatt.

587
01:09:17,034 --> 01:09:18,671
We got guns.

588
01:09:19,403 --> 01:09:21,472
You already killed one of
them barehanded.

589
01:09:21,505 --> 01:09:24,375
Fill a pack. We're leaving.

590
01:09:25,909 --> 01:09:27,578
I'm warning you.

591
01:09:55,005 --> 01:09:56,507
He's back.

592
01:10:06,550 --> 01:10:07,384
Leave the rest.

593
01:10:07,418 --> 01:10:09,520
We can't just leave
him here to die.

594
01:10:09,554 --> 01:10:10,855
I am damn sure not
gonna lose you

595
01:10:10,887 --> 01:10:12,655
over something that
ain't our fight.

596
01:10:12,689 --> 01:10:13,891
Your pa's right.

597
01:10:13,923 --> 01:10:15,826
I am old enough to make
my own decisions,

598
01:10:15,859 --> 01:10:17,828
whether you are ready
to accept that or not.

599
01:10:17,862 --> 01:10:20,564
Yeah.
This is mine to finish.

600
01:10:20,597 --> 01:10:22,033
Go on, now. I'll be all right.

601
01:10:54,530 --> 01:10:55,399
Whoa.

602
01:10:59,170 --> 01:11:02,640
Curry!
Anybody home?

603
01:11:04,074 --> 01:11:06,077
You gentlemen
need something?

604
01:11:07,077 --> 01:11:08,913
We're here for our fugitive.

605
01:11:09,546 --> 01:11:11,783
I told you yesterday
I ain't seen him.

606
01:11:12,983 --> 01:11:15,653
My intuition tells
me that's not true.

607
01:11:17,087 --> 01:11:18,789
I'll make it easy...

608
01:11:18,822 --> 01:11:21,926
you hand him over,
we let you and the boy go free.

609
01:11:23,193 --> 01:11:26,530
The other option is,
we take him.

610
01:11:26,563 --> 01:11:28,132
And you and the boy die.

611
01:11:29,567 --> 01:11:31,636
You take that deal.

612
01:11:31,668 --> 01:11:33,572
I signed up for this,
you didn't.

613
01:11:38,242 --> 01:11:40,610
See your horses
are already saddled.

614
01:11:40,644 --> 01:11:42,847
You can just ride on
out of here.

615
01:11:47,851 --> 01:11:49,621
You and I both know
we'll be dead

616
01:11:49,653 --> 01:11:50,988
before we mount our horses.

617
01:11:54,224 --> 01:11:57,561
'Fore this turns
into some kinda brigasee,

618
01:11:57,594 --> 01:11:59,797
why don't me and you
settle this,

619
01:11:59,829 --> 01:12:01,097
knuckle and skull.

620
01:12:04,001 --> 01:12:06,204
You got a lot of fight
for a farmer.

621
01:12:07,271 --> 01:12:09,140
That ain't the way
this plays out.

622
01:12:11,208 --> 01:12:12,478
Bring him up!

623
01:12:25,088 --> 01:12:26,158
Al?

624
01:12:52,182 --> 01:12:54,051
Listen to me. What's
gonna happen

625
01:12:54,085 --> 01:12:55,220
will happen quick.

626
01:12:55,252 --> 01:12:58,255
I'll stall long as I can,
but I want you to sneak out back

627
01:12:58,288 --> 01:13:00,125
and hole up at Roger's Mill...

628
01:13:00,157 --> 01:13:01,659
...and wait for me there.

629
01:13:02,059 --> 01:13:04,094
Only use this if you have to.

630
01:13:04,127 --> 01:13:06,163
- Let me fight.
- I can't do this right

631
01:13:06,195 --> 01:13:07,997
if I'm worried about
protecting you.

632
01:13:08,030 --> 01:13:09,634
Just turn me over.

633
01:13:10,601 --> 01:13:12,570
You don't, they're gonna
kill us all.

634
01:13:12,603 --> 01:13:13,371
You and me both know

635
01:13:13,404 --> 01:13:15,005
they're fixin' to do
that anyway.

636
01:13:15,038 --> 01:13:17,643
And yet you expect me
to run out into sure gunfire?

637
01:13:18,076 --> 01:13:19,176
Your boy's right.

638
01:13:25,115 --> 01:13:26,618
Stay inside.

639
01:13:26,650 --> 01:13:28,686
Stay away from the window.

640
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:31,221
You have to shoot,
aim for the chest, and...

641
01:13:31,253 --> 01:13:32,957
Keep firing till I
hit something.

642
01:13:50,974 --> 01:13:52,176
I've had
some suspicions

643
01:13:52,210 --> 01:13:54,579
about who you are,
Henry McCarty.

644
01:13:57,079 --> 01:14:01,586
I got to admit, that name
sticks in me like a thorn.

645
01:14:01,985 --> 01:14:04,256
My curiosity was aroused.

646
01:14:05,756 --> 01:14:08,259
I was hoping Al here
might shed some light.

647
01:14:09,993 --> 01:14:11,829
He wouldn't say shit.

648
01:14:12,829 --> 01:14:14,932
Even after my boys were...

649
01:14:14,965 --> 01:14:18,769
what's the word?
Uh, emphatic in their question.

650
01:14:21,003 --> 01:14:23,073
You probably
concluded I'm no sheriff.

651
01:14:24,007 --> 01:14:26,010
Nor are these men my deputies.

652
01:14:27,077 --> 01:14:28,846
Not a one of us had spent time

653
01:14:28,878 --> 01:14:31,015
in Woods County
before a month ago.

654
01:14:32,416 --> 01:14:33,618
What about you?

655
01:14:35,018 --> 01:14:36,354
Where'd you come from?

656
01:14:37,421 --> 01:14:39,923
Every place on earth but this.

657
01:14:42,826 --> 01:14:44,094
So be it.

658
01:14:44,127 --> 01:14:45,296
Last offer.

659
01:14:47,164 --> 01:14:48,899
This tongue-tied piece of shit

660
01:14:48,932 --> 01:14:50,769
for Sheriff Curry in there
and the money.

661
01:14:51,268 --> 01:14:52,703
You get what you want.

662
01:14:53,103 --> 01:14:54,305
I get what I want.

663
01:14:54,971 --> 01:14:57,942
We go our separate ways
without blood spilled.

664
01:14:58,975 --> 01:15:01,712
Not yours, not mine.

665
01:15:02,244 --> 01:15:04,148
Not that boy of yours I
see surveilling

666
01:15:04,181 --> 01:15:05,751
all this through that window.

667
01:15:08,018 --> 01:15:09,185
If I wanted bloodshed,

668
01:15:09,219 --> 01:15:12,155
I'd have busted in there guns
a-blazin' a long time ago.

669
01:15:13,490 --> 01:15:15,127
I believe you know that.

670
01:15:15,859 --> 01:15:18,863
You leave my brother-in-law
right where he is.

671
01:15:19,730 --> 01:15:22,900
Turn and ride your asses
off my property.

672
01:15:22,932 --> 01:15:26,136
You do that, and I'll
let you live.

673
01:15:30,474 --> 01:15:32,376
You hear that, fellas?

674
01:15:32,409 --> 01:15:35,046
Is that the talk of a
mild old sodbuster?

675
01:15:35,078 --> 01:15:37,081
I think not.

676
01:15:38,347 --> 01:15:39,350
Nah.

677
01:15:40,284 --> 01:15:42,688
That sounds like
something else altogether.

678
01:15:44,186 --> 01:15:45,055
Hobbs!

679
01:15:46,289 --> 01:15:49,092
Anything you could tell me
might change the equation here?

680
01:15:52,229 --> 01:15:55,466
Kiss my ass,
you long-winded son of a bitch.

681
01:15:58,802 --> 01:16:01,773
You got a pair, I'll
give you that.

682
01:16:05,375 --> 01:16:06,810
Last chance, Al.

683
01:16:10,213 --> 01:16:15,953
You have no idea the hell storm
you fixin' to let loose.

684
01:16:18,989 --> 01:16:20,992
Consider me properly warned.

685
01:16:27,798 --> 01:16:30,402
Easy. Whoa.

686
01:16:33,869 --> 01:16:35,005
Easy, fella.

687
01:16:42,412 --> 01:16:44,949
Goddamn.

688
01:16:46,317 --> 01:16:47,418
Look at that.

689
01:16:48,418 --> 01:16:50,121
I'd say she's done.

690
01:16:50,153 --> 01:16:52,155
Ain't that a thing of beauty?

691
01:16:59,563 --> 01:17:00,498
Wyatt!

692
01:17:05,569 --> 01:17:06,771
Get in!

693
01:17:16,913 --> 01:17:17,916
You still with us?

694
01:17:18,248 --> 01:17:20,484
Less of me.

695
01:17:21,918 --> 01:17:23,889
Whoa. Whoa.

696
01:17:30,161 --> 01:17:31,162
McCarty!

697
01:17:33,329 --> 01:17:35,064
You dead yet?

698
01:17:35,865 --> 01:17:37,134
I sure ain't.

699
01:17:37,167 --> 01:17:38,969
I'm assuming the fact
I ain't seen

700
01:17:39,002 --> 01:17:41,271
my man Duggan this morning

701
01:17:41,304 --> 01:17:44,074
means he must have crossed
paths with you,

702
01:17:44,106 --> 01:17:45,943
and things didn't go his way.

703
01:17:48,345 --> 01:17:51,949
Seeing as how I just killed
your man Al here,

704
01:17:51,981 --> 01:17:53,484
I'd say that squares us.

705
01:17:54,585 --> 01:17:56,119
No more games.

706
01:17:56,152 --> 01:17:58,823
You got one minute to come out.

707
01:18:00,457 --> 01:18:02,393
You nearly got us both killed,

708
01:18:02,425 --> 01:18:04,293
which is about all your
tears and rage

709
01:18:04,327 --> 01:18:05,462
would have amounted to.

710
01:18:07,931 --> 01:18:11,402
Now keep your damn head down.
You'll be all right.

711
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:19,542
<i>Keep your head down,</i>

712
01:18:19,576 --> 01:18:21,177
<i>you'll be all right.</i>

713
01:18:28,385 --> 01:18:30,387
Poe and McKinney were
on the porch.

714
01:18:32,222 --> 01:18:33,425
Garrett went in the house.

715
01:18:40,497 --> 01:18:43,100
Two shots... but he...

716
01:18:44,201 --> 01:18:48,239
And you were
speaking Spanish to 'em.

717
01:18:51,675 --> 01:18:53,210
But he didn't kill you.

718
01:18:54,010 --> 01:18:55,646
He helped you escape.

719
01:18:57,079 --> 01:18:58,349
You're him.

720
01:19:01,284 --> 01:19:02,487
He's who?

721
01:19:05,121 --> 01:19:06,323
Bonney.

722
01:19:07,524 --> 01:19:09,027
Pa, what is he talking about?

723
01:19:19,036 --> 01:19:21,139
Pa!

724
01:19:28,179 --> 01:19:29,980
Smart choice, friend.

725
01:19:42,592 --> 01:19:43,595
What's he saying?

726
01:20:20,030 --> 01:20:23,068
Don't you dare step outside.

727
01:22:36,432 --> 01:22:37,469
Ah.

728
01:22:40,470 --> 01:22:42,106
Aah!

729
01:24:25,975 --> 01:24:28,212
Fuck.

730
01:26:54,856 --> 01:26:55,891
You all right?

731
01:27:15,912 --> 01:27:16,913
Oh.

732
01:27:20,951 --> 01:27:24,822
Wyatt. Fetch
a pail of water and some rags.

733
01:27:24,854 --> 01:27:25,822
Go on.

734
01:27:33,729 --> 01:27:36,500
You've certainly seen
better days.

735
01:27:36,532 --> 01:27:38,402
I knew you had a familiar face.

736
01:27:39,235 --> 01:27:41,671
I just couldn't place
it at first.

737
01:27:42,572 --> 01:27:44,873
We'll get the doc.

738
01:27:44,907 --> 01:27:47,144
First I gotta slow the bleed.

739
01:27:48,244 --> 01:27:50,648
How you manage
to stay hidden all these years?

740
01:27:51,814 --> 01:27:53,884
Let's get some of this
shirt off you.

741
01:27:53,916 --> 01:27:55,819
I can use it to tie
off this leg.

742
01:28:33,189 --> 01:28:34,458
Well, shit.

743
01:28:35,692 --> 01:28:37,462
I wish you didn't see that.

744
01:28:43,865 --> 01:28:46,869
It's just like I heard
you tell your boy before.

745
01:28:47,703 --> 01:28:51,842
Ain't that I lied, I just never
told you the whole truth.

746
01:28:53,076 --> 01:28:55,246
Was you law at all?

747
01:28:55,278 --> 01:28:57,780
Sheriff of Woods County,
just like I said.

748
01:28:59,148 --> 01:29:00,149
Me and my deputies,

749
01:29:00,182 --> 01:29:02,719
we signed on with Ketchum
back in the spring.

750
01:29:04,119 --> 01:29:05,689
We had to take their brand.

751
01:29:07,123 --> 01:29:08,591
Done a few jobs with 'em.

752
01:29:08,625 --> 01:29:10,060
But we figured out
they was planning

753
01:29:10,092 --> 01:29:11,628
to gun us down on this last go.

754
01:29:13,296 --> 01:29:15,265
So we tried to beat 'em
to the punch.

755
01:29:15,298 --> 01:29:17,768
Took off, and they plugged me
from a distance.

756
01:29:20,036 --> 01:29:22,105
They'd have hunted me
to the end of the earth.

757
01:29:24,307 --> 01:29:26,042
I'm sorry I ended up here.

758
01:29:27,978 --> 01:29:30,180
Last thing I wanted,
you wanna know the truth of it.

759
01:29:32,715 --> 01:29:34,083
'Cause you were good to
me back then.

760
01:29:35,018 --> 01:29:36,020
Huh.

761
01:29:37,119 --> 01:29:38,988
I could never square
you done the things they said.

762
01:29:40,356 --> 01:29:42,926
Though I sure as hell
can believe it now.

763
01:29:52,902 --> 01:29:54,837
I don't even remember you.

764
01:29:55,938 --> 01:29:59,175
Well, why would you?
I was just a ranch hand.

765
01:30:00,911 --> 01:30:03,146
Now I get to be the man
who killed Billy the Kid.

766
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:19,229
- You hold on, I'll get the doc.
- No.

767
01:30:21,163 --> 01:30:22,198
Pa.

768
01:30:22,231 --> 01:30:24,569
It's a miracle I made
it this far.

769
01:30:27,903 --> 01:30:29,239
Once this gets out...

770
01:30:30,673 --> 01:30:33,610
you gonna hear some
things about me.

771
01:30:33,643 --> 01:30:34,978
Some of it's true.

772
01:30:36,045 --> 01:30:37,346
A lot of it ain't.

773
01:30:39,015 --> 01:30:41,251
Fact is...

774
01:30:42,385 --> 01:30:45,922
I don't even know
who or what I was anymore.

775
01:30:47,323 --> 01:30:51,261
I don't believe
in redemption.

776
01:30:53,362 --> 01:30:56,032
But a man can find some
kind of solace...

777
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,269
if he's got a boy like
you to raise.

778
01:31:03,239 --> 01:31:04,875
The world is changing.

779
01:31:07,009 --> 01:31:08,278
You go see it.

780
01:31:09,979 --> 01:31:12,750
It's a place I don't belong in
no more.

781
01:31:16,385 --> 01:31:18,021
I'm hoping...

782
01:31:19,288 --> 01:31:20,724
you do.

783
01:31:31,167 --> 01:31:32,636
Pa?

784
01:31:33,903 --> 01:31:35,038
Pa?

785
01:33:16,137 --> 01:33:17,407
Come on.

786
01:35:32,686 --> 01:35:35,686
