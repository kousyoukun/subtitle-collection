1
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,880
啊
Ah.

2
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,660
来吧
Come on.

3
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:40,860
看着我
Look at me.

4
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,800
他去哪里了
Where'd he get to?

5
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,060
他去哪里了
Where'd he get to?

6
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,900
我不知道
I don't know.

7
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,400
不
No!

8
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:19,980
拿绳子来
Get the rope.

9
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,460
我们 向东前往印第安领地
We's... headin' east, towards Indian territory.

10
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,120
他的状况不好
He's in a bad way.

11
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,980
这就是你要说的全部吗
Is that everything you have to say on the matter?

12
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,580
我发誓 我发誓
I swear. I swear!

13
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,830
你知道吗
You know what?

14
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,840
我相信你
I believe you.

15
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,220
喔 达根
Whoa. Duggan.

16
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,480
喔
Whoa.

17
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,740
什么鬼
The hell?

18
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,200
你他妈是怎么知道
How the hell you figure this wound up

19
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,980
这片草地里有这东西的
out here in the middle of these grassland?

20
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,120
这真不错
This will work out nice.

21
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,260
放我走
Just cut me loose.

22
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,780
你再也不会见到我 真的 放我走吧
You'll never see me again, honest. Just cut me loose.

23
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,740
坐起来
Sit on up.

24
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,880
好吧 听着 我可以放了你
Well, you see, I would cut you loose,

25
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,620
但这会违背我对正义的坚持
but that just violates my sense of what's right.

26
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,400
老 亨 利

27
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,780
很难分辨一个人是谁 是什么人
It can be hard to tell who and what a man is,

28
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,720
他有足够能力可以说服你
he's got a mind to convince you otherwise.

29
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:25,020
我的族人来自我出生的纽约
My people were from New York, where I was born.

30
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,020
我三岁的时候
By the time I was three,

31
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,820
我们来到堪萨斯州科菲维尔
we'd made it to coffeyville, Kansas,

32
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:34,800
然后是亚利桑那州和新墨西哥州
then down to Arizona, then new Mexico.

33
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,080
我曾在墨西哥呆过一段时间
I was in Mexico proper for a time.

34
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,760
我做过很多种职业
I've tried my hand at many a vocation.

35
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,960
有些职业的收入更低
Some more marginal than others.

36
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,340
最后 我决定做一个农民
Finally, I settled on the life of a farmer.

37
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,080
这就是我
Which is what I am.

38
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,930
俄克拉荷马于1907年加入美国联邦 成为第46个州
俄克拉荷马准州 -1906

39
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,800
我们要储备猪饲料
We got that hog, stock to feed,

40
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,340
把地窖装满
and a root cellar to fill.

41
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,700
现在有拖拉机可以在很短时间做完这些
There's tractors can do this now in quarter the time.

42
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,920
是这样吗
Is that right?

43
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:01,860
我认为这里
And here I thought

44
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,960
怀亚特 种田是你的本份
farming was in your bones, Wyatt.

45
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,220
这里对你来说是个养家的好地方
This would be a good place for you to raise a family of your own.

46
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,400
我知道你妈妈会这么想的
I know your ma would have felt that way.

47
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,860
我不是她
I ain't her.

48
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,000
或他
Or him.

49
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,760
“人以智慧建造房屋”
By wisdom is a house built,

50
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:22,000
出自《圣经·箴言》 第24章第3节

51
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,000
“以聪明使它立得稳固”
and through understanding is it established.

52
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,820
“藉知识把房间充满各样”
Through knowledge are its rooms filled

53
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,820
“珍奇美丽的宝物”
with rare and beautiful treasures.

54
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,380
“那些一心朝圣的人是有福的”
And blessed are those hearts that are set on pilgrimage.

55
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,480
尽管我想留下来
Much as I'd like to stick around...

56
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,920
听你们互相引用圣经
Listen to y'all quote scripture at each other...

57
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,870
我要去打鸟了
I'm goin' bird huntin'.

58
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,120
谢谢你帮我 艾尔
Thanks for the help, al.

59
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,180
很高兴来这里
It does me good to be here.

60
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,540
不知何故 这里仍然让我觉得与玛丽有联系
Makes me feel like I'm still connected to Marie somehow.

61
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,940
帮你舅父收拾一下东西
Give your uncle a hand with his things.

62
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,920
前提是你已经休息好了
That is, if you've had sufficient respite.

63
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,540
谢谢你 孩子
Thank you, son.

64
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,260
好的 舅父
Yes, sir.

65
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,260
我今天早上准备去打猎
Yeah, I wanted to go huntin' this mornin',

66
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,200
但你爸说他需要帮忙
but your pa said he needed some help.

67
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,220
我当然想有一天和你一起去
Sure would like to go with you one of these days.

68
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,920
我觉得这不太合适
I don't think that'd go over too well.

69
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,390
你爸是个好人 怀亚特
Your pa's a good man, Wyatt.

70
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,960
否则我也不会让妹妹嫁给他了
I wouldn't let him marry my sister if I didn't think so.

71
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,000
用不了多久 你就可以
Soon enough, you'll be able to

72
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,420
随心所欲去旅行和打猎了
do all the travelin' and shootin' you want to.

73
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,400
别再纠结这个
Stop frettin' about it.

74
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,240
我们晚饭吃两块排骨 其余的熏制起来
We'll take two chops for supper and smoke the rest.

75
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,720
我没时间打理这些
I ain't got time to render this.

76
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,320
扔到猪舍里
Throw it in the pen.

77
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,560
你不觉得难受吗 它们吃自己
Don't it bother you sometimes, they eat their own?

78
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,700
对猪来说没什么区别
Don't make no difference to a hog.

79
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,900
你为什么住在这里
Why'd you settle here?

80
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,140
是什么意思
What's that meant to mean?

81
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,520
为什么在准州 不是别的地方
Why? Why the territory, of all places?

82
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,640
因为可以主张所有权
You could stake a claim,

83
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:09,990
指1889年4月 俄克拉荷马准州发生的“圈地潮”

84
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,920
持续使用一年 它就是你的了
hang onto it for a year, it was yours.

85
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,990
在当时似乎是个不错的交易
Seemed like a pretty good deal at the time.

86
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,180
你知道的 必须在枪响前赶到这里
Got here before the guns went off, you know that.

87
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,030
我还是不信这就是你想要的
I still don't believe this is what you wanted.

88
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,530
黎明时分起床 喂牲口 收割庄稼
Up at dawn, feedin' the stock, workin' the crops.

89
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,440
无论热还是冷 雨或晴
Hot or cold, rain or shine.

90
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,060
你会发现有更糟糕的安排
You'll discover there's worse arrangements.

91
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:38,920
爸爸
Pa?

92
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,220
放松 姑娘 就这样
Easy, gal, that's it.

93
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,760
我在你这么大的时候
Had me a mare near just like this

94
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,280
就像这样靠近过一匹母马
when I wasn't much older than you.

95
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,480
看这里
Lookie here.

96
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,580
你觉得发生了什么 是抢劫吗
What do you think happened? Some kind of robbery?

97
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:39,110
-枪战 -别乱说
-A shootout? -Shut your nonsense.

98
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,400
我最好去找那个骑手
I'd best go look for the rider.

99
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,320
好的 我去装马鞍
Yeah, I'll go saddle up.

100
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:48,200
你看好这匹马 待在里面等我回来
You tend to this horse and stay inside till I get back.

101
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,980
但如果有麻烦呢 爸爸 我可以帮你
But what if it's trouble, pa? I can help you.

102
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,060
继续 照我说的做
Go on. Do as I say.

103
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,860
喂
Hello.

104
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:56,960
不好
Nope.

105
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,310
怀亚特
Wyatt!

106
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,060
-他还活着吗 -还有口气
-Is he alive? -Barely.

107
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,480
他一个人吗
Was he alone?

108
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,040
是的 但那里还有其他人的踪迹
No, but I dispatched with a dozen others was there.

109
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,300
帮我一把
Give me a hand.

110
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,040
他 他失血过多
He's... he's lost a lot of blood.

111
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,760
他还能活吗
Is he gonna live?

112
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,080
我想取决于我们
Be up to us, I suppose.

113
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,260
现在太晚路又远 没法去找医生
Too far and too late to fetch the doc.

114
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,540
我去 如果必要 可以连夜赶路
Well, I can go. Ride all night if I have to.

115
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,880
我相信你可以
I'm sure you would.

116
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,800
所以
So?

117
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,900
你就呆在这里 把那瓶金缕梅给我
You'll stay right here. Hand over that witch Hazel.

118
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,540
他是个亡命徒
That is an outlaw.

119
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,360
在奔跑中摔下了马
On the run, shot off his horse.

120
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,580
你觉得他杀过人吗
You think he killed somebody?

121
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,480
怀亚特 我知道的跟你一样多
Wyatt, I know just as much as you do.

122
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,560
那是做什么
What's that for?

123
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,940
把伤口扎紧 以免他夜里失血太多
Seal the wound tight so he don't bleed out overnight.

124
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,960
不 胸部受伤千万别抬高双脚
No! Don't never elevate the feet with a chest wound.

125
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,900
我看到了你身上的伤疤
I've seen the scars on your body.

126
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,940
因为我没有对你隐瞒
'Cause I ain't hid'em from you.

127
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,240
现在也许你明白你的成长经历了
Now maybe you'll understand your raisin'.

128
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,030
来压住这里
Put your hand right here.

129
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,840
你要去哪里
Where you goin'?

130
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,220
在我回来前一直压着
Just keep applyin' pressure till I get back.

131
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:41,860
现在做什么
What now?

132
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,500
子弹必须出来 不然他会死
Bullet's gotta come out. And he won't make the ride.

133
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,260
分开绳子
Half that rope.

134
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,480
我去找医生
I'll fetch the doc.

135
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,940
你留在这里看着他
You'll stay here and keep an eye on him.

136
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,120
你真的觉得有必要吗
You really think that's necessary?

137
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,110
有必要
It ain't not necessary.

138
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,150
你为什么不冷静下来
Now, why don't you cool his fever

139
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,740
而不是为你
instead of vaporizin' on every

140
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,550
脑子里的想法感到自豪
thought that comes into your head?

141
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,020
没有痕迹
Trail's cold.

142
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,520
我们会抓住他
We'll get him.

143
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,220
那家伙能在水中追踪鱼
That dog could track a fish through water.

144
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,780
走吧
Come on.

145
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,260
如果他醒了 你要保持距离
He should come to, you keep your distance.

146
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,910
没事 他被绑住了
It don't matter he's tied up.

147
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,640
我自己能处理
I can handle myself.

148
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:55,180
照我说的做 我会尽快回来
You just do as I say. I'll be back soon as I can.

149
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,060
走吧
Come on.

150
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,520
比利在哪里
Where's Billy at?

151
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,200
是谁

152
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,180
低下头 你会没事的
Keep your head down. You'll be all right.

153
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,220
哇
Whoa.

154
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,160
他来过这里
He was here.

155
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,540
我不这么认为
Don't look like it to me.

156
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,340
如果我没猜错 他不是一个人
If I'm right, he weren't alone.

157
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,740
不管是谁都知道他做了什么
Whoever it is knows what he's doin'.

158
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,220
他像其他人一样很好的掩盖了行踪
Covered his tracks as good as anyone I've run across.

159
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,480
要不是这场雨 我早就找到他了
Weren't for this rain, I'd have found him sooner.

160
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,740
我不需要听你那愚蠢的
I don't need you to speechify the inner workings

161
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,090
狗脑子是如何推测的
in your halfwit canine mind.

162
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,860
我只想知道他在哪里
I need to know where he's headed.

163
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,340
嗯 这并不能缩小搜索范围
Well, that don't exactly narrow it down.

164
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,000
我在哪里
Where am I?

165
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,600

我爸爸发现你 快死了

00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,580
你爸爸是谁
Who's your pa?

170
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,280
普通人 呃
Nobody. Uh...

171
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,580
亨利 就是个农民
Henry. Just a-a farmer.

172
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,160
什么 这里只有你和他

我不想伤害你 别动
I don't want to hurt you. Stop moving!

181
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:36,460
你把我的枪和包放哪儿了 听我说
Where'd you put my gun and my satchel? Listen to me!

182
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,800
我不知道你在说什么 先生
I don't know what you're talkin' about, mister.

183
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,820
别骗我
Don't you lie to me!

184
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:42,120
你拿我的枪和包做什么
What'd you do with my gun and my satchel?

185
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,280
爸爸
Pa!

186
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,600
他是怎么逃脱的
How'd he get loose?

187
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:18,780
他扭动着挣脱了
H-He wriggled free.

188
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,500
挣脱的
Wriggled free?

189
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:24,040
他拿到我留在床头柜上的刀了
And got hold of my knife I left on the bedstand.

190
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,780
我们两个都有责任
Well, that's on the both of us.

191
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,480
帮我把这混蛋绑起来
Help me tie the son of a bitch back up.

好吧
Okay.

193
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:05,380
你最好仔细想想你自己惹的麻烦
You better think long and hard on what you got yourself into.

194
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,650
有趣 我正要对你说同样的话
Funny, I was about to tell you the same thing.

195
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:12,920
你想拿它做什么
What you aimin' to do with that?

196
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,180
把你身上的子弹取出来
Gonna dig that bullet out of you,

197
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,860
也许在这过程中会得到些答案
maybe get some answers in the process.

198
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,820
听到我想听的
I like what I hear,

199
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,240
我也许会给你点减轻痛苦的东西
I might be inclined to give you something to ease the pain.

200
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:30,940

204
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,960
从你告诉我你是谁开始
Let's start with you tellin' me who you are.

205
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,340
我是执法人员 是个警察
I'm law! I'm a goddamn lawman!

206
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,320
他不是警察 爸爸 他想杀了我
He ain't no lawman, pa, he was fixin' to kill me.

207
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,100
想喝点威士忌吗
Ready for some whisky?

208
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,460
我说了 我是执法人员
I just told you... I'm law.

209
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,920
问他钱的事
Ask him about the money.

210
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:58,500
什么钱
What money?

211
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,700
他问过我这个
He asked me about it.

212
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,720
听着 听我说
Listen. Listen to me.

一个拿着满满一包现金的警察在干什么
What's a shot lawman doin' with a satchel full of cash?

215
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,860
听着

216
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,740
听着 如果你还有脑子
Listen! If you got a brain in your head,

217
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,640
你就必须带上你的孩子

218
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,120
尽快离开这里

噢 不 不 不
Oh, no! No, no!

222
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,180
至少在我找到想知道的之前
At least we know you won't die

223
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,300
你一时还死不了
'fore I find out what I want to know.

224
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,760
噢 上帝

228
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,570
拜托 放开我 快 放开我
Come on, cut me loose. Come on, cut me loose.

229
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,880
听着 他们可能有三个人
Listen, they gon' be three of'em.

230
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,840
一个是墨西哥人

231
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,500
另一个是留着大胡子的
The other's an ugly son of a bitch

232
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,000
丑八怪
with a thick beard.

233
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,790
而他们的头
And their leader...

234
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,760
他们的老大看起来是个你不想惹的人
Their leader looks like a man you don't want to mess with.

235
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:32,220
相信我 你不会想惹
And believe me, you don't.

236
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,030
不要靠近窗户
Keep back from the window.

237
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,600
如果你们想活命 就放开我
If you want to live, you gotta turn me loose

238
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,820
把枪给我 听到了吗
and give me my gun, hear?

239
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,770
他在撒谎
He's lyin'.

240
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,200
我说了退后
I said keep back.

241
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,760
照做
Go on.

242
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,720
我能帮你们吗
Can I help you?

243
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,280
我是萨姆·凯彻姆警长
I'm sheriff Sam ketchum.

244
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,900
他们是我的副手
These here are my deputies.

245
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,000
我们一直在追踪一个逃犯
We've been scoutin' for a man on the run.

246
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,300
他最近自称叫柯里
Lately goes by the name of curry.

247
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,520
被击伤了
Been shot.

248
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,700
六英尺高 棕色头发 据说很帅
Six foot, brown hair, said to be handsome,

249
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,140
尽管大多数人都觉得他只是个小混混
though most would want him credited for nothing but devilry.

250
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:04,140
但我知道 他很危险
What I do know is, he's dangerous.

251
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,760
你看到这附近有这些特征的人吗
You seen anybody around here answers that description?

252
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,130
你说你是警长 我怎么不认识你
Say you're a sheriff? How's it I don't recognize you?

253
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,700
我们从伍兹县那边来的
We're from way over in woods county.

254
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,140
我们现在要找的柯里
Now, this curry we're looking for,

255
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,630
他在密苏里州和
he's got a warrant on him there

256
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,900
田纳西州都有逮捕令
in Missouri and Tennessee.

257
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,760
他可能自称是执法人员
Might also claim he's the law.

258
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,780
他曾经玩过这种把戏
He's got a history of such chicanery.

259
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,660
但远非如此
Far from it.

260
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,560
他是个杀手
He's a killer.

261
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,480
他会再次杀人
He will kill again.

262
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,250
你不会用那把枪
You're not fixin' to shoot

263
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,800
朝我们射击吧 是吗
any of us with that pistol, are you?

264
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,790
目前我没理由这么做
So far I got no reason to.

265
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,130
是个好消息
That's good news.

266
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:50,500
农夫 在你举起那把枪前得想清楚
You'll want to think'fore you raise that thing up, farmer.

267
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,320
没什么好担心的 朋友
Nothing to be worried about here, friend.

268
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,380
只是我正在做的一个小东西
Just a little project I'm working on,

269
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,580
仅此而已
that's all.

270
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,180
有多少人住在这里
How many people live out here?

271
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,420
这和你有什么关系
What difference is that to you?

272
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,800
我只是想确定你是安全的
I'm trying to make sure you're safe, is all.

273
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,160
这似乎不归你管
Wouldn't seem to be your business,

274
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,400
因为你是从伍兹县来的
seeing as how you're from woods county.

275
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,860
你结过婚
You married?

276
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,560
我看见那边有一座坟墓
Saw a grave over there.

277
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,060
是我妻子
My wife.

278
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,820
十年前死于肺结核
Died ten years back from tuberculosis.

279
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,180
节哀顺变
My condolences.

280
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,000
可怕的离开方式
Horrible way to go.

281
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,920
爸爸 告诉他们
Tell'em, pa. Tell'em!

282
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:36,300
墓上刻着 玛丽·霍布斯·麦卡蒂
Marie hobbs mccarty, the marker said.

283
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,660
你姓麦卡蒂
Your last name mccarty?

284
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,110
没错
That's right.

285
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,320
名字呢
First name?

286
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:47,240
亨利
Henry.

287
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,930
我猜霍布斯是她的族人
So hobbs was her people, I'm guessing.

288
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,860
因为我看到东边有个霍布斯农场
'Cause I noticed a hobbs ranch to the east of here.

289
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,600
是她的兄弟
Her brothers.

290
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,300
嗯
Uh-huh.

291
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,200
嗯 从这些东西来看
Well, from the looks of things,

292
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:04,010
你在这里已经住了多年
you've been out here a good many years.

293
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,560
环境不错
Nice situation.

294
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,380
都依偎在这群山中
All nestled up here in the hills.

295
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,210
从远处很难发现
Hard to see from a distance.

296
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,650
这跟你要找的那个人有什么关系
What's any of this got to do with the man you're lookin' for?

297
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,150
关系不大 我承认
Not much, I'll Grant you.

298
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,000
很久以前 呃
Long time ago, uh...

299
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,940
一个人在新墨西哥州和亚利桑那州惹了些麻烦
Was a fella caused some trouble down Arizona, new Mexico way.

300
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,760
听说他叫麦卡蒂
Heard he went by the name mccarty.

301
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:35,840
我想知道他是否是你的亲戚
I was wondering if he might be your kin.

302
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,420
你找错人了
You got the wrong pig by the ear.

303
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:40,920
意思是
Meaning?

304
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,810
除了这里 我不认识任何地方的麦卡蒂
I don't know no mccartys anywhere but here,

305
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:46,910
我所有亲戚都死了
and all my kin is deceased.

306
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,660
现在我要做晚饭
Now I got chores to tend to

307
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,660
木柴不够 我要干活去了
and scant wood to cook my supper.

308
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,980
我没见过你要找的人
I ain't seen the man you're after.

309
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,030
我会保持警惕
I'll keep my eyes peeled.

310
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,700
如果我在切克沙见到他
Be sure to alert the good sheriff

311
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:02,930
肯定会通知好警长
in chickasha if I should run across him.

312
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,220
那好吧
Well, then.

313
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:09,880
谢谢你的帮助
I thank you for your help.

314
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,500
看起来又是条死胡同 孩子们
Looks like another dead end, boys.

315
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,950
你今晚一定要关好门
You be sure to lock your doors tonight.

316
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:22,840
注意安全
Stay safe.

317
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:27,680
走吧
Come on.

318
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,900
现在你想用这个了吗
Now you're inclined to hang onto that?

319
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,120
我想你可能需要帮助
I thought you might be needin' help.

320
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,920
你想告诉我这是怎么用的吗
You wanna tell me how this got fired?

321
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:56,960
我会用 爸爸
Honest, pa.

322
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,240
别骗我
Don't you lie to me!

323
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,440
我知道它如何使用
I wanted to know what it's like.

324
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:06,580
我是50英里内唯一一个从未开过枪的男孩
I am the only boy for 50 miles that's never fired one.

325
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:09,400
你甚至不让我碰你的旧猎枪
You won't even let me lay hand on your old shotgun.

326
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:13,040
所以你不教我射击 我只能自己学
So if you can't teach me proper, I gotta do it myself.

327
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:17,470
如果你再动我的枪 我就揍你
You get into my things again, I will crack your crust!

328
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,420
你就是个又蠢又没用的老头
You're a stupid, worthless old man.

329
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,360
一辈子除了守着这破农场
A whole life, and nothin' to show for it

330
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:26,880
根本碌碌无为
but this rundown old farm

331
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:30,380
还有一个会离开你 让你孤独老死的男孩
and a boy who's gonna leave you alone to die as soon as he's able.

332
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:44,520
让我猜猜
Let me guess.

333
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:48,740
你会告诉我他不是伍兹县的治安官
You gon' tell me that he ain't the sheriff of woods county, you are.

334
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,200
他们不是 他们是银行劫匪
They ain't lawmen, they're bank robbers.

335
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,740
好吧 他们干了些什么
Well, what's left of them, anyway.

336
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:57,680
抢劫了亚当斯快车
Knocked over the Adams express.

337
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:01,240
我和副手追上去杀了其中两人
Me and my deputies gave chase, killed two of'em,

338
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:02,640
包括那个携带赃款的人
including the one carrying the loot.

339
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,520
银行劫匪戴着徽章
Bank robbers wearin' badges?

340
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,190
他们从我们这里偷的
That they took off me and my men.

341
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:08,900
他是冒充执法人员
He's the one impersonating the law.

342
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,340
但是你把钱拿走了
But you made off with the money.

343
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,460
见鬼 是的 我拿了
Hell, yeah, I grabbed it.

344
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,680
那你为什么不带着钱回伍兹县
Then why ain't you back with it in woods county?

345
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:24,100
噢 不知道 为什么必须这么做
Oh, I don't know. Why does it look like?

346
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:28,280
我的首要任务是
And my first priority was

347
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:29,900
活着逃离那伙人
getting away from that bunch alive.

348
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,020
这就是为什么我拼命跑 直到晕倒
That's why I rode like hell till I couldn't no more.

349
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,880
我记得的最后一件事 就是在这里醒来
There's the last thing I remembered, till I woke up here.

350
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:39,940
听着 我知道这些话对你来说都很荒谬
Look, I know what I'm saying sounds ridiculous to you and all.

351
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,360
确实如此
That it does.

352
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,060
我不知道他们刚才为什么没开枪杀了你
Why they didn't shoot you dead on the spot just now, I don't know.

353
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:46,760
但我可以向你保证
But I can guarantee you...

354
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:49,340
他们会回来的
They'll be back.

355
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,020
我唯一不明白是
Only thing I can't figure

356
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,220
那老头为什么会为一个陌生人冒生命危险
is why the old man would risk his neck for a stranger.

357
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,230
也许他得到了一笔钱
Maybe he got offered a cut of the money.

358
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:55,360
有些迹象表明不是这样
Something tells me that ain't it.

359
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:59,500
我们谁都可以干掉他
Any one of us could have taken him out.

360
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,900
这就是我们现在该做的
Which is what we should do now.

361
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:06,110
-马上行动 -还不行
-Ride up, finish it. -Not just yet.

362
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,540
因为那个东倒西歪的老农
'Cause of some shaky old farmer?

363
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:15,280
他不像我见过的任何农民那样拿枪
He didn't hold that pistol like any farmer I've ever seen.

364
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,660
我们有三个人
There are three of us.

365
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:22,390
我们不会抢银行 也不会不了解情况
We don't run up in a bank, or ride up on a stage

366
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:23,680
就去抢劫驿站
without knowing who's in it.

367
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:27,260
但我们知道柯里带着钱在房子里
We know curry's in there. With our money!

368
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:31,120
这就是你要去侦察那个所谓农夫之家的原因
Which is why you're going to reconnoiter that so-called farmer's place

369
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,440
确保柯里还没有逃走
and make sure curry don't skedaddle.

370
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,320
很乐意
Gladly.

371
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,000
在我们到之前不要妄动
Don't make a move till we get there.

372
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:41,320
好的
Fine.

373
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,820
-达根 -我说很好
-Duggan. -I said fine.

374
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:56,000
明早日出时 你跟我去切克沙
Come sunup, you and me will head into chickasha,

375
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:57,560
雇几个枪手
hire some guns.

376
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,360
知道了
Understood.

377
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:04,900
途中我们顺带拜访农夫霍布斯
On the way, we'll pay a call on farmer hobbs...

378
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:07,670
看看他有没有关于
Find out if he's got anything interesting

379
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:10,300
老亨利·麦卡蒂的事要告诉我们
to tell us about ol' Henry mccarty.

380
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:13,200
怀亚特
Wyatt. Come on in.

381
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,120
进来吧
Come on in.

382
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,480
-我快做完了 -留到早上做
-I'm almost finished. -Leave it till morning.

383
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:22,720
快点
Come on.

384
00:48:53,610 --> 00:48:56,580
如果我能自己吃饭 就更方便了
It'd be a damn sight easier if I could feed myself.

385
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:02,120
一点都不给你吃更方便
Be a damn sight easier not to feed you at all.

386
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:21,770
-我们曾经见过吗 -我会记得的
-You and me ever met? -That I'd remember.

387
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,120
你当警长多久了
How long you been a sheriff?

388
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:35,060
-到现在已经18年了 -你是怎么开始的
-I'd say onto 18 years now. -How'd you get your start?

389
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:39,250
我是大比尔·汤普森在斯特斯普陵的副手
I was a deputy for big bill Thompson in Baxter Springs.

390
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:44,240
斯特斯普陵 密苏里州
Baxter Springs. Baxter Springs, Missouri?

391
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:49,100
-堪萨斯州 -瘦个子 大耳朵
-Kansas. -Skinny fella, big ears?

392
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,560
很壮
Heavyset.

393
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:54,760
一个喝醉的矿工
Missing part of his left ear from

394
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,940
开枪打掉他一块耳朵
a drunk miner taking a potshot at him.

395
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,700
-我听说是个喝醉的妓女 -噢 是吗
-I heard it was a drunk whore. -Oh, you did?

396
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:05,750
你住在斯特斯普陵的哪个地方
Which part of Baxter Springs you live in?

397
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,980
一家旅馆 在格兰特驿站附近
A boarding house. Out near Grant's stage station.

398
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:13,150
女店主叫什么名字
What was the landlady's name?

399
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:15,980
她不是淑女
She weren't no lady.

400
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,460
她叫汉娜 是个讨厌的老太婆
She a nasty ol' cuss named Hannah.

401
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:25,200
你见过乔治·克鲁克吗
You ever run into a George crook?

402
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,980
你是说乔治将军
You mean general George?

403
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,270
这混蛋毕生致力于
Sumbitch dedicated his life

404
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,440
把印第安人赶出该地区
to driving the caddo out of the territory.

405
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,920
你到底是怎么来到斯特斯普陵的
How in the hell did you end up in Baxter Springs?

406
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:57,960
就像其他梦想着
Well, like every other fool

407
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,270
轻松挖矿发财的傻瓜一样
dreaming of easy riches and digging for tin.

408
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,640
直到我意识到根本是做梦
Till I realized there weren't none.

409
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,240
只不过是一堆关于烟山河矿区的传说
Just a bunch of ghost stories about a mine near smokey hill river.

410
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:09,060
然后我 我破产了 工作很难找
Then I... I was broke. Work was hard to come by.

411
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,500
我很幸运大比尔喜欢我
I'm lucky big bill took a liking to me.

412
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:15,300
否则我 我不知道我会怎么样
Otherwise I... I don't know what would have come of me.

413
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:21,180
很抱歉 我之前袭击了你儿子
I... I'm sorry I jumped your boy before.

414
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,800
我在一个陌生的地方醒来 不知道他是谁
I woke up in a strange place, didn't know who he was...

415
00:51:26,490 --> 00:51:28,580
我以为在某个藏身处被扣为人质
I was being held hostage in some hideout.

416
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,220
你觉得这像个藏身处吗
This look like a hideout to you?

417
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,740
我无意中听到他之前说的话
I overheard what he said earlier.

418
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:38,480
他不是那个意思
He didn't mean any of that.

419
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:41,610
对 他不是那意思
Yes, he did.

420
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:02,320
我解开你一只手 别让我再绑起来
I'll give you one hand free. Don't make me take it off.

421
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:03,680
好吧
All right.

422
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:10,460
好吧
All right.

423
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,790
你父亲也是农民吗
Was farming what your daddy did?

424
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:37,300
我爸爸在我3岁时就死了 在堪萨斯州
My daddy died when I was 3, up in Kansas.

425
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:40,770
除了种地 他几乎什么都做
And he did near everything but work the land.

426
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,940
我15岁时成了孤儿
I was orphaned at 15.

427
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,980
比我成为孤儿的时间少了13年
That's 13 years longer than I knew my folks.

428
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,280
啊 你在哪里长大的
Ah. Whereabouts you grow up?

429
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:54,920
新墨西哥州
New Mexico.

430
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,360
-哪个地方 -萨姆纳堡
-Which part? -Fort Sumner.

431
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,320
土生土长 听说过那里吗
Born and raised. You heard of it?

432
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:07,400
比利小子被杀的地方 是吗
Where Billy the kid was shot, wasn't it?

433
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,600
那里就是因此闻名的
Main reason anyone know it.

434
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:18,870
事情发生当晚我就在那里
I was there the night it happened.

435
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:23,380
情况怎样
How's that?

436
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:25,700
我当时只是个孩子
I was just a boy.

437
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:27,420
我曾经为一个叫
I used to make what money I could

438
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:30,500
彼得·麦克斯韦的人做零工努力挣钱
doing chores for a fella by the name of Peter Maxwell.

439
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,780
彼得·麦克斯韦安排比利过夜
Same Peter Maxwell put the kid up for the night.

440
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,720
他同时也给加勒特及他的副手
Same Peter Maxwell tipped off Garrett

441
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:37,460
波和麦金尼通风报信说
and his deputies, poe and mckinney,

442
00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:38,680
比利小子躲在那里
the kid was holed up there.

443
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,780
我正在打扫马厩
I was sweeping the stalls.

444
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:43,320
当我看到加勒特走进房子时 我
When I saw Garrett walk in the house, I...

445
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:45,300
我脑子里一片空白
I don't think nothing of it.

446
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,660
但比利不在里面 至少那时不在
But Billy wasn't in there. Not then, leastways.

447
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:51,880
-知道我怎么知道 -怎么
-Know how I know? -How?

448
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:54,040
在离我不到20呎的地方
He was barefoot in his shin sleeves,

449
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:55,740
他正赤脚挽起袖子
cutting the meat off a deer carcass

450
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:57,540
在鹿的身上切下肉
not 20 feet from where I was working.

451
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:03,960
我看见他从谷仓门往里偷看
I saw him peer through the barn door,

452
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:06,260
他看到了波和麦金尼在门廊上
and he saw poe and mckinney on the porch there.

453
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:10,320
他停止切肉 直视我的眼睛
He stopped carving, looked me dead in my eye.

454
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:13,980
他说 “低下头 你会没事的”
He said, "keep your head down, you'll be all right."

455
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,660
比利冲进麦克斯韦的房间
So Billy went straight to Maxwell's room,

456
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:20,300
他很快意识到不只是麦克斯韦在里面
realized pretty quick it ain't just Maxwell in there.

457
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,840
他喊道 “是谁 是谁 ”
He called out, "¿quien es? ¿quien es?"

458
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:27,760
因为比利的西班牙语说得和墨西哥人一样好
'Cause Billy spoke Spanish as good as a Mexican.

459
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,080
怎么回应的
Pat's answer?

460
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:35,950
开了两枪 一枪打偏 另一枪打中胸部
Two shots. One wide of the Mark, and the other one in the chest.

461
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:42,340
这就是比利小子的结局
That was the end of Billy the kid.

462
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,100
你都看到了
And you seen it all.

463
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:49,030
我确实看到了
I most certainly did.

464
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:50,870
也看到比利的尸体被拖走
Saw the kid's body get hauled off too,

465
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,020
裹在血淋淋的被单里
wrapped in a bloody sheet.

466
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:55,900
这让我意识到这不是我的生活
Enough to teach me that ain't no life for me.

467
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:58,740
我宁愿停止这种疯狂行为也不想陷入其中
I'd rather stop this crazy than be part of it anyway.

468
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,200
好吧
Well...

469
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:26,440
该死
Damn.

470
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,360
如果我知道一个好故事足以让你放我走
If I knew all it took was a good story for you to cut me loose.

471
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,380
你现在能坐稳马鞍吗
You well enough to stay upright in the saddle?

472
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:39,880
-应该可以 -我要你离开这里
-Not hardly. -I want you out of here.

473
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,200
我想等到黎明走不是个好选择
I suppose waiting till sunup ain't an option?

474
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,360
如果我一个人在这里 就不同了
If I was alone out here, it'd be different.

475
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:47,980
那么 我想我准备好了
Well, then, I guess I'm ready.

476
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:50,920
好的
Good.

477
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:55,640
拿去
Take it.

478
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:02,820
我去拿你的包
I'll fetch your loot.

479
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:40,140
-爸爸 -怀亚特 蹲下
-Pa? -Wyatt! Get down!

480
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:44,740
我想我没事
I-I think I'm all right.

481
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:48,120
他中枪了吗
Is... is he hit?

482
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:58,280
他只是昏过去了 给我枪
He just passed out. Give me that.

483
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,040
我用枪比你想象的好
I'm better with it than you think.

484
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,900
除非我教你正确的方法
Not until I teach you proper.

485
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,780
-我自学过了 -嘘
-I've taught myself -shush.

486
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:07,720
你们到哪里去了
Now, where'd you get to?

487
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,610
-他在房子下面 -嘘
-He's under the house. -Shh.

488
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:52,520
我希望你知道如何用这个
I hope you got good enough with this.

489
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:56,250
上帝不希望发生这种事 但开枪射人
God forbid it happens, but shooting a man

490
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,200
与射击靶子不同
is different than hitting a target...

491
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,740
一旦越线就回不来了
A line you can't cross back over.

492
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:01,580
我懂
I know that.

493
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:03,420
在你做过之前 你不会懂
You couldn't until you've done it.

494
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:06,790
如果他进来
If he comes in here...

495
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:09,100
你就扣动扳机
You pull that trigger.

496
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:12,230
瞄准胸部
Aim for the chest.

497
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:15,240
并连续开火直到击中
And keep firing until you hit it.

498
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,640
你要去哪里
Where you going?

499
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:56,740
狗杂种
Son of a bitch!

500
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:58,660
混蛋
Cocksucker!

501
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:00,240
妈的
Fuck.

502
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:09,360
该死
Shit.

503
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:42,180
其他人呢 他们在附近吗
Where's the others? They close?

504
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:43,490
去死吧
Go to hell.

505
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,330
这种方式我见得太多
I've been here too often to let

506
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:49,220
你这种人岂能瞒过我
a man of your caliber overhaul my baggage.

507
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:53,940
回答我 否则你现在就完蛋
Answer me, or it ends for you right now.

508
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:56,960
去死吧 你这混蛋
Go to hell, you bastard.

509
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:58,740
他想杀了我们两个
He was fixin' to kill us both.

510
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:02,500
我看见了
I saw.

511
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:05,920
他可能只是来侦查 然后想一人搞定
Probably here to watch and got greedy.

512
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:09,180
其他人会来的
The others will be coming.

513
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:14,480
首先 我们得把尸体处理掉
First thing, we gotta get rid of this body.

514
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,660
我们要怎么做
How we gonna do that?

515
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:23,580
你不用来
We ain't.

516
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,220
我知道这感觉不好
I know it don't feel like it.

517
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:27,180
你很幸运只是擦伤
You're lucky it just grazed ya.

518
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:33,500
如果你知道我找到了那把枪
If you know I found that gun,

519
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,400
你就知道我看到了壁橱后面的东西
you know I saw what's in the back of that closet.

520
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:40,480
你是谁
Who are you?

521
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:43,640
我就是我
I'm who I am.

522
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:48,040
你不是一直在说要诚实吗
Aren't you always preaching about being honest?

523
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:50,480
出自《圣经》
“真相将还你自由”
The truth will set you free?

524
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:54,820
我从来没有骗过你
I've never lied to you.

525
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:06,620
把整件事情告诉我不是一回事吗
Isn't not telling me the whole story the same damn thing?

526
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:15,220
我做了一些我希望能收回的事
I've done things I wish I could take back.

527
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:19,240
在有你之前很久 在有你妈妈之前
A long time before you. Before your ma.

528
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:23,120
你不该听到的事情
Things that you got no business hearing.

529
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:27,220
如果你不尊重我 我又怎么尊重你
How am I supposed to respect you if you ain't respecting me?

530
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,080
我尊重你
I am respecting you.

531
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:32,300
如果你不明白这点
And if you don't understand that,

532
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:34,260
那我刚才说的你一个字都没听见
you ain't heard a word I just said.

533
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:39,060
不 我听到了 我只是一点都不信
No, I heard it. I just don't believe a bit of it.

534
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,140
低下头
Keep your head down.

535
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:24,560
低下头 你会没事的
Keep your head down. You'll be all right.

536
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:26,180
你会没事的
You'll be all right.

537
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:26,660
喔
Whoa.

538
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:36,620
-早 -早
-Morning -morning.

539
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:40,670
-我能帮你什么吗 -我确实希望如此
-Something I can help you with? -I sure hope so.

540
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:45,850
你这地方真好 安宁 平静
Nice place you got here. Peaceful. Quiet.

541
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:49,280
打鸟
Bird hunting.

542
01:06:50,450 --> 01:06:52,750
没什么能比得上打一群鸟更好了
Nothing quite like the flush of the bevy.

543
01:06:54,650 --> 01:06:56,140
你肯定很擅长射击
You must be quite the shot.

544
01:06:58,560 --> 01:06:59,660
尽力而为
Do what I can.

545
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:01,830
我很羡慕你
I envy you.

546
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:04,380
尽管我这几天很想
I don't get to go out hunting

547
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:06,140
但我没法出去打猎
as much as I'd like to these days.

548
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:08,910
先生 有什么能帮你的吗
Something I can help you with, mister?

549
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,220
我爸爸过去常打野鸡
My daddy used to hunt pheasant.

550
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:16,240
打理它们一直是我该死的事
It was always my damn job to clean'em.

551
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:21,200
噢 割开胸部皮肤 把它剥开
Oh, cutting the skin on the breast, peeling it back.

552
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:25,720
但做久了 我找到了去除内脏的
But over time, I figured the best way

553
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,300
最好的方法
to get rid of their innards...

554
01:07:28,590 --> 01:07:32,320
就是把鸟的背劈开 就那么做
Was to split the bird's back. Get to'em that way.

555
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:36,440
你也这么发现的吗
Is that what you find?

556
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:37,860
听着 我不
Look, I don't...

557
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:40,600
我觉得不太礼貌 但是
Mean to be UN-neighborly, but...

558
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:43,580
开门见山吗 当然
But get to the point? Sure.

559
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:48,360
我想问你几个问题 呃
I wanted to ask you a couple questions about, uh,

560
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:49,910
是有关你妹夫的
your brother-in-law.

561
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,360
那么 你关心他什么
Well, what concern is he of yours?

562
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:56,220
这就是我想弄明白的
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

563
01:07:57,350 --> 01:07:59,380
你看 我有个疯狂的想法
You see, I got this crazy idea...

564
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:01,920
对老麦卡蒂来说
There might be more to ol' mccarty

565
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:03,240
远比看到的更多
than meets the eye.

566
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:05,760
你应该是个执法人员之类的吧
You supposed be some kind of lawman or something?

567
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:07,660
差不多
Something like that.

568
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:10,970
我想你该走了
Well, I think it's time you left.

569
01:08:11,730 --> 01:08:13,770
哦 我们来这里寻找一些答案
Well, we came here for some answers.

570
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,870
在找到答案前不会离开
We ain't leaving till I get'em.

571
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:19,400
是吗
That so?

572
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:25,040
我应该
I should...

573
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:33,240
现在我们怎么让他清醒过来
Now how the hell we gonna pick his ass up?

574
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:45,760
好吧 好的 谢谢
Okay. Okay, thank you.

575
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:02,320
天哪 好吧
Oh, god. Okay.

576
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:06,180
我无法旅行 我走不了
I'm no good to travel. I'm not.

577
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:09,420
你带着孩子 你们离开这里
You take the boy, you get out of here.

578
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:11,830
当凯彻姆和他的手下来时
When ketchum and his men arrive,

579
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:13,500
我会尽量拖住他们
I'll hold them off as long as I can.

580
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:15,820
-见鬼去吧 -怀亚特
-The hell with that! -Wyatt.

581
01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:18,580
我们有枪
We got guns.

582
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:21,470
你已经徒手杀了他们中一个
You already killed one of them barehanded.

583
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:24,120
打个包 我们离开
Fill a pack. We're leaving.

584
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:27,100
我警告过你
I'm warning you.

585
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:56,240
他回来了
He's back.

586
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:07,600
剩下的留着吧
Leave the rest.

587
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:09,360
我们不能把他留在这里等死
We can't just leave him here to die.

588
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:11,180
我他妈肯定不会因为
I am damn sure not gonna lose you

589
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:12,860
一些与我们无关的事失去你
over something that ain't our fight.

590
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:13,940
你爸爸是对的
Your pa's right.

591
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:15,820
我已经长大了 可以自己决定
I am old enough to make my own decisions,

592
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:17,780
不管你是否愿意接受
whether you are ready to accept that or not.

593
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:19,900
这是我要解决的事
Yeah. This is mine to finish.

594
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:21,980
快走吧 我不会有事
Go on, now. I'll be all right.

595
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:55,380
喔
Whoa.

596
01:10:59,100 --> 01:10:59,940
柯里
Curry!

597
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:02,380
家里有人吗
Anybody home?

598
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:05,860
你们需要什么吗
You gentlemen need something?

599
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:08,740
我们是来抓逃犯的
We're here for our fugitive.

600
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:11,660
我昨天告诉过你没见过他
I told you yesterday I ain't seen him.

601
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:15,480
我的直觉告诉我那不是真的
My intuition tells me that's not true.

602
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:18,120
我就直说了
I'll make it easy...

603
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:22,160
你把他交出来 我们就放过你和孩子
You hand him over, we let you and the boy go free.

604
01:11:23,190 --> 01:11:26,100
另一个选择是 我们带走他
The other option is, we take him.

605
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:28,220
你和那个孩子死
And you and the boy die.

606
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:30,780
你接受这个交易
You take that deal.

607
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:32,880
这是我的事 不是你的
I signed up for this, you didn't.

608
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:40,160
看看你的马已经备好鞍了
See your horses are already saddled.

609
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:42,660
你们可以骑着它离开这里
You can just ride on out of here.

610
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:50,860
你和我都知道在我们上马前就会被杀
You and I both know we'll be dead before we mount our horses.

611
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:56,820
在这变成一场屠杀之前
Fore this turns into some kinda brigasee,

612
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:59,420
你我为什么不用决斗
why don't me and you settle this,

613
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:01,000
来解决问题
knuckle and skull.

614
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,740
你作为一个农民经常打架
You got a lot of fight for a farmer.

615
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:09,040
这种表演不是办法
That ain't the way this plays out.

616
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:12,200
把他带上来
Bring him up!

617
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:25,960
艾尔
Al?

618
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:55,340
听我说 有些事很快就会发生
Listen to me. What's gonna happen will happen quick.

619
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:58,250
我会尽量拖住他们 你悄悄溜出去
I'll stall long as I can, but I want you to sneak out back

620
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:00,000
躲到罗杰的磨坊里
and hole up at Roger's mill...

621
01:13:00,150 --> 01:13:01,320
在那里等我
And wait for me there.

622
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:03,740
只有必要时才用这个
Only use this if you have to.

623
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:05,200
让我参战
Let me fight.

624
01:13:05,260 --> 01:13:07,920
如果你留下会让我没法集中精力
I can't do this right if I'm worried about protecting you.

625
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:09,300
把我交出去
Just turn me over.

626
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,280
不然他们会杀了我们所有人
You don't, they're gonna kill us all.

627
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:15,000
你我都清楚 不管怎样他们都会杀了我们
You and me both know they're fixin' to do that anyway.

628
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:17,580
你觉得我能在枪战中安全离开吗
And yet you expect me to run out into sure gunfire?

629
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:19,260
你儿子说得对
Your boy's right.

630
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:26,420
呆在里面
Stay inside.

631
01:13:26,540 --> 01:13:27,900
离窗户远点
Stay away from the window.

632
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:31,520
如果你必须开枪 瞄准胸部 然后
You have to shoot, aim for the chest, and...

633
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:33,180
继续开火 直到我击中
Keep firing till I hit something.

634
01:13:50,970 --> 01:13:54,380
我一直都怀疑你什么来头 亨利·麦卡蒂
I've had some suspicions about who you are, Henry mccarty.

635
01:13:57,020 --> 01:13:58,000
我承认
I got to admit,

636
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:01,200
这名字像根刺一样扎在我心里
that name sticks in me like a Thorn.

637
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:04,400
我的好奇心被勾起了
My curiosity was aroused.

638
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:08,160
我希望艾尔能给我们一些提示
I was hoping al here might shed some light.

639
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:11,240
但他拒绝说
He wouldn't say shit.

640
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:14,400
即使在我的人
Even after my boys were...

641
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:18,680
怎么说呢 呃 在他们的强烈要求下
What's the word? Uh, emphatic in their question.

642
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:23,070
你可能觉得我不是警长
You probably concluded I'm no sheriff.

643
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:25,840
这些人也不是我的副手
Nor are these men my deputies.

644
01:14:27,020 --> 01:14:30,480
在一个月前 我们中没人去过伍兹县
Not a one of us had spent time in woods county before a month ago.

645
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:33,500
那你呢
What about you?

646
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:36,240
你来自哪里
Where'd you come from?

647
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:39,980
除了这里 世界上任何地方
Every place on earth but this.

648
01:14:42,620 --> 01:14:43,600
就这样吧
So be it.

649
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:45,360
最后条件
Last offer.

650
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:48,800
为柯里治安官和钱
This tongue-tied piece of shit

651
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,960
准备的这堆口是心非的废话
for sheriff curry in there and the money.

652
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:52,580
你得到你想要的
You get what you want.

653
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:54,460
我得到我想要的
I get what I want.

654
01:14:55,180 --> 01:14:57,840
我们各奔东西 没有流血
We go our separate ways without blood spilled.

655
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:01,220
不是你的 不是我的
Not yours, not mine.

656
01:15:02,180 --> 01:15:04,140
也不是你那个男孩 我看到他透过
Not that boy of yours I see surveilling

657
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:05,860
窗户在监视这一切
all this through that window.

658
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:09,140
如果我想流血
If I wanted bloodshed,

659
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:12,020
我早就从那里破门而入了
I'd have busted in there guns a-blazin' a long time ago.

660
01:15:13,490 --> 01:15:14,800
我相信你明白
I believe you know that.

661
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:18,500
你把我内兄留在原地
You leave my brother-in-law right where he is.

662
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:22,300
转身离开我的房子
Turn and ride your asses off my property.

663
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:25,800
你照做 我就让你活命
You do that, and I'll let you live.

664
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:31,700
你们听到了吗 伙计们
You hear that, fellas?

665
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:35,280
这是一个温和老农说的话吗
Is that the talk of a mild old sodbuster?

666
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:36,980
我想不是
I think not.

667
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:39,200
不是
Nah.

668
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:42,080
这听起来完全是另外一回事
That sounds like something else altogether.

669
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:45,180
霍布斯
Hobbs!

670
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:49,260
你能告诉我什么事可能改变这个僵局吗
Anything you could tell me might change the equation here?

671
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:55,460
来舔我屁股 你这唠叨的混蛋
Kiss my ass, you long-winded son of a bitch.

672
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:01,540
我再给你一次机会
You got a pair, I'll give you that.

673
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:06,680
最后机会 艾尔
Last chance, al.

674
01:16:10,210 --> 01:16:12,060
你根本不知道
You have no idea

675
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:15,740
你将释放的是地狱风暴
the hell storm you fixin' to let loose.

676
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:20,820
请注意我的警告
Consider me properly warned.

677
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:28,360
冷静
Easy.

678
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:30,260
喔
Whoa.

679
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:34,900
冷静点 伙计
Easy, fella.

680
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:44,620
该死的
Goddamn.

681
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:47,280
看这个
Look at that.

682
01:16:48,410 --> 01:16:49,780
她完成了
I'd say she's done.

683
01:16:50,140 --> 01:16:51,820
这不是一件漂亮的东西吗
Ain't that a thing of beauty?

684
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:00,880
怀亚特
Wyatt!

685
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:06,500
进去
Get in!

686
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:18,020
你还和我们在一起吗
You still with us?

687
01:17:18,740 --> 01:17:19,740
别管我
Less of me.

688
01:17:21,780 --> 01:17:23,020
哇 哇
Whoa. Whoa.

689
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:31,080
麦卡蒂
Mccarty!

690
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:34,620
你死了吗
You dead yet?

691
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:36,780
当然没有
I sure ain't.

692
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:38,820
今天早上我没有看到
I'm assuming the fact I ain't seen

693
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:40,540
我的人达根
my man duggan this morning

694
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,400
这意味着他肯定和你有冲突
means he must have crossed paths with you,

695
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:45,920
事情未按他的方式进行
and things didn't go his way.

696
01:17:48,340 --> 01:17:51,020
我刚刚在这里杀了你的人
Seeing as how I just killed your man al here,

对我们来说公平了

698
01:17:54,580 --> 01:17:55,700
别再玩游戏了
No more games.

699
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,280
你有一分钟的时间出来

你差点害死我们俩

701
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:05,460
你所有的眼泪和愤怒也差不多了
which is about all your tears and rage would have amounted to.

702
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:10,800
现在把头低下 你会没事的
Now keep your damn head down. You'll be all right.

703
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:19,140
低下头
Keep your head down,

704
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:20,920
你会没事的
you'll be all right.

705
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:30,140
波和麦金尼在门廊上

加勒特闯进房子

707
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:41,400
开了两枪
Two shots...

708
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:43,080
但他
but he...

709
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:47,000
你对他们说西班牙语
And you were speaking Spanish to'em.

710
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:53,100
但他没有杀你
But he didn't kill you.

711
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:55,160
他帮你逃走了
He helped you escape.

712
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:58,120
你就是他
You're him.

713
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:02,160
他是谁
He's who?

714
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:05,980
邦尼
Bonney.

715
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,020
爸爸 他在说什么
Pa, what is he talking about?

716
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:12,150
比利小子 死了或活着

717
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:14,680
威廉·H·邦尼 更广为人知的名字是
比利小子

718
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:20,140
爸爸
Pa!

719
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:29,560
明智的选择 朋友
Smart choice, friend.

720
01:19:34,740 --> 01:19:35,700
冷静点

721
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:38,200
为时已晚

722
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:40,420
这就是你的想法

723
01:19:40,580 --> 01:19:42,250
我不知道 伙计

724
01:19:42,590 --> 01:19:43,660
他在说什么
What's he saying?

725
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:22,900
你不要逞能出去
Don't you dare step outside.

726
01:22:13,690 --> 01:22:15,970
没有人必须死

727
01:22:17,070 --> 01:22:19,100
让我走

728
01:22:19,950 --> 01:22:22,060
你可以留下钱

729
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:24,020
解下你的枪套

730
01:22:24,450 --> 01:22:25,460
快点

731
01:22:28,950 --> 01:22:30,830
你会送我进监狱吗

732
01:22:31,460 --> 01:22:34,300
是警长的 没错吧

733
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:37,140
啊
Ah.

734
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:40,400
我不担心他

735
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:41,500
啊
Aah!

736
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:43,520
去你的

737
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:26,900
妈的
Fuck.

738
01:26:54,780 --> 01:26:55,780
你没事吧
You all right?

739
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:17,040
噢
Oh.

740
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:21,700
怀亚特
Wyatt.

741
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:24,720
拿桶水和一些布来
Fetch a pail of water and some rags.

742
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:25,820
去吧
Go on.

743
01:27:33,860 --> 01:27:36,020
你肯定见过更好的日子
You've certainly seen better days.

744
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:38,340
我知道你有一张熟悉的脸
I knew you had a familiar face.

745
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:41,220
一开始我还没意识到
I just couldn't place it at first.

746
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:43,920
我们会去找医生
We'll get the doc.

747
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:46,880
但首先要止住血
First I gotta slow the bleed.

748
01:27:48,380 --> 01:27:50,560
这些年来 你是怎么躲起来的
How you manage to stay hidden all these years?

749
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:53,500
把衬衫袖子撕下来
Let's get some of this shirt off you.

750
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:55,700
用来绑住腿
I can use it to tie off this leg.

751
01:28:33,180 --> 01:28:34,240
哦 该死
Well, shit.

752
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:36,860
我希望你没看见这事
I wish you didn't see that.

753
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:46,680
就像我之前听你告诉你儿子的一样
It's just like I heard you tell your boy before.

754
01:28:47,700 --> 01:28:48,720
我没有撒谎
Ain't that I lied,

755
01:28:49,780 --> 01:28:51,840
我只是没告诉你全部真相
I just never told you the whole truth.

756
01:28:53,180 --> 01:28:54,620
你根本不是警察
Was you law at all?

757
01:28:55,420 --> 01:28:57,740
伍兹郡的治安官 就如我所说
Sheriff of woods county, just like I said.

758
01:28:59,180 --> 01:29:02,440
我和我的副手们在春天和凯彻姆签约
Me and my deputies, we signed on with ketchum back in the spring.

759
01:29:04,060 --> 01:29:05,680
我们必须接受他们的指挥
We had to take their brand.

760
01:29:07,060 --> 01:29:08,480
和他们一起做些事
Done a few jobs with'em.

761
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:11,680
但我们发现他们打算在最后一次行动中杀了我们
But we figured out they was planning to gun us down on this last go.

762
01:29:13,290 --> 01:29:15,220
所以我们想先下手为强
So we tried to beat'em to the punch.

763
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:17,760
失败后 他们一直在追捕我
Took off, and they plugged me from a distance.

764
01:29:20,030 --> 01:29:21,820
他们会追我到天涯海角
They'd have hunted me to the end of the earth.

765
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:26,040
很抱歉 我最后到了这里
I'm sorry I ended up here.

766
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:30,180
你想要的真相 是我最不愿做的事
Last thing I wanted, you wanna know the truth of it.

767
01:29:32,660 --> 01:29:34,200
因为那时你对我很好
'Cause you were good to me back then.

768
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:35,740
呵
Huh.

769
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:38,840
我永远不会相信你做了他们说的那些事
I could never square you done the things they said.

770
01:29:40,350 --> 01:29:42,500
虽然我现在确实可以相信
Though I sure as hell can believe it now.

771
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,760
我甚至不记得你了
I don't even remember you.

772
01:29:55,930 --> 01:29:59,400
为什么要记得 我只是个农场工人
Well, why would you? I was just a ranch hand.

773
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:03,080
现在我要成为杀死比利小子的人了
Now I get to be the man who killed Billy the kid.

774
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:19,220
-坚持住 我去找医生 -不
-You hold on, I'll get the doc. -No.

775
01:30:21,340 --> 01:30:22,190
爸爸
Pa.

776
01:30:22,230 --> 01:30:24,460
我能走到今天是个奇迹
It's a miracle I made it this far.

777
01:30:27,820 --> 01:30:29,240
一旦这消息传出
Once this gets out...

778
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:32,540
你会听到一些关于我的事
You gonna hear some things about me.

779
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:34,970
有些是真的
Some of it's true.

780
01:30:36,060 --> 01:30:37,340
但很多都不是
A lot of it ain't.

781
01:30:39,020 --> 01:30:40,140
实际上
Fact is...

782
01:30:42,380 --> 01:30:45,820
我甚至都不知道我是谁或是什么了
I don't even know who or what I was anymore.

783
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:51,120
我不相信救赎
I don't believe in redemption.

784
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:56,060
但一个男人可以找到一些慰藉
But a man can find some kind of solace...

785
01:30:57,940 --> 01:31:00,400
如果他有你这样的孩子要抚养
If he's got a boy like you to raise.

786
01:31:03,140 --> 01:31:04,700
世界正在发生变化
The world is changing.

787
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:08,240
你去看看吧
You go see it.

788
01:31:09,780 --> 01:31:12,680
这里不再是属于我的地方
It's a place I don't belong in no more.

789
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:17,560
我希望
I'm hoping...

790
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:20,340
你喜欢
You do.

791
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:32,180
爸爸
Pa?

792
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:34,560
爸爸
Pa?

793
01:33:16,460 --> 01:33:17,300
