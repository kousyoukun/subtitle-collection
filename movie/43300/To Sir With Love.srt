1
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,000
Those school girl days

2
00:00:15:500 --> 00:00:19,000
那段学生时代的日子

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,000
Of telling tales

4
00:00:19:500 --> 00:00:23,000
一起讲故事

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:30,000
And biting nails gone

6
00:00:23:500 --> 00:00:30,000
咬指甲的日子一去不返

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,000
But in my mind

8
00:00:30:500 --> 00:00:33,000
但在我心中

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,000
I know they will

10
00:00:34:500 --> 00:00:38,000
那些记忆

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,000
Still live on and on

12
00:00:38:500 --> 00:00:43,000
永不消逝

13
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,000
But how do you thanks someone

14
00:00:43:500 --> 00:00:47,000
但是你应该如何感谢

15
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:53,000
Who has taken you from crayons to perfume

16
00:00:47:500 --> 00:00:53,000
那个帮助你成长的人

17
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,000
Oh,it isn't easy

18
00:00:53:500 --> 00:00:57,000
这很困难

19
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,000
But I'll try

20
00:00:57:300 --> 00:01:02,000
但我会努力尝试

21
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,000
If you wanted the sky ,I would write across the sky

22
00:01:02:500 --> 00:01:07,000
如果你要天空，我会在天上

23
00:01:07:500 --> 00:01:10,000
In letters that would soar

24
00:01:07:500 --> 00:01:10,000
写下一千英尺高的

25
00:01:10:500 --> 00:01:14,000
A thousand feet high

26
00:01:10:500 --> 00:01:14,000
一句话

27
00:01:14:500 --> 00:01:19,000
To sir, with love

28
00:01:14:500 --> 00:01:19,000
致老师，我们爱你

29
00:01:22:500 --> 00:01:26,000
The time has come

30
00:01:22:500 --> 00:01:26,000
终于来临

31
00:01:26:500 --> 00:01:30,000
For closing books

32
00:01:26:500 --> 00:01:30,000
合上课本的那一刻

33
00:01:30:500 --> 00:01:35,000
And long last looks must end

34
00:01:30:500 --> 00:01:35,000
最后那长长的一瞥也不得不结束

35
00:01:37:500 --> 00:01:41,000
And as I leave

36
00:01:37:500 --> 00:01:41,000
当我们离开的时候

37
00:01:42:000 --> 00:01:46,000
I know that I am leaving

38
00:01:42:000 --> 00:01:46,000
我知道我将

39
00:01:46:500 --> 00:01:50,000
My best friend

40
00:01:46:500 --> 00:01:50,000
与我的挚友分离

41
00:01:50:500 --> 00:01:55,000
A friend who taught me right from wrong

42
00:01:50:500 --> 00:01:55,000
这位挚友教会我分辨对错

43
00:01:55:500 --> 00:02:00,000
And weak from strong, that's a lot to learn

44
00:01:55:500 --> 00:02:00,000
区分软弱和坚强，那值得我学习一生

45
00:02:01:500 --> 00:02:07,000
What what can I give you in return

46
00:02:01:500 --> 00:02:07,000
我能拿什么回报你呢

47
00:02:07:500 --> 00:02:11,000
Oh,If you wanted the moon

48
00:02:07:500 --> 00:02:11,000
如果你想要月亮

49
00:02:11:500 --> 00:02:15,000
I would try to make a start

50
00:02:11:500 --> 00:02:15,000
我会开始努力尝试

51
00:02:15:500 --> 00:02:18,000
But I would rather

52
00:02:15:500 --> 00:02:18,000
但是我宁可

53
00:02:18:500 --> 00:02:21,000
You let me give my heart

54
00:02:18:500 --> 00:02:21,000
把我的心都献给你

55
00:02:21:500 --> 00:02:27,000
To sir, with love

56
00:02:21:500 --> 00:02:27,000
致老师，我们爱你
