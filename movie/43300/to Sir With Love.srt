1
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:34,608
Those schoolgirl days of telling tales and biting nails are gone, yeah

2
00:01:37,365 --> 00:01:48,978
But in my mind I know that they live on and on

3
00:01:89,001 --> 00:01:59,777
But how do you thank someone, who has taken you from crayons to perfume?

4
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:08,303
It isn't easy, but I'll try,

5
00:02:08,452 --> 00:02:16,591
If you wanted the sky 
I would write across the sky in letters 

6
00:02:16,265 --> 00:02:29,824
That would soar a thousand feet high 
To sir, with love 

7
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:44,005
The time has come
For closing books and long last looks must end,

8
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:57,001
And as I leave,
I know that I am leaving my best friend,

9
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:07,113
A friend who taught me right from wrong,
And weak from strong,
That's a lot to learn,

10
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:15,714
What, what can I give you in return?

11
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:37,589
If you wanted the moon I would try to make a start,
But I, would rather you let me give my heart,
To Sir, with Love
