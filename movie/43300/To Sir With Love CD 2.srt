00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,171
Blimey!
Red blood.

2
00:00:04,109 --> 00:00:06,407
What do you expect, pinhead?
lnk?

3
00:00:13,018 --> 00:00:14,918
l didnt mean no harm.
lt was a joke.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,678
l didnt mean no crack, Sir.

5
00:00:16,889 --> 00:00:17,981
lts all right.

6
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:25,159
Whats with you?

7
00:00:25,631 --> 00:00:27,826
Are you addressing me, Denham?

8
00:00:28,033 --> 00:00:29,500
Potts was only being funny.

9
00:00:29,701 --> 00:00:33,569
What you calling him pinhead for
in front of chimney sweep?

10
00:00:33,772 --> 00:00:36,104
l was only joking.
Sir didnt mind.

11
00:00:36,308 --> 00:00:37,605
He said, ask anything.

12
00:00:37,809 --> 00:00:40,972
You call those questions?
Always on about his color.

13
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:44,979
Youre wasting our time.
Seales, you ought to know better.

14
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,350
What have l done?
l didnt say nothing.

15
00:00:47,552 --> 00:00:50,077
You never do,
and youre half-colored.

16
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:52,314
You sit on your ass
and keep your trap shut.

17
00:00:52,524 --> 00:00:54,389
lf they want to know,
why dont they ask you?

18
00:00:54,826 --> 00:00:56,851
lm not Sir, thats why.

19
00:00:57,996 --> 00:00:59,657
l only wish l was.

20
00:01:12,611 --> 00:01:14,203
l know whats eating you.

21
00:01:14,413 --> 00:01:16,608
You fancy him, thats what.

22
00:01:19,384 --> 00:01:21,909
This is a fine how-do-you-do,
isnt it, Potts?

23
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,418
You lay off, Denham,
you son of a bitch.

24
00:01:31,129 --> 00:01:34,587
Today, lll show you
how to make salad.

25
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,961
You mean weve to cook and all?

26
00:01:38,971 --> 00:01:40,404
Sure, why not?

27
00:01:40,605 --> 00:01:42,698
My old man never cooked nothing
in his life.

28
00:01:42,908 --> 00:01:45,274
He says thats womens work.

29
00:01:47,312 --> 00:01:51,510
But suppose youre on your own,
as you certainly will be shortly.

30
00:01:51,717 --> 00:01:55,050
Youll have to do it for yourself
sometimes, wont you?

31
00:01:58,056 --> 00:02:00,047
Not again, Sir.

32
00:02:01,593 --> 00:02:03,823
This is survival training.

33
00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:10,896
A normal English salad...

34
00:02:11,103 --> 00:02:14,971
...not fit for human consumption,
even if you remove the slugs...

35
00:02:15,173 --> 00:02:19,007
...and add a dash of the extraordinary,
a bit of mayonnaise.

36
00:02:19,444 --> 00:02:21,002
Look at this.

37
00:02:30,288 --> 00:02:32,950
Mum went to the doctor.
l didnt want to miss today.

38
00:02:33,158 --> 00:02:34,147
He wont be no trouble.

39
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,227
lts all right.

40
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,821
Sit down.
Make room over there for her.

41
00:02:46,938 --> 00:02:48,166
Okay, come on.

42
00:02:51,376 --> 00:02:53,276
Never be afraid to experiment.

43
00:02:53,478 --> 00:02:55,776
And always remember that
you can eat well...

44
00:02:55,981 --> 00:02:57,710
...even though youre broke.
See?

45
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:01,443
You ever been broke, Sir?
Real broke, skint?

46
00:03:03,688 --> 00:03:04,916
Many, many times.

47
00:03:05,123 --> 00:03:07,250
l dont understand you a bit, Sir.

48
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:08,289
l mean...

49
00:03:08,493 --> 00:03:10,518
...youre a toff and you aint.

50
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:15,489
What he means is...

51
00:03:16,134 --> 00:03:20,468
Blimey, l cant sort of put it
into words or anything.

52
00:03:20,672 --> 00:03:21,536
Well, Sir...

53
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:25,506
...youre like us, but you aint.
l mean, youre not.

54
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,042
lts kind of scary but nice.

55
00:03:28,246 --> 00:03:30,111
You know what l mean, dont you?

56
00:03:33,185 --> 00:03:34,982
l dont know how to answer you,
except to say...

57
00:03:35,187 --> 00:03:37,747
...that l teach you truths,
my truths.

58
00:03:37,956 --> 00:03:41,050
lt is kind of scary,
dealing with the truth.

59
00:03:42,227 --> 00:03:44,491
Scary and dangerous.

60
00:03:47,632 --> 00:03:52,126
Have you ever had a salad
with almonds and grapes...

61
00:03:52,337 --> 00:03:55,898
...and tomatoes and lettuce
and pineapple?

62
00:03:58,343 --> 00:04:00,243
Shes in love with you, Mark.

63
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,778
You shouldnt be so surprised.

64
00:04:03,982 --> 00:04:06,746
We have a lot of marvelous schools
now in the East End.

65
00:04:06,952 --> 00:04:09,785
lts still difficult
to get quality teachers.

66
00:04:09,988 --> 00:04:12,422
Take us,
the bottom of the pile.

67
00:04:13,058 --> 00:04:15,788
Goodness knows weve had
a scruffy lot here.

68
00:04:16,628 --> 00:04:19,188
Then along comes
Mr. Mark Thackeray...

69
00:04:19,397 --> 00:04:22,764
...big, broad, handsome,
clean, intelligent...

70
00:04:22,968 --> 00:04:26,529
...looking like
he stepped out of a bandbox.

71
00:04:26,738 --> 00:04:28,603
What do you expect?

72
00:04:28,807 --> 00:04:30,365
What do l do?

73
00:04:30,609 --> 00:04:33,134
Nothing. Just be patient.

74
00:04:34,713 --> 00:04:35,975
Thanks.

75
00:04:37,516 --> 00:04:41,680
Pamelas just finding out
shes a grown woman.

76
00:04:42,721 --> 00:04:46,384
Youre probably the only real man
shes ever met in her life.

77
00:04:46,591 --> 00:04:49,025
Dont spend too much time
alone with her.

78
00:04:50,862 --> 00:04:52,693
Why didnt you ask Gillian?

79
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:58,331
l thought youd be wiser.

80
00:05:02,607 --> 00:05:03,767
Thanks.

81
00:05:33,772 --> 00:05:36,866
Hello, Sir!
We cant have you queuing up.

82
00:05:37,075 --> 00:05:40,101
lts Sir. He teaches
our Moira up at North Quay.

83
00:05:40,312 --> 00:05:42,974
Hes only got an hour for his lunch.

84
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:45,149

85
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,318
Youll like them.
Theyre lovely.

86
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,713
Here you are, guv.

87
00:05:49,354 --> 00:05:52,084
Pennys wedding cake.

88
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,588
She got married,
so heres a bit of cake.

89
00:05:55,961 --> 00:05:57,690
Jeannie Clark.

90
00:05:58,129 --> 00:05:59,790
Yes, Miss Clark.

91
00:06:00,065 --> 00:06:03,432
That was a lovely museum outing.
Will they do it again?

92
00:06:05,303 --> 00:06:07,703
Were trying to arrange one a week.

93
00:06:07,906 --> 00:06:09,373
Thatd be lovely, wont it?

94
00:06:09,975 --> 00:06:13,604
The more education, the better.
Thats what l always say.

95
00:06:14,145 --> 00:06:17,205
lts a proper bleeder,
what with the bomb and all.

96
00:06:17,415 --> 00:06:20,407
Aint the bombs.
lts them bleeding Yanks!

97
00:06:20,619 --> 00:06:23,611
Shut your gob!
My Gerts married to a Yank.

98
00:06:23,788 --> 00:06:26,188
And a proper nice gent he is, and all.

99
00:06:26,391 --> 00:06:28,382
Keep your opinions to yourself!

100
00:06:28,593 --> 00:06:32,359
God all bloody mighty!
The entente cordiale?

101
00:06:32,564 --> 00:06:34,794
First cast the mote
out of your eye...

102
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,627
...before you cast the bomb
out of mine!

103
00:06:36,835 --> 00:06:38,735
Hes a proper faggot.
Here you are.

104
00:06:38,937 --> 00:06:40,598
Youll like them.
Thank you.

105
00:06:40,805 --> 00:06:43,035
Whos next?
Come on, girls.

106
00:06:43,241 --> 00:06:44,538
Speak up!

107
00:06:50,815 --> 00:06:55,275
l was wondering if you would give
the girls some makeup lessons.

108
00:06:56,955 --> 00:06:59,685
l think quite a few
of them would be...

109
00:07:00,325 --> 00:07:02,793
...very pretty if they knew
how to do it.

110
00:07:02,994 --> 00:07:04,689
Why, certainly!

111
00:07:10,602 --> 00:07:14,265
You are getting involved
with your children, arent you?

112
00:07:14,472 --> 00:07:17,635
lm just trying to help.
Thats the job, isnt it?

113
00:07:17,976 --> 00:07:20,171
- You want some of this?
- No, thanks.

114
00:07:20,612 --> 00:07:22,477
ls that all youre having
for lunch?

115
00:07:22,681 --> 00:07:24,376
You on a diet?

116
00:07:25,784 --> 00:07:28,184
lll tell you, lm a weak man.

117
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,417
At the moment, a little skint.

118
00:07:30,622 --> 00:07:33,557
When l eat, do l love to eat!

119
00:07:33,758 --> 00:07:36,226
l love wine,
but l just cant have a glass.

120
00:07:36,428 --> 00:07:37,827
l want the whole bottle.

121
00:07:38,063 --> 00:07:41,157
So l avoid wine
and pastrami sandwiches...

122
00:07:41,366 --> 00:07:43,061
...and baked potatoes...

123
00:07:43,268 --> 00:07:46,999
...with butter and bacon...

124
00:07:47,205 --> 00:07:51,301
...and strawberry shortcake
and cheesecake.

125
00:07:54,646 --> 00:07:57,012
But l like to eat light for lunch.

126
00:08:00,985 --> 00:08:02,213
Hows the Dare girl?

127
00:08:06,191 --> 00:08:07,852
No problems.

128
00:08:09,761 --> 00:08:12,730
- Will you stay on here, Mark?
- Till l get sorted out.

129
00:08:13,398 --> 00:08:15,059
No luck with the jobs?

130
00:08:15,266 --> 00:08:17,063
But lm plugging away.

131
00:08:19,037 --> 00:08:22,473
Remember a few weeks ago,
you thought youd lost the battle?

132
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,172
l thought you had too.

133
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,208
Theres a good angel
looking after me.

134
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:34,818
Come on.
Sort yourselves out.

135
00:08:36,588 --> 00:08:38,021
Come on, hurry up!

136
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,956
All right? Go!

137
00:08:42,627 --> 00:08:44,720
Come on, Denham. Hurry it up.

138
00:08:48,767 --> 00:08:51,930
Land on your toes.
Do it again. Next!

139
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:55,403
Next!

140
00:08:59,577 --> 00:09:01,101
Buckley!

141
00:09:01,546 --> 00:09:02,376
Come on, boy.

142
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,979

143

144
00:09:06,284 --> 00:09:08,081
Youre a fat boy.
Come on.

145
00:09:08,286 --> 00:09:10,117
lm waiting.
Get that jelly off!

146
00:09:10,321 --> 00:09:12,619
Fats cant do it.
lts too high for him.

147
00:09:12,824 --> 00:09:14,348
Of course, he cant do it!

148
00:09:17,061 --> 00:09:18,892
When l want your opinion,
lll ask, boy.

149
00:09:19,097 --> 00:09:21,190
- Lm not a boy.
- Shut up!

150
00:09:24,202 --> 00:09:26,363
Buckley, do as youre told!

151
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,126
- Move out of the way, boy.
- Shut up!

152
00:09:53,731 --> 00:09:54,561

153
00:09:55,934 --> 00:09:56,798
l dont know.

154
00:10:03,575 --> 00:10:04,803
You bloody bastard!

155
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:06,306
Put that down!

156
00:10:06,511 --> 00:10:09,571
You knew Fats couldnt do that.
You had it in for him.

157
00:10:10,081 --> 00:10:11,446
Potter, put that down!

158
00:10:16,888 --> 00:10:18,412
Theyre fighting in the gym!

159
00:10:20,859 --> 00:10:22,292
Come on, Potts!

160
00:10:27,465 --> 00:10:29,023
That was no accident!

161
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,903
lll take that.

162
00:10:38,776 --> 00:10:40,209
Go and help Buckley.

163
00:10:40,411 --> 00:10:41,605
Go on!

164
00:10:46,217 --> 00:10:49,118
Potts should have done the bastard
like he did Fats.

165
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:02,633
You all right, boy?

166
00:11:02,834 --> 00:11:05,200
Yes, thank you.
Me stomach didnt half hurt.

167
00:11:05,403 --> 00:11:08,497
Jackson, lngram?
Help him up to Mrs. Evans.

168
00:11:13,778 --> 00:11:15,075
All right.

169
00:11:15,947 --> 00:11:17,380
What happened?

170
00:11:32,931 --> 00:11:34,455
Buckleys all right.

171
00:11:35,366 --> 00:11:37,766
More frightened than anything else.

172
00:11:40,305 --> 00:11:42,466
Whyd you make him do that jump?

173
00:11:43,408 --> 00:11:46,104
He just stood there
and refused to obey.

174
00:11:46,311 --> 00:11:49,974
When he jumped, he sent the buck flying
and l couldnt catch him.

175
00:11:52,417 --> 00:11:55,511
Thanks for helping me out.
That Potter went berserk.

176
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:03,791
l understand that Buckley is
a pet whipping boy of yours.

177
00:12:03,995 --> 00:12:05,155
ls that right?

178
00:12:07,198 --> 00:12:10,065
ld better report it.
Therell be the devil to pay.

179
00:12:41,132 --> 00:12:44,727
Potter, l cant think of anything
that excuses your behavior.

180
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,667
But it was him!
He made Fats do it.

181
00:12:47,872 --> 00:12:51,569
Fats said he couldnt do it.
The bully always had it in for him.

182
00:12:51,876 --> 00:12:54,401
l am not concerned with
Mr. Bells behavior, but yours.

183
00:12:54,612 --> 00:12:57,103
What if a gun or knife
had been handy?

184
00:12:57,749 --> 00:12:59,717
Potter was narked.
We was all narked.

185
00:12:59,917 --> 00:13:02,044
That bleeder was wrong
and you know it.

186
00:13:02,253 --> 00:13:04,847
Youre missing the point.
You all are.

187
00:13:05,056 --> 00:13:07,320
Soon, you will be out in the world.

188
00:13:07,525 --> 00:13:09,993
Will you use a weapon every time
someone angers you?

189
00:13:10,361 --> 00:13:13,023
Youre supposed to
be learning self-discipline.

190
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,890
You owe Mr. Bell an apology.

191
00:13:19,871 --> 00:13:23,307
Why?
Just because Bell is a teacher?

192
00:13:23,508 --> 00:13:25,533
You better answer that, Potter.

193
00:13:25,743 --> 00:13:28,109
Do you think you behaved
like an adult?

194
00:13:40,324 --> 00:13:42,315
How about Bell
apologizing to Buckley?

195
00:13:43,628 --> 00:13:46,927
My business is with you,
not Mr. Bell.

196
00:13:47,131 --> 00:13:50,294
lts easy for you to talk.
No one pushes you around.

197
00:13:54,338 --> 00:13:55,965
Are you a man or a hoodlum?

198
00:14:00,344 --> 00:14:01,936
Do it, Potts!

199
00:14:03,614 --> 00:14:05,912
Or Bell will call the law
if you dont.

200
00:14:06,718 --> 00:14:09,744
Youve got to have recommends
for a job in a couple weeks.

201
00:14:09,954 --> 00:14:11,182
Hes got to sign one.

202
00:14:12,457 --> 00:14:15,085
This has nothing
to do with what l sign.

203
00:14:15,626 --> 00:14:17,457
You cant trust a teacher.

204
00:14:17,662 --> 00:14:20,392
Were only safe together.
Against them.

205
00:14:20,598 --> 00:14:22,793
But Sir is different.
lf he says Potts...

206
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,628
That he is, and hes wrong now.

207
00:14:26,537 --> 00:14:29,665
You all know Bells been after
old Fats for years.

208
00:14:34,378 --> 00:14:35,970
Go on, Potts.

209
00:14:46,057 --> 00:14:48,821
lf you apologize
because youre afraid...

210
00:14:49,026 --> 00:14:52,120
...then youre a child, not a man.

211
00:15:01,372 --> 00:15:04,307
When l leave,
lll have me own barrow.

212
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:08,912
So you cant touch me,
letters or no letters.

213
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,227
lm sorry lm late, Sir.

214
00:15:33,805 --> 00:15:35,363
But its me mum.

215
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,967
Shes dead.

216
00:15:40,745 --> 00:15:43,111
lve been helping me dad
with her things.

217
00:15:47,819 --> 00:15:51,755
- L didnt know where to go, Sir.
- Thats all right.

218
00:15:52,824 --> 00:15:55,418
lngram, take over the class.

219
00:16:17,348 --> 00:16:20,317
l understand that
the passing out class holds...

220
00:16:20,518 --> 00:16:23,885
...some kind of a celebration
at the end of term.

221
00:16:24,088 --> 00:16:25,555
What happens?

222
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:32,826
We dance...

223
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,463
...Sir.

224
00:16:38,102 --> 00:16:40,127
Did you apologize because of Denham?

225
00:16:44,976 --> 00:16:47,171
One should fight
for what one believes...

226
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,912
...provided one is absolutely sure...

227
00:16:51,115 --> 00:16:53,709
...one is absolutely right.

228
00:16:55,253 --> 00:16:56,686
Pass these out.

229
00:17:07,899 --> 00:17:09,924
You have to fill those out...

230
00:17:10,768 --> 00:17:13,896
...for national health insurance
and so on.

231
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,198
What are you doing, Jackson?

232
00:17:44,936 --> 00:17:47,336
lts for Seales.
For flowers and a wreath.

233
00:17:49,106 --> 00:17:51,131
Thats wonderful of you.

234
00:17:51,542 --> 00:17:54,340
May l be permitted
to contribute something?

235
00:17:54,545 --> 00:17:56,638
No, thank you, Mr. Thackeray.

236
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,145
Here, Pam, you buy the wreath.

237
00:18:01,652 --> 00:18:02,983
The names Dare.

238
00:18:03,187 --> 00:18:04,313
Miss Dare.

239
00:18:04,522 --> 00:18:06,114
Well, you buy the wreath.

240
00:18:06,724 --> 00:18:09,022
Send it around when the times right.

241
00:18:10,461 --> 00:18:13,157
Send it?
Arent you going to take it?

242
00:18:18,436 --> 00:18:20,836
You dont think
girls could take it, do you?

243
00:18:21,272 --> 00:18:23,297
Well, why not?

244
00:18:38,556 --> 00:18:41,047
lts what people would say, Sir.

245
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:43,726
What the family would say...

246
00:18:44,428 --> 00:18:48,057
...if they saw us going
into a colored persons home.

247
00:18:48,933 --> 00:18:50,924
Weve got nothing against you, Sir.

248
00:18:51,135 --> 00:18:52,363
Honest.

249
00:18:53,204 --> 00:18:55,172
But if one of us was to...

250
00:18:55,373 --> 00:18:57,705
You cant imagine the things be said.

251
00:19:24,402 --> 00:19:28,304
Thank you, Miss Pegg,
for making it clear.

252
00:19:31,675 --> 00:19:34,872
Does that apply to the men also?

253
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,909
Youre dead right it does.

254
00:19:47,124 --> 00:19:48,250
lll take the flowers.

255
00:19:52,663 --> 00:19:54,290
Why should you do that?

256
00:19:54,498 --> 00:19:56,762
Wouldnt that make you
subject to gossip?

257
00:19:57,368 --> 00:20:01,634
Gossip dont worry me.
lve known Seales since kindergarten.

258
00:20:02,306 --> 00:20:04,331
lll take the flowers.

259
00:20:05,009 --> 00:20:07,443
l wouldnt if l were you.

260
00:20:32,369 --> 00:20:34,098
lve been looking for you.

261
00:20:34,305 --> 00:20:36,967
Theres a lady to see you.
Mrs. Dare.

262
00:20:38,676 --> 00:20:42,976
And by the way, lve canceled
all outings for your class.

263
00:20:44,148 --> 00:20:45,308
Why?

264
00:20:45,616 --> 00:20:47,447
The adult approach hasnt worked.

265
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:50,382
ltd have been better
to let things be.

266
00:20:50,588 --> 00:20:54,149
You take your boys in for P.T.
until l get a replacement.

267
00:21:07,972 --> 00:21:11,567
lm sorry to disturb you, Sir.
lts about Pam.

268
00:21:11,775 --> 00:21:12,867
lm Mrs. Dare.

269
00:21:13,077 --> 00:21:16,274
What can l do for you?
Would you have a seat?

270
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,109
Would you talk to her, Sir?
lm sure shed listen to you.

271
00:21:20,317 --> 00:21:22,581
- Shes always talking about you.
- Whats the problem?

272
00:21:26,023 --> 00:21:28,787
She always stays out
late at night, Sir.

273
00:21:28,993 --> 00:21:31,484
Often she doesnt get home
till past 11.

274
00:21:32,096 --> 00:21:34,326
She never says where shes been.

275
00:21:34,532 --> 00:21:37,296
Shes a big girl.
lm worried about her.

276
00:21:38,102 --> 00:21:39,296
She wont listen to me.

277
00:21:41,138 --> 00:21:42,969
lm just a teacher, Mrs. Dare.

278
00:21:43,174 --> 00:21:44,766
l know shed listen to you.

279
00:21:44,975 --> 00:21:48,411
lts always 创Sir said this创
or 创Sir said that. 创

280
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:54,042
See, she wont listen to me.
She just wont.

281
00:21:54,785 --> 00:21:56,446
Why doesnt her father
talk with her?

282
00:21:58,923 --> 00:22:00,823
Were divorced.

283
00:22:01,025 --> 00:22:03,789
Hes up north somewhere.
He doesnt...

284
00:22:06,564 --> 00:22:09,158
lts not wrong to...

285
00:22:10,701 --> 00:22:14,137
When your marriage breaks up,
life doesnt end, does it?

286
00:22:15,105 --> 00:22:18,472
Please talk to her, Sir.
lm frightened for her.

287
00:22:18,676 --> 00:22:22,237
You never know what sort
of trouble she can get into.

288
00:22:23,881 --> 00:22:25,041
Please.

289
00:22:28,385 --> 00:22:30,319
All right, l will.

290
00:22:31,155 --> 00:22:32,486
Thank you.

291
00:23:31,649 --> 00:23:32,911
Morning, Sir.

292
00:23:33,651 --> 00:23:34,549
Hello, love.

293
00:23:34,752 --> 00:23:37,414
- Morning.
- How are you? Hows the kids?

294
00:23:37,755 --> 00:23:38,653
Hello, guv!

295
00:23:41,592 --> 00:23:43,856
Hello, Sir.
lts a lovely day, isnt it?

296
00:23:44,094 --> 00:23:46,460
Your kid aint top of the class.

297
00:24:07,951 --> 00:24:10,545
My, you look as if
youve won the pools.

298
00:24:10,954 --> 00:24:11,921
Better!

299
00:24:12,122 --> 00:24:15,114
l got me a job.
A real one for when school ends.

300
00:24:15,326 --> 00:24:18,056
Assistant engineer
in a factory in the Midlands.

301
00:24:18,262 --> 00:24:20,753
They even sent me the fare!

302
00:24:20,964 --> 00:24:22,226
Thats marvelous.

303
00:24:22,433 --> 00:24:25,300
lts not that good,
but its a start after so long.

304
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,570
Do you think
shell take the flowers?

305
00:24:28,972 --> 00:24:30,303
l dont know.

306
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:35,207
Go in. Sir wants you.

307
00:24:50,027 --> 00:24:52,621
Sit down.
ld like to talk to you.

308
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:55,030
Has my mum been in?

309
00:24:58,969 --> 00:25:02,063
The funeral was Saturday, 10:30.

310
00:25:05,642 --> 00:25:07,166
About my mum, Sir?

311
00:25:07,378 --> 00:25:10,245
Shes very worried about you,
Miss Dare.

312
00:25:11,181 --> 00:25:13,081
Couldnt you call me Pamela?

313
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:17,649
l think not, for the moment.

314
00:25:17,888 --> 00:25:21,221
She says that
youve been staying out late.

315
00:25:21,425 --> 00:25:25,623
lve just been to Grans.
Just around the corner, not far.

316
00:25:26,563 --> 00:25:28,554
Why havent you told your mother?

317
00:25:28,766 --> 00:25:30,427
She doesnt care about me.

318
00:25:30,634 --> 00:25:32,727
You know thats not true.

319
00:25:36,407 --> 00:25:37,840
Youre not in trouble, are you?

320
00:25:40,477 --> 00:25:43,002
Nowadays thats only for fools,
isnt it?

321
00:25:43,914 --> 00:25:46,678
Were the luckiest kids,
the luckiest generation...

322
00:25:46,884 --> 00:25:49,352
...thats ever been, arent we?

323
00:25:49,553 --> 00:25:53,785
Were the first to be really free
to enjoy life if we want...

324
00:25:53,991 --> 00:25:55,288
...without fear.

325
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,059
What is the trouble?

326
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:01,725
lf you dont want to talk,
say the word.

327
00:26:02,866 --> 00:26:04,390
lt doesnt bother me.

328
00:26:05,235 --> 00:26:08,227
lt was all right
up till about a year ago.

329
00:26:08,672 --> 00:26:11,539
Of course, l miss Daddy.
He was wonderful.

330
00:26:12,109 --> 00:26:14,304
But its just one of those things.

331
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,910
Mum works up in a dress shop
on the West End.

332
00:26:19,249 --> 00:26:21,012
And we got on fine.

333
00:26:22,853 --> 00:26:25,617
Then men friends started
calling on her.

334
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:28,954
You know what neighbors are like.

335
00:26:31,061 --> 00:26:33,757
Thats all.
Theres nothing else to tell.

336
00:26:36,266 --> 00:26:39,463
She doesnt like me.
lm in the way.

337
00:26:40,204 --> 00:26:42,434
Shes young and pretty, isnt she?

338
00:26:42,973 --> 00:26:45,305
lll be glad to leave school
and be on my own.

339
00:26:47,177 --> 00:26:49,372
Obviously, your mother loves you.

340
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,946
And you owe her much more
than any teacher.

341
00:26:52,149 --> 00:26:54,617
l think youre wrong about her.

342
00:26:54,818 --> 00:26:59,380
Did she tell you that l found her
with one of her friends?

343
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,785
At home? At my home?

344
00:27:02,459 --> 00:27:04,757
No, l bet she didnt,
but she was!

345
00:27:06,096 --> 00:27:10,089
l cant solve your problems for you.
But staying out late wont help.

346
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,791
lt helps me.
l cant stand the sight of her!

347
00:27:13,003 --> 00:27:15,471
And if you were me,
youd feel the same.

348
00:27:15,639 --> 00:27:19,097
lm in no position to judge.
l know people make mistakes.

349
00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:20,708
Youre saying its my fault?

350
00:27:20,911 --> 00:27:24,142
Forgiveness is the gift of God.
People make mistakes.

351
00:27:24,348 --> 00:27:26,111
lts up to you to make peace.

352
00:27:26,717 --> 00:27:29,982
- Why should l? Lve done nothing.
- Grow up.

353
00:27:30,287 --> 00:27:32,221
Give her another chance.

354
00:27:32,623 --> 00:27:34,955
Why are you taking her side?

355
00:27:35,492 --> 00:27:38,893
Youre wrong not to give her a chance.
Everybody deserves that.

356
00:27:41,532 --> 00:27:45,491
l thought youd understand.
l thought l could trust you.

357
00:27:45,702 --> 00:27:49,661
But youre just as Denham said.
lm not taking the bloody flowers!

358
00:28:42,626 --> 00:28:43,991
All right.

359
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:48,355
Lets line up here
in the center.

360
00:28:48,765 --> 00:28:50,858
Could we box first today, please?

361
00:28:54,237 --> 00:28:55,135
Why?

362
00:28:55,339 --> 00:28:56,931
lt would make a change.

363
00:28:58,875 --> 00:29:01,343
Just sort yourselves in pairs now.

364
00:29:02,379 --> 00:29:05,906
Do you mind having a go with me?
Sapianos hurt his wrist.

365
00:29:06,116 --> 00:29:07,708
Thats right. L sprained it.

366
00:29:12,255 --> 00:29:17,124
l think you ought to wait and have a go
at Potter or one of the others.

367
00:29:17,327 --> 00:29:19,090
Hell be done in, Sir.

368
00:29:21,098 --> 00:29:23,794
l dont mind having
a punch-out with you.

369
00:29:26,837 --> 00:29:29,635
l think youd better
forget that for today.

370
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,739
Lets go!

371
00:29:50,727 --> 00:29:51,557
Lets go.

372
00:31:03,867 --> 00:31:05,391
Stay where you are!

373
00:31:09,272 --> 00:31:10,762
Put your head down.

374
00:31:14,077 --> 00:31:16,477
Collect the gloves and put them back.

375
00:31:16,913 --> 00:31:19,473
The rest of you,
line up for vaulting.

376
00:31:22,486 --> 00:31:23,976
Put your head down.

377
00:31:27,724 --> 00:31:29,123
You all right?

378
00:31:30,794 --> 00:31:33,388
- Come over here for a minute.
- Lm all right.

379
00:31:39,803 --> 00:31:41,771
l think lll go wash up.

380
00:31:52,115 --> 00:31:53,412
You all right, mate?

381
00:31:53,617 --> 00:31:54,811
Are you sure?

382
00:32:06,429 --> 00:32:08,454
Can l ask you something?

383
00:32:08,665 --> 00:32:11,395
- How many times did you hit me?
- Once.

384
00:32:12,035 --> 00:32:14,435
lm sorry,
l didnt mean to hurt you.

385
00:32:14,638 --> 00:32:16,037
l lost my temper.

386
00:32:16,373 --> 00:32:17,897
l was meaning to hurt you.

387
00:32:18,108 --> 00:32:20,872
You did.
Youre pretty good.

388
00:32:21,077 --> 00:32:22,840
Why didnt you hit me again?

389
00:32:23,513 --> 00:32:25,538
Why didnt you fight?
You had me easy.

390
00:32:25,749 --> 00:32:27,979
lve been after you
since you got here.

391
00:32:28,185 --> 00:32:30,210
Are you afraid or something?

392
00:32:32,589 --> 00:32:35,387
Hitting you wouldnt solve much,
would it?

393
00:32:35,592 --> 00:32:38,561
lts the truth.
l dont understand you at all.

394
00:32:39,729 --> 00:32:40,923
Whats a barrow?

395
00:32:41,131 --> 00:32:45,568
A barrow? With fruit on it.
A barrow!

396
00:32:45,836 --> 00:32:47,633
You was wrong about Potts.

397
00:32:47,971 --> 00:32:50,940
Yes, from his point of view,
at his age, l was.

398
00:32:51,141 --> 00:32:54,201
- The girls was right about the gossip.
- From their point of view.

399
00:32:54,411 --> 00:32:56,106
What other point is there?

400
00:32:56,313 --> 00:32:58,907
You have to figure that out
for yourself.

401
00:33:07,023 --> 00:33:10,049
Would you like a job teaching
the youngsters how to box?

402
00:33:11,795 --> 00:33:16,061
lll speak with Mr. Florian.
There will be some money for you.

403
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:18,698
Me? A bleeding teacher?

404
00:33:18,902 --> 00:33:22,303
lts important the youngsters
know how to defend themselves.

405
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,807
Why are you doing this?

406
00:33:25,008 --> 00:33:28,000
Good luck with your barrow.

407
00:33:52,535 --> 00:33:55,936
Whats the matter?
You going to a bleeding wedding?

408
00:33:58,208 --> 00:34:00,574
You dont half pong, Potts!

409
00:34:01,511 --> 00:34:04,173
- Whats up with you, Fats?
- Nothing, Bert.

410
00:34:05,749 --> 00:34:08,183
Another week
and well be through here.

411
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,848
l aint got a job yet.

412
00:34:14,991 --> 00:34:17,152
You had the bleeder yesterday.
Lucky punch.

413
00:34:19,629 --> 00:34:22,325
You got eyes in back of your head.

414
00:34:22,532 --> 00:34:25,501
He could have done me
with one hand behind his back.

415
00:34:25,702 --> 00:34:29,695
And none of your bleeding here.
Theres ladies present.

416
00:34:33,743 --> 00:34:38,203
What Sir said about the truth,
its kind of scary, isnt it?

417
00:34:40,617 --> 00:34:42,084
Good morning.

418
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:46,917
About the party,
weve got a group and all.

419
00:34:47,123 --> 00:34:49,853
And the girls is fixing the grub.
You coming?

420
00:34:52,629 --> 00:34:53,493
You inviting me?

421
00:34:54,731 --> 00:34:56,460
Yeah, youre invited.

422
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,624
Thank you.

423
00:34:59,636 --> 00:35:01,331
lf l can, l certainly will.

424
00:35:04,341 --> 00:35:07,902
What you said is right,
about a man making up his own mind.

425
00:36:51,481 --> 00:36:53,176
My goodness!

426
00:36:53,817 --> 00:36:55,944
You certainly look lovely.

427
00:36:56,419 --> 00:36:57,477
Thank you.

428
00:36:59,189 --> 00:37:01,783
Would you dance with me tonight?

429
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,257
Of course.

430
00:37:05,462 --> 00:37:08,625
But nothing too fast.
l am getting too old for that.

431
00:37:09,332 --> 00:37:11,197
Well make it special.
Promise?

432
00:37:11,468 --> 00:37:12,662
Promise.

433
00:37:13,203 --> 00:37:14,363
Thank you.

434
00:37:16,973 --> 00:37:19,874
Would you call me Pamela tonight?

435
00:37:23,546 --> 00:37:24,376
Pamela.

436
00:37:26,583 --> 00:37:27,845
Thank you.

437
00:37:48,705 --> 00:37:51,299
Excuse me a minute, Bert.

441
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:04,243

- Come on, lll tell you.

442
00:38:45,128 --> 00:38:46,561
Good evening.

443
00:38:46,763 --> 00:38:48,321
l hear youre leaving.

444
00:38:49,132 --> 00:38:50,429

lm sorry about that.
Youre damn good.

446
00:38:53,002 --> 00:38:54,765
Youve done wonders for this show.

447
00:38:55,171 --> 00:38:57,401
Thank you very much.

448
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:01,337
Anybody can be an engineer,
but teaching this mob is...

449
00:39:01,544 --> 00:39:03,705
l wish l had your gift.

450
00:39:04,714 --> 00:39:06,909
Why so serious, Mark?

451
00:39:07,116 --> 00:39:09,380
Good God, its Weston!

452
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,351
Wrap up, Clinty.

453
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:15,021
Well, lm damned!

454
00:39:16,025 --> 00:39:18,619
He wasnt giving you
a hard time, was he?

455
00:39:18,828 --> 00:39:20,455
On the contrary.

456
00:39:52,562 --> 00:39:56,828
Will you wave your magic wand
and make me sweet 16 again?

457
00:39:57,834 --> 00:39:59,028
Nothing to do with me.

458
00:39:59,469 --> 00:40:02,404
A fine lad.
Your hands in this, all right.

459
00:40:16,386 --> 00:40:19,150
lf you must leave,
go to another school.

460
00:40:19,889 --> 00:40:22,323
You cant waste your talent
on electronics.

461
00:40:23,426 --> 00:40:25,894
Damn!
l swore l wouldnt interfere.

462
00:40:48,851 --> 00:40:50,614
Would you like some more?

463
00:40:51,554 --> 00:40:53,545

- What is it?
- Pageboy at the Hilton.

474
00:41:32,862 --> 00:41:35,353
He cant wait to get
all that Yankee money.

475
00:41:35,565 --> 00:41:37,089
Youre right there.

476
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,495
l dont want to be
a pageboy all me life.

477
00:41:39,702 --> 00:41:42,000
Will you help me get
into night school?

478
00:41:42,205 --> 00:41:43,433
ld be glad to.

479
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:45,129
Ta, Sir.

480
00:41:45,341 --> 00:41:47,502
You aint half a dolly, miss.

481
00:41:48,945 --> 00:41:50,105
Ready, Pam.

482
00:41:53,149 --> 00:41:54,514
Attention, everybody!

483
00:41:55,651 --> 00:41:59,087
By special request,
its a ladys choice.

484
00:42:04,727 --> 00:42:05,659
Hold that, please.

485
