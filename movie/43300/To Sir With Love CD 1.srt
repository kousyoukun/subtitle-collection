00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:17,094
My bleeding feet!

2
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,233
Hello, Mrs. Joseph.

3
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,907
l like your hair.
ls that strawberry blonde?

4
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:23,803
Youre only jealous.

5
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,843
What you got for
the old mans supper tonight?

6
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:30,038
Hell be lucky to get
faggots and pease pudd, he will.

7
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,185
Well, he cant do much on that,
can he?

8
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:38,088
All l want him for
is to keep me feet warm.

9
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,153
Excuse me, dearie.

10
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:41,457
Here, Gert.

11
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:45,927
l wouldnt mind having this little lot
in my stocking for Christmas.

12
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:49,327
You wouldnt know what to do with him.
Youve been a widow too long.

13
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:50,935
You speak for yourself.

14
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:54,732
lts like riding a bicycle.
You never forget how.

15
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:58,404
Here, lll tell you what lll do.

16
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:01,739
lll send my Alfie to you.
Hes not bad once he gets going.

17
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:05,307
Well, l hope hes well-sprung.

18
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:52,961
Morning.

19
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:55,601
Looking for someone?

20
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,638
Nice day, isnt it?

21
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,248
Sorry.

22
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:59,092
Hackmans in the staff room.

23
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,767
Where he bleeding well belongs.

24
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,152
Good morning.

25
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,316
My name is Thackeray.
lm a new teacher.

26
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:30,459
We were expecting you.

27
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:34,257
So youre the new lamb
for the slaughter.

28
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,160
Or should l say...

29
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:37,631
...black sheep?

30
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,332
No, just a teacher, Mr. Hackman.

31
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:43,398
lm not Hackman.
Perish the thought.

32
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,340
Hes departed,
God rest his soul.

33
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:50,577
Hes probably pouring out his woes
to the divisional officer by now.

34
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:52,477
Weston.

35
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,487
lm Mrs. Evans, Grace.
Deputy head.

36
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,884
Mrs. Evans.

37
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,889
Have you seen any
of the children yet?

38
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:04,086
l looked in on Mr. Hackmans class
for a moment.

39
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:07,191
l take them for domestic science.

40
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:09,998
Like a cup of tea?

41
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:12,601
No, thank you, not just now.

42
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,098
You been teaching long?

43
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,509
This is my first appointment.

44
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,140
We call them jobs.

45
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:22,541
American, are you?

46
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:23,579
British...

47
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:24,875
...from British Guiana.

48
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:27,143
But l spent some years
in the States.

49
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:30,015
- Where?
- Ln California.

50
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,357
Weather as good as they say?

51
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:33,582
lts better.

52
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:38,692
What was your subject?

53
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,398
What did you major in?

54
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:43,669
Engineering.

55
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:48,297
l must be off.

56
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:49,902
Make yourself at home.

57
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,202
Wander around, if you like,
or stay here.

58
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,403
lll introduce you
to the others at lunch.

59
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:55,672
Thank you.

60
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:36,915
This is Gillian, Mr. Thackeray.

61
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,289
Gillian Blanchard.

62
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:42,252
Shes new here too.

63
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,726
Came the day before yesterday.

64
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:46,959
- Tea, Gillian?
- Thank you.

65
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,734
This is Mr. Mark Thackeray,
the new replacement.

66
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,135
Jose Dawes,
Euphemia Phillips.

67
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,207
They teach the little ones.

68
00:07:58,411 --> 00:07:59,810
Theo Weston, you know.

69
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:02,810
Yes, lve had the pleasure.
He mistook me for Hackman.

70
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:04,915
- L heard hes fled.
- Cant say l blame him.

71
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:07,108
That shot of humanitys enough
to destroy anyone.

72
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,015
He got what he deserved.

73
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:10,852
lm Clinty Clintridge.

74
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,684
Clintys a marvelous artist.

75
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:15,725
Got one at the Royal Academy
a couple of years ago.

76
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:17,793
Teaching provides
the bread and butter.

77
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,966
Well, thats all the staff
except for Mr. Bell...

78
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,896
...our P.T. instructor.

79
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:25,070
l do hope youre
going to stay with us.

80
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,806
l shouldnt if l were you, old man.

81
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,338
Row home while you can.

82
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,800
Dont discourage him, Weston.

83
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:34,807
Well, l must go.

84
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,812
l have to fix a bath
for a girl in Clintys class.

85
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:38,984
Why?

86
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,449
Kids are complaining again.
Wont sit near her.

87
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:42,746
Whats the matter?

88
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:44,820
Personal hygiene problems.

89
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,821
Fourteen and helpless.

90
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,017
You men are lucky.

91
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:52,725
The things we women have to do
for these kids.

92
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:54,291
Gillian, dear...

93
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,296
...encourage him to stay.

94
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,806
Why is it everyone thinks
l need encouraging?

95
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:07,843
They said the same to me.

96
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:12,581
Theres something frightening but
also challenging about this school.

97
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:16,243
Theres no form of corporal
punishment or any punishment.

98
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:17,615
None?

99
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:20,519
l have no real teaching experience.
lm a little lost.

100
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,717
l dont have any experience either.

101
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,455
Of course, itll be
much easier for you.

102
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:29,334
lm a little afraid of them.

103
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:31,533
Midday dance session.

104
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,637
During lunch,
the older kids use the hall.

105
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,466
l sometimes join them.

106
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,370
Even the old man
shakes a leg on occasions.

107
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,205
Dancing is merely their way
of keeping fit...

108
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:44,008
...for the more exciting pastime
of teacher baiting.

109
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:46,446
Couldnt you be
a bit less discouraging?

110
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:48,950
lts the last thing l want to do.

111
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,756
The musics louder than usual.

112
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,984
Theyre probably celebrating
their victory over Hackman.

113
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,823
l better go and see Mr. Florian.

114
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,657
lll show you the way.

115
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:36,225
Theyre good, arent they?

116
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:37,629
l suppose so.

117
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,964
The heads study is this way.

118
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,441
Do you two...

119
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,112
Do you two shake?

120
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,784
Well, lll see you later,
Mr. Thackeray.

121
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:01,254
Well?

122
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:07,599
Thank you.

123
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,132
But l have to go
and see the principal.

124
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:30,781
You have excellent qualifications,
astonishing ones, in fact...

125
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,617
...as a communications engineer.

126
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:35,894
Field experience in South America.

127
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,090
Why do you want to be a teacher?

128
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:39,427
Reasons.

129
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:42,226
Youve already tried to get
an engineering post?

130
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:43,902
l tried for 18 months, sir.

131
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,131
We have no blueprint in North Quay.

132
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:54,070
Most of our children are
rejects from other schools.

133
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,714
We have to help and teach them
as best we can...

134
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,611
...and as much as we can.

135
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:01,753
The local authorities are not
totally on our side.

136
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:04,388
And from the moment
you accept this position...

137
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,057
...youll be entirely on your own.

138
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:09,694
Of course, l and the staff will do
everything we can to help you.

139
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:13,194
But success or failure
will depend entirely upon you.

140
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,630
Whats it to be?

141
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,297
l want the job, sir.

142
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:19,801
Good.

143
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:21,370
Then its settled.

144
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,836
Tomorrow, youll take over
Hackmans class.

145
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:25,669
Sapiano.

146
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:27,603
Wong.

147
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,241
Osgood.

148
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:32,115
Tuffen.

149
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,086
Pegg.

150
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,088
Pegg?

151
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,616
Joseph.

152
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:42,685
Dare.

153
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:46,396
Potter.

154
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,288
Potter.

155
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:50,102
Denham.

156
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:54,337
Buckley.

157
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,666
Purcell.

158
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:00,035
Fernman.

159
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:02,070
Jackson.

160
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:04,778
Strong.

161
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,312
Seales.

162
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:13,116
- Palmer.
- Yes, guvnor.

163
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:15,153
Campbell.

164
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:16,225
Present.

165
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:22,492
l dont know how much you know,
so well start from scratch.

166
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:24,601
First, as l call your name...

167
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:28,570
...will you read anything you like
from one of your school books?

168
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:31,635

...began slightly to impede
the wild mares speed.

182

But Pete was only too fully aware
of what his fate would be...

183
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,027
...for he could not hope
to escape death...

...for this in such as him
seemed strange of mood.

192

But thus it was.

Cheeky devil.

Hello, ducks.

212
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,934
Thought you might need this.

00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,405
Howd it go?

214
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,872
Lets just say, battle was joined.

215

l dont know what wed do
without a cuppa.

00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:10,255
Couple of things, Mark.

220
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:13,157
We all know the old mans views.

221
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,560
And basically, we agree with them.

222
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:18,129
But hes safe in an office.

223
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:22,431
These kids come from homes where
an order is accompanied by a blow.

224
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:25,974
One rude word to their parents,
the roof will hit them.

225
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,044
Theres nothing like that
going on here, right?

226
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:33,747
So theyve got us
at a great disadvantage.

227
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:39,751
Hackman tried to be popular.
He hung himself.

228
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:43,618
Weston couldnt care less
about them, and thats no good.

229
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,461
l cant guide you...

230
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,972
...but dont take any nonsense
from these little tykes.

231
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:59,075
Theyre good kids, Mark,
most of them.

232
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:05,344
But if you dont solve them,
theyll break you, and damn quickly.

233
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:06,950
Thats been tried...

234
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:08,312
...by experts.

235
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:11,847
Theyre very expert.

236
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,149
Please, can l leave the room, guv?

237
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,595
Yes, and its Thackeray.

238
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,458
Yes, guv.

239
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,435
Most of you girls help your mothers
with the shopping.

240
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:34,836
So sorry, Mr. 创Fackeray. 创

241

Proper drafty in these parts,
isnt it?

242
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:42,512
About multiplying...

243
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,113
...there are
a few valuable tricks to know.

244
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:50,853
Say that youre offered roast beef
at seven shillings per pound.

245

Potter.

246
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:54,563
Must you do that?

247
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,331
l cant help it, Sir.
lts me desk.

248

lll speak with the caretaker
about it after school.

251
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:34,166
lsnt he nice?

252
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:38,633
l hope l didnt miss nothing.

253
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,108
Where was we?
About shopping or something...

254
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:43,372
Thats enough, Denham.

255
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:45,516
l was only asking, Mr. Fackeray.

256
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:47,184
l dont want to miss nothing.

257
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:51,550
Bert, he was just about to show us
a new and valuable trick.

258
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:53,224
When youre shopping, you see...

259
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:54,915
l said, thats enough.

260
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:57,392
Sit down.

261
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:11,174
Do exercise four, five and six.

262
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:23,382
Very quietly.

263
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:30,192
Dont worry.
The worst is still to come.

264
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,228
Youre still getting
the silent treatment.

265
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,229
Whats the next phase?

266
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:39,165
Well, unless you can work up
a little black magic...

267
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:43,004
...these little bastards have
a multitude of tricks.

268
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,379
Why did you take up teaching?

269
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:52,883
lts good to have some kind of a job.

270
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,121
But lm teaching them nothing.

271
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,117
lm not even getting to first base.

272
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:01,155
Dont worry.

273
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:04,687
Your lot leaves this term.
The next will be better.

274
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:07,330
Theyll be just as bad.
Probably worse.

275
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:09,393
Whats your answer?

276
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,568
What they need...

277
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:13,535
...is a bloody good hiding.

278
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,435
l feel rather sorry for them,
you know?

279
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:22,045
Most of them can hardly read.

280
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:26,449
Youre so naive,
my dear old colleague.

281
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:32,454
Theyll be earning twice as much
as us before you can shake a stick.

282
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:36,788
Theyll happily be part
of the great London unwashed:

283
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:37,825
llliterate...

284
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:42,325
...smelly and quite content.

285
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:46,093
An educations a disadvantage
in this day and age.

286
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:48,936
That is ridiculous!

287
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,506
But still true.

288
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:54,010
So you had better start
brushing up...

289
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:57,045
...on your voodoo if you wish
to remain sane.

290
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,148
Good morning.

291
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,051
All right, take your seats.

292
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:17,763
- All right, Sir?
- L hope you didnt hurt yourself.

293
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:18,799
You all right?

294
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:22,167
Cheap stuff theyre selling nowadays.

295
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:25,704
Want me to help, Sir?

296
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:00,171
Sit down.

297
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:27,505
Take your proper places.

298
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:30,573
We can move around here,
you know, Sir.

299
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:36,875
Take your proper places.

300
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:12,410
Beg pardon.

301
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,256
Something the matter?

302
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,691
Seales, is something wrong?

303
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,938
lts me mum.
Shes awful sick.

304
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,296
lm sorry.

305
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,439
Anything l can do?

306
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,300
Nothing.

307
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:44,876
- Shes English.
- L see.

308
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:48,352
Youre like my old man,
except youre bigger and younger.

309
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:49,679
Rotten bastard!

310
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:51,748
You shouldnt speak like that.

311
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:54,824
You know nothing.
l hate him!

312
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:56,254
Why not?

313
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:59,692
Never forgive him for
what he did to me mum. Never!

314
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:01,529
He married her, didnt he?

315
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:02,722
Didnt he?

316
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:26,114
Today, lets take a look
at South America.

317
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:32,259
lm sorry, Mr. Fackeray.
The bloody things just slipped.

318
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:36,732
The name is Thackeray,
and they are not 创bloody things. 创

319
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:39,426
They were a pile of books.

320
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:41,538
Thats a good netting score.

321
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:46,177
Pam, love, thats not a bloody pile,
but its a pile of books.

322
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:48,674
All right, settle down.

323
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,678
l was only trying to help,
Mr. Thackeray, Sir.

324
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,407
Thats right, Mr. Fackeray.

325
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:57,384
Curley was only trying to put
that little scrubber in her place.

326
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:02,891
l know what Curley was trying to do.
Now just settle down.

327
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:07,662
We are going to study
South America.

328
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:12,727
Now turn to page 37
in your geography book.

329
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:55,871
创They were alone...

330
00:26:56,081 --> 00:27:00,017
...but not alone as they who
shut in chambers think it loneliness.

331
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:03,779
The voiceless sand and the drooping
caves that lay around them...

332
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:06,247
...made them to each other press...

333
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,256
...as if there were no life
beneath the sky... 创

334
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:17,191
Sorry, love.
lts the bleeding desk.

335
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:19,267
Do you speak such words
to your father?

336
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,029
Youre not my bleeding father!

337
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:33,916
All l want to know is,
who does he think he is?

338
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:38,912
Mate, shut up!

339
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:00,660
Morning.

340
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,342
Hello, Thackeray.
How goes it?

341
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:08,376
Fine, thank you, Sir.

342
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:31,199
All you boys, out.

343
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,997
The girls stay where they are.

344
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:35,433
Whats the matter?

345
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:38,669
- Out at once!
- All right.

346
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:52,718
l am sick of your foul language...

347
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:56,325
...your crude behavior
and your sluttish manner.

348
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:58,826
A decent woman keeps
certain things private.

349
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,430
Only a filthy slut
would have done this!

350
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,624
Those who encouraged her
are just as bad!

351
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:06,804
l dont care whos responsible.
Youre all to blame!

352
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:09,473
lm leaving for five minutes,
by which time...

353
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:12,268
...that disgusting object
had better be removed.

354
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,604
And the windows opened
to clear the stench!

355
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:18,715
lf you must play these filthy games,
do them in your homes...

356
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,810
...and not in my classroom.

357
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,132
Whats the matter?

358
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,857
Man, oh, man!

359
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:42,404
l lost my temper. The one thing
l swore l would never do.

360
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:44,507
God, did l lose my temper!

361
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:45,539
What happened?

362
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:48,143
After all the bull
lve taken in my life...

363
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:52,840
...in a few short weeks,
those kids have got me so steamed up.

364
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:56,111
So easy. So quickly.

365
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:58,186
l never would have thought it.

366
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:02,317
- Perhaps youre trying too hard.
- Those kids are devils incarnate.

367
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,826
l tried everything. Everything!
But nothing l tried...

368
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:08,558
Kids.

369
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:11,461
Kids.

370
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:12,829
Thats it!

371
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,733
Those are out.

372
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:46,699
They are useless to you.

373
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,899
l realized you are not children.

374
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:53,339
You will be adults in a few weeks,
with all the responsibilities.

375
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:57,503
From now on, you will be treated
as such by me and by each other...

376
00:31:57,715 --> 00:32:01,276
...as adults.
Responsible adults.

377
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:04,853
Next, well be reasonable
with each other.

378
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:07,616
We are just going to talk,
you and l.

379
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:10,187
You are going to listen
without interruption.

380
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:14,354
And when l am finished,
one of you may have your say.

381
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:16,396
Without interruptions.

382
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:17,659
Next...

383
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:20,800
What a morning!
Everythings gone wrong.

384
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:24,338
First, the alarm didnt go off.
Then l had to wait hours for a bus.

385
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:26,942
l must have stood there
three bleeding hours...

386
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:28,237
Example:

387
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:31,314
There are two ways to enter a room.

388
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:34,110
One is like an adult,
a lady with dignity.

389
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,843
The other is like a brat.

390
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:41,024
Miss Dare has shown us the second way.
Perhaps youd demonstrate the first.

391
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:12,449
lm sorry lm late.

392
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:25,265
Next...

393
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:29,666
...we are all going to observe
certain courtesies in this classroom.

394
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,169
You will call me
Sir or Mr. Thackeray.

395
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:35,141
The young ladies will be
addressed as Miss...

396
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,075
...the boys by their surnames.

397
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:39,909
Why should we call them Miss?
We know them.

398
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:41,483
l beg your pardon?

399
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,151
l said, why should we
call them Miss?

400
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:45,549
We know them.

401
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:47,816
ls there a young lady you feel...

402
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,859
...does not deserve to be
addressed as Miss?

403
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,928
- No, Sir.
- Good.

404
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:03,932
Next, general deportment.

405
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:06,003
First, the young ladies.

406
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:10,370
They must prove worthy of
the courtesies we will show them.

407
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:12,640
Soon, boyfriends and marriage
will concern you.

408
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:15,410
No man likes a slut for long.

409
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:18,282
Only the worst type will marry one.

410
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:23,350
And the competition for men
on the outside is rough.

411
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,885
Next, men.

412
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:30,294
lve seen garbage collectors
who are cleaner.

413
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,138
Toughness is a quality
of the mind...

414
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:37,171
...like bravery,
honesty and ambition.

415
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:40,003
lf you want to wear your hair long,
clean it...

416
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:42,839
...else youll soon get lice and smell.

417
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,978
Soon your principle interest
will be girls.

418
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:50,120
You will be more attractive
with clean clothes, clean shoes...

419
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:52,221
...hands, face, teeth, et cetera.

420
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,390
Any questions?

421
00:34:59,097 --> 00:34:59,927
Miss Pegg.

422
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:02,296
What about Mr. Weston, Sir?

423
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,561
Hes never tidy, his shoes is
never brushed, and his hairs a mess.

424
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:07,738
lts filthy.

425
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:11,665
Mr. Weston is not your teacher.
We wont discuss him.

426
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:16,011
lm the one to criticize
if l fail to maintain the standards.

427
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:17,272
Thats not fair.

428
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:21,307
Sir...

429
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:25,851
...or Mr. Thackeray.
Didnt you understand?

430
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,751
Thats not fair...

431
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,188
...Sir.

432
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:31,884
l agree.

433
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,957
But thats an example of things
youll have to put up with as an adult.

434
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:38,567
Youll just have to take it.

435
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:43,631
Next, we are going to talk
about various...

436
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:48,945
Good morning.

437
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:52,116
- L wanted to see how you were doing.
- Fine, sir.

438
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,180
Good.

439
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:56,345
Thank you.

440
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:13,063
What is it?

441
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:25,638
Palmer.

442
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:28,815
What are we going
to talk about, Sir?

443
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:32,280
About life...

444
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:34,718
...survival...

445
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:36,784
...love...

446
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:39,963
...death, sex, marriage...

447
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:43,292
...rebellion, anything you want.

448
00:36:58,282 --> 00:37:00,682
l never did see one like him, Pam.

449
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:04,412
Even when he blew his stack,
no swearing or nothing.

450
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:05,452
Blimey!

451
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:09,353
Aint natural, thats what.
Does he really mean what he says?

452
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,584
l dont know.

453
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:14,891
ltd be a change, though, to see
those creeps acting like gents.

454
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,035
Here, which one do you fancy?

455
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:19,528
l like Babs.

456
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,830
Yeah? Watch this.

457
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:26,404
- Come on, Pam, love.
- Get lost, Denham!

458
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:29,378
l dont like
your smelly tricks, do l?

459
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,571
And its Miss Dare to you.

460
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:33,781
Get stuffed.

461
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:38,582
Come on then, love.

462
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:44,757
You heard what Sir said,
Mr. Smarty Denham.

463
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:49,789
lf you want to dance with me,
you bleeding well ask proper.

464
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:54,837
May l have the pleasure
of this dance, Miss Pegg?

465
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:56,529
Blimey!
Good old Potts.

466
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:58,140
Get you, Potter.

467
00:37:58,342 --> 00:37:59,172
Shut up!

468
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:02,038
Who does he think he is,
bleeding Fred Astaire?

469
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:04,879
Come on, Miss Pegg.

470
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:14,524
Look at me.
l am a lady, l am.

471
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:39,509
Rotten tarts, all of them.

472
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:41,776
Bleeding chimney sweep
was right about that.

473
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,614
He wont catch me
spending me nicker on them.

474
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,320
He said we could talk about anything.

475
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:52,393
You are so right, Tich, me mate.

476
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:55,190
He did say we could ask him anything.

477
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:57,796
Questions and answers.

478
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:11,976
Last night on the telly,
there was this travelogue picture.

479
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:15,380
You know, a lot of black women
dancing around with no tops.

480
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,648
Dont they ever dress proper?

481
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:20,289
Whats proper varies
throughout the world...

482
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:22,015
...depending on
customs and climate.

483
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:26,493
For their climate and customs,
they were dressed properly.

484
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,255
Are you from South Africa, Sir?

485
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:31,663
Of course not.
South Africans is white, isnt they?

486
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:36,102
A South African is a native
of South Africa, regardless of color.

487
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:37,831
l was born in British Guiana.

488
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:44,246
What did you mean the other day
about rebellion, Sir?

489
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:46,108
Change.

490
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:50,651
Take your hairstyles.
Thats a form of rebellion, isnt it?

491
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:52,152
What, Sir?

492
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:55,382
Dont you do it
to be different from adults?

493
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:57,857
Theyve messed up the world,
havent they?

494
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,656
- You can say that again.
- So you rebel.

495
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:04,193
Even the way you dress is
a form of rebellion, isnt it?

496
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,267
lts just the new fashion, Sir.

497
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:10,167
Of course, the adults look
proper stupid in our gear.

498
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:13,070
Do you think its wrong
to be different, to rebel?

499
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:17,171
lt is your duty to change
the world, if you can.

500
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:18,913
Not by violence.

501
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:22,381
Peacefully, individually,
not as a mob.

502
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:25,850
Take the Beatles.
They started a huge social revolution.

503
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:29,219
The fashions they set in dress...

504
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,394
...and hairstyles are worldwide now.

505
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:35,392
Every new fashion is
a form of rebellion.

506
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:39,368
Theres a fine exhibition
of costumes through the ages...

507
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,936
...on at the Victoria
and Albert Museum.

508
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:43,873
l think you should see it.

509
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:47,271
Also, you should see
the Museum of Natural History.

510
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:49,878
What, us lot to go to a museum?

511
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,240
- Sure.
- Youre joking.

512
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:55,909
Youll discover that
your hairstyles are 200 years old...

513
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,556
...and that your costumes
or your dress...

514
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:01,190
...is right out of 1920.

515
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:04,927
Shut up!
Look, Sir, when can we go?

516
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:08,860
Theres no time after school,
and lve got to look after the kids.

517
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:12,729
l have to do the housework
and get the supper for the lodgers.

518
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:16,532
Me mums expecting a baby any day,
and l got to baby-sit.

519
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,709
Why dont you take us?
We could go in the morning.

520
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:24,005
Who would like that?

521
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:28,640
What a drag!

522
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:31,117
Dont you want a day off?
Put your hand up.

523
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:36,154
- Put both hands up.
- Fat chance!

524
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:38,726
lt wouldnt work.

525
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:42,565
lts not the sort of risk
wed dare to take at North Quay.

526
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:44,233
l would like to try, sir.

527
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:48,565
The best of pupils are inclined
to show off in public.

528
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,270
Your class?

529
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:53,806
Youd never be able
to supervise them.

530
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:58,212
When l took this job,
you said you wouldnt interfere...

531
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:00,713
...as long as l stayed
within your framework.

532
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:05,053
lf you can get another staff member
to go with you...

533
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:07,224
...lll approach the council.

534
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:09,650
l see little hope of approval.

535
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,388
Thank you, sir.

536
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:32,242
Miss Blanchard, l think l can
arrange an outing with my class...

537
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:34,883
...if l can get
another teacher to go along.

538
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:36,985
ld love to.
And its Gillian.

539
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:38,381
When is the outing?

540
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:40,989
When we arrange
travel warrants and permission.

541
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:42,749
Just let me know when.

542
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,190
Thanks, Gillian. Bye.

543
00:42:50,534 --> 00:42:51,592
Good morning.

544
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:56,902
What would you like
to talk about today?

545
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:01,042
Ladies first.

546
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:03,143
Miss Joseph.

547
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:06,145
Marriage, Sir.
You know, boyfriends and things.

548
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:09,319
How do you know hes the right one?
What to look for.

549
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,147
How to avoid divorce.

550
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:12,947
Dont get married.

551
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:16,287
Wheres Miss Purcell?

552
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:20,190
Shes to look after the home today.
Her mum had the baby last night.

553
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:21,591
What hospital?

554
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,996
No hospital, Sir.
The doctor came to her.

555
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:26,032
She all right?

556
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:27,703
She just had a kid.

557
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:34,940
Now, marriage.

558
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:37,713
First, let us lay some ground rules.

559
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:41,248
lve never been married,
so what l say is as an outsider.

560
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,784
Now, what should a girl
look for in a man?

561
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:47,480
l think first we ought
to determine what is marriage.

562
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:49,456
Miss Joseph.

563
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,890
Holy wedlock.

564
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:55,798
Potter, be serious.
Youll get your turn.

565
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,560
Miss Pegg.

566
00:43:57,768 --> 00:43:59,167
lts life, isnt it, Sir?

567
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:02,737
Everyone gets married.
l mean, sometime.

568
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:03,929
Why didnt you marry?

569
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:05,638
No one would have him.

570
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:07,071
l was very poor.

571
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:12,079
And there was something in me
that wanted an education.

572
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:14,477
So l put all of
my energies into that.

573
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:19,483
Well, l got started later.
Just never met the right girl.

574
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,292
What should a girl look for
in a man?

575
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,751
- Miss Clark?
- What work did you do, Sir?

576
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:29,660
l waited tables.
l cooked in a hamburger joint.

577
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:32,267
l washed dishes for a time, cars.

578
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:35,669
For a year l was a janitor
in an apartment block.

579
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:37,807
- All sorts of jobs.
- You washed dishes?

580
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:38,838
l did.

581
00:44:39,043 --> 00:44:40,305
But you talk posh.

582
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:43,878
- That wasnt easy.
- You didnt always talk like that?

583
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:47,983
When l was your age, l used a patois,
a kind of simple English.

584
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:51,710
l buy and bust your booby
if you dont get up off of this place.

585
00:44:51,922 --> 00:44:53,355
l didnt understand a word.

586
00:44:53,557 --> 00:44:56,788
Well, l dont always understand
what you say either.

587
00:44:56,994 --> 00:45:01,090
But the point is, if you work hard,
you can do almost anything.

588
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:03,027
You can get any job you want.

589
00:45:04,802 --> 00:45:08,568
You can even change your speech
if you want to.

590
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:11,436
After l got my degree...

591
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:14,110
...l went to work in South America
for an oil company.

592
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:16,404
The only women in that region...

593
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:20,413
...were jungle lndians who carried
blowpipes and poison darts.

594
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:33,787
You could have broke my hands.

595
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:38,699
We were discussing marriage.

596
00:45:39,603 --> 00:45:43,061
To my mind, marriage is
no way of life for the weak...

597
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:44,501
...the selfish...

598
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:46,236
...or the insecure.

599
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:50,570
Whats the matter, Weston?

600
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:53,079
These damn fool Americans!

601
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:55,615
They bog up everything
theyre connected with.

602
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:57,218
What a shower!

603
00:45:58,021 --> 00:46:01,923
lll never forgive the President for
not coming to Churchills funeral...

604
00:46:02,126 --> 00:46:04,993
...nor sending the vice president.
Rotten bad manners.

605
00:46:05,195 --> 00:46:07,663
- Lt was very naughty.
- L quite agree.

606
00:46:07,865 --> 00:46:11,631
A typically stupid, appalling
and unnecessary mistake.

607
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:14,431
- What can you expect?
- Still beefing?

608
00:46:14,638 --> 00:46:17,334
Give them a chance.
Theyve not been in the business...

609
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:19,634
...of leading the world
as long as Britain was.

610
00:46:19,843 --> 00:46:22,573
You continue to astonish me,
old chum.

611
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:25,682
l should thought
if anyone took a point of...

612
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:27,111
Now what?

613
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:31,381
Miss Pegg wants to know
if the netballs fixed.

614
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:32,953
Miss who?

615
00:46:33,157 --> 00:46:35,057
Barbara Pegg.
Miss Pegg, Sir.

616
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:36,851
Here you are, Fernman.

617
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:38,419
Thank you, Sir.

618
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:41,857
Whats going on in
this classroom of yours?

619
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:46,024
Suburban formality? Lts a bit
foreign in this neck of the woods.

620
00:46:46,236 --> 00:46:49,535
Some sort of experiment
in culture for the masses?

621
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,300
lts an elementary
experiment in courtesy.

622
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:55,672
And do we ignorant critters
have to follow suit?

623
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:59,242
- Please yourself.
- Thank goodness for that!

624
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:02,418
Do you object to being
taught manners by one of the boys?

625
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:04,917
l dont expect to be taught
by those morons.

626
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:08,091
So long as we learn,
it doesnt matter who teaches us.

627
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:10,226
Good afternoon, everybody.

628
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:15,493
Now were talking.

629
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:21,036
Nothing like payday.

630
00:47:21,238 --> 00:47:25,072
By the way, your museum visit
has been approved.

631
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:27,470
lf anything goes wrong,
the school suffers.

632
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,441
Nothing will go wrong, sir.

633
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:15,389
For a moment, l thought
l was in the wrong classroom.

634
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:17,621
Wheres Jackson?

635
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:19,059
We dont know.

636
00:48:19,263 --> 00:48:22,994
Tich wouldnt miss this
unless he was sick or something.

637
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,963
Well give him a few minutes.

638
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:40,839
lts me, Jackson.

639
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:43,685
l have to take the bag-wash for mum.
Can you wait?

640
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:46,355
Sure.
How long will it take?

641
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:47,989
Half a mo.
Just up the frog.

642
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:49,055
God love you.

643
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:52,527
Hang on, Tich.
lll give you a hand.

644
00:49:05,842 --> 00:49:07,400
All right.

645
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,374
Back on the sidewalk.

646
00:49:14,184 --> 00:49:16,584
Whats a frog got to do with it?

647
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:19,287
lts a rhyming slang.
Old-fashioned cockney.

648
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:21,548
lts not used anymore.
Just for old people.

649
00:49:21,758 --> 00:49:23,225
lts a drag, Sir.

650
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:25,292
Frog means road.
Frog and toad, road.

651
00:49:25,495 --> 00:49:26,553
Trouble, strife, wife.

652
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:28,754
Weeping willow, pillow.
Use the first word.

653
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:31,332
Like the old currant bun,
thats the sun.

654
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:33,969
- Apples and pears, stairs.
- Happy kill, skill.

655
00:49:37,174 --> 00:49:38,539
Ginger beer, queer.

656
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:41,668
All aboard.

657
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:52,400
l think he fancies her.

658
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:54,099
l know you do.

659
00:51:54,311 --> 00:51:55,869
Pamela Dare has a crush on you.

660
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:57,979
Women say the damnedest things.

661
00:51:58,181 --> 00:51:59,842
l think hes nice.

662
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:01,712
So do l.

663
00:52:01,918 --> 00:52:03,078
Youve noticed.

664
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:05,277
l dont treat her different
from the others.

665
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:07,721
l hope we can go out again,
dont you?

666
00:52:07,924 --> 00:52:08,754
l hope so.

667
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:11,450
l hope we can go with him,
because hes nice.

668
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:13,219
Dont make any mistake
about Pamela.

669
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:16,160
Shes a woman
in every sense of the word.

670
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:18,098
l mean...

671
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:20,064
...not that l blame her.

672
00:52:21,905 --> 00:52:23,998
Bleeding rotten taste hes got.

673
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:47,525
Good night, Sir.

674
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:51,899
- See you tomorrow.

675
00:53:04,414 --> 00:53:06,177
Perhaps youd like me
to tidy your desk.

676
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:09,181
- Thats all right.
- Lts no trouble.

677
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:12,878
You ought to get a flat nearby.
Brentwoods much too far away.

678
00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:15,523
- Theres nice ones around.
- Lve thought of that.

679
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:19,058

682
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:28,927
Dont worry about your desk.

683
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:31,835
Thanks, but that wont be necessary.

684
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:33,634
Thats perfectly all right.

685
00:53:33,843 --> 00:53:35,834
A womans work is never done.

686
00:53:36,746 --> 00:53:37,838
Good night, Sir.

687
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:55,895
Hi, fellas. How are you?

688
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,705
Good morning, Sir.

689
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:06,805
Mr. Florian has given us
permission for more outings.

690
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:09,978
ld like to hear suggestions
of what we might do.

691
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:12,011
- The pictures.
- Wembley, Sir.

692
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:13,610
Cup Final Day.

693
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:14,875
Chamber of Horrors.

694
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,052
What about the Cavern?

695
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:18,620
You know, Liverpool.
The Beatles.

696
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:20,719
Hows it going?

697
00:54:21,124 --> 00:54:22,682
Fine, thank you.

698
00:54:22,892 --> 00:54:24,917
Dont worry.
Hell come with me on my day.

699
00:54:25,128 --> 00:54:26,686
Youre under
a supervision order too?

700
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:28,386
Around here, thats nothing.

701
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:30,429
Most of us have been
in front of the law.

702
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:35,037
Breaking windows, playing truant,
raising hell and cussing the coppers.

703
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:41,868
Youve cut yourself.

704
00:54:42,078 --> 00:54:45,047
Youd better put something on that.
You might get lockjaw.

705
00:54:46,047 --> 00:54:56,047
