47
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:05,292


48
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:08,491
Oh my god, I wish I was the same.

49
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:11,303
My mother took Bethie to the movies.

57
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:40,456
No where.

I do not need much
real life hero.

59
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,500
I'm honest.

60
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:53,309
Honored to meet you.
I used to be in the military.

61
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:56,506
Ừ. It must be.
Maybe for a long time.

62
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,518
Laughing time.

63
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,519

Tan finish it.

65
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,324
No, just leave me.

66
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:19,268
Mike, hey,
2 glasses more.

67
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:28,370
Before my mother worked
very hard

68
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:31,476
Martin,
wait had to have a cigarette,

69
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,345
Martin, a 10 year old baby
also needs money  Ừ then we also save money  I do not know anymore,
we really are not okay either  but quite stable.

70
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:39,286
My god, my mother does that

71
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:41,484


72
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,329


73
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,228


74
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:50,366
Maybe worse than you think  I have to pick her up.

75
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,261
You know, you can call me
if you want, you listen very well.

76
00:07:55,441 --> 00:08:00,378
You will have to listen to
a chubby bird said.

77
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,441
- I like that.
- Oh, me too.

78
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:05,511
I want you to know that...
- You refuse me like that?

79
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:10,320
- No, I'm kidding.
- No, I... I...

80
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:14,290


81
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,362
What are you talking about?

82
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:25,268
- I understand each other.
- Maybe.

83
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,465
John Dromoor.

84
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,213
We can be friends.

85
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:01,373
What's up?

86
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:13,249
- Hi, Teena.
- Hi.

87
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,517
Great. Do you have a barbecue?

88
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,328
Bethie, I will miss the fireworks.

89
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,497
- Do not let your mother see.
- It is OK.

90
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,468
Maybe you do not know,
I like this one.

91
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:38,402
Devil child.

92
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,213
You look!

93
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,488
Great!

94
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,297
I like the rainbow color.

95
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:04,333
- Really?
- Alright.

96
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:07,372
she drink.

97
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,450
Your mother looks cheerful.

98
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,256
I do not know. Maybe it true.

99
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:27,415
You know, I like it too.

100
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:37,395
Bethie down here soon!
Are you crazy?

101
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:41,500
- Right now!
- Mom, I can not fall down!

102
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,277
Mom says it is now!
Casey, Casey to worry. Right!

103
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:48,345
= God.
Are you still 5 years old?

104
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:11,469
Hey, eat a little,
mom for this baby.

105
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,409
okay
The ice will flow.

106
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:30,479
Sorry for being screaming.

107
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,279
Bethie baby, it's time to sleep.

108
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,282
- Why did not you and your mother stay?
- Let's go.

109
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,410
Your ipad has this Spongebob,
Bethie has not seen the movie yet.

110
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:05,347
I guess you
_ do not want to come back right?

111
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,417
- Stay away mother.
- See, there are volunteers.

112
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:11,325
B, 8 o'clock in the morning with breakfast.

113
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:14,228
Are you sure? They are playing the song we like.

114
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:15,492
- Again?
- Let me take you home.

115
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:18,394
Let us go home on our own.
I should not drive when I'm drunk.

116
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,495
Well, five minutes
I welcome you two mothers right now.

117
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:24,367
This is beautiful night.
Try to stay awake.

118
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,245
See you tomorrow morning.

119
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:31,340
How do you feel?

120
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:38,251
Oh my baby toy.

121
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,517
- I forgot.
- Ồ stop it

122
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:46,329
Why is my mother so heavy? Here it is.

123
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,424
I'm really happy,
mom is fine.

124
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:56,305
You know when I was little,
daddy often take me to walk here.

125
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,240
I always carry dolls.
You have to bear it.

126
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:01,505
I hate dolls.

127
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,315
Hey.

128
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,453
= Love you

129
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,289
Wait.

130
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,393
Bethie, I do not like mom talking about Daddy?

131
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,423
Actually, I do not like Mom watching me  like baby is newborn

132
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:23,292


133
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:26,266
At that time I did not go anywhere  - Child.
- Mom, stop it.

134
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:30,432
I do not remember anything.

135
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:37,439
son.

136
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:40,511
I do not remember him
look like anymore.

137
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,253
His face,

138
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:49,327
whether children try,

139
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:53,396
very trying

140
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,425
but it just fades away.

141
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:59,299
As if I have never been there.

142
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,269
that's fine

143
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,368


144
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:14,352
Every time I miss you  abruptly

145
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:16,444
he is right here

146
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,450
I am not angry with you.

147
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,490
If you do not remember,
_ is not my fault either  I miss my father too.

148
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,334
I can not remember my father
so it's okay.

149
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,430
Are you sure?

150
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,377
You know,
my know a shortcut.

151
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:46,442
It will take us home.

152
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:56,427


153
00:14:57,263 --> 00:15:00,528


154
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:06,403
- Mom?
- Lie?

155
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:11,272
- That face looks scared.
- It is OK. He had been there since high school.

156
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,503
In the dark.

157
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:23,515
- Mom?
- Lie?

158
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:27,257
- Where are we?
- Do not you remember?

159
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:32,430
- No.
- My mom and dad came out to go for a canoe  - off Niagara Falls.
- Really?

160
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:36,228
- Ừ.
- Is it still possible?

161
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:39,394


162
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:41,472
- Mom is not sure.
Let me call him tomorrow.

163
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,300
- Hope he is free.
- MOUND.

164
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:47,269
Be careful.

165
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:00,325
This place is beautiful.

166
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,352
Look, there is a fish.

167
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,254
Ừ. People say this place
_ is fisherman land.

168
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,457
I do not know.

169
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:13,362
Once upon a time there was a mermaid living by the lake  She is very beautiful and her hair is very yellow.

170
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:18,340


171
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:22,277
Teena Maguire.

172
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:25,406
Do you remember me?
Sure to remember.

173
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,252
Do you miss Teena Maguire?

174
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:31,515
Come here.

175
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,485
Do you have anything to say?

176
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:36,318
Well you guys. Leave us alone.

177
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:38,396
Where are you two?
Where do you want to go?

178
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,295
Do you drink beer?

179
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,400
Oh, that's your baby?

180
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,469
I remember.
I have a girlfriend

181
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,329
I do not want to make her angry.

182
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:50,306
What do you think?

183
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:53,378
Drilling has, do not go.

184
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:57,473
Bethie!

185
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:11,319
= Mommy!

186
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:43,353
Let my mother go!

187
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:53,362
Do not hurt your mother!

188
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:01,295
= Mommy!

189
00:20:01,295 --> 00:20:59,290
f c i n e. N e t

190
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:46,235
What is DNA, then fingerprints,
just missing the name again.

191
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:06,323
The uncle will help his mother.

192
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:37,380
Too much blood.
Get into emergency immediately!

193
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:42,426
Miss, do not!
You have to lie down!

194
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:45,320
She must lie down.
Stay calm!

195
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:50,299
= Mommy!

196
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:55,236
- Mummy!
- Sorry, family members must be outside!

197
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:15,487
that's fine It is OK.

198
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:20,388
Now you're fine.
Let me take the blanket for you.

199
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:32,503
- The doctor will be down soon.
- No, I do not wait for a doctor.

200
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:38,282
Do not have "grandma" with me.
I want to meet my children and grandchildren.

201
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:42,319
Damn it.

202
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:51,259
Oh my god.
Oh, grandchild, her angel.

203
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:54,465
Are you okay?

204
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:57,332
- I'm fine.
- Really?

205
00:23:57,502 --> 00:24:00,335
Promise me.

206
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:05,469
Where is your mother?

207
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:10,405
My mother is fine. Since we are together,
she will...

208
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:13,410
Madam, I'm Inspector John Dromoor.

209
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:16,447
I go with my grandson.

210
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:20,383
- Yes, that's right. She looked very clearly at those names.
- It's 12 years old.

211
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:23,460
Her mother can not speak.
She is the only witness.

212
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,287
I do not mind. It is OK.

213
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:29,300
Are you upset about?

214
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:34,463
I need your help.

215
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,472
Police here.
Facing the wall.

216
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:46,213
Do not move.
Stay away.

217
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:51,284
Down now.

218
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,451
Down now.

219
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:58,328
Avoid.

220
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:02,263
Stay there.

221
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:05,369
What did I do?

222
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,448
stand back.

223
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:29,521
Please stand back.

224
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:32,488
Where are you going?
Stop.

225
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:36,357
Do not chase.
- Stop.

226
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:39,403
stand back.

227
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:03,427
1 person and 7 people.
We are on this side. They are on the other side

228
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:08,460
There is nothing to be afraid of.

229
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:15,364
Bethie, I pointed out him,
_and she would take him away for a long time.

230
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:22,371
He wears a three-hole shirt.
And people next to him.

231
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,311
Second?

232
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:31,478
The person wearing blue pants.
Three.

233
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:38,319
years. And fly.

234
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:46,337
It is him.

235
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:50,435
No. 2 3 5 7 please
step forward.

236
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:58,407
Marvin and Lloyd Fick.

237
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:02,281
do we do it again

238
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:16,457
The Niagara Falls police are investigating  A raid on a local woman
and her 12-year-old daughter  last night

239
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:20,294
After leaving the party, the woman was sexually assaulted  There are sources that,
may daughter also be attacked.

240
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:22,269
Bethie. Oh my God.

241
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:26,343
- I'm sorry.
- No problem

242
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:31,279
Mom will be fine.

243
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,359


244
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,421


245
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:46,389


246
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:51,264
Mother was beaten in the head,
so she was not awake yet.

247
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,496
Thank you for bringing flowers lyly.

248
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:58,274
My mom loves it.

249
00:27:58,476 --> 00:28:02,276
Madam, just heard the news came right away.

250
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:05,406
Why? What are you doing here?

251
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:09,320
Look, my mother is ripe.

252
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:12,456
Did you forget the bag in the car?
I'm back right now.

253
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:18,258
À lady parked in...

254
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:23,325
I'm sorry.

255
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:45,322
Teena Maguire, new patient.

256
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,391
Are you a family member?

257
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:51,262
Sir, are you a family member?

258
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:46,441
Most notable is Daffy Duck.

259
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:53,354
I will call my father later.

260
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:56,517
Ồ father needs children
less look like prostitutes.

261
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:59,419
You dress like that where to go?

262
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:08,396
They will not do that, Father.
They are very good.

263
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,239
They do not.

264
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:17,470
God will help
people who really love him.

265
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:22,514
We do well,
he will keep his word.

266
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:26,517
As a good parent of God,
what is your job?

267
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:31,222
All of us are your children,  but from now until he calls us
, we live in this world.

268
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:35,230


269
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:42,269
Sometimes, he sent down an angel.
Sometimes, he sent down a messenger.

270
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:47,504
Her job is to find the best criminal defense lawyer.

271
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,507
Then who will pay here?
God?

272
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,250
- Yeah, that's right.
- Must overcome the challenge.

273
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:02,453
Jay Kirkpatrick.
Ừ, he is not very good.

274
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:07,321
But he is the one you need.
He defended 18 cases for the Vatican.

275
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:12,395
But in this world,
the truth is not true anymore.

276
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:16,338
Actually,
it is just the rest.

277
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:21,474
Both rape and assault.

278
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,348
Sometimes it's just
business.

279
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:27,245
Jay Kirkpatrick.

280
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:33,413
Sorry.
My mother is awake

281
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:56,473
= Mommy.
Mommy.

282
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,516
Mother still like that.

283
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:09,317
Hey baby.
Hello Baby.

284
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:14,297
It's Bethie and mom.
Mother and I are here.

285
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:22,271
- What happened?
- It's alright then mom.

286
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:25,237
Roof...

287
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:29,277
mother told her
down.

288
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:33,416
Oh, no, I do not remember.

289
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:40,322
I do not mind.
Mum wakes up.

290
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,420
They have been the cause.

291
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:49,300
Maguire baby?
She will complain a lot.

292
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:51,493
They say they have proof.
Blood and DNA.

293
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:54,271
Television speak only.

294
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:58,238
In the jury trial,
will have two stories.

295
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:01,402
The jury will choose the
story that they like better.

296
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:08,218
The story and how grandparents tell it
is important.

297
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:11,254
So how much does your story cost?

298
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:15,390
I like that.
Straight to the point.

299
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:18,387
850 per hour. 1250 per hour trial.

300
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:23,233
$ 15,000 to keep jail
for each of you.

301
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:25,302
We can not pay.

302
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:28,462
Pay no attention okay.
And we will pay.

303
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:35,402
Our house.

304
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:39,210
I worked for 30 years
to pay enough to buy a home.

305
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,409
We only have that.

306
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,412
Do you have to pay double?

307
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:48,382
Two defendants.

308
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:52,285
But they are all prosecuted
the same crime. Tell a story.

309
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:56,399
= God, Walt!

310
00:33:57,402 --> 00:34:01,429
As a woman has two children, she also does
so much for both. So she has two ti.

311
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:04,304
- Can you believe it?
- No problem.

312
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:08,369
Walt, you make fun
_.

313
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:16,309
I mean, can you discount
a bit for us?

314
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:22,315
I understand the situation
your dilemma, Walt

315
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,428
Really, I am also a father.

316
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:28,488
And sometimes, we have to make difficult decisions  But we all want to do the right thing for our children, right?

317
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,436


318
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:36,433
We will do all we can to help.

319
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:39,300
Then take a little
also what?

320
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:42,377
Believe me, I'm doing
what should I do.

321
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:49,513
Walt, listen to me say this. I'm paying
for your child not to go to jail.

322
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:54,415
so they do not rape
like that innocent woman.

323
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:05,402
Helen

324
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:08,505
cancel your appointment
and let them solve it.

325
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:14,438
See who's going to be fine.

326
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,346
Police have visited,

327
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,253
to ask about

328
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,352
my daughter leads Bethie home.

329
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:37,460
They want to know if you can
look at the pictures to see if you can remember...

330
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:40,404
I can not.

331
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:45,432
Really.
I do not remember anything.

332
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:50,244
that's fine
It is OK.

333
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:53,475
Doctors say gradually you will
miss out. There is nothing to worry about.

334
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:58,377
This is sent to
when mom is sleeping.

335
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:01,219
I was open before,
but stalking was not good.

336
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:03,485
No one likes a lot of things.

337
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:09,460
She does not like flowers.

338
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:13,293
She just does not like the
cut flowers. That's it.

339
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:16,306
Really?

340
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:44,325
Mother. Not my mother's house.

341
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:47,302
Mother does not want to hear.

342
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:51,503
It's okay, mother.
I never go to live.

343
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:58,279
Just the room when I need help.

344
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:01,350
Only when she is better

345
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:05,481
She is like that time machine.

346
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:10,385
She kept everything the same.
She still treats me as 16 years old.

347
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:20,532
Then it will be fine.

348
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,399
Thank you.

349
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:30,471
Why do not you eat ice cream?

350
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,442
Maybe because I'm not hungry.

351
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:38,346
Even blueberries?

352
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:40,422
Really?

353
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:44,485
rub rub rub.
Your granddaughter is sick.

354
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:04,347
I'm fine. Listen to her.

355
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:12,415
The animals are connected to us,
they come near us.

356
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:15,292
They know you hurt.

357
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:18,453
That's good.

358
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:27,532
Save me!

359
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:11,312
Do not come near me!

360
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:18,319
It's okay! It is OK!

361
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,421
Why do they do that?

362
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,464
Child. I do not know.
I'm sorry

363
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:39,402
I'm sorry

364
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,355
I do not like him. So...

365
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:58,519
So do not talk.
Ignore him. See you learn this.

366
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:16,279
Are you lying about my brother?

367
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:19,347
You watch for karmic retribution.

368
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:23,510
You and your mother's whore
should go away. You hear?

369
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:47,375
This is a procedure to prepare the hearing.

370
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:50,507
What you have to do is identify them.

371
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:55,216
She just looked at me
and did not look at anyone else.

372
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:57,286
Until she asked me "Who?"

373
00:40:57,388 --> 00:41:01,222
Is not "Who?" , Which is "If".
If you see them.

374
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:04,486
First, we will ask you
how do you know them to make up...

375
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:06,523
She does not know them.
They know her from the beginning.

376
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:08,423
Mother, mother do not come in.

377
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:11,427
- Miss Maguire did not know them?
- Stand up.

378
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:15,500
She is right. She does not know them.

379
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:19,470
And I will say it well in court.
I promise.

380
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,245
I hope so.

381
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:24,346
Hey,

382
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:30,444
look at me, okay?

383
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:35,382
= Maguire, you see these people
in court today?

384
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:39,361
Yes. I see them.

385
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:42,289
Good.

386
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:47,466
What do you think?
I think they look pretty secretive.

387
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,400
Mother, let me help you.

388
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:00,441
- Maybe I should go along.
- No. No, she is very moving.

389
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:04,510
Ladies and gentlemen, I think this time
just listen to the two sides talk.

390
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:08,223
At trial, we will need you to follow.

391
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,384
This is related to my child.
My child is not...

392
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:13,429
We do not need you in this session.

393
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,296
I found a beautiful thing
here.

394
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:22,462
Great.
So be prepared.

395
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:26,266
= Mommy. Are we ready

396
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:29,243
I do very well.

397
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:35,284
We are ready.

398
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:42,486
I am a wonderful girl
_ mother.

399
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:45,485
Are you hungry?

400
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:51,298
I cook my soup for you.
Soup tomatoes with finished smoked meat that mom likes.

401
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:55,529
Let her warm up.

402
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,342
I'm back right now.

403
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:04,380
Teena.

404
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:12,319
Friday morning is the first step
in a series of things  to such guys
can not harm anyone anymore.

405
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:15,357
Hey.

406
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:23,357
See you in court.

407
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:27,302
She pointed out them.
I will take pictures immediately.

408
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:09,502
Teena.

409
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:20,356
- Whore.
- What do you say?

410
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,459
- Shh remember.
- Please sit.

411
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:24,419


412
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:34,371
Please keep quiet.

413
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:40,243
All stood up.

414
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:48,383
It seems we
missing a lawyer.

415
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:51,311
Invite all sit down.

416
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:03,229
Jay Kirkpatrick, the accused attorney's Court.

417
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:08,327
I sincerely apologize.
I am in a state meeting.

418
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:12,373
I understand.
Welcome to the lawyer.

419
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:14,477
Good morning.

420
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:18,406
Okay.
What do we do this morning?

421
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:23,479
Dear court, on July 4
Teena Maguire is attacked In truth, she was raped collectively near the house
and her daughter was attacked.

422
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:29,281
Evidence shows that the attackers
watched her mother for 10 minutes before.

423
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:35,262
This devastating attack was intended to kill Maguire

424
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:41,267


425
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:45,341
because she was thrown in the boat house
to bleed to death.

426
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:49,439
The truth is, if her daughter Maguire
is not present there  Miss Maguire will not be alive
to date for testimony  Maguire suffered a lot of physical injury  She has been resuscitated
and is trying to cooperate on the attack.

427
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:54,341


428
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:59,287


429
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:04,451


430
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:10,265
Dear Court, Teena Maguire
present here is a miracle Dear Court,
I do not know

431
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:17,332
what is the purpose of the day,
but if they want to act in court  Are we ready?

432
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:20,239
Okay. Then let me say
my preface.

433
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:22,439


434
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:30,252


435
00:46:32,256 --> 00:46:36,249
- Call the first witness away.
- We call Inspector John Dromoor.

436
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:48,369
And on the night of July 4, the inspector
answered a phone call  What is its content?

437
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:51,440
Dear Sir,

438
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:54,300
we have a problem here,
because this is a new discovery.

439
00:46:54,444 --> 00:47:00,474
We have no call history.

440
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:03,514
One minute, Your Honor.

441
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:05,321


442
00:47:05,422 --> 00:47:09,222
I and my colleagues are answering
another call when we see

443
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:13,262
He inspector here
is my colleague.

444
00:47:13,397 --> 00:47:16,264
There should be no questions here.

445
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:19,300
I want to repeat, sir.
Thanks God.

446
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:24,363
Inspector, July 4 night,
when he and his colleagues go home  What did you see?

447
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:26,237


448
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:29,368
A little girl ran up to us
from the boat house.

449
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:33,313
- This girl, Bethie Maguire?
- Right.

450
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:38,286
And when you got into the boat house,
what did you see?

451
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:52,366
Inspector, you are allowed to return.

452
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:54,403
We call Teena Maguire.

453
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:07,511
Sorry Maguire.

454
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:12,412
Can you open the sunglasses,
here is not very bright.

455
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:15,491
Dear court, because
injury after the attack

456
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,329
She is extremely sensitive to light.

457
00:48:19,463 --> 00:48:24,332
Looking distracted.
Can she squint her eyes?

458
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:31,441
Thank you, Maguire.

459
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:51,294
- Miss Maguire?
- Yes?

460
00:48:53,497 --> 00:48:57,433
Before the attack, did you know
the attackers?

461
00:48:58,302 --> 00:49:01,362
They know my name.

462
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:07,343
- Oppose.
- Agree.

463
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,506
Ladies and Gentlemen,

464
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:17,514
the defendant is very pleased
not ask her Maguire

465
00:49:18,522 --> 00:49:21,320
Thank you, Maguire.
You are allowed to go.

466
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:24,291
Ladies and gentlemen,
- No. Not. They are here

467
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:27,454
- They are here. I see them.
- I'm sorry, ma'am, but...

468
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:30,391
I see them here.

469
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:33,429
- That's okay, anyway.
- They are right there.

470
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:35,420
f c i n e. N e t

471
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:06,402
She calm down.

472
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:11,507
The evidence has a lot.

473
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:15,368
This action should be ranked
rape,
intentional assault,
and intentional injury.

474
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:18,379
Dear Court, my client  admitted to having sex with Maguire
in that boat house  but that's not rape.

475
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:22,285
Which is the consensus.

476
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:27,381


477
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:31,325


478
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:33,429


479
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:38,263
As evidence has shown

480
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:44,373
Maguire had been drinking before,
in Ramon Casey's party.

481
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:48,342
her nearest boyfriend.

482
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:50,437
quietly

483
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:55,513
A party where 19 people
drink 5 barrels of beer.

484
00:50:58,288 --> 00:51:02,315
Judge, each barrel of beer is about
400 liters of beer  Five barrels of beer, 19 people,
I was stunned too.

485
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:05,360
And certainly, that time was
midnight

486
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:09,330


487
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:12,333
after she quarreled with her boyfriend,  Maguire dragged her away  into the forest  We are going home!

488
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:15,438
Little girl! Have to restrain!

489
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:17,501
Maguire took her home,
led her into the forest  and meet the defendant.

490
00:51:18,341 --> 00:51:20,241
The person she knows,

491
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:23,504
and she asked them to take the money  change sex.

492
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:26,372
quietly

493
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:29,280


494
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:31,387


495
00:51:32,322 --> 00:51:35,257


496
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:37,485


497
00:51:38,528 --> 00:51:41,429


498
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:44,324
And then the defendant left.

499
00:51:44,468 --> 00:51:48,427
Maguire suddenly decided to raise the price  and during her drunken
attacked the accused  - My client is self-protective only.

500
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:53,368
- Then they leave.
- Oppose, sir.

501
00:51:55,245 --> 00:51:58,237
- No effect.
- My client and you are drunk, they admit it

502
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:01,248


503
00:52:01,384 --> 00:52:05,411


504
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:10,449
But they are not, not

505
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:14,422
know of the presence of a 12-year-old girl  he obviously injured himself
while in the forest

506
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:19,361
And right in the testimony of the girl
also admitted as

507
00:52:20,403 --> 00:52:25,397
She does not see
rape scene either  or any other offense.
She was just scared and confused.

508
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:30,336


509
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:35,508


510
00:52:36,353 --> 00:52:39,447
Her mother is irresponsible
because she brought her

511
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:44,358
to the dinner
the evening of July 4

512
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:47,492
- My client is a victim.
- Oppose, Judge.

513
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:51,357
Ladies and gentlemen, the girl was unconscious at that time.
- Void.

514
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:57,468
It is true that she is a victim,
but a victim of motherlessness

515
00:52:58,408 --> 00:53:03,243
The girl was very confused about the time when the alleged rape was committed Maybe she herself cheated on her children  Statue of little girl and mother  purely forged
and cheated.

516
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:06,315
As evidence of
and my client's statements show

517
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:09,316
They do not rape anyone.

518
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:12,353
They are completely innocent

519
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:16,520


520
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:20,262


521
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:25,459


522
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:34,332
No, no,
no, no.

523
00:53:53,296 --> 00:53:58,290
No, no.

524
00:53:58,468 --> 00:54:02,302
Why can you do that?

525
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:06,373
- No, they can not do that.
- Someone call medical.

526
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:36,371
Not bad, huh?

527
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:16,377
my mom will be fine

528
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:19,482
Let your mother sleep. Give her time to go.

529
00:55:26,456 --> 00:55:30,483
- Do not you, let me take a break.
- I just stand here.

530
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:43,267
Two grandchildren should also take a vacation.

531
00:55:43,373 --> 00:55:46,308
- Just let her sleep.
- Thank you.

532
00:55:55,251 --> 00:55:57,481
- What is she like?
- What do you think?

533
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:03,253
Go away.
Come back now!

534
00:56:03,393 --> 00:56:09,332
- Ma'am...
- You promised to protect them.

535
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,367
- She promised to bring justice.
- And I will do it.

536
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:19,499
My daughter is not the same anymore.

537
00:56:23,246 --> 00:56:25,441
Getting him to court again, he will die,
_ that is not the case.

538
00:56:26,349 --> 00:56:30,445
Kirkpatrick's strategy is to try to juggle the jury.

539
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:34,450
- Seems successful.
- The jury wants to find the offender.

540
00:56:35,258 --> 00:56:39,251
- Normally they are all.
- I must be happy.

541
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:42,490
I'm ready.
Ready for him.

542
00:56:43,299 --> 00:56:44,493
This woman is attacked,

543
00:56:45,335 --> 00:56:49,431
The rape will be punished.
I do not let them escape. I need to see Teena.

544
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:52,341
I need you to go now.

545
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,480
Get me a beer.

546
00:58:32,242 --> 00:58:33,300
I'm sorry

547
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:45,378
Drive as if
your child lives here.

548
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:27,487
She has a child.

549
00:59:30,433 --> 00:59:32,401
A daughter.

550
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:37,396
We all know the feeling
the loss of loved ones.

551
00:59:39,442 --> 00:59:42,309
Do not let her lose her mother.

552
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,441
Do not let her suffer more.

553
00:59:47,483 --> 00:59:49,508
What do you care?

554
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:54,313
Just because you find me?

555
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:59,361
Or did you ever see me
in the pub?

556
01:00:02,498 --> 01:00:05,331
I do not understand.

557
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:08,464
They killed me.

558
01:00:09,472 --> 01:00:11,497
Just not up to date
Complete this.

559
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:19,407
I will move slowly.

560
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:45,399
- Thank you.
- Greetings mommy.

561
01:00:46,242 --> 01:00:50,303
- It's good to see her better.
- I will say my mother. Thank you. Bye, Annie.

562
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,240
Lily the cat.

563
01:02:08,324 --> 01:02:11,293
- Mother, why do not you sleep?
- She needs to be transported?

564
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:13,486
Betty, look at this uncle.

565
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:17,493
My mother is going through hard times.
I have to keep an eye on my mother  I must take good care of my mother.

566
01:02:18,334 --> 01:02:20,393
Mother does not want anyone to take care of her mother.

567
01:02:20,536 --> 01:02:23,334
Give this to your mother.
She wants to call any time.

568
01:02:26,309 --> 01:02:30,245
7-0-6-3-5-8

569
01:02:42,492 --> 01:02:48,397
Leave us alone!

570
01:03:27,236 --> 01:03:29,261
They come here.

571
01:04:13,282 --> 01:04:15,250
Please help us.

572
01:04:16,385 --> 01:04:19,252
Beth.

573
01:04:58,261 --> 01:04:59,421
Popcorn.

574
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,339


575
01:05:19,482 --> 01:05:22,417
Well, wait until
after dinner.

576
01:05:23,286 --> 01:05:25,254
I like this one.

577
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:36,255
Looks worried.

578
01:05:53,382 --> 01:05:55,407
Oh come on!

579
01:05:56,352 --> 01:05:59,480
That's right!
Please take her blood!

580
01:06:03,326 --> 01:06:07,422
The $ 20 fish loses in six seconds  fish not? 20 degree?

581
01:06:08,331 --> 01:06:10,458
Do not you have $ 20?

582
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:14,428
- Are you the only one?
- That's OK.

583
01:06:17,506 --> 01:06:21,237
Lost! Go!
Come on! Blow the whistle!

584
01:06:22,345 --> 01:06:26,406


585
01:06:29,251 --> 01:06:31,515
Are you ready to lose?
The battle is over.

586
01:06:42,398 --> 01:06:44,366
Damn it.

587
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:50,363
Hey there.

588
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:04,309
- Calm, Jimmy.
- No problem.

589
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,385
that's fine

590
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:18,423
Let's go fast, because I'll rape you
like rape Teena.

591
01:07:23,339 --> 01:07:26,331
What?
Are not you afraid?

592
01:07:28,277 --> 01:07:31,337
You do what you do, go see, Jimmy.

593
01:07:35,317 --> 01:07:38,252
Do you want to go to court again?

594
01:08:05,281 --> 01:08:08,216
- Do you need anything more?
- Another glass.

595
01:08:54,263 --> 01:08:55,355
- Brand new is called hard hit.
- Jimmy.

596
01:08:56,532 --> 01:08:58,397
dog inspection.

597
01:09:07,409 --> 01:09:10,469
Police here.
Back.

598
01:09:16,318 --> 01:09:20,277
Inspector Dromoor.
Need ambulance and rapid response team.

599
01:09:20,456 --> 01:09:22,390
111-4.

600
01:09:22,525 --> 01:09:26,393
At the shooting, he did not know
who the victim is?

601
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:28,486
Yes sir.
I do not know anything

602
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:31,492
Last month,
did you meet him on court?

603
01:09:32,468 --> 01:09:37,303
- It was dark at night. Did not see anything.
- Before that, in the pub?

604
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:40,373
- when he watched the match?
- I have to go to the bar.

605
01:09:41,343 --> 01:09:45,473
- I sit at the table.
- Sergeant, his weapons fit the weapon to kill him.

606
01:09:46,282 --> 01:09:47,442
- Yes.

607
01:09:49,385 --> 01:09:51,512
Three years in the military.

608
01:09:53,255 --> 01:09:56,418
Desert Storm. Purple Heart again.

609
01:09:58,527 --> 01:10:01,394
Rocky Point is your case,
inspector.

610
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:05,466
At the shooting, he did not know the victim
is not related to Teena Maguire?

611
01:10:06,302 --> 01:10:09,430
The case is wrong.

612
01:10:10,472 --> 01:10:12,497
My colleague
does not listen to me.

613
01:10:13,409 --> 01:10:16,378
The story is, come on, John,

614
01:10:16,478 --> 01:10:19,311
he and Casey are naturally off the parking lot
together.

615
01:10:19,448 --> 01:10:23,282
No. Not necessarily a coincidence.

616
01:10:23,419 --> 01:10:26,411
To be fair,
is heaven.

617
01:10:27,256 --> 01:10:31,249
Yes God,

618
01:10:32,494 --> 01:10:35,292
to say the truth is I feel

619
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,368
naturally I have a goal.

620
01:10:42,271 --> 01:10:44,330
What is that goal? John?

621
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:48,433
John?

622
01:10:49,411 --> 01:10:52,471
He chose me
to enforce the law.

623
01:11:09,531 --> 01:11:12,261
Next week, Friday, 9am.

624
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:15,335
- I can go.
- My client did not go that session.

625
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:19,373
- Habour was busy,
but I was authorized by him.

626
01:11:20,242 --> 01:11:22,210
Next week is not possible.

627
01:11:22,378 --> 01:11:26,439
Unfortunately.
We do not need Lucas testimony.

628
01:11:27,249 --> 01:11:29,479
Judge, I need more time.
- I have a discussion.

629
01:11:30,386 --> 01:11:34,379
All 6 of Mr. Kirkpatrick
are present.

630
01:11:34,523 --> 01:11:37,219
I'm sorry.

631
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:39,224
But that day.

632
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:08,517
Okay, deal like this.

633
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:15,457
Reduce the charge of rape,
assault assault purpose.

634
01:12:17,366 --> 01:12:20,233
Light attack.

635
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:26,531
Keep the request in court
for Teena and her baby.

636
01:12:27,309 --> 01:12:31,473
18 months of the common good.
Guaranteed to go to jail for 3 years.

637
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:39,253
Did you meet Teena Maguire?

638
01:12:41,423 --> 01:12:43,516
Have you met yet?

639
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,488
I'm listening to this.
Have you talked to her yet?

640
01:12:50,466 --> 01:12:53,264
But she has tried.

641
01:12:53,502 --> 01:12:58,337
Come home. Persuasive mother.
And then the baby.

642
01:12:58,474 --> 01:13:03,207
I promise that everything will
change a lot when put to trial.

643
01:13:05,314 --> 01:13:08,408
The hearing testimony
is the hearing.

644
01:13:09,284 --> 01:13:11,343
finished

645
01:13:12,488 --> 01:13:15,423
Teena will not be returned to court.

646
01:13:17,292 --> 01:13:19,419
This Friday is not.

647
01:13:21,463 --> 01:13:23,363
He is a bastard.

648
01:13:23,499 --> 01:13:28,334
No victim. No witnesses
That kind of hard case.

649
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:34,342
At this time next week,
the case will be canceled.

650
01:13:43,385 --> 01:13:45,319
Do you think I will win?

651
01:13:47,389 --> 01:13:50,449
Jury trial
is not guaranteed.

652
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:54,320
= Enough enough.

653
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:57,422
He agreed.
Convent. 3 years.

654
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:02,397
- I'm all for one.
- Do you know what you're saying? We are the victims.

655
01:14:02,538 --> 01:14:05,268
That girl came to us,
sell herself.

656
01:14:05,407 --> 01:14:10,504
He said at that time we
were drunk and the police caught the wrong person.

657
01:14:11,313 --> 01:14:13,440
Thinking well, I see
3 years is not bad at all.

658
01:14:14,249 --> 01:14:16,274
Thinking well,
what do they do?

659
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:20,479
Mrs. Fick, on the jury,
must have someone arrested.

660
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:26,292
A good lawyer will advise her as low as possible.

661
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:29,488
- If we lose,
- I do not care if I lose.

662
01:14:30,332 --> 01:14:32,425
The minimum sentence is
20 years in prison.

663
01:14:33,268 --> 01:14:36,533
No, not.
I go to jail, do not go.

664
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:41,409
Dismissed. I swear to God.
Where to go.

665
01:14:41,543 --> 01:14:46,242
Do not give up where.
Put the whole house out.

666
01:14:48,417 --> 01:14:53,286
The family does not need to
decide right away. Talk to each other.

667
01:14:53,422 --> 01:14:57,415
We have already decided.
Teena is a liar, no one believes her.

668
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:02,294
My son will not plead guilty
for something they do not do.

669
01:15:02,397 --> 01:15:06,299
That's it.
Anyone who is guilty should take it.

670
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:46,364
Are we crying?

671
01:15:47,509 --> 01:15:49,443
No.

672
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:55,316
Ongoing.
Dog.

673
01:15:56,351 --> 01:15:58,319
Yeah, that's right.

674
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:10,491
Oh, I have not yet shaped apple pie.

675
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:14,358
I want to cake. Right in the middle.
Bad?

676
01:16:14,469 --> 01:16:17,302
A cake here,
have some way out  As it is hot.
So hot as to get out of the oven.

677
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:23,378
- I like that.
- MOUND.

678
01:16:24,446 --> 01:16:26,311
For my mother. Once my mother
made birthday cake for me.

679
01:16:26,515 --> 01:16:30,349
Instead of birthday cake
, mom makes apple pie.

680
01:16:30,485 --> 01:16:33,283


681
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:36,255
Do you remember the cake
birthday?

682
01:16:36,491 --> 01:16:39,255
birthday cake?
lm go dew.

683
01:16:40,495 --> 01:16:43,259
Yes, mom made bread
for me.

684
01:16:43,498 --> 01:16:46,399
- cousin
- I have not eaten so candles come out  I always eat.
The wax stick on my teeth.

685
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:49,464
The last few weeks.

686
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:52,365
- Well,
- What?

687
01:16:52,474 --> 01:16:54,305
You have to keep quiet.

688
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:56,308
What's up?

689
01:17:08,357 --> 01:17:09,415


690
01:17:12,494 --> 01:17:14,291
Does the phone have any good news?

691
01:17:14,429 --> 01:17:16,420
- You must go.
- Ồ.

692
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:20,491
Do you remember the cake?

693
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:25,205
While you remember the cake,
I remember the bell.

694
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:27,331
I will meet with an inspector.

695
01:17:27,409 --> 01:17:30,401
Is the law inspector
it?

696
01:17:31,513 --> 01:17:34,243
Tao does not understand
must meet the inspector.

697
01:17:34,349 --> 01:17:36,374
You do not do anything.
So they called me.

698
01:17:37,419 --> 01:17:39,387
Tao only... my bird... my bird...

699
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:42,252
Tao is done.

700
01:17:42,391 --> 01:17:48,352
I do not understand why
he calls you without coming.

701
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:51,489
He is a law enforcer.
. Keep your body clean.

702
01:17:53,435 --> 01:17:57,428
Tao told you.
There is no expectation in my lawyer.

703
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:02,499
So we are going to get all the evidence  on Teena, that's right.

704
01:18:03,311 --> 01:18:05,438


705
01:18:06,281 --> 01:18:08,476
We will have evidence
she sells herself, pretends to be robbed  Only conclusion is that.

706
01:18:09,317 --> 01:18:11,308
- That's good.
- Too good.

707
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:13,388
He's coming.

708
01:18:20,429 --> 01:18:21,487
money here.

709
01:18:29,304 --> 01:18:30,271
Now what? He came out?

710
01:18:30,505 --> 01:18:32,473
No, you came out.
You take things.

711
01:18:33,308 --> 01:18:36,300
- Between this rain that must be out.
- That right.

712
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:41,415


713
01:18:42,317 --> 01:18:44,478
- Let me take this.
- God, where did you get that?

714
01:18:45,353 --> 01:18:48,254
- Well I know a guy...
- Well your acquaintance...

715
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:50,449
What are you waiting for?
Out right now!

716
01:18:51,259 --> 01:18:53,420
What the hell are you doing?

717
01:18:54,529 --> 01:18:57,362
Why you never heard that.
Tao said then you listen.

718
01:18:57,466 --> 01:18:59,263
Do not scream.

719
01:19:00,469 --> 01:19:02,437
He is not in the car.

720
01:19:03,271 --> 01:19:05,296
- What?
- He is not in the car.

721
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:08,399
Take a look.

722
01:19:09,277 --> 01:19:11,404
There is evidence packet.
I have proof.

723
01:19:12,481 --> 01:19:16,417
- Tao thought...

724
01:19:17,352 --> 01:19:19,286
- What do you say?

725
01:19:23,291 --> 01:19:25,259
Who is it?

726
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:32,366
The bastard!
Bastard!

727
01:19:58,393 --> 01:20:00,452
Someone is shot.

728
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:05,266
He was attacked in the 72nd  Please be guided.

729
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:08,231
There is a beer tank.
There are 3 bottles.

730
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:12,236
What do you see?

731
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:20,439
Out of my house. This is my own house.
Get out of here now!

732
01:20:28,290 --> 01:20:31,453


733
01:20:32,294 --> 01:20:36,424
Listen, they are my baby,
they do not do that, they have something.

734
01:20:37,299 --> 01:20:40,291
We lost the house.
That is the story.

735
01:20:40,402 --> 01:20:44,463
Not true. I promise
they do not. Walt out here soon!

736
01:20:45,307 --> 01:20:46,467
Did you hear any news about your baby?

737
01:20:47,342 --> 01:20:50,311
They are my children.
They have told me something.

738
01:20:50,412 --> 01:20:52,380
Do you think she will hear from you?

739
01:20:52,547 --> 01:20:55,414
You want to know what happened?
Then I say this.

740
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:58,281
It is Teena Maguire.

741
01:20:58,386 --> 01:21:02,413
It was the one who pushed my baby like that.
Get out of here!

742
01:21:03,291 --> 01:21:05,350
What do you want...

743
01:21:05,493 --> 01:21:07,427
Get out of here!

744
01:21:16,471 --> 01:21:18,336
= Mommy.

745
01:21:19,241 --> 01:21:21,334
- Mother!
- Mom came here.

746
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:25,513
Mother, they disappear.

747
01:21:31,386 --> 01:21:33,445
I'm not sad.

748
01:21:34,389 --> 01:21:36,448
Oh, what if they came back?

749
01:21:38,526 --> 01:21:41,290
No, no you.

750
01:21:42,497 --> 01:21:45,489
I hear this,
they will not do us any more.

751
01:21:46,434 --> 01:21:49,369
I promise, Bethie.

752
01:21:49,537 --> 01:21:51,528
Yes.

753
01:21:53,508 --> 01:21:56,272
Their life.

754
01:21:56,411 --> 01:21:59,244
Do you want to go shopping with her?

755
01:21:59,381 --> 01:22:01,246
You go.

756
01:22:02,317 --> 01:22:05,411
- You stop along the way to buy food?
- If you can drive.

757
01:22:06,254 --> 01:22:09,280
So you must drive.
- Thanks Mom.

758
01:22:11,326 --> 01:22:13,260
Grandma, come on.

759
01:22:14,296 --> 01:22:15,456
Let's go.

760
01:22:32,514 --> 01:22:35,415
- I like teddy bears.
- We are the same.

761
01:22:36,284 --> 01:22:38,309
- She is shorter than that.
- Of course.

762
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:40,388
Look at this.

763
01:22:41,523 --> 01:22:44,287
Cute too go.

764
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:46,427
But no size of grandchildren.

765
01:22:48,296 --> 01:22:50,264
Let her go ask.

766
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:53,426
Sorry.

767
01:23:02,277 --> 01:23:04,211
Listen to me here.

768
01:23:04,412 --> 01:23:09,372
Before the boat house,
before your mother was raped,

769
01:23:09,517 --> 01:23:14,250
I have left.
You will say this in court.

770
01:23:14,356 --> 01:23:16,324
They have that.

771
01:23:17,459 --> 01:23:19,290
Bethie.

772
01:23:19,427 --> 01:23:22,294
Bethie.
What happened?

773
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:26,264
Hey, tell her go.

774
01:23:26,368 --> 01:23:28,302
Bethie.

775
01:23:31,339 --> 01:23:33,307
Hey, how about buying clothes?

776
01:23:33,441 --> 01:23:35,500
Con.
What is it?

777
01:23:36,311 --> 01:23:38,302
- I do not know. She...
- Let me go.

778
01:23:38,446 --> 01:23:39,470
Thank you.

779
01:23:40,348 --> 01:23:42,407
Bethie.

780
01:23:42,407 --> 01:23:44,400
f c i n e. N e t

781
01:23:58,266 --> 01:24:00,291
Hello.
Who here?

782
01:24:01,302 --> 01:24:03,293
Who wants to know?

783
01:24:04,372 --> 01:24:08,308
That's me.
I do not know if you remember me  but high school
I sit behind him.

784
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:12,346
Lou Hellen.
Right, Lou Hellen.

785
01:24:13,548 --> 01:24:20,283
- Welcome back.
- Heard he had some trouble  I can help you
about Teena Maguire.

786
01:24:20,455 --> 01:24:24,414


787
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:29,424


788
01:24:30,231 --> 01:24:33,325
About what you need to say
to the jury.

789
01:24:33,468 --> 01:24:38,235
- Should you tell me more?
- My daughter and I are staying in the town house.

790
01:24:41,543 --> 01:24:44,341
Well I know that place.

791
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:48,374
I should go with my baby,
then I will discuss later.

792
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:52,310
11 pm
Room 24.

793
01:24:53,421 --> 01:24:56,390
Oh, I also look forward to seeing your daughter
_.

794
01:25:46,341 --> 01:25:49,242
Lou Hellen.

795
01:25:59,521 --> 01:26:01,489
Lou Hellen.

796
01:26:19,407 --> 01:26:21,204
Sit down.

797
01:26:24,379 --> 01:26:26,370
Write.

798
01:26:28,483 --> 01:26:30,314
What to write?

799
01:26:30,418 --> 01:26:35,253
God forgives me,
I did what I believe is right.

800
01:26:36,357 --> 01:26:38,325
Why do I have to?

801
01:26:57,445 --> 01:26:59,413
Go kill her.

802
01:27:19,434 --> 01:27:21,299
hearted?

803
01:27:22,270 --> 01:27:24,363
Put your hands on the gun.

804
01:27:25,306 --> 01:27:26,398
No.

805
01:27:33,314 --> 01:27:35,305
Put your hands on the gun.

806
01:28:05,513 --> 01:28:07,413
Yesterday the defendant suicide.

807
01:28:10,318 --> 01:28:13,253
Again Rocky Point.

808
01:28:16,391 --> 01:28:18,382
We sent flowers for him.

809
01:28:33,308 --> 01:28:34,434
Mother.

810
01:28:35,376 --> 01:28:37,435
Mother. Cover.

811
01:28:38,279 --> 01:28:42,238
Ừ, we need more boxes.
About 5. We have to clean the cabinets.

812
01:28:42,483 --> 01:28:44,508
The story yesterday,
I'm sorry.

813
01:28:47,255 --> 01:28:49,223
It's not my fault.

814
01:28:50,258 --> 01:28:51,486
Are you ready?

815
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:55,386
yes. Yes.

816
01:28:55,496 --> 01:28:59,227
- Are you sure?
- I'm ready

817
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:02,369
- changed.
- Mom too.

818
01:29:07,442 --> 01:29:10,309
- Where are you going?
- I want to greet Annie.

819
01:29:10,511 --> 01:29:14,345
I also want to visit
a few more places.

820
01:29:19,487 --> 01:29:21,512
Do you want to go with me?

821
01:29:28,296 --> 01:29:30,264
Do you think I'm a bad person?

822
01:29:30,431 --> 01:29:33,298
Because I advocate for
whom you consider to be  - floods scum.
- You know, our country has a text called the Constitution.

823
01:29:36,337 --> 01:29:40,433
This text protects both  hostile forces, including criminals.

824
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:45,369


825
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:49,382


826
01:29:51,452 --> 01:29:54,421
Things are not in that text  is the use of violent action
as the street knight protects justice.

827
01:29:54,522 --> 01:29:57,389
Even cold-blooded homicide guys are not.

828
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:02,286
There are two things that
have the same thing  - Also not available.
- Now I understand.

829
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:08,233


830
01:30:09,370 --> 01:30:13,238


831
01:30:16,310 --> 01:30:21,213
Who knows, someday
you need my services.

832
01:30:24,318 --> 01:30:28,254
Then I hope
you will remember me.

833
01:31:28,316 --> 01:31:29,442
Hi there.

834
01:31:32,286 --> 01:31:34,345
I told you that,  I do not need much
real life hero.

835
01:31:34,522 --> 01:31:37,320
Her daughter
is also here.

836
01:31:38,326 --> 01:31:40,317
Sorry. Let the 2
uncle talk.

837
01:31:41,262 --> 01:31:44,425
Are you okay?

838
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:47,267


839
01:31:47,401 --> 01:31:52,270
- I seem to be stronger.
- I'm fine Mom and Dad are better now.

840
01:31:52,507 --> 01:31:56,375
Are you taking good care of your mother?
Do you want to go out to play?

841
01:31:56,511 --> 01:31:58,479
Try going.
The gateway over there.

842
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:05,241
Our children and grandchildren are about to leave.
Tomorrow. California.

843
01:32:05,419 --> 01:32:08,479
Goodbye.

844
01:32:09,323 --> 01:32:11,348
And thank you.

845
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:17,493
But they watched her mother.

846
01:32:18,466 --> 01:32:23,233
- Bethie. I will take your mother away.
- It's so scrary.

847
01:32:23,404 --> 01:32:25,497
bad things  often very hard to forget.
But will forget.

848
01:32:26,340 --> 01:32:31,243
I'm about to.
Forget to go to the next step.

849
01:32:31,412 --> 01:32:36,372
Leaving this place is wise.

850
01:32:37,285 --> 01:32:39,276
In California
have more warm sunshine.

851
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:43,251
I love you.

852
01:32:45,393 --> 01:32:47,384
You know,
uncle never had a daughter.

853
01:32:52,366 --> 01:32:55,392


854
01:32:56,404 --> 01:32:58,395
My mother never married.

855
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:01,299
And uncle?

856
01:33:02,276 --> 01:33:06,303
I told you,
if one day you have daughters  I hope she will be like me.

857
01:33:07,248 --> 01:33:09,409
always

858
01:33:10,318 --> 01:33:12,286
Hey John.
I have a call to this.

859
01:33:13,387 --> 01:33:16,254
Okay.
Goodbye.
