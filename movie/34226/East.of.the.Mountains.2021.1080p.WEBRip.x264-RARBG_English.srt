1
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,960
Hey. Come on.

2
00:02:05,994 --> 00:02:07,562
Beat it.

3
00:02:20,842 --> 00:02:22,510
Stay.

4
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,116
Hmm.

5
00:05:12,814 --> 00:05:13,881
Am I late?

6
00:05:13,915 --> 00:05:15,315
Oh, no! Hi, dad.

7
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:16,217
Hi.

8
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,350
Hi. How're you feeling?

9
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:19,253
I'm fine, I'm fine.

10
00:05:27,862 --> 00:05:29,831
Chris was
supposed to graduate this year,

11
00:05:29,864 --> 00:05:31,065
but because of the divorce,

12
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:33,100
he's just gonna take
a semester off.

13
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:35,736
Take a semester off?

14
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,404
Yeah, he wants to travel.

15
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,406
He's saved up some money, and...

16
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,018
You should come by the house.
He really misses you.

17
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:44,545
Well, Renee, I'm... uh...

18
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:45,746
I'm going to take a few days

19
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,249
I'm going to go hunting
in my old stomping grounds,

20
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:49,750
and I'm leaving in the morning.

21
00:05:51,052 --> 00:05:52,753
Oh! Who's going with you?

22
00:05:52,787 --> 00:05:54,222
Rex...

23
00:05:54,255 --> 00:05:55,255
And me.

24
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,926
I've been thinking about it...

25
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,928
For a while.

26
00:06:00,962 --> 00:06:02,362
Are you gonna go see
uncle Aidan?

27
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:06,701
No.

28
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:07,735
I just thought that

29
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:09,570
maybe now things
would be different than...

30
00:06:09,604 --> 00:06:10,972
What would be different?

31
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,377
So when will you be back?

32
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,613
Uh...

33
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:19,614
Thursday or Friday.

34
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:22,049
I'm okay, I'm just fine!

35
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,951
I just wanna go
over the mountains,

36
00:06:23,985 --> 00:06:26,354
and let the dog run around,

37
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,588
and walk a little.

38
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:29,624
Okay.

39
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:32,401
When you come back,
we're gonna have a serious talk.

40
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:33,728
A serious talk.

41
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:34,729
Yes.

42
00:06:34,762 --> 00:06:37,598
About you coming
to live with us.

43
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:39,700
You know.

44
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:40,911
If you have to start treatment...

45
00:06:40,935 --> 00:06:42,904
If.

46
00:06:42,937 --> 00:06:45,239
I haven't heard back
from the doctors at all.

47
00:06:45,273 --> 00:06:47,808
So it doesn't make sense
to talk about anything.

48
00:06:47,842 --> 00:06:50,878
Doesn't make sense.

49
00:06:50,912 --> 00:06:52,445
No.

50
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,757
Well, you know
that's what you say

51
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:55,458
when you just don't want
to talk about something. Right?

52
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:57,852
Well, I just don't want
to talk about it!

53
00:06:58,953 --> 00:07:00,713
Just like you don't want
to talk about mom...

54
00:07:05,026 --> 00:07:05,993
It's...

55
00:07:06,027 --> 00:07:08,229
It's late.

56
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:10,107
Dad, I'm sorry, I'm not trying
to box you in or anything.

57
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:11,666
Chris is in college now

58
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,110
and you just need
someone to take care of.

59
00:07:13,134 --> 00:07:14,168
No!

60
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:15,779
I'm just concerned
about your health, dad.

61
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:17,838
I'm not sure my health
is your business.

62
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:25,346
I've barely seen you
since mom died.

63
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:28,582
I miss you.

64
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:30,336
And I just want to spend
some time together.

65
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:40,493
I... I'm sorry.

66
00:07:40,528 --> 00:07:41,862
I have to go.

67
00:07:41,896 --> 00:07:43,030
Dad...

68
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:06,714
Come on.

69
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:15,423
Come on. Up you go.

70
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:18,092
Up you go. Come on.

71
00:09:39,914 --> 00:09:41,649
<i>Please
leave a message after the tone.</i>

72
00:09:43,484 --> 00:09:44,952
<i>Hi, dad, it's Renee.</i>

73
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:46,754
<i>I hope I catch you
before you leave.</i>

74
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:48,122
<i>I'm sorry about last night.</i>

75
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:50,257
<i>I didn't mean to offend you
or upset you.</i>

76
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,725
<i>I'm just not feeling that great</i>

77
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:54,795
<i>about this trip that you want
to take all alone.</i>

78
00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:57,498
<i>Will you please call me back
when you get this message?</i>

79
00:09:57,532 --> 00:09:58,499
<i>Thank you, dad.</i>

80
00:09:58,533 --> 00:10:00,901
<i>Love you.</i>

81
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:02,269
<i>Bye.</i>

82
00:12:02,557 --> 00:12:04,258
Oh!

83
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,394
Oh, Jesus.

84
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:01,516
Hey, how's it going?

85
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:04,051
Well, not great.

86
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:07,354
You got some car trouble?

87
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,492
Yeah.

88
00:13:11,526 --> 00:13:12,661
Need a ride?

89
00:13:12,694 --> 00:13:13,927
Well, I could use one.

90
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:16,196
I've got a dog, however,
and, um...

91
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,298
Some other things.

92
00:13:17,331 --> 00:13:18,365
That's not a problem.

93
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,333
Okay.

94
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:21,168
- Thanks.
- Need some help?

95
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,178
No service.

96
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:34,882
What are you gonna do
with your car?

97
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:36,083
I'll take care of it.

98
00:13:37,585 --> 00:13:39,019
Where you want us to take you?

99
00:13:39,053 --> 00:13:41,523
I was thinking of hunting
up in frenchman coulee.

100
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,191
Meeting friends up there.

101
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:48,228
Sweet climbing spot.

102
00:13:48,262 --> 00:13:49,262
Perfect.

103
00:13:52,433 --> 00:13:54,273
Look, I don't want
to take you out of your way.

104
00:13:55,336 --> 00:13:57,271
We're super flexible.
It's not a problem.

105
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,709
I appreciate it, really.
I do appreciate it.

106
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:19,527
What's his name?

107
00:14:20,695 --> 00:14:21,962
Oh, that's Rex.

108
00:14:24,632 --> 00:14:25,499
Are you from around here?

109
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:27,067
Oh, I used to be.

110
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:30,739
Do you still have
family out here?

111
00:14:33,374 --> 00:14:34,776
Not really.

112
00:14:49,423 --> 00:14:50,625
Are you okay?

113
00:14:51,726 --> 00:14:53,127
Oh, yeah, it's just...

114
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,428
Bad back.

115
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,364
I'm okay.

116
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:34,301
Stay.

117
00:15:41,643 --> 00:15:42,677
You got everything?

118
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,077
Yeah. I'm fine.

119
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:45,245
I appreciate you doing this.

120
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,280
Giving me a ride.

121
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:50,317
Um. Here you go.

122
00:15:51,485 --> 00:15:52,554
Uh. Some snacks for later.

123
00:15:55,022 --> 00:15:56,490
We thought you could use it.

124
00:15:56,524 --> 00:15:59,493
Oh, that's really sweet of you.

125
00:15:59,527 --> 00:16:00,862
Thank you very much.

126
00:16:00,895 --> 00:16:02,038
You sure you're gonna be
all right out here?

127
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:03,297
I'm gonna be fine.

128
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,298
Okay.

129
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:06,300
I'm gonna be just fine.
Thank you.

130
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,769
You have a good climb?

131
00:16:07,802 --> 00:16:08,803
Thanks.

132
00:16:08,837 --> 00:16:09,904
Okay.

133
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:15,577
- Bye, Ben!
- So long.

134
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:46,340
Come on.

135
00:16:51,846 --> 00:16:53,848
Come on, come on.

136
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:57,519
Come on.

137
00:17:38,793 --> 00:17:40,494
Ah.

138
00:17:42,664 --> 00:17:43,665
Okay, here we go.

139
00:18:00,648 --> 00:18:01,816
Okay, let's go hunting.

140
00:18:04,586 --> 00:18:05,620
Hold up.

141
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:09,188
Hunt 'em up.

142
00:19:05,013 --> 00:19:06,814
Hmm.

143
00:20:49,984 --> 00:20:51,652
Yeah.

144
00:21:56,984 --> 00:21:58,418
Okay.

145
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:25,746
Whoo!

146
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:53,601
Rex!

147
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:57,772
Dammit.

148
00:23:57,805 --> 00:23:59,439
Rex!

149
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:10,384
Rex!

150
00:24:17,892 --> 00:24:19,827
Get off!

151
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,395
Get off, dammit!

152
00:24:34,675 --> 00:24:36,377
Oh, god.

153
00:24:46,554 --> 00:24:49,690
Hey. You alone down there?

154
00:24:49,724 --> 00:24:51,158
Can you help me?

155
00:24:52,193 --> 00:24:53,327
My dog's hurt.

156
00:25:00,668 --> 00:25:02,236
You fuckin' shoot my dog?

157
00:25:03,337 --> 00:25:05,039
Your dog had my dog
by the throat.

158
00:25:05,072 --> 00:25:07,541
You coulda just kicked him off.

159
00:25:07,575 --> 00:25:09,143
Give him a good kick,
my dog'll listen.

160
00:25:09,176 --> 00:25:11,145
I did that.

161
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:12,179
He wasn't listenin'.

162
00:25:21,188 --> 00:25:23,324
Damn it.

163
00:25:23,357 --> 00:25:25,526
Your dog was gonna
rip my dog's throat out.

164
00:25:32,566 --> 00:25:34,935
Maybe I ought
to shoot your dog, too.

165
00:25:36,937 --> 00:25:38,606
You get down on the ground now.

166
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:46,547
Turn your head away.

167
00:26:04,265 --> 00:26:05,699
You killed my dog.

168
00:26:05,733 --> 00:26:06,734
I'm takin' your gun.

169
00:26:06,767 --> 00:26:08,202
I need that gun.

170
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:09,437
Shoulda thought of that

171
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,439
before you shot
my best coyote dog.

172
00:26:35,362 --> 00:26:36,430
Good boy.

173
00:26:36,464 --> 00:26:37,431
Hold still...

174
00:26:37,465 --> 00:26:39,066
Hold still.

175
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,841
Okay.

176
00:26:54,782 --> 00:26:55,783
Okay.

177
00:27:08,829 --> 00:27:10,197
I know.

178
00:27:11,398 --> 00:27:13,067
Don't do that. Don't do that.

179
00:29:16,524 --> 00:29:17,958
Shh.

180
00:30:07,174 --> 00:30:08,876
Hey.

181
00:30:08,909 --> 00:30:10,210
Hey.

182
00:30:10,244 --> 00:30:11,378
Do you need help?

183
00:30:12,379 --> 00:30:14,381
My dog needs help.

184
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,184
Let's get you into my truck.

185
00:30:40,174 --> 00:30:41,141
A vet I know.

186
00:30:41,175 --> 00:30:43,344
She's going to open her clinic.

187
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:13,040
You're awake.

188
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,044
You were sound asleep.

189
00:31:22,116 --> 00:31:23,818
He seems to be doing okay
back there.

190
00:31:29,624 --> 00:31:30,625
Anita's here.

191
00:31:44,672 --> 00:31:45,707
Are you the owner?

192
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,641
I am, yes.

193
00:31:46,674 --> 00:31:48,041
Thank you for coming out.

194
00:31:48,075 --> 00:31:49,143
Yeah, of course.

195
00:31:49,176 --> 00:31:50,896
I mean, when he asks me,
how could I say no?

196
00:31:54,649 --> 00:31:56,483
I'm going to open up
the clinic for us, okay?

197
00:31:56,518 --> 00:31:57,484
Okay.

198
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,120
Thanks again.
I owe you something.

199
00:32:00,154 --> 00:32:01,955
No, you don't.

200
00:32:01,989 --> 00:32:03,858
It's not necessary.

201
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,961
Okay.

202
00:32:14,101 --> 00:32:15,102
Ooh...

203
00:32:16,638 --> 00:32:17,639
Are these your stitches?

204
00:32:17,672 --> 00:32:19,106
Yeah.

205
00:32:19,139 --> 00:32:20,407
You a doctor or something?

206
00:32:20,441 --> 00:32:21,543
I was.

207
00:32:22,811 --> 00:32:23,812
What happened?

208
00:32:25,847 --> 00:32:26,915
Dog fight?

209
00:32:26,947 --> 00:32:28,716
Yeah.

210
00:32:31,218 --> 00:32:32,186
Where?

211
00:32:32,219 --> 00:32:33,454
Bird hunting.

212
00:32:33,487 --> 00:32:34,722
Okay...

213
00:32:35,857 --> 00:32:37,000
I'm going to give him
some fluids.

214
00:32:37,024 --> 00:32:39,293
I need to cut out your stitches,

215
00:32:39,326 --> 00:32:40,327
clean him up, sew him up.

216
00:32:42,129 --> 00:32:44,097
I'd say about $500?

217
00:32:44,131 --> 00:32:45,299
Okay.

218
00:32:45,332 --> 00:32:49,069
And he's going to need
to be here a couple nights.

219
00:32:52,907 --> 00:32:53,908
How are your hands?

220
00:32:56,644 --> 00:32:57,812
They're okay.

221
00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:00,347
They're still good.

222
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,282
I don't have anyone
coming to help me.

223
00:33:02,316 --> 00:33:04,051
And I would like
to get some rest

224
00:33:04,084 --> 00:33:06,053
before I have to
come in tomorrow.

225
00:33:06,086 --> 00:33:07,387
You mind helping out?

226
00:33:07,421 --> 00:33:08,422
Okay.

227
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,966
All right, I'm gonna give him...

228
00:33:17,998 --> 00:33:23,738
.32 mils of Dex...

229
00:33:26,173 --> 00:33:27,509
Good job.

230
00:33:29,711 --> 00:33:32,680
And now something for the pain.

231
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:36,049
Good job, baby.

232
00:33:52,466 --> 00:33:54,101
You don't mind the music,
do you?

233
00:33:54,134 --> 00:33:55,469
No.

234
00:33:57,204 --> 00:33:58,338
That's lucky

235
00:33:58,372 --> 00:33:59,741
because the other answer

236
00:33:59,774 --> 00:34:01,050
would have you
waiting in the lobby,

237
00:34:01,074 --> 00:34:03,545
where you'd still be able
to hear the music.

238
00:34:10,284 --> 00:34:11,251
You do these one-handed?

239
00:34:11,285 --> 00:34:12,987
I did.

240
00:34:14,054 --> 00:34:15,590
They're not bad.

241
00:34:16,624 --> 00:34:19,059
I was a cardiac surgeon
for 50 years in Seattle.

242
00:34:20,394 --> 00:34:22,030
Oh.

243
00:34:22,062 --> 00:34:23,230
You got stories?

244
00:34:23,263 --> 00:34:24,832
Yeah.

245
00:34:29,169 --> 00:34:31,071
Just, you know,
trying to pass the time.

246
00:34:32,172 --> 00:34:33,942
It will pass on its own.

247
00:34:38,813 --> 00:34:40,982
3-0 weblon
with reverse cutting needle.

248
00:34:45,653 --> 00:34:47,287
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

249
00:35:08,442 --> 00:35:09,443
That's very nice.

250
00:35:11,478 --> 00:35:12,479
I know.

251
00:35:14,381 --> 00:35:15,381
But thanks.

252
00:35:21,022 --> 00:35:22,322
Okay, so I have someone

253
00:35:22,356 --> 00:35:25,627
who comes in
a little later tonight.

254
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,794
She should be here shortly.

255
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:28,796
What about you?

256
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:31,198
You got a place to stay tonight?

257
00:35:31,231 --> 00:35:33,200
There's a motel up the street.

258
00:35:33,233 --> 00:35:36,037
It's on the way home.
I can drop you off.

259
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,639
Okay.

260
00:35:46,981 --> 00:35:49,216
Wow, this town sure has changed.

261
00:35:49,249 --> 00:35:50,885
Change is good.

262
00:35:52,219 --> 00:35:54,055
I could not get out of here
fast enough.

263
00:35:54,088 --> 00:35:55,089
Why'd you come back?

264
00:35:57,157 --> 00:35:58,458
My brother died.

265
00:35:58,492 --> 00:36:00,862
And my nephew needed
a stable home.

266
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:03,931
Mm-hmm.

267
00:36:06,668 --> 00:36:08,311
Well, thank you
for taking care of the dog.

268
00:36:08,335 --> 00:36:09,570
I really appreciate that.

269
00:36:09,604 --> 00:36:11,238
Yeah, no problem.

270
00:36:11,271 --> 00:36:12,507
All right, good night.

271
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,975
And thanks for the ride.

272
00:36:14,008 --> 00:36:15,175
Get some rest.

273
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:16,209
Yeah.

274
00:38:06,353 --> 00:38:07,989
All right. See you later.

275
00:38:11,491 --> 00:38:13,761
Yes, I brought
the Brittany in last night.

276
00:38:13,795 --> 00:38:15,029
Are you Ben Gibbons?

277
00:38:15,062 --> 00:38:16,329
Anita told me about you.

278
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:23,403
Okay.

279
00:38:26,908 --> 00:38:28,118
I heard you carried him
all day yesterday

280
00:38:28,142 --> 00:38:29,644
after he was attacked.

281
00:38:29,677 --> 00:38:31,378
He sure wasn't
going to carry me.

282
00:38:34,081 --> 00:38:35,750
Like carrying
my buddy in the war.

283
00:38:36,751 --> 00:38:37,718
World war ii?

284
00:38:37,752 --> 00:38:40,087
Korean war.

285
00:38:42,223 --> 00:38:43,490
How are you doing?

286
00:38:43,524 --> 00:38:45,736
Ben! What're you doing here?
I thought you'd still be asleep!

287
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,795
Hi! Uh...

288
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:48,830
I had to see him.

289
00:38:48,863 --> 00:38:49,831
He's been through a lot,

290
00:38:49,864 --> 00:38:51,532
so he just needs some rest.

291
00:38:52,667 --> 00:38:54,635
- Yeah.
- Hey.

292
00:38:54,669 --> 00:38:56,737
I have your number at the motel.

293
00:38:56,771 --> 00:38:58,139
I gotcha.

294
00:38:58,172 --> 00:38:59,640
Okay.

295
00:38:59,674 --> 00:39:00,851
Come on, Derek.
I need your help with something.

296
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:02,019
- Thank you.
- All right, see you later.

297
00:39:02,043 --> 00:39:03,343
Appreciate it.

298
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,460
Hey.

299
00:40:34,434 --> 00:40:36,170
You're usually faster than this.

300
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,975
I can do this all day.

301
00:40:42,944 --> 00:40:45,112
You'll be doing it all day
if you keep that up.

302
00:40:47,515 --> 00:40:48,516
Yeah...

303
00:41:33,094 --> 00:41:34,395
Hello?

304
00:41:34,428 --> 00:41:37,031
<i>Hi, Ben. It's Anita.</i>

305
00:41:38,265 --> 00:41:40,835
Oh, Anita. Yes, uh...

306
00:41:40,868 --> 00:41:42,837
How's Rex?

307
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:44,305
<i>I looked in on him
before we left.</i>

308
00:41:44,338 --> 00:41:46,440
<i>His vitals look a lot better.</i>

309
00:41:47,842 --> 00:41:49,310
Oh! Okay.

310
00:41:49,343 --> 00:41:51,012
<i>Have you had dinner yet?</i>

311
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,715
No? Dinner?

312
00:41:54,749 --> 00:41:56,417
<i>Yeah.</i>

313
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:58,919
<i>I'm going to be passing by
in about five minutes.</i>

314
00:41:58,953 --> 00:42:01,355
<i>If I slow down enough,
you think you could jump in?</i>

315
00:42:01,389 --> 00:42:02,723
Jump in?

316
00:42:02,757 --> 00:42:04,258
<i>Yeah.</i>

317
00:42:04,291 --> 00:42:05,893
<i>Come have dinner at my house.</i>

318
00:42:05,926 --> 00:42:07,495
<i>I mean, we sewed up
a dog together.</i>

319
00:42:07,528 --> 00:42:09,997
<i>I think we could at least
make it through a dinner, no?</i>

320
00:42:10,031 --> 00:42:11,665
Oh!

321
00:42:11,699 --> 00:42:15,403
Well, sure, I guess.

322
00:42:15,436 --> 00:42:16,670
Yes, that's fine.

323
00:42:16,704 --> 00:42:18,105
Thank you very much.

324
00:42:18,139 --> 00:42:19,840
I'll see you in five minutes.

325
00:42:19,874 --> 00:42:21,542
<i>Okay, bye!</i>

326
00:42:21,575 --> 00:42:23,377
Bye.

327
00:42:25,046 --> 00:42:27,248
Yeah, okay. Adios. Gracias.

328
00:42:29,216 --> 00:42:31,052
Hey, hey, hey.

329
00:42:31,085 --> 00:42:33,120
Did I mention I don't cook?

330
00:42:33,154 --> 00:42:34,155
Here you go.

331
00:42:35,156 --> 00:42:36,490
Well, thank you.

332
00:42:37,892 --> 00:42:41,062
Yeah, cooking is just
way too claustrophobic for me.

333
00:42:41,095 --> 00:42:43,931
It's like the walls
start to close in and... no.

334
00:42:43,964 --> 00:42:45,099
Derek though.

335
00:42:45,132 --> 00:42:46,367
Derek is a really good cook.

336
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,369
- Cooks dinner most nights, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

337
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,808
How are the tacos?

338
00:42:53,841 --> 00:42:54,841
Not spicy, right?

339
00:42:58,279 --> 00:42:59,780
My mouth is full.

340
00:43:00,848 --> 00:43:02,383
Told you.

341
00:43:02,416 --> 00:43:05,086
The owner
made it special for you.

342
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:06,987
Oh, well, that was very nice.

343
00:43:08,622 --> 00:43:10,991
Lot more brown faces here
than when you were a kid, huh?

344
00:43:12,093 --> 00:43:13,060
Ah...

345
00:43:13,094 --> 00:43:14,428
Most the pickers

346
00:43:14,462 --> 00:43:17,364
came from Arkansas and Oklahoma
in those days.

347
00:43:22,136 --> 00:43:23,204
Is that a marine plaque?

348
00:43:25,439 --> 00:43:26,807
Yeah...

349
00:43:29,977 --> 00:43:31,345
I joined,

350
00:43:31,378 --> 00:43:32,847
after my brother did.

351
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,848
Derek's dad.

352
00:43:33,881 --> 00:43:35,349
Okay.

353
00:43:37,051 --> 00:43:38,752
- Where were ya?
- Iraq.

354
00:43:38,786 --> 00:43:40,522
Then Afghanistan.

355
00:43:40,555 --> 00:43:41,889
Oh, boy.

356
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:43,924
Y'all right?

357
00:43:43,958 --> 00:43:46,193
Yeah.

358
00:43:46,227 --> 00:43:47,294
Ben was in Korea.

359
00:43:47,328 --> 00:43:49,296
Huh.

360
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:50,931
Were you a doctor out there?

361
00:43:50,965 --> 00:43:52,299
Oh, no, no, no...

362
00:43:52,333 --> 00:43:54,335
That's...

363
00:43:54,368 --> 00:43:55,970
Where I thought
I might be a doctor.

364
00:43:56,003 --> 00:43:56,971
Yeah.

365
00:43:57,004 --> 00:43:58,507
Did something happen?

366
00:44:00,007 --> 00:44:02,577
Yeah, my buddy got shot up
pretty much.

367
00:44:04,579 --> 00:44:07,047
I had to haul him back
to his aid station.

368
00:44:07,081 --> 00:44:08,682
I put him over my shoulder...

369
00:44:10,084 --> 00:44:12,052
And got there
and there was no pulse...

370
00:44:12,086 --> 00:44:14,523
So the doctor did what he could.

371
00:44:16,223 --> 00:44:19,026
And I was there,
watching it all,

372
00:44:19,059 --> 00:44:20,828
and...

373
00:44:20,861 --> 00:44:23,964
He had to slice the side of him

374
00:44:23,998 --> 00:44:26,467
so he could reach inside.

375
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,235
And he's telling me all this.

376
00:44:30,171 --> 00:44:32,239
He puts the heart in his hand.

377
00:44:32,273 --> 00:44:33,642
Inside.

378
00:44:33,674 --> 00:44:35,644
Starts squeezing it.

379
00:44:35,676 --> 00:44:38,379
He said,
"you kind of squeeze it...

380
00:44:38,412 --> 00:44:40,247
Like a new sponge."

381
00:44:40,281 --> 00:44:42,149
Squeeze it...

382
00:44:42,183 --> 00:44:43,484
Squeeze it...

383
00:44:43,518 --> 00:44:45,554
Not too hard...

384
00:44:45,587 --> 00:44:49,023
Squeeze it
so there's a rhythm to it.

385
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,027
And...

386
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,228
Suddenly, there's a pulse.

387
00:44:55,597 --> 00:44:56,830
Wow.

388
00:44:56,864 --> 00:45:00,034
And, uh...

389
00:45:00,067 --> 00:45:01,769
My buddy went home, got married,

390
00:45:01,802 --> 00:45:03,470
and had four kids.

391
00:45:05,706 --> 00:45:09,578
And I went to medical school,

392
00:45:09,611 --> 00:45:11,879
got married,

393
00:45:11,912 --> 00:45:13,582
and I have a beautiful daughter.

394
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:37,606
<i>I'm takin' your gun.</i>

395
00:45:57,626 --> 00:46:00,494
What are you doing here, Ben?

396
00:46:00,528 --> 00:46:01,996
What do you mean?

397
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:05,833
I mean, your car breaks down,
and you just abandon it.

398
00:46:09,537 --> 00:46:10,838
Yeah?

399
00:46:10,871 --> 00:46:13,240
I feel like you would've
gotten your car fixed

400
00:46:13,274 --> 00:46:15,610
and maybe even
come back to Seattle.

401
00:46:17,478 --> 00:46:18,680
But you didn't.

402
00:46:18,713 --> 00:46:19,880
You kept going.

403
00:46:21,949 --> 00:46:23,869
This trip must have been
really important to you.

404
00:46:29,356 --> 00:46:30,558
I have cancer.

405
00:46:36,797 --> 00:46:37,998
Have you told your family?

406
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:44,038
My wife died a year ago.

407
00:46:46,807 --> 00:46:48,008
What about your daughter?

408
00:46:54,014 --> 00:46:55,650
She's going to find out
eventually.

409
00:46:59,053 --> 00:47:00,321
I know.

410
00:47:03,924 --> 00:47:05,426
You don't know
what's going to happen.

411
00:47:06,761 --> 00:47:08,228
But I do.

412
00:47:09,764 --> 00:47:11,666
I know exactly
what's going to happen.

413
00:47:13,367 --> 00:47:14,703
Bedsores and bone fractures,

414
00:47:14,736 --> 00:47:17,471
bacterial infection,
fluid in my lungs,

415
00:47:17,505 --> 00:47:18,506
vomiting,

416
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:19,507
dehydration,

417
00:47:19,541 --> 00:47:20,908
cracked lips,

418
00:47:20,941 --> 00:47:22,811
dry mouth, pneumonia,

419
00:47:22,843 --> 00:47:25,179
the sensation
of being strangled at the end,

420
00:47:25,212 --> 00:47:26,356
and a final drip of morphine.

421
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:27,615
That's what's going to happen.

422
00:47:30,518 --> 00:47:31,519
That's how it would end.

423
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:34,589
If I let it.

424
00:48:24,572 --> 00:48:26,039
You miss your home at all?

425
00:48:26,073 --> 00:48:27,374
You know what I miss?

426
00:48:27,408 --> 00:48:29,577
Fireflies!

427
00:48:29,611 --> 00:48:31,278
- You ever see them?
- No.

428
00:48:32,847 --> 00:48:34,348
<i>They're magical.</i>

429
00:48:37,084 --> 00:48:39,687
<i>Come on! Let's go!
I wanna dance with you.</i>

430
00:48:40,755 --> 00:48:42,189
<i>Okay, okay, I'll dance.</i>

431
00:51:20,748 --> 00:51:22,750
Good morning, sunshine.

432
00:51:24,786 --> 00:51:26,688
Good morning!

433
00:51:29,189 --> 00:51:30,324
I'm sorry...

434
00:51:30,357 --> 00:51:33,126
I...

435
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,562
I fell asleep on ya.

436
00:51:34,596 --> 00:51:36,096
Yeah, damn near mid-sentence.

437
00:51:37,264 --> 00:51:39,634
It's all good,
I didn't want to wake you up.

438
00:51:45,773 --> 00:51:47,775
Well, I made you some tea,

439
00:51:47,809 --> 00:51:49,677
I washed your shirts,

440
00:51:49,711 --> 00:51:51,613
and there is breakfast
in the kitchen,

441
00:51:51,646 --> 00:51:52,680
whenever you're ready.

442
00:51:52,714 --> 00:51:55,248
- Oh. Thank you.
- Yeah. No problem.

443
00:51:55,282 --> 00:51:57,919
Take your time.

444
00:51:57,952 --> 00:51:59,353
Okay.

445
00:52:08,663 --> 00:52:10,765
<i>All right, see ya.</i>

446
00:52:10,798 --> 00:52:12,700
Thank you for the ride.

447
00:52:12,734 --> 00:52:14,201
You betcha. See ya later.

448
00:52:14,234 --> 00:52:15,670
Okay.

449
00:54:03,644 --> 00:54:05,113
Huh.

450
00:54:31,506 --> 00:54:33,784
This paper has to come out
whether there's any news or not.

451
00:54:33,808 --> 00:54:34,848
You ever think about that?

452
00:54:36,944 --> 00:54:39,346
"Honoring barrows.

453
00:54:39,379 --> 00:54:42,449
Former mayor Clint barrows
receives plaque for service."

454
00:54:43,518 --> 00:54:44,519
Breaking news.

455
00:54:44,552 --> 00:54:47,320
Two months ago.
You sat in that same chair,

456
00:54:47,354 --> 00:54:49,422
pushed your beer aside,

457
00:54:49,456 --> 00:54:50,858
kindly said,

458
00:54:50,892 --> 00:54:52,260
"this paper has to come out

459
00:54:52,292 --> 00:54:54,095
whether there's any news
or not."

460
00:54:54,128 --> 00:54:55,530
And then you read the headlines.

461
00:54:57,464 --> 00:55:00,134
S'cuse me, gentlemen.

462
00:55:00,168 --> 00:55:01,779
You don't happen to know
anyone around here

463
00:55:01,803 --> 00:55:02,870
that handles coyotes.

464
00:55:02,904 --> 00:55:04,539
You got a problem with coyotes?

465
00:55:04,572 --> 00:55:08,943
Ah. You're looking for
a man named harden.

466
00:55:08,976 --> 00:55:10,120
What's his nephew's first name?

467
00:55:10,144 --> 00:55:11,112
Ethan.

468
00:55:11,145 --> 00:55:13,047
No, no. Ethan's his cousin.

469
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,048
The nephew...

470
00:55:14,081 --> 00:55:15,049
Bill.

471
00:55:15,082 --> 00:55:17,718
Bill! Harden. Yeah.

472
00:55:17,752 --> 00:55:20,387
Lives up
on his uncle's orchards.

473
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:22,957
He runs his dogs
down here sometimes.

474
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:25,325
Hires 'em out to hunt coyotes.

475
00:55:26,661 --> 00:55:29,396
You know where I can locate
this bill harden?

476
00:55:29,429 --> 00:55:30,397
It's up near...

477
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:32,332
I can't remember
the name of the orchard.

478
00:55:32,365 --> 00:55:33,333
It's got a funny name.

479
00:55:33,366 --> 00:55:35,468
Ah, they've all got funny names.

480
00:55:35,502 --> 00:55:38,338
Hey. Buddy.

481
00:55:38,371 --> 00:55:39,807
If you do find bill...

482
00:55:39,841 --> 00:55:41,309
Word of advice.

483
00:55:41,341 --> 00:55:42,475
He's different.

484
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:44,411
Keep the talk on the coyotes,
you'll be fine.

485
00:55:44,444 --> 00:55:47,849
Thank you very much.
Appreciate that. Thank you.

486
00:56:00,962 --> 00:56:02,163
Hey, Ben.

487
00:56:02,196 --> 00:56:03,331
Anita is in with a patient.

488
00:56:03,363 --> 00:56:06,834
I just want to say hello to Rex,
see how he's doin'.

489
00:56:06,868 --> 00:56:08,269
That's cool.
You know where he is.

490
00:56:08,302 --> 00:56:09,804
Yeah. Thank you.

491
00:56:16,811 --> 00:56:18,212
Hey.

492
00:57:05,693 --> 00:57:06,794
I'm gonna write down

493
00:57:06,827 --> 00:57:07,938
my daughter Renee's
phone number.

494
00:57:07,962 --> 00:57:11,999
I want you to call her...
Have Anita call her...

495
00:57:12,033 --> 00:57:13,901
Ask her to come
and pick up the dog.

496
00:57:13,935 --> 00:57:14,936
Okay.

497
00:57:17,672 --> 00:57:18,673
Have a nice day.

498
00:58:24,839 --> 00:58:27,341
You are one ugly old man.

499
00:58:30,044 --> 00:58:31,445
Aidan.

500
00:59:22,096 --> 00:59:23,697
Nice place.

501
00:59:23,731 --> 00:59:25,499
If you say so.

502
00:59:28,736 --> 00:59:30,805
I was surprised
to get your call.

503
00:59:32,406 --> 00:59:34,408
Ben givens needs help.

504
00:59:35,443 --> 00:59:37,111
Wonders and miracles.

505
00:59:45,186 --> 00:59:46,787
How you doin', Aidan?

506
00:59:50,191 --> 00:59:51,926
I was sorry
to hear about Rachel.

507
00:59:54,695 --> 00:59:56,531
What's it been...
About a year now?

508
01:00:04,171 --> 01:00:06,774
What she ever saw in you.

509
01:00:08,476 --> 01:00:10,177
Wasted her good life.

510
01:00:11,712 --> 01:00:13,147
You think you made her happy?

511
01:00:15,015 --> 01:00:17,017
She didn't need me to be happy.

512
01:00:19,521 --> 01:00:20,754
How's Renee?

513
01:00:20,788 --> 01:00:23,357
I haven't seen her
since high school.

514
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:25,626
And I hear she has a...

515
01:00:25,659 --> 01:00:26,794
A son?

516
01:00:26,827 --> 01:00:27,795
Chris.

517
01:00:27,828 --> 01:00:29,497
In college.

518
01:00:32,666 --> 01:00:33,634
Ah, right.

519
01:00:33,667 --> 01:00:37,171
I think I've asked
all the right questions.

520
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:41,408
So why don't you just tell me...
What do you need?

521
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:44,845
Well, I'm lookin' for
bill harden

522
01:00:44,879 --> 01:00:46,615
and I understand
he lives in the area.

523
01:00:46,647 --> 01:00:48,482
I know him.

524
01:00:48,517 --> 01:00:49,750
What do you want with him?

525
01:00:50,985 --> 01:00:52,319
Just want to meet him.

526
01:00:56,591 --> 01:00:58,168
Rachel sent me a letter
before she passed.

527
01:00:58,192 --> 01:01:00,728
Did she tell you?

528
01:01:00,761 --> 01:01:02,129
No.

529
01:01:02,163 --> 01:01:05,600
I think she knew pretty far out
that this was her time.

530
01:01:07,001 --> 01:01:09,036
She wanted me and you
to reconnect.

531
01:01:11,872 --> 01:01:13,874
I said I don't see
a reason for that.

532
01:01:16,010 --> 01:01:17,646
There was nothin' between us.

533
01:01:17,678 --> 01:01:19,213
We just lived different lives.

534
01:01:21,583 --> 01:01:23,984
I got another letter from her.

535
01:01:24,018 --> 01:01:25,520
Short time later.

536
01:01:30,024 --> 01:01:31,926
It was a one-word response.

537
01:01:35,696 --> 01:01:36,697
Horseshit.

538
01:01:39,366 --> 01:01:40,768
She could be a real smartass.

539
01:01:42,537 --> 01:01:43,538
Yeah.

540
01:01:54,114 --> 01:01:55,584
I'm gonna go see
about some lunch.

541
01:01:57,718 --> 01:01:59,887
After we eat, I'll take you
to see the old ranch.

542
01:02:12,266 --> 01:02:13,400
Did you get any birds?

543
01:02:14,902 --> 01:02:16,303
Yeah, I got a couple.

544
01:02:18,272 --> 01:02:19,574
Where's your dog?

545
01:02:19,608 --> 01:02:20,808
You got a dog?

546
01:02:20,841 --> 01:02:22,977
Mm. Yep.

547
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:24,411
Where is he?

548
01:02:24,445 --> 01:02:25,580
He got tore up.

549
01:02:25,614 --> 01:02:26,947
He's with a vet.

550
01:02:26,981 --> 01:02:28,650
Uh-huh.

551
01:02:28,683 --> 01:02:30,784
I still do some huntin'
from time to time.

552
01:02:33,254 --> 01:02:34,221
When I'm in here,

553
01:02:34,255 --> 01:02:36,257
all I can think about
is being out there.

554
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:42,664
But lately, when I'm out there,

555
01:02:42,697 --> 01:02:46,267
I keep thinking how nice it'd be
to be back in my chair.

556
01:02:47,935 --> 01:02:49,537
It's getting old, I think.

557
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:54,441
You still have dad's gun?

558
01:02:55,776 --> 01:02:57,378
Why do you think
he gave it to you?

559
01:02:59,146 --> 01:03:00,180
I don't know.

560
01:03:00,214 --> 01:03:01,583
He must have wanted you
to have it.

561
01:03:01,616 --> 01:03:02,584
I mean he had a reason.

562
01:03:02,617 --> 01:03:03,585
I don't know.

563
01:03:03,618 --> 01:03:05,352
I... I...

564
01:03:05,386 --> 01:03:08,389
I just thought it should have
gone to me is all.

565
01:03:17,031 --> 01:03:18,032
You can't imagine

566
01:03:18,065 --> 01:03:20,301
what it was like
with dad at the end.

567
01:03:20,334 --> 01:03:21,603
I can imagine what it was like.

568
01:03:21,636 --> 01:03:23,237
No. You can't.

569
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:28,075
He felt pushed out.

570
01:03:29,343 --> 01:03:30,911
Especially after
the cabin burned down.

571
01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:37,217
The night he died,

572
01:03:37,251 --> 01:03:39,621
I was holding his head
in my lap...

573
01:03:39,654 --> 01:03:42,557
Trying to calm him down some.

574
01:03:42,590 --> 01:03:45,125
He would sleep shaking,

575
01:03:45,159 --> 01:03:48,228
and then jerk awake in the dark,

576
01:03:48,262 --> 01:03:50,264
afraid that
he was going to slip away.

577
01:03:52,333 --> 01:03:53,834
Which he did a few hours later.

578
01:03:57,204 --> 01:04:01,643
I was with him
when he sold off the land,

579
01:04:01,676 --> 01:04:02,644
when he was sick.

580
01:04:02,677 --> 01:04:05,680
I made his meals,
I did his laundry.

581
01:04:05,714 --> 01:04:06,880
I did everything right.

582
01:04:09,016 --> 01:04:11,485
And when he was gone...

583
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:13,521
What was left of me?

584
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:18,992
I wasn't the kind of man
that any woman wanted anymore.

585
01:04:19,026 --> 01:04:21,995
What did you expect of me?

586
01:04:22,029 --> 01:04:23,565
I had a practice. I had Renee.

587
01:04:23,598 --> 01:04:24,599
I...

588
01:04:24,632 --> 01:04:27,501
Couldn't take care of him.

589
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:30,839
You didn't even come back

590
01:04:30,871 --> 01:04:32,172
to help us
put him in the ground.

591
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:38,212
I was there for him.

592
01:04:38,245 --> 01:04:39,714
You should have
been there for me.

593
01:04:43,217 --> 01:04:45,419
<i>Aidan givens. Leave a message.</i>

594
01:04:47,822 --> 01:04:49,089
<i>Hello, uncle Aidan.</i>

595
01:04:49,123 --> 01:04:50,391
<i>This is Renee.</i>

596
01:04:50,424 --> 01:04:51,559
<i>I'm Ben's daughter.</i>

597
01:04:51,593 --> 01:04:52,636
<i>I know we haven't seen
each other</i>

598
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:53,695
<i>in a really long time,</i>

599
01:04:53,728 --> 01:04:55,195
<i>but I'm looking for my dad.</i>

600
01:04:55,229 --> 01:04:56,631
<i>He went hunting over there...</i>

601
01:04:56,664 --> 01:04:58,298
Are you going to get that?

602
01:04:58,332 --> 01:05:00,401
<i>If you hear from him,
if you see him...</i>

603
01:05:00,434 --> 01:05:02,302
I've lost my appetite. Let's go.

604
01:05:02,336 --> 01:05:03,470
<i>He had a car,</i>

605
01:05:03,505 --> 01:05:04,548
<i>it was found abandoned
on the old highway,</i>

606
01:05:04,572 --> 01:05:05,750
<i>and I'm very, very worried
about him.</i>

607
01:05:05,774 --> 01:05:07,441
<i>If you hear from him,
if you see him...</i>

608
01:06:36,063 --> 01:06:38,332
The new owners
tore down our old place

609
01:06:38,365 --> 01:06:40,334
and built a new one there.

610
01:06:42,035 --> 01:06:43,505
Not so new anymore.

611
01:06:50,612 --> 01:06:52,346
I have cancer.

612
01:06:53,848 --> 01:06:56,784
I've got a year
if I don't take treatment.

613
01:07:01,789 --> 01:07:03,925
Goddamn you.

614
01:07:03,958 --> 01:07:06,828
Sayin' something like that.

615
01:07:06,861 --> 01:07:08,228
Standing where we are.

616
01:07:09,931 --> 01:07:11,231
Would you even have called

617
01:07:11,265 --> 01:07:13,968
if you didn't need something
from me?

618
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:17,104
No.

619
01:07:19,574 --> 01:07:21,543
But I'm...

620
01:07:21,576 --> 01:07:23,210
I'm glad I did.

621
01:07:23,243 --> 01:07:24,244
Really.

622
01:07:31,084 --> 01:07:33,220
What do you want from harden?

623
01:07:33,253 --> 01:07:35,455
It's a long story.

624
01:07:35,489 --> 01:07:37,033
It sure as hell
ain't gonna be a short one.

625
01:07:37,057 --> 01:07:42,797
I mean, you out here
with no wheels, no dog...

626
01:07:42,830 --> 01:07:44,064
Dyin' from cancer...

627
01:07:54,008 --> 01:07:55,442
Harden's place is near here.

628
01:07:58,947 --> 01:08:00,582
Old palisades road.

629
01:08:04,184 --> 01:08:05,820
North star ranch.

630
01:08:27,107 --> 01:08:29,142
You want me to go with you?

631
01:08:29,176 --> 01:08:31,646
No. I'll go myself.

632
01:08:34,816 --> 01:08:36,183
This is it?

633
01:08:39,353 --> 01:08:40,888
This is it.

634
01:08:43,725 --> 01:08:44,959
Okay.

635
01:08:50,565 --> 01:08:52,066
Thanks.

636
01:09:23,831 --> 01:09:25,633
<i>Ben,</i>

637
01:09:25,667 --> 01:09:28,036
<i>do you understand
that I'm leaving?</i>

638
01:09:30,004 --> 01:09:32,073
<i>It shouldn't be a surprise.</i>

639
01:09:32,106 --> 01:09:33,941
<i>It's always been my plan.</i>

640
01:09:36,678 --> 01:09:39,080
<i>Somehow, I thought
maybe you had a plan, too.</i>

641
01:09:42,917 --> 01:09:45,019
I guess I did.

642
01:09:46,353 --> 01:09:48,623
But it wasn't this.

643
01:10:18,452 --> 01:10:19,520
Think about

644
01:10:19,554 --> 01:10:20,764
what you want
from your life, Ben,

645
01:10:20,788 --> 01:10:22,489
and when you've done that,
let me know.

646
01:11:04,999 --> 01:11:06,000
Bill harden!

647
01:11:09,971 --> 01:11:11,672
What the hell
are you doin' here?

648
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:13,975
I came to get my gun.

649
01:11:14,008 --> 01:11:15,251
It ain't yours no more, old man.

650
01:11:15,275 --> 01:11:19,479
The gun has been with my family
for a long time.

651
01:11:19,514 --> 01:11:21,916
It's not done yet.
And I'm not done with it.

652
01:11:21,949 --> 01:11:22,917
You better get the hell
out of here

653
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:24,519
before I lose my temper.

654
01:11:25,686 --> 01:11:27,955
Do somethin' I'm gonna
have to explain to the sheriff.

655
01:11:27,989 --> 01:11:29,289
Not without the gun.

656
01:11:30,825 --> 01:11:32,226
You're tresspassin'.

657
01:11:36,296 --> 01:11:37,732
Go ahead, do it. Shoot.

658
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:43,336
Do it.

659
01:11:47,175 --> 01:11:48,815
Goddamnit, shoot.
Go on, do it, damn it...

660
01:11:48,843 --> 01:11:50,144
Get your goddamned hands off!

661
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:53,714
You crazy, stupid
son of a bitch.

662
01:12:17,337 --> 01:12:19,073
I see you again,

663
01:12:19,106 --> 01:12:22,009
I'm going to hurt you
before I kill you.

664
01:13:39,687 --> 01:13:40,721
<i>Ben.</i>

665
01:13:40,755 --> 01:13:42,590
Come on.

666
01:13:44,792 --> 01:13:45,826
Come on.

667
01:14:11,886 --> 01:14:14,055
Do it, Ben.

668
01:16:11,939 --> 01:16:13,207
I came to get my dog.

669
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:15,309
Would you be so kind
as to open your clinic?

670
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:17,912
Of co... Get in here!

671
01:16:17,945 --> 01:16:20,781
God, you have no idea
how happy I am to see you.

672
01:16:21,916 --> 01:16:23,384
So that number
that you gave me...

673
01:16:23,417 --> 01:16:24,485
I hope you don't mind,

674
01:16:24,519 --> 01:16:26,521
but I went ahead
and I called it.

675
01:16:29,990 --> 01:16:30,958
Renee.

676
01:16:30,991 --> 01:16:31,992
Dad.

677
01:16:34,962 --> 01:16:36,297
Oh, my god.

678
01:16:37,298 --> 01:16:39,333
- I was so worried about you.
- Oh, my. Oh, my.

679
01:16:41,802 --> 01:16:43,737
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

680
01:16:43,771 --> 01:16:45,639
I'm so glad you're here.

681
01:16:47,308 --> 01:16:49,310
Dad. They said
that Rex got hurt?

682
01:16:49,343 --> 01:16:50,411
Did you get hurt?

683
01:16:50,444 --> 01:16:52,379
Rex is fine, I'm fine.

684
01:16:53,881 --> 01:16:55,249
I love you so much.

685
01:16:55,282 --> 01:16:57,184
I'm so happy that you're back.

686
01:16:58,520 --> 01:16:59,854
I'm so sorry.

687
01:16:59,887 --> 01:17:01,055
It's okay.

688
01:17:02,790 --> 01:17:04,325
It's okay.

689
01:17:22,343 --> 01:17:23,545
That's a good boy.

690
01:17:34,255 --> 01:17:35,256
Doin' okay?

691
01:17:37,091 --> 01:17:38,459
Yeah.

692
01:17:38,492 --> 01:17:39,594
You, dad?

693
01:17:41,095 --> 01:17:42,830
Yeah.
