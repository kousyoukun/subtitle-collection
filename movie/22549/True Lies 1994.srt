73

是没见过，否则绝忘不了你
We haven't met, because I certainly would remember.

它是公元前6世纪的作品

93
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,030
我替克莱买进不少
Acquired most of these pieces for Jamal.

94
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:48,460
你跳探戈吗？
Do you tango?

95
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:51,970
探戈？
Tango?

96
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:55,870
哈瑞，你没时间跳探戈舞啦，伙计
Harty, you do not have time to tango, buddy.

97
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,510
你听到了吗？
You copy?

98
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,760
别像猫闻到腥一样赖着不走
Don't be stopping to smell the roses now.

99
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:48,820
好不好？
You hear me?

100
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,020
你得马上离开
You gotta get out of there.

101
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,090

103
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,180
宝贝，我真是无往不胜
I'm in. I'm down, baby.

104
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,630
我已闻到她的体香，我要一亲芳泽…
I got my hand up her dress, and I am going for the gold...

105
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,360
快点拷贝文件，别没完没了的
Just copy the goddam files, okay?

106
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,930
哇！我本以为…
Wow. And I thought this was just gonna be...

107
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:35,170
这次又是些有钱人开的无聊聚会
another bunch of boring bankers and oil billionaires.

108
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,130
你现在是分秒必争，甩掉那婊子
Seconds count. Ditch the bitch.

109
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:41,870
曲终人散，我得向你告别
Unfortunately, I have to leave.

110
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,710
我得赶下一趟飞机
I have a plane to catch.

111
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:49,950
嗯，有空给我电话
Well, call me sometime.

112
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,350
我的办公室在罗马
My offices are in Rome.

113
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,260
我一定会的
I would like that.

114
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,200
天呀，才一会功夫
Son of a bitch is with her two minutes,

115
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,900
她就想跟他结婚生子
and she's ready to bear his children.

116
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,740
舞王，你打算怎么退朝啊？
Twinkle toes, what's your exit strategy?

117
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,270
当然是光明正大地从前门走出去
I'm going to walk right out of the front gate.

118
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,950
精神可嘉，但方法不可取
Ballsy. Stupid, but ballsy.

119
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:22,750
先生，我可以看一下你的请柬吗？
Sir, may I see your invitation, please?

120
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,620
看好了，这就是我的请柬
Sure. Here is my invitation.

121
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,190
糟了，我们快去接应
Shit. Here we go.

122
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,260
人算不如天算
Slight change in plans.

123
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:55,820
待着别动！
Stay!

124
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,780
我们正赶往下面的集合点
We're en route to the lower rendezvous point.

125
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:21,210
重复，在下面集合点支援你
Repeat, back-up rendezvous point!

126
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,670
小心！
Watch it!

127
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,850
傻蛋，冰上开车能不滑吗？
It's called ice, and it's slick.

128
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,600
哈瑞，你听到了吗？
Harry, do you copy? Whoa!

129
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,170
好了
I got it.

130
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:48,730
可恶！
Shit!

131
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,170
喔！
Whoops!

132
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,110
天啊！
Oh, my God!

133
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,360
哇！稳住！没事！
Whoa! I got it! I got it! I got it!

134
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,090
- 来了，来了！  - 要命！
- There he is! - Shit!

135
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,230
嗨，哥们
Hi, guys.

136
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,250
真不敢相信
That worked good.

137
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,190
你就这样大摇大摆走了出来
Right out the old front gate.

138
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,910
向后靠一下
Can you lean back a second?

139
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,470
走吧，我们还能赶上飞机
Let's go. We can still make our flight.

140
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,830
好了，这是哈瑞・伦奎斯特的
All right, that's it for Mr. Renquist.

141
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:15,930
我的呢？
Okay, go.

142
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,260
这是哈瑞・达斯克的皮夹…

146
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,770
这是你家里的钥匙
Got some house keys right there...

147
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:32,280
另外，这是瑞士雪村的纪念品
and I've got a souvenir Swiss snowing village.

148
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,670
- 干嘛？  - 送给达娜的，笨蛋
- What's that for? - It's for Dana, stupe.

149
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,150
给小孩买礼物，是做父亲的责任
Bring your kid home a gift, the dad thing.

150
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,370
真感人
Nice touch.

151
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,450
明天8点来接我
Pick me up tomorrow at 8:00.

152
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,790
好的
Will do.

153
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,690
他们10点听取报告
The debriefing is at 10:00.

154
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,320
- 8点见，拜拜  - 喂，哈瑞
- See you at 8:00. Bye. - Hey, Harry.

155
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,760
你是不是漏了样东西？
Did you forget something?

156
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,890
好兄弟！
What a team.

157
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,830
快去睡吧，好伙计
Sleep fast, buddy.

158
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:41,110
亲爱的，旅途愉快吗？
Hi, honey. How was your flight?

159
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,910
- 很好   - 那就好
- It was fine. - Good.

160
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:03,470
在瑞士买了这个雪村球送给你
Brought you a little gift from Switzerland. Snowy village.

161
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,300
谢谢你，爸，我从没有过这种玩具
Wow. Thanks, Dad. I've never had one of these.

162
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,670
一家人客气啥？
You're welcome.

163
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,970
快点，不然上学要迟到了
You're late for school. You better get going.

164
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,610
别忘了喂狗
Don't forget to feed Gizmo.

165
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:13,680
好的
Okay.

166
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,210
真差劲
It's pretty lame.

167
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,350
- 我要迟到了  - 我也是
- I'm late. - Yeah, me too.

168
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:26,960
展销会还好吧？
How'd it go at the convention?

169
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,960
是不是让别的推销员很嫉妒？
Make all the other salesmen jealous?

170
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:31,760
好得让你做梦都想不到
It was fantastic. You wouldn't believe it.

171
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:34,490
我真想让你看看我们是多么的风光
You should have been there. We were the big hit of the show.

172
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:38,070
我们展出了最新款680系列订货系统
With that new model ordering system, the 680 I told you about...

173
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,430
下单时，只要输入客户名字…
I can write up an order and immediately...

174
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,300
马上就能看到他的信用好不好
as soon as the customer's name comes up, you see what his credit line is...

175
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,810
过往记录，折扣…
what he has ordered in the past, what discount he has gotten.

176
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,000
所有细节都有
Every little detail.

177
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,210
听起来不错
Sounds great.

178
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,440
是很不错，我爱死这门事业了
It's fantastic. That's why I love the computer business.

179
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,580
水管工来电话了
Listen, the plumber called.

180
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,160
他说要挖个大洞什么的，要600美金
He says he has to dig under the slab or something that's gonna cost $600.

181
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,590
无所谓啦
That's okay.

182
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,920
有所谓！这是敲诈
It's not okay. It's extortion.

183
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,760
那你怎么对他说？
What did you tell him?

184
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:09,260
我和他上床，他减我100
I slept with him and he said he'd knock off $100.

185
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,900
辛苦你了，晚上见
That's good thinking. Bye, honey.

186
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,770
哈！
Hello!

187
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:40,530
达娜
Boy,

188
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,100
我第一次做炮弹飞人时
I remember the first time I got shot out of a cannon.

189
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,370
就是你这身打扮
I remember the first time I got shot out of a cannon.

190
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,270
早安，快去上学
Good morning. Go to school.

191
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:54,470
我是要走了
Yeah, I am.

192
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,940
谢啦，亲爱的
Thanks, dear.

193
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,710
试试这个
Check these out.

194
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,780
看看
Check them out.

195
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,220
影像从哪里来的？
Where's the image coming from?

196
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:08,650
那边的CCD香烟盒
Got a CCD camera

197
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,050
里面装有摄像头发射器
and a transmitter in a pack of smokes out there.

198
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,590
厉害吧？
It's pretty cool, huh?

199
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,830
搞什么鬼
What the hell?

200
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,100
爸，再见
Bye, Dad!

201
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,440
达娜

202
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:28,170
她在偷钱
She's ripping you off.

203
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,410
我就知道
I knew it.

204
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,080
快走！
Let's go!

205
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,150
太晚了，爸，我赶时间，拜拜
Can't stop! I'm late! Bye, Dad!

206
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,450
天杀的
God. Shit.

207
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,460
啥小孩，用10秒的喜悦换来30年痛苦
Kids. Ten seconds of joy, 30 years of misery.

208
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:49,470
我结过三次婚，从没蠢到想要小孩
I got married three times, but at least I was never dumb enough to have any.

209
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:53,000
我教过她，她不该偷钱的
She shouldn't be stealing. I taught her better than that.

210
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,110
她已经不当你和海伦是父母亲了
You're not her parents any more, you and Helen.

211
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,330
罗斯和麦当娜才是他们想要的
Her parents are Axl Rose and Madonna.

212
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,910
每天5分钟关爱
Five minutes a day you spend with her

213
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,110
怎比得上偶像巨星的威力
can't compete with that bombardment.

214
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,740
老爹，你太落伍啦
You're outgunned, Daddy-o.

215
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,040
这并不代表你不称职
It's not just because you're a bad parent.

216
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,150
现在的小孩…
Kids today...

217
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,050
比我们那会儿要早熟10年
are ten years ahead of where we were at the same age.

218
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,950
- 早  - 早安，达斯克先生
- Morning. - Morning, Mr. Tasker.

219
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,280
你一定认为她还是处女之身
I bet you think she's still a virgin.

220
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,390
别开玩笑了，她才…她今年几岁了？
Don't be ridiculous. She's only... What is she now?

221
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,220
14岁
She's 14.

222
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,290
她才14岁
She's only 14.

223
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,490
可她的荷尔蒙增长过快
Her hormones are going like an alarm.

224
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,930
说不定已跟哪个骑摩托的上过床了
It's even money she lets that physicist on the bike boink her.

225
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,830
- 达娜不会的  - “达娜不会的”
- Not Dana. - "Not Dana."

226
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,700
自欺欺人，你还当她是纯洁少女？
Denial. It's not just a river in Egypt no more, is it?

227
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:28,270
她偷钱…可能就是为了去堕胎
She's probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion.

228
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,030
你可以开门了
Why don't you open the door?

229
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:32,870
或是买毒品
Or drugs.

230
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,310
其实我常丢钱
Twenty here, 50 there.

231
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,110
还以为是我太太男朋友偷的
I figured my wife's boyfriend was taking it.

232
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,380
因为他什么都拿
He takes everything else.

233
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,180
连冰箱的啤酒都不放过
There's never a beer in the goddam fridge.

234
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,450
你不是搬出去了吗？
Thought you moved out.

235
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,780
又搬回来了啦
I had to move back in.

236
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,520
因为律师说…
My lawyer said

237
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,720
这样在分财产时对我有利
it'd give me a better shot at getting the house during the property settlement,

238
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,990
别换话题，你还欠我200块呢
but don't change the subject. You still owe me 200 bucks.

239
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,100
早安，珍妮斯
Good morning, Janice.

240
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,040
早安，先生们
Good morning.

241
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,470
请向扫描器确认身份
Identify yourselves to the scanner.

242
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,840
哈瑞・达斯克，10024号
Harry Tasker, 10024.

243
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,540
亚伯・吉普森，34991号
Albert Gibson, 34991.

244
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:19,050
（欧米茄部门，最后的防线）

245
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,820
好了，法兰斯
All right, Frances.

246
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,920
你可以离开了，谢谢
I don't believe we need you any longer now. Thank you.

247
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:40,100
怎么样，昨晚上“干”得爽不爽？
Sweet Jesus. You sure screwed the pooch last night, didn't you?

248
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:45,370
你让我怎么去面对你们的完败？
Would you please tell me how I can see this as anything but a total disaster?

249
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,690
“完败”这个字眼未免太过了吧？
"Total" is a strong word.

250
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,840
情况也并不是想象的那么糟
There are different degrees of totality.

251
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,250
总要一分为二
It's a scale, really,

252
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,250
一方面我们干得不错
with a perfect mission on one end...

253
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,620
而另一方面呢，我们是干得不爽…
and then a total pooch screw on the other, and we're more on this...

254
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,960
费絮，你是新加入哈瑞这伙的吧？
Faisil, you're new on Harry's team, aren't you?

255
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,400
是的
Yes.

256
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,430
你这菜鸟油腔滑调的
So what makes you think the slack...

257
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,730
不怕我革你职吗？
I cut him in any way translates to you?

258
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,270
我马上给你看我们获得的资料
Let me show you what we got.

259
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,600
我们怀疑克莱
Jamal Khaled. We think he's dirty,

260
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,840
就窃取了他的财务档案
so we raid his private financial files.

261
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,820
发现国际商业银行汇给他1亿美元
One hundred million in wire transfers from the Commerce Bank International.

262
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:25,850
肯定是某国付给他的恐怖活动经费
Which is a front for certain countries to finance terrorist activities.

263
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,790
也是我们认为会有大事发生的原因
That's why we think something really big is going down.

264
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,890
一周前，有4枚多重独立导向弹头…
We know that a week ago four MIRV warheads were smuggled...

265
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,090
从哈萨克斯坦共和国偷运出来
out of the former Soviet Republic of Kazakhstan.

266
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,020
我们断定是克莱买下了这批核武器
We think Khaled's group bought the nukes

267
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:37,260
并准备运进美国本土
and is trying to bring them to US soil.

268
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,710
说来说去都是我猜，我猜猜
So far this is not blowing my skirt up, gentlemen.

269
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:44,480
你们就没点实在点的东西吗？
Don't you have anything remotely substantial?

270
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,610
哈瑞，有没有确切点的？
Harry, do you have any hard data?

271
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:50,010
没什么可让你提神的
Nothing you would call rock-hard.

272
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,340
伤脑筋的事倒有一大把
Actually it's pretty limp, sir.

273
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,880
那你们最好在
Then perhaps you better get some...

274
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:55,710
他们找上门来，搞跨白宫前…
before somebody parks an automobile in front of the White House...

275
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:58,250
把他们干掉！
with a nuclear weapon in the trunk.

276
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,330
就是这么的平庸
It's not like he's saving the world or anything.

277
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,760
一个人前低三下四的推销员
He's a sales rep, for Christ's sake.

278
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,330
每回我睡不着
Whenever I can't sleep,

279
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,330
就要他说说一天的工作
I ask him to tell me about his day.

280
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:09,260
6秒钟不到，我就睡着了
Six seconds and I'm out.

281
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:12,260
他倒是自视甚高，自以为了不起
He acts like he's curing cancer or something.

282
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,130
听你口气，周末你们又没出去玩
I guess this means you didn't get away for the weekend after all.

283
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,640
哈瑞要出差
Harry had to go out of town.

284
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,810
难怪
I'm shocked.

285
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,770
唉，你知道哈瑞的
Yeah, well, you know Harry.

286
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,680
怎么啦？
What's up?

287
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,040
你看
Check this out.

288
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:29,890
克莱居然给了琼娜200百万
There's a $2 million disbursement from Khaled to Juno Skinner.

289
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,850
就是派对中的那个美女
That's right. The babe at the party.

290
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:37,960
这有什么？她一直在替克莱买古董
That doesn't mean anything. She buys antiquities for Khaled.

291
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,220
他把买古董的帐记在另一本帐簿里
He keeps his antique buys on a completely separate ledger.

292
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,940
根据最新市场买春行情
This is a little above market rate for the horizontal bop...

293
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,930
从来没人出过这么高的价钱
even for a total biscuit like her.

294
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,670
好吧，我需要她所有的资料
I want a complete work up on her.

295
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,070
知道她在哪儿吗？
Do we know where she is?

296
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,770
就在这座城市　　　开玩笑吧？
Right here in River City.

297
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,110
她虽住罗马，但也替史密森做事
She lives in Rome, but she does stuff for the Smithsonian.

298
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,710
有许多外交联络
She has a lot of diplomatic connections,

299
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,310
在这也设了办公室
so she has offices here.

300
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:00,010
看来是时候让专家出马了
I guess it's time to send in a specialist.

301
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,680
跳个探戈吧？
Care to tango?

302
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:05,020
我的荣幸
Yes, I would.

303
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,720
两个贱货
Assholes.

304
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,200
一切就绪，传真机、小灵通
It's all set up. You got a fax machine, ghost phones,

305
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,700
都是你称心的
all the usual stuff.

306
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,770
你以伦奎斯特的名义…
You have a suite at the Marquis Hotel

307
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,570
住在马盖兹旅馆
under the name of Renquist.

308
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,640
我们再演习一遍
Reality check. Let's go.

309
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,840
我叫哈瑞・伦奎斯特
My name is Harry Renquist.

310
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,470
在旧金山开设艺术咨询公司
I own an art consulting firm in San Francisco.

311
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,520
我和斯葛纳小姐有预约
I have an appointment with Miss Skinner.

312
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,690
- 哈瑞  - 哈
- Harry! - Hello.

313
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,110
哈
Hello.

314
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,120
我知道会再见到你
I thought I'd see you again.

315
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,650
但没料到会这么快
I just didn't know it would be so soon.

316
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:41,350
明明知道…我迫不及待
What's the point of waiting?

317
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:42,690
我同意
I agree.

318
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,190
听说你的客户在找…
Your clients are looking for something

319
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,490
能装饰大厅的艺术品？
for the lobby of their new headquarters?

320
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:51,530
给客人别开生面的印象
They would like to see something very dramatic.

321
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:52,530
让人刮目相看
They would like to see something very dramatic.

322
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:53,830
那件很不错
That's a nice piece.

323
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:55,840
我和好几个人谈过
I talked to a number of people,

324
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,740
他们都大力推崇你
and they all said you're the one to see.

325
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,840
真的？你在研究我？
Really? Checking on me.

326
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:05,080
他们到底怎么说我呢？
So what did these people say about me exactly?

327
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,450
说你能看得懂古梵文，而且很精通
That you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words...

328
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,590
但有些商贾和考古学家…
and other art dealers and archaeologists

329
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,290
却并不太喜欢你
don't like you very much.

330
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,630
那些家伙
Those wimps.

331
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:19,460
那是因为我能运用外交手段…
It's because I use my diplomatic contacts

332
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,430
购买一些珍贵古玩
to export cultural treasures...

333
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:23,530
而他们只能干瞪眼
from countries which tell them to take a hike.

334
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,500
看，都是些古波斯艺术品
Most of our pieces come from ancient Persia.

335
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:34,270
可惜都被埋葬在20尺深的地下…
Unfortunately, ancient Persia is 20 feet under the sand of...

336
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,310
伊朗、伊拉克和叙利亚挖到了宝
Iran, Iraq and Syria.

337
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:40,250
自然财大气粗，目空一切
Not the most popular places lately.

338
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,180
跟他们打交道
So I've had to become an expert...

339
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:45,380
黑白两道都要吃得开才行
in international diplomacy.

340
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,020
嗯，伦奎斯特先生
Well, Mr. Renquist?

341
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,960
有没有喜欢的？
Do you see anything you like?

342
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:56,560
也许吧
Maybe.

343
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,930
拜托，他们才不会…
Give me a break. I don't think...

344
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,030
在我的三明治里放窃听器
they bugged my tuna sandwich.

345
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,030
她向中东许多国家进口货物
She's importing stuff from all over the Mideast.

346
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:05,230
很可能也做洗钱、走私枪械的买卖
She could be moving money, guns, anything.

347
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,810
你一离开，小灵通就响个不停
The second you left, we started getting calls to the ghost numbers.

348
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,540
都在查询伦奎斯特
They were checking out the Renquist front.

349
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,180
继续监视他们，多派两个人过去
Let's step up the surveillance and put on two more guys.

350
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:15,280
马瑞，我说的是星期六
Maurizio, I said Saturday,

351
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,580
不是星期二
not Tuesday. Saturday.

352
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,620
斯葛纳小姐，我能和你说句话吗？
Miss Skinner, may I have a word with you, please?

353
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:36,540
蠢货，有头没脑的婊子
Stupid, undisciplined bitch.

354
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:40,210
看在钱的份上，我让你
It's a good thing you're paying me a lot of money.

355
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:46,110
你知不知道我们已经给人盯上了？
Do you realize there are surveillance teams watching this place right now?

356
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,190
你的电话也早已被人窃听了
Your telephones are almost certainly tapped.

357
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,580
而你却浑然不知，像个妓女…
And you were busy laughing and flirting

358
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:52,920
还忙着和伦奎斯特打情骂俏
like a whore with this Renquist...

359
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:53,980
我们查过他…
He checked out okay...

360
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,330
不怕一万，就怕万一
We do not tolerate mistakes.

361
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,200
那你想我怎么样？
What would you like me to do?

362
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,640
找出伦奎斯特的住处
Find out where this Renquist is.

363
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:10,930
这是泰可公司达斯克先生办公室
Hello, Tektel Systems. Mr. Tasker's office.

364
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,440
萧玲吗？我是海伦，我先生在吗？
Hi, Charlene? Hi, it's Helen. Is he in?

365
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,740
他在开会，达斯克夫人
Harry's in a sales meeting, Mrs. Tasker.

366
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,740
我试试，请稍等
Let me try him in there. Hold, please.

367
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:20,380
转给10024号
Relay, 10024.

368
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,880
“打电话者的身份是1168”

369
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,780
是找泰可公司的电话
It's a patch from Tektel.

370
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:26,550
海伦打来的
It's Helen.

371
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:30,080
甜心，你好，有什么事？
Hello, honey. How are you? What's going on?

372
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,190
对不起，打扰你开会了
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you in the middle of a meeting.

373
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,830
我和达娜想知道
It's just that Dana and I want to make sure

374
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,730
你会不会8点准时到家
you were gonna be home by 8:00.

375
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:37,030
为准备你的生日
We're going to a lot of trouble for your big birthday.

376
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,230
我们花了不少心思
We just wanted to make sure

377
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,930
所以要确定你一定会回家
that you were gonna be home.

378
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:44,270
没问题，一定会准时到家
Absolutely. This time you can count on me.

379
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,780
- 保证？  - 我保证
- Promise? - Trust me.

380
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,570
- 很好  - 就这样了
- Great. - Got to go. Bye.

381
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:48,610
再见
Bye.

382
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,440
达娜，你有病啊？
That's disgusting, Dana.

383
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:51,850
别激动嘛
Calm down.

384
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:58,320
有人在跟踪，在内线道的第三辆车
We got a friend. Three cars back on the inside lane.

385
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,680
自从离开旅馆后就一直跟踪
They've been on us since we left the hotel.

386
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,760
是那辆旅行车吗？　　　对
- You mean the station wagon? - Yes.

387
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,830
要我甩掉他们吗？
You want me to lose them?

388
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:07,400
不要，我们需要这条线索
No. We need this lead.

389
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:09,730
第七组在吗？
Unit Seven?

390
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,030
第七组在这里
Seven here.

391
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,640
你们3分钟后到乔治城购物中心
We need you at the Georgetown Mall in three minutes.

392
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,600
听到了，马上出发
Copy. We're rolling.

393
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,840
海伦会气死
Helen's gonna be pissed.

394
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:21,180
最烦恐怖份子这点
This is the problem with terrorists.

395
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:24,280
他们一点也不替别人着想
They're really inconsiderate when it comes to people's schedules.

396
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,890
太靠近了，离远点

397
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,920
好，在这里停车
Pull over here. This is good.

398
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,730
试音，一、二、三
Okay, testing, one, two, three.

399
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,560
我听到了
I got you. I got you. I got you.

400
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:52,310
他们一直跟着我们，车里有3个人
They're right with us. I make three of them in the car.

401
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:04,650
白痴
Dick head.

402
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,720
猪头
Blow me.

403
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,440
有两个人下车去跟踪你
I got a couple of them getting out of the car and coming after you.

404
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,370
你当我瞎的？
Think I'm blind?

405
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:29,040
你是有点像雷・查尔斯
You do look like Ray Charles.

406
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,440
有什么计划？
So what's the plan?

407
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:33,150
先跟他们来个亲密接触
Just trying to get a closer look at Beavis and Butt-head.

408
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:35,650
第三个人还在车里
There's a third one still in the car.

409
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,650
你看着他
Stay on him.

410
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:02,510
海伦，我是吉普…没什么
Hi, Helen. Yeah, it's Gib. Oh, not much.

411
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:03,850
是这样的
Listen,

412
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:06,650
哈瑞又回公司去拿东西了
Harry forgot something back at the office.

413
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,650
你也知道哈瑞记性不好
You know Harry.

414
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:12,650
是的，吉普，我很清楚他，再见
Yeah, Gib, I know Harry. Bye.

415
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,050
一会见
Bye. See you soon.

416
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,460
我就猜到
See?

417
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:01,000
哈瑞，第三个家伙不见了
I lost the third guy.

418
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:41,780
天啊
Shit!

419
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:47,880
要命
Shit!

420
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,850
停一下！该死
Hold it! Shit!

421
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:42,400
冲个凉吧
Here. Cool off.

422
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:03,220
抱歉，吓到你了
Sorry about this.

423
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:11,400
小心，让路
Look out! Get out of the way!

424
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,360
嘿，别动
Hey! Freeze!

425
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:30,150
真是老天保佑
Oh, thank God.

426
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,830
开车
Get in the car.

427
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,770
看我的啦
Here we go.

428
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,850
我是联邦警官，正在追疑犯
Federal officer in pursuit of suspect.

429
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:25,870
对不起
Sorry.

430
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:42,280
哈瑞，你在哪里？
Harry, what's your 20?

431
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,490
公园的西面
Westbound in the park.

432
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,820
疑犯骑摩托车
Suspect is on a motorcycle,

433
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,320
马上会到法兰克林街
and he's coming out on Franklin.

434
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:48,050
知道了
Copy!

435
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:51,090
为预防他朝南转，我要你到14街去
I want you on 14th in case he turns south.

436
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:53,960
还有第七组到北边，好包围他
I want Seven on the north side to box him in.

437
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:58,860
要快，因为我马快不行了
Make it quick, because my horse is getting tired.

438
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,810
你的马？
Your horse?

439
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,320
他在那里
There he is! That's him!

440
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,680
快！
Come on!

441
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,700
绕到后面去
Go around to the back.

442
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:36,840
知道了
Copy that.

443
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,380
别挡着我
Out of my way!

444
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,260
走开
Out of my way!

445
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,190
抱歉
Sorry.

446
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,450
借光
Excuse me.

447
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,840
- 我的天！  - 对不起
- Jesus! - Sorry.

448
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:14,170
开门
Open it!

449
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:19,050
抱歉，借过一下
Excuse me. Excuse me.

450
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,690
走开
Out of the way!

451
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:41,960
让开！快让路！
Move! Move! Move!

452
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:46,540
我们是联邦警官
Federal officer!

453
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,040
马上下车弃械投降
Get down! Now! Get off or die!

454
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:51,000
- 马上下车！  - 让开
- Get down! Now! - Move!

455
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,910
转过去，不准动！
Turn around! Hold still!

456
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,780
快点
Come on!

457
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:05,560
哇！
Whoa!

458
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,200
不准动！
Hold still!

459
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,580
请你替我按顶楼，好吗？
Will you press the button for the top floor, please?

460
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:29,290
谢谢你
Thank you.

461
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:35,990
救命！
Help!

462
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:37,390
闭嘴！
Shut up!

463
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:43,600
你说句话呀！
Say something.

464
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,300
好个大种马
That's a fine animal.

465
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,850
靠着窗玻璃
Stay against the glass!

466
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:09,990
准备出发了
Come on.

467
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,830
实在对不起
So sorry.

468
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,570
待在这儿，不准动！
Stay there! Don't move!

469
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,860
走，快走！
Come on, come on, come on!

470
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:37,680
好，向后退
Okay, back up.

471
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,450
退后
Back up.

472
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:45,550
你行的，加点劲
You can do it. Come on.

473
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,220
马儿，你真乖
Good horse. Good.

474
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:50,790
对，对，向后退
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, go back now.

475
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,700
加油，发挥团队精神
Come on. Yeah, that's teamwork now.

476
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:55,260
继续拉，别停
Keep pulling. Come on.

477
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,170
再多拉点儿
A little bit more.

478
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:01,800
马儿乖
That a boy.

479
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,110
好了
Okay.

480
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,450
你脑子里都在想什么啊？
What the hell were you thinking?

481
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:24,830
都是你坏的事，让他逃跑了
I had the guy, and you let him get away.

482
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,030
我讲话时要看着我
Look at me when I talk to you.

483
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,130
你算什么警察嘛？
What kind of a cop are you anyway?

484
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:50,880
嗨，亲爱的
Hi, honey.

485
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:58,590
我知道你很不高兴，对不起
I know you're upset. I'm sorry.

486
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,260
不过，我尽快赶回来了
I hurried home as fast as I could.

487
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:06,960
没关系
It's okay.

488
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,060
没关系
It's okay.

489
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:13,540
真对不起
I'm sorry.

490
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,110
谢谢你给我过生日
Thank you for the party.

491
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,570
派对是很不错
Yeah, it was great.

492
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,160
嘿
Hey.

493
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:39,830
就是他
That's him.

494
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,540
在那儿暂停
Pause it right there.

495
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,770
他叫萨里姆・阿布・阿兹
Salim Abu Aziz.

496
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:47,180
这家伙是真正的狂热份子
This guy is really hard-core. Highly fanatical.

497
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:48,810
他脑筋有问题
The man's a real psycho.

498
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:51,310
和许多汽车爆炸案有关
He's been linked to dozens of car bombings.

499
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,580
去年罗马咖啡厅的爆炸案
You know that cafe bomb in Rome last year?

500
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,680
就是他的杰作
That was his.

501
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,520
还有里斯本的727案件
As well as a 727 out of Lisbon.

502
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:58,920
他是恐怖份子
This guy's a major player.

503
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,320
他甚至组织自己的党派
Now he's formed his own splinter faction

504
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,490
称为红伐党
called Crimson Jihad.

505
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,890
他认为别的恐怖组织太温和
I guess he thought the other terrorists were too warm and fuzzy for him.

506
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,120
他们称他为沙蜘蛛
They call him the Sand Spider.

507
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:08,730
为什么？
Why?

508
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:10,930
可能是因为听起来很恐怖吧
Probably because it sounds scary.

509
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,300
各位，很不错
This is impressive, gentlemen.

510
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:17,540
但如果能知道他在哪就更好了
It would be even more impressive if you actually knew where he was.

511
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,870
我们会找到他的
We'll get him.

512
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:21,900
拜托在这停一下
Why don't you pull over here?

513
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:22,910
为什么？
What's up?

514
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:26,980
昨晚我让海伦很失望
I really screwed up with Helen last night.

515
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:32,500
所以想请她去个吃午餐
I'm going to see if she's available for lunch

516
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:34,150
好好安抚一下
to smooth things over.

517
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,050
要我等你吗？
You just want me to hang?

518
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:37,160
好
Just hang.

519
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,800
那我就等你
I'll just be hanging.

520
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:47,000
请等一下
Hold, please.

521
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,570
二线是你的神秘情人
It's your mystery man on two.

522
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:51,300
是西蒙吗？
Simon?

523
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:54,700
喔，我的天
Oh, my God.

524
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:00,680
喂，是西蒙吗？
Hello? Simon?

525
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:02,250
西蒙？
Simon?

526
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:05,110
是，没有别人
Yes, I can talk.

527
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,790
你是说现在？
You mean right now?

528
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,960
好，我们可以见面
Yes, I can meet you.

529
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:15,900
我等不及了
Okay, I can't wait.

530
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:17,630
再见
Bye.

531
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:20,600
你能不能代我1个钟头？
Can you cover me for an hour?

532
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:23,300
1个钟头就能完事？太快了吧？
Just an hour? You should tell that stud to take more time.

533
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:27,310
别那么大声，当初真不该告诉你
Would you shut up? I should have never told you about him.

534
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:31,310
好好享受
Have a good time.

535
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,410
别忘了我呀
Get a little bit for me while you're at it.

536
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:46,460
喂，停一下！
Hey! Hold it!

537
00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:48,290
混蛋！
Fucker!

538
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:49,830
怎么搞的？病了吗？
What's going on? Sick?

539
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:51,430
怎么像见了鬼似的
Looks like you got gut-kicked.

540
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:56,940
是海…海伦
It's Hel... It's Helen... It's Helen.

541
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:59,840
我猜和海伦有关
It has something to do with Helen, I'm guessing.

542
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:01,240
海伦…
Helen...

543
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:02,710
海伦…
Helen...

544
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:04,210
海伦她…
Helen is...

545
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:07,110
她有婚外恋
is having an affair.

546
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:13,450
老兄，欢迎加入绿帽俱乐部
Welcome to the club, man.

547
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:15,620
怎么会是海伦？
It can't be. Not Helen.

548
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:18,060
刚开始都认为不可能，伙计
Nobody thinks it could happen to them the first time.

549
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,030
我第二任太太也是这样，记得吗？
Same thing happened to me with wife number two, remember?

550
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:22,570
当初毫无迹象
I had no idea nothing was going on.

551
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:24,570
一回家东西全搬空了
I come home, and the house is empty.

552
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:28,240
她居然把制冰盒也拿走了
She even took the ice cube trays out of the freezer.

553
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:33,070
你说，这婊子要制冰盒干嘛呢？
What kind of a sick bitch takes the ice cube trays out of the freezer?

554
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:35,910
海伦不会的
It's not Helen.

555
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:38,710
嘿，哈瑞，听着，海伦仍然爱你
Helen still loves you.

556
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:42,220
她只想找点刺激，没什么大不了的
She just wants to bang this guy for a while. It's nothing serious.

557
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:43,550
你很快就会习惯
You'll get used to it soon

558
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:46,120
别再安慰我
Stop cheering me up!

559
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:51,020
那你认为该怎么样呢？
What'd you expect?

560
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:52,860
她是活生生的女人
Helen's a flesh-and-blood woman,

561
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,260
而你成天不在家
and you're never there.

562
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:56,000
这是迟早的事
It was just a matter of time.

563
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:06,180
我建议你，伙计，还是以事业为重
I say we concentrate on work.

564
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,770
每次我受到打击，就这么做
That's what I do every time my life turns to dog shit.

565
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:10,880
致力于工作，伤口就会慢慢抚平
I concentrate on work, and that gets me by.

566
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:12,980
放心，伙计，你会很忙的
Right, buddy? It's gonna be great.

567
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:14,720
知道吗，多抓恐怖份子
We're gonna catch some terrorists.

568
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:16,120
然后修理他们
We're gonna beat the crap out of them.

569
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:18,280
你会觉得很有成就感呢
You're going to feel a hell of a lot better.

570
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:21,690
小心头，你别愁了
Watch your head. Okay. All right.

571
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:32,730
女人，相处不能，宰杀不得
Women. Can't live with 'em, can't kill 'em.

572
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:51,380
我今天到你办公室去了
I came by your office today.

573
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:54,290
因为我在附近办事
I was in the area,

574
00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:56,090
想邀你出去吃饭
and I thought you might want to have lunch.

575
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:00,460
真的？那你一定刚好与我错过了
Really? Well, you must have just missed me.

576
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,700
没错，你同事说你有事出去了
That's what they said. They said you had to run out or something.

577
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:06,670
因为有份急件…
It was this rush job

578
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:10,730
地方法院等着要
They needed these documents down at the district courthouse.

579
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:15,100
可是我们的打印机坏了
So, of course, the big problem... our printer shut down.

580
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:19,250
我只好到三楼去印，可惜机种不同
So I went to the third floor to use theirs,

581
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,050
磁片格式不兼容
but they have the 1720.

582
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:22,850
1720打印机印不了
Of course, the disk isn't formatted for the 1720.

583
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:25,850
只好又回到楼上重新格式化
So I had to go back upstairs and reformat...

584
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:28,390
再回到楼下去用他们的打印机
go back downstairs and use their printer.

585
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:32,190
好不容易弄好了，车又不能发动
By the time I got there, I couldn't get my car to start.

586
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:34,800
然后交通又…我几乎没赶到
Then traffic... I barely got there.

587
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:41,900
这就是你的小插曲
So a little excitement in an otherwise dull day.

588
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:43,910
结果如何？
Did it work out okay?

589
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:48,210
喔，很好
Yeah. Great.

590
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,280
我去拿甜点
I'll check on dessert.

591
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,310
我吃完了
I'm done.

592
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:02,720
好处是…他让我们全权处理
The great thing is that he's practically given us a blank cheque on wiretaps.

593
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:05,760
我现在正监听琼娜的手下和客户
I set them up on all of Juno's shipping agents and her clients.

594
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:07,830
费絮把红伐党在美国…
Faisil's made a list of all the possible contacts...

595
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:09,730
可能接触的列了表
the Crimson Jihad may have in this country.

596
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,730
所以我们只要坐着…
Now all we have to do is sit around...

597
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:17,940
难道这种国家安全大事…
Hey. This national security stuff boring you?

598
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:19,540
还会让你无聊吗？
Hey. This national security stuff boring you?

599
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:21,100
我要监听她的电话
Put a tap on her phone.

600
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:22,940
已经在监听了
What? I already did that.

601
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,370
我是指海伦
I'm talking about Helen's.

602
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:27,170
我要监听她公司和家里电话
Put a tap on her office line and the house. Now.

603
00:48:27,390 --> 00:48:30,220
好主意，你过来一下
Come over here for a second. That sounds great.

604
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:33,450
让我来告诉你吧，两个字：
I want to ask you about something. I got two words to describe that idea...

605
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:34,420
“疯狂”
In-sane.

606
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,420
你知道未经许可监听犯法
An unauthorized wiretap's a felony. You know that.

607
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:40,430
你天天都在做，少跟我说教
And you're doing it 20 times a day, so don't give me that crap.

608
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:41,830
快去
Do it.

609
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:54,440
（男性压低声音）

610
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:55,310
喂
Hello?

611
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,910
海伦，我是西蒙，讲话安全吗？
Helen, it's Simon. Is it safe to talk?

612
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:00,080
可以
Yes, go ahead.

613
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:02,220
不能讲太久，我要见你
I can't talk long.

614
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:04,320
明天一起吃午餐好吗？
Can you meet me for lunch tomorrow? I must see you.

615
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:05,980
我想可以，在哪里？
I suppose so. Where?

616
00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:08,860
1点钟，老地方
Same place, 1:00.

617
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:11,660
我得走了，明天见
I have to go now. See you tomorrow.

618
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:14,600
记住，我需要你
Remember, I need you.

619
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:36,150
明天一起吃午饭好吗？
I thought that we might have lunch together tomorrow.

620
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:41,360
哎呀…真不巧
You know... darn it...

621
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:44,890
我和艾丽约好去逛街
I'm going to meet Allison. We're going to go shopping. Sorry.

622
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:47,220
没关系
No problem.

623
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,670
其实我认为你全搞错了
I think you're going about this whole thing all wrong.

624
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,770
女人需要听些甜言蜜语
Women... they like you to talk to them.

625
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:31,410
也许你该表现出温柔的那一面
Maybe it's just that you're not in touch with your feminine side.

626
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:33,610
因为我看“莎莉探讨时间”…
I was watching Sally Jessy Raphael...

627
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,910
算我多嘴
All right.

628
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:38,240
所有装备都在这，有遥感传送器
I got all the usual stuff here... a telemetry burst transmitter.

629
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:41,380
全球定位追踪器、监听器和供电器
I got a GPS tracker, an audio transmitter and a power supply.

630
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:45,550
全缝在皮包衬里下面，还有，哈瑞？
I've got it sewn into the lining here... Hey, Harry?

631
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:54,560
她来啦，小心
If you need to talk, speak into the purse.

632
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:56,560
她会开到我们前面去
Here she comes. She's gonna pop out right in front of us. Watch this.

633
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:57,720
宾果　　　对啊
Bingo.

634
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:04,510
她好像要去中国城
Looks like she's going into Chinatown.

635
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:09,910
她在停车
She's parking.

636
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,050
好了，现在用监听器
Okay, give me audio.

637
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:30,390
你确定没被跟踪？
You sure you weren't followed?

638
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:35,060
我照你教的不断往后看
No. I kept looking behind me like you taught me,

639
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:36,660
没见到有人跟踪
but I didn't see anyone.

640
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:39,100
很好，现在情况有点紧张
Okay, it's just that things are a bit hot right now.

641
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:43,500
一有状况，我就得马上离开
If I get a signal, I may have to leave suddenly.

642
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:45,110
我了解
I understand.

643
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:51,380
冒险是我的工作
Look, it's my job to take risks,

644
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,580
但你却不需要一起冒险
but not yours.

645
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:55,460
我不该拖你下水
I feel bad about bringing you into this,

646
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:57,460
但你是唯一能信任的人
but you're the only one I can trust.

647
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:00,960
你在执行任务吗？
Were you out on a mission?

648
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,470
这是秘密任务
We say "op," covert operation.

649
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:08,470
不过…比以前的要困难得多
And this one, well, got a little rough.

650
00:52:09,010 --> 00:52:10,010
比开罗的任务还困难？
Worse than Cairo?

651
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:11,100
开罗
Cairo.

652
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:15,070
比起来，开罗任务就像吃饭一样
Cairo was a day at the beach next to this.

653
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:17,410
这家伙可能是间谍
The guy's a spook.

654
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:18,950
替谁工作呢？
But for whom?

655
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,780
可能借着她来找到你
He could be working her to get to you.

656
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:24,950
- 你有没有看昨天的报纸  - 看了
- Did you read the papers yesterday? - Yes.

657
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:31,490
有时候它所报导的
Sometimes a story is a mask...

658
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:33,090
就是我的秘密任务
for a covert operation.

659
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,590
你有没有看到万豪酒店…
You see two men killed...

660
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:35,990
厕所内有两人被杀
in a restroom and two unidentified men...

661
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:37,130
还有两个身份不明的人…
in a running shootout,

662
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:38,200
在酒店内追逐的新闻？
ending at the Marriott?

663
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:40,230
那是你干的？
That was you?

664
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:41,830
不错，你真厉害
- Me. - You're very good.

665
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:43,160
居然看出我的手法来
You recognized my style.

666
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:45,440
你有这方面的天才
You're a natural at this.

667
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:47,200
这家伙是冒牌货
The guy's a fake.

668
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,500
居然冒充我们的案子
He's taking credit for our moves.

669
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:50,950
- 后来呢？  - 没什么好提的
- What happened? - Hardly worth talking about.

670
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,780
那两个已经挂了
Two of them won't bother me again.

671
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:56,110
真难以置信
Unbelievable.

672
00:52:56,450 --> 00:52:57,320
你在追另一个吗？
You chase done?

673
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,250
不错，不管多危险
Something came over me.

674
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,450
我一定要抓住他
I had to nail this guy no matter what the risk.

675
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:04,220
当时真惊险，有好几次被他…
Pretty hairy. I thought he had me a couple of times, but I...

676
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:06,660
其实我不该居功自傲的
I really can't take credit.

677
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:08,560
为什么？
Why not?

678
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,200
那全是训练的功劳
It's the training.

679
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:11,500
使我们变得很犀利
It shapes you into a lethal instrument.

680
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:13,570
这些都是反射动作，不需思考
You react in a microsecond without thinking.

681
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:16,160
我挺喜欢这家伙
I'm starting to like this guy.

682
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:19,460
当然仍要杀掉他，那是不可饶恕的
We still gotta kill him. That's a given, you know.

683
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:35,320
（旧车行）

684
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,670
这家伙居然是他妈的旧车推销员
The guy is a goddamned used car salesman.

685
00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:51,540
事情越来越精彩
This keeps getting better and better!

686
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:55,240
对不起，我知道你很痛苦
I'm sorry. I know this has gotta be painful.

687
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:56,810
但是，确实很有趣
But you gotta admit it's funny.

688
00:53:56,980 --> 00:54:00,750
如果换成别人，你也会笑破肚皮的
If it was just some idiot, not you...\nyou'd be laughing your ass off.

689
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:03,880
大鱼又要上钩了
One born every minute.

690
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:08,350
它也要你，你感觉到了吗？
It wants you too. Feel it vibrate?

691
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,520
- 要不要试试车？  - 好呀
- Say, how about a little spin? - Sure.

692
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:15,390
其实车代表你的形象
See, it's not just a car. It's a total image. An identity.

693
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:16,790
因此要有所选择
You have to go for it.

694
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:19,940
这并不是什么高科技的跑车
This isn't some high-tech sports car.

695
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:22,660
说真话，性能也不怎么样
To tell you the truth, it doesn't even handle that great.

696
00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:24,740
但那不是重点，对不对？
But that's not the idea, is it?

697
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,910
重要的是钓女人，是不是？
What are we talking about here? Pussy, right?

698
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:31,310
没错
Absolutely.

699
00:54:34,990 --> 00:54:38,180
大家都知道，这种车是女人的最爱
Let's face it. The 'Vette gets 'em wet.

700
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:40,860
但光靠车还不够
But it's not enough.

701
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:45,360
如果要成功，还得再加上点花招
If you really want to close escrow, you gotta have an angle.

702
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:48,020
那你一定有花招？
I suppose you have an angle.

703
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:49,390
百战百胜的绝招
It's killer.

704
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:53,100
我们都看得出来
I mean, look at me. I'm not that much to look at.

705
00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:55,300
我并不是什么帅哥
No, no, no. I can be honest.

706
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:57,370
却有一堆女人排着队等我
But I got 'em lining up,

707
00:54:57,470 --> 00:54:59,070
而且都很漂亮
and not just the skanks either.

708
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:00,400
当然也有丑的
Well, some are.

709
00:55:00,610 --> 00:55:02,140
你用什么绝招呢？
What's your angle?

710
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:05,740
抱歉，这是秘密
No, sorry. Trade secret.

711
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:08,820
你仔细想想看
Okay, just ask yourself:

712
00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:10,610
女人最想要什么？
What do women really want?

713
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:13,790
例如结婚多年的家庭主妇
You take these bored housewives married to the same guy for years.

714
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:15,200
生活淡得像白开水一样
They're stuck in a rut.

715
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:16,700
她们需要解放
They need some release.

716
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,660
希望过冒险和刺激的生活
The promise of adventure, a hint of danger.

717
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,360
我就替她们完成心愿
I create that for them.

718
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,190
所以基本上你是个大骗子
So basically you're lying your ass off the whole time.

719
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,560
我没办法做到
I couldn't do that.

720
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:27,500
拜托，又不是童子军
What are you, a Boy Scout?

721
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:30,040
就当在演戏一样，真的很棒
Think of it as playing a role. It's fantasy.

722
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:31,660
利用她们的梦想…
You gotta work on their dreams...

723
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:35,330
让她们每天有几个钟头的快乐时光
get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours.

724
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,010
那她们的先生怎么办呢？
What about their husbands?

725
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,050
管他的
Dickless!

726
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:40,950
老实说，如果他们不冷落太太…
I mean, let's face it. If they took care of business...

727
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:43,390
怎么会轮到我，你懂吧？
I'd be out of business, you know what I mean?

728
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:44,990
那些白痴们
Those idiots.

729
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:50,120
拜托别开得这么快
You mind keeping it under 90?

730
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:52,520
我牙医的钱还没付清呢
I'm still trying to pay for this dental work.

731
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:54,960
那么你现在的对象是谁？
So, who are you working on right now?

732
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,420
我随时都有好几个在手上
I always got a couple on the hook.

733
00:55:57,630 --> 00:56:01,040
但其中一个，已经在我掌握之中
There's this one right now, I got her panting like a dog.

734
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:02,300
真棒
It's great.

735
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:03,300
她是做什么的？
What does she do?

736
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:06,170
好像是秘书之类
Some sort of legal secretary or something.

737
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:08,640
就是那种又紧张、又保守的女人
You know, uptight and conservative.

738
00:56:09,010 --> 00:56:11,280
但如果点燃的话，她会比火还热
But she could be so hot if she wanted to be.

739
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:13,540
所以和你在一起，她就会燃烧起来
And with you, she gets to be real hot.

740
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:16,150
火辣辣的！真会被她溶化掉
Red hot! Her thighs steam.

741
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:17,940
她们就像垂死的植物
It's like a dying plant.

742
00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:19,140
只要一点水就会复苏
Just needs a little water.

743
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:20,380
真可怜，嫁给个没情调的笨蛋
Married to some boring jerk.

744
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:21,680
没情调的笨蛋？
Some boring jerk?

745
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:25,320
他不知道该好好珍惜她
He doesn't appreciate her.

746
00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:26,960
其实只要能点燃她
She's like all these babes.

747
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:28,760
就可以随心所欲了
You get their pilot lit, they can suck-start a leaf-blower.

748
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:33,390
她的身材真是一流，尤其是那双峰
She's got the most incredible body, and a pair of titties...

749
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:36,100
看得你直流口水
make you want to stand up and beg for buttermilk.

750
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,230
臀部又紧又翘
Ass like a ten-year-old boy.

751
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:48,310
那么床上功夫一定一流啦
So, then she must be really good in bed then, huh?

752
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:50,820
慢点，会来不及转弯
Slow down. You'll miss the turn.

753
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,070
你看…
See?

754
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:09,000
车子和你是绝配，狂野型的
You and this car were made for each other. Why fight it?

755
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:11,170
我有好几个客户喜欢这部车
Sure, I got a couple other buyers on the line,

756
00:57:11,290 --> 00:57:12,770
但你最适合
but I like your style.

757
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:14,710
你认为怎么样？
So, what do you say?

758
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:17,150
要不要买下来呀？
Should we start up the paperwork?

759
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:18,840
让我考虑一下
Let me think about it.

760
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:21,180
给我一天时间，好吗？
Hold it for me for a day, okay?

761
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:25,550
嘿，这可是看在你的份上
Hey, because it's you.

762
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,460
这是今天的记录
I got today's transcripts.

763
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:30,060
没什么事发生
Not much going on.

764
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:34,860
- 西蒙那边也没有？  - 没有
- Nothing from Simon? - No.

765
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:49,270
- 要我开吗？  - 把那一页给我
- My turn to drive? - Give me the page.

766
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:51,380
- 哪一页？  - 为何从9就跳到11
- What? - This jumped from page 9 to 11.

767
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:53,410
- 第10页呢？  - 一定是打错了
- Where's page 10? - It's gotta be a typo.

768
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:55,310
把第10页给我
Give me the goddam page!

769
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:01,050
好吧

770
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:06,290
你需要看心理医生
Seek help, Harry.

771
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:07,950
喂
Hello?

772
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:10,760
海伦，我需要你的帮助
Helen, I need your help.

773
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,160
今晚能见面吗？
Can you meet me tonight?

774
00:58:12,270 --> 00:58:13,930
- 发生了什么事？  - 很严重
- What's happened? - It's serious.

775
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:16,170
8点钟在K街的…
Meet me on K Street...

776
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:19,100
K桥下见面
under the Key Bridge, 8:00 sharp.

777
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:22,470
上钩了
Gotcha.

778
00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:25,780
糟糕，快8点了
Shit. It's almost 8:00.

779
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:35,120
她仍在家里
She's still at the house.

780
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:37,250
是皮包仍在家里
The purse is still at the house.

781
00:58:38,330 --> 00:58:38,890
该死
Shit.

782
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,160
第二组、第七组，注意听
Unit Two, Unit Seven, immediate roll.

783
00:58:43,370 --> 00:58:45,960
目标物在K街的K桥下
Acquire subject at K Street and Key Bridge.

784
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:48,000
开着红白相间的敞蓬车
Vehicle is red and white convertible.

785
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:49,590
你们只有6分钟
You got exactly six minutes.

786
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:52,300
等等，你疯了吗？
Wait a minute. Are you out of your mind?

787
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:54,510
你不能让别的案子调查员…
You can't pull agents off a priority surveillance...

788
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:56,010
来跟踪你太太
to follow your wife.

789
00:58:56,150 --> 00:58:59,980
那是滥用职权，并且违反国家安全
That's a misappropriation of resources and a breach of national security.

790
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:02,980
你听到了吗？你会惹上大麻烦
You copy? You're losing it big-time, man.

791
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:04,480
我必须制止你
I have to stop you.

792
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:05,920
你想去告密？
What are you gonna do, tell?

793
00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:08,790
这有关我们俩的前途
Look, goddam it. Both of our butts are on the line.

794
00:59:08,990 --> 00:59:12,290
我知道你太太和人约会，你很不爽
So your life's in the crapper. Your wife's banging a used car salesman.

795
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:13,900
觉得丢脸，我知道
It's humiliating, I know,

796
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:15,590
但你要像个男子汉面对事实
but take it like a man!

797
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:17,760
你告我，我就告你
You tell on me, I tell on you.

798
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:20,500
你是什么意思？我毫无瑕疵
What are you talking about?\nI'm as clean as a preacher's sheets.

799
00:59:20,870 --> 00:59:21,600
我干净得像…
I'm as clean as...

800
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:23,660
那次你为满足性欲…
What about when you blew a six-week operation...

801
00:59:23,770 --> 00:59:25,660
把任务搞砸，怎么说？
because you were busy getting a blow-job?

802
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:27,410
你知道那件事？
You knew about that?

803
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:32,580
走法兰克林街，比较快
Let's take Franklin. It's quicker.

804
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:02,510
快，上车，快点，我们走
Quick, get in. Hurry up. Let's go.

805
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:14,020
这是第二组，看到疑犯的车子
Two here. Suspect vehicle in sight.

806
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:16,090
一男、一女
One male, one female.

807
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:18,590
别紧张
Now, don't be alarmed.

808
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:21,460
你不能被他们看到
If I'm spotted, it'd be best if they didn't see you.

809
01:00:21,730 --> 01:00:24,170
所以在出城之前，最好把头放低
You should keep your head down till we're out of the city.

810
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,100
让我帮你
Here, let me help you.

811
01:00:30,470 --> 01:00:31,700
就是这样
That's better.

812
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:38,640
女人将她的头放在男人的腿上
Now the woman has her head in the guy's lap.

813
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:40,420
他们向K桥南方进行
South bound on the Key Bridge.

814
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:41,920
第二组继续跟踪
Two in pursuit.

815
01:00:41,950 --> 01:00:44,550
明白，第一组呼叫兀鹰号
Roger, Two. One to Condor,

816
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:45,850
看到疑犯吗？
you got a visual?

817
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:49,720
这是兀鹰号，看到了
Roger, One. This is Condor. Subject is in sight.

818
01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:51,690
重复，已看到目标物
Repeat. We have the ball.

819
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:54,360
用红外线看得很清楚
We got a pretty good lockup on infrared.

820
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:58,230
她是把头放在男人的腿上
She's got her head in the guy's lap, all right.

821
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:00,970
她可能想睡觉
Maybe she's sleepy.

822
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:07,800
这是间安全的房子
This is a safe house.

823
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:10,540
在市区的房子太危险
My place in the city is a little too hot right now.

824
01:01:10,950 --> 01:01:12,810
纽约的豪华套房也一样
So is the penthouse in New York.

825
01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:28,420
你到底要我帮什么？
What is it exactly you need me to do?

826
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:32,830
海伦，我要你做我太太
I want you to be my wife.

827
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:34,930
可是我已经结婚了
But I'm married!

828
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:37,740
这是为巴黎的任务做掩护
It's just for the operation in Paris.

829
01:01:37,870 --> 01:01:39,440
我需要个太太
I need to be married.

830
01:01:39,610 --> 01:01:41,540
因为他们在找单身旅行的人
They'll be looking for a man travelling alone.

831
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:44,610
你要我去巴黎？
You want me to go to Paris?

832
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,580
对，先停伦敦再到巴黎
Paris, with a quick stopover in London.

833
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:50,780
海伦

834
01:01:51,890 --> 01:01:54,480
组织中有个双重间谍，但不知是谁
There's a double agent in my outfit. I don't know who.

835
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:56,520
（美国航空公司 - 巴黎）

836
01:01:56,730 --> 01:01:58,960
除了你，我不相信任何人
There's no one I can trust, except you.

837
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:01,460
你能离开几天吗？
Can you get away, just for a couple of days?

838
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:03,360
我不知道
I just don't know.

839
01:02:03,530 --> 01:02:05,800
对不起，我不该催你
Of course. I'm rushing you. Forgive me.

840
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:08,500
坐下来，别拘束
Sit down. Make your self comfortable.

841
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:11,670
我再倒点酒给你
Let me pour you some more wine.

842
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:26,790
好的
I'll do it.

843
01:02:28,230 --> 01:02:30,920
我愿意帮你
I'll do it.

844
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:34,600
你真是救命恩人
You just saved my life.

845
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,530
而且非常勇敢
You are incredibly brave.

846
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:42,860
我必须提醒自己，你会有多么害怕
I have to remind myself of the fear you must be feeling.

847
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:45,300
只因为我没有害怕的权利
You see, for me fear is not an option.

848
01:02:46,410 --> 01:02:49,570
为了增加真实性…
Now, in order to pull this cover story off...

849
01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:53,710
我们必须看起来非常亲密
we have to look like two people who are completely intimate with each other.

850
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:56,510
否则会被敌人看穿
The enemy can spot a fake easily.

851
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:03,150
- 这就是我说的问题  - 对不起
- You see what I mean? - Sorry.

852
01:03:03,430 --> 01:03:04,990
这种反应会使我们丧命的
That reaction could get us both killed.

853
01:03:05,130 --> 01:03:06,990
- 对不起  - 这种事不能发生
- I'm sorry. - We can't afford that.

854
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,820
当然不行

855
01:03:09,030 --> 01:03:10,160
试着放松自己
Try to relax.

856
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,670
因为除了哈瑞…
It's just been a long time...

857
01:03:12,870 --> 01:03:15,670
已经很久没有别人那样碰我了
since anybody but Harry's touched me like that.

858
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:17,370
所以有点困难
It's a little difficult.

859
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:19,800
我知道，其实我也很笨拙
I know. It's awkward for me too.

860
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:20,600
抱歉
I'm sorry.

861
01:03:20,810 --> 01:03:24,010
- 没关系，向后靠一点  - 我很好
- That's all right. Just sit back. - I'm okay.

862
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,750
这样好多了
There. That's better.

863
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:31,680
让自己慢慢溶入角色里
Just let yourself slip into the role.

864
01:03:40,330 --> 01:03:41,320
就是这样
That's it.

865
01:03:43,230 --> 01:03:44,360
现在很好
There you go.

866
01:03:46,670 --> 01:03:48,000
放松自己
Just let yourself go.

867
01:03:50,070 --> 01:03:50,870
很好
That's good.

868
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:52,600
非常不错
That's great.

869
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:55,040
就是这样
That's it.

870
01:03:55,910 --> 01:03:57,900
不，我没办法
No, I can't do this. I can't do this.

871
01:03:58,050 --> 01:04:00,850
- 怎么回事？  - 我做不来
- What's wrong? It's okay. - I cannot do this.

872
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:02,420
真的没办法
I cannot do this!

873
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:08,520
就算不是为我
If not for me...

874
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:11,260
你也要为国家
do it for your country?

875
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,520
天哪，别伤害我
Oh, God! Don't hurt me!

876
01:04:43,730 --> 01:04:45,560
我会很听话的
I'll do whatever you want!

877
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:48,890
我什么也没做
Please! I didn't do anything!

878
01:04:58,110 --> 01:04:58,970
该死
Damn it!

879
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:24,260
带她走！天哪，别伤害我
Take her! Take her! Oh, God, don't hurt me!

880
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:31,100
真他妈的要命
Son of a bitch!

881
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:24,220
坐下来
Sit down.

882
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:28,100
我叫你坐下来
I said sit down.

883
01:06:33,870 --> 01:06:35,170
你替谁工作？
Who do you work for?

884
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:41,310
史坦、克斯勒、哥斯坦还有克普尼
Stern, Kessler, Goldstein & Krumpnick.

885
01:06:42,850 --> 01:06:45,010
我只是个秘书
I'm just a legal secretary.

886
01:06:45,150 --> 01:06:46,120
是吗？达斯克太太
Sure, Mrs. Tasker.

887
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,820
那你是替国际恐怖份子…
What were you doing with the international terrorist...

888
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:51,120
卡洛斯做速记吗？
Carlos the Jackal, taking dictation?

889
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:53,220
你加入他的党有多久？
How long have you been a member of his faction?

890
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:56,420
我根本不知道什么党
I don't know anything about a faction.

891
01:06:58,430 --> 01:07:00,690
我在两个礼拜前…
I just met Simon...

892
01:07:01,330 --> 01:07:03,130
遇到自称西蒙的他
or whoever you say he is...

893
01:07:03,330 --> 01:07:06,130
就是你们所说的那个人
just a couple weeks ago.

894
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:07,670
我对他一点也不清楚
I barely know him.

895
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:10,170
但当我们抵达时，你们似乎很亲密
That's not what it looked like when we found you.

896
01:07:12,410 --> 01:07:13,170
你怎么认识他的？
How did you meet him?

897
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:17,710
那是…
Well...

898
01:07:29,090 --> 01:07:31,720
请帮我看着公事包，我带着它太危险
Keep this for me. I can't afford to be taken with it.

899
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:34,490
- 什么？  - 这关系着国家安全
- What? - It's a matter of national security.

900
01:07:34,830 --> 01:07:38,560
求求你答应我，我会和你联络
Please, it's important. I'll contact you.

901
01:07:39,070 --> 01:07:40,130
糟糕
Oh, shit.

902
01:07:59,690 --> 01:08:01,120
（护照）

903
01:08:13,070 --> 01:08:14,660
你为什么要继续见他？
Why did you continue to see him?

904
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:17,370
他说需要我帮忙
He said he needed my help.

905
01:08:17,870 --> 01:08:20,210
不是因为他吸引了你？
Not because you were attracted to him?

906
01:08:21,010 --> 01:08:21,570
不是

907
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:24,810
你一点也不喜欢他？
You were not attracted to him at all?

908
01:08:31,790 --> 01:08:33,480
也许有一点
Well, maybe just a little.

909
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:36,430
你常做欺骗的事吗？
So, is cheating a common thing for you?

910
01:08:36,990 --> 01:08:37,790
从来没有
Never.

911
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:40,420
所以这是第一次？
So you're telling me this was your first time?

912
01:08:41,130 --> 01:08:42,790
我并没有欺骗
I wasn't cheating!

913
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:46,060
告诉我你先生的事
Tell me about your husband, Mrs. Tasker.

914
01:08:47,470 --> 01:08:48,440
你是指哈瑞？

915
01:08:53,010 --> 01:08:55,880
我该怎么说他呢？
What can I say about Harry?

916
01:08:56,950 --> 01:08:58,940
他是电脑公司的推销员
He's a sales rep for a computer company.

917
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:02,750
所以和他做爱，再也不能让你兴奋？
So sex with him isn't exactly waving your flag any more?

918
01:09:03,150 --> 01:09:06,750
这关你屁事，什么笨问题嘛！
That is none of your goddam business! What kind of questions are these?

919
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:09,620
你惹了很大的麻烦，最好合作点
You're in a lot of trouble, so I suggest you cooperate.

920
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:12,530
即使问到更私人的问题
If we want to know the most intimate details about your life...

921
01:09:12,630 --> 01:09:13,830
你也要回答
you'd better tell us.

922
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,430
我先生是个好人
My husband is a good man.

923
01:09:20,070 --> 01:09:22,160
但却不能让你心动，对不对？
But he's not exactly ringing your bell these days, is he?

924
01:09:23,170 --> 01:09:25,510
你不介意我来问这段吧？
Let me handle this part. Do you mind?

925
01:09:27,110 --> 01:09:29,340
为什么你去卡洛斯的藏身处？
Why did you go to Carlos' hideout?

926
01:09:29,980 --> 01:09:33,470
他要我假扮成他太太
He wanted me to go to Paris with him on a mission...

927
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,550
和他一起到巴黎去办案
to pose as his wife.

928
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:38,450
而你居然答应了？
And you agreed?

929
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:41,990
为什么？
Why?

930
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:45,150
不知道
I don't know.

931
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,090
我猜我需要一点证明
I guess I needed something.

932
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:51,930
什么样的证明？
What did you need?

933
01:09:58,710 --> 01:10:00,840
证明我仍活着
I needed to feel alive.

934
01:10:03,650 --> 01:10:06,880
我只想做点惊人之事
I just wanted to do something outrageous.

935
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:13,050
而且被人需要的感觉…
And it felt really good...

936
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:15,620
实在很好
to be needed.

937
01:10:20,330 --> 01:10:21,760
还有被人信任
And to be trusted.

938
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:26,690
和受到特别的待遇
And to be special.

939
01:10:28,910 --> 01:10:30,300
让我怎么说呢？
It's just that there's...

940
01:10:30,770 --> 01:10:32,970
在这一生中，我想做很多事
so much I wanted to do with this life...

941
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:35,440
却一样也没完成
and it's like I haven't done any of it.

942
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:38,710
而时间正在慢慢流失中
And the sand's running out of the hourglass...

943
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:41,350
我希望将来回顾时，能说…
and I wanted to be able to look back and say...

944
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,880
“这些我都做过”
"See? I did that!

945
01:10:44,050 --> 01:10:46,310
“我狂过、我野过”
I was reckless and I was wild and I fucking did it!"

946
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:48,190
“我他妈的全做过”
Quite frankly, I don't give a shit...

947
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:58,360
说实话，我根本不在乎你们懂不懂
whether you understand that or not.

948
01:11:01,170 --> 01:11:02,470
这个西蒙…
This Simon...

949
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:07,870
你和他上过床吗？
did you sleep with him?

950
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:10,170
没有
No.

951
01:11:10,810 --> 01:11:11,970
她在说谎
She's lying.

952
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:16,070
你没和他发生性行为？
You did not have sexual relations with him?

953
01:11:18,690 --> 01:11:21,820
你听着，如果每个问题你都问两次
Listen, if you're gonna ask me every question twice...

954
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:23,690
那要花掉很多时间
this is gonna take a really long time,

955
01:11:23,790 --> 01:11:25,890
而我还得赶着回家
and I have to get back to my family.

956
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:27,890
女士，你哪里也别想去
You're not going anywhere, lady.

957
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,890
让我离开这里！
Just let me out of here!

958
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:32,990
回答我的问题
Answer the question.

959
01:11:35,370 --> 01:11:36,500
快回答！
Answer the question!

960
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:40,930
没有！我…没有…
No! I did not...

961
01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:44,240
和他上床
sleep with him!

962
01:11:44,450 --> 01:11:45,310
请冷静下来
Calm down, please.

963
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:49,380
听到了吗？卑鄙的杂种！
You hear me, you chickenshit bastard?

964
01:11:49,590 --> 01:11:50,680
不要激动
Calm down.

965
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:52,540
她说的可能是实话
She could be telling the truth.

966
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:54,820
达斯克太太，别激动
Calm down, Mrs. Tasker.

967
01:11:56,990 --> 01:11:58,460
请你冷静下来
Calm down, please.

968
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:04,700
我只剩下一个问题了，达斯克太太
I've only one more question, Mrs. Tasker.

969
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:07,000
是什么？
What?

970
01:12:09,510 --> 01:12:13,000
你仍旧爱你的丈夫吗？
Do you still love your husband?

971
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:20,810
是的，我爱他
Yes, I love him.

972
01:12:22,550 --> 01:12:24,180
过去爱他
I've always loved him...

973
01:12:25,490 --> 01:12:27,620
将来也会永远爱他
and I will always love him.

974
01:12:33,230 --> 01:12:35,200
好啦，她爱你，现在怎么办？
She loves you. Now what?

975
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:40,980
达斯克太太

976
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:42,630
现在唯一解决的办法是…
There's only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.

977
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:44,770
你必须替我们工作
You must work for us.

978
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:49,080
你在搞什么鬼，哈瑞？
What are you doing?

979
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,710
我想给她个任务
Just giving her a little assignment.

980
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,250
你别开玩笑了！
You gotta be shitting me!

981
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:55,210
既然她想冒险，那就成全她
She wants a little adventure, so I'm gonna give her one.

982
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,580
我给你一个选择
I'm offering you a choice.

983
01:12:58,550 --> 01:13:00,850
如果替我们工作，那就不起诉
If you work for us, we will drop the charges...

984
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:03,120
而你能继续过着正常的生活
and you can go back to your normal life.

985
01:13:03,530 --> 01:13:06,390
如果不答应，就去坐牢
If not, you will go to a federal prison...

986
01:13:06,930 --> 01:13:10,870
这样将使你的先生和女儿受到羞辱
and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone.

987
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:13,070
而且你的一生将被毁掉
Your life will be destroyed.

988
01:13:17,210 --> 01:13:20,730
嗯…让我想想看
Gee. Let me think.

989
01:13:21,010 --> 01:13:22,840
好还是不好？
Yes or no?

990
01:13:23,450 --> 01:13:25,380
当然是好啦
Of course yes.

991
01:13:26,150 --> 01:13:27,450
要我做什么？
What's involved?

992
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:29,950
我们会用电话和你联络
You will be contacted with the assignment.

993
01:13:30,150 --> 01:13:33,450
联络的密码是波里斯
The code name of your contact will be Boris.

994
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:36,290
你的密码是…
Your code name will be...

995
01:13:37,030 --> 01:13:38,550
- 娜塔莎？  - 不是
- Natasha? - No.

996
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:41,490
桃乐丝
Doris.

997
01:13:53,410 --> 01:13:54,540
混球！
You son of a bitch.

998
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:06,290
卡洛斯，你这混蛋

999
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:08,290
你以为能躲一辈子吗？
Did you think you could elude us forever, Carlos?

1000
01:14:08,290 --> 01:14:10,730
等等，你们抓错人了，我叫西蒙
Wait! You got the wrong guy. My name's Simon.

1001
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:14,300
让我走，你们不必杀我
Just let me go. There's no need to kill me.

1002
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:16,430
因为我没看到你的脸…
I haven't seen your face...

1003
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:19,900
别脱！我没看见
Don't! I didn't see it! I didn't see it!

1004
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:24,570
是你！
It's you!

1005
01:14:24,970 --> 01:14:27,530
你仍然喜欢那部车吗？
Hey, you still interested in that 'Vette at all?

1006
01:14:27,740 --> 01:14:29,540
卡洛斯，别装蒜了
Hey, Carlos. The game's over.

1007
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:31,930
我们有文件证明你是国际恐怖份子
Your career as an international terrorist is well documented.

1008
01:14:31,950 --> 01:14:33,420
- 不是的！  - 是真的！
- No! - Oh, yeah!

1009
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:35,980
我只不过是个卖车的
I sell cars. That's all!

1010
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:38,920
真的不是什么恐怖份子
Come on. I'm not a terrorist.

1011
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:41,120
其实我胆子很小
I'm actually a complete coward.

1012
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:43,620
一看到枪，我就…天呀！
If I ever saw a gun I'd... Oh, God!

1013
01:14:43,690 --> 01:14:46,320
求求你们，别杀我
Oh, please, don't! Don't kill me!

1014
01:14:48,830 --> 01:14:50,590
我不是间谍
I'm not a spy.

1015
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:53,240
我什么都不是
I'm nothing!

1016
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:55,140
只是个小人物而已
I'm navel lint!

1017
01:14:56,510 --> 01:14:58,530
欺骗女人上床
I have to lie to women to get laid.

1018
01:14:58,670 --> 01:15:00,530
而且成功的机率很小
And I don't score much.

1019
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:03,340
都是因为小弟弟不够大
I got a little dick. It's pathetic.

1020
01:15:05,850 --> 01:15:07,870
喔，天啊！
Oh, God.

1021
01:15:09,350 --> 01:15:12,050
间谍会尿裤子吗？
Would a spy pee himself? Huh?

1022
01:15:15,390 --> 01:15:17,260
真的不值得杀我
Please, I'm not worth a bullet.

1023
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:19,320
请饶了我吧
Have mercy, sir.

1024
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:20,960
快滚吧
Get the fuck out of here.

1025
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:22,820
滚呀
Just beat it. Go on.

1026
01:15:24,130 --> 01:15:27,070
我知道，一转身你们就会杀我
As soon as I turn, you're gonna shoot me!

1027
01:15:27,370 --> 01:15:28,960
你们一定会杀我的
You're gonna shoot me!

1028
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:32,400
那部车我可以免费送你
Please! You can have the car for free.

1029
01:15:32,610 --> 01:15:34,010
请你放了我，好吗？
What do you say, huh?

1030
01:15:35,950 --> 01:15:37,470
滚吧，神经病
Get lost, dipshit.

1031
01:15:57,700 --> 01:16:00,030
昨晚是不是很刺激
So last night must've been pretty exciting for you.

1032
01:16:05,110 --> 01:16:06,440
我的车爆胎了
My flat tire?

1033
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:09,070
当时真的有点害怕
Actually, it was a little scary...

1034
01:16:09,380 --> 01:16:11,710
因为拖车司机弄了很久
because the tow truck driver took such a long time.

1035
01:16:19,090 --> 01:16:20,110
我去接
I'll get it.

1036
01:16:23,090 --> 01:16:24,020
喂
Hello?

1037
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:25,120
桃乐丝吗？
Doris?

1038
01:16:30,230 --> 01:16:31,360
是的
Yes?

1039
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:33,890
什么事？

1040
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:35,330
仔细听着
Listen carefully.

1041
01:16:35,770 --> 01:16:38,430
1小时内到马克斯酒店去
In exactly one hour, go to the Hotel Marquis.

1042
01:16:39,510 --> 01:16:42,340
向柜台要，给“桃乐丝”的信
Pick up an envelope marked "Doris" at the front desk...

1043
01:16:42,510 --> 01:16:44,640
- 还有，打扮得性感点  - 什么？
- and dress sexy. - What?

1044
01:16:45,820 --> 01:16:46,680
喂

1045
01:16:48,350 --> 01:16:50,550
不，不，转过去
No, no. Turn around.

1046
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:53,520
要温柔点
Do it doucement.

1047
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:56,790
要慢一点
Do it very slowly.

1048
01:16:57,260 --> 01:16:58,990
实在太低级了
You've reached a new all-time low.

1049
01:16:59,130 --> 01:17:01,320
真不敢相信，你居然去马克斯酒店
I can't believe you're crazy enough to use the suite at the Marquis.

1050
01:17:01,530 --> 01:17:04,360
你以为我负担得起吗？
Do you think I can afford a suite like this on my salary?

1051
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:06,000
到底录完了没有？
Is Jean-Claude done yet?

1052
01:17:06,170 --> 01:17:06,960
等一下
Hang on.

1053
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:10,000
真恐怖，是谁写的，哈瑞吗？
Who wrote this shit? Harry?

1054
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:13,640
快好了
It's going great.

1055
01:17:26,090 --> 01:17:29,020
有没有给桃乐丝的信吗？
Do you have an envelope for Doris?

1056
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:48,370
我是桃乐丝
This is Doris.

1057
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:52,180
你现在的身份是妓女，名叫米雪
Listen, you are a prostitute named Michelle.

1058
01:17:52,780 --> 01:17:55,550
在房间里，会有个男人等你
Go to the room. There will be a man there.

1059
01:17:56,050 --> 01:17:58,280
他是贩卖军火的疑犯
He is a suspected arms dealer.

1060
01:17:58,490 --> 01:17:59,920
等一等
Now, wait a minute.

1061
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:03,920
你不是…要我…那个吧？
You don't expect me to, uh, you know.

1062
01:18:04,390 --> 01:18:07,360
放心，他的嗜好很特殊
No. He has particular tastes.

1063
01:18:07,930 --> 01:18:09,490
只喜欢看
He likes to watch.

1064
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:15,140
告诉他原来的女孩卡拉生病了
Tell him that his regular girl, Carla, is sick.

1065
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:17,840
如果他喜欢你，会告诉你怎么做
If he likes you, he will tell you what to do.

1066
01:18:18,810 --> 01:18:20,040
在你离开之前…
You must plant the bug...

1067
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:23,540
必须把窃听器装在床边的电话上
near the telephone by the bed before you leave.

1068
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:26,440
如果任务没有完成…
If you do not complete your mission...

1069
01:18:26,620 --> 01:18:28,480
所有的约定全部取消
the deal is off.

1070
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:32,220
我快完蛋了
I'm gonna go to hell.

1071
01:20:29,870 --> 01:20:30,740
有人在吗？

1072
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:40,480
你好

1073
01:20:49,090 --> 01:20:50,580
请喝点香槟
Have some champagne.

1074
01:21:05,510 --> 01:21:06,070
到这里来
Come in here.

1075
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:28,360
我叫米雪
My name is Michelle.

1076
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:31,360
卡拉认为你会喜欢我
Carla thought you'd like me.

1077
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:33,830
由我来说话
Let me do the talking.

1078
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:37,470
你可以开始脱衣服了
You may start by unzipping your dress.

1079
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:43,030
不，不，转过去
No, no. Turn around.

1080
01:21:43,850 --> 01:21:47,710
要温柔点，要慢一点
Do it doucement. Do it very slowly.

1081
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:55,410
很好
Good.

1082
01:21:57,730 --> 01:22:00,220
请把衣服慢慢脱下来
Now slip the dress down slowly.

1083
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:13,330
好
Good.

1084
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:23,310
现在把丝袜一只一只的褪下去
Now slide your nylons off one by one.

1085
01:22:25,290 --> 01:22:26,580
我没穿丝袜
I'm not wearing any.

1086
01:22:27,220 --> 01:22:28,450
那很好
That's good.

1087
01:22:30,930 --> 01:22:33,330
现在，为我跳个舞
Now, dance for me.

1088
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:38,730
不是那样

1089
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:41,590
跳得性感点
Dance sexy.

1090
01:22:41,870 --> 01:22:44,110
让双手像情人的双手一样
Let your hands be your lover's hands

1091
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:46,640
爱抚着你的肌肤
on your own skin as you move.

1092
01:24:53,770 --> 01:24:57,140
请躺到床上，闭上眼睛
Now lie on the bed and close your eyes.

1093
01:25:03,250 --> 01:25:05,300
我以为你只喜欢看
I thought you only liked to watch.

1094
01:25:11,150 --> 01:25:14,520
请躺到床上，闭上眼睛
Now lie on the bed and close your eyes.

1095
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:40,070
你这只猪！
You pig!

1096
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:42,870
混蛋
Bastard!

1097
01:26:53,860 --> 01:26:55,520
海伦，等一等
Wait, wait, wait.

1098
01:27:00,260 --> 01:27:00,960
哈瑞？
Yes, it's Harry.

1099
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:06,300
是我，看起来很奇怪，但我能解释
I know it looks bad, but I can explain.

1100
01:27:08,740 --> 01:27:09,970
大家都别动
Nobody move!

1101
01:27:10,670 --> 01:27:12,970
不准动
Don't move!

1102
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:16,640
海伦，听他们的话
Helen, just don't do anything.

1103
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:20,150
他和此事无关，我是你们要的人
No, he has nothing to do with it! I'm the one you want!

1104
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:21,340
闭嘴
Shut up!

1105
01:27:21,550 --> 01:27:23,210
海伦，不要说话，照他们的话去做
Quiet, Helen. Do what they say.

1106
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:29,290
让这个妓女走吧，她根本不重要
Come on, guys, let the hooker go. She's not important.

1107
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:30,890
你们不需要她
You don't need her.

1108
01:27:31,090 --> 01:27:33,650
哈瑞，让我来处理这件事
Harry, please, just let me handle this.

1109
01:27:33,830 --> 01:27:34,800
闭嘴！
Shut up!

1110
01:27:37,330 --> 01:27:39,460
你到那里干什么？
What were you doing there?

1111
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:40,970
告诉你，你也不相信
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

1112
01:27:41,140 --> 01:27:42,800
再说话，就杀了你们
Talk again and I'll kill you!

1113
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:22,770
哈瑞

1114
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:26,410
若我说“很高兴见到你”那是骗人
I wish I could say it's nice to see you again.

1115
01:28:26,980 --> 01:28:28,040
你认识她？
You know her?

1116
01:28:30,350 --> 01:28:33,550
这种口红的颜色，一点也不适合你
You know, this shade's totally wrong for you.

1117
01:28:34,290 --> 01:28:35,850
你那朋友是谁？
So who's your little friend?

1118
01:28:36,660 --> 01:28:37,920
我叫海伦・达斯克
I'm Helen Tasker.

1119
01:28:38,060 --> 01:28:40,320
他是我丈夫，你是谁？
Harry is my husband. And you are?

1120
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:41,750
这么说，你真是达斯克
So now it's Tasker,

1121
01:28:41,860 --> 01:28:43,400
而不是伦奎斯特
not Renquist.

1122
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:47,770
她只不过是我在酒吧认识的妓女
She's just some wacko hooker I met down at the bar.

1123
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:52,040
哈瑞，你是怎么搞的？说实话呀
What is the matter with you? Just tell her the truth!

1124
01:28:52,210 --> 01:28:54,330
我们已经结婚，还有一个女儿
We are married, and we have a daughter.

1125
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:56,870
我不认识这个疯女人
I don't know what the crazy bitch is on.

1126
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:59,710
最好先放掉她，我们好能办正事
You should cut her loose so we can get down to business.

1127
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:02,880
那我怎么会有这张照片呢？
Where did I get this then, huh?

1128
01:29:03,050 --> 01:29:04,520
我到哪弄来的？
Where did I get this?

1129
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:13,990
在起飞前想要点什么？
Something before takeoff?

1130
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,860
很痛的，你这个…
That hurt, you b...

1131
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:24,470
看来她说的是实话
She was telling the truth, wasn't she?

1132
01:29:25,070 --> 01:29:26,900
她真的什么也不知道
She really doesn't know.

1133
01:29:29,910 --> 01:29:31,380
实在有趣
How interesting.

1134
01:30:21,530 --> 01:30:22,120
把他们带进来
Bring them.

1135
01:30:30,610 --> 01:30:32,300
很宏伟，是不是？
Incredible, aren't they?

1136
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:36,540
我叫它们为四骑师
I call them the Four Horsemen.

1137
01:30:37,350 --> 01:30:38,870
它们代表勇士
They're warrior figures...

1138
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:42,950
是属于波斯帝国大流士的
from the Persian Empire of Darius l...

1139
01:30:44,050 --> 01:30:45,990
大约是在公元前500年
around 500 BC.

1140
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:50,620
而且是无价之宝
They're absolutely priceless.

1141
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:53,730
真可惜
Pity.

1142
01:31:16,790 --> 01:31:17,910
等等！
Wait, wait!

1143
01:31:20,260 --> 01:31:21,280
打开它
Open it.

1144
01:31:51,490 --> 01:31:52,980
你知道这是什么吗？
Do you know what this is?

1145
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:57,050
我当然知道
I know what this is.

1146
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:02,260
是蒸气式咖啡机
This is an espresso machine.

1147
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:08,860
不对，应该是雪绵制冰机
It's a snow cone maker. That's what it is.

1148
01:32:13,940 --> 01:32:15,240
难道是热水炉吗？
Is it a water heater?

1149
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:20,450
你知道为什么会带你来这吗？
Do you know why you've been brought here?

1150
01:32:21,450 --> 01:32:23,920
因为我们要他向世界宣布…
So that this man can verify to the world...

1151
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:27,150
红伐党已经拥有了核武器
the Crimson Jihad is now a nuclear power.

1152
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:32,920
天呀！他只不过是个推销员罢了
How can he do that? He's just a salesman, for Christ's sake.

1153
01:32:37,730 --> 01:32:41,330
如果我错了，那你的鲜血…
If I'm wrong about him, the last thing you'll see...

1154
01:32:41,570 --> 01:32:44,130
将会喷满他的脸
will be your blood spraying across his face.

1155
01:32:50,780 --> 01:32:52,340
它是多重独立导向…
It's a Soviet MIRV-6 from

1156
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:54,840
俄式空中核弹火箭
an SS-22 air launch vehicle.

1157
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:58,780
而这种弹头之中还包含了…
The warhead contains

1158
01:32:58,950 --> 01:33:00,680
14.5公斤的强化铀和z
14.5 kilograms of enriched uranium and a plutonium trigger.

1159
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:02,820
相当于3万吨的核能量
The nominal yield is 30 kilotons.

1160
01:33:03,930 --> 01:33:05,920
释放她，我就合作

1161
01:33:17,610 --> 01:33:20,910
该怎么说呢，我是个间谍
What can I say? I'm a spy.

1162
01:33:29,380 --> 01:33:32,650
你这个混蛋、骗子、狗娘养的！
You bastard! You lying son of a bitch!

1163
01:33:33,390 --> 01:33:35,910
- 甜心  - 对不起，别叫我甜心
- Sorry, honey. - Don't you call me honey!

1164
01:33:36,090 --> 01:33:38,080
永远别想再叫我甜心
You don't ever get to call me honey again!

1165
01:33:38,290 --> 01:33:40,280
听到了吗？你这只猪！
You understand me, you pig?

1166
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:43,560
我可以证明他们有核弹头的控制器
And I can verify that they have the arming box...

1167
01:33:44,170 --> 01:33:46,330
以及引爆核弹头…
and all the equipment necessary...

1168
01:33:46,570 --> 01:33:48,870
所需要的其它装备
to detonate all four warheads.

1169
01:33:58,110 --> 01:34:01,670
你们杀了我们的妇女和小孩
You have killed our women and our children...

1170
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:03,420
像懦夫一般…
bombed our cities...

1171
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:05,320
从远处轰炸我们的城市
from afar like cowards...

1172
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:08,150
还居然敢说我们是恐怖份子
and you dare to call us terrorists?

1173
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:13,520
如今，被压迫的我们终于有力量…
Now the oppressed have been given a mighty sword...

1174
01:34:13,660 --> 01:34:16,300
向敌人反击了
with which to strike back at their enemies.

1175
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:16,300
（电池将用尽）

1176
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:18,000
除非你们美国人…
Unless you, America...

1177
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:20,100
马上将军事力量…
pulls all military forces...

1178
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:22,560
从波斯湾撤出，并且永不再来
out of the Persian Gulf area immediately and forever...

1179
01:34:24,910 --> 01:34:26,500
否则每星期红伐党…
the Crimson Jihad will rain fire...

1180
01:34:26,710 --> 01:34:29,580
将血洗一个美国主要城市…
on one major U.S. city each week...

1181
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:32,050
直到你们退出为止
until our demands are met.

1182
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:34,910
首先，在这个无人小岛上…
First, we will detonate one weapon...

1183
01:34:35,050 --> 01:34:36,550
引爆一枚炸弹
on this uninhabited island...

1184
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:39,590
好证明我们的实力
as a demonstration of our power...

1185
01:34:39,790 --> 01:34:43,950
红伐党是支持人道主义的
and Crimson Jihad's willingness to be humanitarian.

1186
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:47,490
但是，如果你们不撤军
However, if these demands are not met...

1187
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:50,250
那我们只好每星期…
Crimson Jihad will rain fire...

1188
01:34:50,470 --> 01:34:53,900
血洗一个美国主要城市
on one major American city each week

1189
01:34:56,970 --> 01:34:57,960
电池用完了
Battery.

1190
01:35:05,310 --> 01:35:07,540
白痴，去换一个呀
Get another one, you moron.

1191
01:35:07,720 --> 01:35:11,170
卡车里…好像还有一个
I think I have one in the truck.

1192
01:35:13,660 --> 01:35:15,120
- 干什么？  - 快来看
- What? - Look at this.

1193
01:35:16,990 --> 01:35:18,220
那不是我的
That's not mine.

1194
01:35:18,390 --> 01:35:19,950
很棒的传送器
Nice transmitter.

1195
01:35:22,300 --> 01:35:23,320
迈阿密塔台
Miami Tower,

1196
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:25,320
6479号喷射机准备进入跑道
Jet Star 6479 Delta on final.

1197
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:27,530
- 预计12分钟后着陆  - 好
- We'll be on the ground in 12 minutes. - All right.

1198
01:35:28,070 --> 01:35:30,620
让毒品稽查员准备好直升机
Tell those D.E.A. boys to have the helos...

1199
01:35:30,770 --> 01:35:32,100
12分钟后起飞
hot and ready to fly in 12 minutes.

1200
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:36,110
讯号停在佛罗里达州的启思岛
Signal's definitely stopped moving. It's an island in the Keys.

1201
01:35:41,420 --> 01:35:42,680
讯号消失了
We lost the signal.

1202
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:43,650
糟糕
Shit!

1203
01:36:02,740 --> 01:36:05,370
各位，这位就是萨米亚
All right, everyone. This is Samir.

1204
01:36:07,180 --> 01:36:10,370
谁能猜出他的专长，就得50分
For 50 points, see if you can guess his specialty.

1205
01:36:10,950 --> 01:36:11,740
口腔卫生吗？
No hygiene?

1206
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:14,510
不完全对
Not exactly.

1207
01:36:15,350 --> 01:36:16,780
哈瑞，这到底在搞什么？
What's going on?

1208
01:36:17,090 --> 01:36:19,580
萨米亚只想问哈瑞几个问题
Samir's just gonna ask Harry a few questions.

1209
01:36:19,790 --> 01:36:23,050
我们想知道哈瑞是替谁工作？
We're not even sure which agency Harry works for.

1210
01:36:23,290 --> 01:36:25,380
而萨米亚是问询这方面的高手
Now, Samir's absolutely first-class.

1211
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:29,220
当然，哈瑞在这方面也很不赖
On the other hand we have Harry,

1212
01:36:29,430 --> 01:36:30,760
居然能欺骗他所爱的女人…
who's managed to lie convincingly...

1213
01:36:30,830 --> 01:36:32,060
达15年之久
to the woman he loves for 15 years.

1214
01:36:32,370 --> 01:36:34,800
所以我对他到底能抵抗多久
So it'll be interesting to see...

1215
01:36:34,970 --> 01:36:36,200
很感兴趣
how long he can resist.

1216
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:37,890
这个会有所帮助
This will help.

1217
01:36:39,770 --> 01:36:42,000
你应该先用酒精消毒的
You know, you should swab that with alcohol.

1218
01:36:43,140 --> 01:36:44,810
否则我可能会被感染
I might get an infection.

1219
01:36:46,310 --> 01:36:49,180
等药力开始时，我会回来
I'll return when this has taken effect.

1220
01:36:49,980 --> 01:36:51,040
那时候，我们再谈
Then we'll talk.

1221
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:54,350
我衷心盼望
I'm looking forward to it.

1222
01:36:55,090 --> 01:36:57,250
你为什么要帮助那些疯子
Now, why are you helping these raving psychotics?

1223
01:36:58,090 --> 01:37:01,360
因为他们有雄厚的资金
Because they're very well-funded raving psychotics...

1224
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:03,730
而且给了我不少的钱
and I'm getting a lot of money.

1225
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:09,100
我才不关心他们的理念
What, you think I care about their cause?

1226
01:37:09,700 --> 01:37:12,870
当然也不在乎你的死活
Or yours? Not at all.

1227
01:37:14,540 --> 01:37:16,170
你的脑袋有问题，女士
You're damaged goods, lady.

1228
01:37:23,890 --> 01:37:25,350
你把我们俩的事情告诉她了吗？
Did you tell her about us?

1229
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:28,350
你这疯婆娘，我们之间根本没什么
There is no "us," you psychopathic bitch.

1230
01:37:29,020 --> 01:37:30,720
哦，是吗？
Oh, sure.

1231
01:37:31,490 --> 01:37:33,220
你现在当然会这么说
You say that now.

1232
01:37:38,430 --> 01:37:41,960
谢谢你给我那段快乐的时光
Thanks for everything. It wasn't bad while it lasted.

1233
01:37:43,070 --> 01:37:44,040
我们走
Let's go.

1234
01:37:45,310 --> 01:37:46,240
你们俩留下来
You two stay here.

1235
01:37:52,710 --> 01:37:53,910
我们之间没什么
There was nothing.

1236
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:57,210
我发誓
I swear.

1237
01:38:20,110 --> 01:38:22,300
他给你打了什么针？
What did they give you?

1238
01:38:25,810 --> 01:38:29,040
一种说实话的麻醉药
Sodium Amytal, or some other truth agent.

1239
01:38:30,450 --> 01:38:31,920
它真会让你说实话吗？
It makes you tell the truth?

1240
01:38:36,460 --> 01:38:37,580
药力开始了吗？
Is it working?

1241
01:38:38,990 --> 01:38:41,830
问一个通常我会说谎的问题
Ask me a question that I normally would lie to.

1242
01:38:44,130 --> 01:38:45,430
我们会死吗？
Are we gonna die?

1243
01:38:46,270 --> 01:38:46,960
会
Yep.

1244
01:38:48,140 --> 01:38:49,400
看来已经开始了
I'd say it's working.

1245
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:51,570
他们会在我们头上开一枪
They're gonna shoot us in the head,

1246
01:38:51,570 --> 01:38:53,570
不然就折磨我们到死
or they're gonna torture us to death...

1247
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:55,470
否则就把我们留在这里，让炸弹…
or they're gonna leave us here and let the bomb...

1248
01:38:55,740 --> 01:38:56,610
哈瑞！

1249
01:39:01,980 --> 01:39:05,440
你做了多久的间谍？
How long have you been a spy?

1250
01:39:09,290 --> 01:39:10,690
17年
Seventeen years.

1251
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:25,060
有没有杀过人？
Have you ever killed anyone?

1252
01:39:27,940 --> 01:39:29,740
有，但是他们都是坏人
Yeah, but they were all bad.

1253
01:40:00,310 --> 01:40:05,140
在开始之前，你有事要告诉我吗？
Is there anything you want to tell me before we start?

1254
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:06,610
有
Yeah.

1255
01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:09,370
我很快就要杀死你们
I'm going to kill you pretty soon.

1256
01:40:09,850 --> 01:40:11,080
我知道了
I see.

1257
01:40:12,950 --> 01:40:14,080
怎么杀呢？
How, exactly?

1258
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:19,050
首先，我把你当做肉墙
First, I'm going to use you as a human shield.

1259
01:40:20,330 --> 01:40:22,890
然后用桌上的套管针
Then I'm going to kill this guard over there...

1260
01:40:23,050 --> 01:40:25,490
把那边的守卫杀掉
with the Patterson trocar on the table.

1261
01:40:26,630 --> 01:40:29,630
最后再把你的脖子扭断
And then I was thinking about breaking your neck.

1262
01:40:31,270 --> 01:40:33,670
你认为能成功吗？
And what makes you think you can do all that?

1263
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:35,870
你记得那副手铐吗？
You know my handcuffs?

1264
01:40:37,810 --> 01:40:39,010
我撬开了
I picked them.

1265
01:41:03,170 --> 01:41:04,140
我们快离开这里
Let's get out of here.

1266
01:41:54,720 --> 01:41:55,550
咱们走！
Come on!

1267
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:36,650
哈瑞！

1268
01:42:38,270 --> 01:42:39,230
把枪放下
Drop the gun!

1269
01:42:47,070 --> 01:42:50,040
甜心，下次记得先低头
Honey, next time, duck.

1270
01:42:55,720 --> 01:42:56,520
我们走
Let's go.

1271
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:58,300
我居然嫁给了肌肉男兰博
I married Rambo.

1272
01:43:24,650 --> 01:43:25,840
他们在做什么？
What are they doing?

1273
01:43:50,040 --> 01:43:51,200
时间已定下
It is done.

1274
01:43:54,510 --> 01:43:58,210
在90分钟内，一柱圣火
In 90 minutes, a pillar of holy fire...

1275
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:00,450
将会点燃天空
will light up the skies...

1276
01:44:03,850 --> 01:44:05,480
好让全世界的人知道
to show to the world...

1277
01:44:06,650 --> 01:44:08,750
我们讲的是实话
that we speak the truth.

1278
01:44:24,010 --> 01:44:26,670
我们的意志坚定
We are set on our course.

1279
01:44:27,410 --> 01:44:29,070
没人能阻挡我们
No force can stop us now.

1280
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:32,040
我们很冷静，随时准备牺牲等等
We're cool, we're bad-asses, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1281
01:44:32,580 --> 01:44:34,880
若是在岛上，那他们为何用卡车？
If we're on an island, why are they using trucks?

1282
01:44:35,620 --> 01:44:38,110
那我们一定是在佛州的启思岛上
We must be in the Florida Keys.

1283
01:44:38,120 --> 01:44:40,680
跨海大桥将岛和本土连结起来
The overseas highway connects the islands to the mainland.

1284
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:43,720
这里没有国界、也没海关
There's no borders, no customs.

1285
01:44:43,990 --> 01:44:45,660
能长驱直入美国
They can go anywhere in the U.S.

1286
01:44:45,790 --> 01:44:47,260
根本阻挡不了他们
There's nothing to stop them.

1287
01:44:48,430 --> 01:44:49,490
除了我们
Just us.

1288
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,760
把枪拿着
Here, take this.

1289
01:44:53,940 --> 01:44:54,900
噢，要命
Oh, shit.

1290
01:46:20,920 --> 01:46:22,050
开枪
Shoot!

1291
01:46:38,570 --> 01:46:39,730
糟糕
Shit!

1292
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:53,740
没子弹了

1293
01:48:31,720 --> 01:48:32,520
该死

1294
01:49:10,820 --> 01:49:11,620
好的！

1295
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:40,740
我们走
Let's go.

1296
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:50,260
唉！让我向寡妇致哀吧
My condolences to the widow.

1297
01:50:07,410 --> 01:50:09,250
我们可能需要人质
We may need the hostage.

1298
01:50:12,220 --> 01:50:14,550
可怜的绝望主妇，走吧
Okay, let's go, Suzy Homemaker.

1299
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:22,850
快点
Hurry up!

1300
01:50:23,060 --> 01:50:24,930
把她押到车里，我们出发吧
Just get her in the car. Let's get going.

1301
01:51:36,300 --> 01:51:37,770
我就知道，这是你的功劳
I thought this looked like your work.

1302
01:51:37,910 --> 01:51:39,570
快走，在飞机上做简报
Let's go. I'll brief you in the air.

1303
01:51:40,970 --> 01:51:44,100
别客气，我们走吧！快走
You're welcome. Let's go! Let's get out of here!

1304
01:51:44,350 --> 01:51:46,310
我们快走
Let's go! Come on!

1305
01:52:09,370 --> 01:52:12,500
请你告诉那个笨蛋，这是紧急情况
Well, you tell that son of a bitch this is a Bright Boy Alert.

1306
01:52:12,970 --> 01:52:15,130
重复：紧急情况
I repeat: A Bright Boy Alert.

1307
01:52:15,340 --> 01:52:17,570
现在不是演习，你懂吗？
This is not a drill. Do you understand that?

1308
01:52:17,750 --> 01:52:20,410
等一下，请替我接白宫
Hold on. Put me through to the White House.

1309
01:52:20,580 --> 01:52:23,280
将所有人撤出12哩外
The minimum safe distance is 12 miles.

1310
01:52:23,420 --> 01:52:24,880
马上叫海军陆战队…
Get the marine patrol in right away.

1311
01:52:25,050 --> 01:52:27,320
海岸警卫队、警察部队去帮忙
I want the Coast Guard and the sheriff's department too.

1312
01:52:27,490 --> 01:52:31,080
任何无法撤出的人，就用飞机运送
Anyone that cannot make that distance, you gotta get 'em out by air.

1313
01:52:31,290 --> 01:52:33,590
好了，你们只有34分钟
You've got exactly 34 minutes.

1314
01:52:33,960 --> 01:52:36,120
有两架侵略者号战斗机…
I can get you two Marine Corps Harriers here...

1315
01:52:36,180 --> 01:52:37,520
将在11分钟内抵达
in 11 minutes.

1316
01:52:37,530 --> 01:52:39,590
他们现在在启思岛的西方
They're on manoeuvres outside Key West.

1317
01:52:39,770 --> 01:52:41,500
让他们来，我会做简报
Get them. I'll brief them on the way in.

1318
01:52:41,670 --> 01:52:42,660
请他们马上来
Send 'em in right away.

1319
01:52:54,680 --> 01:52:55,610
要来一杯吗？
Would you like one?

1320
01:53:03,060 --> 01:53:04,540
要州警用麦克风…
I want the state police driving through the streets...

1321
01:53:04,640 --> 01:53:06,390
在街头通知所有居民
on their damn loudspeakers.

1322
01:53:06,590 --> 01:53:07,990
他们来了
Here they come.

1323
01:53:18,610 --> 01:53:20,000
这是莱姆01号
Lime-Zero-One,

1324
01:53:20,110 --> 01:53:22,040
在桥的东方看到三辆卡车
got a tally on three trucks east bound on the bridge.

1325
01:53:22,410 --> 01:53:24,840
知道了，莱姆01号，他们是你的了
Roger, Lime-Zero-One. You're clear to engage.

1326
01:53:25,080 --> 01:53:27,440
导弹会绕圈子，先用机关枪攻击
Ringo is padlocked. In hot with guns.

1327
01:53:28,450 --> 01:53:29,680
我们开始进攻
Let's get some.

1328
01:54:34,010 --> 01:54:36,000
陆战队员们，去踢他们的屁股吧
Okay, marines, time to kick ass.

1329
01:54:36,020 --> 01:54:38,800
我建议，用精确致导导弹把桥炸断
Recommend using your Mavericks to take out the bridge.

1330
01:54:38,820 --> 01:54:39,810
知道了
Roger that.

1331
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:42,710
莱姆战机启动两枚精确致导导弹
Lime flight, switch Mavericks. Two.

1332
01:54:42,820 --> 01:54:44,810
它们不会引爆核弹头吧？
These missiles won't set off those nukes, will they?

1333
01:54:45,060 --> 01:54:47,790
不会的，莱姆01号
That's a negative.

1334
01:54:50,500 --> 01:54:51,520
发射
Fire.

1335
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:15,190
- 宾果  - 射得好，海军陆战队
- Bingo! - Good shooting, marines.

1336
01:56:07,370 --> 01:56:08,000
我要杀了你
I'll kill you!

1337
01:56:26,760 --> 01:56:28,850
- 车失控了  - 好像有人杀了司机
- It's out of control. - Somebody capped the driver.

1338
01:56:36,740 --> 01:56:37,700
泼妇
Bitch!

1339
01:57:08,340 --> 01:57:10,830
一瓶够吗？干脆来两瓶
Like one? How about two?

1340
01:57:37,930 --> 01:57:39,260
低飞，向轿车接近
Get down to the limo!

1341
01:57:42,400 --> 01:57:45,270
低飞，快！
Come on! Take it down! Let's go!

1342
01:57:46,540 --> 01:57:47,400
再低点
Get down!

1343
01:57:47,610 --> 01:57:49,370
还要低
Take it down.

1344
01:57:56,280 --> 01:57:57,150
哈瑞，是你吗？

1345
01:57:58,290 --> 01:57:58,910
哈瑞！

1346
01:57:59,090 --> 01:58:00,780
桥断了
The bridge is out!

1347
01:58:01,150 --> 01:58:01,780
什么？
What?

1348
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:04,960
桥断了
The bridge is out!

1349
01:58:05,530 --> 01:58:07,050
我听不到
I can't hear you!

1350
01:58:07,530 --> 01:58:08,650
你说什么？
What?

1351
01:58:11,770 --> 01:58:14,600
喔，天呀！桥断了
Oh, God! The bridge is out!

1352
01:58:14,870 --> 01:58:17,300
哈瑞，桥断了

1353
01:58:17,540 --> 01:58:19,530
快，快点呀！
Come on! Come on!

1354
01:58:20,010 --> 01:58:22,070
加点速，在这里低飞
Speed up a little bit, now. Get down there.

1355
01:58:30,680 --> 01:58:32,150
哈瑞，快点嘛！
Come on! Hurry!

1356
01:58:32,550 --> 01:58:33,850
快，拜托快一点
Hurry, Harry!

1357
01:58:35,020 --> 01:58:37,550
- 抓住我的手  - 你回来呀！
- Grab my hand! - Come back!

1358
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:39,450
向右一点
Okay, to the right.

1359
01:58:39,630 --> 01:58:41,320
我够不着，再低一点
I can't reach! Get lower!

1360
01:58:51,510 --> 01:58:53,770
好了，抓紧
Here we go! Hold on!

1361
01:58:54,040 --> 01:58:55,170
抓紧点
Hold on really tight!

1362
01:58:57,940 --> 01:58:59,240
哈瑞！
Harry!

1363
01:58:59,850 --> 01:59:02,640
你快回来！
Come back!

1364
01:59:02,850 --> 01:59:04,250
向上一点
Pull up!

1365
01:59:07,490 --> 01:59:09,610
抓住我的手
Grab my hand!

1366
01:59:09,820 --> 01:59:12,090
- 试试看  - 我够不着
- You can do it!\n- I can't reach!

1367
01:59:13,830 --> 01:59:16,690
天呀，哈瑞，快想办法！
Oh, God! Please! Harry!

1368
01:59:20,700 --> 01:59:22,290
完了
Oh, shit.

1369
01:59:23,870 --> 01:59:24,600
加油，宝贝
Come on, baby.

1370
01:59:33,250 --> 01:59:34,540
抓紧
Hold on!

1371
01:59:34,780 --> 01:59:36,110
别担心，我抓住你了
I got you!

1372
01:59:36,280 --> 01:59:38,220
哇，我的天！
Oh, God!

1373
01:59:38,420 --> 01:59:39,510
抓紧点
Hold on tight!

1374
01:59:39,690 --> 01:59:41,240
哈瑞！

1375
02:00:03,810 --> 02:00:06,540
（公路中间严禁停车）

1376
02:00:13,090 --> 02:00:14,680
我们快降落
Let's get this thing on the ground.

1377
02:00:24,900 --> 02:00:26,920
所有的飞机快着陆
Let's get these aircraft on the ground.

1378
02:00:27,100 --> 02:00:29,730
核弹大约1分钟后就会爆炸
We got a nuclear bomb going off in about one minute.

1379
02:00:34,370 --> 02:00:36,540
任何时间都会爆炸
Any minute now. Go, go, go.

1380
02:00:37,580 --> 02:00:39,200
快给我扩音器
Come here. Give me a bullhorn.

1381
02:00:42,020 --> 02:00:43,240
好了，现在是“表演”时间
All right, it's show time.

1382
02:00:43,650 --> 02:00:46,180
不要注视闪光
Do not look at the flash. Do not look at the flash!

1383
02:00:47,990 --> 02:00:49,550
这里应该很安全
We should be safe here.

1384
02:00:59,030 --> 02:01:00,760
你怎么能戴错手指呢？
This is the wrong finger.

1385
02:01:38,940 --> 02:01:40,000
哈瑞

1386
02:01:40,310 --> 02:01:41,600
哈瑞，来这里一下
Come here!

1387
02:01:42,810 --> 02:01:44,740
- 去办事吧  - 好，拜拜
- Go to work. - Okay. Bye.

1388
02:01:47,250 --> 02:01:49,520
阿兹的直升机20分钟前…
Aziz's copter landed about 20 minutes ago

1389
02:01:49,650 --> 02:01:51,520
降落在迈阿密大厦上
on top of a high-rise in Miami.

1390
02:01:51,580 --> 02:01:54,820
他和他的党员聚集在20楼
He rendezvoused with some faction members. They're on the 20th floor.

1391
02:01:54,990 --> 02:01:57,490
反恐特警已到达，警察封锁了现场
I got SWAT down there. The cops cordoned off the area.

1392
02:01:58,590 --> 02:02:00,720
他们所握有的人质，是达娜
They got a hostage. It's Dana.

1393
02:02:02,760 --> 02:02:04,960
你什么意思？我女儿达娜？
What do you mean? My Dana?

1394
02:02:05,430 --> 02:02:06,130
是的，哈瑞

1395
02:02:06,180 --> 02:02:07,230
真抱歉我不知该说什么
I'm real sorry. I don't know what to say.

1396
02:02:07,300 --> 02:02:09,600
我猜他是在半夜把她抓走
I guess he grabbed her in the middle of the night.

1397
02:02:09,740 --> 02:02:10,790
我们刚刚才知道
We just found out about it.

1398
02:02:11,740 --> 02:02:14,000
你别担心，我们会把她安全带回来
But I don't want you to worry. We'll get her back.

1399
02:02:14,170 --> 02:02:16,110
因为我有内线在里面
I've got a guy on the inside. Listen.

1400
02:02:16,340 --> 02:02:17,640
一定会把她带回来
We're gonna get her back.

1401
02:02:17,740 --> 02:02:19,140
他又自做主张了
Here we go.

1402
02:02:21,380 --> 02:02:24,410
队长，打扰，我得借一下飞机
Excuse me, Captain. I got to borrow your plane for a minute.

1403
02:02:24,620 --> 02:02:28,420
指挥官下令要你们默契配合，对吧？
Listen, Force Comm cleared you to give us total cooperation, right?

1404
02:02:28,690 --> 02:02:31,660
所谓的指挥官就是美国总统
And you know that comes directly from the president of these United States.

1405
02:02:32,330 --> 02:02:34,420
但你必须要先签字
But, sir, you're gonna have to sign for this aircraft.

1406
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:36,200
我会签的，有笔吗？
I'll sign for it. You got a pen? You take care of it.

1407
02:02:36,240 --> 02:02:38,550
你去准备文件，好吗？
Do you realize it has been ten years...

1408
02:02:38,670 --> 02:02:42,730
你已经10年没飞过这种飞机了
since you've been behind the wheel of one of these?

1409
02:02:42,900 --> 02:02:45,000
弄坏的话，就扣我薪水
I break it, they can take it out of my pay.

1410
02:02:46,010 --> 02:02:48,300
哈瑞，你听着，我们有内线
Listen, we got a guy on the inside.

1411
02:02:55,420 --> 02:02:56,940
大家快向后退，快走
Gotta move back, everybody! Let's go!

1412
02:02:57,380 --> 02:02:58,610
你在做什么？

1413
02:03:14,670 --> 02:03:16,690
你们别担心，不会有问题的
All right, everybody, it's gonna be all right!

1414
02:03:19,310 --> 02:03:21,430
他有100小时的飞行训练
He's got hundreds of hours in the Harriers there.

1415
02:03:25,610 --> 02:03:27,060
虽然有点生疏
He is a little rusty,

1416
02:03:27,200 --> 02:03:29,610
但那是他一贯的起飞方式
but that's a trademark Tasker takeoff.

1417
02:03:29,980 --> 02:03:32,850
就像骑脚踏车，永远不会忘记
It's like riding a bike. You never forget, really.

1418
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:37,880
我们最好先躲一下
We might wanna seek shelter!

1419
02:03:43,460 --> 02:03:44,490
抱歉
Sorry.

1420
02:03:46,870 --> 02:03:47,560
太差劲了吧？
Fuck!

1421
02:04:07,790 --> 02:04:10,420
街上围满了观望者
The streets are filled with people...

1422
02:04:10,590 --> 02:04:13,080
警方正在疏散大厦中的人
as police try to evacuate the buildings.

1423
02:04:13,290 --> 02:04:16,260
恐怖组织正朝天疯狂射击
They appear to be shooting wildly into the air as I'm speaking.

1424
02:04:16,430 --> 02:04:18,290
似乎是预警
These seem to be warning shots.

1425
02:04:18,470 --> 02:04:19,430
但到目前为止
So far...

1426
02:04:19,500 --> 02:04:20,930
没向我们或警方开枪
they have not fired at us or police.

1427
02:04:20,930 --> 02:04:22,560
很明显的…
This apparently is...

1428
02:04:22,740 --> 02:04:24,110
他们和引爆启思岛的…
the same group which just detonated a nuclear bomb...

1429
02:04:24,200 --> 02:04:25,200
暴徒是同一组织
in the Florida Keys.

1430
02:04:25,210 --> 02:04:26,950
红伐党每个星期…
Crimson Jihad will...

1431
02:04:27,110 --> 02:04:29,470
将血洗一个美国主要城市
rain fire on one major U.S. city each week...

1432
02:04:29,680 --> 02:04:31,770
直到你们退出为止
until our demands are met.

1433
02:04:32,810 --> 02:04:36,510
这个录影带是在恐怖份子…
This tape was released to the media just minutes after the terrorists

1434
02:04:36,720 --> 02:04:38,450
我要上厕所
I have to go to the bathroom.

1435
02:04:38,620 --> 02:04:41,620
现场实况报导后
We'll repeat the tape...

1436
02:04:41,720 --> 02:04:44,220
我们会重播这段录影带
following this live report from the scene.

1437
02:04:47,790 --> 02:04:49,460
不要开枪
Hold your fire!

1438
02:04:49,860 --> 02:04:51,550
你要求的录影小组到了
The video crew you wanted is here!

1439
02:04:51,660 --> 02:04:52,850
让他们进来
Send them!

1440
02:04:55,070 --> 02:04:57,400
他们进来了，没有携带武器
They're coming in. They're unarmed.

1441
02:05:14,320 --> 02:05:15,410
好，去吧
Come on. Let's go.

1442
02:05:16,120 --> 02:05:16,990
快点
Go.

1443
02:05:23,360 --> 02:05:25,830
这是红伐党的公告
This is a communiqu? from Crimson Jihad.

1444
02:05:26,800 --> 02:05:29,030
你们已经看到我们的力量
You have seen a demonstration of our power.

1445
02:05:30,070 --> 02:05:32,330
别逼我毁掉这个城市
Do not force us to destroy this city...

1446
02:05:32,570 --> 02:05:34,540
也不要与我们对抗
and do not try to use force against us.

1447
02:05:34,740 --> 02:05:36,830
我们视死如归
I, we are all prepared to die.

1448
02:05:37,880 --> 02:05:39,310
只要把那个钥匙一转
With one turn of that key...

1449
02:05:41,110 --> 02:05:44,640
200万的市民就会立即死亡
two million of your people will die instantly!

1450
02:05:45,020 --> 02:05:46,850
- 什么钥匙？  - 就是那个钥匙
- What key? - That key!

1451
02:05:48,350 --> 02:05:49,580
谁拿走了？
Who's taken the key?

1452
02:05:56,230 --> 02:05:56,990
射她！
Shoot her!

1453
02:06:23,020 --> 02:06:24,510
好险呀！
Holy shit!

1454
02:06:56,860 --> 02:06:59,650
第一组呼叫第七组，情况怎样？
Unit One to Unit Seven. Give me a situation report.

1455
02:07:00,060 --> 02:07:01,750
第七组，报告现况
One to Seven. Give me a sit rep.

1456
02:07:01,860 --> 02:07:03,150
费絮，听到吗？
Faisil, do you copy?

1457
02:07:04,660 --> 02:07:06,530
这是第七组，已攻下第21楼
Seven here. 21st floor secure.

1458
02:07:06,730 --> 02:07:09,050
在20楼内大约有12个党徒
About 12 faction members on the 20th floor.

1459
02:07:09,130 --> 02:07:10,450
没有人质
No hostages there.

1460
02:07:10,640 --> 02:07:12,500
- 达娜呢？  - 她在屋顶上
- Where's Dana? - She's on the roof.

1461
02:07:12,710 --> 02:07:15,230
好，你们等我，再把地址讲一遍
Okay, stay put. Give me that address again.

1462
02:07:21,680 --> 02:07:23,440
你杀了我，钥匙就会掉下去
You shoot me, this'll fall!

1463
02:07:26,120 --> 02:07:28,990
你待在那里，别过来！
Stay where you are! Stay where you are!

1464
02:07:33,190 --> 02:07:34,220
把钥匙给我
Give me the key!

1465
02:07:34,390 --> 02:07:35,920
我发誓会把它丢下去！
I'll drop it, I swear!

1466
02:07:36,100 --> 02:07:36,490
不要

1467
02:07:40,570 --> 02:07:41,730
把钥匙给我
Give me the key.

1468
02:07:42,970 --> 02:07:45,960
孩子，你并不想死，对吗？
Come on, child. You don't want to die, do you?

1469
02:07:48,370 --> 02:07:51,780
把钥匙给我，我就不伤你
Give me the key and you won't get hurt.

1470
02:07:52,750 --> 02:07:54,540
我向你保证
I give you my word!

1471
02:07:55,850 --> 02:07:57,870
别做梦了，你这个疯子
No way, you wacko!

1472
02:08:03,320 --> 02:08:05,090
救命！
Help me!

1473
02:08:55,840 --> 02:08:57,640
不要再过来
Please don't come any closer!

1474
02:09:01,080 --> 02:09:02,710
救命呀！
Help me!

1475
02:09:03,150 --> 02:09:04,310
谁来帮我呀！
Somebody!

1476
02:09:07,490 --> 02:09:12,050
快来救我！
Help me!

1477
02:09:16,600 --> 02:09:18,220
达娜，跳下来
Dana, jump down!

1478
02:09:18,560 --> 02:09:19,760
快跳下来！
Jump down!

1479
02:09:20,830 --> 02:09:21,700
爸？
Dad?

1480
02:09:31,010 --> 02:09:31,870
救我呀！
Help me!

1481
02:09:32,480 --> 02:09:33,540
爸！
Daddy!

1482
02:10:07,950 --> 02:10:09,740
爸，快回来！
Daddy, come back!

1483
02:10:14,890 --> 02:10:16,860
爸，救我下来！
Daddy, get me down!

1484
02:10:17,660 --> 02:10:19,090
爸！
Daddy!

1485
02:10:21,430 --> 02:10:23,450
跳下来
Jump! Jump!

1486
02:10:23,660 --> 02:10:25,190
我会接住你的
Daddy will catch you!

1487
02:10:25,530 --> 02:10:27,400
- 跳呀！  - 我不敢跳
-Jump! - I can't!

1488
02:10:31,870 --> 02:10:32,960
抓紧
Hold on!

1489
02:10:42,820 --> 02:10:45,010
爸，千万别让我掉下去！
Don't you let me fall, please!

1490
02:10:45,750 --> 02:10:47,250
- 爸！  - 别害怕
- Daddy! - I got you!

1491
02:10:47,420 --> 02:10:49,090
我要滑下去了
I'm slipping!

1492
02:10:51,390 --> 02:10:52,860
不！达娜

1493
02:10:53,260 --> 02:10:54,950
救我，我要滑下去了！
Help me! I'm gonna fall!

1494
02:11:02,170 --> 02:11:03,030
抓住我的手
Hold my hand!

1495
02:11:07,470 --> 02:11:08,960
抓紧点
Hold on tight, honey.

1496
02:12:05,500 --> 02:12:07,230
他在你后面！
He's behind you!

1497
02:12:08,030 --> 02:12:11,330
快降落，否则就杀了她！
Take this plane down, now! I'll kill her!

1498
02:12:11,900 --> 02:12:14,170
快降落，就现在！
Take it down, now!

1499
02:12:31,020 --> 02:12:32,990
天啊，想点办法呀！
My God, do something!

1500
02:12:39,060 --> 02:12:39,960
（发射钮）

1501
02:12:40,870 --> 02:12:41,830
你被炒了
You're fired.

1502
02:13:28,350 --> 02:13:29,410
好啦，没事了
It's okay.

1503
02:13:31,420 --> 02:13:32,380
达娜

1504
02:13:33,090 --> 02:13:35,280
甜心，都结束了
Honey, it's over.

1505
02:13:44,730 --> 02:13:46,060
嗨，小鬼头
Hi, pumpkin.

1506
02:13:49,040 --> 02:13:51,600
飞机刚一降落…
Just seconds after the jet landed...

1507
02:13:51,770 --> 02:13:53,700
身份不明的驾驶员…
the unidentified pilot was escorted...

1508
02:13:53,790 --> 02:13:55,400
马上由FBI护送离去
from the scene by Federal agents.

1509
02:13:55,640 --> 02:13:56,900
虽然我们不清楚…
Though it is unclear at this moment...

1510
02:13:57,040 --> 02:13:58,700
今早是哪个单位的探员
which agency was responsible...

1511
02:13:58,880 --> 02:14:01,310
这么戏剧化的结束了…
for the operation which ended the terrorist threat...

1512
02:14:01,480 --> 02:14:03,480
一场恐怖组织的威胁
so dramatically early this morning...

1513
02:14:03,580 --> 02:14:05,710
但据迈阿密警方的消息…
we've learned from Miami Police Do it properly.

1514
02:14:09,890 --> 02:14:14,600
（一年后）

1515
02:14:15,930 --> 02:14:20,130
一、二、三、四，开始拇指战
One, two, three, four, I declare a thumb war.

1516
02:14:20,270 --> 02:14:23,330
五、六、七、八，竖起拇指来
Five, six, seven, eight, try to keep your thumbs straight.

1517
02:14:23,500 --> 02:14:25,300
不要这样！停止
Don't! Stop it!

1518
02:14:25,500 --> 02:14:26,270
等一下
Wait!

1519
02:14:27,140 --> 02:14:28,330
我逮到你了
I got you!

1520
02:14:28,610 --> 02:14:31,240
你要听清楚规则
Just listen. Listen to the rules.

1521
02:14:36,320 --> 02:14:37,080
喂
Hello?

1522
02:14:37,250 --> 02:14:38,480
是波里斯和桃乐丝吗？
Boris and Doris?

1523
02:14:39,820 --> 02:14:40,790
我们有任务了
We're on.

1524
02:14:43,260 --> 02:14:44,810
是的，请说
Yes? Go ahead.

1525
02:15:13,020 --> 02:15:14,880
上校，真高兴又见到你
Colonel, how nice to see you again.

1526
02:15:15,050 --> 02:15:16,020
晚上好
Good evening.

1527
02:15:17,460 --> 02:15:18,420
她是谁？
Who was that?

1528
02:15:28,400 --> 02:15:30,960
情况如何？看到接头人了吗？
What's the scoop, team? You see your contact yet?

1529
02:15:31,340 --> 02:15:32,900
还没看到
Haven't seen him yet.

1530
02:15:34,610 --> 02:15:36,870
但是有个人，我倒想打个招呼
But I see somebody I'd like to say hello to.

1531
02:15:37,480 --> 02:15:39,210
再替你添点香槟
Let me pour you some more champagne.

1532
02:15:39,710 --> 02:15:41,510
我一定要扮得像个服务生
I got to keep up the waiter bit.

一般来说，监视有时很危险

1535
02:15:48,320 --> 02:15:50,350
如果真的发生你先躲起来
If it gets rough, stay low until it's over...

1536
02:15:50,490 --> 02:15:51,850
以后会联络你

1537
02:15:51,860 --> 02:15:53,190
最好把你的…

Oh, God.

1542
02:16:13,050 --> 02:16:14,880
你不是没有害怕的权利吗？
Fear is not an option.

1543
02:16:27,560 --> 02:16:28,530
跳舞吧
Dance?

1544
02:16:31,830 --> 02:16:32,530
哦，不要啊

1545

哈瑞、海伦，伙计们，拜托别跳了
Harry? Helen? Guys? Come on, now.

1547
02:16:53,520 --> 02:16:55,450
否则会分散注意力的
Let's not get distracted.

1548

我们还有重要的事要办

好啦，别这样嘛
All right, guys. Come on.

1550
02:17:06,500 --> 02:17:08,100
你们最好正经点
You guys better get serious in there.

1551
02:17:08,260 --> 02:17:09,930
换成我就会很认真
I'd be serious if I was in there.

1552
02:17:12,440 --> 02:17:15,240
哈瑞，别不理我，那样很不礼貌
Don't ignore me, Harry. That's rude.

1553
02:17:18,540 --> 02:17:19,940
好啦，伙计们，别酱子
All right, guys. Come on.

1554

海伦，我一直是站在你那边的

1566
02:18:22,110 --> 02:18:23,970
下次换你们呆着
You guys are gonna be in the van next time.

1567
02:18:24,710 --> 02:18:25,440
真不公平

1568
