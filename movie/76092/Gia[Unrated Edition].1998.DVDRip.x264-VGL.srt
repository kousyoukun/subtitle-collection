1
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:59,391
At that time,
everybody was tall, thin and blond.

2
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:04,362
Everybody posed,
everybody gave you a look.

3
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:06,899
But Gia was different.

4
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,993
She was the first one who-
who moved.

5
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,370
They all try to do it now-
give you an attitude-

6
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:16,875
but she invented it.

7
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:19,411
She always followed her instincts...

8
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:22,311
no matter
where they took her.

9
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:27,046
It was probably the best
and the worst thing about her.

10
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,385
With Gia, it was always
about the sex-

11
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:33,358
every look, every move,
every minute.

12
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:35,818
Every day.

13
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:40,491
Sex.

14
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:43,432
They were jealous of her.
They still are.

15
00:01:43,535 --> 00:01:45,526
That's why they say those things.

16
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:49,597
She would come on to everybody,
but it was really innocent.

17
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:53,508
I mean, nobody was ever
really offended by it.

18
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:57,015
I don't think it had anything
to do with sex.

19
00:01:57,249 --> 00:02:00,446
Even when she was sleeping around,
sex was not the goal.

20
00:02:00,752 --> 00:02:03,016
Sex wasn't really an issue.

21
00:02:03,355 --> 00:02:06,756
Yeah, I knew about the drugs.

22
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:10,761
I was afraid of the drugs,
the way people used them.

23
00:02:10,863 --> 00:02:12,558
It all just happened so fast.

24
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:14,895
You know, all of a sudden,
her face was just everywhere.

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,869
Every model has a moment-
I mean, the ones who make it at all.

26
00:02:19,972 --> 00:02:24,341
And being of the moment
is everything in fashion.

27
00:02:24,443 --> 00:02:29,574
Fashion is not art.
Fashion isn't even culture.

28
00:02:29,848 --> 00:02:31,941
Fashion is advertising...

29
00:02:32,017 --> 00:02:35,043
and advertising is money.

30
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:40,357
And for every dollar you earn,
someone has to pay.

31
00:03:12,723 --> 00:03:16,454
Once upon a time,
once upon a time.

32
00:03:19,362 --> 00:03:21,626
It was a fairy tale.

33
00:03:22,766 --> 00:03:25,667
It was.
It was a fairy tale come true.

34
00:03:28,672 --> 00:03:31,232
I had two boys, you know,
but boys you lose.

35
00:03:31,341 --> 00:03:35,334
They go away, they marry other women.
They're gone.

36
00:03:35,645 --> 00:03:38,671
A girl you have forever.

37
00:03:38,782 --> 00:03:42,013
When Gia was born,
I said, "This one is mine.

38
00:03:42,385 --> 00:03:45,445
- Look at you.
- All mine. "

39
00:03:45,555 --> 00:03:47,614
Look at me.

40
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:50,553
Look at us.

41
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,897
Look how pretty we are.

42
00:03:54,697 --> 00:03:58,463
Do I be- Do I be
the prettiest, prettiest girl?

43
00:03:58,534 --> 00:04:02,664
You do.
You do be the prettiest. You do.

44
00:04:08,043 --> 00:04:10,876
- Where the hell have you been?
- Out.

45
00:04:10,946 --> 00:04:15,042
- Out? Out? Out where?
- Out.

46
00:04:15,116 --> 00:04:16,413
Oh, Joe, don't start.

47
00:04:16,518 --> 00:04:19,387
Don't tell me, "Don't start. "
Out where? Tell me where you've been.

48
00:04:19,422 --> 00:04:21,355
- Joe, lower your voice.
- Don't tell me to lower my voice.

49
00:04:21,423 --> 00:04:23,414
- The kids know you were out all night.
- Cut it out!

50
00:04:23,525 --> 00:04:26,221
- Tell them where you've been.
- I'm not in the mood for this tonight.

51
00:04:26,294 --> 00:04:28,888
Not in the mood, huh?

52
00:04:28,997 --> 00:04:31,124
- Just leave me alone.
- Who were you with Kathleen?

53
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:34,031
- It's none of your business.
- Don't tell me that, you fucking whore.

54
00:04:34,102 --> 00:04:37,367
- Get out of the kitchen.
- Let me see. Did he fuck you?

55
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:39,999
- Where? Let me feel!
- Pig! Get your hands off!

56
00:04:40,108 --> 00:04:42,167
- Who else has been in there besides me?
- Get your hands off of me, jerk.

57
00:04:42,244 --> 00:04:44,212
- Who else, huh?
- You know how you make me feel?

58
00:04:44,312 --> 00:04:47,509
- You make me wanna die. You know that?
- You wanna die? No!

59
00:04:47,582 --> 00:04:50,449
You don't die until I tell you
you can die. Do you hear me?

60
00:04:50,552 --> 00:04:52,452
That's when you die!

61
00:05:05,032 --> 00:05:08,900
Here, take this and put it in the car.
I'll keep this one.

62
00:05:22,383 --> 00:05:24,044
Once upon a time...

63
00:05:25,285 --> 00:05:27,480
in a kingdom far, far away...

64
00:05:27,888 --> 00:05:29,879
there lived a young girl...

65
00:05:30,123 --> 00:05:32,091
whose hair was made of gold.

66
00:05:32,359 --> 00:05:35,658
When the people
in the village saw her, they said...

67
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:38,459
"Oh, how beautiful she is. "

68
00:05:38,565 --> 00:05:41,796
One cheese steak, one meat ball,
one salami provolone.

69
00:05:42,202 --> 00:05:46,730
I'll be back by 4:00.
Try not to burn the place down.

70
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:50,137
- Gia, you're in charge.
- All right, boss.

71
00:05:52,412 --> 00:05:55,347
Hey, get the food.
Go, come on, get outta here.

72
00:05:55,515 --> 00:05:58,109
- Get the cash register.
- I'm in charge!

73
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:04,388
- Is your name Gia?
- Yeah.

74
00:06:07,126 --> 00:06:09,117
- Got a light?
- Stop screwing around.

75
00:06:09,228 --> 00:06:12,061
I've seen you a few times
around the neighborhood...

76
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:14,265
- and-
- Are you nervous?

77
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,161
Yeah.

78
00:06:17,469 --> 00:06:19,801
Am I making you nervous?

79
00:06:19,972 --> 00:06:21,234
Yeah.

80
00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:27,344
Well, good,
'cause that's the idea.

81
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,414
- What's that?
- You scare the shit out of people...

82
00:06:31,616 --> 00:06:34,551
and then they don't see
how scared you are.

83
00:06:36,721 --> 00:06:38,188
Are you scared?

84
00:06:41,926 --> 00:06:44,523
What's your name?

85
00:06:44,558 --> 00:06:47,121
T.J. Tom Junior...

86
00:06:47,332 --> 00:06:49,232
but T.J. is what they call me.

87
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,938
T.J. and Gia.

88
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,605
I like that. Come on.

89
00:06:59,677 --> 00:07:02,544
- I'm leaving.
- Wait a minute. Where you going?

90
00:07:02,647 --> 00:07:04,877
I'm in charge, and I'm leaving.

91
00:07:10,087 --> 00:07:12,078
- Is that the Byrds?
- They're so cool.

92
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:15,217
Oh, wow.
Ooh, rock my world.

93
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,223
Seventy-five cents?

94
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:23,862
It's pretty. Pretty.
Very pretty.

95
00:07:23,934 --> 00:07:25,561
Hello, ladies.

96
00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:27,569
Can I have this?
Come on.

97
00:07:31,842 --> 00:07:35,243
- Tattoo? You getting a tattoo now?
- Tattoos. Tattoo you.

98
00:07:35,512 --> 00:07:37,571
No, tattoo you.

99
00:07:37,681 --> 00:07:41,173
- I'm not getting a tattoo.
- Oh, come on. What?

100
00:07:41,285 --> 00:07:43,219
Look at that hair.
It's fabulous.

101
00:07:49,526 --> 00:07:51,255
You want a tattoo now?

102
00:07:53,497 --> 00:07:55,727
She'd be a lot of fun.

103
00:08:00,137 --> 00:08:03,129
Who are you looking at,
him or me?

104
00:09:44,438 --> 00:09:46,531
Oh, I can't talk about the sex.

105
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,167
I mean, how would I know?

106
00:09:50,244 --> 00:09:54,613
If you ask me,
she never really had sex with anybody.

107
00:09:57,117 --> 00:09:59,085
But she did love to be photographed...

108
00:09:59,152 --> 00:10:02,485
and people loved to take pictures of her
and do little things for her.

109
00:10:02,589 --> 00:10:05,422
She hated being photographed.

110
00:10:06,026 --> 00:10:10,520
You had to run after her
and tie her down.

111
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:15,533
Then you had to get past the clothes
and the stuff in her hair.

112
00:10:16,636 --> 00:10:18,399
But she was special.

113
00:10:51,136 --> 00:10:53,730
Let's go.

114
00:10:53,838 --> 00:10:55,772
Coming, coming.

115
00:11:00,311 --> 00:11:02,074
All right, let's go.

116
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,227
And they showed her
a beautiful house...

117
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:21,127
on the planet Mars.

118
00:11:21,199 --> 00:11:24,600
And they said,
"Come and live here forever. "

119
00:11:24,703 --> 00:11:27,171
And the young girl said...

120
00:11:27,238 --> 00:11:30,730
"Oh, Mars is a planet
where life's different-

121
00:11:30,842 --> 00:11:33,777
safe, clean and pretty. "

122
00:11:36,114 --> 00:11:39,140
But- But how do you get there?

123
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:43,183
Where do you find a taxi?
Which bus do you take?

124
00:11:43,454 --> 00:11:48,016
Right? And how do you know
you're there when you're there?

125
00:11:48,526 --> 00:11:52,018
Philadelphia was not ready for this.

126
00:11:54,031 --> 00:11:55,760
But New York was.

127
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:03,829
It was the right moment...

128
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:08,435
and being of the moment
is everything in fashion.

129
00:12:08,945 --> 00:12:12,847
But of course,
the more you were of the moment...

130
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,316
the faster you become
of the past.

131
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:24,559
Okay, let's get this over with.

132
00:12:24,594 --> 00:12:27,859
Just go in there
and try to be nice.

133
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:30,894
- Nice? Nice.
- Yeah.

134
00:12:30,967 --> 00:12:34,130
Who knows?
Maybe they'll like you.

135
00:12:34,603 --> 00:12:38,334
- You are a very likable girl.
- Fuck you.

136
00:12:46,115 --> 00:12:47,548
Hi.

137
00:12:50,653 --> 00:12:52,587
I'm here to see Wilhelmina Cooper.

138
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:57,216
So's the rest of the world and the rest
of the world's way ahead of you, honey.

139
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:58,959
Take a seat.

140
00:13:00,262 --> 00:13:01,286
I have an appointment.

141
00:13:03,232 --> 00:13:04,494
Hold, please.

142
00:13:06,134 --> 00:13:07,396
Of course you do.

143
00:13:07,802 --> 00:13:11,260
11:00, Gia Marie Carangi.

144
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:12,863
G what?

145
00:13:15,076 --> 00:13:16,839
Okay.

146
00:13:26,688 --> 00:13:30,317
There. Gia.
Just fuck the rest of it. Call me Gia.

147
00:13:30,425 --> 00:13:33,394
Do you think you can remember that,
honey?

148
00:13:33,861 --> 00:13:37,262
Yeah? Cool.
Now tell the bitch I'm here.

149
00:13:44,472 --> 00:13:48,067
I've already seen the pictures, darling.
Maurice sent them.

150
00:13:48,176 --> 00:13:50,110
I wanted to see the real thing.

151
00:13:50,478 --> 00:13:52,036
Well, this is it.

152
00:13:52,146 --> 00:13:54,808
It certainly is.

153
00:13:55,082 --> 00:13:58,176
You practically gave
my receptionist a coronary.

154
00:13:59,453 --> 00:14:01,546
Yeah, well, look.

155
00:14:01,656 --> 00:14:04,022
This was a free trip to New York...

156
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,219
and if I knew you were looking
for Marcia-fucking-Brady...

157
00:14:07,294 --> 00:14:08,591
I would've stayed home.

158
00:14:08,695 --> 00:14:11,960
How do you know
what I'm looking for?

159
00:14:18,071 --> 00:14:22,132
- Look at me.
- I'm looking, I'm looking.

160
00:14:22,242 --> 00:14:25,541
You know, dressing like
a motorcycle tramp...

161
00:14:25,646 --> 00:14:29,673
is somewhat interesting
for a 17-year-old girl.

162
00:14:30,117 --> 00:14:32,483
Talking like one is not.

163
00:14:32,752 --> 00:14:37,314
In fact, talking at all is not really
required in this profession...

164
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,654
or even encouraged.

165
00:14:40,126 --> 00:14:43,061
Anything you might have to say
you say through the camera...

166
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:44,926
the image, huh...

167
00:14:44,998 --> 00:14:47,466
and hopefully the product.

168
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,431
What comes out of your mouth
is totally irrelevant.

169
00:14:51,537 --> 00:14:52,765
Understood?

170
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,968
Yes, sir.

171
00:14:56,275 --> 00:15:00,006
Now, this is a career.

172
00:15:00,212 --> 00:15:02,373
This is a future.

173
00:15:02,581 --> 00:15:04,515
This is a life...

174
00:15:06,118 --> 00:15:07,380
if you want it.

175
00:15:07,486 --> 00:15:09,511
Does that mean
you can get me a job?

176
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:15,761
I get you the interviews.

177
00:15:15,796 --> 00:15:17,729
You get the job.

178
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:26,564
And I believe you will.

179
00:15:26,638 --> 00:15:29,106
Dear Diary, this is my life.

180
00:15:29,374 --> 00:15:32,707
Go see Young & Rubicom, 9:45.

181
00:15:32,811 --> 00:15:35,837
Go see people at Revlon, 11:15.

182
00:15:35,948 --> 00:15:40,112
Go see Demi Moore, Bob Stone,
Somebody Malowinksi...

183
00:15:40,385 --> 00:15:44,082
and "Get lost, honey.
You ain't what we're lookin' for. "

184
00:15:44,556 --> 00:15:48,492
- Next!
- Thank you and fuck you. Bye.

185
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:53,363
Yeah, I go see, I go see.
Nobody sees me.

186
00:15:53,431 --> 00:15:57,162
"Ah, piece of meat, come here.
Show me your bag. "

187
00:15:57,401 --> 00:15:59,528
And they stick their finger in you.

188
00:15:59,637 --> 00:16:01,832
"I just wanna taste your temperature. "

189
00:16:02,907 --> 00:16:06,172
Go see, go see, go see,
go see somebody else.

190
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,936
I ain't no good at this.
I ain't no good at this at all.

191
00:16:10,047 --> 00:16:14,677
But even if you are good at it,
what, exactly, are you good at?

192
00:16:16,687 --> 00:16:19,679
- You can't leave now.
- I have to go.

193
00:16:19,923 --> 00:16:22,721
What, what?
To Philadelphia?

194
00:16:22,926 --> 00:16:26,362
- For what?
- I got stuff.

195
00:16:26,463 --> 00:16:28,397
I have to go.

196
00:16:28,965 --> 00:16:33,868
Well, somebody has to take care of me.
I'm just a kid.

197
00:16:33,937 --> 00:16:35,871
Bullshit.

198
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,415
What's in Philadelphia
that's more important than me?

199
00:16:49,052 --> 00:16:51,486
- Do not do that.
- Do not do what?

200
00:16:53,022 --> 00:16:56,219
Do not pretend you're gonna do something
when you know you're not.

201
00:16:56,292 --> 00:16:58,226
What am I not gonna do?

202
00:17:13,142 --> 00:17:14,404
What else?

203
00:17:33,462 --> 00:17:35,054
What?

204
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:49,410
- Know what I want?
- What?

205
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:00,716
What?

206
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,960
How do they fit?

207
00:18:29,217 --> 00:18:31,014
This turn you on?

208
00:18:33,054 --> 00:18:34,646
Yeah.

209
00:18:35,355 --> 00:18:36,845
- Kinda.
- All right.

210
00:18:36,924 --> 00:18:38,619
Come here.

211
00:18:48,468 --> 00:18:52,165
- Have you ever had sex with a man?
- Yeah.

212
00:18:53,273 --> 00:18:54,535
Once.

213
00:18:55,275 --> 00:18:57,334
And?

214
00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:01,346
And I could've done that
with a German shepherd.

215
00:19:09,488 --> 00:19:12,548
Dear Book, this is
another day in the life.

216
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:15,355
A life is like a book.
A book is like a box.

217
00:19:15,461 --> 00:19:18,760
A box has six sides,
inside and outside.

218
00:19:18,831 --> 00:19:22,665
So how do you get
to what's inside?

219
00:19:22,768 --> 00:19:24,963
How do you get
what's inside out?

220
00:19:25,371 --> 00:19:27,396
Once upon a time,
there was a very pretty girl...

221
00:19:27,506 --> 00:19:30,703
who lived in a beautiful box
and everybody loved her.

222
00:19:39,384 --> 00:19:41,944
- Yes, hello?
- Hello?

223
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,955
- What?
- Who the hell is that?

224
00:19:45,057 --> 00:19:47,355
- Wili?
- Who is it?

225
00:19:47,726 --> 00:19:49,694
- Christ's sake.
- I couldn't sleep.

226
00:19:51,463 --> 00:19:54,193
- Middle of the night.
- It's very late.

227
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:56,597
- I know.
- Goddamn it.

228
00:19:56,701 --> 00:19:58,191
Is that your husband?

229
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:02,431
- Yes.
- Is he pissed?

230
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,034
Yes.

231
00:20:04,142 --> 00:20:08,044
Is it true that he drinks?
That's what everybody says.

232
00:20:08,146 --> 00:20:12,082
And he gets violent?

233
00:20:12,183 --> 00:20:14,117
What is it you want, Gia?

234
00:20:14,185 --> 00:20:17,018
If he ever lays a hand on you,
I'll fuckin' kill him.

235
00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:23,424
Why can't you sleep?

236
00:20:25,596 --> 00:20:27,154
Do you want me to come over?

237
00:20:27,264 --> 00:20:29,755
You're nervous about tomorrow.

238
00:20:37,374 --> 00:20:38,739
Yeah, I am.

239
00:20:39,176 --> 00:20:41,667
Well, everyone is nervous
on their first shoot.

240
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:44,179
You'll be fine.

241
00:20:44,648 --> 00:20:47,845
Yeah, I just don't know what to do.
You know?

242
00:20:48,351 --> 00:20:50,285
Did you do your colonic?

243
00:20:50,387 --> 00:20:52,321
Yeah.

244
00:20:53,156 --> 00:20:54,316
Good.

245
00:20:54,891 --> 00:20:59,692
Go to bed now.
Take one half...

246
00:20:59,796 --> 00:21:02,026
of the Nembutal-
the yellow and black.

247
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:06,066
You'll be fine.

248
00:21:07,036 --> 00:21:11,939
- Just be yourself.
- Okay, yeah.

249
00:21:12,008 --> 00:21:13,942
What is that?

250
00:21:15,845 --> 00:21:18,678
Oh, darling...

251
00:21:18,748 --> 00:21:24,084
if I could answer that for you
or for me...

252
00:21:24,453 --> 00:21:30,323
well, life on this planet
would be a very different proposition.

253
00:21:39,568 --> 00:21:41,229
So I tell her, "Look...

254
00:21:41,337 --> 00:21:43,396
I know Calvin...

255
00:21:43,505 --> 00:21:45,496
and I asked him about you...

256
00:21:45,574 --> 00:21:47,201
and he didn't know who you were. "

257
00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:49,573
- She's such a liar.
- Oh, man.

258
00:22:42,763 --> 00:22:45,459
Excuse me, can I help you?

259
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:49,969
Yeah, yeah.
Could I have some more coffee, please?

260
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:53,063
- Are you Gia?
- That's me.

261
00:22:53,173 --> 00:22:56,165
You're late.
Go wash your face.

262
00:22:56,276 --> 00:22:59,905
I already did.
It's nice to meet you too.

263
00:23:03,517 --> 00:23:05,917
What the hell
am I gonna do with you?

264
00:23:07,621 --> 00:23:09,145
I got it.

265
00:23:10,323 --> 00:23:14,225
I don't know.
I'm just some dumb girl from Philly.

266
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:17,621
Oh, my God, she's a beast.

267
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:20,257
She scares me.

268
00:23:20,367 --> 00:23:22,562
Oh, Phillipe, does she remind you
of your mother?

269
00:23:22,669 --> 00:23:24,637
No, she reminds me
of my brother.

270
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:27,298
He's in jail now, thank Jesus.

271
00:23:29,876 --> 00:23:31,138
Okay.

272
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:43,276
What?

273
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:46,746
It's wonderful.

274
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:49,956
Let's see this face.

275
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,592
I'm checking to see
if you need to be tweezed.

276
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:58,966
- I'm tweezed.
- I'm Linda.

277
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:01,937
Nice to meet you.

278
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,708
Dreadful.

279
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,302
Absolutely horrendous.

280
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:11,844
More teeth.

281
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:16,513
Every photograph makes a promise,
and the promise is never kept.

282
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,522
Look brain damaged.

283
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,524
That's what makes a photo great.

284
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,556
And if the promise is sex...

285
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:31,033
- then you really have something.
- Good.

286
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,003
Wonderful.

287
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:35,537
Well...

288
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:37,971
that was all shit.

289
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:40,102
- Fuck you.
- Now we can pay our rent.

290
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:42,612
Who wants to stay
and make some art?

291
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:45,474
What's art?

292
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:49,019
Keep the fence,
lose the clothes.

293
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,020
No, thanks, I'm gone.

294
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:53,682
I'm outta here.
See you.

295
00:24:59,964 --> 00:25:01,761
I'll stay if Linda stays.

296
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,632
- Linda, liebling?
- Yeah.

297
00:25:42,372 --> 00:25:44,033
Go stand by the fence.

298
00:25:44,107 --> 00:25:47,770
- You want me in the shot?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

299
00:25:47,844 --> 00:25:49,778
And lose the clothes.

300
00:28:23,904 --> 00:28:27,362
Sex- Sex was really easy.
It was.

301
00:28:27,441 --> 00:28:32,674
Sex was everywhere.
It didn't really mean too much.

302
00:28:32,747 --> 00:28:36,308
Love was the hard thing to find.

303
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:44,354
Even if you were looking for it,
which not too many people were.

304
00:28:47,522 --> 00:28:51,151
Even if you found it...

305
00:28:51,226 --> 00:28:53,160
which not too many people did...

306
00:28:53,228 --> 00:28:58,222
even if it was right there
in front of you...

307
00:29:01,233 --> 00:29:06,000
how could you see it
with all this sex in the way?

308
00:29:59,075 --> 00:30:03,102
Hey, where you going?

309
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:07,413
What happened?
What's the matter?

310
00:30:08,217 --> 00:30:10,651
You don't have any clothes on.

311
00:30:12,455 --> 00:30:14,252
Don't change the subject.

312
00:30:15,258 --> 00:30:17,886
I have a boyfriend.

313
00:30:18,494 --> 00:30:19,927
So?

314
00:30:20,029 --> 00:30:22,793
So, I have to go.

315
00:30:24,099 --> 00:30:26,431
I have to go, I have to go.
Everybody has to go.

316
00:30:26,535 --> 00:30:29,527
Where the fuck does everybody go
when they have to go?

317
00:30:30,873 --> 00:30:34,036
You- You and I had a-

318
00:30:34,109 --> 00:30:37,078
I mean, it was-
I had a-

319
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:44,484
I'm really very square.

320
00:30:45,587 --> 00:30:46,815
So am I.

321
00:30:46,922 --> 00:30:48,856
Yeah, I can see that.

322
00:30:51,894 --> 00:30:53,054
Please, don't go.

323
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:58,798
Please, don't go.
Please, I'll make you breakfast.

324
00:31:01,102 --> 00:31:03,002
Come on.

325
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:09,238
- Going down?
- No.

326
00:31:09,644 --> 00:31:11,544
- Yes.
- No!

327
00:31:11,613 --> 00:31:13,945
No, no.
What are you doing? No.

328
00:31:14,215 --> 00:31:16,843
- I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
- Linda!

329
00:31:17,752 --> 00:31:19,151
I'll call you.

330
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:30,487
It was like a puppy.

331
00:31:30,598 --> 00:31:33,897
Love me, love me, love me.

332
00:31:34,001 --> 00:31:35,468
I did.

333
00:31:36,604 --> 00:31:38,504
I did right away.

334
00:31:38,572 --> 00:31:41,973
Extraordinary,
as in phenomenal...

335
00:31:42,076 --> 00:31:44,510
as in a gold mine.

336
00:31:44,612 --> 00:31:49,447
Tough, vulnerable, old, young...

337
00:31:50,351 --> 00:31:52,444
decadent, innocent...

338
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,454
male, female.

339
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:59,250
You look like you don't give a shit.

340
00:32:03,997 --> 00:32:06,864
I met somebody,
someone I really like.

341
00:32:06,934 --> 00:32:09,869
Good. Good for you.

342
00:32:11,738 --> 00:32:14,673
Take a deep breath, darling.

343
00:32:14,775 --> 00:32:18,871
You are in for the ride
of your life.

344
00:32:35,962 --> 00:32:38,294
Paolo.

345
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:44,227
Lower the fucking drawbridge.
Give me some of those drink tickets.

346
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:48,273
Always a pleasure to see you too,
Stephie, and this must be Gia.

347
00:32:48,874 --> 00:32:51,069
How do you know my name?

348
00:32:51,176 --> 00:32:53,269
I'm god, I know everything.

349
00:32:53,379 --> 00:32:55,279
See, even god knows your name.

350
00:32:55,347 --> 00:32:58,145
With a face like that,
she doesn't need a name.

351
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:02,084
Actually, Tony,
my face is a little higher.

352
00:33:04,523 --> 00:33:07,321
Anytime, Gia, anytime.

353
00:33:07,393 --> 00:33:09,486
Stop being stingy, Tony.

354
00:33:18,703 --> 00:33:21,171
That's something to be on-
downers and champagne.

355
00:33:21,673 --> 00:33:23,240
Very rich.

356
00:33:23,275 --> 00:33:25,266
Ooh, did him in a car once.

357
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:28,240
I can't remember exactly
how fast we were going.

358
00:33:30,181 --> 00:33:33,947
That's Stan Girardi. Used to do it
with Cheryl, but he's doable.

359
00:33:34,052 --> 00:33:37,544
Ooh, Joe Jamison.
Beautiful, but gay.

360
00:33:38,189 --> 00:33:40,248
Not that that'd ever stop me.

361
00:33:43,327 --> 00:33:45,887
A little tongue up his ass...

362
00:33:45,963 --> 00:33:47,590
and he's all yours.

363
00:33:56,274 --> 00:33:57,901
You're full of shit, aren't you?

364
00:33:58,009 --> 00:34:01,911
Sometimes I don't believe it,
but it's all true.

365
00:34:02,013 --> 00:34:03,947
Okay, break it up.

366
00:34:05,483 --> 00:34:07,314
- On your left.
- Who was that?

367
00:34:07,418 --> 00:34:08,680
I have no idea.

368
00:34:33,262 --> 00:34:37,824
I do be the prettiest, prettiest girl.
I do be that.

369
00:34:50,545 --> 00:34:55,073
No, she's new, brand-new.
You have to see her. You'll like her.

370
00:35:05,726 --> 00:35:07,956
- She's on the cover.
- Gia, yeah.

371
00:35:08,062 --> 00:35:10,826
No last name.
Just Gia.

372
00:35:41,795 --> 00:35:42,784
Boring.

373
00:35:43,931 --> 00:35:45,990
Played out.

374
00:35:46,099 --> 00:35:47,657
Fat.

375
00:35:49,836 --> 00:35:51,098
Boring.

376
00:35:52,572 --> 00:35:53,834
Too dumb.

377
00:35:53,907 --> 00:35:56,899
For winter, we need meat.

378
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:59,557
We need someone
with blood in her veins.

379
00:35:59,592 --> 00:36:02,104
Not just suntan oil
and mineral water.

380
00:36:03,917 --> 00:36:07,910
Oh, God, I am so sick of her face.

381
00:36:13,526 --> 00:36:17,792
- Who's this?
- One of Wilhelmina's new girls, Gia.

382
00:36:26,706 --> 00:36:29,197
This is meat.

383
00:36:29,275 --> 00:36:33,177
This is sirloin.
It's lusty.

384
00:36:33,279 --> 00:36:37,579
Winter is carnivorous-
rich browns, reds, big animal prints.

385
00:36:37,884 --> 00:36:39,784
This is it. Yes!

386
00:36:55,467 --> 00:36:57,697
I just bought it.
What do you think?

387
00:36:57,769 --> 00:36:59,703
- Wow.
- "Wow"?

388
00:37:02,707 --> 00:37:04,641
Wanna go for a ride?

389
00:37:04,743 --> 00:37:08,304
- I don't know.
- Oh, oh, yeah, you do. Come on.

390
00:37:14,686 --> 00:37:15,948
Yes!

391
00:37:20,024 --> 00:37:22,219
- Where we going? What?
- Philadelphia.

392
00:37:25,196 --> 00:37:28,324
- Hold on!
- I am!

393
00:37:31,469 --> 00:37:32,458
Yeah?

394
00:37:34,271 --> 00:37:36,466
Hi, Kathleen.

395
00:37:38,909 --> 00:37:40,843
My God.

396
00:37:42,946 --> 00:37:46,507
Oh, my God!
Come on in.

397
00:37:47,518 --> 00:37:50,009
- Come on.
- This is my girlfriend, Linda.

398
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:54,955
Linda? Yeah, hi.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

399
00:37:55,025 --> 00:37:56,720
So, tell me about New York.

400
00:37:56,794 --> 00:37:59,695
Oh, God, it was like seeing
an old girlfriend.

401
00:37:59,797 --> 00:38:02,925
Oh, yeah, she told me all the gossip
about all the models.

402
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,960
You know, who had bad skin
and who had bad hair.

403
00:38:08,072 --> 00:38:10,097
The things that they did,
she told me about.

404
00:38:10,507 --> 00:38:12,907
And the places that they went-
Oh, my God.

405
00:38:14,812 --> 00:38:16,905
Oh, my God!

406
00:38:17,014 --> 00:38:19,949
You're on the cover of Vogue!
I can't believe it.

407
00:38:21,585 --> 00:38:25,385
Oh, my God, isn't that beautiful?

408
00:38:25,489 --> 00:38:27,923
Oh, honey.

409
00:38:28,324 --> 00:38:32,420
So what else is going on, huh?
Do you have a boyfriend?

410
00:38:32,695 --> 00:38:35,664
Uh, no.
Linda has a boyfriend.

411
00:38:35,765 --> 00:38:38,632
Oh, yeah?
Well, that's nice.

412
00:38:40,303 --> 00:38:44,262
- I have a girlfriend.
- Oh, yeah, that's nice too...

413
00:38:44,373 --> 00:38:47,001
though it's not
the same thing, is it?

414
00:38:47,109 --> 00:38:50,738
And we never talked about the past.
That was over.

415
00:38:50,846 --> 00:38:55,180
The past was the past.
She never discussed it with me once.

416
00:38:55,451 --> 00:38:59,387
It was like it never happened-
all those years in between.

417
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:03,224
It was like it never happened.

418
00:39:03,525 --> 00:39:06,790
I kept everything you've sent me.

419
00:39:06,995 --> 00:39:09,589
I keep everything
you ever touched...

420
00:39:09,698 --> 00:39:11,563
ever since you were a baby.

421
00:39:11,633 --> 00:39:14,568
What do I have?
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

422
00:39:14,836 --> 00:39:16,770
My journal.

423
00:39:20,909 --> 00:39:23,810
Once upon a time-

424
00:39:25,647 --> 00:39:29,083
"Once upon a time,
there was a girl with golden hair...

425
00:39:29,184 --> 00:39:33,382
who went to live
in a beautiful house. "

426
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:36,150
Always the same story.

427
00:39:36,757 --> 00:39:40,591
Always different,
always the same.

428
00:39:40,661 --> 00:39:42,686
Always the same.

429
00:39:48,502 --> 00:39:49,560
Can I see?

430
00:39:51,005 --> 00:39:52,563
Yeah.

431
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:01,843
Sometimes I think she was
a different person to everybody.

432
00:40:04,051 --> 00:40:06,076
Sometimes I knew who she was.

433
00:40:07,487 --> 00:40:10,285
Sometimes I didn't.

434
00:40:10,357 --> 00:40:14,760
Anybody who tries to tell you
exactly who she was...

435
00:40:15,028 --> 00:40:16,393
they didn't know her at all.

436
00:40:19,099 --> 00:40:22,535
We did everything together.
Yeah, in those days.

437
00:40:22,769 --> 00:40:24,532
Yeah, everything.

438
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,307
All right.

439
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:38,108
This is-

440
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:43,453
What can I say?
It's you.

441
00:40:43,756 --> 00:40:45,121
I found it on short notice.

442
00:40:47,827 --> 00:40:50,091
That's what it looks like.

443
00:40:51,364 --> 00:40:53,889
So, I was standing
in the middle of the living room...

444
00:40:53,967 --> 00:40:56,401
and the bathroom door opens.

445
00:40:59,572 --> 00:41:01,233
- Yeah?
- Who's that?

446
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,164
Who?

447
00:41:08,347 --> 00:41:11,214
I started making trips
to New York regularly after that.

448
00:41:11,283 --> 00:41:14,184
She wanted me there.
She wanted me there all the time.

449
00:41:14,286 --> 00:41:16,880
I couldn't because I had a husband,
I had a home.

450
00:41:17,456 --> 00:41:21,187
No, not red.
Yellow. Yellow roses.

451
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:24,691
But I would go,
and I would stay for maybe a week.

452
00:41:24,797 --> 00:41:26,731
Sometimes I would stay two.

453
00:41:26,799 --> 00:41:29,199
Love on ya, Gia.

454
00:41:32,504 --> 00:41:35,564
You're sending flowers to a girl?

455
00:41:37,209 --> 00:41:39,973
- Here, lady.
- Hi. Got it. Thanks.

456
00:41:49,554 --> 00:41:52,182
Christ, another one?

457
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:55,885
- Who died?
- None of your business.

458
00:41:59,697 --> 00:42:02,530
Are you fucking a florist
behind my back?

459
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:06,536
Yeah. Gold FTD guy
with the winged shoes.

460
00:42:14,345 --> 00:42:15,573
Hi.

461
00:42:20,084 --> 00:42:21,881
I've been calling you for weeks.

462
00:42:21,986 --> 00:42:23,351
Hi, Gia.

463
00:42:26,556 --> 00:42:31,391
- This is my boyfriend, Billy.
- Hi. I'm wrecked.

464
00:42:34,931 --> 00:42:38,094
- Do you wanna come in?
- I don't think that's a good idea.

465
00:42:38,201 --> 00:42:40,795
Why not?

466
00:42:40,871 --> 00:42:43,840
You are really beautiful.

467
00:42:44,107 --> 00:42:46,200
You're a model, aren't you?

468
00:42:46,743 --> 00:42:48,768
Why? Do I look stupid?

469
00:42:50,914 --> 00:42:54,042
- I have to work tomorrow.
- Come on, it's early.

470
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:58,086
Maybe- Maybe we could party.

471
00:43:07,063 --> 00:43:09,861
You are the most beautiful woman
I have ever seen.

472
00:43:09,966 --> 00:43:11,763
Come with me.

473
00:43:11,868 --> 00:43:13,130
I can't.

474
00:43:26,015 --> 00:43:27,277
See you around.

475
00:43:35,223 --> 00:43:37,157
What the fuck was that?

476
00:43:38,794 --> 00:43:40,694
Behold the florist.

477
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,874
I cannot stay!

478
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:33,741
I'll come back,
but I have to go home now.

479
00:44:33,847 --> 00:44:35,644
I'll come back.

480
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,279
If you need me, you just call me.

481
00:44:42,389 --> 00:44:44,880
I need you.
I need you now.

482
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:47,656
You have to be here now!

483
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:52,164
When I need you, I need you! Now!
I need you, Mom!

484
00:44:52,265 --> 00:44:57,225
Listen to me.
You are a big girl, all right?

485
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:02,704
- Please! Please!
- Act like a big girl.

486
00:45:02,942 --> 00:45:06,400
You've got to.
And you are.

487
00:45:08,114 --> 00:45:10,582
So be my big girl.

488
00:45:13,019 --> 00:45:14,452
Now listen to me.

489
00:45:18,958 --> 00:45:22,155
I have to go home.

490
00:45:22,461 --> 00:45:23,951
I have to.

491
00:45:24,063 --> 00:45:26,122
Fine. Fine!

492
00:45:27,967 --> 00:45:29,958
- Get out!
- All right, now wait.

493
00:45:30,069 --> 00:45:33,402
- Get the fuck out!
- No, not like this.

494
00:45:33,506 --> 00:45:35,974
Yeah, like this! Get out!
There. Get the fuck out!

495
00:45:36,475 --> 00:45:38,443
- For God's sake.
- Get out!

496
00:45:38,844 --> 00:45:41,210
- Not like this, not like this.
- Yeah, like this. Get the fuck out!

497
00:45:41,313 --> 00:45:43,543
- Look.
- There, get out!

498
00:45:43,648 --> 00:45:46,742
- All right. Fine, fine, fine. Fine.
- Go, go!

499
00:45:46,818 --> 00:45:49,651
- All right, fine.
- Get out!

500
00:45:52,824 --> 00:45:54,223
That's it.

501
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,760
That-

502
00:46:22,186 --> 00:46:26,145
She's booked for 16 shoots this week,
but I'll see what we can do.

503
00:46:26,557 --> 00:46:28,024
And you are erupting forms...

504
00:46:28,125 --> 00:46:29,353
Tell Scavullo he can have her-

505
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:32,395
out of the center
of all this tired, old beauty.

506
00:46:32,896 --> 00:46:34,488
Shaming them.

507
00:46:35,165 --> 00:46:38,430
Excuse me?
Tired, old beauty?

508
00:46:38,535 --> 00:46:43,438
You can have Renee. I know you want Gia,
but you can't have Gia. Not until June.

509
00:46:43,506 --> 00:46:46,907
This little wop is not standing
in front of me. You got that?

510
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:49,035
I'm off to the side, or I walk.

511
00:46:49,145 --> 00:46:51,545
Yeah, me too.

512
00:46:51,648 --> 00:46:53,013
Does this dress
make my ass look fat?

513
00:46:53,116 --> 00:46:55,584
Your ass is fat, honey.

514
00:46:55,652 --> 00:46:58,587
And I'm not standing
next to her fat ass.

515
00:47:03,093 --> 00:47:04,492
I know.

516
00:47:08,131 --> 00:47:11,100
Life is so disappointing.

517
00:47:11,701 --> 00:47:13,999
Here you are.

518
00:47:14,103 --> 00:47:16,094
You have arrived.

519
00:47:16,339 --> 00:47:20,105
You are here.
This is your moment.

520
00:47:22,178 --> 00:47:24,544
What do you have?

521
00:47:24,647 --> 00:47:26,581
You have pain.

522
00:47:30,086 --> 00:47:32,884
When you have everything...

523
00:47:32,989 --> 00:47:35,389
what do you have?

524
00:47:35,491 --> 00:47:38,326
You have nothing.

525
00:47:38,361 --> 00:47:42,297
When everything is right,
everything is wrong.

526
00:47:43,399 --> 00:47:46,664
It's disappointing.
It's confusing.

527
00:47:47,236 --> 00:47:50,797
This is life.
What can you do?

528
00:47:53,475 --> 00:47:56,069
People keep going away from me.
That hurts.

529
00:47:59,915 --> 00:48:01,177
Work.

530
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:04,144
Work.
You have a gift.

531
00:48:04,552 --> 00:48:06,179
Use it.

532
00:48:06,254 --> 00:48:09,382
Life will be there later.

533
00:48:09,491 --> 00:48:13,188
When you've worked
and you've lived...

534
00:48:14,696 --> 00:48:17,130
and you know who you are,
life is easy.

535
00:48:19,267 --> 00:48:21,497
Work.

536
00:48:21,569 --> 00:48:24,003
It's the only answer I know.

537
00:48:25,473 --> 00:48:27,236
I should've been a rock star.

538
00:48:29,243 --> 00:48:31,177
But I can't sing.

539
00:48:35,216 --> 00:48:37,013
Work now.

540
00:48:37,118 --> 00:48:39,052
You can live later.

541
00:48:41,656 --> 00:48:44,056
You'd say anything
to get that shot.

542
00:48:44,926 --> 00:48:46,928
- Yes.
- Yes.

543
00:48:47,328 --> 00:48:50,297
In this case,
I'm saying the truth.

544
00:48:53,234 --> 00:48:54,326
Sweetheart.

545
00:48:54,435 --> 00:48:57,666
Now here's the picture.
You girls all hate Gia...

546
00:48:57,938 --> 00:49:00,463
because she is so much prettier
than the rest of you.

547
00:49:00,574 --> 00:49:03,509
You're all so boring.

548
00:49:03,577 --> 00:49:06,171
She is so exciting.

549
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:10,546
If you don't like it,
please vanish from my world.

550
00:49:11,018 --> 00:49:12,918
No, I'm sorry,
she's not available.

551
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,181
I know, darling.
You can't get-

552
00:49:15,255 --> 00:49:17,519
And she went to live
in a beautiful house...

553
00:49:17,624 --> 00:49:21,526
and all the people loved her,
and she was very, very happy.

554
00:49:21,594 --> 00:49:25,462
No, she's on her way to Rome then.
She's shooting Versace in Milan...

555
00:49:25,565 --> 00:49:27,362
and Yves St. -Laurent in Paris.

556
00:49:27,934 --> 00:49:30,698
Perry has her for
the only runway show she's doing.

557
00:49:30,803 --> 00:49:33,704
But the people in the village
were very poor...

558
00:49:33,773 --> 00:49:36,674
and every night, they crept
into the house where the girl slept...

559
00:49:36,776 --> 00:49:39,745
and they cut off a piece
of her golden hair...

560
00:49:39,845 --> 00:49:40,937
and they sold it for money.

561
00:49:41,047 --> 00:49:44,346
"She'll never even notice,"
they said.

562
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:47,078
And so, all the gold
was gone from her head.

563
00:49:47,953 --> 00:49:50,387
It's a real Cinderella story.

564
00:49:55,494 --> 00:49:58,190
Tell him to hurry.
Where's my tickets?

565
00:49:58,297 --> 00:49:59,559
You are wired.

566
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:04,394
Here.
Try some of this.

567
00:50:05,737 --> 00:50:07,705
What? What is it?

568
00:50:07,773 --> 00:50:10,970
The answer to all your prayers.

569
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:55,546
The only thing you have to remember
is that it's not about you.

570
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,323
It's not about you.
It's not you that they're looking at.

571
00:51:00,491 --> 00:51:02,550
It's not about you.

572
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:06,288
I'm on top of that.
I understand that.

573
00:51:06,497 --> 00:51:09,557
Honey, that's good.
I'm so glad about that.

574
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:14,568
Because if you let it be about you,
you're screwed, you know.

575
00:51:14,772 --> 00:51:18,071
So, you have to stay separate
from what's happening...

576
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:21,173
and you have to be somewhere else.

577
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:25,241
But I don't know where
that somewhere else is, you know?

578
00:51:25,348 --> 00:51:27,179
Or how to do that.

579
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:31,152
Honey, you can do
whatever you want now.

580
00:51:31,454 --> 00:51:33,820
Yeah? What is it I want?

581
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:35,858
What do I want?

582
00:51:50,073 --> 00:51:55,010
I will be king,
and you will be queen.

583
00:52:06,221 --> 00:52:09,122
I don't think a woman
is really a woman...

584
00:52:09,224 --> 00:52:11,317
unless she's a blonde, you know.

585
00:52:12,561 --> 00:52:15,529
Response is so enormous.

586
00:52:15,564 --> 00:52:18,158
I've never seen anything like it.

587
00:52:18,267 --> 00:52:20,599
And so fast, huh?

588
00:52:21,203 --> 00:52:24,001
About a million people
want to shoot you this month.

589
00:52:24,072 --> 00:52:26,870
We're going to name
a whole phone line after you.

590
00:52:29,044 --> 00:52:31,672
I could learn photography.

591
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:33,907
That could be something I want.

592
00:52:34,015 --> 00:52:36,882
I could photograph children.

593
00:52:36,952 --> 00:52:39,682
I could have my own children.

594
00:52:39,788 --> 00:52:42,985
I would give them yellow roses.

595
00:52:43,091 --> 00:52:47,687
And if they got too loud,
I would just put them someplace quiet.

596
00:52:48,897 --> 00:52:50,797
I'd put them in the oven.

597
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:54,164
And I would kiss them every day...

598
00:52:56,671 --> 00:52:59,572
and tell them,
"You don't have to be anybody...

599
00:52:59,874 --> 00:53:04,777
because I would know, being somebody
doesn't make you anybody anyway. "

600
00:53:07,748 --> 00:53:09,978
You will always be somebody to me.

601
00:53:13,587 --> 00:53:17,353
And on the financial front, with the
sudden illness of Wilhelmina Cooper...

602
00:53:17,424 --> 00:53:19,391
who's still hospitalized
in Manhattan...

603
00:53:19,426 --> 00:53:23,988
models and agents are competing
for the top talent and highest fees.

604
00:53:24,064 --> 00:53:26,191
With the latest news about inflation,
bonds rallied today...

605
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:29,201
in reaction
to the president's speech.

606
00:53:29,303 --> 00:53:30,565
More news in a moment.

607
00:53:34,107 --> 00:53:37,543
She's doing all right. You know,
they're running some more tests.

608
00:53:37,644 --> 00:53:40,044
Maybe in a day or two
we'll know something.

609
00:53:41,548 --> 00:53:43,914
Come on, you gotta help me here.
I'm under a lot of pressure.

610
00:53:44,017 --> 00:53:45,951
I can't give you any answers.

611
00:53:49,489 --> 00:53:51,389
I was thinking a lot
about you lately.

612
00:53:51,491 --> 00:53:54,324
It's terrible, terrible,
isn't it?

613
00:53:54,427 --> 00:53:58,386
Mike Mansfield,
starting up the new Largo Agency.

614
00:53:58,798 --> 00:54:01,232
What do you think
you're gonna do now?

615
00:54:01,734 --> 00:54:03,497
What do you mean?

616
00:54:03,603 --> 00:54:06,163
Well, you're a special girl...

617
00:54:08,207 --> 00:54:09,401
with special problems.

618
00:54:09,508 --> 00:54:12,068
I think you need special attention.

619
00:54:13,245 --> 00:54:15,179
You could go to Ford.

620
00:54:15,247 --> 00:54:19,183
There's always that asshole
over at Elite.

621
00:54:19,551 --> 00:54:22,748
But I think you should put
some serious thought in coming with me.

622
00:54:22,855 --> 00:54:24,846
Why? Why would I leave Wili?

623
00:54:26,959 --> 00:54:30,827
You have to start thinking
about yourself. You have to be tough.

624
00:54:30,896 --> 00:54:34,457
This is a business,
and in this business...

625
00:54:34,533 --> 00:54:37,001
you can't be represented
by a dead woman.

626
00:54:39,838 --> 00:54:40,827
Excuse me.

627
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:44,400
Why don't you give me a call?

628
00:54:47,445 --> 00:54:49,640
Yes, darling, I know
it's so inconvenient.

629
00:54:49,747 --> 00:54:52,910
Get me a copy of the call sheet,
and tell Freddie I need to speak to him.

630
00:54:53,318 --> 00:54:55,513
- Done. I'll take care of it.
- Gia, darling, kiss me.

631
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:58,487
Yes, I have to go too.

632
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:03,687
Have a wonderful trip.
Tell Christian to behave himself.

633
00:55:03,795 --> 00:55:05,695
Ciao, darling.

634
00:55:07,665 --> 00:55:10,600
- I'm exhausted.
- Me too.

635
00:55:12,303 --> 00:55:14,897
Come here, come here, come here.

636
00:55:17,842 --> 00:55:19,673
I thought you were sick.

637
00:55:19,777 --> 00:55:23,645
I am sick, darling,
sick and tired...

638
00:55:23,714 --> 00:55:26,205
but it's not serious.

639
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:31,215
- I'm tired too.
- You?

640
00:55:31,622 --> 00:55:32,953
Yeah.

641
00:55:33,057 --> 00:55:36,549
I think I wanna stop for a while.

642
00:55:36,627 --> 00:55:38,959
You know,
I need some time to think.

643
00:55:39,463 --> 00:55:43,399
Yes, but not now, darling.

644
00:55:43,767 --> 00:55:48,329
Plenty of time to rest
when you're in the ground.

645
00:55:49,106 --> 00:55:51,006
You have...

646
00:55:51,108 --> 00:55:54,635
the whole world...

647
00:55:54,744 --> 00:55:57,679
at your fingertips.

648
00:55:57,747 --> 00:56:03,083
You have to be strong.
Seize the moment.

649
00:56:04,454 --> 00:56:07,423
Because if you don't...

650
00:56:07,624 --> 00:56:10,149
there's always another girl
waiting right behind you...

651
00:56:10,226 --> 00:56:13,161
breathing over your shoulder.

652
00:56:19,035 --> 00:56:20,593
Come on.

653
00:56:21,871 --> 00:56:25,204
I know. I know it's hard.

654
00:56:25,308 --> 00:56:27,242
We can do it.

655
00:56:29,278 --> 00:56:31,542
You and I together.

656
00:56:43,158 --> 00:56:45,888
She really looked dead, didn't she?

657
00:56:45,994 --> 00:56:48,121
The great thing about the afterlife
is nobody cares how you look.

658
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:49,822
Like an average girl.

659
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,891
Too rich and too thin.

660
00:56:55,070 --> 00:57:00,235
- I had no idea she was that sick.
- You can never tell with Germans.

661
00:57:28,769 --> 00:57:30,202
God!

662
00:58:20,686 --> 00:58:23,519
Great. That's beautiful.

663
00:58:23,623 --> 00:58:25,215
Really nice. Cool.

664
00:58:25,458 --> 00:58:27,892
Can you roll your eyes back a little
so we can see the white under them?

665
00:58:28,127 --> 00:58:31,119
- We're going for the seppuku look.
- What is that?

666
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:34,529
Japanese. Sorry, it means
that you're half dead.

667
00:58:34,634 --> 00:58:36,898
- I'm there.
- I know, it's great.

668
00:58:36,969 --> 00:58:40,928
You are doing so good.

669
00:58:42,475 --> 00:58:43,737
Really, you look super.

670
00:58:46,112 --> 00:58:48,080
Oh, my God.
Did you almost just throw up?

671
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:50,605
I'm really sick.

672
00:58:50,682 --> 00:58:54,641
- Can you go make a run downtown for me?
- Don't throw up on this dress.

673
00:58:54,887 --> 00:58:57,378
Just- I'm sick.
Go downtown.

674
00:58:57,489 --> 00:59:01,585
All right? There's a taco place,
and you ask for Satellite or Rich Boy.

675
00:59:01,827 --> 00:59:03,886
Okay? Yeah?

676
00:59:03,996 --> 00:59:06,294
- Chasing the dragon, are you?
- I'm sorry.

677
00:59:06,365 --> 00:59:10,563
Oh, no, it works, it works.
A little death around the eyes.

678
00:59:11,069 --> 00:59:15,563
Okay, great. Fabulous.
Great. Good.

679
00:59:15,874 --> 00:59:18,399
That's really great.
Oh, that's great.

680
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:27,077
Fantastic. Right by the bike.
Good. Bad girl, bad girl.

681
00:59:27,352 --> 00:59:29,047
Good.

682
00:59:31,522 --> 00:59:32,887
Yeah, that's it. Great.

683
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:36,448
Good. Fantastic.

684
00:59:36,561 --> 00:59:40,429
- She's out of her fucking mind?
- Could Cheryl Tiegs do this?

685
00:59:40,831 --> 00:59:42,799
I don't think so.

686
00:59:44,802 --> 00:59:46,167
Go.

687
00:59:55,712 --> 01:00:00,649
Hey, wait!
Hey, where you going?

688
01:01:24,322 --> 01:01:26,992
Hey, where's Satellite?
Is he here?

689
01:01:31,329 --> 01:01:32,747
Come here.

690
01:01:33,999 --> 01:01:35,417
Fuck.

691
01:02:07,574 --> 01:02:08,700
Hey, you bitch.

692
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:44,861
Where's Satellite?

693
01:02:46,822 --> 01:02:48,782
Where is Satellite?

694
01:02:52,285 --> 01:02:57,749
I am sick, fucking junkies.
I'm sick! Where is he?

695
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:00,377
He's making a delivery.

696
01:03:02,796 --> 01:03:07,384
- Is anybody holding anything? Please!
- I'll give you my shot.

697
01:03:09,803 --> 01:03:12,889
I don't shoot. Do you have
anything else dry?

698
01:03:12,973 --> 01:03:14,850
No, man.

699
01:03:14,933 --> 01:03:16,601
All I got is in here.

700
01:03:18,812 --> 01:03:20,397
I can't.

701
01:03:22,899 --> 01:03:25,944
- Okay, if you don't want it.
- Wait.

702
01:03:30,657 --> 01:03:33,160
I want it. You do me.
Will you do it?

703
01:03:38,290 --> 01:03:39,749
Yeah, I'll do you.

704
01:03:56,558 --> 01:03:58,477
This is gonna hurt.

705
01:04:00,729 --> 01:04:02,272
No pain.

706
01:04:05,192 --> 01:04:06,651
Thank you.

707
01:04:09,779 --> 01:04:11,531
Don't be scared, baby.

708
01:04:12,741 --> 01:04:14,242
I'll take you home.

709
01:04:16,953 --> 01:04:18,288
Oh, God.

710
01:05:00,205 --> 01:05:01,706
Oh, my God.

711
01:05:04,167 --> 01:05:06,545
I was thinking about you.

712
01:05:15,262 --> 01:05:16,972
Are you okay?

713
01:05:22,227 --> 01:05:24,187
Is your boyfriend here?

714
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:27,941
I don't have a boyfriend anymore.

715
01:05:38,952 --> 01:05:40,328
I'm all dirty.

716
01:06:13,862 --> 01:06:16,615
I was afraid of the drugs.

717
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:19,075
The way people use them.

718
01:06:19,159 --> 01:06:21,661
I told her that.
I mean, she knew that.

719
01:06:22,746 --> 01:06:25,040
I was afraid of a lot of things.

720
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:28,710
But she promised...

721
01:06:29,252 --> 01:06:31,046
and I believed her.

722
01:06:31,129 --> 01:06:35,133
And I believed
we could make things work.

723
01:06:35,258 --> 01:06:38,970
I believed because we both
wanted it so much that we could.

724
01:06:39,095 --> 01:06:40,764
We could-

725
01:06:43,767 --> 01:06:45,143
And we did.

726
01:06:46,853 --> 01:06:48,772
We did make it work.

727
01:07:40,782 --> 01:07:42,742
You're coming home?

728
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:45,328
Just out of the blue
you're coming home?

729
01:07:45,453 --> 01:07:47,330
Just like that you call me?

730
01:07:49,791 --> 01:07:51,918
You are a piece of work,
you are.

731
01:07:52,043 --> 01:07:54,045
Philadelphia?

732
01:07:54,129 --> 01:07:56,673
The bitch is in Philadelphia?

733
01:07:56,798 --> 01:08:00,468
I'm killing myself
trying to keep this agency alive...

734
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:02,262
which is not easy...

735
01:08:02,387 --> 01:08:07,017
since my wife with her dying breath
screwed me out of 50% of the company.

736
01:08:07,142 --> 01:08:09,394
Fucking women.

737
01:08:09,978 --> 01:08:11,938
And now you tell me
this little...

738
01:08:12,814 --> 01:08:15,650
whatever just disappears.

739
01:08:15,734 --> 01:08:18,904
I hope she fucking dies
in Philadelphia.

740
01:08:22,032 --> 01:08:23,992
It's a 21-day program.

741
01:08:24,242 --> 01:08:28,455
It's your responsibility to come in
every day and take the Methodone.

742
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,252
All right.
Drink the water.

743
01:08:35,337 --> 01:08:36,963
That's all right.

744
01:08:37,047 --> 01:08:39,174
I need you to drink the water.

745
01:08:44,346 --> 01:08:47,057
And sign next to the line.

746
01:08:58,318 --> 01:08:59,986
Okay.

747
01:09:02,739 --> 01:09:04,783
Dwayne King.

748
01:09:05,659 --> 01:09:08,703
There you are, Mr. Doodiekins.
Fresh from the oven.

749
01:09:08,829 --> 01:09:10,539
Thank you, Mrs. Doodiekins.

750
01:09:21,424 --> 01:09:23,134
I could do this,
you know that?

751
01:09:23,218 --> 01:09:25,387
I could be a fucking housewife.

752
01:09:25,512 --> 01:09:27,180
I'd be very happy.

753
01:10:04,718 --> 01:10:07,596
It's very depressing,
this apartment.

754
01:10:07,637 --> 01:10:10,474
All right, all right.
"Shut up, Mom. "

755
01:10:10,599 --> 01:10:12,476
So, is Linda coming back tonight...

756
01:10:12,601 --> 01:10:14,478
or is she staying in New York?

757
01:10:14,603 --> 01:10:17,314
I don't know.
If she works late, she's gonna stay.

758
01:10:18,815 --> 01:10:22,903
I hate what this Methodone
is doing to your shoulders.

759
01:10:22,986 --> 01:10:26,573
They used to stand up so straight,
so beautiful.

760
01:10:26,656 --> 01:10:28,366
Come on.

761
01:10:34,581 --> 01:10:37,584
Well, you have to watch
your weight too.

762
01:10:37,876 --> 01:10:40,170
You want to look good
for when you go back to work.

763
01:10:42,339 --> 01:10:44,257
- I'm not going back to work.
- Okay.

764
01:10:44,341 --> 01:10:46,009
- I can't.
- All right.

765
01:10:46,092 --> 01:10:48,053
Do you understand that?

766
01:10:49,346 --> 01:10:52,015
That's up to you, you know.

767
01:10:52,098 --> 01:10:54,351
But just wait. You'll see.

768
01:11:03,527 --> 01:11:06,363
Hi, this is Linda.
I'm not here. Leave a message.

769
01:11:07,197 --> 01:11:09,074
Hi, Doo-doo. It's me.

770
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:11,952
I've been calling all night.
Where are you?

771
01:11:13,453 --> 01:11:15,497
- Linda?
- Hello?

772
01:11:16,665 --> 01:11:20,502
- Who's this?
- This is Billy. Who's this?

773
01:11:31,179 --> 01:11:34,432
Damn it!
Goddamn it, Gia!

774
01:11:35,725 --> 01:11:38,645
Oh, my God,
she broke into my house.

775
01:11:38,937 --> 01:11:41,815
She stole some money.

776
01:11:41,898 --> 01:11:44,943
She stole jewelry.
She bought the drugs...

777
01:11:45,026 --> 01:11:47,821
and then she took off in the car
like a crazy person.

778
01:11:47,904 --> 01:11:50,365
It was unbelievable.

779
01:11:50,448 --> 01:11:52,367
She took my wedding ring!

780
01:11:52,450 --> 01:11:55,370
- Stop the vehicle and pull over.
- And the lies.

781
01:11:55,996 --> 01:11:59,916
You know that old joke, how you
can tell when a junkie is lying?

782
01:12:00,417 --> 01:12:02,335
Her lips are moving.

783
01:12:03,253 --> 01:12:05,172
It's not funny.

784
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:18,393
Get out of the car.

785
01:12:20,729 --> 01:12:22,898
- Why are you chasing me? Are you crazy?
- Lady-

786
01:12:23,023 --> 01:12:25,442
I'm trying to get to New York,
and you're fucking chasing me?

787
01:12:25,525 --> 01:12:27,944
- All right, ma'am. Calm down.
- What is wrong with you?

788
01:12:28,069 --> 01:12:30,447
- God! What?
- Ma'am?

789
01:12:30,989 --> 01:12:34,784
What the- Just back off, okay?
God!

790
01:12:34,826 --> 01:12:37,078
- Ma'am?
- I have to go.

791
01:12:42,501 --> 01:12:44,461
Get fucking arrested for nothing,
that's why.

792
01:12:44,711 --> 01:12:47,130
These are serious charges.
Reckless driving.

793
01:12:47,506 --> 01:12:50,967
- This is resisting arrest.
- Goddamn it! It's not my fault!

794
01:12:51,009 --> 01:12:52,469
It was not my fault either!

795
01:12:52,594 --> 01:12:54,471
He was there getting some stuff
out of my apartment!

796
01:12:54,596 --> 01:12:57,265
I wasn't even there!
I was on my way back here!

797
01:12:59,643 --> 01:13:02,187
Thank God, because otherwise,
you'd still be in jail.

798
01:13:02,270 --> 01:13:04,189
I have to go back to work.

799
01:13:04,606 --> 01:13:06,650
I know what you're gonna say,
but I need the money.

800
01:13:07,859 --> 01:13:09,820
Stop it!

801
01:13:09,903 --> 01:13:13,907
I need the money so I can be with you,
because I cannot live like this.

802
01:13:13,990 --> 01:13:16,827
Okay? I can't live like this.

803
01:13:17,202 --> 01:13:19,287
And I can't live without you.

804
01:13:20,914 --> 01:13:22,457
You want to come to Largo now.

805
01:13:25,001 --> 01:13:27,128
Is that because everyone else
is afraid of signing you?

806
01:13:27,212 --> 01:13:29,214
No, I haven't asked anyone else.

807
01:13:29,714 --> 01:13:31,591
Then why me?

808
01:13:32,467 --> 01:13:34,427
Because you're a greedy fuck...

809
01:13:34,553 --> 01:13:37,639
and you'll get me more money
than anyone else.

810
01:13:37,681 --> 01:13:39,391
That's the truth.

811
01:13:43,728 --> 01:13:46,690
So, let me be truthful with you.

812
01:13:49,985 --> 01:13:52,904
Everyone's aware of the drug problem.

813
01:13:53,029 --> 01:13:54,281
You weren't very discreet.

814
01:13:55,282 --> 01:13:57,701
Well, I'm clean now...

815
01:13:57,784 --> 01:14:00,078
and I want to work.

816
01:14:06,334 --> 01:14:08,253
Let me see your arms.

817
01:14:10,839 --> 01:14:13,300
It's not my arms you want.
It's my face...

818
01:14:13,550 --> 01:14:15,343
and my tits.

819
01:14:15,927 --> 01:14:17,721
And they're fine.

820
01:14:23,268 --> 01:14:25,187
We're doing a television piece
on models.

821
01:14:25,687 --> 01:14:28,064
I want you to be in it.

822
01:14:28,190 --> 01:14:32,027
I want you to look more beautiful...

823
01:14:32,110 --> 01:14:34,779
than you have ever looked.

824
01:14:34,905 --> 01:14:37,657
And I want you to tell the world...

825
01:14:38,658 --> 01:14:42,996
that you once had a drug problem
and now you don't.

826
01:14:43,413 --> 01:14:46,082
Now you're a good little girl.

827
01:14:49,586 --> 01:14:51,379
If you do that...

828
01:14:52,756 --> 01:14:54,549
we have a deal.

829
01:15:03,809 --> 01:15:05,185
Okay.

830
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:10,398
Good.

831
01:15:15,195 --> 01:15:17,197
- I can't do this.
- Yes, you can.

832
01:15:17,322 --> 01:15:19,241
I'm a model. I don't talk.

833
01:15:19,324 --> 01:15:22,244
I'm not supposed to talk.
I'm supposed to just look beautiful.

834
01:15:23,328 --> 01:15:25,163
You are beautiful.

835
01:15:26,122 --> 01:15:28,250
You make me beautiful.

836
01:15:28,333 --> 01:15:30,043
Hello.

837
01:15:30,126 --> 01:15:31,920
Okay. We're all set.

838
01:15:31,962 --> 01:15:34,381
I'm gonna tape you getting made up.
Kind of a before and after thing.

839
01:15:34,464 --> 01:15:36,633
- Great.
- We've also got some interviews...

840
01:15:36,758 --> 01:15:38,927
set up with your friends,
your family, your mother.

841
01:15:39,302 --> 01:15:41,346
You're gonna
put my mother on tape?

842
01:15:41,429 --> 01:15:44,724
- Yes, most definitely.
- Well, that should be interesting.

843
01:15:47,769 --> 01:15:50,272
- You ready?
- Yeah.

844
01:15:50,564 --> 01:15:51,648
Good.

845
01:15:52,816 --> 01:15:55,569
- I just have to go to the bathroom.
- Sure.

846
01:15:56,945 --> 01:15:59,322
Why don't you guys come over here?
This is what I want.

847
01:16:47,496 --> 01:16:50,415
And how did things first start
for you in modeling?

848
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:55,754
I started working
with very good people.

849
01:16:55,837 --> 01:16:59,132
A lot of them.
Very fast, you know?

850
01:16:59,216 --> 01:17:03,386
I didn't build
into being a model.

851
01:17:03,470 --> 01:17:05,806
I just sort of became one.

852
01:17:05,889 --> 01:17:08,350
How has that affected you?

853
01:17:11,269 --> 01:17:14,314
When you're young,
you don't always know.

854
01:17:15,273 --> 01:17:19,528
It's hard to make out
the difference between...

855
01:17:19,611 --> 01:17:22,197
what's real and what is not real.

856
01:17:24,366 --> 01:17:26,952
At one point you...

857
01:17:27,035 --> 01:17:29,871
kind of got into
the drug scene, didn't you?

858
01:17:34,334 --> 01:17:37,295
Yes, you could say that I did.

859
01:17:37,379 --> 01:17:39,631
But you're free of it now,
aren't you?

860
01:17:41,383 --> 01:17:43,844
Definitely, I'm free of it.

861
01:17:43,927 --> 01:17:47,347
I wouldn't be here right now
talking to all of you if I wasn't.

862
01:17:47,848 --> 01:17:49,808
Are you happy with your success?

863
01:17:53,562 --> 01:17:55,689
Are you happy with your success?

864
01:17:55,939 --> 01:17:57,649
I am.

865
01:17:58,859 --> 01:18:01,570
Yes. Yeah.

866
01:18:03,238 --> 01:18:04,823
You hesitated.

867
01:18:06,741 --> 01:18:10,787
I just wanted to think about it.
But, no, I'm definitely happy with it.

868
01:18:10,912 --> 01:18:13,248
Good. Thank you.

869
01:18:13,331 --> 01:18:15,292
Yeah, thank you.

870
01:18:37,898 --> 01:18:40,901
Fuck! What the fuck?

871
01:18:41,943 --> 01:18:44,821
I, like, kicked Spider-Man's ass!

872
01:18:50,911 --> 01:18:52,412
I'm sorry.

873
01:19:00,253 --> 01:19:02,005
I just wanted to make you smile.

874
01:19:09,221 --> 01:19:10,764
Okay.

875
01:19:10,972 --> 01:19:13,475
Okay, I'm going.
Last chance.

876
01:19:15,769 --> 01:19:18,563
I'm leaving
through the front door.

877
01:19:18,647 --> 01:19:20,565
I can't do this.

878
01:19:20,649 --> 01:19:22,567
Don't say that.
Just say you'll see me tomorrow.

879
01:19:22,651 --> 01:19:25,529
- No, you won't see me tomorrow.
- Don't say that!

880
01:19:27,656 --> 01:19:30,534
We had a deal.
We made a bargain.

881
01:19:35,497 --> 01:19:37,040
I love you.

882
01:19:39,084 --> 01:19:40,752
No, you don't.

883
01:19:42,504 --> 01:19:44,840
All right, I don't.
I don't.

884
01:19:48,468 --> 01:19:51,805
What are you, huh?
You some kind of fucking policeman?

885
01:19:52,097 --> 01:19:54,683
You going to judge me?
I did one fucking line.

886
01:19:55,016 --> 01:19:56,935
One line.

887
01:19:57,185 --> 01:19:59,312
What is the big deal?

888
01:19:59,437 --> 01:20:02,399
What about yesterday?
What about the day before?

889
01:20:07,154 --> 01:20:08,655
Nothing.

890
01:20:09,197 --> 01:20:11,116
I did nothing. I promise.

891
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:13,160
Please don't leave me.

892
01:20:13,243 --> 01:20:15,162
I don't believe you.

893
01:20:18,790 --> 01:20:21,626
You don't believe me because
you don't want to believe me, do you?

894
01:20:21,710 --> 01:20:24,588
Because you don't care!
Because you just wanted to say...

895
01:20:24,671 --> 01:20:26,590
"I'm fucking a model!"

896
01:20:27,632 --> 01:20:29,384
You don't care about me
at all, do you?

897
01:20:29,634 --> 01:20:33,138
Do you? Tell me you don't care!
Say, "I don't care!"

898
01:20:54,117 --> 01:20:56,828
Please. I'm sorry.

899
01:20:58,497 --> 01:21:01,458
I need you so much.
Don't make me do this.

900
01:21:04,419 --> 01:21:06,379
I don't make you do anything.

901
01:21:06,505 --> 01:21:08,381
I wish I could.

902
01:21:09,508 --> 01:21:11,051
You could.

903
01:21:14,679 --> 01:21:16,598
You could take care of me.

904
01:21:25,315 --> 01:21:27,067
Do you have $30?

905
01:21:31,571 --> 01:21:33,615
I don't have any money.

906
01:21:33,907 --> 01:21:35,659
I don't know why.
I never have it.

907
01:21:35,909 --> 01:21:37,661
I never have any money.

908
01:21:42,999 --> 01:21:44,876
In my sock.

909
01:22:01,768 --> 01:22:04,980
- This is what makes you do everything.
- No, it doesn't.

910
01:22:05,105 --> 01:22:07,774
It's not me. It's not you.
It's this.

911
01:22:08,066 --> 01:22:09,776
This shit holds you.

912
01:22:12,070 --> 01:22:14,573
- You choose.
- Come on.

913
01:22:15,824 --> 01:22:18,785
This or me.

914
01:22:31,548 --> 01:22:33,049
Your finger.

915
01:22:35,594 --> 01:22:37,095
Your knees.

916
01:22:41,099 --> 01:22:42,434
Your skin.

917
01:22:43,894 --> 01:22:45,395
Your toes.

918
01:22:56,031 --> 01:22:57,657
I love you.

919
01:24:48,059 --> 01:24:49,728
Change.

920
01:25:15,795 --> 01:25:17,756
She is over.

921
01:25:19,633 --> 01:25:21,551
It's just a question
of time now.

922
01:25:28,809 --> 01:25:30,435
Hey, come on.

923
01:25:33,814 --> 01:25:36,608
- Hi.
- Yes, you are.

924
01:25:36,733 --> 01:25:38,610
You dropped this, honey.

925
01:25:40,153 --> 01:25:42,739
You want to come on and finish
this fiasco?

926
01:25:53,375 --> 01:25:55,293
You look so pretty.

927
01:26:01,007 --> 01:26:02,467
Thanks.

928
01:26:04,386 --> 01:26:05,929
I love you.

929
01:26:08,014 --> 01:26:10,308
I know.
You love everybody.

930
01:26:17,774 --> 01:26:19,985
Gia, listen to me.
I am trying to get you work.

931
01:26:20,235 --> 01:26:22,779
But it's all spring stuff now.

932
01:26:22,863 --> 01:26:26,074
Everybody wants the blonds
with the suntans and the sundresses.

933
01:26:26,199 --> 01:26:28,952
I'm sorry.
No, your look is not spring.

934
01:26:29,035 --> 01:26:31,163
Your look is more like nuclear
fucking winter, and nobody wants it.

935
01:26:31,288 --> 01:26:33,665
Hang up the phone.

936
01:26:33,748 --> 01:26:35,667
I am so tense.

937
01:26:35,750 --> 01:26:38,461
Ron, can you use some of
those fucking muscles?

938
01:26:40,297 --> 01:26:41,631
I'm so tense.

939
01:26:43,008 --> 01:26:47,304
"When she kisses me, I feel
all four winds blow at my face.

940
01:26:47,679 --> 01:26:51,892
But what do you do with a woman
who has no love for you?

941
01:27:00,192 --> 01:27:02,944
She is my lost captive...

942
01:27:03,028 --> 01:27:06,448
and no longer lies
along my legs. "

943
01:27:10,368 --> 01:27:12,329
I wrote that for you.

944
01:27:54,996 --> 01:27:58,834
- Why did they send her out?
- Because I asked for her.

945
01:27:58,917 --> 01:28:00,418
- All right?
- All right.

946
01:28:11,763 --> 01:28:13,640
We use them up...

947
01:28:14,599 --> 01:28:16,560
throw them away.

948
01:28:24,776 --> 01:28:26,611
Where's my knife?

949
01:28:26,736 --> 01:28:28,822
I haven't seen it.

950
01:28:28,947 --> 01:28:30,866
Who took my fucking knife?

951
01:28:32,617 --> 01:28:35,620
Do I look like a fucking terrorist?
Is this funny?

952
01:28:35,745 --> 01:28:39,583
What the fuck is wrong with you people?
Get the fuck away from me!

953
01:28:40,041 --> 01:28:43,086
Get away!
Where's my knife?

954
01:28:45,797 --> 01:28:47,424
Here it is.

955
01:28:52,387 --> 01:28:54,347
You know, you can't do that.

956
01:28:54,473 --> 01:28:56,558
You can't take somebody's knife
when they need it!

957
01:28:56,641 --> 01:28:59,269
It's all right. It's fine.

958
01:29:00,937 --> 01:29:03,940
- Look at those tracks on her arms.
- Okay, now.

959
01:29:04,024 --> 01:29:06,067
And that awful thing
on her hand.

960
01:29:06,151 --> 01:29:08,195
- It looks like a volcano.
- All right.

961
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:14,159
Try folding your arms.

962
01:29:17,871 --> 01:29:19,831
Put them in back of you.

963
01:29:20,874 --> 01:29:22,834
Well, you've almost got it.

964
01:29:22,918 --> 01:29:24,961
Now, try sitting on your hands.

965
01:29:27,672 --> 01:29:29,049
Yes, yes.

966
01:29:31,343 --> 01:29:33,011
You look wonderful.

967
01:29:34,971 --> 01:29:36,640
Beautiful.

968
01:29:50,362 --> 01:29:53,156
- Francesco?
- Yes, sweetheart?

969
01:29:54,407 --> 01:29:56,117
Thank you.

970
01:29:58,912 --> 01:30:03,166
Gia, this is life, not heaven.

971
01:30:03,250 --> 01:30:05,168
You don't have to be perfect.

972
01:30:07,254 --> 01:30:10,841
Look at me. Where's those eyes?
Where's the mouth?

973
01:30:11,466 --> 01:30:14,719
What? You're not!

974
01:30:14,803 --> 01:30:16,721
Truly? You're on an airplane?

975
01:30:17,722 --> 01:30:19,349
Oh, my God! Listen to me!

976
01:30:19,474 --> 01:30:21,643
I'm so excited! I'm yelling!

977
01:30:21,726 --> 01:30:23,645
I don't have to yell, do I?

978
01:30:23,728 --> 01:30:26,565
- No, you don't have to yell.
- Henry!

979
01:30:26,690 --> 01:30:29,860
- Mom, I don't want to talk to Henry.
- Where is he? Hold on.

980
01:30:31,611 --> 01:30:33,405
Where are you?

981
01:30:33,488 --> 01:30:35,407
I mean, where is the airplane?

982
01:30:35,490 --> 01:30:38,410
I've never talked to anybody
on an airplane before.

983
01:30:39,953 --> 01:30:41,913
I was in Paris...

984
01:30:42,289 --> 01:30:44,541
and I think
I'm going to Munich.

985
01:30:45,709 --> 01:30:47,419
I don't know.

986
01:30:49,004 --> 01:30:50,922
I don't feel so good.

987
01:30:52,716 --> 01:30:55,510
Well, honey, you're probably
just tired, you know?

988
01:30:56,553 --> 01:30:57,888
Yeah...

989
01:30:58,013 --> 01:30:59,931
and I'm cold.

990
01:31:02,809 --> 01:31:04,728
You know...

991
01:31:05,937 --> 01:31:08,773
I was thinking about
coming home again.

992
01:31:09,357 --> 01:31:11,067
What do you think?

993
01:31:16,406 --> 01:31:18,992
Honey, I don't think so.

994
01:31:20,118 --> 01:31:21,953
You know?

995
01:31:26,416 --> 01:31:30,962
I mean, you know,
after the last time.

996
01:31:31,463 --> 01:31:33,673
Yeah, I know. Of course.

997
01:31:45,602 --> 01:31:47,020
I'm sorry.

998
01:31:51,233 --> 01:31:52,776
Yeah.

999
01:31:57,489 --> 01:31:59,032
I better go.

1000
01:32:00,575 --> 01:32:02,536
All right. Okay.

1001
01:32:03,119 --> 01:32:04,579
Listen to me.

1002
01:32:05,121 --> 01:32:07,165
Now, you take care of yourself.

1003
01:32:07,541 --> 01:32:09,292
Okay?

1004
01:32:09,543 --> 01:32:11,628
You call me.

1005
01:32:11,753 --> 01:32:13,755
Because I love you.

1006
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:17,175
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

1007
01:33:18,570 --> 01:33:21,364
Every model has a moment-

1008
01:33:21,406 --> 01:33:23,366
I mean, the ones who
make it at all-

1009
01:33:23,450 --> 01:33:25,368
and whether or not
they can parlay that moment...

1010
01:33:25,452 --> 01:33:28,371
into some kind of a career-

1011
01:33:28,497 --> 01:33:30,540
well, that's the gamble,
isn't it?

1012
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:33,543
'Cause the moment
is a very short time.

1013
01:33:33,627 --> 01:33:36,046
It's here and then it's gone,
just like most of these girls.

1014
01:33:36,338 --> 01:33:38,256
They're here...

1015
01:33:38,381 --> 01:33:40,258
and then they're gone.

1016
01:33:44,179 --> 01:33:46,181
When she came back to New York...

1017
01:33:46,264 --> 01:33:48,517
I was in Philadelphia.

1018
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:51,394
And I heard some things.

1019
01:33:51,478 --> 01:33:53,897
A lot of things.

1020
01:33:53,980 --> 01:33:56,066
So I took the train
up to see her.

1021
01:34:18,672 --> 01:34:20,590
I can't find my money.

1022
01:34:21,758 --> 01:34:25,137
- What?
- I had $600, and I can't find it.

1023
01:34:35,272 --> 01:34:36,815
What's going on?

1024
01:34:37,065 --> 01:34:39,025
I can't find my money!

1025
01:34:40,235 --> 01:34:41,736
What's wrong with you?

1026
01:34:43,071 --> 01:34:45,198
What are you doing?

1027
01:34:45,282 --> 01:34:48,702
- Do you have any money?
- No, I don't have any money.

1028
01:34:50,787 --> 01:34:52,747
You want to fuck me?

1029
01:34:54,708 --> 01:34:56,710
You give me money,
I'll let you fuck me.

1030
01:34:59,796 --> 01:35:02,424
- Come here.
- What?

1031
01:35:05,177 --> 01:35:07,137
Get off! What?

1032
01:35:09,598 --> 01:35:11,516
- Can I please hold you?
- Get off!

1033
01:35:12,726 --> 01:35:14,269
No drugs.

1034
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:17,147
Get off of me!

1035
01:35:17,981 --> 01:35:19,566
- Calm down.
- Okay.

1036
01:35:38,335 --> 01:35:40,587
Okay, do you have
any medical insurance?

1037
01:35:42,881 --> 01:35:46,426
- Can you pay cash for this?
- No, I don't have any money.

1038
01:35:49,721 --> 01:35:51,681
Stupid question.

1039
01:35:53,892 --> 01:35:56,394
All right. You'll have to
declare yourself indigent.

1040
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:58,396
Do you understand that?

1041
01:36:39,479 --> 01:36:41,189
Wait a minute.

1042
01:36:41,273 --> 01:36:45,694
What, am I supposed to feel sorry
for you because you're beautiful?

1043
01:36:45,735 --> 01:36:50,282
Because you made 10,000 a minute
doing fucking nothing?

1044
01:36:50,365 --> 01:36:53,702
"Oh, it was so hard,
so terrible.

1045
01:36:53,785 --> 01:36:55,829
They treated me so bad. "

1046
01:36:55,912 --> 01:36:58,623
Listen, girl.
You had a free ride...

1047
01:36:58,748 --> 01:37:00,625
and you fucking blew it.

1048
01:37:07,757 --> 01:37:09,259
And me?

1049
01:37:09,342 --> 01:37:11,761
I'm some kid from Ohio...

1050
01:37:11,845 --> 01:37:16,224
reading fashion magazines,
looking at your picture and thinking...

1051
01:37:16,308 --> 01:37:18,935
"I'm supposed to look like that"...

1052
01:37:19,186 --> 01:37:22,898
and going fucking crazy
because I don't.

1053
01:37:23,398 --> 01:37:26,234
Because nobody told me
it was a lie.

1054
01:37:26,276 --> 01:37:30,614
Because the magazine doesn't come
with a label that says...

1055
01:37:30,697 --> 01:37:34,701
"Caution. This is a lie.
Nobody looks like this. "

1056
01:37:34,784 --> 01:37:37,537
Not even you.

1057
01:37:46,004 --> 01:37:49,299
Well, they asked me to go
to the sessions, so I did.

1058
01:37:49,424 --> 01:37:50,926
I tried.

1059
01:37:51,885 --> 01:37:54,888
I just got so mad.
I got so mad.

1060
01:37:56,598 --> 01:37:59,935
I said to them, "Look, I'm not
the drug addict here.

1061
01:38:00,018 --> 01:38:03,021
I'm not the one that
you should be ripping apart. "

1062
01:38:04,856 --> 01:38:06,983
I said, "This is all buried.

1063
01:38:07,108 --> 01:38:09,945
Why don't you just let it be?"

1064
01:38:09,986 --> 01:38:12,531
That's what I told 'em.
Look. I know.

1065
01:38:12,823 --> 01:38:15,158
You want to blame somebody.
You want to blame me.

1066
01:38:15,450 --> 01:38:17,619
Okay, go ahead.
Knock yourself out.

1067
01:38:19,454 --> 01:38:21,373
But just remember this:

1068
01:38:21,456 --> 01:38:24,376
Everything I did,
I did because I loved her.

1069
01:38:25,252 --> 01:38:27,170
And I believe
that it was my love...

1070
01:38:27,254 --> 01:38:30,132
and my prayers
that got her through that.

1071
01:38:42,477 --> 01:38:44,813
Hi, Linda. It's Gia.

1072
01:38:44,938 --> 01:38:47,149
I'm calling to apologize.

1073
01:38:48,275 --> 01:38:50,485
I'm in this program...

1074
01:38:50,569 --> 01:38:53,947
and it's, like, part of the program
that we're supposed to...

1075
01:38:54,030 --> 01:38:57,450
ask forgiveness of the people
that we hurt when we were drugging.

1076
01:38:58,493 --> 01:39:02,414
I was, like, "Well, fuck, man.
That could take the rest of my life. "

1077
01:39:06,042 --> 01:39:07,836
I'm sorry.

1078
01:39:07,878 --> 01:39:09,463
This is stupid.

1079
01:39:15,010 --> 01:39:18,722
Anyway, I'm calling
to ask forgiveness...

1080
01:39:18,847 --> 01:39:22,017
and to say that I miss you,
because-

1081
01:39:24,186 --> 01:39:27,022
What is that?
Am I done?

1082
01:39:27,063 --> 01:39:29,900
I think I'm done.
I don't know what happened.

1083
01:39:30,025 --> 01:39:31,776
Hi, it's me.

1084
01:39:40,368 --> 01:39:41,828
Boy, Linda.

1085
01:39:43,955 --> 01:39:45,457
Yeah.

1086
01:39:53,048 --> 01:39:55,300
Well, now I don't know
what to say.

1087
01:39:57,385 --> 01:40:01,181
It's okay. I heard you.
I heard it all.

1088
01:40:02,724 --> 01:40:04,434
Is that okay?

1089
01:40:06,436 --> 01:40:08,396
Yeah.

1090
01:40:18,406 --> 01:40:21,743
I can't talk right now.
I have to go.

1091
01:40:21,785 --> 01:40:23,870
Can I call you in a few days?

1092
01:40:26,873 --> 01:40:29,751
I'm gonna be out in a few days,
and then I'm gonna call you, okay?

1093
01:41:01,908 --> 01:41:03,994
You know how she's
always saying she's a model?

1094
01:41:04,119 --> 01:41:06,204
Oh, my sweet Jesus!

1095
01:41:06,288 --> 01:41:07,956
Is that her?

1096
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:11,084
I wonder if she's been folding
the same pair of jeans...

1097
01:41:11,168 --> 01:41:13,628
for the last five minutes?

1098
01:41:16,423 --> 01:41:18,341
And that's another thing.

1099
01:41:18,425 --> 01:41:20,844
You don't want to work
in a place like that.

1100
01:41:20,927 --> 01:41:23,388
Ugly, ugly place.

1101
01:41:23,472 --> 01:41:25,348
Ugly people.

1102
01:41:25,432 --> 01:41:27,809
Mom, listen.
This is the good part.

1103
01:41:27,934 --> 01:41:29,769
This is good.

1104
01:41:29,895 --> 01:41:33,398
Everything's gonna be
really good from now on, okay?

1105
01:41:41,198 --> 01:41:43,200
Look at this.
Look at your skin.

1106
01:41:44,159 --> 01:41:45,535
Mom.

1107
01:41:45,827 --> 01:41:47,454
What? It's just acne.

1108
01:41:47,537 --> 01:41:49,498
It's okay. It'll go away.

1109
01:41:49,539 --> 01:41:52,292
It's the drugs.
They're coming out of my system.

1110
01:41:52,417 --> 01:41:54,753
I'm gonna look really good.

1111
01:41:54,836 --> 01:41:56,963
And by Christmas,
I'm gonna look great.

1112
01:41:57,088 --> 01:42:00,300
And we are gonna have
the best holiday ever.

1113
01:42:01,676 --> 01:42:03,470
Why don't you come home?

1114
01:42:03,595 --> 01:42:06,556
Move back in with me.
Would you like that?

1115
01:42:13,021 --> 01:42:14,940
I gotta be alone.

1116
01:42:16,733 --> 01:42:20,487
But can you lend me a few bucks
for coffee and toothpaste?

1117
01:42:21,196 --> 01:42:22,531
Oh, the coffee!

1118
01:42:22,823 --> 01:42:25,325
I'm sorry. I forgot.

1119
01:42:26,409 --> 01:42:30,497
With the money you made, you could have
lived the rest of your life.

1120
01:42:31,581 --> 01:42:34,000
Well, that's what happens,
I suppose.

1121
01:42:37,379 --> 01:42:40,006
- What?
- I'm just feeling dizzy.

1122
01:42:40,090 --> 01:42:41,383
- What is it?
- Mom.

1123
01:42:45,428 --> 01:42:48,390
Oh, honey, you're burning up.

1124
01:42:50,559 --> 01:42:53,478
- Why do my ears hurt?
- Oh, baby.

1125
01:42:57,732 --> 01:42:59,276
Oh, my God.

1126
01:43:08,952 --> 01:43:10,328
You have pneumonia...

1127
01:43:10,412 --> 01:43:12,205
which we can treat.

1128
01:43:14,207 --> 01:43:15,876
Gia, listen.

1129
01:43:17,043 --> 01:43:21,089
There's something more serious
going on which caused your infection.

1130
01:43:22,174 --> 01:43:26,094
Something they're calling
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.

1131
01:43:27,220 --> 01:43:29,139
Maybe you heard about it?

1132
01:43:31,808 --> 01:43:33,685
How did I get it?

1133
01:43:33,768 --> 01:43:35,896
Well, we're really
just finding things out...

1134
01:43:36,021 --> 01:43:38,523
and you're the first woman
I've known about.

1135
01:43:38,648 --> 01:43:42,068
Although, intravenous drug users seem
to be in a specially high-risk group.

1136
01:43:42,152 --> 01:43:45,071
So you probably got it
from a contaminated needle.

1137
01:43:46,823 --> 01:43:48,742
How do I get rid of it?

1138
01:44:10,222 --> 01:44:12,808
But how do they know?
They don't know anything about it.

1139
01:44:12,933 --> 01:44:14,893
They know, okay?

1140
01:44:15,018 --> 01:44:16,937
They just know.

1141
01:45:14,619 --> 01:45:17,122
You know what I think?

1142
01:45:17,205 --> 01:45:20,500
I think there's a reason
for everything.

1143
01:45:20,625 --> 01:45:24,296
And I think that there's
a plan for everybody.

1144
01:45:26,047 --> 01:45:28,925
And I think that God...

1145
01:45:29,009 --> 01:45:31,928
has a big plan for me.

1146
01:45:33,013 --> 01:45:35,140
Just not in this life.

1147
01:45:38,977 --> 01:45:41,438
I'm on top of everything.

1148
01:45:41,521 --> 01:45:43,440
I'm super cool.

1149
01:45:45,650 --> 01:45:47,694
Ah, you've gotten better.

1150
01:45:53,533 --> 01:45:55,035
I can't take her home.

1151
01:45:56,369 --> 01:45:59,456
I'm trying, but Henry
is just afraid.

1152
01:46:00,373 --> 01:46:02,292
So what?

1153
01:46:02,375 --> 01:46:04,085
Dr. Blair-

1154
01:46:04,211 --> 01:46:07,005
This is your daughter.
Your daughter.

1155
01:46:07,047 --> 01:46:09,841
So people are scared.
I am scared.

1156
01:46:09,966 --> 01:46:13,303
He's afraid that if people find out,
he could lose his job.

1157
01:46:16,890 --> 01:46:18,850
Fine. Okay, fine.

1158
01:46:22,521 --> 01:46:24,523
And where is she going to go?

1159
01:46:24,648 --> 01:46:28,568
He wants her to go to a hotel.
He says that he'll pay for it.

1160
01:46:30,612 --> 01:46:32,531
Oh, God, listen to me.

1161
01:46:40,247 --> 01:46:42,124
Dr. Bruce, telephone, please.

1162
01:46:54,594 --> 01:46:56,847
What about her father?
Why can't he take her?

1163
01:46:56,930 --> 01:46:59,266
She doesn't want him to know.

1164
01:47:01,935 --> 01:47:04,521
I don't want to lose my baby.

1165
01:47:09,484 --> 01:47:12,362
- Kathleen-
- No, I can't.

1166
01:47:24,749 --> 01:47:26,251
Well...

1167
01:47:26,543 --> 01:47:28,462
you have to understand.

1168
01:47:28,587 --> 01:47:30,505
In those days...

1169
01:47:32,132 --> 01:47:33,800
nobody knew.

1170
01:47:41,516 --> 01:47:43,268
People were scared.

1171
01:47:43,518 --> 01:47:45,270
I was scared.

1172
01:47:47,981 --> 01:47:50,567
She must have been scared too.

1173
01:48:04,414 --> 01:48:08,251
Dear Linda,
this is the end of my book.

1174
01:48:08,335 --> 01:48:11,296
The last page, the last shot.

1175
01:48:11,379 --> 01:48:13,882
Seeing you to say hello
and good-bye.

1176
01:48:14,674 --> 01:48:17,302
Seeing you to fill up
all the empty...

1177
01:48:17,427 --> 01:48:20,138
and smell and touch...

1178
01:48:20,263 --> 01:48:22,265
and leave my kisses
all over your face.

1179
01:48:28,313 --> 01:48:30,899
- That's me.
- Come in.

1180
01:48:37,197 --> 01:48:39,157
Do you want some tea?

1181
01:48:40,075 --> 01:48:43,328
I was so nervous
about seeing you.

1182
01:48:43,411 --> 01:48:45,372
Coffee?

1183
01:48:45,831 --> 01:48:47,958
No, I can't stay long.

1184
01:48:49,042 --> 01:48:50,293
Why not?

1185
01:48:53,630 --> 01:48:55,423
I have an appointment.

1186
01:48:57,676 --> 01:48:59,344
Work?

1187
01:49:01,012 --> 01:49:02,764
No more work for me.

1188
01:49:04,474 --> 01:49:06,977
I just thought
we'd have more time.

1189
01:49:07,060 --> 01:49:09,062
Yeah, me too.

1190
01:49:09,354 --> 01:49:10,689
Just not today.

1191
01:49:10,772 --> 01:49:12,566
That's okay.

1192
01:49:12,691 --> 01:49:16,027
We have all the time in the world.
We'll take it.

1193
01:49:17,404 --> 01:49:18,738
Yeah, I guess so.

1194
01:49:20,657 --> 01:49:23,660
But today I just wanted
to see your face.

1195
01:49:23,785 --> 01:49:25,453
I missed your face.

1196
01:49:39,509 --> 01:49:41,428
What are you going to do?

1197
01:49:44,556 --> 01:49:47,017
I don't know. I have some plans.
I think...

1198
01:49:47,100 --> 01:49:49,436
I might go to school, you know?

1199
01:49:49,519 --> 01:49:51,646
Learn something useful maybe.

1200
01:49:54,149 --> 01:49:57,277
Maybe even settle down
and have some kids, you know?

1201
01:49:57,402 --> 01:49:59,070
What the hell?

1202
01:49:59,154 --> 01:50:00,655
Wow.

1203
01:50:01,448 --> 01:50:03,909
How straight are you now?

1204
01:50:04,034 --> 01:50:06,953
I mean, are we
talking about men?

1205
01:50:08,205 --> 01:50:10,123
You don't need a husband
to have kids.

1206
01:50:13,960 --> 01:50:18,298
And besides, you were the one
who always had my heart, you know?

1207
01:50:23,345 --> 01:50:26,932
Yeah, I guess I did know that.

1208
01:50:32,771 --> 01:50:34,815
Would you keep these for me?

1209
01:50:37,275 --> 01:50:39,152
Your fairy tales?

1210
01:50:39,277 --> 01:50:41,279
Yeah, some. A few.

1211
01:50:42,614 --> 01:50:45,575
Plus all the other
crazy shit in my head.

1212
01:50:47,619 --> 01:50:51,832
I don't want to throw it away.
I just don't want it around right now.

1213
01:50:53,291 --> 01:50:56,294
- You can read it if you want.
- No, I won't.

1214
01:50:56,378 --> 01:51:00,298
No, read it.
I want you to, you know?

1215
01:51:00,423 --> 01:51:02,801
Maybe you can make
some sense out of it.

1216
01:51:02,884 --> 01:51:04,553
I never could.

1217
01:51:10,892 --> 01:51:14,312
- I'm gonna see you again, aren't I?
- Yeah, you want to?

1218
01:51:24,698 --> 01:51:29,411
You know, I was thinking about...

1219
01:51:30,495 --> 01:51:33,623
getting a house at the beach
this summer.

1220
01:51:33,748 --> 01:51:35,125
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1221
01:51:35,208 --> 01:51:38,670
I really thought that
it would give us a chance.

1222
01:51:40,755 --> 01:51:44,342
I would like so much for us
to have another chance.

1223
01:51:47,345 --> 01:51:49,264
Yeah, I'd like that too.

1224
01:51:54,686 --> 01:51:56,021
I gotta go.

1225
01:51:56,229 --> 01:51:58,899
No, wait.
I want you to stay.

1226
01:52:11,453 --> 01:52:15,707
You were the one.
You were the only one.

1227
01:52:16,374 --> 01:52:19,377
And you are amazing.

1228
01:52:33,767 --> 01:52:35,519
She-

1229
01:52:35,644 --> 01:52:38,647
She put together this money.

1230
01:52:39,731 --> 01:52:41,691
She pawned some things...

1231
01:52:41,817 --> 01:52:44,236
borrowed some from her father...

1232
01:52:45,278 --> 01:52:47,864
stole some from Kathleen.

1233
01:52:50,784 --> 01:52:54,788
I didn't know
what she was doing.

1234
01:52:55,163 --> 01:52:56,915
I should have...

1235
01:52:56,957 --> 01:52:58,708
but I didn't.

1236
01:52:58,792 --> 01:53:01,711
It may have crossed my mind.

1237
01:53:03,255 --> 01:53:05,215
I really didn't think
she would do that.

1238
01:53:07,759 --> 01:53:09,845
I really didn't.

1239
01:53:13,098 --> 01:53:15,725
Yo, Gia. How you doing?

1240
01:53:15,851 --> 01:53:17,394
Good. Is he here?

1241
01:53:17,477 --> 01:53:19,312
Yeah, he's in the back.

1242
01:53:25,777 --> 01:53:27,863
How much you want, angel?

1243
01:53:27,946 --> 01:53:30,240
As much as you've got.

1244
01:53:33,285 --> 01:53:36,329
What are you gonna do
with that much stuff?

1245
01:53:37,456 --> 01:53:39,708
Well, that's my business.

1246
01:53:44,629 --> 01:53:47,757
- What, are you holding or not?
- What's your hurry?

1247
01:53:48,967 --> 01:53:50,886
All right. Come on.
Yes or no?

1248
01:53:52,304 --> 01:53:54,806
Yeah, I got what you need...

1249
01:53:54,890 --> 01:53:56,808
and I got it right here.

1250
01:53:57,559 --> 01:53:59,853
Yo, man, what the fuck
are you doing?

1251
01:53:59,936 --> 01:54:02,939
- Look what Santa Claus brought us.
- I'm freaking out of here!

1252
01:54:03,064 --> 01:54:05,442
You get the money.
I'm gonna get mine.

1253
01:54:25,837 --> 01:54:27,756
It's gonna be all right.

1254
01:54:50,737 --> 01:54:52,656
What are you doing here?

1255
01:55:10,006 --> 01:55:12,843
I'm gonna take you home, baby.

1256
01:55:18,557 --> 01:55:21,268
She wouldn't let anybody see her...

1257
01:55:21,351 --> 01:55:23,520
but I went anyway.

1258
01:55:23,645 --> 01:55:25,981
I saw her once.

1259
01:55:27,065 --> 01:55:28,984
But I did see her.

1260
01:55:29,568 --> 01:55:33,488
- I don't think she knew it was me.
- No more than five minutes, okay?

1261
01:55:35,031 --> 01:55:39,494
I couldn't help thinking to myself,
"My God, she's just a kid. "

1262
01:55:40,871 --> 01:55:43,206
I blame myself, you know?

1263
01:55:44,458 --> 01:55:47,377
I mean, these are children.

1264
01:55:48,837 --> 01:55:51,423
No matter how screwed up
our lives may be...

1265
01:55:51,715 --> 01:55:54,468
we've got to take care
of our children.

1266
01:56:08,398 --> 01:56:10,484
She knew she was dying.

1267
01:56:10,734 --> 01:56:13,028
She said she wanted
to do it right.

1268
01:56:13,111 --> 01:56:15,739
She wanted
to get a video camera...

1269
01:56:15,864 --> 01:56:17,866
and do this thing...

1270
01:56:17,991 --> 01:56:20,827
where she talked to kids
about drugs.

1271
01:56:21,787 --> 01:56:23,747
She wanted to tell kids...

1272
01:56:24,748 --> 01:56:26,875
that you can handle it.

1273
01:56:28,627 --> 01:56:30,796
You can handle anything
that comes your way.

1274
01:56:33,381 --> 01:56:35,675
But we never got the camera.

1275
01:56:46,520 --> 01:56:50,690
You do be the prettiest,
prettiest girl.

1276
01:56:51,775 --> 01:56:53,735
You do be that.

1277
01:56:54,611 --> 01:56:56,154
Do I?

1278
01:56:57,072 --> 01:57:00,492
Do I be the prettiest?

1279
01:57:16,883 --> 01:57:19,094
Do you forgive me, Kathleen?

1280
01:57:22,722 --> 01:57:24,349
Oh, honey.

1281
01:57:26,351 --> 01:57:27,561
Oh, yeah.

1282
01:57:33,066 --> 01:57:34,734
Of course I do.

1283
01:57:40,490 --> 01:57:42,909
Because I forgive you too.

1284
01:57:47,164 --> 01:57:48,874
Oh, baby.

1285
01:57:59,801 --> 01:58:01,470
What's this?

1286
01:58:06,725 --> 01:58:08,602
What is it?

1287
01:58:08,685 --> 01:58:10,520
Oh, my God.

1288
01:58:13,982 --> 01:58:15,775
Nurse?

1289
01:58:15,859 --> 01:58:17,903
Where are you going, Mom?

1290
01:58:19,321 --> 01:58:20,989
Mom?

1291
01:58:22,115 --> 01:58:24,034
Where you going?

1292
01:58:31,041 --> 01:58:34,044
She died around
10:00 in the morning.

1293
01:58:34,252 --> 01:58:36,546
They tried to pick her-

1294
01:58:36,671 --> 01:58:39,591
They tried to pick her
up off the bed, and she-

1295
01:58:39,674 --> 01:58:42,427
The flesh just fell off her back.
It just fell off.

1296
01:58:43,553 --> 01:58:45,472
You don't want
to hear about that.

1297
01:58:47,724 --> 01:58:49,684
Okay, what else?

1298
01:58:58,527 --> 01:59:01,530
This is it.
This is what I was looking for.

1299
01:59:03,448 --> 01:59:05,826
"And the people said...

1300
01:59:06,076 --> 01:59:08,703
'Oh, she's not beautiful at all. '

1301
01:59:08,829 --> 01:59:11,081
And they took her from
the beautiful house...

1302
01:59:11,331 --> 01:59:13,834
and they drove her
into the street.

1303
01:59:14,417 --> 01:59:16,920
And she went away...

1304
01:59:17,003 --> 01:59:19,089
and she never came back.

1305
01:59:22,759 --> 01:59:25,262
And soon,
people became hungry again...

1306
01:59:25,387 --> 01:59:27,722
and they went back into
the beautiful house...

1307
01:59:28,140 --> 01:59:31,726
looking for gold,
but there was no one there. "

1308
01:59:33,603 --> 01:59:35,397
They say she knew.

1309
01:59:35,480 --> 01:59:37,774
She really knew.
She knew the whole story.

1310
01:59:41,278 --> 01:59:44,197
We found an undertaker,
and it was hard, believe me.

1311
01:59:44,281 --> 01:59:47,409
You know, because of the AIDS.

1312
01:59:47,993 --> 01:59:50,454
I didn't want people
to remember her like that...

1313
01:59:50,454 --> 01:59:52,873
because I didn't want people
to see her like that.

1314
01:59:52,956 --> 01:59:56,751
I wanted them to remember her
as beautiful...

1315
01:59:56,793 --> 01:59:59,754
because that's what
she really was.

1316
02:00:40,879 --> 02:00:43,131
Life and death...

1317
02:00:43,215 --> 02:00:45,967
energy and peace.

1318
02:00:46,051 --> 02:00:49,054
If I stop today,
it was still worth it.

1319
02:00:49,137 --> 02:00:51,807
Even the terrible mistakes
that I have made...

1320
02:00:51,932 --> 02:00:54,309
and would have unmade
if I could.

1321
02:00:54,976 --> 02:00:58,522
The pains that have burned me
and scarred my soul.

1322
02:00:58,647 --> 02:00:59,981
It was worth it...

1323
02:01:00,065 --> 02:01:02,984
for having been allowed
to walk where I've walked...

1324
02:01:03,068 --> 02:01:05,070
which was to hell on Earth...

1325
02:01:05,153 --> 02:01:07,030
heaven on Earth...

1326
02:01:07,113 --> 02:01:09,950
back again, into, under...

1327
02:01:09,991 --> 02:01:12,828
far in between, through it...

1328
02:01:12,953 --> 02:01:15,080
in it and above.
