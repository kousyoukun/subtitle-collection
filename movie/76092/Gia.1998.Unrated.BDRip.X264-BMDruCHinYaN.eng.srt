1
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:14,334
They say she knew. She really knew. She knew the whole story.

2
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:59,892
At that time, everybody was tall, thin and blonde.

3
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:04,480
Everybody posed, everybody gave you a look.

4
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:07,066
But Gia was different.

5
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:11,153
She was the first one who... Who moved.

6
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:16,992
They all try to do it now, give you an attitude, but she invented it.

7
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:19,578
She always followed her instincts

8
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:23,082
no matter where they took her.

9
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:27,044
It was probably the best and the worst thing about her.

10
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:31,340
with Gia, it was always about the sex.

11
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:36,553
Every look, every move, every minute. Every day.

12
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,015
Sex.

13
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:44,978
They were jealous of her. They still are. That's why they say those things.

14
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:49,942
She would come on to everybody, but it was really innocent.

15
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:53,529
I mean, nobody was ever really offended by it.

16
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,657
I don't think it had anything to do with sex.

17
00:01:57,033 --> 00:02:00,786
Even when she was sleeping around, sex was not the goal.

18
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,288
Sex wasn't really an issue.

19
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,041
Yeah, I knew about the drugs.

20
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:10,838
I was afraid of the drugs, the way people used them.

21
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,048
It all just happened so fast.

22
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,717
You know, all of a sudden, her face was just everywhere.

23
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:20,556
Every model has a moment. I mean, the ones who make it at all.

24
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:24,726
And being of the moment is everything in fashion.

25
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:29,898
Fashion is not art, you know. Fashion isn't even culture.

26
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,860
Fashion is advertising,

27
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:35,404
and advertising is money.

28
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:40,826
And for every dollar you earn, someone has to pay.

29
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:16,486
Once upon a time, once upon a time.

30
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,992
It was a fairy tale.

31
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,038
It was. It was a fairy tale come true.

32
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,710
I had two boys, you know, but boys you lose.

33
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:36,006
They go away, they marry other women. They're gone.

34
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,217
A girl, you have forever.

35
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:42,054
When Gia was born, I said, "This one is mine."

36
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:45,432
- Look at you. - "All mine."

37
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,227
Look at me.

38
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,728
Look at us.

39
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,482
Look how pretty we are.

40
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:58,237
Do I be? Do I be the prettiest, prettiest girl?

41
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:02,616
You do. You do be the prettiest. You do be that.

42
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,374
- Where the hell have you been? - Out.

43
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:14,836
- Out? Out? Out where? - Out.

44
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,421
Joe, don't start.

45
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,715
Don't tell me, "Don't start." Out where? Tell me where you've been.

46
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,260
- Joe, lower your voice. - Don't tell me to lower my voice.

47
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,928
The kids know you haven't been home all night.

48
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,388
- Cut it out! - Tell them where you've been.

49
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,515
I'm not in the mood for this tonight, Joe.

50
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,892
Not in the mood, huh?

51
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,353
- Just leave me alone. - Who were you with, Kathleen?

52
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,437
It's none of your business.

53
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,439
Don't tell me it's none of my business you fucking whore.

54
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,483
- Get out. Get out of the kitchen. - Let me see. Did he fuck you?

55
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:37,818
- Stop! - Let me see. Did he fuck you?

56
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:40,279
- Where? Let me feel! - Pig ! Get your hands off!

57
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,781
- Who else has been in there besides me? - Get your hands off of me, jerk.

58
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,700
- Who else, huh? - You know how you make me feel?

59
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,411
- You make me wanna die. You know that? - You wanna die? No!

60
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,371
You don't die until I tell you you can die.

61
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,456
That's when you die, God damn it, you hear me?

62
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,000
That's when you die!

63
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:09,182
Here, take this and put it in the car. I'll keep this one.

64
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,197
Once upon a time

65
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,784
in a kingdom far, far away

66
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,078
there lived a young girl

67
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,331
whose hair was made of gold.

68
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,250
when the people in the village saw her,

69
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,211
they said, "How beautiful she is."

70
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:42,299
All Right, one cheesesteak, one meatball, one salami- provoIone.

71
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,343
Keep your eye on the shop, I'll be back by 4:00.

72
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,928
Try not to burn the place down huh?

73
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:50,307
- Gia, you're in charge. - All Right, boss.

74
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,812
Hey, get the food, get the food. Go, come on, come on, get outta here.

75
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,149
- Get the cash register. What are you doing? - I'm in charge!

76
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,860
- Hey. - Is your name Gia?

77
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,946
Yeah.

78
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,576
- Got a llght? - Stop screwing around.

79
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,496
I've seen you a few times around the neighborhood and...

80
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,081
Are you nervous?

81
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,458
Yeah.

82
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,002
Am I making you nervous?

83
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,630
Yeah.

84
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,511
Well, good, 'cause that's the idea.

85
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,848
- What's that? - You scare the shit out of people

86
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,601
and then they don't see how scared you are.

87
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,188
Are you scared?

88
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,819
What's your name?

89
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:49,491
T.J. Tom Junior, but T.J. is what they call me.

90
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,289
T.J. and Gia.

91
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,751
I like that. Come on.

92
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,838
- I'm leaving. - Hey, Gia, wait a minute. Where you going?

93
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:06,425
- I'm in charge, and I'm leaving. - Gia.

94
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:12,180
- Is that The Byrds? - They're so cool.

95
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,225
Wow. Rock my world.

96
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,186
Seventy- five cents?

97
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:23,817
It's pretty. Pretty. Very pretty.

98
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,485
Hello, ladies.

99
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,821
Can I have this? Come on.

100
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,323
- Hey. - Hey.

101
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,660
- Tattoo? - Tattoos.

102
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,620
- Tattoo you. - You getting a tattoo now?

103
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,122
No, tattoo you.

104
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:41,668
- I'm not getting a tattoo. - Come on. What? What?

105
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,712
Look at that hair. It's fabulous.

106
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,887
You want a tattoo now?

107
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,475
She'd be a Iot of fun.

108
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,857
So who are you looking at, him or me?

109
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,668
I can't talk about the sex.

110
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,838
I mean, how would I know?

111
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:54,843
If you ask me, she never really had sex with anybody.

112
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,431
But she did love to be photographed,

113
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,976
and people loved to take pictures of her and do little things for her.

114
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,853
She hated being photographed.

115
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:10,358
You had to run after her and tie her down.

116
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:15,655
Then you had to get past the clothes and the stuff in her hair.

117
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,700
But she was special.

118
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,609
Kathleen, Let's go.

119
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,445
Coming, coming.

120
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,951
All Right, Let's go.

121
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:20,595
And they showed her a beautiful house on the planet Mars.

122
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:25,058
And they said, "Come and live here forever."

123
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,310
And the young girl said,

124
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:31,272
"Mars is a planet where life's different.

125
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:35,735
"Safe, clean and pretty." Yes.

126
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,864
But... But how do you get there?

127
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:43,993
where do you find a taxi? which bus do you take?

128
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:47,831
Right? And how do you know you're there when you're there?

129
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:52,252
Philadelphia was not ready for this,

130
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,463
but New York was.

131
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,012
It was the Right moment,

132
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:07,976
and being of the moment is everything in fashion.

133
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:12,313
But of course, the more you were of the moment,

134
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:15,358
the faster you become of the past.

135
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,325
Okay, Let's get this over with.

136
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:27,746
Just go in there and try to be nice.

137
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,581
- Nice? - Yeah.

138
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:30,665
Nice.

139
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,543
Who knows? Maybe they'll like you.

140
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,589
- You are a very likable girl. - Fuck you.

141
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:41,676
Okay.

142
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,640
Hi.

143
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,729
I'm here to see Wilhelmina Cooper.

144
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:57,275
So's the rest of the world and the rest of the world's way ahead of you, honey.

145
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,902
Take a seat.

146
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,404
I have an appointment.

147
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,741
Hold, please.

148
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,368
Of course you do.

149
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:11,080
11 :00, Gia Marle Carangi.

150
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,707
"G" what?

151
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,336
Okay.

152
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:25,512
G- I- A.

153
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,642
There. Gia. Just fuck the rest of it. Call me Gia.

154
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,770
Do you think you can remember that, honey?

155
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:37,565
Yeah? cool. Now tell the bitch I'm here.

156
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:48,284
I've already seen the pictures, darling.Morris  sent them.

157
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,245
I wanted to see the real thing.

158
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,080
Well, this is it.

159
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,707
It certainly is.

160
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:58,419
You practically gave my receptionist a coronary.

161
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:04,217
Yeah, well, look. This was a free trlp to New York,

162
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:07,512
and if I knew you were looking for Marcla- fucking- Brady,

163
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:08,638
I would've stayed home.

164
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,808
How do you know what I'm looking for?

165
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:21,276
- Well, fuck, look at me. - I'm looking, I'm looking.

166
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:26,030
You know, dressing like a motorcycle tramp

167
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:29,117
is somewhat interesting for a 17-year-old girl.

168
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,620
Talking like one is not.

169
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:37,584
In fact, talking at all is not really requlred in this professlon

170
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,669
or even encouraged.

171
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:44,382
Anything you might have to say you say through the camera, the image,

172
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,468
and hopefully the product.

173
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:51,139
What comes out of your mouth is totally irrelevant.

174
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,974
Understood?

175
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:54,934
Yes, sir.

176
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:00,064
Now, this is a career,

177
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,150
this is a future,

178
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,652
this is a life

179
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,280
if you want it.

180
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,616
Does that mean you can get me a job?

181
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,159
No.

182
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,496
I get you the interviews,

183
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,916
you get the job.

184
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,340
And I belive you will.

185
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,552
Dear Diary, this is my life.

186
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:33,056
Go see Young & Rubicam, 9:45.

187
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,267
Go see people at Revlon, 11 :1 5.

188
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:40,730
Go see Jimmy Moore, Bob Stone, somebody "Malowinksl,"

189
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:44,817
and "Get lost, honey. You ain't what we're lookin' for."

190
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,738
- Next! - Thank you and fuck you. Bye- bye.

191
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:53,117
Yeah, I go see, I go see. Nobody sees me.

192
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:57,455
"Piece of meat, come here. Show me your bag."

193
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,624
And they stick their finger in you.

194
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,210
"I just wanna taste your temperature."

195
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:05,880
Go see, go see, go see, go see somebody else.

196
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,801
I ain't no good at this. I ain't no good at this at all.

197
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:14,430
But even if you are good at it, what exactly are you good at?

198
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:19,852
- You can't leave now. - I have to go.

199
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,563
What, what? To Philadelphia?

200
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,733
- For what? - I got stuff.

201
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,277
I have to go.

202
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:33,741
Well, somebody has to take care of me. I'm just a kid.

203
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:34,951
Bullshit.

204
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,671
What's in Philadelphia that's more important than me?

205
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,467
- Do not do that. - Do not do what?

206
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,597
Do not pretend you're gonna do something when you know you're not.

207
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,932
What am I not gonna do?

208
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:20,955
What else?

209
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:34,802
What?

210
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,859
- Do you know what I want? - What?

211
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,903
- Do you know what I want? - What?

212
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,162
What?

213
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,803
How do they fit?

214
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,692
This turn you on?

215
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:34,987
Yeah.

216
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,864
- Kind of. - All Right.

217
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,991
Come here.

218
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:52,213
- Have you ever had sex with a man? - Yeah.

219
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,298
Once.

220
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,300
And?

221
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:01,180
And I could've done that with a German shepherd.

222
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,483
Dear Book, this is another day in the life.

223
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,319
A life is like a book. A book is like a box.

224
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:19,073
A box has slx sides, inside and outside.

225
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,702
So how do you get to what's inside?

226
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:25,413
How do you get what's inside out?

227
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,665
Once upon a time, there was a very pretty girl

228
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:30,960
who lived in a beautiful box and everybody loved her.

229
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,804
- Yes, hello? - Hello?

230
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,347
- What? - Hello. Hi.

231
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,932
Who the hell is that?

232
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,476
- Will? - who is it?

233
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,770
- Christ's sake. - I couldn't sleep.

234
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,355
Gia.

235
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,108
- MiddIe of the night. - It's very late.

236
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,110
- l know. - God damn it.

237
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,029
Is that your husband?

238
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,782
- Yes. - ls he pissed?

239
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:03,618
Yes.

240
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:07,622
Is it true that he drinks? I mean, that's what everybody says.

241
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,458
- Gia. - And he gets violent?

242
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,794
What is it you want, Gia?

243
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,797
If he ever lays a hand on you, I'll fucking kllI him.

244
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,638
Why can't you sleep?

245
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,974
Do you want me to come over?

246
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,852
You're nervous about tomorrow.

247
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,153
Yeah, I am.

248
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:43,241
Well, everyone is nervous on their first shoot. You'll be fine.

249
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,578
Yeah, I just don't know what to do. You know?

250
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,039
Did you do your coIonic?

251
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,083
Yeah.

252
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,126
Good.

253
00:20:55,170 --> 00:21:01,342
Go to bed now. Take one half of the NembutaI. The yellow and black.

254
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,388
You'll be fine.

255
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:11,060
- Just be yourself. - Okay, yeah.

256
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,187
what is that?

257
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,857
Darling,

258
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:23,239
if I could answer that for you or for me,

259
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:29,745
well, life on this planet would be a very different proposltion.

260
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:45,469
So I tell her, "Look, I know CaIvin and I asked him about you,

261
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,263
"and he didn't even know who you were."

262
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:50,099
- She's such a Lying slag. Did she fllp? - Oh, man.

263
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,779
Excuse me, can I heIp you?

264
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:49,283
Yeah, yeah. Could I have some more coffee, please?

265
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,703
- Are you Gia? - That's me.

266
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,206
You're late. Go wash your face.

267
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:59,710
I already did. It's nice to meet you, too.

268
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,966
What the hell am I gonna do with you?

269
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,427
I got it.

270
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:14,308
I don't know. I'm just some dumb girl from PhllLy.

271
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,812
Oh, my God, she's a beast.

272
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,438
She scares me.

273
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:22,733
Why, Phllllpe, does she remind you of your mother?

274
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:27,029
No, she reminds me of my brother. He's in jall now, thank Jesus.

275
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:30,741
Okay.

276
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:42,878
What?

277
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,382
It's wonderful.

278
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,385
Let's see this face.

279
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:56,434
I'm checking to see if you need to be tweezed.

280
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,436
- I'm tweezed. - I'm Linda.

281
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,856
Nice to meet you.

282
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:04,567
Dreadful.

283
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,362
AbsoIuteLy horrendous.

284
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:11,782
More teeth.

285
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:16,620
Every photograph makes a promise, and the promise is never kept.

286
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,706
Look brain damaged.

287
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,541
That's what makes a photo great.

288
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,879
And if the promise is sex,

289
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:31,177
- then you really have something. - Good.

290
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,095
Wonderful.

291
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:35,973
Well,

292
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,017
that was all shit.

293
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,644
- Fuck you. - Now we can pay our rent.

294
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:43,189
Who wants to stay and make some art?

295
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,608
What's art?

296
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:49,236
Keep the fence, lose the clothes.

297
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,280
No, thanks, I'm gone.

298
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:54,074
I'm outta here. See you.

299
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:01,999
I'll stay if Linda stays.

300
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,453
- Linda, Liebling? - Yeah.

301
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,582
Go stand by the fence.

302
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,961
- You want me in the shot? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

303
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,797
And lose the clothes.

304
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:27,246
Sex... Sex was really easy. It was...

305
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:32,668
Sex was everywhere. It didn't really mean too much.

306
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:36,463
Love... Love was the hard thing to find.

307
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:44,805
Even if you were looking for it, which not too many people were.

308
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:53,564
Even if you found it, which not too many people did.

309
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:58,819
Even if it was Right there in front of you 

310
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:06,493
how could you see it with all the sex in the way?

311
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:02,424
Hey, where you going?

312
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,301
Gia.

313
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:07,221
What happened? What's the matter?

314
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:10,140
You don't have any clothes on.

315
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,727
Don't change the subject.

316
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:17,105
I have a boyfriend.

317
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,525
So?

318
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,444
So, I have to go.

319
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:26,365
"I have to go, I have to go." Everybody has to go.

320
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:29,409
Where the fuck does everybody go when they have to go, huh?

321
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:34,039
You... You and I had a...

322
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:36,375
I mean, it was... I had a...

323
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,086
I don't know.

324
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:44,591
I'm really very square.

325
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,052
So am I.

326
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,179
Yeah, I can see that.

327
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:53,517
Please, don't go.

328
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,231
Please, don't go. Please, I'll make you breakfast.

329
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,109
Come on.

330
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,575
- Going down? - No.

331
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,451
- Yes. - No!

332
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:14,246
No, no. What are you doing? No.

333
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:15,455
- I'm so sorry. - Linda!

334
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,874
I'm so sorry.

335
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:19,376
I'll call you.

336
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:25,966
Not.

337
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:29,303
It was like a puppy.

338
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:32,723
It was like, "Love me, Love me, Love me, Love me."

339
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,100
I did.

340
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,186
I did. I did Right away.

341
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,107
Extraordinary, as in phenomenal,

342
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:43,775
as in a gold mine.

343
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:49,656
Tough, vulnerable, old, young,

344
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,618
decadent, innocent,

345
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,703
male, female.

346
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:59,583
And you look like you don't give a shit.

347
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,965
I met somebody, someone I really like.

348
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:10,177
Good. Good for you.

349
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,847
Take a deep breath, darling.

350
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:19,061
You are in for the ride of your life.

351
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:36,995
Paolo.

352
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,542
Lower the fucking drawbrldge, Tony.

353
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,378
Give me some of those goddamn drink tickets.

354
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:48,548
Always a pIeasure to see you, too, Stephie, and this must be Gia.

355
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,801
How do you know my name?

356
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:53,220
I'm God, I know everything.

357
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,222
You see? Even God knows your name.

358
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:58,183
With a face like that, she doesn't need a name.

359
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:02,229
Actually, Tony, my face is a little higher.

360
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:07,401
Anytime, Gia, anytime.

361
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:09,903
Stop being stingy, Tony.

362
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,415
That's Ollvier Chandon, as in champagne.

363
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:25,210
Very rich. Did him in a car once.

364
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,672
I can't remember exactLy how fast we were going.

365
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:34,219
That's Stan Girardi. Used to do it with Cheryl, but he's doable.

366
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,931
Joe Jamison. Beautiful, but gay.

367
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,225
Not that that ever stopped me.

368
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,981
A little tongue up his ass,

369
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,774
and he's all yours.

370
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,659
You're full of shit, aren't you?

371
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:01,788
Look, sometimes even I don't belive it, but it's all true.

372
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,624
Okay, break it up.

373
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,919
- On your left. - Who was that?

374
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,463
I have no idea.

375
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:37,908
I do be the prettiest, prettiest girl. I do be that.

376
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:54,966
No, she's new, brand new. You have to see her. You'll like her.

377
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:08,063
- She's on the cover. - Gia, yeah.

378
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,941
No last name. Just Gia.

379
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:43,056
Boring.

380
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,517
Played out.

381
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:47,519
Fat.

382
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,148
Boring.

383
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,276
Too dumb.

384
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,154
For winter, we need meat.

385
00:35:57,446 --> 00:36:02,868
We need someone with bloodin her veins. Not just suntan oll and mineraI water.

386
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:08,248
Oh, God, I am so sick of her face.

387
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:18,758
- Who's this? - This is one of Wilhelmina's new girls, Gia.

388
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,436
This is meat.

389
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,939
This is sirloin. It's lusty.

390
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:38,278
Winter is carnivorous. rich browns, reds, big animal prints.

391
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,614
This is it. Yes!

392
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,083
Hey.

393
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,505
I just bought it. What do you think?

394
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,841
- Wow. - "Wow"?

395
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,679
Wanna go for a ride?

396
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:08,850
- I don't know. - Yeah, you do. Come on.

397
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:16,316
Yes!

398
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,571
- Where we going? - Philadelphia.

399
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:22,656
What?

400
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:28,495
- Hold on ! - I am !

401
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:32,666
Yeah?

402
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,670
Hi, Kathleen.

403
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:40,340
Gia. Oh, my God.

404
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:46,513
Oh, my God ! Come on in.

405
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:50,308
- Come on. - This is my girlfriend, Linda.

406
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:55,397
Linda? Yeah, hi. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

407
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,107
So, tell me about New York.

408
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:59,943
Oh, God, it was like seeing an old girlfriend.

409
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:03,613
Yeah, she told me all the gosslp about all the models.

410
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:07,701
You know, who had bad skin and who had bad hair.

411
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:13,665
The things that they did, she told me about, the places that they went. Oh, my God.

412
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,794
Oh, my God !

413
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:20,880
You're on the cover of Vogue! I can't belive it.

414
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:26,094
Oh, my God, isn't that beautiful?

415
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,054
Oh, honey.

416
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:32,309
So what else is going on, huh? Do you have a boyfriend?

417
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:36,062
No. Linda has a boyfriend.

418
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,314
- Yeah? - Yeah.

419
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,065
Well, that's nice.

420
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:44,654
- I have a girlfriend. - Yeah, that's nice, too,

421
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,240
though it's not the same thing, is it?

422
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:51,244
And we never talked about the past. That was over.

423
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:55,165
The past was the past. She never discussed it with me once.

424
00:38:56,083 --> 00:39:00,086
It was like it never happened, all those years in between.

425
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,006
It was like it never happened.

426
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:07,093
I kept everything you've sent me.

427
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:11,473
I keep everything you ever touched ever since you were a baby.

428
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:14,893
What do I have? Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

429
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,519
My journaI.

430
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:25,695
"Once upon a time..."

431
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,699
"Once upon a time, there was a girl with golden hair

432
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:32,869
"who went to llve in a beautiful house."

433
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:36,331
Always the same story, yeah?

434
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:40,460
Always different, always the same.

435
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,837
Always the same.

436
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:49,761
Can I see?

437
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:52,764
Yeah.

438
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:02,732
Sometimes I think she was a different person to everybody.

439
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,694
Sometimes I knew who she was.

440
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,697
Sometimes I didn't.

441
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:14,160
Anybody who trles to tell you exactLy who she was,

442
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,704
they didn't know her at all.

443
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:23,002
We did everything together. Yeah, in those days.

444
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:25,338
Yeah, everything.

445
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:31,678
All right.

446
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,102
This is...

447
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:43,314
What can I say? It's you.

448
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:45,692
I found it on short notice.

449
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,071
That's what it looks like.

450
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:54,576
So, I was standing in the middle of the living room,

451
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,369
and the bathroom door opens.

452
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:59,122


453
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:01,708
- Yeah? - Who's that?

454
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:03,042
Who?

455
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:11,593
I started making trlps to New York regularLy after that.

456
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,762
She wanted me there. She wanted me there all the time.

457
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,515
I couldn't, you know, because l had a husband, l had a home.

458
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:21,686
No, not red. Yellow. Yellow roses.

459
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,396
But l would go...

460
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,273
- To Linda. - ...and l would stay for maybe a week.

461
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:27,317
Sometimes l would stay two.

462
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:30,195
Love on ya, Gia.

463
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:36,201
You're sending fIowers to a girl?

464
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:40,663
- Here, lady. - Hi. Got it. Thanks.

465
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,175
Christ, another one?

466
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:56,513
- Who died? - None of your business.

467
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:03,019
Are you fucking a florist behind my back?

468
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:07,273
Yeah. Gold FTD guy with the winged shoes.

469
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,199
Hi.

470
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,288
I've been calling you for weeks.

471
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:23,540
Hi, Gia.

472
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:31,506
- This is my boyfriend, Billy. - Hi. I'm wrecked.

473
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:38,680
- Do you wanna come in? - I don't think that's a very good idea.

474
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:40,139
Why not?

475
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:44,143
You are really beautiful.

476
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:46,813
You're a model, aren't you?

477
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:49,023
Why? Do I look stupid?

478
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:54,529
- I have to work tomorrow. - Come on, it's early.

479
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:58,533
Maybe... Maybe we could party.

480
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:10,670
You are the most beautiful woman that I have ever seen.

481
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,171
Come with me.

482
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:13,798
I can't.

483
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:27,687
Fine, see you around.

484
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,113
What the fuck was that?

485
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:41,034
Behold the florist.

486
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:26,829
No, no, no!

487
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:28,998
I cannot stay!

488
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:33,419
Look, I'll come back, but I have to go home now, Gia.

489
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,713
- But I'll come back. - No, no, no.

490
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:42,637
If you need me, you just call me.

491
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:45,348
I need you. I need you now.

492
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,725
- You have to be here now! - Gia. Gia. Gia.

493
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:52,438
When I need you, I need you now! I need you, Mom !

494
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:57,485
Listen to me. You are a big girl, all Right?

495
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:02,907
- Please! Please! - You are a big girl, act like a big girl.

496
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:06,494
You've got to, and you are.

497
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:10,164
So be my big girl.

498
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:14,752
Now listen to me.

499
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,797
Listen to me. Listen to me.

500
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:22,510
I have to go home.

501
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,137
I have to.

502
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,389
Fine. Fine!

503
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:30,268
- Fine. Get out! - No, Gia. All Right, now, wait.

504
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,561
- Wait! - Get the fuck out!

505
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:33,730
No, not like this, Gia.

506
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:36,441
Yeah, like this! Get out! There. Get the fuck out!

507
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,609
- Gia, for God's sake. - Get out!

508
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:41,279
- Not like this, not like this. - Yeah, like this. Get the fuck out!

509
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:43,573
- Look. - There, get out! Get out!

510
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:46,909
- All Right. Fine, fine, fine. Fine. - Go, go!

511
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,828
- All Right, fine. - Get out!

512
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:50,913
Fine, Gia.

513
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,459
That's it.

514
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:56,919
That...

515
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:26,699
She's booked for 16 shoots this week, but I'll see what we can do.

516
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,284
And you are erupting forms...

517
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:29,660
Tell Scavullo he can have her...

518
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:32,622
...out of the center of all this tired, old beauty.

519
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:34,540
Shaming them.

520
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:38,085
Excuse me? "Tired, old beauty"?

521
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:43,049
You can have Renee. I know you want Gia, but you can't have Gia. Nothing until June.

522
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:46,677
This little wop is not standing in front of me. You got that?

523
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:48,805
I'm off to the side, or I walk.

524
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:51,349
Yeah, me, too.

525
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:53,476
Does this dress make my ass look fat?

526
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,353
Your ass is fat, honey.

527
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:58,439
And I'm not standing next to her fat ass.

528
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:07,073
I know.

529
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:11,118
Life is so disappointing.

530
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,329
Here you are.

531
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:15,248
You have arrived.

532
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:20,336
You are here. This is your moment.

533
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:24,090
What do you have?

534
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:26,342
You have pain.

535
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:32,473
When you have everything,

536
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,684
what do you have?

537
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:37,562
You have nothing.

538
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:42,942
When everything is Right, everything is wrong.

539
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,487
It's disappointing. It's confusing.

540
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:51,075
This is life. What can you do?

541
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:56,706
People keep going away from me. That hurts.

542
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:01,294
Work.

543
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,921
Work. You have a gift.

544
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:05,464
Use it.

545
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,551
Life... Life will be there later.

546
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:13,598
When you've worked, and you've llved,

547
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:17,310
and you know who you are, life is easy.

548
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:20,396
Work.

549
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,566
It's the only answer I know.

550
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,403
I should've been a rock star.

551
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:31,157
But I can't sing.

552
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:36,871
Work now.

553
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:38,915
You can llve later.

554
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:45,254
You'd say anything to get that shot. Yeah?

555
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,632
- Yes. - Yes.

556
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:50,009
In this case, I'm saying the truth.

557
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:54,764
Sweetheart.

558
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:58,476
Now here's the picture. You girls all hate Gia

559
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,103
because she is so much prettier than the rest of you.

560
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:06,359
And you're all so Boring. She is so exclting.

561
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:11,113
If you don't like it, please, vanish from my world.

562
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:13,366
No, I'm sorry, she's not avallable.

563
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:15,159
l know, darling. You can't get...

564
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:17,662
And she went to live in a beautiful house

565
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:21,290
and all the people loved her, and she was very, very happy.

566
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:25,044
No, she's on her way to Rome then. She's shooting Versace in MIlan

567
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:27,672
and Yves Saint Laurent in Paris.

568
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:30,549
Perry has her for the only runway show she's doing.

569
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:33,177
But the people in the village were very poor,

570
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:36,555
and every night, they crept into the house where the girl slept

571
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:41,060
and they cut off a piece of her golden hair and they sold it for money.

572
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:44,480
"She'll never even notice," they said.

573
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:48,150
And so, all the gold was gone from her head.

574
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,152
It's a real cinderella story.

575
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:59,578
- Tell him to hurry. Where's my tickets? - You are wired.

576
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:03,582
Here. Try some of this.

577
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,878
What? What is it?

578
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:11,215
The answer to all your prayers.

579
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:56,260
The only thing you have to remember is that it's not about you.

580
00:50:56,470 --> 00:51:00,389
lt's not about you. lt's not you that they're looking at.

581
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:02,516
It's not about you.

582
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:06,520
I'm on top of that. I understand that.

583
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:09,815
Honey, that's good. I'm so glad about that.

584
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:14,987
Because if you let it be about you, then you're screwed, you know.

585
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:18,824
So, you have to stay separate from what's happening

586
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,910
and you have to be somewhere else.

587
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:24,914
But I don't know where that somewhere else is, you know?

588
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:26,457
Or how to do that.

589
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:30,461
Honey, you can do whatever you want now.

590
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:33,839
Yeah? What is it I want?

591
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:36,300
What do I want?

592
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:54,860
I will be king, and you will be queen.

593
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:11,001
I don't think a woman is really a woman unless she's a bIonde, you know.

594
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:18,217
Response is so enormous. I've never seen anything like it.

595
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:20,761
And so fast, huh?

596
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:24,140
About a million people want to shoot you this month.

597
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:28,060
We're going to name a whole phone line after you. Gia.

598
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,564
I could Iearn photography.

599
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:33,858
That could be something to want. I could...

600
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:36,235
I could photograph chlldren.

601
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:39,780
I could have my own chlldren.

602
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:42,658
I would give them yellow roses.

603
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:48,205
And if they got too Ioud, I would just put them someplace quiet.

604
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:51,083
I'd put them in the oven.

605
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:54,920
And I would kiss them every day

606
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:59,925
and tell them, "You don't have to be anybody,"

607
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:05,431
because I would know that being somebody doesn't make you anybody anyway.

608
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:11,103
You will always be somebody to me.

609
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:13,772
You will always be somebody to me.

610
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:17,401
And on the financlal front, with the sudden illness of wilhelmina Cooper,

611
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:19,445
who's still hospitalized in Manhattan,

612
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:38,297
She's doing all Right. You know, they're running some more tests.

613
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:40,216
Maybe in a day or two, then we'll know something.

614
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,386
Come on, you gotta heIp me here. I'm under a Iot of pressure.

615
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:46,263
I can't give you any answers.

616
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:47,932
Gia,

617
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:51,644
I've been thinking a Iot about you lateLy.

618
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:54,480
It's terrible, terrible, isn't it?

619
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:58,776
Mike MansfieId, starting up the new Largo Agency.

620
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,695
What do you think you're gonna do now?

621
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:03,447
What do you mean?

622
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:06,325
Well, you're a special girl

623
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:09,328
with special problems.

624
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:12,248
I think you need special attention.

625
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:14,917
You could go to Ford

626
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,753
and there's always that asshoIe over at Ellte.

627
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:22,883
But I think you should put some serious thought into coming with me.

628
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:25,344
Why? Why would I leave Wili?

629
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:30,891
You have to start thinking about yourself. You have to be tough.

630
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:33,894
This is a business, and in this business

631
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:37,523
you can't be represented by a dead woman.

632
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,527
Excuse me.

633
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:44,238
Why don't you give me a call?

634
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:49,535
Yes, darling, I know it's so inconvenient.

635
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:50,828
Get me a copy of the call sheet,

636
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:52,997
and tell Freddie I wanted to speak to him 10 minutes ago.

637
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:55,499
- Done. I'll take care of it. - Gia, darling, kiss me.

638
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:58,585
Yes I have to go too.

639
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:03,966
- Have a wonderful trip. - Tell Christian to behave himself.

640
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:05,509
clao darling.

641
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:11,015
- I'm exhausted. - Me, too.

642
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:15,936
Come here, come here, come here.

643
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:19,815
I thought you were sick.

644
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:23,861
I am sick, darling, sick and tired,

645
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:26,822
but it's not serious.

646
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:31,994
- I'm tired, too. - You?

647
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:33,579
Yeah. Yeah.

648
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:38,751
I think I wanna stop for a whlle. You know, I need some time to think.

649
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:43,881
Yes, but not now, darling.

650
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:48,385
PIenty of time to rest when you're in the ground.

651
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:50,804
You have...

652
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:53,766
the whole world...

653
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:57,102
at your fingertips.

654
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:03,275
You have to be strong. Seize the moment.

655
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,945
Because if you don't,

656
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:10,699
there's always another girl waiting Right behind you

657
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,743
breathing over your shoulder.

658
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:19,833
Come on.

659
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:24,630
I know. I know it's hard.

660
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:26,799
We can do it.

661
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:31,804
You and I together.

662
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:45,275
She really looked dead, didn't she?

663
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,487
The great thing about the afterlife is nobody cares how you look.

664
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:50,114
I can hardly wait.

665
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:54,326
Too rich and too thin.

666
00:56:55,495 --> 00:57:00,958
- I had no idea she was that sick. - You can never really tell with Germans.

667
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:30,320
God !

668
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:25,000
Great. That's beautiful. Okay, really nice. cool.

669
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:28,170
Right. Can you roll your eyes back a little so we can see the white under them?

670
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:31,381
- We're going for the seppuku look. - What is that?

671
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:34,551
Japanese. Sorry, it means that you're half dead.

672
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,346
- I'm there. - I know, it's great.

673
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:41,517
You, you are doing so, so good.

674
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:44,269
Really, you look super.

675
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:48,482
Oh, my God. Did you almost just throw up?

676
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:50,651
Look, I'm really sick.

677
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:52,486
Can you go make a run downtown for me, please?

678
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:54,696
You're not gonna throw up on this dress, are you?

679
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:58,909
Just... I'm sick. Go downtown. All Right?

680
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:02,037
There's a taco place, and you ask for Satellite or rich Boy.

681
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:03,956
Okay? Yeah?

682
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:06,708
- Chasing the dragon, are you? - Yeah, I'm sorry.

683
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:11,213
No, it works, it works. A little death around the eyes.

684
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:16,009
Okay, great. Fabulous. Great. Good.

685
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:18,512
That's really great. That's great.

686
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:27,396
Fantastic. Right by the bike. Good. Bad girl, bad girl.

687
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:28,939
Good.

688
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:32,943
Yeah, that's it. Great.

689
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:36,655
Good. Fantastic.

690
00:59:37,031 --> 00:59:40,909
- She's out of her fucking mind ! - Could Cheryl Tiegs do this?

691
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:42,744
I don't think so.

692
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:45,956
Go.

693
00:59:55,842 --> 01:00:00,387
Hey, wait! Hey, where you going? Hey!

694
01:01:24,138 --> 01:01:27,265
- Hey, where's Satellite? Is he here? - Yeah.

695
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:33,105
Come here.

696
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:35,941
Fuck.

697
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:09,891
Hey, you bitch.

698
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:45,635
Where's Satellite?

699
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:49,431
Where is Satellite?

700
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:58,356
I am sick, fucking junkies. I'm sick! Where is he?

701
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:00,650
He's making a dellvery.

702
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:07,866
- Is anybody holding anything? Please! - I'll give you my shot.

703
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:13,580
I don't shoot. Do you have anything else, dry?

704
01:03:13,664 --> 01:03:17,083
No, man. All I got is in here.

705
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:20,879
I can't.

706
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:26,968
- Okay, if you don't want it... - Wait.

707
01:03:31,265 --> 01:03:33,892
I want it. You do me. Will you do it?

708
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:36,603
Yeah.

709
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:40,982
Yeah, I'll do you.

710
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:59,417
Is this gonna hurt?

711
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:03,088
No pain.

712
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:07,259
Thank you.

713
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:12,138
Don't be scared, baby.

714
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:15,058
I'll take you home.

715
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:19,229
Oh, God.

716
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:02,230
Oh, my God.

717
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:06,985
I was thinking about you.

718
01:05:15,953 --> 01:05:17,329
Are you okay?

719
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,628
Is your boyfriend here?

720
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:28,340
I don't have a boyfriend anymore.

721
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:41,061
I'm all dirty.

722
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:16,513
I was afraid of the drugs.

723
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:19,015
The way people used them.

724
01:06:19,558 --> 01:06:22,227
I told her that. I mean, she knew that.

725
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:25,230
I was afraid of a Iot of things.

726
01:06:26,023 --> 01:06:28,942
But she promised,

727
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:31,361
and l believed her.

728
01:06:31,445 --> 01:06:35,615
And l believed we could make things work.

729
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:39,452
l believed because we both wanted it so much that we could.

730
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:41,162
we could...

731
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:48,378
And we did. we did. we did make it work.

732
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:42,474
You're coming home?

733
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:45,477
You're coming home? Just out of the bIue you're coming home?

734
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:47,520
Just like that you call me?

735
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:52,192
You are a piece of work, you are.

736
01:07:52,276 --> 01:07:54,360
Philadelphia?

737
01:07:54,445 --> 01:07:57,155
The bitch is in Philadelphia?

738
01:07:57,490 --> 01:08:00,617
I'm kllling myself trying to keep this agency allve,

739
01:08:01,285 --> 01:08:02,994
which is not easy,

740
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:07,040
since my wife with her dying breath screwed me out of 50% of the company.

741
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:09,417
Fucking women.

742
01:08:10,544 --> 01:08:12,420
And now you tell me this little

743
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:15,548
whateverjust disappears.

744
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:19,511
I hope she fucking dies in Philadelphia.

745
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:24,724
It's a 21-day program.

746
01:08:24,809 --> 01:08:29,062
It's your responslbllity to come in every day and take the methadone.

747
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:34,859
All Right. Drink the water.

748
01:08:35,694 --> 01:08:37,070
That's all Right.

749
01:08:37,696 --> 01:08:39,364
I need you to drink the water.

750
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:47,705
And slgn next to the line.

751
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:00,635
Okay.

752
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:05,181
Dwayne King.

753
01:09:06,225 --> 01:09:09,435
There you are, Mr. Doodiekins. Fresh from the oven.

754
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,312
Thank you, Mrs. Doodiekins.

755
01:09:22,074 --> 01:09:25,618
I could do this, you know that? I could be a fucking housewife.

756
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,787
I'd be very happy.

757
01:09:39,049 --> 01:09:40,758
So, I cooked.

758
01:09:43,804 --> 01:09:45,138
Ketchup.

759
01:09:46,974 --> 01:09:48,099
Dinner's ready.

760
01:09:51,812 --> 01:09:53,438
Dinner is served.

761
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:07,452
It's very depressing, this apartment.

762
01:10:07,953 --> 01:10:10,371
All Right, all Right. "Shut up, Mom."

763
01:10:10,956 --> 01:10:14,959
So, is Linda coming back tonight or is she staying in New York?

764
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:17,629
I don't know. If she works late, she's gonna stay.

765
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:23,801
I hate what this methadone is doing to your shoulders.

766
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:27,472
They used to stand up so straight, so beautiful.

767
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:28,890
Come on.

768
01:10:35,272 --> 01:10:38,399
And you have to watch your weight, too.

769
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:41,027
You want to look good for when you go back to work.

770
01:10:42,988 --> 01:10:44,906
- I'm not going back to work. - Okay.

771
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:46,074
- I can't. - All Right.

772
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:48,159
Do you understand that?

773
01:10:50,162 --> 01:10:52,789
That's how you feel now.

774
01:10:52,873 --> 01:10:55,333
But just wait. You'll see.

775
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:07,178
Hi, this is Linda. I'm not here. Leave a message.

776
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:12,684
Hi, Doo- doo. lt's me. I've been calling all night. where are you?

777
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:16,020
- Linda? - Hello?

778
01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:21,192
- Who's this? - This is Billy. Who's this?

779
01:11:23,904 --> 01:11:24,904
Gia?

780
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:27,532
Gia.

781
01:11:31,912 --> 01:11:35,415
Damn it! God damn it, Gia!

782
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:41,587
Oh, my God, she broke into my house. She stole some money.

783
01:11:42,506 --> 01:11:44,132
She stole jewelry.

784
01:11:44,216 --> 01:11:48,511
She bought the drugs and then she took off in the car like a crazy person.

785
01:11:48,595 --> 01:11:51,097
It was unbelievable.

786
01:11:51,181 --> 01:11:53,141
She took my wedding ring!

787
01:11:53,225 --> 01:11:54,767
Stop the vehicle and pull over.

788
01:11:54,852 --> 01:11:56,227
And the lies.

789
01:11:57,062 --> 01:12:01,149
You know that old joke, how can you tell when a junkie is lying?

790
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:02,942
Her llps are moving.

791
01:12:04,028 --> 01:12:05,528
It's not funny.

792
01:12:17,249 --> 01:12:18,708
Step out of the car.

793
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:23,838
- Why are you chasing me? Are you crazy? - Lady.

794
01:12:23,922 --> 01:12:25,923
I'm trying to get to New York, and you're fucking chasing me?

795
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:29,761
- All Right, ma'am. CaIm down. - What is wrong with you, huh? God !

796
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:31,054
- Ma'am? - What?

797
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:35,725
What the... Just back off, okay? God !

798
01:12:35,809 --> 01:12:37,143
- Ma'am? - I have to go.

799
01:12:37,227 --> 01:12:38,269
Hey.

800
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:42,357
Ma'am? Hey!

801
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:45,443
Get fucking arrested for nothing, that's why.

802
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:48,237
These are serious charges. Reckless driving.

803
01:12:48,322 --> 01:12:51,532
- This is reslsting arrest. - God damn it! It's not my fault!

804
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:53,326
It was not my fault either!

805
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:55,370
He was there getting some stuff out of my apartment!

806
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:58,164
I wasn't even there! I was on my way back here!

807
01:13:00,125 --> 01:13:02,752
Thank God, because otherwise, you'd still be in jall.

808
01:13:02,836 --> 01:13:04,420
I have to go back to work.

809
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:06,464
I know what you're gonna say, but I need the money.

810
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:10,385
Stop it! Stop it.

811
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:13,429
I need the money so I can be with you, because I cannot llve like this.

812
01:13:13,514 --> 01:13:16,599
I cannot llve like this, okay? I can't llve like this.

813
01:13:18,102 --> 01:13:19,894
And I can't llve without you.

814
01:13:21,313 --> 01:13:23,064
You want to come to Largo now?

815
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:27,902
Is that because everyone else is afraid of slgning you?

816
01:13:27,986 --> 01:13:29,904
No, I haven't asked anyone else.

817
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:31,864
Then why me?

818
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:34,951
Because you're a greedy fuck

819
01:13:35,035 --> 01:13:37,537
and you'll get me more money than anyone else.

820
01:13:38,288 --> 01:13:42,333
That's the truth.

821
01:13:44,461 --> 01:13:47,505
So, Let me be truthful with you.

822
01:13:50,342 --> 01:13:55,012
Everyone's aware of the drug problem. You weren't very discreet.

823
01:13:55,931 --> 01:13:57,390
Well, I'm clean now,

824
01:13:58,267 --> 01:13:59,725
and I want to work.

825
01:14:07,192 --> 01:14:08,359
Let me see your arms.

826
01:14:11,655 --> 01:14:14,449
It's not my arms you want. It's my face,

827
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:16,451
and my tits.

828
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:18,077
And they're fine.

829
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:26,002
We're doing a teIevislon piece on models.

830
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:27,712
I want you to be in it.

831
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:32,717
I want you to look more beautiful

832
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:34,594
than you have ever looked.

833
01:14:35,512 --> 01:14:38,306
And I want you to tell the world

834
01:14:39,266 --> 01:14:43,936
that you once had a drug problem and now you don't.

835
01:14:44,021 --> 01:14:46,731
Now you're a good little girl.

836
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:51,944
If you do that,

837
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:54,572
we have a deaI.

838
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:08,336
Okay.

839
01:15:09,129 --> 01:15:10,213
Good.

840
01:15:15,427 --> 01:15:17,678
- I can't do this. - Yes, you can.

841
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:19,680
I'm a model. I don't talk.

842
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:22,767
I'm not supposed to talk. I'm supposed to just look beautiful.

843
01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:25,228
You are beautiful.

844
01:15:26,647 --> 01:15:28,564
You make me beautiful.

845
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:30,441
Hello.

846
01:15:30,734 --> 01:15:32,527
Okay. We're all set.

847
01:15:32,611 --> 01:15:35,363
I'm gonna tape you getting made up. Kind of a before- and- after thing.

848
01:15:35,447 --> 01:15:37,323
- Great. - We've aIso got some interviews

849
01:15:37,407 --> 01:15:40,159
set up with your friends, your family, your mother.

850
01:15:40,244 --> 01:15:41,994
You're gonna put my mother on tape?

851
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:45,623
- Yes, most definitely. - well, that should be interesting.

852
01:15:48,168 --> 01:15:50,461
- You ready? - Yeah.

853
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:52,213
Good.

854
01:15:53,465 --> 01:15:56,259
- I just have to go to the bathroom. - Sure.

855
01:15:57,719 --> 01:15:58,970
Why don't you guys come over here?

856
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:01,639
This is what I want. I want the questions to be short and qulck.

857
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:50,813
And how did things first start for you in modeling?

858
01:16:52,357 --> 01:16:56,360
I started working with very good people.

859
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:59,780
A Iot of them. Very fast, you know?

860
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:04,243
I didn't bulld into being a model.

861
01:17:04,328 --> 01:17:06,704
I just sort of became one.

862
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:09,206
How has that affected you?

863
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:15,379
When you're young, you don't always know.

864
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:19,508
It's hard to make out the difference

865
01:17:19,593 --> 01:17:23,220
between what's real and what is not real.

866
01:17:25,223 --> 01:17:30,394
At one point, you kind of got into the drug scene, didn't you?

867
01:17:34,524 --> 01:17:38,277
Yes, yes, you could say that I did.

868
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:40,905
But you're free of it now, aren't you?

869
01:17:41,031 --> 01:17:44,200
Yes. DefiniteLy, I'm free of it.

870
01:17:45,243 --> 01:17:48,829
I wouldn't be here Right now talking to all of you if I wasn't.

871
01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:50,665
Are you happy with your success?

872
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:56,671
Are you happy with your success?

873
01:17:56,755 --> 01:17:58,047
I...

874
01:17:59,591 --> 01:18:02,426
Yes. Yeah.

875
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:05,054
- l am. - You hesltated.

876
01:18:07,599 --> 01:18:11,852
I just wanted to think about it. But, no, I'm definiteLy happy with it.

877
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:14,355
Good. Thank you.

878
01:18:14,439 --> 01:18:16,023
Yeah, thank you.

879
01:18:38,338 --> 01:18:41,298
Fuck! What the fuck?

880
01:18:42,467 --> 01:18:45,469
I, like, kick Spider- Man's ass!

881
01:18:51,309 --> 01:18:55,229
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

882
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:02,820
I just wanted to make you smlie.

883
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:11,245
Okay.

884
01:19:11,621 --> 01:19:14,206
Okay, I'm going. Last chance.

885
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:19,420
I'm leaving, through the front door.

886
01:19:19,504 --> 01:19:20,963
I can't do this.

887
01:19:21,506 --> 01:19:23,507
Don't say that. Just say you'll see me tomorrow.

888
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:26,510
- No, you won't. You won't see me tomorrow. - Don't say that!

889
01:19:26,636 --> 01:19:27,845
Don't say that.

890
01:19:28,722 --> 01:19:31,724
We had a deaI. We made a bargain.

891
01:19:36,229 --> 01:19:37,563
I Love you.

892
01:19:39,816 --> 01:19:41,192
No, you don't.

893
01:19:43,195 --> 01:19:46,864
All Right, I don't. I don't. I don't.

894
01:19:49,242 --> 01:19:52,661
What are you, huh? You some kind of fucking pollceman?

895
01:19:52,746 --> 01:19:55,498
You going to judge me? I did one fucking line.

896
01:19:55,582 --> 01:19:56,999
One line.

897
01:19:57,709 --> 01:20:00,044
What is the big deaI?

898
01:20:00,128 --> 01:20:03,214
What about yesterday? What about the day before?

899
01:20:07,427 --> 01:20:08,719
Nothing.

900
01:20:09,137 --> 01:20:11,138
I did nothing. I promise.

901
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:13,224
Please, don't leave me.

902
01:20:13,308 --> 01:20:15,267
I don't belive you.

903
01:20:19,272 --> 01:20:21,899
You don't belive me because you don't want to belive me, do you?

904
01:20:21,983 --> 01:20:25,236
Because you don't care! Because you just wanted to say,

905
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:28,364
"I'm fucking a model !" Huh? "I'm fucking a model !"

906
01:20:28,448 --> 01:20:29,949
You don't care about me at all, do you?

907
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:33,869
Do you? Tell me you don't care! Say, "I don't care! I don't care!"

908
01:20:54,057 --> 01:20:56,767
Please. I'm sorry.

909
01:20:58,478 --> 01:21:01,564
I need you so much. Don't make me do this.

910
01:21:04,484 --> 01:21:06,110
I don't make you do anything.

911
01:21:06,653 --> 01:21:08,112
I wish I could.

912
01:21:09,781 --> 01:21:14,034
You could. You could. You could.

913
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,121
You could take care of me.

914
01:21:25,839 --> 01:21:28,632
- Do you have $30? - No.

915
01:21:32,512 --> 01:21:34,638
I don't have any money.

916
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:36,724
I don't know why. I never have it.

917
01:21:36,808 --> 01:21:38,767
I never have any money.

918
01:21:44,482 --> 01:21:45,858
In my sock.

919
01:22:02,292 --> 01:22:04,877
- This is what makes you do everything. - No, it doesn't.

920
01:22:04,961 --> 01:22:08,172
Yeah. It's not me. It's not you. It's this.

921
01:22:08,548 --> 01:22:10,215
This shit holds you.

922
01:22:12,302 --> 01:22:15,262
- You choose. - Come on.

923
01:22:15,347 --> 01:22:25,105
Yeah, this or me.

924
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:33,572
Your finger.

925
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:37,660
Your knees.

926
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:43,415
Your skin.

927
01:22:44,542 --> 01:22:45,709
Your toes.

928
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:58,263
I Love you.

929
01:24:24,392 --> 01:24:25,392
Gia!

930
01:24:48,708 --> 01:24:49,958
Change.

931
01:25:16,611 --> 01:25:18,362
She is over.

932
01:25:20,073 --> 01:25:21,782
It's just a question of time now.

933
01:25:29,541 --> 01:25:31,166
Hey, come on.

934
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:37,589
- Hi. - Yes, you are.

935
01:25:37,674 --> 01:25:39,258
You dropped this, honey.

936
01:25:40,677 --> 01:25:43,220
You want to come on and finish this fiasco?

937
01:25:43,346 --> 01:25:44,346
No.

938
01:25:53,731 --> 01:25:55,440
You look so pretty.

939
01:25:57,318 --> 01:25:58,318
Yeah.

940
01:26:01,573 --> 01:26:02,739
Thanks.

941
01:26:05,034 --> 01:26:06,326
I love you.

942
01:26:08,746 --> 01:26:11,081
I know. You love everybody.

943
01:26:18,423 --> 01:26:20,841
Gia, listen to me. l am trying to get you work.

944
01:26:20,925 --> 01:26:22,843
But it's all spring stuff now.

945
01:26:23,386 --> 01:26:26,847
Everybody wants the bIondes with the suntans and the sundresses.

946
01:26:26,931 --> 01:26:29,975
I'm sorry. No, your look is not spring.

947
01:26:30,059 --> 01:26:32,311
Your look is more like nuclear fucking winter, and nobody wants it.

948
01:26:32,395 --> 01:26:33,770
Hang up the phone.

949
01:26:34,564 --> 01:26:35,939
I am so tense.

950
01:26:36,566 --> 01:26:39,401
Ron, can you use some of those fucking muscles?

951
01:26:40,945 --> 01:26:42,613
I'm so tense.

952
01:26:43,615 --> 01:26:48,118
"When she kisses me, I feel all four winds bIow at my face.

953
01:26:48,745 --> 01:26:53,207
"But what do you do with a woman who has no love for you?

954
01:27:00,506 --> 01:27:02,758
"She is my lost captive

955
01:27:03,468 --> 01:27:06,803
"and no longer lies along my legs."

956
01:27:11,017 --> 01:27:12,476
l wrote that for you.

957
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:59,564
- Why did they send her out? - Because I asked for her.

958
01:27:59,649 --> 01:28:01,358
- All Right? - All Right.

959
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:13,704
We use them up,

960
01:28:15,039 --> 01:28:16,540
throw them away.

961
01:28:19,377 --> 01:28:23,046
No.

962
01:28:25,466 --> 01:28:29,011
- Where's my knife? - I haven't seen it.

963
01:28:29,762 --> 01:28:31,763
Who took my fucking knife?

964
01:28:33,474 --> 01:28:36,101
Who do I look like, a fucking terrorist? Is this funny?

965
01:28:36,185 --> 01:28:38,478
- What the fuck is wrong with you people? - Gia.

966
01:28:38,563 --> 01:28:40,564
Get the fuck away from me!

967
01:28:40,898 --> 01:28:43,900
Get away! Where's my knife?

968
01:28:46,404 --> 01:28:49,364
Here it is. Here it is.

969
01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:55,162
You know, you can't do that.

970
01:28:55,246 --> 01:28:57,414
You can't take somebody's knife when they need it!

971
01:28:57,498 --> 01:28:59,916
It's all Right. It's fine.

972
01:29:01,419 --> 01:29:04,379
- Look at the tracks on her arms. - Okay, now.

973
01:29:04,464 --> 01:29:06,006
And that awful thing on her hand.

974
01:29:06,758 --> 01:29:08,925
- It looks like a voIcano. - All Right.

975
01:29:12,138 --> 01:29:14,139
Try... Try folding your arms.

976
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:20,604
Put them in back of you.

977
01:29:21,731 --> 01:29:23,690
Well, you've almost got it.

978
01:29:23,775 --> 01:29:25,609
Now, try sltting on your hands.

979
01:29:28,529 --> 01:29:30,197
Yes, yes.

980
01:29:32,116 --> 01:29:33,784
You look wonderful.

981
01:29:35,703 --> 01:29:37,329
Beautiful.

982
01:29:50,927 --> 01:29:53,720
- Francesco? - Yes, sweetheart?

983
01:29:54,972 --> 01:29:56,223
Thank you.

984
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:03,855
Gia, this is life, not heaven.

985
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:05,690
You don't have to be perfect.

986
01:30:08,069 --> 01:30:11,738
Look at me. Where are those eyes? Where's the mouth?

987
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:14,449
What? You're not!

988
01:30:15,535 --> 01:30:17,285
TruLy? You're on an airplane?

989
01:30:17,370 --> 01:30:19,955
- Yeah. - Oh, my God ! Listen to me!

990
01:30:20,039 --> 01:30:22,249
I'm so exclted ! I'm yelling !

991
01:30:22,333 --> 01:30:24,334
I don't have to yell, do I?

992
01:30:24,710 --> 01:30:27,337
- No, you don't have to yell. - Henry!

993
01:30:27,547 --> 01:30:30,966
- Mom, I don't want to talk to Henry. - Where is he? Hold on.

994
01:30:31,426 --> 01:30:36,346
Henry. Where are you? Where are you? I mean, where is the airplane?

995
01:30:36,514 --> 01:30:39,015
I've never talked to anybody on an airplane before.

996
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:44,938
I was in Paris and I think I'm going to Munich.

997
01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:47,899
I don't know.

998
01:30:49,944 --> 01:30:51,528
I don't feel so good.

999
01:30:52,738 --> 01:30:55,991
Well, honey, you're probabLy just tired, you know?

1000
01:30:56,951 --> 01:30:59,953
Yeah, and I'm cold.

1001
01:31:03,207 --> 01:31:04,541
You know,

1002
01:31:06,711 --> 01:31:10,881
I was thinking about coming home again. What do you think?

1003
01:31:16,888 --> 01:31:19,431
Honey, I don't think so.

1004
01:31:20,558 --> 01:31:21,766
You know?

1005
01:31:26,481 --> 01:31:31,067
- Yeah. - I mean, you know, after the last time.

1006
01:31:32,236 --> 01:31:33,987
Yeah, I know. Of course.

1007
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:47,584
I'm sorry.

1008
01:31:51,797 --> 01:31:53,048
Yeah.

1009
01:31:58,721 --> 01:31:59,846
I better go.

1010
01:32:01,057 --> 01:32:03,266
All Right. Okay. All Right.

1011
01:32:03,434 --> 01:32:07,604
Listen to me. Now, you take care of yourself.

1012
01:32:07,688 --> 01:32:10,857
Okay? Okay. You call me.

1013
01:32:10,942 --> 01:32:13,860
- Okay. - Okay? Because I love you.

1014
01:32:14,278 --> 01:32:17,781
- Bye. - Bye- bye. Bye- bye.

1015
01:33:18,801 --> 01:33:20,844
Every model has a moment,

1016
01:33:21,971 --> 01:33:23,597
I mean, the ones who make it at all,

1017
01:33:23,681 --> 01:33:25,849
and whether or not they can parlay that moment

1018
01:33:25,933 --> 01:33:31,062
into some kind of a career, well, that's the gamble, isn't it?

1019
01:33:31,897 --> 01:33:34,149
'Cause the moment is a very short time.

1020
01:33:34,233 --> 01:33:36,776
It's here and then it's gone, just like most of these girls.

1021
01:33:37,278 --> 01:33:39,988
They're here and then they're gone.

1022
01:33:44,535 --> 01:33:48,622
when she came back to New York, I was in Philadelphia.

1023
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:51,791
And l heard some things.

1024
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:53,335
A lot of things.

1025
01:33:54,545 --> 01:33:56,796
So l took the train up to see her.

1026
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:20,737
I can't find my money.

1027
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:25,367
- What? - I had $600, and I can't find it.

1028
01:34:35,586 --> 01:34:36,878
What's going on?

1029
01:34:37,338 --> 01:34:39,339
I can't find my money!

1030
01:34:40,633 --> 01:34:42,050
What's wrong with you?

1031
01:34:43,511 --> 01:34:45,011
What are you doing?

1032
01:34:45,846 --> 01:34:49,182
- Do you have any money? - No, I don't have any money.

1033
01:34:51,102 --> 01:34:52,435
You want to fuck me?

1034
01:34:52,978 --> 01:34:53,978
Gia.

1035
01:34:55,564 --> 01:34:57,273
You give me money, I'll let you fuck me.

1036
01:35:00,277 --> 01:35:02,946
- Come here. - What?

1037
01:35:03,406 --> 01:35:04,406
No.

1038
01:35:05,408 --> 01:35:08,993
No, get off! What? No.

1039
01:35:10,287 --> 01:35:13,456
- Can I please hold you? - Get off! Get off!

1040
01:35:13,541 --> 01:35:15,583
- No drugs. - Get off!

1041
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:17,794
Get off of me!

1042
01:35:18,254 --> 01:35:19,963
- CaIm down. - Okay.

1043
01:35:20,047 --> 01:35:21,047
Okay.

1044
01:35:39,316 --> 01:35:42,777
- Okay, do you have any medicaI insurance? - No.

1045
01:35:43,654 --> 01:35:47,407
- Can you pay cash for this? - No, I don't have any money.

1046
01:35:50,619 --> 01:35:52,162
Stupid question.

1047
01:35:54,540 --> 01:35:57,208
All Right. You'll have to declare yourself indigent.

1048
01:35:57,293 --> 01:35:58,835
Do you understand that?

1049
01:36:39,794 --> 01:36:41,044
wait a minute.

1050
01:36:41,545 --> 01:36:45,256
what, am I supposed to feel sorry for you because you're beautiful?

1051
01:36:46,175 --> 01:36:49,928
Because you made 10,000 a minute doing fucking nothing?

1052
01:36:51,514 --> 01:36:56,392
"It was so hard, so terrible. They treated me so bad."

1053
01:36:56,727 --> 01:37:01,397
Listen, girl. You had a free ride and you fucking blew it.

1054
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:09,489
And me?

1055
01:37:09,907 --> 01:37:12,367
I'm some kid from Ohio,

1056
01:37:12,451 --> 01:37:16,246
reading fashion magazines, looking at your picture and thinking,

1057
01:37:16,997 --> 01:37:19,123
"I'm supposed to look like that,"

1058
01:37:19,917 --> 01:37:23,169
and going fucking crazy because I don't.

1059
01:37:23,879 --> 01:37:26,714
Because nobody told me it was a lle.

1060
01:37:26,799 --> 01:37:31,386
Because the magazine doesn't come with a label that says,

1061
01:37:31,470 --> 01:37:35,431
"Caution. This is a lle. Nobody looks like this."

1062
01:37:35,516 --> 01:37:37,183
Not even you.

1063
01:37:46,277 --> 01:37:51,155
well, they asked me to go to the sesslons, so I did. l trled.

1064
01:37:52,241 --> 01:37:55,451
I just got so mad. I got so mad.

1065
01:37:56,996 --> 01:38:00,415
I said to them, "Look, I'm not the drug addict here.

1066
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:03,877
"I'm not the one that you should be rlpping apart."

1067
01:38:05,629 --> 01:38:10,884
I said, "This is all burled. Why don't you just let it be?"

1068
01:38:10,968 --> 01:38:13,595
That's what I told 'em. Look, I know. I know.

1069
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:16,055
You want to blame somebody. You want to blame me.

1070
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:18,349
Okay, go ahead. Knock yourself out.

1071
01:38:19,727 --> 01:38:24,480
But just remember this, everything I did, I did because I loved her.

1072
01:38:25,524 --> 01:38:29,819
And I belive that it was my love and my prayers that got her through that.

1073
01:38:43,250 --> 01:38:45,126
Hi, Linda, it's Gia.

1074
01:38:45,711 --> 01:38:47,420
I'm calling to apologize.

1075
01:38:49,089 --> 01:38:51,507
I'm in this program

1076
01:38:51,592 --> 01:38:55,053
and it's, like, part of the program that we're supposed to

1077
01:38:55,137 --> 01:38:58,723
ask forgiveness of the people that we hurt when we were drugging.

1078
01:38:59,391 --> 01:39:03,394
I was like "Well fuck man. That could take the rest of my life."

1079
01:39:07,524 --> 01:39:10,193
I'm sorry. This is stupid.

1080
01:39:16,033 --> 01:39:19,786
Anyway, I'm calling to ask forgiveness

1081
01:39:19,870 --> 01:39:23,247
and to say that I miss you, because...

1082
01:39:23,457 --> 01:39:24,457
Hello?

1083
01:39:25,709 --> 01:39:28,294
what is that? Am l done?

1084
01:39:28,379 --> 01:39:30,630
l think I'm done. l don't know what happened.

1085
01:39:30,714 --> 01:39:33,049
Hi. Hi, it's me.

1086
01:39:41,266 --> 01:39:42,558
Boy, Linda.

1087
01:39:44,687 --> 01:39:45,895
Yeah.

1088
01:39:46,522 --> 01:39:47,522
Hi.

1089
01:39:53,821 --> 01:39:56,280
Well, now I don't know what to say.

1090
01:39:58,075 --> 01:40:01,995
It's okay. I heard you. I heard it all.

1091
01:40:03,372 --> 01:40:04,831
Is that okay?

1092
01:40:06,750 --> 01:40:07,875
Yeah.

1093
01:40:19,013 --> 01:40:24,684
I can't talk Right now. I have to go. Can I call you in a few days?

1094
01:40:27,896 --> 01:40:30,606
I'm gonna be out in a few days, and then I'm gonna call you, okay?

1095
01:40:30,941 --> 01:40:34,944
Okay.

1096
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:04,557
You know how she's always saying she's a model?

1097
01:41:04,641 --> 01:41:06,893
Oh, my sweet Jesus!

1098
01:41:06,977 --> 01:41:08,311
Is that her?

1099
01:41:09,772 --> 01:41:13,816
God, she's been folding the same pair of jeans for the last five minutes.

1100
01:41:17,154 --> 01:41:21,407
And that's another thing. You don't want to work in a place like that, Gia.

1101
01:41:22,034 --> 01:41:25,745
UgLy, ugLy place. UgLy people.

1102
01:41:25,829 --> 01:41:28,498
Mom, listen. This is the good part.

1103
01:41:28,999 --> 01:41:30,124
This is good.

1104
01:41:30,584 --> 01:41:34,045
Everything's gonna be really good from now on, okay?

1105
01:41:36,882 --> 01:41:37,882
Okay.

1106
01:41:41,470 --> 01:41:43,638
Look at this. Look at your skin.

1107
01:41:44,473 --> 01:41:45,640
Mom.

1108
01:41:46,183 --> 01:41:50,103
What? It's just acne. It's okay. It'll go away.

1109
01:41:50,187 --> 01:41:53,106
It's the drugs. They're coming out of my system.

1110
01:41:53,190 --> 01:41:55,316
I'm gonna look really good.

1111
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:57,443
And by Christmas, I'm gonna look great.

1112
01:41:57,945 --> 01:42:00,863
And we are gonna have the best hoilday ever.

1113
01:42:02,032 --> 01:42:03,908
Why don't you come home, huh?

1114
01:42:04,284 --> 01:42:06,744
Move back in with me. Would you like that?

1115
01:42:11,166 --> 01:42:12,166
No,

1116
01:42:13,836 --> 01:42:15,837
I gotta be alone.

1117
01:42:17,548 --> 01:42:21,384
But can you Iend me a few bucks for coffee and toothpaste?

1118
01:42:21,468 --> 01:42:23,136
The coffee!

1119
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:25,888
I'm sorry. I forgot.

1120
01:42:26,849 --> 01:42:31,144
You know, with the money you made, you could have llved the rest of your life.

1121
01:42:32,229 --> 01:42:34,438
Well, that's what happens, I suppose.

1122
01:42:38,068 --> 01:42:40,653
- What? - I'm just feeling dizzy.

1123
01:42:40,821 --> 01:42:42,238
- What is it? - Mom.

1124
01:42:43,115 --> 01:42:44,323
Gia.

1125
01:42:46,326 --> 01:42:49,412
Honey... Honey, you're burning up.

1126
01:42:50,873 --> 01:42:53,875
- Why do my ears hurt? - Baby.

1127
01:42:56,587 --> 01:42:59,589
No, no, no, no, no. Oh, my God.

1128
01:43:09,933 --> 01:43:12,643
You have pneumonia, which we can treat.

1129
01:43:14,897 --> 01:43:16,522
Gia, listen.

1130
01:43:17,691 --> 01:43:21,903
There's something more serious going on which caused your infection.

1131
01:43:22,988 --> 01:43:27,116
Something they're calling Acqulred Immune Deficlency Syndrome.

1132
01:43:28,202 --> 01:43:31,370
- Maybe you heard about it? - No.

1133
01:43:32,789 --> 01:43:34,165
How did I get it?

1134
01:43:34,708 --> 01:43:39,086
Well, we're really just finding things out and you're the first woman I've known about.

1135
01:43:39,171 --> 01:43:43,216
AIthough, intravenous drug users seem to be an especlally high- risk group.

1136
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:46,093
So you probabLy got it from a contaminated needIe.

1137
01:43:47,638 --> 01:43:49,639
How do I get rld of it?

1138
01:44:11,036 --> 01:44:12,995
But how do they know? They don't know anything about it.

1139
01:44:13,330 --> 01:44:17,291
They know, okay? They just know.

1140
01:45:15,225 --> 01:45:17,643
You know what I think?

1141
01:45:17,728 --> 01:45:20,104
I think there's a reason for everything.

1142
01:45:21,398 --> 01:45:25,109
And I think that there's a plan for everybody.

1143
01:45:26,737 --> 01:45:32,408
And I think that God has a big plan for me.

1144
01:45:33,827 --> 01:45:36,162
Just not in this life.

1145
01:45:39,583 --> 01:45:43,711
I'm on top of everything. I'm super cool.

1146
01:45:46,631 --> 01:45:48,257
You've gotten better.

1147
01:45:54,514 --> 01:45:56,057
I can't take her home.

1148
01:45:57,225 --> 01:46:00,269
I'm trying, but Henry, he's just afraid.

1149
01:46:01,063 --> 01:46:02,480
So what?

1150
01:46:03,190 --> 01:46:04,565
Dr. Blair...

1151
01:46:04,900 --> 01:46:07,735
This is your daughter. Your daughter.

1152
01:46:07,819 --> 01:46:10,821
So people are scared. I am scared.

1153
01:46:10,906 --> 01:46:14,116
He's afraid that if people find out, he could lose his job.

1154
01:46:17,871 --> 01:46:21,332
Fine. Okay, fine. Fine.

1155
01:46:23,293 --> 01:46:25,419
And where is she going to go?

1156
01:46:25,504 --> 01:46:29,548
He wants her to go to a hoteI. He says that he'll pay for it.

1157
01:46:31,635 --> 01:46:33,386
Oh, God, listen to me.

1158
01:46:35,639 --> 01:46:36,972
Listen to me.

1159
01:46:40,435 --> 01:46:44,397
Dr. Bruce, telephone, please. Dr. Bruce, telephone, please.

1160
01:46:55,158 --> 01:46:57,576
What about her father? Why can't he take her? Can he take her?

1161
01:46:57,661 --> 01:46:59,453
She doesn't want him to know.

1162
01:47:02,833 --> 01:47:05,334
I don't want to lose my baby.

1163
01:47:10,424 --> 01:47:13,884
- Kathleen. - No, I can't. I can't.

1164
01:47:24,855 --> 01:47:28,607
well, you have to understand.

1165
01:47:28,692 --> 01:47:30,651
ln those days,

1166
01:47:32,529 --> 01:47:34,196
nobody knew.

1167
01:47:41,872 --> 01:47:45,875
People were scared. I was scared.

1168
01:47:48,670 --> 01:47:51,213
She must have been scared, too.

1169
01:48:04,811 --> 01:48:08,647
Dear Linda, this is the end of my book.

1170
01:48:08,732 --> 01:48:11,942
The last page, the last shot.

1171
01:48:12,027 --> 01:48:14,695
Seeing you to say hello and goodbye.

1172
01:48:15,572 --> 01:48:20,826
Seeing you to fill up all the empty, and smell and touch,

1173
01:48:21,036 --> 01:48:23,245
and leave my kisses all over your face.

1174
01:48:26,917 --> 01:48:29,627
- Gia. - That's me.

1175
01:48:30,545 --> 01:48:33,088
Come in. Come in.

1176
01:48:37,802 --> 01:48:39,762
Do you want some tea?

1177
01:48:40,639 --> 01:48:45,226
I was so nervous about seeing you. Coffee?

1178
01:48:46,269 --> 01:48:48,395
No, I can't stay Iong.

1179
01:48:49,481 --> 01:48:50,689
Why not?

1180
01:48:54,778 --> 01:48:56,070
I have an appointment.

1181
01:48:57,822 --> 01:48:58,989
Work?

1182
01:48:59,574 --> 01:49:02,284
No. No. No more work for me.

1183
01:49:04,162 --> 01:49:06,872
I just thought we'd have more time.

1184
01:49:06,957 --> 01:49:08,499
Yeah, me, too.

1185
01:49:09,125 --> 01:49:10,459
Just not today.

1186
01:49:10,794 --> 01:49:12,044
That's okay.

1187
01:49:12,629 --> 01:49:16,257
We have all the time in the world. We'll take it.

1188
01:49:17,467 --> 01:49:19,134
Yeah, I guess so.

1189
01:49:21,137 --> 01:49:24,139
But today I just wanted to see your face.

1190
01:49:24,516 --> 01:49:25,808
I missed your face.

1191
01:49:40,156 --> 01:49:42,157
What are you going to do?

1192
01:49:45,328 --> 01:49:47,997
I don't know. I have some plans.

1193
01:49:48,123 --> 01:49:52,710
I think I might go to schooI, you know? Learn something useful maybe.

1194
01:49:54,504 --> 01:49:57,881
Maybe even settIe down and have some kids, you know?

1195
01:49:57,966 --> 01:49:59,592
What the hell?

1196
01:49:59,843 --> 01:50:01,302
Wow.

1197
01:50:02,178 --> 01:50:04,179
How straight are you now?

1198
01:50:04,598 --> 01:50:07,725
I mean, are we talking about men?

1199
01:50:08,935 --> 01:50:10,936
You don't need a husband to have kids.

1200
01:50:14,691 --> 01:50:18,360
And besides, you were the one who always had my heart, you know?

1201
01:50:23,950 --> 01:50:27,536
Yeah, I guess I did know that.

1202
01:50:33,543 --> 01:50:35,711
Would you keep these for me?

1203
01:50:38,214 --> 01:50:42,384
- Your fairy tales? - Yeah, some. A few.

1204
01:50:43,553 --> 01:50:46,597
Plus all the other crazy shit in my head.

1205
01:50:48,224 --> 01:50:52,478
I don't want to throw it away, but I just don't want it around Right now.

1206
01:50:53,897 --> 01:50:56,982
- You can read it if you want. - No, I won't.

1207
01:50:57,150 --> 01:51:01,153
No, read it. Read it. I want you to, you know?

1208
01:51:01,237 --> 01:51:05,115
Maybe you can make some sense out of it. I never could.

1209
01:51:07,077 --> 01:51:09,495
- Okay. - Okay.

1210
01:51:11,414 --> 01:51:15,042
- I'm gonna see you again, aren't I? - Yeah, you want to?

1211
01:51:15,293 --> 01:51:17,211
Yeah. Yeah.

1212
01:51:25,261 --> 01:51:30,099
You know, I was thinking about

1213
01:51:31,267 --> 01:51:34,353
getting a house at the beach this summer.

1214
01:51:34,437 --> 01:51:35,854
- Yeah? - Yeah.

1215
01:51:35,939 --> 01:51:39,566
I really thought that it would give us a chance.

1216
01:51:41,111 --> 01:51:44,780
I would like so much for us to have another chance.

1217
01:51:47,867 --> 01:51:49,868
Yeah, I'd like that, too.

1218
01:51:55,166 --> 01:51:56,166
I gotta go.

1219
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:59,795
- No, wait. I want you to stay. - Yeah.

1220
01:52:04,759 --> 01:52:05,759
Hey.

1221
01:52:12,642 --> 01:52:15,978
You were the one. You were the only one.

1222
01:52:17,480 --> 01:52:19,314
And you are amazing.

1223
01:52:34,330 --> 01:52:35,873
She...

1224
01:52:36,374 --> 01:52:38,667
She put together this money.

1225
01:52:40,128 --> 01:52:44,798
She pawned some things, borrowed some from her father,

1226
01:52:45,425 --> 01:52:48,218
stole some from Kathleen.

1227
01:52:51,514 --> 01:52:55,684
I didn't know what she was doing.

1228
01:52:56,102 --> 01:52:59,438
l should have, but I didn't.

1229
01:52:59,522 --> 01:53:02,566
It may have crossed my mind.

1230
01:53:04,110 --> 01:53:05,903
l really didn't think she would do that.

1231
01:53:08,698 --> 01:53:10,574
I really didn't.

1232
01:53:13,745 --> 01:53:16,413
Yo, Gia. How you doing?

1233
01:53:16,498 --> 01:53:20,167
- Good. Is he here? - Yeah, yeah, he's in the back.

1234
01:53:23,379 --> 01:53:24,797
- Hey. - Hey.

1235
01:53:26,216 --> 01:53:29,968
- How much you want, angeI? - As much as you've got.

1236
01:53:33,723 --> 01:53:36,517
What are you gonna do with that much stuff?

1237
01:53:38,144 --> 01:53:40,145
Well, that's my business.

1238
01:53:45,318 --> 01:53:48,487
- What, are you holding or not? - What's your hurry?

1239
01:53:49,447 --> 01:53:51,281
All Right. Come on. Yes, or no?

1240
01:53:52,659 --> 01:53:57,496
Yeah, I got what you need, and I got it Right here.

1241
01:53:58,414 --> 01:54:00,582
Yo, man, what the fuck are you doing, man?

1242
01:54:00,667 --> 01:54:03,877
- Look what Santa claus brought us. - I'm freaking out of here!

1243
01:54:03,962 --> 01:54:06,421
You get the money. I'm gonna get mine.

1244
01:54:26,609 --> 01:54:28,443
It's gonna be all right.

1245
01:54:48,172 --> 01:54:50,257
Kathleen 

1246
01:54:51,301 --> 01:54:53,302
what are you doing here?

1247
01:55:10,445 --> 01:55:13,322
I'm gonna take you home, baby.

1248
01:55:19,287 --> 01:55:23,749
She wouldn't let anybody see her, but l went anyway.

1249
01:55:24,500 --> 01:55:26,835
l saw her once.

1250
01:55:27,962 --> 01:55:29,546
But I did see her.

1251
01:55:30,006 --> 01:55:34,009
- l don't think she knew it was me. - No more than five minutes, okay?

1252
01:55:35,595 --> 01:55:40,140
I couldn't help thinking to myself, "My God, she's just a kid."

1253
01:55:41,225 --> 01:55:43,685
I blame myself, you know?

1254
01:55:44,938 --> 01:55:47,940
I mean, these are chlldren.

1255
01:55:49,359 --> 01:55:55,238
No matter how screwed up our llves may be we've got to take care of our chlldren.

1256
01:56:08,753 --> 01:56:10,587
She knew she was dying.

1257
01:56:11,047 --> 01:56:13,632
She said she wanted to do it Right.

1258
01:56:13,716 --> 01:56:16,301
She wanted to get a video camera

1259
01:56:16,970 --> 01:56:21,098
and do this thing where she talked to kids about drugs.

1260
01:56:22,433 --> 01:56:24,559
She wanted to tell kids

1261
01:56:25,478 --> 01:56:27,771
that you can handle it.

1262
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:31,817
You can handle anything that comes your way.

1263
01:56:34,404 --> 01:56:36,738
But we never got the camera.

1264
01:56:47,125 --> 01:56:51,420
You do be the prettiest, prettiest girl.

1265
01:56:52,630 --> 01:56:54,589
You do be that.

1266
01:56:55,425 --> 01:56:57,092
Do I?

1267
01:56:57,927 --> 01:57:01,471
Do I be the prettiest?

1268
01:57:02,473 --> 01:57:03,473
Yeah.

1269
01:57:04,684 --> 01:57:05,684
No.

1270
01:57:17,321 --> 01:57:19,531
Do you forgive me, Kathleen?

1271
01:57:23,244 --> 01:57:24,870
Oh, honey.

1272
01:57:26,831 --> 01:57:31,251
Yeah.

1273
01:57:33,588 --> 01:57:35,213
Of course I do.

1274
01:57:41,137 --> 01:57:43,638
Because I forgive you, too.

1275
01:57:48,144 --> 01:57:49,770
Baby.

1276
01:58:00,156 --> 01:58:01,323
What's this?

1277
01:58:07,497 --> 01:58:08,747
What is it?

1278
01:58:09,415 --> 01:58:10,665
Oh, my God.

1279
01:58:14,212 --> 01:58:15,921
Nurse? Nurse!

1280
01:58:16,339 --> 01:58:18,465
- Where are you going, Mom? - Nurse!

1281
01:58:19,842 --> 01:58:21,510
Mom?

1282
01:58:22,637 --> 01:58:24,596
Where you going?

1283
01:58:31,354 --> 01:58:33,772
She died around 1 0:00 in the morning.

1284
01:58:34,482 --> 01:58:36,191
They trled to pick her...

1285
01:58:37,068 --> 01:58:39,569
They trled to pick her up off the bed, and she...

1286
01:58:40,196 --> 01:58:42,989
The flesh just fell off her back. It just fell off.

1287
01:58:44,075 --> 01:58:46,034
You don't want to hear about that.

1288
01:58:48,496 --> 01:58:50,956
Okay, what else? What else?

1289
01:58:58,673 --> 01:59:02,759
Yeah, this is it. This is what I was looking for.

1290
01:59:04,428 --> 01:59:09,975
"And the people said, 'Oh, she's not beautiful at all.'

1291
01:59:10,059 --> 01:59:14,479
"And they took her from the beautiful house and they drove her into the street.

1292
01:59:15,398 --> 01:59:19,776
"And she went away and she never came back.

1293
01:59:23,489 --> 01:59:28,660
"And soon, people became hungry again and they went back into the beautiful house

1294
01:59:28,744 --> 01:59:32,455
"looking for gold, but there was no one there."

1295
01:59:34,542 --> 01:59:38,962
They say she knew. She really knew. She knew the whole story.

1296
01:59:41,841 --> 01:59:45,093
we found an undertaker, and it was hard, believe me,

1297
01:59:45,178 --> 01:59:48,430
you know, because of the AIDS.

1298
01:59:48,723 --> 01:59:51,683
I didn't want people to remember her like that

1299
01:59:51,767 --> 01:59:53,685
because I didn't want people to see her like that.

1300
01:59:53,769 --> 02:00:00,108
I wanted them to remember her as beautiful, because that's what she really was.

1301
02:00:41,484 --> 02:00:44,027
Life and death,

1302
02:00:44,111 --> 02:00:46,321
energy and peace.

1303
02:00:46,864 --> 02:00:49,908
If I stop today, it was still worth it.

1304
02:00:49,992 --> 02:00:55,497
Even the terrible mistakes that I have made and would have unmade if I could.

1305
02:00:55,581 --> 02:00:59,042
The pains that have burned me and scarred my soul.

1306
02:00:59,126 --> 02:01:00,752
It was worth it

1307
02:01:00,836 --> 02:01:03,755
for having been allowed to walk where I've walked,

1308
02:01:03,839 --> 02:01:07,926
which was to hell on Earth, heaven on Earth,

1309
02:01:08,010 --> 02:01:13,848
back again, into, under, far in between, through it,

1310
02:01:13,933 --> 02:01:16,226
in it and above.
