1
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:14,334
他們說她知道 她的確知道她知道所有的事
They say she knew. She really knew. She knew the whole story.

2
00:00:14,424 --> 00:00:17,384
在八十年代初她成為時裝界的傳奇

3
00:00:17,394 --> 00:00:20,384
本片是根據認識她的人對她的描述

4
00:00:20,394 --> 00:00:24,354
和她自己寫的日記拍攝而成

5
00:00:43,164 --> 00:00:46,754
主演：安吉麗娜朱莉

6
00:00:48,464 --> 00:00:51,834
片名：吉婭

7
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:59,892
那時 每個模特都長得比較高 比較瘦 都是金發碧眼的可人兒
At that time, everybody was tall, thin and blonde.

8
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:04,480
她們都會擺出一個姿勢 朝著你看
Everybody posed, everybody gave you a look.

9
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:07,066
但吉婭不同
But Gia was different.

10
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:11,153
她是第一個能做不斷地擺出各種姿勢
She was the first one who... Who moved.

11
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:16,992
現在的模特都會這樣做讓你能夠 選出一個最好的 但她是第一個
They all try to do it now, give you an attitude, but she invented it.

12
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:19,578
她總是隨心所欲...
She always followed her instincts

13
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:23,082
不管在哪里
no matter where they took her.

14
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:27,044
這也許她最好的一面但也許也 正是最糟糕的一面
It was probably the best and the worst thing about her.

15
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:31,340
說到吉婭總離不開性
with Gia, it was always about the sex.

16
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:36,553
每一個眼神 每一個動作 每一分鐘 每一天
Every look, every move, every minute. Every day.

17
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,015
都離不開性
Sex.

18
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:44,978
他們妒忌她現在也是 那就是為什么他們總愛談論這個
They were jealous of her. They still are. That's why they say those things.

19
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:49,942
她的確與很多人睡過但這并不意昧著什么
She would come on to everybody, but it was really innocent.

20
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:53,529
我是說 并沒有人真正因這些被冒犯了
I mean, nobody was ever really offended by it.

21
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,657
我不認為這一切與性有關
I don't think it had anything to do with sex.

22
00:01:57,033 --> 00:02:00,786
她不是為了性才與人上床的性不是目的
Even when she was sleeping around, sex was not the goal.

23
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,288
性真的不是問題
Sex wasn't really an issue.

24
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,041
是 我知道關于吸毒的事
Yeah, I knew about the drugs.

25
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:10,838
對于吸毒的人 我總是很擔心
I was afraid of the drugs, the way people used them.

26
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,048
一切發生得那么快
It all just happened so fast.

27
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,717
一切都來得那么突然到處都 可以看到她的照片
You know, all of a sudden, her face was just everywhere.

28
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:20,556
每個模特都會有那么一瞬間一我指的是 造出那精彩一剎那的人
Every model has a moment. I mean, the ones who make it at all.

29
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:24,726
在那一瞬間 那人的一切都成為了時尚
And being of the moment is everything in fashion.

30
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:29,898
時尚不是藝朮時尚也談不上是文化
Fashion is not art, you know. Fashion isn't even culture.

31
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,860
時尚只是廣告...
Fashion is advertising,

32
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:35,404
而廣告就意昧著錢
and advertising is money.

33
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:40,826
你花出的每一塊錢都會有所回報
And for every dollar you earn, someone has to pay.

34
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:16,486
很久很久以前很久很久以前
Once upon a time, once upon a time.

35
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,992
有一個神話
It was a fairy tale.

36
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,038
這個神話后來變成了現實
It was. It was a fairy tale come true.

37
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,710
我有兩個兒子 你知道他兒子總會離開你
I had two boys, you know, but boys you lose.

38
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:36,006
他們走了 與別的女人結婚了他們離開你了
They go away, they marry other women. They're gone.

39
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,217
而女兒會一直留在你身邊
A girl, you have forever.

40
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:42,054
當吉婭出生時我說：
When Gia was born, I said, "This one is mine."

41
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:45,432
- 看看 - 她是我的
- Look at you. - "All mine."

42
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,227
看看我
Look at me.

43
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,728
看看我們倆
Look at us.

44
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,482
我們多么漂亮啊
Look how pretty we are.

45
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:58,237
我是不是一我是不是最漂亮的?是的
Do I be? Do I be the prettiest, prettiest girl?

46
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:02,616
你是最漂亮的 是的
You do. You do be the prettiest. You do be that.

47
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,374
- 你到底是上哪里去了? - 外面
- Where the hell have you been? - Out.

48
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:14,836
- 外面?外面?外面哪兒? - 外面
- Out? Out? Out where? - Out.

49
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,421
哦 喬伊 別這樣
Joe, don't start.

50
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,715
別對我說 “別這樣”外面哪兒?告訴我你上哪兒去了
Don't tell me, "Don't start." Out where? Tell me where you've been.

51
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,260
- 喬伊 小聲點 - 別叫我小聲點
- Joe, lower your voice. - Don't tell me to lower my voice.

52
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,928
孩子們要知道你今晚上哪里去了
The kids know you haven't been home all night.

53
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,388
- 住口 - 告訴他們你上哪兒去了
- Cut it out! - Tell them where you've been.

54
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,515
今晚我沒心情說
I'm not in the mood for this tonight, Joe.

55
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,892
沒心情 嗯 ?
Not in the mood, huh?

56
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,353
- 離我遠點 - 誰和你在一起 凱西里恩 ?
- Just leave me alone. - Who were you with, Kathleen?

57
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,437
這不關你的事
It's none of your business.

58
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,439
別這樣對我說話 你這個裱子
Don't tell me it's none of my business you fucking whore.

59
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,483
- 滾出廚房 - 讓我看看 他是不是干過你了
- Get out. Get out of the kitchen. - Let me see. Did he fuck you?

60
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:37,818
- 住手 - 他干過你沒有?
- Stop! - Let me see. Did he fuck you?

61
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:40,279
- 哪里?讓我也感受一下 - 豬！把你的手拿開！
- Where? Let me feel! - Pig ! Get your hands off!

62
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,781
- 除了我還有誰干過那個地方? - 把你的手拿開！變態佬
- Who else has been in there besides me? - Get your hands off of me, jerk.

63
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,700
- 還有誰?嗯? - 你知道你令我想做什么嗎?
- Who else, huh? - You know how you make me feel?

64
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,411
- 你讓我想去死 你知道嗎? - 你想死?不！
- You make me wanna die. You know that? - You wanna die? No!

65
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,371
你不能死 除非是我要你死
You don't die until I tell you you can die.

66
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,456
你才能死 明白嗎?
That's when you die, God damn it, you hear me?

67
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,000
我要你死你才能死！
That's when you die!

68
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:09,182
把這個也放到后車箱里這個我拿著
Here, take this and put it in the car. I'll keep this one.

69
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,197
很久很久以前...
Once upon a time

70
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,784
在一個很遠很遠的王國...
in a kingdom far, far away

71
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,078
那兒住著一個小女孩...
there lived a young girl

72
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,331
有著一頭金發
whose hair was made of gold.

73
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,250
那個村里的人看到她 他們會說...
when the people in the village saw her,

74
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,211
“哦 她多美啊”
they said, "How beautiful she is."

75
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:42,299
一份牛排干酪 一份肉丸 一份意大利腸 加波蘿伏洛干酪
All Right, one cheesesteak, one meatball, one salami- provoIone.

76
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,343
在這里盯著 我到4:00回來
Keep your eye on the shop, I'll be back by 4:00.

77
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,928
就別把這里給燒了
Try not to burn the place down huh?

78
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:50,307
- 吉婭 你負責這里的一切 - 沒問題 
- Gia, you're in charge. - All Right, boss.

79
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,812
嘿 拿好了走開 別擋道
Hey, get the food, get the food. Go, come on, come on, get outta here.

80
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,149
- 把錢收好了 你干什么? - 現在我負責
- Get the cash register. What are you doing? - I'm in charge!

81
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,860
- 嘿 - 你叫吉婭?
- Hey. - Is your name Gia?

82
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,946
對
Yeah.

83
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,576
- 有火嗎? - 別搞亂了
- Got a llght? - Stop screwing around.

84
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,496
我在附近見過你几次...
I've seen you a few times around the neighborhood and...

85
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,081
并且一你很緊張嗎?
Are you nervous?

86
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,458
是的
Yeah.

87
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,002
我令你感到緊張了?
Am I making you nervous?

88
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,630
是的
Yeah.

89
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,511
噢 那不錯這正是我想要的
Well, good, 'cause that's the idea.

90
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,848
- 你說什么? - 你嚇到了周圍的人...
- What's that? - You scare the shit out of people

91
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,601
而他們通常并不知道你有多可怕
and then they don't see how scared you are.

92
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,188
你有多可怕?
Are you scared?

93
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,819
你叫什么名字?
What's your name?

94
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:49,491
T.J.湯姆但人們通常叫我T.J
T.J. Tom Junior, but T.J. is what they call me.

95
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,289
T.J. 和吉婭
T.J. and Gia.

96
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,751
我喜歡 跟我來
I like that. Come on.

97
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,838
- 我走了等一下 - 你上哪兒去?
- I'm leaving. - Hey, Gia, wait a minute. Where you going?

98
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:06,425
- 現在我說了算 我要走了 - 吉婭
- I'm in charge, and I'm leaving. - Gia.

99
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:12,180
- 這是比亞斯的嗎? - 他們太棒了
- Is that The Byrds? - They're so cool.

100
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,225
喔 我太喜歡了
Wow. Rock my world.

101
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,186
75美分?
Seventy- five cents?

102
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:23,817
好漂亮 漂亮 太漂亮了
It's pretty. Pretty. Very pretty.

103
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,485
你好 小姐
Hello, ladies.

104
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,821
這個能給我嗎?來
Can I have this? Come on.

105
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,323
- 嘿 - 嘿
- Hey. - Hey.

106
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,660
紋身?
- Tattoo? - Tattoos.

107
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,620
- 是給你紋身 - 你現在要紋身?
- Tattoo you. - You getting a tattoo now?

108
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,122
不 給你紋身
No, tattoo you.

109
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:41,668
我不會去紋身的 來吧 什么?
- I'm not getting a tattoo. - Come on. What? What?

110
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,712
看看那頭發太怪了
Look at that hair. It's fabulous.

111
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,887
你現在想紋身了嗎?
You want a tattoo now?

112
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,475
她一定很會玩
She'd be a Iot of fun.

113
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,857
你們在看誰?他還是我?
So who are you looking at, him or me?

114
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,668
哦 我不想談論性
I can't talk about the sex.

115
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,838
我是說 我怎么會知道
I mean, how would I know?

116
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:54,843
如果你一定要問那她從未與任何人 有過真正的性關系
If you ask me, she never really had sex with anybody.

117
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,431
不過她的確很喜歡拍照...
But she did love to be photographed,

118
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,976
人們也樂于為她拍照為她做些什么
and people loved to take pictures of her and do little things for her.

119
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,853
她不喜歡被人拍照
She hated being photographed.

120
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:10,358
你必須追著她把她綁住了才行
You had to run after her and tie her down.

121
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:15,655
你得幫他解開衣服拿掉頭發上的東西
Then you had to get past the clothes and the stuff in her hair.

122
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,700
但她很不一般
But she was special.

123
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,609
走吧
Kathleen, Let's go.

124
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,445
來了 來了
Coming, coming.

125
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,951
好了 我們走吧
All Right, Let's go.

126
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:20,595
他們讓她看了一幢漂亮的房子... 在火星上的
And they showed her a beautiful house on the planet Mars.

127
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:25,058
然后對她說“永遠住在這里吧”
And they said, "Come and live here forever."

128
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,310
那個小女孩說...
And the young girl said,

129
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:31,272
"哦 在火星上生活真是不一樣啊
"Mars is a planet where life's different.

130
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:35,735
安全 干淨 美好 ' '
"Safe, clean and pretty." Yes.

131
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,864
但一但怎么才能到那里呢?
But... But how do you get there?

132
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:43,993
坐計程車嗎?還是坐哪輛公車?
where do you find a taxi? which bus do you take?

133
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:47,831
好 就算你到了那里你又怎么 知道你已經到了?
Right? And how do you know you're there when you're there?

134
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:52,252
費城不適合她
Philadelphia was not ready for this,

135
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,463
但紐約不一樣
but New York was.

136
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,012
就是那一刻...
It was the Right moment,

137
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:07,976
那一刻一切成為了時尚
and being of the moment is everything in fashion.

138
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:12,313
當然你越是時尚...
But of course, the more you were of the moment,

139
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:15,358
你也就會越快過時
the faster you become of the past.

140
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,325
好吧 就從這里開始
Okay, Let's get this over with.

141
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:27,746
只要走進去盡要表現得友好些
Just go in there and try to be nice.

142
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,581
- 友好? - 是的
- Nice? - Yeah.

143
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:30,665
友好
Nice.

144
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,543
誰知道他們也許會喜歡上你
Who knows? Maybe they'll like you.

145
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,589
你是個很討人喜歡的女孩子去你的
- You are a very likable girl. - Fuck you.

146
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:41,676
好吧

找個座位坐吧
Take a seat.

151
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,404

152
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,741

153
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,368

159
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,770
能記住嗎寶貝?
Do you think you can remember that, honey?

160
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:37,565
是嗎?很好現在告訴那條母狗我在這里
Yeah? cool. Now tell the bitch I'm here.

161
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:48,284
我已經看過照片了 親愛的莫里斯寄給我了
I've already seen the pictures, darling.Morris  sent them.

162
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,245
我想見見真人
I wanted to see the real thing.

163
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,080
好啊 我現在就在這里
Well, this is it.

164
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,707
的確
It certainly is.

165
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:58,419
你把我的接待員嚇壞了
You practically gave my receptionist a coronary.

166
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:04,217
是的 好吧 你看 我到紐約來...
Yeah, well, look. This was a free trlp to New York,

167
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:07,512
如果我知道你要找的是他媽的賤貨瑪瑞什么的...
and if I knew you were looking for Marcla- fucking- Brady,

168
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:08,638
我寧愿呆在家里
I would've stayed home.

169
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,808
你怎么知道我要的是什么樣的人?
How do you know what I'm looking for?

170
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:21,276
看著我......我是在看 正在看
- Well, fuck, look at me. - I'm looking, I'm looking.

171
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:26,030
你知道 穿得象個飛女...
You know, dressing like a motorcycle tramp

172
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:29,117
可能會讓一個17歲的女孩看起來很有意思
is somewhat interesting for a 17-year-old girl.

173
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,620
但說話也這樣就不好了
Talking like one is not.

174
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:37,584
事實上 做模特不用說話...
In fact, talking at all is not really requlred in this professlon

175
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,669
甚至不希望她們說話
or even encouraged.

176
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:44,382
你不用對著相機 畫面說什么
Anything you might have to say you say through the camera, the image,

177
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,468
渴望成名就行了
and hopefully the product.

178
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:51,139
你所說的都是無關緊要的
What comes out of your mouth is totally irrelevant.

179
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,974
明白嗎?
Understood?

180
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:54,934
是的
Yes, sir.

181
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:00,064
這里是一份事業
Now, this is a career,

182
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,150
這是未來
this is a future,

183
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,652
是一種生活...
this is a life

184
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,280
如果你要的話
if you want it.

185
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,616
你是不是說你能給我一份工作?
Does that mean you can get me a job?

186
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,159
不
No.

187
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,496
不 我只是接見了你
I get you the interviews,

188
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,916
你得自己找到工作
you get the job.

189
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,340
我相信你能行
And I belive you will.

190
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,552
親愛的 這就是我的生活
Dear Diary, this is my life.

191
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:33,056
拜訪楊和羅賓卡姆 9:45

192
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,267
到露華濃拜訪某人 11:15
Go see people at Revlon, 11 :1 5.

193
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:40,730
拜訪吉米摩爾 鮑勃斯通 著名的Malowinksi...
Go see Jimmy Moore, Bob Stone, somebody "Malowinksl,"

194
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:44,817
然后...”不行 寶貝 你不是我們要找的‘'
and "Get lost, honey. You ain't what we're lookin' for."

195
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,738
- 下一個 - 謝謝 你媽的 再見
- Next! - Thank you and fuck you. Bye- bye.

196
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:53,117
是的 我不斷地拜訪可沒有人看我一眼
Yeah, I go see, I go see. Nobody sees me.

197
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:57,455
“啊 小事一件 到這邊來 轉過去讓我瞧瞧你后面”
"Piece of meat, come here. Show me your bag."

198
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,624
然后他們把手指插入你體內
And they stick their finger in you.

199
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,210
”我只是想測測你的體溫 "
"I just wanna taste your temperature."

200
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:05,880
拜訪 拜訪 拜訪 不斷地拜訪
Go see, go see, go see, go see somebody else.

201
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,801
我不適合這個 這根本就不適合我
I ain't no good at this. I ain't no good at this at all.

202
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:14,430
但即使你適合你真的能行嗎?
But even if you are good at it, what exactly are you good at?

203
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:19,852
- 你不可以走 - 我必須走了
- You can't leave now. - I have to go.

204
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,563
什么?什么?去費城?
What, what? To Philadelphia?

205
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,733
- 去做什么? - 我有事
- For what? - I got stuff.

206
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,277
我必須走
I have to go.

207
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:33,741
我得有人照顧才行我還只是個孩子

208
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:34,951

209
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,671
費城有什么?有比我更重要的嗎?
What's in Philadelphia that's more important than me?

210
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,467
- 別那樣 - 別怎么樣?
- Do not do that. - Do not do what?

211
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,597
別假裝你要去做什么而你實際上并不想去做
Do not pretend you're gonna do something when you know you're not.

212
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,932
我想做什么了?
What am I not gonna do?

213
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:20,955
還有什么?
What else?

214
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:34,802

親愛的布克 這是生活的又一天
Dear Book, this is another day in the life.

228
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,319
生活就象一本書書就象是一只盒子
A life is like a book. A book is like a box.

229
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:19,073
一個盒子有六個面還有里面和外面
A box has slx sides, inside and outside.

你怎么能把里面的東西拿出來?
How do you get what's inside out?

232

If he ever lays a hand on you, I'll fucking kllI him.

249
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,638
你為什么睡不著?

264
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:29,745

267
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:50,099
- 她撒謊 - 哦 別這樣

270
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,703

271
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,206
你遲到了去洗個臉
You're late. Go wash your face.

272
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:59,710

I already did. It's nice to meet you, too.

273
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,966
要我幫你洗嗎?
What the hell am I gonna do with you?

274
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,427
讓我來
I got it.

275
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:14,308
我不知道我只是個從費城來的小姑娘
I don't know. I'm just some dumb girl from PhllLy.

276
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,812
天啊 她是頭野獸
Oh, my God, she's a beast.

277
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,438
她讓我感到害怕
She scares me.

278
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:22,733
她有沒有令你想到你母親?
Why, Phllllpe, does she remind you of your mother?

279
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:27,029
沒有 倒是讓我想起了我兄弟 謝天謝地 他現在在牢里
No, she reminds me of my brother. He's in jall now, thank Jesus.

280
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:30,741
好
Okay.

281
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:42,878
什么?
What?

282
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,382
不錯
It's wonderful.

283
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,385
讓我們來看看這張臉
Let's see this face.

284
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:56,434
我在看你是否要去拔黑頭粉刺
I'm checking to see if you need to be tweezed.

285
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,436

287
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:04,567

288
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,362
真丑
AbsoIuteLy horrendous.

289
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:11,782
露多點牙出來
More teeth.

290
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:16,620
每一張照片都是一個承諾不用守的承諾
Every photograph makes a promise, and the promise is never kept.

291
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,706
看智力損害
Look brain damaged.

292
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,541
這就是照片的偉大之所在
That's what makes a photo great.

293
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,879
而如果那個承諾是性...
And if the promise is sex,

294
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:31,177
- 而你又從中得到了什么 - 好
- then you really have something. - Good.

295
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,095
很好
Wonderful.

296
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:35,973
好了...
Well,

297
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,017
真是一堆狗屎
that was all shit.

298
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,644
- 去你媽的 - 去拿錢吧
- Fuck you. - Now we can pay our rent.

299
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:43,189
誰愿意留下來創造點藝朮的
Who wants to stay and make some art?

300
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,608
什么樣的藝朮?
What's art?

301
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:49,236
留在圍欄后面把衣服脫光
Keep the fence, lose the clothes.

302
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,280
不 謝謝 我要走了
No, thanks, I'm gone.

303
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:54,074

304
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:01,999
如果琳達留下的話我就留下
I'll stay if Linda stays.

305
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,453
- 琳達? - 什么事?
- Linda, Liebling? - Yeah.

306
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,582
到圍欄那邊去
Go stand by the fence.

307
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,961
- 你想把我也拍到照片里去? - 是 是 是
- You want me in the shot? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

308
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,797
你也把衣服脫了
And lose the clothes.

309
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:27,246
性一性真的很簡單 
Sex... Sex was really easy. It was...

310
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:32,668
到處都是性但性又并不是真的很多
Sex was everywhere. It didn't really mean too much.

311
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:36,463
愛這樣東西是很難找的
Love... Love was the hard thing to find.

312
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:44,805
太多人并不佣有愛 即使你找到了
Even if you were looking for it, which not too many people were.

313
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:53,564
即使它就是你面前
Even if you found it, which not too many people did.

314
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:58,819
你又怎能保証這就是你想要的?
Even if it was Right there in front of you 

315
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:06,493
你如何讓性一直存在呢?
how could you see it with all the sex in the way?

316
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:02,424
嘿 你上哪兒去?
Hey, where you going?

317
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,301

Gia.

318
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:07,221
發生什么事了?怎么了?
What happened? What's the matter?

319
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:10,140
你怎么沒穿衣服
You don't have any clothes on.

320
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,727
說正題吧
Don't change the subject.

321
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:17,105
我有男朋友
I have a boyfriend.

322
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,525

So?

323
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,444
我要走了
So, I have to go.

"I have to go, I have to go." Everybody has to go.

325
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:29,409
大家都他媽的要去哪里?
Where the fuck does everybody go when they have to go, huh?

326
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:34,039

You... You and I had a...

327
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:36,375
我是說 是說...我有...
I mean, it was... I had a...

328
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,086
我不知道
I don't know.

329
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:44,591
我是真心的
I'm really very square.

330
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,052

00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:53,517
求你別走

334
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,109

356
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:36,995
保羅

357
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,542
把這該死的欄杆放下

How do you know my name?

361
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:53,220
我是神 我什么都知道

362
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,222
你看?人人都知道你的名字
You see? Even God knows your name.

363
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:58,183
長著這么一張漂亮的臉蛋她根本不需要名字
With a face like that, she doesn't need a name.

364
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:02,229
事實上 托尼 我的臉的確長得不錯

Not that that ever stopped me.

373
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,981
只要添添他的屁股
A little tongue up his ass,

他就是你的了

你踩到屎了 不是嗎?
You're full of shit, aren't you?

376
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:01,788

Look, sometimes even I don't belive it, but it's all true.

377
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,624

我們從不談論過去的事一切都過去了
And we never talked about the past. That was over.

428
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:55,165
過去就是過去她從未和我談論過過去的事
The past was the past. She never discussed it with me once.

429
00:38:56,083 --> 00:39:00,086
就好象一切都沒發生過
It was like it never happened, all those years in between.

就好象一切都沒發生過
It was like it never happened.

431

所有你寄給我的東西

448

我站在客廳當中...
So, I was standing in the middle of the living room,

456

00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:26,342
你有的只是痛苦
You have pain.

540
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:32,473
當你什么都有的時候...
When you have everything,

541
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,684
你還有什么?
what do you have?

542
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:37,562
你其實什么都沒有
You have nothing.

543
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:42,942
看上去什么都是好好的 其實沒一樣是對的
When everything is Right, everything is wrong.

544
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,487
令人失望令人困惑
It's disappointing. It's confusing.

545
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:51,075
這就是生活你能做些什么?
This is life. What can you do?

546
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:56,706
大家都離開我了 這讓我很難過
People keep going away from me. That hurts.

547
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:01,294
工作
Work.

548
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,921
工作 你有這個天賦
Work. You have a gift.

549
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:05,464
好好地利用它
Use it.

550
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,551
生活很快就會美好起來的
Life... Life will be there later.

551
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:13,598
當你工作過活過了...
When you've worked, and you've llved,

552
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:17,310
你就會真正了解你自己 生活就是那么簡單
and you know who you are, life is easy.

553
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:20,396
工作
Work.

554
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,566
這是我唯一知道的答案
It's the only answer I know.

555
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,403
要不是因為我不會唱歌
I should've been a rock star.

556
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:31,157
我早就成為搖滾明星了
But I can't sing.

557
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:36,871
現在工作吧
Work now.

558
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:38,915
工作以后你就會好過些
You can llve later.

559
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:45,254
你說那么多就是為了要我去干活
You'd say anything to get that shot. Yeah?

560
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,632
- 是的 - 是的
- Yes. - Yes.

561
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:50,009
可我說的都是真心話
In this case, I'm saying the truth.

562
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:54,764
甜心
Sweetheart.

563
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:58,476
畫面應該是這樣你們都恨吉婭...
Now here's the picture. You girls all hate Gia

564
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,103
因為她比你們當中任何一個都漂亮
because she is so much prettier than the rest of you.

565
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:06,359
你們是那么地讓人感到無趣而她則充滿了激情
And you're all so Boring. She is so exclting.

566
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:11,113
如果你們不愛聽就當我沒說好了
If you don't like it, please, vanish from my world.

567
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:13,366
抱歉她現在沒空
No, I'm sorry, she's not avallable.

568
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:15,159
我知道 但是不行...
l know, darling. You can't get...

569
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:17,662
她住進了漂亮的大房子...
And she went to live in a beautiful house

570
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:21,290
大家都喜歡她 她非常地高興
and all the people loved her, and she was very, very happy.

571
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:25,044
不 她去羅馬了 她正在米蘭拍攝...
No, she's on her way to Rome then. She's shooting Versace in MIlan

572
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:27,672
然后是去巴黎
and Yves Saint Laurent in Paris.

573
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:30,549
在巴黎是她的自由之地
Perry has her for the only runway show she's doing.

574
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:33,177
但是村里的人都很窮...
But the people in the village were very poor,

575
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:36,555
他們會在她熟睡的時候爬進她的屋子...
and every night, they crept into the house where the girl slept

576
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:41,060
割下她的金頭發...然后拿去賣錢
and they cut off a piece of her golden hair and they sold it for money.

577
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:44,480
“他永遠不會注意到的” 他們說
"She'll never even notice," they said.

578
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:48,150
也因此 她的金發一天天地少去
And so, all the gold was gone from her head.

579
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,152
這是一個真實的灰姑娘式的故事
It's a real cinderella story.

580
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:59,578
- 叫他快點 - 我的機票哪去了?
- Tell him to hurry. Where's my tickets? - You are wired.

581
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:03,582
給 試試這個
Here. Try some of this.

582
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,878
這是什么?
What? What is it?

583
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:11,215
你試了就知道了
The answer to all your prayers.

584
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:56,260
你唯一要記住的就是：那不是你
The only thing you have to remember is that it's not about you.

585
00:50:56,470 --> 00:51:00,389
他們看到的不是真正的你
lt's not about you. lt's not you that they're looking at.

586
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:02,516
那不是你
It's not about you.

587
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:06,520
我現在是金牌模特我知道這點
I'm on top of that. I understand that.

588
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:09,815
寶貝 這很好 很高興你能那么說
Honey, that's good. I'm so glad about that.

589
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:14,987
如果你認為你塑造的人物就是你自己的話那你就慘了 知道嗎?
Because if you let it be about you, then you're screwed, you know.

590
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:18,824
所以你得暫時離開一段時間...
So, you have to stay separate from what's happening

591
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,910
去個什么地方
and you have to be somewhere else.

592
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:24,914
但我不知道該去哪兒你說去那兒好?
But I don't know where that somewhere else is, you know?

593
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:26,457
或者該做什么?
Or how to do that.

594
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:30,461
寶貝 你現在想做什么都行
Honey, you can do whatever you want now.

595
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:33,839
是嗎?那我到底想要什么呢?
Yeah? What is it I want?

596
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:36,300
我想要什么呢?
What do I want?

597
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:54,860
我會成為國王而你則是王后
I will be king, and you will be queen.

598
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:11,001
我不認為女人就一定是個真正意義上的女人...除非是個金發的 你懂的
I don't think a woman is really a woman unless she's a bIonde, you know.

599
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:18,217
反響很熱烈啊我從未遇到過這種情況
Response is so enormous. I've never seen anything like it.

600
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:20,761
好快啊 不是嗎?
And so fast, huh?

601
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:24,140
這個月有成上百萬的人想為你拍攝
About a million people want to shoot you this month.

602
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:28,060
我們要以你的名字來命名整個電話線路：吉婭
We're going to name a whole phone line after you. Gia.

603
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,564
我想學攝影
I could Iearn photography.

604
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:33,858
這應該是我想要做的
That could be something to want. I could...

605
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:36,235
我可以為孩子拍照
I could photograph chlldren.

606
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:39,780
我會有我自己的孩子
I could have my own chlldren.

607
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:42,658
我會送給他們黃玫瑰
I would give them yellow roses.

608
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:48,205
如果他們太吵了我會帶他們去一個能夠讓他們安靜的地方
And if they got too Ioud, I would just put them someplace quiet.

609
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:51,083
我會把他們放到烤箱里
I'd put them in the oven.

610
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:54,920
我會每天給他們一個吻
And I would kiss them every day

611
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:59,925
并告訴他們‘’你不必出名...
and tell them, "You don't have to be anybody,"

612
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:05,431
因為我知道 所謂名人其實什么都不是 ' '
because I would know that being somebody doesn't make you anybody anyway.

613
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:11,103
你對我來說永遠是最重要的
You will always be somebody to me.

614
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:13,772
永遠是最重要的
You will always be somebody to me.

615
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:17,401
在財政方面 威廉敏娜庫伯
And on the financlal front, with the sudden illness of wilhelmina Cooper,

616
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:19,445
因病前往曼哈頓就醫...
who's still hospitalized in Manhattan,

617
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:38,297
她現在一切都好 你知道他們還要對她做些檢查
She's doing all Right. You know, they're running some more tests.

618
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:40,216
也許再過一兩天我們就能知道結果了
Maybe in a day or two, then we'll know something.

619
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,386
你得幫幫我我現在壓力很大
Come on, you gotta heIp me here. I'm under a Iot of pressure.

620
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:46,263
我沒法給你確切答案
I can't give you any answers.

621
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:47,932
吉婭
Gia,

622
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:51,644
我最近一直在考慮關于你的事情
I've been thinking a Iot about you lateLy.

623
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:54,480
真是太糟糕了 太糟糕了
It's terrible, terrible, isn't it?

624
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:58,776
我是邁克曼斯菲爾德 新的拉戈代理
Mike MansfieId, starting up the new Largo Agency.

625
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,695
你想一想現在打算怎么辦?
What do you think you're gonna do now?

626
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:03,447
你這話是什么意思?
What do you mean?

627
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:06,325
嗯 你是個特別的姑娘
Well, you're a special girl

628
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:09,328
有著特別問題...
with special problems.

629
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:12,248
我想你應該得到特別的關注
I think you need special attention.

630
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:14,917
你可以去福特
You could go to Ford

631
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,753
雖然那兒與上層集團一樣是個鬼地方
and there's always that asshoIe over at Ellte.

632
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:22,883
但我想你應該考慮一下到我們這邊來
But I think you should put some serious thought into coming with me.

633
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:25,344
為什么?我為什么要離開維利 ?
Why? Why would I leave Wili?

634
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:30,891
你應該開始為你自己考慮 你應該堅強
You have to start thinking about yourself. You have to be tough.

635
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:33,894
這是生意...在這生意當中
This is a business, and in this business

636
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:37,523
你不可能被一個死人來代表
you can't be represented by a dead woman.

637
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,527
對不起
Excuse me.

638
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:44,238
有空能不能給我打個電話?
Why don't you give me a call?

639
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:49,535
是的 我知道這很困難
Yes, darling, I know it's so inconvenient.

640
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:50,828
把電話本拿來
Get me a copy of the call sheet,

641
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:52,997
告訴弗雷迪我要與他談談
and tell Freddie I wanted to speak to him 10 minutes ago.

642
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:55,499
- 好的 我知道了- 吉婭 親愛的 吻我一下
- Done. I'll take care of it. - Gia, darling, kiss me.

是的 我必須去
Yes I have to go too.

644
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:03,966
- 美好的旅程 - 告訴守點規矩
- Have a wonderful trip. - Tell Christian to behave himself.

645
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:05,509
再見 親愛的
clao darling.

646
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:11,015
- 我已經筋疲力盡了 - 我也是
- I'm exhausted. - Me, too.

647
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:15,936
過來 過來
Come here, come here, come here.

648
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:19,815
我以為你是病了
I thought you were sick.

649
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:23,861
我是病了 親愛的我累極了...
I am sick, darling, sick and tired,

650
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:26,822
但這并不要緊
but it's not serious.

651
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:31,994
- 我也累極了 - 你?
- I'm tired, too. - You?

652
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:33,579
對 是的
Yeah. Yeah.

653
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:38,751
我想我要休息一陣子 你知道我需要時間考慮
I think I wanna stop for a whlle. You know, I need some time to think.

654
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:43,881
可以 但不是現在 親愛的
Yes, but not now, darling.

655
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:48,385
以后會有時間給你休息的
PIenty of time to rest when you're in the ground.

656
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:50,804
現在...
You have...

657
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:53,766
整個世界都在...
the whole world...

658
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:57,102
你的掌握之中
at your fingertips.

659
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:03,275
你一定要挺住抓住機遇
You have to be strong. Seize the moment.

660
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,945
因為如果你不這樣...
Because if you don't,

661
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:10,699
其她姑娘就會等待機會
there's always another girl waiting Right behind you

662
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,743
把你取而代之...
breathing over your shoulder.

663
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:19,833
來吧
Come on.

664
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:24,630
我知道 我知道這很辛苦
I know. I know it's hard.

665
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:26,799
但我們能做到的......
We can do it.

666
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:31,804
我們在一起
You and I together.

667
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:45,275
她看上去真的死了 是嗎?
She really looked dead, didn't she?

668
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,487
死后最令人寬慰的就是沒人關心你看上去怎么樣
The great thing about the afterlife is nobody cares how you look.

669
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:50,114
就象一個普通平常的女孩子
I can hardly wait.

670
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:54,326
太有錢了 太瘦了
Too rich and too thin.

671
00:56:55,495 --> 00:57:00,958
- 想到她會得那病 - 你別傳出去

我相信我們能夠做到

807
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:48,237
超速行駛 還拒捕
These are serious charges. Reckless driving.

808
01:12:48,322 --> 01:12:51,532
- 你知道后果有多嚴重嗎?- 他媽的 這不是我的錯！
- This is reslsting arrest. - God damn it! It's not my fault!

809
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:53,326
也不是我的錯！
It was not my fault either!

810
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:55,370
他正在我的公寓里收拾他的東西！
He was there getting some stuff out of my apartment!

811
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:58,164
當時我跟本就不在那里！我正在來這里的路上！
I wasn't even there! I was on my way back here!

812
01:13:00,125 --> 01:13:02,752
謝天謝地 不然你現在還在監獄里
Thank God, because otherwise, you'd still be in jall.

813
01:13:02,836 --> 01:13:04,420
我要回去工作
I have to go back to work.

814
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:06,464
我知道你要說什么可我需要錢
I know what you're gonna say, but I need the money.

815
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:10,385
別這樣！
Stop it! Stop it.

816
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:13,429
有了錢我才能與你在一起我不能再象現在這樣
I need the money so I can be with you, because I cannot llve like this.

817
01:13:13,514 --> 01:13:16,599
我不能現這樣生活了
I cannot llve like this, okay? I can't llve like this.

818
01:13:18,102 --> 01:13:19,894
我也不能沒有你
And I can't llve without you.

819
01:13:21,313 --> 01:13:23,064
你現在想來拉戈了
You want to come to Largo now?

820
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:27,902
是不是因為別人都不敢與你簽約?
Is that because everyone else is afraid of slgning you?

821
01:13:27,986 --> 01:13:29,904
不 我還沒有與其他人談過
No, I haven't asked anyone else.

822
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:31,864
那為什么先找我?
Then why me?

823
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:34,951
因為你是個貪婪的雜種...
Because you're a greedy fuck

824
01:13:35,035 --> 01:13:37,537
你給我的錢應該比別人要多
and you'll get me more money than anyone else.

825
01:13:38,288 --> 01:13:42,333
這倒是事實
That's the truth.

826
01:13:44,461 --> 01:13:47,505
好吧 實話對你說
So, Let me be truthful with you.

827
01:13:50,342 --> 01:13:55,012
大家都知道毒品的事 你太不小心了
Everyone's aware of the drug problem. You weren't very discreet.

828
01:13:55,931 --> 01:13:57,390
我現在不吸毒了...
Well, I'm clean now,

829
01:13:58,267 --> 01:13:59,725
我想要工作
and I want to work.

830
01:14:07,192 --> 01:14:08,359
讓我看看你的手臂
Let me see your arms.

831
01:14:11,655 --> 01:14:14,449
你要的不是我的手臂你要的是我的臉...
It's not my arms you want. It's my face,

832
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:16,451
還有我的乳房
and my tits.

833
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:18,077
這兩樣都沒事
And they're fine.

834
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:26,002
我們正打算為模特拍電視
We're doing a teIevislon piece on models.

835
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:27,712
我要你也在其中
I want you to be in it.

836
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:32,717
我希望你能比你以前
I want you to look more beautiful

837
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:34,594
任何時候都要漂亮
than you have ever looked.

838
01:14:35,512 --> 01:14:38,306
我要你告訴這個世界...
And I want you to tell the world

839
01:14:39,266 --> 01:14:43,936
以前你受毒品的困擾而現在你已經戒了
that you once had a drug problem and now you don't.

840
01:14:44,021 --> 01:14:46,731
現在你是個好姑娘了
Now you're a good little girl.

841
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:51,944
如果你能做到的話...
If you do that,

842
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:54,572
我們就成交
we have a deaI.

843
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:08,336
好的
Okay.

844
01:15:09,129 --> 01:15:10,213
很好
Good.

845
01:15:15,427 --> 01:15:17,678
- 我做不到 - 你能的
- I can't do this. - Yes, you can.

846
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:19,680
我是個模特 我不能說話
I'm a model. I don't talk.

847
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:22,767
我不應該說話我只要看上去漂亮就行了
I'm not supposed to talk. I'm supposed to just look beautiful.

848
01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:25,228
你是很美
You are beautiful.

849
01:15:26,647 --> 01:15:28,564
那都是你的功勞
You make me beautiful.

850
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:30,441
你好
Hello.

851
01:15:30,734 --> 01:15:32,527
好了嗎
Okay. We're all set.

852
01:15:32,611 --> 01:15:35,363
我們都准備好了 要拍你整個化妝過程...
I'm gonna tape you getting made up. Kind of a before- and- after thing.

853
01:15:35,447 --> 01:15:37,323
- 可以 - 還要提一些問題...
- Great. - We've aIso got some interviews

854
01:15:37,407 --> 01:15:40,159
關于你的朋友 家庭 你母親等等...
set up with your friends, your family, your mother.

855
01:15:40,244 --> 01:15:41,994
我母親也要上電視?
You're gonna put my mother on tape?

856
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:45,623
- 是的 很有可能 - 那樣會更有意思
- Yes, most definitely. - well, that should be interesting.

857
01:15:48,168 --> 01:15:50,461
- 准備好了嗎? - 是的
- You ready? - Yeah.

858
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:52,213
那太好了
Good.

859
01:15:53,465 --> 01:15:56,259
- 我要上一下廁所 - 當然可以
- I just have to go to the bathroom. - Sure.

860
01:15:57,719 --> 01:15:58,970
你們為什么不到那邊去?
Why don't you guys come over here?

861
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:01,639
我也這么想 我思考問題很直接
This is what I want. I want the questions to be short and qulck.

862
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:50,813
你是如何開始接觸模特這一行的?
And how did things first start for you in modeling?

863
01:16:52,357 --> 01:16:56,360
這離不開大家的功勞
I started working with very good people.

864
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:59,780
是他們使我很快成名 你知道嗎?
A Iot of them. Very fast, you know?

865
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:04,243
我并非天生就是一個模特
I didn't bulld into being a model.

866
01:17:04,328 --> 01:17:06,704
我只是有那么一點天份
I just sort of became one.

867
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:09,206
那是如何影響你的?
How has that affected you?

868
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:15,379
當你還很年青的時候你永遠不會知道
When you're young, you don't always know.

869
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:19,508
要區分什么是真的 什么不是真的
It's hard to make out the difference

870
01:17:19,593 --> 01:17:23,220
真的是很難...
between what's real and what is not real.

871
01:17:25,223 --> 01:17:30,394
從某一點來說...你是不是因此染上了毒癮
At one point, you kind of got into the drug scene, didn't you?

872
01:17:34,524 --> 01:17:38,277
是的 你可這么說
Yes, yes, you could say that I did.

873
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:40,905
但你現在不再需要它了 是嗎?
But you're free of it now, aren't you?

874
01:17:41,031 --> 01:17:44,200
當然 我已經完全戒毒了
Yes. DefiniteLy, I'm free of it.

875
01:17:45,243 --> 01:17:48,829
如果我沒戒的話就不可能在這里與你們見面了
I wouldn't be here Right now talking to all of you if I wasn't.

876
01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:50,665
你對自己取得的成就是否感到高興?
Are you happy with your success?

877
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:56,671
你對自己取得的成就是否感到高興?
Are you happy with your success?

878
01:17:56,755 --> 01:17:58,047
我...
I...

879
01:17:59,591 --> 01:18:02,426
是的 是
Yes. Yeah.

880
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:05,054
- 當然 - 你好象不是很確定的樣了?
- l am. - You hesltated.

881
01:18:07,599 --> 01:18:11,852
我只是要好好考慮一下這個問題 是的 我當然很高興
I just wanted to think about it. But, no, I'm definiteLy happy with it.

882
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:14,355
好的 謝謝
Good. Thank you.

883
01:18:14,439 --> 01:18:16,023
好 謝謝
Yeah, thank you.

884
01:18:38,338 --> 01:18:41,298
媽的 媽的怎么回事?
Fuck! What the fuck?

885
01:18:42,467 --> 01:18:45,469
我喜歡踢蜘蛛俠的屁股！
I, like, kick Spider- Man's ass!

886
01:18:51,309 --> 01:18:55,229
對不起別說對不起
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

887
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:02,820
我只是想讓你笑一笑
I just wanted to make you smlie.

888
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:11,245
好了
Okay.

889
01:19:11,621 --> 01:19:14,206
好了 我這就走 最后一次
Okay, I'm going. Last chance.

890
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:19,420
我從前門走
I'm leaving, through the front door.

891
01:19:19,504 --> 01:19:20,963
真受不了你
I can't do this.

892
01:19:21,506 --> 01:19:23,507
別這么說 只要說聲明天見就好了
Don't say that. Just say you'll see me tomorrow.

893
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:26,510
- 不 你明天不會見到我的 - 不要這么說！
- No, you won't. You won't see me tomorrow. - Don't say that!

894
01:19:26,636 --> 01:19:27,845
不要這么說！
Don't say that.

895
01:19:28,722 --> 01:19:31,724
我們說好的 我們有約定的
We had a deaI. We made a bargain.

896
01:19:36,229 --> 01:19:37,563
我愛你不
I Love you.

897
01:19:39,816 --> 01:19:41,192
你并不愛我
No, you don't.

898
01:19:43,195 --> 01:19:46,864
好 我不愛你 不愛你
All Right, I don't. I don't. I don't.

899
01:19:49,242 --> 01:19:52,661
你是什么人啊?是他媽的警察嗎?
What are you, huh? You some kind of fucking pollceman?

900
01:19:52,746 --> 01:19:55,498
你要審判我嗎?我只吸了一點兒
You going to judge me? I did one fucking line.

901
01:19:55,582 --> 01:19:56,999
就一點
One line.

902
01:19:57,709 --> 01:20:00,044
那有什么大不了的?
What is the big deaI?

903
01:20:00,128 --> 01:20:03,214
那昨天吸了沒有呢?前天呢?
What about yesterday? What about the day before?

904
01:20:07,427 --> 01:20:08,719
沒有
Nothing.

905
01:20:09,137 --> 01:20:11,138
我沒吸 我保証
I did nothing. I promise.

906
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:13,224
請不要離開我
Please, don't leave me.

907
01:20:13,308 --> 01:20:15,267
我不相信你了
I don't belive you.

908
01:20:19,272 --> 01:20:21,899
你不信我是因為你不愿意信我 是嗎?
You don't belive me because you don't want to belive me, do you?

909
01:20:21,983 --> 01:20:25,236
因為你不在乎我！因為你只是想說...
Because you don't care! Because you just wanted to say,

910
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:28,364
”我只是一個模特！"
"I'm fucking a model !" Huh? "I'm fucking a model !"

911
01:20:28,448 --> 01:20:29,949
你根本就不關心我 對嗎?
You don't care about me at all, do you?

912
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:33,869
是嗎?告訴我你不在乎我 說 '’我不在乎！' '
Do you? Tell me you don't care! Say, "I don't care! I don't care!"

913
01:20:54,057 --> 01:20:56,767
我很抱歉
Please. I'm sorry.

914
01:20:58,478 --> 01:21:01,564
我是那么需要你 讓我這樣做
I need you so much. Don't make me do this.

915
01:21:04,484 --> 01:21:06,110
我不能讓你做任何事情
I don't make you do anything.

916
01:21:06,653 --> 01:21:08,112
我希望我能夠
I wish I could.

917
01:21:09,781 --> 01:21:14,034
你可以的 你可以的
You could. You could. You could.

918
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,121
你可以照顧我的
You could take care of me.

919
01:21:25,839 --> 01:21:28,632
- 有30美元嗎? - 沒有
- Do you have $30? - No.

920
01:21:32,512 --> 01:21:34,638
我一點錢都沒有
I don't have any money.

921
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:36,724
我不知道為什么 我從來都沒有錢
I don't know why. I never have it.

922
01:21:36,808 --> 01:21:38,767
我從來就沒有過一點錢
I never have any money.

923
01:21:44,482 --> 01:21:45,858
在我的絲襪里
In my sock.

924
01:22:02,292 --> 01:22:04,877
- 你就是為了它什么事都做得出來不 - 不是的
- This is what makes you do everything. - No, it doesn't.

925
01:22:04,961 --> 01:22:08,172
不是我 也不是你 是這玩意兒
Yeah. It's not me. It's not you. It's this.

926
01:22:08,548 --> 01:22:10,215
它控制了你
This shit holds you.

927
01:22:12,302 --> 01:22:15,262
- 你自己選吧 - 別這樣
- You choose. - Come on.

928
01:22:15,347 --> 01:22:25,105
要它還是要我
Yeah, this or me.

929
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:33,572
我要你的手指
Your finger.

930
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:37,660
你的膝蓋
Your knees.

931
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:43,415
你的皮膚
Your skin.

932
01:22:44,542 --> 01:22:45,709
你的腳趾頭
Your toes.

933
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:58,263
我愛你
I Love you.

934
01:24:24,392 --> 01:24:25,392
吉婭
Gia!

935
01:24:48,708 --> 01:24:49,958
她變了
Change.

936
01:25:16,611 --> 01:25:18,362
她的時代過去了
She is over.

937
01:25:20,073 --> 01:25:21,782
現在只是時間問題
It's just a question of time now.

938
01:25:29,541 --> 01:25:31,166
嘿 醒醒
Hey, come on.

939
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:37,589

- Hi. - Yes, you are.

940

You dropped this, honey.

941
01:25:40,677 --> 01:25:43,220
還想繼續來完成這場糟糕的時裝秀嗎?
You want to come on and finish this fiasco?

942
01:25:43,346 --> 01:25:44,346
不
No.

943
01:25:53,731 --> 01:25:55,440
你看上去很漂亮
You look so pretty.

944
01:25:57,318 --> 01:25:58,318
是
Yeah.

945
01:26:01,573 --> 01:26:02,739
謝謝
Thanks.

946
01:26:05,034 --> 01:26:06,326
我愛你
I love you.

947
01:26:08,746 --> 01:26:11,081
我知道你愛所有的人
I know. You love everybody.

948
01:26:18,423 --> 01:26:20,841
吉婭 聽著我很想給你一份工作的
Gia, listen to me. l am trying to get you work.

949
01:26:20,925 --> 01:26:22,843
但現在是春季發布會
But it's all spring stuff now.

950
01:26:23,386 --> 01:26:26,847
大家要看的是美麗健康的人
Everybody wants the bIondes with the suntans and the sundresses.

951
01:26:26,931 --> 01:26:29,975
很抱歉 從你身上看不出一點春天的朝氣
I'm sorry. No, your look is not spring.

952
01:26:30,059 --> 01:26:32,311
你看上去更像是個糟糕的冬天 沒有要看的
Your look is more like nuclear fucking winter, and nobody wants it.

953
01:26:32,395 --> 01:26:33,770
把電話挂了
Hang up the phone.

954
01:26:34,564 --> 01:26:35,939
我好緊張
I am so tense.

955
01:26:36,566 --> 01:26:39,401
羅恩 你能不能他媽的用力點
Ron, can you use some of those fucking muscles?

956
01:26:40,945 --> 01:26:42,613
我好緊張
I'm so tense.

957
01:26:43,615 --> 01:26:48,118
當她吻我的時候我感覺就得春風拂面一樣
"When she kisses me, I feel all four winds bIow at my face.

958
01:26:48,745 --> 01:26:53,207
當她不再愛你時你能怎么做?
"But what do you do with a woman who has no love for you?

959
01:27:00,506 --> 01:27:02,758
她已經對我失去興趣了...
"She is my lost captive

960
01:27:03,468 --> 01:27:06,803
現在也沒有任何謊言‘'
"and no longer lies along my legs."

961
01:27:11,017 --> 01:27:12,476
這是我為你寫的
l wrote that for you.

962
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:59,564
- 為什么他們還讓她露面? - 因為是我要求的
- Why did they send her out? - Because I asked for her.

963
01:27:59,649 --> 01:28:01,358
- 行了吧? - 好的
- All Right? - All Right.

964
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:13,704
當她們沒有利用價值了
We use them up,

965
01:28:15,039 --> 01:28:16,540
就會被扔到一邊...
throw them away.

966
01:28:19,377 --> 01:28:23,046
不
No.

967
01:28:25,466 --> 01:28:29,011
- 我的刀呢? - 我的刀怎么不見了
- Where's my knife? - I haven't seen it.

968
01:28:29,762 --> 01:28:31,763
誰拿了我刀?
Who took my fucking knife?

969
01:28:33,474 --> 01:28:36,101
我看上去是不是象個他媽的恐怖分子?很好笑嗎?
Who do I look like, a fucking terrorist? Is this funny?

970
01:28:36,185 --> 01:28:38,478
- 你們這些混蛋是怎么了? - 吉婭
- What the fuck is wrong with you people? - Gia.

971
01:28:38,563 --> 01:28:40,564
離我遠點！
Get the fuck away from me!

972
01:28:40,898 --> 01:28:43,900
滾！我的刀呢?
Get away! Where's my knife?

973
01:28:46,404 --> 01:28:49,364
在這兒
Here it is. Here it is.

974
01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:55,162
你知道 你不能這么做
You know, you can't do that.

975
01:28:55,246 --> 01:28:57,414
當別人需要刀子的時候 你不能把它拿走！
You can't take somebody's knife when they need it!

976
01:28:57,498 --> 01:28:59,916
你說得對 好了
It's all Right. It's fine.

977
01:29:01,419 --> 01:29:04,379
- 看看她手臂的疤痕 - 現在好了
- Look at the tracks on her arms. - Okay, now.

978
01:29:04,464 --> 01:29:06,006
還有她手里的那把東西
And that awful thing on her hand.

979
01:29:06,758 --> 01:29:08,925
- 真是可怕 - 好了
- It looks like a voIcano. - All Right.

980
01:29:12,138 --> 01:29:14,139
把你的手臂疊起來
Try... Try folding your arms.

981
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:20,604
我是說放在你背后
Put them in back of you.

982
01:29:21,731 --> 01:29:23,690
很好 做得不錯
Well, you've almost got it.

983
01:29:23,775 --> 01:29:25,609
現在 把手放在臀部下面
Now, try sltting on your hands.

984
01:29:28,529 --> 01:29:30,197
對 就這樣
Yes, yes.

985
01:29:32,116 --> 01:29:33,784
你看上好極了
You look wonderful.

986
01:29:35,703 --> 01:29:37,329
很美
Beautiful.

987
01:29:50,927 --> 01:29:53,720
- 弗朗西斯科? - 什么事 甜心?
- Francesco? - Yes, sweetheart?

988
01:29:54,972 --> 01:29:56,223
謝謝
Thank you.

989
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:03,855
吉婭 這就是生活 不是天堂
Gia, this is life, not heaven.

990
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:05,690
你不用強求事事完美
You don't have to be perfect.

991
01:30:08,069 --> 01:30:11,738
看著我 眼睛在哪里? 嘴巴在那里?
Look at me. Where are those eyes? Where's the mouth?

992
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:14,449
什么?你不會吧！
What? You're not!

993
01:30:15,535 --> 01:30:17,285
真的?你在飛機上?
TruLy? You're on an airplane?

994
01:30:17,370 --> 01:30:19,955
- 是 - 噢 天哪 聽我說
- Yeah. - Oh, my God ! Listen to me!

995
01:30:20,039 --> 01:30:22,249
我真是太興奮了 太高興了！
I'm so exclted ! I'm yelling !

996
01:30:22,333 --> 01:30:24,334
我高興得要叫出聲了
I don't have to yell, do I?

997
01:30:24,710 --> 01:30:27,337
- 你不用那樣啊 - 亨利
- No, you don't have to yell. - Henry!

998
01:30:27,547 --> 01:30:30,966
- 媽媽 不要與亨利說話 - 他到哪兒去了?別挂
- Mom, I don't want to talk to Henry. - Where is he? Hold on.

999
01:30:31,426 --> 01:30:36,346
你在哪兒?我是說 飛機在哪兒了?
Henry. Where are you? Where are you? I mean, where is the airplane?

1000
01:30:36,514 --> 01:30:39,015
我以前從未跟在飛機上的人打過電話
I've never talked to anybody on an airplane before.

1001
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:44,938
過了巴黎... 我想現在快到莫尼黑了
I was in Paris and I think I'm going to Munich.

1002
01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:47,899
我不知道
I don't know.

1003
01:30:49,944 --> 01:30:51,528
我感覺不是很好
I don't feel so good.

1004
01:30:52,738 --> 01:30:55,991
寶貝 你一定是累了?
Well, honey, you're probabLy just tired, you know?

1005
01:30:56,951 --> 01:30:59,953
是的...我還有點冷
Yeah, and I'm cold.

1006
01:31:03,207 --> 01:31:04,541
你知道...
You know,

1007
01:31:06,711 --> 01:31:10,881
我正在想是否要回到家里住 你說呢?
I was thinking about coming home again. What do you think?

1008
01:31:16,888 --> 01:31:19,431
寶貝 我覺得這樣不太好
Honey, I don't think so.

1009
01:31:20,558 --> 01:31:21,766
你知道?
You know?

1010
01:31:26,481 --> 01:31:31,067
- 對 - 我是說 自從你上次離開
- Yeah. - I mean, you know, after the last time.

1011
01:31:32,236 --> 01:31:33,987
是 我知道 當然
Yeah, I know. Of course.

1012
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:47,584
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1013
01:31:51,797 --> 01:31:53,048
沒什么
Yeah.

1014
01:31:58,721 --> 01:31:59,846
我還是回家吧
I better go.

1015
01:32:01,057 --> 01:32:03,266
好了 好了
All Right. Okay. All Right.

1016
01:32:03,434 --> 01:32:07,604
聽我說 你要好好照顧好你自己
Listen to me. Now, you take care of yourself.

1017
01:32:07,688 --> 01:32:10,857
好嗎?給我打電話
Okay? Okay. You call me.

1018
01:32:10,942 --> 01:32:13,860
- 好 - 好嗎?我愛你
- Okay. - Okay? Because I love you.

1019
01:32:14,278 --> 01:32:17,781
- 再見 - 再見
- Bye. - Bye- bye. Bye- bye.

1020
01:33:18,801 --> 01:33:20,844
每個模特都會有光輝的一刻
Every model has a moment,

1021
01:33:21,971 --> 01:33:23,597
我是指那個模特...
I mean, the ones who make it at all,

1022
01:33:23,681 --> 01:33:25,849
但否將那一刻留芳于世
and whether or not they can parlay that moment

1023
01:33:25,933 --> 01:33:31,062
就看運氣了...這就是在賭博 不是嗎?
into some kind of a career, well, that's the gamble, isn't it?

1024
01:33:31,897 --> 01:33:34,149
因為那一刻是那么地短暫
'Cause the moment is a very short time.

1025
01:33:34,233 --> 01:33:36,776
它轉瞬即逝就好象這些女孩
It's here and then it's gone, just like most of these girls.

1026
01:33:37,278 --> 01:33:39,988
她們就在這兒...但很快就不見了
They're here and then they're gone.

1027
01:33:44,535 --> 01:33:48,622
當她回到紐約時...我正在費城
when she came back to New York, I was in Philadelphia.

1028
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:51,791
我聽說了一些事情
And l heard some things.

1029
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:53,335
很多事情
A lot of things.

1030
01:33:54,545 --> 01:33:56,796
我就坐火車去看她
So l took the train up to see her.

1031
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:20,737
我的錢不見了
I can't find my money.

1032
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:25,367
- 什么? - 我有600美元的 可我找不到了
- What? - I had $600, and I can't find it.

1033
01:34:35,586 --> 01:34:36,878
發生什么事了?
What's going on?

1034
01:34:37,338 --> 01:34:39,339
我的錢不見了！
I can't find my money!

1035
01:34:40,633 --> 01:34:42,050
你這是怎么了?
What's wrong with you?

1036
01:34:43,511 --> 01:34:45,011
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

1037
01:34:45,846 --> 01:34:49,182
- 你有錢嗎? - 不 我沒錢
- Do you have any money? - No, I don't have any money.

1038
01:34:51,102 --> 01:34:52,435
想跟我做愛嗎?
You want to fuck me?

1039
01:34:52,978 --> 01:34:53,978
吉婭
Gia.

1040
01:34:55,564 --> 01:34:57,273
你給我錢 我就讓你干
You give me money, I'll let you fuck me.

1041
01:35:00,277 --> 01:35:02,946
- 到我這里來 - 什么?
- Come here. - What?

1042
01:35:03,406 --> 01:35:04,406
不
No.

1043
01:35:05,408 --> 01:35:08,993
你做什么?
No, get off! What? No.

1044
01:35:10,287 --> 01:35:13,456
- 我可以抱著你嗎? - 放開我！
- Can I please hold you? - Get off! Get off!

1045
01:35:13,541 --> 01:35:15,583
- 別再吸毒了 - 走開
- No drugs. - Get off!

1046
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:17,794
放開我！
Get off of me!

1047
01:35:18,254 --> 01:35:19,963
- 冷靜點 - 好
- CaIm down. - Okay.

1048
01:35:20,047 --> 01:35:21,047
好
Okay.

1049
01:35:39,316 --> 01:35:42,777
- 你有醫療保險嗎? - 沒有
- Okay, do you have any medicaI insurance? - No.

1050
01:35:43,654 --> 01:35:47,407
- 那你要付現金? - 不 我沒錢
- Can you pay cash for this? - No, I don't have any money.

1051
01:35:50,619 --> 01:35:52,162
愚蠢的問題
Stupid question.

1052
01:35:54,540 --> 01:35:57,208
那好 你必須申請破產
All Right. You'll have to declare yourself indigent.

1053
01:35:57,293 --> 01:35:58,835
你明白嗎?
Do you understand that?

1054
01:36:39,794 --> 01:36:41,044
等一下
wait a minute.

1055
01:36:41,545 --> 01:36:45,256
要我因為你長得漂亮因為你無所事事就同情你?
what, am I supposed to feel sorry for you because you're beautiful?

1056
01:36:46,175 --> 01:36:49,928
因為你每分鐘賺一萬塊而無所事事?
Because you made 10,000 a minute doing fucking nothing?

1057
01:36:51,514 --> 01:36:56,392
這不可能 沒人能夠這樣要求我
"It was so hard, so terrible. They treated me so bad."

1058
01:36:56,727 --> 01:37:01,397
聽著 你本來生活得不錯...但你不要了
Listen, girl. You had a free ride and you fucking blew it.

1059
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:09,489
而我...
And me?

1060
01:37:09,907 --> 01:37:12,367
我來自俄亥俄...
I'm some kid from Ohio,

1061
01:37:12,451 --> 01:37:16,246
讀著時尚雜志 看著你的照片 心里想...
reading fashion magazines, looking at your picture and thinking,

1062
01:37:16,997 --> 01:37:19,123
如果我是那樣的話...
"I'm supposed to look like that,"

1063
01:37:19,917 --> 01:37:23,169
我會瘋了的因為我不
and going fucking crazy because I don't.

1064
01:37:23,879 --> 01:37:26,714
因為沒人對我說那是假的
Because nobody told me it was a lle.

1065
01:37:26,799 --> 01:37:31,386
因為雜志上沒有注明...
Because the magazine doesn't come with a label that says,

1066
01:37:31,470 --> 01:37:35,431
注意 這是假的沒人會是那樣的
"Caution. This is a lle. Nobody looks like this."

1067
01:37:35,516 --> 01:37:37,183
即使是你
Not even you.

1068
01:37:46,277 --> 01:37:51,155
他們叫我去我就去了 我也努力過
well, they asked me to go to the sesslons, so I did. l trled.

1069
01:37:52,241 --> 01:37:55,451
我真是瘋了 我瘋了
I just got so mad. I got so mad.

1070
01:37:56,996 --> 01:38:00,415
我對他們說 看 我不是吸毒的
I said to them, "Look, I'm not the drug addict here.

1071
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:03,877
我不是那種隨便讓你們支來支去的人我說 都過去了 就讓它過去了吧
"I'm not the one that you should be rlpping apart."

1072
01:38:05,629 --> 01:38:10,884
為什么你就不能讓它算了呢?
I said, "This is all burled. Why don't you just let it be?"

1073
01:38:10,968 --> 01:38:13,595
這就是我對他們說的
That's what I told 'em. Look, I know. I know.

1074
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:16,055
你們想怪罪別人你們想怪罪我
You want to blame somebody. You want to blame me.

1075
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:18,349
好吧 來吧
Okay, go ahead. Knock yourself out.

1076
01:38:19,727 --> 01:38:24,480
但你們要記住： 我做過的每一件事我所做的一切都是因為我愛她
But just remember this, everything I did, I did because I loved her.

1077
01:38:25,524 --> 01:38:29,819
我相信那就是我的愛...我也祈禱她能得到那份愛
And I belive that it was my love and my prayers that got her through that.

1078
01:38:43,250 --> 01:38:45,126
嗨 琳達 我是吉婭
Hi, Linda, it's Gia.

1079
01:38:45,711 --> 01:38:47,420
我是來向你道歉的
I'm calling to apologize.

1080
01:38:49,089 --> 01:38:51,507
我正在治療中...
I'm in this program

1081
01:38:51,592 --> 01:38:55,053
治療的一部分就是...
and it's, like, part of the program that we're supposed to

1082
01:38:55,137 --> 01:38:58,723
希望得到那些在我們吸毒時傷害過的人的原諒
ask forgiveness of the people that we hurt when we were drugging.

1083
01:38:59,391 --> 01:39:03,394
我就像“和男人干 可以休息一下”
I was like "Well fuck man. That could take the rest of my life."

1084
01:39:07,524 --> 01:39:10,193
對不起 這很愚蠢
I'm sorry. This is stupid.

1085
01:39:16,033 --> 01:39:19,786
但無論如何 我還是希望得到你的諒解...
Anyway, I'm calling to ask forgiveness

1086
01:39:19,870 --> 01:39:23,247
并且要說 我想你 因為
and to say that I miss you, because...

1087
01:39:23,457 --> 01:39:24,457
喂?
Hello?

1088
01:39:25,709 --> 01:39:28,294
怎么回事?
what is that? Am l done?

1089
01:39:28,379 --> 01:39:30,630
我想我說完了我不知道發生了什么事
l think I'm done. l don't know what happened.

1090
01:39:30,714 --> 01:39:33,049
喂 是我
Hi. Hi, it's me.

1091
01:39:41,266 --> 01:39:42,558
男孩琳達
Boy, Linda.

1092
01:39:44,687 --> 01:39:45,895
是的
Yeah.

1093
01:39:46,522 --> 01:39:47,522
嗨
Hi.

1094
01:39:53,821 --> 01:39:56,280
這下我不知道該說什么了
Well, now I don't know what to say.

1095
01:39:58,075 --> 01:40:01,995
沒事 我在聽我一直在聽著
It's okay. I heard you. I heard it all.

1096
01:40:03,372 --> 01:40:04,831
真的沒事嗎?
Is that okay?

1097
01:40:06,750 --> 01:40:07,875
是的
Yeah.

1098
01:40:19,013 --> 01:40:24,684
我不能說了 我要走了 過几天再打電話給你行嗎?
I can't talk Right now. I have to go. Can I call you in a few days?

1099
01:40:27,896 --> 01:40:30,606
這几天我要出去 回來后給你打電話好嗎?
I'm gonna be out in a few days, and then I'm gonna call you, okay?

1100
01:40:30,941 --> 01:40:34,944
好的
Okay.

1101
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:04,557
看了這個你就知道她為何總說自己是個模特了
You know how she's always saying she's a model?

1102
01:41:04,641 --> 01:41:06,893
哦 天啊
Oh, my sweet Jesus!

1103
01:41:06,977 --> 01:41:08,311
這就是她?
Is that her?

1104
01:41:09,772 --> 01:41:13,816
很難想象她會在這里疊牛仔服...
God, she's been folding the same pair of jeans for the last five minutes.

1105
01:41:17,154 --> 01:41:21,407
還有一件事 你不會想在那地方做事
And that's another thing. You don't want to work in a place like that, Gia.

1106
01:41:22,034 --> 01:41:25,745
討厭的地方討厭的人
UgLy, ugLy place. UgLy people.

1107
01:41:25,829 --> 01:41:28,498
媽媽 那地方不錯
Mom, listen. This is the good part.

1108
01:41:28,999 --> 01:41:30,124
很好
This is good.

1109
01:41:30,584 --> 01:41:34,045
一切真的開始好轉了嗎?
Everything's gonna be really good from now on, okay?

1110
01:41:36,882 --> 01:41:37,882
好的
Okay.

1111
01:41:41,470 --> 01:41:43,638
看看看看你的皮膚
Look at this. Look at your skin.

1112
01:41:44,473 --> 01:41:45,640
媽媽
Mom.

1113
01:41:46,183 --> 01:41:50,103
什么?那只個小瘡疤 沒事的
What? It's just acne. It's okay. It'll go away.

1114
01:41:50,187 --> 01:41:53,106
只是我體內的毒素被逼出來了而已
It's the drugs. They're coming out of my system.

1115
01:41:53,190 --> 01:41:55,316
很快就會好的
I'm gonna look really good.

1116
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:57,443
到了聖誕節我一定會很漂亮的
And by Christmas, I'm gonna look great.

1117
01:41:57,945 --> 01:42:00,863
我們將會過一個愉快的節日
And we are gonna have the best hoilday ever.

1118
01:42:02,032 --> 01:42:03,908
你為什么不到家里來
Why don't you come home, huh?

1119
01:42:04,284 --> 01:42:06,744
跟我一起回去好嗎?
Move back in with me. Would you like that?

1120
01:42:11,166 --> 01:42:12,166
不
No,

1121
01:42:13,836 --> 01:42:15,837
我想一個人
I gotta be alone.

1122
01:42:17,548 --> 01:42:21,384
能不能借我點錢買咖啡和牙膏?
But can you Iend me a few bucks for coffee and toothpaste?

1123
01:42:21,468 --> 01:42:23,136
哦 說到咖啡！
The coffee!

1124
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:25,888
不好意思 我忘了
I'm sorry. I forgot.

1125
01:42:26,849 --> 01:42:31,144
你以前賺的錢本該足夠過你的余生的
You know, with the money you made, you could have llved the rest of your life.

1126
01:42:32,229 --> 01:42:34,438
好了 這只是我的建議
Well, that's what happens, I suppose.

1127
01:42:38,068 --> 01:42:40,653
- 怎么了? - 我覺得有點頭暈
- What? - I'm just feeling dizzy.

1128
01:42:40,821 --> 01:42:42,238
- 怎么了? - 媽媽
- What is it? - Mom.

1129
01:42:43,115 --> 01:42:44,323
吉婭
Gia.

1130
01:42:46,326 --> 01:42:49,412
你發燒了
Honey... Honey, you're burning up.

1131
01:42:50,873 --> 01:42:53,875
- 我覺得耳朵不舒服 - 我的孩子
- Why do my ears hurt? - Baby.

1132
01:42:56,587 --> 01:42:59,589
不不不 哦 天啊
No, no, no, no, no. Oh, my God.

1133
01:43:09,933 --> 01:43:12,643
你得了肺炎...這個我們可以醫治好
You have pneumonia, which we can treat.

1134
01:43:14,897 --> 01:43:16,522
吉婭 聽著
Gia, listen.

1135
01:43:17,691 --> 01:43:21,903
但更為嚴重的是使你感染肺炎的原因
There's something more serious going on which caused your infection.

1136
01:43:22,988 --> 01:43:27,116
那就是愛滋病
Something they're calling Acqulred Immune Deficlency Syndrome.

1137
01:43:28,202 --> 01:43:31,370
- 你也說聽過說吧? - 沒有
- Maybe you heard about it? - No.

1138
01:43:32,789 --> 01:43:34,165
我怎么會得那種病的?
How did I get it?

1139
01:43:34,708 --> 01:43:39,086
我們剛剛查出來...而你是我遇到的第一個得這種病的女人
Well, we're really just finding things out and you're the first woman I've known about.

1140
01:43:39,171 --> 01:43:43,216
通過靜脈注射吸毒的人得這種病機率很高
AIthough, intravenous drug users seem to be an especlally high- risk group.

1141
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:46,093
你可能是由于使用了受污染的注射器引起的
So you probabLy got it from a contaminated needIe.

1142
01:43:47,638 --> 01:43:49,639
怎么才能治好?
How do I get rld of it?

1143
01:44:11,036 --> 01:44:12,995
他們怎么知道?他們對這種病也是一無所知
But how do they know? They don't know anything about it.

1144
01:44:13,330 --> 01:44:17,291
他們知道的 但沒法治療
They know, okay? They just know.

1145
01:45:15,225 --> 01:45:17,643
你知道我在想什么嗎?
You know what I think?

1146
01:45:17,728 --> 01:45:20,104
我想每件事情都有它發生的理由
I think there's a reason for everything.

1147
01:45:21,398 --> 01:45:25,109
我想上天對每個人都有一個安排
And I think that there's a plan for everybody.

1148
01:45:26,737 --> 01:45:32,408
我想上帝已經為我做了最好的打算...
And I think that God has a big plan for me.

1149
01:45:33,827 --> 01:45:36,162
只是不是在我活著的時候
Just not in this life.

1150
01:45:39,583 --> 01:45:43,711
我在萬物之上
I'm on top of everything. I'm super cool.

1151
01:45:46,631 --> 01:45:48,257
你現在看上去好多了
You've gotten better.

1152
01:45:54,514 --> 01:45:56,057
我不能帶他回家
I can't take her home.

1153
01:45:57,225 --> 01:46:00,269
我想 但是亨利怕
I'm trying, but Henry, he's just afraid.

1154
01:46:01,063 --> 01:46:02,480
什么?
So what?

1155
01:46:03,190 --> 01:46:04,565
布萊爾醫生...
Dr. Blair...

1156
01:46:04,900 --> 01:46:07,735
她是你的女兒 你的女兒
This is your daughter. Your daughter.

1157
01:46:07,819 --> 01:46:10,821
大家都很害怕我也很怕
So people are scared. I am scared.

1158
01:46:10,906 --> 01:46:14,116
他怕這事被人知道了他可能會丟了工作
He's afraid that if people find out, he could lose his job.

1159
01:46:17,871 --> 01:46:21,332
好 很好
Fine. Okay, fine. Fine.

1160
01:46:23,293 --> 01:46:25,419
那她該上哪兒去?
And where is she going to go?

1161
01:46:25,504 --> 01:46:29,548
他要她去住旅館他說錢由他出
He wants her to go to a hoteI. He says that he'll pay for it.

1162
01:46:31,635 --> 01:46:33,386
天阿 聽我說
Oh, God, listen to me.

1163
01:46:35,639 --> 01:46:36,972
聽我說
Listen to me.

1164
01:46:40,435 --> 01:46:44,397
布魯斯醫生 有電話找
Dr. Bruce, telephone, please. Dr. Bruce, telephone, please.

1165
01:46:55,158 --> 01:46:57,576
她的父親呢?他不能照顧她嗎?
What about her father? Why can't he take her? Can he take her?

1166
01:46:57,661 --> 01:46:59,453
她不想讓他知道
She doesn't want him to know.

1167
01:47:02,833 --> 01:47:05,334
我也不想失去我的孩子
I don't want to lose my baby.

1168
01:47:10,424 --> 01:47:13,884
- 凱西里恩 - 不 不行
- Kathleen. - No, I can't. I can't.

1169
01:47:24,855 --> 01:47:28,607
好吧...你要明白
well, you have to understand.

1170
01:47:28,692 --> 01:47:30,651
在那些日子里...
ln those days,

1171
01:47:32,529 --> 01:47:34,196
沒有人知道
nobody knew.

1172
01:47:41,872 --> 01:47:45,875
大家都很害怕 我也是
People were scared. I was scared.

1173
01:47:48,670 --> 01:47:51,213
她自己也一定怕極了
She must have been scared, too.

1174
01:48:04,811 --> 01:48:08,647
親愛的琳達 這是我的書的最后一部分
Dear Linda, this is the end of my book.

1175
01:48:08,732 --> 01:48:11,942
最后一張 最后一頁
The last page, the last shot.

1176
01:48:12,027 --> 01:48:14,695
看到你對我說你好 再見
Seeing you to say hello and goodbye.

1177
01:48:15,572 --> 01:48:20,826
看到你填補所有的空白...你的昧道 你的觸摸...
Seeing you to fill up all the empty, and smell and touch,

1178
01:48:21,036 --> 01:48:23,245
把我的吻都留在你的臉上
and leave my kisses all over your face.

1179
01:48:26,917 --> 01:48:29,627
- 吉婭 - 是我
- Gia. - That's me.

1180
01:48:30,545 --> 01:48:33,088
進來吧
Come in. Come in.

1181
01:48:37,802 --> 01:48:39,762
來點茶嗎?
Do you want some tea?

1182
01:48:40,639 --> 01:48:45,226
看到你我好緊張 咖啡?
I was so nervous about seeing you. Coffee?

1183
01:48:46,269 --> 01:48:48,395
不 我馬上就走
No, I can't stay Iong.

1184
01:48:49,481 --> 01:48:50,689
為什么?
Why not?

1185
01:48:54,778 --> 01:48:56,070
我有個約會
I have an appointment.

1186
01:48:57,822 --> 01:48:58,989
工作?
Work?

1187
01:48:59,574 --> 01:49:02,284
我再也不用工作了
No. No. No more work for me.

1188
01:49:04,162 --> 01:49:06,872
我想我們會有更多時間在一起
I just thought we'd have more time.

1189
01:49:06,957 --> 01:49:08,499
我也是這么想的
Yeah, me, too.

1190
01:49:09,125 --> 01:49:10,459
只是不是今天
Just not today.

1191
01:49:10,794 --> 01:49:12,044
好吧
That's okay.

1192
01:49:12,629 --> 01:49:16,257
我們會擁有全世界的時間
We have all the time in the world. We'll take it.

1193
01:49:17,467 --> 01:49:19,134
我也這么認為
Yeah, I guess so.

1194
01:49:21,137 --> 01:49:24,139
但今天我只想看看你的臉
But today I just wanted to see your face.

1195
01:49:24,516 --> 01:49:25,808
我很想念你的面容
I missed your face.

1196
01:49:40,156 --> 01:49:42,157
你有什么打算?
What are you going to do?

1197
01:49:45,328 --> 01:49:47,997
我不知道 我想...
I don't know. I have some plans.

1198
01:49:48,123 --> 01:49:52,710
我可能去讀書 去學些有用的東西
I think I might go to schooI, you know? Learn something useful maybe.

1199
01:49:54,504 --> 01:49:57,881
或許安頓下來 要几個孩子 天知道
Maybe even settIe down and have some kids, you know?

1200
01:49:57,966 --> 01:49:59,592
這真是...
What the hell?

1201
01:49:59,843 --> 01:50:01,302
喔
Wow.

1202
01:50:02,178 --> 01:50:04,179
你現在好坦誠啊
How straight are you now?

1203
01:50:04,598 --> 01:50:07,725
我是說 你指的是男人嗎?
I mean, are we talking about men?

1204
01:50:08,935 --> 01:50:10,936
并不是要有丈夫才能有孩子的
You don't need a husband to have kids.

1205
01:50:14,691 --> 01:50:18,360
我說 我的心里只有你一個 你知道嗎?
And besides, you were the one who always had my heart, you know?

是的 這點我想我知道
Yeah, I guess I did know that.

1207
01:50:33,543 --> 01:50:35,711
你能為我保存這些東西嗎?
Would you keep these for me?

1208
01:50:38,214 --> 01:50:42,384
- 你的童話故事? - 是的 有一些
- Your fairy tales? - Yeah, some. A few.

1209
01:50:43,553 --> 01:50:46,597
還有其它一些我自己的涂鴉
Plus all the other crazy shit in my head.

1210
01:50:48,224 --> 01:50:52,478
我不想把它們扔了
I don't want to throw it away, but I just don't want it around Right now.

1211
01:50:53,897 --> 01:50:56,982
- 你想看就看看吧 - 不 我不看
- You can read it if you want. - No, I won't.

1212
01:50:57,150 --> 01:51:01,153

No, read it. Read it. I want you to, you know?

1213
01:51:01,237 --> 01:51:05,115
許可以看出些什么而我從來沒看出來
Maybe you can make some sense out of it. I never could.

1214
01:51:07,077 --> 01:51:09,495
- 好的 - 好

1217
01:51:25,261 --> 01:51:30,099
你知道 我一直在想...
You know, I was thinking about

1218
01:51:31,267 --> 01:51:34,353
這個夏天到海邊買棟房子
getting a house at the beach this summer.

1219
01:51:34,437 --> 01:51:35,854
- 是嗎? - 是的
- Yeah? - Yeah.

1220
01:51:35,939 --> 01:51:39,566
我很希望我們可以從那兒開始重新來過
I really thought that it would give us a chance.

1221
01:51:41,111 --> 01:51:44,780
我真的非常希望我們能夠重新來過
I would like so much for us to have another chance.

1222

是啊 我也是
Yeah, I'd like that, too.

1223
01:51:55,166 --> 01:51:56,166
我要走了
I gotta go.

1224
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:59,795
- 不 等等我要你留下來 - 好
- No, wait. I want you to stay. - Yeah.

1225
01:52:04,759 --> 01:52:05,759
嘿
Hey.

1226
01:52:12,642 --> 01:52:15,978
你是我的唯一 我的唯一
You were the one. You were the only one.

1227
01:52:17,480 --> 01:52:19,314
你是我的奇跡
And you are amazing.

1228
01:52:34,330 --> 01:52:35,873
她...
She...

1229
01:52:36,374 --> 01:52:38,667
她把錢收集起來
She put together this money.

1230
01:52:40,128 --> 01:52:44,798
她當了一些東西... 向父親借了一些...
She pawned some things, borrowed some from her father,

1231
01:52:45,425 --> 01:52:48,218
從凱西里恩那里偷7點
stole some from Kathleen.

1232
01:52:51,514 --> 01:52:55,684
當時我不知道
I didn't know what she was doing.

1233
01:52:56,102 --> 01:52:59,438
我本該知道的...可我不知道
l should have, but I didn't.

1234
01:52:59,522 --> 01:53:02,566
可能是思維定式
It may have crossed my mind.

1235
01:53:04,110 --> 01:53:05,903
我真的沒想到她會那樣做
l really didn't think she would do that.

1236
01:53:08,698 --> 01:53:10,574
真的沒想到
I really didn't.

1237
01:53:13,745 --> 01:53:16,413

1241
01:53:33,723 --> 01:53:36,517
你要那么多用來做什么?
What are you gonna do with that much stuff?

1242
01:53:38,144 --> 01:53:40,145
那是我自己的事
Well, that's my business.

1243
01:53:45,318 --> 01:53:48,487
- 你到底有還是沒有? - 你急什么?
- What, are you holding or not? - What's your hurry?

1244
01:53:49,447 --> 01:53:51,281
好了 說吧 有還是沒有?
All Right. Come on. Yes, or no?

1245
01:53:52,659 --> 01:53:57,496
是的 我有你想要的...這就是你想要的
Yeah, I got what you need, and I got it Right here.

1246
01:53:58,414 --> 01:54:00,582
你他媽的做什么啊?
Yo, man, what the fuck are you doing, man?

1247
01:54:00,667 --> 01:54:03,877
- 看看聖誕老人給我們帶什么來了? - 我他媽的走了
- Look what Santa claus brought us. - I'm freaking out of here!

1248
01:54:03,962 --> 01:54:06,421
你拿錢我也有份
You get the money. I'm gonna get mine.

1249
01:54:26,609 --> 01:54:28,443
一切都會好起來的
It's gonna be all right.

1250
01:54:48,172 --> 01:54:50,257
凱西里恩
Kathleen 

1251
01:54:51,301 --> 01:54:53,302
你來這里做什么?
what are you doing here?

1252
01:55:10,445 --> 01:55:13,322
我要帶你回家 孩子
I'm gonna take you home, baby.

1253
01:55:19,287 --> 01:55:23,749
她不想見任何人...但我還是去了
She wouldn't let anybody see her, but l went anyway.

1254
01:55:24,500 --> 01:55:26,835
我只見了她一面
l saw her once.

1255
01:55:27,962 --> 01:55:29,546
但我確實見到了
But I did see her.

1256
01:55:30,006 --> 01:55:34,009
- 我想她沒認出我來 - 不要超過5分鐘
- l don't think she knew it was me. - No more than five minutes, okay?

1257
01:55:35,595 --> 01:55:40,140
我忍不住對自己說天啊 她還只是個孩子
I couldn't help thinking to myself, "My God, she's just a kid."

1258
01:55:41,225 --> 01:55:43,685
我很自責 你知道嗎?
I blame myself, you know?

1259
01:55:44,938 --> 01:55:47,940
這只是孩子
I mean, these are chlldren.

1260
01:55:49,359 --> 01:55:55,238
無論我們的生活多么艱難... 我們都應該照顧好我們的孩子
No matter how screwed up our llves may be we've got to take care of our chlldren.

1261
01:56:08,753 --> 01:56:10,587
她自己知道命不長了
She knew she was dying.

1262
01:56:11,047 --> 01:56:13,632
她說她要做件事
She said she wanted to do it Right.

1263
01:56:13,716 --> 01:56:16,301
她要一架攝影機...
She wanted to get a video camera

1264
01:56:16,970 --> 01:56:21,098
她要告訴孩子們關于毒品的事
and do this thing where she talked to kids about drugs.

1265
01:56:22,433 --> 01:56:24,559
她想告訴孩子們...
She wanted to tell kids

1266
01:56:25,478 --> 01:56:27,771
無論遇到什么誘惑
that you can handle it.

1267
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:31,817
都不要輕易上勾
You can handle anything that comes your way.

1268
01:56:34,404 --> 01:56:36,738
但我們沒有拍
But we never got the camera.

1269
01:56:47,125 --> 01:56:51,420
你是最漂亮最漂亮的女孩
You do be the prettiest, prettiest girl.

1270
01:56:52,630 --> 01:56:54,589
你是的

1271
01:56:55,425 --> 01:56:57,092
真的嗎?
Do I?

1272
01:56:57,927 --> 01:57:01,471
我真的是最漂亮的嗎?
Do I be the prettiest?

1273
01:57:02,473 --> 01:57:03,473
是
Yeah.

1274
01:57:04,684 --> 01:57:05,684
不
No.

1275
01:57:17,321 --> 01:57:19,531
你能原諒我嗎凱西里恩 ?
Do you forgive me, Kathleen?

1276
01:57:23,244 --> 01:57:24,870
哦 親愛的
Oh, honey.

1277
01:57:26,831 --> 01:57:31,251

1278
01:57:33,588 --> 01:57:35,213
當然

01:57:41,137 --> 01:57:43,638
因為我也原諒了你
Because I forgive you, too.

1280
01:57:48,144 --> 01:57:49,770
親愛的
Baby.

1281
01:58:00,156 --> 01:58:01,323
這是什么?
What's this?

1282
01:58:07,497 --> 01:58:08,747
這是什么?
What is it?

1283
01:58:09,415 --> 01:58:10,665
天啊
Oh, my God.

1284
01:58:14,212 --> 01:58:15,921
護士?護士
Nurse? Nurse!

1285
01:58:16,339 --> 01:58:18,465
- 你去哪兒?媽媽? - 護士?
- Where are you going, Mom? - Nurse!

1286
01:58:19,842 --> 01:58:21,510
媽媽?
Mom?

1287
01:58:22,637 --> 01:58:24,596
你去哪兒?
Where you going?

1288
01:58:31,354 --> 01:58:33,772
她大概是在早上1 0 : 00去世的
She died around 1 0:00 in the morning.

1289
01:58:34,482 --> 01:58:36,191
他們試圖把她...
They trled to pick her...

1290
01:58:37,068 --> 01:58:39,569
他們試圖把她救活 可她
They trled to pick her up off the bed, and she...

1291
01:58:40,196 --> 01:58:42,989
她就這樣離我們而去了
The flesh just fell off her back. It just fell off.

1292
01:58:44,075 --> 01:58:46,034
你不會想聽這些的
You don't want to hear about that.

1293
01:58:48,496 --> 01:58:50,956
還有什么?
Okay, what else? What else?

1294
01:58:58,673 --> 01:59:02,759
就是這個這個就是我要找的
Yeah, this is it. This is what I was looking for.

1295
01:59:04,428 --> 01:59:09,975
村里的人說 她不再美麗了
"And the people said, 'Oh, she's not beautiful at all.'

1296
01:59:10,059 --> 01:59:14,479
他們把她趕出了那所漂亮的房子...把她扔到了大街上
"And they took her from the beautiful house and they drove her into the street.

1297
01:59:15,398 --> 01:59:19,776
她走了...再也不回去了
"And she went away and she never came back.

1298
01:59:23,489 --> 01:59:28,660
不久 人們又貪婪了...他們回到那所漂亮的房子...
"And soon, people became hungry again and they went back into the beautiful house

1299
01:59:28,744 --> 01:59:32,455
尋找金子可那里再也沒有金子了
"looking for gold, but there was no one there."

1300
01:59:34,542 --> 01:59:38,962
他們說她知道 她的確知道她知道所有的事
They say she knew. She really knew. She knew the whole story.

1301
01:59:41,841 --> 01:59:45,093
我們為她舉辦了葬禮相信我 這不是一件容易的事
we found an undertaker, and it was hard, believe me,

1302
01:59:45,178 --> 01:59:48,430
你知道 因為艾滋病
you know, because of the AIDS.

1303
01:59:48,723 --> 01:59:51,683
我不希望人們因為這個而記住她...
I didn't want people to remember her like that

1304
01:59:51,767 --> 01:59:53,685
因為我不希望人們用這種眼光來看待她
because I didn't want people to see her like that.

1305
01:59:53,769 --> 02:00:00,108
我希望人們能記住她的美... 因為她的確是很美
I wanted them to remember her as beautiful, because that's what she really was.

1306
02:00:41,484 --> 02:00:44,027
生命與死亡...
Life and death,

1307
02:00:44,111 --> 02:00:46,321
活力與安詳
energy and peace.

1308
02:00:46,864 --> 02:00:49,908
如果我今天就死了這一切還是值得了
If I stop today, it was still worth it.

1309
02:00:49,992 --> 02:00:55,497
我所犯的最大的錯誤...和我本可能犯但是沒有犯的
Even the terrible mistakes that I have made and would have unmade if I could.

1310
02:00:55,581 --> 02:00:59,042
以及痛苦已經將我燃燒 令我恐懼
The pains that have burned me and scarred my soul.

1311
02:00:59,126 --> 02:01:00,752
但一切都是值得的...
It was worth it

1312
02:01:00,836 --> 02:01:03,755
因為我已體會過了人間的地獄...
for having been allowed to walk where I've walked,

1313
02:01:03,839 --> 02:01:07,926
體會過了人間的天堂
which was to hell on Earth, heaven on Earth,

1314
02:01:08,010 --> 02:01:13,848
又回到了地獄...又回到了天堂...回到二兩者的距離...經歷它...
back again, into, under, far in between, through it,

1315
02:01:13,933 --> 02:01:16,226
感受它...超越它
in it and above.

1316
02:01:32,944 --> 02:01:37,314
