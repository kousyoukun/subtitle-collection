We had Weimy, our sniper.

He grew up in the middle

things aren't right with the finances

00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:45,600
on numbers inside the camp,
and what about roving patrols?

298
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,686
Maybe eight to ten, bro, but we don't
know anything about roving patrols.

299
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,521
You're just gonna have to assume
that they're out there

are we Iooking at?

302
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,570
Heavy weapons.
These guys are narco-traffickers,

303
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,822
so they can have anything
from Soviet-bloc DShKs.

304
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,742
They could have M2HP,
.50-cals out there, we don't know.

so you're gonna have to assume
that she is non-ambulatory,

But, to be honest with you,

636
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:03,225
I was thinking of calling the command
and trying to get you home.

But now that work's picked up so much,

I didn't need to be there?

thing I needed to do now was go home.

642
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:22,078
But if something went south on your op,

643
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:24,371
I would always regret
not being there with you.

I'm gonna get two weeks off.

either way. I really do.

on your separate ways,

you meet up.

- Roger, Main.

926
01:17:17,090 --> 01:17:19,091
OK, we've got a helo
Ianding on the deck,

927
01:17:19,259 --> 01:17:21,385
we're gonna meet a Mexican
SOF commander and his team.

928
01:17:21,553 --> 01:17:24,388
They're gonna help infil us to
the target and join us on the assault.

929
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:27,767
- What the hell are you talking about?
- We haven't got all of 'em yet, Chief.

930
01:17:27,934 --> 01:17:31,020
- And where's the rest of 'em?
- They're in Mexicali on the border.

931
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:32,813
All right.
And the rest of the boys,

932
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:34,106
how are they getting
back to the ship?

933

Bon Homme Richard
stayed on station.

934
01:17:35,734 --> 01:17:37,652
They're gonna send in a Marine
element to help exploit the target.

935
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:40,071
When they're done, the boys
will pull off with them.

936
01:17:40,238 --> 01:17:43,157
OK. I'm thinking Squad One
and myself roll out.

937
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:45,034
Perfect. Squad Two
stays here, buttons it up,

938
01:17:45,202 --> 01:17:46,952
- pulls out with the Marines.
- OK.

939
01:17:53,377 --> 01:17:55,169

There is something
that you have to understand.

963

My superiors, they're very
fearful of a Mexican Mogadishu.

No Black Hawk Down
is what they're saying,

to stay under the radar.

they're using a tunnel network

It's not far from here.

this is probably the worst.

The cartels control
that area from all angles.

978

They have us heavily outgunned.

979
01:21:25,505 --> 01:21:27,715
Simply reaching your target
is gonna be very difficult.

Sir, we have eight foreign nationals
heading to our country.

Needless to say,
they are no big fan of ours.

that's where we're going.

important letter of your life.

1081
01:37:38,394 --> 01:37:41,437
On behalf of the President
of the United States

1082
01:37:41,605 --> 01:37:45,733
and a grateful nation,
I present you this flag

1083
01:37:45,901 --> 01:37:49,195
in recognition of your
husband's heroic achievements.

1084
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:55,702
You have my
deepest condolences.

1085
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:02,917
One more flag to present.

1086
01:38:03,085 --> 01:38:05,461
This one I think you know.

1087
01:38:06,964 --> 01:38:11,134
On every deployment,
Rorke carried this with him.

1088
01:38:15,139 --> 01:38:17,640
Again, my deepest condolences.

1089
01:38:26,483 --> 01:38:29,110
Lieutenant Engel!

1090
01:38:29,278 --> 01:38:31,905
ALL: Hoo-yah, Lieutenant Engel!

DAVE: Before he died, your father asked me
to give you this poem by Tecumseh.

1093
01:39:41,934 --> 01:39:44,894
I told him I'd fold it
into a paper airplane.

1094
01:39:45,062 --> 01:39:47,814
And, in a way,
I guess that's what I'm doing,

1095
01:39:47,982 --> 01:39:51,109
sailing it from him to you.

1096
01:39:54,405 --> 01:39:56,239
Live your life
that the fear of death

1097
01:39:56,407 --> 01:39:58,574
Can never enter your heart

1098
01:39:58,742 --> 01:40:01,077
Trouble no one about his religion

1099
01:40:01,245 --> 01:40:03,287
Respect others and their views

1100
01:40:03,455 --> 01:40:06,082
(RORKE'S VOICE JOINS IN)
And demand they respect yours

1101
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:09,335
Love your life, perfect your life

1102
01:40:09,503 --> 01:40:12,255
Beautify all things in your life

1103
01:40:12,423 --> 01:40:16,926
RORKE: Seek to make your life long
and of service to your people

1104
01:40:17,094 --> 01:40:19,012
When your time comes to die

1105
01:40:19,179 --> 01:40:22,598
Be not like those whose hearts
are filled with fear of death

1106
01:40:22,766 --> 01:40:24,934
So that when their time comes
they weep and pray

1107
01:40:25,102 --> 01:40:28,938
For a little more time to live their lives
over again in a different way

1108
01:40:29,106 --> 01:40:31,024
Sing your death song

1109
01:40:31,191 --> 01:40:34,193
And die like a hero going home

1110
