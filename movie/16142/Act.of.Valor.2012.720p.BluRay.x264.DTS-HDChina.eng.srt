These guys are narco-traffickers,

303
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:59,825
so they can have anything
from Soviet-bloc DShKs.

304
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:02,744
They could have M2HP,
.50-cals out there, we don't know.

Miss Morales may have bled there, too,
but these guys are savages,

311
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:23,807
so you're gonna have to assume
that she is non-ambulatory,

312
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:26,268

to launch for an SR in two hours.

612
00:49:54,117 --> 00:49:56,411

Why Africa?

614
00:49:58,121 --> 00:50:00,415
We pinned an airfield there
with that phone that you got,

615
00:50:00,582 --> 00:50:04,628
and I think that Shabal is gonna be there
doing a weapons transfer on his way west.

616
00:50:04,794 --> 00:50:07,380
When you say "west," what are
we talking about, Mexico west?

617
00:50:07,547 --> 00:50:11,885
Yeah, Mexico west.
That's worst-case scenario.

618
00:50:12,052 --> 00:50:13,970
You two and the rest of the platoon
are gonna stay here on standby.

something goes down anywhere near America.

You gonna be around for
any questions as they come up?

622
00:50:21,645 --> 00:50:25,941
No, man. Christo... he pulled a Roman
Polanski on my ass and disappeared.

623
00:50:26,107 --> 00:50:27,943
So I'm gonna link up
with SEAL Team Four,

624
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:30,320
and we're gonna go hunt his ass
down in the South Pacific.

625
00:50:30,487 --> 00:50:32,948
So it's straight up Mai Tais
and palm trees for me, baby.

626
00:50:33,114 --> 00:50:34,074
Yeah, brother. Go get him.

Hey, I'm tracking with you, sir. I am.

636
00:50:58,223 --> 00:50:59,808
But, to be honest with you,

637
00:50:59,975 --> 00:51:03,228
I was thinking of calling the command
and trying to get you home.

638
00:51:03,395 --> 00:51:08,149
But now that work's picked up so much,
I feel like we really need you here.

639
00:51:09,484 --> 00:51:11,027
You remember our
last cruise to Al Anbar?

640
00:51:11,194 --> 00:51:13,029
- Yeah.
- When you had that final

641
00:51:13,196 --> 00:51:15,615
turnover op, and you said
I didn't need to be there?

642
00:51:15,782 --> 00:51:19,244
I was laying in bed and I realized the only
thing I needed to do now was go home.

643
00:51:19,411 --> 00:51:22,080
But if something went south on your op,

644
00:51:22,247 --> 00:51:24,374
I would always regret
not being there with you.

645
00:51:24,541 --> 00:51:27,002
I appreciate you taking care
of me big-time, Dave,

with the brass.

647
00:51:29,004 --> 00:51:32,882
If I can, and things slow down,
I'm gonna get two weeks off.

648
00:51:33,049 --> 00:51:36,177
Well, I hope it works out
either way. I really do.

649
00:51:36,344 --> 00:51:39,556
But, if it doesn't,
I'm gonna take this piece of paper,

00:51:39,723 --> 00:51:41,516

into a nice paper airplane.

you're not the same guy you used to be.

785

You're just not.
There's nothing I can do to stop that,

786
01:03:34,770 --> 01:03:37,732
nothing I can do to help you right now,
unless you let me help you.

787
01:03:37,898 --> 01:03:41,444
We need to do this together, pal.
You and me.

788
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:45,323
So how is it that you're working
with these jihadi folks, then?

789

You're Jewish, right?

790
01:03:50,161 --> 01:03:52,246

791
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:57,460
- You got a friend, like, you grew up with?
- Sorry?

792
01:03:57,626 --> 01:03:59,503
Have you ever had a friend
that you grew up with?

793
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:01,881
- Yes.
- Had, like, played interests, played soccer,

794
01:04:02,048 --> 01:04:03,883
or... What would you play?
Baseball, probably, right?

795
01:04:04,050 --> 01:04:05,551
- Probably. Yeah.
- Yeah.

796
01:04:05,718 --> 01:04:07,053
And then you went
on your separate ways,

797
01:04:07,219 --> 01:04:10,014
and then some years later,
you meet up.

798
01:04:10,181 --> 01:04:13,601
And you totally
didn't recognize the person.

799
01:04:13,768 --> 01:04:15,770
And that's what happened with Shabal.

800
01:04:15,936 --> 01:04:18,564
We share a common interest.

801
01:04:18,731 --> 01:04:22,943
So he came up with this incredible idea
because of his beliefs.

802
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:27,406
I don't necessarily share his beliefs,
but he's a smart guy.

- The target's secure, sir.
- This fight isn't over yet.

921
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:03,036
Now, listen, the other half of that cell
is gonna be crossing the border

922
01:17:03,203 --> 01:17:06,540
using a tunnel network
from Mexicali at 0700.

923
01:17:06,706 --> 01:17:09,251
We're coordinating with State,
but for now the birds will drop you off

- Roger, Main.

927
01:17:17,092 --> 01:17:19,094
OK, we've got a helo
landing on the deck,

928
01:17:19,261 --> 01:17:21,388
we're gonna meet a Mexican
SOF commander and his team.

929
01:17:21,555 --> 01:17:24,391
They're gonna help infil us to
the target and join us on the assault.

930
01:17:25,642 --> 01:17:27,769
- What the hell are you talking about?
- We haven't got all of 'em yet, Chief.

931
01:17:27,936 --> 01:17:31,022
- And where's the rest of 'em?
- They're in Mexicali on the border.

932
01:17:31,189 --> 01:17:32,816
All right.
And the rest of the boys,

933
01:17:32,983 --> 01:17:34,109
how are they getting
back to the ship?

935
01:17:35,735 --> 01:17:37,654
They're gonna send in a Marine
element to help exploit the target.

936
01:17:37,821 --> 01:17:40,073
When they're done, the boys
will pull off with them.

937
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:43,160
OK. I'm thinking Squad One
and myself roll out.

938
01:17:43,326 --> 01:17:45,036
Perfect. Squad Two
stays here, buttons it up,

939
01:17:45,203 --> 01:17:46,955
pulls out with the Marines.
- OK.

940
01:17:53,378 --> 01:17:55,172
We're moving north
of here through town,

it wasn't to convince them
to let me go home,

they're using a tunnel network

this is probably the worst.

The cartels control
that area from all angles.

They have us heavily outgunned.

is gonna be very difficult.

Sir, we have eight foreign nationals
heading to our country.

Needless to say,
they are no big fan of ours.
