1
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,954
MAN: Before my father died,
he said the worst thing about growing old

2
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,749
was that other men stopped
seeing you as dangerous.

3
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,358
I've always remembered that, how being
dangerous was sacred, a badge of honor.

4
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,878
You live your life by a code, an ethos.

5
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:02,910
Every man does. It's your shoreline.
It's what guides you home.

6
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,635
And, trust me,
you 're always trying to get home.

7
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,710
MAN OVER RADIO: Authorities say
the ring is centered in Costa Rica,

8
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,393
with the primary export being...

9
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,869
MAN OVER RADIO:...widely unknown if
the war on drugs is connecting them...

10
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,909
MAN OVER RADIO:...in the region
have been known to retaliate using a...

11
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,199
MAN OVER RADIO:
...25,000 troops...

12
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,958
MAN OVER RADIO:
...flying from the US to control that...

13
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,598
Can we get some ice cream?.

14
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,274
- No, we gotta go.
- You always say no.

15
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,398
- Well, are you gonna buy?.
- No, you buy.

16
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,959
OK, what are
we getting today?

17
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,436
- Passion fruit.
- OK, passion fruit.

18
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,274
MAN: How about macadamia nut?.

19
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,912
WOMAN OVER RADIO:
...claimed responsibility for the attack

20
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,872
at the International School in Manila.

21
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,559
MAN: Your father was a reader.

22
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,838
Churchill, of course, but also Faulkner
and books about Tecumseh.

23
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,874
He loved artists who painted people
with bodies that looked like boxes.

24
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,837
I'd give him hell about that.

25
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,831
He 'd Just say,
"You gotta look harder. "

26
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,638
Ambassador Margullies had long
been a strong supporter

27
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,997
of Joint counterterrorism operations
conducted within this region.

28
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,869
Not one group has yet claimed responsibility
for the attacks on the International School.

29
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,792
- Here's your coffee, Rorke.
- Thank you, ma'am.

30
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,871
- How's it going?.
- Hey, you want the usual?.

31
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,349
- Sounds good, thank you.
- You're late again, Dave.

32
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,552
I didn't say anything.

33
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,836
What do you got
going on over here?.

34
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,551
- Are you serious, man?.
- We're not telling anyone yet.

35
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,153
You a little nervous, though, huh?.

36
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,753
Last time I checked,
they don't come with directions.

37
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,353
Yeah, tell me about it.

38
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,430
- Hey.
- Hey.

39
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,318
My man here is having a baby.

40
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,755
Hey, congratulations.

41
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,876
Hey, everybody,
Rorke's having a baby.

42
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,632
WOMAN: Congratulations, Rorke!

43
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,358
Whoo!

44
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,279
- What did I just say?.
- Ah, don't worry about it, man.

45
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,393
You're gonna be awesome. I'm so excited
for you, man. You're gonna be a good dad.

46
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,518
Hey, tomorrow Jackie and I
are heading down to the beach.

47
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,831
Bring Sandy and the kids.
I'll bring an extra board for you.

48
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,070
- You know I don't surf.
- I know you don't surf, but it'll be good

49
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,514
- to get the families together.
- All right.

50
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,275
But now that you've told everyone in the bar,
try and contain yourself tomorrow.

51
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,348
I will try.

52
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,228
DAVE: "Look harder, "
your father would say.

53
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,949
I always knew he wasn't Just talking
about those boxy abstract paintings.

54
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,793
There's threats everywhere,
and the world is draped in camouflage.

55
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,594
CHRISTO: Huh?.

56
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,629
Hey, I'll be right down, all right?.

57
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,434
Whatever you say, Boss.

58
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,509
WOMAN: How was the ride?.

59
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,153
MAN: I left Colombia this morning.

60
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,199
- Colombia to here in one day?.
- Piece of cake.

61
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,396
Anyway, estimates say
that Christo is worth

62
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,795
- close to a billion.
- That's with a "B"?.

63
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,269
Yeah, and he gives back a lot
to this community over here

64
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,995
with medical clinics,
schools, political donations,

65
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,559
you name it, so this is the deal:

66
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,551
They are extremely
loyal to him over here.

67
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,188
When did the DEA hand him over to us?.

68
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,909
When they intercepted a 707 of his
filled with Soviet weapons.

69
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,395
Listen, Langley says that
the boys over at NSA,

70
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,393
they found some interesting
intercepts connecting Christo

71
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,028
to a jihadist network
out of Southeast Asia.

72
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,237
Apparently, Christo and one
of the guys running the network,

73
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,833
they're childhood friends.

74
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,116
DAVE: Your father's
grandfather gave up his life

75
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,840
flying a B-24 in World War II.

76
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,037
He kept the Liberator aloft
just long enough for everyone to jump,

77
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,430
and then he went down
with the plane.

78
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,636
That's the blood
that courses in your veins.

79
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,917
- Daddy, can I come with you?.
- You want to come with me?.

80
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,833
Did you feel how cold it is out there?.
I'll tell you what,

81
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,639
go hang out with Mommy for a little while,
help out with the baby.

82
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,678
When I come back in, if you still want
to go out, I'll take you out with me.

83
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,752
- Promise?.
- I promise. Hurry up, go.

84
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,551
- What's going on, sir?.
- What's up, brother?.

85
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,797
- Nothing much, man.
- Now, I know you got the New York heritage,

86
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,269
but this isn't exactly like
sitting back in Staten Island.

87
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,396
You got to actually work hard
to get through the surf.

88
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,999
- Yeah, I know.
- Twelve-plus years on the Teams,

89
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,354
and you don't know
how to do this?.

90
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,357
Hey, wait till you
have five kids, man.

91
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,437
You'll see how much time
you got to play in the surf.

92
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,158
You ready to get
in the drink or what?.

93
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,634
All right, man, lead the way.

94
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,677
- All right, don't embarrass us.
- All right.

95
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,913
DAVE: Your father was my Boss,
and I was his Chief.

96
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,868
What we knew about each other
strengthened our bond as operators.

97
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,197
There was a brotherhood between us,

98
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,158
and we depended on each other
more than a family.

99
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,791
Tecumseh said,
"Although a single twig will break,

100
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,076
a bundle of twigs is strong. "

101
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,437
OK, OK, gracias.

102
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,716
W ow, this is unbelievable.

103
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,916
I still can't believe you
ordered Chinese in this place.

104
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,389
It's really good.

105
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,194
Double word score,
18 points.

106
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,676
- "Dumb"?.
- Read it and weep, sugar.

107
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,433
I'll try not to.

108
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,717
Look at this, look at this.
Thirty-eight points for me.

109
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,996
"Adumbrating,"
that's not even a word.

110
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,276
OK, first of all,
it's pronounced "adumbrating,"

111
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,079
and it means pretending,
foreshadowing.

112
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,192
Hm...

113
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,709
Guess who's buying dinner
tonight, sugar.

114
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,716
Fine.

115
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,236
In most cases,
officers get tactical partners.

116
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,029
Langley sets me up
with some sort of SCRABBLE hustler.

117
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,078
WOMAN: SCRABBLE Yoda, OK?.
Get it right.

118
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,273
- How much do I owe you?.
- Nada.

119
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,789
Shit.

120
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,593
DAVE: Our platoon
was headed downrange.

121
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,558
We had Weimy, our sniper.

122
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,678
He grew up in the middle
of the MoJave Desert.

123
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,513
Most excitement he found
as a kid was bowling frozen turkeys

124
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,955
down the aisle at the grocery store.

125
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,512
Ray, our comms guy, our radioman,

126
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,274
he grew up in East LA gangland.

127
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,718
He had a Silver Star for pulling
a wounded teammate out of the fray.

128
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,633
Sonny, he was made of granite.

129
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,631
This guy didn 't even do push-ups

130
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,951
'cause he was afraid his chest
was gonna get too big.

131
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,317
AJay Joined the Teams
late in his 30s.

132
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,710
He 'd been a Muay Thai fighter
early in life.

133
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,997
Before that, he grew up
dirt-poor in Trinidad.

134
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,230
Mikey had 20 years in the Teams.

135
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,994
But as humble as he was,
you 'd never even know it.

136
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,392
He kept a picture of his wife in his helmet
and a lock of her hair in his pocket.

137
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,437
Quiet as the breeze.

138
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,072
And finally, Senior Chief.

139
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,669
I couldn 't really
tell you much about him...

140
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,195
... other than I'd rather
take a knife into a gunfight

141
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,998
than have to be interrogated by him.

142
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,597
That last night at home,

143
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,035
you think about how you could
have been a better dad,

144
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,031
a better husband.

145
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,034
That bedtime story you should have read
or that anniversary you forgot.

146
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,953
You don 't expect your family
to understand what you 're doing,

147
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,872
you Just hope they'll accept it.

148
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,953
When you get home, you hope you
can pick up right where you left off.

149
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,588
What up?.

150
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,877
- You putti ng the wild bunch down?.
- Y eah, yeah.

151
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,635
Hey, Senior, you mind giving
us a couple minutes, man?.

152
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,030
- Nah, you got 'em, Jefe.
- Thanks.

153
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,598
Hey, fellas, you know
I only got so many speeches

154
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,877
in a given work-up or deployment, but, uh...

155
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,755
...it's like Chief and I said right
at the beginning of this platoon:

156
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,509
Once we step off on campaign, once this
bird's ready and we're downrange,

157
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,989
everything back home
needs to be in balance.

158
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,878
We're not gonna be worth a damn
to each other or ourselves

159
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,678
if we get over there
and something's out of whack.

160
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,711
I mean, if things
aren't right with the family,

161
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,678
things aren 't right with the finances
or something's off,

162
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,071
it's gonna put us all out of balance, so we
need to have that tight before we launch.

163
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,071
If somebody's got an issue,
bring it up.

164
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,277
Chief can take care of it, I can take care
of it. Everybody's got each other's back.

165
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,074
Let's make sure we lock that down
so when we 're ready to roll,

166
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,276
all our focus is on the mission.

167
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,635
DA VE: For all those
who have been downrange,

168
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,236
to us and those like us,
damn few.

169
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,277
- Cheers.
- Hear, hear.

170
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,153
I still like the name James.

171
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,993
I'll think about it,
if it's a boy.

172
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,349
Come here.

173
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,718
- I'm proud of you.
- Thanks, baby.

174
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,995
Hey, little one, you make sure
you keep Mama away from Aunt Carol.

175
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,196
I don't like that
chain-smoking at all.

176
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,759
I got it, Lieutenant.

177
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,319
- OK.
- It's gonna be OK.

178
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,517
- All right.
- It's gonna be fine.

179
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,469
Try to keep this as long
as you can for a while, yeah?.

180
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,993
Anything else, Commander?

181
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:12,109
Yeah. I'd like to be able to look into
your eyes when our first child is born.

182
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,316
You know I'll do my best.

183
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,197
I love you, baby.

184
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,549
Love you.

185
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,196
DAVE: War is a country of will.

186
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,510
There's no room for sympathy.

187
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:43,356
If you're not willing to give up everything,
you've already lost.

188
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,351
MAN: Tell me, what is it
about you Americans that makes

189
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,080
you feel entitled to fuck
with the way I make my living?

190
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,592
I know who you are, Miss Morales,
and I know who you work for.

191
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,109
So why don't you
save us both some time

192
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,635
and tell me exactly
what you think you know?

193
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,351
CHRISTO: How did that feel,
Miss Morales?

194
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,875
Have a great day at the spa.

195
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,471
MAN ON PHONE: S?, Jefe.

196
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,753
- Hey, fellas, what's up?.
- Hey.

197
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,753
It's hotter than two rats screwing
in a wool sock out there, yeah?.

198
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,990
Africa-hot...
Tarzan couldn't take this heat.

199
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,991
Anyway, here's the deal.
Time to get your frogman on.

200
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,390
Lights. Three days ago,

201
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,518
two CIA agents, a Walter Ross
and a Miss Lisa Morales,

202
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,558
were ambushed inside their
hotel room here in Costa Rica

203
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,876
by a unknown amount
of heavily armed assholes.

204
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,919
Unfortunately, Mr. Ross was murdered,
and Miss Morales has been abducted.

205
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,116
We believe that this has been the work

206
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,840
of a guy named Mikhail Troykavitch,
aka Christo.

207
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,956
LT's going to give you
the skinny on him.

208
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,749
Thanks, Senior.
Mikhail Troykavitch, aka Christo.

209
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,832
This guy is believed to have been
working cocaine-for-weapons deals

210
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,549
between the Russian mafia, the FARC
guerrillas, and the Mexican drug cartels

211
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,517
ever since the late 1 990s.

212
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,195
Now, before she was captured,
Morales was working a possible link

213
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,114
between our boy Christo
and this guy Abu Shabal.

214
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,510
Glory to Allah,
Lord of the worlds,

215
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,318
who has created us as Muslims

216
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,631
and delivered us with the Jihad
on his direct path.

217
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,311
Peace be upon those who follow his
direct path till the Day of Judgment.

218
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,199
Let me explain this to you Americans.

219
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,078
We are not separatists.

220
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,198
We Chechens are not
a legal part of anyone,

221
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,911
but you Americans are willingly
or unwillingly assisting

222
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,790
in the genocide of our people
by demanding that we obey certain rules,

223
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:04,397
and by your continued
occupation of all Muslim countries.

224
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,348
With the grace of Allah,
glorious and exalted is he,

225
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:14,356
America will never be safe
until safety becomes a reality for us.

226
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,636
Allahu Akbar.

227
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,910
LT: Abu Shabal is
a Chechen terrorist

228
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,389
who's associated with
the Beslan School Massacre.

229
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,599
He's been jumping between training camps
in Indonesia and the Philippines.

230
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,230
Now, the connection between Christo
and Abu Shabal is still a little bit fuzzy,

231
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,073
but if this was the lead
that Morales was working on,

232
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,674
it could be why
she was abducted. Senior?.

233
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,559
All right, this is a personnel
recovery of Miss Morales.

234
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,352
All right, who's got questions?

235
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,750
Senior Chief, you got
any updated source intel

236
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,593
on numbers inside the camp,
and what about roving patrols?.

237
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,672
Maybe eight to ten, bro, but we don't
know anything about roving patrols.

238
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,512
You're just gonna have to assume
that they're out there

239
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,750
walking around, squared away.
They do this for a living, too.

240
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,269
Senior, what kind of weapons-on-target
are we looking at?.

241
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,556
Heavy weapons.
These guys are narco-traffickers,

242
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,836
so they can have anything
from Soviet-bloc DShKs.

243
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,753
They could have M2HP,
.50-cals out there, we don't know.

244
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,037
So if there is a weapons' emplacement up
there, I suggest you guys bring rockets.

245
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,749
Of course, rockets and foliage don't match,
so make sure you got a clear shot.

246
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,595
- All right, what else?.
- Any idea whether she's ambulatory or not?.

247
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,273
There was a ton of blood on the scene,

248
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,869
and a lot of it was Mr. Ross',
we confirmed that.

249
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,077
Miss Morales may have bled there, too,
but these guys are savages,

250
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,794
so you're gonna have to assume
that she is non-ambulatory,

251
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,269
so you're gonna have
to bring stuff to carry her out.

252
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,791
MAN OVER PA:
Two minutes to drop.

253
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,634
Hey, LT.

254
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,997
You got to let us know who that guy is,
so when we get back, we can kick his ass.

255
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,037
What guy?.

256
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,714
The guy that gave you
that fucked-up haircut.

257
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,033
- Fuck.
- AJAY: Damn, Sonny,

258
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,317
you should be the last guy to talk.
You look like the Dominican Mr. Clean.

259
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,472
SONNY: That means my head
shines like your gold teeth, huh?.

260
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,756
Don't be like that,

261
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,750
- that's harsh.
- Ramp!

262
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,512
Mask up.

263
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,838
Man, I tell you what. The only thing better
than this right here is being a dad,

264
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,468
except for that whole
changing diaper thing, but...

265
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,756
...Sandy does that for me anyway, so...

266
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,717
I'm actually looking forward to it.

267
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,360
MAN OVER PA:
Blackbeard, green light in ten.

268

274
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,475
All boots are on the ground.
I pass T-bird.

275
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,189
Any traffic for my station
at this time?.

276
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,193

278
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,151
eight clicks from primary target.

The SWCC boats will insert

- Roger that, si r.

282
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,072
We got about 4. 7 clicks
at three-five-five.

283
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,629
T ake it out.

No!

298
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,113
No!

299
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,318
Hey, sir, we gotta go.

300
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,191
Roger. Take it out.

301
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,193
I feel like we're pretty thin.
I'd like to take you guys with us.

302
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,114
Chief, I got a SBT coming up on-step.
I got a Raven pushing my pos.

303
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,713
Weimy and I are
in good overwatch position,

304
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,791
and I got to keep reporting
back to Blackbeard Main.

305
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,871
- We're staying here.
- Roger that.

306
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,279
- Keep it tight.
- Got it.

307
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:22,032
Whiplash, this is Blackbeard.
Assault force is moving to the target early.

308
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,078
Request immediate fire support.

309
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,748
WHIPLASH OVER RADIO:
Blackbeard, it's Whiplash. Good copy.

310
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:31,754
Requesting fire support.
Pushing to your location in 1 5 mikes.

311
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,833
Whiplash, this is Blackbeard.
I have positive control of the Raven.

312
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,232
Chief, are you set?.

313
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,349
RORKE OVER RADIO:
Chief, Chief, hold it.

314
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,558
One o'clock, base of the tower.

315
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,878
RORKE OVER RADIO:
You're clear to the door.

316
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,438
I've got two squirters
coming out the back door.

317
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,989
Going in!

318
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,750
- Clear!
- All clear!

319
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,670
Weimy, eleven o'clock.
Driver's side, truck.

320
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,632
Got him.

321
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,275
Fuck.

322
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,399
- Come on.
- Go in! Go in!

323
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,117
- Clear!
- All clear!

324
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,431
- Target's secure.
- Chief, I'm going to get Mikey.

325
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,473
LT, this is Chief.
Target is secure.

326
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,438
Stand by for confirmation
of the package.

327
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,957
Be advised Mikey is down.
Mikey is down. Status to follow.

328
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,832
Roger. You have the package.

329
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,630
Chief, I got his cell phone.

330
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,759
LT?. LT?.

331
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,913
Chief, looks like you have two aggressor
vehicles approaching from the north,

332
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,231
about one mike out. You can take
the truck outside the west door.

333
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,510
Meet us at extract.

334
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,513
Miss Morales, I'm bringing you home.

335
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,636
I just need to ask you a few questions.

336
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,509
What's your mother's maiden name?.

337
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,359
Rosales.

338
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,476
What street you were born on?.

339
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,390
Hot Springs.

340
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:15,030
All right. Just hang on.

341
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,394
Whiplash, we have enemy QRF
approaching from the north.

342
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,394
Roger. You have enemy QRF
coming in from the north.

343
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,676
Chief, you need to start your exfil now.

344
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,354
- We'll meet you at secondary extract.
- Roger that.

345
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,232
Hey, boys, we gotta roll!

346
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,588
Shit. Sir, it's those trucks,

347
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,159
- about 1,000 yards.
- Yep.

348
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,072
Ma'am, I'm taking you out right now.

349
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,596
Hey, Chief, he took a round to the eye
with the exit wound behind the ear.

350
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,035
He's alive, but we gotta get moving now!

351
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,592
Weimy, coming out.

352
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,352
OVER RADIO:
We'll meet you at the rally point.

353
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,396
Let's go! Let's go! Move it!

354
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,751
- Heads up! Fast movement on the left!
- Right turn! Right turn!

355
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,516
Hey, man, we're not going
to make it to secondary extract.

356
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,557
I got to find us a route.
Stay on this road.

357
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,598
- Left, left, left.
- Left turn! Left turn!

358
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,113
Mikey, come on, buddy.

359
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,353
Hey, Chief!

360
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,270
We're not gonna make secondary extract!

361
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,273
- You're gonna have to figure it out, man!
- Hold on!

362
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,396
Come on. Stay with me.
Stay with me.

363
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,155
Stay with us.

364
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,198
Come on, Mike. Wake up.
Wake up. Come on, man.

365
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,438
- Contact!
- Pick it up, pick it up.

366
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,068
Yo, Chief!
We can make it to rally point!

367
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,516
- Sounds good! Pass it to LT!
- Come on, man.

368
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:52,559
LT, LT, this is assault team.
We just lost the secondary extract.

369
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,109
I say again, we just lost
secondary extract.

370
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,838
Moving to rally point.
How copy, over?.

371
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,912
- We're about a click out.
- Mikey, wake up.

372
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,869
One click out!

373
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,870
Let's go, Mike.
Wake up. Come on, buddy.

374
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,469
Come on, Mikey! Wake up!

375
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,078
- Good?.
- Backstage clear.

376
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,914
Rocket out!

377
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,638
He's not breathing!

378
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,597
- Breathe, Mikey!
- We're up! We're up!

379
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,111
Chief, let me get your M-4!

380
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,671
Sir, what's the status
on those boats?.

381
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,552
I lost Whiplash on the run.

382
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,672
Told 'em you hit the target early.
They're coming in hot.

383
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,877
- Roger that.
- Fuck! Take this, man.

384
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,189
Breathe, Mikey. Come on, Mikey.

385
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,396
- I got no pulse.
- Contact rear!

386
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,589
Contact rear!

387
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,833
Holy shit!

388
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,989
Taking rounds in...

389
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,230
Pick it up. Pick it up.

390
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,950
Ajay! QRF coming up the rear!

391
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,192
Whiplash! Whiplash!
Secondary extract is burnt.

392
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,038
Moving to tertiary extract.

393
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,112
I have eight packs,
seven Sierras, one package.

394
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,548
OVER RADIO: Package
with multiple wounds.

395
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,154
The Sierra has gunshot wound
to the head.

396
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,390
This will be a hot extract.

397
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,159
What the fuck?.!

398
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,912
- Oh, shit!
- Mikey, stay down!

399
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,150
- Keep him down, man!
- MIKEY: Where the fuck am I?.!

400
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,073
- Calm down, brother.
- Mikey's up, man. Mikey's up.

401
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,198
Stay down, brother. Calm.
Be easy. We're almost out of here.

402
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,429
We're almost out of here.

403
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,559
Mikey!

404
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,199
- Hang on, buddy.
- MIKEY: Where are we?.

405
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,078
- We're on our way to extract.
- What happened?.

406
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,832
You're good to go.
You took one to the face, man.

407
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,109
You're a hard motherfucker.

408
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,395
- Did we get her?.
- Yes.

409
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,834
- Oh, my God.
- We're on our way to extract.

410
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,395
Ajay, splash it. Splash it.

411
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,632
Water! Water! Water!

412
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,675
Going in! Going in!

413
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,715
I got her! I got her!

414
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,995
It's fucking going under.

415
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,832
Out! Get the fuck out!

416
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,999
ECHOING: It wasn't for nothing.

417
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,232
You know, from time to time,

418
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,188
I get to see my old friends
from my old life.

419
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,071
And it's always, always disappointing.

420
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,120
Some become assholes,
other boring,

421
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,317
and I can't believe I tried to get them
in bed all those years ago.

422
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,431
Hey.

423
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,830
It is nice not to be disappointed, Yuri.

424
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,710
- That's not my name.
- I know.

425
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,230
Mohammed Abu Shabal,
the son of Shabal.

426
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,198
Come on.
Your father's name is Yevgeny.

427
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:08,559
Things change.

428
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,192
Yeah, things have changed.

429
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:15,636
That's why this is the last time we might
have to see each other for quite some time.

430
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,917
For I might have
to find a hole to hide in.

431
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,519
I don't understand.

432
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:28,593
I'm being watched by the CIA,
and I'm not taking any chances.

433
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:32,435
As soon as the opportunity presents itself,
I'm taking my family south.

434
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,750
I neither have the energy or the will
to fight the Americans.

435
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,593
What about our deal, Mikhail?.

436
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,194
My men have been training
for almost a year now.

437
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:43,318
- I have devoted much of my resources...
- The deal stands, Yuri.

438
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,630
Just because I've taken
early retirement does not mean

439
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,114
I'm not holding up
my end of the bargain.

440
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,269
There is so much to be done.

441
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,193
And it will be, just without me.

442
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,918
You'll have to use
my trusted associates.

443
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,798
That's not so good for me.

444
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,188
- Hey...
- Hey! Shut up!

445
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,035
Shut up!

446
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,589
Stop your fucking bullshit!

447
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:03,558
It's not good. Doesn't work.
You can't change it like that.

448
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:06,553
- Nothing changes. Nothing.
- You just told me everything's changed.

449
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,433
What... What is that?.
What is that?.

450
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,477
Do you know what I do to get here?.!

451
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,074
Do you know the men who I've
had to sacrifice to get here?.!

452
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,555
Do you have any idea?.!

453
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,790
No, you shit! You live up here
in this ivory tower!

454
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,996
You have no... You don't care!

455
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,320
Hey, Chief, what's the status on Mikey?.

456
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:45,036
He's definitely gonna lose the eye,
but he's... he's hanging tough.

457
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,671
Hey, I'm gonna get right into this.

458
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:51,354
Great job smoke-checking those
assholes and getting Morales back.

459
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,512
It's a bum deal for Mikey, but I gotta
tell you what, that was solid work.

460
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,671
So, Chief, you make sure you get
that down to the boys right away.

461
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:57,989
- You hear me?.
- Check.

462
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,988
All right. Now, Morales,
Morales was one tough chick,

463
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,469
but she should've gotten
the stuff up the chain a lot faster

464
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,790
because this thing is way
bigger than we thought it was.

465
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,231
How is that?. I thought this was
a cut-and-dry AMCIT recovery.

466
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,836
Yeah, it was until we got into that phone
that you guys picked up in that shithole.

467
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,639
It turned me on to something
that just does not look right at all.

468
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,712
- And what's not right about it?.
- Christo and Shabal are a lot closer

469
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,553
than I thought they were,
and Shabal is a wild card, man.

470
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:26,429
He is an old-school jihadi that couldn't
give a rat's ass about money or drugs.

471
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,716
Yeah, and his childhood friend,
Christo, the dope dealer?.

472
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,270
He is not a dealer, man.
He's a smuggler.

473
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,716
- You have got to be kidding me.
- That is exactly what I'm thinking.

474
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,552
Shabal wants to kill Americans.

475
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:40,871
Christo knows how to get
fuckers inside America.

476
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,355
This could be big trouble
in little China, fellas.

477
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,033
They're gonna hit us at home.

478
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,520
I just got done talking to the boss
and the Spec Ops Task Force,

479
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,033
and this is what's gonna go down.

480
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,953
I need Ajay and Ray standing by
to launch for an SR in two hours.

481
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,395
They're gonna get some
frequent flyer miles on the way to Africa.

482
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,959
Why Africa?.

483
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,395
We pinned an airfield there
with that phone that you got,

484
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:04,639
and I think that Shabal is gonna be there
doing a weapons transfer on his way west.

485
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,360
When you say "west," what are
we talking about, Mexico west?

486
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:11,872
Yeah, Mexico west.
That's worst-case scenario.

487
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,951
You two and the rest of the platoon
are gonna stay here on standby.

488
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:17,396
You'll be the primary assault force in case
something goes down anywhere near America.

489
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,357
- Check.
- Check.

490
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,476
You gonna be around for
any questions as they come up?.

491
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:25,918
No, man. Christo... he pulled a Roman
Polanski on my ass and disappeared.

492
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,951
So I'm gonna link up
with SEAL Team Four,

493
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,315
and we're gonna go hunt his ass
down in the South Pacific.

494
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,948
So it's straight up Mai Tais
and palm trees for me, baby.

495
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,075
Yeah, brother. Go get him.

496
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,434
- You be cool.
- Take it easy.

497
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,591
Good luck with that baby, Lieutenant.

498
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,115
- Does everybody know?.
- Only the important people.

499
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,669
The important people to who?. You?.

500
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:47,479
I guess so.

501
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:50,598
- I'm gonna go brief the boys.
- Hey, hold on one second.

502
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,196
Hey, brother, I've never
written one of these before.

503
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,034
Hey, I'm tracking with you, sir. I am.

504
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,798
But, to be honest with you,

505
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:03,236
I was thinking of calling the command
and trying to get you home.

506
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:08,155
But now that work's picked up so much,
I feel like we really need you here.

507
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,038
You remember our
last cruise to Al Anbar?.

508
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,031
- Yeah.
- When you had that final

509
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,589
turnover op, and you said
I didn't need to be there?.

510
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:19,236
I was laying in bed and I realized the only
thing I needed to do now was go home.

511
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,073
But if something went south on your op,

512
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,356
I would always regret
not being there with you.

513
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,988
I appreciate you taking care
of me big-time, Dave,

514
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,832
but I'm working some things
with the brass.

515
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,879
If I can, and things slow down,
I'm gonna get two weeks off.

516
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,157
Well, I hope it works out
either way. I really do.

517
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:39,557
But, if it doesn't,
I'm gonna take this piece of paper,

518
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,517
and I'm gonna make it
into a nice paper airplane.

519
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,638
Beat it.

520
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,037
We're good, we're good!

521
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,516
MAN: Chief of the Watch,
submerge the ship to one-six-zero feet.

522
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,477
Dive. Dive.

523
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,433
OVER RADIO: Scope down.
All doors are green.

524
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,118
- Oh, good. Hey, guys.
- Sir.

525
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,599
- Thank you for getting here so fast.
- Sure.

526
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,392
- Grab a seat, please.
- Thank you.

527
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,118
You'll have Bulldog overhead.

528
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,271
We need you to get in,
grab the intel

529
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:30,432
and bounce it back to us.
Do you have any questions?.

530
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,279
Sir, I have a question.
We have the rally point and time.

531
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,471
What if the meeting
doesn't take place as scheduled?.

532
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,870
How long do you
want us to stay on target?

533
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:41,794
Now, this one counts, so I'd plan
on being out there for a while.

534
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,110
- Check.
- Are we good?.

535
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,469
- Think so, sir.
- Yes, sir.

536
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:59,155
MAN: Ray and Ajay are rigged up
and ready to check each other out.

537
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,633
OVER RADIO: Garage door clear.

538
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,993
- You got a visual?.
- Yeah.

539
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,037
Got three trucks moving in.

540
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:26,159
A fuel truck, two jeeps,
some skinnies in the back.

541
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,958
One of them has a.50-cal.

542
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,235
You hear that?.

543
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,595
- Yeah, I think that's our plane.
- Yeah, we got some inbound.

544
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,910
'Bout time these guys showed up.
Jesus. Let me get my camera.

545
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,838
Hey, Ray, we got two birds
down at the end of the field,

546
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,074
southeast our pos, no tail IDs.

547
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:23,879
- You got that?.
- Check, no tail IDs.

548
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,913
Ray, last time I checked,
we were in Africa, right?

549
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:37,678
Yeah. Why, what's up?.

550
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:42,989
Dude, there's, like,
1 6 Filipinos down there,

551
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,593
all praying to Mecca right now.

552
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,558
- Filipinos?.
- Filipinos. Definitely not skinnies.

553
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:50,837
I'm picking up the praying.
I'm also picking up some Russian.

554
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:25,669
RAY: Bulldog, Bulldog, Redrum,
radio check, over.

555
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:28,149
- MAN OVER RADIO: Good check, copy.
- RAY: Roger, good check.

556
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,231
Be advised, we got two sterile aircraft

557
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:34,109
departing to the east
from following location:

558
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:37,158
Ten, Papa, Lima, Sierra.

559
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,595
Please advise when tally target, over.

560
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:43,196
MAN OVER RADIO: Roger.
Copy, two aircraft, location Ten, Papa...

561
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:46,875
RORKE: Hey, Chief, you are
not gonna believe this.

562
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,473
One of the planes Ray and Ajay tagged

563
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,870
just landed on Cedros Island
off the coast of Mexico.

564
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:54,032
It has Shabal on it with an
unknown number of jihadis.

565
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:55,434
Are you kidding me?

566
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,352
No, looks like we're gonna
get to hit that target.

567
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,556
Well, Senior and the SWCC
boats are punching out.

568
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:02,439
They should pull a little more
intel for us, so we'll see.

569
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,079
All right.

570
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:34,032
I don't know how long we're staying.
Hold on, baby.

571
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,476
- Be safe.
- You know I will.

572
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:44,108
- I gotta go, honey.
- I love you.

573
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:46,111
I love you.

574
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,437
MAN OVER RADIO:
Bravo Alpha, we're 200 meters out.

575
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,671
Bravo, you have a Tango
on your starboard side.

576
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,512
MAN 2 OVER RADIO:
Tango on the starboard side.

577
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,394
MAN OVER RADIO: Whiskey Charlie,
we have a visual on Tango.

578
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:21,390
Bravo, you have a Viper at twelve o 'clock.

579
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,233
Get down! Get down!

580
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:56,234
Clear! Bridge secure.

581
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,279
MAN OVER RADIO:
Senior, you're clear.

582
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:37,640
- English OK?. Let's do that.
- English is fine.

583
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,518
Can you cut him loose, please?.

584
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,671
If you get cut loose, you're not
gonna do anything crazy, are you?.

585
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:45,031
A Crazy Ivan?. So to speak.

586
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,475
So you're Russian, yeah?.

587
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:50,148
- Yes, I am.
- You all right?.

588
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:52,834
- Yes, I'm good. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

589
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,353
I'm sorry.
I don't know your name.

590
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:55,595
- I'm Otto.
- Otto.

591
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,478
- Yes. And you are?.
- Nice to meet you.

592
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:58,675
Christo.

593
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,592
- Crisco?.
- Christo.

594
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:03,517
Troskawicz?.

595
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,636
So how long am I gonna need
to keep busting your balls

596
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,916
about getting one of those patches?.

597
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:10,355
Ah, yeah, I think it was,
like, a one-time deal, man.

598
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:13,353
After 9/1 1, my uncle sent
a bunch out for the platoon,

599
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:16,478
but, uh, after this go-round,
I'll give it to you.

600
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,471
No, no, I'm not gonna
take your family crest.

601
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,154
All right, good.
I didn't want to give it to you anyway.

602
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:23,151
Besides, man,
I'm pretty sure I saw you

603
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:25,231
putting something in your
cargo pocket the other day.

604
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:29,029
- What's that?.
- I know I've seen you carrying

605
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,918
something in that pocket right there.

606
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:33,555
What is it?.

607
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:35,989
That's my grandfather's flag.

608
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,752
- Nice.
- My pop gave it to me,

609
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,558
and now I'm gonna
give it to my boy someday.

610
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:41,711
All right. I like that.

611
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,198
You're sitting on a wonderful boat.

612
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:54,509
- It's fabulous.
- Thank you. Yes.

613
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:56,989
- I believe it's called Starship.
- "Starship. "

614
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:58,479
I love the way you say Starship.

615
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:01,154
It's like Russian.
That guy, uh... Star Trek.

616
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:03,390
What's his name, Scotty?.
Oh, no, he was, sorry, Scott.

617
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:05,915
- I wouldn't know.
- Yes. You've never seen Star Trek?.

618
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:07,752
- No.
- Oh, that's insane.

619
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,353
- So here's the problem, pal.
- Mm-hm?.

620
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,556
You're worth a lot of money.

621
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,911
- Or you were worth a lot of money.
- I believe I still am.

622
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:16,195
- You do?.
- Yes.

623
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:20,069
All right. Let me tell you
how the world works there, Crisco.

624
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,798
- It's Christo.
- Sorry?.

625
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:23,598
- Christo.
- Oh, of course. Sorry.

626
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:24,988
It's OK.

627
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:26,559
Let me tell you
how the world really works.

628
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:27,914
- Please.
- This is no longer your boat.

629
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:31,231
Since I walked through that door,
you're not the same guy you used to be.

630
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:34,597
You're just not.
There's nothing I can do to stop that,

631
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:37,718
nothing I can do to help you right now,
unless you let me help you.

632
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:41,429
We need to do this together, pal.
You and me.

633
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:45,309
So how is it that you're working
with these jihadi folks, then?

634
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:48,069
You're Jewish, right?.

635
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,230
Shabal is what?.

636
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:57,438
- You got a friend, like, you grew up with?.
- Sorry?.

637
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:59,517
Have you ever had a friend
that you grew up with?.

638
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,875
- Yes.
- Had, like, played interests, played soccer,

639
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:03,871
or... What would you play?.
Baseball, probably, right?.

640
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,553
- Probably. Yeah.
- Yeah.

641
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:07,039
And then you went
on your separate ways,

642
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,998
and then some years later,
you meet up.

643
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:13,596
And you totally
didn't recognize the person.

644
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,751
And that's what happened with Shabal.

645
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,559
We share a common interest.

646
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:22,952
So he came up with this incredible idea
because of his beliefs.

647
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:27,398
I don't necessarily share his beliefs,
but he's a smart guy.

648
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,551
You know, it's almost like...

649
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,318
...you know, it's almost like...

650
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:32,595
...Iike this is me.

651
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:41,079
- And that's Shabal.
- Is it?.

652
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,196
- And America is in-between.
- Is it?.

653
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:44,429
Yeah.

654
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,188
Cool concept, no?.

655
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:48,879
- Right here?.
- Yes.

656
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:52,396
You think this is some kind of game?.

657
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,836
- Do you?. Do you find this amusing?.
- No. No.

658
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,956
- I'm not finding...
- Do you realize what you're doing here?.

659
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,189
MAN OVER RADIO: Blackbeard Actual,
this is Blackbeard Main.

660
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:04,669
Post nation counterpart.
Secured target Bravo.

661
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:07,991
Report to Tri-Hull.
You're clear to move on target Alpha.

662
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,833
MAN 2 OVER RADIO: Roger, Main.
Clear to target.

663
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,391
The only people
I answer to is my family.

664
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:19,830
T o my wife and to my child.

665
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,070
And nobody else.

666
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:25,357
- Running late somewhere?.
- Shit filter's full.

667
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:26,709
- Really?.
- Yeah.

668
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:30,316
So here's the problem, pal.

669
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,311
You do love your family, don't you?.

670
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:35,550
- Yes, I do.
- And what about your daughter?.

671
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:37,153
What about my daughter?.

672
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:39,151
Are you looking forward
to seeing her again?.

673
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:40,958
Every minute of my life.

674
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:08,197
I wanted you to see that so that you'd
think about some things very seriously,

675
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,914
because you're gonna be
sitting in a box somewhere.

676
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:14,868
You'll be treated properly
and humanely.

677
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:20,838
That girl is gonna grow up,
and she's gonna get married,

678
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,231
and your wife is gonna find someone else,

679
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,312
and you're gonna miss everything.

680
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:37,956
If I had done something
that would endanger my family,

681
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:40,236
I would feel just
like you do right now.

682
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:45,031
You promise not
to touch my family?.

683
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,077
I would never touch your family.

684
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:49,509
I would not.

685
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,039
Are you familiar with...

686
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:01,953
...ceramic ball bearings?.

687
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:03,513
No.

688
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:06,875
Just imagine 1 6 suicide vests

689
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:09,116
filled with those
ceramic ball bearings,

690
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:13,751
slipping by every metal detector
and every checkpoint in your country.

691
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:17,794
You think your economy
is fucked now?.

692
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:23,119
Just think what the media
is gonna do with this. Hm?.

693
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:26,636
It's gonna make 9/1 1 look like
a fucking walk in the park.

694
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,711
The grand Central Park.

695
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,752
So you're telling me...

696
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:38,916
...there's 1 6 jihadis
wearing suicide vests.

697
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:42,477
They're gonna walk
right across the border.

698
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,158
So where are they going?.

699
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:49,758
San Diego, San Francisco, Houston...

700
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:51,632
You pick a city, they'll be there.

701
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:56,078
- And this is happening now?.
- It's happening as we speak.

702
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:58,314
Sorry, what?.

703
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,914
It's happening as we speak.

704
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:06,197
How can you stop this?

705
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,238
I can't.

706
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:03,597
Blackbeard Lead,
containment element is set.

707
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:04,949
Roger.

708
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:45,952
Gun! Gun! Gun!

709
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,955
Clear!

710
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:51,075
- Go.
- Coming out!

711
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:59,114
Rat Pack, this is Blackbeard. We're in
contact, midtown, south of the church.

712
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:10,557
Contact!

713
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:26,638
Contact!

714
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:30,950
Changing!

715
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:39,037
Blackbeard Lead, what's your pos?.

716
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:41,156
RORKE OVER RADIO: Overwatch.
You're clear to engage.

717
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:43,355
Go in hot.

718
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,678
Frag out!

719
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,197
Weimy, I've got two squirters
heading south in a pickup truck.

720
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:24,949
I see 'em.

721
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:31,072
Hit those two guys in the truck.

722
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:53,395
Rocket!

723
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:02,708
Frag out!

724
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,791
Sir?. Sir?.

725
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,679
LT?. You all right?.

726
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:14,749
Damn.

727
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:16,717
You check that box, huh?.

728
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,199
Yeah.

729
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:21,678
Good thing that was a dud.
I might've gotten hurt.

730
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:24,957
- Yeah.
- Whoa.

731
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:28,599
Jesus.

732
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,197
This is not some bush-league
vest from an Iraqi hut.

733
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:36,679
This is some high-speed shit.

734
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:40,549
Maybe we should put this
somewhere else, huh?.

735
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:50,710
Hey, Sonny, find somewhere
to put this, would you?.

736
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:00,318
Target secure.
Set security.

737
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:02,869
One's to the north, three south.

738
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:49,393
Hey, Chief, target's buttoned up.

739
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:51,551
- Everything's secure.
- Thanks, man.

740
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:54,678
WOMAN OVER RADIO: Actual, mission
not complete. Stand by for follow-on.

741
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,677
You only got half that jihadist cell.

742
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:00,031
- The target's secure, sir.
- This fight isn't over yet.

743
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:03,033
Now, listen, the other half of that cell
is gonna be crossing the border

744
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:06,510
using a tunnel network
from Mexicali at 0700.

745
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:09,234
We're coordinating with State,
but for now the birds will drop you off

746
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:12,710
outside the city where your POC
is a Commander Pedros.

747
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:14,632
I'll give you more details en route.

748
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,916
- Actual, how do you copy?
- Roger, Main.

749
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:19,071
OK, we've got a helo
landing on the deck,

750
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:21,390
we're gonna meet a Mexican
SOF commander and his team.

751
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:24,393
They're gonna help infil us to
the target and join us on the assault.

752
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,756
- What the hell are you talking about?.
- We haven't got all of 'em yet, Chief.

753
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:31,037
- And where's the rest of 'em?.
- They're in Mexicali on the border.

754
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:32,792
All right.
And the rest of the boys,

755
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,115
how are they getting
back to the ship?.

756
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:35,554
Bon Homme Richard
stayed on station.

757
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:37,631
They're gonna send in a Marine
element to help exploit the target.

758
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:40,075
When they're done, the boys
will pull off with them.

759
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:43,152
OK. I'm thinking Squad One
and myself roll out.

760
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:45,038
Perfect. Squad Two
stays here, buttons it up,

761
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:46,952
- pulls out with the Marines.
- OK.

762
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:55,157
We're moving north
of here through town,

763
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:56,912
and crossing at sunrise.

764
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:59,833
The other group will get
into Texas the following day,

765
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,433
through Juarez.

766
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,233
?Comprendes?

767
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:20,079
Hey, sir! Who the hell cleared us hot
to go to Mexicali anyway?.

768
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:22,435
This one's going all
the way up the flagpole.

769
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:24,238
State Department's on it.

770
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:05,834
Hey, sir. Channel two.

771
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,632
Hey, this tempo keeps up like this,

772
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:15,314
Jackie's gonna be squeezing
that kid out on her own.

773
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:20,916
However, we hit this target quick enough,
you jump on a burro and ride that shit home.

774
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:24,595
Hey, I ain't gonna need no burro.

775
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:27,473
Did you get your two weeks?.

776
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:29,870
All that time I was
spending on the sat phone,

777
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:32,349
it wasn't to convince them
to let me go home,

778
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:34,590
it was to convince them
to leave your ass in charge.

779
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:44,470
- Sir.
- Lieutenant.

780
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:46,756
Seems our governments have been
very busy to make this possible, huh?.

781
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:48,353
All the way to the top,
from what I hear.

782
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:50,397
There is something
that you have to understand.

783
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:54,348
My superiors, they're very
fearful of a Mexican Mogadishu.

784
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:56,590
No Black Hawk Down
is what they're saying,

785
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:58,352
so we do need
to stay under the radar.

786
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,476
- I understand completely, sir.
- Good.

787
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:03,473
Your team's presence here is greatly
appreciated, but we are out of time.

788
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:05,153
- We need to move.
- Tell me where, we go.

789
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:06,355
Help piece this together for me.

790
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:07,839
- OK.
- Our intel says

791
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,639
they're using a tunnel network
that is under a milk factory.

792
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:12,796
This mean anything to you?.

793
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,349
I know exactly where that is.
It's not far from here.

794
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,192
Then that's where we're going.

795
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:19,157
Of all of the places in Mexicali

796
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:21,311
that you could have picked,
this is probably the worst.

797
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:23,511
The cartels control
that area from all angles.

798
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:25,318
They have us heavily outgunned.

799
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:27,715
Simply reaching your target
is gonna be very difficult.

800
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:30,474
Sir, we have eight foreign nationals
heading to our country.

801
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:32,949
Needless to say,
they are no big fan of ours.

802
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:35,315
If they are at that factory,
that's where we're going.

803
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:37,630
Lieutenant, I'll take you
anywhere you need to go,

804
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:40,792
but prepare your men for a bigger fight
than what you had imagined.

805
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:44,157
You're not fighting eight men. You're also
fighting the cartel that's protecting them.

806
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,550
If your targets make it
into those tunnels,

807
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:48,711
they'll disappear like ghosts.

808
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:32,872
You enter the tunnels right here.

809
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:35,156
You will walk
seven miles to this fork.

810
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:36,918
My men will tell you
what tunnel to take.

811
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:41,596
Once you get to this point,
my job is done.

812
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:43,557
You're on your own.

813
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:14,953
- Lieutenant, we're going now!
- Roger that.

814
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:40,639
Chief, we're not stopping.
We're rolling up on target, hard.

815
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:43,434
Roger that, sir.
We're about 30 seconds out.

816
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:00,912
RORKE OVER RADIO: One mike out
from the south entrance.

817
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:37,552
Jefe! On the roof!

818
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:51,196
We gotta go. Now.

819
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:26,358
Sir! Leave two men here!

820
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:56,069
Weimy!

821
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:00,909
Weimy!

822
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:03,235
I need you
to lock this shit down!

823
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:13,308
Frag out!

824
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,028
On me.

825
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:44,796
You guys got the gate!

826
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:47,520
Call! You're going to the front door!

827
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:51,638
Go!

828
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,234
Call!

829
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:12,268
Changing!

830
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:54,155
Damn it, sir.

831
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:55,639
How you gonna explain
that one to my family?.

832
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:58,149
Get back there
so I don't have to, huh?.

833
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:15,708
Clear!

834
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:40,510
Grenade!

835
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:41,068
LT!

836
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:46,079
Chief, I got him.

837
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:10,712
Keep going. I'll cover you.

838
01:34:58,080 --> 01:34:59,274
Chief.

839
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:06,713
Chief!

840
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:11,430
SONNY: Assault Two,
this is Assault One.

841
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:15,792
Be advised, tunnel is secure
and all threats are neutralized.

842
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:18,110
LT and Chief are down.

843
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:21,272
OVER RADIO: I say again,
LT and Chief are down.

844
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:19,717
DAVE: Your father was a good man.

845
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:22,314
Growing up without him
is gonna be hard.

846
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:24,471
It's gonna hurt.

847
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:28,599
You'll feel alone, out to sea,
with no shore in sight.

848
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:32,793
You'll wonder,
"Why me? Why him? "

849
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:48,831
Remember, you have
warrior's blood in your veins.

850
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,912
The code that made your father
who he was is the same code

851
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:55,834
that'll make you a man
he would admire, respect.

852
01:36:57,320 --> 01:37:00,630
Put your pain in a box.
Lock it down.

853
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:03,837
Like those people in the
paintings your father liked,

854
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:08,556
we are men made up of boxes,
chambers of loss and triumph,

855
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:12,076
of hurt and hope and love.

856
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:15,839
- No one is stronger or more dangerous...
- Ready!

857
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,718
-... than a man who can harness his emotions.
- Aim!

858
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:20,235
His past.

859
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:24,279
Aim!

860
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:27,870
Aim!

861
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:33,272
DAVE: Use it as fuel,
as ammunition,

862
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:36,910
as ink to write the most
important letter of your life.

863
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:41,437
On behalf of the President
of the United States

864
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:45,718
and a grateful nation,
I present you this flag

865
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:49,196
in recognition of your
husband's heroic achievements.

866
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:55,714
You have my
deepest condolences.

867
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:02,915
One more flag to present.

868
01:38:03,080 --> 01:38:05,469
This one I think you know.

869
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:11,112
On every deployment,
Rorke carried this with him.

870
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:17,634
Again, my deepest condolences.

871
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:29,119
Lieutenant Engel!

872
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:31,919
ALL: Hoo-yah, Lieutenant Engel!

873
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:41,758
DAVE: Before he died, your father asked me
to give you this poem by Tecumseh.

874
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:44,878
I told him I'd fold it
into a paper airplane.

875
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:47,799
And, in a way,
I guess that's what I'm doing,

876
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,117
sailing it from him to you.

877
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:56,231
Live your life
that the fear of death

878
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:58,550
Can never enter your heart

879
01:39:58,760 --> 01:40:01,069
Trouble no one about his religion

880
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:03,276
Respect others and their views

881
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:06,079
And demand they respect yours

882
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:09,312
Love your life, perfect your life

883
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:12,239
Beautify all things in your life

884
01:40:12,440 --> 01:40:16,911
RORKE: Seek to make your life long
and of service to your people

885
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:18,991
When your time comes to die

886
01:40:19,160 --> 01:40:22,596
Be not like those whose hearts
are filled with fear of death

887
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:24,910
So that when their time comes
they weep and pray

888
01:40:25,120 --> 01:40:28,908
For a little more time to live their lives
over again in a different way

889
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:31,031
Sing your death song

890
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:34,192
And die like a hero going home

891
01:50:13,200 --> 01:50:14,030
