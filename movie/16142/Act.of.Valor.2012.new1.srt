Anyway, estimate says that Christo worth close to a million

84
00:07:56,835 --> 00:07:57,213
他值这么多?

00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:01,305
是啊 而且这里的社区都有他的捐款

装满苏联武器的707的时候吧

和东南亚的恐怖组织有关

on World War II

98
00:08:36,957 --> 00:08:39,639
为了给战友争取跳伞时间 他坚持驾驶
He kept to level her just long enough for everyone else to jump

99
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:41,395
才因来不及跳伞而和飞机一起坠毁
and then he went down with the plane

100

你知道怎么冲吗?
And you don't know  how to do this?

115
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:21,096
等有了五个孩子 你就懂了 伙计

166
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,168
只要让他们明白

167
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,330
你是为了他们才这么做 那就够了

潜心于部署 但是
and give in work-up for the deployment, but uh...

175
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,090
正如我和士官长所说 一旦入队
It's like Chief and I said, right at the beginning of this platoon

176
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:54,569
一旦我们步入战场 一旦我们整装待发
Once we step off on campaign, once it reversed ready for downranged, 

177
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:57,040
一心回家的念头就该抛之脑后
everything back home is be unbalanced

178
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,335
虽不知会谁死谁生 但步入战场 
we will not worth the dead of each other or self, 

179
00:14:00,336 --> 00:14:01,650
我们要心无留恋
we get over there, something out of recommendative

180
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:05,309
家中纠纷 钱财紧缺还有其他一些琐事 
Things aren't right with the family, 

181
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,270
你都需抛之脑后 所以
things aren't right with the finance or something's off. It's gonna put us all out of balance. So..

182
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,460
这点在出发前每个人都要铭记于心
we need to had that typed before we launch.

183
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,250
还有疑问吗 现在就说

士官长会关照 我也会 
Chief can take care, I can take care. 

185
00:14:12,506 --> 00:14:13,990
这里的每个人都是彼此的后盾
Everybody's got each other's back.

186
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,520
出发前希望大家明确一点 
Let's make sure we lock that down,

187
00:14:16,521 --> 00:14:18,850
完成任务是我们唯一的目的
when we ride or roll. All our focus is on the mission.

188
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:24,440
为那些已经牺牲的战友
For all those been downranged, 

189

为我们和爱我们的人 干杯!

战争是国家意志的体现
War is a country of will

204
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,490
容不得半点同情
there's no room for sympathy

205

如果你不愿放弃一切

00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,165
艾比・莎保是一个车臣恐怖分子
Abu shabal is a Chechen terrorist

267
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,330
他与斯兰学校大屠杀事件有关
 that associated with the Beslan school massacre

268
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:33,420
他周旋于印度尼西亚和菲律宾的士兵集训营
He's been jumping between training camps in Indonesia and the Philippines

269
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,190
如今 克里斯托
Now, the connection between Christo

270
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,390
和艾比・莎保之间的关联变得更加捉摸不透了
and Abbu Shabal is so a little bit fuzzy,

271
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,770
但是如果莫拉莱斯在为艾比・莎保做事的话
But if this was the lead that Morales was working on

272
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,500
也许这是他被绑架的原因 长官?
it could be why she was abducted.Senior?

273
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,190
以上就是莫拉莱斯小姐的资料
All right, this is a personal recovery of Miss Morales.

274
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:48,120
有疑问吗?
All right, who's got questions?

275
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,990
长官 你有敌营里巡逻队人数的
See, Chief. If you have any  update resource, and tell us numbers inside the 

276
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,620
最新数据吗?
camp, what about roving patrols? 

277
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,930
8到10个人左右
Maybe 8 to 10 Bro 

278
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,700
但是我们对巡逻队一无所知
but we don't know anything about roving patrols

279
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,256
所以你只能假设他们布防严密 
you just gonna have to assume 

280
00:19:59,257 --> 00:20:00,900
这些人也是干这行的
that's all working around the squared away you just did for a living too

281
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,220
长官 我们需要搜寻哪种武器?
Senior, what kind of weapons on target are we looking at?

282
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:07,220
重型武器 这些家伙是毒贩
Heavy weapons. This guys are narco traffickers,

283
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,958
比如说M2HB这样的
They can have a M2HB 

284
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:11,740
0.5英寸口径的重型机枪 猜不准
for the course out there,we don't know.

285
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,570
所以 如果装的下 我建议你们带上火箭筒
So, if there is a weapons in place out there, I suggest you guys bring rockets

286
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,525
当然 可别把火箭弹当子弹玩 
of course rockets and bullets don't match,

287
00:20:16,526 --> 00:20:19,040
尽量保证一击必杀 好了 还有疑问吗?
so make sure you got a clear shot.All right, what else?

288
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,490
有没有情报说她的伤势如何?
Any idea wether she's ambulatory or not?

289
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,750
案发现场有很多血迹
There's ton of blood on the scene, 

290
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,310
不过大部分都是罗斯的
and alot of it was Mr Ross'

291
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,470
我们确信莫拉莱斯小姐也受伤了
We confirmed that Ms. Morales may has blood there too

292
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,310
但是这些家伙都是些野蛮人
But these guys are savages.

293
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,810
你们得做好抬着她
So, you're gonna have to assume that she is..

294
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:33,780
出来的准备  所以带副担架吧
non ambulatory, so you gonna have to bring stuff to carry her out.

295
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,380
两分钟后跳伞
Two minutes to drop

296
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:55,410
上尉 要让我们抓到这人

一定要给他点颜色瞧瞧

你说谁?

The guy that gave you taht fcuked up hair cut

300
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:10,820

Fuck. I'm sorry, this should be the last guy to talk put back in Dominican Mr. Clean

301
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,310

长官 把你的M4步枪给我!

423
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:12,070
长官 快艇那里情况如何?
Sir, what's the status on those boat?

424
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,960
我在撤离中和皮鞭分队失去了联系
I lost Whiplash on the run. 

425
00:38:13,961 --> 00:38:16,480

已经没有心跳了!
I got no pulse!

429
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:24,780
敌方靠近 敌方靠近!

Pick it up, pick it up!

432
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:03,890
阿加伊 把握好方向盘 敌军在后方!
Ajay, do it all right, they're coming at our rear!

7 is around, 1 package. Package is wounded Morales

436
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,390
"内华达"在前面有一个商业区
"The Sierra" has downtown one to the head.

437
00:39:21,391 --> 00:39:22,780
这里汇合点很难办
This will be a hard extract.

438
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:33,265
他妈什么状况?! 
What the fcuk?!

439
00:39:33,266 --> 00:39:36,800

- 米奇 挺住啊 - 我们在哪里了?
- Mikey, hang on Buddy. - Where are we?

444
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:07,580
在去汇合点的路上 现在情况尚佳
On our way to extract. We're good to go

445
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,434
你脸部中枪了 他妈伤的很严重 
You took one on the face man, you harm another fcuker 

446
00:40:09,435 --> 00:40:10,453
我们杀了他没? 
Do we get it? 

447
00:40:10,454 --> 00:40:12,490
死了 我杀的 我们在去汇合点的路上
Yes,Oh, I get it ,on our way to extract

448
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:13,780
阿加伊 冲啊 冲啊!
Ajay, splash it, splash it!

449
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:17,060
入水!准备入水 入水!
Water! water, water!

450
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:25,590
我来背她 我来背她!
I got her, I got her!

451
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,440
这并非毫无意义
It wasn't for nothing

452
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:13,210
乌克兰
UKRAINE

453
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,010
你是谁?
Who are you?

454
00:43:55,750 --> 00:44:03,010
- 是门德尔松吗? - 不 是布拉姆斯
- Is it Mendelsson? - No, Brahms.

455
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:09,360
我是克里莫夫 你一定是莎保了
I am Kerimov. You must be Shabal.

456
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:15,033
好吧 就如我在电话里与克里斯托所说 
Ok, as I said to Christo on the phone, 

457
00:44:15,034 --> 00:44:16,360
我能满足你的需求
I have the requirement you want

458
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:19,360
就一件背心
a vest

459
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:23,583
很酷 不是吗? 
Cool isn't it? 

460
00:44:23,584 --> 00:44:26,750
它看起来普通 但却藏货的好地方
It is simple but effective

461
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,360
过来看
over here

462
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:33,360
在背心里塞满了瓷制小球
Inside them is tiny balls made of ceramics-based.

463
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:36,360
每件背心大约能装五百颗
Five hundred of them woven into vest,

464
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:40,360
小球里放了烈性炸药
They contain explosive gel

465
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:44,360
这是我们研发的新技术
It is our new technology 

466
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:48,360
很具毁灭性哦
It is truly devastating,

467
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:50,360
请看
please

468
00:44:56,050 --> 00:44:57,760
不会有问题的
Here is no big deal, you know this

469
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:02,360
这是专为户外活动设计
It is designed for open spaces

470
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:05,360
相信我
You have to believe me

471
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:12,360
这世上鲜有一人专用的武器
There are few weapons in the world that they can operated only by one man

472
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:16,360
看看这个
Look at this.

473
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:27,360
它们能躲开任何安检设备的探测
They can go everywhere without get detected

474
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:32,360
你可以穿着它任游白宫
You could take tour to White House or wherever you like

475
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:36,360
我能看看演示吗?
Can I see a demonstration?

476
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:41,360
你开玩笑吧 这会直接送你上西天的
You kidding, you even have no time to go to Siberia

477
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:46,360
听着 这货要是一爆炸 就直接粉身碎骨了
Listen, when this explodes, there is no safe place.

478
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:49,453
想象一下五百颗子
Imagine firing 500 bullets 

479
00:45:49,454 --> 00:45:53,360
弹瞬间向四面八方扫射的效果
everywhere and being scattered by a massive explosion.

480
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:57,860
穿着它上台 去赌场或是逛商场
Take one of these to the stage, casino or shopping center

481
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:12,360
借助美国大众媒体的力量来制造一场大恐慌吧
and create such a massal panic through American mass media.

482
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:29,510
老兄 看看你 还是没变呐
Buddy, look, you're never change

483
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:32,690
- 要我给他拿外套吗? - 不用 谢谢
- Can I take his coat? - No, thank you 

484
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:38,970
我一直想见见我的故友
And now from time to time, I get to see my old friends by my old life.

485
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,380
但总是失望而归
And it's always, always disappointing.

486
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:48,890
要么变成了混蛋 要么变成了无趣之人
Some become asshole, as other boring

487
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:52,560
简直不敢相信那些年里 我和他们打得火热
And I can't believe I tried to get them in bed all those years ago

488
00:46:55,590 --> 00:47:01,300
嘿 而你 尤里 你却没让我失望
Hey, it is nice not to be disappointed Yuri

489
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:06,460
我不叫尤里
It's not my name

490
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:10,216
我知道 你叫穆罕穆德・艾比・莎保 
I know. Muhammad Abu Shabal, 

491
00:47:10,217 --> 00:47:11,100
莎保之子
the son of Shabal

492
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:14,870
拜托 但你爸爸叫尤金
Come on, your father's name is Yevgeny

493
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:21,090
- 事非当年了 - 是啊 时过境迁
- It's changed. - Yeah, I think it's changed

494
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:24,110
所以时隔多年才和你再次相见
That's why this is the last time I might have to see each other for quite some time. 

495
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:29,110
因为我一直隐姓埋名的活着
For am I have to find a hole to hide in.

496
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:31,580
我不懂你为什么要这么做
I don't understand

497
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:37,340
我被中情局盯上了 摆脱不掉他们的监视
I'm being watched by the CIA, and not there gonna be any chances

498
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:39,080
不言而喻
This is the most oppotunities present itself

499
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:39,764
我只能举家南迁 
I'm taking my family South. 

500
00:47:39,765 --> 00:47:41,220
我需要帮助 需要一个有足够实力的人
I need the help, the energy,

501
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:43,060
或是愿意和那些美国人战到底的人帮我
or the will to fight the Americans

502
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:46,930
阿戴尔和米歇尔怎么了  
What about Ardile and Michel

503
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:50,340
我费尽心血的
I have devoted much of my respect..

504
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:52,600
交易依旧成立 尤里 我说我会提前退休
The deal stands, Yuri.Just because I've taken early retirement,  

505
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:56,480
可没说在这期间一直可以讨价还价
does not mean I'm not holding at my end into the bargain

506
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,480
还有很多事没解决呢
There is so much to be done.

507
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:58,440
会解决的 没有我也行!
And it will be, just without me!

508
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:01,450
你可以拿我的名声和别人合作
You have to use my trust in associates

509
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:03,380
- 这对我不利! - 喂!
- It's not so good for me! - Hey!

510
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:11,090
闭嘴!给我闭嘴!你就会胡说八道!
Hey, shut up! Shut up! Stop! You're fcuking bullshit!

511
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:13,630
- 你不能这么改革! - 换汤不换药而已
- You can't change it like that! - Nothing changes, nothing.

512
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:15,310
你刚刚说什么都变了 但是实质却没变?
You just told me everything change, 

513
00:48:15,311 --> 00:48:16,430
什么意思? 什么意思?
but what is it? What is that?

514
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:21,720
你知道我怎么费劲心思到这里的吗?
Do you know, what I do to get here?

515
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,430
你懂吗?
Do you have any idea?

516
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:25,374
你不知道 你个垃圾 
No, you shit, 

517
00:48:25,375 --> 00:48:27,540
躲在象牙塔里享乐 没心没肺的活
you live up here, this ivory tower, you are really don't care！

518
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:44,550
美国理查德军舰 - 中美洲海岸
USS BON HOMME RICHARD - CENTRAL AMERICAN COAST

519
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:49,320
嗨 长官 米奇情况如何? 
Hey Chief, what's the status of Mikey? 

520
00:48:49,321 --> 00:48:52,550
眼睛保不住了 但是还在坚强的挺着
He's definitely lose the eye, but he's hang it tough.

521
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:57,020
我正在看这个
Yeah, I'm gonna get read into this

522
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:59,740
干得好 教训了这帮混蛋 救回了莫拉莱斯
Great job, small check in those assholes, get Morales back

523
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:01,047
对米奇来说这会是个教训 
It's a blunt deal for Mikey better get 

524
00:49:01,048 --> 00:49:02,790
同时也给你们上了一课如何扎实工作
to tell you what was the solid work.

525
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:04,572
长官 把这话传达下去
So Chief, make sure you get that down of the boys right away. 

526
00:49:04,573 --> 00:49:05,910
- 懂不? - 遵命
- Do you hear me? - Sure

527
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:08,360
好的 还有就是莫拉莱斯
All right. And Morales.

528
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,180
莫拉莱斯就比较难搞了
Morales was one tough chick. 

529
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:12,297
在事情变得难以想象前 
But she should've got in this stuff up to change a lot faster 

530
00:49:12,298 --> 00:49:14,800
她得尽快恢复帮我们理清线索
because this thing is way bigger than we thought it was.

531
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,845
怎么会变这样? 
How was that? 

532
00:49:15,846 --> 00:49:18,330
我本以为就是一场切断武器供应的行动而已
I thought this was cut and dry arm search recovery

533
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,790
本来是这样 直到破解了那个手机的内容
Yeah, wasn't until we got into that phone 

534
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,840
那只你们从那个鬼地方捡来的手机
that you guys picked up at that shit hole.

535
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,332
想来总觉得事情有些不对劲
It turn me out of something just not look right at all.

536
00:49:24,333 --> 00:49:25,600
觉得什么不对劲?
And what's not right about it?

537
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,610
克里斯托和莎保比我想象的还要密切
Christo and Shabal are a lot closer than I thought they were. 

538
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:30,820
莎保是核心人物
Shabal is a wild core man

539
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:32,374
他是个老圣战主义者 
He's an old jahadi, 

540
00:49:32,375 --> 00:49:34,550
对金钱和毒品交易从不掉以轻心
that couldn't give a rest-ass about money or drugs.

541
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:36,850
所以他的朋友克里斯托也是如此 那个毒贩?
Yeah, that tells his friend Christo, the dope dealer?

542
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:38,970
他不是毒贩
He's not a dealer man,

543
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:40,350
他是个走私贩
he's a smugler.

544
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:42,490
这在玩我吧
You've gotta be kidding me.

545
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:45,990
我也被耍了 莎保想杀美国人 
that is exactly what I'm thinking.

546
00:49:45,991 --> 00:49:48,990
克里斯托知道如何走私入境
Shabal wants to kill Americans, Christo knows how to get fcukers inside America.

547
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:51,870
大麻烦要降临了兄弟们 
This could be big trouble in little timing fellas.

548
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:54,490
他们想要袭击美国本土
They're gonna hit us at home.

549
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:56,413
我刚刚和头谈了此事 
I just got done talking to boss, 

550
00:49:56,414 --> 00:49:59,490
特遣部队的工作部署马上会着手开始
on the spec of task force, this is gonna go down.

551
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:00,539
让阿加伊和雷待命 
I need Ajay and Ray stand by

552
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:01,823
在两小时内随时准备出发
 to launch for NSR in 2 hours.

553
00:50:01,824 --> 00:50:03,268
看来他们是要在去非洲的路上
They gonna get some frigging flower mouse

554
00:50:03,269 --> 00:50:04,490
拦截些花鼠之类的东西了
 on the way to Africa.

555
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:05,810
为什么去非洲
Why Africa?

556
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:08,310
在手机的资料里发现那里有个机场
We pended airfield there by the phone that you got?

557
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:11,810
我觉得莎保在西行进行武器交易时会路经那里
And I think that Shabal is gonna be there during weapon transfer on his way West.

558
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:13,810
你说的西行是指去哪里?
When you say "West", what do we talking about?

559
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:15,160
墨西哥西部?
Mexico West?

560
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:16,140
是的
Yeah

561
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:17,250
墨西哥西部
Mexico West

562
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:19,500
这是最坏的情况
It's the worst case scenario

563
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,740
你俩还有其余的人都留在这里
You two and the rest of platoon are gonna stay here

564
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:23,244
待命 如果情况恶化 
and  standby, you'll be the primary assault

565
00:50:23,245 --> 00:50:25,500
危机逼近本土 你们会是先发部队
 for worst case that goes down anywhere near America

566
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:26,200
遵命
Check

567
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:26,700
遵命
Check

568
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,440
他们现身时你会在这里吗?
You gonna be around for any questions as they came up? 

569
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:34,020
不行 克里斯托给我摆了一道 然后消失了
No man. Christo, he put a Roman Polanski at my ass and disappeared.

570
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:36,270
所以我得去和海豹四队取得联络
So I'm gonna link up for SEAL Team 4

571
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:38,630
我们要去南太平洋把他打个落花流水
and we're gonna go hunt his ass down in the South Pacific

572
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:41,120
所以说 我可能脱不开身
So straight up, my ties and palm trees so maybe...

573
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,500
放心吧 兄弟 我们会抓到他的
Yeah brother, I go get them

574
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,670
保重 一切顺利
Be cool. take it easy

575
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:45,770
恭喜你当爸爸了 上尉
Good luck with that baby, Lieutenant

576
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:48,310
所有人都知道了?
Does everybody know?

577
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:50,520
要员们都知道了
All the important people

578
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,840
谁家要员?
The important people to who?

579
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,680
你?
For you?

580
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:53,450
估计是
I guess so

581
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:57,230
我要去看看那帮小子了
I'm gonna go brood the boys

582
00:50:57,230 --> 00:50:58,450
嗨 等下
Hey hold on one second

583
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:02,550
我带了这个想要你提前看一下
I brought it here cause I want you to read it before

584
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,400
我是个值得信任的长官
I'm trusted officer...

585
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:07,150
但是老实说
and but to be honest with you

586
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:09,790
我曾考虑打报告
I was thinking to calling the commander

587
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:11,320
让你回家
trying to get you home

588
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,600
但是事情愈演愈烈
And now worse picked up so much

589
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:16,310
觉得你非在不可了
I feel like we really need you here

590
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:19,130
你还记得我们在阿拉玛最后一次巡航吗?
You remember our last cruise on Alamar?

591
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:19,870
记得
Yeah

592
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:23,450
当最后要完成任务的时候 你说我可以走了
When you got that final turn over op you said I don't need to be there

593
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,880
我当时躺在床上 一心只想着回家
I was lying in bed, and I realized all the thing I need do now was go home

594
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:30,030
但是要是那时候有个万一
But if something went south in your op

595
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:32,240
我绝对会终身抱憾
I would always regret not being there with you

596
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,990
我很感激你一直以来的照顾 戴夫
I appreciate you're taking care of me big time, Dave

597
00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:37,060
不过有时我也还是会厚皮脸的偷懒
But I'm working sometimes with the brass

598
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:38,460
要是可以
If I can 

599
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:39,400
事情慢慢好转
And things slow down

600
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,070
我就给自己放个两周假
I'm gonna get 2 weeks off

601
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:43,330
要是可以我也会
I'll leave the works now eitherway, 

602
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:44,190
真的
I really do

603
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:44,950
但要是不行
But if it doesn't

604
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:51,090
我就只能把这信折成纸飞机送出去了
I'm gonna take this piece of paper and I'll make it into nice paper airplane

605
00:51:51,370 --> 00:51:52,230
尽力吧
Bid it

606
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:15,850
非洲海岸
AFRICAN COAST

607
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:47,970
很好 
Good, we're good

608
00:52:57,330 --> 00:53:00,098
601 浮出水面160尺
601, emerge the ship at 160 feet

609
00:53:00,099 --> 00:53:01,680
出发 出发

610
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:29,760
兄弟们 谢谢你们迅速赶到
Hey guys thank you for being here so fast

611
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:30,650
请坐

612
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:31,480
谢谢
Thank you

你们会有斗牛犬分队的空中支援
You have Bulldog overhead

614
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:35,490
我们掩护你潜入 
We need you te get in, grab the intel

615
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:37,050
把情报带回来
and down to back to us

616
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:38,760
有问题吗?
Do you have any questions?

617
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:39,420
长官 我有疑问
Sir, I have a question

618
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:42,070
我们已设定了汇合时间
We have the rally point time

619
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:43,590
要是他们没按计划出现
What if the meeting doesn't take place as schedule

620
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:45,730
我们需要盯梢多久?
How long do you want us to stay on target?

621
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:46,900
问得好
That's one counts

622
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:49,860
所以待会儿我会制定后备B计划
So, I plan on B out there for a while

623
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:51,150
遵命

624
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:52,150
没问题了吧?
Are we good?

625
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:53,220
没问题了 长官 是的长官
Think so Sir. Yes Sir.

Hey Ray, we got two birds down here in the field

641
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:25,330

是啊
Yeah

为什么问这个?
Why, what's up?

菲律宾人?
Filipinos?

652
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:55,440
菲律宾人不会这么瘦骨嶙峋的
Filipinos definitely not skinnies

653
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,820
他们在给谁做祷告呢?
Who pick up the praying?

654
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:58,890

And enter through two different border crossings

660
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:17,060

768
01:03:31,302 --> 01:03:32,213
从我步入那个门开始 
Since I walk through that door, 

769
01:03:32,655 --> 01:03:34,923
你就不是当初那个有钱人了 不是了
you're not the same guy you used to be. You just not.

770
01:03:36,048 --> 01:03:37,216
这些我无能为力
There's nothing I can do to stop that

771
01:03:37,737 --> 01:03:38,609
我也帮不了你
Nothing I can do to help you right now

772
01:03:39,417 --> 01:03:39,945
除非你愿意
unless you let me help you

773
01:03:40,999 --> 01:03:42,842
我们可以一起合作 兄弟 我和你
We need to do this together pal, you and me

774
01:03:44,439 --> 01:03:47,128
你和这群圣战主义者合作感觉如何?
So, how is you think you working with these jihadi folks then?

775
01:03:49,789 --> 01:03:50,445
你是犹太人 对不?
Your're Jewish, right?

776
01:03:53,291 --> 01:03:56,524
莎保是...什么?
Shabal is ...what?

777
01:03:56,580 --> 01:03:59,420
你有发小吗?
Have you ever had a friend that you grew up with?

778
01:03:59,950 --> 01:04:02,080
- 什么? - 你有发小吗?
- Sorry? - Have you ever had a friend that you grew up with?

779
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:03,635
有 - 有共同的兴趣爱好 
Yes - like play interest, 

780
01:04:03,636 --> 01:04:04,210
像足球之类的

01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:05,568
或者你们都玩些什么 
Or what would you play,

782
01:04:05,569 --> 01:04:06,700
- 棒球吗? - 差不多
- base ball probably, right? - probably

783
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:10,760
然后大家各奔东西 几年后又重新相遇
And anyone has his separate ways, and some years later you meet up

784
01:04:12,050 --> 01:04:14,600
但是你完全没有认出他
And you totally didn't recognize the person

785
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,880
这就是我和莎保
That's what I have been with Shabal

786
01:04:17,970 --> 01:04:20,630
我们有共同的爱好
We share a common interest

787
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:24,020
所以他有些与众不同的念头
So, he came up with his incredible idea

788
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:26,010
来自于他的信仰
because of his beliefs

789
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:27,650
我不需要被他同化
I don't necessarily share his beliefs

790
01:04:27,650 --> 01:04:29,440
但他是个聪明人
But he's a smart guy

791
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:30,390
你知道吗?
You know?

792
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:32,080
就像
Almost like ...

793

01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:42,450
而那是莎保

796
01:04:42,450 --> 01:04:43,270
是吗?
Is it?

797
01:04:43,270 --> 01:04:44,830
美国人就是中间者
And America is in between

01:04:45,610 --> 01:04:47,090
就是这样
Yeah 

800

- 这个? - 是的
- Right here? - Yes

802
01:04:52,770 --> 01:04:54,860
你把这个当做一场游戏吗?
You think this is some kind of game?

803
01:04:57,773 --> 01:04:59,524
是吗?你觉得这么做挺好玩?
Do you? You find this amusing? 

804

810
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:21,790
和我的妻子和孩子
to my wife and to my child

811
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,230
其他一律免谈
and nobody else

812
01:05:25,290 --> 01:05:26,520
赶时间办事吗?
Running late somewhere?

813
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:28,160
06:04
6 after 4

814
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:28,660

815
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:29,528
是的
Yeah

816
01:05:30,045 --> 01:05:31,800
然后 问题是 兄弟
So ... Here's the problem pal

817
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:34,570
你爱你的家人 是吧?
You do love your family don't you?

818
01:05:35,630 --> 01:05:36,570
是的

820
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:39,320
我女儿怎么了?

821
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:41,160
你想见她吗?
Are you looking forward to seeing her again?

822
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:43,300
每时每刻都在想她
Every minute on my life

823
01:06:06,110 --> 01:06:09,160
我给你看这些 是想让你考虑清楚
I wanted you to see that,  so you can think about something

824
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,580
一些事情
very seriously

825
01:06:10,910 --> 01:06:13,350
因为你的余生可能会在某个牢房里度过
Because you're gonna be sitting in a box somewhere

826
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:16,950
得到妥善和人道的待遇
You'll be treated properly and humanely

827
01:06:18,530 --> 01:06:22,910
这孩子会长大成人 成家立业
That girl is gonna grow up, and she's gonna get married

828
01:06:23,590 --> 01:06:25,820
而你的妻子则会另觅良人
and your wife is gonna find someone else

829
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:29,180
你会失去一切
And you're gonna miss everything

830
01:06:36,730 --> 01:06:38,190
要是我做了一些
If I had done something

831
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,450
危及家庭的事情
that would endanger my family

832
01:06:40,450 --> 01:06:42,400
我会像你一样感同深受
I would feel just like you do right now

833
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:47,300
你能保证不动我家人吗?
Do you promise not to touch my family?

834
01:06:47,490 --> 01:06:48,790
我永远不会动你的家人
I would never touch your family

835
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,170
永远不会
I would not

840
01:07:09,810 --> 01:07:11,243
瓷质球体炸弹的自爆背心
filled with ceramic bullbearings

841
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:13,480
可以逃脱任何金属探测器的检测
Slipping by every metal detector

842
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:15,180
通过美国所有检查站的检查
and every check-point in your country.

843
01:07:17,590 --> 01:07:19,370
你觉得你们国家的经济会因此萧条吗?
Do you think your economy's fcuked now?

844
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:23,710
先想想媒体会作何反应
Just think what the Media is gonna do with this

845
01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:29,002
911和这个比起来就黯然失色了
It's gonna make 9/11 look like a fcuking walking park, the Grand Central Park

846
01:07:32,570 --> 01:07:34,190
所以 你说
So, you're telling me ..

849
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:47,190
那他们打算去哪儿?

948
01:20:49,914 --> 01:20:51,077
据说很困难
All the way the tough, from I heard

949
01:20:51,789 --> 01:20:53,242
有些事情你必须明白
There is something that you have to understand

950
01:20:53,380 --> 01:20:55,167
我的上司 他们害怕事态演变成
my superiors, they're very fearful of 

951
01:20:55,168 --> 01:20:56,850
墨版的摩加迪沙事件
Mexican "mogadishu"

952
01:20:56,850 --> 01:20:59,320
他们重点强调了 不要重演黑鹰坠落的悲剧
no black hawk down, that's what they're saying, so

953
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:00,510
我们行动要尽量低调
we do need to stay under the radar

954
01:21:00,510 --> 01:21:02,110
我完全明白 长官
I understand completely Sir.

955
01:21:02,110 --> 01:21:04,640
你的小队能过来支援我感激万分
Your team presence here is greatly appreciated

956
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:06,390
但是时间紧迫 我们得开始行动了
But we're out of time, we need to move

957
01:21:06,390 --> 01:21:07,300
告诉我 我们该去哪儿
Tell me where  we go

958
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:09,313
帮你把信息整理一下 
Help piece these together for me. 

959
01:21:09,314 --> 01:21:11,730
情报表示他们在利用地道网
Our intel says they using a tunnel network,

960
01:21:11,730 --> 01:21:12,820
但在一家牛奶厂房的下面
but it's under a milk factory

961
01:21:12,820 --> 01:21:14,690
这些信息对你有帮助吗?
This mean anything to you?

962
01:21:14,690 --> 01:21:16,710
我知道确切位置
I know exactly where it is

963
01:21:16,710 --> 01:21:17,890
离这里不远
It's not far from here

964
01:21:17,890 --> 01:21:19,780
那就是我们要去的地方
And that's where we going

965
01:21:19,780 --> 01:21:23,410
墨西卡利大概没有比这环境更恶劣的地方了
From all of the places of Mexicali you could have been, this probably the worst

966
01:21:23,410 --> 01:21:25,820
贩毒团伙几乎全方位部署了那个地区
The cartels control any of that from all the angles

967
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:27,823
他们的火力远远胜过我们 
They had us heavily outgunned. 

968
01:21:27,824 --> 01:21:29,660
单是接近目标就很是困难
Simply reaching your target's gonna be very difficult

969
01:21:29,660 --> 01:21:32,550
长官 我们的国家正面临威胁
Sir we have a thorn national's heading to our country 

970
01:21:32,550 --> 01:21:35,040
毋庸置疑 他们可不待见我们
needless to say, they're no big fan of ours

971
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:36,202
要是他们就在那个工厂里
If they are in that factory, 

972
01:21:36,203 --> 01:21:37,260
那就是我们的目的地
that's where we going

973
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:39,730
中尉 我会带你们到你们需要去的任何地方
Lieutenant, I'll take you anywhere you need to go

974
01:21:39,730 --> 01:21:42,700
但你和你的战友们得做好打场恶仗的心理准备
But prepare your men for a bigger fight than you had imagine

975
01:21:42,700 --> 01:21:44,090
你不但要和目标作战
You're not fighting at men

976
01:21:44,090 --> 01:21:46,640
还要和那些保护目标的毒枭们火拼
you're also fighting the cartels that protecting them.

977
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:49,211
要是你们的目标成功进入了地下通道 
If your targets make it into those tunnels

978
01:21:49,212 --> 01:21:50,270
那就无以遁形了
 they'll disappear like ghosts

979
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:35,220
你从这里进入隧道
You enter the tunnels right here

980
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:37,210
走几米后会到达岔口
You walk several miles to this fork

981
01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:39,280
我的人会告诉你走那条路
my men will tell you which way to take

982
01:23:39,810 --> 01:23:41,900
一旦你们到达指定地点
Once you get to this point

983
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:43,410
我的工作就结束了
My job is done

984
01:23:44,260 --> 01:23:45,400
你们就只能靠自己了
You're on your own

985
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:15,810
中尉 我们现在就出发吧
Lieutenant, we're going now 

986
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:17,060
收到
Roger that

987
01:24:40,020 --> 01:24:42,420
长官 不要停下 我们身负重任
Chief, We'll not stopping, we'll rolling up on target hard

988
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:44,540
收到 预计30秒后到达
Roger that, should've there about 30 seconds up

989
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:40,000
屋顶有人!
SA, on the roof!

990
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:52,000
我们得快撤
We gotta go

991
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:53,000
快!
Now!

992
01:26:11,290 --> 01:26:13,370
快 你留在这里
Come on. You stay here

993
01:26:25,770 --> 01:26:26,950
长官 留两个人在这里看守
Sir, leave two men here

994
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:28,510
你们俩 留在这!
You two, stay here!

995
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,010
威米!
Weimy!

996
01:27:02,090 --> 01:27:03,030
威米!
Weimy!

997
01:27:04,340 --> 01:27:05,760
我需要你控制住这该死的家伙的火力
I need you to lock this shit down  

998
01:27:14,290 --> 01:27:15,040
小心!
Watch out!

999
01:27:45,350 --> 01:27:47,287
你们去控制大门
You guys got the gate

1000
01:27:47,934 --> 01:27:48,554
走!
Go!

1001
01:27:48,815 --> 01:27:49,906
去前面!
Go to the front door!

1002
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:52,820
快走!
Go! 

1003
01:28:51,650 --> 01:28:52,400
等一下
One moment

1004
01:28:52,630 --> 01:28:54,500
在这里炸弹引爆
This is where you have to blow the bomb

1005
01:28:56,540 --> 01:28:58,320
怎么了?
What happens?

1006
01:28:58,530 --> 01:29:01,180
你会在天堂和你丈夫重逢的
You will meet your husband in heaven

1007
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:01,290
引爆!
Boooooomb!!!!!!!!!

1008
01:30:54,970 --> 01:30:55,880
妈的 长官
Damn it, sir

1009
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:57,930
真想和家人说说刚刚发生什么了
I could explain that one to my family

1010
01:30:57,930 --> 01:31:00,100
别说  这样就不用解释了
Keep back there, so I won't  have to, huh?

1011
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:17,792
安全
Clear

1012
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:42,270
手榴弹！
Grenaaaaaade!

1013
01:32:47,430 --> 01:32:48,940
长官 我来照顾他
Chief, I got him 

1014
01:33:11,580 --> 01:33:13,590
继续前进 我掩护你
Keep going, I cover you

1015
01:35:00,580 --> 01:35:01,590
长官！
Chief! 

1016
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:14,221
突击二队 这里是突击一队 
Assault 2, this is  Assault 1.

1017
01:35:14,222 --> 01:35:17,200
请注意 隧道安全 危机警报解除
Be advised, tunnel is secure, and all threats are neutralized

1018
01:35:17,630 --> 01:35:20,301
LT和长官战亡 
LT and Chief are down.

1019
01:35:20,302 --> 01:35:23,640
重复 LT和长官战亡
I say it again, LT and Chief are down.

1020
01:36:20,090 --> 01:36:22,090
你父亲是个出色的人
Your father was a good man

1021
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:24,890
没有他的童年是一个遗憾
Growing up without him is gonna be hard,

1022
01:36:24,890 --> 01:36:26,492
会很受伤 
It's gonna hurt. 

1023
01:36:26,493 --> 01:36:28,736
你会感到孤独 
You feel alone, 

1024
01:36:28,737 --> 01:36:31,300
会感觉迷失了方向
out to see with no shore and sight

1025
01:36:45,310 --> 01:36:48,810
但是你要记住 你流着你父亲的一样的血
Remember, you have your father's blood in your veins

1026
01:36:48,810 --> 01:36:50,500
原则造就了你的父亲的人格魅力
The code that make your father who he was

1027
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:53,500
它也会让你成为真正的男子汉
is the same code that'll make you a man

1028
01:36:56,500 --> 01:37:00,000
你父亲的意志和价值观将由你继承
Your father's will, his values live on in you

1029
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:03,500
正如你父亲钟爱的盒子彩绘的人物
Like those people who is in strange painting your father admired

1030
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:06,400
我们的一生会经历很多
We man made of the boxes

1031
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:07,400
法则
chambers of laws

1032
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:09,400
胜利
and triumph

1033
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:10,400
伤痛
and hurt

1034
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:11,400
希望
and hope

1035
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:14,400
还有爱
and love

1036
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:37,250
没人可以比一个
No one's stronger than a man

1037
01:37:37,250 --> 01:37:40,030
驾驭感情和整理过去的人更加强大
who can harness his emotions and his past

1038
01:37:44,350 --> 01:37:47,629
把那些伤痛当做你人生前进的动力
use it as motivation to write 

1039
01:37:47,630 --> 01:37:49,160
去书写新篇章吧
the most important letter of your life

1040
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:04,574
你父亲临死前 
Before he died, 

1041
01:39:04,575 --> 01:39:08,240
让我交给你特库姆塞的这首诗
your father asked me to give you this poem by Tecumseh, a man he greatly admired

1042
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:11,420
我说过我会把它折成纸飞机送出去
I told him I'd fold it into paper airplane

1043
01:39:11,430 --> 01:39:13,650
我想我正在这么做
and I guess that's what I'm doing

1044
01:39:14,090 --> 01:39:16,620
他想借这首诗对你说
Say on it on him, to you

1045
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:23,570
好好生活让不要畏惧死亡
Live your life that the fear of death can never enter your heart

1046
01:39:24,570 --> 01:39:26,180
不可干涉别人的信仰
Trouble no one about his religion

1047
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:29,200
尊重他人和他们的见解

1048
01:39:29,770 --> 01:39:31,490
也希望他们同样尊重你
and demand that they respect yours

1049
01:39:32,470 --> 01:39:33,450
要热爱生命
Love your life..

1050
01:39:34,030 --> 01:39:35,280
诠释生命
Perfect your life..

1051
01:39:35,770 --> 01:39:37,890
以美好看待生命中的一切
beautify all things in your life..

1052
01:39:38,570 --> 01:39:40,450
把有限的生命
Seek to make your life long

1053
01:39:40,710 --> 01:39:42,490
奉献到无限的为人民服务中去
and of service to your people

1054
01:39:43,460 --> 01:39:45,280
当你濒临死亡
When your time comes to die

1055
01:39:45,620 --> 01:39:48,440
不要像那些心怀恐惧的人
Be not like those whose hearts are filled with fear of death

1056
01:39:48,850 --> 01:39:50,685
当他们大限将至 他们哭泣 
So that one their time come, they weep, 

1057
01:39:50,686 --> 01:39:52,380
祈求上天再多给他们点时间
and pray for little more time

1058
01:39:52,380 --> 01:39:55,210
去重复他们平庸的人生
to live their lifes over again and indifferently

1059
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:59,190
你应唱起你死亡之歌 像个英雄回家般的
Sing your death song, and die like a hero

1060
01:39:59,330 --> 01:40:00,900
离去
going home...
