1
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:40,891
MAN: Just before my father died,

2
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:43,019
he said the worst thing about growing old

3
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:44,609
was that it gets harder

4
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:46,814
to protect the things that matter.

5
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:49,356
Honour, freedom, justice and family.

6
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,143
Those things are sacred.

7
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:56,150
You live your life by a code, an ethos.

8
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:57,952
Every man does.

9
00:00:58,517 --> 00:00:59,878
It's your shoreline.

10
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:01,912
It's what guides you home...

11
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:05,202
and trust me, you're always trying to get home.

12
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:16,112
NEWSCASTER: Authorities say the ring

13
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:20,083
is centred in Costa Rica with the primary export being...

14
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:47,935
widely unknown if the war on drugs

15
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,729
is connecting them with...

16
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,552
Teams in the region have been known to retaliate using a...

17
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,148
25,000 troops <i>be...</i>

18
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:24,263
flying from the U.S. to control that region.

19
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:37,986
Can we get some ice cream?

20
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,363
- No, we got to go. - You always say no.

21
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,914
Well, are you gonna buy? No, you buy.

22
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,053
Okay, what are we getting today? Passion fruit.

24
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:48,797
Okay, passion fruit.

25
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:54,541
AMBASSADOR: How about macadamia nut?

26
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:27,868
NEWSCASTER: ..claimed responsibility

27
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:30,079
for the attack at the International School in Manila.

28
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:31,538
MAN: Your father was a reader.

29
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,536
He loved Churchill, Faulkner,

30
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:35,800
and books about other wise men.

31
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,503
He loved artists who painted people

32
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:39,977
with bodies that looked like boxes.

33
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:41,674
I'd give him hell about that.

34
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,488
He'd just say, "You got to look harder."

35
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,145
Ambassador Margulies had long been a strong supporter

36
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,855
of joint counter-terrorism operations

37
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,853
conducted within this region.

38
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,901
Not one group has yet claimed responsibility

39
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,070
for the attacks on the International School.

40
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:04,530
- Here's your coffee, Rorke. - Thank you, ma'am.

41
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:05,864
- How's it going? - Hey.

42
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,284
- You want the usual? - Sounds good, thank you.

43
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:11,307
You're late again, Dave. I didn't say anything.

45
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:15,512
What do you got going on over here?

46
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,749
Are you serious, man?

47
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,548
We're not telling anyone yet.

48
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,300
You a little nervous, though, huh?

49
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:25,884
Last time I checked, they don't come with directions.

50
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,428
Yeah, tell me about it.

51
00:05:27,453 --> 00:05:30,431
- Hey- - Hey- My man here is having a baby.

52
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:31,885
Hey, congratulations.

53
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,611
Hey, everybody, Rorke's having a baby.

54
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:39,866
What did I just say?

55
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:42,943
Ah, don't worry about it, man. You're gonna be awesome.

56
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:45,487
I'm so excited for you, man. You'll be a good dad.

57
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,781
Hey, tomorrow Jackie and I are heading to the beach.

58
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:50,576
Bring Sandy and the kids. I'll bring an board for you.

59
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:52,953
- You know I don't surf. - I know you don't surf,

60
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:55,164
but it'll be good to get the families together.

61
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:57,166
- All right. - Now you've told everyone here,

62
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:59,335
try and contain yourself tomorrow.

63
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,108
<i>L</i> will try.

64
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,348
: "Look harder," your father would say.

65
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:14,183
I always knew he wasn't just talking

66
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,657
about those strange boxy paintings.

67
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,314
Order and chaos throughout the world.

68
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:22,380
One often disguises the other.

69
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:24,670
Hey, I'll be right down, all right?

70
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:26,260
Whatever you say, boss.

71
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:31,041
WOMAN: How was the ride?

72
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,095
MAN: I left Colombia this morning.

73
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,025
Colombia to here in one day?

74
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:36,574
Piece of cake.

75
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,518
Anyway, estimates say that Christo is worth

76
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:41,937
- close to a billion. - That's with a "B"?

77
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,440
Yeah, and he gives back a lot to this community here

78
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:47,609
with medical clinics, schools, political donations,

79
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,278
you name it, so this is the deal:

80
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,697
They are extremely loyal to him over here.

81
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:54,307
When did the DEA hand him over to us?

82
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,493
When they intercepted a 707 of his

83
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,078
filled with Soviet weapons.

84
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,539
Listen, Langley says that the boys over at NSA...

85
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:03,292
they found some interesting intercepts connecting Christo

86
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:06,211
to a jihadist network out of Southeast Asia.

87
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,881
Apparently, Christo and one of the guys running the network...

88
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:10,675
they're childhood friends.

89
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:17,222
DAVE: Your father's grandfather

90
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:20,512
gave up his life flying a B-24 in World War II.

91
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,311
He kept the liberator aloft

92
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:24,104
just long enough for everyone to jump,

93
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,523
and then he went down with the plane.

94
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:29,609
That's the blood that courses in your veins.

95
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:31,472
Daddy, can I come with you?

96
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:34,531
Want to come with me? Did you feel how cold it is out there?

97
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:35,644
I tell you what.

98
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,993
Go hang out with Mommy for a little while, help out

99
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,620
with the baby. When I come back in,

100
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:41,788
if you still want to go out, I'll take you out with me.

101
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:44,398
- Promise? - I promise. Hurry up, go.

102
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,625
What's going on, sir?

103
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,882
What's up, brother? Nothing much, man.

104
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,969
Now, I know you got the New York heritage,

105
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:58,430
but this isn't exactly like sitting back in Staten Island.

106
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,516
You got to actually work hard to get through the surf.

107
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,352
12-plus years on the teams and you don't know how to do this?

108
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,145
Hey, wait till you have five kids, man.

109
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,523
You'll see how much time you got to play in the surf.

110
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:09,316
You ready to get in the drink or what?

111
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:10,776
Okay, man, lead the way.

112
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,528
- All right, don't embarrass us. - All right.

113
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:15,818
: Your father was my boss, and I was his chief.

114
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,769
We'd saved each other's lives more than once.

115
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:23,972
There was a brotherhood between us, and we depended

116
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,507
on each other more than family.

117
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:31,874
A wise man once said,

118
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,479
"Although a single twig will break,

119
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,881
a bundle of twigs is strong."

120
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,358
Okay, okay, gracias. Wow, this is unbelievable.

122
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:53,068
I still can't believe you ordered Chinese in this place.

123
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,249
It's really good.

124
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,577
Double word score, 18 points.

125
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:08,775
Dumb?

126
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,826
Read it and weep, sugar.

127
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:14,614
Hmm.

128
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:16,662
I'll try not to.

129
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:19,413
Look at this, look at this.

130
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:20,901
38 points for me.

131
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,099
Adumbrating... that's not even a word.

132
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,226
Okay, first of all, it's pronounced "adumbrating,"

133
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,972
and it means pretending, foreshadowing.

134
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:34,286
Hmm, guess who's buying dinner tonight, sugar.

135
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:39,055
Fine.

136
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:44,129
In most cases, officers get tactical partners.

137
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:47,789
Langley sets me up with some sort of Scrabble hustler.

138
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,283
Scrabble Yoda, okay? Get it right.

139
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:56,447
- How much do I owe you? - Nada. - Shit.

140
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:45,340
DAVE: Our platoon was headed downrange.

141
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:48,794
Weimy... he was our sniper.

142
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,894
Ten years ago he worked nights

143
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,313
stocking shelves at a grocery store.

144
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:54,856
Now he's another watchman

145
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,275
standing guard while the world sleeps.

146
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,341
He was a husband and a father.

147
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:02,002
Ray... our comms guy, our radioman.

148
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:05,578
He grew up in East L.A. gangland.

149
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:08,662
He had a Silver Star for pulling a wounded teammate

150
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:09,775
out of the fray.

151
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,657
Sonny... he was made of granite.

152
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,585
This guy didn't even do push-ups

153
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,046
'cause he was afraid his chest was gonna get too big.

154
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,724
Ajay joined the teams late in his 30s.

155
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,885
He'd been a Muay Thai fighter early in life.

156
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,107
Before that, he grew up dirt poor in Trinidad.

157
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,202
Mikey had 20 years in the teams.

158
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,770
But as humble as he was, you'd never even know it.

159
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:36,606
He kept a picture of his wife in his helmet

160
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,650
and a lock of her hair in his pocket.

161
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,036
Quiet as the breeze.

162
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,363
And finally, Senior Chief.

163
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:46,616
I couldn't really tell you much about him,

164
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:49,077
other than I'd rather take a knife into a gunfight

165
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,619
than have to be interrogated by him.

166
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,032
That last night at home,

167
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,628
you'd think about how you could have been a better dad,

168
00:12:58,653 --> 00:12:59,809
a better husband.

169
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:01,673
That bedtime story you should have read

170
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,807
or that anniversary you forgot.

171
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,635
You don't expect your family

172
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,179
to understand what you're doing.

173
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:08,764
You just hope they'll understand

174
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,474
you're doing it for them.

175
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:12,517
When you get home, you hope you can pick up

176
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,243
right where you left off.

177
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,147
- Yo, what's up, Chief? - That boy is so, so awesome.

178
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,024
What, you putting the wild bunch down?

179
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:20,137
Hey, uh, Senior,

180
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,068
you mind giving us a couple minutes, man?

181
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:24,542
- Nah, you got 'em, jefe. - Thanks.

182
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:28,700
RORKE: Fellas, you know I only got so many speeches

183
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:31,786
in a given work-up or deployment, but, uh...

184
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,288
it's like Chief and I said

185
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,916
right at the beginning of this platoon.

186
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:37,626
Once we step off on campaign,

187
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,628
once this bird's ready and we're downrange,

188
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:40,962
everything back home needs to be in balance.

189
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,255
We're not gonna be worth a damn

190
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,757
to each other or ourselves if we get

191
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,425
over there and something's out of whack.

192
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,427
I mean, if things aren't right with the family,

193
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,638
things aren't right with the finances, or something's off,

194
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,223
it's gonna put us all out of balance,

195
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:53,225
so we need to have that tight before we launch.

196
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,893
If somebody/s got an issue, bring it up.

197
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:57,437
Chief can take care of it, I can take care of it.

198
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,481
Everybody's got each other's back. Let's make sure

199
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,983
we lock that down so when we're ready to roll,

200
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,253
all our focus is on the mission.

201
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,740
For all those who have been downrange...

202
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:11,282
to us and those like us... damn few.

203
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,325
- ALL: Cheers. - Hear, hear.

204
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:19,179
I still like the name James.

205
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:22,416
I'll think about it, if it's a boy. Come here.

207
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:32,652
I'm proud of you.

208
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:34,632
Thanks, baby.

209
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,298
Hey, little one,

210
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,982
you make sure you keep Mama away from Aunt Carol.

211
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:44,150
I don't like that chain-smoking at all.

212
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:45,604
I got it, Lieutenant.

213
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,320
- Okay. - It's gonna be okay.

214
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,726
- All right. - It's gonna be fine.

215
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:57,330
Try to keep this as long as you can

216
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,833
- for a while, yeah? - Anything else, Commander?

217
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:03,191
Yeah, I'd like to be able to look into your eyes

218
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,130
when our first child is born.

219
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:06,856
You know I'll do my best.

220
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:14,319
I love you, baby.

221
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:20,782
Love you.

222
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:29,036
DAVE: War is a country of will.

223
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,220
There is no room for sympathy.

224
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:34,200
If you're not willing to give up everything,

225
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:35,586
you've already lost.

226
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,276
CHRISTO: What is it about you Americans that makes

227
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:11,906
you feel entitled to fuck with how I make my living?

228
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:27,629
I know who you are, Miss Morales, and who you work for.

229
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:30,048
: So why don't you save us both some time

230
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:33,134
and tell me exactly what you think you know?

231
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,348
: How did that feel, Miss Morales?

232
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,250
Have a great day at the spa.

233
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:07,569
HENCHMAN: Si, jefe.

234
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,153
- Hey, fellas, what's up? - Hey.

235
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:34,738
It's hotter than two rats

236
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:36,781
screwing in a wool sock out there, yeah?

237
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,742
Africa-hot... Tarzan couldn't take this heat.

238
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:40,952
Anyway, here's the deal. Time to get your frogman on.

239
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,542
Lights. Three days ago,

240
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,790
two CIA agents... a Walter Ross and a Miss Lisa Morales...

241
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,792
were ambushed inside their hotel room

242
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:49,627
here in Costa Rica by a unknown amount

243
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,421
of heavily-armed assholes.

244
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,548
Unfortunately, Mr. Ross was murdered

245
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,925
and Miss Morales has been abducted.

246
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,635
We believe that this has been the work

247
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,857
of a guy named Mikail Troikowicz, aka Christo.

248
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:02,974
LT's going to give you the skinny on him.

249
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:04,019
Thanks, Senior.

250
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:06,443
Mikail Troikowicz, aka Christo.

251
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:08,480
This guy is believed to have been working

252
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:10,857
cocaine-for-weapons deals between the Russian Mafia,

253
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:13,234
the FARC guerrillas, and the Mexican drug cartels

254
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,028
ever since the late 1990s.

255
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:17,322
Now, before she was captured,

256
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:18,782
Morales was working a possible link

257
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:22,140
between our boy Christo and this guy Abu Shabal.

258
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:25,080
Glory to Allah, Lord of the world

259
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:26,664
who has created us as Muslims

260
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:30,226
and delivered us with the jihad on his direct path.

261
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:32,962
Peace be upon those who follow his direct path

262
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,552
to the Day of Judgment.

263
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,908
Let me explain this to you Americans.

264
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:39,766
We are not separatists.

265
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,113
We Chechens are not a legal part of anyone,

266
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,308
but you Americans are willingly

267
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,966
or unwillingly assisting

268
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:49,100
in the genocide of our people

269
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:52,600
by demanding that we obey certain rules

270
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:55,086
and by your continued occupation

271
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,809
of all Muslim countries.

272
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:59,020
With the grace of Allah,

273
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:01,059
glorious and exulted is he,

274
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:04,656
America will never be safe until safety becomes

275
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:06,384
a reality for us.

276
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:08,281
Allahu Akbar.

277
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,167
LT: Abu Shabal is a Chechen terrorist

278
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:12,689
who is associated with

279
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:15,004
the Beslan School Massacre. He's been jumping

280
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,840
between training camps in Indonesia

281
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:18,226
and the Philippines.

282
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:20,802
Now, the connection between Christo and Abu Shabal

283
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,303
is still a little bit fuzzy,

284
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,764
but if this was the lead that Morales was working on,

285
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,933
it could be why she was abducted.

286
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,352
- Senior? - This is a personnel recovery

287
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:30,465
of Miss Morales.

288
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:33,363
All right, who's got questions?

289
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:35,775
Senior Chief, you got any, uh, updated source intel

290
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,611
on numbers inside the camp, and what about roving patrols?

291
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:40,655
Maybe eight to ten, bro, but we don't know anything

292
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,532
about roving patrols. You just have to assume

293
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:44,033
they're out there walking around or squared away.

294
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:45,785
They do this for a living, too.

295
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,787
Senior, what kind of weapons- on-target are we looking at?

296
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:48,764
Heavy weapons.

297
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:50,582
These guys are narco-traffickers,

298
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:52,625
so they can have anything from Soviet-bloc DShKs.

299
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,420
They could have M2HP, .50-cals out there, we don't know,

300
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:57,255
so if there is a weapon supplacement up there,

301
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,048
I suggest you guys bring rockets.

302
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:00,675
Of course, rockets and foliage don't match,

303
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,802
so make sure you got a clear shot.

304
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,256
All right, what else?

305
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,598
Any idea whether she's ambulatory or not?

306
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:08,224
There was a ton of blood on the scene

307
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,685
and a lot of it was Mr. Ross'... we confirmed that.

308
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,103
Miss Morales may have blood there, too,

309
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,965
but these guys are savages,

310
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:16,566
so you have to assume she is non-ambulatory,

311
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:19,652
so you have to bring stuff to carry her out.

312
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,381
MAN: Two minutes to drop.

313
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:36,654
Hey, LT.

314
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:40,757
You got to let us know who that guy is,

315
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:43,092
so when we get back, we can kick his ass.

316
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:43,729
What guy?

317
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:48,248
The guy that gave you that fucked-up haircut.

318
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:50,082
Fuck.

319
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,019
RAY: Damn, Sonny, you should be the last guy to talk.

320
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:55,271
You look like the Dominican Mr. Clean.

321
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:56,940
SONNY: That means my head shines

322
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:58,483
like your gold teeth, huh?

323
00:20:58,508 --> 00:21:00,277
RAY: Don't be like that...

324
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:01,135
Ramp!

325
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,700
RORKE: Mask up.

326
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:09,071
Man, I tell you what.

327
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,162
The only thing better than this right here

328
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,207
is being a dad,

329
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:15,500
except for that whole changing diaper thing,

330
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:17,794
but Sandy does that for me anyways, so...

331
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:20,268
I'm actually looking forward to it.

332
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:23,646
MAN: Blackbeard green light in ten.

333
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:28,662
Five.

334
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:03,459
Blackbeard Main, Blackbeard Main,

335
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:06,335
this is Blackbeard Actual. Radio check. Over.

337
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,094
Blackbeard Main, Blackbeard Main,

338
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:15,204
this is Blackbeard Actual. Over.

339
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:20,017
: Roger, Actual. This is Main.

340
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,743
We have you Lima Charlie.

341
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:23,194
Roger, Main.

342
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,667
All boots are on the ground. I pass T-bird.

343
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:30,297
Any traffic for my station at this time?

344
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:33,656
Actual, imagery picked up an increase in traffic

345
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:36,810
at secondary location, known to be enemy QRF,

346
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:38,327
eight clicks from primary target.

347
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:39,871
The swift boats will insert

348
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:42,494
at 0600 for your extract. Out. Copy.

349
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:44,173
Roger, Main.

350
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:54,339
You ready?

351
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:57,083
Roger that, sir.

352
00:24:57,538 --> 00:24:59,647
We got about 4.7 clicks at 355.

353
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:03,234
Take it out.

354
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:33,913
BLACKBEARD MAIN: Whiplash, one minute out.

355
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:46,073
BLACKBEARD MAIN: 3O seconds.

356
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:49,546
Ten by ten.

357
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:54,050
BLACKBEARD MAIN: Whiplash, go.

358
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:05,926
WHIPLASH: All boots on deck.

359
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:20,575
WHIPLASH: Line secure.

360
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:30,064
BLACKBEARD MAIN: Whiplash,

361
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,926
Bucket One and Two are out.

362
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:13,313
Whiplash, this is Blackbeard. Radio check. Over.

364
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:16,485
Blackbeard, Whiplash. Have you loud and clear.

366
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,075
Standing by on the set.

367
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:19,600
Roger, Whiplash.

368
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:22,268
What is your ETA to my pos?

369
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:24,081
WHIPLASH: ETA 20 mikes.

370
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:26,495
Be advised, Raven is in flight and pushing

371
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,676
to your location.

372
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:51,768
<i>No mas, pot favor.</i>

373
00:27:58,678 --> 00:27:59,178
No!

374
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:00,971
No!

375
00:28:03,683 --> 00:28:05,248
Hey, sir, we got to go.

376
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:14,527
Roger. Take it out.

377
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:16,712
I feel like we're pretty thin.

378
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:18,214
I'd like to take you guys with us.

379
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:20,132
Chief, I got a SBT coming up on-step.

380
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:22,134
I got a Raven pushing my pause.

381
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,345
Weimy and I are in good watch position, and I got

382
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,763
to keep reporting back to Blackbeard Main.

383
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:28,237
- We're staying here. - Roger that.

384
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:41,463
Keep it tight.

385
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:42,679
Got it.

386
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:12,597
Whiplash, this is Blackbeard.

387
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:15,104
Assault force is moving to the target early.

388
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:17,238
Request immediate fire support.

389
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:20,776
Blackbeard, this is Whiplash. Good copy.

390
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:22,230
Request fire support.

391
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:25,138
Pushing to your location in 15 mikes.

392
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:51,303
Whiplash, this is Blackbeard.

393
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:53,958
I have positive control of the Raven.

394
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:02,736
Chief, are you set?

395
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:22,102
RORKE: Chief, Chief, hold. MAN: Juan!

396
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:24,106
Get back in there.

397
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:27,315
1:00, base of the tower. - Got him.

398
00:31:29,138 --> 00:31:31,383
RORKE: You're clear to the door.

399
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:47,963
I've got two squirters coming out the back door.

400
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:10,475
Going in!

401
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:17,074
- Clear! - All clear!

402
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:21,905
Weimy, 11:00, driver's side, truck.

403
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:24,557
- Got him.

404
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:30,425
- Fuck.

405
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:42,722
- Come on. - DAVE: Go in! Go in!

406
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:46,983
Clear!

407
00:33:47,735 --> 00:33:48,415
All clear!

408
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:50,282
Target's secure.

409
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:53,112
Chief, I'm going to get Mikey.

410
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:07,060
LT, this is Chief. Target is secure.

411
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:10,065
Stand by for confirmation of the package.

412
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:12,877
Be advised Mikey is down. Mikey is down.

413
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,666
Status to follow.

414
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,875
Roger. You have the package.

415
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:27,219
Chief, I got his cell phone.

416
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:34,823
LT? LT?

417
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:39,553
Chief, looks like you have two aggressor vehicles

418
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:42,289
approaching from the north, about one mike out.

419
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:44,933
You can take the truck outside the west door.

420
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:46,251
Meet us at extract.

421
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:49,060
Miss Morales, I'm bringing you home.

422
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:51,850
I just need to ask you a few questions.

423
00:34:53,092 --> 00:34:55,405
What's your mother's maiden name?

424
00:34:57,346 --> 00:34:57,890
Rosales.

425
00:34:59,473 --> 00:35:02,249
What street you were born on? Hot Springs.

426
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,200
All right.

427
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:06,989
Just hang on.

428
00:35:08,107 --> 00:35:10,125
RORKE: Whiplash, we have enemy QRF

429
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,502
approaching from the north.

430
00:35:11,527 --> 00:35:13,228
Roger. You have enemy QRF

431
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,271
coming in from the north.

432
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:17,716
Chief, you need to start your exfil now.

433
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:20,469
- Meet at secondary extract. - Roger that.

434
00:35:20,494 --> 00:35:22,179
Hey, boys, we got to roll!

435
00:35:22,204 --> 00:35:24,556
Shit. Sir, there's trucks about 1,000 yards.

436
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:25,081
Yep.

437
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,143
Ma'am, I'm taking you out right now.

438
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:31,605
RAY: Took a round to the eye - an exit wound behind the ear.

439
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,982
He's alive, but we got to get moving now!

440
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:35,231
Weimy, coming out.

441
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:39,575
RORKE: We'll meet you at the rally point.

442
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,211
Let's go! Let's go! Move it!

443
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:54,998
- Fast moving trucks! - Right turn! Right turn!

444
00:36:01,243 --> 00:36:03,595
We're not going to make it to secondary extract.

445
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,847
I got to find us a route, find this road.

446
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:06,515
Left, left, left, left, left.

447
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,538
Left turn! Left turn! Mikey, come on, buddy.

449
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,668
Hey, Chief!

450
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:17,359
We're not going to make secondary extract!

451
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:19,027
You're going to have to figure it out, man!

452
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:19,596
Hold on!

453
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:23,422
SONNY: Come on. Stay with me. Stay with me.

454
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:24,858
Stay with us.

455
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:28,236
Come on, Mike. Wake up. Wake up. Come on, man.

457
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:34,418
- We're on track! - I got him. I got him.

458
00:36:34,443 --> 00:36:36,824
LT! We can make it to rally point!

459
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:38,949
Sounds good! Pass it to LT!

460
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:40,540
Come on, man.

461
00:36:41,617 --> 00:36:43,218
LT, LT, this is assault team.

462
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:44,720
We just lost secondary extract.

463
00:36:44,745 --> 00:36:47,264
I say it again, we just lost secondary extract.

464
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:50,045
Moving to rally point. Hard copy. Over.

465
00:36:53,212 --> 00:36:55,814
- We're about a click out. - Mikey, wake up.

466
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:56,927
Drive like hell!

467
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:06,950
SONNY: Let's go, Mike. Wake up. Come on, buddy.

468
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:08,608
Come on, Mikey! Wake up!

469
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:24,255
- Got it? - Backstage clear.

470
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,294
- Rocket out!

471
00:37:41,635 --> 00:37:44,356
He's not breathing. He's not breathing!

472
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:47,442
- Breathe, Mikey! - We're up! We're up!

473
00:37:49,977 --> 00:37:51,814
Chief, let me get your M-4!

474
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:56,550
Sir, what's the status on those boats?

475
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:58,543
I lost Whiplash on the run.

476
00:37:58,568 --> 00:37:59,711
Told him you hit the target early.

477
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,233
They're coming in hot.

478
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:02,445
Roger that.

479
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:04,769
SONNY: Fuck, take this, man.

480
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:06,176
Breathe, Mikey. Come on, Mikey.

481
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:07,928
- I got no pulse. - Car attack rear!

482
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:09,041
Car attack rear!

483
00:38:11,123 --> 00:38:13,959
- Car! - Holy shit! Taking rounds in...

484
00:38:17,421 --> 00:38:18,986
Pick it up. Pick it up.

485
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:44,195
DAVE: Ajay!

486
00:38:45,741 --> 00:38:47,306
QRS coming up the rear!

487
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:57,185
Whiplash! Whiplash! Secondary extract is burnt.

489
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,021
Moving to tertiary extract.

490
00:38:59,046 --> 00:39:02,149
I have eight packs, seven Sierras, one package.

491
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:03,567
: Package with multiple wounds.

492
00:39:03,592 --> 00:39:06,153
The Sierra has a gunshot wound to the head.

493
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:08,015
This will be a hot extract.

494
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:15,039
What the fuck?!

495
00:39:15,729 --> 00:39:17,430
- Shit! Mikey, stay down!

496
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:19,166
- Keep him down, man! - Where the fuck am I?!

497
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:20,484
Calm down, brother.

498
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:22,847
Mikey's up, man. Mikey's up.

499
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,379
Stay down, brother. Calm.

500
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:26,173
Be easy. We're almost out of here.

501
00:39:26,198 --> 00:39:27,899
We're almost out of here.

502
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:46,663
"- Mikey!

503
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,029
- Hang on, buddy. - Where are we?

504
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:51,031
- On our way to extract. - What happened?

505
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:54,076
You're good to go. You took one to the face. You're a hard motherfucker.

506
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:55,619
- Did we get her? - Yes.

507
00:39:55,644 --> 00:39:56,828
- Oh, my God. - We're on our way to extract.

508
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:58,690
Ajay, splash it. Splash it.

509
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:00,800
Water! Water! Water!

510
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:06,530
Going in! Going in!

511
00:40:08,657 --> 00:40:10,086
I got her! I got her!

512
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:11,159
Out!

513
00:40:12,244 --> 00:40:13,400
Get the fuck out!

514
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:07,544
It wasn't for nothing.

515
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:21,212
You know, from time to time,

516
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:24,366
I get to see my old friends from my old life.

517
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:29,563
And it's always, always disappointing.

518
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:33,433
Some become assholes, or they're boring,

519
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:36,019
and I can't believe I tried to get them in bed

520
00:46:36,044 --> 00:46:37,405
all those years ago.

521
00:46:39,047 --> 00:46:39,547
Hey.

522
00:46:43,426 --> 00:46:46,215
It is nice not to be disappointed, Yuri.

523
00:46:49,015 --> 00:46:50,308
That's not my name.

524
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:51,350
I know.

525
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:55,406
Mohammed Abu Shabal, the son of Shabal.

526
00:46:56,231 --> 00:46:56,775
Come on.

527
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,019
Your father's name is Yevgeny. Things change.

529
00:47:01,444 --> 00:47:03,213
Yeah, things have changed.

530
00:47:04,531 --> 00:47:06,341
That's why this is the last time

531
00:47:06,366 --> 00:47:08,593
we might see each other for quite some time.

532
00:47:08,618 --> 00:47:11,611
For I might have to find a hole to hide in.

533
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:15,750
I don't understand.

534
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:18,432
I'm being watched by the CIA,

535
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:21,112
and I'm not taking any chances.

536
00:47:21,631 --> 00:47:23,566
As soon as the opportunity presents itself,

537
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:25,235
I'm taking my family south.

538
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,695
I don't have the energy to fight the Americans.

539
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,280
What about our deal, Mikhail?

540
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:32,638
My men have been training for almost a year now.

541
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:34,619
I have devoted much of my resources...

542
00:47:34,644 --> 00:47:36,141
The deal stands, Yuri.

543
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:38,581
Just because I've taken early retirement doesn't mean

544
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:40,041
I'm not holding up my end of the bargain.

545
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:41,209
There is so much to be done.

546
00:47:41,234 --> 00:47:43,479
And it will be, just without me.

547
00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:45,880
You'll have to use my trusted associates.

548
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:47,674
That's not so good for me.

549
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:49,661
- Hey... - Hey! Shut up! Shut up!

550
00:47:50,994 --> 00:47:52,831
Stop your fucking bullshit!

551
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:54,889
It's not good. Doesn't work.

552
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:56,516
You can't change it like that.

553
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:57,976
Nothing changes. Nothing.

554
00:47:58,001 --> 00:47:59,519
You just told me everything's changed.

555
00:47:59,544 --> 00:48:01,104
What-what is that? What is that?

556
00:48:01,129 --> 00:48:03,147
Do you know what I do to get here?!

557
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:06,109
Do you know the men I had to sacrifice to get here?!

558
00:48:06,134 --> 00:48:07,631
Do you have any idea?!

559
00:48:08,553 --> 00:48:10,738
No, you shit! You live up here in this ivory tower!

560
00:48:10,763 --> 00:48:12,804
You have no... you don't care!

561
00:48:30,575 --> 00:48:33,136
Hey, Chief, what's the status on Mikey?

562
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:35,513
He's definitely gonna lose the eye,

563
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:37,443
but he's-he's hanging tough.

564
00:48:39,584 --> 00:48:41,644
Hey, I'm gonna get right into this.

565
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:43,104
Great job smoke-checking those assholes

566
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:44,355
and getting Morales back.

567
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:47,483
It's a bum deal for Mikey, but that was solid work.

568
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:49,652
So, Chief, you get that down to the boys right away.

569
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:50,987
- You hear me? - Check.

570
00:48:51,012 --> 00:48:52,645
All right. Now, Morales,

571
00:48:53,056 --> 00:48:55,783
Morales was one tough chick, but she should've

572
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:57,452
gotten this stuff up the chain a lot faster

573
00:48:57,477 --> 00:48:59,787
because this thing is way bigger than we thought.

574
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:00,628
How is that?

575
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:03,207
I thought this was a cut-and-dry AMSED recovery.

576
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:04,834
Yeah, it was until we got into that phone

577
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:06,794
that you guys picked up in that shit-hole.

578
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:08,129
It turned me on to something

579
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:09,631
that just does not look right at all.

580
00:49:09,656 --> 00:49:10,882
And what's not right about it?

581
00:49:10,907 --> 00:49:12,383
Christo and Shabal are a lot closer

582
00:49:12,408 --> 00:49:13,843
than I thought they were,

583
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:15,470
and Shabal is a wild card, man.

584
00:49:15,495 --> 00:49:17,180
He is an old-school Jihadi

585
00:49:17,205 --> 00:49:19,390
that couldn't give a rat's ass about money or drugs.

586
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:21,726
And his childhood friend, Christo, the dope dealer?

587
00:49:21,751 --> 00:49:23,384
He is not a dealer, man.

588
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:24,966
He's a smuggler.

589
00:49:25,338 --> 00:49:27,148
You have got to be kidding me.

590
00:49:27,173 --> 00:49:28,691
That is exactly what I'm thinking.

591
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:30,568
Shabal wants to kill Americans.

592
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:33,821
Christo knows how to get fuckers inside America.

593
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:36,324
This could be big trouble in little China, fellas.

594
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:37,867
They're gonna hit us at home.

595
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:40,341
I just got done talking to the boss

596
00:49:41,354 --> 00:49:42,705
and the Spec OP's Task Force,

597
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:43,998
and this is what's gonna go down.

598
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:45,375
I need Ajay and Ray standing by

599
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,918
to launch for an SR in two hours.

600
00:49:46,943 --> 00:49:49,420
They're gonna get some frequent flyer miles on the way to Africa.

601
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:50,193
Why Africa?

602
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:53,383
We pinned an airfield there with that phone that you got,

603
00:49:53,408 --> 00:49:55,176
and I think that Shabal is gonna be there

604
00:49:55,201 --> 00:49:57,637
doing a weapons transfer on his way west.

605
00:49:57,662 --> 00:49:59,430
When you say "west," what are we talking about?

606
00:49:59,455 --> 00:50:01,904
- Mexico west? - Yeah, Mexico west.

607
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:03,851
That's worst-case scenario.

608
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:06,437
You two and the of the platoon are gonna stay here on standby.

609
00:50:06,462 --> 00:50:08,314
You'll be the primary assault force

610
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:10,400
in case something goes down anywhere near America.

611
00:50:10,425 --> 00:50:11,649
- Check. - Check.

612
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:14,445
You gonna be around for questions as they come up?

613
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:15,014
No, man.

614
00:50:16,097 --> 00:50:17,407
Christa" he pulled a Roman Polanski

615
00:50:17,432 --> 00:50:18,908
on my ass and disappeared.

616
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:20,868
So I'm gonna link up with Seal Team Four,

617
00:50:20,893 --> 00:50:23,287
and we're gonna hunt his ass down in the South Pacific.

618
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:25,873
So it's straight up Mai Tais and palm trees for me, baby.

619
00:50:25,898 --> 00:50:27,041
Yeah, brother. Go get him.

620
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:28,459
- You be cool. - Take it easy.

621
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:31,069
Good luck with that baby, Lieutenant.

622
00:50:32,071 --> 00:50:33,432
Does everybody know?

623
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:35,091
Only the important people.

624
00:50:35,116 --> 00:50:37,429
The important people to who? You?

625
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:38,450
I guess so.

626
00:50:40,455 --> 00:50:42,140
I'm gonna go brief the boys.

627
00:50:42,165 --> 00:50:43,798
Hey, hold on one second.

628
00:50:44,584 --> 00:50:47,061
Hey, brother, I've never written one of these before.

629
00:50:47,086 --> 00:50:50,005
Hey, I'm tracking with you, sir. I am.

630
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,775
But to be honest with you,

631
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,277
I was thinking of calling the command

632
00:50:54,302 --> 00:50:56,139
and trying to get you home.

633
00:50:56,179 --> 00:50:58,322
But now that work's picked up so much,

634
00:50:58,347 --> 00:51:00,864
I feel like we really need you here.

635
00:51:01,017 --> 00:51:04,353
You remember our last cruise to Al Ambar? Yeah.

637
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:06,914
When you had that final turnover op

638
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:08,583
and you said I didn't need to be there?

639
00:51:08,608 --> 00:51:10,251
I was laying in bed and I realised

640
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:12,462
the only thing I needed to do now was go home.

641
00:51:12,487 --> 00:51:15,089
But if something went south on your op,

642
00:51:15,114 --> 00:51:17,341
I would always regret not being there with you.

643
00:51:17,366 --> 00:51:19,969
I appreciate you taking care of me big-time, Dave,

644
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:21,846
but I'm working some things with the brass.

645
00:51:21,871 --> 00:51:23,973
If I can, and things slow down,

646
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:25,892
I'm gonna get two weeks off.

647
00:51:25,917 --> 00:51:27,643
Well, I hope it works out either way.

648
00:51:27,668 --> 00:51:28,484
I really do.

649
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:30,352
But if it doesn't,

650
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,523
I'm gonna take this piece of paper,

651
00:51:32,548 --> 00:51:34,859
and I'm gonna make it into a nice paper airplane.

652
00:51:34,884 --> 00:51:35,428
Beat it.

653
00:52:30,982 --> 00:52:32,547
We're good, we're good!

654
00:52:42,368 --> 00:52:44,554
Chief to Watch, submerge to one-six-zero feet.

655
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:45,327
Dive. Dive.

656
00:52:58,301 --> 00:52:59,049
Scope down.

657
00:52:59,802 --> 00:53:01,163
All doors are green.

658
00:53:11,314 --> 00:53:13,082
- Oh, good. Hey, guys. - Sir.

659
00:53:13,107 --> 00:53:14,584
Thank you for getting here so fast.

660
00:53:14,609 --> 00:53:16,377
- Grab a seat, please. - Thank you.

661
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:18,129
You'll have Bulldog overhead.

662
00:53:18,154 --> 00:53:20,298
We need you to get in, grab the intel

663
00:53:20,323 --> 00:53:21,799
and bounce it back to us.

664
00:53:21,824 --> 00:53:23,050
Do you have any questions?

665
00:53:23,075 --> 00:53:24,260
Sir, I have a question.

666
00:53:24,285 --> 00:53:26,220
We have the rally point and time.

667
00:53:26,245 --> 00:53:28,431
What if the meeting doesn't take place as scheduled?

668
00:53:28,456 --> 00:53:30,641
How long do you want us to stay on target?

669
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:32,095
Now, this one counts,

670
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:34,812
so I'd plan on being out there for a while.

671
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:36,470
- Check. - Are we good?

672
00:53:37,089 --> 00:53:39,062
- Think so, sir. - Yes, sir.

673
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:49,869
MAN: Ray and Ajay are rigged up

674
00:53:49,894 --> 00:53:52,038
and ready to check each other out.

675
00:53:52,063 --> 00:53:53,287
Garage door clear.

676
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:11,795
- You got a visual? - Yeah.

677
00:55:12,977 --> 00:55:14,578
Got three trucks moving in...

678
00:55:14,603 --> 00:55:16,236
a fuel truck, two jeeps,

679
00:55:16,856 --> 00:55:18,625
some skinnies in the back.

680
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:20,851
One of them has a 50-cal.

681
00:55:29,869 --> 00:55:30,821
You hear that?

682
00:55:31,287 --> 00:55:32,930
Yeah, I think that's our plane.

683
00:55:32,955 --> 00:55:34,724
Yeah, we got some inbound.

684
00:55:43,716 --> 00:55:45,961
'Bout time these guys showed up.

685
00:55:46,594 --> 00:55:48,499
Jesus. Let me get my camera.

686
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:08,799
Ray, we got two birds at the end of the field

687
00:56:08,824 --> 00:56:10,048
southeast our pos,

688
00:56:11,577 --> 00:56:12,597
no tail I.D.'s.

689
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:16,661
You got that? Check, no tail I.D.'s.

690
00:56:20,044 --> 00:56:21,200
MAN: Allah akbar!

691
00:56:26,008 --> 00:56:28,944
Ray, last time I checked, we were in Africa, right?

692
00:56:28,969 --> 00:56:30,398
Yeah. Why, what's up?

693
00:56:32,223 --> 00:56:35,352
Dude, there's, like, 16 Filipinos down there,

694
00:56:35,768 --> 00:56:37,620
all praying to Mecca right now.

695
00:56:37,645 --> 00:56:39,121
- Filipinos? - Filipinos.

696
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:40,498
Definitely not skinnies.

697
00:56:40,523 --> 00:56:41,999
I'm picking up the praying.

698
00:56:42,024 --> 00:56:44,337
I'm also picking up some Russian.

699
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:16,387
RAY: Bulldog, Bulldog,

700
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:19,829
Redrum, radio check, oven MAN: Good check, copy.

701
00:57:19,854 --> 00:57:23,207
Roger, good check. Be advised, we got two sterile aircraft

702
00:57:23,232 --> 00:57:26,633
departing to the east for the following location:

703
00:57:27,153 --> 00:57:28,718
Ten, Papa, Lima Sierra.

704
00:57:30,156 --> 00:57:31,990
Please advise when tally target, over. Roget

706
00:57:33,033 --> 00:57:34,326
Copy, two aircraft,

707
00:57:34,577 --> 00:57:36,006
location Ten, Papa...

708
00:57:36,245 --> 00:57:39,473
RORKE: Hey, Chief, you are not gonna believe this.

709
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:41,183
One of the planes Ray and Ajay tagged

710
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:42,685
just landed on Cedros Island

711
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:43,894
off the Mexican coast.

712
00:57:43,919 --> 00:57:46,397
It has Shabal on it with an unknown number of Jihadis.

713
00:57:46,422 --> 00:57:47,715
Are you kidding me?

714
00:57:48,466 --> 00:57:50,317
No, looks like we're gonna get to hit that target.

715
00:57:50,342 --> 00:57:52,570
Well, Senior and the swift boats are punching out.

716
00:57:52,595 --> 00:57:55,072
They should pull more intel for us, so we'll see.

717
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:55,777
All right.

718
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:25,561
I don't know how long we're staying.

719
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:26,538
Hold on, baby.

720
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:34,278
- Be safe. - You know I will.

721
00:58:34,303 --> 00:58:36,333
I got to go, honey. Love you.

722
00:58:37,223 --> 00:58:37,971
I love you.

723
00:59:24,353 --> 00:59:27,482
BLACKBEARD MAIN: Bravo Alpha, we're 200m out.

724
00:59:37,533 --> 00:59:39,718
Bravo, you have a tango on your starboard side.

725
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:42,600
BRAVO ALPHA: Tango on the starboard side.

726
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:51,063
BLACKBEARD MAIN: Whiskey Charlie, we have

727
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:52,312
a visual on tango.

728
01:00:12,026 --> 01:00:15,495
BLACKBEARD MAIN: Bravo, you have a viper at 12:00.

729
01:00:43,807 --> 01:00:45,100
Get down! Get down!

730
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:46,560
Clear!

731
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:48,471
Bridge secure.

732
01:00:49,688 --> 01:00:51,457
MAN: Senior, you're clear.

733
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:30,162
- English okay? - English is fine.

734
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:31,413
Can you cut him loose, please?

735
01:01:31,438 --> 01:01:32,867
If you get cut loose,

736
01:01:32,898 --> 01:01:34,958
you're not going to do anything crazy, are you?

737
01:01:34,983 --> 01:01:36,616
Crazy Ivan? So to speak.

738
01:01:37,569 --> 01:01:39,834
So you're Russian, yeah? Yes, I am.

739
01:01:40,948 --> 01:01:41,900
You all right?

740
01:01:42,533 --> 01:01:44,971
Yes, I'm good. Thank you. You're welcome.

741
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:46,679
I'm sorry. I don't know your name.

742
01:01:46,704 --> 01:01:48,013
- I'm Otto. - Otto.

743
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:49,723
- Yes. And you are? - Nice to meet you.

744
01:01:49,748 --> 01:01:50,292
Christo.

745
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:52,679
- Crisco? - Christo.

746
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:54,959
Troskawicz?

747
01:01:56,922 --> 01:01:59,066
Hey, brother, we need to make this hit count

748
01:01:59,091 --> 01:02:00,943
because the lieutenant commander

749
01:02:00,968 --> 01:02:02,778
will be working at the White House.

750
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:04,863
Oh, man. Did you carry his football?

751
01:02:04,888 --> 01:02:06,448
He better let me carry that thing.

752
01:02:06,473 --> 01:02:08,200
No kidding, man. You know what?

753
01:02:08,225 --> 01:02:09,952
Either way, that's gonna be

754
01:02:09,977 --> 01:02:11,870
quality time with your new family, bro.

755
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:13,831
Yeah, I know it's gonna be a good career move,

756
01:02:13,856 --> 01:02:16,166
but I'll be a PowerPoint commando from here on out

757
01:02:16,191 --> 01:02:18,085
as opposed to shooting bad guys with you.

758
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:21,988
Yeah, well, you were never that good an operator anyway.

759
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:25,242
Come on, man, you know you suck. - Yeah.

760
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:27,544
Come on. Hey.

761
01:02:28,829 --> 01:02:30,326
Come on, come on, man.

762
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:39,898
You're sitting on a wonderful boat.

763
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:41,483
- It's fabulous. - Thank you. Yes.

764
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:42,901
I believe it's called Starship.

765
01:02:42,926 --> 01:02:45,237
"Starship." I love the way you say Starship.

766
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:48,407
It's like Russian. That guy, uh... "Star Trek."

768
01:02:48,432 --> 01:02:50,576
What's his name, Scotty? Oh, he was... sorry... Scot.

769
01:02:50,601 --> 01:02:53,120
- I wouldn't know. - You've never seen "Star Trek"?

770
01:02:53,145 --> 01:02:54,913
- No. - Oh, that's insane.

771
01:02:54,938 --> 01:02:56,623
- So here's the problem, pal. - Mm-hmm?

772
01:02:56,648 --> 01:02:58,083
You're worth a lot of money.

773
01:02:58,108 --> 01:02:59,960
Or you were worth a lot of money.

774
01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:02,476
I believe I still am. - You do? - Yes.

775
01:03:02,613 --> 01:03:03,293
All right.

776
01:03:04,198 --> 01:03:07,301
Let me tell you how the world works there, Crisco.

777
01:03:07,326 --> 01:03:09,027
- It's Christo. - Sorry?

778
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:11,180
- Christo. - Oh, of course. Sorry.

779
01:03:11,205 --> 01:03:13,515
Let me tell you how the world really works.

780
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:15,100
- Please. - This is no longer your boat.

781
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:16,477
Since I walked through that door,

782
01:03:16,502 --> 01:03:18,437
you're not the same guy you used to be.

783
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:19,550
You're just not.

784
01:03:19,797 --> 01:03:21,774
There's nothing I can do to stop that,

785
01:03:21,799 --> 01:03:23,358
nothing I can do to help you right now,

786
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:24,902
unless you let me help you.

787
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:28,192
We need to do this together, pal... you and me.

788
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,032
So how is it that you're working

789
01:03:30,057 --> 01:03:32,506
with these, uh, Jihadi folks, then?

790
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:34,572
You're Jewish, right?

791
01:03:37,648 --> 01:03:38,668
Shabal is what?

792
01:03:41,193 --> 01:03:43,670
You got a friend, like, you grew up with?

793
01:03:43,695 --> 01:03:45,047
- Sorry? - Have you ever had

794
01:03:45,072 --> 01:03:46,715
a friend that you grew up with?

795
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:49,051
- Yes. - Had interests like soccer,

796
01:03:49,076 --> 01:03:51,053
<i>or...</i> what would you play? Baseball, probably, right?

797
01:03:51,078 --> 01:03:52,554
- Probably. Yeah. - Yeah.

798
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:54,223
And then you went on your separate ways,

799
01:03:54,248 --> 01:03:56,969
and then some years later, you meet up,

800
01:03:57,084 --> 01:04:00,145
and you totally didn't recognise the person.

801
01:04:00,379 --> 01:04:02,898
And that's what happened with Shabal.

802
01:04:02,923 --> 01:04:04,760
We share a common interest.

803
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:08,480
So he came up with this incredible idea

804
01:04:08,554 --> 01:04:10,119
because of his beliefs.

805
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:12,833
I don't necessarily share his beliefs,

806
01:04:13,016 --> 01:04:14,445
but he's a smart guy.

807
01:04:14,685 --> 01:04:16,078
You know, it's almost like...

808
01:04:16,103 --> 01:04:19,318
you know, it's almost like... like this is me.

809
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:26,294
And that's Shabal.

810
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:27,113
Is it?

811
01:04:27,865 --> 01:04:30,355
And America is in between. - Is it? - Yeah.

813
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:33,191
Cool concept, no?

814
01:04:34,413 --> 01:04:35,842
- Right here? - Yes.

815
01:04:37,416 --> 01:04:39,933
You think this is some kind of game?

816
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:42,813
Do you? Do you find this amusing?

817
01:04:42,838 --> 01:04:44,189
No. No. I'm not finding...

818
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:46,066
Do you realise what you're doing here?

819
01:04:46,091 --> 01:04:47,315
Blackbeard Actual,

820
01:04:47,759 --> 01:04:49,392
this is Blackbeard Main.

821
01:04:49,428 --> 01:04:51,864
Post nation counterpart. Secured target Bravo.

822
01:04:51,889 --> 01:04:53,115
Report to Tri Hole.

823
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:55,200
You're clear to move on target Alpha.

824
01:04:55,225 --> 01:04:57,198
Roger, Main. Clear to target.

825
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:04,088
The only people I answer to is my family.

826
01:05:04,151 --> 01:05:05,988
To my wife and to my child.

827
01:05:07,029 --> 01:05:08,117
And nobody else.

828
01:05:09,323 --> 01:05:12,384
Running late somewhere? Shit filter's full.

829
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:13,633
- Really? - Yeah.

830
01:05:13,911 --> 01:05:15,748
So here's the problem, pal.

831
01:05:16,788 --> 01:05:20,096
You do love your family, don't you? Yes, I do.

833
01:05:21,168 --> 01:05:22,769
And what about your daughter?

834
01:05:22,794 --> 01:05:24,313
What about my daughter?

835
01:05:24,338 --> 01:05:26,315
Are you looking forward to seeing her again?

836
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:27,973
Every minute of my life.

837
01:05:49,863 --> 01:05:51,496
I wanted you to see that

838
01:05:52,282 --> 01:05:55,427
so you'd think about some things very seriously,

839
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:58,138
because you're gonna be sitting in a box somewhere.

840
01:05:58,163 --> 01:05:59,932
You'll be treated properly

841
01:06:00,499 --> 01:06:01,383
and humanely.

842
01:06:03,043 --> 01:06:04,880
That girl is gonna grow up,

843
01:06:05,671 --> 01:06:07,576
and she's gonna get married,

844
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:10,947
and your wife is gonna find someone else,

845
01:06:11,510 --> 01:06:13,823
and you're gonna miss everything.

846
01:06:20,978 --> 01:06:22,543
If I had done something

847
01:06:23,021 --> 01:06:25,062
that would endanger my family,

848
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:27,937
I would feel just like you do right now.

849
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:32,214
You promise not to touch my family?

850
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:34,484
I would never touch your family.

851
01:06:35,117 --> 01:06:35,933
I would not.

852
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:45,300
Are you familiar with...

853
01:06:47,379 --> 01:06:48,876
ceramic ball bearings?

854
01:06:49,214 --> 01:06:49,714
No.

855
01:06:50,757 --> 01:06:52,730
Just imagine 16 suicide vests

856
01:06:54,011 --> 01:06:56,154
filled with those ceramic ball bearings,

857
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:58,365
slipping by every metal detector

858
01:06:58,390 --> 01:07:00,909
and every checkpoint in your country.

859
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:03,519
You think your economy is fucked now?

860
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:08,688
Just think what the media is gonna do with this.

861
01:07:09,067 --> 01:07:11,516
Hmm? It's gonna make 9/11 look like

862
01:07:11,737 --> 01:07:13,574
a fucking walk in the park.

863
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:15,345
The Grand Central Park.

864
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:17,347
So you're telling me...

865
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:21,010
there's 16 Jihadis

866
01:07:23,707 --> 01:07:25,204
wearing suicide vests.

867
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:29,369
They're gonna walk right across the border.

868
01:07:30,088 --> 01:07:31,721
So where are they going?

869
01:07:33,884 --> 01:07:36,401
San Diego, San Francisco, Houston...

870
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,780
you pick a city, they'll be there.

871
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:40,449
And this is happening now?

872
01:07:40,474 --> 01:07:42,311
It's happening as we speak.

873
01:07:43,185 --> 01:07:44,001
Sorry, what?

874
01:07:46,021 --> 01:07:47,858
It's happening as we speak.

875
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:53,107
How can you stop this?

876
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:55,824
I can't.

877
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:48,605
Blackbeard Lead,

878
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:51,229
containment element is set. Roget

879
01:11:31,329 --> 01:11:32,281
Gun! Gun! Gun!

880
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:37,229
- Clear! - Go.

881
01:11:37,544 --> 01:11:38,428
- Coming out!

882
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:43,604
Rat Pack, this is Blackbeard.

883
01:11:43,842 --> 01:11:47,039
We're in contact, midtown south of the church.

884
01:12:12,162 --> 01:12:13,046
AJAY: Walker!

885
01:12:16,541 --> 01:12:17,289
DAVE: Ajay!

886
01:12:24,215 --> 01:12:26,067
Blackbeard Lead, what's your pos?

887
01:12:26,092 --> 01:12:28,541
RORKE: Over watch. Clear to engage.

888
01:12:29,346 --> 01:12:30,026
Going hot.

889
01:12:52,243 --> 01:12:52,855
Frag out!

890
01:13:02,087 --> 01:13:04,060
Weimy, I've got two squirters

891
01:13:04,422 --> 01:13:06,667
heading south in a pickup truck.

892
01:13:11,054 --> 01:13:11,734
I see 'em.

893
01:13:16,351 --> 01:13:18,596
Get those two guys in the truck.

894
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:39,832
Rocket!

895
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:48,786
Frag out!

896
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:49,597
Sir? Sir?

897
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:53,045
LT? You all right?

898
01:15:01,039 --> 01:15:01,539
Damn.

899
01:15:02,165 --> 01:15:04,417
You checked that box, huh? Yeah.

900
01:15:05,919 --> 01:15:07,437
Good thing that was a dud.

901
01:15:07,462 --> 01:15:09,422
I might've gotten hurt. Yeah.

902
01:15:10,924 --> 01:15:11,424
Whoa.

903
01:15:13,927 --> 01:15:14,427
Jesus.

904
01:15:19,057 --> 01:15:20,783
This is not some bush-league vest

905
01:15:20,808 --> 01:15:22,032
from an Iraqi hut.

906
01:15:22,352 --> 01:15:24,325
This is some high-speed shit.

907
01:15:24,479 --> 01:15:27,608
Maybe we should put this somewhere else, huh?

908
01:15:35,615 --> 01:15:39,084
Hey, Sonny, find somewhere to put this, would you?

909
01:15:44,082 --> 01:15:45,034
Target secure.

910
01:15:46,251 --> 01:15:47,135
Set security.

911
01:15:47,544 --> 01:15:49,789
One's to the north, three south.

912
01:16:35,008 --> 01:16:36,651
Hey, Chief, target's buttoned up.

913
01:16:36,676 --> 01:16:38,236
- Everything's secure. - Thanks, man.

914
01:16:38,261 --> 01:16:39,988
LYONS: Actual, mission not complete.

915
01:16:40,013 --> 01:16:41,578
Stand by for follow on.

916
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:43,908
You only got half that Jihadist cell.

917
01:16:43,933 --> 01:16:46,244
- The target's secure, sir. - This fight isn't over yet.

918
01:16:46,269 --> 01:16:47,562
LYONS: Now, listen,

919
01:16:47,979 --> 01:16:50,206
the other half of that cell will be crossing the border

920
01:16:50,231 --> 01:16:52,694
using a tunnel network from Mexicali at 0700.

921
01:16:53,484 --> 01:16:54,919
We're coordinating with State,

922
01:16:54,944 --> 01:16:56,754
but for now the birds will drop you off

923
01:16:56,779 --> 01:16:59,924
outside the city where your POC is a Commander Pedros.

924
01:16:59,949 --> 01:17:01,634
I'll give you more details en route.

925
01:17:01,659 --> 01:17:03,726
Actual, how do you copy? Roger, Main.

926
01:17:04,412 --> 01:17:06,306
Okay, we've got a helo landing on the deck.

927
01:17:06,331 --> 01:17:08,391
We're gonna meet a Mexican SOF commander and his team.

928
01:17:08,416 --> 01:17:10,101
They're gonna help infill us into the target

929
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:11,477
and join us on the assault.

930
01:17:11,502 --> 01:17:13,646
What the hell are you talking about?

931
01:17:13,671 --> 01:17:14,981
We haven't got all of 'em yet, Chief.

932
01:17:15,006 --> 01:17:18,234
- Where's the rest of 'em? - In Mexicali on the border.

933
01:17:18,259 --> 01:17:19,569
All right. And the rest of the boys,

934
01:17:19,594 --> 01:17:20,987
how are they getting back to the ship?

935
01:17:21,012 --> 01:17:22,488
Bon Homme Richard stayed on station.

936
01:17:22,513 --> 01:17:23,656
They're gonna send in the Marine element

937
01:17:23,681 --> 01:17:25,199
to help exploit the target.

938
01:17:25,224 --> 01:17:27,243
When they're done, the boys will pull off with them.

939
01:17:27,268 --> 01:17:30,371
Okay. I'm thinking Squad One and myself roll out.

940
01:17:30,396 --> 01:17:31,956
Perfect. Squad Two stays here, buttons it up.

941
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:34,566
- Pulls out with the Marines. - Okay.

942
01:17:40,531 --> 01:17:42,383
We're moving north up here through town.

943
01:17:42,408 --> 01:17:44,135
We're crossing at sunrise.

944
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:46,971
Your other group will get to Texas the following day.

945
01:17:46,996 --> 01:17:47,676
No bodies.

946
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:50,288
Comprendes?

947
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:03,332
Hey, sir!

948
01:18:04,389 --> 01:18:05,823
Who the hell cleared us hot

949
01:18:05,848 --> 01:18:07,241
to go to Mexicali anyway?

950
01:18:07,266 --> 01:18:09,619
This one's going all the way up the flagpole.

951
01:18:09,644 --> 01:18:11,345
State Department's on it.

952
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:49,962
Hey, sir.

953
01:18:51,018 --> 01:18:51,834
Channel two.

954
01:18:57,108 --> 01:18:59,557
Hey, this tempo keeps up like this,

955
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:02,505
Jackie's gonna be squeezing that kid out on her own.

956
01:19:02,530 --> 01:19:04,882
However, we hit this target quick enough,

957
01:19:04,907 --> 01:19:07,968
you jump on a burro and ride that shit home.

958
01:19:08,953 --> 01:19:11,266
Hey, I ain't gonna need no burro.

959
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:14,377
Did you get your two weeks?

960
01:19:14,625 --> 01:19:17,103
All that time I was spending on the SAT phone,

961
01:19:17,128 --> 01:19:19,230
it wasn't to convince them to let me go home.

962
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:22,860
It was to convince them to leave your ass in charge.

963
01:20:29,033 --> 01:20:30,462
- Sir. - Lieutenant.

964
01:20:31,035 --> 01:20:32,303
Seems our governments have been very busy

965
01:20:32,328 --> 01:20:33,763
to make this possible, huh?

966
01:20:33,788 --> 01:20:35,515
All the way to the top, from what I've heard.

967
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:37,558
There is something that you have to understand.

968
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:39,310
My superiors, they're very fearful

969
01:20:39,335 --> 01:20:40,900
of a Mexican Mogadishu.

970
01:20:41,003 --> 01:20:43,773
No Black Hawk Down is what they're saying,

971
01:20:43,798 --> 01:20:45,525
so we do need to stay under the radar.

972
01:20:45,550 --> 01:20:47,193
- I understand completely, sir. - Good.

973
01:20:47,218 --> 01:20:49,445
Your team's presence here is greatly appreciated.

974
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:50,822
But we are out of time.

975
01:20:50,847 --> 01:20:52,406
- We need to move. - Tell me where, we go.

976
01:20:52,431 --> 01:20:53,574
Help piece this together for me.

977
01:20:53,599 --> 01:20:55,034
- Go ahead. - Our intel says

978
01:20:55,059 --> 01:20:56,285
they're using a tunnel network

979
01:20:56,310 --> 01:20:57,829
that is under a milk factory.

980
01:20:57,854 --> 01:20:59,623
This mean anything to you?

981
01:20:59,814 --> 01:21:01,207
I know exactly where that is.

982
01:21:01,232 --> 01:21:02,542
It's not far from here.

983
01:21:02,567 --> 01:21:04,418
Then that's where we're going.

984
01:21:04,443 --> 01:21:06,420
Of all of the places in Mexicali

985
01:21:06,445 --> 01:21:08,422
you could have picked, this is probably the worst.

986
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:10,633
The cartels control that area from all angles.

987
01:21:10,658 --> 01:21:12,468
They have us heavily outgunned.

988
01:21:12,493 --> 01:21:14,846
Simply reaching your target will be very difficult.

989
01:21:14,871 --> 01:21:16,222
Sir, we have eight foreign nationals

990
01:21:16,247 --> 01:21:17,640
heading to our country.

991
01:21:17,665 --> 01:21:20,142
Needless to say, they are no big fan of ours.

992
01:21:20,167 --> 01:21:22,478
If they're at that factory, that's where we're going.

993
01:21:22,503 --> 01:21:24,564
Lieutenant, I'll take you anywhere you need to go,

994
01:21:24,589 --> 01:21:28,025
but prepare your men for a bigger fight than you imagined.

995
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:29,819
You're not fighting eight men.

996
01:21:29,844 --> 01:21:31,362
You're also fighting the cartel protecting them.

997
01:21:31,387 --> 01:21:33,698
If your targets make it into those tunnels,

998
01:21:33,723 --> 01:21:35,764
they'll disappear like ghosts.

999
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:20,012
You enter the tunnels right here.

1000
01:23:20,037 --> 01:23:21,931
You will walk seven miles to this fork.

1001
01:23:21,956 --> 01:23:24,100
My men will tell you what tunnel to take.

1002
01:23:24,125 --> 01:23:25,962
Once you get to this point,

1003
01:23:26,544 --> 01:23:27,564
my job is done.

1004
01:23:28,671 --> 01:23:29,964
You're on your own.

1005
01:23:59,243 --> 01:24:01,785
Lieutenant, we're going now! Roger that.

1006
01:24:23,726 --> 01:24:25,495
Chief, we're not stopping.

1007
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:27,038
We're rolling up on target hard.

1008
01:24:27,063 --> 01:24:28,151
Roger that, sir.

1009
01:24:28,731 --> 01:24:30,568
We're about 30 seconds out.

1010
01:24:44,705 --> 01:24:47,766
RORKE: One mike out from the south entrance.

1011
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:23,675
Jefe! On the roof!

1012
01:25:35,798 --> 01:25:37,022
We got to go. Now.

1013
01:26:09,665 --> 01:26:10,165
Sir!

1014
01:26:11,041 --> 01:26:12,470
- Leave two men here!

1015
01:26:42,114 --> 01:26:42,614
Weimy!

1016
01:26:46,994 --> 01:26:47,494
Weimy!

1017
01:26:48,787 --> 01:26:51,168
I need you to lock this shit down!

1018
01:26:58,839 --> 01:26:59,451
Frag out!

1019
01:27:02,426 --> 01:27:02,926
On me.

1020
01:27:28,827 --> 01:27:30,324
You guys got the gate!

1021
01:27:31,372 --> 01:27:33,957
Call! You're going to the front door!

1022
01:27:37,127 --> 01:27:37,627
Go!

1023
01:28:06,031 --> 01:28:06,531
Call!

1024
01:28:57,833 --> 01:28:58,333
Ajay!

1025
01:29:44,546 --> 01:29:45,090
<i>Bomb...!</i>

1026
01:30:39,476 --> 01:30:40,360
Damn it, sir.

1027
01:30:40,936 --> 01:30:42,955
How you gonna explain that one to my family?

1028
01:30:42,980 --> 01:30:45,701
Get back there so I don't have to, huh?

1029
01:31:01,123 --> 01:31:01,623
Clear!

1030
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:25,228
Grenade...!

1031
01:32:25,582 --> 01:32:26,082
LT!

1032
01:32:31,588 --> 01:32:32,744
Chief, I got him.

1033
01:32:55,988 --> 01:32:57,825
Keep going. I'll cover you.

1034
01:34:44,638 --> 01:34:45,138
Chief.

1035
01:34:48,934 --> 01:34:50,158
DAVE: Who are you?

1036
01:34:50,727 --> 01:34:51,227
Chief!

1037
01:34:55,941 --> 01:34:58,254
Assault Two, this is Assault One.

1038
01:34:58,402 --> 01:35:00,307
Be advised, tunnel is secure

1039
01:35:00,529 --> 01:35:02,774
and all threats are neutralised.

1040
01:35:02,906 --> 01:35:04,403
LT and Chief are down.

1041
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:06,016
I say again,

1042
01:35:06,660 --> 01:35:08,157
LT and Chief are down.

1043
01:36:04,593 --> 01:36:06,906
DAVE: Your father was a good man.

1044
01:36:07,012 --> 01:36:09,573
Growing up without him is gonna be hard.

1045
01:36:09,598 --> 01:36:10,686
It's gonna hurt.

1046
01:36:11,725 --> 01:36:13,766
You'll feel alone, out to sea,

1047
01:36:13,894 --> 01:36:15,459
with no shore in sight.

1048
01:36:29,493 --> 01:36:31,595
Remember, you have your father's blood

1049
01:36:31,620 --> 01:36:32,572
in your veins.

1050
01:36:33,455 --> 01:36:35,056
The code that made your father

1051
01:36:35,081 --> 01:36:36,918
who he was is the same code

1052
01:36:37,125 --> 01:36:38,690
that'll make you a man.

1053
01:36:41,004 --> 01:36:44,269
Your father's will, his values, live on in you.

1054
01:36:44,841 --> 01:36:47,736
Like those people in the paintings your father liked,

1055
01:36:47,761 --> 01:36:49,666
we are men made up of boxes,

1056
01:36:51,264 --> 01:36:53,237
chambers of loss and triumph,

1057
01:36:53,975 --> 01:36:55,744
of hurt and hope and love.

1058
01:37:01,316 --> 01:37:02,064
Ready! Aim!

1059
01:37:08,532 --> 01:37:09,032
Aim!

1060
01:37:13,286 --> 01:37:13,786
Aim!

1061
01:37:19,543 --> 01:37:21,478
DAVE: No one's stronger than a man

1062
01:37:21,503 --> 01:37:24,428
who can harness his emotions and his past.

1063
01:37:28,635 --> 01:37:30,608
Use it as motivation to write

1064
01:37:30,929 --> 01:37:33,650
the most important letter of your life.

1065
01:37:35,517 --> 01:37:36,673
Lieutenant Engel!

1066
01:37:39,104 --> 01:37:41,213
ALL: Boo-yah, Lieutenant Engel!

1067
01:38:46,254 --> 01:38:48,567
DAVE: Before he died, your father

1068
01:38:48,757 --> 01:38:51,568
asked me to give you this poem by Tecumseh,

1069
01:38:51,593 --> 01:38:53,294
a man he greatly admired.

1070
01:38:53,637 --> 01:38:56,615
I told him I'd fold it into a paper airplane.

1071
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:58,617
And I guess that's what I'm doing,

1072
01:38:58,642 --> 01:39:00,479
sailing it from him to you.

1073
01:39:05,190 --> 01:39:07,417
"Live your life that the fear of death

1074
01:39:07,442 --> 01:39:09,347
"can never enter your heart.

1075
01:39:09,611 --> 01:39:12,196
"Trouble no one about his religion...

1076
01:39:12,238 --> 01:39:14,257
DAVE AND RORKE: "Respect others and their views,

1077
01:39:14,282 --> 01:39:16,391
"and demand they respect yours.

1078
01:39:16,910 --> 01:39:17,998
"Love your life.

1079
01:39:18,703 --> 01:39:20,055
"Perfect your life...

1080
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:22,937
RORKE: "Beautify all things in your life.

1081
01:39:23,625 --> 01:39:25,530
"Seek to make your life long

1082
01:39:25,585 --> 01:39:27,604
"and of service to your people.

1083
01:39:27,629 --> 01:39:30,688
"When your time comes to die, "be not like those

1084
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:32,817
whose hearts are filled with fear of death,

1085
01:39:32,842 --> 01:39:35,612
"so that when their time comes they weep and pray

1086
01:39:35,637 --> 01:39:37,614
"for a little more time to live their lives

1087
01:39:37,639 --> 01:39:39,748
"over again in a different way.

1088
01:39:40,016 --> 01:39:41,513
"Sing your death song.

1089
01:39:42,227 --> 01:39:44,540
"And die like a hero going home."
