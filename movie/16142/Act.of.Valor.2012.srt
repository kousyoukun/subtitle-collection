But now that you've told everyone in the

How you guys doing, huh?

68
00:06:46,346 --> 00:06:47,778
Christo!

69

Hey, I'll be right down, all right?

70
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:37,747
Whatever you say, Boss.

71
00:07:40,366 --> 00:07:41,374
How was arrive?

72
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:43,042
I left Colombia this morning

73
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,251
Colombia to here in a day?

74
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:46,690
It's a gag

75
00:07:47,947 --> 00:07:50,547
Anyway, estimate says that
Christo worth close to a million

76
00:07:50,607 --> 00:07:51,739
That's he would be?

77
00:07:51,999 --> 00:07:58,442
Yeah, and he gives back a lot to this community over here with
medical clinics, schools, political donations, you name it

78
00:07:58,723 --> 00:08:01,496
So this is the deal, they are
extremely loyal to him over here.

<i>When did the DEA have
a mobile dwarf?</i>

80
00:08:04,258 --> 00:08:07,798
When they intercepted a 707 of
his field with Soviet weapons

81
00:08:08,266 --> 00:08:10,162
This is among us. These boys overheard NSA,

82
00:08:10,266 --> 00:08:16,162
they found some interesting hints connecting Christo
toward Jihadist network out this South East Asia

83
00:08:16,658 --> 00:08:20,514
Apparently, Christo one of the guys running the network.
They're childhood friends

<i>Your father's grandfather gave up his

<i>He kept to level her just long
enough for everyone else to jump</i>

<i>That's the blood that

Daddy, can I come with you?

89
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,529
Wanna come with me?
Did you feel how cold it is out there?

90
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:48,480
I tell you what, go hang out with mommy for
a little while, help out with the baby

91
00:08:48,481 --> 00:08:51,562
when I came back in, if you still wanna go out.
I'll take you out with me.

92
00:08:51,685 --> 00:08:52,731
Promise?

93
00:08:52,931 --> 00:08:54,154
I promise. Hurry up, go.

94
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,442
- What's going on, Sir?
- What's up, Brother?

95
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,146
Not too much, man

96
00:09:04,147 --> 00:09:08,759
Oh, I know you got the New York heritage, but this
isn't exactly like sitting back on Santa Island

<font color= "?ffff01" >Yes, I know, I know</font>

98
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:10,394
You're gonna actually work
hard to get through this Sir

99
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:13,586
twelve plus series of routines.
And you don't know how to do this?

100
00:09:13,866 --> 00:09:17,210
Hey, wait until you have 5 kids, man.
Let's see how much time you got playing the surf.

101
00:09:17,726 --> 00:09:19,162
You ready to get the drink or what?

102
00:09:19,266 --> 00:09:20,875
All right man, you lead the way.

103
00:09:20,962 --> 00:09:22,666

- All right.

Double word score, 18 points.

113
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:19,579
DUMB?

114

You don't know which, Sugar

115
00:10:26,444 --> 00:10:27,732
I try not to

116

look at this,
look at this, 38 points for me

117
00:10:31,952 --> 00:10:33,967
ADUMBRATING?
That's even not a word.

118
00:10:34,035 --> 00:10:38,899
Ok, first of all, it's pronounced "atombrading"
and it means "pretending", " foreshadowing"

119
00:10:41,236 --> 00:10:44,189
Hmm..
Guess who's buying dinner tonight. Sugar?

120

Fine.

121

Language has me up for some sort of...

<i>Now he's another watchman standing guard while

<i>Mikey had 20 years in the teams</i>

134

<i>As humble as he was, you'd
never even know it.</i>

135
00:12:44,713 --> 00:12:46,418
<i>He kept a picture of his
wife in his helmet</i>

<i>And finally Senior Chief,</i>

138

<i>couldn't really tell
you much about him</i>

- Put the wild bunch down?
- Yeah

146
00:13:28,749 --> 00:13:32,021
Hey, Senior. Do you mind to give
us a scope for the ashburn?

147
00:13:32,022 --> 00:13:34,021
No, I might got that thing.

and give in work-up for the deployment, but uh...

150
00:13:42,223 --> 00:13:44,795
It's like Chief and I said, right
at the beginning of this platoon

151
00:13:46,272 --> 00:13:51,743
Once we step off on campaign, once it reversed ready
for downranged, everything back home is be unbalanced

152
00:13:52,223 --> 00:13:56,355
we will not worth the dead of each other or self,
we get over there, something out of recommendative

00:13:56,479 --> 00:14:01,970
Things aren't right with the family, things aren't right with the

Three days ago two CIA agents, Walter Ross

201
00:17:55,448 --> 00:17:57,544
and Miss Lisa Morales were ambushed

202
00:17:57,545 --> 00:17:58,757
inside their hotel room here in Costa Rica

203
00:17:58,758 --> 00:18:01,807
by eh.. unknown amount of
heavily armed assholes

204
00:18:01,808 --> 00:18:04,144
Unfortunately, Mr. Ross was murdered,
and Ms. Morales

205
00:18:04,145 --> 00:18:06,199
has been abducted.
We believe that

206
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,411
this is been a work of a guy
named Mikhail Troykovich

207
00:18:09,412 --> 00:18:12,770
A.K.A Christo. LT's going to
give you the scanning on him

208
00:18:12,782 --> 00:18:16,195
Thanks Senior.
Mikhail Troykovich A.K.A Christo

209
00:18:16,325 --> 00:18:18,625
This guy's believed has been working

210
00:18:18,645 --> 00:18:20,925
cocaine from weapon deals
between the Russian mafia,

211
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:21,843
the FARC guerrillas

212
00:18:21,844 --> 00:18:25,187
and the Mexican drugs cartels
eversince the late 1990's

213
00:18:25,372 --> 00:18:30,283
Now, before she was captured, Morales was working
on a possible link between our boy Christo

214
00:18:30,523 --> 00:18:32,075
and this guy, Abu Shabal

215
00:18:33,895 --> 00:18:38,683
Glory to Allah, Lord of the world, that has
created us as Muslims and delivered us with jihad

216
00:18:38,963 --> 00:18:40,820
on His direct Path

217
00:18:41,028 --> 00:18:44,151
Peace be upon those, who's on His
direct Path in the Day of Judgement.

218
00:18:45,195 --> 00:18:48,444
On this explanation to you,

219
00:18:48,835 --> 00:18:52,828
we are not separatists.
We're setting on all legal part of anyone

220
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,622
be you an agent are wilingly or unwillingly

221
00:18:56,623 --> 00:18:59,123
assisting the agenda of genocide

222
00:18:59,124 --> 00:19:00,249
of our people,

223
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,324
by demanding that we obey certain rules

224
00:19:02,572 --> 00:19:06,411
and by your continous occupation
of all Muslim countries,

225
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:11,299
With the Grace of Allah,
we must exile to this heed

226
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:18,808
America, you'll never be safe, until safety
becomes a reality for us. Allahu Akbar.

227
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:24,027
Abu shabal is a Chechen terrorist that
associated with the Beslan school massacre

228
00:19:24,028 --> 00:19:28,123
He's been jumping between training
camps in Indonesia and the Philippines

229
00:19:28,124 --> 00:19:29,892
Now, the connection between Christo

230
00:19:29,893 --> 00:19:32,093
and Abbu Shabal is so a little bit fuzzy,

231
00:19:32,364 --> 00:19:34,467
But if this was the lead
that Morales was working on

232
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,195
it could be why she was abducted.
Senior?

233
00:19:37,196 --> 00:19:39,891
All right, this is a personal recovery

234
00:19:39,892 --> 00:19:42,816
of Miss Morales.
All right, who's got questions?

235
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,691
See, Chief. If you have any update
resource, and tell us numbers inside the

236
00:19:46,955 --> 00:19:48,318
camp, what about roving patrols?

237
00:19:48,516 --> 00:19:49,627
Maybe 8 to 10 Bro

238
00:19:49,796 --> 00:19:51,404
but we don't know anything
about roving patrols

239
00:19:51,405 --> 00:19:55,603
you just gonna have to assume that's all working
around the squared away you just did for a living too

240
00:19:55,604 --> 00:19:57,917
Senior, what kind of weapons
on target are we looking at?

241
00:19:57,918 --> 00:20:01,916
Heavy weapons. This guys are narco traffickers, so
they can have anything from Soviet block discus.

242
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:06,436
They can have a empty UHB for the
course out there, we don't know.

243
00:20:06,437 --> 00:20:09,267
So, if there is a weapons in place out
there, I suggest you guys bring rockets

244
00:20:09,268 --> 00:20:13,745
of course rockets and bullets don't match,
so make sure you got a clear shot.
All right, what else?

245
00:20:14,033 --> 00:20:16,189
Any idea wether she's ambulatory or not?

246
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:18,446
There's ton of blood on the scene,

247
00:20:18,447 --> 00:20:20,006
and alot of it was Mr Ross'

248
00:20:20,398 --> 00:20:22,174
We confirmed that Ms. Morales
may has blood there too

249
00:20:22,175 --> 00:20:24,013
But these guys are savages.

250
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,510
So, you're gonna have
to assume that she is..

251
00:20:25,511 --> 00:20:28,482
Non ambulatory, so you gonna have
to bring stuff to carry her out.

00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:57,706
- Is it Mendelsson?
- No, Brahms.

391
00:43:58,746 --> 00:44:04,058
I am Kerimov.
You must be Shabal.

392
00:44:06,746 --> 00:44:11,058
Ok, as I said to Christo on the phone,
I have the requirement you want

393
00:44:12,746 --> 00:44:14,058
a vest

394
00:44:15,746 --> 00:44:21,446
- Cool isn't it?
- It is simple but effective

395
00:44:22,176 --> 00:44:23,058
over here

396
00:44:23,746 --> 00:44:28,058
Inside them is tiny balls made of
ceramics-based.

397
00:44:28,395 --> 00:44:31,058
Five hundred of them
woven into vest,

398
00:44:31,746 --> 00:44:35,058
They contain explosive gel

399
00:44:35,746 --> 00:44:39,058
It is our new technology

400
00:44:39,746 --> 00:44:43,058
It is truly devastating,

401
00:44:43,746 --> 00:44:45,058
please

402
00:44:50,746 --> 00:44:52,458
Here is no big deal, you know this

403
00:44:52,746 --> 00:44:57,058
It is designed for open spaces

404
00:44:57,746 --> 00:45:00,058
You have to believe me

405
00:45:00,746 --> 00:45:07,058
There are few weapons in the world
that they can operated only by one man

406
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:11,058
Look at this.

They can go everywhere without get detected

409
00:45:22,746 --> 00:45:27,058
You could take tour to White
House or wherever you like

410
00:45:29,746 --> 00:45:31,058
Can I see a demonstration?

411
00:45:32,746 --> 00:45:36,058
You kidding, you even have
no time to go to Siberia

412
00:45:36,746 --> 00:45:41,058
Listen, when this explodes,
there is no safe place.

413
00:45:41,746 --> 00:45:48,058
Imagine firing 500 bullets everywhere and
being scattered by a massive explosion.

414
00:45:50,746 --> 00:45:57,058
Take one of these to the stage,
casino or shopping center

415
00:45:57,746 --> 00:46:07,058
and create such a massal panic through American mass media.
A total collapse of economy will happened.

416
00:46:17,292 --> 00:46:24,212
Buddy, look, you're never change

417
00:46:24,228 --> 00:46:27,387
- Can I take his coat?
- No, thank you

418
00:46:30,019 --> 00:46:33,672
And now from time to time, I get to
see my old friends by my old life.

419
00:46:36,104 --> 00:46:39,076
And it's always, always disappointing.

420
00:46:41,052 --> 00:46:43,594
Some become asshole, as other boring

421
00:46:43,595 --> 00:46:47,259
And I can't believe I tried to get
them in bed all those years ago

422
00:46:50,292 --> 00:46:56,003
Hey, it is nice not to be disappointed Yuri

423
00:46:59,003 --> 00:47:01,162
It's not my name

424
00:47:01,163 --> 00:47:05,798
I know. Muhammad Abu
Shabal, the son of Shabal

425
00:47:05,799 --> 00:47:09,572
Come on, your father's name is Yevgeny

426
00:47:10,656 --> 00:47:15,787
- It's changed.
- Yeah, I think it's changed

427
00:47:15,788 --> 00:47:18,810
That's why this is the last time I might
have to see each other for quite some time.

428
00:47:18,811 --> 00:47:23,811
For am I have to find a hole to hide in.

429
00:47:24,172 --> 00:47:26,275
I don't understand

430
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:32,043
I'm being watched by the CIA, and
not there gonna be any chances

431
00:47:32,044 --> 00:47:33,782
This is the most
oppotunities present itself

432
00:47:33,783 --> 00:47:35,916
I'm taking my family South.
I need the help, the energy,

433
00:47:36,316 --> 00:47:37,759
or the will to fight the Americans

434
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,634
What about Ardile and Michel,
and they have been in training

435
00:47:41,635 --> 00:47:45,035
for almost a year now, I have
devoted much of my respect..

436
00:47:45,036 --> 00:47:47,296
The deal stands, Yuri.
Just because I've taken early retirement,

437
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:51,181
does not mean I'm not holding
at my end into the bargain

438
00:47:49,796 --> 00:47:51,181
<font color= "?ffff01" >There is so much to be done.</font>

439
00:47:51,414 --> 00:47:53,142
And it will be, just without me!

440
00:47:54,466 --> 00:47:56,154
You have to use my trust in associates

441
00:47:56,517 --> 00:47:58,081
- It's not so good for me!
- Hey!

442
00:47:58,082 --> 00:48:05,785
Hey, shut up! Shut up! Stop! You're fcuking bullshit!
It's not good, it doesn't work

443
00:48:05,786 --> 00:48:08,325
- You can't change it like that!
- Nothing changes, nothing.

444
00:48:08,326 --> 00:48:11,134
You just told me everything change,
but what is it? What is that?

445
00:48:11,135 --> 00:48:16,423
Do you know, what I do to get here?
Do you know, the man why has to sacrifice to get here?

446
00:48:16,424 --> 00:48:18,135
Do you have any idea?

447
00:48:18,632 --> 00:48:22,240
No, you shit, you live up here, this
ivory tower, you know I don't care.

448
00:48:34,327 --> 00:48:39,255
USS BON HOMME RICHARD

449
00:48:41,327 --> 00:48:47,255
- Hey Chief, what's the status of Mikey?
- He's definitely lose the eye, but he's hang it tough.

450
00:48:50,148 --> 00:48:51,723
Yeah, I'm gonna get read into this

451
00:48:51,724 --> 00:48:54,438
Great job, small check in those
assholes, get Morales back

452
00:48:54,439 --> 00:48:57,490
It's a blunt deal for Mikey better get
to tell you what was the solid work.

453
00:48:57,491 --> 00:49:00,610
- So Chief, make sure you get that down of
the boys right away. Do you hear me? - Sure

454
00:49:00,611 --> 00:49:03,057
All right.
And Morales.

455
00:49:03,058 --> 00:49:04,882
Morales was one tough chick.

456
00:49:04,883 --> 00:49:09,498
But she should've got in this stuff up to change a lot faster
because this thing is way bigger than we thought it was.

457
00:49:09,499 --> 00:49:13,030
How was that? I thought this was
cut and dry arm search recovery

458
00:49:13,031 --> 00:49:14,486
Yeah, wasn't until we got into that phone

459
00:49:14,487 --> 00:49:16,542
that you guys picked up at that shit hole.

460
00:49:17,062 --> 00:49:20,304
- It turn me out of something just not look right at all.
- And what's not right about it?

461
00:49:20,305 --> 00:49:23,314
Christo and Shabal are a lot
closer than I thought they were.

462
00:49:23,315 --> 00:49:25,522
Shabal is a wild core man

463
00:49:25,523 --> 00:49:29,251
He's an old jahadi, that couldn't
give a rest-ass about money or drugs.

464
00:49:29,252 --> 00:49:31,548
Yeah, that tells his friend
Christo, the dope dealer?

465
00:49:31,549 --> 00:49:33,667
He's not a dealer man,

466
00:49:33,668 --> 00:49:35,052
he's a smugler.

467
00:49:35,964 --> 00:49:37,188
You've gotta be kidding me.

468
00:49:37,189 --> 00:49:43,687
That is exactly what I'm thingking. Shabal wants to kill
Americans, Christo knows how to get fcukers inside America.

469
00:49:43,688 --> 00:49:49,187
This could be big trouble in little timing fellas.
They're gonna hit us at home.

470
00:49:49,188 --> 00:49:54,187
I just got done talking to boss, on the
spec of task force, this is gonna go down.

471
00:49:54,188 --> 00:49:59,187
I need Ajay and Ray stand by to launch for NSR in 2 hours.
They gonna get some friggin' flower mouse on the way to Africa.

472
00:49:59,188 --> 00:50:00,509
Why Africa?

473
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:03,009
We pended airfield there
by the phone that you got?

474
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:06,509
And I think that Shabal is gonna be there
during weapon transfer on his way West.

475
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:08,509
When you say "West", what
do we talking about?

476
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:09,857
Mexico West?

477
00:50:09,858 --> 00:50:10,840
Yeah

478
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:11,954
Mexico West

479
00:50:12,348 --> 00:50:14,201
It's the worst case scenario

480
00:50:14,202 --> 00:50:16,445
You two and the rest of
platoon are gonna stay here

481
00:50:16,446 --> 00:50:20,201
and standby, you'll be the primary assault for
worst case that goes down anywhere near America

482
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:20,902
Check

483
00:50:21,002 --> 00:50:21,802
Check

484
00:50:21,824 --> 00:50:24,143
You gonna be around for any
questions as they came up?

485
00:50:24,144 --> 00:50:28,715
<i>No man. Christo, he put a Roman
Polanski at my ass and disappeared.</i>

486
00:50:28,716 --> 00:50:30,970
So I'm gonna link up for SEAL Team 4

487
00:50:30,971 --> 00:50:33,328
and we're gonna go hunt his
ass down in the South Pacific

488
00:50:33,329 --> 00:50:35,818
So straight up, my ties and
palm trees so maybe...

489
00:50:35,819 --> 00:50:37,202
Yeah brother, I go get them

490
00:50:37,203 --> 00:50:38,371
Be cool. take it easy

491
00:50:38,372 --> 00:50:40,469
Good luck with that baby, Lieutenant

492
00:50:42,088 --> 00:50:43,011
Does everybody know?

493
00:50:43,755 --> 00:50:45,221
All the important people

494
00:50:45,222 --> 00:50:46,543
The important people to who?

495
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:47,383
For you?

496
00:50:47,551 --> 00:50:48,151
I guess so

497
00:50:50,289 --> 00:50:51,931
I'm gonna go brood the boys

498
00:50:51,932 --> 00:50:53,153
Hey hold on one second

499
00:50:55,187 --> 00:50:57,252
I brought it here cause I
want you to read it before

500
00:50:57,902 --> 00:50:59,097
I'm trusted officer...

501
00:50:59,203 --> 00:51:01,846
and but to be honest with you

502
00:51:02,722 --> 00:51:04,493
I was thinking to calling the commander

503
00:51:04,563 --> 00:51:06,020
trying to get you home

504
00:51:06,264 --> 00:51:08,302
And now worse picked up so much

505
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:11,008
I feel like we really need you here

506
00:51:11,779 --> 00:51:13,830
You remember our last cruise on Alamar?

507
00:51:13,966 --> 00:51:14,575
Yeah

508
00:51:15,041 --> 00:51:18,152
When you got that final turn over op
you said I don't need to be there

509
00:51:18,304 --> 00:51:21,580
I was lying in bed, and I realized all
the thing I need do now was go home

510
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:24,734
But if something went south in your op

511
00:51:24,735 --> 00:51:26,938
I would always regret not
being there with you

512
00:51:26,939 --> 00:51:29,691
I appreciate you're taking
care of me big time, Dave

513
00:51:29,692 --> 00:51:31,761
But I'm working sometimes with the brass

514
00:51:31,762 --> 00:51:33,161
If I can

515
00:51:33,162 --> 00:51:34,103
And things slow down

516
00:51:34,104 --> 00:51:35,767
I'm gonna get 2 weeks off

517
00:51:35,768 --> 00:51:38,027
I'll leave the works now eitherway,

518
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:38,889
I really do

519
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:39,655
But if it doesn't

520
00:51:40,748 --> 00:51:45,795
I'm gonna take this piece of paper and
I'll make it into nice paper airplane

521
00:51:46,072 --> 00:51:46,931
Bid it

522
00:52:09,089 --> 00:52:10,548
AFRICAN COAST

523
00:52:41,306 --> 00:52:42,674
Good, we're good

524
00:52:52,027 --> 00:52:56,384
- 601, emerge the ship at 160 feet
- Guide, guide

525
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,459
Hey guys thank you for being here so fast

526
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:25,348
Grab a seat, please

527
00:53:25,349 --> 00:53:26,183
Thank you

528
00:53:26,219 --> 00:53:27,967
You have Bulldog overhead

529
00:53:27,968 --> 00:53:30,194
We need you te get in, grab the intel

530
00:53:30,195 --> 00:53:31,752
and down to back to us

531
00:53:31,753 --> 00:53:33,458
Do you have any questions?

532
00:53:33,459 --> 00:53:34,124
Sir, I have a question

533
00:53:34,125 --> 00:53:36,770
We have the rally point time

534
00:53:36,771 --> 00:53:38,289
What if the meeting doesn't
take place as schedule

535
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:40,427
How long do you want us to stay on target?

536
00:53:40,428 --> 00:53:41,599
That's one counts

537
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:44,563
So, I plan on B out there for awhile

538
00:53:44,564 --> 00:53:45,846
Check

539
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:46,844
Are we good?

540
00:53:46,845 --> 00:53:47,919
Think so Sir. Yes Sir.

541
00:53:58,493 --> 00:54:04,563
- Ray - Ajay, I'll reached up and ready to check each other out
- Grab the door, clear.

542
00:54:50,493 --> 00:54:53,563
SOMALIA

543
00:55:20,827 --> 00:55:22,353
Do we have visual?

544
00:55:22,354 --> 00:55:23,641
Yeah

545
00:55:23,642 --> 00:55:24,642
Got three trucks moving in

546
00:55:24,643 --> 00:55:28,144
a fuel truck, 2 jeeps,
Some skinnies in the back

547
00:55:28,145 --> 00:55:30,951
One at the last fifty count

548
00:55:41,294 --> 00:55:41,940
Do you hear that?

549
00:55:41,941 --> 00:55:43,402
Yeah, think that our plan

550
00:55:43,403 --> 00:55:44,484
Yeah, we get some inbound

551
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:57,604
About time he's gonna showed up, Jesus!

552
00:55:57,605 --> 00:55:59,337
Give me my camera

553
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:18,574
Hey Ray, we got two birds
down here in the field

554
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:20,031
It's obvious our pass

555
00:56:21,287 --> 00:56:22,816
No tail ID's

556
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:24,883
You got that?

557
00:56:24,895 --> 00:56:26,938
Check, no tail IDs

558
00:56:36,093 --> 00:56:38,948
Ray, last time I checked
you were in Africa, right?

559
00:56:39,105 --> 00:56:40,111
Yeah

560
00:56:40,112 --> 00:56:40,875
Why, what's up?

561
00:56:42,103 --> 00:56:46,005
Dude, these like 16 Filipinos down there

562
00:56:46,006 --> 00:56:47,238
all praying to Mecca right now

563
00:56:47,295 --> 00:56:48,253
Filipinos?

564
00:56:48,254 --> 00:56:50,141
Filipinos definitely not skinnies

565
00:56:50,142 --> 00:56:51,519
Who pick up the praying?

566
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,587
Unless he's picking up some Russian

567
00:56:53,588 --> 00:56:54,888
You two come here

568
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:58,289
Be very careful with
these boxes, do you hear me?

569
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:02,088
Drop one of these and
you are all going to heaven

570
00:57:04,373 --> 00:57:06,361
Aircraft will change

571
00:57:07,818 --> 00:57:10,689
And enter through two
different border crossings

572
00:57:10,690 --> 00:57:11,763
be careful

573
00:57:13,264 --> 00:57:17,960
Once on the island, your men will
have time to finish preparations

574
00:57:18,211 --> 00:57:20,671
A friend will be
with you on the plane

575
00:57:20,823 --> 00:57:23,298
and help the rest of the way

576
00:57:24,731 --> 00:57:25,842
Bulldog, Bulldog

577
00:57:25,843 --> 00:57:27,538
we have around and we checked, over

578
00:57:27,539 --> 00:57:29,311
<i>Get check, copy</i>

579
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:34,759
Roger get check, be advised, we got 2
sterile aircraft departing to the East

580
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:36,080
at following location

581
00:57:36,081 --> 00:57:39,112
<i>Ten Kappa Lima Sierra</i>

582
00:57:39,113 --> 00:57:41,992
Please advise, when you
intel the target, over

583
00:57:42,173 --> 00:57:45,310
<i>Roger, copy two aircraft ...
Location Ten Kappa...<//i></i>

584
00:57:45,311 --> 00:57:48,400
<font color= "?ffff01" >Hey Chief, you
are not gonna believe this</font>

585
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:53,980
One of the planes Ray and Ajay tagged, just
landed on Cedros Island of the coast of Mexico

586
00:57:53,981 --> 00:57:56,703
It has Shabal with unknown
number of jihadist

587
00:57:56,704 --> 00:57:57,879
Are you kidding me?

588
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,961
No, it looks like we're
getting ahead of target

589
00:57:59,962 --> 00:58:02,171
Well, Senior and his sweep
motor punching out,

590
00:58:02,172 --> 00:58:04,760
they should call a liitle
more intel for shore sea

591
00:58:04,761 --> 00:58:05,845
All right

592
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:11,291
SOUTH PACIFIC

593
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:35,245
I don't know how long we'll stay

594
00:58:35,246 --> 00:58:36,045
Hold on Baby

595
00:58:42,156 --> 00:58:43,404
Be safe

596
00:58:43,405 --> 00:58:45,284
You know I will, I gotta to go, Honey

597
00:58:45,285 --> 00:58:46,704
I love you

598
00:58:47,504 --> 00:58:48,604
I love you

599
00:59:04,975 --> 00:59:07,206
Joann, I don't want to play with these

600
00:59:07,207 --> 00:59:12,141
Are you listening?
There's nothing to worry about

601
00:59:12,307 --> 00:59:14,456
OK?
I'll talk to you soon.

602
00:59:33,807 --> 00:59:36,456
<i>Bravo Alpha, we're 200 meters out</i>

603
00:59:46,807 --> 00:59:50,956
<i>We got you have a Tango on your starboard
side, Tango on your starboard side</i>

604
00:59:59,307 --> 01:00:01,956
<i>Winky Charlie, we
have visual on Tango</i>

605
01:00:21,807 --> 01:00:23,956
<i>Bubble, you have a
Viper on 12 O'clock</i>

606
01:00:53,346 --> 01:00:54,783
Get out! Get out!

607
01:00:56,806 --> 01:00:57,437
Clear!

608
01:00:57,823 --> 01:00:58,575
Bridge secure!

609
01:01:00,262 --> 01:01:02,022
Senior, you're clear

610
01:01:27,879 --> 01:01:29,856
Good afternoon, how are you?

611
01:01:29,857 --> 01:01:33,079
Right. Do you speak Serbian Croatia?

612
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:34,167
Russian

613
01:01:34,226 --> 01:01:35,117
Is it Russian?

614
01:01:35,118 --> 01:01:36,058
Yes

615
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:37,717
Do not speak Russian

616
01:01:37,718 --> 01:01:38,702
English ok?

617
01:01:38,703 --> 01:01:39,798
English is fine

618
01:01:39,799 --> 01:01:40,862
Let's do that

619
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:42,988
Can you cut him loose, please

620
01:01:42,989 --> 01:01:44,774
If you cut loose, you will not
do anything crazy, right?

621
01:01:45,604 --> 01:01:48,225
Crazy iron, so to speak.

622
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:49,583
So you Russian, yeah?

623
01:01:50,407 --> 01:01:51,371
Yes, I am.

624
01:01:51,372 --> 01:01:52,984
Are you all right?

625
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:54,633
Yes I'm good, thank you

626
01:01:54,634 --> 01:01:55,192
You're welcome

627
01:01:55,875 --> 01:01:57,166
I'm sorry, I don't know your name

628
01:01:57,167 --> 01:01:57,772
I'm Otto

629
01:01:57,773 --> 01:02:00,022

01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:02,429
Chrisko?

633
01:02:02,607 --> 01:02:04,208
Christo

634
01:02:05,102 --> 01:02:06,375
Traskovich?

635
01:02:06,646 --> 01:02:08,855
Hey Brother, we need to make this hit count

636
01:02:08,856 --> 01:02:11,502
Beause I'm ready promote new
Liutenant commander ...

637
01:02:11,503 --> 01:02:12,839
I'm working at the White House

638
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:14,659
Oh man, looks carry football

639
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:16,666
- It was better let me carry that thing
- Oh I'm kidding, man

640
01:02:16,667 --> 01:02:21,788
Hey you know Otto, eitherway, there has to be
some quality time for your the new family, Bro

641
01:02:21,789 --> 01:02:23,561
Yeah man, now is gonna
be a good carrier move,

642
01:02:23,562 --> 01:02:28,084
but, I'll be a powerful in-commander if I
suppose to shoot bad guys and few nurglars

643
01:02:28,085 --> 01:02:31,023
Yeah, well, truth to be told you will
never good be an operator anyway

644
01:02:32,255 --> 01:02:33,980
Come on man,

645
01:02:33,981 --> 01:02:36,085

646
01:02:38,571 --> 01:02:41,282
Hey, come on, come on

647
01:02:48,829 --> 01:02:51,744
You sitting on wonderful boat,

648
01:02:49,929 --> 01:02:51,744
<font color= "?ffff01" >Fabulous</font>

649
01:02:51,759 --> 01:02:53,248
I believe it's called "starship"

650
01:02:53,154 --> 01:02:54,205
"starship"?

651
01:02:53,613 --> 01:02:54,841
I love the way you say "starship"

652
01:02:54,842 --> 01:02:56,441
It's like Russian

653
01:02:56,442 --> 01:02:58,557
Like guy in Star Trek, what's his name?

654
01:02:58,558 --> 01:03:00,792
Scotty, I'm sorry, Scott

655
01:03:01,092 --> 01:03:01,996
I would not

656
01:03:01,997 --> 01:03:03,218
You never seen Star Trek?

657
01:03:03,219 --> 01:03:04,100
No

658
01:03:04,101 --> 01:03:04,998
That's insane

659
01:03:04,999 --> 01:03:06,248
So, here's the problem, pal

660
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:07,978
You're with a lot of money

661
01:03:08,852 --> 01:03:10,113
<i>Or you were with a lot of money?</i>

662
01:03:10,114 --> 01:03:11,783
I believe I still have

663
01:03:11,784 --> 01:03:12,532
You do?

664
01:03:12,533 --> 01:03:13,340
Yes

665
01:03:13,341 --> 01:03:14,390
All right

666
01:03:14,391 --> 01:03:15,739
Let me tell you how the world works there

667
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:17,409
Chrisco ...

668
01:03:17,425 --> 01:03:18,534
It's Christo

669
01:03:18,034 --> 01:03:18,707
sorry?

670
01:03:18,708 --> 01:03:20,140
<font color= "?ffff01" >Christo</font>

671
01:03:19,409 --> 01:03:20,740
<font color= "?ffff01" >oh, of course</font>

672
01:03:20,451 --> 01:03:21,162
Oh it's ok

673
01:03:21,936 --> 01:03:23,855
Let me tell you how
the world really works

674
01:03:23,136 --> 01:03:24,155
<font color= "?ffff01" >please</font>

675
01:03:23,944 --> 01:03:25,151
This is no longer your boat

676
01:03:25,470 --> 01:03:29,109
Since I walk through that door, you're not
the same guy you used to be. You just not.

677
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:31,916
There's nothing I can do to stop that

678
01:03:31,917 --> 01:03:33,629
Nothing I can do to help you right now

679
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:34,846
unless you let me help you

680
01:03:34,847 --> 01:03:37,476
We need to do this together pal, you and me

681
01:03:38,055 --> 01:03:41,611
So, how is you think you working
with these jihadi folks then?

682
01:03:44,009 --> 01:03:45,336
Your're Jewish, right?

683
01:03:47,296 --> 01:03:49,011
Shabal is ...what?

684
01:03:51,285 --> 01:03:54,121
Have you ever had a
friend that you grew up with?

685
01:03:54,242 --> 01:03:54,645
Sorry?

686
01:03:54,646 --> 01:03:56,782
Have you ever had a
friend that you grew up with?

687
01:03:56,896 --> 01:03:57,271
<font color= "?ffff01" >Yes</font>

688
01:03:57,272 --> 01:03:58,907
Like play interest, like soccer..

689
01:03:58,908 --> 01:04:01,157
Or what would you play,
base ball probably, right?

690
01:04:00,557 --> 01:04:01,397
<font color= "?ffff01" >probably</font>

691
01:04:01,237 --> 01:04:01,649
Ya

692
01:04:01,949 --> 01:04:02,434
<font color= "?ffff01" >Ya</font>

693
01:04:02,435 --> 01:04:05,465
And anyone has his separate ways,
and some years later you meet up

694
01:04:06,746 --> 01:04:09,301
And you totally didn't recognize the person

695
01:04:10,298 --> 01:04:12,585
That's what I have been with Shabal

696
01:04:12,671 --> 01:04:15,335
We share a common interest

697
01:04:15,342 --> 01:04:18,718
So, he came up with his incredible idea

698
01:04:18,719 --> 01:04:20,714
because of his beliefs

699
01:04:20,715 --> 01:04:22,352
I don't necessarily share his beliefs

700
01:04:22,353 --> 01:04:24,144
But he's a smart guy

701
01:04:24,145 --> 01:04:25,088
You know?

702
01:04:25,089 --> 01:04:26,778
Almost like ...

703
01:04:27,298 --> 01:04:28,127
you know, almost like...

704
01:04:28,562 --> 01:04:30,932
like, this is me.

705
01:04:35,506 --> 01:04:37,149
And that's Shabal

706
01:04:37,150 --> 01:04:37,971
Is it?

707
01:04:37,972 --> 01:04:39,526
And America is in between

708
01:04:39,527 --> 01:04:40,310
Is it?

709
01:04:40,311 --> 01:04:41,786
Yeah

710
01:04:43,065 --> 01:04:44,778
Cool concept, no?

711
01:04:44,830 --> 01:04:45,779
Right here?

712
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:46,400
Yes

713
01:04:47,468 --> 01:04:49,289
You think this is some kind of game?

714
01:04:51,908 --> 01:04:53,976
Do you? You find this amusing?

715
01:04:54,107 --> 01:04:54,751
I'm not find ...

716
01:04:54,752 --> 01:04:56,208
Do you realize what you're doing here?

717
01:04:57,345 --> 01:04:59,201
<i>Blackbeard actual to Blackbeard Main</i>

720
01:05:04,856 --> 01:05:07,734
<i>Roger Main, clear to target</i>

721
01:05:11,452 --> 01:05:13,679
The only people I answer to is my family

722
01:05:14,601 --> 01:05:16,492
to my wife and to my child

723
01:05:17,582 --> 01:05:18,935
and nobody else

724
01:05:19,987 --> 01:05:21,220
Running late somewhere?

725
01:05:21,221 --> 01:05:22,859
6 after 4

726
01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:23,355
Really?

727
01:05:23,356 --> 01:05:23,786
Yeah

728
01:05:23,787 --> 01:05:25,019
So ...

729
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:26,505
Here's the problem pal

730
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:29,272
You do love your family don't you?

731
01:05:30,335 --> 01:05:31,270
Yes I do

732
01:05:31,474 --> 01:05:32,755
And what about your daughter?

733
01:05:33,061 --> 01:05:34,025
What about my daughter?

734
01:05:34,465 --> 01:05:35,858
Are you looking forward
to seeing her again?

735
01:05:36,539 --> 01:05:38,004
Every minute on my life

736
01:06:00,811 --> 01:06:03,859
I wanted you to see that,
so you can think about something

737
01:06:03,896 --> 01:06:05,284
very seriously

738
01:06:05,609 --> 01:06:08,046
Because you're gonna be sitting
in a box somewhere

739
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:11,655
You'll be treated properly and humanely

740
01:06:13,227 --> 01:06:17,610
That girl is gonna grow up,
and she's gonna get married

741
01:06:18,288 --> 01:06:20,520
and your wife is gonna find someone else

742
01:06:21,287 --> 01:06:23,878
And you're gonna miss everything

743
01:06:31,434 --> 01:06:32,887
If I had done something

744
01:06:33,576 --> 01:06:35,153
that would endanger my family

745
01:06:35,154 --> 01:06:37,097
I would feel just like you do right now

746
01:06:40,070 --> 01:06:41,997
Do you promise not to touch my family?

747
01:06:42,191 --> 01:06:43,491
I would never touch your family

748
01:06:45,297 --> 01:06:46,866
I would not

749
01:06:53,465 --> 01:06:54,719
Are you familiar with ...

750
01:06:57,259 --> 01:06:59,434
"ceramic bullbearings"?

751
01:06:59,456 --> 01:07:00,315
No

752
01:07:01,864 --> 01:07:06,097
Just imagine 16 suicide vests
filled with ceramic bullbearings

753
01:07:06,375 --> 01:07:08,184
Slipping by every metal detector

754
01:07:08,745 --> 01:07:09,876
and every check-point in your country.

755
01:07:12,288 --> 01:07:14,074
Do you think your economy's fcuked now?

756
01:07:16,056 --> 01:07:18,407
Just think what the
Media is gonna do with this

757
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:25,448
It's gonna make 9/11 look like a fcuking
walking park, the Grand Central Park

758
01:07:27,273 --> 01:07:28,891
So, you're telling me ..

759
01:07:29,787 --> 01:07:35,927
There is 16 jahadis wearing suicide vests

760
01:07:36,322 --> 01:07:39,728
they're gonna walk right accross the border

761
01:07:40,517 --> 01:07:41,886
So, where are they going?

762
01:07:43,622 --> 01:07:46,391
San Diego, San Francisco, Houston

763
01:07:46,785 --> 01:07:48,212
You pick a city, they'll be there

764
01:07:48,738 --> 01:07:50,232
And this is happening now?

765
01:07:50,979 --> 01:07:52,695
It's happening as we speak

766
01:07:53,926 --> 01:07:54,931
say what?

767
01:07:55,995 --> 01:07:58,358
It's happening as we speak

768
01:08:01,549 --> 01:08:03,221
How can you stop this?

769
01:08:05,417 --> 01:08:07,800
I can't

770
01:08:09,569 --> 01:08:13,074

Blackbeard - Lee watch your post.

780
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:37,935
Over watch, prepare to engage

781
01:12:39,114 --> 01:12:40,152
Going hot.

782
01:12:51,342 --> 01:12:52,234
What are you doing?

783
01:13:12,687 --> 01:13:16,102
<i>Weimy, I got chaseborders heading south,
they pick up truck</i>

784
01:13:21,026 --> 01:13:22,207
I see them

785
01:13:26,154 --> 01:13:27,982
Echo, two guys in the truck

786
01:13:49,233 --> 01:13:50,483
Mortar!

787
01:14:59,474 --> 01:15:00,853
Sir, sir!

788
01:15:01,745 --> 01:15:03,894
LT, you all right?

789
01:15:10,871 --> 01:15:11,734
Damn

790
01:15:11,983 --> 01:15:13,192
You check that box huh?

791
01:15:13,805 --> 01:15:14,574
Yeah

792
01:15:16,682 --> 01:15:19,461
Good thing that was a dart,
how am I gonna hurt?

793
01:15:20,506 --> 01:15:22,730
Woow

794
01:15:24,370 --> 01:15:25,154
Jesus

795
01:15:28,735 --> 01:15:32,021
These are not some bushky
vest from Iraqi hut

796
01:15:32,321 --> 01:15:33,488
These some high speed shit

797
01:15:34,869 --> 01:15:37,123
Maybe we should put
this somewhere else, huh?

798
01:15:45,217 --> 01:15:47,614
Hey Sonny, find somewhere
to put this would you?

799
01:15:54,290 --> 01:15:55,553
Target secure

800
01:15:55,554 --> 01:15:57,171
set security

801
01:15:57,184 --> 01:16:00,114
rest to the north, three south

802
01:16:08,476 --> 01:16:10,727
Here are your objectives

803
01:16:29,632 --> 01:16:30,899
Well ...

804
01:16:32,387 --> 01:16:34,620
I'm proud of you

805
01:16:40,701 --> 01:16:42,777
We are family now

806
01:16:45,082 --> 01:16:47,359
Chief, target blasting
up, everything secure

807
01:16:47,843 --> 01:16:49,841
<i>Actual, mission not complete</i>

808
01:16:49,842 --> 01:16:53,804
<i>Stand by for follow one
You only got half that you had at cell</i>

809
01:16:53,805 --> 01:16:55,233
Target secure, Sir

810
01:16:55,234 --> 01:16:57,184
This fight isn't over yet

811
01:16:57,259 --> 01:16:58,196
<i>Now listen,</i>

812
01:17:01,786 --> 01:17:04,699
<i>at 0700, we're
coordinating with State</i>

813
01:17:04,946 --> 01:17:07,062
but for now the principal job
you have outside the city

814
01:17:07,063 --> 01:17:09,684
where your POC is Commander Pedros

815
01:17:09,835 --> 01:17:12,742
<i>I'll give you more details on route
Actual, are you copy?</i>

816
01:17:12,743 --> 01:17:14,281
Roger Maam.

817
01:17:14,282 --> 01:17:18,150
Ok, we got the hill laming on the deck, we're
gonna meet a Mexican South Commander and his team

818
01:17:18,151 --> 01:17:21,150
We're gonna help infiltrate the
target, and join us on the assault

819
01:17:22,438 --> 01:17:23,957
What the hell are you talking about?

820
01:17:23,958 --> 01:17:25,033
We didn't got all of them yet, Chief

821
01:17:25,034 --> 01:17:26,170
Where's the rest of it?

822
01:17:26,171 --> 01:17:27,785
They're in Mexicali, on the border

823
01:17:28,082 --> 01:17:31,123
All right, and the rest of the boys,
how they getting back to the ship?

824
01:17:31,124 --> 01:17:34,149
Bon Homme Richard stayed on station,
they're gonna send them Marine helmet

825
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:36,689
head all back split to target, and when they're
done, the boys will pull off with them

826
01:17:36,690 --> 01:17:37,596
Ok

827
01:17:37,597 --> 01:17:38,309
I'm thinking

828
01:17:38,495 --> 01:17:39,912
squad 1 and myself roll out

829
01:17:40,368 --> 01:17:43,803
- Perfect squad, Tuesday's here, buttons
up, pulls out of the marines - Ok

830
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:52,207
But now we know to put them to town

831
01:17:52,208 --> 01:17:53,261
and crushing the sunrise

832
01:17:54,385 --> 01:17:59,136
<i>Gather group we're gonna take
as following day, the wadis</i>

833
01:17:59,137 --> 01:18:01,137
<i>comprendors</i>

834
01:18:12,572 --> 01:18:17,219
Hey sir, who the hell clear us
had to go to Mexicali anyway?

835
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:21,057
This would do all that we up to the platform.
States Department on it.

836
01:18:31,630 --> 01:18:33,609
Border Wall with Mexico

837
01:19:00,072 --> 01:19:00,834
Hey Sir

838
01:19:01,190 --> 01:19:01,915
channel 2

839
01:19:07,373 --> 01:19:12,179
By this time on keep work like this, Jacky's
gonna be squeezed and kicked out on road

840
01:19:13,424 --> 01:19:17,853
however, if we had this target quick enough,
he jump on the burrow right at shit home

841
01:19:19,194 --> 01:19:21,349
Hey, I gonna need no burrow

842
01:19:22,876 --> 01:19:24,404
you got it two weeks

843
01:19:25,034 --> 01:19:27,040
on the time I was there on the plane hall

844
01:19:27,185 --> 01:19:29,077
you were not convinced so let me go home,

845
01:19:29,341 --> 01:19:33,624
but I'm convinced gonna
leave your ass in charge

846
01:19:52,882 --> 01:19:57,154
MEXICALI,
US/MEXICO BORDER

847
01:20:38,998 --> 01:20:39,881
Sir

848
01:20:39,882 --> 01:20:40,714
Lieutenant

849
01:20:41,128 --> 01:20:43,733
Seems our government have been very
busy to make this possible, huh?

850
01:20:43,734 --> 01:20:45,290
<font color= "?ffff01" >All the way
the tough, from I heard</font>

851
01:20:45,291 --> 01:20:47,255
There is something that
you have to understand

852
01:20:47,256 --> 01:20:51,549
my superiors, they're very
fearful of Mexican "mogadishu"

853
01:20:51,550 --> 01:20:54,024
no black or down, that's
what they're saying, so

854
01:20:54,025 --> 01:20:55,212
we do need to stay under the radar

855
01:20:55,213 --> 01:20:56,811
I understand completely Sir.

856
01:20:56,812 --> 01:20:59,342
Your team presence here
is greatly appreciated

857
01:20:59,343 --> 01:21:01,086
But we're out of time, we need to move

858
01:21:01,087 --> 01:21:02,003
Tell me where, we go

859
01:21:02,004 --> 01:21:06,429
Help piece these together for me.
Our intel says they using a tunnel network,

860
01:21:06,430 --> 01:21:07,521
but it's under a milk factory

861
01:21:07,522 --> 01:21:09,391
This mean anything to you?

862
01:21:09,392 --> 01:21:11,410
I know exactly where it is

863
01:21:11,411 --> 01:21:12,593
It's not far from here

864
01:21:12,594 --> 01:21:14,480
And that's where we going

865
01:21:14,481 --> 01:21:18,105
From all of the places of Mexicali you
could have been, this probably the worst

866
01:21:18,106 --> 01:21:20,516
The cartels control any of
that from all the angles

867
01:21:20,517 --> 01:21:24,357
They had us heavily outgunned.
Simply reaching your target's gonna be very difficult

868
01:21:24,358 --> 01:21:27,248
Sir we have a thorn national's
heading to our country

869
01:21:27,249 --> 01:21:29,736
needless to say, they're no big fan of ours

870
01:21:29,737 --> 01:21:31,964
If they are in that factory,
that's where we going

871
01:21:31,965 --> 01:21:34,426
Lieutenant, I'll take you
anywhere you need to go

872
01:21:34,427 --> 01:21:37,398
But prepare your men for a bigger
fight than you had imagine

873
01:21:37,399 --> 01:21:38,788
You're not fighting at men

874
01:21:38,789 --> 01:21:41,339
you're also fighting the
cartels that protecting them.

875
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:44,969
If your targets make it into those
tunnels, they'll disappear like ghosts

876
01:23:28,254 --> 01:23:29,922
You enter the tunnels right here

877
01:23:30,104 --> 01:23:31,913
You walk several miles to this fork

878
01:23:32,441 --> 01:23:33,980
my men will tell you which way to take

879
01:23:34,509 --> 01:23:36,604
Once you get to this point

880
01:23:36,953 --> 01:23:38,113
My job is done

881
01:23:38,958 --> 01:23:40,103
You're on your own

882
01:24:09,398 --> 01:24:10,507
Lieutenant, we're going now

883
01:24:11,219 --> 01:24:11,765
Roger that

884
01:24:34,718 --> 01:24:37,118
Chief, We'll not stopping, we'll
rolling up on target hard

885
01:24:37,857 --> 01:24:39,236
Roger that, should've
there about 30 seconds up

886
01:25:33,183 --> 01:25:34,704
SA, on the roof!

887
01:25:46,183 --> 01:25:46,704
We gotta go

888
01:25:47,183 --> 01:25:47,704
Now!

889
01:26:05,987 --> 01:26:08,067
Come on.
You stay here

890
01:26:20,469 --> 01:26:21,653
Sir, leave two men here

891
01:26:21,976 --> 01:26:23,210
You two, stay here!

892
01:26:51,976 --> 01:26:52,710
Weimy!

893
01:26:56,791 --> 01:26:57,729
Weimy!

894
01:26:59,042 --> 01:27:00,461
I need you to lock this shit down

895
01:27:08,993 --> 01:27:09,736
Watch out!

896
01:27:40,051 --> 01:27:41,786
You guys got the gate

897
01:27:41,787 --> 01:27:42,587
Go!

898
01:27:42,966 --> 01:27:44,148
Go to the front door!

899
01:27:46,978 --> 01:27:47,525
Go!

900
01:28:46,352 --> 01:28:47,100
One moment

901
01:28:47,328 --> 01:28:49,199
This is where you have to blow the bomb

902
01:28:51,237 --> 01:28:53,025
What happens?

903
01:28:53,234 --> 01:28:55,881
You will meet your husband in heaven

904
01:29:54,660 --> 01:29:55,987
Boooooomb!!!!!!!!!

905
01:30:49,669 --> 01:30:50,580
Damn it, sir

906
01:30:50,976 --> 01:30:52,629
I could explain that one to my family

907
01:30:52,630 --> 01:30:54,799
Keep back there, so I won't have to, huh?

908
01:31:11,465 --> 01:31:12,265
Clear

909
01:31:35,102 --> 01:31:36,973
Grenaaaaaade!

910
01:32:42,126 --> 01:32:43,639
Chief, I got him

911
01:33:06,277 --> 01:33:08,295
Keep going, I cover you

912
01:34:55,277 --> 01:34:56,295
Chief!

913
01:35:06,341 --> 01:35:11,898
Assault 2, this is Assault 1. Be advised, tunnel
is secure, and all threats are neutralized

914
01:35:12,327 --> 01:35:18,342
LT and Chief are down.
I say it again, LT and Chief are down.

915
01:36:14,795 --> 01:36:16,791
<i>Your father was a good man</i>

916
01:36:17,202 --> 01:36:19,588
<i>Growing up without him

917
01:36:19,589 --> 01:36:25,999
<i>It's gonna hurt. You feel alone, out
