就是他人不再视你为“强者”
was that other men stopped
seeing you as dangerous.

I've always remembered that, how being
dangerous was sacred, a badge of honor

7

你要靠准则和信念活着
You live your life by a code, an ethos.

8
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:02,939
人人如此，它是能引领你回家的“海岸线”
Every man does. It's your shoreline.
It's what guides you home.

9
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:06,669

He loved artists who painted people
with bodies that looked like boxes.

30
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:41,821
我对此不敢苟同
I 'd give him hell about that

31
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,824
他却说：“你得看见本质”

- Are you serious, man?
- We're not telling anyone yet.

44
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:24,166

- What did I just say?
- Ah, don't worry about it, man.

我知道他并不只是指那些方方正正的抽象画
I always knew he wasn't just talking
about those boxy abstract paintings.

64
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,815
世界在其伪装之下危机四伏
There 's threats everywhere,
and the world is draped in camouflage.

65
00:06:23,305 --> 00:06:24,900
这会疼吗？

66
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:28,042
不会，只是会有一点刺痛...

67

- close to a billion.
- That's with a "B"?

77
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,305
是啊，他还回馈许多给这里的“社交圈”
Yeah, and he gives back a lot
to this community over here

78
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:48,002
医疗诊所，学校，政治献金
with medical clinics,
schools, political donations,

79
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:49,578
什么都有，所以情况是：
you name it, so this is the deal:

80
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,578
他们在这儿都对他相当忠诚
They are extremely
loyal to him over here.

81
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:54,183
药品管理局什么时候才把他交给我们？
When did the DEA hand him over to us?

82
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,947
等他们拦截到装载苏制武器的波音707吧
When they intercepted a 707 of his

the boys over at NSA,

在东南亚发现一些有趣的情报
they found some interesting
intercepts connecting Christo

85
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,029
克里斯多和一个伊斯兰圣战组织有关联
to a jihadist network
out of Southeast Asia.

86
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:09,257
显然，克里斯多和其中一人控制组织
Apparently, Christo and one
of the guys running the network,

87
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,833
他们是从小就相识
they're childhood friends.

你父亲的爷爷在二战时
DA VE .' Your father's
grandfather gave up his life

89

驾驶B-24轰炸机牺牲了
flying a B-24 in World War ll.

90
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,038
他一直控制着“解放者”以使其他人安全跳伞
（B-24代号）
He kept the Liberator aloft
just long enough for everyone to jump,

91
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,444
最后同飞机一起坠毁牺牲了
and then he went down
with the plane.

92
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:28,643
这就是你血管里淌着的血
That's the blood
that courses in your veins.

93
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:32,948
- 爸爸，我能跟你一起去吗？
- 你要一起去？
- Daddy, can I come with you?
- You want to come with me?

94
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:35,854
知道那里多冷吗？这样吧
Did you feel how cold it is out there?
I'll tell you what,

95
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,655
去跟你妈妈一起照看小宝宝，
go hang out with Mommy for a little while,
help out with the baby.

96
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:41,697
等我回来如果你还想去，我就带你一起
When I come back in, if you still want
to go out, I'll take you out with me.

97
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,801

99
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,439
没什么，伙计
Nothing much, man.

100
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:55,841
我知道你在纽约玩过
Now, I know you got
the New York heritage,

101
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:58,312
不过这可不像躺在斯坦顿岛那样简单
but this isn't exactly like
sitting back in Staten Island.

102
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:00,417
你得努力才能冲过浪花
You got to actually work hard
to get through the surf.

103
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,018
- 是的，我知道

- Yeah, I know.
- Twelve-plus years on the Teams,

104
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:03,380
还不知道怎么冲浪？
and you don't know
how to do this?

105
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,386
嘿，等你有5个孩子，哥们
Hey, wait till you
have five kids, man.

106
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,422
你就知道有多少时间玩冲浪了
You'll see how much time
you got to play in the surf.

107
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,184
你准备好喝海水了吗？
You ready to get
in the drink or what?

108
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:10,656
好了，伙计，开路吧
All right, man, lead the way.

109
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:12,694
- 好吧，别搞砸了
- 好的
- All right, don't embarrass us.
- All right.

110
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:16,925
你父亲是我的“老板”，而我是他的“大副”
DA VE: Your father was my Boss,
and I was his Chief

111
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:20,901
相互熟知让我们关系紧密
What we knew about each other
strengthened our bond as operators.

112
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,200
我们情如兄弟
There was a brotherhood between us,

113
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:27,139
比家人之间还要相互依赖
and we depended on each other
more than a family.

114
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,780
图康萨说，“兄弟同心”
Tecumseh said,
"Although a single twig will break,

115
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:37,080
“其利断金”
a bundle of twigs is strong. "

好的，好的，谢谢
OK, OK, gracias.

118
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,727
哇哦，真不敢相信
Wow, this is unbelievable.

119
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,927
我还是不敢相信你在这地方点中餐
I still can't believe you
ordered Chinese in this place.

120
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,402
很好吃的
It's really good.

121

- "Dumb"?
- Read it and weep, sugar.

123
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,451
我不会伤心的
I'll try not to.

124
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:21,726
看看，看看，我得了38分
Look at this, look at this.
Thirty-eight points for me.

125
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:23,992
“adumbrating”？这不是单词啊
"Adumbrating,"
that's not even a word.

126
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:26,295
好吧，首先，它读作“adumbrating”
OK, first of all,
it's pronounced "adumbrating,"

127
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,099
而且意思是“假装，预示”
and it means pretending,
foreshadowing.

128
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,237
嗯...
Hm...

129
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:34,742
猜猜今晚该谁买单，甜心？
Guess who's buying dinner
tonight, sugar.

130
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:40,743
好吧
Fine.

131
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:44,217
世上总少不了这种耍小聪明搭档
In most cases,
officers get tactical partners.

132
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:48,017
中情局给我派了个拼字作弊的
Langley sets me up
with some son of SCRABBLE hustler.

133
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,093
是拼字大师好不好？别搞错了
WOMAN: SCRABBLE Yoda, OK?
Get it right.

134
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,288
- 多少钱？
- 免费的
- How much do I owe you?
- Nada.

135
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,801
糟糕
Shit.

136
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,578
队里的兄弟们都曾出生入死

Most excitement he found
as a kid was bowling frozen turkeys

141
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:57,991
把冰冻火鸡当保龄球来打
down the aisle at the grocery store.

142
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:02,522
雷是我们的通讯员

（一等士官 桑尼 7年拆弹手生涯 南方司令部2役期 中央和太平洋司令部各1役期）

148
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:14,675
这家伙都不愿做俯卧撑
This guy didn't even do push-ups

149
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:17,940
因为他担心胸肌会太大
'cause he was afraid his chest
was gonna get too big.

150
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:21,347
艾杰30岁后才入队
Ajay joined the Teams
late in his 30s.

151
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,205
（二等士官 艾杰 中央司令部2役期 太平洋司令部1役期）

But as humble as he was,
you'd never even know it.

157
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:38,396
他头盔里放了张妻子的照片，口袋里则有她的一束头发
He kept a picture of his wife in his helmet
and a lock of her hair in his pocket.

158
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,434

I couldn't really
tell you much about him...

162
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:48,209
...反正我宁愿去鸡蛋碰石头
...other than I'd rather
take a knife into a gunfight

163
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,041
也不愿被他“审讯”
than have to be interrogated by him.

164
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,615
在家最后一晚
That last night at home,

165
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,051
你会想着自己本可做个好父亲
you think about how you could
have been a better dad,

166
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,053
好丈夫
a better husband.

167
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:04,058
想着你本该读的睡前故事或遗忘的周年纪念日
That bedtime story you should have read
or that anniversary you forgot.

168
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,958
你不期望家人理解你所做的
You don't expect your family
to understand what you're doing,

169
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,860
只期望他们能接受一切
you just hope they'll accept it.

170
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:12,968
当你回到家时，能重拾旧日温馨
When you get home, you hope you
can pick up right where you left off

171
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,605
怎么了？
What up?

172
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:18,901
- 你神经放松了吗？
- 是的，是的
- You putting the wild bunch down?
- Yeah, yeah.

173
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:22,637
嘿，军士，介意我们说几分钟吗，伙计？
Hey, Senior, you mind giving
us a couple minutes, man?

174
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,078
- 不，你随意，老大
- 谢了
- Nah, you got 'em, Jefe.
- Thanks.

175
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,610
嘿，伙计们，你们知道我只在
Hey, fellas, you know
I only got so many speeches

176
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:31,914
特殊时刻或行动前才要说两句的，不过，额...
in a given work-up or deployment, but, uh...

177
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:35,786
...不过正如小队成立时军士和我曾说的
...it's like Chief and I said right
at the beginning of this platoon:

178
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:39,521
一旦我们出征，一旦直升机准备载我们前往作战区域
Once we step off on campaign, once this
bird's ready and we're downrange,

179
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,995
后方一切都要安稳
everything back home
needs to be in balance.

180
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,861
如果我们到了那儿却因后方误事
We 're not gonna be worth a damn
to each other or ourselves

181
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:45,696
那就既对不起自己，也对不起队友了
if we get over there
and something 's out of whack.

182
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:47,701
我是说，如果家庭有问题
I mean, if things
aren't right with the family,

183
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,670
经济有问题或是其他什么事情
things aren't right with the finances
or something's off;

184
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,073
都会让我们不安稳，所以出发前就得安顿好一切
it's gonna put us all out of balance, so we
need to have that tight before we launch.

185
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,075
如果谁有问题，现在就提
If somebody's got an issue,
bring it up.

186
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:59,306
军士能帮，我能帮，大家互相都能帮忙
Chief can take care of it, I can take care
of it. Everybody's got each other's back.

187
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:02,111
要确保无任何杂念，这样行动前
Let's make sure we lock that down
so when we 're ready to roll,

188
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,278
我们就能全身心投入任务
all our focus is on the mission.

189
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,655
敬所有曾参与战斗的勇士
DA VE .' For all those
who have been downrange,

190
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:12,227
敬我们以及像我们这样的人，“少数拯救多数”
to us and those like us,
damn few.

191
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,295
- 干杯
- 干杯
- Cheers.
- Hear, hear.

192
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,174
我还是喜欢詹姆士这个名字
I still like the name James.

193
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:29,006
我会考虑的，如果是男孩的话
I'll think about it,
if it's a boy.

194
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,370
过来
Come here.

195
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:42,724

- 谢谢，宝贝
- I'm proud of you.
- Thanks, baby.

196
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:49,026
嘿，小子，让你妈妈离卡罗尔阿姨远点
Hey, little one, you make sure
you keep Mama away from Aunt Carol.

197
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,190
我可不喜欢烟味
I don't like that
chain-smoking at all.

198
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:52,768
我知道了，上尉
I got it, Lieutenant.

199
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,336
- 好吧
- 别担心
- OK.
- It's gonna be OK.

200
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:57,531
- 好的
- 我会好好的
- All right.
- It's gonna be fine.

201
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,514
尽量保持好这发型，好吗？
Try to Keep this as long
as you can for a while, yeah?

202
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:07,014
还有别的吗，“长官”？
Anything else, Commander?

203
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:12,121
我希望第一个孩子出生时你能在场
Yeah. I'd like to be able to look into
your eyes when our first child is born.

204
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,349
你知道我会尽力的
You know I'll do my best.

205
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,231
我爱你，宝贝
I love you, baby.

206
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:28,565
我也爱你
Love you.

00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,204
战争是国家意志的体现
DA VE.' War is a country of will.

208
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:38,541
容不得半点同情心
There 's no room for sympathy.

209
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:43,380
如果不愿抛弃一切，你就已经输了
If you're not willing to give up everything,
you've already lost.

210
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,056
我们抓到她了，不过她干掉了吉伯特

I know who you are, Miss Morales,

所以何不节约大家时间
So why don't you
save us both some time

感觉如何，莫拉里斯小姐？
CHRIS TO: How did that feel,
Miss Morales?

224

望您能对“服务”满意
Have a great day at the spa.

225
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,798
关掉手机免提

226
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,108
别把她弄死了，等她开口了打给我

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,654
引领我们进行圣战
and delivered us with the jihad
on his direct path.

251
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:42,322
遵循真主旨意直至审判日者才能得到和平
Peace be upon those who follow his
direct path till the Day of Judgment.

252
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:45,230
我要告诉你们美国人
Let me explain this to you Americans.

253
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,097
我们不是分裂分子
We are not separatists.

254
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:50,240
我们车臣不属于任何国家
We Chechens are not
a legal part of anyone,

255
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:54,935
但是你们美国人通过强制推行政策
but you Americans are willingly
or unwillingly assisting

256
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:59,810
和侵占所有穆斯林国家
in the genocide of our people
by demanding that we obey certain rules,

257
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:04,421
一直在有意或无意地帮助屠杀我们族人
and by your continued
occupation of all Muslim countries.

258
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:08,353
以万能，神圣的真主之名起誓
With the grace of Allah,
glorious and exalted is he,

259
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:14,362
我们没有安全保障，那美国也不得安宁
America will never be safe
until safety becomes a reality for us.

260
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,659
真主万岁
Allahu Akbar

261
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,927
阿布・谢布尔是车臣恐怖分子
LT: Abu Shabal is
a Chechen terrorist

262
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:21,435
他和别斯兰学校屠杀事件有关
（2004年9月1日俄罗斯别斯兰人质事件）
who's associated with
the Beslan School Massacre.

263
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,599
他一直活跃于印度尼西亚和菲律宾的训练基地
He's been jumping between training camps
in Indonesia and the Philippines.

264
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:29,268
目前克里斯多和他之间的联系目前还有点不清楚
Now, the connection between Christo
and Abu Shabal is still a little bit fuzzy,

265
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:32,108
不过如果这是莫拉里斯正在查的线索
but if this was the lead
that Morales was working on,

266
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,683
那就很可能是她被绑架的原因，军士？
it could be why
she was abducted. Senior?

267
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,548
好的，这是莫拉里斯的个人资料
All right, this is a personnel
recovery of Miss Morales.

268
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,347
好的，有问题吗？
All right, who's got questions?

269
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,788
军士，你有最新数据吗
Senior Chief, you got
any updated source intel

270
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:45,622
关于敌营人数的，还有巡逻队呢？
on numbers inside the camp,
and what about roving patrols?

271
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:48,697
大约8-10个，伙计，但我们对巡逻队一无所知
Maybe eight to ten, bro, but we don't
know anything about roving patrols.

272
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,527
你只能假设他们在那儿
You're just gonna have to assume
that they're out there

273
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,794
布防严密，还是专业人士
walking around, squared away.
They do this for a living, too.

274
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,302
军士，敌方武器装备如何？
Senior, what kind of weapons-on-target
are we looking at?

275
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,566
重武器，这些家伙是毒贩子
Heavy weapons.
These guys are narco-traffickers,

276
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,834
所以他们什么都会有，从苏制DShK大口径机枪
so they can have anything
from Soviet-bloc DShKs.

277
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:02,740
到美制M2HP12.7毫米重机枪都有可能
They could have M2HP,
.50-cals out there, we don't know.

278
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:06,041
所以如果可以的话，我建议你们带火箭筒
So if there is a weapons' emplacement up
there, I suggest you guys bring rockets.

279
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,743
当然火箭筒威力大，这样就有取胜把握了
Of course, rockets and foliage don't match,
so make sure you got a clear shot.

280
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:11,148
好的，还有什么？
All right, what else?

281
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:13,586
她自己能走得动吗？
Any idea whether she's ambulatory or not?

282
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:15,315
现场都是血迹
There was a ton of blood on the scene,

283
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,892
我们肯定大部分是罗斯的
and a lot of it was Mr. Ross',
we confirmed that.

284
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,088
莫拉里斯的可能也有，不过这些人都是禽兽
Miss Morales may have bled there, too,
but these guys are savages,

285
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,824
所以只能假设她根本走不动了
so you're gonna have to assume
that she is non-ambulatory,

286
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:26,265
必须带工具把她抬出来
so you're gonna have
to bring stuff to carry her out.

287
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:31,830
2分钟后跳伞
MAN OVER PA:
Two minutes to drop.

288
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,613
嘿，上尉
Hey, LT.

289
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:50,021
你一定要告诉我们那人是谁，等回来好去揍他一顿
You got to let us know who that guy is,
so when we get back, we can kick his ass.

290
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,059
你说谁呢？
What guy?

291
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:54,720
给你做这鸟发型的家伙
The guy that gave you
that fucked-up haircut.

292
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,068
- 操
- 该死，桑尼
- Fuck.
- AJAY: Damn, Sonny,

293
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:02,296
还好意思说，你自己不也是“大光头”先生
you should be the last guy to talk.
You look like the Dominican Mr. Clean.

294
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:05,465
我的头跟你的金牙一样亮，是吧？
SONNY: That means my head
shines like your gold teeth, huh?

295
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,770
别这样说
Don't be like that,

296
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:08,775
- 很伤自尊的
- 开舱门！
- that's harsh.
- Ramp!

297
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,544
戴上面罩
Mask up.

298
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:19,817
伙计，告诉你，现在唯一比这要好的事就是做爸爸了
Man, I tell you what. The only thing better
than this right here is being a dad,

299
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:22,481
换尿布除外，不过...
except for that whole
changing diaper thing, but...

300
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,753
不管怎样桑迪会干的，所以...
...Sandy does that for me anyway, so...

301
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,725
其实我还是挺期待的
I'm actually looking forward to it.

302
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,393

All boots are on the ground.
I pass T-bird.

310
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:38,177
目前有什么动静吗？
Any traffic for my station
at this time?

311
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:41,187
黑胡，侦查显示第二地点车辆
MAN OVER RADIO: Actual,

312

I feel like we're pretty thin.
I'd like to take you guys with us.

337
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:29,147
上士，特战舟艇分队正在赶来，“大乌鸦”也在朝我飞来
Chief, I got a SBT coming up on-step.
I got a Raven pushing my pos.

338
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:30,718

Weimy and I are

00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,821

- Chief, I'm going to get Mikey.

361
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:14,493

vehicles approaching from the north,

368
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:51,260

about one mike out. You can take
the truck outside the west door

369
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,527
我们在撤退点会合
Meet us at extract.

370
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:56,535
莫拉里斯小姐，我要带你回家了
Miss Morales, I'm bringing you home.

371
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:58,640
我只需要问你点问题
I just need to ask you a few questions.

372
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:02,543
你母亲姓什么？
What's your mother's maiden name?

373
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:06,381
罗萨丽斯

374
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:08,483
你在哪条街出生？
What street you were born on?

375
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:11,412
温泉街
Hot Springs.

376
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:15,046
好的，坚持住
All right. Just hang on.

377
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,427
皮鞭，北边有敌军快反部队赶来
Whiplash, we have enemy QRF
approaching from the north.

378
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:22,429
收到，北边有敌军快反部队赶来
Roger. You have enemy QRF
coming in from the north.

379
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:24,658
上士，你得马上离开
Chief, you need to start your exfil now.

380
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:27,393
- 我们在第二撤退点会合
- 收到
- We 'll meet you at secondary extract.
- Roger that.

381
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:29,265
嘿，兄弟们，我们要走了！
Hey, boys, we gotta roll!

382
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:31,600
糟了，长官，是敌车辆
Shit. Sir, it's those trucks,

383
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:33,173
- 大约1000码
- 是的
- about 1,000 yards.
- Yep.

384
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:35,106
女士，我马上带你走
Ma'am, I'm taking you out right now.

385
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:38,611
嘿，上士，他眼睛中枪，耳朵后面开了个口子
Hey, Chief, he took a round to the eye
with the exit wound behind the ear.

386
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:41,045
他还活着，但是我们得立刻离开！
He's alive, but we gotta get moving now!

387
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,614
怀明，我们出来了
Weimy, coming out.

388
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:45,344
我们在集合点汇合
OVER RADIO:
We'll meet you at the rally point.

389
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:50,417
我们走！我们走！开车！
Let's go! Let's go! Move it!

390
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,769
- 小心！左边有敌人！
- 右转！右转！
- Heads up! Fast movement on the left!
- Right turn! Right turn!

391
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,501
嘿，伙计，我们到不了第二撤退点了
Hey, man, we're not going
to make it to secondary extract.

392
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,545
我得找条路出来，注意看路
I got to find us a route.
Stay on this road.

393
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:15,616
- 左边，左边，左边
- 左转！左转！
- Left, left, left.
- Left turn! Left turn!

394
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:17,150
麦奇，挺住，兄弟！
Mikey, come on, buddy.

395
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,353
嘿，上士！
Hey, Chief!

396
00:36:22,046 --> 00:36:24,287
我们到不了第二撤退点了
We're not gonna make secondary extract!

397
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:27,258
- 无论如何都要赶到，伙计！
- 抓紧！
- You're gonna have to figure it out, man!
- Hold on!

398
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:29,397
加油，挺住，挺住
Come on. Stay with me.
Stay with me.

399
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:32,157
挺住
Stay with us.

400
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:35,202
加油，麦奇，醒醒，醒醒，加油，伙计
Come on, Mike. Wake up.
Wake up. Come on, man.

401
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,471
- 接敌！
- 加速，加速
- Contact!
- Pick it up, pick it up.

402
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,079
上士！我们可以赶到集合点！
Yo, Chief!
We can make it to rally point!

403
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:47,546
- 很好！告诉上尉！
- 加油，伙计
- Sounds good! Pass it to LT!
- Come on, man.

404
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:52,553
呼叫上尉，呼叫上尉，我是突击队，我们刚错过第二撤退点
LT, LT, this is assault team.
We just lost the secondary extract.

405
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,156
重复一遍，我们刚错过第二撤退点
I say again, we just lost
secondary extract.

406
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:56,849
前往集结点中，收到吗，请回？
Moving to rally point.
How copy, over?

407
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:01,924
- 大约还有1公里
- 麦奇，醒醒
- We're about a click out.
- Mikey, wake up.

408
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:03,888
还有一公里！
One click out!

409
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:13,900
起来，麦奇，醒醒，加油，兄弟
Let's go, Mike.
Wake up. Come on, buddy.

410
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,511
加油，麦奇！醒醒！
Come on, Mikey! Wake up!

411
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,087
- 好了吗？
- 可以发射
- Good?
- Backstage clear.

412
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:33,925
发射！
Rocket out!

413
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:51,646
他没呼吸了！
He's not breathing!

414
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:53,611
- 呼吸，麦奇！
- 我们上来了！我们上来了！
- Breathe, Mikey!
- We're up! We're up!

415
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,111
上士，把你的M4卡宾枪给我！
Chief, let me get your M-4!

416
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:03,723
长官，撤退船只在哪里？
Sir, what's the status
on those boats?

417
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:05,588
撤退时跟皮鞭失去联系了
I lost Whiplash on the run.

418
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,663
跟他们说过行动提前了，皮鞭正在火速赶来
Told 'em you hit the target early.
They're coming in hot.

419
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:11,891
- 收到
- 操！撑住，伙计
- Roger that.
- Fuck! Take this, man.

420
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:13,228
呼吸，麦奇，加油，麦奇
Breathe, Mikey. Come on, Mikey.

421
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:15,428
- 他没脉搏了
- 后方接敌！
- I got no pulse.
- Contact rear!

422
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:16,594
后方接敌！
Contact rear!

423
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:19,839
我靠！
Holy shit!

424
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:20,998
子弹飞进...
Taking rounds in...

425
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:26,245
加速，加速
Pick it up. Pick it up.

426
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:54,974
艾杰！快反部队在后面！
Ajay! QRF coming up the rear!

427
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:04,210
皮鞭！皮鞭！第二撤退点废了
Whiplash! Whiplash!
Secondary extract is burnt.

428
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:06,048
正赶往第三撤退点
Moving to tertiary extract.

429
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:09,157
一共8人，7名队员，一名目标
I have eight packs,
seven Sierras, one package.

430
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:10,553
目标多处受伤
OVER RADIO: Package
with multiple wounds.

431
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:13,161
一名队员头部中枪
The Sierra has gunshot wound
to the head.

432
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:15,388
撤退会很艰难
This will be a hot extract.

433
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:23,170
什么情况？！
What the fuck?!

434
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:24,897
- 哦，该死！
- 麦奇，趴下！
- Oh, shit!
- Mikey, stay down!

435
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:27,167
- 按倒他，伙计！
- 我他妈在哪儿？
- Keep him down, man!
- MIKEY: Where the fuck am I?!

436
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:30,073
- 冷静，兄弟
- 麦奇醒了，麦奇醒了
- Calm down, brother.
- Mikey's up, man. Mikey's up.

437
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:33,215
趴下，兄弟，冷静，放松，我们马上就突围出去了
Stay down, brother. Calm.
Be easy. We're almost out of here.

438
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,475
我们马上就突围出去了
We're almost out of here.

439
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,567
麦奇！
Mikey!

440
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,204
- 坚持住，兄弟
- 我们在哪儿？
- Hang on, buddy.
- MIKEY: Where are we?

441
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,067
- 在撤退路上
- 怎么回事？
- We're on our way to extract.
- What happened?

442
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,867
没事了，你脸上中枪，伙计
You're good to go.
You took one to the face, man.

443
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,100
你这个打不死的家伙
You're a hard motherfucker.

444
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:02,403
- 我们救到她了吗？
- 是的
- Did we get her?
- Yes.

445
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:03,874
- 哦，天啊
- 我们在撤退路上
- Oh, my God.
- We're on our way to extract.

446
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:06,412
艾杰，冲啊，冲啊
Ajay, splash it. Splash it.

447
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,676
到河边了，到河边了！
Water! Water! Water!

448
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,686
冲河里了！冲河里了！
Going in! Going in!

449
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,715
我抬着她！我抬着她！
I got her! I got her!

450
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:19,020
车要沉了
It's fucking going under.

451
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:20,856
出去！他妈的快出去！
Out! Get the fuck out!

452
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:16,007
我们没白来
ECHOING: It wasn't for nothing.

453
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:06,000
乌克兰

454
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,441
干什么的？

455
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:50,569
门德尔松的曲子？

456
00:43:52,694 --> 00:43:54,900
不是，勃拉姆斯的

457
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,498
克里莫夫在哪里？

458
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,901
你是谢布尔吧？

459
00:44:03,435 --> 00:44:08,800
就像我在电话里跟克里斯多说的，我这儿有你想要的东西

460
00:44:13,011 --> 00:44:15,010
很轻吧？

461
00:44:15,343 --> 00:44:18,800
能穿在燕尾服里

462
00:44:21,149 --> 00:44:25,500
衣服内部装着许多小陶瓷球

463
00:44:25,685 --> 00:44:27,930
多达500个

464
00:44:28,587 --> 00:44:36,200
衣服里织着新型凝胶炸药

465
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,230
这是毁灭性的武器

466
00:44:40,697 --> 00:44:42,300
就是它

467
00:44:47,871 --> 00:44:53,274
我知道它看起来不起眼

468
00:44:54,376 --> 00:44:56,941
这是设计用于开放式环境的

469
00:44:57,643 --> 00:45:01,246
相信我，世上没有比这威力更大的

470
00:45:01,246 --> 00:45:05,000
单人操纵武器了

471
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:06,580
你看

472
00:45:14,622 --> 00:45:19,400
一切都考虑到了

473
00:45:19,494 --> 00:45:23,397
你可以穿着它自由进出白宫

474
00:45:27,332 --> 00:45:29,233
我能看看演示吗？

475
00:45:29,869 --> 00:45:32,570
你有空去西伯利亚吗？

476
00:45:33,536 --> 00:45:35,539
这个玩意爆炸的时候

477
00:45:35,606 --> 00:45:38,608
周围所有人都得死绝

478
00:45:39,107 --> 00:45:42,477
想想有500颗子弹飞向四周

479
00:45:42,577 --> 00:45:45,578
然后全部爆开来

480
00:45:48,015 --> 00:45:52,816
你带着它去球场

481
00:45:52,884 --> 00:45:55,453
或者是赌场，或者是购物商场

482
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:59,690
就会引起美国媒体的极大恐慌

483
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:03,890
接着你就会看到经济崩溃。。。

484
00:46:15,574 --> 00:46:17,600
伙计，看看你

485
00:46:17,817 --> 00:46:20,296
你还是老样子

486
00:46:21,461 --> 00:46:24,539
- 需要我为您拿走外衣吗？
- 不用，谢谢

487
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:28,590
知道吗，时不时地
You know, from time to time,

488
00:46:28,752 --> 00:46:32,564
我会去看我的老朋友们
I get to see my old friends
from my old life.

489
00:46:34,425 --> 00:46:36,427
但总是，总是让人失望
And it's always, always disappointing.

490
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:41,467
有些人成了混蛋，另一些则很无趣
Some become assholes,
other boring,

491
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,636
真不敢相信我以前跟他们交情那么好
and I can't believe I tried to get them
in bed all those years ago.

492
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:50,782
嘿
Hey.

493
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:53,182
真高兴你没让我失望，尤里
It is nice not to be disappointed, Yuri.

494
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:00,050
- 这不是我的名字
- 我知道
- That's not my name.
- I know.

495
00:47:00,251 --> 00:47:03,596
默罕默德・阿布・谢布尔，谢布尔之子
Mohammed Abu Shabal,
the son of Shabal

496
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:06,530
拜托，你父亲叫尤基尼
Come on.
Your father's name is Yevgeny.

497
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:08,934
事情会变的
Things change.

498
00:47:09,904 --> 00:47:11,474
是啊，是变了
Yeah, things have changed.

499
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,917
所以相当长时间内这应该是我最后一次见你了
That's why this is the last time we might
have to see each other for quite some time.

500
00:47:16,077 --> 00:47:19,217
因为我得找个地方躲起来
For I might have
to find a hole to hide in.

501
00:47:22,317 --> 00:47:23,796
我不明白
I don't understand.

502
00:47:24,953 --> 00:47:28,901
我被中情局盯上了，我不想冒险
I'm being watched by the CIA,
and I'm not taking any chances.

503
00:47:29,057 --> 00:47:32,732
只要一有机会，我就举家南下
As soon as the opportunity presents itself,
I'm taking my family south.

504
00:47:32,861 --> 00:47:35,068
我既无能力又无动力和美国人作对
I neither have the energy or the will
to fight the Americans.

505
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:37,904
我们的生意怎么办，米哈伊尔？
What about our deal, Mikhail?

506
00:47:38,066 --> 00:47:40,478
我的人受训将近一年了
My men have been training
for almost a year now.

507
00:47:40,635 --> 00:47:43,616
- 我往里面砸了很多钱
- 合作仍然有效，尤里
- I have devoted much of my resources...
- The deal stands, Yuri.

508
00:47:43,771 --> 00:47:45,944
我提早“退休”不等于
Just because I've taken
early retirement does not mean

509
00:47:46,107 --> 00:47:47,415
我不管生意了
I'm not holding up
my end of the bargain.

510
00:47:47,575 --> 00:47:48,576
要做的事情还有很多
There is so much to be done.

511
00:47:48,743 --> 00:47:51,485
都会继续的，只不过我不参与
And it will be, just without me.

512
00:47:51,646 --> 00:47:53,182
你可以利用我信任的人
You'll have to use
my trusted associates.

513
00:47:53,348 --> 00:47:55,089
这根本不够
That's not so good for me.

514
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:56,490
- 嘿...
- 嘿！闭嘴！
- Hey...
- Hey! Shut up!

515
00:47:57,352 --> 00:47:58,330
闭嘴！
Shut up!

516
00:47:58,486 --> 00:48:00,864
别再满嘴胡言了！
Stop your fucking bullshit!

517
00:48:01,022 --> 00:48:03,832
这不够，根本没用，你不能说变就变
It's not good. Doesn't work.
You can't change it like that.

518
00:48:03,992 --> 00:48:06,836
- 什么都没变啊，什么都没！
- 你刚跟我说一切都变了
- Nothing changes. Nothing.
- You just told me everything's changed.

519
00:48:07,195 --> 00:48:08,697
这又是怎么回事？这又是怎么回事？
What... What is that?
What is that?

520
00:48:08,863 --> 00:48:10,774
你知道我怎样才走到这一步？
Do you know what I do to get here?!

521
00:48:10,932 --> 00:48:13,378
又牺牲了多少同胞？！
Do you know the men who I've
had to sacrifice to get here?!

522
00:48:13,535 --> 00:48:15,845
你懂不懂啊？！
Do you have any idea?!

523
00:48:16,004 --> 00:48:18,109
根本就不懂，混蛋！你住在象牙塔里，什么都不管
No, you shit! You live up here
in this ivory tower!

524
00:48:18,273 --> 00:48:20,275
你根本...根本不在乎！
You have no... You don't care!

525
00:48:31,653 --> 00:48:37,000
美国黄蜂级两栖攻击舰第6艘“好人理查德”号 中美洲海岸

526
00:48:37,692 --> 00:48:40,263
上士，麦奇伤势怎样？
Hey, Chief, what's the status on Mikey?

527
00:48:40,461 --> 00:48:45,001
眼睛保不住了，不过他能挺过去
He's definitely gonna lose the eye,
but he's... he's hanging tough.

528
00:48:46,701 --> 00:48:48,647
嘿，我得跟传达下表彰
Hey, I'm gonna get right into this.

529
00:48:48,803 --> 00:48:51,306
你们沉重痛击了敌人，救回了莫拉里斯
Great job smoke-checking those
assholes and getting Morales back.

530
00:48:51,472 --> 00:48:54,476
对麦奇来说有点不划算，不过还是得说大家干得好
It's a bum deal for Mikey, but I gotta
tell you what, that was solid work.

531
00:48:54,609 --> 00:48:56,646
上士，你得把这些传达给兄弟们
So, Chief, you make sure you get
that down to the boys right away.

532
00:48:56,811 --> 00:48:57,983
- 听见了么？
- 明白
- You hear me?
- Check.

533
00:48:58,145 --> 00:49:01,922
好的，现在我们谈谈莫拉里斯，她很坚强
All right. Now, Morales,
Morales was one tough chick,

534
00:49:02,083 --> 00:49:04,427
但是她让事情变化的很快
but she should've gotten
the stuff up the chain a lot faster

535
00:49:04,585 --> 00:49:06,758
因为事情比我们想象的要复杂的多
because this thing is way
bigger than we thought it was.

536
00:49:06,921 --> 00:49:10,198
怎么会?我以为这只是普通的美国人质营救行动
How is that? I thought this was
a cut-and-dry AMCIT recovery.

537
00:49:10,358 --> 00:49:13,771
是的，但是你们在那个地方找到的手机改变了一切
Yeah, it was until we got into that phone
that you guys picked up in that shithole.

538
00:49:13,928 --> 00:49:16,568
这让我觉得事情很不对劲
It turned me on to something
that just does not look right at all.

539
00:49:16,731 --> 00:49:19,678
- 哪里不对了？
- 克里斯多和谢布尔远比我们想象的要“亲密”的多
- And what's not right about it?
- Christo and Shabal are a lot closer

540
00:49:19,834 --> 00:49:22,508
谢布尔是个不安定因素
than I thought they were,
and Shabal is a wild card, man.

541
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:26,379
他是个死板的圣战分子， 对金钱和毒品一点儿也不在乎
He is an old-school jihadi that couldn't
give a rat's ass about money or drugs.

542
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:28,679
是啊，那他的老朋友克里斯多，那个毒贩子呢？
Yeah, and his childhood friend,
Christo, the dope dealer?

543
00:49:28,843 --> 00:49:32,222
伙计，他是在搞走私，不是搞贩毒
He is not a dealer, man.
He's a smuggler.

544
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:35,691
- 你一定在开玩笑
- 这就是我现在想的
- You have got to be kidding me.
- That is exactly what I'm thinking.

545
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:37,523
谢布尔想杀美国人
Shabal wants to kill Americans.

546
00:49:37,685 --> 00:49:40,825
克里斯多知道怎么把那些混蛋们带进美国
Christo knows how to get
fuckers inside America.

547
00:49:41,022 --> 00:49:43,298
这可是个大麻烦
This could be big trouble
in little China, fellas.

548
00:49:43,457 --> 00:49:44,959
他们要袭击美国本土
They're gonna hit us at home.

549
00:49:46,894 --> 00:49:49,465
我刚跟特种部队和指挥官商量过
I just got done talking to the boss
and the Spec Ops Task Force,

550
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:50,973
这是下一步的计划
and this is what's gonna go down.

551
00:49:51,132 --> 00:49:53,908
让艾杰和雷准备两小时后登上潜艇
I need Ajay and Ray standing by
to launch for an SR in two hours.

552
00:49:54,068 --> 00:49:56,378
他们得乘“船”去非洲
They're gonna get some
frequent flyer miles on the way to Africa.

553
00:49:56,537 --> 00:49:57,914
为什么是非洲？
Why Africa?

554
00:49:58,072 --> 00:50:00,348
根据你们得到的那个手机，我们跟踪到了非洲的一个机场
We pinned an airfield there
with that phone that you got,

555
00:50:00,541 --> 00:50:04,580
而且我认为谢布尔可能在那里向西边转移军火
and I think that Shabal is gonna be there
doing a weapons transfer on his way west.

556
00:50:04,745 --> 00:50:07,316
你说的西边指的是什么？墨西哥西部？
When you say "west," what are
we talking about, Mexico west?

557
00:50:07,481 --> 00:50:11,827
嗯，墨西哥西部，这是最坏的情况
Yeah, Mexico west.
That's worst-case scenario.

558
00:50:11,986 --> 00:50:13,932
你们两个和小队的其他成员在这儿待命
You two and the rest of the platoon
are gonna stay here on standby.

559
00:50:14,088 --> 00:50:15,362
如果有什么意外在美国附近发生
You'll be the primary
assault force in case

560
00:50:15,489 --> 00:50:17,332
你们将会是主要的突击力量
something goes down
anywhere near America.

561
00:50:17,491 --> 00:50:19,300
- 明白
- 明白
- Check.
- Check.

562
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:21,440
他们现身时你会来随时帮忙吗？
You gonna be around for
any questions as they come up?

563
00:50:21,595 --> 00:50:25,907
不行，伙计，克里斯多给我留下了个烂摊子，然后消失了
No, man. Christo... he pulled a Roman
Polanski on my ass and disappeared.

564
00:50:26,033 --> 00:50:27,910
我得和海豹第四分队联系
So I'm gonna link up
with SEAL Team Four,

565
00:50:28,035 --> 00:50:30,276
我们去南太平洋把他抓回来
and we're gonna go hunt his ass
down in the South Pacific.

566
00:50:30,438 --> 00:50:32,918
所以我恐怕抽不开身
So it's straight up Mai Tais
and palm trees for me, baby.

567
00:50:33,074 --> 00:50:34,018
是啊，兄弟，把他抓回来
Yeah, brother. Go get him.

568
00:50:34,175 --> 00:50:35,415
- 你保重
- 放轻松点
- You be cool.
- Take it easy.

569
00:50:35,576 --> 00:50:37,578
祝你做爸爸有好运，上尉
Good luck with that baby, Lieutenant.

570
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,092
- 每个人都知道么？
- 只有重要人物知道
- Does everybody know?
- Only the important people.

571
00:50:42,249 --> 00:50:44,627
对谁来说是重要人物？你？
The important people to who? You?

572
00:50:44,785 --> 00:50:47,425
我想是的
I guess so.

573
00:50:47,555 --> 00:50:50,536
- 我去通知兄弟们
- 等等
- I'm gonna go brief the boys.
- Hey, hold on one second.

574
00:50:52,126 --> 00:50:54,163
嘿，哥们，我以前从来没写过这些东西
Hey, brother, I've never
written one of these before.

575
00:50:55,463 --> 00:50:58,000
我保证我会保护你的
Hey, I'm tracking with you, sir. I am.

576
00:50:58,165 --> 00:50:59,769
不过，老实说
But, to be honest with you,

577
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:03,177
我曾打算报告头儿让你回家
I was thinking of calling the command
and trying to get you home.

578
00:51:03,337 --> 00:51:08,082
但现在事情变得糟糕了，我想我们需要你
But now that work's picked up so much,
I feel like we really need you here.

579
00:51:09,443 --> 00:51:10,979
你还记得我们上次在安巴尔的行动么？
（伊拉克西部省）
You remember our
last cruise to AI Anbar?

580
00:51:11,145 --> 00:51:12,988
- 嗯
- 当你在执行那个转折性的任务时
- Yeah.
- When you had that final

581
00:51:13,147 --> 00:51:15,559
你说，我不必在到场？
turnover op, and you said
I didn't need to be there?

582
00:51:15,716 --> 00:51:19,186
我当时躺在床上，一心想要回家
I was laying in bed and I realized the only
thing I needed to do now was go home.

583
00:51:19,353 --> 00:51:22,027
但是如果你们的行动失败了
But if something went south on your op,

584
00:51:22,189 --> 00:51:24,328
我会后悔我没有和你们在一起
I would always regret
not being there with you.

585
00:51:24,492 --> 00:51:26,972
我很感谢你一直这么照顾我，戴夫
I appreciate you taking care
of me big-time, Dave,

586
00:51:27,128 --> 00:51:28,801
但是我要跟队友在一起
but I'm working some things
with the brass.

587
00:51:28,963 --> 00:51:32,843
可以的话，等事情暂缓，我会休息两周
If I can, and things slow down,
I'm gonna get two weeks off.

588
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,140
我真心希望一切顺利
Well, I hope it works out
either way. I really do.

589
00:51:36,303 --> 00:51:39,512
但如果失败，我会拿着这张纸
But, if it doesn't,
I'm gonna take this piece of paper,

590
00:51:39,673 --> 00:51:41,482
把它做成一架漂亮的纸飞机
and I'm gonna make it
into a nice paper airplane.

591
00:51:41,642 --> 00:51:44,589
走吧
Beat it.

592
00:52:07,001 --> 00:52:09,072
非洲海岸

593
00:52:38,099 --> 00:52:39,976
出发！出发！
We're good, we're good!

594
00:52:49,443 --> 00:52:51,445
值更官，将潜艇下潜到160英尺
MAN: Chief of the Watch,
submerge the ship to one-six-zero feet.

595
00:52:51,612 --> 00:52:53,421
下潜，下潜
Dive. Dive.

596
00:53:05,726 --> 00:53:08,400
潜望镜已收起，舱门密封良好
OVER RADIO: Scope down.
All doors are green.

597
00:53:18,439 --> 00:53:20,077
- 伙计们
- 长官
- Oh, good. Hey, guys.
- Sir.

598
00:53:20,241 --> 00:53:21,549
- 谢谢你们这么快就赶过来
- 理所应当
- Thank you for getting here so fast.
- Sure.

599
00:53:21,742 --> 00:53:23,346
- 请坐吧
- 谢谢
- Grab a seat, please.
- Thank you.

600
00:53:23,511 --> 00:53:25,081
“斗牛犬”会在你们上空
You'll have Bulldog overhead.

601
00:53:25,647 --> 00:53:28,783
索马里
“斗牛犬”预警机

602
00:53:25,246 --> 00:53:27,248
我们需要你们潜入
We need you to get in,
grab the intel

603
00:53:27,414 --> 00:53:30,418
并带出情报，有问题么？
and bounce it back to us.
Do you have any questions?

604
00:53:30,584 --> 00:53:33,258
长官，我有问题，我们制定好了会合地点和时间
Sir, I have a question.
We have the rally point and time.

605
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:35,422
可是如果他们没按计划出现呢？
What if the meeting
doesn't take place as scheduled?

606
00:53:35,589 --> 00:53:37,830
你想让我们盯着目标多长时间呢？
How long do you
want us to stay on target?

607
00:53:37,992 --> 00:53:41,769
这个已经考虑了，所以我计划让你们多呆一会
Now, this one counts, so I'd plan
on being out there for a while.

608
00:53:41,929 --> 00:53:44,102
- 明白
- 都明白了？
- Check.
- Are we good?

609
00:53:44,265 --> 00:53:45,437
- 我想是的，长官
- 是的，长官
- Think so, sir.
- Yes, sir.

610
00:53:55,442 --> 00:53:59,117
雷和艾杰已经装备整齐，互相检查
MAN: Ray and Ajay are rigged up
and ready to check each other out.

611
00:54:00,214 --> 00:54:01,591
闸门准备就绪
OVER RADIO: Garage door clear.

612
00:54:47,027 --> 00:54:49,837
索马里

613
00:55:18,425 --> 00:55:19,927
- 你看见了么？
- 是的
- You got a visual?
- Yeah.

614
00:55:20,094 --> 00:55:21,971
看见了三辆卡车
Got three trucks moving in.

615
00:55:22,129 --> 00:55:26,100
一辆油车，两辆吉普，后面坐着非洲民兵
A fuel truck, two jeeps,
some skinnies in the back.

616
00:55:26,267 --> 00:55:27,905
有辆车装着一把12.7毫米口径重机枪
One of them has a .50-cal.

617
00:55:36,977 --> 00:55:39,184
你听见了么？
You hear that

618
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:41,553
- 嗯，我想那是我们的目标
- 是的，我们发现目标了
- Yeah, I think that's our plane.
- Yeah, we got some inbound.

619
00:55:52,393 --> 00:55:55,897
他们是时候现身了，天啊，给我相机
'Bout time these guys showed up.
Jesus. Let me get my camera.

620
00:56:12,913 --> 00:56:15,792
嘿，雷，两架飞机在机场尽头降落
Hey, Ray, we got two birds
down at the end of the field,

621
00:56:15,949 --> 00:56:21,023
在我们东南方向，没有尾翼编号
southeast our pos, no tail IDs.

622
00:56:21,188 --> 00:56:23,828
- 记下没？
- 记了，没有尾翼编号
- You got that?
- Check, no tail IDs.

623
00:56:33,033 --> 00:56:35,877
雷，我记得我们是在非洲吧
Ray, last time I checked,
we were in Africa, right?

624
00:56:36,036 --> 00:56:37,640
是啊，怎么了？
Yeah. Why, what's up?

625
00:56:39,306 --> 00:56:42,947
兄弟，看上去那儿有16个菲律宾人
Dude, there's, like,
16 Filipinos down there,

626
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:44,555
都在向麦加祈祷呢
all praying to Mecca right now.

627
00:56:44,712 --> 00:56:47,522
- 菲律宾人？
- 是的，肯定不是非洲民兵
- Filipinos?
- Filipinos. Definitely not skinnies.

628
00:56:47,681 --> 00:56:50,787
我接受他们的祈祷了，顺便接受俄国人的祈祷
I'm picking up the praying.
I'm also picking up some Russian.

629
00:56:51,326 --> 00:56:52,600
你们两个人过来

630
00:56:52,711 --> 00:56:55,800
小心照看这些箱子，听到了么？

631
00:56:56,051 --> 00:56:59,600
要是掉了一个，我们都得死

632
00:57:02,564 --> 00:57:04,440
你要换乘不同的飞机

633
00:57:05,754 --> 00:57:08,200
然后穿越两条不同的边境线

634
00:57:08,419 --> 00:57:10,100
为谨慎起见

635
00:57:11,304 --> 00:57:15,715
一旦到达岛上，你的人会有时间进行准备

636
00:57:16,116 --> 00:57:20,800
我的朋友会去接你，帮你搞定剩下的“路途”

637
00:57:21,982 --> 00:57:25,657

注意，我们侦察到两架不明飞机
Be advised, we got two sterile aircraft

640
00:57:30,357 --> 00:57:34,066
向东起飞，方位是

MAN OVER RADIO: Roger

645
00:57:43,337 --> 00:57:46,841
嘿，上士，你不会相信的
RORKE: Hey, Chief, you are
not gonna believe this.

646
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:48,418
雷和艾杰标记的一架飞机
One of the planes Ray and Ajay tagged

647
00:57:48,575 --> 00:57:50,851
刚刚降落在了墨西哥海岸的塞德罗斯岛
just landed on Cedros Island
off the coast of Mexico.

648
00:57:51,011 --> 00:57:54,015
机上坐着谢布尔和数量不明的圣战分子
It has Shabal on it with an
unknown number of jihadis.

649
00:57:54,181 --> 00:57:55,387
你在开玩笑吗？
Are you kidding me?

650
00:57:55,549 --> 00:57:57,290
不，看起来我们可以去袭击目标了
No, looks like we're gonna
get to hit that target.

651
00:57:57,451 --> 00:57:59,522
好吧，军士和河流部队特战艇出发了
Well, Senior and the SWCC
boats are punching out.

652
00:57:59,686 --> 00:58:02,394
他们应该能弄到更多情报的，等着看吧
They should pull a little more
intel for us, so we'll see.

653
00:58:02,556 --> 00:58:04,035
好的
All right.

654
00:58:06,727 --> 00:58:09,401
南太平洋

655
00:58:31,084 --> 00:58:33,997
我不知道我们得待多久，等一下，宝贝
I don't know how long we're staying.
Hold on, baby.

656
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:41,440
- 注意安全
- 你知道我会的
- Be safe.
- You know I will.

657
00:58:41,595 --> 00:58:44,075
- 我要出发了，宝贝
- 我爱你
- I gotta go, honey,
- I love you.

658
00:58:44,231 --> 00:58:46,040
我也爱你
I love you.

659
00:59:02,744 --> 00:59:05,400
乔安娜，我不想你跟那些男孩玩

660
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:07,450
你在听我说么？

661
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:13,300
好吗？好的，以后再和你聊

662
00:59:31,612 --> 00:59:33,387
A队B队，距离目标200米
MAN OVER RADIO:
Bravo Alpha, we're 200 meters out.

663
00:59:44,591 --> 00:59:46,593
B队，侦察到右舷有一名目标
Bravo, you have a Tango
on your starboard side.

664
00:59:46,793 --> 00:59:48,466
右舷有一名目标
MAN 2 OVER RADIO:
Tango on the starboard side.

665
00:59:56,737 --> 00:59:59,343
C队W队，侦察到敌方目标
MAN OVER RADIO: Whiskey Charlie,
we have a visual on Tango.

666
01:00:19,092 --> 01:00:21,368
B队，12点钟方向有埋伏
Bravo, you have a Viper at twelve o'clock.

667
01:00:50,857 --> 01:00:52,200
趴下！趴下！
Get down! Get down!

668
01:00:53,694 --> 01:00:56,197
安全！舰桥安全
Clear! Bridge secure.

669
01:00:57,798 --> 01:00:59,243
军士，可安全上船
MAN OVER RADIO:
Senior, you're clean

670
01:01:25,125 --> 01:01:27,162
下午好，你好么？

671
01:01:27,465 --> 01:01:30,500
你还好么？你还说塞尔维亚-克罗地亚语么？

672
01:01:30,731 --> 01:01:31,669
我会俄语

673
01:01:32,122 --> 01:01:32,972
你是俄罗斯人？

674
01:01:32,972 --> 01:01:33,861
是的

675
01:01:34,064 --> 01:01:35,000
我不说俄语

676
01:01:35,002 --> 01:01:37,608
- 英语可以么？开始吧
- 没问题
- English OK? Let's do that.
- English is fine.

677
01:01:37,771 --> 01:01:39,478
能给他松绑么？
Can you cut him loose, please?

678
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:41,642
如果松了绑，你不会做傻事的，对吧？
If you get cut loose, you're not
gonna do anything crazy, are you?

679
01:01:41,808 --> 01:01:44,982
所谓“疯子伊凡”
（此句出自电影《猎杀红色十月》）
A Crazy Ivan? Soto speak.

680
01:01:45,145 --> 01:01:47,455
那么你是俄国人吧，是吗？
So you're Russian, yeah?

681
01:01:47,614 --> 01:01:50,117
- 是的
- 你没事吧？
- Yes, I am.
- You all right?

682
01:01:50,283 --> 01:01:52,786
- 是的，没事，谢谢
- 不客气
- Yes, I'm good. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

683
01:01:52,953 --> 01:01:54,330
抱歉，我还不知道你的名字
I'm sorry.
I don't know your name.

684
01:01:54,488 --> 01:01:55,523
- 我是奥托
- 奥托
- I'm Otto.
- Otto.

685
01:01:55,689 --> 01:01:57,430
- 对，你呢？
- 很高兴见到你
- Yes. And you are?
- Nice to meet you.

686
01:01:57,591 --> 01:01:58,626
克里斯多
Christo.

687
01:01:58,792 --> 01:02:00,533
- 克里斯科？
- 克里斯多
- Crisco?
- Christo.

688
01:02:01,662 --> 01:02:03,471
特拉斯科维奇？
Troskawicz?

689
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:05,610
还要跟你混多久才能
So how long am I gonna need
to keep busting your balls

690
01:02:05,766 --> 01:02:07,871
得到一块这种补丁？
about getting one of those patches?

691
01:02:08,035 --> 01:02:10,311
啊，我想不会再有了
Ah, yeah, I think it was,
like, a one-time deal, man.

692
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:13,314
911之后，我叔叔给我们队送了一堆
After 9/11, my uncle sent
a bunch out for the platoon,

693
01:02:13,473 --> 01:02:16,454
不过这次行动后，我会把它给你
but, uh, after this go-round,
I'll give it to you.

694
01:02:16,610 --> 01:02:18,453
不，不，我不会拿你的家族饰品
No, no, I'm not gonna
take your family crest.

695
01:02:18,578 --> 01:02:21,115
好吧，其实我也不想给你
All right, good.
I didn't want to give it to you anyway.

696
01:02:21,281 --> 01:02:23,124
除此之外，我很确定我看见
Besides, man,
I'm pretty sure I saw you

697
01:02:23,283 --> 01:02:25,194
几天前你把什么东西放到了你的口袋里
putting something in your
cargo pocket the other day.

698
01:02:25,352 --> 01:02:28,993
- 那是什么？
- 我知道我见过你那个
- What's that?
- I know I've seen you carrying

699
01:02:29,156 --> 01:02:30,863
口袋里装了什么东西
something in that pocket right there.

700
01:02:32,392 --> 01:02:33,496
是什么？
What is it?

701
01:02:34,795 --> 01:02:35,967
这是我祖父的旗子
That's my grandfather's flag.

702
01:02:36,129 --> 01:02:37,699
- 真棒
- 我爸爸把他给了我
- Nice.
- My pop gave it to me,

703
01:02:37,864 --> 01:02:39,502
哪天我会把它给我的孩子
and now I'm gonna
give it to my boy someday.

704
01:02:39,666 --> 01:02:41,668
棒极了，我喜欢
All right. I like that.

705
01:02:51,578 --> 01:02:53,148
你在一艘很漂亮的船上
You're sitting on a wonderful boat.

706
01:02:53,313 --> 01:02:54,451
- 它很豪华
- 没错，谢谢
- It's fabulous.
- Thank you. Yes.

707
01:02:54,648 --> 01:02:56,924
- 我觉得它叫“星际飞船”
- “星际飞船”
- I believe it's called Starship.
- "Starship,"

708
01:02:57,084 --> 01:02:58,427
我喜欢你说“星际飞船”的方式
I love the way you say Starship.

709
01:02:58,585 --> 01:03:01,088
听上去像俄语，像一个《星际迷航》里的人
It's like Russian.
That guy, uh... Star Trek.

710
01:03:01,254 --> 01:03:03,359
叫什么来着，斯科蒂？哦，不，对不起，斯科特
What's his name, Scotty?
Oh, no, he was, sorry, Scott.

711
01:03:03,523 --> 01:03:05,867
- 我不知道
- 你从没看过《星际迷航》？
- I wouldn't Know.
- Yes. You've never seen Star Trek?

712
01:03:06,026 --> 01:03:07,699
- 没
- 你“疯”了
- No.
- Oh, that's insane.

713
01:03:07,861 --> 01:03:09,340
- 问题是这样的，伙计
- 嗯？
- So here's the problem, pal.
- Mm-hm?

714
01:03:09,496 --> 01:03:11,533
你身价很高
You're worth a lot of money.

715
01:03:11,698 --> 01:03:14,872
- 或者说你曾经身价很高
- 我相信我现在也是
- Or you were worth a lot of money.
- I believe I still am.

716
01:03:15,035 --> 01:03:16,173
- 是么？
- 没错
- You do?
- Yes.

717
01:03:16,336 --> 01:03:20,045
好吧，让我告诉你这个世界是怎么运转的吧，克里斯科
All right. Let me tell you
how the world works there, Crisco.

718
01:03:20,207 --> 01:03:21,743
- 是克里斯多
- 什么？
- It's Christo.
- Sorry?

719
01:03:21,908 --> 01:03:23,546
- 克里斯多
- 哦，当然了，抱歉
- Christo.
- Oh, of course. Sorry.

720
01:03:23,710 --> 01:03:24,950
没事
It's OK.

721
01:03:25,112 --> 01:03:26,523
让我来告诉你这世界是怎么运转的
Let me tell you
how the world really works.

722
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:27,886
- 请吧
- 这不再是你的船了
- Please.
- This is no longer your boat.

723
01:03:28,048 --> 01:03:31,188
从我穿过那扇门之后，你再也不是原来的你了
Since I walked through that door,
you're not the same guy you used to be.

724
01:03:31,351 --> 01:03:34,560
就是这样的，我也没法阻止
You're just not.
There's nothing I can do to stop that,

725
01:03:34,721 --> 01:03:37,702
我帮不了你，除非你让我帮你
nothing I can do to help you right now,
unless you let me help you.

726
01:03:37,858 --> 01:03:41,396
我们需要共渡难关，兄弟，你和我
We need to do this together, pal.
You and me.

727
01:03:41,561 --> 01:03:45,270
跟伊斯兰圣战分子共事感觉如何？
So how is it that you're working
with these jihadi folks, then?

728
01:03:47,033 --> 01:03:48,034
你是犹太人，对么？
You're Jewish, right?

729
01:03:50,103 --> 01:03:52,208
谢布尔是什么？
Shabal is what?

730
01:03:54,574 --> 01:03:57,418
- 你有没有跟你一起长大的朋友？
- 什么？
- You got a friend, like, you grew up with?
- Sorry?

731
01:03:57,577 --> 01:03:59,454
你有跟你一起长大的朋友吗？
Have you ever had a friend
that you grew up with?

732
01:03:59,613 --> 01:04:01,820
- 是的
- 有共同的兴趣，都踢足球
- Yes.
- Had, like, played interests, played soccer,

733
01:04:01,982 --> 01:04:03,825
或是...你们玩的什么，可能是棒球，对吧？
or... What would you play?
Baseball, probably, right?

734
01:04:03,984 --> 01:04:05,486
- 可能吧
- 是的
- Probably. Yeah.
- Yeah.

735
01:04:05,652 --> 01:04:06,995
后来大家各奔前程
And then you went
on your separate ways,

736
01:04:07,154 --> 01:04:09,964
数年后再遇见时
and then some years later,
you meet up.

737
01:04:10,123 --> 01:04:13,536
你完全认不出他来了
And you totally
didn't recognize the person.

738
01:04:13,727 --> 01:04:15,729
这就是我和谢布尔的故事
And that's what happened with Shabal.

739
01:04:15,896 --> 01:04:18,502
我们有共同的爱好
We share a common interest.

740
01:04:18,665 --> 01:04:22,909
因为宗教信仰，他突然有了不可思议的想法
So he came up with this incredible idea
because of his beliefs.

741
01:04:23,069 --> 01:04:27,347
我不必跟他有一样的信仰，但他是个聪明人
I don't necessarily share his beliefs,
but he's a smart guy.

742
01:04:27,507 --> 01:04:29,509
知道吗，就好像...
You know, it's almost like...

743
01:04:29,676 --> 01:04:31,280
就好像...
...you know, it's almost like...

744
01:04:31,444 --> 01:04:32,582
这就是我
...like this is me.

745
01:04:38,418 --> 01:04:41,024
- 这就是谢布尔
- 是吗？
- And that's Shabal.
- Is it?

746
01:04:41,188 --> 01:04:43,168
- 中间是美国人
- 是么？
- And America is in-between.
- Is it?

747
01:04:43,323 --> 01:04:44,358
没错
Yeah.

748
01:04:45,926 --> 01:04:47,166
很酷的理论吧？
Cool concept, no?

749
01:04:47,327 --> 01:04:48,829
- 在这里？
- 是的
- Right here?
- Yes.

750
01:04:50,297 --> 01:04:52,334
你认为这是游戏?
You think this is some kind of game?

751
01:04:54,835 --> 01:04:56,815
- 是吗？你觉得这很好笑么？
- 不，不
- Do you? Do you find this amusing?
- No. No.

752
01:04:56,970 --> 01:04:58,950
- 我没觉得
- 你知道自己在这做什么吗？
- I'm not finding...
- Do you realize what you're doing here?

753
01:04:59,739 --> 01:05:02,151

01:05:02,309 --> 01:05:04,653
目标B已清除
Post nation counterpart.
Secured target Bravo.

755
01:05:04,811 --> 01:05:07,917
通告全队，可以安全前往目标A
Report to Tri-Hull.
You're clear to move on target Alpha.

756
01:05:08,114 --> 01:05:10,788
收到基地，朝目标行进中
MAN 2 OVER RADIO: Roger, Main.
Clear to target.

757
01:05:14,087 --> 01:05:17,364
我只会向我的家人坦白
The only people
I answer to is my family.

758
01:05:17,524 --> 01:05:19,800
向我的妻子和我的孩子
To my wife and to my child.

759
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:22,031
除此之外，别无他人
And nobody else.

760
01:05:22,195 --> 01:05:25,335
- 你赶时间么？
- 不想再听你说废话了
- Running late somewhere?
- Shit filter's full.

761
01:05:25,498 --> 01:05:26,670
- 真的？
- 是的
- Really?
- Yeah.

762
01:05:26,833 --> 01:05:30,246
问题是这样的，兄弟
So here's the problem, pal.

763
01:05:30,403 --> 01:05:32,246
你爱你的家人，对吧？
You do love your family, don't you?

764
01:05:33,406 --> 01:05:35,511
- 是的
- 那你的女儿呢？
- Yes, I do.
- And what about your daughter?

765
01:05:35,675 --> 01:05:37,086
我的女儿？
What about my daughter?

766
01:05:37,244 --> 01:05:39,087
你还想再看到她么？
Are you looking forward
to seeing her again?

767
01:05:39,246 --> 01:05:40,919
无时无刻都想见
Every minute of my life.

768
01:06:03,770 --> 01:06:08,185
我让你看这个是想让你好好考虑下
I wanted you to see that so that you'd
think about some things very seriously,

769
01:06:08,341 --> 01:06:10,878
因为你会被关进某个“笼子”
because you're gonna be
sitting in a box somewhere.

770
01:06:11,044 --> 01:06:14,856
你会得到妥善和人道的待遇
You'll be treated properly
and humanely.

771
01:06:16,516 --> 01:06:20,794
这个女孩将会长大，结婚
That girl is gonna grow up,
and she's gonna get married,

772
01:06:20,954 --> 01:06:24,197
你老婆也会再嫁他人
and your wife is gonna find someone else,

773
01:06:24,357 --> 01:06:27,270
你会错过一切的
and you're gonna miss everything.

774
01:06:34,467 --> 01:06:37,914
如果我做了什么让家人置身危险的事
If I had done something
that would endanger my family,

775
01:06:38,071 --> 01:06:40,210
我会跟你现在有同样的想法
I would feel just
like you do right now.

776
01:06:43,076 --> 01:06:44,987
你能保证不碰我家人吗？
You promise not
to touch my family?

777
01:06:45,145 --> 01:06:47,056
我绝不会碰你家人
I would never touch your family.

778
01:06:48,381 --> 01:06:49,451
我不会
I would not.

779
01:06:56,656 --> 01:06:57,999
你对
Are you familiar with...

780
01:07:00,393 --> 01:07:01,929
陶瓷球熟悉么？
...ceramic ball bearings?

781
01:07:02,095 --> 01:07:03,472
不
No.

782
01:07:04,631 --> 01:07:06,838
想象一下，16件
Just imagine 16 suicide vests

783
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,071
装有陶瓷球的自爆背心
filled with those
ceramic ball bearings,

784
01:07:09,235 --> 01:07:13,741
通过金属探测仪和美国所有检查站
slipping by every metal detector
and every checkpoint in your country.

785
01:07:15,308 --> 01:07:17,754
现在能想象到经济崩溃了吗？
You think your economy
is fucked now?

786
01:07:19,179 --> 01:07:23,093
想象下媒体会怎么应对这事
Just think what the media
is gonna do with this. Hm?

787
01:07:23,249 --> 01:07:26,560
这会使911事件变得微不足道
It's gonna make 9/11 look like
a fucking walk in the park.

788
01:07:26,753 --> 01:07:28,664
就像在中央公园里散步一样
The grand Central Park.

789
01:07:29,956 --> 01:07:31,697
你这是在告诉我
So you're telling me...

790
01:07:32,859 --> 01:07:38,866
会有16个圣战分子穿着自爆背心
...there's 16 jihadis
wearing suicide vests.

791
01:07:39,199 --> 01:07:42,442
大摇大摆穿越边境
They're gonna walk
right across the border.

792
01:07:43,536 --> 01:07:45,072
那他们的目的地是哪里？
So where are they going?

793
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:49,719
圣地亚哥, 旧金山,休斯顿
San Diego, San Francisco, Houston...

794
01:07:49,876 --> 01:07:51,617
随你选，到处都有
You pick a city, they'll be there.

795
01:07:51,778 --> 01:07:56,022
- 这就是现在的事态么？
- 我们说话时它就在发生着
- And this is happening now?
- It's happening as we speak.

796
01:07:56,983 --> 01:07:58,291
什么？
Sorry, what?

797
01:07:59,352 --> 01:08:01,855
现在它就在发生着，就在我们说话的时候
It's happening as we speak.

798
01:08:04,290 --> 01:08:06,167
你怎么才能阻止？
(SIGHS) How can you stop this?

799
01:08:08,628 --> 01:08:10,198
我不能
I can't.

800
01:08:11,865 --> 01:08:16,075
赛德罗斯岛，墨西哥

801
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:03,583
黑胡，后援队已就位
Blackbeard Lead,
containment element is set.

802
01:10:03,743 --> 01:10:04,915
明白
Roger.

803
01:11:39,706 --> 01:11:42,277
卡洛斯, 门口有人！
救命！救命！

804
01:11:44,277 --> 01:11:45,915
开火！开火！开火！
Gun! Gun! Gun!

805
01:11:47,714 --> 01:11:49,921
- 安全！
- Clear!

806
01:11:50,083 --> 01:11:51,061
- 走
- 我们走！
- Go.
- Coming out!

807
01:11:55,288 --> 01:11:59,065
鼠帮，我是黑胡，我们在中心地带，即教堂南部与敌军交火
Rat Pack, this is Blackbeard. We're in
contact, midtown, south of the church.

808
01:12:08,635 --> 01:12:10,546
接敌！
Contact!

809
01:12:25,051 --> 01:12:26,587
接敌！
Contact!

810
01:12:30,089 --> 01:12:30,931
更换弹药！
Changing!

811
01:12:37,096 --> 01:12:38,973
黑胡，你的方位是什么？
Blackbeard Lead, what's your pos?

812
01:12:39,132 --> 01:12:41,112
掩护我, 你可自由射击
RORKE OVER RADIO: Overwatch.
You're clear to engage.

813
01:12:42,268 --> 01:12:43,303
开火！
Go in hot.

814
01:13:05,091 --> 01:13:06,627
小心手雷！
Frag out!

815
01:13:15,968 --> 01:13:19,142
怀明，我看到两个目标正开车向南逃窜
Weimy, I've got two squilters
heading south in a pickup truck.

816
01:13:23,876 --> 01:13:24,877
我看见了
I see 'em.

817
01:13:29,282 --> 01:13:31,023
狠狠揍卡车里那两个家伙
Hit those two guys in the truck.

818
01:13:52,205 --> 01:13:53,343
火箭弹！
Rocket!

819
01:14:01,414 --> 01:14:02,688
小心手雷！
Frag out!

820
01:15:02,742 --> 01:15:04,744
长官？长官？
Sir? Sir?

821
01:15:04,911 --> 01:15:07,619
上尉？你没事吧？
LT? You all right?

822
01:15:13,686 --> 01:15:14,687
妈的
Damn.

823
01:15:14,887 --> 01:15:16,662
这玩意救了你一命，是吧？
You check that box, huh?

824
01:15:16,823 --> 01:15:18,131
嗯
Yeah.

825
01:15:19,992 --> 01:15:21,630
幸运的是那是颗哑弹，本来我应该受伤的
Good thing that was a dud.
I might've gotten hurt.

826
01:15:21,794 --> 01:15:24,934
- 是啊
- 哇哦
- Yeah.
- Whoa.

827
01:15:27,233 --> 01:15:28,576
天啊
Jesus.

828
01:15:31,938 --> 01:15:35,147
这可不是伊拉克手工作坊那种劣质自爆背心
This is not some bush-league
vest from an Iraqi hut.

829
01:15:35,308 --> 01:15:36,651
它装着高速弹丸
This is some high-speed shit.

830
01:15:38,110 --> 01:15:40,522
我们或许该把它放到别的地方，是吧？
Maybe we should put this
somewhere else, huh?

831
01:15:48,488 --> 01:15:50,661
桑尼, 把这放到别的地方，好吗？
Hey, Sonny, find somewhere
to put this, would you?

832
01:15:57,463 --> 01:16:00,273
目标安全! 设置警戒区！
Target secure.
Set security.

833
01:16:00,433 --> 01:16:02,845
一个去北面，3个去南面
One's to the north, three south.

834
01:16:12,011 --> 01:16:15,549
这是你们的目标

835
01:16:47,947 --> 01:16:49,358
嘿，上士，目标搞定了
Hey, Chief, target's buttoned up.

836
01:16:49,515 --> 01:16:51,517
- 一切都安全了
- 谢谢，兄弟
- Everything's secure.
- Thanks, man.

837
01:16:51,684 --> 01:16:54,665
黑胡，任务并未完成，请待命
WOMAN OVER RADIO.' Actual, mission
not complete. Stand by for follow-on.

838
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:56,663
你只解决了一半的恐怖分子
You only got half that jihadist cell.

839
01:16:56,822 --> 01:16:59,996
- 目标安全，长官
- 行动还没结束
- The target's secure, sir.
- This fight isn't over yet.

840
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:03,003
听着，另一半的恐怖分子在7点时
Now, listen, the other half of that cell
is gonna be crossing the border

841
01:17:03,162 --> 01:17:06,473
会从墨西卡利利用地下通道穿过国界
（墨西哥下加利福尼亚州的首府）
using a tunnel network
from Mexicali at 0700.

842
01:17:06,632 --> 01:17:09,203
正和州政府协调中，不过直升机会先把你们送到城市外围
We're coordinating with State,
but for now the birds will drop you off

843
01:17:09,368 --> 01:17:12,645
接头人是指挥官佩卓斯
outside the city where your POC
is a Commander Pedros.

844
01:17:12,805 --> 01:17:14,580
路上我会给你更多的细节
I 'll give you more details en route.

845
01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:16,879
- 黑胡，收到没？
- 收到，基地
- Actual, how do you copy?
- Roger, Main.

846
01:17:17,043 --> 01:17:19,045
好的，甲板上有接送我们的直升机
OK, we've got a helo
landing on the deck,

847
01:17:19,211 --> 01:17:21,350
我们将跟墨西哥特种部队及其指挥官碰面
we're gonna meet a Mexican
SOF commander and his team.

848
01:17:21,514 --> 01:17:24,358
他们会帮我们渗透目标并参与突击
They're gonna help infil us to
the target and join us on the assault.

849
01:17:25,585 --> 01:17:27,724
- 你究竟在说什么？
- 我们还没有完全消灭他们，上士
- What the hell are you talking about?
- We haven't got all of 'em yet, Chief.

850
01:17:27,887 --> 01:17:30,959
- 剩下的在哪儿？
- 他们在墨西卡利边境上
- And where's the rest of 'em?
- They're in Mexicali on the border.

851
01:17:31,123 --> 01:17:32,761
好的，那剩下的人
All right.
And the rest of the boys,

852
01:17:32,925 --> 01:17:34,063
怎么回船上去？
how are they getting
back to the ship?

853
01:17:34,226 --> 01:17:35,534
好人理查号会继续待命
Bon Homme Richard
stayed on station.

854
01:17:35,695 --> 01:17:37,606
他们会派出一支陆战小队去帮助清理战场
They're gonna send in a Marine
element to help exploit the target.

855
01:17:37,763 --> 01:17:40,039
完事后剩下的人会跟他们一起走
When they're done, the boys
will pull off with them.

856
01:17:40,199 --> 01:17:43,112
好的.我在想让一小队和我去执行任务
OK. I'm thinking Squad One
and myself roll out.

857
01:17:43,269 --> 01:17:44,976
很好，二小队在这里驻守
Perfect. Squad Two
stays here, buttons it up,

858
01:17:45,137 --> 01:17:46,912
- 和陆战队一起撤退
- 没问题
- pulls out with the Marines.
- OK.

859
01:17:53,312 --> 01:17:55,121
在日出之前我们
We're moving north
of here through town,

860
01:17:55,281 --> 01:17:56,851
从这里向北穿过镇子
and crossing at sunrise.

861
01:17:57,016 --> 01:17:59,792
另一组会在几天内到达德克萨斯
The other group will get
into Texas the following day,

862
01:17:59,952 --> 01:18:01,397
通过华瑞兹市（墨西哥）
through Juarez.

863
01:18:02,655 --> 01:18:04,157
明白吗？
Comprendes ?

864
01:18:16,068 --> 01:18:20,016
嘿，长官,！到底谁下令派我们去墨西卡利的？
Hey, sir! Who the hell cleared us hot
to go to Mexicali anyway?

865
01:18:20,172 --> 01:18:22,379
是高层的命令
This one's going all
the way up the flagpole.

866
01:18:22,541 --> 01:18:24,179
国务院决定的
State Department's on it.

867
01:18:34,353 --> 01:18:37,000
美墨边界

868
01:19:03,182 --> 01:19:05,753
嘿，长官，2号频道
Hey, sir. Channel two.

869
01:19:10,823 --> 01:19:12,564
嘿，如果任务还是没完没了
Hey, this tempo keeps up like this,

870
01:19:12,725 --> 01:19:15,296
那杰姬得自己想法生孩子了
Jackie's gonna be squeezing
that kid out on her own.

871
01:19:16,362 --> 01:19:18,501
不过如果我们迅速完成任务
However, we hit this target quick enough,

872
01:19:18,631 --> 01:19:20,872
你就能骑驴回家了
you jump on a burro
and ride that shit home.

873
01:19:21,033 --> 01:19:24,537
我可不需要一只驴子
Hey, I ain't gonna need no burro.

874
01:19:26,072 --> 01:19:27,415
你拿到2周假期了？
Did you get your two weeks?

875
01:19:27,573 --> 01:19:29,849
卫星电话不是白打的
All that time I was
spending on the sat phone,

876
01:19:30,009 --> 01:19:32,285
我不是求上面让我回家
it wasn't to convince them
to let me go home,

877
01:19:32,445 --> 01:19:34,550
而是求他们让你负责任务
it was to convince them
to leave your ass in charge.

878
01:19:56,068 --> 01:19:59,500
美墨边界

879
01:20:42,281 --> 01:20:44,420
- 长官
- 上尉
- Sir.
- Lieutenant.

880
01:20:44,583 --> 01:20:46,722
看起来政府为了促成这事做了很大努力，是吧?
Seems our governments have been
very busy to make this possible, huh?

881
01:20:46,886 --> 01:20:48,297
我听说是最高层决定的
All the way to the top,
from what I hear.

882
01:20:48,454 --> 01:20:50,331
有些事情你必须明白
There is something
that you have to understand.

883
01:20:50,489 --> 01:20:54,301
我的上司很害怕事情演变成墨西哥版的“黑鹰坠落”
（请参见电影《黑鹰坠落》）
My superiors, they're very
fearful of a Mexican Mogadishu.

884
01:20:54,460 --> 01:20:56,531
他们的要求就是不能派黑鹰去
No Black Hawk Down
is what they're saying,

885
01:20:56,729 --> 01:20:58,299
所以我们要小心行事
so we do need
to stay under the radar.

886
01:20:58,464 --> 01:21:00,444
- 完全明白，长官
- 好的
- I understand completely, sir.
- Good.

887
01:21:00,599 --> 01:21:03,443
我很感谢你们来帮忙，但是我们时间不多
Your team's presence here is greatly
appreciated, but we are out of time.

888
01:21:03,602 --> 01:21:05,104
- 得马上行动
- 告诉我地点，我们就出发
- We need to move.
- Tell me where, we go.

889
01:21:05,271 --> 01:21:06,306
帮我整合这些信息
Help piece this together for me.

890
01:21:06,472 --> 01:21:07,780
- 没问题
- 我们的情报显示
- OK.
- Our intel says

891
01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:10,614
他们会使用地下通道，在“制奶厂”下面
they're using a tunnel network
that is under a milk factory.

892
01:21:10,776 --> 01:21:12,756
这对你来说意味什么？
This mean anything to you?

893
01:21:12,878 --> 01:21:15,324
我知道确切位置，离这里不远
I know exactly where that is.
It's not far from here.

894
01:21:15,481 --> 01:21:17,154
那就是我们的目的地
Then that's where we're going.

895
01:21:17,316 --> 01:21:19,125
这或许是整个墨西卡利
Of all of the places in Mexicali

896
01:21:19,285 --> 01:21:21,287
最糟糕的地方了
that you could have picked,
this is probably the worst.

897
01:21:21,453 --> 01:21:23,455
贩毒集团控制着这个地区的各个角落
The cartels control
that area from all angles.

898
01:21:23,622 --> 01:21:25,295
他们火力强大
They have us heavily outgunned.

899
01:21:25,457 --> 01:21:27,664
单是接近目标就很艰难
Simply reaching your target
is gonna be very difficult.

900
01:21:27,827 --> 01:21:30,398
长官，有8个“外国公民”正要进入我们国家
Sir, we have eight foreign nationals
heading to our country.

901
01:21:30,563 --> 01:21:32,941
无需多说，他们肯定不喜欢美国人
Needless to say,
they are no big fan of ours.

902
01:21:33,098 --> 01:21:35,271
如果他们在那里，那就是我们的目的地
If they are at that factory,
that's where we're going.

903
01:21:35,401 --> 01:21:37,574
上尉，我会带你去任何你要去的地方
Lieutenant, I'll take you
anywhere you need to go,

904
01:21:37,736 --> 01:21:40,740
但是，让你的部下准备进行比想象中还激烈的战斗吧
but prepare your men for a bigger fight
than what you had imagined.

905
01:21:40,940 --> 01:21:44,114
你不仅仅是和8个人作战，更是和他们背后的贩毒集团作战
You're not fighting eight men. You're also
fighting the cartel that's protecting them.

906
01:21:44,276 --> 01:21:46,517
如果目标进入了地下通道
If your targets make it
into those tunnels,

907
01:21:46,679 --> 01:21:48,681
那他们会像幽灵一样消失
they'll disappear like ghosts.

908
01:23:31,083 --> 01:23:32,824
你从这里进入通道
You enter the tunnels right here.

909
01:23:32,985 --> 01:23:35,124
你需要步行七英里到达交叉口
You will walk
seven miles to this fork.

910
01:23:35,287 --> 01:23:36,857
我的人会告诉你该去哪个隧道
My men will tell you
what tunnel to take.

911
01:23:37,056 --> 01:23:41,562
当你到了那里，我的任务就完成了
Once you get to this point,
my job is done.

912
01:23:41,694 --> 01:23:43,503
到时候就靠自己了
You're on your own.

913
01:24:12,157 --> 01:24:14,933
- 上尉，我们要进去了！
- 明白
- Lieutenant, we're going now!
- Roger that.

914
01:24:36,648 --> 01:24:40,619
上士, 不要停下，我们要冲进去
Chief, we're not stopping.
We're rolling up on target, hard.

915
01:24:40,786 --> 01:24:43,392
明白，长官，30秒准备
Roger that, sir.
We're about 30 seconds out.

916
01:24:57,870 --> 01:25:00,874
距南边入口一分钟
RORKE OVER RADIO: One mike out
from the south entrance.

917
01:25:35,808 --> 01:25:37,515
老大！在房顶上！
Jefe! On the roof!

918
01:25:49,188 --> 01:25:51,134
我们得走了，快！
We gotta go. Now.

919
01:26:08,974 --> 01:26:10,146
我们走

920
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:11,603
你待在这里

921
01:26:23,422 --> 01:26:26,301
长官！留两个人在这！
Sir! Leave two men here!

922
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:50,159
准备好，他们来了！

923
01:26:55,020 --> 01:26:56,021
怀明！
Weimy!

924
01:26:59,858 --> 01:27:00,859
怀明！
Weimy!

925
01:27:02,094 --> 01:27:03,198
我要你把这些混蛋搞定！
I need you
to lock this shit down!

926
01:27:12,004 --> 01:27:13,278
小心手雷！
Frag out!

927
01:27:15,774 --> 01:27:16,980
跟着我
On me.

928
01:27:42,801 --> 01:27:44,747
你们去那边的门！
You guys got the gate!

929
01:27:44,903 --> 01:27:47,474
卡尔！你去前门！
Call! You're going to the front door!

930
01:27:50,042 --> 01:27:51,578
上!
Go!

931
01:28:18,904 --> 01:28:20,212
卡尔！
Call!

932
01:29:10,989 --> 01:29:12,229
更换弹药！
Changing!

933
01:29:57,936 --> 01:30:00,439
炸弹！
Bomb!

934
01:30:27,499 --> 01:30:29,479
我们干嘛停下？

935
01:30:52,991 --> 01:30:54,095
该死的，长官
Damn it, sir.

936
01:30:54,259 --> 01:30:55,602
我要怎么跟家里人解释啊？
How you gonna explain
that one to my family?

937
01:30:55,761 --> 01:30:58,105
退回去就不用解释这事了，是吧？
Get back there
so I don't have to, huh?

938
01:31:14,413 --> 01:31:15,687
安全！
Clear!

939
01:31:38,236 --> 01:31:40,477
小心手雷！
Grenade!

940
01:32:38,530 --> 01:32:41,033
上尉！
LT!

941
01:32:44,703 --> 01:32:46,011
上士，我来帮他
Chief, I got him.

942
01:33:08,994 --> 01:33:10,667
继续行动，我来掩护你
Keep going. I'll cover you.

943
01:33:10,829 --> 01:33:11,830
快进隧道

944
01:34:58,003 --> 01:34:59,243
上士
Chief.

945
01:35:03,808 --> 01:35:06,652
上士！
Chief!

946
01:35:09,247 --> 01:35:11,420
突击2队，我是突击1队
SONNY (ECHOING): Assault Two,
this is Assault One.

947
01:35:11,583 --> 01:35:15,725
注意，地下通道已安全，所有目标已击毙
Be advised, tunnel is secure
and all threats are neutralized.

948
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:18,093
上尉和上士倒下了
LT and Chief are down.

949
01:35:18,256 --> 01:35:21,260
重复一遍, 上尉和上士倒下了
OVER RADIO: I say again,
LT and Chief are down,

950
01:36:17,816 --> 01:36:19,693
你父亲是个好男人
DA VE.' Your father was a good man.

951
01:36:19,851 --> 01:36:22,263
幼年丧父会让你感到艰辛
Growing up without him
is gonna be hard.

952
01:36:22,420 --> 01:36:24,422
感到痛苦
It's gonna hurt.

953
01:36:24,589 --> 01:36:28,560
感到孤独，感觉迷失了“海岸线”
You'll feel alone, out to sea,
with no shore in sight.

954
01:36:28,727 --> 01:36:32,732
你会纳闷“为什么是我？我什么是我的父亲？”
You'll wooden
"Why me? Why him?"

955
01:36:44,375 --> 01:36:48,790
但请记住，你血管里流淌着勇士的鲜血
Remember, you have
warrior's blood in your veins.

956
01:36:48,947 --> 01:36:51,894
造就你父亲的“准则”
The code that made your father
who he was is the same code

957
01:36:52,050 --> 01:36:55,793
也将同样使你变成他所尊敬的男子汉
that'll make you a man
he would admire, respect.

958
01:36:57,255 --> 01:37:00,600
把你的悲伤放进“盒子”里，锁起来
Put your pain in a box.
Lock it down.

959
01:37:00,759 --> 01:37:03,797
正如你父亲所钟爱的绘画里的人物
Like those people in the
paintings your father liked,

960
01:37:03,962 --> 01:37:08,536
我们也是由各要素“组成”的
we are men made up of boxes,
chambers of loss and triumph,

961
01:37:08,666 --> 01:37:12,045
损失、胜利、伤痛、希望和爱
of hurt and hope and love.

962
01:37:13,138 --> 01:37:15,778
- 没有人比能够驾驭情绪和
- 准备！
- No one is stronger or more dangerous...
- Ready!

963
01:37:15,940 --> 01:37:17,647
- 面对过去的人更坚强
- 瞄准！
- ...Than a man who can harness emotions.
- Aim!

964
01:37:17,809 --> 01:37:20,221
- 或更强大
- His past.

965
01:37:21,579 --> 01:37:24,253
- 瞄准！
- Aim!

966
01:37:25,583 --> 01:37:27,824
- 瞄准！
- Aim!

967
01:37:30,288 --> 01:37:33,235
望你能以此作为动力，作为激励
DA VE.' Use it as fuel,
as ammunition,

968
01:37:33,358 --> 01:37:36,896
作为书写生命华美篇章之墨
as ink to write the most
important letter of your life.

969
01:37:38,329 --> 01:37:41,401
我谨代表美国总统
On behalf of the President
of the United States

970
01:37:41,533 --> 01:37:45,675
和这满怀感激之情国家，授予你这面国旗
and a grateful nation,
I present you this flag

971
01:37:45,837 --> 01:37:49,148
以此纪念你的丈夫的英雄事迹
in recognition of your
husband's heroic achievements.

972
01:37:53,144 --> 01:37:55,647
对此，我表示最深刻的哀悼
You have my
deepest condolences.

973
01:38:00,485 --> 01:38:02,863
还有一面旗帜要交予你
One more flag to present.

974
01:38:03,021 --> 01:38:05,433
我想你认识这个
This one I think you know.

975
01:38:06,925 --> 01:38:11,101
每次行动，洛克都会带着它
On every deployment,
Rorke carried this with him.

976
01:38:15,099 --> 01:38:17,602
再一次表达我最深刻的哀悼
Again, my deepest condolences.

977
01:38:26,444 --> 01:38:29,050
上尉！恩格尔！
Lieutenant Engel!

978
01:38:29,214 --> 01:38:31,854
呼拉，上尉，恩格尔！
ALL: Hoo-yah, Lieutenant Engel!

979
01:39:37,482 --> 01:39:41,726
你父亲临死前让我转达你一首图康萨的诗
（图康萨，美国印第安萧尼族酋长，领导印第安人结成同盟抵御欧洲殖民者）
DA VE.' Before he died, your father asked
me to give you this poem by Tecumseh.

980
01:39:41,886 --> 01:39:44,867
我告诉他我会把它写下来，折成纸飞机
I told him I 'd fold it
into a paper airplane.

981
01:39:45,023 --> 01:39:47,765
我想我也是这么做的
And, in a way,
I guess that's what I'm doing,

982
01:39:47,926 --> 01:39:51,066
以下是他想告诉你的：
sailing it from him to you.

983
01:39:54,365 --> 01:39:56,208
永远不可让内心屈服于
Live your life
that the fear of death

984
01:39:56,367 --> 01:39:58,540
死亡的恐惧
Can never enter your heart

985
01:39:58,703 --> 01:40:01,047
不可干涉别人的信仰
Trouble no one about his religion

986
01:40:01,172 --> 01:40:03,243
尊重他人及其观点
Respect others and their views

987
01:40:03,408 --> 01:40:06,048
同时也请他们尊重你
And demand they respect yours

988
01:40:06,210 --> 01:40:09,282
热爱生命，诠释生命
Love your life, perfect your life

989
01:40:09,447 --> 01:40:12,223
让你生命中的一切都变得美好
Beautify all things in your life

990
01:40:12,383 --> 01:40:16,889
在有限的生命中坚持为民众服务
RORKE.' Seek to make your life long
and of service to your people

991
01:40:17,055 --> 01:40:18,966
当你生命走向终点时
When your time comes to die

992
01:40:19,123 --> 01:40:22,570
别像其他人那样内心充满死亡恐惧
Be not like those whose hearts
are filled with fear of death

993
01:40:22,694 --> 01:40:24,901
他们在临死前会哭泣，会祈求上天
So that when their time comes
they weep and pray

994
01:40:25,063 --> 01:40:28,875
再给自己多一点时间去体验完全不同的人生
For a little more time to live their lives
over again in a different way

995
01:40:29,067 --> 01:40:30,978
你应吟着死亡之歌迎接终结
Sing your death song

996
01:40:31,135 --> 01:40:34,139
要像个勇士
――归家的勇士――
And die like a hero going home

997
01:40:40,886 --> 01:40:47,343

J' AH I saw was smoke and fire

1006
01:42:46,737 --> 01:42:49,513
J' I didn't feel a thing

1007
01:42:51,242 --> 01:42:54,553
J' But suddenly I was rising higher

1008

about my unborn child

01:43:12,130 --> 01:43:14,508
J' From somewhere up above

1014
01:43:14,665 --> 01:43:17,145
J' No greater gift has man

1015
01:43:17,301 --> 01:43:21,579
J' Than to la y down his life for love

1016
01:43:23,908 --> 01:43:25,581
J' And I wonder

1017
01:43:25,743 --> 01:43:28,189
J' Would I give my life?

1018
01:43:30,648 --> 01:43:34,186
J' Could I make that sacrifice?

1019
01:43:36,354 --> 01:43:38,925
J' If it came down to it
Couldl take the bullet?

1020
01:43:39,090 --> 01:43:44,199
J' I would
Yes, I would

1021
01:43:44,362 --> 01:43:45,932
J' For you

1022
01:43:49,834 --> 01:43:52,041
J' Mm-hm

1023
01:43:56,774 --> 01:43:59,345
J' Maybe you don't understand

1024
01:43:59,510 --> 01:44:03,788
J' I don't understand it all myself

1025
01:44:03,948 --> 01:44:07,828
J' But there's a brother on my
left and another on my right

1026
01:44:07,985 --> 01:44:11,626
J' And in his pocket
just like mine

1027
01:44:11,789 --> 01:44:15,236
J' He's got a photograph

1028
01:44:15,393 --> 01:44:18,465
J' And they're waiting
for him back home

1029
01:44:18,629 --> 01:44:20,905
J' And it's weighing on my mind

1030
01:44:21,065 --> 01:44:24,012
J' I'm not trying to be a hero

1031
01:44:24,168 --> 01:44:26,808
J' I don't wanna die

1032
01:44:26,971 --> 01:44:29,474
J' But right now in this moment

1033
01:44:29,640 --> 01:44:32,086
J' You don't think twice

1034
01:44:33,578 --> 01:44:37,355
J' I wonder
Would I give my life?

1035
01:44:39,750 --> 01:44:43,061
J' Could I make that sacrifice?

1036
01:44:45,223 --> 01:44:47,999
J' If it came down to it
Couldl take the bullet?

1037
01:44:48,159 --> 01:44:53,268
J' I would
Yes, I would

1038
01:44:54,932 --> 01:44:57,674
J' You don't think about right

1039
01:44:57,802 --> 01:45:00,442
J' You don't think about wrong

1040
01:45:00,605 --> 01:45:03,245
J' You just do what you gotta do

1041
01:45:03,407 --> 01:45:06,047
J' To defend your own

1042
01:45:06,210 --> 01:45:09,748
J' And I'd do the same

1043
01:45:09,914 --> 01:45:13,521
J' For you
Yes, I would

1044
01:45:22,093 --> 01:45:24,198
J' Yes, I would

1045
01:45:38,376 --> 01:45:41,323
J' I would give my life

1046
01:45:43,281 --> 01:45:47,058
J' I would make that sacrifice

1047
01:45:50,054 --> 01:45:51,931
J' 'Cause if it came down to it

1048
01:45:52,089 --> 01:45:55,127
J' Couldl take a bullet?

01:46:06,771 --> 01:46:09,149
