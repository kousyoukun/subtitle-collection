1
00:00:24,988 --> 00:00:28,149
Coming through!

2
00:00:29,267 --> 00:00:31,595
Do you understand?
Keep your hands off me!

3
00:00:33,746 --> 00:00:36,239
- I'll be with you in a moment.
- Don't walk away.

4
00:00:36,465 --> 00:00:38,866
- What kind of doctor are you, anyway?
- Just a minute.

5
00:00:38,901 --> 00:00:41,096
Doctor, I can't feel my arm.
I can't feel it.

6
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,974
- I can't feel my arm.
- I can't feel it right now either.

7
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,935
- Can someone feel his arm?
- I can't feel it.

8
00:00:50,145 --> 00:00:51,563
Don't touch my hair.

9
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,607
Kiss the boo-boo.
Kiss the boo-boo.

10
00:00:53,774 --> 00:00:56,901
- Hey, you're still here.
- Yeah, I'm still here. Can you believe it?

11
00:00:57,068 --> 00:01:00,904
Save me some coffee,
you savage.

12
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,908
What is this,
Alfred Hitchcock Presents?

13
00:01:09,412 --> 00:01:12,289
- What's the problem?
- Gunshot wounds. Shoulder, abdomen.

14
00:01:12,455 --> 00:01:15,000
We've been paging you.
You on California time already?

15
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:17,876
- I was in Radiology working on my tan.
- Pulse, 120.

16
00:01:18,043 --> 00:01:20,129
Get this guy typed
and crossed, huh?

17
00:01:20,587 --> 00:01:24,549
Okay, question: Beverly Hills,
beautiful women and plastic surgery...

18
00:01:24,716 --> 00:01:27,635
what do these three
things have in common?

19
00:01:27,802 --> 00:01:29,136
Me, in less than a week.

20
00:01:29,928 --> 00:01:33,390
Okay, don't worry about his shoulder.
He's probably bleeding internally.

21
00:01:33,557 --> 00:01:36,726
Call Dr. Sotto, tell him to prep for O.R.
I'm out of here tonight.

22
00:01:36,892 --> 00:01:40,437
Convince me I'll be nostalgic for here
when I'm at the Halberstrom Clinic.

23
00:01:40,604 --> 00:01:42,731
- Halberstrom?
- Cosmetic surgery for the rich.

24
00:01:42,897 --> 00:01:46,525
- I'm not in it for the money.
- Half a million salary when he's partner.

25
00:01:46,692 --> 00:01:51,029
That high-profit stuff makes it possible
for us to do reconstructive surgery...

26
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:53,406
on the needier patients.
You're a saint.

27
00:01:53,573 --> 00:01:57,618
- Got another customer over there.
- I'll do it. My going-away present to you.

28
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:01,163
- What's the problem?
- Too much fun. Substance unknown.

29
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,832
Okay, stay with us. Stay with us.
What'd you take, man?

30
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:06,876
Bluebirds, dillies, love boats?

31
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:10,170
I heard Halberstrom might not
even hire anyone this year.

32
00:02:10,337 --> 00:02:11,588
Well, I'm not anyone.

33
00:02:12,172 --> 00:02:15,925
Mulready, some of the guys are having
a going-away bash for me tonight.

34
00:02:16,091 --> 00:02:19,052
- If you're interested, I'd love...
- Not in this lifetime.

35
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:25,057
- Clean up.
- Thanks.

36
00:02:25,223 --> 00:02:28,268
Come on, what do you say, guys?
Dinner. Think about it.

37
00:02:28,435 --> 00:02:31,646
Come on, it's my last night.
A couple of lousy beers?

38
00:02:31,812 --> 00:02:34,106
- Take care, man.
- Guys...

39
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,819
I'll send you a postcard.

40
00:02:40,695 --> 00:02:42,404
What?

41
00:02:42,988 --> 00:02:45,824
At the risk of sounding schmaltzy,
I just wanna tell you...

42
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:48,618
that you're a schmuck.
I hope I never see you again.

43
00:02:48,826 --> 00:02:52,079
Thanks, Tommy. I know how hard
it was for you to say that.

44
00:02:52,246 --> 00:02:56,708
You're a good doctor, Ben. I just thought
you were gonna practice real medicine.

45
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:01,295
Think I'm making a mistake
going to Halberstrom?

46
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:05,924
No.
Cosmetic surgery is clean...

47
00:03:06,091 --> 00:03:09,551
you make tons of money,
nobody dies.

48
00:03:09,969 --> 00:03:11,637
What's wrong with that, right?

49
00:03:11,804 --> 00:03:13,389
Right.

50
00:03:13,722 --> 00:03:15,473
Bye, Ben.

51
00:04:50,468 --> 00:04:53,179
Oh, come on.

52
00:05:17,657 --> 00:05:18,991
Look out.

53
00:05:41,552 --> 00:05:44,929
All right, okay.
Can I just ask you...

54
00:05:45,096 --> 00:05:46,931
where am I now?

55
00:06:53,777 --> 00:06:59,532
Oh, man. Oh, God. Oh, God.
I'm okay. I'm okay.

56
00:07:00,074 --> 00:07:04,203
Accident. Woman in the middle
of the road with a cow!

57
00:07:04,912 --> 00:07:07,080
All right.
I'm okay.

58
00:07:07,497 --> 00:07:11,125
Damn, my car.
Oh, man, the whole front end is shot!

59
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,295
Am I glad you're here.

60
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:20,341
Is that a '56 or
a '57 Speedster?

61
00:07:20,799 --> 00:07:22,801
Fifty-six.

62
00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:26,304
Hey, come on, get out.
Will you get out of the car!

63
00:07:26,471 --> 00:07:27,805
Get away from there.

64
00:07:27,972 --> 00:07:30,641
- Took three weeks to build that fence.
- I'm sorry.

65
00:07:30,807 --> 00:07:33,435
Does this have a Super 90
engine or a 1600?

66
00:07:33,602 --> 00:07:35,687
It wasn't really
anybody's fault.

67
00:07:35,854 --> 00:07:38,231
My insurance will probably
pay for the fence...

68
00:07:38,397 --> 00:07:40,149
and that should be fine.
Okay?

69
00:07:40,316 --> 00:07:42,651
- Won't be the same.
- This ain't a kit car, is it?

70
00:07:42,817 --> 00:07:44,819
No, it ain't.
It isn't.

71
00:07:45,403 --> 00:07:48,489
My name is Ben Stone.

72
00:07:48,697 --> 00:07:50,950
I'm a medical doctor.
I'm a surgeon.

73
00:07:51,116 --> 00:07:52,826
Awesome.
Who thrashed the fence?

74
00:07:52,992 --> 00:07:55,537
I'm Ben Stone.
Here's the address of my clinic in L.A.

75
00:07:55,703 --> 00:07:58,414
- Did he say he's been stoned?
- He says he's from L.A.

76
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,874
You can send a bill there
or we can use plastic.

77
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,335
I'm not really from L.A.
I'm just on my way to...

78
00:08:03,502 --> 00:08:07,964
- You're lucky I was passing through.
- What's in the trunk? Pot?

79
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:13,176
I'm a surgeon. Come on, will you
get away! Get away from the car!

80
00:08:13,343 --> 00:08:14,928
- Sorry.
- Not you, the dog.

81
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:16,762
The finest fence I'll ever put up.

82
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:19,765
I know a Willie Stone in Stanton.
Is that family of yours?

83
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:22,892
- I understand what you're trying to do.
- This the new Mazda?

84
00:08:23,059 --> 00:08:25,854
And I'm not putting up
with any small-town bullshit.

85
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,272
Where's the dang engine?

86
00:08:28,438 --> 00:08:32,650
Get away from this car! You don't
even know where the engine is.

87
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,027
Got you.

88
00:08:37,113 --> 00:08:39,823
Look, I'm sorry
about what happened...

89
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:43,868
but it was an accident, okay?
It was nobody's fault.

90
00:08:44,034 --> 00:08:47,371
Get me to a phone. I'll call a Porsche
mechanic in the next big city.

91
00:08:47,538 --> 00:08:51,666
I'll get my car fixed, be on my way,
and you can go back to doing...

92
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,293
whatever it is you do.

93
00:08:56,587 --> 00:08:59,381
All right, I admit it!
I flattened the damn fence!

94
00:08:59,548 --> 00:09:01,966
What are you gonna do,
lock me up?

95
00:09:06,678 --> 00:09:11,098
Court finds the defendant guilty
of crimes under code 453-19...

96
00:09:11,265 --> 00:09:14,476
reckless driving, and 466-2,
reckless endangerment.

97
00:09:14,643 --> 00:09:17,187
- This is insane.
- No, this is Grady.

98
00:09:17,353 --> 00:09:20,982
Your Honor, there were cows
in the middle of the road.

99
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:24,902
Now, I told you my insurance company
would pay for a new fence.

100
00:09:25,068 --> 00:09:27,196
I built that fence myself.

101
00:09:27,362 --> 00:09:30,907
Neither you nor your insurance can
pay me for a fence I built myself.

102
00:09:31,073 --> 00:09:33,533
Next best thing would be
a fence that you built.

103
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:37,787
- These hands are delicate instruments.
- I doubt you could build a good fence.

104
00:09:37,954 --> 00:09:40,164
Therefore, since you're
a licensed physician...

105
00:09:40,331 --> 00:09:43,042
and we are a town in acute
shortage of medical care...

106
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:46,294
You wouldn't.
Your sentence will be 16 hours...

107
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:47,962
of community service...

108
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:51,089
served as resident doctor
at Grady Memorial Hospital.

109
00:09:51,256 --> 00:09:54,218
I have to be in Los Angeles
by Tuesday, so I don't...

110
00:09:54,384 --> 00:09:56,385
Thirty-two hours.

111
00:09:56,552 --> 00:09:59,597
- This is extortion!
- You want 64 hours?

112
00:10:00,932 --> 00:10:02,182
No.

113
00:10:03,099 --> 00:10:04,601
Court is adjourned.

114
00:10:04,768 --> 00:10:06,394
All rise.

115
00:10:07,102 --> 00:10:09,605
- I am so fucked.
- Watch your language, doc.

116
00:10:09,772 --> 00:10:14,984
You're in the buckle of the Bible belt
here. Try saying "fudge" or something.

117
00:10:15,276 --> 00:10:17,778
- "Fiddlesticks" too strong?
- Depends.

118
00:10:17,945 --> 00:10:20,239
Don't you worry about
your automobile, doc.

119
00:10:20,405 --> 00:10:24,158
I always wanted an excuse to
buy me a set of metric tools.

120
00:10:24,325 --> 00:10:27,411
Sh... Sugar.

121
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:53,182
Hey.

122
00:10:55,226 --> 00:10:56,768
I'm Dr. Benjamin Stone.

123
00:10:56,935 --> 00:11:00,730
Nurse Packer. I'm assuming
Judge Evans told you.

124
00:11:02,648 --> 00:11:04,525
Fine.
Here's what I need.

125
00:11:04,692 --> 00:11:08,862
Comfortable bed, hot shower,
warm meal, locker to put my stuff in...

126
00:11:09,028 --> 00:11:11,781
Could you show me some kind
of identification, please?

127
00:11:19,996 --> 00:11:23,374
I'm wearing glasses there.
I wear contacts now.

128
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,334
My hair's a little shorter.

129
00:11:29,671 --> 00:11:33,382
That's a mustache.
It's a bad picture.

130
00:11:33,549 --> 00:11:37,135
If you could direct me to the physician
on call tonight, I'll speak to him.

131
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,638
"When to call me:

132
00:11:41,805 --> 00:11:45,893
If you've been stabbed, shot, poisoned,
separated from an appendage...

133
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:49,228
knocked or beaten unconscious,
run over by a tractor, mower...

134
00:11:49,395 --> 00:11:52,731
or generally about to bleed to death.
Otherwise, leave me alone. "

135
00:11:52,898 --> 00:11:57,360
Signed,
Dr. Aurelius Edsel Hogue, M.D.

136
00:11:59,945 --> 00:12:02,239
I'm in The Twilight Zone.

137
00:12:04,574 --> 00:12:08,077
Zwieback and vitamin C in the
upper cabinet if you're hungry.

138
00:12:08,244 --> 00:12:11,914
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
This is the best you can do?

139
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:13,832
No.

140
00:12:29,637 --> 00:12:33,348
Oh, good, you're awake. Welcome
to Grady. I'm Mayor Nicholson.

141
00:12:33,515 --> 00:12:35,934
The second I heard a big-city
doctor was in town...

142
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,019
I left that rehearsal,
hightailed it over here...

143
00:12:39,186 --> 00:12:41,480
see if I can make you
more comfortable.

144
00:12:41,647 --> 00:12:43,856
- We can do better than this.
- Better than this?

145
00:12:44,023 --> 00:12:46,025
Say, these your duffles?

146
00:12:46,692 --> 00:12:50,779
I'm not claiming that Grady's no Paris,
France, but we got two gas stations...

147
00:12:50,946 --> 00:12:53,697
got us a Winn-Dixie, got us cable TV.
Like tennis?

148
00:12:53,864 --> 00:12:57,618
We got a new tennis court at the high
school. You doctors play golf, though.

149
00:12:57,785 --> 00:13:00,411
- Learning how to surf, actually.
- Isn't this pretty?

150
00:13:00,578 --> 00:13:04,082
We had this fixed up for a doctor we
got through the want ads years ago.

151
00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:06,834
- No one's been in it for a while.
- Mayor Nicholson.

152
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,461
I'm on my way to California.
Don't be thinking I'm staying here.

153
00:13:10,628 --> 00:13:13,005
No, no, of course not.

154
00:13:13,172 --> 00:13:15,591
Well, maybe not.
Give old Grady a chance...

155
00:13:15,758 --> 00:13:18,301
she might sneak up on
you like a bee in a bottle.

156
00:13:22,972 --> 00:13:24,306
Surprise!

157
00:13:24,473 --> 00:13:26,934
- Welcoming committee.
- I hope you're hungry.

158
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:29,519
Evening, ladies.

159
00:13:29,686 --> 00:13:33,522
Ben Stone, this here is Miss Violet
and Miss Lillian and Miss Maddie.

160
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:37,025
Ladies,
this here is Ben Stone, M.D.

161
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:41,154
Fried chicken, boiled peanuts
and sweet potato pie.

162
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,866
Catfish, biscuits,
butter beans and watermelon.

163
00:13:46,032 --> 00:13:49,161
Hungry-Man dinner.
I'm a bad cook.

164
00:13:49,326 --> 00:13:53,497
Well, I guess I'll just say adieu and
come chauffeur you in the morning.

165
00:13:53,664 --> 00:13:55,665
No, wait, wait, wait.
Come on.

166
00:13:55,832 --> 00:13:57,375
You can't leave me here...

167
00:13:57,542 --> 00:14:00,295
in the middle of nowhere with them.
It's getting late.

168
00:14:00,462 --> 00:14:04,214
Don't worry. Only one of them horny.
I'm not telling you which one.

169
00:14:04,381 --> 00:14:06,466
Your face.

170
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,599
You want a cocktail?

171
00:14:16,391 --> 00:14:20,811
So anyway, the high-profile,
high-profit work...

172
00:14:20,978 --> 00:14:24,022
just makes it possible for me
to do the more important...

173
00:14:24,189 --> 00:14:27,901
reconstructive surgery
for needier patients.

174
00:14:28,817 --> 00:14:31,195
And get a big house
on the beach.

175
00:14:31,361 --> 00:14:35,948
It's hard to believe. A man as good-looking
as Dr. Stone should be married.

176
00:14:36,115 --> 00:14:38,242
Maybe he ain't found
his Adam's rib yet.

177
00:14:38,409 --> 00:14:42,412
Maybe he indulges in the love
that dare not speak its name.

178
00:14:42,579 --> 00:14:45,080
- Lillian.
- Will I go blind?

179
00:14:46,373 --> 00:14:49,627
- It's moonshine, right?
- Well, ouzo, actually.

180
00:14:49,794 --> 00:14:53,171
- We took a cruise to Greece.
- Not me. I wasn't invited.

181
00:14:53,338 --> 00:14:56,173
It was one of those
golden-agers tours.

182
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,342
Sunset Tours, honey.

183
00:14:58,509 --> 00:15:01,470
- They ate the brains out of a goat.
- Not me.

184
00:15:01,637 --> 00:15:03,971
- We ate dog.
- I didn't eat no dog.

185
00:15:04,138 --> 00:15:07,058
You don't know
that you didn't.

186
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:10,936
Dr. Stone, there's a legend
about friendship quilts.

187
00:15:11,102 --> 00:15:12,729
That's bunk.

188
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:17,608
Folks say that the first person
to sleep under a friendship quilt...

189
00:15:17,775 --> 00:15:20,485
will meet the one
they're gonna marry.

190
00:15:20,652 --> 00:15:23,780
Dream about the one they're
gonna marry, and it's bunk.

191
00:15:23,947 --> 00:15:27,157
What a fine hand he has.

192
00:15:28,033 --> 00:15:29,909
Dr. Stone?

193
00:15:30,952 --> 00:15:32,703
Dr. Stone?

194
00:16:46,431 --> 00:16:48,640
Oh, God.

195
00:17:11,284 --> 00:17:12,952
Hello.

196
00:17:14,788 --> 00:17:16,121
Hi.

197
00:17:16,955 --> 00:17:19,708
- Good morning.
- Is something wrong?

198
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:22,168
No, no, no.

199
00:17:23,044 --> 00:17:24,754
I'm a doctor.

200
00:17:24,921 --> 00:17:27,422
Yeah, I know who you are.

201
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:33,677
Hey, I'm sorry. Would you...?
Do you want this?

202
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:37,847
If you're a doctor, I don't have
anything you haven't seen before.

203
00:17:48,398 --> 00:17:50,650
You can blink now.

204
00:17:55,237 --> 00:17:58,740
All the boys from the state legislature
come here, do their recreating.

205
00:17:58,907 --> 00:18:02,368
Boy, can they litter. Presidents
come here during the fishing season.

206
00:18:02,535 --> 00:18:04,537
On purpose?

207
00:18:04,995 --> 00:18:08,164
One look at all this, Ben boy,
I'm sure you're saying to yourself:

208
00:18:08,331 --> 00:18:11,583
"I have come to Grady at the most
beautiful time of the year. "

209
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,920
But, boy, these dogwoods, azaleas,
when they blooming...

210
00:18:15,087 --> 00:18:18,923
they can't hold a candle to the nuclear
explosion of color come fall.

211
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:23,176
Nick, you're the mayor. You have the
authority to commute my sentence.

212
00:18:23,343 --> 00:18:24,928
Could you do that?

213
00:18:25,095 --> 00:18:28,139
I'll make it worth your while.
I get back to L.A., we could...

214
00:18:28,305 --> 00:18:31,058
Why on earth would
I wanna do that?

215
00:18:31,225 --> 00:18:34,727
How am I gonna convince you
to stay here if you're not here?

216
00:18:35,478 --> 00:18:39,189
We need a doctor,
you need patients.

217
00:18:39,398 --> 00:18:43,652
Get off the interstate, Ben Stone.

218
00:18:44,153 --> 00:18:45,737
Right?

219
00:18:48,781 --> 00:18:52,284
Don't let the signs of prosperity and
urban sprawl in downtown scare you.

220
00:18:52,451 --> 00:18:54,619
We're still the same
sleepy little paradise...

221
00:18:54,786 --> 00:18:58,164
that big-city shrinks recommend
for patients with nervous disorders.

222
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,750
It's the calming effect
of Grady's natural ozone.

223
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,626
Fact, there's a world-class
mental hospital up the road.

224
00:19:03,793 --> 00:19:05,128
That's a comforting thought.

225
00:19:05,295 --> 00:19:09,131
Ben Stone, do you like coffee?
If you like coffee, we won't go in here.

226
00:19:10,632 --> 00:19:12,550
- Is that him?
- That's him.

227
00:19:12,717 --> 00:19:16,012
- He's young, huh?
- Come on, let's go.

228
00:19:18,722 --> 00:19:21,183
Boys, this here is Ben Stone...

229
00:19:21,349 --> 00:19:24,477
a Hollywood physician who's
gonna spend a few days with us.

230
00:19:24,643 --> 00:19:28,898
Ben, this is Mortimer, John, Aubrey.
Probably don't want to shake his hand.

231
00:19:29,065 --> 00:19:32,067
Sorty in the corner.
Sorty got a cow that sings.

232
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:35,819
- You remember Cotton, Miss Lillian.
- Hollywood. La-la land.

233
00:19:36,153 --> 00:19:37,821
- Beverly Hills, actually.
- Whatever.

234
00:19:37,988 --> 00:19:41,866
- Well, William's been a movie star.
- It was just an Army training film.

235
00:19:42,033 --> 00:19:44,702
Come now, you were the star.
You played the lead role.

236
00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:49,039
It was about VD. I was the bacteria.
Had a big scene with penicillin.

237
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:51,832
Yes, a death scene.

238
00:19:51,999 --> 00:19:54,710
Take a load off, doctor.
This will stop your worries.

239
00:19:54,877 --> 00:19:56,796
Or start them.

240
00:19:58,254 --> 00:19:59,964
So, what do you
think of our town?

241
00:20:00,131 --> 00:20:02,716
- I haven't seen all of it yet.
- Yeah, you have.

242
00:20:03,884 --> 00:20:05,260
Opportunity abounds here.

243
00:20:05,427 --> 00:20:07,763
Growth rate was up
point three percent last year.

244
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:10,890
- There's no crime.
- By the way, we are the county seat.

245
00:20:11,057 --> 00:20:15,018
Fellas, no point in beating a dead horse
to death. That's all in the brochure.

246
00:20:15,185 --> 00:20:19,605
Ben Stone, we are prepared to
offer you a permanent position...

247
00:20:19,772 --> 00:20:23,275
as medical practitioner supreme
in the Grady metropolitan area...

248
00:20:23,442 --> 00:20:25,693
the squash capital of the South.

249
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,030
The salary's $27,000 per annum,
and plus housing.

250
00:20:30,031 --> 00:20:31,657
Twenty-seven thousand?

251
00:20:31,824 --> 00:20:35,452
- You see, Nick, I told you...
- Hold on. Thirty thousand.

252
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:39,122
Look, you people
don't even know me.

253
00:20:39,288 --> 00:20:41,957
I noticed right off that he
double-knots his shoelaces.

254
00:20:42,124 --> 00:20:44,751
- Excellent credentials.
- Shows he's careful.

255
00:20:45,168 --> 00:20:47,294
Anyway, don't you
already have a doctor?

256
00:20:47,461 --> 00:20:49,380
We got Hogue.
The problem with Hogue is...

257
00:20:49,547 --> 00:20:52,049
- He's old.
- Old and wholly unpleasant.

258
00:20:52,216 --> 00:20:54,384
Point is, he's not going
to be around forever.

259
00:20:54,592 --> 00:20:55,927
Thirty-five thousand?

260
00:20:56,094 --> 00:20:59,179
But that would take a unanimous
vote of the whole city council.

261
00:20:59,346 --> 00:21:01,390
- All in favor say, "Aye. "
- Aye.

262
00:21:01,557 --> 00:21:03,933
- I abstain.
- You always abstain.

263
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:08,104
Look,
I appreciate your problem...

264
00:21:08,271 --> 00:21:10,313
but I'm not the answer.

265
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,858
I got a big job interview
on the West Coast.

266
00:21:13,024 --> 00:21:16,694
It's very important I get there in the
next couple of days. Plastic surgery.

267
00:21:16,861 --> 00:21:21,072
The truth is, they can probably pay me
about 20 times what you can afford.

268
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:24,159
There's a lot of similarities
between Grady and Los Angeles.

269
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:25,952
They're just bigger, is all.

270
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,579
- What do I owe you?
- Ten bucks.

271
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:31,415
- Ten bucks for coffee and toast?
- Got you.

272
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:34,333
Tell you what, why don't you
wait to make up your mind...

273
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,419
till after the squash festival, huh?

274
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:41,006
All I'm saying, Ben Stone, is give
Grady a chance. I bet you'll like her.

275
00:21:42,591 --> 00:21:46,719
Yeah, well,
nice meeting you all.

276
00:21:46,886 --> 00:21:48,636
Thanks.

277
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:01,230
- Howdy, nurse. How you doing?
- Doctor's lounge is down the hall.

278
00:22:01,397 --> 00:22:06,401
You can change in there, then Lou will
show you around. This is your time card.

279
00:22:08,028 --> 00:22:10,614
You gotta be kidding.

280
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:21,830
- Local call?
- I don't know anybody local.

281
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:24,833
Pay phone's in the waiting room.

282
00:22:27,252 --> 00:22:32,799
Yeah, it's... No, it's a collect
call from Dr. Benjamin Stone.

283
00:22:32,964 --> 00:22:34,674
Stone.

284
00:22:34,841 --> 00:22:36,551
Come on, do you mind?
This is a...

285
00:22:37,719 --> 00:22:41,138
personal call.
I guess so.

286
00:22:43,516 --> 00:22:48,228
Yeah, hi. Yes, this is Dr. Stone.
Actually, that's why I'm calling.

287
00:22:48,395 --> 00:22:51,063
I don't think I'm gonna be
able to make it on Tuesday.

288
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:53,857
I just...
There was a...

289
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,777
A medical emergency in...

290
00:22:57,944 --> 00:23:00,946
They don't have a doctor,
so I volunteered my services.

291
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:04,366
I'll need to stay until
the situation stabilizes.

292
00:23:04,533 --> 00:23:06,201
Yeah, medically speaking.

293
00:23:07,118 --> 00:23:09,578
You're interviewing other doctors?
Friday?

294
00:23:09,745 --> 00:23:14,416
Yeah, okay, Friday. I can do that. No,
thank you very much. And thank Doctor...

295
00:23:15,917 --> 00:23:19,753
That was better tap-dancing
than I've seen on Star Search.

296
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,508
If you tell me you're here for a physical,
you're gonna make my day.

297
00:23:25,675 --> 00:23:28,428
It's unprofessional to
flirt with the patients.

298
00:23:28,594 --> 00:23:32,764
I'm just on my way to Beverly Hills.
Plastic surgery.

299
00:23:32,931 --> 00:23:34,765
Not that you need any.

300
00:23:34,932 --> 00:23:36,809
Nice try.

301
00:23:36,976 --> 00:23:40,687
So is this the GQ look
for young urban doctors?

302
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:45,233
Well, I've spent the last two years
doing 18-hour days in the ER.

303
00:23:45,399 --> 00:23:48,819
I find these are
pretty comfortable.

304
00:23:49,236 --> 00:23:51,154
You don't like them?

305
00:23:51,404 --> 00:23:53,031
No.

306
00:23:54,991 --> 00:23:58,577
Okay, fine. Well, I really enjoyed
our time together here...

307
00:23:58,744 --> 00:24:02,788
but since you're obviously not a patient,
and I'm not getting anywhere...

308
00:24:02,955 --> 00:24:06,709
tell me where I can find a guy
named Lou, drives an ambulance?

309
00:24:06,876 --> 00:24:08,626
I'm Lou.

310
00:24:18,093 --> 00:24:19,969
Where did all these
people come from?

311
00:24:20,136 --> 00:24:23,389
Folks hear there's a doctor on duty,
they come running.

312
00:24:23,556 --> 00:24:26,058
Any old doctor.

313
00:24:28,852 --> 00:24:30,770
Send them in.

314
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:34,607
Okay, Mr. Tidwell.

315
00:24:34,774 --> 00:24:37,317
What the hell have
you got on your foot?

316
00:24:37,484 --> 00:24:39,069
That's a poultice.

317
00:24:39,235 --> 00:24:43,155
- Nurse Packer!
- I got a hold to Doc Hogue on the CB...

318
00:24:43,322 --> 00:24:45,908
and he said that that
will hold me till I came in.

319
00:24:46,075 --> 00:24:47,533
- You did this on purpose?
- Yes.

320
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,912
It's chimney soot, biscuit flour
and lard. Doc Hogue said...

321
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:56,416
Wipe that crap off Mr. Tidwell's foot,
please, and clean that wound out.

322
00:24:58,417 --> 00:25:02,004
- You allergic to penicillin?
- Don't know. Ask Doc Hogue.

323
00:25:02,171 --> 00:25:05,340
Doubt Doc Hogue knows
it's even been discovered.

324
00:25:05,965 --> 00:25:10,135
Okay. Nurse Packer,
I'm gonna wash this with Betadine...

325
00:25:10,302 --> 00:25:14,514
close it with a butterfly,
give it a sterile dressing.

326
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:17,517
You sure you ought to be
doing that so darned fast?

327
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:19,811
I hope so, Mr. Tidwell...

328
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:22,020
because je suis fini.

329
00:25:26,941 --> 00:25:30,236
Okay, Mrs. Owens, if you could
please get up on the table...

330
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:31,986
put your feet in the stirrups.

331
00:25:39,576 --> 00:25:41,620
We're just here about our mail.

332
00:25:42,121 --> 00:25:45,915
It's from my sister.
We don't read.

333
00:25:48,667 --> 00:25:52,838
- This ever happen before, Mr. McClary?
- Hell, yes. It happens.

334
00:25:53,005 --> 00:25:55,423
This ain't nearly the biggest
one I ever took.

335
00:25:55,589 --> 00:25:59,718
I had a hook in my thigh once.
It must have been, I'd say, like...

336
00:25:59,884 --> 00:26:02,137
Oh, excuse me, I...
Yeah, well...

337
00:26:02,303 --> 00:26:05,806
- Fishing's a dangerous business.
- Well, it can be.

338
00:26:05,973 --> 00:26:08,013
"And after the cow died,

339
00:26:08,026 --> 00:26:12,196
there just wasn't any
reason for him to go on.

340
00:26:12,729 --> 00:26:16,606
Meanwhile, Ellen's got herself mixed
up with a Pakistani gentleman...

341
00:26:16,773 --> 00:26:20,193
who nobody can understand
what he is saying.

342
00:26:20,777 --> 00:26:22,820
Not even Ellen. "

343
00:26:23,112 --> 00:26:25,656
I don't see any toxic striations.

344
00:26:25,823 --> 00:26:27,324
Red streaks.

345
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:30,118
You sure it was a black widow?

346
00:26:30,285 --> 00:26:34,621
Here.
I kept it in some T.P.

347
00:26:36,248 --> 00:26:38,541
Oh, dear Lord, it's escaped.

348
00:26:40,793 --> 00:26:42,754
- There it is.
- Wait, there he goes.

349
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,797
- Here he goes. Here he goes.
- Step on it.

350
00:26:45,964 --> 00:26:48,842
"She thinks Ray's having an
affair with the pastor's wife...

351
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:52,386
but Ray swears it's
his scrub-up rash. "

352
00:26:53,054 --> 00:26:56,181
Ray is a nut, I'm telling you.

353
00:26:56,431 --> 00:26:59,893
It's like a blurred
spot in my vision.

354
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:05,105
Out there. No. There. No.
No, there.

355
00:27:16,657 --> 00:27:18,783
I'm cured.

356
00:27:19,241 --> 00:27:23,495
"The pastor's wife got busted
for growing marijuana...

357
00:27:23,662 --> 00:27:25,580
out behind the rectory.

358
00:27:25,747 --> 00:27:31,126
So she'll be spending a spell up in Tupelo
at the minimum-security prison. "

359
00:27:33,836 --> 00:27:35,963
That's it?

360
00:27:37,215 --> 00:27:39,967
What about Ellen
and the Pakistani?

361
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:52,268
Nurse Packer?
Nurse Packer.

362
00:27:52,435 --> 00:27:56,355
Where's Doc Hogue? The boy can't
breathe right, and he's turning blue.

363
00:27:56,522 --> 00:27:57,856
I'm the doctor here.

364
00:27:58,607 --> 00:28:00,985
Nurse Packer,
you've got to call Doc Hogue.

365
00:28:01,567 --> 00:28:04,862
- Please.
- It's all right. I'm the doctor.

366
00:28:05,989 --> 00:28:08,365
- How long has he been like this?
- All afternoon.

367
00:28:08,532 --> 00:28:10,117
- What's his name?
- Zeb.

368
00:28:10,283 --> 00:28:13,035
Hey, Zeb, this is going to be
a little cold, all right?

369
00:28:13,202 --> 00:28:15,496
I just wanna hear your heart.

370
00:28:16,664 --> 00:28:18,623
Does your tummy hurt?

371
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:23,003
All right, take him down to the
examination room. I'll be right there.

372
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:25,921
You know where that is?
Right there, okay?

373
00:28:26,088 --> 00:28:28,757
Have Zeb get up
on the table for me.

374
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,636
- Call Hogue. Get him here.
- He doesn't like to be disturbed.

375
00:28:33,803 --> 00:28:36,847
I really don't care. Forget Hogue.
What's the referral hospital?

376
00:28:37,014 --> 00:28:39,016
- Athens General.
- Call Athens General.

377
00:28:39,182 --> 00:28:42,476
We have a cardiac emergency.
Tell Lou to fire up the ambulance.

378
00:28:42,643 --> 00:28:45,563
No, forget it. They have a helicopter.
Tell them to send it.

379
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:49,607
- Get me Zeb's medical history.
- I better call Dr. Hogue.

380
00:28:49,774 --> 00:28:53,402
Damn it. Listen to me,
Hogue is not here. I'm here.

381
00:28:53,569 --> 00:28:55,446
You do it.

382
00:29:02,535 --> 00:29:04,202
Here's the situation.

383
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:07,664
Your son is turning blue because
he has an abnormal mitral valve.

384
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:11,250
It's causing a back flow of blood in
his heart. We may have to operate.

385
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:13,044
We'll send him to Athens General.

386
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,920
Dr. Hogue said you should
give the boy a Coke.

387
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:20,799
He says he's probably got a bellyache
and that you should give him a Coke.

388
00:29:23,844 --> 00:29:26,596
Listen, doctor, I've got a
boy here in cardiac crisis.

389
00:29:26,763 --> 00:29:30,807
You can't treat that with Coca-Cola or
Bisquick. We have to use real medicine.

390
00:29:30,974 --> 00:29:33,810
I'm sending him to Athens General.
You're his doctor...

391
00:29:33,977 --> 00:29:36,979
so get your fat ass out
of bed and go with him!

392
00:29:38,981 --> 00:29:42,943
- How long will the chopper be?
- Should be here any minute.

393
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,789
- Where's Stone?
- Dr. Hogue.

394
00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:03,210
What the hell kind of snot-nosed
puppy doctor are you anyway?

395
00:30:03,377 --> 00:30:06,629
Wake me up, scare these
folks out of their skivvies.

396
00:30:06,796 --> 00:30:09,048
Mitral valve regurge.

397
00:30:09,215 --> 00:30:13,385
I've had a lot of experience with it in ER.
I've even assisted in surgery to correct.

398
00:30:13,551 --> 00:30:17,471
God only knows how long he's had this,
but you overlooked it. Check his color.

399
00:30:17,638 --> 00:30:19,807
Nurse Packer,
get that crap off the boy.

400
00:30:20,224 --> 00:30:23,268
Gene, you gave him the
bismuth subnitrate, didn't you?

401
00:30:23,434 --> 00:30:26,271
- At first we thought...
- You gave him too much as usual.

402
00:30:27,312 --> 00:30:29,606
Turned him three shades of blue.

403
00:30:29,773 --> 00:30:33,067
- Bismuth subnitrate?
- Homegrown antacid.

404
00:30:33,234 --> 00:30:35,569
You hear a heart murmur?

405
00:30:35,736 --> 00:30:37,405
No, it's hard to detect.

406
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:40,573
You been sampling
your daddy's chaw?

407
00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:49,414
That will be 65 cents.

408
00:30:53,584 --> 00:30:56,295
Well, nice work, Hollywood.

409
00:30:56,461 --> 00:30:59,214
You were about to open
the chest of a 6-year-old boy...

410
00:30:59,381 --> 00:31:03,467
to cure a case of diarrhea.
Now, listen up, smart-ass.

411
00:31:03,634 --> 00:31:06,177
Next time I tell you how to
treat a patient of mine...

412
00:31:06,344 --> 00:31:09,222
you better damn
well do it, "doctor".

413
00:31:09,389 --> 00:31:12,683
I doubt you'd know
crap from Crisco.

414
00:31:23,108 --> 00:31:24,735
Hey.

415
00:31:26,945 --> 00:31:29,822
Yeah, right.

416
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:36,870
Shit!

417
00:31:39,955 --> 00:31:42,750
Wait. Wait.
Hold your horses, doc.

418
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:46,669
Now, what if I walked in in the
middle of a hernia operation...

419
00:31:46,836 --> 00:31:49,922
see some poor gentleman's
guts all over?

420
00:31:50,213 --> 00:31:52,591
- You killed my car.
- I resent that.

421
00:31:52,758 --> 00:31:55,801
That car was my life, Melvin.
That car was my baby.

422
00:31:55,968 --> 00:31:58,888
You want me to stop now?
I can put it in some boxes...

423
00:31:59,055 --> 00:32:02,265
ship it out to Hollywood for you.
No skin off my nose.

424
00:32:02,432 --> 00:32:04,392
You and me called it
an oil pump casing.

425
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,478
Lane had two years of the German
language in high school.

426
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:13,107
Doc,
let's step into my office.

427
00:32:15,985 --> 00:32:18,904
I don't need a car.
I'm moving to Los Angeles.

428
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:22,032
- What do I need a car for?
- Lash yourself to the mast.

429
00:32:22,199 --> 00:32:25,660
Fella up in Oregon has an oil pump
he could air-express to us tomorrow.

430
00:32:25,826 --> 00:32:29,955
Two hundred thirty-nine bucks,
plus shipping. Only one problem.

431
00:32:30,163 --> 00:32:32,540
Oregon exploded.

432
00:32:32,707 --> 00:32:34,209
No.

433
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:38,087
He don't take credit.
Or checks.

434
00:32:38,254 --> 00:32:42,298
And tomorrow being Saturday,
you can't just wire some cash to him.

435
00:32:42,465 --> 00:32:45,385
Okay, Melvin,
let me ask you this.

436
00:32:45,551 --> 00:32:49,054
How do you propose
I pay for this?

437
00:32:49,221 --> 00:32:50,764
Well, I was hoping you'd pay me.

438
00:32:50,931 --> 00:32:55,142
Then I can trade him for a front rocker
assembly I got from a '68 Nova, but...

439
00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:59,145
- You don't take credit or checks.
- No, sir. I apologize.

440
00:32:59,312 --> 00:33:01,147
How long will this
guy in Oregon wait?

441
00:33:01,314 --> 00:33:04,275
I imagine I could stall
him till Sunday noon.

442
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:09,028
Now, he got another taker in Arizona,
but I was first.

443
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,366
Stall him.

444
00:33:17,744 --> 00:33:19,495
- Hi, doc.
- Hi, doc.

445
00:33:19,662 --> 00:33:23,207
- Morning, doc.
- Morning, Ben Stone.

446
00:33:23,374 --> 00:33:25,375
Howdy, y'all.

447
00:33:30,963 --> 00:33:34,675
- Dr. Stone. Dr. Stone, I presume.
- Yeah, that's right.

448
00:33:34,842 --> 00:33:36,301
- Hi.
- Hi.

449
00:33:36,467 --> 00:33:38,803
Say, you're much taller
than they said you were.

450
00:33:39,846 --> 00:33:42,514
I'm sitting on a stool.

451
00:33:43,724 --> 00:33:45,142
And you are?

452
00:33:45,309 --> 00:33:48,477
Dying to get out of this town.
How about you?

453
00:33:48,644 --> 00:33:50,855
- Here's your breakfast.
- I haven't ordered yet.

454
00:33:51,022 --> 00:33:54,232
Compliments of the house.
Don't let old Hogue scare you off.

455
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,819
We know you weren't aiming
to kill that boy last night.

456
00:33:58,527 --> 00:34:01,238
Wait a minute, you're not
planning on staying in Grady?

457
00:34:01,405 --> 00:34:04,157
- Only as long as I have to.
- Thank God.

458
00:34:04,324 --> 00:34:07,076
For a second, I thought they
got their hooks into you too.

459
00:34:07,243 --> 00:34:10,746
- Wait, you don't like Grady?
- No.

460
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:12,664
So how come you don't leave?

461
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,916
With you?

462
00:34:16,542 --> 00:34:18,502
Is that a proposition, doctor?

463
00:34:19,837 --> 00:34:22,339
I better eat this before it's cold.
Nice meeting you.

464
00:34:22,505 --> 00:34:24,466
Thanks, Lillian.

465
00:34:30,888 --> 00:34:35,350
"Prosser on Torts. " "Civil Procedure. "
A little light reading this morning?

466
00:34:35,516 --> 00:34:37,017
Did I invite you to sit down?

467
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:40,354
No, but you were going to.
Southern hospitality and all.

468
00:34:41,355 --> 00:34:43,856
- Now what?
- Now let's talk about you.

469
00:34:44,023 --> 00:34:46,943
Okay. I like my privacy.
I'm a vegetarian.

470
00:34:47,109 --> 00:34:50,612
I'd appreciate it if you'd take that
slab of ham to the counter with you.

471
00:34:50,779 --> 00:34:53,989
- It gives me the willies.
- I didn't order this slab.

472
00:34:54,156 --> 00:34:58,244
Now I suppose you'll say something
cute to stall your retreat.

473
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:00,119
Maybe tell me
about the big city...

474
00:35:00,286 --> 00:35:03,039
all the things I'm missing
living in this dinky town...

475
00:35:03,206 --> 00:35:06,416
and how you'd like to be the
one to take me out of it.

476
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:11,337
Isn't that why you're
going to law school?

477
00:35:11,504 --> 00:35:13,881
You want to get out
of this dinky little town.

478
00:35:14,257 --> 00:35:18,593
I'm not going yet. And I plan to
practice in Grady when I'm through.

479
00:35:19,469 --> 00:35:22,137
Yeah, it looks like a
hotbed of legal activity.

480
00:35:22,304 --> 00:35:26,141
Well, malpractice for visiting
young surgeons seems promising.

481
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:28,226
Who's the green apple, Vialula?

482
00:35:28,977 --> 00:35:31,437
- Henry, this is Ben Stone.
- Hey.

483
00:35:31,604 --> 00:35:34,022
Oh, yeah, the new croaker.

484
00:35:34,189 --> 00:35:35,691
Hank Gordon.

485
00:35:35,857 --> 00:35:37,192
You're in my chair.

486
00:35:38,985 --> 00:35:41,028
- Boyfriend?
- "Friend" friend.

487
00:35:51,328 --> 00:35:54,039
- Need any life insurance?
- What?

488
00:35:54,206 --> 00:35:57,458
You should be vested
in a term life program.

489
00:35:57,625 --> 00:36:00,003
Probably a quarter
of a mil to start.

490
00:36:00,295 --> 00:36:02,880
Come by my office.
We could run a "what if. "

491
00:36:03,171 --> 00:36:05,048
Or are you too chicken?

492
00:36:08,259 --> 00:36:11,220
I read somewhere doctors
have the highest suicide rate...

493
00:36:11,387 --> 00:36:13,388
in any profession
except dentistry.

494
00:36:13,555 --> 00:36:17,266
- Is that true?
- I won't underwrite dentists. Nope.

495
00:36:17,433 --> 00:36:20,561
Never trust a man who'll
put his hand in your mouth.

496
00:36:20,895 --> 00:36:24,188
Well, I'd love to stay and hear
where this conversation's headed...

497
00:36:24,355 --> 00:36:26,649
but if you all will excuse me.

498
00:36:27,817 --> 00:36:31,028
There's something else
I wanted to ask you.

499
00:36:31,612 --> 00:36:36,365
Do doctors know more about
sex than normal people?

500
00:36:39,285 --> 00:36:41,953
I need some ketchup.

501
00:36:42,579 --> 00:36:45,122
I have a fair knowledge
of animal husbandry.

502
00:36:45,289 --> 00:36:47,541
It's all pretty much
the same thing.

503
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:49,293
- Bye, doc.
- Bye.

504
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:52,045
Women trouble, Ben Stone?

505
00:36:52,712 --> 00:36:54,589
Squat here.

506
00:36:57,466 --> 00:37:00,677
- Regard the Grady squash.
- Looks like a yellow zucchini.

507
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:05,723
Nope. See, up until 1933, you had
your Grady, you had your zucchini.

508
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,724
They're going at it,
gourd to gourd.

509
00:37:07,891 --> 00:37:11,436
Freak tornado accident wiped out
a whole shipment of Gradys...

510
00:37:11,603 --> 00:37:16,732
bound for, I believe, agricultural
stardom at the Chicago World's Fair.

511
00:37:16,899 --> 00:37:19,108
The zucchini took there.
Never relented.

512
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:23,404
If it had gone the other way, no telling
where this town would be today.

513
00:37:24,196 --> 00:37:25,906
What are you talking about?

514
00:37:26,615 --> 00:37:29,535
Timing.
Same thing with women.

515
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,745
And with Southern women,
they require substantial commitment.

516
00:37:32,912 --> 00:37:35,580
You might have to stay here
for six months, maybe more.

517
00:37:35,747 --> 00:37:39,459
- Are you a betting man, Nick?
- I have been known on occasion.

518
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,545
- Take me about a week.
- Now, wait a minute.

519
00:37:42,711 --> 00:37:47,298
- You mean Vialula in the center pocket?
- Ten bucks.

520
00:37:49,551 --> 00:37:51,928
Okay, you got it.

521
00:37:53,095 --> 00:37:55,556
Feels like I'm fleecing you,
Ben Stone.

522
00:37:58,432 --> 00:38:00,268
Easy.

523
00:38:03,186 --> 00:38:05,438
Hello, Nurse Packer.

524
00:38:08,191 --> 00:38:09,775
All right.

525
00:38:09,942 --> 00:38:12,570
Okay, let's get something
straight right now.

526
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:17,532
I got eight years of higher education, one
year of internship, one year of residency.

527
00:38:17,699 --> 00:38:19,200
I'm $ 70,000 in debt.

528
00:38:19,367 --> 00:38:21,869
Now I'm waylaid in
this heehaw hell...

529
00:38:22,035 --> 00:38:25,580
and you insist on clocking me in
and out like I'm a factory worker.

530
00:38:25,746 --> 00:38:29,584
Well, no! N-O, no!
This is where I draw the line.

531
00:38:30,835 --> 00:38:33,920
I believe you have a visitor, doctor.

532
00:38:37,339 --> 00:38:42,011
Doc, my foot feels so good,
I brought you this pig.

533
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:47,182
Okay.

534
00:38:47,348 --> 00:38:50,350
I can't abide being
in no man's debt.

535
00:38:50,517 --> 00:38:52,895
This pig's all I got to give.

536
00:38:54,854 --> 00:38:57,732
I'm already paid, more or less,
by the hospital.

537
00:38:57,899 --> 00:39:01,776
- I really can't accept your pig.
- It's a done deal.

538
00:39:02,819 --> 00:39:05,029
She's your pig now.

539
00:39:06,197 --> 00:39:08,407
God bless you both.

540
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:17,289
Keep your animal outside.
This is a hospital.

541
00:39:31,092 --> 00:39:33,427
- Nice pig there, doc.
- Thank you.

542
00:39:33,594 --> 00:39:36,430
- Lovely pig.
- Thank you very much. Appreciate it.

543
00:39:36,597 --> 00:39:39,974
- Nice pig, doc!
- Thank you.

544
00:39:40,141 --> 00:39:43,102
Thank you all very much.

545
00:39:49,357 --> 00:39:55,028
Ben Stone. Say, I think I just took away
your last reason to go to California.

546
00:39:55,195 --> 00:39:58,073
Norrisville Drum and Bugle Corps.

547
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,449
They played last four
years in the Rose Parade.

548
00:40:00,616 --> 00:40:04,119
I got them under exclusive contract
to the Grady Squash Festival.

549
00:40:04,286 --> 00:40:05,745
I'm not staying.

550
00:40:06,162 --> 00:40:07,622
Sure, you aren't.

551
00:40:07,789 --> 00:40:10,917
Oh, by the way, dinner at my
house tomorrow night, 6:00.

552
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:12,668
- Dinner?
- Didn't I tell you?

553
00:40:12,835 --> 00:40:14,169
You're guest of honor.

554
00:40:15,128 --> 00:40:18,673
Shoot a monkey. If my head wasn't
attached, I'd need wood screws.

555
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,424
- Nice pig, doc.
- Thanks.

556
00:40:20,591 --> 00:40:22,801
Can I bring a date?

557
00:40:22,968 --> 00:40:25,637
Well, I don't know.
Can you?

558
00:40:27,848 --> 00:40:31,725
This is Ben Stone you're talking to.
Come on, pig.

559
00:40:33,227 --> 00:40:35,520
Fine pig, doc.

560
00:40:40,399 --> 00:40:41,567
Melvin.

561
00:40:42,192 --> 00:40:45,486
Melvin.
Melvin.

562
00:40:45,695 --> 00:40:49,240
Hey, doc. We're just
rehearsing for the pageant.

563
00:40:49,407 --> 00:40:52,784
We doing a pollination rap song.

564
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:57,246
Melvin, listen.

565
00:40:57,413 --> 00:41:01,875
I don't have the money for the
oil-gepumpkin-hausen thing.

566
00:41:04,085 --> 00:41:08,088
I mean, when I say I haven't got
the money, that's not entirely true.

567
00:41:08,255 --> 00:41:10,174
I have the money.
I'm good for the money.

568
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:13,384
It's just a matter of accessing
the money in a period of time.

569
00:41:13,551 --> 00:41:16,304
Can we work something out, please?

570
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:19,514
This car has got to be
ready by the time I leave.

571
00:41:22,893 --> 00:41:26,061
- That your pig?
- Yeah.

572
00:41:34,027 --> 00:41:38,113
You want to trade?
Pig for the part?

573
00:41:38,906 --> 00:41:41,073
If you can part with the pig.

574
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,203
Good.

575
00:41:50,582 --> 00:41:53,083
- Hi.
- Hi.

576
00:41:58,254 --> 00:42:01,508
- You just pick those?
- Yes, ma'am.

577
00:42:02,383 --> 00:42:05,803
They're protected by law.
State flowers.

578
00:42:08,387 --> 00:42:10,097
Figures.

579
00:42:10,556 --> 00:42:14,851
I'm already serving time for the fence.
May as well take my chances, right?

580
00:42:15,018 --> 00:42:19,396
Mama. Mama, who is it?
Who are you?

581
00:42:22,858 --> 00:42:24,652
I'm Ben.

582
00:42:25,944 --> 00:42:28,446
Emma, take these inside
and put them in some water.

583
00:42:28,655 --> 00:42:31,114
You're not supposed
to pick these.

584
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:33,367
Use the plastic pitcher.

585
00:42:36,077 --> 00:42:38,037
Yeah, she's mine.

586
00:42:38,246 --> 00:42:40,998
She's 4.
You wanna retreat now or...?

587
00:42:41,207 --> 00:42:42,833
No, no, no.

588
00:42:42,999 --> 00:42:45,752
No.
Actually, I just came by...

589
00:42:45,961 --> 00:42:49,463
because I need a date for
dinner tomorrow night.

590
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:52,633
- Nick Nicholson's?
- Yeah. How'd you know?

591
00:42:52,966 --> 00:42:56,386
Can't poop in this town without
everyone knowing what color it is.

592
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:06,769
I was fixing to have a cocktail.

593
00:43:06,978 --> 00:43:08,771
Are you in a hurry?

594
00:43:11,398 --> 00:43:13,441
Oh, man, that's tart.

595
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:17,778
It's called a " Slow Comfortable Screw
Up Against a Wall," with a twist.

596
00:43:17,945 --> 00:43:20,947
- Is that a Grady specialty?
- No.

597
00:43:21,156 --> 00:43:23,575
- New York City.
- New York?

598
00:43:23,783 --> 00:43:27,035
Yeah. I worked at one of those
weirdo theme bars on the West Side.

599
00:43:27,244 --> 00:43:29,913
Wayne and I went to
college in New York.

600
00:43:30,664 --> 00:43:32,457
Then he dropped out.

601
00:43:32,623 --> 00:43:36,586
I got pregnant.
He couldn't get work, so I bartended.

602
00:43:36,794 --> 00:43:39,254
I managed to finish school, though.

603
00:43:39,421 --> 00:43:41,965
- Wayne isn't still...?
- Wayne...

604
00:43:42,174 --> 00:43:45,259
is a professional dancer.

605
00:43:45,468 --> 00:43:47,511
One of those exotic
Chippendale things.

606
00:43:47,678 --> 00:43:51,097
He's in Boston, Miami...
I can't keep track.

607
00:43:51,556 --> 00:43:53,850
He left me after
Emma was born.

608
00:43:54,057 --> 00:43:57,060
I divorced him and came
running back here.

609
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:02,690
Wayne has this extremely
high opinion of his legs.

610
00:44:02,899 --> 00:44:05,567
You know, I just can't picture
you in the big city.

611
00:44:05,775 --> 00:44:07,569
New York.

612
00:44:07,944 --> 00:44:09,488
It's like me...

613
00:44:09,654 --> 00:44:12,031
- In Grady?
- Yeah.

614
00:44:13,115 --> 00:44:15,701
Well, peel an onion,
there's lots of layers.

615
00:44:17,786 --> 00:44:19,329
What layer is Hank on?

616
00:44:20,622 --> 00:44:23,624
Henry Gordon's sweet on me.

617
00:44:24,166 --> 00:44:26,043
And he's pretty
decent and solid...

618
00:44:26,251 --> 00:44:29,754
once you get past the " Insurance
Rebel Without a Clause" routine.

619
00:44:30,421 --> 00:44:32,632
Decent and solid.

620
00:44:33,173 --> 00:44:34,466
Very romantic.

621
00:44:37,427 --> 00:44:42,431
I can see you coming from
half a mile away, Dr. Stone.

622
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,849
You and your slick city ways.

623
00:44:45,058 --> 00:44:46,851
I suspect your
version of romance...

624
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:50,020
is whatever will separate
me from my panties.

625
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:55,234
Look, all I'm talking
about is dinner.

626
00:44:55,399 --> 00:44:58,152
In public.
Wear a dress.

627
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,530
Panties are optional.

628
00:45:01,988 --> 00:45:06,034
Well, I never have had
dinner at the mayor's house.

629
00:45:06,201 --> 00:45:08,327
Oh, boy.

630
00:45:08,953 --> 00:45:12,205
And after all,
how could I possibly refuse the man...

631
00:45:12,413 --> 00:45:14,624
who saved Jasmine
from the butcher?

632
00:45:16,126 --> 00:45:19,545
- What are you talking about?
- Tidwell's pig.

633
00:45:19,753 --> 00:45:21,964
He was about to sell
her for pork chops...

634
00:45:22,131 --> 00:45:25,133
if you hadn't fixed his foot,
made him feel guilty.

635
00:45:25,299 --> 00:45:28,802
Emma loves pigs.
You keeping her over at your house?

636
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:37,476
Lane, where's Melvin?

637
00:45:37,852 --> 00:45:41,271
Where's Melvin?
I want my pig back.

638
00:45:43,606 --> 00:45:46,442
Did you say he went to church?
At this hour?

639
00:45:48,986 --> 00:45:53,448
Are you allowed to come out here?
I can't understand what you're saying.

640
00:45:53,656 --> 00:45:57,159
Melvin's gone to church.
He's gone to Tylerville.

641
00:45:57,325 --> 00:45:59,786
The pig got took
to the butcher.

642
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:02,872
Melvin took my pig
to the butcher.

643
00:46:03,706 --> 00:46:05,332
What?

644
00:46:13,547 --> 00:46:15,966
Mr. Crawford, where's my pig?

645
00:46:16,175 --> 00:46:18,843
You know, Jasmine, my pig.
Is she still alive?

646
00:46:19,051 --> 00:46:21,596
- Yes. She's in back.
- Thank God. Thank God.

647
00:46:21,804 --> 00:46:24,098
- I want her back.
- Doc...

648
00:46:24,307 --> 00:46:26,892
I know what you're going to say.
Do you take plastic?

649
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:29,770
Not unless it's wrapped
around a stack of cash.

650
00:46:29,977 --> 00:46:31,771
Maybe we can work
it out in trade.

651
00:46:31,937 --> 00:46:35,274
I don't know. I ain't been
sick in three years, doc.

652
00:46:36,065 --> 00:46:38,318
I got an idea.

653
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:50,828
Where'd you learn to carve like that?
You're pretty darn good with a knife.

654
00:46:56,083 --> 00:46:58,125
- Hey, Maddie. Hey, Emma.
- Hi, doc.

655
00:46:58,292 --> 00:47:00,961
You guys are pig-sitting
for me tonight?

656
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:02,630
Hey, Jasmine.

657
00:47:02,838 --> 00:47:04,464
- Who are you?
- Don't tease me.

658
00:47:04,631 --> 00:47:06,758
I'm serious.
You look like Lou, but prettier.

659
00:47:06,925 --> 00:47:10,511
I'm warning you, Stone, I could
probably whoop you in a fistfight.

660
00:47:10,677 --> 00:47:13,847
- Be a good girl.
- Bye.

661
00:47:14,014 --> 00:47:15,723
- Be a good girl.
- We'll be late.

662
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:19,811
Not too much TV for her.
She's a real pig about that.

663
00:47:23,897 --> 00:47:29,026
Hi. Come on in. Welcome.
You look fantastic.

664
00:47:29,235 --> 00:47:30,945
- And you look handsome too.
- Thanks.

665
00:47:31,153 --> 00:47:34,239
Daddy's in the back yard tending
the firestorm in the barbecue.

666
00:47:34,405 --> 00:47:38,784
- So you're Nick's daughter.
- Gosh, I hope so, I'm in his will.

667
00:47:38,992 --> 00:47:41,453
Hey, y'all, look who's here.

668
00:47:42,162 --> 00:47:44,288
Hello, Lou.
Hello, Stone.

669
00:47:44,497 --> 00:47:46,290
Check Hollywood for knives.

670
00:47:46,499 --> 00:47:51,128
I don't want him operating on me
later in case I sneeze or something.

671
00:47:52,212 --> 00:47:54,422
Isn't this gonna be fun?

672
00:47:56,257 --> 00:48:00,468
- Oh, no, thank you, I'm a vegetarian.
- I know, dear, but I'm still hopeful.

673
00:48:00,635 --> 00:48:03,096
So am I.
Vegetarian.

674
00:48:03,304 --> 00:48:05,973
- Since when?
- Then have some of this squash, Ben.

675
00:48:06,181 --> 00:48:07,724
Flesh of the earth.
Don't be shy.

676
00:48:07,933 --> 00:48:11,102
I'm not sure I trust a man
who doesn't eat meat.

677
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:15,064
Don't be so provincial.
Where's your sense of adventure?

678
00:48:15,231 --> 00:48:19,860
I'd probably give vegetarians a better rate
for life insurance than a smoker, though.

679
00:48:20,068 --> 00:48:22,820
On account of that
lower cholesterol factor.

680
00:48:22,987 --> 00:48:27,282
Daddy, please, new subject.
We wanna hear all about California.

681
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:30,326
I heard the women out there
have their chests enlarged...

682
00:48:30,535 --> 00:48:33,704
their thighs vacuumed
and barf on purpose.

683
00:48:33,912 --> 00:48:36,039
Not while people are eating.

684
00:48:36,206 --> 00:48:39,542
Yeah, tell us about
real doctoring, Stone.

685
00:48:39,751 --> 00:48:42,420
You know, big-city medicine.

686
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:46,298
So much has changed in the 40 years
since you went to medical school...

687
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:48,133
I wouldn't know
where to start.

688
00:48:49,633 --> 00:48:51,677
- Smart-ass.
- Got you good.

689
00:48:52,219 --> 00:48:55,054
- More squash, Ben?
- No. I mean, no, thank you.

690
00:48:55,889 --> 00:49:01,060
<i>Out of the cradle
Endlessly rocking</i>

691
00:49:01,268 --> 00:49:04,688
<i>Out of the
mockingbird's throat</i>

692
00:49:04,897 --> 00:49:07,648
<i>The musical shuttle</i>

693
00:49:07,857 --> 00:49:09,901
<i>Out of the ninth month</i>

694
00:49:10,109 --> 00:49:13,028
- Is this one of the long ones?
- No.

695
00:49:14,696 --> 00:49:16,490
Long ones?

696
00:49:17,156 --> 00:49:19,533
Doc Hogue does the complete
Walt Whitman...

697
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:22,078
if you don't monitor
his drinking.

698
00:49:22,286 --> 00:49:25,872
<i>Down from the
shower'd halo</i>

699
00:49:26,039 --> 00:49:30,084
<i>Up from the mystical
play of shadows</i>

700
00:49:33,045 --> 00:49:36,380
Man, I haven't seen this
many stars in a long time.

701
00:49:36,881 --> 00:49:40,550
I used to get so bored in this town,
I'd try to count them.

702
00:49:40,884 --> 00:49:42,844
I could've gone
to med school.

703
00:49:43,053 --> 00:49:46,931
Just the science part of it
I had a problem with.

704
00:49:47,139 --> 00:49:49,016
I'd lie on my back,
sometimes Wayne...

705
00:49:49,225 --> 00:49:51,559
would be on top of me
doing the wild thing.

706
00:49:51,768 --> 00:49:54,938
- It was hard not to lose my place.
- God, that's romantic.

707
00:49:55,146 --> 00:49:56,688
Then we moved to Manhattan...

708
00:49:57,064 --> 00:49:59,733
you could hardly see any stars,
let alone count them.

709
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:02,902
The stars I'd like to see are
more of the two-legged kind.

710
00:50:03,111 --> 00:50:05,405
Earthquake insurance
is something I'm keen...

711
00:50:05,613 --> 00:50:07,572
to take a whack
at out there in L.A.

712
00:50:07,781 --> 00:50:09,908
Talk about your no-brainer.

713
00:50:10,075 --> 00:50:14,286
Collect premiums for a gazillion years,
and if the big one ever does hit...

714
00:50:14,453 --> 00:50:17,456
declare bankruptcy and retire.

715
00:50:19,165 --> 00:50:22,085
- Decent and solid.
- Nobody's perfect.

716
00:50:22,293 --> 00:50:24,420
Hank, you gotta
take Hogue home.

717
00:50:24,628 --> 00:50:27,005
He's about to launch
into "Song of Myself. "

718
00:50:27,214 --> 00:50:29,091
My Lord.

719
00:50:29,549 --> 00:50:32,301
Never a dull moment,
hey, Ben Stone?

720
00:50:32,468 --> 00:50:34,345
I'll call you later.

721
00:50:34,721 --> 00:50:36,430
Make sure you got home okay.

722
00:50:54,361 --> 00:50:56,905
- Good night.
- Night.

723
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:35,437
- I forgot my pig.
- She's sleeping with Em.

724
00:51:35,645 --> 00:51:38,105
I'll drop her off in the morning.

725
00:51:38,564 --> 00:51:41,650
Greek death?
Take the edge off.

726
00:51:41,817 --> 00:51:44,069
Take the edge off what?

727
00:51:45,612 --> 00:51:47,238
Me.

728
00:51:50,074 --> 00:51:55,161
- You ran all the way over here.
- Oh, yeah. I ran and...

729
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:58,039
walked.
Got a stitch in my side.

730
00:51:58,206 --> 00:52:00,332
Why are you giving me
the full-court press...

731
00:52:00,499 --> 00:52:03,585
if you're only leaving in
a couple of days anyway?

732
00:52:04,251 --> 00:52:05,878
You know, I don't know.

733
00:52:06,087 --> 00:52:11,174
It's like it's some kind
of mystical force.

734
00:52:11,383 --> 00:52:13,927
Force or hormones?

735
00:52:14,469 --> 00:52:16,678
Hey, come on.

736
00:52:16,887 --> 00:52:19,098
All I wanna do is talk.

737
00:52:21,432 --> 00:52:23,976
And get you sloppy drunk.

738
00:52:24,727 --> 00:52:26,520
Honesty.
That's a new approach.

739
00:52:26,687 --> 00:52:31,733
I know. You're forcing me
into uncharted territory here.

740
00:52:32,692 --> 00:52:35,528
Hell, I might even try chastity.

741
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:39,030
Seems to work for Hank.

742
00:52:43,951 --> 00:52:46,078
Speak of the devil.

743
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:52,208
Listen, maybe a rain check?

744
00:52:54,001 --> 00:52:57,421
I never should have
accepted those flowers.

745
00:53:02,466 --> 00:53:04,009
What about tomorrow night?

746
00:53:04,218 --> 00:53:06,886
Desperation.
I like this.

747
00:53:08,471 --> 00:53:10,982
Still, I...

748
00:53:11,165 --> 00:53:15,454
I wouldn't want the mayor to have to
lose 10 bucks over me, you know?

749
00:53:35,785 --> 00:53:37,162
Morning.

750
00:53:39,955 --> 00:53:41,749
Funny.
Funny.

751
00:53:46,294 --> 00:53:50,589
Morning, doc.
That's a nice pig you got there!

752
00:53:50,922 --> 00:53:52,883
Yeah, that's
what they tell me.

753
00:53:53,050 --> 00:53:58,387
Hey, Mr. McClary, be careful you
don't get another hook in your finger!

754
00:53:58,554 --> 00:54:03,433
Don't worry, doc.
We're not using hooks today.

755
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:17,779
It's all right.
It's all right.

756
00:54:24,367 --> 00:54:28,496
- He's a nice pig, doc.
- It's a she, actually.

757
00:54:33,124 --> 00:54:35,334
Relax, will you?

758
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:39,713
House calls are probably
my favorite part of the job.

759
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:44,842
Just driving out into the country, seeing
what might pop up around the next bend.

760
00:54:45,635 --> 00:54:47,594
Rainbows.

761
00:54:47,886 --> 00:54:49,763
Frost on the kudzu.

762
00:54:50,514 --> 00:54:55,059
John Muir said it, " Most people
are on the world, not in it. "

763
00:54:58,812 --> 00:55:00,105
What?

764
00:55:01,356 --> 00:55:03,148
Nothing.

765
00:55:05,984 --> 00:55:07,695
What?

766
00:55:21,163 --> 00:55:24,083
Listen, you better let me
handle this one alone.

767
00:55:24,291 --> 00:55:27,293
- Obstetrical exam.
- Okay.

768
00:55:28,253 --> 00:55:31,505
"So Jimmy Joe went over to the
Pakistani's house with a shotgun. "

769
00:55:31,714 --> 00:55:35,134
Excuse me.
Jimmy Joe is Ellen's brother?

770
00:55:35,342 --> 00:55:37,468
No, no.
Boyfriend.

771
00:55:38,052 --> 00:55:40,263
I was stumped on
that one too.

772
00:55:40,471 --> 00:55:43,640
"He stayed outside shooting holes
in the fella's foreign car...

773
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:46,727
until Ellen came out and agreed
to come back home with him.

774
00:55:46,934 --> 00:55:50,271
It's the most romantic thing
Jimmy Joe has ever done for her. "

775
00:55:56,276 --> 00:55:57,736
Tough one.

776
00:55:57,944 --> 00:56:01,530
How's Ellen making out
with the Pakistani man?

777
00:56:04,532 --> 00:56:06,075
Get him, get him.
Come on, Bubba.

778
00:56:08,619 --> 00:56:12,456
I said...
I said, no shots.

779
00:56:22,756 --> 00:56:24,632
This won't hurt.

780
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:27,551
Well, I don't see an infection.

781
00:56:27,843 --> 00:56:29,636
But...

782
00:56:32,221 --> 00:56:34,349
Okay, hold still.

783
00:56:38,644 --> 00:56:41,313
- What is that, a V8?
- He did it.

784
00:56:43,898 --> 00:56:47,568
You know, house calls used to be
essential to every doctor's practice.

785
00:56:47,735 --> 00:56:50,737
The only way to know your patients
was to see where they live.

786
00:56:50,945 --> 00:56:52,989
How they lived.

787
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:55,449
Maybe when I get
to Halberstrom's...

788
00:56:55,658 --> 00:56:58,661
I'll get them to institute some
kind of visitation program.

789
00:56:58,869 --> 00:57:00,161
Damn it.

790
00:57:04,832 --> 00:57:06,541
Lou?

791
00:57:09,878 --> 00:57:11,504
Hey, Lou!

792
00:57:15,091 --> 00:57:17,759
Do you see another one?
They mark their way with these.

793
00:57:17,968 --> 00:57:22,012
They're too stupid or too drunk to
remember where they were most times.

794
00:57:22,179 --> 00:57:24,682
- Who?
- Hunters.

795
00:57:25,391 --> 00:57:28,643
Maybe this is the end of...
Yeah. See, there it is.

796
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:31,270
That's where they sit
and wait for the slaughter.

797
00:57:31,437 --> 00:57:35,816
It's not like they do it for food either.
God, it gets me so hot.

798
00:57:40,903 --> 00:57:43,197
You wanna help me here?

799
00:57:43,739 --> 00:57:45,115
What are you doing?

800
00:57:46,116 --> 00:57:47,575
I'm urinating.

801
00:57:49,035 --> 00:57:51,954
You just drop trou
whenever you feel like it.

802
00:57:52,162 --> 00:57:56,124
Well, it scares the deer away
so the hunters won't get them.

803
00:57:58,126 --> 00:58:00,877
Why don't you just, you know,
say "boo" or something?

804
00:58:01,044 --> 00:58:04,881
I try to spread it around.
A little here, a little there.

805
00:58:06,507 --> 00:58:08,884
Feel free to join in.

806
00:58:31,611 --> 00:58:35,406
Anyway, it's not like I planned
to be pregnant at 19...

807
00:58:35,614 --> 00:58:37,658
but it could have been
worse than Wayne.

808
00:58:37,867 --> 00:58:39,993
Wendall Barnes.

809
00:58:40,201 --> 00:58:41,578
You'd be interested in him.

810
00:58:41,745 --> 00:58:44,914
He comes from a whole family
that doesn't have sweat glands.

811
00:58:45,123 --> 00:58:48,208
Really? I'm fascinated
by the gland-less.

812
00:58:48,417 --> 00:58:49,710
I guess it's genetic.

813
00:58:49,918 --> 00:58:53,421
During the summer, they all sleep under
the house on account of the heat.

814
00:58:53,588 --> 00:58:56,923
That's a touching story. Really.
Thanks for sharing that with me.

815
00:58:57,090 --> 00:59:00,844
You don't see a lot of things in Grady,
but what you do see, you see a lot of.

816
00:59:01,011 --> 00:59:03,054
Yeah, I'm from a
small town myself.

817
00:59:03,512 --> 00:59:05,139
What?

818
00:59:06,641 --> 00:59:11,353
Marionville, Indiana.
Population: 2106.

819
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:14,605
Home of the world's
largest steam engine.

820
00:59:15,147 --> 00:59:16,774
But you told everybody
that you...

821
00:59:16,982 --> 00:59:20,818
No, no, no. Everybody assumed
I was a big-city guy.

822
00:59:21,027 --> 00:59:23,321
Nobody asked.

823
00:59:23,529 --> 00:59:26,114
Anyway, I got out,
and I'm staying out.

824
00:59:28,575 --> 00:59:31,160
Have you still got
your whole family there?

825
00:59:31,369 --> 00:59:33,746
Well, they talked
about leaving...

826
00:59:33,955 --> 00:59:36,706
but my dad never quite...

827
00:59:37,791 --> 00:59:40,043
They lived there,
they died there.

828
00:59:40,251 --> 00:59:42,461
For better or for worse.

829
00:59:43,003 --> 00:59:47,382
So when I left home, I swore to
myself I was never going back.

830
00:59:48,341 --> 00:59:51,010
It's not the place,
it's the person.

831
00:59:51,970 --> 00:59:55,222
Be careful what you wish for,
Ben Stone, you might get it.

832
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:56,974
What's that supposed to mean?

833
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:59,809
You never been back,
not even to see your friends?

834
00:59:59,976 --> 01:00:03,228
Well, who's got
time for friends?

835
01:00:07,774 --> 01:00:11,110
No, you gotta get Dr. Stone
back here ASAP.

836
01:00:11,318 --> 01:00:13,445
We got a possible
coronary emergency.

837
01:00:13,654 --> 01:00:17,615
- Can't Doc Hogue handle this?
- It is Hogue. Over.

838
01:00:21,535 --> 01:00:23,996
- Hey, lie down.
- Oh, crap, I'm doomed.

839
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:26,330
Lie down now.
You're having a heart attack.

840
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:28,582
My angina's acting up is all.

841
01:00:28,749 --> 01:00:31,918
- Got any nitro pills down there?
- No, get a bolus of Lidocaine.

842
01:00:32,085 --> 01:00:34,421
I'm the senior sawbones
around here.

843
01:00:34,629 --> 01:00:37,965
PVCs are too close to your T-waves.
In 30 seconds, you're in trouble.

844
01:00:38,173 --> 01:00:39,633
Get him away from me.

845
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:43,469
If I'm wrong, Lidocaine won't hurt.
If you're wrong, it's a ventricular fib.

846
01:00:43,678 --> 01:00:45,305
I'm never wrong.

847
01:00:46,848 --> 01:00:49,266
Get the defibrillator over here.

848
01:00:49,558 --> 01:00:51,018
Never wrong.

849
01:00:51,226 --> 01:00:53,270
Four hundred watts.

850
01:00:53,561 --> 01:00:54,854
Clear.
Clear!

851
01:00:57,523 --> 01:00:59,149
Heartbeat.

852
01:00:59,316 --> 01:01:02,652
- Sixty. - Wow, you mean
he actually has one.

853
01:01:02,861 --> 01:01:05,404
Keep him on oxygen and
set the Lidocaine drip.

854
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:08,490
Guess I'm staying here tonight.

855
01:01:21,917 --> 01:01:23,461
Oh, doctor.

856
01:01:23,669 --> 01:01:25,963
I've got your bed ready.

857
01:01:28,214 --> 01:01:29,758
Right.

858
01:01:33,928 --> 01:01:35,220
Sleep well, doctor.

859
01:01:43,685 --> 01:01:46,063
At which point, all the bees,
including Melvin...

860
01:01:46,229 --> 01:01:48,690
lunged off the edge of
the stage like lemmings.

861
01:01:48,899 --> 01:01:51,734
- A standing ovation.
- Variations on a theme.

862
01:01:51,943 --> 01:01:53,319
Sorry I missed it.

863
01:01:53,527 --> 01:01:56,947
That's the first squash pageant
that I missed in 15 years.

864
01:01:57,155 --> 01:01:58,531
What's going on here?

865
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:02,785
It's called moral support
for the recovering patient.

866
01:02:02,993 --> 01:02:04,453
Cherry cobbler, Ben?

867
01:02:04,662 --> 01:02:08,706
Everybody out. Let's go.
Come on, visiting hours are over.

868
01:02:08,915 --> 01:02:13,627
Don't mind Doc Hollywood. He doesn't
know what it means to be beloved.

869
01:02:15,504 --> 01:02:19,173
If you've come to clean the room,
my bedpan's ripe.

870
01:02:23,885 --> 01:02:27,222
Oh, no.
Not Maddie's sweet potato pie.

871
01:02:27,389 --> 01:02:30,057
You can razz me
all you want, doc.

872
01:02:30,516 --> 01:02:33,269
I saved your life last night.

873
01:02:33,519 --> 01:02:36,437
You know it, and I know it.

874
01:02:37,438 --> 01:02:39,231
Gotcha.

875
01:04:11,098 --> 01:04:14,267
Dr. Halberstrom, please.
It's Ben Stone calling.

876
01:04:15,143 --> 01:04:17,354
It's regarding...

877
01:04:17,938 --> 01:04:22,566
I'm not gonna be able to
make my interview on Friday.

878
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:28,363
I realize the doctor has a tight schedule.
I'm not gonna be able to leave without...

879
01:04:30,448 --> 01:04:31,740
Right.

880
01:04:31,949 --> 01:04:35,994
Is there any way that he can reschedule
the appointment for another time?

881
01:04:36,786 --> 01:04:39,538
All right.
Thanks a lot.

882
01:05:08,771 --> 01:05:12,190
Here you go. Get hot and take a shot.
Get hot and take a shot.

883
01:05:12,399 --> 01:05:14,025
What's the object
of this one, pal?

884
01:05:14,234 --> 01:05:16,569
Ten shots a dollar.
Five bull's-eyes win a possum.

885
01:05:16,777 --> 01:05:20,364
- Suppose I was to hit five out of five.
- I'll give you two possums.

886
01:05:29,121 --> 01:05:33,833
Sir, run Henry a tab.
He feels deadly today.

887
01:05:36,252 --> 01:05:38,753
Evening, Dr. Stone.

888
01:05:51,973 --> 01:05:53,349
Hey, doc.

889
01:05:56,226 --> 01:05:59,396
The new one's in.
Your chariot's good as new.

890
01:05:59,563 --> 01:06:01,939
Or good as new used,
since it's old.

891
01:06:02,148 --> 01:06:05,067
- You fixed my car?
- Even all the ashtrays.

892
01:06:05,233 --> 01:06:07,444
Oh, man, I can't believe this.

893
01:06:07,611 --> 01:06:08,904
Melvin, thanks, man.

894
01:06:11,196 --> 01:06:12,990
There's always some
extra parts...

895
01:06:13,157 --> 01:06:15,534
when I put them back together.
I don't know why.

896
01:06:15,743 --> 01:06:19,078
But you go ahead on.
Keep them.

897
01:06:23,665 --> 01:06:25,876
- Dance with me or I'm dog food.
- What?

898
01:06:26,084 --> 01:06:29,420
- Wendall Barnes.
- Of the gland-less Barnes?

899
01:06:29,629 --> 01:06:31,923
- Jesus.
- Yeah. Come on.

900
01:06:32,131 --> 01:06:34,382
Absolutely.

901
01:06:49,770 --> 01:06:51,563
You see, the trick...

902
01:06:52,231 --> 01:06:56,359
is just to visualize the target
on the backs of your eyeballs...

903
01:06:56,567 --> 01:07:01,488
and then pretend you're just
shooting yourself in the eye.

904
01:07:09,036 --> 01:07:11,330
I can't keep up.

905
01:07:30,011 --> 01:07:31,721
How's Hogue?

906
01:07:31,888 --> 01:07:33,515
Meaner than ever.

907
01:07:40,562 --> 01:07:42,355
Dance?

908
01:07:48,652 --> 01:07:50,612
Where's Hank?

909
01:07:50,904 --> 01:07:52,780
I forget.

910
01:09:55,381 --> 01:09:57,424
The music stopped.

911
01:09:58,008 --> 01:09:59,884
What music?

912
01:10:03,888 --> 01:10:05,681
Dr. Stone.

913
01:10:06,139 --> 01:10:09,309
- I have a present for you.
- Thanks, judge.

914
01:10:09,518 --> 01:10:13,396
I want to thank you for saving
my old friend Hogue's miserable life.

915
01:10:13,604 --> 01:10:15,897
I wouldn't be able to
call myself a Christian...

916
01:10:16,064 --> 01:10:18,817
if I didn't pardon you on the
remainder of your sentence.

917
01:10:19,025 --> 01:10:21,069
You're free to go
whenever you want.

918
01:10:21,236 --> 01:10:23,445
What I wouldn't give to
be young on the road...

919
01:10:23,612 --> 01:10:26,448
footloose and fancy-free.

920
01:10:26,615 --> 01:10:29,784
Did I tell you? I've already
got plans for a new fence.

921
01:10:29,993 --> 01:10:32,328
All of a sudden,
I got a bug in my ear...

922
01:10:32,537 --> 01:10:35,789
for one of those solid-oak
numbers with curly tops.

923
01:10:38,249 --> 01:10:39,959
Victory.

924
01:10:40,126 --> 01:10:42,336
Did you kill that critter
all by yourself?

925
01:10:42,545 --> 01:10:44,004
Very funny.

926
01:10:44,212 --> 01:10:48,925
Don't you have some urgent business
thousands of miles away from here?

927
01:10:49,134 --> 01:10:53,095
Vialula, your daughter was dumping
grasshoppers in the punch bowl again.

928
01:10:53,304 --> 01:10:54,388
Only two.

929
01:10:54,597 --> 01:11:00,351
- Shake a leg with the judicial branch?
- Why, I'd love to. Thank you.

930
01:11:00,976 --> 01:11:02,436
Would you hold this possum?

931
01:11:02,603 --> 01:11:06,105
I think it's time I reacquainted
your mama with some real dancing.

932
01:11:06,314 --> 01:11:08,983
No offense, Hollywood.

933
01:11:14,738 --> 01:11:17,281
When you gonna bring
your pig back around?

934
01:11:26,831 --> 01:11:29,750
Hey there, Ben Stone.
Hey, how are you?

935
01:11:29,917 --> 01:11:32,127
Been looking for you.
What a great day.

936
01:11:32,294 --> 01:11:34,837
Boy, this is it.

937
01:11:35,046 --> 01:11:38,466
The pinnacle of existence,
the grandeur of Grady.

938
01:11:38,633 --> 01:11:40,842
Sap of life.
Couldn't be happier if I was twins.

939
01:11:41,051 --> 01:11:44,970
- You put on a hell of a festival, mayor.
- Ain't you nice to say so.

940
01:11:45,179 --> 01:11:49,099
Ben, let's talk turkey.
Or squash, as it were.

941
01:11:49,308 --> 01:11:51,643
- About what?
- Home.

942
01:11:51,851 --> 01:11:53,144
Heart.

943
01:11:53,353 --> 01:11:54,896
Happiness.

944
01:11:55,063 --> 01:11:56,772
You belong here, Ben Stone.

945
01:11:56,980 --> 01:12:00,901
Breaks my heart to think of you
out there in the land of lunatics.

946
01:12:01,109 --> 01:12:04,445
I'm danged if I'll let you go without
holding up a mirror to your face.

947
01:12:04,654 --> 01:12:08,698
Like that smile of contentment there.
So you see that? See there?

948
01:12:08,865 --> 01:12:13,077
That's a face that's liked and loved.
A face with friends and a future.

949
01:12:13,244 --> 01:12:15,704
Can't find some other
way to force me to stay?

950
01:12:15,913 --> 01:12:17,289
Ben.

951
01:12:17,456 --> 01:12:19,332
I am everything but devious.

952
01:12:19,499 --> 01:12:23,002
Mayor, could you come check these
ribs and tell me if they're done?

953
01:12:23,211 --> 01:12:24,920
I sure can.

954
01:12:25,128 --> 01:12:27,339
Rigors of the job, huh?

955
01:12:27,756 --> 01:12:32,135
Well, you got your fire way too high,
I'll tell you that.

956
01:12:32,635 --> 01:12:34,011
Well, don't do that.

957
01:12:36,096 --> 01:12:39,182
Come on, come on.

958
01:12:41,725 --> 01:12:44,019
- Hi, doc.
- Gentlemen.

959
01:13:20,841 --> 01:13:23,135
Careful with those things.

960
01:13:40,024 --> 01:13:43,902
I know I shouldn't be doing this because
you're leaving, but I don't care.

961
01:13:44,110 --> 01:13:45,987
I can't help it.

962
01:13:46,196 --> 01:13:47,821
So get in.

963
01:13:48,155 --> 01:13:52,201
- Do you mean what I think you mean?
- Just get in if you're gonna get in.

964
01:13:58,705 --> 01:14:01,541
Lou, I gotta be
honest with you.

965
01:14:01,708 --> 01:14:04,543
Rowing a boat is not
what I had in mind.

966
01:14:08,964 --> 01:14:10,673
Not bad, huh?

967
01:14:14,093 --> 01:14:15,385
Incredible.

968
01:14:17,262 --> 01:14:19,598
- What was that?
- Freshwater mullet.

969
01:14:19,807 --> 01:14:24,018
They see the sparks from the skyrockets,
think it's food and jump for it.

970
01:14:24,227 --> 01:14:26,270
That's scary.

971
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:28,563
Maybe I could...

972
01:14:29,064 --> 01:14:31,274
sit next to you,
and you could protect me.

973
01:14:31,441 --> 01:14:33,567
No.
You'll throw us off balance.

974
01:14:33,734 --> 01:14:35,945
I want you off balance.

975
01:14:36,153 --> 01:14:38,113
- He's in the boat!
- Hold still.

976
01:14:38,321 --> 01:14:40,281
- Get him.
- Watch it, you'll tip us over.

977
01:14:40,490 --> 01:14:42,617
- Get him, Lou.
- Okay, I got it.

978
01:14:47,454 --> 01:14:49,831
You did that on purpose.

979
01:14:50,832 --> 01:14:53,334
All right, I admit it.

980
01:14:53,835 --> 01:14:57,629
I worked my way through
college by training bass.

981
01:15:21,274 --> 01:15:22,649
Lou?

982
01:15:23,191 --> 01:15:25,068
It's okay.

983
01:15:25,944 --> 01:15:28,362
Listen, if you don't wanna...

984
01:15:28,946 --> 01:15:32,992
Ben, I don't think I've ever wanted
anything more in my entire life, ever.

985
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:37,120
I'm just not used to being
a one-night stand.

986
01:15:39,830 --> 01:15:42,916
You don't have to be.
I mean, I could...

987
01:15:43,125 --> 01:15:46,752
No. I wouldn't know what to
do with myself in Los Angeles.

988
01:15:46,961 --> 01:15:49,464
There are too many choices.

989
01:15:51,047 --> 01:15:53,717
Let's not think about it, okay?

990
01:15:59,346 --> 01:16:01,473
I can't do this.

991
01:16:13,691 --> 01:16:18,320
Mind walking from here? I don't wanna
give the gossips any more fat to chew.

992
01:16:20,864 --> 01:16:22,574
Right.

993
01:16:23,450 --> 01:16:26,452
Don't worry, Benjamin,
it'll all work out.

994
01:16:46,093 --> 01:16:48,053
Hey, Jasmine.

995
01:17:09,278 --> 01:17:10,822
Hey, Hank.

996
01:17:11,781 --> 01:17:15,450
You've made me real mad.

997
01:17:17,119 --> 01:17:18,662
About what?

998
01:17:18,829 --> 01:17:20,788
What do you think?

999
01:17:20,996 --> 01:17:24,166
I know you were out
on that lake with her.

1000
01:17:24,458 --> 01:17:27,794
It makes me sick to
think of you and her.

1001
01:17:28,002 --> 01:17:30,379
- Nothing happened.
- Oh, right.

1002
01:17:30,587 --> 01:17:32,714
Nothing happened!

1003
01:17:32,923 --> 01:17:35,050
Come on, tough guy!
Come on, country boy!

1004
01:17:35,259 --> 01:17:38,010
You wanna take a shot at me, huh?
Come on!

1005
01:17:38,177 --> 01:17:40,930
- What are you doing?
- Come on, country boy, get up! Let's go.

1006
01:17:41,555 --> 01:17:43,181
Are you paranoid
or something?

1007
01:17:45,851 --> 01:17:47,476
No.

1008
01:17:48,269 --> 01:17:50,479
But I'm a little confused.

1009
01:17:58,652 --> 01:18:01,071
I suppose you and her will
be getting married now.

1010
01:18:07,702 --> 01:18:09,745
It's the Southern way.

1011
01:18:09,953 --> 01:18:12,622
Man and woman as one.

1012
01:18:12,998 --> 01:18:18,419
Make sacrifices to build equity
in a future that has security.

1013
01:18:18,919 --> 01:18:21,463
Why do you sound like
a Mutual of Omaha ad?

1014
01:18:21,796 --> 01:18:23,840
Fine, joke it up.

1015
01:18:24,007 --> 01:18:26,216
At least I was
prepared to marry her.

1016
01:18:28,886 --> 01:18:30,429
She's not in love with you.

1017
01:18:31,596 --> 01:18:34,265
Okay. That's the only
roadblock, though.

1018
01:18:37,976 --> 01:18:40,020
Let me ask you something.

1019
01:18:40,979 --> 01:18:44,815
Don't you think a guy is entitled
to choose his own destiny?

1020
01:18:45,441 --> 01:18:48,110
Whether it's in a small town
or even in California.

1021
01:18:48,318 --> 01:18:50,737
It's just that he shouldn't
have it handed to him.

1022
01:18:50,945 --> 01:18:54,281
Not like it's a...
You know, like...

1023
01:18:54,490 --> 01:18:56,116
A hat?

1024
01:18:58,243 --> 01:19:00,536
Right. Okay, good.
Like a hat.

1025
01:19:00,745 --> 01:19:03,998
Your father and your grandfather wore it,
now you're stuck with it.

1026
01:19:04,207 --> 01:19:06,875
Only the damn thing is too small.
It just doesn't fit.

1027
01:19:07,084 --> 01:19:12,296
- I hate a tight hat.
- There's a lot of hats out there.

1028
01:19:12,588 --> 01:19:16,257
And even if this one fits...

1029
01:19:16,466 --> 01:19:18,259
and I'm not saying
that it does...

1030
01:19:18,426 --> 01:19:22,471
how do you know it's the right one
when you haven't tried any others on?

1031
01:19:22,679 --> 01:19:24,890
I sure haven't.

1032
01:19:26,475 --> 01:19:28,851
I mean, that's what
I'm talking about.

1033
01:19:29,977 --> 01:19:32,730
I just don't wanna
screw up her life.

1034
01:19:33,939 --> 01:19:36,066
You know, Hollywood...

1035
01:19:36,233 --> 01:19:40,528
sometimes a man's gotta
do what a man's gotta do.

1036
01:19:40,736 --> 01:19:45,615
And maybe...
Maybe it's in California.

1037
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:50,077
Yeah, maybe you're right.

1038
01:19:51,328 --> 01:19:55,373
- Well, I'm glad we got that cleaned up.
- Me too, Hank.

1039
01:19:55,581 --> 01:19:58,042
Don't that take the
rag off the bush?

1040
01:19:58,251 --> 01:20:00,628
Don't forget what I told you.

1041
01:21:04,138 --> 01:21:05,431
Hey, please!

1042
01:21:09,267 --> 01:21:11,227
Shit.

1043
01:21:20,359 --> 01:21:22,320
Shit.

1044
01:21:22,528 --> 01:21:24,237
Shit.

1045
01:21:36,289 --> 01:21:38,083
Dr. Stone.

1046
01:21:38,249 --> 01:21:40,377
Mary. Decided to drop by,
see how you were doing.

1047
01:21:40,543 --> 01:21:44,671
No damn good. Water's broke. I hurt.
This ain't like none of the others.

1048
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:46,839
They never are.

1049
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:50,927
Did Doc Hogue tell you this baby
might come out the wrong way?

1050
01:21:52,177 --> 01:21:54,846
He's coming.
He don't care which way.

1051
01:21:56,556 --> 01:21:59,892
- Fiddlesticks. Don't push, Mary.
- I can run, get an ambulance.

1052
01:22:00,059 --> 01:22:03,728
There's no time for that. Go into my
duffle bag, there's four clean shirts.

1053
01:22:03,895 --> 01:22:06,731
Get them and rip them
into even pieces.

1054
01:22:07,607 --> 01:22:11,443
Listen, Mary, don't push. I know
you want to, but don't push.

1055
01:22:11,652 --> 01:22:14,154
I'll try to turn him around
so he comes the right way.

1056
01:22:14,821 --> 01:22:16,781
Is it these ones?

1057
01:22:16,948 --> 01:22:21,410
- "Aramana"?
- Armani. Those are the ones.

1058
01:22:25,830 --> 01:22:29,709
Okay, now. Now! That's it.
Great. Great. Great.

1059
01:22:29,917 --> 01:22:32,043
Okay, okay, okay.

1060
01:22:32,752 --> 01:22:36,339
Now go! Push. Push, Mary.
You're doing great.

1061
01:22:36,548 --> 01:22:38,674
You're doing great.

1062
01:22:39,174 --> 01:22:41,218
I got a leg.
I got a leg.

1063
01:22:49,391 --> 01:22:52,811
All right.
Go ahead, go ahead.

1064
01:22:53,394 --> 01:22:55,271
Someone's coming.

1065
01:22:55,438 --> 01:22:58,441
Doc, someone's coming.

1066
01:22:59,274 --> 01:23:01,234
Okay, all right.

1067
01:23:06,030 --> 01:23:07,990
Push!
Push, Mary!

1068
01:23:17,873 --> 01:23:19,166
Doc, your car.

1069
01:23:21,459 --> 01:23:23,002
What do I do?

1070
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:26,130
Okay.

1071
01:23:27,380 --> 01:23:29,632
- Good girl!
- What do I do?

1072
01:23:29,841 --> 01:23:31,134
Push, Mary.

1073
01:23:35,262 --> 01:23:36,889
It's a girl!

1074
01:24:12,167 --> 01:24:14,711
I think I can fix that.

1075
01:24:30,015 --> 01:24:33,102
- You rang?
- First breech you ever delivered?

1076
01:24:34,686 --> 01:24:36,938
First baby I ever delivered.

1077
01:24:37,146 --> 01:24:38,439
By myself.

1078
01:24:39,398 --> 01:24:41,942
- Whiskey?
- No, thanks.

1079
01:24:42,150 --> 01:24:44,653
In fact, I wouldn't recommend
that for you, either.

1080
01:24:44,860 --> 01:24:47,530
You're not my doctor,
and you're not my wife...

1081
01:24:47,697 --> 01:24:50,782
so I guess you don't have
very much to say about it.

1082
01:24:53,201 --> 01:24:56,120
You're not fixing
to stay, huh, Stone?

1083
01:24:56,286 --> 01:24:58,580
Changed your mind, huh?

1084
01:24:58,789 --> 01:25:01,457
Now that your car's
all busted to bubkes...

1085
01:25:01,624 --> 01:25:05,378
and you're feeling pretty good
about yourself in general, huh?

1086
01:25:07,254 --> 01:25:08,547
Come here.

1087
01:25:16,846 --> 01:25:19,222
I had them up once.

1088
01:25:19,389 --> 01:25:23,309
Over 700 babies I delivered
in this town over the years.

1089
01:25:23,518 --> 01:25:24,810
Nurse Packer.

1090
01:25:25,019 --> 01:25:30,064
She popped right out complete with
teeth and hair and bit me. An omen.

1091
01:25:30,273 --> 01:25:31,566
Nicholson.

1092
01:25:31,774 --> 01:25:33,484
Hank.

1093
01:25:34,485 --> 01:25:39,406
I gave them birth, saw them
through every sneeze and sniffle...

1094
01:25:39,614 --> 01:25:42,950
and sometimes even walked
them to the gravesite.

1095
01:25:43,701 --> 01:25:47,620
They're pretty well
my portfolio, Stone.

1096
01:25:47,829 --> 01:25:52,207
That and an old car,
an old house.

1097
01:25:52,583 --> 01:25:55,836
I wouldn't trade any
of them for gold.

1098
01:25:56,670 --> 01:25:58,880
Well, maybe gold.

1099
01:25:59,547 --> 01:26:01,841
Or cash money.

1100
01:26:05,427 --> 01:26:07,304
- Hey.
- Doc.

1101
01:26:08,304 --> 01:26:10,181
Hey, Mary, how's our girl?

1102
01:26:10,348 --> 01:26:14,184
We decided she's gonna be
"Benjamina," after you.

1103
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:16,936
What?

1104
01:26:17,729 --> 01:26:19,521
Thank you.

1105
01:26:20,022 --> 01:26:23,192
There's an obstetrician coming
up from Athens General later...

1106
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:25,860
just to make sure
everything's okay.

1107
01:26:27,111 --> 01:26:28,738
Benjamina.

1108
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:35,118
Yo, doc, I wanted to just thank
you for, you know, everything...

1109
01:26:35,285 --> 01:26:38,287
so I made you this
in appreciation.

1110
01:26:38,996 --> 01:26:44,334
I know it ain't very much, so if there's
ever anything at all I can do for you...

1111
01:26:44,501 --> 01:26:48,962
Just let me know what happens
with Ellen, Jimmy Joe and the Pakistani.

1112
01:27:09,063 --> 01:27:11,272
I heard what happened last night.
You did great.

1113
01:27:12,065 --> 01:27:16,360
- I didn't know what I was doing.
- Well, sometimes that's the best way.

1114
01:27:17,820 --> 01:27:19,780
There's something
that I wanted to say.

1115
01:27:19,947 --> 01:27:23,908
Something I wanted to say
to you first. Is that okay?

1116
01:27:24,534 --> 01:27:28,996
So I've been doing a lot of
thinking about last night.

1117
01:27:29,162 --> 01:27:32,081
Last night was really difficult.

1118
01:27:32,373 --> 01:27:37,253
Everything's all turned around now.
I've been thinking about you and me...

1119
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:40,964
and big cities, small towns...
Well, I'm gonna marry Hank.

1120
01:27:43,132 --> 01:27:45,175
I've decided.

1121
01:27:49,304 --> 01:27:51,347
It's a plane ticket
to Los Angeles.

1122
01:27:51,973 --> 01:27:53,850
The whole town chipped in.

1123
01:27:54,017 --> 01:27:58,937
We've kept you here this long, and if you
wait for Melvin to fix your car again...

1124
01:28:01,105 --> 01:28:03,357
You got Los Angeles
waiting for you.

1125
01:28:03,566 --> 01:28:06,568
I've got Emma.
It's not fair to you.

1126
01:28:06,776 --> 01:28:09,696
Hank's steady, and he's here.

1127
01:28:09,904 --> 01:28:11,613
You...

1128
01:28:12,406 --> 01:28:16,451
You're like a big, bright shooting star and
you're right, Ben, you'd burn out here.

1129
01:28:22,039 --> 01:28:23,665
Wait a minute.

1130
01:28:29,295 --> 01:28:32,548
Well, Ben Stone, you have five minutes
to say goodbye to Shangri-la.

1131
01:28:32,715 --> 01:28:36,217
Cotton will give you a police
escort to the airport.

1132
01:28:43,682 --> 01:28:46,059
We made you a sack lunch.

1133
01:28:46,225 --> 01:28:48,603
Airplane food can cause gas.

1134
01:28:54,733 --> 01:28:56,942
I guess I'll watch
after your pig.

1135
01:28:57,151 --> 01:29:00,488
Just hope she takes to the farm
after living in town like this.

1136
01:29:01,196 --> 01:29:03,156
Appreciate it.

1137
01:29:03,615 --> 01:29:06,117
A lot of folks around
here gonna miss you.

1138
01:29:06,992 --> 01:29:10,496
I don't mean me.
But a lot of folks.

1139
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:43,940
Adieu.

1140
01:29:52,738 --> 01:29:55,491
Back to the interstate,
Ben Stone, huh?

1141
01:29:55,658 --> 01:29:57,117
Back to the interstate.

1142
01:31:28,776 --> 01:31:30,736
You okay?

1143
01:31:31,611 --> 01:31:34,113
Oh, yes, I am fine.

1144
01:31:39,076 --> 01:31:42,787
Good morning, Halberstrom Clinic.
Could you hold, please.

1145
01:31:42,995 --> 01:31:47,041
Good morning, Halberstrom Clinic.
Good morning, Halberstrom Clinic.

1146
01:31:48,458 --> 01:31:50,669
Oh, hold.
Yes, doctor.

1147
01:31:51,503 --> 01:31:53,712
- Mr. Stone?
- Dr. Stone.

1148
01:31:55,923 --> 01:31:57,967
Dr. Halberstrom
can see you now.

1149
01:32:12,687 --> 01:32:15,939
Do you have any idea how many
applications I went through this year?

1150
01:32:16,147 --> 01:32:18,984
Yes, sir. That's why I knew
this interview was important.

1151
01:32:19,150 --> 01:32:21,986
I would've been here earlier
if I could've been. I think...

1152
01:32:22,152 --> 01:32:26,699
I know you're a great surgeon, Stone.
That whole pile is full of great surgeons.

1153
01:32:27,115 --> 01:32:28,992
Did you expect
special consideration...

1154
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:31,160
because we're from
the same hometown?

1155
01:32:31,369 --> 01:32:33,495
- Because I knew your father?
- No, sir.

1156
01:32:33,704 --> 01:32:36,373
Good.
Because you didn't get shit.

1157
01:32:36,540 --> 01:32:40,918
You wouldn't be here at all if it weren't
for a call I got from Dr. Aurelius Hogue.

1158
01:32:43,296 --> 01:32:44,754
Dr. Hogue called you?

1159
01:32:44,963 --> 01:32:47,966
I saw two doctors last week
with more experience than you...

1160
01:32:48,174 --> 01:32:50,843
and better board
certification scores.

1161
01:32:52,136 --> 01:32:55,138
Dr. Hogue's a piece
of work, isn't he?

1162
01:32:55,513 --> 01:32:56,889
What did he say?

1163
01:32:57,056 --> 01:33:00,809
That you were doing volunteer family
practice down South somewhere.

1164
01:33:02,936 --> 01:33:06,814
Yes. Yeah.
Yes, yes, that's right.

1165
01:33:07,607 --> 01:33:11,277
Went there to get that small-town
chip off your shoulder, didn't you?

1166
01:33:11,444 --> 01:33:15,572
- Yeah. - Well, you're
braver than I was, Stone.

1167
01:33:15,739 --> 01:33:18,908
Any case,
Hogue said you were, quote:

1168
01:33:19,074 --> 01:33:22,994
"One hellaciously fine physician. "

1169
01:33:23,202 --> 01:33:27,040
That I would be " a bovine,
clodpated, citified moron"...

1170
01:33:27,206 --> 01:33:29,625
if I didn't hire
you on the spot.

1171
01:33:29,833 --> 01:33:31,793
I wrote it down so
I wouldn't forget.

1172
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:34,712
So I guess you're in, Stone.
Congrats.

1173
01:33:34,879 --> 01:33:36,839
What time do I tee off?

1174
01:33:37,048 --> 01:33:39,258
You do play golf, don't you?

1175
01:33:39,466 --> 01:33:42,802
Great. Don't worry about that.
It's not anywhere you can see it.

1176
01:33:42,969 --> 01:33:46,847
The secret to this business is to
get a good pace going for yourself.

1177
01:33:47,056 --> 01:33:50,892
Nobody likes to admit it,
but medicine's a volume business.

1178
01:33:51,059 --> 01:33:53,728
Ninety-nine percent of what
we do is boilerplate surgery.

1179
01:33:53,937 --> 01:33:56,772
It means we can afford the
one percent that's meaningful.

1180
01:33:56,939 --> 01:34:00,651
Disfigurements, birth defects,
hare lips.

1181
01:34:01,693 --> 01:34:04,946
Cleft palates.
You live for those moments.

1182
01:34:05,154 --> 01:34:07,281
The bigger you get,
the bigger the nut.

1183
01:34:07,447 --> 01:34:11,243
We're a service industry. Comes with
the territory. Fixed costs, specialization.

1184
01:34:11,451 --> 01:34:14,203
People adjust to it or fail.
Look at cable TV.

1185
01:34:14,370 --> 01:34:16,580
You're gonna see
some changes, Stone.

1186
01:34:17,248 --> 01:34:21,709
Stone, see if patient number
434 is in preop yet.

1187
01:34:21,876 --> 01:34:25,212
We can squeeze one more in
before lunch, don't you think?

1188
01:35:05,078 --> 01:35:08,248
Hi. This is the National
Weather Service forecast...

1189
01:35:08,415 --> 01:35:10,791
for the greater Grady
area tomorrow.

1190
01:35:10,958 --> 01:35:13,961
There'll be plenty of
sunshine and blue skies.

1191
01:35:14,128 --> 01:35:16,880
The old temperature
should be in the 90s again...

1192
01:35:17,046 --> 01:35:21,341
but a cool afternoon breeze will
make it all worthwhile come evening.

1193
01:35:21,508 --> 01:35:25,386
Y'all look out for the lightning
bugs after sunset.

1194
01:35:45,153 --> 01:35:47,530
- Actress alert.
- Excuse me.

1195
01:35:47,738 --> 01:35:49,615
Some girl called for you.

1196
01:35:49,823 --> 01:35:54,452
Said you'd know who it was,
said she'd meet you at this bar.

1197
01:35:55,328 --> 01:35:59,623
Like, as if you're gonna rush
right over there. Right.

1198
01:35:59,789 --> 01:36:05,211
Totally unbelievable Southern accent.
An actress, I'll bet.

1199
01:36:36,028 --> 01:36:39,781
- Hi. Can I help you?
- I'm supposed to meet someone, a girl.

1200
01:36:40,490 --> 01:36:42,450
Ben.

1201
01:36:49,830 --> 01:36:51,958
Nancy Lee?

1202
01:36:56,503 --> 01:37:02,341
Well, I had to give it a shot, you know.
I just thought, just in case.

1203
01:37:02,841 --> 01:37:04,468
Guess not.

1204
01:37:06,052 --> 01:37:08,012
You...

1205
01:37:08,805 --> 01:37:11,473
You drove all this way
just to bring me my car?

1206
01:37:11,682 --> 01:37:12,975
Sort of.

1207
01:37:13,183 --> 01:37:16,353
Well, I mean, it gave me an excuse
to get the hell out of Grady.

1208
01:37:16,562 --> 01:37:19,063
Pardon my French.
Things were bad before...

1209
01:37:19,272 --> 01:37:22,607
but since you left,
they got positively stagnant.

1210
01:37:26,027 --> 01:37:29,280
- How's Hogue?
- Well, he's the same.

1211
01:37:31,949 --> 01:37:34,868
- Melvin?
- Same.

1212
01:37:35,660 --> 01:37:36,953
How's your dad?

1213
01:37:38,454 --> 01:37:40,956
Why don't you ask
me about Vialula?

1214
01:37:41,999 --> 01:37:46,127
What's there to ask, really?
I guess she and Hank are...

1215
01:37:46,335 --> 01:37:47,962
You're in my chair.

1216
01:37:49,922 --> 01:37:52,048
Slide a bit, Nancy Lee.

1217
01:37:54,843 --> 01:37:59,638
There's a man in the toilet selling
aftershave. Now, what's that all about?

1218
01:38:00,806 --> 01:38:02,265
Hank.

1219
01:38:04,142 --> 01:38:05,935
What are you doing here?

1220
01:38:06,102 --> 01:38:09,354
Took my own advice, doc.
Knowing when to stay, when to get out.

1221
01:38:10,314 --> 01:38:13,149
I thought you and
Lou were gonna get...

1222
01:38:13,357 --> 01:38:17,570
Lou was never gonna marry me.
So I broke it off, clean.

1223
01:38:19,112 --> 01:38:21,156
You dumped her?

1224
01:38:21,364 --> 01:38:23,574
A man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do...

1225
01:38:23,741 --> 01:38:27,786
even if it's in California.
Sense of higher purpose, you know?

1226
01:38:29,954 --> 01:38:31,831
Is that a star?

1227
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:34,708
No, that's Ted Danson.

1228
01:38:46,885 --> 01:38:49,429
I'm going for breakfast.
You want anything?

1229
01:38:49,638 --> 01:38:51,931
How about Bob Barker?

1230
01:38:52,139 --> 01:38:54,517
I'll see what I can do.

1231
01:39:03,524 --> 01:39:05,567
Howdy.

1232
01:39:10,029 --> 01:39:12,156
You steal that pig?

1233
01:39:13,074 --> 01:39:16,326
I heard she was wasting away
in this one-pig town, so...

1234
01:39:16,493 --> 01:39:18,745
And you thought you'd
come back and rescue her.

1235
01:39:19,286 --> 01:39:21,956
Yeah.
Something like that.

1236
01:39:22,706 --> 01:39:25,083
What makes you think
she'll take you back?

1237
01:39:27,252 --> 01:39:28,795
Because I love her.

1238
01:39:32,631 --> 01:39:35,175
Go back to Los Angeles.

1239
01:39:36,133 --> 01:39:38,803
I don't want Los Angeles.

1240
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:41,013
I want you.

1241
01:39:50,771 --> 01:39:53,231
You got great tonsils.

1242
01:39:56,776 --> 01:39:58,652
That ain't all.

1243
01:40:00,362 --> 01:40:03,532
I just thought of something.
I can collect that $ 10 from Nicholson.

1244
01:40:03,740 --> 01:40:05,616
- You lost that bet.
- I did not.

1245
01:40:05,783 --> 01:40:07,243
- Who says?
- Me.

1246
01:40:07,451 --> 01:40:12,330
- You have no say. You are the bet.
- The bet was for one week. You lost.

1247
01:40:12,497 --> 01:40:13,957
It's your word against mine.

1248
01:40:14,166 --> 01:40:17,501
You would sully my reputation
for 10 measly dollars?

1249
01:40:17,710 --> 01:40:21,758
Absolutely. I don't even
know what "sully" means.
