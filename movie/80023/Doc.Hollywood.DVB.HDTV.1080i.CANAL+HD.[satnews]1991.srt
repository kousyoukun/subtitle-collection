1
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,872
Keep your hands off me!

2
00:00:29,712 --> 00:00:32,000
- I'll be with you in a moment.
- Don't walk away.

3
00:00:32,172 --> 00:00:35,588
- Doctor, I can't feel my arm.
- Just a minute.

4
00:00:36,968 --> 00:00:39,755
- I can't feel my arm.
- I can't feel it right now either.

5
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:42,715
- Can someone feel his arm?
- I can't feel it.

6
00:00:45,934 --> 00:00:47,344
Don't touch my hair.

7
00:00:47,518 --> 00:00:49,392
Kiss the boo-boo. Kiss the boo-boo.

8
00:00:49,562 --> 00:00:52,681
- Hey, you're still here.
- Yeah, I'm still here. Can you believe it?

9
00:00:52,856 --> 00:00:56,688
Save me some coffee, you savage.

10
00:00:58,778 --> 00:01:00,687
<i>What is this,
Alfred Hitchcock Presents?</i>

11
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,070
- What's the problem?
- Gunshot wounds. Shoulder, abdomen.

12
00:01:08,244 --> 00:01:10,782
We've been paging you.
You on California time already?

13
00:01:10,955 --> 00:01:13,659
- I was in Radiology working on my tan.
- Pulse, 120.

14
00:01:13,832 --> 00:01:15,908
Get this guy typed and crossed, huh?

15
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:20,325
Okay, question: Beverly Hills,
beautiful women and plastic surgery...

16
00:01:20,504 --> 00:01:23,421
...what do these three things
have in common?

17
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,918
Me, in less than a week.

18
00:01:25,717 --> 00:01:29,168
Okay, don't worry about his shoulder.
He's probably bleeding internally.

19
00:01:29,345 --> 00:01:32,511
Call Dr. Sotto, tell him to prep for O.R.
I'm out of here tonight.

20
00:01:32,681 --> 00:01:36,215
Convince me I'll be nostalgic for here
when I'm at the Halberstrom Clinic.

21
00:01:36,393 --> 00:01:38,515
- Halberstrom?
- Cosmetic surgery for the rich.

22
00:01:38,686 --> 00:01:42,304
- I'm not in it for the money.
- Half a million salary when he's partner.

23
00:01:42,481 --> 00:01:46,810
That high-profit stuff makes it possible
for us to do reconstructive surgery...

24
00:01:46,985 --> 00:01:49,191
...on the needier patients.
- You're a saint.

25
00:01:49,362 --> 00:01:53,406
- Got another customer over there.
- I'll do it. My going-away present to you.

26
00:01:53,574 --> 00:01:56,942
- What's the problem?
- Too much fun. Substance unknown.

27
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:00,617
Okay, stay with us. Stay with us.
What'd you take, man?

28
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:02,661
Bluebirds, dillies, love boats?

29
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,951
I heard Halberstrom might not
even hire anyone this year.

30
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,370
Well, I'm not anyone.

31
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:11,708
Mulready, some of the guys are having
a going-away bash for me tonight.

32
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,834
- Lf you're interested, I'd love...
- Not in this lifetime.

33
00:02:18,678 --> 00:02:20,836
- Clean up.
- Thanks.

34
00:02:21,013 --> 00:02:24,049
Come on, what do you say, guys?
Dinner. Think about it.

35
00:02:24,224 --> 00:02:27,427
Come on, it's my last night.
A couple of lousy beers?

36
00:02:27,602 --> 00:02:29,890
- Take care, man.
- Guys...

37
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,597
I'll send you a postcard.

38
00:02:36,484 --> 00:02:38,192
What?

39
00:02:38,778 --> 00:02:41,613
At the risk of sounding schmaltzy,
I just wanna tell you...

40
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,401
...that you're a schmuck.
I hope I never see you again.

41
00:02:44,616 --> 00:02:47,866
Thanks, Tommy. I know how hard
it was for you to say that.

42
00:02:48,036 --> 00:02:52,496
You're a good doctor, Ben. I just thought
you were gonna practice real medicine.

43
00:02:53,999 --> 00:02:57,083
Think I'm making a mistake
going to Halberstrom?

44
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:01,704
No. Cosmetic surgery is clean...

45
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:05,331
...you make tons of money,
nobody dies.

46
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,419
What's wrong with that, right?

47
00:03:07,594 --> 00:03:09,171
Right.

48
00:03:09,512 --> 00:03:11,255
Bye, Ben.

49
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:48,964
Oh, come on.

50
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:14,777
Look out.

51
00:05:37,344 --> 00:05:40,712
All right, okay. Can I just ask you...

52
00:05:40,888 --> 00:05:42,715
...where am I now?

53
00:06:49,571 --> 00:06:55,323
Oh, man. Oh, God. Oh, God.
I'm okay. I'm okay.

54
00:06:55,868 --> 00:06:59,995
Accident. Woman in the middle
of the road with a cow!

55
00:07:00,705 --> 00:07:02,863
All right. I'm okay.

56
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,908
Damn, my car.
Oh, man, the whole front end is shot!

57
00:07:09,754 --> 00:07:11,082
Am I glad you're here.

58
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:16,132
Is that a '56 or a '57 Speedster?

59
00:07:16,593 --> 00:07:18,586
Fifty-six.

60
00:07:19,012 --> 00:07:22,096
Hey, come on, get out.
Will you get out of the car!

61
00:07:22,265 --> 00:07:23,593
Get away from there.

62
00:07:23,766 --> 00:07:26,435
- Took three weeks to build that fence.
- I'm sorry.

63
00:07:26,602 --> 00:07:29,223
Does this have a Super 90 engine
or a 1600?

64
00:07:29,396 --> 00:07:31,471
It wasn't really anybody's fault.

65
00:07:31,648 --> 00:07:34,019
My insurance will probably pay
for the fence...

66
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:35,934
...and that should be fine. Okay?

67
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,434
- Won't be the same.
- This ain't a kit car, is it?

68
00:07:38,612 --> 00:07:40,604
No, it ain't. It isn't.

69
00:07:41,197 --> 00:07:44,281
My name is Ben Stone.

70
00:07:44,492 --> 00:07:46,733
I'm a medical doctor.
I'm a surgeon.

71
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,618
Awesome. Who thrashed the fence?

72
00:07:48,787 --> 00:07:51,324
I'm Ben Stone. Here's the address
of my clinic in L.A.

73
00:07:51,497 --> 00:07:54,202
- Did he say he's been stoned?
- He says he's from L.A.

74
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,663
You can send a bill there
or we can use plastic.

75
00:07:56,835 --> 00:07:59,124
I'm not really from L.A.
I'm just on my way to...

76
00:07:59,296 --> 00:08:03,756
- You're lucky I was passing through.
- What's in the trunk? Pot?

77
00:08:05,134 --> 00:08:08,965
I'm a surgeon. Come on, will you
get away! Get away from the car!

78
00:08:09,137 --> 00:08:10,714
- Sorry.
- Not you, the dog.

79
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:12,548
The finest fence I'll ever put up.

80
00:08:12,723 --> 00:08:15,558
I know a Willie Stone in Stanton.
Is that family of yours?

81
00:08:15,726 --> 00:08:18,679
- I understand what you're trying to do.
- This the new Mazda?

82
00:08:18,854 --> 00:08:21,640
And I'm not putting up
with any small-town bullshit.

83
00:08:21,814 --> 00:08:24,056
Where's the dang engine?

84
00:08:24,233 --> 00:08:28,444
Get away from this car! You don't
even know where the engine is.

85
00:08:28,945 --> 00:08:30,819
Got you.

86
00:08:32,907 --> 00:08:35,611
Look, I'm sorry
about what happened...

87
00:08:35,784 --> 00:08:39,651
...but it was an accident, okay?
It was nobody's fault.

88
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:43,162
Get me to a phone. I'll call
a Porsche mechanic in the next big city.

89
00:08:43,332 --> 00:08:47,460
I'll get my car fixed, be on my way,
and you can go back to doing...

90
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:49,086
...whatever it is you do.

91
00:08:52,382 --> 00:08:55,168
All right, I admit it!
I flattened the damn fence!

92
00:08:55,342 --> 00:08:57,750
What are you gonna do, lock me up?

93
00:09:02,473 --> 00:09:06,885
Court finds the defendant guilty
of crimes under code 453-19...

94
00:09:07,061 --> 00:09:10,263
...reckless driving, and 466-2,
reckless endangerment.

95
00:09:10,438 --> 00:09:12,976
- This is insane.
- No, this is Grady.

96
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:16,767
Your Honor, there were cows
in the middle of the road.

97
00:09:16,944 --> 00:09:20,692
Now, I told you my insurance company
would pay for a new fence.

98
00:09:20,864 --> 00:09:22,986
I built that fence myself.

99
00:09:23,157 --> 00:09:26,691
Neither you nor your insurance can
pay me for a fence I built myself.

100
00:09:26,869 --> 00:09:29,324
Next best thing would be
a fence that you built.

101
00:09:29,496 --> 00:09:33,575
- These hands are delicate instruments.
- I doubt you could build a good fence.

102
00:09:33,749 --> 00:09:35,955
Therefore, since you're
a licensed physician...

103
00:09:36,126 --> 00:09:38,831
...and we are a town in acute shortage
of medical care...

104
00:09:39,004 --> 00:09:42,088
- You wouldn't.
...your sentence will be 16 hours...

105
00:09:42,257 --> 00:09:43,751
...of community service...

106
00:09:43,925 --> 00:09:46,878
...served as resident doctor
at Grady Memorial Hospital.

107
00:09:47,052 --> 00:09:50,006
I have to be in Los Angeles
by Tuesday, so I don't...

108
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,172
Thirty-two hours.

109
00:09:52,348 --> 00:09:55,384
- This is extortion!
- You want 64 hours?

110
00:09:56,727 --> 00:09:57,972
No.

111
00:09:58,895 --> 00:10:00,389
Court is adjourned.

112
00:10:00,564 --> 00:10:02,188
All rise.

113
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:05,389
- I am so fucked.
- Watch your language, doc.

114
00:10:05,568 --> 00:10:10,774
You're in the buckle of the Bible belt
here. Try saying "fudge" or something.

115
00:10:11,072 --> 00:10:13,563
- "Fiddlesticks" too strong?
- Depends.

116
00:10:13,741 --> 00:10:16,030
Don't you worry
about your automobile, doc.

117
00:10:16,202 --> 00:10:19,949
I always wanted an excuse
to buy me a set of metric tools.

118
00:10:20,122 --> 00:10:23,205
Sh... Sugar.

119
00:10:47,436 --> 00:10:48,978
Hey.

120
00:10:51,022 --> 00:10:52,564
I'm Dr. Benjamin Stone.

121
00:10:52,732 --> 00:10:56,515
Nurse Packer. I'm assuming
Judge Evans told you.

122
00:10:58,445 --> 00:11:00,319
Fine. Here's what I need.

123
00:11:00,489 --> 00:11:04,651
Comfortable bed, hot shower,
warm meal, locker to put my stuff in...

124
00:11:04,826 --> 00:11:07,577
Could you show me some kind
of identification, please?

125
00:11:15,793 --> 00:11:19,161
I'm wearing glasses there.
I wear contacts now.

126
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,121
My hair's a little shorter.

127
00:11:25,468 --> 00:11:29,168
That's a moustache.
It's a bad picture.

128
00:11:29,346 --> 00:11:32,928
If you could direct me to the physician
on call tonight, I'll speak to him.

129
00:11:35,977 --> 00:11:37,435
"When to call me:

130
00:11:37,603 --> 00:11:41,682
If you've been stabbed, shot, poisoned,
separated from an appendage...

131
00:11:41,856 --> 00:11:45,023
...knocked or beaten unconscious,
run over by a tractor, mower...

132
00:11:45,193 --> 00:11:48,526
...or generally about to bleed to death.
Otherwise, leave me alone."

133
00:11:48,695 --> 00:11:53,155
Signed,
Dr. Aurelius Edsel Hogue, M.D.

134
00:11:55,743 --> 00:11:58,031
<i>I'm in The Twilight Zone.</i>

135
00:12:00,372 --> 00:12:03,871
Zwieback and vitamin C
in the upper cabinet if you're hungry.

136
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:07,706
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
This is the best you can do?

137
00:12:07,962 --> 00:12:09,621
No.

138
00:12:25,434 --> 00:12:29,134
Oh, good, you're awake. Welcome
to Grady. I'm Mayor Nicholson.

139
00:12:29,313 --> 00:12:31,720
The second I heard
a big-city doctor was in town...

140
00:12:31,898 --> 00:12:34,815
...I left that rehearsal,
hightailed it over here...

141
00:12:34,984 --> 00:12:37,272
...see if I can make you
more comfortable.

142
00:12:37,445 --> 00:12:39,651
- We can do better than this.
- Better than this?

143
00:12:39,821 --> 00:12:41,814
Say, these your duffles?

144
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:46,570
I'm not claiming that Grady's no Paris,
France, but we got two gas stations...

145
00:12:46,744 --> 00:12:49,495
...got us a Winn-Dixie, got us cable TV.
Like tennis?

146
00:12:49,663 --> 00:12:53,411
We got a new tennis court at the high
school. You doctors play golf, though.

147
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:56,204
- Learning how to surf, actually.
- Isn't this pretty?

148
00:12:56,377 --> 00:12:59,876
We had this fixed up for a doctor
we got through the want ads years ago.

149
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:02,620
- No one's been in it for a while.
- Mayor Nicholson.

150
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:06,250
I'm on my way to California.
Don't be thinking I'm staying here.

151
00:13:06,427 --> 00:13:08,799
No, no, of course not.

152
00:13:08,971 --> 00:13:11,378
Well, maybe not.
Give old Grady a chance...

153
00:13:11,556 --> 00:13:14,094
...she might sneak up on you
like a bee in a bottle.

154
00:13:18,771 --> 00:13:20,099
Surprise!

155
00:13:20,272 --> 00:13:22,727
- Welcoming committee.
- I hope you're hungry.

156
00:13:23,858 --> 00:13:25,317
Evening, ladies.

157
00:13:25,485 --> 00:13:29,316
Ben Stone, this here is Miss Violet
and Miss Lillian and Miss Maddie.

158
00:13:29,488 --> 00:13:32,821
Ladies, this here is Ben Stone, M.D.

159
00:13:32,991 --> 00:13:36,940
Fried chicken, boiled peanuts
and sweet potato pie.

160
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:41,662
Catfish, biscuits, butter beans
and watermelon.

161
00:13:41,832 --> 00:13:44,951
Hungry-Man dinner. I'm a bad cook.

162
00:13:45,126 --> 00:13:49,289
Well, I guess I'll just say adieu
and come chauffeur you in the morning.

163
00:13:49,463 --> 00:13:51,455
No, wait, wait, wait. Come on.

164
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:53,173
You can't leave me here...

165
00:13:53,341 --> 00:13:56,092
...in the middle of nowhere with them.
It's getting late.

166
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:00,008
Don't worry. Only one of them horny.
I'm not telling you which one.

167
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,256
Your face.

168
00:14:08,979 --> 00:14:11,386
You want a cocktail?

169
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:16,602
So anyway, the high-profile,
high-profit work...

170
00:14:16,777 --> 00:14:19,813
...just makes it possible for me
to do the more important...

171
00:14:19,988 --> 00:14:23,688
...reconstructive surgery
for needier patients.

172
00:14:24,617 --> 00:14:26,989
And get a big house on the beach.

173
00:14:27,161 --> 00:14:31,739
It's hard to believe. A man as good-
looking as Dr. Stone should be married.

174
00:14:31,915 --> 00:14:34,038
Maybe he ain't found
his Adam's rib yet.

175
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:38,206
Maybe he indulges in the love
that dare not speak its name.

176
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:40,869
- Lillian.
- Will I go blind?

177
00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:45,423
- It's moonshine, right?
- Well, ouzo, actually.

178
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:48,962
- We took a cruise to Greece.
- Not me. I wasn't invited.

179
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,972
It was one of those
golden-agers tours.

180
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,133
Sunset Tours, honey.

181
00:14:54,309 --> 00:14:57,262
- They ate the brains out of a goat.
- Not me.

182
00:14:57,436 --> 00:14:59,761
- We ate dog.
- I didn't eat no dog.

183
00:14:59,938 --> 00:15:02,856
You don't know that you didn't.

184
00:15:03,191 --> 00:15:06,725
Dr. Stone, there's a legend
about friendship quilts.

185
00:15:06,903 --> 00:15:08,527
That's bunk.

186
00:15:08,696 --> 00:15:13,404
Folks say that the first person
to sleep under a friendship quilt...

187
00:15:13,575 --> 00:15:16,279
...will meet the one
they're gonna marry.

188
00:15:16,452 --> 00:15:19,572
Dream about the one they're
gonna marry, and it's bunk.

189
00:15:19,747 --> 00:15:22,949
What a fine hand he has.

190
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,707
Dr. Stone?

191
00:15:26,753 --> 00:15:28,496
Dr. Stone?

192
00:16:42,232 --> 00:16:44,438
Oh, God.

193
00:17:07,086 --> 00:17:08,746
Hello.

194
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:11,917
Hi.

195
00:17:12,758 --> 00:17:15,509
- Good morning.
- Is something wrong?

196
00:17:15,677 --> 00:17:17,965
No, no, no.

197
00:17:18,846 --> 00:17:20,554
I'm a doctor.

198
00:17:20,723 --> 00:17:23,213
Yeah, I know who you are.

199
00:17:25,185 --> 00:17:29,478
Hey, I'm sorry. Would you...?
Do you want this?

200
00:17:29,647 --> 00:17:33,644
If you're a doctor, I don't have
anything you haven't seen before.

201
00:17:44,201 --> 00:17:46,442
You can blink now.

202
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,538
All the boys from the state legislature
come here, do their recreating.

203
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:58,160
Boy, can they litter. Presidents
come here during the fishing season.

204
00:17:58,337 --> 00:18:00,330
On purpose?

205
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:03,964
One look at all this, Ben boy,
I'm sure you're saying to yourself:

206
00:18:04,134 --> 00:18:07,384
"I have come to Grady at the most
beautiful time of the year."

207
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:10,720
But, boy, these dogwoods, azaleas,
when they blooming...

208
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:14,721
...they can't hold a candle to the nuclear
explosion of color come fall.

209
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:18,972
Nick, you're the mayor. You have
the authority to commute my sentence.

210
00:18:19,146 --> 00:18:20,724
Could you do that?

211
00:18:20,898 --> 00:18:23,934
I'll make it worth your while.
I get back to L.A., we could...

212
00:18:24,109 --> 00:18:26,860
Why on earth
would I wanna do that?

213
00:18:27,028 --> 00:18:30,527
How am I gonna convince you
to stay here if you're not here?

214
00:18:31,282 --> 00:18:34,982
We need a doctor, you need patients.

215
00:18:35,202 --> 00:18:39,448
Get off the interstate, Ben Stone.

216
00:18:39,956 --> 00:18:41,533
Right?

217
00:18:44,584 --> 00:18:48,083
Don't let the signs of prosperity and
urban sprawl in downtown scare you.

218
00:18:48,254 --> 00:18:50,412
We're still the same
sleepy little paradise...

219
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:53,958
...that big-city shrinks recommend
for patients with nervous disorders.

220
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:56,541
It's the calming effect
of Grady's natural ozone.

221
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,424
Fact, there's a world-class
mental hospital up the road.

222
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:00,925
That's a comforting thought.

223
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:04,930
Ben Stone, do you like coffee?
If you like coffee, we won't go in here.

224
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,345
- Is that him?
- That's him.

225
00:19:08,521 --> 00:19:11,806
- He's young, huh?
- Come on, let's go.

226
00:19:14,526 --> 00:19:16,981
Boys, this here is Ben Stone...

227
00:19:17,153 --> 00:19:20,273
...a Hollywood physician
who's gonna spend a few days with us.

228
00:19:20,448 --> 00:19:24,694
Ben, this is Mortimer, John, Aubrey.
Probably don't want to shake his hand.

229
00:19:24,868 --> 00:19:27,868
Sorty in the corner.
Sorty got a cow that sings.

230
00:19:28,037 --> 00:19:31,620
- You remember Cotton, Miss Lillian.
- Hollywood. La-la land.

231
00:19:31,957 --> 00:19:33,617
- Beverly Hills, actually.
- Whatever.

232
00:19:33,792 --> 00:19:37,659
- Well, William's been a movie star.
- It was just an Army training film.

233
00:19:37,837 --> 00:19:40,506
Come now, you were the star.
You played the lead role.

234
00:19:40,673 --> 00:19:44,836
It was about VD. I was the bacteria.
Had a big scene with penicillin.

235
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,632
Yes, a death scene.

236
00:19:47,804 --> 00:19:50,508
Take a load off, doctor.
This will stop your worries.

237
00:19:50,681 --> 00:19:52,590
Or start them.

238
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,767
So, what do you think of our town?

239
00:19:55,936 --> 00:19:58,509
- I haven't seen all of it yet.
- Yeah, you have.

240
00:19:59,689 --> 00:20:01,064
Opportunity abounds here.

241
00:20:01,232 --> 00:20:03,557
Growth rate was up.3 percent
last year.

242
00:20:03,734 --> 00:20:06,687
- There's no crime.
- By the way, we are the county seat.

243
00:20:06,861 --> 00:20:10,811
Fellas, no point in beating a dead horse
to death. That's all in the brochure.

244
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:15,402
Ben Stone, we are prepared
to offer you a permanent position...

245
00:20:15,577 --> 00:20:19,076
...as medical practitioner supreme
in the Grady metropolitan area...

246
00:20:19,247 --> 00:20:21,488
...the squash capital of the South.

247
00:20:21,665 --> 00:20:24,832
The salary's $27,000 per annum,
and plus housing.

248
00:20:25,836 --> 00:20:27,460
Twenty-seven thousand?

249
00:20:27,629 --> 00:20:31,246
- You see, Nick, I told you...
- Hold on. Thirty thousand.

250
00:20:32,174 --> 00:20:34,925
Look, you people don't even know me.

251
00:20:35,093 --> 00:20:37,762
I noticed right off that he
double-knots his shoelaces.

252
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:40,550
- Excellent credentials.
- Shows he's careful.

253
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:43,096
Anyway, don't you already have
a doctor?

254
00:20:43,267 --> 00:20:45,176
We got Hogue.
The problem with Hogue is...

255
00:20:45,352 --> 00:20:47,843
- He's old.
- Old and wholly unpleasant.

256
00:20:48,021 --> 00:20:50,179
Point is, he's not going
to be around forever.

257
00:20:50,398 --> 00:20:51,726
Thirty-five thousand?

258
00:20:51,899 --> 00:20:54,983
But that would take a unanimous vote
of the whole city council.

259
00:20:55,152 --> 00:20:57,191
- All in favor say, "Aye."
- Aye.

260
00:20:57,362 --> 00:20:59,734
- I abstain.
- You always abstain.

261
00:20:59,906 --> 00:21:03,903
Look, I appreciate your problem...

262
00:21:04,076 --> 00:21:06,115
...but I'm not the answer.

263
00:21:06,286 --> 00:21:08,658
I got a big job interview
on the West Coast.

264
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:12,494
It's very important I get there in the
next couple of days. Plastic surgery.

265
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:16,877
The truth is, they can probably pay me
about 20 times what you can afford.

266
00:21:17,045 --> 00:21:19,962
There's a lot of similarities
between Grady and Los Angeles.

267
00:21:20,131 --> 00:21:21,755
They're just bigger, is all.

268
00:21:22,633 --> 00:21:24,376
- What do I owe you?
- Ten bucks.

269
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:27,220
- Ten bucks for coffee and toast?
- Got you.

270
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:30,138
Tell you what, why don't you wait
to make up your mind...

271
00:21:30,306 --> 00:21:32,215
...till after the squash festival, huh?

272
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:36,803
All I'm saying, Ben Stone, is give Grady
a chance. I bet you'll like her.

273
00:21:38,396 --> 00:21:42,524
Yeah, well, nice meeting you all.

274
00:21:42,691 --> 00:21:44,435
Thanks.

275
00:21:53,826 --> 00:21:57,028
- Howdy, nurse. How you doing?
- Doctor's lounge is down the hall.

276
00:21:57,204 --> 00:22:02,197
You can change in there, then Lou will
show you around. This is your time card.

277
00:22:03,834 --> 00:22:06,407
You gotta be kidding.

278
00:22:14,009 --> 00:22:17,627
- Local call?
- I don't know anybody local.

279
00:22:17,846 --> 00:22:20,633
Pay phone's in the waiting room.

280
00:22:23,058 --> 00:22:28,597
Yeah, it's... No, it's a collect call
from Dr. Benjamin Stone.

281
00:22:28,772 --> 00:22:30,479
Stone.

282
00:22:30,648 --> 00:22:32,356
Come on, do you mind?
This is a...

283
00:22:33,526 --> 00:22:36,941
...personal call.
- I guess so.

284
00:22:39,322 --> 00:22:44,030
Yeah, hi. Yes, this is Dr. Stone.
Actually, that's why I'm calling.

285
00:22:44,201 --> 00:22:46,870
I don't think I'm gonna be able
to make it on Tuesday.

286
00:22:47,037 --> 00:22:49,658
I just... There was a...

287
00:22:51,207 --> 00:22:53,579
A medical emergency in...

288
00:22:53,751 --> 00:22:56,751
They don't have a doctor,
so I volunteered my services.

289
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,170
I'll need to stay
until the situation stabilizes.

290
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,999
Yeah, medically speaking.

291
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:05,380
You're interviewing other doctors?
Friday?

292
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:10,213
Yeah, okay, Friday. I can do that. No,
thank you very much. And thank Doctor...

293
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:15,555
<i>That was better tap-dancing
than I've seen on Star Search.</i>

294
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:21,305
If you tell me you're here for
a physical, you're gonna make my day.

295
00:23:21,482 --> 00:23:24,234
It's unprofessional to flirt
with the patients.

296
00:23:24,401 --> 00:23:28,564
I'm just on my way to Beverly Hills.
Plastic surgery.

297
00:23:28,738 --> 00:23:30,565
Not that you need any.

298
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,613
Nice try.

299
00:23:32,783 --> 00:23:36,483
<i>So is this the GQ look
for young urban doctors?</i>

300
00:23:37,537 --> 00:23:41,036
Well, I've spent the last two years
doing 18-hour days in the ER.

301
00:23:41,207 --> 00:23:44,622
I find these are pretty comfortable.

302
00:23:45,044 --> 00:23:46,953
You don't like them?

303
00:23:47,212 --> 00:23:48,836
No.

304
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:54,381
Okay, fine. Well, I really enjoyed
our time together here...

305
00:23:54,552 --> 00:23:58,596
...but since you're obviously not a
patient, and I'm not getting anywhere...

306
00:23:58,763 --> 00:24:02,511
...tell me where I can find a guy named
Lou, drives an ambulance?

307
00:24:02,683 --> 00:24:04,426
I'm Lou.

308
00:24:13,901 --> 00:24:15,774
Where did all these people come from?

309
00:24:15,944 --> 00:24:19,194
Folks hear there's a doctor on duty,
they come running.

310
00:24:19,364 --> 00:24:21,855
Any old doctor.

311
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,569
Send them in.

312
00:24:27,246 --> 00:24:30,412
Okay, Mr. Tidwell.

313
00:24:30,582 --> 00:24:33,119
What the hell have you got
on your foot?

314
00:24:33,292 --> 00:24:34,870
That's a poultice.

315
00:24:35,044 --> 00:24:38,957
- Nurse Packer!
- I got ahold to Doc Hogue on the CB...

316
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:41,703
...and he said that that will hold me
till I came in.

317
00:24:41,883 --> 00:24:43,341
- You did this on purpose?
- Yes.

318
00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:46,712
It's chimney soot, biscuit flour
and lard. Doc Hogue said...

319
00:24:46,887 --> 00:24:52,225
Wipe that crap off Mr. Tidwell's foot,
please, and clean that wound out.

320
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:57,809
- You allergic to penicillin?
- Don't know. Ask Doc Hogue.

321
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:01,146
Doubt Doc Hogue knows
it's even been discovered.

322
00:25:01,774 --> 00:25:05,937
Okay. Nurse Packer,
I'm gonna wash this with Betadine...

323
00:25:06,111 --> 00:25:10,322
...close it with a butterfly,
give it a sterile dressing.

324
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:13,325
You sure you ought to be doing that
so darned fast?

325
00:25:13,492 --> 00:25:15,615
I hope so, Mr. Tidwell...

326
00:25:15,786 --> 00:25:17,825
<i>...because je suis fini.</i>

327
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:26,035
Okay, Mrs. Owens, if you could
please get up on the table...

328
00:25:26,211 --> 00:25:27,789
...put your feet in the stirrups.

329
00:25:35,386 --> 00:25:37,425
We're just here about our mail.

330
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:41,713
It's from my sister. We don't read.

331
00:25:44,477 --> 00:25:48,640
- This ever happen before, Mr. McClary?
- Hell, yes. It happens.

332
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:51,221
This ain't nearly the biggest one
I ever took.

333
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:55,527
I had a hook in my thigh once.
It must have been, I'd say, like...

334
00:25:55,694 --> 00:25:57,936
Oh, excuse me, l... Yeah, well...

335
00:25:58,113 --> 00:26:01,612
- Fishing's a dangerous business.
- Well, it can be.

336
00:26:01,783 --> 00:26:07,950
"And after the cow died, there just
wasn't any reason for him to go on.

337
00:26:08,538 --> 00:26:12,405
Meanwhile, Ellen's got herself
mixed up with a Pakistani gentleman...

338
00:26:12,583 --> 00:26:15,999
...who nobody can understand
what he is saying.

339
00:26:16,587 --> 00:26:18,626
Not even Ellen."

340
00:26:18,922 --> 00:26:21,460
I don't see any toxic striations.

341
00:26:21,633 --> 00:26:23,127
Red streaks.

342
00:26:23,301 --> 00:26:25,922
You sure it was a black widow?

343
00:26:26,095 --> 00:26:30,423
Here. I kept it in some T.P.

344
00:26:32,058 --> 00:26:34,346
Oh, dear Lord, it's escaped.

345
00:26:36,604 --> 00:26:38,560
- There it is.
- Wait, there he goes.

346
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:41,600
- Here he goes. Here he goes.
- Step on it.

347
00:26:41,775 --> 00:26:44,645
"She thinks Ray's having an affair
with the pastor's wife...

348
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:48,187
...but Ray swears
it's his scrub-up rash."

349
00:26:48,864 --> 00:26:51,983
Ray is a nut, I'm telling you.

350
00:26:52,242 --> 00:26:55,692
It's like a blurred spot
in my vision.

351
00:26:55,870 --> 00:27:00,910
Out there. No. There. No.
No, there.

352
00:27:12,467 --> 00:27:14,589
I'm cured.

353
00:27:15,052 --> 00:27:19,299
"The pastor's wife got busted
for growing marijuana...

354
00:27:19,473 --> 00:27:21,382
...out behind the rectory.

355
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:26,931
So she'll be spending a spell up in Tupelo
at the minimum-security prison."

356
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,770
That's it?

357
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:35,777
What about Ellen and the Pakistani?

358
00:27:45,911 --> 00:27:48,069
Nurse Packer? Nurse Packer.

359
00:27:48,247 --> 00:27:52,160
Where's Doc Hogue? The boy can't
breathe right, and he's turning blue.

360
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:53,662
I'm the doctor here.

361
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:56,790
Nurse Packer,
you've got to call Doc Hogue.

362
00:27:57,379 --> 00:28:00,664
- Please.
- It's all right. I'm the doctor.

363
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,171
- How long has he been like this?
- All afternoon.

364
00:28:04,343 --> 00:28:05,921
- What's his name?
- Zeb.

365
00:28:06,095 --> 00:28:08,846
Hey, Zeb, this is going to be
a little cold, all right?

366
00:28:09,014 --> 00:28:11,302
I just wanna hear your heart.

367
00:28:12,475 --> 00:28:14,432
Does your tummy hurt?

368
00:28:15,102 --> 00:28:18,802
All right, take him down to the
examination room. I'll be right there.

369
00:28:18,981 --> 00:28:21,732
You know where that is?
Right there, okay?

370
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,569
Have Zeb get up on the table for me.

371
00:28:26,612 --> 00:28:29,447
- Call Hogue. Get him here.
- He doesn't like to be disturbed.

372
00:28:29,615 --> 00:28:32,650
I really don't care. Forget Hogue.
What's the referral hospital?

373
00:28:32,826 --> 00:28:34,818
- Athens General.
- Call Athens General.

374
00:28:34,994 --> 00:28:38,279
We have a cardiac emergency.
Tell Lou to fire up the ambulance.

375
00:28:38,455 --> 00:28:41,372
No, forget it. They have a helicopter.
Tell them to send it.

376
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:45,408
- Get me Zeb's medical history.
- I better call Dr. Hogue.

377
00:28:45,586 --> 00:28:49,204
Damn it. Listen to me,
Hogue is not here. I'm here.

378
00:28:49,381 --> 00:28:51,255
You do it.

379
00:28:58,347 --> 00:29:00,007
Here's the situation.

380
00:29:00,182 --> 00:29:03,467
Your son is turning blue
because he has an abnormal mitral valve.

381
00:29:03,643 --> 00:29:07,058
It's causing a back flow of blood in
his heart. We may have to operate.

382
00:29:07,229 --> 00:29:08,854
We'll send him to Athens General.

383
00:29:09,022 --> 00:29:11,727
Dr. Hogue said
you should give the boy a Coke.

384
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:16,608
He says he's probably got a bellyache
and that you should give him a Coke.

385
00:29:19,656 --> 00:29:22,408
Listen, doctor, I've got a boy here
in cardiac crisis.

386
00:29:22,575 --> 00:29:26,619
You can't treat that with Coca-Cola or
Bisquick. We have to use real medicine.

387
00:29:26,787 --> 00:29:29,622
I'm sending him to Athens General.
You're his doctor...

388
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:32,790
...so get your fat ass out of bed
and go with him!

389
00:29:34,794 --> 00:29:38,743
- How long will the chopper be?
- Should be here any minute.

390
00:29:51,933 --> 00:29:54,602
- Where's Stone?
- Dr. Hogue.

391
00:29:55,353 --> 00:29:59,017
What the hell kind of snot-nosed
puppy doctor are you anyway?

392
00:29:59,189 --> 00:30:02,439
Wake me up, scare these folks out
of their skivvies.

393
00:30:02,609 --> 00:30:04,850
Mitral valve regurge.

394
00:30:05,028 --> 00:30:09,190
I've had a lot of experience with it in ER.
I've even assisted in surgery to correct.

395
00:30:09,365 --> 00:30:13,278
God only knows how long he's had this,
but you overlooked it. Check his color.

396
00:30:13,451 --> 00:30:15,609
Nurse Packer,
get that crap off the boy.

397
00:30:16,037 --> 00:30:19,073
Gene, you gave him the
bismuth subnitrate, didn't you?

398
00:30:19,248 --> 00:30:22,082
- At first we thought...
- You gave him too much as usual.

399
00:30:23,126 --> 00:30:25,414
Turned him three shades of blue.

400
00:30:25,586 --> 00:30:28,871
- Bismuth subnitrate?
- Homegrown antacid.

401
00:30:29,048 --> 00:30:31,372
You hear a heart murmur?

402
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,209
No, it's hard to detect.

403
00:30:33,385 --> 00:30:36,385
You been sampling
your daddy's chaw?

404
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,219
That will be 65 cents.

405
00:30:49,398 --> 00:30:52,102
Well, nice work, Hollywood.

406
00:30:52,275 --> 00:30:55,027
You were about to open
the chest of a 6-year-old boy...

407
00:30:55,194 --> 00:30:59,274
...to cure a case of diarrhea.
Now, listen up, smart-ass.

408
00:30:59,448 --> 00:31:01,986
Next time I tell you
how to treat a patient of mine...

409
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,029
...you better damn well do it, doctor.

410
00:31:05,203 --> 00:31:08,488
I doubt you'd know crap from Crisco.

411
00:31:18,923 --> 00:31:20,547
Hey.

412
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:25,629
Yeah, right.

413
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,676
Shit!

414
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:38,557
Wait. Wait. Hold your horses, doc.

415
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:42,479
Now, what if I walked in in the middle
of a hernia operation...

416
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:45,735
...see some poor gentleman's guts
all over?

417
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,400
- You killed my car.
- I resent that.

418
00:31:48,572 --> 00:31:51,608
That car was my life, Melvin.
That car was my baby.

419
00:31:51,783 --> 00:31:54,700
You want me to stop now?
I can put it in some boxes...

420
00:31:54,869 --> 00:31:58,072
...ship it out to Hollywood for you.
No skin off my nose.

421
00:31:58,247 --> 00:32:00,204
You and me called it
an oil pump casing.

422
00:32:00,374 --> 00:32:03,291
Lane had two years of the German
language in high school.

423
00:32:06,754 --> 00:32:08,912
Doc, let's step into my office.

424
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,717
I don't need a car.
I'm moving to Los Angeles.

425
00:32:14,886 --> 00:32:17,840
- What do I need a car for?
- Lash yourself to the mast.

426
00:32:18,014 --> 00:32:21,464
Fella up in Oregon has an oil pump
he could air-express to us tomorrow.

427
00:32:21,642 --> 00:32:25,769
Two hundred thirty-nine bucks,
plus shipping. Only one problem.

428
00:32:25,979 --> 00:32:28,350
Oregon exploded.

429
00:32:28,522 --> 00:32:30,016
No.

430
00:32:30,566 --> 00:32:33,899
He don't take credit. Or checks.

431
00:32:34,069 --> 00:32:38,113
And tomorrow being Saturday,
you can't just wire some cash to him.

432
00:32:38,281 --> 00:32:41,198
Okay, Melvin, let me ask you this.

433
00:32:41,366 --> 00:32:44,865
How do you propose I pay for this?

434
00:32:45,036 --> 00:32:46,578
Well, I was hoping you'd pay me.

435
00:32:46,746 --> 00:32:50,957
Then I can trade him for a front rocker
assembly I got from a '68 Nova, but...

436
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:54,956
- You don't take credit or checks.
- No, sir. I apologize.

437
00:32:55,128 --> 00:32:56,954
How long will this guy
in Oregon wait?

438
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:00,083
I imagine I could stall him
till Sunday noon.

439
00:33:00,257 --> 00:33:04,835
Now, he got another taker in Arizona,
but I was first.

440
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:09,173
Stall him.

441
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,303
- Hi, doc.
- Hi, doc.

442
00:33:15,478 --> 00:33:19,012
- Morning, doc.
- Morning, Ben Stone.

443
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:21,182
Howdy, y'all.

444
00:33:26,779 --> 00:33:30,479
- Dr. Stone. Dr. Stone, I presume.
- Yeah, that's right.

445
00:33:30,658 --> 00:33:32,116
- Hi.
- Hi.

446
00:33:32,284 --> 00:33:34,609
Say, you're much taller
than they said you were.

447
00:33:35,662 --> 00:33:38,331
I'm sitting on a stool.

448
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,951
And you are?

449
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:44,291
Dying to get out of this town.
How about you?

450
00:33:44,461 --> 00:33:46,667
- Here's your breakfast.
- I haven't ordered yet.

451
00:33:46,838 --> 00:33:50,040
Compliments of the house.
Don't let old Hogue scare you off.

452
00:33:50,216 --> 00:33:53,631
We know you weren't aiming
to kill that boy last night.

453
00:33:54,344 --> 00:33:57,048
Wait a minute, you're not planning
on staying in Grady?

454
00:33:57,221 --> 00:33:59,973
- Only as long as I have to.
- Thank God.

455
00:34:00,141 --> 00:34:02,892
For a second, I thought they got
their hooks into you too.

456
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:06,558
- Wait, you don't like Grady?
- No.

457
00:34:06,896 --> 00:34:08,474
So how come you don't leave?

458
00:34:09,357 --> 00:34:10,732
With you?

459
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:14,316
Is that a proposition, doctor?

460
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:18,144
I better eat this before it's cold.
Nice meeting you.

461
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:20,279
Thanks, Lillian.

462
00:34:26,704 --> 00:34:31,164
"Prosser on Torts." "Civil Procedure."
A little light reading this morning?

463
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:32,827
Did I invite you to sit down?

464
00:34:33,001 --> 00:34:36,168
No, but you were going to.
Southern hospitality and all.

465
00:34:37,171 --> 00:34:39,662
- Now what?
- Now let's talk about you.

466
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,757
Okay. I like my privacy.
I'm a vegetarian.

467
00:34:42,926 --> 00:34:46,425
I'd appreciate it if you'd take that slab
of ham to the counter with you.

468
00:34:46,596 --> 00:34:49,799
- It gives me the willies.
- I didn't order this slab.

469
00:34:49,974 --> 00:34:54,053
Now I suppose you'll say something cute
to stall your retreat.

470
00:34:54,227 --> 00:34:55,935
Maybe tell me about the big city...

471
00:34:56,104 --> 00:34:58,855
...all the things I'm missing
living in this dinky town...

472
00:34:59,023 --> 00:35:02,226
...and how you'd like to be the one
to take me out of it.

473
00:35:04,528 --> 00:35:07,149
Isn't that why you're going
to law school?

474
00:35:07,322 --> 00:35:09,693
You want to get out
of this dinky little town.

475
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:14,403
I'm not going yet. And I plan to practice
in Grady when I'm through.

476
00:35:15,287 --> 00:35:17,956
Yeah, it looks like a hotbed
of legal activity.

477
00:35:18,122 --> 00:35:21,954
Well, malpractice for visiting young
surgeons seems promising.

478
00:35:22,376 --> 00:35:24,036
Who's the green apple, Vialula?

479
00:35:24,795 --> 00:35:27,250
- Henry, this is Ben Stone.
- Hey.

480
00:35:27,422 --> 00:35:29,829
Oh, yeah, the new croaker.

481
00:35:30,007 --> 00:35:31,501
Hank Gordon.

482
00:35:31,675 --> 00:35:33,004
You're in my chair.

483
00:35:34,803 --> 00:35:36,842
- Boyfriend?
- "Friend" friend.

484
00:35:47,147 --> 00:35:49,851
- Need any life insurance?
- What?

485
00:35:50,024 --> 00:35:53,274
You should be vested
in a term life program.

486
00:35:53,444 --> 00:35:55,815
Probably a quarter of a mil to start.

487
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,685
Come by my office.
We could run a "what if."

488
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,863
Or are you too chicken?

489
00:36:04,077 --> 00:36:07,031
I read somewhere doctors have
the highest suicide rate...

490
00:36:07,205 --> 00:36:09,197
...in any profession except dentistry.

491
00:36:09,373 --> 00:36:13,073
- Is that true?
- I won't underwrite dentists. Nope.

492
00:36:13,252 --> 00:36:16,371
Never trust a man who'll put his hand
in your mouth.

493
00:36:16,713 --> 00:36:19,998
Well, I'd love to stay and hear
where this conversation's headed...

494
00:36:20,174 --> 00:36:22,463
...but if you all will excuse me.

495
00:36:23,635 --> 00:36:26,838
There's something else
I wanted to ask you.

496
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:32,175
Do doctors know more about sex
than normal people?

497
00:36:35,103 --> 00:36:37,772
I need some ketchup.

498
00:36:38,398 --> 00:36:40,935
I have a fair knowledge
of animal husbandry.

499
00:36:41,108 --> 00:36:43,350
It's all pretty much the same thing.

500
00:36:43,694 --> 00:36:45,104
- Bye, doc.
- Bye.

501
00:36:45,278 --> 00:36:47,851
Women trouble, Ben Stone?

502
00:36:48,531 --> 00:36:50,405
Squat here.

503
00:36:53,285 --> 00:36:56,488
- Regard the Grady squash.
- Looks like a yellow zucchini.

504
00:36:56,663 --> 00:37:01,538
Nope. See, up until 1933, you had your
Grady, you had your zucchini.

505
00:37:01,709 --> 00:37:03,535
They're going at it, gourd to gourd.

506
00:37:03,711 --> 00:37:07,245
Freak tornado accident wiped out
a whole shipment of Gradys...

507
00:37:07,422 --> 00:37:12,546
...bound for, I believe, agricultural
stardom at the Chicago World's Fair.

508
00:37:12,718 --> 00:37:14,924
The zucchini took there.
Never relented.

509
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:19,217
If it had gone the other way, no telling
where this town would be today.

510
00:37:20,016 --> 00:37:21,723
What are you talking about?

511
00:37:22,434 --> 00:37:25,352
Timing. Same thing with women.

512
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,556
And with Southern women,
they require substantial commitment.

513
00:37:28,731 --> 00:37:31,400
You might have to stay here
for six months, maybe more.

514
00:37:31,567 --> 00:37:35,267
- Are you a betting man, Nick?
- I have been known on occasion.

515
00:37:36,279 --> 00:37:38,355
- Take me about a week.
- Now, wait a minute.

516
00:37:38,531 --> 00:37:43,109
- You mean Vialula in the center pocket?
- Ten bucks.

517
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:47,742
Okay, you got it.

518
00:37:48,915 --> 00:37:51,370
Feels like I'm fleecing you, Ben Stone.

519
00:37:54,253 --> 00:37:56,079
Easy.

520
00:37:59,007 --> 00:38:01,248
Hello, Nurse Packer.

521
00:38:04,011 --> 00:38:05,588
All right.

522
00:38:05,762 --> 00:38:08,383
Okay, let's get something straight
right now.

523
00:38:08,556 --> 00:38:13,348
I got eight years of higher education, one
year of internship, one year of residency.

524
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:15,013
I'm $ 70,000 in debt.

525
00:38:15,187 --> 00:38:17,677
Now I'm waylaid in this heehaw hell...

526
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:21,390
...and you insist on clocking me in
and out like I'm a factory worker.

527
00:38:21,567 --> 00:38:25,399
Well, no! N-O, no!
This is where I draw the line.

528
00:38:26,655 --> 00:38:29,739
I believe you have a visitor, doctor.

529
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:37,821
Doc, my foot feels so good,
I brought you this pig.

530
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,993
Okay.

531
00:38:43,169 --> 00:38:46,169
I can't abide being in no man's debt.

532
00:38:46,338 --> 00:38:48,710
This pig's all I got to give.

533
00:38:50,675 --> 00:38:53,545
I'm already paid, more or less,
by the hospital.

534
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:57,586
- I really can't accept your pig.
- It's a done deal.

535
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,846
She's your pig now.

536
00:39:02,018 --> 00:39:04,224
God bless you both.

537
00:39:10,191 --> 00:39:13,108
Keep your animal outside.
This is a hospital.

538
00:39:26,913 --> 00:39:29,238
- Nice pig there, doc.
- Thank you.

539
00:39:29,416 --> 00:39:32,250
- Lovely pig.
- Thank you very much. Appreciate it.

540
00:39:32,418 --> 00:39:35,786
- Nice pig, doc!
- Thank you.

541
00:39:35,963 --> 00:39:38,916
Thank you all very much.

542
00:39:45,179 --> 00:39:50,848
Ben Stone. Say, I think I just took away
your last reason to go to California.

543
00:39:51,017 --> 00:39:53,887
Norrisville Drum and Bugle Corps.

544
00:39:54,061 --> 00:39:56,267
They played last four years
in the Rose Parade.

545
00:39:56,438 --> 00:39:59,937
I got them under exclusive contract
to the Grady Squash Festival.

546
00:40:00,108 --> 00:40:01,566
I'm not staying.

547
00:40:01,984 --> 00:40:03,443
Sure, you aren't.

548
00:40:03,611 --> 00:40:06,730
Oh, by the way, dinner at my house
tomorrow night, 6:00.

549
00:40:06,947 --> 00:40:08,489
- Dinner?
- Didn't I tell you?

550
00:40:08,657 --> 00:40:09,985
You're guest of honor.

551
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:14,484
Shoot a monkey. If my head wasn't
attached, I'd need wood screws.

552
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,239
- Nice pig, doc.
- Thanks.

553
00:40:16,413 --> 00:40:18,619
Can I bring a date?

554
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:21,459
Well, I don't know. Can you?

555
00:40:23,669 --> 00:40:27,536
This is Ben Stone you're talking to.
Come on, pig.

556
00:40:29,049 --> 00:40:31,337
Fine pig, doc.

557
00:40:36,221 --> 00:40:37,384
Melvin.

558
00:40:38,014 --> 00:40:41,299
Melvin. Melvin.

559
00:40:41,517 --> 00:40:45,052
Hey, doc. We're just rehearsing
for the pageant.

560
00:40:45,229 --> 00:40:48,597
We doing a pollination rap song.

561
00:40:51,734 --> 00:40:53,062
Melvin, listen.

562
00:40:53,236 --> 00:40:57,695
I don't have the money
for the oil-gepumpkin-hausen thing.

563
00:40:59,908 --> 00:41:03,905
I mean, when I say I haven't got
the money, that's not entirely true.

564
00:41:04,078 --> 00:41:05,987
I have the money.
I'm good for the money.

565
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:09,199
It's just a matter of accessing
the money in a period of time.

566
00:41:09,374 --> 00:41:12,125
Can we work something out, please?

567
00:41:12,293 --> 00:41:15,329
This car has got to be ready
by the time I leave.

568
00:41:18,715 --> 00:41:21,881
- That your pig?
- Yeah.

569
00:41:29,849 --> 00:41:33,929
You want to trade? Pig for the part?

570
00:41:34,728 --> 00:41:36,887
If you can part with the pig.

571
00:41:39,983 --> 00:41:41,014
Good.

572
00:41:46,321 --> 00:41:48,859
- Hi.
- Hi.

573
00:41:53,995 --> 00:41:57,280
- You just pick those?
- Yes, ma'am.

574
00:41:58,123 --> 00:42:01,538
They're protected by law.
State flowers.

575
00:42:04,128 --> 00:42:05,871
Figures.

576
00:42:06,297 --> 00:42:10,590
I'm already serving time for the fence.
May as well take my chances, right?

577
00:42:10,759 --> 00:42:15,171
Mama. Mama, who is it?
Who are you?

578
00:42:18,598 --> 00:42:20,390
I'm Ben.

579
00:42:21,684 --> 00:42:24,222
Emma, take these inside
and put them in some water.

580
00:42:24,395 --> 00:42:26,886
You're not supposed to pick these.

581
00:42:27,231 --> 00:42:29,140
Use the plastic pitcher.

582
00:42:31,818 --> 00:42:33,810
Yeah, she's mine.

583
00:42:33,986 --> 00:42:36,773
She's 4. You wanna retreat now or...?

584
00:42:36,947 --> 00:42:38,571
No, no, no.

585
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:41,527
No. Actually, I just came by...

586
00:42:41,701 --> 00:42:45,200
...because I need a date for dinner
tomorrow night.

587
00:42:45,371 --> 00:42:48,371
- Nick Nicholson's?
- Yeah. How'd you know?

588
00:42:48,707 --> 00:42:52,158
Can't poop in this town without
everyone knowing what color it is.

589
00:42:59,091 --> 00:43:02,506
I was fixing to have a cocktail.

590
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:04,545
Are you in a hurry?

591
00:43:07,139 --> 00:43:09,215
Oh, man, that's tart.

592
00:43:09,391 --> 00:43:13,518
It's called a " Slow Comfortable Screw
Up Against a Wall," with a twist.

593
00:43:13,686 --> 00:43:16,722
- Is that a Grady specialty?
- No.

594
00:43:16,897 --> 00:43:19,352
- New York City.
- New York?

595
00:43:19,524 --> 00:43:22,809
Yeah. I worked at one of those
weirdo theme bars on the West Side.

596
00:43:22,986 --> 00:43:25,690
Wayne and I went to college
in New York.

597
00:43:26,405 --> 00:43:28,196
Then he dropped out.

598
00:43:28,365 --> 00:43:32,362
I got pregnant.
He couldn't get work, so I bartended.

599
00:43:32,535 --> 00:43:34,990
I managed to finish school, though.

600
00:43:35,162 --> 00:43:37,735
- Wayne isn't still...?
- Wayne...

601
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:41,034
...is a professional dancer.

602
00:43:41,209 --> 00:43:43,248
One of those
exotic Chippendale things.

603
00:43:43,419 --> 00:43:46,870
He's in Boston, Miami...
I can't keep track.

604
00:43:47,298 --> 00:43:49,622
He left me after Emma was born.

605
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,835
I divorced him
and came running back here.

606
00:43:53,261 --> 00:43:58,467
Wayne has this extremely high opinion
of his legs.

607
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,345
You know, I just can't picture you
in the big city.

608
00:44:01,518 --> 00:44:03,344
New York.

609
00:44:03,686 --> 00:44:05,228
It's like me...

610
00:44:05,396 --> 00:44:07,803
- In Grady?
- Yeah.

611
00:44:08,857 --> 00:44:11,478
Well, peel an onion,
there's lots of layers.

612
00:44:13,528 --> 00:44:15,070
What layer is Hank on?

613
00:44:16,363 --> 00:44:19,364
Henry Gordon's sweet on me.

614
00:44:19,908 --> 00:44:21,817
And he's pretty decent and solid...

615
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:25,492
...once you get past the " Insurance
Rebel Without a Clause" routine.

616
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:28,369
Decent and solid.

617
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,244
Very romantic.

618
00:44:33,169 --> 00:44:38,210
I can see you coming from half a mile
away, Dr. Stone.

619
00:44:38,382 --> 00:44:40,623
You and your slick city ways.

620
00:44:40,801 --> 00:44:42,592
I suspect your version of romance...

621
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,796
...is whatever will separate me
from my panties.

622
00:44:47,389 --> 00:44:50,972
Look, all I'm talking about is dinner.

623
00:44:51,142 --> 00:44:53,894
In public. Wear a dress.

624
00:44:54,062 --> 00:44:56,303
Panties are optional.

625
00:44:57,731 --> 00:45:01,775
Well, I never have had dinner
at the mayor's house.

626
00:45:01,943 --> 00:45:04,066
Oh, boy.

627
00:45:04,695 --> 00:45:07,981
And after all,
how could I possibly refuse the man...

628
00:45:08,157 --> 00:45:10,398
...who saved Jasmine
from the butcher?

629
00:45:11,868 --> 00:45:15,319
- What are you talking about?
- Tidwell's pig.

630
00:45:15,496 --> 00:45:17,702
He was about to sell her
for pork chops...

631
00:45:17,873 --> 00:45:20,874
...if you hadn't fixed his foot,
made him feel guilty.

632
00:45:21,042 --> 00:45:24,541
Emma loves pigs.
You keeping her over at your house?

633
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:33,253
Lane, where's Melvin?

634
00:45:33,595 --> 00:45:37,010
Where's Melvin? I want my pig back.

635
00:45:39,349 --> 00:45:42,220
Did you say he went to church?
At this hour?

636
00:45:44,729 --> 00:45:49,224
Are you allowed to come out here?
I can't understand what you're saying.

637
00:45:49,399 --> 00:45:52,898
Melvin's gone to church.
He's gone to Tylerville.

638
00:45:53,069 --> 00:45:55,560
The pig got took to the butcher.

639
00:45:56,364 --> 00:45:58,652
Melvin took my pig to the butcher.

640
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:01,074
What?

641
00:46:09,291 --> 00:46:11,746
Mr. Crawford, where's my pig?

642
00:46:11,918 --> 00:46:14,623
You know, Jasmine, my pig.
Is she still alive?

643
00:46:14,796 --> 00:46:17,369
- Yes. She's in back.
- Thank God. Thank God.

644
00:46:17,548 --> 00:46:19,873
- I want her back.
- Doc...

645
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:22,671
I know what you're going to say.
Do you take plastic?

646
00:46:22,844 --> 00:46:25,548
Not unless it's wrapped around
a stack of cash.

647
00:46:25,721 --> 00:46:27,513
Maybe we can work it out in trade.

648
00:46:27,681 --> 00:46:31,014
I don't know. I ain't been sick
in three years, doc.

649
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:34,098
I got an idea.

650
00:46:41,943 --> 00:46:46,569
Where'd you learn to carve like that?
You're pretty darn good with a knife.

651
00:46:51,827 --> 00:46:53,866
- Hey, Maddie. Hey, Emma.
- Hi, doc.

652
00:46:54,037 --> 00:46:56,741
You guys are pig-sitting
for me tonight?

653
00:46:56,914 --> 00:46:58,408
Hey, Jasmine.

654
00:46:58,582 --> 00:47:00,207
- Who are you?
- Don't tease me.

655
00:47:00,375 --> 00:47:02,498
I'm serious.
You look like Lou, but prettier.

656
00:47:02,669 --> 00:47:06,251
I'm warning you, Stone, I could
probably whoop you in a fistfight.

657
00:47:06,422 --> 00:47:09,588
- Be a good girl.
- Bye.

658
00:47:09,758 --> 00:47:11,466
- Be a good girl.
- We'll be late.

659
00:47:11,635 --> 00:47:15,584
Not too much TV for her.
She's a real pig about that.

660
00:47:19,641 --> 00:47:24,801
Hi. Come on in. Welcome.
You look fantastic.

661
00:47:24,979 --> 00:47:26,722
- And you look handsome too.
- Thanks.

662
00:47:26,898 --> 00:47:29,981
Daddy's in the back yard tending
the firestorm in the barbecue.

663
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:34,562
- So you're Nick's daughter.
- Gosh, I hope so, I'm in his will.

664
00:47:34,737 --> 00:47:37,228
Hey, y'all, look who's here.

665
00:47:37,907 --> 00:47:40,065
Hello, Lou. Hello, Stone.

666
00:47:40,242 --> 00:47:42,069
Check Hollywood for knives.

667
00:47:42,244 --> 00:47:46,869
I don't want him operating on me later
in case I sneeze or something.

668
00:47:47,957 --> 00:47:50,163
Isn't this gonna be fun?

669
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:56,213
- Oh, no, thank you, I'm a vegetarian.
- I know, dear, but I'm still hopeful.

670
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:58,871
So am I. Vegetarian.

671
00:47:59,049 --> 00:48:01,754
- Since when?
- Then have some of this squash, Ben.

672
00:48:01,927 --> 00:48:03,504
Flesh of the earth. Don't be shy.

673
00:48:03,678 --> 00:48:06,881
I'm not sure I trust a man
who doesn't eat meat.

674
00:48:07,056 --> 00:48:10,804
Don't be so provincial.
Where's your sense of adventure?

675
00:48:10,976 --> 00:48:15,637
I'd probably give vegetarians a better rate
for life insurance than a smoker, though.

676
00:48:15,813 --> 00:48:18,565
On account of that
lower cholesterol factor.

677
00:48:18,732 --> 00:48:23,061
Daddy, please, new subject.
We wanna hear all about California.

678
00:48:23,236 --> 00:48:26,106
I heard the women out there
have their chests enlarged...

679
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,483
...their thighs vacuumed
and barf on purpose.

680
00:48:29,658 --> 00:48:31,781
Not while people are eating.

681
00:48:31,952 --> 00:48:35,320
Yeah, tell us about
real doctoring, Stone.

682
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:38,201
You know, big-city medicine.

683
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:42,074
So much has changed in the 40 years
since you went to medical school...

684
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:43,912
...I wouldn't know where to start.

685
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:47,455
- Smart-ass.
- Got you good.

686
00:48:47,965 --> 00:48:50,835
- More squash, Ben?
- No. I mean, no, thank you.

687
00:48:51,635 --> 00:48:56,841
<i>Out of the cradle
Endlessly rocking</i>

688
00:48:57,014 --> 00:49:00,465
<i>Out of the mockingbird's throat</i>

689
00:49:00,642 --> 00:49:03,429
<i>The musical shuttle</i>

690
00:49:03,603 --> 00:49:05,679
<i>Out of the ninth month</i>

691
00:49:05,855 --> 00:49:08,772
- Is this one of the long ones?
- No.

692
00:49:10,442 --> 00:49:12,233
Long ones?

693
00:49:12,903 --> 00:49:15,274
Doc Hogue does the complete
Walt Whitman...

694
00:49:15,447 --> 00:49:17,854
...if you don't monitor his drinking.

695
00:49:18,032 --> 00:49:21,614
<i>Down from the shower'd halo</i>

696
00:49:21,785 --> 00:49:25,865
<i>Up from the mystical play of shadows</i>

697
00:49:28,791 --> 00:49:32,159
Man, I haven't seen
this many stars in a long time.

698
00:49:32,628 --> 00:49:36,292
I used to get so bored in this town,
I'd try to count them.

699
00:49:36,631 --> 00:49:38,623
I could've gone to med school.

700
00:49:38,799 --> 00:49:42,713
Just the science part of it
I had a problem with.

701
00:49:42,886 --> 00:49:44,795
I'd lie on my back,
sometimes Wayne...

702
00:49:44,971 --> 00:49:47,343
...would be on top of me
doing the wild thing.

703
00:49:47,515 --> 00:49:50,718
- It was hard not to lose my place.
- God, that's romantic.

704
00:49:50,893 --> 00:49:52,470
Then we moved to Manhattan...

705
00:49:52,811 --> 00:49:55,480
...you could hardly see any stars,
let alone count them.

706
00:49:55,647 --> 00:49:58,683
The stars I'd like to see
are more of the two-legged kind.

707
00:49:58,858 --> 00:50:01,183
Earthquake insurance
is something I'm keen...

708
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,352
...to take a whack at out there in L.A.

709
00:50:03,528 --> 00:50:05,651
Talk about your no-brainer.

710
00:50:05,822 --> 00:50:10,033
Collect premiums for a gazillion years,
and if the big one ever does hit...

711
00:50:10,201 --> 00:50:13,201
...declare bankruptcy and retire.

712
00:50:14,913 --> 00:50:17,866
- Decent and solid.
- Nobody's perfect.

713
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,198
Hank, you gotta take Hogue home.

714
00:50:20,376 --> 00:50:22,783
He's about to launch
into "Song of Myself."

715
00:50:22,961 --> 00:50:24,835
My Lord.

716
00:50:25,297 --> 00:50:28,048
Never a dull moment,
hey, Ben Stone?

717
00:50:28,216 --> 00:50:30,089
I'll call you later.

718
00:50:30,467 --> 00:50:32,175
Make sure you got home okay.

719
00:50:50,109 --> 00:50:52,682
- Good night.
- Night.

720
00:51:28,099 --> 00:51:31,218
- I forgot my pig.
- She's sleeping with Em.

721
00:51:31,393 --> 00:51:33,884
I'll drop her off in the morning.

722
00:51:34,312 --> 00:51:37,396
Greek death? Take the edge off.

723
00:51:37,565 --> 00:51:39,854
Take the edge off what?

724
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,020
Me.

725
00:51:45,822 --> 00:51:50,946
- You ran all the way over here.
- Oh, yeah. I ran and...

726
00:51:51,118 --> 00:51:53,787
...walked. Got a stitch in my side.

727
00:51:53,954 --> 00:51:56,076
Why are you giving me
the full-court press...

728
00:51:56,247 --> 00:51:59,367
...if you're only leaving
in a couple of days anyway?

729
00:52:00,001 --> 00:52:01,660
You know, I don't know.

730
00:52:01,835 --> 00:52:06,960
It's like it's some kind
of mystical force.

731
00:52:07,132 --> 00:52:09,705
Force or hormones?

732
00:52:10,217 --> 00:52:12,459
Hey, come on.

733
00:52:12,636 --> 00:52:14,842
All I wanna do is talk.

734
00:52:17,182 --> 00:52:19,755
And get you sloppy drunk.

735
00:52:20,476 --> 00:52:22,267
Honesty. That's a new approach.

736
00:52:22,436 --> 00:52:27,512
I know. You're forcing me
into uncharted territory here.

737
00:52:28,441 --> 00:52:31,311
Hell, I might even try chastity.

738
00:52:32,111 --> 00:52:34,780
Seems to work for Hank.

739
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:41,858
Speak of the devil.

740
00:52:44,329 --> 00:52:47,994
Listen, maybe a rain check?

741
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:53,166
I never should have accepted
those flowers.

742
00:52:58,216 --> 00:52:59,793
What about tomorrow night?

743
00:52:59,967 --> 00:53:02,672
Desperation. I like this.

744
00:53:04,221 --> 00:53:10,803
Still, I wouldn't want the mayor to have
to lose 10 bucks over me, you know?

745
00:53:31,535 --> 00:53:32,910
Morning.

746
00:53:35,705 --> 00:53:37,532
Funny. Funny.

747
00:53:42,044 --> 00:53:46,337
Morning, doc.
That's a nice pig you got there!

748
00:53:46,673 --> 00:53:48,630
Yeah, that's what they tell me.

749
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:54,138
Hey, Mr. McClary, be careful you don't
get another hook in your finger!

750
00:53:54,304 --> 00:53:59,179
Don't worry, doc.
We're not using hooks today.

751
00:54:11,068 --> 00:54:13,559
It's all right. It's all right.

752
00:54:20,118 --> 00:54:24,280
- He's a nice pig, doc.
- It's a she, actually.

753
00:54:28,875 --> 00:54:31,081
Relax, will you?

754
00:54:32,461 --> 00:54:35,462
House calls are probably
my favorite part of the job.

755
00:54:35,631 --> 00:54:40,624
Just driving out into the country, seeing
what might pop up around the next bend.

756
00:54:41,385 --> 00:54:43,378
Rainbows.

757
00:54:43,637 --> 00:54:45,511
Frost on the kudzu.

758
00:54:46,264 --> 00:54:50,807
John Muir said it, " Most people
are on the world, not in it."

759
00:54:54,563 --> 00:54:55,891
What?

760
00:54:57,107 --> 00:54:58,933
Nothing.

761
00:55:01,736 --> 00:55:03,443
What?

762
00:55:16,915 --> 00:55:19,869
Listen, you better let me handle
this one alone.

763
00:55:20,043 --> 00:55:23,043
- Obstetrical exam.
- Okay.

764
00:55:24,004 --> 00:55:27,289
"So Jimmy Joe went over to
the Pakistani's house with a shotgun."

765
00:55:27,465 --> 00:55:30,916
Excuse me.
Jimmy Joe is Ellen's brother?

766
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:33,252
No, no. Boyfriend.

767
00:55:33,804 --> 00:55:36,046
I was stumped on that one too.

768
00:55:36,223 --> 00:55:39,389
"He stayed outside shooting holes
in the fella's foreign car...

769
00:55:39,559 --> 00:55:42,512
...until Ellen came out and agreed
to come back home with him.

770
00:55:42,687 --> 00:55:46,020
It's the most romantic thing
Jimmy Joe has ever done for her."

771
00:55:52,028 --> 00:55:53,522
Tough one.

772
00:55:53,696 --> 00:55:57,278
How's Ellen making out
with the Pakistani man?

773
00:56:00,285 --> 00:56:01,862
Get him, get him. Come on, Bubba.

774
00:56:04,371 --> 00:56:08,203
I said... I said, no shots.

775
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:20,382
This won't hurt.

776
00:56:20,551 --> 00:56:23,338
Well, I don't see an infection.

777
00:56:23,596 --> 00:56:25,387
But...

778
00:56:27,974 --> 00:56:30,132
Okay, hold still.

779
00:56:34,396 --> 00:56:37,065
- What is that, a V8?
- He did it.

780
00:56:39,651 --> 00:56:43,315
You know, house calls used to be
essential to every doctor's practice.

781
00:56:43,487 --> 00:56:46,523
The only way to know your patients
was to see where they live.

782
00:56:46,698 --> 00:56:48,774
How they lived.

783
00:56:49,492 --> 00:56:51,235
Maybe when I get to Halberstrom's...

784
00:56:51,411 --> 00:56:54,446
...I'll get them to institute some kind
of visitation program.

785
00:56:54,622 --> 00:56:55,950
Damn it.

786
00:57:00,585 --> 00:57:02,293
Lou?

787
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:07,255
Hey, Lou!

788
00:57:10,843 --> 00:57:13,548
Do you see another one?
They mark their way with these.

789
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:17,765
They're too stupid or too drunk to
remember where they were most times.

790
00:57:17,933 --> 00:57:20,470
- Who?
- Hunters.

791
00:57:21,144 --> 00:57:24,393
Maybe this is the end of...
Yeah. See, there it is.

792
00:57:24,563 --> 00:57:27,018
That's where they sit
and wait for the slaughter.

793
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:31,602
It's not like they do it for food either.
God, it gets me so hot.

794
00:57:36,657 --> 00:57:38,982
You wanna help me here?

795
00:57:39,492 --> 00:57:40,903
What are you doing?

796
00:57:41,869 --> 00:57:43,328
I'm urinating.

797
00:57:44,788 --> 00:57:47,742
You just drop trou
whenever you feel like it.

798
00:57:47,916 --> 00:57:51,913
Well, it scares the deer away
so the hunters won't get them.

799
00:57:53,879 --> 00:57:56,631
Why don't you just, you know,
say "boo" or something?

800
00:57:56,799 --> 00:58:00,630
I try to spread it around.
A little here, a little there.

801
00:58:02,261 --> 00:58:04,633
Feel free to join in.

802
00:58:27,366 --> 00:58:31,197
Anyway, it's not like I planned
to be pregnant at 19...

803
00:58:31,369 --> 00:58:33,445
...but it could have been worse
than Wayne.

804
00:58:33,621 --> 00:58:35,779
Wendall Barnes.

805
00:58:35,956 --> 00:58:37,331
You'd be interested in him.

806
00:58:37,499 --> 00:58:40,702
He comes from a whole family
that doesn't have sweat glands.

807
00:58:40,877 --> 00:58:43,996
Really? I'm fascinated
by the gland-less.

808
00:58:44,171 --> 00:58:45,500
I guess it's genetic.

809
00:58:45,673 --> 00:58:49,171
During the summer, they all sleep under
the house on account of the heat.

810
00:58:49,342 --> 00:58:52,675
That's a touching story. Really.
Thanks for sharing that with me.

811
00:58:52,845 --> 00:58:56,593
You don't see a lot of things in Grady,
but what you do see, you see a lot of.

812
00:58:56,765 --> 00:58:58,804
Yeah, I'm from a small town myself.

813
00:58:59,267 --> 00:59:00,927
What?

814
00:59:02,395 --> 00:59:07,103
Marionville, Indiana.
Population: 2106.

815
00:59:07,274 --> 00:59:10,393
Home of the world's largest
steam engine.

816
00:59:10,902 --> 00:59:12,562
But you told everybody that you...

817
00:59:12,737 --> 00:59:16,604
No, no, no. Everybody assumed
I was a big-city guy.

818
00:59:16,782 --> 00:59:19,107
Nobody asked.

819
00:59:19,284 --> 00:59:21,905
Anyway, I got out,
and I'm staying out.

820
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:26,951
Have you still got
your whole family there?

821
00:59:27,124 --> 00:59:29,531
Well, they talked about leaving...

822
00:59:29,709 --> 00:59:32,461
...but my dad never quite...

823
00:59:33,546 --> 00:59:35,834
They lived there, they died there.

824
00:59:36,006 --> 00:59:38,248
For better or for worse.

825
00:59:38,759 --> 00:59:43,135
So when I left home, I swore
to myself I was never going back.

826
00:59:44,096 --> 00:59:46,765
It's not the place, it's the person.

827
00:59:47,724 --> 00:59:50,974
Be careful what you wish for,
Ben Stone, you might get it.

828
00:59:51,186 --> 00:59:52,728
What's that supposed to mean?

829
00:59:52,895 --> 00:59:55,564
You never been back,
not even to see your friends?

830
00:59:55,731 --> 00:59:58,981
Well, who's got time for friends?

831
01:00:03,529 --> 01:00:06,898
<i>No, you gotta get Dr. Stone
back here ASAP.</i>

832
01:00:07,074 --> 01:00:09,232
<i>We got a possible
coronary emergency.</i>

833
01:00:09,409 --> 01:00:13,406
<i>- Can't Doc Hogue handle this?
- It is Hogue. Over.</i>

834
01:00:17,291 --> 01:00:19,746
- Hey, lie down.
- Oh, crap, I'm doomed.

835
01:00:20,127 --> 01:00:22,119
Lie down now.
You're having a heart attack.

836
01:00:22,295 --> 01:00:24,334
My angina's acting up is all.

837
01:00:24,505 --> 01:00:27,671
- Got any nitro pills down there?
- No, get a bolus of lidocaine.

838
01:00:27,841 --> 01:00:30,213
I'm the senior sawbones around here.

839
01:00:30,385 --> 01:00:33,754
PVCs are too close to your T-waves.
In 30 seconds, you're in trouble.

840
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:35,388
Get him away from me.

841
01:00:35,556 --> 01:00:39,256
If I'm wrong, lidocaine won't hurt.
If you're wrong, it's a ventricular fib.

842
01:00:39,434 --> 01:00:41,059
I'm never wrong.

843
01:00:42,604 --> 01:00:45,059
Get the defibrillator over here.

844
01:00:45,314 --> 01:00:46,773
Never wrong.

845
01:00:46,982 --> 01:00:49,021
Four hundred watts.

846
01:00:49,318 --> 01:00:50,646
Clear. Clear!

847
01:00:53,279 --> 01:00:54,903
Heartbeat.

848
01:00:55,072 --> 01:00:58,441
- Sixty.
- Wow, you mean he actually has one.

849
01:00:58,617 --> 01:01:01,190
Keep him on oxygen
and set the lidocaine drip.

850
01:01:02,287 --> 01:01:04,279
Guess I'm staying here tonight.

851
01:01:17,675 --> 01:01:19,252
Oh, doctor.

852
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:21,751
I've got your bed ready.

853
01:01:23,972 --> 01:01:25,513
Right.

854
01:01:29,685 --> 01:01:31,013
Sleep well, doctor.

855
01:01:39,443 --> 01:01:41,815
At which point, all the bees,
including Melvin...

856
01:01:41,987 --> 01:01:44,477
...lunged off the edge
of the stage like lemmings.

857
01:01:44,655 --> 01:01:47,526
- A standing ovation.
- Variations on a theme.

858
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:49,110
Sorry I missed it.

859
01:01:49,284 --> 01:01:52,735
That's the first squash pageant
that I missed in 15 years.

860
01:01:52,912 --> 01:01:54,323
What's going on here?

861
01:01:54,497 --> 01:01:58,576
It's called moral support
for the recovering patient.

862
01:01:58,751 --> 01:02:00,244
Cherry cobbler, Ben?

863
01:02:00,419 --> 01:02:04,498
Everybody out. Let's go.
Come on, visiting hours are over.

864
01:02:04,672 --> 01:02:09,380
Don't mind Doc Hollywood. He doesn't
know what it means to be beloved.

865
01:02:11,261 --> 01:02:14,926
If you've come to clean the room,
my bedpan's ripe.

866
01:02:19,643 --> 01:02:22,976
Oh, no.
Not Maddie's sweet potato pie.

867
01:02:23,146 --> 01:02:25,815
You can razz me all you want, doc.

868
01:02:26,274 --> 01:02:29,025
I saved your life last night.

869
01:02:29,276 --> 01:02:32,230
You know it, and I know it.

870
01:02:33,196 --> 01:02:34,987
Gotcha.

871
01:04:06,858 --> 01:04:10,024
Dr. Halberstrom, please.
It's Ben Stone calling.

872
01:04:10,903 --> 01:04:13,144
It's regarding...

873
01:04:13,697 --> 01:04:18,358
I'm not gonna be able to make
my interview on Friday.

874
01:04:18,951 --> 01:04:24,157
I realize the doctor has a tight schedule.
I'm not gonna be able to leave without...

875
01:04:26,207 --> 01:04:27,535
Right.

876
01:04:27,708 --> 01:04:31,788
Is there any way that he can reschedule
the appointment for another time?

877
01:04:32,546 --> 01:04:35,297
All right. Thanks a lot.

878
01:05:04,531 --> 01:05:07,981
Here you go. Get hot and take a shot.
Get hot and take a shot.

879
01:05:08,159 --> 01:05:09,818
What's the object of this one, pal?

880
01:05:09,994 --> 01:05:12,365
Ten shots a dollar.
Five bull's-eyes win a possum.

881
01:05:12,537 --> 01:05:16,155
- Suppose I was to hit five out of five.
- I'll give you two possums.

882
01:05:24,881 --> 01:05:29,626
Sir, run Henry a tab.
He feels deadly today.

883
01:05:32,012 --> 01:05:34,549
Evening, Dr. Stone.

884
01:05:47,733 --> 01:05:49,109
Hey, doc.

885
01:05:51,987 --> 01:05:55,153
The new one's in.
Your chariot's good as new.

886
01:05:55,323 --> 01:05:57,730
Or good as new used, since it's old.

887
01:05:57,909 --> 01:06:00,826
- You fixed my car?
- Even all the ashtrays.

888
01:06:00,994 --> 01:06:03,200
Oh, man, I can't believe this.

889
01:06:03,371 --> 01:06:04,700
Melvin, thanks, man.

890
01:06:06,958 --> 01:06:08,749
There's always some extra parts...

891
01:06:08,918 --> 01:06:11,325
...when I put them back together.
I don't know why.

892
01:06:11,503 --> 01:06:14,836
But you go ahead on. Keep them.

893
01:06:19,427 --> 01:06:21,668
- Dance with me or I'm dog food.
- What?

894
01:06:21,845 --> 01:06:25,214
- Wendall Barnes.
- Of the gland-less Barnes?

895
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:27,715
- Jesus.
- Yeah. Come on.

896
01:06:27,892 --> 01:06:30,180
Absolutely.

897
01:06:45,532 --> 01:06:47,358
You see, the trick...

898
01:06:47,992 --> 01:06:52,155
...is just to visualize the target
on the backs of your eyeballs...

899
01:06:52,329 --> 01:06:57,286
...and then pretend you're just
shooting yourself in the eye.

900
01:07:04,798 --> 01:07:07,086
I can't keep up.

901
01:07:25,774 --> 01:07:27,481
How's Hogue?

902
01:07:27,650 --> 01:07:29,310
Meaner than ever.

903
01:07:36,324 --> 01:07:38,151
Dance?

904
01:07:44,414 --> 01:07:46,406
Where's Hank?

905
01:07:46,666 --> 01:07:48,575
I forget.

906
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:53,221
The music stopped.

907
01:09:53,772 --> 01:09:55,681
What music?

908
01:09:59,652 --> 01:10:01,443
Dr. Stone.

909
01:10:01,904 --> 01:10:05,107
- I have a present for you.
- Thanks, judge.

910
01:10:05,282 --> 01:10:09,195
I want to thank you for saving
my old friend Hogue's miserable life.

911
01:10:09,369 --> 01:10:11,657
I wouldn't be able
to call myself a Christian...

912
01:10:11,829 --> 01:10:14,616
...if I didn't pardon you
on the remainder of your sentence.

913
01:10:14,790 --> 01:10:16,829
You're free to go
whenever you want.

914
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,206
What I wouldn't give to be young
on the road...

915
01:10:19,377 --> 01:10:22,212
...footloose and fancy-free.

916
01:10:22,379 --> 01:10:25,582
Did I tell you? I've already got plans
for a new fence.

917
01:10:25,757 --> 01:10:28,129
All of a sudden,
I got a bug in my ear...

918
01:10:28,301 --> 01:10:31,551
...for one of those solid-oak numbers
with curly tops.

919
01:10:34,014 --> 01:10:35,722
Victory.

920
01:10:35,891 --> 01:10:38,132
Did you kill that critter
all by yourself?

921
01:10:38,309 --> 01:10:39,803
Very funny.

922
01:10:39,977 --> 01:10:44,722
Don't you have some urgent business
thousands of miles away from here?

923
01:10:44,898 --> 01:10:48,895
Vialula, your daughter was dumping
grasshoppers in the punch bowl again.

924
01:10:49,068 --> 01:10:50,183
Only two.

925
01:10:50,361 --> 01:10:56,149
- Shake a leg with the judicial branch?
- Why, I'd love to. Thank you.

926
01:10:56,741 --> 01:10:58,200
Would you hold this possum?

927
01:10:58,368 --> 01:11:01,902
I think it's time I reacquainted
your mama with some real dancing.

928
01:11:02,079 --> 01:11:04,748
No offense, Hollywood.

929
01:11:10,503 --> 01:11:13,076
When you gonna bring
your pig back around?

930
01:11:22,596 --> 01:11:25,513
Hey there, Ben Stone.
Hey, how are you?

931
01:11:25,682 --> 01:11:27,888
Been looking for you.
What a great day.

932
01:11:28,059 --> 01:11:30,632
Boy, this is it.

933
01:11:30,812 --> 01:11:34,227
The pinnacle of existence,
the grandeur of Grady.

934
01:11:34,398 --> 01:11:36,639
Sap of life.
Couldn't be happier if I was twins.

935
01:11:36,817 --> 01:11:40,766
- You put on a hell of a festival, mayor.
- Ain't you nice to say so.

936
01:11:40,945 --> 01:11:44,894
Ben, let's talk turkey.
Or squash, as it were.

937
01:11:45,073 --> 01:11:47,445
- About what?
- Home.

938
01:11:47,617 --> 01:11:48,945
Heart.

939
01:11:49,119 --> 01:11:50,660
Happiness.

940
01:11:50,828 --> 01:11:52,571
You belong here, Ben Stone.

941
01:11:52,747 --> 01:11:56,696
Breaks my heart to think of you
out there in the land of lunatics.

942
01:11:56,875 --> 01:12:00,243
I'm danged if I'll let you go
without holding up a mirror to your face.

943
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:04,464
Like that smile of contentment there.
So you see that? See there?

944
01:12:04,631 --> 01:12:08,842
That's a face that's liked and loved.
A face with friends and a future.

945
01:12:09,010 --> 01:12:11,501
Can't find some other way
to force me to stay?

946
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:13,054
Ben.

947
01:12:13,222 --> 01:12:15,095
I am everything but devious.

948
01:12:15,265 --> 01:12:18,800
Mayor, could you come check
these ribs and tell me if they're done?

949
01:12:18,977 --> 01:12:20,720
I sure can.

950
01:12:20,895 --> 01:12:23,101
Rigors of the job, huh?

951
01:12:23,522 --> 01:12:27,899
Well, you got your fire way too high,
I'll tell you that.

952
01:12:28,401 --> 01:12:29,776
Well, don't do that.

953
01:12:31,863 --> 01:12:34,946
Come on, come on.

954
01:12:37,492 --> 01:12:39,817
- Hi, doc.
- Gentlemen.

955
01:13:16,608 --> 01:13:18,897
Careful with those things.

956
01:13:35,791 --> 01:13:39,705
I know I shouldn't be doing this because
you're leaving, but I don't care.

957
01:13:39,878 --> 01:13:41,787
I can't help it.

958
01:13:41,963 --> 01:13:43,622
So get in.

959
01:13:43,923 --> 01:13:47,967
- Do you mean what I think you mean?
- Just get in if you're gonna get in.

960
01:13:54,473 --> 01:13:57,308
Lou, I gotta be honest with you.

961
01:13:57,476 --> 01:14:00,346
Rowing a boat is not
what I had in mind.

962
01:14:04,732 --> 01:14:06,439
Not bad, huh?

963
01:14:09,861 --> 01:14:11,189
Incredible.

964
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:15,402
- What was that?
- Freshwater mullet.

965
01:14:15,574 --> 01:14:19,820
They see the sparks from the skyrockets,
think it's food and jump for it.

966
01:14:19,994 --> 01:14:22,034
That's scary.

967
01:14:22,288 --> 01:14:24,327
Maybe I could...

968
01:14:24,832 --> 01:14:27,038
...sit next to you,
and you could protect me.

969
01:14:27,209 --> 01:14:29,331
No. You'll throw us off balance.

970
01:14:29,502 --> 01:14:31,744
I want you off balance.

971
01:14:31,921 --> 01:14:33,913
- He's in the boat!
- Hold still.

972
01:14:34,090 --> 01:14:36,082
- Get him.
- Watch it, you'll tip us over.

973
01:14:36,258 --> 01:14:38,416
- Get him, Lou.
- Okay, I got it.

974
01:14:43,222 --> 01:14:45,629
You did that on purpose.

975
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:49,138
All right, I admit it.

976
01:14:49,603 --> 01:14:53,434
I worked my way through college
by training bass.

977
01:15:17,042 --> 01:15:18,417
Lou?

978
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:20,869
It's okay.

979
01:15:21,713 --> 01:15:24,168
Listen, if you don't wanna...

980
01:15:24,715 --> 01:15:28,759
Ben, I don't think I've ever wanted
anything more in my entire life, ever.

981
01:15:29,469 --> 01:15:32,885
I'm just not used to being
a one-night stand.

982
01:15:35,599 --> 01:15:38,683
You don't have to be.
I mean, I could...

983
01:15:38,894 --> 01:15:42,558
No. I wouldn't know what to do
with myself in Los Angeles.

984
01:15:42,730 --> 01:15:45,268
There are too many choices.

985
01:15:46,817 --> 01:15:49,486
Let's not think about it, okay?

986
01:15:55,116 --> 01:15:57,274
I can't do this.

987
01:16:09,461 --> 01:16:14,087
Mind walking from here? I don't wanna
give the gossips any more fat to chew.

988
01:16:16,634 --> 01:16:18,377
Right.

989
01:16:19,219 --> 01:16:22,255
Don't worry, Benjamin,
it'll all work out.

990
01:16:41,863 --> 01:16:43,855
Hey, Jasmine.

991
01:17:05,049 --> 01:17:06,626
Hey, Hank.

992
01:17:07,551 --> 01:17:11,251
You've made me real mad.

993
01:17:12,889 --> 01:17:14,431
About what?

994
01:17:14,599 --> 01:17:16,591
What do you think?

995
01:17:16,767 --> 01:17:19,970
I know you were out on that lake
with her.

996
01:17:20,228 --> 01:17:23,597
It makes me sick
to think of you and her.

997
01:17:23,773 --> 01:17:26,180
- Nothing happened.
- Oh, right.

998
01:17:26,358 --> 01:17:28,516
Nothing happened!

999
01:17:28,694 --> 01:17:30,852
Come on, tough guy!
Come on, country boy!

1000
01:17:31,029 --> 01:17:33,780
You wanna take a shot at me, huh?
Come on!

1001
01:17:33,948 --> 01:17:36,735
- What are you doing?
- Come on, country boy, get up! Let's go.

1002
01:17:37,326 --> 01:17:38,950
Are you paranoid or something?

1003
01:17:41,621 --> 01:17:43,245
No.

1004
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:46,281
But I'm a little confused.

1005
01:17:54,424 --> 01:17:56,879
I suppose you and her
will be getting married now.

1006
01:18:03,473 --> 01:18:05,548
It's the Southern way.

1007
01:18:05,725 --> 01:18:08,429
Man and woman as one.

1008
01:18:08,769 --> 01:18:14,224
Make sacrifices to build equity
in a future that has security.

1009
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:17,263
Why do you sound like
a Mutual of Omaha ad?

1010
01:18:17,568 --> 01:18:19,607
Fine, joke it up.

1011
01:18:19,778 --> 01:18:21,984
At least I was prepared to marry her.

1012
01:18:24,657 --> 01:18:26,199
She's not in love with you.

1013
01:18:27,368 --> 01:18:30,072
Okay. That's the only
roadblock, though.

1014
01:18:33,748 --> 01:18:35,787
Let me ask you something.

1015
01:18:36,751 --> 01:18:40,617
Don't you think a guy is entitled
to choose his own destiny?

1016
01:18:41,213 --> 01:18:43,917
Whether it's in a small town
or even in California.

1017
01:18:44,090 --> 01:18:46,545
It's just that he shouldn't have it
handed to him.

1018
01:18:46,717 --> 01:18:50,086
Not like it's a... You know, like...

1019
01:18:50,262 --> 01:18:51,922
A hat?

1020
01:18:54,015 --> 01:18:56,340
Right. Okay, good. Like a hat.

1021
01:18:56,517 --> 01:18:59,802
Your father and your grandfather wore it,
now you're stuck with it.

1022
01:18:59,978 --> 01:19:02,683
Only the damn thing is too small.
It just doesn't fit.

1023
01:19:02,856 --> 01:19:08,098
- I hate a tight hat.
- There's a lot of hats out there.

1024
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:12,060
And even if this one fits...

1025
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:14,030
...and I'm not saying that it does...

1026
01:19:14,198 --> 01:19:18,278
...how do you know it's the right one
when you haven't tried any others on?

1027
01:19:18,452 --> 01:19:20,658
I sure haven't.

1028
01:19:22,247 --> 01:19:24,654
I mean, that's what
I'm talking about.

1029
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:28,501
I just don't wanna screw up her life.

1030
01:19:29,711 --> 01:19:31,834
You know, Hollywood...

1031
01:19:32,005 --> 01:19:36,334
...sometimes a man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do.

1032
01:19:36,509 --> 01:19:41,419
And maybe...
Maybe it's in California.

1033
01:19:43,473 --> 01:19:45,880
Yeah, maybe you're right.

1034
01:19:47,101 --> 01:19:51,180
- Well, I'm glad we got that cleaned up.
- Me too, Hank.

1035
01:19:51,355 --> 01:19:53,845
Don't that take the rag off the bush?

1036
01:19:54,023 --> 01:19:56,395
Don't forget what I told you.

1037
01:20:59,912 --> 01:21:01,240
Hey, please!

1038
01:21:05,041 --> 01:21:07,033
Shit.

1039
01:21:16,134 --> 01:21:18,090
Shit.

1040
01:21:18,302 --> 01:21:20,010
Shit.

1041
01:21:32,064 --> 01:21:33,855
Dr. Stone.

1042
01:21:34,024 --> 01:21:36,146
Mary. Decided to drop by,
see how you were doing.

1043
01:21:36,317 --> 01:21:40,480
No damn good. Water's broke. I hurt.
This ain't like none of the others.

1044
01:21:40,654 --> 01:21:42,611
They never are.

1045
01:21:43,615 --> 01:21:46,734
Did Doc Hogue tell you this baby
might come out the wrong way?

1046
01:21:47,952 --> 01:21:50,656
He's coming.
He don't care which way.

1047
01:21:52,331 --> 01:21:55,664
- Fiddlesticks. Don't push, Mary.
- I can run, get an ambulance.

1048
01:21:55,833 --> 01:21:59,498
There's no time for that. Go into my
duffle bag, there's four clean shirts.

1049
01:21:59,670 --> 01:22:02,540
Get them and rip them
into even pieces.

1050
01:22:03,381 --> 01:22:07,248
Listen, Mary, don't push. I know
you want to, but don't push.

1051
01:22:07,426 --> 01:22:09,964
I'll try to turn him around
so he comes the right way.

1052
01:22:10,596 --> 01:22:12,553
Is it these ones?

1053
01:22:12,723 --> 01:22:17,183
- "Aramana"?
- Armani. Those are the ones.

1054
01:22:21,605 --> 01:22:25,519
Okay, now. Now! That's it.
Great. Great. Great.

1055
01:22:25,692 --> 01:22:27,814
Okay, okay, okay.

1056
01:22:28,527 --> 01:22:32,145
Now go! Push. Push, Mary.
You're doing great.

1057
01:22:32,322 --> 01:22:34,445
You're doing great.

1058
01:22:34,949 --> 01:22:37,025
I got a leg. I got a leg.

1059
01:22:45,166 --> 01:22:48,582
All right. Go ahead, go ahead.

1060
01:22:49,170 --> 01:22:51,043
Someone's coming.

1061
01:22:51,213 --> 01:22:54,249
Doc, someone's coming.

1062
01:22:55,050 --> 01:22:57,006
Okay, all right.

1063
01:23:01,805 --> 01:23:03,762
Push! Push, Mary!

1064
01:23:13,648 --> 01:23:14,977
Doc, your car.

1065
01:23:17,235 --> 01:23:18,812
What do I do?

1066
01:23:20,196 --> 01:23:21,939
Okay.

1067
01:23:23,156 --> 01:23:25,445
- Good girl!
- What do I do?

1068
01:23:25,617 --> 01:23:26,945
Push, Mary.

1069
01:23:31,038 --> 01:23:32,698
It's a girl!

1070
01:24:07,944 --> 01:24:10,517
I think I can fix that.

1071
01:24:25,792 --> 01:24:28,911
- You rang?
- First breech you ever delivered?

1072
01:24:30,463 --> 01:24:32,751
First baby I ever delivered.

1073
01:24:32,923 --> 01:24:34,251
By myself.

1074
01:24:35,175 --> 01:24:37,748
- Whiskey?
- No, thanks.

1075
01:24:37,927 --> 01:24:40,465
In fact, I wouldn't recommend that
for you, either.

1076
01:24:40,638 --> 01:24:43,307
You're not my doctor,
and you're not my wife...

1077
01:24:43,473 --> 01:24:46,557
...so I guess you don't have
very much to say about it.

1078
01:24:48,978 --> 01:24:51,895
You're not fixing to stay, huh, Stone?

1079
01:24:52,064 --> 01:24:54,389
Changed your mind, huh?

1080
01:24:54,566 --> 01:24:57,235
Now that your car's
all busted to bubkes...

1081
01:24:57,402 --> 01:25:01,185
...and you're feeling pretty good
about yourself in general, huh?

1082
01:25:03,031 --> 01:25:04,360
Come here.

1083
01:25:12,623 --> 01:25:14,995
I had them up once.

1084
01:25:15,167 --> 01:25:19,116
Over 700 babies I delivered
in this town over the years.

1085
01:25:19,295 --> 01:25:20,623
Nurse Packer.

1086
01:25:20,796 --> 01:25:25,872
She popped right out complete with
teeth and hair and bit me. An omen.

1087
01:25:26,051 --> 01:25:27,379
Nicholson.

1088
01:25:27,552 --> 01:25:29,260
Hank.

1089
01:25:30,262 --> 01:25:35,220
I gave them birth, saw them through
every sneeze and sniffle...

1090
01:25:35,392 --> 01:25:38,725
...and sometimes even walked them
to the gravesite.

1091
01:25:39,479 --> 01:25:43,428
They're pretty well
my portfolio, Stone.

1092
01:25:43,607 --> 01:25:47,984
That and an old car, an old house.

1093
01:25:48,361 --> 01:25:51,611
I wouldn't trade any of them for gold.

1094
01:25:52,448 --> 01:25:54,654
Well, maybe gold.

1095
01:25:55,325 --> 01:25:57,650
Or cash money.

1096
01:26:01,205 --> 01:26:03,078
- Hey.
- Doc.

1097
01:26:04,082 --> 01:26:05,956
Hey, Mary, how's our girl?

1098
01:26:06,126 --> 01:26:09,957
We decided she's gonna be
"Benjamina," after you.

1099
01:26:10,838 --> 01:26:12,711
What?

1100
01:26:13,507 --> 01:26:15,333
Thank you.

1101
01:26:15,801 --> 01:26:19,003
There's an obstetrician coming up
from Athens General later...

1102
01:26:19,178 --> 01:26:21,634
...just to make sure everything's okay.

1103
01:26:22,890 --> 01:26:24,549
Benjamina.

1104
01:26:26,434 --> 01:26:30,894
Yo, doc, I wanted to just thank you
for, you know, everything...

1105
01:26:31,063 --> 01:26:34,064
...so I made you this in appreciation.

1106
01:26:34,775 --> 01:26:40,112
I know it ain't very much, so if there's
ever anything at all I can do for you...

1107
01:26:40,279 --> 01:26:44,775
Just let me know what happens
with Ellen, Jimmy Joe and the Pakistani.

1108
01:27:04,841 --> 01:27:07,047
I heard what happened last night.
You did great.

1109
01:27:07,844 --> 01:27:12,137
- I didn't know what I was doing.
- Well, sometimes that's the best way.

1110
01:27:13,599 --> 01:27:15,556
There's something
that I wanted to say.

1111
01:27:15,726 --> 01:27:19,723
Something I wanted to say
to you first. Is that okay?

1112
01:27:20,313 --> 01:27:24,773
So I've been doing a lot of thinking
about last night.

1113
01:27:24,942 --> 01:27:27,859
Last night was really difficult.

1114
01:27:28,153 --> 01:27:33,063
Everything's all turned around now.
I've been thinking about you and me...

1115
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:36,774
...and big cities, small towns...
- Well, I'm gonna marry Hank.

1116
01:27:38,912 --> 01:27:40,987
I've decided.

1117
01:27:45,083 --> 01:27:47,123
It's a plane ticket to Los Angeles.

1118
01:27:47,752 --> 01:27:49,626
The whole town chipped in.

1119
01:27:49,796 --> 01:27:54,753
We've kept you here this long, and if you
wait for Melvin to fix your car again...

1120
01:27:56,885 --> 01:27:59,173
You got Los Angeles waiting for you.

1121
01:27:59,345 --> 01:28:02,381
I've got Emma. It's not fair to you.

1122
01:28:02,556 --> 01:28:05,510
Hank's steady, and he's here.

1123
01:28:05,684 --> 01:28:07,392
You...

1124
01:28:08,186 --> 01:28:12,265
You're like a big, bright shooting star and
you're right, Ben, you'd burn out here.

1125
01:28:17,819 --> 01:28:19,479
Wait a minute.

1126
01:28:25,075 --> 01:28:28,325
Well, Ben Stone, you have five minutes
to say goodbye to Shangri-la.

1127
01:28:28,495 --> 01:28:32,029
Cotton will give you a police escort
to the airport.

1128
01:28:39,462 --> 01:28:41,834
We made you a sack lunch.

1129
01:28:42,006 --> 01:28:44,413
Airplane food can cause gas.

1130
01:28:50,513 --> 01:28:52,754
I guess I'll watch after your pig.

1131
01:28:52,932 --> 01:28:56,300
Just hope she takes to the farm
after living in town like this.

1132
01:28:56,977 --> 01:28:58,934
Appreciate it.

1133
01:28:59,395 --> 01:29:01,933
A lot of folks around here
gonna miss you.

1134
01:29:02,773 --> 01:29:06,307
I don't mean me.
But a lot of folks.

1135
01:29:38,261 --> 01:29:39,755
Adieu.

1136
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:51,271
Back to the interstate,
Ben Stone, huh?

1137
01:29:51,439 --> 01:29:52,897
Back to the interstate.

1138
01:31:24,558 --> 01:31:26,515
You okay?

1139
01:31:27,394 --> 01:31:29,932
Oh, yes, I am fine.

1140
01:31:34,859 --> 01:31:38,607
Good morning, Halberstrom Clinic.
Could you hold, please.

1141
01:31:38,779 --> 01:31:42,858
Good morning, Halberstrom Clinic.
Good morning, Halberstrom Clinic.

1142
01:31:44,241 --> 01:31:46,447
Oh, hold. Yes, doctor.

1143
01:31:47,286 --> 01:31:49,492
- Mr. Stone?
- Dr. Stone.

1144
01:31:51,706 --> 01:31:53,745
Dr. Halberstrom can see you now.

1145
01:32:08,470 --> 01:32:11,755
Do you have any idea how many
applications I went through this year?

1146
01:32:11,931 --> 01:32:14,766
Yes, sir. That's why I knew
this interview was important.

1147
01:32:14,934 --> 01:32:17,768
I would've been here earlier
if I could've been. I think...

1148
01:32:17,936 --> 01:32:22,514
I know you're a great surgeon, Stone.
That whole pile is full of great surgeons.

1149
01:32:22,899 --> 01:32:24,808
Did you expect special consideration...

1150
01:32:24,984 --> 01:32:26,976
...because we're from
the same hometown?

1151
01:32:27,152 --> 01:32:29,310
- Because I knew your father?
- No, sir.

1152
01:32:29,488 --> 01:32:32,156
Good. Because you didn't get shit.

1153
01:32:32,323 --> 01:32:36,735
You wouldn't be here at all if it weren't
for a call I got from Dr. Aurelius Hogue.

1154
01:32:39,079 --> 01:32:40,573
Dr. Hogue called you?

1155
01:32:40,747 --> 01:32:43,783
I saw two doctors last week
with more experience than you...

1156
01:32:43,958 --> 01:32:46,662
...and better board certification scores.

1157
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:50,955
Dr. Hogue's a piece of work, isn't he?

1158
01:32:51,297 --> 01:32:52,673
What did he say?

1159
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:56,624
That you were doing volunteer
family practice down South somewhere.

1160
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:02,634
Yes. Yeah. Yes, yes, that's right.

1161
01:33:03,391 --> 01:33:07,055
Went there to get that small-town chip
off your shoulder, didn't you?

1162
01:33:07,227 --> 01:33:11,355
- Yeah.
- Well, you're braver than I was, Stone.

1163
01:33:11,523 --> 01:33:14,689
Any case,
Hogue said you were, quote:

1164
01:33:14,859 --> 01:33:18,808
"One hellaciously fine physician."

1165
01:33:18,987 --> 01:33:22,819
That I would be " a bovine,
clodpated, citified moron"...

1166
01:33:22,991 --> 01:33:25,446
...if I didn't hire you on the spot.

1167
01:33:25,618 --> 01:33:27,575
I wrote it down so I wouldn't forget.

1168
01:33:27,745 --> 01:33:30,496
So I guess you're in, Stone. Congrats.

1169
01:33:30,664 --> 01:33:32,656
What time do I tee off?

1170
01:33:32,832 --> 01:33:35,074
You do play golf, don't you?

1171
01:33:35,251 --> 01:33:38,584
Great. Don't worry about that.
It's not anywhere you can see it.

1172
01:33:38,754 --> 01:33:42,667
The secret to this business is to get
a good pace going for yourself.

1173
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:46,672
Nobody likes to admit it,
but medicine's a volume business.

1174
01:33:46,844 --> 01:33:49,548
Ninety-nine percent of what we do
is boilerplate surgery.

1175
01:33:49,721 --> 01:33:52,556
It means we can afford
the one percent that's meaningful.

1176
01:33:52,724 --> 01:33:56,472
Disfigurements, birth defects,
hare lips.

1177
01:33:57,478 --> 01:34:00,763
Cleft palates.
You live for those moments.

1178
01:34:00,939 --> 01:34:03,062
The bigger you get, the bigger the nut.

1179
01:34:03,232 --> 01:34:07,064
We're a service industry. Comes with
the territory. Fixed costs, specialization.

1180
01:34:07,236 --> 01:34:09,987
People adjust to it or fail.
Look at cable TV.

1181
01:34:10,155 --> 01:34:12,361
You're gonna see
some changes, Stone.

1182
01:34:13,032 --> 01:34:17,492
Stone, see if patient number 434
is in preop yet.

1183
01:34:17,661 --> 01:34:21,030
We can squeeze one more in
before lunch, don't you think?

1184
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:04,030
<i>Hi. This is
the National Weather Service forecast...</i>

1185
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:06,572
<i>... for the greater Grady area tomorrow.</i>

1186
01:35:06,744 --> 01:35:09,744
<i>There'll be plenty of sunshine
and blue skies.</i>

1187
01:35:09,913 --> 01:35:12,664
<i>The old temperature
should be in the 90s again...</i>

1188
01:35:12,832 --> 01:35:17,125
<i>... but a cool afternoon breeze will
make it all worthwhile come evening.</i>

1189
01:35:17,294 --> 01:35:21,208
<i>Y'all look out for the lightning bugs
after sunset.</i>

1190
01:35:40,939 --> 01:35:43,346
- Actress alert.
- Excuse me.

1191
01:35:43,525 --> 01:35:45,433
Some girl called for you.

1192
01:35:45,610 --> 01:35:50,235
Said you'd know who it was,
said she'd meet you at this bar.

1193
01:35:51,114 --> 01:35:55,407
Like, as if you're gonna rush
right over there. Right.

1194
01:35:55,576 --> 01:36:00,996
Totally unbelievable Southern accent.
An actress, I'll bet.

1195
01:36:31,815 --> 01:36:35,598
- Hi. Can I help you?
- I'm supposed to meet someone, a girl.

1196
01:36:36,277 --> 01:36:38,234
Ben.

1197
01:36:45,618 --> 01:36:47,776
Nancy Lee?

1198
01:36:52,290 --> 01:36:58,125
Well, I had to give it a shot, you know.
I just thought, just in case.

1199
01:36:58,629 --> 01:37:00,289
Guess not.

1200
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:03,832
You...

1201
01:37:04,592 --> 01:37:07,297
You drove all this way
just to bring me my car?

1202
01:37:07,470 --> 01:37:08,798
Sort of.

1203
01:37:08,971 --> 01:37:12,174
Well, I mean, it gave me an excuse
to get the hell out of Grady.

1204
01:37:12,349 --> 01:37:14,886
Pardon my French.
Things were bad before...

1205
01:37:15,059 --> 01:37:18,392
...but since you left,
they got positively stagnant.

1206
01:37:21,815 --> 01:37:25,065
- How's Hogue?
- Well, he's the same.

1207
01:37:27,737 --> 01:37:30,654
- Melvin?
- Same.

1208
01:37:31,448 --> 01:37:32,776
How's your dad?

1209
01:37:34,242 --> 01:37:36,780
Why don't you ask me about Vialula?

1210
01:37:37,787 --> 01:37:41,949
What's there to ask, really?
I guess she and Hank are...

1211
01:37:42,124 --> 01:37:43,783
You're in my chair.

1212
01:37:45,710 --> 01:37:47,868
Slide a bit, Nancy Lee.

1213
01:37:50,631 --> 01:37:55,422
There's a man in the toilet selling
aftershave. Now, what's that all about?

1214
01:37:56,594 --> 01:37:58,088
Hank.

1215
01:37:59,930 --> 01:38:01,721
What are you doing here?

1216
01:38:01,890 --> 01:38:05,140
Took my own advice, doc.
Knowing when to stay, when to get out.

1217
01:38:06,102 --> 01:38:08,972
I thought you and Lou
were gonna get...

1218
01:38:09,146 --> 01:38:13,392
Lou was never gonna marry me.
So I broke it off, clean.

1219
01:38:14,901 --> 01:38:16,977
You dumped her?

1220
01:38:17,153 --> 01:38:19,359
A man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do...

1221
01:38:19,530 --> 01:38:23,609
...even if it's in California.
Sense of higher purpose, you know?

1222
01:38:25,743 --> 01:38:27,652
Is that a star?

1223
01:38:27,828 --> 01:38:30,533
No, that's Ted Danson.

1224
01:38:42,674 --> 01:38:45,247
I'm going for breakfast.
You want anything?

1225
01:38:45,426 --> 01:38:47,751
How about Bob Barker?

1226
01:38:47,929 --> 01:38:50,336
I'll see what I can do.

1227
01:38:59,313 --> 01:39:01,352
Howdy.

1228
01:39:05,818 --> 01:39:07,941
You steal that pig?

1229
01:39:08,863 --> 01:39:12,112
I heard she was wasting away
in this one-pig town, so...

1230
01:39:12,282 --> 01:39:14,571
And you thought you'd come back
and rescue her.

1231
01:39:15,076 --> 01:39:17,745
Yeah. Something like that.

1232
01:39:18,496 --> 01:39:20,903
What makes you think
she'll take you back?

1233
01:39:23,041 --> 01:39:24,619
Because I love her.

1234
01:39:28,421 --> 01:39:30,994
Go back to Los Angeles.

1235
01:39:31,924 --> 01:39:34,628
I don't want Los Angeles.

1236
01:39:34,926 --> 01:39:36,835
I want you.

1237
01:39:46,561 --> 01:39:49,051
You got great tonsils.

1238
01:39:52,566 --> 01:39:54,439
That ain't all.

1239
01:39:56,152 --> 01:39:59,355
I just thought of something.
I can collect that $ 10 from Nicholson.

1240
01:39:59,530 --> 01:40:01,403
- You lost that bet.
- I did not.

1241
01:40:01,573 --> 01:40:03,067
- Who says?
- Me.

1242
01:40:03,241 --> 01:40:08,116
- You have no say. You are the bet.
- The bet was for one week. You lost.

1243
01:40:08,287 --> 01:40:09,781
It's your word against mine.

1244
01:40:09,955 --> 01:40:13,324
You would sully my reputation
for 10 measly dollars?

1245
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:17,283
Absolutely. I don't even know
what "sully" means.
