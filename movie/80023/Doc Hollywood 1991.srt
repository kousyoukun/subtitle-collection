1
00:00:22,348 --> 00:00:23,868
- Coming through!

2
00:00:26,018 --> 00:00:28,013
- Don't touch me! 
- Keep your hands off me!

3
00:00:31,838 --> 00:00:34,032
- I'll be with you in a moment.
- Don't walk away.

4
00:00:34,196 --> 00:00:36,073
- Doctor, I can't feel my arm.
- Just a minute.

5
00:00:37,797 --> 00:00:39,469
- Doctor, I can't feel my arm.

6
00:00:39,476 --> 00:00:41,910
I can't feel your arm right now either. 
Can someone feel his arm?

7
00:00:47,397 --> 00:00:48,749
- Don't touch my hair.

8
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:50,714
- Kiss the boo-boo. Kiss the boo-boo.

9
00:00:50,877 --> 00:00:53,868
- Hey, you're still here.
- Yeah, I'm still here. Can you believe it?

10
00:00:54,036 --> 00:00:57,710
Oh, hey, save me some coffee, 
you savage.

11
00:00:59,717 --> 00:01:01,546
What is this,
Alfred Hitchcock Presents?

12
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:08,627
- What's the problem?
- Gunshot wounds. Shoulder and abdomen.

13
00:01:08,794 --> 00:01:11,229
We've been paging you for five minutes.
You on California time already?

14
00:01:11,396 --> 00:01:13,987
- I was in Radiology working on my tan.
- Pulse, 120.

15
00:01:14,154 --> 00:01:16,145
Get this guy typed and crossed, huh?

16
00:01:16,594 --> 00:01:20,382
Okay, question: Beverly Hills, the most 
beautiful women in the world, plastic surgery.

17
00:01:20,554 --> 00:01:23,051
What do these three things
have in common? Huh?

18
00:01:23,059 --> 00:01:24,787
Me, in less than a week.

19
00:01:25,554 --> 00:01:28,863
Okay, don't worry about his shoulder.
This guy is probably bleeding internally.

20
00:01:29,033 --> 00:01:32,070
Call Dr. Sotto, tell him to prep for O.R.
cuz I'm out of here tonight.

21
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:35,620
Convince me I'll be nostalgic for here
when I'm at the Halberstrom Clinic.

22
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:37,828
- You're going to Halberstrom?
- Cosmetic surgery for the rich.

23
00:01:37,993 --> 00:01:41,462
- I'm not in it for the money.
- Half a million salary when he's partner.

24
00:01:41,633 --> 00:01:45,784
That high-profit stuff makes it possible
for us to do reconstructive surgery...

25
00:01:45,953 --> 00:01:48,067
...on the needier patients.
- You're a saint.

26
00:01:48,232 --> 00:01:49,410
- Got another customer over there.

27
00:01:49,418 --> 00:01:52,262
Alright, get out of here. I'll cover it. 
My going-away present to you.

28
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,502
- What's the problem?
- Too much fun. Substance unknown.

29
00:01:55,671 --> 00:01:58,900
Okay, stay with us. Stay with us.
What'd you take, man, huh?

30
00:01:58,908 --> 00:02:00,486
Bluebirds, dillies, love boats?

31
00:02:00,494 --> 00:02:04,142
I heard Halberstrom might not
even hire anyone this year.

32
00:02:04,311 --> 00:02:05,503
Well, I'm not anyone.

33
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,664
Mulready, some of the guys are having a 
bash for me tonight, a going away party.

34
00:02:08,672 --> 00:02:10,040
You know, if you're interested in it, 
I'd love for you ...

35
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,662
- Not in this lifetime.

36
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,418
- Clean up.
- Thanks.

37
00:02:18,589 --> 00:02:21,500
Come on, what do you say, guys?
Dinner. Think about it.

38
00:02:21,668 --> 00:02:24,740
Come on, it's my last night.
A couple of lousy beers?

39
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:27,103
- Take care, man.

40
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:32,575
I'll send you a postcard.

41
00:02:33,428 --> 00:02:35,065
What?

42
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:38,346
At the risk of sounding schmaltzy,
I just wanna tell you, that uh ...

43
00:02:38,506 --> 00:02:41,020
.. that you're a schmuck.
I hope I never see you again.

44
00:02:41,226 --> 00:02:42,368
Thanks, Tommy. 

45
00:02:42,376 --> 00:02:44,343
I know how hard it was 
for you to say that.

46
00:02:44,506 --> 00:02:46,060
You're a good doctor, Ben.

47
00:02:46,068 --> 00:02:48,784
I just thought you were 
gonna practice real medicine.

48
00:02:50,226 --> 00:02:53,184
Think I'm making a mistake
going to Halberstrom?

49
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:57,616
Nah! 
Cosmetic surgery is clean.

50
00:02:57,786 --> 00:03:01,094
You make tons of money,
nobody dies.

51
00:03:01,506 --> 00:03:03,098
What's wrong with that, right?

52
00:03:03,265 --> 00:03:04,778
Right.

53
00:03:05,106 --> 00:03:06,776
Bye, Ben.

Accident. Woman in the middle
of the road with a cow!

00:06:46,846 --> 00:06:48,915
All right. I'm okay.

Damn, my car.
Oh, man, the whole front end is shot!

Am I glad you're here.

Is that a '56 or a '57 Speedster?

Fifty-six.

97

Hey, come on, get out, get out!
Will you get out of the car!

98
00:07:07,525 --> 00:07:08,799
Get away from there.

99
00:07:08,965 --> 00:07:11,525
- Took me three weeks to build that fence.
- I'm sorry.

100
00:07:11,686 --> 00:07:14,199
Does this have a Super 90 engine
or a 1600?

101
00:07:14,366 --> 00:07:16,354
The way I look at it, it wasn't 
really anybody's fault.

102
00:07:16,524 --> 00:07:18,799
My insurance will probably pay
for the entire fence...

103
00:07:18,964 --> 00:07:20,635
...and that should be fine. Okay?

104
00:07:20,804 --> 00:07:23,034
- Won't be the same.
- This ain't a kit car, is it?

105
00:07:23,204 --> 00:07:25,114
No, it ain't. It isn't.

106
00:07:25,683 --> 00:07:28,640
My name is Ben Stone.

107
00:07:28,843 --> 00:07:30,992
I'm a doctor, a medical doctor.
I'm a surgeon.

108
00:07:31,162 --> 00:07:32,801
Awesome. Who thrashed the fence?

109
00:07:32,963 --> 00:07:35,395
I'm Ben Stone. Here's the address
of my clinic in L.A.

110
00:07:35,561 --> 00:07:38,157
- Did he say he's been stoned?
- He says he's from L.A.

111
00:07:38,323 --> 00:07:40,517
You can send a bill there
or we can use plastic.

112
00:07:40,682 --> 00:07:42,877
I'm not really from L.A.
I'm just on my way to...

113
00:07:43,042 --> 00:07:47,320
- You're lucky I was passing through.
- What's in the trunk? Pot?

114
00:07:48,641 --> 00:07:52,316
I'm a surgeon. Come on, will you
get away! Get away from the car!

115
00:07:52,481 --> 00:07:53,994
- Sorry.
- Not you, the dog.

116
00:07:54,161 --> 00:07:55,752
The finest fence I'll ever put up.

117
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,639
I know a Willie Stone in Stanton.
Is that family of yours?

118
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,632
- I understand what you're trying to do.
- Hey, is this the new Mazda?

119
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,473
And I'm not putting up
with any small-town bullshit.

120
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,790
Hey! Where's the dang engine?

121
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,999
Get away from this car! You don't
even know where the engine is.

122
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,276
Got cha.

123
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:17,872
Look, I'm sorry
about what happened...

124
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:21,748
...but it was an accident, okay?
It was nobody's fault.

125
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,114
Get me to a phone. I'll call
a Porsche mechanic in the next big city.

126
00:08:25,278 --> 00:08:29,237
I'll get my car fixed, be on my way,
and you can go back to doing...you know,

127
00:08:29,398 --> 00:08:30,797
...whatever it is you do.

128
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,629
All right, I admit it!
I flattened the damn fence!

129
00:08:36,796 --> 00:08:39,007
What are you gonna do, lock me up?

130
00:08:43,636 --> 00:08:47,868
Court finds the defendant guilty of 
crimes under motor vehicle code 453-19...

131
00:08:48,037 --> 00:08:51,109
...reckless driving, and 466-2,
reckless endangerment.

132
00:08:51,276 --> 00:08:53,710
- This is insane.
- No, this is Grady.

133
00:08:53,876 --> 00:08:57,346
Your Honor, there were cows
in the middle of the road.

134
00:08:57,516 --> 00:09:01,110
Now, I told you my insurance company
would be happy, to pay for a new fence.

135
00:09:01,276 --> 00:09:03,310
I built that fence myself.

136
00:09:03,475 --> 00:09:06,864
Neither you nor your insurance can
pay me for a fence I built myself.

137
00:09:06,872 --> 00:09:09,390
Can't be done. Next best thing 
would be a fence that you built.

138
00:09:09,554 --> 00:09:13,467
- These hands are delicate instruments.
- I doubt you could build a good fence, anyway.

139
00:09:13,635 --> 00:09:15,749
Therefore, since you're
a licensed physician ...

140
00:09:15,914 --> 00:09:18,508
and we are a town in acute 
shortage of medical care ...

141
00:09:18,674 --> 00:09:21,632
- Oh, you wouldn't.
... your sentence will be 16 hours ...

142
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:23,227
...of community service ...

143
00:09:23,394 --> 00:09:26,226
...served as resident doctor
at Grady Memorial Hospital.

144
00:09:26,393 --> 00:09:29,227
Alright, look, I have to be in Los Angeles
by Tuesday, so I don't...

145
00:09:29,394 --> 00:09:31,304
Thirty-two hours.

146
00:09:31,472 --> 00:09:34,384
- This is extortion!
- You want 64 hours?

147
00:09:35,672 --> 00:09:36,867
No.

148
00:09:37,752 --> 00:09:39,185
Court is adjourned.

149
00:09:39,353 --> 00:09:40,911
All rise.

150
00:09:41,591 --> 00:09:43,980
- I am so fucked.
- Watch your language, doc.

151
00:09:44,153 --> 00:09:49,146
You're in the buckle of the Bible belt here. 
Might try saying "fudge" or something.

152
00:09:49,431 --> 00:09:51,821
- "Fiddlesticks" too strong?
- Depends.

153
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,187
Don't you worry
about your automobile, doc.

154
00:09:54,351 --> 00:09:57,946
I always wanted an excuse
to buy me a set of metric tools.

155
00:09:58,112 --> 00:10:01,068
Sh... Sugar.

156
00:10:24,308 --> 00:10:25,788
Hey.

157
00:10:27,747 --> 00:10:29,227
I'm Dr. Benjamin Stone.

158
00:10:29,388 --> 00:10:33,016
Nurse Packer. I'm assuming
Judge Evans told you.

159
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,664
Fine. Here's what I need.

160
00:10:36,827 --> 00:10:40,820
Comfortable bed, hot shower,
warm meal, locker to put my stuff in...

161
00:10:40,988 --> 00:10:43,625
Could you show me some kind
of identification, please?

162
00:10:51,506 --> 00:10:54,736
I'm wearing glasses there.
I wear contacts now.

163
00:10:55,426 --> 00:10:57,576
My hair's a little shorter.

164
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:04,334
That's a moustache.
It's a bad picture.

165
00:11:04,505 --> 00:11:07,940
If you could direct me to the physician
on call tonight, I'll speak to him.

166
00:11:10,865 --> 00:11:12,264
"When to call me:

167
00:11:12,425 --> 00:11:16,338
If you've been stabbed, shot, poisoned,
separated from an appendage...

168
00:11:16,504 --> 00:11:19,541
...knocked or beaten unconscious,
run over by a tractor mower...

169
00:11:19,704 --> 00:11:22,901
...or generally about to bleed to death.
Otherwise, leave me alone."

170
00:11:23,063 --> 00:11:27,341
Signed,
Dr. Aurelius Edsel Hogue, M.D.

171
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:32,018
I'm in The Twilight Zone.

172
00:11:34,262 --> 00:11:37,618
Zwieback and vitamin C
in the upper cabinet if you're hungry.

173
00:11:37,783 --> 00:11:41,297
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
This is the best you can do?

174
00:11:41,542 --> 00:11:43,134
No.

175
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,848
Oh, good, you're awake. Welcome
to Grady. I'm Mayor Nicholson.

176
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,329
The second I heard
a big-city doctor was in town...

177
00:12:04,499 --> 00:12:07,297
...I left that rehearsal,
hightailed it over here...

178
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,655
...see if I can make you
more comfortable.

179
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:11,936
- We can do better than this.
- Better than this?

180
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:14,010
Say, these your duffles?

181
00:12:14,658 --> 00:12:18,571
I'm not claiming that Grady's no Paris,
France, but we got two gas stations...

182
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:21,377
...got us a Winn-Dixie, got us cable TV.
Like tennis?

183
00:12:21,538 --> 00:12:25,134
We got a new tennis court at the high
school. You doctors play golf, though.

184
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:27,813
- Learning how to surf, actually.
- Isn't this pretty?

185
00:12:27,978 --> 00:12:31,334
We had this fixed up for a doctor
we got through the want ads years ago.

186
00:12:31,497 --> 00:12:33,966
- No one's been in it for a while.
- Mayor Nicholson.

187
00:12:34,137 --> 00:12:37,447
I'm on my way to California.
Don't be thinking I'm staying here.

188
00:12:37,616 --> 00:12:39,893
No, no, of course not.

189
00:12:40,058 --> 00:12:42,366
Well, maybe not.
Give old Grady a chance...

190
00:12:42,536 --> 00:12:44,971
...she might sneak up on you
like a bee in a bottle.

191
00:12:49,456 --> 00:12:50,729
Surprise!

192
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:53,250
- Welcoming committee.
- I hope you're hungry.

193
00:12:54,335 --> 00:12:55,736
Evening, ladies.

194
00:12:55,897 --> 00:12:59,570
Ben Stone, this here is Miss Violet
and Miss Lillian and Miss Maddie.

195
00:12:59,735 --> 00:13:02,932
Ladies, this here is Ben Stone, M.D.

196
00:13:03,095 --> 00:13:06,883
Fried chicken, boiled peanuts
and sweet potato pie.

197
00:13:07,055 --> 00:13:11,411
Catfish, biscuits, butter beans
and watermelon.

198
00:13:11,575 --> 00:13:14,566
Hungry-Man dinner. I'm a bad cook.

199
00:13:14,735 --> 00:13:18,727
Well, I guess I'll just say adieu
and come chauffeur you in the morning.

200
00:13:18,894 --> 00:13:20,804
No, wait, wait, wait. Come on.

201
00:13:20,974 --> 00:13:22,452
You can't leave me here...

202
00:13:22,613 --> 00:13:25,252
...in the middle of nowhere with them.
It's getting late.

203
00:13:25,412 --> 00:13:29,008
Don't worry. Only one of them horny.
I'm not telling you which one, though.

204
00:13:29,173 --> 00:13:31,163
Your face.

205
00:13:37,612 --> 00:13:39,921
You want a cocktail?

206
00:13:40,693 --> 00:13:44,923
So anyway, the high-profile,
high-profit work...

207
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:48,002
...just makes it possible for me
to do the more important...

208
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:51,719
...reconstructive surgery
for needier patients.

209
00:13:52,611 --> 00:13:54,886
And get a big house on the beach.

210
00:13:55,051 --> 00:13:59,442
It's hard to believe. A man as good-
looking as Dr. Stone should be married.

211
00:13:59,611 --> 00:14:01,647
Maybe he ain't found
his Adam's rib yet.

212
00:14:01,811 --> 00:14:05,644
Maybe he indulges in the love
that dare not speak its name.

213
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:08,199
- Lillian.
- Will I go blind?

214
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:12,567
- It's moonshine, right?
- Well, ouzo, actually.

215
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:15,960
- We took a cruise to Greece.
- Not me. I wasn't invited.

216
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:18,848
It was one of those
golden-agers tours.

217
00:14:19,009 --> 00:14:20,920
Sunset Tours, honey.

218
00:14:21,088 --> 00:14:23,922
- They ate the brains out of a goat.
- Not me.

219
00:14:24,088 --> 00:14:26,318
- We ate dog.
- I didn't eat no dog.

220
00:14:26,487 --> 00:14:29,287
You don't know that you didn't.

221
00:14:29,608 --> 00:14:32,997
Dr. Stone, there's a legend
about friendship quilts.

222
00:14:33,168 --> 00:14:34,726
That's bunk.

223
00:14:34,888 --> 00:14:39,403
Folks say that the first person
to sleep under a friendship quilt...

224
00:14:39,567 --> 00:14:42,160
...will meet the one
they're gonna marry.

225
00:14:42,327 --> 00:14:45,319
Dream about the one they're
gonna marry, and it's bunk.

226
00:14:45,487 --> 00:14:48,559
What a fine hand he has.

227
00:14:49,406 --> 00:14:51,203
Dr. Stone?

228
00:14:52,206 --> 00:14:53,879
Dr. Stone?

229
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,006
[ music peaceful ]

230
00:16:04,599 --> 00:16:06,716
Oh, God.

231
00:16:28,437 --> 00:16:30,029
Hello.

232
00:16:31,797 --> 00:16:33,072
Hi.

233
00:16:33,878 --> 00:16:36,517
- Good morning.
- Is something wrong?

234
00:16:36,678 --> 00:16:38,871
No, no, no.

235
00:16:39,717 --> 00:16:41,355
I'm a doctor.

236
00:16:41,517 --> 00:16:43,904
Yeah, I know who you are.

237
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:49,914
Hey, I'm sorry. Would you...?
Do you want this?

238
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:53,910
If you're a doctor, I don't have
anything you haven't seen before.

239
00:17:04,036 --> 00:17:06,185
You can blink now.

240
00:17:10,595 --> 00:17:13,950
All the boys from the state legislature
come here, do their recreating.

241
00:17:14,114 --> 00:17:17,423
Boy, can they litter. Presidents
come here during the fishing season.

242
00:17:17,594 --> 00:17:19,506
On purpose?

243
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:22,990
One look at all this, Ben boy,
I'm sure you're saying to yourself:

244
00:17:23,153 --> 00:17:26,271
"I have come to Grady at the most
beautiful time of the year."

245
00:17:26,433 --> 00:17:29,469
But, boy, these dogwoods, azaleas,
when they blooming...

246
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:33,307
...they can't hold a candle to the nuclear
explosion of color come fall.

247
00:17:33,473 --> 00:17:37,385
Look, Nick, you're the mayor. You have
the authority to commute my sentence.

248
00:17:37,552 --> 00:17:39,066
Could you do that?

249
00:17:39,232 --> 00:17:42,144
Look, I'll make it worth your while, alright?
I'll get back to L.A., maybe we could work ...

250
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:44,950
Why on earth
would I wanna do that?

251
00:17:45,111 --> 00:17:48,467
How am I gonna convince you
to stay here if you're not here?

252
00:17:49,191 --> 00:17:52,740
We need a doctor, you need patients.

253
00:17:52,951 --> 00:17:57,024
Get off the interstate, Ben Stone.

254
00:17:57,512 --> 00:17:59,023
Right?

255
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:05,306
Don't let the signs of prosperity and
urban sprawl in downtown scare you.

256
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:07,539
We're still the same
sleepy little paradise...

257
00:18:07,709 --> 00:18:10,940
...that big-city shrinks recommend
for patients with nervous disorders.

258
00:18:11,108 --> 00:18:13,418
It's the calming effect
of Grady's natural ozone.

259
00:18:13,591 --> 00:18:16,182
Fact, there's a world-class
mental hospital up the road.

260
00:18:16,349 --> 00:18:17,623
That's a comforting thought.

261
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:21,464
Ben Stone, do you like coffee?
If you like coffee, we won't go in here.

262
00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:24,740
- Is that him?
- That's him.

263
00:18:24,908 --> 00:18:28,059
- He's young, huh?
- Come on, let's go.

264
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:33,024
Boys, this here is Ben Stone...

265
00:18:33,188 --> 00:18:36,181
...a Hollywood physician
who's gonna spend a few days with us.

266
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:40,421
Ben, this is Mortimer, John, Aubrey.
Probably don't want to shake his hand.

267
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:43,464
Sorty in the corner.
Sorty got a cow that sings.

268
00:18:43,627 --> 00:18:47,063
- You remember Cotton, Miss Lillian.
- Hollywood. La-la land.

269
00:18:47,386 --> 00:18:48,978
- Beverly Hills, actually.
- Whatever.

270
00:18:49,146 --> 00:18:52,854
- Well, William's been a movie star.
- It was just an Army training film.

271
00:18:53,026 --> 00:18:55,586
Come now, you were the star.
You played the lead role.

272
00:18:55,746 --> 00:18:59,738
It was about VD. I was the bacteria.
Had a big scene with penicillin.

273
00:19:00,144 --> 00:19:02,420
Yes, a death scene.

274
00:19:02,586 --> 00:19:05,179
Take a load off, doctor.
This will stop your worries.

275
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:07,176
Or start them.

276
00:19:08,584 --> 00:19:10,223
So, what do you think of our town?

277
00:19:10,385 --> 00:19:12,852
- I haven't seen all of it yet.
- Yeah, you have.

278
00:19:13,985 --> 00:19:15,304
Opportunity abounds here.

279
00:19:15,463 --> 00:19:17,694
Growth rate was up. 3 percent
last year.

280
00:19:17,864 --> 00:19:20,695
- There's no crime.
- By the way, we are the county seat.

281
00:19:20,863 --> 00:19:24,651
Fellas, no point in beating a dead horse
to death. That's all in the brochure.

282
00:19:24,823 --> 00:19:29,055
Ben Stone, we are prepared
to offer you a permanent position...

283
00:19:29,223 --> 00:19:32,579
...as medical practitioner supreme
in the Grady metropolitan area...

284
00:19:32,744 --> 00:19:34,891
...the squash capital of the South.

285
00:19:35,061 --> 00:19:38,100
The salary's $27,000 per annum,
and plus housing.

286
00:19:39,063 --> 00:19:40,620
Twenty-seven thousand?

287
00:19:40,783 --> 00:19:44,251
- You see, Nick, I told you...
- Hold on. Thirty thousand.

288
00:19:45,141 --> 00:19:47,781
Look, you people don't even know me.

289
00:19:47,941 --> 00:19:50,500
I noticed right off that he
double-knots his shoelaces.

290
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,175
- Excellent credentials.
- Shows he's careful.

291
00:19:53,582 --> 00:19:55,617
Anyway, don't you already have
a doctor?

292
00:19:55,781 --> 00:19:57,611
We got Hogue.
The problem with Hogue is...

293
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,170
- He's old.
- Old and wholly unpleasant.

294
00:20:00,341 --> 00:20:02,410
Point is, he's not going
to be around forever.

295
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:03,894
Thirty-five thousand?

296
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:07,019
But that would take a unanimous vote
of the whole city council.

297
00:20:07,181 --> 00:20:09,135
- All in favor say, "Aye."
- Aye.

298
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,575
- I abstain.
- You always abstain.

299
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:15,573
Look, I appreciate your problem...

300
00:20:15,739 --> 00:20:17,695
...but I'm not the answer.

301
00:20:17,859 --> 00:20:20,135
I got a big job interview
on the West Coast.

302
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:23,813
It's very important I get there in the
next couple of days. Plastic surgery.

303
00:20:23,978 --> 00:20:28,017
The truth is, they can probably pay me
about 20 times what you can afford.

304
00:20:28,177 --> 00:20:30,976
There's a lot of similarities
between Grady and Los Angeles.

305
00:20:31,139 --> 00:20:32,695
They're just bigger, is all.

306
00:20:33,537 --> 00:20:35,210
- What do I owe you?
- Ten bucks.

307
00:20:35,378 --> 00:20:37,938
- Ten bucks for coffee and toast?
- Got cha.

308
00:20:38,098 --> 00:20:40,735
Tell you what, why don't you wait
to make up your mind...

309
00:20:40,897 --> 00:20:42,727
...till after the squash festival, huh?

310
00:20:42,897 --> 00:20:47,128
All I'm saying, Ben Stone, is give Grady
a chance. I bet you'll like her.

311
00:20:48,657 --> 00:20:52,615
Yeah, well, nice meeting you all.

312
00:20:52,775 --> 00:20:54,449
Thanks.

313
00:21:03,455 --> 00:21:06,527
- Howdy, nurse. How you doing?
- Doctor's lounge is down the hall.

314
00:21:06,695 --> 00:21:11,484
You can change in there, then Lou will
show you around. This is your time card.

315
00:21:13,055 --> 00:21:15,523
You gotta be kidding.

316
00:21:22,813 --> 00:21:26,282
- Local call?
- I don't know anybody local.

317
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:29,167
Pay phone's in the waiting room.

318
00:21:31,492 --> 00:21:36,806
Yeah, it's... No, it's a collect call
from Dr. Benjamin Stone.

319
00:21:36,973 --> 00:21:38,610
Stone.

320
00:21:38,772 --> 00:21:40,411
Come on, do you mind?
This is a...

321
00:21:41,532 --> 00:21:44,808
...personal call.
- I guess so.

322
00:21:47,091 --> 00:21:51,608
Yeah, hi. Yes, this is Dr. Stone.
Actually, that's why I'm calling.

323
00:21:51,771 --> 00:21:54,330
I don't think I'm gonna be able
to make it on Tuesday.

324
00:21:54,491 --> 00:21:57,004
I just... There was a...

325
00:21:58,491 --> 00:22:00,766
A medical emergency in...

326
00:22:00,929 --> 00:22:03,808
They don't have a doctor,
so I volunteered my services.

327
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:07,087
I'll need to stay
until the situation stabilizes.

328
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,841
Yeah, medically speaking.

329
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:12,084
You're interviewing other doctors?
Friday?

330
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:16,720
Yeah, okay, Friday. I can do that. No,
thank you very much. And thank Doctor...

331
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:21,843
That was better tap-dancing
than I've seen on Star Search.

332
00:22:23,888 --> 00:22:27,357
If you tell me you're here for
a physical, you're gonna make my day.

333
00:22:27,528 --> 00:22:30,168
It's unprofessional to flirt
with the patients.

334
00:22:30,328 --> 00:22:34,321
I'm just on my way to Beverly Hills.
Plastic surgery.

335
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:36,240
Not that you need any.

336
00:22:36,408 --> 00:22:38,204
Nice try.

337
00:22:38,366 --> 00:22:41,916
So is this the GQ look
for young urban doctors?

338
00:22:42,926 --> 00:22:46,282
Well, I've spent the last two years
doing 18-hour days in the ER.

339
00:22:46,446 --> 00:22:49,722
I find these are pretty comfortable.

340
00:22:50,127 --> 00:22:51,957
You don't like them?

341
00:22:52,206 --> 00:22:53,764
No.

342
00:22:55,646 --> 00:22:59,082
Okay, fine. Well, I really enjoyed
our time together here...

343
00:22:59,246 --> 00:23:03,125
...but since you're obviously not a
patient, and I'm not getting anywhere...

344
00:23:03,285 --> 00:23:06,879
...tell me where I can find a guy named
Lou, drives an ambulance?

345
00:23:07,044 --> 00:23:08,717
I'm Lou.

346
00:23:17,803 --> 00:23:19,601
Where did all these people come from?

347
00:23:19,764 --> 00:23:22,880
Folks hear there's a doctor on duty,
they come running.

348
00:23:23,044 --> 00:23:25,433
Any old doctor.

349
00:23:28,123 --> 00:23:29,953
Send them in.

350
00:23:30,604 --> 00:23:33,640
Okay, Mr. Tidwell.

351
00:23:33,803 --> 00:23:36,236
What the hell have you got
on your foot?

352
00:23:36,402 --> 00:23:37,916
That's a poultice.

353
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:41,835
- Nurse Packer!
- I got ahold to Doc Hogue on the CB...

354
00:23:42,002 --> 00:23:44,469
...and he said that that will hold me
till I came in.

355
00:23:44,642 --> 00:23:46,040
- You did this on purpose?
- Yes.

356
00:23:46,202 --> 00:23:49,274
It's chimney soot, biscuit flour
and lard. Doc Hogue said...

357
00:23:49,442 --> 00:23:54,561
Wipe that crap off Mr. Tidwell's foot,
please, and clean that wound out.

358
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,916
- You allergic to penicillin?
- Don't know. Ask Doc Hogue.

359
00:24:00,081 --> 00:24:03,117
Doubt Doc Hogue knows
it's even been discovered.

360
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,713
Okay. Nurse Packer,
I'm gonna wash this with Betadine...

361
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,918
...close it with a butterfly,
give it a sterile dressing.

362
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:14,799
You sure you ought to be doing that
so darned fast?

363
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:16,995
I hope so, Mr. Tidwell...

364
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:19,115
...because je suis fini.

365
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,058
Olay!

366
00:24:23,838 --> 00:24:26,990
Okay, Mrs. Owens, if you could
please get up on the table...

367
00:24:27,157 --> 00:24:28,672
...put your feet in the stirrups.

368
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:37,912
We're just here about our mail.

369
00:24:38,397 --> 00:24:42,025
It's from my sister. We don't read.

370
00:24:44,676 --> 00:24:48,669
- This ever happen before, Mr. McClary?
- Hell, yes. It happens.

371
00:24:48,836 --> 00:24:51,146
This ain't nearly the biggest one
I ever took.

372
00:24:51,316 --> 00:24:55,275
I had a hook in my thigh once.
It must have been, I'd say, like...

373
00:24:55,435 --> 00:24:57,586
Oh, excuse me, I... Yeah, well...

374
00:24:57,755 --> 00:25:01,111
- Fishing's a dangerous business.
- Well, it can be.

375
00:25:01,275 --> 00:25:07,191
"And after the cow died, there just
wasn't any reason for him to go on.

376
00:25:07,754 --> 00:25:11,463
Meanwhile, Ellen's got herself
mixed up with a Pakistani gentleman...

377
00:25:11,633 --> 00:25:14,911
...who nobody can understand
what he is saying.

378
00:25:15,474 --> 00:25:17,431
Not even Ellen."

379
00:25:17,714 --> 00:25:20,148
I don't see any toxic striations.

380
00:25:20,313 --> 00:25:21,748
Red streaks.

381
00:25:21,914 --> 00:25:24,428
You sure it was a black widow?

382
00:25:24,593 --> 00:25:28,744
Here. I kept it in some T.P.

383
00:25:30,313 --> 00:25:32,507
Oh, dear Lord, it's escaped.

384
00:25:34,672 --> 00:25:36,550
- There it is.
- Wait, there he goes.

385
00:25:36,713 --> 00:25:39,464
- Here he goes. Here he goes.
- Step on it.

386
00:25:39,633 --> 00:25:42,385
"She thinks Ray's having an affair
with the pastor's wife...

387
00:25:42,551 --> 00:25:45,782
...but Ray swears
it's his scrub-up rash."

388
00:25:46,432 --> 00:25:49,423
Ray is a nut, I'm telling you.

389
00:25:49,672 --> 00:25:52,981
It's like a blurred spot
in my vision.

390
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:57,985
Out there. No. There. No.
No, there.

391
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:11,106
I'm cured.

392
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:15,623
"The pastor's wife got busted
for growing marijuana...

393
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,620
...out behind the rectory.

394
00:26:17,789 --> 00:26:22,943
So she'll be spending a spell up in Tupelo
at the minimum-security prison."

395
00:26:25,548 --> 00:26:27,584
That's it?

396
00:26:28,788 --> 00:26:31,428
What about Ellen and the Pakistani?

397
00:26:41,147 --> 00:26:43,216
Nurse Packer? Nurse Packer.

398
00:26:43,387 --> 00:26:47,140
Where's Doc Hogue? The boy can't
breathe right, and he's turning blue.

399
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:48,580
I'm the doctor here.

400
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:51,581
Nurse Packer,
you've got to call Doc Hogue.

401
00:26:52,145 --> 00:26:55,296
- Please.
- It's all right. I'm the doctor.

402
00:26:56,386 --> 00:26:58,660
- How long has he been like this?
- All afternoon.

403
00:26:58,824 --> 00:27:00,339
- What's his name?
- Zeb.

404
00:27:00,505 --> 00:27:03,144
Hey, Zeb, this is going to be
a little cold, all right?

405
00:27:03,306 --> 00:27:05,501
I just wanna hear your heart.

406
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,502
Does your tummy hurt?

407
00:27:09,145 --> 00:27:12,692
All right, take him down to the
examination room. I'll be right there.

408
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:15,503
You know where that is?
Right there, okay?

409
00:27:15,664 --> 00:27:18,224
Have Zeb get up on the table for me.

410
00:27:20,184 --> 00:27:22,903
- Call Hogue. Get him here.
- He doesn't like to be disturbed.

411
00:27:23,063 --> 00:27:25,975
I really don't care. Forget Hogue.
What's the referral hospital?

412
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,055
- Athens General.
- Call Athens General.

413
00:27:28,223 --> 00:27:31,374
We have a cardiac emergency.
Tell Lou to fire up the ambulance.

414
00:27:31,544 --> 00:27:34,340
No, forget it. They have a helicopter.
Tell them to send it.

415
00:27:34,503 --> 00:27:38,212
- Get me Zeb's medical history.
- I better call Dr. Hogue.

416
00:27:38,382 --> 00:27:41,852
Damn it. Listen to me,
Hogue is not here. I'm here.

417
00:27:42,022 --> 00:27:43,820
You do it.

418
00:27:50,622 --> 00:27:52,215
Here's the situation.

419
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:55,533
Your son is turning blue
because he has an abnormal mitral valve.

420
00:27:55,701 --> 00:27:58,977
It's causing a back flow of blood in
his heart. We may have to operate.

421
00:27:59,141 --> 00:28:00,699
We'll send him to Athens General.

422
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:03,454
Dr. Hogue said
you should give the boy a Coke.

423
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:08,136
He says he's probably got a bellyache
and that you should give him a Coke.

424
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,698
Listen, doctor, I've got a boy here
in cardiac crisis.

425
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:17,738
You can't treat that with Coca-Cola or
Bisquick. We have to use real medicine.

426
00:28:17,899 --> 00:28:20,617
I'm sending him to Athens General.
You're his doctor...

427
00:28:20,778 --> 00:28:23,656
...so get your fat ass out of bed
and go with him!

428
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:29,365
- How long will the chopper be?
- Should be here any minute.

429
00:28:42,017 --> 00:28:44,578
- Where's Stone?
- Dr. Hogue.

430
00:28:45,297 --> 00:28:48,811
What the hell kind of snot-nosed
puppy doctor are you anyway?

431
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:52,093
Wake me up, scare these folks out
of their skivvies.

432
00:28:52,256 --> 00:28:54,406
Mitral valve regurge.

433
00:28:54,576 --> 00:28:58,568
I've had a lot of experience with it in ER.
I've even assisted in surgery to correct.

434
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:02,488
God only knows how long he's had this,
but you overlooked it. Check his color.

435
00:29:02,655 --> 00:29:04,725
Nurse Packer,
get that crap off the boy.

436
00:29:05,135 --> 00:29:08,047
Gene, you gave him the
bismuth subnitrate, didn't you?

437
00:29:08,216 --> 00:29:10,933
- At first we thought...
- You gave him too much as usual.

438
00:29:11,935 --> 00:29:14,129
Turned him three shades of blue.

439
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:17,444
- Bismuth subnitrate?
- Homegrown antacid.

440
00:29:17,614 --> 00:29:19,843
You hear a heart murmur?

441
00:29:20,014 --> 00:29:21,605
No, it's hard to detect.

442
00:29:21,774 --> 00:29:24,652
You been sampling
your daddy's chaw?

443
00:29:31,534 --> 00:29:33,124
That will be 65 cents.

444
00:29:37,131 --> 00:29:39,725
Well, nice work, Hollywood.

445
00:29:39,892 --> 00:29:42,531
You were about to open
the chest of a 6-year-old boy...

446
00:29:42,691 --> 00:29:46,606
...to cure a case of diarrhea.
Now, listen up, smart-ass.

447
00:29:46,772 --> 00:29:49,206
Next time I tell you
how to treat a patient of mine...

448
00:29:49,372 --> 00:29:52,125
...you better damn well do it, doctor.

449
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:55,442
I doubt you'd know crap from Crisco.

450
00:30:05,451 --> 00:30:08,307
Hey. 
- Guten haben, Herr Doctor.

451
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:11,882
Yeah, right.

452
00:30:15,729 --> 00:30:18,641
Shit!

453
00:30:21,608 --> 00:30:24,282
Wait. Wait. Hold your horses, doc.

454
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:28,044
Now, what if I walked in in the middle
of a hernia operation...

455
00:30:28,209 --> 00:30:31,166
...see some poor gentleman's guts
all over?

456
00:30:31,448 --> 00:30:33,722
- You killed my car.
- I resent that.

457
00:30:33,888 --> 00:30:36,799
That car was my life, Melvin.
That car was my baby.

458
00:30:36,966 --> 00:30:39,764
You want me to stop now?
I can put it in some boxes...

459
00:30:39,926 --> 00:30:42,999
...ship it out to Hollywood for you.
No skin off my nose.

460
00:30:43,168 --> 00:30:45,043
You and me called it
an oil pump casing.

461
00:30:45,206 --> 00:30:48,005
Lane had two years of the German
language in high school.

462
00:30:51,326 --> 00:30:53,396
Doc, let's step into my office.

463
00:30:56,165 --> 00:30:58,964
I don't need a car.
I'm moving to Los Angeles.

464
00:30:59,126 --> 00:31:01,959
- What do I need a car for?
- Lash yourself to the mast.

465
00:31:02,127 --> 00:31:05,435
Fella up in Oregon has an oil pump
he could air-express to us tomorrow.

466
00:31:05,606 --> 00:31:09,563
Two hundred thirty-nine bucks,
plus shipping. Only one problem.

467
00:31:09,765 --> 00:31:12,039
Oregon exploded.

468
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,637
No.

469
00:31:14,165 --> 00:31:17,361
He don't take credit. Or checks.

470
00:31:17,525 --> 00:31:21,403
And tomorrow being Saturday,
you can't just wire some cash to him.

471
00:31:21,563 --> 00:31:24,362
Okay, Melvin, let me ask you this.

472
00:31:24,524 --> 00:31:27,878
How do you propose I pay for this?

473
00:31:28,043 --> 00:31:29,522
Well, I was hoping you'd pay me.

474
00:31:29,684 --> 00:31:33,722
Then I can trade him for a front rocker
assembly I got from a '68 Nova, but...

475
00:31:33,883 --> 00:31:37,557
- You don't take credit or checks.
- No, sir. I apologize.

476
00:31:37,723 --> 00:31:39,473
How long will this guy
in Oregon wait?

477
00:31:39,643 --> 00:31:42,474
I imagine I could stall him
till Sunday noon.

478
00:31:42,641 --> 00:31:47,032
Now, he got another taker in Arizona,
but I was first.

479
00:31:49,521 --> 00:31:51,193
Stall him.

480
00:31:55,401 --> 00:31:57,073
- Hi, doc.
- Hi, doc.

481
00:31:57,241 --> 00:32:00,630
- Morning, doc.
- Morning, Ben Stone.

482
00:32:00,802 --> 00:32:02,712
Howdy, y'all.

483
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,628
- Dr. Stone. Dr. Stone, I presume.
- Yeah, that's right.

484
00:32:11,801 --> 00:32:13,198
- Hi.
- Hi.

485
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:15,589
Say, you're much taller
than they said you were.

486
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:19,159
I'm sitting on a stool.

487
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:21,672
And you are?

488
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:24,875
Dying to get out of this town.
How about you?

489
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:27,155
- Here's your breakfast.
- I haven't ordered yet.

490
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,389
Compliments of the house.
Don't let old Hogue scare you off.

491
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:33,833
We know you weren't aiming
to kill that boy last night.

492
00:32:34,518 --> 00:32:37,111
Wait a minute, you're not planning
on staying in Grady?

493
00:32:37,276 --> 00:32:39,916
- Only as long as I have to.
- Thank God.

494
00:32:40,077 --> 00:32:42,717
For a second, I thought they got
their hooks into you too.

495
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:46,233
- Wait, you don't like Grady?
- No.

496
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:48,070
So how come you don't leave?

497
00:32:48,917 --> 00:32:50,236
With you?

498
00:32:51,796 --> 00:32:53,674
Is that a proposition, doctor?

499
00:32:54,956 --> 00:32:57,344
I better eat this before it's cold.
Nice meeting you.

500
00:32:57,515 --> 00:32:59,391
Thanks, Lillian.

501

"Prosser on Torts." "Civil Procedure."
A little light reading this morning?

502
00:33:09,995 --> 00:33:11,427
Did I invite you to sit down?

503
00:33:11,594 --> 00:33:14,632
No, but you were going to.
Southern hospitality and all.

504
00:33:15,594 --> 00:33:17,983
- Now what?
- Now let's talk about you.

505
00:33:18,153 --> 00:33:20,952
Okay. I like my privacy.
I'm a vegetarian.

506
00:33:21,115 --> 00:33:24,469
I'd appreciate it if you'd take that slab
of ham to the counter with you.

507
00:33:24,634 --> 00:33:27,706
- It gives me the willies.
- I didn't order this slab.

508
00:33:27,874 --> 00:33:31,786
Now I suppose you'll say something cute
to stall your retreat.

509
00:33:31,953 --> 00:33:33,590
Maybe tell me about the big city...

510
00:33:33,752 --> 00:33:36,392
...all the things I'm missing
living in this dinky town...

511
00:33:36,553 --> 00:33:39,624
...and how you'd like to be the one
to take me out of it.

512
00:33:41,832 --> 00:33:44,346
Isn't that why you're going
to law school?

513
00:33:44,512 --> 00:33:46,786
You want to get out
of this dinky little town.

514
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:51,303
I'm not going yet. And I plan to practice
in Grady when I'm through.

515
00:33:52,152 --> 00:33:54,712
Yeah, it looks like a hotbed
of legal activity.

516
00:33:54,871 --> 00:33:58,545
Well, malpractice for visiting young
surgeons seems promising.

517
00:33:58,951 --> 00:34:00,543
Who's the green apple, Vialula?

518
00:34:01,271 --> 00:34:03,625
- Henry, this is Ben Stone.
- Hey.

519
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:06,100
Oh, yeah, the new croaker.

520
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:07,702
Hank Gordon.

521
00:34:07,869 --> 00:34:09,144
You're in my chair.

522
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:12,825
- Boyfriend?
- "Friend" friend.

523
00:34:22,709 --> 00:34:25,303
- Need any life insurance?
- What?

524
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:28,586
You should be vested
in a term life program.

525
00:34:28,749 --> 00:34:31,022
Probably a quarter of a mil to start.

526
00:34:31,308 --> 00:34:33,775
Come by my office.
We could run a "what if."

527
00:34:34,068 --> 00:34:35,865
Or are you too chicken?

528
00:34:38,946 --> 00:34:41,781
I read somewhere doctors have
the highest suicide rate...

529
00:34:41,947 --> 00:34:43,857
...in any profession except dentistry.

530
00:34:44,026 --> 00:34:47,575
- Now, is that true?
- I won't underwrite dentists. Nope.

531
00:34:47,746 --> 00:34:50,738
Never trust a man who'll put his hand
in your mouth.

532
00:34:51,066 --> 00:34:54,217
Well, I'd love to stay and hear
where this conversation's headed...

533
00:34:54,385 --> 00:34:56,581
...but if you all will excuse me.

534
00:34:57,704 --> 00:35:00,778
There's something else
I wanted to ask you.

535
00:35:01,344 --> 00:35:05,896
Do doctors know more about sex
than normal people?

536
00:35:08,704 --> 00:35:11,265
I need some ketchup.

537
00:35:11,864 --> 00:35:14,298
I have a fair knowledge
of animal husbandry.

538
00:35:14,464 --> 00:35:16,615
It's all pretty much the same thing.

539
00:35:16,943 --> 00:35:18,297
- Bye, doc.
- Bye.

540
00:35:18,464 --> 00:35:20,931
Women trouble, Ben Stone?

541
00:35:21,584 --> 00:35:23,381
Squat here.

542
00:35:26,143 --> 00:35:29,215
- Regard the Grady squash.
- Looks like a yellow zucchini.

543
00:35:29,382 --> 00:35:34,059
Nope. See, up until 1933, you had your
Grady, you had your zucchini.

544
00:35:34,223 --> 00:35:35,974
They're going at it, gourd to gourd.

545
00:35:36,143 --> 00:35:39,531
Freak tornado accident wiped out
a whole shipment of Gradys...

546
00:35:39,702 --> 00:35:44,616
...bound for, I believe, agricultural
stardom at the Chicago World's Fair.

547
00:35:44,782 --> 00:35:46,897
The zucchini took there.
Never relented.

548
00:35:47,182 --> 00:35:51,014
If it had gone the other way, no telling
where this town would be today.

549
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,418
What are you talking about?

550
00:35:54,101 --> 00:35:56,899
Timing. Same thing with women.

551
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,973
And with Southern women,
they require substantial commitment.

552
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,699
You might have to stay here
for six months, maybe more.

553
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:06,409
- Are you a betting man, Nick?
- I have been known on occasion.

554
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,371
- Take me about a week.
- Now, wait a minute.

555
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:13,930
- You mean Vialula in the center pocket?
- Ten bucks.

556
00:36:16,098 --> 00:36:18,374
Okay, you got it.

557
00:36:19,499 --> 00:36:21,853
Feels like I'm fleecing you, Ben Stone.

558
00:36:24,618 --> 00:36:26,369
Easy.

559
00:36:29,178 --> 00:36:31,328
Hello, Nurse Packer.

560
00:36:33,978 --> 00:36:35,490
All right.

561
00:36:35,657 --> 00:36:38,171
Okay, let's get something straight
right now.

562
00:36:38,337 --> 00:36:42,933
I got eight years of higher education, one
year of internship, one year of residency.

563
00:36:43,097 --> 00:36:44,529
I'm $70,000 in debt.

564
00:36:44,697 --> 00:36:47,086
Now I'm waylaid in this heehaw hell...

565
00:36:47,257 --> 00:36:50,646
...and you insist on clocking me in
and out like I'm a factory worker.

566
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:54,491
Well, no! N-O, no!
This is where I draw the line.

567
00:36:55,697 --> 00:36:58,654
I believe you have a visitor, doctor.

568
00:37:01,936 --> 00:37:06,406
Doc, my foot feels so good,
I brought you this pig.

569
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:11,366
Okay.

570
00:37:11,535 --> 00:37:14,413
I can't abide being in no man's debt.

571
00:37:14,576 --> 00:37:16,849
This pig's all I got to give.

572
00:37:18,734 --> 00:37:21,487
I'm already paid, more or less,
by the hospital.

573
00:37:21,655 --> 00:37:25,363
- I really can't accept your pig.
- It's a done deal.

574
00:37:26,374 --> 00:37:28,489
She's your pig now.

575
00:37:29,613 --> 00:37:31,729
God bless you both.

576
00:37:37,453 --> 00:37:40,250
Keep your animal outside.
This is a hospital.

578
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:55,721
- Nice pig there, doc.
- Thank you.

579
00:37:55,892 --> 00:37:58,608
- Lovely pig.
- Thank you very much. Appreciate it.

580
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:02,001
- Nice pig, doc!
- Thank you.

00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:05,003
Thank you all very much.

They played last four years
in the Rose Parade.

585
00:38:21,808 --> 00:38:25,164
I got them under exclusive contract
to the Grady Squash Festival.

586
00:38:25,328 --> 00:38:26,727
I'm not staying.

587
00:38:27,129 --> 00:38:28,527
Sure, you aren't.

588
00:38:28,688 --> 00:38:31,679
Oh, by the way, dinner at my house
tomorrow night, 6:00.

589
00:38:31,887 --> 00:38:33,367
- Dinner?
- Didn't I tell you?

590
00:38:33,528 --> 00:38:34,802
You're guest of honor.

591
00:38:35,727 --> 00:38:39,117
Shoot a monkey. If my head wasn't
attached, I'd need wood screws.

592
00:38:39,288 --> 00:38:40,800
- Nice pig, doc.
- Thanks.

593
00:38:40,967 --> 00:38:43,084
Can I bring a date?

594
00:38:43,246 --> 00:38:45,806
Well, I don't know. Can you?

595
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:51,635
This is Ben Stone you're talking to.
Come on, pig.

596
00:38:53,086 --> 00:38:55,280
Fine pig, doc.

Melvin.

598
00:39:01,686 --> 00:39:04,836

00:39:05,044 --> 00:39:08,435
Hey, doc. We're just rehearsing
for the pageant.

Melvin, listen.

602
00:39:16,285 --> 00:39:20,561
I don't have the money
for the oil-gepumpkin-hausen thing.

603
00:39:22,683 --> 00:39:26,517
I mean, when I say I haven't got
the money, that's not entirely true.

604
00:39:26,683 --> 00:39:28,515
I have the money.
I'm good for the money.

605
00:39:28,683 --> 00:39:31,595
It's just a matter of accessing
the money in a period of time.

606
00:39:31,763 --> 00:39:34,401
Can we work something out, please?

607
00:39:34,562 --> 00:39:37,475
This car has got to be ready
by the time I leave.

608
00:39:40,722 --> 00:39:43,759
- That your pig?
- Yeah.

609
00:39:51,401 --> 00:39:55,314
You want to trade? Pig for the part?

610
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,152
If you can part with the pig.

611
00:40:01,121 --> 00:40:02,110
Good.

612
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,634
- Hi.
- Hi.

613
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,711
- You just pick those?
- Yes, ma'am.

614
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:21,795
They're protected by law.
State flowers.

615
00:40:24,279 --> 00:40:25,951
Figures.

616
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:30,476
I'm already serving time for the fence.
May as well take my chances, right?

617
00:40:30,638 --> 00:40:34,870
Mama. Mama, who is it?
Who are you?

618
00:40:38,157 --> 00:40:39,876
I'm Ben.

619
00:40:41,117 --> 00:40:43,551
Emma, take these inside
and put them in some water.

620
00:40:43,718 --> 00:40:46,106
You're not supposed to pick these.

621
00:40:46,436 --> 00:40:48,268
Use the plastic pitcher.

622
00:40:50,837 --> 00:40:52,747
Yeah, she's mine.

623
00:40:52,915 --> 00:40:55,590
She's 4. You wanna retreat now or...?

624
00:40:55,756 --> 00:40:57,314
No, no, no.

625
00:40:57,475 --> 00:41:00,149
No. Actually, I just came by...

626
00:41:00,315 --> 00:41:03,671
...because I need a date for dinner
tomorrow night.

627
00:41:03,835 --> 00:41:06,712
- Nick Nicholson's?
- Yeah. How'd you know?

628
00:41:07,035 --> 00:41:10,344
Can't poop in this town without
everyone knowing what color it is.

629
00:41:16,995 --> 00:41:20,270
I was fixing to have a cocktail.

630
00:41:20,475 --> 00:41:22,226
Are you in a hurry?

631
00:41:24,713 --> 00:41:26,704
Oh, man, that's tart.

632
00:41:26,874 --> 00:41:30,832
It's called a "Slow Comfortable Screw
Up Against a Wall," with a twist.

633
00:41:30,994 --> 00:41:33,905
- Is that a Grady specialty?
- No.

634
00:41:34,073 --> 00:41:36,427
- New York City.
- New York?

635
00:41:36,592 --> 00:41:39,743
Yeah. I worked at one of those
weirdo theme bars on the West Side.

636
00:41:39,911 --> 00:41:42,506
Wayne and I went to college
in New York.

637
00:41:43,192 --> 00:41:44,910
Then he dropped out.

638
00:41:45,072 --> 00:41:48,906
I got pregnant.
He couldn't get work, so I bartended.

639
00:41:49,071 --> 00:41:51,426
I managed to finish school, though.

640
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:54,059
- Wayne isn't still...?
- Wayne...

641
00:41:54,232 --> 00:41:57,223
...is a professional dancer.

642
00:41:57,391 --> 00:41:59,345
One of those
exotic Chippendale things.

643
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:02,820
He's in Boston, Miami...
I can't keep track.

644
00:42:03,231 --> 00:42:05,461
He left me after Emma was born.

645
00:42:05,631 --> 00:42:08,541
I divorced him
and came running back here.

646
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:13,943
Wayne has this extremely high opinion
of his legs.

647
00:42:14,109 --> 00:42:16,703
You know, I just can't picture you
in the big city.

648
00:42:16,869 --> 00:42:18,620
New York.

649
00:42:18,949 --> 00:42:20,428
It's like me...

650
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,897
- In Grady?
- Yeah.

651
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:26,423
Well, peel an onion,
there's lots of layers.

652
00:42:28,389 --> 00:42:29,868
What layer is Hank on?

653
00:42:31,108 --> 00:42:33,986
Henry Gordon's sweet on me.

654
00:42:34,507 --> 00:42:36,339
And he's pretty decent and solid...

655
00:42:36,508 --> 00:42:39,864
...once you get past the "Insurance
Rebel Without a Clause" routine.

656
00:42:40,507 --> 00:42:42,622
Decent and solid.

657
00:42:43,148 --> 00:42:44,421
Very romantic.

658
00:42:47,227 --> 00:42:52,061
I can see you coming from half a mile
away, Dr. Stone.

659
00:42:52,226 --> 00:42:54,377
You and your slick city ways.

660
00:42:54,547 --> 00:42:56,264
I suspect your version of romance...

661
00:42:56,424 --> 00:42:59,338
...is whatever will separate me
from my panties.

662
00:43:00,865 --> 00:43:04,302
Look, all I'm talking about is dinner.

663
00:43:04,464 --> 00:43:07,105
In public. Wear a dress.

664
00:43:07,266 --> 00:43:09,414
Panties are optional.

665
00:43:10,784 --> 00:43:14,664
Well, I never have had dinner
at the mayor's house.

666
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:16,861
Oh, boy.

667
00:43:17,463 --> 00:43:20,615
And after all,
how could I possibly refuse the man...

668
00:43:20,784 --> 00:43:22,933
...who saved Jasmine
from the butcher?

669
00:43:24,342 --> 00:43:27,654
- What are you talking about?
- Tidwell's pig.

670
00:43:27,822 --> 00:43:29,939
He was about to sell her
for pork chops...

671
00:43:30,103 --> 00:43:32,981
...if you hadn't fixed his foot,
made him feel guilty.

672
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:36,499
Emma loves pigs.
You keeping her over at your house?

673
00:43:43,183 --> 00:43:44,855
Lane, where's Melvin?

674
00:43:45,182 --> 00:43:48,459
Where's Melvin? I want my pig back.

675
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:53,454
Did you say he went to church?
At this hour?

676
00:43:55,861 --> 00:44:00,173
Are you allowed to come out here?
I can't understand what you're saying.

677
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:03,696
Melvin's gone to church.
He's gone to Tylerville.

678
00:44:03,861 --> 00:44:06,249
The pig got took to the butcher.

679
00:44:07,021 --> 00:44:09,215
Melvin took my pig to the butcher.

680
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,537
What?

681
00:44:19,419 --> 00:44:21,774
Mr. Crawford, where's my pig?

682
00:44:21,938 --> 00:44:24,533
You know, Jasmine, my pig.
Is she still alive?

683
00:44:24,699 --> 00:44:27,166
- Yes. She's in back.
- Thank God. Thank God.

684
00:44:27,338 --> 00:44:29,568
- I want her back.
- Doc...

685
00:44:29,738 --> 00:44:32,251
I know what you're going to say.
Do you take plastic?

686
00:44:32,417 --> 00:44:35,012
Not unless it's wrapped around
a stack of cash.

687
00:44:35,177 --> 00:44:36,897
Maybe we can work it out in trade.

688
00:44:37,057 --> 00:44:40,253
I don't know. I ain't been sick
in three years, doc.

689
00:44:41,016 --> 00:44:43,212
I got an idea.

690
00:44:50,736 --> 00:44:55,173
Where'd you learn to carve like that?
You're pretty darn good with a knife.

691
00:45:00,216 --> 00:45:02,171
- Hey, Maddie. Hey, Emma.
- Hi, doc.

692
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:04,930
You guys are pig-sitting
for me tonight?

693
00:45:05,096 --> 00:45:06,528
Hey, Jasmine.

694
00:45:06,695 --> 00:45:08,254
- Who are you?
- Don't tease me.

695
00:45:08,415 --> 00:45:10,451
I'm serious.
You look like Lou, but prettier.

696
00:45:10,614 --> 00:45:14,049
I'm warning you, Stone, I could
probably whoop you in a fistfight.

697
00:45:14,214 --> 00:45:17,252
- Be a good girl.
- Bye.

698
00:45:17,415 --> 00:45:19,052
- Be a good girl.
- We'll be late.

699
00:45:19,213 --> 00:45:23,002
Not too much TV for her.
She's a real pig about that.

700
00:45:26,893 --> 00:45:31,841
Hi. Come on in. Welcome.
You look fantastic.

701
00:45:32,013 --> 00:45:33,684
- And you look handsome too.
- Thanks.

702
00:45:33,852 --> 00:45:36,810
Daddy's in the back yard tending
the firestorm in the barbecue.

703
00:45:36,972 --> 00:45:41,204
- So you're Nick's daughter.
- Gosh, I hope so, I'm in his will.

704
00:45:41,372 --> 00:45:43,761
Hey, y'all, look who's here.

705
00:45:44,412 --> 00:45:46,483
Hello, Lou. Hello, Stone.

706
00:45:46,652 --> 00:45:48,403
Check Hollywood for knives.

707
00:45:48,572 --> 00:45:53,007
I don't want him operating on me later
in case I sneeze or something.

708
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:56,166
Isn't this gonna be fun?

709
00:45:57,931 --> 00:46:01,970
- Oh, no, thank you, I'm a vegetarian.
- I know, dear, but I'm still hopeful.

710
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:04,518
So am I. Vegetarian.

711
00:46:04,689 --> 00:46:07,285
- Since when?
- Then have some of this squash, Ben.

712
00:46:07,449 --> 00:46:08,963
Flesh of the earth. Don't be shy.

713
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:12,202
I'm not sure I trust a man
who doesn't eat meat.

714
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:15,965
Don't be so provincial.
Where's your sense of adventure?

715
00:46:16,129 --> 00:46:20,599
I'd probably give vegetarians a better rate
for life insurance than a smoker, though.

716
00:46:20,768 --> 00:46:23,408
On account of that
lower cholesterol factor.

717
00:46:23,568 --> 00:46:27,720
Daddy, please, new subject.
We wanna hear all about California.

718
00:46:27,888 --> 00:46:30,640
I heard the women out there
have their chests enlarged...

719
00:46:30,806 --> 00:46:33,880
...their thighs vacuumed
and barf on purpose.

720
00:46:34,048 --> 00:46:36,083
Not while people are eating.

721
00:46:36,248 --> 00:46:39,478
Yeah, tell us about
real doctoring, Stone.

722
00:46:39,646 --> 00:46:42,241
You know, big-city medicine.

723
00:46:42,407 --> 00:46:45,956
So much has changed in the 40 years
since you went to medical school...

724
00:46:46,126 --> 00:46:47,719
...I wouldn't know where to start.

725
00:46:49,127 --> 00:46:51,117
- Smart-ass.
- Got you good.

726
00:46:51,606 --> 00:46:54,358
- More squash, Ben?
- No. I mean, no, thank you.

727
00:46:55,125 --> 00:47:00,120
Out of the cradle
Endlessly rocking

728
00:47:00,286 --> 00:47:03,596
Out of the mockingbird's throat

729
00:47:03,764 --> 00:47:06,438
The musical shuttle

730
00:47:06,604 --> 00:47:08,596
Out of the ninth month

731
00:47:08,765 --> 00:47:11,563
- Is this one of the long ones?
- No.

732
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:14,882
Long ones?

733
00:47:15,525 --> 00:47:17,799
Doc Hogue does the complete
Walt Whitman...

734
00:47:17,964 --> 00:47:20,273
...if you don't monitor his drinking.

735
00:47:20,444 --> 00:47:23,880
Down from the shower'd halo

736
00:47:24,043 --> 00:47:27,956
Up from the mystical play of shadows

737
00:47:30,763 --> 00:47:33,993
Man, I haven't seen
this many stars in a long time.

738
00:47:34,444 --> 00:47:37,958
I used to get so bored in this town,
I'd try to count them.

739
00:47:38,284 --> 00:47:40,194
I could've gone to med school.

740
00:47:40,361 --> 00:47:44,116
Just the science part of it
I had a problem with.

741
00:47:44,282 --> 00:47:46,113
I'd lie on my back,
sometimes Wayne...

742
00:47:46,282 --> 00:47:48,557
...would be on top of me
doing the wild thing.

743
00:47:48,721 --> 00:47:51,793
- It was hard not to lose my place.
- God, that's romantic.

744
00:47:51,962 --> 00:47:53,475
Then we moved to Manhattan...

745
00:47:53,801 --> 00:47:56,361
...you could hardly see any stars,
let alone count them.

746
00:47:56,521 --> 00:47:59,433
The stars I'd like to see
are more of the two-legged kind.

747
00:47:59,601 --> 00:48:01,832
Earthquake insurance
is something I'm keen...

748
00:48:02,001 --> 00:48:03,911
...to take a whack at out there in L.A.

749
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,116
Talk about your no-brainer.

750
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:10,319
Collect premiums for a gazillion years,
and if the big one ever does hit...

751
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,357
...declare bankruptcy and retire.

752
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,831
- Decent and solid.
- Nobody's perfect.

753
00:48:17,999 --> 00:48:20,069
Hank, you gotta take Hogue home.

754
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,547
He's about to launch
into "Song of Myself."

755
00:48:22,718 --> 00:48:24,517
My Lord.

756
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,597
Never a dull moment,
hey, Ben Stone?

757
00:48:27,759 --> 00:48:29,555
I'll call you later.

758
00:48:29,917 --> 00:48:31,556
Make sure you got home okay.

759
00:48:48,756 --> 00:48:51,226
- Good night.
- Night.

760
00:49:25,194 --> 00:49:28,185
- I forgot my pig.
- She's sleeping with Em.

761
00:49:28,353 --> 00:49:30,742
I'll drop her off in the morning.

762
00:49:31,152 --> 00:49:34,109
Greek death? Take the edge off.

763
00:49:34,272 --> 00:49:36,469
Take the edge off what?

764
00:49:37,912 --> 00:49:39,504
Me.

765
00:49:42,191 --> 00:49:47,107
- You ran all the way over here.
- Oh, yeah. I ran and...

766
00:49:47,272 --> 00:49:49,831
...walked. Got a stitch in my side.

767
00:49:49,992 --> 00:49:52,027
Why are you giving me
the full-court press...

768
00:49:52,192 --> 00:49:55,183
...if you're only leaving
in a couple of days anyway?

769
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:57,382
You know, I don't know.

770
00:49:57,551 --> 00:50:02,466
It's like it's some kind
of mystical force.

771
00:50:02,632 --> 00:50:05,098
Force or hormones?

772
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:07,740
Hey, come on.

773
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:10,025
All I wanna do is talk.

774
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:14,738
And get you sloppy drunk.

775
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,147
Honesty. That's a new approach.

776
00:50:17,309 --> 00:50:22,177
I know. You're forcing me
into uncharted territory here.

777
00:50:23,069 --> 00:50:25,821
Hell, I might even try chastity.

778
00:50:26,589 --> 00:50:29,147
Seems to work for Hank.

779
00:50:33,868 --> 00:50:35,938
Speak of the devil.

780
00:50:38,307 --> 00:50:41,822
Listen, maybe a rain check?

781
00:50:43,505 --> 00:50:46,783
I never should have accepted
those flowers.

782
00:50:51,627 --> 00:50:53,140
What about tomorrow night?

783
00:50:53,306 --> 00:50:55,900
Desperation. I like this.

784
00:50:57,385 --> 00:51:03,700
Still, I wouldn't want the mayor to have
to lose 10 bucks over me, you know?

785
00:51:23,583 --> 00:51:24,902
Morning.

786
00:51:27,583 --> 00:51:29,335
Funny. Funny.

787
00:51:33,663 --> 00:51:37,779
Morning, doc.
That's a nice pig you got there!

788
00:51:38,102 --> 00:51:39,981
Yeah, that's what they tell me.

789
00:51:40,143 --> 00:51:45,262
Hey, Mr. McClary, be careful you don't
get another hook in your finger!

790
00:51:45,422 --> 00:51:50,097
Don't worry, doc.
We're not using hooks today.

791
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,889
It's all right. It's all right.

792
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:14,172
- He's a nice pig, doc.
- It's a she, actually.

793
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:20,694
Relax, will you?

794
00:52:22,019 --> 00:52:24,897
House calls are probably
my favorite part of the job.

795
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:29,849
Just driving out into the country, seeing
what might pop up around the next bend.

796
00:52:30,578 --> 00:52:32,490
Rainbows.

797
00:52:32,738 --> 00:52:34,535
Frost on the kudzu.

798
00:52:35,257 --> 00:52:39,614
John Muir said it, "Most people
are on the world, not in it."

799
00:52:43,218 --> 00:52:44,492
What?

800
00:52:45,656 --> 00:52:47,408
Nothing.

801
00:52:50,097 --> 00:52:51,735
What?

802
00:53:04,655 --> 00:53:07,489
Listen, you better let me handle
this one alone.

803
00:53:07,656 --> 00:53:10,532
- Obstetrical exam.
- Okay.

804
00:53:11,455 --> 00:53:14,605
"So Jimmy Joe went over to
the Pakistani's house with a shotgun."

805
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:18,084
Excuse me.
Jimmy Joe is Ellen's brother?

806
00:53:18,254 --> 00:53:20,324
No, no. Boyfriend.

807
00:53:20,854 --> 00:53:23,005
I was stumped on that one too.

808
00:53:23,174 --> 00:53:26,211
"He stayed outside shooting holes
in the fella's foreign car...

809
00:53:26,374 --> 00:53:29,205
...until Ellen came out and agreed
to come back home with him.

810
00:53:29,374 --> 00:53:32,570
It's the most romantic thing
Jimmy Joe has ever done for her."

811
00:53:38,333 --> 00:53:39,765
Tough one.

812
00:53:39,932 --> 00:53:43,367
How's Ellen making out
with the Pakistani man?

813
00:53:46,252 --> 00:53:47,765
Get him, get him. Come on, Bubba.

814
00:53:50,171 --> 00:53:53,847
I said... I said, no shots.

815
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:05,528
This won't hurt.

816
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:08,363
Well, I don't see an infection.

817
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:10,327
But...

818
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:14,879
Okay, hold still.

819
00:54:18,970 --> 00:54:21,528
- What is that, a V8?
- He did it.

820
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:27,523
You know, house calls used to be
essential to every doctor's practice.

821
00:54:27,688 --> 00:54:30,600
The only way to know your patients
was to see where they live.

822
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:32,758
How they lived.

823
00:54:33,447 --> 00:54:35,119
Maybe when I get to Halberstrom's...

824
00:54:35,288 --> 00:54:38,199
...I'll get them to institute some kind
of visitation program.

825
00:54:38,368 --> 00:54:39,643
Damn it.

826
00:54:44,087 --> 00:54:45,725
Lou?

827
00:54:48,927 --> 00:54:50,484
Hey, Lou!

828
00:54:53,925 --> 00:54:56,520
Do you see another one?
They mark their way with these.

829
00:54:56,685 --> 00:55:00,565
They're too stupid or too drunk to
remember where they were most times.

830
00:55:00,726 --> 00:55:03,160
- Who?
- Hunters.

831
00:55:03,805 --> 00:55:06,923
Maybe this is the end of...
Yeah. See, there it is.

832
00:55:07,086 --> 00:55:09,440
That's where they sit
and wait for the slaughter.

833
00:55:09,605 --> 00:55:13,836
It's not like they do it for food either.
God, it gets me so hot.

834
00:55:18,684 --> 00:55:20,914
You wanna help me here?

835
00:55:21,404 --> 00:55:22,756
What are you doing?

836
00:55:23,682 --> 00:55:25,083
I'm urinating.

837
00:55:26,483 --> 00:55:29,317
You just drop trou
whenever you feel like it.

838
00:55:29,484 --> 00:55:33,317
Well, it scares the deer away
so the hunters won't get them.

839
00:55:35,202 --> 00:55:37,842
Why don't you just, you know,
say "boo" or something?

840
00:55:38,003 --> 00:55:41,676
I try to spread it around.
A little here, a little there.

841
00:55:43,241 --> 00:55:45,516
Feel free to join in.

842
00:56:07,321 --> 00:56:10,995
Anyway, it's not like I planned
to be pregnant at 19...

843
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:13,151
...but it could have been worse
than Wayne.

844
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,390
Wendall Barnes.

845
00:56:15,559 --> 00:56:16,878
You'd be interested in him.

846
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:20,111
He comes from a whole family
that doesn't have sweat glands.

847
00:56:20,279 --> 00:56:23,271
Really? I'm fascinated
by the gland-less.

848
00:56:23,439 --> 00:56:24,713
I guess it's genetic.

849
00:56:24,878 --> 00:56:28,233
During the summer, they all sleep under
the house on account of the heat.

850
00:56:28,397 --> 00:56:31,594
That's a touching story. Really.
Thanks for sharing that with me.

851
00:56:31,757 --> 00:56:35,352
You don't see a lot of things in Grady,
but what you do see, you see a lot of.

852
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:37,474
Yeah, I'm from a small town myself.

853
00:56:37,918 --> 00:56:39,509
What?

854
00:56:40,918 --> 00:56:45,432
Marionville, Indiana.
Population: 2106.

855
00:56:45,597 --> 00:56:48,588
Home of the world's largest
steam engine.

856
00:56:49,076 --> 00:56:50,668
But you told everybody that you...

857
00:56:50,836 --> 00:56:54,545
No, no, no. Everybody assumed
I was a big-city guy.

858
00:56:54,715 --> 00:56:56,946
Nobody asked.

859
00:56:57,116 --> 00:56:59,629
Anyway, I got out,
and I'm staying out.

860
00:57:01,956 --> 00:57:04,470
Have you still got
your whole family there?

861
00:57:04,635 --> 00:57:06,944
Well, they talked about leaving...

862
00:57:07,115 --> 00:57:09,753
...but my dad never quite...

863
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:12,991
They lived there, they died there.

864
00:57:13,154 --> 00:57:15,304
For better or for worse.

865
00:57:15,795 --> 00:57:19,992
So when I left home, I swore
to myself I was never going back.

866
00:57:20,914 --> 00:57:23,474
It's not the place, it's the person.

867
00:57:24,393 --> 00:57:27,510
Be careful what you wish for,
Ben Stone, you might get it.

868
00:57:27,714 --> 00:57:29,192
What's that supposed to mean?

869
00:57:29,353 --> 00:57:31,913
You never been back,
not even to see your friends?

870
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:35,191
Well, who's got time for friends?

871
00:57:39,552 --> 00:57:42,783
No, you gotta get Dr. Stone
back here ASAP.

872
00:57:42,951 --> 00:57:45,022
We got a possible
coronary emergency.

873
00:57:45,191 --> 00:57:49,025
- Can't Doc Hogue handle this?
- It is Hogue. Over.

874
00:57:52,751 --> 00:57:55,107
- Hey, lie down.
- Oh, crap, I'm doomed.

875
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,382
Lie down now.
You're having a heart attack.

876
00:57:57,551 --> 00:57:59,507
My angina's acting up is all.

877
00:57:59,670 --> 00:58:02,707
- Got any nitro pills down there?
- No, get a bolus of lidocaine.

878
00:58:02,870 --> 00:58:05,146
I'm the senior sawbones around here.

879
00:58:05,311 --> 00:58:08,541
PVCs are too close to your T-waves.
In 30 seconds, you're in trouble.

880
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:10,109
Get him away from me.

881
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:13,819
If I'm wrong, lidocaine won't hurt.
If you're wrong, it's a ventricular fib.

882
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,548
I'm never wrong.

883
00:58:17,029 --> 00:58:19,384
Get the defibrillator over here.

884
00:58:19,628 --> 00:58:21,029
Never wrong.

885
00:58:21,229 --> 00:58:23,184
Four hundred watts.

886
00:58:23,469 --> 00:58:24,743
Clear. Clear!

887
00:58:27,269 --> 00:58:28,826
Heartbeat.

888
00:58:28,989 --> 00:58:32,219
- Sixty.
- Wow, you mean he actually has one.

889
00:58:32,388 --> 00:58:34,856
Keep him on oxygen
and set the lidocaine drip.

890
00:58:35,908 --> 00:58:37,818
Guess I'm staying here tonight.

891
00:58:50,666 --> 00:58:52,180
Oh, doctor.

892
00:58:52,348 --> 00:58:54,576
I've got your bed ready.

893
00:58:56,707 --> 00:58:58,185
Right.

894
00:59:02,186 --> 00:59:03,459
Sleep well, doctor.

895
00:59:11,546 --> 00:59:13,820
At which point, all the bees,
including Melvin...

896
00:59:13,984 --> 00:59:16,373
...lunged off the edge
of the stage like lemmings.

897
00:59:16,544 --> 00:59:19,298
- A standing ovation.
- Variations on a theme.

898
00:59:19,465 --> 00:59:20,816
Sorry I missed it.

899
00:59:20,983 --> 00:59:24,293
That's the first squash pageant
that I missed in 15 years.

900
00:59:24,463 --> 00:59:25,817
What's going on here?

901
00:59:25,983 --> 00:59:29,896
It's called moral support
for the recovering patient.

902
00:59:30,063 --> 00:59:31,496
Cherry cobbler, Ben?

903
00:59:31,663 --> 00:59:35,576
Everybody out. Let's go.
Come on, visiting hours are over.

904
00:59:35,742 --> 00:59:40,258
Don't mind Doc Hollywood. He doesn't
know what it means to be beloved.

905
00:59:42,062 --> 00:59:45,577
If you've come to clean the room,
my bedpan's ripe.

906
00:59:50,101 --> 00:59:53,299
Oh, no.
Not Maddie's sweet potato pie.

907
00:59:53,461 --> 00:59:56,021
You can razz me all you want, doc.

908
00:59:56,462 --> 00:59:59,099
I saved your life last night.

909
00:59:59,341 --> 01:00:02,173
You know it, and I know it.

910
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,818
Gotcha.

911
01:01:32,934 --> 01:01:35,970
Dr. Halberstrom, please.
It's Ben Stone calling.

912
01:01:36,813 --> 01:01:38,963
It's regarding...

913
01:01:39,493 --> 01:01:43,964
I'm not gonna be able to make
my interview on Friday.

914
01:01:44,533 --> 01:01:49,525
I realize the doctor has a tight schedule.
I'm not gonna be able to leave without...

915
01:01:51,492 --> 01:01:52,766
Right.

916
01:01:52,932 --> 01:01:56,845
Is there any way that he can reschedule
the appointment for another time?

917
01:01:57,570 --> 01:02:00,211
All right. Thanks a lot.

918
01:02:28,249 --> 01:02:31,557
Here you go. Get hot and take a shot.
Get hot and take a shot.

919
01:02:31,729 --> 01:02:33,320
What's the object of this one, pal?

920
01:02:33,489 --> 01:02:35,761
Ten shots a dollar.
Five bull's-eyes win a possum.

921
01:02:35,927 --> 01:02:39,396
- Suppose I was to hit five out of five.
- I'll give you two possums.

922
01:02:47,766 --> 01:02:52,318
Sir, run Henry a tab.
He feels deadly today.

923
01:02:54,606 --> 01:02:57,040
Evening, Dr. Stone.

924
01:03:09,684 --> 01:03:11,004
Hey, doc.

925
01:03:13,763 --> 01:03:16,802
The new one's in.
Your chariot's good as new.

926
01:03:16,965 --> 01:03:19,273
Or good as new used, since it's old.

927
01:03:19,444 --> 01:03:22,243
- You fixed my car?
- Even all the ashtrays.

928
01:03:22,403 --> 01:03:24,519
Oh, man, I can't believe this.

929
01:03:24,683 --> 01:03:25,957
Melvin, thanks, man.

930
01:03:28,123 --> 01:03:29,840
There's always some extra parts...

931
01:03:30,003 --> 01:03:32,313
...when I put them back together.
I don't know why.

932
01:03:32,484 --> 01:03:35,679
But you go ahead on. Keep them.

933
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:42,232
- Dance with me or I'm dog food.
- What?

934
01:03:42,402 --> 01:03:45,634
- Wendall Barnes.
- Of the gland-less Barnes?

935
01:03:45,802 --> 01:03:48,031
- Jesus.
- Yeah. Come on.

936
01:03:48,202 --> 01:03:50,396
Absolutely.

937
01:04:05,121 --> 01:04:06,873
You see, the trick...

938
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:11,473
...is just to visualize the target
on the backs of your eyeballs...

939
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:16,393
...and then pretend you're just
shooting yourself in the eye.

940
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:25,794
I can't keep up.

941
01:04:43,718 --> 01:04:45,355
How's Hogue?

942
01:04:45,517 --> 01:04:47,109
Meaner than ever.

943
01:04:50,586 --> 01:04:53,228
[ music ]

944
01:04:53,836 --> 01:04:55,589
Dance?

945
01:05:01,595 --> 01:05:03,506
Where's Hank?

946
01:05:03,755 --> 01:05:05,586
I forget.

947
01:05:05,594 --> 01:05:07,448
" Crazy "

948
01:05:07,456 --> 01:05:15,636
" I'm crazy for feeling so lonely "

949
01:05:16,944 --> 01:05:20,772
" I'm crazy "

950
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:28,686
" Crazy for feeling so blue "

951
01:05:29,894 --> 01:05:35,454
" I knew, you'd love me "

952
01:05:35,462 --> 01:05:41,065
" as long as you wanted "

953
01:05:41,774 --> 01:05:45,376
" And then someday "

954
01:05:45,384 --> 01:05:48,210
" you'd leave me "

955
01:05:48,218 --> 01:05:54,008
" for somebody new "

956
01:05:54,986 --> 01:05:59,628
" Worry "

957
01:05:59,636 --> 01:06:07,848
" Why, do I let myself worry? "

958
01:06:09,856 --> 01:06:12,330
" Wonderin, "

959
01:06:12,338 --> 01:06:16,064
" what in the world "

960
01:06:16,072 --> 01:06:20,476
" did I do? "

961
01:06:20,484 --> 01:06:24,892
" Oh. Crazy, "

962
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:27,890 
" for thinking "

963
01:06:27,898 --> 01:06:30,060
" that my love "

964
01:06:30,068 --> 01:06:34,776
" could hold you. "

965
01:06:34,784 --> 01:06:39,054
" I'm crazy for tryin "

966
01:06:39,562 --> 01:06:43,004
" I'm crazy for cryin "

967
01:06:43,010 --> 01:06:45,490
" and I'm crazy "

968
01:06:45,498 --> 01:07:00,004
" for lovin you. "

969
01:07:03,146 --> 01:07:05,137
The music stopped.

970
01:07:05,665 --> 01:07:07,496
What music?

971
01:07:11,304 --> 01:07:13,023
Dr. Stone.

972
01:07:13,465 --> 01:07:16,537
- I have a present for you.
- Thanks, judge.

973
01:07:16,704 --> 01:07:20,458
I want to thank you for saving
my old friend Hogue's miserable life.

974
01:07:20,624 --> 01:07:22,819
I wouldn't be able
to call myself a Christian...

975
01:07:22,983 --> 01:07:25,658
...if I didn't pardon you
on the remainder of your sentence.

976
01:07:25,824 --> 01:07:27,780
You're free to go
whenever you want.

977
01:07:27,943 --> 01:07:30,059
What I wouldn't give to be young
on the road...

978
01:07:30,223 --> 01:07:32,943
...footloose and fancy-free.

979
01:07:33,102 --> 01:07:36,175
Did I tell you? I've already got plans
for a new fence.

980
01:07:36,343 --> 01:07:38,616
All of a sudden,
I got a bug in my ear...

981
01:07:38,782 --> 01:07:41,899
...for one of those solid-oak numbers
with curly tops.

982
01:07:44,263 --> 01:07:45,899
Victory.

983
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:48,212
Did you kill that critter
all by yourself?

984
01:07:48,381 --> 01:07:49,815
Very funny.

985
01:07:49,981 --> 01:07:54,532
Don't you have some urgent business
thousands of miles away from here?

986
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:58,534
Vialula, your daughter was dumping
grasshoppers in the punch bowl again.

987
01:07:58,701 --> 01:07:59,771
Only two.

988
01:07:59,941 --> 01:08:05,492
- Shake a leg with the judicial branch?
- Why, I'd love to. Thank you.

989
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:07,460
Would you hold this possum?

990
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:11,010
I think it's time I reacquainted
your mama with some real dancing.

991
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:13,740
No offense, Hollywood.

992
01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:21,727
When you gonna bring
your pig back around?

993
01:08:30,858 --> 01:08:33,656
Hey there, Ben Stone.
Hey, how are you?

994
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:35,933
Been looking for you.
What a great day.

995
01:08:36,097 --> 01:08:38,566
Boy, this is it.

996
01:08:38,738 --> 01:08:42,014
The pinnacle of existence,
the grandeur of Grady.

997
01:08:42,177 --> 01:08:44,327
Sap of life.
Couldn't be happier if I was twins.

998
01:08:44,497 --> 01:08:48,285
- You put on a hell of a festival, mayor.
- Ain't you nice to say so.

999
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:52,244
Ben, let's talk turkey.
Or squash, as it were.

1000
01:08:52,417 --> 01:08:54,691
- About what?
- Home.

1001
01:08:54,856 --> 01:08:56,130
Heart.

1002
01:08:56,297 --> 01:08:57,776
Happiness.

1003
01:08:57,937 --> 01:08:59,607
You belong here, Ben Stone.

1004
01:08:59,777 --> 01:09:03,564
Breaks my heart to think of you
out there in the land of lunatics.

1005
01:09:03,735 --> 01:09:06,966
I'm danged if I'll let you go
without holding up a mirror to your face.

1006
01:09:07,135 --> 01:09:11,014
Like that smile of contentment there.
So you see that? See there?

1007
01:09:11,175 --> 01:09:15,213
That's a face that's liked and loved.
A face with friends and a future.

1008
01:09:15,375 --> 01:09:17,763
Can't find some other way
to force me to stay?

1009
01:09:17,934 --> 01:09:19,253
Ben.

1010
01:09:19,413 --> 01:09:21,210
I am everything but devious.

1011
01:09:21,373 --> 01:09:24,765
Mayor, could you come check
these ribs and tell me if they're done?

1012
01:09:24,933 --> 01:09:26,605
I sure can.

1013
01:09:26,774 --> 01:09:28,888
Rigors of the job, huh?

1014
01:09:29,293 --> 01:09:33,490
Well, you got your fire way too high,
I'll tell you that.

1015
01:09:33,972 --> 01:09:35,292
Well, don't do that.

1016
01:09:37,293 --> 01:09:40,249
Come on, come on.

1017
01:09:42,692 --> 01:09:44,922
- Hi, doc.
- Gentlemen.

1018
01:10:20,209 --> 01:10:22,403
Careful with those things.

1019
01:10:38,607 --> 01:10:42,362
I know I shouldn't be doing this because
you're leaving, but I don't care.

1020
01:10:42,527 --> 01:10:44,359
I can't help it.

1021
01:10:44,528 --> 01:10:46,119
So get in.

1022
01:10:46,407 --> 01:10:50,285
- Do you mean what I think you mean?
- Just get in if you're gonna get in.

1023
01:10:56,527 --> 01:10:59,246
Lou, I gotta be honest with you.

1024
01:10:59,406 --> 01:11:02,158
Rowing a boat is not
what I had in mind.

1025
01:11:06,365 --> 01:11:08,003
Not bad, huh?

1026
01:11:11,285 --> 01:11:12,557
Incredible.

1027
01:11:14,324 --> 01:11:16,599
- What was that?
- Freshwater mullet.

1028
01:11:16,763 --> 01:11:20,837
They see the sparks from the skyrockets,
think it's food and jump for it.

1029
01:11:21,004 --> 01:11:22,960
That's scary.

1030
01:11:23,204 --> 01:11:25,159
Maybe I could...

1031
01:11:25,644 --> 01:11:27,760
...sit next to you,
and you could protect me.

1032
01:11:27,924 --> 01:11:29,959
No. You'll throw us off balance.

1033
01:11:30,123 --> 01:11:32,272
I want you off balance.

1034
01:11:32,443 --> 01:11:34,354
- He's in the boat!
- Hold still.

1035
01:11:34,524 --> 01:11:36,434
- Get him.
- Watch it, you'll tip us over.

1036
01:11:36,603 --> 01:11:38,673
- Get him, Lou.
- Okay, I got it.

1037
01:11:43,281 --> 01:11:45,591
You did that on purpose.

1038
01:11:46,522 --> 01:11:48,956
All right, I admit it.

1039
01:11:49,403 --> 01:11:53,076
I worked my way through college
by training bass.

1040
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:17,038
Lou?

1041
01:12:17,558 --> 01:12:19,390
It's okay.

1042
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:22,554
Listen, if you don't wanna...

1043
01:12:23,079 --> 01:12:26,957
Ben, I don't think I've ever wanted
anything more in my entire life, ever.

1044
01:12:27,638 --> 01:12:30,914
I'm just not used to being
a one-night stand.

1045
01:12:33,518 --> 01:12:36,475
You don't have to be.
I mean, I could...

1046
01:12:36,678 --> 01:12:40,192
No. I wouldn't know what to do
with myself in Los Angeles.

1047
01:12:40,357 --> 01:12:42,792
There are too many choices.

1048
01:12:44,277 --> 01:12:46,836
Let's not think about it, okay?

1049
01:12:52,236 --> 01:12:54,306
I can't do this.

1050
01:13:05,995 --> 01:13:10,433
Mind walking from here? I don't wanna
give the gossips any more fat to chew.

1051
01:13:12,874 --> 01:13:14,546
Right.

1052
01:13:15,355 --> 01:13:18,266
Don't worry, Benjamin,
it'll all work out.

1053
01:13:37,073 --> 01:13:38,983
Hey, Jasmine.

1054
01:13:59,311 --> 01:14:00,824
Hey, Hank.

1055
01:14:01,710 --> 01:14:05,259
You've made me real mad.

1056
01:14:06,830 --> 01:14:08,309
About what?

1057
01:14:08,470 --> 01:14:10,381
What do you think?

1058
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:13,621
I know you were out on that lake
with her.

1059
01:14:13,869 --> 01:14:17,099
It makes me sick
to think of you and her.

1060
01:14:17,269 --> 01:14:19,579
- Nothing happened.
- Oh, right.

1061
01:14:19,748 --> 01:14:21,819
Nothing happened!

1062
01:14:21,989 --> 01:14:24,059
Come on, tough guy!
Come on, country boy!

1063
01:14:24,228 --> 01:14:26,867
You wanna take a shot at me, huh?
Come on!

1064
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:29,702
- What are you doing?
- Come on, country boy, get up! Let's go.

1065
01:14:30,269 --> 01:14:31,826
Are you paranoid or something?

1066
01:14:34,389 --> 01:14:35,946
No.

1067
01:14:36,708 --> 01:14:38,857
But I'm a little confused.

1068
01:14:46,668 --> 01:14:49,022
I suppose you and her
will be getting married now.

1069
01:14:55,347 --> 01:14:57,336
It's the Southern way.

1070
01:14:57,506 --> 01:15:00,100
Man and woman as one.

1071
01:15:00,427 --> 01:15:05,658
Make sacrifices to build equity
in a future that has security.

1072
01:15:06,105 --> 01:15:08,573
Why do you sound like
a Mutual of Omaha ad?

1073
01:15:08,866 --> 01:15:10,821
Fine, joke it up.

1074
01:15:10,986 --> 01:15:13,100
At least I was prepared to marry her.

1075
01:15:15,665 --> 01:15:17,143
She's not in love with you.

1076
01:15:18,264 --> 01:15:20,858
Okay. That's the only
roadblock, though.

1077
01:15:24,385 --> 01:15:26,339
Let me ask you something.

1078
01:15:27,263 --> 01:15:30,972
Don't you think a guy is entitled
to choose his own destiny?

1079
01:15:31,544 --> 01:15:34,137
Whether it's in a small town
or even in California.

1080
01:15:34,303 --> 01:15:36,657
It's just that he shouldn't have it
handed to him.

1081
01:15:36,823 --> 01:15:40,054
Not like it's a... You know, like...

1082
01:15:40,222 --> 01:15:41,814
A hat?

1083
01:15:43,822 --> 01:15:46,052
Right. Okay, good. Like a hat.

1084
01:15:46,221 --> 01:15:49,373
Your father and your grandfather wore it,
now you're stuck with it.

1085
01:15:49,541 --> 01:15:52,136
Only the damn thing is too small.
It just doesn't fit.

1086
01:15:52,302 --> 01:15:57,329
- I hate a tight hat.
- There's a lot of hats out there.

1087
01:15:57,581 --> 01:16:01,130
And even if this one fits...

1088
01:16:01,302 --> 01:16:03,019
...and I'm not saying that it does...

1089
01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:07,092
...how do you know it's the right one
when you haven't tried any others on?

1090
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:09,377
I sure haven't.

1091
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:13,208
I mean, that's what
I'm talking about.

1092
01:16:14,261 --> 01:16:16,899
I just don't wanna screw up her life.

1093
01:16:18,059 --> 01:16:20,096
You know, Hollywood...

1094
01:16:20,259 --> 01:16:24,410
...sometimes a man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do.

1095
01:16:24,579 --> 01:16:29,289
And maybe...
Maybe it's in California.

1096
01:16:31,258 --> 01:16:33,567
Yeah, maybe you're right.

1097
01:16:34,738 --> 01:16:38,650
- Well, I'm glad we got that cleaned up.
- Me too, Hank.

1098
01:16:38,818 --> 01:16:41,207
Don't that take the rag off the bush?

1099
01:16:41,377 --> 01:16:43,651
Don't forget what I told you.

1100
01:17:44,572 --> 01:17:45,847
Hey, please!

1101
01:17:49,493 --> 01:17:51,402
Shit.

1102
01:18:00,130 --> 01:18:02,007
Shit.

1103
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:03,849
Shit.

1104
01:18:15,410 --> 01:18:17,128
Dr. Stone.

1105
01:18:17,290 --> 01:18:19,325
Mary. Decided to drop by,
see how you were doing.

1106
01:18:19,489 --> 01:18:23,483
No damn good. Water's broke. I hurt.
This ain't like none of the others.

1107
01:18:23,649 --> 01:18:25,525
They never are.

1108
01:18:26,488 --> 01:18:29,481
Did Doc Hogue tell you this baby
might come out the wrong way?

1109
01:18:30,649 --> 01:18:33,242
He's coming.
He don't care which way.

1110
01:18:34,848 --> 01:18:38,045
- Fiddlesticks. Don't push, Mary.
- I can run, get an ambulance.

1111
01:18:38,208 --> 01:18:41,723
There's no time for that. Go into my
duffle bag, there's four clean shirts.

1112
01:18:41,887 --> 01:18:44,639
Get them and rip them
into even pieces.

1113
01:18:45,446 --> 01:18:49,155
Listen, Mary, don't push. I know
you want to, but don't push.

1114
01:18:49,327 --> 01:18:51,760
I'll try to turn him around
so he comes the right way.

1115
01:18:52,366 --> 01:18:54,243
Is it these ones?

1116
01:18:54,406 --> 01:18:58,685
- "Aramana"?
- Armani. Those are the ones.

1117
01:19:02,925 --> 01:19:06,680
Okay, now. Now! That's it.
Great. Great. Great.

1118
01:19:06,844 --> 01:19:08,881
Okay, okay, okay.

1119
01:19:09,565 --> 01:19:13,035
Now go! Push. Push, Mary.
You're doing great.

1120
01:19:13,204 --> 01:19:15,240
You're doing great.

1121
01:19:15,724 --> 01:19:17,716
I got a leg. I got a leg.

1122
01:19:25,523 --> 01:19:28,800
All right. Go ahead, go ahead.

1123
01:19:29,364 --> 01:19:31,159
Someone's coming.

1124
01:19:31,323 --> 01:19:34,234
Doc, someone's coming.

1125
01:19:35,003 --> 01:19:36,880
Okay, all right.

1126
01:19:41,482 --> 01:19:43,359
Push! Push, Mary!

1127
01:19:52,841 --> 01:19:54,116
Doc, your car.

1128
01:19:56,282 --> 01:19:57,794
What do I do?

1129
01:19:59,121 --> 01:20:00,793
Okay.

1130
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:04,156
- Good girl!
- What do I do?

1131
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:05,594
Push, Mary.

1132
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:11,112
It's a girl!

1133
01:20:44,918 --> 01:20:47,384
I think I can fix that.

1134
01:21:02,035 --> 01:21:05,027
- You rang?
- First breech you ever delivered?

1135
01:21:06,515 --> 01:21:08,710
First baby I ever delivered.

1136
01:21:08,876 --> 01:21:10,148
By myself.

1137
01:21:11,035 --> 01:21:13,502
- Whiskey?
- No, thanks.

1138
01:21:13,673 --> 01:21:16,109
In fact, I wouldn't recommend that
for you, either.

1139
01:21:16,275 --> 01:21:18,835
You're not my doctor,
and you're not my wife...

1140
01:21:18,994 --> 01:21:21,952
...so I guess you don't have
very much to say about it.

1141
01:21:24,274 --> 01:21:27,073
You're not fixing to stay, huh, Stone?

1142
01:21:27,233 --> 01:21:29,464
Changed your mind, huh?

1143
01:21:29,633 --> 01:21:32,194
Now that your car's
all busted to bubkes...

1144
01:21:32,353 --> 01:21:35,981
...and you're feeling pretty good
about yourself in general, huh?

1145
01:21:37,752 --> 01:21:39,028
Come here.

1146
01:21:46,952 --> 01:21:49,227
I added them up once.

1147
01:21:49,392 --> 01:21:53,180
Over 700 babies I delivered
in this town over the years.

1148
01:21:53,351 --> 01:21:54,626
Nurse Packer.

1149
01:21:54,792 --> 01:21:59,659
She popped right out complete with
teeth and hair and bit me. An omen.

1150
01:21:59,831 --> 01:22:01,105
Nicholson.

1151
01:22:01,271 --> 01:22:02,909
Hank.

1152
01:22:03,869 --> 01:22:08,625
I gave them birth, saw them through
every sneeze and sniffle...

1153
01:22:08,791 --> 01:22:11,987
...and sometimes even walked them
to the gravesite.

1154
01:22:12,710 --> 01:22:16,497
They're pretty well
my portfolio, Stone.

1155
01:22:16,669 --> 01:22:20,868
That and an old car, an old house.

1156
01:22:21,229 --> 01:22:24,346
I wouldn't trade any of them for gold.

1157
01:22:25,149 --> 01:22:27,265
Well, maybe gold.

1158
01:22:27,909 --> 01:22:30,138
Or cash money.

1159
01:22:33,548 --> 01:22:35,344
- Hey.
- Doc.

1160
01:22:36,308 --> 01:22:38,104
Hey, Mary, how's our girl?

1161
01:22:38,268 --> 01:22:41,942
We decided she's gonna be
"Benjamina," after you.

1162
01:22:42,788 --> 01:22:44,584
What?

1163
01:22:45,347 --> 01:22:47,098
Thank you.

1164
01:22:47,547 --> 01:22:50,619
There's an obstetrician coming up
from Athens General later...

1165
01:22:50,787 --> 01:22:53,141
...just to make sure everything's okay.

1166
01:22:54,346 --> 01:22:55,938
Benjamina.

1167
01:22:57,746 --> 01:23:02,024
Yo, doc, I wanted to just thank you
for, you know, everything...

1168
01:23:02,186 --> 01:23:05,063
...so I made you this in appreciation.

1169
01:23:05,746 --> 01:23:10,865
I know it ain't very much, so if there's
ever anything at all I can do for you...

1170
01:23:11,026 --> 01:23:15,336
Just let me know what happens
with Ellen, Jimmy Joe and the Pakistani.

1171
01:23:34,582 --> 01:23:36,698
I heard what happened last night.
You did great.

1172
01:23:37,463 --> 01:23:41,580
- I didn't know what I was doing.
- Well, sometimes that's the best way.

1173
01:23:42,983 --> 01:23:44,859
There's something
that I wanted to say.

1174
01:23:45,022 --> 01:23:48,856
Something I wanted to say
to you first. Is that okay?

1175
01:23:49,422 --> 01:23:53,700
So I've been doing a lot of thinking
about last night.

1176
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:56,660
Last night was really difficult.

1177
01:23:56,942 --> 01:24:01,651
Everything's all turned around now.
I've been thinking about you and me...

1178
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:05,210
...and big cities, small towns...
- Well, I'm gonna marry Hank.

1179
01:24:07,261 --> 01:24:09,251
I've decided.

1180
01:24:13,179 --> 01:24:15,136
It's a plane ticket to Los Angeles.

1181
01:24:15,739 --> 01:24:17,537
The whole town chipped in.

1182
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:22,454
We've kept you here this long, and if you
wait for Melvin to fix your car again...

1183
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:26,693
You got Los Angeles waiting for you.

1184
01:24:26,858 --> 01:24:29,771
I've got Emma. It's not fair to you.

1185
01:24:29,938 --> 01:24:32,770
Hank's steady, and he's here.

1186
01:24:32,938 --> 01:24:34,577
You...

1187
01:24:35,338 --> 01:24:39,250
You're like a big, bright shooting star and
you're right, Ben, you'd burn out here.

1188
01:24:44,576 --> 01:24:46,170
Wait a minute.

1189
01:24:51,535 --> 01:24:54,654
Well, Ben Stone, you have five minutes
to say goodbye to Shangri-la.

1190
01:24:54,817 --> 01:24:58,206
Cotton will give you a police escort
to the airport.

1191
01:25:05,335 --> 01:25:07,611
We made you a sack lunch.

1192
01:25:07,775 --> 01:25:10,085
Airplane food can cause gas.

1193
01:25:15,935 --> 01:25:18,084
I guess I'll watch after your pig.

1194
01:25:18,254 --> 01:25:21,486
Just hope she takes to the farm
after living in town like this.

1195
01:25:22,134 --> 01:25:24,012
Appreciate it.

1196
01:25:24,454 --> 01:25:26,887
A lot of folks around here
gonna miss you.

1197
01:25:27,693 --> 01:25:31,082
I don't mean me.
But a lot of folks.

1198
01:26:01,730 --> 01:26:03,163
Adieu.

1199
01:26:11,570 --> 01:26:14,209
Back to the interstate,
Ben Stone, huh?

1200
01:26:14,370 --> 01:26:15,767
Back to the interstate.

1201
01:27:43,682 --> 01:27:45,558
You okay?

1202
01:27:46,403 --> 01:27:48,836
Oh, yes, I am fine.

1203
01:27:53,562 --> 01:27:57,157
Good morning, Halberstrom Clinic.
Could you hold, please.

1204
01:27:57,322 --> 01:28:01,234
Good morning, Halberstrom Clinic.
Good morning, Halberstrom Clinic.

1205
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:04,676
Oh, hold. Yes, doctor.

1206
01:28:05,481 --> 01:28:07,597
- Mr. Stone?
- Dr. Stone.

1207
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:11,676
Dr. Halberstrom can see you now.

1208
01:28:25,799 --> 01:28:28,949
Do you have any idea how many
applications I went through this year?

1209
01:28:29,118 --> 01:28:31,838
Yes, sir. That's why I knew
this interview was important.

1210
01:28:31,999 --> 01:28:34,717
I would've been here earlier
if I could've been. I think...

1211
01:28:34,878 --> 01:28:39,268
I know you're a great surgeon, Stone.
That whole pile is full of great surgeons.

1212
01:28:39,637 --> 01:28:41,468
Did you expect special consideration...

1213
01:28:41,638 --> 01:28:43,549
...because we're from
the same hometown?

1214
01:28:43,717 --> 01:28:45,787
- Because I knew your father?
- No, sir.

1215
01:28:45,957 --> 01:28:48,517
Good. Because you didn't get shit.

1216
01:28:48,677 --> 01:28:52,908
You wouldn't be here at all if it weren't
for a call I got from Dr. Aurelius Hogue.

1217
01:28:55,156 --> 01:28:56,588
Dr. Hogue called you?

1218
01:28:56,756 --> 01:28:59,669
I saw two doctors last week
with more experience than you...

1219
01:28:59,836 --> 01:29:02,429
...and better board certification scores.

1220
01:29:03,636 --> 01:29:06,547
Dr. Hogue's a piece of work, isn't he?

1221
01:29:06,876 --> 01:29:08,194
What did he say?

1222
01:29:08,354 --> 01:29:11,985
That you were doing volunteer
family practice down South somewhere.

1223
01:29:13,995 --> 01:29:17,748
Yes. Yeah. Yes, yes, that's right.

1224
01:29:18,475 --> 01:29:21,989
Went there to get that small-town chip
off your shoulder, didn't you?

1225
01:29:22,154 --> 01:29:26,114
- Yeah.
- Well, you're braver than I was, Stone.

1226
01:29:26,274 --> 01:29:29,311
Any case,
Hogue said you were, quote:

1227
01:29:29,474 --> 01:29:33,261
"One hellaciously fine physician."

1228
01:29:33,432 --> 01:29:37,108
That I would be "a bovine,
clodpated, citified moron"...

1229
01:29:37,273 --> 01:29:39,628
...if I didn't hire you on the spot.

1230
01:29:39,793 --> 01:29:41,670
I wrote it down so I wouldn't forget.

1231
01:29:41,833 --> 01:29:44,471
So I guess you're in, Stone. Congrats.

1232
01:29:44,632 --> 01:29:46,542
What time do I tee off?

1233
01:29:46,712 --> 01:29:48,862
You do play golf, don't you?

1234
01:29:49,031 --> 01:29:52,229
Great. Don't worry about that.
It's not anywhere you can see it.

1235
01:29:52,391 --> 01:29:56,144
The secret to this business is to get
a good pace going for yourself.

1236
01:29:56,310 --> 01:29:59,986
Nobody likes to admit it,
but medicine's a volume business.

1237
01:30:00,151 --> 01:30:02,744
Ninety-nine percent of what we do
is boilerplate surgery.

1238
01:30:02,909 --> 01:30:05,629
It means we can afford
the one percent that's meaningful.

1239
01:30:05,790 --> 01:30:09,385
Disfigurements, birth defects,
hare lips.

1240
01:30:10,350 --> 01:30:13,501
Cleft palates.
You live for those moments.

1241
01:30:13,669 --> 01:30:15,706
The bigger you get, the bigger the nut.

1242
01:30:15,869 --> 01:30:19,545
We're a service industry. Comes with
the territory. Fixed costs, specialization.

1243
01:30:19,710 --> 01:30:22,347
People adjust to it or fail.
Look at cable TV.

1244
01:30:22,509 --> 01:30:24,625
You're gonna see
some changes, Stone.

1245
01:30:25,269 --> 01:30:29,546
Stone, see if patient number 434
is in preop yet.

1246
01:30:29,709 --> 01:30:32,939
We can squeeze one more in
before lunch, don't you think?

1247
01:31:11,145 --> 01:31:14,182
Hi. This is
the National Weather Service forecast...

1248
01:31:14,344 --> 01:31:16,619
...for the greater Grady area tomorrow.

1249
01:31:16,785 --> 01:31:19,662
There'll be plenty of sunshine
and blue skies.

1250
01:31:19,824 --> 01:31:22,462
The old temperature
should be in the 90s again...

1251
01:31:22,624 --> 01:31:26,741
...but a cool afternoon breeze will
make it all worthwhile come evening.

1252
01:31:26,903 --> 01:31:30,657
Y'all look out for the lightning bugs
after sunset.

1253
01:31:49,581 --> 01:31:51,891
- Actress alert.
- Excuse me.

1254
01:31:52,062 --> 01:31:53,892
Some girl called for you.

1255
01:31:54,062 --> 01:31:58,498
Said you'd know who it was,
said she'd meet you at this bar.

1256
01:31:59,341 --> 01:32:03,458
Like, as if you're gonna rush
right over there. Right.

1257
01:32:03,620 --> 01:32:08,818
Totally unbelievable Southern accent.
An actress, I'll bet.

1258
01:32:38,378 --> 01:32:42,006
- Hi. Can I help you?
- I'm supposed to meet someone, a girl.

1259
01:32:42,658 --> 01:32:44,535
Ben.

1260
01:32:51,616 --> 01:32:53,686
Nancy Lee?

1261
01:32:58,015 --> 01:33:03,613
Well, I had to give it a shot, you know.
I just thought, just in case.

1262
01:33:04,096 --> 01:33:05,687
Guess not.

1263
01:33:07,175 --> 01:33:09,085
You...

1264
01:33:09,815 --> 01:33:12,410
You drove all this way
just to bring me my car?

1265
01:33:12,575 --> 01:33:13,849
Sort of.

1266
01:33:14,015 --> 01:33:17,087
Well, I mean, it gave me an excuse
to get the hell out of Grady.

1267
01:33:17,254 --> 01:33:19,688
Pardon my French.
Things were bad before...

1268
01:33:19,854 --> 01:33:23,051
...but since you left,
they got positively stagnant.

1269
01:33:26,334 --> 01:33:29,451
- How's Hogue?
- Well, he's the same.

1270
01:33:32,014 --> 01:33:34,812
- Melvin?
- Same.

1271
01:33:35,573 --> 01:33:36,846
How's your dad?

1272
01:33:38,253 --> 01:33:40,686
Why don't you ask me about Vialula?

1273
01:33:41,653 --> 01:33:45,645
What's there to ask, really?
I guess she and Hank are...

1274
01:33:45,812 --> 01:33:47,404
You're in my chair.

1275
01:33:49,252 --> 01:33:51,321
Slide a bit, Nancy Lee.

1276
01:33:53,973 --> 01:33:58,568
There's a man in the toilet selling
aftershave. Now, what's that all about?

1277
01:33:59,690 --> 01:34:01,124
Hank.

1278
01:34:02,890 --> 01:34:04,608
What are you doing here?

1279
01:34:04,770 --> 01:34:07,888
Took my own advice, doc.
Knowing when to stay, when to get out.

1280
01:34:08,811 --> 01:34:11,563
I thought you and Lou
were gonna get...

1281
01:34:11,729 --> 01:34:15,801
Lou was never gonna marry me.
So I broke it off, clean.

1282
01:34:17,249 --> 01:34:19,241
You dumped her?

1283
01:34:19,409 --> 01:34:21,526
A man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do...

1284
01:34:21,690 --> 01:34:25,602
...even if it's in California.
Sense of higher purpose, you know?

1285
01:34:27,648 --> 01:34:29,480
Is that a star?

1286
01:34:29,648 --> 01:34:32,243
No, that's Ted Danson.

1287
01:34:43,887 --> 01:34:46,355
I'm going for breakfast.
You want anything?

1288
01:34:46,527 --> 01:34:48,756
How about Bob Barker?

1289
01:34:48,926 --> 01:34:51,236
I'll see what I can do.

1290
01:34:59,846 --> 01:35:01,802
Howdy.

1291
01:35:06,085 --> 01:35:08,121
You steal that pig?

1292
01:35:09,006 --> 01:35:12,121
I heard she was wasting away
in this one-pig town, so...

1293
01:35:12,284 --> 01:35:14,479
And you thought you'd come back
and rescue her.

1294
01:35:14,964 --> 01:35:17,525
Yeah. Something like that.

1295
01:35:18,244 --> 01:35:20,553
What makes you think
she'll take you back?

1296
01:35:22,605 --> 01:35:24,117
Because I love her.

1297
01:35:27,764 --> 01:35:30,232
Go back to Los Angeles.

1298
01:35:31,124 --> 01:35:33,717
I don't want Los Angeles.

1299
01:35:34,004 --> 01:35:35,833
I want you.

1300
01:35:45,163 --> 01:35:47,550
You got great tonsils.

1301
01:35:50,922 --> 01:35:52,718
That ain't all.

1302
01:35:54,361 --> 01:35:57,434
I just thought of something.
I can collect that $ 10 from Nicholson.

1303
01:35:57,601 --> 01:35:59,398
- You lost that bet.
- I did not.

1304
01:35:59,561 --> 01:36:00,995
- Who says?
- Me.

1305
01:36:01,161 --> 01:36:05,836
- You have no say. You are the bet.
- The bet was for one week. You lost.

1306
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,433
It's your word against mine.

1307
01:36:07,601 --> 01:36:10,831
You would sully my reputation
for 10 measly dollars?

1308
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:14,628
Absolutely. I don't even know
what "sully" means.
