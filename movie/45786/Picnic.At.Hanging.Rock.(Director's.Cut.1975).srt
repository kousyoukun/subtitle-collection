Good morning, Mrs. Appleyard.

00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,933
Well, young ladies, we are
indeed fortunate in the weather

66
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:22,935
for our picnic to Hanging Rock.

67
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:26,939
I have instructed Mademoiselle that
as the day is likely to be warm,

68
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:30,943
you may remove your gloves once
the drag has passed through Woodend.

You will partake of luncheon
at the picnic grounds near the rock.

70
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:38,940
Once again let me remind you that
the rock is extremely dangerous,

71
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:43,956
and you are therefore forbidden
any tomboy foolishness

even on the lower slopes.

I also wish to remind you, the vicinity
is renowned for its venomous snakes

and poisonous ants
of various species.

is Miss McCraw?

We left her behind
at the rock.

of their senses?

Hmm, um, the first one
was tall and dark.

401
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:38,048
Um, then there was
the little dumpy one,

402
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:41,051
then the girl
with the glasses,

403
00:43:41,051 --> 00:43:45,044
and the last one
was slim and fair.

there was only three of them.

Oh-Oh, ye...

408
00:43:58,068 --> 00:44:02,072
That's because the dumpy one
was back a little.

409
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:06,076
And then they moved off
into the trees

410
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:10,069
and that's the last
we saw of them.

a little higher.

01:13:00,809 --> 01:13:04,813
why is the rest
of the body unmarked?

652
01:13:04,813 --> 01:13:08,817
It's quite unblemished.

653
01:13:08,817 --> 01:13:12,810
And the feet, too, are quite unmarked,
which is very strange

654
01:13:13,822 --> 01:13:17,826
as she was not wearing shoes
or stockings when she was found.

655
01:13:17,826 --> 01:13:20,829
We found no trace of 'em
up on the rocks.

Mmm.

657
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:28,826
She's quite intact.

658
01:13:29,838 --> 01:13:33,831
(Doctor)
I'd give my head to know
what really happened up there.

659
01:13:37,846 --> 01:13:41,839
She's quite intact.

What is it, my girl?

01:13:46,855 --> 01:13:48,857
Well, ma'am,
it's Miss Irma.

662
01:13:48,857 --> 01:13:50,859
Yes?

663
01:13:50,859 --> 01:13:53,862
Well, it's
about her clothing.

664
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:55,864
What is it, my dear?

665
01:13:55,864 --> 01:13:59,857
Well, I didn't know whether
the sergeant should be told.

666
01:14:00,869 --> 01:14:03,872
There's, there's no corset.

667
01:14:03,872 --> 01:14:07,876
Miss Irma's corset.
It's missing.

668
01:14:07,876 --> 01:14:09,878
You did right, my dear.

669
01:14:09,878 --> 01:14:13,871
It can't possibly be
of any interest.

flashing around a pigsty

on a place about a mile
from the rock.

677
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:55,913
There's some questions
got answers and some haven't.

678
01:15:00,929 --> 01:15:04,922
No. There'll be a solution
turn up directly, more'n likely.

679
01:15:08,937 --> 01:15:11,940
A kidnappin'.

680
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:15,933
Or, you know,
something like that.

681
01:15:18,947 --> 01:15:22,940
They might have
fallen down a hole.

682
01:15:25,954 --> 01:15:29,947
No, no. There's a solution
somewhere, all right.

683
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:33,962
There's gotta be.

That is correct.

692
01:16:37,025 --> 01:16:41,018
I have written several letters
to your guardian, Mr. Cosgrove, Sara,

693
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:46,023
but I have not been favored
with a reply thus far.

694
01:16:47,035 --> 01:16:51,028
In fact, it is all of six months
since I have received a letter

695
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:55,043
or a check.

696
01:16:55,043 --> 01:16:59,036
I, therefore, have no alternative
but to cancel all your extras.

697
01:17:00,048 --> 01:17:02,050
This means that,
as of today,

698
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:06,043
you can no longer partake
in dancing or drawing lessons.

699
01:17:07,055 --> 01:17:11,059
And unless all your outstanding
fees are paid by Easter,

700
01:17:11,059 --> 01:17:15,052
I'm afraid we shall have
to make other arrangements.

701
01:17:17,065 --> 01:17:21,058
You know what that means,
don't you, Sara?

702
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:27,075
You will have to go away.

703
01:17:27,075 --> 01:17:31,068
There are places for girls
in your predicament. Institutions.

704
01:17:39,087 --> 01:17:43,091

Are you feeling ill?

708
01:18:19,127 --> 01:18:23,120
People don't sit on cold steps in the
dark unless they're weak in the head.

709
01:18:27,135 --> 01:18:31,128

Go and wash for supper.

Well, you best
go straight to bed.

Tell Mademoiselle
I don't want it. Thank you.

714
01:19:03,171 --> 01:19:07,164
But you must eat.
You'll get sick if you don't.

715
01:19:08,176 --> 01:19:12,180
I'm sick already.
If I eat that, I'll be even sicker.

716
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:15,183
Nonsense.
Now come on, Miss Sara.

Do you know what, Minnie?

718
01:19:17,185 --> 01:19:20,188
No. What?

719
01:19:20,188 --> 01:19:23,191
I was in an orphanage once.

Were you, Sara?

721
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:34,191
I had a brother then...
called Bertie.

722
01:19:43,211 --> 01:19:47,204
I told the matron I wanted
to be a lady circus rider

723
01:19:48,216 --> 01:19:52,209
on a white horse
with a spangled dress.

724
01:19:54,222 --> 01:19:58,215
She was afraid I'd run away,
so she shaved my head.

725
01:20:01,229 --> 01:20:05,222
I bit her arm. It bled.

726
01:20:07,235 --> 01:20:11,228
So she painted my head
with gentian violet.

Why don't you tell us, Irma?
You know where they are!

813
01:30:44,872 --> 01:30:48,876
Just tell us, Irma!
Tell us!

814
01:30:48,876 --> 01:30:51,879
They're dead!
All dead and gone, Irma!

[All shouting at once]

01:30:54,882 --> 01:30:57,885
She's going to you know where!

817
01:30:57,885 --> 01:30:59,887
You are a liar and a fool!

821
01:31:28,916 --> 01:31:30,918
Mademoiselle?

822
01:31:30,918 --> 01:31:34,911
It's for her own good!
To cure her terrible stooping!

Have we an invalid
in the house?

01:33:14,021 --> 01:33:16,023
Miss Sara's supper, ma'am.

830
01:33:16,023 --> 01:33:19,026
Mademoiselle asked me, seeing
as the child's feeling poorly.

831
01:33:19,026 --> 01:33:22,029
Oh. Minnie!

832
01:33:22,029 --> 01:33:24,031
Hmm?

833
01:33:24,031 --> 01:33:28,035
Tell Miss Sara not to put her light out
until I've had a word with her.

01:33:28,035 --> 01:33:32,028
Yes, ma'am.

[Whispering]
This is not a charitable institution.

836
01:33:57,064 --> 01:34:01,057
You recall our recent
discussion, Sara.

837
01:34:03,070 --> 01:34:07,074
Answer me when
I address you, child.

838
01:34:07,074 --> 01:34:09,076
Yes.

839
01:34:09,076 --> 01:34:13,069
I have considered
your situation most carefully,

840
01:34:14,081 --> 01:34:18,085
and I have searched my mind
and my conscience for a solution.

841
01:34:18,085 --> 01:34:22,078
But this is not
a charitable institution.

842
01:34:23,090 --> 01:34:26,093
And as your fees
have not been forthcoming,

843
01:34:26,093 --> 01:34:30,086
I have been forced to make
certain arrangements on your behalf.

844
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:37,093
You will be returned
to the orphanage.

about that bloody rock?

848

I can't help it.

01:36:17,204 --> 01:36:21,208
It comes back
at night in dreams.

850
01:36:21,208 --> 01:36:24,211
I had a funny dream
last night.

851
01:36:24,211 --> 01:36:28,204
There was this smell.
Real strong.

852
01:36:29,216 --> 01:36:33,209
It was like, like I was wide awake.
Dead quiet.

853
01:36:34,221 --> 01:36:37,224
Pansies.
That's what it smelt like.

854
01:36:37,224 --> 01:36:41,217
And the whole place
was all lit up, bright as day.

855
01:36:43,230 --> 01:36:46,233
Pitch black outside.

856
01:36:46,233 --> 01:36:50,237
And there she is.

857
01:36:50,237 --> 01:36:52,239
Who was it?

858
01:36:52,239 --> 01:36:56,232
It was only a bloody dream!

859
01:36:57,244 --> 01:37:01,248
My kid sister. Haven't seen her
since the orphanage.

860
01:37:01,248 --> 01:37:05,252
She always liked pansies.

861
01:37:05,252 --> 01:37:09,245
And she went
all sort of... misty-like.

862
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:17,253
I calls out,
"Sara, don't go yet."

863
01:37:20,267 --> 01:37:23,270
"Good-bye, Bertie," she says.

864
01:37:23,270 --> 01:37:27,263
"I've come a long way to see ya,
and now I must go."

865
01:37:28,275 --> 01:37:31,278
And she went.

866
01:37:31,278 --> 01:37:35,271
Clear through that wall
over there.

867

[Chuckles]

868
01:37:43,290 --> 01:37:44,291
Sit down, please, Mademoiselle.

Merci.

870
01:37:46,293 --> 01:37:50,297
We were speaking last night
about the Waybourne girl.

871
01:37:50,297 --> 01:37:54,301
You expressed concern
over the state of her health.

872
01:37:54,301 --> 01:37:56,303
Yes, madame.

873
01:37:56,303 --> 01:37:59,306
We have been relieved
of any further responsibility.

874
01:37:59,306 --> 01:38:03,299
Her guardian, Mr. Cosgrove, arrived
this morning and took her away with him.

875
01:38:09,316 --> 01:38:13,309
That's... But was she
fit enough to travel?

876
01:38:14,321 --> 01:38:16,323
Apparently.

877
01:38:16,323 --> 01:38:19,326
I should have been here
to supervise her packing.

878
01:38:19,326 --> 01:38:22,329
I, myself, helped Sara
put a few things she especially wanted

879
01:38:22,329 --> 01:38:24,331
into her little covered basket.

880
01:38:24,331 --> 01:38:26,333
Mr. Cosgrove
was in a hurry to get away.

881
01:38:26,333 --> 01:38:29,336
I shall not be coming
into luncheon, Mademoiselle.

882
01:38:29,336 --> 01:38:31,338
Kindly tell them
not to lay a place for me.

883
01:38:31,338 --> 01:38:33,340
Nor for Sara?

884
01:38:33,340 --> 01:38:37,333
Nor for Sara.

01:38:40,347 --> 01:38:44,340
Is that rouge I see
on your cheek, Mademoiselle?

886
01:38:45,352 --> 01:38:49,345

Ever.
For 40 years.

The pier, the sands

And that guest house.

909
01:40:42,469 --> 01:40:45,472
So dependable.

910

I came to depend so much
on Greta McCraw.

916
01:41:14,501 --> 01:41:18,505
So much masculine intellect.

917
01:41:18,505 --> 01:41:21,508
I came to rely
on that woman.

918

Trust her.

919
01:41:23,510 --> 01:41:27,514
How could she allow herself
to be spirited away?

920

Lost.

Hanging Rock.

principal of Appleyard College,

on Friday the 27th of March, 1900.

Although the exact circumstances
of her death are not known,

01:43:41,648 --> 01:43:45,652
it is believed she fell while
attempting to climb the rock.

A search for the missing schoolgirls
and their governess

continued spasmodically
for the next few years without success.

To this day, their disappearance
remains a mystery.
