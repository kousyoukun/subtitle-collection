00:01:38,154 --> 00:01:40,281
What we see

3
00:01:41,358 --> 00:01:43,588
and what we seem

4
00:01:44,961 --> 00:01:47,225
are but a dream--

5
00:01:49,466 --> 00:01:51,400
a dream within a dream.

6
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:16,181
"Meet me, love,
when day is ending."

7
00:03:17,987 --> 00:03:21,718
"I love thee
for thy highborn grace,

8
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:24,692
thy deep and lustrous eyes,

9
00:03:24,761 --> 00:03:28,663
for the sweet meaning
of thy brow

10
00:03:28,732 --> 00:03:31,929
and for thy bearing
so high."

11
00:03:32,001 --> 00:03:34,231
Six

12
00:03:34,304 --> 00:03:36,238
and seven

13
00:03:37,273 --> 00:03:39,207
and eight

14
00:03:40,276 --> 00:03:42,540
and nine

15
00:03:42,612 --> 00:03:44,773
and ten

16
00:03:44,848 --> 00:03:46,782
and 11.

17
00:03:47,917 --> 00:03:51,853
"l love thee not because
thou art fair,

18
00:03:51,921 --> 00:03:56,415
softer than down,
smoother than air,

19
00:03:56,493 --> 00:03:59,360
nor for the cupids
that do lie

20
00:03:59,429 --> 00:04:02,762
in either corner
of thine eye.

21
00:04:02,832 --> 00:04:06,063
Wouldst thou then know
what it might be?

22
00:04:06,136 --> 00:04:10,038
'Tis I love thee
'cause thou lovest me."

23
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:13,002
See the little horse

24
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:16,698
My little horse

25
00:05:16,773 --> 00:05:19,298
Trotting down the paddock

26
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,935
On his fine white feet

27
00:05:22,011 --> 00:05:25,708
Black horse, white horse

28
00:05:25,782 --> 00:05:28,945
Brown horse, grey

29
00:05:29,018 --> 00:05:31,418
Trotting down the paddock

30
00:05:31,488 --> 00:05:34,946
On a bright, sunny day

31
00:05:37,093 --> 00:05:41,029
Someday, Sara, you shall have to come
home with me to the station--

32
00:05:41,097 --> 00:05:43,031
to Queensland--

33
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:47,798
and meet my sweet,
funny family for yourself.

34
00:05:47,871 --> 00:05:49,805
Would you like that?

35
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,540
You must learn to love
someone else

36
00:06:00,617 --> 00:06:03,950
apart from me, Sara.

37
00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:08,553
I won't be here
much longer.

38
00:06:15,698 --> 00:06:18,098
What do you think, Miranda?

39
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:21,102
Somebody had the nerve
to send Miss McCraw a card

40
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:24,333
on squared paper
covered with tiny sums.

41
00:06:28,611 --> 00:06:30,909
Girls! Girls!

42
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,039
Unless you all
deport yourselves

43
00:06:33,116 --> 00:06:35,880
with rather more grace
and considerably less noise,

44
00:06:35,952 --> 00:06:39,410
Mrs. Appleyard will see to it that
none of you go to Hanging Rock today.

45
00:06:39,489 --> 00:06:40,888
Bonjour, Miss Lumley.

46
00:06:40,957 --> 00:06:42,982
Good morning,
Mademoiselle de Poitiers.

47
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:51,764
I believe Mrs. Appleyard has decided
you're not to go on the picnic, Sara.

48
00:06:53,102 --> 00:06:55,593
That makes two of us.

49
00:06:56,973 --> 00:06:58,907
Off you go!

50
00:06:59,976 --> 00:07:01,910
To St. Valentine!

51
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,994
Frere Jacques
Frere Jacques

52
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:29,004
Dormez vous...

53
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:39,407
Tais-toi, lrma.
Miss McCraw vient d'arriver.

54
00:07:41,084 --> 00:07:43,143
She wants algebra today.

55
00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:45,653
Today?

56
00:08:15,051 --> 00:08:16,985
Good morning, girls.

57
00:08:17,053 --> 00:08:19,146
Good morning, Mrs. Appleyard.

58
00:08:19,222 --> 00:08:21,486
Well, young ladies, we are
indeed fortunate in the weather

59
00:08:21,557 --> 00:08:23,491
for our picnic to Hanging Rock.

60
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:26,619
I have instructed Mademoiselle that
as the day is likely to be warm,

61
00:08:26,696 --> 00:08:31,360
you may remove your gloves once
the drag has passed through Woodend.

62
00:08:31,434 --> 00:08:35,336
You will partake of luncheon
at the picnic grounds near the rock.

63
00:08:35,405 --> 00:08:40,433
Once again let me remind you that
the rock is extremely dangerous,

64
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,536
and you are therefore forbidden
any tomboy foolishness

65
00:08:43,613 --> 00:08:47,071
in the matter of exploration,
even on the lower slopes.

66
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:51,484
I also wish to remind you, the vicinity
is renowned for its venomous snakes

67
00:08:51,554 --> 00:08:53,784
and poisonous ants
of various species.

68
00:08:53,856 --> 00:08:57,257
It is, however,
a geological marvel

69
00:08:57,326 --> 00:09:01,524
on which you will be required to write
a brief essay on Monday morning.

70
00:09:01,597 --> 00:09:04,532
That is all.
Have a pleasant day,

71
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,263
and try to behave yourselves in a manner
to bring credit to the college.

72
00:09:08,337 --> 00:09:11,170
Mr. Hussey! Mr. Hussey!

73
00:09:13,409 --> 00:09:16,435
I shall expect you back,
Miss McCraw and Mademoiselle,

74
00:09:16,512 --> 00:09:18,537
at about 8:00
for a light supper.

75
00:09:18,614 --> 00:09:20,548
Come, girls.

76
00:09:22,251 --> 00:09:24,185
Whoa!

77
00:09:51,247 --> 00:09:53,875
This we do for pleasure

78
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:56,748
so that we may shortly
be at the mercy

79
00:09:56,819 --> 00:09:59,219
of venomous snakes
and poisonous ants.

80
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:03,491
How foolish
can human creatures be?

81
00:10:58,881 --> 00:11:01,406
There she is, ladies.
Hangin' Rock.

82
00:11:05,188 --> 00:11:07,850
The mountain comes to Mohammed.

83
00:11:07,924 --> 00:11:10,358
A hanging rock
comes to Mr. Hussey.

84
00:11:12,161 --> 00:11:14,652
More than 500 feet high
she is.

85
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:18,393
Volcanic, of course.
Thousands of years old.

86
00:11:18,467 --> 00:11:22,301
A million years old,
Mr. Hussey, or thereabouts.

87
00:11:22,371 --> 00:11:25,670
Yes, well,
that'd be right.

88
00:11:25,741 --> 00:11:28,266
Thousands, millions.

89
00:11:28,344 --> 00:11:32,337
Devil of a long time, anyway,
in a manner of speakin'.

90
00:11:32,415 --> 00:11:37,148
Only a million years ago.
Quite a recent eruption, really.

91
00:11:38,821 --> 00:11:42,621
The rocks all around
Mount Macedon itself

92
00:11:42,692 --> 00:11:45,786
must be all of
350 million years old.

93
00:11:48,331 --> 00:11:54,031
Siliceous lava forced up
from deep down below.

94
00:11:55,671 --> 00:11:57,901
Soda trachytes

95
00:11:57,974 --> 00:12:02,604
extruded in a highly
viscous state,

96
00:12:02,678 --> 00:12:06,580
building the steep-sided mountains
we see in Hanging Rock.

97
00:12:08,517 --> 00:12:12,977
And quite young, geologically speaking.
Barely a million years.

98
00:12:14,557 --> 00:12:18,584
Waiting a million years
just for us.

99
00:12:48,324 --> 00:12:51,589
More cake, Michael?

100
00:12:51,661 --> 00:12:54,755
No, thank you,
Aunt. I'm--

101
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,094
I think I'll just, um,
stretch my legs a bit.

102
00:12:57,166 --> 00:13:00,693
Oh, don't go too far
and be careful.

103
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,261
There could be snakes.

104
00:13:38,641 --> 00:13:40,575
How's it goin'?

105
00:13:40,643 --> 00:13:42,907
All right.

106
00:13:42,979 --> 00:13:45,277
They finished eating,
have they?

107
00:13:47,316 --> 00:13:49,250
Eh?

108
00:13:49,318 --> 00:13:52,810
The colonel and the missus--
they finished eating, have they?

109
00:13:52,888 --> 00:13:55,186
Oh, yes, they have.

110
00:13:56,325 --> 00:13:58,691
Expect me up there
in a minute, I suppose.

111
00:13:58,761 --> 00:14:00,695
Clear away.

112
00:14:05,935 --> 00:14:08,631
Can't be more'n midday.

113
00:14:08,704 --> 00:14:10,137
No.

114
00:14:13,242 --> 00:14:16,507
I thought it was a little
early for lunch myself.

115
00:14:16,579 --> 00:14:18,513
Yes.

116
00:14:20,316 --> 00:14:22,250
Drink?

117
00:14:22,318 --> 00:14:24,252
Thank you.

118
00:14:29,058 --> 00:14:33,256
You know, they always allow an hour
longer than it takes to get 'ere,

119
00:14:33,329 --> 00:14:36,560
and then they got 'ere
straight away.

120
00:14:36,632 --> 00:14:38,964
Thanks.

121
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:48,469
Ah.

122
00:14:48,544 --> 00:14:51,206
Not that they got
anything else to do.

123
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,272
I mean, they never
go for a walk or nothin'.

124
00:15:08,831 --> 00:15:11,527
Get on!

125
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,033
Come on!

126
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:30,942
Take your hats.
Let's go walk about now.

127
00:15:54,009 --> 00:15:55,943
To St. Valentine!

128
00:15:56,011 --> 00:15:58,639
To St. Valentine!

129
00:16:19,034 --> 00:16:22,299
I hope you have learned
your poetry, Sara.

130
00:16:22,371 --> 00:16:25,135
Sit up straight, child.
Hold your shoulders back.

131
00:16:25,207 --> 00:16:27,300
You're getting
a dreadful stoop.

132
00:16:27,376 --> 00:16:30,903
Well, have you got
your lines by heart?

133
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,540
Well, have you?

134
00:16:33,616 --> 00:16:36,551
I can't.
It doesn't make sense.

135
00:16:36,619 --> 00:16:39,554
Sense!
You little ignoramus!

136
00:16:39,622 --> 00:16:42,557
Evidently you don't know
that Mrs. Felicia Heymans

137
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:45,685
is considered one of the finest
of our English poets.

138
00:16:47,396 --> 00:16:50,331
I know another piece
of poetry by heart.

139
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,960
It has ever so many verses, much more
than "The Wreck of the Hesperus."

140
00:16:54,036 --> 00:16:55,333
Would that do?

141
00:16:55,404 --> 00:16:57,338
What is the name
of this poem?

142
00:16:57,406 --> 00:16:59,340
"An Ode to St. Valentine."

143
00:16:59,408 --> 00:17:02,172
I'm not acquainted with it.
Where did you find it?

144
00:17:02,244 --> 00:17:04,678
I didn't find it.
I wrote it.

145
00:17:04,747 --> 00:17:06,681
You wrote it?

146
00:17:08,184 --> 00:17:10,812
"Love abounds,
love surrounds--"

147
00:17:10,886 --> 00:17:12,444
Oh, no thank you, Sara.

148
00:17:12,521 --> 00:17:16,651
Strange as it may seem,
I still prefer Mrs. Heymans.

149
00:17:16,725 --> 00:17:20,889
Give me your book and proceed
to recite to me as far as you have gone.

150
00:17:20,963 --> 00:17:23,056
Your book, please, Sara.

151
00:17:25,034 --> 00:17:27,229
Thank you.

152
00:17:27,303 --> 00:17:29,863
Go on.

153
00:17:29,939 --> 00:17:32,305
I can't.

154
00:17:32,374 --> 00:17:34,308
Not one line?

155
00:17:37,012 --> 00:17:39,276
I shall leave you now, Sara.

156
00:17:39,348 --> 00:17:43,546
I expect you to be word perfect when
I send Miss Lumley in in half an hour.

157
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:46,452
Otherwise, I'm afraid
I shall have to send you to bed

158
00:17:46,522 --> 00:17:50,151
instead of letting you stay up
until the others return from the picnic.

159
00:18:03,572 --> 00:18:07,406
Bertie! Bertie!

160
00:18:09,044 --> 00:18:11,706
Jesus, where are you?

161
00:18:13,315 --> 00:18:15,249
Oh, Miranda!

162
00:18:24,026 --> 00:18:27,086
I like this one.

163
00:18:27,162 --> 00:18:31,155
"Shall I compare thee
to a summer's day?

164
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:35,932
Thou art more lovely
and more temperate.

165
00:18:36,005 --> 00:18:39,941
Rough winds do shake
the darling buds of May,

166
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:44,241
And summer's lease
hath all too short a date."

167
00:18:49,518 --> 00:18:52,453
That's funny!

168
00:18:52,521 --> 00:18:55,046
Blowed if me watch
hasn't stopped.

169
00:18:57,459 --> 00:19:00,223
Dead on 12:00.

170
00:19:03,832 --> 00:19:05,766
Real funny.

171
00:19:08,037 --> 00:19:11,029
C'est tres jolie,
n'est-ce pas?

172
00:19:12,308 --> 00:19:15,334
Uh, you wouldn't have
the time, I suppose, miss?

173
00:19:18,714 --> 00:19:22,445
Ah, Miranda, your pretty
little diamond watch.

174
00:19:22,518 --> 00:19:24,543
Don't wear it anymore.

175
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,781
Can't stand the ticking
above my heart.

176
00:19:26,855 --> 00:19:27,844
Ah.

177
00:19:29,758 --> 00:19:33,489
If it were mine,
I'd wear it always.

178
00:19:33,562 --> 00:19:35,496
Even in the bath.

179
00:19:35,564 --> 00:19:38,362
Would you, Mr. Hussey?

180
00:19:43,372 --> 00:19:46,307
Stopped at 12:00.

181
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:50,835
Never stopped before.
Must be something magnetic.

182
00:19:50,913 --> 00:19:54,144
Well after 2:00, I'd say.

183
00:19:54,216 --> 00:19:58,016
We'd better be careful.
I promised Mrs. Appleyard

184
00:19:58,087 --> 00:20:01,682
I'd have you lot
back at the college by 8:00.

185
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,854
Except for those people
down there,

186
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:11,593
we might be the only living
creatures in the whole world.

187
00:20:27,349 --> 00:20:28,816
Excuse me, Mademoiselle.

188
00:20:28,884 --> 00:20:30,749
Yes, Marion?

189
00:20:30,819 --> 00:20:33,811
I should like to make a few measurements
of the rock if we have time.

190
00:20:33,889 --> 00:20:36,414
With Miranda and lrma.

191
00:20:39,461 --> 00:20:43,727
Please, Mademoiselle.
We'll be back long before tea.

192
00:20:46,168 --> 00:20:48,398
Et bien. Allez!

193
00:20:49,838 --> 00:20:52,398
May I come too, please?

194
00:20:52,474 --> 00:20:54,567
So long as
you don't complain.

195
00:20:54,643 --> 00:20:56,406
I won't.
I promise.

196
00:20:56,478 --> 00:20:58,810
And don't worry
about us, Mademoiselle.

197
00:20:58,881 --> 00:21:01,748
We shall only be gone
a little while.

198
00:21:18,434 --> 00:21:20,368
Ah.

199
00:21:23,105 --> 00:21:25,039
Now I know.

200
00:21:26,108 --> 00:21:28,542
What do you know?

201
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:34,011
I know that Miranda
is a Botticelli angel.

202
00:21:59,141 --> 00:22:01,109
Wait!

203
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,984
Can you manage it, Edith?

204
00:22:14,056 --> 00:22:15,819
I don't know.

205
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:20,660
I don't want to get
my feet wet.

206
00:22:26,401 --> 00:22:27,493
Oh!

207
00:22:34,576 --> 00:22:37,670
Thought the little fat one
was gonna take a bath.

208
00:22:41,717 --> 00:22:44,413
Some of them
are real lookers.

209
00:22:44,486 --> 00:22:47,819
Have a look at the shape
of the dark one with the curls.

210
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:50,859
Built like an hourglass.

211
00:22:53,395 --> 00:22:57,092
And 'ave a go at the last one!
The blonde!

212
00:22:57,165 --> 00:23:01,192
Oh, she'd have
a decent pair of legs.

213
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,431
All the way up to her bum.

214
00:23:03,505 --> 00:23:07,441
I'd rather you didn't say
crude things like that.

215
00:23:07,509 --> 00:23:12,003
Oh, I say the crude things.
You just think 'em.

216
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,378
Miranda!

217
00:23:14,449 --> 00:23:16,383
Take my word for it.

218
00:23:16,451 --> 00:23:19,545
The sheilas are all alike
when it comes to fellas.

219
00:23:19,621 --> 00:23:22,715
Doesn't matter if it's
a bloody college you come from

220
00:23:22,791 --> 00:23:26,727
or the Ballarat Orphanage where
me and me kid sister was dragged up.

221
00:23:26,795 --> 00:23:29,730
I didn't know
you were an orphan.

222
00:23:29,798 --> 00:23:34,394
Geez. I haven't thought of that
bloody dump in donkeys' years.

223
00:23:49,518 --> 00:23:51,645
Miranda!

224
00:24:00,862 --> 00:24:04,628
I think I'll just, uh,
stretch my legs a bit before we go.

225
00:25:17,706 --> 00:25:19,139
Look!

226
00:25:21,009 --> 00:25:25,070
Not down at the ground, Edith.
Way up there in the sky.

227
00:26:56,671 --> 00:26:59,105
Why can't we just
sit on this log

228
00:26:59,174 --> 00:27:02,109
and look at the ugly
old rock from here?

229
00:27:04,379 --> 00:27:06,313
It's nasty here!

230
00:27:06,381 --> 00:27:08,849
I never thought
it would be so nasty,

231
00:27:08,917 --> 00:27:10,942
or I wouldn't have come!

232
00:28:10,111 --> 00:28:12,978
We can't go much further.

233
00:28:13,048 --> 00:28:15,107
We promised Mademoiselle

234
00:28:16,985 --> 00:28:19,351
we wouldn't be long away.

235
00:28:37,272 --> 00:28:40,435
If only we could
stay out all night

236
00:28:40,508 --> 00:28:42,601
and watch the moon rise.

237
00:28:44,045 --> 00:28:47,674
Blanche said Sara writes poetry
in the dunny!

238
00:28:47,749 --> 00:28:52,516
She found one there on the floor
all about Miranda.

239
00:28:52,587 --> 00:28:54,953
She's an orphan.

240
00:29:01,096 --> 00:29:05,863
Sara reminds me of a little deer
Papa brought home once.

241
00:29:07,335 --> 00:29:11,294
I looked after it,
but it died.

242
00:29:14,209 --> 00:29:16,234
Mama always said
it was doomed.

243
00:29:18,613 --> 00:29:21,741
Doomed?
What's that mean, lrma?

244
00:29:21,816 --> 00:29:24,410
Doomed to die, of course.

245
00:29:24,486 --> 00:29:26,886
"The boy stood
on the burning deck,

246
00:29:26,955 --> 00:29:29,480
whence all but he had fled,
tra la--"

247
00:29:29,557 --> 00:29:32,048
I forget the rest.

248
00:29:32,127 --> 00:29:37,690
I think I must be doomed.
I don't feel at all well.

249
00:29:37,766 --> 00:29:41,759
I do wish you'd stop
talking for once.

250
00:29:41,836 --> 00:29:46,296
Poor Edith.
We'll go back soon.

251
00:31:05,053 --> 00:31:08,147
Irma! Look at them!

252
00:31:10,925 --> 00:31:14,361
Where in the world
are they going?

253
00:31:14,429 --> 00:31:16,920
Without their shoes!

254
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,496
Irma, wait!
Wait for me!

255
00:31:21,569 --> 00:31:24,834
Please wait!
Wait, lrma, wait!

256
00:31:32,514 --> 00:31:35,642
Whatever can those people
be doing down there?

257
00:31:35,717 --> 00:31:39,380
Like a lot of ants.

258
00:31:39,454 --> 00:31:44,391
Surprising the number
of human beings are without purpose.

259
00:31:44,459 --> 00:31:46,723
Although it is probable

260
00:31:46,795 --> 00:31:51,391
they're performing some function
unknown to themselves.

261
00:32:03,411 --> 00:32:08,348
Everything begins and ends

262
00:32:08,416 --> 00:32:11,544
at exactly the right time

263
00:32:11,619 --> 00:32:13,587
and place.

264
00:32:14,656 --> 00:32:15,588
Look!

265
00:34:13,675 --> 00:34:17,133
Miranda, I feel awful,

266
00:34:17,212 --> 00:34:19,009
really awful.

267
00:34:20,081 --> 00:34:22,208
Oh.

268
00:34:22,283 --> 00:34:25,309
Miranda, I feel
perfectly awful.

269
00:34:25,386 --> 00:34:27,980
When are we going home?

270
00:34:31,092 --> 00:34:32,957
When are we going home?

271
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,892
Miranda?

272
00:34:43,638 --> 00:34:45,572
Miranda!

273
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:51,403
Miranda!

274
00:34:51,479 --> 00:34:55,245
Miranda, don't go up there!
Come back!

275
00:35:30,151 --> 00:35:32,381
I've gotta go.
That's Mrs. Appleyard.

276
00:35:32,453 --> 00:35:34,045
Let someone else go.

277
00:35:34,122 --> 00:35:36,590
They won't.
No. I'm on.

278
00:35:36,658 --> 00:35:38,592
What time is it?

279
00:35:46,034 --> 00:35:48,127
What've you got to do?

280
00:35:51,406 --> 00:35:53,636
Mrs. Appleyard'll skin me.

281
00:35:53,708 --> 00:35:55,938
We got plenty of time.

282
00:36:06,554 --> 00:36:08,488
You'd better go.

283
00:36:37,552 --> 00:36:40,020
Why are they so late?

284
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:11,578
God be praised!

285
00:37:22,864 --> 00:37:25,799
Mademoiselle,
why are you so late?

286
00:37:25,867 --> 00:37:30,236
Madame, something terrible
has happened.

287
00:37:30,304 --> 00:37:33,705
What? What do you mean?

288
00:37:33,775 --> 00:37:35,572
I can't--

289
00:37:35,643 --> 00:37:39,079
And where in heaven's name
is Miss McCraw?

290
00:37:39,147 --> 00:37:41,911
We left her behind
at the rock.

291
00:37:41,983 --> 00:37:43,917
You left her behind?

292
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,421
Has everyone taken leave
of their senses?

293
00:37:48,489 --> 00:37:51,822
Miss Lumley, get these girls
to bed immediately.

294
00:37:51,893 --> 00:37:55,329
And Cook, Cook!
Hot soup, please, for all of them.

295
00:37:57,498 --> 00:38:00,831
Mrs. Appleyard, l-l must
speak to you alone.

296
00:38:00,902 --> 00:38:02,369
Very well.

297
00:38:10,077 --> 00:38:13,843
Straight up the stairs, girls.
Come along, quickly as you can.

298
00:38:13,915 --> 00:38:16,281
Cook, I asked you for hot soup!

299
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:33,629
Well, ma'am, ma'am,
the strength of it is this.

300
00:38:36,571 --> 00:38:39,870
Three of your young ladies

301
00:38:39,941 --> 00:38:42,910
and Miss McCraw

302
00:38:44,412 --> 00:38:48,178
are m-missing on the rock.

303
00:38:50,852 --> 00:38:52,285
What happened?

304
00:38:54,689 --> 00:38:57,624
Well, now, Mrs. Appleyard,

305
00:38:57,692 --> 00:39:00,786
that's just the trouble.

306
00:39:00,862 --> 00:39:03,660
Nobody knows what happened.

307
00:39:06,367 --> 00:39:10,030
How soon after the girls
did Miss McCraw leave?

308
00:39:10,104 --> 00:39:13,631
Don't know.
No one knows.

309
00:39:14,909 --> 00:39:17,673
No one saw her leave.
We were asleep.

310
00:39:20,882 --> 00:39:23,009
And the little one?

311
00:39:23,084 --> 00:39:25,177
Edith Horton.

312
00:39:27,288 --> 00:39:29,984
Like I told you,

313
00:39:30,057 --> 00:39:32,548
she come tearin'
out of the bushes,

314
00:39:32,627 --> 00:39:35,323
dress all torn,

315
00:39:35,396 --> 00:39:38,695
screamin' fit to--

316
00:39:40,268 --> 00:39:43,533
Well, after we'd shooshed her screamin',
all we could get out of her

317
00:39:43,604 --> 00:39:47,540
was that she'd left the other
three somewhere up on the rock.

318
00:39:52,113 --> 00:39:54,877
That's about all
I can tell ya.

319
00:40:00,488 --> 00:40:03,651
Miranda! Miranda!

320
00:40:07,895 --> 00:40:09,829
Marion!

321
00:40:12,333 --> 00:40:13,766
Marion!

322
00:40:43,431 --> 00:40:45,365
Go on, get out of here.

323
00:40:48,402 --> 00:40:50,632
Ah, stop it !

324
00:40:53,374 --> 00:40:55,308
Come on.

325
00:40:58,012 --> 00:41:00,446
Miranda!

326
00:41:16,631 --> 00:41:19,600
Try to remember, Edith,

327
00:41:23,471 --> 00:41:26,702
what it was that
frightened you on the rock.

328
00:41:30,911 --> 00:41:33,675
Think carefully, darling.
Carefully!

329
00:41:35,049 --> 00:41:37,984
Did you speak to anyone?

330
00:41:39,086 --> 00:41:41,520
There must have been
something.

331
00:41:43,157 --> 00:41:44,681
Was there a man?

332
00:41:51,699 --> 00:41:54,964
Her legs were quite
severely scratched.

333
00:41:55,036 --> 00:41:58,005
From running through the brambles,
I should imagine.

334
00:42:02,476 --> 00:42:04,410
Nothing else?

335
00:42:08,783 --> 00:42:11,149
Nothing I could detect.

336
00:42:18,059 --> 00:42:21,517
She hadn't been...
molested?

337
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:25,597
No, no, nothing like that.

338
00:42:25,666 --> 00:42:30,262
I have examined her.
She is quite intact.

339
00:42:43,117 --> 00:42:46,052
Since you won't tell me
all the details,

340
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:49,214
how can I give you
an opinion, Lionel?

341
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:51,417
There are no details.

342
00:42:51,492 --> 00:42:54,086
People just don't
disappear, my dear.

343
00:42:54,161 --> 00:42:56,459
Not without good reason.

344
00:42:58,132 --> 00:43:00,066
There's talk, is there?

345
00:43:00,134 --> 00:43:04,070
Not just gossip.
People have...theories.

346
00:43:04,138 --> 00:43:06,436
Go on.

347
00:43:06,507 --> 00:43:09,408
Well, it couldn't be local.

348
00:43:09,477 --> 00:43:11,570
Why couldn't it?

349
00:43:11,645 --> 00:43:15,706
No one around here
would do a thing like that.

350
00:43:15,783 --> 00:43:19,412
I've just told you, I simply noticed
three young ladies crossing the creek.

351
00:43:19,487 --> 00:43:21,853
What did they look like?

352
00:43:24,225 --> 00:43:26,591
The girls.
Describe them to me.

353
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:31,597
the first one
was tall and dark.

354
00:43:35,069 --> 00:43:38,004
Um, then there was
the little dumpy one,

355
00:43:38,072 --> 00:43:40,973
then the girl
with the glasses,

356
00:43:41,041 --> 00:43:44,909
and the last one
was slim and fair.

357
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,971
That's four.

358
00:43:50,885 --> 00:43:52,819
Pardon?

359
00:43:52,887 --> 00:43:55,947
A few minutes ago you said
there was only three of them.

360
00:43:56,023 --> 00:43:58,491
Oh-Oh, ye--

361
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:02,290
That's because the dumpy one
was back a little.

362
00:44:02,363 --> 00:44:06,094
And then they moved off
into the trees

363
00:44:06,167 --> 00:44:09,261
and that's the last
we saw of them.

364
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:15,668
Perhaps we could go
a little higher.

365
00:44:17,411 --> 00:44:19,345
I was tired.

366
00:44:20,714 --> 00:44:22,978
I sat down on a log.

367
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:25,484
Which log, Edith?
This one?

368
00:44:25,553 --> 00:44:29,216
Look around you, darling.
Maybe you can see it now.

369
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:31,724
Is that the one?
You went that way?

370
00:44:31,792 --> 00:44:33,726
I don't know.

371
00:44:33,794 --> 00:44:37,662
I was tired.
I'm tired now.

372
00:44:43,871 --> 00:44:46,101
There is one thing
I remember.

373
00:44:46,173 --> 00:44:48,573
What do you remember,
Edith? Tell us.

374
00:44:48,642 --> 00:44:50,769
It was when
I was coming down,

375
00:44:50,845 --> 00:44:53,245
when I was running.

376
00:44:53,314 --> 00:44:55,373
It was a cloud.

377
00:44:55,449 --> 00:44:57,747
What sort of a cloud?

378
00:44:57,818 --> 00:45:00,719
It was red.

379
00:45:00,788 --> 00:45:04,690
I remember it clearly.
It was just after I passed Miss McCraw.

380
00:45:06,994 --> 00:45:08,928
Who did you say you saw?

381
00:45:08,996 --> 00:45:10,861
Miss McCraw.

382
00:45:10,931 --> 00:45:14,264
She was going up the hill
as I was going down.

383
00:45:14,335 --> 00:45:17,600
Did she stop?
Did you speak?

384
00:45:17,671 --> 00:45:20,333
No. She was too far away.

385
00:45:20,407 --> 00:45:24,605
She was about as far away
as those dead trees are over there.

386
00:45:29,016 --> 00:45:31,177
She was funny.

387
00:45:31,252 --> 00:45:33,743
Funny?

388
00:45:33,821 --> 00:45:35,948
How?

389
00:45:36,023 --> 00:45:38,116
I'd rather not say.

390
00:45:38,192 --> 00:45:42,458
You must, Edith.
It could be very important.

391
00:45:42,529 --> 00:45:44,463
It's rude.

392
00:45:56,410 --> 00:45:58,640
Les pantalons.

393
00:45:58,712 --> 00:46:02,773
She had no skirt.
Just les pantalons.

394
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:08,288
Drawers ? You mean she was
just wearing drawers?

395
00:46:48,329 --> 00:46:50,263
One last go

396
00:46:51,832 --> 00:46:53,766
for the bloodhound.

397
00:47:00,507 --> 00:47:01,940
Miranda.

398
00:48:05,472 --> 00:48:08,498
Why didn't you tell us
you followed the four girls?

399
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:12,044
Because...

400
00:48:14,581 --> 00:48:16,640
I didn't exactly follow them.

401
00:48:16,717 --> 00:48:19,550
I just jumped across the creek

402
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:22,282
and walked towards the rock
for a little way.

403
00:48:24,358 --> 00:48:26,292
I was curious.

404
00:48:29,663 --> 00:48:34,896
In England, young ladies like that
wouldn't be allowed to go walking.

405
00:48:34,968 --> 00:48:37,903
Not alone, anyway.

406
00:48:37,971 --> 00:48:42,340
But they'd gone by the time I came out
of the trees, so I turned back.

407
00:48:48,282 --> 00:48:52,309
As the girls
were jumping the creek,

408
00:48:54,688 --> 00:48:56,622
what were you thinking of?

409
00:49:29,239 --> 00:49:31,158
Ah, Michael.

410
00:50:11,698 --> 00:50:13,617
Oh, Michael!

411
00:50:37,224 --> 00:50:40,685
The old man hired me
to look after the horses.

412
00:50:40,769 --> 00:50:43,522
I'm buggered if I'm gonna be
a lackey at a bloody garden party.

413
00:50:45,857 --> 00:50:48,777
That's what
I bloody well told 'im.

414
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:50,779
More or less.

415
00:51:03,083 --> 00:51:06,044
Had the bloodhound out
the other day.

416
00:51:13,301 --> 00:51:15,428
I wake up every night
in a cold sweat.

417
00:51:17,347 --> 00:51:20,392
Just wondering
if they're still alive.

418
00:51:20,392 --> 00:51:23,395
Yeah, well, the way
I look at it is this:

419
00:51:23,478 --> 00:51:26,648
If the bloody cop and
the bloody abo tracker

420
00:51:26,731 --> 00:51:30,652
and the bloody dog can't find 'em,
well, no one bloody can.

421
00:51:31,945 --> 00:51:34,114
People have been bushed
before today,

422
00:51:34,197 --> 00:51:36,825
and as far as I'm concerned,
that's the stone end of it.

423
00:51:36,908 --> 00:51:39,452
Well, it's not the end of it
as far as I'm concerned.

424
00:51:41,788 --> 00:51:44,749
They may be out there
dying of thirst on--

425
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:49,629
on that infernal rock and...

426
00:51:49,713 --> 00:51:52,632
you and I are sitting here
drinking cold bloody beer.

427
00:51:57,471 --> 00:51:59,973
That's where
you and me's different.

428
00:52:05,312 --> 00:52:08,773
If you want my advice, the sooner
you forget the whole thing, the better.

429
00:52:08,857 --> 00:52:12,152
Well, I can't forget it,
and I never will.

430
00:52:21,411 --> 00:52:23,830
I'm not great shakes
on music,

431
00:52:23,872 --> 00:52:26,917
but I reckon the governor
must be leavin', eh?

432
00:52:28,835 --> 00:52:31,254
Your aunt'll give you hell
if you're not on show.

433
00:52:31,338 --> 00:52:33,673
Albert.

434
00:52:33,757 --> 00:52:36,218
I want to go back
to the rock.

435
00:52:40,013 --> 00:52:41,973
To look for them.

436
00:52:44,184 --> 00:52:46,269
Will you come with me?

437
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:03,286
Beautiful birds, them swans.

438
00:53:06,623 --> 00:53:08,875
A week in the bush,

439
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:11,962
they'd be dead by now.

440
00:53:15,257 --> 00:53:17,175
Then I'll go alone.

441
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:40,842
Coo-ee!

442
00:55:28,849 --> 00:55:30,267
Albert!

443
00:55:31,852 --> 00:55:33,270
Hello?

444
00:55:43,029 --> 00:55:45,282
Coo-ee!

445
00:55:49,536 --> 00:55:52,456
Mike!

446
00:55:53,707 --> 00:55:56,668
Michael!

447
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:12,767
Michael!

448
00:56:25,906 --> 00:56:28,492
We'll have
to be goin' soon.

449
00:56:28,575 --> 00:56:31,328
Dark before we get back.

450
00:56:31,411 --> 00:56:33,621
I'm staying here.

451
00:56:33,705 --> 00:56:35,624
You're what?

452
00:56:37,125 --> 00:56:39,044
I'm staying here.

453
00:56:39,127 --> 00:56:41,046
Here? On the rock?

454
00:56:41,129 --> 00:56:42,756
Yes.

455
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:47,177
What the hell for?
You're mad.

456
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:50,305
Yes, perhaps I am. But I'm still
staying, because somebody has to.

457
00:56:50,388 --> 00:56:52,349
Just because
you lot are Australians--

458
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:53,642
You're a funny bugger.

459
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:59,856
Well, what the hell am I gonna tell 'em
when I get back there without ya?

460
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:02,150
You can tell 'em
what you like.

461
00:57:04,903 --> 00:57:08,323
What? Woodend?

462
00:57:08,365 --> 00:57:10,325
The Victoria, sir.

463
00:57:10,367 --> 00:57:13,745
The little pub
near the corner.

464
00:57:13,787 --> 00:57:18,166
Mr. Michael's pretty knocked up, sir.
He's sleepin' there.

465
00:57:20,252 --> 00:57:22,462
The pub.

466
00:57:22,546 --> 00:57:25,423
Yeah. Yeah.

467
00:57:25,507 --> 00:57:28,176
I'm dashed if I know
how his aunt will take it.

468
00:57:31,138 --> 00:57:32,472
Yeah.

469
00:57:40,981 --> 00:57:42,983
All right.
Carry on, Crundall.

470
00:57:43,066 --> 00:57:44,985
Thank you, sir.

471
01:00:05,876 --> 01:00:08,044
Stopped at twelve.

472
01:00:08,128 --> 01:00:10,046
Never stopped before.

473
01:00:11,465 --> 01:00:15,469
Everything begins and ends

474
01:00:17,179 --> 01:00:19,222
at exactly the right time.

475
01:00:19,264 --> 01:00:22,893
Waiting a million years just for us.

476
01:00:22,934 --> 01:00:26,229
Look! Way up there in the sky!

477
01:00:26,271 --> 01:00:28,231
Now I know!

478
01:00:28,273 --> 01:00:30,567
What do you know?

479
01:00:30,609 --> 01:00:33,195
Surprising the number of human beings

480
01:00:33,236 --> 01:00:35,947
are without purpose.

481
01:00:36,031 --> 01:00:37,908
Although it is probable

482
01:00:37,949 --> 01:00:40,952
they are performing some function
unknown to themselves.

483
01:00:40,994 --> 01:00:46,249
Everything begins and ends

484
01:00:46,333 --> 01:00:51,171
at exactly the right time
and place.

485
01:01:00,722 --> 01:01:02,641
Miranda.

486
01:01:12,692 --> 01:01:14,653
Miranda!

487
01:01:18,281 --> 01:01:20,200
Miranda!

488
01:01:24,704 --> 01:01:26,665
Miranda!

489
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:11,001
Coo-ee!

490
01:02:15,714 --> 01:02:17,632
Coo-ee!

491
01:02:20,802 --> 01:02:22,929
Coo-ee!

492
01:02:26,016 --> 01:02:28,602
Coo-ee!

493
01:02:30,479 --> 01:02:32,522
Coo-ee!

494
01:03:40,549 --> 01:03:42,551
Let me have him now, son.

495
01:03:42,634 --> 01:03:46,054
I've had 30 years experience
puttin' them in

496
01:03:46,096 --> 01:03:49,266
so they don't fall out
back on the road.

497
01:03:56,273 --> 01:03:58,650
Eh, take her quietly, Sergeant.

498
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:48,051
Oh, Jesus. Jesus.

499
01:06:00,272 --> 01:06:02,482
Help me!

500
01:06:14,161 --> 01:06:16,121
Help me!

501
01:06:20,375 --> 01:06:22,294
Mademoiselle, they found lrma.

502
01:06:22,377 --> 01:06:23,503
What did you say?

503
01:06:23,587 --> 01:06:25,755
They found lrma,
and she's still alive.

504
01:06:27,632 --> 01:06:29,551
Oh--

505
01:06:33,054 --> 01:06:35,265
No one else?

506
01:06:35,348 --> 01:06:36,766
No.

507
01:06:53,116 --> 01:06:56,620
Now go home.
There's nothing you can do.

508
01:07:00,332 --> 01:07:03,710
Go on, now. Go home!
This is a police matter.

509
01:07:09,216 --> 01:07:11,134
Well, go on.

510
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:28,985
We've got a bloody right to know.

511
01:07:29,069 --> 01:07:31,363
We'd like to know
what's going on.

512
01:07:31,446 --> 01:07:34,449
He's right.

513
01:07:34,533 --> 01:07:38,829
We simply want something
done about it.

514
01:07:38,870 --> 01:07:40,831
Where's Bumpher?

515
01:07:43,542 --> 01:07:46,711
What we should do is go
to the bloody rock ourselves.

516
01:07:48,630 --> 01:07:50,882
We've got our own
self-respect to think about.

517
01:07:50,966 --> 01:07:54,719
He's right, there.
Get Bumpher out here. Come on.

518
01:07:54,803 --> 01:07:56,721
Come out, Bumpher!

519
01:07:59,724 --> 01:08:01,601
Go back.

520
01:08:01,685 --> 01:08:05,605
Go on. Go home.
The bloody lot of you.

521
01:08:05,689 --> 01:08:07,691
Nothing you can do.

522
01:08:18,702 --> 01:08:20,620
We can thank the Lord

523
01:08:20,704 --> 01:08:23,957
for this merciful deliverance
of our dear classmate lrma

524
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:26,376
and pray that Marion
and Miranda

525
01:08:26,418 --> 01:08:29,754
and our beloved Miss McCraw
will be likewise spared.

526
01:08:29,838 --> 01:08:32,883
It has been seen fit
that lrma should convalesce

527
01:08:32,966 --> 01:08:36,219
at the home of Colonel Fitzhubert
in Mount Macedon.

528
01:08:36,303 --> 01:08:39,431
Although you'll be delighted
at these good tidings,

529
01:08:39,514 --> 01:08:41,933
I would ask you
to remember, please,

530
01:08:41,975 --> 01:08:43,935
that of the three remaining
lost members of the party,

531
01:08:43,977 --> 01:08:46,980
there is, as yet, no trace.

532
01:08:47,063 --> 01:08:49,941
Would you come with me to
my study, please, Miss Lumley?

533
01:08:50,025 --> 01:08:52,444
You may carry on, Mademoiselle.

534
01:09:13,882 --> 01:09:16,384
Wonderful news,
Mrs. Appleyard.

535
01:09:17,719 --> 01:09:20,222
Don't be so foolish, woman!

536
01:09:20,305 --> 01:09:22,974
If all of them
had been found but only one?

537
01:09:23,058 --> 01:09:26,269
This makes it worse.
Far worse.

538
01:09:27,437 --> 01:09:29,898
This tragedy is little more
than a week old

539
01:09:29,981 --> 01:09:32,192
and already three--
three, mark you-- sets of parents

540
01:09:32,275 --> 01:09:37,239
have written advising me that their
daughters will not be here next term.

541
01:09:37,322 --> 01:09:41,076
Now the newspapers have something
further to sensationalize about.

542
01:09:41,117 --> 01:09:44,246
Newspapers all over the world
have headlined our morbid affair.

543
01:09:44,287 --> 01:09:46,748
I mean, you realize that,
I suppose.

544
01:09:47,666 --> 01:09:50,252
The three
who have been withdrawn,

545
01:09:50,335 --> 01:09:52,254
plus the three still missing
on the rock--

546
01:09:52,295 --> 01:09:55,549
Two, Mrs. Appleyard. Only two now.
I'm quite sure lrma will be coming back.

547
01:09:55,632 --> 01:09:59,261
That makes six, Miss Lumley,

548
01:09:59,344 --> 01:10:01,930
will not be with us next term.

549
01:10:03,807 --> 01:10:08,562
In addition, there are several sets
of tuition fees impossibly overdue.

550
01:10:08,645 --> 01:10:11,064
Sara Waybourne, for instance.

551
01:10:13,316 --> 01:10:16,611
Most inconsiderate,
if I may say so, Mrs. Appleyard.

552
01:10:17,904 --> 01:10:19,781
Yes.

553
01:10:21,158 --> 01:10:23,243
Well, l--

554
01:10:23,326 --> 01:10:27,622
I expect we shall
see our way through somehow.

555
01:10:27,664 --> 01:10:30,625
But don't let me detain you, You have
a class in a few minutes, I believe.

556
01:10:30,667 --> 01:10:32,752
Senior needlework.

557
01:10:32,836 --> 01:10:36,548
Just ask the Waybourne girl
to come in to see me, please.

558
01:10:36,631 --> 01:10:39,634
After luncheon
will be convenient.

559
01:10:39,676 --> 01:10:40,969
Yes, Mrs. Appleyard.

560
01:10:42,804 --> 01:10:45,599
Oh, and Miss Lumley.

561
01:10:45,682 --> 01:10:49,769
Do your best to forbid any idle gossip
about this whole wretched business.

562
01:10:49,853 --> 01:10:52,189
Yes, Mrs. Appleyard.
I will.

563
01:11:59,631 --> 01:12:04,344
Remarkable.

564
01:12:04,427 --> 01:12:08,598
A week out in the bush
and nothing more serious

565
01:12:08,682 --> 01:12:12,310
than shock and exposure.

566
01:12:12,394 --> 01:12:15,313
Extraordinary.

567
01:12:15,355 --> 01:12:18,108
No bones broken.

568
01:12:18,150 --> 01:12:22,863
Some cuts and bruises
to the face and hands.

569
01:12:24,531 --> 01:12:26,992
To the hands especially.

570
01:12:31,621 --> 01:12:33,540
Quite scratched.

571
01:12:35,292 --> 01:12:39,629
The fingernails
are all torn and broken.

572
01:12:39,671 --> 01:12:43,842
There are several other
unusual features.

573
01:12:43,925 --> 01:12:46,636
Her head
is quite badly bruised.

574
01:12:47,721 --> 01:12:51,475
Probable concussion.

575
01:12:51,516 --> 01:12:54,311
A blow, maybe?

576
01:12:54,352 --> 01:12:57,355
Or a fall?

577
01:12:57,439 --> 01:13:00,692
But then if she fell,

578
01:13:00,775 --> 01:13:04,237
why is the rest
of the body unmarked?

579
01:13:05,322 --> 01:13:07,240
It's quite unblemished.

580
01:13:08,867 --> 01:13:14,206
And the feet, too, are quite unmarked,
which is very strange

581
01:13:14,289 --> 01:13:18,502
as she was not wearing shoes
or stockings when she was found.

582
01:13:18,543 --> 01:13:20,837
We found no trace of 'em
up on the rocks.

583
01:13:24,883 --> 01:13:26,843
She's quite intact.

584
01:13:29,846 --> 01:13:34,100
I'd give my head to know
what really happened up there.

585
01:13:37,687 --> 01:13:39,606
She's quite intact.

586
01:13:44,444 --> 01:13:46,738
What is it, my girl?

587
01:13:46,822 --> 01:13:49,324
Well, ma'am,
it's Miss lrma.

588
01:13:49,407 --> 01:13:51,034
Yes?

589
01:13:51,117 --> 01:13:54,371
Well, it's
about her clothing.

590
01:13:54,454 --> 01:13:56,414
What is it, my dear?

591
01:13:56,456 --> 01:14:00,710
Well, I didn't know whether
the sergeant should be told.

592
01:14:00,752 --> 01:14:04,339
There's, there's no corset.

593
01:14:04,422 --> 01:14:08,135
Miss lrma's corset.
It's missing.

594
01:14:08,218 --> 01:14:10,262
You did right, my dear.

595
01:14:10,345 --> 01:14:13,223
It can't possibly be
of any interest.

596
01:14:15,267 --> 01:14:19,938
The north wind brings me no rest

597
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:24,067
Any number of unsolved
murders there are.

598
01:14:27,112 --> 01:14:29,739
Take, take Jack the Ripper,
for instance.

599
01:14:39,291 --> 01:14:41,835
The police are up there
again, naturally.

600
01:14:41,918 --> 01:14:43,837
Thick as flies.

601
01:14:46,173 --> 01:14:49,134
Someone reported seein' a light
flashing around a pigsty

602
01:14:49,217 --> 01:14:52,387
on a place about a mile
from the rock.

603
01:14:52,471 --> 01:14:56,349
There's some questions
got answers and some haven't.

604
01:15:00,937 --> 01:15:05,650
No. There'll be a solution
turn up directly, more'n likely.

605
01:15:09,321 --> 01:15:11,239
A kidnappin'.

606
01:15:12,616 --> 01:15:17,579
Or, you know,
something like that.

607
01:15:19,247 --> 01:15:21,666
They might have
fallen down a hole.

608
01:15:26,421 --> 01:15:30,717
No, no. There's a solution
somewhere, all right.

609
01:15:32,010 --> 01:15:34,179
There's gotta be.

610
01:15:34,262 --> 01:15:36,598
Come over here.
Come on.

611
01:15:36,681 --> 01:15:38,600
Over here.

612
01:15:42,771 --> 01:15:46,525
Did you know, lad, there are
some plants that can move?

613
01:15:48,652 --> 01:15:50,570
No.

614
01:16:15,011 --> 01:16:18,181
Miss Lumley said you wanted
to see me, Mrs. Appleyard.

615
01:16:18,223 --> 01:16:21,393
That is correct.
Come in.

616
01:16:22,894 --> 01:16:24,813
Close the door, please.

617
01:16:37,617 --> 01:16:42,205
I have written several letters
to your guardian, Mr. Cosgrove, Sara,

618
01:16:42,289 --> 01:16:45,542
but I have not been favored
with a reply thus far.

619
01:16:47,294 --> 01:16:52,382
In fact, it is all of six months
since I have received a letter

620
01:16:52,466 --> 01:16:55,552
or a check.

621
01:16:55,635 --> 01:17:00,557
I, therefore, have no alternative
but to cancel all your extras.

622
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:02,726
This means that,
as of today,

623
01:17:02,809 --> 01:17:07,481
you can no longer partake
in dancing or drawing lessons.

624
01:17:07,564 --> 01:17:11,776
And unless all your outstanding
fees are paid by Easter,

625
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:16,490
I'm afraid we shall have
to make other arrangements.

626
01:17:17,657 --> 01:17:20,869
You know what that means,
don't you, Sara?

627
01:17:23,621 --> 01:17:25,540
You will have to go away.

628
01:17:27,334 --> 01:17:32,255
There are places for girls
in your predicament. Institutions.

629
01:17:39,763 --> 01:17:41,681
Now off you go.

630
01:17:43,475 --> 01:17:45,393
Sara.

631
01:18:09,126 --> 01:18:12,254
Sara!
What's wrong with you?

632
01:18:14,422 --> 01:18:16,341
Are you feeling ill?

633
01:18:19,136 --> 01:18:22,806
People don't sit on cold steps in the
dark unless they're weak in the head.

634
01:18:27,060 --> 01:18:30,522
You heard the bell.
Go and wash for supper.

635
01:18:36,194 --> 01:18:38,113
Aren't you hungry?

636
01:18:41,408 --> 01:18:44,161
Well, you best
go straight to bed.

637
01:18:51,585 --> 01:18:53,044
Quickly.

638
01:19:00,218 --> 01:19:03,597
Tell Mademoiselle
I don't want it. Thank you.

639
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:08,310
But you must eat.
You'll get sick if you don't.

640
01:19:08,393 --> 01:19:12,939
I'm sick already.
If I eat that, I'll be even sicker.

641
01:19:13,023 --> 01:19:15,025
Nonsense.
Now come on, Miss Sara.

642
01:19:15,066 --> 01:19:17,694
Do you know what, Minnie?

643
01:19:17,736 --> 01:19:20,197
No. What?

644
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:23,241
I was in an orphanage once.

645
01:19:23,325 --> 01:19:25,243
Were you, Sara?

646
01:19:30,081 --> 01:19:34,878
I had a brother then...
called Bertie.

647
01:19:43,762 --> 01:19:48,433
I told the matron I wanted
to be a lady circus rider

648
01:19:48,517 --> 01:19:51,937
on a white horse
with a spangled dress.

649
01:19:54,940 --> 01:19:59,778
She was afraid I'd run away,
so she shaved my head.

650
01:20:01,363 --> 01:20:05,283
I bit her arm. It bled.

651
01:20:07,077 --> 01:20:10,664
So she painted my head
with gentian violet.

652
01:20:27,347 --> 01:20:32,602
The north wind brings me no rest

653
01:20:32,686 --> 01:20:37,607
And death is in the sky

654
01:20:39,985 --> 01:20:43,697
I love you, Minnie

655
01:20:46,241 --> 01:20:48,160
I love you, darlin'.

656
01:20:50,537 --> 01:20:53,707
I feel sorry
for them kids.

657
01:20:57,127 --> 01:21:00,130
The ones on the rock,
you mean?

658
01:21:00,172 --> 01:21:02,132
Yeah, them too.

659
01:21:04,050 --> 01:21:09,639
I was thinkin' of them other poor
little devils, here at the college.

660
01:21:11,933 --> 01:21:16,313
Them. They're all right.

661
01:21:16,354 --> 01:21:19,316
Rollin' in cash,
most of them.

662
01:21:19,399 --> 01:21:21,318
Or at least their mothers
and fathers are.

663
01:21:21,401 --> 01:21:24,529
Some of them are orphans

664
01:21:24,613 --> 01:21:26,740
or wards or--

665
01:21:28,408 --> 01:21:30,327
You know.

666
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:02,859
Now I know.

667
01:22:02,943 --> 01:22:07,030
What do you know ?
What do you know ?

668
01:22:09,115 --> 01:22:13,578
I know that Miranda
is a Botticelli angel.

669
01:22:45,277 --> 01:22:47,404
Hold it right there.
Thanks, gentlemen.

670
01:22:47,445 --> 01:22:49,406
That's it. Smile, please.

671
01:22:49,447 --> 01:22:52,242
Come on. Big smile.

672
01:22:52,325 --> 01:22:54,619
Thank you, thank you.

673
01:23:01,251 --> 01:23:03,170
Get those women
over here, please.

674
01:23:08,133 --> 01:23:11,595
The rope.
Not that stuff. The other.

675
01:23:11,636 --> 01:23:13,722
Give me that rope
over here.

676
01:23:13,805 --> 01:23:16,475
What about a cup of tea up here?

677
01:23:16,558 --> 01:23:18,727
Ah, tea. Ah.

678
01:23:21,396 --> 01:23:23,231
Hello!

679
01:23:32,949 --> 01:23:35,702
Good, good.

680
01:23:35,785 --> 01:23:37,704
As if looking up.
Right up.

681
01:23:37,787 --> 01:23:40,165
That's it. Looking for a cave
or something like that.

682
01:23:40,248 --> 01:23:42,667
Little more expression
in the face, sir.

683
01:23:51,468 --> 01:23:53,386
Hello, lrma.

684
01:23:57,015 --> 01:23:59,518
Madame Fitzhubert
showed me in.

685
01:24:04,147 --> 01:24:06,107
How do you feel?

686
01:24:11,112 --> 01:24:13,281
Oh, lrma!

687
01:24:13,365 --> 01:24:15,283
Oh, lrma.

688
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:19,079
We thought
you had gone forever.

689
01:24:25,752 --> 01:24:28,213
Let me
look at you, cherie.

690
01:24:30,590 --> 01:24:33,844
You are so pale

691
01:24:33,885 --> 01:24:36,346
but prettier than ever.

692
01:24:40,684 --> 01:24:43,812
Has the nephew
paid you a visit yet,

693
01:24:43,895 --> 01:24:46,523
the one who found you?

694
01:24:46,565 --> 01:24:48,525
Yes.

695
01:24:50,610 --> 01:24:52,529
And the policeman.

696
01:24:54,906 --> 01:24:56,783
And you couldn't--

697
01:24:59,703 --> 01:25:03,707
I, I remember...nothing.

698
01:25:03,790 --> 01:25:07,002
Nothing!
I remember nothing!

699
01:27:48,413 --> 01:27:50,332
Morning.

700
01:27:51,541 --> 01:27:53,460
Send that reporter packing!

701
01:27:53,543 --> 01:27:55,504
Girls. Girls,
get inside at once!

702
01:27:58,048 --> 01:28:00,884
There you are, Miranda, dear.

703
01:28:00,967 --> 01:28:03,970
You liked these best.

704
01:28:04,012 --> 01:28:07,766
Mr. Whitehead gave them
to me to give to you,

705
01:28:07,849 --> 01:28:11,895
my dear, my sweet Miranda.

706
01:28:22,197 --> 01:28:24,699
She likes daisies
best of all.

707
01:28:25,909 --> 01:28:29,162
Oh, Sara! Oh, Sara!

708
01:28:31,248 --> 01:28:34,793
You do know that Miranda
might not come back.

709
01:28:42,342 --> 01:28:45,846
Miranda knows lots of things
other people don't know.

710
01:28:49,015 --> 01:28:50,934
Secrets.

711
01:28:57,482 --> 01:28:59,901
She knew
she wouldn't come back.

712
01:29:09,786 --> 01:29:14,416
Fanny, you are ridiculously out of step.
Pay attention to the music, please!

713
01:29:37,022 --> 01:29:40,192
Excuse me, Miss Lumley.
Voila, mes enfants!

714
01:29:40,275 --> 01:29:42,861
See who we have with us today?

715
01:29:42,944 --> 01:29:47,532
Our dear lrma
is with us but for a few hours.

716
01:29:47,616 --> 01:29:51,495
She is leaving soon
to join her parents in Europe.

717
01:29:53,788 --> 01:29:56,166
Alors, mes enfants.

718
01:29:56,249 --> 01:29:59,044
For ten minutes,
you may talk as you choose.

719
01:29:59,127 --> 01:30:01,797
If you approve,
Miss Lumley.

720
01:30:29,074 --> 01:30:31,034
Tell us, lrma! Tell us!

721
01:30:31,117 --> 01:30:33,036
Tell us, lrma! Tell us!

722
01:30:33,119 --> 01:30:35,038
What happened to Miranda, lrma?

723
01:30:35,121 --> 01:30:37,040
You know what happened.
Tell us!

724
01:30:40,502 --> 01:30:42,462
Tell us, Irma!

725
01:30:42,504 --> 01:30:45,549
Why don't you tell us, lrma?
You know where they are!

726
01:30:45,590 --> 01:30:49,427
Just tell us, lrma!
Tell us!

727
01:30:49,511 --> 01:30:52,055
They're dead!
All dead and gone, Irma!

728
01:30:55,058 --> 01:30:58,353
She's going to you know where!

729
01:30:58,395 --> 01:31:00,397
You are a liar and a fool!

730
01:31:27,757 --> 01:31:29,759
Mademoiselle?

731
01:31:29,801 --> 01:31:31,761
Mademoiselle?

732
01:31:31,803 --> 01:31:35,849
It's for her own good!
To cure her terrible stooping!

733
01:31:54,951 --> 01:31:56,870
Come in.

734
01:32:04,753 --> 01:32:07,839
Well? Come in.

735
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:22,771
My notice, ma'am.

736
01:33:11,153 --> 01:33:13,947
Have we an invalid
in the house?

737
01:33:14,030 --> 01:33:16,283
Miss Sara's supper, ma'am.

738
01:33:16,366 --> 01:33:19,703
Mademoiselle asked me, seeing
as the child's feeling poorly.

739
01:33:19,786 --> 01:33:21,997
Oh. Minnie!

740
01:33:24,166 --> 01:33:28,712
Tell Miss Sara not to put her light out
until I've had a word with her.

741
01:33:28,795 --> 01:33:30,755
Yes, ma'am.

742
01:33:40,265 --> 01:33:43,185
this is not a charitable institution.

743
01:33:57,782 --> 01:34:00,952
You recall our recent
discussion, Sara.

744
01:34:03,955 --> 01:34:07,167
Answer me when
I address you, child.

745
01:34:07,250 --> 01:34:09,377
Yes.

746
01:34:09,419 --> 01:34:12,923
I have considered
your situation most carefully,

747
01:34:14,424 --> 01:34:18,720
and I have searched my mind
and my conscience for a solution.

748
01:34:18,804 --> 01:34:23,391
But this is not
a charitable institution.

749
01:34:23,475 --> 01:34:26,102
And as your fees
have not been forthcoming,

750
01:34:26,144 --> 01:34:30,732
I have been forced to make
certain arrangements on your behalf.

751
01:34:34,027 --> 01:34:36,112
You will be returned
to the orphanage.

752
01:36:13,335 --> 01:36:15,253
You still thinking
about that bloody rock ?

753
01:36:15,337 --> 01:36:17,839
I can't help it.

754
01:36:17,923 --> 01:36:20,842
It comes back
at night in dreams.

755
01:36:21,802 --> 01:36:24,763
I had a funny dream
last night.

756
01:36:24,846 --> 01:36:28,016
There was this smell.
Real strong.

757
01:36:29,476 --> 01:36:33,396
It was like, like I was wide awake.
Dead quiet.

758
01:36:34,981 --> 01:36:37,234
Pansies.
That's what it smelt like.

759
01:36:37,317 --> 01:36:40,403
And the whole place
was all lit up, bright as day.

760
01:36:43,365 --> 01:36:45,283
Pitch black outside.

761
01:36:46,868 --> 01:36:48,787
And there she is.

762
01:36:50,247 --> 01:36:52,207
Who was it?

763
01:36:52,249 --> 01:36:54,209
It was only a bloody dream!

764
01:36:57,295 --> 01:37:01,424
My kid sister. Haven't seen her
since the orphanage.

765
01:37:01,466 --> 01:37:03,927
She always liked pansies.

766
01:37:06,054 --> 01:37:10,934
And she went
all sort of...misty-like.

767
01:37:13,436 --> 01:37:18,275
I calls out,
"Sara, don't go yet."

768
01:37:20,610 --> 01:37:23,280
"Good-bye, Bertie," she says.

769
01:37:23,363 --> 01:37:27,367
"l've come a long way to see ya,
and now I must go."

770
01:37:28,368 --> 01:37:30,287
And she went.

771
01:37:31,454 --> 01:37:33,415
Clear through that wall
over there.

772
01:37:43,300 --> 01:37:45,051
Sit down, please, Mademoiselle.

773
01:37:45,135 --> 01:37:47,053
Merci.

774
01:37:47,137 --> 01:37:51,016
We were speaking last night
about the Waybourne girl.

775
01:37:51,099 --> 01:37:54,853
You expressed concern
over the state of her health.

776
01:37:54,936 --> 01:37:56,313
Yes, madame.

777
01:37:56,354 --> 01:37:59,858
We have been relieved
of any further responsibility.

778
01:37:59,941 --> 01:38:05,280
Her guardian, Mr. Cosgrove, arrived
this morning and took her away with him.

779
01:38:09,618 --> 01:38:13,330
That's-- But was she
fit enough to travel?

780
01:38:14,372 --> 01:38:16,708
Apparently.

781
01:38:16,792 --> 01:38:19,795
I should have been here
to supervise her packing.

782
01:38:19,836 --> 01:38:22,672
I, myself, helped Sara
put a few things she especially wanted

783
01:38:22,756 --> 01:38:24,674
into her little covered basket.

784
01:38:24,758 --> 01:38:27,093
Mr. Cosgrove
was in a hurry to get away.

785
01:38:27,177 --> 01:38:29,805
I shall not be coming
into luncheon, Mademoiselle.

786
01:38:29,846 --> 01:38:32,015
Kindly tell them
not to lay a place for me.

787
01:38:32,057 --> 01:38:34,017
Nor for Sara?

788
01:38:34,059 --> 01:38:35,685
Nor for Sara.

789
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:44,361
Is that rouge I see
on your cheek, Mademoiselle?

790
01:38:45,570 --> 01:38:49,825
Powder, madame.
I find it becoming.

791
01:38:54,538 --> 01:38:56,456
Oh, God.

792
01:39:13,181 --> 01:39:15,684
Thank you very much
for the lovely breakfast!

793
01:39:19,688 --> 01:39:21,565
Hope you have
a nice holiday!

794
01:39:25,902 --> 01:39:27,737
Au revoir!

795
01:39:27,821 --> 01:39:30,073
Frere Jacques
Frere Jacques

796
01:39:30,157 --> 01:39:32,075
Au revoir, mes enfants.

797
01:39:32,159 --> 01:39:35,996
Dormez vous
Dormez vous

798
01:39:36,079 --> 01:39:38,081
Au revoir!

799
01:40:16,119 --> 01:40:19,915
Arthur,
my late husband, and I

800
01:40:19,956 --> 01:40:24,461
always took our annual
holidays in Bournemouth.

801
01:40:24,544 --> 01:40:27,714
It's a delightful place.

802
01:40:27,798 --> 01:40:31,635
Absolutely delightful.
Nothing changed.

803
01:40:31,718 --> 01:40:35,555
Ever.
For 40 years.

804
01:40:35,639 --> 01:40:40,018
The pier, the sands
and the people.

805
01:40:40,101 --> 01:40:42,979
And that guest house.

806
01:40:43,021 --> 01:40:45,607
So dependable.

807
01:40:45,690 --> 01:40:49,694
Completely
and utterly dependable.

808
01:40:54,157 --> 01:40:56,034
A little more,
Mademoiselle?

809
01:40:56,117 --> 01:40:58,036
No, madame.

810
01:40:59,037 --> 01:41:00,997
As you wish.

811
01:41:10,590 --> 01:41:15,262
I came to depend so much
on Greta McCraw.

812
01:41:15,345 --> 01:41:18,598
So much masculine intellect.

813
01:41:18,682 --> 01:41:21,518
I came to rely
on that woman.

814
01:41:21,601 --> 01:41:23,645
Trust her.

815
01:41:23,728 --> 01:41:27,566
How could she allow herself
to be spirited away?

816
01:41:27,607 --> 01:41:30,110
Lost.

817
01:41:30,193 --> 01:41:32,529
Raped.

818
01:41:32,571 --> 01:41:35,657
Murdered in cold blood
like a silly schoolgirl

819
01:41:35,699 --> 01:41:39,202
on that wretched
Hanging Rock.

820
01:41:47,544 --> 01:41:51,089
Will Sara Waybourne be coming
back this term, madame?

821
01:41:51,173 --> 01:41:53,049
Oh!

822
01:41:54,259 --> 01:41:57,012
Now where was l?

823
01:41:57,095 --> 01:42:01,516
Oh, yes!
Bournemouth.

824
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:05,061
What a delightful place!

825
01:42:05,103 --> 01:42:09,149
Nothing changed. Ever.

826
01:42:11,943 --> 01:42:13,862
Dirty kids.

827
01:42:49,689 --> 01:42:51,608
Oh!

828
01:42:51,691 --> 01:42:55,320
Oh! Oh!

829
01:43:08,583 --> 01:43:12,504
Sara! Sara!

830
01:43:28,562 --> 01:43:30,897
The body of Mrs. Arthur Appleyard,

831
01:43:30,981 --> 01:43:33,108
principal of Appleyard College,

832
01:43:33,150 --> 01:43:38,321
was found at the base of Hanging Rock
on Friday the 27th of March, 1900.

833
01:43:38,363 --> 01:43:42,159
Although the exact circumstances
of her death are not known,

834
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:46,496
it is believed she fell while
attempting to climb the rock.

835
01:43:46,580 --> 01:43:49,416
A search for the missing schoolgirls
and their governess

836
01:43:49,499 --> 01:43:54,838
continued spasmodically
for the next few years without success.

837
01:43:54,921 --> 01:43:59,384
To this day, their disappearance
remains a mystery.
