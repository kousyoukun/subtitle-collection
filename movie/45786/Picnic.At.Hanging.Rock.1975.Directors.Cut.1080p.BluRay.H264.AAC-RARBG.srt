10
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,119
都是一个梦

我爱你 名门的优雅

00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,139
还有你深邃的眼神

19
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,139

十一

27
00:03:34,975 --> 00:03:38,141
我爱你 并非你美丽的头发

28
00:03:38,888 --> 00:03:42,130
如绒毛般柔软 如天空般光滑

29
00:03:43,142 --> 00:03:46,142
也不是因为你深深眼窝中

30
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:49,142
丘比特的神箭

31
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:52,142
你知道到底是什么原因吗 

32
00:03:52,882 --> 00:03:56,132
因为我爱你 一如你爱我一般

阿普莉亚德学院 1900年情人节

35
00:05:23,844 --> 00:05:27,150
萨拉 总有一天你一定会和我一起回家 

36
00:05:27,856 --> 00:05:29,151
去昆士兰

37
00:05:29,928 --> 00:05:33,140
亲自见见我可爱有趣的家人

38
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:35,740
你愿意吗 

39
00:05:43,152 --> 00:05:47,152
萨拉 除此之外

40
00:05:48,004 --> 00:05:51,142
你还必须学会热爱其他人

41
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,542
我不会在这里呆很久

42
00:06:03,309 --> 00:06:04,548
你认为怎样 米兰达 

43
00:06:04,548 --> 00:06:07,154
有人鼓起勇气送给迈克劳小姐一张卡片

44
00:06:07,154 --> 00:06:10,744
写在满是小数点的座标纸上

45
00:06:15,154 --> 00:06:17,154
姑娘们 姑娘们 

46
00:06:17,593 --> 00:06:19,154
除非你们用更加优雅的

47
00:06:19,154 --> 00:06:22,155
能发出更小声音的方式下课

48
00:06:22,155 --> 00:06:23,655
否则阿普莉亚德太太

49
00:06:23,656 --> 00:06:26,155
今天就不会让你们去海茵悬崖郊游

50
00:06:26,155 --> 00:06:27,155
早上好 鲁姆莉小姐

51
00:06:27,155 --> 00:06:30,135
早上好 波蒂尔斯小姐

52
00:06:34,007 --> 00:06:35,731
我相信阿普莉亚德太太

53
00:06:35,732 --> 00:06:38,146
已经决定不让你去郊游 萨拉

54
00:06:39,703 --> 00:06:41,816
那意味着我们俩都不能去

55
00:06:43,493 --> 00:06:45,043
你可以走了 

56
00:06:46,719 --> 00:06:49,558
为圣瓦伦丁干杯 

57
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,150
法语 
Tais-toi, Irma. Miss McCraw vient d'arriver.

58
00:07:27,161 --> 00:07:29,161
她今天想学代数

59
00:07:29,161 --> 00:07:31,150
今天 

60
00:08:02,141 --> 00:08:03,164
早上好 姑娘们

61
00:08:03,164 --> 00:08:05,408
早上好 阿普莉亚德太太
[Together] Good morning, Mrs. Appleyard.

62
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:07,130
年轻的女士们 天气对我们非常的照顾
Well, young ladies, we are indeed fortunate in the weather

63
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,808
很适合我们 今天去海茵悬崖郊游
for our picnic to Hanging Rock.

64
00:08:10,008 --> 00:08:11,650
我已经通知老师了
I have instructed Mademoiselle

65
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:12,950
如果今天暖和的话
that as the day is likely to be warm,

66
00:08:13,257 --> 00:08:17,705
穿过伍邓德的时候 你们可以脱掉手套
you may remove your gloves once the drag has passed through Woodend.

67
00:08:18,026 --> 00:08:22,065
你们要在岩石上 吃光带去郊游的食物
You will partake of luncheon at the picnic grounds near the rock.

68
00:08:22,065 --> 00:08:26,451
我再次提醒你们 那块岩石非常的危险
Once again let me remind you that the rock is extremely dangerous,

69
00:08:26,451 --> 00:08:30,866
因此 切不可顽皮地探险
and you are therefore forbidden any tomboy foolishness

70
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:33,166
哪怕是在非常低的斜坡上
in the matter of exploration, even on the lower slopes.

71
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:37,080
我还要提醒你们 附近的居民说那里有毒蛇
I also wish to remind you, the vicinity is renowned for its venomous snakes

72
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,168
以及不同种类的毒蚁
and poisonous ants of various species.

73
00:08:40,635 --> 00:08:43,168
总之 你们要在星期一写一篇
It is, however, a geological marvel

74
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:47,080
有关地质方面的随笔
on which you will be required to write a brief essay on Monday morning.

75
00:08:48,035 --> 00:08:50,981
就说到这了祝你们玩的开心
That is all. Have a pleasant day,

76
00:08:50,981 --> 00:08:54,169
一定要留心自己的礼仪 要给学院树立风范
and try to behave yourselves in a manner to bring credit to the college.

77
00:08:54,819 --> 00:08:58,157
哈西先生 哈西先生 
Mr. Hussey! Mr. Hussey!

78
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,169
我希望你 迈克劳小姐和老师
I shall expect you back, Miss McCraw and Mademoiselle,

79
00:09:02,169 --> 00:09:04,080
晚上8前回来参加烛光晚宴
at about 8:00 for a light supper.

80
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,832
来吧 姑娘们
Come, girls.

81
00:09:08,169 --> 00:09:10,159
哇噢 
Whoa!

82
00:09:25,171 --> 00:09:28,860
阿普莉亚德女子教育学院

83
00:09:38,023 --> 00:09:40,441
这样对我们实在太好了
This we do for pleasure

84
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:43,173
我们可以短暂地
so that we may shortly be at the mercy

85
00:09:43,173 --> 00:09:46,525
任由毒蛇和毒蚁处置
of venomous snakes and poisonous ants.

86
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:50,062
人类到底有多笨 
How foolish can human creatures be?

87
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:49,168
就在那 女士们海茵悬崖 
There she is, ladies. Hangin' Rock.

88
00:10:51,781 --> 00:10:54,179
穆罕默德来到了此山中
The mountain comes to Mohammed.

89
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:57,252
哈西来到了悬崖上
A hanging rock comes to Mr. Hussey.

90
00:10:58,396 --> 00:11:00,780
她有500英尺高
More than 500 feet high she is.

91
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:04,179
是火山岩 有数千年的历史
Volcanic, of course. Thousands of years old.

92
00:11:04,816 --> 00:11:08,119
哈西先生 她差不多有一百万年的历史
A million years old, Mr. Hussey, or thereabouts.

93
00:11:08,646 --> 00:11:11,694
是的 没错
Yes, well, that'd be right.

94
00:11:12,222 --> 00:11:14,180
数千年 数百万年
Thousands, millions.

95
00:11:15,153 --> 00:11:19,207
从某种意义上说 有种非常悠久的历史
Devil of a long time, anyway, in a manner of speakin'.

96
00:11:19,247 --> 00:11:21,745
才一百万年前
Only a million years ago. 

97
00:11:22,007 --> 00:11:24,404
实际上是最近一次火山爆发造成的
Quite a recent eruption, really.

98
00:11:25,181 --> 00:11:28,182
马其顿山周围的岩石
The rocks all around Mount Macedon itself

99
00:11:28,599 --> 00:11:32,171
一定有350万年的历史
must be all of 350 million years old.

100
00:11:34,672 --> 00:11:40,903
从上升处都是硅酸火山岩
Siliceous lava forced up from deep down below.

101
00:11:41,956 --> 00:11:44,128
那粗糙面的岩石
Soda trachytes

102
00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:48,409
在非常胶粘的状态下挤压
extruded in a highly viscous state,

103
00:11:48,409 --> 00:11:52,995
形成了我们现在所看到的 陡峭多棱的山脉
building the steep-sided mountains we see in Hanging Rock.

104
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,709
坦白讲 她的历史非常年轻 
And quite young, geologically speaking. 

105
00:11:58,047 --> 00:11:59,856
才一百万年
Barely a million years.

106
00:12:00,935 --> 00:12:05,431
一百万年来就是为了等我们
Waiting a million years just for us.

107
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:36,382
还要蛋糕吗 迈克尔 
More cake, Michael?

108
00:12:38,013 --> 00:12:39,921
不用了 谢谢 阿姨我
No, thank you, Aunt. I'm...

109
00:12:40,862 --> 00:12:43,257
我想四处走走
I think I'll just, um, stretch my legs a bit.

110
00:12:43,257 --> 00:12:47,004
哦 别走太远 小心点
Oh, don't go too far and be careful.

111
00:12:47,185 --> 00:12:49,221
可能有蛇
There could be snakes.

112
00:13:26,191 --> 00:13:27,395
你还好吗 
How's it goin'?

113
00:13:27,784 --> 00:13:28,908
还好
All right.

114
00:13:30,587 --> 00:13:32,277
他们吃完东西了吗 
They finished eating, have they?

115
00:13:34,196 --> 00:13:34,953
嗯 
Eh?

116
00:13:36,342 --> 00:13:38,603
上校和他太太 他们吃完东西了吗 
The colonel and the missus... they finished eating, have they?

117
00:13:38,662 --> 00:13:41,453
哦 是的 吃完了
Oh, yes, they have.

118
00:13:42,967 --> 00:13:44,765
我想马上就上去
Expect me up there in a minute, I suppose.

119
00:13:44,765 --> 00:13:46,183
收拾干净
Clear away.

120
00:13:52,595 --> 00:13:54,194
中午不可能
Can't be more'n midday.

121
00:13:54,194 --> 00:13:55,271
是的
No.

122
00:13:59,446 --> 00:14:01,790
我想我吃中饭早了点
I thought it was a little early for lunch myself.

123
00:14:02,774 --> 00:14:03,374
是的
Yes.

124
00:14:06,572 --> 00:14:07,875
要喝吗 
Drink?

125
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,497
谢谢
Thank you.

126
00:14:15,196 --> 00:14:19,197
你知道 他们一直都 允许我推迟一个小时过去
You know, they always allow an hour longer than it takes to get 'ere,

127
00:14:19,197 --> 00:14:22,196
然后他们就直接离去
and then they got 'ere straight away.

128
00:14:23,661 --> 00:14:24,629
谢谢
Thanks.

129
00:14:32,051 --> 00:14:33,186
啊
Ah.

130
00:14:34,793 --> 00:14:37,197
倒不是他们没事可做
Not that they got anything else to do.

131
00:14:37,633 --> 00:14:40,534
我是说 他们从不毫无理由地出来散步
I mean, they never go for a walk or nothin'.

132
00:14:55,104 --> 00:14:56,189
快点 
(Mr. Hussey) Get on!

133
00:14:57,719 --> 00:14:59,190
快 
Come on!

134
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:17,428
摘下帽子 我们现在就出发
Take your hats. Let's go walk about now.

135
00:15:40,431 --> 00:15:44,852
-为圣瓦伦丁干杯 
-为圣瓦伦丁干杯 

136
00:16:04,867 --> 00:16:07,444
我希望你已经学会了你的诗 萨拉
I hope you have learned your poetry, Sara.

137
00:16:08,528 --> 00:16:11,206
坐直了孩子 肩膀挺直
Sit up straight, child. Hold your shoulders back.

138
00:16:11,206 --> 00:16:12,718
你会驼背的
You're getting a dreadful stoop.

139
00:16:13,831 --> 00:16:16,207
那么 你诗歌背熟了吗 
Well, have you got your lines by heart?

140
00:16:17,634 --> 00:16:18,839
有吗 
Well, have you?

141
00:16:19,704 --> 00:16:22,207
我背不了 一点意义也没有
I can't. It doesn't make sense.

142
00:16:22,845 --> 00:16:25,560
意义 你这小傻瓜 
Sense! You little ignoramus!

143
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:28,402
很显然你不了解 菲利西娅 ・ 海曼斯夫人
Evidently you don't know that Mrs. Felicia Heymans

144
00:16:28,402 --> 00:16:31,343
她是英国诗人中最为有名的一个
is considered one of the finest of our English poets.

145
00:16:33,207 --> 00:16:35,701
我背熟了诗歌的另外一部分
I know another piece of poetry by heart.

146
00:16:35,905 --> 00:16:39,713
它有很多诗节 比“金星号的毁灭”还多
It has ever so many verses, much more than "The Wreck of the Hesperus."

147
00:16:39,808 --> 00:16:40,587
不是吗 
Would that do?

148
00:16:40,814 --> 00:16:42,775
这首诗叫什么 
What is the name of this poem?

149
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,010
圣瓦伦丁颂歌 
"An Ode to St. Valentine."

150
00:16:45,249 --> 00:16:47,810
我没听说过 你是在哪找到的 
I'm not acquainted with it. Where did you find it?

151
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:50,210
不是找到的 是我写的
I didn't find it. I wrote it.

152
00:16:50,571 --> 00:16:52,199
你写的 
You wrote it?

153
00:16:54,564 --> 00:16:56,923
爱的存在 爱的包围 
"Love abounds, love surrounds..."

154
00:16:56,923 --> 00:16:58,211
哦不 萨拉 谢谢
Oh, no thank you, Sara.

155
00:16:58,211 --> 00:17:02,192
似乎有点奇怪 我还是更喜欢海曼斯夫人的诗
Strange as it may seem, I still prefer Mrs. Heymans.

156
00:17:02,714 --> 00:17:05,732
把你的书给我 能背多少就给我背多少
Give me your book and proceed to recite to me as far as you have gone.

157
00:17:06,966 --> 00:17:08,741
请把你的书给我 萨拉 
Your book, please, Sara.

158
00:17:10,953 --> 00:17:11,913
谢谢
Thank you.

159
00:17:13,211 --> 00:17:14,438
继续
Go on.

160
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,201
我背不出来
I can't.

161
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,083
一句也背不出来 
Not one line?

162
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:24,794
我现在要离开你了 萨拉
I shall leave you now, Sara.

163
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:27,471
我希望一小时内 我叫鲁姆莉小姐过来时
I expect you to be word perfect when I send Miss Lumley in

164
00:17:27,471 --> 00:17:29,563
你能背得滚瓜烂熟
in half an hour.

165
00:17:30,104 --> 00:17:32,043
否则 我会叫你上床睡觉
Otherwise, I'm afraid I shall have to send you to bed

166
00:17:32,589 --> 00:17:35,578
而不是让你站着 直到其他人郊游回来
instead of letting you stay up until the others return from the picnic.

167
00:17:49,215 --> 00:17:53,204
波蒂 波蒂 
[Whispering] Bertie! Bertie!

168
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,957
天哪 你在哪 
Jesus, where are you?

169
00:17:59,216 --> 00:18:00,821
哦 米兰达 
Oh, Miranda!

170
00:18:09,216 --> 00:18:11,206
我喜欢这个
(girl) I like this one.

171
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:16,080
我可以把你 比喻成夏季的节日 
"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?

172
00:18:17,414 --> 00:18:21,535
你会更加的可爱更加的温和
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.

173
00:18:21,846 --> 00:18:25,006
大风摇动着五月的蓓蕾
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,

174
00:18:26,124 --> 00:18:29,206
夏季为所有人 出租了短暂的约会 …
And summer's lease hath all too short a date."

175
00:18:35,218 --> 00:18:36,278
真奇怪
(Mr. Hussey) That's funny!

176
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:40,711
如果我的表没停止的话 我就砸掉它
Blowed if me watch hasn't stopped.

177
00:18:44,005 --> 00:18:46,036
12点正
Dead on 12:00.

178
00:18:50,197 --> 00:18:51,415
真奇怪
Real funny.

179
00:18:51,616 --> 00:18:53,221
法语 
[Speaking French]

180
00:18:53,221 --> 00:18:55,210
法语 
C'est tres jolie, n'est-ce pas?

181
00:18:58,221 --> 00:19:00,925
我想 小姐 你没有时间吧 
Uh, you wouldn't have the time, I suppose, miss?

182
00:19:04,222 --> 00:19:07,921
米兰达 你可爱的钻石表
Ah, Miranda, your pretty little diamond watch.

183
00:19:08,221 --> 00:19:10,221
不再戴它了
Don't wear it anymore.

184
00:19:10,894 --> 00:19:12,674
我的心脏受不了嘀哒声
Can't stand the ticking above my heart.

185
00:19:13,114 --> 00:19:14,211
啊
Ah.

186
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:16,805
如果是我的话我 
If it were mine, I'd wear it always.

187
00:19:17,705 --> 00:19:21,544
我会永远戴着它 哪怕是洗澡的时候
Even in the bath.

188
00:19:22,443 --> 00:19:24,166
你会吗 哈西先生 
Would you, Mr. Hussey?

189
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:31,223
12点就停了
Stopped at 12:00.

190
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:37,055
以前从没停过 一定是有磁性东西存在
Never stopped before. Must be something magnetic.

191
00:19:37,255 --> 00:19:39,386
我想2点后就会正常的
Well after 2:00, I'd say.

192
00:19:40,372 --> 00:19:42,139
我们最好是小心点
We'd better be careful.

193
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,725
我向亚普莉亚德太太保证过了
I promised Mrs. Appleyard

194
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,761
8点前我必须把你们带回学院
I'd have you lot back at the college by 8:00.

195
00:19:50,932 --> 00:19:53,225
除下面的那些人之外
Except for those people down there,

196
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:57,572
我们可能是整个世界唯一活着的生灵
we might be the only living creatures in the whole world.

197
00:20:13,969 --> 00:20:15,327
打扰一下 老师
(girl) Excuse me, Mademoiselle.

198
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,279
什么事 马里恩 
Yes, Marion?

199
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:19,228
如果有时间的话 我想和米兰达 厄玛
I should like to make a few measurements of the rock if we have time.

200
00:20:19,228 --> 00:20:21,860
一起去测量几块岩石
With Miranda and Irma.

201
00:20:24,562 --> 00:20:26,285
求你了 老师
Please, Mademoiselle.

202
00:20:27,356 --> 00:20:30,000
喝茶的时间以前我们会赶回来的
 We'll be back long before tea.

203
00:20:31,914 --> 00:20:33,217
法语 
Et bien. Allez!

204
00:20:36,025 --> 00:20:38,048
我也可以去吗 
May I come too, please?

205
00:20:38,229 --> 00:20:39,986
只要你不抱怨就行
So long as you don't complain.

206
00:20:40,229 --> 00:20:42,229
我不会的我保证
I won't. I promise.

207
00:20:42,229 --> 00:20:44,229
别担心我们 老师
And don't worry about us, Mademoiselle.

208
00:20:44,229 --> 00:20:47,083
我们只去一会儿
We shall only be gone a little while.

209
00:21:04,611 --> 00:21:05,502
啊
Ah.

210
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:10,378
现在我知道了
Now I know.

211
00:21:11,602 --> 00:21:13,137
你知道什么 
What do you know?

212
00:21:15,785 --> 00:21:20,462
我知道米兰达是一个波提切利天使
I know that Miranda is a Botticelli angel.

213
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:45,770
等等 
(Edith) Wait!

214
00:21:54,574 --> 00:21:58,761
你可以想象一下它吗 伊迪丝 
(Miranda) Can you manage it, Edith?

215
00:21:58,761 --> 00:22:00,581
我不知道
I don't know.

216
00:22:03,237 --> 00:22:06,178
我不想把脚弄湿
I don't want to get my feet wet.

217
00:22:11,459 --> 00:22:13,486
噢 
Oh!

218
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:23,067
我还以为那个小胖子要洗澡
Thought the little fat one was gonna take a bath.

219
00:22:27,239 --> 00:22:29,738
她们中一些人真的是非常漂亮
Some of them are real lookers.

220
00:22:30,221 --> 00:22:33,333
看看那个黑色卷发的那个
Have a look at the shape of the dark one with the curls.

221
00:22:34,037 --> 00:22:35,886
体形像是一个沙漏
Built like an hourglass.

222
00:22:39,089 --> 00:22:42,205
快看最后一个 那个金发碧眼女孩 
And 'ave a go at the last one! The blonde!

223
00:22:42,892 --> 00:22:46,133
噢 她有一双多么漂亮的腿
Oh, she'd have a decent pair of legs.

224
00:22:46,603 --> 00:22:48,580
一直延伸至她的臀部
All the way up to her bum.

225
00:22:49,007 --> 00:22:51,157
我希望你不要说这么粗鲁的话
I'd rather you didn't say crude things like that.

226
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:57,649
噢 我只是说说 而你却在心里想
Oh, I say the crude things. You just think 'em.

227
00:22:57,829 --> 00:22:59,457
米兰达 
(Edith) Miranda!

228
00:23:00,316 --> 00:23:01,190
记住我的话
Take my word for it.

229
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:04,411
少女们长大后都是一样的
The sheilas are all alike when it comes to fellas.

230
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:08,529
无论你是来自该死的学院
Doesn't matter if it's a bloody college you come from

231
00:23:08,743 --> 00:23:12,146
还是来自扶养我和 姐姐长大的巴拉拉特孤儿院
or the Ballarat Orphanage where me and me kid sister was dragged up.

232
00:23:12,246 --> 00:23:13,924
我不知道你是孤儿
I didn't know you were an orphan.

233
00:23:15,242 --> 00:23:19,232
天哪我已经好多年没有想过这事了
Geez. I haven't thought of that bloody dump in donkeys' years.

234
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:38,119
米兰达 
(Edith) Miranda!

235
00:23:46,245 --> 00:23:50,885
离开前 我想四处逛逛
I think I'll just, uh, stretch my legs a bit before we go.

236
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:04,642
看 
Look!

237
00:25:06,253 --> 00:25:08,617
不要向下看 伊迪丝 
Not down at the ground, 

238
00:25:08,617 --> 00:25:10,797
看看上面的天空
Edith. Way up there in the sky.

239
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:44,260
我们不能只是坐在这原木上
Why can't we just sit on this log

240
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:47,774
看着这里古老丑陋的岩石吧 
and look at the ugly old rock from here?

241
00:26:50,278 --> 00:26:51,261
这里好脏 
[Whining] It's nasty here!

242
00:26:51,261 --> 00:26:54,261
我从未想过它会这么脏
I never thought it would be so nasty,

243
00:26:54,261 --> 00:26:55,549
否则我不会来 
or I wouldn't have come!

244
00:27:55,267 --> 00:27:57,529
我们不能走太远
We can't go much further.

245
00:27:59,064 --> 00:28:00,783
我们向老师保证过的
We promised Mademoiselle

246
00:28:02,521 --> 00:28:04,528
我们不会走太远
we wouldn't be long away.

247
00:28:22,876 --> 00:28:25,270
如果我们能整晚呆在户外
If only we could stay out all night

248
00:28:26,493 --> 00:28:28,698
看着月亮升起来多好啊
and watch the moon rise.

249
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:32,079
布兰奇说萨拉在厕所里写诗歌 
(Edith) Blanche said Sara writes poetry in the dunny!

250
00:28:32,129 --> 00:28:38,208
她在地板上发现一本 全是写米兰达的诗
She found one there on the floor all about Miranda.

251
00:28:38,897 --> 00:28:40,538
她是个孤儿
She's an orphan.

252
00:28:46,531 --> 00:28:51,216
萨拉让我想起爸爸 曾经给我买的一头小鹿
Sara reminds me of a little deer Papa brought home once.

253
00:28:52,555 --> 00:28:57,093
我照顾它 但它还是死了
I looked after it, but it died.

254
00:28:59,545 --> 00:29:02,655
妈妈一直说那是命中注定的
Mama always said it was doomed.

255
00:29:04,102 --> 00:29:07,119
命中注定 什么意思 厄玛 
Doomed? What's that mean, Irma?

256
00:29:07,137 --> 00:29:09,274
当然是命中注定会死
Doomed to die, of course.

257
00:29:09,725 --> 00:29:12,048
那个男孩站在燃烧的甲板上
"The boy stood on the burning deck,

258
00:29:12,148 --> 00:29:14,274
他无处可逃 …
whence all but he had fled, tra la..."

259
00:29:15,351 --> 00:29:16,523
后面的我忘了
I forget the rest.

260
00:29:16,523 --> 00:29:22,908
我想我也是命中注定了 我感觉不舒服
I think I must be doomed. I don't feel at all well.

261
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:26,591
我希望你们别说了
I do wish you'd stop talking for once.

262
00:29:27,886 --> 00:29:31,599
可怜的伊迪丝 我们马上就回去
Poor Edith. We'll go back soon.

263
00:30:50,211 --> 00:30:53,035
厄玛 快看她们 
Irma! Look at them!

264
00:30:56,223 --> 00:30:58,743
她们究竟是要去哪 
Where in the world are they going?

265
00:30:59,282 --> 00:31:01,272
没穿鞋 
Without their shoes!

266
00:31:03,891 --> 00:31:06,284
厄玛 等等 等等我 
Irma, wait! Wait for me!

267
00:31:06,284 --> 00:31:10,273
请等等 等等 厄玛 
Please wait! Wait, Irma, wait!

268
00:31:18,164 --> 00:31:21,028
那些人在下面 到底在干什么啊 
Whatever can those people be doing down there?

269
00:31:21,943 --> 00:31:24,285
和许多蚂蚁一样
Like a lot of ants.

270
00:31:24,285 --> 00:31:28,474
让人奇怪的人 很多人都没有目的
Surprising the number of human beings are without purpose.

271
00:31:29,922 --> 00:31:31,285
尽管很可能 
Although it is probable

272
00:31:31,285 --> 00:31:37,373
他们是在履行某种 他们自己也不清楚的仪式
they're performing some function unknown to themselves.

273
00:31:48,287 --> 00:31:52,276
万事万物的兴起和灭亡
Everything begins and ends

274
00:31:53,487 --> 00:31:58,451
都有其确定的时代 和地方
at exactly the right time and place.

275
00:32:00,061 --> 00:32:01,277
看 
Look!

276
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,186
米兰达 我很难受
(Edith) Miranda, I feel awful,

277
00:34:02,438 --> 00:34:03,935
真的很难受
really awful.

278
00:34:04,129 --> 00:34:06,079
噢
Oh.

279
00:34:07,739 --> 00:34:10,848
米兰达 我真的非常难受
Miranda, I feel perfectly awful.

280
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:12,901
我们什么时候回家 
When are we going home?

281
00:34:15,938 --> 00:34:18,339
我们什么时候回家 
When are we going home?

282
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,083
米兰达 
Miranda?

283
00:34:30,052 --> 00:34:31,297
米兰达 
Miranda!

284
00:34:34,178 --> 00:34:35,985
米兰达 
Miranda!

285
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:39,767
米兰达 别上去 回来 
Miranda, don't go up there! Come back!

286
00:35:15,056 --> 00:35:17,638
我必须走了那是亚普莉亚德太太
I've gotta go. That's Mrs. Appleyard.

287
00:35:17,753 --> 00:35:19,005
让别人去吧
Let someone else go.

288
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,690
他们不会去的 不 是我值日
They won't. No. I'm on.

289
00:35:22,081 --> 00:35:24,132
现在几点了 
[Mutters] What time is it?

290
00:35:31,105 --> 00:35:33,075
我们要做什么 
What've you got to do?

291
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:38,919
亚普莉亚德太太会剥我的皮
Mrs. Appleyard'll skin me.

292
00:35:38,919 --> 00:35:40,538
我们有充足的时间
We got plenty of time.

293
00:35:51,508 --> 00:35:53,206
你还是走吧
You'd better go.

294
00:36:22,311 --> 00:36:25,094
他们怎么这么晚还没来 
[Whispering] Why are they so late?

295
00:36:55,197 --> 00:36:56,274
上帝保佑 
God be praised!

296
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,314
老师 你们怎么这么晚 
Mademoiselle, why are you so late?

297
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:15,752
太太 发生了非常可怕的事情
Madame, something terrible has happened.

298
00:37:16,066 --> 00:37:19,130
什么 什么意思 
What? What do you mean?

299
00:37:19,546 --> 00:37:20,316
我无法 
I can't...

300
00:37:20,316 --> 00:37:23,349
迈克劳小姐呢 
And where in heaven's name is Miss McCraw?

301
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:27,163
我们把她抛在岩石上了
We left her behind at the rock.

302
00:37:27,163 --> 00:37:29,079
你们把她抛在后面 
You left her behind?

303
00:37:30,951 --> 00:37:33,466
所有人都失去理智了吗 
Has everyone taken leave of their senses?

304
00:37:34,464 --> 00:37:36,633
鲁姆莉小姐 马上带姑娘们去睡觉
Miss Lumley, get these girls to bed immediately.

305
00:37:36,633 --> 00:37:40,094
库克 库克 给她们所有人准备好热汤
And Cook, Cook! Hot soup, please, for all of them.

306
00:37:42,614 --> 00:37:45,618
亚普莉亚德夫人 我 必须单独和您谈谈
Mrs. Appleyard, I-I must speak to you alone.

307
00:37:45,799 --> 00:37:47,017
好吧
Very well.

308
00:37:54,959 --> 00:37:58,319
直接上楼 姑娘们快 尽快
Straight up the stairs, girls. Come along, quickly as you can.

309
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:00,781
库克 我叫你去弄热汤 
Cook, I asked you for hot soup!

310
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:19,315
夫人 夫人 情况是这样的
(Mr. Hussey) Well, ma'am, ma'am, the strength of it is this.

311
00:38:21,487 --> 00:38:23,868
3个年轻的小姐
Three of your young ladies

312
00:38:24,321 --> 00:38:28,079
还有迈克劳小姐
and Miss McCraw

313
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:33,311
在那个岩石上消失了
are m-missing on the rock.

314
00:38:36,326 --> 00:38:37,661
发生什么事了 
What happened?

315
00:38:39,323 --> 00:38:42,323
这个 亚普莉亚德夫人
Well, now, Mrs. Appleyard,

316
00:38:42,323 --> 00:38:44,312
这有点困难
that's just the trouble.

317
00:38:45,883 --> 00:38:48,523
没人知道当时发生了什么事
Nobody knows what happened.

318
00:38:51,094 --> 00:38:54,323
那3个女孩离开后多久 迈克劳小姐才不见的 
How soon after the girls did Miss McCraw leave?

319
00:38:54,974 --> 00:38:58,168
不知道 也没人知道
Don't know. No one knows.

320
00:38:59,572 --> 00:39:03,013
没人看见她离开 我们都睡着了
No one saw her leave. We were asleep.

321
00:39:05,512 --> 00:39:07,140
那个小女孩呢 
And the little one?

322
00:39:07,905 --> 00:39:09,092
伊迪丝 ・ 霍顿 
Edith Horton.

323
00:39:11,806 --> 00:39:14,026
就像我跟你说的
Like I told you,

324
00:39:14,925 --> 00:39:17,258
她哭着从灌木中跑出来 
she come tearin' out of the bushes,

325
00:39:17,258 --> 00:39:19,079
衣衫褴褛
dress all torn,

326
00:39:20,006 --> 00:39:22,627
并尖叫不已 
screamin' fit to...

327
00:39:25,206 --> 00:39:28,864
等我们安抚她平静下来后 才从她口中得知 
Well, after we'd shooshed her screamin', all we could get out of her

328
00:39:28,964 --> 00:39:32,317
她把另外3个女孩抛在岩石上了
was that she'd left the other three somewhere up on the rock.

329
00:39:36,892 --> 00:39:38,756
我只能告诉你这些
That's about all I can tell ya.

330
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:48,425
米兰达 米兰达 
Miranda! Miranda!

331
00:39:52,329 --> 00:39:53,648
马里恩 
Marion!

332
00:39:57,365 --> 00:39:58,318
马里恩 
Marion!

333
00:40:08,757 --> 00:40:09,934
马里恩

334
00:40:28,823 --> 00:40:31,541
继续走 我们离开这
Go on,

335
00:40:33,276 --> 00:40:34,664
噢 别乱动 
Ah, stop it!

336
00:40:38,044 --> 00:40:38,923
走吧
Come on.

337
00:40:42,334 --> 00:40:44,323
米兰达 
(man) Miranda!

338
00:41:01,176 --> 00:41:03,357
仔细想想 伊迪丝
(Mademoiselle) Try to remember, Edith,

339
00:41:08,128 --> 00:41:11,324
你是在岩石上受到惊吓的
what it was that frightened you on the rock.

340
00:41:15,536 --> 00:41:18,908
好好想想 亲爱的好好想想
Think carefully, darling. Carefully!

341
00:41:20,171 --> 00:41:22,129
你和别人说过话吗 
Did you speak to anyone?

342
00:41:23,337 --> 00:41:25,970
其中一定有蹊跷
There must have been something.

343
00:41:28,274 --> 00:41:29,527
有男人吗 
Was there a man?

344
00:41:36,507 --> 00:41:39,622
她的腿严重刮伤
Her legs were quite severely scratched.

345
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,327
我想应该是穿过有刺灌木时造成的
From running through the brambles, I should imagine.

346
00:41:47,051 --> 00:41:48,534
没其他的了 
Nothing else?

347
00:41:53,327 --> 00:41:56,395
其他的暂时还没发现什么
Nothing I could detect.

348
00:42:02,677 --> 00:42:06,668
她有没有受到…调戏 
She hadn't been... molested?

349
00:42:07,382 --> 00:42:09,964
没有 没有这样的事
No, no, nothing like that.

350
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:15,199
我检查过她 她还是处女
I have examined her. She is quite intact.

351
00:42:27,998 --> 00:42:30,343
既然你不愿意告诉我具体情况
Since you won't tell me all the details,

352
00:42:30,343 --> 00:42:32,741
我又怎能给你建议 莱昂内尔 
how can I give you an opinion, Lionel?

353
00:42:33,934 --> 00:42:35,716
没有具体情况
There are no details.

354
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:38,555
人不会无缘无故消失 亲爱的
People just don't disappear, my dear.

355
00:42:39,001 --> 00:42:40,816
一定有理由的
Not without good reason.

356
00:42:42,789 --> 00:42:44,144
这算是谈话吗 
There's talk, is there?

357
00:42:44,344 --> 00:42:48,344
不仅仅是谈话我们可以…推测
Not just gossip. People have... theories.

358
00:42:48,444 --> 00:42:50,045
说下去
Go on.

359
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:53,009
不可能是当地人干的
Well, it couldn't be local.

360
00:42:54,021 --> 00:42:55,078
为什么不是 
Why couldn't it?

361
00:42:55,834 --> 00:42:58,749
附近没人会做这样的事
No one around here would do a thing like that.

362
00:43:00,287 --> 00:43:01,567
我刚刚告诉过你 
I've just told you, I simply noticed three young ladies crossing the creek.

363
00:43:01,567 --> 00:43:04,296
我只看见3个年轻的小姐穿过小溪

364
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,049
都长什么样 
What did they look like?

365
00:43:07,727 --> 00:43:08,345
嗯 
Hmm?

366
00:43:08,345 --> 00:43:11,533
那些女孩 长什么样
The girls. Describe them to me.

367
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:16,772
哦 第一个黑黑瘦瘦的
Hmm, um, the first one was tall and dark.

368
00:43:20,524 --> 00:43:22,052
第二个矮矮胖胖的
Um, then there was the little dumpy one,

369
00:43:22,348 --> 00:43:24,809
第三个戴着眼镜
then the girl with the glasses,

370
00:43:27,088 --> 00:43:29,791
最后一个身材苗条 金发
and the last one was slim and fair.

371
00:43:31,637 --> 00:43:33,225
四个了
That's four.

372
00:43:35,528 --> 00:43:36,267
什么 
Pardon?

373
00:43:37,339 --> 00:43:39,559
刚才你不是说只有3个人吗 
A few minutes ago you said there was only three of them.

374
00:43:40,348 --> 00:43:41,757
哦 是的 
Oh-Oh, ye...

375
00:43:43,218 --> 00:43:45,882
那是因为那个 小胖子在后面一点
That's because the dumpy one was back a little.

376
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:50,441
然后她们进入了树丛中
And then they moved off into the trees

377
00:43:51,222 --> 00:43:53,740
这是我们最后一次看见的情况
and that's the last we saw of them.

378
00:43:57,353 --> 00:43:59,810
或许我们还可以再走上面一点
Perhaps we could go a little higher.

379
00:44:01,715 --> 00:44:03,340
我当时很累
I was tired.

380
00:44:05,299 --> 00:44:07,118
我坐在一根原木上
I sat down on a log.

381
00:44:07,318 --> 00:44:09,680
哪根原木 伊迪丝 这根吗 
Which log, Edith? This one?

382
00:44:09,994 --> 00:44:13,617
四处看看 亲爱的或许你现在可以找到
Look around you, darling. Maybe you can see it now.

383
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:16,312
是这个吗 你们是往那边走的吗 
Is that the one? You went that way?

384
00:44:16,412 --> 00:44:17,543
我不知道
I don't know.

385
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:22,341
我当时很累 现在也很累
I was tired. I'm tired now.

386
00:44:28,237 --> 00:44:30,353
我还记得一件事
There is one thing I remember.

387
00:44:30,353 --> 00:44:32,653
你还记得什么伊迪丝 快告诉我们
What do you remember, Edith? Tell us.

388
00:44:33,075 --> 00:44:35,102
那是我下来时的事了
It was when I was coming down,

389
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:37,027
当时我正在跑
when I was running.

390
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:39,334
我看到一片云
It was a cloud.

391
00:44:39,634 --> 00:44:41,194
什么云 
What sort of a cloud?

392
00:44:42,175 --> 00:44:43,687
红色的云
It was red.

393
00:44:44,958 --> 00:44:49,344
我记得非常清楚 当时恰好遇到迈克劳小姐
I remember it clearly. It was just after I passed Miss McCraw.

394
00:44:52,128 --> 00:44:54,078
你说你看到谁 
Who did you say you saw?

395
00:44:54,129 --> 00:44:55,582
迈克劳小姐
Miss McCraw.

396
00:44:55,597 --> 00:44:58,927
我往下跑时 她往山上走
She was going up the hill as I was going down.

397
00:44:58,927 --> 00:45:02,055
她停下过吗 你和她说过话吗 
Did she stop? Did you speak?

398
00:45:02,174 --> 00:45:04,355
没有她离我很远
No. She was too far away.

399
00:45:04,355 --> 00:45:08,345
当时离我的距离 有到那些枯树那么远
She was about as far away as those dead trees are over there.

400
00:45:13,771 --> 00:45:15,456
她当时很好笑 
[Edith giggling]
She was funny.

401
00:45:15,856 --> 00:45:16,892
好笑 
Funny?

402
00:45:19,797 --> 00:45:20,697
怎么好笑
How?

403
00:45:21,188 --> 00:45:22,858
我不能说
I'd rather not say.

404
00:45:23,296 --> 00:45:26,835
你必须说出来 伊迪丝这事可能非常重要
You must, Edith. It could be very important.

405
00:45:27,205 --> 00:45:28,936
说出来不文雅
It's rude.

406
00:45:40,865 --> 00:45:42,119
内裤
Les pantalons.

407
00:45:43,047 --> 00:45:47,573
她没穿裙子 只穿着内裤
She had no skirt. Just les pantalons.

408
00:45:47,733 --> 00:45:51,849
内裤 你说她只穿着内裤 
Drawers? You mean she was just wearing drawers?

409
00:46:32,597 --> 00:46:34,354
能去的都去了
One last go

410
00:46:36,121 --> 00:46:38,112
包括警犬在内
for the bloodhound.

411
00:46:44,365 --> 00:46:46,354
米兰达
Miranda.

412
00:47:49,821 --> 00:47:52,414
为什么不告诉我们 你跟着那四个女孩 
Why didn't you tell us you followed the four girls?

413
00:47:54,459 --> 00:47:55,734
因为… 
Because...

414
00:47:58,841 --> 00:48:00,483
我并没有跟着她们
I didn't exactly follow them.

415
00:48:00,692 --> 00:48:03,697
我只是跳过那个小溪
I just jumped across the creek

416
00:48:03,697 --> 00:48:05,964
然后朝岩石方向走了一段路
and walked towards the rock for a little way.

417
00:48:08,546 --> 00:48:10,295
我当时很好奇
I was curious.

418
00:48:14,318 --> 00:48:18,958
在英国 那样的年轻女性是不允许走路的
In England, young ladies like that wouldn't be allowed to go walking.

419
00:48:19,367 --> 00:48:20,716
总之不能单独出门
Not alone, anyway.

420
00:48:22,404 --> 00:48:24,623
但是我从树林出来时 她们就不见了
But they'd gone by the time I came out of the trees,

421
00:48:25,264 --> 00:48:27,100
所以我就回去了
so I turned back.

422
00:48:32,539 --> 00:48:36,363
那些女孩跳过小溪的时候
As the girls were jumping the creek,

423
00:48:39,033 --> 00:48:40,637
你在想什么 
what were you thinking of?

424
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:49,960
嗯 
Hmm?

425
00:49:12,377 --> 00:49:14,366
啊 迈克尔
Ah, Michael.

426
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:57,374
哦 迈克尔 
Oh, Michael!

427
00:50:20,846 --> 00:50:23,094
那个老头雇我照看马匹
The old man hired me to look after the horses.

428
00:50:24,036 --> 00:50:27,806
如果成为该死的花园派对的男仆 我会累死
I'm buggered if I'm gonna be a lackey at a bloody garden party.

429
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:31,140
这就是我告诉他们的
That's what I bloody well told 'im.

430
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:34,070
算是吧
More or less.

431
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:49,846
前几天那只大警犬出去了
Had the bloodhound out the other day.

432
00:50:57,415 --> 00:50:59,697
我每天都会提心吊胆地醒来
I wake up every night in a cold sweat.

433
00:51:02,458 --> 00:51:04,299
一直担心她们是否还活着
Just wondering if they're still alive.

434
00:51:05,379 --> 00:51:07,072
是的 我是这样看待这事的 
Yeah, well, the way I look at it is this:

435
00:51:07,072 --> 00:51:10,038
如果那该死的警察和澳洲追捕者
If the bloody cop and the bloody abo tracker

436
00:51:10,038 --> 00:51:11,757
还有那该死的狗没有找到的话
and the bloody dog can't find 'em, well, no one bloody can.

437
00:51:11,757 --> 00:51:13,950
那就没人找得到了
People have been bushed before today,

438
00:51:15,805 --> 00:51:17,717
今天之前 人们都累死了

439
00:51:17,717 --> 00:51:20,143
只要和我有关 就一定会有始有终
and as far as I'm concerned, that's the stone end of it.

440
00:51:20,143 --> 00:51:22,594
和我有关的事还没结束呢
Well, it's not the end of it as far as I'm concerned.

441
00:51:25,327 --> 00:51:28,892
她们可能会…渴死在… 
They may be out there dying of thirst on...

442
00:51:30,204 --> 00:51:32,330
那可恶的悬崖上 
on that infernal rock and...

443
00:51:33,704 --> 00:51:37,073
而我们俩却坐在这里 喝着凉凉的啤酒
you and I are sitting here drinking cold bloody beer.

444
00:51:41,243 --> 00:51:43,302
这就是我们俩的不同之处
That's where you and me's different.

445
00:51:49,516 --> 00:51:50,391
如果你接受我的建议
If you want my advice, the sooner you forget the whole thing, the better.

446
00:51:50,391 --> 00:51:52,341
你还是尽快忘记整个事的好
Well, I can't forget it,

447
00:51:52,391 --> 00:51:55,092
我无法忘掉 也永远忘不掉
and I never will.

448
00:52:04,907 --> 00:52:06,733
我对音乐不感兴趣
I'm not great shakes on music,

449
00:52:06,933 --> 00:52:09,251
不过我相信总督一定会离开 对吧 
but I reckon the governor must be leavin', eh?

450
00:52:12,479 --> 00:52:14,393
如果你没露面的话 你姑妈会训斥你
Your aunt'll give you hell if you're not on show.

451
00:52:14,393 --> 00:52:15,739
艾尔伯特
Albert.

452
00:52:18,638 --> 00:52:21,383
我想回岩石那里去
I want to go back to the rock.

453
00:52:24,087 --> 00:52:25,583
去找找她们
To look for them.

454
00:52:27,818 --> 00:52:29,411
你愿意和我一起去吗 
Will you come with me?

455
00:52:43,776 --> 00:52:45,859
漂亮的女人游逛
Beautiful birds, them swans.

456
00:52:50,293 --> 00:52:52,084
在灌木丛中一周了
A week in the bush,

457
00:52:54,356 --> 00:52:56,967
到现在 她们一定死了
they'd be dead by now.

458
00:52:58,873 --> 00:53:00,970
那我一个人去
Then I'll go alone.

459
00:55:11,128 --> 00:55:14,078
艾尔伯特 
Albert!

460
00:55:15,297 --> 00:55:16,755
喂 
Hello?

461
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:35,400
迈克 
(Albert) Mike!

462
00:55:37,411 --> 00:55:40,595
迈克尔 
Michael!

463
00:55:53,413 --> 00:55:56,598
迈克尔 
Michael!

464
00:56:09,849 --> 00:56:11,630
我们必须快点
We'll have to be goin' soon.

465
00:56:12,475 --> 00:56:14,408
天黑前我们必须回去
Dark before we get back.

466
00:56:15,486 --> 00:56:17,046
我要留在这
I'm staying here.

467
00:56:19,014 --> 00:56:20,384
你要什么 
You're what?

468
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:22,617
我要留在这
I'm staying here.

469
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:24,715
这里 在岩石上 
Here? On the rock?

470
00:56:24,727 --> 00:56:25,932
是的
Yes.

471
00:56:26,803 --> 00:56:31,247
为什么 你疯了吗 
What the hell for? You're mad.

472
00:56:31,247 --> 00:56:34,739
也许吧 但我还是要留下来 也必须有人留下来
Yes, perhaps I am. But I'm still staying, because somebody has to.

473
00:56:35,067 --> 00:56:38,244
-只因为你的命运是澳大利亚人
-你真是即有趣又讨厌 

474
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:43,758
那我回去怎么和他们说 

475
00:56:43,958 --> 00:56:46,270
你随便怎么告诉他们都可以

476
00:56:48,816 --> 00:56:51,681
嗯 什么 伍邓德 
Hmm? What? Woodend?

477
00:56:51,681 --> 00:56:53,698
是维多利亚 长官
The Victoria, sir.

478
00:56:54,199 --> 00:56:56,650
是那个区附近的小客栈
The little pub near the corner.

479
00:56:57,618 --> 00:57:03,057
迈克尔先生非常累 长官 他在那里睡觉
Mr. Michael's pretty knocked up, sir. He's sleepin' there.

480
00:57:04,214 --> 00:57:05,078
那个客栈
The pub.

481
00:57:06,086 --> 00:57:09,024
是的是的
Yeah. Yeah.

482
00:57:10,073 --> 00:57:14,234
如果我知道他姑妈的想法 我就狼狈了
I'm dashed if I know how his aunt will take it.

483
00:57:14,719 --> 00:57:16,409
是的
Yeah.

484
00:57:25,573 --> 00:57:27,819
好吧你去吧 库仑多
All right. Carry on, Crundall.

485
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:29,780
谢谢您 长官
Thank you, sir.

486
00:59:49,722 --> 00:59:51,769
十二点整停下来了
(Miss McCraw's Voice) Stopped at twelve.

487
00:59:51,769 --> 00:59:54,315
以前从未停过
Never stopped before.

488
00:59:55,242 --> 00:59:59,961
任何事物的兴衰 
(Miranda's Voice) Everything begins and ends

489
01:00:01,045 --> 01:00:02,733
都有其的特定的阶段
at exactly the right time.

490
01:00:02,894 --> 01:00:06,434
等了一百万年就是为了等我们
(lrma's Voice) Waiting a million years just for us.

491
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:10,039
看 上面的天空 
(Miranda's Voice) Look! Way up there in the sky!

492
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:11,434
现在我知道了 
(Mademoiselle) Now I know!

493
01:00:11,534 --> 01:00:13,884
你知道什么 
(Miss McCraw's Voice) What do you know?

494
01:00:14,442 --> 01:00:16,835
让人吃惊的是很多人 
(Marion's Voice) Surprising the number of human beings

495
01:00:16,921 --> 01:00:19,035
都是毫无目的
are without purpose.

496
01:00:19,435 --> 01:00:21,135
虽然很可能是 
Although it is probable

497
01:00:21,335 --> 01:00:24,435
他们是在履行某种 他们自己也不清楚的仪式
they are performing some function unknown to themselves.

498
01:00:24,435 --> 01:00:30,030
任何事物的兴衰 
(Miranda's Voice) Everything begins and ends

499
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:34,387
都有其特定的阶段和地方
at exactly the right time and place.

500
01:00:44,517 --> 01:00:46,271
米兰达
Miranda.

501
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:57,733
米兰达 
Miranda!

502
01:01:02,141 --> 01:01:03,428
米兰达 
Miranda!

503
01:01:08,926 --> 01:01:11,510
米兰达 
Miranda!

504
01:03:24,076 --> 01:03:26,140
把他交给我吧 孩子
Let me have him now, son.

505
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:29,451
我有30年照顾他的经验
I've had 30 years experience puttin' them in

506
01:03:29,751 --> 01:03:33,440
这样他就不会摔到路上了
so they don't fall out back on the road.

507
01:03:39,752 --> 01:03:43,441
慢点驾车 军士
Eh, take her quietly, Sergeant.

508
01:05:26,462 --> 01:05:28,450
噢 天哪
Oh, Jesus. Jesus.

509
01:05:43,463 --> 01:05:45,452
帮帮我 
Help me!

510
01:05:57,465 --> 01:05:59,454
帮帮我 
Help me!

511
01:06:03,465 --> 01:06:05,488
老师 他们找到厄玛了
[Whispering] Mademoiselle, they found Irma.

512
01:06:06,174 --> 01:06:07,373
他们怎么说 
What did you say?

513
01:06:07,373 --> 01:06:10,163
他们找到厄玛了 她还活着
They found Irma, and she's still alive.

514
01:06:10,973 --> 01:06:12,239
噢… 
Oh...

515
01:06:16,507 --> 01:06:18,233
没其他人了 
No one else?

516
01:06:18,466 --> 01:06:20,455
是的
No.

517
01:06:36,896 --> 01:06:40,757
快回家去你们帮不上什么忙
Now go home. There's nothing you can do.

518
01:06:43,468 --> 01:06:47,458
走吧 快点回家去吧 这是警方的事
Go on, now. Go home! This is a police matter.

519
01:06:52,469 --> 01:06:54,458
快走吧
Well, go on.

520
01:07:10,770 --> 01:07:12,749
我们现在就想知道
(man #1) We've got a bloody right to know.

521
01:07:12,749 --> 01:07:14,920
我们想知道事情的经过
We'd like to know what's going on.

522
01:07:15,067 --> 01:07:16,460
他说的没错
(man #2) He's right.

523
01:07:18,379 --> 01:07:21,433
我们只想知道到底是怎么回事
We simply want something done about it.

524
01:07:22,228 --> 01:07:24,516
布菲尔在哪 
Where's Bumpher?

525
01:07:26,907 --> 01:07:30,231
我们应该亲自去那该死的悬崖那里
What we should do is go to the bloody rock ourselves.

526
01:07:31,942 --> 01:07:34,358
我们有权知道真相
We've got our own self-respect to think about.

527
01:07:34,358 --> 01:07:37,926
没错 叫布菲尔出来快点
He's right, there. Get Bumpher out here. Come on.

528
01:07:37,926 --> 01:07:41,462
出来 布菲尔 
Come out, Bumpher!

529
01:07:43,872 --> 01:07:44,473
回去吧
Go back.

530
01:07:44,738 --> 01:07:48,473
走吧 回家吧 大家都回去
(Bumpher) Go on. Go home. The bloody lot of you.

531
01:07:48,973 --> 01:07:51,348
你们帮不上忙的
Nothing you can do.

532
01:08:01,476 --> 01:08:03,276
我们可以感谢上帝
We can thank the Lord

533
01:08:03,276 --> 01:08:07,020
将我们的同学厄玛仁慈地 从死神那里释放出来
for this merciful deliverance of our dear classmate Irma

534
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:09,476
我们祈祷马里恩和米兰达
and pray that Marion and Miranda

535
01:08:09,476 --> 01:08:12,476
以及我们心爱的迈克劳小姐 也会幸免于难
and our beloved Miss McCraw will be likewise spared.

536
01:08:13,271 --> 01:08:17,555
厄玛在马其顿峰的 菲兹伯格上校家中一定会康复
It has been seen fit that Irma should convalesce

537
01:08:17,555 --> 01:08:19,861
这点是毫无疑问的
at the home of Colonel Fitzhubert in Mount Macedon.

538
01:08:20,230 --> 01:08:22,477
尽管你们听到 这个消息会很高兴
Although you'll be delighted at these good tidings,

539
01:08:22,477 --> 01:08:24,477
我还是请你们记住
I would ask you to remember, please,

540
01:08:24,477 --> 01:08:26,477
去郊游的剩下3名成员 
that of the three remaining lost members of the party,

541
01:08:26,477 --> 01:08:29,077
还没有任何消息
there is, as yet, no trace.

542
01:08:30,332 --> 01:08:32,397
-愿意和我一起研究吗 鲁姆莉小姐
-是的夫人 
Would you come with me to my study, please, Miss Lumley?

543
01:08:32,397 --> 01:08:34,344
你可以继续了 老师
(Miss Lumley) You may carry on, Mademoiselle.

544
01:08:57,611 --> 01:09:00,141
好消息 亚普莉亚德夫人
Wonderful news, Mrs. Appleyard.

545
01:09:00,871 --> 01:09:02,922
别傻了 女士 
Don't be so foolish, woman!

546
01:09:03,285 --> 01:09:05,981
如果他们有一个没找到呢 
If all of them had been found but only one?

547
01:09:06,421 --> 01:09:09,833
这会更加的糟糕 非常的糟糕
This makes it worse. Far worse.

548
01:09:10,481 --> 01:09:12,481
这个悲剧已经过去一周了
This tragedy is little more than a week old

549
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:15,482
已经有3对父母
and already three... three, mark you... sets of parents

550
01:09:15,482 --> 01:09:19,077
写信告诉我说 他们的女儿下学期不会来了
have written advising me that their daughters will not be here next term.

551
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:24,097
现在 报社更是对此添油加醋
Now the newspapers have something further to sensationalize about.

552
01:09:24,097 --> 01:09:27,308
全世界的报纸都在头条 刊登了这条不幸的消息
Newspapers all over the world have headlined our morbid affair.

553
01:09:27,308 --> 01:09:29,825
我想 你已经意识到了
I mean, you realize that, I suppose.

554
01:09:30,883 --> 01:09:33,411
那3个性格内向的学生
The three who have been withdrawn,

555
01:09:33,411 --> 01:09:35,375
加上3个在悬崖上失踪的 
plus the three still missing on the rock...

556
01:09:35,475 --> 01:09:37,433
是2个 亚普莉亚德夫人现在只有2个
Two, Mrs. Appleyard. Only two now. I'm quite sure Irma will be coming back.

557
01:09:37,483 --> 01:09:38,972
我相信厄玛一定会康复的
That makes six, Miss Lumley,

558
01:09:38,972 --> 01:09:41,682
总共是6个 鲁姆莉小姐

559
01:09:42,653 --> 01:09:45,393
下学期不会来了
will not be with us next term.

560
01:09:46,484 --> 01:09:50,473
另外 有几个的学费 可能会过期延付
In addition, there are several sets of tuition fees impossibly overdue.

561
01:09:51,974 --> 01:09:54,701
比如萨拉 ・ 维伯尼
Sara Waybourne, for instance.

562
01:09:56,626 --> 01:09:57,736
大多数非常轻率
Most inconsiderate,

563
01:09:57,786 --> 01:10:00,521
如果我可以这样说的话 亚普莉亚德夫人
if I may say so, Mrs. Appleyard. Yes.

564
01:10:00,821 --> 01:10:01,821
是的

565
01:10:04,332 --> 01:10:05,577
我… 
Well, l...

566
01:10:06,874 --> 01:10:10,224
我希望 我们会挺过这个困难局面
I expect we shall see our way through somehow.

567
01:10:10,787 --> 01:10:13,486
不过我不想挽留你 我想你马上要上课了
But don't let me detain you, You have a class in a few minutes, I believe.

568
01:10:13,486 --> 01:10:15,486
毕业班的刺绣课
Senior needlework.

569
01:10:16,121 --> 01:10:19,903
叫那个维伯尼女孩进来见我
Just ask the Waybourne girl to come in to see me, please.

570
01:10:20,727 --> 01:10:22,387
中饭后可能更方便点
After luncheon will be convenient.

571
01:10:22,487 --> 01:10:24,220
好的 亚普莉亚德夫人
Yes, Mrs. Appleyard.

572
01:10:26,121 --> 01:10:27,663
噢 还有 鲁姆莉小姐
Oh, and Miss Lumley.

573
01:10:28,334 --> 01:10:32,488
你最好禁止学生谈 这次灾难性的悲剧
Do your best to forbid any idle gossip about this whole wretched business.

574
01:10:32,488 --> 01:10:35,469
好的 亚普莉亚德夫人 我会的
Yes, Mrs. Appleyard. I will.

575
01:11:26,793 --> 01:11:29,296
嘘… 
Shh!

576
01:11:33,407 --> 01:11:34,797
啊 
Ah!

577
01:11:42,493 --> 01:11:44,483
真少见
(Doctor) Remarkable. Hmm.

578
01:11:47,621 --> 01:11:51,494
在灌木丛中呆了一周 没有比受惊 暴晒 
A week out in the bush and nothing more serious

579
01:11:51,494 --> 01:11:54,077
更为糟糕的了
than shock and exposure.

580
01:11:55,706 --> 01:11:57,741
真是少见
Extraordinary.

581
01:11:58,471 --> 01:12:00,827
没有骨骼损伤
No bones broken.

582
01:12:01,343 --> 01:12:06,024
脸部和手部有一些伤口和瘀伤
Some cuts and bruises to the face and hands.

583
01:12:07,632 --> 01:12:10,116
尤其是手部
To the hands especially.

584
01:12:14,638 --> 01:12:16,486
刮伤得严重
Quite scratched.

585
01:12:18,184 --> 01:12:22,497
手指甲全都破了
The fingernails are all torn and broken.

586
01:12:22,497 --> 01:12:26,498
还有其他几处非常寻常的特征
There are several other unusual features.

587
01:12:26,986 --> 01:12:30,374
她的头刮伤非常严重
Her head is quite badly bruised.

588
01:12:30,830 --> 01:12:33,405
可能产生脑震荡
Probable concussion.

589
01:12:34,541 --> 01:12:36,381
可能被殴打过 
A blow, maybe?

590
01:12:37,111 --> 01:12:38,776
或者摔倒过 
Or a fall?

591
01:12:40,562 --> 01:12:42,891
不过若是摔倒的话
But then if she fell,

592
01:12:43,617 --> 01:12:47,077
为什么身体其他部位没有痕迹 
why is the rest of the body unmarked?

593
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:50,945
毫无污点
It's quite unblemished.

594
01:12:51,879 --> 01:12:55,489
还有脚部也没有污点 真是奇怪
And the feet, too, are quite unmarked, which is very strange

595
01:12:56,200 --> 01:13:01,578
她被人发现时 甚至没有穿鞋和袜子
as she was not wearing shoes or stockings when she was found.

596
01:13:01,578 --> 01:13:03,967
我们在岩石上 没有发现它们的痕迹
We found no trace of 'em up on the rocks.

597
01:13:03,967 --> 01:13:05,090
嗯
Mmm.

598
01:13:07,943 --> 01:13:11,091
她还是处子之身
She's quite intact.

599
01:13:12,864 --> 01:13:17,068
我真的无法知道上面到底发生什么事
(Doctor) I'd give my head to know what really happened up there.

600
01:13:20,503 --> 01:13:23,236
她还是完璧之身
She's quite intact.

601
01:13:27,599 --> 01:13:29,029
什么事情 我的女孩 
What is it, my girl?

602
01:13:29,504 --> 01:13:32,226
夫人 是厄玛小姐的东西
Well, ma'am, it's Miss Irma.

603
01:13:32,317 --> 01:13:33,243
是吗 
Yes?

604
01:13:34,248 --> 01:13:37,362
这是她的衣服
Well, it's about her clothing.

605
01:13:37,612 --> 01:13:39,378
到底什么事 亲爱的 
What is it, my dear?

606
01:13:39,621 --> 01:13:43,522
我不知道是否有人告诉过那个军士
Well, I didn't know whether the sergeant should be told.

607
01:13:43,822 --> 01:13:47,128
没有 没有胸衣
There's, there's no corset.

608
01:13:47,737 --> 01:13:51,124
厄玛的胸衣不见了
Miss Irma's corset. It's missing.

609
01:13:51,124 --> 01:13:52,505
你做的对 亲爱的
You did right, my dear.

610
01:13:53,165 --> 01:13:56,494
可能没人会对那个感兴趣
It can't possibly be of any interest.

611
01:14:04,722 --> 01:14:07,715
还有很多疑案没解决
Any number of unsolved murders there are.

612
01:14:10,190 --> 01:14:14,227
比如 那个杀人碎尸的杰克
Take, take Jack the Ripper, for instance.

613
01:14:22,383 --> 01:14:24,527
自然 警方还会上去调查的
The police are up there again, naturally.

614
01:14:24,627 --> 01:14:26,497
多得像苍蝇
Thick as flies.

615
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:33,047
据说有人看见离那岩石 一英里远的猪舍中 
Someone reported seein' a light flashing around a pigsty

616
01:14:33,047 --> 01:14:34,448
有灯光闪动
on a place about a mile from the rock.

617
01:14:35,478 --> 01:14:39,498
有些问题可以解决 有些解决不了
There's some questions got answers and some haven't.

618
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:49,197
不 一定有更多可以直接解决的问题
No. There'll be a solution turn up directly, more'n likely.

619
01:14:52,246 --> 01:14:53,500
是绑架吧
A kidnappin'.

620
01:14:55,606 --> 01:15:00,403
哦 你知道 类似那样的事
Or, you know, something like that.

621
01:15:02,222 --> 01:15:04,795
她们可能掉入了一个山洞中
They might have fallen down a hole.

622
01:15:09,211 --> 01:15:13,484
不 不 有解决的某种办法
No, no. There's a solution somewhere, all right.

623
01:15:14,955 --> 01:15:16,513
一定有的
There's gotta be.

624
01:15:17,073 --> 01:15:19,372
过来 过来
Come over here. Come on.

625
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:21,080
到这来
Over here.

626
01:15:25,768 --> 01:15:30,443
年轻人 你知道世上有会动的植物吗 
Did you know, lad, there are some plants that can move?

627
01:15:31,609 --> 01:15:33,111
不知道
No.

628
01:15:57,859 --> 01:16:01,111
鲁姆莉小姐说您想见我 亚普莉亚德夫人
Miss Lumley said you wanted to see me, Mrs. Appleyard.

629
01:16:01,257 --> 01:16:04,506
没错 进来吧
That is correct. Come in.

630
01:16:05,985 --> 01:16:07,507
请关上门
Close the door, please.

631
01:16:20,575 --> 01:16:24,842
我给你的监护人科斯格罗夫先生 写了几封信 萨拉
I have written several letters to your guardian, Mr. Cosgrove, Sara,

632
01:16:25,097 --> 01:16:28,508
但是我一直都没有收到回音
but I have not been favored with a reply thus far.

633
01:16:30,131 --> 01:16:33,508
实际上 自我收到上封信已经6个月了
In fact, it is all of six months since I have received a letter

634
01:16:35,526 --> 01:16:37,333
或者说是支票
or a check.

635
01:16:38,426 --> 01:16:42,891
因此 我只好取消你的另外收费项目
I, therefore, have no alternative but to cancel all your extras.

636
01:16:43,532 --> 01:16:45,510
这意味着 到现在为止
This means that, as of today,

637
01:16:45,510 --> 01:16:49,945
你不能再上舞蹈和绘画课了
you can no longer partake in dancing or drawing lessons.

638
01:16:50,698 --> 01:16:54,084
除非你的未付费用在复活节前付清
And unless all your outstanding fees are paid by Easter,

639
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:58,510
否则我只好另做安排了
I'm afraid we shall have to make other arrangements.

640
01:17:00,614 --> 01:17:03,492
你明白我的意思 是吗 萨拉 
You know what that means, don't you, Sara?

641
01:17:06,426 --> 01:17:08,391
你将必须离开
You will have to go away.

642
01:17:10,169 --> 01:17:15,314
有很多可以安置你这种情况的女孩的公共结构
There are places for girls in your predicament. Institutions.

643
01:17:22,610 --> 01:17:25,524
现在你可以走了
Now off you go.

644
01:17:26,321 --> 01:17:27,513
萨拉.
Sara.

645
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:55,187
萨拉 你怎么啦 
Sara! What's wrong with you?

646
01:17:57,173 --> 01:17:58,515
不舒服吗 
Are you feeling ill?

647
01:18:02,013 --> 01:18:03,210
除非脑子有问题的人
People don't sit on cold steps

648
01:18:03,210 --> 01:18:06,517
否则人们是不会在黑暗中坐在冰冷的台阶上
in the dark unless they're weak in the head.

649
01:18:10,212 --> 01:18:13,315
你已经听到铃声了 去洗手吃晚餐吧
You heard the bell. Go and wash for supper.

650
01:18:19,099 --> 01:18:20,518
你不饿吗 
Aren't you hungry?

651
01:18:24,267 --> 01:18:26,383
那你还是直接去睡觉吧
Well, you best go straight to bed.

652
01:18:34,335 --> 01:18:35,519
快点
Quickly.

653
01:18:43,201 --> 01:18:46,013
告诉老师我不想吃 谢谢
Tell Mademoiselle I don't want it. Thank you.

654
01:18:46,213 --> 01:18:50,215
你必须吃东西 不吃会生病
But you must eat. You'll get sick if you don't.

655
01:18:51,423 --> 01:18:52,997
我已经生病了
I'm sick already. If I eat that, I'll be even sicker.

656
01:18:53,077 --> 01:18:55,464
如果我吃的话 就病得更加厉害

657
01:18:55,642 --> 01:18:57,880
胡说 快点 萨拉小姐
Nonsense. Now come on, Miss Sara.

658
01:18:57,880 --> 01:18:59,422
你知道吗 明妮 
Do you know what, Minnie?

659
01:19:00,407 --> 01:19:01,625
不 知道什么 
No. What?

660
01:19:02,854 --> 01:19:05,428
我曾在孤儿院呆过
I was in an orphanage once.

661
01:19:06,071 --> 01:19:07,561
真的吗 萨拉 
Were you, Sara?

662
01:19:12,606 --> 01:19:17,751
我有个弟弟… 叫波蒂
I had a brother then... called Bertie.

663
01:19:26,505 --> 01:19:31,073
我告诉保姆我想成为马戏团的女骑手
I told the matron I wanted to be a lady circus rider

664
01:19:31,073 --> 01:19:34,272
穿着漂亮的衣服骑着白马
on a white horse with a spangled dress.

665
01:19:37,733 --> 01:19:42,437
她害怕我会逃跑 因此给我剃头
She was afraid I'd run away, so she shaved my head.

666
01:19:44,153 --> 01:19:47,524
我咬她的胳膊流血了
I bit her arm. It bled.

667
01:19:49,868 --> 01:19:53,525
因此她就用紫罗兰在我头上乱画
So she painted my head with gentian violet.

668
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:30,454
我爱你 亲爱的
I love you, darlin'.

669
01:20:33,273 --> 01:20:36,261
我为那些孩子感到惋惜
I feel sorry for them kids.

670
01:20:39,798 --> 01:20:42,159
你是说悬崖上的那几个孩子 
The ones on the rock, you mean?

671
01:20:42,741 --> 01:20:44,530
是的
Yeah, them too.

672
01:20:46,573 --> 01:20:52,208
我还在想 在学院的那个可怜的小恶魔 
I was thinkin' of them other poor little devils, here at the college.

673
01:20:54,545 --> 01:20:58,315
她们 她们都不会有事的
Them. They're all right.

674
01:20:59,037 --> 01:21:01,430
她们大多数都非常有钱
Rollin' in cash, most of them.

675
01:21:02,089 --> 01:21:04,074
至少他们的父母有钱
Or at least their mothers and fathers are.

676
01:21:04,074 --> 01:21:06,316
而另外一些人是孤儿
Some of them are orphans

677
01:21:07,682 --> 01:21:10,543
或者是受监护人 或者… 
or wards or...

678
01:21:10,543 --> 01:21:12,532
你知道
You know.

679
01:21:42,493 --> 01:21:43,981
现在我知道了
[Thinking] Now I know.

680
01:21:45,446 --> 01:21:49,535
你知道什么 你知道什么 
What do you know? What do you know?

681
01:21:51,794 --> 01:21:56,506
我知道米兰达 是一个波提切利天使
I know that Miranda is a Botticelli angel.

682
01:22:27,925 --> 01:22:30,862
保持姿式先生们 
Hold it right there. Thanks, gentlemen.

683
01:22:31,172 --> 01:22:34,270
就这样笑 开心点 谢谢 
That's it. Smile, please.

684
01:22:35,281 --> 01:22:36,994
谢谢 谢谢
Thank you, thank you.

685
01:22:42,126 --> 01:22:46,025
叫那些女士过来
Get those women over here, please.

686
01:22:51,850 --> 01:22:53,551
那根绳子不是呢绒
The rope. Not that stuff. The other.

687
01:22:54,247 --> 01:22:55,552
把那根绳子给我
Give me that rope over here.

688
01:22:56,211 --> 01:22:58,367
来喝杯茶吧
(man #2) What about a cup of tea up here?

689
01:22:58,998 --> 01:23:00,405
啊 茶
Ah, tea. Ah.

690
01:23:03,553 --> 01:23:05,542
哈罗 
Hello!

691
01:23:15,642 --> 01:23:16,873
好的 好的
Good, good.

692
01:23:18,106 --> 01:23:19,832
往上看 往上 
As if looking up. Right up.

693
01:23:20,035 --> 01:23:22,522
就那样找个洞什么的
That's it. Looking for a cave or something like that.

694
01:23:22,522 --> 01:23:25,671
脸上的表情要丰富点 先生
Little more expression in the face, sir.

695
01:23:33,951 --> 01:23:35,282
哈罗 厄玛
Hello, Irma.

696
01:23:39,521 --> 01:23:42,139
菲兹伯格太太带我进来的
Madame Fitzhubert showed me in.

697
01:23:46,623 --> 01:23:48,238
你感觉怎样 
How do you feel?

698
01:23:53,524 --> 01:23:54,587
噢 厄玛 
Oh, Irma!

699
01:23:55,806 --> 01:23:57,233
噢 厄玛.
Oh, Irma.

700
01:23:59,184 --> 01:24:01,397
我们以为永远失去你了
We thought you had gone forever.

701
01:24:08,314 --> 01:24:11,548
让我好好看看你 亲爱的
Let me look at you, cherie.

702
01:24:13,375 --> 01:24:14,749
你好苍白
You are so pale

703
01:24:16,329 --> 01:24:18,339
但是比以前更漂亮了
but prettier than ever.

我 我什么也记不起来了
I, I remember... nothing. [Crying]

710
01:24:46,322 --> 01:24:48,809
我什么也记不得了

711

717
01:27:49,846 --> 01:27:54,229

722
01:28:31,208 --> 01:28:32,571
秘密
Secrets.

723
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:41,707
她知道她不会回来
She knew she wouldn't come back.

724
01:28:52,180 --> 01:28:54,176
范妮 你的步调不一致  
Fanny, you are ridiculously out of step.

725
01:28:54,254 --> 01:28:56,272
请注意音乐节奏
 Pay attention to the music, please!

726
01:29:19,237 --> 01:29:21,282
对不起 鲁姆莉小姐

我们可爱的厄玛来看大家
Our dear Irma is with us but for a few hours.

730
01:29:26,635 --> 01:29:28,764
但只有几个小时时间
She is leaving soon

731
01:29:30,084 --> 01:29:33,576
她马上就要离开 回到欧洲她父母的身边
to join her parents in Europe.

732
01:29:36,742 --> 01:29:37,587
（法语）
[Chuckles] Alors, mes enfants.

733
01:29:38,012 --> 01:29:41,028
给你们10分钟交谈的时间
For ten minutes, you may talk as you choose.

734
01:29:41,552 --> 01:29:43,440
如果您批准的话 鲁姆莉小姐

742
01:30:27,592 --> 01:30:31,542
告诉我们 厄玛 快告诉我们 
They're dead! All dead and gone, Irma!

743
01:30:31,592 --> 01:30:36,126
她们死了 她们都死了 厄玛 
[All shouting at once]

744
01:30:36,593 --> 01:30:39,076
她会去你认识的地方 
She's going to you know where!

745
01:30:40,709 --> 01:30:43,034
你是个骗子 傻瓜 
You are a liar and a fool!

746
01:31:10,071 --> 01:31:11,447
玛德莫瑟莉（老师） 
(Sara) Mademoiselle?

747
01:31:13,565 --> 01:31:17,585
这样对她也好 可以治愈她恐怖的堕落 
It's for her own good! To cure her terrible stooping!

748
01:31:36,697 --> 01:31:38,587
进来
Come in.

749
01:31:46,867 --> 01:31:50,081
怎么啦 进来吧
Well? Come in.

750
01:32:02,351 --> 01:32:04,076
夫人 这是我的辞呈
My notice, ma'am.

751
01:32:52,974 --> 01:32:55,339
房间里有病人吗 
Have we an invalid in the house?

752
01:32:56,033 --> 01:32:57,989
这是萨拉小姐的晚餐 夫人
Miss Sara's supper, ma'am.

753
01:32:58,273 --> 01:33:01,527
玛德莫瑟莉叫我看看 那孩子是否好了
Mademoiselle asked me, seeing as the child's feeling poorly.

754
01:33:01,835 --> 01:33:04,309
噢明妮 
Oh. Minnie!

755
01:33:04,607 --> 01:33:05,437
嗯 
Hmm?

756
01:33:06,021 --> 01:33:10,649
叫萨拉小姐 不要关灯我要和她谈谈
Tell Miss Sara not to put her light out until I've had a word with her.

757
01:33:10,649 --> 01:33:12,148
好的 夫人
Yes, ma'am.

758
01:33:22,628 --> 01:33:25,596
这里不是慈善机构
[Whispering] This is not a charitable institution.

759
01:33:39,626 --> 01:33:43,597
你在回忆我们最近的谈话吗 萨拉 
You recall our recent discussion, Sara.

760
01:33:45,519 --> 01:33:48,376
我问话的时候要回答 孩子
Answer me when I address you, child.

761
01:33:49,221 --> 01:33:50,366
是的
Yes.

762
01:33:50,876 --> 01:33:55,078
我很仔细地考虑过你目前的处境
I have considered your situation most carefully,

763
01:33:56,125 --> 01:33:59,891
我绞尽脑汁 想找出一个两全其美的办法
and I have searched my mind and my conscience for a solution.

764
01:34:01,174 --> 01:34:04,399
但是 这里不是慈善机构
But this is not a charitable institution.

765
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:08,354
而你的学费还没有到
And as your fees have not been forthcoming,

766
01:34:08,757 --> 01:34:13,052
出于对你的考虑 我被迫作出决定
I have been forced to make certain arrangements on your behalf.

767
01:34:15,786 --> 01:34:18,896
你必须返回孤儿院
You will be returned to the orphanage.

768
01:35:55,533 --> 01:35:57,273
你还在想那该死的岩石的事 
(Albert) You still thinking about that bloody rock?

769
01:35:57,273 --> 01:35:59,155
我控制不住自己
I can't help it.

770
01:35:59,703 --> 01:36:01,691
它每晚都会出现在我的梦中
It comes back at night in dreams.

771
01:36:03,489 --> 01:36:06,042
昨晚我做了一个有趣的梦
I had a funny dream last night.

772
01:36:06,688 --> 01:36:09,694
现在还记忆犹新
There was this smell. Real strong.

773
01:36:11,351 --> 01:36:15,889
我似乎是醒着 周围死一样的静
It was like, like I was wide awake. Dead quiet.

774
01:36:16,737 --> 01:36:18,918
三色紫罗兰就是这样的气味
Pansies. That's what it smelt like.

775
01:36:18,918 --> 01:36:22,611
整个地方都亮堂起来 亮如白昼
And the whole place was all lit up, bright as day.

776
01:36:25,630 --> 01:36:27,868
而外面像沥青一样黑
Pitch black outside.

777
01:36:29,044 --> 01:36:30,720
接着她来了
And there she is.

778
01:36:32,006 --> 01:36:33,054
谁来了 
Who was it?

779
01:36:33,524 --> 01:36:35,843
那只是一个该死的梦 
It was only a bloody dream!

780
01:36:39,066 --> 01:36:42,924
是我的姐姐 自孤儿院分别后就没见过她
My kid sister. Haven't seen her since the orphanage.

781
01:36:43,081 --> 01:36:45,585
她一直都喜欢三色紫罗兰
She always liked pansies.

782
01:36:47,339 --> 01:36:52,610
她消失在好像迷雾一样的东西中
And she went all sort of... misty-like.

783
01:36:55,113 --> 01:37:00,056
我大叫着 萨拉 不要走. 
I calls out, "Sara, don't go yet."

784
01:37:02,379 --> 01:37:04,469
她说 拜拜 波蒂. 
"Good-bye, Bertie," she says.

785
01:37:04,669 --> 01:37:09,343
我远道来看你 现在我必须走了. 
"I've come a long way to see ya, and now I must go."

786
01:37:10,074 --> 01:37:11,945
接着她就消失了
And she went.

787
01:37:13,917 --> 01:37:15,959
清晰得就像那堵墙
Clear through that wall over there.

788
01:37:25,390 --> 01:37:27,228
坐吧 玛德莫瑟莉
Sit down, please, Mademoiselle.

789
01:37:27,305 --> 01:37:28,541
谢谢
Merci.

790
01:37:29,373 --> 01:37:32,578
昨晚我们在谈那个 维伯尼女孩的事
We were speaking last night about the Waybourne girl.

791
01:37:32,628 --> 01:37:36,329
你对她的健康状况 非常的关心
You expressed concern over the state of her health.

792
01:37:36,529 --> 01:37:37,629
是的 夫人
Yes, madame.

793
01:37:38,283 --> 01:37:41,502
对于这些责任我们非常放心
We have been relieved of any further responsibility.

794
01:37:41,782 --> 01:37:44,841
她的监护人科斯格罗夫先生今天上午到了
Her guardian, Mr. Cosgrove, arrived this morning

795
01:37:44,841 --> 01:37:47,122
并把她一道接走了
and took her away with him.

796
01:37:51,048 --> 01:37:55,389
只是… 她能远行吗 
That's... But was she fit enough to travel?

797
01:37:55,919 --> 01:37:57,620
很显然可以
Apparently.

798
01:37:58,448 --> 01:38:00,806
我本应该来为她收拾东西
I should have been here to supervise her packing.

799
01:38:00,806 --> 01:38:03,862
我本人想帮萨拉 收拾几样她非常想要的东西
I, myself, helped Sara put a few things she especially wanted

800
01:38:03,862 --> 01:38:06,002
放进她可爱的有盖的篮子里
into her little covered basket.

801
01:38:06,002 --> 01:38:08,608
科斯格罗夫先生急着离开
Mr. Cosgrove was in a hurry to get away.

802
01:38:08,980 --> 01:38:11,106
我就不吃午餐了 玛德莫瑟莉
I shall not be coming into luncheon, Mademoiselle.

803
01:38:11,106 --> 01:38:13,612
最好告诉他们不要给我留位置了
Kindly tell them not to lay a place for me.

804
01:38:13,612 --> 01:38:15,899
也不用为萨拉留位置吗 
Nor for Sara?

805
01:38:16,437 --> 01:38:17,620
不用了
Nor for Sara.

806
01:38:22,765 --> 01:38:26,337
你脸上的是胭脂吗 玛德莫瑟莉 
Is that rouge I see on your cheek, Mademoiselle?

807
01:38:27,377 --> 01:38:31,726
是粉末 夫人 我认为它比较合适
Powder, madame. I find it becoming.

808
01:38:36,346 --> 01:38:37,926
噢 天哪
Oh, God.

809
01:38:51,553 --> 01:38:52,635

823

40年过去了依然如此
Ever. For 40 years.

824
01:40:17,030 --> 01:40:20,913
那里的码头 那里的沙滩和人们
The pier, the sands and the people.

825
01:40:21,913 --> 01:40:24,074
还有那里的客人屋

非常非常的可靠
Completely and utterly dependable.

828
01:40:35,829 --> 01:40:37,745
还要吗 玛德莫瑟莉 
A little more, Mademoiselle?

829
01:40:37,867 --> 01:40:39,075
不用了 夫人
No, madame.

830
01:40:40,387 --> 01:40:42,276
随便你吧
As you wish.

831
01:40:52,094 --> 01:40:56,041
我来这里 全靠格里塔 ・ 迈克劳
I came to depend so much on Greta McCraw.

832
01:40:56,796 --> 01:40:59,323
她非常的聪明
So much masculine intellect.

833
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:02,675
我全依靠着这个女人
I came to rely on that woman.

834
01:41:03,034 --> 01:41:04,575
我相信她
Trust her.

835
01:41:04,925 --> 01:41:08,378
她怎么可以让别人把她拐跑 
How could she allow herself to be spirited away?

836
01:41:09,420 --> 01:41:10,824
失踪
Lost.

837
01:41:11,767 --> 01:41:13,404
被人强暴
Raped.

838
01:41:13,404 --> 01:41:17,636
像一个愚蠢的女学生一样被人谋杀在… 
Murdered in cold blood like a silly schoolgirl

839
01:41:18,266 --> 01:41:20,794
肮脏的海茵悬崖
on that wretched Hanging Rock.

840
01:41:28,875 --> 01:41:33,196
萨拉 ・ 维伯尼这个学期会回来吗 夫人 
Will Sara Waybourne be coming back this term, madame?

841
01:41:33,196 --> 01:41:34,075
噢 
Oh!

842
01:41:35,893 --> 01:41:38,015
