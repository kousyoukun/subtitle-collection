Miranda, somebody had the nerve to send
Miss McCraw a card on squared paper

00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,935
covered with tiny sums.

39
00:06:35,191 --> 00:06:37,234

Mrs Appleyard will see to it that
none of you go to Hanging Rock today.

Bonjour, Miss Lumley.

44
00:06:47,788 --> 00:06:50,122
Good morning, Mademoiselle de Poitiers.

45
00:06:54,002 --> 00:06:58,047
I believe Mrs Appleyard has decided
you're not to go on the picnic, Sara.

46
00:06:59,633 --> 00:07:01,676
That makes two of us.

47
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,471
Off you go!

51
00:07:46,847 --> 00:07:50,683

52
00:08:21,965 --> 00:08:24,925
- Good morning, girls.
- Good morning, Mrs Appleyard.

53
00:08:24,968 --> 00:08:26,594
Well, young ladies,

54
00:08:26,637 --> 00:08:29,889
we are indeed fortunate in the weather
for our picnic to Hanging Rock.

55
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:31,348
I have instructed Mademoiselle

56
00:08:31,391 --> 00:08:35,520
that as the day is likely to be warm,
you may remove your gloves

57
00:08:35,562 --> 00:08:38,481
once the drag has passed through Woodend.

58
00:08:38,524 --> 00:08:42,109
You will partake of luncheon
at the picnic grounds near the rock.

59
00:08:42,152 --> 00:08:47,322
Once again let me remind you that
the rock itself is extremely dangerous

60
00:08:47,365 --> 00:08:51,452
and you are therefore forbidden any tomboy
foolishness in the matter of exploration,

61
00:08:51,495 --> 00:08:52,953
even on the lower slopes.

62
00:08:52,996 --> 00:08:58,375
I also wish to remind you the vicinity
is renowned for its venomous snakes

63
00:08:58,419 --> 00:09:00,670
and poisonous ants of various species.

64
00:09:00,712 --> 00:09:04,131
It is, however, a geological marvel,

65
00:09:04,174 --> 00:09:08,385
on which you will be required to write
a brief essay on Monday morning.

66
00:09:08,429 --> 00:09:09,429
That is all.

67
00:09:09,471 --> 00:09:12,848
Have a pleasant day,
and try to behave yourselves

68
00:09:12,891 --> 00:09:15,309
in a manner to bring credit
to the college.

69
00:09:15,351 --> 00:09:18,813
Mr Hussey!

70
00:09:20,023 --> 00:09:23,984
I shall expect you back, Miss McCraw
and Mademoiselle, at about eight

71
00:09:24,027 --> 00:09:25,027
for a light supper.

72
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,361
Come, girls.

73
00:09:59,104 --> 00:10:00,980
This we do for pleasure

74
00:10:01,022 --> 00:10:06,235
so that we may shortly be at the mercy of
venomous snakes and poisonous ants.

75
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,364
How foolish can human creatures be?

76
00:11:05,462 --> 00:11:08,297
There she is, ladies. Hangin' Rock.

77
00:11:12,177 --> 00:11:17,139
The mountain comes to Mohammed.
A hanging rock comes to Mr Hussey.

78
00:11:19,267 --> 00:11:25,272
More than 500 feet high she is. Volcanic,
of course. Thousands of years old.

79
00:11:25,315 --> 00:11:28,734
A million years old, Mr Hussey,
or thereabouts.

80
00:11:28,777 --> 00:11:32,655
Yes, well, of course that'd be right.

81
00:11:32,698 --> 00:11:34,740
Thousands, millions.

82
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:39,412
Devil of a long time, anyway,
in a manner of speakin'.

83
00:11:39,455 --> 00:11:44,041
Only a million years ago.
Quite a recent eruption, really.

84
00:11:45,669 --> 00:11:49,505
The rocks all around
Mount Macedon itself

85
00:11:49,548 --> 00:11:52,675
must be all of 350 million years old.

86
00:11:55,136 --> 00:11:57,137
Siliceous lava...

87
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:01,141
...forced up from deep down below.

88
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:08,148
Soda trachytes extruded in
a highly viscous state,

89
00:12:08,191 --> 00:12:13,112
building the steep-sided mametons
we see in Hanging Rock.

90
00:12:15,323 --> 00:12:19,869
And quite young, geologically speaking.
Barely a million years.

91
00:12:21,497 --> 00:12:25,666
Waiting a million years... just for us.

92
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,822
More cake, Michael?

93
00:12:58,283 --> 00:13:00,117
No, thank you, Aunt. l’m...

94
00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:03,996
I think I'll just, um,
stretch my legs a bit.

95
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:07,583
Oh, don't go too far... and be careful.

96
00:13:07,626 --> 00:13:09,752
There could be snakes.

97
00:13:46,498 --> 00:13:49,792
- How's it goin'?
- All right.

98
00:13:51,211 --> 00:13:53,212
They finished eating, have they?

99
00:13:54,214 --> 00:13:55,214
Pardon?

100
00:13:57,008 --> 00:13:58,676
The colonel and the missus.

101
00:13:58,719 --> 00:14:01,095
- They finished eating, have they?
- Oh, yes, they have.

102
00:14:04,182 --> 00:14:07,267
Expect me up there in a minute, I suppose.
Clear away.

103
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:15,985
- Can't be more'n midday.
- No.

104
00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:23,033
I thought it was a little early
for lunch myself.

105
00:14:23,076 --> 00:14:24,660
Yeah.

106
00:14:27,372 --> 00:14:28,623
Drink?

107
00:14:28,665 --> 00:14:30,290
Thank you.

108
00:14:36,131 --> 00:14:40,718
You know, they always allow an hour
longer than it takes to get 'ere,

109
00:14:40,761 --> 00:14:43,220
and then they got 'ere straight away.

110
00:14:44,515 --> 00:14:45,890
Thanks.

111
00:14:52,648 --> 00:14:53,898
Ta!

112
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,610
Not that they got anything else to do.

113
00:14:57,653 --> 00:15:00,154
I mean, they never go for
a walk or nothin'.

114
00:15:15,671 --> 00:15:19,339
Get on! Come on!

115
00:16:01,091 --> 00:16:05,511
To St Valentine!
To St Valentine!

116
00:16:25,657 --> 00:16:28,242
I hope you have learned
your poetry, Sara.

117
00:16:29,244 --> 00:16:30,620
Sit up straight, child.

118
00:16:30,662 --> 00:16:33,956
Hold your shoulders back.
You're getting a dreadful stoop.

119
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:37,376
Well, have you got your lines by heart?

120
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:39,712
Well, have you?

121
00:16:40,714 --> 00:16:43,340
I can't. It doesn't make sense.

122
00:16:43,383 --> 00:16:46,636
Sense? You little ignoramus!

123
00:16:46,678 --> 00:16:48,137
Evidently you don't know

124
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:52,975
that Mrs Felicia Heymans is considered
one of the finest of our English poets.

125
00:16:53,977 --> 00:16:56,562
I know another piece of poetry by heart.

126
00:16:56,605 --> 00:17:00,733
It has ever so many verses, much more
than 'The Wreck of the Hesperus'.

127
00:17:00,776 --> 00:17:01,901
Would that do?

128
00:17:01,943 --> 00:17:03,861
What is the name of this poem?

129
00:17:03,904 --> 00:17:05,946
'An Ode to St Valentine'.

130
00:17:05,989 --> 00:17:08,949
l’m not acquainted with it.
Where did you find it?

131
00:17:08,992 --> 00:17:11,160
I didn't find it. I wrote it.

132
00:17:11,202 --> 00:17:13,078
You wrote it?

133
00:17:15,457 --> 00:17:18,083
'Love abounds, love surrounds'

134
00:17:18,126 --> 00:17:23,005
Oh, no thank you, Sara. Strange as it
may seem, I still prefer Mrs Heymans.

135
00:17:23,048 --> 00:17:26,801
Give me your book and proceed to
recite to me as far as you have gone.

136
00:17:27,969 --> 00:17:29,929
Your book, please, Sara.

137
00:17:31,557 --> 00:17:33,140
Thank you.

138
00:17:34,392 --> 00:17:35,601
Go on.

139
00:17:36,603 --> 00:17:38,187
I can't.

140
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,273
Not one line?

141
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,736
I shall leave you now, Sara.

142
00:17:45,779 --> 00:17:50,491
I expect you to be word perfect when
I send Miss Lumley in in half an hour.

143
00:17:50,534 --> 00:17:53,327
Otherwise, l’m afraid I shall have to
send you to bed

144
00:17:53,369 --> 00:17:57,164
instead of letting you stay up until
the others return from the picnic.

145
00:18:10,386 --> 00:18:14,724
Bertie! Bertie!

146
00:18:14,766 --> 00:18:17,768
Jesus, where are you?

147
00:18:20,313 --> 00:18:22,189
Oh, Miranda!

148
00:18:31,116 --> 00:18:32,908
I like this one.

149
00:18:32,951 --> 00:18:36,787
'Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?

150
00:18:38,331 --> 00:18:42,460
'Thou art more lovely and
more temperate.

151
00:18:42,503 --> 00:18:46,464
'Rough winds do shake
the darling buds of May,

152
00:18:46,507 --> 00:18:50,092
'And summer's lease hath
all too short a date. '

153
00:18:56,224 --> 00:18:59,351
That's funny!

154
00:18:59,394 --> 00:19:01,979
Blowed if me watch hasn't stopped.

155
00:19:04,357 --> 00:19:07,026
Dead on 12.00.

156
00:19:10,906 --> 00:19:12,698
That's real funny.

157
00:19:14,117 --> 00:19:16,035
C'est très jolie, n'est-ce pas?

158
00:19:18,997 --> 00:19:21,832
You wouldn't have the time,
I suppose, miss?

159
00:19:25,587 --> 00:19:29,256
Ah, Miranda, your pretty
little diamond watch.

160
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:31,050
Don't wear it any more.

161
00:19:31,092 --> 00:19:33,719
Can't stand the ticking above my heart.

162
00:19:36,557 --> 00:19:42,144
If it were mine I'd wear it always,
even in the bath.

163
00:19:42,187 --> 00:19:45,690
Would you, Mr Hussey?

164
00:19:50,278 --> 00:19:53,238
Stopped at twelve.

165
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,866
Never stopped before.

166
00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:57,868
Must be something magnetic.

167
00:19:57,911 --> 00:20:00,871
Well after two, I'd say.

168
00:20:00,914 --> 00:20:02,832
We'd better be careful.

169
00:20:02,874 --> 00:20:07,503
I promised Mrs Appleyard I'd have
you lot back at the college by eight.

170
00:20:12,008 --> 00:20:14,719
Except for those people down there,

171
00:20:14,761 --> 00:20:18,514
we might be the only living creatures
in the whole world.

172
00:20:34,573 --> 00:20:37,116
- Excuse me, Mam'selle.
- Yes, Marion?

173
00:20:37,158 --> 00:20:40,745
I should like to make a few measurements
at the base of the rock if we have time.

174
00:20:40,787 --> 00:20:42,622
With Miranda and Irma.

175
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:47,376
Oh, please, Mam'selle.

176
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,505
We'll be back long before tea.

177
00:20:53,091 --> 00:20:55,050
Et bien. Allez!

178
00:20:57,178 --> 00:20:58,888
May I come too, please?

179
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:01,306
So long as you don't complain.

180
00:21:01,349 --> 00:21:03,100
I won't. I promise.

181
00:21:03,143 --> 00:21:08,105
And don't worry about us, Mam'selle.
We shall only be gone a little while.

182
00:21:29,711 --> 00:21:31,504
Now I know.

183
00:21:32,714 --> 00:21:34,298
What do you know?

184
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:41,096
I know that Miranda is a Botticelli angel.

185
00:22:05,831 --> 00:22:07,582
Wait!

186
00:22:18,384 --> 00:22:20,928
Can you manage it, Edith?
- I don't know.

187
00:22:23,724 --> 00:22:26,642
I don't want to get my feet wet.

188
00:22:32,899 --> 00:22:34,442
Oh!

189
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:44,577
Thought the little fat one
was gonna take a bath.

190
00:22:47,956 --> 00:22:49,707
Some of them are real lookers.

191
00:22:51,418 --> 00:22:54,420
Have a look at the shape of
the dark one with the curls.

192
00:22:55,422 --> 00:22:57,423
Built like an hourglass.

193
00:23:00,301 --> 00:23:03,220
And 'ave a go at the last one!
The blonde!

194
00:23:04,222 --> 00:23:08,142
Oh, she'd have a decent pair a' legs.

195
00:23:08,184 --> 00:23:10,352
All the way up to her bum.

196
00:23:10,395 --> 00:23:13,313
l’d rather you didn't say
crude things like that, Albert.

197
00:23:14,691 --> 00:23:18,486
I say the crude things.
You just think 'em.

198
00:23:18,529 --> 00:23:19,945
Miranda!

199
00:23:21,114 --> 00:23:22,322
Take my word for it.

200
00:23:22,365 --> 00:23:25,284
The Sheilas are all alike
when it comes to fellas.

201
00:23:26,703 --> 00:23:29,830
Doesn't matter if it's a bloody
college you come from

202
00:23:29,873 --> 00:23:33,876
or the Ballarat Orphanage where
me and me kid sister was dragged up.

203
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,961
Didn't know you were an orphan.

204
00:23:36,004 --> 00:23:41,341
Geez! I haven't thought of that
bloody dump in donkeys' years.

205
00:23:56,608 --> 00:23:58,568
Miranda!

206
00:24:07,494 --> 00:24:11,539
I think I'll just, er... stretch my legs
a bit before we go.

207
00:25:24,571 --> 00:25:26,155
Look!

208
00:25:27,866 --> 00:25:31,994
Not down at the ground, Edith.
Way up there in the sky.

209
00:27:03,294 --> 00:27:08,424
Why can't we just sit on this log and
look at the ugly old rock from here?

210
00:27:11,177 --> 00:27:13,053
It's nasty here!

211
00:27:13,096 --> 00:27:17,099
I never thought it would be so nasty,
or I wouldn't have come!

212
00:28:16,868 --> 00:28:18,828
We can't go much further.

213
00:28:20,038 --> 00:28:22,081
We promised Mam'selle...

214
00:28:24,209 --> 00:28:26,210
...we wouldn't be long away.

215
00:28:44,312 --> 00:28:49,484
If only we could stay out all night...
and watch the moon rise.

216
00:28:51,069 --> 00:28:54,614
Blanche said Sara writes poetry
in the dunny!

217
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:58,451
She found one there on the floor
all about Miranda.

218
00:29:00,161 --> 00:29:02,037
She's an orphan.

219
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,006
Sara reminds me of a little deer
Papa brought home once.

220
00:29:14,259 --> 00:29:15,843
I looked after it...

221
00:29:16,845 --> 00:29:18,262
...but it died.

222
00:29:21,141 --> 00:29:23,183
Mama always said it was doomed.

223
00:29:25,521 --> 00:29:27,688
Doomed? What's that mean, Irma?

224
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:30,650
Doomed to die, of course.

225
00:29:30,692 --> 00:29:36,071
'The boy stood on the burning deck,
whence all but he had fled, tra la... '

226
00:29:36,114 --> 00:29:37,740
I forget the rest.

227
00:29:37,783 --> 00:29:40,367
I think I must be doomed.

228
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:44,622
I don't feel at all well.

229
00:29:44,665 --> 00:29:47,500
I do wish you'd stop talking for once.

230
00:29:49,294 --> 00:29:52,588
Poor Edith. We'll go back soon.

231
00:31:12,043 --> 00:31:14,086
Irma! Look at them!

232
00:31:17,841 --> 00:31:20,175
Where in the world are they going?

233
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,845
Without their shoes!

234
00:31:25,641 --> 00:31:29,977
Irma, wait! Wait for me! Please wait!

235
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,771
Wait, Irma, wait!

236
00:31:39,112 --> 00:31:42,197
Whatever can those people
be doing down there?

237
00:31:43,199 --> 00:31:44,825
Like a lot of ants.

238
00:31:46,327 --> 00:31:50,623
Surprising the number of human beings
are without purpose.

239
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:58,423
Although it is probable they're performing
some function unknown to themselves.

240
00:32:10,101 --> 00:32:14,605
Everything begins and ends...

241
00:32:16,066 --> 00:32:21,529
...at exactly the right time and place.

242
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:22,572
Look!

243
00:34:20,482 --> 00:34:25,570
Oh, Miranda, I feel awful
... really awful.

244
00:34:29,491 --> 00:34:32,284
Miranda, I feel perfectly awful.

245
00:34:32,327 --> 00:34:39,959
When are we going home?

246
00:34:45,882 --> 00:34:46,882
Miranda?

247
00:34:50,596 --> 00:34:52,555
Miranda!

248
00:34:55,684 --> 00:34:57,727
Miranda!

249
00:34:58,937 --> 00:35:02,231
Miranda, don't go up there!
Come back!

250
00:35:36,517 --> 00:35:39,685
I've gotta go. That's Mrs Appleyard.

251
00:35:39,728 --> 00:35:41,145
Let someone else go.

252
00:35:41,187 --> 00:35:43,313
They won't. No. l’m on.

253
00:35:43,356 --> 00:35:45,608
What time is it?

254
00:35:52,282 --> 00:35:55,117
What've you got to do?

255
00:35:58,371 --> 00:36:01,624
- Mrs Appleyard'll skin me.
- We got plenty of time.

256
00:36:13,011 --> 00:36:14,929
You'd better go.

257
00:36:44,375 --> 00:36:46,502
Why are they so late?

258
00:37:16,908 --> 00:37:18,576
God be praised!

259
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,965
Mademoiselle, why are you so late?

260
00:37:33,008 --> 00:37:37,219
Madame... something terrible has happened.

261
00:37:37,262 --> 00:37:39,514
What?

262
00:37:39,556 --> 00:37:40,681
What do you mean?

263
00:37:40,724 --> 00:37:42,558
I can't...

264
00:37:42,601 --> 00:37:44,477
And where in heaven's name is
Miss McCraw?

265
00:37:45,687 --> 00:37:47,438
We left her behind

266
00:37:47,481 --> 00:37:49,565
at the rock.

267
00:37:49,608 --> 00:37:50,900
You left her behind?

268
00:37:52,486 --> 00:37:55,530
Has everyone taken leave
of their senses?

269
00:37:55,572 --> 00:37:58,783
Miss Lumley, get these girls to
bed immediately.

270
00:37:58,825 --> 00:38:02,077
And Cook, Cook!
Hot soup, please, for all of them.

271
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:07,958
Mrs Appleyard...
I must speak to you alone.

272
00:38:08,001 --> 00:38:09,376
Very well.

273
00:38:16,677 --> 00:38:20,805
Straight up the stairs, girls.
Come along, quickly as you can.

274
00:38:20,847 --> 00:38:22,932
Cook, I asked you for hot soup!

275
00:38:35,904 --> 00:38:38,948
Well, ma'am... ma'am,

276
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:41,576
the strength of it is this.

277
00:38:43,203 --> 00:38:45,705
Three of your young ladies...

278
00:38:46,873 --> 00:38:50,084
...and, er... Miss McCraw...

279
00:38:51,377 --> 00:38:53,253
...are m-missing...

280
00:38:54,631 --> 00:38:56,048
...on the rock.

281
00:38:58,259 --> 00:38:59,301
What happened?

282
00:39:01,722 --> 00:39:03,639
Well, now, Mrs Appleyard.

283
00:39:04,766 --> 00:39:06,476
That's just the trouble.

284
00:39:07,728 --> 00:39:10,646
Nobody knows what happened.

285
00:39:13,316 --> 00:39:16,611
How soon after the girls
did Miss McCraw leave?

286
00:39:16,653 --> 00:39:20,322
Don't know. No one knows.

287
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,368
No one saw her leave. We were asleep.

288
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:28,998
And the little one?

289
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,333
Edith Horton.

290
00:39:33,629 --> 00:39:35,505
Like I told ya,

291
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:40,885
she come tearin' out of the bushes,
dress all torn,

292
00:39:42,095 --> 00:39:44,054
screamin' fit to...

293
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:51,311
Well, after we'd shushed her screamin',
all we could get out of her was that

294
00:39:51,354 --> 00:39:54,774
she'd left the other three
somewhere up on the rock.

295
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:01,864
That's about all I can tell ya.

296
00:40:03,909 --> 00:40:08,413
Miranda!

297
00:40:14,836 --> 00:40:20,925
Marion!

298
00:40:21,176 --> 00:40:23,218
Irma!

299
00:40:51,331 --> 00:40:52,331
Go on, get out of it.

300
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:56,752
Ah, stop it!

301
00:41:00,381 --> 00:41:01,882
Come on.

302
00:41:05,011 --> 00:41:06,887
Miranda!

303
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:25,656
Try to remember, Edith...

304
00:41:30,328 --> 00:41:33,789
...what it was that frightened you
on the rock.

305
00:41:37,794 --> 00:41:40,421
Think carefully, darling. Carefully!

306
00:41:42,007 --> 00:41:44,049
Did you speak to anyone?

307
00:41:46,052 --> 00:41:48,513
There must have been something.

308
00:41:49,806 --> 00:41:51,682
Was there a man?

309
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:01,609
Her legs were quite severely scratched.

310
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:04,987
From running through the brambles,
I should imagine.

311
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:11,076
Nothing else?

312
00:42:15,916 --> 00:42:17,917
Nothing I could detect.

313
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,509
She hadn't been...

314
00:42:27,803 --> 00:42:29,219
...molested?

315
00:42:29,262 --> 00:42:31,972
No, no, nothing like that.

316
00:42:32,015 --> 00:42:34,684
I have examined her.

317
00:42:34,726 --> 00:42:37,394
She is quite intact.

318
00:42:50,325 --> 00:42:54,954
Since you won't tell me all the details,
how can I give you an opinion, Lionel?

319
00:42:55,956 --> 00:42:58,373
There are no details.

320
00:42:58,417 --> 00:43:01,376
People just don't disappear, my dear.

321
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,378
Not without good reason.

322
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,507
There's talk, is there?

323
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:08,300
Not just gossip.

324
00:43:08,343 --> 00:43:10,135
People have...

325
00:43:10,178 --> 00:43:11,345
...theories.

326
00:43:11,387 --> 00:43:12,513
Go on.

327
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:15,057
Well, it couldn't be local.

328
00:43:16,602 --> 00:43:17,768
What couldn't?

329
00:43:17,811 --> 00:43:21,021
No one around here would
do a thing like that.

330
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:23,899
l’ve just told you, Sergeant.

331
00:43:23,942 --> 00:43:26,402
I simply noticed these three young ladies
crossing the creek.

332
00:43:27,446 --> 00:43:28,863
What did they look like?

333
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:33,576
The girls. Describe them to me.

334
00:43:36,371 --> 00:43:38,873
The first one was tall and dark.

335
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:44,754
... then there was the little dumpy one.

336
00:43:44,796 --> 00:43:47,172
... then a girl with glasses...

337
00:43:47,215 --> 00:43:48,924
...and...

338
00:43:48,967 --> 00:43:51,886
...the last one was... slim and fair.

339
00:43:53,388 --> 00:43:54,388
That's four.

340
00:43:57,768 --> 00:43:58,768
Pardon?

341
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:01,353
A few minutes ago you said
there was only three of them.

342
00:44:02,397 --> 00:44:04,231
Oh, oh, yes.

343
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:08,110
That's because the... dumpy one
was back a little.

344
00:44:10,321 --> 00:44:13,032
Then they... er... moved off
into the trees

345
00:44:13,074 --> 00:44:15,325
and that's the last we saw of them.

346
00:44:19,498 --> 00:44:21,874
Perhaps we could go a little higher.

347
00:44:24,377 --> 00:44:25,920
I was tired.

348
00:44:27,756 --> 00:44:29,757
I sat down on a log.

349
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,717
Which log, Edith? This one?

350
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,511
Look around you, darling.

351
00:44:33,554 --> 00:44:35,471
Maybe you can see it now.

352
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:38,683
Is that the one? You went that way?

353
00:44:38,725 --> 00:44:39,725
I don't know.

354
00:44:40,769 --> 00:44:44,188
I was tired. l’m tired now.

355
00:44:50,737 --> 00:44:52,822
There is one thing I remember.

356
00:44:52,864 --> 00:44:55,324
What do you remember, Edith? Tell us.

357
00:44:55,366 --> 00:44:59,119
It was when I was coming down,
when I was running.

358
00:45:00,414 --> 00:45:01,956
It was a cloud.

359
00:45:01,998 --> 00:45:03,666
What sort of a cloud?

360
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:06,335
It was red.

361
00:45:07,754 --> 00:45:11,674
I remember it clearly.
It was just after I passed Miss McCraw.

362
00:45:14,385 --> 00:45:15,928
Who did you say you saw?

363
00:45:15,971 --> 00:45:21,016
Miss McCraw. She was going up the hill
as I was going down.

364
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:22,267
Did she stop?

365
00:45:23,604 --> 00:45:24,604
Did you speak?

366
00:45:24,646 --> 00:45:27,147
No. She was too far away.

367
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:31,110
She was about as far away as those
dead trees are over there.

368
00:45:35,991 --> 00:45:37,908
She was funny.

369
00:45:37,951 --> 00:45:39,410
Funny?

370
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:42,955
How?

371
00:45:43,999 --> 00:45:45,124
l’d rather not say.

372
00:45:45,166 --> 00:45:49,003
You must, Edith.
It could be very important.

373
00:45:49,588 --> 00:45:50,921
It’s rude.

374
00:46:03,018 --> 00:46:04,727
Les pantalons.

375
00:46:05,854 --> 00:46:09,732
She had no skirt. Just les pantalons.

376
00:46:09,775 --> 00:46:10,775
Drawers?

377
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:15,279
You mean she was just
wearing drawers?

378
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,862
One last go.

379
00:46:58,532 --> 00:47:00,157
For the bloodhound.

380
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,373
Miranda.

381
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:35,651
Hello!

382
00:48:12,188 --> 00:48:15,525
Why didn't you tell us
you followed the four girls?

383
00:48:16,943 --> 00:48:18,444
Because...

384
00:48:21,156 --> 00:48:23,365
...I didn't exactly follow them.

385
00:48:23,409 --> 00:48:28,370
I just jumped across the creek and
walked towards the rock for a little way.

386
00:48:31,291 --> 00:48:32,291
I was curious.

387
00:48:36,672 --> 00:48:41,884
In England young ladies like that wouldn't
be allowed to go walking in the forest.

388
00:48:41,927 --> 00:48:43,594
Not alone, anyway.

389
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:47,515
But they'd gone by the time
l’d come out of the trees

390
00:48:47,558 --> 00:48:49,349
so I turned back.

391
00:48:55,356 --> 00:48:59,318
As the girls were jumping the creek...

392
00:49:00,946 --> 00:49:02,655
...what were you thinking of?

393
00:49:35,606 --> 00:49:37,189
Ah, Michael!

394
00:50:17,981 --> 00:50:20,190
Oh, Michael!

395
00:50:43,757 --> 00:50:46,258
The old man hired me
to look after the horses.

396
00:50:46,301 --> 00:50:50,054
l’m buggered if l’m gonna be a lackey
at a bloody garden party.

397
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:53,933
That's what I bloody well told 'im.

398
00:50:55,602 --> 00:50:57,186
More or less.

399
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:11,826
Had the bloodhound out the other day.

400
00:51:19,585 --> 00:51:21,961
I wake up every night in a cold sweat.

401
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,924
Just wondering if they're still alive.

402
00:51:27,968 --> 00:51:30,010
Yeah, well, the way I look at it is this.

403
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:34,264
If the bloody cop and the bloody abo
tracker and the bloody dog can't find 'em,

404
00:51:34,307 --> 00:51:37,226
well, no one bloody can.

405
00:51:38,394 --> 00:51:40,605
People have been bushed before today,

406
00:51:40,647 --> 00:51:43,398
and as far as l’m concerned,
that's the stone end of it.

407
00:51:43,442 --> 00:51:46,026
Well, it's not the end of it
as far as l’m concerned.

408
00:51:47,988 --> 00:51:49,405
They may be out there...

409
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:52,032
...dying of thirst on...

410
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:54,994
...on that infernal rock and...

411
00:51:55,996 --> 00:51:59,206
...you and I are sitting here
drinking cold bloody beer.

412
00:52:03,962 --> 00:52:06,547
That's where you and me's different.

413
00:52:12,095 --> 00:52:15,180
If you want my advice, the sooner
you forget the whole thing, the better.

414
00:52:15,223 --> 00:52:16,849
Well, I can't forget it, and I never will.

415
00:52:27,778 --> 00:52:32,072
l’m not great shakes on music, but I
reckon the governor must be leavin', eh?

416
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:36,786
Your auntie'll give you hell
if you're not on show.

417
00:52:36,828 --> 00:52:37,828
Albert.

418
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:42,792
I want to go back to the rock.

419
00:52:46,547 --> 00:52:48,548
To look for them.

420
00:52:50,801 --> 00:52:52,635
Will you come with me?

421
00:53:06,775 --> 00:53:08,526
Beautiful birds, them swans.

422
00:53:12,823 --> 00:53:14,156
A week in the bush.

423
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,536
They'd be dead by now.

424
00:53:21,748 --> 00:53:23,207
Then I'll go alone.

425
00:55:38,384 --> 00:55:39,844
Hello?

426
00:55:56,778 --> 00:55:58,362
Mike!

427
00:56:00,866 --> 00:56:19,925
Michael!

428
00:56:33,064 --> 00:56:35,024
We'll have to be goin' soon.

429
00:56:35,066 --> 00:56:37,234
Dark before we get back.

430
00:56:38,612 --> 00:56:40,154
l’m staying here.

431
00:56:41,823 --> 00:56:42,865
You're what?

432
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:46,285
l’m staying here.

433
00:56:46,327 --> 00:56:49,246
- Here? On the rock?
- Yes.

434
00:56:49,289 --> 00:56:50,998
What the hell for?

435
00:56:53,502 --> 00:56:55,335
- You're mad.
- Yes, perhaps I am.

436
00:56:55,378 --> 00:56:57,588
But l’m still staying,
because somebody has to.

437
00:56:57,631 --> 00:56:59,632
Just because you lot are Australians...

438
00:56:59,675 --> 00:57:00,883
You're a funny bugger.

439
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:07,056
What the hell am I gonna tell 'em
when I get back there without ya?

440
00:57:07,098 --> 00:57:09,099
You can tell 'em what you like.

441
00:57:12,145 --> 00:57:15,565
...What? Woodend?

442
00:57:15,607 --> 00:57:19,359
The Victoria, sir.
The little pub near the corner.

443
00:57:20,946 --> 00:57:24,031
Mr Michael's pretty knocked out, sir.

444
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:26,451
He's sleepin' there.

445
00:57:27,453 --> 00:57:28,494
The pub.

446
00:57:29,746 --> 00:57:31,997
Yeah. Yeah.

447
00:57:32,999 --> 00:57:35,418
l’m dashed if I know
how his aunt'll take it.

448
00:57:38,338 --> 00:57:39,839
Yeah.

449
00:57:48,432 --> 00:57:50,224
All right. Carry on, Crundall.

450
00:57:50,266 --> 00:57:52,059
Thank you, sir.

451
01:00:13,118 --> 01:00:16,787
Stopped at twelve.
Never stopped before.

452
01:00:18,624 --> 01:00:22,793
Everything begins and ends...

453
01:00:24,421 --> 01:00:26,422
...at exactly the right time.

454
01:00:26,465 --> 01:00:29,925
Waiting a million years just for us.

455
01:00:29,968 --> 01:00:33,095
Look! Way up there in the sky!

456
01:00:33,138 --> 01:00:34,930
Now I know!

457
01:00:34,973 --> 01:00:36,974
What do you know?

458
01:00:37,017 --> 01:00:41,687
Surprising the number of
human beings are without purpose...

459
01:00:41,730 --> 01:00:44,607
...although it is probable...

460
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:48,486
...they are performing some function
unknown to themselves.

461
01:00:48,529 --> 01:00:53,282
Everything begins and ends...

462
01:00:53,324 --> 01:00:58,413
...at exactly the right time and place.

463
01:01:07,338 --> 01:01:09,089
Miranda.

464
01:01:19,893 --> 01:01:33,864
Miranda!

465
01:02:05,481 --> 01:02:06,647
Jesus!

466
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:39,847
Coo-ee!

467
01:03:47,749 --> 01:03:49,667
Let me have him now, son.

468
01:03:49,710 --> 01:03:51,877
l’ve had 30 years' experience

469
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:56,424
puttin' them in so they don't fall out
back on the road.

470
01:03:56,467 --> 01:04:00,344
Eh, now lean back.

471
01:04:02,723 --> 01:04:05,891
Take her quietly, Sergeant.

472
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:54,792
Oh, Jesus! Jesus!

473
01:06:07,473 --> 01:06:08,723
Help me!

474
01:06:21,653 --> 01:06:23,488
Help me!

475
01:06:27,576 --> 01:06:29,619
Mademoiselle, they found Irma.

476
01:06:29,661 --> 01:06:30,745
What did you say?

477
01:06:30,787 --> 01:06:33,080
They found Irma, and she's still alive.

478
01:06:39,838 --> 01:06:41,631
No one else?

479
01:06:42,424 --> 01:06:43,841
No.

480
01:07:00,316 --> 01:07:01,316
Now go home.

481
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:04,194
There's nothing you can do.

482
01:07:07,574 --> 01:07:09,450
Go on, now. Go home!

483
01:07:09,493 --> 01:07:11,035
This is a police matter.

484
01:07:16,332 --> 01:07:17,583
Well, go on.

485
01:07:34,726 --> 01:07:38,729
We've got a bloody right to know.
We'd like to know what's going on.

486
01:07:38,772 --> 01:07:40,064
He's right.

487
01:07:41,692 --> 01:07:44,444
We simply want something
done about it.

488
01:07:45,987 --> 01:07:47,530
Where's Bumpher?

489
01:07:50,659 --> 01:07:54,078
What we should do is go to
the bloody rock ourselves.

490
01:07:55,456 --> 01:07:58,373
We've got our own self-respect
to think about.

491
01:07:58,417 --> 01:07:59,792
He's right, there.

492
01:07:59,835 --> 01:08:02,127
Get Bumpher out here.
Come on.

493
01:08:02,170 --> 01:08:03,879
Come out, Bumpher!

494
01:08:06,967 --> 01:08:08,634
Go back.

495
01:08:08,677 --> 01:08:10,636
Go on, go home.

496
01:08:10,679 --> 01:08:12,179
The bloody lot of you.

497
01:08:12,222 --> 01:08:14,348
Nothing you can do.

498
01:08:25,902 --> 01:08:31,198
We can thank the Lord for this merciful
deliverance of our dear classmate, Irma

499
01:08:31,241 --> 01:08:33,743
and pray that Marion and Miranda

500
01:08:33,785 --> 01:08:36,704
and our beloved Miss McCraw
will be likewise spared.

501
01:08:36,747 --> 01:08:38,080
It has been seen fit

502
01:08:38,123 --> 01:08:43,293
that Irma should convalesce at the home
of Colonel Fitzhubert in Mount Macedon.

503
01:08:43,336 --> 01:08:46,464
Although you'll be delighted
at these good tidings,

504
01:08:46,507 --> 01:08:49,174
I would ask you to remember, please,

505
01:08:49,217 --> 01:08:54,179
that of the three remaining lost members
of the party, there is, as yet, no trace.

506
01:08:54,222 --> 01:08:57,224
Would you come with me to my study,
please, Miss Lumley?

507
01:08:57,267 --> 01:08:58,893
You may carry on, Mademoiselle.

508
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:23,042
Wonderful news, Mrs Appleyard.

509
01:09:25,003 --> 01:09:27,463
Don't be so foolish, woman!

510
01:09:27,506 --> 01:09:29,924
If all of them had been found
but only one?

511
01:09:29,966 --> 01:09:33,385
This makes it worse.
Far worse.

512
01:09:33,429 --> 01:09:36,472
This tragedy is little more
than a week old

513
01:09:36,515 --> 01:09:40,142
and already three - three, mark you -
sets of parents have written

514
01:09:40,185 --> 01:09:43,938
advising me that their daughters
will not be here next term.

515
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:48,317
Now the newspapers have something
further to sensationalise about.

516
01:09:48,359 --> 01:09:51,446
Newspapers all over the world have
headlined our morbid affair, Miss Lumley.

517
01:09:51,488 --> 01:09:53,656
I mean, you realise that, I suppose.

518
01:09:55,033 --> 01:09:59,745
The three who have been withdrawn, plus
the three still missing on the rock...

519
01:09:59,788 --> 01:10:03,791
Two, Mrs Appleyard, only two now.
l’m quite sure Irma will be coming back.

520
01:10:03,834 --> 01:10:08,170
That makes six, Miss Lumley...
will not be with us next term.

521
01:10:10,090 --> 01:10:14,343
In addition, there are several sets of
tuition fees impossibly overdue.

522
01:10:15,887 --> 01:10:18,222
Sara Waybourne, for instance.

523
01:10:20,684 --> 01:10:23,393
Most inconsiderate, if I may say so,
Mrs Appleyard.

524
01:10:25,063 --> 01:10:26,313
Yes.

525
01:10:28,108 --> 01:10:29,191
Well, I...

526
01:10:30,444 --> 01:10:33,112
I expect we shall see
our way through somehow.

527
01:10:34,114 --> 01:10:37,825
Don't let me detain you, Miss Lumley, you
have a class in a few minutes, I believe.

528
01:10:37,868 --> 01:10:38,868
Senior needlework.

529
01:10:40,328 --> 01:10:43,539
Just ask the Waybourne girl
to come in to see me, please.

530
01:10:43,582 --> 01:10:46,834
After luncheon will be convenient.

531
01:10:46,877 --> 01:10:48,210
Yes, Mrs Appleyard.

532
01:10:49,796 --> 01:10:50,963
Oh, and Miss Lumley.

533
01:10:52,007 --> 01:10:54,842
Do your best to forbid any
idle and morbid gossip

534
01:10:54,885 --> 01:10:58,846
- about this whole wretched business.
- Yes, Mrs Appleyard. I will.

535
01:12:06,873 --> 01:12:10,710
Remarkable. Hmm.

536
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:17,925
A week out in the bush and nothing more
serious than shock and exposure.

537
01:12:19,678 --> 01:12:21,512
Extraordinary!

538
01:12:22,764 --> 01:12:24,306
No bones broken.

539
01:12:25,308 --> 01:12:29,520
Some cuts and bruises
to the face and hands.

540
01:12:31,732 --> 01:12:34,024
To the hands especially.

541
01:12:38,947 --> 01:12:40,781
Quite scratched.

542
01:12:42,659 --> 01:12:46,036
The fingernails are all torn and broken.

543
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:50,040
There are several other
unusual features.

544
01:12:51,042 --> 01:12:53,919
Her head is quite badly bruised.

545
01:12:54,921 --> 01:12:57,507
Probable concussion.

546
01:12:58,299 --> 01:13:00,175
A blow, maybe?

547
01:13:01,386 --> 01:13:02,803
Or a fall?

548
01:13:04,806 --> 01:13:06,932
But then if she fell...

549
01:13:08,101 --> 01:13:10,936
...why is the rest of the body unmarked?

550
01:13:12,606 --> 01:13:14,440
It’s quite unblemished.

551
01:13:16,192 --> 01:13:21,697
And the feet, too, are quite unmarked,
which is very strange

552
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:25,910
as she was not wearing shoes or stockings
when she was found.

553
01:13:25,952 --> 01:13:28,496
We found no trace of 'em up on the rock.

554
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:35,545
She's quite intact.

555
01:13:37,213 --> 01:13:41,175
l’d give my head to know what really
happened up there.

556
01:13:45,055 --> 01:13:46,764
She's quite intact.

557
01:13:51,770 --> 01:13:53,145
What is it, my girl?

558
01:13:54,064 --> 01:13:56,482
Well, ma'am, it's Miss Irma.

559
01:13:56,525 --> 01:13:57,567
Yes?

560
01:13:58,569 --> 01:14:01,320
Well, it's about her clothing.

561
01:14:01,362 --> 01:14:03,489
What is it, my dear?

562
01:14:03,532 --> 01:14:07,367
Well, I didn't know whether
the sergeant should be told.

563
01:14:07,411 --> 01:14:10,871
There's... there's no corset.

564
01:14:10,914 --> 01:14:15,125
Miss Irma's corset. It’s missing.

565
01:14:15,168 --> 01:14:20,465
You did right, my dear.
It can't possibly be of any interest.

♪ The north wind brings me no rest. ♪

567
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:31,308

for instance.

569
01:14:46,408 --> 01:14:49,034
The police are up there again, naturally.

570
01:14:49,077 --> 01:14:50,828
Thick as flies.

571
01:14:53,331 --> 01:14:56,626
Someone reported seein' a light
flashing around a pigsty

on a place about a mile from the rock.

573
01:14:59,045 --> 01:15:03,048
There's some questions got answers
and some haven't.

574
01:15:08,179 --> 01:15:12,433
No. There'll be a solution
turn up directly, more'n likely.

575
01:15:16,647 --> 01:15:18,188
A kidnappin'.

576

Or, you know, something like that.

577
01:15:26,657 --> 01:15:28,949
They might have fallen down a hole.

578
01:15:33,789 --> 01:15:37,917
No, no. There's a solution
somewhere, all right.

579
01:15:39,044 --> 01:15:40,545
There's gotta be.

580
01:15:41,547 --> 01:15:42,922
Come over here.

581
01:15:42,964 --> 01:15:45,049
Come on. Over here.

582
01:15:49,888 --> 01:15:53,808
Did you know, lad, there are some plants
that can move?

583
01:15:55,644 --> 01:15:57,186
No.

584
01:16:22,003 --> 01:16:25,047
Miss Lumley said you wanted to see me,
Mrs Appleyard.

585
01:16:25,090 --> 01:16:26,882
That is correct.

586
01:16:26,925 --> 01:16:28,801
Come in.

587
01:16:30,512 --> 01:16:32,722
Close the door, please.

588
01:16:44,818 --> 01:16:49,405
I have written several letters to your
guardian, Mr Cosgrove, Sara,

589
01:16:49,448 --> 01:16:53,033
but I have not been favoured
with a reply thus far.

590
01:16:54,578 --> 01:16:58,956
In fact, it is all of six months since
I have received a letter...

591
01:17:00,083 --> 01:17:01,709
...or a cheque.

592
01:17:02,794 --> 01:17:07,089
I, therefore, have no alternative
but to cancel all your extras.

593
01:17:08,091 --> 01:17:09,967
This means that, as of today,

594
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:14,096
you can no longer partake in
dancing or drawing lessons.

595
01:17:14,931 --> 01:17:18,851
And unless all your outstanding fees
are paid by Easter,

596
01:17:18,894 --> 01:17:23,147
l’m afraid we shall have to make
other arrangements.

597
01:17:24,941 --> 01:17:28,235
You know what that means,
don't you, Sara?

598
01:17:30,656 --> 01:17:32,782
You will have to go away.

599
01:17:34,660 --> 01:17:37,703
There are places for girls
in your predicament.

600
01:17:37,746 --> 01:17:39,747
Institutions.

601
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,839
Now off you go.

602
01:17:50,592 --> 01:17:52,342
Sara.

603
01:18:16,410 --> 01:18:19,537
Sara! What's wrong with you?

604
01:18:21,832 --> 01:18:23,499
Are you feeling ill?

605
01:18:26,377 --> 01:18:30,506
People don't sit on cold steps in the dark
unless they're weak in the head.

606
01:18:34,302 --> 01:18:37,012
You heard the bell.
Go and wash for supper.

607
01:18:43,604 --> 01:18:45,480
Aren't you hungry?

608
01:18:48,734 --> 01:18:50,943
Then you'd best go straight to bed.

609
01:18:58,785 --> 01:18:59,952
Quickly.

610
01:19:07,461 --> 01:19:10,713
Tell Mam'selle I don't want it.
Thank you.

611
01:19:10,756 --> 01:19:14,884
But you must eat.
You'll get sick if you don't.

612
01:19:14,926 --> 01:19:19,639
l’m sick already.
If I eat that, I'll be even sicker.

613
01:19:19,681 --> 01:19:22,600
Nonsense. Now come on, Miss Sara.

614
01:19:22,643 --> 01:19:24,309
Do you know what, Minnie?

615
01:19:25,311 --> 01:19:26,729
No. What?

616
01:19:27,731 --> 01:19:29,774
I was in an orphanage once.

617
01:19:29,816 --> 01:19:31,942
Were you, Sara?

618
01:19:37,365 --> 01:19:39,116
I had a brother then...

619
01:19:40,326 --> 01:19:42,453
...called Bertie.

620
01:19:50,295 --> 01:19:55,425
I told the matron I wanted to be
a lady circus rider

621
01:19:55,467 --> 01:19:58,553
on a white horse in a spangled dress.

622
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:06,727
She was afraid l’d run away,
so she shaved my head.

623
01:20:08,522 --> 01:20:11,941
I bit her arm. It bled.

624
01:20:14,528 --> 01:20:17,738
So she painted my head
with gentian violet.

Yeah, them too.

01:21:35,817 --> 01:21:37,359
You know.

Now I know.

641
01:22:10,185 --> 01:22:14,313
What do you know?

642
01:22:16,399 --> 01:22:20,736
I know that Miranda is a Botticelli angel.

643
01:22:52,185 --> 01:22:54,645
Hold it right there, thanks, gentlemen.

01:22:54,688 --> 01:22:56,063

01:23:12,831 --> 01:23:15,290
Now they crossed the creek
down there?

649
01:23:15,333 --> 01:23:18,377
The rope.
Not that stuff. The other.

650
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:20,796
Give me that rope
over here.

01:23:20,839 --> 01:23:23,674
What about
a cup of tea up here?

652
01:23:23,717 --> 01:23:25,175
Ah, tea.

01:23:39,107 --> 01:23:41,358
Good, good.

655
01:23:42,861 --> 01:23:44,612
As if looking up. Right up.

656
01:23:44,655 --> 01:23:47,782
That's it. Looking for a cave
or something like that.

657
01:23:47,824 --> 01:23:50,284
Little more expression in the face, sir.

658

Hello, Irma.

659
01:24:04,382 --> 01:24:06,801
Madame Fitzhubert showed me in.

660
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:13,265
How do you feel?

661
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:21,441
Oh, Irma! Oh, Irma.

662
01:24:23,902 --> 01:24:26,487
We thought you had gone for ever.

663
01:24:32,453 --> 01:24:34,995
Let me look at you, chérie.

664
01:24:37,999 --> 01:24:39,959
You are so pale

665
01:24:41,211 --> 01:24:43,337
but prettier than ever.

666
01:24:47,968 --> 01:24:50,219
Has the nephew paid you a visit yet?

667
01:24:51,221 --> 01:24:53,013
The one who found you?

668
01:24:54,015 --> 01:24:55,307
Yes.

669
01:24:57,102 --> 01:24:59,311
And then the policeman.

670
01:25:01,982 --> 01:25:04,316
And you couldn't...

671

Nothing! I remember nothing!

674
01:27:54,237 --> 01:27:56,406

675
01:27:58,784 --> 01:28:00,701

676
01:28:00,744 --> 01:28:02,745
Girls, girls, get inside at once!

677
01:28:05,373 --> 01:28:07,875
There you are,
Miranda dear.

678
01:28:07,918 --> 01:28:09,960
You like these best.

679
01:28:11,379 --> 01:28:14,424
Mr Whitehead gave them to me,
to give to you.

680
01:28:14,466 --> 01:28:16,133
My dear...

681
01:28:16,176 --> 01:28:18,761
...my sweet Miranda.

682
01:28:29,523 --> 01:28:32,399
She likes daisies best of all.

683
01:28:33,569 --> 01:28:36,571
Oh, Sara! Oh, Sara!

684
01:28:38,198 --> 01:28:41,867
You do know that Miranda
might not come back.

685
01:28:49,501 --> 01:28:53,087
Miranda knows lots of things
other people don't know.

686
01:28:55,131 --> 01:28:57,382
Secrets.

687
01:29:04,725 --> 01:29:06,892
She knew she wouldn't come back.

688
01:29:16,570 --> 01:29:21,699
Fanny, you are ridiculously out of step.
Pay attention to the music, please!

689
01:29:43,889 --> 01:29:45,347
Excuse me, Miss Lumley.

690
01:29:46,558 --> 01:29:49,602
Voilà, mes enfants!
See who we have with us today?

691
01:29:49,645 --> 01:29:53,773
Our dear Irma is with us
but for a few hours.

692
01:29:53,815 --> 01:29:58,736
She is leaving soon
to join her parents in Europe.

693
01:30:01,948 --> 01:30:05,993
Alors, mes enfants. For ten minutes,
you may talk as you choose.

694
01:30:06,036 --> 01:30:08,621
If you approve, Miss Lumley.

695
01:30:35,607 --> 01:30:39,234
- Tell us, Irma! Tell us!
- Yes, Irma, tell us!

696
01:30:39,277 --> 01:30:42,488
- Tell us, Irma! Tell us!
- What happened to Miranda, Irma?

697
01:30:42,531 --> 01:30:45,825
- You know what happened. Tell us!
- Tell us, Irma!

698
01:30:47,786 --> 01:30:49,787
Tell us, Irma!

699
01:30:49,830 --> 01:30:52,790
- Why won't you tell us, Irma?
- You know where they are.

700
01:30:52,833 --> 01:30:56,711
Just tell us, Irma, tell us.

701
01:30:56,753 --> 01:31:01,298
They're dead! All dead and gone, Irma!

702
01:31:02,300 --> 01:31:04,885
She's going to you know where!

703
01:31:06,012 --> 01:31:07,972
You are a liar and a fool!

704
01:31:35,250 --> 01:31:38,711
Mam'selle?

705
01:31:38,754 --> 01:31:40,838
It’s for her own good!

706
01:31:40,881 --> 01:31:43,007
To cure her terrible stooping!

707
01:32:02,152 --> 01:32:03,986
Come in.

708
01:32:12,203 --> 01:32:14,789
Well? Come in.

709
01:32:27,594 --> 01:32:29,470
My notice, ma'am.

710
01:33:18,228 --> 01:33:20,896
Have we an invalid in the house?

711
01:33:20,939 --> 01:33:23,273
Miss Sara's supper, ma'am.

712
01:33:23,316 --> 01:33:26,944
Mademoiselle asked me,
seeing as the child's feeling poorly.

713
01:33:28,655 --> 01:33:30,072
Minnie.

714
01:33:31,492 --> 01:33:36,161
Kindly tell Miss Sara not to put her light
out until l’ve had a word with her.

715
01:33:36,204 --> 01:33:37,497
Yes, ma'am.

716
01:33:47,007 --> 01:33:50,635
This is not
a charitable institution.

717
01:34:05,025 --> 01:34:08,235
You recall our recent discussion, Sara.

718
01:34:11,239 --> 01:34:12,990
Answer me when I address you, child.

719
01:34:14,535 --> 01:34:15,660
Yes.

720
01:34:16,703 --> 01:34:20,415
I have considered your situation
most carefully,

721
01:34:20,457 --> 01:34:25,044
and I have searched my mind and
my conscience for a solution.

722
01:34:26,129 --> 01:34:29,590
But this is not a charitable institution.

723
01:34:30,717 --> 01:34:34,219
And as your fees have not been
forthcoming, I have...

724
01:34:34,262 --> 01:34:38,849
...been forced to make certain
arrangements on your behalf.

725
01:34:40,101 --> 01:34:43,395
You will be returned to the orphanage.

726
01:35:22,603 --> 01:35:25,229
God, help me!

727
01:36:20,243 --> 01:36:22,537
You still thinking about that bloody rock?

728
01:36:22,579 --> 01:36:24,371
I can't help it.

729
01:36:24,415 --> 01:36:27,082
It comes back at night in dreams.

730
01:36:28,919 --> 01:36:31,378
I had a funny dream last night.

731
01:36:32,380 --> 01:36:35,340
There was this smell. Real strong.

732
01:36:36,843 --> 01:36:39,637
It was like... like I was wide awake.

733
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:40,680
Dead quiet.

734
01:36:42,140 --> 01:36:44,517
Pansies. That's what it smelt like.

735
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:48,103
And the whole place was all lit up,
bright as day.

736
01:36:51,316 --> 01:36:53,025
Pitch black outside.

737
01:36:54,570 --> 01:36:56,070
And there she is.

738
01:36:56,112 --> 01:36:57,237
Who?

739
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:59,490
Who was it?

740
01:36:59,533 --> 01:37:01,492
It was only a bloody dream!

741
01:37:03,912 --> 01:37:05,496
My kid sister.

742
01:37:06,498 --> 01:37:08,708
Haven't seen her since the orphanage.

743
01:37:08,750 --> 01:37:10,751
She always liked pansies.

744
01:37:13,296 --> 01:37:16,131
And she went... all sort of...

745
01:37:16,174 --> 01:37:18,092
...misty-like.

746
01:37:20,637 --> 01:37:22,054
I calls out,

747
01:37:22,097 --> 01:37:25,182
'Sara, don't go yet. '

748
01:37:27,519 --> 01:37:29,645
'Goodbye, Bertie,' she says.

749
01:37:29,688 --> 01:37:34,066
'l’ve come a long way to see ya,
and now I must go. '

750
01:37:35,652 --> 01:37:37,319
And she went.

751
01:37:38,739 --> 01:37:40,698
Clear through that wall over there.

752
01:37:51,001 --> 01:37:54,462
- Sit down, please, Mademoiselle.
- Merci.

753
01:37:54,505 --> 01:37:58,382
We were speaking last night
about the Waybourne girl.

754
01:37:58,425 --> 01:38:02,136
You expressed concern over
the state of her health.

755
01:38:02,178 --> 01:38:03,429
Yes, Madame.

756
01:38:03,472 --> 01:38:07,099
We have been relieved of
any further responsibility.

757
01:38:07,142 --> 01:38:12,772
Her guardian, Mr Cosgrove, arrived
this morning and took her away with him.

758
01:38:16,860 --> 01:38:18,444
But...

759
01:38:18,487 --> 01:38:20,613
But was she fit enough to travel?

760
01:38:21,657 --> 01:38:23,991
Apparently.

761
01:38:24,034 --> 01:38:27,077
I should have been here
to supervise her packing.

762
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:30,205
I, myself, helped Sara put a few things
she especially wanted

763
01:38:30,248 --> 01:38:31,916
into her little covered basket.

764
01:38:31,958 --> 01:38:34,084
Mr Cosgrove was in a hurry to get away.

765
01:38:34,127 --> 01:38:36,921
I shall not be coming
into luncheon, Mademoiselle.

766
01:38:36,963 --> 01:38:39,089
Kindly tell them not to lay
a place for me.

767
01:38:39,132 --> 01:38:40,299
Nor for Sara?

768
01:38:42,010 --> 01:38:43,010
Nor for Sara.

769
01:38:48,391 --> 01:38:51,811
Is that rouge I see on your cheek,
Mademoiselle?

770
01:38:52,813 --> 01:38:56,065
Powder, Madame. I find it becoming.

771
01:39:01,780 --> 01:39:03,739
Oh, God!

772
01:39:20,090 --> 01:39:23,217
Thank you very much for
the lovely breakfast!

773
01:39:23,259 --> 01:39:26,887
Bye-bye! Au revoir! Bye-bye!

774
01:39:26,930 --> 01:39:31,642
Hope you have a nice holiday!
Bye-bye! Bye-bye! Au revoir!

775
01:39:37,148 --> 01:39:39,567
Au revoir, mes enfants.

776
01:39:39,610 --> 01:39:44,321
♪ Frère Jacques, Frère Jacques
Dormez vous? Dormez vous?... ♪

777
01:39:44,364 --> 01:39:46,115
Au revoir!

778
01:40:23,361 --> 01:40:27,156
Arthur, my late husband, and I,

779
01:40:27,198 --> 01:40:30,826
always took our annual holidays
in Bournemouth.

780
01:40:31,912 --> 01:40:36,791
Mmm. It’s a delightful place.
Absolutely delightful.

781
01:40:37,793 --> 01:40:39,960
Nothing changed. Ever.

782
01:40:40,003 --> 01:40:42,212
For 40 years.

783
01:40:43,214 --> 01:40:46,717
The pier, the sands and the people.

784
01:40:47,803 --> 01:40:51,764
And that guest house. So dependable.

785
01:40:52,974 --> 01:40:56,977
Completely and utterly dependable.

786
01:41:01,775 --> 01:41:04,318
A little more, Mam'selle?

787
01:41:04,360 --> 01:41:05,695
No, Madame.

788
01:41:05,737 --> 01:41:08,072
As you wish.

789
01:41:17,916 --> 01:41:21,836
I came to depend so much
on Greta McCraw.

790
01:41:21,878 --> 01:41:24,922
So much masculine intellect.

791
01:41:24,965 --> 01:41:29,927
I came to rely on that woman. Trust her.

792
01:41:29,970 --> 01:41:33,764
How could she allow herself
to be spirited away?

793
01:41:33,807 --> 01:41:35,975
Lost.

794
01:41:37,603 --> 01:41:38,769
Raped.

795
01:41:38,812 --> 01:41:43,483
Murdered in cold blood
like a silly schoolgirl on that...

796
01:41:43,525 --> 01:41:46,652
...wretched Hanging Rock.

797
01:41:54,745 --> 01:41:58,372
Will Sara Waybourne be coming back
this term, Madame?

798
01:41:59,416 --> 01:42:03,043
.... Now where was I?

799
01:42:04,505 --> 01:42:08,758
Oh, yes! Bournemouth.

800
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:11,594
What a delightful place!

801
01:42:12,929 --> 01:42:16,432
Nothing changed. Ever.

802
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:21,395
Dirty kids.

803
01:43:14,950 --> 01:43:19,787
Sara!

804
01:43:35,804 --> 01:43:40,265
The body of Mrs Arthur Appleyard,
principal of Appleyard College,

805
01:43:40,308 --> 01:43:45,145
was found at the base of Hanging Rock
on Friday 27th March, 1900.

806
01:43:45,188 --> 01:43:49,233
Although the exact circumstances
of her death are not known,

807
01:43:49,275 --> 01:43:53,195
it is believed she fell while
attempting to climb the rock.

808
01:43:53,238 --> 01:43:56,907
A search for the missing schoolgirls
and their governess

809
01:43:56,950 --> 01:44:01,746
continued spasmodically for
the next few years without success.

810
01:44:01,788 --> 01:44:06,459
To this day, their disappearance
remains a mystery.
