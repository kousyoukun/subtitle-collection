363

crossing the creek.

Oh, oh, yes.

399
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:45,582
That's because the...dumpy one
was back a little.

400
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:50,499
Then they...er...moved off
into the trees

401
00:43:50,541 --> 00:43:52,790

Arthur, my late husband, and l,

891
01:40:01,291 --> 01:40:04,915
always took our annual holidays
in Bournemouth.

892
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:10,874
Mmm. It’s a delightful place.
Absolutely delightful.

893
01:40:11,875 --> 01:40:14,040
Nothing changed. Ever.

894
01:40:14,083 --> 01:40:16,290
For 40 years.

895
01:40:17,291 --> 01:40:20,790
The pier, the sands and the people.

896
01:40:21,875 --> 01:40:25,832
And that guest house. So dependable.

897
01:40:27,041 --> 01:40:31,040
Completely and utterly dependable.

898
01:40:35,833 --> 01:40:38,374
A little more, Mam'selle?

899
01:40:38,416 --> 01:40:39,749
No, Madame.

900
01:40:39,791 --> 01:40:42,124
As you wish.

902
01:40:51,958 --> 01:40:55,874
I came to depend so much
on Greta McCraw.

903
01:40:55,916 --> 01:40:58,957
So much masculine intellect.

904
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:03,957
I came to rely on that woman. Trust her.

905
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,790
How could she allow herself
to be spirited away?

906
01:41:07,833 --> 01:41:09,999
Lost.

907
01:41:11,625 --> 01:41:12,790
Raped.

908
01:41:12,833 --> 01:41:17,499
Murdered in cold blood
like a silly schoolgirl on that...

Will Sara Waybourne be coming back
this term, Madame?

911
01:41:33,416 --> 01:41:37,040
Oh! Now where was l?

912
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:42,749
Oh, yes! Bournemouth.

913
01:41:42,791 --> 01:41:45,582
What a delightful place!

914
01:41:46,916 --> 01:41:50,415
Nothing changed. Ever.

915
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:55,374

The body of Mrs Arthur Appleyard,
principal of Appleyard College,

923
01:43:14,208 --> 01:43:19,040
was found at the base of Hanging Rock
on Friday 27th March, 1900.

924
01:43:19,083 --> 01:43:23,124
Although the exact circumstances
of her death are not known,

925
01:43:23,166 --> 01:43:27,082
it is believed she fell while
attempting to climb the rock.

A search for the missing schoolgirls
and their governess

927
01:43:30,833 --> 01:43:35,624
continued spasmodically for
the next few years without success.

928
01:43:35,666 --> 01:43:40,332
To this day, their disappearance
remains a mystery.
