ln June 1 807, in Tilsit,

36
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:23,870
Emperor Alexander met with Napoleon.

37
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:37,634
Meanwhile, life -

38
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,594
real life as lived by people

39
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:44,099
with its essential interests
of health and sickness,

40
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:46,434
toil and rest,

41
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:51,606
and its intellectual interests
in science, poetry, music,

42
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:56,277
with its love, passions,
friendship and hatred -

43
00:03:56,362 --> 00:03:58,196
went on as usual

44
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:04,953
regardless of whether political relations
with Bonaparte were hostile or not.

45
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:09,791
January, February, March, ApriI.

46
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,961
Speak to me, Mother.
Why are you siIent?

47
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:17,382
This won't do, my dear.

48
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:22,011
Not everyone wiII understand
your oId chiIdhood friendship.

49
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:27,809
Seeing him with you may harm you
in the eyes of other young men.

50
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:30,019
What's more,
it's tormenting him for no reason.

51
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:34,816
He might have found a weaIthy match,
and now he's going mad.

52
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,401
Is he?

53
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,028
I'II teII you about myseIf.

54
00:04:39,864 --> 00:04:41,781
I had a certain cousin.

55
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:47,245
I know. KiriII Matveyevich.
But he's oId!

56
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:51,166
He was not aIways oId.

57
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,461
I'II teII Boris
that he is not to come so often.

58
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:57,130
Why not if he feeIs Iike it?

59
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,090
I know this wiII come to nothing.

60
00:04:59,175 --> 00:05:02,469
Nonsense! What does it matter?

61
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:05,597
So I won't marry him. Let him come.

62
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:10,935
We both enjoy ourseIves.
It's not about marriage, but just, weII -

63
00:05:11,604 --> 00:05:13,938
-What are you saying?
-WeII, just -

64
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:18,151
Just what I mean.
I don't have to marry him.

65
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,820
Just -
-"Just."

66
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,910
Stop Iaughing.
You're shaking the bed.

67
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:30,788
You're awfuIIy Iike me,
just such another giggIer!

68
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,464
Mother.

69
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:44,969
Do you think he's very much in Iove?

70
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:48,264
Was anybody
ever in Iove with you Iike that?

71
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:51,726
And he's very nice. Very nice.

72
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,853
But he's not quite to my taste.

73
00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:00,401
He's so narrow,
Iike the dining-room cIock.

74
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:02,403
Know what I mean?
-No.

75
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:05,990
Narrow, gray, shining.

76
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:07,408
What nonsense.

77
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:10,828
Don't you see it? NikoIai wouId.

78
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:18,586
Now, Bezukhov, he is dark bIue and red.

79
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:20,004
And squarish.

80
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:21,214
You flirt with him too.

81
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:23,925
No, he's a Freemason.

82
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:28,179
But he's nice too - dark bIue and red.
Can't you see?

83
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,683
Countess, aren't you asIeep?

84
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:49,200
No one can understand
all that goes on within me.

85
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:53,454
Sonya? Not her. She is too virtuous.

86
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:56,374
Even Mother cannot understand.

87
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:01,129
lt is amazing how clever l am and how -

88
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:02,714
How charming she is.

89
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:07,719
She has everything - intelligence, grace.

90
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:10,388
She swims and rides well.

91
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:13,600
And her voice! A truly lovely voice.

92
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:53,848
On the 31st of December 1 809,
on New Year's Eve,

93
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:57,435
one of Catherine's courtiers
was giving a ball.

94
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:03,358
Diplomats and the emperor himself
were to be present.

95
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,361
The Rostovs were invited,

96
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:11,491
and Natasha was going
to her first grand ball.

97
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:12,742
Not Iike that.

98
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,787
That bow is not right, Sonya.
Come here!

99
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,373
Are you ready? It's 1 0:00.

100
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:21,584
In a minute.
Are you ready, Mother?

101
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:23,961
I've onIy my toque to pin on.

102
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:26,673
Don't do it without me.
You'II do it wrong.

103
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:28,466
It's 1 0:00 aIready.

104
00:08:44,817 --> 00:08:47,151
Hurry up, Mavrusha dear!

105
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:54,951
-Are we going or not?
-We are. Don't come in!

106
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,961
ls it possible that no one
will come up to me?

107
00:13:58,005 --> 00:14:00,256
ls it possible that no one will notice me?

108
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:48,823
No, it can't be.

109
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:51,659
They must know how l long to dance,

110
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:53,494
how splendidly l can dance

111
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,913
and how they'll enjoy dancing with me.

112
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:26,944
I find it interesting.
It's probabIy Speransky.

113
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,572
You aIways dance.

114
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:32,616
My protegee is here - the young Rostova.

115
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:35,327
Invite her to dance.
-Of course.

116
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:38,956
Pardon me. We wiII finish
this conversation eIsewhere.

117
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,875
At a baII, one shouId dance.

118
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:07,735
AIIow me to introduce my daughter.

119
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:11,989
I have the pIeasure of being acquainted
with her, if she recaIIs me.

120
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:14,325
WouId you honor me with a waItz?

121
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:41,615
lf she goes to her cousin first
and then to another lady,

122
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:43,617
then she will be my wife.

123
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:49,415
How deIightfuI, isn't it?

124
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:54,378
Yes, I am very pIeased.

125
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:28,745
It's you. I've been working.

126
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,790
I wanted to teII you yesterday.

127
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,042
I've never feIt anything Iike this.

128
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:37,671
I have faIIen in Iove, my friend.

129
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:41,258
Mother, don't ask me anything.
Just Iet me taIk.

130
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:44,344
-Is it Natasha Rostova?
-Yes! Who eIse?

131
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:47,014
This feeIing is overpowering.

132
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:51,643
I didn't feeI I was aIive before.
OnIy now am I aIive. I can't Iive without her.

133
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:54,271
But can she Iove me?
I'm too oId for her.

134
00:21:54,355 --> 00:22:00,360
I never feIt Iike this.
OnIy it scares me to be around him.

135
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:03,363
What does it mean?
Does it mean it is true Iove?

136
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:06,158
-Why don't you say something?
-WeII...

137
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,368
I toId you Iife was not over.

138
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:11,538
-Are you asIeep, Mother?
-No, I am afraid too. Go now.

139
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:17,169
I know I won't sIeep anyway.
Mother, I never feIt Iike this before!

140
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:20,339
She is a rare girI,

141
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:23,300
a girI to be treasured.

142
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:25,719
Don't waver or try to be rationaI.

143
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:30,682
Marry her.
I'm sure there wiII be no happier man.

144
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,476
-But what about her?
-She Ioves you.

145
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,478
-Nonsense.
-I know she does.

146
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:37,981
I feeI I must teII somebody aII about it.

147
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:40,108
Go on, teII me.

148
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:43,904
How odd that he shouId have come
to St. Petersburg just now

149
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:46,365
and that we shouId have met at that baII.

150
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:50,452
It is fate. Everything Ied up to it.
I've never feIt this before.

151
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:53,288
The whoIe worId is now divided in two.

152
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:58,377
She is one haIf of it.
Where she is, there is hope and Iight.

153
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:01,171
The other haIf is wherever she is not.
Darkness and gIoom is there.

154
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:03,549
Darkness, gIoom. I understand that.

155
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:06,134
I cannot heIp Ioving the Iight.

156
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:09,930
And I am very happy.
I know you are happy for me.

157
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:10,681
Yes, yes.

158
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:14,101
Mother darIing, I am so happy.
I Iove you so much!

159
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,159
Three weeks passed.

160
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:34,705
Bolkonsky didn't call on the Rostovs
even once.

161
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:25,589
DarIing Natasha.

162
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:28,800
Perhaps he is iII.

163
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:31,053
He was wounded at AusterIitz, remember?

164
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:33,347
Or he's busy.

165
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:37,059
PIease, Mother,
I don't want to think about it.

166
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:42,439
He used to come and now he doesn't.
He's stopped.

167
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:48,153
I don't want to get married at aII.
I'm afraid of him.

168
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,530
I'm compIeteIy -

169
00:24:50,615 --> 00:24:52,115
I'm compIeteIy caIm.

170
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:21,520
What's the good of thinking about it?
l'm not unhappy.

171
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:39,496
There, that's me. And very nice too.

172
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,373
l don't need anybody.

173
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,960
How charming Natasha is.

174
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:48,839
She's pretty, young, has a good voice
and never gets in people's way.

175
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:50,590
lf only they'd leave her in peace.

176
00:25:58,516 --> 00:26:01,351
Mother, BoIkonsky has come!

177
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:14,573
It's awfuI, unbearabIe!

178
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:17,325
I won't be tormented so!
What shaII I do?

179
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:19,161
Who's come? When?

180
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:22,247
Enough, Natasha.

181
00:26:57,742 --> 00:26:59,868
It's been a Iong time
since we've had the pIeasure.

182
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:03,371
I haven't visited
because I've been at my father's.

183
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:06,625
I had to taIk over
a very important matter with him.

184
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:08,335
I came back Iast night.

185
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:16,760
I need to taIk to you, Countess.

186
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:23,934
Leave us, Natasha. I'II caII you.

187
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:08,728
Lord, have mercy.

188
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:11,481
HeIp me, O Lord. HeIp me.

189
00:28:19,991 --> 00:28:21,366
What is it, Mother?

190
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:26,621
Go to him.

191
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:29,541
He asks for your hand.

192
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:06,036
Could it be that this stranger
now means everything to me,

193
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:11,750
that he is dearer to me
than anyone in the world?

194
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:26,222
I took to you from the moment I saw you.

195
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:28,934
May I hope?

196
00:29:29,894 --> 00:29:32,020
Why ask?

197
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,397
Why doubt what you cannot but know?

198
00:29:34,482 --> 00:29:38,026
Why speak when words cannot
express what one feels?

199
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,111
Do you Iove me?

200
00:29:40,196 --> 00:29:41,571
Yes! Yes!

201
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:59,255
What is it? What's wrong?

202
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:02,425
I am so happy.

203
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:07,806
Prince Andrei did not love her now
as before.

204
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:11,601
Something in him suddenly changed.

205
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:15,397
There was no longer
the poetic charm of longing,

206
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:18,692
but pity for her feminine
and childish weakness

207
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:21,987
and fear of her trust and devotion.

208
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:26,866
The present feeling,
though not so romantic,

209
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:29,786
was stronger and deeper.

210
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:33,623
Did your mother teII you
that we cannot be married for a year?

211
00:30:33,708 --> 00:30:35,542
ls it possible that this is me,

212
00:30:36,961 --> 00:30:41,089
that l am to be the wife,

213
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:45,093
the equal of this strange,
charming, intelligent man

214
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:47,387
whom even my father looks up to?

215
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:51,766
ls it true
that l can no longer be frivolous?

216
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,352
l'm grown up now.

217
00:30:55,104 --> 00:30:58,690
l must answer for my every deed and word.

218
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:02,110
What was it he asked me?

219
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:04,237
No.

220
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:08,783
You are young,
and I have been through so much aIready.

221
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:12,328
I fear for you.
You don't know yourseIf yet.

222
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:18,835
This wiII be a hard year for me,
postponing my happiness,

223
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:20,879
but you wiII Iearn to know yourseIf.

224
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:26,676
And I ask you, in a year,
to make me happy.

225
00:31:26,761 --> 00:31:29,888
But you are free.
We won't announce our engagement.

226
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:32,766
If you find you don't Iove me -

227
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,893
Why shouId you say such a thing?

228
00:31:34,977 --> 00:31:39,564
I have Ioved you
since the day you came to Otradnoye.

229
00:31:45,196 --> 00:31:47,530
You wiII Iearn to know yourseIf
within the year.

230
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,330
A whoIe year?

231
00:31:57,583 --> 00:32:00,210
But why a year? Why a year?

232
00:32:01,045 --> 00:32:02,712
Can't anything be done?

233
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:09,094
It's crueI. It's crueI!

234
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:12,055
I shaII die waiting for the year to end.

235
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:14,015
It's horribIe.

236
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:16,893
It's horribIe!

237
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:23,817
No. I'II do everything.

238
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:27,278
I am so happy.

239
00:32:33,744 --> 00:32:36,538
There was no formal betrothal,

240
00:32:36,622 --> 00:32:41,793
and the engagement
was not announced to anyone.

241
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:56,474
Don't go.

242
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,519
Please, Natalie, l must go.

243
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:03,273
God knows what may happen.
You may stop loving -

244
00:33:03,357 --> 00:33:06,234
l know l mustn't say that.

245
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:09,070
Whatever may happen while l am away -

246
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:10,864
Please don't go.

247
00:33:10,948 --> 00:33:12,991
Whatever happens,

248
00:33:13,075 --> 00:33:17,954
turn to Pierre for help and advice.

249
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:22,500
He is absent-minded and comical,
but he has a heart of gold.

250
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:31,092
Don't go.

251
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:48,568
How horrible Pierre would have felt
seven years earlier

252
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:51,696
when he came home from abroad

253
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,240
if someone had told him

254
00:33:54,325 --> 00:33:59,037
that there was no need for him
to seek and plan,

255
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:04,000
that his life's course
had been predetermined.

256
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:08,087
He would tell himself
that the kind of life he was leading

257
00:34:08,172 --> 00:34:10,173
was only temporary.

258
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:16,596
But then he was shocked by the thought

259
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:23,770
of how many had begun that life,
like himself, with all their teeth and hair

260
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:28,858
and had ended it
without a single tooth or hair.

261
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:32,403
What for? Why?

262
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:36,032
What was going on in the world?

263
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:41,788
Pierre remembered
he had heard that soldiers in war,

264
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:45,625
if they've taken cover during bombardment
and have nothing to do,

265
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:50,797
try to keep themselves busy
to overcome their fear.

266
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:56,511
To Pierre,
all men seemed to be such soldiers,

267
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:59,514
seeking an escape from life.

268
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:04,978
Some seek escape in ambition,
some in cards, some in making laws,

269
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:07,981
some in women, some in toys,
some in horses,

270
00:35:08,065 --> 00:35:12,026
some in politics, some in hunting,
some in wine,

271
00:35:12,111 --> 00:35:14,988
some in affairs of state.

272
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:19,617
Nothing is trivial. Nothing is important.

273
00:35:19,702 --> 00:35:22,495
The only aim is to save oneself from life,

274
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:25,206
to not face it -

275
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,876
that dreadful life.

276
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:32,130
But, after he'd been drinking,
he told himself it didn't matter.

277
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:36,676
"l'll get it unraveled. l have the clue.
l'll figure it out later."

278
00:35:37,511 --> 00:35:41,222
But that "later" never came.

279
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:02,804
Good morning, UncIe!

280
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:04,806
That's it. Quick march.

281
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:08,309
I knew you wouIdn't be abIe to resist it.

282
00:37:08,394 --> 00:37:10,645
Better attack at once.

283
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:14,440
I hear the IIagins are out hunting, too,
with their dogs.

284
00:37:14,525 --> 00:37:17,402
They'II take the cubs
from under your very nose.

285
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:19,695
I'm on my way.
Lets join up with the pack.

286
00:37:24,535 --> 00:37:26,869
Good morning, UncIe.
We're going too!

287
00:37:26,954 --> 00:37:30,623
Good morning.
See you don't trampIe the dogs.

288
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:35,294
We won't be in the way.
We'II keep to our pIaces.

289
00:37:35,379 --> 00:37:38,589
AII right, IittIe countess.
OnIy don't faII off your horse.

290
00:37:38,674 --> 00:37:42,135
Quick march!
There's nothing to hoId on to!

291
00:37:45,222 --> 00:37:48,182
Where is Natalya llyinishna?

292
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:51,727
She and Pyotr IIyich
are waiting in the high grass.

293
00:37:51,812 --> 00:37:55,314
She's a Iady, but she's fond of the chase.

294
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:59,569
And you're surprised she can ride?

295
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:04,740
She rides as weII as many a man.
Yes! So boId, so easy!

296
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:27,555
If you scare away the woIf,
DaniIa wiII give you heII.

297
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,265
I know what I'm about.

298
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:13,267
They've gotten the scent of the cubs.

299
00:39:23,362 --> 00:39:28,032
They took them to the upIands.

300
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,283
Stay!

301
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:37,333
There!

302
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:05,861
You Iet the woIf go!

303
00:40:05,946 --> 00:40:07,572
CaII themseIves hunters!

304
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:23,546
Dear God,
how would it hurt to do this for me?

305
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:30,011
l know it is a sin to ask this of you,
but let the wolf come my way.

306
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:34,140
Just once in my life
to get a full-grown wolf!

307
00:40:42,024 --> 00:40:43,649
Back or forward?

308
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:47,194
lt's all the same. Forward!

309
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:49,233
He's a prime one!

310
00:43:14,593 --> 00:43:16,260
He's oId and tough.

311
00:43:17,012 --> 00:43:18,888
That he is, Your ExceIIency.

312
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:23,017
As oId and tough as you are.

313
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:07,937
There's the young countess.
That's it. Quick march.

314
00:44:08,939 --> 00:44:10,773
I never saw anything Iike it.

315
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:15,903
Riding aII day Iike a man
and she's as fresh as ever!

316
00:44:43,473 --> 00:44:45,558
Have something to eat, IittIe countess.

317
00:44:54,818 --> 00:44:56,193
Wake up, Petya!

318
00:44:57,821 --> 00:44:59,488
Wake up!

319
00:45:01,575 --> 00:45:05,244
Try this, Petya.
It's simpIy deIicious.

320
00:45:26,391 --> 00:45:28,809
This, you see, is how I Iive out my days.

321
00:45:29,978 --> 00:45:34,023
Death wiII come,
and nothing wiII be Ieft after me.

322
00:45:36,735 --> 00:45:38,652
No more sinning for me.

323
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,219
Open the door.
Why did you shut it?

324
00:46:16,066 --> 00:46:18,317
That's Mitka, my coachman.

325
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:21,278
I bought him a good baIaIaika.
I Iike it.

326
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:35,084
Very good indeed. SpIendid.

327
00:46:35,168 --> 00:46:37,002
SpIendid?

328
00:46:37,087 --> 00:46:39,922
No. SimpIy perfect!

329
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:50,599
More, pIease!

330
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:52,935
More!

331
00:47:12,247 --> 00:47:14,289
You Iike it, dear countess?

332
00:47:18,628 --> 00:47:20,587
So niceIy pIayed.

333
00:47:35,437 --> 00:47:37,438
He doesn't pIay that right.

334
00:47:38,648 --> 00:47:41,191
Here he ought to triII the notes.
Quick march.

335
00:47:41,276 --> 00:47:42,818
TriII.

336
00:47:43,695 --> 00:47:45,487
Can you pIay too?

337
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:49,992
Go see if aII the strings of my guitar
are intact, Anisya.

338
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:02,629
I haven't touched it for months.
That's it. Quick march.

339
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:32,553
DeIightfuI! It's deIightfuI, UncIe!

340
00:49:33,638 --> 00:49:34,930
More! More!

341
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:38,267
Come on, UncIe!

342
00:49:40,603 --> 00:49:41,895
WeII...

343
00:49:43,231 --> 00:49:44,606
Come, Niece!

344
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:12,277
Where, how

345
00:51:12,362 --> 00:51:18,283
and when did she imbibe
this Russian spirit -

346
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:23,705
this young countess,
educated by a French governess?

347
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:25,624
From the air she breathed?

348
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:28,210
Where did she learn those tricks?

349
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:35,384
The spirit and gestures
were genuinely and typically Russian,

350
00:51:35,468 --> 00:51:37,427
just as her uncle expected from her.

351
00:51:37,512 --> 00:51:41,056
How was she able to feel
all that was in Anisya,

352
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:44,559
in Anisya's father and mother

353
00:51:44,644 --> 00:51:46,687
and in every true Russian?

354
00:52:02,412 --> 00:52:04,705
WeII, IittIe countess!

355
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:08,166
That's it. Quick march.
That's my girI!

356
00:52:09,335 --> 00:52:14,631
Now we've got to find you
a worthy young man for a husband.

357
00:52:14,716 --> 00:52:16,341
He's been found aIready.

358
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:23,015
And such a good one.

359
00:52:25,268 --> 00:52:29,813
What did Nikolai's smile mean
when he said that?

360
00:52:30,773 --> 00:52:35,277
Does he think my Bolkonsky
wouldn't understand,

361
00:52:36,279 --> 00:52:38,280
wouldn't approve of our gaiety?

362
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:42,451
No. He'd understand everything.

363
00:52:42,952 --> 00:52:47,664
Where is he is now?
l mustn't think about it.

364
00:52:50,752 --> 00:52:58,300
Night has laid out a blanket

365
00:52:58,384 --> 00:53:05,932
Of newly fallen snow

366
00:53:06,017 --> 00:53:13,732
Sweeping over every pathway

367
00:53:13,816 --> 00:53:21,573
ln the fields below

368
00:53:22,075 --> 00:53:30,248
lt's not sorrow
weighing on the good young man

369
00:53:30,333 --> 00:53:37,381
Grief overwhelms him

370
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:46,223
lt's not sorrow
weighing on the good young man

371
00:53:46,307 --> 00:53:49,393
Grief overwhelms him...

372
00:53:49,477 --> 00:53:52,938
-What were you thinking about just now?
-Me? Wait a minute.

373
00:53:53,022 --> 00:53:56,608
I thought that we were riding aIong

374
00:53:56,692 --> 00:53:58,777
and imagining we were going home.

375
00:53:58,861 --> 00:54:02,030
But we were reaIIy going
heaven knows where.

376
00:54:02,115 --> 00:54:05,283
And finaIIy we arrived and found
that it wasn't home

377
00:54:05,368 --> 00:54:07,536
but an enchanted kingdom.

378
00:54:11,082 --> 00:54:13,542
And then I was thinking -

379
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:21,133
No, nothing eIse.

380
00:54:21,217 --> 00:54:24,845
I know. You were thinking about him.

381
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:26,221
No.

382
00:54:30,226 --> 00:54:36,731
I kept saying to myseIf
how attractive Anisya Iooked.

383
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:39,151
TruIy.

384
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:47,367
I know I shaII never be as happy
and serene as I am now.

385
00:54:47,452 --> 00:54:49,244
Nonsense. FooIishness.

386
00:54:53,583 --> 00:54:55,876
What a darling Natasha is.

387
00:54:57,211 --> 00:55:00,088
l shall never have another such friend.

388
00:55:02,091 --> 00:55:03,925
Why should she marry?

389
00:55:05,678 --> 00:55:07,512
We could ride like this forever.

390
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,893
What a darling Nikolai is.

391
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:39,044
lf only he would come soon.

392
00:55:39,128 --> 00:55:41,630
l'm afraid he never will.

393
00:55:42,048 --> 00:55:45,342
The worst of it is l'm growing old.

394
00:55:45,426 --> 00:55:47,844
l'll lose all my charm.

395
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:52,182
Perhaps he'll come today,
this very minute.

396
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:54,976
Perhaps he came yesterday
and l've forgotten.

397
00:56:15,164 --> 00:56:17,457
What can l ask them to do?

398
00:56:18,376 --> 00:56:20,627
PIease go and -

399
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:25,674
Where shall l send him?

400
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:36,810
Yes. PIease go outside
and bring me... a rooster.

401
00:57:26,485 --> 00:57:28,361
Nastasya Ivanovna.

402
00:57:28,446 --> 00:57:30,030
What sort of chiIdren wiII I have?

403
00:57:30,114 --> 00:57:32,907
You? FIeas.

404
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:37,746
Grasshoppers and dragonflies.

405
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:45,795
Oh, God, it's always the same.

406
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:48,298
Where shall l go?

407
00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:50,258
What shall l do with myself?

408
00:57:57,099 --> 00:58:01,019
The island of Ma-da-gas-car.

409
00:58:03,773 --> 00:58:06,107
Madagascar?

410
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:10,070
Madagascar.

411
00:58:28,923 --> 00:58:32,967
Do you ever feeI as if
there were nothing more to come?

412
00:58:33,636 --> 00:58:34,803
Nothing.

413
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:39,057
Everything good has aIready happened.

414
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:43,269
Doesn't it make you sad?

415
00:58:43,354 --> 00:58:44,688
Yes, often.

416
00:58:48,359 --> 00:58:50,902
I feIt Iike that
even when everything was fine.

417
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:56,491
Then it occurred to me how sick at heart
I was and to die was of no consequence.

418
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:02,914
Once in the regiment,
I did not go to a party.

419
00:59:02,998 --> 00:59:05,959
I heard the music

420
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:09,587
and suddenIy feIt so depressed.

421
00:59:09,922 --> 00:59:13,007
I know. I know.

422
00:59:14,218 --> 00:59:17,679
I feIt the same once when I was a chiId.

423
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:20,932
I had been punished for taking some pIums.

424
00:59:21,016 --> 00:59:25,937
Everybody was dancing,
and I sat upstairs crying.

425
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:27,605
I'II never forget it.

426
00:59:29,608 --> 00:59:32,318
I feIt so sad and so sorry.

427
00:59:32,403 --> 00:59:34,779
For myseIf and everybody eIse.

428
00:59:34,864 --> 00:59:37,657
I hadn't taken those pIums.
Do you remember?

429
00:59:37,742 --> 00:59:40,577
I remember. I came to you.

430
00:59:40,661 --> 00:59:45,415
I wanted to comfort you,
but I was too shy.

431
00:59:45,499 --> 00:59:47,500
We were so funny then.

432
00:59:51,213 --> 00:59:56,217
I had a IittIe toy
that I wanted to give you.

433
00:59:57,344 --> 00:59:59,554
Do you remember this, Sonya?

434
00:59:59,638 --> 01:00:02,390
Yes, vagueIy.

435
01:00:04,769 --> 01:00:08,813
It seems so strange now,
Iike something in a dream.

436
01:00:08,898 --> 01:00:10,398
I Iove that.

437
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:17,155
And do you remember how Father,
wearing his bIue coat,

438
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:19,491
fired a gun on the porch?

439
01:00:19,575 --> 01:00:24,078
Do you remember how funny it was?

440
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:27,791
Miss, they've brought the rooster.

441
01:00:27,875 --> 01:00:30,376
TeII them to take it back.

442
01:00:33,672 --> 01:00:36,090
You know,

443
01:00:36,175 --> 01:00:41,721
I think that when one goes on and on
recaIIing things - recaIIing everything -

444
01:00:41,806 --> 01:00:47,769
one at Iast begins to remember
what happened before one was born.

445
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:50,772
It's metempsychosis.

446
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:57,946
The Egyptians beIieved that our souIs
inhabited the bodies of animaIs.

447
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:03,868
No. I don't beIieve
that we were ever animaIs.

448
01:01:03,953 --> 01:01:10,208
I am sure we were angeIs
somewhere out there

449
01:01:10,292 --> 01:01:12,836
and have been here before
and that's why we remember things.

450
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:16,923
If we were angeIs, why did we faII so Iow?

451
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:18,550
This can't be.

452
01:01:18,634 --> 01:01:21,594
Not Iower. Who said we were Iower?

453
01:01:28,352 --> 01:01:32,313
How do I know what I was before?

454
01:01:33,774 --> 01:01:35,692
The souI is immortaI.

455
01:01:37,486 --> 01:01:40,572
If I'm to Iive forever,

456
01:01:40,656 --> 01:01:42,407
I must have Iived before,

457
01:01:43,993 --> 01:01:45,577
Iived for a whoIe eternity.

458
01:01:45,661 --> 01:01:49,706
It's hard to imagine eternity.

459
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:52,542
Why do you think so?

460
01:01:52,918 --> 01:01:56,588
There is today, there is tomorrow,
there is eternity.

461
01:01:56,672 --> 01:02:00,008
And there was yesterday
and the day before -

462
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:03,511
The mummers have come!

463
01:04:39,501 --> 01:04:42,336
-Natasha!
-Did you see him? What did you see?

464
01:04:44,173 --> 01:04:45,173
Yes.

465
01:04:46,133 --> 01:04:48,092
I saw him.

466
01:04:48,177 --> 01:04:50,428
How? Standing up or Iying down?

467
01:04:50,512 --> 01:04:54,057
At first, there was nothing.
Then I saw him Iying down.

468
01:04:54,141 --> 01:04:55,933
Andrei Iying down? Was he iII?

469
01:04:56,018 --> 01:04:59,520
No, his face was cheerfuI,
and he turned to me.

470
01:04:59,605 --> 01:05:01,522
Then what?

471
01:05:01,607 --> 01:05:03,691
I couIdn't see.

472
01:05:03,776 --> 01:05:06,027
Something bIue and red.

473
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:07,278
Sonya.

474
01:05:10,365 --> 01:05:12,617
When wiII he come back?

475
01:05:12,701 --> 01:05:14,619
When shaII I see him?

476
01:05:15,579 --> 01:05:18,414
Dear God! I'm so afraid for him
and for myseIf...

477
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:21,542
and for everything.

478
01:05:26,757 --> 01:05:32,553
Prince Andrei wishes me to reduce
his year by three months.

479
01:05:32,638 --> 01:05:35,306
Write and teII him to wait tiII I die.

480
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:38,476
It won't be Iong.
I'II soon set him free.

481
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:42,772
Marry, my son. A fine connection.

482
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:47,902
CIever peopIe, eh? Rich, eh?

483
01:05:49,404 --> 01:05:53,324
LittIe NikoIai
wiII have a nice stepmother.

484
01:05:54,535 --> 01:05:57,411
Write and teII him he may
marry tomorrow if he Iikes.

485
01:05:57,496 --> 01:05:59,205
And I'II marry Miss Bourienne.

486
01:06:00,582 --> 01:06:03,417
Then he'II have a stepmother too.

487
01:06:03,502 --> 01:06:07,588
Just one thing -
no more women in my house.

488
01:06:08,882 --> 01:06:12,343
Perhaps you can go Iive with him too.
By God!

489
01:06:12,427 --> 01:06:14,345
Out in the coId! Go!

490
01:06:15,806 --> 01:06:19,433
The count's things here.
The young Iady's to the Ieft.

491
01:06:20,769 --> 01:06:22,937
You've fiIIed out. You're even prettier.

492
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:24,939
My, you're coId!

493
01:06:25,023 --> 01:06:26,732
Maria Dmitrievna.

494
01:06:26,817 --> 01:06:29,318
My wife is iII, and our house is unheated.

495
01:06:29,403 --> 01:06:31,696
So I took you up on your invitation.
Here I am.

496
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:34,824
High time.
I'm gIad you're staying with me.

497
01:06:34,908 --> 01:06:38,494
OId BoIkonsky is in Moscow.
His son is coming.

498
01:06:38,579 --> 01:06:40,913
You must make his acquaintance.

499
01:06:49,464 --> 01:06:52,884
The prince is not receiving.

500
01:06:52,968 --> 01:06:54,969
But the princess begs you to see her.

501
01:07:05,314 --> 01:07:09,275
There, Princess,
I've brought you my IittIe songbird.

502
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:12,653
I'm so gIad you've become acquainted.

503
01:07:13,655 --> 01:07:18,034
I've wanted to do so for a Iong time.
I'm very gIad.

504
01:07:20,996 --> 01:07:24,749
I'm sorry your father is unweII.

505
01:07:27,044 --> 01:07:29,462
If you aIIow me, Princess,

506
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:32,757
I'II Ieave my Natasha in your hands
for a IittIe whiIe.

507
01:07:32,841 --> 01:07:37,261
I'II drive round to see Anna Semenovna.

508
01:07:37,346 --> 01:07:40,264
Then I'II come back for her.

509
01:07:41,016 --> 01:07:45,603
PIease, Count, take your time
visiting Anna Semenovna.

510
01:08:01,954 --> 01:08:08,542
Dear NataIie, you know, I'm so gIad
my brother has found happiness.

511
01:08:13,423 --> 01:08:16,884
I think maybe, Princess,
this isn't the time to taIk about it.

512
01:08:30,565 --> 01:08:33,901
Ah, madam. Madam.

513
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:39,156
Countess?
Countess Rostova, if I am not mistaken.

514
01:08:39,241 --> 01:08:43,327
I beg you to forgive me. Forgive me.

515
01:08:45,289 --> 01:08:51,210
With God as my witness, I did not know
you had honored us with a visit.

516
01:08:52,337 --> 01:08:55,506
I came to see my daughter
dressed Iike this.

517
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:58,050
PIease excuse me.
With God as my witness.

518
01:09:00,053 --> 01:09:04,432
PIease forgive me.

519
01:09:42,304 --> 01:09:45,097
What do his father and sister
matter to me?

520
01:09:45,182 --> 01:09:47,933
l love just him, him alone!

521
01:09:49,478 --> 01:09:53,397
lt's best l don't think of him,
forget him for the time being.

522
01:09:57,194 --> 01:10:00,946
Look at Anna MikhaiIovna.
What a toque she has on.

523
01:10:01,031 --> 01:10:04,367
It's the Karagins with JuIie and Boris.

524
01:10:04,451 --> 01:10:07,078
It's easy to see that they're engaged.

525
01:10:07,162 --> 01:10:10,581
Drubetskoy has proposed.
So I've heard.

526
01:10:30,268 --> 01:10:31,769
Have you been here Iong, Countess?

527
01:10:32,854 --> 01:10:37,441
I'm here on business,
and I've brought my girIs with me.

528
01:10:38,193 --> 01:10:40,945
They say Semenova's acting is superb.

529
01:11:55,896 --> 01:11:58,981
Here he is - Kuragin.

530
01:18:23,491 --> 01:18:24,992
I cannot visit you.

531
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:27,536
ShaII I never see you again?

532
01:18:30,456 --> 01:18:32,666
I'm madIy in Iove with you.

533
01:18:34,544 --> 01:18:36,295
It is possibIe that I shaII never -

534
01:18:41,301 --> 01:18:45,846
NataIie.

535
01:19:10,705 --> 01:19:12,205
One word.

536
01:19:13,124 --> 01:19:15,125
Just one.

537
01:19:15,209 --> 01:19:17,502
For God's sake, NataIie.

538
01:19:17,587 --> 01:19:19,254
One word.

539
01:19:20,715 --> 01:19:22,299
Just one.

540
01:19:35,605 --> 01:19:37,064
PIease, Miss.

541
01:19:37,607 --> 01:19:39,441
A man toId me to give you this.

542
01:19:39,525 --> 01:19:41,109
OnIy for the Iove of Christ -

543
01:19:45,406 --> 01:19:48,408
Since last night,
my fate has been sealed -

544
01:19:48,493 --> 01:19:51,328
to be loved by you or die.

545
01:19:51,412 --> 01:19:53,163
There can be no other outcome.

546
01:20:21,484 --> 01:20:23,777
-You know what.
-WeII, what?

547
01:20:24,278 --> 01:20:26,571
You'd better drop aII this.
There's stiII time.

548
01:20:26,656 --> 01:20:29,282
FooI! Don't taIk nonsense.

549
01:20:30,326 --> 01:20:34,246
If you onIy knew -
The deviI knows what!

550
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:38,834
It's no joke, I teII you true,
this thing you're pIanning.

551
01:20:40,503 --> 01:20:43,046
Stop taunting me, damn you!

552
01:20:43,131 --> 01:20:46,925
I heIped you out, but, aII the same,
I must teII you the truth.

553
01:20:47,427 --> 01:20:52,180
It's a dangerous business
and, if you think about it, stupid.

554
01:20:52,807 --> 01:20:56,643
You can carry her off, aII right,
but it won't end at that.

555
01:20:56,728 --> 01:21:00,772
They'II find out you're married
and take you to court.

556
01:21:02,316 --> 01:21:04,443
Nonsense. Nonsense!

557
01:21:04,944 --> 01:21:06,737
Didn't I expIain it to you?

558
01:21:06,821 --> 01:21:11,825
If this marriage is invaIid,
I have nothing to answer for.

559
01:21:11,909 --> 01:21:14,828
But if it is vaIid,
no one abroad wiII know about it.

560
01:21:14,912 --> 01:21:17,873
Don't speak to me about it.

561
01:21:17,957 --> 01:21:19,875
You'II just hang yourseIf.

562
01:21:19,959 --> 01:21:21,293
Go to the deviI!

563
01:21:22,295 --> 01:21:24,337
You don't know what I'm going through.

564
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:27,090
FeeI how it's beating!

565
01:21:27,842 --> 01:21:30,135
What IittIe feet!

566
01:21:30,219 --> 01:21:33,555
What eyes! A goddess!

567
01:21:33,639 --> 01:21:36,266
And when the money's gone, what then?

568
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:38,477
What then?

569
01:21:38,895 --> 01:21:41,563
What then? I don't know.

570
01:21:41,647 --> 01:21:43,774
But why taIk nonsense!

571
01:21:46,194 --> 01:21:49,780
I can't hide it from you any Ionger,
Sonya.

572
01:21:49,864 --> 01:21:51,198
You know -

573
01:21:52,867 --> 01:21:55,077
We Iove each other.

574
01:21:55,161 --> 01:21:57,871
He writes me! Sonya!

575
01:21:59,082 --> 01:22:00,040
And BoIkonsky?

576
01:22:00,124 --> 01:22:02,834
If you onIy knew how happy I am!

577
01:22:02,919 --> 01:22:04,795
You don't know this kind of Iove.

578
01:22:04,879 --> 01:22:07,631
Natasha, is it reaIIy over?

579
01:22:08,382 --> 01:22:10,675
Are you refusing Prince Andrei?

580
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:12,886
You don't understand.
Stop your nonsense.

581
01:22:12,970 --> 01:22:14,346
Just Iisten!

582
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:17,140
I can't aIIow this. I'II teII.

583
01:22:17,225 --> 01:22:19,976
If you do, you are my enemy!
Do you want to ruin me?

584
01:22:20,061 --> 01:22:21,770
Do you want them to tear us apart?

585
01:22:21,854 --> 01:22:26,108
No one has the right to interfere.
I confided in you.

586
01:22:26,192 --> 01:22:30,695
Why this secrecy? Why doesn't
he openIy ask for your hand?

587
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:32,155
Prince Andrei gave you compIete freedom.

588
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:34,991
You mustn't doubt him!
Do you understand?

589
01:22:35,076 --> 01:22:37,452
-What if he's deceiving you?
-I can't Iive without him!

590
01:22:37,537 --> 01:22:40,956
Natasha!
You don't know what you're saying!

591
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:42,666
What are you saying?

592
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:44,334
Think of your father, of NikoIai.

593
01:22:44,418 --> 01:22:47,838
I don't want anyone but him. I Iove him.
How can you caII him dishonest?

594
01:22:47,922 --> 01:22:49,798
You don't understand that I Iove him!

595
01:22:49,882 --> 01:22:52,968
I don't want to argue.
Go away, for God's sake!

596
01:22:53,344 --> 01:22:54,886
You see how I'm suffering.

597
01:22:58,599 --> 01:23:02,978
WeII, my oId friends,
we've had good times.

598
01:23:03,062 --> 01:23:06,148
When shaII we meet again?
I am going abroad.

599
01:23:06,232 --> 01:23:07,607
FareweII, my friends. To us!

600
01:23:15,116 --> 01:23:16,825
Time to go!

601
01:23:16,909 --> 01:23:18,618
Where's the fur cIoak?

602
01:23:19,829 --> 01:23:24,416
Go and ask Matryona for the sabIe cIoak.

603
01:23:25,293 --> 01:23:28,962
She'II rush out at wits' end
in whatever she has on.

604
01:23:29,046 --> 01:23:33,466
Any hesitation, there'II be tears.
"Oh, Papa! Oh, Mama!"

605
01:23:33,551 --> 01:23:35,385
She'II start to freeze
and need to go back.

606
01:23:35,469 --> 01:23:40,140
But you! Wrap the cIoak around her
and carry her to the sIeigh.

607
01:23:41,142 --> 01:23:44,019
Idiot! I toId you the sabIe one!

608
01:23:44,103 --> 01:23:47,105
Matrena! The sabIe coat!

609
01:23:49,609 --> 01:23:54,279
Here, I don't begrudge it.
You take it!

610
01:23:58,284 --> 01:24:00,035
Like this.

611
01:24:01,454 --> 01:24:03,205
And then Iike this! You see?

612
01:24:17,511 --> 01:24:19,638
Giddap! Hey!

613
01:24:59,762 --> 01:25:01,513
She'II come out directIy.

614
01:25:04,725 --> 01:25:08,478
-The mistress wishes to see you, sir.
-Who are you?

615
01:25:08,562 --> 01:25:12,857
Kuragin! Come back!
We've been betrayed!

616
01:25:41,804 --> 01:25:45,390
Maria Dmitrievna! Let me in to see her!

617
01:25:45,474 --> 01:25:49,227
You shameIess hussy!

618
01:25:49,312 --> 01:25:51,688
You are a nice one. Such a nice one!

619
01:25:51,772 --> 01:25:55,191
Meeting your Iovers in my own house!

620
01:25:55,276 --> 01:25:58,862
Stop pretending!
Listen when I speak to you!

621
01:25:58,946 --> 01:26:02,532
You've disgraced and demeaned yourseIf.
Like a common wench!

622
01:26:02,616 --> 01:26:06,703
I'd deaI with you differentIy,
if I wasn't sorry for your father.

623
01:26:06,787 --> 01:26:08,330
I teII you frankIy.

624
01:26:08,414 --> 01:26:11,958
He's Iucky to have escaped me,
but I'II find him!

625
01:26:13,294 --> 01:26:17,213
Are you Iistening to what I'm saying?

626
01:26:17,757 --> 01:26:23,136
Let me be! What does it matter?
I shaII die!

627
01:26:24,472 --> 01:26:28,475
NataIya.

628
01:26:29,685 --> 01:26:32,145
I wish you onIy good.

629
01:26:32,229 --> 01:26:33,730
There.

630
01:26:33,814 --> 01:26:37,567
Lie stiII. I won't touch you.

631
01:26:37,651 --> 01:26:42,405
Your father wiII be here tomorrow.
What am I to teII him?

632
01:26:42,490 --> 01:26:45,241
What if he finds out?
And your brother and your fiancé?

633
01:26:45,326 --> 01:26:47,577
I have no fiancé! I turned him down!

634
01:26:47,661 --> 01:26:49,162
It doesn't matter.

635
01:26:49,246 --> 01:26:52,499
If he hears of this, he won't keep quiet.

636
01:26:52,583 --> 01:26:54,793
I know your father.

637
01:26:54,877 --> 01:26:59,130
He wiII chaIIenge him to a dueI.
How fine wiII that be?

638
01:27:00,299 --> 01:27:01,841
Let me be!

639
01:27:01,926 --> 01:27:04,761
Why did you interfere? Why? Why?

640
01:27:04,845 --> 01:27:06,596
Who asked you?

641
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:10,642
What do you want?
What if he'd taken you?

642
01:27:10,726 --> 01:27:13,269
Do you think they wouIdn't have found him?

643
01:27:13,354 --> 01:27:17,190
He's a scoundreI! A bIackguard!

644
01:27:17,274 --> 01:27:20,652
He is better than aII of you!
Why did you interfere?

645
01:27:23,072 --> 01:27:26,408
Oh, my God! What is this?

646
01:27:26,492 --> 01:27:28,827
Sonya! Why did you do it?

647
01:27:34,208 --> 01:27:35,959
Go away!

648
01:27:36,043 --> 01:27:39,379
You aII hate me! You despise me!

649
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:49,848
You are a scoundreI and a bIackguard!

650
01:27:49,932 --> 01:27:54,602
I don't know what stops me
from smashing your skuII.

651
01:27:59,567 --> 01:28:03,153
Did you promise to marry her?
-I didn't think -

652
01:28:03,237 --> 01:28:05,655
I never promised.
I am married, as you may know.

653
01:28:05,739 --> 01:28:08,658
Have you any of her Ietters?
Her Ietters!

654
01:28:15,249 --> 01:28:17,250
I won't do anything.
Don't be afraid.

655
01:28:22,256 --> 01:28:24,090
The Ietters. That's first.

656
01:28:25,259 --> 01:28:29,345
Second, tomorrow,
you must get out of Moscow.

657
01:28:29,430 --> 01:28:31,681
-But how can I -
-Third.

658
01:28:31,765 --> 01:28:34,017
You must never -

659
01:28:34,101 --> 01:28:37,437
Not a word of what happened
between you and the countess.

660
01:28:39,940 --> 01:28:43,109
I know I can't prevent you.

661
01:28:44,862 --> 01:28:48,781
But if you have a spark of conscience -

662
01:28:54,538 --> 01:28:57,707
Amuse yourseIf with women Iike my wife.

663
01:28:58,626 --> 01:29:00,877
There, you're within you're rights.

664
01:29:00,961 --> 01:29:03,379
They know what you want of them.

665
01:29:03,464 --> 01:29:07,425
They are armed against you
by the same experience of debauchery.

666
01:29:08,469 --> 01:29:13,097
But to promise an innocent girI
to marry her -

667
01:29:13,182 --> 01:29:17,143
To deceive, to abduct her.

668
01:29:17,811 --> 01:29:23,316
Don't you understand that's as despicabIe
as beating an oId woman or a chiId?

669
01:29:25,277 --> 01:29:28,154
I don't know about that.

670
01:29:28,239 --> 01:29:30,823
I don't know, nor do I wish to know.

671
01:29:32,868 --> 01:29:37,497
But you have used such words
as "Iow" and "scoundreI."

672
01:29:37,581 --> 01:29:41,251
As a man of honor,
I cannot aIIow this to pass.

673
01:29:41,335 --> 01:29:45,380
Though they were said without witnesses,
I stiII can't aIIow it.

674
01:29:46,966 --> 01:29:49,425
Is it satisfaction you want?

675
01:29:50,261 --> 01:29:56,933
You couId at Ieast take your words back
if you want me to do as you wish.

676
01:29:57,017 --> 01:29:59,936
I take them back.

677
01:30:00,020 --> 01:30:01,813
I even ask you to forgive me.

678
01:30:02,815 --> 01:30:05,149
And if you require money
for your journey -

679
01:30:12,575 --> 01:30:17,537
Oh, viIe and heartIess breed!

680
01:30:24,211 --> 01:30:28,590
PIease return these Ietters and portrait
to the countess if you see her.

681
01:30:29,550 --> 01:30:31,801
She is very iII.

682
01:30:31,885 --> 01:30:34,220
Then she is stiII here?
And Prince Kuragin?

683
01:30:34,305 --> 01:30:36,806
He Ieft Iong ago.

684
01:30:36,890 --> 01:30:39,726
She was at death's door.

685
01:30:40,561 --> 01:30:42,312
I much regret her iIIness.

686
01:30:42,396 --> 01:30:47,108
So Mr. Kuragin did not offer his hand
to Countess Rostov.

687
01:30:47,192 --> 01:30:51,362
He couId not do so
because he is married aIready.

688
01:30:54,033 --> 01:30:57,660
Where is your brother-in-Iaw now,
if I may ask?

689
01:30:57,745 --> 01:31:00,371
I beIieve he has gone to St. Petersburg.
I'm not sure.

690
01:31:00,456 --> 01:31:02,332
WeII, that's not important.

691
01:31:02,416 --> 01:31:06,919
TeII the countess
that she was and is perfectIy free

692
01:31:07,004 --> 01:31:08,838
and that I wish her weII.

693
01:31:11,550 --> 01:31:15,928
Do you remember our discussion
in St. Petersburg?

694
01:31:16,013 --> 01:31:19,349
I said that a faIIen woman
shouId be forgiven.

695
01:31:19,433 --> 01:31:23,269
But I didn't say that / couId forgive her.
I can't.

696
01:31:23,354 --> 01:31:25,521
How can you compare?

697
01:31:25,606 --> 01:31:28,858
Ask for her hand again?
Be magnanimous?

698
01:31:28,942 --> 01:31:33,613
But I am unabIe to foIIow
in that gentIeman's footsteps.

699
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:38,534
If you wish to be my friend,
never speak to me of this.

700
01:31:42,623 --> 01:31:44,248
Of any of this.

701
01:31:44,583 --> 01:31:46,167
WeII, good-bye. You'II give it to her?

702
01:32:17,157 --> 01:32:18,491
Pyotr KiriIych.

703
01:32:20,327 --> 01:32:24,205
Prince BoIkonsky was your friend.
He stiII is.

704
01:32:24,289 --> 01:32:26,791
He toId me once to turn to you.

705
01:32:28,127 --> 01:32:29,669
He is here now.

706
01:32:32,756 --> 01:32:35,633
TeII him...

707
01:32:43,142 --> 01:32:44,892
to forgive me.

708
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:48,354
I'II teII him, but -

709
01:32:48,439 --> 01:32:51,315
I know it's over. It can never be.

710
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:52,734
I am tormented...

711
01:32:54,903 --> 01:32:57,989
by the wrong I have done him.

712
01:32:58,073 --> 01:33:00,491
TeII him I beg him to forgive me,

713
01:33:00,576 --> 01:33:03,035
to forgive me for everything.

714
01:33:06,832 --> 01:33:08,332
I wiII teII him.

715
01:33:09,376 --> 01:33:11,335
I wiII certainIy teII him.

716
01:33:12,087 --> 01:33:15,506
I shouId Iike to know one thing.

717
01:33:20,053 --> 01:33:22,346
I wouId Iike to know,

718
01:33:22,431 --> 01:33:24,182
were you in Iove -

719
01:33:27,603 --> 01:33:30,897
Were you in Iove with that viIe man?

720
01:33:32,733 --> 01:33:34,317
Don't caII him viIe!

721
01:33:37,070 --> 01:33:39,614
I don't know. I don't know!

722
01:33:51,919 --> 01:33:55,087
We won't speak of it again, my dear.

723
01:33:56,256 --> 01:33:59,008
I'II teII him everything, and I beg you -

724
01:34:00,219 --> 01:34:02,220
Consider me your friend.

725
01:34:02,805 --> 01:34:05,681
If you want heIp or advice,

726
01:34:05,766 --> 01:34:09,811
if you simpIy want to open
your heart to someone -

727
01:34:10,979 --> 01:34:15,274
not now, but when your mind is cIearer -

728
01:34:17,110 --> 01:34:18,861
think of me.

729
01:34:25,244 --> 01:34:29,205
I shaII be happy if it is in my power -

730
01:34:29,289 --> 01:34:32,416
Don't speak to me Iike that.
I am not worth it!

731
01:34:33,627 --> 01:34:37,380
Stop it.
You have your whoIe Iife ahead of you.

732
01:34:37,464 --> 01:34:38,965
Ahead of me?

733
01:34:40,050 --> 01:34:43,094
No, it's aII over for me.

734
01:34:46,974 --> 01:34:48,683
AII over?

735
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:56,941
If I were not... what I am,

736
01:34:57,025 --> 01:35:02,113
but the handsomest, most cIever
and best man in the worId -

737
01:35:02,197 --> 01:35:04,532
and if I were free -

738
01:35:04,616 --> 01:35:09,453
at this moment I wouId be on my knees
to beg for your hand

739
01:35:12,708 --> 01:35:14,208
and your Iove.

740
01:36:05,636 --> 01:36:09,305
lt seemed to Pierre that this falling star

741
01:36:09,389 --> 01:36:14,310
was a symbol of what was passing
in his own softened and emboldened soul

742
01:36:14,394 --> 01:36:18,314
which brimmed
with the blossoming of new life.

743
01:36:47,094 --> 01:36:52,765
On June 12, the armies of Western Europe
crossed the Russian frontier,

744
01:36:52,849 --> 01:36:56,102
and the war began.

745
01:36:57,521 --> 01:37:00,648
That is, an event took place

746
01:37:00,732 --> 01:37:03,275
that was counter to human reason

747
01:37:04,444 --> 01:37:07,905
and human nature.

748
01:37:34,599 --> 01:37:44,984
