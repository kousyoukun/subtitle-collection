1
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:11,602
阿者言无 鼻者名间 为无时间
Avici Hell. Also known as Continuous Hell.

2
00:01:12,036 --> 00:01:16,200
为无空间 为无量受业报之界
Uninterrupted Time. Unlimited Space. Boundless suffering for the fallen souls.

3
00:01:17,571 --> 00:01:20,131
无时间
Uninterrupted Time

4
00:01:21,471 --> 00:01:23,471
{\an8}(时间)
(Time)

5
00:01:22,675 --> 00:01:25,365
我还记得我第一次抓那个犯人
I still remember my first arrest.

6
00:01:26,674 --> 00:01:28,474
{\an8}(1991年)
(1991)

7
00:01:28,473 --> 00:01:30,805
那天是八零年十二月十二日
It was December 12, 1980.

8
00:01:34,341 --> 00:01:36,673
我跟一个师兄在河内道巡逻
My partner and I were patrolling Hanoi Road.

9
00:01:36,715 --> 00:01:41,076
那么收到通知 说新世界有案件发生
Shit was going down at New World Centre.

10
00:01:41,343 --> 00:01:43,140
我们俩立刻赶去
We rushed over.

11
00:01:43,643 --> 00:01:46,584
到了现场 看见几十个人挥舞刀棍正在械斗
A gang fight was taking place.

12
00:01:46,585 --> 00:01:49,772
有十几个已经倒在地上
About 15 or so were already down.

13
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:52,268
地上有好多血
Lots of blood on the ground.

14
00:01:53,945 --> 00:01:56,436
我更看见一只握了刀的断手
Plus a severed hand, still holding a knife.

15
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,676
师兄叫我开枪
My partner told me to draw my weapon.

16
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,546
当时我是个新丁 师兄说什么我就做什么 是吧!
I was a rookie so I did what he told me to.

17
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:11,329
谁知道我还没来得及打开枪套呢
But before I could open the holster,

18
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:15,379
师兄已经"扑通" 跌倒在我面前了
My partner already dropped

19
00:02:16,283 --> 00:02:20,652
我看见那小子拿根铁管插进师兄的肚子里
This kid stabbed a pipe into his belly

20
00:02:21,751 --> 00:02:24,982
那血呢 就不停从那里面流出来
Blood gushed out of the sawed-off opening

21
00:02:26,685 --> 00:02:28,269
当时我的脑袋一片空白
I didn't know what to think.

22
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,155
只知道把六颗子弹
I simply emptied all six of my bullets 

23
00:02:30,156 --> 00:02:32,983
一下子全打在那小子的身上
straight into that kid.

24
00:02:35,354 --> 00:02:37,879
后来那小子判了多少年我记的不大清楚
I don't remember how many years he got.

25
00:02:39,754 --> 00:02:42,075
两年前 我又遇上那小子了
But when I saw him again two years ago,

26
00:02:42,076 --> 00:02:46,277
穿的衣着光鲜 跟一伙人在富豪喝酒
he was boozing in a club, looking sharp.

27
00:02:46,278 --> 00:02:50,616
跟着一块的那几个人呢 就是倪坤的手下
His buddies were all Kwun's goons!

28
00:02:54,557 --> 00:02:59,517
杀人放火金腰带 修桥补路无尸骸
Evil prevails. Only the good die young.

29
00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:08,453
那个师兄长什么样子我已经很模糊了
I can barely recall my partner's face now.

30
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,384
我很后悔
I regret...

31
00:03:11,523 --> 00:03:15,395
那六枪没打在那小子的头上
the six bullets weren't put into that kid's skull.

32
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:23,425
世界不应该是这样
The world shouldn't be like this.

33
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,188
做人不应该是这样 琛
That's not the way it should be, Sam.

34
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:35,864
你来尖沙嘴多久?
How long have you been around Tsim Sha Tsui?

35
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,793
快两年了吧
Almost two years now.

36
00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:44,228
你知不知道这两年来我为什么没有抓你?
Do you know why I haven't messed with you?

37
00:03:45,004 --> 00:03:46,625
我长得帅吧
'Cause I'm handsome.

38
00:03:48,268 --> 00:03:49,701
可能是吧
Maybe so.

39
00:03:50,774 --> 00:03:53,572
因为我觉得你还像个人
'Cause I think you 're a decent guy.

40
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:59,877
如果尖沙嘴是你的地头 我就清闲多了
I'd rather you be in charge in Tsim Sha Tsui.

41
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:01,411
算了吧
Forget about it.

42
00:04:01,412 --> 00:04:03,735
六颗子弹都没打死那小子
You couldn't waste the kid even with six bullets.

43
00:04:04,171 --> 00:04:05,638
你也算是个好人 对吧?
That makes you a decent guy, too. Right?

44
00:04:06,605 --> 00:04:10,837
别笑话我了 这个好人我宁愿不做
Let me put it this way. I'd rather not be one.

45
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:21,010
我这条命 是坤哥给我的
Kwun gave me everything, even my life.

46
00:04:21,942 --> 00:04:25,355
我要是帮你对付他 我还算是个人吗?
If I turned against him

47
00:04:25,356 --> 00:04:28,443
你也会看不起我吧 对不对?
I'd be despicable even in your eyes. Right?

48
00:04:29,991 --> 00:04:34,637
- 早就料到你是这样 - 本来就是嘛
- I knew you 'd say that. - Yeah!

49
00:04:35,011 --> 00:04:39,038
不过为倪家做事呢 不能只讲义气
Chivalry means little to the Ngai's Family

50
00:04:44,713 --> 00:04:46,476
师傅常常告诫我
The Master often says...

51
00:04:47,514 --> 00:04:50,176
因果报应总有时
"Retribution knows its time."

52
00:04:52,315 --> 00:04:55,751
我也害怕最后几年不能和你吃饭
Who knows how you and I will end up?

53
00:04:59,071 --> 00:05:00,808
开工了
Time to work.

54
00:05:02,217 --> 00:05:04,405
还早呢 这么拼命干什么?
This early? What's the rush?

55
00:05:04,406 --> 00:05:06,073
我不吃 小的也要吃啊
I've got to eat. So do my boys.

56
00:05:06,074 --> 00:05:08,351
全都拿走吧 还有这个
Take the whole box.

57
00:05:08,585 --> 00:05:09,207
不要了 留给你吧
That's okay. Keep it.

58
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:12,006
不用了 走吧
Don't worry about it. Just go.

59
00:05:12,876 --> 00:05:13,865
走了
Gotta go.

60
00:05:19,613 --> 00:05:21,911
要不要带你走后门?
Want to use the back door?

61
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:25,722
条例没规定不许跟警察做朋友吧
Ain't no rules against schmoozing with cops.

62
00:05:26,455 --> 00:05:28,446
走正门行了 习惯了
The front door's fine. Got used to it.

63
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:46,121
宝勒巷
Prat Avenue!

64
00:06:08,097 --> 00:06:09,496
宝勒巷 劳驾
Prat Avenue, please.

65
00:07:39,215 --> 00:07:40,341
我找坤叔
Is Uncle Kwun in?

66
00:07:42,183 --> 00:07:43,980
坤叔 有人找你
Uncle Kwun! Someone's looking for you .

67
00:08:40,402 --> 00:08:42,088
我走了 Mary姐
Bye, Mary.

68
00:08:57,265 --> 00:08:58,994
这部美国古董机
They say this American antique's got

69
00:08:59,232 --> 00:09:03,396
有人说它高音甜 中音准 低音劲什么的
a sweet high, crisp middle, and strong bass.

70
00:09:04,066 --> 00:09:05,761
真是瞎扯蛋
Bullshit!

71
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,731
要十八万呢
180 grand!

72
00:09:07,934 --> 00:09:10,129
香港有多少人买得起?
Who can afford it in Hong Kong?

73
00:09:10,768 --> 00:09:11,735
坐
Sit.

74
00:09:15,803 --> 00:09:18,499
玩得起的人有一万多
Only around ten thousand people can afford it

75
00:09:18,736 --> 00:09:20,829
琛哥叫你去警察那边做卧底
Sam asked you to be a mole in the force.

76
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:24,253
你要是不喜欢 我去跟他说一声
If you don't like it, I can talk to him.

77
00:09:24,254 --> 00:09:26,620
怎么说你也是我的人
You're my boy after all

78
00:09:29,005 --> 00:09:29,937
没事
It's fine with me.

79
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:32,394
真的没事?
Sure?

80
00:09:34,239 --> 00:09:35,365
真的
Positive.

81
00:09:38,474 --> 00:09:39,600
帮我把那个袋子拿过来
Hand me that bag.

82
00:09:43,063 --> 00:09:44,700
玛莉姐
Mary.

83
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:50,276
我看你最近无精打采的 还以为你不想去呢
I thought you'd been dreading it

84
00:09:51,376 --> 00:09:54,470
这几天风声紧 回屯门蹲一段时间吧
Hide in Tuen Mun till things quiet down.

85
00:09:55,143 --> 00:09:57,202
炼好身体等警察学校开学
Stay fit for the Academy's new term.

86
00:10:00,344 --> 00:10:03,142
给你这笔钱 省着点用
The money I gave you, spend wisely.

87
00:10:06,612 --> 00:10:08,079
喜欢这首歌?
You like the song?

88
00:10:10,046 --> 00:10:11,138
是啊
Yeah.

89
00:10:16,514 --> 00:10:17,776
送给你
It's yours.

90
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:21,109
但是用别的机子放 效果差很远
It won't sound as good on another player.

91
00:10:22,183 --> 00:10:24,981
以后赚到钱 我给你找一部好的
Someday I'll pick out a good one for you

92
00:10:26,848 --> 00:10:29,409
怎么 不喜欢?
What? Don't like it?

93
00:10:31,318 --> 00:10:32,478
不是
Not at all.

94
00:10:32,884 --> 00:10:34,613
这表 琛哥送给你的?
Sam gave you this watch, didn't he?

95
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:36,412
不关你事
None of your business.

96
00:10:43,253 --> 00:10:44,515
今天晚上的事
Only you and I...

97
00:10:45,554 --> 00:10:46,919
只有你和我知道
...know about tonight.

98
00:10:47,787 --> 00:10:49,084
我不想琛哥知道
I don't want Sam to know.

99
00:10:49,593 --> 00:10:51,219
为什么?
Why's that?

100
00:10:52,888 --> 00:10:54,617
做女人很简单
Women are simple.

101
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:59,420
只要男人好 我做什么都行
A man treats me well, I'd do anything.

102
00:11:01,623 --> 00:11:05,115
你先回去吧 我今天晚上会很忙
Now go home. I'm very busy tonight.

103
00:11:16,904 --> 00:11:22,073
没什么的 出来混 不是你扁我就是我扁你
It's either you or me.

104
00:11:22,074 --> 00:11:25,688
师傅说我今天有血光之灾 我知道
The boss predicted I would get hurt today.

105
00:11:26,162 --> 00:11:31,156
那又怎么样?表叔看得起我 老是问我
The Mainlander kept asking...

106
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,725
强哥 今天有没有奔驰啊?
"Got a Mercedes today, Keung?"

107
00:11:33,897 --> 00:11:35,831
我当然说有了 所以就出事了
I said, "Of course." And here I am!

108
00:11:36,765 --> 00:11:40,360
要不然 我用得着对着你?
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here with you .

109
00:11:40,432 --> 00:11:43,731
我啊 早就在中国城搂着妹妹 享受大餐了
Mainland girls in arms.

110
00:11:44,033 --> 00:11:45,967
还用说?
That's for sure!

111
00:11:51,301 --> 00:11:53,895
哎 来根烟抽抽啊
Hey, got a cigarette?

112
00:11:55,602 --> 00:11:56,694
我不抽烟的
I don't smoke.

113
00:12:11,805 --> 00:12:14,069
我看算了吧 我的车也没事
Let's forget about it. My car's fine.

114
00:12:14,372 --> 00:12:16,738
就是嘛 事主都说没事了
See! She says it's all good

115
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,540
没什么的 你看看你
Dressed all dandy.

116
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:24,208
穿的那么斯文 当然不想多事了
Don't want any trouble, do you?

117
00:12:24,707 --> 00:12:27,471
你看我 给你打的
Look at me. All beaten up by you.

118
00:12:27,808 --> 00:12:31,471
你说 到了法庭法官信谁?你自己想想
Who do you think the judge would believe?

119
00:12:32,275 --> 00:12:35,711
还有啊 你们不去尖东吗?
I bet you guys never go to Tsim Sha Tsui East, huh?

120
00:12:35,944 --> 00:12:38,172
你知道我是谁呀?我是傻强
Know who I am? I'm Keung!

121
00:12:38,173 --> 00:12:41,337
韩琛的头马 迪路的头马
Sam's top dog. Del Piero's boy.

122
00:12:41,611 --> 00:12:43,875
怎么样?当然见你一次打你一次
I'll kick your ass every time I see you.

123
00:12:43,876 --> 00:12:45,276
还用说?
And you can count on that.

124
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:06,843
诶
Hey,you .

125
00:13:07,217 --> 00:13:09,287
警官 我看叫救护车吧
How about calling an ambulance, sir?

126
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,483
你看 流血了都
Look at all the blood!

127
00:13:11,817 --> 00:13:14,081
叫他们多准备500毫升O型血 很难找的
Have them bring 500 cc Type O. It's rare!

128
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:15,476
O什么O?
Shut up!

129
00:13:15,751 --> 00:13:17,651
跟我回警局再慢慢解释
Wait till we're back to the station

130
00:13:18,058 --> 00:13:20,824
- 带走! - 喂 为什么要我去警局?
- Take him. - Why do I have to go to the station?

131
00:13:20,825 --> 00:13:23,660
喂 现在车又没丢 干么要我上警局?
I only stole a piece of junk, sir. What've I done to deserve the OCTB?

132
00:13:23,661 --> 00:13:26,511
- 闭嘴吧!还说! - 喂!跟你们回去 还不是让你们扁?
- Just shut up! - Does that deserve an OCTB beating?

133
00:13:26,653 --> 00:13:28,416
知不知道你只是个学警?
Don't you know you're just a cadet?

134
00:13:29,287 --> 00:13:31,414
还说今年想拿全班第一呢?
And you are expected to get a medal this year?

135
00:13:31,797 --> 00:13:33,924
别让叶长官知道
Don't ever let Yip know about this!

136
00:13:45,557 --> 00:13:46,785
叶长官 生日快乐
Happy birthday, Officer Yip.

137
00:13:47,124 --> 00:13:48,989
什么快乐?
What's there to be happy about?

138
00:13:49,592 --> 00:13:53,399
在警校蹲了十年 见树比见人还多
Ten years in the Academy. A rustic hell.

139
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,559
你都能把我弄出去
You even managed to get me out.

140
00:13:57,727 --> 00:13:59,456
你的案子已经隔了那么长时间
Your case is now ancient history.

141
00:13:59,727 --> 00:14:02,423
想一想 把自己也申调出去算了
Get yourself out.

142
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,211
虽然现在由华人担任处长
So what if the Commissioner is Chinese now?

143
00:14:07,212 --> 00:14:10,323
但要等老外都走了 还要六年
Still six more years till the hand-over.

144
00:14:10,662 --> 00:14:12,562
那时候我四十八了
I'll be 48 by then.

145
00:14:13,964 --> 00:14:18,867
不如在学校 多教几个好警察
Might as well train a few good cops here.

146
00:14:18,985 --> 00:14:21,756
九七后看你们的了
The world is yours after 1997!

147
00:14:23,866 --> 00:14:25,766
27149 干杯...
27149! Cheers!

148
00:14:26,221 --> 00:14:28,230
阿仁
Yan.

149
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,559
响了一整天了
Been beeping the whole day,

150
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,528
怎么不回电话?
How come you don't call back?

151
00:14:30,766 --> 00:14:31,824
女朋友?
Girlfriend?

152
00:14:32,968 --> 00:14:34,367
干杯 长官 干杯...
Cheers, sir!  Cheers!

153
00:14:35,034 --> 00:14:36,092
滚啊
Just leave me alone!

154
00:14:36,368 --> 00:14:37,528
不关我的事 我也不想知道
It's none of my business. I don't want to know a thing.

155
00:14:37,702 --> 00:14:39,033
滚!滚啊!
Go! Leave me alone!

156
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,037
罗继
Law.

157
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,137
你干什么?
What do you want?

158
00:14:49,804 --> 00:14:51,237
我爸爸刚去世
My father just passed way.

159
00:14:56,472 --> 00:14:58,201
他生前曾经吩咐过
It was his wish to inform his children...

160
00:14:59,472 --> 00:15:02,032
如果他出事的话 就要通知所有的子女
...when something bad happened to him.

161
00:15:04,974 --> 00:15:06,407
不好意思 打扰了
Sorry to have bothered you!

162
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:31,682
黑鬼 看什么电视 先吃饭吧
Stop watching TV! Eatfirst, Negro!

163
00:15:31,683 --> 00:15:36,049
坤叔走了 看电视台有什么消息
I wonder what they have on Kwun's death.

164
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,672
文拯 这事你干的?
Did you do it, Ching?

165
00:15:40,047 --> 00:15:41,878
我嘴巴大 要是我干的
I've got a big mouth. Had I done it...

166
00:15:42,115 --> 00:15:43,275
早就通天啦
...you would've heard about it!

167
00:15:43,515 --> 00:15:44,607
你问问国华 甘地
Ask Wah and Gandhi.

168
00:15:44,923 --> 00:15:48,490
哎 那就糟了 坤叔死的时候
When Kwun died, I was in Macau.

169
00:15:48,491 --> 00:15:50,782
我正在澳门谈生意
Everybody knows!

170
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,659
这回 他的子女一定算在我头上
But I bet his kids think I did it.

171
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,308
- 我甘地怕什么呀! - 就是
- I ain't scared of nothing - Right.

172
00:15:55,484 --> 00:15:57,952
大儿子当医生 小儿子游手好闲
The eldest son's a doctor. The youngest a brat.

173
00:15:58,252 --> 00:15:59,276
女儿嫁人了
The daughter's been married for ages.

174
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,612
只剩下二儿子看着他的生意
Only the middle son's running the show.

175
00:16:01,886 --> 00:16:06,255
如果他们太过份 我随时收拾他们
If they go too far, I'll show them!

176
00:16:06,419 --> 00:16:08,319
没保护好坤叔 是我们不好
We failed to protect Kwun. It's ourfault!

177
00:16:09,354 --> 00:16:11,286
三叔 算了
That's enough, Uncle John.

178
00:16:11,487 --> 00:16:13,045
爸爸常说
Dad used to say...

179
00:16:13,888 --> 00:16:16,220
"出来跑 迟早要还的"
"What goes around comes around."

180
00:16:17,256 --> 00:16:20,248
他现在才出事 算是赚了
It came later than expected already.

181
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:24,615
你们谁能猜到 国华 文拯...
Wah, Ching, Negro and Gandhi.

182
00:16:25,023 --> 00:16:28,642
黑鬼 甘地他们四个 现在想什么?
Guess what those four are thinking?

183
00:16:31,525 --> 00:16:33,425
麻烦你们 谢谢
Thank you . Thank you all.

184
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:39,485
姐 妈妈怎么样?没事吧?
How's mom doing, sis?

185
00:16:40,126 --> 00:16:42,151
没事 一早睡着了
She's fine. Been sleeping.

186
00:16:42,894 --> 00:16:46,416
她吩咐 买几包香烟送去殓房给爸爸
She wants us to bring some cigs to the morgue for Dad.

187
00:16:46,417 --> 00:16:48,050
我去买
I'll go get them.

188
00:16:54,963 --> 00:16:57,864
B组负责把守德诚街两边的街口
B Team, watch Tak Shing Street.

189
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,758
C组呢 把守财务公司那幢大厦
C Team, watch the Austin Road exit...

190
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,195
在柯士甸道这边的出入口
...of thatfinancial building

191
00:17:03,436 --> 00:17:04,733
这幢大厦有两个出入口
It has two exits

192
00:17:04,971 --> 00:17:06,666
一个在德诚街 一个在柯...
One on Tak Shing Street. One on Austin...

193
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:07,871
对不起
Sorry.

194
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,230
喂?
Hello?

195
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,695
倪坤死了这么大的事 你为什么不告诉我?
Why didn't you call me that Kwun was dead?

196
00:17:15,696 --> 00:17:18,859
一出事我就通知所有人了 大哥
I called everybody the minute it happened!

197
00:17:19,068 --> 00:17:20,899
倪坤一死 下面的肯定坐不住
Kwun's boys can't sit still for sure

198
00:17:21,135 --> 00:17:22,625
今晚尖沙嘴呀 准有事发生
Shit will hit the fan in Tsim Sha Tsui tonight.

199
00:17:22,935 --> 00:17:23,899
你不知道 今天十四号
<i>It's the 14th already. You know that?</i>

200
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,764
今天十四号 大家都要向倪家交钱
The 14th. Time to pay the Ngai Family

201
00:17:29,236 --> 00:17:31,670
这里我最小
I'm the junior partner here.

202
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,428
不好听的话我来说
So let me be the jackass.

203
00:17:34,238 --> 00:17:37,036
这个月起 我不再交钱给坤叔啦
I'm not paying the Ngai's anymore

204
00:17:38,238 --> 00:17:39,296
三位大哥的意思呢?
What do you three think?

205
00:17:50,078 --> 00:17:51,067
来 喝酒
Cheers.

206
00:18:32,983 --> 00:18:33,847
黄警官
Inspector Wong. 

207
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:34,739
怎么样?
What's up?

208
00:18:35,017 --> 00:18:36,245
你手下在国华楼下干什么呢?
<i>What are your men doing outside Wah's building?</i>

209
00:18:36,584 --> 00:18:37,573
啊 今天先不谈啊
Not a good time to chitchat.

210
00:18:37,918 --> 00:18:38,543
不要耍我啊!
<i>Are you up to something?</i> 

211
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:40,151
行... 改天再说啊
Fine, fine. Next time.

212
00:18:44,769 --> 00:18:46,647
哇 这么热闹?
What's the occasion?

213
00:18:48,053 --> 00:18:49,680
来... 给我个位子
Come on. Where's my seat?

214
00:18:55,988 --> 00:18:58,718
你要是来吃饭 我们会很高兴
Only if you 're here for the food. Then we're cool.

215
00:18:59,322 --> 00:19:01,222
其它的事 过了今晚再说
All other business will have to wait.

216
00:19:01,522 --> 00:19:03,490
吃东西呀!吃吧
The food. It's all about the food.

217
00:19:11,014 --> 00:19:13,350
今天晚上肯定不简单
Tonight's gonna be the shit.

218
00:19:14,825 --> 00:19:16,622
没办法 等他们四个老大办完事
Let the Big Four do their things

219
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:17,917
我们再收拾残局吧
We'll deal with the aftermath.

220
00:19:19,593 --> 00:19:21,083
这仗一打
Don't let them start fighting

221
00:19:21,459 --> 00:19:23,256
不知道死多少人
or you'll see bodies.

222
00:19:23,561 --> 00:19:25,153
怎么?不满意啊?
What? You don't dig it?

223
00:19:26,594 --> 00:19:29,688
照旧 抽牌决定
You know the rule. Pick a card.

224
00:19:30,228 --> 00:19:31,388
好呀 我们比大
Okay. Higher points win

225
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:32,595
来呀
Come on!

226
00:19:45,965 --> 00:19:49,559
没话好说啦!还找我干什么?
There's nothing left to talk about. What do you want from me?

227
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:52,260
怎么样 阿孝?
What's up, Hau?

228
00:19:52,732 --> 00:19:53,699
国华
Wah.

229
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:54,959
没什么
Nothing much.

230
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,566
我知道你最近在澳门谈赌场的生意
Heard you're planning a casino in Macau.

231
00:19:58,968 --> 00:20:00,833
政府方面我已经谈妥了
I've got the authorities in my pocket.

232
00:20:01,101 --> 00:20:02,762
看你有没有兴趣一起搞
How about a joint venture?

233
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:05,030
坤叔死了
Uncle Kwun's dead.

234
00:20:05,302 --> 00:20:06,462
我什么兴趣都没有
I'm not in the mood.

235
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,370
那倒是
I see.

236
00:20:13,437 --> 00:20:15,735
你到澳门不只是谈生意
The Macau trip wasn't all business.

237
00:20:17,204 --> 00:20:19,968
还跟甘地的老婆玩得挺开心
I know you had fun with Gandhi's wife.

238
00:20:46,623 --> 00:20:50,236
不好意思 我澳门的赌场不能放手
Sorry, but I can't let go of my casino in Macau.

239
00:20:50,378 --> 00:20:51,310
我先走了
Gotta go.

240
00:21:12,249 --> 00:21:13,841
韩琛那帮人在搞什么?
What are Sam's people doing?

241
00:21:15,016 --> 00:21:17,007
我知道国华已经交钱了
I know Wah paid up.

242
00:21:18,317 --> 00:21:19,579
你别把话岔开
Don't change the subject.

243
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,943
告诉我不知道的事 好不好?
Tell me something I don't know.

244
00:21:23,751 --> 00:21:25,218
好了 等你搞清楚再打给我
Call me when you get your shit straight!

245
00:21:27,241 --> 00:21:31,382
阿孝上去不到十分钟就搞定了国华
Hau took care of Wah in ten minutes.

246
00:21:31,653 --> 00:21:35,020
我看今晚那四个老大很难搞定他
The Big Four are having a tough time.

247
00:21:37,888 --> 00:21:40,254
我的线人说他拿了一百万毒品出来
Hau took out a million's worth of coke.

248
00:21:56,158 --> 00:21:57,125
干什么?
What?

249
00:21:57,692 --> 00:21:59,091
黑社会封路啊?
Mafia road block or what?

250
00:22:10,628 --> 00:22:13,460
倪先生 国华为何要交钱 我不知道
I don't know why Wah paid up, Hau.

251
00:22:13,461 --> 00:22:15,787
总之 我是没得商量
But I ain't gonna negotiate.

252
00:22:16,029 --> 00:22:17,291
我没打算跟你商量
I don't plan to negotiate with you, either. 

253
00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:18,553
你叫黑鬼听
Pass the phone to Negro.

254
00:22:20,096 --> 00:22:21,324
黑鬼
Hey, Negro.

255
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:24,490
我也不晓得他为什么在我地盘打电话给你
Don't know why he calls you from my hood.

256
00:22:27,465 --> 00:22:28,454
怎么样 阿孝?
What's up, Hau?

257
00:22:29,131 --> 00:22:31,292
甘地说的就等于是我说的
I'm with Gandhi all the way.

258
00:22:32,399 --> 00:22:35,391
他不交 我也不交了
He's not paying, neitherwill I!

259
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,133
不要紧 听说最近你跟甘地走得挺近
Heard you and Gandhi have been tight.

260
00:22:39,433 --> 00:22:43,164
还一起运了一批海洛因 但是被人劫走了
The heroin you two smuggled got robbed.

261
00:22:43,565 --> 00:22:45,533
每人损失了几百万 对吧?
Lost several millions each, right?

262
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:49,395
幸好 我在你的仓里捡回来
Luckily I found the stuff in your warehouse.

263
00:22:50,065 --> 00:22:51,930
要不要我现在交给甘地的小弟?
Want me to hand it back to Gandhi now?

264
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:57,309
喂 他说什么呀?
What's he talking about?

265
00:23:12,295 --> 00:23:13,922
尖沙嘴五帮人
Among the Tsim Sha Tsui Big Fives...

266
00:23:14,095 --> 00:23:17,030
国华 黑鬼都交钱了
Wah and Negro paid up.

267
00:23:17,928 --> 00:23:19,953
加上琛哥 三比二
Counting Sam, that's 3 to 2.

268
00:23:20,861 --> 00:23:22,988
这儿我最小 不交不行
I'm the junior partner here. Gotta pay!

269
00:23:24,961 --> 00:23:26,451
二位 告辞
See ya!

270
00:23:32,594 --> 00:23:34,721
别想那么多了 干杯
Don't think too much. Cheers!

271
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:44,490
给我把钱交了
Pay my share for me.

272
00:23:49,975 --> 00:23:52,773
黄警官 倪先生让我告诉你 他吃宵夜去了
Mr. Ngai went to get a quick bite, Inspector Wong.

273
00:24:28,803 --> 00:24:30,771
倪先生 这么晚才吃饭?
A bit late for chowing down, don't you think?

274
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,768
这么多年来 爸爸习惯了来这儿吃宵夜
My dad always came here after work.

275
00:24:36,236 --> 00:24:38,830
我今晚办完事 照例来光顾一下
I have to keep up the ritual.

276
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,768
怎么样 有没有兴趣?一起
Want to join us?

277
00:24:43,435 --> 00:24:45,699
看来这位子是你来坐了 辛苦了
It's your seat from now on. Must be tough.

278
00:24:46,768 --> 00:24:47,962
哪儿的话
Not at all.

279
00:24:49,002 --> 00:24:50,867
你们今晚劳师动众
You guys worked all night for nothing.

280
00:24:51,102 --> 00:24:53,570
但是一无收获 不是更辛苦?
Now that's tough.

281
00:24:55,234 --> 00:24:59,068
阿孝 你今天晚上表现真不错
Well done, Hau .

282
00:24:59,567 --> 00:25:01,159
我希望你一直这样
Hope you can keep it up.

283
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,362
我不想看到以后有什么事发生 走
Don't let it turn into a tragedy. Let's go.

284
00:25:04,733 --> 00:25:05,961
你不想什么?
What did you say?

285
00:25:09,332 --> 00:25:11,323
我们想开香槟庆祝
We want to celebrate.

286
00:25:11,666 --> 00:25:12,394
倪坤死了
Kwun's dead.

287
00:25:12,633 --> 00:25:14,430
我们想开香槟庆祝
Time to pop the champagne.

288
00:25:28,063 --> 00:25:29,724
要不要我给开一瓶啊?
Want me to pop one for you?

289
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,282
干什么?
What?

290
00:25:33,283 --> 00:25:36,184
想干警察?
Want to mess with cops?

291
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,586
哎!两位警官
Officers!

292
00:25:43,362 --> 00:25:44,954
今天倪家已经少了个人
The Ngai's are in mourning,

293
00:25:45,662 --> 00:25:46,959
还想怎么样?
What more do you want?

294
00:25:51,628 --> 00:25:53,220
走吧 走
Let's go. Let's go.

295
00:26:02,593 --> 00:26:03,423
琛哥
Sam.

296
00:26:07,493 --> 00:26:08,223
谢谢
Thanks.

297
00:26:20,825 --> 00:26:22,918
爸爸以前开小赌档
Dad used to operate street gambling here.

298
00:26:24,224 --> 00:26:26,192
从几毛钱小生意
Started out as...

299
00:26:27,258 --> 00:26:28,919
做到现在
a nickel-and-dime business.

300
00:26:30,357 --> 00:26:32,689
整个尖沙嘴没有人不认识他
Now who doesn't know his name in Tsim Sha Tsui?

301
00:26:43,655 --> 00:26:45,350
他常说出来跑...
He often said...

302
00:26:46,989 --> 00:26:48,547
迟早要还
"What goes around comes around."

303
00:26:49,921 --> 00:26:51,354
想不到今天...
And now he's...

304
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,888
我会永远记住今天
I'll always remember this day.

305
00:27:45,374 --> 00:27:46,314
喂
Hello?

306
00:27:46,315 --> 00:27:49,409
老婆 没事了 要不要宵夜?
<i>Hi. honey. It's all good. Want some snacks?</i>

307
00:27:49,781 --> 00:27:52,648
没事就好 我回家等你
Good to hear that. Just come home.

308
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:03,277
27149
27149.

309
00:28:03,813 --> 00:28:06,782
当警察的一定要身家清白
An officer has to have a clean background.

310
00:28:08,246 --> 00:28:11,773
虽然你跟母姓 多年来跟倪家没来往
Though you cut your ties with the Ngai's and changed your last name...

311
00:28:12,212 --> 00:28:15,010
但你和倪永孝到底是同一个父亲
...you still share the same father with Hau

312
00:28:15,478 --> 00:28:18,606
已经违反了虚报个人背景的校规
That means you lied on your application.

313
00:28:18,978 --> 00:28:20,605
我一定要开除你
I have to let you go.

314
00:28:21,677 --> 00:28:23,269
但你走之前
But before you leave...

315
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:26,607
你先见一见刚才穿错袜子的那个人
...go see "Mr. Wrong Socks" first

316
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,634
还想不想当警察?
Still want to be a cop?

317
00:28:38,476 --> 00:28:39,773
我还可以吗?
Can I still?

318
00:28:41,508 --> 00:28:43,408
只要你给我一个好的理由
Only if you can give me a good reason.

319
00:28:47,342 --> 00:28:48,775
我想做好人
I want to be a righteous person.

320
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:24,126
要当警察
If you want to be a cop...

321
00:29:24,371 --> 00:29:26,498
除了帮我 你没别的选择
...then lend me a hand. Simple as that

322
00:29:28,136 --> 00:29:30,297
你选我 是因为我是阿孝的弟弟?
You picked me 'cause I'm Hau 's brother, right?

323
00:29:32,603 --> 00:29:34,833
当有需要的时候 你会不会亲手捉他?
When the time comes, will you arrest him yourself?

324
00:29:36,869 --> 00:29:38,029
那我怎么开始?
How do I start?

325
00:29:40,869 --> 00:29:44,029
别吵 安静点
Shut up, Keep quiet

326
00:29:58,869 --> 00:30:00,529
你不认识我 在这儿
- You don't know me. - Over here!

327
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:04,227
揍他!
Get him!

328
00:30:07,237 --> 00:30:09,229
揍他
Get him! Get him!

329
00:30:09,532 --> 00:30:10,362
蹲下
Brace

330
00:30:10,532 --> 00:30:12,062
哎 长官 怎么样 赛果怎么样啊?
What's the score, Officer?

331
00:30:12,532 --> 00:30:13,262
别吵
Shut up.

332
00:30:17,532 --> 00:30:19,262
哎你看 傻强啊!
Any casualties?

333
00:30:31,597 --> 00:30:32,529
还好吗?
You okay?

334
00:30:38,696 --> 00:30:39,754
挺得住吗?
Hanging in there?

335
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:18,180
怎么样?
What's wrong?

336
00:31:18,757 --> 00:31:19,917
打得你很疼啊?
Does it still hurt?

337
00:31:21,124 --> 00:31:23,752
我老爸今天死了
My dad passed away today.

338
00:31:24,624 --> 00:31:26,785
他是最疼我的
He was so good to me.

339
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:29,583
我去求长官...
I asked the officer...

340
00:31:29,856 --> 00:31:34,190
问他能不能让我出去拜他
if I could go to his funeral.

341
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,917
长官就对我说...
The officer said...

342
00:31:37,456 --> 00:31:41,756
他说 "你知不知道什么叫坐牢?
"Know what it means to be a prisoner?

343
00:31:42,889 --> 00:31:47,087
"坐牢就是 就算你老爸死了
"It means you're not allowed

344
00:31:47,654 --> 00:31:50,214
"也不能让你出去拜的
"even to attend your father's funeral.

345
00:31:50,487 --> 00:31:52,284
你明不明白?"
Don't you know that?"

346
00:31:53,521 --> 00:31:55,045
走吧
Get out of here!

347
00:31:55,652 --> 00:32:08,643
哎 别这样 别哭了
Come on. Stop that

348
00:32:33,568 --> 00:32:35,934
(时间)
(Time)

349
00:32:36,934 --> 00:32:40,934
(1995年)
(Year: 1995)

350
00:33:07,346 --> 00:33:08,404
你有病?
Are you nuts?

351
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:10,908
你派阿仁去做卧底
You sent Yan to be a mole?

352
00:33:11,345 --> 00:33:12,972
你知不知道阿孝是他亲哥哥?
Don't you know Hau's his half-brother?

353
00:33:18,078 --> 00:33:19,067
那又怎么样?
So what?

354
00:33:21,811 --> 00:33:22,937
把他资料给我
Bring me his file!

355
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:31,510
你不是升了官就给我脸色看吧?
So you're playing the boss now, huh?

356
00:33:32,943 --> 00:33:36,470
你应该知道警队机密档案是不可以随便泄露
You damn well know the files are classified.

357
00:33:39,609 --> 00:33:42,601
我把你当兄弟 你跟我说这个?
I treat you like a bro. Is this what I get?

358
00:34:04,372 --> 00:34:06,237
你当我是兄弟就不要问
If you're a real bro, stop asking!

359
00:34:58,433 --> 00:34:59,730
没事吧
It's okay.

360
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:01,832
冷静点
Calm down.

361
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,724
慢慢说嘛
Don't lose your head.

362
00:35:04,133 --> 00:35:05,657
她把孩子打掉了
She had an abortion!

363
00:35:07,532 --> 00:35:10,524
那有什么 生孩子嘛
It's no big deal. Just a baby.

364
00:35:10,765 --> 00:35:14,098
打掉了再生一个嘛 就是这样的 有什么呢!
You can always have another one! That's life!

365
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:20,493
我和你一起四年了
I've been with you for four years.

366
00:35:21,463 --> 00:35:23,931
去警局保你也有十几次
And I've bailed you out tons of times.

367
00:35:25,063 --> 00:35:26,758
跟我家人吃顿饭...
One minute we're dining with my folks...

368
00:35:26,996 --> 00:35:29,795
都可以突然跑去砍人
...the next you'll be in a gang fight

369
00:35:29,796 --> 00:35:32,128
我不想孩子将来也是这样
I don't want our baby to grow up like you.

370
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,161
你明不明白?
Don't you understand?

371
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:04,326
见到我这么拘谨?
Why so uptight?

372
00:36:05,525 --> 00:36:06,321
没有
No, nothing.

373
00:36:08,092 --> 00:36:09,753
听三叔说 你干得不错
Uncle John says you're doing well.

374
00:36:12,192 --> 00:36:13,955
有没有想过回家里来帮忙?
Ever thought about helping the family out?

375
00:36:17,624 --> 00:36:20,491
我知道你不想让人知道 你跟倪家的关系
I know you want to keep a distance from the Ngai's

376
00:36:22,757 --> 00:36:25,351
但我们是亲兄弟 这是事实 没的改变
But we're blood brothers. It's a fact.

377
00:36:26,057 --> 00:36:27,051
对吧
Right?

378
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:32,087
这个星期天我女儿生日
It's my daughter's birthday this Sunday. 

379
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,848
我想你回家坐一坐
You're invited.

380
00:36:36,289 --> 00:36:37,984
你真的不喜欢跟我说话?
You really hate talking to me, huh?

381
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:39,810
不是
No.

382
00:36:41,821 --> 00:36:42,810
不是
No

383
00:36:55,053 --> 00:36:58,682
没多久就升职 很快就升警司了?
Promoted already? Soon you'll be a superintendent.

384
00:36:59,653 --> 00:37:01,382
你全职当警察好了
Might as well become a full-time cop.

385
00:37:04,818 --> 00:37:07,013
琛哥跟你开玩笑呢 快笑一笑
Sam's kidding. Go ahead, give me a smile.

386
00:37:10,318 --> 00:37:12,878
这两年全靠琛哥给我情报
Thanks for your intel these couple years.

387
00:37:13,817 --> 00:37:15,492
以前你是小角色 叫你抓些小鱼小虾米
When you were still a rookie,

388
00:37:15,493 --> 00:37:19,883
顺便帮我扫扫那些牛鬼蛇神
I helped you catch some small potatoes.

389
00:37:19,884 --> 00:37:22,944
现在你升了职 要抓就要抓些高级的喽
It's about time you caught some big shots.

390
00:37:23,317 --> 00:37:24,443
干脆你来抓我好喽
How about catching me?

391
00:37:25,616 --> 00:37:27,880
哇 怎么这么脏啊你?要不就抓个美女
Isn't that cute? Or you can catch hot chicks.

392
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:29,414
哎呀!要死
What are you doing?!

393
00:37:30,183 --> 00:37:32,030
哪有这么漂亮的女人?
What a hot hootchie mama!

394
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:34,584
你男人一定很帅的 不然怎么配得上你?
Your man must be one good-looking bastard.

395
00:37:34,982 --> 00:37:36,381
那不就是你嘛
It's you! Who else?

396
00:37:38,282 --> 00:37:39,544
- 走了! - 又走?
- Gotta go. - Already?

397
00:37:39,782 --> 00:37:41,909
约了倪先生 要干活嘛!
Gotta go meet Mr. Ngai.

398
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,405
琛哥...对你真好
Sam's so good to you .

399
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,706
可惜他对自己不好
But he's not good to himself.

400
00:38:06,312 --> 00:38:07,438
四年了
It's been four years.

401
00:38:09,179 --> 00:38:11,170
本来他可以做老大
He could be in charge now.

402
00:38:13,112 --> 00:38:15,171
但是他全都给了姓倪的
But he gave everything to the Ngai's.

403
00:38:18,111 --> 00:38:20,045
现在没人敢碰姓倪的
Now the Ngai Family's all big and bad

404
00:38:21,677 --> 00:38:24,737
那件事 阿孝一定找人算账
Hau must've figured it out.

405
00:38:26,177 --> 00:38:27,371
这四年来
For the past four years, 

406
00:38:29,076 --> 00:38:30,338
我一直都睡不好
I haven't been sleeping well.

407
00:38:31,943 --> 00:38:33,137
我是黄志诚总督察
<i>Hello. I' m Inspector Wong Chi-Shing.</i>

408
00:38:33,476 --> 00:38:35,517
放心吧 玛莉姐
Don't worry, Mary.

409
00:38:35,909 --> 00:38:37,274
我不会让你出事的
I won't let anything happen to you .

410
00:38:39,742 --> 00:38:41,141
你说话要算话哦
Words, words, words.

411
00:38:43,141 --> 00:38:44,301
一定
I promise.

412
00:39:21,349 --> 00:39:23,544
扔个球来看看
Toss it up.

413
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:35,164
前两天 有个地产经纪来看房子
Two days ago, a real estate agent came.

414
00:39:35,902 --> 00:39:37,597
你们猜他开什么价?
Guess how much he offered?

415
00:39:37,968 --> 00:39:41,301
一亿六 一亿六千万
160 million. 160 million!

416
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:43,433
你们说香港搞什么?
What's wrong with Hong Kong? Tell me!

417
00:39:44,067 --> 00:39:46,160
我记得爸爸买这儿的时候是...
When my dad bought it,

418
00:39:46,568 --> 00:39:49,867
九百...二十八万
it was 9 million...280 thousand.

419
00:39:50,267 --> 00:39:51,700
现在这什么世界?
What a world!

420
00:39:51,934 --> 00:39:53,196
倪先生 要换房子吗?
Trading up, Mr. Ngai?

421
00:39:54,066 --> 00:39:57,126
没什么 九七了 移民
1997 is approaching. Time to emigrate.

422
00:39:58,399 --> 00:39:59,229
那有什么大不了的?
No big deal. 

423
00:39:59,533 --> 00:40:01,467
现在一切都很方便
Communication's easy these days.

424
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,834
有事打个电话回来就行了
We're just a phone call away.

425
00:40:04,005 --> 00:40:06,473
我也是这么想 但是又怕交不起电话费
I'm just worried about the phone bill.

426
00:40:07,314 --> 00:40:10,147
你们知道 电话公司都狠的
The phone company's greedy, you know.

427
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,756
其实我和妈妈商量过
I've discussed it with Mom.

428
00:40:13,998 --> 00:40:17,593
现在我们倪家的生意 都已经上了轨道
Our businesses are on the right track.

429
00:40:18,477 --> 00:40:21,878
你们也帮我们打理生意不少日子了
You guys helped out so much in the past.

430
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:25,387
我们不想让人觉得我们打完了斋不要和尚
I don't want to be ungrateful.

431
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:28,394
所以打算走了以后 把这盘生意...
I want to split the business up...

432
00:40:28,806 --> 00:40:30,330
全分给你们几位
...among you guys

433
00:40:30,577 --> 00:40:34,980
当是感谢也好 公积金也好 对吧
Treat it as a gift or a retirement fund.

434
00:40:38,565 --> 00:40:40,897
吃啊 喜欢吃什么就拿什么
Let's eat! Take whatever you want!

435
00:40:41,707 --> 00:40:45,643
以后大家有空多聚聚 就像今天这样 挺好
We should hang out like this more often.

436
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,098
倪先生
Mr. Ngai.

437
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,092
你真要走?
Are you leaving for real?

438
00:41:01,135 --> 00:41:02,466
你走了会乱的
After you're gone, hell will break loose!

439
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:04,962
阿琛 你信佛的吧?
You're a Buddhist, aren't you, Sam?

440
00:41:07,135 --> 00:41:09,000
"拿起容易 放下难"
"Easy to start. Hard to let go."

441
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:13,069
我今天放得下 你该替我高兴
I'm letting go. Be happy for me.

442
00:41:15,802 --> 00:41:17,565
我替你想过
I've thought about it.

443
00:41:18,568 --> 00:41:20,729
以后一定是可卡因的世界
Cocaine will be the future.

444
00:41:21,835 --> 00:41:24,770
他们四个从南美一小包一小包的运过来
Those four ship it in small bags from South America.

445
00:41:25,069 --> 00:41:26,559
成不了什么气候
Small-timers!

446
00:41:28,136 --> 00:41:30,536
我和泰国那边呢 已经谈好了
I've closed a deal with the Thais.

447
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:32,431
以后让你独家进口
You'll have a monopoly.

448
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:35,630
到时候你是大庄家 谁都听你的
You 'll be the top dog. Leader of the pack.

449
00:41:37,404 --> 00:41:41,067
过两天你去泰国办好了事情 就可以回来开始
Go to Thailand and wrap up the logistics.

450
00:41:53,271 --> 00:41:54,795
你打算收拾他们四个?
You plan to get rid of those four?

451
00:42:14,939 --> 00:42:16,600
右边的靠近一点啊
Move closer to the center, please.

452
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,272
永仁
Yan.

453
00:42:18,906 --> 00:42:19,668
过来一家人拍张照
Come join the family portrait.

454
00:42:24,274 --> 00:42:25,468
来...站这儿
Stand next to me!

455
00:42:27,721 --> 00:42:32,273
好 看镜头 一 二 三
One more shot. Okay. One, two, three.

456
00:42:32,274 --> 00:42:33,468
好 再来一张
One more!

457
00:42:33,608 --> 00:42:35,508
其实这两年我很少留在香港
I haven't been around much these past two years.

458
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:36,707
所以今天...
So today...

459
00:42:36,974 --> 00:42:40,432
难得一家人...共聚天伦
...It's rare to spend time...with the whole family like this

460
00:42:41,574 --> 00:42:45,305
姐姐 哥哥和弟弟都做了正行
Your siblings are in legitimate businesses.

461
00:42:47,342 --> 00:42:49,469
所以觉得你应该回家帮忙
It's time you helped out the family.

462
00:42:50,275 --> 00:42:52,607
以前爸爸做每件事都是为了这个家
Everything Dad did was for the family.

463
00:42:53,342 --> 00:42:54,400
我也是
I did the same.

464
00:42:55,008 --> 00:42:56,339
我希望你也是
Hope you will, too.

465
00:43:03,009 --> 00:43:06,342
下个星期有笔买卖 我想你跟我一起去
A deal's coming up next week. Come with me.

466
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:10,941
到时候我找你
I'll call you.

467
00:43:39,578 --> 00:43:42,376
这个交易很重要 所以他要亲自去
I think he's taking the deal seriously.

468
00:43:42,712 --> 00:43:44,873
日期下个礼拜三 十四号
He'll go in person next Wednesday.

469
00:43:46,246 --> 00:43:49,374
十四号 倪坤的死忌
The 14th... Kwun's memorial.

470
00:43:49,579 --> 00:43:51,103
他想收拾那四个老大
Hau wants to whack the Big Four.

471
00:43:53,813 --> 00:43:55,804
你知道他为什么把韩琛支开?
Why does he send Sam away?

472
00:43:57,713 --> 00:44:00,739
不知道 便是韩琛应该能帮他的忙
Don't know. Sam should be of help to him.

473
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,575
他连韩琛也想除掉
Unless he wants to kill Sam also!

474
00:44:20,481 --> 00:44:21,675
我跟了你好几天了
I've been following you around for days.

475
00:44:24,315 --> 00:44:26,408
不管怎么说 我也是你们上司
I'm your superior after all

476
00:44:26,882 --> 00:44:28,611
我想知道你们下一步想干什么
I want to know what your plan is

477
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:37,543
姓倪的是你的家人
The Ngai's are your family

478
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:39,446
你知道现在你在做什么吗?
Do you really know what you're doing?

479
00:44:45,583 --> 00:44:46,550
长官
Sir!

480
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:49,278
我是警察
I'm a cop!

481
00:44:53,117 --> 00:44:53,947
好
Good.

482
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:55,507
敬个礼给我看看
Give me a salute.

483
00:45:00,984 --> 00:45:03,680
订了位子跟你吃饭 一会儿有空?
I've booked a table. Care for dinner?

484
00:45:07,985 --> 00:45:09,009
我戴帽子好看吗?
Do I look cool in my cap?

485
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:22,509
傻强
Keung.

486
00:45:25,886 --> 00:45:26,853
怎么样
Looking good?

487
00:45:28,686 --> 00:45:31,211
穿成这样 到泰国搞什么?
What'll you do in Thailand in that outfit?

488
00:45:31,886 --> 00:45:32,978
不搞什么
Have some shark fin soup.

489
00:45:33,353 --> 00:45:35,787
吃鱼翅 按摩 再来个一王二后
A massage. Get two whores for a threesome.

490
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:36,909
还用说?
That's for sure.

491
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:41,351
老公
Honey!

492
00:45:41,587 --> 00:45:42,519
怎么样?
<i>What?</i>

493
00:45:42,754 --> 00:45:44,415
去泰国怎么不告诉我呢?
Why didn't you tell me about your trip?

494
00:45:44,654 --> 00:45:46,451
去办事嘛 你以为打泰拳啊?
It's a business trip! Not for fun!

495
00:45:46,854 --> 00:45:48,947
放心吧 不会乱搞 啊!
Don't worry. I'll behave.

496
00:45:49,654 --> 00:45:51,781
倪永孝要收拾国华他们
<i>Hau plans to whack Wah and those guys.</i>

497
00:45:53,555 --> 00:45:54,522
我知道
I know.

498
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:57,384
那你知不知道他也想干掉你?
But did you know you 're his target too?

499
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:01,189
别听人乱说 怎么会呢?
Nonsense! How can that be?

500
00:46:01,622 --> 00:46:04,284
总之你别管 在机场等我 就这样
Just wait for me at the airport!

501
00:46:06,588 --> 00:46:07,748
琛哥 该登机了
Time to board, Sam!

502
00:46:28,124 --> 00:46:29,648
我能做的就这么多
That's all I can do for now.

503
00:46:31,657 --> 00:46:33,454
等阿琛下飞机再打给他
Call Sam again when the plane lands.

504
00:46:37,858 --> 00:46:39,587
我今天晚上就要杀了阿孝
I'm going to kill Hau tonight.

505
00:46:40,491 --> 00:46:41,753
你别乱来
Don't do anything rash.

506
00:46:42,625 --> 00:46:43,922
我不是乱来
I'm not being rash.

507
00:46:47,726 --> 00:46:49,523
我只记得四年前
Four years ago...

508
00:46:50,726 --> 00:46:52,489
是你叫我杀掉倪坤的
...you told me to kill Kwun.

509
00:47:01,859 --> 00:47:03,827
你什么意思?要挟我?
So what? Want to blackmail me now?

510
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:05,118
我不是要挟你
I'm not blackmailing you .

511
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:10,286
而是我们两个现在 都不能回头了
We simply passed the point of no return!

512
00:47:34,462 --> 00:47:35,827
到时候我调走所有人
I'll send everybody away then.

513
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:47,992
今天晚上的行动要绝对保密
Tonight's operation's top secret

514
00:47:48,596 --> 00:47:49,722
我们分三个组
We're divided into three teams.

515
00:47:51,396 --> 00:47:53,990
A组 把住这个出口
Team A watches here.

516
00:47:54,197 --> 00:47:55,164
B组 这个出口
Team B here.

517
00:47:55,397 --> 00:47:57,388
没我的命令不准行动
Wait for my order before doing anything.

518
00:47:58,364 --> 00:48:00,924
C组一直跟着目标人物 直到...
Team C follows the target until...

519
00:48:03,497 --> 00:48:04,896
改了日期不通知我?
Nobody told me about the date change!

520
00:48:07,197 --> 00:48:10,496
我早就说过 阿孝这个人很难捉摸
You know Hau changes his mind all the time.

521
00:48:13,697 --> 00:48:16,063
你以为只有你在他身边有人?
You think Yan's the only mole?

522
00:48:16,365 --> 00:48:18,162
我那个卧底跟着他七年了
My man's been undercover for seven years!

523
00:48:19,832 --> 00:48:20,764
那副牌呢?
Where's the deck of cards?

524
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:37,590
今天晚上 我们一起决定
It's a tie. We'll run the show together tonight. Deal?

525
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:41,666
出发
Let's go!

526
00:50:51,777 --> 00:50:52,675

528
00:51:09,945 --> 00:51:12,106
别动...都站好
Freeze! Freeze! Hold it right there!

529
00:52:14,152 --> 00:52:15,141
阿孝
What's up, Hau?

530
00:52:15,784 --> 00:52:18,014
你非要等律师来才开口?
Zipping it till your lawyer gets here?

531
00:52:19,251 --> 00:52:20,513
合作点吧
Come on, cooperate with us!

532
00:52:21,685 --> 00:52:25,246
别这么说 我谢谢你合作才对
In fact, I appreciate your cooperation.

533
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:27,814
倪先生 你说话这么深奥
Are you speaking Zen, Mr. Ngai?

534
00:52:28,086 --> 00:52:29,075
没人明白的
I don't get it.

535
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:34,209
爸爸常说
Dad used to say...

536
00:52:35,686 --> 00:52:39,281
出来跑 无论做过什么...
... the way things work in the streets...

537
00:52:39,954 --> 00:52:41,216
迟早要还
... what goes around always comes around.

538
00:52:43,854 --> 00:52:46,755
他死了四年 今天是时候了
He died four years ago. It's about time.

539
00:52:57,155 --> 00:52:58,315
老板 可以了
The stove's hot enough now.

540
00:52:59,155 --> 00:53:00,015
放下吧

541
00:53:15,057 --> 00:53:16,354

过来呀
Come here

543
00:53:55,595 --> 00:53:56,056
师兄 走了
partner,I'm going.

544
00:53:59,195 --> 00:54:00,856
你人在这儿
<i>You 're here now.</i>

545
00:54:01,428 --> 00:54:02,918
还能出什么花样?
<i>What can you swing?</i>

546
00:54:03,527 --> 00:54:04,551
别着急 等着瞧
<i>Wait and see</i>

547
00:54:06,494 --> 00:54:07,552
长官 查到了
Got it! Sir

548
00:54:07,829 --> 00:54:09,387
那两个老外是私家侦探
the two foreigners are private eyes.

549
00:55:20,202 --> 00:55:23,569
喂 老公 你在哪里?
Honey! Where are you?

550
00:55:23,968 --> 00:55:25,026
我在泰国的嘛
Thailand, of course.

551
00:55:25,634 --> 00:55:26,828
你快点回来
<i>Come back right away!</i>

552
00:55:27,368 --> 00:55:28,835
神经病!我回来干什么?
Are you nuts? Why should I come back?

553
00:55:29,068 --> 00:55:30,968
你别管那么多 你快点回来
Don't ask questions! Just come back!

554
00:55:31,602 --> 00:55:32,933
阿孝要找人杀你
Hau wants you dead!

555
00:55:33,268 --> 00:55:35,202
胡说 我正帮他做事啊
Nonsense! I'm working for him as we speak!

556
00:55:36,036 --> 00:55:37,196
你听我说
Listen to me!

557
00:55:39,236 --> 00:55:42,069
倪坤...是我杀的
I'm the one who killed Kwun.

558
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:54,162
有没有录象机?
You've got a VCR?

559
00:55:59,805 --> 00:56:00,533
好看吗?
Isn't it good?

倪先生他让我好好的招待你
Mr. Ngai told me to take good care of you!

565

是你叫我杀掉倪坤的
<i>...you told me to kill Kwun .</i>

567
00:58:22,217 --> 00:58:24,344
你什么意思?要挟我?
<i>So what? Want to blackmail me now?</i>

568
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:25,881
我不是要挟你

569
00:58:27,717 --> 00:58:30,845
而是我们现两个现在 都不能回头了
<i>We simply passed the point of no return</i>

570
00:58:34,118 --> 00:58:35,915
到时候我调走所有人

573
00:58:57,587 --> 00:59:00,021

574
00:59:00,488 --> 00:59:01,978
知法犯法

你们收了韩琛的女人多少钱?

584
01:01:24,768 --> 01:01:26,736
倪先生 给次机会吧
Give me another chance, Mr. Ngai.

585
01:01:59,927 --> 01:02:02,589
四年前 我给过他们机会

586
01:02:02,647 --> 01:02:04,556
他们没要
They didn't take it.

587
01:02:07,192 --> 01:02:09,422
如果今天我给你机会
If I give you a chance...

588

你要不要?
Are you going to take it today?

589

你来了我们倪家七年

你是警察
You're a cop.

591
01:02:36,185 --> 01:02:37,948
我们是黑社会
We're the bad guys.

592
01:02:38,693 --> 01:02:40,275
所以各安天命
Time to accept our fates.

593

你不要怪我
You can't blame me.

594
01:02:48,183 --> 01:02:51,550
因为你们的黄长官杀了我爸爸

我为什么要帮你?
Why should I?

609
01:06:56,727 --> 01:06:58,695
因为我帮你除掉你老大

616

来抓我?
Are you here to arrest me?

618
01:09:20,612 --> 01:09:22,273
你现在要去杀阿孝

619

那就是没商量了
Then there's nothing to talk about.

全警局的人都支持你

01:19:34,147 --> 01:19:35,739
你为什么会变成这样?
What happened to you?

701
01:19:38,458 --> 01:19:39,925
如果我告诉你
If I told you...

702
01:19:40,263 --> 01:19:43,255
这些所谓的证据全都不成立
...that the evidence couldn't stand...

703
01:19:45,009 --> 01:19:46,408
你想不想重新再来?
...would you like to start over?

704
01:19:49,622 --> 01:19:52,819
对不起 我犯了法
I'm sorry. I broke the law.

705
01:19:53,466 --> 01:19:56,526
你对九七以后警队的士气有什么看法?
What do you think of the police force's morale after 1997?

706
01:19:57,210 --> 01:19:59,201
中国人注重感情
Chinese people are sentimental

707
01:19:59,482 --> 01:20:01,575
我也希望法律能继续支持我
I hope the law will continue to back me up

708
01:20:01,889 --> 01:20:05,916
但是 我同样坚信自己的能力 长官
But, I strongly believe in myself, sir!

709
01:20:06,569 --> 01:20:08,400
各位怎样对我 我知道
I'm grateful to all of you.

710
01:20:10,111 --> 01:20:13,205
但我没有信心 我已经输了
But I've got no confidence left. I lost!

711
01:20:13,521 --> 01:20:14,818
那阿昌又怎样?
What about Luk then?

712
01:20:16,027 --> 01:20:18,222
你觉得现在这么做 对得起阿昌吗?
Can you face him if you give up now?

713
01:20:19,437 --> 01:20:22,406
阿黄 这场仗还没打完
The war's not over.

714
01:20:23,949 --> 01:20:27,749
我们每个人 都希望对这件事有个交待
We all want a closure to this incident.

715
01:20:29,598 --> 01:20:33,625
我们想外面知道 香港不是由姓倪的来管
Hong Kong is not run by the Ngai Family.

716
01:20:39,625 --> 01:20:41,650
这里有一份国际刑警档案
Here's a file from the Interpol.

717
01:20:42,165 --> 01:20:43,427
你看完了再作决定
Read it before your make up your mind.

718
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,490
有没有参加过泰国的丧礼?
Ever been to a funeral in Thailand?

719
01:21:10,901 --> 01:21:12,334
几个月前
A few months ago...

720
01:21:13,268 --> 01:21:14,860
我为老婆办了一个
I had one for my wife.

721
01:21:16,867 --> 01:21:21,031
请了些大师 给她念了三天的经
The monks chanted for three full days.

722
01:21:24,335 --> 01:21:28,237
这三天 我没流过一滴眼泪
During those three days, I didn't shed a single tear.

723
01:21:31,570 --> 01:21:33,265
没想到出殡那天
On the day of the burial...

724
01:21:35,204 --> 01:21:39,368
那些苦力 把棺材抬到厅里
...they left the casket in the living room.

725
01:21:41,071 --> 01:21:42,299
当时我很生气
I was mad.

726
01:21:43,072 --> 01:21:44,471
很想打人
I wanted to beat them up.

727
01:21:46,706 --> 01:21:48,571
但大师就对我说
The monk told me...

728
01:21:51,173 --> 01:21:53,004
这是他们的习俗
...it's a tradition in Thailand.

729
01:21:55,339 --> 01:21:56,772
死的人
The deceased...

730
01:21:58,074 --> 01:21:59,871
只要我们能够陪她
...as long as we keep her company...

731
01:22:00,907 --> 01:22:02,841
过一段时间
...for a little while longer...

732
01:22:04,708 --> 01:22:06,699
她就可以安息了
...she can attain eternal peace.

733
01:22:11,575 --> 01:22:12,974
但是我对大师说
But I asked the monk...

734
01:22:16,576 --> 01:22:18,976
我老婆不在棺材里
...what if my wife was not in the coffin?

735
01:22:20,910 --> 01:22:22,571
她可不可以安息呀?
Could she still attain eternal peace?

736
01:22:30,278 --> 01:22:32,644
嫂子的事 对不起
Sorry about your wife.

737
01:22:39,579 --> 01:22:41,809
大师马上按住我这里
The monk placed his hand here.

738
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:45,610
他说 "没问题
He said, "No problem,

739
01:22:47,780 --> 01:22:50,214
你太太在你这儿就行喽"
Your wife's here."

740
01:22:56,315 --> 01:22:58,112
而碰巧这里
And here's exactly...

741
01:23:00,716 --> 01:23:03,276
就是泰国人打我一枪的地方
...where the Thais shot me!

742
01:23:07,583 --> 01:23:09,517
我立刻对自己说
So I told myself,

743
01:23:15,951 --> 01:23:18,112
我是不可能再回头了
I've passed the point of no return.

744
01:23:23,218 --> 01:23:27,518
这次回香港指证倪永孝 很危险
Testifying against Hau in Hong Kong could be dangerous.

745
01:23:32,352 --> 01:23:35,185
你这么帅 我有信心
I believe in you . You 're so handsome.

746
01:23:39,154 --> 01:23:41,884
很久没人跟我说这句话了 谢谢
Haven't heard that for ages. Thanks.

747
01:23:45,121 --> 01:23:46,179
你有什么打算?
What's your plan?

748
01:23:49,389 --> 01:23:50,788
尽力而为吧
Just trying to do my best.

749
01:23:51,556 --> 01:23:53,421
没什么 工作嘛
No big deal. It's my job.

750
01:23:55,256 --> 01:23:58,191
搞定这件事之后 我会离开香港
I'll leave Hong Kong when it's all over.

751
01:24:06,556 --> 01:24:08,475
阿黄
Hey,you!

752
01:24:26,894 --> 01:24:28,054
你变了
You've changed.

753
01:24:33,762 --> 01:24:34,786
宝宝
Baby!

754
01:25:21,317 --> 01:25:22,716
货里掺东西了?
You diluted the coke, didn't you?

755
01:25:26,352 --> 01:25:27,580
没话说了?
Got anything to say?

756
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:43,446
全给我吸了它
Take it all then.

757
01:25:49,255 --> 01:25:51,416
阿仁 别那么绝
Don't go too far, Yan.

758
01:25:51,689 --> 01:25:53,657
让小的看见 哪有心情做事啊?
It'd break the boys' morale.

759
01:25:57,556 --> 01:25:59,581
倪先生叫我这么做的
Mr. Ngai asked me to be in charge here.

760
01:26:01,157 --> 01:26:03,352
不喜欢就送他上医院
Don't like it? Drive him to the hospital!

761
01:26:18,893 --> 01:26:20,383
无论他们做错什么
No matter what,

762
01:26:20,626 --> 01:26:22,059
他们始终是长辈
they're elders after all.

763
01:26:23,627 --> 01:26:25,686
你以后还有很多东西要跟他们学
You 've got lots to learn from them.

764
01:26:27,994 --> 01:26:30,758
三叔再做几年就退休了
Uncle John will retire in a few years.

765
01:26:33,561 --> 01:26:34,755
你明白我的意思吧?
You know what I mean?

766
01:26:36,828 --> 01:26:39,762
我不想在这个时候 有什么事情发生
I don't need any hiccups now.

767
01:26:42,662 --> 01:26:45,688
今晚劳工体育会请吃回归宴
The Labor Athletic Association is hosting a dinner reception...

768
01:26:46,563 --> 01:26:49,123
我们所有的政协候选人都会去
...for us Political Consultative candidates.

769
01:26:50,431 --> 01:26:52,228
如果这次我成功
If everything works out,

770
01:26:53,497 --> 01:26:55,658
我们倪家以后就能抬起头来做人
our family will no longer live in the shadows.

771
01:27:23,168 --> 01:27:24,066

我听洪大律师提起过你呀
When Solicitor Hung mentioned you,

775
01:27:29,568 --> 01:27:30,933
我还不大相信呢
I didn't believe him.

776
01:27:31,803 --> 01:27:34,636
倪先生 你看看你 你真是年青有为啊
You 're amazingly young, Mr. Ngai.

777
01:27:34,969 --> 01:27:35,731

785
01:28:01,007 --> 01:28:02,406
对了 梁长官

现在怀疑你

和一九九五年多宗谋杀案有关

810
01:29:20,150 --> 01:29:22,584
不过 身为三合会的龙头

811

所有人都知道 韩琛对倪家忠心耿耿
Everyone knows how loyal Sam was to you.

821

Now he's a prosecution witness. It's over.

822
01:29:52,922 --> 01:29:54,389

826
01:30:01,523 --> 01:30:02,683
你要我怎么办?
What can I do?

827
01:30:02,856 --> 01:30:03,788
恐吓中国政府啊?
Threaten the Chinese government?

828
01:30:04,023 --> 01:30:05,354
他不是这个意思
Don't take it the wrong way.

829
01:30:05,723 --> 01:30:07,554
只不过大家同坐一条船
We're all in the same boat.

830
01:30:07,924 --> 01:30:09,050
那我下船了

831
01:30:10,025 --> 01:30:12,323
我是你们的律师 不是你们的人
I'm just a lawyer. Not one of you.

832
01:30:12,925 --> 01:30:16,051
我不想跟你们沉船 对不起
I don't intend to sink with you . Sorry.

833
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:27,984

834
01:30:29,227 --> 01:30:31,787
查到韩琛有个老婆和女儿在泰国

835

Okay. Haven't been there for a while.

841
01:31:04,998 --> 01:31:06,363
你会不会有事?
Are you going to be all right?

842
01:31:06,599 --> 01:31:07,930
没事...
I'll be fine.

843
01:31:09,132 --> 01:31:11,225
对不起 我帮不上家里什么忙
Sorry I can't help the family.

844
01:31:11,732 --> 01:31:12,630
最要紧你没事
The key thing now is you turn out okay.

845
01:31:12,866 --> 01:31:14,197
别这么说 一家人嘛
Don't be silly. We're a family.

846
01:31:15,233 --> 01:31:16,666
照顾妈妈
Take care of mom!

847
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:19,034
放心 交给我们三个
Don't worry. Leave it to us three.

848
01:31:30,686 --> 01:31:33,746
我总觉得 就算我出庭作证
Even with my testimony,

849
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:38,615
阿孝顶多坐几年牢而已
Hau will only get a couple years.

850
01:31:39,434 --> 01:31:40,934
那倒是
It's true.

851
01:31:40,935 --> 01:31:44,751
如果要他终身监禁 除非他杀了你
He'll have to whack you to get life.

852
01:31:48,935 --> 01:31:49,763
- 我走了 - 阿黄
- I Gotta go - Hey, you

853
01:31:52,105 --> 01:31:54,237
这次真的谢谢你
I have to thank you.

854
01:31:54,238 --> 01:31:55,708
没有你
Without you

855
01:31:56,042 --> 01:31:57,441
我也回不了香港
I could never have come back to Hong Kong.

856
01:32:00,907 --> 01:32:03,374
不跟你说了 我最近很忙
Save it! I'm busy these days.

857
01:32:03,375 --> 01:32:05,941
你有什么需要 就跟他们说
Anything you need, ask them.

858
01:32:05,942 --> 01:32:08,069
这组人负责保护你
They'll protect you.

859
01:32:08,106 --> 01:32:09,403
行!
I know.

860
01:32:24,847 --> 01:32:26,896
琛哥
Sam.

861
01:32:29,549 --> 01:32:31,762
谢谢
Thanks.

862
01:32:33,550 --> 01:32:36,049
怎么样 好吗?
So, how's it going?

863
01:32:36,050 --> 01:32:39,551
还好 调到刑事情报科
Good. Been transferred to the ClB.

864
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:42,556
下个月升做见习督察
I'll be an Inspector-in-Training next month.

865
01:32:47,987 --> 01:32:50,381
玛莉姐走的时候
Did Mary call you...

866
01:32:50,855 --> 01:32:53,476
有没有找过你?
...before she left?

867
01:33:00,524 --> 01:33:04,213
琛哥 节哀顺变
Don't be too hard on yourself, Sam.

868
01:33:09,661 --> 01:33:14,869
黄长官说 有什么事可以找你
Inspector Wong said to find you if I needed anything.

869
01:33:17,229 --> 01:33:20,133
你是不是真的会帮我?
Will you really help me?

870
01:34:32,484 --> 01:34:33,849
我以为你不会来
I thought you wouldn't come.

871
01:34:37,118 --> 01:34:39,090
为什么我不会来?
Why's that?

872
01:34:54,757 --> 01:34:56,856
怎么样?
So here we are.

873
01:34:56,857 --> 01:34:58,905
两年了
It's been two years.

874
01:35:00,159 --> 01:35:02,093
因为有份杀我爸爸
Because of my father's case,

875
01:35:02,392 --> 01:35:04,019
所以两年都不敢找我?
you didn't dare to call me for two years?

876
01:35:04,493 --> 01:35:05,824
不敢跟我说话?
You couldn't face me?

877
01:35:08,695 --> 01:35:10,471
是
Right.

878
01:35:20,497 --> 01:35:24,297
保险箱里 是倪家这两年的犯罪证据
All you need to nail Hau is in the safe.

879
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:28,358
我排好档案和日期了
I've organized the files according to date.

880
01:35:32,501 --> 01:35:33,763
为什么还肯帮我?
Why do you still help me?

881
01:35:42,438 --> 01:35:44,619
我不是想帮你
I'm not helping you.

882
01:35:46,305 --> 01:35:47,636
我是警察
I'm a cop.

883
01:35:48,806 --> 01:35:51,686
我答应过陆长官的事 我要做到
I want to keep my promises to SP Luk!

884
01:35:54,174 --> 01:35:55,869
我不想再做卧底了
And I don't want to be a mole anymore.

885
01:35:58,009 --> 01:36:00,773
再做两年 我就成尖沙嘴老大了
Two more years and I'll become the top dog in Tsim Sha Tsui.

886
01:36:02,010 --> 01:36:04,979
怎么办?想坐牢啊?
What for? To end up in prison?

887
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:14,775
以前的事我忘了
Let's bury the past.

888
01:36:15,814 --> 01:36:19,181
总之拜托你赶快办完这件事 调我回警署
Just finish up my case and bring me back into the department.

889
01:36:20,349 --> 01:36:22,442
给我一个平平稳稳的位子
Give me a decent desk.

890
01:36:23,249 --> 01:36:25,430
要对着海
Make sure it has a sea view.

891
01:36:26,817 --> 01:36:29,165
但是别再让我再见到你
And don't let me see your face again.

892
01:36:32,151 --> 01:36:32,845
放心吧
Don't worry.

893
01:36:33,152 --> 01:36:34,585
你不会见到我
You won't see me anymore.

894
01:36:35,820 --> 01:36:36,650
还有
One more thing.

895
01:36:38,587 --> 01:36:40,521
档案里有些字我不会写
I couldn't spell some of the words.

896
01:36:40,821 --> 01:36:42,118
你看不懂就来找我
Come find me if you don't understand.

897
01:36:43,222 --> 01:36:46,680
但千万别调乱了次序 我排了很久
But don't mess up the order.

898
01:36:47,190 --> 01:36:48,384
调乱了 我宰了你
I'll kill you if you mess that up.

899
01:36:50,191 --> 01:36:52,352
那就好了 债可以还清了
That's great. Put me out of misery.

900
01:36:53,058 --> 01:36:55,913
想得美
You wish.

901
01:37:02,828 --> 01:37:03,886
谢谢警官
Thank you, Officer.

902
01:38:08,029 --> 01:38:10,896
阿琛 资料齐了 律政司批示三天后上庭
Sum, we're all set. The trial will start in three days.

903
01:38:12,698 --> 01:38:13,665
韩先生
Mr. Han

904
01:39:13,681 --> 01:39:14,648
重案组
Hello, OCTB!

905
01:39:17,949 --> 01:39:20,417
黄长官 证人不见了
Inspector Wong! Sam's gone!

906
01:39:35,388 --> 01:39:37,322
韩琛应该是从厨房通道跑掉的
He escaped through the kitchen.

907
01:39:37,655 --> 01:39:39,122
谁把守厨房通道?
Who was guarding the kitchen?

908
01:39:42,990 --> 01:39:43,888
对不起 长官
Sorry, sir.

909
01:39:45,691 --> 01:39:47,750
黄长官 韩琛走之前
Officer Wong, Sam'd made a call to Thailand...

910
01:39:48,025 --> 01:39:49,424
打了个电话回泰国
...before he escaped

911
01:39:53,191 --> 01:39:54,180
喂
Hello?

912
01:40:44,108 --> 01:40:45,040
倪先生
Mr. Ngai.

913
01:40:46,008 --> 01:40:47,373
找我什么事啊?
What do you want from me?

914
01:40:49,275 --> 01:40:50,708
是你打话给我的
You called me.

915
01:40:52,110 --> 01:40:55,273
所以应该你告诉我 能帮我什么忙
So tell me how you can help me.

916
01:40:55,578 --> 01:40:57,512
对吧?坐
Am I right? Sit down.

917
01:41:08,782 --> 01:41:10,079
杀我吧
Kill me.

918
01:41:13,282 --> 01:41:14,943
杀了我就天下太平了
Kill me and it's all over.

919
01:41:15,917 --> 01:41:17,282
我为什么要杀你?
Why should I?

920
01:41:17,751 --> 01:41:19,275
我没干这种事很久了
Haven't done that kind of stuff for ages.

921
01:41:23,085 --> 01:41:25,645
有什么话 可以坐下来慢慢商量
Everything can be negotiated, Sam.

922
01:41:26,020 --> 01:41:27,953
香港这么大
Hong Kong's big enough for us both, Sam.

923
01:41:27,954 --> 01:41:31,507
你愿意的话 我们可以一起合作
We can even be partners.

924
01:41:35,256 --> 01:41:36,689
以前的事算了
Let's forget about the past.

925
01:41:53,161 --> 01:41:54,788
你一定会杀我
You will kill me.

926
01:41:56,329 --> 01:41:57,956
今晚你就会杀我
You 'll kill me tonight.

927
01:42:09,166 --> 01:42:11,760
我杀了你 你老婆和女儿怎么办?
But who's gonna take care of your family?

928
01:42:30,305 --> 01:42:31,237
刚刚收到消息
Just in!

929
01:42:31,506 --> 01:42:33,974
倪永孝抓了韩琛在泰国的老婆和女儿
Hau has Sam's wife and daughter as hostages.

930
01:42:34,906 --> 01:42:37,204
那是他泰国的佣人
That's his Thai maid.

931
01:42:46,543 --> 01:42:49,637
这几年 我死不了
I managed to stay alive all these years.

932
01:42:51,311 --> 01:42:52,801
是因为
It's all because...

933
01:42:54,045 --> 01:42:55,774
我有帮个很好的泰国朋友
... I have some good buddies in Thailand

934
01:43:02,548 --> 01:43:04,038
你也听听这个电话
You want to take this call.

935
01:43:06,716 --> 01:43:08,115
打去夏威夷的
It's from Hawaii.

936
01:43:12,884 --> 01:43:14,351
你全家都在那儿
Your whole family's there.

937
01:43:16,685 --> 01:43:18,050
包括我泰国的朋友
My Thai buddies, too.

938
01:43:29,356 --> 01:43:30,687
你好 倪先生
Hey, Mr. Ngai.

939
01:43:30,922 --> 01:43:31,820
我老大吩咐我
My boss asked me

940
01:43:32,157 --> 01:43:34,022
叫我好好的照顾你家人
to take good care of your family

941
01:43:46,161 --> 01:43:48,459
爸爸!爸爸在哪儿?
<i>Daddy! Where are you?</i>

942
01:43:54,196 --> 01:43:54,890
倪先生
Mr. Ngai!

943
01:43:59,764 --> 01:44:00,731
闭嘴
Shut up!

944
01:44:06,666 --> 01:44:08,531
我说了你今晚会杀我的喽
You 'll whack me tonight. I told you so.

945
01:44:37,537 --> 01:44:40,267
警察!别动!
Police!Freeze!Freeze!

946
01:45:04,583 --> 01:45:06,881
倪永孝 放下枪
Put it down, Ngai Wing-Hau!

947
01:45:07,317 --> 01:45:08,409
由着他吧
Let him!

948
01:45:10,518 --> 01:45:12,179
他以前杀过我
He tried to kill me once before.

949
01:45:13,352 --> 01:45:14,979
就让他再杀一次吧
Let him do it again!

950
01:45:23,055 --> 01:45:24,317
各位警官
Officers!

951
01:45:26,689 --> 01:45:28,486
等会儿他打死我
After he shoots me...

952
01:45:30,057 --> 01:45:31,991
开不开枪就随便你们啦
...it'll be your call to shoot him or not!

953
01:45:38,826 --> 01:45:42,557
出来跑 迟早要还的
What goes around comes around!

954
01:47:59,200 --> 01:48:00,326
两个问题
Two questions.

955
01:48:03,833 --> 01:48:05,664
你有没有杀光他全家?
Did you kill his whole family?

956
01:48:08,100 --> 01:48:09,192
当然没有
Of course not!

957
01:48:11,634 --> 01:48:14,762
我和泰国朋友 吓唬他呢!
My Thai buddies and I were just bluffing.

958
01:48:17,702 --> 01:48:19,431
你早就料到我会帮你杀他?
Did you expect me to kill him for you?

959
01:48:28,436 --> 01:48:30,370
我说没有 你相信吗?
Would you believe me if I said no?

960
01:48:30,870 --> 01:48:32,861
我准备好死在这里的
I expected to die here!

961
01:48:34,503 --> 01:48:36,334
我只有这个办法
It was my only way.

962
01:48:43,104 --> 01:48:44,036
对不起
Sorry.

963
01:48:47,438 --> 01:48:49,770
你知不知道我用了多少时间
Did you know how hard I worked...

964
01:48:50,271 --> 01:48:52,000
我搜集了多少证据
...to collect tons of evidence...

965
01:48:52,671 --> 01:48:54,434
足够让他坐一辈子牢
...to put him away for life?

966
01:49:16,740 --> 01:49:17,707
喂 哪位?
Who's this?

967
01:49:18,740 --> 01:49:19,707
找琛哥?
How are you?

968
01:49:20,040 --> 01:49:21,735
琛哥 泰国人
The Thai guy, Sam.

969
01:49:26,975 --> 01:49:27,907
保罗
Paul!

970
01:49:29,075 --> 01:49:30,133
谢谢
Thank you.

971
01:49:30,474 --> 01:49:31,566
那就好了
Everything went according to plan.

972
01:49:31,734 --> 01:49:34,703
以后我们合作
We're now partners.

973
01:49:36,075 --> 01:49:38,066
货直接卖到香港
The cocaine will ship straight to HK without any middlemen from now on.

974
01:49:38,342 --> 01:49:42,359
倪家的事 要不要我来摆平啊?
<i>Should I take care of the rest of the Ngai Family?</i>

975
01:49:42,709 --> 01:49:43,971
保罗
Paul...

976
01:49:45,209 --> 01:49:48,548
我想 别做得的太绝了吧!
Maybe we shouldn't go too far.

977
01:49:48,549 --> 01:49:51,573
之前你碰上我
It was destiny that you bumped into me.

978
01:49:52,943 --> 01:49:54,808
算你捡回了条命
Otherwise you would've been killed.

979
01:49:55,377 --> 01:49:57,208
那枪没打死你
<i>We were destined to be partners</i>

980
01:49:57,477 --> 01:49:59,411
我们就是拍档
<i>when my gun failed to kill you .</i>

981
01:49:59,878 --> 01:50:01,812
- 就要做得那么绝 - 好!
- <i>Forget you ever knew the meaning of "too far. "</i> - OK

982
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:34,215
在会展新翼进行的中英交接仪式
<i>The hand-over ceremony of Hong Kong</i>

983
