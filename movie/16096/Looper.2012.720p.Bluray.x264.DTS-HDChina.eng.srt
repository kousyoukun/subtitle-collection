1
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:44,105
<i>Time travel has not yet been invented.</i>

2
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:47,400
<i>But 30 years from now,
it will have been.</i>

3
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:52,363
<i>It will be instantly out/awed,</i>

4
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:57,410
<i>used only in secret
by the largest criminal organizations.</i>

5
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:11,799
<i>It's nearly impossible
to dispose of a body in the future.</i>

6
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:15,435
<i>I'm told.
Tagging techniques, whatnot.</i>

7
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:19,599
<i>So when these criminal organizations
in the future need someone gone,</i>

8
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:25,022
<i>they use specialized assassins
in our present called loopers.</i>

9
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,530
<i>And so,</i>

10
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,909
<i>my employers in the future
nab the target.</i>

11
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:33,662
<i>They zap him back to me,
their looper.</i>

12
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,825
<i>He appears,
hands tied and head sacked.</i>

13
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:40,286
<i>And I do the necessaries.</i>

14
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:42,830
<i>Collect my silver.</i>

15
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,087
<i>So the target is vanished
from the future,</i>

16
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:49,970
<i>and I've just disposed of a body
that technically does not exist.</i>

17
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:54,929
<i>Clean.</i>

18
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,821
How's the French?
Slow.

19
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,357
How's the coffee?
Burnt.

20
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:26,878
...the devil bring you into hell!
You have to heal yourself.

21
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,062
Two, Jed.

22
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,654
Hey, Joe.

23
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,737
Be at the club tonight?
Yeah.

24
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,526
Four, Jed.

25
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:20,977
Bang.

26
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,133
Hey, walk around.

27
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:04,013
Around the bike. I'm not kidding!
Wide around, you shit!

28
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,978
Rude! If you had a mama,
she didn't raise you right.

29
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,610
That's funny. I'm going to pick
your mother up later on my bike,

30
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,488
and I'm gonna take my blunderbuss...
Hey, Seth.

31
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,028
Hey, Joe.
That's new.

32
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:17,818
Yeah, thanks.

33
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,988
Goddamn thing
won't fucking start.

34
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,907
So you going to the Belle?

35
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,333
- So you bought a slat bike?
- Yup.

36
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,998
How much that thing set you back?
How much?

37
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,132
I was gonna pull up in it tonight.

38
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,295
Well, congratulations.
You're pulling up with me instead.

39
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:39,431
Don't. If we're going in,
don't do that.

40
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,342
Chicks dig TKs.
They do not.

41
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:46,389
Yes, they do.
It's tacky. Don't do it.

42
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:52,690
<i>About 10 percent of the
population has this TK mutation.</i>

43
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:56,699
<i>When it first appeared, everyone
thought we were gonna get superheroes.</i>

44
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,201
<i>But it turns out this was it.</i>

45
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:03,364
<i>Now it's a bunch of assholes, think they're
blowing your mind floating quarters.</i>

46
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,961
<i>It's like this whole town.</i>

47
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:20,597
<i>Big heads, small potatoes.</i>

48
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,979
Full house tonight, Joe.
We'll stick backstage.

49
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,691
Just meeting up.
Packing your blunderbusses?

50
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,855
- Hardly. Right, Seth?
- I'm with Joe.

51
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:39,366
- Just meeting up, in and out.
- Go on.

52
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,115
Suzie!

53
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,750
Hey!
You working a shift tonight?

54
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,502
Yeah.
Yeah?

55
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,129
A gat man bought me out
already for the night.

56
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:54,790
Oh.

57
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,001
Sweetie, I've got to work.

58
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,850
Hey, Joe.

59
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,654
What?
Zach. He's in there right now with Abe.

60
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,156
For what?
Closed his loop.

61
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,067
No shit?

62
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:27,284
<i>There's a reason we're called loopers.</i>

63
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:32,703
<i>When we sign up for this job,
taking out the future's garbage,</i>

64
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:36,339
<i>we also agree
to a very specific proviso.</i>

65
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,219
<i>Time travel in the future is so illegal,</i>

66
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:44,427
<i>that when our employers
want to close our contracts,</i>

67
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:49,095
<i>they'll also want to erase any trace of
their relationship with us ever existing.</i>

68
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:54,983
<i>So if we're still alive
30 years from now,</i>

69
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:59,942
<i>they'll find our older self,
zap him back to us,</i>

70
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:03,075
<i>and we'll kill him like any other job.</i>

71
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,738
<i>This is called closing your loop.</i>

72
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,458
<i>Eh, you get a golden payday,
you get a handshake,</i>

73
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,836
<i>and you get released
from your contract.</i>

74
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,464
<i>Enjoy the next 30 years.</i>

75
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:22,628
<i>This job doesn't tend to attract
the most forward-thinking people.</i>

76
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:25,593
So we celebrating?

77
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,928
Yeah! Yeah!

78
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:30,803
Whoo!

79
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,629
Look out!

80
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,431
Shit.

81
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,595
Jesus.

82
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,810
Fuck, Joe.

83
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,551
Ooh, la, la.

84
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,310
What, fourth loop
closed this month?

85
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,517
Loop closed. Here we go.

86
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,949
Loop closed, baby!

87
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,613
Yeah.

88
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,044
Seth?

89
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,955
Jesus.

90
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,250
Shh. They could be here
any minute.

91
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,010
Are they here?
No. Who?

92
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:13,174
Oh, Christ. Joe, Christ!

93
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,808
What are you doing?
Give me the gun.

94
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,560
Oh, right. That's smart.

95
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,767
Get away from the window.
Christ, Joe.

96
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,102
Just quiet down.
You can protect me.

97
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:23,938
So they...
What did you do?

98
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,104
Oh, jeez.
This is like a nightmare.

99
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,655
This is a nightmare.

100
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:33,193
<i>I knew then what he did,
so I don't know why I asked.</i>

101
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,111
What did you do?

102
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:40,493
He... He was singing.

103
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:46,377
<i>Through the gag and sack,
but I could hear the tune.</i>

104
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,301
<i>Deep memories,</i>

105
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,258
<i>my mom in a dark room,</i>

106
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,344
<i>taking care of me, singing that tune.</i>

107
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:01,771
Once I knew he was me...

108
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,230
I...

109
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,195
Joe, I couldn't.

110
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:12,358
I couldn't. I had to see.

111
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:18,955
<i>He told me... I remember, he told me,</i>

112
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:23,536
there's a new holy terror boss man
in the future,

113
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,295
and he's closing all the loops.

114
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,957
The Rainmaker, they call him.

115
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:34,004
He told me it.
Then he wanted a cigarette.

116
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,767
So I untied him,
and he gives me this look.

117
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,313
And he just starts running.

118
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:45,811
<i>I had my blunderbuss,</i>

119
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:49,444
<i>so I know I've got about 15 strides
till he's out of my range.</i>

120
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,775
<i>And they come and they go,</i>

121
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:56,318
and I just watch him
till he's gone.

122
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,328
<i>This is called letting your loop run.</i>

123
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,330
<i>It's not a good thing.</i>

124
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,366
What do I do?

125
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:08,505
You're the only friend I've got, Joe.
You've got to help me.

126
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,424
You're a fucking idiot
coming here.

127
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,171
You can't be here.
I'll give you some money.

128
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:19,386
Joe! A little money?
Where am I gonna go?

129
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,830
You hop a freight train.
You beat it the hell out of town.

130
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,226
Shh!

131
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,648
Just don't move.

132
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,777
<i>Tell Court,
watch the window outside.</i>

133
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,612
<i>You got it, window.</i>

134
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,153
- Kid Blue, Joe! Come on!
- Just a minute!

135
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,790
Open this goddamn door!
I can't do anything for you, Seth.

136
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:47,748
You've got to hide me!
Please, Joe! Hide me!

137
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:52,006
Please! Just buy me some time
and then I'll go! Please?

138
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,213
You gonna make
me blow this door down?

139
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,002
Yeah, hold on!

140
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,839
Please?

141
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,432
Move. Move.

142
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,560
Come on, Joe! Open up!

143
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,780
Jesus.

144
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,000
That took a while.
You think it's easy looking this good?

145
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:32,084
Tye's gonna watch your apartment
while we go have a talk with Abe.

146
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,749
There's coffee in the tin.

147
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,213
Thank you.

148
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,150
<i>Give me two minutes.</i>

149
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:13,580
Know why they call that pea shooter
of yours a blunderbuss?

150
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:17,672
Because it's impossible to hit
anything farther than 15 yards.

151
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,508
Impossible to miss anything closer.

152
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,844
It's a gun for fuck-up turkeys.

153
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,595
Not like a gat.

154
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:30,187
A gat has range.

155
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,853
Accuracy.

156
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,437
Kid, cut it out.
Don't blow your other foot off.

157
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:05,761
Fuck!
What the hell is going on out there?

158
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,810
How you doing, Abe?
Hey, Joe.

159
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,972
You didn't shoot your
other foot off, did you, Kid?

160
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:16,560
All right.

161
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:23,067
My great-grandfather told my
grandfather, "Men are like spiders.

162
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,740
It's the little ones
you've got to be careful of."

163
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:29,156
Don't know I agree with that.

164
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,286
Yeah? Huh.

165
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:34,457
What the fuck did my
great-grandfather know?

166
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:36,747
<i>This man is from the future.</i>

167
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:41,043
<i>He was sent back here by the mob,
a one-way ticket, to run the loopers.</i>

168
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:44,053
<i>That's low effort, even for Abe,
so to pass the time,</i>

169
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:48,262
<i>he recruited some real muscle,
the gat men. Now he runs the city.</i>

170
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:51,223
<i>Any other city,
that would be impressive.</i>

171
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,322
How can you kids
stand to wear those chokers?

172
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,036
Cravats?
Ties.

173
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,915
Ridiculous. You're aware
we don't have a dress code?

174
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,873
Fashion.
You know... Well, you don't know.

175
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:19,539
The movies that you're dressing like
are just copying other movies.

176
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,714
These goddamn 20th century
affectations.

177
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,549
Do something new. Huh?

178
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:30,683
Put a glowing thing around
your neck or use rubberized...

179
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,310
Just be new.
Okay.

180
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:43,439
It was nice chatting with you, Abe.
I do like you, Joe.

181
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,403
But we're sure enough
that Seth paid you a visit.

182
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,364
We have to do something.
Seth?

183
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:51,951
You're expecting we're gonna
break your fingers with a hammer,

184
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:53,581
or something awful.

185
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:57,414
But I'm gonna defuse that tension right now.
That's not gonna happen.

186
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:01,377
What is gonna happen
is that I'm gonna talk for a little.

187
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,541
Not even that long.

188
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,881
And you're gonna give up
your friend.

189
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:10,173
My friend? Seth?
Sorry, I'm confused.

190
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,182
Well, then I'll talk a little.

191
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:15,265
You know, you were
the youngest looper I ever hired.

192
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,722
You looked goddamn ridiculous,
they said.

193
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,859
Blunderbuss up to here on you.

194
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:25,739
They brought you in. I forget what for.
Watch shop.

195
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:29,742
Yeah. You rolled one of our fronts,
a watch shop.

196
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:34,576
And they had you, you know.
This kid, like an animal.

197
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:38,539
But you looked at me,
your hair stuck to half your face,

198
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:42,001
just one eye looking at me.
I could see,

199
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:47,051
like seeing it happen on the TV,
the bad version of your life.

200
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:52,716
Like a vision,
I could see how you'd turn bad.

201
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,884
So I changed it.

202
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:59,184
I cleaned you up
and put a gun in your hand.

203
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,110
I gave you something that was yours.
I'm grateful for that, Abe.

204
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:08,023
I gave you something
that was yours.

205
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:11,613
And I remember that kid.

206
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:18,662
And I think if you ask yourself, you ask,
“Who would I sacrifice for what's mine?"

207
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:22,579
I think Seth would be deep and cozy
inside that circle.

208
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:28,126
I'll show you how much
I know you. Ahem.

209
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,922
I'm not even gonna break you.
I'm just gonna set you back a ways.

210
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:36,559
We know that you've been
stashing half your bars.

211
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,721
Which is smart, no law against it.
You're gonna get out.

212
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,686
You're gonna go overseas.
Studying up your Mandarin?

213
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,350
French? French.

214
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:51,111
You give him up
or you give us half your stash.

215
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:54,653
You willing to dump
your silver in the dirt

216
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,870
for Seth?

217
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:08,337
You're gonna kill him.

218
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:13,005
Not if we can help it. Be too
cataclysmic a change for the future.

219
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,923
What we'll do is dangerous
in that regards,

220
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,263
though not as dangerous
as killing him.

221
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:22,602
On top of which a man from the future
runs free long enough,

222
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:26,943
this time travel shit
fries your brain like an egg.

223
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:28,398
Why the fuck French?

224
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,988
I'm going to France.

225
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,741
You should go to China.
I'm going to France.

226
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,322
I'm from the future.
You should go to China.

227
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,783
I'm going to France.
You're going...

228
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,132
The floor safe, under the rug.

229
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:56,012
Six seven four two.

230
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:04,055
It's the little ones that get you.

231
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:14,528
Why don't you kill an hour, Joe.
On the house.

232
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,704
Call the doc.

233
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:59,295
Wait.

234
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,340
Wait!

235
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,885
Wait.

236
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,540
You know, I can't
remember my mother's face.

237
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:19,334
She used to run her hands
through my hair.

238
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,511
Just like this.

239
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:46,910
I think I just let my best friend
get killed tonight.

240
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,451
For silver.

241
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:56,874
Shit.

242
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,414
Yeah.

243
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,836
Shit.

244
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,054
Sorry.

245
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,430
I'm gonna give you some money.

246
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:14,438
I've been stashing my silver for years
and I'm gonna give you half of it.

247
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,475
You can raise your kid right.

248
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,564
You wanna give me half your silver?

249
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:23,732
Silver's got strings.
I got my job.

250
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,530
You got yours.

251
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:31,705
It's sweet of you to worry about me,
but I'm doing fine.

252
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:36,706
Why don't we just stick
to services rendered.

253
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,592
Is this what you want?

254
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,426
Shit!

255
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:32,525
Then it just becomes a
mess, like a pig fucking a football.

256
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:35,567
You know what I'm saying.
Let's finish this up.

257
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:40,905
There's 24 there.
I'm keeping count.

258
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,750
Two more trips
should just do it.

259
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:10,021
Goddamn it! Aah!

260
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,397
Kid, I'm sorry!
Tell Abe I'm gonna fix this!

261
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:19,068
Tell him I'm gonna find my loop
and I'm gonna kill him! Tell Abe...

262
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,079
Motherfucker!

263
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:05,423
<i>Rainmaker...</i>.

264
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,531
Shit!

265
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,307
You got any aspirin?
Uh-huh.

266
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,514
All of them, please.

267
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,858
I'll take that coat too.

268
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:28,167
What are you doing?

269
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:33,794
What are you doing?
Joe, I told you to run.

270
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,736
Don't do it, you idiot.

271
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:05,833
Hurry up, Blue!

272
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:10,414
That's the second loop we had
run this week. It's getting endemic.

273
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:13,879
Fucking Kid Blue.

274
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:16,386
About two more trips
should do it.

275
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,337
Shit.

276
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,574
You stupid little shit.

277
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,620
Pound the pavement,
sweep the train yard.

278
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:35,666
Every second that passes is bad.
Get on it.

279
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,217
Stupid little shit.

280
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,253
I can fix this.

281
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,761
I can find him!
Go home.

282
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:45,800
Let the grownups work.

283
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,978
Kid Blue.

284
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:30,304
You bastard. How do I find you?

285
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:39,603
Coffee?

286
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:43,444
Please.

287
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,443
Black. And some water.

288
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:48,153
Anything else?

289
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:50,493
We eating?

290
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,703
I ordered something.

291
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:55,035
Steak and eggs.
Rare and scrambled.

292
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:57,246
Two steak and eggs, coming up.

293
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:04,249
Must hurt.

294
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:08,386
I wasn't sure you'd remember her.
I put it together.

295
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,505
Clever.

296
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:20,815
You know, there's another girl
who works here on the weekends.

297
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:26,605
Jen?
Right. Less letters.

298
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:29,107
That'd be better.

299
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,999
How's your French coming?

300
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:42,662
Good. You gonna tell me
I ought to be learning Mandarin?

301
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:44,627
I never regretted
learning French.

302
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:48,088
I know you have
a gun between your legs.

303
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:52,218
No? Well, you'll get it eventually.

304
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,220
Obviously.All right, listen.

305
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:59,058
This is a hard situation, but we both
know how this has to go down.

306
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,564
I can't let you walk away
from this diner.

307
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:04,646
This is my life now. I earned it.
You had yours already.

308
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:09,565
So why don't you do what old men do
and die? Get the fuck out of my way.

309
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:13,109
Why don't you take your gun out
from between your legs and do it?

310
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,162
Boy.

311
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:25,463
It's hard staring into your eyes.

312
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,384
It's too strange.
Your face looks backwards.

313
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,174
So you know what's gonna happen?
You've done all this already?

314
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,889
I don't want to talk about
time travel shit.

315
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:42,100
If we start talking about it,
we're gonna be here all day.

316
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:43,936
Making diagrams with straws.

317
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:47,102
It doesn't matter.
I hurt myself, it changes your body.

318
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:50,272
Does what I do change your memories?
It doesn't matter!

319
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:04,832
My memory is cloudy.

320
00:45:05,995 --> 00:45:07,793
It's a cloud.

321
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:10,920
Because my memories
aren't really memories.

322
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:13,836
They're just one possible
eventuality now.

323
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:21,140
And they grow clearer or cloudier
as they become more or less likely.

324
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:25,648
But then they get to the present moment,
and they're instantly clear again.

325
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:29,478
I can remember
what you do after you do it.

326
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:33,990
And it hurts.

327
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,318
So even when we're apart,

328
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:38,703
you can remember what I do after?
Yes.

329
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:43,082
But this is a precise description
of a fuzzy mechanism.

330
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:45,619
It's messy.

331
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:47,961
All I know... I know two things.

332
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:52,421
I know what's happening in my head.
And I know that you're gonna meet her.

333
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,469
Who?

334
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:07,144
She's gonna save your life.

335
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:15,653
For a long time, she thought we'd...

336
00:46:16,649 --> 00:46:18,822
We'd have a baby.

337
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:24,032
She'd have been a great mother.

338
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,079
She wanted it so much.
Yeah, but she...?

339
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:31,539
How...?

340
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:34,917
So she saves my life?

341
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:36,085
Yes.

342
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,597
Let's take a look at your life.

343
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:42,429
You're a killer.
And a junkie.

344
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:44,719
A fucking child mentality.

345
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:48,560
“What's mine." "My life."
Save your life. You're asking me how?

346
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:51,897
The question is why. Why would
someone sacrifice their life?

347
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,687
Cut your high and mighty bullshit.
I don't need my life...

348
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:57,357
Shut your fucking child mouth.

349
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:01,577
You're so self-absorbed and stupid.

350
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:04,660
And she's gonna clean you up
and she's gonna...

351
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:17,169
You're gonna take her love
like a sponge.

352
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:20,589
And you think,
“Maybe I'm clear of the past.

353
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:22,553
Maybe I'm safe."

354
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:25,510
Yesterday.

355
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:28,099
Yesterday what?

356
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:31,937
Thirty years from now
is yesterday.

357
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,565
You're not gonna remember it.

358
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:48,120
<i>I'm gonna tell you what happens</i>

359
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:52,082
to this beautiful woman
who <i>saves</i> your worthless fucking life.

360
00:48:36,205 --> 00:48:38,754
Have you heard of the Rainmaker?

361
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,588
Yeah, Seth said that night.

362
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:47,384
New boss in the future?
He used the words "holy terror."

363
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:50,269
Yeah. A reign of terror.

364
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:54,308
Mass executions. Vagrant purges.
Everywhere at once.

365
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:57,192
Legend is the Rainmaker
came out of nowhere.

366
00:48:57,351 --> 00:49:01,356
In the span of six months, he took total
control of the five major syndicates.

367
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:03,900
That'd take an army.
He didn't have an army.

368
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:06,489
The story is
that he did it alone.

369
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:09,197
Alone alone.
So how did he do it?

370
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:13,743
That's the mystery. There's no pictures
of him. Even if it is a him. It's insane.

371
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:18,415
There are stories he has a synthetic jaw,
saw his morn shot, shit like that.

372
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:20,959
Word spread through
the ex-looper grapevine

373
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:25,096
because the first thing he did
was start closing loops. All of them.

374
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:31,727
You know what this is?
This number?

375
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:33,354
<i>Dale, wait. Slow down.</i>

376
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:37,142
It could lead us to the Rainmaker, Joe!
It's in the hospital records.

377
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:39,310
Write this down: 0, 7, 1, 5, 3,

378
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:43,314
9, 0, 2, 9, 3, 5!

379
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:55,997
<i>This is a piece of
identifying information on the Rainmaker.</i>

380
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:01,508
<i>He's here. He lives here now.
In this county.</i>

381
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,838
<i>And I'm gonna use this to find him.</i>

382
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:06,095
And I'm gonna kill him.

383
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,472
I'm gonna stop him
from killing my wife.

384
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:12,602
Fuck you. And your wife.
None of this concerns me.

385
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,058
This is gonna happen...
it happened to you.

386
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:19,442
It doesn't have to happen to me. You got
her picture right there in my watch?

387
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,444
Show me the picture.
As soon as I see her, I walk away.

388
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:25,482
I'll fucking marry someone else.
Promise.

389
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:29,152
When I see that picture, that fog
inside your brain should just

390
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:32,413
swallow up all the memories,
right? She'll be gone.

391
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:35,958
If you give her up, she'll be safe.
Give her up?

392
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:40,087
You're the one that got her killed.
If she never meets you, she's safe.

393
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:42,920
You don't understand.
We don't have to give her up.

394
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:46,882
I'm not gonna give her up.
I'm gonna save her.

395
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:04,354
Get to the fields.
We can lose them in the fields.

396
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:08,695
Hop a train. Get out of town!

397
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:37,433
What the hell is everybody doing?
You wait for my signal!

398
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:40,314
- Out back! He's running!
- He ran out the back!

399
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:52,076
Shit!

400
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,163
Alive!

401
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:08,550
Fuck! Shit! Come on, come on!

402
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:11,087
Come on, you piece of shit!
Come on!

403
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:23,437
Get the tracker! The tracker!
Go! Go!

404
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:25,601
Fuck! Fuck!

405
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:28,528
Shit.

406
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:14,092
Come on, baby. Time to get up.

407
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:57,261
Listen up, fucker!

408
00:54:57,419 --> 00:55:03,051
I have shot and buried
three vagrants in the past year!

409
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:07,188
So I don't care
what hobo sob story you've got.

410
00:55:07,346 --> 00:55:10,816
I get a dozen a week, pal.
It cuts no cash with me.

411
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:16,231
But if you show your face here again,
I will cut you the fuck in half!

412
00:55:57,354 --> 00:56:01,359
Well, you found him.

413
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:05,488
Tracking Seth's bike,
that was clever.

414
00:56:05,654 --> 00:56:08,783
Then you rustled up a posse
and went out to get him.

415
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:12,328
I could do it again.
You can fuck up again? Really?

416
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:14,747
I've got too much riding, Kid.

417
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:18,793
I can't afford a fuck-up
playing cowboy.

418
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:21,549
Put your gat on the table.

419
00:56:39,855 --> 00:56:42,449
I wanted you to say I did good.

420
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:46,536
That's all I wanted.

421
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:51,412
This is all I have.

422
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:00,759
Please give me one more chance?

423
00:57:00,918 --> 00:57:04,138
I'll bring him here alive and hold him.

424
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:07,716
And you can put a bullet
in his brain yourself.

425
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:10,431
No!

426
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:19,903
Get off me! Get off me!

427
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:10,992
Hey, who's there?

428
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:19,088
Stop right there! I will shoot you.

429
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:23,918
You stop! Stop right there!

430
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:30,424
I'm telling you to stop! You stop!

431
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:03,586
Head's splitting apart.

432
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:05,967
My head.
Hey.

433
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:09,130
Look up at the light.
Look up at me.

434
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:10,764
How long since you dropped?

435
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:12,799
Dropped?
Dropped.

436
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:15,390
A day.
A day.

437
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:16,929
I can't feel my legs.

438
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:19,814
You're going through withdrawal,
you fucking junkie.

439
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,271
You gotta help me. I'm gonna die.

440
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:25,320
I'm thirsty.

441
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:28,448
Water. Water!

442
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,838
Thirsty...

443
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:01,977
Cid!

444
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:05,060
Come inside, baby.

445
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:09,106
Who is that man?
He's just a vagrant.

446
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,366
No, he's not.
Oh, yeah?

447
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:13,823
His shoes are too shiny.

448
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:15,908
Aren't you a smart monkey.

449
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:18,449
Is he sick?
Yup.

450
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:21,038
Will he get better?
Yeah.

451
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:25,251
Promise?
Just go to sleep, okay, baby boy?

452
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:32,213
Night, sweetie.
Night, Sara.

453
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:10,834
Hey!

454
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:22,266
The first time I saw her face.

455
01:01:22,429 --> 01:01:24,056
First time I saw her face.

456
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:25,974
Look at me.

457
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:27,852
No.

458
01:01:28,018 --> 01:01:30,112
The first time I saw her face.

459
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:34,984
The first time I saw her face.
The first time I saw your face.

460
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:37,619
The first time I saw her face.

461
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:22,452
Morning, monkey.
Do you want something to eat?

462
01:02:22,614 --> 01:02:24,662
The man's up.

463
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:27,711
Is he staying here now?

464
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:29,296
No.

465
01:02:35,377 --> 01:02:36,799
Toss it.

466
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:40,553
I'm about to finish cleaning it.
Put it down.

467
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:46,763
How are you feeling?
I'd say I'm at 30 percent.

468
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:49,934
You take it slow,
by the end of the week you'll be at 50.

469
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:55,105
I took you in so you wouldn't die.
You're not.

470
01:02:55,272 --> 01:02:58,116
Take the morning to rest,
then get off my farm.

471
01:02:58,275 --> 01:03:00,243
I can't do that.
I'm sorry?

472
01:03:00,402 --> 01:03:02,450
I need to stay here for a little while.

473
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:04,364
I'm not cool with that.
Sorry.

474
01:03:04,531 --> 01:03:07,535
You just lost your
“take the morning to rest" privileges.

475
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:09,169
Get off my farm.
No.

476
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:11,329
Get off my farm.

477
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:14,420
You couldn't scare a retarded hobo
with that. Literally.

478
01:03:14,582 --> 01:03:17,335
This is a Remington 870.
One blast could cut you...

479
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:19,880
In half. That's telling.
You're holding a gun.

480
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:22,925
I say I'm not afraid,
so you describe the gun to me.

481
01:03:23,091 --> 01:03:24,968
It's not the gun I'm not afraid of.

482
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:27,183
What are you gonna do,
shoot in the air?

483
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:30,189
You wouldn't let me die,
you're not gonna kill me.

484
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:31,895
So that makes me weak?

485
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:35,562
I'm not a threat to you or your boy.
I need to be on your property.

486
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:39,233
I'd rather there's no contact at all.
I'm gonna stay in the fields.

487
01:03:39,399 --> 01:03:43,245
There's one thing I need, then you'll
never have to deal with me again.

488
01:03:43,403 --> 01:03:46,122
Verify this is your house
so I'm in the right place.

489
01:03:46,281 --> 01:03:48,409
What's this?
It's a map.

490
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:50,327
That's my house.
Why is it marked?

491
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:54,339
Okay, doesn't matter. Look, I'm gonna
be out of the barn in an hour.

492
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:57,216
If you can spare it,
I'm gonna take this canteen.

493
01:03:57,375 --> 01:04:01,050
Is there somewhere I can fill it?
This number, how did you get this?

494
01:04:02,964 --> 01:04:04,762
That mean something to you?

495
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:08,975
What? Hey! Hey! Hey!

496
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:24,535
You're right. I'm not a killer.

497
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:28,415
But I'm fine with how a blast of rock
salt to your face won't kill you.

498
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:31,292
Now you're gonna tell me
who you are,

499
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:34,625
and what the fuck
you're doing on my farm.

500
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:36,290
Okay.

501
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:41,177
Time travel hasn't been invented yet,

502
01:04:41,336 --> 01:04:45,716
but in 30 years, it will have been.
It's gonna be used by these criminal...

503
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:47,555
You're a looper?

504
01:05:00,105 --> 01:05:02,824
I can't go back to the city
because Abe, the boss,

505
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:07,408
his men will be searching for me 24/7
until they find me. Or find him.

506
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:08,913
All I've got is that map.

507
01:05:09,364 --> 01:05:12,789
He had three houses marked on it,
yours is one of them.

508
01:05:12,951 --> 01:05:15,045
I know he's coming here.

509
01:05:16,496 --> 01:05:18,794
You know about loopers?
You know what we do?

510
01:05:18,957 --> 01:05:22,632
So he's coming here
to murder my son

511
01:05:22,794 --> 01:05:25,673
because he thinks he might be
this Rainmaker?

512
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:29,301
Once he kills the Rainmaker,
what happens?

513
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:32,391
I think he thinks if he killed
the Rainmaker,

514
01:05:32,554 --> 01:05:34,556
he never would
have been sent back.

515
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:37,851
He'd just vanish.
He'd disappear just like he appeared.

516
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:41,738
He'd be back with his wife.

517
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:46,113
<i>Who is he, this guy you let run?</i>

518
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:48,199
Just some random guy
from the future?

519
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:51,740
He's just somebody.
You know what the numbers mean?

520
01:05:55,243 --> 01:05:57,245
This is Cid's birthday

521
01:05:57,412 --> 01:06:00,336
and this is the med code
of the hospital he was born in.

522
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:10,133
How many kids were born in that
hospital that day with your son?

523
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:12,052
- Like, two?
- Sounds right.

524
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:15,518
Three kids, three houses
marked on his map.

525
01:06:15,763 --> 01:06:17,265
One of them is the Rainmaker.

526
01:06:17,432 --> 01:06:20,151
He doesn't know which.
What's he gonna do?

527
01:06:21,561 --> 01:06:23,484
Oh, God.

528
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:15,433
Can he really do this?
Think about what doing this would fix.

529
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:18,394
What he thinks it would fix.

530
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:25,818
If he comes here, will you stop him?

531
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:31,236
I'm asking, can I trust you?
I don't care if you trust me.

532
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:33,401
I don't care about your son.

533
01:08:33,568 --> 01:08:36,868
I lost my life.
I kill this man, I get it back.

534
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:45,706
He'll kill the other two kids and come here last.
Put off facing me.

535
01:08:46,581 --> 01:08:49,334
All this goddamn cane
leaves us blind.

536
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:53,130
He can get within 50 yards of this
place without a hawk spotting him.

537
01:08:53,463 --> 01:08:56,137
What makes sense is we burn the fields.
Level them.

538
01:08:57,008 --> 01:08:59,386
How much gas you got
in that barn?

539
01:08:59,761 --> 01:09:03,686
No, you can't burn down my cane fields.
This stuff is half dead anyway.

540
01:09:03,848 --> 01:09:09,321
It's the seed for next year. It's
not gonna happen, you fucking nut.

541
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:17,446
Listen, use what you need
and set up anywhere.

542
01:09:17,612 --> 01:09:20,206
But one thing:
I don't want you talking to Cid.

543
01:09:20,365 --> 01:09:22,288
I watch my son, you watch the cane.

544
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:24,043
That's the deal.
Good by me.

545
01:09:24,202 --> 01:09:25,624
Fine.

546
01:09:25,787 --> 01:09:28,210
Jesus.
All right, hold still.

547
01:09:29,957 --> 01:09:33,177
It's easy for things
to get infected on a farm.

548
01:09:33,336 --> 01:09:34,963
Start falling off.

549
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:39,016
Pussy.

550
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:45,390
I'm out here and you're in the house.
We need a way to communicate.

551
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:49,527
There's a dinner bell in the barn.
You can ring that if someone's coming.

552
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:53,486
Dinner bell. We need buzzers
or walkies or something.

553
01:09:53,648 --> 01:09:55,742
I don't know what we've got,
but I'll look.

554
01:09:56,317 --> 01:09:57,944
Cid!

555
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:02,907
- How's the math coming?
- I want to help the man.

556
01:10:03,074 --> 01:10:05,873
Help him with what?
I could help him with my toys.

557
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:07,878
No. Let me talk to you.

558
01:10:08,788 --> 01:10:11,337
I need you to stay away
from that man. Okay?

559
01:10:11,499 --> 01:10:13,627
Let him do his thing,
but stick with me.

560
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:16,046
Okay?
Is he not good?

561
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:19,136
Well, we're gonna see
what he is. All right?

562
01:10:19,298 --> 01:10:21,517
But I need you
to stick with me.

563
01:10:21,676 --> 01:10:23,269
Good boy.

564
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:58,846
Shh.

565
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:13,854
Hand me that Phillips.

566
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:21,240
Tell me if you hear her coming.
What are we doing here?

567
01:11:21,402 --> 01:11:23,404
Commundication.

568
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:28,701
But I need to make it stronger.

569
01:11:28,868 --> 01:11:31,041
And how do we do that?
Bigger battery.

570
01:11:31,662 --> 01:11:33,255
Smart.

571
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:38,177
Do you kill people?

572
01:11:42,673 --> 01:11:45,426
Uh... Let's say I kill people.

573
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:47,766
With your gun?

574
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:49,556
Uh-huh.

575
01:11:51,516 --> 01:11:53,610
You want a gun like mine?
Yeah.

576
01:11:53,768 --> 01:11:57,898
What are you gonna do with it,
pole vaulting? It's bigger than you.

577
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:01,818
Stop bad things from happening.

578
01:12:04,362 --> 01:12:05,363
Shit!

579
01:12:20,586 --> 01:12:23,840
So how long you and your mom
been out here on the farm?

580
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:25,758
She's not.

581
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:28,143
She's not what?

582
01:12:29,095 --> 01:12:33,976
Sara doesn't know,
but I remember my real mom.

583
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:39,989
When I was a baby,
I couldn't stop it.

584
01:12:40,147 --> 01:12:42,070
Couldn't stop what?

585
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:46,446
I couldn't stop her from getting killed.

586
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:50,207
I saw it, but I couldn't stop it.

587
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:53,244
I wasn't strong enough.

588
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:57,753
You should, uh...

589
01:12:57,915 --> 01:13:03,888
You should talk to your mom about this.
She's not my mom. She's a liar.

590
01:13:17,768 --> 01:13:22,023
Spotted him coming out of a sewer tunnel
on the west end. He's on the run.

591
01:13:33,784 --> 01:13:36,833
<i>Think he's heading
to the west on Talbott Street,</i>

592
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:40,045
<i>possibly to Whore's Alley.
We have a visual.</i>

593
01:13:42,877 --> 01:13:45,926
You can't take that thing out
with a plow or something?

594
01:13:47,173 --> 01:13:48,550
Uh-huh.

595
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:52,265
Listen, I found a, uh...

596
01:13:53,763 --> 01:13:56,937
In the barn, I found some parts
and I made a thing.

597
01:13:58,559 --> 01:13:59,981
Here.

598
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:04,569
So if you see something,
just push that.

599
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:07,489
When?

600
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:13,033
Last night he woke me up.
Don't tell him I told you. He didn't...

601
01:14:17,954 --> 01:14:20,002
You said you were his morn.

602
01:14:21,499 --> 01:14:22,967
Yeah.

603
01:14:23,626 --> 01:14:25,503
He told me you're not.

604
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:28,722
He said that?

605
01:14:30,341 --> 01:14:31,718
Yeah.

606
01:14:32,593 --> 01:14:36,018
If he's not your son, who is he?
He's my son.

607
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:40,563
I had Cid when I was 22.

608
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:43,605
But I didn't want to give up
my life in the city.

609
01:14:43,771 --> 01:14:47,571
So I dropped him here on the farm
with my sister,

610
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:51,488
and she saw how I was living,
so she took him.

611
01:14:51,654 --> 01:14:54,908
And my sister, she raised him.

612
01:14:57,159 --> 01:15:01,005
She loved him.
He called her Morn.

613
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:08,880
How did she get killed?

614
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:10,506
Jesus Christ.

615
01:15:10,673 --> 01:15:12,846
He remembers it.
You've gotta talk to him.

616
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:16,479
I told you one thing.
I told you to stay away from my son.

617
01:15:16,637 --> 01:15:19,015
He asked about my gun.
Stay out of it!

618
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:21,521
And stay the fuck away from my son!

619
01:15:24,437 --> 01:15:28,658
Where does 56 go?

620
01:15:29,608 --> 01:15:32,282
Oh, good. You're smart.

621
01:15:32,611 --> 01:15:33,658
Twenty-one?

622
01:15:33,821 --> 01:15:35,994
How long can you not sleep?

623
01:15:36,157 --> 01:15:39,957
I don't know. Probably a while.
It's a good question.

624
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:42,247
Where does it go? Come on.

625
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:45,841
Good.

626
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,422
Thirty-two?

627
01:15:47,585 --> 01:15:50,589
You should help Joe watch.
Joe?

628
01:15:50,755 --> 01:15:53,008
Because he can't stay awake
all the time.

629
01:15:53,174 --> 01:15:55,802
Isn't our business. Okay?
He's keeping us safe.

630
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:57,641
Let's do this now, okay?

631
01:15:57,803 --> 01:16:00,602
You have 32 there.
I know you know this one.

632
01:16:03,726 --> 01:16:07,071
No. Eight times three is what?
Thirty-two.

633
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:09,277
Eight times three is what?

634
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:10,862
Thirty-two.

635
01:16:14,153 --> 01:16:19,375
I want you to count three eights.
Eight, sixteen...

636
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:22,040
thirty-two.

637
01:16:22,203 --> 01:16:24,422
You telling me you want alone time?
No.

638
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:27,379
Then why don't you put that
where it belongs?

639
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:35,174
Alone time.
He's protecting us

640
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:37,139
because you can't do it.

641
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:40,851
I told you to stay away from him, didn't I?
I never did anything.

642
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:42,890
Do you think I'm stupid?
So?

643
01:16:43,933 --> 01:16:45,526
I told Joe to leave...
So?!

644
01:16:45,684 --> 01:16:48,528
You do what I tell you!
You can't tell me what to do.

645
01:16:48,687 --> 01:16:50,109
You're not my mom!

646
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:52,274
You're not my mom! You're a liar!

647
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:55,194
You're gonna get killed
because you won't stop lying!

648
01:16:55,361 --> 01:16:57,739
Cid, calm down.
You're lying! I hate you!

649
01:16:57,905 --> 01:17:00,033
You're lying to me! I hate you!
Cid...

650
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:03,499
I hate you! Liar! You're lying!
Calm down. Calm down.

651
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:21,729
Liar!

652
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:24,686
Liar!

653
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:28,520
You're not my mom! You're a liar!

654
01:17:33,816 --> 01:17:35,534
You're not my mom!

655
01:17:35,693 --> 01:17:36,910
I hate you!

656
01:17:37,069 --> 01:17:38,571
Liar!

657
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:41,240
Liar! Liar!

658
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:16,484
I'm sorry.

659
01:18:18,986 --> 01:18:21,409
It's okay, sweetie.

660
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:09,836
Holy shit.

661
01:20:03,007 --> 01:20:04,304
Evening, ma'am.

662
01:20:05,509 --> 01:20:08,183
Evening. How can I help you?

663
01:20:08,512 --> 01:20:13,234
Ahem. You can start by accepting
my apologies re the hour.

664
01:20:13,392 --> 01:20:15,941
Hope I didn't catch you at supper.
That's fine.

665
01:20:16,103 --> 01:20:18,652
I've been walking
between empty farms all day.

666
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:21,158
Thought I'd just
tick this one off the list.

667
01:20:21,317 --> 01:20:24,070
Not have to come back tomorrow.
What's this about?

668
01:20:24,903 --> 01:20:26,826
You alone here, ma'am?

669
01:20:26,989 --> 01:20:28,866
My husband should be back any time.

670
01:20:29,033 --> 01:20:30,706
Happy to hear it.
Mm-hm.

671
01:20:34,038 --> 01:20:36,291
Could I trouble you for some water?

672
01:20:36,707 --> 01:20:39,756
I'll get you some.
You can take the glass with you.

673
01:20:39,918 --> 01:20:41,716
Actually, ma'am,

674
01:20:41,879 --> 01:20:45,679
my business today,
this ticking off the list business,

675
01:20:46,383 --> 01:20:49,478
is gonna require me coming in,
if that's all right.

676
01:20:49,636 --> 01:20:52,480
Will you tell me what this is about?
I will, yes.

677
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:57,441
Can I come in?

678
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:02,403
Ma'am?

679
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:14,336
I'm a deputized police officer,
looking for an escaped criminal.

680
01:21:15,329 --> 01:21:18,378
Anyone through here
in the past two days, vagrants?

681
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:21,214
Vagrants are always
passing, nobody near the house.

682
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:22,754
That man there?

683
01:21:23,504 --> 01:21:25,552
He's young. No.

684
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:29,514
We're looking for his father too.
Similar looking build, late 50s,

685
01:21:29,676 --> 01:21:32,179
may or may not be traveling together.

686
01:21:34,181 --> 01:21:35,899
Do you recognize them?

687
01:21:37,267 --> 01:21:39,941
No.
Keep them.

688
01:21:41,814 --> 01:21:43,816
Your kids with your husband?

689
01:21:45,651 --> 01:21:47,119
Yeah, just one.

690
01:21:47,277 --> 01:21:49,700
How old?
Ten.

691
01:21:49,863 --> 01:21:51,410
Ten...

692
01:22:11,802 --> 01:22:13,770
I'm gonna show you
the barn and house.

693
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:15,852
And then you can be on your way.

694
01:22:16,014 --> 01:22:19,609
I took the liberty
with your barn. Apologies.

695
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:23,564
So the house.

696
01:22:38,871 --> 01:22:41,374
Ten, you said? Your boy?
Yeah.

697
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:43,759
And your husband?
Mm-hm.

698
01:22:44,334 --> 01:22:47,554
I've just gotta check in
with the home office.

699
01:22:49,339 --> 01:22:52,593
The boy's in the city with his father.
When they getting back?

700
01:22:52,759 --> 01:22:54,352
Couldn't tell you.

701
01:22:58,223 --> 01:22:59,270
Ah.

702
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:02,110
This goddamn thing.

703
01:23:02,769 --> 01:23:05,898
I can never get a signal
this far out of town.

704
01:23:07,858 --> 01:23:10,031
Ah. Piece of shit.

705
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:17,910
Okay. Here we go.

706
01:23:18,869 --> 01:23:20,086
Is this man dangerous?

707
01:23:20,621 --> 01:23:24,501
He shoots men down for a living.
He's a stone-cold killer.

708
01:23:24,666 --> 01:23:27,795
My boss has half the city
looking for him.

709
01:23:27,961 --> 01:23:30,384
Half the city and me, so...

710
01:23:30,589 --> 01:23:33,058
And if you find him,
there's a hell of a price.

711
01:23:33,217 --> 01:23:36,767
Chunk of money like that,
you should think on it.

712
01:23:36,929 --> 01:23:40,149
I will.
All right. Show me upstairs.

713
01:23:42,809 --> 01:23:45,232
There's drafts in the house.

714
01:24:04,998 --> 01:24:08,593
My granddad built this tunnel
when the vagrant raids got bad.

715
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:12,218
- Nana said he was nuts.
- Thank you, Granddad.

716
01:24:12,381 --> 01:24:16,761
That wasn't the man.
No. It's funny. I know that guy, though.

717
01:24:16,927 --> 01:24:21,524
His name is Jesse.
I like him. He's good.

718
01:24:21,932 --> 01:24:24,481
He's gonna go away
once he doesn't find me.

719
01:24:24,643 --> 01:24:26,645
He won't hurt your morn.

720
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:29,990
Sara.
Where's your morn?

721
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:33,448
Where's my mom?

722
01:24:36,321 --> 01:24:40,872
She, uh, gave me up.
I was younger than you.

723
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:45,755
We were vagrants,
and she was alone.

724
01:24:47,249 --> 01:24:50,549
I thought she was stupid
for getting on the drugs she was on,

725
01:24:50,711 --> 01:24:54,215
but now I see she was
just so alone.

726
01:24:55,132 --> 01:24:56,975
It's what she had.

727
01:24:58,093 --> 01:25:00,767
She sold me
to a panhandle gang.

728
01:25:01,847 --> 01:25:05,101
I got away and I ran
and ended up on this train.

729
01:25:05,267 --> 01:25:07,816
I remember I was sitting there
in an empty car.

730
01:25:08,478 --> 01:25:10,480
And I saw myself
over and over again,

731
01:25:10,647 --> 01:25:15,403
killing those men that bought me,
that got my mom on what she was on.

732
01:25:15,569 --> 01:25:19,540
Just finding them and tearing them apart.
Saving my mom.

733
01:25:19,698 --> 01:25:20,950
But you didn't.

734
01:25:22,242 --> 01:25:24,995
No, a man in the city found me,
put a gun in my hand.

735
01:25:25,162 --> 01:25:26,960
Gave me something that was mine.

736
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:33,091
That's just men trying to figure out what they
would do to keep what's theirs, what they've got.

737
01:25:34,463 --> 01:25:36,886
That's the only kind of man there is.

738
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:40,098
I'm not gonna let Sara get killed.

739
01:25:51,438 --> 01:25:53,361
I think we're clear.

740
01:26:04,701 --> 01:26:06,544
Sara!

741
01:26:09,790 --> 01:26:11,508
Baby.

742
01:26:29,226 --> 01:26:31,570
All working girls, yeah?

743
01:26:31,728 --> 01:26:35,699
This whole block
and a couple of blocks over.

744
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:38,322
Hello, Joe.

745
01:26:38,485 --> 01:26:41,364
If you want to check those,
too, I can arrange.

746
01:26:45,701 --> 01:26:47,829
I'm an arranger, stranger.

747
01:26:47,994 --> 01:26:50,747
If you don't see
what you want to see, no refunds.

748
01:27:55,228 --> 01:27:56,525
What?

749
01:27:58,774 --> 01:28:00,321
What happened?

750
01:28:46,696 --> 01:28:49,040
That's pretty good.

751
01:28:51,576 --> 01:28:54,170
In the city, young guys would

752
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:58,630
hit on me
by floating fucking quarters.

753
01:28:58,792 --> 01:29:02,046
And I wouldn't tell them
I was TK,

754
01:29:02,212 --> 01:29:04,965
but I would keep
their quarters down.

755
01:29:05,257 --> 01:29:10,730
This one guy just busted a blood
vessel in his eye trying to get it up.

756
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:25,402
He's you.

757
01:29:26,027 --> 01:29:27,745
Your loop.

758
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:31,074
You lied to me.

759
01:29:32,742 --> 01:29:36,588
But I know you're not lying
when you say you're gonna kill this guy,

760
01:29:36,746 --> 01:29:38,794
your own self.

761
01:29:38,999 --> 01:29:42,048
You protected Cid
from that gat man.

762
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:43,803
Uh...

763
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:47,553
Yeah.
He saved your ass, didn't he?

764
01:29:47,716 --> 01:29:49,468
He saved my ass.
Yeah.

765
01:29:49,926 --> 01:29:51,599
He's a...

766
01:29:54,598 --> 01:29:56,271
He's a good kid.

767
01:29:56,433 --> 01:29:58,356
Yeah, he is.

768
01:30:01,104 --> 01:30:05,325
You know, when I came back,
after my sister died,

769
01:30:06,276 --> 01:30:08,995
I remember seeing him

770
01:30:09,863 --> 01:30:14,209
for the first time in two years,
just sitting on the porch.

771
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:19,461
I drove up crying. I'd been at this

772
01:30:19,623 --> 01:30:23,969
party all night in the city
when I got the call...

773
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:31,302
so I was wearing
this ridiculous party dress.

774
01:30:33,386 --> 01:30:36,230
All my ridiculous shit.

775
01:30:38,058 --> 01:30:40,527
And I don't know if he...

776
01:30:41,519 --> 01:30:44,318
even remembered me,

777
01:30:45,523 --> 01:30:47,946
but he looked at me...

778
01:30:54,115 --> 01:30:56,709
I abandoned him.

779
01:30:59,955 --> 01:31:02,674
I abandoned my baby.

780
01:31:07,337 --> 01:31:10,967
And I've seen so many men
in the city,

781
01:31:11,633 --> 01:31:15,729
who I look in their eyes
and they're just lost.

782
01:31:17,764 --> 01:31:20,358
So whether he loves me back or not,

783
01:31:22,227 --> 01:31:25,731
as long as I'm there to raise him,

784
01:31:26,856 --> 01:31:29,700
he's gonna be taken care of.

785
01:31:30,902 --> 01:31:33,530
He's gonna be safe.

786
01:31:35,323 --> 01:31:38,327
He's never gonna get lost.

787
01:32:00,390 --> 01:32:01,607
Hello, Joe.

788
01:32:03,268 --> 01:32:04,895
Jesse.

789
01:32:06,062 --> 01:32:09,737
Put this down and let her go.

790
01:32:10,734 --> 01:32:14,329
Sara, Jesse here is the best shot
with a gat that I know.

791
01:32:15,071 --> 01:32:18,871
When he lets you go, just sit on
the couch. Don't do anything stupid.

792
01:32:24,664 --> 01:32:27,588
He's coming here, Jess.
My loop is coming here.

793
01:32:27,751 --> 01:32:31,631
I gotta take you in.
I got 948 bars of pure silver.

794
01:32:31,796 --> 01:32:33,798
I close my loop,
I get right with Abe.

795
01:32:33,965 --> 01:32:36,434
Whatever he gives back,
I'll split it with you.

796
01:32:36,593 --> 01:32:38,140
Was that your plan?

797
01:32:39,262 --> 01:32:40,388
Okay, take all of it.

798
01:32:40,555 --> 01:32:43,229
Are you delusional?
You ain't getting right.

799
01:32:43,391 --> 01:32:47,942
Long as Abe's got one gat man standing
he's gonna hunt you till his dying day.

800
01:32:48,605 --> 01:32:51,654
We're gonna go now. Gonna get
in my truck and you're just gonna...

801
01:33:07,123 --> 01:33:08,841
I'm sorry.

802
01:34:11,479 --> 01:34:12,776
The Rainmaker...

803
01:34:36,296 --> 01:34:37,923
Cid!

804
01:34:38,089 --> 01:34:39,762
Cid!

805
01:34:40,633 --> 01:34:42,385
Oh, my God!

806
01:34:45,263 --> 01:34:47,265
Cid!

807
01:34:49,225 --> 01:34:50,818
Cid?

808
01:34:51,519 --> 01:34:55,114
It's him.
What is he, some TK freak?

809
01:34:55,899 --> 01:34:57,446
You knew.

810
01:34:59,986 --> 01:35:02,364
What are you doing?
How did your sister die?

811
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:06,034
What are you doing with those guns?
Is that what happened to her?

812
01:35:06,201 --> 01:35:07,748
No!
He kill her like that?

813
01:35:07,911 --> 01:35:11,290
No. He was climbing a bookshelf
and it fell back on him.

814
01:35:11,456 --> 01:35:13,925
He can get scared. It exploded.

815
01:35:14,083 --> 01:35:16,461
Jesus frigging...
He'll learn to control it.

816
01:35:16,628 --> 01:35:20,508
Imagine what he's gonna do!
If he did good with it, though.

817
01:35:20,673 --> 01:35:23,552
If he grew up
with me raising him.

818
01:35:23,718 --> 01:35:25,720
If he grew up good...

819
01:35:27,388 --> 01:35:28,389
He doesn't.

820
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:31,518
You stay away from him, Joe!

821
01:35:36,189 --> 01:35:40,319
Cid! Stay away from Joe, baby!

822
01:35:40,818 --> 01:35:42,786
Follow me, baby!

823
01:36:42,797 --> 01:36:44,765
Come to me. It's okay.

824
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:51,143
It's okay, baby.

825
01:36:53,850 --> 01:36:55,693
Right now two things have happened.

826
01:36:55,852 --> 01:36:58,196
My loop knows Cid's the kid
he's looking for.

827
01:36:58,354 --> 01:37:00,106
And my gang knows I'm here.

828
01:37:00,273 --> 01:37:04,153
That means in 15 minutes, one or both
of them is coming down that highway.

829
01:37:04,736 --> 01:37:07,455
Pack up the truck.
Take everything you can and go.

830
01:37:07,613 --> 01:37:10,116
Drive north away from the city.

831
01:37:10,783 --> 01:37:12,160
Thank you.

832
01:37:25,214 --> 01:37:27,216
Got everyone here, all our men.

833
01:37:27,383 --> 01:37:29,101
Arm them up. Let's go.

834
01:37:38,227 --> 01:37:39,900
<i>I got him, Abe. I got him.</i>

835
01:37:41,105 --> 01:37:43,608
Well, shit.

836
01:37:46,069 --> 01:37:47,912
That's right, motherfuckers.

837
01:37:48,363 --> 01:37:50,536
Whoa.
I got him.

838
01:37:50,698 --> 01:37:52,666
Knew he was sweet
on this one whore.

839
01:37:52,825 --> 01:37:55,123
I checked her building...
They found Joe

840
01:37:55,286 --> 01:37:58,916
in a farm on the east side.
That's why all the gat men are here.

841
01:37:59,082 --> 01:38:02,052
The whole crew is arming up
to make a sweep.

842
01:38:02,210 --> 01:38:03,553
Joe?

843
01:38:03,711 --> 01:38:06,760
Fuck Joe. Save your bullets!
I've got the loop!

844
01:38:07,382 --> 01:38:11,057
Not such a fuck-up now, huh?
I'm bringing him up to see Abe.

845
01:38:21,396 --> 01:38:22,613
Get this asshole!

846
01:38:25,358 --> 01:38:26,701
Motherfuckers!

847
01:39:38,806 --> 01:39:40,683
Holy shit.

848
01:39:47,690 --> 01:39:49,442
Joe!

849
01:39:51,235 --> 01:39:54,535
Guess I put the gun
in that kid's hand, huh?

850
01:39:57,200 --> 01:40:00,124
<i>I guess
everything comes back around.</i>

851
01:40:01,704 --> 01:40:04,082
Like your goddamn ties.

852
01:41:28,374 --> 01:41:31,799
Take this truck. And take your gold
and go live your life.

853
01:41:31,961 --> 01:41:35,682
Nobody's coming after you.
I fixed it.

854
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:38,093
You go kill the boy.
That how you fix it?

855
01:41:38,259 --> 01:41:40,853
You're goddamn right
I'm gonna kill that boy!

856
01:41:41,012 --> 01:41:44,061
You just got your life back.
My life?

857
01:41:44,223 --> 01:41:47,022
Your life. Becoming you.

858
01:41:47,184 --> 01:41:50,028
Goddamn it!
You've lost your fucking mind!

859
01:41:50,187 --> 01:41:54,033
You let this boy live, he's gonna
take everything you've got.

860
01:41:54,191 --> 01:41:56,068
And everything I got!

861
01:41:57,069 --> 01:42:00,118
See what he becomes.
I haven't seen that yet.

862
01:42:00,281 --> 01:42:01,783
Goddamn it!

863
01:42:53,542 --> 01:42:54,589
Shit.

864
01:42:54,752 --> 01:42:57,221
Okay, baby, we're going.

865
01:42:58,923 --> 01:43:00,516
Put your seat belt on.

866
01:43:27,201 --> 01:43:28,919
Stop.
Duck down. It's okay.

867
01:43:29,078 --> 01:43:31,706
- Stop, please. He can shoot us.
- Duck down.

868
01:43:31,872 --> 01:43:33,419
Stop!

869
01:43:33,582 --> 01:43:35,255
Stop! Stop! Stop!

870
01:43:57,064 --> 01:43:59,487
Cid.
I'm sorry.

871
01:43:59,650 --> 01:44:03,245
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm gonna get you down.

872
01:44:11,996 --> 01:44:15,375
Okay, we're going into the cane.
Go. Go.

873
01:44:21,756 --> 01:44:23,224
Go.

874
01:44:41,275 --> 01:44:42,527
No!

875
01:44:50,576 --> 01:44:53,375
No. Cid, no.

876
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:43,338
No!

877
01:45:48,592 --> 01:45:52,847
It's okay, baby. You're okay.

878
01:45:54,765 --> 01:45:56,893
It's okay, baby.

879
01:46:00,688 --> 01:46:02,782
It's okay.

880
01:46:02,940 --> 01:46:05,910
I love you. Calm down.

881
01:46:06,569 --> 01:46:08,617
Good boy.

882
01:46:10,614 --> 01:46:13,083
Mommy loves you.

883
01:46:15,786 --> 01:46:18,084
Mommy loves you.

884
01:46:19,373 --> 01:46:21,171
It's okay.

885
01:46:23,586 --> 01:46:25,429
Mom.

886
01:46:35,180 --> 01:46:36,602
Shit.

887
01:46:37,850 --> 01:46:41,400
Oh. Oh. You did good.

888
01:46:41,562 --> 01:46:43,781
You did so good. Good boy.

889
01:46:46,817 --> 01:46:49,912
Listen to me. I need you to run
into the fields now.

890
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:53,745
No, Mom, I don't want to leave you.
It's okay.

891
01:46:53,908 --> 01:46:56,161
- You need to go. Go!
- Move!

892
01:46:56,327 --> 01:46:58,204
Move, goddamn it!

893
01:47:15,137 --> 01:47:16,309
Move.

894
01:47:21,185 --> 01:47:22,687
<i>Then I saw it.</i>

895
01:47:26,941 --> 01:47:30,445
<i>I saw a mom
who would die for her son.</i>

896
01:47:32,613 --> 01:47:34,866
<i>A man who would kill for his wife.</i>

897
01:47:37,910 --> 01:47:40,208
<i>A boy, angry and alone.</i>

898
01:47:41,330 --> 01:47:44,209
<i>Laid out in front of him,
the bad path. I saw it.</i>

899
01:47:46,627 --> 01:47:48,174
<i>And the path was a circle...</i>

900
01:47:51,882 --> 01:47:53,759
<i>round and round.</i>

901
01:48:04,937 --> 01:48:06,234
<i>So I changed it.</i>

902
01:48:22,204 --> 01:48:23,797
Cid!

903
01:48:47,146 --> 01:48:48,648
Where's Joe?

904
01:48:50,482 --> 01:48:53,110
He had to go away, baby.
