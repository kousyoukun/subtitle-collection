1
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:06,307
No loopers in the club
on Wednesday, Joe.

2
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:08,513
- Gat men only.
- We'll stick backstage.

3
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:11,144
- Just meeting up.
- Packing your blunderbusses?

4
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:13,431
- Hardly. Right, Seth?
- I'm with Joe.

5
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:15,816
- Just meeting up, in and out.
- Go on.

6
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:50,176
Exactly. Come on.

7
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,680
No loopers on Wednesday, Joe.
Gat men only.

8
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,152
So I've read.

9
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:09,870
Hey, Joe.

10
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,948
Hey, Joe!

11
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,826
Are you kidding me?

12
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:26,258
<i>This job doesn't tend to attract
the most forward-thinking people.</i>

13
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,139
So we celebrating?

14
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:31,221
Yeah! Yeah!

15
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,886
No loopers on fucking Wednesdays.

16
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:37,431
Oh, yeah, Kid? Suck mine!

17
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,646
Fucking Kid Blue.

18
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,162
Hey!

19
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:26,481
And fucking stay out!

20
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,762
Look out!

21
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:57,599
Shit.

22
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,810
Fuck, Joe.

23
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,991
Holy shit.

24
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,410
- Don't.
- I'm bringing it out.

25
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,074
- Why?
- It's already brought!

26
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:22,290
What's the point of a flying bike
when you gotta wheel it out?

27
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,625
- It came on this thing.
- This is ridiculous.

28
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,131
No, no, no, Joe.

29
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,917
You ever had a girl
on the back of your bike...

30
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:32,054
...arms and legs
just wrapped around your body...

31
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,011
-...while you hit that throttle?
- No. Have you?

32
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:38,177
- No, but you can imagine.
- You ought to sell this thing, man.

33
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,846
- It's a lot of stupid money.
- Well, I got stupid money.

34
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,184
Okay.

35
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:45,271
<i>Stone-cold killer makin' stupid money
Stone-cold killer</i>

36
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:48,608
- Bullshit.
- Bull, fuck you, shit.

37
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,864
- Killer.
- Did you ever kill a man in the eye?

38
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:54,367
I mean, look him in his eye,
kill him?

39
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:56,904
As in turkey truss with a head sack?

40
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,993
We're not killers.

41
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,324
You know what? Thank Christ.

42
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,539
- Listen.
- I think I did something.

43
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:06,000
Now, listen.
Take Zach, what's his payout?

44
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:09,042
Like 3, 4K, if that? That's not enough
to last you 30 years.

45
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,880
- That won't get you overseas.
- Overseas?

46
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,090
Five, 10 years,
you're back to riding rails.

47
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,597
Or worse, you're like Kid Blue.

48
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,804
TKs are special. Fuck you!

49
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:22,597
You're Kid Blue, working as a gat man,
wagging your dick at loopers...

50
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,891
...roughing up shop clerks
for payoff money.

51
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,729
Fucking Kid Blue.

52
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,403
So listen.

53
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,236
You listening? Hey.

54
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,860
I'm gonna tell you again.
Save something.

55
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:38,988
Then that'll be yours.

56
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:41,998
And then you got yours
and that's all that matters.

57
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,750
Your life's your own.

58
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,246
I got mine...

59
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:50,090
...and you got yours.

60
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:55,383
I wish I was smart like you.

61
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,432
Saint Joe.

62
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,223
Get up. Come here.

63
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,196
<i>Two, Jed.</i>

64
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:28,333
Here's to the rest of my life.

65
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,213
Loop closed. Here we go.

66
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,500
What, fourth loop closed this month?

67
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,259
Fifth.

68
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,844
You wanna feel
these magic fingers, girl?

69
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:58,863
Hey, Suzie!

70
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,616
Sweetie, I've got to work.

71
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,835
Did you tell Joe about my kid?

72
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:56,091
No, I did not.

73
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:01,930
If he calls for me again,
I'm indisposed.

74
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,647
Sweep the train yard.

75
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:10,439
Every second that passes is bad.
Get on it.

76
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:12,778
Stupid little shit.

77
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,943
What? I can't hear you!

78
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,158
Well, that's what happens
when you fire a gat in a steel box...

79
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:21,416
...you stupid little shit!

80
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:25,749
I can fix this.

81
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,544
- I can find him!
- Go home.

82
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,648
Old man, begging for more time.

83
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:25,193
This is my life now. I earned it.
You had yours already.

84
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:30,081
So why don't you do what old men do
and die? Get the fuck out of my way.

85
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,413
Why don't you take your gun out
from between your legs and do it?

86
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,371
<i>BOY-</i>

87
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,380
It's all "never" and "anybody,"
and then you sit there...

88
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,216
...and you think
you're just gonna talk me into dying?

89
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:47,257
Well, bullshit. We both know
you're not gonna kill me.

90
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,930
Christ. You ordered eggs.

91
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,597
You know why
you're not gonna kill me?

92
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,891
When you're tasked
with the unthinkable...

93
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:59,937
...your mind will do anything
it possibly can to stop it.

94
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,064
To do the unthinkable
you gotta know why you're doing it.

95
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:07,111
Know in your bones, so you can say it
out loud to someone without apologizing.

96
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,950
Or else you can cut yourself off,
go numb.

97
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,915
But that path will kill you too.

98
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,295
It's hard staring into your eyes.

99
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,087
- It's too strange.
- Your face looks backwards.

100
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:31,510
Yeah. It helps, actually,
that little touch of unfamiliar.

101
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:34,475
You're not winning some contest
by staring at me in the eyes.

102
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,264
- I wasn't trying to.
- You didn't know what I looked like...

103
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,933
...until yesterday,
so it's easier for you.

104
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,274
So you know what's gonna happen?
You've done all this already?

105
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:45,235
I don't want to talk about
time travel shit.

106
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:48,493
If we start talking about it,
we're gonna be here all day.

107
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,449
Making diagrams with straws.

108
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:53,239
- It doesn't matter.
- I hurt myself, it changes your body.

109
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,626
- Does what I do change your memories?
- It doesn't matter!

110
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,261
My memory is cloudy.

111
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,184
It's a cloud.

112
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,730
It starts clear
and then it gets cloudy as I...

113
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,319
Goddamn it.

114
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,567
Give me those.

115
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,032
Just give me those and the pepper.

116
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:35,289
No, the salt. Just give me the salt.

117
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,626
Okay.

118
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,670
The span between these straws
is a timeline of the next 30 years.

119
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,509
The machine is tuned to a fixed time.
You know that.

120
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,390
Thirty odd years or so.
It's not adjustable.

121
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,222
This is the present moment
right now.

122
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,388
And this is the moment 30 years
from now when I was sent back.

123
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,556
See, my memories start clear here.

124
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:04,773
But as I go back they get cloudier
until they're totally obscured.

125
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,814
And the way it looks in my brain,
it's like a...

126
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,320
A fog.

127
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:13,236
Because my memories
aren't really memories.

128
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,824
They're just one possible
eventuality now.

129
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,707
And they grow clearer or cloudier
as they become more or less likely.

130
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:28,422
Then they get to the present moment,
and they're instantly clear again.

131
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,009
I can remember
what you do after you do it.

132
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,514
And it hurts.

133
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,853
So even when we're apart...

134
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,185
-...you can remember what I do after?
- Yes.

135
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:46,569
But this is a precise description
of a fuzzy mechanism.

136
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:47,774
It's messy.

137
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,689
Time travel fucks up everything.

138
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,608
My brain, my body.
They're just trying to catch up.

139
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,277
All I know-- I know two things.

140
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:58,619
I know what's happening in my head.
And I know that you're gonna meet her.

141
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,369
--Yourself.

142
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,047
No!

143
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:12,341
Let go of me!

144
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:14,380
Stop! Stop!

145
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:15,890
Stop!

146
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,551
Fuck you! Fuck you!

147
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:23,226
I'm gonna find him.
I'll make this good again, I will.

148
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:24,390
I'll be back.

149
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,398
Assholes!

150
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:29,608
Fuck all y'all!

151
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,444
I can fucking walk. I can walk!

152
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,745
No! No!

153
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,243
No!

154
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,079
No, no, no.

155
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,084
No. Listen. Listen!

156
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,211
No, please! No!

157
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,963
No.

158
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:51,752
No! No!

159
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,921
- Is he sick?
- Yup.

160
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,510
- Will he get better?
- Yeah.

161
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:43,928
- Promise?
- Just go to sleep, okay, baby boy?

162
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:51,102
- Night, sweetie.
- Night, Sara.

163
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:11,998
- You gotta help me.
- Jesus.

164
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:15,634
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.

165
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,353
Shit.

166
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:42,286
Water.

167
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:45,414
You drink that all night,
more than you think you want.

168
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:47,200
Bucket.

169
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,868
Aim for the bucket.

170
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:51,420
Don't chew your tongue off.

171
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,126
In the morning, we're gonna talk.

172
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,328
Okay.

173
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:29,075
Time travel hasn't been invented yet...

174
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:33,667
...but in 30 years, it will have been.
It's gonna be used by these criminal--

175
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,547
You're a looper?

176
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,733
Your name's Daniel, right?

177
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,114
How come you're not sitting
with the other kids at the party?

178
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,275
I'm fixing my car.

179
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:10,666
You have a birthday coming up.

180
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,952
In July.

181
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,629
We were gonna go to the lake.

182
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:18,291
I don't think we are now.

183
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:24,714
Sorry

184
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:43,365
I can't go back to the city
because Abe, the boss...

185
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:47,995
...his men will be searching for me 24/7
until they find me. Or find him.

186
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:49,579
All I've got is that map.

187
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,256
They flip it right over,
then they drag it...

188
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:01,383
...across to the branding fire,
you know?

189
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:05,672
- What are they doing to this cow?
- In this one, they're lifting it with a--

190
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:34,625
<i>Think he's heading to the west
on Talbott Street...</i>

191
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:37,878
<i>...possibly to Whore's Alley.
We have a visual.</i>

192
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,074
Yeah.

193
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,671
Hey, Can.

194
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:26,760
- Can!
- Jesus!

195
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:31,260
Fucking Kid Blue! What the fuck?

196
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,767
- Pull into that alley.
- Get the fuck out of my car!

197
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:37,521
You don't wanna be seen with me,
Canady. Now, pull into that alley.

198
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:44,270
What are you still doing here?
Abe wants you dead, man.

199
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,279
All Abe wants right now is a looper.

200
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:49,282
- Unless you got him last night.
- No, we did not get him.

201
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,159
- Spotted and lost him.
- Where?

202
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,116
West end near Whore's Alley.

203
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,577
Whore's Alley.

204
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,705
You should have left town, man.

205
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,124
No, I'm gonna bring him in.

206
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:06,925
Get right with Abe.

207
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:09,136
Maybe, you bring him the looper.

208
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:12,298
Short of that,
Abe don't get right with priced men.

209
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:14,975
Abe put a price on me?

210
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,056
Big one.

211
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,436
I'd never turn a friend for a price.

212
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:41,919
You can't take that thing out
with a plow or something?

213
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,342
Listen, I found a...

214
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:53,465
In the barn, I found some parts
and I made a thing.

215
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,974
Here.

216
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:18,368
- Drafty house.
- It's a farmhouse.

217
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:27,960
What's down there?

218
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,545
It's a laundry room.

219
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,928
The door must have blown open.
I don't know.

220
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,803
Two things.

221
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,893
First, I got a family of my own
back in the city.

222
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,148
I wanna see them again.

223
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,648
Second, if something happens to me...

224
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,905
...and I don't report back to my
boss people in 15 minutes...

225
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,320
...they'll know I disappeared
searching this house.

226
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:57,487
And inside of another 15,
you're gonna have an army of me's...

227
00:28:57,653 --> 00:29:00,247
...kicking down your door. Okay?

228
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:02,666
It's a laundry room.

229
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:21,348
You wanna call out whoever's
hiding in the hamper?

230
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,686
If someone was hiding in the house,
that's what I'd do...

231
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,350
...but nobody's in the house.

232
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,854
- You wanna open it up?
- No.

233
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:37,572
I think I'll just put a shot through it
just to be safe.

234
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:41,829
You wanna call them out?

235
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:07,560
If you promise not to wag your gun
at my shoe rack...

236
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:10,567
...I'll show you upstairs,
then I'll show you the fuck out.

237
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:37,841
My granddad built this tunnel
when the vagrant raids got bad.

238
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,882
--Arranger, stranger.

239
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:44,802
If you don't see
what you want to see, no refunds.

240
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,899
...I'd do anything.

241
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,643
Anything?

242
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,676
What would you give up for me
that's yours?

243
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,644
Don't wake up your daughter.
Sit down.

244
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,451
You don't know who I am?

245
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,488
No.

246
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:03,796
Hello, Joe.

247
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,011
Jesse.

248
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:10,427
I threw away this gun once.

249
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:15,183
I was gonna do it again now
because I know she'd want me to.

250
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:20,317
But then I saw her vanish.

251
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:24,529
Put this down and let her go.

252
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:29,110
Sara, Jesse here is the best shot
with a gat that I know.

253
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:33,622
When he lets you go, just sit on
the couch. Don't do anything stupid.

254
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:39,499
Then if I picked up this gun...

255
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:44,465
Life, my life, given back to me...

256
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,171
...just like it was before.

257
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:51,215
And she would never know
what I did to get it back.

258
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:55,052
He's coming here, Jess.
My loop is coming here.

259
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:59,064
- I gotta take you in.
- I got 948 bars of pure silver.

260
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,224
I close my loop, I get right with Abe.

261
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:03,898
Whatever he gives back,
I'll split it with you.

262
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,528
Was that your plan?

263
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:07,777
Okay, take all of it.

264
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,567
Are you delusional?
You ain't getting right.

265
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:15,246
Long as Abe's got one gat man standing
he's gonna hunt you until his dying day.

266
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:18,496
Everything fixed...

267
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,874
...through this sacrifice.

268
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,915
- I'm sorry.
- No.

269
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:32,264
We're gonna go now. Gonna get
in my truck and you're just gonna...

270
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:42,808
Lost his signal five minutes ago.
He's there.

271
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,648
Call everyone.
Every gat man in the city.

272
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:49,360
Gather them all here first.
No mistakes this time.

273
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:52,867
I'm gonna take an army
to that farmhouse all at once.

274
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:57,156
Sweep it like hellfire. Now.
