00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,800
热成像能清晰 看到他们在移动

00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,840
我们再靠近一些

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,800
这是美国边境巡逻队

跪下 举起你们的双手

把手放在头顶！

把手放在头顶！ 把手放在头顶！

22
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,830
把手放！

请注意
Be advised.

24

发生爆炸
There's been an explosion.

00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,170
祈祷毯

亲爱的 是的

31
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,800
和我一起待在这里
Stay here with me. Just stay here.

32
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,110
没事的
It's okay.

33
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,120
跟我一起慢慢的走
Just come with me slowly and quietly.

34
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,680
跟我待在一起 天啊
Stay here with me. Stay... Oh, God.

35
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,950
你不要这么做
You don't have to do this.

36
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,430
别这么做 求你了
You don't have to do this, please.

37
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,000
今晚的堪萨斯城充满了
The scene in Kansas City tonight

38
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,910
恐惧、困惑和悲伤
is one of horror, confusion and grief.

39
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,180
15个伤亡者其中有两个孩子
15 people, among them two children,

40
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,440
到目前为止已经确认死亡
还有更多的人受伤 .

41
00:05:58,610 --> 00:05:59,960
受害者家属依然在现场哭喊
The victims' families remain...

42
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,750
监视器画面中显示攻击者
Haunting images of the attackers

43
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,320
令人难以置信的袭击行为
are coming to light from surveillance...

44
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,930
国防部长詹姆斯莱利
Secretary of Defense James Riley

45
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,620
将对袭击事件发表声明
is expected to make a statement on the attacks.

46
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,190
我们高度关注事件进展并救助伤者
Our intense focus on recovery and assisting the injured

47
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,280
以及那些在事件中失去亲人的民众
and the families of those who have been killed

48
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,500
我们要坚定意志 并有决心
is matched only by our determination

49
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,240
防止更多可能的恐怖攻击
to prevent more attacks.

50
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,550
我们想对这些恐怖份子说
A message to our attackers.

51
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,950
你的炸弹不会吓倒我们
Your bombs do not terrify us.

52
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,950
它们赋予我们力量
They empower us.

53
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,430
我们将会加倍奉还
They empower us to send you something

54
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,830
令你们胆寒的：
that is truly terrifying:

55
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,260
美国军队的全部武力
the full weight of the United States military.

56
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,170
{\an8}索马利亚海湾

57
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,140
趴下 趴在地上！
Down, down, down on the ground!

58
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,370
为什么抓我？
No! Here for what?!

59
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,980
我不是战士！
I'm not the f-fighter!

60
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,280
战士！
Fighter!

61
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:45,730
{\an8}纳慕尔营地 吉布地

62
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,730
还好吗？
How you doing?

63
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,660
你觉得我是要对你用水刑吗 巴希米尔？
You think I'm gonna waterboard you, Bashiir?

64
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:43,620
水刑是我们不能虐待时才用
Waterboarding is when we can't torture.

65
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,060
这是非洲
This is Africa.

66
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,630
我他妈的可以为所欲为
I can do whatever the fuck I want here.

67
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:56,290
你得回答我问你的每一个问题
You're gonna answer every question I ask you

68
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,510
而且不用我伤你一根毫毛
without me harming a hair on your head.

69
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,860
知道为什么吗？
Do you want to know why?

70
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,860
因为如果你不
Because if you don't...

71
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:14,260
我只要打通电话 你家就会被空袭
...I'm gonna call in an air strike on your house.

72
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,480
还有 游泳池真不赖
Nice pool, by the way.

73
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,490
犯罪怎么会没有代价
Whoever said crime doesn't pay

74
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,620
你以为不抢油轮就没事？
wasn't stealing oil tankers, were they?

75
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:45,640
那些人是叶门人
Those men are Yemeni.

76
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,250
我们和那事毫无关系
We have nothing to do with that.

77
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:51,950
你们要找的是伊斯兰国 而不是我
Your fight is with ISIS, not me.

78
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,130
我们只在海上打仗
All my fights are on water.

79
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,300
当然了 巴希米尔
They sure are, Bashiir.

80
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,350
说到叶门？
And Yemen?

81
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,920
就在海湾对面
Just across the gulf.

82
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,660
真巧啊
What a coincidence.

83
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:17,020
现在如果叶门的民族主义者
It's kind of tricky for Yemeni nationalists

84
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:20,980
想预定个国际航班去美国 谈何容易？
to book an international flight these days, huh?

85
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,330
所以 假设他们能拿着假护照 蒙混过关
So, if their passports were fake,

86
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,460
直接就飞到了堪萨斯城
they'd fly straight to Kansas City

87
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,030
而不是去100多英里外的墨西哥
instead of going to Mexico and hiring coyotes to truck them

88
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,990
去雇用偷渡车来运送他们 是吧？
a hundred miles to the desert, right?

89
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,780
所以 最大的问题是：
他们是怎么到墨西哥的？
So, the big question is: how'd they get to Mexico?

90
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,820
因为他们铁定不能搭飞机
'Cause they sure as hell didn't fly.

91
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:45,870
所以 他们是坐船到达墨西哥的
No, they... traveled by ship.

92
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,960
一艘你没去抢劫的船
A ship you didn't try and steal.

93
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:52,490
这代表有人付钱 叫你别抢
So that means someone paid you not to.

94
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:56,710
所以我唯一的问题 巴希米尔
So, here's my only question, Bashiir.

95
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,450
谁付钱给你 让船安全通过的？
Who paid you to let the ship through?

96
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,700
那是你的兄弟吗？
Is that your brother?

97
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,440
因为我不想措杀了泳池管理员
'Cause I don't want to kill the pool guy.

98
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,190
每一艘船都在走私人口
Every ship smuggles people.Mm-hmm.

99
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,800
他们不需要我的许可
And they don't need my permission.

100
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,410
是的 他们他妈的需要
Yes, they fucking do.

101
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:50,290
最后的机会
Last chance.

102
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,550
你是在吓唬我
This is a bluff.No.

103
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,290
你是美国人
You American.

104
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:58,380
你有太多规则要遵守
You have too many rules.[DIALING]

105
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,380
今天没有规则 下个命令就行
No rules today, sport, just orders.

106
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,950
干吧 你可以行动了
DISPATCHER: Go ahead, sir.You're green.

107
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,650
收到
DISPATCHER: Roger that.

108
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,520
不要
No, no, no, no, no.

109
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,960
你得好好看着
No, I want you to watch it. I want you to watch it.

110
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,700
看着
Watch.

111
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,070
你有一个大家庭 巴希米尔
You have a big family, Bashiir.

112
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,900
很多兄弟
Lots of brothers.

113
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,380
你应该选择另一种工作
You should've chosen another line of work.

114
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,130
我可以这样搞上一整天都
I could do this all day.

115
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,260
但迟早
But sooner or later,

116
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:52,000
我会搞到你连一个兄弟都没有
I'll get the brother you can't live without.

117
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,960
我保证
I promise.

118
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,570
还有一件事情指向
It's one more thing

119
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,100
马塔莫罗斯贩毒集团
pointing to the cartels.

120
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,010
现在这些钱来自于
卡西姆阿尔-雷米的营地
Now, the money came from Quassim Al-Raymi's camp,

121
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,620
这倒不令人意外
which isn't a surprise.

122
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,280
另一方面 这艘船
The ship, on the other hand,

123
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,670
是一艘巴拿马货轮 拉维托利纳号
is a Panamanian freighter, La Victorina,

124
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,760
注册于墨西哥控股公司杜罗集团名下
registered to the Mexican holding company Grupo Duro.

125
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:16,940
它于18日停靠在韦拉克鲁斯港
It docked at Port of Veracruz on the 18th.

126
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,850
卡洛斯雷耶斯的公司
Carlos Reyes' company.

127
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,990
仅此一艘
The one and only.

128
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,380
如果你需要麦特回国
If you need Matt home,

129
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,600
我明早六点就能把他送回去
I can get him out at 0600 tomorrow.

130
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,990
我现在要飞去华盛顿
I'll have a plane to Washington

131
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,860
一小时后飞机准备好
ready for you in an hour.

132
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,780
明天见 麦特
See you tomorrow, Matt.[LINE CLICKS]

133
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:35,300
偷渡恐怖份子
在我看来 是很短视的行为
Smuggling terrorists seems pretty short-sighted to me.

134
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,310
边境现在查的很紧
Border's gonna tighten like a vice now.

135
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,830
911之后古柯碱的价格怎么样 肯？
What happened to the price of cocaine after 9/11, Ken?

136
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:44,140
紧绷的边界对偷渡生意有好处

00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,040
要我去接你吗？
Do you want me to pick you up?

142
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,470
我坐公车 好的
I'll take the bus. Okay.

143
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,130
我们走吧
Let's go.

144
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,010
非常好
It's pretty good.

145
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,320
他们一天赚多少？
How much they make?

146
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,540
把风吗？
For lookout?

147
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,370
20 30元一天吧
20, 30 a day.

148
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,070
表弟 他们就值这么多了
Man, but that's all they're worth.

149
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,550
但是你
But you...

150
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:35,990
你熟悉这条河的两边
well, shit, you know both sides of the river.

151
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,380
你有护照 来去自如
You got a passport. Come and go as you please.

152
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,610
拉法！
Rafa!

153
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,000
把我介绍给你表妹 混蛋

154
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,740
免谈 宅男

155
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,660
你认识他？

156
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,050
是的
Eh.

157
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,280
他表妹屁股很大 翘臀

158
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:06,800
发生了什么事？
What's going on?

159
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,330
把啤酒藏起来
Hide the beer.

160
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,430
你可以自己出个价 知道吧
You can name your own price, you know.

161
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,730
怎样？
Hmm?

162
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,170
这是边境
This is the border.

163
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:30,170
马塔莫罗斯贩毒集团
给大家提供了很好的工作赚钱机会
The Matamoros Cartel pay people well to work it.

164
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:37,490
你可以
You can, uh...

165
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,840
和我一起发财吧 表弟
start making your earn with me, cousin.

166
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,230
拿着
Take it.

167
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,250
这是你的
It's yours.

168
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,700
那么我该怎么做？
So, what do I have to do?

169
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:26,710
麦特 你真的应该涂点防晒乳
You really ought to invest in a little sunscreen, Matt.

170
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,890
如果你们在多云的地方发动战争
If you guys would start wars someplace cloudy,

171
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,450
我就不需要了
I wouldn't have to.

172
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:39,420
司法部确认了其他自杀式炸弹袭击者的身份？
DOJ get an ID on those other suicide bombers?

173
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:42,250
还没有 可能还正调查
Not yet.Uh, might want to get on that.

174
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,030
有证据显示雷耶斯贩毒集团
There's proof Reyes Cartel

175
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,690
帮助他们其中的一人到达边境 所以
helped one of them get to the border, so...

176
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,470
我们知道的 足以进行下一步
we know enough to move forward.

177
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,780
部长先生
Mr. Secretary...

178
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,690
麦特 格拉弗
Matt Graver.

179
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,740
坐吧
Have a seat.

180
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:13,930
你认为对于跨越我们国界的
贩毒集团来说
What do you think is the most valuable commodity

181
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,980
最有价值的商品是什么？
that cartels move across our borders?

182
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,680
20年前 古柯碱
20 years ago, cocaine.

183
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:24,110
今天我得说是人
Uh, today I'd have to say it'd be people.

184
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:27,510
这是一种他们不需要培养或处理的资源
It's a resource they don't have to cultivate or process

185
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,030
就算一次没有越境成功
and if they don't make it across,

186
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,380
他们可以再次付钱重来
they can pay to cross again

187
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,080
价格行情是一公斤货得的三倍
at three times the price of a kilo.

188
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:38,300
你如何定义恐怖主义 格拉弗先生？
How would you define terrorism, Mr. Graver?

189
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,780
我想这是你的工作 先生
I think that's your job, sir.

190
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:47,050
目前的定义是"任何个人或团体"
The current definition is "Any individual or group

191
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,270
用暴力来达到一个政治目的
that uses violence to achieve a political goal."

192
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:53,060
政府现在认为
The administration believes that

193
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,840
贩毒集团很符合这个定义
the drug cartels now fit that definition.

194
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,020
下个星期 总统将把贩毒集团
Next week, the president's adding drug cartels

195
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:01,590
也列入恐怖组织的名单
to the list of terrorist organizations.

196
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,410
你可以理解成这可以增加
You can understand how that will

197
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:06,330
我们打击他们的强度
expand our ability to combat them.

198
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,030
贩毒恐怖集团之间
The cartel territories

199
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,290
现在算是相当稳定
are fairly stable at the moment,

200
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,940
但正如我们在伊拉克学到的
but as we learned in Iraq,

201
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,560
如果能让他们鹬蚌相争
striking your enemy is a whole hell of a lot easier

202
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,120
我们就更容易打击他们
if they're fighting each other.

203
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,040
你需要什么 我就做什么
I'll do whatever you need.

204
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,390
给我指条路就行
Just point the way.

205
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,700
你有什么想法吗？
Do you have any thoughts?

206
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:30,880
我的意思是 我不会干掉一个贩毒集团头目
I mean, I wouldn't take out a cartel leader.

207
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,310
然后把一个贩毒集团分裂成50个
Turn one cartel into 50.

208
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:36,230
再说 杀死国王
并不会发动毒贩之间战争 而是结束
Besides, killing kings doesn't start wars, it ends them.

209
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,320
那是我们的事
That's our concern.Mm-hmm.

210
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,580
你有雷耶斯的具体位置吗？
You have a location on Reyes?

211
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,890
没有 但我们正在监控他的家庭
No, but the family's under surveillance.

212
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,670
他和他们之间有联络吗？
Is he in contact with them?

213
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:48,110
没有 但我们假设有联系
Not to our knowledge, but we assume yes.

214
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:51,110
-有孩子吗？
-两个
Any kids?Two.

215
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:52,510
最小的几岁？
What's the age of the youngest?

216
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,900
十六岁
Sixteen.

217
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,340
十六岁？
Sixteen?

218
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:02,870
如果你想发动一场战争
Yeah, if you want to start a war...

219
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,300
先绑架王子
kidnap a prince.

220
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,560
国王就会开战
King will start it for you.

221
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,740
你在中东做过这样的事情
You did this sort of thing in the Middle East.

222
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,270
嗯
Hmm.

223
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,880
你觉得这种策略在这里有用吗？
You think those tactics will work here?

224
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:20,190
只要你想这么做 先生
If you want it to, sir.

225
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,640
人员部署方面 你得雇用外面的人
Boots on the ground, you're gonna hire on the outside.

226
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:35,290
包括后勤车辆
And the same goes for your supply train

227
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,380
以及空中支援
and for air support.

228
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,640
我不需要提醒你
And I don't need to remind you

229
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,990
如果他们发现幕后是我们 后果会怎样
what happens if they figure out that it's us.

230
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,820
要讲明白的是
Just to be clear,

231
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,520
你想要让这件事情成功
you want to see this thing through,

232
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,700
那我必须 干肮脏工作
I'm gonna have to get... dirty.

233
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:01,230
干肮脏工作就是你来这里的原因
Dirty is exactly why you're here.

234
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,670
你需要什么？
What do you need?

235
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,240
一切
Everything.

236
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,500
具有攻击能力的无人机
Drones with attack capability...

237
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,540
你有黑鹰 对吧
You have Black Hawks, right?Mm-hmm.

238
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,980
我要两架 我需要后勤
I want two of those. I need logistics,

239
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,250
与特种作战司令部相容的通讯设备
communications equipment compatible with a SOCOM JCU.

240
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,250
第一阶段 我需要一支突击队
First phase, I need a strike team,

241
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,690
两个狙击手 还有爆破小组
two snipers, I need a demolition team...

242
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,510
你要去乌克兰吗？
Are you going to Ukraine?[CHUCKLES]

243
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:27,300
兄弟 我有俄罗斯人还在薪水单上
I got Russians on the payroll, brother.

244
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,040
别把我至于这种位置上
Don't put me in that position.

245
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,870
行动位置在哪里？
Where's the coup?

246
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,780
这是一次抽取行动
It's an extraction...

247
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,050
开始是这样
for starters.

248
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,480
我能知道多少？
How much can I know?

249
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:41,180
兄弟 你不会想知道的
Brother, you don't want to know.

250
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,580
好吧 我不需要知道细节
Well, I don't need specifics,

251
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,750
但我得知道他们要去哪里
but I have to know where they're going.

252
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,800
墨西哥
Mexico.

253
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:55,720
你一定是来开玩笑的
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

254
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:57,630
不是针对政府
It's not the government.

255
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,460
而是针对贩毒集团
It's cartel.

256
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,680
财政部在哪里付款？
Treasury cutting the checks?

257
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,250
在巴西的一家叫做力拓的公司
Eh, under a company in Brazil called Rio Verde.

258
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,740
只要一切开始运行
If it's constant action,

259
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:19,480
我就得负责每月1000万的薪水补给
I'm ten mil a month in payroll and supplies.

260
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:22,130
这是最少的
At least.

261
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:26,050
我要1500万的费用和豁免权
I want 150 over cost and immunity.

262
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,100
成交
Done.

263
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:33,490
恭喜你 现在你可以有个自己的曲棍球队了
Congratulations, you can afford your own hockey team now.

264
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:38,110
{\an8}波哥大 哥伦比亚

265
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:46,450
{\an8}我在你屋里等你 别他妈开枪打我

266
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,430
在圣诞节买东西会容易些
You'll be easy to shop for at Christmas.

267
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,210
我从不庆祝圣诞节
I don't celebrate Christmas.

268
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,480
好吧 我打赌你今年一定会庆祝
Well, I bet you will this year.

269
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,310
他们做了什么？
What'd they do?

270
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,050
不重要
Doesn't matter.

271
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,490
这次行动没有规则
No rules this time.

272
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:30,850
你可以放轻松的干
I'm turning you loose.

273
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,630
放多轻松？
How loose?

274
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:39,240
卡洛斯 雷耶斯
Carlos Reyes.

275
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,640
怎样 够轻松吧？
How's that for loose?

276
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:49,470
这是你为家人报仇的好机会
It's your chance to get even for your family.

277
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:58,740
你要帮我们发动一场战争
You're gonna help us start a war.

278
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,830
对谁？
With who?

279
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,530
所有人
Everyone.

280
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:16,150
{\an8}墨西哥城

281
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,050
Aah! Aah...

282
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:54,490
Aah!

283
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,550
戴上

284
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,440
再见了
Adios.

285
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:36,970
迪亚兹是马塔莫罗斯集团的律师

286
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:40,970
官方怀疑他被其他贩毒集团杀害

287
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:44,970
他们担心进一步的报复行动会展开

288
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,120
进而发动新的毒贩之间的战争

289
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:07,220
等她到家再行动会更好些
This would have been a lot easier taking her in the house.

290
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:10,610
在街上显得很草率
Could get real sloppy on the street.

291
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,270
草率点更好
Sloppy's good.

292
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,880
草率点让它看起来像是其它贩毒组织干的
Sloppy makes it look like the cartel did it.

293
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,670
好吧 开始行动
All right, let's go.

294
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:55,570
我要杀了你

295
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:59,720
你这臭婊子

296
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,550
看什么看？

297
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,940
是她先动手的
She started it.

298
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:16,030
雷耶斯小姐？
Miss Reyes?

299
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,340
她骂我是妓女 打我耳光 所以我才揍了她
She called me a narco whore and slapped me, so I hit her.

300
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,910
换成你会怎么做？
What would you do?

301
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,910
你
You.

302
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,950
去找护士
Go to the nurse.

303
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,440
不 你哪里也别去
No, you're not going anywhere.

304
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:35,440
坐下
Sit.

305
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,930
现在我要怎么处理你？
Now what am I going to do with you?

306
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:49,360
她罪有应得
She deserved what she got.

307
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,280
这地方不是你说了算
It's not your place to do it.

308
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:53,800
好吧
Fine.

309
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,680
那你去揍她一顿
You beat the shit out of her.

310
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:00,200
我真应该开除你
I should expel you.

311
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,420
开除啊
Do it.

312
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,220
我也是这么想的
That's what I thought.

313
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:35,020
看到什么了？
How we looking?

314
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:37,500
看到目标了吗？
Got eyes on the prize?

315
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,460
收到
Roger.

316
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,850
目标在后面一辆车上
Prize is in the tail vehicle.

317
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,500
什么情况

318
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,690
怎么没有网路连接了

319
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,990
检查一下你的手机信号

320
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,600
没信号

321
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,530
加速前进

322
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,190
不！
No!

323
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,980
不！不！不！
No! No! No!

324
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,060
告诉你们老板卡洛斯 雷耶斯

325
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,060
这就是马塔莫罗斯集团应得的

326
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:04,170
-我们去哪里？-直接上飞机
Where we going?Go straight to the plane.

327
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,650
不用管车 我们会处理
Don't worry about the vehicle. We'll take care of it.

328
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:06,910
好的
All right.

329
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:16,700
你要开车去购物中心
All right, you're gonna drive that to the mall.

330
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,440
钥匙放在加油盖上 就留在那里
Keys are in the gas flap. You just leave them there.

331
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:22,270
然后你去看看有什么在等着你
All right. Then you go see what's waiting for you.

332
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:33,690
{\an8}柯伯克里斯帝 德州 美国海军机场

333
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:01,070
-我们接下来去哪里？-5号楼 先生
Where you got us?Building 5, sir.

334
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,070
-你得往左走 -我知道怎么过去
You're gonna take a left.I know where it is.

335
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,530
现在让我们好好看看
Now walk me through what I'm watching here.

336
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:33,190
这是一张在100英里网格的墨西哥地图
This is a map of Mexico on a hundred-mile grids.

337
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,140
你在这里接到的目标
And you took the subject here.

338
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,710
据推测 雷耶斯有个住所
Speculation is Reyes has a family residence

339
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:40,580
在蒙特雷附近
somewhere near Monterrey.

340
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,800
墨西哥警方有什么消息？
Has the Mexican police responded yet?

341
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,810
有的 地方 州和联邦警察都到了现场
Yeah, local, state and federal police are all there now.

342
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:48,510
卫星无法获取手机信号
Satellite cannot pick up cell chatter.

343
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,380
但我们可以锁定目标座标
Okay.Yeah, we can lock coordinates

344
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,210
之后抓取电话号码
to the cell and snag the phone number,

345
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,250
但我们听不到电话内容
but we can't hear the call.

346
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:56,730
给我墨西哥城房子的卫星信号
Give me a satellite feed of the house in Mexico City.

347
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,730
是的 已切换
Yeah, you got it.

348
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:00,910
希望这个地方打出电话
What we're hoping for is a call from this location

349
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,870
我们就可以追踪电话
to start a trail.

350
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,040
房子里有家庭成员吗？
Any family members in the house?

351
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,570
没有 只是工作人员
No, just staff.

352
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:08,660
拥有30个豪宅房间的少女
Teenage girl with her own 30-room mansion.

353
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:11,960
真希望我是那个少女
I wish I was a teenage girl.

354
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:14,010
播放现场影像
Pull up the incident site.

355
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:20,410
看来你把他们都干掉了
It looks like you popped them all.

356
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,630
不对 我们只撂倒一个
No, we only engaged one.

357
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,240
一个是死于车祸 另外两个人被绑起来
One died in the crash, and the other two we tied and left.

358
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,460
冒这么大的风险 为什么？
That's a pretty big risk. Why do that?

359
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:30,500
想看看他们什么反应
Just to see what they'd do.

360
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,980
倒回去 看看之前的录影
Back it up. Show me earlier.

361
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,460
从我们离开的那时候开始
A minute just after we left.Yeah.

362
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,640
前进一些
Keep going.

363
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,430
从这里开始 很好
All right, there, good.

364
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,780
我们有新的音讯进入监视器手机
We have new audio coming in on the black phone.

365
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,920
收到
Copy that.

366
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:11,460
电话不是从房子里面打来的
Call is not coming from the house,

367
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,630
是从那个混蛋那里
it's coming from that fucker right there.

368
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:15,290
即时监听 并找到他
Give me a live feed and find him.

369
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,290
马上
On it.

370
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,900
电话！
Phone!

371
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,730
锁定它
Lock in on it.

372
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,990
好了 现在已锁定
All right, locking now.

373
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,520
数据已连接 这是国王
Data link up.There's the king.

374
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:31,170
就是这个 开始追踪
There it is. Start tracking.

375
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,310
快点
Come on.

376
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,780
两秒后开始
Tracking on two.

377
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,530
稍等 三秒
Stand by. We got three.

378
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,700
求你不要伤害我

379
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:19,480
求你了
Por favor.

380
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,920
你想把我怎么样

381
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,190
求你了
Por favor.

382
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:46,720
如果你放了我

383
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:49,160
我什么都不会说 我发誓

384
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,210
渴了就自己喝点水

385
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:54,430
我发誓 求你了

386
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,740
趴下！警察！趴下！
Get down!Police! Get down!

387
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,220
把手举起来 快！
Hands where I can see 'em!Move! Move!

388
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,490
安全！
Clear!

389
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,750
安全！
Clear!

390
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:23,950
这还有一个人！
We got another one here!

391
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,570
你没事吧？
A-Are you okay?

392
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:33,270
安全了吗？
Are we clear?

393
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,790
安全！
All clear!

394
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:38,270
没事的
It's okay.

395
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:41,450
我们走 没事了
Let's go. It's okay.

396
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,500
没事了
It's okay.

397
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:47,110
没事了 没事了
It's okay. It's okay.

398
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,330
没事了
It's okay.

399
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,360
我在德州？
Am I in Texas?

400
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,670
是的
Yeah, we are.

401
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:35,200
你叫什么名字？
What do you want us to call you?

402
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,200
-伊莎贝拉 -伊莎贝拉
Isabel.Isabel.

403
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:44,120
我要问一些问题
I need to ask you a question.

404
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:51,650
他们伤害你了吗？
Did they hurt you?

405
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:59,620
这里是怎么弄的？
What happened here?

406
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,580
我在学校打架了
I got in a fight at school.

407
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,200
我什么时候可以回家呢？
So when do I get to go back home?

408
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:18,550
我们还需要解决一些问题
Well, we still need to work through some things

409
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,030
确保我们了解所有发生的情况
to make sure we understand all the circumstances

410
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,200
包括你被绑架的情况 好吗？
surrounding your abduction, okay?

411
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,810
你在这里是安全的
But you're safe.

412
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,430
等会儿你就可以回家
So hang in there, we're gonna get you home very soon.

413
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:39,740
艾丽西亚会照顾你的
Alicia will look after you.

414
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,750
有什么需要的 你就问她
And if you need anything, just ask her.

415
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:24,440
我们把这女孩放在马塔莫罗斯的地盘中央
We put the girl in the middle of Matamoros territory,

416
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:26,140
雷耶斯将会开战
and Reyes will start the fireworks.

417
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:29,530
我们在哪里放下她比较好呢？
What's a good spot where we can leave her?

418
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:32,450
我们会把她带到蒙德斯的联邦警察局
We'll hold her in a federal police depot in Méndez.

419
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,230
我们很深入马塔莫罗斯地盘
We're deep enough in Matamoros land

420
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:36,020
如果他们来找她
that they'll have to fight their way out

421
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:38,320
就必须杀出一条血路
if they come looking for her.

422
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,980
你在哪里找到她的？
Where do I say you found her?

423
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:46,200
我们突袭了布朗斯维尔的一个安全屋
Oh, say we raided a safe house in Brownsville

424
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:47,900
在那里找到了她
and found her there.

425
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:50,160
马塔罗斯贩毒集团在这一带势力非常强大
Matamoros Cartel is very strong in this area.

426
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:51,950
雷耶斯将很难让他的人通过那里
Reyes will have trouble getting his men through.

427
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,470
他们会让他的人通过的
Ah, they'll let his men through.

428
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,860
撤退是他们的问题

你什么时候带她过境？

430
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,610
既然要让贩毒集团互斗
Well, now that we got the cartels

431
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,610
自然是越早越好

秘密不会持续太久

在墨西哥没有秘密

434
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:07,480
你觉得我为什么开装甲车？

435

你能帮我清理一下吗？

439
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:19,320
不管用任何理由
干掉卡洛斯雷耶斯都是好事

440
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,720

搞屁啊？！
What the fuck?!

446
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:03,930
你他妈的瞎了眼睛吗？
Hey! Why don't you keep your fucking eyes peeled?

447
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:09,410
根本分不出他们是不是混帮派
Ah, you can't even tell they're gangbangers anymore.

448
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:47,710
我有个问题
I've got a problem.

449
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:50,320

Either be home before dawn or my dad will get mad.

450
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:53,240

452
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:58,990
当你去见他时 表现的男人一点
When you meet him, act like a fucking man.

453
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:02,030

You ready to be a man, right?

454
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:07,430
-好吧 表弟 -好吧

464
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,640
别在这给我鬼扯 快去找到他

465
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:21,050
这些白痴们

466
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:26,360
33号车需要更多的移民

467
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,390
操

468
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:34,010

469
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:36,650
没有
No. ¿No?

470

它们全都很大 五颜六色的

472
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:51,910
但我最喜欢的还是其中一条大鱼

473
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:55,610
我叫它圣诞老人 因为它实在太肥了

474

我会把她劈成碎片

476

把她喂给圣诞老人

477
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:10,010

478
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:13,410
-你会穿越边境 对吧？

591
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:11,370

All right?

592
00:59:13,410 --> 00:59:15,810

有三辆警车从六点钟方向靠近

伊莎贝拉？
Isabel?

609
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:01,360
不！
No!

610
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:03,760
不！
No!

611
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:28,780

你会没事的

613
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:49,950
到底是谁绑架了我？
Who kidnapped me?

614
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:59,960
你父亲敌人太多
Your father has a lot of enemies.

615
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:05,660
你是其中之一？
And you're one of them?

616
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:08,880
是的
Yes, I am.

617
01:04:23,550 --> 01:04:26,160
-你需要缝合伤口 -是啊 很幸运
-You're gonna need stitches. -Yeah. Lucky for me

618

我明天还得用这条手臂

619
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:31,380
阳光小姐在你身后
Miss Sunshine on your six.

620
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:33,950
该死的星期一 是吧？
Hi. Fuckin' Mondays, huh?

621
01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:38,910
我们能单独聊会儿吗？
Can we go somewhere that's private?

622
01:04:40,090 --> 01:04:41,390
没问题
All right.

623
01:04:41,570 --> 01:04:43,960
-请稍等一下 -女士
Can you give me a sec?Ma'am.

624
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:48,790
我有可靠的消息来源
My source is with her right now.

625
01:04:48,970 --> 01:04:50,450
她几小时后会回到这里
She'll be back in an hour.

626
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:52,060
我说的不是这个
That's not what I'm talking about.

627
01:04:52,230 --> 01:04:53,620
不是蓝就是绿 辛西雅
It was a green on blue, Cynthia.

628
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:55,020
没有别的选择
There was no other option.

629
01:04:55,190 --> 01:04:56,930
你当时想要阿富汗 现在得到了
You wanted Afghanistan, now you got it.

630
01:04:57,110 --> 01:04:58,410
这里不是阿富汗
This isn't Afghanistan.

631
01:04:58,590 --> 01:05:00,280
这是我们的邻国
This is our fucking neighbor!

632
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:03,850
有5400万美国人在那里有亲戚
There are 54 million Americans with relatives there,

633
01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:05,900
他们坐在那里看好戏
Mm-hmm.and they're all sitting around

634
01:05:06,070 --> 01:05:09,120
福斯新闻播出 墨西哥警察尸横遍野
watching footage of dead Mexican police

635
01:05:09,290 --> 01:05:11,900
警察跟毒贩串通好了
on Fox News.The police were the ambush.

636
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:13,600
我们别无选择
Oh, yeah, okay.We had no choice.

637
01:05:13,770 --> 01:05:15,430
他们袭击了我们
All...They attacked us.

638
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,130
无所谓了
Doesn't matter.

639
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:18,780
上头对这事已经没兴趣了
doesn't have the stomach for this.

640
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:20,390
我们被封杀了
He shut us down.

641
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,700
-你说什么？ -我们被封杀了
-What did you say? -We're shut down.

642
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:26,270
我做好了我的工作 你去做你该做的
I did my fuckin' job. You do yours.

643
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:28,480
你去跟那个懦夫解释
You sit that fuckin' coward down,

644
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:32,270
把这一切讲给他听 我们才能赢
and you explain to him-- this is how we win.

645
01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:33,790
他根本不关心赢不赢
He's not worried about winning.

646
01:05:33,970 --> 01:05:36,540
他只担心会不会被弹劾
He's worried about being fucking impeached,

647
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:39,060
因为你们杀了二十几个墨西哥警察
because you killed two dozen Mexican police.

648
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:40,800
他们是为雷耶斯卖命的人警察
Who worked for Reyes.

649
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:43,110
动动脑袋 做好你的事
Spin it. Do your job.

650
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,110
这会巩固我们的立足点
This only strengthens our position.

651
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:46,940
我们没有立足点 麦特
We don't have a position, Matt.

652
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:49,420
因为我们根本不该出现在那该死的地方
Because we're not supposed to fucking be there.

653
01:05:49,590 --> 01:05:52,250
你的目标是挑起墨西哥贩毒集团之间的战争
Your objective was to start a war with Mexican cartels,

654
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:54,730
而不是针对墨西哥政府
not with the Mexican government.

655
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:56,300
你知道吗？
You know what?

656
01:05:56,470 --> 01:05:58,340
所以说什么都没改变
This-this is why nothing ever changes.

657
01:05:58,510 --> 01:06:01,520
你真以为改变才是目的 真的？
You think change is the goal? Really?

658
01:06:01,690 --> 01:06:04,480
你干太久了 才会相信这套
You've been doing this too long to believe that.

659
01:06:48,650 --> 01:06:49,870
你好 先生 麻烦一下

660
01:06:50,150 --> 01:06:52,170
我们迷路了

661
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:55,120
不要害怕

662
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:21,840
我不是坏人

663
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:37,540
我叫阿加德罗

664
01:07:39,710 --> 01:07:41,540
你叫什么名字？

665
01:07:45,010 --> 01:07:46,540
Sí.

666
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:52,390
阿杰

667
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,820
我们需要食物和水

668
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:03,960
还需要一个休息的地方

669
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:06,840
如果你能帮助我们

670
01:08:06,790 --> 01:08:08,840
我可以付钱给你

671
01:08:16,790 --> 01:08:20,840
她上过电视 她被绑架了

672
01:08:24,490 --> 01:08:25,840
帮帮我 还有她

673
01:08:30,490 --> 01:08:33,440
你怎么会手语？

674
01:08:36,490 --> 01:08:38,540
因为我的女儿

675
01:08:42,190 --> 01:08:44,340
她是聋哑人吗？

676
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:48,840
是的

677
01:08:52,190 --> 01:08:54,840
抱歉

678
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:27,330
你们为什么不把她关在墨西哥某处？
Why didn't you hold her someplace in Mexico?

679
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:29,550
我们在那里没有基础设施 长官
We don't have the infrastructure for that, sir.

680
01:09:29,730 --> 01:09:31,340
几乎不可能保证任务安全 
Mission security would be almost impossible.

681
01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:33,080
-这是你的任务吗？-不是 长官
Was this your mission?No, sir.

682
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:34,770
那你该怎么回答？
Then why are you answering?

683
01:09:34,950 --> 01:09:37,690
格雷夫先生？
Mr. Graver?

684
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:40,170
我们在那里没有基础设施 长官
We don't have the infrastructure for that, sir.

685
01:09:40,350 --> 01:09:43,090
几乎不可能保证任务安全
Mission security would be almost impossible.

686
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:51,880
这女孩已经目击了所有行动过程
And this girl was witness to all aspects of the mission,

687
01:09:52,050 --> 01:09:55,010
-对吗？ -不 她只是被绑架了
correct? -No, she was shielded from the kidnapping.

688
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:57,710
那么那25名墨西哥警察
What about the 25 Mexican police officers

689
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:59,580
在墨西哥的土地上被杀掉
that were killed, on foreign soil,

690
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:01,670
她是否目睹了全过程？
all of which she witnessed?

691
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,930
-那些袭击我们的人？ -是的 长官
-The ones who attacked us? -Yes, sir.

692
01:10:06,630 --> 01:10:08,760
她现在在哪里？
Where is she?

693
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:12,070
我有人会把她带回边境
I have a source bringing her to the border.

694
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:14,380
现在有具体的位置吗？
Do we have an exact location?

695
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:18,300
我在问你 福尔辛先生
That question is for you, Mr. Forsing.

696
01:10:19,950 --> 01:10:21,560
我们现在还不知道他们在哪里
We don't know her whereabouts, sir,

697
01:10:21,730 --> 01:10:23,480
不过他有信号器 一旦靠近边境
but he has a beacon-- he'll activate it

698
01:10:23,650 --> 01:10:25,560
他就会启动信号器
as soon as he gets close to the border.

699
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:28,180
如果他们到的了边境
If they can make it to the border.

700
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:31,270
这是我们不能冒的风险
Which is a chance we cannot take.

701
01:10:33,090 --> 01:10:35,140
辛西雅
Cynthia.

702
01:10:35,310 --> 01:10:36,660
是的 长官
Yes, sir?

703
01:10:38,710 --> 01:10:40,620
现在由你接管任务
You handle it from here.

704
01:10:55,810 --> 01:10:58,770
我们不能冒险让她落入别人手中
We can't risk her falling into the wrong hands.

705
01:10:58,950 --> 01:11:00,900
信号器一旦被启动
When the beacon's activated,

706
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:02,640
你们必须要处理掉他们
your team takes them.

707
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:03,910
明白吗？
You understand?

708
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:09,300
清理现场
Clean the scene.

709
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:11,960
我说的清理 各位 是要毫无瑕疵
When I say clean, gentlemen, I mean spotless.

710
01:11:12,130 --> 01:11:13,960
包括你的人
Your operative included.

711
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:21,100
你知道
Do you know...

712
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:23,930
他这样做有多难吗？
how hard he was to make?

713
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:26,150
我朝河中丢根棍子
I could throw a stick across the river

714
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,710
都能打到50个悲伤的父亲
and hit 50 grieving fathers.

715
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:30,760
再做一次
Make another one.

716
01:11:30,930 --> 01:11:32,890
我办不到
Can't do that.

717
01:11:33,070 --> 01:11:35,500
现在看来是谁最倒胃口
Well, look who doesn't have the stomach for it now.

718
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:37,590
我替你擦了多少屁股
Oh, who are you to question me

719
01:11:37,770 --> 01:11:39,770
你有何资格来质问我？
after all the shit that I've eaten for you?

720
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:43,990
我们确认了炸弹攻击者的身份 麦特
We ID'd the other bombers, Matt.

721
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:45,950
他们是美国公民
They're U.S. citizens.

722
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:48,210
他们来自纽泽西 什么都没改变
They're from New Jersey.Doesn't change anything.

723
01:11:48,390 --> 01:11:50,340
什么都他妈的改变了！
It changes the fucking narrative!

724
01:12:12,790 --> 01:12:16,220
-这孩子耳聋了吗？
-没有

725
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:20,530
不一样的世界

726
01:12:21,450 --> 01:12:22,580
不一样的世界

727
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:30,950
我明白了

728
01:12:57,590 --> 01:12:58,760
嘿
Hey.

729
01:12:58,930 --> 01:13:00,200
嘿
Hey.

730
01:13:00,370 --> 01:13:01,890
你找到那个女孩了？
You got the girl?

731
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:03,640
是的 她现在和我在一起
She's with me now, yeah.

732
01:13:05,550 --> 01:13:07,420
他们要我清理干净
They want me to cut ties.

733
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,600
你必须把她处理掉
You got to get rid of her.

734
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:17,130
我不能这么做
I can't do that.

735
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:19,300
你说什么？
What are you telling me?

736
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:21,650
这次不行
Not this one.

737
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:25,530
帮我带她越境
Help me get her across,

738
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:27,830
然后再决定怎么处置她
and we can decide what to do with her.

739
01:13:28,010 --> 01:13:31,620
别让我为难
Uh-uh. Don't put me in that situation.

740
01:13:31,790 --> 01:13:34,490
如果他们要清理干净 就已经很为难你了
If they're cutting ties, you're already in that situation.

741
01:13:39,190 --> 01:13:41,500
如果把她留在这里 她会被杀死的
If she stays here, she'll be killed.

742
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:46,030
帮我带她越境
Help me get her across.

743
01:13:51,730 --> 01:13:53,990
我帮不了你
I can't help you do that.

744
01:14:02,690 --> 01:14:05,130
你做你应该做的
You gotta do what you gotta do.

745
01:14:05,310 --> 01:14:07,350
我再想办法
I'll figure it out.

746
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:14,050
祝你好运
Good luck.

747
01:15:17,510 --> 01:15:20,160
我得带你去北方
I got to get you north.

748
01:16:07,470 --> 01:16:09,300
看 闪光的就代表你
See, the flashing light is you.

749
01:16:09,470 --> 01:16:11,300
好吗？那条红线
All right? That red line,

750
01:16:11,470 --> 01:16:12,820
就是你的路线
that's your path.

751
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,570
好的 别弄湿了
Okay.Don't get that wet.

752
01:16:25,010 --> 01:16:27,230
注意安全
Keep it safe for a bit.

753
01:16:33,710 --> 01:16:36,020
嘿
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

754
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:38,410
记住他们是绵羊
They're sheep.

755
01:16:38,590 --> 01:16:40,720
{\reng_zimu}Treat them like it.

756
01:16:38,590 --> 01:16:40,720
把他们当做绵羊

757
01:17:05,140 --> 01:17:06,790
!Rápido!

758
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:12,710
救命

759
01:17:13,970 --> 01:17:14,970
别管她 继续走！

760
01:17:15,150 --> 01:17:16,710
!Vámonos!

761
01:17:16,970 --> 01:17:17,970
跟上我

762
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:18,690
我们到了

763
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:24,130
快点

764
01:18:25,350 --> 01:18:27,090
都快点

765
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:29,220
沿着小路去公路边
Follow the trail to the road.

766
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:31,140
有车子在等你
Your ride's waiting.

767
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:55,940
没事的
It's okay.

768
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:57,730
上来吧
Come on.

769
01:19:15,570 --> 01:19:18,230
给我报酬更高的工作 我来做
Show me a job that pays better and I'll do it.

770
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,750
你要去哪里 宝贝？
Where are you headed, baby?

771
01:19:21,930 --> 01:19:23,580
带我去特伦顿的杂货店
Get me to the grocery store on Trenton.

772
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:25,190
我从那里步行离开
I can walk from there.

773
01:19:47,650 --> 01:19:49,870
为什么一个军人懂得用手语？
Why does a soldier know sign language?

774
01:19:53,310 --> 01:19:54,870
我女儿是个聋哑人
My daughter was deaf.

775
01:20:03,270 --> 01:20:05,400
我知道你是谁了
I know who you are.

776
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:12,890
你是被他们杀死全家人的律师
You're the attorney whose family they killed.

777
01:20:16,420 --> 01:20:18,500
不是 "他们"
Not "they."

778
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:28,690
我的父亲
My father.

779
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:31,080
你父亲的手下杀的
A man who worked for him.

780
01:20:39,350 --> 01:20:40,660
为什么？
Why?

781
01:20:42,090 --> 01:20:44,490
为了警告我
To send a message.

782
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:49,750
现在你要猎杀他们
Now you hunt them...

783
01:20:49,930 --> 01:20:52,840
你不仅仅是要警告
so you won't be a message.

784
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:57,940
我永远都在警告他们
I will always be a message.

785
01:20:58,110 --> 01:21:01,630
只不过现在警告的方式变了
Only now, the message is different.

786
01:21:17,350 --> 01:21:20,700
边境很难通过吗？
Is the border hard to cross?

787
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:27,490
可能会
It could be...

788
01:21:27,660 --> 01:21:29,530
对伊莎贝拉 雷耶斯而言
for Isabel Reyes.

789
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:49,030
从现在起 你的名字叫卡瑞娜
From now on, your name is Carina.

790
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,600
我叫卡瑞娜

791
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:58,080
你来自瓦哈卡州

792
01:22:05,350 --> 01:22:07,530
如果有人问我是谁

793
01:22:08,980 --> 01:22:13,890
就说你付钱要我假扮你爸爸

794
01:22:17,070 --> 01:22:19,670
为什么不直接说你是我爸爸

795
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:23,670
因为撒谎会带给你安全

796
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:27,670
所以现在开始 我们要说些谎话

797
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:35,670
把你鞋子给我

798
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:38,670
那是什么？

799
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:42,370
GPS信号器

800
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,670
万一我们走散了

801
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:06,190
信号在1993位置被启动了
Signal was activated at 1939,

802
01:23:06,370 --> 01:23:08,280
雷诺萨城东北方
heading northeast of Reynosa.

803
01:23:14,420 --> 01:23:16,600
我派其他部队完成这项任务
I'm sending another team to finish this.

804
01:23:16,770 --> 01:23:20,080
不用 我处理
No. I'll do it.

805
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:23,210
如果我不处理 他说不定回来连你都杀了
'Cause if I don't, he'll probably come and kill you.

806
01:24:32,110 --> 01:24:34,150
这么多人

807
01:24:34,330 --> 01:24:35,630
这就是现实

808
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:41,980
-这里的老大呢？
-马上就来

809
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:51,010
早安 未来的美国佬 感觉如何

810
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:53,690
谁还没交钱呢？

811
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:55,390
你吗？

812
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:57,690
没有

813
01:25:58,040 --> 01:26:00,690
知道多少钱吗？

814
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:03,690
我们两人 一千元

815
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:06,290
每人一千

816
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:09,690
我到了那边还得用钱呢

817
01:26:10,740 --> 01:26:12,690
这没得商量

818
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:17,690
小孩子得上另一辆车

819
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:19,690
Oh...

820
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:23,690
我们得在一起

821
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:27,190
这是一千块

822
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:35,690
这是另外一千

823
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:41,690
那行吧 好的

824
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:40,690
所有人上蓝色巴士

825
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:46,690
你们俩 要在一起的

826
01:27:46,740 --> 01:27:47,690
带上孩子 走吧

827
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:50,290
其他人 先在这里等着

828
01:28:48,100 --> 01:28:50,190
路上有干扰
There's interference on the road.

829
01:28:52,230 --> 01:28:55,590
-车辆有没有标记 是警察吗？-没有标记
-Are the vehicles unmarked or police? -Unmarked.

830
01:28:58,590 --> 01:29:00,420
什么时候抵达？
ETA to target?

831
01:29:00,590 --> 01:29:02,160
25分钟之后
25 minutes.

832
01:29:07,420 --> 01:29:10,120
各位朋友 前面就是天堂了

833
01:29:23,740 --> 01:29:25,960
别动

834
01:29:36,860 --> 01:29:38,500
你带枪了？

835
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,500
是的

836
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:43,420
站起来

837
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:48,550
搜一下他

838
01:29:59,290 --> 01:30:00,560
包里还有什么东西？

839
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:02,260
毒品吗？

840
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:04,570
不是

841
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:08,830
所有人下车

842
01:30:10,940 --> 01:30:12,570
快点

843
01:30:29,150 --> 01:30:30,540
瞧瞧我们找到了什么

844
01:30:31,150 --> 01:30:33,540
移民禁止带枪

845
01:30:37,250 --> 01:30:38,940
是他吗？

846
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:49,050
是他

847
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:53,570
你几天前是不是去过德州？

848
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:56,570
没有 没去过

849
01:30:56,920 --> 01:30:57,840
没有？

850
01:30:58,540 --> 01:31:02,250
我的人可不会撒谎 特别是对我

851
01:31:30,100 --> 01:31:32,270
把伊莎贝拉带去我的车上

852
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:02,570
你到底是想干什么

853
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:06,370
你是想去对面渡假吗？

854
01:32:06,210 --> 01:32:07,430
不是

855
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:09,570
我们的处境不太妙

856
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:13,570
只能透过这种方式越境

857
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:17,570
我跟女孩说 带她去见她妈妈

858
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:24,570
你们的人越境会赚很多钱

859
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:27,570
但也会很危险

860
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:31,370
都是为了自己和爱的人

861
01:32:32,900 --> 01:32:38,570
如果你伤害那女孩 新的战争就会开始

862
01:32:39,700 --> 01:32:41,570
你们脱不了关系

863
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:49,570
或者我们可以打个电话 换取所有人安全

864
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:54,570
这样对大家都好 不用惹任何麻烦

865
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:01,570
你不是卡洛斯的人吗？

866
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:05,970
这个你不用管 兄弟

867
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:26,570
别害怕 我们是来保护你的

868
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:32,570
你们到底有什么秘密？

869
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:34,570
不知道

870
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:39,570
他是我雇用的

871
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:44,570
来假扮我父亲

872
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:51,570
你朋友说他是卡洛斯的手下

873
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:55,570
你父亲的人

874
01:33:59,930 --> 01:34:01,020
嗯？

875
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:05,610
是的

876
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:27,570
现在该怎么办呢？

877
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:35,570
打电话给我的人 让他们联络老大

878
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:41,570
那就打吧

879
01:34:53,510 --> 01:34:55,210
不！
No! No!
