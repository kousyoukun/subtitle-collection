00:16:09,409 --> 00:16:10,955
挺不錯的
{\fs12}It's pretty good.

131
00:16:15,415 --> 00:16:16,752
他們賺多少錢
{\fs12}How much they make?

132
00:16:19,724 --> 00:16:21,247
望風的嗎
{\fs12}For lookout?

133
00:16:21,421 --> 00:16:24,277
每天 20 30
{\fs12}20, 30 a day.

134
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:26,775
夥計 他就值這點錢
{\fs12}Man, but that's all they're worth.

135
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,223
但是你
{\fs12}But you...

136
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,660
媽的 河的兩邊你都很熟悉
{\fs12}well, shit, you know both sides of the river.

137
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:37,089
你有護照 來去隨意
{\fs12}You got a passport. Come and go as you please.

138
00:16:41,836 --> 00:16:43,313
拉法
{\fs12}Rafa!

139
00:16:43,811 --> 00:16:45,548
把我介紹給你表妹 混蛋

140
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:48,801
你放屁

141
00:16:51,304 --> 00:16:52,304
你認識他嗎

142
00:16:52,329 --> 00:16:53,548
嗯
{\fs12}Eh.

143
00:16:54,762 --> 00:16:56,392
他表妹屁股大

144
00:16:57,588 --> 00:16:58,981
肥臀
{\fs12}Fat ass.

145
00:17:03,072 --> 00:17:04,508
怎麼了
{\fs12}What's going on?

146
00:17:04,533 --> 00:17:05,882
把啤酒藏起來
{\fs12}Hide the beer.

147
00:17:17,229 --> 00:17:19,013
你可以出個價
{\fs12}You can name your own price, you know.

148
00:17:22,613 --> 00:17:23,836
這是邊境
{\fs12}This is the border.

149
00:17:24,581 --> 00:17:28,241
馬塔莫羅斯販毒集團 出價很好
{\fs12}The Matamoros Cartel pay people well to work it.

150
00:17:32,057 --> 00:17:33,829
你可以
{\fs12}You can, uh...

151
00:17:35,365 --> 00:17:37,250
和我一起賺錢 表弟
{\fs12}start making your earn with me, cousin.

152
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,312
拿去吧
{\fs12}Take it.

153
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:57,953
是你的了
{\fs12}It's yours.

154
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:10,400
我要怎麼做
{\fs12}So, what do I have to do?

155
00:18:20,671 --> 00:18:24,105
你該抹點防曬霜 馬特
{\fs12}You really ought to invest in a little sunscreen, Matt.

156
00:18:24,588 --> 00:18:26,590
如果明天開戰 萬里多雲
{\fs12}If you guys would start wars someplace cloudy,

157
00:18:26,615 --> 00:18:28,008
我就不必抹了
{\fs12}I wouldn't have to.

158
00:18:34,657 --> 00:18:37,122
司法部有其他自殺炸彈襲擊者的身份嗎
{\fs12}DOJ get an ID on those other suicide bombers?

159
00:18:37,296 --> 00:18:39,951
還沒有 可能正在搞
{\fs12}Not yet.Uh, might want to get on that.

160
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:44,390
據信 是雷耶斯販毒集團 幫助他們到邊境的 所以
{\fs12}There's proof Reyes Cartel helped one of them get to the border, so...

161
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,026
線索知道的夠多了
{\fs12}we know enough to move forward.

162
00:18:49,255 --> 00:18:50,483
部長先生
{\fs12}Mr. Secretary...

163
00:18:51,424 --> 00:18:52,800
馬特·格拉弗
{\fs12}Matt Graver.

164
00:18:54,271 --> 00:18:55,498
坐吧
{\fs12}Have a seat.

165
00:19:08,441 --> 00:19:13,680
你認為販毒集團跨越國界最有價值的商品是什麼
{\fs12}What do you think is the most valuable commodity that cartels move across our borders?

166
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:18,381
20年前 是可卡因
{\fs12}20 years ago, cocaine.

167
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:21,819
今天我得說 是人
{\fs12}Uh, today I'd have to say it'd be people.

168
00:19:21,993 --> 00:19:25,214
這種資源 不需要培養或處理
{\fs12}It's a resource they don't have to cultivate or process

169
00:19:25,388 --> 00:19:26,737
就算沒能越境
{\fs12}and if they don't make it across,

170
00:19:26,911 --> 00:19:29,783
他們會再次付錢越境 價格三倍於一公斤貨
{\fs12}they can pay to cross again at three times the price of a kilo.

171
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:36,007
你怎麼定義恐怖主義 格拉弗先生
{\fs12}How would you define terrorism, Mr. Graver?

172
00:19:36,617 --> 00:19:38,412
那是你的工作 先生
{\fs12}I think that's your job, sir.

173
00:19:42,231 --> 00:19:47,976
目前的定義是"任何使用暴力實現政治目標的個人或團體"
{\fs12}The current definition is "Any individual or group that uses violence to achieve a political goal."

174
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:53,546
政府認為 販毒集團現在符合這一定義
{\fs12}The administration believes that the drug cartels now fit that definition.

175
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:59,291
下周 總統會將販毒集團加入恐怖組織名單
{\fs12}Next week, the president's adding drug cartels to the list of terrorist organizations.

176
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:03,412
這樣我們就能擴大打擊他們
{\fs12}You can understand how that will expand our ability to combat them.

177
00:20:04,209 --> 00:20:06,995
販毒集團領土目前相當穩定
{\fs12}The cartel territories are fairly stable at the moment,

178
00:20:07,169 --> 00:20:09,649
但正如我們在伊拉克學到的
{\fs12}but as we learned in Iraq,

179
00:20:09,674 --> 00:20:14,679
鷸蚌相爭的話 打擊敵人就更容易
{\fs12}striking your enemy is a whole hell of a lot easier if they're fighting each other.

180
00:20:18,156 --> 00:20:19,896
悉聽尊便
{\fs12}I'll do whatever you need.

181
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:21,622
指路就行
{\fs12}Just point the way.

182
00:20:23,576 --> 00:20:25,404
你有想法嗎
{\fs12}Do you have any thoughts?

183
00:20:26,352 --> 00:20:28,581
我是說 我不能幹掉販毒頭子
{\fs12}I mean, I wouldn't take out a cartel leader.

184
00:20:28,755 --> 00:20:31,019
幹掉一個就會冒出五十個
{\fs12}Turn one cartel into 50.

185
00:20:31,193 --> 00:20:33,935
此外 殺死國王不會發動戰爭 而是結束
{\fs12}Besides, killing kings doesn't start wars, it ends them.

186
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:36,024
正是我們的顧慮
{\fs12}That's our concern.Mm-hmm.

187
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,288
知道雷耶斯在哪媔
{\fs12}You have a location on Reyes?

188
00:20:39,462 --> 00:20:41,594
沒有 但全家都在監控之下
{\fs12}No, but the family's under surveillance.

189
00:20:41,768 --> 00:20:43,379
他和他們有聯繫嗎
{\fs12}Is he in contact with them?

190
00:20:43,404 --> 00:20:45,667
據我們所知沒有 但我們假設有聯繫
{\fs12}Not to our knowledge, but we assume yes.

191
00:20:46,831 --> 00:20:48,819
有孩子嗎 兩個
{\fs12}Any kids? Two.

192
00:20:48,993 --> 00:20:50,212
最小的幾歲
{\fs12}What's the age of the youngest?

193
00:20:50,386 --> 00:20:51,604
16歲
{\fs12}Sixteen.

194
00:20:51,629 --> 00:20:52,892
16
{\fs12}Sixteen?

195
00:20:57,216 --> 00:20:59,452
如果你想發動戰爭
{\fs12}Yeah, if you want to start a war...

196
00:21:00,744 --> 00:21:02,006
綁架王子
{\fs12}kidnap a prince.

197
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,269
國王會宣戰的
{\fs12}King will start it for you.

198
00:21:08,404 --> 00:21:10,449
你在中東做過這種事
{\fs12}You did this sort of thing in the Middle East.

199
00:21:10,623 --> 00:21:11,973
嗯
{\fs12}Hmm.

200
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:15,092
這一套可行嗎
{\fs12}You think those tactics will work here?

201
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:17,891
只要您願意 先生
{\fs12}If you want it to, sir.

202
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:31,340
靴子落地 你要僱傭外人
{\fs12}Boots on the ground, you're gonna hire on the outside.

203
00:21:31,365 --> 00:21:32,845
包括後勤列車
{\fs12}And the same goes for your supply train

204
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,785
還有空中支援
{\fs12}and for air support.

205
00:21:35,257 --> 00:21:40,697
不需要我提醒你 如果他們發現幕後是我們會怎樣
{\fs12}And I don't need to remind you what happens if they figure out that it's us.

206
00:21:44,831 --> 00:21:46,290
醜話說在前
{\fs12}Just to be clear,

207
00:21:46,703 --> 00:21:48,793
想搞定這事兒
{\fs12}you want to see this thing through,

208
00:21:49,401 --> 00:21:51,962
我就得玩陰招
{\fs12}I'm gonna have to get... dirty.

209
00:21:56,278 --> 00:21:58,932
所以我才找你來
{\fs12}Dirty is exactly why you're here.

210
00:22:02,936 --> 00:22:04,642
你要什麼
{\fs12}What do you need?

211
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:06,940
一切
{\fs12}Everything.

212
00:22:07,115 --> 00:22:09,204
具有攻擊力的無人機
{\fs12}Drones with attack capability...

213
00:22:09,229 --> 00:22:11,100
你有黑鷹 對吧
{\fs12}You have Black Hawks, right?Mm-hmm.

214
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:13,388
我要兩架 我需要後勤
{\fs12}I want two of those. I need logistics,

215
00:22:13,413 --> 00:22:16,503
與海豹突擊隊兼容的通信設備
{\fs12}communications equipment compatible with a SOCOM JCU.

216
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:18,952
第一階段 我需要打擊小隊
{\fs12}First phase, I need a strike team,

217
00:22:19,127 --> 00:22:21,390

{\fs12}two snipers, I need a demolition team...

218
00:22:21,415 --> 00:22:23,069
你要去烏克蘭嗎
{\fs12}Are you going to Ukraine?

219
00:22:23,392 --> 00:22:25,002
俄羅斯人是要錢的 兄弟
{\fs12}I got Russians on the payroll, brother.

220
00:22:25,027 --> 00:22:26,594
不要我進退兩難
{\fs12}Don't put me in that position.

221
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:30,573
在哪媯o動
{\fs12}Where's the coup?

222
00:22:31,226 --> 00:22:32,488
這只不過是
{\fs12}It's an extraction...

223
00:22:32,662 --> 00:22:33,750
開胃菜
{\fs12}for starters.

224
00:22:34,438 --> 00:22:36,187
我能知道多少
{\fs12}How much can I know?

225
00:22:36,212 --> 00:22:38,736
兄弟 你不會想知道的
{\fs12}Brother, you don't want to know.

226
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,280
我不需要細節
{\fs12}Well, I don't need specifics,

227
00:22:42,305 --> 00:22:44,307
但我得知道他們要去哪

墨西哥
{\fs12}Mexico.

229
00:22:52,377 --> 00:22:53,422
你耍我吧
{\fs12}You gotta be fucking kidding me.

230
00:22:53,447 --> 00:22:55,188
與政府無關
{\fs12}It's not the government.

231
00:22:55,511 --> 00:22:57,319
而是販毒集團
{\fs12}It's cartel.

232
00:22:59,602 --> 00:23:01,386
財政部削減預算了嗎
{\fs12}Treasury cutting the checks?

233
00:23:01,411 --> 00:23:04,159
在巴西有一家公司 名叫媔羉德
{\fs12}Eh, under a company in Brazil called Rio Verde.

234
00:23:12,615 --> 00:23:14,443

我就得負責每月1000萬的工資和供給

242
00:25:59,085 --> 00:26:01,131
聖誕節東西隨便買
{\fs12}You'll be easy to shop for at Christmas.

243
00:26:04,526 --> 00:26:05,918
我不慶祝聖誕節
{\fs12}I don't celebrate Christmas.

244
00:26:07,585 --> 00:26:10,054
好吧 我肯定你今年會慶祝的
{\fs12}Well, I bet you will this year.

245
00:26:11,593 --> 00:26:13,246
他們做什麼的
{\fs12}What'd they do?

246
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:15,184
無所謂

卡洛斯·雷耶斯

00:26:39,391 --> 00:26:41,345
夠不夠說服你
{\fs12}How's that for loose?

252
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:47,177
這是你為家人報仇的機會
{\fs12}It's your chance to get even for your family.

253
00:26:53,139 --> 00:26:55,349
你要幫我們發動一場戰爭
{\fs12}You're gonna help us start a war.

254
00:26:56,621 --> 00:26:58,536

00:28:35,132 --> 00:28:39,428
警方推測 他是死於對手販毒集團

261
00:28:40,104 --> 00:28:43,348
恐怕會引起連鎖反擊

262
00:28:43,373 --> 00:28:46,601
及新的販毒戰爭

263
00:29:02,993 --> 00:29:04,923
把她帶到樓堥虓|容易得多
{\fs12}This would have been a lot easier taking her in the house.

264
00:29:05,938 --> 00:29:07,914
街上太草率
{\fs12}Could get real sloppy on the street.

265
00:29:08,492 --> 00:29:09,416
草率更好
{\fs12}Sloppy's good.

266
00:29:09,441 --> 00:29:11,443
看起來像販毒集團干的
{\fs12}Sloppy makes it look like the cartel did it.

267
00:29:20,939 --> 00:29:22,375
好 我們走
{\fs12}All right, let's go.

268
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:54,236
我殺了你

269
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,630
賤人

270
00:30:02,447 --> 00:30:04,304
你看什麼看

271
00:30:09,379 --> 00:30:11,103
是她先動的手
{\fs12}She started it.

272
00:30:12,396 --> 00:30:13,731
雷耶斯小姐?
{\fs12}Miss Reyes?

273
00:30:16,429 --> 00:30:20,042
她罵我妓女 打我耳光 所以我揍了她
{\fs12}She called me a narco whore and slapped me, so I hit her.

274
00:30:20,695 --> 00:30:21,905
你能拿我怎麼辦
{\fs12}What would you do?

275
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:24,612
你
{\fs12}You.

276
00:30:24,786 --> 00:30:26,657
去找校醫
{\fs12}Go to the nurse.

277
00:30:29,486 --> 00:30:31,140
不 你哪也別去
{\fs12}No, you're not going anywhere.

278
00:30:31,314 --> 00:30:32,149
坐
{\fs12}Sit.

279
00:30:42,064 --> 00:30:44,036
現在我拿你怎麼辦
{\fs12}Now what am I going to do with you?

280
00:30:45,676 --> 00:30:47,069
她罪有應得
{\fs12}She deserved what she got.

281
00:30:47,243 --> 00:30:48,984
這婼不到你撒野
{\fs12}It's not your place to do it.

282
00:30:49,158 --> 00:30:50,459
好
{\fs12}Fine.

283
00:30:51,682 --> 00:30:53,670
那你去揍她一頓
{\fs12}You beat the shit out of her.

284
00:30:55,439 --> 00:30:57,906
我該開除你
{\fs12}I should expel you.

285
00:30:59,818 --> 00:31:01,126
來吧
{\fs12}Do it.

286
00:31:10,604 --> 00:31:11,920
我早料到了
{\fs12}That's what I thought.

287
00:31:31,088 --> 00:31:32,872
什麼情況
{\fs12}How we looking?

288
00:31:32,897 --> 00:31:35,204
看到獎品了嗎
{\fs12}Got eyes on the prize?

289
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:37,162
有
{\fs12}Roger.

290
00:31:37,336 --> 00:31:39,556
獎品在尾車上
{\fs12}Prize is in the tail vehicle.

291
00:32:17,043 --> 00:32:18,463
媽的

292
00:32:19,356 --> 00:32:21,775
沒有網絡了

293
00:32:26,438 --> 00:32:28,198
檢查你的手機信號

294
00:32:31,068 --> 00:32:32,577
無信號

295
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,330
踩油門

296
00:32:58,504 --> 00:32:59,897
不
{\fs12}No!

297
00:33:01,986 --> 00:33:03,684
不不不
{\fs12}No! No! No!

298
00:33:37,859 --> 00:33:40,812
告訴你老大 卡洛斯·雷耶斯

299
00:33:41,988 --> 00:33:46,109
這就是你們惹馬塔莫羅斯集團的後果

300
00:34:00,175 --> 00:34:01,872
我們去哪 直接去飛機
{\fs12}Where we going?Go straight to the plane.

301
00:34:02,046 --> 00:34:03,352
別擔心那輛車 我們會處理的
{\fs12}Don't worry about the vehicle. We'll take care of it.

302
00:34:03,526 --> 00:34:04,614
好吧
{\fs12}All right.

303
00:34:12,274 --> 00:34:14,406
你要開車去購物中心
{\fs12}All right, you're gonna drive that to the mall.

304
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:17,148
鑰匙在油箱蓋 就留在那
{\fs12}Keys are in the gas flap. You just leave them there.

305
00:34:17,173 --> 00:34:19,225
具體你到了便知
{\fs12}All right. Then you go see what's waiting for you.

306
00:35:27,802 --> 00:35:32,215
<i>德州 科珀斯克奡絡 美國海軍航空站 </i>

307
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,771
我們去哪 - 5號樓 先生
{\fs12}Where you got us?Building 5, sir.

308
00:35:58,946 --> 00:36:00,773
向左走 - 我知道在哪
{\fs12}You're gonna take a left.I know where it is.

309
00:36:25,154 --> 00:36:27,187
現在讓我看看
{\fs12}Now walk me through what I'm watching here.

310
00:36:28,137 --> 00:36:30,618
墨西哥地圖 每一格代表100英里
{\fs12}This is a map of Mexico on a hundred-mile grids.

311
00:36:30,643 --> 00:36:32,108
你的目標在這
{\fs12}And you took the subject here.

312
00:36:32,133 --> 00:36:36,863
據推測 雷耶斯的宅子在蒙特雷附近
{\fs12}Speculation is Reyes has a family residence somewhere near Monterrey.

313
00:36:38,463 --> 00:36:40,116
墨西哥警方有回復嗎
{\fs12}Has the Mexican police responded yet?

314
00:36:40,141 --> 00:36:42,970
嗯 地方 州和聯邦警察都到了
{\fs12}Yeah, local, state and federal police are all there now.

315
00:36:42,995 --> 00:36:46,206
衛星無法接收手機信號
{\fs12}Satellite cannot pick up cell chatter.

316
00:36:46,384 --> 00:36:49,910
我們可以鎖定手機的坐標 然後搜索電話號碼
{\fs12}Okay.Yeah, we can lock coordinates to the cell and snag the phone number,

317
00:36:50,084 --> 00:36:51,211
但無法竊聽電話
{\fs12}but we can't hear the call.

318
00:36:52,003 --> 00:36:54,436
給我衛星圖像 墨西哥城宅子那邊的
{\fs12}Give me a satellite feed of the house in Mexico City.

319
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:55,757
來了
{\fs12}Yeah, you got it.

320
00:36:56,612 --> 00:37:00,036
希望這個地方有打出電話 便可追蹤
{\fs12}What we're hoping for is a call from this location to start a trail.

321
00:37:00,061 --> 00:37:01,805
家埵酗H嗎
{\fs12}Any family members in the house?

322
00:37:01,922 --> 00:37:03,271
沒有 只是工作人員
{\fs12}No, just staff.

323
00:37:03,445 --> 00:37:06,361
有30多個房間豪宅的少女
{\fs12}Teenage girl with her own 30-room mansion.

324
00:37:06,535 --> 00:37:08,920
我希望我是那少女
{\fs12}I wish I was a teenage girl.

325
00:37:09,842 --> 00:37:11,714
切到現場圖像
{\fs12}Pull up the incident site.

326
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:18,112
似乎你把他們都幹掉了
{\fs12}It looks like you popped them all.

327
00:37:18,435 --> 00:37:20,480
不 我們只幹掉一個
{\fs12}No, we only engaged one.

328
00:37:20,505 --> 00:37:22,943
一個死於車禍 另兩個人是被我們捆住的
{\fs12}One died in the crash, and the other two we tied and left.

329
00:37:23,266 --> 00:37:25,311
相當大的風險 為什麼
{\fs12}That's a pretty big risk. Why do that?

330
00:37:25,336 --> 00:37:26,980
想看看他們的反應
{\fs12}Just to see what they'd do.

331
00:37:28,383 --> 00:37:30,689
回溯 看之前的錄像
{\fs12}Back it up. Show me earlier.

332
00:37:30,714 --> 00:37:32,861
就在我們離開的那一刻 是
{\fs12}A minute just after we left.Yeah.

333
00:37:34,389 --> 00:37:35,488
繼續回溯
{\fs12}Keep going.

334
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:39,592
就那 好
{\fs12}All right, there, good.

335
00:37:43,702 --> 00:37:45,487
黑手機上有新音頻
{\fs12}We have new audio coming in on the black phone.

336
00:37:48,707 --> 00:37:49,621
收到
{\fs12}Copy that.

337
00:38:07,495 --> 00:38:09,163
電話不是從那宅子打出來的
{\fs12}Call is not coming from the house,

338
00:38:09,188 --> 00:38:11,190
是那邊的那個混蛋
{\fs12}it's coming from that fucker right there.

339
00:38:11,513 --> 00:38:12,993
給我直播監聽 找到他
{\fs12}Give me a live feed and find him.

340
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:14,110

我誰也不說 我發誓

355

{\fs12}I need to ask you a question.

375
00:42:47,179 --> 00:42:48,985
他們傷害你了嗎
{\fs12}Did they hurt you?

376
00:42:55,231 --> 00:42:57,185
你臉怎麼回事
{\fs12}What happened here?

377
00:43:05,023 --> 00:43:06,819
學校堨摒[
{\fs12}I got in a fight at school.

378
00:43:11,508 --> 00:43:13,201
我幾時能回家
{\fs12}So when do I get to go back home?

379
00:43:14,552 --> 00:43:20,909
我們還需要瞭解你被綁架的所有情況 好嗎
{\fs12}Well, we still need to work through some things to make sure we understand all the circumstances surrounding your abduction, okay?

380
00:43:21,517 --> 00:43:22,519
但你很安全
{\fs12}But you're safe.

381
00:43:25,305 --> 00:43:28,133

艾麗西婭會照顧你的
{\fs12}Alicia will look after you.

383
00:43:37,621 --> 00:43:40,450
有需要 就問她
{\fs12}And if you need anything, just ask her.

384
00:44:19,881 --> 00:44:22,144
把小姑娘放在馬塔莫羅斯領地的中央
{\fs12}We put the girl in the middle of Matamoros territory,

385
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:23,841
雷耶斯會燃的
{\fs12}and Reyes will start the fireworks.

386
00:44:24,789 --> 00:44:26,524
具體哪個地點較好呢
{\fs12}What's a good spot where we can leave her?

387
00:44:28,042 --> 00:44:30,152
把她關在門德斯的聯邦警察局
{\fs12}We'll hold her in a federal police depot in Mendez.

388
00:44:30,365 --> 00:44:32,338
塔莫羅斯的地盤深處
{\fs12}We're deep enough in Matamoros land

389
00:44:32,338 --> 00:44:35,423
若他們來找她 就必須打出一條血路
{\fs12}that they'll have to fight their way out if they come looking for her.

390
00:44:39,313 --> 00:44:40,926
你在哪塈鋮鴞o的

{\fs12}Oh, say we raided a safe house in Brownsville and found her there.

392
00:44:45,459 --> 00:44:48,014
馬塔莫羅斯販毒集團 在這媔掑O強大
{\fs12}Matamoros Cartel is very strong in this area.

393

你不會有事的

573
01:03:45,611 --> 01:03:47,392
誰綁架了我

你父親有很多敵人

583
01:04:39,273 --> 01:04:40,904
請稍等 女士

線索都在她手
{\fs12}My source is with her right now.

585
01:04:46,672 --> 01:04:48,151
她一小時後回來
{\fs12}She'll be back in an hour.

586
01:04:48,325 --> 01:04:49,762
我說的不是這個意思
{\fs12}That's not what I'm talking about.

587
01:04:50,085 --> 01:04:51,477
成敗在此一舉 辛西婭
{\fs12}It was a green on blue, Cynthia.

588
01:04:51,502 --> 01:04:52,721
別無它法
{\fs12}There was no other option.

589
01:04:52,895 --> 01:04:54,636
當初在阿富汗 你成功了
{\fs12}You wanted Afghanistan, now you got it.

590
01:04:54,810 --> 01:04:56,116
這不是阿富汗
{\fs12}This isn't Afghanistan.

591
01:04:56,141 --> 01:04:57,838
這是我們的鄰居
{\fs12}This is our fucking neighbor!

592
01:04:58,161 --> 01:05:01,556
5400萬美國人 有親戚在那
{\fs12}There are 54 million Americans with relatives there,

593
01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:06,738
他們坐看《福克斯新聞》上的墨西哥警察
{\fs12}Mm-hmm.and they're all sitting around watching footage of dead Mexican police on Fox News.

594
01:05:06,738 --> 01:05:09,757
警察伏擊了我們
{\fs12}The police were the ambush.

595
01:05:09,782 --> 01:05:11,305
我們別無選擇
{\fs12}Oh, yeah, okay.We had no choice.

596
01:05:11,330 --> 01:05:12,984
他們襲擊了我們
{\fs12}All...They attacked us.

597
01:05:14,078 --> 01:05:14,979
沒有關繫了
{\fs12}Doesn't matter.

598
01:05:15,004 --> 01:05:16,484
總統對此很不滿意
{\fs12}POTUS doesn't have the stomach for this.

599
01:05:16,509 --> 01:05:17,624
我們被關閉了
{\fs12}He shut us down.

600
01:05:17,649 --> 01:05:20,210
你說什麼 - 任務終止
{\fs12}What did you say?We're shut down.

601
01:05:21,877 --> 01:05:23,963
我盡了本分 你盡你的
{\fs12}I did my fuckin' job. You do yours.

602
01:05:24,144 --> 01:05:26,189
你去跟那個偽君子坐下
{\fs12}You sit that fuckin' coward down,

603
01:05:26,363 --> 01:05:29,677
好好跟他解釋解釋 這樣才能贏
{\fs12}and you explain to him-- this is how we win.

604
01:05:29,702 --> 01:05:31,513
贏不贏 總統無所謂
{\fs12}He's not worried about winning.

605
01:05:31,673 --> 01:05:34,241
他擔心被彈劾
{\fs12}He's worried about being fucking impeached,

606
01:05:34,415 --> 01:05:36,765
因為你殺了二十幾個墨西哥警察
{\fs12}because you killed two dozen Mexican police.

607
01:05:36,790 --> 01:05:38,357
他們是雷耶斯的手下人
{\fs12}Who worked for Reyes.

608
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:40,813
動動腦子 去說服他
{\fs12}Spin it. Do your job.

609
01:05:40,838 --> 01:05:42,666
才能鞏固我們都地位
{\fs12}This only strengthens our position.

610
01:05:42,691 --> 01:05:44,345
哪有什麼地位 馬特
{\fs12}We don't have a position, Matt.

611
01:05:44,817 --> 01:05:47,123
我們就不該去那
{\fs12}Because we're not supposed to fucking be there.

612
01:05:47,148 --> 01:05:49,803
你的任務是 挑起墨西哥販毒集團之間的內戰
{\fs12}Your objective was to start a war with Mexican cartels,

613
01:05:50,126 --> 01:05:52,433
而不是招惹墨西哥政府
{\fs12}not with the Mexican government.

614
01:05:52,756 --> 01:05:54,149
你知道嗎
{\fs12}You know what?

615
01:05:54,174 --> 01:05:56,045
所以什麼都改變不了
{\fs12}This-this is why nothing ever changes.

616
01:05:56,070 --> 01:05:58,273
難道改變局勢才是目標嗎 真的嗎
{\fs12}You think change is the goal? Really?

617
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:02,533
你幹得太久 腦子壞了
{\fs12}You've been doing this too long to believe that.

618
01:06:46,421 --> 01:06:48,256
你好 先生 麻煩你一下

619
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,008
我們迷路了

620
01:06:51,259 --> 01:06:53,052
沒必要害怕

621
01:07:18,411 --> 01:07:19,829
我不是黑手黨

622
01:07:31,591 --> 01:07:35,219
我叫阿加德羅

623
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,183
你叫什麼

624
01:07:42,443 --> 01:07:43,394
是
{\fs12}Si.

625
01:07:47,982 --> 01:07:49,467
安傑

626
01:07:53,237 --> 01:07:54,847
安傑

627
01:07:56,324 --> 01:07:59,060
我們需要食物和水

628
01:08:00,377 --> 01:08:01,896
還有休息地

629
01:08:02,273 --> 01:08:03,956
如果你幫我們

630
01:08:04,874 --> 01:08:06,526
我給錢

631
01:08:14,384 --> 01:08:19,055
她上過電視 她被綁架了
她被綁架了

632
01:08:22,063 --> 01:08:23,710
幫我 幫她
幫幫她

633
01:08:28,606 --> 01:08:31,776
你怎麼會手語

634
01:08:34,536 --> 01:08:37,615
我的女兒

635
01:08:40,165 --> 01:08:41,894
她是聾子嗎

636
01:08:44,747 --> 01:08:46,357
早就是

637
01:08:50,002 --> 01:08:51,546
我很抱歉

638
01:09:21,424 --> 01:09:24,537
你為什麼不把她關在墨西哥的某個地方
{\fs12}Why didn't you hold her someplace in Mexico?

639
01:09:25,211 --> 01:09:27,256
沒有合適的關押地點 先生
{\fs12}We don't have the infrastructure for that, sir.

640
01:09:27,281 --> 01:09:28,892
如此不能保證任務安全完成
{\fs12}Mission security would be almost impossible.

641
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:30,781
這是你的任務嗎 - 不 先生
{\fs12}Was this your mission?No, sir.

642
01:09:30,956 --> 01:09:32,479
那你回答個什麼勁
{\fs12}Then why are you answering?

643
01:09:32,653 --> 01:09:34,155
格拉弗先生
{\fs12}Mr. Graver?

644
01:09:35,569 --> 01:09:37,876
沒有合適的關押地點 先生
{\fs12}We don't have the infrastructure for that, sir.

645
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:40,791
如此不能保證任務安全完成
{\fs12}Mission security would be almost impossible.

646
01:09:46,406 --> 01:09:49,583
這個任務 這個女孩什麼都看到了
{\fs12}And this girl was witness to all aspects of the mission,

647
01:09:49,757 --> 01:09:52,716
對嗎 - 不 她被綁架了 戴著頭套
{\fs12}correct?No, she was shielded from the kidnapping.

648
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:57,435
死掉的25名墨西哥警察呢
{\fs12}What about the 25 Mexican police officers that were killed, on foreign soil,

649
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:59,375
是不是也被她看見了
{\fs12}all of which she witnessed?

650
01:09:59,549 --> 01:10:01,638
襲擊我們的警察嗎 是的 先生
{\fs12}The ones who attacked us? Yes, sir.

651
01:10:04,337 --> 01:10:05,978
她在哪
{\fs12}Where is she?

652
01:10:06,829 --> 01:10:09,232
我有人 把她帶到邊境
{\fs12}I have a source bringing her to the border.

653
01:10:10,208 --> 01:10:12,084
有確切的位置嗎
{\fs12}Do we have an exact location?

654
01:10:13,781 --> 01:10:16,001
這個問題是給你的 福爾辛先生
{\fs12}That question is for you, Mr. Forsing.

655
01:10:18,132 --> 01:10:19,414
我們不知道她的下落 先生
{\fs12}We don't know her whereabouts, sir,

656
01:10:19,439 --> 01:10:23,269
但是他有信標 一旦靠近邊境 他就會激活它
{\fs12}but he has a beacon-- he'll activate it as soon as he gets close to the border.

657
01:10:23,443 --> 01:10:25,348
也要他們能到邊境
{\fs12}If they can make it to the border.

658
01:10:26,054 --> 01:10:28,970
風險不能冒
{\fs12}Which is a chance we cannot take.

659
01:10:31,149 --> 01:10:32,063
辛西婭
{\fs12}Cynthia.

660
01:10:33,018 --> 01:10:34,367
在 先生
{\fs12}Yes, sir?

661
01:10:37,026 --> 01:10:38,327
你現在接手
{\fs12}You handle it from here.

662
01:10:53,516 --> 01:10:56,476
我們不能冒著她落入壞人之手的危險
{\fs12}We can't risk her falling into the wrong hands.

663
01:10:56,948 --> 01:10:58,906
當信標被激活時
{\fs12}When the beacon's activated,

664
01:10:59,321 --> 01:11:00,888
你的團隊來接手
{\fs12}your team takes them.

665
01:11:00,913 --> 01:11:02,001
你明白嗎
{\fs12}You understand?

666
01:11:04,484 --> 01:11:06,330
收拾爛攤子
{\fs12}Clean the scene.

667
01:11:07,182 --> 01:11:09,663
我說的收拾 先生們 指的是不留活口
{\fs12}When I say clean, gentlemen, I mean spotless.

668
01:11:09,688 --> 01:11:11,516
包括你的人
{\fs12}Your operative included.

669
01:11:17,417 --> 01:11:18,401
你知道嗎
{\fs12}Do you know...

670
01:11:19,485 --> 01:11:21,320
他有多難做
{\fs12}how hard he was to make?

671
01:11:22,113 --> 01:11:23,851
我可以扔一根棍子過河
{\fs12}I could throw a stick across the river

672
01:11:24,323 --> 01:11:26,270
砸到不下50個失去子女的父親
{\fs12}and hit 50 grieving fathers.

673
01:11:27,076 --> 01:11:28,464
多一個又何妨
{\fs12}Make another one.

674
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:30,597
做不到
{\fs12}Can't do that.

675
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:33,357
有人變心了
{\fs12}Well, look who doesn't have the stomach for it now.

676
01:11:33,382 --> 01:11:37,473
在我替你背了這麼鍋之後 你還質問我
{\fs12}Oh, who are you to question me after all the shit that I've eaten for you?

677
01:11:38,546 --> 01:11:42,633
我們確認了其他炸彈手的身份 馬特
{\fs12}We ID'd the other bombers, Matt.

678
01:11:42,633 --> 01:11:43,653
他們是美國公民
{\fs12}They're U.S. citizens.

679
01:11:43,827 --> 01:11:45,916
他們是新澤西來的 這於事無補
{\fs12}They're from New Jersey.Doesn't change anything.

680
01:11:46,091 --> 01:11:48,498
性質變了
{\fs12}It changes the fucking narrative!

681
01:12:10,987 --> 01:12:12,872
寶寶聾嗎

682
01:12:13,289 --> 01:12:14,289
不

683
01:12:17,025 --> 01:12:18,711
不同的世界嗎

684
01:12:19,704 --> 01:12:22,048
不同的世界

685
01:12:27,106 --> 01:12:28,846
我理解

686
01:12:58,428 --> 01:12:59,669
姑娘在你那媔
{\fs12}You got the girl?

687
01:13:00,085 --> 01:13:01,652
正在一起
{\fs12}She's with me now, yeah.

688
01:13:03,255 --> 01:13:05,126
他們要我撇清關係
{\fs12}They want me to cut ties.

689
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:07,493
你必須除掉她
{\fs12}You got to get rid of her.

690
01:13:13,265 --> 01:13:14,417
我做不到
{\fs12}I can't do that.

691
01:13:15,518 --> 01:13:16,669
你說什麼
{\fs12}What are you telling me?

692
01:13:17,895 --> 01:13:19,230
不是這次
{\fs12}Not this one.

693
01:13:21,186 --> 01:13:23,231
幫我讓她越境
{\fs12}Help me get her across,

694
01:13:23,405 --> 01:13:25,538
然後再決定怎麼處理她
{\fs12}and we can decide what to do with her.

695
01:13:25,563 --> 01:13:28,180
別讓我左右為難
{\fs12}Uh-uh. Don't put me in that situation.

696
01:13:29,498 --> 01:13:32,197
如果上頭讓你撇清關係 你早就左右為難了
{\fs12}If they're cutting ties, you're already in that situation.

697
01:13:36,897 --> 01:13:39,204
她留下 必死無疑
{\fs12}If she stays here, she'll be killed.

698
01:13:41,641 --> 01:13:43,487
讓她越境
{\fs12}Help me get her across.

699
01:13:49,431 --> 01:13:51,694
我幫不了你
{\fs12}I can't help you do that.

700
01:14:00,867 --> 01:14:02,840
做你該做的吧
{\fs12}You gotta do what you gotta do.

701
01:14:03,797 --> 01:14:05,328
我自己想辦法
{\fs12}I'll figure it out.

702
01:14:10,489 --> 01:14:11,758
祝好運
{\fs12}Good luck.

703
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:17,456
我得把你帶到北邊去

為什麼士兵懂手語
{\fs12}Why does a soldier know sign language?

730
01:19:51,010 --> 01:19:52,577
我女兒是聾子
{\fs12}My daughter was deaf.

731
01:20:01,366 --> 01:20:03,499
我知道你是誰
{\fs12}I know who you are.

732
01:20:07,716 --> 01:20:10,165
他們殺了那個律師 你是他家人
{\fs12}You're the attorney whose family they killed.

733
01:20:14,311 --> 01:20:16,209
不是"他們"
{\fs12}Not "they."

734
01:20:23,608 --> 01:20:25,306
我父親
{\fs12}My father.

735
01:20:27,032 --> 01:20:28,787
是他的一個手下
{\fs12}A man who worked for him.

736
01:20:37,056 --> 01:20:38,361
為什麼
{\fs12}Why?

737
01:20:40,629 --> 01:20:42,191
為了傳遞信息
{\fs12}To send a message.

738
01:20:44,980 --> 01:20:46,427
現在你獵殺他們
{\fs12}Now you hunt them...

739
01:20:48,137 --> 01:20:49,872
所以沒在傳遞信息
{\fs12}so you won't be a message.

740
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:54,710
我就是信息
{\fs12}I will always be a message.

741
01:20:55,814 --> 01:20:59,339
只是現在 信息換了一種方式
{\fs12}Only now, the message is different.

742
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:17,483
越境難嗎
{\fs12}Is the border hard to cross?

743
01:21:23,046 --> 01:21:24,073
可能
{\fs12}It could be...

744
01:21:25,549 --> 01:21:27,236
對於伊莎貝爾·雷耶斯而言
{\fs12}for Isabel Reyes.

我叫卡瑞娜

747
01:21:53,783 --> 01:21:55,594
你來自瓦哈卡州

748
01:22:02,941 --> 01:22:05,399
如果有人問起我

749
01:22:07,450 --> 01:22:11,245
就說你雇我扮你父親

750
01:22:14,806 --> 01:22:17,434
為什麼不直接說你是我父親

751
01:22:19,978 --> 01:22:22,606
因為你吹的牛和我的不一樣

752
01:22:23,573 --> 01:22:26,677
我們要吹同一個牛

753
01:22:31,991 --> 01:22:33,575
把你的鞋子給我

754
01:22:35,846 --> 01:22:37,438
幹什麼

755
01:22:38,671 --> 01:22:40,374
裝定位器

756
01:22:43,627 --> 01:22:46,113
以防我們分開

757
01:23:01,548 --> 01:23:03,898

{\fs12}No. I'll do it.

761
01:23:18,412 --> 01:23:20,998

{\fs12}'Cause if I don't, he'll probably come and kill you.

01:24:29,626 --> 01:24:30,467
好多人

763
01:24:32,025 --> 01:24:33,153

764
01:24:36,471 --> 01:24:37,908
管事的在哪

765
01:24:38,026 --> 01:24:39,935
他馬上就來

766
01:25:45,475 --> 01:25:49,187

01:26:09,374 --> 01:26:11,084
這個沒得討論

775
01:26:12,753 --> 01:26:15,839
