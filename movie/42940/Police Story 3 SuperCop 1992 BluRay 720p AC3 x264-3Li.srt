1
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:07,796
The pushers have improved...

2
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,433
on means of drug smuggling

3
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:13,072
Drugs are hidden in condoms

4
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,907
Stomachs, rectums or even corpses

5
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:20,073
Including babies' bodies

6
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,640
Last year alone...

7
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,947
there were 150 cases of deaths

8
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:27,880
Caused by drug poisoning due...

9
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:29,711
to puncture in condoms

10
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:32,084
However,

11
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:33,450
they were in the minority

12
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:37,219
Most traffickers succeeded in passing the Customs

13
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:38,488
To fight drug activities has been one

14
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:39,789
Of the most important tasks...

15
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:41,091
of HK Police

16
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:42,999
This info is already known to us

17
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,329
Will you please get to the point?

18
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:48,939
OK, most of the drugs circulating

19
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:51,804
Come from drug king Chaibat

20
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,439
Capturing him...

21
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:57,116
will at least halve the circulation

22
00:01:57,351 --> 00:01:59,979
In what aspect can the Royal HK police help you?

23
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,278
Yes, what we need is a super cop

24
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:05,750
Well, let me think about it.
I'll let you know tomorrow

25
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,624
Fix it for me, tell me tomorrow

26
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,665
Yes, sir

27
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:20,867
Superiors don't do things.

28
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,438
They give orders

29
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:23,768
Right

30
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:25,200
Fix it for me

31
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,305
I know already

32
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:32,614
Bring back Chia-chu right away

33
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:33,945
Yes, sir

34
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:36,488
Thank you

35
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:37,848
Yes, sir

36
00:02:58,745 --> 00:02:59,803
Morning, inspector Chen

37
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:00,711
Morning

38
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,878
Chia-chu, they're having a meeting

39
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:13,925
We mustn't let Chia-chu take up the mission

40
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,889
Why not? Isn't he responsible?

41
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:17,654
Yes, he is

42
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:18,887
Doesn't he obey his superiors?

43
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:21,493
Yes, except for the nastiest superior

44
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,235
You always claimed I didn't promote him

45
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,164
Now he's got a chance and you won't let him do it

46
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:26,597
Chance?

47
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,068
It's no fun infiltrating the Camp?

48
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:30,366
Are you afraid he can't make it?

49
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:32,868
No one can if he doesn't

50
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:34,876
It's a waste putting him...

51
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:36,207
on patrol

52
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,111
Now Interpol needs a super cop

53
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,080
He's a super cop,

54
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:41,445
but you won't let him do it

55
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:45,180
I know, but it's a most dangerous mission

56
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:46,892
He's followed me for so many yeas.

57
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,092
I can't let him take the risk!

58
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:50,795
Ok. We'll go...

59
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,292
and say 'no' to Interpol

60
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,555
None at the Royal HK Police...

61
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,199
can do it

62
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:56,868
Send for James Bond

63
00:03:58,538 --> 00:03:59,698
Good!

64
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:09,973
Inspector Chen

65
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:21,453
Uncle Piao

66
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,423
Chia-chu, come in

67
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:27,425
I want to see you

68
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:29,495
Sit down

69
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:30,925
What is it so urgent?

70
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:33,605
A position suits you most

71
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:38,400
The Inspector of Shataukok Police Hq. Sign it here

72
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,079
Uncle Piao, let me do it

73
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:42,574
I'm letting you do it

74
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:45,683
The air is fresh at Shataukok Police Hq

75
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:47,445
And you don't have to patrol

76
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,314
I mean the Interpol mission

77
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:50,612
Have you heard of it?

78
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:52,249
Let me do it

79
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:53,982
It's the most dangerous mission

80
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:57,488
When one is numbed...

81
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:58,696
by everyday routine

82
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,865
Sitting in office could be more dangerous

83
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,830
Do you have to consult May?

84
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:07,039
Not necessary. I've made the decision

85
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:11,003
Go and be prepared

86
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:13,204
Yes, sir

87
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:16,043
Chia-chu

88
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,044
Yes?

89
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,682
The Commissioner must be happy to know it

90
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,946
Are you unhappy?

91
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:22,985
I'd be happier if the Commissioner did it

92
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,132
Aren't we very mean?

93
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:38,796
A little bit, but you're the more so

94
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:40,163
Why?

95
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:42,132
Because you're my superior

96
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:46,240
Why have you to enter the camp so abruptly?

97
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:49,311
What training is that? Why didn't you call me?

98
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,877
A Special Training Camp.
I get a promotion after that

99
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:55,086
Aren't you happy for me?

100
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,483
Yes, since it's not a dangerous mission

101
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:02,559
It's safer in the camp involving no risk

102
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,858
My life insurance policy

103
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,233
My bank passbook

104
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,031
Why are you giving them to me?

105
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:14,667
You're the beneficiary. Come

106
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,441
What are you doing?

107
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,949
The key to the safe with foreign currency deposits

108
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,280
Why are you giving me all these?

109
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:31,888
Didn't you say you'd return very soon?

110
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,123
I'm afraid I may be late

111
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,622
Don't forget to pay the insurance premium for me

112
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,864
And renew the bank deposit when it matures

113
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:41,525
What are you doing?

114
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:42,860
One month!

115
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:44,195
You're late

116
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,029
They won't kill me for being late

117
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:03,149
Remember not to woo boys!

118
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,822
You'd better guard yourself against it!

119
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:06,214
May

120
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:08,383
- Uncle Piao      - Uncle Piao

121
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:13,057
I'll keep an eye on him for this month

122
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,625
Go now, bye-bye

123
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:15,959
Bye-bye

124
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:17,396
Bye-bye, Uncle Piao

125
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,102
Your certificate and air ticket for Canton

126
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:26,471
Yes, sir

127
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,479
Be on the alert

128
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:29,782
Don't worry,

129
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,348
the Chinese Public Security will help fully

130
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:33,745
That makes me worry the more

131
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:36,478
Uncle Piao, say something better, will you

132
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,917
Good luck!

133
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:40,991
In fact, the Royal HK police

134
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:45,527
are flying Chia-chu like a kite for this mission

135
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,666
It may break when the wind is gusty,
no one know where will it be

136
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:51,165
Don't make such daring parable

137
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:52,370
Don't worry.

138
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,436
I'll drift back if the string breaks

139
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:56,608
Chia-chu is up to the scratch, as I said

140
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:58,704
Good luck!

141
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,003
Thank you, sir

142
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,811
Uncle Piao, I'm leaving

143
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,047
Good luck!

144
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,652
- Yes, sir
- Chia-chu

145
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,049
Stop nagging

146
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,224
Call this number in case of emergency

147
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,386
Remember this number. Tear it in a minute

148
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:19,329
I've remembered it

149
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:20,863
- I'm leaving
- I'll tear it for you

150
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:22,865
I'm leaving

151
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:25,535
Thank you

152
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,807
I'm making a call. Don't disturb me

153
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:32,135
You're giving him my hone number!

154
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:34,741
OK, for everybody!

155
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,210
Please

156
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,591
Sit down

157
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:44,779
Are you the super cop from Hong Kong?

158
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,209
According to information from HK

159
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:52,922
Chen Chia-chu (super cop)

160
00:09:58,398 --> 00:09:59,330
Super cops in HK...

161
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,965
are cheap and plentiful

162
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:03,395
Like commodities in supermarkets

163
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,104
He's a modest young man

164
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:08,572
We're of one family.

165
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,332
We'll help you

166
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,577
Thank you

167
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,802
This is a dangerous mission

168
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:17,008
We must arrange to familiarize yourself

169
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,615
With conditions in China

170
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:20,911
What conditions?

171
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,188
Director of Interpol Yang will arrange it for you

172
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,591
This is our Director Yang

173
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,763
How do you do, Miss Yang?

174
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:40,832
Lear from her

175
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:42,506
Yes

176
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:43,833
Have a good chat

177
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,338
Yes, Commissar

178
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:56,354
So Director Yang is a beautiful lady

179
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,953
You may speak to me in Chinese

180
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:03,489
That's much better

181
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:05,728
Let's start

182
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:06,966
Okay

183
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,532
As of this minute, you're Lin Fu-sheng,

184
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,631
A merchandiser of Fu Shan State
5th Mechanical Factory

185
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:14,840
Understand?

186
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:15,972
Yes

187
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:18,177
Your uniform is presentable

188
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,639
Can civilians wear it?

189
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,341
You've been a member of Fu Shan Wu Shih Team

190
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:26,211
You're single and live at 17,
Chuan Yao Yu Village, Fu Shan

191
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:28,215
You have a mother and a sister

192
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:30,422
And your father died in 1978

193
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,419
Poor fellow lost his father so early

194
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:33,749
Remember that?

195
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:34,857
Yes

196
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,994
Well, repeat that to me

197
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:43,830
I'm Lin Fu-sheng, 32

198
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:50,066
Born in Fu Shan. I've been a Fu Shan Gymnastics...

199
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:52,038
A merchandiser of a mechanical factory

200
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,940
The merchandiser of a mechanical factory

201
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,705
Gymnastics sportsman

202
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,117
Fu Shan Wu Shih Team

203
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:01,417
Live in what village?

204
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:03,121
Chuan Yao Yu Village

205
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,084
This is hard to memorize

206
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:08,452
You're a super cop and you have no memory

207
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,593
It's the first time I came across it

208
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:12,728
If I were you, could you do it in one go?

209
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:13,933
I'm Chen Chia-chu,

210
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,031
born 7-4-1958

211
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:18,737
I joined the Royal HK Police in 1981

212
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:20,105
19...

213
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:22,273
1984 promoted to Trainee Inspector

214
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:25,705
Height 5'10", weight 73 kilos

215
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,276
Blood type: AB

216
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:28,936
I have nothing special,

217
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:30,876
but I've memorized your background

218
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:33,551
Memorize the way I do

219
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,382
Let's go for photographs

220
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:40,623
Photographs?

221
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,721
Isn't the Pearl River Bridge's
landscape more beautiful?

222
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,724
What then?

223
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:51,997
Put your hand here

224
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:59,104
Smile, look forward

225
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,437
What now?

226
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,282
Wu Shih team, not a Beijing Theatrical troupe

227
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:13,856
Make up again

228
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,419
Why didn't you say it earlier?

229
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:23,168
Your turn

230
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,267
Feet, a bit apart

231
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,775
Look forward, OK

232
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:53,188
Film is called plastic rolls.
Walkman is called Sui Sheng Ting

233
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:54,694
Soft drink can is...

234
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:55,956
Yi La can

235
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:57,191
Yi La can

236
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:01,971
Public Security is No. 2.
Military Policeman is No. 1

237
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,142
Guns are Huo Pao

238
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,981
So many men? Are they all yours?

239
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,151
They're grandad's

240
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:15,149
Who's grandad?

241
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:17,481
The State, but I'm in command

242
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:18,985
Chen Chia-chu

243
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:20,021
Yes?

244
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:23,194
Chen Chia-chu's dead. You're Lin Fu-sheng

245
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,926
Don't set me up

246
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,689
You're going to face a much craftier enemy

247
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:29,526
You must be on your guard

248
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,367
When are we going to set out?

249
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,269
Acting on a tip-off,

250
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,513
Chaibat has bought desperadoes

251
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:43,443
To rescue him from the Labor Camp

252
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,047
We're now stalling for time

253
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,784
Only these few photos will do?

254
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,452
Don't you know the advances in science?

255
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,921
Yes, but I don't look like one
from the Wu Shih team

256
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,784
The file says you're a wrestling champion

257
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,585
Not really wrestling. Pulling and whatever

258
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:59,388
We learned karate, taekwondo

259
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:03,629
Boxing, Chinese kung fu...

260
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,462
I didn't learn it

261
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,216
This is breath control?

262
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:31,123
Didn't you learn it?

263
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:34,456
No, what an idiot standing to get beaten

264
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:40,904
Director Yang

265
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,005
Comrade Wang, let me make the introduction

266
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,504
The Chief Coach of our Military Police

267
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,905
A super cop from Hong Kong

268
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,340
Super Cop? Must be powerful

269
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,015
She compliments me only!

270
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:53,250
No

271
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:55,681
He's Taekwondo section 7, Hapkido section 8

272
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,786
Karate section 9, judo section 10

273
00:15:58,024 --> 00:16:00,584
And twice the wrestling champion in Southeast Asia

274
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,188
What do you expect of me?

275
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,020
I must taste it

276
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,029
Sure

277
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:08,864
Stop practicing!

278
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:11,597
All for the assembly!

279
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,307
Sit down!

280
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:30,680
Please

281
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,449
What a mischief you've played on me

282
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:38,630
Let's welcome super cop from Hong Kong

283
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:45,732
Come

284
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:48,032
Don't make so much fun

285
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:49,205
It's all right

286
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:50,898
Will he fight for real?

287
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,542
No

288
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:54,336
Stop it if anything happens

289
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,038
No

290
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:06,317
It's only for fun

291
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:13,031
Sorry

292
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,008
Brave! You've lived up to your name!

293
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,270
Again, again

294
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:37,675
Thank you

295
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:39,945
Let's go on a little longer

296
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,020
How is it operated?

297
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:46,787
Simple. Grasping above with both hands,
feet over here

298
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:48,186
I push you

299
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:59,029
How is it stopped?

300
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:22,725
Next time call me the World Champion of Somersault

301
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,054
No more fun. Our mission begins

302
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:26,628
Do I look like having fun?

303
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:53,252
There are 3 trucks with 6 men

304
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,921
You remember the direction of the coal mine?

305
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,856
Yes, everything

306
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,662
My only forte is a good memory

307
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,368
Is that so? Remember the position
of the overhead tunnel

308
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:05,365
Don't worry. I attach more importance to this

309
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:07,572
Tell your men not to shoot wantonly

310
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,102
Part of the guards have no bullets

311
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,036
You two go down and be ready

312
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:14,744
I count on you. Look at me

313
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:16,706
Watch out

314
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,599
Why do you stop? Back to work quick!

315
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:53,780
Panther, let's proceed as planned

316
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:14,766
Why are you hitting me?

317
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:26,409
Panther

318
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:48,830
Sir

319
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:49,767
Not necessary

320
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:51,208
- Thank you      - Switch off the engine

321
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,472
Only a routine check-up

322
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:56,208
Quick, quick!

323
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,178
Go backward to have a look

324
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,857
Be ready to start

325
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,162
What is it up above?

326
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:13,729
Nothing but coal

327
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,227
Coal?

328
00:22:19,238 --> 00:22:20,227
Sir

329
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,405
Nothing, sir

330
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,317
Hua, start off quickly!

331
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:34,519
Hua, start off quickly!

332
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:36,854
Hua, hurry up!

333
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,351
Hua

334
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:40,684
Panther, get up

335
00:22:46,232 --> 00:22:47,256
Panther, go now

336
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,057
Don't go!

337
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,692
Panther

338
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:53,268
Go now

339
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:03,375
Panther, wait for me

340
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:05,243
I don't know him!

341
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:06,518
Hsiung

342
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,719
Hsiung

343
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,716
Crazy, run!

344
00:23:17,363 --> 00:23:18,455
What did Hsiung say just now?

345
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:19,764
He said he didn't know the direction

346
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:20,555
Don't you?

347
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,096
Yes, go upward

348
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:24,229
So high. How are we to go up?

349
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,528
Jump!

350
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:27,899
Go upward

351
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,101
Panther, get going

352
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,576
Going up from here is an overhead tunnel

353
00:24:09,515 --> 00:24:10,641
Jump and I'll turn on the switch

354
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:11,974
OK

355
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,416
Hurry up!

356
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:30,265
Turn off the switch!

357
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:31,997
Follow me

358
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:35,139
Quick!

359
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,710
They're keeping up. Quick!

360
00:24:41,113 --> 00:24:42,205
Don't shoot!

361
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:44,007
Follow them

362
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:54,048
Quick, quick!

363
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,489
Why does it stop?

364
00:24:58,731 --> 00:24:59,857
I don't know

365
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:02,397
What now?

366
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:03,561
I don't know

367
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:08,162
Get off from here

368
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:11,836
Run!

369
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:20,914
Stop! Don't run!

370
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,518
Run!

371
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:39,161
What?

372
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:44,068
Is this the overhead tunnel?

373
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:45,773
What are you looking for?

374
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,535
An underground tunnel

375
00:25:49,415 --> 00:25:51,713
Too late, run now!

376
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:05,287
- Run and I'll shoot!      - Run!

377
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:29,385
Overhead tunnel!

378
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,079
Are you okay?

379
00:26:32,658 --> 00:26:33,556
Yes

380
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:34,884
Go

381
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,163
After this mountain,

382
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,428
get to town through the main street

383
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:51,632
Bye-bye

384
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:54,241
Where are you going?

385
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:57,475
Hsiung paid me $2,000...

386
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:59,239
to bring you here only

387
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:00,452
The rest I don't care

388
00:27:00,686 --> 00:27:02,916
You're OK in kung fu

389
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:04,354
Take me to town,

390
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,147
and I'll take you to HK for a big deal

391
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,794
Hong Kong's so far away. Forget it

392
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,827
Pay me $500 more and I'll take you to town

393
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:13,189
I haven't got so much

394
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:16,798
Once in HK, I can pay you up to $ 50,000

395
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:20,163
I don't blame you as we're strangers,
but do trust me

396
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:25,667
OK, pay me $50,000 once we're in HK

397
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:27,844
No problem, count on me

398
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,847
Hurry, it's going to rain

399
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:32,643
Why are you following Hsiung?

400
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,475
I follow anybody that pays

401
00:27:35,621 --> 00:27:37,111
Where's your home town?

402
00:27:37,556 --> 00:27:38,454
Fu Shan

403
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:39,554
Fu Shan

404
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:12,049
Don't you raise pigs in the country?

405
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:16,753
The pigs in our country eat vegetables

406
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,657
The pigs here eat feed, and they stink

407
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,437
Panther

408
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,682
A friend

409
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:49,353
Panther

410
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,457
Come out, everybody, panther's back

411
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,396
Panther, you're back?

412
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,594
Panther

413
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:58,563
Bring a towel quick!

414
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:01,769
You've thinned!

415
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:04,264
Panther, it's nice you're out.
You must've suffered

416
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:08,570
Never. It was like holiday in the camp

417
00:29:08,814 --> 00:29:10,805
You're big brother where you are

418
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,983
Yes, yes

419
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:19,223
How did I slip last time?

420
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,752
Fishball

421
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,152
I know nothing

422
00:29:25,664 --> 00:29:27,894
Sha Pi, what happened to our cargo?

423
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:29,498
Confiscated by Public Security

424
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:35,970
Panther, I didn't do it

425
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:39,335
Don't! panther, sorry

426
00:29:39,845 --> 00:29:41,938
My fault, sorry

427
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:45,106
Panther, give me a break

428
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,917
Don't, brother!

429
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:48,619
Give me a break!

430
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:06,861
Let me introduce Fu-Sheng,

431
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:08,436
our brother

432
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:13,875
What about the cargo from Yunnan?

433
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:15,511
Arriving in a couple of days

434
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:18,516
Panther, let's get out of here quick

435
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:22,548
Isn't Fu Shan your home town?

436
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:23,719
Go and visit your folks while...

437
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:25,718
we still have time

438
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:27,150
Okay

439
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,627
Sha Pi, Fishball, follow me

440
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:31,726
The others, same old place
after receipt of the cargo

441
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:33,157
Yes

442
00:30:33,699 --> 00:30:35,564
- Let's go      - Let's go

443
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,476
Fu-Sheng

444
00:30:46,745 --> 00:30:48,736
Come up. Panther's calling you

445
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,140
What is it?

446
00:30:50,382 --> 00:30:51,314
Where is it?

447
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:52,639
Not yet there

448
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:55,583
Isn't this Fu Shan?

449
00:30:57,823 --> 00:31:00,223
I know, but not yet my home

450
00:31:01,727 --> 00:31:03,922
Which of the cross-road in front?

451
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:07,529
Cross-road? Just move along

452
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:23,673
Where is it?

453
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:25,780
Public Security from behind. Move quickly!

454
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,045
Fu-Sheng

455
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,052
Is Public Security following?

456
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:35,191
Don't worry. Where is it?

457
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:37,224
I live...

458
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:39,394
You don't know where you live?

459
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:42,361
I've been away 3 years. Much has changed

460
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:43,863
You must still have some impression

461
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:48,630
Sure, but there are now more buildings

462
00:31:55,881 --> 00:31:58,816
Panther, come

463
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:10,723
Uncle Fu-Sheng

464
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:14,594
Granny missed me. Come home quick!

465
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:18,468
My nephew

466
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:19,431
Come back, come

467
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:22,003
Auntie, Fu-Sheng's back

468
00:32:24,176 --> 00:32:25,837
Fu-Sheng, you're back

469
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:29,776
Good. Let me take you to see your mammy

470
00:32:30,015 --> 00:32:31,243
My auntie

471
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:32,943
This way

472
00:32:33,185 --> 00:32:34,743
Not this way, that way

473
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:36,510
I know. Let me take it for you

474
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,086
Not necessary. Please follow me

475
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:41,081
Panther, this way

476
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:44,518
Fu-Sheng, your mammy must be happy...

477
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,286
seeing you back after those years

478
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:49,864
I missed you

479
00:32:50,836 --> 00:32:52,133
Fu-Sheng

480
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,364
Must be doing fine

481
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,199
Of course

482
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:02,709
See your mammy. She missed you

483
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:07,780
Madam, madam

484
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,108
Why is she out of sight?

485
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:11,049
Fu-Sheng, take care of your friends

486
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:12,119
Your mammy must've fallen asleep

487
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:13,988
Panther, sit down, make yourself at home

488
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:15,784
Sit down

489
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:17,219
I need it!

490
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:18,861
Fu-Sheng, where's the toilet?

491
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:21,788
Outside, turn

492
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:23,330
Just do it when there's no one around

493
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:25,559
People do it anywhere in the country

494
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:28,164
Fu-Sheng, who's that girl?

495
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:29,998
Girl? Which one?

496
00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:31,641
This

497
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,242
Which one?

498
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,207
That girl in the photo with you

499
00:33:37,082 --> 00:33:38,208
Your wife?

500
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,312
She's...

501
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:43,879
Brother, you're back!

502
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:47,423
My sister

503
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,422
Your sister?

504
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:50,661
Yes

505
00:33:50,896 --> 00:33:52,830
Brother, when did you come back?

506
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:58,092
Sister, it's been years. You're much taller

507
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:03,237
And more beautiful, and plumper

508
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:07,035
You're squeezing me so hard!

509
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:08,604
You siblings are getting on OK

510
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,778
Yes

511
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:10,679
Greet Panther

512
00:34:10,682 --> 00:34:11,512
Panther

513
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,546
What's your name, please?

514
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:13,210
My name's Hua

515
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:14,418
She's named Hua

516
00:34:14,686 --> 00:34:17,280
Bring tea for Panther, quick

517
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:19,889
We've been fighting since childhood

518
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:21,689
Undress and you feel better

519
00:34:21,927 --> 00:34:23,053
Fu-Sheng

520
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:25,359
Brat,

521
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:29,556
it's been a long time

522
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:33,464
You have such long moustache

523
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,762
Thanks, auntie

524
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,905
Just say plenty

525
00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:40,270
Plenty. He's Fu-Sheng, your son

526
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:42,069
Yes. Mammy, I'm back

527
00:34:42,314 --> 00:34:45,215
Fu-Sheng, I've been waiting for you for ages

528
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,441
Even a fortune...

529
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:50,882
is not enough for you

530
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:53,420
Have you brought any money?

531
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,559
Money! Only money fascinates you

532
00:34:56,795 --> 00:34:59,263
Brother knows better. Sit down

533
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:02,089
Sit down

534
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,593
Panther, have some tea

535
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,163
Have some tea

536
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:12,231
Got a watch?

537
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:13,967
No

538
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:15,769
Got any money then?

539
00:35:16,014 --> 00:35:17,003
Neither

540
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:19,307
- No money and no watch
- Yes, yes

541
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:20,414
Money?

542
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:21,680
Auntie,

543
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,443
from Fu-Sheng

544
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:25,952
For me? What money is that?

545
00:35:26,658 --> 00:35:27,647
Hong Kong dollars

546
00:35:27,926 --> 00:35:29,518
Hong Kong dollar is valuable

547
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:33,855
Hua, go and buy two chickens

548
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:36,366
Let me treat you to a chicken meal

549
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,159
Now security is bad...

550
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,366
Tai

551
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,870
- My sister. Tai, Chiang      - Tai, Chiang

552
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,109
Let me make the introduction. My mammy

553
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:46,867
Mammy

554
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:49,305
He's greeting you

555
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:50,514
Me?

556
00:35:50,782 --> 00:35:51,544
Let me make the introduction

557
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:55,109
Okay, that won't be necessary

558
00:35:55,387 --> 00:35:59,346
Where are you going? It's dinner time

559
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:00,955
I'm taking Fu-Sheng to town to eat

560
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:04,684
Brat, rushing away without eating

561
00:36:04,963 --> 00:36:06,521
I'm taking him to make money

562
00:36:06,865 --> 00:36:11,063
Make money? Take Hua with you

563
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:12,800
OK, I'll go and change

564
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:14,563
Take Hua?

565
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,033
Yes, take her

566
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:18,806
Eat first. We'll come back soon

567
00:36:19,044 --> 00:36:21,069
Plain chicken

568
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:22,973
Bye-bye, mammy

569
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:48,271
Here people love wild life as food

570
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,906
Even those any animals...

571
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,575
protected or near extinction

572
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:01,511
Hua, order anything you like

573
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,716
Panther, they're here

574
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:11,686
So cruel? Why does Public Security do nothing?

575
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,702
Panther's here

576
00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:26,101
Panther

577
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:29,376
Sit. Hua, sit over here

578
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:34,580
Have some tea, panther

579
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:36,943
They're...

580
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:40,984
My brother Fu-Sheng, Hua

581
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:46,886
You two sit over there

582
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:51,167
Go now

583
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:08,076
Don't look

584
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,482
I seem to have seen Grizzly Bear before

585
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,251
Thank you

586
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:17,586
Those at the entrance are Public Security men

587
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,457
Are they your men?

588
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:22,127
Of course not

589
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:23,926
He looks...

590
00:38:24,169 --> 00:38:26,763
like the fugitive from Labor Camp

591
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:29,132
Panther can't afford getting caught
by Public Security now

592
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,202
I know

593
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:34,603
It's your territory, do something

594
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:36,006
Okay

595
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:39,149
Let me go over to check on him

596
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:40,506
You two watch here;

597
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:42,275
I'll get some more men

598
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,018
What will you have?

599
00:38:49,294 --> 00:38:50,886
Civet cat steamed with turtle organs

600
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:53,519
What?

601
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,826
Civet steamed with turtle organs

602
00:38:56,234 --> 00:38:57,667
Order one more pot

603
00:38:59,571 --> 00:39:00,902
One more pot

604
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:05,566
I'm Captain Chen Hsiang-Tung calling Hq. Read me?

605
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:07,203
Roger. Please speak

606
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:08,206
I've now found...

607
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:10,709
Comrade, I'm Captain Yang Chien-Hua of Interpol

608
00:39:10,982 --> 00:39:12,347
Don't arrest those men inside

609
00:39:12,584 --> 00:39:13,551
Any certificate?

610
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:14,716
I haven't brought along

611
00:39:14,986 --> 00:39:17,318
No? Turn round, hands up!

612
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,582
Let's go out to see the cargo

613
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:23,224
They've left

614
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:26,863
Too late, let's go and check him!

615
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:36,872
Interpol Director Yang Chien-Hua calling Hq

616
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,607
Roger, please speak

617
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:43,412
Waiter

618
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:47,584
Stop! We're Public Security!

619
00:40:21,653 --> 00:40:23,712
Stop, all of you! We're Public Security

620
00:41:11,536 --> 00:41:12,525
Be careful!

621
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,644
Can you throw?

622
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:24,643
At least he's scared too

623
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,508
Keep away!

624
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:29,719
What are you doing? Public Security

625
00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:37,059
What are you doing?

626
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,158
Hua hasn't got away yet!

627
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:39,727
Run before trying something

628
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:43,391
Stay where you are!

629
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:45,194
Take them back!

630
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,728
Director Yang

631
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:51,638
Run and I'll shoot!

632
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:53,638
Halt!

633
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:55,479
It's OK here. Go out

634
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,548
Lin Fu-Sheng, so it's you

635
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:03,150
You robbed the Food Collection Station
and the People's Bank

636
00:42:03,421 --> 00:42:05,013
You really have the guts!

637
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:06,587
And you've taken in an accomplice?

638
00:42:07,392 --> 00:42:08,882
Come back with me!

639
00:42:17,335 --> 00:42:18,734
Run quickly, run!

640
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:20,937
Run quickly!

641
00:42:24,409 --> 00:42:25,774
Captain, thank you

642
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:29,836
Panther, Hua!

643
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:33,910
Come back quickly! Want to get jailed again?

644
00:42:34,185 --> 00:42:35,846
Hua, hurry up!

645
00:42:44,195 --> 00:42:45,287
Hurry up!

646
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,059
Bloody Grizzly Bear really is careless!

647
00:42:54,372 --> 00:42:57,364
Hua, you're OK, you're great

648
00:42:58,743 --> 00:42:59,641
What are you doing?

649
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:00,969
I killed one Public Security man!

650
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,240
What's so serious?

651
00:43:03,481 --> 00:43:05,039
He'd have killed you if you didn't

652
00:43:05,283 --> 00:43:06,375
One gets executed for this

653
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:07,982
I know. What now?

654
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,651
Don't worry, go with me to Hong Kong

655
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:10,945
Okay

656
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:12,814
Are you really taking her to Hong Kong?

657
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:13,989
If I can take you,

658
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,282
I can take her too

659
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,050
I can't let her get captured

660
00:43:17,295 --> 00:43:18,455
Thank you, Panther

661
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,424
You two are fantastic

662
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:22,724
Let's go

663
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:25,663
Electric rod, I must buy one to bring to HK

664
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,732
Did you really kill a Public Security man?

665
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:31,305
Yes

666
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,303
I can come in?

667
00:44:11,782 --> 00:44:13,977
You're rude. Come in

668
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:16,379
I'm your brother

669
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:22,683
What is it?

670
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,052
Why do you suddenly follow us?

671
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,352
It's an order from above

672
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:26,858
Do they know it?

673
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:28,223
I can't take care of you

674
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,524
They told me to take care of you

675
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:34,627
You'll only be my millstone

676
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:36,237
Don't be a male chauvinist

677
00:44:37,642 --> 00:44:38,734
The above...

678
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,205
Fu-Sheng, what happened?

679
00:44:41,479 --> 00:44:43,970
A womenfolk talks back and I can't stop her

680
00:44:44,215 --> 00:44:45,182
I'm now teaching her a lesson

681
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:46,508
What? Womenfolk?

682
00:44:46,751 --> 00:44:49,811
Chairman Mao said women hold half of the sky

683
00:44:50,054 --> 00:44:51,078
Did Chairman Mao say that?

684
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,186
Stop quarreling, you siblings

685
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:55,824
There's a observation post. Switch off the light

686
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,425
Come and lend a hand

687
00:45:00,665 --> 00:45:01,825
You hit your brother so hard

688
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:03,590
Would you be nicer if I were your husband?

689
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:05,432
Why didn't you say so earlier?

690
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:16,903
We're Royal HK Police

691
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:20,446
We order you to stop for inspection

692
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:26,254
Stop!

693
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:32,886
Fu-Sheng

694
00:45:58,155 --> 00:45:59,884
There are hidden layers!

695
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:06,956
Go quick to the rear!

696
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,438
Fei, go and see. Let me

697
00:46:25,016 --> 00:46:27,484
Panther, two motors have broken down

698
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:29,152
Don't expect to capture me, never!

699
00:46:37,662 --> 00:46:38,924
Panther, don't!

700
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:40,630
Don't stand in my way. Get away!

701
00:46:54,879 --> 00:46:55,777
Panther

702
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:56,678
Keep away, or I'll hit you!

703
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:01,611
The speed craft is rushing over!

704
00:47:14,899 --> 00:47:16,491
Having fun with me?

705
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:55,271
Panther, Panther

706
00:47:56,674 --> 00:47:57,732
Panther is coming up

707
00:48:04,415 --> 00:48:05,609
Pierre

708
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,852
Panther, you're back at last. How's everything?

709
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:09,848
Safe and sound

710
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:10,951
- Good      - Where's big brother?

711
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:11,745
He's waiting for you

712
00:48:11,756 --> 00:48:12,415
Let me go up to see him

713
00:48:12,423 --> 00:48:13,890
OK

714
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:19,858
Hi, sweetheart, can I join you, girls?

715
00:48:20,297 --> 00:48:21,559
Come and join us then

716
00:48:21,799 --> 00:48:23,562
I got some new stuff for you

717
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:26,227
Who wants to try first?

718
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,700
Come on, give me a hand

719
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,271
Fu-Sheng, come

720
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:35,474
Relax, you'll have a wonderful time

721
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:37,043
OK

722
00:48:38,983 --> 00:48:43,647
Just close your eyes and you'll enjoy

723
00:48:59,837 --> 00:49:01,395
Big brother

724
00:49:03,007 --> 00:49:04,099
Panther

725
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:05,432
Sit down

726
00:49:05,676 --> 00:49:07,075
Let me finish this game first. It's fun!

727
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:14,778
You look ruddy, must've been well fed

728
00:49:15,019 --> 00:49:16,111
Only because we got away quickly

729
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:19,520
Aren't you introducing 2 new men to us?

730
00:49:19,824 --> 00:49:20,620
Yes.

731
00:49:20,858 --> 00:49:23,656
I owed it to them to have returned safely

732
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:25,685
Game over again

733
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:29,131
Which ones?

734
00:49:31,502 --> 00:49:34,027
This is Fu-Sheng, that's Hua

735
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:40,332
Dump them into the sea!

736
00:49:40,611 --> 00:49:41,373
What?

737
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:43,312
Dump them into the sea!

738
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:46,680
Big brother

739
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:50,042
You got dumb in prison? You've no more vigilance

740
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:51,879
Bringing two police to see me?

741
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:55,021
Dump them into the sea!

742
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:09,628
Don't move!

743
00:50:09,874 --> 00:50:10,738
Fu-Sheng

744
00:50:11,876 --> 00:50:12,740
Hua

745
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:16,076
Panther, I thought of joining you for big jobs

746
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:17,880
But your big brother treats us this way

747
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:20,475
I'll give you some face

748
00:50:22,653 --> 00:50:23,813
Let's go

749
00:50:24,255 --> 00:50:25,153
What a fine opportunity

750
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:26,356
The gun has no bullets

751
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:27,522
How do you know?

752
00:50:45,676 --> 00:50:48,702
People in our line must be vigilant

753
00:50:49,914 --> 00:50:51,279
I like you both

754
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:53,941
Welcome to join us

755
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:55,685
Go and thank big brother

756
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,212
Thank you, big brother

757
00:50:59,957 --> 00:51:02,289
Big brother, that woman died of over dose

758
00:51:03,627 --> 00:51:05,527
So what?

759
00:51:05,763 --> 00:51:08,630
Johnny know how to stuff cocaine into corpses

760
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,457
Ask him if he can use this stiff

761
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:11,792
Yes

762
00:51:12,703 --> 00:51:15,297
It pays to make use of waste material

763
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:20,474
What's your name?

764
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:21,802
My name is Hua

765
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,947
Take her down to try that bullet-proof vest

766
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:27,547
Okay, follow me

767
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,588
Good, Hua will follow me tomorrow

768
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:34,423
Let me break the record first

769
00:51:37,628 --> 00:51:38,492
Panther,

770
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,491
what big deals require bullet-proof vests?

771
00:51:40,798 --> 00:51:41,890
I'll tell you then

772
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:43,929
Come and see brother play video game

773
00:51:46,904 --> 00:51:48,667
Big brother, Scar Chiang double-crossed Kun.

774
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,600
Drown him?

775
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:52,265
Do according to rules

776
00:51:57,014 --> 00:51:57,946
Big brother,

777
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,643
solicitor Chen just called long distance

778
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,281
- Solicitor Chen?      - Yes

779
00:52:10,761 --> 00:52:12,160
Out of the way!

780
00:52:14,365 --> 00:52:15,593
Dump him down!

781
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,605
He double-crossed big brother

782
00:52:27,044 --> 00:52:28,375
He asked for it

783
00:52:30,948 --> 00:52:32,313
Come up

784
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,719
Big brother, a call for you

785
00:52:55,205 --> 00:52:57,639
Whether we can win this lawsuit is immaterial

786
00:52:58,409 --> 00:53:01,173
But you must get back
the bank code from her

787
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:04,639
Not just try, you must

788
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:10,313
I know what to do if you do it well

789
00:53:52,262 --> 00:53:53,286
General

790
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:59,062
Welcome, Chaibat

791
00:54:18,822 --> 00:54:23,054
Poor crop in the Golden Triangle;

792
00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:24,826
too much rain

793
00:54:25,162 --> 00:54:26,288
I'm afraid I have no stuff for you

794
00:54:26,563 --> 00:54:27,495
Where are they?

795
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:29,630
The 30% I got can't meet the demand

796
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:33,961
I don't care what you guys want. I want 3 tons

797
00:54:34,238 --> 00:54:38,334
You heard it. The two of them got 50%

798
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:40,167
Give all the rest to me

799
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:43,345
Sorry, I've already taken the other half

800
00:54:43,747 --> 00:54:45,078
The others have no share

801
00:54:45,315 --> 00:54:48,148
Are you the one to dictate?

802
00:54:48,418 --> 00:54:50,181
You think you're President Bush?

803
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:57,523
All I want to say now...

804
00:54:57,795 --> 00:54:59,126
is no stuff this year

805
00:55:01,265 --> 00:55:02,857
So you met...

806
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,192
to take away my cut

807
00:55:05,536 --> 00:55:08,505
Business is business! Does my dough stink?

808
00:55:10,274 --> 00:55:13,937
Who dares to say that?

809
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:17,305
But who didn't pay...

810
00:55:17,548 --> 00:55:20,881
for the last batch?

811
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,778
I didn't

812
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:25,214
I have lots of money in a Swiss bank

813
00:55:25,722 --> 00:55:27,314
But somebody tipped off...

814
00:55:27,558 --> 00:55:28,684
the Malaysian police

815
00:55:28,959 --> 00:55:30,324
They arrested my wife

816
00:55:30,561 --> 00:55:31,994
So I owed you the money

817
00:55:32,229 --> 00:55:35,665
Your wife got arrested by Malaysian police?

818
00:55:36,033 --> 00:55:38,001
She might squeal

819
00:55:51,415 --> 00:55:52,575
Don't use violence!

820
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:55,250
Chaibat, talk, don't use violence!

821
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:56,543
He's the informer!

822
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,811
You can say anything. What have you got?

823
00:55:59,056 --> 00:56:01,217
What have I got?

824
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:06,689
General, good stuff!

825
00:56:13,904 --> 00:56:14,836
What happened?

826
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:15,827
This is big brother's signal

827
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:16,999
Let me see

828
00:56:21,912 --> 00:56:22,742
Stop, don't move!

829
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:24,744
Don't shoot

830
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:27,179
It's all dynamite inside the clothes!

831
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:28,179
One shot,

832
00:56:28,418 --> 00:56:29,942
and you'll all perish with me

833
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,118
Big brother

834
00:56:32,122 --> 00:56:33,453
Is my sister okay?

835
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:35,954
Don't worry, she's safe with big brother

836
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:37,917
Fix those two...

837
00:56:38,428 --> 00:56:39,895
if you hear the bang

838
00:56:41,098 --> 00:56:41,928
Okay?

839
00:56:42,199 --> 00:56:42,756
Yes

840
00:56:42,766 --> 00:56:44,063
Okay

841
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:45,859
Drop the gun!

842
00:56:50,707 --> 00:56:52,106
Don't ever try to rob me...

843
00:56:52,376 --> 00:56:53,900
of my share

844
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:56,209
Double-cross me?

845
00:56:57,114 --> 00:56:59,309
Chaibat, don't ever misunderstand

846
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:01,140
I'm in business

847
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:03,215
Talk over your personal grudge

848
00:57:03,553 --> 00:57:06,317
Before speaking to me

849
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:07,982
Let's go out

850
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:10,323
General, general

851
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:13,385
It's me. What now?

852
00:57:15,132 --> 00:57:16,895
None of you must get out of this house!

853
00:57:17,668 --> 00:57:19,761
Surround the house quickly!

854
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:24,937
I've endured enough,

855
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:26,802
you won't get out here alive

856
00:57:27,177 --> 00:57:28,667
Shoot if you have the nerve

857
00:59:10,781 --> 00:59:12,373
Fu-Sheng, finish him off!

858
00:59:22,626 --> 00:59:23,718
Give it to me

859
00:59:31,368 --> 00:59:32,699
Where's my sister?

860
00:59:35,872 --> 00:59:36,896
Chaibat

861
00:59:51,121 --> 00:59:52,884
Fire if you've the guts!

862
01:00:05,402 --> 01:00:07,336
Hold me!

863
01:00:10,774 --> 01:00:11,638
Let go!

864
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:22,418
Watch this side for me!

865
01:00:22,652 --> 01:00:23,949
What are you doing then?

866
01:00:27,424 --> 01:00:28,686
You took off the bullet-proof vest, why?

867
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:33,088
It's full of dynamite!

868
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:34,627
Dynamite? That creep!

869
01:00:34,865 --> 01:00:35,524
I mustn't get hit

870
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:37,130
I mustn't get hit too

871
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:40,535
Run quickly!

872
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:42,097
Go in

873
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:46,036
I shouldn't have brought you here

874
01:00:49,112 --> 01:00:49,874
You really are clumsy!

875
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:50,972
You are clumsy yourself!

876
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:52,181
See if anything can be used

877
01:00:53,183 --> 01:00:54,275
It has no bullets

878
01:00:55,886 --> 01:00:57,148
Catch!

879
01:00:57,821 --> 01:01:00,619
Move, and I shoot!

880
01:01:00,857 --> 01:01:01,551
What did he say?

881
01:01:01,825 --> 01:01:03,190
No idea. I guess they daren't shoot

882
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:04,324
I count to 3...

883
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:04,850
and we feign to throw grenades

884
01:01:04,861 --> 01:01:06,158
- 1, 2, 3
- what did you say?

885
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:12,157
Feign to throw grenades!

886
01:01:12,402 --> 01:01:14,302
Next time speak more clearly

887
01:01:52,409 --> 01:01:54,377
Chaibat, come out!

888
01:02:01,117 --> 01:02:02,880
What's it so serious, general?

889
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:06,111
You take the law into your own hands in my area

890
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:07,884
You're not giving me face

891
01:02:08,124 --> 01:02:10,115
You aren't giving me any either

892
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:14,219
You didn't help me over this

893
01:02:14,864 --> 01:02:18,095
Blaming me! What am I to say to the others?

894
01:02:18,535 --> 01:02:21,129
You don't have to

895
01:02:22,305 --> 01:02:24,432
As of now, I'll buy all the stuff here

896
01:02:25,108 --> 01:02:27,303
I'll make good to you this loss

897
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:30,273
A compensation alone can't settle everything

898
01:02:31,781 --> 01:02:33,715
I can't help if you don't agree

899
01:02:34,918 --> 01:02:36,818
But I know you're smart

900
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:39,279
I wouldn't have come unprepared

901
01:02:39,556 --> 01:02:43,925
Look around if your eyes are still good

902
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:56,766
Well, I won't push you too hard

903
01:02:57,007 --> 01:03:00,067
But I can't decide on you cornering...

904
01:03:00,343 --> 01:03:01,571
the stuff here

905
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:04,245
Do you have to see Mr. Chin Sha?

906
01:03:04,748 --> 01:03:07,342
If you lead, I don't mind going with you

907
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:09,915
Prepare the helicopter

908
01:03:10,153 --> 01:03:11,313
Yes

909
01:03:15,825 --> 01:03:16,917
Is it OK?

910
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:19,453
Chaibat

911
01:03:21,765 --> 01:03:24,029
You gave my sister a dynamite-laced vest?

912
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:25,700
What if she really got hit?

913
01:03:26,002 --> 01:03:27,299
Stay where you are!

914
01:03:30,206 --> 01:03:32,436
None dare you to talk to me in this tone!

915
01:03:36,613 --> 01:03:37,545
Hua

916
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:39,304
You scum!

917
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:42,284
Hua

918
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:51,286
You'd have died
if it weren't for a bullet-proof vest

919
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:53,652
I won't treat my brothers this way

920
01:03:53,897 --> 01:03:56,695
You two kids really are okay

921
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:01,993
Chaibat, you're great. Please

922
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:08,902
Take them to Malaysia and wait for me

923
01:04:09,713 --> 01:04:10,907
Have a good time

924
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:21,984
Scum, I'll get him sooner of later!

925
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:39,508
Miss Cheng, Mr. Chaibat sends you his regards

926
01:04:39,743 --> 01:04:41,108
Did you come here to say this only?

927
01:04:41,411 --> 01:04:44,869
Whatever the verdict, we can still appeal

928
01:04:45,281 --> 01:04:46,908
I know the law here well

929
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:50,353
He has good reason to set your mind at ease

930
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:51,948
No point in saying only

931
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:54,914
He wants me to get...

932
01:04:55,191 --> 01:04:57,557
the code to your Swiss bank account

933
01:04:57,794 --> 01:04:59,887
I'll tell him when I see him

934
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:22,379
Get a clearer idea of what's around here

935
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:28,152
Let me take a photo for you, here

936
01:05:29,826 --> 01:05:31,726
Come on, smile

937
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:35,492
Go over there for a look

938
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:47,408
Fu-Sheng, this is most important

939
01:06:00,657 --> 01:06:02,454
Please come over this way

940
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:09,161
Welcome, ladies & gentlemen, to Merdeka Square

941
01:06:14,838 --> 01:06:16,499
Get acquainted with surroundings
of this street

942
01:06:21,845 --> 01:06:23,642
Come, let's go over there

943
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:32,614
The serious criminals take this route to the Court

944
01:06:33,356 --> 01:06:34,380
Take a closer look

945
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:37,023
Panther, would you tell us why?

946
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:41,160
We'll tell you then

947
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:43,329
Come, let's take a look at the junction

948
01:06:57,213 --> 01:06:58,237
Hi, want to go for a swim?

949
01:07:06,990 --> 01:07:08,514
Will Chaibat raid the court
and rescue the prisoner?

950
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:09,725
It's possible

951
01:07:09,993 --> 01:07:10,687
When could it be?

952
01:07:10,927 --> 01:07:13,191
He said he'd tell us then

953
01:07:16,499 --> 01:07:18,433
Come for a swim quick. Let's get together

954
01:07:20,737 --> 01:07:21,863
Come for a photo, all of you

955
01:07:22,105 --> 01:07:24,073
Stand over, one more

956
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:26,274
Stand still

957
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:45,293
We can see the photos

958
01:07:49,365 --> 01:07:51,356
We're now in the dark
and have lost contact with HK

959
01:07:51,634 --> 01:07:53,534
What on earth are we doing here?

960
01:07:56,639 --> 01:07:57,867
Look

961
01:07:58,241 --> 01:07:59,071
What?

962
01:07:59,309 --> 01:08:00,970
I'm thinking of the same question

963
01:08:04,147 --> 01:08:06,581
- Look how cute she is
- Really fantastic

964
01:08:07,216 --> 01:08:11,312
Let's go over to have a look

965
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:17,251
What's happening?

966
01:08:20,296 --> 01:08:21,422
May, what's wrong?

967
01:08:21,664 --> 01:08:22,961
Nothing

968
01:08:25,735 --> 01:08:27,066
Want a drink?

969
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:36,472
What are you doing?

970
01:08:36,746 --> 01:08:37,838
My girlfriend's coming

971
01:08:44,187 --> 01:08:45,484
Where's she now?

972
01:08:46,189 --> 01:08:47,315
Coming over

973
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:49,649
Massage me

974
01:09:16,119 --> 01:09:19,680
Chia-Chu, Chen Chia-Chu

975
01:09:20,056 --> 01:09:22,957
Chen Chia-Chu...

976
01:09:23,726 --> 01:09:25,318
Miss, what are you doing?

977
01:09:27,296 --> 01:09:29,025
I'm clearing up the photos

978
01:09:33,503 --> 01:09:34,561
Fu-Sheng

979
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:36,138
Are you okay?

980
01:09:36,372 --> 01:09:37,339
A headache

981
01:09:39,075 --> 01:09:41,009
Your brother must be highly strung

982
01:09:43,212 --> 01:09:44,804
I'll take him to relax...

983
01:09:45,248 --> 01:09:46,840
after we finish

984
01:09:47,483 --> 01:09:48,575
Okay

985
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:50,148
Okay

986
01:09:51,254 --> 01:09:52,881
I fell much better now

987
01:09:54,357 --> 01:09:55,551
Have you ordered anything?

988
01:09:55,825 --> 01:09:56,519
I don't know how to order it

989
01:09:56,759 --> 01:09:58,556
I don't speak English

990
01:09:58,928 --> 01:10:00,555
What do you want? Let me help you

991
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:01,761
I want Paris water

992
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:03,055
What?

993
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:04,832
What about you?

994
01:10:05,068 --> 01:10:06,262
Me, too

995
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:09,834
I'll teach you later

996
01:10:16,179 --> 01:10:19,512
Hua, let me show you how to order. Follow me

997
01:10:24,787 --> 01:10:26,755
Just tell the waiter...

998
01:10:27,023 --> 01:10:28,888
two glasses of Perrier, OK?

999
01:10:36,432 --> 01:10:39,401
Hua, don't worry, go now

1000
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:50,910
Chen Chia-Chu

1001
01:10:53,716 --> 01:10:55,616
Chen Chia-Chu

1002
01:10:59,388 --> 01:11:00,878
You call me, miss?

1003
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:09,730
May, listen to my explanation

1004
01:11:09,966 --> 01:11:12,628
Sorry, no need to explain

1005
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:15,002
Is the phone number of the Chemical car with you?

1006
01:11:18,241 --> 01:11:20,732
What's Fu-Sheng doing? Fooling around?

1007
01:11:21,644 --> 01:11:23,737
I left it in my room,
will give it to you in a minute

1008
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:24,969
Let me see what's happened

1009
01:11:25,248 --> 01:11:26,510
Be quick. I'll wait for you in the lobby

1010
01:11:27,483 --> 01:11:28,450
I really am on duty

1011
01:11:28,684 --> 01:11:30,743
I'd be finished if my identity was exposed

1012
01:11:32,088 --> 01:11:34,352
I'd have been swimming had I been here on holiday

1013
01:11:34,624 --> 01:11:36,592
Thank you

1014
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:39,184
In a word, I mustn't talk to you too long

1015
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:40,520
I'll call you...

1016
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:42,321
in your room

1017
01:11:42,832 --> 01:11:43,924
You're a nuisance!

1018
01:11:43,933 --> 01:11:44,695
What are you doing?

1019
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:45,667
Brother said 'no'

1020
01:11:45,935 --> 01:11:46,924
That slut tried to seduce me

1021
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:49,161
- I already said no. Go now
- Don't touch me!

1022
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:50,302
Go now

1023
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:51,837
Get out!

1024
01:11:53,042 --> 01:11:53,770
I'm talking to my boyfriend.

1025
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:55,807
What has that to do with you?

1026
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:57,279
Not bad

1027
01:11:57,513 --> 01:11:58,946
Right, but my sister doesn't like you

1028
01:11:59,182 --> 01:12:00,114
How much?

1029
01:12:00,449 --> 01:12:01,381
Not too expensive, I guess

1030
01:12:01,651 --> 01:12:03,482
Who's your boyfriend?

1031
01:12:08,391 --> 01:12:11,053
Go quick. Get a better one

1032
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:13,158
Not bad, don't waste it

1033
01:12:15,198 --> 01:12:16,825
What the hell are you going to do?

1034
01:12:17,066 --> 01:12:19,830
Miss, I'll take you if he doesn't

1035
01:12:20,236 --> 01:12:21,533
How much?

1036
01:12:22,371 --> 01:12:23,736
How much is your bloody mom?

1037
01:12:24,373 --> 01:12:26,034
Drink water!

1038
01:12:26,742 --> 01:12:28,141
What the hell are you doing? May

1039
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:30,835
Go, go

1040
01:12:34,584 --> 01:12:36,051
Are you OK?

1041
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:38,546
Yes

1042
01:12:38,821 --> 01:12:39,981
Let's go

1043
01:12:56,405 --> 01:12:57,394
Give me the key

1044
01:12:57,673 --> 01:12:58,503
What for?

1045
01:12:58,507 --> 01:12:59,997
I left the key at the swimming pool. Get it for me

1046
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:06,571
Come back quickly. Don't move around

1047
01:13:09,452 --> 01:13:10,783
Miss, what are you doing?

1048
01:13:11,587 --> 01:13:12,781
I feel like crying!

1049
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:14,920
Miss, you two mustn't tout here

1050
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:16,122
Tout your bloody hell!

1051
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:17,416
We live here!

1052
01:13:17,693 --> 01:13:19,388
What can I do for you?

1053
01:13:20,263 --> 01:13:22,629
Kill that bloody couple
who pushed me down the pool!

1054
01:13:24,734 --> 01:13:26,565
What did he say?

1055
01:13:26,802 --> 01:13:28,565
He said we're so beautiful

1056
01:13:29,705 --> 01:13:30,535
She's a whore

1057
01:13:38,814 --> 01:13:39,803
May, listen to my explanation

1058
01:13:40,816 --> 01:13:42,306
I can't tell you now

1059
01:13:42,718 --> 01:13:43,707
It's OK

1060
01:13:49,992 --> 01:13:50,788
May

1061
01:13:50,793 --> 01:13:51,487
Let go!

1062
01:13:51,494 --> 01:13:52,483
I know you've been humiliated

1063
01:13:52,762 --> 01:13:53,751
You know I have?

1064
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:54,792
Now every guest in the hotel...

1065
01:13:55,064 --> 01:13:55,792
takes me for a whore

1066
01:13:55,798 --> 01:13:56,765
What am I to do now?

1067
01:14:01,304 --> 01:14:05,468
You should know what I'm doing

1068
01:14:06,575 --> 01:14:07,507
Smile

1069
01:14:07,777 --> 01:14:08,937
Call Uncle Piao when you return to HK...

1070
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:12,170
Go to hell, creep!

1071
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:15,815
- May
- Let go. I don't care for your business

1072
01:14:16,085 --> 01:14:18,076
I'd rather go with that gentlemen behind

1073
01:14:18,321 --> 01:14:19,185
Look in a mirror,

1074
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:21,150
you're so ugly

1075
01:14:28,331 --> 01:14:31,494
A good-looking whore must have something wrong

1076
01:14:31,834 --> 01:14:33,096
Go now

1077
01:14:33,769 --> 01:14:34,758
What's wrong?

1078
01:14:35,271 --> 01:14:36,363
Nothing, I'll tell you later

1079
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:37,799
Let's go. Hurry up

1080
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:42,268
What is it?

1081
01:14:42,511 --> 01:14:43,876
The same thing again

1082
01:14:44,347 --> 01:14:47,282
Finish business first. Can you drive a truck

1083
01:14:47,883 --> 01:14:49,009
Yes

1084
01:14:50,019 --> 01:14:51,008
Good

1085
01:14:51,287 --> 01:14:52,879
Why don't you call from your room?

1086
01:14:53,622 --> 01:14:54,850
A public telephone is safer

1087
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:57,952
I told you to get the key

1088
01:14:58,327 --> 01:15:01,023
I forgot, I'll go get it now

1089
01:15:01,297 --> 01:15:03,060
See you in the room

1090
01:15:09,038 --> 01:15:10,164
What's going on?

1091
01:15:10,539 --> 01:15:12,063
I'm not really sure

1092
01:15:12,475 --> 01:15:14,909
Do you remember that guy? He's my boyfriend

1093
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:16,166
Really?

1094
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:19,037
He's a detective and he's on duty

1095
01:15:19,315 --> 01:15:20,339
But I don't know

1096
01:15:20,583 --> 01:15:21,641
He didn't tell you?

1097
01:15:21,884 --> 01:15:23,715
He couldn't, it's too dangerous

1098
01:15:25,388 --> 01:15:26,753
I think just now

1099
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:28,820
I've done something clever

1100
01:15:29,058 --> 01:15:30,355
Like what?

1101
01:15:30,593 --> 01:15:31,992
Never mind. It's just a surprise

1102
01:15:34,830 --> 01:15:35,592
Have some good rest

1103
01:15:35,865 --> 01:15:37,730
OK. Bye, May. I'll see you tomorrow

1104
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,365
OK. Don't be late

1105
01:15:39,602 --> 01:15:40,660
OK

1106
01:15:48,911 --> 01:15:50,435
Hua, where's Panther?

1107
01:15:50,713 --> 01:15:51,839
It's for Panther

1108
01:15:59,188 --> 01:16:02,214
Panther, take it easy on anything you hear

1109
01:16:02,625 --> 01:16:03,887
Our 2 assistants are:

1110
01:16:04,126 --> 01:16:06,094
Chen Chia-Chu, a Royal HK policeman

1111
01:16:06,629 --> 01:16:08,221
And his girlfriend, now in my hands

1112
01:16:08,464 --> 01:16:09,931
Tell us what to do?

1113
01:16:10,199 --> 01:16:11,860
Ok, make it one day later

1114
01:16:13,135 --> 01:16:16,104
Easy, act one day later

1115
01:16:16,372 --> 01:16:18,897
Keep the gun, give it to me

1116
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:38,493
Case No. 23-701-92 Cheng Wen Shi

1117
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:40,623
With regard to the charge,

1118
01:16:40,963 --> 01:16:44,831
I am satisfied that the evidence produced
by the prosecution

1119
01:16:45,101 --> 01:16:48,002
Has not been rebutted by the defense

1120
01:16:48,337 --> 01:16:52,967
The accused does not cast any reasonable
doubt on the prosecutions case

1121
01:16:53,476 --> 01:16:55,341
Under the circumstances

1122
01:16:56,078 --> 01:17:04,110
I find the accused guilty as charged
and convict her on the charge

1123
01:17:04,353 --> 01:17:06,321
And sentence her to death

1124
01:17:10,793 --> 01:17:12,283
Arise!

1125
01:17:44,059 --> 01:17:44,889
Chen Chia-Chu

1126
01:17:45,161 --> 01:17:46,128
Over

1127
01:17:46,362 --> 01:17:47,556
They're now moving your direction

1128
01:17:48,164 --> 01:17:50,860
Watch out to ensure the safety of your girlfriend

1129
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:52,558
Roger

1130
01:18:02,545 --> 01:18:05,070
Keep away. The car has no brakes!

1131
01:18:20,062 --> 01:18:21,222
The car has no brakes!

1132
01:18:27,336 --> 01:18:28,860
Retreat. Retreat, all of you!

1133
01:18:42,184 --> 01:18:44,744
That's no way to drive!

1134
01:18:49,525 --> 01:18:51,686
There's poison-gas in the car. Go now!

1135
01:18:51,927 --> 01:18:53,019
- What did he say?      - I don't know

1136
01:18:53,262 --> 01:18:54,194
Let me go!

1137
01:19:00,869 --> 01:19:03,235
Those chemicals are poisonous, they're lethal

1138
01:19:03,472 --> 01:19:04,200
Go quickly!

1139
01:19:06,809 --> 01:19:08,868
Evacuate the crowd quickly!

1140
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:22,155
Go quickly!

1141
01:19:26,328 --> 01:19:27,488
Let's go

1142
01:19:28,063 --> 01:19:29,087
What are you doing?

1143
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:31,456
Go now

1144
01:19:43,312 --> 01:19:44,745
Get in quickly!

1145
01:19:45,247 --> 01:19:46,271
I won't free any hostages without seeing May

1146
01:19:46,515 --> 01:19:47,504
Get in first

1147
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:48,909
Sorry

1148
01:19:49,151 --> 01:19:52,518
- Chia-Chu, help me!
- Let go of my wife quick!

1149
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:54,153
Chia-Chu

1150
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:55,980
Let May go, or I'll kill her with one shot

1151
01:19:56,258 --> 01:19:59,921
Chia-Chu, Chia-Chu

1152
01:20:01,497 --> 01:20:03,021
I'm damn scared!

1153
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,365
Let her go or we won't get free

1154
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:08,500
Chia-Chu

1155
01:20:12,675 --> 01:20:13,607
May

1156
01:20:13,842 --> 01:20:15,434
Get in, quick!

1157
01:20:16,111 --> 01:20:17,669
- May, are you OK?
- Brother, the police!

1158
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:28,312
Run quick!

1159
01:20:28,957 --> 01:20:30,185
Call a taxi for me

1160
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:43,896
Stop. Give me back the car!

1161
01:21:37,192 --> 01:21:39,752
Get out quick!

1162
01:21:41,029 --> 01:21:42,428
panther, bump him dead!

1163
01:21:47,469 --> 01:21:48,458
Hua, come down

1164
01:21:50,272 --> 01:21:51,432
Over there

1165
01:21:56,645 --> 01:21:58,306
A man on the top of the car!

1166
01:21:59,481 --> 01:22:01,745
Up above, he's crawling over

1167
01:22:02,718 --> 01:22:03,742
Up above

1168
01:22:32,681 --> 01:22:33,978
Are you all right?

1169
01:22:36,919 --> 01:22:38,011
Come

1170
01:22:58,273 --> 01:22:59,672
After him, after him quick!

1171
01:23:14,690 --> 01:23:17,523
Keep away, keep away!

1172
01:23:21,296 --> 01:23:22,627
This way. Run!

1173
01:23:30,372 --> 01:23:31,634
This way

1174
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:56,922
Let's go up over there

1175
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,930
Keep away, all of you! Open their handcuffs quick!

1176
01:24:02,571 --> 01:24:03,265
How is it?

1177
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:04,403
Give me the gun

1178
01:24:04,773 --> 01:24:06,035
Brother is coming soon! Hurry up!

1179
01:24:23,625 --> 01:24:26,093
They're over there

1180
01:24:26,461 --> 01:24:27,519
Over there

1181
01:24:40,142 --> 01:24:41,609
Wait over there. Brother's coming

1182
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:46,805
The two are over there

1183
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:48,071
Quick, fly over, fly over!

1184
01:24:48,817 --> 01:24:49,647
What are you doing?

1185
01:24:50,586 --> 01:24:51,746
I've dropped my gun

1186
01:24:51,987 --> 01:24:53,284
Make him believe that you still have it

1187
01:24:53,722 --> 01:24:54,882
Fake it?

1188
01:24:59,461 --> 01:25:00,587
They're not armed

1189
01:25:03,665 --> 01:25:04,461
Let's go

1190
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:12,573
Stay where you are!

1191
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:15,406
Keep away, or I'll shoot

1192
01:25:19,247 --> 01:25:20,145
Get him!

1193
01:25:20,415 --> 01:25:21,313
You're still alive?

1194
01:25:21,316 --> 01:25:22,510
What a coincidence

1195
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:26,148
Come down, help me!

1196
01:25:26,421 --> 01:25:27,683
OK

1197
01:25:31,259 --> 01:25:32,317
Come up

1198
01:25:59,287 --> 01:26:00,049
Are you okay?

1199
01:26:00,055 --> 01:26:01,647
Leave me alone. Follow them!

1200
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:05,619
Go, go

1201
01:26:13,301 --> 01:26:15,064
Knock him dead!

1202
01:27:11,026 --> 01:27:12,459
Over there

1203
01:27:32,748 --> 01:27:35,808
Fly over the train and land!

1204
01:27:36,084 --> 01:27:37,381
Okay

1205
01:28:18,426 --> 01:28:19,688
Help him!

1206
01:28:21,096 --> 01:28:22,996
Come down quick to help me!

1207
01:28:23,665 --> 01:28:24,927
Lower to save big brother!

1208
01:28:44,686 --> 01:28:46,381
Kuang, come down quick!

1209
01:28:51,393 --> 01:28:52,189
Big brother, are you all right?

1210
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:54,189
Yes. Bump him off!

1211
01:29:47,015 --> 01:29:48,039
Sit still

1212
01:29:48,683 --> 01:29:50,173
Take off!

1213
01:30:07,068 --> 01:30:07,796
Are you all right?

1214
01:30:08,069 --> 01:30:08,728
Come on!

1215
01:31:35,357 --> 01:31:38,292
Help, help!

1216
01:31:38,693 --> 01:31:40,820
Help me!

1217
01:31:57,345 --> 01:31:59,210
Go in

1218
01:32:24,372 --> 01:32:26,033
Come up!

1219
01:32:30,378 --> 01:32:34,576
338 6776, Code 1270WKU

1220
01:32:36,418 --> 01:32:38,352
the number can draw the money

1221
01:32:39,621 --> 01:32:41,282
Anybody can draw the money

1222
01:32:41,890 --> 01:32:42,879
I wanted to,

1223
01:32:43,124 --> 01:32:44,751
but it belongs to the HK Government

1224
01:32:45,026 --> 01:32:48,257
No, it belongs to the Chinese people

1225
01:32:48,963 --> 01:32:50,897
Let the HK Government keep it in custody for us

1226
01:32:51,132 --> 01:32:52,565
After 1997, we're also Chinese

1227
01:32:52,801 --> 01:32:54,200
And it will be yours too

1228
01:32:55,203 --> 01:32:56,465
No
