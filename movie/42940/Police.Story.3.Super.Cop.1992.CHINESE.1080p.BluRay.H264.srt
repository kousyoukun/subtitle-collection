1
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,816
The pushers have improved...

2
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,443
on means of drug smuggling

3
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:13,072
Drugs are hidden in condoms

4
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:16,909
Stomachs, rectums or even corpses

5
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,079
lncluding babies' bodies

6
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,664
Last year alone. . .

7
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,958
there were 1 50 cases of deaths

8
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,878
Caused by drug poisoning due. . .

9
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,713
to puncture in condoms

10
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:32,091
However,

11
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:33,467
they were in the minority

12
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:37,221
Most traffickers succeeded in passing the Customs

13
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:38,514
To fight drug activities has been one

14
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:39,807
Of the most important tasks. . .

15
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,100
of HK Police

16
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:43,018
This info is already known to us

17
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,354
Will you please get to the point?

18
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,941
OK, most of the drugs circulating

19
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,819
Come from drug king Chaibat

20
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,445
Capturing him. . .

21
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:57,116
will at least halve the circulation

22
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,993
ln what aspect can the Royal HK police help you?

23
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,287
Yes, what we need is a super cop

24
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:05,749
well, let me think about it.
l'll let you know tomorrow

25
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,633
Fix it for me, tell me tomorrow

26
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,677
Yes, sir

27
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,889
Superiors don't do things.

28
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,432
They give orders

29
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:23,767
Right

30
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,227
Fix it for me

31
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,314
l know already

32
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,609
Bring back Chia-chu right away

33
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:33,944
Yes, sir

34
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,488
Thank you

35
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:37,865
Yes, sir

36
00:02:58,761 --> 00:02:59,803
Morning, inspector Chen

37
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:00,721
Morning

38
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,897
Chia-chu, they're having a meeting

39
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,942
We mustn't let Chia-chu take up the mission

40
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,903
why not? lsn't he responsible?

41
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:17,654
Yes, he is

42
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:18,906
Doesn't he obey his superiors?

43
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,491
Yes, except for the nastiest superior

44
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,243
You always claimed l didn't promote him

45
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:25,162
Now he's got a chance and you won't let him do it

46
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,622
Chance?

47
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,082
lt's no fun infiltrating the Camp?

48
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,375
Are you afraid he can't make it?

49
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,878
No one can if he doesn't

50
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,880
lt's a waste putting him. . .

51
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,215
on patrol

52
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,133
Now lnterpol needs a super cop

53
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,093
He's a super cop,

54
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:41,470
but you won't let him do it

55
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:45,182
l know, but it's a most dangerous mission

56
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,892
He's followed me for so many yeas.

57
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,102
l can't let him take the risk!

58
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,812
Ok. we'll go...

59
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,314
and say 'no' to lnterpol

60
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,565
None at the Royal HK Police. . .

61
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,192
can do it

62
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:56,860
Send for James Bond

63
00:03:58,529 --> 00:03:59,696
Good!

64
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:09,998
lnspector Chen

65
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,468
Uncle Piao

66
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,428
Chia-chu, come in

67
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,432
l want to see you

68
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,518
Sit down

69
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:30,936
What is it so urgent?

70
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:33,605
A position suits you most

71
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:38,402
The lnspector of Shataukok Police Hq. Sign it here

72
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,071
Uncle Piao, let me do it

73
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,572
l'm letting you do it

74
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,701
The air is fresh at Shataukok Police Hq

75
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,452
And you don't have to patrol

76
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,329
l mean the lnterpol mission

77
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,622
Have you heard of it?

78
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,249
Let me do it

79
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,001
lt's the most dangerous mission

80
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,504
When one is numbed. . .

81
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:58,714
by everyday routine

82
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,882
Sitting in office could be more dangerous

83
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:04,845
Do you have to consult May?

84
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,055
Not necessary. l've made the decision

85
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,018
Go and be prepared

86
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,228
Yes, sir

87
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,064
Chia-chu

88
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,065
Yes?

89
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,692
The Commissioner must be happy to know it

90
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,944
Are you unhappy?

91
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,988
l'd be happier if the Commissioner did it

92
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,125
Aren't we very mean?

93
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,795
A little bit, but you're the more so

94
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,172
why?

95
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,132
Because you're my superior

96
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,261
why have you to enter the camp so abruptly?

97
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,306
What training is that? why didn't you call me?

98
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:53,894
A Special Training Camp.
l get a promotion after that

99
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,103
Aren't you happy for me?

100
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,482
Yes, since it's not a dangerous mission

101
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:02,569
lt's safer in the camp involving no risk

102
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,864
My life insurance policy

103
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,242
My bank passbook

104
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,036
why are you giving them to me?

105
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,664
You're the beneficiary. Come

106
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,466
what are you doing?

107
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,970
The key to the safe with foreign currency deposits

108
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,305
Why are you giving me all these?

109
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,890
Didn't you say you'd return very soon?

110
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,142
l'm afraid l may be late

111
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,644
Don't forget to pay the insurance premium for me

112
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,854
And renew the bank deposit when it matures

113
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,525
what are you doing?

114
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:42,859
One month!

115
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,194
You're late

116
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,029
They won't kill me for being late

117
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,171
Remember not to woo boys!

118
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,840
You'd better guard yourself against it!

119
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,216
May

120
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,385
- Uncle Piao - Uncle Piao

121
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:13,056
l'll keep an eye on him for this month

122
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:14,641
Go now, bye-bye

123
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:15,976
Bye-bye

124
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,394
Bye-bye, Uncle Piao

125
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,110
Your certificate and air ticket for Canton

126
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:26,486
Yes, sir

127
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,488
Be on the alert

128
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:29,781
Don't worry,

129
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,367
the Chinese Public Security will help fully

130
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,743
That makes me worry the more

131
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,496
Uncle Piao, say something better, will you

132
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,915
Good luck!

133
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,001
ln fact, the Royal HK police

134
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:45,547
are flying Chia-chu like a kite for this mission

135
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,675
lt may break when the wind is gusty,
no one know where will it be

136
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,178
Don't make such daring parable

137
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,387
Don't worry.

138
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,431
l'll drift back if the string breaks

139
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,600
Chia-chu is up to the scratch, as l said

140
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,727
Good luck!

141
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,020
Thank you, sir

142
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,813
Uncle Piao, l'm leaving

143
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,069
Good luck!

144
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,654
- Yes, sir
- Chia-chu

145
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,072
Stop nagging

146
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,241
Call this number in case of emergency

147
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,411
Remember this number. Tear it in a minute

148
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,331
l've remembered it

149
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:20,874
- l'm leaving
- l'll tear it for you

150
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,876
l'm leaving

151
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,545
Thank you

152
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,798
l'm making a call. Don't disturb me

153
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,135
You're giving him my hone number!

154
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,763
OK, for everybody!

155
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,217
Please

156
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,608
Sit down

157
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,791
Are you the super cop from Hong Kong?

158
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,211
According to information from HK

159
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,924
Chen Chia-chu (super cop)

160
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,347
Super cops in HK...

161
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,975
are cheap and plentiful

162
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:03,393
Like commodities in supermarkets

163
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,104
He's a modest young man

164
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,565
we're of one family.

165
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,358
we'll help you

166
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,568
Thank you

167
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,820
This is a dangerous mission

168
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:17,032
We must arrange to familiarize yourself

169
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,618
with conditions in China

170
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:20,910
What conditions?

171
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,205
Director of lnterpol Yang will arrange it for you

172
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,593
This is our Director Yang

173
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,762
How do you do, Miss Yang?

174
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,847
Lear from her

175
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,515
Yes

176
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:43,850
Have a good chat

177
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,352
Yes, Commissar

178
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:56,363
So Director Yang is a beautiful lady

179
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,948
You may speak to me in Chinese

180
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:03,495
That's much better

181
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:05,747
Let's start

182
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:06,956
Okay

183
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,542
As of this minute, you're Lin Fu-sheng,

184
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:10,794
32

185
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,630
A merchandiser of Fu Shan State
5th Mechanical Factory

186
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:14,839
Understand?

187
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:15,965
Yes

188
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,176
Your uniform is presentable

189
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,636
Can civilians wear it?

190
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,347

So many men? Are they all yours?

239
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,143
They're grandad's

240
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,144

To rescue him from the Labor Camp

252
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,049
We're now stalling for time

253
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,801
Only these few photos will do?

254
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,469

00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,218
This is breath control?

262
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,137
Didn't you learn it?

263
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:34,474
No, what an idiot standing to get beaten

264
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,897
Director Yang

265
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:43,024

Sure

277
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,883
Stop practicing!

278
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,594
All for the assembly!

279
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,317
Sit down!

No

288
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,345
Stop it if anything happens

289
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,056
No

290
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,315
lt's only for fun

291
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,031
Sorry

292
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,029

Thank you

295
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:39,951
Let's go on a little longer

296
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,037
How is it operated?

297
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,791
Simple. Grasping above with both hands,
feet over here

298
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,209
l push you

299
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:59,053
How is it stopped?

300
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:22,743
Next time call me the World Champion of Somersault

301
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,079
No more fun. Our mission begins

302
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,622
Do l look like having fun?

303
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,274
There are 3 trucks with 6 men

304
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,943
You remember the direction of the coal mine?

305
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,862
Yes, everything

306
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,656
My only forte is a good memory

307
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,367
ls that so? Remember the position
of the overhead tunnel

308
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,369
Don't worry. l attach more importance to this

309
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,580
Tell your men not to shoot wantonly

310
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,123
Part of the guards have no bullets

311
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,042
You two go down and be ready

312
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,754

313
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,714

317
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,409

Quick, quick!

323
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,191

00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,748
Nothing but coal

327
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,249
Coal?

328
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,254

Crazy, run!

342
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:18,479
what did Hsiung say just now?

343
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:19,772
He said he didn't know the direction

344
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:20,564
Don't you?

345
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,108
Yes, go upward

346
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,235
So high. How are we to go up?

347
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:25,528

00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,438
get to town through the main street

381
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,650
Bye-bye

382
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:54,236
Where are you going?

383
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:57,489
Hsiung paid me $2,000. . .

384
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,241
to bring you here only

385
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:00,451
The rest l don't care

386
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,911
You're OK in kung fu

387
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:04,371
Take me to town,

388
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,165
and l'll take you to HK for a big deal

389
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,793
Hong Kong's so far away. Forget it

390
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,837
Pay me $500 more and l'll take you to town

391
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:13,213
l haven't got so much

392
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:16,800
Once in HK, l can pay you up to $ 50,000

393
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:20,179
l don't blame you as we're strangers,
but do trust me

394
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:25,684
OK, pay me $50,000 once we're in HK

395
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,853
No problem, count on me

396
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:29,855
Hurry, it's going to rain

397
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:32,650
why are you following Hsiung?

398
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,485
l follow anybody that pays

399
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,112
Where's your home town?

400
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:39,573
Fu Shan

401
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:12,064
Don't you raise pigs in the country?

402
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:16,777
The pigs in our country eat vegetables

403
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,655
The pigs here eat feed, and they stink

404
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,462
Panther

405
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:42,678
A friend

406
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:49,351
Panther

407
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,478
Come out, everybody, panther's back

408
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:55,399
Panther, you're back?

409
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,608
Panther

410
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,569
Bring a towel quick!

411
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:01,780
You've thinned!

412
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:04,283
Panther, it's nice you're out.
You must've suffered

413
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:08,579
Never. lt was like holiday in the camp

414
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,831
You're big brother where you are

415
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,000
Yes, yes

416
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:19,214

417
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,759
Fishball

418
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:23,177
l know nothing

419
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,890
Sha Pi, what happened to our cargo?

420
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,516
Confiscated by Public Security

421
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:35,981
Panther, l didn't do it

422
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:39,359
Don't! panther, sorry

423
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,945
My fault, sorry

424
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:45,115
Panther, give me a break

425
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,909
Don't, brother!

426
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,619
Give me a break!

427
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:06,887

Arriving in a couple of days

431
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,524

Go and visit your folks while...

00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,739
we still have time

435
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:27,157
Okay

436
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,618
Sha Pi, Fishball, follow me

437
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,745

440
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,467
Fu-Sheng

441
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:48,762
Come up. Panther's calling you

442
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,138
What is it?

443
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,306
where is it?

444
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:52,641
Not yet there

445
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,602

446
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:00,232

447
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,944

448
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:07,531
Cross-road? Just move along

449
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:23,672
where is it?

450
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:25,799
Public Security from behind. Move quickly!

451
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,055

452
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,056

455
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,396
You don't know where you live?

456
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:42,357
l've been away 3 years. Much has changed

457
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:43,859
You must still have some impression

458
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:48,655
Sure, but there are now more buildings

459
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:58,832
Panther, come

460
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:10,719
Uncle Fu-Sheng

461
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:14,598
Granny missed me. Come home quick!

462
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,477
My nephew

463

Good. Let me take you to see your mammy

467
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,239
My auntie

468
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:32,950
This way

469
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,743
Not this way, that way

470
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:36,536
l know. Let me take it for you

471
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,081
Not necessary. Please follow me

472
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:41,083
Panther, this way

473
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,544

476
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,135
Fu-Sheng

477
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,390
Must be doing fine

478
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,225
Of course

479
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:02,729
See your mammy. She missed you

480
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,776
Madam, madam

481
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,111
why is she out of sight?

482
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:11,071
Fu-Sheng, take care of your friends

483
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,114
Your mammy must've fallen asleep

484
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,991
Panther, sit down, make yourself at home

485
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,784
Sit down

487
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,870
Fu-Sheng, where's the toilet?

488
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,790
Outside, turn

489
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,333
Just do it when there's no one around

490
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,585
People do it anywhere in the country

491
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:28,171
Fu-Sheng, who's that girl?

492
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,007
Girl? which one?

493
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,633
This

494
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,260
Which one?

495
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,220
That girl in the photo with you

496
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,223
Your wife?

497
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,308
She's...

498
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:43,895
Brother, you're back!

499
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,441
My sister

500
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:49,443
Your sister?

501
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:50,652
Yes

502
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,821
Brother, when did you come back?

503
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:58,118
Sister, it's been years. You're much taller

504
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:03,248
And more beautiful, and plumper

505
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:07,044
You're squeezing me so hard!

506
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:08,628
You siblings are getting on OK

what's your name, please?

511
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,216
My name's Hua

512
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,426
She's named Hua

513
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:17,304
Bring tea for Panther, quick

514
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,890
We've been fighting since childhood

515
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,683
Undress and you feel better

516
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:23,060
Fu-Sheng

517
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,353
Brat,

518
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:29,566
it's been a long time

519
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:33,487
You have such long moustache

520
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,780
Thanks, auntie

521
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,907

Plenty. He's Fu-Sheng, your sn

523
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,079
Yes. Mammy, l'm back

524
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:45,207
Fu-Sheng, l've been waiting for you for ages

525
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,459
Even a fortune...

526
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,879
is not enough for you

527
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,423
Have you brought any money?

528
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:56,551
Money! Only money fascinates you

529
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,262
Brother knows better. Sit down

530
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:02,099
Sit down

Got a watch?

534
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:13,985
No

535
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,779
Got any money then?

536
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,030
Neither

537
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,324
- No money and no watch
- Yes, yes

538
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:20,408
Money?

539
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:21,701

For me? what money is that?

00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:27,666
Hong Kong dollars

543
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,543
Hong Kong dollar is valuable

544
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:33,880
Hua, go and buy two chickens

545
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:36,383
Let me treat you to a chicken meal

546
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,176
Now security is bad. . .

547
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,388

Let me make the introduction

554
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,110
Okay, that won't be necessary

00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,703
Brat, rushing away without eating

558
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,538
l'm taking him to make money

559
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:11,084

Bye-bye, mammy

566
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:48,288
Here people love wild life as food

567
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,916
Even those any animals. . .

568
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,585

00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:11,817
Yes

759
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:15,321
lt pays to make use of waste material

760
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:20,493
what's your name?

761
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:21,827
My name is Hua

762
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,956
Take her down to try that bullet-proof vest

763
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:27,541
Okay, follow me

764
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:32,588
Good, Hua will follow me tomorrow

765
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:34,423
Let me break the record first

766
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:38,511
Panther,

767
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,513
what big deals require bullet-proof vests?

768
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:41,889
l'll tell you then

769
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,933
Come and see brother play video game

770
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:48,687
Big brother, Scar Chiang double-crossed Kun.

771
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,606
Drown him?

772
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:52,274
Do according to rules

773
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:57,947
Big brother,

774
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,657
solicitor Chen just called long distance

775
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,283
- Solicitor Chen? - Yes

776
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:12,169
Out of the way!

777
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:15,589
Dump him down!

778
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,600
He double-crossed big brother

779
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:28,394
He asked for it

780
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:32,314
Come up

781
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:37,736
Big brother, a call for you

782
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:57,631
Whether we can win this lawsuit is immaterial

783
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:01,177
But you must get back
the bank code from her

784
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:04,638
Not just try, you must

785
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:10,311
l know what to do if you do it well

786
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:53,312
General

787
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:59,068
welcome, Chaibat

788
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:23,050
Poor crop in the Golden Triangle;

789
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:24,843
too much rain

790
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:26,303
l'm afraid l have no stuff for you

791
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:27,513
where are they?

792
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,640
The 30% l got can't meet the demand

793
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:33,978
l don't care what you guys want. l want 3 tons

794
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:38,357
You heard it. The two of them got 50%

795
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:40,192
Give all the rest to me

796
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:43,362
Sorry, l've already taken the other half

797
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:45,072
The others have no share

798
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:48,158
Are you the one to dictate?

799
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,202
You think you're President Bush?

800
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:57,543
All l want to say now...

801
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:59,128
is no stuff this year

802
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,881
So you met...

803
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,217
to take away my cut

804
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:08,512
Business is business! Does my dough stink?

805
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:13,934
who dares to say that?

806
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:17,313
But who didn't pay...

807
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:20,899
for the last batch?

808
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,776
l didn't

809
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:25,237
l have lots of money in a Swiss bank

810
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:27,323
But somebody tipped off...

811
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:28,699
the Malaysian police

812
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:30,326
They arrested my wife

813
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:31,994
So l owed you the money

814
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:35,664
Your wife got arrested by Malaysian police?

815
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:38,000
She might squeal

816
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:52,598
Don't use violence!

817
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:55,267
Chaibat, talk, don't use violence!

818
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:56,560
He's the informer!

819
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:58,812
You can say anything. What have you got?

820
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:01,231
What have l got?

821
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:06,695
General, good stuff!

822
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:14,828
What happened?

823
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:15,829
This is big brother's signal

824
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:16,997
Let me see

825
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:22,753
Stop, don't move!

826
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:24,755
Don't shoot

827
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:27,174
lt's all dynamite inside the clothes!

828
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:28,175
One shot,

829
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:29,968
and you'll all perish with me

830
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,136
Big brother

831
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:33,472
ls my sister okay?

832
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:35,974
Don't worry, she's safe with big brother

833
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:37,935
Fix those two. . .

834
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:39,895
if you hear the bang

835
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:41,939
Okay?

836
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:42,773
Yes

837
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:44,066
Okay

838
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:45,859
Drop the gun!

839
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:52,116
Don't ever try to rob me. . .

840
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:53,909
of my share

841
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,203
Double-cross me?

842
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:59,331
Chaibat, don't ever misunderstand

843
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,166
l'm in business

844
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:03,210
Talk over your personal grudge

845
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:06,338
Before speaking to me

846
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:08,006
Let's go out

847
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:10,342
General, general

848
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:13,387
lt's me. What now?

849
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,890
None of you must get out of this house!

850
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:19,768
Surround the house quickly!

851
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:24,940
l've endured enough,

852
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:26,817
you won't get out here alive

853
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:28,694
Shoot if you have the nerve

854
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:12,381
Fu-Sheng, finish him off!

855
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:23,725
Give it to me

856
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:32,693
Where's my sister?

857
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:36,905
Chaibat

858
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:52,879
Fire if you've the guts!

859
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:07,352
Hold me!

860
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:11,648
Let go!

861
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:22,409
watch this side for me!

862
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:23,952
what are you doing then?

863
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:28,707
You took off the bullet-proof vest, why?

864
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:33,086
lt's full of dynamite!

865
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:34,630
Dynamite? That creep!

866
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:35,547
l mustn't get hit

867
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:37,132
l mustn't get hit too

868
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:40,552
Run quickly!

869
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:42,095
Go in

870
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:46,058
l shouldn't have brought you here

871
01:00:49,103 --> 01:00:49,895
You really are clumsy!

872
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:50,979
You are clumsy yourself!

873
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:52,189
See if anything can be used

874
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:54,274
lt has no bullets

875
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:57,152
Catch!

876
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:00,614
Move, and l shoot!

877
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:01,573
what did he say?

878
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:03,200
No idea. l guess they daren't shoot

879
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:04,326
l count to 3...

880
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:04,868
and we feign to throw grenades

881
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:06,161
- 1 , 2, 3
- what did you say?

882
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:12,167
Feign to throw grenades!

883
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:14,294
Next time speak more clearly

884
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:54,376
Chaibat, come out!

885
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:02,884
What's it so serious, general?

886
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:06,138
You take the law into your own hands in my area

887
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:07,889
You're not giving me face

888
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:10,142
You aren't giving me any either

889
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:14,229
You didn't help me over this

890
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:18,108
Blaming me! What am l to say to the others?

891
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:21,153
You don't have to

892
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:24,448
As of now, l'll buy all the stuff here

893
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:27,325
l'll make good to you this loss

894
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:30,287
A compensation alone can't settle everything

895
01:02:31,789 --> 01:02:33,707
l can't help if you don't agree

896
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:36,835
But l know you're smart

897
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:39,296
l wouldn't have come unprepared

898
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:43,925
Look around if your eyes are still good

899
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:56,772
well, l won't push you too hard

900
01:02:57,023 --> 01:03:00,066
But l can't decide on you cornering. . .

901
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:01,568
the stuff here

902
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:04,237
Do you have to see Mr. Chin Sha?

903
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:07,365
lf you lead, l don't mind going with you

904
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:09,910
Prepare the helicopter

905
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:11,328
Yes

906
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:16,917
ls it OK?

907
01:03:18,377 --> 01:03:19,461
Chaibat

908
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:24,049
You gave my sister a dynamite-laced vest?

909
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,717
what if she really got hit?

910
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:27,302
Stay where you are!

911
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:32,432
None dare you to talk to me in this tone!

912
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:37,562
Hua

913
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:39,314
You scum!

914
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:42,275
Hua

915
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:51,284
You'd have died
if it weren't for a bullet-proof vest

916
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:53,662
l won't treat my brothers this way

917
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:56,706
You two kids really are okay

918
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:02,003
Chaibat, you're great. Please

919
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:08,927
Take them to Malaysia and wait for me

920
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:10,929
Have a good time

921
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:21,982
Scum, l'll get him sooner of later!

922
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:39,499
Miss Cheng, Mr. Chaibat sends you his regards

923
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:41,126
Did you come here to say this only?

924
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:44,880
Whatever the verdict, we can still appeal

925
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:46,923
l know the law here well

926
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:50,343
He has good reason to set your mind at ease

927
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:51,970
No point in saying only

928
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:54,931
He wants me to get...

929
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:57,559
the code to your Swiss bank account

930
01:04:57,810 --> 01:04:59,895
l'll tell him when l see him

931
01:05:19,665 --> 01:05:22,375
Get a clearer idea of what's around here

932
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:28,173
Let me take a photo for you, here

933
01:05:29,842 --> 01:05:31,718
Come on, smile

934
01:05:34,221 --> 01:05:35,513
Go over there for a look

935
01:05:44,982 --> 01:05:47,400
Fu-Sheng, this is most important

936
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:02,457
Please come over this way

937
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:09,172
Welcome, ladies & gentlemen, to Merdeka Square

938
01:06:14,845 --> 01:06:16,513
Get acquainted with surroundings
of this street

939
01:06:21,852 --> 01:06:23,645
Come, let's go over there

940
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:32,612
The serious criminals take this route to the Court

941
01:06:33,364 --> 01:06:34,406
Take a closer look

942
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:37,033
Panther, would you tell us why?

943
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:41,162
we'll tell you then

944
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:43,331
Come, let's take a look at the junction

945
01:06:57,221 --> 01:06:58,263
Hi, want to go for a swim?

946
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:08,523
will Chaibat raid the court
and rescue the prisoner?

947
01:07:08,774 --> 01:07:09,733
lt's possible

948
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:10,692
when could it be?

949
01:07:10,943 --> 01:07:13,194
He said he'd tell us then

950
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:18,450
Come for a swim quick. Let's get together

951
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:21,870
Come for a photo, all of you

952
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:24,080
Stand over, one more

953
01:07:24,331 --> 01:07:26,291
Stand still

954
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:45,310
we can see the photos

955
01:07:49,356 --> 01:07:51,357
we're now in the dark
and have lost contact with HK

956
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:53,526
What on earth are we doing here?

957
01:07:56,655 --> 01:07:57,864
Look

958
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,074
What?

959
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:00,992
l'm thinking of the same question

960
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:06,581
- Look how cute she is
- Really fantastic

961
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:11,336
Let's go over to have a look

962
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:17,258
What's happening?

963
01:08:20,304 --> 01:08:21,429
May, what's wrong?

964
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:22,972
Nothing

965
01:08:25,726 --> 01:08:27,060

966
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:36,486

967
01:08:36,737 --> 01:08:37,862
My girlfriend's coming

968
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:45,495
where's she now?

969
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:47,330
Coming over

970
01:08:48,582 --> 01:08:49,666
Massage me

971
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:19,696

01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:22,949
Chen Chia-Chu...

973
01:09:23,742 --> 01:09:25,326
Miss, what are you doing?

974
01:09:27,288 --> 01:09:29,038
l'm clearing up the photos

975
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:34,586
Fu-Sheng

976
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:36,129
Are you okay?

977
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:37,338
A headache

978
01:09:39,091 --> 01:09:41,009
Your brother must be highly strung

979
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:44,804
l'll take him to relax. . .

980
01:09:45,264 --> 01:09:46,848
after we finish

981
01:09:47,474 --> 01:09:50,143
Okay

983
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:55,565
Have you ordered anything?

984
01:09:55,816 --> 01:09:56,524
l don't know how to order it

985
01:09:56,775 --> 01:09:58,568
l don't speak English

986
01:09:58,944 --> 01:10:00,570
What do you want? Let me help you

987
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:01,779
l want Paris water

988
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:03,072
What?

989
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:04,824

990
01:10:05,075 --> 01:10:06,284
Me, too

991
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:09,829

992
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:19,505
Hua, let me show you how to order. Follow me

993
01:10:24,803 --> 01:10:26,763
Just tell the waiter. . .

"two glasses of Perrier", OK?

995
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:39,400
Hua, don't worry, go now

996
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:55,625
Chen Chia-Chu

997
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:00,880
You call me, miss?

998
01:11:07,846 --> 01:11:09,722
May, listen to my explanation

999
01:11:09,974 --> 01:11:12,642
Sorry, no need to explain

1000
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:15,019
ls the phone number of the Chemical car with you?

1001
01:11:18,232 --> 01:11:20,733
What's Fu-Sheng doing? Fooling around?

1002
01:11:21,652 --> 01:11:23,736
l left it in my room,
will give it to you in a minute

1003
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:24,988
Let me see what's happened

l really am on duty

1006
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:30,743
l'd be finished if my identity was exposed

1007
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:34,372
l'd have been swimming had l been here on holiday

1008
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:36,582
Thank you

1009
01:11:37,668 --> 01:11:39,210
ln a word, l mustn't talk to you too long

1010
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:40,545
l'll call you...

1011
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:42,338
in your room

1012
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:43,923
You're a nuisance!

1013
01:11:43,924 --> 01:11:44,716
what are you doing?

1014
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:45,675
Brother said 'no'

1015
01:11:45,926 --> 01:11:46,926
That slut tried to seduce me

1016
01:11:47,177 --> 01:11:49,178
- l already said no. Go now
- Don't touch me!

1017
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:50,305
Go now

1018
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:51,848
Get out!

1019
01:11:53,058 --> 01:11:53,766
l'm talking to my boyfriend.

1020
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:55,810
what has that to do with you?

1021
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:57,270
Not bad

1022
01:11:57,521 --> 01:11:58,938
Right, but my sister doesn't like you

1023
01:11:59,189 --> 01:12:00,106
How much?

1024
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:01,399
Not too expensive, l guess

1025
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:03,484
who's your boyfriend?

1026
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:11,075
Go quick. Get a better one

1027
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:13,161
Not bad, don't waste it

1028
01:12:15,205 --> 01:12:16,831

1029
01:12:17,082 --> 01:12:19,834
Miss, l'll take you if he doesn't

1030
01:12:20,252 --> 01:12:21,544
How much?

1031
01:12:22,379 --> 01:12:23,755
How much is your bloody mom?

1032
01:12:24,381 --> 01:12:26,049
Drink water!

1033
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:28,134
what the hell are you doing? May

1034
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:30,845
Go, go

1035
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,059
Are you OK?

1036
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:38,561
Yes

1037
01:12:38,812 --> 01:12:39,979
Let's go

1038
01:12:56,413 --> 01:12:57,413
Give me the key

1039
01:12:57,664 --> 01:12:58,498

l left the key at the swimming pool. Get it for me

1041
01:13:04,588 --> 01:13:06,589
Come back quickly. Don't move around

1042
01:13:09,468 --> 01:13:10,802
Miss, what are you doing?

1043
01:13:11,595 --> 01:13:12,804

1044
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:14,931
Miss, you two mustn't tout here

1045
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:16,140
Tout your bloody hell!

1046
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:17,433

1047
01:13:17,684 --> 01:13:19,394
what can l do for you?

1048
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:22,647
Kill that bloody couple
who pushed me down the pool!

1049
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:26,567
what did he say?

1050
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:28,569
He said we're so beautiful

1051
01:13:29,696 --> 01:13:30,530
She's a whore

1052
01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:39,831
May, listen to my explanation

1053
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:42,333

1054
01:13:42,709 --> 01:13:43,709
lt's OK

1055
01:13:50,008 --> 01:13:50,800
May

1056
01:13:50,801 --> 01:13:51,509
Let go!

1057
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:52,510
l know you've been humiliated

1058
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:53,761
You know l have?

1059
01:13:54,012 --> 01:13:54,804
Now every guest in the hotel...

1060
01:13:55,055 --> 01:13:55,805
takes me for a whore

1061
01:13:55,806 --> 01:13:56,764
What am l to do now?

1062
01:14:01,311 --> 01:14:05,481
You should know what l'm doing

1063
01:14:06,567 --> 01:14:07,525
Smile

1064
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:08,943
Call Uncle Piao when you return to HK...

1065
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:12,196
Go to hell, creep!

1066
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:15,825
- May
- Let go. l don't care for your business

1067
01:14:16,076 --> 01:14:18,077
l'd rather go with that gentlemen behind

1068
01:14:18,328 --> 01:14:19,203
Look in a mirror,

1069
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:21,164
you're so ugly

1070
01:14:28,338 --> 01:14:31,507
A good-looking whore must have something wrong

1071
01:14:31,842 --> 01:14:33,092
Go now

1072
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:34,760
What's wrong?

1073
01:14:35,262 --> 01:14:36,387
Nothing, l'll tell you later

1074
01:14:36,638 --> 01:14:37,805
Let's go. Hurry up

1075
01:14:41,226 --> 01:14:42,268
What is it?

1076
01:14:42,519 --> 01:14:43,895
The same thing again

1077
01:14:44,354 --> 01:14:47,273
Finish business first. Can you drive a truck

1078
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:49,025
Yes

1079
01:14:50,027 --> 01:14:51,027
Good

1080
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:52,904
why don't you call from your room?

1081
01:14:53,614 --> 01:14:54,864
A public telephone is safer

1082
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:57,950
l told you to get the key

1083
01:14:58,327 --> 01:15:01,037
l forgot, l'll go get it now

1084
01:15:01,288 --> 01:15:03,080
See you in the room

1085
01:15:09,046 --> 01:15:10,171
what's going on?

1086
01:15:10,547 --> 01:15:12,089
l'm not really sure

1087
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:14,926
Do you remember that guy? He's my boyfriend

1088
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:16,177
Really?

1089
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:19,055
He's a detective and he's on duty

1090
01:15:19,306 --> 01:15:20,348
But l don't know

1091
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:21,641
He didn't tell you?

1092
01:15:21,892 --> 01:15:23,726
He couldn't, it's too dangerous

1093
01:15:25,395 --> 01:15:26,771
l think just now

1094
01:15:27,022 --> 01:15:28,814
l've done something clever

1095
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:30,358
Like what?

1096
01:15:30,609 --> 01:15:31,984
Never mind. lt's just a surprise

1097
01:15:34,821 --> 01:15:35,613
Have some good rest

1098
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:37,740
OK. Bye, May. l'll see you tomorrow

1099
01:15:37,991 --> 01:15:39,367
OK. Don't be late

1100
01:15:39,618 --> 01:15:40,660
OK

1101
01:15:48,919 --> 01:15:50,461
Hua, where's Panther?

1102
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:51,837
lt's for Panther

1103
01:15:59,179 --> 01:16:02,223
Panther, take it easy on anything you hear

1104
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:03,891
Our 2 assistants are:

1105
01:16:04,142 --> 01:16:06,102
Chen Chia-Chu, a Royal HK policeman

1106
01:16:06,645 --> 01:16:08,229
And his girlfriend, now in my hands

1107
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:09,939
Tell us what to do?

1108
01:16:10,190 --> 01:16:11,857
Ok, make it one day later

1109
01:16:13,151 --> 01:16:16,112
Easy, act one day later

1110
01:16:16,363 --> 01:16:18,906
Keep the gun, give it to me

1111
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:38,509
Case No. 23-701 -92 Cheng Wen Shi

1112
01:16:38,927 --> 01:16:40,636
with regard to the charge,

1113
01:16:40,971 --> 01:16:44,849
l am satisfied that the evidence produced
by the prosecution

1114
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:48,019
Has not been rebutted by the defense

1115
01:16:48,353 --> 01:16:52,982
The accused does not cast any reasonable
doubt on the prosecutions case

1116
01:16:53,483 --> 01:16:55,359
Under the circumstances

1117
01:16:56,069 --> 01:17:04,118
l find the accused guilty as charged
and convict her on the charge

1118
01:17:04,369 --> 01:17:06,329
And sentence her to death

1119
01:17:10,792 --> 01:17:12,293
Arise!

1120
01:17:44,076 --> 01:17:44,909
Chen Chia-Chu

1121
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:46,118

1122
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:47,578
They're now moving your direction

1124
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:52,583
Roger

1125
01:18:02,552 --> 01:18:05,096
Keep away. The car has no brakes!

1126
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:21,237
The car has no brakes!

1127
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:28,869
Retreat. Retreat, all of you!

1128
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:44,760
