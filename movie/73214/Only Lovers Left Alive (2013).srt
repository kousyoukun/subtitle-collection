1
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,074

2
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:17,158
- Ian
- Adam, man, how are you?

3
00:04:17,556 --> 00:04:21,656
- Hey. Is this the Supra?
- Yeah. It's a beautiful one, man

4
00:04:21,766 --> 00:04:27,766
I really hope you're gonna like it 'cause these Supras
are getting harder and harder to find you know what I mean?

5
00:04:28,249 --> 00:04:32,949
You get one and pick up and it's got something and then the neck is messed up or something

6
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:39,008
Oh shit!
Adam, do you want me to take off my shoes, man?
I think I got stucked with some mudders.

7
00:04:39,544 --> 00:04:42,244
- I really wouldn't bother
- Okay

8
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:52,004
- The Supra.
- 1959, man.

9
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:03,634
- Really nice, Ian. Thank you.
- Cool.

10
00:05:03,692 --> 00:05:09,192
All the electronics, everything, are original.
Of course, I plugged them in, and they're all work.

11
00:05:09,354 --> 00:05:13,654
Just what the doctor ordered.
As they say.

12
00:05:19,792 --> 00:05:23,242
I should call it William Lawes.
It's a male?

13
00:05:24,837 --> 00:05:26,837
This one is, yeah.

14
00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:29,869
Who is William Lawes?
He was just a 17th century english guy.

15
00:05:34,398 --> 00:05:36,398
Wrote some great funeral music.

16
00:05:38,335 --> 00:05:44,335
And during the english civil war
he was casually shot dead by a parlamentarian.

17
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,080
That sucks.

18
00:05:53,974 --> 00:05:56,074
Adam, check this one out, man.

19
00:05:59,115 --> 00:06:03,415
- This one...
- It's a very strange Hagstrom, from 1960.

20
00:06:04,186 --> 00:06:06,186
- Sweddish.
- Yeah.

21
00:06:06,444 --> 00:06:08,444
Look at this thing.

22
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:17,420
Look at the back
Mother of toilet's seat.

23
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:22,055
Seriously, man.

24
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:29,599
And this one...
Check this out.

25
00:06:31,096 --> 00:06:36,496
It's Silverton, in the very early 60's.
With an amp fit into the case.

26
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,550
- Fantastic.
- Right?

27
00:06:39,087 --> 00:06:41,787
- Yeah
- And...

28
00:06:45,157 --> 00:06:48,857
Oh, that's a lovely Gretsch 'Chet Atkins'.

29
00:06:53,805 --> 00:06:57,205
6120. Double cut away.

30
00:07:03,293 --> 00:07:06,893
I once saw Eddie Cochran
playing one of these.

31
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:10,630
But it had the front pickup modified
to a Gibson P-90.

32
00:07:12,496 --> 00:07:15,896
Wait. You actually saw Eddie Cochran play?

33
00:07:17,967 --> 00:07:19,967
Yeah, on YouTube.

34
00:07:20,698 --> 00:07:23,198
Right, of course man.

35
00:07:59,863 --> 00:08:04,663
- Hey, I've got something very special for you.
- We have what you need.

36
00:08:14,572 --> 00:08:18,672
I know you don't wanna play live,
I know you want to remain completely anonnymous

37
00:08:18,804 --> 00:08:21,804
But, you being so reclusive and everything is...

38
00:08:23,173 --> 00:08:26,673
...probably gonna make people to be more interested in your music.

39
00:08:28,718 --> 00:08:30,118
Yeah...
What a drag.

40
00:08:40,225 --> 00:08:42,225
Listen, Ian

41
00:08:42,369 --> 00:08:44,169
There is something you could do for me
Anything.
Anything man, what is it?

42
00:08:47,662 --> 00:08:49,762
I need a bullet.
A very special bullet.

43
00:08:52,273 --> 00:08:55,673
Really?
I got you that pack of shells of the 38 last year.

44
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:59,670
I know, the 38.
I need a 38 caliber bullet

45
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:04,250
- but made of wood.
- What, wooden bullet, seriously man?

46
00:09:04,346 --> 00:09:06,846
Made from the hardest and most dense wood that you can find.

47
00:09:08,521 --> 00:09:12,721
I'd suggest guaiacum wood, Lignum Vitae,
maybe snakewood, Piratinera Guianensis,

48
00:09:12,855 --> 00:09:16,555
Or posibly african black wood,
Dalbergia Melanoxylon.

49
00:09:17,777 --> 00:09:23,777
- You think you could find than someone who could make it for me?
- Yeah, but... could you just repeat the last couple.

50
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:28,310
guaiacum wood, Lignum Vitae,
snakewood, Piratinera Guianensis,

51
00:09:28,388 --> 00:09:31,388
black wood, Dalbergia Melanoxylon.

52
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,460
Okay. Yeah, I think I know someone but...

53
00:09:39,832 --> 00:09:41,832
what the hell for?

54
00:09:43,018 --> 00:09:44,618
It's for a...
a project.

55
00:09:48,184 --> 00:09:51,784
- A secret art project.
- Ok, cool, cool.

56
00:09:52,886 --> 00:09:54,886
Alright, let me think.

57
00:09:58,292 --> 00:10:00,292
Thank you, Adam.

58
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:04,830
The shellcase should be -metálico-
but the bullet has to be wood.

59
00:10:05,489 --> 00:10:08,289
- Just want one?
- Just the one, yeah.

60
00:10:11,969 --> 00:10:13,969
Okay, cool.

61
00:10:16,745 --> 00:10:20,045
Anything else weird...
Interesting you may need?

62
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:25,110
There's a warehouse that sells this kind of
softake amps

63
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:30,607
some german resistances, soviet tubes
I thought you may go there and check it out

64
00:10:30,795 --> 00:10:33,195
No, I'm good. Thank you.

65
00:10:34,723 --> 00:10:39,123
Okay.
Can I use your bathromm before I get out?

66
00:10:39,244 --> 00:10:43,044
Ah...
I'm afraid it's still out of order.

67
00:10:43,301 --> 00:10:45,301
Still?
I'm gonna get someone...

68
00:10:45,327 --> 00:10:47,327
- No, don't bother.
- It's really no bother...

69
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:49,419
No!

70
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:57,369
Look, Ian... I'm gonna fix it myself
I just haven't gone around to it yet.

71
00:10:58,887 --> 00:11:01,887
Please, feel free to piss in my garden.

72
00:12:20,423 --> 00:12:22,423
Bilal.

73
00:12:33,673 --> 00:12:36,673
(you look beautiful in french), madame Eve.

74
00:12:37,297 --> 00:12:39,297
(Gracias.)

75
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:45,950
So... Tell me, how is he?
Really.

76
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:50,830
My teacher is fragile.
But he has a strong spirit.

77
00:12:52,219 --> 00:12:54,519
He is in such good hands.

78
00:12:57,091 --> 00:12:59,091
He's my family.

79
00:12:59,588 --> 00:13:03,688
And I protect...
Protect his secrets.

80
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,960
And yours too.

81
00:15:25,381 --> 00:15:27,581
Mistress mine.

82
00:15:33,317 --> 00:15:36,217
It's just an hour before sunrise
I'm well aware of that, my dear.

83
00:15:39,376 --> 00:15:42,076
Is that the really good stuff?
Yes, Eve.

84
00:15:43,622 --> 00:15:45,572
From the french doctor?
Precisely.

85
00:15:49,046 --> 00:15:50,746
So...
How's the fabulous Christopher Marlowe tonight?

86
00:15:53,503 --> 00:15:58,003
I told you this! Never call me that name in public.

87
00:16:00,164 --> 00:16:02,164
You nutcase.

88
00:16:03,812 --> 00:16:06,612
I can keep a secret!
You should know that.

89
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:12,584
But I'm asking,
what most outrageously delicious literature scandal in history?

90
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:17,516
Dear Eve, that was 4 centuries ago.

91
00:16:17,588 --> 00:16:20,288
You've been wearing that westcoat for 4 centuries.

92
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:24,397
I was given this in 1585. It's one of my favourite garments.

93
00:16:26,996 --> 00:16:30,296
So, are you saying you're never gonna let the cat out of the bag?

94
00:16:31,936 --> 00:16:35,236
Couldn't we...
drop a hint here and there?

95
00:16:36,648 --> 00:16:39,248
It would cause such a thrilling chaos.

96
00:16:40,551 --> 00:16:44,951
I think the world has enough chaos

97
00:16:45,575 --> 00:16:47,575
to keep it going for the minute.

98
00:16:49,082 --> 00:16:51,082
Spoilsport.

99
00:18:01,564 --> 00:18:05,364
Jesuschrist!
You scared the shit out of me.

100
00:18:09,527 --> 00:18:15,527
I've sort of been expecting you recently for some reason,
doctor...

101
00:18:18,109 --> 00:18:21,309
- Doctor Faust.
- It's good to see you again, too, doctor...

102
00:18:21,328 --> 00:18:22,828
Doctor...
Watson.

103
00:18:39,057 --> 00:18:41,057
You know, uh...

104
00:18:41,147 --> 00:18:45,547
This whole setup is a bit unnerving for me.

105
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:51,810
Would you consider meeting somewhere
outside the hospital sometime?

106
00:18:52,251 --> 00:18:57,251
Instead of just appearing
unexpectedly, like a... Phantom.

107
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:02,239
That would require pretty arrengement.
Yeah, and it would be safer for me.

108
00:19:06,974 --> 00:19:12,274
I'd like to come to the source.
Besides, the mutual jeopardy makes me feel safer.

109
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:18,552
Now, If you excuse me. I haven't any spare time.

110
00:19:19,128 --> 00:19:23,728
Right, well then,
let me get you what you desire.

111
00:19:25,223 --> 00:19:27,223
doctor... Strangelove?

112
00:19:38,379 --> 00:19:40,379
type O negativo.

113
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:04,250
By the way,
that stethoscope of yours?

114
00:20:04,547 --> 00:20:07,747
It's for all practical props an antique.

115
00:20:08,545 --> 00:20:10,545
It's from the 1970's.

116
00:20:11,613 --> 00:20:14,113
- Even the 60's.
- Is it?

117
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,138
That guy gotta have to be from Cleveland.

118
00:24:53,573 --> 00:24:55,973
- Yeah?
- Adam.

119
00:24:57,538 --> 00:25:00,338
- Eve.
- Hey, darling.

120
00:25:01,231 --> 00:25:05,031
- Hang on a second, I want to see you.
- Oh, I want to see you too.

121
00:25:09,665 --> 00:25:14,965
What is that? Are you scrabbling about your
wires and knots, my old pet rat?

122
00:25:15,704 --> 00:25:18,704
Yeah, one second I just...

123
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:24,989
- Hello.
- There you are.

124
00:25:25,792 --> 00:25:28,592
Hello sweetheart.
What is it? You look tired.

125
00:25:31,876 --> 00:25:33,876
Do I?

126
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:38,670
I guess I am...
Any supply problems?

127
00:25:41,301 --> 00:25:43,010
No.
So, what is this, then?

128
00:25:58,778 --> 00:26:01,378
Can't you tell your wife what your problem is?

129
00:26:05,666 --> 00:26:09,466
It's the zombieism.
The way the treat the world.

130
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:17,471
It does feel like I'm the sands at the bottom
of an hourglass, or something.

131
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:20,011
Time to turn it over, then.

132
00:26:21,374 --> 00:26:23,774
Oh my liege lord...

133
00:26:24,564 --> 00:26:28,264
We've been here before...
Remember?

134
00:26:28,694 --> 00:26:33,594
And you missed all the real fun like
the Middle Ages, the tartars, the inquisitions...

135
00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:36,933
The floods, the plages...

136
00:26:46,255 --> 00:26:48,255
How about your music?

137
00:26:48,537 --> 00:26:53,637
I seem to be
writing a lot of funeral music.

138
00:26:55,085 --> 00:26:58,685
Oh, my darling, why don't you just come here
and kiss me?

139
00:27:00,117 --> 00:27:03,917
You used to love Tanger.
You loved the music.

140
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,795
Oh fuck.

141
00:27:18,356 --> 00:27:20,756
Alright. I'll come

142
00:27:21,285 --> 00:27:24,285
But I can't believe you're doing this to me again.

143
00:27:25,569 --> 00:27:27,869
It's the travelling what's such a drag.

144
00:27:30,321 --> 00:27:32,121
Eve...
I love you so much.

145
00:27:36,006 --> 00:27:38,106
I'll take that, for the journey.
Fucking hell.

146
00:31:09,349 --> 00:31:13,749
Yes. And is there a posibility of a night flight
from Tanger to Paris?

147
00:31:15,085 --> 00:31:19,685
Yes, that would work.
And then flying the following night from Paris to Detroit?

148
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:22,099
Is that correct? Wonderful.

149
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,780
Name of Fibonacci.

150
00:33:16,648 --> 00:33:18,948
Hey, man, I hope this isn't a bad time.

151
00:33:19,629 --> 00:33:22,829
I wanted to come right the way cause
I have a thing for you.

152
00:33:30,489 --> 00:33:32,789
Wooden bullet. 38 caliber.

153
00:33:33,885 --> 00:33:35,985
It's cocobolo.
Dalbergia Retusa.

154
00:33:40,089 --> 00:33:42,089
For your art project!

155
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:47,354
The guy made it for me no questions asked.
He said the wood it's so dense

156
00:33:47,409 --> 00:33:51,509
that it sinks on water.
I think thet make guitars out of it too.

157
00:33:52,929 --> 00:33:54,929
Both are true, yeah.

158
00:33:56,237 --> 00:33:58,637
It's perfect. Thank you, Ian.

159
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:01,079
No problem, man.

160
00:34:01,513 --> 00:34:03,813
You know, for a zombie...
You're alright.

161
00:34:05,568 --> 00:34:06,128
Thanks.

162
00:34:12,476 --> 00:34:14,476
Please.

163
00:34:17,608 --> 00:34:21,408
Oh, no man. You already paid me so much the other time.
It's okay.

164
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:23,830
Ian, please.
Bought my car and everything.

165
00:34:28,571 --> 00:34:30,571
Thank you, Adam.

166
00:34:35,569 --> 00:34:39,769
Anything else you may need, man?
Anything you want me to get you?

167
00:34:39,998 --> 00:34:43,598
There was some rock 'n roll kids here last night.
Ringing my doorbell.

168
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:45,939
- Really?
- Yeah.

169
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:49,220
How do they know where you live?
No one fucking lives out here.

170
00:34:50,349 --> 00:34:55,549
- I don't know but it's not cool. We've talked about this.
- I know, I know we did, man. It's not cool at all

171
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:58,935
It's completely fucked up.
How did they...?

172
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,660
Alright. I know
Don't worry.
I will spread some rumours

173
00:35:04,093 --> 00:35:07,993
very cautiously about where you might live
and I'll just throw away them off track.

174
00:35:10,523 --> 00:35:14,723
Whatever you need to do. Please, do it.
Just take care of it.

175
00:35:15,142 --> 00:35:17,142
- I'm on it.
- Okay.

176
00:35:17,285 --> 00:35:21,885
Look, I see you later
There's something I need to do.

177
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,380
You know

178
00:35:36,475 --> 00:35:38,475
I had a dream

179
00:35:40,634 --> 00:35:43,334
About your infamous little sister last night.

180
00:35:44,886 --> 00:35:49,186
You had a dream about Eva?
What's sort of dream, Kit?

181
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,599
Kit?

182
00:35:54,822 --> 00:35:57,722
What?
Oh sorry! I...

183
00:35:59,222 --> 00:36:01,522
Sorry, I just flew away for a minute.

184
00:36:01,976 --> 00:36:03,776
You are miles away!
In Italy, actually.

185
00:36:09,064 --> 00:36:11,064
Few hundred years ago.

186
00:36:12,088 --> 00:36:16,788
Was he painfully good-looking?
What?

187
00:36:20,586 --> 00:36:23,086
Look, I know I don't have to say this to you but

188
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:28,216
Please, be cautious.

189
00:36:30,824 --> 00:36:33,524
I couldn't bare that
something happened to you.

190
00:36:36,158 --> 00:36:39,458
Frankly, I don't understand why you don't live in the same place
Because you can't live without eachother.

191
00:36:44,847 --> 00:36:47,247
Anyway,
give him my regards to that...

192
00:36:48,983 --> 00:36:52,783
suidicial romantic scoundrel.

193
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:56,990
- Do you really think he is?
- Scoundrel?

194
00:37:01,249 --> 00:37:03,549
Well, let's hope he's just romantic.

195
00:37:05,121 --> 00:37:09,321
Even so I mainly blame Shelley
and Byron

196
00:37:09,404 --> 00:37:12,904
And some of those french arseholes
you saw him around with.

197
00:37:13,456 --> 00:37:16,956
Oh, I wish that I'd met him before
he wrote Hamlet.

198
00:37:18,919 --> 00:37:23,319
He'd provided the most perfect
role model imaginable.

199
00:38:17,533 --> 00:38:21,533
"Love alters not
with its brief hours and weeks"

200
00:38:21,611 --> 00:38:24,711
"But bears it out even
to the edge of doom."

201
00:38:25,422 --> 00:38:28,722
"If this be error
and upon me proved"

202
00:38:28,747 --> 00:38:32,247
"I never writ,
nor no man ever loved."

203
00:38:38,214 --> 00:38:40,214
Marlowe...

204
00:38:42,295 --> 00:38:45,295
Ouch! Oh man...

205
00:38:47,173 --> 00:38:49,173
I'm a mess.

206
00:38:49,788 --> 00:38:54,888
- Excuse me
- Oh no, let me get you something.

207
00:39:02,245 --> 00:39:04,245
Thank you.

208
00:39:18,197 --> 00:39:22,697
Damas y caballeros, empezamos el descenso
al aeropuerto Metro de Detroit.

209
00:39:22,785 --> 00:39:27,485
Thanks for flying with us on Air Lumiere.
And we hope to see you again soon.

210
00:40:23,318 --> 00:40:25,718
- I appreciate
- No problem.

211
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,620
Mephitis Mephitis.

212
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,720
My lady.

213
00:42:01,677 --> 00:42:03,677
May I?

214
00:42:50,654 --> 00:42:52,954
I love what you've done with the place.

215
00:42:57,152 --> 00:42:59,552
I love your newest music too.

216
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,280
It makes me think of when you gave that string quintet
to Schubert. Remember?

217
00:43:06,029 --> 00:43:10,229
- And he presented it as his own.
- Yeah, but I asked him to do that.

218
00:43:12,808 --> 00:43:14,808
I only gave him the adagio.

219
00:43:17,389 --> 00:43:19,389
Just to put something out there.

220
00:43:19,902 --> 00:43:22,202
Is that why you release this new stuff?

221
00:43:23,752 --> 00:43:25,752
I needed a reflection.

222
00:43:27,163 --> 00:43:30,563
See if it would echo back before...

223
00:43:31,737 --> 00:43:33,737
Before what?

224
00:43:36,385 --> 00:43:38,485
Oh, Adam.

225
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:44,760
You always have the convenience of the zombies
to blame when you get low.

226
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,624
What about all your heroes?

227
00:43:48,697 --> 00:43:50,697
- I don't have heroes.
- No?

228
00:43:51,518 --> 00:43:55,518
- What about your blessed scientists?
- The scientists?

229
00:43:56,371 --> 00:43:58,371
Look what they've done to them.

230
00:43:58,916 --> 00:44:00,916
Pythagoras, slaughtered.

231
00:44:01,834 --> 00:44:05,234
Galileo, imprisoned
Copernicus, ridiculed.

232
00:44:05,538 --> 00:44:08,638
Poor old Newton pushed into secrecy in alchemy.

233
00:44:08,761 --> 00:44:14,761
Tesla, destroyed.
His beautiful possibilities completely ignored.

234
00:44:16,613 --> 00:44:19,913
And still bitching about Darwin.
Still.

235
00:44:21,224 --> 00:44:23,224
So much for the scientists.

236
00:44:26,235 --> 00:44:28,535
And now they've succeeded in

237
00:44:28,841 --> 00:44:32,941
contaminating their own fucking blood.
Nevermind the water.

238
00:44:33,457 --> 00:44:39,757
Yeah, well
If we're gonna have a letany in
all the zombie atrocities in history

239
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,520
we would be here until the sun comes up.

240
00:44:46,804 --> 00:44:48,804
The sun is coming up.

241
00:44:54,071 --> 00:44:57,571
Should I tell you again about the
'Spooky action at a distance'?

242
00:44:58,143 --> 00:45:00,643
Einstein's theory of entanglement.

243
00:45:03,344 --> 00:45:07,644
I love the way you tell it.
But not now.

244
00:45:08,444 --> 00:45:10,544
We don't wanna be up all day.

245
00:45:13,068 --> 00:45:15,068
Eve?

246
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:19,980
Could you tell me how old this guitar is?

247
00:45:21,463 --> 00:45:25,963
I think is an L2, but...
I've never been able to date it exactly.

248
00:45:33,436 --> 00:45:35,436
Ah! She's a pretty one.

249
00:45:36,339 --> 00:45:40,939
A Gibson. 1905.

250
00:45:42,198 --> 00:45:43,898
She is old.

251
00:45:43,919 --> 00:45:49,319
Yes, my darling. But you know your dressing gown
is at least a century older.

252
00:45:50,578 --> 00:45:52,578
Is it?

253
00:46:48,481 --> 00:46:53,081
So this is your wilderness.
Detroit.

254
00:46:55,822 --> 00:46:57,822
Everybody left.

255
00:47:01,732 --> 00:47:04,732
- What's that?
- It's a Packard plant.

256
00:47:04,965 --> 00:47:08,165
Where they once built the most beautiful cars in the world.

257
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,870
Finished.
But this place will rise again.

258
00:47:14,854 --> 00:47:16,200
Will it?
Yeah
There's water here.

259
00:47:21,327 --> 00:47:24,027
When the cities in the south are burning.

260
00:47:26,524 --> 00:47:28,524
This place will bloom.

261
00:47:49,212 --> 00:47:53,712
Do you want to see the Motown museum?
Well, there's not much to look at from the outside.

262
00:47:55,328 --> 00:47:57,728
I'm one of the stag(?) girls myself.

263
00:48:00,658 --> 00:48:03,758
Actually there is something
I could show you.

264
00:48:05,995 --> 00:48:07,995
It's not far.

265
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:14,657
There. It's Jack White's house
It's Jack White's house.

266
00:48:18,227 --> 00:48:22,727
- Aah! I love Jack White
- It's where he did grow up

267
00:48:24,512 --> 00:48:28,112
Aw.. Little Jack White. Nice

268
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,280
You know he's actually his mother's seventh son?

269
00:48:38,195 --> 00:48:40,195
Haha. I bet he is

270
00:48:45,441 --> 00:48:48,241
And this is the famous Michigan Theatre.

271
00:48:49,683 --> 00:48:53,983
They built it back in the 1920's.
It was huge on the money.

272
00:48:55,458 --> 00:49:01,558
It was built ironically on the exact same site where
Henry Ford made his very first prototype.

273
00:49:05,148 --> 00:49:08,448
It used to be seats for over 4000 people in here.

274
00:49:09,066 --> 00:49:13,066
It's fantastic.
For what? for concerts?

275
00:49:13,292 --> 00:49:16,692
Concerts and as a movie house, can you imagine?

276
00:49:19,031 --> 00:49:21,431
Mirrors used to reflect the chandeliers...

277
00:49:24,801 --> 00:49:26,761
And now...
A car park.

278
00:49:46,699 --> 00:49:48,699
There goes your queen, playboy.

279
00:49:53,282 --> 00:49:56,982
By the way, your hero Christopher Marlowe sends his love

280
00:49:57,028 --> 00:49:59,028
I don't have heroes.

281
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,700
I know what you're doing.
You're trying to distract me

282
00:50:02,805 --> 00:50:05,405
Now no more talking.

283
00:50:07,617 --> 00:50:10,217
- Did you play chess with Byron?
- Eve! Please...

284
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:15,360
No, I want to know...!
You love telling me these things and I love to hear them.

285
00:50:15,626 --> 00:50:19,926
- So what was he like?
- Frankly, he was a pompous ass.

286
00:50:21,498 --> 00:50:23,498
Why am I not surprised?

287
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:29,610
And what about Mary?
What was Mary Wollstonecraft like?

288
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:34,280
Come ooon! Tell me, what was she like?

289
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:37,610
She was delicious.

290
00:50:39,265 --> 00:50:41,265
I bet she was.

291
00:50:42,357 --> 00:50:47,457
Talking of delicious, I have a surprise.
An experiment.

292
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:51,170
- That doesn't work by the way.
- Nono it does, I plentied in.

293
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:01,990
- What is that?
- O negative.

294
00:51:03,452 --> 00:51:08,752
- That's delicious.
- Blood on a stick.

295
00:51:08,933 --> 00:51:10,933
On a stick.

296
00:51:12,988 --> 00:51:15,288
- It's not bad.
- It's very refreshing.

297
00:51:15,368 --> 00:51:18,468
Specially when you're in a hot spot.

298
00:51:20,809 --> 00:51:23,009
Checkmate, my darling.

299
00:51:24,341 --> 00:51:27,141
Eve, you're ruthless. You're brutal.

300
00:51:28,005 --> 00:51:30,005
I'm a survivor, baby.

301
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:34,330
That's all the bloody talking.

302
00:51:40,751 --> 00:51:44,151
You gotta hear this one.
Charlie Feathers.

303
00:51:56,863 --> 00:52:00,363
- You know it?
- 1956.

304
00:52:01,986 --> 00:52:03,986
<i>'Can't Hardly Stand It'</i>

305
00:52:04,921 --> 00:52:06,921
Yeah.

306
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,550
Shit!

307
00:52:31,752 --> 00:52:34,252
Oh! What a lovely place!

308
00:52:35,128 --> 00:52:37,428
Vitis Vinifera, hello.

309
00:52:45,368 --> 00:52:48,368
Look at that.
Fucking zombie shit.

310
00:52:49,368 --> 00:52:53,968
In greed.
It's so antiquated. What century is this?

311
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:57,980
Tesla had lightbulbs and not even a plug-in in 1895.

312
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:01,720
- But it's not even connected!
- Yeah I disconnected it all out.

313
00:53:08,603 --> 00:53:13,103
Oh!
What a hidden treasure, my darling! Did you make that?

314
00:53:13,513 --> 00:53:19,713
- Well, I cabled it together from bits and pieces.
- How beautiful! You're an alchimist!

315
00:53:20,569 --> 00:53:25,669
I just need to check the charges and the connections.

316
00:53:26,648 --> 00:53:29,048
This may need a callibration.

317
00:53:31,705 --> 00:53:35,605
- Are these the antennas?
- Yeah

318
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:41,220
They're receiving
electrical information from the athmosphere

319
00:53:41,667 --> 00:53:44,967
- From outer space?
- They (?) into energy.

320
00:53:45,614 --> 00:53:47,614
(?)

321
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:50,080
Hang on. Let me just see this

322
00:54:10,147 --> 00:54:12,147
Amanita Muscaria.

323
00:54:13,466 --> 00:54:15,466
How odd.

324
00:54:17,416 --> 00:54:19,416
- Adam?
- Yeah?

325
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,600
Have you noticed these?

326
00:54:23,662 --> 00:54:25,662
Yeah.

327
00:54:27,656 --> 00:54:30,756
Fly garrack. They're behaving very strange though

328
00:54:31,597 --> 00:54:33,797
- But this is not the season!
- I know.

329
00:54:34,269 --> 00:54:37,669
They kind of appear and then disappear and reappear those caps.

330
00:54:38,271 --> 00:54:41,371
I guess they're receiving information of the atmosphere I might have tell them.

331
00:54:42,961 --> 00:54:46,361
This puts to show we don't know shit about fungus.

332
00:54:47,777 --> 00:54:51,177
Maybe the life from the planet couldn't live without them

333
00:54:52,842 --> 00:54:55,242
You know you guys shouldn't really be here.

334
00:54:56,245 --> 00:54:58,245
Not until the Autumn.

335
00:55:11,285 --> 00:55:15,785
- Evening.
- What's going on, my love? Are we playing doctors?

336
00:55:16,408 --> 00:55:19,608
I am.
I've got to go after our source.

337
00:55:19,711 --> 00:55:22,311
- Am I not included?
- Not this time.

338
00:55:22,845 --> 00:55:26,245
1968. you could do with a new one.

339
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:32,230
Have you ever used this on anyone?
doctor... Faust? Right

340
00:55:37,064 --> 00:55:39,064
What is it, my darling?

341
00:55:40,318 --> 00:55:42,018
I had a dream
about your sister.

342
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:52,050
- Not a good one, then.
- Well I suppose it could've been worse

343
00:55:52,378 --> 00:55:54,378
But not that much.

344
00:55:58,735 --> 00:56:01,035
- Back in a flash.
- Hope so.

345
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:04,500
Good luck with the surgery, doctor..

346
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:22,942
June 23rd. 1868.

347
00:56:25,254 --> 00:56:27,254
Our third wedding.

348
00:56:28,052 --> 00:56:30,352
We look so young!

349
00:57:00,921 --> 00:57:02,921
Marlowe...

350
00:57:36,952 --> 00:57:38,952
Dalbergia Retusa?

351
00:57:44,305 --> 00:57:46,305
This has been newly made.

352
00:58:02,888 --> 00:58:07,188
You're looking awfully pale, doctor... Caligary.

353
00:58:08,427 --> 00:58:11,227
Maybe you need to get a little more sunlight.

354
00:58:12,084 --> 00:58:15,784
Vitamine D deficiency can have serious consecuences.

355
00:58:45,213 --> 00:58:47,213
Fresh blood, baby.

356
00:58:50,278 --> 00:58:51,878
What's this about?
Just tell me that you haven't been in trouble
with one of the others

357
00:58:55,049 --> 00:58:56,749
Please tell me that.

358
00:58:58,396 --> 00:59:00,196
I don't see any others.
Ever.

359
00:59:06,536 --> 00:59:08,536
Okay.

360
00:59:19,213 --> 00:59:21,713
Don't ever fuck around like that.

361
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:24,375
Just playing a part in your story.

362
00:59:27,587 --> 00:59:29,587
It's the zombies I'm sick of...

363
00:59:31,271 --> 00:59:35,171
And the fear...
of their own fucking imaginations.

364
00:59:35,257 --> 00:59:37,557
My darling! That's true

365
00:59:40,227 --> 00:59:47,027
Meanwhile...
Just tell me what's so not frightening about that?

366
01:00:22,056 --> 01:00:25,056
How can you have lived for so long

367
01:00:25,571 --> 01:00:27,871
and still not get it?

368
01:00:30,699 --> 01:00:35,899
This self-obsession, is a waste...
...of living!

369
01:00:38,002 --> 01:00:42,502
It could be spent on surviving things

370
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:48,860
Appreciating nature,
nurturing kindness, and friendship...

371
01:00:50,914 --> 01:00:53,114
and dancing!

372
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:02,220
You've been pretty lucky in love, though

373
01:01:04,205 --> 01:01:06,705
If I may say so.

374
01:03:44,852 --> 01:03:46,852
It's a full moon.

375
01:03:49,391 --> 01:03:53,691
Did you know that there's a diamond out there
of the size of a planet?

376
01:03:56,726 --> 01:03:59,926
It's a white dwarf of compressed heart of a star.

377
01:04:01,424 --> 01:04:04,224
And it's not only a radiant diamond

378
01:04:04,677 --> 01:04:09,077
but also it makes the music of a gigantic gong.

379
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:12,930
A diamond...

380
01:04:14,540 --> 01:04:18,340
That it makes the music of a gigantic gong.

381
01:04:20,601 --> 01:04:25,201
- Where is it?
- It's just... 50 light-years away.

382
01:04:26,076 --> 01:04:28,276
In the constellation Centaurus.
Mmh...

383
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:33,940
I wonder what it sounds like.

384
01:04:58,616 --> 01:05:00,616
I have to tell you something.

385
01:05:03,671 --> 01:05:06,171
I... also had a dream about my sister.

386
01:05:08,688 --> 01:05:12,188
As did Marlowe before I left Tanger.

387
01:05:12,273 --> 01:05:13,873
I think she's looking for us.
Fuck!

388
01:05:17,555 --> 01:05:21,355
Well... I mean, it's been quite sometime
Yeah, not long enough.

389
01:05:25,191 --> 01:05:28,591
Shouldn't she be sleeping in a fucking coffin somewhere in her own?
Probably with a wooden stack sunk in?

390
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:33,561
- Adam, she's my sister.
- Is she now?

391
01:05:33,669 --> 01:05:36,669
Well, we are...
Related by blood

392
01:06:06,434 --> 01:06:08,434
I didn't leave these lights on.

393
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:16,260
That's your music?

394
01:06:52,044 --> 01:06:54,044
Eva.

395
01:06:55,033 --> 01:06:57,033
What the fuck are you doing here?

396
01:06:58,348 --> 01:07:01,248
Oh my god! It's so great to see you!

397
01:07:06,626 --> 01:07:08,726
You're still so beautiful.

398
01:07:10,286 --> 01:07:12,286
May I?

399
01:07:15,512 --> 01:07:18,212
My amazing sister,
I missed you.

400
01:07:19,373 --> 01:07:22,873
- Did you get my message?
- I think I might have. I had a dream.

401
01:07:22,967 --> 01:07:25,667
Aw, how cool! It works!

402
01:07:25,806 --> 01:07:28,206
There's your "spooky action at a distance".

403
01:07:28,251 --> 01:07:29,974
Yeah, well spooky action anyway.
What are you guys talking about?

404
01:07:32,377 --> 01:07:37,777
You do know that is very bad luck to cross a threshold without being invited.

405
01:07:39,652 --> 01:07:44,152
- Are you still afraid of garlic?
- I'm not talking about myths here, Eva.

406
01:07:46,251 --> 01:07:50,651
You know it's also bad luck to listen to someone's private music
without invitation?

407
01:07:50,736 --> 01:07:54,636
My god, I love it Adam! It's totally brilliant.
Can I get a download?

408
01:07:54,761 --> 01:07:56,125
No.
So? Were you just passing through Detroit?

409
01:08:00,033 --> 01:08:03,333
Yeah!
No! I mean I came to see you!

410
01:08:03,954 --> 01:08:05,894
I've been living in LA.
Great.

411
01:08:07,473 --> 01:08:10,073
The zombie central.
Are you alone?

412
01:08:13,053 --> 01:08:15,013
No...
I'm here with you guys!

413
01:08:19,914 --> 01:08:23,014
Fuck.
Well, you can't stay here

414
01:08:23,286 --> 01:08:26,386
- Adam!
- No fucking way! Not after last time

415
01:08:26,426 --> 01:08:28,826
Oh, Adam, It's been 87 years.

416
01:08:29,976 --> 01:08:31,796
What? When?
Are you still upset about the Paris thing?

417
01:08:38,059 --> 01:08:40,009
Well, are you okay?
Yeah but I'm...
I'm really really really hungry

418
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:47,640
Do you maybe have something?

419
01:08:49,909 --> 01:08:52,409
Did you smell it all the way from LA?

420
01:08:53,974 --> 01:08:55,974
Go on.

421
01:09:02,361 --> 01:09:05,461
- Eva...
- What? I just wanna see where you keep it

422
01:09:05,762 --> 01:09:07,762
No!

423
01:09:14,430 --> 01:09:17,430
Well, it's so amazing to see you.

424
01:09:23,477 --> 01:09:25,977
We're gonna have so much fun together.

425
01:09:30,669 --> 01:09:33,069
She drank a whole bottle of O negative.

426
01:09:35,183 --> 01:09:37,183
I know.

427
01:09:38,045 --> 01:09:41,245
But she's been travelling and that fries you, you know?

428
01:09:45,142 --> 01:09:50,742
We'll all be alright.
It's always a bit weird with family.

429
01:10:00,332 --> 01:10:05,132
- Where is she sleeping now?
- I put her in that little bedroom downstairs.

430
01:10:05,529 --> 01:10:09,329
- Which little bedroom?
- You know, the little one down the corridor.

431
01:10:14,173 --> 01:10:16,973
I'll have to put my tapes in the bloody safe now.

432
01:10:17,172 --> 01:10:19,572
Don't worry. Go to sleep now.

433
01:10:20,805 --> 01:10:23,605
She's out god and it's getting light out.

434
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:26,719
We can talk when we will get up tonight.

435
01:10:27,857 --> 01:10:32,257
Just think of that magic gong musical diamond in the sky

436
01:10:32,997 --> 01:10:34,997
Above us now.

437
01:10:58,359 --> 01:10:59,859
Eve! Adam!

438
01:11:00,008 --> 01:11:02,008
- What is it Eva?
- Can I come in?

439
01:11:02,409 --> 01:11:04,409
Mmmmh... no.

440
01:11:05,262 --> 01:11:07,862
Isn't time to get up?
Darling, can we sleep a little longer?

441
01:11:15,678 --> 01:11:19,878
But it's dark out already.
Starving.

442
01:11:20,071 --> 01:11:22,371
Go away, we're still sleeping.

443
01:11:22,946 --> 01:11:26,846
In a little while we'll all get up and have breakfast together, alright?

444
01:11:27,682 --> 01:11:30,582
- Some of the good stuff?
- Sure.

445
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:32,820
Where do you keep it?

446
01:11:34,998 --> 01:11:39,498
- You could and get dressed and we'll bring you some, alright?
- Okay.

447
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:44,090
Peek-a-boo!

448
01:11:44,207 --> 01:11:46,207
I see you!

449
01:12:30,579 --> 01:12:32,779
What the hell is this?

450
01:12:35,186 --> 01:12:38,786
Oh! This is from french television in 1975.
Hey!

451
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:47,812
You're pushing your luck, Eva.
Why did you turn it off?

452
01:12:48,589 --> 01:12:50,589
I love that, I found it on YouTube.

453
01:12:51,159 --> 01:12:52,959
Yeah, of course she did...
I don't feel well.

454
01:12:55,757 --> 01:12:58,857
What is this sweetheart?
You think is all the travelling?

455
01:12:58,953 --> 01:13:00,086
Maybe.
It's probably blood-poisoning.

456
01:13:02,014 --> 01:13:04,314
- Don't joke Adam.
- I'm not!

457
01:13:04,439 --> 01:13:06,439
Are you taking care of your nutrition?

458
01:13:06,463 --> 01:13:09,863
You know you've got to be very careful.
There's a lot of contamination around

459
01:13:09,905 --> 01:13:14,805
I try.
Hey! You guys fed without me!

460
01:13:18,938 --> 01:13:21,138
Take it easy! Shit!

461
01:13:51,892 --> 01:13:54,092
My god, that is good I want more.
No, even more that enough.

462
01:13:57,029 --> 01:14:01,229
This is pure shit,
and you're drying out all our fucking supplies. So take it easy.

463
01:14:02,019 --> 01:14:03,419
Fine.
Then I wanna hear some of your music.

464
01:14:07,163 --> 01:14:09,663
No, I told you, it's private.

465
01:14:10,013 --> 01:14:13,013
Oh yeah?
Well, how could I heard it in LA, then?

466
01:14:13,070 --> 01:14:15,260
What do you mean you heard it in LA. Where did you hear it?
At some underground music club.

467
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:19,280
I don't believe you.
So don't.

468
01:14:21,741 --> 01:14:25,841
- How did you know was mine then?
- Oh come on, I could tell inmediately!

469
01:14:26,067 --> 01:14:29,667
I might have been born in night but I wasn't born last night.

470
01:14:44,168 --> 01:14:46,468
Fine.
But I'm gonna go out.

471
01:14:47,027 --> 01:14:49,627
- I wanna hear some music
- Good idea. Go out

472
01:14:49,786 --> 01:14:51,886
But I wanna go with you two!

473
01:14:52,822 --> 01:14:54,252
No.
You're so fucking boring!

474
01:14:56,688 --> 01:14:59,088
I bet he never takes you out. Ever, right?

475
01:14:59,603 --> 01:15:02,703
Well, no. We do go for a drive sometimes to time.

476
01:15:03,136 --> 01:15:06,436
Oh! a drive!
That's exciting.

477
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:10,103
I mean, go somewhere!
Where there's music.

478
01:15:10,471 --> 01:15:13,971
- Don't you wanna go, Eve?
- Well, I wouldn't mind

479
01:15:14,279 --> 01:15:16,279
We are in Detroit.

480
01:15:16,814 --> 01:15:18,814
- Yeah!
- No!

481
01:15:19,117 --> 01:15:20,617
Adam is going to take us out!
No! Adam is not going to take you out.

482
01:16:45,873 --> 01:16:48,973
- Awesome!
- They were great

483
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:04,080
You guys have awesome gloves, man
Where did you get them?

484
01:17:06,071 --> 01:17:09,371
- Hey, Ian.
- Scott, how are you man, it's nice to see you.

485
01:17:09,448 --> 01:17:12,448
- Yeah, the last time I saw you were with Daniel
- I think so, yeah

486
01:17:13,218 --> 01:17:15,718
I've got something to you.
I'll be right back.

487
01:17:23,369 --> 01:17:26,069
- That's great
- I know. So good

488
01:17:26,152 --> 01:17:30,852
- So, you remember that 12 inches?
- Oh yeah yeah.

489
01:17:48,644 --> 01:17:53,144
- So check it out, man. Triple pack
- Yeah

490
01:17:53,205 --> 01:17:55,905
- 180gr vinyl?
- 180 grame, man.

491
01:17:55,992 --> 01:17:58,892
- Amazing.
- No printing anywhere.

492
01:17:59,384 --> 01:18:03,384
yeah that's awesome.
So misterious.

493
01:18:09,468 --> 01:18:11,468
Thanks, man.

494
01:18:16,990 --> 01:18:22,690
Wow, man, this is so great you know?
I...

495
01:18:23,149 --> 01:18:26,949
I couldn't get this guy just to come out
and see some live music, you know?

496
01:18:27,049 --> 01:18:29,149
- Do you like it, Adam?
- Yes

497
01:18:29,345 --> 01:18:32,345
- Adam! You wanna meet White Nails, man?
- No.

498
01:18:33,443 --> 01:18:35,843
Cool, then.

499
01:18:54,219 --> 01:19:00,219
Oh, I'm so sorry! So rude,
can I get you a beer or anything, Eve? some drink?

500
01:19:00,686 --> 01:19:02,686
I'm Eva, she's Eve.

501
01:19:04,381 --> 01:19:08,181
I'm so sorry.
Eve, can I get you something? a beer?

502
01:19:08,201 --> 01:19:11,401
- No, thank you, nothing
- Eva?

503
01:19:13,532 --> 01:19:16,032
Oh! Very nice.
You brought your own, what is that?

504
01:19:16,137 --> 01:19:18,637
- Jagermeister?
- Where did you get that?

505
01:19:18,766 --> 01:19:22,766
- I found it at home before we left.
- At home? You mean at my house?

506
01:19:22,895 --> 01:19:24,995
- Yeah, want some?
- No.

507
01:19:25,178 --> 01:19:27,178
I'll have some.

508
01:19:44,862 --> 01:19:48,862
- Do you think that I can get some of it?
- Sure

509
01:19:49,190 --> 01:19:51,190
Cool.

510
01:19:52,649 --> 01:19:58,649
Wow, man.
That was like martial arts top shit

511
01:19:58,743 --> 01:20:02,943
And this guy is just.. amazing man, you know?

512
01:20:03,056 --> 01:20:05,256
- He's brilliant.
- He is brilliant.

513
01:20:05,328 --> 01:20:08,628
You know I can't tell anyone about him?
How weird is that!

514
01:20:08,825 --> 01:20:12,125
I had to sign a confidentiality term and everything.

515
01:20:13,775 --> 01:20:15,775
That's your music.

516
01:20:31,631 --> 01:20:35,931
- Hey, you wanna dance with me, rock 'n roll star?
- What now?

517
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:38,100
Yeah.

518
01:21:02,753 --> 01:21:05,253
Eve, we gotta go.
Right now.

519
01:21:05,317 --> 01:21:10,417
Alright. Just cool and (?) yourself
Just... Go easy.

520
01:21:12,482 --> 01:21:14,482
Hey

521
01:21:40,018 --> 01:21:42,018
Eva.

522
01:21:44,832 --> 01:21:48,832
- Adam, I think we could hear some of your new stuff?
- No it's not a good time.

523
01:21:48,855 --> 01:21:51,855
Seems like a great time, we're all here you know?

524
01:21:54,906 --> 01:21:58,506
Yeah I got you, I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm just...
...deadly excited.

525
01:21:58,916 --> 01:22:00,916
Me too.

526
01:22:02,390 --> 01:22:04,390
Adam?

527
01:22:06,071 --> 01:22:09,271
Adam, can I have that flask back, please?

528
01:22:11,515 --> 01:22:14,515
No, Eva. No more tonight.

529
01:22:15,628 --> 01:22:19,228
- I'm just really thirsty.
- I'm think we just could go to bed.

530
01:22:19,554 --> 01:22:21,554
I mean it's getting light out.

531
01:22:21,607 --> 01:22:24,707
- I think it's time to retire.
- Oh, do you wanna share some of this?

532
01:22:25,676 --> 01:22:30,476
Ian. I think, uhm...
I think it's time for you to go.

533
01:22:31,945 --> 01:22:34,945
- Yeah
- He's gonna go as soon as he's finished his little beer

534
01:22:35,070 --> 01:22:37,870
Yeah, I should, I should get going

535
01:22:38,376 --> 01:22:42,976
- Yeah, he's just going in just a second.
- That's an excellent idea. Goodnight, baby.

536
01:22:43,412 --> 01:22:46,312
Goodnight Ian, very nice to meet you.
I hope yo see you again.

537
01:22:46,369 --> 01:22:48,369
Yeah, I sure hope so.

538
01:22:49,876 --> 01:22:53,876
- You're leaving soon, right?
- Yeah, I'm going then.

539
01:23:17,155 --> 01:23:21,155
Yeah, that's I'm getting out here.

540
01:23:22,296 --> 01:23:24,296
Really?

541
01:23:34,257 --> 01:23:37,257
Peek-a-boo!
I see you!

542
01:23:43,218 --> 01:23:45,218
Peek-a

543
01:23:47,341 --> 01:23:51,241
Don't even dare...
Shit

544
01:23:56,033 --> 01:23:58,233
- It's all dark outside?
- Yeah

545
01:24:01,809 --> 01:24:05,909
- What are you doing with this?
- I filled a little something for Eva.

546
01:24:06,685 --> 01:24:08,156
Oh, fuck...
I'm gonna check on her.

547
01:24:10,774 --> 01:24:14,274
But you're alright, darling.
She's gotta go.

548
01:24:15,284 --> 01:24:17,784
I need you all to myself again.

549
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:23,420
Good idea.
Before it's too late.

550
01:24:34,653 --> 01:24:36,653
I'll get some getting up then.

551
01:24:46,912 --> 01:24:48,912
Eva?

552
01:24:58,161 --> 01:25:00,161
Eva!

553
01:25:34,765 --> 01:25:36,765
Fuck!

554
01:25:41,907 --> 01:25:45,307
- Eve!
- This is the bloody 21st century.

555
01:25:45,368 --> 01:25:49,868
Ahh I didn't mean to!
He was just so cute and now I feel sick.

556
01:25:49,940 --> 01:25:53,240
What did you expect?
He's from the fucking music industry!

557
01:25:53,340 --> 01:25:55,340
Oh, back off!

558
01:26:06,246 --> 01:26:07,710
You drank Ian.
Adam!

559
01:26:08,731 --> 01:26:10,431
You drank...
...Ian.

560
01:26:13,559 --> 01:26:15,559
Sorry!

561
01:26:16,702 --> 01:26:19,302
We can solve this. Eva is leaving.

562
01:26:20,154 --> 01:26:22,754
Just get off me, Eve!

563
01:26:24,985 --> 01:26:29,985
- How many times!
- I don't mean to!

564
01:26:31,751 --> 01:26:33,751
Let go!

565
01:26:35,860 --> 01:26:38,020
What the fuck? That's my stuff!
Get the fuck out of my house.

566
01:26:42,887 --> 01:26:44,153
Where am I supposed to go?
Go back and rot in fucking LA.

567
01:26:47,411 --> 01:26:50,811
You know what you guys are?
You're condescending snobs!

568
01:26:50,971 --> 01:26:52,671
You've no fucking idea.
Fuck you!

569
01:26:58,377 --> 01:27:00,377
Go fuck each other!

570
01:27:16,380 --> 01:27:21,780
Oh, my love
He seemed such a lovely fellow.

571
01:27:25,879 --> 01:27:27,879
Why couldn't she just have turned him?

572
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:31,500
- Can anybody link you two?
- You joking?

573
01:27:32,581 --> 01:27:38,081
- We were all together last night.
- So much for that confidentiality agreement.

574
01:27:40,532 --> 01:27:44,632
- Where's his car?
- He left it down by the club.

575
01:27:44,729 --> 01:27:47,029
Yeah, well. Then, it'll be gone in a day or two

576
01:27:54,515 --> 01:27:58,715
- Look what she did to my Gibson
- The 1905.

577
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:09,980
Wow...
Look how beautifully made is inside!

578
01:28:11,692 --> 01:28:13,692
Yeah.

579
01:28:32,174 --> 01:28:37,474
- Have you got a bit of old carpet?
- Behind the sofa.

580
01:28:46,492 --> 01:28:52,192
- Shall we?
- Yeah...

581
01:28:58,212 --> 01:29:00,212
- Hang on
- That's it.

582
01:29:00,313 --> 01:29:02,313
- You got it?
- Yeah

583
01:29:04,025 --> 01:29:06,625
- His feet first.
- yeah, his feet first.

584
01:29:10,453 --> 01:29:12,453
Careful with his head

585
01:29:56,809 --> 01:29:58,809
What are we gonna do with him?

586
01:30:02,291 --> 01:30:04,391
I mean it's not like the old days

587
01:30:05,303 --> 01:30:09,103
when we could just choke them in the Thames alongside the
rest of the tuberculous floaters.

588
01:30:10,195 --> 01:30:12,195
Any other ideas?

589
01:30:58,353 --> 01:31:01,453
Canis Latrans, how lovely.

590
01:31:02,942 --> 01:31:07,942
- I think they're clocking you.
- Yeah. They're all over Detroit

591
01:31:12,153 --> 01:31:14,153
Come on, Eve.

592
01:31:34,321 --> 01:31:37,321
Don't even ask. Ready?

593
01:32:06,953 --> 01:32:08,953
That surely was visual.

594
01:32:20,632 --> 01:32:23,932
Hello? Good evening
I'd like to book

595
01:32:23,997 --> 01:32:26,697
two flights from Detroit to Tanger.
Travelling at night.

596
01:32:29,377 --> 01:32:31,377
Who is it?

597
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:36,000
Some rock 'n roll zombie kids.

598
01:32:36,944 --> 01:32:40,644
- They're on to me.
- Yes, but be grateful is not the police.

599
01:32:43,059 --> 01:32:46,959
Yes, I'm still here.
Thank you.

600
01:32:47,093 --> 01:32:52,293
Yes. Two tickets. First class.
Leaving and arriving at night, please.

601
01:32:52,629 --> 01:32:55,529
Yes, I'm sorry.
I know it's complicated.

602
01:32:57,206 --> 01:33:01,306
Connecting through London?
Nono I'm sorry, London is not good.

603
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:05,700
Yeah.
Is there another connection?

604
01:33:09,165 --> 01:33:10,010
Madrid?
Madrid's fine.

605
01:33:13,162 --> 01:33:15,662
Yes, two travellers.
And no lugagge.

606
01:33:16,115 --> 01:33:20,715
- What about all my instruments?
- My darling! The world is full of beautiful instruments.

607
01:33:21,396 --> 01:33:24,296
I'm gonna find you the magical instrument in Tanger.

608
01:33:25,716 --> 01:33:29,716
- Yes. Just carry on.
- Can we carry on blood?

609
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:33,040
Kit has the best stuff
As soon as we arrive.

610
01:33:34,514 --> 01:33:36,914
Yes, credit card, which would you like?

611
01:33:39,604 --> 01:33:42,104
Yes. The names of...

612
01:33:42,357 --> 01:33:46,857
Stephen Dedalus and Daisy Buchanan.

613
01:33:47,281 --> 01:33:48,769
Chet Atkins...
Dates of birth...?

614
01:36:07,324 --> 01:36:09,324
You need something?

615
01:36:22,042 --> 01:36:28,042
Mosieur? Madame? J'ai quelque chose spécial por vous
I have something very special for you.

616
01:36:37,843 --> 01:36:40,743
Not far from there now. Come on.

617
01:37:49,426 --> 01:37:52,126
Shit, Marlowe, where are you?

618
01:38:00,009 --> 01:38:02,009
Adam!

619
01:38:11,763 --> 01:38:14,263
- What was that for?
- Come on.

620
01:38:17,748 --> 01:38:19,748
Where are we?

621
01:38:24,421 --> 01:38:28,321
- Did you find Marlowe?
- No, we gotta go find him. You gotta get up, come on

622
01:38:30,658 --> 01:38:33,058
Fuck, can't even fucking walk.

623
01:39:09,860 --> 01:39:13,360
I've got something very special for you
I have what you need

624
01:39:15,062 --> 01:39:17,362
Not what I need.

625
01:39:57,631 --> 01:39:59,731
Oh fuck, Kit!

626
01:40:10,181 --> 01:40:12,381
- Bilal.
- Madam Eve?

627
01:40:16,929 --> 01:40:18,929
- Pleasure.
- Bilal.

628
01:40:19,456 --> 01:40:21,456
Come in, come in.

629
01:40:26,905 --> 01:40:31,305
Madam Eve, my teacher is not well.

630
01:40:32,981 --> 01:40:36,081
This is a very, very bad situation.

631
01:40:37,660 --> 01:40:39,660
Very bad.

632
01:40:39,866 --> 01:40:42,066
Maybe your visit can do good

633
01:40:44,203 --> 01:40:46,203
Please

634
01:41:00,776 --> 01:41:02,776
Please

635
01:41:11,657 --> 01:41:16,657
Well, well...
Look at the cat that dragged in.

636
01:41:28,711 --> 01:41:31,011
I look like shit.

637
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:37,600
My old darling..,

638
01:41:44,355 --> 01:41:46,355
Ohh yeah

639
01:41:48,204 --> 01:41:50,804
"What a piece of work is a man!"

640
01:41:52,157 --> 01:41:55,157
"What are these acquantainces of dust?"

641
01:41:58,093 --> 01:42:00,093
What happened, Kit?

642
01:42:12,996 --> 01:42:16,096
This is the very last bottle of good stuff.

643
01:42:37,975 --> 01:42:40,475
No more good french doctor.

644
01:42:46,008 --> 01:42:48,008
They got some bad stuff.

645
01:42:50,827 --> 01:42:52,827
Contaminated.

646
01:42:53,979 --> 01:42:56,579
Avoid the hospital here.

647
01:43:02,531 --> 01:43:04,931
Still been scratching away, though, Kit?

648
01:43:05,416 --> 01:43:09,716
Oh, yeah.
Here and there over the centuries.

649
01:43:14,214 --> 01:43:16,214
Bilal.

650
01:43:20,849 --> 01:43:27,049
Bilal's an excellent writer in his own writing

651
01:43:29,152 --> 01:43:33,652
- Maybe not yet.
- Humility...

652
01:43:34,813 --> 01:43:36,813
Get you nowhere.

653
01:43:39,452 --> 01:43:41,452
There's the proof of that

654
01:43:42,642 --> 01:43:46,542
Humility zombie philistine.

655
01:43:50,268 --> 01:43:56,068
The game paid off though, Kit.
You still got the work out there.

656
01:43:56,983 --> 01:43:58,983
Never had much choice

657
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:04,620
It's all...
Very political.

658
01:44:07,468 --> 01:44:10,168
Anyway, I was supposed to be...
Dead.

659
01:44:16,596 --> 01:44:22,296
And now, at last...

660
01:44:26,387 --> 01:44:28,387
I shall be.

661
01:46:01,755 --> 01:46:03,755
Oh, Eve.

662
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:52,280
Oh, look at that shit.

663
01:47:04,773 --> 01:47:06,773
- What are we gonna do?
- What are we gonna do?

664
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:19,004
Well, I know what I'm gonna do.

665
01:47:23,732 --> 01:47:25,732
I'm gonna get you that present.

666
01:47:27,877 --> 01:47:30,677
Give me all your money, baby.

667
01:47:33,094 --> 01:47:35,094
Come on.

668
01:47:52,901 --> 01:47:57,901
Now.
Look, you stay here. Okay?

669
01:47:58,620 --> 01:48:01,820
And I'm gonna go around the corner.
Just for a minute.

670
01:48:04,335 --> 01:48:06,335
No funny business.

671
01:48:16,283 --> 01:48:18,283
OK.

672
01:51:36,934 --> 01:51:39,234
Eve, this girl is fantastic.

673
01:51:39,527 --> 01:51:44,327
Jasmine, she's libanese.
I'm sure she'll be very famous.

674
01:51:44,666 --> 01:51:46,666
God, I hope not.

675
01:51:47,326 --> 01:51:49,326
She is way too good for that.

676
01:51:51,124 --> 01:51:53,124
Come on, baby.

677
01:51:59,476 --> 01:52:01,476
Look at the bow.

678
01:52:10,262 --> 01:52:12,262
Dalbergia Retusa?

679
01:52:29,345 --> 01:52:31,345
It's beautiful.

680
01:52:34,591 --> 01:52:36,591
Thank you.

681
01:52:55,534 --> 01:52:58,234
82% of human blood is water.

682
01:53:00,079 --> 01:53:04,079
Have the water was started yet?
Or they're still with the oil?

683
01:53:04,499 --> 01:53:06,499
Yes, they're just starting that.

684
01:53:08,449 --> 01:53:12,949
They'll only figure out when it's too late.

685
01:53:15,449 --> 01:53:18,049
How much of the human body is water?

686
01:53:18,890 --> 01:53:20,890
55 to 60%.

687
01:53:21,073 --> 01:53:23,473
And how much the Earth surface?

688
01:53:25,350 --> 01:53:27,350
Up 70% is ocean and...

689
01:53:28,872 --> 01:53:32,272
then they're lakes,
and the rivers...

690
01:53:57,711 --> 01:54:01,311
Fuck.
I'm barely still here.

691
01:54:04,161 --> 01:54:06,161
We're finished, aren't we?

692
01:54:29,533 --> 01:54:32,233
Tell me now about entanglement.

693
01:54:34,140 --> 01:54:37,040
Einstein's spooky action at a distance.

694
01:54:37,502 --> 01:54:40,002
Is it related to quantum theory?

695
01:54:43,097 --> 01:54:45,097
No. I mean

696
01:54:45,307 --> 01:54:47,607
It's not a theory. It's proven.

697
01:54:48,469 --> 01:54:50,469
How is it all again?

698
01:54:52,137 --> 01:54:54,737
When you separate an entwined particle

699
01:54:55,455 --> 01:54:58,555
And move both parts
away from the other

700
01:54:59,876 --> 01:55:02,576
Even at opposite ends of the universe

701
01:55:02,700 --> 01:55:05,600
If you alter or affect one,

702
01:55:06,070 --> 01:55:09,170
The other will be identically altered or affected.

703
01:55:10,576 --> 01:55:11,900
- Spooky.
- Even at opposite ends on the universe?

704
01:55:16,360 --> 01:55:18,360
Yeah.

705
01:55:23,072 --> 01:55:25,072
Is that what we're thinking?

706
01:55:27,499 --> 01:55:31,999
Adam, really.
So fucking 15th century.

707
01:55:35,030 --> 01:55:37,730
But they're deliciously beautiful, though, ain't they?

708
01:55:41,426 --> 01:55:43,526
What choice do we have, really?

709
01:55:44,604 --> 01:55:46,704
But, we're going to turn them, right?

710
01:55:48,953 --> 01:55:50,953
How romantic of you.

711
01:55:53,275 --> 01:55:55,275
I'll get the girl, though.

712
01:56:26,499 --> 01:56:28,499
Excuse moi?

713
01:56:31,802 --> 01:56:39,802


714
01:56:40,305 --> 01:56:46,811
