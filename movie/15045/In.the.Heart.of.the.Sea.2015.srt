1
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,820
人类如何了解未知
How does one come to know The Unknowable?

2
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,630
人类需要什么技能
What faculties must a man possess?

3
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,790
自从人类发现鲸油
Since it was discovered that whale oil

4
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,090
可以以前所未有的方式点亮我们的城市
could light our cities in ways never achieved before,

5
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,420
全世界需求量暴涨
it created global demand.

6
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:33,240
使人类向开始向
It had pushed man to venture further and further

7
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,010
海洋更深处冒险
into The Deep, Blue Unknown.

8
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,520
我们不知道海洋的深度
We know not its depths,

9
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,420
也不了解海洋里的生物
nor the host of creatures that live there.

10
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:45,070
怪物是否真的存在
Monsters, are they real?

11
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:00,010
或者这些故事只是让我们对海洋隐藏的秘密有所敬畏
Or do the stories exist only to make us respect the sea's dark secret?

12
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:11,010
楠塔基特岛 马萨诸塞州 1850年二月

13
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,740
这个问题使我即苦恼又兴奋
The question both vexes and excites me,

14
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,650
也是我再次向您写信请求一次会面的原因
and is the reason I've written you a second time to request a meeting.

15
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,020
一次和您交谈的机会 先生
A conversation with you, Sir,

16
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,440
我相信这会对我将要写的小说有很大帮助
I believe will serve me well for the novel I intend to write,

17
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,560
小说暂且名为 白鲸记
currently entitled Moby Dick

18
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,650
我期望您能考虑我的提议
I hope you will reconsider my offer.

19
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:37,710
未知 我的想象力始终想冒险的地方
The Unknown, that is where my imagination yearns to venture.

20
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,130
始终折磨我的问题是
And so, the question plagues me still:

21
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,850
人类如何才能探索未知
How does a man come to know The Unknowable?

22
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,780
此致 赫尔曼·梅尔维尔
Sincerely, Herman Melville.

23
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,400
我们打烊了
We're closed!

24
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,910
8点后不接客
No borders after eight o'clock.

25
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,940
你居然来了
You came.

26
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,400
亲爱的 有人来看你
There's someone here for you, My Love.

27
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,600
汤姆·尼克森
Tom Nickerson?

28
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,400
赫尔曼·梅尔维尔
Herman Melville.

29
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,770
我们收到了你的来信
We received your letter.

30
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,860
你要么走投无路要么是个傻子大老远跑来楠塔基特
You're either a desperate man or a fool to come all the way to Nantucket.

31
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:36,260
我的提议还在
Well, my offer still stands.

32
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,030
3个月的住宿换一晚的交谈
Three months'lodgings for a single night's talk.

33
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,420
这是我所有的钱了
It's all I have in the world.

34
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,120
但我更愿意看作是一次投资
But I'd prefer to think of it as an investment.

35
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,640
我想要你告诉我
I want you to tell me what happened...

36
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,440
埃塞克斯号发生了什么
to the Essex.

37
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,220
你觉得发生了什么
Well,what do you think happened?

38
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,230
有传言埃塞克斯号
There are rumblings,rumors that the Essex...

39
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,780
你想要什么 期望听到什么故事
What do you want?What story do you expect to hear?

40
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,960
白鲸的故事
That of The Whale.

41
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,110
埃塞克斯号搁浅了 有完整的报告
The Essex ran aground, there was a full inquiry.

42
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,730
我觉得那份报告不是事实全部
I believe the inquiry was less than truthful.

43
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:18,930
滚出去
Get out.

44
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,610
先生 你是埃塞克斯号上唯一的幸存者
You are the last survivor or the Essex, Sir.

45
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,910
如果你不说出来 谁还能讲出事实
If you won't talk, who will?

46
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:30,070
你没听见我的话吗 出去
You do not hear me, leave now.

47
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,030
你不能走 拜托 就一会儿  他没心情谈
- You mustn't go, please, just take a minute...    He's in no mind to talk, and

48
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,500
我不是大老远来就是为了被羞辱和浪费时间
I haven't come all this way to be humiliated and waste my time.

49
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,320
拜托了 梅尔维尔 先生
Please, Mr. Melville,

50
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,930
他从来不跟别人谈论埃塞克斯号 包括我 从不
he won't talk about the Essex to me, to anyone... never has... never.

51
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,900
我一点都不了解他
I don't know anything about him.

52
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:58,320
他的精神在受折磨 需要救赎
His soul is... in torment, and in need of confession.

53
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,650
拜托了 请让我和他谈 拜托了
Please, just let me talk to him... please.

54
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,240
亲爱的
Love,

55
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:17,420
我觉得和这个年轻人谈会对你有好处
I believe it would do you good to talk to the man.

56
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,340
不
No!

57
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,940
你听着
You listen well!

58
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,120
你酗酒要死的时候谁撑着这个家了
Who holds this place together while you drink yourself to death?

59
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,130
你必须和这个年轻人谈
You WILL talk with this man, as much as is necessary...

60
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,370
才能保住你的钱
to keep the money.

61
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,540
你知道我们的处境 汤姆
You know our circumstances, Tom.

62
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,320
我只说必要的
Only as much as is necessary.

63
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,990
我去拿威士忌
I'll get whiskey.

64
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:09,770
我忘了在信里提到我曾经是一名捕鲸手
I neglected to mention it in my letter, but I was a whaler once.

65
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,840
有过一次出航 新手
One trip. I mean... green hand.

66
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,600
那么你应该都经历过了
So, you've seen it all.

67
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,500
我妻子读过你的书
My wife read your books.

68
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:26,030
她很喜欢 很高兴听到
- She enjoyed them. - Happy to hear it.

69
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,470
销量很好 但我估计这个故事
They had good sales, but I think that THIS story

70
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:34,810
甚至能超过我销量不错的第一部小说
could surpass even the success of my first novel... which did quite well.

71
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:38,750
又一个你的航海轶事
Another of your seafaring yarns.

72
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,810
你听说过霍索恩吗 梅尔维尔先生
Have you read Hawthorne, Mr. Melville?

73
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:49,960
当下有一名作家 一个大作家
Now, there's a writer, a great writer.

74
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,620
他是的
He is.

75
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:57,200
但他不在这儿 因为我自己的原因
But he is not here, and I am...

76
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,030
我在这儿
for my own particular reasons.

77
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:12,810
我会告诉你埃塞克斯号 我相信你会失望的
I'll tell you of the Essex, I believe you will be disappointed,

78
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,810
但我说的每个字都是真实的
but every word I say will be true.

79
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,480
埃塞克斯号的故事就是两个男人的故事
The story of the Essex is the story of two men...

80
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,890
乔治·波拉德船长
Captain George Pollard,

81
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:29,560
和他大副 欧文·查斯
and his first mate, Owen Chase.

82
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,020
欧文 你不能迟到
Owen, you don't want to be late.

83
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:38,340
我会到那儿的 再说了 不能让我们的女儿睡在破陋的房子里对吧
I'll be there, besides, can't have our daughter sleeping under a leaky roof, can we?

84
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,640
你为什么那么肯定是女儿
What makes you so sure it's a girl?

85
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,860
肯定是的 她会提醒我你这么固执为什么我还是爱你
Well, it has to be, so she can remind me why I have to love you, and you being stubborn.

86
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,760
如果是女儿她会更像你而不是我
If it's to to be a daughter she'll be a version of you, not me.

87
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,390
金发而且一心想征服世界
Blond locks and determined to conquer the world.

88
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,090
我想过了今天你会用那件外套换一套制服
I suppose after today you'll be tradin' in that tunic for a uniform.

89
00:07:55,210 --> 00:08:00,550
没错 终于能离开这破地方去赚个区艾瑟 船长该住的房子了
That's right, finally out of this patch of dirt for a captain's house in Quaise.

90
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,720
我不想住在周边都是古板的邻居的房子里
I don't need one of those houses in town with stuffy neighbors.

91
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,860
这里有足够供我们一家三口居住的地方
There's plenty room here for the three of us.

92
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,780
有时候你的温情真让人受不了
Ya know, sometimes your kind heart and good nature is just unbearable.

93
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,280
去做你的船长吧
Go get your captaincy.

94
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,570
- 你下注 1美元9分
- What's your bid? - One ninety.

95
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,330
我用2美元买到了一千加仑
I've got a thousand gallons at two dollars!

96
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,810
我占40份
I'll take 40 shares.

97
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:08,070
卖家 卖家 在这
Seller, seller, over here!

98
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:15,950
克雷斯拉回来了1600桶
Criterion's back with a fine haul, 1600 barrels.

99
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:21,100
伦敦市场新纪录 50磅银器换灯芯
A new record, 50 pounds Sterling for headmatter on the London market.

100
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,730
早上好 查斯先生
Good morning Mr. Chase.

101
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,750
马森先生 请进
- Mr. Mason. - Come in, please.

102
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,160
我的合伙人 本杰明·福勒
My partner, Benjamin Fuller.

103
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,750
早上好 先生 请坐
- Good morning, Sir. - Do sit down.

104
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,270
查斯先生 我们希望你知道我们对你
Mr. Chase, I do hope you realize how satisfied we are

105
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,920
为我们多年的工作有多么满意
with the work you've done for us over the years.

106
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,040
谢谢 先生
Oh, thank you, Sir.

107
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,870
我们其中一艘船 埃塞克斯号
And one of our ships, the Essex

108
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:02,120
已经花大价钱修整好准备出海了
has just be refitted at great expense and is to go to sea.

109
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,870
因为在她身上花了大价钱
Now, having made such an investment in her,

110
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:08,350
我们希望确保她在最适合的人手里
we want to be sure she's in the best possible hands.

111
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,400
所以
So...

112
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:14,130
我们很高兴邀请你成为这艘船的
it gives us great pleasure to offer you a position aboard her...

113
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,570
大副
as first mate.

114
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,720
大副 是的
- As first mate? - Uh-hum.

115
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:26,030
马森先生 你许诺过我上次出航带回来1500桶的话
Mr. Mason, you... you promised me command of a ship after my last voyage when

116
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:30,820
会让我当一艘船的船长 你保证过的
I brought you back 1500 barrels, do you remember? You gave me your word.

117
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,600
那个承诺要推迟了
That promise must now be deferred.

118
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,070
像别人一样我们最近行情不好
Like everyone else we've had a mean time recently.

119
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,590
我看不是
Well, never on my watch.

120
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:43,530
楠塔基特主宰了全球市场 这点不能变
Nantucket now dominates the world market, that must not change.

121
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:46,680
没有时间来试验
This is no time for experimentation.

122
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,330
埃塞克斯号必须由乔治·波拉德指挥
The Essex will be captained by George Pollard,

123
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:53,420
伟大的捕鲸家族的后裔
scion of a great whaling family.

124
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,260
他的父亲也是我们的老主顾
His father also happens to be our patron.

125
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:01,650
血统 查斯先生 你可以有出色的航海技能
Blood, Mr. Chase, you can have all the voyages under your belt you want

126
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,700
但血统还是更重要
but blood will always win out.

127
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,660
但是血统不会帮你的船装满油回来 马森先生
Yes, well, blood's not gonna fill the ship with oil, Mr. Mason.

128
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:10,560
要成功指挥船 船长需要被人尊重 如果别人不尊重他怎么办
To successfully command, a captain needs respect, now, what if the men don't respect him?

129
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,210
你就要确保别人尊重他
You will make sure that they do.

130
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,180
再见 先生们
Good day, Gentlemen.

131
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,830
我理解你的失落
I understand your disappointment.

132
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,880
所以
So...

133
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:22,020
115金币
A one-fifteenth lay.

134
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,860
我从来没有给新长官支付过这么多
And that's more than I've ever paid any first officer.

135
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,600
如果你带回来2000桶油 我向你保证
And if you bring back 2000 barrels of oil, I'll give you my word,

136
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,320
下次你就会是船长
next time you WILL have your captaincy.

137
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,380
你之前给过我保证来 马森先生
You've given me your word before, Mr. Mason.

138
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:42,970
这次我需要书面保证
So, this time I'll take it in writing.

139
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:01,450
波拉德船长 我们和查斯先生达成了协议
Captain Pollard, we've just had a most agreeable conversation with Mr. Chase,

140
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,680
他会很荣幸服务于您
who'd be honored to serve under you.

141
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,280
我很高兴听到
I'm glad to hear it.

142
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,810
现在我得照顾个没经验的
Now I'm to babysit a greenhorn.

143
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:14,160
一个含着他妈的金勺长大的船长了
Some cheerless Nantucket born with a damned silver spoon in his mouth.

144
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,010
我真应该当面拒绝
I should have thrown their offer back in their faces.

145
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,980
为什么 你已经拿到书面承诺了
Why? You now have the offer of command in writing.

146
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,540
骗子的世界什么都是假的 即使是书面承诺
Yes, well, a liar's word is worthless, even ON paper.

147
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,760
你知道即使你是商人我还是会爱上你的
You know I'd love you just as much if you were a merchant captain?

148
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,790
你不能离开两年之久
And you wouldn't be gone for two years.

149
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,370
我不会离开两年之久的
I won't be gone two years.

150
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,450
贝德福德家的捕鲸人上周回来了 离开了有三年
A Bedford whaler came back last week was gone three.

151
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,690
她失去了两个男人 而且惊魂落魄
She lost two men and still with her hull half empty.

152
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,570
他们是贝德福德家 没有我在
Well, they were from Bedford and they didn't have me aboard.

153
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,260
婊子养的
Son of a bitch!

154
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,210
我要指挥我自己的船
I will captain my own ship...

155
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,830
一艘捕鲸船
a whaling ship.

156
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,060
靠他们我们只能永远在这个鬼地方
Up to them all we'd ever have is a patch of dirt

157
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,480
我不会让这发生的 佩吉
and that's not going to happen, Peggy.

158
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,930
你父亲也是这么说的 你不能这么说
Those'd be your father's words, not yours.

159
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,570
他的话怎么了
What's wrong with his words?

160
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:16,270
他想要为家人为自己争取
He wanted things for his family, for himself.

161
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,700
他是个梦想家 欧文 是的 他是
- He was a dreamer, Owen - Yes, he was.

162
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:23,620
梦想大海 不带那些废物们出海
Dreamed of the sea and never got to sea with men like them.

163
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,870
至少他看到了他的孩子出生
At least he got to see his children born.

164
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,550
我只能干这些
It's all I know.

165
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,990
对不起
I'm sorry.

166
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,900
我嫁给了一个捕鲸人
I married a whaleman.

167
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:59,270
我会尽快回来 我发誓
I'll come back as quick as the sun is night, I swear.

168
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:13,660
一定要回来 向我保证
Please come back... promise me.

169
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:18,780
我已经向你发誓了 你还要我保证
I already swore to you, now you want me to promise, too.

170
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,050
我保证
I promise.

171
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,200
孩子 跟你说句话
Son, a word with you.

172
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:47,830
当船长 你不能当他们的朋友 你是他们的长官
To be a captain, you cannot be a friend, you are their superior.

173
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,040
别忘了这点 让别人记住这点
Never forget that, never let THEM forget that.

174
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,280
谢谢
Thank you, son.

175
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,380
你的曾祖父和其他人创立了这个行业
Your great-grandfather and a few others created this industry.

176
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:01,950
没有我们 没有你们 世界将会陷入黑暗
Without us, without you, the world plunges into darkness.

177
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:05,160
我希望能让家族名誉生辉 先生
I hope to bring honor to the Pollard family name, Sir.

178
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:18,070
啊 上帝创造了巨大的鲸 体长无比的神奇怪物
Thou didst, O Lord, create the mighty whale, That wondrous monster of a mighty length;

179
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:22,300
头硕身庞尾又阔 无边雄力人难度
Beyond conception his unmeasured strength.

180
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:28,320
恒古上帝宥永生 吾侪荏弱落凡尘
But, everlasting God, thou dost ordain that we, poor feeble mortals

181
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:33,430
妻儿一家须偷生
should engage ourselves, our wives and children to maintain,

182
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,060
赖此巨物维生存
This dreadful monster with a martial rage.

183
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:46,290
啊 上帝 用您的荣耀之光照亮这些男人
O Father, grant that your glorious light shine on these men,

184
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,160
保佑他们丰收的航程
and assure them a prosperous voyage,

185
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:53,040
保佑他们安全归来
that they may return SAFELY unto the womb ship.

186
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:56,960
楠塔基特的白鲸油
So that the white whales of Nantucket whale oil

187
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,420
可以继续照亮我们的房屋
may continue to keep light in our homes,

188
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:07,080
照亮我们的街道 为工业机器提供燃料
city streets safe from sin in the night, fuel the machines of industry,

189
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,770
推动我们伟大的国家前进
drive our great nation forward,

190
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:16,370
我们文明种族进步 我们祈祷
as our noble species evolves. In Your name, we pray.

191
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:28,180
现在是几月
So, what month is this?

192
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,940
年末了 我们是最后一批出海的船只了
Oh, late in the year, we were one of the last ships to go out.

193
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:35,440
也是为什么我和我朋友巴尔齐莱有卧铺
Which is why my friend Barzillai and I got a berth.

194
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:40,580
听着 我当时14岁
Look, I was fourteen... fourteen.

195
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:44,350
尼克森 别站着 干活
Nickerson, you're standin' around, boy! Move!

196
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:48,000
第一次出海 很害怕 更害怕显露出来
First time at sea, scared, more scared to show it.

197
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,040
巴尔齐莱当时17岁
Barzillai was seventeen.

198
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,790
在码头长大的孤儿都等不及被别人视作大人
Orphans, grew up on the wharf, both in a hurry to be called men.

199
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,800
你们慢腾腾干嘛 装船 快 快
What are you all guys waiting for? Get it aboard! C'mon! Haul away...!

200
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,960
他们戴的是饰针是什么
What are those pins they're wearing?

201
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:04,320
那些是白鲸徽章 汤姆斯
Those are whale pins, Thomas.

202
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,200
我怎么才能得到一个
How do I get one of them?

203
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,980
你得用长矛刺杀一头白鲸
Well, you've gotta thrust a killing lance.

204
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,680
那是世界上最大的怪物
The largest beast ever to breathe on the earth.

205
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,500
尼克森 把那绿色的东西给邦德先生
Nickerson, get the green stuff to Mr. Bond.

206
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,110
快点 妈的
Make it quick, damn it.

207
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:21,630
我总有一天会有一堆那东西
I shall have twelve of those one day.

208
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,650
把它们放到匣子里
Put 'em on the Grandira casket.

209
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,450
你也上船就说明一件事
Well, well, you being on board means only one thing.

210
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,430
是啊 这船上至少有一人明白欧文·查斯是谁
Yep! At least there's one person on this ship who knows the truth about Owen Chase.

211
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:37,300
不 可惜其他的船都已经满员了
No, but all the other ships have already crewed up.

212
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,100
不不 我洗心革面了 欧文 问题是你呢
No, no, I'm a reformed man, Owen, the question is are YOU?

213
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,520
别告诉我花花公子马修戒酒了
Don't tell me Matthew Joy has put down the bottle.

214
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,130
我有罪 欧文·查斯能消消他的坏脾气了吗
I have sinned. Has Owen Chase put down his temper?

215
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,020
平静的像教堂
Serene as the Church.

216
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,260
照我看来
I'll believe THAT when I see it.

217
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:58,500
考虑到我们的船长 我觉得你只能平静一小会儿
Given our captain I'll give your serenity about 48 hours.

218
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,740
祝你好运
Good luck.

219
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:10,320
波拉德 乔治·波拉德 欧文·查斯
- Pollard, George Pollard. - Owen Chase.

220
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:15,080
查斯 你父亲的名字对吗 对 是的
- Chase, your father's name, isn't it? - Yes, it is.

221
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,900
马上他要离开岛一段时间而我舒适得待在家
Very shortly he will be off island for some time and I'll be very much at home.

222
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:26,290
我要说 我有点意外 通常船长可以选择自己的大副
I say, I was surprised, normally a captain gets to choose his first mate.

223
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,710
如果是有经验的船长的话 是的
An experienced captain, yes.

224
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,800
当人 你可以理解老头的意思
Of course, you can understand from the owners' point of view,

225
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,350
他们想让自己的财产在适合的人手里
they wanted to put their investments in the hands of men.

226
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:34,850
确实
Indeed.

227
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,890
他们也许想要多些保障
They probably wanted a little extra reassurance, that's all.

228
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:40,980
看着点我 如果我做错什么了告诉我
Well, DO keep an eye on me, let me know if I'm doing anything wrong.

229
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,310
我不会迟疑的 船长
I'd have it not other way, Captain.

230
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,290
起锚
Shore up the anchor.

231
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:58,530
起风了 顶部横杆放下了吗 好
- Head's in the wind, is the top rail off? - Aye.

232
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:59,940
克拉德 掌舵 好
- Collard, Take the helm! - Aye!

233
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,120
花花公子 扬帆
Mr. Joy, make sail.

234
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,800
科尔 查普尔 守在起锚器旁
Mr. Cole, Mr. Chappel, stand by this anchor!

235
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,760
查普尔 掌舵
Mr. Chappel, take the helm!

236
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:31,950
为什么帆布还没有松开
Boyd! Why aren't those braces laid out?

237
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,190
打开帆 妈的
Set the sail, god damn it!

238
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,990
跑开
Heading to scram.

239
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:00,060
船长 注意头上 后面 船长
- Captain! Heads up! - Behind you head, Captain!

240
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:06,380
怎么了 谢泼德 帆布缠住了 长官
- What happened, Mr. Sheppard? - The jalousie felled the sheet, Sir.

241
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,290
帆布缠住了 查斯 他办不到
- The jalousie's jammed! - Chase, she still won't clear!

242
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,790
当心
Watch your step!

243
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,100
帆布 欧文
It's the jalousie, Owen!

244
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,880
走开
Stand clear!

245
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:08,150
干的漂亮 查斯
Nice piece of work, Mr. Chase!

246
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,500
如果两周内能到佛得角
If we make Cape Verdes in the next 2 weeks we'll

247
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:25,860
我们有很大几率能按时到太平洋
have a decent chance of reaching the Pacific on schedule.

248
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,370
玉米棒 查斯
Corn, Mr. Chase?

249
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,670
不需要 谢谢 从来不喜欢
No, thank you, Sir, never did have much of a taste for it.

250
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:35,950
太怪了
That's odd.

251
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:40,460
你爸在科德角是种玉米的吧 是的
- So, your father grew corn on Cape Cod. - That's right, he did.

252
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,850
你也猜到了 我那时天天吃这个吃腻了
As you can imagine, I suddenly grew tired of eating it every day.

253
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:52,070
种玉米 秋葵 大豆 然后他进了监狱
Corn, okra, beans, I believe? Before he went to jail.

254
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:57,300
花花公子 听起来熟悉吗
Are you familiar with this story, Mr. Joy?

255
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:04,530
你知道查斯是因为他的父亲进监狱才变成孤儿的吗
Were you aware that Mr. Chase was effectively orphaned due to his father's incarceration?

256
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,070
我们都有不同的经历
Well, we all have our paths to sea.

257
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,660
所以还是不要问太多问题为好
That's a motive to not ask too many questions.

258
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:15,570
一定不容易吧
Can't have been easy though, yet...

259
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:20,000
楠塔基特最伟大的航海家族收留你
You had Nantucket's great seafaring family to adopt you.

260
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,740
很久没有楠塔基特人称呼我陆人
This is far from the first time I've been called a landsman...

261
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,910
或者提醒我不是他们一家人了
or off-islander by some Nantucket reminding me how I am NOT part of their family.

262
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:35,490
请允许我 船长 我要去分配捕鲸船和值班了
Now, if the captain will excuse me, there are whale boats and watches to assign.

263
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,180
不 船长 滴酒不沾
- No, Sir, not for me. - Not a drop?

264
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,940
不 船长 就像我说的 有时候少问问题更好
No, Sir, like I said, sometimes the fewer questions one asks, the better.

265
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,220
花花公子 这有个漂亮姑娘
That's a gorgeous girl, Mr. Joy.

266
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:16,090
远东的鲸骨上刻的
Region of move me that, carved from a Far East whalebone.

不许碰
No touching!

268
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:19,750
我一直以为你已经结婚了
I always thought you were married anyway.

269
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,110
是的 但看她
I am, and there she is.

270
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:25,020
这是她的鼻子
Well, that's her nose anyway.

271
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,680
恭喜 女士们
Congratulations, ladies.

272
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,630
今天启航干的不错
That was a fine job trimin' sails today.

273
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:36,590
我从来没有过这么一群捕鲸人
A sorrier pack of deck-whalers I don't think I've ever seen.

274
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,300
查普尔 长官

And Mr. Peterson, second mate's harpooner.

278
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,440
遵命 长官
Aye, Sir.

279
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:56,030
一船上六人 首要一点要警觉
There'll be six men to a boat, first rules in the row, six bells sharp.

280
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:59,160
我们还没到哈利法克斯以东 长官
We're not even east of Halifax, Sir.

281
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,270
你叫什么 克芬 亨利·克芬
- What's your name? - Coffin, Henry Coffin.

282
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,540
他是船长的表弟 长官
He's the Captain's cousin, Sir.

283
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:11,680
克芬先生 你觉得一头白鲸会知道自己在哈利法克斯以东吗
Well, well, Mr. Coffin, do you think a whale knows it's east of Halifax?

284
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,420
我不知道你们原来是谁 或者怎么来的
I don't know who all of you are, or how you got here,

285
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,600
你们中一些人可能甚至是重犯 在隐藏或者逃亡
Some of you probably have felonies, or are hidin' or on the run.

286
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:26,740
没关系 我不关心 我对你们的要求只有一个
That's fine, I don't give a damn, but we interred you for just one thing...

287
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:31,400
只有一个 就是鲸油
and one thing only, and that is whale oil.

288
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,510
我要装满2000桶油并尽快回家
I intend to fill our 2000 barrels and be home as quickly as possible.

289
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,310
即使天气好而且没有鲸出没 克芬先生
And even when the weather is fine and there ARE no whales, Mr. Coffin,

290
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,020
我们会放下船练习如何捕鲸
we will lower the boats and practice all maneuvers necessary in a capture of a whale.

291
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,480
谁要是想偷懒就自己游回家 明白吗
And any man who is idle will find himself swimmin' to home. Is that understood?

292
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,870
明白 长官
- Aye, sir. Aye, Sir. - Aye, Sir.

293

小子 上甲板

294
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,760

297
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,530
有些人一开始会觉得恶心
Ya know, some feel sick at first.

298
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,870
拉我上去 这是最好的办法
- Pull me back up! - Best way to square up to King Neptune, Boy.

299
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,550
求你了 拉我上去
Please, bring me up.

300
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:26,830
好点了吗
Better now?

301
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,420
长官 非常对不起
Sir, I am so sorry.

302
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,730
你现在有故事写信回家告诉你母亲了
Well, now you got something to write home to your mother about.

303
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:44,920
我母亲葬在史密斯山
My mother's buried up in Smith's Hill,

304
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,500
我爸也是 他
and a stone for my father, too, he was...

305
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,450
他在我出生前就葬身大海了
he was lost at sea before I was born.

306
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:53,140
给我
Here, give me that.

307
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,570
白鲸现在是你的家人了 是好是坏
The whale's is your family now, Boy, for better or for worse.

308
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,560
坏处多是
For worse mostly.

309
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,990
清理甲板 小子
Swab the deck, Kid!

310
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,140
你离学会捕鲸和航行还差远了
You're a long way from base to be whaling and sailing.

311
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:27,820
是 长官
Aye, aye, Captain.

312
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,670
你系错绳子了 是 长官
- You got that line wrong, Nickerson. - Aye, Captain.

313
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,080
如果有必要我们会训练到日落
We'll stay at this until sunlight if we have to.

314
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,360
是 长官
Aye, Captain.

315
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,880
鱼叉手准备乘船
Harpooners make ready to boat.

316
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,760
雷 动作快点 我的错
- Need to move quicker, Mr. Ray! - My mistake.

317
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:59,070
没有女人玩了 查斯
Ain't no more wee whores, Mr. Chase.

318
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,900
你现在是水手了 哈哈
You're a sailor, now! Yeah!.

319
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:07,160
干的不错 雷
Not bad, Mr. Ray, well done!

320
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:11,280
要习惯 伙计们 你们得像马一样工作
Get used to it, mates, you gotta work like horses.

321
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,830
查斯先生 长官
- Mr. Chase. - Sir.

322
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,610
扬帆
Set stuns'ls.

323
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:18,810
这样做好吗 长官 我们接近洋流
Is that wise, Sir, we're near the Gulf Stream.

324
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,210
看这天气也还得缓慢前进
Best to be five knots fto even see the weather.

325
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,300
我们落后两天行程了
We are two days behind.

326
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,800
你得在东风来临前弥补上时间
You need to make up the time before we catch the east wind.

327
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:29,260
扬帆
Set stuns'ls.

328
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:36,170
扬帆
Set stuns'ls.

329
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:39,080
拴绳 扬帆
Belay that, set stuns'ls.

330
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,290
克芬 松开帆 船长要提速
Get her off, Mr. Coffin, the Captain wants speed!

331
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,340
遵命 长官
Aye, Sir.

332
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,590
她老了 但是还能让我们爽 哈哈
She might be old but she can still blow, boys!

333
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,910
长官 右舷方向有一飓风团 我们需要马上降帆
Sir, a squall on the starboard route, we need to shorten the sail immediately.

334
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:44,230
还不行 查斯
Not just yet, Mr. Chase.

335
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:46,630
长官 我们以8里的速度驶向风暴
Sir, we are headed into a storm of more than 8 knots

336
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:47,850
而且速度越来越快
and it's movin' faster than that.

337
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:50,540
让它来吧 水手们在陆地上呆久变软弱了
Let it come, the men are soft from months on land, they

338
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:54,090
他们需要一次洗礼 告诉他们工作开始了
need a good baptism, let them know our work has begun.

339
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,750
如果我们不降帆并驶离 风暴一定会追上我们的
If we don't shorten sail and bear off it'll catch us on the beam.

340
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:02,920
查斯 我们继续向前航行
Chase, we will stand on.

341
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:07,270
劳伦斯 继续向前 继续向前 长官
- Mr. Lawrence, hold our course. - Holding course, Sir.

342
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:09,270
我们这样前行会追到只差半天的航程
We'll lose half a day running like that.

343
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:11,440
我们最后能赶上 如果我们的人
We'll scut the end of it, if the men can't

344
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:14,340
不能应付这样的狂风 上帝也帮不了我们
handle a gust like this, then God help us all.

345
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,070
固定好一切应付糟糕的天气
Best secure for heavy weather.

346
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:49,040
准备好应付天气 邦德 我们要驶向风暴了
Best prepare for weather, Mr. Bond, we're headed into a squall.

347
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:12,250
我们必须降帆离开这里 退下 查斯先生
- We must fall off and run with it. - Stand down, Mr. Chase.

348
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:16,700
劳伦斯 航向不变 航向不变 长官
- Mr. Lawrence, hold your course. - Holding course, Sir.

349
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:34,400
降帆 查斯
Shorten the sails, Mr. Chase.

350
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,970
我们要砍下那些帆
We need to cut those sails down!

351
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,710
船掉头 向陆地开
Turn the ship, head for land!

352
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,900
不 损坏已经造成了
No, the damage is done!

353
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,790
太晚了 太他妈晚了
It's too late, it's too god damned late!

354
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:14,020
我们会撞上的
We'll be broadsided!

355
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:34,690
抓牢
Hold on!

356
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,280
小心
Look out!

357
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,160
花花公子
Mr. Joy!

358
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,420
我们要割断 我知道了 欧文
- We have to cut away the... - I've got it, Owen!

359
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:33,340
我们要让船摆正
We have to set her up right!

360
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,830
你说要见我 长官
You wish to see me, Sir.

361
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:34,550
明天六时 你召集船员
At six bells tomorrow, you will assemble the crew,

362
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:38,850
告知他们我们将返回楠塔基特维修
inform them that we will be returning to Nantucket for repairs.

363
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:42,160
然后你向他们道歉你干涉了船长的命令
You will then apologize to them for interfering with a captain's order

364
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:45,870
今天差点让船上的每个人都为此丧命
which nearly cost the lives of every man on this ship today.

365
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:46,620
什么
What?

366
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:49,480
返回到港口我会接受你的辞呈
I'll accept your resignation upon our return to port.

367
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,080
就这些
That will be all.

368
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,930
是你下命令杨帆的 长官
It was your order to set stuns'ls, Sir.

369
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:55,850
命令没问题 这些人需要锻炼
That decision was sound, the men needed testing.

370
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,980
你送他们进风暴
- You sent 'em into a storm? - That...

371
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,700
那是幸运不好
was unlucky.

372
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:03,840
不 这是缺乏航海经验 责怪运气只会显得软弱
No, it was bad seamanship, and blaming misfortune is just plain weakness.

373
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:07,940
你他妈的无礼 你知道你在和谁说话吗
Damn your impertinence! Do you know who you're speaking to?

374
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:12,280
我是船长乔治·波拉德 波拉德
My name is CAPTAIN George Pollard. POLLARD!

375
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:19,470
而你查斯先生 无论你衣袖上钉多少白鲸徽章
And you Mr. Chase, no matter how many whale pins you may have on your lapel,

376
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:21,800
你不过是个农民的儿子
are nothing more than the son of a farmer,

377
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:25,110
仗势欺人才当上的长官
who's managed to bullying his way into an officer's tunic.

378
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,310
滚出去
Now, get out!

379
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:35,470
不带一桶油回港口是个错误 长官
To return to port without a single barrel of oil would be a mistake, Sir.

380
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:41,090
和名字是波拉德或者查斯没什么关系
And not behoove a man whose name is Pollard... or Chase, for that matter.

381
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:45,560
对我们来说最好是抓紧时间工作
And the best thing for both of us would be t'work all hours God sends us.

382
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,760
把船装满油一年之内回到家
Fill this ship with oil, and be home inside a year

383
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:51,500
然后各自分道扬镳
and rid of one another as quickly as possible.

384
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,570
相信我 我也迫不及待这样做
Trust me, I have never been as desirous of that as you.

385
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:03,520
当然 这由船长来做决定
Of course, that is the Captain's decision.

386
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,870
他们像一对新婚夫妇
They were like a new married couple.

387
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:21,520
新婚夫妇能容忍对方 梅尔维尔先生
A new married couple tolerate each other, Mr. Melville,

388
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:24,440
但新婚夫妇也能两败俱伤
but a new married couple can also bring down a ship.

389
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:28,050
你结婚了吗 梅尔维尔先生 是的
- You married, Mr. Melville? - I am.

390
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,270
上帝仁慈
The Lord have mercy on ya.

391
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,510
第一个孩子也快生了
First child on the way, too.

392
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,660
那你的妻子知道你把所有的积蓄都带来了
So, does your good wife know that you brought all you have in the world here tonight,

393
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,830
并且给了一个陌生人吗
and givin' it to a stranger?

394
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,700
不知道 先生 你总让人吃惊
- No, Sir. - You're full of surprises, aren't you?

395
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:49,640
那么 埃塞克斯号没有回港口
So... the Essex did not return to port.

396
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,800
没有 她继续驶向大海
- She did not. - She continued out to sea.

397
00:35:52,860 --> 00:36:00,230
是的 但不久 我们都听到这个捕鲸人都盼望听到的吼声
Yes, she did, but before long, we heard the call this all whale men pray for...

398
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,600
Ho!

399
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:05,530
喷水
Blows!

400
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:09,060
是大家伙 喷水了
A big one! Thar she blows!

401
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:14,080
公的母的 拉姆斯德尔先生  他们是公的
- White or sperm, Mr. Ramsdell? - Sperm whales they are!

402
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:18,310
查斯先生  升起船只
Mr. Chase, hoist and swing boat.

403
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:22,710
都来甲板
- All Hands! All hands on deck! - All hands on deck!

404
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,990
放船
Lower away!

405
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:39,990
出海三个月 南大西洋

406
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:17,620
再加把劲儿
Come on, put your back into it.!

407
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,170
幼年鲸
There's the calf.

408
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,600
幼年鲸 母鲸
- That's the calf? - That's the cow!

409
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,860
乖乖 那是我们的钱
That's our boy! That's the money!

410
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,100
尼克森 使劲
Nickerson! Push!

411
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,970
够四十桶油了吧 五十桶
- Forty barrels there? - Fifty!

412
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,950
天 他是个大家伙
Boy, he's a buster!

413
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:01,420
使劲划 要不然他要逃了
Take the oars, lads! Quick or he'll god damn run!

414
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:05,410
划起来 机灵点 伙计们 机灵点
Pull those oars up! Smartly, lads, smartly!

415
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,710
小心桨端
Mind your oars!

416
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,560
拉姆斯德尔 准备绳 是 长官
- Mr. Ramsdell, prepare the line. - Aye, Sir.

417
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,820
第一头是我的
The first one's mine.

418
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,090
瞄准她的弱点
Aim her to the free spot!

419
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,920
拉 拉 跟着
Pull! Pull! Stay on him.

420
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:45,360
伙计们 你们坐上了楠塔基特号第一班雪橇
You're on your first Nantucket sleigh ride, Boys.

421
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:02,430
地球上最可怕的生物
The most fearsome creature to ever live on this earth.

422
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:18,180
我的手
My hand!

423
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:28,200
你得把绳弄湿 尼克森
You need to wet the line, Nickerson.

424
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:43,730
只剩140英寻的绳子了 查斯先生
A hundred forty fathoms' of line left, Mr. Chase.

425
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,790
只剩80英寻的绳子了 长官
Eighty fathoms' of line left, Sir.

426
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,760
他会把我们拖到水里的
He's gonna pull us under!

427
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:06,120
马修 我要你的绳子 给我绳
- Matthew, I need your line! - Feed the line!

428
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,610
彼得森给我绳子 是的 长官
- Peterson give me the line! - Aye, Sir.

429
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:13,460
把那绳给我 彼得森 我们只剩60英寻的绳子了 长官
- Give me that line, Mr. Peterson. - We're down to 60 fathoms' of line left, Sir.

430
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:18,140
20英寻了 查斯先生 松开绳
- Twenty fathoms, Mr. Chase! - Tie it off!

431
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:24,140
快
Go!

432
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:39,000
彼得森 你来 是 长官
- Peterson, lay on! - Aye, Sir.

433
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,220
还剩多长的绳子
How many fathoms can he draw?

434
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:48,700
不 不 等等
No, no, no, wait!

435
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:55,340
欧文 不 不是现在
- Owen! - Oh, no, not yet!

436
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,330
别碰那绳 只剩50英寻了 长官
- Don't touch that line. - Down to 50 fathoms, Sir.

437
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,450
欧文 他妈的 我说了不要动
- Owen! God damn it! - I said don't touch it!

438
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,500
剩30英寻了 花花公子
Thirty fathoms left, Mr. Joy.

439
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:12,680
剩10英寻了 长官
Ten fathoms left, Sir!

440
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:38,320
真是漫长的过程
It's been a long drive.

441
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,320
油中的脂肪
Blubber in the oil.

442
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,130
它们要吃掉你的钱了
They're gonna eat your money.

443
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:02,600
滚开 混账畜生
Get out of there, you sons of bitches!

444
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:08,420
- 你拿到了吗 拿到了 查斯
- You got it? - Got it, Chase.

445
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,850
看起来怎么样 不怎么样
- How's it lookin'? - Not good.

446
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:17,730
就这么多了
That's it.

447
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:23,880
查斯先生 什么
- Mr. Chase, Sir? - Yep.

448
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:26,310
长官 就这么多了 我们拿不到更多了
That's all of it, Sir, we can't get anymore out.

449
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:29,120
那就是金矿 伙计们 继续挖
That's the gold in there, Boys, c'mon, keep diggin'.

450
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:33,250
我块头太大下不去 得找个身材小的
- I'm too big to really go down there. - Then find someone who can.

451
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:40,920
尼克森 过来小子
Nickerson, come here boy!

452
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:45,160
嘿 我喊你过来
Hey! I said c'mere!

453
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,030
爬进去
Climb on in with 'im.

454
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,210
来啊 汤姆斯
Come on, Thomas.

455
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:56,260
这里面的东西可比它的肉值钱多了
What's in there is worth a HELLEVA lot more than what they're boilin' down.

456
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,160
长官 我不行 对不起 我做不了
Sir, I can't, I'm sorry. I can't.

457
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,700
你自己进去或者我让你睡在里面
You get down there, or I'll have you sleep down there.

458
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,450
你用牙齿把这东西咬住 小子
You best put that between your teeth, Boy.

459
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,320
它里面臭得很
It tastes worse than the Devil's asshole down there.

460
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:22,050
谢谢
Thank you.

461
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:31,260
抱歉 尼克森 我的枕头送你
- Sorry. - Here, Nickerson, take my pillow with ya!

462
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,440
下去
Down ya go.

463
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:54,080
一个人在里面能更了解自己
A man gets to know himself down there.

464
00:44:56,490 --> 00:45:01,220
他们有送你进一头鲸的头里面吗 没有 他们饶了我
- Did they ever send you into a whale's head? - No, I was spared.

465
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:04,890
那里面才是宝藏所在
Well, that's where the treasure is.

466
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,910
我永远都不会忘记那第一头
I'll never forget that first bull.

467
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:15,200
47桶油 当然 幸福很短暂
Forty-seven barrels... of course, the happiness was short lived.

468
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:17,690
那片水域没有鲸鱼可捕了
The waters had all been fished out?

469
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:23,440
是的 所以我们向更远处前进
That they had. So, we headed further out.

470
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,060
在那一个月之后
It was a month around the Horn.

471
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:34,170
离开了南大西洋
Left the South Atlantic behind with a sliver of hope

472
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:36,600
期望情况会变好
that things would change for the better.

473
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:41,470
但到了太平洋事实上没有改善
But making the Pacific didn't improve our lot.

474
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:46,860
太他妈难看到鲸了
Whale sightings were TOO damn scarce.

475
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:52,390
将近一年后脾气冲动的船长
After nearly a year at sea the temperaments of our captain.

476
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:55,050
和大副都变的沮丧
And our first mate grew more strained.

477
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:00,680
船长波拉德几乎整天待在船舱里
Captain Pollard spent most days and nights in his cabin,

478
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:03,230
害怕看到船员无法交代
afraid to look his crew in the eye.

479
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,820
我们的仓储大半还空着
Our hold was almost empty.

480
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:17,110
凝视着我们皮毛的成果只会提醒我们
To gaze upon our paltry efforts only served as a reminder

481
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:20,230
离回家还有很长一段路
that we were a long way from going home.

482
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:36,230
阿塔卡梅斯 厄瓜多尔

483
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:47,000
我听不懂 说英语
I don't talk that talk. Speak English?

484
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,990
他们在说鲸油
They're talking whale oil.

485
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:16,990
牧师坚持要我们写信回家告知我们的情况

486
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:17,990
他觉得这些信帮得了谁

487
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,000
那些寡妇

488
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:21,700
船都没有的船主

489
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:25,500
你还要像这样生活多久 船长

490
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,500
写信给西班牙 为你和你的船长 祈求原谅

491
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:37,000
没人可以阻止发生的一切

492
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:41,000
谁会相信呢 没有人 顾主不会相信的

493
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:46,000
这么多年你用油换来钱装满他们的口袋

494
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:49,870
长官
Capitбn.

495
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:53,780
打扰了 当地人告诉我你的航程遇到阻碍了 长官
Excuse me, the locals told me that your voyage was waylaid, Sir.

496
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,680
埃塞克斯号船长 乔治·波拉德
Captain George Pollard, the Essex.

497
00:47:56,930 --> 00:48:00,360
圣玛丽亚号船长 克莱门特佩莱斯
Capitбn Clemente Pelaez, the Santa Maria.

498
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:03,470
给大伙来一杯
Would you buy a colleague a drink?

499
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:06,700
老样子 乔治 是的 船长
- Same as always, George. - Yes, Captain

500
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:13,570
坏运气
Bad luck, huh?

501
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:15,930
那有多远
How far out?

502
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,650
远到只有傻子才会去
Far enough for only a fool to go.

503
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,380
那是多远
How far would that be?

504
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:24,420
一千里格 在赤道附近
A thousand leagues along the Equator...

505
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,860
近海区域
in offshore grounds.

506
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:29,220
鲸都在那儿
Were there whales there?

507
00:48:30,330 --> 00:48:32,020
多到你做梦不敢想
More than you've ever dreamt.

508
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:36,920
成百上千 密密麻麻望不到边
Hundreds... fields of flukes as far as the eye can see.

509
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:40,490
他们原本一天就够装满3000桶油
They could fill up 3000 barrels in the space of a day.

510
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:42,440
什么意思 "原本"
What do you mean, "Could have"?

511
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:49,220
要不是那里的那头怪物
If it weren't for that demon...

512
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:52,400
一头鲸
a whale.

513
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:55,110
白如蜡石
White as alabaster,

514
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:56,980
一百英尺长
a hundred feet long,

515
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:00,950
我的六名船员因为它丧命
sent six of my crew to their graves,

516
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,570
剩下的我们 只会让人想起那头怪物
and the rest of us, something to remember him by.

517
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:18,550
那头白鲸 他跳舞给你看 还逗你玩吗
Now, this white whale, did he dance a jig and pick your pocket, as well?

518
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,050
谢谢
Thank you.

519
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,620
你相信他的鬼话
Do you believe that?

520
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,800
我们马上出发 赶上南风带
We set sail now, catch the south easterlies,

521
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:39,850
这是我们绝佳的机会 填饱肚子 我们有机会在半年内回家
this is by our best time, fill our belly, we can be home in six months.

522
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:42,800
你怎么看 查斯先生
What say you, Mr. Chase?

523
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:46,500
没必要再忍受这种困境了
No need to endure our predicament for a moment longer than necessary.

524
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:47,760
同意
Amen to that.

525
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:50,270
同意
Amen.

526
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:54,810
贪婪影响了船长和大副
Greed took hold of our Captain and the first mate.

527
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:59,620
然后我们沿着赤道前往一千里格外的
So, we headed out... a thousand leagues along the Equator...

528
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:04,530
但是没想到 传言流开了
but with no agenda, speculation began.

529
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:07,190
说鲸都藏在那里
This is where the whales are gonna hide.

530
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:10,830
那是我们能到达的最远的地方
It was as far from land as we could possibly go.

531
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:13,320
但是我们要追捕他们
But we hunted them down.

532
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:18,790
几个世纪前 水手们害怕会航到地球边界
Centuries before, sailors feared sailing off the edge of the earth,

533
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:23,290
但我们是驶向理智的边缘
but we were headed for the edge of sanity.

534
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:29,950
信任给猜疑让位
Trust gave way to doubt...

535
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:33,450
期望消除迷信
hope to blind superstition.

536
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,020
船长 船员在议论
Cap'n, the men are talking.

537
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,410
这很正常
That's what men do.

538
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:41,230
他们对你航行这么远的决定不满
They aren't happy with your decision to sail out this far.

539
00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:43,390
你纠正他们的观点了吗
Well, did you correct them?

540
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:47,030
你提醒他们我们的目标是用鲸油装满这艘船
Did you remind them of our purpose to fill this ship with whale oil

541
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:50,170
如果那里有成百上千头鲸 为什么不去呢
and if the whales ARE a thousand leagues out, then that is where we go?

542
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:56,810
表哥 拜托了 这太疯狂了
Cousin, please, this is madness.

543
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:01,200
你被那人影响了
You have let yourself be influenced by that man.

544
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:02,800
你必须把船调头
You must turn this ship back.

545
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:09,680
我建议你回去 消除他们的疑虑
I suggest you go back down, reassure the men, the leader,

546
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:14,540
以后别再仗着家庭身份来找我
and don't ever, ever abuse the privilege of family with me again...

547
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:18,050
克芬先生
Mr. Coffin.

548
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:31,050
出海第十四个月

549
00:51:48,330 --> 00:51:49,440
怎么了
What is it?

550
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,080
听 查斯先生
- Listen... - Mr. Chase.

551
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:54,040
我看到些白柱 哪里
- I see some white water. - Where?

552
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:55,490
左舷
Port side!

553
00:51:58,190 --> 00:51:59,190
你看到什么了吗
You see anything?

554
00:52:06,110 --> 00:52:09,310
出船 出船
- Lower away! - Lower away!

555
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:14,050
那头挂物要完蛋了
The Devil'll take the Mexican ground.

556
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,750
用力刺他 刺他
Stick him hard! Stick him!

557
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:07,210
一直向前 彼得森
Straight ahead, Peterson.

558
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:20,400
别人他咬了船桨 伙计们
Don't let him chew the oars, Boys.

559
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:22,160
看着点
Back to it!

560
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:48,640
那头鲸 是的
- The whale? - Yes.

561
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:51,080
传言是真的 是的
- So, it's true. - Yes.

562
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:53,870
可惜是真的
Too much is true.

563
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:13,380
全速
Full pressure!

564
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:31,550
邦德先生 后退4码 载具放下来
Mr. Bond, back to 4 yards, lower the tackle!

565
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
遵命 长官
Aye, Sir.

566
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,050
劳伦斯先生 驶向下风口的鲸群
Mr. Lawrence, take us leeward headed straight for the school.

567
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:53,910
马上 长官
Right, Sir.

568
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,200
热焦油 长官 我们会找到他的
- Hot tar, Sir. - We'll find him.

569
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:03,210
我们接近背部了
We're close to black skin.

570
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:05,120
靠近她
Sneak up on her!

571
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:16,350
她是我们的了
She's ours, Lads.

572
00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:50,180
那是什么 劳伦斯先生
What was that, Mr. Lawrence?

573
00:55:54,290 --> 00:55:55,740
查斯先生
Mr. Chase.

574
00:56:03,930 --> 00:56:05,690
妈的
God damn it.

575
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,200
找劳伦斯过来
Find Mr. Lawrence...

576
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:52,380
找劳伦斯去抽水
Get Mr. Lawrence to man the pumps!

577
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:54,790
他在哪儿
Where is he?

578
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:56,740
左舷船头
Port bow!

579
00:57:08,330 --> 00:57:10,440
给我最大的鱼叉
Get me the biggest tines we have.

580
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,780
他想来一战
He wants a fight.

581
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,120
我从来没过鲸这么做 劳伦斯 掌舵
- I never seen a whale do that. - Mr. Lawrence, take the wheel.

582
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:31,350
拉姆斯德尔 把绳子另一头系在前桅
Mr. Ramsdell, secure the other end of the line to the foremast.

583
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:32,300
遵命 长官
Aye, Sir.

584
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:35,680
只要我还活着 他是我的
As I live and breathe, he's mine.

585
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:23,440
当心
Look out!

586
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:17,760
船长
Cap'n...

587
00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:20,840
埃塞克斯号 它在倾斜
The Essex, it's listing.

588
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:34,190
帮我调头
Help me turn around.

589
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:14,990
勇敢点 在这 过来 尼克森
- That's it, be brave. - Here! Full ahead, Mr. Nickerson.

590
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:53,140
查斯先生
Mr. Chase.

591
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:58,470
一头鲸撞坏了船
A whale threw her, it stove the ship.

592
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:00,180
什么
What?

593
01:01:00,310 --> 01:01:02,570
我们失去了伊斯顿和山本
We lost Easton and Sanborn.

水泵没用了 长官
The pumps are useless, Sir.

595
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:17,890
准备弃船 我们不能划着回去
- Prepare to abandon ship. - We can't row away home!

596
01:01:18,410 --> 01:01:21,040
我们必须从船上带走必要的东西
We have to strip from the sails and jimmy-rig something.

597
01:01:21,090 --> 01:01:21,760

Clear and loaded, Mr. Joy.

624
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:26,740

Back away, or she'll take us down with her.

625

629
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:30,940

It's he!

631

632
01:08:00,550 --> 01:08:03,110
你骗不了我 查斯先生
You don't fool me, Mr. Chase.

633
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:05,660
克芬先生 是吗
- Mr. Coffin. - That right?

634
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:09,120
你带我们来这的 你知道的
You put us here, you know you put us here.

635
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:12,790
嘿 放下枪 放下手枪

636
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:13,760
告诉我你害怕了
Say you're scared!

637
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:15,620
克芬先生 放下枪
Mr. Coffin, put the pistol down!

638
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:16,670
你清楚食物和水耗尽后会怎样
You know what happens when the food and water runs out!

639
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:20,100
按船长说的做 克芬先生
Do as the Captain says, Coffin!

640
01:08:20,150 --> 01:08:20,790
我只是想看到
I just want to see

641
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:22,900
陆人害怕 克芬 放下枪
- the landsman scared. - Coffin, put the pistol down!

642
01:08:22,950 --> 01:08:25,320
这是命令 按照船长说的做
- That's an order! - Do as the Captain says! Now!

643
01:08:25,370 --> 01:08:26,930
说啊 亨利
- Say it! - Henry.

644
01:08:26,990 --> 01:08:29,280
说啊 说啊
Say it! Say it!

645
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:32,860
亨利 放下枪
Henry! Put the pistol down.

646
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:40,900
亨利 放下枪
Henry, put it down.

647
01:09:17,230 --> 01:09:18,970
然后向东
So, east it was,

648
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:22,120
按来的路线回去
back in the direction we'd come,

649
01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:24,890
顶着烈日靠着一个指南针
With only the sun and a compass.

650
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:29,090
所有的方向都看起来一样
All directions looked the same.

651
01:09:29,810 --> 01:09:33,180
我们的期望是靠着西风带漂到复活岛
Our hope was to catch the westerlies to Easter Island,

652
01:09:34,050 --> 01:09:36,790
3000英里的距离
a journey of 3,000 miles.

653
01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:39,810
过了12天我们漂到了南方
For 12 days we've drifted south.

654
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:42,080
6度纬度
Six degrees latitude.

655
01:09:42,590 --> 01:09:45,540
离复活岛差了十万八千里
Not one mile closer to Easter Island.

656
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:52,510
我们被诅咒了
We are cursed.

657
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:55,640
当我们赶上风带我们会弥补上的
We'll make up for it when we catch the variables.

658
01:09:58,620 --> 01:10:00,150
我们会赶上的
We'll catch 'em.

659
01:10:35,290 --> 01:10:36,440
抓牢了 船长
Hold on, Captain!

660
01:10:42,170 --> 01:10:44,560
花花公子 帆绳缠住了
Mr. Joy, the halyard's jammed.

661
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:51,290
花花公子 抓住它 花花公子
Mr. Joy! Grab at it, Mr. Joy!

662
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:59,700
马修
Matthew!

663
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,470
马修 发生了什么 发生了什么
Matthew, okay, what happened? What happened?

664
01:11:37,370 --> 01:11:39,540
你在这干什么 让我看看
- What are you doing here? - Let me take a look.

665
01:11:39,590 --> 01:11:41,720
不 不 不 让我看看
- No, no, no. - Let me take a look.

666
01:11:41,770 --> 01:11:42,780
我没事 我没事
I'm fine, I'm fine.

667
01:11:42,830 --> 01:11:45,550
放松 我知道 让我看一眼
Just relax, I know, I know, let me take a look.

668
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:53,740
我被击中头部了 我没事 好吗
I'm hit on the head, it's good, right?

669
01:11:53,790 --> 01:11:56,050
给他些水 我不需要什么水
- Give him some water! - I don't need any water!

670
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:57,990
给他他妈的一些水喝
Give him some God damned water.

671
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:00,610
不 不 我不需要水 我没事
No, no, no, I don't need water, I'm fine.

672
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:10,260
拿着
Take that, take it!

673
01:12:11,770 --> 01:12:13,310
没事
I gotcha, I gotcha!

674
01:12:13,410 --> 01:12:16,120
没事的 你会没事的
All right, you'll be all right.

675
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:22,900
嘿 你们在看什么 我没事
Hey, what are you all looking at, I'm fine.

676
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:25,420
波拉德船长 我装的
Cap'n Pollard, this is fiddle.

677
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:28,540
我忽悠你们的 听见了吗
This is God damn fiddle, ya hear me?

678
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:30,470
欧文 在
- Owen. - Yeah.

679
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:33,520
我没事 我没事
I'm fine, all right, I'm fine.

680
01:12:33,910 --> 01:12:37,450
我没事 离开这
- Thank you. - I'm fine! Get out of here!

681
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:39,740
他没事
He is good.

682
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:41,920
我们走
Let's go.

683
01:12:43,490 --> 01:12:46,560
为什么在死人身上浪费水
Why waste water on a dead man?

684
01:12:46,610 --> 01:12:51,750
他们从小一起航海 情同手足
Fancy men who know each other, sailed together since childhood.

685
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,180
你告诉我
Now, tell me,

686
01:12:53,230 --> 01:12:56,040
你会坐等着看你的兄弟死去吗
could you just sit there and watch your own brother die?

687
01:12:57,130 --> 01:13:00,080
简单的算术问题 查普尔先生
It's simply a matter of numbers, Mr. Chappel.

688
01:13:00,790 --> 01:13:02,610
水不够我们所有人用
There's not enough for all of us.

689
01:13:14,690 --> 01:13:17,070
为什么在死人身上浪费水
Why waste water on a dead man?

690
01:13:18,340 --> 01:13:19,780
为什么浪费水
Why waste water...

691
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:22,220
为什么浪费水
Why waste water?

692
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:25,760
为什么在死人身上浪费水
Why waste water on a dead man?

693
01:13:26,630 --> 01:13:27,840
尼克森先生
Mr. Nickerson?

694
01:13:29,230 --> 01:13:31,240
为什么在死人身上浪费水 你还好吗 先生
- Why waste water on a dead man? - Are you all right, Sir.

695
01:13:32,020 --> 01:13:34,520
我不能 不能什么
- I cannot. - Cannot what?

696
01:13:34,570 --> 01:13:38,770
不 你 你 你知道足够多了 你了解够多了
No, you... you... you have enough, you have more than enough.

697
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:40,260
但是 先生 我们都讲到这儿了
But, Sir! We've come so far.

698
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:43,640
我们必须善始善终 我们有约定的 先生
- We have come to an end. - We have an agreement, Sir.

699
01:13:43,690 --> 01:13:46,830
拿着钱离开 这是魔鬼的交易
Take the money and leave! You've a devil's bargain!

700
01:13:47,050 --> 01:13:50,730
不 长官 魔鬼喜欢隐藏秘密
No, Sir, the devil loves his unspoken secrets...

701
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:56,850
特别是那些蚕食人的灵魂的秘密
especially those that fester in a man's soul.

702
01:13:58,740 --> 01:14:00,290
你的秘密是什么
What's yours?

703
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:21,400
我不是一个好作家
I'm not a great writer.

704
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:26,440
我不是霍索恩
I'm not Hawthorne.

705
01:14:27,210 --> 01:14:29,460
从我学写作以来
After my first hearing of Odysseus,

706
01:14:30,070 --> 01:14:32,010
这个故事一直困扰着我
this tale has haunted me.

707
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:35,400
它消耗着我
It consumes me.

708
01:14:36,830 --> 01:14:38,670
我害怕如果我不写这个故事
I fear if I do not write it,

709
01:14:40,630 --> 01:14:42,490
我会再也没办法写作
I should never write again.

710
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:45,260
还有什么
What else?

711
01:14:47,030 --> 01:14:49,000
我害怕如果我写这个故事
I fear if I DO write it,

712
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:53,600
写出来的不如故事精彩
that it will not be as good as it should be.

713
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:05,720
继续讲这个故事 先生
Continue the story, Sir...

714
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:08,450
为了彼此
for the both of us.

715
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,000
困住的第34天

716
01:15:24,870 --> 01:15:26,460
传过去
Pass that down.

717
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:32,860
给
Here.

718
01:15:38,190 --> 01:15:41,420
我们感谢你 主 赐予我们的食物
We thank thee, Lord, for this is our food...

719
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:47,110
赐予我们的光 健康 和所有美好的东西
for light, good health, with every good.

720
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:49,030
那里
There.

721
01:15:49,930 --> 01:15:50,960
陆地
Land!

722
01:15:52,170 --> 01:15:54,030
陆地 欧文 陆地
Land, Owen! Land!

723
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:57,400
陆地 陆地 陆地
Land! Land! Land!

724
01:15:57,510 --> 01:16:00,060
划船 快
Row! Get 'way! Get 'way!

725
01:16:03,530 --> 01:16:05,740
划船
Row!

726
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:27,150
停下 停下 停下
Hold fast! Hold fast! Hold fast!

727
01:16:28,610 --> 01:16:30,420
查斯 什么东西 长官
Mr.Chase, what is it, Sir?

728
01:16:30,530 --> 01:16:34,120
查斯 那是什么怪物 你怎么停下了
Mr. Chase, what the devil is it, why have you stopped?

729
01:16:34,190 --> 01:16:36,350
他一直在跟着我们 什么
- He's been following us. - What?

730
01:16:38,310 --> 01:16:39,650
那里什么都没有 查斯先生
There's nothin' out there, Mr. Chase.

731
01:16:39,730 --> 01:16:41,350
那里什么都没有 长官
There ain't nothin' out there, Sir.

732
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,190
长官 你在干什么
Sir, what are you doing?

733
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:27,140
他在哪儿
Where is he?

734
01:19:28,650 --> 01:19:30,560
这可能是迪西岛
It could be Ducie Island.

735
01:19:31,330 --> 01:19:34,470
没有地图 指南针 象限仪 没办法确认
Without a map, compass or quadrant there's no way to be certain.

736
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:36,830
我们昼夜都亮着火
We will keep fires going night and day,

737
01:19:37,390 --> 01:19:40,550
但愿过往的船只注意到我们的浓烟
hope a passing ship catches sight of our smoke.

738
01:20:37,450 --> 01:20:39,600
这是我想让你们看的
This is what I wanted you to see.

739
01:20:47,790 --> 01:20:50,400
他们肯定在这很长时间了
They've been here a long time, for no doubt...

740
01:20:51,190 --> 01:20:52,620
一定也在等船只
waiting for a ship.

741
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:55,170
但是没有船来过
But no ship came.

742
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:59,610
没有船会来
No ship is going to come.

743
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:02,200
如果我们呆在这 我们会死
If we stay, we die.

744
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:05,170
你们觉得如果鸟儿过来看到
How long do you think it would take to trust the birds

745
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:07,780
自己的蛋被吃了会多久不再过来
to stop coming here once they see their eggs eaten?

746
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:30,350
这是知道自己将要死去的好处
It's a privilege to know the moment of one's death in advance.

747
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:32,410
可以为此准备
And to be able to prepare for it...

748
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:36,690
离家太远的诅咒
a curse to be so far from home...

749
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:42,150
或者有机会说再见但没机会和解
or a chance to say goodbyes, without a chance to make peace...

750
01:21:43,010 --> 01:21:45,300
或者报仇的机会
or a chance to settle scores.

751
01:21:48,250 --> 01:21:50,990
但是 我们之间清楚了
But alas, at least those are settled between us,

752
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:52,850
船长
Cap'n?

753
01:21:54,790 --> 01:21:56,350
什么船长
Captain of what?

754
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:59,280
埃塞克斯号沉没了不是你的责任
The Essex was lost and no fault o'yours.

755
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:02,420
我该受谴责 你不是船长
- I was as much to blame... - You were not the Captain!

756
01:22:07,850 --> 01:22:10,150
你天生就是干这活的料
You were born to do this job.

757
01:22:10,990 --> 01:22:13,080
我只是生下来只能干这个
I was just born into it.

758
01:22:25,830 --> 01:22:27,830
我们干了什么 你觉得 乔治
What we do, do ya think, George?

759
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:33,530
我们干了什么冒犯了上帝 让他这么不开心
What offense did we give God to upset him so?

760
01:22:33,580 --> 01:22:36,480
冒犯上帝的是那些白鲸
The only creature to have offended God here is the whale.

761
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:38,470
不是我们
Not us?

762
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:44,000
不是我们的傲慢 我们的贪婪 看我们现在在哪儿
Not our arrogance, our greed? Look where we find ourselves.

763
01:22:44,050 --> 01:22:46,580
我们是上帝按自己喜好创造出来的高级生物
We are supreme creatures made in God's own likeness.

764
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:49,610
我们是地球上的主宰
We're earthly kings,

765
01:22:49,860 --> 01:22:53,660
我们要环航我们居住的星球
whose business it is to circumnavigate the planet bestowed to us.

766
01:22:54,250 --> 01:22:56,410
将自然屈服于我们的意志
And to bend nature to OUR will.

767
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:00,080
我们经历了这么多你还觉得主宰一切吗
You really feel like an earthly king after everything that we've been through?

768
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:06,050
我们什么都不是 我们是微粒 灰尘 但是我们
- We're nothing... we're specks... dust. - But we're...

769
01:23:07,070 --> 01:23:09,160
拂晓时朝太阳方向行驶
We sail into the sun at dawn.

770
01:23:10,490 --> 01:23:14,120
如果我们要死 死在上帝的光辉里
If we are to die, with God's grace.

771
01:23:15,130 --> 01:23:17,060
让我们像男人一样死去
Let us die as men.

772
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:31,340
我们准备好了吗 维克斯先生 是的 长官
- Are we ready, Mr. Weeks? - Aye, Sir.

773
01:23:38,570 --> 01:23:40,260
查普尔先生
Mr. Chappel.

774
01:23:40,330 --> 01:23:42,930
莱特先生 我不能 长官
- Mr. Wright. - I can't do it, Sir.

775
01:23:44,070 --> 01:23:45,800
我 洛克斯 维克斯
Me, Locks and Weeks...

776
01:23:47,110 --> 01:23:48,590
我们留下来
we're stayin'.

777
01:23:57,110 --> 01:23:58,280
准备出发 马修
Ready to go, Matthew?

778
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:12,220
我来帮你一把 有什么用
- I'll give you a hand here... - What's the point?

779
01:24:12,470 --> 01:24:14,610
你听见我说的吗 不 我们一起回家 一起回家
- You hear me? - No, we're goin' home, we're goin' home.

780
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:16,080
没用的
There's no point.

781
01:24:16,890 --> 01:24:18,340
走吧
Just go.

782
01:24:22,150 --> 01:24:24,370
妈的 马修
God damn it, Matthew.

783
01:24:27,070 --> 01:24:28,470
没事的
It's all right.

784
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:31,600
我回家立马派一艘船过来接你
I'll send a boat for you the minute we get back.

785
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:34,050
然后我们回到楠塔基特玩牌 好吗
And we'll play cards back in Nantucket, all right?

786
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:37,730
好 一言为定 好
- Yeah, it's a deal. - Good.

787
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:46,360
你要我帮你打开水壶吗
You want me to open that for ya?

788
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:52,510
我能行的
Naw, I think I'll manage.

789
01:24:58,670 --> 01:25:00,330
上帝保佑你 兄弟
God be with you, Brother.

790
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:03,970
也保佑你
And you.

791
01:25:22,510 --> 01:25:24,220
彼得森
Brother Peterson?

792
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:28,760
你一起跟我们走吧 彼得森先生
- Y'all comin' with us? - Mr. Peterson.

793
01:25:28,990 --> 01:25:31,560
和邦德一起登船走吧
Why don't you come on our boat with Mr. Bond.

794
01:25:58,990 --> 01:26:02,560
困住的第48天

795
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:07,050
在哪儿 他在哪儿
Where... where is he?

796
01:26:08,150 --> 01:26:09,890
波拉德
Pollard.

797
01:26:10,670 --> 01:26:13,140
劳伦斯先生 劳伦斯先生 醒醒
Mr. Lawrence, Mr. Lawrence, wake up.

798
01:26:14,770 --> 01:26:16,790
另一条船去哪儿了
Where has the other boat gone?

799
01:26:17,260 --> 01:26:19,220
波拉德 波拉德 船长波拉德
- Pollard! Pollard! - Captain Pollard!

800
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:22,230
波拉德 波拉德 船长波拉德
- Pollard! Pollard! - Cap'n Pollard!

801
01:26:22,410 --> 01:26:24,220
波拉德 船长
- Pollard! - Captain!

802
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:31,140
波拉德
Pollard!

803
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:36,910
休息会儿
Get some rest.

804
01:26:52,570 --> 01:26:54,780
本杰明 你在干什么
Benjamin, what are you doing?

805
01:26:54,830 --> 01:26:56,480
他死了
He's dead.

806
01:26:56,940 --> 01:26:58,690
把他丢海里 长官
Throwing him overboard, Sir.

807
01:27:00,470 --> 01:27:03,460
看着我 看着我 本杰明
Look at me, look at me Benjamin.

808
01:27:08,270 --> 01:27:12,400
没有理智的水手会丢弃也许会救自己一命的东西
No right minded sailor discards what might yet save him.

809
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:25,610
听我说 孩子 听我说
Listen to me, Boy, listen to me.

810
01:27:29,650 --> 01:27:31,850
他能救我们
He can help us.

811
01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:34,240
我的上帝 我们神圣的
My God, our heavenly...

812
01:27:39,180 --> 01:27:42,720
这些生物每日祈盼着食物
Thy creatures wait On Thee for daily food.

813
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:02,870
决定了
So it was decided.

814
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:11,080
我们准备了尸体
We prepared the body.

815
01:28:13,990 --> 01:28:16,070
我们去除了内脏
We removed the organs.

816
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:21,210
分割了他的四肢
Separated his limbs from his body.

817
01:28:22,810 --> 01:28:25,840
从骨头上切下了所有的肉
And cut all the flesh from the bones.

818
01:28:29,900 --> 01:28:31,680
然后
After which...

819
01:28:32,270 --> 01:28:34,190
我们拼起了尸块
we closed body.

820
01:28:35,650 --> 01:28:37,260
然后把尸体缝起来
And then we sewed it up...

821
01:28:37,550 --> 01:28:39,560
尽我们所能
as decently as we could...

822
01:28:40,070 --> 01:28:42,750
然后扔到了海里
and committed it to the sea.

823
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:46,420
我们先吃了心脏
We ate the heart first.

824
01:28:54,940 --> 01:28:56,830
你有意见
You judge me.

825
01:28:58,550 --> 01:29:00,190
不
No.

826
01:29:06,220 --> 01:29:09,120
那个
There... there...

827
01:29:10,700 --> 01:29:11,780
说完了
it's done.

828
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:16,040
说完了
It is out.

829
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:19,170
你从未告诉过任何人
You never told anyone?

830
01:29:21,970 --> 01:29:23,050
没有
No.

831
01:29:24,690 --> 01:29:26,520
包括你的妻子
Not even your wife?

832
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:29,910
你觉得如果她知道我做的罪孽
Do you think she could ever love me,

833
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:32,860
她还会爱我吗
if she knew the abominations I had committed?

834
01:29:32,910 --> 01:29:35,780
不 她还会爱你的
Yes, she would.

835
01:29:36,470 --> 01:29:39,680
如果你和我相遇的时候告诉我
And if you had told me this story when we met,

836
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:43,340
我今天还会是你的妻子
I would still wear your ring today.

837
01:29:45,050 --> 01:29:47,070
那个男孩的勇敢
The strength of that boy,

838
01:29:47,220 --> 01:29:49,510
还在你内心
still lives in you.

839
01:29:51,510 --> 01:29:53,390
我看得出
I see that...

840
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,800
即使你自己不觉察
even if you don't.

841
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:19,490
你可以说完你的故事了 亲爱的
You can finish your story now, My Love.

842
01:30:30,780 --> 01:30:32,180
嘿
Look...

843
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:37,630
坐起来
Sit up.

844
01:30:40,230 --> 01:30:41,440
听着
Listen.

845
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:44,040
妈的
Damn thing.

846
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:49,470
我们还有些水
We still got a few drops of the water left.

847
01:30:49,690 --> 01:30:52,350
别放弃 我们要回家了
Don't ya quit on me, we're goin' home.

848
01:30:57,940 --> 01:30:59,690
你还有家人在吗
Do you have a family...

849
01:31:00,390 --> 01:31:02,230
查斯先生
back home, Mr. Chase?

850
01:31:02,260 --> 01:31:03,640
有的 我的妻子
Yeah, I have wife.

851
01:31:07,490 --> 01:31:09,930
对 还有一个儿子和一个女儿
Yes, and a son or a daughter.

852
01:31:23,490 --> 01:31:26,930
困住的第71天 南美以西1200海里

853
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,830
好
Very well.

854
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:00,120
船长 我们重新抽签
Cap'n, we'll draw again.

855
01:32:00,290 --> 01:32:02,600
我们不会这么做
We'll do no such thing.

856
01:32:03,530 --> 01:32:06,240
我们重新抽 拉姆斯德尔先生
- We'll draw again. - Mr. Ramsdell,

857
01:32:07,290 --> 01:32:10,180
你要用这枪来指挥
you will assume command of this vessel.

858
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:16,100
你明白
Ya got that?

859
01:32:16,150 --> 01:32:19,440
你是我们的船长 你的船员需要你
You're our cap'n, your men need you.

860
01:32:20,540 --> 01:32:22,140
船员没事的
The men will be fine.

861
01:32:23,110 --> 01:32:26,550
拜托了 拜托了
Please. Please. Please.

862
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:28,760
亨利 让我们再抽签
- Henry... - Let us go again.

863
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:31,320
这是命令
It is an order.

864
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:34,460
如果你做不到
If you cannot do it,

865
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:36,850
把枪给其他人
pass the pistol to another man.

866
01:33:21,890 --> 01:33:24,180
我们在赤道无风带几周了
We were weeks in the Doldrums.

867
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:27,070
太平洋那片区域远比海洋枯竭
That part of the Pacific is more desert than ocean.

868
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:30,700
太阳炙热
The sun beating down...

869
01:33:30,740 --> 01:33:32,340
我害怕
My fear...

870
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:35,160
我能想到的是
All I could think about...

871
01:33:36,690 --> 01:33:40,340
所有人都会死而我是最后一个活着的
was that everyone would die and I'd be the last left alive.

872
01:33:41,680 --> 01:33:46,270
查斯只知道我们离陆地还有800英里
Well, as best as Mr. Chase could tell, we were still 800 miles from land.

873
01:33:51,940 --> 01:33:53,390
查斯先生
Mr. Chase.

874
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:03,230
船长波拉德
Cap'n Pollard.

875
01:34:05,510 --> 01:34:07,470
很高兴见到你
Very happy to see you.

876
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:10,870
我们生存下来没什么值得高兴
Very little happiness in our survival.

877
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:15,110
我们也是 长官
Nor in ours, Sir.

878
01:34:15,370 --> 01:34:16,970
巴尔齐莱号
Barzillai?

879
01:34:19,610 --> 01:34:20,960
另一艘船
The third boat?

880
01:34:22,210 --> 01:34:26,690
他们不见了 几天不见了
They're gone, they've been gone for days.

881
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:29,340
我估计他们迷失了 长官
I'm afraid they're lost, Sir.

882
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,790
查斯先生 你为这个准备好了
Mr. Chase, you are prepared for this.

883
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:19,880
不过是头白鲸
It's just a whale.

884
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:25,490
那里 投茅
There! Throw the lance!

885
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:27,540
投啊
Throw it!

886
01:35:31,630 --> 01:35:34,390
投啊
Throw it, drown the lad!

887
01:35:45,570 --> 01:35:48,250
投啊
Throw it!

888
01:35:57,090 --> 01:36:01,560
就是现在 投茅啊
Do it! Now! Throw the lance!

889
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:22,030
你为什么不投
Why didn't you throw it?

890
01:36:48,050 --> 01:36:49,870
你他妈是个傻子
You're a damn fool.

891
01:37:12,970 --> 01:37:15,840
洋流把我们拆散了
The current drew us apart...

892
01:37:16,730 --> 01:37:20,300
那是我们最后一次见到船长波拉德的鲸船
and that was the last we would see of Captain Pollard's whale boat.

893
01:37:21,730 --> 01:37:23,000
困住的第87天

894
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:25,260
一艘船
A boat!

895
01:37:25,470 --> 01:37:27,680
前方有一艘船
A boat on the forward bow!

896
01:37:53,090 --> 01:37:55,030
上帝仁慈
May god have mercy.

897
01:38:08,090 --> 01:38:11,030
困住的第90天 1821年2月18日

898
01:38:37,570 --> 01:38:39,150
查斯先生
Mr. Chase.

899
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:44,340
父亲
Father...

900
01:38:45,990 --> 01:38:48,430
别丢下我 父亲
don't leave me, Father.

901
01:39:38,190 --> 01:39:40,330
嘿 长官
Hey, Sir.

902
01:39:40,970 --> 01:39:45,280
查斯先生 长官 看 看 长官
Mr. Chase. Sir. Look. Look, Sir.

903
01:39:48,940 --> 01:39:49,940
长官
Sir.

904
01:39:50,790 --> 01:39:53,040
看 那里
Look. Out there.

905
01:39:53,380 --> 01:39:54,750
他们来了
They're coming.

906
01:39:58,740 --> 01:40:01,150
他们来救我们了
They're coming for us.

907
01:40:23,030 --> 01:40:28,120
我们在那里被救了
We were rescued there, off the Isle of Mбs Afuera, Chile,

908
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:31,970
埃塞克斯号沉船90天后
ninety days after the sinking of the Essex.

909
01:40:33,330 --> 01:40:37,440
他们给我们一些衣服和皮革吃
They gave us some old clothes... leathers, too.

910
01:40:38,310 --> 01:40:42,300
起先感觉很难吃
It was hard to eat at first... strange.

911
01:40:43,340 --> 01:40:45,130
他们尽力照顾我们
They looked after us as best they could,

912
01:40:45,230 --> 01:40:48,430
然后他们找到了可以带我们回家的一艘船
then we found a ship that could carry us home.

913
01:40:49,270 --> 01:40:52,440
回家又花了三个月
That voyage took another three months.

914
01:40:53,270 --> 01:40:55,440
1821年6月11日 楠塔基特港口

915
01:41:00,630 --> 01:41:04,110
全岛的人好像都过来看我们回来
It looked like the whole Island turned out to see us return.

916
01:41:05,330 --> 01:41:09,650
但是没有欢呼 只有沉寂
But there were no cheers... only silence.

917
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:17,040
他们看我们的样子像是看到鬼 幽灵
They looked at us like we were... apparitions... phantoms.

918
01:41:17,740 --> 01:41:22,000
我们没有对任何人说起我们生存的细节
We'd said nothing of the details of our survival to anyone.

919
01:41:22,060 --> 01:41:26,100
但是我猜他们知道我们的困境
But I wondered if they somehow knew of our privations.

920
01:41:27,250 --> 01:41:29,480
也许他们只是好奇
Maybe they were just curious.

921
01:42:17,070 --> 01:42:19,050
我保证过的 不是吗
I promised, didn't I?

922
01:42:27,510 --> 01:42:28,640
天啊
God.

923
01:42:31,890 --> 01:42:34,320
嘿 宝贝 你是谁啊
Hey, Sweetie! Who is this?

924
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:37,050
菲比安
Phebe Ann.

925
01:42:41,030 --> 01:42:42,870
菲比安·查斯
Phebe Ann Chase.

926
01:42:43,930 --> 01:42:45,760
他是你的父亲
It's your Daddy.

927
01:42:47,350 --> 01:42:49,190
嘿 宝贝
Hey, Sweetie.

928
01:42:53,930 --> 01:42:56,360
他是你的父亲
It's your Daddy.

929
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:15,440
当然还是有人找上他
Of course they couldn't leave him alone.

930
01:43:15,710 --> 01:43:18,650
查斯先生和他的妻子往家走了不久
Mr. Chase and his wife had scarcely walked a block towards home

931
01:43:18,730 --> 01:43:21,880
他就被拦下来并带回了海事办公室
when he was stopped and made to return to the Maritime Office.

932
01:43:23,340 --> 01:43:26,080
生意上的事还有疑问
There were business matters still in question.

933
01:43:40,050 --> 01:43:41,710
对于这件事
So, to the matter...

934
01:43:46,110 --> 01:43:49,610
因为我们此次航线造成了巨大的人员和财产损失
Due to the significant loss of life and property on our voyage,

935
01:43:50,120 --> 01:43:52,610
将会有一场听证会
it seems there will be an inquiry.

936
01:43:53,070 --> 01:43:57,510
作为船长和大副 我们需要交待事实经过
And, as Captain and first mate, we will be expected to give account of what happened.

937
01:43:57,960 --> 01:43:59,290
是的 当然
Yes, of course.

938
01:43:59,350 --> 01:44:04,030
我就这件事和船主和我父亲讨论过
And, having discussed this with the ship owners and... my father,

939
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:08,620
显然完全交待经过会有后果
it is clear that full disclosure will have ramifications...

940
01:44:09,270 --> 01:44:12,110
对整个行业有可怕的后果
terrible ramifications for whole industry.

941
01:44:13,060 --> 01:44:15,560
一头白鲸弄沉了埃塞克斯号
That a whale brought down the Essex.

942
01:44:16,590 --> 01:44:18,880
但这是事实
But it's the truth.

943
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:29,930
如果保险商和投资人开始担心
If the insurance houses and investors were to start worrying about...

944
01:44:30,010 --> 01:44:32,910
海怪把船弄沉
sea monsters sinking ships,

945
01:44:33,230 --> 01:44:35,970
水手们很难活下来
sailors drawing lots to survive...

946
01:44:37,200 --> 01:44:40,800
我们在石油行业 所有人
We are in the oil business... all of us.

947
01:44:41,430 --> 01:44:46,930
在任何一个行业成功的机率一定要比失败的风险要高
And as in any business the probability of success must always be greater the risk incurred.

948
01:44:48,720 --> 01:44:50,590
那么 你有什么建议 乔治
So, what are you suggesting, George?

949
01:44:50,820 --> 01:44:53,030
你就说船搁浅了
That you say that the ship ran aground.

950
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:56,910
那是个谎言 并且说船员是淹死的
- That's a lie. - And that the men that died drowned.

951
01:44:57,340 --> 01:44:58,120
那也是个谎言
That's another lie.

952
01:44:58,170 --> 01:45:00,120
想想吧 他们会让你当船长
Think on it... they will make you captain.

953
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:02,430
那个我是有书面保证的
Oh! That pledge I already have in writing.

954
01:45:02,540 --> 01:45:06,540
那个前提是你带回一船的鲸油
Only on the condition you bring home a ship full of oil.

955
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:09,480
这么做会确保你这件事
This way it's guaranteed.

956
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:11,970
你会变成有钱人
You would be a wealthy man.

957
01:45:12,110 --> 01:45:16,410
查斯不再是陆人的名字 而是有记录的
The name Chase need no longer be a landsman's name, but an established name

958
01:45:16,440 --> 01:45:19,960
属于楠塔基特岛伟大家族的名字
that belongs among the great families of Nantucket.

959
01:45:20,740 --> 01:45:23,300
你要我为了功名掩盖发生的一切
You want me to whitewash what happened for profit?

960
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:27,180
我们是要你务实些
We're asking you to be pragmatic.

961
01:45:42,680 --> 01:45:45,490
埃塞克斯号是被一头白鲸撞沉的
The Essex was stoved by a white whale.

962
01:45:45,970 --> 01:45:48,800
我们幸存下来的在装备不良的捕鲸船上
And those of us that survived in ill-equipped whale boats

963
01:45:48,870 --> 01:45:53,040
只能靠犯下罪孽才能存活
had to commit abominations in order to survive.

964
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:57,340
我们回来后 又被指望传播公然露骨的谎言
And on our return, we're expected to spread barefaced lies,

965
01:45:57,700 --> 01:46:00,850
好让你们这些楠塔基特岛岛船主们
so that you, the ship owners of Nantucket,

966
01:46:01,310 --> 01:46:04,220
赚钱晚上再睡得安稳觉吗
might line your pockets and sleep well at night?

967
01:46:05,340 --> 01:46:08,810
我不会掩盖真相
Well, I will not embroil the truth.

968
01:46:08,860 --> 01:46:10,690
乔治 你也不应该
Nor should you, George.

969
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:32,060
我最后一次见他
That last time I saw him...

970
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:33,810
查斯先生 长官
Mr. Chase, Sir.

971
01:46:34,250 --> 01:46:37,810
我说不出我想说的话
I couldn't find the right words to say what I wanted.

972
01:46:38,670 --> 01:46:39,950
汤姆斯
Thomas.

973
01:46:40,940 --> 01:46:42,710
也许我没什么想说的
Perhaps there ARE no words.

974
01:46:45,110 --> 01:46:48,130
我 我要去法尔茅斯了
I'm... I'm gonna be on my way to Falmouth, and...

975
01:46:51,260 --> 01:46:52,920
那个
it's...

976
01:46:53,050 --> 01:46:55,360
那个 很荣幸 长官
it's... it's been an honor, Sir,

977
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:57,500
能够服务于您
to serve with you.

978
01:47:00,760 --> 01:47:03,570
是我的荣幸 尼克森先生
The honor has been mine, Mr. Nickerson.

979
01:47:20,750 --> 01:47:22,470
拿着
Take it.

980
01:47:27,030 --> 01:47:28,930
祝你好运 汤姆斯
Good luck out there, Thomas.

981
01:47:30,040 --> 01:47:31,740
谢谢 长官
Thank you, Sir.

982
01:48:00,630 --> 01:48:03,920
第二天乔治·波拉德被召唤到听证会
Next day George Pollard was called before the inquiry.

983
01:48:08,460 --> 01:48:10,800
先生们 船长乔治·波拉德
Gentlemen, Captain George Pollard.

984
01:48:11,340 --> 01:48:13,910
楠塔基特所有重要人物都在那儿
All the important men of Nantucket were there...

985
01:48:14,890 --> 01:48:17,240
这是惯例
it was a formality.

986
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:20,230
日安 船长 请坐
Good day to you, Captain, please sit down.

987
01:48:25,810 --> 01:48:27,610
事实是
For the record then.

988
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:35,060
埃塞克斯号是在厄瓜多尔以西被一头1200多米长的白鲸撞沉的
The Essex was stoved by a white whale 12 hundred meters west of Ecuador.

989
01:48:35,130 --> 01:48:38,160
就像欧文·查斯说的那样
It was as if Owen Chase himself had spoken.

990
01:48:39,830 --> 01:48:41,940
他告诉了他们真相
He told them the truth.

991
01:48:45,300 --> 01:48:47,890
船长波拉德的良心发现了
Cap'n Pollard's conscience was clear...

992
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,460
但那场听证会是个耻辱
but the inquiry was a sham.

993
01:48:52,950 --> 01:48:55,390


994
01:48:57,440 --> 01:49:01,420
至于那头白鲸 他们再也没有找到
over the white whale... they never found it.

995
01:49:02,710 --> 01:49:05,640
他再一次出航但在夏威夷搁浅
He ran a second ship aground off of Hawaii...

996
01:49:06,750 --> 01:49:07,970
两次诅咒
twice cursed.

997
01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:11,240
再也没有出航过
Never sailed again.

998
01:49:11,490 --> 01:49:13,140
欧文·查斯
And Owen Chase?

999
01:49:14,240 --> 01:49:16,280
他说到做到
He was a man of his word.

1000
01:49:16,710 --> 01:49:19,680
他派了一艘船去了杜斯特岛
First, he sent a boat back to Ducie Island.

1001
01:49:20,750 --> 01:49:22,590
花花公子已经死了
Mr. Joy had passed...

1002
01:49:22,850 --> 01:49:26,360
但是其他人居然还都活着
but the other three were incredibly still alive.

1003
01:49:29,210 --> 01:49:30,480
然后呢
And then?

1004
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:34,600
他带着家人搬到了新贝德福德
Then he packed up his family and moved to New Bedford...

1005
01:49:36,590 --> 01:49:38,220
去重新开始生活
to start over...

1006
01:49:38,700 --> 01:49:40,740
在一家商店
in a merchant...

1007
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,390
完成自己的人生旅程
sailing his own terms.

1008
01:49:52,610 --> 01:49:56,080
你用钱换到故事了 梅尔维尔先生
Well, you certainly got your money's worth, Mr. Melville.

1009
01:49:56,330 --> 01:49:58,720
这二月的夜晚真是一年中最漫长的
These February nights are the longest of the year.

1010
01:49:59,010 --> 01:50:02,070
你们都可以休息了 我不行
- Well, you can both rest now. - Leave me...

1011
01:50:02,380 --> 01:50:05,250
我还有一段时间不能休息
I shall not be resting for some time.

1012
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:06,930
为什么
Why?

1013
01:50:07,650 --> 01:50:12,820
你得到了你的故事 情节都有了
Ya got your story there, and your plot is all there.

1014
01:50:12,870 --> 01:50:16,600
也许我想要的不是情节
Maybe it wasn't a plot I was after.

1015
01:50:16,750 --> 01:50:18,810
不是 那是什么
No, what then?

1016
01:50:18,990 --> 01:50:21,490
你今晚给我的其他东西
Something else you've given me tonight.

1017
01:50:21,540 --> 01:50:23,050
是什么
What is that?

1018
01:50:23,630 --> 01:50:28,320
敢于去别人不敢去的地方的勇气
The courage to go where... one does not want to go.

1019
01:50:29,740 --> 01:50:31,580
梅尔维尔先生
Mr. Melville,

1020
01:50:31,870 --> 01:50:34,920
你听到的 我告诉你的
what you've heard, what I've told you,

1021
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:42,090
是否都会成为你书中的一部分
will it all be of service to your book?

1022
01:50:43,180 --> 01:50:46,780
这会是部虚构的小说 尼克森先生
It will be a work of fiction, Mr. Nickerson,

1023
01:50:47,930 --> 01:50:49,850
受真实事件启发
inspired by truth,

1024
01:50:50,970 --> 01:50:54,570
但我不觉得我会用全部事实
but I don't believe I'll feel the need to use all of it.

1025
01:51:03,330 --> 01:51:04,660
谢谢 给
- Thank you. - Here...

1026
01:51:05,140 --> 01:51:06,350
拿着这个
take that with you.

1027
01:51:06,410 --> 01:51:08,760
不 钱是给你的 我坚持
No, the money is for you, I insist.

1028
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:11,160
我坚持你要收下
I insist you keep it.

1029
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:16,050
我坚持这谈话里还是有一个人是清醒的
And I insist that one person in this conversation is sober.

1030
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:29,220
该回马萨诸塞州皮茨菲尔德了
So, it's back to Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

1031
01:51:29,750 --> 01:51:32,310
祝你好运
Well, good luck.

1032
01:51:33,420 --> 01:51:34,680
谢谢
Thank you.

1033
01:51:38,120 --> 01:51:39,550
你知道吗
Ya know...

1034
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:43,750
我听说宾夕法尼亚州一个人最近在地上钻了一个洞
I heard a man from Pennsylvania drilled a hole in the ground recently,

1035
01:51:44,530 --> 01:51:46,260
发现了油
and found oil.

1036
01:51:46,730 --> 01:51:48,570
不会是真的吧
That can't be true.

1037
01:51:49,050 --> 01:51:50,570
我也听说过
I heard it, too.

1038
01:51:52,370 --> 01:51:55,390
地上的油
Oil from ground.

1039
01:51:56,500 --> 01:51:58,940
真想不到
Fancy that.

1040
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:37,940
赫尔曼·梅尔维尔 1850年完成了他的小说

1041
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:47,940
一年后白鲸记发表

1042
01:52:50,500 --> 01:52:57,940
对于白鲸记纳撒尼尔·霍桑盛赞它会成为美国伟大的作品

1043
01:52:57,940 --> 01:53:57,940
