1
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,820
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}How does one come to know the unknowable?

2
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,830
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}"What faculties must a man possess?

3
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:27,120
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}"Since it was discovered that whale oil could light our cities in ways never achieved before,

4
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,840
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}"it created global demand.

5
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,090
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}"It has pushed man to venture further and further

6
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,930
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}"into the deep blue unknown.

7
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,300
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}"We know not its depths,

8
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,140
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}"nor the host of creatures that live there.

9
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,020
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}"Monsters.

10
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,770
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}"Are they real?

11
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:59,530
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}"Or do the stories exist only to make us respect the sea's dark secrets?

12
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,710
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}"The question both vexes and excites me

13
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:19,220
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}"and is the reason I've written you a second time to request a meeting.

14
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:23,970
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}"A conversation with you, sir, I believe will serve me well for the novel I intend to write,

15
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,230
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}"currently entitled Moby Dick.

16
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,900
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}"I hope you will reconsider my offer.

17
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,400
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}"The unknown.

18
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,360
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}"That is where my imagination yearns to venture.

19
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,910
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}"And so the question plagues me still.

20
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,910
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}"How does a man come to know the unknowable?

21
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,580
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}"Sincerely, Herman Melville."

22
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,170
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We're closed.

23
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,420
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}No boarders after 8:00.

24
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,600
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You came.

25
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,190
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Someone here for you, my love.

26
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,860
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Tom Nickerson?

27
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,120
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Herman Melville.

28
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,780
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We received your letter.

29
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,790
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You're either a desperate man or a fool to come all the way to Nantucket.

30
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,670
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Well, my offer still stands.

31
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,630
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Three months' lodgings for a single night's talk.

32
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,220
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}All I have in the world.

33
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,390
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}But I prefer to think of it as an investment.

34
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:50,310
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I want you to tell me what happened to the Essex.

35
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,190
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}What do you think happened?

36
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,150
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}There are rumblings.

37
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,320
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Rumors that the Essex was... - What do you want?

38
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,160
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}What story do you expect to hear?

39
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,410
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}That of the whale.

40
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,460
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}The Essex ran aground. There was a full inquiry.

41
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,460
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I believe the inquiry was less than truthful.

42
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,340
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Get out.

43
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,510
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You are the last survivor of the Essex, sir.

44
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,180
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}If you won't talk, who will?

45
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,350
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Did you not hear me?

46
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,680
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Leave. Now.

47
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,520
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- No. You mustn't go. Please. - He is in no mind to talk.

48
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,860
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}And I haven't come all this way to be humiliated and waste my time.

49
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,610
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Please, Mr. Melville.

50
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,530
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}He won't talk about the Essex to me.

51
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,780
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}To anyone. Never has. Never.

52
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,450
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}There's an agony about him.

53
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,210
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}His soul

54
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,710
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}is in torment,

55
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,380
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}and in need of confession.

56
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:02,300
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Please, just let me talk to him. Please.

57
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,350
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Love.

58
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,060
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I believe it would do you good to talk to the man.

59
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,150
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}No.

60
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,570
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You listen well.

61
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:29,120
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Who holds this place together while you drink yourself to death?

62
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:34,750
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You will talk with this man as much as is necessary to keep the money.

63
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,250
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You know our circumstances, Thomas.

64
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,260
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Only as much as is necessary.

65
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,100
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I'll get whiskey.

66
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:09,530
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I neglected to mention it in my letter, but I was a whaler once.

67
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,620
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}One trip, I mean.

68
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,450
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Green hand.

69
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,960
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}So, you've seen it all.

70
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,040
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}My wife read your books.

71
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,050
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}She enjoyed them.

72
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,960
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I'm happy to hear it.

73
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,800
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I've had good sales.

74
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,640
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}And I think this story

75
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,430
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}could surpass the success of even my first novel,

76
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,970
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}which did quite well.

77
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,480
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Another of your seafaring yarns?

78
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,610
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Have you read Hawthorne, Mr. Melville?

79
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,280
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Now there's a writer.

80
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,320
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Great writer.

81
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,160
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}He is.

82
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,750
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}But he is not here. And I am.

83
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,250
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}For my own particular reasons.

84
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,630
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I will tell you of the Essex.

85
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,680
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I believe you will be disappointed.

86
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,680
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}But every word I say will be true.

87
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,850
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Story of the Essex

88
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,270
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}is the story of two men.

89
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,690
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Captain George Pollard

90
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,320
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}and his first mate,

91
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,530
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Owen Chase.

92
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,320
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Owen.

93
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,870
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You don't wanna be late.

94
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,370
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I'll be there.

95
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,830
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Besides, can't have our daughter sleeping under a leaky roof, can we?

96
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,210
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}What makes you so sure it's a girl?

97
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,210
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Well, it has to be.

98
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,590
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}So she can remind me why I still love you when you're being stubborn.

99
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,510
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Well, if it's to be a daughter, she'll be a version of you, not me.

100
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,670
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Blond locks and determined to conquer the world.

101
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,970
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I suppose after today, you'll be trading in that tunic for a uniform.

102
00:07:55,140 --> 00:08:00,060
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}That's right. Finally out of this patch of dirt, into a captain's house like you deserve.

103
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:03,400
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I don't need one of those houses in town with stuffy neighbors.

104
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,270
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}There's plenty of room here for the three of us.

105
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,190
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You know, sometimes your kind heart and good nature

106
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,360
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}is just unbearable.

107
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,200
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Go get your captaincy.

108
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,120
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- What's your bid? - I'll have $1.90.

109
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:03,120
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- I've got 1,000 gallons at $2! - I'll take 40 shares!

110
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,790
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Seller! Seller! Over here!

111
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,630
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Criterion's back with a fine haul. 1,600 barrels.

112
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:21,220
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}A new record. 50 pounds sterling for head matter on the London market.

113
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,600
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Congratulations.

114
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,490
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Good morning, Mr. Chase. - Mr. Mason.

115
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,110
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Come in, please.

116
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,950
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}My partner, Benjamin Fuller.

117
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,240
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Good morning, sir.

118
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,000
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Do sit down.

119
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,750
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Chase.

120
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,420
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I do hope you realize how satisfied we are

121
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,510
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}with the work you've done for us over the years.

122
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,340
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Thank you, sir.

123
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,760
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Now, one of our ships, the Essex,

124
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:02,180
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}has just been refitted at great expense and is to go to sea.

125
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:08,520
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Now, having made such an investment in her, we want to be sure she's in the best possible hands.

126
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:09,810
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}So,

127
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,030
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}it gives us great pleasure to offer you a position aboard her.

128
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,360
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}As first mate.

129
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,370
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}As first mate?

130
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,540
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Mason, you promised me command of a ship after my last voyage

131
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:30,130
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}when I brought you back 1,500 barrels. Do you remember? You gave me your word.

132
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,380
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}That promise must now be deferred.

133
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:36,550
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Like everyone else, we've had a lean time recently.

134
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,880
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}No, never on my watch.

135
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:41,180
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Nantucket now dominates the world market.

136
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,560
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}That must not change.

137
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:46,640
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}This is no time for experimentation.

138
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,650
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}The Essex will be captained by George Pollard,

139
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,690
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}scion of a great whaling family.

140
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,400
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}His father also happens to be our patron.

141
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,820
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Blood, Mr. Chase.

142
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,490
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You can have all the voyages under your belt you want,

143
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,330
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}but blood will always win out.

144
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,040
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Yes, well, blood is not gonna fill a ship with oil, Mr. Mason.

145
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,370
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}To successfully command, a captain needs respect. Now, what if the men don't respect him?

146
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,830
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You will make sure that they do.

147
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,920
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Ah, good day, gentlemen.

148
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:18,550
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I understand your disappointment,

149
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,930
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}so, a one-fifteenth lay.

150
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,470
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}That's more than I've ever paid any first officer.

151
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:31,600
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}And if you bring back 2,000 barrels of oil, I give you my word,

152
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,270
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}next time, you will have your captaincy.

153
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,320
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You've given me your word before, Mr. Mason.

154
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,450
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}No, this time, I'll take it in writing.

155
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,630
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Captain Pollard.

156
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,470
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We've just had a most agreeable conversation with Mr. Chase.

157
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,970
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}He'll be honored to serve under you.

158
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,720
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I'm glad to hear it.

159
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,770
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Now I'm to babysit a greenhorn.

160
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,730
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Some chinless Nantucketer born with a damn silver spoon in his mouth.

161
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,810
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You know, I should've thrown the offer back in their faces.

162
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:19,110
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Why? You now have the offer of command in writing.

163
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,570
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Yes, well, a liar's word is worthless, even on paper.

164
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:36,130
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You know, I'd love you just as much if you were a merchant captain.

165
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,500
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}And you wouldn't be gone for two years.

166
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,090
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I won't be gone two years.

167
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,510
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}A Bedford whaler came back last week who was gone three.

168
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,180
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}She lost two men and still with her hull half empty.

169
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:49,260
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Yeah, well, they were from Bedford, and they didn't have me on board.

170
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,940
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Son of a bitch!

171
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,530
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I will captain my own ship!

172
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,780
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}A whaling ship.

173
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:08,240
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Up to them, all we'd ever have is this patch of dirt, and that's not gonna happen, Peggy.

174
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,410
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Those are your father's words, not yours.

175
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,700
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}What's wrong with his words?

176
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,460
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}He wanted things for his family, for himself.

177
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:17,880
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}He was a dreamer, Owen.

178
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,710
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Yes, he was.

179
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,960
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Dreamed of the sea and never got to sail it because of men like them.

180
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,300
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}At least he got to see his children born.

181
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,850
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}It's all I know.

182
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,020
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I'm sorry.

183
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,650
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I married a whaleman.

184
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,750
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Hey.

185
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,580
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I'll come back as quick as a summer's night, I swear.

186
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,680
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Just come back.

187
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:13,430
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Promise me.

188
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,690
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I already swore to you. Now you want me to promise, too?

189
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,440
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I promise.

190
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,080
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Son, a word With you.

191
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,960
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}To be a captain, you cannot be a friend.

192
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,630
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You are their superior.

193
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,390
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Never forget that. Never let them forget that.

194
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,930
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Thank you, sir.

195
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,020
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Your great-grandfather and a few others created this industry.

196
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,690
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Without us, without you, the world plunges into darkness.

197
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:05,150
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I hope to bring honor to the Pollard family name, sir.

198
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:15,120
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}"Thou didst, O Lord, create the mighty whale

199
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:18,160
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}"That wondrous monster of a mighty length

200
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:22,000
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}"Beyond conception his unmeasured strength

201
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,420
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}"But, everlasting God, thou dost ordain

202
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:29,170
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}"That we, poor feeble mortals should engage

203
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,850
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}"Ourselves, our wives and children to maintain

204
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:37,600
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}"This dreadful monster with a martial rage"

205
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,690
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}O Father, grant that your glorious light shine on these men.

206
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,690
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Ensure them a prosperous voyage,

207
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:52,990
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}that they may return safely and with a full ship,

208
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:56,240
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}so that the white flames of Nantucket whale oil

209
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,410
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}may continue to keep light in our homes,

210
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:03,460
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}city streets safe from sin in the night,

211
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,800
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}and to fuel the machines of industry

212
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,840
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}that drive our great nation forward

213
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:13,640
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}as our noble species evolves.

214
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,470
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}In your name, we pray.

215
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:25,690
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}So,

216
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,900
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}what month was this?

217
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,440
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Late in the year.

218
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,900
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We were one of the last ships to go out,

219
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,700
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}which is why my friend Barzillai and I got a berth.

220
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:36,620
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You know,

221
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,410
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I was 14. Fourteen.

222
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,790
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Nickerson, you're standing around, boy. Move!

223
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,460
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}First time to sea. Scared,

224
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,920
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}but more scared to show it.

225
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,920
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Barzillai was 17.

226
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,090
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Orphans. Grew up on the wharf.

227
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,880
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Both in a hurry to be called men.

228
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,850
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Grubs, what are those pins they're wearing?

229
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,810
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}They're whale pins, Thomas.

230
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,100
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}How do I get one of them?

231
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,270
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Well, you gotta thrust the killing lance

232
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,480
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Into the largest beast that ever breathed on this Earth.

233
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,030
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Nickerson, get the green stuff to Mr. Bond, there.

234
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,160
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Make it quick, damn it.

235
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,490
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I shall have 12 of those one day.

236
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,540
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Windlass is ready and sails are loose, sir.

237
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,040
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Joy, this is only half my order!

238
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,580
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Put them over the ground tier casks.

239
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,590
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Well, well, you being on board means only one thing.

240
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:34,260
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Yeah, at least there's one person on this ship who knows the truth about Owen Chase.

241
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,760
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}No, that all the other ships have already crewed up.

242
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:39,680
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Now, now. I'm a reformed man, Owen.

243
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,640
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Question is, are you?

244
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,930
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Don't tell me Matthew Joy's put down the bottle.

245
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,600
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Dry as sand.

246
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,810
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Has Owen Chase put down his temper?

247
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,690
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Ah, serene as the church.

248
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,150
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I'll believe that when I see it.

249
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,320
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}And given our captain,

250
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,400
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I'll give your serenity about

251
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,280
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}48 hours?

252
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,240
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Good luck.

253
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,330
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Pollard. George Pollard.

254
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,880
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Owen Chase.

255
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,090
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}"Chase." That's an off-island name, isn't it?

256
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,010
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Yes, it is.

257
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,470
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}And very shortly, we will be off-island for some time, and I'll be very much at home.

258
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,640
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Must say I was surprised.

259
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:25,350
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Normally, a captain gets to choose his first mate.

260
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,810
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}An experienced captain, yes.

261
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:33,530
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}you can understand from the owners' point of view, they want to feel their investment's in the hands of men.

262
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:34,530
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Indeed.

263
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:37,200
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}They probably want a little extra reassurance, that's all.

264
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,740
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Well, do keep an eye on me and let me know if I'm doing anything wrong.

265
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,530
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Oh, I know no other way, Captain.

266
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,130
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Chase, haul short the anchor.

267
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,760
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Yank to the wind! There's topmen aloft.

268
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,510
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Aye! - Mr. Lawrence, take the helm. - Aye, sir.

269
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,090
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Joy, make sail.

270
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,300
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Cole! Mr. Chappel! Stand by the spanker.

271
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,930
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Set your fore staysail and your fore and main topsails.

272
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,730
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Come on, look lively, you lads. - Come on, Nickerson!

273
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,980
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}While we're young! Let fall clews and bunts and sheet ho!

274
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:14,020
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Set topsails and topgallants. Heave away on the windlass.

275
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,610
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Heave away on the windlass.

276
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:22,160
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Set topgallants. Let go clew lines and sheet ho!

277
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:24,280
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}There's a snarl in the gasket, sir.

278
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:25,740
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Chappel, take the helm.

279
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,370
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}It won't clear, Mr. Chase!

280
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:32,040
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Come on! Why aren't those braces laid out?

281
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,840
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Mr. Ray, where are my headsails? - Aye, sir!

282
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,300
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Crank away on the windlass!

283
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,050
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Crank away on the windlass, sir!

284
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,590
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Nickerson, pull!

285
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,270
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Make sail, God damn it!

286
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,020
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}God and all of Nantucket is watching, men.

287
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,070
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Anchor's trim!

288
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:57,860
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Captain! Head down!

289
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,400
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mind your head, Captain.

290
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,990
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}What's the matter, Mr. Sheppard?

291
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,620
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Gasket's fouled the sheet, sir.

292
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:07,790
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}It won't clear, Mr. Chase!

293
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,950
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Topgallant sheet is jammed!

294
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,290
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}The gasket still won't clear!

295
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,080
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We don't have enough sail on yet.

296
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,670
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Still won't clear!

297
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,970
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Watch your step!

298
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,510
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}It's the gasket, Owen!

299
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,230
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Stand clear.

300
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,530
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Whoa! Bloody hell!

301
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,660
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Let fall your course!

302
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,040
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Heave!

303
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,290
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Make fast!

304
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:07,970
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Nice piece of work, Mr. Chase.

305
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,530
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}If we make Cape Verdes in the next two weeks, we'll have a decent chance of reaching the Pacific on schedule.

306
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,200
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Corn, Mr. Chase?

307
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:32,870
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Oh, no, thank you, sir. Never did have much of a taste for it.

308
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,500
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}That's odd.

309
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,540
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Told your father grew corn on Cape Cod.

310
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,880
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}That's right. He did.

311
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:43,550
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}As you can imagine, I certainly grew tired of eating it every day.

312
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:49,970
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Corn. Okra. Beans, I believe?

313
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,470
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Before he went to jail.

314
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,730
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Are you familiar with this story, Mr. Joy?

315
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,440
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Sir?

316
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,230
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Were you aware that

317
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,030
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Chase was effectively orphaned due to his father's incarceration?

318
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,950
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Well, we all have our own paths to sea.

319
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:11,240
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}As a rule, we tend not to ask too many questions.

320
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:15,660
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Hmm. Can't have been easy, though. Yet

321
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,880
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}you had Nantucket's great seafaring family to adopt you.

322
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:24,210
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}This is far from the first time I've been called a landsman or an off-islander

323
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:29,090
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}by some Nantucketer, reminding me how I am not a part of that family.

324
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:34,350
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Now, if the Captain will excuse me, there are whaleboats and watches to assign.

325
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,520
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}No, sir. Not for me.

326
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,240
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Not a drop? - No, sir.

327
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,860
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Like I said,

328
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,280
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}sometimes the fewer questions one asks, the better.

329
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,380
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Serve that food up.

330
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,920
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Getting this slop on the first day?

331
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,960
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Cheap bastards. Where's the meat?

332
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,760
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}That's a gorgeous girl, Mr. Chappel.

333
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:14,600
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}A vision of beauty, that. Carved on a varnished whale bone.

334
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,100
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Let me have a touch. - Don't touch.

335
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,690
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I thought you were married, anyway.

336
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,690
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I am, and there she is.

337
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,020
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Well, that's her nose, anyway.

338
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,690
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Congratulations, ladies.

339
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:32,530
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}That was a fine job trimming sails today.

340
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:35,700
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}A sorrier pack of deck wallopers I don't think I've ever seen.

341
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:38,790
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Chappel.

342
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:39,910
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Sir!

343
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,330
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You're Captain's harpooner.

344
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,790
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Lawrence, you'll be mine.

345
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,250
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Aye, sir.

346
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,960
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}And Mr. Peterson.

347
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,010
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Second mate's harpooner.

348
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,180
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Aye, sir.

349
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,140
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}There'll be six men to a boat.

350
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,560
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}First drills are tomorrow. Six bells sharp.

351
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,430
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We're not even east of Halifax, sir.

352
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,850
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}What's your name?

353
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,810
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Coffin. Henry Coffin.

354
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,860
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}He's the Captain's cousin, sir.

355
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:08,440
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Well, well, Mr. Coffin.

356
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:11,400
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You think a whale knows if it's east of Halifax?

357
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:17,450
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I don't know who all of you are or how you got here.

358
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,080
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Some of you probably have felonies to hide and you're on the run.

359
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,880
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}That's fine. I don't give a damn.

360
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,500
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}But in return, you exist for one thing

361
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:28,960
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}and one thing only.

362
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,920
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}And that is whale oil.

363
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:35,470
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I intend to fill our 2,000 barrels and be home as quickly as possible.

364
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,600
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}And even when the weather is fine and there are no whales, Mr. Coffin,

365
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,140
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}we will lower the boats and practice all maneuvers

366
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,640
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}necessary in the capture of a whale.

367
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:47,270
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}And any man who is idle will find himself swimming home. Is that understood?

368
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,480
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Aye, sir.

369
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:53,990
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Greenhorn.

370
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:56,780
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}On deck.

371
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,660
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}On you go.

372
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,630
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Aye, aye, landsman.

373
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,590
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Thomas Nickerson, right? - Aye, sir.

374
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,340
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You know, some feel sick at first.

375
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,010
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Please, pull me back up!

376
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,510
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Best way to square it with King Neptune, boy!

377
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,390
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Please bring me up!

378
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,600
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Better now?

379
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,360
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Ah, shit.

380
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,610
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Sir, I am so sorry.

381
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,990
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Well, now you got something to write home to your mother about.

382
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:44,620
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}My mother's buried up in Smith's Hill.

383
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,750
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}There's a stone for my father, too.

384
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,840
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}He was lost at sea before I was born.

385
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:52,420
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Here, give me that.

386
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,510
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Well, this is your family now, boy.

387
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,720
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}For better or for worse.

388
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:03,140
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Worse, mostly.

389
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,480
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Swab the deck, kid.

390
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:27,580
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Dogwatch! You're gonna learn what it takes to be Whalers today, mates.

391
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:28,540
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Aye, sir!

392
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,380
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- You led that line wrong, Nickerson. - Aye, sir.

393
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,420
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- We'll stay at this till sundown if we have to. - Aye, Mr. Joy, sir!

394
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,920
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Main topsail leech lines!

395
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:37,630
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Harpooner, make ready to boat!

396
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,720
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Aye, sir! - Aye, Mr. Joy!

397
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:42,470
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Go main topsail leech lines. Too slow, you damn coofs!

398
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:43,970
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}The bailing piggins.

399
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,690
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You will learn every inch of this ship before you return to your bunks.

400
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,520
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Sweat that line, Barz.

401
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,570
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- You need to move quicker, Mr. Ray. - Aye, Mr. Chase.

402
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,950
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Ain't no greenhorns no more, Mr. Chase.

403
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,280
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You're a sailor now!

404
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,580
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Not bad, Mr. Ray. Well done.

405
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,000
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Forecourse bunts!

406
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,040
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Get used to it, lads. You're gonna work like horses.

407
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,290
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Chase?

408
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:13,790
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Sir.

409
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:16,090
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Set stunsails.

410
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,840
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Is that wise, sir? We're nearing the Gulf Stream. Best keep it five knots till we can see the weather.

411
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:23,050
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We are two days behind.

412
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,220
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We need to make up the time if we're to catch the easterlies.

413
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,680
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Set stunsails.

414
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,480
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Set stunsails. Come on, move. - Aye, Mr. Chase!

415
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,740
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Belay that! Set stunsails!

416
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,620
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Get aloft, Mr. Coffin. The captain wants speed.

417
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:45,870
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Look for braces, lads. Trim for speed.

418
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,790
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Set fore the main topsail and topgallant stunsails, men. Move it.

419
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,710
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Make fast your stunsail halyard.

420
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:56,300
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Make fast stunsail halyard, sir.

421
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,590
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Stunsail boom ready, sir!

422
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,720
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Bracing fore topsail, sir.

423
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,550
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Hey!

424
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:24,530
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- The captain's got us moving now! - We're finally getting somewhere!

425
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:27,950
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}She may be old, but she can still roll, boys!

426
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:41,800
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Sir, a squall on the starboard bow. We must shorten sail immediately.

427
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:43,970
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Not just yet, Mr. Chase.

428
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:47,810
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Sir, we are headed into a squall at more than 8 knots, and it's moving faster than that.

429
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:53,140
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Let it come. The men are soft from months on land. They need a good baptism. Let them know our work has begun.

430
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:59,320
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}If we don't shorten sail and bear off, it'll catch us on the beam.

431
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:00,320
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Chase,

432
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,740
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}we will stand on.

433
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,610
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Lawrence? Hold our course.

434
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,070
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Holding course, sir.

435
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,490
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We'll lose half a day running like that. We'll skirt the edge of it.

436
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,750
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}If the men can't handle a gust like this, then God help us all.

437
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,970
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Best secure for heavy weather.

438
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:29,180
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Rough weather coming up, boys. Get this deck secure.

439
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:37,940
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Double gripes on the boats!

440
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,780
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Best prepare for weather, Mr. Bond. We're headed into a squall.

441
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,490
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Secure the main hatch!

442
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,870
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}She's moving fast!

443
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,640
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We must fall off and run with it.

444
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,640
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We will stand on, Mr. Chase.

445
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:14,180
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Lawrence! Hold your course.

446
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:15,810
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Holding course, sir.

447
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,990
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Sea's coming aboard!

448
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,160
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Hold on!

449
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,990
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Shorten sail, Mr. Chase!

450
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,870
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Climb to weather and grab the shrouds!

451
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,670
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Climb to weather! Get to windward and hold on!

452
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,170
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We need to get those sails down!

453
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,500
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Go lee!

454
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,800
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Nickerson, hold fast!

455
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,550
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Hold steady lines!

456
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,440
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Hold fast!

457
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,400
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Turn the ship! Turn to leeward!

458
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,480
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}No! The damage is done!

459
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:06,530
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Strike topgallants. Let fly sheets! - No, turn the ship!

460
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,860
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Veer off, Mr. Lawrence.

461
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:11,200
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}It's too late! It's too goddamn late!

462
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:13,660
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- We'll be broadsided! - Turn this ship!

463
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,840
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Hold on! - Turn!

464
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:25,380
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Strike those damn topgallants!

465
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,510
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Hold on!

466
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,500
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Look out!

467
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,270
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Joy!

468
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:30,820
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- We have to cut away the topgallants! - Topgallants away!

469
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,530
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We have to get her upright!

470
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:28,420
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You wish to see me, sir?

471
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,800
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}At six bells tomorrow,

472
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,720
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}you will assemble the crew.

473
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:38,010
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Inform them that we will be returning to Nantucket for repairs.

474
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,930
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You will then apologize to them for interfering with a captain's order,

475
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,850
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}which nearly cost the lives of every man on this ship today.

476
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,190
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}What?

477
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:50,480
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I'll accept your resignation upon our return to port. That will be all.

478
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:54,110
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- It was your order to set stunsails, sir. - That decision was sound.

479
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:55,450
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}The men needed testing.

480
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:57,530
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- So you send them into a storm? - That...

481
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:01,120
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- That was unlucky. - No, it was bad seamanship.

482
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:03,620
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}And blaming misfortune is just plain weakness.

483
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,540
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Damn your impertinence!

484
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,710
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Do you know who you're speaking to?

485
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,880
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}My name is Captain George Pollard. Pollard!

486
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:19,050
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}And you, Mr. Chase, no matter how many whale pins you may have on your lapel,

487
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,310
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}are nothing more than the son of a farmer

488
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,770
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}who's managed to bully his way into an officer's tunic.

489
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:27,600
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Now get out.

490
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:35,530
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}To return to port without a single barrel of oil would be a mistake, sir.

491
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:38,660
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}And not behoove a man whose name is Pollard.

492
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:40,820
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Or Chase, for that matter.

493
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:45,410
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}And the best thing for both of us would be to work all hours God sends us,

494
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:48,250
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}fill this ship with oil and be home inside a year

495
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,830
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}and rid of one another as quickly as possible.

496
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:57,050
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Trust me, I am every bit as desirous of that as you.

497
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,680
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Of course, that is a captain's decision.

498
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:16,360
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}They were like an ill-married couple.

499
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,030
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}An ill-married couple will tolerate each other, Mr. Melville.

500
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,280
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}But an ill-married couple can also bring down a ship.

501
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,080
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Are you married, Mr. Melville?

502
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:27,960
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I am.

503
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,330
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}God have mercy on you.

504
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,040
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}First child on the way, too.

505
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:36,380
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}So, does your good wife know that you've brought all you have in the world here tonight

506
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,710
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}and given it to a stranger?

507
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,510
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}No, sir.

508
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,720
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You're full of surprises, aren't you?

509
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,560
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}So,

510
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:49,350
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}the Essex did not return to port.

511
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:50,730
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}She did not.

512
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:52,560
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}She continued out to sea.

513
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:53,400
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Yes, she did.

514
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:59,530
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}And before long, we heard that call that all whalemen pray for.

515
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:01,780
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}"Blows."

516
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,410
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Blows!

517
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:09,000
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}To windward! There she blows!

518
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,580
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Right or sperm, Mr. Ramsdell?

519
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:13,080
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Sperm whales they are!

520
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:14,880
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}There go the flukes!

521
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:17,960
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Chase! Hoist and swing boats.

522
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,260
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}All hands! All hands on deck!

523
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,090
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}All hands on deck!

524
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:27,430
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Away the boats.

525
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,520
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Lower away!

526
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,170
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Straight! Crack them backbones.

527
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,760
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Aye, sir!

528
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,970
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Give way all. Spring those oars till your arms fall off.

529
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,770
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}There they breach!

530
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:12,810
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Thataway, boys! Full pressure!

531
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,390
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Aye, sir!

532
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,060
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Come on! Put your back into it.

533
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:22,320
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Pull! Pull like a vengeance!

534
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:24,240
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}There she blows!

535
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,330
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}That's a calf.

536
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,330
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}That's the calf?

537
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,710
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}That's the cow.

538
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,760
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}And that's our boy! That's the money.

539
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,010
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Nickerson, push!

540
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:50,850
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Sorry, sir.

541
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:52,350
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Forty-barreler?

542
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:53,930
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Fifty.

543
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,230
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Oh, he's a buster!

544
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,110
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Bite the oars, lads.

545
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,280
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Blister your goddamn lungs!

546
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:04,530
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Full pressure! Smartly, lads! Smartly!

547
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,030
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mind your oars!

548
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,700
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Ramsdell, prepare the line.

549
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:10,870
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Aye, sir.

550
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:16,210
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Lawrence, the first one's mine.

551
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:19,880
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Take me to the pretty spot.

552
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,340
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Pull! Come on.

553
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,880
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Stay on him.

554
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,030
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You're on your first Nantucket sleigh ride, boy.

555
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,820
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Oh, my God!

556
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,920
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Look at him! The most fearsome creature ever to live on this Earth.

557
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:13,350
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}He sounds.

558
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,810
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}My hands!

559
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:27,400
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}LAWRENCE. We need to wet the line, Nickerson.

560
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:35,830
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Give way, lads. Give way.

561
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,790
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Got 140 fathoms of line left, Mr. Chase.

562
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:54,470
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Eighty fathoms of line left, sir!

563
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:00,980
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}He's gonna pull us under!

564
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,820
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Matthew, I need your line!

565
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,230
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Keep going!

566
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,530
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Peterson, give me the line.

567
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:08,900
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Aye, sir.

568
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:09,990
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Give me that line, Mr. Peterson.

569
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:13,370
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We're down to 60 fathoms of line left, sir!

570
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:16,740
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Twenty fathoms, Mr. Chase.

571
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:17,830
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Tie it off!

572
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,120
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Safe!

573
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,580
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Go!

574
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:38,010
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Peterson, lay out. - Aye, sir.

575
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,520
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}How many fathoms can he go?

576
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:43,560
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}70 fathoms left, sir.

577
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:48,110
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}No, no, no, wait.

578
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,450
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Owen!

579
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,990
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}No, no! Not yet! Don't touch that line!

580
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,910
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Down to 50 fathoms, sir.

581
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:02,370
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Owen, God damn it!

582
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:04,290
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I said don't touch it!

583
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,710
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}30 fathoms left, Mr. Joy.

584
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,880
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Ten fathoms left, sir!

585
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,420
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Backwater!

586
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,380
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Push!

587
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,850
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Chimney's afire!

588
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,430
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Chimney's afire!

589
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,430
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Afire!

590
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:36,840
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Hurry it along, lads.

591
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:40,470
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}God! Get out, you bastards.

592
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:58,200
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Blubber in the Oil. Smell that, boys!

593
00:42:58,660 --> 00:42:59,910
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}That's us making money!

594
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,160
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Get out of there, you sons of bitches.

595
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,460
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- There, you got it? - There's not a chance.

596
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,840
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- How's it looking? - It's not good.

597
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,970
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}That's it.

598
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,050
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Chase, sir.

599
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,260
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Yeah?

600
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:26,180
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}That's all of it, sir. We can't get any more out.

601
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:28,810
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}That's the gold in there, boys. Come on, keep digging.

602
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,730
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We're too big to wriggle down there.

603
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:32,480
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Then find someone who can.

604
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:40,240
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Nickerson! Come here, boy.

605
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,990
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Hey! I said come here.

606
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,330
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Climb on into him.

607
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:52,250
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Come on, Thomas.

608
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:56,050
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}What's in there is worth a hell of a lot more than what they're boiling down.

609
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:03,850
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Sir! I can't, I'm...

610
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:05,850
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I'm sorry. I can't.

611
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,930
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You get down there, or I'll have you sleep down there.

612
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:14,230
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You best put that between your teeth, boy.

613
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,940
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Stinks worse than the devil's asshole down there.

614
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:21,910
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Thanks.

615
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,290
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Sorry.

616
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:31,250
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Here, Nickerson, take my pillow with you.

617
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:34,880
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Down you go.

618
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:53,690
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}A man gets to know himself down there.

619
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:57,940
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}They ever send you into a whale's head?

620
00:44:58,190 --> 00:44:58,820
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}No.

621
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:01,150
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I was spared.

622
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:04,530
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Well, that's where the treasure is.

623
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,910
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I'll never forget that first bull.

624
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:14,460
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Forty-seven barrels. 'Course, the happiness was short-lived.

625
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:19,250
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- The waters there had all been fished out? - That they had.

626
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,760
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}So, we headed further out.

627
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:28,810
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Yeah. Took us a month to round the Horn.

628
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:33,890
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Left the South Atlantic behind with a sliver of hope

629
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:36,480
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}that things could change for the better.

630
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:41,280
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}But making the Pacific didn't improve our lot.

631
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:46,490
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Whale sightings were too damn scarce.

632
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:50,660
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}After nearly a year at sea,

633
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:54,910
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}the temperaments of our captain and first mate grew more strained.

634
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,670
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Captain Pollard spent most days and nights in his cabin,

635
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:02,920
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}afraid to look his crew in the eye.

636
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:10,640
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Our hold was almost empty.

637
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:14,480
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}And to gaze upon our paltry efforts

638
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:16,690
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}only served as a reminder

639
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:20,020
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}that we were a long way from going home.

640
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:46,550
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}No, no. I don't talk that talk. Speak English.

641
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,680
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Offer me more.

642
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:52,310
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Here, sir. This, Nantucket whale oil.

643
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,560
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Ain't no skinny hog worth more than that. - More!

644
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:53,780
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Capitan. Excuse me. The locals told me your voyage was waylaid, sir.

645
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,200
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Captain George Pollard. The Essex.

646
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:59,620
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Capitan Clemente Pelaez, the Santa Maria.

647
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,960
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Would you buy a colleague a drink?

648
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,630
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}No, no.

649
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:15,140
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Bad luck? How far out?

650
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,640
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Far enough for only a fool to go.

651
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:20,600
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}How far would that be?

652
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,060
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}A thousand leagues along the equator.

653
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,320
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}The Offshore Grounds.

654
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,280
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Were there whales there?

655
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,910
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}More than you've ever dreamed.

656
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:36,910
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Hundreds. Fields of flukes far as the eye can see.

657
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:40,250
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Could have filled up 3,000 barrels in the space of a day.

658
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:41,830
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}What do you mean, "could have"?

659
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:49,340
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}If it weren't for that demon.

660
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:51,760
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}A whale.

661
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:56,350
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}White as alabaster. Hundred feet long.

662
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:00,810
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Sent six of my crew to their graves.

663
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:13,110
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}And the rest of us, something to remember him by.

664
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:17,740
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Now, this white whale, did he dance a jig and pick your pocket as well?

665
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,120
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Gracias.

666
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,550
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You believe that?

667
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:34,220
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}If we set sail now,

668
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:39,260
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}catch the south easterlies at their best time and fill our belly, we could be home in six months.

669
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:42,890
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}What say you, Mr. Chase?

670
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:45,980
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}No need to endure our predicament for a moment longer than necessary.

671
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,650
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Amen to that.

672
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:49,320
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Amen.

673
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:54,820
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Greed took hold of our captain and first mate.

674
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:56,660
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}So we headed out.

675
00:49:57,370 --> 00:49:59,530
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}A thousand leagues along the equator.

676
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:02,080
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Where knowledge ended,

677
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,660
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}speculation began.

678
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:06,920
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}That's where the whales had gone to hide.

679
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:10,840
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}As far from man as they could possibly go.

680
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:13,050
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}But we hunted them down.

681
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:19,010
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Centuries before, sailors feared sailing off the edge of the Earth.

682
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:23,390
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}But we were headed for the edge of sanity.

683
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,730
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Trust gave way to doubt.

684
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:32,530
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Hope to blind superstition.

685
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:36,280
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Captain, the men are talking.

686
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:38,110
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}That's what men do.

687
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:40,830
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}They aren't happy with your decision to sail out this far.

688
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:46,790
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Well, did you correct them? Did you remind them of our purpose to fill this ship with whale oil,

689
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,920
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}and if the whales are 1,000 leagues out, that that is where we will go?

690
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,590
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Cousin, please.

691
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:56,800
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}This is madness.

692
00:50:57,970 --> 00:51:02,760
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You have let yourself be influenced by that man. You must turn this ship back.

693
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:07,600
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I suggest you go back down, reassure the men,

694
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:09,940
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}be a leader

695
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:14,570
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}and don't ever, ever abuse the privilege of family with me again.

696
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:18,320
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Coffin.

697
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:49,100
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}What is it?

698
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:50,810
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Listen.

699
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:52,060
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Chase?

700
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:53,230
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I see some white water.

701
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,650
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Where? - Portside!

702
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:56,360
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- We're away! - Portside, Captain!

703
00:51:56,570 --> 00:51:58,360
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Where are they? - You see anything?

704
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:06,990
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Lower away!

705
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:08,910
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Lower away! Lower away!

706
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:13,880
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}The devil take the Mexican grounds!

707
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:54,580
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Peak oars!

708
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,250
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Give it to him, Mr. Chappel!

709
00:52:58,630 --> 00:53:00,420
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Stick him, man! Stick him!

710
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:06,930
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Dead ahead, Peterson!

711
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:19,940
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Don't let him chew your oars, boys.

712
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:21,650
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Back to it.

713
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,140
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}The whale?

714
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,470
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Yes.

715
00:53:48,970 --> 00:53:49,930
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}So it's true?

716
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:51,430
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Yes.

717
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,640
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Too much is true.

718
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:55,940
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Get it up!

719
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:13,330
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Full pressure!

720
00:54:28,010 --> 00:54:29,220
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Bond!

721
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:31,510
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Back the foreyard, lower the tackle!

722
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:32,850
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Aye, sir!

723
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:35,850
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Here she comes, Peterson. Now, now!

724
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:52,870
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Lawrence, take us leeward, head us straight for the school.

725
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:53,660
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Aye, sir.

726
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:54,700
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Hot tar, sir.

727
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:55,870
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We'll find him.

728
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,420
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We're boat to black skin.

729
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:04,550
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Beach us on her!

730
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:15,850
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}She's ours, men!

731
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:49,760
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}What was that, Mr. Lawrence?

732
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,600
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Chase!

733
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:04,690
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}God damn it.

734
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:06,610
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Find Mr...

735
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,340
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Easton!

736
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:52,110
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Get Mr. Lawrence to man the pumps!

737
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,280
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Where is he?

738
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:56,200
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Port bow!

739
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:10,260
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Get me the biggest irons we have.

740
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:14,970
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}He wants a fight?

741
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:26,400
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Never seen a whale do that.

742
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:31,070
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Lawrence, take the wheel. Mr. Ramsdell, secure the other end of the line to the foremast.

743
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,030
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Aye, sir.

744
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,490
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}As I live and breathe, he's mine.

745
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,450
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Cut the line! - Look out!

746
00:59:16,630 --> 00:59:18,010
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Captain! - What?

747
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:20,640
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}The Essex! She's listing.

748
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:33,190
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Turn this boat around!

749
01:00:09,890 --> 01:00:11,350
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Help me! Mr. Joy! - Nickerson!

750
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:13,690
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Here! Give me your hand! - Help!

751
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:15,110
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Nickerson!

752
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:52,730
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Chase!

753
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:58,110
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}A whale, sir. It stove the ship.

754
01:00:58,900 --> 01:00:59,740
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}What?

755
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:02,400
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We lost Easton and Sanborn.

756
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:06,910
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}The pumps are useless, sir.

757
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:15,790
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Prepare to abandon ship.

758
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,460
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We can't row our way home.

759
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:20,840
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We'll have to strip her of her sails and jimmy-rig something.

760
01:01:21,090 --> 01:01:23,800
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Gather as much food and water as you can carry.

761
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:26,140
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We're gonna need all the fresh water you can find.

762
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,430
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Nickerson, you grab as much as you can. Barz, come with me.

763
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,730
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Sweet Lord!

764
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:38,070
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}First, the sails, then the provisions.

765
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:43,070
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Get as much food as you can carry, lad.

766
01:01:44,610 --> 01:01:45,910
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Make haste, boys!

767
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:49,120
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Nickerson, there are more casks in steerage.

768
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:49,990
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Got it?

769
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:53,000
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Hardtack is dry. Move sprightly, gentlemen.

770
01:01:53,290 --> 01:01:54,370
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Lower away!

771
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:56,170
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Take those tack lines. - Up aloft!

772
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:58,500
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Lower away! Bring it down! - Mr. Cole, get that yard down.

773
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:00,380
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Bring it down. Keep it coming!

774
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:02,510
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Hold off!

775
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:11,810
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Come on, Nickerson!

776
01:02:11,970 --> 01:02:12,810
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Get those sails!

777
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:16,150
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}There you go.

778
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:20,480
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Get that yard down!

779
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:25,150
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We need the sails. Not enough water.

780
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:32,120
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Get the barrels, now!

781
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:34,750
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Strip that rigging!

782
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,620
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}More fresh water! More hardtack! Come on!

783
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:38,710
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I can see more casks in the steerage!

784
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:41,340
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Benjamin! Quick! Come on!

785
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:42,800
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Give me your hand! - Get him up.

786
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:44,300
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I got you.

787
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:45,550
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Hardtack!

788
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,680
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Come on! Move it!

789
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,010
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Step lively, Mr. Nickerson!

790
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:57,640
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Gotta get away from the oil!

791
01:02:57,850 --> 01:02:59,150
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}She's going down! She's listing!

792
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,730
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Where's Owen? Nickerson, where is Mr. Chase?

793
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:03,320
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}He was just here, sir.

794
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:04,860
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Come on, hurry up!

795
01:03:05,070 --> 01:03:05,860
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Owen!

796
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:07,450
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Mr. Chase! - We gotta shove off!

797
01:03:08,530 --> 01:03:09,320
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Come on, now, boys!

798
01:03:09,530 --> 01:03:10,910
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Oil on deck!

799
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:14,540
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Captain! - Mr. Chase!

800
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,060
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Chase, sir!

801
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:37,890
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Owen!

802
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:39,900
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Where is the first mate?

803
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:51,700
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}She's gonna blow!

804
01:03:51,950 --> 01:03:52,990
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Owen! - We gotta move!

805
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:55,040
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}No, wait! Wait!

806
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:56,790
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Chase, sir!

807
01:03:58,370 --> 01:03:59,710
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Chase!

808
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:46,800
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}There he is! There he is! There he is!

809
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:50,970
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Chase!

810
01:04:53,470 --> 01:04:54,760
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Move that!

811
01:04:55,470 --> 01:04:57,810
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Chase, sir. Here!

812
01:04:58,350 --> 01:05:00,600
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Get ahold, now. We got you.

813
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:03,190
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Sir. - You're all right now, Mr. Chase.

814
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:09,150
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Going fishing, are we?

815
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:11,450
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Clean and load it, Mr. Joy.

816
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:26,290
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Back away, or she'll take us down with her.

817
01:07:10,110 --> 01:07:11,110
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Captain.

818
01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:13,360
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}What about our provisions?

819
01:07:19,990 --> 01:07:22,280
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Two ounces of hardtack a day per man.

820
01:07:23,450 --> 01:07:25,160
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}And half a cup of water.

821
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,330
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Hey, man, we can't live on that.

822
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:32,040
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Not for more than a few days.

823
01:07:49,310 --> 01:07:50,520
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}It's he.

824
01:07:55,650 --> 01:07:57,320
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Yeah, it's him, all right.

825
01:08:00,530 --> 01:08:02,530
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You don't fool me, Mr. Chase.

826
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:04,490
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Coffin?

827
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:05,540
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}That right?

828
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:09,290
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You put us here. You know you put us here.

829
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:12,540
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Hey! Put it down! - Mr. Coffin, put the pistol down.

830
01:08:12,790 --> 01:08:13,630
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Say you're scared!

831
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,800
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- What are you doing? - Mr. Coffin, put the pistol down.

832
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,170
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You know what happens when the food and water runs out?

833
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:20,180
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Do as the captain says, Coffin!

834
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:22,390
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- I just wanna see the landsman scared. - Mr. Coffin, put the pistol down.

835
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:25,140
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- That's an order! - Do as the captain says! Now.

836
01:08:25,350 --> 01:08:26,010
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Say it!

837
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:27,310
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Henry. - Say it!

838
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:29,480
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Say it!

839
01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:30,940
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Henry!

840
01:08:31,390 --> 01:08:33,020
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Put the pistol down.

841
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:38,530
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Henry!

842
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:40,700
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Put it down.

843
01:09:17,190 --> 01:09:18,860
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}So east it was.

844
01:09:19,730 --> 01:09:21,950
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Back in the direction we'd come.

845
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:25,910
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Though only the sun and compass told us so.

846
01:09:26,910 --> 01:09:28,910
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}All directions looked the same.

847
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:32,580
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Our hope was to catch the Westerlies to Easter Island.

848
01:09:34,210 --> 01:09:36,040
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}A journey of 3,000 miles.

849
01:09:37,630 --> 01:09:39,420
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}In 12 days, we have drifted south.

850
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:42,050
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Six degrees latitude.

851
01:09:42,630 --> 01:09:45,470
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We're not one mile closer to Easter Island.

852
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:47,720
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We stayed in the same place.

853
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:52,430
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We are cursed.

854
01:09:52,770 --> 01:09:55,310
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We'll make up for it when we catch the variables.

855
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,770
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We'll catch them.

856
01:10:29,890 --> 01:10:30,930
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Chappel!

857
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:33,310
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Chappel!

858
01:10:33,810 --> 01:10:34,600
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Chappel!

859
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:36,440
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You've got him, Captain!

860
01:10:42,110 --> 01:10:44,150
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Joy, the halyard's jammed!

861
01:10:47,780 --> 01:10:48,700
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Joy!

862
01:10:49,450 --> 01:10:51,080
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You all right, Mr. Joy?

863
01:10:54,830 --> 01:10:56,250
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Grab the tiller!

864
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,710
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Grab it! - Matthew!

865
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,210
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Get that sail down!

866
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:36,330
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Matthew. Hey, what happened? What happened?

867
01:11:36,710 --> 01:11:38,500
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Owen. What are you doing here?

868
01:11:38,710 --> 01:11:40,000
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Let me take a look. - No, no, no.

869
01:11:40,210 --> 01:11:41,130
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Lay still. Let me look.

870
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:43,210
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Owen, I'm fine. All right. - Just relax. Relax. Let me take a look.

871
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:45,670
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- I'm fine! - I know. I know. I just wanna take a look.

872
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:53,260
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I banged my head. Just a scratch, all right?

873
01:11:53,470 --> 01:11:54,680
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Just a scratch. - Give him some water.

874
01:11:54,970 --> 01:11:55,890
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I don't need any water!

875
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:57,850
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Give him some goddamn water!

876
01:11:58,060 --> 01:12:00,730
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}No, no, no. I don't need water. I'm fine.

877
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,070
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Take that. Take it.

878
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:12,490
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Hey. I got you, I got you.

879
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:15,040
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You're all right. You're all right.

880
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:22,920
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Hey! What're you all looking at? I'm fine.

881
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:25,170
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Captain Pollard. Fit as a fiddle.

882
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,210
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Fit as a goddamned fiddle. You hear me?

883
01:12:29,050 --> 01:12:30,090
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Owen. - Yeah.

884
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:33,300
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I'm fine. All right? I'm fine!

885
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:36,010
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- You're a tough son of a bitch. - Thank you. I'm fine.

886
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:37,470
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Get out of here.

887
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:39,930
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}He's good.

888
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:42,150
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Let's go.

889
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:46,360
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Why waste water on a dead man?

890
01:12:46,730 --> 01:12:49,070
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Them two men have known each other,

891
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:51,740
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}sailed together since childhood.

892
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:56,120
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Now, tell me, could you sit there and watch your own brother die?

893
01:12:56,870 --> 01:12:59,410
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Simply a matter of numbers, Mr. Chappel.

894
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:02,750
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}There's not enough for all of us.

895
01:13:14,510 --> 01:13:17,220
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Why waste water on a dead man?

896
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:19,720
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Why waste water on...

897
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:22,980
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Why waste water? Why waste?

898
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:25,810
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Why waste water on a dead man?

899
01:13:26,230 --> 01:13:27,610
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Nickerson?

900
01:13:28,860 --> 01:13:29,730
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Why waste water...

901
01:13:30,070 --> 01:13:30,940
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You all right, sir?

902
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:33,070
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I cannot.

903
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:34,450
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Cannot what?

904
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:36,030
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}No, you...

905
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:38,410
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You have enough. More than enough.

906
01:13:38,620 --> 01:13:40,160
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}But, sir, we've come so far.

907
01:13:40,370 --> 01:13:41,700
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We have come to an end.

908
01:13:41,910 --> 01:13:43,160
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We have an agreement, sir.

909
01:13:43,370 --> 01:13:46,500
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Take the money and leave! The devil's bargain.

910
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:50,670
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}No, sir. The devil loves unspoken secrets.

911
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:56,590
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Especially those that fester in a man's soul.

912
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:00,140
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}What's yours?

913
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:21,200
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I am not a great writer.

914
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:25,920
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I am not Hawthorne.

915
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,250
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}But from my first hearing of it,

916
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,050
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}this tale has haunted me.

917
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:35,220
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}It consumes me.

918
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:38,760
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I fear if I do not write it,

919
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:42,270
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}then I should never write again.

920
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:44,930
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}What else?

921
01:14:46,850 --> 01:14:48,860
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I fear if I do write it,

922
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:53,110
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}that it will not be as good as it should be.

923
01:15:03,450 --> 01:15:05,410
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Continue the story, sir.

924
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:08,040
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}For the both of us.

925
01:15:24,850 --> 01:15:25,890
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Pass that down.

926
01:15:31,230 --> 01:15:32,570
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Thank you, sir.

927
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:40,870
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We thank you, Lord, for this is our food.

928
01:15:41,490 --> 01:15:42,280
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I'm sorry.

929
01:15:42,490 --> 01:15:46,620
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}For life and health, and every good.

930
01:15:46,830 --> 01:15:47,710
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Let all manner to...

931
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:50,330
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Land. Land!

932
01:15:51,790 --> 01:15:53,880
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Land! Land! - Land!

933
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:55,170
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Land!

934
01:15:55,380 --> 01:15:56,630
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Land!

935
01:15:57,010 --> 01:16:00,260
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Oars! Give way! Give way!

936
01:16:01,010 --> 01:16:02,930
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Oars! Now! Give way!

937
01:16:03,140 --> 01:16:04,560
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Row!

938
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:14,400
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- I saw it, Mr. Chase. - That you did, boy.

939
01:16:24,030 --> 01:16:27,120
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Hold fast. Hold fast! Hold fast!

940
01:16:28,410 --> 01:16:29,870
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Chase, sir. What is it?

941
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:33,880
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Chase! What the devil is it? Why have you stopped?

942
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:35,500
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}He's been following us!

943
01:16:35,710 --> 01:16:37,670
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}What is he talking about?

944
01:16:38,130 --> 01:16:40,930
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}There's nothing out there, Mr. Chase! There ain't nothing out there, sir!

945
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:42,300
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Sir, what are you doing?

946
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:57,530
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Brace! Brace! Brace!

947
01:17:00,150 --> 01:17:01,200
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}No!

948
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:26,300
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Where is he?

949
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:30,510
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}This could be Ducie Island.

950
01:19:30,930 --> 01:19:33,850
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Without a map, compass or quadrant, there's no way to be certain.

951
01:19:34,350 --> 01:19:36,680
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We will keep fires going night and day.

952
01:19:37,230 --> 01:19:40,480
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Hope a passing ship catches sight of our smoke.

953
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:39,120
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}This is what I wanted you to see.

954
01:20:47,590 --> 01:20:50,050
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}They've been here a long time, no doubt.

955
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:52,720
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Waiting for a ship.

956
01:20:53,550 --> 01:20:55,300
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}But no ship came.

957
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:59,640
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}No ship is going to come.

958
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:01,850
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}If we stay, we die.

959
01:21:02,690 --> 01:21:07,570
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}How long do you think it'll take the tropic birds to stop coming here once they see their eggs eaten?

960
01:21:26,380 --> 01:21:30,130
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}It's a privilege to know the moment of one's death in advance,

961
01:21:30,550 --> 01:21:32,510
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}be able to prepare for it.

962
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:36,260
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Curse to be so far from home

963
01:21:38,010 --> 01:21:41,980
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}without a chance to say goodbyes, without a chance to make peace,

964
01:21:42,690 --> 01:21:45,230
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}without a chance to settle the scores.

965
01:21:47,980 --> 01:21:51,990
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Then let us at least settle those between us, Captain.

966
01:21:54,570 --> 01:21:56,120
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Captain of what?

967
01:21:56,570 --> 01:21:59,410
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}The Essex was lost through no fault of yours.

968
01:21:59,660 --> 01:22:02,500
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- I was as much to blame for... - You are not the captain.

969
01:22:07,540 --> 01:22:09,920
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}But you were born to do this job.

970
01:22:10,710 --> 01:22:12,800
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I was just born into it.

971
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:27,730
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}What do we do, do you think, George?

972
01:22:29,150 --> 01:22:32,820
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}And what offense did we give God to upset him so?

973
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:36,200
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}The only creature to have offended God here is the whale.

974
01:22:37,030 --> 01:22:38,370
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Not us?

975
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:43,540
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}In our arrogance, our greed, look where we find ourselves.

976
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:47,080
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We are supreme creatures made in God's own likeness.

977
01:22:47,710 --> 01:22:49,380
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Earthly kings

978
01:22:49,590 --> 01:22:53,340
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}whose business it is to circumnavigate the planet bestowed to us.

979
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:56,010
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}To bend nature to our will.

980
01:22:56,340 --> 01:22:59,720
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You really feel like an earthly king after everything that we've been through?

981
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:02,520
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We're nothing. We're...

982
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:05,810
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We're specks. And dust.

983
01:23:06,890 --> 01:23:09,270
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We sail into the sun at dawn.

984
01:23:10,230 --> 01:23:11,940
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}If we are to die,

985
01:23:12,190 --> 01:23:14,030
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}then with God's grace,

986
01:23:14,860 --> 01:23:16,530
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}let us die as men.

987
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:29,710
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Are we ready, Mr. Weeks?

988
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:30,920
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Aye, sir.

989
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:40,590
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Chappel? Mr. Wright?

990
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:42,930
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I can't do it, sir.

991
01:23:43,930 --> 01:23:45,600
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Me, Wrights and Weeks,

992
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:48,310
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}we're staying.

993
01:23:56,610 --> 01:23:58,450
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You ready to go, Matthew?

994
01:24:09,620 --> 01:24:12,000
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- I'll give you a hand. Here, you gotta get up. - No, there's no point.

995
01:24:12,210 --> 01:24:14,340
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- You hear me? - No, we're going home. We're going home.

996
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:16,010
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}There's no point.

997
01:24:16,710 --> 01:24:17,840
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Just go.

998
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:24,260
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}God damn it, Matthew.

999
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:28,270
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}It's all right.

1000
01:24:29,350 --> 01:24:31,850
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Well, I'll send a boat for you the minute we get back.

1001
01:24:32,060 --> 01:24:34,440
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Then we'll play cards back in Nantucket, all right?

1002
01:24:34,650 --> 01:24:35,610
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Yeah.

1003
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:37,740
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- It's a deal. - Good.

1004
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:46,240
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You want me to open that for you?

1005
01:24:50,250 --> 01:24:52,330
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I think I'll manage.

1006
01:24:53,170 --> 01:24:54,670
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}If it comes to that.

1007
01:24:58,550 --> 01:25:00,260
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}God be with you, brother.

1008
01:25:02,010 --> 01:25:03,430
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Yeah, and you.

1009
01:25:22,530 --> 01:25:24,070
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Brother Peterson?

1010
01:25:25,450 --> 01:25:27,080
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Y'all coming with us?

1011
01:25:27,830 --> 01:25:31,460
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Peterson. Why don't you come in our boat with Mr. Bond here?

1012
01:26:04,570 --> 01:26:06,410
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Where... Where is he?

1013
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:09,540
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Pollard?

1014
01:26:10,660 --> 01:26:12,410
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Lawrence. Mr. Lawrence, wake up.

1015
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:16,670
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Where's the other boat gone?

1016
01:26:17,330 --> 01:26:18,250
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Pollard!

1017
01:26:18,420 --> 01:26:20,210
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Captain Pollard! - Captain Pollard!

1018
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:22,050
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Captain Pollard, sir!

1019
01:26:22,420 --> 01:26:24,050
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Pollard. - Captain!

1020
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:26,680
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Captain Pollard!

1021
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:30,930
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Pollard!

1022
01:26:35,350 --> 01:26:36,730
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}What's the matter?

1023
01:26:52,580 --> 01:26:54,000
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Benjamin. What are you doing?

1024
01:26:54,750 --> 01:26:56,080
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}He's dead.

1025
01:26:56,750 --> 01:26:58,130
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Putting him overboard, sir.

1026
01:27:00,590 --> 01:27:03,210
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Look at me. Look at me, Benjamin.

1027
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:12,430
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}No right-minded sailor discards what might yet save him.

1028
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:25,030
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Listen to me, boy. Listen to me.

1029
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:31,490
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}He can help us.

1030
01:27:31,990 --> 01:27:33,830
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}My God. My heavenly king.

1031
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:36,960
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Sweetness is the power of his grace.

1032
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:39,170
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}With longing eyes,

1033
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:42,460
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}thy creatures await on thee for daily food.

1034
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,670
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}My soul is dead.

1035
01:27:59,850 --> 01:28:01,860
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}So it was decided.

1036
01:28:09,110 --> 01:28:10,990
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We prepared the body.

1037
01:28:13,990 --> 01:28:16,040
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We removed the organs.

1038
01:28:18,620 --> 01:28:21,380
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Separated his limbs from his body

1039
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:25,670
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}and cut all the flesh from the bones.

1040
01:28:30,010 --> 01:28:31,340
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}After which,

1041
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:34,180
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}we closed the body

1042
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:36,970
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}and we sewed it up

1043
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:39,640
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}as decently as we could

1044
01:28:40,230 --> 01:28:42,350
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}and committed it to the sea.

1045
01:28:44,570 --> 01:28:46,690
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We ate the heart first.

1046
01:28:54,990 --> 01:28:56,540
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You judge me.

1047
01:28:58,750 --> 01:28:59,750
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}No.

1048
01:29:06,210 --> 01:29:07,380
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}There.

1049
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:09,380
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}There.

1050
01:29:10,510 --> 01:29:11,880
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}It is done.

1051
01:29:14,260 --> 01:29:15,680
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}It is out.

1052
01:29:17,510 --> 01:29:19,270
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}And you've never told anyone?

1053
01:29:21,770 --> 01:29:22,770
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}No.

1054
01:29:24,770 --> 01:29:25,940
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Not even your wife?

1055
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:29,530
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Do you think she could ever love me

1056
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:32,700
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}if she knew the abominations I had committed?

1057
01:29:32,910 --> 01:29:34,990
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Yes. She would.

1058
01:29:36,780 --> 01:29:39,950
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}And if you had told me the story when we met,

1059
01:29:40,450 --> 01:29:43,580
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I would still wear your ring today.

1060
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:49,130
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}The strength of that boy still lives in you.

1061
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:52,470
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I see that.

1062
01:29:53,630 --> 01:29:55,640
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Even if you don't.

1063
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:19,660
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You can finish your story now, my love.

1064
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:36,720
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Hey, sit up.

1065
01:30:40,180 --> 01:30:41,180
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Listen,

1066
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:43,930
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}put your head back.

1067
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:49,060
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Look, we still got a few drops of water left.

1068
01:30:49,690 --> 01:30:52,480
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Don't you quit on me. We're going home.

1069
01:30:57,990 --> 01:31:01,870
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Do you have a family back home, Mr. Chase?

1070
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:03,700
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Yeah, I have a wife.

1071
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:09,880
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Yes, and a son or a daughter.

1072
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:55,960
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Very well.

1073
01:31:58,050 --> 01:31:59,180
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Captain.

1074
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:00,260
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We will draw again.

1075
01:32:00,550 --> 01:32:02,260
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We will do no such thing.

1076
01:32:03,390 --> 01:32:04,260
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We'll draw again.

1077
01:32:04,930 --> 01:32:06,680
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Ramsdell,

1078
01:32:07,180 --> 01:32:09,100
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}you will assume command of this vessel.

1079
01:32:11,730 --> 01:32:13,110
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Cousin, will you?

1080
01:32:15,940 --> 01:32:18,450
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You're our... You're our captain. The men need you.

1081
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:21,950
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}The men will be fine.

1082
01:32:22,870 --> 01:32:24,120
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Please.

1083
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:26,250
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Please. Please.

1084
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:28,790
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Henry. - Let us draw again.

1085
01:32:29,250 --> 01:32:31,080
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}It is an order.

1086
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:36,420
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}If you cannot do it, pass the pistol to another man.

1087
01:33:04,070 --> 01:33:05,660
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Henry, no, no, no!

1088
01:33:15,420 --> 01:33:18,090
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You gotta help me, kid. You gotta help me.

1089
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:23,680
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We were weeks in the doldrums.

1090
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:26,850
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}That part of the Pacific is more desert than ocean.

1091
01:33:27,510 --> 01:33:29,770
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}The sun beating down.

1092
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:31,690
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}My fear.

1093
01:33:33,350 --> 01:33:35,110
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}All I could think about

1094
01:33:36,690 --> 01:33:40,320
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}was that everyone would die, and I'd be the last left alive.

1095
01:33:41,610 --> 01:33:45,990
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}And as best Mr. Chase could tell, we were still 800 miles from land.

1096
01:33:51,710 --> 01:33:52,660
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Chase.

1097
01:34:01,380 --> 01:34:03,050
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Captain Pollard.

1098
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:07,050
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I am happy to see you.

1099
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:10,890
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Been very little happiness in our survival.

1100
01:34:12,310 --> 01:34:14,520
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Or in ours, sir.

1101
01:34:15,060 --> 01:34:15,940
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Barzillai?

1102
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:20,150
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}The third boat?

1103
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:23,490
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}They've, uh...

1104
01:34:24,740 --> 01:34:29,370
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}They've been gone for days. I'm afraid they're lost, sir.

1105
01:34:58,610 --> 01:35:00,860
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Chase, you have the best position.

1106
01:35:17,790 --> 01:35:19,290
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}It's just a whale.

1107
01:35:23,210 --> 01:35:24,460
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}He's there! Throw the lance!

1108
01:35:26,050 --> 01:35:26,720
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Throw it!

1109
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:33,140
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Throw it! Throw the lance!

1110
01:35:33,470 --> 01:35:34,810
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Come on.

1111
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:46,570
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Throw it!

1112
01:35:47,610 --> 01:35:48,950
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Come on.

1113
01:35:57,080 --> 01:36:01,000
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Kill it! He's there! Throw the lance!

1114
01:36:19,350 --> 01:36:21,440
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Why didn't you kill it?

1115
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:49,800
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You're a damn fool.

1116
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:15,370
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Currents drew us apart

1117
01:37:16,740 --> 01:37:20,250
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}and that was the last we would see of Captain Pollard's whale boat.

1118
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:24,670
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}A boat!

1119
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:27,670
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Broad on the port bow!

1120
01:37:53,070 --> 01:37:55,030
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}May God have mercy.

1121
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:38,580
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Chase.

1122
01:38:42,330 --> 01:38:43,580
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Father!

1123
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:47,250
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Don't leave me, Father!

1124
01:39:38,050 --> 01:39:39,390
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Chase.

1125
01:39:40,850 --> 01:39:41,720
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Chase.

1126
01:39:42,220 --> 01:39:45,060
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Sir, look. Look, sir.

1127
01:39:48,650 --> 01:39:49,980
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Chase,

1128
01:39:50,730 --> 01:39:51,900
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}look.

1129
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:56,820
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Wake up, Mr. Chase! Here, wake up!

1130
01:39:58,240 --> 01:40:00,450
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Please wake up, sir, there's land.

1131
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:03,030
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Chase, look.

1132
01:40:23,010 --> 01:40:24,930
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We were rescued there,

1133
01:40:25,100 --> 01:40:28,100
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}off the island of Mas Afuera, Chile,

1134
01:40:28,850 --> 01:40:31,770
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}90 days after the sinking of the Essex.

1135
01:40:33,270 --> 01:40:37,240
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}They gave us some old clothes. Fed us, too.

1136
01:40:38,360 --> 01:40:41,450
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}It was hard to eat at first. Strange.

1137
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:45,200
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}They looked after us as best they could

1138
01:40:45,410 --> 01:40:48,080
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}till we found a ship that would carry us home.

1139
01:40:49,290 --> 01:40:51,460
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}That voyage took another three months.

1140
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:04,140
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}It looked like the whole island turned out to see us return.

1141
01:41:05,310 --> 01:41:07,310
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}But there were no cheers.

1142
01:41:08,140 --> 01:41:09,810
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Only silence.

1143
01:41:11,060 --> 01:41:13,060
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}They looked at us like we were

1144
01:41:13,270 --> 01:41:14,940
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}apparitions,

1145
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:16,980
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}phantoms.

1146
01:41:17,780 --> 01:41:21,280
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We'd said nothing of the details of our survival to anyone,

1147
01:41:21,990 --> 01:41:25,330
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}but I wondered if they somehow knew of our privations.

1148
01:41:26,990 --> 01:41:28,830
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Maybe they were just curious.

1149
01:42:07,870 --> 01:42:09,990
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Oh, my God!

1150
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,800
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I promised, didn't I?

1151
01:42:26,970 --> 01:42:28,350
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Oh, God.

1152
01:42:29,720 --> 01:42:30,720
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Hi.

1153
01:42:32,020 --> 01:42:34,020
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Hey, sweetie. Who's this?

1154
01:42:35,230 --> 01:42:36,600
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Phoebe Ann.

1155
01:42:40,820 --> 01:42:43,030
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Phoebe Ann Chase, huh?

1156
01:42:43,900 --> 01:42:45,410
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}This is Daddy.

1157
01:42:47,070 --> 01:42:48,910
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Hey, sweetie.

1158
01:42:53,870 --> 01:42:55,420
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}It's your daddy.

1159
01:43:03,050 --> 01:43:04,760
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Oh, my God.

1160
01:43:12,890 --> 01:43:14,520
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Of course, they couldn't leave him alone.

1161
01:43:15,350 --> 01:43:18,440
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Chase and his wife had scarcely walked a block towards home

1162
01:43:18,610 --> 01:43:21,820
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}when he was stopped and made to return to the Maritime office.

1163
01:43:23,030 --> 01:43:26,400
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}There were business matters still in question.

1164
01:43:39,630 --> 01:43:41,420
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}So, to the matter.

1165
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:49,800
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Due to the significant loss of life and property on our voyage,

1166
01:43:50,090 --> 01:43:52,100
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}it seems there will be an inquiry.

1167
01:43:52,810 --> 01:43:57,480
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}And as captain and first mate, we will be expected to give an account of what happened.

1168
01:43:57,730 --> 01:43:59,060
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Yes, of course.

1169
01:43:59,310 --> 01:44:02,320
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}And having discussed this with the ship owners

1170
01:44:02,730 --> 01:44:04,150
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}and my father,

1171
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:08,820
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}it is clear that full disclosure will have ramifications.

1172
01:44:09,070 --> 01:44:11,990
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Terrible ramifications for the whole industry.

1173
01:44:12,780 --> 01:44:15,330
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}That a whale brought down the Essex.

1174
01:44:16,450 --> 01:44:17,960
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}But it's the truth.

1175
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:29,180
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}If the insurance houses and investors were to start worrying about

1176
01:44:30,180 --> 01:44:32,220
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}sea monsters sinking ships,

1177
01:44:33,010 --> 01:44:35,850
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}sailors drawing lots to survive...

1178
01:44:36,980 --> 01:44:38,980
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We are in the oil business.

1179
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:40,600
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}All of us.

1180
01:44:41,270 --> 01:44:46,320
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}And as in any business, the probability of success must always be greater than the risk incurred.

1181
01:44:48,530 --> 01:44:50,280
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}So, what are you suggesting, George?

1182
01:44:50,490 --> 01:44:52,780
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}That you say the ship ran aground.

1183
01:44:54,030 --> 01:44:54,700
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}That's a lie.

1184
01:44:54,870 --> 01:44:56,660
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}And that the men that died, drowned.

1185
01:44:57,120 --> 01:44:58,370
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}And that's another lie.

1186
01:44:58,710 --> 01:45:02,170
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Think on it. They will make you captain. - Well, that pledge I already have in writing.

1187
01:45:02,380 --> 01:45:06,300
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Only on the condition you bring home a ship full of oil.

1188
01:45:07,880 --> 01:45:09,380
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}This way, it's guaranteed.

1189
01:45:09,550 --> 01:45:11,880
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You would be a wealthy man.

1190
01:45:12,050 --> 01:45:16,390
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}The name Chase need no longer be a landsman's name, but an established name

1191
01:45:16,640 --> 01:45:19,640
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}that belongs among the great families of Nantucket.

1192
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:23,100
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You want me to whitewash what happened for profit?

1193
01:45:23,730 --> 01:45:27,230
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}We are asking you to be pragmatic.

1194
01:45:42,500 --> 01:45:45,080
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}The Essex was stove by a white whale.

1195
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:50,760
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}And those of us that survived in ill-equipped whaleboats had to commit abominations

1196
01:45:51,050 --> 01:45:52,180
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}in order to survive.

1197
01:45:53,090 --> 01:45:57,350
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}And, on our return, we're expected to spread barefaced lies

1198
01:45:57,930 --> 01:46:00,270
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}so that you, the ship owners of Nantucket,

1199
01:46:01,180 --> 01:46:03,520
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}might line your pockets and sleep well at night?

1200
01:46:05,270 --> 01:46:07,860
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Well, I will not embroider the truth.

1201
01:46:08,610 --> 01:46:10,530
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Nor should you, George.

1202
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:31,590
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}That last time I saw him...

1203
01:46:32,220 --> 01:46:33,800
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Chase, sir!

1204
01:46:34,380 --> 01:46:37,720
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I couldn't find the right words to say what I wanted to.

1205
01:46:38,470 --> 01:46:39,430
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Thomas.

1206
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:42,640
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Perhaps there are no words.

1207
01:46:44,980 --> 01:46:48,310
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I'm gonna be on my way to Falmouth and...

1208
01:46:51,150 --> 01:46:52,440
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}It's...

1209
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:56,910
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}It's been an honor, sir, to sail with you.

1210
01:47:00,830 --> 01:47:03,330
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}The honor's been mine, Mr. Nickerson.

1211
01:47:20,510 --> 01:47:21,470
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Here.

1212
01:47:26,940 --> 01:47:28,860
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Good luck out there, Thomas.

1213
01:47:30,020 --> 01:47:31,520
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}And you, sir.

1214
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:03,720
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Next day, George Pollard was called before the inquiry.

1215
01:48:08,310 --> 01:48:10,060
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Gentlemen, Captain George Pollard.

1216
01:48:11,150 --> 01:48:13,230
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}And all the important men in Nantucket were there.

1217
01:48:14,820 --> 01:48:16,070
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}It was a formality.

1218
01:48:17,820 --> 01:48:19,530
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Good day to you, Captain. Please sit down.

1219
01:48:25,700 --> 01:48:27,370
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}For the record, then...

1220
01:48:29,420 --> 01:48:32,000
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}The Essex was stove by a white whale

1221
01:48:32,210 --> 01:48:34,710
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}1,200 leagues west of Ecuador.

1222
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:38,260
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}It was as if Owen Chase himself had spoken.

1223
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:41,430
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Told them the truth.

1224
01:48:45,260 --> 01:48:47,770
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Captain Pollard's conscience was clear.

1225
01:48:48,940 --> 01:48:50,390
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}But the inquiry was a sham.

1226
01:48:52,940 --> 01:48:54,230
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Pollard went out again,

1227
01:48:57,400 --> 01:48:59,200
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}looking for the white whale.

1228
01:48:59,780 --> 01:49:01,450
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}He never found it.

1229
01:49:02,700 --> 01:49:05,450
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}He ran a second ship aground off Hawaii.

1230
01:49:06,450 --> 01:49:08,080
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Twice cursed.

1231
01:49:09,460 --> 01:49:10,790
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Never sailed again.

1232
01:49:11,120 --> 01:49:12,460
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}And Owen Chase?

1233
01:49:14,250 --> 01:49:16,130
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}He was a man of his word.

1234
01:49:16,750 --> 01:49:19,800
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}First, he sent a boat back to Ducie Island.

1235
01:49:20,550 --> 01:49:22,300
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Joy had passed.

1236
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:26,640
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}But the other three were, incredibly, still alive.

1237
01:49:29,060 --> 01:49:30,140
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}And then?

1238
01:49:30,980 --> 01:49:34,810
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}And then he packed up his family and moved to New Bedford.

1239
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:37,980
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Started over.

1240
01:49:38,650 --> 01:49:40,490
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Became a merchant captain,

1241
01:49:40,990 --> 01:49:43,450
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}sailing on his own terms.

1242
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:55,840
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Well, you certainly got your money's worth, Mr. Melville.

1243
01:49:56,090 --> 01:49:58,500
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}These February nights are the longest of the year.

1244
01:49:58,750 --> 01:50:00,210
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Well, you can both rest now.

1245
01:50:00,510 --> 01:50:01,470
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Believe me,

1246
01:50:02,340 --> 01:50:04,800
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I shall not be resting for some time.

1247
01:50:05,300 --> 01:50:06,470
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Why?

1248
01:50:07,810 --> 01:50:08,850
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You got your story.

1249
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:12,520
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You know, your plot. It's all there.

1250
01:50:12,810 --> 01:50:16,310
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Maybe it wasn't a plot I was after.

1251
01:50:16,690 --> 01:50:18,440
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}No. What, then?

1252
01:50:18,730 --> 01:50:21,030
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Something else you've given me tonight.

1253
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:22,780
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}And what's that?

1254
01:50:23,780 --> 01:50:25,660
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}The courage to go where

1255
01:50:26,030 --> 01:50:28,200
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}one does not want to go.

1256
01:50:29,790 --> 01:50:31,290
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Mr. Melville,

1257
01:50:31,950 --> 01:50:35,120
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}what you've heard, what I've told you,

1258
01:50:37,630 --> 01:50:41,880
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}will it all be of service to your book?

1259
01:50:43,220 --> 01:50:46,550
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}It will be a work of fiction, Mr. Nickerson,

1260
01:50:47,850 --> 01:50:49,720
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}inspired by truth.

1261
01:50:50,970 --> 01:50:54,230
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}But I don't believe I'll feel the need to use all of it.

1262
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:04,570
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}- Thank you. - Here.

1263
01:51:05,320 --> 01:51:06,070
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Take that with you.

1264
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:08,820
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}No. The money is for you. I insist.

1265
01:51:09,830 --> 01:51:10,790
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I insist you keep it.

1266
01:51:11,540 --> 01:51:15,580
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}And I insist one person in this conversation is sober.

1267
01:51:26,180 --> 01:51:27,090
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}So it's back to, uh...

1268
01:51:27,510 --> 01:51:29,180
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

1269
01:51:29,890 --> 01:51:31,560
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Well, good luck.

1270
01:51:33,270 --> 01:51:34,430
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Thank you.

1271
01:51:37,940 --> 01:51:38,560
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}You know,

1272
01:51:40,020 --> 01:51:43,610
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I heard a man from Pennsylvania drilled a hole in the ground recently

1273
01:51:44,570 --> 01:51:45,950
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}and found oil.

1274
01:51:46,780 --> 01:51:48,070
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}That can't be true.

1275
01:51:48,950 --> 01:51:50,030
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}I heard it, too.

1276
01:51:52,450 --> 01:51:54,580
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Oil from the ground.

1277
01:51:56,580 --> 01:51:57,920
{\fnMicrosoft Sans Serif\fs16\bord2}Fancy that.
