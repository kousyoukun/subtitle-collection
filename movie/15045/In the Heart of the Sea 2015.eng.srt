1
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,846
How does one come
to know the unknowable?

2
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,890
"What faculties must a man possess?

3
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,849
"Since it was discovered that whale oil

4
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,322
"could light our cities
in ways never achieved before,

5
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,602
"it created global demand.

6
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,329
"It has pushed man to venture
further and further

7
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,529
"into the deep blue unknown.

8
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,603
"We know not its depths,

9
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,650
"nor the host of creatures
that live there.

10
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,370
"Monsters.

11
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,681
"Are they real?

12
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,531
"Or do the stories exist only to make us
respect the sea's dark secrets?

13
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,931
"The question both vexes and excites me

14
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,809
"and is the reason
I've written you a second time

15
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,724
"to request a meeting.

16
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,128
"A conversation with you, sir,
I believe will serve me well

17
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,884
"for the novel I intend to write,

18
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,085
"currently entitled Moby Dick.

19
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,005
"I hope you will reconsider my offer.

20
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,327
"The unknown.

21
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,006
"That is where my imagination
yearns to venture.

22
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,360
"And so the question plagues me still.

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,844
"How does a man come to know
the unknowable?

24
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,088
"Sincerely, Herman Melville."

25
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,165
We're closed.

26
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,250
No boarders after 8:00.

27
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,931
You came.

28
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,446
Someone here for you, my love.

29
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,806
Tom Nickerson?

30
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,291
Herman Melville.

31
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,809
We received your letter.

32
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,244
You're either a desperate man

33
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,880
or a fool to come
all the way to Nantucket.

34
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,531
Well, my offer still stands.

35
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,528
Three months' lodgings
for a single night's talk.

36
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,564
All I have in the world.

37
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,961
But I prefer to think of it
as an investment.

38
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,841
I want you to tell me
what happened to the Essex.

39
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,280
What do you think happened?

40
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,650
There are rumblings.
Rumors that the Essex was...

41
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,887
What do you want?

42
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,008
What story do you expect to hear?

43
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,605
That of the whale.

44
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,326
The Essex ran aground.
There was a full inquiry.

45
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,286
I believe the inquiry
was less than truthful.

46
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,167
Get out.

47
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,845
You are the last survivor
of the Essex, sir.

48
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,604
If you won't talk, who will?

49
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,685
Did you not hear me? Leave. Now.

50
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,601
-No. You mustn't go. Please.
-He is in no mind to talk.

51
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,400
And I haven't come all this way
to be humiliated and waste my time.

52
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,482
Please, Mr. Melville.

53
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,889
He won't talk about the Essex to me.

54
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,771
To anyone. Never has. Never.

55
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,602
There's an agony about him.

56
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,804
His soul is in torment,

57
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,201
and in need of confession.

58
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,089
Please, just let me talk to him.

59
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,480
Please.

60
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,247
Love.

61
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,048
I believe it would do you good
to talk to the man.

62
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,281
No.

63
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,769
You listen well.

64
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,008
Who holds this place together
while you drink yourself to death?

65
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,325
You will talk with this man

66
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,882
as much as is necessary to keep the money.

67
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,807
You know our circumstances, Thomas.

68
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,123
Only as much as is necessary.

69
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,250
I'll get whiskey.

70
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,880
I neglected to mention it
in my letter,

71
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,688
but I was a whaler once.

72
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,808
One trip, I mean.

73
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,641
Green hand.

74
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,848
So, you've seen it all.

75
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,804
My wife read your books.

76
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,969
She enjoyed them.

77
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,284
I'm happy to hear it.

78
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,048
I've had good sales.

79
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,210
And I think this story
could surpass the success

80
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,806
of even my first novel,
which did quite well.

81
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,324
Another of your seafaring yarns?

82
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,208
Have you read Hawthorne, Mr. Melville?

83
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,409
Now there's a writer.

84
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,010
Great writer.

85
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,366
He is.

86
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,690
But he is not here. And I am.

87
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,125
For my own particular reasons.

88
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,809
I will tell you of the Essex.

89
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,564
I believe you will be disappointed.

90
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,646
But every word I say will be true.

91
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:21,245
Story of the Essex
is the story of two men.

92
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,891
Captain George Pollard and his first mate,

93
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,925
Owen Chase.

94
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,728
Owen. You don't wanna be late.

95
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,645
I'll be there.

96
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,724
Besides, can't have our daughter
sleeping under a leaky roof, can we?

97
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,082
What makes you so sure it's a girl?

98
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,126
Well, it has to be.

99
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,566
So she can remind me

100
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,600
why I still love you
when you're being stubborn.

101
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,691
Well, if it's to be a daughter,
she'll be a version of you, not me.

102
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,730
Blond locks and determined
to conquer the world.

103
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,325
I suppose after today,

104
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,130
you'll be trading in
that tunic for a uniform.

105
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,406
That's right.

106
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,244
Finally out of this patch of dirt,

107
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,000
into a captain's house like you deserve.

108
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,609
I don't need one of those houses
in town with stuffy neighbors.

109
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,640
There's plenty of room here
for the three of us.

110
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,087
You know, sometimes your kind heart
and good nature

111
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,488
is just unbearable.

112
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,328
Go get your captaincy.

113
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,720
-What's your bid?
-I'll have $1.90.

114
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,043
I've got 1,000 gallons at $2!

115
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,406
I'll take 40 shares!

116
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,048
Seller! Seller! Over here!

117
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,049
Criterion's back with a fine haul.

118
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,765
1,600 barrels.

119
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,967
A new record.

120
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,807
£50 sterling for head matter
on the London market.

121
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,651
Congratulations.

122
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,642
-Good morning, Mr. Chase.
-Mr. Mason.

123
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,251
Come in, please.

124
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,128
My partner, Benjamin Fuller.

125
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,406
Good morning, sir.

126
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,170
Do sit down.

127
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,084
Mr. Chase.

128
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,686
I do hope you realize how satisfied we are

129
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,720
with the work you've done for us
over the years.

130
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,569
Thank you, sir.

131
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,927
Now, one of our ships, the Essex,

132
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,003
has just been refitted at great expense

133
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,202
and is to go to sea.

134
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,928
Now, having made
such an investment in her,

135
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,681
we want to be sure
she's in the best possible hands.

136
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:13,687
So, it gives us great pleasure
to offer you a position aboard her.

137
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,529
As first mate.

138
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,281
As first mate?

139
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,561
Mmm-hmm.

140
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,762
Mr. Mason, you promised me
command of a ship after my last voyage

141
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,207
when I brought you back 1,500 barrels.

142
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,044
Do you remember?
You gave me your word.

143
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,725
That promise must now be deferred.

144
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,804
Like everyone else,
we've had a lean time recently.

145
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,086
No, never on my watch.

146
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,045
Nantucket now dominates the world market.

147
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,808
That must not change.

148
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,611
This is no time for experimentation.

149
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,483
The Essex will be captained
by George Pollard,

150
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,731
scion of a great whaling family.

151
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,569
His father also happens to be our patron.

152
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,000
Blood, Mr. Chase.

153
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,686
You can have all the voyages
under your belt you want,

154
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,490
but blood will always win out.

155
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,650
Yes, well, blood is not gonna fill
a ship with oil, Mr. Mason.

156
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,720
To successfully command,
a captain needs respect.

157
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,320
Now, what if the men don't respect him?

158
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,729
You will make sure that they do.

159
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,048
Ah, good day, gentlemen.

160
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,641
I understand your disappointment,

161
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,007
so, a one-fifteenth lay.

162
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,371
That's more than
I've ever paid any first officer.

163
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,646
And if you bring back
2,000 barrels of oil,

164
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,768
I give you my word,

165
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,325
next time, you will have your captaincy.

166
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,211
You've given me
your word before, Mr. Mason.

167
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,283
No, this time, I'll take it in writing.

168
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,529
Captain Pollard.

169
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,483
We've just had a most
agreeable conversation with Mr. Chase.

170
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,166
He'll be honored to serve under you.

171
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,844
I'm glad to hear it.

172
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,523
Now I'm to babysit a greenhorn.

173
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,451
Some chinless Nantucketer

174
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,921
born with a damn silver spoon
in his mouth.

175
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,208
You know, I should've thrown
the offer back in their faces.

176
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,807
Why? You now have
the offer of command in writing.

177
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,928
Yes, well, a liar's word is worthless,

178
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,765
even on paper.

179
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,971
You know, I'd love you just as much
if you were a merchant captain.

180
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,603
And you wouldn't be gone for two years.

181
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,000
I won't be gone two years.

182
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,842
A Bedford whaler came back
last week who was gone three.

183
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,480
She lost two men
and still with her hull half empty.

184
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,766
Yeah, well, they were from Bedford,

185
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,240
and they didn't have me on board.

186
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,930
Son of a bitch!

187
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,364
I will captain my own ship!

188
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,730
A whaling ship.

189
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,881
Up to them, all we'd ever have
is this patch of dirt,

190
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,440
and that's not gonna happen, Peggy.

191
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,400
Those are your father's words, not yours.

192
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,524
What's wrong with his words?

193
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,324
He wanted things
for his family, for himself.

194
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,841
He was a dreamer, Owen.

195
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,889
Yes, he was.

196
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,804
Dreamed of the sea
and never got to sail it

197
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,325
because of men like them.

198
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,489
At least he got to see his children born.

199
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,010
It's all I know.

200
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,290
I'm sorry.

201
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,365
I married a whaleman.

202
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,926
Hey.

203
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,451
I'll come back as quick
as a summer's night, I swear.

204
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,885
Just come back.

205
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,286
Promise me.

206
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,450
I already swore to you.
Now you want me to promise, too?

207
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,605
I promise.

208
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,849
Son, a word With you.

209
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,171
To be a captain, you cannot be a friend.

210
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,486
You are their superior.

211
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,601
Never forget that.
Never let them forget that.

212
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,966
Thank you, sir.

213
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:57,006
Your great-grandfather and a few others
created this industry.

214
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,566
Without us, without you,
the world plunges into darkness.

215
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,004
I hope to bring honor to
the Pollard family name, sir.

216
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,287
"Thou didst, O Lord,
create the mighty whale

217
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,364
"That wondrous monster of a mighty length

218
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,201
"Beyond conception his unmeasured strength

219
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,609
"But, everlasting God, thou dost ordain

220
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,890
"That we, poor feeble mortals
should engage

221
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,931
"Ourselves, our wives
and children to maintain

222
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,488
"This dreadful monster
with a martial rage"

223
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,566
O Father, grant that your glorious light
shine on these men.

224
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,443
Ensure them a prosperous voyage,

225
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,888
that they may return safely
and with a full ship,

226
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,201
so that the white flames
of Nantucket whale oil

227
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,204
may continue to keep light in our homes,

228
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,081
city streets safe from sin in the night,

229
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,971
and to fuel the machines of industry

230
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,010
that drive our great nation forward

231
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,607
as our noble species evolves.

232
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,570
In your name, we pray.

233
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:29,290
-So, what month was this?
-Late in the year.

234
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,326
We were one of the last ships to go out,

235
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,562
which is why my friend
Barzillai and I got a berth.

236
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,405
You know, I was 14.

237
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,446
Fourteen.

238
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,124
Nickerson, you're standing
around, boy. Move!

239
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,887
First time to sea.
Scared, but more scared to show it.

240
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,770
Barzillai was 17.

241
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,010
Orphans. Grew up on the wharf.

242
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,921
Both in a hurry to be called men.

243
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,731
Grubs, what are those pins
they're wearing?

244
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,770
They're whale pins, Thomas.

245
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,288
How do I get one of them?

246
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,488
Well, you gotta thrust the killing lance

247
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,840
Into the largest beast that
ever breathed on this Earth.

248
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,729
Nickerson, get the green stuff
to Mr. Bond, there.

249
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,442
Make it quick, damn it.

250
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,243
I shall have 12 of those one day.

251
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,040
Windlass is ready
and sails are loose, sir.

252
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,929
Mr. Joy,
this is only half my order!

253
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,680
Put them over the ground tier casks.

254
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,491
Well, well, you being on board
means only one thing.

255
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,643
Yeah, at least there's
one person on this ship

256
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,280
who knows the truth about Owen Chase.

257
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,720
No, that all the other ships
have already crewed up.

258
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,206
Now, now.

259
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,646
I'm a reformed man, Owen.

260
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,686
Question is, are you?

261
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,808
Don't tell me Matthew Joy's
put down the bottle.

262
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,810
Dry as sand.

263
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,650
Has Owen Chase put down his temper?

264
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,889
Ah, serene as the church.

265
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,486
I'll believe that when I see it.

266
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,642
And given our captain,

267
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,162
I'll give your serenity about 48 hours?

268
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,161
Good luck.

269
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,290
Pollard. George Pollard.

270
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,125
Owen Chase.

271
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,960
"Chase."
That's an off-island name, isn't it?

272
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,165
Yes, it is.

273
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,840
And very shortly, we will be
off-island for some time,

274
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,365
and I'll be very much at home.

275
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,728
Must say I was surprised.

276
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,281
Normally, a captain gets
to choose his first mate.

277
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,650
An experienced captain, yes.

278
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,688
'Course, you can understand
from the owners' point of view,

279
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,201
they want to feel their investment's
in the hands of men.

280
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,361
Indeed.

281
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,121
They probably want a little
extra reassurance, that's all.

282
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,211
Well, do keep an eye on me

283
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,725
and let me know
if I'm doing anything wrong.

284
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,525
Oh, I know no other way, Captain.

285
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,007
Hmm.

286
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,124
Mr. Chase, haul short the anchor.

287
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,920
Yank to the wind!
There's topmen aloft.

288
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,564
-Aye!
-Mr. Lawrence, take the helm.

289
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,245
-Aye, sir.
-Mr. Joy, make sail.

290
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,688
Mr. Cole! Mr. Chappel!
Stand by the spanker.

291
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,320
Set your fore staysail
and your fore and main topsails.

292
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,811
Come on, look lively, you lads.

293
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,331
Come on, Nickerson!
While we're young!

294
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,160
Let fall clews
and bunts and sheet ho!

295
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,288
Set topsails and topgallants.

296
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,760
-Heave away on the windlass.
-Heave away on the windlass.

297
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,161
Set topgallants.

298
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,084
Let go clew lines and sheet ho!

299
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,249
There's a snarl in the gasket, sir.

300
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,364
Mr. Chappel, take the helm.

301
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,324
It won't clear, Mr. Chase!

302
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,889
Come on! Why aren't those braces laid out?

303
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,445
Mr. Ray, where are my headsails?

304
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,921
Aye, sir!

305
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,285
Crank away on the windlass!

306
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,120
Crank away on the windlass, sir!

307
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,409
Nickerson, pull!

308
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,480
Make sail, God damn it!

309
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,490
God and all of Nantucket
is watching, men.

310
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,605
Anchor's trim!

311
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,920
Captain! Head down!

312
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,326
Mind your head, Captain.

313
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,080
What's the matter, Mr. Sheppard?

314
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,800
Gasket's fouled the sheet, sir.

315
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,769
It won't clear, Mr. Chase!

316
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,650
Topgallant sheet is jammed!

317
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,320
The gasket still won't clear!

318
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,487
We don't have enough sail on yet.

319
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,641
Still won't clear!

320
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,245
Watch your step!

321
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,405
It's the gasket, Owen!

322
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,121
Stand clear.

323
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,528
Whoa! Bloody hell!

324
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,928
-Let fall your course!
-Heave!

325
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,924
Make fast!

326
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,601
Nice piece of work, Mr. Chase.

327
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,369
If we make Cape Verdes
in the next two weeks,

328
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,603
we'll have a decent chance
of reaching the Pacific on schedule.

329
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,121
Corn, Mr. Chase?

330
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,331
Oh, no, thank you, sir.

331
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,000
Never did have much of a taste for it.

332
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,850
That's odd.

333
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,688
Told your father grew corn on Cape Cod.

334
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,205
That's right. He did.

335
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,401
As you can imagine,

336
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,369
I certainly grew tired
of eating it every day.

337
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,201
Corn.

338
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,481
-Okra. Beans, I believe?
-Mmm-hmm.

339
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,410
Before he went to jail.

340
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,887
Are you familiar with this story, Mr. Joy?

341
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,850
Sir?

342
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,565
Were you aware that

343
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,281
Mr. Chase was effectively orphaned
due to his father's incarceration?

344
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,569
Well, we all have our own paths to sea.

345
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,126
As a rule, we tend
not to ask too many questions.

346
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,846
Hmm.

347
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,405
Can't have been easy, though.

348
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,761
Yet

349
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,926
you had Nantucket's great seafaring family
to adopt you.

350
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,605
This is far from the first time

351
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,047
I've been called a landsman
or an off-islander

352
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,326
by some Nantucketer,

353
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,524
reminding me how I am not
a part of that family.

354
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,000
Now, if the Captain will excuse me,

355
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,282
there are whaleboats
and watches to assign.

356
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,364
No, sir. Not for me.

357
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,763
-Not a drop?
-No, sir.

358
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,283
Like I said,

359
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,364
sometimes the fewer questions one asks,
the better.

360
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,288
Serve that food up.

361
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,803
Getting this
slop on the first day?

362
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,845
Cheap bastards. Where's the meat?

363
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,800
That's a gorgeous girl,
Mr. Chappel.

364
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,810
A vision of beauty, that.
Carved on a varnished whale bone.

365
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,962
-Let me have a touch.
-Don't touch.

366
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,811
I thought you were married, anyway.

367
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,490
I am, and there she is.

368
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,129
Well, that's her nose, anyway.

369
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,487
Congratulations, ladies.

370
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,482
That was a fine job trimming sails today.

371
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,640
A sorrier pack of deck wallopers
I don't think I've ever seen.

372
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,681
Mr. Chappel.

373
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,163
-Sir!
-You're Captain's harpooner.

374
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,684
Mr. Lawrence, you'll be mine.

375
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,161
Aye, sir.

376
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,761
And Mr. Peterson.

377
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,844
Second mate's harpooner.

378
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,207
Aye, sir.

379
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,290
There'll be six men to a boat.

380
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,807
First drills are tomorrow.
Six bells sharp.

381
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,531
We're not even east of Halifax, sir.

382
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,681
What's your name?

383
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,842
Coffin. Henry Coffin.

384
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,880
He's the Captain's cousin, sir.

385
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,689
Well, well, Mr. Coffin.

386
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,769
You think a whale knows
if it's east of Halifax?

387
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,411
I don't know who all of you are
or how you got here.

388
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,011
Some of you probably have felonies to hide
and you're on the run.

389
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,006
That's fine. I don't give a damn.

390
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,721
But in return, you exist for one thing

391
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,326
and one thing only.

392
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,891
And that is whale oil.

393
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,368
I intend to fill our 2,000 barrels

394
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,363
and be home as quickly as possible.

395
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,721
And even when the weather is fine

396
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,530
and there are no whales, Mr. Coffin,

397
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,120
we will lower the boats
and practice all maneuvers

398
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,721
necessary in the capture of a whale.

399
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,087
And any man who is idle
will find himself swimming home.

400
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,241
Is that understood?

401
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,441
Aye, sir.

402
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,601
Sir.

403
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,765
Greenhorn.

404
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,766
On deck.

405
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,443
On you go.

406
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,650
Aye, aye, landsman.

407
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,281
Thomas Nickerson, right?

408
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,527
Aye, sir.

409
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,402
You know, some feel sick at first.

410
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,602
Please, pull me back up!

411
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,729
Best way to square it
with King Neptune, boy!

412
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,120
Please bring me up!

413
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,045
Better now?

414
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,530
Ah, shit.

415
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,605
Sir, I am so sorry.

416
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,970
Well, now you got something
to write home to your mother about.

417
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,805
My mother's buried up in Smith's Hill.

418
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,088
There's a stone for my father, too.

419
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,891
He was lost at sea before I was born.

420
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,326
Here, give me that.

421
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,721
Well, this is your family now, boy.

422
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,882
For better or for worse.

423
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,329
Worse, mostly.

424
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,643
Swab the deck, kid.

425
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,128
Dogwatch! You're gonna learn
what it takes to be Whalers today, mates.

426
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,770
Aye, sir!

427
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,320
You led that line wrong, Nickerson.

428
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,401
Aye, sir.

429
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,170
We'll stay at this
till sundown if we have to.

430
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,600
Aye, Mr. Joy, sir!

431
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,926
Main topsail leech lines!

432
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,570
Harpooner, make ready to boat!

433
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,480
-Aye, sir!
-Aye, Mr. Joy!

434
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,045
Go main topsail leech lines.

435
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,810
Too slow, you damn coofs!

436
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,001
The bailing piggins.

437
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,044
You will learn
every inch of this ship

438
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,320
-before you return to your bunks.
-Aye, sir!

439
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,409
Sweat that line, Barz.

440
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,561
You need to move quicker, Mr. Ray.

441
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,840
Aye, Mr. Chase.

442
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,480
Ain't no greenhorns
no more, Mr. Chase.

443
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,044
You're a sailor now!

444
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,722
Not bad, Mr. Ray. Well done.

445
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,609
-Forecourse bunts!
-Aye, sir.

446
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,047
Get used to it, lads.
You're gonna work like horses.

447
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,201
Mr. Chase?

448
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,961
Sir.

449
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,961
Set stunsails.

450
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,960
Is that wise, sir?
We're nearing the Gulf Stream.

451
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,080
Best keep it five knots
till we can see the weather.

452
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,049
We are two days behind.

453
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,091
We need to make up the time
if we're to catch the easterlies.

454
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,168
Set stunsails.

455
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,730
-Set stunsails.
-Aye, Mr. Chase!

456
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,322
-Come on, move.
-Belay that! Set stunsails!

457
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,164
Get aloft, Mr. Coffin.

458
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,800
-The captain wants speed.
-Aye, sir.

459
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,725
Look for braces, lads.

460
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,040
-Trim for speed.
-Aye, sir.

461
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,921
Set fore the main topsail
and topgallant stunsails, men. Move it.

462
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,402
Make fast your stunsail halyard.

463
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,244
Make fast stunsail halyard, sir.

464
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,530
Stunsail boom ready, sir!

465
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,008
Bracing fore topsail, sir.

466
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,805
Hey!

467
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,803
The captain's got us moving now!

468
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,640
We're finally getting somewhere!

469
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,890
She may be old,
but she can still roll, boys!

470
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,720
Sir, a squall on the starboard bow.

471
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,962
We must shorten sail immediately.

472
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,963
Not just yet, Mr. Chase.

473
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,487
Sir, we are headed into a squall
at more than 8 knots,

474
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,971
and it's moving faster than that.

475
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,401
Let it come.
The men are soft from months on land.

476
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,561
They need a good baptism.

477
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,051
Let them know our work has begun.

478
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,484
If we don't shorten sail and bear off,
it'll catch us on the beam.

479
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,769
Mr. Chase, we will stand on.

480
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,411
Mr. Lawrence?

481
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,561
Hold our course.

482
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,126
Holding course, sir.

483
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,443
We'll lose half a day running
like that. We'll skirt the edge of it.

484
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,644
If the men can't handle a gust like this,
then God help us all.

485
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,204
Best secure for heavy weather.

486
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,960
Rough weather coming up, boys.

487
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,047
Get this deck secure.

488
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,128
Double gripes on the boats!

489
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,124
Best prepare for weather, Mr. Bond.

490
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,009
We're headed into a squall.

491
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,650
Secure the main hatch!

492
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,840
She's moving fast!

493
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,528
We must fall off and run with it.

494
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,564
We will stand on, Mr. Chase.

495
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,080
Mr. Lawrence!

496
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,164
-Hold your course.
-Holding course, sir.

497
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,001
Sea's coming aboard!

498
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,850
Hold on!

499
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,970
Shorten sail, Mr. Chase!

500
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,960
-Climb to weather and grab the shrouds!
-Climb to weather!

501
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,083
Get to windward and hold on!

502
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,446
-We need to get those sails down!
-Go lee!

503
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,922
Nickerson, hold fast!

504
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,725
Hold steady lines!

505
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,360
Hold fast!

506
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,807
Turn the ship!

507
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,361
Turn to leeward!

508
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,444
No! The damage is done!

509
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,201
-Strike topgallants. Let fly sheets!
-No, turn the ship!

510
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,885
Veer off, Mr. Lawrence.

511
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,202
It's too late! It's too goddamn late!

512
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,522
-We'll be broadsided!
-Turn this ship!

513
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,726
-Hold on!
-Turn!

514
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,560
Strike those damn topgallants!

515
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,441
Hold on!

516
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,882
Look out!

517
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,525
Mr. Joy!

518
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,920
-We have to cut away the topgallants!
-Topgallants away!

519
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,680
We have to get her upright!

520
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,450
You wish to see me, sir?

521
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,730
At six bells tomorrow,

522
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,882
you will assemble the crew.

523
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,840
Inform them that we will be returning
to Nantucket for repairs.

524
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,684
You will then apologize to them

525
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,206
for interfering with a captain's order,

526
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,761
which nearly cost the lives
of every man on this ship today.

527
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,121
What?

528
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,966
I'll accept your resignation
upon our return to port.

529
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,407
That will be all.

530
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,885
-It was your order to set stunsails, sir.
-That decision was sound.

531
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,769
The men needed testing.

532
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,410
So you send them into a storm?

533
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,165
That was unlucky.

534
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,368
No, it was bad seamanship.

535
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,767
And blaming misfortune
is just plain weakness.

536
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,285
Damn your impertinence!

537
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,888
Do you know who you're speaking to?

538
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,646
My name is Captain George Pollard.

539
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,801
Pollard!

540
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,647
And you, Mr. Chase,
no matter how many whale pins

541
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,325
you may have on your lapel,

542
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,244
are nothing more than the son of a farmer

543
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,689
who's managed to bully his way
into an officer's tunic.

544
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,771
Now get out.

545
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,646
To return to port
without a single barrel of oil

546
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,365
would be a mistake, sir.

547
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,561
And not behoove a man
whose name is Pollard.

548
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,849
Or Chase, for that matter.

549
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,800
And the best thing for both of us

550
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,571
would be to work all hours God sends us,

551
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,485
fill this ship with oil
and be home inside a year

552
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,688
and rid of one another
as quickly as possible.

553
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,851
Trust me, I am every bit
as desirous of that as you.

554
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,609
Of course, that is a captain's decision.

555
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,362
They were like an ill-married couple.

556
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,204
An ill-married couple
will tolerate each other, Mr. Melville.

557
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,204
But an ill-married couple
can also bring down a ship.

558
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,000
Are you married, Mr. Melville?

559
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,202
-I am.
-God have mercy on you.

560
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,960
First child on the way, too.

561
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,085
So, does your good wife
know that you've brought

562
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,447
all you have in the world here tonight

563
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,681
and given it to a stranger?

564
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,441
No, sir.

565
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,722
You're full of surprises, aren't you?

566
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,721
So,

567
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,328
the Essex did not return to port.

568
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,647
She did not.

569
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,404
-She continued out to sea.
-Yes, she did.

570
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,971
And before long,

571
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,326
we heard that call

572
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,449
that all whalemen pray for.

573
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,720
"Blows."

574
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,329
Blows!

575
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,966
To windward!

576
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,890
There she blows!

577
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,846
Right or sperm, Mr. Ramsdell?

578
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,331
Sperm whales they are!

579
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,010
There go the flukes!

580
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,526
Mr. Chase!

581
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,920
Hoist and swing boats.

582
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,089
All hands! All hands on deck!

583
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,285
All hands on deck!

584
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,611
Away the boats.

585
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,763
Lower away!

586
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,361
Straight! Crack them backbones.

587
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,965
Aye, sir!

588
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,326
Give way all.

589
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,290
Spring those oars till your arms fall off.

590
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,686
There they breach!

591
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,007
Thataway, boys! Full pressure!

592
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,241
Aye, sir!

593
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,325
Come on! Put your back into it.

594
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,327
Pull!

595
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,686
Pull like a vengeance!

596
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,370
There she blows!

597
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,004
-That's a calf.
-Whoo-hoo!

598
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,201
That's the calf?

599
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,647
That's the cow.

600
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,525
And that's our boy!
That's the money.

601
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,764
-Nickerson, push!
-Sorry, sir.

602
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,321
Forty-barreler?

603
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,841
Fifty.

604
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,362
Oh, he's a buster!

605
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,930
Bite the oars, lads.

606
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,164
Blister your goddamn lungs!

607
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,806
Full pressure!

608
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,481
Smartly, lads! Smartly!

609
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,961
Mind your oars!

610
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,886
-Mr. Ramsdell, prepare the line.
-Aye, sir.

611
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,240
Mr. Lawrence, the first one's mine.

612
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,845
Take me to the pretty spot.

613
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,889
-Pull!
-Come on. Stay on him.

614
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,006
You're on your first
Nantucket sleigh ride, boy.

615
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,651
Oh, my God!

616
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,281
Whoo!

617
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,605
Look at him!

618
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,888
The most fearsome creature
ever to live on this Earth.

619
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,246
He sounds.

620
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,681
My hands!

621
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,608
LAWRENCE. We need
to wet the line, Nickerson.

622
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,568
Give way, lads. Give way.

623
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,649
Got 140 fathoms
of line left, Mr. Chase.

624
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,323
Eighty fathoms of line left, sir!

625
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,846
He's gonna pull us under!

626
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,721
Matthew, I need your line!

627
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,366
Keep going!

628
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,841
-Peterson, give me the line.
-Aye, sir.

629
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,809
Give me that line, Mr. Peterson.

630
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,322
We're down
to 60 fathoms of line left, sir!

631
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,648
-Twenty fathoms, Mr. Chase.
-Tie it off!

632
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,568
-Safe!
-Go!

633
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,848
-Peterson, lay out.
-Aye, sir.

634
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,768
How many fathoms can he go?

635
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,523
70 fathoms left, sir.

636
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,081
No, no, no, wait.

637
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,201
-Owen!
-No, no! Not yet!

638
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,885
Don't touch that line!

639
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,248
Down to 50 fathoms, sir.

640
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,361
Owen, God damn it!

641
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,211
I said don't touch it!

642
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,727
30 fathoms left, Mr. Joy.

643
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,845
Ten fathoms left, sir!

644
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,610
Backwater!

645
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,326
Push!

646
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,729
Chimney's afire!

647
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,326
Chimney's afire!

648
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,401
Afire!

649
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,800
Hurry it along, lads.

650
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,803
God! Get out, you bastards.

651
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,565
Blubber in the Oil.

652
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,008
Smell that, boys!
That's us making money!

653
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,811
Get out of there,
you sons of bitches.

654
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,800
-There, you got it?
-There's not a chance.

655
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,800
-How's it looking?
-It's not good.

656
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,365
That's it.

657
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,207
-Mr. Chase, sir.
-Yeah?

658
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,120
That's all of it, sir.
We can't get any more out.

659
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,688
That's the gold in there, boys.
Come on, keep digging.

660
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,645
We're too big to wriggle down there.

661
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,360
Then find someone who can.

662
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,242
Nickerson! Come here, boy.

663
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,366
Hey! I said come here.

664
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,246
Climb on into him.

665
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,160
Come on, Thomas.

666
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,320
What's in there is worth
a hell of a lot more

667
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,244
than what they're boiling down.

668
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,561
Sir!

669
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,806
I can't, I'm...

670
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,721
I'm sorry. I can't.

671
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,846
You get down there,
or I'll have you sleep down there.

672
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,001
You best put that between your teeth, boy.

673
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,762
Stinks worse than
the devil's asshole down there.

674
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,166
Thanks.

675
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,287
Sorry.

676
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,807
Here, Nickerson,
take my pillow with you.

677
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,801
Down you go.

678
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,322
A man gets to know himself down there.

679
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,726
-They ever send you into a whale's head?
-No.

680
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,041
I was spared.

681
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,327
Well, that's where the treasure is.

682
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,807
I'll never forget that first bull.

683
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,446
Forty-seven barrels.

684
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,211
'Course, the happiness was short-lived.

685
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,641
The waters there had all been fished out?

686
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,131
That they had.

687
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,646
So, we headed further out.

688
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,526
Yeah.

689
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:29,160
Took us a month to round the Horn.

690
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:34,003
Left the South Atlantic behind
with a sliver of hope

691
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,606
that things could change for the better.

692
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:41,408
But making the Pacific
didn't improve our lot.

693
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:46,127
Whale sightings were too damn scarce.

694
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,002
After nearly a year at sea,

695
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:55,131
the temperaments of our captain
and first mate grew more strained.

696
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,606
Captain Pollard spent most
days and nights in his cabin,

697
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,844
afraid to look his crew in the eye.

698
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,766
Our hold was almost empty.

699
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,530
And to gaze upon our paltry efforts

700
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,842
only served as a reminder

701
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,044
that we were a long way from going home.

702
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,726
No, no. I don't talk that talk.

703
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,564
-Speak English.
-Offer me more.

704
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,044
-Here, sir.
-This, Nantucket whale oil.

705
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,569
-Ain't no skinny hog worth more than that.
-More!

706
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,128
Capitán. Excuse me.

707
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,567
The locals told me your voyage
was waylaid, sir.

708
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,124
Captain George Pollard. The Essex.

709
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,481
Capitán Clemente Pelaez, the Santa Maria.

710
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,882
Would you buy a colleague a drink?

711
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,686
No, no.

712
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,964
Bad luck? How far out?

713
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,641
Far enough for only a fool to go.

714
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,525
How far would that be?

715
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,001
A thousand leagues along the equator.

716
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,167
The Offshore Grounds.

717
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,090
Were there whales there?

718
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,241
More than you've ever dreamed.

719
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,686
Hundreds.

720
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,209
Fields of flukes far as the eye can see.

721
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:40,364
Could have filled up 3,000 barrels
in the space of a day.

722
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:41,800
What do you mean, "could have"?

723
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:48,567
If it weren't for that demon.

724
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,926
A whale.

725
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,684
White as alabaster.

726
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,362
Hundred feet long.

727
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,842
Sent six of my crew to their graves.

728
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:12,643
And the rest of us,
something to remember him by.

729
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,240
Now, this white whale,

730
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,641
did he dance a jig
and pick your pocket as well?

731
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,241
Hmm?

732
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,247
Gracias.

733
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:29,884
You believe that?

734
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,928
If we set sail now,
catch the south easterlies

735
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:37,600
at their best time and fill our belly,

736
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,205
we could be home in six months.

737
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,084
What say you, Mr. Chase?

738
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,605
No need to endure our predicament

739
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,444
for a moment longer than necessary.

740
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:47,931
Amen to that.

741
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,241
Amen.

742
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,568
Greed took hold
of our captain and first mate.

743
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,970
So we headed out.

744
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,687
A thousand leagues along the equator.

745
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:04,401
Where knowledge ended, speculation began.

746
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,849
That's where the whales had gone to hide.

747
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,810
As far from man as they could possibly go.

748
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,924
But we hunted them down.

749
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,885
Centuries before,

750
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:19,203
sailors feared
sailing off the edge of the Earth.

751
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,043
But we were headed for the edge of sanity.

752
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,489
Trust gave way to doubt.

753
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,450
Hope to blind superstition.

754
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,803
Captain, the men are talking.

755
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,041
That's what men do.

756
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,687
They aren't happy with your decision
to sail out this far.

757
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,083
Well, did you correct them?

758
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,130
Did you remind them of our purpose
to fill this ship with whale oil,

759
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,090
and if the whales are 1,000 leagues out,
that that is where we will go?

760
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,368
Cousin, please.

761
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,765
This is madness.

762
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,645
You have let yourself
be influenced by that man.

763
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,849
You must turn this ship back.

764
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,131
I suggest you go back down,

765
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:09,648
reassure the men, be a leader

766
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:14,411
and don't ever, ever abuse
the privilege of family with me again.

767
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,130
Mr. Coffin.

768
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,041
What is it?

769
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:50,761
Listen.

770
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,201
Mr. Chase?
I see some white water.

771
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,840
-Where?
-Portside!

772
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,291
-We're away!
-Portside, Captain!

773
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,640
-Where are they?
-You see anything?

774
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:06,927
Lower away!

775
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:11,331
Lower away! Lower away!

776
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:14,040
The devil take the Mexican grounds!

777
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,964
Peak oars!

778
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:57,600
Give it to him, Mr. Chappel!

779
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,404
Stick him, man! Stick him!

780
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,923
Dead ahead, Peterson!

781
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:22,131
Don't let him chew your oars, boys.
Back to it.

782
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,206
-The whale?
-Yes.

783
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,361
-So it's true?
-Yes.

784
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,644
Too much is true.

785
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:55,971
Get it up!

786
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,210
Full pressure!

787
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,161
Mr. Bond!

788
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,403
Back the foreyard, lower the tackle!

789
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,846
Aye, sir!

790
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:36,011
Here she comes, Peterson. Now, now!

791
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:52,280
Mr. Lawrence, take us leeward,
head us straight for the school.

792
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:53,481
Aye, sir.

793
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,842
-Hot tar, sir.
-We'll find him.

794
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,405
We're boat to black skin.

795
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,481
Beach us on her!

796
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:16,090
She's ours, men!

797
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,764
What was that, Mr. Lawrence?

798
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:55,451
Mr. Chase!

799
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:04,641
God damn it.

800
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:06,806
Find Mr...

801
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,171
Mr. Easton!

802
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:52,406
Get Mr. Lawrence
to man the pumps!

803
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:54,241
Where is he?

804
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,166
Port bow!

805
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:10,167
Get me the biggest irons we have.

806
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:14,846
He wants a fight?

807
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:26,401
Never seen a whale do that.

808
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:27,886
Mr. Lawrence,
take the wheel.

809
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:30,202
Mr. Ramsdell,
secure the other end of the line

810
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:31,930
-to the foremast.
-Aye, sir.

811
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,403
As I live and breathe, he's mine.

812
00:57:58,680 --> 00:57:59,681
Ah!

813
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,402
-Cut the line!
-Look out!

814
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:17,926
-Captain!
-What?

815
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,641
The Essex! She's listing.

816
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,769
Turn this boat around!

817
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:10,961
-Help me!
-Nickerson!

818
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:12,485
-Mr. Joy!
-Here!

819
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:13,721
-Give me your hand!
-Help!

820
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,046
Nickerson!

821
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:52,566
Mr. Chase!

822
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,285
A whale, sir.

823
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,010
It stove the ship.

824
01:00:58,680 --> 01:00:59,761
What?

825
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:02,486
We lost Easton and Sanborn.

826
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:06,765
The pumps are useless, sir.

827
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:15,730
Prepare to abandon ship.

828
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,371
We can't row our way home.

829
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,645
We'll have to strip her of her sails

830
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,325
-and jimmy-rig something.
-Aye, sir.

831
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:23,881
Gather as much food
and water as you can carry.

832
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:26,327
We're gonna need
all the fresh water you can find.

833
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,400
Nickerson,
you grab as much as you can.

834
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:29,441
Barz, come with me.

835
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,771
Sweet Lord!

836
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:37,928
First, the sails,
then the provisions.

837
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:43,090
Get as much food
as you can carry, lad.

838
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,965
Make haste, boys!

839
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:48,964
Nickerson, there are
more casks in steerage.

840
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,282
-Got it?
-Hardtack is dry.

841
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:52,971
Move sprightly, gentlemen.

842
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,281
Lower away!

843
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,762
-Take those tack lines.
-Up aloft!

844
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:57,960
Lower away! Bring it down!

845
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:59,240
Mr. Cole, get that yard down.

846
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:00,880
Bring it down. Keep it coming!

847
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,325
Hold off!

848
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:13,080
-Come on, Nickerson!
-Get those sails!

849
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:15,841
There you go.

850
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,406
Get that yard down!

851
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:25,081
We need the sails. Not enough water.

852
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,006
Get the barrels, now!

853
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,161
Strip that rigging!

854
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:36,720
More fresh water!
More hardtack! Come on!

855
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,720
I can see
more casks in the steerage!

856
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:41,640
Benjamin! Quick! Come on!

857
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:42,886
-Give me your hand!
-Get him up.

858
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,166
I got you.

859
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:45,726
Hardtack!

860
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,684
Come on! Move it!

861
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:49,926
Step lively, Mr. Nickerson!

862
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:57,681
Gotta get away from the oil!

863
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,480
She's going down! She's listing!

864
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:00,521
Where's Owen?

865
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:01,847
Nickerson, where is Mr. Chase?

866
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,650
He was just here, sir.

867
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:06,047
-Come on, hurry up!
-Owen!

868
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,000
-Mr. Chase!
-We gotta shove off!

869
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:09,607
Come on, now, boys!

870
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,166
Oil on deck!

871
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:14,364
-Captain!
-Mr. Chase!

872
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:35,971
Mr. Chase, sir!

873
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:37,805
Owen!

874
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:39,406
Where is the first mate?

875
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:42,291
-Owen!
-Mr. Chase, sir!

876
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:51,645
-Owen!
-She's gonna blow!

877
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,120
-Owen!
-We gotta move!

878
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:55,083
No, wait! Wait!

879
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:56,686
Mr. Chase, sir!

880
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,046
Mr. Chase!

881
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:46,762
There he is!
There he is! There he is!

882
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:50,890
-Over here!
-Mr. Chase!

883
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:54,811
Move that!

884
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,164
Mr. Chase, sir.

885
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,130
-Here!
-Get ahold, now.

886
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:00,606
We got you.

887
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,800
-Sir.
-You're all right now, Mr. Chase.

888
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:09,086
Going fishing, are we?

889
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,482
Clean and load it, Mr. Joy.

890
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:26,045
Back away,
or she'll take us down with her.

891
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:11,121
Captain.

892
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:13,281
What about our provisions?

893
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,207
Two ounces of hardtack a day per man.

894
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,124
And half a cup of water.

895
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,644
Hey, man, we can't live on that.

896
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,320
Not for more than a few days.

897
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:50,361
It's he.

898
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,130
Yeah, it's him, all right.

899
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:02,489
You don't fool me, Mr. Chase.

900
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:04,366
Mr. Coffin?

901
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,848
-That right?
-You put us here.

902
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:09,128
You know you put us here.

903
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:12,680
-Hey! Put it down!
-Mr. Coffin, put the pistol down.

904
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,166
-Say you're scared!
-What are you doing?

905
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:16,000
Mr. Coffin, put the pistol down.

906
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:18,200
You know what happens
when the food and water runs out?

907
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:20,209
Do as the captain says, Coffin!

908
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:21,726
I just wanna see the landsman scared.

909
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:23,800
Mr. Coffin, put the pistol down.
That's an order!

910
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:26,081
-Do as the captain says! Now!
-Say it!

911
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:27,280
-Henry.
-Say it!

912
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:29,367
Say it!

913
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:30,847
Henry!

914
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:33,050
Put the pistol down.

915
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:38,526
Henry!

916
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:40,526
Put it down.

917
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:18,611
So east it was.

918
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:21,961
Back in the direction we'd come.

919
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:25,764
Though only the sun
and compass told us so.

920
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:29,127
All directions looked the same.

921
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,570
Our hope was to catch
the Westerlies to Easter Island.

922
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:35,964
A journey of 3,000 miles.

923
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,330
In 12 days, we have drifted south.

924
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:41,883
Six degrees latitude.

925
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:45,371
We're not one mile closer
to Easter Island.

926
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:47,800
We stayed in the same place.

927
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:52,449
We are cursed.

928
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:55,121
We'll make up for it
when we catch the variables.

929
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,765
We'll catch them.

930
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:31,763
Chappel!

931
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:33,160
Chappel!

932
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,165
Chappel!

933
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:36,321
You've got him, Captain!

934
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:44,042
Mr. Joy, the halyard's jammed!

935
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:51,241
Mr. Joy!
You all right, Mr. Joy?

936
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,166
Grab the tiller!

937
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:58,605
-Grab it!
-Matthew!

938
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:02,125
Get that sail down!

939
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:34,802
Matthew. Hey, what happened?

940
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:36,726
What happened?

941
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:38,689
Owen. What are you doing here?

942
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,081
-Let me take a look.
-No, no, no.

943
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:41,920
-Lay still. Let me look.
-Owen, I'm fine.

944
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:43,405
All right. Just relax. Relax.
Let me take a look.

945
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:44,680
-I'm fine!
-I know. I know.

946
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:46,210
I just wanna take a look.

947
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:53,244
I banged my head.
Just a scratch, all right?

948
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:54,766
-Just a scratch.
-Give him some water.

949
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:58,050
-I don't need any water!
-Give him some goddamn water!

950
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:00,123
No, no, no. I don't need water. I'm fine.

951
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:09,010
-Yeah.
-Take that. Take it.

952
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:12,410
Hey. I got you, I got you.

953
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:16,005
You're all right. You're all right.

954
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:23,007
Hey! What're you all looking at?
I'm fine.

955
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:25,003
Captain Pollard. Fit as a fiddle.

956
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:28,088
Fit as a goddamned fiddle. You hear me?

957
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:30,161
-Owen.
-Yeah.

958
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:31,566
I'm fine.

959
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:33,245
All right? I'm fine!

960
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:37,601
-You're a tough son of a bitch.
-Thank you. I'm fine. Get out of here.

961
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:40,091
He's good.

962
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:42,321
Let's go.

963
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,240
Why waste water on a dead man?

964
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:51,771
Them two men have known each other,
sailed together since childhood.

965
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,001
Now, tell me,

966
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:56,243
could you sit there and watch
your own brother die?

967
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:59,280
Simply a matter of numbers, Mr. Chappel.

968
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,722
There's not enough for all of us.

969
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,371
Why waste water on a dead man?

970
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:19,520
Why waste water on...

971
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:23,006
Why waste water? Why waste?

972
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:25,808
Why waste water on a dead man?

973
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:27,521
Mr. Nickerson?

974
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:30,889
-Why waste water...
-You all right, sir?

975
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:34,327
-I cannot.
-Cannot what?

976
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:36,165
No, you...

977
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:38,322
You have enough. More than enough.

978
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,125
But, sir, we've come so far.

979
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:41,646
We have come to an end.

980
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:43,086
We have an agreement, sir.

981
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:44,885
Take the money and leave!

982
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:46,326
The devil's bargain.

983
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,166
No, sir.

984
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:50,488
The devil loves unspoken secrets.

985
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:56,361
Especially those that
fester in a man's soul.

986
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:00,205
What's yours?

987
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:20,725
I am not a great writer.

988
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:25,525
I am not Hawthorne.

989
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,441
But from my first hearing of it,

990
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,043
this tale has haunted me.

991
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:35,405
It consumes me.

992
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:38,609
I fear if I do not write it,

993
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:42,125
then I should never write again.

994
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:44,726
What else?

995
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:48,730
I fear if I do write it,

996
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:53,291
that it will not be
as good as it should be.

997
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,563
Continue the story, sir.

998
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:08,489
For the both of us.

999
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,843
Pass that down.

1000
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:32,771
Thank you, sir.

1001
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:40,805
We thank you, Lord, for this is our food.

1002
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,246
I'm sorry.

1003
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:44,608
For life and health,

1004
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:46,566
and every good.

1005
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:48,524
-Let all manner to...
-Land.

1006
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:50,201
Land!

1007
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:53,803
-Land! Land!
-Land!

1008
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:56,805
-Land!
-Land!

1009
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:00,090
Oars! Give way! Give way!

1010
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:04,284
Oars! Now! Give way! Row!

1011
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:14,200
-I saw it, Mr. Chase.
-That you did, boy.

1012
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:27,010
Hold fast.
Hold fast! Hold fast!

1013
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:31,000
-Mr. Chase, sir. What is it?
-Mr. Chase!

1014
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:33,847
What the devil is it?
Why have you stopped?

1015
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,491
He's been following us!

1016
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:37,609
What is he talking about?

1017
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:39,800
There's nothing out there,
Mr. Chase!

1018
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:42,560
-There ain't nothing out there, sir!
-Sir, what are you doing?

1019
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:58,081
Brace! Brace! Brace!

1020
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:01,161
No!

1021
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,201
Where is he?

1022
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,404
This could be Ducie Island.

1023
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,765
Without a map, compass or quadrant,
there's no way to be certain.

1024
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:36,647
We will keep fires going night and day.

1025
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:40,569
Hope a passing ship
catches sight of our smoke.

1026
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:39,050
This is what I wanted you to see.

1027
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:49,882
They've been here a long time, no doubt.

1028
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,769
Waiting for a ship.

1029
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:55,449
But no ship came.

1030
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:59,329
No ship is going to come.

1031
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:01,770
If we stay, we die.

1032
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:05,086
How long do you think
it'll take the tropic birds

1033
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:07,841
to stop coming here once
they see their eggs eaten?

1034
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:29,729
It's a privilege to know
the moment of one's death in advance,

1035
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:32,290
be able to prepare for it.

1036
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:36,326
Curse to be so far from home

1037
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:39,644
without a chance to say goodbyes,

1038
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:42,041
without a chance to make peace,

1039
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,848
without a chance to settle the scores.

1040
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,846
Then let us at least settle
those between us, Captain.

1041
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:56,045
Captain of what?

1042
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:59,331
The Essex was lost
through no fault of yours.

1043
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:00,686
I was as much to blame for...

1044
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,644
You are not the captain.

1045
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:09,688
But you were born to do this job.

1046
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,689
I was just born into it.

1047
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,881
What do we do, do you think, George?

1048
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:32,687
And what offense did we give God
to upset him so?

1049
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:35,000
The only creature to have
offended God here

1050
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:36,081
is the whale.

1051
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:38,366
Not us?

1052
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:43,522
In our arrogance, our greed,
look where we find ourselves.

1053
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:46,844
We are supreme creatures
made in God's own likeness.

1054
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:50,571
Earthly kings whose business it is

1055
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,927
to circumnavigate
the planet bestowed to us.

1056
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:55,769
To bend nature to our will.

1057
01:22:56,320 --> 01:23:00,325
You really feel like an earthly king
after everything that we've been through?

1058
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:03,089
We're nothing. We're...

1059
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:05,561
We're specks. And dust.

1060
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:08,928
We sail into the sun at dawn.

1061
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:16,402
If we are to die,
then with God's grace, let us die as men.

1062
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:29,605
Are we ready, Mr. Weeks?

1063
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:30,807
Aye, sir.

1064
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:39,890
Mr. Chappel?

1065
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:41,281
Mr. Wright?

1066
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:43,130
I can't do it, sir.

1067
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:45,730
Me, Wrights and Weeks,

1068
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:48,160
we're staying.

1069
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,450
You ready to go, Matthew?

1070
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:10,920
I'll give you a hand.
Here, you gotta get up.

1071
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:12,491
No, there's no point. You hear me?

1072
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:14,483
No, we're going home.
We're going home.

1073
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:15,971
There's no point.

1074
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:18,490
Just go.

1075
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:23,964
God damn it, Matthew.

1076
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:28,166
It's all right.

1077
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:31,841
Well, I'll send a boat for you
the minute we get back.

1078
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:34,361
Then we'll play cards
back in Nantucket, all right?

1079
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:35,766
Yeah.

1080
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:37,644
-It's a deal.
-Good.

1081
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:46,811
You want me to open that for you?

1082
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,041
Ah...

1083
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:52,171
I think I'll manage.

1084
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:54,531
If it comes to that.

1085
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:00,249
God be with you, brother.

1086
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:03,450
Yeah, and you.

1087
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:24,045
Brother Peterson?

1088
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:27,210
Y'all coming with us?

1089
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:28,921
Mr. Peterson.

1090
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:31,367
Why don't you come in our boat
with Mr. Bond here?

1091
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:06,489
Where... Where is he?

1092
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:09,565
Pollard?

1093
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:13,207
Mr. Lawrence. Mr. Lawrence, wake up.

1094
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,130
Where's the other boat gone?

1095
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:18,804
-Pollard!
-Captain Pollard!

1096
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:21,811
-Captain Pollard!
-Captain Pollard, sir!

1097
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:23,805
-Pollard.
-Captain!

1098
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:26,324
Captain Pollard!

1099
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:30,486
Pollard!

1100
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:36,361
What's the matter?

1101
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:53,965
Benjamin. What are you doing?

1102
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:56,000
He's dead.

1103
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:58,011
Putting him overboard, sir.

1104
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:01,926
Look at me.

1105
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:03,127
Look at me, Benjamin.

1106
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:12,286
No right-minded sailor discards
what might yet save him.

1107
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:25,482
Listen to me, boy. Listen to me.

1108
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:31,330
He can help us.

1109
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,764
My God. My heavenly king.

1110
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:37,687
Sweetness is the power of his grace.

1111
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:39,001
With longing eyes,

1112
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:42,410
thy creatures await on thee
for daily food.

1113
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:45,928
My soul is dead.

1114
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:01,883
So it was decided.

1115
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:10,724
We prepared the body.

1116
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:15,768
We removed the organs.

1117
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:21,251
Separated his limbs from his body

1118
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:25,491
and cut all the flesh from the bones.

1119
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:31,246
After which,

1120
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:34,164
we closed the body

1121
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:36,721
and we sewed it up

1122
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:39,722
as decently as we could

1123
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:42,561
and committed it to the sea.

1124
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:46,449
We ate the heart first.

1125
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:56,491
You judge me.

1126
01:28:58,760 --> 01:28:59,807
No.

1127
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:07,446
There.

1128
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:09,481
There.

1129
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:11,771
It is done.

1130
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:15,771
It is out.

1131
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:19,204
And you've never told anyone?

1132
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:22,807
No.

1133
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:25,806
Not even your wife?

1134
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:29,521
Do you think she could ever love me

1135
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:32,809
if she knew the abominations
I had committed?

1136
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:34,883
Yes. She would.

1137
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:39,802
And if you had told me
the story when we met,

1138
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:43,330
I would still wear your ring today.

1139
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,048
The strength of that boy

1140
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:49,323
still lives in you.

1141
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:52,400
I see that.

1142
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:55,244
Even if you don't.

1143
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:19,529
You can finish your story now, my love.

1144
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:36,646
Hey, sit up.

1145
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:41,440
Listen,

1146
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:44,085
put your head back.

1147
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:48,925
Look, we still got
a few drops of water left.

1148
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:52,411
Don't you quit on me.
We're going home.

1149
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:01,925
Do you have a family back home, Mr. Chase?

1150
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:03,809
Yeah, I have a wife.

1151
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:09,441
Yes, and a son or a daughter.

1152
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:55,927
Very well.

1153
01:31:58,120 --> 01:32:00,168
-Captain.
-We will draw again.

1154
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:02,045
We will do no such thing.

1155
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:04,241
We'll draw again.

1156
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:06,525
Mr. Ramsdell,

1157
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:08,964
you will assume command of this vessel.

1158
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:13,086
Cousin, will you?

1159
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:15,927
You're our...

1160
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:18,367
You're our captain.
The men need you.

1161
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:21,645
The men will be fine.

1162
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:24,046
Please.

1163
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:26,165
Please. Please.

1164
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:28,370
-Henry.
-Let us draw again.

1165
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:30,850
It is an order.

1166
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:34,171
If you cannot do it,

1167
01:32:34,360 --> 01:32:36,169
pass the pistol to another man.

1168
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:05,725
Henry, no, no, no!

1169
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:18,010
You gotta help me, kid.
You gotta help me.

1170
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:23,569
We were weeks in the doldrums.

1171
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:26,402
That part of the Pacific
is more desert than ocean.

1172
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:29,569
The sun beating down.

1173
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:31,606
My fear.

1174
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:35,005
All I could think about

1175
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:38,285
was that everyone would die,

1176
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:40,169
and I'd be the last left alive.

1177
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:45,526
And as best Mr. Chase could tell,
we were still 800 miles from land.

1178
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:53,210
Mr. Chase.

1179
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:01,041
Ah.

1180
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:02,845
Captain Pollard.

1181
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:06,891
I am happy to see you.

1182
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:10,320
Been very little happiness
in our survival.

1183
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:14,004
Or in ours, sir.

1184
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:16,765
Barzillai?

1185
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:21,130
The third boat?

1186
01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:23,241
They've, uh...

1187
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:26,450
They've been gone for days.

1188
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:28,964
I'm afraid they're lost, sir.

1189
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:00,762
Mr. Chase,
you have the best position.

1190
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:19,131
It's just a whale.

1191
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:24,480
He's there! Throw the lance!

1192
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:26,647
Throw it!

1193
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:34,689
-Throw it! Throw the lance!
-Come on.

1194
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:47,084
Throw it!

1195
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:48,605
Come on.

1196
01:35:57,120 --> 01:35:59,088
Kill it! He's there!

1197
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:00,886
Throw the lance!

1198
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:21,204
Why didn't you kill it?

1199
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:49,570
You're a damn fool.

1200
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:14,890
Currents drew us apart

1201
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:20,168
and that was the last we would see
of Captain Pollard's whale boat.

1202
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,206
A boat!

1203
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:27,204
Broad on the port bow!

1204
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:54,451
May God have mercy.

1205
01:38:37,480 --> 01:38:38,686
Mr. Chase.

1206
01:38:41,240 --> 01:38:43,049
Father!

1207
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:47,167
Don't leave me, Father!

1208
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,445
Mr. Chase.

1209
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:42,405
Mr. Chase.

1210
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:44,881
Sir, look. Look, sir.

1211
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:51,404
Mr. Chase, look.

1212
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:54,569
Wake up, Mr. Chase!

1213
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:56,606
Here, wake up!

1214
01:39:58,200 --> 01:40:00,362
Please wake up, sir, there's land.

1215
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:02,844
Mr. Chase, look.

1216
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:24,605
We were rescued there,

1217
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:27,681
off the island of Más Afuera, Chile,

1218
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,571
90 days after the sinking of the Essex.

1219
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:35,283
They gave us some old clothes.

1220
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:36,851
Fed us, too.

1221
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:40,403
It was hard to eat at first.

1222
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:41,800
Strange.

1223
01:40:43,480 --> 01:40:45,403
They looked after us as best they could

1224
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:47,841
till we found a ship
that would carry us home.

1225
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:51,243
That voyage took another three months.

1226
01:41:00,920 --> 01:41:04,003
It looked like the whole island
turned out to see us return.

1227
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:07,129
But there were no cheers.

1228
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:09,446
Only silence.

1229
01:41:11,120 --> 01:41:14,363
They looked at us like
we were apparitions,

1230
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:16,731
phantoms.

1231
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:22,005
We'd said nothing of the details
of our survival to anyone,

1232
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:25,209
but I wondered if they somehow
knew of our privations.

1233
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:28,690
Maybe they were just curious.

1234
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:09,725
Oh, my God!

1235
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:18,531
I promised, didn't I?

1236
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:27,886
Oh, God.

1237
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:30,727
Hi.

1238
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:33,844
Hey, sweetie. Who's this?

1239
01:42:35,320 --> 01:42:36,446
Phoebe Ann.

1240
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:42,570
Phoebe Ann Chase, huh?

1241
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:45,325
This is Daddy.

1242
01:42:47,320 --> 01:42:48,560
Hey, sweetie.

1243
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:55,365
It's your daddy.

1244
01:43:03,360 --> 01:43:04,646
Oh, my God.

1245
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:14,760
Of course,
they couldn't leave him alone.

1246
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:18,329
Mr. Chase and his wife had
scarcely walked a block towards home

1247
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:21,768
when he was stopped and
made to return to the Maritime office.

1248
01:43:23,240 --> 01:43:26,050
There were business matters
still in question.

1249
01:43:39,800 --> 01:43:41,245
So, to the matter.

1250
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:49,362
Due to the significant loss of life
and property on our voyage,

1251
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,843
it seems there will be an inquiry.

1252
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:54,086
And as captain and first mate,

1253
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:56,208
we will be expected to give an account

1254
01:43:56,360 --> 01:43:57,646
of what happened.

1255
01:43:57,800 --> 01:43:59,086
Yes, of course.

1256
01:43:59,240 --> 01:44:03,643
And having discussed this
with the ship owners and my father,

1257
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:08,526
it is clear that full disclosure
will have ramifications.

1258
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:11,487
Terrible ramifications
for the whole industry.

1259
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:15,161
That a whale brought down the Essex.

1260
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:17,806
But it's the truth.

1261
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:27,962
If the insurance houses and investors

1262
01:44:28,120 --> 01:44:32,967
were to start worrying
about sea monsters sinking ships,

1263
01:44:33,160 --> 01:44:35,367
sailors drawing lots to survive...

1264
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:38,690
We are in the oil business.

1265
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:40,646
All of us.

1266
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:42,486
And as in any business,

1267
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:46,201
the probability of success must
always be greater than the risk incurred.

1268
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:50,808
So, what are you suggesting, George?

1269
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:53,049
That you say the ship ran aground.

1270
01:44:54,120 --> 01:44:55,201
That's a lie.

1271
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:58,569
-And that the men that died, drowned.
-And that's another lie.

1272
01:44:58,840 --> 01:45:00,126
Think on it. They will make you captain.

1273
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:02,408
Well, that pledge I already have
in writing.

1274
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:06,042
Only on the condition
you bring home a ship full of oil.

1275
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,286
This way, it's guaranteed.

1276
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:11,449
You would be a wealthy man.

1277
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:14,965
The name Chase need
no longer be a landsman's name,

1278
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:16,407
but an established name

1279
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:19,291
that belongs among the great families
of Nantucket.

1280
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:22,961
You want me to whitewash
what happened for profit?

1281
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:26,685
We are asking you to be pragmatic.

1282
01:45:42,680 --> 01:45:44,762
The Essex was stove by a white whale.

1283
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,924
And those of us that survived
in ill-equipped whaleboats

1284
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:52,050
had to commit abominations
in order to survive.

1285
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:56,967
And, on our return,
we're expected to spread barefaced lies

1286
01:45:58,120 --> 01:46:00,248
so that you,
the ship owners of Nantucket,

1287
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:04,204
might line your pockets
and sleep well at night?

1288
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:07,442
Well, I will not embroider the truth.

1289
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:10,449
Nor should you, George.

1290
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:32,327
That last time I saw him...

1291
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:33,720
Mr. Chase, sir!

1292
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:37,245
I couldn't find the right words
to say what I wanted to.

1293
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:39,321
Thomas.

1294
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:42,449
Perhaps there are no words.

1295
01:46:42,760 --> 01:46:43,807
Um...

1296
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:48,487
I'm gonna be on my way to Falmouth and...

1297
01:46:51,200 --> 01:46:52,406
It's...

1298
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:56,961
It's been an honor, sir,
to sail with you.

1299
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:03,042
The honor's been mine, Mr. Nickerson.

1300
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:21,367
Here.

1301
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:28,565
Good luck out there, Thomas.

1302
01:47:30,280 --> 01:47:31,520
And you, sir.

1303
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:03,530
Next day, George Pollard was called
before the inquiry.

1304
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:10,080
Gentlemen, Captain George Pollard.

1305
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:13,760
And all the important men
in Nantucket were there.

1306
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:16,524
It was a formality.

1307
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,844
Good day to you, Captain.
Please sit down.

1308
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:27,125
For the record, then...

1309
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:32,080
The Essex was stove by a white whale

1310
01:48:32,240 --> 01:48:34,607
1,200 leagues west of Ecuador.

1311
01:48:35,120 --> 01:48:37,885
It was as if Owen Chase himself
had spoken.

1312
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:41,285
Told them the truth.

1313
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:47,568
Captain Pollard's conscience was clear.

1314
01:48:49,160 --> 01:48:50,286
But the inquiry was a sham.

1315
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:54,201
Pollard went out again,

1316
01:48:57,560 --> 01:48:59,164
looking for the white whale.

1317
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:01,120
He never found it.

1318
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:05,042
He ran a second ship aground off Hawaii.

1319
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:07,800
Twice cursed.

1320
01:49:09,640 --> 01:49:10,687
Never sailed again.

1321
01:49:11,240 --> 01:49:12,321
And Owen Chase?

1322
01:49:14,280 --> 01:49:16,009
He was a man of his word.

1323
01:49:16,840 --> 01:49:19,127
First, he sent a boat back
to Ducie Island.

1324
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:22,051
Mr. Joy had passed.

1325
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:25,969
But the other three were,
incredibly, still alive.

1326
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:30,206
And then?

1327
01:49:31,120 --> 01:49:34,488
And then he packed up his family
and moved to New Bedford.

1328
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:38,005
Started over.

1329
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:40,251
Became a merchant captain,

1330
01:49:41,160 --> 01:49:43,162
sailing on his own terms.

1331
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:55,729
Well, you certainly got your
money's worth, Mr. Melville.

1332
01:49:56,280 --> 01:49:58,760
These February nights
are the longest of the year.

1333
01:49:58,920 --> 01:50:00,843
Well, you can both rest now.

1334
01:50:01,080 --> 01:50:02,411
Believe me,

1335
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:04,688
I shall not be resting for some time.

1336
01:50:05,480 --> 01:50:06,686
Why?

1337
01:50:07,680 --> 01:50:09,284
You got your story.

1338
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:12,366
You know, your plot. It's all there.

1339
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:16,162
Maybe it wasn't a plot I was after.

1340
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:18,530
No. What, then?

1341
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:22,842
-Something else you've given me tonight.
-And what's that?

1342
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:27,811
The courage to go where
one does not want to go.

1343
01:50:29,960 --> 01:50:31,405
Mr. Melville,

1344
01:50:32,120 --> 01:50:34,566
what you've heard, what I've told you,

1345
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:41,725
will it all be of service to your book?

1346
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:46,483
It will be a work of fiction,
Mr. Nickerson,

1347
01:50:47,800 --> 01:50:49,450
inspired by truth.

1348
01:50:51,160 --> 01:50:54,243
But I don't believe
I'll feel the need to use all of it.

1349
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:05,289
-Thank you.
-Here.

1350
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:08,762
-Take that with you.
-No. The money is for you. I insist.

1351
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:11,604
I insist you keep it.

1352
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:15,526
And I insist one person
in this conversation is sober.

1353
01:51:26,440 --> 01:51:29,091
-So it's back to, uh...
-Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

1354
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,490
Well, good luck.

1355
01:51:33,280 --> 01:51:34,441
Thank you.

1356
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:39,286
You know,

1357
01:51:40,160 --> 01:51:43,528
I heard a man from Pennsylvania
drilled a hole in the ground recently

1358
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:46,125
and found oil.

1359
01:51:46,760 --> 01:51:47,966
That can't be true.

1360
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:49,921
I heard it, too.

1361
01:51:52,520 --> 01:51:54,124
Oil from the ground.

1362
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:57,891
Fancy that.
