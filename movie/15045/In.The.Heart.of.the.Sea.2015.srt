1
00:00:04,064 --> 00:00:07,763
The film tells the antiquity where the oil does not come from the drill earth but of Whales.

2
00:00:07,863 --> 00:00:11,163
So that the Seafarers sailing whale hunt to take fat or oil.

3
00:00:11,163 --> 00:00:12,963
And this could make them rich .....

4
00:01:00,864 --> 00:01:11,463


5
00:01:12,564 --> 00:01:16,024
How can you know the unknown?

6
00:01:16,188 --> 00:01:18,772
Do you have any special skills?

7
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:23,900
Since it was found that the whale oil gives us a new product ...

8
00:01:24,064 --> 00:01:27,316
There is a global demand worldwide.

9
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:32,940
This has prompted many people to venture further into uncharted waters.

10
00:01:33,108 --> 00:01:37,900
We do not know the depth of the sea. Both creatures are hidden in there.

11
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:40,108
Monster.

12
00:01:40,272 --> 00:01:42,688
What he really exist?

13
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:56,608
Or just a myth simply to honor the dark secrets of the sea?

14
00:02:03,064 --> 00:02:09,148
NANTUCKET ISLAND - MASSACHUSETTS. February 1850.

15
00:02:09,316 --> 00:02:12,480
The second question, inspired me to make my head spin.

16
00:02:12,648 --> 00:02:16,524
Therefore I call a second meeting.

17
00:02:16,688 --> 00:02:20,688
Conversation with you can be a novel, I intend to write it.

18
00:02:20,856 --> 00:02:23,900
Now it is called: 'Moby Dick'.

19
00:02:24,064 --> 00:02:28,148
I hope you'll reconsider my offer.

20
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:30,148
Unknown.

21
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:35,356
I imagine leading an adventure.

22
00:02:35,524 --> 00:02:38,188
This question continues to haunt.

23
00:02:38,356 --> 00:02:42,188
How can you know something that can not be known?

24
00:02:42,356 --> 00:02:45,940
Sincerely, Herman Melville.

25
00:02:46,108 --> 00:02:47,872
We're closed.

26
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,564
We do not rent rooms after 8 hours.

27
00:02:57,064 --> 00:02:59,440
Sincerely, MR. MELVILLE

28
00:03:00,772 --> 00:03:02,448
You apparently.

29
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,608
- There's someone coming, dear. - Tom Nickerson?

30
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,148
- Herman Melville. - I have received your letter.

31
00:03:23,316 --> 00:03:27,364
You're desperate or stupid, why come here.

32
00:03:29,132 --> 00:03:32,216
All right. My offer is still valid.

33
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,816
Conversation 1 night I paid for 3 months.

34
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:42,024
This is all I have. But I think of it as an investment.

35
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:45,316
You must tell me what happened ...

36
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,980
Boat Essex (whaling).

37
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:56,148
What do you think happened?

38
00:03:56,316 --> 00:03:58,648
There is a rumor ...

39
00:03:58,816 --> 00:04:01,772
Rumor? What story do you want to hear here?

40
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,908
Whale.

41
00:04:06,856 --> 00:04:08,856
Essex ship was sinking.

42
00:04:09,024 --> 00:04:14,400
- That is the result of research. - I have to believe without investigate?

43
00:04:14,564 --> 00:04:16,224
Out!

44
00:04:17,688 --> 00:04:22,356
You are the last victims of the ship Essex Pak. No longer can talk to.

45
00:04:22,524 --> 00:04:26,440
You do not hear me? Get out, now!

46
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:33,232
No. You do not have to go. -I Do not want to talk anymore.

47
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,272
-I Would not waste wasting my time here. -ku Beg you Mr. Melville.

48
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:44,108
He will not talk to me about Essex. Not anyone. He did not want to.

49
00:04:44,272 --> 00:04:47,608
He is suffering.

50
00:04:47,772 --> 00:04:50,108
His soul is shaken ...

51
00:04:50,272 --> 00:04:52,316
... Slumped

52
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,940
And he needed a calming thought.

53
00:04:55,108 --> 00:05:00,024
Please, let me talk to him. I beg you.

54
00:05:04,732 --> 00:05:05,840
My dear...

55
00:05:10,148 --> 00:05:13,648
I believe this will benefit us if you want to speak to him.

56
00:05:13,816 --> 00:05:16,148
No.

57
00:05:18,816 --> 00:05:20,600
Please listen to me!

58
00:05:22,064 --> 00:05:25,648
Do not we keep this house together, while you just sit and drink until we die?

59
00:05:25,816 --> 00:05:31,708
You should talk to this person, then we can save a lot of money.

60
00:05:32,272 --> 00:05:36,856
You know how the situation we are now, Thomas.

61
00:05:46,608 --> 00:05:50,940
I would say that needed it.

62
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,480
I'll take the whiskey first.

63
00:06:01,272 --> 00:06:06,440
I did not mention in the letter, but I never saw the Pope once.

64
00:06:06,608 --> 00:06:08,232
On one trip.

65
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,980
- I'm the Crew. - I see you've been out.

66
00:06:15,148 --> 00:06:18,400
She had been reading a book artwork.

67
00:06:18,564 --> 00:06:23,064
- He really enjoyed it. - I am glad to hear that.

68
00:06:23,232 --> 00:06:25,608
Book my book sold well.

69
00:06:25,772 --> 00:06:31,440
I wrote a story that will now be possible or even surpass the success of my first novel.

70
00:06:31,608 --> 00:06:34,232
Another tale of life at sea?

71
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:41,688
Did you ever read the works of Hawthorne Mr. Melville?

72
00:06:41,856 --> 00:06:44,524
He is an accomplished writer.

73
00:06:44,688 --> 00:06:48,732
- A great writer. - Yes.

74
00:06:50,064 --> 00:06:53,188
But he's not here. There's only me.

75
00:06:53,356 --> 00:06:57,400
Who has personal reasons.

76
00:07:05,188 --> 00:07:09,108
Now I will tell you about Essex. You may be disappointed -

77
00:07:09,272 --> 00:07:12,400
But every word will come true.

78
00:07:12,564 --> 00:07:18,232
Ship Essex story that is the story of two people:

79
00:07:19,232 --> 00:07:24,356
Captain George Pollard and his first mate ...

80
00:07:24,524 --> 00:07:26,732
... Owen Chase.

81
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:31,108
- Owen, do not till late. - I am done.

82
00:07:31,272 --> 00:07:34,232
Our daughter would not be able to sleep if the roof is leaking.

83
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,148
- Who says our children become women? - Yes should lah.

84
00:07:39,316 --> 00:07:42,108
He would remind me of my love for you first.

85
00:07:42,272 --> 00:07:44,980
I hope he like you, not like me.

86
00:07:45,148 --> 00:07:48,772
Brilliant brain and a desire to conquer the world.

87
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,608
- Today you get your captain uniform. - Yes hopefully.

88
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:56,440
Then we can finally move into in the residence of a Captain.

89
00:07:56,608 --> 00:08:01,648
I do not need a big house. There was enough room for three people, it is convenient for us.

90
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:07,608
Sometimes I am overwhelmed by your kindness.

91
00:08:08,608 --> 00:08:11,900
I'll see you become captain.

92
00:08:53,688 --> 00:08:56,400
- Can I bid? - 1.90 dollars.

93
00:08:56,564 --> 00:08:59,608
- 1000 gallons. 2 dollars per gallon. - I bought 40.

94
00:09:01,272 --> 00:09:04,188
Sellers seller .. Here!

95
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,064
Criteria: return with good results is 1600 barrels.

96
00:09:12,232 --> 00:09:17,940
A new record. £ 50 pounds sterling for marketing in London.

97
00:09:18,108 --> 00:09:19,508
Congratulations.

98
00:09:28,688 --> 00:09:33,732
Good morning Mr. Chase. / Mr. Mason. Let's please.

99
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,232
This coworker, Benjamin Fuller.

100
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,316
- Good morning, sir. - Please, sit.

101
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,080
Mr. Chase.

102
00:09:45,648 --> 00:09:51,648
We are very pleased with your efforts over the years. -Thank you sir.

103
00:09:51,816 --> 00:09:58,732
Regarding our ship, Essex, has been renovated and should be sent by sea.

104
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:04,440
After investing so expensive, it must be in the hands of the really best.

105
00:10:04,608 --> 00:10:06,608
Therefore ...

106
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:10,732
... An opportunity for us to tell will be your duty.

107
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,064
As the First Couple.

108
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:18,400
As a First Spouse?

109
00:10:18,564 --> 00:10:22,080
Mr. Mason, you tlah promised me be captain after the last cruise.

110
00:10:22,148 --> 00:10:26,456
I take it home with 1,500 barrels. What do you remember? you have given me a promise.

111
00:10:26,524 --> 00:10:29,772
Promised so does not mean that.

112
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,064
We know, as the same have been through hard times.

113
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:37,400
- Ah was not Ekpedisiku. - Nantucket has dominated the market.

114
00:10:37,564 --> 00:10:39,980
No one can change it.

115
00:10:40,148 --> 00:10:43,316
In this case we do not experiment.

116
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,856
Ship Essex led by George Pollard -

117
00:10:47,024 --> 00:10:50,188
- The descendants of the family of the famous whale catchers.

118
00:10:50,356 --> 00:10:53,608
His father also our investors.

119
00:10:53,772 --> 00:10:59,732
He has a lot of experience, which does have a reliable blood sailor.

120
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:04,732
Yes, but it khan did not take the oil to a ship. A captain must be respected.

121
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:09,124
- What if this man is not reliable? - You make a decision before he did.

122
00:11:09,188 --> 00:11:14,772
- Ah Good afternoon, gentlemen. - I understand your disappointment.

123
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,524
It has been offered to 15 people.

124
00:11:19,688 --> 00:11:22,688
So much, but I have never previously offered the First Couple.

125
00:11:22,856 --> 00:11:28,356
If you get 2,000 barrels of oil, I promise ...

126
00:11:28,524 --> 00:11:31,564
... You will be captain next time.

127
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:35,148
You have promised before, Mr. Mason.

128
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,524
This time I want it in writing.

129
00:11:51,732 --> 00:11:53,232
Captain Pollard.

130
00:11:54,400 --> 00:12:00,900
We just spoke with Mr. Chase, who will be happy to serve you.

131
00:12:01,064 --> 00:12:03,524
Glad to hear it.

132
00:12:03,688 --> 00:12:05,816
Now I like her baby Greenhorn.

133
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,856
A small talented occupant, was born with a silver spoon in his mouth.

134
00:12:10,024 --> 00:12:15,432
- I should say not before him. - Why? You have their word to be written?

135
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,532
Yes. However, the words of a liar does not deserve to be on paper.

136
00:12:29,272 --> 00:12:32,372
You know, I would still love you if you were a ship captain of Commerce.

137
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,188
So you will be gone in two years. - Yes go in 2 years?

138
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:39,900
A whaler home last week after three years.

139
00:12:40,064 --> 00:12:42,980
He lost two people so it's back to the house with a half load.

140
00:12:43,148 --> 00:12:45,356
They do not own in front of the board.

141
00:12:49,816 --> 00:12:52,108
Damn!

142
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:59,900
I would be the captain just one day. In the whaling ship.

143
00:13:00,064 --> 00:13:04,608
We must not be satisfied with a small piece of land.

144
00:13:04,772 --> 00:13:09,356
- That the words of your father, not yours. - What's wrong with his words?

145
00:13:09,524 --> 00:13:12,648
He wanted it for his family and himself.

146
00:13:12,816 --> 00:13:15,900
- He was a dreamer Owen. - Yes.

147
00:13:16,064 --> 00:13:19,524
He dreamed of the sea, but was never allowed to sail.

148
00:13:19,688 --> 00:13:23,356
But at least he witnessed the birth of his child.

149
00:13:30,316 --> 00:13:33,316
I can not.

150
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:38,440
Sorry.

151
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,980
You're not married to the fishing Pope.

152
00:13:48,472 --> 00:13:51,472
Hear.

153
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:56,432
I'll be home as soon as possible. I swear.

154
00:14:04,808 --> 00:14:07,932
Go ..

155
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,832
Promise me.

156
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,180
I swore. Should I swear again?

157
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,432
I promise.

158
00:14:34,888 --> 00:14:36,456
Can I talk to you?

159
00:14:39,224 --> 00:14:42,180
As captain, you can not be a friend.

160
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:47,264
You're their boss. Do not forget it and do not let them forget it.

161
00:14:47,432 --> 00:14:49,064
Thank you sir.

162
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:53,224
Your great-grandparents founded the Pope's fishing industry.

163
00:14:53,388 --> 00:14:57,248
Without us, without you the world will be enveloped in darkness.

164
00:14:58,216 --> 00:15:01,548
I hope to keep the family name Pak.

165
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,632
Oh, Lord, You who created great whales.

166
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:18,380
Nan large long majestic giant. Unrivaled in power and everything.

167
00:15:18,548 --> 00:15:22,048
But the Eternal Thou, even thou pay -

168
00:15:22,216 --> 00:15:26,048
- We are the poor people could go to the sea -

169
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:30,216
- To take us and our wives are also our children -

170
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,924
- With the ups and downs of the fight against the Pope's terrible anger.

171
00:15:36,716 --> 00:15:42,216
Oh, God, Father, may Thy Thy glorious light illuminates on these people.

172
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,716
May they have a trip worthwhile.

173
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,300
Let them return home with a full load -

174
00:15:49,464 --> 00:15:53,464
- White Nantucket Fire into oil -

175
00:15:53,632 --> 00:16:00,172
- Continue to inform our homes, and protect the streets at night -

176
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:06,132
- And supply the machines, which will operate for the nation's future -

177
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,964
- Dan can help the development of mankind.

178
00:16:10,132 --> 00:16:14,008
In Thy Name we pray.

179
00:16:21,324 --> 00:16:25,780
- Good. It was in what? - It is the end of the year.

180
00:16:25,948 --> 00:16:28,780
We sail as one of the last ships.

181
00:16:28,948 --> 00:16:31,880
Therefore, my close personal friend, Barzilai, and I, are involved.

182
00:16:31,948 --> 00:16:35,540
You know, when I was 14 years old.

183
00:16:38,408 --> 00:16:40,256
Hey boy, take the rope, hurry!

184
00:16:40,324 --> 00:16:44,280
This is the first time I go to sea. I'm afraid. But I dare not show it,

185
00:16:44,448 --> 00:16:48,408
Barzilai was 17 years old. We both are orphans.

186
00:16:48,572 --> 00:16:52,864
We are interested in so-called Gentleman.

187
00:16:55,488 --> 00:17:00,156
- Grubs. What is this necklace around her neck? - It is the Pope Bones Thomas.

188
00:17:00,324 --> 00:17:02,448
How to get it?

189
00:17:02,616 --> 00:17:07,824
You should be able to shoot and kill the largest creatures on earth.

190
00:17:07,988 --> 00:17:12,116
Nickerson, quickly reported facing Mr. Bond there.

191
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,308
Hurry up a little, stupid!

192
00:17:15,572 --> 00:17:17,740
One day, I will have 12 seeds like that.

193
00:17:17,908 --> 00:17:20,448
Windlass ready, with a Lynx screen Pak ..

194
00:17:20,616 --> 00:17:23,864
This is only half the supplies we have. -What If Captain angry?

195
00:17:24,032 --> 00:17:26,864
Your presence can only mean one thing. -Yes.

196
00:17:27,032 --> 00:17:30,532
That the people on the boat know the truth about Owen Chase.

197
00:17:30,696 --> 00:17:35,988
- But not for other crew members. - I know. I'm not a new crew, Owen.

198
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:40,296
- But is it you? - Do not tell me Matthew Joy has not dried dibotol?

199
00:17:40,364 --> 00:17:44,032
My already dry in the desert. Is Chase Owen has now softened?

200
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:48,488
- I'm soft as a lamb. - I believe it before you see it.

201
00:17:48,656 --> 00:17:54,532
What about our new captain, it remains no more than 48 hours?

202
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,824
Good luck.

203
00:18:03,032 --> 00:18:06,448
- Pollard. George Pollard.
- Owen Chase.

204
00:18:06,616 --> 00:18:11,280
- Chase. This is the name on the outside of the island? - Yes, right.

205
00:18:11,448 --> 00:18:15,696
We will long be outside the island but sometimes is not long and soon return home.

206
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:18,696
I was a little surprised.

207
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:21,616
Captain usually choose her First Spouse.

208
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,032
Yes, for an experienced captain.

209
00:18:24,196 --> 00:18:26,864
This particular ship owners -

210
00:18:27,032 --> 00:18:30,696
- That the investment they fall into the hands of competent.

211
00:18:30,864 --> 00:18:33,448
They just wanted to be safe.

212
00:18:33,616 --> 00:18:36,988
Oh I do not know, I'm sorry, if I make a mistake.

213
00:18:37,156 --> 00:18:40,448
I also think so Captain.

214
00:18:50,656 --> 00:18:53,948
- Anchor, Mr. Chase. - Develop the screen!

215
00:18:54,116 --> 00:18:57,532
Take the helm, Mr. Lawrence. Ready to sail Mr. Joy.

216
00:18:57,696 --> 00:19:02,196
Hoist the sails. Raise anchor.

217
00:19:02,364 --> 00:19:07,196
Hoist the sails.

218
00:19:07,364 --> 00:19:11,780
Adjusting the screen and the Topsail. Lift anchor!

219
00:19:14,532 --> 00:19:18,324
Set Topsail! Lepaskan gives dan Layar.

220
00:19:18,488 --> 00:19:21,908
There is a knot. - Take the helm, Mr. Chappell.

221
00:19:22,072 --> 00:19:24,616
I can not let go!

222
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,864
Come on. Why are they not ready?

223
00:19:29,032 --> 00:19:32,948
Where Headsailku, Mr. Ray?

224
00:19:33,116 --> 00:19:36,196
Raise the anchor! - Raise the anchor!

225
00:19:36,364 --> 00:19:37,916
Nickerson tarik!

226
00:19:42,408 --> 00:19:47,240
- Set sail, dammit! - The entire island is watching us.

227
00:19:50,948 --> 00:19:54,032
- The anchor is raised! - Head you, Captain.

228
00:19:54,196 --> 00:19:55,872
Beware of your head, Captain!

229
00:19:58,696 --> 00:20:03,988
- What's wrong? - The screen can not be rotated.

230
00:20:04,156 --> 00:20:07,408
- Fins jammed! - Nodes can not be loosened!

231
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:11,908
The screen can not be rolled up.

232
00:20:17,572 --> 00:20:21,656
- Be careful. - It is dangerous, Owen.

233
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,408
Aside.

234
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:42,696
Oh damn!

235
00:20:42,864 --> 00:20:45,696
- Place the home screen! - Pull!

236
00:20:47,364 --> 00:20:49,656
Set sail!

237
00:21:02,156 --> 00:21:05,532
Good work, Mr. Chase.

238
00:21:16,124 --> 00:21:22,916
If we can reach the Cape Verde within 2 weeks, then we can get the Pacific as planned.

239
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:27,424
- Corn, Mr. Chase? - No, thank you sir.

240
00:21:27,488 --> 00:21:32,448
- I never liked it. - Strange.

241
00:21:32,616 --> 00:21:36,408
Your father planted corn khan? - Indeed.

242
00:21:36,572 --> 00:21:39,648
I was tired of eating it every day.

243
00:21:42,156 --> 00:21:46,696
Corn, Okra and beans, right?

244
00:21:47,064 --> 00:21:50,148
Before he was in prison.

245
00:21:50,316 --> 00:21:54,940
- You know the story, Mr. Joy? - Yes, Sir?

246
00:21:55,108 --> 00:21:58,608
Mr. Chase, was an orphan -

247
00:21:58,772 --> 00:22:01,480
- When his father was imprisoned.

248
00:22:01,648 --> 00:22:04,480
Many roads lead to the sea.

249
00:22:04,648 --> 00:22:07,740
We try not to have too many questions.

250
00:22:09,108 --> 00:22:12,272
It is not easy, but ...

251
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:16,564
... He was taken from Nantucket to Seafarers family (adoption).

252
00:22:16,732 --> 00:22:20,732
This is not the first time, I was summoned to the outer islands -

253
00:22:20,896 --> 00:22:26,272
- From Nantucketbo, and talk about my family striped background.

254
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:32,480
Sorry excuse me, I will divide the guards were stationed to supervise the ship.

255
00:22:37,688 --> 00:22:39,688
No sir, thank you.

256
00:22:39,856 --> 00:22:43,108
- Just a little? - No sir.

257
00:22:43,272 --> 00:22:47,816
Like I told you. The fewer questions the better.

258
00:22:55,524 --> 00:22:58,856
Serve food.

259
00:22:59,024 --> 00:23:03,448
It's the first day? - The foods are cheap. Where's the beef?

260
00:23:06,316 --> 00:23:10,816
- Beautiful girl. - Ivory Pieces of Whalebone.

261
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:14,148
- Let me touch it. - Do not.

262
00:23:14,316 --> 00:23:17,896
- Are you married? - Yes, this is it.

263
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:21,232
It's certainly his nose.

264
00:23:21,596 --> 00:23:24,472
Congratulations, dear women.

265
00:23:26,596 --> 00:23:29,308
The division of tasks today.

266
00:23:29,472 --> 00:23:33,640
There is a small group that is not useful.

267
00:23:33,808 --> 00:23:37,640
Mr. Chappell. /Yes, sir. -You AdalahTombak utaman captain.

268
00:23:37,808 --> 00:23:41,596
- Mr. Lawrence. She is mine. - Yes, sir.

269
00:23:41,764 --> 00:23:44,888
Dan Mr. Peterson.

270
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:47,516
- Second Pair Spear. - Yes, Sir.

271
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:51,932
There were six people in each boat. We practice in the morning each day.

272
00:23:52,096 --> 00:23:54,932
We have not even been to the east Halifax Pak.

273
00:23:55,096 --> 00:23:59,180
- Siapa namamu?
- Coffin. Henry Coffin.

274
00:23:59,348 --> 00:24:02,888
She is the daughter of Captain Sir.

275
00:24:03,056 --> 00:24:08,016
Mr. Coffin. Are whales realize it is east of Halifax?

276
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,764
I do not know who you are and how it can here.

277
00:24:13,932 --> 00:24:17,388
Some of you may be running from the law.

278
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:20,388
That's not why. I do not care.

279
00:24:20,556 --> 00:24:25,056
But here on the boat, we are aiming for one thing.

280
00:24:25,224 --> 00:24:27,224
Whale oil.

281
00:24:27,388 --> 00:24:31,808
I intend to fill 2,000 barrels and return home as soon as possible.

282
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:34,848
And even when the weather is fine without the Pope seen Mr. Coffin.-

283
00:24:35,016 --> 00:24:39,972
We keep putting the boat in the water and pretend we catch a whale.

284
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,516
Anyone who did not take part in, swim home. Understand everything?

285
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,308
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

286
00:24:49,388 --> 00:24:53,680
Greenhorn on the boat deck.

287
00:24:56,016 --> 00:24:58,640
Go son.

288
00:24:59,724 --> 00:25:02,180
Ya Pak, land crab.

289
00:25:02,348 --> 00:25:04,808
- Thomas Nickerson, right? - Yes, sir.

290
00:25:04,972 --> 00:25:08,348
You know, there're a pain in the beginning of the trip.

291
00:25:11,224 --> 00:25:14,680
- Pull me! - This is the best medicine son.

292
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:16,848
Pull me up!

293
00:25:20,632 --> 00:25:22,632
Does it help?

294
00:25:23,964 --> 00:25:26,088
Damn.

295
00:25:27,308 --> 00:25:30,096
Sir, I'm really sorry.

296
00:25:30,264 --> 00:25:33,740
Now you have something to be written for the mother at home.

297
00:25:38,224 --> 00:25:42,388
My mother is dead and buried. My father also had a tombstone.

298
00:25:42,556 --> 00:25:46,140
He disappeared at sea, before I was born.

299
00:25:47,308 --> 00:25:49,932
Give it to me.

300
00:25:51,556 --> 00:25:57,348
Compared family boy, we better or worse.

301
00:25:57,516 --> 00:25:59,764
Do not be worse.

302
00:26:01,724 --> 00:26:05,016
Scrubbing the deck, son.

303
00:26:19,888 --> 00:26:23,932
Watchdog. Today you learn to be a hunter Pope.

304
00:26:24,096 --> 00:26:27,596
Take the rope, Nickerson.

305
00:26:27,764 --> 00:26:30,640
We continued until the afternoon if necessary.

306
00:26:30,808 --> 00:26:34,848
- Stay alert. - Prepare Harpoon.

307
00:26:35,016 --> 00:26:37,224
Hold!

308
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:40,224
- You're too slow! - Ship Scoop.

309
00:26:40,588 --> 00:26:44,008
I need to know the boat inside out, before we stop.

310
00:26:47,548 --> 00:26:48,948
Tarik, Barz.

311
00:26:50,716 --> 00:26:55,340
- Faster, Mr. Ray. - He was no longer Greenhorns Mr. Ray!

312
00:26:55,508 --> 00:26:59,340
You're a sailor now.

313
00:27:00,964 --> 00:27:04,296
Passable Mr. Ray, is fine sir.

314
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:07,788
Get used to life as a worker horses.

315
00:27:07,956 --> 00:27:10,580
- Mr. Chase?
- Ya Pak.

316
00:27:10,748 --> 00:27:12,580
Set the screen.

317
00:27:12,748 --> 00:27:15,332
Is it wise sir? We are approaching the Gulf Stream.

318
00:27:15,496 --> 00:27:19,708
- Let us wait for the weather conditions. - We were two days late.

319
00:27:19,872 --> 00:27:22,708
We should be quick to catch in the East Halifax.

320
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:26,872
Set the screen.

321
00:27:29,996 --> 00:27:32,956
Set the screen. Let's move!

322
00:27:33,124 --> 00:27:35,788
Set the screen!

323
00:27:35,956 --> 00:27:39,080
To the top, Mr. Coffin. Captain wants speed!

324
00:27:39,248 --> 00:27:42,416
Prepare braces! Trim the sails!

325
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:46,708
Captain put wind in the sails.

326
00:27:48,496 --> 00:27:53,248
This ship may be old, \ But it can still sail.

327
00:27:53,416 --> 00:27:57,708
Storm on the right. -Must Slows.

328
00:28:17,288 --> 00:28:20,956
Captain put wind in the sails!

329
00:28:21,124 --> 00:28:26,788
This ship may be old, but he can still sail!

330
00:28:34,672 --> 00:28:38,088
Pak, a storm in the right direction. We must reduce speed.

331
00:28:38,456 --> 00:28:40,456
Not yet, anyway Mr. Chase.

332
00:28:40,624 --> 00:28:44,288
Sir, we sail with a speed of 8 knots. The storm is moving faster.

333
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:49,624
Let it hang. People we need a baptism of fire to set sail.

334
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:55,996
If we do not change direction, then the storm will hit us from the side.

335
00:28:56,164 --> 00:28:59,208
Mr. Chase. We constantly.

336
00:28:59,372 --> 00:29:02,040
Mr. Lawrence. Nahkodanya strong resistance.

337
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:06,916
- Ready to withstand sir! - If not so, we lost half a day.

338
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:11,788
If these people can not handle the wind a little bit, we all will be lost.

339
00:29:20,332 --> 00:29:22,416
On alert for sea waves.

340
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:25,540
Bad weather ahead. Make sure all seek.

341
00:29:32,208 --> 00:29:35,832
There will be more severe shocks. Everything remains vigilant.

342
00:29:41,208 --> 00:29:45,208
Get ready for the weather, Mr. Bond. - We sail in one violent storm.

343
00:29:45,372 --> 00:29:48,980
- Close and lock the main door! - The storm is imminent, fast!

344
00:30:03,872 --> 00:30:07,956
- We must change direction. - We continued Mr. Chase.

345
00:30:08,124 --> 00:30:12,832
- Mr Lawrence. Strong resistance nahkodanya! - Ready to withstand Pak.

346
00:30:25,208 --> 00:30:28,372
-Waspadalah To water. - Holdings.

347
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:32,164
- Decrease the screen, Mr. Chase! - Climb up and set are accustomed!

348
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:35,748
During bad weather and survive!

349
00:30:35,916 --> 00:30:40,040
- We had to pull the screen down! - Pull the screen !!

350
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,956
Nickerson grip!

351
00:30:44,124 --> 00:30:46,372
Keeping the ship remains on track.

352
00:30:54,372 --> 00:30:57,208
-Handle. -Rotate Portside.

353
00:30:57,372 --> 00:31:00,832
Do not. Damage will occur later.

354
00:31:00,996 --> 00:31:05,208
- Let the display run! - No, follow the path of his ship.

355
00:31:05,372 --> 00:31:08,316
Too late! we are at risk of reverse bitch!

356
00:31:17,496 --> 00:31:21,916
- Wait! - Let the display run!

357
00:31:28,496 --> 00:31:30,872
Handle!

358
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,624
Watch out!

359
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:24,248
Mr. Joy!

360
00:32:24,416 --> 00:32:28,748
Cut the halyard! Ships must be balanced!

361
00:33:23,132 --> 00:33:26,548
You will talk to Pak?

362
00:33:26,716 --> 00:33:31,216
At 6 o'clock tomorrow to collect the crew -

363
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:35,132
- And to announce that we are back, so that the ship was soon rectified.

364
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,716
Convey ask forgiveness for them, because they had doubted to Kaptenanmu -

365
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,672
- That was almost snatched all their lives Crew today. -What?

366
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:46,964
I accept your resignation. For the sake of all.

367
00:33:47,132 --> 00:33:51,008
- You ordered a set screen. - Yes.

368
00:33:51,172 --> 00:33:54,008
- The crew must be tested. - In the middle of a storm?

369
00:33:54,172 --> 00:33:57,464
- But we survived, right? - It was a bad seamanship.

370
00:33:57,632 --> 00:34:00,380
To call it bad luck and weak.

371
00:34:00,548 --> 00:34:04,172
It was too much! You know who you're talking to?

372
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:07,548
My name is Captain George Pollard.

373
00:34:07,716 --> 00:34:09,180
Pollard!

374
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:17,800
And you Mr. Chase does not matter how much knowledge you have, but you're just a farm boy -

375
00:34:17,964 --> 00:34:21,300
Who actually had to force officers to wear uniforms?

376
00:34:22,588 --> 00:34:24,324
Now get out!

377
00:34:27,548 --> 00:34:31,964
Back with a little oil would be a mistake sir.

378
00:34:32,132 --> 00:34:35,132
It is not fitting for a man named Pollard.

379
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,840
Chase or not, in this case the same.

380
00:34:38,008 --> 00:34:41,840
We must work hard in all the time that God has given us.

381
00:34:42,008 --> 00:34:44,840
- Fill the vessel with oil, returned home for a year -

382
00:34:45,008 --> 00:34:47,880
- And let it split up after it.

383
00:34:49,964 --> 00:34:53,508
Believe me, that's what they want you.

384
00:34:57,216 --> 00:35:00,964
But, of course, the captain who decides.

385
00:35:10,172 --> 00:35:12,924
It felt like a couple that is not harmonious.

386
00:35:14,548 --> 00:35:17,424
Couples who do not harmonized may still be tolerated Mr. Melville.

387
00:35:17,588 --> 00:35:20,756
But if the couple sailed, difficult to reconcile.

388
00:35:20,924 --> 00:35:24,424
- Are you married Mr. Melville? - Yes.

389
00:35:24,588 --> 00:35:28,424
- God bless you. - We expect our first child.

390
00:35:28,588 --> 00:35:32,756
When your wife bring the whole luck tonight -

391
00:35:32,924 --> 00:35:35,588
What would you give to a stranger?

392
00:35:35,756 --> 00:35:39,672
- No sir. - She is the wife of surprises.

393
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,924
So...

394
00:35:42,088 --> 00:35:47,132
- Essex did not have a home to go back? - No.

395
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,800
- He sailed? - Yes.

396
00:35:49,964 --> 00:35:55,924
Not long after the time comes, in which all who are called hunters Pope see ...

397
00:35:56,924 --> 00:35:59,424
Pause....

398
00:35:59,588 --> 00:36:01,756
Pause!

399
00:36:01,924 --> 00:36:05,340
There the Pope!

400
00:36:05,508 --> 00:36:11,508
North Atlantic where the Pope Mr. Ramsdell. - Small whales.

401
00:36:11,672 --> 00:36:14,340
Mr. Chase, skocinya to lower the water!

402
00:36:14,508 --> 00:36:19,632
- All hands on deck! - All hands on deck!

403
00:36:21,924 --> 00:36:24,048
Lower the lifeboat into the water.

404
00:36:25,508 --> 00:36:27,632
Lower the lifeboat into the water.!

405
00:36:32,548 --> 00:36:35,924
NORTH ATLANTIC OCEAN. 3 months at sea.

406
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:57,048
Move on! all the power is in your arms.

407
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:02,132
Come on! Let them on your arm.

408
00:37:04,132 --> 00:37:07,048
Yes, they gush.

409
00:37:07,216 --> 00:37:10,672
Give all you can.

410
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,964
Come on, use all your strength.

411
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,632
Give all you can.

412
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,088
Pause!

413
00:37:23,256 --> 00:37:24,888
That calf!

414
00:37:28,464 --> 00:37:32,548
- That calf? - Yes, it's calf.

415
00:37:42,008 --> 00:37:45,008
This is where children, we get the money!

416
00:37:45,172 --> 00:37:47,188
Nickerson, paddle! -I'm Sorry, sir.

417
00:37:47,256 --> 00:37:50,172
- 40-barrel? - 50!

418
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:55,008
He was great! We skip him.

419
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:57,508
Fight until your lungs burst.

420
00:37:57,672 --> 00:38:02,008
Full speed! Remove all the power!

421
00:38:02,172 --> 00:38:04,340
Pay attention to your belt!

422
00:38:04,508 --> 00:38:07,632
- Prepare the rope for the Pope, Mr. Ramsdell. - Yes, Sir.

423
00:38:10,132 --> 00:38:11,864
The first pope is mine.

424
00:38:13,932 --> 00:38:15,932
Take me over.

425
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:20,924
Scoop! Come on, move on.

426
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:41,300
You get, now sledding children.

427
00:38:41,464 --> 00:38:42,788
Oh, God!

428
00:38:54,256 --> 00:38:58,024
Look at him! The most feared creatures on Earth.

429
00:39:08,048 --> 00:39:10,880
It's a dive.

430
00:39:12,588 --> 00:39:14,008
Oh my!

431
00:39:21,548 --> 00:39:24,300
Let the rope, Nickerson.

432
00:39:29,508 --> 00:39:31,508
Let the contents of the water!

433
00:39:36,672 --> 00:39:40,508
We have 140 fathoms Mr. Chase.

434
00:39:48,508 --> 00:39:50,448
Stay 80 fathoms sir!

435
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,916
He pulls us down!

436
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,532
Matthew, I need Talimu!

437
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:07,048
Peterson, give me the rope! /Yes, Sir. - Give me the rope Peterson!

438
00:40:07,216 --> 00:40:09,508
There are 60 fathoms sir!

439
00:40:11,588 --> 00:40:13,924
- 20 fathoms! - Tie together.

440
00:40:17,132 --> 00:40:20,756
- Ready! - Now!

441
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,748
Peterson took control. - Yes, Sir.

442
00:40:35,716 --> 00:40:40,756
- How many fathoms of rope left? - There are 70 fathoms Pak.

443
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:45,588
No, do not wait!

444
00:40:48,756 --> 00:40:51,380
- Owen! - No, not yet!

445
00:40:51,548 --> 00:40:56,008
Do not touch the rope. - Stay around 50 fathoms Pak.

446
00:40:57,424 --> 00:41:00,340
- Owen bitch! - I said do not touch.

447
00:41:00,508 --> 00:41:03,216
30 fathoms, Mr. Joy!

448
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,308
Only 10 fathoms, sir.

449
00:41:44,016 --> 00:41:46,972
Cut the rope.

450
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,808
Come scoop!

451
00:41:54,308 --> 00:41:57,724
- Chimney smoky fire! - Chimney smoky fire!

452
00:41:57,888 --> 00:42:01,432
Burn !!

453
00:42:31,808 --> 00:42:38,016
Come on, quickly. -Go You, asshole.

454
00:42:52,132 --> 00:42:54,924
Fats and oils. -Could You kiss her children?

455
00:42:55,088 --> 00:43:00,132
It's the smell of money. - Get out of here sharks bitch!

456
00:43:01,964 --> 00:43:04,224
- Can you get? - No.

457
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,172
- How it looks? - Not good.

458
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,356
Only that.

459
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,672
- Mr. Chase?
- Ya.

460
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:25,216
- We're not able to do even more. - Then dig continues Son, let's move on!

461
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:30,340
- I'm too big, I can not go in there. - Then go can.

462
00:43:34,708 --> 00:43:36,716
Nickerson, come here boy!

463
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,832
Hey, I said come over here ..

464
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:47,288
Go down into there.

465
00:43:47,456 --> 00:43:53,124
Come on, Thomas, the most valuable is down.

466
00:43:56,872 --> 00:44:02,416
Sir, I can not. Sorry I can not.

467
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:07,540
You have to go down there, if not, then you have to sleep there.

468
00:44:07,708 --> 00:44:10,788
Place it between your teeth son.

469
00:44:10,956 --> 00:44:13,924
This idea is worse than going down there.

470
00:44:17,416 --> 00:44:18,816
thanks.

471
00:44:23,456 --> 00:44:28,416
- Sorry. - Hey Nickerson, take a pillow if you want to enter!

472
00:44:30,372 --> 00:44:32,040
Now you're down.

473
00:44:47,248 --> 00:44:51,332
I learned to recognize themselves in there.

474
00:44:52,748 --> 00:44:57,664
- You ever get into the head of the Pope? - No, indeed I avoid.

475
00:44:57,832 --> 00:45:01,124
You know, in all of them gold.

476
00:45:02,708 --> 00:45:06,372
I will never forget the first pope.

477
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:11,500
47 barrels of oil. But the joy was not long.

478
00:45:11,664 --> 00:45:15,832
- Does the Pope has run out in a hurry? - Yes I think so.

479
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,248
Therefore we continue the voyage.

480
00:45:21,416 --> 00:45:25,680
We took one month to reach Cape Horn.

481
00:45:27,248 --> 00:45:30,372
We left the Atlantic with hopeful

482
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:33,508
- To change the fate better.

483
00:45:34,372 --> 00:45:37,616
But reaching the Pacific do not improve our situation.

484
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:43,224
We observed, whales are rarely seen.

485
00:45:45,124 --> 00:45:46,932
After nearly a year at sea -

486
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:51,540
- Relationship captain and her First Spouse increasingly tense.

487
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,164
Captain spends much of his time in his cabin.

488
00:45:56,332 --> 00:45:59,416
He did not dare look at the faces of his crew.

489
00:46:04,332 --> 00:46:07,956
Our cargo room was almost empty.

490
00:46:08,124 --> 00:46:11,264
Looking at the results of our efforts print-

491
00:46:11,532 --> 00:46:17,240
- Reminding us it was time to return home.

492
00:46:29,916 --> 00:46:32,824
ATACAMES - ECUADOR.

493
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:42,116
No. I do not understand your language.

494
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:45,616
- Speak English. - Offer more.

495
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:52,156
This is Nantucket whale oil. The wild boar is not feasible anymore.

496
00:47:09,172 --> 00:47:11,880
Chairman asserted, we must write home about.

497
00:47:12,048 --> 00:47:15,048
Who will help? A widow?

498
00:47:15,216 --> 00:47:17,588
The ship owner is gone?

499
00:47:17,756 --> 00:47:23,216
How long will you live in hiding Captain?

500
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:29,256
Write home about and asked for forgiveness on behalf of the crew and captain.

501
00:47:29,424 --> 00:47:33,008
No one can prevent what happened there.

502
00:47:33,172 --> 00:47:37,008
And who would believe it? No. Not at all investors.

503
00:47:37,172 --> 00:47:41,048
Over the years, whale oil they make them very rich.

504
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,080
Captain? Excuse me.

505
00:47:47,148 --> 00:47:50,400
I heard that your ship was attacked, sir?

506
00:47:50,564 --> 00:47:52,900
Kapten George Pollard, Kapal Essex.

507
00:47:53,064 --> 00:47:57,524
Captain Clemente Pelaez, ship Santa Maria.

508
00:47:57,688 --> 00:48:00,232
Do you want to drink something?

509
00:48:05,272 --> 00:48:07,816
No, no.

510
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:11,816
You're exposed to accidents huh? How far?

511
00:48:12,816 --> 00:48:17,856
- As far as fools roam. - And how far is it?

512
00:48:18,024 --> 00:48:21,440
1000 km of along the equator.

513
00:48:21,608 --> 00:48:24,064
Offshore Grounds.

514
00:48:24,232 --> 00:48:28,856
- Do you have a whale there? -More Than I imagined.

515
00:48:29,024 --> 00:48:33,524
Hundreds, as far as the eye can see.

516
00:48:33,688 --> 00:48:36,856
We could fill 3,000 barrels a day.

517
00:48:37,024 --> 00:48:39,832
The point can we have?

518
00:48:42,732 --> 00:48:46,524
For the animal can not.

519
00:48:46,688 --> 00:48:51,400
A Pope, white like Alabaster.

520
00:48:51,564 --> 00:48:54,688
It was 100 meters long.

521
00:48:54,856 --> 00:48:58,316
It has sent six crew my ship to the grave.

522
00:49:05,472 --> 00:49:09,932
The rest of us just have unforgettable memories.

523
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:16,264
Now if I take these white whales, what your money remains dikantongmu?

524
00:49:19,548 --> 00:49:21,116
thanks.

525
00:49:25,016 --> 00:49:26,548
Do you believe it?

526
00:49:29,288 --> 00:49:34,288
If we sail now, will be retained in the Southeast and time consuming -

527
00:49:34,456 --> 00:49:37,372
So we are outside the home plus 6 months.

528
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:43,040
What do you say Mr. Chase? We had to stay longer than necessary?

529
00:49:43,208 --> 00:49:47,040
I'm an Advocate. -He An Advocate.

530
00:49:47,208 --> 00:49:51,456
Our captain and first mate is getting greedy.

531
00:49:51,624 --> 00:49:56,788
So we will sail, out of the 1000 league along the equator.

532
00:49:56,956 --> 00:50:01,248
Where all that knowledge away and speculation took over.

533
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:07,540
Here the Pope had been displaced. Far from human.

534
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:09,748
But we still find them.

535
00:50:10,872 --> 00:50:16,956
Previous centuries feared sailors sailing on the brink.

536
00:50:17,124 --> 00:50:21,456
We, on the other hand, is running against insanity.

537
00:50:24,248 --> 00:50:29,124
Faith was replaced by doubt. Hope was replaced by superstition.

538
00:50:29,388 --> 00:50:32,348
Captain, Crew wants to talk.

539
00:50:33,316 --> 00:50:37,400
- What can I do? - They are not satisfied with the decision.

540
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,400
Do not you criticize them?

541
00:50:40,564 --> 00:50:43,708
Did you know, we have set out to fill the board with as many whale oil.

542
00:50:43,772 --> 00:50:46,400
We are sailing wherever necessary.

543
00:50:46,564 --> 00:50:50,316
Cousin ... Please ...

544
00:50:51,608 --> 00:50:52,988
This is crazy.

545
00:50:53,188 --> 00:50:55,388
You let yourself be influenced by the Crew.

546
00:50:57,356 --> 00:50:59,772
We ship must go home.

547
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:04,064
Now, go down and make sure the crew.

548
00:51:04,232 --> 00:51:06,608
Be a leader.

549
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:12,688
And do not ever call me again kinship.

550
00:51:12,856 --> 00:51:15,856
Mr. Coffin.

551
00:51:25,428 --> 00:51:28,972
OFFSHORE GROUNDS 14 months at sea

552
00:51:44,344 --> 00:51:47,180
- What's up? - Listen!

553
00:51:47,344 --> 00:51:49,636
Mr. Chase? I saw the white water!

554
00:51:49,804 --> 00:51:52,720
- Where? - Over there!

555
00:51:52,888 --> 00:51:55,796
- Where is it? - Can you see?

556
00:52:02,096 --> 00:52:06,056
- Lower the lifeboat boat! - Lower the lifeboat boat!

557
00:52:07,764 --> 00:52:10,596
That the waters of Mexico.

558
00:52:49,636 --> 00:52:54,764
- Lift the paddle! - Spear him Mr. Chappell.

559
00:52:54,928 --> 00:52:56,804
Spears him!

560
00:53:01,304 --> 00:53:04,680
Straight ahead, Peterson.

561
00:53:14,556 --> 00:53:18,556
Do not let them cut off your arm children. Continue!

562
00:53:41,388 --> 00:53:44,928
- White Pope? - Yes.

563
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:50,472
- So it's true? - Yes, very true.

564
00:53:50,636 --> 00:53:53,680
Behind the boat.

565
00:54:07,764 --> 00:54:09,596
Faster!

566
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:29,544
Mr. Bond! Lower the speed back.

567
00:54:29,712 --> 00:54:33,796
Here it comes, now, Peterson!

568
00:54:46,044 --> 00:54:50,172
Mr Lawrence. Sailing towards whale Pak.

569
00:54:50,336 --> 00:54:54,044
- Beware of heat. - We will find it.

570
00:54:57,164 --> 00:55:01,164
We're close, already on his back, a spear!

571
00:55:10,912 --> 00:55:12,672
We have it!

572
00:55:44,204 --> 00:55:46,188
What is Mr .. Lawrence?

573
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:52,012
Mr. Chase!

574
00:56:00,288 --> 00:56:02,956
Damn! find again Mr. Lawr ...

575
00:56:28,636 --> 00:56:29,828
Mr. Easton!

576
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:48,996
Take the water pump Mr. Lawrence, to drain!

577
00:56:49,764 --> 00:56:52,244
- Where is he? - Over there!

578
00:57:04,556 --> 00:57:06,496
Give me the biggest pike that we have.

579
00:57:10,604 --> 00:57:11,912
You want to fight?

580
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:25,112
I have never seen the Pope for it. - Mr. Lawrence nahkodanya control.

581
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:29,056
Mr. Ramsdell, attach the rope on the gallows. - Yes, sir.

582
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,888
As long as I live, she was mine.

583
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:38,988
Oh shit.

584
00:58:17,836 --> 00:58:20,920
- The rope sped! - Look out!

585
00:59:13,256 --> 00:59:17,072
- Captain. - See ship Essex, the screen collapsed.

586
00:59:28,928 --> 00:59:30,396
We're back!

587
01:00:06,764 --> 01:00:12,012
- Help me! - Give me your hand! Nickerson!

588
01:00:47,596 --> 01:00:49,036
Mr. Chase!

589
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:54,928
A Pope Pak, crashed into the ship.

590
01:00:55,096 --> 01:00:58,112
- What? - We lost Mr. Easton and Sanborn.

591
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:05,428
The water pump does not work sir.

592
01:01:10,804 --> 01:01:14,304
- Ready to abandon ship. - We can not go home.

593
01:01:14,472 --> 01:01:17,680
We must take a screen collapsed and set it up again.

594
01:01:18,044 --> 01:01:23,796
Take all the food and water. We need plenty of fresh water.

595
01:01:23,964 --> 01:01:26,544
Take all as much as you can. - Barz here !.

596
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:36,464
- Gosh. - Sailing with the first supply.

597
01:01:36,628 --> 01:01:39,480
Take as much food as you can.

598
01:01:41,544 --> 01:01:47,004
Fast fast .. There are some crates on the deck. - Did you hold?

599
01:01:47,172 --> 01:01:51,380
- It can still be used dry. - Lower the screen.

600
01:01:51,544 --> 01:01:55,464
- Lower pelan2. - Wait.

601
01:01:55,628 --> 01:01:59,544
- Put on the floor. - Hold it!

602
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:08,880
Come on, Nickerson.

603
01:02:11,704 --> 01:02:13,312
Boat chase.

604
01:02:15,828 --> 01:02:17,372
Lower on the floor!

605
01:02:19,036 --> 01:02:24,328
We will need the screen. We do not have enough fresh water.

606
01:02:27,288 --> 01:02:30,872
- Can be a lot of barrels now. - Take it all.

607
01:02:31,036 --> 01:02:36,536
- There are plenty of fresh water. - There are some crates on the deck.

608
01:02:36,704 --> 01:02:40,912
- Benjamin.Tarik him! - Wherever I reach you!

609
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:42,804
- Biscuits! - Fast.

610
01:02:52,956 --> 01:02:57,204
- We have to go out of oil! - Caution slippery.

611
01:02:57,372 --> 01:03:01,456
- Where Mr. Chase? - He was here earlier. /Come on, quickly!

612
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:04,956
- Owen! - We have to go!

613
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:07,872
- Come on! - Oil on deck!

614
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:12,244
- Kapten!
- Mr. Chase!

615
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:34,456
- Mr. Chase!
- Owen!

616
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:36,928
- Where's My First Couple? - Mr. Chase!

617
01:03:46,536 --> 01:03:49,580
- Owen! - We have to go!

618
01:03:49,744 --> 01:03:53,328
No, wait! Mr. Chase!

619
01:03:55,372 --> 01:03:58,080
Mr. Chase!

620
01:04:41,036 --> 01:04:43,328
Thats it!

621
01:04:46,204 --> 01:04:49,412
- Here! - Mr. Chase!

622
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:51,788
Move!

623
01:04:51,956 --> 01:04:55,036
Mr. Chase. Here!

624
01:04:55,204 --> 01:04:57,580
I know, I got you.

625
01:04:57,744 --> 01:04:59,536
Alright Mr. Chase.

626
01:05:04,372 --> 01:05:09,164
- Should we go fishing? - Just cleaning Mr. Joy.

627
01:05:19,704 --> 01:05:22,872
Paddle any further, afraid he pulls us down.

628
01:06:57,912 --> 01:07:01,872
2000 MILES. EAST SOUTH AMERICA

629
01:07:06,164 --> 01:07:11,620
Captain? How is supply?

630
01:07:16,328 --> 01:07:21,704
60 grams of biscuits per person. And 1 cup of water.

631
01:07:25,288 --> 01:07:28,112
We can not survive with it.

632
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:46,836
Thats it.

633
01:07:51,956 --> 01:07:53,580
Yes, it was him.

634
01:07:56,912 --> 01:08:00,788
Kau tak bisa membodohiku, Mr. Chase.
- Mr. Coffin?

635
01:08:01,256 --> 01:08:06,536
- Yes, right. You are for us here, you know we're going this way.

636
01:08:06,704 --> 01:08:10,012
- Put that gun! - Admit it that you're afraid!

637
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:12,164
- What are you doing? - Mr. Coffin, put the gun!

638
01:08:12,328 --> 01:08:16,580
- You know what happens if we run out of food and water. - Do as the Captain said Coffin!

639
01:08:16,744 --> 01:08:19,912
- I just wanted to see the land crabs fear. - Ku said put the gun, this is an order!

640
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:23,620
- Do as the Captain said, now! - Tell! Henry. Say!

641
01:08:23,788 --> 01:08:25,744
Say!

642
01:08:25,912 --> 01:08:29,044
Henry! Put the gun!

643
01:08:33,536 --> 01:08:36,996
Henry! Place!

644
01:09:13,244 --> 01:09:15,244
We finally headed east.

645
01:09:15,412 --> 01:09:18,744
Back towards where we came first.

646
01:09:18,912 --> 01:09:22,872
With only the help of the sun and compass.

647
01:09:23,036 --> 01:09:25,580
Everything looks the same direction.

648
01:09:25,744 --> 01:09:28,872
Our hope arrived in the west and heading to Easter Island.

649
01:09:30,372 --> 01:09:33,704
A journey of nearly 3000 km.

650
01:09:33,872 --> 01:09:38,244
In 12 weeks we sailed south. 6 South latitude ..

651
01:09:38,712 --> 01:09:42,004
We do not close at all to Easter Island.

652
01:09:42,172 --> 01:09:44,072
We have not moved moved.

653
01:09:46,836 --> 01:09:48,488
We damned.

654
01:09:49,256 --> 01:09:52,196
We walked to the right on the right wind.

655
01:09:54,544 --> 01:09:57,380
We will arrive.

656
01:10:26,544 --> 01:10:29,920
Chappell!

657
01:10:30,088 --> 01:10:34,460
- Chappell! - He's already taken the captain!

658
01:10:39,212 --> 01:10:42,380
Mr. Joy we are stuck!

659
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:48,044
Mr. Joy! You're alright Mr. Joy?

660
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:57,128
- Get the paddles! Download! - Matthew!

661
01:10:57,296 --> 01:11:00,380
Pull the screen down.

662
01:11:29,052 --> 01:11:32,928
Matthew. What happened?

663
01:11:33,096 --> 01:11:35,136
Owen. What are you doing here?

664
01:11:35,304 --> 01:11:37,512
- Let me see it. - Do not.

665
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:43,552
- I am fine. - I know, but I want to see it.

666
01:11:46,096 --> 01:11:49,680
I hit my head. It was only a scratch, right?

667
01:11:49,844 --> 01:11:52,260
- Give him water. - No, I do not need water.

668
01:11:52,428 --> 01:11:57,468
- Give him the fucking water! - No, I do not need, I'm alright.

669
01:12:04,596 --> 01:12:06,680
Hold this.

670
01:12:06,844 --> 01:12:11,344
Hey, I've got you, got nothing.

671
01:12:16,844 --> 01:12:21,468
What do you see? I am fine. Hey how, like a hawk khan?

672
01:12:21,636 --> 01:12:24,512
Like an eagle bastard, you hear me?

673
01:12:25,512 --> 01:12:29,636
Owen. I'm fine. Really? I'm fine.

674
01:12:29,804 --> 01:12:34,136
Yes, right. - I am fine. Let's go from here.

675
01:12:34,304 --> 01:12:39,720
He is fine. Let's go.

676
01:12:39,888 --> 01:12:42,636
Why waste water on the people who will die?

677
01:12:42,804 --> 01:12:48,096
They have known each other and sailed together since childhood.

678
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:52,760
Tell me, what you could only find, while your brother died?

679
01:12:52,928 --> 01:12:56,844
This is simple logic, Mr. Chappell.

680
01:12:57,012 --> 01:13:00,136
Bekal, nothing is enough for us all.

681
01:13:10,304 --> 01:13:14,304
Why waste water on the people who will die?

682
01:13:14,468 --> 01:13:16,344
Why waste waste water ..?

683
01:13:16,512 --> 01:13:19,804
Why waste waste water ..? Why?

684
01:13:19,968 --> 01:13:24,012
- Why waste water on the people who will die? - Mr. Nickerson?

685
01:13:25,012 --> 01:13:27,220
- Why waste water ...? - Are you okay, sir?

686
01:13:27,388 --> 01:13:30,720
- I can not. - Can not what?

687
01:13:30,888 --> 01:13:34,680
Now you already know enough. More than enough.

688
01:13:34,844 --> 01:13:38,012
- Sir we've had so far. - It ends here.

689
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:41,220
- We have a deal, Sir. - Take your money and go!

690
01:13:41,388 --> 01:13:44,344
- This agreement devil. - No sir.

691
01:13:44,512 --> 01:13:48,180
The devil loves a secret that is not revealed.

692
01:13:49,968 --> 01:13:54,596
Especially people who were captured and tortured.

693
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,344
What secret?

694
01:14:15,768 --> 01:14:19,352
I'm not a great writer.

695
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:22,420
I do not Si Hawthorne.

696
01:14:23,220 --> 01:14:28,596
But from the first moment, this story haunts.

697
01:14:29,928 --> 01:14:32,804
It has become an obsession.

698
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:35,536
I'm afraid if you do not write it ...

699
01:14:36,804 --> 01:14:39,560
... I will never write again.

700
01:14:39,928 --> 01:14:41,268
What else?

701
01:14:43,136 --> 01:14:46,552
I'm afraid if you do not write it ...

702
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:51,512
So it is not good, as it should be.

703
01:14:59,636 --> 01:15:02,552
Continue the story Pak.

704
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:05,720
For both of us.

705
01:15:12,844 --> 01:15:16,012
34 DAYS OF STRANDED

706
01:15:21,012 --> 01:15:23,136
Share.

707
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:29,596
thanks.

708
01:15:33,888 --> 01:15:36,968
Lord, we thank you for this food.

709
01:15:37,968 --> 01:15:42,720
- Sorry. - Our life, health, everything is good.

710
01:15:42,888 --> 01:15:47,844
- Leave it all ... - Pulau! Island!

711
01:15:48,012 --> 01:15:53,012
- Island! - Island! Island!

712
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:56,928
Paddle! Come paddle!

713
01:15:57,096 --> 01:16:00,636
Paddle! Come paddle!

714
01:16:00,804 --> 01:16:02,712
Mainland!

715
01:16:07,512 --> 01:16:10,468
- I see, Mr. Chase. - Yes, you did!

716
01:16:20,136 --> 01:16:23,180
Hold on. Stop!

717
01:16:24,512 --> 01:16:29,968
- Mr. Chase, what do you mean? - Mr. Chase, why did you stop fuck?

718
01:16:30,136 --> 01:16:33,760
- He's been following us. - What? What do you see?

719
01:16:33,928 --> 01:16:38,344
- There is not anything there Mr. Chase, no! - Sir, what are you doing?

720
01:16:52,804 --> 01:16:55,052
He came, holding!

721
01:16:56,220 --> 01:16:58,928
No!

722
01:17:21,712 --> 01:17:23,212
Where is he?

723
01:19:24,704 --> 01:19:26,788
This could be a Ducie Island.

724
01:19:26,952 --> 01:19:32,952
Without a map we can not know for sure. We let the fire alive day and night.

725
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:37,452
Who knew there was a passing ship and saw smoke.

726
01:20:33,452 --> 01:20:36,444
I want you to see this.

727
01:20:43,996 --> 01:20:49,120
They are here in a long time. They are waiting for the ship.

728
01:20:49,288 --> 01:20:51,296
But no ship came.

729
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:58,380
There will never be ships coming, so if we live, we die.

730
01:20:58,444 --> 01:21:04,360
How long does it take until the bird will find that the eggs they eat?

731
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:26,780
It is a special thing to know, when one dies ...

732
01:21:26,944 --> 01:21:29,988
... And so we can prepare.

733
01:21:30,152 --> 01:21:34,112
But we condemned away from home ...

734
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:38,904
... Without being able to say goodbye and peace ...

735
01:21:39,068 --> 01:21:42,944
And without the opportunity to settle the bill.

736
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:50,488
So let's at least make the calculation of a captain.

737
01:21:50,652 --> 01:21:52,652
Captain of what?

738
01:21:52,820 --> 01:21:55,780
Yes, because this is not the fault of the sinking of the Essex yours.

739
01:21:55,944 --> 01:21:59,988
- I am also responsible. - You're not the captain.

740
01:22:03,236 --> 01:22:06,568
But you were born for this job.

741
01:22:06,736 --> 01:22:09,696
I was just born as the first born.

742
01:22:21,820 --> 01:22:24,860
What we have done, George?

743
01:22:25,028 --> 01:22:29,112
What we have done is offensive to God?

744
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:32,488
Only the Pope had insulted God.

745
01:22:32,652 --> 01:22:36,236
Are we not?

746
01:22:36,404 --> 01:22:39,860
With arrogance and greed we? Look where we are now.

747
01:22:40,028 --> 01:22:43,736
We are creatures created in the Superior RupaTuhan.

748
01:22:43,904 --> 01:22:49,404
King of the Jews, whose job it is to sail around the world.

749
01:22:49,568 --> 01:22:52,360
And bring a new realm, I will do it.

750
01:22:52,528 --> 01:22:57,236
Do you feel as King of the World after all we've been through this?

751
01:22:57,404 --> 01:23:02,404
We do not what to do. We are just small details in a pile of sand.

752
01:23:02,768 --> 01:23:05,896
We sailed towards the sun at dawn.

753
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:11,144
If we must die, may be guided by the Grace of God.

754
01:23:11,312 --> 01:23:14,204
... Let us die like human beings.

755
01:23:24,644 --> 01:23:27,396
- Are you ready Mr. Weeks? - Yes, Sir.

756
01:23:34,728 --> 01:23:39,544
- Mr. Chappell? Mr. Wright? - I can not.

757
01:23:40,312 --> 01:23:42,728
I and Weeks ...

758
01:23:43,396 --> 01:23:45,104
... Stay here.

759
01:23:53,060 --> 01:23:56,104
Are you ready to go, Matthew?

760
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:09,228
- I will help you. - There is no point.

761
01:24:09,396 --> 01:24:12,604
- We're going home. - There is no point.

762
01:24:12,768 --> 01:24:15,896
Go you.

763
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:20,768
Damn you, Matthew.

764
01:24:23,436 --> 01:24:25,768
It's nothing.

765
01:24:25,936 --> 01:24:30,852
I will send a boat for you. Then you went and we met in Nantucket, ok?

766
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:35,228
- Yes, agreed. - Good.

767
01:24:40,688 --> 01:24:43,644
Should I open it for you?

768
01:24:46,228 --> 01:24:51,520
I am fine. It is enough if needed.

769
01:24:54,936 --> 01:24:58,104
God be with you, my brother ...

770
01:24:58,268 --> 01:25:01,020
And you.

771
01:25:18,896 --> 01:25:24,020
Brother Peterson? You're coming with us?

772
01:25:24,188 --> 01:25:27,812
Mr. Peterson, here in the boat Mr. Bond ..

773
01:25:55,812 --> 01:25:58,644
48 DAYS STRANDED.

774
01:26:00,684 --> 01:26:03,308
Where is he?

775
01:26:04,308 --> 01:26:06,476
Pollard?

776
01:26:06,844 --> 01:26:10,552
Mr. Lawrence, wake up.

777
01:26:10,716 --> 01:26:13,092
Where other boats go?

778
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:16,632
- Pollard!
- Kapten Pollard.

779
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:20,384
- Kapten Pollard!
- Pollard!

780
01:26:20,552 --> 01:26:23,260
Captain Pollard!

781
01:26:25,468 --> 01:26:28,300
Pollard!

782
01:26:31,468 --> 01:26:32,760
What is wrong?

783
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:52,676
- Benjamin what are you doing? - Already dead.

784
01:26:52,844 --> 01:26:55,024
I would dump him into the sea.

785
01:26:56,592 --> 01:27:00,968
Look at me, look at me, Benjamin.

786
01:27:04,384 --> 01:27:08,716
No sailor discard dead, that might save them.

787
01:27:19,592 --> 01:27:22,676
Listen to me son, hear me.

788
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:28,008
He can help us.

789
01:27:28,176 --> 01:27:34,132
God our Heavenly Father. In Your Compassion, we want to find entertainment.

790
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:38,716
Patiently waiting for food in days of thy that you pour.

791
01:27:40,052 --> 01:27:42,716
My soul is dead.

792
01:27:55,424 --> 01:27:59,884
Thus, the decision was made.

793
01:28:05,176 --> 01:28:07,752
We prepare the body.

794
01:28:10,132 --> 01:28:12,792
We take his organs.

795
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:18,844
We separate the limbs of his body.

796
01:28:19,008 --> 01:28:22,244
... And cut all the meat from the bones.

797
01:28:26,132 --> 01:28:31,008
Then we shut down his body ...

798
01:28:31,176 --> 01:28:36,260
... And sew together as neatly as possible ...

799
01:28:36,424 --> 01:28:38,924
... And threw it into the sea.

800
01:28:40,716 --> 01:28:43,552
We eat his heart out.

801
01:28:51,092 --> 01:28:52,692
Judge me!

802
01:28:54,884 --> 01:28:56,100
No.

803
01:29:01,968 --> 01:29:04,216
Therefore...

804
01:29:04,384 --> 01:29:08,468
Thus, it has been finished.

805
01:29:10,316 --> 01:29:12,816
The secret is revealed.

806
01:29:13,184 --> 01:29:15,892
Did you ever say to others?

807
01:29:17,852 --> 01:29:19,644
No.

808
01:29:21,016 --> 01:29:22,768
Even your wife?

809
01:29:23,932 --> 01:29:29,100
Is he going to love me, if he knows what I've done?

810
01:29:29,268 --> 01:29:32,184
Yes, he will.

811
01:29:32,852 --> 01:29:36,600
You have to tell me a story, when we first met -

812
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:40,684
Until now I still use the ring from you.

813
01:29:40,852 --> 01:29:47,308
Strong determination that the child remained in you.

814
01:29:47,476 --> 01:29:53,060
I can see it, even if you do not.

815
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:16,808
Now you can continue the full story, dear.

816
01:30:31,516 --> 01:30:33,160
Sit down.

817
01:30:36,144 --> 01:30:37,360
Hear...

818
01:30:38,724 --> 01:30:41,560
Back up your head.

819
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:49,100
We still have a bit of water on the left. Do not give up. We're going home.

820
01:30:54,268 --> 01:30:58,392
Do you have a family at home Mr. Chase?

821
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:01,260
Yes, I have a wife.

822
01:31:03,224 --> 01:31:06,216
And a son or daughter.

823
01:31:19,224 --> 01:31:23,976
71 DAYS STRANDED. MIL 1200 SOUTH WEST.

824
01:31:51,144 --> 01:31:53,100
I do.

825
01:31:54,268 --> 01:31:58,560
- Captain. We pulled again. - Impossible.

826
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:03,144
- We pulled again. - Mr. Ramsdell.

827
01:32:03,308 --> 01:32:06,276
He was later responsible for this boat.

828
01:32:07,644 --> 01:32:11,060
Cousin, you will ...

829
01:32:11,224 --> 01:32:16,184
You are our captain. The crew need you.

830
01:32:16,352 --> 01:32:20,476
- They'll be fine. - I hope ...

831
01:32:20,644 --> 01:32:22,516
I beg of you.

832
01:32:22,684 --> 01:32:25,268
- Henry. - We pulled again.

833
01:32:25,432 --> 01:32:28,476
That's an order.

834
01:32:28,644 --> 01:32:32,684
If you can not, let the others were doing.

835
01:33:00,644 --> 01:33:04,016
No, no, no.

836
01:33:12,224 --> 01:33:13,652
Help me.

837
01:33:17,808 --> 01:33:23,060
For weeks, we found this area over the desert from the sea.

838
01:33:23,424 --> 01:33:26,132
The sun blazed above us.

839
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:28,508
I was scared.

840
01:33:29,676 --> 01:33:32,844
All would think of it.

841
01:33:33,008 --> 01:33:36,760
... All the others are now dead, while I was the last person alive.

842
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:41,376
Mr. Chase judge that we are still 1300 km from the coast.

843
01:33:48,052 --> 01:33:49,484
Mr. Chase.

844
01:33:57,676 --> 01:34:00,384
Captain Pollard.

845
01:34:00,552 --> 01:34:03,468
I'm glad to see you.

846
01:34:03,632 --> 01:34:07,424
There was not much pleased about our survival.

847
01:34:08,592 --> 01:34:11,260
We also Pak.

848
01:34:11,424 --> 01:34:14,216
Barzillai?

849
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:18,132
The third boat?

850
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:20,344
...

851
01:34:20,508 --> 01:34:23,468
They have been gone for days.

852
01:34:23,632 --> 01:34:26,300
I am afraid, they have disappeared.

853
01:34:54,884 --> 01:34:57,092
Mr. Chase, he was in the best position.

854
01:35:13,716 --> 01:35:15,716
It's just a whale.

855
01:35:19,424 --> 01:35:23,008
That's him, throwing his spear. Throw it!

856
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:31,632
- Throw the spear! - Come on.

857
01:35:41,552 --> 01:35:45,508
- Throw! - Come on.

858
01:35:53,260 --> 01:35:57,300
Kill! He was there! Throw a spear!

859
01:36:15,508 --> 01:36:17,716
Why did not you kill him?

860
01:36:43,376 --> 01:36:45,200
You stupid bastard!

861
01:37:09,584 --> 01:37:13,044
Wavelength separating us from one another.

862
01:37:13,208 --> 01:37:17,000
It's the latter, we see Captain Pollard on the boat.

863
01:37:17,168 --> 01:37:19,168
87 DAYS STRANDED.

864
01:37:19,332 --> 01:37:25,044
- There is a boat! - To the harbor.

865
01:37:49,332 --> 01:37:52,044
May God pity.

866
01:38:04,044 --> 01:38:08,708
90 DAYS STRANDED On February 18, 1821.

867
01:38:33,252 --> 01:38:35,708
Mr. Chase.

868
01:38:37,292 --> 01:38:40,876
Father.

869
01:38:42,124 --> 01:38:45,832
Do not leave me Dad.

870
01:39:33,708 --> 01:39:36,708
Mr. Chase.

871
01:39:36,876 --> 01:39:41,292
Mr. Chase, Pak.

872
01:39:44,792 --> 01:39:48,668
Mr. Chase, look!

873
01:39:48,832 --> 01:39:54,208
Wake up, Mr. Chase. Build.

874
01:39:54,376 --> 01:40:00,168
Wake up! No land in sight. Mr. Chase, look!

875
01:40:19,348 --> 01:40:25,056
Kami diselamatkan di Pulau More Outside, Chili ...

876
01:40:25,224 --> 01:40:29,308
After 90 days Essex sank.

877
01:40:29,476 --> 01:40:34,432
They gave us clothes. Also a bit of food.

878
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:39,392
Our early beginning is difficult to eat. Strange.

879
01:40:39,556 --> 01:40:44,976
They took care of us until we found a ship that could take us home.

880
01:40:45,140 --> 01:40:47,768
3-month journey taken.

881
01:40:47,932 --> 01:40:51,808
NANTUCKET PORT On June 11, 1821.

882
01:40:57,016 --> 01:41:01,268
All the islanders came out to greet us.

883
01:41:01,432 --> 01:41:07,184
But there was no cheering. Just be quiet.

884
01:41:07,348 --> 01:41:11,684
They looked at us, as if we were some kind of ...

885
01:41:11,848 --> 01:41:13,976
Ghost...

886
01:41:14,140 --> 01:41:18,308
They have been informed about how we survive life

887
01:41:18,476 --> 01:41:23,268
- But I doubt if they know we will abomination.

888
01:41:23,432 --> 01:41:25,756
Maybe they just want to know.

889
01:42:04,392 --> 01:42:06,976
Oh, God.

890
01:42:13,140 --> 01:42:16,684
I promised you.

891
01:42:23,184 --> 01:42:25,640
Oh, God.

892
01:42:25,808 --> 01:42:30,268
Hello. Hello dear. Who is this?

893
01:42:31,268 --> 01:42:34,432
Phoebe Ann.

894
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:40,176
Phoebe Ann Chase, ya?

895
01:42:40,340 --> 01:42:43,132
He is the father.

896
01:42:43,300 --> 01:42:46,468
Hai manis ...

897
01:42:50,256 --> 01:42:53,256
It's your father.

898
01:42:59,424 --> 01:43:01,508
Oh, God.

899
01:43:09,048 --> 01:43:11,968
The ship owner did not let him in peace.

900
01:43:12,132 --> 01:43:18,340
Mr. Chase was on his way home when he was called back to the shipping office.

901
01:43:19,384 --> 01:43:22,168
On a business to be discussed and fewer questions,

902
01:43:35,968 --> 01:43:38,048
Let's get to business.

903
01:43:41,300 --> 01:43:45,884
Because a lot of lost crew and equipment -

904
01:43:46,048 --> 01:43:48,468
- The investigation remains to be done.

905
01:43:48,632 --> 01:43:53,924
The captain and mate are expected to provide an explanation of what happened.

906
01:43:54,092 --> 01:43:55,592
Yes, of course.

907
01:43:56,256 --> 01:44:01,008
After discussing with the ship owner and father.

908
01:44:01,176 --> 01:44:05,256
... It is clear that the truth would have consequences.

909
01:44:05,424 --> 01:44:08,340
Serious consequences on fisheries whales.

910
01:44:08,508 --> 01:44:11,716
Whale that destroyed the ship Essex.

911
01:44:12,756 --> 01:44:14,532
Indeed it is.

912
01:44:21,968 --> 01:44:26,216
If investors suddenly became worried, how ..

913
01:44:26,384 --> 01:44:29,216
... About Sea Monster that destroyed the boat ...

914
01:44:29,384 --> 01:44:32,384
... And the sailors, although there is survive ...?

915
01:44:32,748 --> 01:44:36,456
We're in the oil business. We all.

916
01:44:37,624 --> 01:44:44,124
And the probability of success must always outweigh the potential risks.

917
01:44:44,292 --> 01:44:47,416
Then what would you say, George?

918
01:44:47,584 --> 01:44:51,792
- Say shipwrecked. - That's a lie.

919
01:44:51,956 --> 01:44:55,168
- And the crew drowned. - Another lie.

920
01:44:55,332 --> 01:44:58,916
- They will have appointed captain. - With pleasure I will write it.

921
01:44:59,084 --> 01:45:03,792
Only if you come back to take fish oil Pope.

922
01:45:03,956 --> 01:45:08,376
- In this way we guarantee. - You're going to be rich.

923
01:45:08,540 --> 01:45:12,916
Chase will be established family name -

924
01:45:13,084 --> 01:45:17,040
- Who would not hear any of Nantucket's elite.

925
01:45:17,208 --> 01:45:19,624
Should I lie for financial gain?

926
01:45:19,792 --> 01:45:24,000
Instead, it is merely a question of grammar.

927
01:45:38,708 --> 01:45:41,540
Essex was rammed by white whales.

928
01:45:41,708 --> 01:45:45,500
All the survivors were at the boat with poor equipment -

929
01:45:45,668 --> 01:45:48,624
- And to do abomination to survive.

930
01:45:48,792 --> 01:45:53,176
And now after coming back we are expected to lie -

931
01:45:54,540 --> 01:46:01,376
Are you guys got more money and sleep soundly at night?

932
01:46:01,540 --> 01:46:04,832
I will not embellish the truth.

933
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,108
And so do you, George?

934
01:46:25,956 --> 01:46:28,000
I saw her last ...

935
01:46:28,168 --> 01:46:29,584
Mr. Chase!

936
01:46:30,748 --> 01:46:34,708
... I'm having trouble finding the right words.

937
01:46:34,876 --> 01:46:35,940
Thomas.

938
01:46:37,208 --> 01:46:40,256
The right word may not exist.

939
01:46:41,124 --> 01:46:45,500
I will be traveling to Falmouth and ...

940
01:46:47,456 --> 01:46:48,484
Is...

941
01:46:49,748 --> 01:46:54,456
... An honor sir, that can sail with you sir.

942
01:46:57,208 --> 01:46:59,748
I am the honorable Mr. Nickerson.

943
01:47:16,832 --> 01:47:17,832
This...

944
01:47:23,248 --> 01:47:25,268
Good luck Captain Thomas.

945
01:47:25,832 --> 01:47:27,776
And you too sir.

946
01:47:56,916 --> 01:48:01,448
The next day, George Pollard trial to provide testimony.

947
01:48:04,292 --> 01:48:06,316
Welcome Captain George Pollard.

948
01:48:07,584 --> 01:48:10,956
All elite Nantucket present there.

949
01:48:11,124 --> 01:48:13,476
It was just a formality.

950
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:18,416
Good afternoon captain, please sit down.

951
01:48:21,456 --> 01:48:24,000
Ready to record ...

952
01:48:25,708 --> 01:48:31,000
Essex ship was hit by a white pope at 12100km western Ecuador.

953
01:48:31,168 --> 01:48:35,208
As if Owen Chase himself speaking.

954
01:48:35,876 --> 01:48:37,916
He's telling the truth.

955
01:48:41,500 --> 01:48:45,208
Captain Pollard seems clear conscience.

956
01:48:45,376 --> 01:48:48,376
But the statement is false.

957
01:48:48,740 --> 01:48:50,768
Pollard sailing again ...

958
01:48:53,032 --> 01:48:55,740
... In the hunt white whales.

959
01:48:55,908 --> 01:48:57,948
He never found it.

960
01:48:59,116 --> 01:49:02,700
His ship ran aground next to Hawaii.

961
01:49:02,868 --> 01:49:04,700
Another curse.

962
01:49:05,868 --> 01:49:09,824
- He never sail again. - And Owen Chase?

963
01:49:10,492 --> 01:49:16,576
He kept his promise. He sent the boat back to Ducie Island.

964
01:49:16,740 --> 01:49:18,740
Mr. Joy died.

965
01:49:18,908 --> 01:49:22,956
But the other three, miraculously still alive.

966
01:49:25,156 --> 01:49:26,948
And then?

967
01:49:27,116 --> 01:49:31,284
He and his family then moved to New Bedford.

968
01:49:32,740 --> 01:49:35,032
He started again.

969
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:40,700
He became captain of Commerce and the ship has its own ship.

970
01:49:48,868 --> 01:49:52,284
You know, he's got something to make money, Mr. Melville.

971
01:49:52,448 --> 01:49:54,948
Tonight is the longest in February.

972
01:49:55,116 --> 01:49:58,576
- The good you just rest now. - Trust me...

973
01:49:58,740 --> 01:50:01,156
I was never a long break.

974
01:50:01,324 --> 01:50:06,132
Why? Because this story?

975
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:08,948
What is the storyline has you writing anything?

976
01:50:09,116 --> 01:50:15,076
- Maybe I did not write the plot. - No? So what?

977
01:50:15,240 --> 01:50:19,700
- Something else you've given me tonight. - What's that?

978
01:50:19,868 --> 01:50:25,368
The courage to go out, where you do not want to go out.

979
01:50:25,532 --> 01:50:26,924
Mr. Melville ...

980
01:50:28,492 --> 01:50:32,892
What have you heard, and what I have said to you ...

981
01:50:33,656 --> 01:50:39,284
... All of this will be found in your novel?

982
01:50:39,448 --> 01:50:43,868
It will be a work of fiction, Mr. Nickerson.

983
01:50:44,032 --> 01:50:47,032
... Which was inspired by the truth ...

984
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:51,240
But perhaps, believe me I would not write it all.

985
01:50:59,368 --> 01:51:00,408
thanks.

986
01:51:01,076 --> 01:51:05,576
- Here take it anymore money. - No, this money to you as I told you.

987
01:51:05,740 --> 01:51:08,240
No, you just save it.

988
01:51:08,408 --> 01:51:13,032
Let me just that store as kompesasi the completion of the story.

989
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:25,532
- So back to ... - Pittsfield Massachusetts.

990
01:51:25,700 --> 01:51:31,616
- Good luck. - Thank you.

991
01:51:34,240 --> 01:51:35,624
Do you know...

992
01:51:36,492 --> 01:51:40,492
I heard there was a man from Pennsylvania reported making a hole in the ground ...

993
01:51:40,656 --> 01:51:44,368
... And find oil. I do not believe.

994
01:51:44,532 --> 01:51:48,532
I also heard.

995
01:51:48,700 --> 01:51:51,200
Oil from the ground ...

996
01:51:52,740 --> 01:51:55,616
Unimaginable.

997
01:52:26,284 --> 01:52:33,740
Herman Melville completed the novel in 1850.

998
01:52:36,700 --> 01:52:44,324
The year after, 'Moby Dick' was released.

999
01:52:46,492 --> 01:52:51,156
Nathaniel Hawthorne said: "A work that is worth reading."

1000
01:52:51,224 --> 01:52:54,184
"This will be one of the greatest novels in America."

1001
01:52:54,384 --> 01:53:03,984
