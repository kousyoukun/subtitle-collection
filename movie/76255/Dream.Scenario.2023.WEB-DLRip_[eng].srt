1
00:01:38,968 --> 00:01:41,144
Dad, Dad.

2
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,061
It's okay, sweetie.

3
00:01:48,978 --> 00:01:52,416
Dad, Dad. Dad, help me!

4
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:54,157
Dad, please help me!

5
00:01:54,157 --> 00:01:55,854
Please help me, please!

6
00:01:56,812 --> 00:02:00,903
<i>And, um, I guess...</i>

7
00:02:00,903 --> 00:02:03,035
Yeah, and then I woke up.

8
00:02:03,035 --> 00:02:05,299
Why didn't I do anything?

9
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:06,474
I don't know.

10
00:02:06,474 --> 00:02:08,824
It's like the third time now.

11
00:02:09,607 --> 00:02:13,698
Why am I always just
standing there?

12
00:02:13,698 --> 00:02:16,658
Don't make her feel guilty
about her dreams, Paul.

13
00:02:17,702 --> 00:02:19,313
You don't see me
that way, right?

14
00:02:19,313 --> 00:02:22,011
That's not how you think
I'd react in real life.

15
00:02:22,011 --> 00:02:23,708
If I was floating?

16
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,580
Do you remember that time
you almost drowned?

17
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,277
How fast I reacted.

18
00:02:27,277 --> 00:02:28,626
She was four.

19
00:02:28,626 --> 00:02:30,280
I remember you
telling me about it.

20
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,413
Bye.
Hannah!

21
00:02:32,413 --> 00:02:34,458
Remember you have to
stay home with Sophie tonight.

22
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:35,677
No, that's tomorrow night.

23
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:38,680
No, the play is tonight.
It was always tonight.

24
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,248
Really, she can't be alone
for, like, a few hours?

25
00:02:41,248 --> 00:02:42,336
I don't mind.

26
00:02:42,336 --> 00:02:43,772
You already
agreed to this.

27
00:02:44,468 --> 00:02:45,687
Okay, fine. Bye.

28
00:02:47,645 --> 00:02:49,386
So, should I just meet
you there, or...

29
00:02:49,386 --> 00:02:50,866
Yeah, probably.

30
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:53,085
I'm not sure how long
it'll take with Sheila, so...

31
00:02:53,085 --> 00:02:55,175
- Are you nervous?
- No, not really.

32
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,785
I... I think it'll be good.

33
00:02:56,785 --> 00:02:58,003
I think she'll understand,

34
00:02:58,003 --> 00:03:01,224
hopefully apologize
and that'll be that.

35
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:02,791
Can you record it?

36
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,184
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

37
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,968
Just the audio
on your phone.

38
00:03:05,968 --> 00:03:07,361
I want to hear
how she reacts.

39
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:09,580
Oh, wow.

40
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,800
So vindictive, Janet.

41
00:03:13,018 --> 00:03:15,282
Yeah, I'll think about it.

42
00:03:15,282 --> 00:03:16,718
But you should go,
you're gonna be late.

43
00:03:16,718 --> 00:03:17,893
No, I'll be fine.

44
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:21,331
- Have a good one.
You, too.

45
00:03:22,593 --> 00:03:26,293
<i>So, when talking about
adaptive strategies,</i>

46
00:03:26,728 --> 00:03:29,209
why does the zebra look
the way it does?

47
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,820
You can spot it miles away,

48
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,039
so it's not
very functional, right?

49
00:03:34,692 --> 00:03:37,608
Any theory on how
the black and white stripes

50
00:03:37,608 --> 00:03:38,914
could be a benefit?

51
00:03:41,656 --> 00:03:42,787
No one?

52
00:03:46,704 --> 00:03:49,316
From what we know,
the camouflage isn't effective

53
00:03:49,316 --> 00:03:51,883
in terms of blending in
with the environment.

54
00:03:51,883 --> 00:03:54,451
Rather, it's about
blending in with the herd.

55
00:03:54,451 --> 00:03:57,019
You see, predators need
to identify their prey.

56
00:03:57,019 --> 00:03:58,760
They can't just attack
the whole group.

57
00:03:59,935 --> 00:04:01,284
So, if you stick your head out,

58
00:04:01,284 --> 00:04:02,764
you make yourself a target.

59
00:04:02,764 --> 00:04:05,157
Yeah.
- Does that make sense?

60
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:09,423
Hi. Hey, focus.

61
00:04:09,423 --> 00:04:11,686
- Is this how it went?
- No, it's different now.

62
00:04:11,686 --> 00:04:14,123
Do you want to share
your discussion with the class?

63
00:04:14,123 --> 00:04:15,559
Sorry. No.

64
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:17,344
Okay, because you just made
yourselves a target

65
00:04:17,344 --> 00:04:18,780
by speaking when
you weren't supposed to.

66
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,303
You get the analogy?

67
00:04:20,303 --> 00:04:21,435
I get the analogy.

68
00:04:21,435 --> 00:04:23,654
Okay, good.
So, in contrast,

69
00:04:23,654 --> 00:04:27,658
can anyone think of instances
where sticking out

70
00:04:27,658 --> 00:04:30,400
can be an evolutionary benefit?

71
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,445
- Yes.
- Uh, mating?

72
00:04:31,445 --> 00:04:32,620
Mating.

73
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,274
Welcome to Madre.

74
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,277
Hi, I have a table, for Paul.

75
00:04:41,237 --> 00:04:42,717
What?

76
00:04:42,717 --> 00:04:44,414
I'm sorry,
don't I know you?

77
00:04:44,414 --> 00:04:45,720
I don't know, do you?

78
00:04:46,895 --> 00:04:48,592
Yeah, I...

79
00:04:48,592 --> 00:04:51,247
Well, Osler, maybe. I'm...
I'm a professor there.

80
00:04:51,247 --> 00:04:53,293
No.
No, I didn't go there.

81
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,556
- Have you been with us lately?
- No.

82
00:04:55,556 --> 00:04:59,429
Yeah. Okay, uh, sorry.
I'm just...

83
00:04:59,429 --> 00:05:03,041
some major deja vu or...

84
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,087
- Brian, right?
- Paul.

85
00:05:26,543 --> 00:05:28,676
Hi, Paul.

86
00:05:28,676 --> 00:05:30,373
Oh, it's so nice to see you.

87
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:32,375
Yeah, it's been
too long, Sheila.

88
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,725
I barely recognized you. Wow.

89
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:36,553
Oh, yeah?
The beard maybe?

90
00:05:36,553 --> 00:05:40,078
No, it's the whole,
you know...

91
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:46,955
So, how long are you
in town for?

92
00:05:46,955 --> 00:05:49,740
Just a few days,
visiting my brother.

93
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,307
How's everything with you?

94
00:05:51,307 --> 00:05:54,354
- You're still at Osler, right?
- Yeah, I am.

95
00:05:58,183 --> 00:06:00,403
And you're publishing
another paper, I heard.

96
00:06:00,403 --> 00:06:04,189
Oh, yeah, uh,
we're just doing
final revisions now.

97
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:05,452
So, it's... it's looking good.

98
00:06:05,452 --> 00:06:07,976
Where'd you end up?
Which publication?

99
00:06:07,976 --> 00:06:10,587
Uh, do you want to...
Should we look at the menu?

100
00:06:10,587 --> 00:06:12,807
Yeah.
Which publication, though?

101
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:14,722
Uh, <i>Nature.</i>

102
00:06:14,722 --> 00:06:16,288
<i>Nature?</i>

103
00:06:16,288 --> 00:06:17,768
Yeah. We're happy about that.

104
00:06:17,768 --> 00:06:19,988
I mean, it's been
a while, so, yeah.

105
00:06:31,869 --> 00:06:33,697
<i>Why haven't
you contacted me?</i>

106
00:06:33,697 --> 00:06:35,525
<i>What?</i>
<i>Why am I not
being credited?</i>

107
00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:36,874
<i>What do you mean?</i>

108
00:06:36,874 --> 00:06:39,311
<i>Oh, come on,
swarm intelligence?</i>

109
00:06:39,311 --> 00:06:41,183
<i>Ant colony algorithms?</i>

110
00:06:41,183 --> 00:06:42,445
Yeah.

111
00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:44,534
Sounds awfully similar
to my research now.

112
00:06:44,534 --> 00:06:47,494
Well, I... Do you mean
from grad school?

113
00:06:47,494 --> 00:06:49,104
Yes. You weren't
even interested

114
00:06:49,104 --> 00:06:50,322
in networks back then.

115
00:06:50,322 --> 00:06:52,455
You were all about
senescence.

116
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:55,066
Yes, I... I... I mean,
I've expanded my interests

117
00:06:55,066 --> 00:06:57,068
over the last 30 years.

118
00:06:57,068 --> 00:07:00,550
Are you using
"antelligence"? You know
I coined that, right?

119
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,857
I'm not using
"antelligence."

120
00:07:02,857 --> 00:07:05,860
Look, there's a big difference
between talking about an idea

121
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,818
and actually
doing all the work.

122
00:07:07,818 --> 00:07:10,952
No, no, I've been working.
I've got a book.

123
00:07:10,952 --> 00:07:14,477
Uh, do you have
a publisher?

124
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:17,437
Well, I... I want to finish it
before I take it out.

125
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,090
I don't want
to be influenced by

126
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,744
any sort of corporate agenda.

127
00:07:20,744 --> 00:07:22,877
- Can I read a draft, or...
- Oh, why?

128
00:07:22,877 --> 00:07:25,749
- Do you need more material?
- Oh, come on, Paul.

129
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:27,490
Let's be adults here.

130
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,579
How far along are you?

131
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:32,452
Well, I haven't really started
the actual sitting down

132
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,889
and writing portion
of it yet, but...

133
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:37,369
<i>So, this kind of ruins
everything for me, Sheila.</i>

134
00:07:37,369 --> 00:07:39,850
<i>It's just a complete
appropriation. I mean...</i>

135
00:07:40,982 --> 00:07:43,419
Can you at least
just credit me?

136
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:46,161
There's nothing
wrong with just being
a professor, Paul.

137
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:47,728
You don't need to be
a researcher, too.

138
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,515
<i>Please, Sheila. I need this.</i>

139
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,630
Paul.
- Jan.

140
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,197
- Hi.
You got the tickets?

141
00:08:22,197 --> 00:08:24,025
Yeah. How'd it go?

142
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:25,548
What, oh,
you mean with Sheila?

143
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:26,854
Yeah.

144
00:08:26,854 --> 00:08:28,116
Yeah. Well, yeah,
you know, it's technical.

145
00:08:28,116 --> 00:08:29,726
I mean, she totally
saw my argument,

146
00:08:29,726 --> 00:08:32,033
but we didn't fully,
you know, resolve it yet.

147
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:34,514
Really? So, what's next?

148
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,689
I'll figure it out.

149
00:08:35,689 --> 00:08:37,473
Okay. Well, was she defensive?

150
00:08:37,473 --> 00:08:40,041
- Did you record it?
- No, no.

151
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:44,524
It kind of felt, you know,
unethical or whatever.

152
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,526
- You want to go inside?
- Yeah.

153
00:09:07,155 --> 00:09:09,549
Paul. Paul!

154
00:09:10,506 --> 00:09:12,943
Ah!
I thought that was you.

155
00:09:12,943 --> 00:09:14,466
- Claire?
- Yeah.

156
00:09:14,466 --> 00:09:16,294
Hi, my God.

157
00:09:16,294 --> 00:09:18,166
Oh, it's so good
to see you.

158
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,776
You just saw the play?

159
00:09:19,776 --> 00:09:21,778
Duh, yeah. Of course.

160
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:24,172
- This is my wife, Janet.
- Oh, hi.

161
00:09:24,172 --> 00:09:25,956
- Hi.
- I'm Claire.

162
00:09:25,956 --> 00:09:27,697
- Hello, Janet.
- When did you get married?

163
00:09:27,697 --> 00:09:30,700
Oh, wow. That's about,
well, let's see...

164
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,181
- 15 years.
- Yeah, 15 years ago.

165
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:35,183
I'm so glad I ran into you.

166
00:09:35,183 --> 00:09:36,924
You've been on my mind
a lot lately.

167
00:09:36,924 --> 00:09:38,839
I'm sorry. How do you
two know each other?

168
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:41,668
Oh, well,
Claire and I used to date.

169
00:09:41,668 --> 00:09:43,278
Yeah.

170
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:45,280
- Wild right?

171
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,587
Anyway, you've been on
my mind recently.

172
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:51,765
Yeah? I, uh...
I haven't thought
about you in a while.

173
00:09:51,765 --> 00:09:55,377
Okay. Good to know, I guess.

174
00:09:55,377 --> 00:09:57,379
Anyway, the reason that
you've been on my mind

175
00:09:57,379 --> 00:09:59,381
is because you keep
popping up in my dreams.

176
00:09:59,947 --> 00:10:01,513
- Really?
Yeah.

177
00:10:01,513 --> 00:10:02,993
Like, a lot
in the last few weeks.

178
00:10:03,777 --> 00:10:05,082
It's so strange.

179
00:10:05,082 --> 00:10:06,910
You don't do anything.
You're just there,

180
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,609
even if the dream's
completely unrelated to you.

181
00:10:10,131 --> 00:10:11,393
Like the other night,

182
00:10:11,393 --> 00:10:14,048
a good friend of mine
was lying in the street,

183
00:10:14,048 --> 00:10:17,486
<i>hit by a car, bleeding,
dying in my arms, right?</i>

184
00:10:17,486 --> 00:10:19,793
And then... this is just
in the dream, of course.

185
00:10:19,793 --> 00:10:22,143
<i>And out of nowhere,</i>

186
00:10:22,143 --> 00:10:25,102
<i>there you are,
just strolling by.</i>

187
00:10:28,236 --> 00:10:31,892
Wow. I'm... Well, I mean,
that is so strange.

188
00:10:31,892 --> 00:10:35,112
So, I don't intervene at all?
I... I don't help out?

189
00:10:35,112 --> 00:10:36,940
You're still doing that?

190
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,247
- What?
Searching
for the insult.

191
00:10:39,943 --> 00:10:42,380
No, you don't do anything,
but it's not like I blame you.

192
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,731
I was just gonna say
that my therapist

193
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:46,123
suggested that I reach out.

194
00:10:46,123 --> 00:10:51,128
That maybe you and I
need to sort something out,

195
00:10:51,128 --> 00:10:52,564
you know, subconsciously.

196
00:10:52,564 --> 00:10:55,567
Did... did you know
he was here?

197
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:58,440
No, no, no, I just happened
to see you guys,

198
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,529
which feels like a sign,
you know, synchronicity.

199
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:03,010
Okay. Okay. Yeah.

200
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,925
Do you think we can grab
a coffee or something?

201
00:11:04,925 --> 00:11:06,883
You know,
just catch up and stuff?

202
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:09,886
Yeah, we... we can do that.
Sure, why not?

203
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:11,671
I mean, you know...

204
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,585
Should I take
your number?

205
00:11:13,585 --> 00:11:14,674
Oh, uh...

206
00:11:15,849 --> 00:11:17,502
- Okay, yeah.
Okay.

207
00:11:17,502 --> 00:11:19,722
Put your number in there.

208
00:11:21,071 --> 00:11:23,944
- Did you like the play?
- I did, yeah. Yeah.

209
00:11:27,469 --> 00:11:28,905
What, you changed
your last name?

210
00:11:28,905 --> 00:11:31,125
Yeah, I took hers.
We thought it was...

211
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:34,911
I thought it was appropriate.
I wanted to.

212
00:11:34,911 --> 00:11:36,173
Right.

213
00:11:36,173 --> 00:11:37,740
Why'd you get all red?

214
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,221
Well, I was just taken aback
by the whole situation.

215
00:11:40,221 --> 00:11:42,136
Wouldn't you react the same

216
00:11:42,136 --> 00:11:45,095
if some old boyfriend
just cornered you like that?

217
00:11:45,095 --> 00:11:47,184
I don't think I'd turn
into a stuttering fool.

218
00:11:47,184 --> 00:11:48,838
I don't think
I was stuttering.

219
00:11:48,838 --> 00:11:50,448
She seemed
really happy to see you.

220
00:11:50,448 --> 00:11:53,669
Well, yeah, but not becau...
It's because of these dreams.

221
00:11:53,669 --> 00:11:55,366
Why are you
defending her?

222
00:11:55,366 --> 00:11:58,195
Are you just
trying to pick a fight
with me right now?

223
00:11:58,195 --> 00:12:00,981
No, I'm just nervous
what this woman will do to you

224
00:12:00,981 --> 00:12:03,635
- when I'm not there.
- Do to me?

225
00:12:03,635 --> 00:12:05,202
What's she gonna do to me?

226
00:12:07,204 --> 00:12:08,466
Jump me?

227
00:12:08,466 --> 00:12:11,208
Why did you ask if
she was married?

228
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:14,690
I was
making conversation.

229
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:17,693
Okay. Well, maybe
I'm exaggerating a little bit,

230
00:12:17,693 --> 00:12:20,652
but I would be lying if I said
I wasn't worried at all.

231
00:12:20,652 --> 00:12:22,045
That's fair.

232
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,006
But I'm just meeting her
for coffee, that's it.

233
00:12:27,224 --> 00:12:28,530
I love you.

234
00:12:30,445 --> 00:12:33,491
Have you ever fantasized
about other women?

235
00:12:36,843 --> 00:12:38,975
Yeah, of course, I have.

236
00:12:38,975 --> 00:12:41,195
But never cheated?
- Oh, my God, Janet.

237
00:12:41,195 --> 00:12:42,674
Do you really think
I'm that cool?

238
00:12:42,674 --> 00:12:44,024
Do you think I could handle

239
00:12:44,024 --> 00:12:46,548
the emotional burden
of having an affair?

240
00:12:46,548 --> 00:12:49,029
- No. No, you're right.

241
00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:52,032
Just try not to let
your neuroticism hijack you.

242
00:12:52,032 --> 00:12:55,426
Oh, come on. Not the gender
psychology bullshit again.

243
00:12:55,426 --> 00:12:57,820
We both know you score high
in neuroticism.

244
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,170
It's best to just own it
and be pragmatic about it.

245
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:05,262
Yeah. Well, you score high in,
uh, in... "assholeness."

246
00:13:06,263 --> 00:13:08,222
I... I score high in
"assholeness"?

247
00:13:08,222 --> 00:13:11,703
Yeah. So, just own it.
Be pragmatic about it.

248
00:13:15,098 --> 00:13:16,491
How about this?

249
00:13:16,491 --> 00:13:19,276
I'll keep it very formal
when I meet her.

250
00:13:19,711 --> 00:13:21,148
I won't even smile.

251
00:13:22,323 --> 00:13:24,412
- She might like that.
-  What?

252
00:13:24,412 --> 00:13:25,761
- She might like that.
- Oh, no.

253
00:13:25,761 --> 00:13:27,241
Yeah, it's just so...

254
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:29,069
Well, it's just
so intense, you know?

255
00:13:29,069 --> 00:13:31,201
And I usually don't even
remember my dreams.

256
00:13:31,201 --> 00:13:34,814
Wow. I... I feel like
I want to apologize

257
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,599
for barging into
your head like that.

258
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:40,863
No, it's okay.
It's just funny, you know?

259
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:42,909
Anyway, thanks
for meeting me.

260
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:44,258
Of course.

261
00:13:44,258 --> 00:13:46,564
Um, there's actually, um...

262
00:13:46,564 --> 00:13:47,827
there's something
I want to ask you.

263
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,480
- Oh, yeah?
Mm-hmm.

264
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,960
What?

265
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,832
Would it be okay
if I wrote about this?

266
00:13:53,702 --> 00:13:55,660
What do you mean?
In... in what way?

267
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,098
Well, I write for this magazine
called The New Inquiry.

268
00:13:58,098 --> 00:14:00,317
Really? You're publishing?

269
00:14:00,317 --> 00:14:01,710
It's just online.

270
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:04,756
It's more like a blog.
Nobody really reads it.

271
00:14:04,756 --> 00:14:07,107
What... what sort of
stuff do you write about?

272
00:14:07,107 --> 00:14:09,457
Mostly psychology.
Jungian stuff.

273
00:14:09,457 --> 00:14:10,632
- Oh.
Yeah, okay.

274
00:14:10,632 --> 00:14:11,981
I knew you'd scoff at that.

275
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:13,896
Sorry,
I didn't mean to.

276
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:16,072
What, you want
to write about me?

277
00:14:16,072 --> 00:14:18,379
No, I want to write
about the dreams.

278
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:20,685
About randomly
seeing you, just that.

279
00:14:20,685 --> 00:14:23,166
It's just... it's just very
on brand from what I do.

280
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,821
I mean, yeah,
if you don't portray me

281
00:14:25,821 --> 00:14:29,477
as this inadequate loser,
like in your dreams.

282
00:14:29,477 --> 00:14:30,957
You're
seriously insulted.

283
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:33,916
No, of course not.
I'm joking.

284
00:14:34,482 --> 00:14:35,613
So, you'd be okay
with it?

285
00:14:35,613 --> 00:14:38,268
- Yes. Yeah. Go ahead.
- Yes.

286
00:14:38,268 --> 00:14:39,835
Thank you. Yes.

287
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,364
- What?
No, it's...

288
00:14:47,364 --> 00:14:52,413
just my wife suspected
you had ulterior motives.

289
00:14:52,413 --> 00:14:53,980
Like what?

290
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,722
Well, that you still
had feelings for me,

291
00:14:57,722 --> 00:14:59,811
that you missed me.

292
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:01,944
Wait... really?

293
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:04,512
That's so funny.
Why would she say that?

294
00:15:04,512 --> 00:15:07,558
Oh, I... I mean,
I don't know, I...

295
00:15:07,558 --> 00:15:10,300
Oh, shoot, I have to run.

296
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,999
Um, well, thank you.

297
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:15,436
- Thanks for doing this, really.
- Sure.

298
00:15:16,785 --> 00:15:20,397
I guess I'll, uh... I guess
I'll see you in my dreams.

299
00:15:20,397 --> 00:15:23,531
Yeah, of course not.

300
00:15:24,227 --> 00:15:25,402
Thanks.

301
00:15:29,754 --> 00:15:31,147
Is it him?

302
00:15:31,147 --> 00:15:33,106
It's Paul for sure.
That's so weird.

303
00:15:33,106 --> 00:15:34,759
We're basically
having the same dream.

304
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:36,544
I know, it's so
random. It's just, like,

305
00:15:36,544 --> 00:15:39,155
Paul, every night
for some reason.

306
00:15:39,155 --> 00:15:41,027
Hi.
- Hey.

307
00:15:41,027 --> 00:15:42,376
You guys good?

308
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:43,899
Yeah. You?
- Yeah.

309
00:15:48,556 --> 00:15:49,992
So amazing.

310
00:15:58,914 --> 00:16:00,046
What?

311
00:16:00,046 --> 00:16:01,438
Have you been
dreaming about me?

312
00:16:01,438 --> 00:16:03,136
Have I been
dreaming about you?

313
00:16:03,136 --> 00:16:04,398
Yeah.

314
00:16:05,138 --> 00:16:06,661
Ever in my life, you mean?

315
00:16:06,661 --> 00:16:08,837
No, recently.

316
00:16:08,837 --> 00:16:11,361
I don't know. I don't keep
track of things like that.

317
00:16:13,842 --> 00:16:16,018
You're kind of freaking me out.
What's going on?

318
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,454
Nothing.

319
00:16:20,414 --> 00:16:22,503
Can we please put
our phones away

320
00:16:22,503 --> 00:16:24,244
and have
a real conversation?

321
00:16:26,507 --> 00:16:29,510
So, how was school today,
Sophie?

322
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,383
- Dad.
- It's fine,

323
00:16:33,383 --> 00:16:34,602
I'll call them back later.

324
00:16:34,602 --> 00:16:35,907
Tell me about your day.

325
00:16:35,907 --> 00:16:37,431
Can you turn
the sound off at least?

326
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:38,954
Yes, I'll do that next time.

327
00:16:38,954 --> 00:16:40,216
It'll stop soon.

328
00:16:42,697 --> 00:16:44,307
Sophie, didn't you guys decide

329
00:16:44,307 --> 00:16:46,092
which character
you're going to be

330
00:16:46,092 --> 00:16:47,789
- for the... for the play or...
- Yeah.

331
00:16:50,661 --> 00:16:51,836
Let me just hang up.

332
00:16:54,404 --> 00:16:56,058
I have to take this.

333
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:58,930
- That's not allowed.
- Richard, hi.

334
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:01,063
<i>Is this a good time?
You have a minute?</i>

335
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:03,022
Yeah. What's going on?

336
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,676
<i>So, uh, where do I start?</i>

337
00:17:05,676 --> 00:17:07,461
Oh, wow. It sounds serious.

338
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:09,202
<i>No, it's funny.</i>

339
00:17:09,202 --> 00:17:12,248
<i>You know sometimes I have
these dinner parties, right?</i>

340
00:17:12,248 --> 00:17:14,946
Yeah. Is this finally
the invite?

341
00:17:14,946 --> 00:17:17,688
<i>No, it's, uh...
I just had one.</i>

342
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:20,430
Oh, okay, and?

343
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,085
- So, I've told my husband
this ad nauseam,

344
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:25,392
but it's about
a recurring dream I've had,

345
00:17:25,392 --> 00:17:27,089
or not so much
a specific dream

346
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,178
but a specific person
I keep dreaming about.

347
00:17:29,178 --> 00:17:32,138
He looks perfectly average.

348
00:17:32,138 --> 00:17:35,489
He's a remarkable nobody
that just shows up.

349
00:17:35,489 --> 00:17:39,145
He just occupies the space
like an awkward guest

350
00:17:39,145 --> 00:17:41,364
at a party
that no one really knows.

351
00:17:41,364 --> 00:17:42,496
You mean like Sydney?

352
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:45,194
- Yeah.

353
00:17:45,194 --> 00:17:47,196
No, I mean...

354
00:17:47,196 --> 00:17:50,417
I have also... I've...
I've also had that experience.

355
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:51,983
I already
told Richard about it.

356
00:17:51,983 --> 00:17:54,812
- I did, I told you...
- Yes, and I'm kind of upset,

357
00:17:54,812 --> 00:17:56,292
to tell you the truth.

358
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:58,077
She's dreaming
about another man.

359
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,166
Yeah, very
similar to yours, Naomi.

360
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:03,386
Except in my case,
it's this... this guy
that we sort of know.

361
00:18:03,386 --> 00:18:05,214
This old friend
of Richard's, Paul.

362
00:18:05,214 --> 00:18:08,087
Well, we went to
the same university.

363
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,002
He's actually
not that memorable.

364
00:18:11,002 --> 00:18:12,917
- He's kind of boring.

365
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:15,224
I... I don't get
why you're so into him.

366
00:18:15,224 --> 00:18:16,704
I'm not into him.

367
00:18:16,704 --> 00:18:18,314
So, what does he look like?

368
00:18:18,314 --> 00:18:21,274
Well, he does actually
kind of look like Sydney.

369
00:18:23,276 --> 00:18:24,755
Do you have a picture?

370
00:18:45,994 --> 00:18:47,169
Paul?

371
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:50,781
Oh, my God.

372
00:18:50,781 --> 00:18:52,348
- Paul. Paul!
[ON PHONE] <i>Hello.</i>

373
00:18:52,348 --> 00:18:54,133
Oh, my God.

374
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,525
<i>Are you there?</i>
Hey, what...

375
00:18:55,525 --> 00:18:56,961
what happened?

376
00:18:57,832 --> 00:18:58,920
Hey.

377
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:15,893
Janet! There...
there... there's, like,
100 messages on here.

378
00:19:15,893 --> 00:19:17,765
Probably Claire's article.

379
00:19:17,765 --> 00:19:21,072
She must have linked it
to my profile or something.

380
00:19:21,638 --> 00:19:23,553
Somebody wants
to interview me.

381
00:19:23,553 --> 00:19:25,120
Why are you so excited?

382
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,341
- Why? What's wrong?
- This is strange, Paul.

383
00:19:28,341 --> 00:19:30,821
Maybe you should
take a minute and think

384
00:19:30,821 --> 00:19:32,388
before you do
anything drastic.

385
00:19:38,481 --> 00:19:41,484
Why me?
Uh, I don't know,

386
00:19:41,484 --> 00:19:43,312
I'm special, I guess.

387
00:19:43,312 --> 00:19:46,228
<i>An area man
has found himself

388
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:48,012
<i>a strange dream epidemic,</i>

390

391
00:19:53,888 --> 00:19:58,284

- No, Mom, I don't know.

396
00:20:07,554 --> 00:20:09,643
<i>This is a spiritual
type of dream visitation.</i>

397

this is dubious, of course,</i>

398

- I didn't do anything.

<i>It... it's a very interesting
time in my field...</i>

400
00:20:16,824 --> 00:20:19,043
This is gonna be so weird
to explain at school.

401
00:20:19,043 --> 00:20:21,655
<i>Our online poll
shows thousands of reports
of the phenomenon.</i>

402
00:20:21,655 --> 00:20:25,049
What are you getting
so upset for, Mom? I'm fine.

403
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:27,313
I'm missing
the whole segment now.

Okay. Okay.
Please calm down.

409
00:20:57,865 --> 00:20:58,996
Calm down.

410
00:20:58,996 --> 00:21:00,171
Thank you.

411
00:21:00,607 --> 00:21:02,304
Who's really here for
the lecture on kin selection?

412
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:03,479
Show of hands.

413
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,221
Okay, the rest of you,
I'll give you five minutes

414
00:21:06,221 --> 00:21:07,875
before I start
the lecture, okay?

415
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,224
Ask me anything.

416
00:21:09,224 --> 00:21:10,356
Yes, you?

417
00:21:10,356 --> 00:21:11,661
How does it feel to go viral?

418
00:21:11,661 --> 00:21:12,967
Huh.

419
00:21:13,446 --> 00:21:16,144
Well, we can discuss that
when we get to memetics

420
00:21:16,144 --> 00:21:17,624
later this year.

421
00:21:17,624 --> 00:21:19,756
- Yes, you?
- Why is this happening?

422
00:21:19,756 --> 00:21:21,367
I have no clue.

423
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:23,325
My guess would
be as good as yours.

424
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:26,981
Are you gonna do, like,
Stephen Colbert or anything?

425
00:21:26,981 --> 00:21:28,678
-  Oh, not a chance.

426
00:21:28,678 --> 00:21:31,681
I actually enjoy my anonymity,
if you can believe that.

427
00:21:31,681 --> 00:21:33,596
Okay. You!

428
00:21:33,596 --> 00:21:35,772
I think maybe I had
a dream about you

429
00:21:35,772 --> 00:21:38,253
but it's, like,
super blurry and, like,

430
00:21:38,253 --> 00:21:40,168
I wanna, like,
be better at remembering them.

431
00:21:40,168 --> 00:21:43,432
- And, uh, how do I do that?
- I'm not really an expert here.

432
00:21:43,432 --> 00:21:46,957
Keeping a dream journal
is a common exercise,

433
00:21:46,957 --> 00:21:48,959
but isn't seeing
me in class enough?

434
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:53,312
Who's certain they've
actually had a dream about me?

435
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,271
Okay.
Let's explore this.

436
00:21:56,271 --> 00:21:57,881
This might get us
somewhere interesting.

437
00:21:58,491 --> 00:22:00,928
Does anyone want to share
the content of their dream?

438
00:22:00,928 --> 00:22:03,974
- Yes, you?
- Well, um.

439
00:22:03,974 --> 00:22:05,454
I'm in this forest,

440
00:22:05,454 --> 00:22:08,762
<i>wandering around, eating
these strange mushrooms,</i>

441
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:12,243
<i>and I'm in, like,
a full tuxedo for some reason.</i>

442
00:22:12,983 --> 00:22:15,682
<i>And there's other
people also dressed up,</i>

443
00:22:15,682 --> 00:22:19,990
<i>but they're all scared,
like, frozen in fear.</i>

444
00:22:20,817 --> 00:22:22,776
<i>And then I realize
it's because of this</i>

445
00:22:22,776 --> 00:22:24,865
<i>really tall man
running towards me.</i>

446
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,758
Hide.

447
00:22:50,717 --> 00:22:52,196
Are you talking to me?

448
00:22:52,196 --> 00:22:54,677
Yes, Paul, he'll kill us.

449
00:22:54,677 --> 00:22:55,765
Paul!

450
00:22:55,765 --> 00:22:57,288
I've never seen these.

451
00:22:58,115 --> 00:22:59,290
Beautiful.

452
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:02,511
No! No!

453
00:23:02,511 --> 00:23:05,993
- And that's all I remember.

454
00:23:05,993 --> 00:23:08,038
Ah. Interesting.

455
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:11,694
So, I'm looking
at the mushrooms

456
00:23:11,694 --> 00:23:14,349
- instead of helping?
- Oh, I suppose, yeah.

457
00:23:15,045 --> 00:23:17,396
Okay, let's hear
another one. Anyone?

458
00:23:43,726 --> 00:23:47,164
Okay, so,
I'm just observing again.

459
00:23:47,948 --> 00:23:49,340
But that's funny.

460
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,038
Interesting one.

461
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:52,213
Anyone else?

462
00:23:59,612 --> 00:24:00,700
Huh.

463
00:24:13,103 --> 00:24:15,366
- It ends like that?
- Yeah.

464
00:24:15,366 --> 00:24:17,673
That's, uh,
that's all I can remember.

465
00:24:17,673 --> 00:24:20,763
Does anyone have
a more original one?

466
00:24:20,763 --> 00:24:23,940
Maybe one where
I'm actually doing something.

467
00:24:26,116 --> 00:24:27,291
No one?

468
00:24:28,336 --> 00:24:30,077
Okay, well,
let's just hear them anyway.

469
00:24:30,077 --> 00:24:32,688
- Who's next?

470
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,830
Dad.

471
00:24:44,047 --> 00:24:46,049
Oh, my God, delete that.

472
00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:47,877
No, it's fine.
I'm just sending it to Kyle.

473
00:24:47,877 --> 00:24:49,879
- Who's Kyle?
- Tammy's friend.

474
00:24:49,879 --> 00:24:51,794
He doesn't believe
you're my dad for some reason.

475
00:24:51,794 --> 00:24:54,318
Oh, you guys are flirting?

476
00:24:54,318 --> 00:24:57,452
No, um, he was
just asking about you.

477
00:24:57,452 --> 00:24:59,280
So, I'm finally cool, huh?

478
00:24:59,933 --> 00:25:01,630
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

479
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,805
You hear that, Janet?

480
00:25:02,805 --> 00:25:04,198
She's saying
I'm a cool dad now.

481
00:25:04,198 --> 00:25:06,243
I didn't...
I didn't say that.

482
00:25:06,243 --> 00:25:07,810
Can you drive
me to school today?

483
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:10,204
- You want me to?
Mm-hmm.

484
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:11,814
I guess I can make it.

485
00:25:11,814 --> 00:25:14,295
- Janet, does that work?
- Yeah, take her.

486
00:25:15,601 --> 00:25:18,342
Dude, this is so insane.

487
00:25:18,342 --> 00:25:20,910
Like, how's he
dealing with all this?

488
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:24,131
We're not even the type
of people that like attention,

489
00:25:24,131 --> 00:25:25,349
- you know?
- Right.

490
00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:27,613
So, the whole
thing is so bizarre.

491
00:25:27,613 --> 00:25:29,745
So bizarre.
So bizarre.

492
00:25:29,745 --> 00:25:32,443
My sister is actually, like,

493
00:25:32,443 --> 00:25:34,968
starstruck that I know you,
you know?

494
00:25:34,968 --> 00:25:36,447
She sent me this
article and she's like,

495
00:25:36,447 --> 00:25:37,753
"Check this guy out, Paul."

496
00:25:37,753 --> 00:25:40,713
And I was like,
"Uh, that's Paul Matthews.

497
00:25:40,713 --> 00:25:42,062
"I know his wife."

498
00:25:42,062 --> 00:25:44,368
- That's so funny.
- Yeah. Also, I was listening

499
00:25:44,368 --> 00:25:46,153
to this podcast that I like.

500
00:25:46,153 --> 00:25:47,720
They were talking about Paul.

501
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,373
Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

502
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:52,855
They were relating Paul to,
like, this old internet meme.

503
00:25:52,855 --> 00:25:54,683
And then they were
talking about how, like,

504
00:25:54,683 --> 00:25:56,859
all memes will become dreams

505
00:25:56,859 --> 00:25:58,905
- or something like that.
- Oh, that's interesting.

506
00:25:58,905 --> 00:26:00,080
It is interesting.

507
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,125
How is the museum going,
by the way?

508
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:03,518
- The what?
- The museum.

509
00:26:03,518 --> 00:26:04,693
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

510
00:26:04,693 --> 00:26:06,173
No, it's good. It's good.

511
00:26:06,173 --> 00:26:07,783
I feel like there's
a few challenges for us

512
00:26:07,783 --> 00:26:09,611
to still wrap up,
but overall it's going good.

513
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:10,873
Thanks for asking.

514
00:26:10,873 --> 00:26:12,222
- Great.
- Mm-hmm.

515
00:26:12,222 --> 00:26:14,181
- I know it's not my project...
Mm-hmm.

516
00:26:14,181 --> 00:26:17,184
...but I'd love to
be involved somehow.

517
00:26:17,184 --> 00:26:18,751
Oh, yeah.

518
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:20,187
No, thanks. I mean, I...

519
00:26:20,187 --> 00:26:22,058
I feel like we're
in a pretty good position.

520
00:26:22,058 --> 00:26:23,582
Yeah. You know,

521
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,497
just if you want to bounce
ideas or want some feedback.

522
00:26:27,977 --> 00:26:31,764
Yeah. No. Yeah, I think,
uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

523
00:26:32,199 --> 00:26:35,811
You just want to bounce ideas
back and maybe just... yeah.

524
00:26:35,811 --> 00:26:37,770
I thought
you weren't on that project.

525
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,815
Well, I wasn't,
but now Chris wants me on.

526
00:26:39,815 --> 00:26:41,251
Well, that's great.

527
00:26:41,251 --> 00:26:43,166
- I'm happy for you.
- Thank you.

528
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:45,212
We also got an invite
to one of Richard's famous

529
00:26:45,212 --> 00:26:46,387
dinner parties.

530
00:26:46,387 --> 00:26:49,608
- Really? When?
- On the 5th.

531
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,262
Can you believe it,
after all these years?

532
00:26:53,046 --> 00:26:56,571
I was tempted to say no,
but I think we should go.

533
00:26:57,006 --> 00:26:58,442
- Hey, Paul.
- Yeah?

534
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,881
Why do you suppose you're
not showing up in my dreams?

535
00:27:01,881 --> 00:27:04,231
Well, because
you get the real deal.

536
00:27:04,231 --> 00:27:05,841
It wouldn't
be fair if you got both.

537
00:27:07,364 --> 00:27:10,367
- Are you jealous?
- I don't know. I mean,

538
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:12,674
- rationally, I'm not, but...
- Then maybe I should

539
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:14,023
give you a little visit.

540
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:16,156
What would you want me to do?

541
00:27:16,765 --> 00:27:19,594
What would you want
to see in your dream?

542
00:27:19,594 --> 00:27:24,904
Wow. Um...
I want to see you...

543
00:27:27,123 --> 00:27:28,995
Remember when you wore
that Talking Heads suit

544
00:27:28,995 --> 00:27:30,213
for Halloween?

545
00:27:30,605 --> 00:27:31,780
Yeah.

546
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,477
There was just
something about it.

547
00:27:33,477 --> 00:27:35,349
Something kind
of weird and sexy.

548
00:27:36,002 --> 00:27:38,569
You should
wear that and save me

549
00:27:38,569 --> 00:27:40,571
from, like, some situation.

550
00:27:42,965 --> 00:27:44,706
That's your sexual fantasy?

551
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:46,316
Sky's the limit here

552
00:27:46,316 --> 00:27:49,319
and you sell it for me wearing
a comically large suit.

553
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:52,105
I don't know,
I'm not good under pressure.

554
00:27:52,105 --> 00:27:56,196
Just show up naked,
on a horse, with a huge penis.

555
00:27:56,196 --> 00:27:58,024
- Is that better?
- Who has a huge penis?

556
00:27:58,024 --> 00:27:59,808
- Me or the horse?
- You.

557
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:01,418
I'm doing the David Byrne suit.

558
00:28:01,418 --> 00:28:03,159
- It's been decided.
No, let me think
about it.

559
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:04,378
No, no, no.

560
00:28:04,378 --> 00:28:05,771
You immediately
said the suit and that's

561
00:28:05,771 --> 00:28:06,859
- what you're getting.
- Fine.

562
00:28:09,818 --> 00:28:11,341
Do you think
other people are seeing

563
00:28:11,341 --> 00:28:14,083
you naked in their dreams?

564
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,303
Does that turn you on?

565
00:28:17,521 --> 00:28:19,132
Does it turn me on?

566
00:28:19,567 --> 00:28:21,874
Maybe somebody's
dreaming about me right now.

567
00:28:23,136 --> 00:28:25,138
- Yeah.
- Maybe a bunch of people,

568
00:28:25,878 --> 00:28:27,401
at the same time.

569
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:29,708
How many?

570
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,623
Hundreds?
Maybe thousands?

571
00:28:32,623 --> 00:28:36,018
Oh, that is
so irresponsible of you.

572
00:28:36,018 --> 00:28:37,628
I can't accept that.

573
00:28:37,628 --> 00:28:39,413
What are you
gonna do about it?

574
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:43,852
I'm gonna make sure
you stay right here.

575
00:29:50,092 --> 00:29:52,312
I have to kill you, Paul.

576
00:29:53,704 --> 00:29:55,010
I have to!

577
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:56,490
What are you...
what are you doing?

578
00:29:56,838 --> 00:29:58,274
- Who are you?

579
00:29:58,274 --> 00:29:59,667
Call the police.

580
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:00,886
What are you
doing in our house?

581
00:30:00,886 --> 00:30:02,844
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Get out!

582
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:04,324
Oh, my God.

583
00:30:04,324 --> 00:30:06,108
Hannah,
Sophie, stay back!

584
00:30:06,108 --> 00:30:07,327
Mom! Mom!

585
00:30:07,327 --> 00:30:08,850
Do something!
Hannah...

586
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:11,505
Hannah, take Sophie
to your room and lock the door.

587
00:30:11,505 --> 00:30:12,854
I'm sorry.

588
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:16,031
- Put down the knife.
- I can't, I have to kill you.

589
00:30:16,031 --> 00:30:17,424
Do something, Paul!

590
00:30:17,424 --> 00:30:19,469
I have to. I have to.

591
00:30:19,469 --> 00:30:20,906
He's in our bedroom...

592
00:30:21,297 --> 00:30:22,864
I have to kill you.

593
00:30:25,911 --> 00:30:28,914
He's had manic
episodes in the past.

594
00:30:28,914 --> 00:30:31,481
It seems that he stopped
taking his medications.

595
00:30:32,482 --> 00:30:34,136
So... so,
what's gonna happen to him?

596
00:30:34,136 --> 00:30:37,139
A psych evaluation,
date with the court,

597
00:30:37,139 --> 00:30:38,662
and then
a judge will decide.

598
00:30:38,662 --> 00:30:40,229
So, he might be back out?

599
00:30:41,665 --> 00:30:44,755
After possibly
serving a sentence, yes.

600
00:30:47,715 --> 00:30:49,804
You know,
fame can come with some

601
00:30:49,804 --> 00:30:51,762
less-than-desirable
side effects.

602
00:30:52,198 --> 00:30:54,591
Strangers might
want to talk to you,

603
00:30:54,591 --> 00:30:56,550
some of them might
be mentally unstable.

604
00:30:57,203 --> 00:30:58,813
You should
be prepared for that.

605
00:30:58,813 --> 00:31:00,032
I'm not getting a gun.

606
00:31:00,032 --> 00:31:02,599
Well, I'm not
necessarily talking weapons.

607
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:04,253
You have no alarm
in the house.

608
00:31:04,253 --> 00:31:05,820
<i>You had
an unlocked entry point.</i>

609
00:31:06,603 --> 00:31:07,866
<i>That makes you vulnerable.</i>

610
00:31:08,954 --> 00:31:11,347
<i>You could consider a dog.</i>

611
00:31:12,044 --> 00:31:14,829
<i>Sophie,
our daughter, is allergic.</i>

612
00:31:15,438 --> 00:31:17,614
<i>Well, then
you may want to consider</i>

613
00:31:17,614 --> 00:31:19,225
<i>moving to a new house.</i>

614
00:31:19,225 --> 00:31:20,922
<i>Keep your phone number
and address unlisted.</i>

615
00:31:20,922 --> 00:31:23,490
<i>No, we're not moving,
I grew up in this house.</i>

616
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:26,972
<i>Security cameras, tasers,</i>

617
00:31:26,972 --> 00:31:28,625
<i>strengthening your deadbolts,</i>

618
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:32,107
<i>securing your windows,
self-defense classes.</i>

619
00:31:32,586 --> 00:31:35,589
It seems like you were pretty
helpless in this situation.

620
00:31:37,721 --> 00:31:39,723
Maybe we should
cool this thing off.

621
00:31:39,723 --> 00:31:42,509
You know, this is why
I was skeptical
in the first place.

622
00:31:42,509 --> 00:31:44,990
Oh, you knew specifically
that this would happen?

623
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:47,993
This kind of thing, Paul.
Strange consequences.

624
00:31:51,474 --> 00:31:53,041
I think she's right.

625
00:31:53,041 --> 00:31:54,608
Take it as a warning.

626
00:31:55,565 --> 00:31:57,916
I really feel like
you're playing with fire here.

627
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,743
What do you mean,
what am I doing?

628
00:31:59,743 --> 00:32:02,746
Going on TV,
playing along with the story.

629
00:32:02,746 --> 00:32:06,054
This thing is clearly working
like catnip for lunatics.

630
00:32:06,054 --> 00:32:08,317
What do you mean,
playing along?

631
00:32:08,317 --> 00:32:10,537
Do you actually
believe people are

632
00:32:10,537 --> 00:32:11,930
randomly dreaming about you?

633
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,627
You don't think it's
because you're popping up

634
00:32:13,627 --> 00:32:15,759
all over the news
and on the internet?

635
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:17,500
Yeah, maybe
that accounts for some of it,

636
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,589
but it doesn't
really explain everything.

637
00:32:19,589 --> 00:32:22,331
Okay, so, you think
something magical is happening?

638
00:32:22,331 --> 00:32:23,767
Well, why is it just me?

639
00:32:23,767 --> 00:32:25,944
Why not you,
or anyone else for that matter?

640
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,337
So, you believe in metaphysics

641
00:32:28,337 --> 00:32:29,904
if it proves you're special?

642
00:32:30,426 --> 00:32:31,645
No.

643
00:32:33,777 --> 00:32:35,997
I don't know,
I'm still processing it.

644
00:32:35,997 --> 00:32:37,999
But that guy was just
some delusional man

645
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:39,392
with his own wild ideas.

646
00:32:39,392 --> 00:32:42,090
I don't think that's going
to be a recurring event.

647
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:43,787
But why risk it?

648
00:32:43,787 --> 00:32:46,616
Well, if people know
who I am, it's just easier

649
00:32:46,616 --> 00:32:48,357
for me to get
my foot in the door.

650
00:32:48,357 --> 00:32:50,707
Which door are
we talking about here, Paul?

651
00:32:52,535 --> 00:32:55,843
A publisher,
for the book I want to write.

652
00:32:55,843 --> 00:32:57,627
Oh, okay.

653
00:32:58,715 --> 00:33:01,805
Am I sensing a little
midlife crisis here?

654
00:33:01,805 --> 00:33:03,851
Oh, come on.

655
00:33:04,373 --> 00:33:07,115
You're the one who just
bought a fucking Kawasaki!

656
00:33:07,115 --> 00:33:08,769
Okay. Calm down.

657
00:33:26,787 --> 00:33:28,789
- Paul?
Hi, yes.

658
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:30,573
Hi, I'm Molly.
They're ready for you upstairs.

659
00:33:30,573 --> 00:33:31,661
Great.

660
00:33:34,403 --> 00:33:36,275
- What?
- It... it... it's nothing.

661
00:33:36,797 --> 00:33:38,407
No, come on.

662
00:33:38,407 --> 00:33:40,714
It's just really weird
to see you in real life.

663
00:33:40,714 --> 00:33:42,498
Oh, you've been...

664
00:33:42,498 --> 00:33:44,239
Nonstop every night.

665
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:46,415
It's crazy, man.

666
00:33:46,981 --> 00:33:50,550
Wow. Well,
I hope I'm behaving.

667
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:54,162
Well, no, you're not.
No, not at all.

668
00:33:54,684 --> 00:33:55,859
Got Paul here.

669
00:33:56,425 --> 00:33:58,340
There you are.
- Here I am.

670
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,168
Paul. Trent, hey.

671
00:34:00,603 --> 00:34:02,170
I have been dreaming
about this meeting.

672
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:04,390
- Aw, yeah, me, too.
- Really?

673
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:06,609
Oh, you mean
literally dreaming?

674
00:34:06,609 --> 00:34:08,785
You know, I've
actually had dreams
about this very meeting.

675
00:34:08,785 --> 00:34:10,700
I mean, I just think
they were just normal dreams.

676
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,790
Not part of the whole,
who's this weird guy
in my dreams?

677
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:16,358
Oh, uh... I'm weird?

678
00:34:16,358 --> 00:34:18,795
No, I mean, you're not weird.
No, the whole thing
is weird, right?

679
00:34:18,795 --> 00:34:20,145
I mean, Molly's dreams
have been nuts...

680
00:34:20,145 --> 00:34:21,624
- Trent!
If you wanna
talk about weird.

681
00:34:21,624 --> 00:34:23,539
But this is my colleague,
Mary Wiggins.

682
00:34:23,539 --> 00:34:25,802
Hi.
- Hi, Paul.

683
00:34:25,802 --> 00:34:26,890
Sit down.

684
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:28,240
Here?
- Wherever you want.

685
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,371
Yeah.

686
00:34:30,459 --> 00:34:32,244
How are you? How's life?

687
00:34:32,244 --> 00:34:36,422
Well, uh, things
have been pretty different

688
00:34:36,422 --> 00:34:38,424
since, you know...
since the dreams started.

689
00:34:38,424 --> 00:34:39,990
How fun is that?

690
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:42,123
I mean, I wish I was the one
people were dreaming about.

691
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:43,429
- Me, too.
Yeah.

692
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:45,648
No, it's... it's something.

693
00:34:45,648 --> 00:34:48,651
Well, we're... we're just
so excited to have you here.

694
00:34:48,651 --> 00:34:50,305
Oh, yeah,
we're really fired up.

695
00:34:50,305 --> 00:34:52,046
Um, it's probably
really overwhelming,

696
00:34:52,046 --> 00:34:53,482
right, to walk
into a room like this.

697
00:34:53,482 --> 00:34:54,875
It's like,
"Who are these people?

698
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:56,398
What am I doing here?"

699
00:34:56,398 --> 00:34:58,661
Maybe we should back up
and just talk about what we do.

700
00:34:58,661 --> 00:35:01,099
Yeah, yeah, so, we started
Thoughts earlier this year,

701
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,796
- so we're a pretty new agency.
- Ah.

702
00:35:02,796 --> 00:35:04,972
And we focus
mostly online,

703
00:35:04,972 --> 00:35:08,149
sort of trying
to holistically pair brands

704
00:35:08,149 --> 00:35:11,283
and more, shall we say,
unconventional celebrities,

705
00:35:11,283 --> 00:35:12,762
if that makes sense?

706
00:35:12,762 --> 00:35:16,157
And I think of you,
right now, in this moment,

707
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:19,987
Paul, as the most interesting
person in the world.

708
00:35:19,987 --> 00:35:21,249
What?

709
00:35:21,249 --> 00:35:22,555
I mean it, I mean it.

710
00:35:22,555 --> 00:35:23,860
No, we don't
just throw that around.

711
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,211
No, we really
don't throw that around.

712
00:35:26,211 --> 00:35:28,169
I mean, the advantage
that you have, Paul,

713
00:35:28,169 --> 00:35:31,085
is that your impact is...
is not just tied

714
00:35:31,085 --> 00:35:32,869
to any one social arena.

715
00:35:32,869 --> 00:35:34,828
I mean, you're not just famous
for people on TikTok

716
00:35:34,828 --> 00:35:37,178
or for people who read,
say, the New Yorker,

717
00:35:37,178 --> 00:35:40,703
you're in people's minds
when they sleep.

718
00:35:40,703 --> 00:35:43,489
Which means
that anyone who's dreaming,

719
00:35:43,489 --> 00:35:45,404
you know,
could be your audience.

720
00:35:45,404 --> 00:35:46,753
How amazing is that?

721
00:35:46,753 --> 00:35:47,754
Who can say that?

722
00:35:49,364 --> 00:35:50,931
You know,
is that a big enough audience?

723
00:35:50,931 --> 00:35:52,193
- Yeah.

724
00:35:52,193 --> 00:35:53,412
So, you know,
we've been brainstorming

725
00:35:53,412 --> 00:35:54,717
a bunch of cool ideas

726
00:35:54,717 --> 00:35:56,241
that we want
to talk about with you.

727
00:35:56,241 --> 00:35:57,894
But before
we get into any of that,

728
00:35:57,894 --> 00:36:00,070
we were just kind of curious
what you're thinking, you know,

729
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:02,072
where do you wanna go,
what do you want to achieve?

730
00:36:02,072 --> 00:36:03,944
- What are your dreams?
What are <i>your</i> dreams?

731
00:36:03,944 --> 00:36:06,816
Well, I've been meaning
to write a book

732
00:36:06,816 --> 00:36:08,470
for a few years now.

733
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:10,211
Just never found
the time, so...

734
00:36:10,211 --> 00:36:11,821
Okay, so, you're a writer?

735
00:36:11,821 --> 00:36:12,953
That's awesome.

736
00:36:13,562 --> 00:36:15,956
You know, we...
we talked about selling

737
00:36:15,956 --> 00:36:17,740
your life rights to
a movie studio, actually.

738
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,655
Oh, because with
all the buzz around this,

739
00:36:19,655 --> 00:36:21,962
I think we could probably
get a six-figure deal.

740
00:36:21,962 --> 00:36:23,355
And that's just life rights.

741
00:36:23,355 --> 00:36:24,747
Really?
Yeah.

742
00:36:24,747 --> 00:36:26,140
- Life rights?
Yeah.

743
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,533
The rights to your life.

744
00:36:27,533 --> 00:36:29,926
Anyway,
here's somewhere cool

745
00:36:29,926 --> 00:36:32,364
that we thought might be
a good place to start.

746
00:36:33,234 --> 00:36:34,627
Sprite.

747
00:36:34,627 --> 00:36:36,237
Sprite.

748
00:36:36,237 --> 00:36:37,673
- Sprite?
Yeah.

749
00:36:37,673 --> 00:36:40,023
Yeah. They... they want us
to run their social.

750
00:36:40,023 --> 00:36:42,069
I think somebody over there
must have lost their minds

751
00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:43,549
or something,
but they're down

752
00:36:43,549 --> 00:36:44,767
to go pretty weird with it.

753
00:36:44,767 --> 00:36:46,552
So, we thought
it could be fun

754
00:36:46,552 --> 00:36:48,945
if maybe they, like,
Tweet a new photo of you

755
00:36:48,945 --> 00:36:50,469
every night holding a can,
you know,

756
00:36:50,469 --> 00:36:51,905
with a fun little caption,

757
00:36:51,905 --> 00:36:53,994
just to really manifest
that connection

758
00:36:53,994 --> 00:36:56,083
in people's minds
and to hopefully alter

759
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:57,954
the phenomenon,
at least temporarily,

760
00:36:57,954 --> 00:37:01,567
to make people
dream about you
and the product together.

761
00:37:01,567 --> 00:37:03,699
How amazing
would that be, right?

762
00:37:03,699 --> 00:37:05,266
And if we couldn't
figure that out,

763
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:08,226
we could always just
suggest that it did work

764
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,618
and we could build stories
around that.

765
00:37:09,618 --> 00:37:10,837
Yeah.
Absolutely.

766
00:37:10,837 --> 00:37:12,273
I mean, if we fail
altogether, then we...

767
00:37:12,273 --> 00:37:13,666
that's kind of
a fun story, too.

768
00:37:13,666 --> 00:37:15,407
You know, like,
we tried to make people dream

769
00:37:15,407 --> 00:37:17,278
about Sprite
and it didn't work.

770
00:37:17,278 --> 00:37:18,801
- I mean, it's so dumb...
I love that.

771
00:37:18,801 --> 00:37:20,803
...that it's kind of cool,
you know, it kind of works.

772
00:37:20,803 --> 00:37:22,283
- Can I just...
- Yeah.

773
00:37:22,283 --> 00:37:24,111
Can we go back to the book?

774
00:37:24,851 --> 00:37:25,939
- What book?
My book.

775
00:37:25,939 --> 00:37:27,332
The book I wanna write?

776
00:37:27,332 --> 00:37:28,811
I just want to make it clear

777
00:37:28,811 --> 00:37:31,510
that I actually don't want
this whole phenomenon

778
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,728
to be what I'm known for.

779
00:37:32,728 --> 00:37:34,687
I don't want that
to be the main thing

780
00:37:34,687 --> 00:37:36,515
on my Wikipedia, you know?

781
00:37:36,515 --> 00:37:41,215
Okay.
So, what are you thinking?

782
00:37:41,215 --> 00:37:43,435
Well, I'm an
evolutionary biologist.

783
00:37:43,435 --> 00:37:45,132
That's what
I've dedicated my life to.

784
00:37:45,132 --> 00:37:47,700
So, whatever we do,
I want it to be related

785
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,875
to my doctorate.

786
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:50,442
Wow. Wow.
Okay. See, I...

787
00:37:50,442 --> 00:37:51,704
I didn't know
about that at all.

788
00:37:51,704 --> 00:37:53,009
Well, you're famous
for the dreams, right?

789
00:37:53,009 --> 00:37:54,533
I mean, that's... that's
why anyone's interested.

790
00:37:54,533 --> 00:37:56,230
So, it might be
a bit of a stretch

791
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,971
to get you into
a totally different space.

792
00:37:57,971 --> 00:37:59,102
Yeah.

793
00:37:59,799 --> 00:38:03,672
I'm a tenured professor.
I'm already <i>in</i> the space.

794
00:38:03,672 --> 00:38:05,935
Well, you know, just
to give us a point of contact

795
00:38:05,935 --> 00:38:07,241
as to what
we're talking about,

796
00:38:07,241 --> 00:38:09,199
who are some of the big names
that you like

797
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:10,331
- in that space?
- Yeah.

798
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:12,551
Well, there's a bunch,
Robert Sapolsky.

799
00:38:12,551 --> 00:38:14,379
His career
has been pretty admirable.

800
00:38:14,379 --> 00:38:15,510
Oh, is he, um...

801
00:38:17,382 --> 00:38:19,558
No, I don't think
I'm familiar with
him, actually.

802
00:38:19,558 --> 00:38:21,211
Herman Tig, maybe?

803
00:38:21,211 --> 00:38:22,735
- Who?
- Herman Tig.

804
00:38:23,649 --> 00:38:25,433
Yeah.
No, I know that name.

805
00:38:25,433 --> 00:38:26,956
Oh, you do?
- Yeah.

806
00:38:26,956 --> 00:38:29,132
Well, these are not
really celebrities, I suppose.

807
00:38:29,132 --> 00:38:31,221
No, that's the point,
I don't care about fame.

808
00:38:31,221 --> 00:38:32,788
I just see this
as an opportunity

809
00:38:32,788 --> 00:38:34,660
to get some recognition
for my work.

810
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,879
You know, one door
opening another door?

811
00:38:36,879 --> 00:38:38,011
Yeah.
No, I get that.

812
00:38:38,011 --> 00:38:39,186
You're talking
about an audience pivot,

813
00:38:39,186 --> 00:38:40,492
which I think is very smart.

814
00:38:40,492 --> 00:38:42,189
I just don't know
if you can pivot that hard

815
00:38:42,189 --> 00:38:44,147
right now without
a significant drop-off.

816
00:38:44,147 --> 00:38:45,845
I mean,
a book about what, plants?

817
00:38:45,845 --> 00:38:48,326
Yeah, well, I'm not
really interested
in doing Sprite ads.

818
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,197
No, no, no. Well, that's
just one example, though, Paul.

819
00:38:50,197 --> 00:38:51,764
I mean, we have
a ton of ideas.

820
00:38:51,764 --> 00:38:54,288
Oh, that is just
the very tip of the iceberg.

821
00:38:54,288 --> 00:38:55,289
We have so many ideas.

822
00:38:55,289 --> 00:38:57,726
Um, one idea we had was

823
00:38:57,726 --> 00:39:00,860
to make Obama
dream about you.

824
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:03,558
That would get you into some
of those high-culture spaces

825
00:39:03,558 --> 00:39:04,690
you've been mentioning.

826
00:39:05,212 --> 00:39:08,171
I know Malia,
so we can make it happen.

827
00:39:08,171 --> 00:39:10,260
Maybe this isn't
really what I'm looking for.

828
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,523
I don't think
we're really speaking

829
00:39:11,523 --> 00:39:13,394
- the same language here.
No, Paul.

830
00:39:13,394 --> 00:39:16,092
If that's how you're feeling,
then I'm failing, okay?

831
00:39:16,092 --> 00:39:18,573
Can we just can... can...
can I... can we start over?

832
00:39:47,036 --> 00:39:49,430
I just thought you guys
could help me find a publisher.

833
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,562
- I... I... I...
- First off,

834
00:39:50,562 --> 00:39:51,824
I would like to apologize.

835
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:55,654
I lied earlier.
I never dreamt about you.

836
00:39:55,654 --> 00:39:57,351
I just thought
that would be a fun way

837
00:39:57,351 --> 00:39:58,439
to start the meeting, okay?

838
00:39:58,439 --> 00:39:59,701
But what is absolutely true

839
00:39:59,701 --> 00:40:00,963
is that I have been thinking

840
00:40:00,963 --> 00:40:02,574
about you a lot

841
00:40:02,574 --> 00:40:04,967
and I just really feel
that we're gonna do

842
00:40:04,967 --> 00:40:06,752
something
very special together.

843
00:40:06,752 --> 00:40:09,232
So let's just say
we go forward
with your plant book.

844
00:40:09,232 --> 00:40:11,887
I never said anything
about plants.

845
00:40:11,887 --> 00:40:14,977
Oh, no. Your... your book
about evolutionary...

846
00:40:14,977 --> 00:40:16,892
- Plants.
- It's about ants.

847
00:40:16,892 --> 00:40:18,285
- Ants.
Ants.

848
00:40:18,285 --> 00:40:19,982
- Oh. Oh.
Okay, great.

849
00:40:19,982 --> 00:40:21,593
Well, let's say
we go forward with that.

850
00:40:22,071 --> 00:40:23,421
We'll help you set that up.

851
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,466
- Really?
Yes. I just...

852
00:40:25,466 --> 00:40:26,902
I really wanna
work with you, Paul.

853
00:40:27,642 --> 00:40:28,817
I mean, like I said,

854
00:40:28,817 --> 00:40:30,776
most interesting person
in the world.

855
00:40:32,778 --> 00:40:35,737
Okay, but then no ads,
no Sprite.

856
00:40:35,737 --> 00:40:37,260
We're focusing on the book.

857
00:40:38,087 --> 00:40:39,915
Yes, and, you know,

858
00:40:39,915 --> 00:40:42,440
if you're not feeling Sprite,
we'll respect that.

859
00:40:43,136 --> 00:40:45,181
I would just ask in return
that you hear out

860
00:40:45,181 --> 00:40:47,488
our pitches and just keep
an open mind, you know,

861
00:40:47,488 --> 00:40:49,490
especially with things
like Sprite because, you know,

862
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:50,926
the door is kind
of wide open there...

863
00:40:50,926 --> 00:40:52,188
Yeah.
- ...right now.

864
00:40:52,188 --> 00:40:53,363
And they're...
they're ready to have

865
00:40:53,363 --> 00:40:54,495
that conversation with you.

866
00:40:54,495 --> 00:40:55,801
And that door closes,
I'll just say.

867
00:41:01,328 --> 00:41:02,677
Yeah, okay.

868
00:41:04,374 --> 00:41:05,811
So, plans for the night?

869
00:41:06,638 --> 00:41:10,293
Oh, no, I've got a really
early flight back, so...

870
00:41:15,647 --> 00:41:17,649
If you want to get a drink,
just let me know.

871
00:41:17,649 --> 00:41:19,259
I can come near you,
if that's easier.

872
00:41:20,086 --> 00:41:21,566
They have you
at the Ace, right?

873
00:41:21,566 --> 00:41:23,263
They were so great.

874
00:41:23,263 --> 00:41:24,743
They really know their stuff.

875
00:41:24,743 --> 00:41:26,614
They're gonna set me up
with a publisher

876
00:41:26,614 --> 00:41:28,181
and get the book rolling.

877
00:41:28,181 --> 00:41:29,530
<i>Wow, that's great!</i>

878
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:30,923
<i>Now you just have to write it.</i>

879
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:33,447
Yeah, of course.

880
00:41:33,447 --> 00:41:34,666
<i>So, what did they say?</i>

881
00:41:34,666 --> 00:41:37,146
They called me
the most interesting person

882
00:41:37,146 --> 00:41:38,844
in the world right now.

883
00:41:38,844 --> 00:41:41,324
<i>Aw.</i>

884
00:41:41,324 --> 00:41:42,891
- What?
- <i>No, nothing.</i>

885
00:41:42,891 --> 00:41:44,371
<i>I'm sure
that's very flattering.</i>

886
00:41:44,371 --> 00:41:45,851
No, they specifically said

887
00:41:45,851 --> 00:41:47,592
they didn't
just throw that around.

888
00:41:47,592 --> 00:41:48,723
<i>Okay.</i>

889
00:41:49,158 --> 00:41:50,856
I don't think they were
just saying it

890
00:41:50,856 --> 00:41:52,248
to make me feel good, Janet,

891
00:41:52,248 --> 00:41:54,163
they're already talking
to big clients

892
00:41:54,163 --> 00:41:55,600
who want to work
with me.

893
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,905
<i>Like who?</i>

894
00:41:57,471 --> 00:42:00,561
Like, I mean... well,
and this is just one example,

895
00:42:00,561 --> 00:42:02,432
but they mentioned Sprite.

896
00:42:02,911 --> 00:42:06,219
<i>Sprite? You're gonna work
with Sprite?</i>

897
00:42:06,219 --> 00:42:07,786
[ON PHONE] <i>Janet.</i>
<i>I'll be right there.</i>

898
00:42:07,786 --> 00:42:08,917
Who's there?

899
00:42:08,917 --> 00:42:10,223
<i>Chris.</i>

900
00:42:10,223 --> 00:42:11,920
<i>Our deadline is tomorrow,</i>

901
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,226
<i>so we're just here
finishing up.</i>

902
00:42:13,705 --> 00:42:14,836
Right.

903
00:42:15,315 --> 00:42:16,577
Where are the kids?

904
00:42:16,577 --> 00:42:18,231
<i>They're out
trick or treating with Kyle.</i>

905
00:42:18,231 --> 00:42:20,450
Oh, Kyle.

906
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:22,148
Okay.

907
00:42:22,148 --> 00:42:25,107
<i>Yeah, well, congrats, Paul,</i>

908
00:42:25,107 --> 00:42:26,500
<i>I'll see you tomorrow, then.</i>

909
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,936
Yeah, okay.

910
00:42:27,936 --> 00:42:29,677
Well, they... they also talked
about Obama, too,

911
00:42:29,677 --> 00:42:31,549
like maybe
he'll dream about me.

912
00:42:32,114 --> 00:42:33,594
<i>Okay.</i>

913
00:42:33,594 --> 00:42:36,423
I... I'm just saying
it wasn't just Sprite.

914
00:42:36,423 --> 00:42:38,425
<i>You don't
have to impress me, Paul.</i>

915
00:42:38,425 --> 00:42:40,993
<i>- I love you.
<i>I love you, too.</i>

916
00:42:40,993 --> 00:42:43,517
<i>Okay.
See you tomorrow.</i>

917
00:42:43,517 --> 00:42:45,214
<i>Yeah. Bye.</i>

918
00:42:50,742 --> 00:42:52,134
Did you read
that article about people

919
00:42:52,134 --> 00:42:54,049
dreaming backward in Australia?

920
00:42:54,049 --> 00:42:55,485
- No.
- It's 'cause of, like,

921
00:42:55,485 --> 00:42:57,139
the gravitational pull
or something.

922
00:42:57,139 --> 00:42:58,837
They mentioned
you in it, so...

923
00:42:58,837 --> 00:43:00,578
How do they dream
in China, then?

924
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,754
Upside down?

925
00:43:04,799 --> 00:43:07,149
So, how long
have you been a professor?

926
00:43:07,149 --> 00:43:12,590
Oh, wow. I think, what,
about 20 years, since '96.

927
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,548
I was born in '96.

928
00:43:14,548 --> 00:43:15,854
Check, please!

929
00:43:16,463 --> 00:43:17,725
No, no, I'm kidding.

930
00:43:17,725 --> 00:43:19,553
Like... like... like,
you're too young for me.

931
00:43:20,554 --> 00:43:23,339
- Aren't you married?
No, I wasn't implying...

932
00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:24,689
It's a joke.

933
00:43:24,689 --> 00:43:26,560
Yeah, no, I mean, I get it.

934
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,606
Oh, okay.

935
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,433
But yeah,
I... I am married.

936
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:32,610
- How about you?
- No.

937
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,829
I'm not really, like,
seeing anyone or anything.

938
00:43:34,829 --> 00:43:36,352
I'm, like, focusing
on my career right now.

939
00:43:36,352 --> 00:43:37,658
- You know?
Yeah.

940
00:43:37,658 --> 00:43:38,964
You mean with the agency?

941
00:43:38,964 --> 00:43:41,009
You hated it so much,
didn't you?

942
00:43:41,009 --> 00:43:44,709
No, it's just,
it kind of felt like...

943
00:43:45,144 --> 00:43:46,319
Like a cult.

944
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,408
Yeah. Sort of.

945
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,758
I mean, I tried
telling them, like,

946
00:43:50,758 --> 00:43:52,586
"He's a super
smart professor.

947
00:43:52,586 --> 00:43:54,501
"Like, he's gonna
see through the bullshit."

948
00:43:54,501 --> 00:43:58,679
But honestly, though,
like, the Sprite thing is cool.

949
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:00,202
- You should do it.
Yeah?

950
00:44:00,202 --> 00:44:02,117
- Yeah.
- I'm struggling to imagine

951
00:44:02,117 --> 00:44:05,164
anyone seeing my face and
immediately craving a Sprite.

952
00:44:05,164 --> 00:44:06,426
I would.

953
00:44:13,128 --> 00:44:14,521
Can I ask you something?

954
00:44:14,521 --> 00:44:15,653
Yeah, what?

955
00:44:16,001 --> 00:44:18,133
I felt like
you implied something

956
00:44:18,133 --> 00:44:20,658
earlier about your dreams.

957
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:22,877
It's embarrassing.

958
00:44:22,877 --> 00:44:25,401
What, do I...
do I act weird or something?

959
00:44:25,401 --> 00:44:27,055
I don't know if I should say.

960
00:44:27,055 --> 00:44:29,710
Well, it's just dreams,
I won't judge.

961
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:32,365
You don't really get
to decide what happens, so...

962
00:44:32,365 --> 00:44:34,323
Um, well, um...

963
00:44:35,629 --> 00:44:36,717
we fuck.

964
00:44:37,587 --> 00:44:38,980
Really?

965
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:42,897
I have the most
intense sex dreams.

966
00:44:42,897 --> 00:44:46,596
Usually, I'm, like,
home and it's late

967
00:44:46,596 --> 00:44:49,556
<i>and I'm alone and I'm, like,
watching TV or something.</i>

968
00:44:49,556 --> 00:44:50,775
<i>And then...</i>

969
00:44:54,343 --> 00:44:55,344
Is someone there?

970
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:00,828
Who are you?

971
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:06,834
Hello?

972
00:45:12,797 --> 00:45:14,102
Who are you?

973
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,149
How did you get in here?

974
00:45:22,632 --> 00:45:23,982
Please don't hurt me.

975
00:45:33,774 --> 00:45:35,080
I'm so wet.

976
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,173
I'm sorry, I've had,
like, one drink

977
00:45:41,173 --> 00:45:43,349
and I'm, like, no filter.

978
00:45:43,349 --> 00:45:45,351
No, no, it's fine.
It's fine.

979
00:45:45,351 --> 00:45:46,874
No, it's so
graphic, I'm sorry.

980
00:45:46,874 --> 00:45:48,223
I'm glad you told me.

981
00:45:48,223 --> 00:45:49,790
Usually,
what I hear is I'm just

982
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:51,661
passively hanging around.

983
00:45:51,661 --> 00:45:54,142
It's kind of nice
to hear I'm doing something.

984
00:45:54,142 --> 00:45:55,404
Well, I guess I'm lucky.

985
00:45:55,404 --> 00:45:56,754
Well, I don't know about that.

986
00:45:56,754 --> 00:46:00,322
No, it's so good. Trust me.

987
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,935
Do you want another drink?
I need another drink.

988
00:46:03,935 --> 00:46:05,371
- Martini, right?
- Dirty.

989
00:46:13,205 --> 00:46:14,902
Can I... can I get
another cabernet and...

990
00:46:14,902 --> 00:46:16,599
and one martini, please?

991
00:46:28,611 --> 00:46:30,352
And that's
the thing with the zebras.

992
00:46:30,352 --> 00:46:33,007
The camouflage is for blending
in with the herd

993
00:46:33,007 --> 00:46:35,662
because the lion can't just
hunt the whole group.

994
00:46:35,662 --> 00:46:38,665
It has to identify
a single target, right?

995
00:46:38,665 --> 00:46:40,058
What?

996
00:46:40,058 --> 00:46:42,712
Sorry,
but those people
are staring at us.

997
00:46:42,712 --> 00:46:44,018
I mean, at you, obviously.

998
00:46:44,018 --> 00:46:45,498
Jesus, should we not be here,

999
00:46:45,498 --> 00:46:47,195
- maybe, or should we just...
- Why? What's wrong?

1000
00:46:47,195 --> 00:46:49,067
No, I mean...
I just...

1001
00:46:49,067 --> 00:46:51,460
I don't want any rumors
if I'm meeting with Obama.

1002
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:53,593
- What do you mean?
No, I mean,

1003
00:46:53,593 --> 00:46:55,682
I... I'm not used to this.

1004
00:46:56,248 --> 00:46:58,163
- Should we, um...
- What?

1005
00:46:59,904 --> 00:47:01,688
I can't get it out
of my head and I'm, like,

1006
00:47:01,688 --> 00:47:03,255
here with you and,
like, fuck it, okay.

1007
00:47:04,169 --> 00:47:05,518
Can you do me a favor?

1008
00:47:34,416 --> 00:47:36,201
Yeah,
so, this is me.

1009
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:45,036
It's nice.
Small and nice.

1010
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,821
Yeah, well, I don't
have rich parents, so...

1011
00:47:47,821 --> 00:47:49,431
No, it wasn't a jab.

1012
00:47:49,431 --> 00:47:50,824
I mean, it's cozy.

1013
00:47:51,651 --> 00:47:53,000
You've done a good job.

1014
00:47:55,916 --> 00:47:57,178
Sit down.

1015
00:48:11,932 --> 00:48:16,719
- So...
- So... This is insane.

1016
00:48:17,285 --> 00:48:19,418
You have no fucking idea
how crazy this is to me.

1017
00:48:20,506 --> 00:48:23,074
- I shouldn't even be here.
- No, don't leave.

1018
00:48:23,465 --> 00:48:25,946
I... I think I'm a bit drunk.

1019
00:48:25,946 --> 00:48:27,252
Me, too. Just stay.

1020
00:48:27,252 --> 00:48:29,167
You just got here,
just stay for a second.

1021
00:48:34,955 --> 00:48:36,261
Is that a fixed gear?

1022
00:48:37,305 --> 00:48:41,048
No, it's, uh,
like, a regular one.

1023
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:47,925
So, how do we do this?

1024
00:48:48,316 --> 00:48:49,709
Oh, um...

1025
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,279
I feel like
I want to change first.

1026
00:48:54,279 --> 00:48:56,107
- Is that cool?
- Sure.

1027
00:48:56,629 --> 00:48:58,892
Okay. Okay, two seconds.

1028
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,276
Everything good?

1029
00:49:36,712 --> 00:49:38,105
Yeah.

1030
00:49:38,671 --> 00:49:43,937
Um, so, where do you want me?

1031
00:49:45,025 --> 00:49:46,548
Could you remove your jacket?

1032
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,378
Sure.

1033
00:49:54,904 --> 00:49:57,690
Okay, now, would you stand
in that corner over there?

1034
00:49:58,908 --> 00:50:00,432
- Over there?
- Yeah.

1035
00:50:12,487 --> 00:50:14,533
Get all the way
up against the wall.

1036
00:50:38,905 --> 00:50:40,950
- Okay, so, did that work for...
- Sorry, shut up.

1037
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:43,736
Just... can you just...
can you just go on
a little more?

1038
00:50:44,258 --> 00:50:47,174
Just, you know,
I'm... I'm married.

1039
00:50:47,174 --> 00:50:48,915
I know, we can stop
any time you like.

1040
00:50:48,915 --> 00:50:51,178
Just please let me just...
a little longer.

1041
00:50:55,008 --> 00:50:57,228
This time, please don't speak.
Just do the dream.

1042
00:51:13,461 --> 00:51:15,028
Who are you?

1043
00:51:20,947 --> 00:51:22,122
Please don't hurt me.

1044
00:51:30,565 --> 00:51:31,740
Touch me.

1045
00:51:43,361 --> 00:51:44,666
What?

1046
00:51:44,666 --> 00:51:47,452
It's just...
in the dreams you, like...

1047
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,541
you usually take the lead.

1048
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:51,369
Yeah.

1049
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:53,545
What do you want?

1050
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,692
- Oh.

1051
00:52:11,911 --> 00:52:14,392
I'm sorry.
It's just nerves.

1052
00:52:14,392 --> 00:52:15,784
It's okay.
Don't worry.

1053
00:52:16,829 --> 00:52:19,310
- The body sometimes...
- Yeah. It's fine.

1054
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:21,181
Biologically speaking,
it's actually quite...

1055
00:52:21,181 --> 00:52:23,705
- It's... it's fine. Relax.
- It's... it's healthy.

1056
00:52:23,705 --> 00:52:26,143
- Okay.
- Okay.

1057
00:52:56,912 --> 00:52:58,262
Did you just come?

1058
00:54:54,987 --> 00:54:56,118
Fuck!

1059
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:58,382
Fuck!

1060
00:54:59,513 --> 00:55:00,645
Fuck.

1061
00:55:01,733 --> 00:55:02,864
Fuck.

1062
00:55:03,474 --> 00:55:07,042
Yeah, you fuck!

1063
00:55:11,569 --> 00:55:13,310
Fuck!

1064
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:23,885
Professor, what's going on?

1065
00:55:23,885 --> 00:55:26,061
- Can I come in?
Why?

1066
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:28,847
- I need help with something.
- Okay.

1067
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:33,982
- What?
I don't want
to stand here

1068
00:55:33,982 --> 00:55:35,549
in the hallway and explain.

1069
00:55:35,549 --> 00:55:37,377
Well, can it wait?
I'm in the middle
of something.

1070
00:55:37,377 --> 00:55:38,770
Just five minutes.

1071
00:55:39,901 --> 00:55:41,338
I'll come out.

1072
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:43,340
Would be better
if we sat down.

1073
00:55:58,224 --> 00:55:59,747
What's... what's going on?

1074
00:56:00,922 --> 00:56:04,578
- That was a mistake.
- What do you mean?

1075
00:56:04,578 --> 00:56:06,537
What just happened,
that was a mistake.

1076
00:56:08,495 --> 00:56:09,844
You shouldn't have done that.

1077
00:56:09,844 --> 00:56:12,020
I don't understand.

1078
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:14,109
You're just so
fucking stupid sometimes.

1079
00:56:14,109 --> 00:56:17,417
Do you know that?
Have you heard that before?

1080
00:56:20,899 --> 00:56:22,379
Okay. Okay.

1081
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,641
Please leave.

1082
00:57:06,074 --> 00:57:07,249
Where is everyone?

1083
00:57:07,859 --> 00:57:09,251
I'm not really sure.

1084
00:57:11,602 --> 00:57:14,126
- I'm shocked.
- Yeah, and they got worse.

1085
00:57:14,779 --> 00:57:17,477
Some are even
sexual in nature,

1086
00:57:17,477 --> 00:57:20,959
so they don't feel
comfortable being in
your class right now.

1087
00:57:20,959 --> 00:57:23,527
Jesus, they had
some bad dreams

1088
00:57:23,527 --> 00:57:25,877
and now they're not gonna
show up for class?

1089
00:57:25,877 --> 00:57:28,270
I mean,
we can't just accept that.

1090
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:30,882
I don't know
what to do here.
I mean, obviously,

1091
00:57:30,882 --> 00:57:33,493
I have to take the students'
concerns seriously, too.

1092
00:57:33,493 --> 00:57:35,016
Well, yes, of course.

1093
00:57:35,016 --> 00:57:38,411
But isn't this a bit
of an overreaction?

1094
00:57:38,411 --> 00:57:40,282
They're dreams.
It's not real.

1095
00:57:40,282 --> 00:57:42,763
I'm not actually
doing anything to them.

1096
00:57:42,763 --> 00:57:45,462
As I said before,
this is new territory.

1097
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:48,465
Um, I think I just need
to consult with HR.

1098
00:57:52,686 --> 00:57:55,167
Do you, Brett, as my friend,

1099
00:57:55,167 --> 00:57:57,517
and not speaking as
the Dean of Osler,

1100
00:57:57,517 --> 00:57:59,214
think that
we should pause this semester

1101
00:57:59,214 --> 00:58:01,652
because some students
are having bad dreams?

1102
00:58:01,652 --> 00:58:03,784
Well, I haven't had one
of these dreams,

1103
00:58:03,784 --> 00:58:05,307
so I can't speak to the...

1104
00:58:05,307 --> 00:58:08,223
No, no, no,
don't say lived experience.

1105
00:58:08,223 --> 00:58:10,704
But it sounds like they've
actually been traumatized.

1106
00:58:10,704 --> 00:58:13,054
Trauma is a trend these days.

1107
00:58:13,054 --> 00:58:15,448
It is a joke.
Everything is trauma.

1108
00:58:15,448 --> 00:58:17,058
Arguing with a friend
is trauma,

1109
00:58:17,058 --> 00:58:18,582
getting bad grades is trauma.

1110
00:58:18,582 --> 00:58:20,366
They need to grow up.

1111
00:58:24,718 --> 00:58:27,504
- Hi.
- Richard, it's been too long.

1112
00:58:28,722 --> 00:58:30,550
- Are we the first ones?

1113
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:33,553
Uh, actually,
it's... it'll just be us.

1114
00:58:33,553 --> 00:58:35,729
Really? I thought this was
gonna be one of your famous

1115
00:58:35,729 --> 00:58:37,514
bring-people-together things.

1116
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:40,429
Uh, we thought it'd be nicer,
just us four.

1117
00:58:41,561 --> 00:58:44,216
Okay, yeah. More wine for us.

1118
00:58:48,568 --> 00:58:51,310
- Cheers, guys.
- Cheers.

1119
00:58:57,272 --> 00:58:59,579
So, Carlota, I heard you're
at a new practice now.

1120
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:03,148
- Yeah, I am.
- Yeah?

1121
00:59:04,584 --> 00:59:06,064
Yes.

1122
00:59:10,982 --> 00:59:13,288
This is so good, by the way.

1123
00:59:13,288 --> 00:59:15,595
Oh, my gosh, these Brussels
sprouts are amazing.

1124
00:59:15,595 --> 00:59:17,858
Yeah, we got them at, uh...

1125
00:59:20,644 --> 00:59:22,297
- Shelly's.
- Ah.

1126
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:30,044
So, I'm starting to think that
maybe Nick Bostrum was right

1127
00:59:30,044 --> 00:59:31,959
about the simulation theory.

1128
00:59:31,959 --> 00:59:34,571
That would sure explain
a lot about my situation.

1129
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:36,877
Yeah, remember
Nick, Carlota?

1130
00:59:36,877 --> 00:59:39,271
Swedish guy,
philosopher at Oxford.

1131
00:59:39,663 --> 00:59:41,926
- He was here?
- Yeah, once or twice.

1132
00:59:41,926 --> 00:59:43,623
You should invite us
both next time.

1133
00:59:44,058 --> 00:59:45,799
He'd probably love
to speak with me.

1134
00:59:46,757 --> 00:59:49,498
Wasn't I even the one
who told you about him?

1135
00:59:50,151 --> 00:59:52,023
No, I don't think so.

1136
00:59:58,769 --> 01:00:00,640
Carlota, are you still
doing your pottery?

1137
01:00:05,036 --> 01:00:06,646
-  Ah.

1138
01:00:06,646 --> 01:00:08,169
- Oh, don't be so rough.
- What?

1139
01:00:08,169 --> 01:00:09,736
You're slamming my back.

1140
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:14,436
- Sorry.
- Is... is everything good?

1141
01:00:14,436 --> 01:00:17,744
She had a... a rough day
at work today.

1142
01:00:17,744 --> 01:00:19,093
Ah.
- So...

1143
01:00:19,093 --> 01:00:20,529
Okay.

1144
01:00:26,187 --> 01:00:28,755
Oh, no. What's the matter?

1145
01:00:30,888 --> 01:00:32,803
Sorry, can't do this.
I can't.

1146
01:00:39,592 --> 01:00:41,246
What the hell is going on?

1147
01:00:41,246 --> 01:00:42,639
I have no idea.

1148
01:00:45,076 --> 01:00:47,295
- Richard.
- Richard, what's wrong?

1149
01:00:48,427 --> 01:00:52,300
Uh, guys, uh... I think we're
gonna have to wrap this up.

1150
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:54,172
Carlota isn't feeling well.

1151
01:00:54,172 --> 01:00:57,218
Oh, no. Is she ill?

1152
01:00:57,654 --> 01:01:01,614
It...  It's you, Paul.

1153
01:01:03,007 --> 01:01:07,141
She's had some pretty brutal
nightmares lately.

1154
01:01:07,141 --> 01:01:11,450
Oh, wow. I just couldn't...

1155
01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:13,800
I'm so sorry,
you could have told us.

1156
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,715
I convinced her not to cancel.

1157
01:01:15,715 --> 01:01:18,631
- I shouldn't have done that.

1158
01:01:18,631 --> 01:01:21,416
Well, shouldn't
the three of us
still finish, though?

1159
01:01:21,416 --> 01:01:24,985
- It'd be a waste to just...
- No, you... you have to leave.

1160
01:01:26,291 --> 01:01:28,685
- Really?
Yeah, really.

1161
01:01:29,207 --> 01:01:31,383
Why do you think
no one else is here?

1162
01:01:35,779 --> 01:01:39,957
The basic idea
with cognitive
behavioral therapy

1163
01:01:39,957 --> 01:01:43,264
is that we'll go through
gradual exposure

1164
01:01:43,264 --> 01:01:45,310
to what we feel
is threatening us

1165
01:01:45,310 --> 01:01:48,052
to familiarize with it,
instead of fearing it.

1166
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:51,011
What doesn't kill us makes us
stronger, right?

1167
01:01:51,838 --> 01:01:53,710
I know a lot of you have had

1168
01:01:54,449 --> 01:01:56,451
very upsetting dreams
about your professor.

1169
01:01:58,758 --> 01:02:01,543
These dreams suggest
that Paul Matthews

1170
01:02:01,543 --> 01:02:03,023
is a harmful person.

1171
01:02:04,329 --> 01:02:06,853
So, your mind is trying
to protect you,

1172
01:02:06,853 --> 01:02:11,292
make you safe by creating
certain emotional triggers.

1173
01:02:12,206 --> 01:02:14,121
Motivating you to avoid him.

1174
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:18,082
I want to defuse
those triggers

1175
01:02:18,082 --> 01:02:20,040
by showing you that Paul

1176
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:24,741
is, in fact, a kind, loving,
harmless human being.

1177
01:02:51,811 --> 01:02:56,990
Okay. I'm going to invite
Paul into the room.

1178
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:00,559
He's gonna step
inside that door,

1179
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:02,213
all the way over there

1180
01:03:02,213 --> 01:03:05,651
and he's gonna stay at
that safe distance

1181
01:03:05,869 --> 01:03:08,262
until everybody
feels comfortable

1182
01:03:08,262 --> 01:03:09,611
to invite him closer.

1183
01:03:10,177 --> 01:03:14,399
If anyone feels unsafe,
calmly state,

1184
01:03:14,399 --> 01:03:17,315
"Candice, I do not feel safe
in this moment."

1185
01:03:19,056 --> 01:03:20,884
Does everybody understand that?

1186
01:03:20,884 --> 01:03:22,494
Yes.

1187
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:29,066
All right. Paul!

1188
01:03:44,168 --> 01:03:46,910
Okay. That wasn't
so bad, was it?

1189
01:03:48,085 --> 01:03:49,913
Let's have him step forward.

1190
01:03:49,913 --> 01:03:51,828
Come just a little bit closer.

1191
01:03:52,785 --> 01:03:54,047
Paul.

1192
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:08,192
Paul isn't gonna hurt you.

1193
01:04:09,497 --> 01:04:11,456
Can we have him come just
a little bit closer?

1194
01:04:17,114 --> 01:04:19,072
Paul, step closer, please.

1195
01:04:33,826 --> 01:04:35,393
So...

1196
01:04:35,393 --> 01:04:36,742
Leah, wait.

1197
01:04:36,742 --> 01:04:38,613
Look what you did...

1198
01:05:15,563 --> 01:05:17,217
Hey! Hey!

1199
01:05:18,436 --> 01:05:19,741
Who did this?

1200
01:05:21,178 --> 01:05:22,527
Tell me now.

1201
01:05:23,963 --> 01:05:25,965
Stop being little
fucking brats.

1202
01:05:27,967 --> 01:05:29,926
Who the fuck did this?

1203
01:05:32,015 --> 01:05:34,756
- Fuck you, Matthews.
Go home!

1204
01:05:34,756 --> 01:05:36,410
Why don't
you just quit, Paul?

1205
01:05:36,410 --> 01:05:38,021
- Bye, Paul.
- Bye.

1206
01:05:38,021 --> 01:05:39,544
- Bye.

1207
01:05:39,544 --> 01:05:40,937
So, what did Brett say?

1208
01:05:41,459 --> 01:05:43,374
See it as
a little vacation.

1209
01:05:44,070 --> 01:05:45,854
Can you believe it?

1210
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:48,683
I'm a tenured professor
and they're basically

1211
01:05:48,683 --> 01:05:50,250
just letting the students
run the school.

1212
01:05:51,251 --> 01:05:52,818
So, how long are you
not gonna be working?

1213
01:05:52,818 --> 01:05:55,125
I don't even know if I want
to go back at this point.

1214
01:05:55,125 --> 01:05:57,344
I should just go all in
with the book.

1215
01:06:00,217 --> 01:06:02,697
So, like, what did you do?
Why did everything change?

1216
01:06:02,697 --> 01:06:05,004
- I didn't do anything, Hannah.
- You must have done something.

1217
01:06:05,004 --> 01:06:08,094
- Well, I didn't, so...
- Have you seen Twitter?

1218
01:06:09,008 --> 01:06:12,011
- No.
- It's like thousands of people

1219
01:06:12,011 --> 01:06:13,621
sharing nightmares
about, like...

1220
01:06:13,621 --> 01:06:16,885
- like, torture and rape and...
- Enough, okay?

1221
01:06:17,538 --> 01:06:18,975
New rule.

1222
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:21,107
No phones at the table

1223
01:06:21,107 --> 01:06:25,111
and no discussion
of the dreams, okay?

1224
01:06:25,111 --> 01:06:27,157
I'm just saying, like,
I... I understand...

1225
01:06:27,157 --> 01:06:28,985
Okay, you already broke
the rule, Hannah.

1226
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:30,421
So, let's just start over.

1227
01:06:30,812 --> 01:06:35,817
No mention of this
at the table
ever again, please.

1228
01:06:39,691 --> 01:06:41,649
Are you gonna clean
that stuff off the car?

1229
01:06:44,435 --> 01:06:46,654
They're kicking me off
the project?

1230
01:06:46,654 --> 01:06:50,354
I think that they
just want to be
extra careful moving into

1231
01:06:50,354 --> 01:06:53,531
the final stages, just as
a precautionary measure.

1232
01:06:53,531 --> 01:06:55,533
Because of Paul?

1233
01:06:56,186 --> 01:06:58,536
Yeah. You know,
I'm against cancel culture

1234
01:06:58,536 --> 01:07:00,625
and all of that stuff,
I really am.

1235
01:07:00,625 --> 01:07:04,237
But I think that just right
now maybe it would be best

1236
01:07:04,237 --> 01:07:07,066
if you kept a lower profile,
you know?

1237
01:07:07,501 --> 01:07:11,636
Just until the whole, like,
scandal situation blows over.

1238
01:07:14,291 --> 01:07:16,554
- Does that make sense?

1239
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:24,431
They call you Freddie Krueger
at school.

1240
01:07:24,823 --> 01:07:27,565
Oh? Do you know who that is?

1241
01:07:27,826 --> 01:07:29,436
I Googled it.

1242
01:07:29,436 --> 01:07:31,917
Yeah, they're just trying
to tease you.

1243
01:07:31,917 --> 01:07:34,006
Julian said that you
tied him up

1244
01:07:34,006 --> 01:07:36,922
and cut his toes off
and ate them.

1245
01:07:36,922 --> 01:07:40,534
Do you think I would cut
someone's toes off?

1246
01:07:43,494 --> 01:07:45,017
No.

1247
01:07:51,806 --> 01:07:54,809
Dreaming is like
a psychosis, Sophie.

1248
01:07:54,809 --> 01:07:58,813
Our brain decides
to start hallucinating
while we sleep.

1249
01:07:59,597 --> 01:08:02,208
It's part of
its housekeeping process.

1250
01:08:02,948 --> 01:08:06,734
We need that to happen,
for some reason.

1251
01:08:08,823 --> 01:08:11,130
But why are you so mean
in the dreams?

1252
01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:14,960
It's their dreams.
I have nothing to do with it.

1253
01:08:15,874 --> 01:08:18,094
You understand that, right?

1254
01:08:18,833 --> 01:08:20,183
I guess.

1255
01:08:21,445 --> 01:08:23,708
I think I'm going to stay
home tomorrow.

1256
01:08:23,708 --> 01:08:26,189
So, if you need me
to cook or something...

1257
01:08:27,668 --> 01:08:30,976
- Who's Molly?
- What?

1258
01:08:30,976 --> 01:08:33,500
You have texts from
someone named Molly?

1259
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:37,983
Oh, she's the assistant
at the agency.

1260
01:08:37,983 --> 01:08:39,941
She's setting up a call.

1261
01:08:39,941 --> 01:08:41,247
Mm.

1262
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:43,597
You never mentioned her.

1263
01:08:55,783 --> 01:08:57,220
Hey, it's Paul.

1264
01:08:58,786 --> 01:09:01,354
I... I was just
calling to say hi.

1265
01:09:04,270 --> 01:09:05,880
<i>Okay, we can
do it another time.</i>

1266
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:09,057
<i>I just... just wanted
to catch up. Yep.</i>

1267
01:09:09,057 --> 01:09:10,668
<i>No worries.
Okay, bye.</i>

1268
01:09:10,668 --> 01:09:12,104
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

1269
01:09:20,373 --> 01:09:22,114
<i>Two seconds, Paul.</i>

1270
01:09:22,114 --> 01:09:23,768
<i>I'm just trying
to connect Mary to the call.</i>

1271
01:09:23,768 --> 01:09:25,117
Yeah, no problem.

1272
01:09:25,813 --> 01:09:27,728
<i>Hi, Paul.</i>
- Who's this?

1273
01:09:28,816 --> 01:09:31,167
<i>It's Molly,
I'm just listening in.</i>

1274
01:09:32,255 --> 01:09:35,997
Hi, Molly. How are you?

1275
01:09:36,650 --> 01:09:38,391
<i>Hello?
Is everybody on?</i>

1276
01:09:38,391 --> 01:09:39,697
I'm here, Trent.

1277
01:09:40,045 --> 01:09:43,222
<i>Hey, Mary, you on?</i>
<i>Oh! Oh, Trent,</i>

1278
01:09:43,222 --> 01:09:45,050
<i>sorry, Mary just texted me
and she had the wrong link.</i>

1279
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:47,705
Should we just start?

1280
01:09:47,705 --> 01:09:50,011
<i>Um, yeah.</i>
<i>Hello?</i>

1281
01:09:50,011 --> 01:09:51,926
<i>Hey, there you are.</i>
<i>Can you guys hear me?</i>

1282
01:09:51,926 --> 01:09:54,451
<i>Yeah. Paul?</i>

1283
01:09:54,451 --> 01:09:57,105
Yeah, I can hear you.
What's going on, guys?

1284
01:09:57,845 --> 01:09:59,934
<i>Okay, hi.
What a crazy week, right?</i>

1285
01:09:59,934 --> 01:10:02,807
<i>So, obviously, we have
to change strategies here</i>

1286
01:10:02,807 --> 01:10:04,548
<i>to adapt
to the current situation.</i>

1287
01:10:04,548 --> 01:10:06,027
Is Obama still a thing?

1288
01:10:06,027 --> 01:10:07,420
That might be
helpful now, right?

1289
01:10:07,420 --> 01:10:08,987
<i>What?</i>

1290
01:10:08,987 --> 01:10:12,208
Obama, you said you guys
were talking to Obama, right?

1291
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:15,863
<i>Oh, I'm... Obama is not
an option anymore, Paul.</i>

1292
01:10:15,863 --> 01:10:17,778
<i>Yeah. No. So, Paul,
we're... we're talking about</i>

1293
01:10:17,778 --> 01:10:19,954
<i>a complete 180.
We have to think fresh.</i>

1294
01:10:19,954 --> 01:10:23,044
<i>Corporate culture won't
touch this. It's too risky.</i>

1295
01:10:23,044 --> 01:10:25,046
<i>Yeah, but we are
getting positive signals</i>

1296
01:10:25,046 --> 01:10:27,266
<i>from a different venue.
The whole,</i>

1297
01:10:27,266 --> 01:10:28,789
<i>I don't wanna say alt-right,</i>

1298
01:10:28,789 --> 01:10:31,270
<i>but the kind of
anti-establishment space,</i>

1299
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:33,316
<i>you know, kind of
the Jordan Peterson route.</i>

1300
01:10:33,316 --> 01:10:36,101
<i>Yeah, we can maybe get
you on Rogan or something.</i>

1301
01:10:36,101 --> 01:10:39,191
<i>Share your experience of being
cancelled and just, like,</i>

1302
01:10:39,191 --> 01:10:41,454
<i>pivot that combo
to the plant book.</i>

1303
01:10:41,454 --> 01:10:45,153
Guys, no. I hate that idea.

1304
01:10:45,153 --> 01:10:47,982
<i>Uh-huh. So, just so
we can understand you better,</i>

1305
01:10:47,982 --> 01:10:49,680
<i>what exactly
are you opposed to?</i>

1306
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:52,465
I don't wanna be some
culture war person.

1307
01:10:52,465 --> 01:10:56,295
I... I... I don't
want to be controversial.

1308
01:10:56,295 --> 01:10:58,210
<i>Okay. Well, yeah,</i>

1309
01:10:58,210 --> 01:11:00,821
<i>this is gonna go
right against what
you're saying right now.</i>

1310
01:11:00,821 --> 01:11:02,736
<i>But there is a chance,
we think, to get you</i>

1311
01:11:02,736 --> 01:11:04,303
<i>- on Tucker Carlson
this week...</i>
<i>Tucker.</i>

1312
01:11:04,303 --> 01:11:06,131
<i>So, that's
a big audience.</i>

1313
01:11:06,131 --> 01:11:07,611
<i>Just think about that.
Don't answer right now.</i>

1314
01:11:07,611 --> 01:11:10,309
<i>And then also,
there's France, Paul.</i>

1315
01:11:10,309 --> 01:11:12,224
<i>For some reason,
they love you over there.</i>

1316
01:11:12,224 --> 01:11:14,226
<i>Even with the nightmares,
they love it.</i>

1317
01:11:14,226 --> 01:11:16,141
<i>Yeah. You're building
a fanbase over there.</i>

1318
01:11:16,141 --> 01:11:18,796
Isn't there some type
of charity I can do, maybe?

1319
01:11:19,536 --> 01:11:21,233
<i>No, that's sweet.
But no.</i>

1320
01:11:21,233 --> 01:11:23,104
<i>It might seem apologetic.</i>

1321
01:11:30,634 --> 01:11:33,289
- Hi.
- It's good, thanks.

1322
01:11:36,379 --> 01:11:38,424
- What?
- I'm so sorry, sir.

1323
01:11:38,424 --> 01:11:41,253
I hate to do this, but there are
some people that

1324
01:11:41,253 --> 01:11:43,516
aren't really that comfortable
with the fact that you're here.

1325
01:11:47,738 --> 01:11:49,870
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1326
01:11:49,870 --> 01:11:51,263
Well, if they're
so uncomfortable,

1327
01:11:51,263 --> 01:11:52,612
maybe they should leave.

1328
01:11:52,612 --> 01:11:54,353
Um, yeah, but...

1329
01:11:54,353 --> 01:11:55,746
I'm just enjoying my meal.

1330
01:11:55,746 --> 01:11:57,269
I haven't said
or done anything.

1331
01:11:57,269 --> 01:11:59,576
Right. I mean,
I guess I could tell them

1332
01:11:59,576 --> 01:12:02,056
- you're about to leave, or...
- Why should I leave?

1333
01:12:02,056 --> 01:12:04,320
I haven't broken any
of your rules, have I?

1334
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,147
- I mean, no.
Well, great.

1335
01:12:06,147 --> 01:12:09,934
- Then that's that.
Uh, yeah, I guess.

1336
01:12:09,934 --> 01:12:11,327
Okay.

1337
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:24,296
Hey, hi.

1338
01:12:25,253 --> 01:12:27,778
Would you do us a favor
and just wrap that up?

1339
01:12:28,605 --> 01:12:30,084
Nobody wants
you here, man.

1340
01:12:30,084 --> 01:12:31,521
Well, I'm staying.

1341
01:12:32,957 --> 01:12:34,959
Are you sure about that?
- Yeah, I'm going to enjoy

1342
01:12:34,959 --> 01:12:37,701
my food and leave
when I'm done, okay?

1343
01:12:39,006 --> 01:12:40,007
Okay.

1344
01:12:54,195 --> 01:12:56,807
<i>♪ When I know
It will happen soon</i>

1345
01:12:56,807 --> 01:13:00,376
<i>♪ Early blue come
To my room next morning</i>

1346
01:13:04,336 --> 01:13:08,166
<i>♪ And I'll try to go to sleep
But it won't work</i>

1347
01:13:08,166 --> 01:13:11,604
<i>♪ I'll have to see
My friends</i>

1348
01:13:11,604 --> 01:13:13,345
<i>♪ Where they go</i>

1349
01:13:14,259 --> 01:13:17,131
<i>♪ What they know</i>

1350
01:13:21,005 --> 01:13:24,051
<i>♪ And I run away</i>

1351
01:13:26,619 --> 01:13:29,579
Listen,
maybe you need to be
more proactive about this.

1352
01:13:30,362 --> 01:13:31,711
What do you mean?

1353
01:13:32,712 --> 01:13:35,280
Make a public statement
or something?

1354
01:13:36,586 --> 01:13:39,371
- Maybe you should apologize.
I should apologize?

1355
01:13:39,371 --> 01:13:42,026
Take a look at my face
for Christ's sake.

1356
01:13:42,026 --> 01:13:45,377
Well, just to get people
off your back... off our backs.

1357
01:13:45,377 --> 01:13:47,640
No, that's ridiculous.
I'm not gonna do that.

1358
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:50,426
You're not alone in this.
I almost lost my job.

1359
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:53,733
Which is completely
uncalled for.

1360
01:13:53,733 --> 01:13:55,866
Sophie is being picked on
at school.

1361
01:13:55,866 --> 01:13:57,258
Hannah is depressed.

1362
01:13:58,216 --> 01:14:01,175
We get weird phone calls
in the middle of the night.

1363
01:14:01,175 --> 01:14:03,308
Someone... someone
broke into our house.

1364
01:14:03,308 --> 01:14:05,876
So, we're just gonna let
the terrorists win?

1365
01:14:05,876 --> 01:14:08,792
Who's to say anything will
be different if I do apologize?

1366
01:14:08,792 --> 01:14:10,489
Oh, so, basically,
you're just choosing for us

1367
01:14:10,489 --> 01:14:11,577
to be more miserable.

1368
01:14:11,577 --> 01:14:13,536
Would you...
would you fucking stop?

1369
01:14:28,507 --> 01:14:29,943
Hey!

1370
01:17:00,659 --> 01:17:04,228
It seems like there's consensus
amongst the parents,

1371
01:17:04,228 --> 01:17:06,665
and if it's not
too much to ask,

1372
01:17:06,665 --> 01:17:08,885
we'd like you
to sit this one out.

1373
01:17:08,885 --> 01:17:11,452
But it is,
it is too much to ask.

1374
01:17:11,452 --> 01:17:14,325
It's ridiculous.
This is a huge moment for her.

1375
01:17:14,325 --> 01:17:15,761
Of course,
I'm going to be there.

1376
01:17:15,761 --> 01:17:17,110
Paul, please.

1377
01:17:17,110 --> 01:17:18,677
What? They're imposing
an exile. Am I supposed

1378
01:17:18,677 --> 01:17:20,331
- to just accept that?
- Don't be so dramatic.

1379
01:17:20,331 --> 01:17:21,898
We'll get someone
to record it, okay?

1380
01:17:21,898 --> 01:17:23,334
You'll...
Um, you'll get to see it.

1381
01:17:23,334 --> 01:17:25,684
Just not in the room
on the night.

1382
01:17:27,425 --> 01:17:29,427
You're aware that
I have a Ph.D., right?

1383
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:33,213
- Yes.
- And you, B.A.?

1384
01:17:33,213 --> 01:17:35,172
- M.A.
- What I'm saying is,

1385
01:17:35,172 --> 01:17:37,740
I don't need
your opinions on pedagogy.

1386
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:39,916
Okay, I understand
that you want to be there.

1387
01:17:39,916 --> 01:17:42,527
But at... at this point, the
majority of the parents don't.

1388
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:45,661
They're worried
their kids will feel
unsafe, and obviously,

1389
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:48,533
that's not, you know,
completely unwarranted.

1390
01:17:48,533 --> 01:17:50,491
Why don't we make it easier
on everyone and you just...

1391
01:17:50,491 --> 01:17:51,797
Why don't
you take my side, Janet?

1392
01:17:51,797 --> 01:17:53,320
Sophie shouldn't have
to be punished

1393
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:55,714
just because you want
to make a point.

1394
01:17:55,714 --> 01:17:57,542
Don't make us all die
on your hill.

1395
01:17:57,542 --> 01:18:00,371
- Hi. Sorry to bother you.

1396
01:18:01,198 --> 01:18:03,156
Do you own that car
that says, "Loser"?

1397
01:18:04,331 --> 01:18:05,506
Yes.

1398
01:18:09,032 --> 01:18:10,642
Where do I begin?

1399
01:18:13,079 --> 01:18:14,994
Let me start with this.

1400
01:18:14,994 --> 01:18:16,474
I'm sorry.

1401
01:18:17,301 --> 01:18:20,608
I'm sorry, I didn't
address this earlier.

1402
01:18:20,608 --> 01:18:23,263
I'm sorry to anyone who's
had one of those terrible,

1403
01:18:23,263 --> 01:18:24,917
terrible nightmares.

1404
01:18:27,441 --> 01:18:31,358
The reason why
I'm so emotionally distressed

1405
01:18:31,358 --> 01:18:34,318
right now is because
I had one myself.

1406
01:18:34,318 --> 01:18:37,974
I've experienced what
so many of you must
have experienced...

1407
01:18:39,976 --> 01:18:44,067
being violently attacked
and abused by a man

1408
01:18:44,067 --> 01:18:45,546
who looks like me.

1409
01:18:45,546 --> 01:18:48,158
I have to stress,
that man is not me.

1410
01:18:50,203 --> 01:18:53,859
And I speak now from
actual lived experience.

1411
01:18:56,470 --> 01:18:57,776
I'm one of you.

1412
01:19:02,912 --> 01:19:09,396
I've been vilified in my life,
haunted in my dreams.

1413
01:19:10,180 --> 01:19:12,486
My mere presence
upsets people

1414
01:19:12,486 --> 01:19:15,315
and not because
I've actually done anything.

1415
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:21,060
But because people imagine
I've done things.

1416
01:19:22,670 --> 01:19:25,978
Is it really fair that
I should be punished for that?

1417
01:19:28,459 --> 01:19:32,985
Am I not the biggest victim
in this whole phenomenon?

1418
01:19:34,595 --> 01:19:37,381
Just look at how
it's affecting my life!

1419
01:19:37,381 --> 01:19:40,601
<i>But because people imagine
I've done things.</i>

1420
01:19:40,601 --> 01:19:41,951
I'm actually gonna
have to kill myself.

1421
01:19:41,951 --> 01:19:43,387
<i>Is it really fair that</i>

1422
01:19:43,387 --> 01:19:44,780
<i>I should be
punished for that?</i>

1423
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:46,607
- What is he doing?
<i>Am I not the biggest</i>

1424
01:19:46,607 --> 01:19:48,044
<i>victim in this
whole phenomenon?</i>

1425
01:19:48,044 --> 01:19:49,654
Fuck.

1426
01:19:49,654 --> 01:19:52,657
It was completely
insincere and self-serving.

1427
01:19:52,657 --> 01:19:54,877
What?
Which part?

1428
01:19:54,877 --> 01:19:56,443
All of it.

1429
01:19:57,401 --> 01:19:59,142
It's embarrassing, Paul.

1430
01:19:59,142 --> 01:20:01,492
It's embarrassing to be
married to you right now.

1431
01:20:08,194 --> 01:20:09,979
Thanks for letting me stay.

1432
01:20:09,979 --> 01:20:12,198
Yeah.
Uh, just a heads up.

1433
01:20:12,503 --> 01:20:14,505
My wife's not
too hot on the idea,

1434
01:20:14,505 --> 01:20:18,683
<i>so I think it's gonna be in
the basement, if that's okay.</i>

1435
01:20:18,683 --> 01:20:19,989
What's the smell?

1436
01:20:19,989 --> 01:20:21,860
I think that's
the propane tank.

1437
01:20:21,860 --> 01:20:23,688
I'll crack open a window.

1438
01:20:23,688 --> 01:20:26,691
I... I can't just sleep
on the couch upstairs?

1439
01:20:26,691 --> 01:20:28,127
I'm sorry, man.

1440
01:20:29,868 --> 01:20:33,611
If you need anything,
just text me, I'll come down.

1441
01:20:33,611 --> 01:20:35,482
- Thanks.
- Okay.

1442
01:22:06,008 --> 01:22:08,619
Excuse me. Sir.

1443
01:22:08,619 --> 01:22:10,534
I'm seeing my daughter.
She's on stage.

1444
01:22:10,534 --> 01:22:13,015
You're Mr. Matthews, right?

1445
01:22:13,015 --> 01:22:15,408
- No.
- You're not Paul Matthews?

1446
01:22:15,408 --> 01:22:16,975
No.

1447
01:22:19,543 --> 01:22:20,848
Call security.

1448
01:22:36,821 --> 01:22:39,128
You can't be here, Paul.

1449
01:22:39,128 --> 01:22:41,130
Let me just watch,
I'll leave before it's over.

1450
01:22:41,130 --> 01:22:42,958
- I thought we had an agreement.
Come on.

1451
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:44,829
I just want to watch
for a few minutes.

1452
01:22:44,829 --> 01:22:47,005
- Respect our boundaries.
This is ridiculous.

1453
01:22:47,005 --> 01:22:49,181
- Let me in.
- Paul!

1454
01:22:55,971 --> 01:23:00,932
-  Ah!

1455
01:23:05,154 --> 01:23:06,633
He attacked me.

1456
01:23:08,679 --> 01:23:11,290
He... Paul Matthews
attacked me!

1457
01:23:11,290 --> 01:23:13,031
It was an accident.

1458
01:23:13,597 --> 01:23:14,946
She wouldn't let me in.

1459
01:23:15,773 --> 01:23:17,340
I just want to see my daughter.

1460
01:23:19,646 --> 01:23:22,171
She wouldn't let me in.

1461
01:23:22,171 --> 01:23:23,694
It was an accident.

1462
01:23:26,175 --> 01:23:27,828
I just want to see my daughter.

1463
01:23:28,655 --> 01:23:31,310
- Hey, stop.
- No, it was an accident.

1464
01:23:31,310 --> 01:23:34,792
It was an accident.
Sophie, it was an accident.

1465
01:23:34,792 --> 01:23:36,359
- Hold it!

1466
01:23:36,359 --> 01:23:38,404
So... Sophie,
it was an accident.

1467
01:23:39,927 --> 01:23:42,713
Get off me!
Get off of me!

1468
01:23:59,425 --> 01:24:01,123
<i>An average man,</i>

1469
01:24:01,123 --> 01:24:03,429
<i>a cultural sensation,</i>

1470
01:24:03,429 --> 01:24:05,518
<i>a dream turned
into a nightmare.</i>

1471
01:24:05,953 --> 01:24:07,651
<i>For a period,
going to sleep</i>

1472
01:24:07,651 --> 01:24:10,088
<i>meant risking abuse
from this man.</i>

1473
01:24:10,088 --> 01:24:11,916
<i>Though we still
don't understand how</i>

1474
01:24:11,916 --> 01:24:15,093
<i>this phenomenon started
or why it suddenly stopped,</i>

1475
01:24:15,093 --> 01:24:17,530
<i>we can rest assured that
after violently attacking</i>

1476
01:24:17,530 --> 01:24:19,402
<i>a middle school teacher
last fall,</i>

1477
01:24:19,402 --> 01:24:21,752
<i>Paul Matthews disappeared
from the public eye</i>

1478
01:24:21,752 --> 01:24:23,971
<i>and our collective dreams,
all together.</i>

1479
01:24:23,971 --> 01:24:27,323
<i>But through the case of Paul
came one silver lining,</i>

1480
01:24:27,323 --> 01:24:29,977
<i>a revolution
in dream science.</i>

1481
01:24:29,977 --> 01:24:33,938
<i>So now forget the nightmares
and experience a positive way</i>

1482
01:24:33,938 --> 01:24:35,853
<i>of dream travel with Norio.</i>

1483
01:24:35,853 --> 01:24:37,681
- Welcome to the Dream House!

1484
01:24:37,681 --> 01:24:39,683
<i>This is
the Dream House</i>

1485
01:24:39,683 --> 01:24:41,250
<i>on top of
the Hollywood Hills,</i>

1486
01:24:41,250 --> 01:24:43,165
<i>where the next big thing
is happening,</i>

1487
01:24:43,165 --> 01:24:45,254
<i>ads in your dreams.</i>

1488
01:24:45,254 --> 01:24:47,995
"Dreamfluencers,"
or, like, "mindvertisers."

1489
01:24:49,693 --> 01:24:51,477
I don't think there's
like an official title yet.

1490
01:24:51,477 --> 01:24:54,132
Well, I think
social media is over.

1491
01:24:54,132 --> 01:24:58,267
Like if you can promote a song
or a product actually

1492
01:24:58,267 --> 01:25:02,140
in someone's head then that's,
like, way more powerful.

1493
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:04,621
<i>If one man could
enter other people's dreams,</i>

1494
01:25:04,621 --> 01:25:06,188
<i>couldn't any of us?</i>

1495
01:25:06,188 --> 01:25:07,928
<i>One scientist set out
to find a way.</i>

1496
01:25:07,928 --> 01:25:10,322
We had to rethink
the whole field.

1497
01:25:10,322 --> 01:25:14,544
Consciousness is more complex
than we thought.

1498
01:25:14,544 --> 01:25:17,590
Dualism was right.
Jung was right.

1499
01:25:17,590 --> 01:25:20,158
There is a collective subconscious.

1500
01:25:20,158 --> 01:25:24,249
Paul Matthews proved that,
even if accidentally.

1501
01:25:24,249 --> 01:25:28,297
<i>The Norio would definitely
not exist without him.</i>

1502
01:25:28,297 --> 01:25:31,343
<i>Brian Berg
is the inventor of the Norio,</i>

1503
01:25:31,343 --> 01:25:34,999
<i>a device that makes
it possible to dream travel.</i>

1504
01:25:34,999 --> 01:25:38,263
It's like meditation
or hypnagogia.

1505
01:25:38,263 --> 01:25:40,004
<i>Using
neurotechnology,</i>

1506
01:25:40,004 --> 01:25:43,355
<i>the Norio allows you to visit
anyone in their dreams.</i>

1507
01:25:43,355 --> 01:25:45,705
<i>It may look like
he's just resting.</i>

1508
01:25:45,705 --> 01:25:48,143
<i>But right now,
Brian's inside the dream</i>

1509
01:25:48,143 --> 01:25:51,450
<i>of a random 19-year-old boy
in South Korea.</i>

1510
01:25:52,190 --> 01:25:53,365
It's refreshing.

1511
01:25:53,365 --> 01:25:54,932
I feel like
if people are judging it,

1512
01:25:54,932 --> 01:25:56,890
then they don't really
understand it.

1513
01:25:56,890 --> 01:25:58,196
It's not weird.

1514
01:25:58,196 --> 01:26:00,546
It's just like,
we're gonna be in your dream

1515
01:26:00,546 --> 01:26:02,505
for a brief moment.
We're gonna showcase

1516
01:26:02,505 --> 01:26:05,334
some merch or play a hot
new track and say a few things

1517
01:26:05,334 --> 01:26:07,205
and then we're out.
That's it.

1518
01:26:07,205 --> 01:26:08,946
<i>Paul Matthews
left many skeptical</i>

1519
01:26:08,946 --> 01:26:10,382
<i>about dream travel.</i>

1520
01:26:10,382 --> 01:26:12,950
<i>But the Norio has
a no-nightmare guarantee.</i>

1521
01:26:12,950 --> 01:26:14,647
<i>Without enthusiastic consent</i>

1522
01:26:14,647 --> 01:26:16,649
<i>the dream will
simply be terminated.</i>

1523
01:26:16,649 --> 01:26:19,348
I mean, people always
use Paul Matthews as

1524
01:26:19,348 --> 01:26:20,784
the cautionary tale.

1525
01:26:20,784 --> 01:26:24,179
Okay, this industry
might not exist without him.

1526
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:26,659
But also, he put such
a negative stamp on it.

1527
01:26:26,659 --> 01:26:30,272
It's kind of insane that
he harnessed all of this power,

1528
01:26:30,272 --> 01:26:33,013
- just so he could
terrorize people.
Mmm-hmm.

1529
01:26:35,842 --> 01:26:37,061
Okay.

1530
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:42,153
- Ah. Nice.

1531
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:45,852
Okay, girls,
wanna look at the bedrooms

1532
01:26:45,852 --> 01:26:47,202
and see which ones you like?

1533
01:26:48,246 --> 01:26:49,682
I don't like it.

1534
01:26:49,682 --> 01:26:51,162
Go look at the bedrooms, please.

1535
01:27:00,563 --> 01:27:02,913
So, my friend actually
used to have those dreams.

1536
01:27:03,435 --> 01:27:05,916
Or so she claimed, at least.

1537
01:27:05,916 --> 01:27:07,657
Oh. Ha, yeah.

1538
01:27:18,929 --> 01:27:22,672
So, what happened?
Like, they just stopped or...

1539
01:27:22,672 --> 01:27:24,804
I just feel like I haven't
heard of them in a while.

1540
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:26,632
Yeah. I don't know.

1541
01:27:26,632 --> 01:27:29,200
People stopped
having them, I guess.

1542
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:31,550
If I hear anything now,
it's mostly abroad.

1543
01:27:33,073 --> 01:27:34,640
What's the smell?

1544
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:38,557
Oh, I was told that the old
owners were big animal lovers.

1545
01:27:38,557 --> 01:27:40,167
I'm sure
it'll air out in time.

1546
01:27:40,994 --> 01:27:43,562
Um, hey, before you leave,

1547
01:27:43,562 --> 01:27:47,087
have you seen that guy Chris
around the house lately?

1548
01:27:47,871 --> 01:27:50,003
Um, yeah. Yeah.

1549
01:27:50,003 --> 01:27:51,309
Maybe, like,
a week ago, I think.

1550
01:27:51,788 --> 01:27:54,704
- Is he here often?
- I mean, not really.

1551
01:27:55,574 --> 01:27:57,097
Does he stay over?

1552
01:27:57,750 --> 01:27:59,274
I don't think so.

1553
01:28:00,057 --> 01:28:01,798
Hannah, does he stay over?

1554
01:28:01,798 --> 01:28:02,842
I don't know.

1555
01:28:05,497 --> 01:28:07,456
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

1556
01:28:07,456 --> 01:28:09,327
- I love you.
- Love you!

1557
01:28:09,327 --> 01:28:11,634
I'll bring you back
something cool from France.

1558
01:28:11,634 --> 01:28:13,375
Hi.
Hi.

1559
01:28:13,375 --> 01:28:14,898
How was the place?

1560
01:28:14,898 --> 01:28:17,335
Yeah, you know, it was nice.

1561
01:28:17,335 --> 01:28:19,337
- Good location.
- Good.

1562
01:28:19,990 --> 01:28:21,992
I don't think Sophie
really liked it.

1563
01:28:21,992 --> 01:28:26,562
She kept asking, "Why don't you
just move back in with us?"

1564
01:28:26,562 --> 01:28:28,477
Yeah.

1565
01:28:28,477 --> 01:28:30,000
And cost-wise, good?

1566
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,784
You know,
between the settlement

1567
01:28:31,784 --> 01:28:34,700
from Osler and the book deal,
I should be fine.

1568
01:28:35,875 --> 01:28:39,314
- More than fine, actually.
- Okay, great.

1569
01:28:41,011 --> 01:28:44,362
Have you been seeing me in
your dreams lately, by the way?

1570
01:28:45,102 --> 01:28:47,713
No. Why do you
keep asking?

1571
01:28:48,105 --> 01:28:49,498
I'm just curious.

1572
01:28:50,586 --> 01:28:52,718
- Shit, I'm late.
- Where are you going?

1573
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:55,330
Well, I've got a Zoom call
with the publisher.

1574
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:57,462
They're trying
to expand the tour.

1575
01:28:57,462 --> 01:29:00,596
I might be a whole month
now in Paris.

1576
01:29:00,596 --> 01:29:02,467
- It's crazy.
- That's exciting.

1577
01:29:04,339 --> 01:29:08,734
I guess I won't see you
before you leave, then?

1578
01:29:08,734 --> 01:29:11,302
I leave in four days.
I can swing by.

1579
01:29:33,759 --> 01:29:35,761
No, it's fine.
I'll see you when you're back.

1580
01:29:38,547 --> 01:29:40,592
Yeah. Okay.

1581
01:29:44,553 --> 01:29:45,945
Bye.

1582
01:29:47,643 --> 01:29:49,079
Bye, Paul.

1583
01:30:21,938 --> 01:30:24,157
- Hey, Paul.

1584
01:30:24,157 --> 01:30:25,768
I love those on you.

1585
01:30:26,986 --> 01:30:29,424
Hey, come on, try them out.
Dance with me.

1586
01:30:30,468 --> 01:30:32,122
Get out.

1587
01:30:32,122 --> 01:30:34,646
- Get out!
- No, no, try to dance.

1588
01:30:38,781 --> 01:30:40,609
Please don't hit Dylan.

1589
01:30:41,958 --> 01:30:44,439
'Cause your punches will
pack more heat with these

1590
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:48,355
ultra-yummy keto supplements
from Alpha Monster Gains.

1591
01:30:48,355 --> 01:30:50,270
Oh, fuck, let me just
take that again. I'm sorry.

1592
01:30:50,270 --> 01:30:52,359
Your punches will pack
more heat with these

1593
01:30:52,359 --> 01:30:55,362
ultra-yummy keto supplements
from Ultra Yummy...

1594
01:30:55,362 --> 01:30:56,886
- Oh, fuck.
- Wait a minute.

1595
01:30:56,886 --> 01:30:58,496
Where's the...

1596
01:31:22,389 --> 01:31:24,696
So, first up is a magazine
called Rue Morgue.

1597
01:31:24,696 --> 01:31:27,743
They write about myths, cults,
horror movies, stuff like that.

1598
01:31:27,743 --> 01:31:29,484
Did you bring a copy
of the book?

1599
01:31:29,484 --> 01:31:31,224
No, no. It's going straight
to the stores

1600
01:31:31,224 --> 01:31:32,835
and we'll see it there.

1601
01:31:44,368 --> 01:31:46,196
Can you put it on for me?

1602
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:48,067
Uh, I'd rather not.

1603
01:31:51,288 --> 01:31:53,464
No, it's just, I don't want to.

1604
01:31:53,682 --> 01:31:55,292
You don't want to?

1605
01:31:55,292 --> 01:31:58,251
The glove is cool and
I think you should wear it.

1606
01:31:58,251 --> 01:31:59,731
Can I say no?

1607
01:31:59,731 --> 01:32:01,516
Come on. It makes sense.

1608
01:32:01,516 --> 01:32:03,518
You are nightmare guy,
it's totally cool.

1609
01:32:19,055 --> 01:32:20,491
<i>Clear your mind.</i>

1610
01:32:20,491 --> 01:32:22,580
<i>And this is the most
important step.</i>

1611
01:32:22,580 --> 01:32:25,496
<i>Set an intention
for your visitation.</i>

1612
01:32:25,496 --> 01:32:26,802
No, it's still
at the store.

1613
01:32:26,802 --> 01:32:28,630
I think they just changed
the room or something.

1614
01:32:29,544 --> 01:32:31,067
Maybe they needed
a bigger space.

1615
01:32:31,067 --> 01:32:32,590
<i>To successfully enter</i>

1616
01:32:32,590 --> 01:32:36,115
<i>someone's dream is gonna
require a lot of practice.</i>

1617
01:32:36,115 --> 01:32:38,596
<i>Getting the Norio
is just the first step.</i>

1618
01:32:38,596 --> 01:32:40,337
Ah, <i>bonjour,</i> Paul.

1619
01:32:42,295 --> 01:32:44,950
<i>Bonjour.</i>
Wow, big turnout.

1620
01:32:45,690 --> 01:32:48,693
Oh, uh, no,
that is for the other event.

1621
01:32:48,693 --> 01:32:50,390
I... I... I'm so sorry.

1622
01:32:50,390 --> 01:32:51,653
There was a conflict.

1623
01:32:51,653 --> 01:32:53,785
Um, they had to move
you downstairs,

1624
01:32:53,785 --> 01:32:55,961
but come, come, this way.

1625
01:32:59,008 --> 01:33:00,705
Voila.
This is it.

1626
01:33:01,924 --> 01:33:03,926
- Is that the book?
- Hmm.

1627
01:33:04,361 --> 01:33:07,016
I haven't actually seen
a physical copy of it yet.

1628
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:13,283
Okay.

1629
01:33:13,283 --> 01:33:14,850
Wow. It's so thin.

1630
01:33:15,285 --> 01:33:17,766
Must have gotten shorter
in translation.

1631
01:33:20,072 --> 01:33:22,292
They changed the title, too?

1632
01:33:22,292 --> 01:33:23,989
I Am Your Nightmare.

1633
01:33:23,989 --> 01:33:26,644
- That... that is not the title?
- No.

1634
01:33:27,645 --> 01:33:29,734
It was supposed to be
<i>Dream Scenario.</i>

1635
01:33:31,301 --> 01:33:33,999
But this is...
this is fine, I guess.

1636
01:33:35,131 --> 01:33:37,046
Yeah, it's... it's fine.

1637
01:33:37,655 --> 01:33:40,092
It probably works better
for the demographic.

1638
01:33:46,316 --> 01:33:47,970
<i>Who do I make it out to?</i>

1639
01:33:53,671 --> 01:33:55,194

01:33:55,194 --> 01:33:56,935
Shit. Fuck.

1641
01:33:56,935 --> 01:33:59,503

01:33:59,982 --> 01:34:02,071
