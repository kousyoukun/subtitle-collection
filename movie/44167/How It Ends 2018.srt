1
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,466
[woman] Are we having a boy or a girl?

2
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,509
- [doctor] You sure you want to know?
- Yes.

3
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,928
I can't take the suspense.

4
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,185
- Is everything gonna be OK?
- Your baby boy is healthy.

5
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,812
[machine beeping]

6
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:28,940
- Baby boy.
- Baby boy.

7
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,784
You alright?

8
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:40,452
Yeah.

9
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,414
- We got months to get ready.
- Yeah. I'm not worried about that.

10
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,625
Good. Then you shouldn't worry
about tonight either.

11
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,294
Right. 'Cause asking Tom Sutherland
for his daughter's hand

12
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:52,339
- is gonna be a walk in the park.
- Would you rather tell him I'm pregnant?

13
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,675
- Funny.
- It's gonna be alright.

14
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,260
Yeah. At least we'll have something
to talk about this time.

15
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,804
Just go easy on Dad.

16
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:02,641
Nothing to be afraid of.
Just don't bring up the boat.

17
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,267
I try not to bring up the boat,

18
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,812
but then I get nervous
and I end up bringing up the boat.

19
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:10,649
- He restored it himself, Will.
- Yeah, I am aware of that little detail.

20
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:22,994
I love you.

21
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:24,913
I love you, too.

22
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,332
- Good luck tonight.
- Thank you.

23
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,376
- You're gonna need it.
- I know.

24
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,462
- OK, I'll call you from the airport. Bye.
- Yeah.

25
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,526
OK, I think it's gonna be easy enough
to get things going between us.

26
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,570
- So, Tuesday? The same?
- Yeah.

27
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:57,738
OK, see you.

28
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:19,092
Hey, there. Mr. and Mrs. Sutherland.

29
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,028
- Hi. Good to see you.
- Hi. Good to see you, too.

30
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,489
Tom, honey? Will's here.

31
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:46,912
Hi, Tom.

32
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:48,747
Will.

33
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,666
- Good to see you.
- Yeah, you, too.

34
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:55,253
I was just about to fix myself
another drink.

35
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:59,382
Why don't you see if Paula
can use a little hand in the kitchen?

36
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,429
Yeah, sure.

37
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:10,143
- Anything I can do to help?
- Oh, no. You're our guest.

38
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:11,728
Relax.

39
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:13,605
Go talk to Tom.

40
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,106
Yeah.

41
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,112
Here you go.

42
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,572
Thank you.

43
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,158
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

44
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,415
- Why don't you have a seat?
- Thank you.

45
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,183
How we looking at time, hon?

46
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:53,478
Not too long. Enjoy your scotch.

47
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,734
Key West. Three years ago.

48
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:02,737
I think it was five, actually.

49
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,073
Sam has the same photo in our loft.

50
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,409
Right.

51
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,370
You came with us.
How could I forget that?

52
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,169
That's... Wow!

53
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:19,713
The boat.

54
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,841
I remember this.

55
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,136
Took me almost as long to make that one
as it did the original.

56
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:33,310
Why don't you put her back down, Will?
Let's just stay on the safe side. Alright?

57
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,227
Yeah, of course.

58
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,858
Sam mentioned that the two of you
are thinking about

59
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,611
- finding a house.
- We're talking about it, yeah.

60
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:45,906
You know, at some point in the future
it'd be nice to have some more room.

61
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:48,450
- Here you go.
- I am of two minds about it, you know?

62
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:51,620
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

63
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,415
- What are you of two minds about?
- Providing assistance.

64
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,460
I need a guarantee
that if it doesn't work out,

65
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:02,631
you can't make any claims to the money
that I put down. Nothing personal, Will.

66
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:06,051
Sorry, I'm a little confused.
Did Sam ask you for help?

67
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:10,138
No, don't worry about any of that, Will.
We've helped her brother, Steven, too.

68
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,057
Right.

69
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:15,769
You know that I'm making good money
on this job, right?

70
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,813
If memory serves, you were unemployed
before you moved to Seattle. Sam had to

71
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,608
- support both of you for a while there.
- No, Sam didn't have to...

72
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,322
You know, like I said, work's good.

73
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,323
And...

74
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,201
you know, when it makes sense,
when...

75
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:34,537
when it's the right time,
then I'll open my own practice. But...

76
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,707
Well, in the meantime, we're fine.

77
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,460
- That's great.
- Doesn't sound like much of a plan, Will.

78
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:42,963
Tom.

79
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,131
Give it a rest.

80
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,385
Everyone wants the dream.

81
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,180
Problem with your generation is
that nobody wants to work for it.

82
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:56,267
I spent 27 years
serving our country.

83
00:07:57,352 --> 00:08:00,772
I saved and I saved
until I started working for Northbridge,

84
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,525
where I started making
some real money. But...

85
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,694
I always had a plan.

86
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,656
You know, I have never asked anyone
for any help.

87
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,783
And you're not asking for anything now.

88
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,411
We're just offering to help our daughter.

89
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,579
Why did you move to Seattle?

90
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:18,540
OK, that's enough.

91
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:20,667
Honey.

92
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,086
I'm only asking because...

93
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,131
I suspect that Will moved

94
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,591
because he thought it would be easier.

95
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,678
Because he thought it would be more secure

96
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,139
if he moved my daughter away from me.

97
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:38,059
- Moving was Sam's idea.
- Come on. It's...

98
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,104
You know what, I doubt that.
Sam would have told me that.

99
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:42,689
Oh, yeah?

100
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,152
You think she would have told you
that she wanted to move away

101
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:50,071
to start her life
on her own terms with me,

102
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,657
without her father breathing down
her fucking neck all the time?

103
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:56,077
Say what you've gotta say, spit it out.
Let us know how you really feel, Will.

104
00:08:58,413 --> 00:08:59,247
Sorry.

105
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,625
Get it off your chest,
but just don't swear in front of my wife.

106
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,672
Whose table do you think
you're sitting at?

107
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,594
Will...

108
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,930
Sweetheart, it's getting late.
Let me walk you out.

109
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:19,851
Come on.

110
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,524
[planes flying in distance]

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,914

<i>Am I your wake-up call?</i>

113
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,669
No, no, I was just...

114
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,798
I was just lying down after the gym.

115
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,301
<i>Yeah, I don't think so.
You look like shit.</i>

116
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,679
<i>What time is your flight?</i>

117
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,974
Soon. What time is it?

118
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:02,769
<i>Six in the morning.</i>

119
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,773
<i>- In Seattle.</i>
- Fuck, fuck.

120
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,275
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

121
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,152
<i>So, my mother just called.</i>

122
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,823
Oh, that's... that's great.

123
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,908
Wait, wait. What did she say?

124
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,327
<i>What do you think she said?</i>

125
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:24,874
Yeah, OK. I'm sorry, alright?
I'm sorry, but, Sam, look,

126
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,045
he was into me from the second
I got in, OK? I guarantee you

127
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:32,674
if I'd asked for his blessing last night,
he would have said no. So I didn't.

128
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:35,468
<i>- My mother asked you to leave.</i>
- No, no, she didn't.

129
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:39,013
It wasn't quite like that.
She didn't ask me to leave.

130
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:40,390
<i>Just call her.</i>

131
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:43,768
I'm really, really fucking late, OK?
I gotta go.

132
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:46,271

<i>I want to stress this is all preliminary.</i>

158
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:35,296
<i>We are reporting this
just as we are learning it.</i>

159
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:39,175
<i>We do not yet have any information
on damages or casualties.</i>

160
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:40,718
<i>The Southern California...</i>

161
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,555
[beeping]

162
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,334
Hey, man, are you free?

163
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,259
Two hundred bucks. Back to the city.

164
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:28,266
[mutters] Fuck.

165
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,270
Shit. Fuck.

166
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,697
Sam, it's me. Call me.

167
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,200
Hey, it's me again. Call me
as soon as you get this, alright?

168
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:12,935
- Will. Thanks, Mark.
- Thanks.

169
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,899
Are you OK? Will's here.

170
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,860
I guess that answers that question.

171
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,946
We thought that there was a chance
that you flew back.

172
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:28,076
They shut down O'Hare.
I didn't know where else to go.

173
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,828
Well, have you talked to Sam?
I haven't been able to reach her.

174
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:33,831
Yeah. I was on the phone to her
when it happened.

175
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,625
I heard something, so did she.

176
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,544
- What did you hear?
- I don't know. It was like a...

177
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:42,465
Like a loud rumble or something.
I didn't know what it was. And then...

178
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:43,841
we got disconnected.

179
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,803
- What's the last thing she said?
- She said something's wrong.

180
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,138
But she sounded scared.

181
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,893
Alright, I'm gonna go pack up the rest
of my things. Yours are on the table.

182
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,617
- I should head back to the airport.
- I thought you said they shut it down.

183
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,662
Yeah, but once the power comes back on,
there'll be flights, right?

184
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,956
Let's look at what we know, Will.

185
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,917
There was an event,
a couple of hours ago, out west.

186
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,796
The power shut off here,
two thousand miles away.

187
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:25,967
We have no idea what's happening,
yet we've got F-22s doing flybys.

188
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:29,929
This moment is not about waiting
for the power to come back on.

189
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,850
The only thing that we can control
is what we decide to do.

190
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,602
So, what? What are you saying?
What are you gonna do?

191
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:37,603
Get on the road.

192
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,565
What, you're gonna drive to Seattle?

193
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,693
Paula can stay at Steven's.

194
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,154
They'll be fine there.

195
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:48,698
But my only daughter...

196
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:50,408
she's alone.

197
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,412
I only have one question for you.

198
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,540
Are you coming with me?

199
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,639
- Don't stop for anyone.
- Got it.

200
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,476
Steven's prepared for everything.

201
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,394
- OK.
- You'll be safe there.

202
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,981
- I love you. Be safe.
- You'll be alright.

203
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,566
You, too.

204
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:25,860
- Bye.
- Let's go.

205
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,657
How can cell service still be out?

206
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,244
GPS is out, too.

207
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,953
- You got money?
- Yeah.

208
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,038
Fill her up with gas,
I'll go get supplies.

209
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,043
- Hey, man you got cash?
- Yeah.

210
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,005
- Cash only, right? Thanks.
- Thanks.

211
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,780
Nice car, cutie.

212
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:38,409
Wanna show me the back seat?

213
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,620
Yeah, I don't think so.

214
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,371
Excuse me?

215
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,541
What'd you say?

216
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,085
- What are you talking about?
- What's going on, Liza?

217
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,922
- This piece of shit just called me a slut.
- What? Whoa, no, no.

218
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:55,009
Hey, I didn't call you a slut.

219
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,886
I think this is gonna
fucking cost you, man.

220
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,096
- OK, OK.
- Hey! Don't do that.

221
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,891
- That's my car.
- Shut the fuck up, old man!

222
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:05,436
Hey, pops.

223
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:08,689
- Come on, I know you got some cash.
- All right.

224
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,318
The money's in my luggage.

225
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:16,030
Don't look at Liza.

226
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,283
What are you looking at?

227
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:20,951
Whoa, whoa!

228
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:23,621
- Jesus Christ, Tom.
- Get back in the car, Will.

229
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,456
Start running and don't look back!

230
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,334
Punk.

231
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,449
Is there something you want to say?

232
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,037
You should've told me.

233
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:09,208
- Told you what?
- Told me that you had a gun.

234
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,586
And what would you have said, Will?

235
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,673
I'm assuming that you've never fired
a firearm before.

236
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:20,052
No, I haven't used a firearm, but it's not
exactly a priority in my law firm, is it?

237
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:25,391
You know what, Will,
what if they had taken this car?

238
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,520
Game over. It would be game over!

239
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,749
[soldier]
<i>Interstate 90 westbound is closed.</i>

240
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:55,254
<i>Well, something must be going on
if they're not letting us through.</i>

241
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:59,008
- Is there another way?
- No. We need this road.

242
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,385
<i>Interstate 90 is closed.</i>

243
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:02,970
<i>Stop, hold it there.</i>

244
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,724
Sir, the road's closed ahead.
Follow the other cars. Thank you.

245
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,185
I'm sorry, Sergeant. But we got
a lot of miles in front of us,

246
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,562
and you're shutting down
the biggest highway in the country.

247
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,898
Public safety issue, sir.
On account of the power outage.

248
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,275
No help for you out there
if you have a flat or an accident.

249
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:18,944
Let's get this traffic moving.

250
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,697
- What are you doing?
- Can I just have a word, Sergeant?

251
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,825
I understand you got a job to do.

252
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:27,620
And I know you got orders.
I've been there.

253
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,539
I spent the better part of my adult life
in the Marine Corps.

254
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:32,500
Sir.

255
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,668
We'd be on our own, I understand.

256
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,129
But my daughter's a long ways
in that direction.

257
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,799
I'm asking, can you help me?

258
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,805
Yeah. Get in the car.

259
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:52,812
Let the Caddy through!
Local traffic, lives past the next exit.

260
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,856
- Thank you, Sergeant.
- Good luck, sir.

261
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:58,150
Well done.

262
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,026
Apparently, we're not the only ones
heading west.

263
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:44,989
The F-22s, the road block.
What is this?

264
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:46,490
It's not good.

265
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:48,450
Yeah.

266
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:42,838
Jesus Christ.
I didn't even see him coming.

267
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:54,850
I have no reception.

268
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,645
He probably can't run our plates.

269
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:02,650
I'm gonna check it out, OK?

270
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:03,943
Careful.

271
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:06,445
Officer?

272
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,241
He's not a cop.

273
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,953
<i>- Is there a problem, Officer?
- Get back in the car!</i>

274
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,704
Will! Get back in the car!

275
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,623
Tell your friend to get out
of the fucking car!

276
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,668
- OK. Fuck.
- Tell him to get out of the fucking car!

277
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,093
Will, let's go! Go, go, go!

278
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,391
Who the fuck was that?

279
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:37,977
Fuck. Get the ammo for the SIG
in the trunk!

280
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,729
- What? It wasn't loaded before?
- I didn't need it to be.

281
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,611
Will, just get the ammo out of the go bag.

282
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:49,738
You see the black bag? Little black bag?

283
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:52,324
- Yeah, I got it. He's coming!
- Take it out.

284
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,284
Put the mag into the weapon.

285
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:02,626
- How do I do it?
- Put the mag in the gun.

286
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:09,049
Hit the button on the side.
Shoot. You gotta do it. Shoot.

287
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,222
Shoot! Shoot, shoot!

288
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:18,267
- Fuck, it's not working! What do I do?
- Pull it back! Put it in the chamber!

289
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,811
Put the bullet in the chamber.
Pull the top back.

290
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,397
- See if you have a cartridge inside.
- Fuck!

291
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,318
Come on!

292
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,529
Come on! Come on!

293
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:32,573
Fuck you!

294
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:35,617
Come on! Fuck!

295
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,161
Hold on.

296
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,625
Fuck.

297
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:50,424
All right, OK. OK.

298
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:51,884
Fuck.

299
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,445
- Shit!
- Hold on!

300
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:44,603
Tom.

301
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,658
Ah, fuck.

302
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,497
Get out of the car, faggot. Now.

303
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:15,467
You OK?

304
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:31,942
You all right?

305
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,237
I think I broke my ribs.

306
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,031
We're gonna need to find a garage.

307
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:56,318
Hey.

308
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,028
Do you work here?

309
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,366
We were...
We've been in an accident.

310
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,410
Yeah?

311
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,496
Where' s the trooper?

312
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:09,081
It was abandoned.

313
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,214
- You guys even know where you are?
- No.

314
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,928
- We were hoping for your help.
- You guys got money?

315
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,847
- I ain't doing shit for free.
- Nor should you.

316
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,017
I can take a look.

317
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,812
If you need new parts, I can't help you.

318
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:34,856
- Understood.
- Restroom's all the way in the back.

319
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:52,040
Hey! I told you not to fuck with them!

320
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,419
Who the fuck do you think you are?

321
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,045
Leave me alone!

322
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,387
[man] <i>So, all cell service goes out.</i>

323
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:09,683
<i>Virtually all communications, except local
ham radio like us or short wave.</i>

324
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:14,938
<i>But how does that happen, huh?
US Government goes virtually silent?</i>

325
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:19,693
<i>Are we talking World War Three?
Like a nuke attack that went sideways?</i>

326
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:22,279
<i>I mean, the damned president's doing
a massive cover-up.</i>

327
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,908
<i>Military coup? Martial law?
We don't know, we don't know.</i>

328
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:30,203
<i>If anyone out there who knows anything,
get on short wave. Please, do it now.</i>

329
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:31,997
[woman] <i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>

330
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,624
<i>- Is anyone out there?</i>
- [man] <i>Two thousand satellites in space,</i>

331
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,460
<i>- all of them down?</i>
- [woman] <i>Answer me, I...</i>

332
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,962
[man] <i>Government knows, man.
They're just keeping it from us.</i>

333
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:40,589
[woman] <i>Is there anyone...</i>

334
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,801
<i>I need help! Mayday!</i>

335
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:48,388
<i>Mayday! Is anyone out there?</i>

336
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:36,019
I sealed the radiator. It should hold.

337
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,438
- You can keep driving for a while.
- A while?

338
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:40,649
What if it breaks?

339
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:44,361
Radiator isn't gonna break.
Might start leaking again, though.

340
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:47,406
I can give you some of the sealant,
show you how to use it.

341
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:48,907
OK.

342
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:52,953
I'll gave you $200 for the labor.

343
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:56,206
And if we get to where we're going,
I'll mail you another two.

344
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:59,918
Yeah. How about you give me
that other two right now?

345
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:02,712
Hey.

346
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,091
Is that your Buick out there?

347
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:07,592
Yeah.

348
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:09,803
- Does it run?
- Why?

349
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:11,805
Wanna sell it?

350
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,727
No, I was gonna head out to California
and get the fuck out of this place.

351
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:22,107
But now all she needs is a new
transmission, so she ain't for sale.

352
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,359
Then maybe you should come with us.

353
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,614
- I don't think so.
- We're going out west.

354
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:33,201
Yeah? Why would I want to go with you?

355
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,622
'Cause I'll give you $1,000.

356
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:44,463
You can keep the cash
and be almost all the way to California.

357
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:46,923
If you have any problems or a break down,
you can fix it.

358
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:48,800
Look.

359
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:52,804
No disrespect, but I ain't about
doing no road trip right now

360
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:55,265
with two shady dudes
that appear out of nowhere.

361
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,392
Whoa, whoa.
We're not shady, come on.

362
00:32:57,476 --> 00:33:02,189
You two roll up in a fucked-up,
shot up cop car that you say you found,

363
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:04,524
towing a shot up Caddy, and...

364
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,486
You know, you got blood
all over your face. So, yeah.

365
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:08,945
Shady as fuck.

366
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,781
I hear you loud and clear.
Doesn't look good.

367
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,034
Doesn't look good.

368
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:17,913
I could tell you that it wasn't us.

369
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:19,748
That...

370
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:22,918
we were you just defending ourselves.
I could tell you

371
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:26,421
actually what happened,
down to the very last detail, but...

372
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:29,299
if I were you,
I'm not sure I would believe that either.

373
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:33,136
But I can tell you this.

374
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:37,807
With a clear conscience,
I can look you in the eye and I can say...

375
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:43,188
there's a lot to be afraid of out there.

376
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:46,233
A lot of real danger.

377
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:50,237
None of us know how much.

378
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:52,989
But...

379
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:54,908
me...

380
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:56,910
him...

381
00:33:58,912 --> 00:33:59,746
we're not it.

382
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,374
I'm Tom.

383
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:04,167
This is Will.

384
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:12,217
We're just driving out west
to see if we can find my daughter.

385
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,434
All right.

386
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:23,520
I've heard enough.

387
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:26,398
So, you'll help us?

388
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:32,320
Did I say that?

389
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:42,455
I'm going to the car.

390
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:47,377
I'll do it for two thousand.

391
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:52,882
OK. Great.

392
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:04,686
Got the essentials.

393
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,064
As long as we don't snap an axle,
I can get us to Seattle.

394
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:09,024
Great.

395
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:12,402
Oh, and I siphoned the cop's gas.

396
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:19,951
- What are you doing?
- I want us to be invisible from behind.

397
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:25,123
- Here you go, Will. Drive the first shift.
- OK.

398
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,460
You ride in the back.

399
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,963
Course Tonto rides in the fucking back.

400
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:37,469
Chill. Whoa, I was kidding.

401
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:42,849
What's he doing?

402
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:45,435
Better not fucking come back.

403
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:46,686
Take it easy, man!

404
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:47,854
Just drive.

405
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,256
So, you guys got a radio signal?

406
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,008
Not here.

407
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,977
Is there a frontage road to the 90?
Another way west?

408
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:32,732
Take a left here.
Can head out on the 14 West for a while.

409
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:36,277
All right. OK.

410
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,866
What kinda music you guys into?

411
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:44,494
Yeah, I don't think
it's that kind of road trip, Ricki.

412
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,056
There's someone behind us.

413
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,142
Pull over.

414
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:09,269
Lights off.

415
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:31,666
Catch up.

416
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,710
- Use their taillights to guide us.
- OK.

417
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:53,897
Want some?

418
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:55,607
No. No, thanks.

419
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,028
Think he's asleep.

420
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,156
Yeah, let him. He's gonna want to drive
when he wakes up.

421
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,492
Then I'll get some sleep.

422
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,622
So, his daughter... that's your girl?

423
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:13,333
Yeah.

424
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:14,876
Yeah, she is.

425
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:24,803
Whoa.

426
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:26,846
Check it out.

427
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,142
It's crazy.

428
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,480
- They on our side of the road?
- Jesus!

429
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:40,193
Oh, my God!

430
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:48,076
Fuck.

431
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,464
Survivors?

432
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,424
No.

433
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:09,722
Fuck, Jesus Christ.

434
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,017
She's dead.

435
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:16,813
What's he saying?

436
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:20,650
- I think it's a telephone number.
- Will, let him be.

437
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,152
We can't just leave him!

438
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,531
We're hours from a hospital,
and this guy, he's not gonna make it.

439
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:29,701
Let's get back in the car.
Let's go, guys. Let's go. Let's go.

440
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:32,495
Will?

441
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,831
Let's go. Ricki!

442
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,379
Leave them. Ricki, come on!

443
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:53,558
Shit. Shit, shit, shit.

444
00:39:58,354 --> 00:39:59,397
What's he doing?

445
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:10,783
Fuck!

446
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:11,993
Let's go.

447
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:20,585
You gotta stop the car for Ricki.
Stop the car, Tom. Stop the fucking car!

448
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:23,838
Let's go! Come on!

449
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,423
Go, go!

450
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:40,229
If Will hadn't told me to wait,
I would've left you.

451
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:42,565
Whatever.

452
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:45,860
See if I fix your car
if it breaks down again.

453
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,030
What the fuck?

454
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:52,784
We had a deal. If you're not gonna
honor it, you need to speak up now.

455
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,207
All right, then.

456
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:28,486
You OK?

457
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:30,405
Whatever.

458
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:32,281
Yeah, he can be pretty hard.

459
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:35,618
Think that's hard?

460
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:39,622
You don't know what hard is, man.

461
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:45,086
Yeah, maybe not.

462
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,339
So, why California, huh?

463
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,883
I'm gonna become a rapper.

464
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:52,969
Come on, seriously?

465
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:55,638
What? You don't think that I got it?

466
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:57,140
No, no.

467
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:02,520
No, of course I do. I just, you know,
I thought it was a pretty odd career path.

468
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,480
Totally fucking with you.

469
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:08,526
Nice.

470
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,325
You ever seen clouds like that before?

471
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,040
Hell, no.

472
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,378
Something's coming.

473
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:32,842
- Go, go! Get in the car!
- Get in!

474
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:51,152
What the fuck is this?

475
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:04,207
Holy shit.

476
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,594
You see the bridge? Do you see it?

477
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:22,600
What the fuck is going on?

478
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:39,659
- Never seen a storm like this.
- This is crazy.

479
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:06,686
Think that was lightning?

480
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:16,112
- Turn it up.
- OK.

484
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:29,917
At least not here.

485
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:40,887
You're gonna want to stay on the 17.

486
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:44,473
I have friends in Ashland Heights.
I already checked.

487
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,934
We can stop there. We can resupply.

488
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,479
We can resupply anywhere.
We don't wanna go out of our way.

489
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:52,565
Look, why don't we just stop, OK?

490
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:55,610
Ricki can check the car
and my friends can help us.

491
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,280
- You just drive. I got the plans.
- I said they're friends, Tom.

492
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,532
They're not just my friends,
they're Sam's friends.

They're gonna wanna help us.

Whoa, whoa.

495
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:31,520
Hey.

496
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:34,232
Something's wrong with the car.

497
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,368
No services here. No gas, no nothing.

498
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:49,497
We've been on the road for a long time.
A good friend of mine lives in the town.

499
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:54,335
Every car that stops here says
they got friends in this little town.

500
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:59,173
His name's Adam Dumont.
He was born and raised here.

501
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:01,926
I was a groomsman at his wedding.

502
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:05,972
My girlfriend and I have been here,
like, half a dozen times.

503
00:46:07,348 --> 00:46:09,141
His wife, Meg,

504
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:13,771
she owns a pottery store in town.
I can't remember what the name of it is.

505
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:16,983
We just wanna get off the road for
a couple of hours and then we'll be gone.

506
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:24,407
- Harris!
- Yes, sir?

507
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:26,617
Find an escort for these boys
over to the Dumonts'.

508
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:30,288
And make sure, they get turned away,
they come straight back here.

509
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:31,789
OK, let them through.

510
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,874
- Good job.
- Let them through.

511
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,167
Just let them through.

512

What are you doing here?

519
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:30,723
How did you even get here?

Hey.

521
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:38,356
This is Tom, Sam's dad.
And Ricki in the back.

522
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:41,359
Hey. We should all go inside.

523
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:42,568
- It's a lot cooler.
- Yeah.

524
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:47,114
I'm gonna take a couple of minutes
to check out the car and get organized.

525
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:50,368
- Where's... Where's Sam?
- I'll explain inside.

When was last time you heard from Adam?

530
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:06,217
It must've been...

531
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:10,596
I guess the night before it all, so...

532
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:17,478
He's... He's on a business trip
to San Francisco.

533
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,526
Well, if anyone's gonna be OK, it's Adam.

534
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:31,075
I mean, none of this makes any sense.
It's just that...

535
00:48:32,785 --> 00:48:36,872
These fucking storms and then this heat.
And we've been having earthquakes.

536
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,546
It's just... I mean, it's so crazy
that you're here and...

537
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,841
- It's gonna be OK, Meg.
- Yeah.

it can't stay like this forever.

540
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,395
Really? Do you really think that?

541
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:07,486
- Sorry. I haven't been sleeping and it...
- No, it's fine, It's OK.

542
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:14,535

We still have plenty of water.

Doesn't that tell you something, Will?
If they were all right, we would know.

I just...
None of this is real. It can't be real.

And he's coming back for you. I know that.

And what if he isn't?

Because...

557
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:44,250
Because I can feel it, Will.

558
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:47,002
I can feel that he's gone.

559

- I can feel it in my bones. I know it.
- No, no, no. Just...

And I know that Sam is gone, Will.
She's gone!

down there.

00:53:10,479 --> 00:53:12,314
Oh, hell, yeah.

Holy shit! Holy fuck! It's hot in there!

Cheyenne, Chinook, Chickasaw, Apache.

589

I just think it's funny that the Army

590
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:12,458
named its helicopters after tribes
they tried to wipe out.

591

Want you to grab the cans,
check out the cars,

look at the generators, whatever you find.
We're gonna go check out the diner.

- I already found some.

but still had gas in the back.

Whoa, whoa. I got it.

602
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:26,490
I got it. You OK?

603
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:27,950
Fine.

604

- What's going on?
- He broke some ribs.

your phone. Tom, check your phone now.

- Jesus. We should turn around.
- This road's the only way over the pass.

Oh, shit!

- I just want to see what's going on.

00:58:29,131 --> 00:58:31,008
- No, no.
- OK, OK.

630
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:34,094
You just need to get in the car.
It's safer in the car. Come on, come on.

631
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:37,347
- I just need help.
- Where's your spare? Is it in the car?

632
00:58:37,431 --> 00:58:39,057
I don't know. I don't know.

633
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:41,226
- All right. Come on, Ricki.
- I can't.

634
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:44,813
I can't. I don't know how.
I need help.

635
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:47,524
Yeah. It's right here.

636
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:49,276
Help me.

637
00:58:51,737 --> 00:58:53,155
- Should be right here.
- Right.

638
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:54,114
Hey, hands up!

639
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:56,533
Whoa, whoa!

640
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:58,201
We just want the gas.

641
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:01,163
- You happy? You happy now?
- Go get it.

642
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:02,289
Shut the fuck up!

643
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,291
- What the fuck is he doing?
- It's not personal.

644
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:06,626
- We all got places to be.
- Stay calm.

645
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:08,920
Stay calm, all right? Stay calm.

646
00:59:09,004 --> 00:59:10,672
- Hurry up, now.
- It's locked.

647
00:59:10,756 --> 00:59:12,674
- Open it.
- It's locked and I don't have the key.

648
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:15,844
- You got anything?
- Bingo!

649
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:18,096
- No!
- Hey!

650
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:29,191
Don't. Don't fucking do it, man.

651
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:31,902
Fill it. Fill it!

652
00:59:32,736 --> 00:59:35,655
- Just leave us one canister, please.
- Shut your fucking mouth.

653
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:38,033
- Jesus Christ!
- Tom, you all right?

654
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:41,119
Tom! You OK?

655
00:59:41,203 --> 00:59:43,371
Get the gas.
Let's get the hell out of here.

656
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:46,041
Just get the gas. Let's fucking go, man.

657
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:48,126
- Leave us one can, man. Please.
- Hurry!

658
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:50,545
Don't leave us here to die.

659
00:59:50,629 --> 00:59:52,923
- Let's fucking go.
- You're killing us. Don't take the gas!

660
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:55,967
Jesus Christ. You OK?

661
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:59,429
- My ribs. Couldn't lift my gun.
- Fuck!

662
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:01,223
- Fuck!
- Shame on you.

663
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:03,308
- All of you.
- You fucking helped them!

664
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:07,104
- All right. Come on, get in the car.
- Why'd you stop?

665
01:00:07,187 --> 01:00:10,315
- We're supposed to be decent.
- Get in the car. We have to go right now!

666
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:14,861
I'm staying with him. I'm not leaving
my husband like this. Not with you people!

667
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:17,280
We gotta go. If we don't catch them,
we're dead. Come on, go.

668
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:23,370
- Come on, get in the car!
- Let's go, Will. Can't lose them.

669
01:00:34,673 --> 01:00:35,882
They can't be far.

670
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,561
Come on! Come on, damn it.

671
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:06,329
Fuck!

672
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:08,123
Hold on!

673
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:11,001
Holy fuck.

674
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:18,675
Hold on!

675
01:01:21,428 --> 01:01:22,554
Come on!

676
01:01:25,891 --> 01:01:28,059
- Will...
- Holy fuck!

677
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:32,105
- You know how to use this?
- Yeah.

678
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:33,190
Take it.

679
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:37,319
Make it count!

680
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:40,488
Shoot!

681
01:01:41,907 --> 01:01:43,825
Hold on! Here we go.

682
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:45,702
Shoot!

683
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:47,454
Shoot, Ricki!

684
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:48,663
Shoot!

685
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:49,915
Shoot!

686
01:01:50,624 --> 01:01:51,583
Do it!

687
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:53,543
Shoot the tire! Shoot.

688
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:55,587
You got it.

689
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:58,381
You go it. Shoot the tire, Ricki!

690
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:17,609
Get the gas!

691
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:20,695
I'll get them.

692
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:25,450
- Get it!
- No.

693
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:27,494
I can't!

694
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:30,747
Get off!

695
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,877
- I can't open it!
- Let go of me!

696
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:38,588
- Come on, Ricki. Come on. Damn it!
- I can't! He's holding it.

697
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:40,131
- Come on!
- Let go!

698
01:02:40,215 --> 01:02:41,925
We're running out of time.
Go, go. Come on!

699
01:02:43,802 --> 01:02:45,220
Come on. Let's go.

700
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:46,429
Let's go. Come on!

701
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:47,973
Go, go, go.

702
01:03:30,724 --> 01:03:31,766
Pull over.

703
01:03:33,435 --> 01:03:35,895
- I can't pull over here, Ricki.
- I said pull over.

704
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:37,856
- I said pull over!
- OK, OK.

705
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:51,328
Fuck!

706
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:54,122
I fucking killed them!

707
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:56,124
They robbed us, Ricki.
They were gonna kill us.

708
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:58,376
You saved us. That's the truth.

709
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:01,463
- You did a good thing.
- Yeah? For what?

710
01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:04,215
So I can do this all over again?

711
01:04:04,299 --> 01:04:07,302
It's another fucking
thousand miles to Seattle.

712
01:04:07,385 --> 01:04:10,388
- It's OK. It's OK.
- I'm not gonna shoot you!

713
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:14,559
I shouldn't have fucking come.

714
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:18,897
I'd rather go back to the fucking rez
than spend another minute here with you.

715
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:20,774
We're in the middle of fucking nowhere.

716
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:22,942
You think that I wouldn't make it?

717
01:04:24,152 --> 01:04:27,864
Who do you think's been taking care of me
since the day that I was born?

718
01:04:34,913 --> 01:04:36,706
We'll survive this longer than you.

719
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:39,501
Fuck!

720
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:43,213
- Fuck both you guys.
- Ricki, OK, let's just take a...

721
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:46,257
We're gonna take a second, all right?
And we're gonna rest here.

722
01:04:58,186 --> 01:04:59,020
Ricki?

723
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:01,815
You saved us. Remember that.

724
01:05:02,524 --> 01:05:03,858
I am...

725
01:05:17,831 --> 01:05:19,249
Let's just give her a minute.

726
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:58,204
Ricki?

727
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:13,595
Ricki!

728
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:26,191
Tom.

729
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:27,567
Wake up.

730
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:30,904
Ricki's gone. She left.

731
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:33,615
What?

732
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:35,033
She took her stuff.

733
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:37,368
- You sure?
- Yeah.

734
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:39,037
Maybe she'll be safer.

735
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:45,877
Should never have asked her
to come with us.

736
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:27,669
- Up ahead.
- Yeah.

737
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:28,962
There.

738
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:30,838
Goddamn.

739
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:36,302
Jesus.

740
01:07:40,515 --> 01:07:41,766
Let's just check for gas.

741
01:08:56,257 --> 01:08:58,051
- What's going on, Tom?
- I can't breathe.

742
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:01,679
- All right. Let's get some help right now.
- No time. My lungs are collapsing.

743
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:04,349
- Gotta let the pressure out.
- OK. How, how would...

744
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:07,060
- What you want me to do?
- Put it in.

745
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:08,728
- Where?
- Put it...

746
01:09:09,187 --> 01:09:10,438
- Put in it.
- OK, OK.

747
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,565
- OK.
- All the way in.

748
01:09:22,617 --> 01:09:23,451
OK.

749
01:09:24,369 --> 01:09:25,244
OK.

750
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:11,791
Sam told me that...

751
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:17,088
your father left you.
That's ugly.

752
01:10:19,132 --> 01:10:20,758
And you were just a kid, right?

753
01:10:23,428 --> 01:10:24,429
Yeah.

754
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:26,431
Yeah.

755
01:10:27,515 --> 01:10:28,725
And your old man...

756
01:10:30,852 --> 01:10:33,312
he's... he's all right, right?

757
01:10:35,148 --> 01:10:38,943
I guess. He lives in Idaho now
with his new family. I see him...

758
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:41,529
once every couple years.

759
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:46,492
It's a shame that you never
got to meet my father.

760
01:10:50,705 --> 01:10:53,082
Sam must have told you
some stories about him.

761
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:54,834
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

762
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:56,794
You know,

763
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,005
if you think I'm bad,

764
01:11:00,131 --> 01:11:00,965
then...

765
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:03,176
forget it.

766
01:11:05,762 --> 01:11:08,473
He had this... had this look,

767
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:10,767
when he thought you crossed the line.

768
01:11:12,727 --> 01:11:14,729
He'd just stare at you.

769
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:19,859
It wasn't in disappointment, you know?

770
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:22,612
No. It was...

771
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:27,950
'cause he was disgusted at the fact
that he brought you into the world.

772
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,168
He was a shitty father.

773
01:11:41,005 --> 01:11:43,007
I mean, in his heart, he was a good man.

774
01:11:49,472 --> 01:11:51,182
I don't know if I'm a good father.

775
01:11:53,226 --> 01:11:54,101
I try.

776
01:11:58,272 --> 01:11:59,774
You know I love your daughter.

777
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:02,693
Yeah.

778
01:12:05,363 --> 01:12:06,197
I know.

779
01:12:07,615 --> 01:12:09,534
I know you do, yeah.

780
01:12:10,701 --> 01:12:13,579
If I didn't think that,
I would have killed you a long time ago.

781
01:12:21,254 --> 01:12:22,713
You'll be on your own soon.

782
01:12:25,675 --> 01:12:26,509
Yeah.

783
01:12:28,636 --> 01:12:31,055
I need to ask your word on something.

784
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:34,350
Yeah, of course, anything.
Whatever you want.

785
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:37,144
I need you to promise

786
01:12:38,062 --> 01:12:41,274
that you'll always keep her safe.

787
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:44,694
Tom...

788
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:48,614
of course I will. I promise you.

789
01:12:49,907 --> 01:12:51,284
I promise you.

790
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:03,629
You know...

791
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:07,842
there's something I need to tell you.

792
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:09,343
Nah.

793
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:10,845
I know.

794
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:14,640
No, no. You don't know this, Tom.
No, you don't know.

795
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:19,270
Sam's pregnant.

796
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:21,439
I know.

797
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:23,774
What?

798
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:25,860
What do you mean you know?
How'd you know?

799
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:28,988
Paula, she called her after our dinner,

800
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:31,324
and Sam told her everything.

801
01:13:31,908 --> 01:13:34,327
Said that you're having a baby boy!

802
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:43,002
- So, all this time you...
- Yeah.

803
01:13:44,378 --> 01:13:45,212
All this...

804
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:48,132
You fuck.

805
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:53,721
You know, I...

806
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:57,016
I got to tell you something else, too.

807
01:13:59,602 --> 01:14:01,062
I got to tell you about the boat.

808
01:14:02,021 --> 01:14:04,774
Seriously? You know, why don't you quit
while you're ahead on this.

809
01:14:09,362 --> 01:14:11,113
You know all that shit you gave me,

810
01:14:11,906 --> 01:14:13,324
over the last six years?

811
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:16,452
The really funny thing is you...

812
01:14:17,745 --> 01:14:21,332
you think it was me that was driving
that boat when it crashed into the rock.

813
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:24,543
- Get out! It was Sam?
- Yeah. Hell, yeah.

814
01:14:27,588 --> 01:14:29,423
She was drunk. I mean,

815
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:33,010
drunk as anything. I mean,
we both were and...

816
01:14:33,928 --> 01:14:36,055
you know, when we came down
in the morning,

817
01:14:37,098 --> 01:14:40,351
and we see the boat, it had sunk to
the bottom of the fucking lake, I mean...

818
01:14:42,561 --> 01:14:43,980
I don't know, I just...

819
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:47,108
I thought it was the right thing to do,
you know

820
01:14:49,235 --> 01:14:50,069
Say it was me.

821
01:14:52,363 --> 01:14:53,531
Sam still doesn't know.

822
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:57,243
You're a good man.

823
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:01,288
You're gonna be a good father.

824
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:05,459
Yeah.

825
01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:28,190
She's gonna be fine, Tom.

826
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:31,444
She's gonna be fine.

827
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:44,206
Maybe we can get some help here.

828
01:16:05,519 --> 01:16:08,814
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

829
01:16:16,155 --> 01:16:19,492
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

830
01:16:33,881 --> 01:16:34,757
Fuck.

831
01:16:41,222 --> 01:16:42,431
- Take it slow.
- Yeah.

832
01:16:48,854 --> 01:16:50,106
We need to get past.

833
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:52,858
My friend is sick. He needs a doctor.

834
01:17:00,407 --> 01:17:01,242
We have money.

835
01:17:02,743 --> 01:17:03,744
Bring the car here.

836
01:17:04,328 --> 01:17:05,287
We'll get you help.

837
01:17:07,248 --> 01:17:09,333
All right, we're coming.
Just don't shoot.

838
01:17:14,255 --> 01:17:15,214
What are you doing?

839
01:17:15,589 --> 01:17:19,009
- Wait, we can't go over there.
- Yeah, no shit, Tom.

840
01:17:37,444 --> 01:17:38,529
Ah, fuck.

841
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:51,750
Grab the gun, Will.

842
01:17:58,007 --> 01:17:58,883
Good job.

843
01:18:00,134 --> 01:18:01,010
Fuck!

844
01:18:14,273 --> 01:18:15,900
Good. You did good.

845
01:18:18,068 --> 01:18:19,570
They're coming from both ways.

846
01:18:21,197 --> 01:18:22,198
Turn around!

847
01:18:39,757 --> 01:18:40,883
Give me the gun, Will.

848
01:18:44,303 --> 01:18:47,556
When I say three,
I want you to swerve to your left.

849
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:55,731
One... two... three!

850
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:11,372
Oh, shit, Tom.

851
01:19:21,674 --> 01:19:22,508
Tom.

852
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:25,344
Tom?

853
01:20:48,052 --> 01:20:49,511
- [engine splutters]
- No, no, no. Fuck!

854
01:20:50,054 --> 01:20:50,929
Come on!

855
01:20:52,181 --> 01:20:54,266
Come on! No!

856
01:21:06,653 --> 01:21:08,655
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

857
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:11,575
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck, you fucking...

858
01:21:11,825 --> 01:21:12,659
Fuck!

859
01:21:13,744 --> 01:21:15,245
Fuck! Fuck.

860
01:21:15,788 --> 01:21:16,705
Fuck.

861
01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:18,082
Fuck.

862
01:21:29,968 --> 01:21:31,136
I'm sorry, Tom.

863
01:23:23,582 --> 01:23:24,833
Hey, hey!

864
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:44,853
Where you going?

865
01:23:45,687 --> 01:23:47,814
I'm going west, trying to get to Seattle.

866
01:23:49,107 --> 01:23:50,025
We're going north.

867
01:23:53,987 --> 01:23:56,615
We've been staying off the interstate.
It's not safe.

868
01:23:56,698 --> 01:23:57,699
Yeah, I know.

869
01:24:03,205 --> 01:24:04,957
All right, we'll take you
as far as we can.

870
01:24:05,249 --> 01:24:06,667
- OK.
- I'm gonna need that.

871
01:24:09,127 --> 01:24:10,337
I got family in the car.

872
01:24:17,177 --> 01:24:18,011
OK.

873
01:24:18,554 --> 01:24:19,388
OK.

874
01:24:20,430 --> 01:24:21,557
Easy.

875
01:24:25,686 --> 01:24:26,520
All right.

876
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:58,093
[announcer]
<i>This message is being broadcast...</i>

877
01:25:02,973 --> 01:25:04,850
This message is being broadcast...

878
01:25:10,147 --> 01:25:10,981
Nothing.

879
01:25:14,026 --> 01:25:15,527
Do you have any idea what happened?

880
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:17,321
We still don't know.

881
01:25:17,904 --> 01:25:20,324
Started in Los Angeles.
Or at least...

882
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,035
what it was.

883
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:27,331
They're saying go to Canada.
Something about the air.

884
01:25:29,666 --> 01:25:32,419
- It's been three days now?
- No. Today's day five.

885
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:37,591
I'm guessing you haven't slept.

886
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,010
Yeah, you and me both.

887
01:25:49,645 --> 01:25:50,979
You should take this exit.

888
01:26:20,425 --> 01:26:21,343
Hello!

889
01:26:26,098 --> 01:26:26,973
Come on.

890
01:26:32,854 --> 01:26:33,772
Hello?

891
01:26:34,606 --> 01:26:35,524
Dad?

892
01:26:45,575 --> 01:26:46,618
You sure this is OK?

893
01:26:48,495 --> 01:26:50,455
Yeah, yeah. It's my father's place.

894
01:26:52,457 --> 01:26:54,793
There's bedrooms upstairs
if you want to rest.

895
01:26:54,876 --> 01:26:57,963
And hopefully there's some food
in the kitchen, take a look.

896
01:27:00,882 --> 01:27:01,925
All right, thank you.

897
01:27:02,843 --> 01:27:03,677
Yeah.

898
01:27:46,553 --> 01:27:47,679
Well, they're asleep.

899
01:27:49,389 --> 01:27:50,599
Look, I just want to say

900
01:27:51,475 --> 01:27:52,809
we really appreciate this.

901
01:27:57,105 --> 01:27:59,941
There's about three weeks of food here.

902
01:28:01,193 --> 01:28:04,613
Generator last will you five days,
maybe more if you're conservative.

903
01:28:05,739 --> 01:28:08,909
There's one car in the garage,
but I had to siphon off most of the gas.

904
01:28:08,992 --> 01:28:11,703
But if you look around,
you're gonna find enough to get north.

905
01:28:12,829 --> 01:28:14,331
But I need to leave right now.

906
01:28:15,415 --> 01:28:16,917
And I need a four-wheel drive.

907
01:28:18,418 --> 01:28:20,295
Which means I need to take your Jeep.

908
01:28:21,630 --> 01:28:23,340
That's the deal that I'm offering.

909
01:28:29,846 --> 01:28:30,847
Sure. Yeah.

910
01:28:41,024 --> 01:28:41,858
Shit.

911
01:32:59,657 --> 01:33:00,492
You're alive.

912
01:33:38,655 --> 01:33:39,489
Hello?

913
01:33:41,699 --> 01:33:43,368
- This is private property!
- Will!

914
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:45,495
- Will. Oh, my God!
- Sam!

915
01:33:45,912 --> 01:33:46,746
Will

916
01:33:46,913 --> 01:33:49,415
He's our neighbor, Will.
Put your guns down!

917
01:33:52,585 --> 01:33:53,503
Will.

918
01:33:54,379 --> 01:33:55,213
You're OK.

919
01:33:55,713 --> 01:33:56,840
- You're OK.
- I'm OK.

920
01:33:58,007 --> 01:33:59,717
We're OK, Will.

921
01:34:00,844 --> 01:34:01,678
You're alive.

922
01:34:02,512 --> 01:34:03,388
You're alive.

923
01:34:03,847 --> 01:34:05,598
- I can't believe it.
- The baby's OK.

924
01:34:06,808 --> 01:34:09,227
Oh, God. You're alive.

925
01:34:19,529 --> 01:34:22,448
- Come here. Please, come here.
- I'm here.

926
01:34:23,158 --> 01:34:24,075
Come here.

927
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:33,251
You know, I wouldn't have made it
without him.

928
01:34:33,710 --> 01:34:34,711
I wouldn't be alive.

929
01:34:37,463 --> 01:34:39,591
And I did everything I could.
I did everything.

930
01:34:39,674 --> 01:34:40,800
I know, baby.

931
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:43,553
I know you did.

932
01:34:49,058 --> 01:34:50,685
I'm never gonna leave you again.

933
01:35:07,535 --> 01:35:08,369
I love you.

934
01:36:01,506 --> 01:36:02,340
- Hey.
- Hey.

935
01:36:03,216 --> 01:36:04,425
- Hi.
- Hi.

936
01:36:04,968 --> 01:36:05,969
Hi.

937
01:36:11,307 --> 01:36:13,893
You know, when I saw Seattle,
I didn't think that...

938
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:17,522
Just thank you.

939
01:36:19,649 --> 01:36:20,817
What are neighbors for?

940
01:36:24,612 --> 01:36:26,281
You... You want one?

941
01:36:26,990 --> 01:36:27,824
Yeah, sure.

942
01:36:36,291 --> 01:36:37,125
Thank you.

943
01:36:39,794 --> 01:36:41,045
It all happened so fast.

944
01:36:41,713 --> 01:36:42,797
Yeah, it was maybe...

945
01:36:43,798 --> 01:36:45,008
ten, fifteen minutes

946
01:36:45,091 --> 01:36:48,261
before the police were just yelling
at everybody to evacuate.

947
01:36:48,886 --> 01:36:50,471
I mean, you could see the Sound

948
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:53,182
and the water retreat. I've never seen
anything like that before.

949
01:36:53,683 --> 01:36:56,102
We were a couple miles inland
by the time the waves hit.

950
01:36:57,145 --> 01:36:58,062
You could hear it.

951
01:36:58,396 --> 01:36:59,605
- It was horrible.
- Yeah.

952
01:36:59,897 --> 01:37:01,357
And just so you know, Will...

953
01:37:03,234 --> 01:37:05,111
I don't think this was an earthquake.

954
01:37:06,279 --> 01:37:07,530
I'm a software engineer.

955
01:37:08,114 --> 01:37:10,533
I've seen tons of war games simulations,

956
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:13,286
including this exact scenario.

957
01:37:14,454 --> 01:37:15,747
Events just like this.

958
01:37:16,456 --> 01:37:17,373
They're designed

959
01:37:18,291 --> 01:37:21,753
to erase rational behavior with what
appears to be a singular incident.

960
01:37:23,338 --> 01:37:24,172
But really...

961
01:37:25,048 --> 01:37:26,174
it's all synchronized.

962
01:37:26,674 --> 01:37:28,009
What the fuck you talking about?

963
01:37:28,885 --> 01:37:29,719
Will...

964
01:37:30,636 --> 01:37:33,264
- Look, I'm not trying to upset you.
- You're not upsetting me.

965
01:37:34,140 --> 01:37:34,974
Good.

966
01:37:36,934 --> 01:37:39,437
I know the last couple days
have been rough on you.

967
01:37:47,945 --> 01:37:50,698
I mean, come on, you don't really believe
this bullshit, do you?

968
01:37:51,199 --> 01:37:52,200
This is not...

969
01:37:52,658 --> 01:37:56,621
I just drove across the fucking country.
You can't create things that I've seen.

970
01:37:57,663 --> 01:38:00,208
- Seriously, are you fucking with me?
- No, I'm not fucking with you.

971
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:03,753
Think about it in laymen's terms.
A nuclear bomb goes off the coast.

972
01:38:04,087 --> 01:38:08,466
Then a virus takes down the grid before
anyone can figure out what happened.

973
01:38:11,803 --> 01:38:14,514
- I've seen the intel.
- You haven't seen it. There is no intel.

974
01:38:14,597 --> 01:38:17,809
- That is fucking bullshit.
- The bomb plays like an earthquake.

975
01:38:17,892 --> 01:38:19,811
That's what causes the waves.

976
01:38:20,561 --> 01:38:21,604
Yeah?

977
01:38:21,896 --> 01:38:24,273
But the power going out,
that created the chaos.

978
01:38:25,525 --> 01:38:27,360
Don't you think it's strange that...

979
01:38:28,486 --> 01:38:30,238
the power just went out everywhere?

980
01:38:32,156 --> 01:38:35,159
The communications? I mean,
just fucking think about it, man.

981
01:38:37,370 --> 01:38:40,832
Unless, I don't know, I don't know.
Maybe he believes in coincidences.

982
01:38:44,001 --> 01:38:44,836
Baby?

983
01:38:46,045 --> 01:38:47,422
Baby, come on.

984
01:38:49,173 --> 01:38:50,007
You need sleep.

985
01:38:50,675 --> 01:38:52,093
I'm gonna clean up here. all right?

986
01:38:52,176 --> 01:38:54,679
And we can talk about all this
in the morning, all right?

987
01:38:54,762 --> 01:38:57,390
When you've had a good rest
and you're feeling better, OK?

988
01:38:57,974 --> 01:38:58,808
Come on.

989
01:39:00,935 --> 01:39:04,147
You know, there was an ash cloud
over the ocean.

990
01:39:05,148 --> 01:39:06,399
Seattle is gone,

991
01:39:07,316 --> 01:39:08,943
God knows how many other cities.

992
01:39:09,944 --> 01:39:12,280
I don't know what the fuck is going on,

993
01:39:12,530 --> 01:39:15,324
and you do not know what the fuck
is going on either.

994
01:39:15,408 --> 01:39:17,076
So, let's not pretend that you do, OK?

995
01:39:19,871 --> 01:39:20,705
OK.

996
01:39:27,086 --> 01:39:28,546
They happen all the time now.

997
01:39:31,549 --> 01:39:32,383
Yeah.

998
01:39:34,302 --> 01:39:36,429
Well, in the end,
it doesn't really matter, I guess.

999
01:39:37,180 --> 01:39:38,014
Why?

1000
01:39:39,432 --> 01:39:40,558
We all have to live, right?

1001
01:39:41,726 --> 01:39:42,560
No matter what.

1002
01:39:43,686 --> 01:39:44,645
I'll drink to that.

1003
01:39:47,857 --> 01:39:49,400
Come on. Let's go.

1004
01:39:49,901 --> 01:39:50,902
Hey, can I...

1005
01:39:51,569 --> 01:39:52,987
Can I see that SIG of yours?

1006
01:39:57,200 --> 01:39:58,034
Sure.

1007
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:11,964
It's nice.

1008
01:40:15,301 --> 01:40:17,011
Be nicer with bullets, though, right?

1009
01:40:18,888 --> 01:40:19,805
Good night.

1010
01:40:23,309 --> 01:40:24,519
- Good night.
- Good night.

1011
01:40:32,902 --> 01:40:34,737
I know he helped you,
but he just...

1012
01:40:35,988 --> 01:40:39,075
Tell me you don't believe
that bullshit that he's telling you?

1013
01:40:39,242 --> 01:40:40,117
I don't.

1014
01:40:47,375 --> 01:40:48,417
You and the baby...

1015
01:40:49,835 --> 01:40:51,546
are the only thing that matters.

1016
01:40:54,674 --> 01:40:55,591
The only thing.

1017
01:42:13,461 --> 01:42:14,962
- Hey.
- Hey.

1018
01:42:17,798 --> 01:42:18,758
You seeing this?

1019
01:42:19,925 --> 01:42:21,427
Still think it's a simulation?

1020
01:42:24,096 --> 01:42:25,014
No.

1021
01:42:27,642 --> 01:42:28,976
I owe you an apo...

1022
01:42:31,228 --> 01:42:32,688
I let the whiskey do the talking.

1023
01:42:34,106 --> 01:42:38,361
I guess I just convinced myself that
that would put me more in control, but...

1024
01:42:40,029 --> 01:42:41,656
It doesn't make me crazy, right?

1025
01:42:44,492 --> 01:42:46,369
Why were you looking in my car
this morning?

1026
01:42:49,914 --> 01:42:52,667
I wasn't trying to steal your car, Will,
if that's what you're after.

1027
01:42:54,210 --> 01:42:55,461
You planning on leaving?

1028
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:57,630
By myself, no.

1029
01:43:01,217 --> 01:43:02,718
But we've got supplies here.

1030
01:43:09,392 --> 01:43:12,853
I saw two kids. I thought that maybe
they took something from your car.

1031
01:43:13,562 --> 01:43:14,814
Saw two kids. Right.

1032
01:43:19,235 --> 01:43:20,695
Where are these kids right now?

1033
01:43:22,238 --> 01:43:23,364
They're in the woods.

1034
01:43:25,491 --> 01:43:27,993
I've been running a perimeter
every morning since we got here.

1035
01:43:30,830 --> 01:43:32,331
Come with me, I'll show you.

1036
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:53,102
Must be a volcano around here.

1037
01:43:53,686 --> 01:43:54,770
Don't worry about it.

1038
01:44:15,541 --> 01:44:16,375
We're leaving.

1039
01:44:17,418 --> 01:44:19,378
Unless you want to stay,
you should come with us.

1040
01:44:21,547 --> 01:44:22,590
It's not safe here.

1041
01:44:23,924 --> 01:44:24,925
Where are you going?

1042
01:44:25,593 --> 01:44:26,427
North.

1043
01:44:35,060 --> 01:44:36,270
She wants to stay, Will.

1044
01:44:41,567 --> 01:44:43,152
I don't see any kids out here.

1045
01:44:48,824 --> 01:44:50,367
I'm not the boogie man, Will.

1046
01:44:51,911 --> 01:44:53,287
Remember, I saved her life.

1047
01:44:54,663 --> 01:44:57,291
We have a bond. That means I get a voice.

1048
01:44:59,794 --> 01:45:00,878
We thought you were dead.

1049
01:45:01,796 --> 01:45:03,964
Well, I'm not, am I?
I'm here.

1050
01:45:06,926 --> 01:45:08,385
You know she's pregnant, right?

1051
01:45:15,392 --> 01:45:16,727
You don't have to do this.

1052
01:45:23,150 --> 01:45:24,235
I do.

1053
01:45:52,179 --> 01:45:53,013
Sam!

1054
01:45:54,557 --> 01:45:55,391
Sam!

1055
01:45:56,433 --> 01:45:58,352
- What's happening?
- Something's coming.

1056
01:45:58,435 --> 01:46:00,020
- We have to go right now.
- What?

1057
01:46:00,104 --> 01:46:01,480
Go... Go where?

1058
01:46:01,772 --> 01:46:05,484
- OK. OK. Where's Jeremiah?
- He tried to kill me. Come on.

1059
01:46:05,860 --> 01:46:07,027
- We've got to go.
- What?

1060
01:46:08,988 --> 01:46:09,822
OK.

1061
01:46:10,239 --> 01:46:11,073
OK.

1062
01:46:23,043 --> 01:46:25,212
- What is it?
- It's happening again.

1063
01:46:32,511 --> 01:46:33,512
Oh, God!

1064
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:39,351
It's getting closer.

1065
01:46:41,186 --> 01:46:44,189
We're gonna make it. No matter
what happens, we're gonna make it, OK?

1066
01:46:51,155 --> 01:46:52,698
Look at me, OK? Look at me.

1067
01:46:53,324 --> 01:46:55,284
- It's gonna be OK.
- I know.

1068
01:46:57,286 --> 01:46:58,370
- I love you.
- I love you.
