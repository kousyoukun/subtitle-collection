1
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,465
Are we having a boy or a girl?

2
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,509
- You sure you want to know?
- Yes.

3
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,928
I can't take the suspense.

4
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,184
-Is everything gonna be OK?
-Your baby boy is healthy.

5
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:28,940
-Baby boy.
-Baby boy.

6
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,783
You alright?

7
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:40,451
Yeah.

8
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,414
-We got months to get ready.
-Yeah. I'm not worried about that.

9
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,624
Good. Then you shouldn't worry
about tonight either.

10
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,294
Right. 'Cause asking Tom Sutherland
for his daughter's hand

11
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:52,338
-is gonna be a walk in the park.
-Would you rather tell him I'm pregnant?

12
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,674
-Funny.
-It's gonna be alright.

13
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:57,260
Yeah. At least we'll have something
to talk about this time.

14
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,803
Just go easy on Dad.

15
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:02,640
Nothing to be afraid of.
Just don't bring up the boat.

16
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,267
I try not to bring up the boat,

17
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,811
but then I get nervous
and I end up bringing up the boat.

18
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:10,648
-He restored it himself, Will.
-Yeah, I am aware of that little detail.

19
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:22,994
I love you.

20
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:24,913
I love you, too.

21
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,332
-Good luck tonight.
-Thank you.

22
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,375
-You're gonna need it.
-I know.

23
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,462
-OK, I'll call you from the airport. Bye.
-Yeah.

24
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,525
OK, I think it's gonna be easy enough
to get things going between us.

25
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,569
-So, Tuesday? The same?
-Yeah.

26
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:57,737
OK, see you.

27
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:19,092
Hey, there. Mr. and Mrs. Sutherland.

28
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:38,027
-Hi. Good to see you.
-Hi. Good to see you, too.

29
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,488
Tom, honey? Will's here.

30
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:46,911
Hi, Tom.

31
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:48,746
Will.

32
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,666
-Good to see you.
-Yeah, you, too.

33
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:55,253
I was just about to fix myself
another drink.

34
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:59,382
Why don't you see if Paula
can use a little hand in the kitchen?

35
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,429
Yeah, sure.

36
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:10,143
-Anything I can do to help?
-Oh, no. You're our guest.

37
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:11,728
Relax.

38
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:13,604
Go talk to Tom.

39
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,106
Yeah.

40
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,112
Here you go.

41
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,572
Thank you.

42
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,158
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

43
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,415
-Why don't you have a seat?
-Thank you.

44
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,183
How we looking at time, hon?

45
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,478
Not too long. Enjoy your scotch.

46
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,734
Key West. Three years ago.

47
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:02,737
I think it was five, actually.

48
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,073
Sam has the same photo in our loft.

49
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,408
Right.

50
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,370
You came with us.
How could I forget that?

51
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,169
That's... Wow!

52
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:19,712
The boat. I remember this.

53
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,135
Took me almost as long to make that one
as it did the original.

54
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:33,309
Why don't you put her back down, Will?
Let's just stay on the safe side. Alright?

55
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,227
Yeah, of course.

56
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:39,857
Sam mentioned that the two of you
are thinking about

57
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,610
-finding a house.
-We're talking about it, yeah.

58
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:45,905
You know, at some point in the future
it'd be nice to have some more room.

59
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,449
-Here you go.
-I am of two minds about it, you know?

60
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,619
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

61
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,415
-What are you of two minds about?
-Providing assistance.

62
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,459
I need a guarantee
that if it doesn't work out,

63
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:02,630
you can't make any claims to the money
that I put down. Nothing personal, Will.

64
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:06,050
Sorry, I'm a little confused.
Did Sam ask you for help?

65
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:10,138
No, don't worry about any of that, Will.
We've helped her brother, Steven, too.

66
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,056
Right.

67
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:15,768
You know that I'm making good money
on this job, right?

68
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,813
If memory serves, you were unemployed
before you moved to Seattle. Sam had to

69
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:21,607
-support both of you for a while there.
-No, Sam didn't have to--

70
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,321
You know, like I said, work's good.

71
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,322
And...

72
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,200
you know, when it makes sense,
when...

73
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:34,537
when it's the right time,
then I'll open my own practice. But...

74
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,707
Well, in the meantime, we're fine.

75
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,460
-That's great.
-Doesn't sound like much of a plan, Will.

76
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:42,962
Tom.

77
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,131
Give it a rest.

78
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,384
Everyone wants the dream.

79
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,180
Problem with your generation is
that nobody wants to work for it.

80
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:56,267
I spent 27 years
serving our country.

81
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:00,771
I saved and I saved
until I started working for Northbridge,

82
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,524
where I started making
some real money. But...

83
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,693
I always had a plan.

84
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,655
You know, I have never asked anyone
for any help.

85
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,782
And you're not asking for anything now.

86
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,410
We're just offering to help our daughter.

87
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,579
Why did you move to Seattle?

88
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,539
OK, that's enough.

89
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:20,666
Honey.

90
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,085
I'm only asking because...

91
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,130
I suspect that Will moved

92
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,591
because he thought it would be easier.

93
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,677
Because he thought it would be more secure

94
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,138
if he moved my daughter away from me.

95
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:38,059
-Moving was Sam's idea.
 -Come on. It's...

96
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,103
You know what, I doubt that.
Sam would have told me that.

97
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:42,688
Oh, yeah?

98
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,151
You think she would have told you
that she wanted to move away

99
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:50,071
to start her life
on her own terms with me,

100
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,657
without her father breathing down
her fucking neck all the time?

101
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,077
Say what you've gotta say, spit it out.
Let us know how you really feel, Will.

102
00:08:58,412 --> 00:08:59,247
Sorry.

103
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,625
Get it off your chest,
but just don't swear in front of my wife.

104
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,672
Whose table do you think
you're sitting at?

105
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:12,593
Will...

106
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,930
Sweetheart, it's getting late.
Let me walk you out.

107
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:19,850
Come on.

108
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:40,913
Hey.

109
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,166
<i>Am I your wake-up call?</i>

110
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,669
No, no, I was just...

111
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,797
I was just lying down after the gym.

112
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,301
<i>Yeah, I don't think so.</i>
<i>You look like shit.</i>

113
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,679
<i>What time is your flight?</i>

114
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,974
Soon. What time is it?

115
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:02,768
<i>Six in the morning.</i>

116
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,772
<i>-In Seattle.</i>
-Fuck, fuck.

117
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,275
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

118
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,152
<i>So,  my mother just called.</i>

119
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,822
Oh, that's... that's great.

120
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,907
Wait, wait. What did she say?

121
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,327
<i>What do you think she said?</i>

122
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:24,874
Yeah, OK. I'm sorry, alright?
I'm sorry, but, Sam, look,

123
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,045
he was into me from the second
I got in, OK? I guarantee you

124
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,673
if I'd asked for his blessing last night,
he would have said no. So I didn't.

125
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:35,468
<i>-My mother asked you to leave.</i>
-No, no, she didn't.

126
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:39,013
It wasn't quite like that.
She didn't ask me to leave.

127
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,389
<i>Just call her.</i>

128
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,768
I'm really, really fucking late, OK?
I gotta go.

129
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:46,270
<i>OK, fine. Just call me</i>
<i>when you get to the airport.</i>

130
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,315
What was that? What was that?

131
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:53,527
<i>Power's out.</i>

132
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,780
What is that noise?

133
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,574
<i>Will, something's wrong.</i>

134
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,785
- Sam, what the hell is that?
<i>- I'm scared.</i>

135
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:01,702
<i>Will...</i>

136
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,663
Sam, can you hea---

137
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,874
Jesus.

138
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:07,792
Hello?

139
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:46,872
Come on, Sam. Hi, it's me.
I'm at the airport. Give me a call.

140
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,374
This way, sir.

00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,269
Shit. Fuck.

158
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,696
Sam, it's me. Call me.

159
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,200
Hey, it's me again. Call me
as soon as you get this, alright?

160
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,935
-Will. Thanks, Mark.
-Thanks.

161
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,898
Are you OK? Will's here.

162
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,860
I guess that answers that question.

163
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,946
We thought that there was a chance
that you flew back.

164
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:28,075
They shut down O'Hare.
I didn't know where else to go.

165
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,828
Well, have you talked to Sam?
I haven't been able to reach her.

166
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:33,831
Yeah. I was on the phone to her
when it happened.

167
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,624
I heard something, so did she.

168
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,544
-What did you hear?
-I don't know. It was like a...

169
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:42,464
Like a loud rumble or something.
I didn't know what it was. And then...

170
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:43,841
we got disconnected.

171
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,802
-What's the last thing she said?
-She said something's wrong.

172
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,138
But she sounded scared.

173
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,893
Alright, I'm gonna go pack up the rest
of my things. Yours are on the table.

174
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,617
-I should head back to the airport.
-I thought you said they shut it down.

175
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,661
Yeah, but once the power comes back on,
there'll be flights, right?

176
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,955
Let's look at what we know, Will.

177
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,917
There was an event,
a couple of hours ago, out west.

178
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,795
The power shut off here,
two thousand miles away.

179
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:25,966
We have no idea what's happening,
yet we've got F-22s doing flybys.

180
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,929
This moment is not about waiting
for the power to come back on.

181
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,849
The only thing that we can control
is what we decide to do.

182
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,602
So, what? What are you saying?
What are you gonna do?

183
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:37,603
Get on the road.

184
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,564
What, you're gonna drive to Seattle?

185
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,692
Paula can stay at Steven's.

186
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,153
They'll be fine there.

187
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:48,697
But my only daughter...

188
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:50,407
she's alone.

189
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,411
I only have one question for you.

190
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,539
Are you coming with me?

191
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,639
-Don't stop for anyone.
-Got it.

192
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,475
Steven's prepared for everything.

193
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,394
-OK.
-You'll be safe there.

194
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,981
-I love you. Be safe.
-You'll be alright.

195
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,565
You, too.

196
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,859
-Bye.
-Let's go.

197
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,656
How can cell service still be out?

198
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,243
GPS is out, too.

199
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,952
-You got money?
-Yeah.

200
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,038
Fill her up with gas,
I'll go get supplies. -Hey, man you got cash?
-Yeah.

201
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,004
-Cash only, right? Thanks.
-Thanks.

202
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,780
Nice car, cutie.

203
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,408
Wanna show me the back seat?

204
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:40,619
Yeah, I don't think so.

205
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,371
Excuse me?

206
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,541
What'd you say?

207
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,085
-What are you talking about?
-What's going on, Liza?

208
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,922
-This piece of shit just called me a slut.
-What? Whoa, no, no.

209
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:55,008
Hey, I didn't call you a slut.

210
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,885
I think this is gonna
fucking cost you, man.

211
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,096
-OK, OK.
-Hey! Don't do that. -That's my car.
-Shut the fuck up, old man!

212
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:05,435
Hey, pops.

213
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,689
-Come on, I know you got some cash.
-All right.

214
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,317
The money's in my luggage.

215
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,029
Don't look at Liza. What are you looking at?

216
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:20,951
Whoa, whoa!

217
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,620
-Jesus Christ, Tom.
-Get back in the car, Will.

218
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,455
Start running and don't look back!

219
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,333
Punk.

220
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,449
Is there something you want to say?

221
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,037
You should've told me.

222
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:09,208
-Told you what?
-Told me that you had a gun.

223
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,586
And what would you have said, Will?

224
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,672
I'm assuming that you've never fired
a firearm before.

225
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:20,052
No, I haven't used a firearm, but it's not
exactly a priority in my law firm, is it?

226
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:25,390
You know what, Will,
what if they had taken this car?

227
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,519
Game over. It would be game over!

228
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,748
<i>Interstate 90 westbound is closed.</i>

229
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:55,254
<i>Well, something must be going on</i>
<i>if they're not letting us through.</i>

230
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:59,007
-Is there another way?
-No. We need this road.

231
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,385
<i>Interstate 90 is closed.</i>

232
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:02,970
<i>Stop, hold it there.</i>

233
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,723
Sir, the road's closed ahead.
Follow the other cars. Thank you.

234
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,184
I'm sorry, Sergeant. But we got
a lot of miles in front of us,

235
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,561
and you're shutting down
the biggest highway in the country.

236
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,897
Public safety issue, sir.
On account of the power outage.

237
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,275
No help for you out there
if you have a flat or an accident.

238
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,944
Let's get this traffic moving.

239
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,697
-What are you doing?
-Can I just have a word, Sergeant?

240
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,825
I understand you got a job to do.

241
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,619
And I know you got orders.
I've been there.

242
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,539
I spent the better part of my adult life
in the Marine Corps.

243
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:32,499
Sir.

244
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,668
We'd be on our own, I understand.

245
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,129
But my daughter's a long ways
in that direction. I'm asking, can you help me?

246
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,804
Yeah. Get in the car.

247
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:52,811
Let the Caddy through!
Local traffic, lives past the next exit.

248
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,856
-Thank you, Sergeant.
-Good luck, sir.

249
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,150
Well done.

250
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,026
Apparently, we're not the only ones
heading west.

251
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,988
The F-22s, the road block.
What is this?

252
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:46,490
It's not good. Yeah.

253
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,838
Jesus Christ.
I didn't even see him coming.

254
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,850
I have no reception.

255
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,644
He probably can't run our plates.

256
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:02,649
I'm gonna check it out, OK?

257
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:03,942
Careful.

258
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,445
Officer?

259
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,241
He's not a cop.

260
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,952
<i>-Is there a problem, Officer?</i>
<i>-Get back in the car!</i>

261
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,704
Will! Get back in the car!

262
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,622
Tell your friend to get out
of the fucking car!

263
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,667
-OK. Fuck.
-Tell him to get out of the fucking car!

264
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,092
Will, let's go! Go, go, go!

265
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,390
Who the fuck was that?

266
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:37,976
Fuck. Get the ammo for the SIG
in the trunk!

267
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,729
-What? It wasn't loaded before?
-I didn't need it to be. Will, just get the ammo out of the go bag.

268
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:49,738
You see the black bag? Little black bag?

269
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,324
-Yeah, I got it. He's coming!
-Take it out.

270
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,284
Put the mag into the weapon.

271
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:02,626
-How do I do it?
-Put the mag in the gun.

272
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:09,049
Hit the button on the side.
Shoot. You gotta do it. Shoot.

273
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,222
Shoot! Shoot, shoot!

274
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:18,266
-Fuck, it's not working! What do I do?
-Pull it back! Put it in the chamber!

275
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,810
Put the bullet in the chamber.
Pull the top back.

276
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:23,396
-See if you have a cartridge inside.
-Fuck!

277
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,318
Come on!

278
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,529
Come on! Come on!

279
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:32,572
Fuck you!

280
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:35,617
Come on! Fuck!

281
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,160
Hold on.

282
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,625
Fuck.

283
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:50,423
All right, OK. OK.

284
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:51,883
Fuck.

285
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,444
-Shit!
-Hold on!

286
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:44,603
Tom.

287
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:57,657
Ah, fuck.

288
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,496
Get out of the car, faggot. Now.

289
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:15,467
You OK?

290
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:31,941
You all right?

291
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,236
I think I broke my ribs.

292
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:38,031
We're gonna need to find a garage.

293
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:56,317
Hey.

294
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,027
Do you work here?

295
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,365
We were...
We've been in an accident.

296
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,410
Yeah?

297
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,495
Where' s the trooper?

298
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,080
It was abandoned.

299
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,213
-You guys even know where you are?
-No.

300
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,927
-We were hoping for your help.
-You guys got money?

301
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,847
-I ain't doing shit for free.
-Nor should you.

302
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,017
I can take a look.

303
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,811
If you need new parts, I can't help you.

304
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,856
-Understood.
-Restroom's all the way in the back.

305
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,040
Hey! I told you not to fuck with them!

306
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,418
Who the fuck do you think you are?

307
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,045
Leave me alone!

308
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,386
<i>So, all cell service goes out.</i>

309
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:09,682
<i>Virtually all communications, except local</i>
<i>ham radio like us or short wave.</i>

310
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:14,938
<i>But how does that happen, huh?</i>
<i>US Government goes virtually silent?</i>

311
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:19,692
<i>Are we talking World War Three?</i>
<i>Like a nuke attack that went sideways?</i>

312
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:22,278
<i>I mean, the damned president's doing</i>
<i>a massive cover-up.</i>

313
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,908
<i>Military coup? Martial law?</i>
<i>We don't know, we don't know.</i>

314
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:30,203
<i>If anyone out there who knows anything,</i>
<i>get on short wave. Please, do it now.</i>

315
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:31,996
<i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>

316
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,624
<i>- Is anyone out there?</i>
<i>- Two thousand satellites in space,</i>

317
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:36,459
<i>- all of them down?</i>
<i>- Answer me, I--</i>

318
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,962
<i>Government knows, man.</i>
<i>They're just keeping it from us.</i>

319
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,588
<i>Is there anyone...</i>

320
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:44,801
<i>I need help! Mayday!</i>

321
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:48,388
<i>Mayday! Is anyone out there?</i>

322
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,019
I sealed the radiator. It should hold.

323
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,438
-You can keep driving for a while.
-A while?

324
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:40,648
What if it breaks?

325
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:44,360
Radiator isn't gonna break.
Might start leaking again, though.

326
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:47,405
I can give you some of the sealant,
show you how to use it.

327
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:48,907
OK.

328
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,952
I'll gave you $200 for the labor.

329
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:56,205
And if we get to where we're going,
I'll mail you another two.

330
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:59,918
Yeah. How about you give me
that other two right now?

331
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:02,712
Hey.

332
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,090
Is that your Buick out there?

333
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:07,592
Yeah.

334
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:09,802
-Does it run?
-Why?

335
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:11,804
Wanna sell it?

336
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,727
No, I was gonna head out to California
and get the fuck out of this place.

337
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:22,106
But now all she needs is a new
transmission, so she ain't for sale.

338
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,359
Then maybe you should come with us.

339
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,614
-I don't think so.
-We're going out west.

340
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:33,201
Yeah? Why would I want to go with you?

341
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,622
'Cause I'll give you $1,000.

342
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:44,462
You can keep the cash
and be almost all the way to California.

343
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:46,923
If you have any problems or a break down,
you can fix it.

344
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,800
Look.

345
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:52,804
No disrespect, but I ain't about
doing no road trip right now

346
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:55,264
with two shady dudes
that appear out of nowhere.

347
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,392
Whoa, whoa.
We're not shady, come on.

348
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:02,188
You two roll up in a fucked-up,
shot up cop car that you say you found,

349
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:04,524
towing a shot up Caddy, and...

350
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,485
You know, you got blood
all over your face. So, yeah.

351
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,945
Shady as fuck.

352
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,781
I hear you loud and clear.
Doesn't look good.

353
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,033
Doesn't look good.

354
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:17,912
I could tell you that it wasn't us.

355
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:19,747
That...

356
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:22,917
we were you just defending ourselves.
I could tell you

357
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:26,421
actually what happened,
down to the very last detail, but...

358
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:29,298
if I were you,
I'm not sure I would believe that either.

359
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:33,136
But I can tell you this.

360
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:37,807
With a clear conscience,
I can look you in the eye and I can say...

361
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,187
there's a lot to be afraid of out there.

362
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:46,232
A lot of real danger.

363
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:50,236
None of us know how much.

364
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:52,989
But...

365
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:54,907
me...

366
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:56,909
him...

367
00:33:58,911 --> 00:33:59,746
we're not it.

368
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:02,373
I'm Tom.

369
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:04,167
This is Will.

370
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:12,216
We're just driving out west
to see if we can find my daughter.

371
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,434
All right.

372
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:23,519
I've heard enough.

373
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:26,397
So, you'll help us?

374
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:32,320
Did I say that?

375
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,455
I'm going to the car.

376
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:47,376
I'll do it for two thousand.

377
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:52,882
OK. Great.

378
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:04,685
Got the essentials.

379
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:08,064
As long as we don't snap an axle,
I can get us to Seattle.

380
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:09,023
Great.

381
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,401
Oh, and I siphoned the cop's gas.

382
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:19,951
-What are you doing?
-I want us to be invisible from behind.

383
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,123
-Here you go, Will. Drive the first shift.
-OK.

384
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,459
You ride in the back.

385
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,963
Course Tonto rides in the fucking back.

386
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:37,468
Chill. Whoa, I was kidding.

387
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:42,849
What's he doing?

388
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,434
Better not fucking come back.

389
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:46,686
Take it easy, man!

390
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:47,854
Just drive.

391
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,256
So, you guys got a radio signal?

392
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,008
Not here.

393
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,977
Is there a frontage road to the 90?
Another way west?

394
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:32,732
Take a left here.
Can head out on the 14 West for a while.

395
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,277
All right. OK.

396
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,866
What kinda music you guys into?

397
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:44,493
Yeah, I don't think
it's that kind of road trip, Ricki.

398
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,056
There's someone behind us.

399
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,141
Pull over.

400
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:09,268
Lights off.

401
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:31,666
Catch up.

402
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,709
-Use their taillights to guide us.
-OK.

403
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:53,896
Want some?

404
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,606
No. No, thanks.

405
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,027
Think he's asleep.

406
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:03,155
Yeah, let him. He's gonna want to drive
when he wakes up.

407
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,491
Then I'll get some sleep.

408
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,621
So, his daughter... that's your girl?

409
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:13,332
Yeah. Yeah, she is.

410
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:24,802
Whoa. Check it out.

411
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,142
It's crazy.

412
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,479
-They on our side of the road?
-Jesus!

413
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,192
Oh, my God!

414
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:48,075
Fuck.

415
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:01,464
Survivors?

416
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,424
No.

417
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:09,722
Fuck, Jesus Christ.

418
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,017
She's dead.

419
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:16,812
What's he saying?

420
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,649
-I think it's a telephone number.
-Will, let him be.

421
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,152
We can't just leave him!

422
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:26,530
We're hours from a hospital,
and this guy, he's not gonna make it.

423
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:29,700
Let's get back in the car.
Let's go, guys. Let's go. Let's go.

424
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,495
Will?

425
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,830
Let's go. Ricki!

426
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:41,379
Leave them. Ricki, come on!

427
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:53,557
Shit. Shit, shit, shit.

428
00:39:58,354 --> 00:39:59,397
What's he doing?

429
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:10,783
Fuck! Let's go.

430
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:20,584
You gotta stop the car for Ricki.
Stop the car, Tom. Stop the fucking car!

431
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:23,838
Let's go! Come on!

432
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,423
Go, go!

433
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:40,229
If Will hadn't told me to wait,
I would've left you.

434
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:42,565
Whatever.

435
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:45,860
See if I fix your car
if it breaks down again.

436
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,029
What the fuck?

437
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:52,783
We had a deal. If you're not gonna
honor it, you need to speak up now.

438
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,206
All right, then.

439
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:28,486
You OK?

440
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:30,404
Whatever.

441
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,281
Yeah, he can be pretty hard.

442
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:35,618
Think that's hard?

443
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:39,622
You don't know what hard is, man.

444
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:45,085
Yeah, maybe not.

445
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,339
So, why California, huh?

446
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,883
I'm gonna become a rapper.

447
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:52,968
Come on, seriously?

448
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,638
What? You don't think that I got it?

449
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:57,139
No, no.

450
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:02,520
No, of course I do. I just, you know,
I thought it was a pretty odd career path.

451
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,480
Totally fucking with you.

452
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:08,526
Nice.

453
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,325
You ever seen clouds like that before?

454
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,039
Hell, no.

455
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,378
Something's coming.

456
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:32,841
-Go, go! Get in the car!
-Get in!

457
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:51,151
What the fuck is this?

458
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:04,206
Holy shit.

459
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,594
You see the bridge? Do you see it?

460
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:22,600
What the fuck is going on?

461
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:39,658
-Never seen a storm like this.
-This is crazy.

462
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:06,685
Think that was lightning?

463
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:16,111
-Turn it up.
-OK.

464
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:19,740
<i>...as much information as we can,</i>
<i>for as long as we can.</i>

465
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:22,868
<i>For as long as this generator will let us.</i>

466
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:27,790
<i>Still no internet. No cell service.</i>
<i>No nothing.</i>

467
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:29,917
At least not here.

468
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:40,886
You're gonna want to stay on the 17.

469
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:44,473
I have friends in Ashland Heights.
I already checked.

470
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,934
We can stop there. We can resupply.

471
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,479
We can resupply anywhere.
We don't wanna go out of our way.

472
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,564
Look, why don't we just stop, OK?

473
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:55,609
Ricki can check the car
and  my friends can help us.

474
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,279
-You just drive. I got the plans.
-I said they're friends, Tom.

475
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,532
They're not just my friends,
they're Sam's friends.

476
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,450
They're gonna wanna help us.

477
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:29,560
Whoa, whoa. Hey.

478
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,231
Something's wrong with the car.

479
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,367
No services here. No gas, no nothing.

480
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:49,496
We've been on the road for a long time.
A good friend of mine lives in the town.

481
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:54,334
Every car that stops here says
they got friends in this little town.

482
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:59,173
His name's Adam Dumont.
He was born and raised here.

483
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:01,925
I was a groomsman at his wedding.

484
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:05,971
My girlfriend and I have been here,
like, half a dozen times.

485
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:09,141
His wife, Meg,

486
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:13,771
she owns a pottery store in town.
I can't remember what the name of it is.

487
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:16,982
We just wanna get off the road for
a couple of hours and then we'll be gone.

488
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:24,406
-Harris!
-Yes, sir?

489
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:26,617
Find an escort for these boys
over to the Dumonts'.

490
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:30,287
And make sure, they get turned away,
they come straight back here.

491
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,789
OK, let them through.

492
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,874
-Good job.
-Let them through.

493
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,167
Just let them through.

494
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:42,424
<i>Is it North Korea? Is it the Chinese?</i>

495
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:46,220
<i>Who else could do this?</i>
<i>Who else would do this?</i>

496
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:49,306
<i>Damn it. Maybe they're in it together.</i>

497
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,308
<i>We don't know.</i>

498
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,436
<i>We do know they hate us.</i>

499
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:23,799
Will?

500
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:28,345
What are you doing here?

501
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:30,722
How did you even get here?

502
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:32,558
Hey.

503
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:38,355
This is Tom, Sam's dad.
And Ricki in the back.

504
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:41,358
Hey. We should all go inside.

505
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:42,568
-It's a lot cooler.
-Yeah.

506
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:47,114
I'm gonna take a couple of minutes
to check out the car and get organized.

507
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:50,367
-Where's... Where's Sam?
-I'll explain inside.

508
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:54,621
<i>The world is being prepared!</i>

509
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:57,749
<i>The Bible says, "The earth knew not</i>

510
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:00,627
<i>until the flood came and took them...</i>

511
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:04,006
When was last time you heard from Adam?

512
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:06,216
It must've been...

513
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:10,596
I guess the night before it all, so...

514
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:17,477
He's... He's on a business trip
to San Francisco.

515
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,525
Well, if anyone's gonna be OK, it's Adam.

516
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:31,074
I mean, none of this makes any sense.
It's just that...

517
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:36,872
These fucking storms and then this heat.
And we've been having earthquakes.

518
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,545
It's just... I mean, it's so crazy
that you're here and...

519
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,840
-It's gonna be OK, Meg.
-Yeah.

520
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:50,344
You know it...

521
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:53,931
it can't stay like this forever.

522
00:48:57,559 --> 00:48:59,394
Really? Do you really think that?

523
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:07,486
-Sorry. I haven't been sleeping and it...
-No, it's fine, It's OK.

524
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:14,534
Do you want to take a shower?
We still have plenty of water.

525
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,912
Yeah. That'd be good.

526
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:18,789
All right. Hey.

527
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:49,444
Hey.

528
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:56,368
-Need help?
-Nah, I just got one more left.

529
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:58,245
Thanks.

530
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,965
How do we not know anything?

531
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:17,055
Doesn't that tell you something, Will?
If they were all right, we would know.

532
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:25,522
I just...
None of this is real. It can't be real.

533
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:29,192
No one's telling me anything and...

534
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:32,529
and no one even knows that I'm here.

535
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:36,783
Adam knows you're here.
And he's coming back for you. I know that.

536
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:37,993
And what if he isn't?

537
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:40,746
Because...

538
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:44,249
Because I can feel it, Will.

539
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:47,002
I can feel that he's gone.

540
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:51,089
-I can feel it in my bones. I know it.
-No, no, no. Just...

541
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:54,176
And I know that Sam is gone, Will.
She's gone!

542
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:56,261
It's OK. It's OK.

543
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,554
It's OK.

544
00:50:58,638 --> 00:50:59,639
We're gonna be fine.

545
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,976
We are gonna be fine. OK?

546
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:05,103
Adam is coming back for you.

547
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:08,106
I gotta go.

548
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:26,374
Give me a hand?

549
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,337
We need to load the supplies in the car.

550
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,834
Look at that. That's military.

551
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:15,215
-Was it shot down?
-I don't know.

552
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:17,008
Jesus.

553
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:48,248
Let's see if there's anything useful
down there.

554
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:12,314
Oh, hell, yeah.

555
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:18,153
Oh, yeah.

556
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:23,283
Ricki, maybe you shouldn't...

557
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:29,623
Holy shit! Holy fuck! It's hot in there!

558
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:32,083
I thought it was gonna be cold.

559
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:33,877
Fuck!

560
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:40,842
-It's not funny.
-It kinda is a little bit funny.

561
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:42,886
Fucking assholes.

562
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,264
OK. We're gonna need to split up.

563
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:47,682
OK, Ricki...

564
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:53,271
Yeah. The Army base's.

565
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:55,649
Minutemen, missile silos.

566
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:56,816
It's a Blackhawk.

567
00:53:58,818 --> 00:53:59,986
You know about helicopters?

568
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,822
Not really. Just the irony.

569
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:06,076
Cheyenne, Chinook, Chickasaw, Apache.

570
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:09,287
I just think it's funny that the Army

571
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:12,457
named its helicopters after tribes
they tried to wipe out.

572
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:16,211
Right.

573
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:19,547
Look, Ricki. You're on gas detail.

574
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:22,175
Want you to grab the cans,
check out the cars,

575
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:25,387
look at the generators, whatever you find.
We're gonna go check out the diner.

576
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:48,243
So, what are we looking for?

577
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:50,745
Water, food.

578
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:53,123
Be sure to get what we need.

579
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:00,964
Cash is gone.

580
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:14,394
-I said get gas!
-I already found some.

581
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:18,815
Cars had their tires slashed,
but still had gas in the back.

582
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:23,611
Whoa, whoa. I got it.

583
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:26,489
I got it. You OK?

584
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:27,949
Fine.

585
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,042
-What's going on?
-He broke some ribs.

586
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:39,544
Come on. Let's go.

587
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,618
What's that?

588
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:15,747
Wake up. Both of you, wake up.

589
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:19,918
Check your phone. Ricki, check
your phone. Tom, check your phone now.

590
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:21,669
I just heard something.

591
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:24,255
I just heard.
We got cell reception, I think.

592
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:26,049
-I don't got nothing.
-No?

593
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,474
<i>Daddy?</i>

594
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:39,270
<i>I love you. Can you hear me?</i>

595
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:41,189
<i>Daddy?</i>

596
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,401
<i>Whatever happens...</i>

597
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:46,694
<i>tell Will...</i>

598
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:57,330
The message is two days old.

599
00:56:58,873 --> 00:57:00,083
I'm gonna call Paula.

600
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,223
Will?

601
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:22,897
-Where the hell are they coming from?
-I don't know.

602
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:30,947
Jesus Christ.

603
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:45,962
-Jesus. We should turn around.
-This road's the only way over the pass.

604
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:48,590
Oh, shit!

605
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:18,745
-This is a mistake. Why are we stopping?
-I just want to see what's going on.

606
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:24,334
-You OK, lady? What happened?
-I need help.

607
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:26,377
I... I have a flat.

608
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:29,047
OK, why don't you just come to us.
It's safer over here.

609
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:31,007
-No, no.
-OK, OK.

610
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:34,093
You just need to get in the car.
It's safer in the car. Come on, come on.

611
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:37,347
-I just need help.
-Where's your spare? Is it in the car?

612
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:39,057
I don't know. I don't know.

613
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:41,226
-All right. Come on, Ricki.
-I can't.

614
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:44,812
I can't. I don't know how.
I need help.

615
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:47,524
Yeah. It's right here.

616
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:49,275
Help me.

617
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:53,154
-Should be right here.
-Right.

618
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:54,113
Hey, hands up!

619
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:56,533
Whoa, whoa!

620
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:58,201
We just want the gas.

621
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:01,162
-You happy? You happy now?
-Go get it.

622
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:02,288
Shut the fuck up!

623
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,290
-What the fuck is he doing?
-It's not personal.

624
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:06,626
-We all got places to be.
-Stay calm.

625
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,920
Stay calm, all right? Stay calm.

626
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:10,672
-Hurry up, now.
-It's locked.

627
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:12,674
-Open it.
-It's locked and I don't have the key.

628
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:15,843
-You got anything?
-Bingo!

629
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:18,096
-No!
-Hey!

630
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:29,190
Don't. Don't fucking do it, man.

631
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:31,901
Fill it. Fill it!

632
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:35,655
-Just leave us one canister, please.
-Shut your fucking mouth.

633
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:38,032
-Jesus Christ!
-Tom, you all right?

634
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:41,119
Tom! You OK?

635
00:59:41,202 --> 00:59:43,371
Get the gas.
Let's get the hell out of here.

636
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:46,040
Just get the gas. Let's fucking go, man.

637
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:48,126
-Leave us one can, man. Please.
-Hurry!

638
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:50,545
Don't leave us here to die.

639
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:52,922
-Let's fucking go.
-You're killing us. Don't take the gas!

640
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:55,967
Jesus Christ. You OK?

641
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:59,429
-My ribs. Couldn't lift my gun.
-Fuck!

642
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:01,222
-Fuck!
-Shame on you.

643
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:03,308
-All of you.
-You fucking helped them!

644
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:07,103
-All right. Come on, get in the car.
-Why'd you stop?

645
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:10,315
-We're supposed to be decent.
-Get in the car. We have to go right now!

646
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:14,861
I'm staying with him. I'm not leaving
my husband like this. Not with you people!

647
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:17,280
We gotta go. If we don't catch them,
we're dead. Come on, go.

648
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:23,369
-Come on, get in the car!
-Let's go, Will. Can't lose them.

649
01:00:34,672 --> 01:00:35,882
They can't be far.

650
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,560
Come on! Come on, damn it.

651
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:06,329
Fuck!

652
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:08,122
Hold on!

653
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:11,000
Holy fuck.

654
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:18,675
Hold on!

655
01:01:21,427 --> 01:01:22,553
Come on!

656
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:28,059
-Will...
-Holy fuck!

657
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:32,105
-You know how to use this?
-Yeah.

658
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:33,189
Take it.

659
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:37,318
Make it count!

660
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:40,488
Shoot!

661
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:43,825
Hold on! Here we go.

662
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:45,702
Shoot!

663
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:47,453
Shoot, Ricki!

664
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:48,663
Shoot! Shoot!

665
01:01:50,623 --> 01:01:51,582
Do it!

666
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:53,543
Shoot the tire!  Shoot.

667
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:55,586
You got it.

668
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:58,381
You go it. Shoot the tire, Ricki!

669
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:17,608
Get the gas!

670
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:20,695
I'll get them.

671
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:25,450
-Get it!
-No.

672
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:27,493
I can't!

673
01:02:29,662 --> 01:02:30,747
Get off!

674
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,877
-I can't open it!
-Let go of me!

675
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:38,588
-Come on, Ricki. Come on. Damn it!
-I can't! He's holding it.

676
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:40,131
-Come on!
-Let go!

677
01:02:40,214 --> 01:02:41,924
We're running out of time.
Go, go. Come on!

678
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:45,219
Come on. Let's go.

679
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:46,429
Let's go. Come on!

680
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:47,972
Go, go, go. Pull over.

681
01:03:33,434 --> 01:03:35,895
-I can't pull over here, Ricki.
-I said pull over.

682
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:37,855
-I said pull over!
-OK, OK.

683
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:51,327
Fuck!

684
01:03:52,578 --> 01:03:54,121
I fucking killed them!

685
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:56,123
They robbed us, Ricki.
They were gonna kill us.

686
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:58,376
You saved us. That's the truth.

687
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:01,462
-You did a good thing.
-Yeah? For what?

688
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:04,215
So I can do this all over again?

689
01:04:04,298 --> 01:04:07,301
It's another fucking
thousand miles to Seattle. -It's OK. It's OK.
-I'm not gonna shoot you!

690
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:14,559
I shouldn't have fucking come.

691
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:18,896
I'd rather go back to the fucking rez
than spend another minute here with you.

692
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:20,773
We're in the middle of fucking nowhere.

693
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:22,942
You think that I wouldn't make it?

694
01:04:24,151 --> 01:04:27,864
Who do you think's been taking care of me
since the day that I was born?

695
01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:36,706
We'll survive this longer than you.

696
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:39,500
Fuck!

697
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:43,212
-Fuck both you guys.
-Ricki, OK, let's just take a...

698
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:46,257
We're gonna take a second, all right?
And we're gonna rest here.

699
01:04:58,185 --> 01:04:59,020
Ricki?

700
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:01,814
You saved us. Remember that.

701
01:05:02,523 --> 01:05:03,858
I am...

702
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:19,248
Let's just give her a minute.

703
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:58,204
Ricki?

704
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:13,594
Ricki!

705
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:26,190
Tom.

706
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:27,566
Wake up.

707
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:30,903
Ricki's gone. She left.

708
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:33,614
What?

709
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:35,032
She took her stuff.

710
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:37,368
-You sure?
-Yeah.

711
01:06:37,868 --> 01:06:39,036
Maybe she'll be safer.

712
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:45,876
Should never have asked her
to come with us.

713
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:27,668
-Up ahead.
-Yeah.

714
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:28,961
There.

715
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:30,838
Goddamn.

716
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:36,302
Jesus.

717
01:07:40,514 --> 01:07:41,766
Let's just check for gas.

718
01:08:56,257 --> 01:08:58,050
-What's going on, Tom?
-I can't breathe.

719
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:01,679
-All right. Let's get some help right now.
-No time. My lungs are collapsing.

720
01:09:01,762 --> 01:09:04,348
-Gotta let the pressure out.
-OK. How, how would--

721
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:07,059
-What you want me to do?
-Put it in.

722
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:08,727
-Where?
-Put it--

723
01:09:09,186 --> 01:09:10,437
-Put in it.
-OK, OK.

724
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,565
-OK.
-All the way in.

725
01:09:22,616 --> 01:09:23,450
OK.

726
01:09:24,368 --> 01:09:25,244
OK.

727
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:11,790
Sam told me that...

728
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:17,087
your father left you.
That's ugly.

729
01:10:19,131 --> 01:10:20,758
And you were just a kid, right?

730
01:10:23,427 --> 01:10:24,428
Yeah.

731
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:26,430
Yeah.

732
01:10:27,514 --> 01:10:28,724
And your old man...

733
01:10:30,851 --> 01:10:33,312
he's... he's all right, right?

734
01:10:35,147 --> 01:10:38,943
I guess. He lives in Idaho now
with his new family. I see him...

735
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:41,528
once every couple years.

736
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:46,492
It's a shame that you never
got to meet my father.

737
01:10:50,704 --> 01:10:53,082
Sam must have told you
some stories about him.

738
01:10:53,582 --> 01:10:54,833
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

739
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:56,794
You know,

740
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,004
if you think I'm bad,

741
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:00,965
then...

742
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:03,175
forget it.

743
01:11:05,761 --> 01:11:08,472
He had this... had this look,

744
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:10,766
when he thought you crossed the line.

745
01:11:12,726 --> 01:11:14,728
He'd just stare at you.

746
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:19,858
It wasn't in disappointment, you know?

747
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:22,611
No. It was...

748
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:27,950
'cause he was disgusted at the fact
that he brought you into the world.

749
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,167
He was a shitty father.

750
01:11:41,005 --> 01:11:43,007
I mean, in his heart, he was a good man.

751
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:51,181
I don't know if I'm a good father.

752
01:11:53,225 --> 01:11:54,101
I try.

753
01:11:58,272 --> 01:11:59,773
You know I love your daughter.

754
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:02,693
Yeah.

755
01:12:05,362 --> 01:12:06,196
I know.

756
01:12:07,614 --> 01:12:09,533
I know you do, yeah.

757
01:12:10,701 --> 01:12:13,579
If I didn't think that,
I would have killed you a long time ago.

758
01:12:21,253 --> 01:12:22,713
You'll be on your own soon.

759
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:26,508
Yeah.

760
01:12:28,635 --> 01:12:31,055
I need to ask your word on something.

761
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:34,350
Yeah, of course, anything.
Whatever you want.

762
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:37,144
I need you to promise

763
01:12:38,062 --> 01:12:41,273
that you'll always keep her safe.

764
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:44,693
Tom...

765
01:12:46,987 --> 01:12:48,614
of course I will. I promise you.

766
01:12:49,907 --> 01:12:51,283
I promise you.

767
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:03,629
You know...

768
01:13:05,964 --> 01:13:07,841
there's something I need to tell you.

769
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:09,343
Nah. I know.

770
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:14,640
No, no. You don't know this, Tom.
No, you don't know.

771
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:19,269
Sam's pregnant.

772
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:21,438
I know.

773
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:23,774
What?

774
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:25,859
What do you mean you know?
How'd you know?

775
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:28,987
Paula, she called her after our dinner,

776
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:31,323
and Sam told her everything.

777
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:34,326
Said that you're having a baby boy!

778
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:43,001
-So, all this time you...
-Yeah.

779
01:13:44,378 --> 01:13:45,212
All this...

780
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:48,132
You fuck.

781
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:53,720
You know, I...

782
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:57,015
I got to tell you something else, too.

783
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:01,061
I got to tell you about the boat.

784
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:04,773
Seriously? You know, why don't you quit
while you're ahead on this.

785
01:14:09,361 --> 01:14:11,113
You know all that shit you gave me,

786
01:14:11,905 --> 01:14:13,323
over the last six years?

787
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:16,452
The really funny thing is you...

788
01:14:17,744 --> 01:14:21,331
you think it was me that was driving
that boat when it crashed into the rock.

789
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:24,543
-Get out! It was Sam?
-Yeah. Hell, yeah.

790
01:14:27,588 --> 01:14:29,423
She was drunk. I mean,

791
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:33,010
drunk as anything. I mean,
we both were and...

792
01:14:33,927 --> 01:14:36,054
you know, when we came down
in the morning,

793
01:14:37,097 --> 01:14:40,350
and we see the boat, it had sunk to
the bottom of the fucking lake, I mean...

794
01:14:42,561 --> 01:14:43,979
I don't know, I just...

795
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:47,107
I thought it was the right thing to do,
you know

796
01:14:49,234 --> 01:14:50,068
Say it was me.

797
01:14:52,362 --> 01:14:53,530
Sam still doesn't know.

798
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:57,242
You're a good man.

799
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:01,288
You're gonna be a good father.

800
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:05,459
Yeah.

801
01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:28,190
She's gonna be fine, Tom.

802
01:15:30,275 --> 01:15:31,443
She's gonna be fine.

803
01:15:42,579 --> 01:15:44,206
Maybe we can get some help here.

804
01:16:05,519 --> 01:16:08,814
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

805
01:16:16,154 --> 01:16:19,491
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

806
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:34,756
Fuck.

807
01:16:41,221 --> 01:16:42,431
-Take it slow.
-Yeah.

808
01:16:48,854 --> 01:16:50,105
We need to get past.

809
01:16:50,814 --> 01:16:52,858
My friend is sick. He needs a doctor.

810
01:17:00,407 --> 01:17:01,241
We have money.

811
01:17:02,743 --> 01:17:03,744
Bring the car here.

812
01:17:04,328 --> 01:17:05,287
We'll get you help.

813
01:17:07,247 --> 01:17:09,333
All right, we're coming.
Just don't shoot.

814
01:17:14,254 --> 01:17:15,213
What are you doing?

815
01:17:15,589 --> 01:17:19,009
-Wait, we can't go over there.
-Yeah, no shit, Tom.

816
01:17:37,444 --> 01:17:38,528
Ah, fuck.

817
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:51,750
Grab the gun, Will.

818
01:17:58,006 --> 01:17:58,882
Good job. Fuck!

819
01:18:14,272 --> 01:18:15,899
Good. You did good.

820
01:18:18,068 --> 01:18:19,569
They're coming from both ways.

821
01:18:21,196 --> 01:18:22,197
Turn around!

822
01:18:39,756 --> 01:18:40,882
Give me the gun, Will.

823
01:18:44,302 --> 01:18:47,556
When I say three,
I want you to swerve to your left.

824
01:18:53,019 --> 01:18:55,731
One... two... three!

825
01:19:10,078 --> 01:19:11,371
Oh, shit, Tom.

826
01:19:21,673 --> 01:19:22,507
Tom. Tom?

827
01:20:48,051 --> 01:20:49,511
No, no, no. Fuck!

828
01:20:50,053 --> 01:20:50,929
Come on!

829
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:54,266
Come on! No!

830
01:21:06,653 --> 01:21:08,655
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

831
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:11,575
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck, you fucking...

832
01:21:11,825 --> 01:21:12,659
Fuck!

833
01:21:13,743 --> 01:21:15,245
Fuck! Fuck.

834
01:21:15,787 --> 01:21:16,705
Fuck.

835
01:21:17,205 --> 01:21:18,081
Fuck.

836
01:21:29,968 --> 01:21:31,136
I'm sorry, Tom.

837
01:23:23,581 --> 01:23:24,833
Hey, hey!

838
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:44,853
Where you going?

839
01:23:45,687 --> 01:23:47,814
I'm going west, trying to get to Seattle.

840
01:23:49,107 --> 01:23:50,025
We're going north.

841
01:23:53,987 --> 01:23:56,614
We've been staying off the interstate.
It's not safe.

842
01:23:56,698 --> 01:23:57,699
Yeah, I know.

843
01:24:03,204 --> 01:24:04,956
All right, we'll take you
as far as we can.

844
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:06,666
-OK.
-I'm gonna need that.

845
01:24:09,127 --> 01:24:10,336
I got family in the car.

846
01:24:17,177 --> 01:24:18,011
OK. OK.

847
01:24:20,430 --> 01:24:21,556
Easy.

848
01:24:25,685 --> 01:24:26,519
All right.

849
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:58,093
<i>This message is being broadcast...</i>

850
01:25:02,972 --> 01:25:04,849
This message is being broadcast...

851
01:25:10,146 --> 01:25:10,980
Nothing.

852
01:25:14,025 --> 01:25:15,527
Do you have any idea what happened?

853
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:17,320
We still don't know.

854
01:25:17,904 --> 01:25:20,323
Started in Los Angeles.
Or at least...

855
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,034
what it was.

856
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:27,330
They're saying go to Canada.
Something about the air.

857
01:25:29,666 --> 01:25:32,418
-It's been three days now?
-No. Today's day five.

858
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:37,590
I'm guessing you haven't slept.

859
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,009
Yeah, you and me both.

860
01:25:49,644 --> 01:25:50,979
You should take this exit.

861
01:26:20,425 --> 01:26:21,342
Hello!

862
01:26:26,097 --> 01:26:26,973
Come on.

863
01:26:32,854 --> 01:26:33,771
Hello? Dad?

864
01:26:45,575 --> 01:26:46,618
You sure this is OK?

865
01:26:48,494 --> 01:26:50,455
Yeah, yeah. It's my father's place.

866
01:26:52,457 --> 01:26:54,792
There's bedrooms upstairs
if you want to rest.

867
01:26:54,876 --> 01:26:57,962
And hopefully there's some food
in the kitchen, take a look.

868
01:27:00,882 --> 01:27:01,925
All right, thank you.

869
01:27:02,842 --> 01:27:03,676
Yeah.

870
01:27:46,552 --> 01:27:47,679
Well, they're asleep.

871
01:27:49,389 --> 01:27:50,598
Look, I just want to say

872
01:27:51,474 --> 01:27:52,809
we really appreciate this.

873
01:27:57,105 --> 01:27:59,941
There's about three weeks of food here.

874
01:28:01,192 --> 01:28:04,612
Generator last will you five days,
maybe more if you're conservative.

875
01:28:05,738 --> 01:28:08,908
There's one car in the garage,
but I had to siphon off most of the gas.

876
01:28:08,992 --> 01:28:11,703
But if you look around,
you're gonna find enough to get north.

877
01:28:12,829 --> 01:28:14,330
But I need to leave right now. And I need a four-wheel drive.

878
01:28:18,418 --> 01:28:20,295
Which means I need to take your Jeep.

879
01:28:21,629 --> 01:28:23,339
That's the deal that I'm offering.

880
01:28:29,846 --> 01:28:30,847
Sure. Yeah.

881
01:28:41,024 --> 01:28:41,858
Shit. You're alive.

882
01:33:38,654 --> 01:33:39,488
Hello?

883
01:33:41,699 --> 01:33:43,367
-This is private property!
-Will!

884
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:45,494
-Will. Oh, my God!
-Sam!

885
01:33:45,911 --> 01:33:46,746
Will

886
01:33:46,912 --> 01:33:49,415
He's our neighbor, Will.
Put your guns down!

887
01:33:52,585 --> 01:33:53,502
Will.

888
01:33:54,378 --> 01:33:55,212
You're OK.

889
01:33:55,713 --> 01:33:56,839
-You're OK.
-I'm OK.

890
01:33:58,007 --> 01:33:59,717
We're OK, Will.

891
01:34:00,843 --> 01:34:01,677
You're alive.

892
01:34:02,511 --> 01:34:03,387
You're alive.

893
01:34:03,846 --> 01:34:05,598
-I can't believe it.
-The baby's OK.

894
01:34:06,807 --> 01:34:09,226
Oh, God. You're alive.

895
01:34:19,528 --> 01:34:22,448
-Come here. Please, come here.
-I'm here.

896
01:34:23,157 --> 01:34:24,075
Come here.

897
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:33,250
You know, I wouldn't have made it
without him.

898
01:34:33,709 --> 01:34:34,710
I wouldn't be alive.

899
01:34:37,463 --> 01:34:39,590
And I did everything I could.
I did everything.

900
01:34:39,674 --> 01:34:40,800
I know, baby.

901
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:43,552
I know you did.

902
01:34:49,058 --> 01:34:50,685
I'm never gonna leave you again.

903
01:35:07,535 --> 01:35:08,369
I love you. -Hey.
-Hey.

904
01:36:03,215 --> 01:36:04,425
-Hi.
-Hi.

905
01:36:04,967 --> 01:36:05,968
Hi.

906
01:36:11,307 --> 01:36:13,893
You know, when I saw Seattle,
I didn't think that...

907
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:17,521
Just thank you.

908
01:36:19,648 --> 01:36:20,816
What are neighbors for?

909
01:36:24,612 --> 01:36:26,280
You... You want one?

910
01:36:26,989 --> 01:36:27,823
Yeah, sure. Thank you.

911
01:36:39,794 --> 01:36:41,045
It all happened so fast.

912
01:36:41,712 --> 01:36:42,797
Yeah, it was maybe...

913
01:36:43,798 --> 01:36:45,007
ten, fifteen minutes

914
01:36:45,090 --> 01:36:48,260
before the police were just yelling
at everybody to evacuate.

915
01:36:48,886 --> 01:36:50,471
I mean, you could see the Sound

916
01:36:50,679 --> 01:36:53,182
and the water retreat. I've never seen
anything like that before.

917
01:36:53,682 --> 01:36:56,101
We were a couple miles inland
by the time the waves hit.

918
01:36:57,144 --> 01:36:58,062
You could hear it.

919
01:36:58,395 --> 01:36:59,605
-It was horrible.
-Yeah.

920
01:36:59,897 --> 01:37:01,357
And just so you know, Will...

921
01:37:03,234 --> 01:37:05,110
I don't think this was an earthquake.

922
01:37:06,278 --> 01:37:07,530
I'm a software engineer.

923
01:37:08,113 --> 01:37:10,533
I've seen tons of war games simulations,

924
01:37:10,699 --> 01:37:13,285
including this exact scenario.

925
01:37:14,453 --> 01:37:15,746
Events just like this.

926
01:37:16,455 --> 01:37:17,373
They're designed

927
01:37:18,290 --> 01:37:21,752
to erase rational behavior with what
appears to be a singular incident.

928
01:37:23,337 --> 01:37:24,171
But really...

929
01:37:25,047 --> 01:37:26,173
it's all synchronized.

930
01:37:26,674 --> 01:37:28,008
What the fuck you talking about?

931
01:37:28,884 --> 01:37:29,718
Will...

932
01:37:30,636 --> 01:37:33,264
-Look, I'm not trying to upset you.
-You're not upsetting me.

933
01:37:34,139 --> 01:37:34,974
Good.

934
01:37:36,934 --> 01:37:39,436
I know the last couple days
have been rough on you.

935
01:37:47,945 --> 01:37:50,698
I mean, come on, you don't really believe
this bullshit, do you?

936
01:37:51,198 --> 01:37:52,199
This is not...

937
01:37:52,658 --> 01:37:56,620
I just drove across the fucking country.
You can't create things that I've seen.

938
01:37:57,663 --> 01:38:00,207
-Seriously, are you fucking with me?
-No, I'm not fucking with you.

939
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:03,752
Think about it in laymen's terms.
A nuclear bomb goes off the coast.

940
01:38:04,086 --> 01:38:08,465
Then a virus takes down the grid before
anyone can figure out what happened.

941
01:38:11,802 --> 01:38:14,513
-I've seen the intel.
-You haven't seen it. There is no intel.

942
01:38:14,597 --> 01:38:17,808
-That is fucking bullshit.
-The bomb plays like an earthquake.

943
01:38:17,892 --> 01:38:19,810
That's what causes the waves.

944
01:38:20,561 --> 01:38:21,604
Yeah?

945
01:38:21,896 --> 01:38:24,273
But the power going out,
that created the chaos.

946
01:38:25,524 --> 01:38:27,359
Don't you think it's strange that...

947
01:38:28,485 --> 01:38:30,237
the power just went out everywhere?

948
01:38:32,156 --> 01:38:35,159
The communications? I mean,
just fucking think about it, man.

949
01:38:37,369 --> 01:38:40,831
Unless, I don't know, I don't know.
Maybe he believes in coincidences.

950
01:38:44,001 --> 01:38:44,835
Baby?

951
01:38:46,045 --> 01:38:47,421
Baby, come on.

952
01:38:49,173 --> 01:38:50,007
You need sleep.

953
01:38:50,674 --> 01:38:52,092
I'm gonna clean up here. all right?

954
01:38:52,176 --> 01:38:54,678
And we can talk about all this
in the morning, all right?

955
01:38:54,762 --> 01:38:57,389
When you've had a good rest
and you're feeling better, OK?

956
01:38:57,973 --> 01:38:58,807
Come on.

957
01:39:00,935 --> 01:39:04,146
You know, there was an ash cloud
over the ocean.

958
01:39:05,147 --> 01:39:06,398
Seattle is gone,

959
01:39:07,316 --> 01:39:08,943
God knows how many other cities.

960
01:39:09,944 --> 01:39:12,279
I don't know what the fuck is going on,

961
01:39:12,529 --> 01:39:15,324
and you do not know what the fuck
is going on either.

962
01:39:15,407 --> 01:39:17,076
So, let's not pretend that you do, OK?

963
01:39:19,870 --> 01:39:20,704
OK.

964
01:39:27,086 --> 01:39:28,545
They happen all the time now.

965
01:39:31,548 --> 01:39:32,383
Yeah.

966
01:39:34,301 --> 01:39:36,428
Well, in the end,
it doesn't really matter, I guess.

967
01:39:37,179 --> 01:39:38,013
Why?

968
01:39:39,431 --> 01:39:40,557
We all have to live, right?

969
01:39:41,725 --> 01:39:42,559
No matter what.

970
01:39:43,686 --> 01:39:44,645
I'll drink to that.

971
01:39:47,856 --> 01:39:49,400
Come on. Let's go.

972
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:50,901
Hey, can I...

973
01:39:51,568 --> 01:39:52,987
Can I see that SIG of yours?

974
01:39:57,199 --> 01:39:58,033
Sure. It's nice.

975
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:17,011
Be nicer with bullets, though, right?

976
01:40:18,887 --> 01:40:19,805
Good night.

977
01:40:23,308 --> 01:40:24,518
-Good night.
-Good night.

978
01:40:32,901 --> 01:40:34,737
I know he helped you,
but he just...

979
01:40:35,988 --> 01:40:39,074
Tell me you don't believe
that bullshit that he's telling you?

980
01:40:39,241 --> 01:40:40,117
I don't.

981
01:40:47,374 --> 01:40:48,417
You and the baby...

982
01:40:49,835 --> 01:40:51,545
are the only thing that matters.

983
01:40:54,673 --> 01:40:55,591
The only thing.

984
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:14,962
-Hey.
-Hey.

985
01:42:17,798 --> 01:42:18,757
You seeing this?

986
01:42:19,925 --> 01:42:21,426
Still think it's a simulation?

987
01:42:24,096 --> 01:42:25,013
No.

988
01:42:27,641 --> 01:42:28,976
I owe you an apo--

989
01:42:31,228 --> 01:42:32,688
I let the whiskey do the talking.

990
01:42:34,106 --> 01:42:38,360
I guess I just convinced myself that
that would put me more in control, but...

991
01:42:40,028 --> 01:42:41,655
It doesn't make me crazy, right?

992
01:42:44,491 --> 01:42:46,368
Why were you looking in my car
this morning?

993
01:42:49,913 --> 01:42:52,666
I wasn't trying to steal your car, Will,
if that's what you're after.

994
01:42:54,209 --> 01:42:55,460
You planning on leaving?

995
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:57,629
By myself, no.

996
01:43:01,216 --> 01:43:02,718
But we've got supplies here.

997
01:43:09,391 --> 01:43:12,853
I saw two kids. I thought that maybe
they took something from your car.

998
01:43:13,562 --> 01:43:14,813
Saw two kids. Right.

999
01:43:19,234 --> 01:43:20,694
Where are these kids right now?

1000
01:43:22,237 --> 01:43:23,363
They're in the woods.

1001
01:43:25,490 --> 01:43:27,993
I've been running a perimeter
every morning since we got here.

1002
01:43:30,829 --> 01:43:32,331
Come with me, I'll show you.

1003
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:53,101
Must be a volcano around here.

1004
01:43:53,685 --> 01:43:54,770
Don't worry about it.

1005
01:44:15,540 --> 01:44:16,375
We're leaving.

1006
01:44:17,417 --> 01:44:19,378
Unless you want to stay,
you should come with us.

1007
01:44:21,546 --> 01:44:22,589
It's not safe here.

1008
01:44:23,924 --> 01:44:24,925
Where are you going?

1009
01:44:25,592 --> 01:44:26,426
North.

1010
01:44:35,060 --> 01:44:36,270
She wants to stay, Will.

1011
01:44:41,566 --> 01:44:43,151
I don't see any kids out here.

1012
01:44:48,824 --> 01:44:50,367
I'm not the boogie man, Will.

1013
01:44:51,910 --> 01:44:53,287
Remember, I saved her life.

1014
01:44:54,663 --> 01:44:57,291
We have a bond. That means I get a voice.

1015
01:44:59,793 --> 01:45:00,877
We thought you were dead.

1016
01:45:01,795 --> 01:45:03,964
Well, I'm not, am I?
I'm here.

1017
01:45:06,925 --> 01:45:08,385
You know she's pregnant, right?

1018
01:45:15,392 --> 01:45:16,727
You don't have to do this.

1019
01:45:23,150 --> 01:45:24,234
I do.

1020
01:45:52,179 --> 01:45:53,013
Sam! Sam!

1021
01:45:56,433 --> 01:45:58,352
-What's happening?
-Something's coming.

1022
01:45:58,435 --> 01:46:00,020
-We have to go right now.
-What?

1023
01:46:00,103 --> 01:46:01,480
Go... Go where?

1024
01:46:01,772 --> 01:46:05,484
-OK. OK. Where's Jeremiah?
-He tried to kill me. Come on.

1025
01:46:05,859 --> 01:46:07,027
-We've got to go.
-What?

1026
01:46:08,987 --> 01:46:09,821
OK.

1027
01:46:10,238 --> 01:46:11,073
OK.

1028
01:46:23,043 --> 01:46:25,212
-What is it?
-It's happening again.

1029
01:46:32,511 --> 01:46:33,512
Oh, God!

1030
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:39,351
It's getting closer.

1031
01:46:41,186 --> 01:46:44,189
We're gonna make it. No matter
what happens, we're gonna make it, OK?

1032
01:46:51,154 --> 01:46:52,697
Look at me, OK? Look at me.

1033
01:46:53,323 --> 01:46:55,283
-It's gonna be OK.
-I know.
