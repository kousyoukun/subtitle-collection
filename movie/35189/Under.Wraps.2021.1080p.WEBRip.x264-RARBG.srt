Your parents wanted you
in bed by 10:00.

No way.

I saw a monster outside
my window last night.

Aren't you a little old

to still believe
in monsters?

It was big and ugly,

all over its face.

Well, there's nothing
over here.

21

Now I have to go back again
to see how it ends.

How can you stand movies
like that?

41

Getting scared is what makes
horror movies fun.

being scared?

Marsh, I don't need to be
scared to enjoy it.

47
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:06,460
The Halloween carnival
isn't scary.

48
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:08,562
That's because you never do
the haunted houses.

49
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:10,531
And last year you spent
the entire night

50
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:13,033
just dumping money on
that stupid ring toss game.

51
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:15,436
I was trying to win
the purple-eyed panda.

Why are you so obsessed

54
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,207
with that purple-eyed
panda anyway?

55
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,474
Okay.

56
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:22,510
Five years ago, I won one
while we were on vacation,

57
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,178
but it wouldn't fit
in the car

58
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:26,414
so we had to
leave it behind.

It was the biggest tragedy
of my childhood.

00:07:03,691 --> 00:07:04,525
Later.

185
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,096
So Marshall.

186
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:10,998
How long have you been
into scary movies?

187
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:12,466
Years.

188
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,967
You should see his room.

189
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,303
It is practically
a museum of macabre.

190
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,105
Maybe you could show it
to me after dinner.

191
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:19,773
I have a lot of homework.

192
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:23,744
If you love horror stuff
you must love Halloween.

193
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:25,145
I don't know,

194
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,080
maybe we could carve up
some jack-o'-lanterns.

195
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:28,549
Oh, that's a great idea.

196
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:30,317
That's little kid stuff.

197
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,252
Besides, I have a lot
of homework.

198
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:33,487
May I be excused?

199
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,089
Okay, but...

200
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:38,358
[sighs]

201
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:41,795
Don't worry.

202
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:43,296
Sometimes kids just
need time to adjust.

203
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:47,034
I, uh, I'll be right back.

204
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,304
[door slam]

205
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:57,077
[knocking]

206
00:07:57,745 --> 00:07:59,179
Marshall.

207
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:06,887
Ted is a really,
really nice man.

208
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:09,623
He makes me happy.

209
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:12,359
And I think you'd like him
if you gave him a chance.

210
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,927
It's too soon.

211
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,400
Your dad and I have been
divorced for five years.

212
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:22,269
I need to move on
with my life.

213
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:24,605
We both do.

214
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,775
Why?

215
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:30,578
I mean, we're doing
just fine on our own.

216
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:32,412
My relationship with Ted

217
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:34,181
won't change anything
between us.

218
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:37,517
I will still love you
more than anyone else

219
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:40,020
in the whole world.

220
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:41,421
You know that, right?

221
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:43,356
I guess.

222
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:46,393
I need you to keep an open
mind about this.

223
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:48,428
Please.

224
00:09:00,608 --> 00:09:02,643
Gilbert: Marshall,
are you there? Over.

225
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:04,978
What is it Gilbert? Over.

226
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:06,814
Check out what's up
at Kubot's.

227
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,484
So, they're moving stuff.

228
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,988
Gilbert: What is that thing?

229
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:16,724
I don't know, maybe
it's some furniture.

230
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:18,659
My mom said he's
an antique importer.

231
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:21,394
What antique is shaped like
a dead body?

232
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:23,330
Let's see.
Could be an iron maiden

233
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:26,199
to torment his victims,
or an ancient alien robot.

234
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,335
Or, and I'm just
spit-balling here,

235
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:31,705
it's a big weird old statue
for his big weird old house.

236
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,541
Okay. But I think
he's up to something.

237
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:36,009
Something scary.

238
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:37,110
Whatever, Gil.

239
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:38,278
Over and out.

240
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,181
Hmm.

241
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,651
*

242
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,155
Okay now students,
we're not just here

243
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:50,658
to eat gift shop
astronaut ice cream.

244
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,726
We're here for Egyptian
history class

245
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,962
and this will be
on the test.

246
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,529
[students groan]

247
00:09:56,664 --> 00:09:58,065
Miss Pratt:
Music to my ears.

248
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:00,133
We're going by the buddy system

249
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,169
while we're here today,
so pick a buddy.

250
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:04,137
Miss Pratt: Two by two,
come on.

251
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:08,942
Miss Pratt?

252
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:10,210
There's no one left
to buddy with.

253
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:11,544
Oh, um...

254
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,113
Gilbert and Marshall.

255
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:14,982
Miss Pratt: Amy will be
with you two.

256
00:10:16,784 --> 00:10:17,885
Go on.

257
00:10:19,887 --> 00:10:21,922
Ms. Pratt: I'm going
to go find our docent.

258
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:24,758
Wait here and please
behave yourselves.

259
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,865
So you're the new girl,
right?

260
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:33,300
I'm Amy.

261
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:34,702
I moved from Rockport

262
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:36,670
with my dad and my Step-Dave
over the summer.

263
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:38,271
Wait. What?

264
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:41,174
My two dads split up
a few years ago.

265
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,877
Pop lives back in Rockport
and Dad married Step-Dave.

266
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:45,112
Anyway, hi.

267
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,780
-Hi.
-Hi.

268
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:49,349
So um, how... how do you...
how do you like it here?

269
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,784
I hate it.

270
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:52,285
This town is boring

271
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:54,121
and my friends are
all back in Rockport.

272
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:55,789
How exciting do you
need it to be?

273
00:10:55,923 --> 00:10:57,624
I'm going to be an
investigative journalist.

274
00:10:57,758 --> 00:10:59,359
To do that, I need
to find stories.

275
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,061
To do that,

276
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:03,263
I need to be someplace
where stories happen.

277
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,332
And this is not it.

278
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:07,367
Well, who knows?

279
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,936
This place could
surprise you.

280
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:11,238
Anything's possible,
but I doubt it.

281
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:12,873
Dad and Step-Dave said
if I don't like it

282
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,441
I can go live with Pop
back in Rockport,

283
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:17,010
so next summer
I am outta here.

284
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:20,380
Dracula, huh?

285
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,249
I know everyone's batty
about Lugosi.

286
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:23,784
I much prefer
Christopher Lee.

287
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,385
I mean, Horror of Dracula?

288
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,354
Lugosi didn't even
have fangs.

289
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:28,822
Great. Another one.

290
00:11:28,956 --> 00:11:30,223
Have you seen
the new Warthead?

291
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,292
Of course.
That ending was gore-tastic.

292
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:33,861
Especially...

293
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:34,928
Oh, no spoilers.

294
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:36,596
I missed the ending.

295
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,098
You didn't stay
for the ending?

296
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:39,499
'Cause of me.

297
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,434
I had to... nope out.

298
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:42,836
Gotcha.

299
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,371
Anybody want Skidoodles?

300
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:45,638
-I do.
-Give it back.

301
00:11:45,773 --> 00:11:47,574
Permission slip said
no snacks.

302
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,376
I'm helping you hide
the evidence.

303
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:52,746
That's Todd.

304
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,914
In third grade,

305
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,048
Marshall accidentally
knocked him over

306
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:56,183
into his own birthday cake.

307
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:57,818
[chuckles]

308
00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:59,619
-It was hilarious.
-I see, uh...

309
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:00,954
No. No.

310
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:02,422
Excuse me for a moment.

311
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,425
Hi, I'm Amy.
You're Todd, right?

312
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,559
Yup.

313
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:08,261
I see you've decided
to hang out with me

314
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,764
instead of those
two weirdos. Smart.

315
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:13,133
Thanks, Todd.
Anyway, I just wanted to see

316
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:15,002
-if you were feeling okay.
-Why wouldn't I?

317
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:16,703
-Maltitol.
-Mult...

318
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:19,239
Oh, I guess you didn't see
the most recent news reports.

319
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:20,373
It's a sugar substitute,

320
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:22,642
but it has its...
side effects.

321
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:23,811
What?

322
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:25,946
If you haven't built up
a tolerance to it...

323
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,082
Well, I hope your parents are
stocked up on toilet paper.

324
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:30,884
You'll be... busy.

325
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,486
How busy?

326
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,958
It only takes a few seconds
before... boom.

327
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:41,061
Excuse me, I need
to find a bathroom.

328
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:43,230
Bathroom, bathroom, bathroom,
bathroom, bathroom!

329
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:44,832
[Amy laughs]

330
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:46,433
Okay. That was amazing.

331
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:48,902
Your candy is safe
from now on.

332
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:53,941
Welcome to the Secrets of
the Egyptian Tomb exhibit.

333
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,444
Right this way.

334
00:12:57,577 --> 00:12:59,346
This solid stone container

335
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:01,982
is something the ancient
Egyptians used

336
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,984
to place the dead in.

337
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,418
Does anyone know
what it's called?

338
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:06,987
A sarcophagus?

339
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,588
Excellent.

340
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,257
A sarcophagus is
a protective shell.

341
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,793
Inside, it holds a wooden coffin
with the mummy.

342
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:15,929
Is there a real mummy
in there?

343
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:17,597
No. I'm afraid not,

344
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,600
because it's right
over here.

345
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,041
Way cool.

346
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:29,509
As you can see,

347
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,145
this coffin has a lot
of bling.

348
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,613
Based on that,

349
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:36,783
archaeologists deduce
that she was a princess

350
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:40,320
from 2000 BC
during the 12th Dynasty.

351
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:41,821
Any questions so far?

352
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:44,757
Don't they come alive at night
and eat people's brains?

353
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:46,293
Only in horror movies,

354
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,328
and thankfully
we're not in one.

355
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:52,532
I notice there are two
sarcophagi and two platforms,

356
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,401
but only one mummy.

357
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:56,236
Shouldn't there
be another mummy?

358
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:58,571
You are very observant.

359
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:00,473
There was a second mummy
in the tomb,

360
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:03,376
believed to be
a high priest.

361
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,412
They were in love.

362
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:07,614
But their families
were bitter rivals.

363
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:10,750
So their attendants conspired
to entomb them together

364
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:13,520
so they could be
with each other in death.

365
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:14,854
Romantic.

366
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:17,324
In a very emo-goth
kind of way.

367
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:18,625
Isn't it?

368
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:21,094
Sadly, it didn't last.

369
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:23,796
In 1925 the tomb was raided

370
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:26,599
and they were whisked away
to different museums.

371
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:28,135
Our exhibit was all set
to reunite them

372
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:30,971
for the first time
in almost a century.

373
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:34,707
But the high priest's mummy
mysteriously disappeared

374
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:36,509
on its way here.

375
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:37,610
So it was stolen?

376
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:39,079
Sadly, yes.

377
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,480
So if any of you come
across a mummy

378
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:42,815
please call our
mummy hotline.

379
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,017
[students laugh]

380
00:14:44,151 --> 00:14:45,385
Now before we move on,

381
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:47,554
we have a full-sized
reproduction

382
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:49,156
of an Egyptian coffin

383
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:51,891
if anyone would like to see
what it's like to be in one.

384
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:53,893
-Picture time.
-Yeah!

385
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:58,098
Hey Amy, come on!

386
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,466
Yeah, come on.

387
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:01,101
Uh, no thanks.
I'll wait my turn.

388
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,835
Say "mummy."

389
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,337
Both: Mummy!

390
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:05,738
[camera shutter snaps]

391
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:08,275
[school bell rings]

392
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,413
Announcement:
Attention students,

393
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:16,149
the bake sale tomorrow
will start at 9:00 am...

394
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:18,451
I can't figure her out.

395
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:20,020
I mean she seems cool,

396
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:22,255
but why is she so down
on Walgrove?

397
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:23,991
Marshall:
This is an awesome town.

398
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:26,459
Wouldn't be so awesome
if your friends
were somewhere else.

399
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:27,627
I mean, that's
gotta stink.

400
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,029
Yeah. You're right.

401
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:31,064
Hey!

402
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:33,200
Maybe we should see
if she wants to, you know,

403
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,168
hang out
with us sometime.

404
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:36,636
Thanks. I'd love to.

405
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,238
For your future reference

406
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:41,674
you two need to work
on your "quiet voices".

407
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:48,948
So... how did you know
what an esophagus was?

408
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:50,317
Sarcophagus.

409
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,619
Like I said,
I'm going to be
an investigative reporter.

410
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:54,487
So I kind of know a little
about a lot of things.

411
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:55,622
You ought to investigate

412
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:56,723
our neighbor
across the street.

413
00:15:56,856 --> 00:15:58,458
Why? What's so special
about him?

414
00:15:58,591 --> 00:15:59,492
Go ahead Marshall.

415
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,128
Tell her what we saw
last night.

416
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:02,495
It was nothing.

417
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:03,930
Are you kidding me?

418
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:05,165
Our neighbor was moving
a weird giant body

419
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,299
in a big creepy burlap sack
into his house

420
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:08,201
in the middle
of the night.

421
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:09,736
How weird and how giant?

422
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:11,604
Pretty giant.
Reasonably weird.

423
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:13,706
And you're sure
it was body shaped?

424
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,208
Marshall, you saw it too,
right?

425
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:17,244
I mean yes,
it was, but...

426
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:18,845
Well, there's only so many
things shaped like a body.

427
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,813
A body being at the top
of that list.

428
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:22,249
Giant, body-shaped.

429
00:16:22,382 --> 00:16:23,916
And did it look like it was
all floppy or was it...

430
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:25,618
Stiff as a board.

431
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:27,920
-Anthropoid coffin.
-Anthro what now?

432
00:16:28,055 --> 00:16:29,456
That's a coffin shaped like
the person inside it.

433
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:30,423
Like we saw
at the museum.

434
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:31,591
Which means?

435
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:33,960
Which means I think
you found the stolen mummy

436
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:35,362
and I found my story.

437
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,429
And you're going
to take me there.

438
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:37,897
Let's go!

439
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:40,333
Okay.

440
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:44,704
This place has crime scene
written all over it.

441
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,239
I don't think beheading
a lawn gnome

442
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:47,540
counts as a crime.

443
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:48,741
We need to get
a look at that...

444
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:49,976
whatever you saw.

445
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,644
No way. Kubot is scary
enough from a distance.

446
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:53,946
Yeah. And just because it
looked like an anthropod...

447
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:55,282
-Anthropoid?
-Whatever.

448
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:56,949
Doesn't mean
he stole the mummy.

449
00:16:57,084 --> 00:16:58,651
Oh, come on.
You guys scared?

450
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,054
You gotta face your fears.

451
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:02,622
Where have I heard
that before?

452
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:03,890
I've got to be home
for dinner.

453
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,258
I'll meet you back here
at 8:00.

454
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:06,826
We'll just sneak over and look
through the windows.

455
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,261
Everyone bring a flashlight.
Got it?

456
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:09,829
-This is not a good idea.
-I don't think we should...

457
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,030
Good.

458
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:14,067
What just happened?

459
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:15,335
I don't know.

460
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:17,670
But she is really good at
talking people into stuff.

461
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,006
Tell me about it.

462
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,008
*

463
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:28,047
Maybe we should do this
another time.

464
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:29,549
Yeah, like the daytime.

465
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,319
Or we can do it tonight.

466
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:35,054
Good idea.
Come on.

467
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:38,591
Are you sure
he's not home?

468
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:39,992
Marshall: Yes.
His car's not here
and all the lights are out.

469
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:41,928
Let's go around the back.

470
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,496
Amy: Look at all this stuff
down here.

471
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,765
This place is like
a million different
grandma attics

472
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,900
compressed into
one house.

473
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:50,937
Woah, woah, woah.
What are you doing?

474
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,505
If he really
has the coffin,

475
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,540
I have a hunch
it'll be down here.

476
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:55,508
And I have a hunch
this is a bad idea.

477
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:56,909
Let's go.

478
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,385
Okay. Let's get this
over with.

479
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:07,987
No. This is as far as
I'm going.

480
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:09,389
You two run around
in the dark

481
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:10,590
and get caught.

482
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:11,624
I'm staying here.

483
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:12,959
Come on, Marshall.

484
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:20,400
I gotta stop letting people
talk me into stuff.

485
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:23,903
[inhales]

486
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:27,574
Who's there?

487
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:32,479
[frightened gasp]

488
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,013
Hello?

489
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,255
It could be anywhere.

490
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:44,724
What is all this stuff?

491
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:48,995
[squeaking sounds]

492
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,530
[breathes shakily]

493
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:51,798
Oh.

494
00:18:55,402 --> 00:18:57,704
Oh, no!
The dead body!

495
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,411
[gasps]

496
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:06,078
Amy was right.

497
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:08,581
I wonder what's inside.

498
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:11,083
[exertion grunts]

499
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,953
This thing is heavy.

500
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:16,022
Ahhhhh!!!!!

501
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:18,057
Oh, no!

502
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:21,228
Ugh. This thing is hideous.

503
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,631
Oh, what's that?

504
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:27,534
It's shiny.

505
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,204
Ahhh!!!

506
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:33,406
[grunts]

507
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:37,810
Ahhh!!!

508
00:19:38,245 --> 00:19:39,879
Mu... mu... mummy!

509
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:06,773
Mummy...mummy...mummy!
I found the stolen mummy!

510
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:08,207
I knew it!

511
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:09,742
Marshall: How do you know
it's the stolen one?

512
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,344
How many other mummies
do you think
are in this town?

513
00:20:11,478 --> 00:20:12,879
-Okay, show us.
-Come on!

514
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:15,582
Live mummy!

515
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,018
What? It was right here
a minute ago.

516
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,321
Then I guess it just
got up and walked away.

517
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:23,222
Okay, can we get
out of he...

518
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:26,359
[groaning sounds]

519
00:20:26,493 --> 00:20:28,928
Please tell me that was
one of your stomachs.

520
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,196
No.

521
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,131
[groaning sounds]

522
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:36,002
Gilbert: What's that sound?

523
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:37,304
Amy: What is that?

524
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:39,372
Where is that sound
coming from?

525
00:20:39,506 --> 00:20:41,073
Look, there!

526
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:42,675
[all gasp]

527
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:45,177
[grumbling]

528
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:47,680
[loud roar]

529
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:50,417
Time to go now!

530
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,951
[all screaming]
Ahhhhh!!!!!

531
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,186
[all screaming]
Ahhhhh!!!!!

532
00:20:54,321 --> 00:20:55,187
Marshall: Hurry up!

533
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:56,989
[all screaming]
Ahhhhh!!!!!

534
00:20:57,123 --> 00:20:58,257
[growling]

535
00:20:58,391 --> 00:20:59,392
Gilbert: Come on!

536
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:01,628
[all screaming]
Ahhhhh!!!!!

537
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:07,734
[all screaming]
Ahhhhh!!!!!

538
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:09,001
Shut the door!

539
00:21:09,135 --> 00:21:10,136
Come on!

540
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,270
What do we do?

541
00:21:11,404 --> 00:21:12,305
We gotta hide!

542
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:13,306
In here.

543
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,707
Come on!

544
00:21:17,544 --> 00:21:18,878
Door! Door! Door!

545
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:20,179
It's locked.

546
00:21:21,314 --> 00:21:23,650
Quick, turn your
flashlights off.

547
00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:26,953
[growling]

548
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,325
No, no, no!

549
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,562
We're trapped.

550
00:21:35,695 --> 00:21:37,029
What are we going
to do?

551
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:38,598
What is going
on out there?

552
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:40,032
[screams]
Ahhh!!!

553
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,401
Quiet! Shh!

554
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:45,938
Marshall: What's happening?

555
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:48,007
I think it left.

556
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,942
[sighs]

557
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:52,078
Come on.

558
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:53,346
[loud crash]

559
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,181
[all screaming]
Ahhhhh!!!!!

560
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:01,721
-No, no, no, no!
-Please, please!

561
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:03,089
-Please.
-Please.

562
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:06,092
[grumbling]

563
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,896
I think it wants to give
you your flashlight back.

564
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:11,230
It's okay,
he can keep it.

565
00:22:11,364 --> 00:22:12,231
No, take it.

566
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:13,733
You don't want
to offend him.

567
00:22:16,436 --> 00:22:17,637
Thank you?

568
00:22:17,904 --> 00:22:19,506
[grumbling]

569
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:21,107
Mummies are supposed
to be dead.

570
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,509
How come he's moving?

571
00:22:22,642 --> 00:22:24,210
He came back to life when
you opened his esophagus.

572
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,445
Sarcophagus!

573
00:22:25,578 --> 00:22:27,179
And it wasn't a sarcophagus,
it was a coffin.

574
00:22:27,313 --> 00:22:29,148
The princess coffin
at the museum was open,

575
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:30,650
and unless she's
just real sleepy,

576
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:31,984
she didn't
come back to life.

577
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:34,286
Let's deal with this on
a mummy-by-mummy basis.

578
00:22:36,623 --> 00:22:37,724
[groans curiously]

579
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:40,059
I wouldn't!

580
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,761
Are you crazy?
It could bite.

581
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:43,796
I'm sure he doesn't
mean us any harm.

582
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,331
He's probably
just really confused.

583
00:22:45,465 --> 00:22:46,599
It's a live mummy.

584
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:47,967
You'd be that way too
if someone woke you up

585
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,769
from a 4,000-year nap.

586
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:51,203
Just be careful.

587
00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:52,439
[grunting]

588
00:22:52,572 --> 00:22:54,707
Hey there.
It's okay.

589
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,943
Nice mummy.

590
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,479
[groans softly]

591
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:08,655
It must be so weird
for him.

592
00:23:08,788 --> 00:23:10,857
He's kind of like
a time traveler.

593
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:13,826
[groans softly]

594
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,294
[gasps]

595
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:19,999
No, he's back!

596
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:21,434
We gotta get out
of here, now!

597
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:22,735
But what about
the mummy?

598
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:24,270
Forget about him,
he's not our problem.

599
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,538
Kubot is!
Come on.

600
00:23:25,672 --> 00:23:26,839
I'm sorry.

601
00:23:26,973 --> 00:23:28,875
[sad groaning]

602
00:23:40,487 --> 00:23:42,021
Woah.
What happened?

603
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:46,526
Looks like
you've been hit.

604
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:53,399
No.

605
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:55,702
No, no!

606
00:23:56,569 --> 00:23:58,638
[breathing heavily]

607
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:01,474
-That was close.
-Too close.

608
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:07,780
-The mummy.
-It's gone.

609
00:24:07,914 --> 00:24:09,916
So that's what
they were after.

610
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:13,219
Oh, whoever did this
is going to pay.

611
00:24:16,523 --> 00:24:17,857
If my dad would let me
get a phone

612
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,258
I could've
gotten pictures.

613
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:20,493
Getting pictures would be
the last thing on my mind.

614
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:21,894
We're talking life
after death.

615
00:24:22,028 --> 00:24:23,663
This could've been the story
of the century.

616
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,031
I say we go back
to our homes

617
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:27,066
and forget we ever saw
what we saw.

618
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:28,568
-[groaning]
-[gasps]

619
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:30,937
Shoo! Go away!

620
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,505
Go away! Go!
Go, go!

621
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:34,874
Turn around.
Go around.

622
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:36,042
Go away.

623
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:37,544
No, no, no, no.

624
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:40,446
Stay. Stay.

625
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,115
[sad groaning]

626
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:44,717
We can't let him go
back to Kubot's.

627
00:24:44,851 --> 00:24:46,485
Well then what are we supposed
to do with this thing?

628
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:48,220
Well, someone needs to put
him up for the night.

629
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:50,890
Why are both of you
looking at me?

630
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:52,224
Your house is right here.

631
00:24:52,358 --> 00:24:53,560
And Gilbert's
is right there!

632
00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:54,727
But yours is closer.

633
00:24:54,861 --> 00:24:56,128
Besides, I can't even
take care of a goldfish,

634
00:24:56,262 --> 00:24:57,363
much less a mummy.

635
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,131
You want me to take
a live dead mummy

636
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:00,700
into my house
with my mom home?

637
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,001
You're the one
who loves monsters.

638
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:03,235
Not real ones!

639
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:04,503
You just need to put
him up for the night.

640
00:25:04,637 --> 00:25:06,072
I've got to get home.
School night. See ya!

641
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:07,106
Yeah me too. Later.

642
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,675
Wait! Wait! Wait!

643
00:25:08,808 --> 00:25:11,744
You can't just leave me here
with this... thing.

644
00:25:11,878 --> 00:25:14,313
[sad groaning]

645
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:24,423
Shhh.

646
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:35,367
Marshall?

647
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:36,703
Hey Marshall.

648
00:25:36,836 --> 00:25:38,070
Mom: You're out late
for a school night.

649
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:41,574
Marshall: Uh... Lost track
of time, sorry.

650
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:43,109
[groaning]

651
00:25:43,242 --> 00:25:44,644
[coughing]

652
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:46,012
Well, come join us.

653
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:47,580
This is one of
Ted's favorite movies.

654
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:48,881
It's mummy-rific.

655
00:25:49,015 --> 00:25:50,116
No thanks.

656
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:52,151
I've had my fill of mummies
for one day.

657
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:54,020
Have you had anything to eat?
We have pizza.

658
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:56,088
Thanks, but I'll come
and get some in a minute.

659
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:57,223
Okay.

660
00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:03,329
[laughing]

661
00:26:03,462 --> 00:26:04,396
So good.

662
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:10,202
[grumbling]

663
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:15,307
Ahhh!

664
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:17,610
No! Jeez.
It's not real.

665
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:21,013
See? Fake.
This is Warthead.

666
00:26:21,147 --> 00:26:22,915
Greatest monster
of all time.

667
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:24,951
Well, greatest fictional
monster anyway.

668
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:26,385
[groaning]

669
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:27,820
No, my comics!

670
00:26:27,954 --> 00:26:29,388
[groaning curiously]

671
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:31,691
*

672
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:33,159
No, don't break that.

673
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:35,762
*

674
00:26:35,895 --> 00:26:37,897
No, you can't eat that.

675
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,932
*

676
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:45,872
Maybe you guys
are related.

677
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,842
[grumbling]

678
00:26:51,644 --> 00:26:53,079
Uh... No!

679
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:55,381
Okay, that's enough
wrecking my room for tonight.

680
00:26:55,514 --> 00:26:57,049
[roars]

681
00:26:57,183 --> 00:26:58,818
Mom: Marshall?

682
00:27:00,086 --> 00:27:01,620
Thought I'd save you
a trip.

683
00:27:01,754 --> 00:27:03,823
We ordered extra pepperoni
and hot sauce.

684
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:05,057
Just the way you like it.

685
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:06,225
[nervously]
Thank you.

686
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:07,459
You're so considerate.

687
00:27:07,593 --> 00:27:09,161
In fact you're the most
considerate of all moms

688
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:11,563
that I know anywhere...ever.

689
00:27:11,698 --> 00:27:12,865
Mm-hmm.

690
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:14,233
Why are you being
so nice?

691
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:16,235
Did you break the washing
machine again?

692
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:18,004
Mom, that was once,
when I was five.

693
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:20,506
All right.

694
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:21,974
Well anyways, I have
a lot of homework,

695
00:27:22,108 --> 00:27:23,710
so I'd better be getting
to that.

696
00:27:23,843 --> 00:27:25,044
Thank you.

697
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:28,114
[sniffing]

698
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:29,682
What is that smell?

699
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:31,650
Oh, it's probably
just my gym socks.

700
00:27:31,784 --> 00:27:33,152
I haven't changed them
in a while.

701
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:35,121
Well, wash them. Please.

702
00:27:35,254 --> 00:27:37,123
It smells like they haven't
been washed in 1,000 years.

703
00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:38,257
Ulgh!

704
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,728
[sighs]

705
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:43,763
[grumbling]

706
00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:45,965
Ulgh! She's right.

707
00:27:46,098 --> 00:27:48,134
You are a little whiffy.

708
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:49,435
[grumbles]

709
00:27:49,568 --> 00:27:50,602
Hope you like Ocean Breeze.

[grumbles]

713
00:27:57,043 --> 00:28:01,247
Here. It's pizza.
You eat it.

714
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:04,383

[sniffs]

716
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,923
[grumbles]
Mmm.

717
00:28:11,057 --> 00:28:12,825
Bet you didn't have that
in ancient Egypt.

718
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:14,393
Oh wait, wait!

719
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,928
I almost forgot
the best part.

720
00:28:16,662 --> 00:28:18,064
Hot sauce.

721
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:26,873
[gasps]

722
00:28:27,006 --> 00:28:27,974
Too hot?

723
00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:29,608
[gasps]

724
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:33,645
Holy cow!

725
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,948
If you weren't already dead,
that would kill you!

726
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,385
[loud belching]

727
00:28:39,518 --> 00:28:40,719
Ew!

728
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:43,923
Wow.

729
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,524
The only other guy
that I knew

730
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:46,893
that liked hot sauce
as much as you

731
00:28:47,026 --> 00:28:48,294
was my grandpa.

732
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:49,328
[grumbles]
Hmm?

733
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:50,596
Harold.

734
00:28:50,997 --> 00:28:53,099
Maybe I could
call you Harold.

735
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:54,901
I mean, I have to call
you something.

736
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:56,936
[grumbles]
Huh?

737
00:28:57,636 --> 00:28:59,338
How about it...Harold?

738
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:00,539
[grumbles]
Hmm.

739
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:01,740
Okay.

740
00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:04,710
Marshall. Me Marshall.

741
00:29:04,844 --> 00:29:06,913
Harold. You Harold.

742
00:29:07,947 --> 00:29:10,049
Me Marshall.

743
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:12,484
You Harold.

744
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:14,653
[grumbles]

745
00:29:14,787 --> 00:29:16,522
[grumbles words]
Mar mur...

746
00:29:16,655 --> 00:29:18,057
Mm-hmm.

747
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,458
[grumbles words]

748
00:29:23,662 --> 00:29:25,297
Close enough.

749
00:29:28,234 --> 00:29:30,769
This should be more comfortable
than that old coffin.

750
00:29:30,903 --> 00:29:33,472
[grumbling]

751
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,541
Hey. Time to go to sleep.

752
00:29:35,674 --> 00:29:36,675
[grumbles]
Hmm.

753
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:38,677
You know, sleep.

754
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:40,847
[grumbling]

755
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,748
Good night, Harold.

756
00:29:52,358 --> 00:29:54,793
[snoring loudly]

757
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,676
*  The future's on the line  *

758
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,144
*  So let's go back in time  *

759
00:30:12,278 --> 00:30:15,181
*  We could fix the past
and make it right  *

760
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:18,084
Teri, turn off music.

761
00:30:18,217 --> 00:30:19,418
Okay. Turning off music.

762
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:20,953
Marshall!

763
00:30:21,087 --> 00:30:22,588
We have to get to the pharmacy
early today.

764
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:24,156
Please don't be late
for school.

765
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:25,291
Marshall: I won't, Mom.

766
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:26,893
Have a good day.

767
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:30,162
[grumbling]

768
00:30:30,296 --> 00:30:31,730
Okay, Harold.

769
00:30:31,864 --> 00:30:34,066
I have to go to school.

770
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,502
You can't come.

771
00:30:36,635 --> 00:30:38,170
Got it?

772
00:30:38,938 --> 00:30:41,007
And please try not
to break anything.

773
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:43,442
[grumbling]

774
00:30:45,377 --> 00:30:50,016
No, you have to stay
in my room.

775
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:52,451
Don't worry. I'll be
right back after school.

776
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:54,921
[grumbling]

777
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:58,624
Marshall, you survived.

778
00:30:58,757 --> 00:31:00,292
Yeah.

779
00:31:00,426 --> 00:31:02,428
I was worried maybe
the mummy ate your
brains like Todd said.

780
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:04,063
Nah. He's actually
pretty cool

781
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,431
once you get used
to him.

782
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:07,233
Oh, and I named him
Harold.

783
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:08,500
Harold?

784
00:31:08,634 --> 00:31:10,602
Harold, hmm?
I like it.

785
00:31:10,736 --> 00:31:11,938
But realistically,

786
00:31:12,071 --> 00:31:13,605
I can't keep him
in my house forever.

787
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:15,341
Sooner or later my mom
will find him.

788
00:31:15,474 --> 00:31:17,409
Well, we should return him
to the museum.

789
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:18,677
Museums are for
dead mummies,

790
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:19,946
not live ones.

791
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,780
Oh hey, you didn't happen
to find my inhaler

792
00:31:21,914 --> 00:31:23,182
at your house,
did you?

793
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:24,316
No. Why?

794
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:25,851
I lost it, and if
my mom finds out,

795
00:31:25,985 --> 00:31:27,319
she'll kill me.

796
00:31:28,187 --> 00:31:29,956
[grumbling]

797
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:33,993
[grumbling]

798
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:44,903
[screams]

799
00:31:51,978 --> 00:31:54,981
[roars loudly]

800
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:09,528
[sad grumbling]

801
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:16,302
[grumbling]

802
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,441
[laughing]

803
00:32:27,346 --> 00:32:28,814
[roars]

804
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,450
And to complete our section
on ancient Egypt

805
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:35,321
you are all going to team up
for a creative project.

806
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:37,156
[class groans]

807
00:32:37,856 --> 00:32:40,126
It can be anything
you dream up.

808
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:42,828
From writing a story
in hieroglyphics,

809
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,697
to creating an outfit
for a pharaoh,

810
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:48,100
to sculpting a sphinx.

811
00:32:48,234 --> 00:32:50,602
Can I just bring in my parents'
Egyptian cotton sheets?

812
00:32:50,736 --> 00:32:53,105
Looking for a little more
imagination than that, Todd.

813
00:32:53,239 --> 00:32:54,506
How about making a movie?

814
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,742
Now that's imaginative.

815
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:58,210
Then Gilbert,
Amy and I

816
00:32:58,344 --> 00:33:00,146
are going to make
a movie together.

817
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:01,847
-We are?
-Sounds good to me.

818
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,849
So to review our
Egyptian mythology...

819
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,051
Guys...

820
00:33:05,184 --> 00:33:06,718
We're going
to make a mummy movie

821
00:33:06,852 --> 00:33:08,720
with a real mummy.

822
00:33:09,755 --> 00:33:10,856
Hmm.

823
00:33:12,058 --> 00:33:13,559
[grumbling]

824
00:33:16,895 --> 00:33:18,497
[frightened grumble]

825
00:33:24,203 --> 00:33:26,505
[grumbling]

826
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:42,854
[grumbling]
Yum-yum.

827
00:33:48,127 --> 00:33:49,128
[slurping]

828
00:33:49,261 --> 00:33:50,462
[startled gasps]

829
00:33:50,596 --> 00:33:52,398
TV: Congratulations
to the big winners.

830
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,433
And now the weather
with Terry Taylor.

831
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:55,534
Terry?

832
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:57,369
Yes. How can Teri help you?

833
00:33:57,503 --> 00:33:58,770
[roars]

834
00:33:58,904 --> 00:34:00,772
Teri: I didn't catch that.
Please try again.

835
00:34:00,906 --> 00:34:02,608
Highs today are
below average...

836
00:34:02,741 --> 00:34:04,009
[roars]

837
00:34:04,143 --> 00:34:05,944
Teri: You want to order
13 bags of birdseed.

838
00:34:06,078 --> 00:34:07,079
Is that correct?

839
00:34:07,213 --> 00:34:08,447
[roars]

840
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,517
Oh, you want to order
14 bags of birdseed.

841
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,152
I can do that.

842
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:14,453
[grumbles]

843
00:34:18,457 --> 00:34:21,293
[frustrated grumbling]

844
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:26,598
[frustrated grumbling]

845
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,934
[frustrated grumbling]

846
00:34:35,341 --> 00:34:36,708
[whimpers]

847
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:43,782
[scared grumbling]

848
00:34:50,356 --> 00:34:51,790
[roars]

849
00:34:57,263 --> 00:34:58,964
[scared grumbling]

850
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:15,147
Miss Pratt: Your final exam
will be this Friday.

851
00:35:15,281 --> 00:35:17,216
Okay little monsters.

852
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:19,385
Have an awesome weekend
and a great Halloween

853
00:35:19,518 --> 00:35:21,487
and I'll probably see
a bunch of you

854
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,054
at the Halloween carnival.

855
00:35:23,189 --> 00:35:25,624
But unless you want to be really
frightened, don't forget...

856
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:30,196
your assignments
are due on Wednesday.

857
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:31,763
[cackles]

858
00:35:31,897 --> 00:35:33,365
-[bell rings]
-Finally!

859
00:35:34,433 --> 00:35:37,269
So get, get those into me...
please.

860
00:35:37,936 --> 00:35:38,737
No, Marsh.

861
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:39,971
Enough horror movies.

862
00:35:40,105 --> 00:35:42,073
Okay. The newest Warthead
is just way better.

863
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,842
I'm not trying to get
scared again.

864
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:44,843
Wait...

865
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,178
Oh no!

866
00:35:48,314 --> 00:35:49,348
[gasps]

867
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:53,585
-Harold!
-Harold!

868
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:55,153
Harold!

869
00:35:56,522 --> 00:35:57,623
Woman: Yes, exactly.

870
00:35:57,756 --> 00:36:00,025
Of course it's important.
That's why I'm yelling.

871
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,760
[grumbles]

872
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:03,262
Nice costume, weirdo.

873
00:36:05,797 --> 00:36:06,898
Heads up.

874
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:07,766
[bike bell]

875
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:08,934
[grumbles]

876
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:12,137
Sample, get your sample?

877
00:36:15,274 --> 00:36:16,575
Free sample?

878
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:17,843
They're delicious.

879
00:36:17,976 --> 00:36:19,278
[grumbling]

880
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:28,920
*

881
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:34,059
[grunts]

882
00:36:35,261 --> 00:36:36,662
[grumbles]

883
00:36:58,417 --> 00:36:59,685
Harold?

884
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:01,620
I can't find him.

885
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,489
He's not downstairs.

886
00:37:03,622 --> 00:37:04,623
He's not upstairs either.

887
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:06,157
-Then where can he be?
-I don't know.

888
00:37:06,292 --> 00:37:08,159
He must've gone out.
We have to find him.

889
00:37:08,294 --> 00:37:09,928
We'll get a map
and search the city.

890
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,430
We can search downtown.

891
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:12,731
We have to search
the whole city.

892
00:37:12,864 --> 00:37:14,032
Amy: I think my mom has
an extra map.

893
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:15,100
We can go stop at my house
on the way.

894
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,835
Uh, Marshall?

895
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:18,670
Why is the TV remote
stuck to the ceiling.

896
00:37:22,508 --> 00:37:23,542
Come on, let's go.

897
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:25,277
We need to split up
and look for him.

898
00:37:25,411 --> 00:37:26,545
He can't be far...

899
00:37:26,678 --> 00:37:27,713
Whoa!

900
00:37:27,846 --> 00:37:29,715
Hi. Hi Mr. Killbot,
I mean, Mr. Kubot.

901
00:37:29,848 --> 00:37:31,517
What are, what are
you doing here?

902
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,619
Something happened
last night.

903
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:35,987
There was a break-in
in my house.

904
00:37:36,121 --> 00:37:39,090
You didn't happen to see
anybody or notice anything?

905
00:37:39,224 --> 00:37:42,027
Anything out of
the ordinary?

906
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,196
No. Everything was very
in the ordinary.

907
00:37:45,331 --> 00:37:46,765
Yeah, we didn't see
a thing.

908
00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:48,266
Or hear a thing.

909
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,735
No strange sights
or sounds.

910
00:37:49,868 --> 00:37:51,437
Nothing. All right. Well,
we'd better be going now.

911
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:53,439
Sorry we couldn't be
more helpful.

912
00:37:53,572 --> 00:37:54,773
-Bye!
-Have a nice day!

913
00:37:54,906 --> 00:37:56,408

914
00:37:59,345 --> 00:38:00,312
[grumbling]

915
00:38:07,753 --> 00:38:09,488
[grumbling]

916
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,726
Harold, come on!

917
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,927
Where could he be?

918
00:38:16,061 --> 00:38:17,329
Come on, Harold.

919
00:38:19,365 --> 00:38:22,434
[groaning]

920
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:33,144
[grunts]
Ah!!!

921
00:38:41,687 --> 00:38:42,888
Harold, please!

922
00:38:43,021 --> 00:38:44,122
It's no use. He could
be anywhere.

923
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:45,491
Well let's think about
this logically.

924
00:38:45,624 --> 00:38:46,925
If you were
a 4,000-year-old mummy,

925
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:47,926
where would you go?

926
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:49,528
I don't know, to get
fresh bandages?

927
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:50,796
Harold!

928
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:52,431
-Harold!
-Harold! Come on!

929
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,666
No.

930
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,267
You don't think...

931
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,770
It's as good a place
as any.

932
00:38:58,904 --> 00:38:59,971
Come on! Let's go.

933
00:39:06,478 --> 00:39:09,247
[sad grumbling]

934
00:39:10,649 --> 00:39:11,917
Harold!

935
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,586
[whimpering]

936
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,054
I told you to stay
at the house.

937
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,689
[grumbling]

938
00:39:17,823 --> 00:39:19,558
What's he saying?

939
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:20,659
I don't speak mummy.

940
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:22,093
[grumbling angrily]

941
00:39:24,062 --> 00:39:25,764
Look. They have
the same amulet.

942
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:27,433
Amy: Remember what
the tour guide told us?

943
00:39:27,566 --> 00:39:29,234
If Harold and the princess
were in love,

944
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,769
maybe the amulet
is like

945
00:39:30,902 --> 00:39:32,504
some ancient Egyptian
engagement ring

946
00:39:32,638 --> 00:39:34,205
and he wants to be
back together with her.

947
00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:35,774
Yeah, yeah.
Maybe you're right.

948
00:39:35,907 --> 00:39:37,409
Yeah.

949
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:38,844
[sad grumbling]

950
00:39:40,746 --> 00:39:42,548
Come on, Harold.
We have to go.

951
00:39:42,681 --> 00:39:44,550
It's not safe
for you here.

952
00:39:44,683 --> 00:39:46,084
[sad grumbles]

953
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,453
I get it.

954
00:39:47,586 --> 00:39:50,055
You want to be with her.
But not right now.

955
00:39:50,188 --> 00:39:51,423
Harold, he's right.

956
00:39:51,557 --> 00:39:52,858
If anyone figures out
what you are,

957
00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:54,926
they'll send you to a lab
to do experiments on,

958
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,294
or put you in
a freak show.

959
00:39:56,428 --> 00:39:57,829
Please Harold.
Come on.

960
00:39:57,963 --> 00:39:59,998
[sad grumbling]

961
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:03,301
Hey. No touching
the exhibits.

962
00:40:03,435 --> 00:40:04,436
Sorry sir.
We're just leaving.

963
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:05,771
Yeah.

964
00:40:08,874 --> 00:40:10,175
What's with the costume?

965
00:40:10,308 --> 00:40:11,843
Uh, he's a huge
Egyptology fan.

966
00:40:11,977 --> 00:40:13,111
Halloween fanatic.

967
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,412
Big into cosplay.

968
00:40:15,547 --> 00:40:16,915
Cosplay?

969
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:20,085
No Harold, no.
Come on.

970
00:40:20,218 --> 00:40:21,487
I'm telling you guys.

971
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,354
Harold's going to come back
here the first chance he gets.

972
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:25,256
We can't keep him
away forever.

973
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,792
We need some
expert advice.

974
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,226
Who? We don't know
any Egyptologists.

975
00:40:29,227 --> 00:40:30,796
But we do know
a monsterologist.

976
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,631
Buzzy! Come on!

977
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:33,865
That's true.

978
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:35,000
Who's Buzzy?

979
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:36,334
No Harold, come on.

980
00:40:36,468 --> 00:40:37,503
Let's go.

981
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,304
Faster!

982
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,706
[grumbles]

983
00:40:41,607 --> 00:40:43,208
Buzzy: A living mummy?

984
00:40:43,341 --> 00:40:44,442
Give me a break.

985
00:40:44,576 --> 00:40:47,078
No, he really is
a 4,000-year-old mummy.

986
00:40:47,212 --> 00:40:48,547
Honest.

987
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,281
Okay. Then if he's really
a dead living mummy,

988
00:40:50,415 --> 00:40:52,417
he wouldn't have a pulse now,
would he?

989
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:57,088
[grumbles]

990
00:40:57,222 --> 00:40:58,757
Holy guacamole.

991
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,059
He's dead.

992
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:03,695
[hysterically]
He's... dead!

993
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:05,531
He's dead! He's dead!

994
00:41:05,664 --> 00:41:07,899
He, he, he's dead!
He's dead, he's dead!

995
00:41:08,033 --> 00:41:10,702
He... he... he...
He's dead!

996
00:41:10,836 --> 00:41:13,171
[giggles]

997
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,372
He's dead.

998
00:41:14,506 --> 00:41:15,607
Yeah, that was our point.

999
00:41:15,741 --> 00:41:17,008
Do you realize

1000
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:20,512
this is the most amazing
discovery since penicillin?

1001
00:41:20,646 --> 00:41:22,548
Or the lost city
of Atlantis?

1002
00:41:22,681 --> 00:41:23,682
Actually, Atlantis
is still lost.

1003
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:26,417
We're talking reanimating
the dead.

1004
00:41:26,552 --> 00:41:28,520
You should call the Smithsonian
or a scientific journal,

1005
00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:29,988
or one of those
tabloid magazines

1006
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:31,289
they sell in
the checkout line.

1007
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:32,490
Marshall: Oh no!

1008
00:41:32,624 --> 00:41:33,959
We have to keep
him a secret.

1009
00:41:34,092 --> 00:41:35,393
Buzzy: Wait a minute.

1010
00:41:35,527 --> 00:41:37,929
Wasn't there a mummy stolen
on its way to the museum?

1011
00:41:38,063 --> 00:41:39,330
We didn't steal it.

1012
00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:41,166
Yeah.
We're trying to stop
the people who did

1013
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:43,001
from getting their hands
on Harold.

1014
00:41:43,134 --> 00:41:44,335
[grumbling]

1015
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:46,171
Buzzy: Harold?
You're calling him Harold?

1016
00:41:46,304 --> 00:41:47,573
Can't just say,
"hey, mummy."

1017
00:41:47,706 --> 00:41:49,007
Anyways, we were hoping

1018
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,909
you might be able
to help us figure out

1019
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:52,443
how he came back to life
and what we do with him.

1020
00:41:52,578 --> 00:41:54,713
I wonder if it has anything
to do with that amulet.

1021
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:56,314
It could be the key
to the puzzle.

1022
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:57,482
Huh.

1023
00:41:57,616 --> 00:41:58,617
Good thinking.

1024
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:00,051
*

1025
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:01,386
*  Shake your hips.
Now take a chance  *

1026
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,154
*  Take a dive
into the unknown  *

1027
00:42:03,288 --> 00:42:05,691
*  'Cause we're gonna
bop dem bones  *

1028
00:42:05,824 --> 00:42:07,626
Are you seeing
what I'm seeing?

1029
00:42:07,759 --> 00:42:08,627
*  Bump 'em,
thump 'em  *

1030
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,128
* Get a jumping *

1031
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:11,462
He has potential.

1032
00:42:11,597 --> 00:42:12,764
*

1033
00:42:12,898 --> 00:42:14,199
Harold.

1034
00:42:14,332 --> 00:42:15,601
[grumbles]
Huh?

1035
00:42:15,734 --> 00:42:16,802
Come here.

1036
00:42:17,435 --> 00:42:18,436
Hi, uh...

1037
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:20,706
Mind if I get a look
at your amulet?

1038
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:22,407
-[roars angrily]
-[screams]

1039
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,711
No, Harold.
Friend. Friend.

1040
00:42:25,844 --> 00:42:26,978
[growls softly]

1041
00:42:27,112 --> 00:42:28,847
Yeah. I guess he's
a little bit protective

1042
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,516
-about his amulet.
-Yeah. You think?

1043
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:33,218
[exhales]

1044
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:39,257
Oh, there's an inscription.

1045
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,592
All: An inscription?

1046
00:42:40,726 --> 00:42:42,427
Can you help us out
with it?

1047
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,230
Yeah. But it's going
to take me a minute or two,

1048
00:42:45,363 --> 00:42:47,799
or 100, to figure it out.

1049
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,969
Let me take a photo.

1050
00:42:51,102 --> 00:42:53,772
Don't worry, Harold.
Buzzy's just trying to help you.

1051
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,340
It's okay.

1052
00:42:55,473 --> 00:42:56,908
[grumbles]

1053
00:42:57,776 --> 00:42:59,010
Yeah.

1054
00:42:59,144 --> 00:43:00,511
[roars loudly]

1055
00:43:00,646 --> 00:43:02,013
No, no, no, Harold.
It's okay.

1056
00:43:02,147 --> 00:43:03,048
She just took a photo.

1057
00:43:03,181 --> 00:43:04,282
[grumbles]

1058
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,216
Sorry!

1059
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:08,286
I'll see if I can get
the inscription deciphered.

1060
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,221
I'll get back to you guys
as soon as possible.

1061
00:43:10,355 --> 00:43:11,589
Thanks. Let's go.

1062
00:43:11,723 --> 00:43:13,058
We got a mummy movie
to make.

1063
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:22,600
[engine rumbling]

1064
00:43:32,678 --> 00:43:34,445
Ms. Ravensworth?

1065
00:43:34,579 --> 00:43:35,546
You wanted to see me?

1066
00:43:35,681 --> 00:43:37,348
How does one misplace
a mummy?

1067
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:39,818
Did it get up
and walk off?

1068
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:41,619
It's only temporary.

1069
00:43:41,753 --> 00:43:43,254
I just need a little
more time.

1070
00:43:43,388 --> 00:43:44,690
You have 48 hours

1071
00:43:44,823 --> 00:43:47,458
to produce one 12th Dynasty
Egyptian mummy with coffin

1072
00:43:47,592 --> 00:43:50,428
or I will expect a full
reimbursement on my advance,

1073
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:54,733
plus a hefty and painful
penalty.

1074
00:43:56,067 --> 00:43:57,502

1076
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:15,954
[sniffs]

1077
00:44:27,966 --> 00:44:29,334
Marshall: Guys!

1078
00:44:30,568 --> 00:44:32,771
Here it is.
Fresh off the printer.

1079
00:44:32,904 --> 00:44:34,806
The screenplay for...

1080
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,641
The Mummy's Awesome Revenge.

1081
00:44:36,775 --> 00:44:40,045
Gil, you're playing
Professor Glunditchberg,

1082
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:42,413
the brave and bold
Egyptologist.

1083
00:44:42,547 --> 00:44:44,783
Couldn't I get a character
with a more pronounceable name?

1084
00:44:46,284 --> 00:44:49,120
Amy, you're Doctor
Ilsa Von Keebler,

1085
00:44:49,254 --> 00:44:52,791
international archaeologist
and social media influencer.

1086
00:44:53,759 --> 00:44:55,026
Is that even a thing?

1087
00:44:57,295 --> 00:44:58,830
As for you, Harold.

1088
00:44:58,964 --> 00:45:00,165
[roars]

1089
00:45:00,298 --> 00:45:01,299
You're playing "the mummy"!

1090
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:02,667
[laughs]

1091
00:45:02,801 --> 00:45:03,735
Hey kids.

1092
00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:04,870
How's it going?

1093
00:45:05,003 --> 00:45:06,504
-Great.
-Really good.

1094
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:07,806
Who's your friend?

1095
00:45:07,939 --> 00:45:09,307
Um, him?

1096
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,177
Um... That's Harold.
A kid from school.

1097
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:13,912
He's playing
the killer mummy.

1098
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:15,280
He's a sixth grader?

1099
00:45:15,413 --> 00:45:18,917
He should actually be in ninth,
but he got held back.

1100
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:20,919
-[grumbles]
-Several times.

1101
00:45:22,487 --> 00:45:24,522
Well remember how you said
you couldn't find costumes

1102
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:25,590
for your movie?

1103
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:26,892
Guess who found them.

1104
00:45:27,025 --> 00:45:28,459
-Cool.
-Nice.

1105
00:45:28,593 --> 00:45:29,494
[laughs]

1106
00:45:29,627 --> 00:45:30,962
A few years back,
my agency did a spot

1107
00:45:31,096 --> 00:45:32,964
for Animal Crackers
with a jungle set.

1108
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:37,702
Luckily, we still had
the costumes in storage.

1109
00:45:42,373 --> 00:45:44,009
We really need to get
started filming.

1110
00:45:46,144 --> 00:45:47,378
Mom: Uh, okay.

1111
00:45:48,379 --> 00:45:50,681
Well good luck
with your blockbuster.

1112
00:45:50,816 --> 00:45:52,117
-Gilbert: Thank you.
-Amy: Thanks. See ya.

1113
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,484
[grumbles]

1114
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:54,986
[sighs]

1115
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,321
That guy is so annoying.

1116
00:45:56,454 --> 00:45:58,223
Yeah. So annoying.

1117
00:45:58,356 --> 00:46:00,591
He brought costumes
for our movie.

1118
00:46:00,725 --> 00:46:03,394
So what's your problem
with him exactly?

1119
00:46:03,528 --> 00:46:05,030
He's just so...

1120
00:46:05,163 --> 00:46:07,332
So... so Ted.

1121
00:46:07,465 --> 00:46:10,201
Is it that he's so Ted,

1122
00:46:10,335 --> 00:46:13,204
or is it that you don't want
anyone to be with your mom?

1123
00:46:13,338 --> 00:46:15,173
No. No.

1124
00:46:17,342 --> 00:46:19,444
You know, when
my dad remarried

1125
00:46:19,577 --> 00:46:22,213
I wouldn't talk to my new
stepdad for almost six months.

1126
00:46:22,347 --> 00:46:23,815
Total silent treatment.

1127
00:46:23,949 --> 00:46:26,351
Then one day I realized
something.

1128
00:46:26,484 --> 00:46:29,821
He makes him happy
and he makes him laugh.

1129
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,423
Maybe I was wrong
about him.

1130
00:46:32,557 --> 00:46:34,525
He and I are super
close now.

1131
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:37,128
So maybe you should give
this Ted guy a chance.

1132
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:44,202
But um, whatever.

1133
00:46:44,335 --> 00:46:46,071
It's none of my business.

1134
00:46:46,204 --> 00:46:47,738
Sorry for butting in.

1135
00:46:47,873 --> 00:46:49,740
Let's get back to work.

1136
00:46:53,044 --> 00:46:54,779
She's kind of got a point,
Marsh.

1137
00:46:54,913 --> 00:46:57,082
Uh-huh. We should
get back to work.

1138
00:46:57,782 --> 00:46:59,050
We've got a movie
to make.

1139
00:46:59,184 --> 00:46:59,918
Come on, Harold.

1140
00:47:00,051 --> 00:47:01,152
[grumbles]
Hmm?

1141
00:47:01,286 --> 00:47:02,787
Marshall:
Mummy's Awesome Revenge.

1142
00:47:02,921 --> 00:47:04,189
Scene one, take one.

1143
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:05,556
[wind howling]

1144
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:07,825
At last!

1145
00:47:07,959 --> 00:47:10,128
We found it,
Doctor Von Keebler!

1146
00:47:11,296 --> 00:47:12,297
There it is.

1147
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:14,432
The lost pyramid of
Yo-Hotep.

1148
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:15,700
Let's go.

1149
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,268
Amy: Adventure awaits.

1150
00:47:17,402 --> 00:47:18,603
Gilbert: Yeah.

1151
00:47:21,372 --> 00:47:24,609
Okay. All we have to
do is navigate this
dark spooky corridor,

1152
00:47:24,742 --> 00:47:28,113
solve ancient riddles,

1153
00:47:28,246 --> 00:47:31,716
and make it across the pit of
a thousand disgusting horrors.

1154
00:47:32,918 --> 00:47:35,220
It's going to be a day,
so if you want to turn back,

1155
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:38,556
as a scientist, I could not
scientifically blame you.

1156
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,358
No, Doctor Von Keebler!

1157
00:47:40,491 --> 00:47:41,826
We've come too far
to give up.

1158
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,062
Totally, but you know.

1159
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:47,432
It's just a lot of dangerous,
uh, danger.

1160
00:47:47,565 --> 00:47:48,766
Danger?

1161
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,069
Professor Glunditchberg
never runs from danger.

1162
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:53,771
We must face our fears.

1163
00:47:55,473 --> 00:47:56,975
A-ha!

1164
00:47:57,542 --> 00:47:58,809
We did it.

1165
00:48:00,478 --> 00:48:03,548
Now, if my calculations
are correct,

1166
00:48:03,681 --> 00:48:07,385
we'll find the legendary silver
serpent inside this coffin.

1167
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:10,288
[gasps]

1168
00:48:10,421 --> 00:48:11,422
[roars]

1169
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:13,124
Oh no, it's a live mummy.

1170
00:48:13,258 --> 00:48:15,293
And it wants to eat
our brains!

1171
00:48:15,426 --> 00:48:16,327
[grumbles]

1172
00:48:16,461 --> 00:48:17,963
-Cut.
-Huh?

1173
00:48:18,096 --> 00:48:20,265
Harold, you're supposed
to be fierce.

1174
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:21,166
[grumbles]

1175
00:48:21,299 --> 00:48:22,934
I'm not really
seeing fierce.

1176
00:48:23,068 --> 00:48:24,569
[grumbles]

1177
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:26,471
Take two.

1178
00:48:26,604 --> 00:48:28,073
*

1179
00:48:28,206 --> 00:48:30,408
Oh no. It's a live mummy.

1180
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:32,643
And it wants to eat
our brains!

1181
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:35,413
Reset.

1182
00:48:35,546 --> 00:48:37,182
*

1183
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:39,850
Marshall: Cut.

1184
00:48:42,353 --> 00:48:43,354
Marshall: Cut.

1185
00:48:43,488 --> 00:48:44,389
[burps]

1186
00:48:44,522 --> 00:48:45,256
Marshall: Cut.

1187
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:46,324
[snoring]

1188
00:48:46,457 --> 00:48:47,358
Marshall: Cut.

1189
00:48:47,825 --> 00:48:49,760
[loud roar]

1190
00:48:49,894 --> 00:48:51,096
Cut!

1191
00:48:51,229 --> 00:48:52,497
Nailed it!

1192
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:54,032
[grumbles happily]

1193
00:48:54,532 --> 00:48:55,600
Marshall?

1194
00:48:55,733 --> 00:48:56,934
It's your friend Buzzy.

1195
00:48:57,068 --> 00:48:58,303
She says it's important.

1196
00:48:59,704 --> 00:49:01,239
[confused grumbling]

1197
00:49:03,474 --> 00:49:05,910
So this is a database
of the hieroglyphics

1198
00:49:06,044 --> 00:49:07,512
known to mainstream
Egyptologists.

1199
00:49:07,645 --> 00:49:09,780
And they were no help.

1200
00:49:09,914 --> 00:49:11,216
But you've got
to understand.

1201
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:13,184
Hieroglyphics aren't
like the alphabet.

1202
00:49:13,318 --> 00:49:14,986
There aren't 26.

1203
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,087
There are like a gazillion.

1204
00:49:16,221 --> 00:49:18,156
So then I did
some digging around.

1205
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:20,525
I have my secret sources.

1206
00:49:20,658 --> 00:49:21,892
Marshall: Wikipedia, huh?

1207
00:49:22,027 --> 00:49:24,729
No. I actually had to dig
through old-timey books.

1208
00:49:24,862 --> 00:49:26,164
Very 20th century.

1209
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:28,266
Anyway, here's what I found

1210
00:49:28,399 --> 00:49:30,235
when I decoded
the hieroglyphics.

1211
00:49:30,368 --> 00:49:33,338
The amulet is like
a three-day pass

1212
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:35,240
back into the world
of the living.

1213
00:49:35,373 --> 00:49:38,109
It's activated by exposure
to moonlight.

1214
00:49:38,243 --> 00:49:39,910
That explains why Harold
came back to life.

1215
00:49:40,045 --> 00:49:41,879
Gilbert exposed the amulet
to moonlight

1216
00:49:42,013 --> 00:49:43,748
in Kubot's basement.

1217
00:49:43,881 --> 00:49:44,882
You're right.

1218
00:49:45,016 --> 00:49:46,384
Yay me.

1219
00:49:46,517 --> 00:49:48,686
I went ahead and translated
the symbols.

1220
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,555
Here's what they say.

1221
00:49:50,688 --> 00:49:52,257
[exhales]

1222
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:55,760
[imitates ghost]
This amulet will
raise the dead.

1223
00:49:55,893 --> 00:49:57,062
[evil laughter]
Muahaha.

1224
00:49:57,195 --> 00:49:58,429
Can you just read it
in a regular voice?

1225
00:49:58,563 --> 00:49:59,797
Oh, sorry.

1226
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:01,599
I thought it would give it
a little more gravitas.

1227
00:50:02,533 --> 00:50:03,368
Nah.

1228
00:50:04,535 --> 00:50:07,072
Ah. "This amulet
will raise the dead.

1229
00:50:07,205 --> 00:50:09,674
"For three days
they will live instead.

1230
00:50:09,807 --> 00:50:11,442
"But in their coffin
they must be

1231
00:50:11,576 --> 00:50:13,611
"by midnight
on the day of three,

1232
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:15,346
"or doomed forever
they will be

1233
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,215
"throughout all
of absurdity.

1234
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:19,150
"Throughout all
of absurdity"?

1235
00:50:19,284 --> 00:50:20,685
Eternity, not absurdity.

1236
00:50:20,818 --> 00:50:23,721
Doomed throughout
all of eternity.

1237
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,190
Yes, that sounds
so much better.

1238
00:50:25,323 --> 00:50:27,024
No, it sounds horrible.

1239
00:50:27,158 --> 00:50:28,793
I guess on the bad news scale
from one to ten,

1240
00:50:28,926 --> 00:50:30,795
that's an 11,
maybe 11 and a half.

1241
00:50:30,928 --> 00:50:33,198
What does "doomed throughout
all eternity" mean?

1242
00:50:33,331 --> 00:50:35,233
Well, if he doesn't
make it back

1243
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:37,202
into his coffin
by day three,

1244
00:50:37,335 --> 00:50:39,137
he could turn to dust.

1245
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:45,376
Third full day would be...
tomorrow!

1246
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:47,578
That means that we need
to get Harold back

1247
00:50:47,712 --> 00:50:49,547
into his coffin by midnight
on Halloween.

1248
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,549
But Harold just got here.

1249
00:50:51,682 --> 00:50:53,451
He can't go.
He's our friend.

1250
00:50:53,584 --> 00:50:54,985
Friends have each
other's backs, right?

1251
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:57,122
So we have to do
what's right by Harold.

1252
00:50:57,255 --> 00:51:00,158
Even if it's not
what we want.

1253
00:51:02,193 --> 00:51:03,761
[sighs]

1254
00:51:04,028 --> 00:51:05,463
[grumbles]
Huh?

1255
00:51:07,632 --> 00:51:08,799
Yeah.

1256
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,802
We have to do
what's right by Harold.

1257
00:51:11,936 --> 00:51:13,671
We're going
to put him back.

1258
00:51:17,308 --> 00:51:18,809
Okay. So here's
the plan.

1259
00:51:18,943 --> 00:51:20,711
We slip in through the basement
just like before,

1260
00:51:20,845 --> 00:51:22,513
put Harold back
into his coffin

1261
00:51:22,647 --> 00:51:24,282
and get out without
Kubot ever knowing.

1262
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:26,284
Then we make an anonymous
call to the museum

1263
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:27,785
and tell them where they can
find the stolen mummy.

1264
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:29,720
Harold goes back
to the museum

1265
00:51:29,854 --> 00:51:30,988
and reunited
with his GF.

1266
00:51:31,122 --> 00:51:32,089
Win-win.

1267
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:33,258
Well, except for Kubot.

1268
00:51:33,391 --> 00:51:34,492
Okay, but let's make
this quick.

1269
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:36,394
We don't want to run
into Kubot again.

1270
00:51:36,527 --> 00:51:38,062
That guy is
seriously scary.

1271
00:51:38,196 --> 00:51:39,364
Marshall: Let's go.

1272
00:51:44,669 --> 00:51:46,003
Gilbert: Are you sure
he's not home?

1273
00:51:46,137 --> 00:51:47,572
Marshall: He's not home.
It's fine.

1274
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:50,575
Gilbert: So much for him
not being home.

1275
00:51:52,543 --> 00:51:53,644
Oh no.

1276
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:55,213
What are they doing
with Harold's coffin?

1277
00:51:55,346 --> 00:51:56,947
It looks like they're
moving it!

1278
00:51:57,081 --> 00:51:58,449
-Duck!
-Woah!

1279
00:52:02,353 --> 00:52:03,821
Okay. Let's go.

1280
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:06,591
[grunting]

1281
00:52:10,395 --> 00:52:11,329
Careful!

1282
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:12,597
Kubot: It's heavy.

1283
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:27,278
[grumbling]

1284
00:52:33,751 --> 00:52:34,852
[grumbling]

1285
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:39,557
Take it to the plant.
It'll be safer there.

1286
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:40,825
You got it.

1287
00:52:41,592 --> 00:52:43,261
-Plant?
-I don't know.

1288
00:52:45,263 --> 00:52:46,531
[truck engine starts]

1289
00:52:55,139 --> 00:52:56,641
[sad grumbling]

1290
00:52:57,575 --> 00:52:58,876
It's okay, Harold.

1291
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,778
We're going to get it
back for you.

1292
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:03,981
Somehow. Let's go.

1293
00:53:12,557 --> 00:53:13,758
Hmm?

1294
00:53:17,161 --> 00:53:18,396
Gilbert Anderson.

1295
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:20,064
[laughs]

1296
00:53:21,499 --> 00:53:23,668
*

1297
00:53:30,007 --> 00:53:31,576
Got snacks!

1298
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:36,947
[grumbles]

1299
00:53:37,081 --> 00:53:38,949
Don't worry Harold,
I wouldn't forget you.

1300
00:53:39,083 --> 00:53:41,218
I know you like
your hot sauce.

1301
00:53:41,352 --> 00:53:42,720
[grumbles happily]

1302
00:53:42,853 --> 00:53:45,323
All right.
So what do we got?

1303
00:53:45,456 --> 00:53:46,991
Nothing about Kubot
except his address

1304
00:53:47,124 --> 00:53:48,493
and that he's an
antiques dealer.

1305
00:53:48,626 --> 00:53:50,295
What about the plant
Kubot mentioned?

1306
00:53:50,428 --> 00:53:52,029
Maybe it's a giant
man-eating plant.

1307
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:54,131
Maybe. But in
the real world

1308
00:53:54,265 --> 00:53:56,267
a plant can also mean
a factory or a warehouse.

1309
00:53:56,401 --> 00:53:58,336
But what about the blue truck
they put the coffin in?

1310
00:53:58,469 --> 00:53:59,770
It had a penguin on it.

1311
00:53:59,904 --> 00:54:01,406
If we could figure out
what the penguin stood for,

1312
00:54:01,539 --> 00:54:03,341
we might be able to figure out
where the truck came from

1313
00:54:03,474 --> 00:54:04,909
and where the coffin is.

1314
00:54:05,042 --> 00:54:06,243
[knocking at door]

1315
00:54:06,377 --> 00:54:07,177
[grumbles]

1316
00:54:07,312 --> 00:54:08,979
We're kinda busy right now,
Mom.

1317
00:54:09,113 --> 00:54:10,381
Kubot:
Oh, I'm nobody's mom.

1318
00:54:10,515 --> 00:54:12,116
[frightened grumbles]

1319
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:17,054
It's Kubot!
What's he doing here?

1320
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:19,156
If he sees Harold
we're done.

1321
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:21,392
Whichever one of you
is Gilbert Anderson,

1322
00:54:21,526 --> 00:54:23,628
I'd like to return something
to you that you dropped.

1323
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:26,931
In my basement.

1324
00:54:27,064 --> 00:54:28,433
My inhaler!

1325
00:54:28,566 --> 00:54:29,867
I was wondering
where that was.

1326
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,002
No use, kiddywinkies.
I know what you took

1327
00:54:32,136 --> 00:54:33,904
and I intend to get it back.

1328
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:36,341
-[grumbles]
-Now open the door!

1329
00:54:36,474 --> 00:54:37,575
[pounding on door]

1330
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:39,076
No, quiet, Harold!

1331
00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:40,445
What do we do,
what do we do?

1332
00:54:40,578 --> 00:54:42,413
We've got to draw them away
so they don't see Harold.

1333
00:54:42,547 --> 00:54:44,415
Wait. I know a way out.

1334
00:54:44,549 --> 00:54:45,816
Great. Harold,
you stay here.

1335
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:47,552
[pounding on door]

1336
00:54:47,685 --> 00:54:48,786
This way.

1337
00:54:48,919 --> 00:54:50,388
-Come on, open it!
-Come on!

1338
00:54:50,955 --> 00:54:52,457
Break it down.

1339
00:54:54,725 --> 00:54:55,726
[grunts]

1340
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:56,894
Harold stay!

1341
00:54:57,027 --> 00:54:58,228
Kubot: I warned you!

1342
00:54:58,363 --> 00:54:59,664
[grunting]

1343
00:55:00,398 --> 00:55:02,232
Okay, coast is clear.
Let's go.

1344
00:55:02,367 --> 00:55:03,768
Kubot: Come on!

1345
00:55:04,835 --> 00:55:06,036
Marshall: Hey, over here!

1346
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:07,071
The kids!

1347
00:55:07,204 --> 00:55:08,172
Gilbert: Later Killbot.

1348
00:55:11,208 --> 00:55:12,109
[gasps]

1349
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:14,044
Go, go, go, go, run!

1350
00:55:14,178 --> 00:55:15,212
Whoa!

1351
00:55:16,113 --> 00:55:17,482
Lose something?

1352
00:55:17,882 --> 00:55:19,216
Uh, thanks?

1353
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:21,919
I don't know how you kids
managed to steal that mummy,

1354
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:22,987
but I want it back.

1355
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,589
Mummy? Either of you
see a mummy?

1356
00:55:24,722 --> 00:55:25,990
Uh, nope, haven't seen one.

1357
00:55:26,123 --> 00:55:28,559
-Me neither.
-I am not a patient man!

1358
00:55:28,693 --> 00:55:30,761
Tell us where the mummy is,
we'll go our separate ways.

1359
00:55:30,895 --> 00:55:32,062
No harm, no foul.

1360
00:55:32,196 --> 00:55:34,098
If we tell you, you promise
to leave us alone?

1361
00:55:34,231 --> 00:55:36,100
Yeah, you have my word
of honor.

1362
00:55:37,034 --> 00:55:38,369
He's right behind you.

1363
00:55:38,503 --> 00:55:39,537
What the?

1364
00:55:40,037 --> 00:55:41,772
That thing can't be
a mummy.

1365
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:43,541
Oh yeah, yeah.
It's him.

1366
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:44,775
But it's alive!

1367
00:55:44,909 --> 00:55:45,643
I mean, grab him!

1368
00:55:45,776 --> 00:55:46,677
Grab him now!

1369
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:49,313
[fighting grunts]

1370
00:55:49,447 --> 00:55:50,481
[grunts]

1371
00:55:55,052 --> 00:55:55,986
Ow!

1372
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,688
This would be a good time
to go.

1373
00:55:57,822 --> 00:55:59,056
Come on, Harold!

1374
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:02,226
-Come on!
-Come on!

1375
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:04,629
Amy: Hurry, come on!

1376
00:56:05,463 --> 00:56:07,031
What was that?

1377
00:56:08,065 --> 00:56:09,700
I remember reading about
the legend of reanimation.

1378
00:56:09,834 --> 00:56:11,836
But I thought it was
a superstition.

1379
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:14,805
That thing was the mummy
we stole?

1380
00:56:14,939 --> 00:56:17,675
Yes. And my price
for it just went up.

1381
00:56:19,176 --> 00:56:20,277
Way up!

1382
00:56:20,411 --> 00:56:21,879
This is really, really bad.

1383
00:56:22,012 --> 00:56:23,213
What do we do?

1384
00:56:23,347 --> 00:56:25,483
We can't go home with Kubot
looking for us.

1385
00:56:25,616 --> 00:56:26,951
We gotta find a place to hide
for a while.

1386
00:56:27,084 --> 00:56:28,686
Ted: Marshall!

1387
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,357
Hey gang.

1388
00:56:33,491 --> 00:56:35,159
Hey Harold.
It's Harold, isn't it?

1389
00:56:35,292 --> 00:56:36,193
[grumbles]

1390
00:56:36,326 --> 00:56:37,294
[laughs]

1391
00:56:37,428 --> 00:56:38,362
I thought you finished
your movie.

1392
00:56:38,496 --> 00:56:40,230
We're doing some
extra scenes.

1393
00:56:40,364 --> 00:56:41,599
-Yeah.
-Yeah, extra scenes.

1394
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:42,867
-We're filming.
-Yeah.

1395
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,602
But what are you supposed
to be dressed as?

1396
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:45,936
Oh.

1397
00:56:46,604 --> 00:56:48,138
I'm the Hallow-Easter Bunny.

1398
00:56:48,272 --> 00:56:49,239
[laughs weakly]

1399
00:56:49,373 --> 00:56:50,475
What are, what are you
doing here?

1400
00:56:50,608 --> 00:56:52,176
I just picked up some more
Halloween candy.

1401
00:56:52,309 --> 00:56:53,478
Don't want anyone to go away
empty-handed tonight.

1402
00:56:53,611 --> 00:56:54,545
[grumbles curiously]

1403
00:56:54,679 --> 00:56:56,080
You want to help me
pass it out?

1404
00:56:56,213 --> 00:56:57,948
We're actually going
to the...

1405
00:56:58,082 --> 00:56:59,283
Halloween carnival
at school.

1406
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:00,985
-Yeah!
-Yeah, the Halloween carnival.

1407
00:57:01,118 --> 00:57:02,753
Does Morse Park Middle
School still do its
Halloween carnival?

1408
00:57:02,887 --> 00:57:04,989
I used to love that
when I was a kid.

1409
00:57:05,122 --> 00:57:06,557
Ah, ah, ah.
No Harold.

1410
00:57:06,691 --> 00:57:08,258
No treats for you
in there.

1411
00:57:08,392 --> 00:57:10,060
You know, we really should
be going now.

1412
00:57:10,194 --> 00:57:11,361
Yeah.

1413
00:57:11,496 --> 00:57:12,463
Okay.

1414
00:57:13,598 --> 00:57:15,500
-Ted, you grew up in
this town, right?
-Mmm-hmm.

1415
00:57:15,633 --> 00:57:17,334
Do you remember a company
that used a blue truck

1416
00:57:17,468 --> 00:57:18,335
with a penguin on it?

1417
00:57:19,369 --> 00:57:21,572
Erin's Ice Cream.
Best ice cream ever.

1418
00:57:21,706 --> 00:57:23,841
Every kid in town cried the day
they went out of business.

1419
00:57:23,974 --> 00:57:26,010
Do they have a factory
or a plant in town?

1420
00:57:26,143 --> 00:57:29,313
Not exactly in town,
but out on Route 12.

1421
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,348
When I was a kid we went there
on a field trip.

1422
00:57:31,482 --> 00:57:33,050
Still there,
sitting empty.

1423
00:57:33,684 --> 00:57:34,819
Why?

1424
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:37,421
We have an upcoming
school project on local history.

1425
00:57:37,555 --> 00:57:38,422
Bye!

1426
00:57:38,556 --> 00:57:39,557
I'm happy to help you
with it.

1427
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:41,091
Marshall: Yeah.
We'll be in touch!

1428

Nice work.

1430
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:47,331
He's a nice guy.

1431
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:48,232
Ugh.

00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,235
Hmm.

1435
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:55,940
Happy Hallow...

1436
00:57:56,541 --> 00:57:57,742
Mr. Kubot.

1437
00:57:58,175 --> 00:57:59,376
Trick or treating?

1438
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:01,145
Ha! No.

1439
00:58:01,278 --> 00:58:03,047
I was wondering
if your son

1440
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:05,015
would like to make
a little extra money.

1441
00:58:05,149 --> 00:58:07,952
I need someone to, um,
do some yard work.

1442
00:58:08,085 --> 00:58:09,486
[chuckles awkwardly]
Good idea.

1443
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:11,889
But I'm sorry, he's not here
at the moment, so...

1444
00:58:12,022 --> 00:58:12,823
I don't think...

1445
00:58:12,957 --> 00:58:13,791
-Hey.
-Hi.

1446
00:58:13,924 --> 00:58:15,526
Pardon me.
Here we go.

1447
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:18,362
Three extra tons of sugar rush
for the local kids.

1448
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,797
Thanks, hon.

1449
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:23,200
Uh, Mr. Kubot here would like
to offer Marshall a job.

1450
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,969
Oh. I just saw him
down the street.

1451
00:58:25,102 --> 00:58:26,971
-Really?
-He was with his friends,

1452
00:58:27,104 --> 00:58:28,806
including the big one
dressed like a mummy.

1453
00:58:28,939 --> 00:58:30,074
Oh?

1454
00:58:30,207 --> 00:58:32,543
But they all took off
for the Halloween carnival.

1455
00:58:32,677 --> 00:58:34,411
I'll catch up
with you later.

1456
00:58:34,545 --> 00:58:35,412
Thank you.

1457
00:58:36,981 --> 00:58:38,916
Mom:
Good night, Mr. Kubot.

1458
00:58:39,617 --> 00:58:42,386
Okay. How do we get Harold out
to that ice cream factory?

1459
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,088
It has to be at least
10 miles out of town.

1460
00:58:44,221 --> 00:58:46,757
Yeah. And I don't see
asking our parents to
give us a ride.

1461
00:58:47,457 --> 00:58:49,760
Buzzy!
Buzzy can drive us!

1462
00:58:49,894 --> 00:58:52,296
Come on.
She's working the haunted house
at the Halloween carnival.

1463
00:58:52,429 --> 00:58:53,931
But we need costumes
to get in,

1464
00:58:54,064 --> 00:58:55,633
and ours are back
at our houses.

1465
00:58:55,766 --> 00:58:56,867
We're just going to have
to improvise.

1466
00:58:57,001 --> 00:58:57,868
Come on.

1467
00:58:58,502 --> 00:58:59,937
[grumbling]

1468
00:59:01,305 --> 00:59:03,674
Amy, how come you're
the only one out of all of us

1469
00:59:03,808 --> 00:59:05,710
that looks not so stupid?

1470
00:59:05,843 --> 00:59:08,946
Some people are better
at improvising than others?

1471
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:10,247
Hey. Where's Harold?

1472
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,148
Yeah.

1473
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:12,516
Harold?

1474
00:59:14,585 --> 00:59:16,386
You gotta stick
with us, Harold.

1475
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:17,955
It's not safe
to run off.

1476
00:59:18,088 --> 00:59:19,757
[grumbles]

1477
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:21,358
Does Harold even need
a costume?

1478
00:59:21,491 --> 00:59:23,027
Kubot's looking
for a mummy.

1479
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,528
And Harold's
the Invisible Man.

1480
00:59:24,662 --> 00:59:26,030
It's the perfect disguise
for a mummy.

1481
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:28,332
Come on.

It's okay, Harold.
They're just costumes.

Ah, look at that.

Losers?

1500
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:07,371
You don't need a costume
for that.

1501
01:00:07,504 --> 01:00:08,839
And what are you supposed
to be, Todd?

1502
01:00:08,973 --> 01:00:11,008
I'm a cereal killer.

No. You can wait at the back

We only have to go in
for a minute.

Look for the mummy with
the amulet around his neck.

1637
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:37,601
Amulet?

1638
01:05:37,734 --> 01:05:39,269

Again? How did you know?

1643
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:50,180
You blinked.

01:05:50,314 --> 01:05:51,982
Rats. I've got to work
on that.

Guys. We're kind of
in a hurry.

to wait your turn.

my type, O positive!

Oh, come on.

01:07:08,558 --> 01:07:09,559
Even I don't think
that's scary.

The blood bank
is closed.

1688
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:22,906
Whatever.

1689
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,408
Which way did
the mummy go?

1690
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:26,243
[regular voice]
That way.

1691
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:27,944
Where is everyone's
Halloween spirit?

1692
01:07:28,845 --> 01:07:29,846
I'm parked out back.

1693
01:07:29,979 --> 01:07:31,315
Get the mummy
and meet me there.

1694

He's here!

Kubot's here!
He's right behind us!

1696
01:07:33,583 --> 01:07:34,318
What?

1697
01:07:34,451 --> 01:07:35,385
This way!

1698
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:36,353
Let's go!

1699
01:07:39,223 --> 01:07:41,158
There's a door
behind one of these.

1700
01:07:42,759 --> 01:07:44,628
When you catch up to
that mummy, distract it.

1701
01:07:47,964 --> 01:07:49,566
-Found it.
-Great!

1702
01:07:50,267 --> 01:07:51,701
Hey! Stop right there!

[growling]

1704
01:07:54,304 --> 01:07:56,039
You guys really want
to do this again?

1705
01:07:56,173 --> 01:07:57,374
Listen, we don't want
any trouble.

1706
01:07:57,507 --> 01:07:59,209
This mummy doesn't
belong to you.

1707
01:07:59,343 --> 01:08:00,710
He doesn't belong
to anybody.

1708
01:08:00,844 --> 01:08:02,112
He's a person.

1709
01:08:02,246 --> 01:08:03,480
Or at least he was one.

1710
01:08:03,613 --> 01:08:05,349
-[loud roar]
-What do we do?

1711
01:08:05,482 --> 01:08:07,184
Kubot said to distract it,
so...

1712
01:08:07,317 --> 01:08:08,885
Hey, nice mummy.

1713
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:10,420
Breath mint?

1714
01:08:10,554 --> 01:08:12,622
[roars furiously]

1715
01:08:12,756 --> 01:08:14,158
Okay, he's distracted.
Now what do we do?

1716
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:16,626
-Harold watch out!
-Behind you!

1717
01:08:24,368 --> 01:08:25,402
Harold!

1718
01:08:25,535 --> 01:08:27,437
Pays to know your
ancient history.

1719
01:08:27,571 --> 01:08:28,972
What did you do to him?

1720
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:31,275
The amulet giveth and
the amulet taketh away.

1721
01:08:31,408 --> 01:08:32,609
Okay guys. He's harmless.

1722
01:08:32,742 --> 01:08:34,444
Now let's go. Come on,
we got a buyer waiting.

1723
01:08:34,778 --> 01:08:36,045
Ugh.

1724
01:08:36,346 --> 01:08:37,947
This thing smells rank.

1725
01:08:38,081 --> 01:08:39,883
I don't know, kind of smells
like Ocean Breeze to me.

1726
01:08:42,419 --> 01:08:43,820
If you know
what's good for you

1727
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:45,722
you'll forget
this ever happened.

1728
01:08:52,196 --> 01:08:53,797
[laughs]
Let's go boys.

1729
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:55,365
No!

1730
01:08:55,499 --> 01:08:56,900
[tires screech]

1731
01:08:59,503 --> 01:09:00,704
I failed him!

1732
01:09:00,837 --> 01:09:02,272
Marsh. We did all
we could.

1733
01:09:02,406 --> 01:09:04,140
Yeah. There's nothing else
we could've done.

1734
01:09:04,274 --> 01:09:05,842
No!
He was counting on me

1735
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:07,644
and now he's going
to turn to dust.

1736
01:09:07,777 --> 01:09:09,513
Not necessarily.
There's still a couple
of hours till midnight

1737
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:10,747
and we know they're
taking him

1738
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:11,915
to the old ice cream
factory.

1739
01:09:12,048 --> 01:09:13,350
So what can we do?

1740
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:14,651
Those guys
are dangerous.

1741
01:09:14,784 --> 01:09:15,952
We're going to figure
it out.

1742
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:17,721
All I do know is that
we have to help Harold.

1743
01:09:17,854 --> 01:09:19,256
Friends, backs, remember?

1744
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:21,725
-I'm so in.
-Me too.

1745
01:09:21,858 --> 01:09:23,493
Woah, woah, woah.
I don't know...

1746
01:09:23,627 --> 01:09:25,995
-And Gilbert's in.
-Whoa!

1747
01:09:26,129 --> 01:09:27,197
[door slam]

1748
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:31,335

1749
01:09:33,803 --> 01:09:36,873
*

1750
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:43,913
Any idea just where this
old ice cream factory is?

1751
01:09:44,047 --> 01:09:45,849
I don't know.
Ted just said Route 12.

1752
01:09:45,982 --> 01:09:47,484
This is Route 12.

1753
01:09:47,617 --> 01:09:49,319
And it's over
30 miles long.

1754
01:09:49,453 --> 01:09:50,987
Amy: Here. Let me
try something.

1755
01:09:53,089 --> 01:09:54,658
It's 1600 Oak View Road.

1756
01:09:54,791 --> 01:09:57,160
Turnoff is in five miles
to the right.

1757
01:09:57,294 --> 01:09:59,229
Local history
website has it.

1758
01:09:59,363 --> 01:10:00,730
Impressive.

1759
01:10:00,864 --> 01:10:02,666

[small laugh]

1761

*

1762
01:10:36,266 --> 01:10:38,001
Okay, so here's the plan.

1763
01:10:38,134 --> 01:10:40,103
We breach the parameter of
Kubot's hideout and sneak in.

1764
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:41,371
We breach the what?

1765
01:10:41,505 --> 01:10:42,806
Just go with it.

1766
01:10:42,939 --> 01:10:44,808
Step two,
we create a diversion

1767
01:10:44,941 --> 01:10:46,810
distracting Kubot and his
men away from Harold.

1768
01:10:46,943 --> 01:10:48,011
Step three...

1769
01:10:48,144 --> 01:10:49,779
We put Harold back
into his coffin

1770
01:10:49,913 --> 01:10:51,715
and return him
to the museum

1771
01:10:51,848 --> 01:10:52,882
to be reunited
with his girlfriend.

1772
01:10:53,016 --> 01:10:54,384
And what about Kubot?

1773
01:10:54,518 --> 01:10:55,519
Oh, this is the best part.

1774
01:10:55,652 --> 01:10:57,854
We call it in.
Kubot gets arrested.

1775
01:10:57,987 --> 01:10:59,489
Boom, we're heroes.

1776
01:10:59,623 --> 01:11:01,558
We get a parade,
a movie deal,

1777
01:11:01,691 --> 01:11:04,328
and an A on our
Egyptology project.

1778
01:11:04,461 --> 01:11:05,995
Okay. Great plan.

1779
01:11:06,129 --> 01:11:08,665
Except for one little part.

1780
01:11:08,798 --> 01:11:10,534
-Which part?
-All of it, okay?

1781
01:11:10,667 --> 01:11:12,669
Dude. We're 12. 12!

1782
01:11:12,802 --> 01:11:15,271
One, two.

1783
01:11:15,405 --> 01:11:18,074
I'm still working out
the details.

1784
01:11:18,207 --> 01:11:20,477
If we could figure out
a way to really
distract Kubot,

1785
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:22,646
Marshall's crazy idea
might just work.

1786
01:11:23,813 --> 01:11:25,815
I might be able
to help you.

1787
01:11:25,949 --> 01:11:28,352
Check out those boxes
in the back.

1788
01:11:28,485 --> 01:11:31,388
Strobe lights, web guns,
sound effect machines,

1789
01:11:31,521 --> 01:11:32,889
mega slime,
remote control spider.

1790
01:11:33,022 --> 01:11:34,157
You name it.

1791
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:35,759
There's enough in there
to distract an army.

1792
01:11:35,892 --> 01:11:37,193
Buzzy, you're a genius!

1793
01:11:37,327 --> 01:11:39,396
It's just stuff left over
from the haunted house.

1794
01:11:39,529 --> 01:11:42,031
But I'll take genius
any day.

1795
01:11:44,267 --> 01:11:45,602
Less than an hour
to spare.

1796
01:11:45,735 --> 01:11:47,637
Cutting it close,
eh Kubot?

1797
01:11:47,771 --> 01:11:49,839
Oh, I think once you see
what I have to offer,

1798
01:11:49,973 --> 01:11:52,942
you'll agree it was
well worth the wait.

1799
01:11:54,243 --> 01:11:56,145
Here it is.

1800
01:11:56,913 --> 01:11:59,416
I have waited years
to acquire this

1801
01:11:59,549 --> 01:12:00,984
for my collection.

1802
01:12:01,117 --> 01:12:02,652
Boys?

1803
01:12:09,559 --> 01:12:11,395
Where's the mummy, Kubot?

1804
01:12:11,528 --> 01:12:13,863
No mummy, no deal.
Remember?

1805
01:12:13,997 --> 01:12:17,801
Ah yes, the mummy.
How silly of me.

1806
01:12:17,934 --> 01:12:19,936
Ms. Ravensworth,
if you follow me

1807
01:12:20,069 --> 01:12:22,271
I'll lead you
to your acquisition.

1808
01:12:24,608 --> 01:12:28,344
It's right over... here.

1809
01:12:28,478 --> 01:12:29,813
What on earth?

1810
01:12:29,946 --> 01:12:33,417
Why isn't it in the coffin,
and why is it in chains?

1811
01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:34,984
There's been a new wrinkle.

1812
01:12:35,118 --> 01:12:37,454
It turns out this mummy
is way more valuable

1813
01:12:37,587 --> 01:12:38,688
than we agreed upon.

1814
01:12:38,822 --> 01:12:40,624
Listen Kubot.

1815
01:12:40,757 --> 01:12:42,459
If you think you're
going to squeeze

1816
01:12:42,592 --> 01:12:43,727
more money out of me
at the last minute

1817
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:45,294
you are gravely mistaken.

1818
01:12:45,429 --> 01:12:46,630
We had a deal!

1819
01:12:46,763 --> 01:12:49,899
We did have a deal
for a mummy.

1820
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:52,368
A dead mummy.

1821
01:12:52,502 --> 01:12:54,771
What other kind is there?

1822
01:12:59,308 --> 01:13:01,611
[growls]

1823
01:13:02,679 --> 01:13:04,514
[grumbles]

1824
01:13:07,183 --> 01:13:08,818
[mummy roars]

1825
01:13:08,952 --> 01:13:09,686
[Kubot roars]

1826
01:13:09,819 --> 01:13:10,554
[gasps]

1827
01:13:10,687 --> 01:13:12,155
[both roar]

1828
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:15,892
Convinced?

1829
01:13:16,025 --> 01:13:17,527
This is incredible.

1830
01:13:24,634 --> 01:13:26,670
So, do we renegotiate,

1831
01:13:26,803 --> 01:13:29,005
or do I see if some
other collector

1832
01:13:29,138 --> 01:13:31,541
might like a live mummy
for their collection?

1833
01:13:31,675 --> 01:13:34,077
I am ready to talk.

1834
01:13:39,483 --> 01:13:40,784
Please.

1835
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:42,719
Step into my office.

1836
01:13:49,793 --> 01:13:51,895
Marshall: Look!
It's the penguin truck.

1837
01:13:52,028 --> 01:13:53,563
Amy: Okay. Everyone
ready to do this?

1838
01:13:53,697 --> 01:13:55,799
Buzzy: Okay, but let's make
sure the coast is clear first.

1839
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:59,769
This place is a lot scarier
than I imagined.

1840
01:13:59,903 --> 01:14:02,739
Everything is a lot scarier
than you imagined.

1841
01:14:02,872 --> 01:14:04,608
Uh, Marshall?

1842
01:14:04,741 --> 01:14:06,710
I don't know
if I can do this.

1843
01:14:06,843 --> 01:14:08,512
Come on, Gil.
We're in this together.

1844
01:14:09,879 --> 01:14:12,148
I'm sorry, Marshall.
I can't.

1845
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:14,250
Gilbert, face your fears,
remember?

1846
01:14:14,383 --> 01:14:16,352
This time the fear
is for a good reason.

1847
01:14:16,486 --> 01:14:17,386
Survival!

1848
01:14:17,521 --> 01:14:19,455
But what about Harold?
He's our friend.

1849
01:14:19,589 --> 01:14:20,790
Like Amy said,

1850
01:14:20,924 --> 01:14:23,159
friends have each other's
backs, remember?

1851
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:25,028
Friends don't get each other
killed, Marshall.

1852
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:29,132
I'm sorry but...
I'm out of here.

1853
01:14:30,366 --> 01:14:32,602
Fine! Go home, Gilbert.

1854
01:14:34,237 --> 01:14:36,205
We don't need you anyway.

1855
01:14:40,043 --> 01:14:42,679
Come on, Marshall.
We're running out of time.

1856
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:44,447
*

1857
01:14:50,854 --> 01:14:52,221
Come on.

1858
01:14:52,355 --> 01:14:54,357
Kubot: ...I can
get 10 buyers...

1859
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:58,895
...I can make some
phone calls...

1860
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:00,697
Amy: There's Harold.

1861
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:02,431
... he's gonna get
a million for this...

1862
01:15:02,566 --> 01:15:04,267
Amy: And there's
the amulet.

1863
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:06,369
If taking the amulet off
de-animated Harold,

1864
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:08,938
then wouldn't putting it
back on reanimate him?

1865
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:11,107
Yes!

1866
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,709
Okay. New plan.

1867
01:15:12,842 --> 01:15:14,177
We distract the guards
long enough

1868
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:15,945
to get the amulet
back onto Harold.

1869
01:15:16,079 --> 01:15:18,648
Once he wakes up it's going
to be revenge of the mummy.

1870
01:15:19,382 --> 01:15:20,684
Let's go!

1871
01:15:21,417 --> 01:15:22,485
Like fine.

1872
01:15:22,619 --> 01:15:24,053
There's brave and
then there's stupid,

1873
01:15:24,187 --> 01:15:25,488
and I'm not stupid.

1874
01:15:25,622 --> 01:15:27,390
[loud screech]

1875
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:28,892
Whatever dude.

1876
01:15:29,025 --> 01:15:31,928
I've seen way scarier things
in the last few days.

1877
01:15:32,061 --> 01:15:33,730
Not that anyone cares.

1878
01:15:33,863 --> 01:15:35,231
Face your fears, Gilbert.

1879
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:36,966
Friends have each other's
backs, Gilbert.

1880
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:39,335
I'm so tired of hearing him
say that.

1881
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:41,705
[hooting]

1882
01:15:41,838 --> 01:15:42,972
Marshall, that's who.

1883
01:15:43,106 --> 01:15:44,273
He always says I should
have his back.

1884
01:15:44,407 --> 01:15:45,775
Well, who has my back?

1885
01:15:45,909 --> 01:15:47,210
[hoots]

1886
01:15:47,343 --> 01:15:48,444
Me. That's "hoo-hoo."

1887
01:15:48,578 --> 01:15:50,847
Look, you can stare
all you want

1888
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:52,115
but I'm not going
back there.

1889
01:15:52,248 --> 01:15:53,349
It's scary.

1890
01:15:53,482 --> 01:15:56,219
But this wasn't just scary,

1891
01:15:56,352 --> 01:15:58,922
it was real dangerous.

1892
01:15:59,055 --> 01:16:01,591
And my friends are right
in the middle of it.

1893
01:16:01,725 --> 01:16:03,292
[sighs]

1894
01:16:03,426 --> 01:16:05,995
But Professor Glunditchberg
never runs from danger.

1895
01:16:06,129 --> 01:16:08,865
Yeah. We must face
our fears!

1896
01:16:08,998 --> 01:16:10,499
[hoots]

1897
01:16:10,634 --> 01:16:12,435
Yeah.

1898
01:16:14,337 --> 01:16:15,839
-Stinks.
-Right?

1899
01:16:15,972 --> 01:16:18,341
I'm still smelling
Ocean Breeze.

1900
01:16:18,474 --> 01:16:20,076
[ghostly screaming]

1901
01:16:20,209 --> 01:16:21,344
What is that?

1902
01:16:21,477 --> 01:16:23,246
[metal clanking]

1903
01:16:23,379 --> 01:16:24,714
Better check it out.

1904
01:16:24,848 --> 01:16:27,283
We'll check out this side,
you check out the other.

1905
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:28,685
Come on.

1906
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:34,357
*

1907
01:16:37,293 --> 01:16:40,229
[ghostly laughing]

1908
01:16:42,999 --> 01:16:44,333
[laughing stops]

1909
01:16:45,168 --> 01:16:47,536
Someone's playing a joke?

1910
01:16:47,671 --> 01:16:48,604
Doesn't even look real.

1911
01:16:48,738 --> 01:16:49,973
Right? Look at this...

1912
01:16:50,106 --> 01:16:51,174
[loud roar]

1913
01:16:51,307 --> 01:16:52,642
Didn't blink that time!

1914
01:16:52,776 --> 01:16:54,844
[howls]

1915
01:16:54,978 --> 01:16:56,312
-Hey!
-Stop!

1916
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:58,915
*

1917
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:07,490
[chitters]

1918
01:17:13,229 --> 01:17:15,765
"Step into my parlor"
said the spider to the creep.

1919
01:17:20,770 --> 01:17:22,171
[gasps]

1920
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:27,310
*

1921
01:17:35,919 --> 01:17:38,487
It's okay, Harold.
I've got you.

1922
01:17:47,897 --> 01:17:48,832
Hey!

1923
01:17:48,965 --> 01:17:50,499
What do you think
you're doing?

1924
01:17:50,633 --> 01:17:53,069
Hey, hey!
Let me go!

1925
01:17:53,202 --> 01:17:55,371
Look what we found.

1926
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:57,741
You're going to be
in big trouble.

1927
01:17:57,874 --> 01:17:59,075
Let me go!

1928
01:17:59,208 --> 01:18:01,344
I said let me go!

1929
01:18:01,477 --> 01:18:04,080
There was originally
four kids.

1930
01:18:04,213 --> 01:18:05,481
Where's the other one?

1931
01:18:05,614 --> 01:18:06,716
He's telling every
adult we know

1932
01:18:06,850 --> 01:18:08,517
and they're all coming
to get you.

1933
01:18:08,651 --> 01:18:09,986
Somehow I'm doubting that.

1934
01:18:10,119 --> 01:18:11,955
Where did these kids
come from?

1935
01:18:12,088 --> 01:18:13,022
Don't worry about it.
I'll handle them.

1936
01:18:13,156 --> 01:18:14,891
But they've seen
our faces.

1937
01:18:15,024 --> 01:18:17,060
Like I said...
I'll handle them.

1938
01:18:17,193 --> 01:18:18,594
What does he mean
by that?

1939
01:18:18,728 --> 01:18:19,896
I don't want to find out.

1940
01:18:20,029 --> 01:18:22,298
So Ms. Ravensworth,
shall we wrap this up?

1941
01:18:22,431 --> 01:18:23,833
No pun intended.

1942
01:18:23,967 --> 01:18:25,234
Please!

1943
01:18:25,368 --> 01:18:27,703
You need to put the mummy
back into his coffin. Now!

1944
01:18:27,837 --> 01:18:29,105
What?

1945
01:18:29,238 --> 01:18:30,807
If you don't he'll turn
to dust at midnight, honest.

1946
01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:32,208
What are they
talking about?

1947
01:18:32,341 --> 01:18:33,342
They're stalling for time.

1948
01:18:33,476 --> 01:18:34,410
No, it's written
on the amulet.

1949
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:36,212
He'll turn to dust
at midnight.

1950
01:18:36,345 --> 01:18:37,613
What if they're telling
the truth?

1951
01:18:37,747 --> 01:18:39,182
They're just kids,
what do they know?

1952
01:18:39,315 --> 01:18:40,383
Please!

1953
01:18:40,516 --> 01:18:41,617
We'll forget we ever
saw any of this.

1954
01:18:41,751 --> 01:18:43,152
You can keep the mummy.

1955
01:18:43,286 --> 01:18:46,722
Just please, please put him back
into his coffin.

1956
01:18:46,856 --> 01:18:48,758
-He's our friend.
-Put a cork in it.

1957
01:18:50,193 --> 01:18:52,028
That other little
punk kid's

1958
01:18:52,161 --> 01:18:53,162
got to be around
here someplace.

1959
01:18:53,296 --> 01:18:54,397
Gilbert: Right here!

1960
01:18:55,531 --> 01:18:56,866
Both: Gilbert?

1961
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,168
Professor Glunditchberg
to the rescue.

1962
01:18:59,302 --> 01:19:00,403
Go round him up.

1963
01:19:00,536 --> 01:19:01,871
Amy: Watch out.

1964
01:19:02,005 --> 01:19:03,406
Get the amulet, Gil!

1965
01:19:04,808 --> 01:19:06,475
Marshall: You got this, Gil.

1966
01:19:11,915 --> 01:19:13,682
Whoa!

1967
01:19:13,817 --> 01:19:16,485
[screaming]
Ahhhhh!!!!!

1968
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:19,555
Whoa!!!!!

1969
01:19:21,224 --> 01:19:22,625
All: Ooh!

1970
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:24,994
Gil, are you okay?

1971
01:19:25,128 --> 01:19:26,595
Gilbert?

1972
01:19:30,834 --> 01:19:31,734
All: Yes!

1973
01:19:31,868 --> 01:19:33,036
Get him!

1974
01:19:33,169 --> 01:19:34,003
Kubot: Get that amulet!

1975
01:19:34,137 --> 01:19:35,371
Watch out, Gilbert!

1976
01:19:35,504 --> 01:19:36,739
No.

1977
01:19:36,873 --> 01:19:38,041
I want no trouble here.

1978
01:19:38,174 --> 01:19:39,242
Give it up kid.

1979
01:19:39,375 --> 01:19:40,643
Come on kid,
hand it over.

1980
01:19:41,244 --> 01:19:42,711
Please.

1981
01:19:42,846 --> 01:19:43,947
Hey Gil.

1982
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:45,048
How'd you like to win
something way cooler

1983
01:19:45,181 --> 01:19:45,982
than a purple-eyed panda?

1984
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:47,650

Ah! Oh! Rats!

1987
01:19:53,456 --> 01:19:55,658
But I haven't been
too lucky tonight.

1988
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:57,093
I believe in you.

1989
01:19:57,226 --> 01:19:58,527
Come on, kid.
Last warning.

1990
01:19:58,661 --> 01:20:00,263
Give up the amulet.

1991
01:20:00,396 --> 01:20:01,230
Come on.

1992

[grunts]

1993
01:20:17,113 --> 01:20:18,514
Yes!

1994

Kids: Yes!!!

1995
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:21,017
No!

1996
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:22,919
Amy: You did it!

1997
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:27,023
[loud roar]

1998
01:20:28,257 --> 01:20:29,658
Get that mummy!

Marshall: Way to go, Harold.

2001
01:20:42,638 --> 01:20:43,873
Harold, watch out!

2002
01:20:44,007 --> 01:20:45,308
Get him!

2003
01:20:45,441 --> 01:20:47,143
Gilbert: You got this, Harold.

2004

Yes!

Argh!

2009
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:58,087
Woah!

2010
01:20:58,221 --> 01:20:59,455
Let's get out of here!

2011
01:20:59,588 --> 01:21:01,390
Amy: They're getting away.

2012
01:21:01,524 --> 01:21:02,791
I've got this.

2013
01:21:02,926 --> 01:21:04,060
Buzzy: Don't worry.

2014
01:21:04,193 --> 01:21:05,528
They're heading
right into our trap.

2015
01:21:06,295 --> 01:21:07,496
[beeps]

2016
01:21:08,731 --> 01:21:09,765
Yes!

2017
01:21:14,270 --> 01:21:15,538
Nicely done.

2018
01:21:15,671 --> 01:21:18,607
To do that required
great... skull.

2019
01:21:18,741 --> 01:21:19,976
[laughing]

2020
01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:23,512
All: Harold!

2021
01:21:28,517 --> 01:21:30,686
I want my mummy.

2022
01:21:30,819 --> 01:21:32,488
You sure picked the wrong
mummy to mess with.

2023
01:21:32,621 --> 01:21:34,223
And the wrong kids.

2024
01:21:34,357 --> 01:21:35,391
Yeah, you did.

2025
01:21:35,524 --> 01:21:37,393
But you picked exactly
the right Buzzy.

2026
01:21:37,526 --> 01:21:39,963
And she just called
the authorities.

2027
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:41,364
[laughing]

2028
01:21:41,497 --> 01:21:43,832
So what made you come back,
Professor Glunditchberg?

2029
01:21:43,967 --> 01:21:45,969
Yeah. I thought
you were scared.

2030
01:21:46,102 --> 01:21:48,137
You know, I realized
I was more scared

2031
01:21:48,271 --> 01:21:50,306
of losing you all
than I was of those guys.

2032
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:54,310
Losing you would make my world
really, really small.

2033
01:21:54,443 --> 01:21:56,845
We are big world people,
right?

2034
01:21:56,980 --> 01:21:58,414
All: Yeah.

2035
01:21:58,547 --> 01:21:59,648
Yeah, we are.

2036
01:21:59,782 --> 01:22:01,117
Now let's grab
the coffin

2037
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:02,718
and get Harold back
to the museum.

2038
01:22:02,851 --> 01:22:04,453
-Right.
-Let's go.

2039
01:22:06,789 --> 01:22:08,557
Oh no, it's destroyed!

2040
01:22:08,691 --> 01:22:09,959
What are we going
to do now?

2041
01:22:10,093 --> 01:22:11,760
[sad groaning]

2042
01:22:11,894 --> 01:22:14,163
Midnight is
in 28 minutes.

2043
01:22:14,297 --> 01:22:16,132
What about the empty coffin
in the museum?

2044
01:22:16,265 --> 01:22:18,034
The one everyone
took photos in?

2045
01:22:18,167 --> 01:22:19,535
Both: Mummy!

2046
01:22:19,668 --> 01:22:20,736
That's a great idea.

2047
01:22:20,869 --> 01:22:22,271
Yeah, but it's just
a reproduction.

2048
01:22:22,405 --> 01:22:23,739
I'm not sure
it would work.

2049
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:25,074
It's the only choice
we've got.

2050
01:22:25,208 --> 01:22:26,342
Come on.

2051
01:22:26,475 --> 01:22:27,643

Come on.

2056
01:22:44,994 --> 01:22:46,562
Harold, do your stuff.

[alarm blaring]

2058
01:22:51,534 --> 01:22:53,069
-Let's go!
-Hurry!

2059
01:22:53,202 --> 01:22:55,738
I'll wait here for the
authorities and stall them.

2060
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:57,573
Okay, Harold.

2061
01:22:57,706 --> 01:23:00,109
You grab the coffin
and we'll grab the lid.

2062
01:23:00,243 --> 01:23:01,910
Come on.

2063
01:23:09,085 --> 01:23:11,087
Marshall: Harold,
what are you doing?

2064
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:13,122
Get back in your coffin.
It's almost midnight.

2065
01:23:14,490 --> 01:23:15,924
What is he doing?

2066
01:23:16,059 --> 01:23:18,894
I think I know.
He's bringing her...

2067
01:23:19,028 --> 01:23:20,563
Both: To the moonlight!

01:23:59,835 --> 01:24:02,205
Come on, Harold.
We're running out of time.

2072
01:24:02,338 --> 01:24:03,672
Cut him some slack.

2073
01:24:03,806 --> 01:24:06,375
He hasn't seen his girlfriend
in like 4,000 years.

2074
01:24:10,446 --> 01:24:12,315
Look how happy he is.

2075
01:24:12,448 --> 01:24:15,050
People who make each other
happy should be together.

2076
01:24:15,184 --> 01:24:16,652
Even mummies.

2077
01:24:16,785 --> 01:24:17,920
Hmm.

2078
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:19,455
Think they'll be
with each other

2079
01:24:19,588 --> 01:24:20,856
in the afterlife?

2080
01:24:20,989 --> 01:24:22,958
Not if he doesn't get
his butt in that coffin.

2081
01:24:23,092 --> 01:24:24,627
Come on Harold, please.

2082
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:26,162

I'll never call this
town boring again.

Bye, Harold.

I always thought that
it would be really cool

2092

to see a real
live monster.

2093
01:25:16,879 --> 01:25:19,615
[tearfully]
And I was right.

2094

But... bye Harold.

TV Reporter: And in a strange
turn of events,

2106
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:42,731
last night an ancient
Egyptian mummy

2107
01:26:42,865 --> 01:26:44,767
that had been stolen
in transit

2108
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:46,302
to the local museum

2109
01:26:46,435 --> 01:26:48,203
mysteriously turned up there

2110
01:26:48,337 --> 01:26:50,205
holding a bottle
of hot sauce.

2111
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:52,241
Come on.

2112
01:26:52,375 --> 01:26:53,809
Don't dilly-dally.
I don't want you to be late.

2113
01:26:53,942 --> 01:26:55,411
And in related news,

2114
01:26:55,544 --> 01:26:57,045
an anonymous tip
led to the arrest

2115
01:26:57,179 --> 01:26:58,714
of several local residents

2116
01:26:58,847 --> 01:27:00,549
believed to have stolen
the mummy

2117
01:27:00,683 --> 01:27:02,117
along with many
other valuable...

2118
01:27:02,251 --> 01:27:04,186
You haven't seen the TV remote,
have you?

2119
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:07,490
You know, I have a feeling
it'll eventually turn up.

2120
01:27:07,623 --> 01:27:08,857
Or down.

2121
01:27:08,991 --> 01:27:10,225
Speaking of mummies,

2122
01:27:10,359 --> 01:27:13,596
a dancer dressed as a mummy
put Walgrove on the map.

2123
01:27:13,729 --> 01:27:17,065
He was the hit
at a local middle school
Halloween carnival,

2124
01:27:17,199 --> 01:27:19,968
and then he took
social media by storm.

2125
01:27:20,102 --> 01:27:21,203
No way!

2126
01:27:21,337 --> 01:27:22,738
He's a bona fide star,

2127
01:27:22,871 --> 01:27:25,441
even though nobody can seem
to figure out who he is.

2128

[doorbell rings]

2129
01:27:26,809 --> 01:27:28,243
Oh, can you get that?
That's probably Ted.

2130
01:27:28,377 --> 01:27:30,245
He's coming over
for a late breakfast.

2131
01:27:31,246 --> 01:27:33,716
Ted. How you doing?
Good to see ya.

2132
01:27:34,417 --> 01:27:35,651
Really?

2133
01:27:35,784 --> 01:27:36,619
Really.

01:27:40,356 --> 01:27:42,591
Do you know you have a bunch
of boxes of birdseed

2136
01:27:42,725 --> 01:27:44,159
on your front porch?

2137
01:27:44,293 --> 01:27:45,461
Also, hi.

2138
01:27:45,594 --> 01:27:47,296
Weird. Hi.

2139
01:27:47,430 --> 01:27:49,231
I didn't know what kind of
pastries you like.

2140
01:27:49,365 --> 01:27:50,566
So I bought one
of everything.

2141
01:27:50,699 --> 01:27:52,668
Well, nothing says breakfast
like dessert.

2142
01:27:52,801 --> 01:27:54,069
[laughs]

2143
01:27:58,006 --> 01:27:59,274
Hey Ted.

2144
01:27:59,408 --> 01:28:02,110
So I'm thinking my next movie's
going to be about a vampire

2145
01:28:02,244 --> 01:28:04,246
and I could definitely use
your help.

2146
01:28:06,214 --> 01:28:09,618
Uh... Sure.
I'd love to.

2147
01:28:09,752 --> 01:28:12,955
[Dracula voice]
I've always wanted
to play a vampire.

2148
01:28:13,088 --> 01:28:15,391
Actually, you'd be
its victim.

2149
01:28:15,524 --> 01:28:17,860
Ah, ok, that sounds good.

2150
01:28:17,993 --> 01:28:19,628
I'm in.

2151
01:28:19,762 --> 01:28:21,464
Cool.

2152
01:28:22,097 --> 01:28:24,567
Uh, I'm going to go wash
my hands

2153
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:25,968
because I definitely sampled

2154
01:28:26,101 --> 01:28:27,536
one or two of those
on the way over here.

2155
01:28:27,670 --> 01:28:29,405
[laughs]

2156
01:28:30,673 --> 01:28:31,740
Come on.

2157
01:28:31,874 --> 01:28:33,376
Ooooh.

2158
01:28:33,509 --> 01:28:36,979
So why the sudden change
in attitude towards Ted?

2159
01:28:37,112 --> 01:28:40,148
Well, he makes you happy,
doesn't he?

2160
01:28:40,282 --> 01:28:42,585
Yeah, he does.

2161
01:28:42,718 --> 01:28:44,319
People who make
each other happy.

2162
01:28:44,453 --> 01:28:46,088
They should be together.

2163
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:48,791
I love you.

2164
01:28:48,924 --> 01:28:51,627
*

2165
01:29:02,037 --> 01:29:03,372
Oh.

2166
01:29:06,609 --> 01:29:07,810
Hey guys.

2167
01:29:07,943 --> 01:29:10,178
Don't freak out
or anything,

2168
01:29:10,312 --> 01:29:12,415
but you're looking at
the Morse Park Middle
School Gazette's

2169
01:29:12,548 --> 01:29:13,982
newest star reporter.

2170
01:29:14,116 --> 01:29:15,784
-Hey!
-Congrats.

2171
01:29:15,918 --> 01:29:17,019
That's amazing.

2172
01:29:17,152 --> 01:29:18,854
Yeah. I pitched them
the inside scoop

2173
01:29:18,987 --> 01:29:20,756
of the whole mummy story
and they loved it.

2174
01:29:20,889 --> 01:29:22,157
What?

2175
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:23,726
Wait a minute,
inside scoop?

2176
01:29:23,859 --> 01:29:25,160
Yeah. The whole story.

2177
01:29:25,293 --> 01:29:26,962
Well, except for
the whole part

2178
01:29:27,095 --> 01:29:28,464
about the mummy
coming back to life

2179
01:29:28,597 --> 01:29:30,098
and us singlehandedly
bringing down Kubot.

2180
01:29:30,232 --> 01:29:31,634
[sigh of relief]

2181
01:29:31,767 --> 01:29:33,602
That part I'm saving
for my autobiography.

2182
01:29:33,736 --> 01:29:34,970
[laughs]

2183
01:29:35,103 --> 01:29:35,971
Well at least this gives you
something to do

2184
01:29:36,104 --> 01:29:37,540
before you move back
to Rockport.

2185
01:29:37,673 --> 01:29:40,208
You know, Rockport
is nice and all

2186
01:29:40,342 --> 01:29:44,012
but I never would've met
a live mummy there.

2187
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:46,014
Or you guys.

2188
01:29:46,148 --> 01:29:47,750
I think I'm going
to stick around.

2189
01:29:47,883 --> 01:29:48,951
Hmm.

2190
01:29:49,652 --> 01:29:51,420
So what do you guys do
for fun in this town

2191
01:29:51,554 --> 01:29:53,021
when you don't have
a mummy around?

2192
01:29:53,155 --> 01:29:54,657
How about we go see
Warthead?

2193
01:29:54,790 --> 01:29:56,625
-You?
-What?

2194
01:29:56,759 --> 01:29:57,860
No way!

2195
01:29:57,993 --> 01:29:59,227
What? We still haven't
seen the ending, right?

2196
01:29:59,361 --> 01:30:01,730
We? I thought you didn't
like scary movies.

2197
01:30:01,864 --> 01:30:04,433
Look, I brought a mummy
back to life

2198
01:30:04,567 --> 01:30:06,702
and helped take down
that evil next door neighbor.

2199
01:30:06,835 --> 01:30:08,437
How scary can a monster
movie be?

2200
01:30:08,571 --> 01:30:10,005
[inhales]

2201
01:30:10,138 --> 01:30:11,807
Sounds like a plan.

2202
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:13,509
Wait until you see
the ending.

2203
01:30:13,642 --> 01:30:14,843
It's awesome.
Warthead jumps...

2204
01:30:14,977 --> 01:30:16,745
Hey, hey, hey!
No spoilers.

2205
01:30:16,879 --> 01:30:17,913

2206
01:30:18,046 --> 01:30:18,947
