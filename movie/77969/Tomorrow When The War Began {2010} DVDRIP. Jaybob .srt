<i>I'm not gonna hold back.</i>

3
00:00:23,563 --> 00:00:26,171
<i>I warned the others
that I wouldn't.</i>

4
00:00:26,364 --> 00:00:30,206
<i>Recording it like this
is so important to us.</i>

5
00:00:30,873 --> 00:00:34,700
<i>I guess it's our way of telling
ourselves that we matter.</i>

6
00:00:36,942 --> 00:00:39,831
<i>That we mean something.</i>

7
00:00:40,043 --> 00:00:42,527
<i>Maybe...</i>

8
00:00:43,141 --> 00:00:45,875
<i>some of the things we've done...</i>

9
00:00:46,093 --> 00:00:49,428
<i>and the friends that we've lost...</i>

10
00:00:50,279 --> 00:00:54,060
<i>hopefully it all makes
a difference somehow.</i>

11
00:00:58,882 --> 00:01:01,677
<i>There's only one way to do this.</i>

12
00:01:01,778 --> 00:01:05,402
<i>And that's to go back
to where it all began.</i>

13
00:02:16,316 --> 00:02:18,775
What, with Kevin? When?

14
00:02:18,924 --> 00:02:21,594
Last night. He came over
to help with the shearing.

15
00:02:21,695 --> 00:02:24,151
Some sheep got out
and dad went after them.

16
00:02:24,252 --> 00:02:26,652
We were all by ourselves
for, like, 20 minutes.

17
00:02:26,753 --> 00:02:30,573
You did it in a shearing shed?
-In the bed of soft pure merino wool.

18
00:02:30,674 --> 00:02:33,058
My God, you're such a nimpho.

19
00:02:33,203 --> 00:02:36,832
You can talk, Ellie. What about you
and Steve at rehearsals last year.

20
00:02:36,933 --> 00:02:40,333
Oh please, we never went that far.
-Now... pinky swear not to tell.

21
00:02:40,445 --> 00:02:44,230
Pinky swear? Is that not something
we stopped doing in second grade?

22
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:47,680
<i>Corrie's been my best mate
for as long as I can remember.</i>

23
00:02:47,781 --> 00:02:50,241
<i>Whenever I had a problem,
I'd go tell Corrie</i>

24
00:02:50,342 --> 00:02:53,142
<i>and somehow, she'd always fix it.</i>

25
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,916
So, how was it?
-Well, not how I expected.

26
00:02:58,217 --> 00:03:01,817
I feel different somehow.
Like a real woman.

27
00:03:02,025 --> 00:03:05,801
I wanna do more, see more.
I wanna be more.

28
00:03:05,905 --> 00:03:07,936
What would you wanna do?

29
00:03:08,037 --> 00:03:10,337
How about a trip before
we get back to school?

30
00:03:10,437 --> 00:03:12,996
We haven't been
at the river in ages. -Sure.

31
00:03:13,098 --> 00:03:15,422
Maybe dad will let us
have a Landrover.

32
00:03:15,523 --> 00:03:17,763
Maybe Kevin can come with us?

33
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:21,955
I see. You'd like to have more sex,
is that it? -No... Well, yeah.

34
00:03:22,247 --> 00:03:24,650
Look, we'll get a bunch
of us together and...

35
00:03:24,751 --> 00:03:26,876
if your dad lets us
have a Landrover,

36
00:03:26,977 --> 00:03:29,638
we should go further up the river
than we've ever been before.

37
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:32,951
Even up to Taylor's Stitch.
And all the way into Hell.

38
00:03:33,525 --> 00:03:36,854
Hell is on the other side of
Taylor's Stitch. Nobody goes there.

39
00:03:36,955 --> 00:03:39,565
Yes. Why don't you go up the
river again? You always loved that.

40
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,887
Because we wanna go somewhere
we haven't gone before.

41
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,635
Make it a real adventure.
-Why Landrover? Why not the bikes?

42
00:03:44,736 --> 00:03:48,741
Or horses even. Like in an old
fashioned camp out. That'd be fun.

43
00:03:49,377 --> 00:03:51,394
Guys, I'm not ten anymore.

44
00:03:51,495 --> 00:03:55,255
Besides, if there was an emergency,
wouldn't you prefer that I had Landrover?

45
00:03:55,373 --> 00:03:58,494
I don't know, Ellie.
It's a pretty big ask.

46
00:03:58,695 --> 00:04:01,342
Like it or not, dad,
I'm turning 18 this year.

47
00:04:01,443 --> 00:04:05,207
Don't you think it's time
I started showing initiative and...

48
00:04:05,517 --> 00:04:08,894
independence and all those
other good things?

49
00:04:13,262 --> 00:04:15,747
C'mon. It's just a couple of days.

50
00:04:15,848 --> 00:04:18,648
What's the worst
that could possibly happen?

51
00:04:20,734 --> 00:04:23,281
But the show is on this weekend.
-So what?

52
00:04:23,382 --> 00:04:26,813
Do you really care if your mom
wins best decorated cake?

53
00:04:27,447 --> 00:04:29,357
Flip!

54
00:04:29,543 --> 00:04:32,613
<i>I always pictured Kevin in 20 years
being president of the Show Society,</i>

55
00:04:32,714 --> 00:04:35,562
<i>and bringing up his 3 kids.
-Alright.</i>

56
00:04:35,663 --> 00:04:38,318
<i>With Corrie, if she got her way.
-Anything for you.</i>

57
00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:40,704
<i>And she usually did.</i>

58
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,502
Please, tell him he can go to
the bloody show if he wants to.

59
00:04:43,603 --> 00:04:45,803
There's plenty of guys
who'd kill to come with us.

60
00:04:45,903 --> 00:04:49,925
Come on, who else can we ask?
-Somebody fun.

61
00:04:51,244 --> 00:04:52,914
Homer.

62
00:04:55,349 --> 00:04:57,649
I'll see you next weekend, sunshine.

63
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,825
<i>Homer grew up on the farm next to mine.
He was kind of like a brother to me.</i>

64
00:05:02,424 --> 00:05:06,105
<i>He was always getting into trouble.
Both in school and out.</i>

65
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,683
<i>The new police sergeant
arrested him 3 times in one week.</i>

66
00:05:09,884 --> 00:05:13,280
Hey, sarge, how're you going?
Good?

67
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,296
<i>That didn't slow down Homer.</i>

68
00:05:16,397 --> 00:05:19,722
-Alright. -Yeah?
How's the wife, is she good?

69
00:05:20,006 --> 00:05:22,672
<i>I think it was the proud
rebellious greek side of him.</i>

70
00:05:22,773 --> 00:05:26,591
<i>He just didn't care what he did.
Or what anyone thought of him.</i>

71
00:05:39,742 --> 00:05:42,237
How about it?
Are you in or are you out?

72
00:05:42,338 --> 00:05:45,738
Yeah, I'll have a go at that.
Just you girls going?

73
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,448
-Yeah, and Kevin. -It'll be good
for you to have a man around.

74
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:52,149
To do all the hard work for you.

75
00:06:07,428 --> 00:06:10,632
Well, that's four. Anyone else?

76
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:13,960
What about Fiona Maxwell?

77
00:06:14,061 --> 00:06:16,861
Fifi, out in the bush? Seriously?

78
00:06:17,016 --> 00:06:19,612
Oh gosh! You really want me?

79
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:23,222
<i>Fi was the only person I knew
under 60 who said 'gosh'.</i>

80
00:06:23,523 --> 00:06:26,991
Well, no. But our parents said
we had to bring someone along

81
00:06:27,092 --> 00:06:30,719
with a little bit of class.
To balance out all us inbred rurals.

82
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,420
<i>She lived in town,
but we liked her anyway.</i>

83
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,522
Okay. Give me a sec
and I'll ask mom.

84
00:06:37,052 --> 00:06:40,414
Mommy, can I please go camping
with the girls this weekend?

85
00:06:40,515 --> 00:06:43,863
Camping, out in the bush? Seriously?

86
00:06:44,498 --> 00:06:47,323
<i>I'll admit it, Lee was an odd choice.</i>

87
00:06:47,424 --> 00:06:51,241
<i>He was always working in his mom
and dad's restaurant, or of course...</i>

88
00:06:51,397 --> 00:06:53,623
<i>... playing piano.</i>

89
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:59,985
<i>Everyone else thought he was strange.
I just thought he was interesting.</i>

90
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:05,363
May I take your order?
-No, sorry, I don't wanna order anything.

91
00:07:05,664 --> 00:07:08,452
Is this for pick-up or for take-away?

92
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:11,980
No, I would like to speak to
your son Lee. Is he available?

93
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:16,060
You have menu? -No. Yes I do,
but I don't wanna order anything.

94
00:07:16,161 --> 00:07:19,449
What you want?
-I want Lee.

95
00:07:20,425 --> 00:07:23,117
Your son Lee.
I want Lee.

96
00:07:23,586 --> 00:07:27,155
I want Lee.
-This is Lee.

97
00:07:30,586 --> 00:07:33,901
Good evening.
This is Ellie Linton.

98
00:07:34,002 --> 00:07:38,553
I sat next to you in geography
last year. It was on tuesdays.

99
00:07:38,732 --> 00:07:43,965
I have... sort of longish dark hair.
-Yeah, I know who you are, Ellie.

100
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:49,143
Good. Well, some
friends of mine and I are...

101
00:07:49,884 --> 00:07:53,831
We're skipping the show this weekend
and we're going camping instead.

102
00:07:54,032 --> 00:07:57,504
I was... We were wondering if...

103
00:07:57,805 --> 00:08:00,845
maybe... if you wanted to...

104
00:08:01,246 --> 00:08:04,246
... come with us? Or not?

105
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,804
No, that would be awesome.
-Really?

106
00:08:08,105 --> 00:08:11,888
Oh, good. I'll put you down then.

107
00:08:15,457 --> 00:08:19,571
It was actually... -My mom
makes me go help out now.

108
00:08:19,672 --> 00:08:22,699
Can you text me the details?

109
00:08:23,027 --> 00:08:26,292
Yes, I can...
Yes. I'll do that.

110
00:08:26,493 --> 00:08:29,046
Alright. See you.
-B... bye.

111
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:34,471
<i>Lee made it six. But dad said
we had to have eight.</i>

112
00:08:34,572 --> 00:08:38,412
<i>Eventually we compromised on 7,
as long as Robyn was the 7th.</i>

113
00:08:38,613 --> 00:08:42,047
Sorry, Robyn.
If it was just you girls...

114
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,188
... but with boys?
Not without an adult present.

115
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:49,923
<i>Of course, if parents ever had a daughter
they could trust, it was Robyn.</i>

116
00:08:50,024 --> 00:08:53,018
Well, the boys will be
in separate tents, dad.

117
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:57,526
And besides,
this camping trip isn't about...

118
00:08:58,476 --> 00:09:02,751
... romance or anything. It's more
about getting back to nature.

119
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:05,591
You know, we're all kind of...

120
00:09:05,692 --> 00:09:09,892
cooped up in this modern environment,
and I think this camping trip

121
00:09:09,992 --> 00:09:13,701
will help me to help my friends
become closer to God.

122
00:09:13,802 --> 00:09:17,645
Because we need to share
a spiritual connection.

123
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:23,162
If parents were present, I don't think
that I'd be able to reach these girls.

124
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:26,648
And these boys
as much as I would like to.

125
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:05,672
Are you alright, Fi?
You're looking a bit pale.

126
00:10:10,096 --> 00:10:12,961
You look like you're gonna...

127
00:10:15,551 --> 00:10:18,751
It's stuck in the back
of your throat, isn't it?

128
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:22,427
You're trying
to swallow it all down.

129
00:10:22,673 --> 00:10:25,807
But it just keeps coming back up.

130
00:10:35,643 --> 00:10:37,732
Okay, I got it.

131
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:41,587
How much stuff do you need?
-Oh my God Ellie, look at this!

132
00:10:41,688 --> 00:10:44,678
Wait, what is this? Makeup?

133
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:47,632
You never know
who you're going to meet.

134
00:10:47,766 --> 00:10:50,723
Hey, you can see
Cobbler's Bay from here.

135
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,921
You can even see the Heron Bridge.

136
00:10:54,664 --> 00:10:58,713
How far do you reckon we've come?
-That was the easy part.

137
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,743
From here on, we walk.

138
00:11:25,337 --> 00:11:28,850
Ready? On the count of three. One...

139
00:11:30,761 --> 00:11:33,823
Give me a decent throw, sweetheart.

140
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:01,132
Let's go.

141
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:05,454
I meant to do that.

142
00:12:08,641 --> 00:12:12,045
Homer, do you even know
where we're going?

143
00:12:12,503 --> 00:12:15,340
There's a clearing up ahead.

144
00:12:33,743 --> 00:12:36,637
This is very pretty for Hell.

145
00:12:37,398 --> 00:12:40,828
I wonder how long it's been
since anyone's been down here.

146
00:12:40,938 --> 00:12:43,940
I wonder if anyone has
ever been down here, I mean...

147
00:12:44,068 --> 00:12:48,521
why would anyone else've bothered?
-Maybe we're the first ones to see it.

148
00:12:50,547 --> 00:12:54,101
There's no reception. -What were
you expecting, broadband?

149
00:12:54,202 --> 00:12:56,502
Couldn't hurt.

150
00:12:56,699 --> 00:13:00,144
You, what's your name.
Go get some firewood, will you?

151
00:13:00,245 --> 00:13:02,645
It's Lee.

152
00:13:04,391 --> 00:13:07,918
Ellie, what are we having for dinner?

153
00:13:08,219 --> 00:13:11,492
Two-minute noodles.
-Oh, great!

154
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,974
What are they?

155
00:13:16,188 --> 00:13:19,277
You've never heard
of two-minute noodles?

156
00:13:19,478 --> 00:13:22,878
No, my mom is really
into health foods.

157
00:13:24,984 --> 00:13:29,673
It's an awesome feeling to realise you're
about to change someone's life forever.

158
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:41,932
You haven't got 2000 dollars.

159
00:14:15,858 --> 00:14:19,461
Wait a sec, not one guy
asked you out last year?

160
00:14:19,562 --> 00:14:22,162
No. Why would they?

161
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:25,203
Why? You're beautiful, Fi.

162
00:14:25,494 --> 00:14:28,957
My mom is beautiful.
I'm just...

163
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:33,928
You remember, I had braces
for like two years.

164
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:38,340
I still wear glasses and it's not...

165
00:14:40,286 --> 00:14:43,536
She was Miss Wirrawee
three years in a row.

166
00:14:43,637 --> 00:14:47,408
I actually asked her
if I should enter this year,

167
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:50,742
but she didn't think
that was a good idea.

168
00:14:50,643 --> 00:14:54,143
Anyway, I'm doing really well
at school at the moment, so...

169
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,992
... doesn't matter.

170
00:14:57,419 --> 00:15:02,602
And, you know,
a guy will ask me out one day.

171
00:15:04,066 --> 00:15:07,348
I just don't know when. Or who.

172
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,388
Which is exciting.

173
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:16,911
Boys are idiots.
-Fun idiots.

174
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:27,145
You shall not pass.

175
00:16:03,556 --> 00:16:06,245
What's that smell?

176
00:16:06,446 --> 00:16:09,311
-Jet fuel.
-What?

177
00:16:11,469 --> 00:16:14,934
Just a bunch of army planes
going somewhere.

178
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,023
El, what do you think of Fi?

179
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:32,179
I love Fi, you know that.
She seems so perfect.

180
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:35,402
I guess she thinks
I'm a total loser, huh?

181
00:16:35,506 --> 00:16:40,378
I don't think she hates you.
-Yeah, but... you know.

182
00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:45,663
She lives in that big house.
Talks like Mrs Hamilton.

183
00:16:46,822 --> 00:16:51,273
Me and my family... we are just
greek peasants to people like her.

184
00:16:52,593 --> 00:16:55,640
Why don't you ask her out?

185
00:16:56,779 --> 00:16:59,405
I don't know.

186
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:04,454
Girl as pretty as that
must get asked out all the time.

187
00:17:07,308 --> 00:17:10,100
Did anyone else hear
those planes last night?

188
00:17:10,201 --> 00:17:13,801
Yeah. There was six lots of them.
They were flying really low.

189
00:17:13,902 --> 00:17:17,219
No, there were dozens and dozens.
We were counting them, Lee and me.

190
00:17:17,368 --> 00:17:20,992
Lee and I. -But seriously, what do
you think those planes were doing?

191
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,209
Maybe they weren't even ours.

192
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:26,310
It's probably the start of World
War Three and we don't even know.

193
00:17:26,411 --> 00:17:29,197
Alright, who's having rabbit?

194
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,890
Is there any chocolate left?
-Sadly, we're all out.

195
00:17:34,328 --> 00:17:38,504
Oh look, I found some.
-Don't be a dickhead. Give it back!

196
00:17:38,771 --> 00:17:42,588
Thank you. Kevin?
-I was gonna give you some.

197
00:18:29,926 --> 00:18:32,734
So beautiful out here.

198
00:18:33,592 --> 00:18:36,577
I wonder why they call it Hell.

199
00:18:39,249 --> 00:18:44,605
I guess cause it's so wild
and untamed and stuff. Right?

200
00:18:49,206 --> 00:18:51,206
Right.

201
00:18:53,934 --> 00:18:57,862
Wild is difficult.
And it's wonderful and fascinating.

202
00:18:57,963 --> 00:19:03,396
But it's not Hell. People call it that.
People stick labels on things.

203
00:19:03,584 --> 00:19:08,025
Until nobody can see them for who
or what they really are anymore.

204
00:19:10,239 --> 00:19:13,894
Hey, what's going on? -There's
a bloody snake in my sleeping bag.

205
00:19:13,995 --> 00:19:16,997
Are you sure, mate?
I can't see anything.

206
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,882
What kind of snake was it?
-I didn't look.

207
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:25,593
Lot of redbellies out here.
-Are they deadly?

208
00:19:25,728 --> 00:19:29,260
No. Well... if they bite you.

209
00:19:33,367 --> 00:19:35,540
Shake it.

210
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,927
The bag, Beyonce.

211
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:41,884
Don't lift it too high.

212
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,710
I got it, I got it!

213
00:19:58,101 --> 00:20:01,260
I was just about
to do that myself.

214
00:20:01,361 --> 00:20:03,885
Christ, that's a big one!

215
00:20:03,986 --> 00:20:06,596
Are you alright?
-Yeah.

216
00:20:08,773 --> 00:20:10,763
Thanks.

217
00:20:11,757 --> 00:20:15,726
I'm not sleeping in that bag
again. Jesus Christ!

218
00:20:15,927 --> 00:20:19,532
-No need to swear.
-Kevin, no need to bloody swear.

219
00:20:20,328 --> 00:20:23,542
Is it dead?
-Looks dead. Wait...

220
00:20:25,486 --> 00:20:28,301
Nobody's laughing, Homer.

221
00:20:28,502 --> 00:20:32,925
Hey, Fi. Why did you go
into the river?

222
00:20:33,545 --> 00:20:36,021
To get away from
the snake, of course.

223
00:20:36,122 --> 00:20:39,922
You do know that snakes
can swim, right? -No, they can't.

224
00:20:40,023 --> 00:20:42,879
-Yeah they can.
-Snakes can't swim.

225
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:46,864
They don't have fins. They slither.
-They slither through water.

226
00:20:47,065 --> 00:20:50,676
-No, they don't.
-What about sea snakes?

227
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:56,113
Oh my God!

228
00:20:56,471 --> 00:20:59,363
I could've died!

229
00:20:59,664 --> 00:21:01,664
Oh, Fifi!

230
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:05,042
Can I go home now?

231
00:21:07,644 --> 00:21:10,300
Do we have to go back?

232
00:21:10,401 --> 00:21:14,415
Well, I'm excited about
a hot shower. And a pillow.

233
00:21:14,516 --> 00:21:18,116
A pillow would be nice.
Let's do this again.

234
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:21,240
Back here in the same place.
-With the same people.

235
00:21:21,341 --> 00:21:24,041
-If we can find it again.
-We'll find it again.

236
00:21:24,142 --> 00:21:27,076
Let's keep it quiet or
everyone will start coming here

237
00:21:27,177 --> 00:21:30,177
and the place will be
wrecked in no time.

238
00:21:31,199 --> 00:21:34,594
Ladies and gentlemen...
and Homer.

239
00:21:34,936 --> 00:21:37,871
To Hell!
-To Hell.

240
00:21:44,457 --> 00:21:46,897
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

241
00:22:05,709 --> 00:22:08,912
Ellie, what's with your dog?
-Millie!

242
00:22:22,037 --> 00:22:24,643
Mom! Mom?

243
00:22:25,394 --> 00:22:28,390
Dad! Hallo!

244
00:22:31,201 --> 00:22:33,550
Where are you parents?
-I don't know.

245
00:22:33,651 --> 00:22:36,463
-Maybe they left a note.
-Did they say they were going away?

246
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:39,274
-What's the story, El?
-I've no idea. They should be here.

247
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:42,564
-Let's ring my parents.
-No, ring Homer's. They're closer.

248
00:22:44,142 --> 00:22:47,145
There's no dial tone.
-What?

249
00:22:54,191 --> 00:22:56,396
What about TV?

250
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,292
Maybe your grandmother got sick so
they left... -And cut the phone lines?

251
00:23:00,393 --> 00:23:03,957
-Some big electrical problem?
-No, they wouldn't leave Millie to...

252
00:23:04,947 --> 00:23:08,557
Oh, stinks! -Power must be out.
I'll check the generator.

253
00:23:09,194 --> 00:23:11,940
Where's your laptop?

254
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:31,983
-Shit!
-Ellie, let's go to Homer's.

255
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:36,503
-Ellie...
-What?

256
00:23:36,604 --> 00:23:40,645
-Maybe not a good idea.
-Stop the car. Let me out!

257
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:45,446
Mama! Papa!

258
00:23:49,075 --> 00:23:52,227
Wait, where's Lee going? Lee?

259
00:23:54,394 --> 00:23:57,204
What are you doing?

260
00:24:00,513 --> 00:24:04,069
We shouldn't leave it in the open.
-Remember the planes?

261
00:24:04,174 --> 00:24:07,248
We weren't in the open.
Are you serious?

262
00:24:14,229 --> 00:24:16,236
Homer?

263
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:21,175
I already tried that.

264
00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:25,429
Real quiet out there.
-Did you send out a call?

265
00:24:25,663 --> 00:24:28,015
Wouldn't be safe.

266
00:24:28,195 --> 00:24:30,891
No! I know what you're thinking
and it's not possible.

267
00:24:30,992 --> 00:24:33,085
Absolutely, completely impossible.

268
00:24:33,186 --> 00:24:36,086
That kind of stuff just doesn't
happen here. Not in this country.

269
00:24:36,186 --> 00:24:39,229
We gotta be careful.
It could be a lot at stake here.

270
00:24:39,356 --> 00:24:42,543
She's right. We've got to assume
something bad has happened.

271
00:24:42,644 --> 00:24:45,647
Of course something bad
has happened. My dog is dead.

272
00:24:45,748 --> 00:24:48,988
-I didn't mean it like that.
-Shut up! Everyone shut up!

273
00:24:49,089 --> 00:24:52,176
Jesus Christ, what is going on?

274
00:24:55,008 --> 00:24:58,240
Kevin's place was next.
I don't remember who suggested it,

275
00:24:58,343 --> 00:25:01,786
but we decided to
stay off the main roads.

276
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,814
Mom! Dad! Mitchell!

277
00:25:11,997 --> 00:25:13,948
Flip?

278
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:18,000
Flip!

279
00:25:21,724 --> 00:25:26,078
Looks alright. -He always has a bucket
of food and some water. Don't you, boy?

280
00:25:27,965 --> 00:25:30,507
You can't bring that.

281
00:25:30,634 --> 00:25:34,700
You think I'm just gonna leave
him here? I'm not leaving him!

282
00:25:36,229 --> 00:25:38,037
Stop it!

283
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,338
I'm not leaving him!

284
00:25:41,683 --> 00:25:44,257
He's got a point.

285
00:25:48,217 --> 00:25:51,846
Let's take Flip to Corrie's and then
we can make another decision

286
00:25:51,947 --> 00:25:55,447
depending on what we
find there. Agreed?

287
00:25:57,651 --> 00:26:00,484
Flip, let's go.

288
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:10,296
C'mon.

289
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,490
That's four out of four.
The rest of you live in town.

290
00:26:19,591 --> 00:26:23,077
Robyn's house is on Coachman's
Lane. That's probably the closest.

291
00:26:23,178 --> 00:26:26,471
Yeah, you can see most of Wirrawee
from the hill at the back.

292
00:26:26,592 --> 00:26:30,009
It might tell us something.
-Then we go to Robyn's next.

293
00:26:51,688 --> 00:26:54,492
Flip, sit. Stay.

294
00:26:57,615 --> 00:27:01,700
Please don't touch that.
-Let's go up that hill.

295
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:13,692
Something's going on
at the Showground.

296
00:27:13,794 --> 00:27:16,993
I think that's where everyone is.
-What about those other lights?

297
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:19,776
Hospital. Must be using
the emergency generators.

298
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:21,917
Maybe we should split up.

299
00:27:22,018 --> 00:27:24,346
Split up? No, we can't.
We have to stay together.

300
00:27:24,447 --> 00:27:28,137
We need to be out of town
before dawn. Just in case.

301
00:27:29,609 --> 00:27:33,670
I'll take Fi to her house.
Lee, you take Robyn to yours.

302
00:27:33,871 --> 00:27:36,921
We'll meet back here at 5 a.m.

303
00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:39,983
So we just stay here?

304
00:27:43,657 --> 00:27:46,685
You get to go to the Show.

305
00:28:02,985 --> 00:28:06,084
Whose voices are those?
-I don't know.

306
00:28:07,765 --> 00:28:10,809
I think we should go back.
-No. Wait.

307
00:28:12,283 --> 00:28:14,944
We have to get a better
look before we leave.

308
00:28:15,045 --> 00:28:17,045
Better look at what, Ellie?
Let's go!

309
00:28:17,145 --> 00:28:20,971
One of us has to get closer before
we go. We gotta see what's going on.

310
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:24,170
I'm not leaving Corrie here.

311
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:30,201
-I'll go.
-Ellie!

312
00:28:32,426 --> 00:28:35,682
If anything happens, run.

313
00:29:35,688 --> 00:29:39,314
<i>Do not try to escape
or you will be shot.</i>

314
00:30:04,352 --> 00:30:06,282
Dad!

315
00:30:06,818 --> 00:30:10,739
This is bloody ridiculous. I've been
waiting in this stupid line for 2 hours!

316
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,786
Who do you people think you are?

317
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,593
Hands off me.

318
00:31:11,199 --> 00:31:13,620
Are you okay?

319
00:31:14,343 --> 00:31:16,782
Where's Kevin?

320
00:31:19,617 --> 00:31:22,464
Quick! They're coming!

321
00:31:24,183 --> 00:31:26,609
Ellie... -What?
-Can we stop?

322
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:29,742
Corrie, c'mon! Please! Please.

323
00:31:31,032 --> 00:31:33,006
Come on.

324
00:31:33,865 --> 00:31:36,958
Where are they now?
-I don't know. -Guys!

325
00:31:37,059 --> 00:31:39,859
Kevin! Oh my God!
What happened to you?

326
00:31:40,012 --> 00:31:44,231
I thought that you're ahead of me,
so I just... I just ran.

327
00:31:45,562 --> 00:31:48,808
Ellie said that if anything
was to happen to run.

328
00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:54,809
-Oh my God!
-Go!

329
00:32:03,527 --> 00:32:05,721
C'mon, c'mon...

330
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:08,800
Let's go.

331
00:32:10,047 --> 00:32:13,102
-I hurt my knee.
-C'mon, we gotta keep moving.

332
00:32:16,046 --> 00:32:19,061
Are you alright?
-No. I cut it. Jesus!

333
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:28,179
Give me your shirt. Quick.

334
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:32,685
Singlet, it's better. Quick.
Get me a stick or something.

335
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:37,070
Stay here.

336
00:32:44,859 --> 00:32:47,248
Ellie, hurry up!

337
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:53,170
Quick, get back!

338
00:32:56,271 --> 00:32:59,225
-Will this do?
-Yeah, quick.

339
00:33:00,452 --> 00:33:03,424
Ellie, they are coming.
-Alright.

340
00:33:06,185 --> 00:33:08,206
Light it.

341
00:33:10,975 --> 00:33:13,029
Light it.

342
00:33:30,338 --> 00:33:34,906
Corrie, we gotta get out of here.
Get up, c'mon. Ellie, let's go!

343
00:33:40,802 --> 00:33:42,911
Hang up.

344
00:33:47,123 --> 00:33:50,027
<i>She wasn't much older than I was.</i>

345
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:53,316
<i>And she looked just as scared.</i>

346
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:06,892
<i>I'll never forget her.</i>

347
00:34:06,993 --> 00:34:10,005
Ellie, we don't have time.
-Come on!

348
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,763
Thank God!
We heard an explosion.

349
00:34:16,864 --> 00:34:20,122
-Yeah, that was us.
-Are you alright? -Yeah.

350
00:34:21,161 --> 00:34:24,204
Flip! There he is. Good boy!

351
00:34:24,705 --> 00:34:27,905
Where did all those
soldiers come from?

352
00:34:31,634 --> 00:34:34,558
Where did you get this thing?

353
00:34:38,627 --> 00:34:41,516
Wait, where's Robyn and Lee?

354
00:34:43,321 --> 00:34:46,266
They haven't come back yet.
-It's almost 6 a.m.

355
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:49,068
We were just about
to give up on all of you.

356
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:52,132
We have to go and find them
then, don't we? -Ellie...

357
00:34:52,253 --> 00:34:55,296
Homer, we have to go find them.
-It's daylight now.

358
00:34:55,414 --> 00:34:58,114
-I'm not leaving them.
-We're not leaving them.

359
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,501
We'll come back tonight
when it's safer.

360
00:35:00,602 --> 00:35:03,720
Yeah cause there'll be soldiers
crawling all over town by now.

361
00:35:03,821 --> 00:35:06,682
I mean... after what you did.

362
00:35:08,276 --> 00:35:12,258
We will find them.
Ellie, I promise.

363
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:37,068
El... El... come on.

364
00:35:45,112 --> 00:35:47,874
-Wait, just...
-No, don't touch me.

365
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:00,366
Sit down over there.
-Are you alright?

366
00:36:00,622 --> 00:36:03,675
I'll get us some food.
-Thank you.

367
00:36:06,596 --> 00:36:09,845
So, any idea whose army it is?
-We didn't exactly stop to ask.

368
00:36:09,946 --> 00:36:12,960
We'll ask Robyn. She's good
with flags and things like that.

369
00:36:13,061 --> 00:36:15,826
All I can say is they are not greek.
-It doesn't matter who they are,

370
00:36:15,927 --> 00:36:18,104
because they're here.
We just got to deal with it.

371
00:36:18,205 --> 00:36:19,748
Alright, mate. Calm down.

372
00:36:19,849 --> 00:36:23,249
No, seriously, what difference
does a flag make?

373
00:36:51,526 --> 00:36:54,393
Fi made this for you.

374
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:02,597
Her house is empty too?
-Yeah.

375
00:37:03,442 --> 00:37:05,862
There are soldiers everywhere.

376
00:37:06,068 --> 00:37:08,863
We crawled all the way
back to Robyn's.

377
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:12,241
Not bad for a first date.

378
00:37:22,565 --> 00:37:25,576
The others told me what happened.

379
00:37:26,887 --> 00:37:28,688
El.

380
00:37:29,598 --> 00:37:32,083
It's not your fault.

381
00:37:32,376 --> 00:37:35,955
It's not your fault.
It's theirs.

382
00:37:37,234 --> 00:37:40,303
It's all theirs.

383
00:37:42,024 --> 00:37:44,837
You're changing.
-Yeah?

384
00:37:46,588 --> 00:37:51,136
-For better or worse?
-Better. Definitely better.

385
00:38:30,528 --> 00:38:32,827
Looks good.

386
00:38:33,275 --> 00:38:36,332
Fi'd always say
she'd be a doctor.

387
00:38:45,741 --> 00:38:49,365
You're gonna have to forgive him
sooner or later, you know.

388
00:38:49,857 --> 00:38:52,679
He just left us, Ellie.

389
00:38:53,723 --> 00:38:56,594
He just ran and left us.

390
00:38:58,039 --> 00:39:00,926
I thought he loved me.

391
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:05,762
Do you remember how many
hours we used to spend up here?

392
00:39:06,027 --> 00:39:08,883
You mean the tea parties?

393
00:39:09,984 --> 00:39:13,579
We were so innocent
back then. And now I...

394
00:39:14,404 --> 00:39:17,863
I feel like we were innocent
right up until yesterday.

395
00:39:18,345 --> 00:39:21,637
We didn't believe in Santa Claus
or anything like that.

396
00:39:21,747 --> 00:39:24,918
You know, we believed
in other fantasies.

397
00:39:25,553 --> 00:39:28,536
We believed we were safe.

398
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:34,853
I guess that was the biggest
fantasy of them all, right?

399
00:39:36,437 --> 00:39:40,147
Do you ever think we'll see
Robyn and Lee again?

400
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:52,330
That's one of ours!

401
00:40:14,456 --> 00:40:17,297
How many planes do we have?

402
00:40:17,564 --> 00:40:20,097
One less now.

403
00:40:20,961 --> 00:40:22,842
How's this?

404
00:40:22,943 --> 00:40:25,865
I'm going to Wirrawee with Ellie
and we look for Robyn and Lee.

405
00:40:25,966 --> 00:40:28,808
You three go back to my place
and load up the Landrover.

406
00:40:28,909 --> 00:40:31,264
Seems a hell of a risk
going back into Wirrawee.

407
00:40:31,365 --> 00:40:34,413
What if it was you
they're going back for?

408
00:40:34,795 --> 00:40:37,172
Don't ask me to go with you.
-He's not.

409
00:40:37,273 --> 00:40:39,373
Good, because
I'm not bloody going.

410
00:40:39,473 --> 00:40:42,229
Jesus, Kevin. Everything is
a risk from now on.

411
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:47,186
We can't sit around here forever.
The biggest risk is to take no risk.

412
00:40:48,093 --> 00:40:52,732
Alright. But if we can't stay here
where do you want us all to go?

413
00:40:54,895 --> 00:40:56,823
Hell.

414
00:40:57,124 --> 00:41:00,320
We're not taking your teddies.
-Not all of them, just one.

415
00:41:00,421 --> 00:41:03,306
We can't take things like that.
-Why can't we?

416
00:41:03,407 --> 00:41:06,850
This isn't a picnic, El. We have
to start acting like soldiers.

417
00:41:07,251 --> 00:41:10,724
One mistake and... it's all over.

418
00:41:13,015 --> 00:41:16,771
Can we take my mom's crowns and sashes?
-Yeah, and photos. Don't forget photos.

419
00:41:16,872 --> 00:41:19,386
Geez, we're gonna need
a trailer pretty soon.

420
00:41:19,487 --> 00:41:22,887
Look, if you can take teddies,
crowns and photos,

421
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:26,767
I might aswell take my dad's
bloody football trophies.

422
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:35,475
Oh, and dog food for Flip.
Lots of dog food. Write that down.

423
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:38,227
-He can eat rabbit.
-What about wire cutters?

424
00:41:38,328 --> 00:41:41,001
Now that's a great idea.

425
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:45,171
Two T's.

426
00:41:58,147 --> 00:42:00,687
What about guns?
-We'll take our own guns.

427
00:42:00,788 --> 00:42:03,556
Just turn it off.
-No, I can fix this. Hang on.

428
00:42:06,807 --> 00:42:09,335
The pipe's burst again.

429
00:42:13,624 --> 00:42:16,258
So, we've got plenty of
ammo for the rifles,

430
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:18,759
and a full magazine for that.

431
00:42:19,002 --> 00:42:21,245
I got it!

432
00:42:25,516 --> 00:42:27,845
What's that?

433
00:42:31,304 --> 00:42:34,052
We forgot to have someone on watch.

434
00:42:34,348 --> 00:42:37,124
Don't touch the curtains.

435
00:42:38,615 --> 00:42:41,302
Spread out!
Go into different rooms.

436
00:42:41,403 --> 00:42:44,990
If you see anything, yell out.
But stay hidden.

437
00:42:49,044 --> 00:42:50,684
Flip!

438
00:42:50,978 --> 00:42:53,419
Flip, get inside!

439
00:43:02,755 --> 00:43:05,355
It's here!

440
00:43:05,956 --> 00:43:08,975
Did they see you?
-I don't know.

441
00:43:39,341 --> 00:43:41,380
Homer!

442
00:43:46,267 --> 00:43:48,289
Ellie!

443
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:51,060
Stay still!

444
00:44:19,222 --> 00:44:22,104
Good thing you're so skinny.

445
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,771
Hey guys, I think it's coming back.

446
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:46,523
Flairs. They're marking the house.

447
00:44:49,024 --> 00:44:52,024
-Thanks a lot, Homer.
-No one asked your opinion, mate.

448
00:44:52,125 --> 00:44:55,125
They know we're here now. -Of course they
know. They saw us through the window.

449
00:44:55,227 --> 00:44:58,227
But they didn't know we had guns!

450
00:45:01,426 --> 00:45:05,026
Let's get out of here.
C'mon, let's get out of here, now!

451
00:45:05,227 --> 00:45:07,227
Go, go, go...

452
00:45:08,227 --> 00:45:10,827
Go, go, move it!

453
00:45:13,028 --> 00:45:14,828
Run!

454
00:45:15,428 --> 00:45:17,228
Run!
-Flip!

455
00:45:17,329 --> 00:45:19,729
Leave him!
-No!

456
00:46:08,033 --> 00:46:10,398
<i>Homer was right.</i>

457
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:14,652
<i>Hell was the only
safe place for us now.</i>

458
00:46:14,753 --> 00:46:17,577
<i>But first we had to find
Robyn and Lee.</i>

459
00:46:19,571 --> 00:46:22,704
What's wrong?
-The Heron Bridge!

460
00:46:32,596 --> 00:46:35,480
Jesus, look at them all.

461
00:46:35,723 --> 00:46:38,772
They are coming up from
Cobbler's Bay.

462
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:42,298
I bet you this is one of
the first places they captured.

463
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:45,000
It's probably
full of ships right now.

464
00:46:45,101 --> 00:46:48,285
Yeah. And our bridge
gives them direct access to it.

465
00:46:49,318 --> 00:46:52,186
I've always hated that bridge.

466
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:56,324
Come on, we have to
get to Robyn's house.

467
00:47:20,299 --> 00:47:22,146
Robyn!

468
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:24,758
Ellie?

469
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:36,272
How did you know it was her?
-That's her dad's walking stick.

470
00:47:36,627 --> 00:47:39,834
What was she gonna do,
beat us with it?

471
00:47:44,311 --> 00:47:46,516
Ellie, thank God!

472
00:47:46,617 --> 00:47:49,617
-Are you hurt?
-No, no, I'm fine.

473
00:47:49,822 --> 00:47:52,307
Where is Lee?

474
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:56,060
He's been shot.

475
00:48:11,712 --> 00:48:14,270
Wait here a minute.

476
00:48:15,286 --> 00:48:18,127
Someone should go with her.

477
00:48:31,086 --> 00:48:33,834
All clear. Let's go.

478
00:48:37,334 --> 00:48:40,524
Robyn. Go, go, go...

479
00:49:17,613 --> 00:49:20,430
Don't point that thing at me.
-This is dr Clement.

480
00:49:20,531 --> 00:49:23,128
It's okay, he's my dentist.
He works across the street.

481
00:49:23,229 --> 00:49:26,275
-Dr Clement, it's me. It's Robyn.
-Quiet down, the lot of you.

482
00:49:26,376 --> 00:49:28,776
Don't you know there's
a bloody war going on?

483
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,345
Shine that here.

484
00:49:33,414 --> 00:49:37,501
How is it? -He was lucky.
The bullet went right through.

485
00:49:37,941 --> 00:49:41,380
Thank you. -You picked the hell
of a weekend to go camping.

486
00:49:41,512 --> 00:49:44,111
We heard the planes,
but we didn't see any...

487
00:49:44,257 --> 00:49:47,896
That's how they did it.
Freighter planes and container ships.

488
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,656
Took all the ports and runways
in the first 24 hours.

489
00:49:51,865 --> 00:49:55,046
News said there was some
kind of explosion at the airfield.

490
00:49:55,147 --> 00:49:57,998
None of us paid much attention to it.
Next thing you know,

491
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:01,003
they are rolling across the bridge
in their tanks and trucks,

492
00:50:01,104 --> 00:50:03,977
rounding up everyone, taking
them all to the Showground.

493
00:50:04,078 --> 00:50:07,409
Lee's whole family.
Yours too.

494
00:50:07,781 --> 00:50:10,994
And mine? -Yours I don't
know anything about.

495
00:50:11,474 --> 00:50:14,167
What about my parents?
George and Martha Yannos.

496
00:50:14,268 --> 00:50:16,270
Did they ever get
their teeth fixed? -No.

497
00:50:16,371 --> 00:50:19,020
Then how the hell would I know who
they are? -I was just asking, doc.

498
00:50:19,124 --> 00:50:21,358
I've been hiding in the closet
for three straight days,

499
00:50:21,459 --> 00:50:24,959
living in my own piss and shit, just
waiting for them to come and find me.

500
00:50:25,106 --> 00:50:28,398
I thought I'll finally snap when
I saw you carrying Lee in here.

501
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:31,547
-You carried him?
-Yeah, I had to.

502
00:50:31,857 --> 00:50:34,705
If his leg starts to hurt,
you gotta give him another shot.

503
00:50:34,806 --> 00:50:37,390
Wait, you're not staying with us?

504
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,642
Look, I took a hell of a risk
coming down here for Lee, alright?

505
00:50:40,743 --> 00:50:43,775
I've done enough.
I've gotta go.

506
00:50:45,697 --> 00:50:49,781
Wait, dr Clement. Are there
any others out there? Like us?

507
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:53,838
Oh, yeah. I've seen few people
try to do some things.

508
00:50:53,958 --> 00:50:56,349
Try to be heroes.

509
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:59,150
Apparently one group even
tried to blow up Heron bridge.

510
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:02,887
To stop all those bloody convoys
coming up from Cobbler's Bay.

511
00:51:02,988 --> 00:51:05,928
They all paid the price.

512
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:01,801
Are you okay?

513
00:52:04,181 --> 00:52:07,171
I think we should get a vehicle.
-We always had two.

514
00:52:07,272 --> 00:52:10,468
First one you dump somewhere.
Second one is a getaway car.

515
00:52:10,569 --> 00:52:14,855
-So, you had practice at this?
-Great. I'll just go get mom's car,

516
00:52:14,956 --> 00:52:19,036
park it at the front and ask soldiers
to look the other way, shall I?

517
00:52:24,405 --> 00:52:27,316
Sorry. I'm just... tired.

518
00:52:27,559 --> 00:52:30,510
How about if we get
something silent?

519
00:52:30,611 --> 00:52:33,611
Golf carts, shopping trollies...
-Prams, pushers...

520
00:52:33,855 --> 00:52:36,869
Wheelchairs? -Yeah, could you
ride in a wheelchair?

521
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:41,040
I could, but the more I move
the more it hurts. -Wait...

522
00:52:42,485 --> 00:52:45,026
What if we're going about this
the wrong way?

523
00:52:45,127 --> 00:52:47,127
What do you mean?

524
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:50,746
We're thinking of quiet
sneaky little things, right?

525
00:52:53,917 --> 00:52:56,497
What if we went
to the other extreme?

526
00:52:56,598 --> 00:53:00,809
Rock up in something so indestructible
that it wouldn't matter who saw us.

527
00:53:02,273 --> 00:53:04,645
Such as?

528
00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:29,313
Shit!

529
00:53:29,914 --> 00:53:31,914
Let's go!

530
00:53:32,573 --> 00:53:35,076
Are you alright?
-Hang on. -What?

531
00:53:35,177 --> 00:53:38,019
-I can't climb up there.
-Get in the bucket.

532
00:53:38,233 --> 00:53:40,639
-In this?
-Yeah.

533
00:53:45,612 --> 00:53:47,823
I thought you said
you could drive this thing.

534
00:53:47,924 --> 00:53:50,924
I said I can drive a tractor.
Get in.

535
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:57,140
Oh shit.

536
00:53:59,038 --> 00:54:01,722
Drive, Ellie. Drive!

537
00:54:09,154 --> 00:54:12,318
Take this, shoot back at them!
-No, I won't do it.

538
00:54:12,419 --> 00:54:15,657
This is no time to get religious.
-I said no!

539
00:54:21,398 --> 00:54:24,066
You're bleeding!

540
00:54:31,867 --> 00:54:33,667
Go!

541
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:46,596
I hope Homer's got a getaway car.
-I hope he remembers where to meet us.

542
00:54:46,697 --> 00:54:50,297
Even Homer knows how to
find a bloody church. -Ellie!

543
00:54:55,497 --> 00:54:58,068
Start praying again.

544
00:55:20,425 --> 00:55:23,825
Lord, forgive us our sins...

545
00:55:30,426 --> 00:55:32,449
Hold on!

546
00:55:48,683 --> 00:55:51,513
I think we lost one of them.

547
00:55:57,146 --> 00:55:59,546
We lost a tire!

548
00:56:09,922 --> 00:56:13,711
You're driving in circles!
-I'm doing the best I can!

549
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:36,434
You are dangerous. -That's what
my driving instructor said.

550
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:46,044
He's still chasing us!

551
00:56:56,497 --> 00:57:00,216
How do you dump the rubbish?
-That switch, I think.

552
00:57:23,542 --> 00:57:27,112
Who is dangerous now?
-Do you think any of them got hurt?

553
00:57:27,257 --> 00:57:30,515
Don't worry.
God will understand.

554
00:57:49,769 --> 00:57:52,032
Where's Homer?

555
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:55,076
He's supposed to be here.
Where is he?

556
00:57:55,269 --> 00:57:57,985
Maybe he got caught.

557
00:57:59,304 --> 00:58:01,326
We have to keep going,
get out of town.

558
00:58:01,427 --> 00:58:03,327
No. Ellie, we've got
to wait for Homer.

559
00:58:03,428 --> 00:58:06,029
How long do you think it's gonna be
before they send another vehicle?

560
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:09,130
Or even a helicopter?
We have to leave now!

561
00:58:12,124 --> 00:58:15,875
Sorry I'm late. I forgot
where the bloody church was.

562
00:59:54,136 --> 00:59:57,076
Why are we stopping?
-I have to rest.

563
00:59:57,277 --> 01:00:00,143
Move over, I'll drive.
-No, dad said only I...

564
01:00:00,344 --> 01:00:02,744
Just don't, okay?

565
01:00:04,422 --> 01:00:06,689
This is Chris Lang's house.

566
01:00:06,790 --> 01:00:09,790
Oh, that guy is such a weirdo.
-He's a genius, Kevin.

567
01:00:09,890 --> 01:00:12,644
-He's a bloody stoner.
-Stoners are people too.

568
01:00:12,745 --> 01:00:16,089
I don't really care as long as
there's a soft bed in there.

569
01:00:16,239 --> 01:00:19,774
And maybe a toothbrush.
-I've got a spare toothbrush.

570
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:25,739
<i>Chris says his father was born on
the corner of Straight and Narrow.</i>

571
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:28,600
<i>And that he was born
in the other end of town.</i>

572
01:00:28,701 --> 01:00:32,571
The day before it all began,
mom and dad left for Saudi Arabia.

573
01:00:32,866 --> 01:00:35,745
So, here I am. Alone.

574
01:00:36,025 --> 01:00:39,027
And the power
goes off at like nine...

575
01:00:39,328 --> 01:00:42,028
... or ten. Nine.

576
01:00:42,529 --> 01:00:45,729
Yeah, nine.
So I think, okay.

577
01:00:46,928 --> 01:00:50,172
I better ring up and
find out what's going on.

578
01:00:51,542 --> 01:00:54,789
I'm an idiot.
The phones are down too.

579
01:00:55,077 --> 01:01:00,281
So, I'm so bent by this point.
Like, I'm really stoned. I'm baked.

580
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:04,277
Anyway, I walk down to the car...

581
01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:06,950
... and dad, get this right,

582
01:01:07,151 --> 01:01:11,540
dad has locked the car
and taken the keys with him.

583
01:01:14,135 --> 01:01:17,220
I think he's such a wanker
for doing that.

584
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:21,421
You know, like he didn't even
trust me with a car for one week.

585
01:01:21,889 --> 01:01:25,542
So now, I have to walk
to the Ramseys' place.

586
01:01:25,743 --> 01:01:29,400
And it is far. Like,
take what you think is far,

587
01:01:29,601 --> 01:01:33,001
time it by like 10, say.

588
01:01:34,501 --> 01:01:38,315
And that's how far it was.
And when I get there...

589
01:01:38,708 --> 01:01:43,268
... nobody is at home.
And it's like... oh, great!

590
01:01:44,098 --> 01:01:47,283
Because the next place
is even further.

591
01:01:47,489 --> 01:01:50,227
Anyway, I walk around the corner.

592
01:01:50,491 --> 01:01:54,060
And I can see the Ramseys
in their truck.

593
01:01:56,585 --> 01:01:59,310
They'd hit a tree.

594
01:01:59,611 --> 01:02:03,111
But that's not
what has killed them.

595
01:02:04,647 --> 01:02:07,510
They've been shot.

596
01:02:08,724 --> 01:02:11,255
They've been shot?!

597
01:02:11,522 --> 01:02:15,992
Like no one gets shot.
And I mean, heaps of times.

598
01:02:19,324 --> 01:02:24,012
Mr Ramsey, Mrs Ramsey,
even baby Jessica's been shot.

599
01:02:28,709 --> 01:02:31,717
So, I think to myself...

600
01:02:32,948 --> 01:02:36,401
Either I've been smoking
some really weird shit,

601
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:40,022
or this isn't your
typical day in Wirrawee.

602
01:02:46,519 --> 01:02:50,992
Anyway, I've just been
by myself ever since, really.

603
01:02:52,331 --> 01:02:56,590
Just chilling out.
It's been nice.

604
01:03:00,466 --> 01:03:02,591
Nice.

605
01:03:14,421 --> 01:03:17,165
How funny are dogs?

606
01:03:22,445 --> 01:03:25,170
How does it feel to get shot?

607
01:03:25,345 --> 01:03:28,949
I didn't even feel it at first.
But by the time I got back

608
01:03:29,073 --> 01:03:32,582
to the restaurant, it felt
like my whole leg was on fire.

609
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:36,141
Like somebody was pulling
a barbed wire throught it.

610
01:03:36,418 --> 01:03:39,221
They wrecked your restaurant?

611
01:03:39,498 --> 01:03:41,301
Yeah.

612
01:03:41,625 --> 01:03:44,285
I used to hate that place.

613
01:03:44,601 --> 01:03:48,989
Working there, being there.
Just living there.

614
01:03:50,184 --> 01:03:53,330
I felt like I was
in prison or something.

615
01:03:53,531 --> 01:03:57,164
But you know, I helped
make that place what it was.

616
01:03:57,685 --> 01:04:00,566
So when someone smashes a window,

617
01:04:00,667 --> 01:04:04,467
they are smashing glass that
I hand-polished a thousand times.

618
01:04:04,726 --> 01:04:08,978
Or they are tearing curtains
that my mom and I hand-stitched.

619
01:04:10,247 --> 01:04:13,832
You get a certain type
of attachment to the place.

620
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:18,966
It's weird. Takes on
its own kind of beauty.

621
01:04:35,390 --> 01:04:39,402
You know, I always used to
look forward to geography.

622
01:04:58,804 --> 01:05:03,011
I should go back and
check on Chris. -Chris?

623
01:05:03,479 --> 01:05:06,227
Yeah, I left him on watch.

624
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,328
Sorry.

625
01:05:21,979 --> 01:05:24,121
Chris.

626
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:28,322
Chris? Hey!

627
01:05:40,785 --> 01:05:43,795
Get up. Get up!

628
01:05:44,206 --> 01:05:47,792
Are you awake now, you little shit?
-Geez Ellie, take it easy.

629
01:05:48,118 --> 01:05:50,936
-Take it easy? -Yeah, I just
shut my eyes for a second.

630
01:05:51,037 --> 01:05:53,812
Don't you understand how it's all
changed, Chris? Don't you get it?

631
01:05:53,813 --> 01:05:57,013
-Yeah, I do. I do get it.
-If we take it easy any more...

632
01:05:57,163 --> 01:06:00,036
We might aswell shoot each other
now and get it over with.

633
01:06:00,137 --> 01:06:02,160
Okay I get it. I do.

634
01:06:02,261 --> 01:06:05,061
I'm sorry.
I'm really really sorry.

635
01:06:05,581 --> 01:06:08,352
Must be that time of the month.

636
01:06:10,677 --> 01:06:13,096
Shoot me. -What are you doing?
-Go on Chris, shoot me!

637
01:06:13,197 --> 01:06:15,597
-I don't wanna shoot you.
-You can't kill me while I'm awake?

638
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:18,698
-Geez Ellie, it was an accident.
I'm sorry. -Bullshit you're sorry!

639
01:06:18,831 --> 01:06:22,648
People are dying out there, Chris.
Families have been split apart.

640
01:06:22,832 --> 01:06:25,513
We've seen homes
blown to pieces.

641
01:06:25,724 --> 01:06:28,613
Yet you're up here
having a fuckin vacation.

642
01:06:28,813 --> 01:06:31,629
So, go on. Don't wait
for me to fall asleep.

643
01:06:31,852 --> 01:06:35,229
Buck up, be a man, look me
in the eye and pull the trigger.

644
01:06:35,430 --> 01:06:39,199
Ellie, please... -No?
-What are you doing?

645
01:06:39,558 --> 01:06:42,594
Do you know what penalty is
for falling asleep at your post?

646
01:06:42,695 --> 01:06:45,897
Do you know what they
used to do? -No, Ellie...

647
01:06:47,223 --> 01:06:48,923
Ellie!

648
01:06:49,024 --> 01:06:52,674
Put the gun down, please.
I said I'm sorry. Please!

649
01:06:53,324 --> 01:06:56,124
He risked all our lives.

650
01:06:56,493 --> 01:06:58,286
Ellie.

651
01:06:59,246 --> 01:07:01,645
It's Chris.

652
01:07:02,147 --> 01:07:04,847
It's just Chris.

653
01:08:13,763 --> 01:08:16,731
How long have I been asleep?

654
01:08:18,101 --> 01:08:21,516
About 16 hours.

655
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:39,414
How's Chris?

656
01:08:39,787 --> 01:08:42,672
Still pretty shaken.

657
01:08:43,519 --> 01:08:46,639
You gave him a hell of a fright,
you know.

658
01:08:51,490 --> 01:08:54,319
I'll apologize when he wakes up.

659
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:57,735
I promise.

660
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:02,341
Actually, he wants
to apologize to you.

661
01:09:03,926 --> 01:09:06,186
You were right, El.

662
01:09:06,450 --> 01:09:10,204
You went a little overboard
about it, but you were right.

663
01:09:31,105 --> 01:09:33,962
You're a good mate, Corrie.

664
01:09:34,696 --> 01:09:37,619
And you're a bloody nutcase.

665
01:09:49,822 --> 01:09:53,439
-Good book?
-Better than the movie.

666
01:09:54,996 --> 01:09:59,282
Yeah, books usually are.

667
01:09:59,392 --> 01:10:03,132
<i>The general repeated his claim
that the Coalition nations</i>

668
01:10:03,233 --> 01:10:06,137
<i>can no longer support
their booming populations.</i>

669
01:10:06,238 --> 01:10:09,420
<i>And that Australia must be
made to share her vast land</i>

670
01:10:09,521 --> 01:10:13,593
<i>and extensive natural resources
with her less fortunate neighbors.</i>

671
01:10:13,894 --> 01:10:17,158
<i>In this way, general hopes
the invasion will balance</i>

672
01:10:17,259 --> 01:10:19,918
<i>the economic scales
within the region</i>

673
01:10:20,019 --> 01:10:23,419
<i>and eventually lead to a new era
of peace and stability.</i>

674
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:26,852
<i>Meanwhile, more than
half a million Coalition forces</i>

675
01:10:26,953 --> 01:10:30,353
<i>are pouring into Australia
though three captured ports.</i>

676
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:33,801
<i>These ports have now being
identified as Townsville,</i>

677
01:10:33,902 --> 01:10:36,902
<i>Port Headland and Cobbler's Bay.</i>

678
01:10:37,764 --> 01:10:41,173
-You heal well.
-I have good genes.

679
01:10:46,642 --> 01:10:49,564
There's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

680
01:10:49,665 --> 01:10:52,466
You know at Chris' house
the other day when I was...

681
01:10:52,567 --> 01:10:55,429
playing with your hair and then...
-Yeah, all right.

682
01:10:55,565 --> 01:10:58,639
I know what we did. -Okay,
I thought you might have forgotten.

683
01:10:58,740 --> 01:11:02,217
What, do you think I do that stuff
so often that I forget about it?

684
01:11:02,847 --> 01:11:05,504
But you've hardly
spoken to me since then.

685
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:09,358
-I'm just confused.
-About me?

686
01:11:09,517 --> 01:11:13,336
Yeah, about you, about us.
About this war.

687
01:11:14,542 --> 01:11:17,367
About this mess that
we found ourselves in.

688
01:11:17,568 --> 01:11:21,020
The truth is, half the time
I have no idea what I'm doing.

689
01:11:21,121 --> 01:11:24,514
So then, I do these things,
and they don't always mean

690
01:11:24,615 --> 01:11:28,011
what I think they mean.
Do you know what I mean?

691
01:11:28,212 --> 01:11:31,812
No, I've no idea what you mean.
-Okay...

692
01:11:32,637 --> 01:11:36,262
Look, it meant something then
and it does mean something now,

693
01:11:36,362 --> 01:11:39,889
but... I don't think it means
what you'd wanted it to mean.

694
01:11:39,990 --> 01:11:43,185
-Do you just not like me?
-No, Lee. I like you, okay?

695
01:11:43,386 --> 01:11:47,180
I like you very much. But right now,
you're driving me crazy.

696
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:53,554
<i>I don't know why
I was talking the way I was.</i>

697
01:11:53,836 --> 01:11:56,574
<i>All I really wanted to do is hold him</i>

698
01:11:56,675 --> 01:11:59,675
<i>and tell him that everything
is gonna be alright.</i>

699
01:12:00,088 --> 01:12:02,823
<i>I just didn't know if it was.</i>

700
01:12:03,190 --> 01:12:05,540
<i>None of us did.</i>

701
01:12:05,710 --> 01:12:09,942
<i>All we could say for sure was
that for now, we were free.</i>

702
01:12:10,732 --> 01:12:14,319
<i>But we've done nothing
to earn our freedom.</i>

703
01:12:16,940 --> 01:12:19,630
<i>Not yet, anyway.</i>

704
01:12:50,418 --> 01:12:53,957
The way I see it,
these are our choices.

705
01:12:54,351 --> 01:12:57,526
One: we can sit here
and do nothing.

706
01:12:57,827 --> 01:13:01,408
Come out when the war's over.
I don't know about you guys...

707
01:13:01,809 --> 01:13:04,378
but I'm not so good
at doing nothing.

708
01:13:04,477 --> 01:13:07,247
Two: we can all try to be heroes.

709
01:13:07,348 --> 01:13:09,693
Rescue our families
from the Showground's.

710
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:13,298
But like dr Helpfull said,
we'll probably pay the price.

711
01:13:13,655 --> 01:13:19,842
Or three: we can go out there,
at night. Guerilla style.

712
01:13:20,043 --> 01:13:23,843
Using hit and run tactics
and take back Wirrawee.

713
01:13:25,726 --> 01:13:28,674
Maybe even help win this thing.
-Yeah, you're right.

714
01:13:28,775 --> 01:13:31,240
We were born here. We know
this country better than they do.

715
01:13:31,341 --> 01:13:34,441
We can use that to our advantage.
Plant traps, ambush them, pick them off.

716
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:37,834
-You're talking about murder.
-It's not murder if it's in a war.

717
01:13:37,956 --> 01:13:40,767
What about the Bible, "thou shall
not kill". What about that?

718
01:13:40,868 --> 01:13:44,252
David killed Goliath. -That doesn't
apply in a situation that is a metaphor.

719
01:13:44,354 --> 01:13:47,046
Do you think it's fair, do you?
-No. -Just let them walk in,

720
01:13:47,147 --> 01:13:49,847
take everything they want and
our parents worked so hard for?

721
01:13:49,948 --> 01:13:52,905
No Kevin, I don't think it's fair.
I don't think it's fair at all.

722
01:13:53,006 --> 01:13:55,868
Are you in or are you out?

723
01:13:57,219 --> 01:14:00,031
Well, I feel like I should be out.

724
01:14:00,132 --> 01:14:03,014
But I can't stop thinking
about the coincidence that...

725
01:14:03,115 --> 01:14:06,173
from all the weekends that
we could've chosen to go camping,

726
01:14:06,274 --> 01:14:11,007
we chose that weekend.
God spared us for a reason.

727
01:14:11,387 --> 01:14:14,250
And I think he wants us
to do something.

728
01:14:14,351 --> 01:14:18,828
So I will help you Homer, but
I'm not going to murder anybody.

729
01:14:19,057 --> 01:14:22,025
All this talk scares me
to death, but...

730
01:14:23,186 --> 01:14:25,720
I think we have to
fight back anyway.

731
01:14:25,821 --> 01:14:29,564
We'll never sleep again if we don't.
-We'll never sleep again if we did.

732
01:14:29,897 --> 01:14:33,097
-What are you chicken, Chris?
-You'd know all about that, wouldn't you?

733
01:14:33,198 --> 01:14:35,644
There's nothing chicken
about staying alive, mate.

734
01:14:35,745 --> 01:14:39,440
We're not even trained for this stuff.
What would our parents say?

735
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:43,276
They'd say the most important
thing is our safety.

736
01:14:43,377 --> 01:14:46,949
They wouldn't want us dead
in exchange for them being alive.

737
01:14:49,869 --> 01:14:54,576
I suppose when the time comes,
I'll do what I have to do.

738
01:14:55,458 --> 01:14:58,291
What worries me though is that...

739
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:02,173
I can't guarantee that I'm not
gonna pack up under pressure.

740
01:15:02,932 --> 01:15:05,788
I'm so scared and...

741
01:15:06,579 --> 01:15:10,301
I think that I might just
stand there and scream.

742
01:15:10,693 --> 01:15:14,744
None of us knows how we're gonna
react when shit hits the fan.

743
01:15:14,881 --> 01:15:19,081
You've done alright so far.
Well, for a townie.

744
01:15:21,345 --> 01:15:24,612
We have to do something.
I'm not just gonna sit here.

745
01:15:24,837 --> 01:15:27,434
And do nothing.

746
01:15:32,195 --> 01:15:36,565
I'm different to all of you.
I have blood on my hands.

747
01:15:37,018 --> 01:15:40,276
I can't tell if what I did
was right or wrong.

748
01:15:40,699 --> 01:15:44,032
I'd like to think it was
to save my friends,

749
01:15:44,333 --> 01:15:47,772
or as part of some noble
crusade to save my country.

750
01:15:47,992 --> 01:15:52,858
Really it just comes down to the fact
that I valued my life over theirs.

751
01:15:53,711 --> 01:15:57,961
How many people is it okay to kill
in order to keep me alive?

752
01:15:59,995 --> 01:16:04,043
At what point do we lose our souls,
if we haven't already?

753
01:16:05,872 --> 01:16:09,529
In the end I think we just
have to trust our instincts.

754
01:16:09,829 --> 01:16:12,875
After all, it is all
we have left, isn't it?

755
01:16:13,408 --> 01:16:16,569
What do your instincs tell you?

756
01:16:26,351 --> 01:16:29,175
That it's time to go to war.

757
01:16:32,006 --> 01:16:35,060
What are we gonna do?
Blow it up?

758
01:16:35,350 --> 01:16:38,203
Cobbler's Bay is
one of their key ports.

759
01:16:38,879 --> 01:16:42,409
And this bridge
is the only way in or out.

760
01:16:42,696 --> 01:16:44,785
It's the key to everything.

761
01:16:44,886 --> 01:16:48,320
If they can't resupply their soldiers,
then they can't fight.

762
01:16:51,763 --> 01:16:55,975
They've got sentries. -We have
to find the way to distract them.

763
01:16:56,306 --> 01:16:58,837
Remember what dr Clement said?

764
01:16:58,938 --> 01:17:02,002
About how other people tried to
blow up that bridge before?

765
01:17:02,103 --> 01:17:04,103
Amateurs.

766
01:17:05,314 --> 01:17:07,755
Couple of years ago
me and some mates

767
01:17:07,856 --> 01:17:11,656
came up with the way to take
this bridge down. Just for fun.

768
01:17:11,868 --> 01:17:15,079
That's hardly reassuring,
knowing your mates.

769
01:17:17,623 --> 01:17:20,601
Can you drive a petrol tanker?

770
01:17:35,064 --> 01:17:37,466
-Hurry up.
-Okay.

771
01:17:54,083 --> 01:17:56,070
Sorry.

772
01:18:02,179 --> 01:18:04,917
-Big one?
-The big one.

773
01:18:21,528 --> 01:18:24,456
There! They are there.
In the window.

774
01:18:31,615 --> 01:18:34,445
Wait! -What?
-Can I do it?

775
01:18:35,022 --> 01:18:38,107
I've always wanted
to smash a window.

776
01:18:46,714 --> 01:18:49,149
-One more.
-Fi! Just...

777
01:18:51,437 --> 01:18:53,574
Do it!

778
01:19:30,496 --> 01:19:32,733
Fi, run!

779
01:19:36,404 --> 01:19:38,204
Stop!

780
01:19:38,605 --> 01:19:40,836
Turn around!

781
01:19:41,137 --> 01:19:43,537
Do not move!

782
01:20:36,660 --> 01:20:40,397
-Guys, are you there?
-We're all set. We can see you.

783
01:20:40,529 --> 01:20:44,488
Don't come any closer. Wait there
till we get the word from Homer.

784
01:20:44,794 --> 01:20:47,815
Lee and me are almost there.
-Lee and "I".

785
01:20:48,054 --> 01:20:52,262
Okay, we're in the position too.
I can see 10 soldiers on the bridge.

786
01:20:52,577 --> 01:20:56,404
We've only got about 15 minutes
before the next convoy comes along.

787
01:20:57,319 --> 01:21:01,111
We'll call you when we're ready.
-Okay honey, we'll be waiting.

788
01:21:05,712 --> 01:21:09,375
Did you just call him 'honey'?
-Homer. I called him 'Homer'.

789
01:21:09,518 --> 01:21:13,682
No, you just called him 'honey'.
-I didn't. -Yes you did, I heard you.

790
01:21:13,919 --> 01:21:17,988
It may have sounded like 'honey'
but I definitely said 'Homer'.

791
01:21:18,189 --> 01:21:21,372
-Go. Go.
-You gotta hiss like a snake.

792
01:21:23,239 --> 01:21:26,047
No, no, like a snake.

793
01:21:29,175 --> 01:21:34,500
So, princess Fifi has the hots
for a rough as guts Homer.

794
01:21:36,658 --> 01:21:40,095
Have you kissed him?
-Would you mind if I had?

795
01:21:40,296 --> 01:21:43,129
Me? Are you serious?
Of course not.

796
01:21:43,230 --> 01:21:45,430
I just know that
you two are close.

797
01:21:45,531 --> 01:21:48,421
-No, never like that.
-Okay, good.

798
01:21:49,832 --> 01:21:52,288
Well then, yes I have.

799
01:21:52,967 --> 01:21:55,442
Is he a good kisser?

800
01:21:55,604 --> 01:21:58,647
Actually no, I don't wanna know.
Don't tell me. It's kinda gross.

801
01:21:58,748 --> 01:22:02,493
-He's a great kisser.
-Great. Now I know.

802
01:22:09,169 --> 01:22:12,050
But he's so down on himself.

803
01:22:12,151 --> 01:22:15,118
He's got this weird thing
about my parents being lawyers.

804
01:22:15,220 --> 01:22:17,425
And he always used
to joke about it.

805
01:22:17,526 --> 01:22:19,926
But I don't think
he's really joking at all.

806
01:22:20,135 --> 01:22:23,603
Jesus, Fi, how long did it take to
figure that out? -What do you mean?

807
01:22:23,704 --> 01:22:26,704
You know the kind of guys
he knocks about. They're just...

808
01:22:26,805 --> 01:22:29,058
more at home hanging out at the pub

809
01:22:29,059 --> 01:22:31,259
than playing croquet
with your parents.

810
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:34,004
My parents don't play croquet.

811
01:22:34,205 --> 01:22:36,527
Ellie. Ellie!

812
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:39,300
Fi! Behind you!

813
01:22:39,907 --> 01:22:43,432
Homer is like two people.
He's so confident with a group,

814
01:22:43,533 --> 01:22:47,133
and then he's supershy with me.
I just don't understand.

815
01:22:47,255 --> 01:22:48,915
Ellie?

816
01:22:48,916 --> 01:22:52,363
If I could understand Homer
I'm sure I'd understand all guys.

817
01:22:52,644 --> 01:22:54,864
Like Lee?

818
01:22:55,984 --> 01:22:59,709
How did you know about that?
-C'mon Ellie, everybody knows.

819
01:22:59,810 --> 01:23:02,435
God, this is worse than recess.

820
01:23:02,536 --> 01:23:04,940
They can't hear us.

821
01:23:05,349 --> 01:23:08,341
Homer, you have to go now.
-But we're still not ready.

822
01:23:08,442 --> 01:23:12,249
There are soldiers creeping up behind
tanker and Ellie's not answering me.

823
01:23:12,899 --> 01:23:14,949
Ellie, pick up.

824
01:23:15,050 --> 01:23:19,572
Just think about it. The eight of us
are living out in the bush.

825
01:23:19,673 --> 01:23:22,924
And the entire world is
completely turned upside down.

826
01:23:23,054 --> 01:23:25,345
I'd just hate to be
responsible for ruining

827
01:23:25,446 --> 01:23:29,146
whatever little good we did have
by Lee and me having a falling out.

828
01:23:29,346 --> 01:23:33,859
Look, Ellie. I'm no expert
on relationships or anything.

829
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:36,892
But I do know that
you have this tendency

830
01:23:36,993 --> 01:23:39,293
to reason everything
through all the time,

831
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:42,266
and I just think
the future is the future.

832
01:23:42,367 --> 01:23:44,876
It has to take care of itself.

833
01:23:44,977 --> 01:23:48,032
And by the way, it's Lee and 'I'.

834
01:23:48,433 --> 01:23:50,769
Get out of the truck!

835
01:23:51,671 --> 01:23:53,958
Move! Drive!

836
01:23:56,573 --> 01:23:59,508
Here goes the brilliant plan.

837
01:24:03,148 --> 01:24:06,776
Ellie, I'm so sorry I turned it off.
-Doesn't matter.

838
01:25:01,177 --> 01:25:02,977
Here.

839
01:25:04,378 --> 01:25:06,178
Go!

840
01:25:23,482 --> 01:25:26,774
Ellie, we need the lighter.
-You were to bring it.

841
01:25:26,946 --> 01:25:30,008
No, you were to bring the lighter.

842
01:25:30,342 --> 01:25:32,778
I don't have it.

843
01:25:37,279 --> 01:25:39,879
Christ, the soldiers!

844
01:25:45,823 --> 01:25:48,689
Where the hell is Kevin going?

845
01:25:49,223 --> 01:25:53,064
Robyn, we can't get to you.
-Don't worry about us, just go!

846
01:26:41,836 --> 01:26:44,489
You guys take this one.
Corrie, you're with me.

847
01:26:44,590 --> 01:26:47,616
Run Homer, let's go!
Hurry up, they're coming!

848
01:26:48,196 --> 01:26:50,130
C'mon!

849
01:26:55,756 --> 01:26:57,547
Kevin!

850
01:26:59,728 --> 01:27:02,089
Corrie? Corrie!

851
01:27:13,966 --> 01:27:16,102
Get away!

852
01:27:26,346 --> 01:27:28,546
Come on.

853
01:27:31,247 --> 01:27:33,141
Wait!

854
01:28:33,983 --> 01:28:36,014
Gosh!

855
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:54,244
It was so much bigger than I expected.
-That's the biggest joint I've ever lit.

856
01:28:54,430 --> 01:28:57,189
Did you see the bridge?

857
01:29:05,357 --> 01:29:08,253
Corrie! Oh my God, what happened?

858
01:29:08,405 --> 01:29:11,395
She got shot as
we were driving away.

859
01:29:12,958 --> 01:29:16,808
I can't...
I can't stop the bleeding.

860
01:29:18,424 --> 01:29:20,835
We'll take her to
go see dr Clement.

861
01:29:20,936 --> 01:29:23,436
He can fix her the same way
that he fixed Lee.

862
01:29:23,537 --> 01:29:27,033
-She needs a hospital, Fi.
-I'm gonna get the Landrover.

863
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:29,828
-Ellie...
-Hey. Hey!

864
01:29:30,201 --> 01:29:32,868
You have to leave me.

865
01:29:33,227 --> 01:29:36,828
No, I'm not leaving you.
-She's right.

866
01:29:37,564 --> 01:29:41,171
It sounds cruel, but the only thing
to do is ring the bell and run.

867
01:29:41,272 --> 01:29:43,294
-What?
-No!

868
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:47,244
-No I can't leave her. I won't.
-We have to be rational about this.

869
01:29:47,425 --> 01:29:50,803
If we take her to the hospital,
we will get caught.

870
01:29:51,282 --> 01:29:54,833
No, I don't give a shit
what's rational. Alright?

871
01:29:55,579 --> 01:29:57,964
Corrie is our mate.

872
01:29:58,371 --> 01:30:01,634
She is our mate. And I...

873
01:30:04,603 --> 01:30:07,064
I love her.

874
01:30:09,144 --> 01:30:11,786
I'm taking her in.

875
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:15,663
I'm staying with her.

876
01:30:20,483 --> 01:30:22,922
I'm staying.

877
01:30:30,368 --> 01:30:32,973
Good luck, mate.

878
01:30:38,924 --> 01:30:42,487
I'll come get you when
you're better. Okay?

879
01:30:50,992 --> 01:30:53,510
Pinky swear.

880
01:31:42,689 --> 01:31:45,149
We've hit them.

881
01:31:45,479 --> 01:31:47,846
Hit them hard.

882
01:31:47,992 --> 01:31:51,734
They are gonna be coming after us
now with everything they've got.

883
01:31:52,162 --> 01:31:54,491
<i>And they did come after us.</i>

884
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,754
<i>For three weeks now,
we've seen...</i>

885
01:31:56,855 --> 01:32:00,329
<i>dozens of planes and helicopters
and search parties.</i>

886
01:32:01,903 --> 01:32:04,180
<i>But they haven't found us yet.</i>

887
01:32:04,283 --> 01:32:07,546
<i>Which means Corrie and Kevin
have told them nothing.</i>

888
01:32:13,358 --> 01:32:16,827
<i>A month ago, we were just
an average bunch of teenagers.</i>

889
01:32:17,078 --> 01:32:20,506
<i>Studying for school and
complaining about our parents.</i>

890
01:32:32,292 --> 01:32:34,730
<i>Now we're soldiers.</i>

891
01:32:34,831 --> 01:32:38,231
<i>Trapped behind enemy lines
and fighting to survive.</i>

892
01:32:39,155 --> 01:32:42,269
<i>We won't run.
We won't hide.</i>

893
01:32:42,948 --> 01:32:45,928
<i>We'll fight and keep fighting.</i>

894
01:32:46,168 --> 01:32:48,731
<i>And never give up.</i>

895
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:52,231
<i>Until this war is finally won.</i>
