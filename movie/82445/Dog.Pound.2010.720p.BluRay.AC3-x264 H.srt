1
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:18,809
(house music on stereo)

2
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:20,978
(belt jingling)

3
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:30,446
(both sighing)

4
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:37,661
(moaning, giggling)

5
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,918
- Aw! Enough of that shit!

6
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:47,880
- Shut the fuck up, bitch.

7
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,882
- Don't call me a bitch.

8
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,399
- You're so beautiful.

9
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,291
(chuckles)

10
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,961
(music volume increases)

11
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,715
(moaning)

12
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,473
(knocking)

13
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,975
- Get out of your fucking room!
Turn it lower, for God's sake!

14
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:43,977
- Sorry, Mom!

15
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,572
(siren in distance)

16
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,511
(stick breaking)

17
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,179
(screaming)

18
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:21,807
- Are you all right, kid?

19
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,604
You little fuck!
(ripping)

20
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:28,981
(screaming)

21
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,149
(tires squealing)

22
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,577
- Did you make this?
- No.

23
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,162
(grunts)

24
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,205
- Your cellmate told me
you made this.

25
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:46,915
- Don't hit me again.

26
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,918
(grunts)

27
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:52,171
Don't do that again, man!

28
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:55,048
- Are you threatening me, boy?
- I'm fucking threatening you, man!

29
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,801
- Do you know where you are?
- Fucking right, bitch!

30
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,095
Fuck you!
Don't do it again!

31
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,598
(panting)

32
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,812
- I'm gonna come back in five
and you're gonna give me a name.

33
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,732
And that's an order.

34
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,449
(sniffs)

35
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,537
- Fucking cunt!

36
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,081
Fuck you!

37
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,458
(cracking, screaming)

38
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,001
(roaring)

39
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:33,086
(gate thudding shut)

40
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,796
(lock clicking)

41
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,760
(man humming)

42
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,603
- Gentlemen, strip out of
your civilian clothes

43
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,606
and place all of your belongings
in the box with your name on it.

44
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,317
We'll give back your shoes
once this search is complete.

45
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,736
All of your belongings.

46
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,072
Shake your hair.

47
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,908
Wiggle your fingers.

48
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,618
Spread your toes.

49
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:06,828
Blow your nose.

50
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:07,996
(exhaling)

51
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,462
Now turn around.

52
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,968
Bend over.

53
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,305
Cough.

54
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,682
(coughing)

55
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:27,849
Harder.

56
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:28,934
(coughing)

57
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,102
Stand up.

58
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,937
(coughs)

59
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,355
Turn around.

60
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,150
- Okay, boys,
now we'll get you dressed.

61
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:41,113
Gentlemen, welcome to Enola Vale
Youth Correctional Facility.

62
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,115
I'm your superintendent,
Mr. Sands.

63
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,868
If you have any problems
or any questions during your stay here,

64
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,996
you will report them
to your unit supervisor,

65
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:50,831
in this case,
Officer Goodyear.

66
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,874
He will then report it to me.

67
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:55,836
As for school,
your re-socialization unit supervisor...

68
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,212
(Sands talking, indistinct)

69
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,880
... basic rules around the place.

70
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:01,091
You better be listening.

71
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,969
No weapons, no sharp items.

72
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,054
No pornographic material,
no illegal substance,

73
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,515
no tobacco, no alcohol

74
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:11,893
and no signs of gang activity
will be permitted

75
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:13,854
on the facility of Enola Vale.

76
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,897
Any questions?

77
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,316
Excellent.

78
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,740
You're 30 minutes late again.
What's your excuse this time?

79
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,742
- Did I miss something?
- That's not the point.

80
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,244
You're late and it's becoming
an ongoing habit.

81
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,830
- Were they prepped on the basics?
- I just did that.

82
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,498
- Good. Perfect timing.

83
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,668
Well, what fresh hellions
are these?

84
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,298
Angel.

85
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:45,761
Davis.

86
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,346
- Guilty as charged.

87
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,306
- Yeah, well, do me a favor,
sunshine.

88
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,515
Yank the pants up.

89
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,392
There's no gangster wannabes
on my unit.

90
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,313
Butch.

91
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,695
Gentlemen,
pick up your belongings.

92
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:04,946
Single file.

93
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,117
(man humming)

94
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,380
Where are you two mutts
coming from?

95
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,132
- We just finished
Social Studies class, Mr. G.

96
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,009
- And where are you going?
- Going to the library.

97
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,594
- I'm gone the weekend,
I come back,

98
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,554
and you're in Special Unit.
What happened?

99
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:30,847
- Nothing.
- What you do?

100
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,182
- I didn't do nothing.

101
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,559
- No, you didn't do anything.
And that makes sense.

102
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,270
They throw you in the hole
for two days for not doing nothing.

103
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:40,565
- Why are you bothering him?
He told you he didn't do anything.

104
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:44,111
- What, are you his lawyer?
- No.

105
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,029
I'm a judge.
(snickering)

106
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,825
- Pull your pants up and move on.
- All right, Mr. G.

107
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:52,953
- Like to see you out of that costume
by the end of the week too.

108
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,082
Let's go.

109
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,469
Butch, bed on the far left.
Davis, straight ahead.

110
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:10,762
Angel, right here.

111
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,515
Stow your gear and come over here
and line up.

112
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,896
Listen carefully.
This is a new day for you gentlemen.

113
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,733
No one in here cares about any felonies
you may have committed in the past.

114
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,694
The judge may have given you
a sentence,

115
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,196
but in reality, your sentence
all depends on your behavior.

116
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,948
You show some good will
towards change

117
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,492
and you get an earlier parole hearing
with the judge.

118
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,453
Am I boring you, sunshine?

119
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,914
- No, sir.

120
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:39,040
- Good.

121
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,461
'Cause I read your report
and you should be listening the closest.

122
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,589
Right now, you're all Level 1.

123
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,007
Evaluations will determine for us

124
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,843
whether you actually want to change
and rehabilitate.

125
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,430
Show us some improvements
and you can move to Level 2

126
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,015
and become a trustee.

127
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,600
You'll notice these gentlemen

128
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,060
by their sports black pants
and their polo shirts.

129
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:02,189
They've acknowledged they've made
some poor choices in life,

130
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,024
but they've proven to staff,

131
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,734
and more importantly
to themselves,

132
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,445
that they're ready to re-enter society
with the necessary skills

133
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,239
to avoid further criminal behavior.

134
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,576
Becoming a trustee
comes with a lot of privileges.

135
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,369
But if you mess up,

136
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:20,540
if you try any crazy stuff
on anybody in here or yourself

137
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,668
or you try to bust out,
well, congratulations.

138
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:27,088
You just won an orange suit
and a free trip to Special Unit.

139
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,260
So, gentlemen,
make your stay pleasant here

140
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,262
by being good to yourself,

141
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:38,558
your peers and the staff,
and I guarantee you'll be all right.

142
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,061
All right, unpack.

143
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,322
- Good, boys.
Hot bowl of shit coming right up.

144
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,574
- You stinkin' like shit.
- No, I don't.

145
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,828
- Thanks, partner.

146
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,915
(Banks): Do some dishes
or something, Loony. Fuck!

147
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,583
(Loony): Fuck your dishes!

148
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:04,793
(chuckling)

149
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,545
(Banks): Loony, he thinks he's...

150
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,348
(inhales sharply)

151
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,271
- No.

152
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,940
(CO): Hurry up.
Keep it moving.

153
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,032
- Is this seat taken?

154
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,503
- Somebody get clumsy
with the ladle?

155
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:51,881
Don't move on it, man.

156
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,593
You'll just end up in the hole
where that asshole Banks wants you.

157
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,306
The best thing...

158
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,309
just pay no mind.

159
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,519
Eventually, they'll
leave you alone like they did me.

160
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,025
I mean, that was also
because I have AIDS.

161
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,326
You know, we all know
why you're in here,

162
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:20,744
especially Banks.

163
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,210
(indistinct)

164
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,808
(boy talking, indistinct)

165
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,005
- You like that one, huh?

166
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,841
- It's pretty cool.

167
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,887
- It's for all the virgins
I corrupted, man.

168
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,114
(splashing)

169
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,577
(splashing)

170
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,663
- Yo, drop it and flush it!

171
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,123
- Don't worry 'bout it.

172
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,668
What the fuck?

173
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,212
- Throw me back my toothpaste, man.
- Fuck you! Get it yourself!

174
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,092
(muttering): Fucking prairie nigger.

175
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,553
(boy): Sal!
- What?

176
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,846
- Come here.

177
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,181
All right, gentlemen.
Let's settle down.

178
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,142
Sal, get back in your bed.

179
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,730
Good night, gentlemen.

180
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,713
- Hey, Goodyear.
- Morning. How was the night?

181
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,089
- No problems.

182
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:24,260
Control, open gate B2, please.

183
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,096
(lock clicking)

184
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,307
- Thank you, sir.
- Have a good day.

185
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,600
- You too.

186
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,478
(lock clicking)

187
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,906
(sighing)

188
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,450
Control, open dormitory A1.

189
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,328
(lock clicking)

190
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,122
Wakey, wakey!

191
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,458
Hands off snaky! Let's go!

192
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,336
Let's go, gentlemen.

193
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,755
A two-minute window
to get the bed made.

194
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,636
Ends of the bed when you're done.

195
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,181
Let's go, guys.
Shake it off.

196
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,830
Mr. Angel Ortiz,
grab your bucket and mop.

197
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,081
Come with me.

198
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,761
(gate closing)

199
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:53,975
- He's right here.

200
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,195
- What's up, man?

201
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,782
How's it going, man?

202
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,075
- What's up?

203
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,994
(Banks): You just get here?
(Davis): Yeah.

204
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,120
- Yeah, that's cool.

205
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,788
How much time did you get?

206
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,790
- Three months, man.
- Oh!

207
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,792
- Just three?
- Just three.

208
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,753
- Shit!
- That ain't shit, cuz.

209
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,880
You know, I just did
three months fucking three times.

210
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:27,342
I could do that on my fucking head
in the hole. You know what I mean?

211
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:30,595
- Yeah. Yeah.
So how long you got, man?

212
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:33,431
- What do you mean,
how long I got?

213
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,850
Who the fuck's business is that, man?

214
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,019
- Just asking, man.
I don't know.

215
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,980
- Don't be asking no stupid
punk-ass questions around here.

216
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,316
You'll go get yourself hurt, boy.

217
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:44,943
- Yeah, all right, man.

218
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,571
- You looking to get fucked up?
- No, man.

219
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,114
- Looking to get fucked up?
- Relax, relax!

220
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,824
- Huh? Looking to get fucked up?

221
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:53,952
(snickering)

222
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,788
Just fucking with you, man.
This nigger's a bitch, cuz.

223
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,832
- No, man.
- Brush it off. Calm down, man.

224
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,293
Your boots, though, man...

225
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,254
They're looking, uh,
pretty nice, man.

226
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,465
Where did you get those at?

227
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,050
- At the mall.
- At the mall?

228
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,094
- Yeah.
- How much were they?

229
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,638
- They were, like,
I don't know, 100 bucks.

230
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,557
- Your mom give you those kicks
or something? A little present?

231
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:17,809
- From mommy?
- No, man.

232
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:18,977
- No?

233
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,145
- No, man. I bought these.
- You bought 'em?

234
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,897
- Yeah.
- You a hustler, all right.

235
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,065
- Yeah.

236
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:27,986
- Fuck! Hustler hustlin'.
What size are you, 10? Big man?

237
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,029
Let me check them boots out.
Cop 'em over.

238
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,531
- No, man. I'm only an 8.

239
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,659
- What the fuck you mean,
you is only an 8? Don't look like no 8!

240
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,662
- You fucking lying to my boy?
- Don't look like a fucking 8 to me!

241
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,122
- All right, man.

242
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,583
- Come on, man.
Don't be a bitch, man.

243
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,256
- They are nice-ass boots.
- Whoo-hee!

244
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,925
- Yeah. I lookin' fresh to death.
You feeling me?

245
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,678
- Man, fresh as fuck.
- How am I looking, cuz?

246
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:54,804
- Nice. Nice, cuz.

247
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,889
- How am I looking?
- They look good, man...

248
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,266
- They're nice-ass boots.

249
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,477
- Can I have it back now?
- Just feeling it out. They're comfy.

250
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,563
- Let me see that other one.
- Try that shit.

251
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:07,984
I'm gonna try that.

252
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,112
It's all good, man.
It's all good. You feeling me?

253
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,698
- Fuck, they're real nice, bro,
but fuck, too big for me, man.

254
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,159
- Let me check that.
Let me try both of them on at once.

255
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:17,952
Now that they're on my feet,

256
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,913
I don't really feel like
taking them off.

257
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:23,249
They're too comfy. Plus, I'm fresh.
You know what I mean?

258
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,877
Some boots right there,
they ain't tricking. They're nice.

259
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,046
Don't take no offence,
you know what I mean?

260
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,547
Let's peace-out of here, boys.

261
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,508
Fucking bitch.

262
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,635
(laughing)

263
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,891
- Fuck!
(kicks bucket)

264
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,893
(man humming)

265
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,947
- Wake up.

266
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,033
The floor's not gonna mop itself.

267
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,631
(liquid dripping)

268
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,306
(Banks): Let's do it.

269
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,936
(Loony): Faggot.
(boys laughing)

270
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,521
(clearing throat)

271
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:27,897
(Banks): Fucking bitch.

272
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,108
(Loony): You got him--
- Butch!

273
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,111
What did I just say to you?
Get back to work.

274
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,251
(boy talking, indistinct)

275
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,294
(boys laughing)

276
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,547
- What's up, Shadow?

277
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,348
- Wipe that smile off.

278
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,351
(Banks): That's it, boys.

279
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,770
Let's get this shit cleaned up.

280
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,024
(indistinct)

281
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,379
(man on radio, indistinct)

282
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:47,935
(whispering): Loony.
Get the fuck up, man.

283
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,813
Get the fuck up.

284
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,614
Get the fuck up, man.

285
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:09,123
Loony. You go first.

286
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:23,262
(gasps, grunting)

287
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,264
(groaning)

288
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,063
What the fuck you doing, man?
Not in the face, nigger!

289
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,148
(sniffling)
Shut up, man!

290
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,943
I swear to God,
if you fucking rat, man,

291
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:40,238
I'll kill you my fucking self, man.
You feel me?

292
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,205
(gasping)

293
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,969
(coughing continues)

294
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,558
- Time's up.
Get in front of your bunks.

295
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:10,935
Ready for inspection.

296
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,621
You call this making a bed?

297
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:34,000
- Whatever. Fuck.

298
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,463
Why the fuck did you do that?

299
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,300
- You better learn to control
your mouth, kid.

300
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,137
- I'm gonna mess it up tonight
anyways.

301
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,346
Fuck, like...

302
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:51,434
- You are on solitary report
by supper.

303
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:55,313
Now make your bed properly.

304
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,533
(Goodyear):
Stand up straight, Frank.

305
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,878
- All right, boys.
Let's go. Wash up.

306
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,839
Come on! Move it!

307
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:24,633
Let's go.

308
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:26,802
- You stay put.

309
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:35,394
That looks kind of painful.
Wanna tell me what happened?

310
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:38,606
- I slipped and fell.

311
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,612
- Do I look like an asshole to you?

312
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,409
Well, fortunately for us,
we have some procedures in place.

313
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,662
You and I are gonna issue a report.

314
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,331
- And what good would that do?

315
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,959
I just told you I slipped
and fell in the dark.

316
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:01,128
- In the dark?
- Yeah.

317
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:06,092
- Well, maybe a few days in solitary,
you'll come up with a few more details.

318
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:07,468
- Maybe.

319
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,263
Can I go?

320
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,100
- Yeah, you can go.

321
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,273
Don't slip.

322
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,026
(all chattering)

323
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,998
(chattering continues)

324
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:03,274
- Fuck you, Banks!
- Banks, knock it off!

325
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,484
(man humming)

326
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:08,070
Control, open gates B1.

327
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,720
- All right, I want two lines!

328
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:35,055
Side by side in front of the dirt.
Line 'em up.

329
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,606
(beeping)

330
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:50,404
Banks!

331
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:54,033
(boys talking, indistinct)

332
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,749
- How are you, son?
(Banks): Sir, how are you?

333
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,375
- You doing a good job?

334
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,711
- I've been out of the dirt
for a while now.

335
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:08,881
- ... an interview with construction
after this.

336
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,549
- Yeah, I'd like that.

337
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:16,222
(laughing)

338
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:18,724
- Aw!
(laughing)

339
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,189
- Max!

340
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:28,150
Can you at least pretend
that you're working?

341
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,038
(engine running)

342
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,499
- Kill it, Banks. Shut it down.

343
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:46,335
(whistling)

344
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,462
Lunch!

345
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,761
(Sands): Goodyear.
- Move.

346
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,570
- Sit straight.

347
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:18,534
You were transferred
to Enola Vale

348
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,328
because you assaulted
a correctional officer.

349
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:24,707
Not 24 hours inside,
you wake up all bruised up.

350
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:30,713
I'm going to ask you for the last time:
what happened?

351
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:33,674
- I slipped and fell.

352
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,843
- Butch, I know you're not gonna rat,

353
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:38,387
but our concern is
for your personal safety.

354
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:41,432
- Look, I am not your punishment.

355
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:47,688
But if you refuse to cooperate,
I have no choice but to isolate you.

356
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:49,189
- Okay.

357
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,736
- Goodyear, get him out of here.

358
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,831
(knocking)

359
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,542
- Come on in.

360
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,678
Hurry up, Max.
I don't have all day.

361
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,514
- What's the rush,
Miss Biggs?

362
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,896
- So, what is it today, Max?
Is it about your HIV test?

363
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:32,107
Don't worry, it's negative,
you can stop spreading those rumors.

364
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,153
- No, the truth is...

365
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:39,531
I've fallen deeply in love
with a woman

366
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:41,700
and I just...
I don't know how to tell her.

367
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,410
- Well, I can't help you with that.

368
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,412
Maybe Sands can give you
some good advice.

369
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:48,165
- You know, I wanna tell her
so many things.

370
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,917
I got so much inside,
I just wanna...

371
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,085
(inhales sharply)

372
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:52,628
I just...

373
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,838
You know, I wrote her a poem,
because, you know,

374
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,591
poetry is really the only way
I can truly express myself.

375
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:58,842
Can I read it to you?

376
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,638
(clears throat)

377
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,556
"She's a caretaker,

378
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:07,810
"but there's no one
to take care of her.

379
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,229
"She listens to others

380
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:13,065
"to avoid listening to her."

381
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,150
That part doesn't rhyme.
It's just an early draft, though.

382
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:18,237
"In a world surrounded by men,
I am her only admirer.

383
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,738
"The clock is ticking,
she's getting older,

384
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:21,532
"but still no rock on the finger--"

385
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,242
- Max, I get the point.

386
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,703
I got a lot of work here.
I think you should go.

387
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,665
- Miss Biggs,
I am seriously offended here.

388
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,918
I don't know if you know this,
but when it comes to creativity,

389
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:35,629
a subject us artists
are particularly sensitive to,

390
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:38,590
I'd really appreciate it
if you didn't interrupt me again.

391
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,759
(sighing)

392
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,094
- Fine.

393
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:47,141
- "I dream she's...

394
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:49,268
"lying naked on fur,
glistening crotch

395
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,644
tickled by her pinkie finger."

396
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:53,313
- Enough Max!
Get out of here now!

397
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,024
- You don't get it.

398
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,402
- You crossed the line big time.
Get out now.

399
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,571
- Since one of us
doesn't see the value in art,

400
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,114
there won't be a next time.

401
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,708
(door closing, opening)

402
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,003
You probably thought
I was alluding to you in that poem.

403
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,505
Uh, I wasn't,
so sorry to disappoint.

404
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:20,007
And have a good day.

405
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,593
- Davis.

406
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,889
You know, man,
when you first come here and shit,

407
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:28,682
boys thought you was a bitch.

408
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,684
At least you ain't rat
on nobody, man.

409
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,519
So, you know, we're all straight?

410
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:35,439
- Cool.
- Everything's all right, man.

411
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:36,607
- Thanks, man.

412
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:41,028
- What the fuck is it
you've got on going down there?

413
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,572
Pissin' sweat out your armpits, man!

414
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,824
- Yeah, man, I need to change
my shirt or some shit.

415
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,326
- What the fuck's wrong
with you, man?

416
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,745
Why you always walking 'round here
all worried and shit, man?

417
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,747
You ain't gotta be scared.
You scared?

418
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:55,250
- No, man. I'm not scared.
- You ain't got no reason to be scared.

419
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:57,002
You know what I mean, player?

420
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,587
- Yeah.
- Everything's all good.

421
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,005
Hustlers ain't scared of shit.

422
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,381
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

423
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,091
- You is a hustler, right?
- Yeah.

424
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,594
- What you hustlin'?
So you hustlin' some weed and shit?

425
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:06,762
- No, man. Pills and coke.

426
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,680
- You hustle that "yay"?
- Yeah.

427
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:11,099
- Movin' that "yayo"?
You like that raw shit?

428
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:12,726
- Yeah.
- You like that shit?

429
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,269
- Mm-hmm.

430
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:17,314
- Yeah, so, uh, what if I had
some of that raw shit, man?

431
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:18,857
You want a bump?

432
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,734
- What, you have some of that?

433
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:21,902
- Yo, Loony.

434
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,488
Get that white shit out
for the pretty boy, man.

435
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,114
He wanna get fucked up.

436
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:27,866
- All right. See you later.

437
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,785
- Hey, what the fuck
you doing in here?

438
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:33,413
We're doing some big-man business.
Get the fuck out of here!

439
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:37,835
- Nice throw, you fucking faggot!
I'm gonna cut you up right now, bitch,

440
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,920
and all your little bitches
are gonna see.

441
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,339
- Are you shitting me, Sal?
- Yo, fuck you!

442
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:43,924
(stamps foot)
(laughing)

443
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:47,678
Suck on my nuts, mutt!

444
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,721
- You got that white shit
for me Loony?

445
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:57,062
Cut you a six, man.
Don't even worry about it.

446
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,693
It's all straight.

447
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,906
Get that into you, man.
That's some good.

448
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,786
(Davis sniffing)
- Oh, shit!

449
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,580
- How you like that, man?

450
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:16,540
Is that good shit?
(sniffing)

451
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:17,791
- It's different.

452
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,711
- Yeah, that's just 'cause it's pure.
Don't worry about it.

453
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,004
(sniffing)

454
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:23,422
(snickering)

455
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:46,403
Shhh! Just be quiet, man.
Shhh! Be quiet.

456
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,739
- Yeah.
- Just be easy.

457
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,782
Everything's okay, man.

458
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,911
- Yeah.
- You're just tripping.

459
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,954
- Yeah.
- It's all good.

460
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:58,457
- Yeah.
- Shhh!

461
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,666
(chuckling)

462
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,376
You feel good, man.

463
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:05,088
It is the best feeling ever, man.

464
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:07,215
Deep into your hole, man.

465
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:08,550
(soft grunt)

466
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:12,387
- You feel so good.
You're gonna be fine.

467
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:13,847
You love being fucked up.

468
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,015
- No.

469
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,601
(chuckling)

470
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,019
(snickering)

471
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,270
What?

472
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,939
What you guys give me?

473
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:23,023
- Shhh!

474
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,858
Just some special medicine, man.

475
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,653
Just the good medicine.

476
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,237
You love it, man.

477
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:32,032
You feel good, dog.

478
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,743
(baby talk): Oh, look at these!

479
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:36,370
- That's the good shit, man.

480
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:37,913
Don't wake up.

481
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,873
Just go to sleep.

482
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,876
- Hey, is that your mom
and your sister in this photo?

483
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:45,879
Damn, that bitch is fine!

484
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:48,882
Tell that bitch to come see me
next visiting day, man.

485
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,092
I'll beat that pussy up.

486
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:51,385
(both chuckling)

487
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:54,513
- Yeah, you know,
your mom was just here.

488
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:55,597
(Loony): Yeah, man.

489
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:58,892
- You know,
she left happier than she came.

490
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:02,020
- I'm so sad she left.
I miss her already.

491
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,732
- Yeah, you know,
she was sad when she was here.

492
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,192
- No.

493
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,820
- She was looking for you.
- You missed her.

494
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,738
- But she found me.

495
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:14,783
- No!
- You know, she was so beautiful.

496
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:15,951
(whimpering)

497
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,786
She wants me.

498
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,162
(whimpering)

499
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,872
You know,
your mom loves me.

500
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,082
- No.

501
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,002
- Your mom calls me Daddy.
(Davis): NO!

502
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,379
- Shut up, man.
Shut the fuck up.

503
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:28,797
- Where is she? Mom!

504
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,049
- Shut up, man!
He's a fucking heat bag.

505
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:33,093
Fuck it. Let's go.
Let's go, man.

506
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,595
(whimpering)
Fucking too much.

507
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,097
(screaming)

508
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:41,852
(whimpering)

509
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,021
(woman singing on radio, indistinct)

510
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:48,191
(grunting)

511
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,781
(grunting)

512
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,078
- Help...

513
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:04,332
Help!

514
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,172
Help!

515
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,427
- Get on your feet, boy.
- I can't.

516
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,554
- Come on, get up.
- No.

517
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,014
- Come on, boy.
Get on your feet.

518
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,098
(groaning)

519
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:21,308
Come on.

520
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,312
Come on.

521
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,689
(grunting)

522
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,234
(whimpering)

523
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,784
Stand here.
Don't move.

524
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,952
- Oh! Oh!
(gasping)

525
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,215
- Come here.

526
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:54,966
Swallow.

527
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,844
(vomiting)

528
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:05,102
(retching)

529
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,313
(spitting)

530
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,532
(breathing)

531
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:23,578
Solitary Control.

532
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,039
Unlock 7.

533
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,249
(lock clicking)

534
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,675
This is not a punishment.
It's for your own good.

535
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:39,678
Try to drink lots of water
to flush that shit out of your system.

536
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:44,057
(lock clicking)

537
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,309
(breathing)

538
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,901
(shuddering)

539
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:08,915
I wait along the borders of disdain

540
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,253
Staring in

541
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,671
- Open your mouth.

542
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:16,673
What I would give

543
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,593
To be within your arms

544
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,386
Thank you.

545
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:23,847
Dry and warm

546
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,519
- Where's the file, eh? Come on. Oh!
- Stop it.

547
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:32,022
- Where's those files that you stole?
- Stop it.

548
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:36,234
Give me the scent of free

549
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:39,863
Syringa tree

550
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:44,326
It's final call

551
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:51,166
Lonely voice upon a mountaintop

552
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,170
Shouting out

553
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:01,343
The secrets of a generation told

554
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:06,264
All the lies

555
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:13,396
Blind and riding
on the ocean's spine

556
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,732
No fault of mine

557
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,067
(Goodyear): Davis.

558
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:23,240
Drowning is what I've perfected for

559
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:25,825
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

560
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:27,327
All my life

561
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,537
- Hasty!
(laughing)

562
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:30,789
- What happened here?

563
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:34,167
- Getting a little rough.

564
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,211
- No, man, I can't wait
to dig up ditches again tomorrow.

565
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,130
- I don't care.
- Should be a good time.

566
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:41,508
- That's all he cares about.
- Wishful thoughts, eh?

567
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:45,512
- Banks, let's go.
Good night, gentlemen.

568
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:52,686
Give me

569
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,773
The scent of free

570
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,109
Syringa tree

571
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,487
Crowning me

572
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,072
My victory march

573
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,534
The marble arch

574
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:10,245
Trumpet horn

575
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,706
It's final call

576
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,641
- All right, boys.

577
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,310
Go back to the dorms,

578
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,645
wash up, change your clothes.

579
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:38,064
Move out.

580
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:41,443
(Spanish)

581
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,330
(man speaking Spanish on TV)

582
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,687
- Yo, faggot,
throw the ball back.

583
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:20,565
(Spanish)

584
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,776
Yo, I'm talking to you, faggot!

585
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,032
- Look, fuck you, man,
all right?

586
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,742
- What the fuck
did you just say to me?

587
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:34,412
You want me to fuck you up,
faggot?

588
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,707
Got your friend here.
What are you--

589
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,793
(screaming)

590
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,212
Ow!

591
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,005
(groaning)

592
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:48,385
- You get the fuck back!
Where the fuck's Banks?

593
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,136
- He's upstairs.
- Thank you.

594
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:51,596
Let's go.

595
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,411
Let's go.

596
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,339
Keep watch.

597
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:27,841
- All right.

598
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,140
(grunts)

599
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:38,560
(groaning)

600
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,897
(thudding and groaning)

601
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,361
(gurgling)

602
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:56,244
(grunting)

603
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,746
(panting)

604
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:00,832
(gurgling)

605
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:05,420
(grunts)

606
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,005
- Davis!

607
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,217
Get rid of it.

608
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:22,312
-10-99, rec room.
What the hell happened here?

609
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,522
On your belly.
Arms by your side.

610
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:30,862
Who did this to you?

611
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,578
Who did this to him?

612
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,205
- Don't know.

613
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,879
- Sands to Control.

614
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:51,508
10-66, lavatory, dorm A.

615
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,887
- Get to the end of the bed,
both of you, now.

616
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,518
What did I say to you?

617
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:05,271
I said no retaliation,
you fucking moron!

618
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,148
- What are you talking about?

619
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,192
- You really do think I'm stupid,
don't you?

620
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,568
- No, I don't.

621
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:13,655
- You think you're the first tough guy
to walk through these halls?

622
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:17,659
Think you're the first guy to ever lay
a beat down on somebody?

623
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,370
- Probably not.

624
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:24,040
- Well, I know I'm not your first CO,
so let's go, you and me.

625
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,209
(scoffs)

626
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:29,254
- Yo, he didn't fucking do anything.
Chill!

627
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:31,548
- Shut your mouth.
- Don't do that again.

628
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:33,383
- Don't do what again?

629
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:36,636
- Don't fucking do that again.
- Come on, let's go.

630
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,974
Come on. Throw down.

631
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,601
(inhales sharply)

632
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,875
- Oh! Baby!

633
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:11,129
Oh, my sweetie.
(whispering): Okay, Mom.

634
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,305
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

635
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:24,559
- Are the kids still picking on you?
- No one's picking on me, Mom.

636
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,769
I took care of that on my own,
all right?

637
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:30,565
- Baby, I'm taking care of it.
I filed a suit against this institution.

638
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:33,318
- Why the fuck
would you do that, Mom?

639
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,613
- Baby, I called Uncle Conrad,

640
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,073
and he has put me in touch
with a top lawyer.

641
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,911
So what can I tell the lawyer?
When can he come and visit you?

642
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,788
- You can tell him to go fuck himself.

643
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:47,832
- Davis.

644
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,584
- I gotta go, Mom.

645
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,419
- No, sweetie.
Let me help you.

646
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:52,795
- No.

647
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:00,470
- Remove the hat, please.

648
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:12,315
(Spanish)

649
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:18,488
(Spanish)

650
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,324
(snickers)

651
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,450
(Spanish)

652
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:23,576
(snickering)

653
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,953
- It's good.
(Spanish)

654
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:29,207
Ah! That's...

655
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:32,919
And your family is missing you, huh?

656
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:35,880
(Spanish)

657
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:40,551
(Spanish)
- You keep on saying that.

658
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:42,595
You keep on saying that.
Whatever.

659
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:44,597
You guys aren't doing anything, so...

660
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:03,700
(banging and rattling)

661
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:04,826
- Boys!

662
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:06,786
(boys hooting)

663
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:11,791
(hooting)

664
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:26,597
- ... they had the door unlocked.

665
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:28,808
We opened it up
and it was just sitting there.

666
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:31,394
It was just sitting there.

667
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,896
It was just like... like...
Watch this right here.

668
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,565
Just fucking sitting there...

669
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,567
(talking, indistinct)

670
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:41,696
(boys talking, indistinct)

671
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:45,450
- Hey, give me your bread!
- There's this special school...

672
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:02,884
(talking, indistinct)

673
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:19,901
- Hey, yo, are you Butch?

674
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:22,737
- Who wants to know?

675
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:25,156
- This nigger Shadow
wants to talk to you.

676
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:27,784
- For what?

677
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,870
- Don't know.

678
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:45,510
- Harrel, could you please
close the door?

679
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:53,267
(door being closed)

680
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,729
It's nice to see everyone here.

681
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,941
Let's start by grading the day.

682
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:01,776
Who wants to go first?

683
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,781
Okay, I'll go first.

684
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:09,659
For me, today is a 6...

685
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:11,828
because this morning

686
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:15,122
I lost my temper in traffic
with a jerk at a red light.

687
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:17,625
Butch?

688
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:20,586
- Seven.
- You wanna tell us why?

689
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:22,797
- Just got out
of the fucking hole today.

690
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:26,175
- Good.
- Zero.

691
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,679
- Do you want to tell us why?

692
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:34,308
- No.

693
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:37,019
- Frank, you've been at zero now
for months.

694
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:40,356
Is there nothing that's positive?

695
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:43,651
- No.

696
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:46,571
- Okay, we can talk
about that later.

697
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:50,157
Harrel, can you read
what we're talking about today?

698
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:54,912
- "Evaluating and rel... re-label..."

699
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,081
(imitates stammering)

700
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,167
- Shut up, man.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

701
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:01,669
I'll read it.

702
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,379
"Anger and aggression."

703
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:07,049
I think we all realize
that everybody feels anger,

704
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:10,011
but not everybody can control it,

705
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:12,847
which is why
you guys are here today.

706
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:17,018
So anger is a good thing
if you can control it,

707
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:20,855
but it's a definite disadvantage
if you can't control it.

708
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:23,941
So, let's start by talking
about what makes us angry.

709
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:25,902
Harrel, what makes you angry?

710
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:29,363
- That I'm not next to you at night,
Miss Biggs.

711
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:30,656
- Harrel, that's enough.

712
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:33,784
- What kind of ass-ugly nigger like you
would want to get a girl like her?

713
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:35,536
- Don't fucking call me no nigger!

714
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:37,371
- Thank you, gentlemen,
for going down.

715
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:39,790
- What's wrong with you?
- Frank, what about you?

716
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:41,500
What makes you angry?

717
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:43,711
- Fat people.

718
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:46,756
They walk slowly in the middle
of the hallway.

719
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:50,217
They're always sweating,
farting, funking up the dorm.

720
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:53,137
Takes them an hour for them
to drop fat,

721
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:55,056
anaconda shits
while I'm face-to-face with them

722
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:58,142
trying to wash my face
or brush my motherfucking teeth.

723
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,728
- That's a lot of f-words.
- Blame your mom.

724
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:03,481
- My mom?

725
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:06,275
- For giving you the big-ass nostrils
that look like sunglasses, son.

726
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:08,778
(laughing)
- This is a good example of--

727
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:11,822
- Every time we're talking,
you know what it really does?

728
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:12,907
- What?
- It pisses me off.

729
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:15,117
One day, I'm gonna get up
and snap your neck.

730
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:18,245
- Move those lips so much.
- You wanna test me?

731
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:19,914
- I'm right here!
- I'll break your neck.

732
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:22,833
(Biggs): This is really--
- You ain't making no moves.

733
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:24,752
- That's nothing. I'll show you.

734
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,462
- Sit!

735
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,588
Boys, that's enough.

736
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:30,591
- You wanna fucking do this?
- Frank, that's enough.

737
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,760
- What are you gonna do?
- No touching! Break it up.

738
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:35,471
(all talking)
Break it up!

739
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,765
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Right now!

740
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:39,266
- Let's do this!
I'm right here!

741
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:40,685
You wanna go?

742
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:42,979
You wanna go?
Let's go!

743
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,106
- Emergency A-23.
Send me a CO now.

744
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:46,649
(shouting)

745
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,028
- I'll, uh... I'll come and see you
after the family visits.

746
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:52,780
Okay, bro?

747
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:54,073
- Settle down!

748
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,412
- Get off him!
- Stop it!

749
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:00,955
- Let go!

750
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:04,709
- You want some, huh?
- Frank!

751
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:07,461
Okay, take him!

752
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:09,255
- I got you, baby!

753
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:11,632
- You are done!
You hear that?

754
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,009
(chuckling)

755
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:23,728
- Here. I gotta go.
The CO's waiting for me upstairs.

756
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,647
- Let me see the other guy's cut.

757
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:28,149
- What?

758
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:30,151
- Let me see the other guy's cut.

759
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:32,945
Oh, here we go!

760
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:38,159
- Shadow paid for that.
He's expecting it.

761
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:40,327
- Turn around
and spread your legs.

762
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:43,664
- There's a fucking CO waiting--
- Turn around and spread your legs.

763
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:46,917
- That's not how it works.

764
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:48,169
(chuckles)

765
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:56,552
- I don't like sneaky people
doing sneaky shit behind my back.

766
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,013
- Don't know what you're talking about,
but we have a system here.

767
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:02,141
- Fuck your system.
Today is my way.

768
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:14,820
(bed creaking)

769
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,830
(rustling, bed creaking)

770
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:26,540
- What the hell?

771
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:29,502
Fuck off with that shit, man!

772
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:31,045
Fuck!

773
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:32,880
Or tell us what you're thinkin'.

774
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:34,715
- Shit, man!
You just ruined it.

775
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,550
(groaning)

776
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:38,886
- Tell us one of your lady stories, B.
- Good idea!

777
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:40,596
- Yeah, boy!
(all): Yeah, yeah!

778
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:44,100
- Yeah, man!
- Oh! All right.

779
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:45,518
- Make it good.

780
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:48,062
- So I'm sleeping over
at my girl's house, right?

781
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:51,357
And she's on the rag,
so she just wants to go to sleep.

782
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,609
I got the worst case
of blue balls, all right?

783
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,069
(all groaning)

784
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:57,279
- Fuck that bitch, dog.
Fuck that bitch!

785
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,156
(all laughing)

786
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:02,993
- So I... I just go downstairs
to the living room.

787
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:04,578
I'm in my boxers.

788
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:07,915
And chilling out, throw on the TV
and I just light up a "J".

789
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:09,208
(chattering on TV)

790
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:16,298
But then the front door opens.
(door opening)

791
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:18,425
And who walks in?

792
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:19,885
Her fucking mom!

793
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:21,595
I think she's gonna
either bitch me out

794
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:24,348
or make some small talk
and go off to bed, but no.

795
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:26,267
She takes off her jacket.

796
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:30,312
She's wearing this dress that makes
her titties just pop right out.

797
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,274
And then she comes
and she sits right next to me.

798
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:37,653
I don't know what the hell to say,
so I'm just trying to watch TV.

799
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:41,157
But I could see out of the corner
of my eye that's she's looking at me.

800
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:44,410
And then she says:
"Can I get a drag of that?"

801
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:47,204
And I'm like: "Sure".

802
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:49,498
So I'm watching her smoke this thing,

803
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,709
and she's got these big,
juicy lips,

804
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:54,211
and she's getting red lipstick
all over the tip of it.

805
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:58,132
And she's blowing smoke in my face,
and I'm trying to concentrate on TV.

806
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,842
But when she gives the spliff back,

807
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:03,095
some ash falls right on my boxers.

808
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:04,722
And before I can even do anything,

809
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:08,893
she bends over and blows the ash off
with her mouth.

810
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,978
And the bitch just sits back and says:

811
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:13,063
"I'm gonna go to bed now."

812
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:16,150
I'm watching her go,
and before she gets to the doorway,

813
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:19,028
she turns back and says:
"Good night, Davis."

814
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:20,571
(all groaning)

815
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:23,324
- You want that bitch!
You want that, white boy!

816
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:25,326
(all shouting and laughing)

817
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:28,078
- So, what the fuck would you do?
What would you do?

818
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:30,080
I knew I had to do something, right?

819
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:32,082
I'm not a fucking idiot.
So I start...

820
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:34,752
I start sneaking up the stairs
really slowly.

821
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,630
And I walk into her room
really, really slowly.

822
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:38,923
She can't hear me.

823
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,883
And when I get there,

824
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,135
she's just combing her hair
in her vanity mirror.

825
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:46,513
And she's just, like,
looking all sultry, all sexy.

826
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:49,141
And then when she notices me
standing there,

827
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:50,476
what does she say?

828
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:53,854
"Would you help me
with my zipper?"

829
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:57,024
(boys cheering)
(laughing)

830
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:00,611
- Mommy's naughty!

831
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:03,280
- Damn, son!
- So now I'm fucking...

832
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:05,658
Now I'm standing behind her, right?

833
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:08,869
I'm standing behind her,
unzipping her dress,

834
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:11,705
and she starts leaning forward
towards the mirror

835
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:13,207
so she could see her face
closer in the mirror.

836
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:16,752
And that means that her ass
is back up against my dick,

837
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,128
like, brushing against me.

838
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:21,257
And I don't know what the fuck
goes through my head,

839
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:24,385
but I slap her ass and then I go:

840
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:26,887
Lay back on the bed, bitch,
and open your legs.

841
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:28,973
"What the fuck did you just say?"

842
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,267
And then she grabs me
by the throat,

843
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:33,060
throws me down
on that fucking bed,

844
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:36,063




jumps on me
and starts sucking on my face, man.

845
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,898
(all cheering)

846
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:39,942
- Yeah! Yeah!

847
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:42,278
That's my boy!

848
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:44,280
(all laughing)

849
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:51,203
- Whoa!

850
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:53,372
(all laughing and talking)

851
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,713
(whistle)

852
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:05,342
- Good morning, ladies!
Gather round the middle.

853
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:14,560
Let's see how your team spirit
is this morning.

854
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:16,729
We're gonna play a game
called dodge ball.

855
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:18,939
Now mix up into two teams.

856
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:43,380
We're not gonna have
any of this bullshit

857
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:44,923
on my court this morning.

858
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:48,218
You ain't no wiggers,
no niggers, no fucking crackers.

859
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:50,512
I don't give a shit
what you think you is.

860
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:54,224
You're a bunch of stray dogs
that got locked up in this dog pound

861
00:55:55,226 --> 00:55:56,518
and you all stink the same!

862
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,270
Now mix this shit up!

863
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:03,817
Sweat Marks,
get your ass over there now.

864
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:05,444
(boys laughing)

865
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:08,739
Anybody else want my foot in their ass?
Now mix this shit up!

866
00:56:16,414 --> 00:56:18,290
My rules are simple.

867
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,417
Strike your opponent with the ball.

868
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:22,378
Dodge it, catch it

869
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:25,047
and do not step on the line
or your team loses.

870
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,174
Ready?

871
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:29,218
(all shouting)

872
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:33,138
On your mark... set...

873
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:35,015
(whistle)

874
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:43,941
You're out!

875
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:46,819
Come on!

876
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:50,989
You're out, big boy!

877
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:54,868
Come on, man. You're gone.
(all shouting)

878
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:01,250
(shouting, indistinct)

879
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:03,961
This is your time
to get your aggression out.

880
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:05,796
Now, brother!
(whistle)

881
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:07,506
You're out! You're out.

882
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:10,134
Let's go! Come on!

883
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,387
- Come on!
- Get him!

884
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:15,556
- Come on!
Come on, take him out!

885
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:17,724
- Sweat Marks!

886
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:19,560
- Yeah, Sweat Marks!

887
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:23,063
(all chanting):
Sweat Marks! Sweat Marks!

888
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:24,440
- Oh!

889
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,483
(all): Sweat Marks!
Sweat Marks!

890
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:27,818
- One more!

891
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:29,778
(all): Sweat Marks!
Sweat Marks!

892
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,536
(all cheering)

893
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:45,335
(cheering and whistling)

894
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:47,754
- Yeah!
You're my bitch now!

895
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:49,923
(coughing)
Oh, shit!

896
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:51,425
(boys chuckling)

897
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:52,801
(Angel): Yo, man,
what's in there?

898
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:56,138
(Max): Sour OJ,
bread and a lot of sugar.

899
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:58,557
(Davis): Angel, was that your dad
that came to visit today?

900
00:57:58,725 --> 00:57:59,933
- Yep.

901
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:01,685
- When's your mom gonna come?

902
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:06,482
- Man, I'll fucking slit your throat
if you go there.

903
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:07,608
- What?
- Seriously.

904
00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:10,277
When's you mom gonna come.
Is she cute?

905
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:12,196
- I don't know, fuck.

906
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:14,323
- You can tell if a woman's pretty
even if it's your mom.

907
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,783
- I dunno.
- Is she an attractive woman?

908
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:17,993
- She's my mom, man!

909
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,787
- Would you have sex with her
if you were not her son?

910
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:22,414
(Davis laughing)

911
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:24,500
- Uh-oh!
- Are you stupid?

912
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:26,293
- You gettin' at my neck, boy?

913
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:28,795
What's this? What the fuck?

914
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:30,506
What are you gonna do,
little man?

915
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:33,133
Come on. Oh!
(chuckling): You fag!

916
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:35,636
Fuck! All right! All right.

917
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:37,971
Don't fucking kiss me,
you fucking fag!

918
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:40,641
(Angel laughing)
All right, dog. All right.

919
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:44,394
- Thank you.
- Yo, why don't we talk about your mom?

920
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:45,521
(laughing)

921
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:48,815
- My mom's a cunt.
When I get out, I'm moving out.

922
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:50,234
Don't worry about my mom.

923
00:58:50,401 --> 00:58:52,528
- Perfect,
because when I get out of here,

924
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:55,656
when you move,
I'm moving in.

925
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:58,075
Into your mama's ass.
(laughing)

926
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:00,327
- Shut up, man! Shut up!

927
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:02,204
- What are you actually gonna do
when you get out, man?

928
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:04,039
- Uh, I wanna join the circus.

929
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:06,208
- Oh, yeah? Join the circus.

930
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:08,335
Yeah, me too.
We'll all be in a clown costume.

931
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:10,170
- No, bro.
That's not funny, man.

932
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:11,713
I'm serious.
(Davis): Sure.

933
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:13,924
- My father was in the circus.

934
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:16,552
He died when I was 10, man.

935
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:20,597
He was doing a show
where he had to juggle some chainsaws,

936
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:22,391
kind of like what I'm doing right now.

937
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,309
But one of them fell out of his hand,

938
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:26,562
and as it fell down,
it cut his cock right off.

939
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:28,897
(both laughing)

940
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:36,071
- COs! COs!

941
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:44,371
- What are you guys doing?

942
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:48,292
- Laundry.
- You haven't even started your chores.

943
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:49,418
Well, on that happy note,

944
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,211
you're all drawing extra work duty
on Sunday.

945
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:52,963
(whispering): Fuck!

946
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:54,798
- Butch, follow me.

947
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:26,872
(knocking)

948
01:00:34,547 --> 01:00:35,839
- Sit down.

949
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:42,179
What's your plan, son?

950
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:43,847
- My plan?

951
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:46,767
- I mean after all this,
incarceration.

952
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:51,605
- Well, I want to study
at a circus school.

953
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:53,690
- Are you being sarcastic?

954
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:56,443
- Not at all.

955
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:57,861
- Hmm...

956
01:00:58,029 --> 01:01:00,572
The reason I'm asking you this
is because authorities

957
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:03,867
have investigated the officer
you blinded.

958
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:06,953
More than 10 parties of legal guardians
have complained

959
01:01:07,121 --> 01:01:10,207
that their children
were physically abused by this man.

960
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:13,835
I assume you acted in self-defense.

961
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:15,671
- To cut to the chase,
you have an opportunity here--

962
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:17,172
- No, no, no.

963
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:21,093
I took a careful look
at your report, son.

964
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:24,680
If that incident with this officer
hadn't occurred,

965
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:27,808
technically,
you'd be released this week.

966
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:31,019
- But in those next two weeks,
any misconduct on your part,

967
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:34,231
we withdraw the plea and it goes back
to the original charge,

968
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:35,357
which is, as you know,

969
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:39,152
four years in an adult facility
starting the day you turn 19.

970
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:41,154
- So with that in mind, son,

971
01:01:42,156 --> 01:01:44,241
I think you're responsible enough

972
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:47,244
to make the right choices inside,

973
01:01:47,995 --> 01:01:49,955
and then in the outside world...

974
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:52,541
hopefully,
in a circus school.

975
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:53,834
(warden chuckling)

976
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:56,962
Am I right?

977
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:01,341
- Yes, sir. Thank you.

978
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,387
- Good. You can go.

979
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:13,228
(door closing)

980
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:15,856
(all talking)

981
01:02:20,361 --> 01:02:22,612
- Where's my cheeseburger?

982
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:23,864
(slurping)

983
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:27,659
- Slow down, man.
You're gonna get some indigestion.

984
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:30,829
- You eating your nuggets?

985
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:33,749
- Yeah, I'm eating my nuggets.
I'm saving the best for last.

986
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:35,876
- Why the fuck would you do that?

987
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:40,630
- Eating's like making love, man.
It's a ritual, you know?

988
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:42,257
You got your appetizer,

989
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:44,509
I sniff deeply into her scalp

990
01:02:44,677 --> 01:02:47,554
and grab onto her firm,
but voluptuous hips,

991
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:49,681
nibble just ever so gently
on the earlobe.

992
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:51,433
I mean, girls,
they go wild for that.

993
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:54,519
- Why don't you skip the appetizer
and go straight to the main course?

994
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,021
- Well, what's the main course?

995
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:58,148
- Main course:
you bust a nut, she bounces,

996
01:02:58,316 --> 01:02:59,816
play some video games,

997
01:02:59,984 --> 01:03:02,736
do whatever the fuck you want
and then you go to sleep.

998
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:06,865
- You're an animal, you know that?
You disgust me.

999
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:09,201
For me, the entrée is,

1000
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:11,578
you know,
gentle circling the areola,

1001
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:14,080
kissing every notch of her spine,
lower and lower and lower

1002
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:16,500
until my tongue hovers
on her bellybutton.

1003
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:18,126
I take my time.

1004
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:20,921
- Yeah, you take so much time
that this girl's gonna be half asleep

1005
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:22,923
by the time you even get
to her cookie.

1006
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:25,801
Just like your food is getting all cold
and soggy now.

1007
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:27,761
And you don't know
what food tastes like,

1008
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:31,056
'cause you wolf that shit down
like you haven't eaten in days.

1009
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:32,933
Come on!
These are women.

1010
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:36,686
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Dude!

1011
01:03:36,854 --> 01:03:38,730
(spoon snapping)

1012
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:40,482
No, no, man!
That's my protein!

1013
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:41,817
- You're hungry?

1014
01:03:43,402 --> 01:03:44,903
- I can't even get that nugget.
It's disgusting.

1015
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:48,406
Rebound. Rebound. You like that?
(Angel): It was a rebound.

1016
01:03:49,867 --> 01:03:50,784
(laughing)

1017
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:52,869
(Davis, laughing): Butch!
Come on, man!

1018
01:03:53,037 --> 01:03:54,287
- That was awesome!

1019
01:03:54,455 --> 01:03:56,039
- You know how old this spinach is?

1020
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:58,792
It's like, six-month-old spinach
on my face.

1021
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,545
(Davis): That was a sweet move.
(Max): You're a jerk, you know that?

1022
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:02,712
- Oh!

1023
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:03,964
(Angel): Good job, bro.

1024
01:04:05,132 --> 01:04:06,424
- Oh! You like that?

1025
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,594
(Butch): I'm gonna kill you, man.
Don't do it again, please.

1026
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:30,031
(screams)

1027
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:35,579
(groaning)
- Look at us.

1028
01:04:35,746 --> 01:04:37,956
Look at us.
Okay, we need gloves for this.

1029
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:39,249
10-66...

1030
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:41,042
(CO): Did you see anyone?

1031
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:42,627
Did you see anyone?

1032
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:44,296
Anyone see what happened?

1033
01:04:44,463 --> 01:04:46,965
- Sit back down.
(gasping)

1034
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:51,136
- Nobody saw anything, huh?

1035
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:55,682
Simple.
Everyone's to blame.

1036
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:57,767
(clattering)

1037
01:04:57,935 --> 01:04:59,811
Greaves.

1038
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:02,022
What do you got?

1039
01:05:03,649 --> 01:05:06,735
- I haven't found anything so far.
- Okay.

1040
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:14,951
- All right, get back in there,

1041
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:16,745
clean up that mess
and make your beds.

1042
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,997
Lights go out in five. Move.

1043
01:05:24,712 --> 01:05:27,255
- That's okay.
You just have to explain.

1044
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:30,383
(sighing)

1045
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:33,053
Look, I gotta call you...
I'm... I gotta call you back.

1046
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:37,766
- The way we tossed the dorm
scared the hell out of them.

1047
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:39,643
I don't think we're gonna have
any further problems.

1048
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:40,894
- Let's hope so.

1049
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,104
- I'd like to also remind you

1050
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:45,106
that I've booked tomorrow off
for my daughter's party.

1051
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:46,816
- Out of the question.

1052
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:49,736
- My wife has been planning this
for months.

1053
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:51,112
- We've had five assaults this week.

1054
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,323
I got two COs down.
It's out of the question.

1055
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:55,533
- I got people flying in
from all over the place.

1056
01:05:55,701 --> 01:05:57,661
- Do I need to remind you
of your responsibilities

1057
01:05:57,828 --> 01:05:59,079
as a unit supervisor?

1058
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:03,375
- It's my kid's birthday.

1059
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:05,210
- These are your kids too.

1060
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:10,548
(man singing on radio, indistinct)

1061
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:34,197
(choking)

1062
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:37,242
(grunts)

1063
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:39,536
- This message was the final threat.

1064
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:40,870
(choking)

1065
01:06:41,038 --> 01:06:42,998
Don't ever do it again.

1066
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:47,210
(gasps)

1067
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:49,921
(gasping and coughing)

1068
01:06:53,384 --> 01:06:55,343
(coughing continues)

1069
01:06:58,097 --> 01:07:00,432
- Yeah, I put in for the shift change
two weeks ago.

1070
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:04,686
You know what?

1071
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:07,355
Sometimes I don't think you understand
what I do for a fucking living!

1072
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:09,441
(snickers)

1073
01:07:09,608 --> 01:07:11,026
Hold on.

1074
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:14,362
What are you looking at?
Get back to work!

1075
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:18,742
I can't talk about this now.

1076
01:07:18,909 --> 01:07:20,744
- Man, that fool is pussy-whipped.

1077
01:07:20,911 --> 01:07:23,121
He has no idea
how to talk to his woman.

1078
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:25,874
My girls would never talk to me
like that.

1079
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:27,208
(Butch scoffs)

1080
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:29,210
- You ain't got no fucking girls.

1081
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:30,795
- Don't get me started.
All right, man?

1082
01:07:30,963 --> 01:07:32,464
I am way out of your league.

1083
01:07:32,631 --> 01:07:35,800
- No, Melissa, I'm not the only one
ruining Grace's birthday

1084
01:07:35,968 --> 01:07:38,303
if they're in the room
while you're screaming at me.

1085
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:39,721
- Name one.

1086
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:41,139
- What, like, all of them?

1087
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:43,641
Shit! It would take me all day
just to get started.

1088
01:07:43,809 --> 01:07:44,726
- Just name one of them.

1089
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:47,562
- I'm not asking for a list.
Give me a single, solitary name.

1090
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:48,855
- Yeah.
- All right.

1091
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:51,232
- You don't got nothing, bro.
- I got... Okay, don't worry.

1092
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,567
- Nothing.

1093
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:55,487
- Listen, I'll give you one,
but you gotta keep it on the hush-hush.

1094
01:07:55,654 --> 01:07:56,946
- Just give us the name, man.

1095
01:07:57,114 --> 01:07:59,115
- All right, but I don't wanna get her
in trouble.

1096
01:07:59,283 --> 01:08:01,117
- I won't tell no one.
(all chuckling)

1097
01:08:01,285 --> 01:08:02,368
- You know Miss Biggs?

1098
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:05,914
- No.
(Davis): Oh, yeah.

1099
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:07,916
- What a whore.

1100
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:09,292
I knew something was up, though,

1101
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:11,544
'cause we haven't been connecting
in the same way.

1102
01:08:11,712 --> 01:08:14,881
- You know why it is? She doesn't like
that earlobe shit that you do.

1103
01:08:15,049 --> 01:08:17,133
- You're so full of shit!
You know that?

1104
01:08:17,301 --> 01:08:19,010
- Calm down!
It was just a one-time thing.

1105
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:21,846
I promise. I just had to do the job
for you once.

1106
01:08:22,014 --> 01:08:24,099
And now she's all yours.
It's good. It's good.

1107
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:25,850
(others chuckling)

1108
01:08:26,018 --> 01:08:28,353
- All right, you've seen her naked,
so what does she look like?

1109
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:30,021
(chuckling)

1110
01:08:30,189 --> 01:08:33,233
- She's got these perfect,
36D titties, all right?

1111
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:36,111
And then she's got
these firm love handles

1112
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:38,279
and then that big, flat ass,
you know, that's all right.

1113
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:40,740
But when you get it going,
it slaps and it claps together.

1114
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:41,866
It's beautiful.

1115
01:08:42,034 --> 01:08:43,910
- What about her labia?

1116
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:45,662
- She was definitely
on that old-school tip,

1117
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:48,540
you know, with the big bush,
but I still found her spot.

1118
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:51,835
I just had to machete my way
through her little tropical jungle

1119
01:08:52,002 --> 01:08:53,253
but it was there.

1120
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:56,965
(Butch): No doubt.
(Davis): Oh, it was beautiful. Tasty!

1121
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:59,467
(laughing)

1122
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:01,469
- It probably looks something like this.

1123
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:04,013
(Max laughing)

1124
01:09:04,181 --> 01:09:06,391
- Oh, ho, ho, man!
Yeah, that's her.

1125
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:09,269
(all talking)

1126
01:09:09,436 --> 01:09:11,312
- You know what, Melissa?
Fuck you too!

1127
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:12,981
(Davis): That's fucking good!

1128
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:14,107
(boys talking and laughing)

1129
01:09:14,275 --> 01:09:16,943
How wet is that pussy?
It's just dripping!

1130
01:09:17,111 --> 01:09:18,987
- Hey, what are you guys doing?

1131
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:20,572
(chuckling)

1132
01:09:20,739 --> 01:09:21,990
Line up, all of you!

1133
01:09:24,743 --> 01:09:26,119
Who drew that?

1134
01:09:28,747 --> 01:09:30,081
Who drew that?

1135
01:09:30,249 --> 01:09:31,499
(cell phone ringing)

1136
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:36,171
- I did.

1137
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:37,422
- Your phone's ringing.

1138
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:38,756
- Shut up!

1139
01:09:38,924 --> 01:09:40,800
- Why don't you answer it?

1140
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:43,178
- You did.

1141
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:44,721
(ringing)

1142
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:49,267
Let's take a closer look at your work.

1143
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:50,351
- Don't fucking touch me!

1144
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:53,104
- Let him go!
- Don't fucking touch me!

1145
01:09:53,647 --> 01:09:56,608
- Come on, chill!
(screaming)

1146
01:09:58,944 --> 01:10:00,445
(ringing)

1147
01:10:03,782 --> 01:10:04,991
- Yo, Angel.

1148
01:10:05,826 --> 01:10:08,203
Hey, bro.
Come on, man. Get up.

1149
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:12,415
Yo, Angel. Get up, man.

1150
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:14,667
What the...

1151
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:23,092
What the fuck did you do?

1152
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:24,260
(gate opening)

1153
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:26,012
What the fuck, man?

1154
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:28,389
(running footfalls)
What the fuck did you do?

1155
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:30,016
- On the ground now.

1156
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:32,769
What the hell happened?

1157
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:34,729
Goodyear,
what the hell happened?

1158
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:36,856
- Tell him what happened!

1159
01:10:37,024 --> 01:10:38,483
- On your belly!
- No!

1160
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:40,109
- On your belly.
Arms to the side.

1161
01:10:40,277 --> 01:10:42,737
- Tell him what happened!
What the fuck are you doing?

1162
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:45,365
Why don't you tell him
what happened, Goodyear?!

1163
01:10:45,532 --> 01:10:46,532
Fucking pussies!

1164
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:48,076
Tell him what fucking happened!

1165
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:50,662
- If I were you,
I'd be calling my union rep.

1166
01:10:50,829 --> 01:10:54,082
- We didn't fucking do anything!
(Sands): Where's that ammo?

1167
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:55,959
10-66, south main corridor now!

1168
01:10:56,126 --> 01:10:58,002
- Tell him what fucking happened!

1169
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:02,757
(continuous beeping)

1170
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:15,853
(many people shouting)

1171
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:20,316
(CO): Break it up right now!

1172
01:11:23,404 --> 01:11:25,238
Get away from there.

1173
01:11:26,323 --> 01:11:27,824
- What's up, bro?

1174
01:11:29,034 --> 01:11:30,493
- I'm back, kid.

1175
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:34,497
(continuous beeping)

1176
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:44,132

1177
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,009
(many people shouting)

1178
01:11:47,428 --> 01:11:49,262
(man on TV):
... with Steve Quailer.

1179
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:51,472
McCleod to Quailer.
And shot! Score!

1180
01:11:52,224 --> 01:11:53,266
- Yes!

1181
01:11:53,434 --> 01:11:55,435
(CO laughing)

1182
01:11:55,602 --> 01:11:58,146
(woman): You've reached
St. Patrick's Hospital.

1183
01:11:58,314 --> 01:11:59,647
Your call is important to us.

1184
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:02,608
A representative will be
with you shortly.

1185
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:05,403
We appreciate your patience.

1186
01:12:14,455 --> 01:12:16,164
- Get the fuck out of here.

1187
01:12:19,293 --> 01:12:22,253
(dryer clicks, rumbling)

1188
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:24,047
(washing machine running)

1189
01:12:28,385 --> 01:12:30,053
- No!
(groans)

1190
01:12:32,473 --> 01:12:34,015
No! No!

1191
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:35,266
Ah!

1192
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:36,726
(punches thudding)

1193
01:12:36,894 --> 01:12:38,603
(groaning)

1194
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:39,771
Ow!

1195
01:12:39,938 --> 01:12:41,189
(woman): Hello?

1196
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:43,107
- Yes...

1197
01:12:43,275 --> 01:12:45,443
I... I'm calling from Enola Vale
Youth Correctional.

1198
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:49,072
We had somebody admitted there
earlier this evening.

1199
01:12:49,239 --> 01:12:51,324
His name's Angel Ortiz.

1200
01:12:51,742 --> 01:12:54,118
- Well, Officer...
- Come on, man!

1201
01:12:54,286 --> 01:12:55,286
- We're sorry to inform you

1202
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:57,705
that the boy was pronounced dead
two hours ago.

1203
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:00,166
I'm very sorry.

1204
01:13:00,334 --> 01:13:01,667
(sighing)

1205
01:13:04,421 --> 01:13:06,381
(sighing)

1206
01:13:09,593 --> 01:13:11,260

1207
01:13:12,262 --> 01:13:14,055
(whimpers)

1208
01:13:21,313 --> 01:13:22,688
- Yo, what the fuck are you doing?

1209
01:13:22,856 --> 01:13:24,607
- Just fucking hold him.

1210
01:13:24,775 --> 01:13:26,609
(whimpering)

1211
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,738
- No! No!

1212
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:32,698
(gasps)

1213
01:13:32,866 --> 01:13:35,201

01:13:47,881 --> 01:13:50,466
(sobbing)

1217
01:13:51,677 --> 01:13:53,886
- Solitary Control.

1218
01:13:55,889 --> 01:13:57,348
Open up cell 9.

1219
01:13:58,559 --> 01:13:59,892

1220

(all talking)

1226
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:18,387
- Butch. Butch!

1227
01:15:26,730 --> 01:15:28,606
- What's up with Angel?

1228
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:30,358
- I don't know.
I didn't hear.

1229
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:31,943
I'm glad you're back, though.

1230
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:34,779
- Not for long.
I'll be out of this shithole in a week.

1231
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:36,656
- I have some...
Wait, wait.

1232
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:39,283
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm...

1233
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:25,121
(buzzing)

1234
01:16:26,164 --> 01:16:27,957
(buzzing)

1235
01:16:29,793 --> 01:16:31,586
- Who's ringing the bell?

1236
01:16:31,753 --> 01:16:34,255
- It's Davis.
I need to use the phone. Please.

1237
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:36,173
- Go back to bed.

1238
01:16:37,718 --> 01:16:41,470
- Give me the phone.
Let me use the phone, okay?

1239
01:16:42,389 --> 01:16:43,639
(Goodyear): Calm down.
He's coming.

1240
01:16:43,807 --> 01:16:46,017
(lock clicking, door opening)

1241
01:16:50,564 --> 01:16:53,357
- Davis, what's up, kid?
- I need to use the phone, man.

1242
01:16:53,525 --> 01:16:55,067
- Sorry, pal.
I can't let you out.

1243
01:16:55,235 --> 01:16:56,527
- Two minutes?

1244
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:58,654
- I can't.
I'll give in a word to Sands

1245
01:16:58,822 --> 01:17:00,489
and you can call
in the morning, okay?

1246
01:17:00,657 --> 01:17:01,824
- It has to be now.

1247
01:17:01,992 --> 01:17:04,368
- I understand
you're feeling a little homesick,

1248
01:17:04,536 --> 01:17:05,828
but it's 3:00 in the morning.

1249
01:17:08,373 --> 01:17:10,291
- I need to talk to my mother.

1250
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:11,500
- Okay.
- Please.

1251
01:17:11,668 --> 01:17:13,794
- Try and get some sleep,
and I promise tomorrow,

1252
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:15,463
everything's gonna be a lot better,
all right?

1253
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:17,798
- Please...
- Back to bed. Good night.

1254

- Hmm.

1269
01:20:52,973 --> 01:20:54,306
- Dead.

1270
01:20:57,686 --> 01:20:58,853
Dead.

1271
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:00,729

1276
01:21:09,155 --> 01:21:11,198

Now go to your left!

01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:14,720
- Get the fuck back there!

1292
01:22:16,097 --> 01:22:17,139
Fuck you!

1293
01:22:20,143 --> 01:22:21,602
(grunts)

1294
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:27,107

(screaming)

1296
01:22:37,577 --> 01:22:39,036
You fucker!

1297
01:23:03,311 --> 01:23:05,604

What the fuck are you doing?

How about you,
you motherfucker?

I want a permanent lockdown now.

1302
01:23:21,162 --> 01:23:23,622
I want you to neutralize this
in five minutes!

1303
01:23:23,790 --> 01:23:27,001

- Goodyear, there's no "we"!

1304
01:23:27,168 --> 01:23:29,461
I make the decisions around here!
You got that?

Butch.

1319
01:25:24,077 --> 01:25:25,702
Let's fucking go, man!

No, no!

Fuck! No!

Oh, fuck! No!

(Butch screaming in distance)

1334
01:26:54,626 --> 01:26:59,296
Blind and riding
on the ocean's spine

1335
01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:03,008
No fault of mine

1336
01:27:03,801 --> 01:27:06,220
Drowning is what I've perfected

For all my life
