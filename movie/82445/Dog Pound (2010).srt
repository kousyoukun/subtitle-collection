1
00:00:15,491 --> 00:00:35,493
 

2
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:39,038
Aw! Enough of that shit!

3
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,000
Shut the fuck up, bitch.

4
00:00:42,168 --> 00:00:44,002
Don't call me a bitch.

5
00:01:00,062 --> 00:01:01,521
You're so beautiful.

6
00:01:33,766 --> 00:01:36,100
Get out of your fucking room!
Turn it lower, for God's sake!

7
00:01:36,268 --> 00:01:38,102
Sorry, Mom!

8
00:02:14,477 --> 00:02:15,936
Are you all right, kid?

9
00:02:19,482 --> 00:02:21,733
You little fuck!

10
00:02:32,538 --> 00:02:35,708
- Did you make this?
- No.

11
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,336
Your cellmate told me
you made this.

12
00:02:39,504 --> 00:02:41,046
Don't hit me again.

13
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,303
Don't do that again, man!

14
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,180
- Are you threatening me, boy?
- I'm fucking threatening you, man!

15
00:02:49,348 --> 00:02:51,933
- Do you know where you are?
- Fucking right, bitch!

16
00:02:52,101 --> 00:02:54,228
Fuck you!
Don't do it again!

17
00:02:59,693 --> 00:03:02,945
I'm gonna come back in five
and you're gonna give me a name.

18
00:03:04,531 --> 00:03:05,866
And that's an order.

19
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,672
Fucking cunt!

20
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:22,216
Fuck you!

21
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:43,740
Gentlemen, strip out of
your civilian clothes

22
00:03:43,908 --> 00:03:46,743
and place all of your belongings
in the box with your name on it.

23
00:03:46,911 --> 00:03:49,455
We'll give back your shoes
once this search is complete.

24
00:03:49,623 --> 00:03:51,874
All of your belongings.

25
00:03:53,043 --> 00:03:54,210
Shake your hair.

26
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:57,046
Wiggle your fingers.

27
00:03:57,381 --> 00:03:58,757
Spread your toes.

28
00:03:59,675 --> 00:04:00,967
Blow your nose.

29
00:04:07,975 --> 00:04:09,602
Now turn around.

30
00:04:13,899 --> 00:04:15,108
Bend over.

31
00:04:18,028 --> 00:04:19,446
Cough.

32
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:21,990
Harder.

33
00:04:23,243 --> 00:04:24,243
Stand up.

34
00:04:26,246 --> 00:04:27,496
Turn around.

35
00:04:29,374 --> 00:04:31,292
Okay, boys,
now we'll get you dressed.

36
00:04:32,628 --> 00:04:35,255
Gentlemen, welcome to Enola Vale
Youth Correctional Facility.

37
00:04:35,423 --> 00:04:37,257
I'm your superintendent,
Mr. Sands.

38
00:04:37,425 --> 00:04:41,011
If you have any problems
or any questions during your stay here,

39
00:04:41,179 --> 00:04:43,139
you will report them
to your unit supervisor,

40
00:04:43,306 --> 00:04:44,974
in this case,
Officer Goodyear.

41
00:04:45,142 --> 00:04:47,017
He will then report it to me.

42
00:04:47,185 --> 00:04:49,979
As for school,
your re-socialization unit supervisor...

43
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:53,024
...basic rules around the place.

44
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:55,235
You better be listening.

45
00:04:55,403 --> 00:04:58,113
No weapons, no sharp items.

46
00:04:58,281 --> 00:05:00,198
No pornographic material,
no illegal substance,

47
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:02,660
no tobacco, no alcohol

48
00:05:02,828 --> 00:05:06,038
and no signs of gang activity
will be permitted

49
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:07,999
on the facility of Enola Vale.

50
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:10,042
Any questions?

51
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,461
Excellent.

52
00:05:16,801 --> 00:05:18,886
You're 30 minutes late again.
What's your excuse this time?

53
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:20,888
- Did I miss something?
- That's not the point.

54
00:05:21,055 --> 00:05:23,391
You're late and it's becoming
an ongoing habit.

55
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:25,977
- Were they prepped on the basics?
- I just did that.

56
00:05:26,145 --> 00:05:27,645
Good. Perfect timing.

57
00:05:28,564 --> 00:05:30,815
Well, what fresh hellions
are these?

58
00:05:33,987 --> 00:05:35,446
Angel.

59
00:05:38,867 --> 00:05:39,909
Davis.

60
00:05:40,076 --> 00:05:41,494
Guilty as charged.

61
00:05:41,661 --> 00:05:43,454
Yeah, well, do me a favor,
sunshine.

62
00:05:43,623 --> 00:05:44,664
Yank the pants up.

63
00:05:44,832 --> 00:05:46,541
There's no gangster wannabes
on my unit.

64
00:05:49,295 --> 00:05:50,462
Butch.

65
00:05:55,594 --> 00:05:57,845
Gentlemen,
pick up your belongings.

66
00:05:58,013 --> 00:05:59,096
Single file.

67
00:06:13,696 --> 00:06:15,532
Where are you two mutts
coming from?

68
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:18,284
We just finished
Social Studies class, Mr. G.

69
00:06:18,452 --> 00:06:20,161
- And where are you going?
- Going to the library.

70
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:21,746
I'm gone the weekend,
I come back,

71
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:23,706
and you're in Special Unit.
What happened?

72
00:06:23,874 --> 00:06:24,999
- Nothing.
- What you do?

73
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:26,335
I didn't do nothing.

74
00:06:26,503 --> 00:06:28,712
No, you didn't do anything.
And that makes sense.

75
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,423
They throw you in the hole
for two days for not doing nothing.

76
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:34,718
Why are you bothering him?
He told you he didn't do anything.

77
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:38,265
- What, are you his lawyer?
- No.

78
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:40,183
I'm a judge.

79
00:06:41,352 --> 00:06:43,979
- Pull your pants up and move on.
- All right, Mr. G.

80
00:06:44,146 --> 00:06:47,108
Like to see you out of that costume
by the end of the week too.

81
00:06:50,237 --> 00:06:51,237
Let's go.

82
00:07:00,748 --> 00:07:03,625
Butch, bed on the far left.
Davis, straight ahead.

83
00:07:03,793 --> 00:07:04,918
Angel, right here.

84
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,671
Stow your gear and come over here
and line up.

85
00:07:11,969 --> 00:07:14,053
Listen carefully.
This is a new day for you gentlemen.

86
00:07:14,847 --> 00:07:17,890
No one in here cares about any felonies
you may have committed in the past.

87
00:07:18,058 --> 00:07:19,852
The judge may have given you
a sentence,

88
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,354
but in reality, your sentence
all depends on your behavior.

89
00:07:22,522 --> 00:07:24,106
You show some good will
towards change

90
00:07:24,274 --> 00:07:26,650
and you get an earlier parole hearing
with the judge.

91
00:07:26,943 --> 00:07:28,611
Am I boring you, sunshine?

92
00:07:30,781 --> 00:07:32,073
No, sir.

93
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:33,199
Good.

94
00:07:33,367 --> 00:07:36,620
'Cause I read your report
and you should be listening the closest.

95
00:07:38,164 --> 00:07:39,748
Right now, you're all Level 1.

96
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,167
Evaluations will determine for us

97
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:44,003
whether you actually want to change
and rehabilitate.

98
00:07:45,464 --> 00:07:47,590
Show us some improvements
and you can move to Level 2

99
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,175
and become a trustee.

100
00:07:49,801 --> 00:07:50,761
You'll notice these gentlemen

101
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:53,221
by their sports black pants
and their polo shirts.

102
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:56,350
They've acknowledged they've made
some poor choices in life,

103
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,185
but they've proven to staff,

104
00:07:58,353 --> 00:07:59,895
and more importantly
to themselves,

105
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,607
that they're ready to re-enter society
with the necessary skills

106
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:05,401
to avoid further criminal behavior.

107
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,738
Becoming a trustee
comes with a lot of privileges.

108
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:10,531
But if you mess up,

109
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:14,703
if you try any crazy stuff
on anybody in here or yourself

110
00:08:15,372 --> 00:08:17,831
or you try to bust out,
well, congratulations.

111
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:21,251
You just won an orange suit
and a free trip to Special Unit.

112
00:08:24,215 --> 00:08:26,424
So, gentlemen,
make your stay pleasant here

113
00:08:26,592 --> 00:08:28,426
by being good to yourself,

114
00:08:28,928 --> 00:08:32,723
your peers and the staff,
and I guarantee you'll be all right.

115
00:08:34,184 --> 00:08:35,226
All right, unpack.

116
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,488
Good, boys.
Hot bowl of shit coming right up.

117
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:48,740
- You stinkin' like shit.
- No, I don't.

118
00:08:51,244 --> 00:08:52,994
Thanks, partner.

119
00:08:53,162 --> 00:08:56,082
Do some dishes
or something, Loony. Fuck!

120
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,750
Fuck your dishes!

121
00:08:59,128 --> 00:09:00,712
Loony, he thinks he's...

122
00:09:17,273 --> 00:09:18,440
No.

123
00:09:19,108 --> 00:09:21,109
Hurry up.
Keep it moving.

124
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:30,202
Is this seat taken?

125
00:09:40,757 --> 00:09:42,674
Somebody get clumsy
with the ladle?

126
00:09:44,886 --> 00:09:46,052
Don't move on it, man.

127
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,765
You'll just end up in the hole
where that asshole Banks wants you.

128
00:09:52,436 --> 00:09:53,478
The best thing...

129
00:09:54,897 --> 00:09:56,481
just pay no mind.

130
00:09:56,648 --> 00:09:58,692
Eventually, they'll
leave you alone like they did me.

131
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,198
I mean, that was also
because I have AIDS.

132
00:10:11,248 --> 00:10:13,500
You know, we all know
why you're in here,

133
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:14,918
especially Banks.

134
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,184
You like that one, huh?

135
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,020
It's pretty cool.

136
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,067
It's for all the virgins
I corrupted, man.

137
00:11:38,927 --> 00:11:40,845
Yo, drop it and flush it!

138
00:11:41,013 --> 00:11:42,305
Don't worry 'bout it.

139
00:11:44,392 --> 00:11:45,851
What the fuck?

140
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:48,395
- Throw me back my toothpaste, man.
- Fuck you! Get it yourself!

141
00:11:51,524 --> 00:11:53,275
Fucking prairie nigger.

142
00:11:54,361 --> 00:11:55,737
Sal!
- What?

143
00:11:55,905 --> 00:11:57,030
Come here.

144
00:11:57,197 --> 00:11:59,365
All right, gentlemen.
Let's settle down.

145
00:11:59,533 --> 00:12:01,326
Sal, get back in your bed.

146
00:12:04,331 --> 00:12:05,915
Good night, gentlemen.

147
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:12,904
- Hey, Goodyear.
- Morning. How was the night?

148
00:13:13,072 --> 00:13:14,280
No problems.

149
00:13:15,533 --> 00:13:18,452
Control, open gate B2, please.

150
00:13:21,456 --> 00:13:23,499
- Thank you, sir.
- Have a good day.

151
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:24,792
You too.

152
00:13:39,267 --> 00:13:41,644
Control, open dormitory A1.

153
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,316
Wakey, wakey!

154
00:13:47,484 --> 00:13:49,652
Hands off snaky! Let's go!

155
00:13:51,614 --> 00:13:52,531
Let's go, gentlemen.

156
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:54,950
A two-minute window
to get the bed made.

157
00:13:59,122 --> 00:14:00,832
Ends of the bed when you're done.

158
00:14:02,752 --> 00:14:04,377
Let's go, guys.
Shake it off.

159
00:14:25,234 --> 00:14:28,028
Mr. Angel Ortiz,
grab your bucket and mop.

160
00:14:28,196 --> 00:14:29,279
Come with me.

161
00:14:46,841 --> 00:14:48,175
He's right here.

162
00:14:59,146 --> 00:15:00,396
What's up, man?

163
00:15:02,358 --> 00:15:03,983
How's it going, man?

164
00:15:04,152 --> 00:15:05,277
What's up?

165
00:15:05,445 --> 00:15:07,196
You just get here?
Yeah.

166
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,322
Yeah, that's cool.

167
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,990
How much time did you get?

168
00:15:10,158 --> 00:15:11,992
- Three months, man.
- Oh!

169
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,994
- Just three?
- Just three.

170
00:15:14,162 --> 00:15:15,956
- Shit!
- That ain't shit, cuz.

171
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,083
You know, I just did
three months fucking three times.

172
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:21,545
I could do that on my fucking head
in the hole. You know what I mean?

173
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:24,798
Yeah. Yeah.
So how long you got, man?

174
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:27,635
What do you mean,
how long I got?

175
00:15:28,137 --> 00:15:30,054
Who the fuck's business is that, man?

176
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:32,223
Just asking, man.
I don't know.

177
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:35,184
Don't be asking no stupid
punk-ass questions around here.

178
00:15:35,895 --> 00:15:37,521
You'll go get yourself hurt, boy.

179
00:15:37,897 --> 00:15:39,148
Yeah, all right, man.

180
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,776
- You looking to get fucked up?
- No, man.

181
00:15:42,944 --> 00:15:44,319
- Looking to get fucked up?
- Relax, relax!

182
00:15:44,487 --> 00:15:46,029
Huh? Looking to get fucked up?

183
00:15:48,325 --> 00:15:50,994
Just fucking with you, man.
This nigger's a bitch, cuz.

184
00:15:52,163 --> 00:15:54,038
- No, man.
- Brush it off. Calm down, man.

185
00:15:55,124 --> 00:15:56,499
Your boots, though, man...

186
00:15:57,586 --> 00:15:59,461
They're looking, uh,
pretty nice, man.

187
00:16:00,338 --> 00:16:01,672
Where did you get those at?

188
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,257
- At the mall.
- At the mall?

189
00:16:03,425 --> 00:16:05,301
- Yeah.
- How much were they?

190
00:16:05,719 --> 00:16:07,846
They were, like,
I don't know, 100 bucks.

191
00:16:08,014 --> 00:16:10,765
Your mom give you those kicks
or something? A little present?

192
00:16:10,933 --> 00:16:12,017
- From mommy?
- No, man.

193
00:16:12,185 --> 00:16:13,185
No?

194
00:16:13,352 --> 00:16:15,353
- No, man. I bought these.
- You bought 'em?

195
00:16:15,521 --> 00:16:17,105
- Yeah.
- You a hustler, all right.

196
00:16:17,273 --> 00:16:18,274
Yeah.

197
00:16:18,567 --> 00:16:22,195
Fuck! Hustler hustlin'.
What size are you, 10? Big man?

198
00:16:22,362 --> 00:16:24,238
Let me check them boots out.
Cop 'em over.

199
00:16:24,406 --> 00:16:25,740
No, man. I'm only an 8.

200
00:16:25,908 --> 00:16:28,869
What the fuck you mean,
you is only an 8? Don't look like no 8!

201
00:16:29,037 --> 00:16:31,872
- You fucking lying to my boy?
- Don't look like a fucking 8 to me!

202
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,332
All right, man.

203
00:16:35,168 --> 00:16:36,793
Come on, man.
Don't be a bitch, man.

204
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:42,467
- They are nice-ass boots.
- Whoo-hee!

205
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:45,136
Yeah. I lookin' fresh to death.
You feeling me?

206
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,889
- Man, fresh as fuck.
- How am I looking, cuz?

207
00:16:48,057 --> 00:16:49,015
Nice. Nice, cuz.

208
00:16:49,183 --> 00:16:51,101
- How am I looking?
- They look good, man...

209
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:52,478
They're nice-ass boots.

210
00:16:52,646 --> 00:16:55,689
- Can I have it back now?
- Just feeling it out. They're comfy.

211
00:16:55,857 --> 00:16:57,775
- Let me see that other one.
- Try that shit.

212
00:17:00,696 --> 00:17:02,197
I'm gonna try that.

213
00:17:03,407 --> 00:17:05,325
It's all good, man.
It's all good. You feeling me?

214
00:17:05,493 --> 00:17:07,911
Fuck, they're real nice, bro,
but fuck, too big for me, man.

215
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,372
Let me check that.
Let me try both of them on at once.

216
00:17:10,539 --> 00:17:12,166
Now that they're on my feet,

217
00:17:12,334 --> 00:17:15,127
I don't really feel like
taking them off.

218
00:17:15,295 --> 00:17:17,463
They're too comfy. Plus, I'm fresh.
You know what I mean?

219
00:17:17,631 --> 00:17:20,091
Some boots right there,
they ain't tricking. They're nice.

220
00:17:20,259 --> 00:17:22,261
Don't take no offence,
you know what I mean?

221
00:17:22,428 --> 00:17:23,762
Let's peace-out of here, boys.

222
00:17:25,348 --> 00:17:26,723
Fucking bitch.

223
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,107
Fuck!

224
00:17:47,747 --> 00:17:49,164
Wake up.

225
00:17:49,332 --> 00:17:51,250
The floor's not gonna mop itself.

226
00:18:13,108 --> 00:18:14,526
Let's do it.

227
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:19,156
Faggot.

228
00:18:20,908 --> 00:18:22,117
Fucking bitch.

229
00:18:22,285 --> 00:18:24,328
You got him-
Butch!

230
00:18:24,495 --> 00:18:27,332
What did I just say to you?
Get back to work.

231
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,770
What's up, Shadow?

232
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,571
Wipe that smile off.

233
00:18:57,491 --> 00:18:59,575
That's it, boys.

234
00:18:59,743 --> 00:19:01,994
Let's get this shit cleaned up.

235
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,163
Loony.
Get the fuck up, man.

236
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,041
Get the fuck up.

237
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:53,843
Get the fuck up, man.

238
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:03,353
Loony. You go first.

239
00:20:23,793 --> 00:20:26,295
What the fuck you doing, man?
Not in the face, nigger!

240
00:20:26,463 --> 00:20:28,380
Shut up, man!

241
00:20:28,548 --> 00:20:31,175
I swear to God,
if you fucking rat, man,

242
00:20:31,342 --> 00:20:34,471
I'll kill you my fucking self, man.
You feel me?

243
00:21:01,792 --> 00:21:03,794
Time's up.
Get in front of your bunks.

244
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:05,171
Ready for inspection.

245
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:24,858
You call this making a bed?

246
00:21:25,861 --> 00:21:28,238
Whatever. Fuck.

247
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,701
Why the fuck did you do that?

248
00:21:34,745 --> 00:21:36,539
You better learn to control
your mouth, kid.

249
00:21:38,667 --> 00:21:40,376
I'm gonna mess it up tonight
anyways.

250
00:21:40,544 --> 00:21:41,585
Fuck, like...

251
00:21:41,753 --> 00:21:45,673
You are on solitary report
by supper.

252
00:21:46,467 --> 00:21:49,553
Now make your bed properly.

253
00:21:59,731 --> 00:22:01,774
Stand up straight, Frank.

254
00:22:10,743 --> 00:22:13,120
All right, boys.
Let's go. Wash up.

255
00:22:13,288 --> 00:22:16,081
Come on! Move it!

256
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:18,876
Let's go.

257
00:22:19,837 --> 00:22:21,045
You stay put.

258
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:29,638
That looks kind of painful.
Wanna tell me what happened?

259
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:32,850
I slipped and fell.

260
00:22:36,896 --> 00:22:38,856
Do I look like an asshole to you?

261
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,654
Well, fortunately for us,
we have some procedures in place.

262
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,907
You and I are gonna issue a report.

263
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,577
And what good would that do?

264
00:22:49,745 --> 00:22:53,205
I just told you I slipped
and fell in the dark.

265
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:55,374
- In the dark?
- Yeah.

266
00:22:55,751 --> 00:23:00,339
Well, maybe a few days in solitary,
you'll come up with a few more details.

267
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:01,715
Maybe.

268
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,510
Can I go?

269
00:23:06,638 --> 00:23:08,347
Yeah, you can go.

270
00:23:13,729 --> 00:23:15,521
Don't slip.

271
00:23:53,898 --> 00:23:57,526
- Fuck you, Banks!
- Banks, knock it off!

272
00:23:59,904 --> 00:24:02,322
Control, open gates B1.

273
00:24:25,057 --> 00:24:26,975
All right, I want two lines!

274
00:24:27,143 --> 00:24:29,310
Side by side in front of the dirt.
Line 'em up.

275
00:24:43,618 --> 00:24:44,660
Banks!

276
00:24:53,546 --> 00:24:56,006
How are you, son?
Sir, how are you?

277
00:24:56,174 --> 00:24:57,633
You doing a good job?

278
00:24:57,801 --> 00:24:59,969
I've been out of the dirt
for a while now.

279
00:25:00,137 --> 00:25:03,139
...an interview with construction
after this.

280
00:25:03,307 --> 00:25:04,807
Yeah, I'd like that.

281
00:25:10,648 --> 00:25:12,983
Aw!

282
00:25:18,407 --> 00:25:19,449
Max!

283
00:25:20,659 --> 00:25:22,410
Can you at least pretend
that you're working?

284
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,760
Kill it, Banks. Shut it down.

285
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:42,724
Lunch!

286
00:25:47,897 --> 00:25:50,024
Goodyear.
Move.

287
00:26:05,542 --> 00:26:06,834
Sit straight.

288
00:26:10,296 --> 00:26:12,799
You were transferred
to Enola Vale

289
00:26:12,967 --> 00:26:15,593
because you assaulted
a correctional officer.

290
00:26:16,428 --> 00:26:18,972
Not 24 hours inside,
you wake up all bruised up.

291
00:26:20,933 --> 00:26:24,979
I'm going to ask you for the last time:
what happened?

292
00:26:25,897 --> 00:26:27,940
I slipped and fell.

293
00:26:28,066 --> 00:26:30,109
Butch, I know you're not gonna rat,

294
00:26:30,277 --> 00:26:32,654
but our concern is
for your personal safety.

295
00:26:32,822 --> 00:26:35,699
Look, I am not your punishment.

296
00:26:37,326 --> 00:26:41,955
But if you refuse to cooperate,
I have no choice but to isolate you.

297
00:26:42,457 --> 00:26:43,457
Okay.

298
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,004
Goodyear, get him out of here.

299
00:27:01,311 --> 00:27:02,811
Come on in.

300
00:27:12,031 --> 00:27:13,949
Hurry up, Max.
I don't have all day.

301
00:27:15,035 --> 00:27:16,785
What's the rush,
Miss Biggs?

302
00:27:20,582 --> 00:27:23,167
So, what is it today, Max?
Is it about your HIV test?

303
00:27:23,335 --> 00:27:26,379
Don't worry, it's negative,
you can stop spreading those rumors.

304
00:27:29,008 --> 00:27:30,425
No, the truth is...

305
00:27:30,593 --> 00:27:33,803
I've fallen deeply in love
with a woman

306
00:27:33,971 --> 00:27:35,973
and I just...
I don't know how to tell her.

307
00:27:36,141 --> 00:27:37,683
Well, I can't help you with that.

308
00:27:37,851 --> 00:27:39,685
Maybe Sands can give you
some good advice.

309
00:27:40,228 --> 00:27:42,438
You know, I wanna tell her
so many things.

310
00:27:42,606 --> 00:27:44,190
I got so much inside,
I just wanna...

311
00:27:45,525 --> 00:27:46,902
I just...

312
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:49,112
You know, I wrote her a poem,
because, you know,

313
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,865
poetry is really the only way
I can truly express myself.

314
00:27:52,033 --> 00:27:53,116
Can I read it to you?

315
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,831
"She's a caretaker,

316
00:27:58,999 --> 00:28:02,085
"but there's no one
to take care of her.

317
00:28:03,087 --> 00:28:04,504
"She listens to others

318
00:28:04,672 --> 00:28:07,341
"to avoid listening to her. "

319
00:28:07,509 --> 00:28:09,426
That part doesn't rhyme.
It's just an early draft, though.

320
00:28:09,594 --> 00:28:12,513
"In a world surrounded by men,
I am her only admirer.

321
00:28:12,681 --> 00:28:14,014
"The clock is ticking,
she's getting older,

322
00:28:14,182 --> 00:28:15,808
"but still no rock on the finger-"

323
00:28:15,976 --> 00:28:17,519
Max, I get the point.

324
00:28:17,687 --> 00:28:19,980
I got a lot of work here.
I think you should go.

325
00:28:21,107 --> 00:28:23,942
Miss Biggs,
I am seriously offended here.

326
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:27,195
I don't know if you know this,
but when it comes to creativity,

327
00:28:27,363 --> 00:28:29,907
a subject us artists
are particularly sensitive to,

328
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:32,868
I'd really appreciate it
if you didn't interrupt me again.

329
00:28:35,205 --> 00:28:36,372
Fine.

330
00:28:38,208 --> 00:28:41,420
"I dream she's...

331
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:43,547
"lying naked on fur,
glistening crotch

332
00:28:43,715 --> 00:28:44,923
tickled by her pinkie finger. "

333
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:47,592
Enough Max!
Get out of here now!

334
00:28:48,803 --> 00:28:50,304
You don't get it.

335
00:28:50,472 --> 00:28:52,682
You crossed the line big time.
Get out now.

336
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:54,851
Since one of us
doesn't see the value in art,

337
00:28:55,019 --> 00:28:56,394
there won't be a next time.

338
00:29:08,116 --> 00:29:10,285
You probably thought
I was alluding to you in that poem.

339
00:29:10,453 --> 00:29:12,787
Uh, I wasn't,
so sorry to disappoint.

340
00:29:12,955 --> 00:29:14,289
And have a good day.

341
00:29:15,416 --> 00:29:16,875
Davis.

342
00:29:19,045 --> 00:29:21,172
You know, man,
when you first come here and shit,

343
00:29:21,339 --> 00:29:22,965
boys thought you was a bitch.

344
00:29:23,133 --> 00:29:24,967
At least you ain't rat
on nobody, man.

345
00:29:25,135 --> 00:29:26,802
So, you know, we're all straight?

346
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:29,722
- Cool.
- Everything's all right, man.

347
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:30,890
Thanks, man.

348
00:29:31,768 --> 00:29:35,312
What the fuck is it
you've got on going down there?

349
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,856
Pissin' sweat out your armpits, man!

350
00:29:38,024 --> 00:29:40,108
Yeah, man, I need to change
my shirt or some shit.

351
00:29:40,276 --> 00:29:41,610
What the fuck's wrong
with you, man?

352
00:29:41,778 --> 00:29:44,030
Why you always walking 'round here
all worried and shit, man?

353
00:29:44,198 --> 00:29:46,032
You ain't gotta be scared.
You scared?

354
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,535
- No, man. I'm not scared.
- You ain't got no reason to be scared.

355
00:29:49,703 --> 00:29:51,287
You know what I mean, player?

356
00:29:51,455 --> 00:29:52,873
- Yeah.
- Everything's all good.

357
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,291
Hustlers ain't scared of shit.

358
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,667
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

359
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:57,377
- You is a hustler, right?
- Yeah.

360
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:59,880
What you hustlin'?
So you hustlin' some weed and shit?

361
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,048
No, man. Pills and coke.

362
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,966
- You hustle that "yay"?
- Yeah.

363
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,386
Movin' that "yayo"?
You like that raw shit?

364
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:07,013
- Yeah.
- You like that shit?

365
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:08,556
Mm-hmm.

366
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:11,601
Yeah, so, uh, what if I had
some of that raw shit, man?

367
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:13,144
You want a bump?

368
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:15,022
What, you have some of that?

369
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,190
Yo, Loony.

370
00:30:16,358 --> 00:30:18,776
Get that white shit out
for the pretty boy, man.

371
00:30:18,944 --> 00:30:20,402
He wanna get fucked up.

372
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:22,154
All right. See you later.

373
00:30:22,322 --> 00:30:24,073
Hey, what the fuck
you doing in here?

374
00:30:24,241 --> 00:30:27,702
We're doing some big-man business.
Get the fuck out of here!

375
00:30:29,413 --> 00:30:32,124
Nice throw, you fucking faggot!
I'm gonna cut you up right now, bitch,

376
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:34,209
and all your little bitches
are gonna see.

377
00:30:34,377 --> 00:30:36,629
- Are you shitting me, Sal?
- Yo, fuck you!

378
00:30:39,758 --> 00:30:41,968
Suck on my nuts, mutt!

379
00:30:42,136 --> 00:30:44,011
You got that white shit
for me Loony?

380
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,353
Cut you a six, man.
Don't even worry about it.

381
00:30:55,483 --> 00:30:56,985
It's all straight.

382
00:30:59,321 --> 00:31:02,198
Get that into you, man.
That's some good.

383
00:31:04,326 --> 00:31:07,079
Oh, shit!

384
00:31:07,247 --> 00:31:08,873
How you like that, man?

385
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,833
Is that good shit?

386
00:31:11,001 --> 00:31:12,084
It's different.

387
00:31:12,252 --> 00:31:15,004
Yeah, that's just 'cause it's pure.
Don't worry about it.

388
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:40,699
Shhh! Just be quiet, man.
Shhh! Be quiet.

389
00:31:41,242 --> 00:31:43,035
- Yeah.
- Just be easy.

390
00:31:43,203 --> 00:31:45,078
Everything's okay, man.

391
00:31:45,246 --> 00:31:48,207
- Yeah.
- You're just tripping.

392
00:31:48,374 --> 00:31:50,251
- Yeah.
- It's all good.

393
00:31:50,419 --> 00:31:52,754
- Yeah.
- Shhh!

394
00:31:54,131 --> 00:31:55,673
You feel good, man.

395
00:31:55,841 --> 00:31:59,385
It is the best feeling ever, man.

396
00:31:59,971 --> 00:32:01,513
Deep into your hole, man.

397
00:32:03,016 --> 00:32:06,685
You feel so good.
You're gonna be fine.

398
00:32:06,853 --> 00:32:08,145
You love being fucked up.

399
00:32:08,313 --> 00:32:09,313
No.

400
00:32:13,486 --> 00:32:14,569
What?

401
00:32:14,737 --> 00:32:16,238
What you guys give me?

402
00:32:16,405 --> 00:32:17,322
Shhh!

403
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:19,157
Just some special medicine, man.

404
00:32:19,325 --> 00:32:21,953
Just the good medicine.

405
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,537
You love it, man.

406
00:32:23,705 --> 00:32:26,332
You feel good, dog.

407
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,043
Oh, look at these!

408
00:32:29,211 --> 00:32:30,670
That's the good shit, man.

409
00:32:30,837 --> 00:32:32,214
Don't wake up.

410
00:32:32,382 --> 00:32:34,174
Just go to sleep.

411
00:32:34,342 --> 00:32:37,177
Hey, is that your mom
and your sister in this photo?

412
00:32:37,887 --> 00:32:40,180
Damn, that bitch is fine!

413
00:32:40,556 --> 00:32:43,184
Tell that bitch to come see me
next visiting day, man.

414
00:32:43,352 --> 00:32:44,394
I'll beat that pussy up.

415
00:32:45,854 --> 00:32:48,815
Yeah, you know,
your mom was just here.

416
00:32:48,983 --> 00:32:49,899
Yeah, man.

417
00:32:50,067 --> 00:32:53,195
You know,
she left happier than she came.

418
00:32:53,363 --> 00:32:56,323
I'm so sad she left.
I miss her already.

419
00:32:57,117 --> 00:33:00,035
Yeah, you know,
she was sad when she was here.

420
00:33:00,203 --> 00:33:01,495
No.

421
00:33:01,663 --> 00:33:04,124
- She was looking for you.
- You missed her.

422
00:33:04,292 --> 00:33:06,042
But she found me.

423
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:09,087
- No!
- You know, she was so beautiful.

424
00:33:10,423 --> 00:33:12,090
She wants me.

425
00:33:13,635 --> 00:33:15,177
You know,
your mom loves me.

426
00:33:15,345 --> 00:33:16,387
No.

427
00:33:16,555 --> 00:33:19,307
Your mom calls me Daddy.
NO!

428
00:33:19,474 --> 00:33:21,684
Shut up, man.
Shut the fuck up.

429
00:33:21,852 --> 00:33:23,102
Where is she? Mom!

430
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:25,355
Shut up, man!
He's a fucking heat bag.

431
00:33:25,523 --> 00:33:27,399
Fuck it. Let's go.
Let's go, man.

432
00:33:27,567 --> 00:33:29,901
Fucking too much.

433
00:33:52,886 --> 00:33:54,386
Help...

434
00:33:56,932 --> 00:33:58,641
Help!

435
00:34:03,481 --> 00:34:04,481
Help!

436
00:34:08,195 --> 00:34:09,737
- Get on your feet, boy.
- I can't.

437
00:34:09,905 --> 00:34:11,864
- Come on, get up.
- No.

438
00:34:12,032 --> 00:34:13,324
Come on, boy.
Get on your feet.

439
00:34:14,576 --> 00:34:15,618
Come on.

440
00:34:18,581 --> 00:34:19,623
Come on.

441
00:34:31,387 --> 00:34:33,096
Stand here.
Don't move.

442
00:34:33,263 --> 00:34:35,264
Oh! Oh!

443
00:34:46,403 --> 00:34:47,528
Come here.

444
00:34:48,279 --> 00:34:49,280
Swallow.

445
00:35:16,185 --> 00:35:17,894
Solitary Control.

446
00:35:18,896 --> 00:35:20,355
Unlock 7.

447
00:35:28,866 --> 00:35:30,992
This is not a punishment.
It's for your own good.

448
00:35:31,161 --> 00:35:33,996
Try to drink lots of water
to flush that shit out of your system.

449
00:35:59,065 --> 00:36:03,236
I wait along the borders of disdain

450
00:36:06,073 --> 00:36:07,574
Staring in

451
00:36:07,742 --> 00:36:08,992
Open your mouth.

452
00:36:09,785 --> 00:36:10,994
What I would give

453
00:36:11,162 --> 00:36:13,915
To be within your arms

454
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,708
Thank you.

455
00:36:15,876 --> 00:36:18,169
Dry and warm

456
00:36:21,173 --> 00:36:23,841
- Where's the file, eh? Come on. Oh!
- Stop it.

457
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:26,345
- Where's those files that you stole?
- Stop it.

458
00:36:26,513 --> 00:36:30,557
Give me the scent of free

459
00:36:30,725 --> 00:36:34,186
Syringa tree

460
00:36:36,065 --> 00:36:38,650
It's final call

461
00:36:42,029 --> 00:36:45,491
Lonely voice upon a mountaintop

462
00:36:47,702 --> 00:36:49,495
Shouting out

463
00:36:52,582 --> 00:36:55,668
The secrets of a generation told

464
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:00,590
All the lies

465
00:37:04,011 --> 00:37:07,723
Blind and riding
on the ocean's spine

466
00:37:08,642 --> 00:37:10,059
No fault of mine

467
00:37:10,227 --> 00:37:11,394
Davis.

468
00:37:14,022 --> 00:37:17,568
Drowning is what I've perfected for

469
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,153
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

470
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,655
All my life

471
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,865
Hasty!

472
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,117
What happened here?

473
00:37:27,538 --> 00:37:28,496
Getting a little rough.

474
00:37:28,664 --> 00:37:30,540
No, man, I can't wait
to dig up ditches again tomorrow.

475
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:33,459
- I don't care.
- Should be a good time.

476
00:37:33,627 --> 00:37:35,837
- That's all he cares about.
- Wishful thoughts, eh?

477
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:39,842
Banks, let's go.
Good night, gentlemen.

478
00:37:45,807 --> 00:37:47,016
Give me

479
00:37:48,769 --> 00:37:51,104
The scent of free

480
00:37:51,272 --> 00:37:53,440
Syringa tree

481
00:37:54,317 --> 00:37:56,818
Crowning me

482
00:37:56,986 --> 00:37:58,403
My victory march

483
00:37:59,281 --> 00:38:01,866
The marble arch

484
00:38:02,034 --> 00:38:04,577
Trumpet horn

485
00:38:04,745 --> 00:38:07,038
It's final call

486
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,975
All right, boys.

487
00:38:26,143 --> 00:38:27,644
Go back to the dorms,

488
00:38:27,811 --> 00:38:29,979
wash up, change your clothes.

489
00:38:30,773 --> 00:38:32,399
Move out.

490
00:39:10,608 --> 00:39:12,025
Yo, faggot,
throw the ball back.

491
00:39:15,072 --> 00:39:17,115
Yo, I'm talking to you, faggot!

492
00:39:21,745 --> 00:39:23,371
Look, fuck you, man,
all right?

493
00:39:23,539 --> 00:39:25,082
What the fuck
did you just say to me?

494
00:39:26,126 --> 00:39:28,752
You want me to fuck you up,
faggot?

495
00:39:29,879 --> 00:39:32,047
Got your friend here.
What are you-

496
00:39:35,136 --> 00:39:36,553
Ow!

497
00:39:40,349 --> 00:39:42,726
You get the fuck back!
Where the fuck's Banks?

498
00:39:42,893 --> 00:39:44,477
- He's upstairs.
- Thank you.

499
00:39:44,645 --> 00:39:45,938
Let's go.

500
00:40:07,755 --> 00:40:08,755
Let's go.

501
00:40:19,476 --> 00:40:20,684
Keep watch.

502
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,186
All right.

503
00:40:59,937 --> 00:41:01,354
Davis!

504
00:41:03,941 --> 00:41:05,566
Get rid of it.

505
00:41:14,244 --> 00:41:16,662
-10-99, rec room.
What the hell happened here?

506
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:18,872
On your belly.
Arms by your side.

507
00:41:24,004 --> 00:41:25,213
Who did this to you?

508
00:41:31,596 --> 00:41:32,930
Who did this to him?

509
00:41:33,098 --> 00:41:34,557
Don't know.

510
00:41:40,689 --> 00:41:42,232
Sands to Control.

511
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:45,861
10-66, lavatory, dorm A.

512
00:41:47,613 --> 00:41:50,240
Get to the end of the bed,
both of you, now.

513
00:41:54,663 --> 00:41:55,872
What did I say to you?

514
00:41:56,915 --> 00:41:59,625
I said no retaliation,
you fucking moron!

515
00:41:59,793 --> 00:42:01,502
What are you talking about?

516
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:03,547
You really do think I'm stupid,
don't you?

517
00:42:03,715 --> 00:42:04,923
No, I don't.

518
00:42:05,091 --> 00:42:08,010
You think you're the first tough guy
to walk through these halls?

519
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:12,014
Think you're the first guy to ever lay
a beat down on somebody?

520
00:42:13,392 --> 00:42:14,726
Probably not.

521
00:42:14,894 --> 00:42:18,396
Well, I know I'm not your first CO,
so let's go, you and me.

522
00:42:21,775 --> 00:42:23,611
Yo, he didn't fucking do anything.
Chill!

523
00:42:23,778 --> 00:42:25,905
- Shut your mouth.
- Don't do that again.

524
00:42:26,072 --> 00:42:27,740
Don't do what again?

525
00:42:28,325 --> 00:42:30,993
- Don't fucking do that again.
- Come on, let's go.

526
00:42:33,914 --> 00:42:35,332
Come on. Throw down.

527
00:43:00,526 --> 00:43:02,235
Oh! Baby!

528
00:43:03,237 --> 00:43:05,489
Oh, my sweetie.
Okay, Mom.

529
00:43:12,331 --> 00:43:14,666
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

530
00:43:15,668 --> 00:43:18,921
- Are the kids still picking on you?
- No one's picking on me, Mom.

531
00:43:19,089 --> 00:43:21,131
I took care of that on my own,
all right?

532
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:24,927
Baby, I'm taking care of it.
I filed a suit against this institution.

533
00:43:25,095 --> 00:43:27,681
Why the fuck
would you do that, Mom?

534
00:43:29,141 --> 00:43:30,976
Baby, I called Uncle Conrad,

535
00:43:31,143 --> 00:43:33,436
and he has put me in touch
with a top lawyer.

536
00:43:35,523 --> 00:43:38,275
So what can I tell the lawyer?
When can he come and visit you?

537
00:43:38,443 --> 00:43:40,152
You can tell him to go fuck himself.

538
00:43:41,071 --> 00:43:42,196
Davis.

539
00:43:42,364 --> 00:43:43,948
I gotta go, Mom.

540
00:43:44,116 --> 00:43:45,783
No, sweetie.
Let me help you.

541
00:43:45,951 --> 00:43:47,159
No.

542
00:43:53,209 --> 00:43:54,835
Remove the hat, please.

543
00:44:18,111 --> 00:44:20,321
It's good.

544
00:44:21,198 --> 00:44:23,575
Ah! That's...

545
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:27,287
And your family is missing you, huh?

546
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:34,920
You keep on saying that.

547
00:44:35,088 --> 00:44:36,964
You keep on saying that.
Whatever.

548
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:38,966
You guys aren't doing anything, so...

549
00:44:58,238 --> 00:44:59,197
Boys!

550
00:45:19,178 --> 00:45:20,970
...they had the door unlocked.

551
00:45:21,138 --> 00:45:23,181
We opened it up
and it was just sitting there.

552
00:45:23,349 --> 00:45:25,768
It was just sitting there.

553
00:45:25,936 --> 00:45:28,270
It was just like... like...
Watch this right here.

554
00:45:28,438 --> 00:45:29,939
Just fucking sitting there...

555
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:39,825
- Hey, give me your bread!
- There's this special school...

556
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:14,279
Hey, yo, are you Butch?

557
00:46:15,531 --> 00:46:17,116
Who wants to know?

558
00:46:17,284 --> 00:46:19,535
This nigger Shadow
wants to talk to you.

559
00:46:20,537 --> 00:46:22,163
For what?

560
00:46:23,665 --> 00:46:25,249
Don't know.

561
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:39,891
Harrel, could you please
close the door?

562
00:46:49,402 --> 00:46:51,111
It's nice to see everyone here.

563
00:46:52,197 --> 00:46:54,323
Let's start by grading the day.

564
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:56,158
Who wants to go first?

565
00:46:59,622 --> 00:47:01,164
Okay, I'll go first.

566
00:47:01,332 --> 00:47:04,042
For me, today is a 6...

567
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:06,211
because this morning

568
00:47:06,378 --> 00:47:09,506
I lost my temper in traffic
with a jerk at a red light.

569
00:47:10,508 --> 00:47:12,009
Butch?

570
00:47:12,177 --> 00:47:14,970
- Seven.
- You wanna tell us why?

571
00:47:15,138 --> 00:47:17,181
Just got out
of the fucking hole today.

572
00:47:17,349 --> 00:47:20,560
- Good.
- Zero.

573
00:47:22,355 --> 00:47:24,064
Do you want to tell us why?

574
00:47:27,318 --> 00:47:28,693
No.

575
00:47:28,861 --> 00:47:31,405
Frank, you've been at zero now
for months.

576
00:47:31,573 --> 00:47:34,742
Is there nothing that's positive?

577
00:47:36,828 --> 00:47:38,037
No.

578
00:47:38,205 --> 00:47:40,958
Okay, we can talk
about that later.

579
00:47:42,418 --> 00:47:44,544
Harrel, can you read
what we're talking about today?

580
00:47:44,712 --> 00:47:49,299
"Evaluating and rel... re-label... "

581
00:47:52,513 --> 00:47:54,555
- Shut up, man.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

582
00:47:54,723 --> 00:47:56,057
I'll read it.

583
00:47:56,225 --> 00:47:57,767
"Anger and aggression. "

584
00:47:57,935 --> 00:48:01,437
I think we all realize
that everybody feels anger,

585
00:48:01,605 --> 00:48:04,400
but not everybody can control it,

586
00:48:04,567 --> 00:48:07,236
which is why
you guys are here today.

587
00:48:07,404 --> 00:48:11,407
So anger is a good thing
if you can control it,

588
00:48:11,574 --> 00:48:15,245
but it's a definite disadvantage
if you can't control it.

589
00:48:15,413 --> 00:48:18,331
So, let's start by talking
about what makes us angry.

590
00:48:18,499 --> 00:48:20,292
Harrel, what makes you angry?

591
00:48:20,459 --> 00:48:23,754
That I'm not next to you at night,
Miss Biggs.

592
00:48:23,922 --> 00:48:25,047
Harrel, that's enough.

593
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:28,175
What kind of ass-ugly nigger like you
would want to get a girl like her?

594
00:48:28,343 --> 00:48:29,927
Don't fucking call me no nigger!

595
00:48:30,095 --> 00:48:31,762
Thank you, gentlemen,
for going down.

596
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:34,182
- What's wrong with you?
- Frank, what about you?

597
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:35,892
What makes you angry?

598
00:48:36,894 --> 00:48:38,103
Fat people.

599
00:48:38,271 --> 00:48:41,148
They walk slowly in the middle
of the hallway.

600
00:48:41,316 --> 00:48:44,610
They're always sweating,
farting, funking up the dorm.

601
00:48:44,778 --> 00:48:47,530
Takes them an hour for them
to drop fat,

602
00:48:47,698 --> 00:48:49,449
anaconda shits
while I'm face-to-face with them

603
00:48:49,616 --> 00:48:52,535
trying to wash my face
or brush my motherfucking teeth.

604
00:48:52,703 --> 00:48:55,122
- That's a lot of f-words.
- Blame your mom.

605
00:48:56,916 --> 00:48:57,875
My mom?

606
00:48:58,043 --> 00:49:00,669
For giving you the big-ass nostrils
that look like sunglasses, son.

607
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:03,172
This is a good example of-

608
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:06,217
Every time we're talking,
you know what it really does?

609
00:49:06,385 --> 00:49:07,302
- What?
- It pisses me off.

610
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:09,512
One day, I'm gonna get up
and snap your neck.

611
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,640
- Move those lips so much.
- You wanna test me?

612
00:49:12,808 --> 00:49:14,309
- I'm right here!
- I'll break your neck.

613
00:49:14,477 --> 00:49:17,229
This is really-
You ain't making no moves.

614
00:49:17,397 --> 00:49:19,148
That's nothing. I'll show you.

615
00:49:19,316 --> 00:49:20,858
Sit!

616
00:49:21,026 --> 00:49:21,984
Boys, that's enough.

617
00:49:22,152 --> 00:49:24,987
- You wanna fucking do this?
- Frank, that's enough.

618
00:49:25,155 --> 00:49:27,157
- What are you gonna do?
- No touching! Break it up.

619
00:49:27,325 --> 00:49:29,868
Break it up!

620
00:49:30,036 --> 00:49:32,162
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Right now!

621
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:33,663
Let's do this!
I'm right here!

622
00:49:33,831 --> 00:49:35,082
You wanna go?

623
00:49:35,249 --> 00:49:37,377
You wanna go?
Let's go!

624
00:49:37,544 --> 00:49:39,504
Emergency A-23.
Send me a CO now.

625
00:49:43,258 --> 00:49:45,426
I'll, uh... I'll come and see you
after the family visits.

626
00:49:45,594 --> 00:49:47,178
Okay, bro?

627
00:49:47,346 --> 00:49:48,472
Settle down!

628
00:49:51,518 --> 00:49:53,811
- Get off him!
- Stop it!

629
00:49:53,978 --> 00:49:55,354
Let go!

630
00:49:56,272 --> 00:49:59,109
- You want some, huh?
- Frank!

631
00:50:00,611 --> 00:50:01,861
Okay, take him!

632
00:50:02,029 --> 00:50:03,655
I got you, baby!

633
00:50:03,823 --> 00:50:06,032
You are done!
You hear that?

634
00:50:15,502 --> 00:50:18,129
Here. I gotta go.
The CO's waiting for me upstairs.

635
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:21,049
Let me see the other guy's cut.

636
00:50:21,217 --> 00:50:22,551
What?

637
00:50:22,718 --> 00:50:24,553
Let me see the other guy's cut.

638
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:27,347
Oh, here we go!

639
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:32,562
Shadow paid for that.
He's expecting it.

640
00:50:32,729 --> 00:50:34,730
Turn around
and spread your legs.

641
00:50:34,898 --> 00:50:38,067
- There's a fucking CO waiting-
- Turn around and spread your legs.

642
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:41,321
That's not how it works.

643
00:50:48,621 --> 00:50:50,956
I don't like sneaky people
doing sneaky shit behind my back.

644
00:50:51,124 --> 00:50:53,418
Don't know what you're talking about,
but we have a system here.

645
00:50:53,586 --> 00:50:56,546
Fuck your system.
Today is my way.

646
00:51:19,405 --> 00:51:20,947
What the hell?

647
00:51:21,908 --> 00:51:23,910
Fuck off with that shit, man!

648
00:51:24,077 --> 00:51:25,453
Fuck!

649
00:51:25,621 --> 00:51:27,288
Or tell us what you're thinkin'.

650
00:51:27,456 --> 00:51:29,123
Shit, man!
You just ruined it.

651
00:51:31,126 --> 00:51:33,294
- Tell us one of your lady stories, B.
- Good idea!

652
00:51:33,462 --> 00:51:35,005
Yeah, boy!
Yeah, yeah!

653
00:51:35,173 --> 00:51:38,509
- Yeah, man!
- Oh! All right.

654
00:51:38,676 --> 00:51:39,927
Make it good.

655
00:51:40,094 --> 00:51:42,471
So I'm sleeping over
at my girl's house, right?

656
00:51:42,931 --> 00:51:45,767
And she's on the rag,
so she just wants to go to sleep.

657
00:51:45,935 --> 00:51:48,019
I got the worst case
of blue balls, all right?

658
00:51:49,647 --> 00:51:51,689
Fuck that bitch, dog.
Fuck that bitch!

659
00:51:54,527 --> 00:51:57,404
So I... I just go downstairs
to the living room.

660
00:51:57,572 --> 00:51:58,989
I'm in my boxers.

661
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:02,326
And chilling out, throw on the TV
and I just light up a "J".

662
00:52:07,959 --> 00:52:10,710
But then the front door opens.

663
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:12,837
And who walks in?

664
00:52:13,005 --> 00:52:14,297
Her fucking mom!

665
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:16,008
I think she's gonna
either bitch me out

666
00:52:16,176 --> 00:52:18,761
or make some small talk
and go off to bed, but no.

667
00:52:18,929 --> 00:52:20,680
She takes off her jacket.

668
00:52:20,847 --> 00:52:24,725
She's wearing this dress that makes
her titties just pop right out.

669
00:52:24,893 --> 00:52:27,688
And then she comes
and she sits right next to me.

670
00:52:28,356 --> 00:52:32,067
I don't know what the hell to say,
so I'm just trying to watch TV.

671
00:52:32,235 --> 00:52:35,571
But I could see out of the corner
of my eye that's she's looking at me.

672
00:52:35,738 --> 00:52:38,825
And then she says:
"Can I get a drag of that?"

673
00:52:40,286 --> 00:52:41,619
And I'm like: "Sure".

674
00:52:41,787 --> 00:52:43,913
So I'm watching her smoke this thing,

675
00:52:44,081 --> 00:52:46,124
and she's got these big,
juicy lips,

676
00:52:46,292 --> 00:52:48,627
and she's getting red lipstick
all over the tip of it.

677
00:52:48,795 --> 00:52:52,548
And she's blowing smoke in my face,
and I'm trying to concentrate on TV.

678
00:52:52,716 --> 00:52:54,258
But when she gives the spliff back,

679
00:52:54,426 --> 00:52:57,511
some ash falls right on my boxers.

680
00:52:57,679 --> 00:52:59,139
And before I can even do anything,

681
00:52:59,307 --> 00:53:03,310
she bends over and blows the ash off
with her mouth.

682
00:53:03,477 --> 00:53:05,395
And the bitch just sits back and says:

683
00:53:05,563 --> 00:53:07,480
"I'm gonna go to bed now. "

684
00:53:07,648 --> 00:53:10,568
I'm watching her go,
and before she gets to the doorway,

685
00:53:10,736 --> 00:53:13,446
she turns back and says:
"Good night, Davis. "

686
00:53:15,157 --> 00:53:17,742
You want that bitch!
You want that, white boy!

687
00:53:19,912 --> 00:53:22,497
So, what the fuck would you do?
What would you do?

688
00:53:22,665 --> 00:53:24,499
I knew I had to do something, right?

689
00:53:24,667 --> 00:53:26,501
I'm not a fucking idiot.
So I start...

690
00:53:26,669 --> 00:53:29,171
I start sneaking up the stairs
really slowly.

691
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:32,050
And I walk into her room
really, really slowly.

692
00:53:32,217 --> 00:53:33,343
She can't hear me.

693
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:35,303
And when I get there,

694
00:53:35,471 --> 00:53:37,555
she's just combing her hair
in her vanity mirror.

695
00:53:37,723 --> 00:53:40,934
And she's just, like,
looking all sultry, all sexy.

696
00:53:41,102 --> 00:53:43,562
And then when she notices me
standing there,

697
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:44,897
what does she say?

698
00:53:46,274 --> 00:53:48,275
"Would you help me
with my zipper?"

699
00:53:53,699 --> 00:53:55,033
Mommy's naughty!

700
00:53:55,201 --> 00:53:57,702
- Damn, son!
- So now I'm fucking...

701
00:53:57,870 --> 00:54:00,080
Now I'm standing behind her, right?

702
00:54:00,247 --> 00:54:03,292
I'm standing behind her,
unzipping her dress,

703
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:06,128
and she starts leaning forward
towards the mirror

704
00:54:06,296 --> 00:54:07,630
so she could see her face
closer in the mirror.

705
00:54:07,798 --> 00:54:11,175
And that means that her ass
is back up against my dick,

706
00:54:11,343 --> 00:54:12,552
like, brushing against me.

707
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,681
And I don't know what the fuck
goes through my head,

708
00:54:15,848 --> 00:54:18,809
but I slap her ass and then I go:

709
00:54:18,976 --> 00:54:21,311
Lay back on the bed, bitch,
and open your legs.

710
00:54:21,479 --> 00:54:23,398
"What the fuck did you just say?"

711
00:54:23,565 --> 00:54:25,692
And then she grabs me
by the throat,

712
00:54:25,859 --> 00:54:27,485
throws me down
on that fucking bed,

713
00:54:27,653 --> 00:54:30,488
jumps on me
and starts sucking on my face, man.

714
00:54:32,491 --> 00:54:34,368
Yeah! Yeah!

715
00:54:35,578 --> 00:54:36,704
That's my boy!

716
00:54:44,338 --> 00:54:45,630
Whoa!

717
00:54:55,767 --> 00:54:59,770
Good morning, ladies!
Gather round the middle.

718
00:55:07,071 --> 00:55:08,989
Let's see how your team spirit
is this morning.

719
00:55:09,157 --> 00:55:11,158
We're gonna play a game
called dodge ball.

720
00:55:11,325 --> 00:55:13,368
Now mix up into two teams.

721
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:37,812
We're not gonna have
any of this bullshit

722
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:39,355
on my court this morning.

723
00:55:40,399 --> 00:55:42,650
You ain't no wiggers,
no niggers, no fucking crackers.

724
00:55:42,818 --> 00:55:44,944
I don't give a shit
what you think you is.

725
00:55:45,112 --> 00:55:48,657
You're a bunch of stray dogs
that got locked up in this dog pound

726
00:55:49,659 --> 00:55:50,951
and you all stink the same!

727
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:52,703
Now mix this shit up!

728
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:58,251
Sweat Marks,
get your ass over there now.

729
00:56:00,046 --> 00:56:03,173
Anybody else want my foot in their ass?
Now mix this shit up!

730
00:56:10,849 --> 00:56:12,725
My rules are simple.

731
00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:14,852
Strike your opponent with the ball.

732
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:16,813
Dodge it, catch it

733
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:19,483
and do not step on the line
or your team loses.

734
00:56:20,276 --> 00:56:21,610
Ready?

735
00:56:24,989 --> 00:56:27,574
On your mark... set...

736
00:56:37,002 --> 00:56:38,378
You're out!

737
00:56:40,256 --> 00:56:41,257
Come on!

738
00:56:43,969 --> 00:56:45,427
You're out, big boy!

739
00:56:46,972 --> 00:56:49,306
Come on, man. You're gone.

740
00:56:55,857 --> 00:56:58,400
This is your time
to get your aggression out.

741
00:56:58,568 --> 00:57:00,235
Now, brother!

742
00:57:00,403 --> 00:57:01,946
You're out! You're out.

743
00:57:02,739 --> 00:57:04,574
Let's go! Come on!

744
00:57:05,868 --> 00:57:07,827
- Come on!
- Get him!

745
00:57:07,995 --> 00:57:09,996
Come on!
Come on, take him out!

746
00:57:11,081 --> 00:57:12,165
Sweat Marks!

747
00:57:12,333 --> 00:57:14,001
Yeah, Sweat Marks!

748
00:57:14,168 --> 00:57:17,504
Sweat Marks! Sweat Marks!

749
00:57:17,672 --> 00:57:18,881
Oh!

750
00:57:19,048 --> 00:57:20,924
Sweat Marks!
Sweat Marks!

751
00:57:21,092 --> 00:57:22,259
One more!

752
00:57:22,427 --> 00:57:24,220
Sweat Marks!
Sweat Marks!

753
00:57:39,946 --> 00:57:42,197
Yeah!
You're my bitch now!

754
00:57:42,365 --> 00:57:44,367
Oh, shit!

755
00:57:46,037 --> 00:57:47,245
Yo, man,
what's in there?

756
00:57:47,413 --> 00:57:50,582
Sour OJ,
bread and a lot of sugar.

757
00:57:50,875 --> 00:57:53,001
Angel, was that your dad
that came to visit today?

758
00:57:53,169 --> 00:57:54,377
Yep.

759
00:57:54,546 --> 00:57:56,130
When's your mom gonna come?

760
00:57:58,258 --> 00:58:00,927
Man, I'll fucking slit your throat
if you go there.

761
00:58:01,094 --> 00:58:02,053
- What?
- Seriously.

762
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:04,722
When's you mom gonna come.
Is she cute?

763
00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:06,642
I don't know, fuck.

764
00:58:06,809 --> 00:58:08,769
You can tell if a woman's pretty
even if it's your mom.

765
00:58:08,937 --> 00:58:11,229
- I dunno.
- Is she an attractive woman?

766
00:58:11,397 --> 00:58:12,439
She's my mom, man!

767
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:15,233
Would you have sex with her
if you were not her son?

768
00:58:17,029 --> 00:58:18,947
- Uh-oh!
- Are you stupid?

769
00:58:19,114 --> 00:58:20,740
You gettin' at my neck, boy?

770
00:58:21,742 --> 00:58:23,242
What's this? What the fuck?

771
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:24,953
What are you gonna do,
little man?

772
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:27,581
Come on. Oh!
You fag!

773
00:58:27,832 --> 00:58:30,084
Fuck! All right! All right.

774
00:58:31,086 --> 00:58:32,419
Don't fucking kiss me,
you fucking fag!

775
00:58:32,587 --> 00:58:35,089
All right, dog. All right.

776
00:58:36,466 --> 00:58:38,843
- Thank you.
- Yo, why don't we talk about your mom?

777
00:58:40,137 --> 00:58:43,264
My mom's a cunt.
When I get out, I'm moving out.

778
00:58:43,432 --> 00:58:44,683
Don't worry about my mom.

779
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:46,977
Perfect,
because when I get out of here,

780
00:58:47,938 --> 00:58:50,106
when you move,
I'm moving in.

781
00:58:50,524 --> 00:58:52,525
Into your mama's ass.

782
00:58:52,693 --> 00:58:54,777
Shut up, man! Shut up!

783
00:58:54,945 --> 00:58:56,654
What are you actually gonna do
when you get out, man?

784
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,490
Uh, I wanna join the circus.

785
00:58:58,658 --> 00:59:00,659
Oh, yeah? Join the circus.

786
00:59:00,827 --> 00:59:02,786
Yeah, me too.
We'll all be in a clown costume.

787
00:59:02,954 --> 00:59:04,621
No, bro.
That's not funny, man.

788
00:59:04,789 --> 00:59:06,164
I'm serious.
Sure.

789
00:59:06,916 --> 00:59:08,375
My father was in the circus.

790
00:59:09,378 --> 00:59:11,004
He died when I was 10, man.

791
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:15,049
He was doing a show
where he had to juggle some chainsaws,

792
00:59:15,217 --> 00:59:16,843
kind of like what I'm doing right now.

793
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:18,761
But one of them fell out of his hand,

794
00:59:18,929 --> 00:59:21,015
and as it fell down,
it cut his cock right off.

795
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:30,525
COs! COs!

796
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:38,825
What are you guys doing?

797
00:59:40,579 --> 00:59:42,747
- Laundry.
- You haven't even started your chores.

798
00:59:42,914 --> 00:59:43,873
Well, on that happy note,

799
00:59:44,041 --> 00:59:45,666
you're all drawing extra work duty
on Sunday.

800
00:59:45,834 --> 00:59:47,418
Fuck!

801
00:59:47,586 --> 00:59:49,253
Butch, follow me.

802
01:00:29,006 --> 01:00:30,298
Sit down.

803
01:00:34,471 --> 01:00:36,639
What's your plan, son?

804
01:00:36,807 --> 01:00:38,307
My plan?

805
01:00:38,475 --> 01:00:41,227
I mean after all this,
incarceration.

806
01:00:43,856 --> 01:00:46,066
Well, I want to study
at a circus school.

807
01:00:46,234 --> 01:00:48,151
Are you being sarcastic?

808
01:00:49,487 --> 01:00:50,904
Not at all.

809
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,322
Hmm...

810
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:55,034
The reason I'm asking you this
is because authorities

811
01:00:55,202 --> 01:00:58,329
have investigated the officer
you blinded.

812
01:00:58,539 --> 01:01:01,415
More than 10 parties of legal guardians
have complained

813
01:01:01,583 --> 01:01:04,669
that their children
were physically abused by this man.

814
01:01:05,672 --> 01:01:08,298
I assume you acted in self-defense.

815
01:01:08,466 --> 01:01:10,134
To cut to the chase,
you have an opportunity here-

816
01:01:10,301 --> 01:01:11,635
No, no, no.

817
01:01:13,138 --> 01:01:15,557
I took a careful look
at your report, son.

818
01:01:16,267 --> 01:01:19,144
If that incident with this officer
hadn't occurred,

819
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:22,272
technically,
you'd be released this week.

820
01:01:22,439 --> 01:01:25,483
But in those next two weeks,
any misconduct on your part,

821
01:01:25,651 --> 01:01:28,696
we withdraw the plea and it goes back
to the original charge,

822
01:01:28,864 --> 01:01:29,822
which is, as you know,

823
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:33,617
four years in an adult facility
starting the day you turn 19.

824
01:01:33,785 --> 01:01:35,619
So with that in mind, son,

825
01:01:36,622 --> 01:01:38,707
I think you're responsible enough

826
01:01:38,875 --> 01:01:41,710
to make the right choices inside,

827
01:01:42,461 --> 01:01:44,421
and then in the outside world...

828
01:01:45,381 --> 01:01:47,007
hopefully,
in a circus school.

829
01:01:49,761 --> 01:01:51,429
Am I right?

830
01:01:53,891 --> 01:01:55,808
Yes, sir. Thank you.

831
01:01:57,227 --> 01:01:59,855
Good. You can go.

832
01:02:14,830 --> 01:02:17,081
Where's my cheeseburger?

833
01:02:20,337 --> 01:02:22,129
Slow down, man.
You're gonna get some indigestion.

834
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:25,299
You eating your nuggets?

835
01:02:25,467 --> 01:02:28,219
Yeah, I'm eating my nuggets.
I'm saving the best for last.

836
01:02:29,095 --> 01:02:30,347
Why the fuck would you do that?

837
01:02:32,099 --> 01:02:35,101
Eating's like making love, man.
It's a ritual, you know?

838
01:02:35,269 --> 01:02:36,728
You got your appetizer,

839
01:02:36,896 --> 01:02:38,980
I sniff deeply into her scalp

840
01:02:39,148 --> 01:02:42,026
and grab onto her firm,
but voluptuous hips,

841
01:02:42,194 --> 01:02:44,153
nibble just ever so gently
on the earlobe.

842
01:02:44,321 --> 01:02:45,905
I mean, girls,
they go wild for that.

843
01:02:46,073 --> 01:02:48,991
Why don't you skip the appetizer
and go straight to the main course?

844
01:02:49,409 --> 01:02:50,493
Well, what's the main course?

845
01:02:50,662 --> 01:02:52,621
Main course:
you bust a nut, she bounces,

846
01:02:52,789 --> 01:02:54,289
play some video games,

847
01:02:54,457 --> 01:02:57,209
do whatever the fuck you want
and then you go to sleep.

848
01:02:58,670 --> 01:03:01,339
You're an animal, you know that?
You disgust me.

849
01:03:01,507 --> 01:03:03,675
For me, the entrée is,

850
01:03:03,842 --> 01:03:06,052
you know,
gentle circling the areola,

851
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:08,554
kissing every notch of her spine,
lower and lower and lower

852
01:03:08,722 --> 01:03:10,974
until my tongue hovers
on her bellybutton.

853
01:03:11,141 --> 01:03:12,601
I take my time.

854
01:03:12,769 --> 01:03:15,396
Yeah, you take so much time
that this girl's gonna be half asleep

855
01:03:15,563 --> 01:03:17,398
by the time you even get
to her cookie.

856
01:03:17,565 --> 01:03:20,276
Just like your food is getting all cold
and soggy now.

857
01:03:20,443 --> 01:03:22,236
And you don't know
what food tastes like,

858
01:03:22,405 --> 01:03:25,532
'cause you wolf that shit down
like you haven't eaten in days.

859
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:27,409
Come on!
These are women.

860
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:31,162
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Dude!

861
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,959
No, no, man!
That's my protein!

862
01:03:35,127 --> 01:03:36,294
You're hungry?

863
01:03:37,879 --> 01:03:39,380
I can't even get that nugget.
It's disgusting.

864
01:03:40,507 --> 01:03:42,883
Rebound. Rebound. You like that?
It was a rebound.

865
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:47,347
Butch!
Come on, man!

866
01:03:47,515 --> 01:03:48,765
That was awesome!

867
01:03:48,933 --> 01:03:50,517
You know how old this spinach is?

868
01:03:50,685 --> 01:03:53,270
It's like, six-month-old spinach
on my face.

869
01:03:53,438 --> 01:03:56,024
That was a sweet move.
You're a jerk, you know that?

870
01:03:56,191 --> 01:03:57,191
Oh!

871
01:03:57,359 --> 01:03:58,443
Good job, bro.

872
01:03:59,611 --> 01:04:00,903
Oh! You like that?

873
01:04:01,989 --> 01:04:04,073
I'm gonna kill you, man.
Don't do it again, please.

874
01:04:28,018 --> 01:04:30,061
Look at us.

875
01:04:30,228 --> 01:04:32,438
Look at us.
Okay, we need gloves for this.

876
01:04:32,606 --> 01:04:33,731
10-66...

877
01:04:33,899 --> 01:04:35,524
Did you see anyone?

878
01:04:35,692 --> 01:04:37,110
Did you see anyone?

879
01:04:37,779 --> 01:04:38,779
Anyone see what happened?

880
01:04:38,946 --> 01:04:41,448
Sit back down.

881
01:04:43,701 --> 01:04:45,619
Nobody saw anything, huh?

882
01:04:47,081 --> 01:04:50,166
Simple.
Everyone's to blame.

883
01:04:52,419 --> 01:04:54,295
Greaves.

884
01:04:54,463 --> 01:04:56,506
What do you got?

885
01:04:58,134 --> 01:05:01,220
- I haven't found anything so far.
- Okay.

886
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:09,437
All right, get back in there,

887
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:11,231
clean up that mess
and make your beds.

888
01:05:11,399 --> 01:05:13,483
Lights go out in five. Move.

889
01:05:19,199 --> 01:05:21,742
That's okay.
You just have to explain.

890
01:05:25,038 --> 01:05:27,540
Look, I gotta call you...
I'm... I gotta call you back.

891
01:05:29,919 --> 01:05:32,254
The way we tossed the dorm
scared the hell out of them.

892
01:05:32,422 --> 01:05:34,131
I don't think we're gonna have
any further problems.

893
01:05:34,298 --> 01:05:35,382
Let's hope so.

894
01:05:36,426 --> 01:05:37,592
I'd like to also remind you

895
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:39,594
that I've booked tomorrow off
for my daughter's party.

896
01:05:39,762 --> 01:05:41,305
Out of the question.

897
01:05:42,558 --> 01:05:44,225
My wife has been planning this
for months.

898
01:05:44,393 --> 01:05:45,601
We've had five assaults this week.

899
01:05:45,769 --> 01:05:47,812
I got two COs down.
It's out of the question.

900
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:50,022
I got people flying in
from all over the place.

901
01:05:50,190 --> 01:05:52,151
Do I need to remind you
of your responsibilities

902
01:05:52,318 --> 01:05:53,569
as a unit supervisor?

903
01:05:56,865 --> 01:05:57,865
It's my kid's birthday.

904
01:05:58,032 --> 01:05:59,700
These are your kids too.

905
01:06:31,903 --> 01:06:34,030
This message was the final threat.

906
01:06:35,532 --> 01:06:37,492
Don't ever do it again.

907
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:54,928
Yeah, I put in for the shift change
two weeks ago.

908
01:06:58,182 --> 01:06:59,182
You know what?

909
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:01,851
Sometimes I don't think you understand
what I do for a fucking living!

910
01:07:04,104 --> 01:07:05,523
Hold on.

911
01:07:06,608 --> 01:07:08,859
What are you looking at?
Get back to work!

912
01:07:11,196 --> 01:07:13,239
I can't talk about this now.

913
01:07:13,406 --> 01:07:15,242
Man, that fool is pussy-whipped.

914
01:07:15,409 --> 01:07:17,619
He has no idea
how to talk to his woman.

915
01:07:17,787 --> 01:07:20,372
My girls would never talk to me
like that.

916
01:07:21,874 --> 01:07:23,708
You ain't got no fucking girls.

917
01:07:23,876 --> 01:07:25,293
Don't get me started.
All right, man?

918
01:07:25,461 --> 01:07:26,963
I am way out of your league.

919
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:30,299
No, Melissa, I'm not the only one
ruining Grace's birthday

920
01:07:30,467 --> 01:07:32,802
if they're in the room
while you're screaming at me.

921
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:34,220
Name one.

922
01:07:34,388 --> 01:07:35,638
What, like, all of them?

923
01:07:35,806 --> 01:07:38,141
Shit! It would take me all day
just to get started.

924
01:07:38,309 --> 01:07:39,226
Just name one of them.

925
01:07:39,394 --> 01:07:42,062
I'm not asking for a list.
Give me a single, solitary name.

926
01:07:42,230 --> 01:07:43,355
- Yeah.
- All right.

927
01:07:43,523 --> 01:07:45,732
- You don't got nothing, bro.
- I got... Okay, don't worry.

928
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:47,068
Nothing.

929
01:07:47,236 --> 01:07:49,988
Listen, I'll give you one,
but you gotta keep it on the hush-hush.

930
01:07:50,155 --> 01:07:51,447
Just give us the name, man.

931
01:07:51,615 --> 01:07:53,616
All right, but I don't wanna get her
in trouble.

932
01:07:53,784 --> 01:07:55,618
I won't tell no one.

933
01:07:55,786 --> 01:07:56,869
You know Miss Biggs?

934
01:07:58,707 --> 01:08:00,416
No.
Oh, yeah.

935
01:08:00,584 --> 01:08:02,418
What a whore.

936
01:08:02,586 --> 01:08:03,794
I knew something was up, though,

937
01:08:03,962 --> 01:08:06,046
'cause we haven't been connecting
in the same way.

938
01:08:06,214 --> 01:08:09,384
You know why it is? She doesn't like
that earlobe shit that you do.

939
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:11,636
You're so full of shit!
You know that?

940
01:08:11,804 --> 01:08:13,513
Calm down!
It was just a one-time thing.

941
01:08:13,681 --> 01:08:16,349
I promise. I just had to do the job
for you once.

942
01:08:16,517 --> 01:08:18,603
And now she's all yours.
It's good. It's good.

943
01:08:20,522 --> 01:08:22,857
All right, you've seen her naked,
so what does she look like?

944
01:08:24,693 --> 01:08:27,737
She's got these perfect,
36D titties, all right?

945
01:08:27,904 --> 01:08:30,616
And then she's got
these firm love handles

946
01:08:30,783 --> 01:08:32,784
and then that big, flat ass,
you know, that's all right.

947
01:08:32,952 --> 01:08:35,245
But when you get it going,
it slaps and it claps together.

948
01:08:35,413 --> 01:08:36,371
It's beautiful.

949
01:08:36,539 --> 01:08:38,415
What about her labia?

950
01:08:38,791 --> 01:08:40,168
She was definitely
on that old-school tip,

951
01:08:40,336 --> 01:08:43,046
you know, with the big bush,
but I still found her spot.

952
01:08:43,213 --> 01:08:46,341
I just had to machete my way
through her little tropical jungle

953
01:08:46,508 --> 01:08:47,759
but it was there.

954
01:08:47,926 --> 01:08:51,472
No doubt.
Oh, it was beautiful. Tasty!

955
01:08:54,142 --> 01:08:55,976
It probably looks something like this.

956
01:08:58,688 --> 01:09:00,899
Oh, ho, ho, man!
Yeah, that's her.

957
01:09:03,944 --> 01:09:05,820
You know what, Melissa?
Fuck you too!

958
01:09:05,988 --> 01:09:07,489
That's fucking good!

959
01:09:08,783 --> 01:09:11,452
How wet is that pussy?
It's just dripping!

960
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:13,496
Hey, what are you guys doing?

961
01:09:15,248 --> 01:09:16,499
Line up, all of you!

962
01:09:19,252 --> 01:09:20,628
Who drew that?

963
01:09:23,257 --> 01:09:24,591
Who drew that?

964
01:09:29,222 --> 01:09:30,681
I did.

965
01:09:30,848 --> 01:09:31,932
Your phone's ringing.

966
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:33,267
Shut up!

967
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:35,311
Why don't you answer it?

968
01:09:36,522 --> 01:09:37,689
You did.

969
01:09:42,027 --> 01:09:43,779
Let's take a closer look at your work.

970
01:09:43,947 --> 01:09:44,863
Don't fucking touch me!

971
01:09:45,031 --> 01:09:47,616
- Let him go!
- Don't fucking touch me!

972
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:51,120
Come on, chill!

973
01:09:58,295 --> 01:09:59,504
Yo, Angel.

974
01:10:00,339 --> 01:10:02,716
Hey, bro.
Come on, man. Get up.

975
01:10:04,051 --> 01:10:06,929
Yo, Angel. Get up, man.

976
01:10:08,014 --> 01:10:09,181
What the...

977
01:10:16,524 --> 01:10:17,607
What the fuck did you do?

978
01:10:19,402 --> 01:10:20,527
What the fuck, man?

979
01:10:20,695 --> 01:10:22,904
What the fuck did you do?

980
01:10:23,406 --> 01:10:24,531
On the ground now.

981
01:10:26,076 --> 01:10:27,285
What the hell happened?

982
01:10:27,453 --> 01:10:29,245
Goodyear,
what the hell happened?

983
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:31,372
Tell him what happened!

984
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:32,999
- On your belly!
- No!

985
01:10:33,167 --> 01:10:34,625
On your belly.
Arms to the side.

986
01:10:34,793 --> 01:10:37,254
Tell him what happened!
What the fuck are you doing?

987
01:10:37,422 --> 01:10:39,882
Why don't you tell him
what happened, Goodyear?!

988
01:10:40,049 --> 01:10:41,049
Fucking pussies!

989
01:10:41,217 --> 01:10:42,593
Tell him what fucking happened!

990
01:10:42,761 --> 01:10:45,179
If I were you,
I'd be calling my union rep.

991
01:10:45,346 --> 01:10:48,600
We didn't fucking do anything!
Where's that ammo?

992
01:10:48,768 --> 01:10:50,477
10-66, south main corridor now!

993
01:10:50,644 --> 01:10:52,520
Tell him what fucking happened!

994
01:11:13,211 --> 01:11:14,836
Break it up right now!

995
01:11:17,924 --> 01:11:19,759
Get away from there.

996
01:11:20,844 --> 01:11:22,345
What's up, bro?

997
01:11:23,555 --> 01:11:25,014
I'm back, kid.

998
01:11:35,985 --> 01:11:38,654
Knock it off! Relax!

999
01:11:41,951 --> 01:11:43,785
...with Steve Quailer.

1000
01:11:43,953 --> 01:11:45,995
McCleod to Quailer.
And shot! Score!

1001
01:11:46,747 --> 01:11:47,789
Yes!

1002
01:11:50,126 --> 01:11:52,670
You've reached
St. Patrick's Hospital.

1003
01:11:52,838 --> 01:11:54,171
Your call is important to us.

1004
01:11:54,339 --> 01:11:57,132
A representative will be
with you shortly.

1005
01:11:58,009 --> 01:11:59,927
We appreciate your patience.

1006
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:10,689
Get the fuck out of here.

1007
01:12:22,912 --> 01:12:24,580
No!

1008
01:12:26,1000 --> 01:12:28,542
No! No!

1009
01:12:28,710 --> 01:12:29,793
Ah!

1010
01:12:33,299 --> 01:12:34,299
Ow!

1011
01:12:34,466 --> 01:12:35,717
Hello?

1012
01:12:35,885 --> 01:12:37,635
Yes...

1013
01:12:37,803 --> 01:12:39,971
I... I'm calling from Enola Vale
Youth Correctional.

1014
01:12:41,056 --> 01:12:43,601
We had somebody admitted there
earlier this evening.

1015
01:12:43,768 --> 01:12:45,853
His name's Angel Ortiz.

1016
01:12:46,271 --> 01:12:48,647
- Well, Officer...
- Come on, man!

1017
01:12:48,815 --> 01:12:49,815
We're sorry to inform you

1018
01:12:49,983 --> 01:12:52,234
that the boy was pronounced dead
two hours ago.

1019
01:12:53,153 --> 01:12:54,696
I'm very sorry.

1020
01:13:15,845 --> 01:13:17,220
Yo, what the fuck are you doing?

1021
01:13:17,388 --> 01:13:19,139
Just fucking hold him.

1022
01:13:22,936 --> 01:13:25,271
No! No!

1023
01:13:46,211 --> 01:13:48,421
Solitary Control.

1024
01:13:50,424 --> 01:13:51,883
Open up cell 9.

1025
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:12,930
Butch. Butch!

1026
01:15:21,273 --> 01:15:23,150
What's up with Angel?

1027
01:15:23,318 --> 01:15:24,902
I don't know.
I didn't hear.

1028
01:15:25,070 --> 01:15:26,487
I'm glad you're back, though.

1029
01:15:26,654 --> 01:15:29,323
Not for long.
I'll be out of this shithole in a week.

1030
01:15:29,491 --> 01:15:31,200
I have some...
Wait, wait.

1031
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:33,828
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm...

1032
01:16:24,342 --> 01:16:26,136
Who's ringing the bell?

1033
01:16:26,303 --> 01:16:28,805
It's Davis.
I need to use the phone. Please.

1034
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:30,723
Go back to bed.

1035
01:16:32,268 --> 01:16:36,021
Give me the phone.
Let me use the phone, okay?

1036
01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:38,190
Calm down.
He's coming.

1037
01:16:45,115 --> 01:16:47,909
- Davis, what's up, kid?
- I need to use the phone, man.

1038
01:16:48,077 --> 01:16:49,619
Sorry, pal.
I can't let you out.

1039
01:16:49,787 --> 01:16:51,079
Two minutes?

1040
01:16:51,247 --> 01:16:53,206
I can't.
I'll give in a word to Sands

1041
01:16:53,374 --> 01:16:55,041
and you can call
in the morning, okay?

1042
01:16:55,209 --> 01:16:56,376
It has to be now.

1043
01:16:56,544 --> 01:16:58,921
I understand
you're feeling a little homesick,

1044
01:16:59,089 --> 01:17:00,381
but it's 3:00 in the morning.

1045
01:17:02,926 --> 01:17:04,844
I need to talk to my mother.

1046
01:17:05,012 --> 01:17:06,053
- Okay.
- Please.

1047
01:17:06,221 --> 01:17:08,348
Try and get some sleep,
and I promise tomorrow,

1048
01:17:08,516 --> 01:17:10,017
everything's gonna be a lot better,
all right?

1049
01:17:10,185 --> 01:17:12,352
- Please...
- Back to bed. Good night.

1050
01:18:56,259 --> 01:18:58,051
Control, open B2.

1051
01:19:22,037 --> 01:19:24,371
Control, open dormitory A1.

1052
01:20:27,817 --> 01:20:30,194
- Hunger strike.
- Hmm.

1053
01:20:47,547 --> 01:20:48,880
Dead.

1054
01:20:52,261 --> 01:20:53,428
Dead.

1055
01:20:53,595 --> 01:20:55,304
- Frank.
- Dead.

1056
01:20:55,472 --> 01:20:56,889
Dead.

1057
01:20:57,057 --> 01:20:58,599
Dead.

1058
01:20:58,767 --> 01:21:01,103
Dead.

1059
01:21:01,271 --> 01:21:03,564
Dead. Dead.

1060
01:21:03,731 --> 01:21:05,774
Shut the fuck up, Frank.

1061
01:21:05,942 --> 01:21:07,025
Dead.

1062
01:21:07,193 --> 01:21:08,902
Dead. Dead.

1063
01:21:09,070 --> 01:21:11,281
Dead. Dead.

1064
01:21:11,449 --> 01:21:13,241
Dead. Dead.

1065
01:21:15,035 --> 01:21:17,078
Shut the fuck up now, Frank.

1066
01:21:17,246 --> 01:21:18,329
Dead! Dead!

1067
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:23,252
Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead!

1068
01:22:00,668 --> 01:22:01,585
Get out of here!

1069
01:22:04,757 --> 01:22:05,757
Now go to your left!

1070
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:09,302
Get the fuck back there!

1071
01:22:10,679 --> 01:22:11,721
Fuck you!

1072
01:22:32,161 --> 01:22:33,620
You fucker!

1073
01:22:57,898 --> 01:23:00,191
Sit the fuck down!
What the fuck are you doing?

1074
01:23:00,359 --> 01:23:01,901
Back off me!

1075
01:23:08,201 --> 01:23:10,619
How about you,
you motherfucker?

1076
01:23:12,622 --> 01:23:15,583
Sands to Control.
I want a permanent lockdown now.

1077
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:18,211
I want you to neutralize this
in five minutes!

1078
01:23:18,379 --> 01:23:21,590
- Sands, we don't have to do this!
- Goodyear, there's no "we"!

1079
01:23:21,757 --> 01:23:24,050
I make the decisions around here!
You got that?

1080
01:23:26,053 --> 01:23:28,806
Get out of here!
Let's go!

1081
01:23:47,619 --> 01:23:49,329
Hey!

1082
01:23:51,749 --> 01:23:54,626
You pussy!
Fucking bitches!

1083
01:24:56,820 --> 01:25:00,072
- Ow!
- Butch! Follow me!

1084
01:25:13,212 --> 01:25:14,255
Butch.

1085
01:25:15,090 --> 01:25:16,173
What, man?

1086
01:25:18,677 --> 01:25:20,302
Let's fucking go, man!

1087
01:26:22,038 --> 01:26:23,413
No, no!

1088
01:26:23,581 --> 01:26:24,581
Fuck! No!

1089
01:26:24,749 --> 01:26:27,167
Oh, fuck! No!

1090
01:26:27,585 --> 01:26:28,586
Fuck!

1091
01:26:29,755 --> 01:26:31,631
Oh! No!
