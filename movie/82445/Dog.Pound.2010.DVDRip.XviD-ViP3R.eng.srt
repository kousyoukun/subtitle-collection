1
00:00:32,639 --> 00:00:35,078
Aw! Enough of that shit!

2
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:37,919
Shut the fuck up, bitch.

3
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,839
Don't call me a bitch.

4
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:56,638
You're so beautiful.

5
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,798
Get out of your fucking room!
Turn it lower, for God's sake!

6
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:31,718
Sorry, Mom!

7
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,999
Are you all right, kid?

8
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:13,558
You little fuck!

9
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,959
- Did you make this?
- No.

10
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:30,438
Your cellmate told me
you made this.

11
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,078
Don't hit me again.

12
00:02:35,399 --> 00:02:37,119
Don't do that again, man!

13
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:39,878
- Are you threatening me, boy?
- I'm fucking threatening you, man!

14
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:42,518
- Do you know where you are?
- Fucking right, bitch!

15
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:44,718
Fuck you!
Don't do it again!

16
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:53,078
I'm gonna come back in five
and you're gonna give me a name.

17
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,879
And that's an order.

18
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:09,118
Fucking cunt!

19
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:11,558
Fuck you!

20
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:32,198
Gentlemen, strip out of
your civilian clothes

21
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,078
and place all of your belongings
in the box with your name on it.

22
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,678
We'll give back your shoes
once this search is complete.

23
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,998
All of your belongings.

24
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:42,239
Shake your hair.

25
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,958
Wiggle your fingers.

26
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,598
Spread your toes.

27
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,718
Blow your nose.

28
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,998
Now turn around.

29
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:02,279
Bend over.

30
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,438
Cough.

31
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:08,878
Harder.

32
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,039
Stand up.

33
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,158
Turn around.

34
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:17,798
Okay, boys,
now we'll get you dressed.

35
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,599
Gentlemen, welcome to Enola Vale
Youth Correctional Facility.

36
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,519
I'm your superintendent,
Mr. Sands.

37
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,118
If you have any problems
or any questions during your stay here,

38
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:29,159
you will report them
to your unit supervisor,

39
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,919
in this case,
Officer Goodyear.

40
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,878
He will then report it to me.

41
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,719
As for school,
your re-socialization unit supervisor...

42
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,638
...basic rules around the place.

43
00:04:38,799 --> 00:04:40,758
You better be listening.

44
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:43,518
No weapons, no sharp items.

45
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,518
No pornographic material,
no illegal substance,

46
00:04:45,679 --> 00:04:47,878
no tobacco, no alcohol

47
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:51,118
and no signs of gang activity
will be permitted

48
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,999
on the facility of Enola Vale.

49
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,958
Any questions?

50
00:04:55,119 --> 00:04:56,319
Excellent.

51
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:03,439
You're 30 minutes late again.
What's your excuse this time?

52
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:05,359
- Did I miss something?
- That's not the point.

53
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,758
You're late and it's becoming
an ongoing habit.

54
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,238
- Were they prepped on the basics?
- I just did that.

55
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,838
Good. Perfect timing.

56
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:14,878
Well, what fresh hellions
are these?

57
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,318
Angel.

58
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:23,599
Davis.

59
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,119
Guilty as charged.

60
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,998
Yeah, well, do me a favor,
sunshine.

61
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,158
Yank the pants up.

62
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,958
There's no gangster wannabes
on my unit.

63
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:33,718
Butch.

64
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,798
Gentlemen,
pick up your belongings.

65
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:41,998
Single file.

66
00:05:55,999 --> 00:05:57,759
Where are you two mutts
coming from?

67
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,398
We just finished
Social Studies class, Mr. G.

68
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:02,198
- And where are you going?
- Going to the library.

69
00:06:02,359 --> 00:06:03,718
I'm gone the weekend,
I come back,

70
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:05,598
and you're in Special Unit.
What happened?

71
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:06,838
- Nothing.
- What you do?

72
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:08,118
I didn't do nothing.

73
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:10,398
No, you didn't do anything.
And that makes sense.

74
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:12,998
They throw you in the hole
for two days for not doing nothing.

75
00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:16,158
Why are you bothering him?
He told you he didn't do anything.

76
00:06:16,999 --> 00:06:19,559
- What, are you his lawyer?
- No.

77
00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:21,398
I'm a judge.

78
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:25,039
- Pull your pants up and move on.
- All right, Mr. G.

79
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,038
Like to see you out of that costume
by the end of the week too.

80
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:31,998
Let's go.

81
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:43,878
Butch, bed on the far left.
Davis, straight ahead.

82
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:45,118
Angel, right here.

83
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,758
Stow your gear and come over here
and line up.

84
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,878
Listen carefully.
This is a new day for you gentlemen.

85
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,558
No one in here cares about any felonies
you may have committed in the past.

86
00:06:57,719 --> 00:06:59,438
The judge may have given you
a sentence,

87
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,838
but in reality, your sentence
all depends on your behavior.

88
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:03,518
You show some good will
towards change

89
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,958
and you get an earlier parole hearing
with the judge.

90
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,839
Am I boring you, sunshine?

91
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,158
No, sir.

92
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,238
Good.

93
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:15,519
'Cause I read your report
and you should be listening the closest.

94
00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:18,518
Right now, you're all Level 1.

95
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:19,878
Evaluations will determine for us

96
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,598
whether you actually want to change
and rehabilitate.

97
00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:26,038
Show us some improvements
and you can move to Level 2

98
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,558
and become a trustee.

99
00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:29,078
You'll notice these gentlemen

100
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:31,438
by their sports black pants
and their polo shirts.

101
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:34,439
They've acknowledged they've made
some poor choices in life,

102
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:36,198
but they've proven to staff,

103
00:07:36,359 --> 00:07:37,838
and more importantly
to themselves,

104
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:40,438
that they're ready to re-enter society
with the necessary skills

105
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:43,118
to avoid further criminal behavior.

106
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,318
Becoming a trustee
comes with a lot of privileges.

107
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,038
But if you mess up,

108
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:52,038
if you try any crazy stuff
on anybody in here or yourself

109
00:07:52,679 --> 00:07:55,038
or you try to bust out,
well, congratulations.

110
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,318
You just won an orange suit
and a free trip to Special Unit.

111
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:03,278
So, gentlemen,
make your stay pleasant here

112
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,198
by being good to yourself,

113
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:09,318
your peers and the staff,
and I guarantee you'll be all right.

114
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:11,718
All right, unpack.

115
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,518
Good, boys.
Hot bowl of shit coming right up.

116
00:08:22,679 --> 00:08:24,678
- You stinkin' like shit.
- No, I don't.

117
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,758
Thanks, partner.

118
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:31,718
Do some dishes
or something, Loony. Fuck!

119
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,318
Fuck your dishes!

120
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,159
Loony, he thinks he's...

121
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,158
No.

122
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,718
Hurry up.
Keep it moving.

123
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,438
Is this seat taken?

124
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:16,398
Somebody get clumsy
with the ladle?

125
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:19,638
Don't move on it, man.

126
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:22,238
You'll just end up in the hole
where that asshole Banks wants you.

127
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,758
The best thing...

128
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:29,638
just pay no mind.

129
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:31,758
Eventually, they'll
leave you alone like they did me.

130
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,038
I mean, that was also
because I have AIDS.

131
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,958
You know, we all know
why you're in here,

132
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:47,318
especially Banks.

133
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:38,398
You like that one, huh?

134
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,118
It's pretty cool.

135
00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:44,998
It's for all the virgins
I corrupted, man.

136
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:09,718
Yo, drop it and flush it!

137
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:11,118
Don't worry 'bout it.

138
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:14,518
What the fuck?

139
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:16,958
- Throw me back my toothpaste, man.
- Fuck you! Get it yourself!

140
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:21,638
Fucking prairie nigger.

141
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:23,998
Sal!
- What?

142
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,238
Come here.

143
00:11:25,398 --> 00:11:27,478
All right, gentlemen.
Let's settle down.

144
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:29,358
Sal, get back in your bed.

145
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:33,758
Good night, gentlemen.

146
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,998
- Hey, Goodyear.
- Morning. How was the night?

147
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:39,317
No problems.

148
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:43,318
Control, open gate B2, please.

149
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:48,158
- Thank you, sir.
- Have a good day.

150
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:49,398
You too.

151
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,558
Control, open dormitory A1.

152
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,997
Wakey, wakey!

153
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:13,238
Hands off snaky! Let's go!

154
00:13:15,118 --> 00:13:15,998
Let's go, gentlemen.

155
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,318
A two-minute window
to get the bed made.

156
00:13:22,319 --> 00:13:23,958
Ends of the bed when you're done.

157
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:27,358
Let's go, guys.
Shake it off.

158
00:13:47,358 --> 00:13:50,038
Mr. Angel Ortiz,
grab your bucket and mop.

159
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:51,238
Come with me.

160
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:09,358
He's right here.

161
00:14:19,878 --> 00:14:21,077
What's up, man?

162
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,517
How's it going, man?

163
00:14:24,678 --> 00:14:25,757
What's up?

164
00:14:25,918 --> 00:14:27,598
You just get here?
Yeah.

165
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:28,678
Yeah, that's cool.

166
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:30,277
How much time did you get?

167
00:14:30,438 --> 00:14:32,197
- Three months, man.
- Oh!

168
00:14:32,358 --> 00:14:34,117
- Just three?
- Just three.

169
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:35,998
- Shit!
- That ain't shit, cuz.

170
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:38,038
You know, I just did
three months fucking three times.

171
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:41,358
I could do that on my fucking head
in the hole. You know what I mean?

172
00:14:41,518 --> 00:14:44,478
Yeah. Yeah.
So how long you got, man?

173
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:47,198
What do you mean,
how long I got?

174
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,518
Who the fuck's business is that, man?

175
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:51,598
Just asking, man.
I don't know.

176
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:54,437
Don't be asking no stupid
punk-ass questions around here.

177
00:14:55,118 --> 00:14:56,678
You'll go get yourself hurt, boy.

178
00:14:57,038 --> 00:14:58,238
Yeah, all right, man.

179
00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:01,718
- You looking to get fucked up?
- No, man.

180
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:03,197
- Looking to get fucked up?
- Relax, relax!

181
00:15:03,358 --> 00:15:04,837
Huh? Looking to get fucked up?

182
00:15:07,038 --> 00:15:09,598
Just fucking with you, man.
This nigger's a bitch, cuz.

183
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:12,517
- No, man.
- Brush it off. Calm down, man.

184
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:14,877
Your boots, though, man...

185
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,717
They're looking, uh,
pretty nice, man.

186
00:15:18,558 --> 00:15:19,838
Where did you get those at?

187
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:21,358
- At the mall.
- At the mall?

188
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,318
- Yeah.
- How much were they?

189
00:15:23,719 --> 00:15:25,758
They were, like,
I don't know, 100 bucks.

190
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:28,557
Your mom give you those kicks
or something? A little present?

191
00:15:28,718 --> 00:15:29,758
- From mommy?
- No, man.

192
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:30,878
No?

193
00:15:31,038 --> 00:15:32,957
- No, man. I bought these.
- You bought 'em?

194
00:15:33,118 --> 00:15:34,638
- Yeah.
- You a hustler, all right.

195
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:35,758
Yeah.

196
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:39,518
Fuck! Hustler hustlin'.
What size are you, 10? Big man?

197
00:15:39,678 --> 00:15:41,477
Let me check them boots out.
Cop 'em over.

198
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:42,918
No, man. I'm only an 8.

199
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:45,918
What the fuck you mean,
you is only an 8? Don't look like no 8!

200
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,798
- You fucking lying to my boy?
- Don't look like a fucking 8 to me!

201
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,198
All right, man.

202
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:53,517
Come on, man.
Don't be a bitch, man.

203
00:15:56,398 --> 00:15:58,958
- They are nice-ass boots.
- Whoo-hee!

204
00:15:59,119 --> 00:16:01,518
Yeah. I lookin' fresh to death.
You feeling me?

205
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:04,158
- Man, fresh as fuck.
- How am I looking, cuz?

206
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:05,238
Nice. Nice, cuz.

207
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,237
- How am I looking?
- They look good, man...

208
00:16:07,398 --> 00:16:08,558
They're nice-ass boots.

209
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:11,637
- Can I have it back now?
- Just feeling it out. They're comfy.

210
00:16:11,798 --> 00:16:13,638
- Let me see that other one.
- Try that shit.

211
00:16:16,438 --> 00:16:17,878
I'm gonna try that.

212
00:16:19,038 --> 00:16:20,878
It's all good, man.
It's all good. You feeling me?

213
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:23,358
Fuck, they're real nice, bro,
but fuck, too big for me, man.

214
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,718
Let me check that.
Let me try both of them on at once.

215
00:16:25,878 --> 00:16:27,437
Now that they're on my feet,

216
00:16:27,599 --> 00:16:30,277
I don't really feel like
taking them off.

217
00:16:30,438 --> 00:16:32,518
They're too comfy. Plus, I'm fresh.
You know what I mean?

218
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:35,038
Some boots right there,
they ain't tricking. They're nice.

219
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,118
Don't take no offence,
you know what I mean?

220
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:38,558
Let's peace-out of here, boys.

221
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,397
Fucking bitch.

222
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:48,478
Fuck!

223
00:17:01,558 --> 00:17:02,917
Wake up.

224
00:17:03,078 --> 00:17:04,918
The floor's not gonna mop itself.

225
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,237
Let's do it.

226
00:17:29,398 --> 00:17:31,678
Faggot.

227
00:17:33,358 --> 00:17:34,518
Fucking bitch.

228
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,638
You got him-
Butch!

229
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:39,518
What did I just say to you?
Get back to work.

230
00:17:56,998 --> 00:17:58,158
What's up, Shadow?

231
00:18:05,638 --> 00:18:07,557
Wipe that smile off.

232
00:18:08,439 --> 00:18:10,437
That's it, boys.

233
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:12,757
Let's get this shit cleaned up.

234
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,277
Loony.
Get the fuck up, man.

235
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,037
Get the fuck up.

236
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:02,478
Get the fuck up, man.

237
00:19:08,678 --> 00:19:11,597
Loony. You go first.

238
00:19:31,198 --> 00:19:33,598
What the fuck you doing, man?
Not in the face, nigger!

239
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,597
Shut up, man!

240
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:38,278
I swear to God,
if you fucking rat, man,

241
00:19:38,438 --> 00:19:41,438
I'll kill you my fucking self, man.
You feel me?

242
00:20:07,638 --> 00:20:09,557
Time's up.
Get in front of your bunks.

243
00:20:09,718 --> 00:20:10,878
Ready for inspection.

244
00:20:28,278 --> 00:20:29,757
You call this making a bed?

245
00:20:30,718 --> 00:20:32,998
Whatever. Fuck.

246
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,237
Why the fuck did you do that?

247
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,958
You better learn to control
your mouth, kid.

248
00:20:42,999 --> 00:20:44,638
I'm gonna mess it up tonight
anyways.

249
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:45,797
Fuck, like...

250
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:49,718
You are on solitary report
by supper.

251
00:20:50,478 --> 00:20:53,438
Now make your bed properly.

252
00:21:03,198 --> 00:21:05,157
Stand up straight, Frank.

253
00:21:13,758 --> 00:21:16,038
All right, boys.
Let's go. Wash up.

254
00:21:16,199 --> 00:21:18,877
Come on! Move it!

255
00:21:20,358 --> 00:21:21,557
Let's go.

256
00:21:22,478 --> 00:21:23,637
You stay put.

257
00:21:28,638 --> 00:21:31,877
That looks kind of painful.
Wanna tell me what happened?

258
00:21:33,798 --> 00:21:34,957
I slipped and fell.

259
00:21:38,838 --> 00:21:40,717
Do I look like an asshole to you?

260
00:21:44,278 --> 00:21:46,277
Well, fortunately for us,
we have some procedures in place.

261
00:21:47,358 --> 00:21:49,397
You and I are gonna issue a report.

262
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,997
And what good would that do?

263
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:54,477
I just told you I slipped
and fell in the dark.

264
00:21:54,638 --> 00:21:56,557
- In the dark?
- Yeah.

265
00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:01,318
Well, maybe a few days in solitary,
you'll come up with a few more details.

266
00:22:01,758 --> 00:22:02,637
Maybe.

267
00:22:05,078 --> 00:22:06,277
Can I go?

268
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,998
Yeah, you can go.

269
00:22:14,158 --> 00:22:15,877
Don't slip.

270
00:22:52,678 --> 00:22:56,157
- Fuck you, Banks!
- Banks, knock it off!

271
00:22:58,438 --> 00:23:00,757
Control, open gates B1.

272
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:24,397
All right, I want two lines!

273
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,637
Side by side in front of the dirt.
Line 'em up.

274
00:23:40,358 --> 00:23:41,357
Banks!

275
00:23:49,878 --> 00:23:52,237
How are you, son?
Sir, how are you?

276
00:23:52,398 --> 00:23:53,797
You doing a good job?

277
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:56,037
I've been out of the dirt
for a while now.

278
00:23:56,198 --> 00:23:59,077
...an interview with construction
after this.

279
00:23:59,238 --> 00:24:00,677
Yeah, I'd like that.

280
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,517
Aw!

281
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:14,717
Max!

282
00:24:15,878 --> 00:24:17,557
Can you at least pretend
that you're working?

283
00:24:30,078 --> 00:24:32,277
Kill it, Banks. Shut it down.

284
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:37,037
Lunch!

285
00:24:41,998 --> 00:24:44,037
Goodyear.
Move.

286
00:24:58,918 --> 00:25:00,158
Sit straight.

287
00:25:03,478 --> 00:25:05,877
You were transferred
to Enola Vale

288
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:08,557
because you assaulted
a correctional officer.

289
00:25:09,358 --> 00:25:11,797
Not 24 hours inside,
you wake up all bruised up.

290
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:17,557
I'm going to ask you for the last time:
what happened?

291
00:25:18,438 --> 00:25:20,397
I slipped and fell.

292
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:22,477
Butch, I know you're not gonna rat,

293
00:25:22,638 --> 00:25:24,917
but our concern is
for your personal safety.

294
00:25:25,078 --> 00:25:27,837
Look, I am not your punishment.

295
00:25:29,398 --> 00:25:33,837
But if you refuse to cooperate,
I have no choice but to isolate you.

296
00:25:34,318 --> 00:25:35,277
Okay.

297
00:25:37,638 --> 00:25:39,637
Goodyear, get him out of here.

298
00:25:52,398 --> 00:25:53,837
Come on in.

299
00:26:02,678 --> 00:26:04,517
Hurry up, Max.
I don't have all day.

300
00:26:05,558 --> 00:26:07,237
What's the rush,
Miss Biggs?

301
00:26:10,878 --> 00:26:13,357
So, what is it today, Max?
Is it about your HIV test?

302
00:26:13,518 --> 00:26:16,437
Don't worry, it's negative,
you can stop spreading those rumors.

303
00:26:18,958 --> 00:26:20,317
No, the truth is...

304
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:23,557
I've fallen deeply in love
with a woman

305
00:26:23,718 --> 00:26:25,637
and I just...
I don't know how to tell her.

306
00:26:25,798 --> 00:26:27,277
Well, I can't help you with that.

307
00:26:27,438 --> 00:26:29,197
Maybe Sands can give you
some good advice.

308
00:26:29,717 --> 00:26:31,837
You know, I wanna tell her
so many things.

309
00:26:31,998 --> 00:26:33,517
I got so much inside,
I just wanna...

310
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:36,117
I just...

311
00:26:36,278 --> 00:26:38,237
You know, I wrote her a poem,
because, you know,

312
00:26:38,398 --> 00:26:40,877
poetry is really the only way
I can truly express myself.

313
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:42,077
Can I read it to you?

314
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:47,557
"She's a caretaker,

315
00:26:47,718 --> 00:26:50,677
"but there's no one
to take care of her.

316
00:26:51,638 --> 00:26:52,997
"She listens to others

317
00:26:53,158 --> 00:26:55,717
"to avoid listening to her. "

318
00:26:55,878 --> 00:26:57,717
That part doesn't rhyme.
It's just an early draft, though.

319
00:26:57,878 --> 00:27:00,677
"In a world surrounded by men,
I am her only admirer.

320
00:27:00,838 --> 00:27:02,117
"The clock is ticking,
she's getting older,

321
00:27:02,278 --> 00:27:03,837
"but still no rock on the finger-"

322
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:05,477
Max, I get the point.

323
00:27:05,638 --> 00:27:07,837
I got a lot of work here.
I think you should go.

324
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:11,637
Miss Biggs,
I am seriously offended here.

325
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:14,757
I don't know if you know this,
but when it comes to creativity,

326
00:27:14,918 --> 00:27:17,357
a subject us artists
are particularly sensitive to,

327
00:27:17,518 --> 00:27:20,197
I'd really appreciate it
if you didn't interrupt me again.

328
00:27:22,438 --> 00:27:23,557
Fine.

329
00:27:25,318 --> 00:27:28,397
"I dream she's...

330
00:27:28,557 --> 00:27:30,437
"lying naked on fur,
glistening crotch

331
00:27:30,598 --> 00:27:31,757
tickled by her pinkie finger. "

332
00:27:31,918 --> 00:27:34,316
Enough Max!
Get out of here now!

333
00:27:35,478 --> 00:27:36,916
You don't get it.

334
00:27:37,078 --> 00:27:39,197
You crossed the line big time.
Get out now.

335
00:27:39,358 --> 00:27:41,277
Since one of us
doesn't see the value in art,

336
00:27:41,438 --> 00:27:42,757
there won't be a next time.

337
00:27:53,998 --> 00:27:56,077
You probably thought
I was alluding to you in that poem.

338
00:27:56,238 --> 00:27:58,477
Uh, I wasn't,
so sorry to disappoint.

339
00:27:58,638 --> 00:27:59,917
And have a good day.

340
00:28:00,998 --> 00:28:02,397
Davis.

341
00:28:04,478 --> 00:28:06,517
You know, man,
when you first come here and shit,

342
00:28:06,677 --> 00:28:08,237
boys thought you was a bitch.

343
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:10,157
At least you ain't rat
on nobody, man.

344
00:28:10,318 --> 00:28:11,917
So, you know, we're all straight?

345
00:28:12,078 --> 00:28:14,717
- Cool.
- Everything's all right, man.

346
00:28:14,878 --> 00:28:15,837
Thanks, man.

347
00:28:16,678 --> 00:28:20,077
What the fuck is it
you've got on going down there?

348
00:28:20,238 --> 00:28:22,517
Pissin' sweat out your armpits, man!

349
00:28:22,678 --> 00:28:24,677
Yeah, man, I need to change
my shirt or some shit.

350
00:28:24,838 --> 00:28:26,117
What the fuck's wrong
with you, man?

351
00:28:26,278 --> 00:28:28,437
Why you always walking 'round here
all worried and shit, man?

352
00:28:28,598 --> 00:28:30,357
You ain't gotta be scared.
You scared?

353
00:28:30,518 --> 00:28:33,717
- No, man. I'm not scared.
- You ain't got no reason to be scared.

354
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,397
You know what I mean, player?

355
00:28:35,558 --> 00:28:36,917
- Yeah.
- Everything's all good.

356
00:28:37,078 --> 00:28:38,277
Hustlers ain't scared of shit.

357
00:28:38,438 --> 00:28:39,596
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

358
00:28:39,758 --> 00:28:41,236
- You is a hustler, right?
- Yeah.

359
00:28:41,398 --> 00:28:43,637
What you hustlin'?
So you hustlin' some weed and shit?

360
00:28:43,798 --> 00:28:44,757
No, man. Pills and coke.

361
00:28:44,918 --> 00:28:46,596
- You hustle that "yay"?
- Yeah.

362
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:48,916
Movin' that "yayo"?
You like that raw shit?

363
00:28:49,078 --> 00:28:50,477
- Yeah.
- You like that shit?

364
00:28:50,638 --> 00:28:51,957
Mm-hmm.

365
00:28:52,118 --> 00:28:54,877
Yeah, so, uh, what if I had
some of that raw shit, man?

366
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:56,357
You want a bump?

367
00:28:56,518 --> 00:28:58,157
What, you have some of that?

368
00:28:58,318 --> 00:28:59,277
Yo, Loony.

369
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:01,757
Get that white shit out
for the pretty boy, man.

370
00:29:01,918 --> 00:29:03,316
He wanna get fucked up.

371
00:29:03,477 --> 00:29:04,997
All right. See you later.

372
00:29:05,158 --> 00:29:06,837
Hey, what the fuck
you doing in here?

373
00:29:06,998 --> 00:29:10,316
We're doing some big-man business.
Get the fuck out of here!

374
00:29:11,957 --> 00:29:14,557
Nice throw, you fucking faggot!
I'm gonna cut you up right now, bitch,

375
00:29:14,717 --> 00:29:16,557
and all your little bitches
are gonna see.

376
00:29:16,718 --> 00:29:18,877
- Are you shitting me, Sal?
- Yo, fuck you!

377
00:29:21,878 --> 00:29:23,997
Suck on my nuts, mutt!

378
00:29:24,158 --> 00:29:25,956
You got that white shit
for me Loony?

379
00:29:30,318 --> 00:29:32,997
Cut you a six, man.
Don't even worry about it.

380
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:38,397
It's all straight.

381
00:29:40,637 --> 00:29:43,397
Get that into you, man.
That's some good.

382
00:29:45,437 --> 00:29:48,077
Oh, shit!

383
00:29:48,238 --> 00:29:49,797
How you like that, man?

384
00:29:49,957 --> 00:29:51,677
Is that good shit?

385
00:29:51,838 --> 00:29:52,877
It's different.

386
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:55,677
Yeah, that's just 'cause it's pure.
Don't worry about it.

387
00:30:16,318 --> 00:30:20,317
Shhh! Just be quiet, man.
Shhh! Be quiet.

388
00:30:20,837 --> 00:30:22,557
- Yeah.
- Just be easy.

389
00:30:22,718 --> 00:30:24,516
Everything's okay, man.

390
00:30:24,677 --> 00:30:27,517
- Yeah.
- You're just tripping.

391
00:30:27,677 --> 00:30:29,477
- Yeah.
- It's all good.

392
00:30:29,638 --> 00:30:31,877
- Yeah.
- Shhh!

393
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:34,676
You feel good, man.

394
00:30:34,838 --> 00:30:38,236
It is the best feeling ever, man.

395
00:30:38,797 --> 00:30:40,276
Deep into your hole, man.

396
00:30:41,718 --> 00:30:45,236
You feel so good.
You're gonna be fine.

397
00:30:45,398 --> 00:30:46,637
You love being fucked up.

398
00:30:46,798 --> 00:30:47,757
No.

399
00:30:51,758 --> 00:30:52,797
What?

400
00:30:52,958 --> 00:30:54,397
What you guys give me?

401
00:30:54,557 --> 00:30:55,437
Shhh!

402
00:30:55,598 --> 00:30:57,197
Just some special medicine, man.

403
00:30:57,358 --> 00:30:59,877
Just the good medicine.

404
00:31:00,037 --> 00:31:01,396
You love it, man.

405
00:31:01,557 --> 00:31:04,077
You feel good, dog.

406
00:31:04,238 --> 00:31:06,677
Oh, look at these!

407
00:31:06,838 --> 00:31:08,237
That's the good shit, man.

408
00:31:08,397 --> 00:31:09,717
Don't wake up.

409
00:31:09,878 --> 00:31:11,597
Just go to sleep.

410
00:31:11,758 --> 00:31:14,477
Hey, is that your mom
and your sister in this photo?

411
00:31:15,158 --> 00:31:17,357
Damn, that bitch is fine!

412
00:31:17,717 --> 00:31:20,237
Tell that bitch to come see me
next visiting day, man.

413
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:21,397
I'll beat that pussy up.

414
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:25,637
Yeah, you know,
your mom was just here.

415
00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:26,677
Yeah, man.

416
00:31:26,838 --> 00:31:29,837
You know,
she left happier than she came.

417
00:31:29,998 --> 00:31:32,836
I'm so sad she left.
I miss her already.

418
00:31:33,598 --> 00:31:36,396
Yeah, you know,
she was sad when she was here.

419
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:37,797
No.

420
00:31:37,958 --> 00:31:40,317
- She was looking for you.
- You missed her.

421
00:31:40,478 --> 00:31:42,156
But she found me.

422
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:45,077
- No!
- You know, she was so beautiful.

423
00:31:46,358 --> 00:31:47,957
She wants me.

424
00:31:49,437 --> 00:31:50,916
You know,
your mom loves me.

425
00:31:51,077 --> 00:31:52,077
No.

426
00:31:52,238 --> 00:31:54,877
Your mom calls me Daddy.
NO!

427
00:31:55,037 --> 00:31:57,157
Shut up, man.
Shut the fuck up.

428
00:31:57,318 --> 00:31:58,517
Where is she? Mom!

429
00:31:58,678 --> 00:32:00,676
Shut up, man!
He's a fucking heat bag.

430
00:32:00,838 --> 00:32:02,637
Fuck it. Let's go.
Let's go, man.

431
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:05,036
Fucking too much.

432
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:28,516
Help...

433
00:32:30,957 --> 00:32:32,596
Help!

434
00:32:37,238 --> 00:32:38,197
Help!

435
00:32:41,758 --> 00:32:43,237
- Get on your feet, boy.
- I can't.

436
00:32:43,398 --> 00:32:45,277
- Come on, get up.
- No.

437
00:32:45,438 --> 00:32:46,677
Come on, boy.
Get on your feet.

438
00:32:47,878 --> 00:32:48,877
Come on.

439
00:32:51,718 --> 00:32:52,717
Come on.

440
00:33:03,998 --> 00:33:05,637
Stand here.
Don't move.

441
00:33:05,797 --> 00:33:07,716
Oh! Oh!

442
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:19,477
Come here.

443
00:33:20,197 --> 00:33:21,156
Swallow.

444
00:33:46,957 --> 00:33:48,596
Solitary Control.

445
00:33:49,557 --> 00:33:50,956
Unlock 7.

446
00:33:59,118 --> 00:34:01,157
This is not a punishment.
It's for your own good.

447
00:34:01,318 --> 00:34:04,037
Try to drink lots of water
to flush that shit out of your system.

448
00:34:28,077 --> 00:34:32,076
I wait along the borders of disdain

449
00:34:34,797 --> 00:34:36,237
Staring in

450
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:37,596
Open your mouth.

451
00:34:38,357 --> 00:34:39,516
What I would give

452
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:42,317
To be within your arms

453
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:44,036
Thank you.

454
00:34:44,198 --> 00:34:46,397
Dry and warm

455
00:34:49,278 --> 00:34:51,836
- Where's the file, eh? Come on. Oh!
- Stop it.

456
00:34:51,997 --> 00:34:54,237
- Where's those files that you stole?
- Stop it.

457
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:58,276
Give me the scent of free

458
00:34:58,437 --> 00:35:01,757
Syringa tree

459
00:35:03,558 --> 00:35:06,037
It's final call

460
00:35:09,277 --> 00:35:12,597
Lonely voice upon a mountaintop

461
00:35:14,717 --> 00:35:16,437
Shouting out

462
00:35:19,397 --> 00:35:22,357
The secrets of a generation told

463
00:35:24,717 --> 00:35:27,076
All the lies

464
00:35:30,357 --> 00:35:33,916
Blind and riding
on the ocean's spine

465
00:35:34,797 --> 00:35:36,156
No fault of mine

466
00:35:36,318 --> 00:35:37,437
Davis.

467
00:35:39,957 --> 00:35:43,357
Drowning is what I've perfected for

468
00:35:44,558 --> 00:35:45,836
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

469
00:35:45,997 --> 00:35:47,276
All my life

470
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:49,396
Hasty!

471
00:35:49,557 --> 00:35:50,597
What happened here?

472
00:35:52,918 --> 00:35:53,836
Getting a little rough.

473
00:35:53,997 --> 00:35:55,797
No, man, I can't wait
to dig up ditches again tomorrow.

474
00:35:56,638 --> 00:35:58,596
- I don't care.
- Should be a good time.

475
00:35:58,757 --> 00:36:00,877
- That's all he cares about.
- Wishful thoughts, eh?

476
00:36:01,197 --> 00:36:04,717
Banks, let's go.
Good night, gentlemen.

477
00:36:10,437 --> 00:36:11,597
Give me

478
00:36:13,277 --> 00:36:15,516
The scent of free

479
00:36:15,677 --> 00:36:17,757
Syringa tree

480
00:36:18,598 --> 00:36:20,996
Crowning me

481
00:36:21,157 --> 00:36:22,516
My victory march

482
00:36:23,357 --> 00:36:25,837
The marble arch

483
00:36:25,998 --> 00:36:28,437
Trumpet horn

484
00:36:28,598 --> 00:36:30,797
It's final call

485
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:48,956
All right, boys.

486
00:36:49,117 --> 00:36:50,557
Go back to the dorms,

487
00:36:50,717 --> 00:36:52,796
wash up, change your clothes.

488
00:36:53,558 --> 00:36:55,116
Move out.

489
00:37:31,757 --> 00:37:33,116
Yo, faggot,
throw the ball back.

490
00:37:36,037 --> 00:37:37,997
Yo, I'm talking to you, faggot!

491
00:37:42,437 --> 00:37:43,996
Look, fuck you, man,
all right?

492
00:37:44,158 --> 00:37:45,636
What the fuck
did you just say to me?

493
00:37:46,638 --> 00:37:49,156
You want me to fuck you up,
faggot?

494
00:37:50,237 --> 00:37:52,316
Got your friend here.
What are you-

495
00:37:55,278 --> 00:37:56,637
Ow!

496
00:38:00,277 --> 00:38:02,557
You get the fuck back!
Where the fuck's Banks?

497
00:38:02,717 --> 00:38:04,236
- He's upstairs.
- Thank you.

498
00:38:04,397 --> 00:38:05,636
Let's go.

499
00:38:26,558 --> 00:38:27,517
Let's go.

500
00:38:37,798 --> 00:38:38,956
Keep watch.

501
00:38:39,117 --> 00:38:40,397
All right.

502
00:39:16,598 --> 00:39:17,956
Davis!

503
00:39:20,438 --> 00:39:21,996
Get rid of it.

504
00:39:30,318 --> 00:39:32,637
-10-99, rec room.
What the hell happened here?

505
00:39:32,798 --> 00:39:34,756
On your belly.
Arms by your side.

506
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:40,836
Who did this to you?

507
00:39:46,957 --> 00:39:48,236
Who did this to him?

508
00:39:48,397 --> 00:39:49,797
Don't know.

509
00:39:55,677 --> 00:39:57,156
Sands to Control.

510
00:39:58,117 --> 00:40:00,637
10-66, lavatory, dorm A.

511
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:04,836
Get to the end of the bed,
both of you, now.

512
00:40:09,077 --> 00:40:10,237
What did I say to you?

513
00:40:11,237 --> 00:40:13,836
I said no retaliation,
you fucking moron!

514
00:40:13,997 --> 00:40:15,636
What are you talking about?

515
00:40:15,797 --> 00:40:17,596
You really do think I'm stupid,
don't you?

516
00:40:17,757 --> 00:40:18,916
No, I don't.

517
00:40:19,077 --> 00:40:21,876
You think you're the first tough guy
to walk through these halls?

518
00:40:22,797 --> 00:40:25,716
Think you're the first guy to ever lay
a beat down on somebody?

519
00:40:27,037 --> 00:40:28,316
Probably not.

520
00:40:28,478 --> 00:40:31,836
Well, I know I'm not your first CO,
so let's go, you and me.

521
00:40:35,077 --> 00:40:36,837
Yo, he didn't fucking do anything.
Chill!

522
00:40:36,997 --> 00:40:39,037
- Shut your mouth.
- Don't do that again.

523
00:40:39,197 --> 00:40:40,796
Don't do what again?

524
00:40:41,357 --> 00:40:43,916
- Don't fucking do that again.
- Come on, let's go.

525
00:40:46,718 --> 00:40:48,077
Come on. Throw down.

526
00:41:12,237 --> 00:41:13,876
Oh! Baby!

527
00:41:14,837 --> 00:41:16,996
Oh, my sweetie.
Okay, Mom.

528
00:41:23,557 --> 00:41:25,797
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

529
00:41:26,757 --> 00:41:29,876
- Are the kids still picking on you?
- No one's picking on me, Mom.

530
00:41:30,037 --> 00:41:31,996
I took care of that on my own,
all right?

531
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:35,636
Baby, I'm taking care of it.
I filed a suit against this institution.

532
00:41:35,797 --> 00:41:38,276
Why the fuck
would you do that, Mom?

533
00:41:39,677 --> 00:41:41,437
Baby, I called Uncle Conrad,

534
00:41:41,597 --> 00:41:43,796
and he has put me in touch
with a top lawyer.

535
00:41:45,797 --> 00:41:48,436
So what can I tell the lawyer?
When can he come and visit you?

536
00:41:48,597 --> 00:41:50,236
You can tell him to go fuck himself.

537
00:41:51,117 --> 00:41:52,196
Davis.

538
00:41:52,357 --> 00:41:53,876
I gotta go, Mom.

539
00:41:54,037 --> 00:41:55,636
No, sweetie.
Let me help you.

540
00:41:55,797 --> 00:41:56,956
No.

541
00:42:02,757 --> 00:42:04,316
Remove the hat, please.

542
00:42:26,637 --> 00:42:28,756
It's good.

543
00:42:29,597 --> 00:42:31,876
Ah! That's...

544
00:42:32,677 --> 00:42:35,436
And your family is missing you, huh?

545
00:42:40,197 --> 00:42:42,756
You keep on saying that.

546
00:42:42,917 --> 00:42:44,716
You keep on saying that.
Whatever.

547
00:42:44,877 --> 00:42:46,636
You guys aren't doing anything, so...

548
00:43:05,117 --> 00:43:06,036
Boys!

549
00:43:25,197 --> 00:43:26,916
...they had the door unlocked.

550
00:43:27,077 --> 00:43:29,036
We opened it up
and it was just sitting there.

551
00:43:29,197 --> 00:43:31,516
It was just sitting there.

552
00:43:31,677 --> 00:43:33,916
It was just like... like...
Watch this right here.

553
00:43:34,077 --> 00:43:35,516
Just fucking sitting there...

554
00:43:41,557 --> 00:43:44,996
- Hey, give me your bread!
- There's this special school...

555
00:44:16,637 --> 00:44:18,036
Hey, yo, are you Butch?

556
00:44:19,237 --> 00:44:20,756
Who wants to know?

557
00:44:20,917 --> 00:44:23,076
This nigger Shadow
wants to talk to you.

558
00:44:24,037 --> 00:44:25,596
For what?

559
00:44:27,037 --> 00:44:28,556
Don't know.

560
00:44:40,677 --> 00:44:42,596
Harrel, could you please
close the door?

561
00:44:51,717 --> 00:44:53,356
It's nice to see everyone here.

562
00:44:54,397 --> 00:44:56,436
Let's start by grading the day.

563
00:44:56,596 --> 00:44:58,196
Who wants to go first?

564
00:45:01,517 --> 00:45:02,996
Okay, I'll go first.

565
00:45:03,157 --> 00:45:05,756
For me, today is a 6...

566
00:45:05,917 --> 00:45:07,836
because this morning

567
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:10,995
I lost my temper in traffic
with a jerk at a red light.

568
00:45:11,956 --> 00:45:13,396
Butch?

569
00:45:13,557 --> 00:45:16,236
- Seven.
- You wanna tell us why?

570
00:45:16,397 --> 00:45:18,356
Just got out
of the fucking hole today.

571
00:45:18,517 --> 00:45:21,596
- Good.
- Zero.

572
00:45:23,317 --> 00:45:24,956
Do you want to tell us why?

573
00:45:28,077 --> 00:45:29,396
No.

574
00:45:29,557 --> 00:45:31,996
Frank, you've been at zero now
for months.

575
00:45:32,157 --> 00:45:35,196
Is there nothing that's positive?

576
00:45:37,196 --> 00:45:38,356
No.

577
00:45:38,517 --> 00:45:41,156
Okay, we can talk
about that later.

578
00:45:42,556 --> 00:45:44,595
Harrel, can you read
what we're talking about today?

579
00:45:44,756 --> 00:45:49,156
"Evaluating and rel... re-label... "

580
00:45:52,237 --> 00:45:54,195
- Shut up, man.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

581
00:45:54,356 --> 00:45:55,636
I'll read it.

582
00:45:55,797 --> 00:45:57,276
"Anger and aggression. "

583
00:45:57,437 --> 00:46:00,795
I think we all realize
that everybody feels anger,

584
00:46:00,957 --> 00:46:03,636
but not everybody can control it,

585
00:46:03,796 --> 00:46:06,356
which is why
you guys are here today.

586
00:46:06,517 --> 00:46:10,356
So anger is a good thing
if you can control it,

587
00:46:10,516 --> 00:46:14,036
but it's a definite disadvantage
if you can't control it.

588
00:46:14,197 --> 00:46:16,996
So, let's start by talking
about what makes us angry.

589
00:46:17,157 --> 00:46:18,876
Harrel, what makes you angry?

590
00:46:19,036 --> 00:46:22,195
That I'm not next to you at night,
Miss Biggs.

591
00:46:22,357 --> 00:46:23,436
Harrel, that's enough.

592
00:46:23,477 --> 00:46:26,435
What kind of ass-ugly nigger like you
would want to get a girl like her?

593
00:46:26,597 --> 00:46:28,116
Don't fucking call me no nigger!

594
00:46:28,277 --> 00:46:29,875
Thank you, gentlemen,
for going down.

595
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:32,195
- What's wrong with you?
- Frank, what about you?

596
00:46:32,357 --> 00:46:33,835
What makes you angry?

597
00:46:34,796 --> 00:46:35,956
Fat people.

598
00:46:36,117 --> 00:46:38,876
They walk slowly in the middle
of the hallway.

599
00:46:39,037 --> 00:46:42,195
They're always sweating,
farting, funking up the dorm.

600
00:46:42,356 --> 00:46:44,996
Takes them an hour for them
to drop fat,

601
00:46:45,157 --> 00:46:46,836
anaconda shits
while I'm face-to-face with them

602
00:46:46,996 --> 00:46:49,796
trying to wash my face
or brush my motherfucking teeth.

603
00:46:49,957 --> 00:46:52,276
- That's a lot of f-words.
- Blame your mom.

604
00:46:53,996 --> 00:46:54,916
My mom?

605
00:46:55,077 --> 00:46:57,596
For giving you the big-ass nostrils
that look like sunglasses, son.

606
00:46:57,757 --> 00:46:59,996
This is a good example of-

607
00:47:00,157 --> 00:47:02,915
Every time we're talking,
you know what it really does?

608
00:47:03,076 --> 00:47:03,956
- What?
- It pisses me off.

609
00:47:04,117 --> 00:47:06,075
One day, I'm gonna get up
and snap your neck.

610
00:47:06,237 --> 00:47:09,075
- Move those lips so much.
- You wanna test me?

611
00:47:09,236 --> 00:47:10,676
- I'm right here!
- I'll break your neck.

612
00:47:10,837 --> 00:47:13,475
This is really-
You ain't making no moves.

613
00:47:13,636 --> 00:47:15,316
That's nothing. I'll show you.

614
00:47:15,477 --> 00:47:16,956
Sit!

615
00:47:17,117 --> 00:47:18,036
Boys, that's enough.

616
00:47:18,197 --> 00:47:20,916
- You wanna fucking do this?
- Frank, that's enough.

617
00:47:21,077 --> 00:47:22,996
- What are you gonna do?
- No touching! Break it up.

618
00:47:23,157 --> 00:47:25,596
Break it up!

619
00:47:25,757 --> 00:47:27,796
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Right now!

620
00:47:27,957 --> 00:47:29,235
Let's do this!
I'm right here!

621
00:47:29,396 --> 00:47:30,596
You wanna go?

622
00:47:30,756 --> 00:47:32,796
You wanna go?
Let's go!

623
00:47:32,956 --> 00:47:34,836
Emergency A-23.
Send me a CO now.

624
00:47:38,436 --> 00:47:40,515
I'll, uh... I'll come and see you
after the family visits.

625
00:47:40,677 --> 00:47:42,196
Okay, bro?

626
00:47:42,357 --> 00:47:43,436
Settle down!

627
00:47:46,357 --> 00:47:48,556
- Get off him!
- Stop it!

628
00:47:48,716 --> 00:47:50,036
Let go!

629
00:47:50,916 --> 00:47:53,636
- You want some, huh?
- Frank!

630
00:47:55,077 --> 00:47:56,275
Okay, take him!

631
00:47:56,437 --> 00:47:57,996
I got you, baby!

632
00:47:58,157 --> 00:48:00,276
You are done!
You hear that?

633
00:48:09,357 --> 00:48:11,876
Here. I gotta go.
The CO's waiting for me upstairs.

634
00:48:13,276 --> 00:48:14,676
Let me see the other guy's cut.

635
00:48:14,837 --> 00:48:16,116
What?

636
00:48:16,276 --> 00:48:18,036
Let me see the other guy's cut.

637
00:48:18,997 --> 00:48:20,716
Oh, here we go!

638
00:48:23,556 --> 00:48:25,716
Shadow paid for that.
He's expecting it.

639
00:48:25,876 --> 00:48:27,795
Turn around
and spread your legs.

640
00:48:27,956 --> 00:48:30,996
- There's a fucking CO waiting-
- Turn around and spread your legs.

641
00:48:33,156 --> 00:48:34,115
That's not how it works.

642
00:48:41,116 --> 00:48:43,356
I don't like sneaky people
doing sneaky shit behind my back.

643
00:48:43,517 --> 00:48:45,716
Don't know what you're talking about,
but we have a system here.

644
00:48:45,877 --> 00:48:48,716
Fuck your system.
Today is my way.

645
00:49:10,636 --> 00:49:12,115
What the hell?

646
00:49:13,037 --> 00:49:14,956
Fuck off with that shit, man!

647
00:49:15,116 --> 00:49:16,436
Fuck!

648
00:49:16,597 --> 00:49:18,196
Or tell us what you're thinkin'.

649
00:49:18,357 --> 00:49:19,955
Shit, man!
You just ruined it.

650
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:23,956
- Tell us one of your lady stories, B.
- Good idea!

651
00:49:24,117 --> 00:49:25,596
Yeah, boy!
Yeah, yeah!

652
00:49:25,757 --> 00:49:28,956
- Yeah, man!
- Oh! All right.

653
00:49:29,116 --> 00:49:30,316
Make it good.

654
00:49:30,476 --> 00:49:32,756
So I'm sleeping over
at my girl's house, right?

655
00:49:33,197 --> 00:49:35,916
And she's on the rag,
so she just wants to go to sleep.

656
00:49:36,077 --> 00:49:38,076
I got the worst case
of blue balls, all right?

657
00:49:39,637 --> 00:49:41,595
Fuck that bitch, dog.
Fuck that bitch!

658
00:49:44,317 --> 00:49:47,075
So I... I just go downstairs
to the living room.

659
00:49:47,236 --> 00:49:48,595
I'm in my boxers.

660
00:49:48,756 --> 00:49:51,796
And chilling out, throw on the TV
and I just light up a "J".

661
00:49:57,197 --> 00:49:59,835
But then the front door opens.

662
00:49:59,996 --> 00:50:01,875
And who walks in?

663
00:50:02,036 --> 00:50:03,275
Her fucking mom!

664
00:50:03,436 --> 00:50:04,915
I think she's gonna
either bitch me out

665
00:50:05,076 --> 00:50:07,556
or make some small talk
and go off to bed, but no.

666
00:50:07,717 --> 00:50:09,396
She takes off her jacket.

667
00:50:09,556 --> 00:50:13,275
She's wearing this dress that makes
her titties just pop right out.

668
00:50:13,436 --> 00:50:16,116
And then she comes
and she sits right next to me.

669
00:50:16,757 --> 00:50:20,316
I don't know what the hell to say,
so I'm just trying to watch TV.

670
00:50:20,477 --> 00:50:23,676
But I could see out of the corner
of my eye that's she's looking at me.

671
00:50:23,836 --> 00:50:26,796
And then she says:
"Can I get a drag of that?"

672
00:50:28,197 --> 00:50:29,475
And I'm like: "Sure".

673
00:50:29,636 --> 00:50:31,675
So I'm watching her smoke this thing,

674
00:50:31,836 --> 00:50:33,796
and she's got these big,
juicy lips,

675
00:50:33,957 --> 00:50:36,195
and she's getting red lipstick
all over the tip of it.

676
00:50:36,356 --> 00:50:39,956
And she's blowing smoke in my face,
and I'm trying to concentrate on TV.

677
00:50:40,117 --> 00:50:41,596
But when she gives the spliff back,

678
00:50:41,757 --> 00:50:44,715
some ash falls right on my boxers.

679
00:50:44,877 --> 00:50:46,276
And before I can even do anything,

680
00:50:46,437 --> 00:50:50,276
she bends over and blows the ash off
with her mouth.

681
00:50:50,436 --> 00:50:52,276
And the bitch just sits back and says:

682
00:50:52,437 --> 00:50:54,275
"I'm gonna go to bed now. "

683
00:50:54,436 --> 00:50:57,236
I'm watching her go,
and before she gets to the doorway,

684
00:50:57,397 --> 00:50:59,996
she turns back and says:
"Good night, Davis. "

685
00:51:01,637 --> 00:51:04,116
You want that bitch!
You want that, white boy!

686
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:08,675
So, what the fuck would you do?
What would you do?

687
00:51:08,836 --> 00:51:10,595
I knew I had to do something, right?

688
00:51:10,756 --> 00:51:12,515
I'm not a fucking idiot.
So I start...

689
00:51:12,676 --> 00:51:15,076
I start sneaking up the stairs
really slowly.

690
00:51:15,237 --> 00:51:17,836
And I walk into her room
really, really slowly.

691
00:51:17,996 --> 00:51:19,076
She can't hear me.

692
00:51:19,236 --> 00:51:20,956
And when I get there,

693
00:51:21,117 --> 00:51:23,115
she's just combing her hair
in her vanity mirror.

694
00:51:23,277 --> 00:51:26,355
And she's just, like,
looking all sultry, all sexy.

695
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:28,875
And then when she notices me
standing there,

696
00:51:29,037 --> 00:51:30,156
what does she say?

697
00:51:31,476 --> 00:51:33,395
"Would you help me
with my zipper?"

698
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:39,876
Mommy's naughty!

699
00:51:40,037 --> 00:51:42,435
- Damn, son!
- So now I'm fucking...

700
00:51:42,596 --> 00:51:44,716
Now I'm standing behind her, right?

701
00:51:44,876 --> 00:51:47,795
I'm standing behind her,
unzipping her dress,

702
00:51:47,956 --> 00:51:50,515
and she starts leaning forward
towards the mirror

703
00:51:50,676 --> 00:51:51,956
so she could see her face
closer in the mirror.

704
00:51:52,117 --> 00:51:55,355
And that means that her ass
is back up against my dick,

705
00:51:55,517 --> 00:51:56,675
like, brushing against me.

706
00:51:56,836 --> 00:51:59,676
And I don't know what the fuck
goes through my head,

707
00:51:59,836 --> 00:52:02,676
but I slap her ass and then I go:

708
00:52:02,836 --> 00:52:05,075
Lay back on the bed, bitch,
and open your legs.

709
00:52:05,236 --> 00:52:07,076
"What the fuck did you just say?"

710
00:52:07,236 --> 00:52:09,276
And then she grabs me
by the throat,

711
00:52:09,436 --> 00:52:10,995
throws me down
on that fucking bed,

712
00:52:11,157 --> 00:52:13,875
jumps on me
and starts sucking on my face, man.

713
00:52:15,796 --> 00:52:17,596
Yeah! Yeah!

714
00:52:18,756 --> 00:52:19,836
That's my boy!

715
00:52:27,156 --> 00:52:28,395
Whoa!

716
00:52:38,116 --> 00:52:41,955
Good morning, ladies!
Gather round the middle.

717
00:52:48,956 --> 00:52:50,796
Let's see how your team spirit
is this morning.

718
00:52:50,957 --> 00:52:52,876
We're gonna play a game
called dodge ball.

719
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:54,995
Now mix up into two teams.

720
00:53:16,636 --> 00:53:18,435
We're not gonna have
any of this bullshit

721
00:53:18,596 --> 00:53:19,915
on my court this morning.

722
00:53:20,916 --> 00:53:23,075
You ain't no wiggers,
no niggers, no fucking crackers.

723
00:53:23,236 --> 00:53:25,275
I don't give a shit
what you think you is.

724
00:53:25,436 --> 00:53:28,835
You're a bunch of stray dogs
that got locked up in this dog pound

725
00:53:29,796 --> 00:53:31,035
and you all stink the same!

726
00:53:31,196 --> 00:53:32,715
Now mix this shit up!

727
00:53:36,357 --> 00:53:38,035
Sweat Marks,
get your ass over there now.

728
00:53:39,757 --> 00:53:42,755
Anybody else want my foot in their ass?
Now mix this shit up!

729
00:53:50,116 --> 00:53:51,915
My rules are simple.

730
00:53:52,476 --> 00:53:53,955
Strike your opponent with the ball.

731
00:53:54,116 --> 00:53:55,836
Dodge it, catch it

732
00:53:55,996 --> 00:53:58,395
and do not step on the line
or your team loses.

733
00:53:59,156 --> 00:54:00,435
Ready?

734
00:54:03,676 --> 00:54:06,155
On your mark... set...

735
00:54:15,196 --> 00:54:16,516
You're out!

736
00:54:18,317 --> 00:54:19,276
Come on!

737
00:54:21,877 --> 00:54:23,275
You're out, big boy!

738
00:54:24,757 --> 00:54:26,995
Come on, man. You're gone.

739
00:54:33,277 --> 00:54:35,716
This is your time
to get your aggression out.

740
00:54:35,877 --> 00:54:37,475
Now, brother!

741
00:54:37,637 --> 00:54:39,115
You're out! You're out.

742
00:54:39,876 --> 00:54:41,636
Let's go! Come on!

743
00:54:42,877 --> 00:54:44,755
- Come on!
- Get him!

744
00:54:44,917 --> 00:54:46,836
Come on!
Come on, take him out!

745
00:54:47,876 --> 00:54:48,915
Sweat Marks!

746
00:54:49,076 --> 00:54:50,676
Yeah, Sweat Marks!

747
00:54:50,836 --> 00:54:54,035
Sweat Marks! Sweat Marks!

748
00:54:54,196 --> 00:54:55,356
Oh!

749
00:54:55,516 --> 00:54:57,315
Sweat Marks!
Sweat Marks!

750
00:54:57,476 --> 00:54:58,595
One more!

751
00:54:58,756 --> 00:55:00,475
Sweat Marks!
Sweat Marks!

752
00:55:15,556 --> 00:55:17,715
Yeah!
You're my bitch now!

753
00:55:17,876 --> 00:55:19,795
Oh, shit!

754
00:55:21,397 --> 00:55:22,555
Yo, man,
what's in there?

755
00:55:22,716 --> 00:55:25,755
Sour OJ,
bread and a lot of sugar.

756
00:55:26,036 --> 00:55:28,075
Angel, was that your dad
that came to visit today?

757
00:55:28,236 --> 00:55:29,395
Yep.

758
00:55:29,556 --> 00:55:31,075
When's your mom gonna come?

759
00:55:33,116 --> 00:55:35,676
Man, I'll fucking slit your throat
if you go there.

760
00:55:35,836 --> 00:55:36,756
- What?
- Seriously.

761
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:39,315
When's you mom gonna come.
Is she cute?

762
00:55:39,476 --> 00:55:41,156
I don't know, fuck.

763
00:55:41,316 --> 00:55:43,196
You can tell if a woman's pretty
even if it's your mom.

764
00:55:43,357 --> 00:55:45,555
- I dunno.
- Is she an attractive woman?

765
00:55:45,716 --> 00:55:46,715
She's my mom, man!

766
00:55:46,876 --> 00:55:49,395
Would you have sex with her
if you were not her son?

767
00:55:51,116 --> 00:55:52,956
- Uh-oh!
- Are you stupid?

768
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:54,675
You gettin' at my neck, boy?

769
00:55:55,636 --> 00:55:57,075
What's this? What the fuck?

770
00:55:57,236 --> 00:55:58,716
What are you gonna do,
little man?

771
00:55:58,876 --> 00:56:01,235
Come on. Oh!
You fag!

772
00:56:01,476 --> 00:56:03,636
Fuck! All right! All right.

773
00:56:04,597 --> 00:56:05,875
Don't fucking kiss me,
you fucking fag!

774
00:56:06,036 --> 00:56:08,436
All right, dog. All right.

775
00:56:09,756 --> 00:56:12,035
- Thank you.
- Yo, why don't we talk about your mom?

776
00:56:13,276 --> 00:56:16,275
My mom's a cunt.
When I get out, I'm moving out.

777
00:56:16,436 --> 00:56:17,636
Don't worry about my mom.

778
00:56:17,796 --> 00:56:19,836
Perfect,
because when I get out of here,

779
00:56:20,756 --> 00:56:22,836
when you move,
I'm moving in.

780
00:56:23,236 --> 00:56:25,155
Into your mama's ass.

781
00:56:25,317 --> 00:56:27,315
Shut up, man! Shut up!

782
00:56:27,476 --> 00:56:29,115
What are you actually gonna do
when you get out, man?

783
00:56:29,716 --> 00:56:30,875
Uh, I wanna join the circus.

784
00:56:31,036 --> 00:56:32,955
Oh, yeah? Join the circus.

785
00:56:33,116 --> 00:56:34,995
Yeah, me too.
We'll all be in a clown costume.

786
00:56:35,156 --> 00:56:36,755
No, bro.
That's not funny, man.

787
00:56:36,916 --> 00:56:38,235
I'm serious.
Sure.

788
00:56:38,956 --> 00:56:40,355
My father was in the circus.

789
00:56:41,316 --> 00:56:42,876
He died when I was 10, man.

790
00:56:43,956 --> 00:56:46,755
He was doing a show
where he had to juggle some chainsaws,

791
00:56:46,916 --> 00:56:48,475
kind of like what I'm doing right now.

792
00:56:48,637 --> 00:56:50,315
But one of them fell out of his hand,

793
00:56:50,476 --> 00:56:52,476
and as it fell down,
it cut his cock right off.

794
00:56:59,956 --> 00:57:01,595
COs! COs!

795
00:57:08,116 --> 00:57:09,555
What are you guys doing?

796
00:57:11,236 --> 00:57:13,316
- Laundry.
- You haven't even started your chores.

797
00:57:13,476 --> 00:57:14,395
Well, on that happy note,

798
00:57:14,557 --> 00:57:16,115
you're all drawing extra work duty
on Sunday.

799
00:57:16,276 --> 00:57:17,795
Fuck!

800
00:57:17,956 --> 00:57:19,555
Butch, follow me.

801
00:57:57,676 --> 00:57:58,915
Sit down.

802
00:58:02,916 --> 00:58:04,995
What's your plan, son?

803
00:58:05,156 --> 00:58:06,595
My plan?

804
00:58:06,756 --> 00:58:09,395
I mean after all this,
incarceration.

805
00:58:11,916 --> 00:58:14,035
Well, I want to study
at a circus school.

806
00:58:14,196 --> 00:58:16,035
Are you being sarcastic?

807
00:58:17,316 --> 00:58:18,675
Not at all.

808
00:58:19,036 --> 00:58:20,035
Hmm...

809
00:58:20,196 --> 00:58:22,635
The reason I'm asking you this
is because authorities

810
00:58:22,796 --> 00:58:25,795
have investigated the officer
you blinded.

811
00:58:25,996 --> 00:58:28,755
More than 10 parties of legal guardians
have complained

812
00:58:28,916 --> 00:58:31,875
that their children
were physically abused by this man.

813
00:58:32,836 --> 00:58:35,355
I assume you acted in self-defense.

814
00:58:35,516 --> 00:58:37,116
To cut to the chase,
you have an opportunity here-

815
00:58:37,276 --> 00:58:38,555
No, no, no.

816
00:58:39,996 --> 00:58:42,315
I took a careful look
at your report, son.

817
00:58:42,996 --> 00:58:45,756
If that incident with this officer
hadn't occurred,

818
00:58:46,596 --> 00:58:48,755
technically,
you'd be released this week.

819
00:58:48,916 --> 00:58:51,835
But in those next two weeks,
any misconduct on your part,

820
00:58:51,996 --> 00:58:54,915
we withdraw the plea and it goes back
to the original charge,

821
00:58:55,076 --> 00:58:55,995
which is, as you know,

822
00:58:56,156 --> 00:58:59,635
four years in an adult facility
starting the day you turn 19.

823
00:58:59,796 --> 00:59:01,555
So with that in mind, son,

824
00:59:02,516 --> 00:59:04,515
I think you're responsible enough

825
00:59:04,676 --> 00:59:07,395
to make the right choices inside,

826
00:59:08,116 --> 00:59:09,995
and then in the outside world...

827
00:59:10,916 --> 00:59:12,475
hopefully,
in a circus school.

828
00:59:15,116 --> 00:59:16,715
Am I right?

829
00:59:19,076 --> 00:59:20,915
Yes, sir. Thank you.

830
00:59:22,276 --> 00:59:24,795
Good. You can go.

831
00:59:39,156 --> 00:59:41,315
Where's my cheeseburger?

832
00:59:44,436 --> 00:59:46,155
Slow down, man.
You're gonna get some indigestion.

833
00:59:47,316 --> 00:59:49,195
You eating your nuggets?

834
00:59:49,356 --> 00:59:51,995
Yeah, I'm eating my nuggets.
I'm saving the best for last.

835
00:59:52,836 --> 00:59:54,035
Why the fuck would you do that?

836
00:59:55,716 --> 00:59:58,595
Eating's like making love, man.
It's a ritual, you know?

837
00:59:58,756 --> 01:00:00,155
You got your appetizer,

838
01:00:00,316 --> 01:00:02,315
I sniff deeply into her scalp

839
01:00:02,476 --> 01:00:05,235
and grab onto her firm,
but voluptuous hips,

840
01:00:05,396 --> 01:00:07,275
nibble just ever so gently
on the earlobe.

841
01:00:07,436 --> 01:00:08,955
I mean, girls,
they go wild for that.

842
01:00:09,116 --> 01:00:11,915
Why don't you skip the appetizer
and go straight to the main course?

843
01:00:12,316 --> 01:00:13,355
Well, what's the main course?

844
01:00:13,516 --> 01:00:15,395
Main course:
you bust a nut, she bounces,

845
01:00:15,556 --> 01:00:16,995
play some video games,

846
01:00:17,156 --> 01:00:19,795
do whatever the fuck you want
and then you go to sleep.

847
01:00:21,196 --> 01:00:23,755
You're an animal, you know that?
You disgust me.

848
01:00:23,916 --> 01:00:25,995
For me, the entrée is,

849
01:00:26,155 --> 01:00:28,275
you know,
gentle circling the areola,

850
01:00:28,436 --> 01:00:30,674
kissing every notch of her spine,
lower and lower and lower

851
01:00:30,836 --> 01:00:32,995
until my tongue hovers
on her bellybutton.

852
01:00:33,156 --> 01:00:34,555
I take my time.

853
01:00:34,716 --> 01:00:37,235
Yeah, you take so much time
that this girl's gonna be half asleep

854
01:00:37,395 --> 01:00:39,155
by the time you even get
to her cookie.

855
01:00:39,315 --> 01:00:41,915
Just like your food is getting all cold
and soggy now.

856
01:00:42,076 --> 01:00:43,795
And you don't know
what food tastes like,

857
01:00:43,956 --> 01:00:46,955
'cause you wolf that shit down
like you haven't eaten in days.

858
01:00:47,116 --> 01:00:48,755
Come on!
These are women.

859
01:00:50,876 --> 01:00:52,355
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Dude!

860
01:00:54,476 --> 01:00:55,995
No, no, man!
That's my protein!

861
01:00:56,156 --> 01:00:57,275
You're hungry?

862
01:00:58,795 --> 01:01:00,235
I can't even get that nugget.
It's disgusting.

863
01:01:01,316 --> 01:01:03,594
Rebound. Rebound. You like that?
It was a rebound.

864
01:01:06,036 --> 01:01:07,875
Butch!
Come on, man!

865
01:01:08,036 --> 01:01:09,235
That was awesome!

866
01:01:09,396 --> 01:01:10,915
You know how old this spinach is?

867
01:01:11,076 --> 01:01:13,555
It's like, six-month-old spinach
on my face.

868
01:01:13,716 --> 01:01:16,195
That was a sweet move.
You're a jerk, you know that?

869
01:01:16,355 --> 01:01:17,315
Oh!

870
01:01:17,476 --> 01:01:18,515
Good job, bro.

871
01:01:19,635 --> 01:01:20,874
Oh! You like that?

872
01:01:21,916 --> 01:01:23,915
I'm gonna kill you, man.
Don't do it again, please.

873
01:01:46,876 --> 01:01:48,835
Look at us.

874
01:01:48,995 --> 01:01:51,115
Look at us.
Okay, we need gloves for this.

875
01:01:51,276 --> 01:01:52,355
10-66...

876
01:01:52,516 --> 01:01:54,075
Did you see anyone?

877
01:01:54,236 --> 01:01:55,595
Did you see anyone?

878
01:01:56,236 --> 01:01:57,195
Anyone see what happened?

879
01:01:57,355 --> 01:01:59,755
Sit back down.

880
01:02:01,916 --> 01:02:03,755
Nobody saw anything, huh?

881
01:02:05,156 --> 01:02:08,115
Simple.
Everyone's to blame.

882
01:02:10,276 --> 01:02:12,075
Greaves.

883
01:02:12,236 --> 01:02:14,195
What do you got?

884
01:02:15,756 --> 01:02:18,715
- I haven't found anything so far.
- Okay.

885
01:02:24,795 --> 01:02:26,595
All right, get back in there,

886
01:02:26,756 --> 01:02:28,315
clean up that mess
and make your beds.

887
01:02:28,476 --> 01:02:30,475
Lights go out in five. Move.

888
01:02:35,956 --> 01:02:38,395
That's okay.
You just have to explain.

889
01:02:41,556 --> 01:02:43,955
Look, I gotta call you...
I'm... I gotta call you back.

890
01:02:46,236 --> 01:02:48,475
The way we tossed the dorm
scared the hell out of them.

891
01:02:48,636 --> 01:02:50,275
I don't think we're gonna have
any further problems.

892
01:02:50,435 --> 01:02:51,475
Let's hope so.

893
01:02:52,476 --> 01:02:53,594
I'd like to also remind you

894
01:02:53,756 --> 01:02:55,514
that I've booked tomorrow off
for my daughter's party.

895
01:02:55,676 --> 01:02:57,154
Out of the question.

896
01:02:58,356 --> 01:02:59,955
My wife has been planning this
for months.

897
01:03:00,116 --> 01:03:01,274
We've had five assaults this week.

898
01:03:01,436 --> 01:03:03,395
I got two COs down.
It's out of the question.

899
01:03:03,556 --> 01:03:05,514
I got people flying in
from all over the place.

900
01:03:05,675 --> 01:03:07,555
Do I need to remind you
of your responsibilities

901
01:03:07,715 --> 01:03:08,915
as a unit supervisor?

902
01:03:12,076 --> 01:03:13,035
It's my kid's birthday.

903
01:03:13,195 --> 01:03:14,795
These are your kids too.

904
01:03:45,676 --> 01:03:47,715
This message was the final threat.

905
01:03:49,155 --> 01:03:51,035
Don't ever do it again.

906
01:04:05,516 --> 01:04:07,755
Yeah, I put in for the shift change
two weeks ago.

907
01:04:10,876 --> 01:04:11,835
You know what?

908
01:04:11,996 --> 01:04:14,395
Sometimes I don't think you understand
what I do for a fucking living!

909
01:04:16,555 --> 01:04:17,915
Hold on.

910
01:04:18,956 --> 01:04:21,115
What are you looking at?
Get back to work!

911
01:04:23,356 --> 01:04:25,315
I can't talk about this now.

912
01:04:25,475 --> 01:04:27,235
Man, that fool is pussy-whipped.

913
01:04:27,395 --> 01:04:29,515
He has no idea
how to talk to his woman.

914
01:04:29,676 --> 01:04:32,155
My girls would never talk to me
like that.

915
01:04:33,595 --> 01:04:35,354
You ain't got no fucking girls.

916
01:04:35,515 --> 01:04:36,874
Don't get me started.
All right, man?

917
01:04:37,036 --> 01:04:38,475
I am way out of your league.

918
01:04:38,635 --> 01:04:41,674
No, Melissa, I'm not the only one
ruining Grace's birthday

919
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:44,075
if they're in the room
while you're screaming at me.

920
01:04:44,236 --> 01:04:45,435
Name one.

921
01:04:45,596 --> 01:04:46,795
What, like, all of them?

922
01:04:46,956 --> 01:04:49,194
Shit! It would take me all day
just to get started.

923
01:04:49,355 --> 01:04:50,235
Just name one of them.

924
01:04:50,396 --> 01:04:52,955
I'm not asking for a list.
Give me a single, solitary name.

925
01:04:53,116 --> 01:04:54,195
- Yeah.
- All right.

926
01:04:54,356 --> 01:04:56,474
- You don't got nothing, bro.
- I got... Okay, don't worry.

927
01:04:56,635 --> 01:04:57,755
Nothing.

928
01:04:57,916 --> 01:05:00,555
Listen, I'll give you one,
but you gotta keep it on the hush-hush.

929
01:05:00,715 --> 01:05:01,954
Just give us the name, man.

930
01:05:02,115 --> 01:05:04,034
All right, but I don't wanna get her
in trouble.

931
01:05:04,196 --> 01:05:05,954
I won't tell no one.

932
01:05:06,116 --> 01:05:07,154
You know Miss Biggs?

933
01:05:08,916 --> 01:05:10,555
No.
Oh, yeah.

934
01:05:10,716 --> 01:05:12,475
What a whore.

935
01:05:12,636 --> 01:05:13,795
I knew something was up, though,

936
01:05:13,956 --> 01:05:15,954
'cause we haven't been connecting
in the same way.

937
01:05:16,115 --> 01:05:19,155
You know why it is? She doesn't like
that earlobe shit that you do.

938
01:05:19,316 --> 01:05:21,314
You're so full of shit!
You know that?

939
01:05:21,476 --> 01:05:23,115
Calm down!
It was just a one-time thing.

940
01:05:23,276 --> 01:05:25,834
I promise. I just had to do the job
for you once.

941
01:05:25,996 --> 01:05:27,995
And now she's all yours.
It's good. It's good.

942
01:05:29,836 --> 01:05:32,075
All right, you've seen her naked,
so what does she look like?

943
01:05:33,836 --> 01:05:36,755
She's got these perfect,
36D titties, all right?

944
01:05:36,915 --> 01:05:39,515
And then she's got
these firm love handles

945
01:05:39,675 --> 01:05:41,594
and then that big, flat ass,
you know, that's all right.

946
01:05:41,755 --> 01:05:43,954
But when you get it going,
it slaps and it claps together.

947
01:05:44,116 --> 01:05:45,034
It's beautiful.

948
01:05:45,195 --> 01:05:46,995
What about her labia?

949
01:05:47,355 --> 01:05:48,675
She was definitely
on that old-school tip,

950
01:05:48,836 --> 01:05:51,435
you know, with the big bush,
but I still found her spot.

951
01:05:51,595 --> 01:05:54,595
I just had to machete my way
through her little tropical jungle

952
01:05:54,755 --> 01:05:55,955
but it was there.

953
01:05:56,115 --> 01:05:59,515
No doubt.
Oh, it was beautiful. Tasty!

954
01:06:02,076 --> 01:06:03,834
It probably looks something like this.

955
01:06:06,435 --> 01:06:08,555
Oh, ho, ho, man!
Yeah, that's her.

956
01:06:11,475 --> 01:06:13,274
You know what, Melissa?
Fuck you too!

957
01:06:13,435 --> 01:06:14,875
That's fucking good!

958
01:06:16,116 --> 01:06:18,675
How wet is that pussy?
It's just dripping!

959
01:06:18,836 --> 01:06:20,635
Hey, what are you guys doing?

960
01:06:22,315 --> 01:06:23,515
Line up, all of you!

961
01:06:26,155 --> 01:06:27,475
Who drew that?

962
01:06:29,995 --> 01:06:31,274
Who drew that?

963
01:06:35,716 --> 01:06:37,115
I did.

964
01:06:37,275 --> 01:06:38,315
Your phone's ringing.

965
01:06:38,476 --> 01:06:39,594
Shut up!

966
01:06:39,755 --> 01:06:41,554
Why don't you answer it?

967
01:06:42,716 --> 01:06:43,835
You did.

968
01:06:47,995 --> 01:06:49,675
Let's take a closer look at your work.

969
01:06:49,836 --> 01:06:50,714
Don't fucking touch me!

970
01:06:50,875 --> 01:06:53,354
- Let him go!
- Don't fucking touch me!

971
01:06:53,875 --> 01:06:56,715
Come on, chill!

972
01:07:03,595 --> 01:07:04,755
Yo, Angel.

973
01:07:05,555 --> 01:07:07,835
Hey, bro.
Come on, man. Get up.

974
01:07:09,115 --> 01:07:11,874
Yo, Angel. Get up, man.

975
01:07:12,915 --> 01:07:14,034
What the...

976
01:07:21,076 --> 01:07:22,114
What the fuck did you do?

977
01:07:23,836 --> 01:07:24,915
What the fuck, man?

978
01:07:25,076 --> 01:07:27,194
What the fuck did you do?

979
01:07:27,676 --> 01:07:28,755
On the ground now.

980
01:07:30,235 --> 01:07:31,395
What the hell happened?

981
01:07:31,556 --> 01:07:33,275
Goodyear,
what the hell happened?

982
01:07:34,075 --> 01:07:35,314
Tell him what happened!

983
01:07:35,475 --> 01:07:36,875
- On your belly!
- No!

984
01:07:37,036 --> 01:07:38,434
On your belly.
Arms to the side.

985
01:07:38,595 --> 01:07:40,954
Tell him what happened!
What the fuck are you doing?

986
01:07:41,116 --> 01:07:43,475
Why don't you tell him
what happened, Goodyear?!

987
01:07:43,635 --> 01:07:44,594
Fucking pussies!

988
01:07:44,755 --> 01:07:46,075
Tell him what fucking happened!

989
01:07:46,236 --> 01:07:48,555
If I were you,
I'd be calling my union rep.

990
01:07:48,715 --> 01:07:51,835
We didn't fucking do anything!
Where's that ammo?

991
01:07:51,996 --> 01:07:53,635
10-66, south main corridor now!

992
01:07:53,795 --> 01:07:55,594
Tell him what fucking happened!

993
01:08:15,436 --> 01:08:16,994
Break it up right now!

994
01:08:19,956 --> 01:08:21,715
Get away from there.

995
01:08:22,755 --> 01:08:24,195
What's up, bro?

996
01:08:25,355 --> 01:08:26,754
I'm back, kid.

997
01:08:37,275 --> 01:08:39,835
Knock it off! Relax!

998
01:08:42,996 --> 01:08:44,755
...with Steve Quailer.

999
01:08:44,916 --> 01:08:46,874
McCleod to Quailer.
And shot! Score!

1000
01:08:47,595 --> 01:08:48,595
Yes!

1001
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:53,275
You've reached
St. Patrick's Hospital.

1002
01:08:53,436 --> 01:08:54,714
Your call is important to us.

1003
01:08:54,875 --> 01:08:57,554
A representative will be
with you shortly.

1004
01:08:58,395 --> 01:09:00,234
We appreciate your patience.

1005
01:09:08,916 --> 01:09:10,555
Get the fuck out of here.

1006
01:09:22,275 --> 01:09:23,875
No!

1007
01:09:26,196 --> 01:09:27,675
No! No!

1008
01:09:27,836 --> 01:09:28,874
Ah!

1009
01:09:32,236 --> 01:09:33,195
Ow!

1010
01:09:33,355 --> 01:09:34,555
Hello?

1011
01:09:34,716 --> 01:09:36,394
Yes...

1012
01:09:36,555 --> 01:09:38,634
I... I'm calling from Enola Vale
Youth Correctional.

1013
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:42,115
We had somebody admitted there
earlier this evening.

1014
01:09:42,275 --> 01:09:44,275
His name's Angel Ortiz.

1015
01:09:44,675 --> 01:09:46,954
- Well, Officer...
- Come on, man!

1016
01:09:47,115 --> 01:09:48,074
We're sorry to inform you

1017
01:09:48,235 --> 01:09:50,394
that the boy was pronounced dead
two hours ago.

1018
01:09:51,276 --> 01:09:52,754
I'm very sorry.

1019
01:10:13,035 --> 01:10:14,354
Yo, what the fuck are you doing?

1020
01:10:14,515 --> 01:10:16,194
Just fucking hold him.

1021
01:10:19,836 --> 01:10:22,074
No! No!

1022
01:10:42,156 --> 01:10:44,274
Solitary Control.

1023
01:10:46,195 --> 01:10:47,594
Open up cell 9.

1024
01:12:03,195 --> 01:12:05,314
Butch. Butch!

1025
01:12:13,315 --> 01:12:15,114
What's up with Angel?

1026
01:12:15,275 --> 01:12:16,795
I don't know.
I didn't hear.

1027
01:12:16,956 --> 01:12:18,315
I'm glad you're back, though.

1028
01:12:18,475 --> 01:12:21,034
Not for long.
I'll be out of this shithole in a week.

1029
01:12:21,196 --> 01:12:22,835
I have some...
Wait, wait.

1030
01:12:23,755 --> 01:12:25,354
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm...

1031
01:13:13,795 --> 01:13:15,515
Who's ringing the bell?

1032
01:13:15,675 --> 01:13:18,074
It's Davis.
I need to use the phone. Please.

1033
01:13:18,396 --> 01:13:19,914
Go back to bed.

1034
01:13:21,395 --> 01:13:24,994
Give me the phone.
Let me use the phone, okay?

1035
01:13:25,875 --> 01:13:27,074
Calm down.
He's coming.

1036
01:13:33,715 --> 01:13:36,394
- Davis, what's up, kid?
- I need to use the phone, man.

1037
01:13:36,555 --> 01:13:38,034
Sorry, pal.
I can't let you out.

1038
01:13:38,195 --> 01:13:39,434
Two minutes?

1039
01:13:39,595 --> 01:13:41,474
I can't.
I'll give in a word to Sands

1040
01:13:41,635 --> 01:13:43,234
and you can call
in the morning, okay?

1041
01:13:43,395 --> 01:13:44,514
It has to be now.

1042
01:13:44,675 --> 01:13:46,954
I understand
you're feeling a little homesick,

1043
01:13:47,115 --> 01:13:48,354
but it's 3:00 in the morning.

1044
01:13:50,795 --> 01:13:52,634
I need to talk to my mother.

1045
01:13:52,795 --> 01:13:53,794
- Okay.
- Please.

1046
01:13:53,955 --> 01:13:55,994
Try and get some sleep,
and I promise tomorrow,

1047
01:13:56,155 --> 01:13:57,594
everything's gonna be a lot better,
all right?

1048
01:13:57,756 --> 01:13:59,834
- Please...
- Back to bed. Good night.

1049
01:15:39,475 --> 01:15:41,194
Control, open B2.

1050
01:16:04,195 --> 01:16:06,434
Control, open dormitory A1.

1051
01:17:07,275 --> 01:17:09,554
- Hunger strike.
- Hmm.

1052
01:17:26,195 --> 01:17:27,474
Dead.

1053
01:17:30,715 --> 01:17:31,834
Dead.

1054
01:17:31,995 --> 01:17:33,634
- Frank.
- Dead.

1055
01:17:33,795 --> 01:17:35,154
Dead.

1056
01:17:35,315 --> 01:17:36,794
Dead.

1057
01:17:36,955 --> 01:17:39,194
Dead.

1058
01:17:39,355 --> 01:17:41,554
Dead. Dead.

1059
01:17:41,714 --> 01:17:43,674
Shut the fuck up, Frank.

1060
01:17:43,835 --> 01:17:44,873
Dead.

1061
01:17:45,035 --> 01:17:46,674
Dead. Dead.

1062
01:17:46,835 --> 01:17:48,954
Dead. Dead.

1063
01:17:49,115 --> 01:17:50,834
Dead. Dead.

1064
01:17:52,554 --> 01:17:54,514
Shut the fuck up now, Frank.

1065
01:17:54,675 --> 01:17:55,714
Dead! Dead!

1066
01:17:57,354 --> 01:18:00,434
Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead!

1067
01:18:36,314 --> 01:18:37,194
Get out of here!

1068
01:18:40,235 --> 01:18:41,194
Now go to your left!

1069
01:18:43,115 --> 01:18:44,594
Get the fuck back there!

1070
01:18:45,914 --> 01:18:46,914
Fuck you!

1071
01:19:06,515 --> 01:19:07,914
You fucker!

1072
01:19:31,195 --> 01:19:33,394
Sit the fuck down!
What the fuck are you doing?

1073
01:19:33,555 --> 01:19:35,034
Back off me!

1074
01:19:41,075 --> 01:19:43,394
How about you,
you motherfucker?

1075
01:19:45,315 --> 01:19:48,154
Sands to Control.
I want a permanent lockdown now.

1076
01:19:48,314 --> 01:19:50,674
I want you to neutralize this
in five minutes!

1077
01:19:50,835 --> 01:19:53,914
- Sands, we don't have to do this!
- Goodyear, there's no "we"!

1078
01:19:54,074 --> 01:19:56,273
I make the decisions around here!
You got that?

1079
01:19:58,194 --> 01:20:00,834
Get out of here!
Let's go!

1080
01:20:18,875 --> 01:20:20,514
Hey!

1081
01:20:22,835 --> 01:20:25,594
You pussy!
Fucking bitches!

1082
01:21:25,235 --> 01:21:28,354
- Ow!
- Butch! Follow me!

1083
01:21:40,955 --> 01:21:41,954
Butch.

1084
01:21:42,755 --> 01:21:43,793
What, man?

1085
01:21:46,195 --> 01:21:47,753
Let's fucking go, man!

1086
01:22:46,955 --> 01:22:48,273
No, no!

1087
01:22:48,435 --> 01:22:49,394
Fuck! No!

1088
01:22:49,555 --> 01:22:51,874
Oh, fuck! No!

1089
01:22:52,275 --> 01:22:53,234
Fuck!

1090
01:22:54,355 --> 01:22:56,154
Oh! No!

1091
01:23:13,035 --> 01:23:17,514
Blind and riding
on the ocean's spine

1092
01:23:18,554 --> 01:23:21,074
No fault of mine

1093
01:23:21,834 --> 01:23:24,154
Drowning is what I've perfected

1094
01:23:24,314 --> 01:23:28,153
For all my life
