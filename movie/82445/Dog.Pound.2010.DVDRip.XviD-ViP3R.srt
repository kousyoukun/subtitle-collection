00:00:32,931 --> 00:00:35,370
Aw! Enough of that shit!

3
00:00:36,651 --> 00:00:38,211
Shut the fuck up, bitch.

4
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,131
Don't call me a bitch.

5
00:00:55,533 --> 00:00:56,932
You're so beautiful.

6
00:01:27,857 --> 00:01:30,096
Get out of your fucking room!
Turn it lower, for God's sake!

7
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:32,016
Sorry, Mom!

8
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:08,300
Are you all right, kid?

9
00:02:11,702 --> 00:02:13,861
You little fuck!

10
00:02:24,223 --> 00:02:27,263
- Did you make this?
- No.

11
00:02:28,943 --> 00:02:30,742
Your cellmate told me
you made this.

12
00:02:30,904 --> 00:02:32,383
Don't hit me again.

13
00:02:35,704 --> 00:02:37,424
Don't do that again, man!

14
00:02:37,584 --> 00:02:40,183
- Are you threatening me, boy?
- I'm fucking threatening you, man!

15
00:02:40,344 --> 00:02:42,824
- Do you know where you are?
- Fucking right, bitch!

16
00:02:42,985 --> 00:02:45,024
Fuck you!
Don't do it again!

17
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:53,385
I'm gonna come back in five
and you're gonna give me a name.

18
00:02:54,906 --> 00:02:56,186
And that's an order.

19
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:09,427
Fucking cunt!

20
00:03:10,828 --> 00:03:11,867
Fuck you!

21
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,509
Gentlemen, strip out of
your civilian clothes

22
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,390
and place all of your belongings
in the box with your name on it.

23
00:03:35,551 --> 00:03:37,990
We'll give back your shoes
once this search is complete.

24
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,310
All of your belongings.

25
00:03:41,431 --> 00:03:42,551
Shake your hair.

26
00:03:43,672 --> 00:03:45,271
Wiggle your fingers.

27
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:46,911
Spread your toes.

28
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:49,031
Blow your nose.

29
00:03:55,752 --> 00:03:57,312
Now turn around.

30
00:04:01,433 --> 00:04:02,593
Bend over.

31
00:04:05,394 --> 00:04:06,753
Cough.

32
00:04:08,234 --> 00:04:09,193
Harder.

33
00:04:10,395 --> 00:04:11,354
Stand up.

34
00:04:13,275 --> 00:04:14,474
Turn around.

35
00:04:16,275 --> 00:04:18,114
Okay, boys,
now we'll get you dressed.

36
00:04:19,395 --> 00:04:21,915
Gentlemen, welcome to Enola Vale
Youth Correctional Facility.

37
00:04:22,076 --> 00:04:23,835
I'm your superintendent,
Mr. Sands.

38
00:04:23,996 --> 00:04:27,435
If you have any problems
or any questions during your stay here,

39
00:04:27,596 --> 00:04:29,476
you will report them
to your unit supervisor,

40
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:31,236
in this case,
Officer Goodyear.

41
00:04:31,397 --> 00:04:33,195
He will then report it to me.

42
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:36,036
As for school,
your re-socialization unit supervisor...

43
00:04:37,517 --> 00:04:38,956
...basic rules around the place.

44
00:04:39,117 --> 00:04:41,077
You better be listening.

45
00:04:41,238 --> 00:04:43,837
No weapons, no sharp items.

46
00:04:43,998 --> 00:04:45,837
No pornographic material,
no illegal substance,

47
00:04:45,998 --> 00:04:48,197
no tobacco, no alcohol

48
00:04:48,359 --> 00:04:51,437
and no signs of gang activity
will be permitted

49
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:53,318
on the facility of Enola Vale.

50
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:55,278
Any questions?

51
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:56,639
Excellent.

52
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,760
You're 30 minutes late again.
What's your excuse this time?

53
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,680
- Did I miss something?
- That's not the point.

54
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,080
You're late and it's becoming
an ongoing habit.

55
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,560
- Were they prepped on the basics?
- I just did that.

56
00:05:10,721 --> 00:05:12,160
Good. Perfect timing.

57
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,200
Well, what fresh hellions
are these?

58
00:05:18,242 --> 00:05:19,641
Angel.

59
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:23,922
Davis.

60
00:05:24,082 --> 00:05:25,442
Guilty as charged.

61
00:05:25,602 --> 00:05:27,322
Yeah, well, do me a favor,
sunshine.

62
00:05:27,483 --> 00:05:28,482
Yank the pants up.

63
00:05:28,643 --> 00:05:30,282
There's no gangster wannabes
on my unit.

64
00:05:32,923 --> 00:05:34,043
Butch.

65
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,123
Gentlemen,
pick up your belongings.

66
00:05:41,284 --> 00:05:42,323
Single file.

67
00:05:56,325 --> 00:05:58,085
Where are you two mutts
coming from?

68
00:05:58,246 --> 00:06:00,725
We just finished
Social Studies class, Mr. G.

69
00:06:00,886 --> 00:06:02,525
- And where are you going?
- Going to the library.

70
00:06:02,687 --> 00:06:04,046
I'm gone the weekend,
I come back,

71
00:06:04,207 --> 00:06:05,926
and you're in Special Unit.
What happened?

72
00:06:06,087 --> 00:06:07,166
- Nothing.
- What you do?

73
00:06:07,327 --> 00:06:08,446
I didn't do nothing.

74
00:06:08,607 --> 00:06:10,726
No, you didn't do anything.
And that makes sense.

75
00:06:10,887 --> 00:06:13,326
They throw you in the hole
for two days for not doing nothing.

76
00:06:13,487 --> 00:06:16,487
Why are you bothering him?
He told you he didn't do anything.

77
00:06:17,328 --> 00:06:19,888
- What, are you his lawyer?
- No.

78
00:06:20,048 --> 00:06:21,727
I'm a judge.

79
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:25,368
- Pull your pants up and move on.
- All right, Mr. G.

80
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:28,369
Like to see you out of that costume
by the end of the week too.

81
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,329
Let's go.

82
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:44,210
Butch, bed on the far left.
Davis, straight ahead.

83
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:45,450
Angel, right here.

84
00:06:46,171 --> 00:06:48,090
Stow your gear and come over here
and line up.

85
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:54,211
Listen carefully.
This is a new day for you gentlemen.

86
00:06:54,972 --> 00:06:57,891
No one in here cares about any felonies
you may have committed in the past.

87
00:06:58,052 --> 00:06:59,772
The judge may have given you
a sentence,

88
00:06:59,933 --> 00:07:02,172
but in reality, your sentence
all depends on your behavior.

89
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,852
You show some good will
towards change

90
00:07:04,013 --> 00:07:06,292
and you get an earlier parole hearing
with the judge.

91
00:07:06,573 --> 00:07:08,173
Am I boring you, sunshine?

92
00:07:10,253 --> 00:07:11,493
No, sir.

93
00:07:11,654 --> 00:07:12,573
Good.

94
00:07:12,734 --> 00:07:15,854
'Cause I read your report
and you should be listening the closest.

95
00:07:17,335 --> 00:07:18,854
Right now, you're all Level 1.

96
00:07:19,135 --> 00:07:20,214
Evaluations will determine for us

97
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,934
whether you actually want to change
and rehabilitate.

98
00:07:24,336 --> 00:07:26,375
Show us some improvements
and you can move to Level 2

99
00:07:26,536 --> 00:07:27,895
and become a trustee.

100
00:07:28,495 --> 00:07:29,415
You'll notice these gentlemen

101
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:31,775
by their sports black pants
and their polo shirts.

102
00:07:32,056 --> 00:07:34,776
They've acknowledged they've made
some poor choices in life,

103
00:07:35,017 --> 00:07:36,536
but they've proven to staff,

104
00:07:36,697 --> 00:07:38,176
and more importantly
to themselves,

105
00:07:38,617 --> 00:07:40,776
that they're ready to re-enter society
with the necessary skills

106
00:07:40,937 --> 00:07:43,456
to avoid further criminal behavior.

107
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:46,657
Becoming a trustee
comes with a lot of privileges.

108
00:07:46,818 --> 00:07:48,377
But if you mess up,

109
00:07:48,538 --> 00:07:52,377
if you try any crazy stuff
on anybody in here or yourself

110
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:55,377
or you try to bust out,
well, congratulations.

111
00:07:55,538 --> 00:07:58,658
You just won an orange suit
and a free trip to Special Unit.

112
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,618
So, gentlemen,
make your stay pleasant here

113
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:05,538
by being good to yourself,

114
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,659
your peers and the staff,
and I guarantee you'll be all right.

115
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,060
All right, unpack.

116
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,861
Good, boys.
Hot bowl of shit coming right up.

117
00:08:23,022 --> 00:08:25,021
- You stinkin' like shit.
- No, I don't.

118
00:08:27,422 --> 00:08:29,101
Thanks, partner.

119
00:08:29,262 --> 00:08:32,062
Do some dishes
or something, Loony. Fuck!

120
00:08:32,223 --> 00:08:33,662
Fuck your dishes!

121
00:08:34,983 --> 00:08:36,503
Loony, he thinks he's...

122
00:08:52,385 --> 00:08:53,504
No.

123
00:08:54,145 --> 00:08:56,064
Hurry up.
Keep it moving.

124
00:09:03,506 --> 00:09:04,785
Is this seat taken?

125
00:09:14,908 --> 00:09:16,746
Somebody get clumsy
with the ladle?

126
00:09:18,868 --> 00:09:19,986
Don't move on it, man.

127
00:09:20,147 --> 00:09:22,587
You'll just end up in the hole
where that asshole Banks wants you.

128
00:09:26,109 --> 00:09:27,108
The best thing...

129
00:09:28,469 --> 00:09:29,988
just pay no mind.

130
00:09:30,148 --> 00:09:32,108
Eventually, they'll
leave you alone like they did me.

131
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:37,389
I mean, that was also
because I have AIDS.

132
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,310
You know, we all know
why you're in here,

133
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,670
especially Banks.

134
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:38,755
You like that one, huh?

135
00:10:40,036 --> 00:10:41,475
It's pretty cool.

136
00:10:42,797 --> 00:10:45,356
It's for all the virgins
I corrupted, man.

137
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:10,079
Yo, drop it and flush it!

138
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,479
Don't worry 'bout it.

139
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,879
What the fuck?

140
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,319
- Throw me back my toothpaste, man.
- Fuck you! Get it yourself!

141
00:11:20,321 --> 00:11:22,000
Fucking prairie nigger.

142
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,360
Sal!
- What?

143
00:11:24,522 --> 00:11:25,601
Come here.

144
00:11:25,761 --> 00:11:27,840
All right, gentlemen.
Let's settle down.

145
00:11:28,001 --> 00:11:29,721
Sal, get back in your bed.

146
00:11:32,602 --> 00:11:34,122
Good night, gentlemen.

147
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:38,368
- Hey, Goodyear.
- Morning. How was the night?

148
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:39,688
No problems.

149
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:43,688
Control, open gate B2, please.

150
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,529
- Thank you, sir.
- Have a good day.

151
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:49,769
You too.

152
00:13:03,652 --> 00:13:05,931
Control, open dormitory A1.

153
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:11,371
Wakey, wakey!

154
00:13:11,532 --> 00:13:13,612
Hands off snaky! Let's go!

155
00:13:15,493 --> 00:13:16,372
Let's go, gentlemen.

156
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:18,692
A two-minute window
to get the bed made.

157
00:13:22,694 --> 00:13:24,333
Ends of the bed when you're done.

158
00:13:26,175 --> 00:13:27,733
Let's go, guys.
Shake it off.

159
00:13:47,736 --> 00:13:50,416
Mr. Angel Ortiz,
grab your bucket and mop.

160
00:13:50,577 --> 00:13:51,616
Come with me.

161
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:09,738
He's right here.

162
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,459
What's up, man?

163
00:14:23,341 --> 00:14:24,899
How's it going, man?

164
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,139
What's up?

165
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,980
You just get here?
Yeah.

166
00:14:28,141 --> 00:14:29,060
Yeah, that's cool.

167
00:14:29,221 --> 00:14:30,660
How much time did you get?

168
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:32,580
- Three months, man.
- Oh!

169
00:14:32,741 --> 00:14:34,500
- Just three?
- Just three.

170
00:14:34,661 --> 00:14:36,381
- Shit!
- That ain't shit, cuz.

171
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,421
You know, I just did
three months fucking three times.

172
00:14:38,582 --> 00:14:41,742
I could do that on my fucking head
in the hole. You know what I mean?

173
00:14:41,902 --> 00:14:44,862
Yeah. Yeah.
So how long you got, man?

174
00:14:46,063 --> 00:14:47,582
What do you mean,
how long I got?

175
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,902
Who the fuck's business is that, man?

176
00:14:50,063 --> 00:14:51,983
Just asking, man.
I don't know.

177
00:14:52,144 --> 00:14:54,823
Don't be asking no stupid
punk-ass questions around here.

178
00:14:55,504 --> 00:14:57,063
You'll go get yourself hurt, boy.

179
00:14:57,424 --> 00:14:58,624
Yeah, all right, man.

180
00:14:59,824 --> 00:15:02,103
- You looking to get fucked up?
- No, man.

181
00:15:02,265 --> 00:15:03,583
- Looking to get fucked up?
- Relax, relax!

182
00:15:03,745 --> 00:15:05,224
Huh? Looking to get fucked up?

183
00:15:07,425 --> 00:15:09,985
Just fucking with you, man.
This nigger's a bitch, cuz.

184
00:15:11,106 --> 00:15:12,904
- No, man.
- Brush it off. Calm down, man.

185
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,265
Your boots, though, man...

186
00:15:16,306 --> 00:15:18,105
They're looking, uh,
pretty nice, man.

187
00:15:18,946 --> 00:15:20,225
Where did you get those at?

188
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:21,746
- At the mall.
- At the mall?

189
00:15:21,907 --> 00:15:23,706
- Yeah.
- How much were they?

190
00:15:24,107 --> 00:15:26,146
They were, like,
I don't know, 100 bucks.

191
00:15:26,307 --> 00:15:28,946
Your mom give you those kicks
or something? A little present?

192
00:15:29,107 --> 00:15:30,147
- From mommy?
- No, man.

193
00:15:30,308 --> 00:15:31,267
No?

194
00:15:31,427 --> 00:15:33,347
- No, man. I bought these.
- You bought 'em?

195
00:15:33,508 --> 00:15:35,027
- Yeah.
- You a hustler, all right.

196
00:15:35,188 --> 00:15:36,147
Yeah.

197
00:15:36,428 --> 00:15:39,908
Fuck! Hustler hustlin'.
What size are you, 10? Big man?

198
00:15:40,068 --> 00:15:41,868
Let me check them boots out.
Cop 'em over.

199
00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:43,308
No, man. I'm only an 8.

200
00:15:43,469 --> 00:15:46,308
What the fuck you mean,
you is only an 8? Don't look like no 8!

201
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,189
- You fucking lying to my boy?
- Don't look like a fucking 8 to me!

202
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,589
All right, man.

203
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,909
Come on, man.
Don't be a bitch, man.

204
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,350
- They are nice-ass boots.
- Whoo-hee!

205
00:15:59,511 --> 00:16:01,910
Yeah. I lookin' fresh to death.
You feeling me?

206
00:16:02,071 --> 00:16:04,550
- Man, fresh as fuck.
- How am I looking, cuz?

207
00:16:04,712 --> 00:16:05,630
Nice. Nice, cuz.

208
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:07,630
- How am I looking?
- They look good, man...

209
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:08,951
They're nice-ass boots.

210
00:16:09,112 --> 00:16:12,031
- Can I have it back now?
- Just feeling it out. They're comfy.

211
00:16:12,192 --> 00:16:14,032
- Let me see that other one.
- Try that shit.

212
00:16:16,832 --> 00:16:18,272
I'm gonna try that.

213
00:16:19,433 --> 00:16:21,272
It's all good, man.
It's all good. You feeling me?

214
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:23,752
Fuck, they're real nice, bro,
but fuck, too big for me, man.

215
00:16:23,914 --> 00:16:26,113
Let me check that.
Let me try both of them on at once.

216
00:16:26,273 --> 00:16:27,833
Now that they're on my feet,

217
00:16:27,994 --> 00:16:30,673
I don't really feel like
taking them off.

218
00:16:30,834 --> 00:16:32,913
They're too comfy. Plus, I'm fresh.
You know what I mean?

219
00:16:33,074 --> 00:16:35,434
Some boots right there,
they ain't tricking. They're nice.

220
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:37,514
Don't take no offence,
you know what I mean?

221
00:16:37,674 --> 00:16:38,954
Let's peace-out of here, boys.

222
00:16:40,475 --> 00:16:41,794
Fucking bitch.

223
00:16:46,836 --> 00:16:48,875
Fuck!

224
00:17:01,957 --> 00:17:03,316
Wake up.

225
00:17:03,477 --> 00:17:05,317
The floor's not gonna mop itself.

226
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,639
Let's do it.

227
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,080
Faggot.

228
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,920
Fucking bitch.

229
00:17:35,081 --> 00:17:37,041
You got him-
Butch!

230
00:17:37,201 --> 00:17:39,921
What did I just say to you?
Get back to work.

231
00:17:57,403 --> 00:17:58,563
What's up, Shadow?

232
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:07,964
Wipe that smile off.

233
00:18:08,845 --> 00:18:10,844
That's it, boys.

234
00:18:11,005 --> 00:18:13,164
Let's get this shit cleaned up.

235
00:18:48,329 --> 00:18:51,688
Loony.
Get the fuck up, man.

236
00:18:53,209 --> 00:18:54,448
Get the fuck up.

237
00:19:01,371 --> 00:19:02,890
Get the fuck up, man.

238
00:19:09,091 --> 00:19:12,010
Loony. You go first.

239
00:19:31,613 --> 00:19:34,013
What the fuck you doing, man?
Not in the face, nigger!

240
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,013
Shut up, man!

241
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:38,694
I swear to God,
if you fucking rat, man,

242
00:19:38,854 --> 00:19:41,854
I'll kill you my fucking self, man.
You feel me?

243
00:20:08,057 --> 00:20:09,976
Time's up.
Get in front of your bunks.

244
00:20:10,137 --> 00:20:11,297
Ready for inspection.

245
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,179
You call this making a bed?

246
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,420
Whatever. Fuck.

247
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,659
Why the fuck did you do that?

248
00:20:39,661 --> 00:20:41,381
You better learn to control
your mouth, kid.

249
00:20:43,422 --> 00:20:45,061
I'm gonna mess it up tonight
anyways.

250
00:20:45,222 --> 00:20:46,220
Fuck, like...

251
00:20:46,382 --> 00:20:50,141
You are on solitary report
by supper.

252
00:20:50,902 --> 00:20:53,862
Now make your bed properly.

253
00:21:03,623 --> 00:21:05,583
Stand up straight, Frank.

254
00:21:14,184 --> 00:21:16,464
All right, boys.
Let's go. Wash up.

255
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:19,304
Come on! Move it!

256
00:21:20,785 --> 00:21:21,984
Let's go.

257
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,064
You stay put.

258
00:21:29,066 --> 00:21:32,305
That looks kind of painful.
Wanna tell me what happened?

259
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:35,386
I slipped and fell.

260
00:21:39,267 --> 00:21:41,147
Do I look like an asshole to you?

261
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,707
Well, fortunately for us,
we have some procedures in place.

262
00:21:47,788 --> 00:21:49,827
You and I are gonna issue a report.

263
00:21:49,988 --> 00:21:51,428
And what good would that do?

264
00:21:51,589 --> 00:21:54,908
I just told you I slipped
and fell in the dark.

265
00:21:55,069 --> 00:21:56,988
- In the dark?
- Yeah.

266
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:01,749
Well, maybe a few days in solitary,
you'll come up with a few more details.

267
00:22:02,189 --> 00:22:03,069
Maybe.

268
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,709
Can I go?

269
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:09,430
Yeah, you can go.

270
00:22:14,591 --> 00:22:16,310
Don't slip.

271
00:22:53,115 --> 00:22:56,595
- Fuck you, Banks!
- Banks, knock it off!

272
00:22:58,876 --> 00:23:01,195
Control, open gates B1.

273
00:23:22,998 --> 00:23:24,838
All right, I want two lines!

274
00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:27,077
Side by side in front of the dirt.
Line 'em up.

275
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,799
Banks!

276
00:23:50,321 --> 00:23:52,681
How are you, son?
Sir, how are you?

277
00:23:52,842 --> 00:23:54,240
You doing a good job?

278
00:23:54,402 --> 00:23:56,481
I've been out of the dirt
for a while now.

279
00:23:56,642 --> 00:23:59,521
...an interview with construction
after this.

280
00:23:59,683 --> 00:24:01,121
Yeah, I'd like that.

281
00:24:06,723 --> 00:24:08,962
Aw!

282
00:24:14,164 --> 00:24:15,163
Max!

283
00:24:16,324 --> 00:24:18,003
Can you at least pretend
that you're working?

284
00:24:30,526 --> 00:24:32,725
Kill it, Banks. Shut it down.

285
00:24:36,406 --> 00:24:37,485
Lunch!

286
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:44,486
Goodyear.
Move.

287
00:24:59,369 --> 00:25:00,608
Sit straight.

288
00:25:03,929 --> 00:25:06,329
You were transferred
to Enola Vale

289
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:09,009
because you assaulted
a correctional officer.

290
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:12,250
Not 24 hours inside,
you wake up all bruised up.

291
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:18,010
I'm going to ask you for the last time:
what happened?

292
00:25:18,891 --> 00:25:20,850
I slipped and fell.

293
00:25:20,971 --> 00:25:22,931
Butch, I know you're not gonna rat,

294
00:25:23,092 --> 00:25:25,371
but our concern is
for your personal safety.

295
00:25:25,532 --> 00:25:28,291
Look, I am not your punishment.

296
00:25:29,852 --> 00:25:34,292
But if you refuse to cooperate,
I have no choice but to isolate you.

297
00:25:34,772 --> 00:25:35,731
Okay.

298
00:25:38,093 --> 00:25:40,093
Goodyear, get him out of here.

299
00:25:52,855 --> 00:25:54,294
Come on in.

300
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,975
Hurry up, Max.
I don't have all day.

301
00:26:06,016 --> 00:26:07,695
What's the rush,
Miss Biggs?

302
00:26:11,337 --> 00:26:13,816
So, what is it today, Max?
Is it about your HIV test?

303
00:26:13,977 --> 00:26:16,896
Don't worry, it's negative,
you can stop spreading those rumors.

304
00:26:19,417 --> 00:26:20,777
No, the truth is...

305
00:26:20,938 --> 00:26:24,017
I've fallen deeply in love
with a woman

306
00:26:24,178 --> 00:26:26,097
and I just...
I don't know how to tell her.

307
00:26:26,258 --> 00:26:27,737
Well, I can't help you with that.

308
00:26:27,898 --> 00:26:29,657
Maybe Sands can give you
some good advice.

309
00:26:30,178 --> 00:26:32,298
You know, I wanna tell her
so many things.

310
00:26:32,459 --> 00:26:33,978
I got so much inside,
I just wanna...

311
00:26:35,259 --> 00:26:36,578
I just...

312
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,698
You know, I wrote her a poem,
because, you know,

313
00:26:38,859 --> 00:26:41,339
poetry is really the only way
I can truly express myself.

314
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,539
Can I read it to you?

315
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,019
"She's a caretaker,

316
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:51,140
"but there's no one
to take care of her.

317
00:26:52,101 --> 00:26:53,460
"She listens to others

318
00:26:53,622 --> 00:26:56,180
"to avoid listening to her. "

319
00:26:56,342 --> 00:26:58,180
That part doesn't rhyme.
It's just an early draft, though.

320
00:26:58,341 --> 00:27:01,141
"In a world surrounded by men,
I am her only admirer.

321
00:27:01,302 --> 00:27:02,581
"The clock is ticking,
she's getting older,

322
00:27:02,742 --> 00:27:04,302
"but still no rock on the finger-"

323
00:27:04,463 --> 00:27:05,942
Max, I get the point.

324
00:27:06,103 --> 00:27:08,302
I got a lot of work here.
I think you should go.

325
00:27:09,383 --> 00:27:12,102
Miss Biggs,
I am seriously offended here.

326
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:15,222
I don't know if you know this,
but when it comes to creativity,

327
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:17,823
a subject us artists
are particularly sensitive to,

328
00:27:17,984 --> 00:27:20,663
I'd really appreciate it
if you didn't interrupt me again.

329
00:27:22,904 --> 00:27:24,023
Fine.

330
00:27:25,784 --> 00:27:28,864
"I dream she's...

331
00:27:29,024 --> 00:27:30,904
"lying naked on fur,
glistening crotch

332
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,224
tickled by her pinkie finger. "

333
00:27:32,385 --> 00:27:34,784
Enough Max!
Get out of here now!

334
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:37,384
You don't get it.

335
00:27:37,546 --> 00:27:39,665
You crossed the line big time.
Get out now.

336
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:41,746
Since one of us
doesn't see the value in art,

337
00:27:41,907 --> 00:27:43,226
there won't be a next time.

338
00:27:54,468 --> 00:27:56,547
You probably thought
I was alluding to you in that poem.

339
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:58,947
Uh, I wasn't,
so sorry to disappoint.

340
00:27:59,108 --> 00:28:00,388
And have a good day.

341
00:28:01,468 --> 00:28:02,868
Davis.

342
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:06,988
You know, man,
when you first come here and shit,

343
00:28:07,149 --> 00:28:08,708
boys thought you was a bitch.

344
00:28:08,869 --> 00:28:10,628
At least you ain't rat
on nobody, man.

345
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:12,388
So, you know, we're all straight?

346
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:15,189
- Cool.
- Everything's all right, man.

347
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,309
Thanks, man.

348
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:20,550
What the fuck is it
you've got on going down there?

349
00:28:20,711 --> 00:28:22,990
Pissin' sweat out your armpits, man!

350
00:28:23,151 --> 00:28:25,150
Yeah, man, I need to change
my shirt or some shit.

351
00:28:25,311 --> 00:28:26,590
What the fuck's wrong
with you, man?

352
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,911
Why you always walking 'round here
all worried and shit, man?

353
00:28:29,072 --> 00:28:30,831
You ain't gotta be scared.
You scared?

354
00:28:30,992 --> 00:28:34,191
- No, man. I'm not scared.
- You ain't got no reason to be scared.

355
00:28:34,352 --> 00:28:35,871
You know what I mean, player?

356
00:28:36,032 --> 00:28:37,391
- Yeah.
- Everything's all good.

357
00:28:37,552 --> 00:28:38,751
Hustlers ain't scared of shit.

358
00:28:38,913 --> 00:28:40,071
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

359
00:28:40,232 --> 00:28:41,711
- You is a hustler, right?
- Yeah.

360
00:28:41,872 --> 00:28:44,112
What you hustlin'?
So you hustlin' some weed and shit?

361
00:28:44,273 --> 00:28:45,232
No, man. Pills and coke.

362
00:28:45,393 --> 00:28:47,072
- You hustle that "yay"?
- Yeah.

363
00:28:47,233 --> 00:28:49,392
Movin' that "yayo"?
You like that raw shit?

364
00:28:49,553 --> 00:28:50,953
- Yeah.
- You like that shit?

365
00:28:51,114 --> 00:28:52,433
Mm-hmm.

366
00:28:52,594 --> 00:28:55,353
Yeah, so, uh, what if I had
some of that raw shit, man?

367
00:28:55,514 --> 00:28:56,833
You want a bump?

368
00:28:56,994 --> 00:28:58,633
What, you have some of that?

369
00:28:58,795 --> 00:28:59,754
Yo, Loony.

370
00:28:59,915 --> 00:29:02,234
Get that white shit out
for the pretty boy, man.

371
00:29:02,395 --> 00:29:03,794
He wanna get fucked up.

372
00:29:03,955 --> 00:29:05,474
All right. See you later.

373
00:29:05,635 --> 00:29:07,315
Hey, what the fuck
you doing in here?

374
00:29:07,476 --> 00:29:10,794
We're doing some big-man business.
Get the fuck out of here!

375
00:29:12,436 --> 00:29:15,036
Nice throw, you fucking faggot!
I'm gonna cut you up right now, bitch,

376
00:29:15,196 --> 00:29:17,036
and all your little bitches
are gonna see.

377
00:29:17,197 --> 00:29:19,356
- Are you shitting me, Sal?
- Yo, fuck you!

378
00:29:22,357 --> 00:29:24,477
Suck on my nuts, mutt!

379
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:26,436
You got that white shit
for me Loony?

380
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:33,477
Cut you a six, man.
Don't even worry about it.

381
00:29:37,439 --> 00:29:38,878
It's all straight.

382
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:43,878
Get that into you, man.
That's some good.

383
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,559
Oh, shit!

384
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,280
How you like that, man?

385
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,159
Is that good shit?

386
00:29:52,321 --> 00:29:53,359
It's different.

387
00:29:53,521 --> 00:29:56,160
Yeah, that's just 'cause it's pure.
Don't worry about it.

388
00:30:16,803 --> 00:30:20,802
Shhh! Just be quiet, man.
Shhh! Be quiet.

389
00:30:21,323 --> 00:30:23,043
- Yeah.
- Just be easy.

390
00:30:23,204 --> 00:30:25,002
Everything's okay, man.

391
00:30:25,164 --> 00:30:28,004
- Yeah.
- You're just tripping.

392
00:30:28,164 --> 00:30:29,963
- Yeah.
- It's all good.

393
00:30:30,124 --> 00:30:32,364
- Yeah.
- Shhh!

394
00:30:33,685 --> 00:30:35,164
You feel good, man.

395
00:30:35,325 --> 00:30:38,724
It is the best feeling ever, man.

396
00:30:39,285 --> 00:30:40,764
Deep into your hole, man.

397
00:30:42,206 --> 00:30:45,725
You feel so good.
You're gonna be fine.

398
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:47,125
You love being fucked up.

399
00:30:47,286 --> 00:30:48,245
No.

400
00:30:52,247 --> 00:30:53,286
What?

401
00:30:53,447 --> 00:30:54,887
What you guys give me?

402
00:30:55,047 --> 00:30:55,926
Shhh!

403
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:57,686
Just some special medicine, man.

404
00:30:57,847 --> 00:31:00,367
Just the good medicine.

405
00:31:00,527 --> 00:31:01,886
You love it, man.

406
00:31:02,048 --> 00:31:04,567
You feel good, dog.

407
00:31:04,728 --> 00:31:07,167
Oh, look at these!

408
00:31:07,329 --> 00:31:08,728
That's the good shit, man.

409
00:31:08,888 --> 00:31:10,208
Don't wake up.

410
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,088
Just go to sleep.

411
00:31:12,249 --> 00:31:14,968
Hey, is that your mom
and your sister in this photo?

412
00:31:15,649 --> 00:31:17,848
Damn, that bitch is fine!

413
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,729
Tell that bitch to come see me
next visiting day, man.

414
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:21,889
I'll beat that pussy up.

415
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:26,130
Yeah, you know,
your mom was just here.

416
00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:27,169
Yeah, man.

417
00:31:27,331 --> 00:31:30,330
You know,
she left happier than she came.

418
00:31:30,491 --> 00:31:33,330
I'm so sad she left.
I miss her already.

419
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:36,890
Yeah, you know,
she was sad when she was here.

420
00:31:37,051 --> 00:31:38,291
No.

421
00:31:38,452 --> 00:31:40,811
- She was looking for you.
- You missed her.

422
00:31:40,972 --> 00:31:42,651
But she found me.

423
00:31:42,812 --> 00:31:45,572
- No!
- You know, she was so beautiful.

424
00:31:46,853 --> 00:31:48,452
She wants me.

425
00:31:49,933 --> 00:31:51,412
You know,
your mom loves me.

426
00:31:51,573 --> 00:31:52,572
No.

427
00:31:52,733 --> 00:31:55,373
Your mom calls me Daddy.
NO!

428
00:31:55,533 --> 00:31:57,653
Shut up, man.
Shut the fuck up.

429
00:31:57,814 --> 00:31:59,013
Where is she? Mom!

430
00:31:59,174 --> 00:32:01,173
Shut up, man!
He's a fucking heat bag.

431
00:32:01,334 --> 00:32:03,133
Fuck it. Let's go.
Let's go, man.

432
00:32:03,295 --> 00:32:05,533
Fucking too much.

433
00:32:27,577 --> 00:32:29,016
Help...

434
00:32:31,457 --> 00:32:33,096
Help!

435
00:32:37,738 --> 00:32:38,698
Help!

436
00:32:42,259 --> 00:32:43,738
- Get on your feet, boy.
- I can't.

437
00:32:43,899 --> 00:32:45,778
- Come on, get up.
- No.

438
00:32:45,939 --> 00:32:47,178
Come on, boy.
Get on your feet.

439
00:32:48,379 --> 00:32:49,379
Come on.

440
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,219
Come on.

441
00:33:04,501 --> 00:33:06,141
Stand here.
Don't move.

442
00:33:06,301 --> 00:33:08,220
Oh! Oh!

443
00:33:18,903 --> 00:33:19,982
Come here.

444
00:33:20,702 --> 00:33:21,661
Swallow.

445
00:33:47,465 --> 00:33:49,105
Solitary Control.

446
00:33:50,066 --> 00:33:51,465
Unlock 7.

447
00:33:59,627 --> 00:34:01,666
This is not a punishment.
It's for your own good.

448
00:34:01,828 --> 00:34:04,547
Try to drink lots of water
to flush that shit out of your system.

449
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:32,589
I wait along the borders of disdain

450
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:36,750
Staring in

451
00:34:36,911 --> 00:34:38,110
Open your mouth.

452
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:40,030
What I would give

453
00:34:40,191 --> 00:34:42,831
To be within your arms

454
00:34:43,392 --> 00:34:44,551
Thank you.

455
00:34:44,712 --> 00:34:46,911
Dry and warm

456
00:34:49,792 --> 00:34:52,351
- Where's the file, eh? Come on. Oh!
- Stop it.

457
00:34:52,513 --> 00:34:54,752
- Where's those files that you stole?
- Stop it.

458
00:34:54,913 --> 00:34:58,792
Give me the scent of free

459
00:34:58,953 --> 00:35:02,273
Syringa tree

460
00:35:04,074 --> 00:35:06,554
It's final call

461
00:35:09,794 --> 00:35:13,114
Lonely voice upon a mountaintop

462
00:35:15,235 --> 00:35:16,954
Shouting out

463
00:35:19,915 --> 00:35:22,875
The secrets of a generation told

464
00:35:25,236 --> 00:35:27,595
All the lies

465
00:35:30,876 --> 00:35:34,436
Blind and riding
on the ocean's spine

466
00:35:35,317 --> 00:35:36,676
No fault of mine

467
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:37,957
Davis.

468
00:35:40,477 --> 00:35:43,878
Drowning is what I've perfected for

469
00:35:45,078 --> 00:35:46,357
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

470
00:35:46,518 --> 00:35:47,798
All my life

471
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:49,917
Hasty!

472
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,118
What happened here?

473
00:35:53,439 --> 00:35:54,358
Getting a little rough.

474
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,319
No, man, I can't wait
to dig up ditches again tomorrow.

475
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,118
- I don't care.
- Should be a good time.

476
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,399
- That's all he cares about.
- Wishful thoughts, eh?

477
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:05,240
Banks, let's go.
Good night, gentlemen.

478
00:36:10,961 --> 00:36:12,121
Give me

479
00:36:13,801 --> 00:36:16,041
The scent of free

480
00:36:16,202 --> 00:36:18,281
Syringa tree

481
00:36:19,122 --> 00:36:21,521
Crowning me

482
00:36:21,682 --> 00:36:23,041
My victory march

483
00:36:23,883 --> 00:36:26,362
The marble arch

484
00:36:26,523 --> 00:36:28,962
Trumpet horn

485
00:36:29,123 --> 00:36:31,323
It's final call

486
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:49,484
All right, boys.

487
00:36:49,645 --> 00:36:51,085
Go back to the dorms,

488
00:36:51,245 --> 00:36:53,324
wash up, change your clothes.

489
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:55,645
Move out.

490
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:33,649
Yo, faggot,
throw the ball back.

491
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:38,530
Yo, I'm talking to you, faggot!

492
00:37:42,971 --> 00:37:44,530
Look, fuck you, man,
all right?

493
00:37:44,691 --> 00:37:46,170
What the fuck
did you just say to me?

494
00:37:47,172 --> 00:37:49,690
You want me to fuck you up,
faggot?

495
00:37:50,771 --> 00:37:52,851
Got your friend here.
What are you-

496
00:37:55,813 --> 00:37:57,172
Ow!

497
00:38:00,813 --> 00:38:03,093
You get the fuck back!
Where the fuck's Banks?

498
00:38:03,253 --> 00:38:04,772
- He's upstairs.
- Thank you.

499
00:38:04,933 --> 00:38:06,172
Let's go.

500
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,055
Let's go.

501
00:38:38,337 --> 00:38:39,496
Keep watch.

502
00:38:39,657 --> 00:38:40,937
All right.

503
00:39:17,141 --> 00:39:18,501
Davis!

504
00:39:20,982 --> 00:39:22,540
Get rid of it.

505
00:39:30,863 --> 00:39:33,182
-10-99, rec room.
What the hell happened here?

506
00:39:33,343 --> 00:39:35,302
On your belly.
Arms by your side.

507
00:39:40,223 --> 00:39:41,383
Who did this to you?

508
00:39:47,504 --> 00:39:48,784
Who did this to him?

509
00:39:48,945 --> 00:39:50,344
Don't know.

510
00:39:56,226 --> 00:39:57,705
Sands to Control.

511
00:39:58,666 --> 00:40:01,185
10-66, lavatory, dorm A.

512
00:40:02,866 --> 00:40:05,385
Get to the end of the bed,
both of you, now.

513
00:40:09,627 --> 00:40:10,786
What did I say to you?

514
00:40:11,787 --> 00:40:14,386
I said no retaliation,
you fucking moron!

515
00:40:14,547 --> 00:40:16,186
What are you talking about?

516
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:18,147
You really do think I'm stupid,
don't you?

517
00:40:18,308 --> 00:40:19,467
No, I don't.

518
00:40:19,628 --> 00:40:22,427
You think you're the first tough guy
to walk through these halls?

519
00:40:23,348 --> 00:40:26,268
Think you're the first guy to ever lay
a beat down on somebody?

520
00:40:27,589 --> 00:40:28,868
Probably not.

521
00:40:29,029 --> 00:40:32,388
Well, I know I'm not your first CO,
so let's go, you and me.

522
00:40:35,629 --> 00:40:37,389
Yo, he didn't fucking do anything.
Chill!

523
00:40:37,549 --> 00:40:39,589
- Shut your mouth.
- Don't do that again.

524
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,349
Don't do what again?

525
00:40:41,911 --> 00:40:44,470
- Don't fucking do that again.
- Come on, let's go.

526
00:40:47,271 --> 00:40:48,630
Come on. Throw down.

527
00:41:12,793 --> 00:41:14,432
Oh! Baby!

528
00:41:15,393 --> 00:41:17,553
Oh, my sweetie.
Okay, Mom.

529
00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:26,354
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

530
00:41:27,316 --> 00:41:30,435
- Are the kids still picking on you?
- No one's picking on me, Mom.

531
00:41:30,596 --> 00:41:32,554
I took care of that on my own,
all right?

532
00:41:32,715 --> 00:41:36,195
Baby, I'm taking care of it.
I filed a suit against this institution.

533
00:41:36,356 --> 00:41:38,836
Why the fuck
would you do that, Mom?

534
00:41:40,236 --> 00:41:41,996
Baby, I called Uncle Conrad,

535
00:41:42,156 --> 00:41:44,356
and he has put me in touch
with a top lawyer.

536
00:41:46,357 --> 00:41:48,996
So what can I tell the lawyer?
When can he come and visit you?

537
00:41:49,157 --> 00:41:50,796
You can tell him to go fuck himself.

538
00:41:51,678 --> 00:41:52,757
Davis.

539
00:41:52,918 --> 00:41:54,437
I gotta go, Mom.

540
00:41:54,598 --> 00:41:56,197
No, sweetie.
Let me help you.

541
00:41:56,358 --> 00:41:57,517
No.

542
00:42:03,319 --> 00:42:04,878
Remove the hat, please.

543
00:42:27,202 --> 00:42:29,320
It's good.

544
00:42:30,162 --> 00:42:32,441
Ah! That's...

545
00:42:33,242 --> 00:42:36,002
And your family is missing you, huh?

546
00:42:40,763 --> 00:42:43,322
You keep on saying that.

547
00:42:43,483 --> 00:42:45,282
You keep on saying that.
Whatever.

548
00:42:45,444 --> 00:42:47,203
You guys aren't doing anything, so...

549
00:43:05,685 --> 00:43:06,605
Boys!

550
00:43:25,768 --> 00:43:27,487
...they had the door unlocked.

551
00:43:27,648 --> 00:43:29,607
We opened it up
and it was just sitting there.

552
00:43:29,768 --> 00:43:32,088
It was just sitting there.

553
00:43:32,249 --> 00:43:34,487
It was just like... like...
Watch this right here.

554
00:43:34,649 --> 00:43:36,088
Just fucking sitting there...

555
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:45,569
- Hey, give me your bread!
- There's this special school...

556
00:44:17,214 --> 00:44:18,613
Hey, yo, are you Butch?

557
00:44:19,814 --> 00:44:21,333
Who wants to know?

558
00:44:21,494 --> 00:44:23,653
This nigger Shadow
wants to talk to you.

559
00:44:24,614 --> 00:44:26,174
For what?

560
00:44:27,614 --> 00:44:29,134
Don't know.

561
00:44:41,256 --> 00:44:43,176
Harrel, could you please
close the door?

562
00:44:52,297 --> 00:44:53,936
It's nice to see everyone here.

563
00:44:54,978 --> 00:44:57,017
Let's start by grading the day.

564
00:44:57,177 --> 00:44:58,777
Who wants to go first?

565
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:03,578
Okay, I'll go first.

566
00:45:03,739 --> 00:45:06,338
For me, today is a 6...

567
00:45:06,499 --> 00:45:08,418
because this morning

568
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:11,578
I lost my temper in traffic
with a jerk at a red light.

569
00:45:12,539 --> 00:45:13,979
Butch?

570
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:16,819
- Seven.
- You wanna tell us why?

571
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,939
Just got out
of the fucking hole today.

572
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:22,179
- Good.
- Zero.

573
00:45:23,901 --> 00:45:25,540
Do you want to tell us why?

574
00:45:28,661 --> 00:45:29,980
No.

575
00:45:30,141 --> 00:45:32,580
Frank, you've been at zero now
for months.

576
00:45:32,741 --> 00:45:35,781
Is there nothing that's positive?

577
00:45:37,782 --> 00:45:38,941
No.

578
00:45:39,102 --> 00:45:41,742
Okay, we can talk
about that later.

579
00:45:43,142 --> 00:45:45,181
Harrel, can you read
what we're talking about today?

580
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:49,742
"Evaluating and rel... re-label... "

581
00:45:52,824 --> 00:45:54,782
- Shut up, man.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

582
00:45:54,944 --> 00:45:56,223
I'll read it.

583
00:45:56,384 --> 00:45:57,863
"Anger and aggression. "

584
00:45:58,024 --> 00:46:01,383
I think we all realize
that everybody feels anger,

585
00:46:01,544 --> 00:46:04,224
but not everybody can control it,

586
00:46:04,384 --> 00:46:06,944
which is why
you guys are here today.

587
00:46:07,106 --> 00:46:10,945
So anger is a good thing
if you can control it,

588
00:46:11,105 --> 00:46:14,625
but it's a definite disadvantage
if you can't control it.

589
00:46:14,786 --> 00:46:17,585
So, let's start by talking
about what makes us angry.

590
00:46:17,746 --> 00:46:19,466
Harrel, what makes you angry?

591
00:46:19,626 --> 00:46:22,786
That I'm not next to you at night,
Miss Biggs.

592
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:24,026
Harrel, that's enough.

593
00:46:24,067 --> 00:46:27,026
What kind of ass-ugly nigger like you
would want to get a girl like her?

594
00:46:27,187 --> 00:46:28,706
Don't fucking call me no nigger!

595
00:46:28,868 --> 00:46:30,466
Thank you, gentlemen,
for going down.

596
00:46:30,628 --> 00:46:32,787
- What's wrong with you?
- Frank, what about you?

597
00:46:32,948 --> 00:46:34,427
What makes you angry?

598
00:46:35,388 --> 00:46:36,547
Fat people.

599
00:46:36,709 --> 00:46:39,468
They walk slowly in the middle
of the hallway.

600
00:46:39,629 --> 00:46:42,788
They're always sweating,
farting, funking up the dorm.

601
00:46:42,949 --> 00:46:45,588
Takes them an hour for them
to drop fat,

602
00:46:45,749 --> 00:46:47,429
anaconda shits
while I'm face-to-face with them

603
00:46:47,589 --> 00:46:50,389
trying to wash my face
or brush my motherfucking teeth.

604
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:52,869
- That's a lot of f-words.
- Blame your mom.

605
00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:55,510
My mom?

606
00:46:55,671 --> 00:46:58,190
For giving you the big-ass nostrils
that look like sunglasses, son.

607
00:46:58,351 --> 00:47:00,590
This is a good example of-

608
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:03,510
Every time we're talking,
you know what it really does?

609
00:47:03,671 --> 00:47:04,551
- What?
- It pisses me off.

610
00:47:04,712 --> 00:47:06,670
One day, I'm gonna get up
and snap your neck.

611
00:47:06,831 --> 00:47:09,671
- Move those lips so much.
- You wanna test me?

612
00:47:09,832 --> 00:47:11,271
- I'm right here!
- I'll break your neck.

613
00:47:11,432 --> 00:47:14,071
This is really-
You ain't making no moves.

614
00:47:14,232 --> 00:47:15,912
That's nothing. I'll show you.

615
00:47:16,073 --> 00:47:17,552
Sit!

616
00:47:17,713 --> 00:47:18,632
Boys, that's enough.

617
00:47:18,793 --> 00:47:21,512
- You wanna fucking do this?
- Frank, that's enough.

618
00:47:21,673 --> 00:47:23,592
- What are you gonna do?
- No touching! Break it up.

619
00:47:23,754 --> 00:47:26,193
Break it up!

620
00:47:26,354 --> 00:47:28,393
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Right now!

621
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:29,833
Let's do this!
I'm right here!

622
00:47:29,994 --> 00:47:31,194
You wanna go?

623
00:47:31,354 --> 00:47:33,394
You wanna go?
Let's go!

624
00:47:33,554 --> 00:47:35,434
Emergency A-23.
Send me a CO now.

625
00:47:39,035 --> 00:47:41,114
I'll, uh... I'll come and see you
after the family visits.

626
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:42,795
Okay, bro?

627
00:47:42,956 --> 00:47:44,035
Settle down!

628
00:47:46,956 --> 00:47:49,156
- Get off him!
- Stop it!

629
00:47:49,316 --> 00:47:50,636
Let go!

630
00:47:51,516 --> 00:47:54,236
- You want some, huh?
- Frank!

631
00:47:55,677 --> 00:47:56,876
Okay, take him!

632
00:47:57,037 --> 00:47:58,596
I got you, baby!

633
00:47:58,758 --> 00:48:00,876
You are done!
You hear that?

634
00:48:09,958 --> 00:48:12,478
Here. I gotta go.
The CO's waiting for me upstairs.

635
00:48:13,879 --> 00:48:15,278
Let me see the other guy's cut.

636
00:48:15,439 --> 00:48:16,719
What?

637
00:48:16,879 --> 00:48:18,639
Let me see the other guy's cut.

638
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,319
Oh, here we go!

639
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,320
Shadow paid for that.
He's expecting it.

640
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,399
Turn around
and spread your legs.

641
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:31,600
- There's a fucking CO waiting-
- Turn around and spread your legs.

642
00:48:33,761 --> 00:48:34,720
That's not how it works.

643
00:48:41,721 --> 00:48:43,961
I don't like sneaky people
doing sneaky shit behind my back.

644
00:48:44,122 --> 00:48:46,322
Don't know what you're talking about,
but we have a system here.

645
00:48:46,483 --> 00:48:49,322
Fuck your system.
Today is my way.

646
00:49:11,245 --> 00:49:12,724
What the hell?

647
00:49:13,646 --> 00:49:15,565
Fuck off with that shit, man!

648
00:49:15,725 --> 00:49:17,045
Fuck!

649
00:49:17,206 --> 00:49:18,805
Or tell us what you're thinkin'.

650
00:49:18,966 --> 00:49:20,565
Shit, man!
You just ruined it.

651
00:49:22,486 --> 00:49:24,566
- Tell us one of your lady stories, B.
- Good idea!

652
00:49:24,727 --> 00:49:26,206
Yeah, boy!
Yeah, yeah!

653
00:49:26,367 --> 00:49:29,566
- Yeah, man!
- Oh! All right.

654
00:49:29,727 --> 00:49:30,927
Make it good.

655
00:49:31,087 --> 00:49:33,367
So I'm sleeping over
at my girl's house, right?

656
00:49:33,808 --> 00:49:36,527
And she's on the rag,
so she just wants to go to sleep.

657
00:49:36,688 --> 00:49:38,687
I got the worst case
of blue balls, all right?

658
00:49:40,248 --> 00:49:42,207
Fuck that bitch, dog.
Fuck that bitch!

659
00:49:44,929 --> 00:49:47,688
So I... I just go downstairs
to the living room.

660
00:49:47,849 --> 00:49:49,208
I'm in my boxers.

661
00:49:49,369 --> 00:49:52,409
And chilling out, throw on the TV
and I just light up a "J".

662
00:49:57,810 --> 00:50:00,449
But then the front door opens.

663
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:02,489
And who walks in?

664
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:03,889
Her fucking mom!

665
00:50:04,051 --> 00:50:05,530
I think she's gonna
either bitch me out

666
00:50:05,691 --> 00:50:08,170
or make some small talk
and go off to bed, but no.

667
00:50:08,331 --> 00:50:10,011
She takes off her jacket.

668
00:50:10,171 --> 00:50:13,890
She's wearing this dress that makes
her titties just pop right out.

669
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:16,731
And then she comes
and she sits right next to me.

670
00:50:17,372 --> 00:50:20,932
I don't know what the hell to say,
so I'm just trying to watch TV.

671
00:50:21,093 --> 00:50:24,292
But I could see out of the corner
of my eye that's she's looking at me.

672
00:50:24,453 --> 00:50:27,412
And then she says:
"Can I get a drag of that?"

673
00:50:28,814 --> 00:50:30,092
And I'm like: "Sure".

674
00:50:30,253 --> 00:50:32,293
So I'm watching her smoke this thing,

675
00:50:32,454 --> 00:50:34,413
and she's got these big,
juicy lips,

676
00:50:34,574 --> 00:50:36,813
and she's getting red lipstick
all over the tip of it.

677
00:50:36,974 --> 00:50:40,574
And she's blowing smoke in my face,
and I'm trying to concentrate on TV.

678
00:50:40,735 --> 00:50:42,214
But when she gives the spliff back,

679
00:50:42,375 --> 00:50:45,334
some ash falls right on my boxers.

680
00:50:45,495 --> 00:50:46,895
And before I can even do anything,

681
00:50:47,056 --> 00:50:50,895
she bends over and blows the ash off
with her mouth.

682
00:50:51,055 --> 00:50:52,895
And the bitch just sits back and says:

683
00:50:53,056 --> 00:50:54,895
"I'm gonna go to bed now. "

684
00:50:55,056 --> 00:50:57,856
I'm watching her go,
and before she gets to the doorway,

685
00:50:58,017 --> 00:51:00,616
she turns back and says:
"Good night, Davis. "

686
00:51:02,257 --> 00:51:04,737
You want that bitch!
You want that, white boy!

687
00:51:06,817 --> 00:51:09,296
So, what the fuck would you do?
What would you do?

688
00:51:09,458 --> 00:51:11,217
I knew I had to do something, right?

689
00:51:11,378 --> 00:51:13,137
I'm not a fucking idiot.
So I start...

690
00:51:13,298 --> 00:51:15,698
I start sneaking up the stairs
really slowly.

691
00:51:15,859 --> 00:51:18,458
And I walk into her room
really, really slowly.

692
00:51:18,618 --> 00:51:19,698
She can't hear me.

693
00:51:19,858 --> 00:51:21,578
And when I get there,

694
00:51:21,739 --> 00:51:23,738
she's just combing her hair
in her vanity mirror.

695
00:51:23,899 --> 00:51:26,978
And she's just, like,
looking all sultry, all sexy.

696
00:51:27,139 --> 00:51:29,499
And then when she notices me
standing there,

697
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:30,779
what does she say?

698
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,019
"Would you help me
with my zipper?"

699
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:40,500
Mommy's naughty!

700
00:51:40,661 --> 00:51:43,060
- Damn, son!
- So now I'm fucking...

701
00:51:43,221 --> 00:51:45,341
Now I'm standing behind her, right?

702
00:51:45,501 --> 00:51:48,421
I'm standing behind her,
unzipping her dress,

703
00:51:48,582 --> 00:51:51,141
and she starts leaning forward
towards the mirror

704
00:51:51,302 --> 00:51:52,582
so she could see her face
closer in the mirror.

705
00:51:52,743 --> 00:51:55,982
And that means that her ass
is back up against my dick,

706
00:51:56,143 --> 00:51:57,302
like, brushing against me.

707
00:51:57,463 --> 00:52:00,303
And I don't know what the fuck
goes through my head,

708
00:52:00,463 --> 00:52:03,303
but I slap her ass and then I go:

709
00:52:03,463 --> 00:52:05,703
Lay back on the bed, bitch,
and open your legs.

710
00:52:05,864 --> 00:52:07,703
"What the fuck did you just say?"

711
00:52:07,864 --> 00:52:09,904
And then she grabs me
by the throat,

712
00:52:10,064 --> 00:52:11,623
throws me down
on that fucking bed,

713
00:52:11,785 --> 00:52:14,504
jumps on me
and starts sucking on my face, man.

714
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:18,224
Yeah! Yeah!

715
00:52:19,385 --> 00:52:20,465
That's my boy!

716
00:52:27,786 --> 00:52:29,025
Whoa!

717
00:52:38,747 --> 00:52:42,587
Good morning, ladies!
Gather round the middle.

718
00:52:49,588 --> 00:52:51,428
Let's see how your team spirit
is this morning.

719
00:52:51,589 --> 00:52:53,508
We're gonna play a game
called dodge ball.

720
00:52:53,669 --> 00:52:55,628
Now mix up into two teams.

721
00:53:17,271 --> 00:53:19,070
We're not gonna have
any of this bullshit

722
00:53:19,232 --> 00:53:20,550
on my court this morning.

723
00:53:21,552 --> 00:53:23,711
You ain't no wiggers,
no niggers, no fucking crackers.

724
00:53:23,872 --> 00:53:25,911
I don't give a shit
what you think you is.

725
00:53:26,072 --> 00:53:29,471
You're a bunch of stray dogs
that got locked up in this dog pound

726
00:53:30,433 --> 00:53:31,672
and you all stink the same!

727
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:33,352
Now mix this shit up!

728
00:53:36,994 --> 00:53:38,673
Sweat Marks,
get your ass over there now.

729
00:53:40,394 --> 00:53:43,393
Anybody else want my foot in their ass?
Now mix this shit up!

730
00:53:50,755 --> 00:53:52,554
My rules are simple.

731
00:53:53,115 --> 00:53:54,594
Strike your opponent with the ball.

732
00:53:54,755 --> 00:53:56,475
Dodge it, catch it

733
00:53:56,635 --> 00:53:59,035
and do not step on the line
or your team loses.

734
00:53:59,796 --> 00:54:01,075
Ready?

735
00:54:04,316 --> 00:54:06,796
On your mark... set...

736
00:54:15,837 --> 00:54:17,157
You're out!

737
00:54:18,959 --> 00:54:19,918
Come on!

738
00:54:22,519 --> 00:54:23,917
You're out, big boy!

739
00:54:25,399 --> 00:54:27,638
Come on, man. You're gone.

740
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,359
This is your time
to get your aggression out.

741
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:38,119
Now, brother!

742
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:39,759
You're out! You're out.

743
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,280
Let's go! Come on!

744
00:54:43,521 --> 00:54:45,400
- Come on!
- Get him!

745
00:54:45,561 --> 00:54:47,481
Come on!
Come on, take him out!

746
00:54:48,521 --> 00:54:49,560
Sweat Marks!

747
00:54:49,721 --> 00:54:51,321
Yeah, Sweat Marks!

748
00:54:51,481 --> 00:54:54,681
Sweat Marks! Sweat Marks!

749
00:54:54,842 --> 00:54:56,002
Oh!

750
00:54:56,162 --> 00:54:57,961
Sweat Marks!
Sweat Marks!

751
00:54:58,122 --> 00:54:59,242
One more!

752
00:54:59,403 --> 00:55:01,122
Sweat Marks!
Sweat Marks!

753
00:55:16,204 --> 00:55:18,363
Yeah!
You're my bitch now!

754
00:55:18,524 --> 00:55:20,443
Oh, shit!

755
00:55:22,045 --> 00:55:23,204
Yo, man,
what's in there?

756
00:55:23,365 --> 00:55:26,405
Sour OJ,
bread and a lot of sugar.

757
00:55:26,686 --> 00:55:28,725
Angel, was that your dad
that came to visit today?

758
00:55:28,886 --> 00:55:30,045
Yep.

759
00:55:30,206 --> 00:55:31,725
When's your mom gonna come?

760
00:55:33,766 --> 00:55:36,326
Man, I'll fucking slit your throat
if you go there.

761
00:55:36,486 --> 00:55:37,406
- What?
- Seriously.

762
00:55:37,566 --> 00:55:39,966
When's you mom gonna come.
Is she cute?

763
00:55:40,127 --> 00:55:41,806
I don't know, fuck.

764
00:55:41,967 --> 00:55:43,847
You can tell if a woman's pretty
even if it's your mom.

765
00:55:44,008 --> 00:55:46,206
- I dunno.
- Is she an attractive woman?

766
00:55:46,367 --> 00:55:47,367
She's my mom, man!

767
00:55:47,528 --> 00:55:50,047
Would you have sex with her
if you were not her son?

768
00:55:51,768 --> 00:55:53,608
- Uh-oh!
- Are you stupid?

769
00:55:53,768 --> 00:55:55,328
You gettin' at my neck, boy?

770
00:55:56,289 --> 00:55:57,727
What's this? What the fuck?

771
00:55:57,888 --> 00:55:59,368
What are you gonna do,
little man?

772
00:55:59,529 --> 00:56:01,888
Come on. Oh!
You fag!

773
00:56:02,129 --> 00:56:04,289
Fuck! All right! All right.

774
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:06,528
Don't fucking kiss me,
you fucking fag!

775
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:09,089
All right, dog. All right.

776
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:12,689
- Thank you.
- Yo, why don't we talk about your mom?

777
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:16,929
My mom's a cunt.
When I get out, I'm moving out.

778
00:56:17,091 --> 00:56:18,290
Don't worry about my mom.

779
00:56:18,451 --> 00:56:20,491
Perfect,
because when I get out of here,

780
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:23,491
when you move,
I'm moving in.

781
00:56:23,892 --> 00:56:25,811
Into your mama's ass.

782
00:56:25,972 --> 00:56:27,971
Shut up, man! Shut up!

783
00:56:28,132 --> 00:56:29,771
What are you actually gonna do
when you get out, man?

784
00:56:30,372 --> 00:56:31,531
Uh, I wanna join the circus.

785
00:56:31,693 --> 00:56:33,612
Oh, yeah? Join the circus.

786
00:56:33,773 --> 00:56:35,652
Yeah, me too.
We'll all be in a clown costume.

787
00:56:35,813 --> 00:56:37,412
No, bro.
That's not funny, man.

788
00:56:37,573 --> 00:56:38,892
I'm serious.
Sure.

789
00:56:39,613 --> 00:56:41,013
My father was in the circus.

790
00:56:41,974 --> 00:56:43,533
He died when I was 10, man.

791
00:56:44,614 --> 00:56:47,413
He was doing a show
where he had to juggle some chainsaws,

792
00:56:47,574 --> 00:56:49,134
kind of like what I'm doing right now.

793
00:56:49,295 --> 00:56:50,973
But one of them fell out of his hand,

794
00:56:51,134 --> 00:56:53,134
and as it fell down,
it cut his cock right off.

795
00:57:00,616 --> 00:57:02,255
COs! COs!

796
00:57:08,776 --> 00:57:10,216
What are you guys doing?

797
00:57:11,897 --> 00:57:13,976
- Laundry.
- You haven't even started your chores.

798
00:57:14,137 --> 00:57:15,056
Well, on that happy note,

799
00:57:15,218 --> 00:57:16,776
you're all drawing extra work duty
on Sunday.

800
00:57:16,937 --> 00:57:18,457
Fuck!

801
00:57:18,618 --> 00:57:20,217
Butch, follow me.

802
00:57:58,342 --> 00:57:59,581
Sit down.

803
00:58:03,582 --> 00:58:05,662
What's your plan, son?

804
00:58:05,823 --> 00:58:07,262
My plan?

805
00:58:07,423 --> 00:58:10,062
I mean after all this,
incarceration.

806
00:58:12,583 --> 00:58:14,703
Well, I want to study
at a circus school.

807
00:58:14,864 --> 00:58:16,703
Are you being sarcastic?

808
00:58:17,984 --> 00:58:19,343
Not at all.

809
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:20,703
Hmm...

810
00:58:20,864 --> 00:58:23,303
The reason I'm asking you this
is because authorities

811
00:58:23,464 --> 00:58:26,464
have investigated the officer
you blinded.

812
00:58:26,665 --> 00:58:29,424
More than 10 parties of legal guardians
have complained

813
00:58:29,585 --> 00:58:32,545
that their children
were physically abused by this man.

814
00:58:33,506 --> 00:58:36,024
I assume you acted in self-defense.

815
00:58:36,186 --> 00:58:37,785
To cut to the chase,
you have an opportunity here-

816
00:58:37,946 --> 00:58:39,225
No, no, no.

817
00:58:40,667 --> 00:58:42,986
I took a careful look
at your report, son.

818
00:58:43,667 --> 00:58:46,426
If that incident with this officer
hadn't occurred,

819
00:58:47,267 --> 00:58:49,427
technically,
you'd be released this week.

820
00:58:49,587 --> 00:58:52,506
But in those next two weeks,
any misconduct on your part,

821
00:58:52,668 --> 00:58:55,587
we withdraw the plea and it goes back
to the original charge,

822
00:58:55,748 --> 00:58:56,667
which is, as you know,

823
00:58:56,828 --> 00:59:00,307
four years in an adult facility
starting the day you turn 19.

824
00:59:00,468 --> 00:59:02,227
So with that in mind, son,

825
00:59:03,188 --> 00:59:05,188
I think you're responsible enough

826
00:59:05,349 --> 00:59:08,069
to make the right choices inside,

827
00:59:08,789 --> 00:59:10,669
and then in the outside world...

828
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:13,149
hopefully,
in a circus school.

829
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:17,389
Am I right?

830
00:59:19,751 --> 00:59:21,590
Yes, sir. Thank you.

831
00:59:22,951 --> 00:59:25,470
Good. You can go.

832
00:59:39,833 --> 00:59:41,992
Where's my cheeseburger?

833
00:59:45,114 --> 00:59:46,832
Slow down, man.
You're gonna get some indigestion.

834
00:59:47,994 --> 00:59:49,873
You eating your nuggets?

835
00:59:50,034 --> 00:59:52,674
Yeah, I'm eating my nuggets.
I'm saving the best for last.

836
00:59:53,514 --> 00:59:54,714
Why the fuck would you do that?

837
00:59:56,394 --> 00:59:59,273
Eating's like making love, man.
It's a ritual, you know?

838
00:59:59,435 --> 01:00:00,834
You got your appetizer,

839
01:00:00,995 --> 01:00:02,994
I sniff deeply into her scalp

840
01:00:03,155 --> 01:00:05,915
and grab onto her firm,
but voluptuous hips,

841
01:00:06,076 --> 01:00:07,955
nibble just ever so gently
on the earlobe.

842
01:00:08,116 --> 01:00:09,635
I mean, girls,
they go wild for that.

843
01:00:09,796 --> 01:00:12,595
Why don't you skip the appetizer
and go straight to the main course?

844
01:00:12,996 --> 01:00:14,036
Well, what's the main course?

845
01:00:14,197 --> 01:00:16,076
Main course:
you bust a nut, she bounces,

846
01:00:16,237 --> 01:00:17,676
play some video games,

847
01:00:17,837 --> 01:00:20,476
do whatever the fuck you want
and then you go to sleep.

848
01:00:21,878 --> 01:00:24,437
You're an animal, you know that?
You disgust me.

849
01:00:24,598 --> 01:00:26,677
For me, the entre is,

850
01:00:26,837 --> 01:00:28,957
you know,
gentle circling the areola,

851
01:00:29,118 --> 01:00:31,357
kissing every notch of her spine,
lower and lower and lower

852
01:00:31,518 --> 01:00:33,678
until my tongue hovers
on her bellybutton.

853
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:35,237
I take my time.

854
01:00:35,399 --> 01:00:37,918
Yeah, you take so much time
that this girl's gonna be half asleep

855
01:00:38,078 --> 01:00:39,838
by the time you even get
to her cookie.

856
01:00:39,999 --> 01:00:42,599
Just like your food is getting all cold
and soggy now.

857
01:00:42,759 --> 01:00:44,479
And you don't know
what food tastes like,

858
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:47,639
'cause you wolf that shit down
like you haven't eaten in days.

859
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,440
Come on!
These are women.

860
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,039
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Dude!

861
01:00:55,161 --> 01:00:56,680
No, no, man!
That's my protein!

862
01:00:56,841 --> 01:00:57,961
You're hungry?

863
01:00:59,481 --> 01:01:00,920
I can't even get that nugget.
It's disgusting.

864
01:01:02,001 --> 01:01:04,280
Rebound. Rebound. You like that?
It was a rebound.

865
01:01:06,722 --> 01:01:08,561
Butch!
Come on, man!

866
01:01:08,722 --> 01:01:09,921
That was awesome!

867
01:01:10,082 --> 01:01:11,602
You know how old this spinach is?

868
01:01:11,763 --> 01:01:14,242
It's like, six-month-old spinach
on my face.

869
01:01:14,403 --> 01:01:16,883
That was a sweet move.
You're a jerk, you know that?

870
01:01:17,043 --> 01:01:18,002
Oh!

871
01:01:18,163 --> 01:01:19,203
Good job, bro.

872
01:01:20,323 --> 01:01:21,562
Oh! You like that?

873
01:01:22,604 --> 01:01:24,603
I'm gonna kill you, man.
Don't do it again, please.

874
01:01:47,567 --> 01:01:49,526
Look at us.

875
01:01:49,686 --> 01:01:51,806
Look at us.
Okay, we need gloves for this.

876
01:01:51,967 --> 01:01:53,046
10-66...

877
01:01:53,207 --> 01:01:54,766
Did you see anyone?

878
01:01:54,927 --> 01:01:56,286
Did you see anyone?

879
01:01:56,928 --> 01:01:57,887
Anyone see what happened?

880
01:01:58,047 --> 01:02:00,447
Sit back down.

881
01:02:02,608 --> 01:02:04,447
Nobody saw anything, huh?

882
01:02:05,849 --> 01:02:08,808
Simple.
Everyone's to blame.

883
01:02:10,969 --> 01:02:12,768
Greaves.

884
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:14,889
What do you got?

885
01:02:16,449 --> 01:02:19,409
- I haven't found anything so far.
- Okay.

886
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:27,289
All right, get back in there,

887
01:02:27,451 --> 01:02:29,010
clean up that mess
and make your beds.

888
01:02:29,171 --> 01:02:31,170
Lights go out in five. Move.

889
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:39,091
That's okay.
You just have to explain.

890
01:02:42,252 --> 01:02:44,652
Look, I gotta call you...
I'm... I gotta call you back.

891
01:02:46,933 --> 01:02:49,172
The way we tossed the dorm
scared the hell out of them.

892
01:02:49,333 --> 01:02:50,973
I don't think we're gonna have
any further problems.

893
01:02:51,133 --> 01:02:52,173
Let's hope so.

894
01:02:53,174 --> 01:02:54,292
I'd like to also remind you

895
01:02:54,453 --> 01:02:56,212
that I've booked tomorrow off
for my daughter's party.

896
01:02:56,374 --> 01:02:57,853
Out of the question.

897
01:02:59,054 --> 01:03:00,653
My wife has been planning this
for months.

898
01:03:00,814 --> 01:03:01,973
We've had five assaults this week.

899
01:03:02,134 --> 01:03:04,094
I got two COs down.
It's out of the question.

900
01:03:04,255 --> 01:03:06,213
I got people flying in
from all over the place.

901
01:03:06,375 --> 01:03:08,255
Do I need to remind you
of your responsibilities

902
01:03:08,415 --> 01:03:09,615
as a unit supervisor?

903
01:03:12,776 --> 01:03:13,735
It's my kid's birthday.

904
01:03:13,895 --> 01:03:15,495
These are your kids too.

905
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:48,419
This message was the final threat.

906
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:51,739
Don't ever do it again.

907
01:04:06,221 --> 01:04:08,461
Yeah, I put in for the shift change
two weeks ago.

908
01:04:11,582 --> 01:04:12,541
You know what?

909
01:04:12,702 --> 01:04:15,101
Sometimes I don't think you understand
what I do for a fucking living!

910
01:04:17,262 --> 01:04:18,622
Hold on.

911
01:04:19,663 --> 01:04:21,822
What are you looking at?
Get back to work!

912
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:26,023
I can't talk about this now.

913
01:04:26,183 --> 01:04:27,943
Man, that fool is pussy-whipped.

914
01:04:28,103 --> 01:04:30,223
He has no idea
how to talk to his woman.

915
01:04:30,384 --> 01:04:32,864
My girls would never talk to me
like that.

916
01:04:34,304 --> 01:04:36,063
You ain't got no fucking girls.

917
01:04:36,224 --> 01:04:37,583
Don't get me started.
All right, man?

918
01:04:37,745 --> 01:04:39,184
I am way out of your league.

919
01:04:39,344 --> 01:04:42,384
No, Melissa, I'm not the only one
ruining Grace's birthday

920
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:44,785
if they're in the room
while you're screaming at me.

921
01:04:44,946 --> 01:04:46,145
Name one.

922
01:04:46,306 --> 01:04:47,505
What, like, all of them?

923
01:04:47,666 --> 01:04:49,905
Shit! It would take me all day
just to get started.

924
01:04:50,066 --> 01:04:50,945
Just name one of them.

925
01:04:51,106 --> 01:04:53,665
I'm not asking for a list.
Give me a single, solitary name.

926
01:04:53,827 --> 01:04:54,906
- Yeah.
- All right.

927
01:04:55,067 --> 01:04:57,185
- You don't got nothing, bro.
- I got... Okay, don't worry.

928
01:04:57,347 --> 01:04:58,466
Nothing.

929
01:04:58,627 --> 01:05:01,267
Listen, I'll give you one,
but you gotta keep it on the hush-hush.

930
01:05:01,427 --> 01:05:02,666
Just give us the name, man.

931
01:05:02,827 --> 01:05:04,746
All right, but I don't wanna get her
in trouble.

932
01:05:04,908 --> 01:05:06,667
I won't tell no one.

933
01:05:06,828 --> 01:05:07,867
You know Miss Biggs?

934
01:05:09,628 --> 01:05:11,268
No.
Oh, yeah.

935
01:05:11,429 --> 01:05:13,188
What a whore.

936
01:05:13,349 --> 01:05:14,508
I knew something was up, though,

937
01:05:14,669 --> 01:05:16,668
'cause we haven't been connecting
in the same way.

938
01:05:16,829 --> 01:05:19,868
You know why it is? She doesn't like
that earlobe shit that you do.

939
01:05:20,029 --> 01:05:22,028
You're so full of shit!
You know that?

940
01:05:22,189 --> 01:05:23,829
Calm down!
It was just a one-time thing.

941
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:26,549
I promise. I just had to do the job
for you once.

942
01:05:26,710 --> 01:05:28,710
And now she's all yours.
It's good. It's good.

943
01:05:30,550 --> 01:05:32,790
All right, you've seen her naked,
so what does she look like?

944
01:05:34,551 --> 01:05:37,471
She's got these perfect,
36D titties, all right?

945
01:05:37,631 --> 01:05:40,231
And then she's got
these firm love handles

946
01:05:40,391 --> 01:05:42,310
and then that big, flat ass,
you know, that's all right.

947
01:05:42,471 --> 01:05:44,671
But when you get it going,
it slaps and it claps together.

948
01:05:44,832 --> 01:05:45,751
It's beautiful.

949
01:05:45,912 --> 01:05:47,711
What about her labia?

950
01:05:48,072 --> 01:05:49,392
She was definitely
on that old-school tip,

951
01:05:49,553 --> 01:05:52,152
you know, with the big bush,
but I still found her spot.

952
01:05:52,312 --> 01:05:55,313
I just had to machete my way
through her little tropical jungle

953
01:05:55,473 --> 01:05:56,673
but it was there.

954
01:05:56,833 --> 01:06:00,233
No doubt.
Oh, it was beautiful. Tasty!

955
01:06:02,794 --> 01:06:04,553
It probably looks something like this.

956
01:06:07,154 --> 01:06:09,274
Oh, ho, ho, man!
Yeah, that's her.

957
01:06:12,194 --> 01:06:13,994
You know what, Melissa?
Fuck you too!

958
01:06:14,155 --> 01:06:15,595
That's fucking good!

959
01:06:16,836 --> 01:06:19,395
How wet is that pussy?
It's just dripping!

960
01:06:19,556 --> 01:06:21,355
Hey, what are you guys doing?

961
01:06:23,036 --> 01:06:24,236
Line up, all of you!

962
01:06:26,876 --> 01:06:28,196
Who drew that?

963
01:06:30,716 --> 01:06:31,996
Who drew that?

964
01:06:36,438 --> 01:06:37,837
I did.

965
01:06:37,997 --> 01:06:39,037
Your phone's ringing.

966
01:06:39,198 --> 01:06:40,317
Shut up!

967
01:06:40,478 --> 01:06:42,277
Why don't you answer it?

968
01:06:43,439 --> 01:06:44,558
You did.

969
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:50,398
Let's take a closer look at your work.

970
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:51,438
Don't fucking touch me!

971
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:54,078
- Let him go!
- Don't fucking touch me!

972
01:06:54,599 --> 01:06:57,439
Come on, chill!

973
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:05,480
Yo, Angel.

974
01:07:06,281 --> 01:07:08,560
Hey, bro.
Come on, man. Get up.

975
01:07:09,841 --> 01:07:12,600
Yo, Angel. Get up, man.

976
01:07:13,641 --> 01:07:14,760
What the...

977
01:07:21,802 --> 01:07:22,841
What the fuck did you do?

978
01:07:24,563 --> 01:07:25,642
What the fuck, man?

979
01:07:25,803 --> 01:07:27,922
What the fuck did you do?

980
01:07:28,403 --> 01:07:29,482
On the ground now.

981
01:07:30,963 --> 01:07:32,123
What the hell happened?

982
01:07:32,284 --> 01:07:34,003
Goodyear,
what the hell happened?

983
01:07:34,804 --> 01:07:36,043
Tell him what happened!

984
01:07:36,204 --> 01:07:37,603
- On your belly!
- No!

985
01:07:37,764 --> 01:07:39,163
On your belly.
Arms to the side.

986
01:07:39,324 --> 01:07:41,684
Tell him what happened!
What the fuck are you doing?

987
01:07:41,845 --> 01:07:44,204
Why don't you tell him
what happened, Goodyear?!

988
01:07:44,364 --> 01:07:45,323
Fucking pussies!

989
01:07:45,485 --> 01:07:46,804
Tell him what fucking happened!

990
01:07:46,966 --> 01:07:49,285
If I were you,
I'd be calling my union rep.

991
01:07:49,445 --> 01:07:52,565
We didn't fucking do anything!
Where's that ammo?

992
01:07:52,726 --> 01:07:54,365
10-66, south main corridor now!

993
01:07:54,525 --> 01:07:56,325
Tell him what fucking happened!

994
01:08:16,169 --> 01:08:17,727
Break it up right now!

995
01:08:20,689 --> 01:08:22,448
Get away from there.

996
01:08:23,489 --> 01:08:24,928
What's up, bro?

997
01:08:26,089 --> 01:08:27,488
I'm back, kid.

998
01:08:38,010 --> 01:08:40,570
Knock it off! Relax!

999
01:08:43,732 --> 01:08:45,491
...with Steve Quailer.

1000
01:08:45,652 --> 01:08:47,610
McCleod to Quailer.
And shot! Score!

1001
01:08:48,332 --> 01:08:49,331
Yes!

1002
01:08:51,572 --> 01:08:54,012
You've reached
St. Patrick's Hospital.

1003
01:08:54,173 --> 01:08:55,451
Your call is important to us.

1004
01:08:55,612 --> 01:08:58,291
A representative will be
with you shortly.

1005
01:08:59,132 --> 01:09:00,972
We appreciate your patience.

1006
01:09:09,654 --> 01:09:11,293
Get the fuck out of here.

1007
01:09:23,015 --> 01:09:24,615
No!

1008
01:09:26,936 --> 01:09:28,415
No! No!

1009
01:09:28,576 --> 01:09:29,615
Ah!

1010
01:09:32,977 --> 01:09:33,936
Ow!

1011
01:09:34,096 --> 01:09:35,296
Hello?

1012
01:09:35,457 --> 01:09:37,136
Yes...

1013
01:09:37,297 --> 01:09:39,376
I... I'm calling from Enola Vale
Youth Correctional.

1014
01:09:40,417 --> 01:09:42,857
We had somebody admitted there
earlier this evening.

1015
01:09:43,017 --> 01:09:45,017
His name's Angel Ortiz.

1016
01:09:45,418 --> 01:09:47,697
- Well, Officer...
- Come on, man!

1017
01:09:47,858 --> 01:09:48,817
We're sorry to inform you

1018
01:09:48,978 --> 01:09:51,137
that the boy was pronounced dead
two hours ago.

1019
01:09:52,019 --> 01:09:53,498
I'm very sorry.

1020
01:10:13,781 --> 01:10:15,100
Yo, what the fuck are you doing?

1021
01:10:15,261 --> 01:10:16,940
Just fucking hold him.

1022
01:10:20,582 --> 01:10:22,821
No! No!

1023
01:10:42,904 --> 01:10:45,023
Solitary Control.

1024
01:10:46,944 --> 01:10:48,344
Open up cell 9.

1025
01:12:03,953 --> 01:12:06,072
Butch. Butch!

1026
01:12:14,074 --> 01:12:15,873
What's up with Angel?

1027
01:12:16,034 --> 01:12:17,554
I don't know.
I didn't hear.

1028
01:12:17,715 --> 01:12:19,074
I'm glad you're back, though.

1029
01:12:19,234 --> 01:12:21,794
Not for long.
I'll be out of this shithole in a week.

1030
01:12:21,955 --> 01:12:23,594
I have some...
Wait, wait.

1031
01:12:24,515 --> 01:12:26,114
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm...

1032
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,280
Who's ringing the bell?

1033
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:18,840
It's Davis.
I need to use the phone. Please.

1034
01:13:19,161 --> 01:13:20,680
Go back to bed.

1035
01:13:22,161 --> 01:13:25,760
Give me the phone.
Let me use the phone, okay?

1036
01:13:26,642 --> 01:13:27,841
Calm down.
He's coming.

1037
01:13:34,483 --> 01:13:37,162
- Davis, what's up, kid?
- I need to use the phone, man.

1038
01:13:37,323 --> 01:13:38,802
Sorry, pal.
I can't let you out.

1039
01:13:38,963 --> 01:13:40,202
Two minutes?

1040
01:13:40,363 --> 01:13:42,242
I can't.
I'll give in a word to Sands

1041
01:13:42,403 --> 01:13:44,002
and you can call
in the morning, okay?

1042
01:13:44,163 --> 01:13:45,283
It has to be now.

1043
01:13:45,444 --> 01:13:47,723
I understand
you're feeling a little homesick,

1044
01:13:47,884 --> 01:13:49,123
but it's 3:00 in the morning.

1045
01:13:51,564 --> 01:13:53,404
I need to talk to my mother.

1046
01:13:53,565 --> 01:13:54,563
- Okay.
- Please.

1047
01:13:54,724 --> 01:13:56,764
Try and get some sleep,
and I promise tomorrow,

1048
01:13:56,925 --> 01:13:58,364
everything's gonna be a lot better,
all right?

1049
01:13:58,526 --> 01:14:00,604
- Please...
- Back to bed. Good night.

1050
01:15:40,256 --> 01:15:41,975
Control, open B2.

1051
01:16:04,979 --> 01:16:07,218
Control, open dormitory A1.

1052
01:17:08,066 --> 01:17:10,345
- Hunger strike.
- Hmm.

1053
01:17:26,988 --> 01:17:28,266
Dead.

1054
01:17:31,508 --> 01:17:32,628
Dead.

1055
01:17:32,788 --> 01:17:34,427
- Frank.
- Dead.

1056
01:17:34,588 --> 01:17:35,947
Dead.

1057
01:17:36,108 --> 01:17:37,587
Dead.

1058
01:17:37,748 --> 01:17:39,988
Dead.

1059
01:17:40,149 --> 01:17:42,349
Dead. Dead.

1060
01:17:42,509 --> 01:17:44,468
Shut the fuck up, Frank.

1061
01:17:44,629 --> 01:17:45,668
Dead.

1062
01:17:45,829 --> 01:17:47,468
Dead. Dead.

1063
01:17:47,630 --> 01:17:49,749
Dead. Dead.

1064
01:17:49,910 --> 01:17:51,629
Dead. Dead.

1065
01:17:53,350 --> 01:17:55,309
Shut the fuck up now, Frank.

1066
01:17:55,471 --> 01:17:56,509
Dead! Dead!

1067
01:17:58,150 --> 01:18:01,230
Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead!

1068
01:18:37,115 --> 01:18:37,994
Get out of here!

1069
01:18:41,036 --> 01:18:41,995
Now go to your left!

1070
01:18:43,916 --> 01:18:45,395
Get the fuck back there!

1071
01:18:46,716 --> 01:18:47,715
Fuck you!

1072
01:19:07,318 --> 01:19:08,718
You fucker!

1073
01:19:32,001 --> 01:19:34,200
Sit the fuck down!
What the fuck are you doing?

1074
01:19:34,361 --> 01:19:35,840
Back off me!

1075
01:19:41,882 --> 01:19:44,201
How about you,
you motherfucker?

1076
01:19:46,122 --> 01:19:48,962
Sands to Control.
I want a permanent lockdown now.

1077
01:19:49,122 --> 01:19:51,482
I want you to neutralize this
in five minutes!

1078
01:19:51,643 --> 01:19:54,723
- Sands, we don't have to do this!
- Goodyear, there's no "we"!

1079
01:19:54,883 --> 01:19:57,082
I make the decisions around here!
You got that?

1080
01:19:59,004 --> 01:20:01,643
Get out of here!
Let's go!

1081
01:20:19,687 --> 01:20:21,326
Hey!

1082
01:20:23,647 --> 01:20:26,406
You pussy!
Fucking bitches!

1083
01:21:26,054 --> 01:21:29,173
- Ow!
- Butch! Follow me!

1084
01:21:41,775 --> 01:21:42,774
Butch.

1085
01:21:43,575 --> 01:21:44,614
What, man?

1086
01:21:47,016 --> 01:21:48,574
Let's fucking go, man!

1087
01:22:47,782 --> 01:22:49,101
No, no!

1088
01:22:49,262 --> 01:22:50,221
Fuck! No!

1089
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:52,702
Oh, fuck! No!

1090
01:22:53,103 --> 01:22:54,062
Fuck!

1091
01:22:55,183 --> 01:22:56,982
Oh! No!
