1
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:48,190
He wasn't greedy
it's like he knew when to give up

2
00:03:48,493 --> 00:03:51,189
if he'd been more aggressive

3
00:03:51,363 --> 00:03:55,697
he could've been president
maybe even lived longer

4
00:03:56,168 --> 00:04:00,901
with him gone, though
my life is a lot easier

5
00:04:01,206 --> 00:04:05,199
I sometimes feel guilty that
he's not here to share the fun

6
00:04:05,944 --> 00:04:09,311
everything was half measures
his job, the family

7
00:04:10,148 --> 00:04:14,084
well, he had his fun
so cheers

8
00:04:14,352 --> 00:04:16,752
I saw you two going to play golf

9
00:04:17,823 --> 00:04:19,347
did you?

10
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:23,320
My husband really liked Hiroshi
very much

11
00:04:24,095 --> 00:04:26,188
you were so honest and modest

12
00:04:26,731 --> 00:04:28,255
just a country boy

13
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,793
your father died young
didn't he, Hiroshi?

14
00:04:33,572 --> 00:04:37,235
Yes, I was five, so I don't remember
what he looked like

15
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:41,873
I rather envy you
my father lived to 98 years old

16
00:04:42,113 --> 00:04:44,308
we got sick of the sight of each other

17
00:04:48,753 --> 00:04:51,051
Mitsuru, have you fed them?

18
00:04:51,423 --> 00:04:52,321
Not yet?

19
00:04:52,524 --> 00:04:53,923
You want to feed them with daddy?

20
00:04:55,727 --> 00:04:57,319
I'll help you

21
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:05,770
excuse us

22
00:05:12,444 --> 00:05:15,971
it's a silly hobby
keeping chickens like that

23
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:21,148
as he said himself
he's a country boy

24
00:05:39,271 --> 00:05:40,966
Mitsuru, here

25
00:05:48,413 --> 00:05:50,142
let me in there

26
00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:58,380
look, a freshly laid egg

27
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:03,183
it's spring, that's when they
lay a lot of eggs

28
00:06:03,895 --> 00:06:05,556
little chicks will hatch

29
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,956
chicks?

30
00:06:07,132 --> 00:06:11,592
Then they'll grow up and lay more eggs

31
00:06:11,903 --> 00:06:13,996
they're nice and warm

32
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,242
I've never chanted sutras
to hens before

33
00:06:26,551 --> 00:06:28,712
a little souvenir for you

34
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,953
they're delicious
not like supermarket eggs

35
00:06:32,857 --> 00:06:34,950
well, thank you very much

36
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:37,758
I'll wrap them for you

37
00:06:37,963 --> 00:06:38,952
thank you

38
00:06:40,465 --> 00:06:44,595
I've stayed far too long
I really must go now

39
00:06:44,903 --> 00:06:46,768
we appreciate your prayers

40
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,621
why don't we sing a song for
father in heaven?

41
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:19,737
When I first put to sea
as a sailor man

42
00:07:21,806 --> 00:07:26,436
the mast was smashed
and the sails all torn

43
00:07:26,978 --> 00:07:31,711
mighty waves washed over
the wooden deck

44
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:36,314
but I'll not be troubled
if it's here that I die

45
00:07:36,688 --> 00:07:40,556
awaiting me is my
lovely bride

46
00:07:41,593 --> 00:07:45,085
and my beloved parents
who await me still

47
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:03,294
more pills?

48
00:10:04,903 --> 00:10:08,395
Do you think I should go and
see a psychiatrist

49
00:10:09,474 --> 00:10:10,736
trouble sleeping again?

50
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:12,374
No, not really

51
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:17,172
I dreamed I was pregnant

52
00:10:19,217 --> 00:10:20,149
that's not funny

53
00:10:21,786 --> 00:10:23,686
it was just a dream

54
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,488
good morning

55
00:10:30,595 --> 00:10:32,062
you think too much

56
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,468
I'd better get going

57
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:41,031
take care

58
00:10:41,873 --> 00:10:43,067
see you later

59
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,339
you're up early today

60
00:10:48,413 --> 00:10:51,610
come on, let's go and see
your father off

61
00:10:57,522 --> 00:11:00,889
it's good buy
trust me, please

62
00:11:02,026 --> 00:11:03,015
I beg your pardon?

63
00:11:03,228 --> 00:11:09,724
Something less risky?
Maybe convertible debentures?

64
00:11:13,004 --> 00:11:14,596
Oh, really?

65
00:11:17,242 --> 00:11:23,408
My sales are way down
I need your business

66
00:11:27,685 --> 00:11:28,845
you could help me out...

67
00:11:29,087 --> 00:11:30,577
I see
certainly

68
00:11:30,822 --> 00:11:33,757
I'll set it up for you
thank you. Bye

69
00:11:39,597 --> 00:11:42,122
I made that man a millionaire!

70
00:11:43,635 --> 00:11:47,799
The buyers are getting a lot smarter

71
00:11:48,873 --> 00:11:53,242
no, our company is losing
their trust

72
00:11:54,712 --> 00:11:58,808
hello?
Nirazaki from Nippo security

73
00:11:59,484 --> 00:12:01,315
yes, I've got an excellent buy for you

74
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:14,225
Moodys are downgrading us
it'll be in the newspapers soon

75
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,067
that's the end of our company

76
00:12:22,807 --> 00:12:25,571
it'll take more than that

77
00:12:28,513 --> 00:12:30,708
are you dreaming?

78
00:12:31,883 --> 00:12:37,082
They're already drafting articles
about our bankruptcy

79
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:44,460
your brain only works at the office

80
00:12:45,897 --> 00:12:49,162
do you ever talk to outsiders?

81
00:12:53,271 --> 00:12:58,834
No point in competing at a
company that's going down the tubes

82
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:04,505
I don't think it'll fail

83
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,983
you're living the past

84
00:13:09,821 --> 00:13:12,483
even banks are failing

85
00:13:13,491 --> 00:13:18,656
look, we're in the same
financial sector

86
00:13:19,097 --> 00:13:24,763
in this condition, who's going
to buy our recommendations?

87
00:13:25,003 --> 00:13:29,372
Everyone's clawing like crazy
to get out

88
00:13:31,242 --> 00:13:37,010
central bank won't intervene
better start practicing crowd control

89
00:13:45,223 --> 00:13:46,918
how's Mizuho?

90
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,217
What a question

91
00:13:50,561 --> 00:13:56,227
she's from a good family
she relies on you, so get it together

92
00:13:57,068 --> 00:13:59,593
why should you care?

93
00:14:03,474 --> 00:14:05,965
To tell the truth

94
00:14:06,611 --> 00:14:09,011
I've found a new job

95
00:14:13,317 --> 00:14:15,478
that was quick

96
00:14:16,087 --> 00:14:18,248
no, you're just too slow

97
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,525
what about your clients?

98
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:33,801
In days we'll be out in the street
no time for them

99
00:14:40,044 --> 00:14:42,638
think about your future

100
00:14:43,314 --> 00:14:44,747
no, I really mean it

101
00:15:34,265 --> 00:15:35,960
is that you, Hiroshi?

102
00:15:37,935 --> 00:15:39,266
Is your name Hiroshi?

103
00:15:39,403 --> 00:15:41,394
Yes...
what can I do for you?

104
00:15:41,672 --> 00:15:43,264
I knew it was you!

105
00:15:46,244 --> 00:15:48,405
You remember me?

106
00:15:52,316 --> 00:15:54,409
You don't, do you?

107
00:15:56,587 --> 00:15:58,020
I guess I can't blame you

108
00:15:58,256 --> 00:16:00,952
you were only five at the time

109
00:16:01,626 --> 00:16:04,117
but I can still see traces of
you as a boy

110
00:16:05,696 --> 00:16:12,693
you're looking good

111
00:16:15,706 --> 00:16:20,837
I've been so eager to see you
I really missed you

112
00:16:21,045 --> 00:16:22,706
sorry
I don't recall you

113
00:16:22,914 --> 00:16:24,779
I'm Sasaichi Hamaguchi!

114
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,915
Don't you recognize your own
father's name?

115
00:16:28,152 --> 00:16:29,141
My father?!

116
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,211
My father died a long time ago

117
00:16:33,491 --> 00:16:35,322
Kimiyo told you that, eh?

118
00:16:43,801 --> 00:16:47,567
I was wrong to
abandon you like that

119
00:16:48,372 --> 00:16:52,103
I often thought of
coming back to see you

120
00:16:54,478 --> 00:16:56,207
just never found the chance

121
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,814
what was your name again?

122
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:03,987
Sasaichi Hamaguchi

123
00:17:07,391 --> 00:17:10,883
I remember mother did tell me that

124
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:20,296
I searched everywhere and now
I've found you. Good!

125
00:17:22,506 --> 00:17:24,872
Can you put me up tonight?

126
00:17:25,076 --> 00:17:28,637
Look, it's all so sudden
I can hardly believe it

127
00:17:29,513 --> 00:17:30,844
I don't blame you

128
00:17:31,983 --> 00:17:34,713
I've got so much to tell you
you'll soon come around

129
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:37,444
let's have a heart to heart

130
00:17:38,956 --> 00:17:44,258
just you and me, son

131
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,164
sure...

132
00:17:58,242 --> 00:18:03,373
it's strange, he was supposed
to have died ages ago

133
00:18:03,848 --> 00:18:07,807
that's what they said when
you got married

134
00:18:09,887 --> 00:18:11,252
I'll go that

135
00:18:11,622 --> 00:18:12,884
I want to hear, too

136
00:18:13,357 --> 00:18:16,622
you were about 5 years old
at the time

137
00:18:16,894 --> 00:18:20,295
my business went bust
and I was heavily in debt

138
00:18:21,899 --> 00:18:26,359
to stop them getting
the money from Kimiyo,

139
00:18:26,604 --> 00:18:28,538
we got a divorce

140
00:18:29,607 --> 00:18:33,839
these days I sell fishing gear
down in Amasaki

141
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:39,441
as I got older, I began to
worry about you

142
00:18:40,851 --> 00:18:43,945
how did you find out
where I live?

143
00:18:45,656 --> 00:18:50,355
Your mother had told
her parents about you

144
00:18:50,928 --> 00:18:55,160
how you graduated and
married into a good family

145
00:18:55,433 --> 00:18:58,368
I had a private detective
search for you

146
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:02,569
that was five years ago

147
00:19:03,574 --> 00:19:05,201
five years ago?

148
00:19:06,477 --> 00:19:09,037
So you've know all this time?

149
00:19:11,816 --> 00:19:15,616
I was happy to hear you
were alive and doing well

150
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,380
why didn't you contact me then?

151
00:19:20,691 --> 00:19:24,183
Knowing you were doing well
was enough for me

152
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,127
I'll get you a glass

153
00:19:28,899 --> 00:19:29,797
ice, too

154
00:19:30,034 --> 00:19:32,559
so I closed down my shop

155
00:19:33,237 --> 00:19:38,004
I came to Tokyo
I was eager to see you

156
00:19:40,745 --> 00:19:44,977
it'll be here a week
can I stay till then?

157
00:19:46,117 --> 00:19:47,049
Daddy

158
00:19:47,618 --> 00:19:51,179
Mizuho come get him
and you get into bed

159
00:19:51,956 --> 00:19:53,480
got a son, have you?

160
00:19:53,824 --> 00:19:54,756
This is just too much

161
00:20:07,772 --> 00:20:11,264
never thought I'd be sitting
here drinking with my boy

162
00:20:19,817 --> 00:20:20,841
delicious

163
00:20:44,074 --> 00:20:45,871
is he staying the night?

164
00:20:46,844 --> 00:20:51,178
I can hardly throw him
out into the street

165
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:59,585
is he really your father?
You told me he was dead

166
00:21:01,358 --> 00:21:03,189
that's what I thought

167
00:21:09,967 --> 00:21:11,332
but one thing...

168
00:21:13,504 --> 00:21:18,464
mother sometimes changed her story
after she'd had a drink

169
00:21:21,045 --> 00:21:22,307
what do you mean?

170
00:21:27,251 --> 00:21:29,845
He is your father, isn't he?

171
00:21:33,357 --> 00:21:34,619
I really don't know

172
00:21:37,828 --> 00:21:42,788
you don't know?
Then what should I do?

173
00:21:48,105 --> 00:21:50,005
Again, I don't know

174
00:21:55,012 --> 00:21:58,971
I have trouble comprehending
he's my father

175
00:22:20,838 --> 00:22:22,999
I need time to think it over

176
00:23:17,294 --> 00:23:19,785
I can't believe it!

177
00:23:22,366 --> 00:23:24,391
For me?
Thank you!

178
00:23:24,635 --> 00:23:27,126
Miss me?
Of course I did

179
00:23:27,338 --> 00:23:30,933
it's getting harder to get
a full truckload

180
00:23:31,342 --> 00:23:34,937
of course he's not your father!

181
00:23:36,513 --> 00:23:37,707
Then who is he?

182
00:23:39,717 --> 00:23:43,983
Ignore him
he's just there to sponge off you

183
00:23:44,521 --> 00:23:46,682
my bill
thank you

184
00:23:49,827 --> 00:23:52,955
he'll stay forever if you let him

185
00:23:53,197 --> 00:23:54,664
get rid of him

186
00:24:30,834 --> 00:24:33,894
he's a practical man
not like Hiroshi

187
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,473
is he really Hiroshi's father?

188
00:24:39,343 --> 00:24:42,403
I should ask him to repair
the sliding door

189
00:24:47,851 --> 00:24:50,979
watch out for the thorns

190
00:24:51,355 --> 00:24:53,448
my hands can take it

191
00:24:54,525 --> 00:24:58,359
at this time of year the branches
are very flexible

192
00:25:00,431 --> 00:25:06,063
cut them now and they'll shoot
new branches and buds

193
00:25:08,305 --> 00:25:10,967
bantams, aren't they?

194
00:25:11,341 --> 00:25:13,741
No, they're hens

195
00:25:14,545 --> 00:25:16,240
Hiroshi keeps them?

196
00:25:20,684 --> 00:25:23,278
He hated them when he was a kid

197
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:49,771
why is he suddenly so eager
to see you now?

198
00:25:51,648 --> 00:25:55,550
I heard he was shacked up
with a woman in Amasaki

199
00:25:56,487 --> 00:25:57,715
you knew all along?

200
00:26:00,824 --> 00:26:02,815
The folks in my hometown...

201
00:26:03,827 --> 00:26:07,388
were kind enough to tell me

202
00:26:11,001 --> 00:26:15,870
so... he really is my father

203
00:26:18,575 --> 00:26:22,443
looks like he believes you're
his son, too

204
00:26:24,181 --> 00:26:25,478
what does that mean?

205
00:26:25,983 --> 00:26:27,644
Just forget it

206
00:26:27,885 --> 00:26:32,083
have nothing to do with him

207
00:26:32,289 --> 00:26:33,881
mother, Shige should leave

208
00:26:37,427 --> 00:26:40,396
you've lost weight
are you eating properly?

209
00:26:40,631 --> 00:26:42,428
Of course I am

210
00:26:43,867 --> 00:26:45,266
wake up!

211
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:50,328
Shige!
It's time to head out

212
00:26:50,574 --> 00:26:52,098
thanks for reminding me

213
00:26:52,376 --> 00:26:53,570
take care

214
00:26:55,879 --> 00:26:57,369
look...

215
00:26:57,648 --> 00:26:59,741
he was absolutely hopeless

216
00:27:01,051 --> 00:27:04,646
he took half measures
he was a quitter

217
00:27:05,355 --> 00:27:09,121
he started out as a deckhand
on a freighter

218
00:27:10,093 --> 00:27:13,085
then he became an auto-mechanic

219
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:17,892
after that he borrowed money
to buy a fishing boat

220
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:29,402
he never stuck to any one thing
for very long

221
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,544
he was heavily in debt

222
00:27:32,783 --> 00:27:36,549
he wanted to use my money
so I divorced him

223
00:27:36,887 --> 00:27:38,855
then he went missing

224
00:27:43,093 --> 00:27:46,722
the man was a
loud-mouthed braggart

225
00:27:47,364 --> 00:27:50,527
a woman chaser and
a big spender

226
00:27:51,268 --> 00:27:53,998
no redeeming virtues at all

227
00:27:54,271 --> 00:27:58,503
so you killed him off and
told me he died?

228
00:27:58,775 --> 00:28:00,003
Forget that

229
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:03,245
don't get involved with him

230
00:28:03,547 --> 00:28:09,042
he'll only create problems with
Mizuho and her mother

231
00:28:11,688 --> 00:28:16,853
but if he is my father
I can't just ignore him

232
00:28:17,561 --> 00:28:21,019
you should have called me first

233
00:28:24,668 --> 00:28:29,765
how's Mitsuru? I really miss him
he must be getting big

234
00:28:32,409 --> 00:28:34,138
hi there, how is it?

235
00:28:34,611 --> 00:28:36,010
Hello little brother

236
00:28:37,414 --> 00:28:39,348
what brings you here?

237
00:28:40,751 --> 00:28:42,116
Want a beer?

238
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:43,752
No thanks. I must go

239
00:28:43,954 --> 00:28:45,182
two glasses

240
00:28:49,493 --> 00:28:53,987
you really should see more
of your mother

241
00:28:54,598 --> 00:28:56,691
don't leave everything to us

242
00:28:57,367 --> 00:28:59,062
sorry, I'm just so busy

243
00:29:02,739 --> 00:29:03,899
sit down

244
00:29:21,825 --> 00:29:23,793
what's the news at work?

245
00:29:25,295 --> 00:29:28,856
The newspaper say your
company's going under

246
00:29:30,767 --> 00:29:32,394
well...
times are tough

247
00:29:33,337 --> 00:29:38,172
during the bubble economy
you swaggered about

248
00:29:38,475 --> 00:29:41,137
you're not swaggering now

249
00:29:41,411 --> 00:29:44,710
he'll be fine once the economy picks up

250
00:29:47,818 --> 00:29:49,410
okay, I'll see you later

251
00:29:49,987 --> 00:29:54,151
but you don't have to worry, do you?

252
00:29:55,625 --> 00:29:58,856
You married into a wealthy family

253
00:30:00,297 --> 00:30:01,821
right. See you later

254
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,064
get rid of him as soon as possible

255
00:30:06,403 --> 00:30:09,702
if you don't, it'll only lead to problems

256
00:30:13,043 --> 00:30:23,317
begone ye devils!

257
00:30:34,998 --> 00:30:37,728
What did he want?

258
00:30:37,934 --> 00:30:40,027
I've no idea
but it sounded important

259
00:30:40,203 --> 00:30:45,266
why don't you put your foot down?

260
00:30:47,044 --> 00:30:49,740
He should share in taking care of mom

261
00:30:50,013 --> 00:30:53,449
the diner can't last for much longer

262
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,345
not so fast

263
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:04,353
I'm working on the franchise deal now

264
00:31:51,108 --> 00:31:55,306
begone de devils!

265
00:32:02,185 --> 00:32:05,450
Grandpa!

266
00:32:06,056 --> 00:32:11,221
Are you okay, grandpa?

267
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,827
You must be exhausted

268
00:32:49,766 --> 00:32:52,530
have a drink

269
00:32:56,406 --> 00:32:59,534
stop it, Mitsuru
that's enough

270
00:33:00,644 --> 00:33:04,080
it's over

271
00:33:19,196 --> 00:33:20,026
welcome home

272
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,458
what's going on here?

273
00:33:21,665 --> 00:33:24,532
Father was playing with Mitsuru

274
00:33:24,801 --> 00:33:26,996
he's been ever so helpful today

275
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:30,000
he repaired the leaking bathtub

276
00:33:31,474 --> 00:33:35,934
and the door doesn't squeak any more
he's been wonderful

277
00:33:41,718 --> 00:33:44,551
come on, Hiroshi
let's have a drink

278
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:02,704
two, six, two

279
00:34:05,342 --> 00:34:06,468
foul

280
00:34:06,676 --> 00:34:10,237
it sure is
yours are all fouls

281
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,426
six, one, six

282
00:34:28,898 --> 00:34:30,957
six, six, one

283
00:34:39,009 --> 00:34:42,069
do you know what he's
teaching Mitsuru?

284
00:34:43,713 --> 00:34:47,649
Gambling! It's embarrassing enough
that he turned up

285
00:34:47,951 --> 00:34:49,646
I want him out of here

286
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:52,650
so why not tell him?

287
00:34:53,423 --> 00:34:55,789
What does Hiroshi say?

288
00:34:57,427 --> 00:34:59,759
He's always home late

289
00:34:59,963 --> 00:35:02,989
however late, you must talk this out

290
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:10,371
the man reeks of alcohol

291
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:31,790
Mitsuru, how about
we have chicken stew for dinner?

292
00:35:48,678 --> 00:35:50,111
I already ate

293
00:35:56,386 --> 00:36:00,117
look, I've tried to do my best
for your father

294
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,051
but I'm at my limit

295
00:36:02,525 --> 00:36:06,962
he taught Mitsuru how to
play craps

296
00:36:07,197 --> 00:36:08,323
that's no big deal

297
00:36:08,965 --> 00:36:11,092
and your hen!

298
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:15,533
Your hen...

299
00:36:18,942 --> 00:36:20,273
...is fried chicken

300
00:36:31,488 --> 00:36:33,149
welcome home

301
00:36:39,629 --> 00:36:42,154
you taught Mitsuru to gamble

302
00:36:46,035 --> 00:36:47,229
sit down

303
00:36:48,471 --> 00:36:52,032
you remember I taught you craps?

304
00:36:56,379 --> 00:36:58,973
You've been here 10 days now

305
00:37:00,383 --> 00:37:02,442
just a couple more days

306
00:37:05,688 --> 00:37:10,990
that's no end to that
is there?

307
00:37:11,361 --> 00:37:14,228
Can you be packed and out
by tomorrow?

308
00:37:22,372 --> 00:37:26,365
I'll throw in bullet-train tickets, too

309
00:37:28,511 --> 00:37:30,638
who in hell do you think I am?

310
00:37:32,148 --> 00:37:34,207
I am your father!

311
00:37:41,224 --> 00:37:46,423
Suddenly?
After 30 years of neglect?

312
00:37:46,763 --> 00:37:50,563
So what?
A father is always a father!

313
00:37:55,872 --> 00:37:57,999
Mother and I both...

314
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:07,108
we don't need you

315
00:38:29,606 --> 00:38:33,940
you're the only decent soul
in this house

316
00:38:36,513 --> 00:38:39,880
you're too good for him

317
00:38:47,824 --> 00:38:50,019
you suddenly turn up...
kill my hen...

318
00:38:51,194 --> 00:38:52,286
what's that?

319
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:55,592
My hen...

320
00:39:13,249 --> 00:39:15,240
I got you!

321
00:40:14,811 --> 00:40:17,302
I thought you had the day off?

322
00:40:17,513 --> 00:40:19,037
Is mother going out today?

323
00:40:19,716 --> 00:40:21,877
Yes, to some exhibition

324
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,452
what?

325
00:40:27,757 --> 00:40:30,453
I'll talk to him again tonight

326
00:40:31,628 --> 00:40:35,530
when will the chicks be born
daddy?

327
00:40:36,065 --> 00:40:37,032
Well...

328
00:40:39,002 --> 00:40:40,128
what's up?

329
00:40:40,803 --> 00:40:44,466
That's the limit!
He's peeping on me!

330
00:40:45,808 --> 00:40:47,241
Peeping?

331
00:41:00,156 --> 00:41:01,623
What are you up to?

332
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:09,193
I'm sorry!

333
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:14,030
I... wasn't thinking
forgive me

334
00:41:14,303 --> 00:41:17,830
what on earth do you think
you're doing?

335
00:41:25,748 --> 00:41:27,010
Now get out!

336
00:41:28,151 --> 00:41:30,312
Don't be so angry

337
00:41:55,111 --> 00:41:57,170
okay
take care

338
00:42:42,692 --> 00:42:44,182
that was fun

339
00:42:44,494 --> 00:42:45,461
"no comment"

340
00:42:47,663 --> 00:42:50,427
such a pretty girl, that Joanna

341
00:42:54,103 --> 00:42:57,869
what'll we do next?

342
00:42:58,107 --> 00:43:02,134
Let's take Joanna and her friend
to another bar

343
00:43:02,478 --> 00:43:03,706
that tough guy

344
00:43:07,049 --> 00:43:08,710
too much of a hassle

345
00:43:11,354 --> 00:43:13,322
better be getting home, then

346
00:43:15,725 --> 00:43:16,987
yes, I guess so

347
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,258
the company I got a job with...

348
00:43:28,571 --> 00:43:30,596
...needs a few more staff

349
00:43:32,408 --> 00:43:34,808
why don't you apply?

350
00:43:35,945 --> 00:43:39,642
I can't imagine getting another job

351
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:45,116
you can
we can do anything

352
00:43:45,721 --> 00:43:49,020
we're gamblers by profession

353
00:43:51,394 --> 00:43:54,625
don't you get tired of it?

354
00:44:00,102 --> 00:44:03,071
Unlike you, I can't change
so suddenly

355
00:44:09,111 --> 00:44:13,309
well, we're not getting any younger

356
00:44:14,617 --> 00:44:16,278
getting old, are we?

357
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:26,551
You look as young as the day
you started

358
00:44:26,796 --> 00:44:28,855
that's because you see me
every day

359
00:44:29,098 --> 00:44:30,224
I guess so

360
00:44:33,836 --> 00:44:36,066
I don't feel like going home

361
00:44:39,408 --> 00:44:41,273
let's have some noodles

362
00:44:41,711 --> 00:44:43,338
that sounds good

363
00:44:43,813 --> 00:44:45,371
where's the noodle shop?

364
00:44:46,215 --> 00:44:47,807
Must be one close by

365
00:45:05,034 --> 00:45:06,433
mother!

366
00:45:08,537 --> 00:45:10,129
What are you saying?

367
00:45:12,875 --> 00:45:16,242
You know those tramps in the park?

368
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:19,204
I saw Hiroshi's father there

369
00:45:20,349 --> 00:45:21,816
never

370
00:45:23,386 --> 00:45:26,048
he went back home
didn't he?

371
00:45:54,984 --> 00:45:58,750
Oh no!
What shall we do?

372
00:45:59,989 --> 00:46:01,650
It is him, isn't it?

373
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:21,499
Really?
Are you sure it was him?

374
00:46:22,912 --> 00:46:24,709
Yes, I made doubly sure

375
00:46:25,414 --> 00:46:26,847
good grief!

376
00:46:29,151 --> 00:46:30,948
What's he up to?

377
00:46:32,188 --> 00:46:33,348
How should I know?

378
00:46:57,913 --> 00:46:59,642
Hey, Hiroshi!

379
00:47:00,783 --> 00:47:03,217
What's this?
Whose bike is that?

380
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:08,657
Stupid old fool!

381
00:47:09,792 --> 00:47:10,486
What's this?

382
00:47:10,693 --> 00:47:11,853
Good

383
00:47:13,229 --> 00:47:14,253
and this?

384
00:47:14,697 --> 00:47:16,528
Very good
what's this?

385
00:47:16,899 --> 00:47:18,025
Taful

386
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,964
no. It's a table

387
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:24,371
like this table here

388
00:47:26,609 --> 00:47:30,739
now practice your ABC's out loud

389
00:47:34,683 --> 00:47:36,310
I'm going shopping

390
00:47:36,619 --> 00:47:37,517
Alright, dear

391
00:48:26,802 --> 00:48:29,703
hey, honey!
You after something?

392
00:48:45,754 --> 00:48:47,244
We'll just ignore him

393
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:50,358
what if something happens?

394
00:48:51,427 --> 00:48:54,624
If he freezes to death
it'll be our fault

395
00:48:55,431 --> 00:49:00,801
he's just trying to make us
feel sorry for him

396
00:49:02,771 --> 00:49:06,935
he's a lot more cunning than
you think

397
00:49:09,078 --> 00:49:10,511
it's really sad

398
00:49:14,483 --> 00:49:18,647
long-lost one day
homeless the next

399
00:49:20,122 --> 00:49:22,090
he's still your father

400
00:49:24,393 --> 00:49:27,851
that's why I don't care
let him stew

401
00:49:29,465 --> 00:49:34,630
maybe he doesn't have a home
to go back to

402
00:49:36,105 --> 00:49:37,834
that's not our problem

403
00:49:40,342 --> 00:49:42,810
he'd only cause trouble here

404
00:49:46,115 --> 00:49:48,549
I've heard enough

405
00:49:52,755 --> 00:49:54,154
it's so sad

406
00:50:09,905 --> 00:50:11,702
what?

407
00:50:13,809 --> 00:50:14,833
Mizuho!

408
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:26,315
Are you okay?

409
00:50:34,463 --> 00:50:35,657
Your inhaler

410
00:51:07,896 --> 00:51:12,162
these pills work better

411
00:51:13,936 --> 00:51:15,699
don't take too many

412
00:51:17,439 --> 00:51:19,669
they make me light-headed

413
00:51:20,976 --> 00:51:22,637
the poor man...

414
00:51:25,781 --> 00:51:29,911
come on
you'd better lie down

415
00:51:47,369 --> 00:51:48,597
what is it?

416
00:51:49,705 --> 00:51:51,332
It's just so funny!

417
00:51:51,874 --> 00:51:57,244
Your face looks so funny!

418
00:51:57,946 --> 00:52:00,574
Stop it
stop laughing

419
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,748
stop it

420
00:52:06,021 --> 00:52:07,283
Mizuho!
Stop it now

421
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,128
don't laugh!

422
00:52:28,644 --> 00:52:31,477
I'm sorry

423
00:52:34,016 --> 00:52:36,814
why can't you be kind?

424
00:52:40,422 --> 00:52:46,156
Why did you have to hit me?

425
00:52:48,831 --> 00:52:53,291
Don't cry, Mizuho

426
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:29,961
hey you, foreigner!
Piss off back to your own country!

427
00:54:37,263 --> 00:54:39,952
You stink!
Piss off!

428
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:57,991
What's your problem?

429
00:54:58,728 --> 00:54:59,956
You like that do you?

430
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:02,601
You bum!
Get yourself a bloody job!

431
00:55:03,135 --> 00:55:04,182
Hey! That's enough!

432
00:55:05,276 --> 00:55:06,282
What the hell?

433
00:55:08,152 --> 00:55:10,872
You're on their side?

434
00:55:11,203 --> 00:55:13,024
You don't want trouble

435
00:55:13,204 --> 00:55:14,596
you have a family, right?

436
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,600
Stop fighting!

437
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:21,349
You disgust me!

438
00:55:24,216 --> 00:55:29,258
Look what you've done
what the hell is your problem?

439
00:55:29,867 --> 00:55:31,494
You're drunk, right?

440
00:55:32,798 --> 00:55:35,372
Look at 'em
damn useless vagrants!

441
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:36,184
So what?

442
00:55:36,854 --> 00:55:38,735
What gives you the right?

443
00:55:39,065 --> 00:55:40,274
You're one of us
why take their side?

444
00:55:40,275 --> 00:55:42,369
Bravery fortified by alcohol

445
00:55:43,336 --> 00:55:45,366
you should be ashamed!

446
00:55:45,367 --> 00:55:46,335
You should be!

447
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:52,158
Damned bums
piss off back to Shinjuku!

448
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:58,584
Use this

449
00:56:04,304 --> 00:56:05,779
goddamn it!

450
00:56:09,697 --> 00:56:10,473
Let's go

451
00:56:12,767 --> 00:56:14,141
come on

452
00:56:14,938 --> 00:56:18,786
okay
guys, grab my stuff

453
00:56:21,369 --> 00:56:22,311
he's my son

454
00:56:25,231 --> 00:56:26,344
you guys take care

455
00:56:45,433 --> 00:56:51,065
what if he decides to
stay here permanently?

456
00:56:51,306 --> 00:56:53,069
I shudder at the thought

457
00:56:56,177 --> 00:56:57,109
father!

458
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,545
Your pajamas
I'll leave them here

459
00:57:02,917 --> 00:57:04,441
thank you

460
00:57:11,659 --> 00:57:15,857
"fools cut cherry
only idiots don't cut plum"

461
00:57:17,131 --> 00:57:20,100
without a man it becomes
a jungle

462
00:57:22,737 --> 00:57:25,297
Mitsuru, I'm not finished!

463
00:57:34,749 --> 00:57:36,740
Grandpa, come and look

464
00:57:37,252 --> 00:57:38,241
what is it?

465
00:57:40,021 --> 00:57:41,989
Listen, they're chirping

466
00:57:43,358 --> 00:57:46,953
they are, too
they're little chicks

467
00:57:57,305 --> 00:58:00,536
baby chicks have hatched!

468
00:58:01,209 --> 00:58:05,805
They're so cute
I can't believe it

469
00:58:06,314 --> 00:58:07,804
what?
They hatched, you say?

470
00:58:09,651 --> 00:58:12,552
Double little chicks!

471
00:58:15,323 --> 00:58:18,850
Not "double"
we say "two chicks"

472
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:21,451
aren't they sweet!

473
00:58:23,131 --> 00:58:24,689
We did it!

474
00:58:25,033 --> 00:58:26,591
We did, daddy!

475
00:58:27,168 --> 00:58:29,728
Mitsuru, you're just like your dad

476
00:58:37,812 --> 00:58:41,111
look at them eating

477
00:58:46,621 --> 00:58:50,955
let's make a new pen
separate them from the bantams

478
00:58:51,592 --> 00:58:56,552
there'll be lots more
we'll need wire netting

479
00:58:58,399 --> 00:59:02,426
let's get to it, then
I'll take a day off

480
00:59:19,387 --> 00:59:23,448
more chickens?
Are they serious?

481
00:59:31,366 --> 00:59:37,737
Like father, like son
see how their posture's the same?

482
00:59:46,114 --> 00:59:48,446
Hiroshi, try some of this

483
00:59:48,516 --> 00:59:49,574
thank you, mother

484
00:59:54,255 --> 00:59:57,383
daddy the chicks are dead

485
01:00:13,274 --> 01:00:14,707
poor little things

486
01:00:15,276 --> 01:00:16,436
dead, are they?

487
01:00:18,646 --> 01:00:20,204
How come?

488
01:00:20,415 --> 01:00:22,280
They fell into the water

489
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:27,144
I just saw them earlier

490
01:00:28,156 --> 01:00:30,886
the bowl's too deep

491
01:00:39,834 --> 01:00:46,034
poor things!
They've hardly drawn breath

492
01:00:52,346 --> 01:00:57,978
don't worry
plenty more where they came from

493
01:01:55,076 --> 01:01:58,204
Nippo securities files for protection

494
01:02:24,038 --> 01:02:25,130
what's up?

495
01:02:25,907 --> 01:02:27,204
I'm going to the office

496
01:02:38,352 --> 01:02:39,614
don't make anything

497
01:03:01,776 --> 01:03:05,507
Mr. President... Mr. President

498
01:03:13,087 --> 01:03:15,715
he didn't even mention it?

499
01:03:16,958 --> 01:03:19,859
What does "file for protection" mean?

500
01:03:20,061 --> 01:03:25,226
Are you serious?
It means that they're bankrupt

501
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:28,398
he still seems to get his salary

502
01:03:30,171 --> 01:03:32,833
he never tells you anything

503
01:03:33,374 --> 01:03:37,640
even something as important as this

504
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:42,074
he doesn't want us to worry

505
01:03:43,751 --> 01:03:50,919
not worry? When his company's
going out of business?

506
01:03:51,192 --> 01:03:52,352
Excuse me!

507
01:03:55,029 --> 01:03:56,929
Anyone here?

508
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,792
Hello in there!

509
01:04:10,444 --> 01:04:14,938
I'm looking for Hamaguchi
Sasaichi Hamaguchi

510
01:04:16,484 --> 01:04:18,850
Hiroshi's father?

511
01:04:21,856 --> 01:04:24,791
He came to Tokyo to visit his son

512
01:04:25,493 --> 01:04:27,393
and I haven't heard from him since

513
01:04:28,229 --> 01:04:29,662
and who are you?

514
01:04:30,131 --> 01:04:32,065
I'm Yaeko Togashi

515
01:04:40,007 --> 01:04:41,031
in here

516
01:04:49,016 --> 01:04:50,540
please, sit down

517
01:04:55,056 --> 01:04:58,958
today's racing pick...
"just guy"

518
01:05:07,501 --> 01:05:12,803
hey, I'll change my ways
so please come back home

519
01:05:15,943 --> 01:05:21,245
I'm sorry I said you should
earn your keep at your age

520
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:27,513
I'm here to apologize
I'm very sorry

521
01:05:30,124 --> 01:05:32,558
she's come all this way
haven't you?

522
01:05:32,993 --> 01:05:34,085
You reckon?

523
01:05:35,463 --> 01:05:41,629
How wonderful to have someone
to share your twilight years

524
01:05:49,243 --> 01:05:51,609
I'll look after him

525
01:05:52,113 --> 01:05:56,106
we've been together 15 years
like glue

526
01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:01,117
you can do as you like

527
01:06:02,957 --> 01:06:04,891
you can drink

528
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:07,591
I won't complain any more

529
01:06:08,829 --> 01:06:10,820
I know what you're up to

530
01:06:10,998 --> 01:06:14,024
you insured me to the hilt
then put me to work

531
01:06:14,268 --> 01:06:17,362
you're trying to kill me off

532
01:06:18,939 --> 01:06:21,840
you have no inkling of
my feelings

533
01:06:24,245 --> 01:06:30,912
you've been gone a month
I've realized how much I miss you

534
01:06:36,690 --> 01:06:41,684
come back!
I miss you

535
01:06:42,930 --> 01:06:45,330
you can hardly refuse
such an appeal...

536
01:06:45,566 --> 01:06:49,058
sweet words mask much

537
01:06:49,703 --> 01:06:52,365
she turned me into an alcoholic

538
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:56,901
to get me on the
slab that much quicker

539
01:06:57,077 --> 01:07:00,308
meanwhile, she pockets the insurance

540
01:07:00,514 --> 01:07:04,712
it's enough to make the booze
stick in your throat

541
01:07:09,223 --> 01:07:10,747
I'm busy

542
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:21,497
I understand

543
01:07:22,970 --> 01:07:24,460
Alright then

544
01:07:26,273 --> 01:07:31,370
you want your son to take care of you
then stay here

545
01:07:32,847 --> 01:07:38,217
let me know when he dies
I'll burn incense for him

546
01:07:38,619 --> 01:07:43,955
this is ridiculous...
take good care of him

547
01:07:47,862 --> 01:07:52,424
I gave my life to you
I deserve the insurance!

548
01:08:04,612 --> 01:08:06,409
Good riddance!

549
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:10,841
That's the end of that
sorry for the bother

550
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:14,947
what a surprise!

551
01:08:15,322 --> 01:08:17,483
Who was that woman?

552
01:08:18,325 --> 01:08:24,161
He's back there again?
How can I ever apologize?

553
01:08:25,366 --> 01:08:27,095
Yes, of course

554
01:08:27,334 --> 01:08:32,294
I'll be there tonight
Alright, see you then

555
01:08:36,644 --> 01:08:41,104
mother, are you going out tonight?

556
01:08:41,315 --> 01:08:43,647
Yes, I have some errands

557
01:08:44,518 --> 01:08:49,421
we wanted to talk to you about
redistributing the property

558
01:08:50,424 --> 01:08:53,086
I haven't changed my mind

559
01:08:53,694 --> 01:08:58,461
it's me who set up and
ran this shop

560
01:08:59,767 --> 01:09:05,501
you can take over when I receive
what we agreed to

561
01:09:06,774 --> 01:09:11,734
then you can change it to a
pinball parlor or a motel

562
01:09:12,046 --> 01:09:13,377
you can do as you please

563
01:09:46,714 --> 01:09:50,582
he certainly has a nerve
that man

564
01:09:52,419 --> 01:09:57,118
I told Hiroshi that he had died

565
01:09:57,324 --> 01:10:01,226
he's only brought trouble
for Mizuho and Hiroshi

566
01:10:01,895 --> 01:10:06,628
to think he was my husband of
30 years ago,

567
01:10:07,568 --> 01:10:10,469
I could sink through the floor

568
01:10:10,904 --> 01:10:11,893
please

569
01:10:14,975 --> 01:10:16,806
hello, Hiroshi

570
01:10:20,881 --> 01:10:22,348
what brings you here?

571
01:10:24,718 --> 01:10:26,652
Leave everything to me

572
01:10:48,509 --> 01:10:53,276
father, if you don't mind

573
01:11:11,732 --> 01:11:13,859
mother wants to talk to you

574
01:11:14,468 --> 01:11:15,730
what?

575
01:11:18,238 --> 01:11:23,642
Are you Kimiyo?
You are, aren't you?

576
01:11:25,712 --> 01:11:31,309
Don't look at me like that

577
01:11:31,718 --> 01:11:36,246
long time no see, Sasaichi

578
01:11:38,492 --> 01:11:41,757
this is a surprise
I'm dumbfounded

579
01:11:43,130 --> 01:11:46,463
you've gotten old

580
01:11:49,603 --> 01:11:55,473
there's something that I must tell you

581
01:11:55,843 --> 01:12:01,008
I realize that you're not happy
with this arrangement

582
01:12:01,782 --> 01:12:06,685
but all I've got left is Hiroshi

583
01:12:07,421 --> 01:12:12,256
he's my only son, he is

584
01:12:12,526 --> 01:12:13,788
I am sorry

585
01:12:15,529 --> 01:12:20,296
but you're really not Hiroshi's father

586
01:12:21,935 --> 01:12:27,567
there's no blood link at all
you're complete strangers

587
01:12:28,142 --> 01:12:30,702
wait...
mother!

588
01:12:31,311 --> 01:12:34,007
But he really isn't your father

589
01:12:35,482 --> 01:12:38,645
Minoru Kataoka is

590
01:12:39,553 --> 01:12:42,283
what did you say?

591
01:12:43,257 --> 01:12:46,192
A year before Hiroshi was born

592
01:12:46,426 --> 01:12:53,059
that tuna fisherman, Kaikichi
asked you to work for him

593
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:56,597
you went off to Australia
didn't you?

594
01:12:59,139 --> 01:13:04,634
During those 6 months
that you were away...

595
01:13:05,245 --> 01:13:10,114
I fell pregnant with
Minoru's child

596
01:13:13,987 --> 01:13:16,956
I did a good job of fooling you

597
01:13:17,157 --> 01:13:22,356
but the truth is that Hiroshi
is really Minoru's son

598
01:13:23,030 --> 01:13:30,937
there were rumors
you could have heard about it

599
01:13:34,575 --> 01:13:36,202
what does that make me?

600
01:13:36,443 --> 01:13:38,536
You needn't worry

601
01:13:39,012 --> 01:13:45,247
Minoru is a man I longed for
when I was young

602
01:13:46,386 --> 01:13:52,052
so kind, a real hunk and a leader
of the young men's association

603
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:54,222
so...

604
01:13:55,996 --> 01:13:58,294
...so that's the story

605
01:14:05,239 --> 01:14:10,768
I'm sorry to upset you
but that's what happened

606
01:14:13,914 --> 01:14:16,576
so that's what happened?

607
01:14:19,686 --> 01:14:22,211
So, Minoru is...

608
01:14:26,526 --> 01:14:33,591
my husband passed away
3 years ago

609
01:14:33,934 --> 01:14:36,732
I really have no choice

610
01:14:37,337 --> 01:14:40,067
if you take Hiroshi
what's left for me?

611
01:14:40,307 --> 01:14:43,401
He's all I have left

612
01:14:47,514 --> 01:14:49,141
okay, I understand

613
01:14:51,685 --> 01:14:55,086
well I can't stay here
can I?

614
01:14:57,791 --> 01:14:59,952
Hiroshi, I'm sorry about all this

615
01:15:13,173 --> 01:15:15,073
well, there's no hurry

616
01:15:15,242 --> 01:15:19,144
you can stay longer
we've no objections

617
01:15:19,513 --> 01:15:21,879
now I know the facts
I have to go

618
01:15:28,021 --> 01:15:30,182
you just forget all about me

619
01:15:30,924 --> 01:15:35,520
thanks for everything

620
01:15:47,908 --> 01:15:55,644
father!

621
01:15:57,784 --> 01:16:00,947
Ambulance!
Call an ambulance!

622
01:16:14,735 --> 01:16:16,066
Come in

623
01:16:20,307 --> 01:16:23,174
why did you wait until
he was critical?

624
01:16:23,643 --> 01:16:25,110
Is it that bad?

625
01:16:26,713 --> 01:16:28,977
It's terminal cirrhosis
with extreme complications

626
01:16:30,650 --> 01:16:37,749
if he has another attack
he could die

627
01:16:39,359 --> 01:16:41,327
I doubt he'll pull through

628
01:16:41,995 --> 01:16:43,257
I understand

629
01:16:49,770 --> 01:16:51,101
I appreciate it, doctor

630
01:18:47,754 --> 01:18:50,814
mom, the hen has laid more eggs!

631
01:18:51,458 --> 01:18:52,390
Really?

632
01:18:56,563 --> 01:18:58,861
We'll take them to grandpa

633
01:18:59,132 --> 01:19:00,463
will they make him better?

634
01:19:01,635 --> 01:19:02,431
Yes

635
01:19:02,602 --> 01:19:04,467
really?
Yes, dear

636
01:19:05,872 --> 01:19:07,703
put them in the basket

637
01:19:16,816 --> 01:19:17,783
here

638
01:19:20,620 --> 01:19:22,611
freshly laid
just this morning

639
01:19:26,293 --> 01:19:28,056
put them over there

640
01:19:29,429 --> 01:19:30,225
certainly

641
01:19:33,333 --> 01:19:39,465
I brought some radish relish
you like it, don't you?

642
01:19:40,974 --> 01:19:43,875
And some soup, too

643
01:19:44,311 --> 01:19:46,404
don't worry about me

644
01:19:48,415 --> 01:19:51,282
it wasn't much trouble

645
01:19:51,651 --> 01:19:55,519
grandpa, a picture for you

646
01:19:55,922 --> 01:19:58,186
they're just leftovers

647
01:19:58,458 --> 01:19:59,789
hang it up there

648
01:20:02,262 --> 01:20:04,492
leaving your washing out

649
01:20:07,701 --> 01:20:10,636
I want you to do me a favor

650
01:20:12,572 --> 01:20:13,630
what is it?

651
01:20:16,776 --> 01:20:19,609
I'd like some sake

652
01:20:23,016 --> 01:20:28,010
no, you can't
a small bottle will do

653
01:20:28,421 --> 01:20:30,150
I can't do that

654
01:20:31,825 --> 01:20:37,161
the doctor will be furious and
after all, this is a hospital

655
01:20:41,368 --> 01:20:44,303
so just forget all about drinking!

656
01:20:52,178 --> 01:20:56,478
Even if he isn't your real father
he took care of you as a boy

657
01:20:56,816 --> 01:20:59,683
so let's do what we can for him

658
01:21:01,054 --> 01:21:02,646
but that costs money

659
01:21:04,024 --> 01:21:07,790
I have savings
I can pay the hospital bill

660
01:21:08,995 --> 01:21:11,623
you've never lacked for anything

661
01:21:11,865 --> 01:21:14,561
maybe so
but please

662
01:21:17,437 --> 01:21:19,428
you've never known hardship

663
01:21:34,554 --> 01:21:42,928
morning has broken
dawn has come

664
01:21:43,496 --> 01:21:46,397
no matter what they say
a man needs a drink

665
01:21:48,101 --> 01:21:50,331
that's the truth

666
01:21:50,737 --> 01:21:54,571
hearts bursting with pride...

667
01:21:54,841 --> 01:22:11,122
the pride of men who go to sea

668
01:22:28,174 --> 01:22:33,976
okay, cut it out!
The staff are furious with you

669
01:22:34,481 --> 01:22:38,508
they'll kick you out
if you don't stop now

670
01:22:40,019 --> 01:22:42,180
we'd better go

671
01:22:43,590 --> 01:22:46,650
you take care of yourself

672
01:23:11,518 --> 01:23:12,712
cover up

673
01:23:27,267 --> 01:23:35,800
I was but a lad of fourteen years

674
01:23:37,811 --> 01:23:44,842
when first I put to sea as
a sailor man

675
01:23:45,151 --> 01:23:49,918
the first time our ship cleared the port

676
01:23:52,725 --> 01:23:58,027
the mast was smashed and
the sails all torn

677
01:23:58,431 --> 01:24:04,301
mighty waves washed over
the wooden deck

678
01:24:04,604 --> 01:24:15,776
but I'll not be troubled
if it's here that I die

679
01:24:16,182 --> 01:24:17,979
that song...

680
01:24:20,753 --> 01:24:23,051
it's our song, lad

681
01:24:36,369 --> 01:24:41,466
when first I put to sea as
a sailor man

682
01:24:42,342 --> 01:24:47,370
the mast was smashed and
the sails all torn

683
01:24:47,780 --> 01:24:52,649
mighty waves washed over
the wooden deck

684
01:24:52,952 --> 01:24:57,685
but I'll not be troubled
if it's here that I die

685
01:24:57,991 --> 01:25:02,189
awaiting me is my lovely bride

686
01:25:02,462 --> 01:25:07,593
and my parents
more important to me

687
01:25:08,234 --> 01:25:13,433
Neptune beckons me...

688
01:25:23,116 --> 01:25:27,052
I really am your son after all

689
01:25:32,892 --> 01:25:36,851
as Kimiyo says
I might be infertile

690
01:25:49,442 --> 01:25:57,281
offer up prayers
and make your vows

691
01:25:58,017 --> 01:26:07,653
to Neptune
the king of all seas

692
01:26:08,661 --> 01:26:16,864
mighty Neptune
will you quieten the storm?

693
01:26:17,170 --> 01:26:26,169
For just a little while
for just a little while

694
01:28:33,906 --> 01:28:36,272
I wonder how he is?

695
01:28:37,110 --> 01:28:38,042
Well...

696
01:28:39,712 --> 01:28:44,945
I visited the hospital today
but he was fast asleep

697
01:28:47,854 --> 01:28:49,913
he's like that recently

698
01:28:52,225 --> 01:28:58,027
the man's nuisance whether
he's sick or well

699
01:29:02,301 --> 01:29:03,529
it's too bad

700
01:29:27,293 --> 01:29:28,817
what are you doing?

701
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,662
Shall I make a snack?

702
01:29:38,971 --> 01:29:40,336
Listen...

703
01:29:45,778 --> 01:29:46,904
look...

704
01:29:49,282 --> 01:29:51,216
I must apologize to you

705
01:29:52,185 --> 01:29:53,345
what for?

706
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:58,016
The company's restructuring plan
was rejected

707
01:30:02,995 --> 01:30:05,964
that means they're bankrupt

708
01:30:12,371 --> 01:30:16,740
you only ever give results

709
01:30:17,743 --> 01:30:19,938
it was all so sudden

710
01:30:26,152 --> 01:30:29,588
you never discuss anything
you never have

711
01:30:30,790 --> 01:30:36,092
you turned your back on
your own father

712
01:30:36,295 --> 01:30:41,995
selfishly thinking
only you've suffered

713
01:30:47,773 --> 01:30:49,866
maybe you're right

714
01:30:52,845 --> 01:30:56,281
did I really enjoy my work?

715
01:30:59,252 --> 01:31:01,982
There'll be no final payment

716
01:31:04,590 --> 01:31:06,990
I don't know what to do

717
01:31:28,414 --> 01:31:30,279
hello, Nirazaki residence

718
01:31:39,191 --> 01:31:40,522
it's the hospital!

719
01:31:41,394 --> 01:31:43,362
Your father's dying!

720
01:31:43,729 --> 01:31:44,923
Take the call

721
01:31:59,111 --> 01:32:02,444
we should've contacted you earlier

722
01:32:06,252 --> 01:32:10,052
I never knew if he wanted to
live or not

723
01:32:24,103 --> 01:32:26,936
my sincere regrets

724
01:33:11,150 --> 01:33:16,281
let's go
let's go home

725
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:45,479
little chicks!
This is incredible!

726
01:33:49,188 --> 01:33:53,784
He said he would try to hatch them

727
01:33:54,660 --> 01:33:57,060
and he did it!

728
01:33:59,465 --> 01:34:06,598
He didn't eat those eggs
he nurtured them

729
01:34:10,709 --> 01:34:14,304
who would ever have imagined?

730
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:35,631
Father...

731
01:35:22,781 --> 01:35:25,147
spreading his ashes, how sad

732
01:35:27,553 --> 01:35:31,546
I bet he's happy
he loved a ceremony

733
01:35:32,024 --> 01:35:33,616
I wonder...

734
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:39,930
I never saw the body
so I keep expecting him to turn up

735
01:35:40,666 --> 01:35:44,124
if he did, would you insure him again?

736
01:35:44,470 --> 01:35:47,030
Don't say that!
I was good to him

737
01:35:47,373 --> 01:35:49,000
it was such a short time...

738
01:35:50,976 --> 01:35:53,410
you seem to be getting younger

739
01:35:57,850 --> 01:36:00,216
really?
Do you think so?

740
01:36:00,886 --> 01:36:02,751
Shall we begin?

741
01:36:02,922 --> 01:36:04,685
I suppose we must

742
01:36:16,969 --> 01:36:19,563
will normal funerary prayers do?

743
01:36:19,872 --> 01:36:21,499
Anything, I suppose

744
01:36:21,740 --> 01:36:26,268
great god of compassion...

745
01:36:30,316 --> 01:36:37,119
ashes to ashes
dust to dust

746
01:37:07,386 --> 01:37:09,786
doesn't Hiroshi take after him?

747
01:37:12,691 --> 01:37:14,659
You lied, didn't you?

748
01:37:21,533 --> 01:37:23,364
I'll keep a piece of him

749
01:37:31,276 --> 01:37:33,335
which bone was it?

750
01:37:41,620 --> 01:37:44,521
I'll have to find a new job

751
01:37:46,859 --> 01:37:52,161
don't worry
life will go on

752
01:37:56,969 --> 01:37:59,335
you know, I'm quite strong

753
01:38:02,841 --> 01:38:07,039
even so
it's a long haul...

754
01:38:14,753 --> 01:38:18,189
Mitsuru!
You've got a strong mother!
