George's class was a group of New York City pimps
charged with tax evasion.

144
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:49,404
In the 1970s, Nixon became the first president
to place drugs before foreign policy.

145
00:40:57,538 --> 00:41:04,127
Approximately 15% of U.S. soldiers
who fought in the Vietnam War
returned home addicted to drugs.

146
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:11,634
President Nixon felt a need
to deal with the drug problem
before soldiers returned home...

147
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:17,724
and mandated medical treatment as a priority
to fight the massive drug addiction.

148
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:29,319
In 1972, Anti-drug Legislation
passed unanimously in Congress.

149
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:10,985
In the 1970s, a kilo of cocaine
could be processed for $1,500 in Colombia
and sold in the U.S. for $50,000.

150
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:19,661
The white powder, Cocaine Hydrochloride,
is made by soaking coca leaves in a lime,
kerosene and sulfuric acid solution.

151
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:27,669
250 kilos of coca leaves
boil down to 2.5 kilos of paste.

152
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:35,677
From this paste a 100% pure
cocaine alkaloid is formed called "base".

153
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:43,643
The "base" is dissolved in ether and combined
with hydrochloric acid and acetone.

154
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:49,065
This mixture dries into the familiar
fine white powder seen in the movie.

155
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:33,318
In the early 1970s, it cost 80 quarters
to call Colombia for three minutes
from New England.

156
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:43,513
Until the 1970s Colombia controlled
less than 15% of the world's cocaine market.

157
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:51,145
In 1976, the U.S. Supreme Court
declared the death penalty constitutional.

158
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:57,110
In 1976, Apple ©, Inc. was established
in a Silicon Valley garage.

159
00:44:57,194 --> 00:45:02,824
Their goal was to produce no more
than 100 computers at $50 each.

160
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:14,419
In 1976, the U.S. Supreme Court
upheld states' rights to enact laws
making homosexual acts illegal.

161
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:24,053
It even affected sex between
consenting adults in their own home.

162
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:31,811
In 1976, the U.S. vetoed
a U.N. Security Council resolution...

163
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:38,401
assailing Israel's occupation policies
in Jerusalem and the West Bank.

164
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:46,993
In 1976, "Disco Duck" by Rick Dees
became the fourth platinum single
in music history.

165
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:04,677
The use of dogs to detect contraband
in major air/sea and land borders
was introduced in 1970.

166
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:11,350
A dog can examine a vehicle for contraband
in 5 to 6 minutes and check 400 to 500
packages in about 30 minutes.

167
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:18,357
In 1996, dogs detected
over 253 tons of narcotics
with a street value of $3.7 billion.

168
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:04,028
Throughout the world,
customs and police seize less than five percent
of all illegal drugs being smuggled.

169
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:10,368
In the early 1970s, drug traffickers used "mules"
(drug carriers) on commercial air flights
to smuggle cocaine.

170
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:17,250
"Mules" used false bottom suitcases,
and swallowed drugs wrapped in condoms.

171
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:23,422
Cocaine has been smuggled in wigs, shoe heels,
aerosol cans, toothpaste tubes,
shoulder pads and bras.

172
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:29,595
When smuggled as a dissolved substance,
cocaine could also be concealed
in soda cans or shampoo.

173
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:35,768
In the early 1990s, smugglers
were found with cocaine stuffed
into surgically implanted buttock packs.

174
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:39,081
Early cocaine smuggling
was also accomplished using small planes...

175
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:44,503
flying from Miami to Nassau,
an island in the Bahamas.

176
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:52,845
In Nassau, pilots would file
flight plans to fly to other islands
during busy air-traffic time...

177
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:58,267
but instead would fly to a 5,000 foot airstrip
outside Medellin, Colombia.

178
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:07,526
The planes would return to Nassau
and from there fly back to Miami...

179
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:12,615
loaded with duffle bags full of cocaine.

180
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:26,212
To avoid the DEA, the planes
would drop below radar
before reaching the Florida coast.

181
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:33,302
The planes landed in North Carolina.
The duffle bags of cocaine
were then driven back to Miami.

182
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:43,349
There are minimal restrictions in Florida
for gun ownership.

183
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:49,396
Florida does not require a permit to purchase
or license rifles, shotguns and handguns.

184
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:54,985
The only permit required
is to carry a handgun.

185
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:25,349
George would earn an average of $10,000
per kilo of cocaine smuggled.

186
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:32,690
With two trips a week to L.A.
he would net $500,000.

187
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:12,813
Cocaine is cut by dealers
with quinine, novocaine, lactose
and mannite, a mild laxative.

188
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:20,154
Cutting with quinine
is the least desirable method because it
creates a burning sensation in the nose.

189
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:29,705
When using cocaine, people are often talkative
and full of energy to the point
of being restless and fidgety.

190
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:38,714
Cocaine can temporarily increase focus
and mental alertness, eliminate fatigue
and decrease the appetite.

191
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:28,782
One million dollars in one hundred dollar bills
weigh exactly 20.4 lbs.

192
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:34,872
Six million dollars worth of crisp
new one hundred dollar bills in a single stack
measures 21.5 feet in height.

193
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:55,476
In 1987, 85% of the cocaine in the U.S. came
from Colombia and was valued at $4 billion.

194
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:07,321
Many of Medellin's poor people,
paid by the cartel, became wealthy
drug carriers, bodyguards and assassins.

195
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:31,613
Starting out in petty scams,
Pablo Escobar was an accomplished
car thief by the time he was 20.

196
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:42,291
In 1993, Pablo Escobar's personal wealth
was estimated to be two billion dollars.

197
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:49,298
Colombian banks readily converted
unlimited amounts of U.S. dollars into pesos.

198
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:56,305
Between 1976 and 1980 bank deposits
in Colombia's four major cities
more than doubled.

199
00:57:57,307 --> 00:58:02,019
With cocaine money,
Escobar started his own newspaper...

200
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:07,483
financed a housing development for the poor
called Barrio Pablo Escobar...

201
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:12,571
funded money for road and electric lines,
built roller rinks...

202
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:17,659
and handed out money
at public appearances.

203
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:23,624
To the Colombian people Escobar
became "Paisa Robin Hood."

204
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:29,379
Even the Catholic Church of Medellin
backed Escobar's social programs.

205
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:15,717
In 1982, Escobar was elected
to the Colombian Congress,
granting him diplomatic immunity.

206
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:30,315
Pablo Escobar's motto
in dealing with the authorities
was known as "plata o plomo"...

207
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:36,405
translated to mean accept Pablo's "plata"
(silver) or his "plomo" (lead).

208
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:44,413
During the 1980s and early 1990s as many as
2,000 police and civilians were murdered
each year in Medellin by the cartel.

209
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:51,420
Escobar paid bounty ranging
from $1,000 to $3,000 on the lives of police.

210
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:58,427
The cartel also assassinated more
than 30 judges, the Minister of Justice
and a presidential candidate.

211
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:04,766
In 1989, they bombed
the offices of El Espectador
(an anti-drug newspaper)...

212
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:10,856
and blew up an Avianca passenger plane
killing over 100 passengers and crew.

213
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:52,666
In 1983, the largest cocaine lab in the world
was built in Tranquilandia, Colombia...

214
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:57,754
with an airstrip
and its own power and water supply.

215
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:02,801
In 1984, Tranquilandia was raided
by the Colombian National Police.

216
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:08,640
Fourteen metric tons of cocaine
were confiscated and dumped in the river.

217
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:16,398
In 1993, Escobar was killed in a firefight
with Colombian National Police at
a private residence in downtown Medellin.

218
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:41,339
In 1979, freebase cocaine was developed
by cooking cocaine powder,
water, and baking soda...

219
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:46,720
until it formed a solid substance
that could be broken down
and sold in individual "rocks".

220
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:51,475
Freebasing was popularized by dealers
and glamorized by Hollywood media.

221
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:58,482
During the early 1980s,
George was transporting
two to five million dollars in cash a week.

222
01:02:58,566 --> 01:03:04,529
Between 1978 and 1980
George snorted an average of five grams
(125 lines) of cocaine a day.

223
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:09,534
This equaled around 13.2 pounds
of cocaine in two years.

224
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:17,959
Money laundering can be defined
as the process of concealing the existence...

225
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:23,924
the illegal source, or the application
of income derived from criminal activity...

226
01:03:24,008 --> 01:03:30,013
and the subsequent disguising
of the source of that income
to make it appear legitimate.

227
01:04:21,065 --> 01:04:27,404
During the Middle Ages,
it became a tradition for couples to kiss
over a small cluster of cakes at their wedding.

228
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:33,451
Later, a clever baker in London decided
to group all these small cakes together...

229
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:39,541
covering them with frosting and
the modern tiered wedding cake was created.

230
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:16,578
Iron was used by the Romans
to make a wedding ring.

231
01:05:19,206 --> 01:05:24,210
It symbolized the permanence of marriage.

232
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:32,427
Mirtha was 24 years old
when George met her in 1977.

233
01:05:32,511 --> 01:05:39,017
She was born in Cuba and when her sister
married a Colombian, Mirtha was introduced
to the world of cocaine trafficking.

234
01:05:47,526 --> 01:05:53,031
Penelope Cruz was born
in Madrid, Spain in 1974.

235
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:20,725
Johnny Depp is a member of the band "P",
whose other members include
Butthole Surfer Gibby Haynes...

236
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:26,773
guitarist Bill Carter, Sex Pistol Steve Jones,
Red Hot Chili Pepper Flea and Sal Jenco.

237
01:06:56,429 --> 01:07:01,850
Penelope studied classical ballet
for nine years before she became an actress.

238
01:07:38,095 --> 01:07:44,100
Penelope starred in Pedro Almodovar's
Academy Award-winning film
"All About My Mother".

239
01:08:37,863 --> 01:08:44,160
Cruz won Spain's Oscar equivalent,
the Goya Award, as Best Actress...

240
01:08:44,245 --> 01:08:48,331
for her role in Fernando Trueba's
"The Girl of Your Dreams".

241
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:36,004
In 1977, one fourth of the world's population
lived on less than $200 a year.

242
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:42,010
90 million people
survived on less than $75 a year.

243
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:54,939
In 1977, the U.S. median family income
was $35,000, remaining the same
as it was in 1970.

244
01:09:55,024 --> 01:10:00,695
In that same year,
the Jung's average household expenses
ran about $60,000 a week.

245
01:10:10,831 --> 01:10:17,170
George's house had a 250-gallon
oil storage tank in the basement,
large enough to store $3 million in cash.

246
01:11:10,849 --> 01:11:15,853
George owned many cars,
including a Porsche 924,
a turbo-charged Carrera...

247
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:20,900
Thunderbirds, BMWs,
a couple of Mercedes Benzes
and a Ferrari.

248
01:11:20,985 --> 01:11:26,990
George gave his parents a brand new
Ford Country Squire station wagon.

249
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:31,077
They never used it.

250
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:23,231
In 1979, cocaine violence
was brought to the limelight...

251
01:13:23,315 --> 01:13:30,321
when, in broad daylight,
Colombian drug traffickers
staged a deadly shoot out at a Miami mall.

252
01:13:33,033 --> 01:13:37,995
In 1982, Miami citizens lobbied
the federal government...

253
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:43,418
to help stop the increasing violence
caused by the drug trade.

254
01:13:55,764 --> 01:14:01,769
President Reagan created the
"Vice President's Task Force on South Florida".

255
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:08,234
It was headed by George Bush and used agents
from the DEA, IRS, Army and Navy.

256
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:16,200
In 1985, after Colombia extradited
four Colombian narco-traffickers...

257
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:21,289
a hit list from the Medellin cartel
was made known in the U.S.

258
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:28,296
It included U.S. businessmen, journalists,
embassy members and their families.

259
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:59,327
In the 1980s, an average of 125 tons
of cocaine a year entered the U.S...

260
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:05,416
equaling, after being cut 3 to 4 times
by dealers, about $40 to $50 billion.

261
01:15:07,419 --> 01:15:12,423
If cocaine drug trafficking
was a legal business during the 1980s...

262
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:18,513
it would have ranked
as the sixth largest private enterprise
in the Fortune 500.

263
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:20,408
Paul Reubens was born Paul Rubenfield
in Sarasota, Florida.

264
01:16:20,492 --> 01:16:25,413
When Paul was eleven
he joined the local Aslo Theater.

265
01:16:32,629 --> 01:16:37,967
In the mid 1970s Reubens
appeared on the Gong Show.

266
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:43,366
The Bahamas consist of 700 islands
and over 2,000 islets...

267
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:49,121
that occupy 100,000 square miles
of ocean in the Atlantic.

268
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:58,714
The island chain, which lies
as close as 52 miles from Miami
and which stretches as far south as Haiti...

269
01:17:58,799 --> 01:18:03,594
was a favorite staging ground
for drug smugglers.

270
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:37,772
Norman Cay is a small island in the Bahamas,
210 miles off the Florida coast.

271
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:45,780
In 1978, the Medellin cartel
bought large pieces of Norman Cay,
including a hotel, an airstrip and a marina.

272
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:55,873
Robert Vesco, a swindler
who defrauded investors of $224 million...

273
01:19:55,957 --> 01:20:01,921
was in exile on his own island 10 miles
south of Norman Cay.

274
01:20:02,923 --> 01:20:09,595
He was instrumental in assisting the cartel
with bribing the Bahamian Government.

275
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:15,810
With Bahamian authorities
looking the other way...

276
01:20:15,894 --> 01:20:19,814
and the local inhabitants
being scared off...

277
01:20:19,898 --> 01:20:26,237
the island became a stopover
and refueling hub for the cartel's
cocaine smuggling operations.

278
01:20:27,531 --> 01:20:34,537
Yachtsmen sailing near Norman Cay
were swooped down upon by cartel helicopters...

279
01:20:34,621 --> 01:20:39,917
and through a loudspeaker
were told to clear out fast.

280
01:21:22,335 --> 01:21:29,300
20th century French philosopher Jean Paul Sartre
first coined the term "existentialism"
by using it for his own philosophy.

281
01:21:29,384 --> 01:21:36,390
Existentialism, a philosophical
and literary movement, holds that man
is totally free and responsible for his acts.

282
01:21:37,475 --> 01:21:44,481
This responsibility that causes
man's dread and anguish,
is one of George's favorite topics.

283
01:21:59,706 --> 01:22:06,670
The German philosopher, Martin Heidegger,
argued that human beings can never hope
to understand why they are here.

284
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:12,760
Instead, each individual must choose a goal
and follow it with passionate conviction...

285
01:22:12,844 --> 01:22:18,849
aware of the certainty of death and
the ultimate meaninglessness of one's life.

286
01:23:20,954 --> 01:23:28,919
Cocaine use triggers symptoms
associated with the "fight or flight" syndrome,
increasing the heart rate and blood pressure.

287
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:36,010
It constricts blood vessels, dilates
the bronchioles, increases the blood sugar level
and prepares the body for emergencies.

288
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:44,018
Cocaine can have traumatic effects on the heart,
including a disordered heartbeat and/or
possible failure of the cardiovascular system.

289
01:25:44,430 --> 01:25:50,435
In 1980, Richard Pryor, was badly burned
trying to freebase cocaine.

290
01:25:51,855 --> 01:25:58,861
In 1982, at the age of 33,
John Belushi died in the world famous
Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles...

291
01:25:58,945 --> 01:26:04,366
after allegedly using
a combination of cocaine and heroine.

292
01:26:32,687 --> 01:26:38,692
President Reagan launched the "War on Drugs"
in the mid 1980s by saying...

293
01:26:38,776 --> 01:26:44,781
"The American people want their government
to get tough and go on the offensive."

294
01:27:25,949 --> 01:27:31,954
Casual and popular use of cocaine
dwindled in the late 1980s...

295
01:27:32,038 --> 01:27:38,043
yet the Reagan and Bush administrations
called for an escalation in fighting drugs.

296
01:27:39,045 --> 01:27:45,384
In 2000, the U.S. federal government spent
over $19.2 billion on the "War on Drugs"...

297
01:27:45,468 --> 01:27:51,473
and state and local governments
have spent at least another $20 billion.

298
01:28:02,151 --> 01:28:08,156
During 1999, in the U.S.,
someone was arrested every 20 seconds
for a drug law offense.

299
01:28:14,914 --> 01:28:20,919
An average of 648 people were locked up
every day for drug violations.

300
01:29:21,272 --> 01:29:27,277
In 1985, the cocaine George was arrested with
had exceeded the eight ounces specified...

301
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:34,368
in a new minimum-sentencing statue
signed into law only months earlier
by Gov. Michael Dukakis.

302
01:29:38,998 --> 01:29:45,003
George was facing a mandatory sentence
of 10 years without parole.

303
01:29:48,925 --> 01:29:55,931
Before mandatory
minimum sentencing laws were passed,
the average drug sentence was 21 months.

304
01:30:25,336 --> 01:30:30,465
It is a federal crime for anyone
who has been released on bail...

305
01:30:30,550 --> 01:30:35,554
to willfully fail to appear
when required to do so.

306
01:31:10,631 --> 01:31:16,303
The drug war creates
huge "asset forfeiture" for the DEA.

307
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:23,643
Asset forfeiture occurs when the DEA seizes
property from drug arrests.

308
01:31:25,855 --> 01:31:31,193
In 2001, it's estimated to be
a half billion dollar per year enterprise.

309
01:32:12,109 --> 01:32:19,324
In exchange for U.S. arms for the cause
of the Nicaraguan Contras,
Panama's president, Noriega...

310
01:32:19,408 --> 01:32:26,748
was allowed to use Panama's planes
to smuggle drugs for the cartel
into the U.S. during the 1980s.

311
01:32:26,832 --> 01:32:33,505
Noriega's drug running operation was integral
to Oliver North's arms running operations.

312
01:32:37,885 --> 01:32:44,849
In 1989, 24,000 U.S. troops invaded Panama,
captured Noriega and arrested him
for drug trafficking.

313
01:32:44,934 --> 01:32:50,939
Noriega was convicted of drug trafficking,
money laundering and racketeering.

314
01:32:51,023 --> 01:32:56,361
He was sentenced to 40 years
in a U.S. federal prison.

315
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:41,323
In 1987, 25% of children
lived below poverty level.

316
01:33:41,407 --> 01:33:45,410
The poverty level in 1987
for a family of four was $12,000.

317
01:34:48,265 --> 01:34:53,269
Some of the effects of drugs
on an individual's ability to drive include:

318
01:34:53,354 --> 01:34:59,359
impaired reaction times, fatigue,
impaired perception and loss of attention.

319
01:35:25,302 --> 01:35:31,307
About two in every five Americans
will be involved in an alcohol-related crash
at some time in their lives.

320
01:35:31,392 --> 01:35:38,398
During the 1990s, four times as many Americans
died in drunk driving accidents
as were killed in the Vietnam War.

321
01:36:22,443 --> 01:36:27,447
Marriages are the first casualty
of arrest and conviction.

322
01:36:27,531 --> 01:36:33,203
Imprisonment is statutory grounds
for divorce in most states.

323
01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:42,712
The mental stress of arrest and imprisonment
is often followed by the added trauma
of divorce and loss of parental rights.

324
01:37:02,566 --> 01:37:10,657
Before George's trial, the one-kilo of cocaine
to be used as evidence against him,
mysteriously disappeared.

325
01:37:10,741 --> 01:37:17,747
George served only 40 months
in a minimum-security prison.

326
01:39:40,975 --> 01:39:47,647
70% of all children born in 1980
spent a portion of their childhood
in a single parent family.

327
01:39:49,316 --> 01:39:54,988
Over one million children
are affected by divorce each year.

328
01:40:18,429 --> 01:40:25,101
Non-custodial fathers paid, on average,
seven percent of their personal income
in child support in 1990.

329
01:40:26,103 --> 01:40:32,108
This figure is low,
mainly because so many non-custodial fathers
paid no child support in 1990.

330
01:40:34,111 --> 01:40:38,948
Over 80% of all non-custodial fathers
either paid no child support...

331
01:40:39,033 --> 01:40:44,037
or spent less than 15%
of their personal income on child support.

332
01:40:48,625 --> 01:40:54,630
Single parent households grew from
five percent of all U.S. households in 1970...

333
01:40:54,715 --> 01:40:59,719
to nine percent
of all U.S. households in 1990.

334
01:41:00,721 --> 01:41:06,726
Single parent households
with children under the age of 18
numbered 8.6 million in 1990.

335
01:41:07,728 --> 01:41:12,732
This is a 46% increase since 1980.

336
01:41:14,735 --> 01:41:22,408
Seven million were single parent families
headed by a woman with 1.6 million
single parent families headed by a man.

337
01:41:25,746 --> 01:41:31,667
The average amount of child support
received by mothers in 1989
amounted to $2,995 per child.

338
01:41:39,927 --> 01:41:44,972
In 1990, 45% of single parent families
headed by a woman...

339
01:41:45,057 --> 01:41:50,603
and 19% of single parent families
headed by a man lived in poverty...

340
01:41:50,687 --> 01:41:56,901
as compared to only eight percent
of married couples
with children under the age of 18.

341
01:42:05,244 --> 01:42:13,251
The number of single parent households
headed by men increased
from 14% in 1980 to 19% in 1990.

342
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:06,345
In 1986, President Reagan
signed a classified national security
decision directive...

343
01:43:06,430 --> 01:43:11,434
declaring drug trafficking
as a "national security threat".

344
01:43:13,854 --> 01:43:19,942
In 1989, President Bush signed
the National Security Dire Directive 18...

345
01:43:20,027 --> 01:43:27,158
which called for more than $250 million worth
of military law enforcement and intelligence
systems to fight the Andean cartels...

346
01:43:27,242 --> 01:43:33,247
and another $65 million
in emergency military aid to Colombia alone.

347
01:44:19,586 --> 01:44:24,924
Johnny Depp's first daughter
was born in 1999.

348
01:45:49,051 --> 01:45:56,057
From 1996 to 1999 federal informants
were paid at least $260 million
by U.S. government agencies.

349
01:46:03,357 --> 01:46:09,653
The DEA acknowledges having twice as many
documented informants as field agents.

350
01:46:38,308 --> 01:46:44,313
The number of DEA agents in 1973
was 1,470 compared to 4,561 in 2000.

351
01:46:47,317 --> 01:46:54,323
The DEA budget in 1973 was $74 million;
in 1990 - $769 million;
in 2000 - $1.5 billion.

352
01:48:02,601 --> 01:48:08,898
George believed there were three ways
to get arrested in the drug business:

353
01:48:08,982 --> 01:48:16,155
by accident,
selling or buying from an undercover cop
or from the "inside".

354
01:48:51,316 --> 01:48:57,655
People with certain histories
and personality traits
are more likely to become addicts.

355
01:48:58,657 --> 01:49:05,287
In theory, addiction seems to run in families,
although the specific addictions can vary.

356
01:49:05,372 --> 01:49:11,377
For example, an alcoholic father
might have a workaholic daughter.

357
01:49:13,046 --> 01:49:19,051
Approximately 30%
of alcoholics' children become addicts.

358
01:50:07,017 --> 01:50:13,689
Johnny prepared for the role of George Jung
by visiting with him
on numerous occasions at the prison.

359
01:50:13,773 --> 01:50:20,112
They discussed both his experiences
and his philosophies on life.

360
01:50:21,823 --> 01:50:29,496
"He really saw himself as a modern pirate,"
said Depp. "He didn't believe in the system
or politics or rules or bosses."

361
01:50:29,581 --> 01:50:34,793
"He didn't want to go out and end up
in a cookie cutter job like everybody else."

362
01:50:34,878 --> 01:50:39,548
"He just wanted to go out there
and really live."

363
01:50:42,218 --> 01:50:47,890
Depp felt he could relate
to Jung's dizzying rise to fame and fortune.

364
01:50:49,225 --> 01:50:56,231
"It reminded me of when I started acting
because I didn't want to be this at all
when I first started out."

365
01:50:56,316 --> 01:51:02,279
"But I started making money
like I'd never seen before in my life."

366
01:51:02,364 --> 01:51:08,369
"And I think that's what happened to George.
He was going into business, the way he saw it."

367
01:54:11,302 --> 01:54:16,598
Addiction is a physical
and/or psychological dependence
on a substance or behavior.

368
01:54:16,683 --> 01:54:20,644
It begins by using something to feel good.

369
01:54:20,728 --> 01:54:25,107
Over time, the person feels less pleasure,
and more addicted.

370
01:54:25,191 --> 01:54:30,195
Eventually, the addiction leads to a feeling of
"I don't care, as long as I can..."...

371
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:35,284
even when the effects are devastating
to the addicted person or others.

372
01:54:35,368 --> 01:54:42,749
Getting it - and more of it -
becomes the person's top priority.
Everything else is expendable.

373
01:55:28,171 --> 01:55:35,052
During the 1970s and 1980s, the mandatory
minimum sentencing laws forced judges
to hand out fixed sentences without parole...

374
01:55:35,136 --> 01:55:40,140
to people convicted of possession
or the trafficking of illegal drugs.

375
01:55:44,270 --> 01:55:51,276
In 1990, more than half of the federal inmates
serving mandatory minimum sentences,
were first time offenders.

376
01:55:52,612 --> 01:55:59,618
In 1993, 21% of the total federal
prison population were low-level drug violators
with no history of prior incarceration.

377
01:56:10,254 --> 01:56:16,259
Mandatory minimum prison sentences
were applied in 65% of drug cases in 1997.

378
01:56:41,703 --> 01:56:48,709
The Federal Bureau of Prison's budget increased
more than 1,400% after the enactment
of mandatory minimum sentences.

379
01:56:50,712 --> 01:56:56,049
The budget jumped from $220 million in 1986
to $3.19 billion in 1997.

380
01:56:58,052 --> 01:57:04,057
In 2000, the U.S. had one of the world's
highest proportion of its population in prison.

381
01:57:06,060 --> 01:57:12,733
Today, illegal drug traffic
constitutes one of the most profitable
and extensive markets in the world.

382
01:57:14,402 --> 01:57:20,240
Volume of sales is calculated between
$400 and $500 billion per year...

383
01:57:20,324 --> 01:57:26,163
or about ten percent of the world's
international commodity trade.
