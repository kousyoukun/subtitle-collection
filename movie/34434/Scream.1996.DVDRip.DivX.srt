1
00:00:20,516 --> 00:00:22,596
- Hello?
- Hello.

2
00:00:22,676 --> 00:00:24,996
- Yes?
- Who is this?

3
00:00:25,076 --> 00:00:27,956
- Who you trying to reach?
- What number is this?

4
00:00:28,036 --> 00:00:30,836
- What number are you trying to reach?
- I don't know.

5
00:00:30,915 --> 00:00:33,235
- I think you have the wrong number.
- Do I?

6
00:00:33,315 --> 00:00:35,635
It happens. Take it easy.

7
00:00:43,555 --> 00:00:46,835
- Hello!
- I'm sorry. I guess
I dialed the wrong number.

8
00:00:46,915 --> 00:00:50,195
- So, why'd you dial it again?
- To apologize.

9
00:00:50,275 --> 00:00:53,794
- You're forgiven. Bye, now.
- Wait, wait! Don't hang up.

10
00:00:53,874 --> 00:00:56,114
- What?
- I wanna talk to you for a second.

11
00:00:56,194 --> 00:00:59,154
They've got 900-numbers
for that. See ya.

12
00:01:19,593 --> 00:01:22,193
- Hello.
- Why don't you want to talk to me?

13
00:01:22,273 --> 00:01:26,153
- Who is this?
- You tell me your name,
I'll tell you mine.

14
00:01:26,233 --> 00:01:29,033
- I don't think so.

15
00:01:29,113 --> 00:01:31,273
- What's that noise?
- Popcorn.

16
00:01:31,353 --> 00:01:33,193
- You're making popcorn?
- Uh-huh.

17
00:01:33,273 --> 00:01:35,392
I only eat popcorn
at the movies.

18
00:01:35,472 --> 00:01:38,632
- Well, I'm getting ready
to watch a video.
- Really? What?

19
00:01:38,712 --> 00:01:40,632
Oh, just some scary movie.

20
00:01:40,672 --> 00:01:42,912
- You like scary movies?
- Uh-huh.

21
00:01:42,952 --> 00:01:44,952
What's your favorite
scary movie?

22
00:01:44,992 --> 00:01:47,792
- Uh, I don't know.
- You have to have a favorite.

23
00:01:47,872 --> 00:01:49,712
What comes to mind?

24
00:01:49,792 --> 00:01:51,632
Um..."Halloween."

25
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:53,952
You know, the one with the guy
in the white mask...

26
00:01:54,032 --> 00:01:56,791
who walks around
and stalks baby-sitters.

27
00:01:56,831 --> 00:01:58,711
- Yeah.
- What's yours?

28
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:03,031
- Guess.
- Um..."Nightmare on Elm Street."

29
00:02:03,071 --> 00:02:05,751
Is that the one where
the guy had knives for fingers?

30
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:08,151
- Yeah, Freddy Krueger.
- Freddy, that's right.

31
00:02:08,191 --> 00:02:10,751
I liked that movie.
It was scary.

32
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:13,271
Yeah, the first one was,
but the rest sucked.

33
00:02:13,311 --> 00:02:15,230
So, you got a boyfriend?

34
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,390
Why? You wanna ask me
out on a date?

35
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,910
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?

36
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:24,030
- Mm... no.
- You never told me your name.

37
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,950
Why do you want
to know my name?

38
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:29,270
'Cause I wanna know
who I'm looking at.

39
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,910
- What did you say?
- I wanna know who I'm talking to.

40
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,789
- That's not what you said.
- What do you think I said?

41
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:40,789
What?

42
00:02:41,949 --> 00:02:43,869
Hello?

43
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:46,069
Look, I gotta go.

44
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:47,989
Wait! I thought we
were gonna go out.

45
00:02:48,029 --> 00:02:50,269
Uh, nah, I don't think so.

46
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:52,189
Don't hang up on me!

47
00:03:00,228 --> 00:03:02,428
Shit.

48
00:03:02,508 --> 00:03:06,068
- Yes?
- I told you not to hang up on me.

49
00:03:06,108 --> 00:03:08,148
- What do you want?
- To talk.

50
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,748
Well, dial someone else, okay?

51
00:03:19,707 --> 00:03:22,587
- Listen, asshole!
- No, you listen, you little bitch!

52
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:26,707
You hang up on me again,
I'll cut you like a fish, understand?

53
00:03:26,747 --> 00:03:29,187
Yeah.

54
00:03:29,267 --> 00:03:31,107
Is this some kind of joke?

55
00:03:31,187 --> 00:03:33,507
More of a game, really.

56
00:03:35,027 --> 00:03:38,067
Can you handle that...

57
00:03:38,146 --> 00:03:40,466
blondie?

58
00:03:50,186 --> 00:03:52,026
Can you see me?

59
00:03:54,906 --> 00:03:59,265
Listen, I am two seconds away
from calling the police.

60
00:03:59,345 --> 00:04:03,385
They'd never make it in time.
We're out in the middle of nowhere.

61
00:04:03,465 --> 00:04:08,305
- What do you want?
- To see what your insides look like.

62
00:04:16,305 --> 00:04:19,665
Who's there?
Who's there?

63
00:04:20,784 --> 00:04:22,624
- I'm calling the police.

64
00:04:24,944 --> 00:04:27,184
You should never say,
"Who's there?"

65
00:04:27,224 --> 00:04:29,584
Don't you watch scary movies?
It's a death wish.

66
00:04:29,624 --> 00:04:34,064
You might as well just
come out here to investigate
a strange noise or somethin'.

67
00:04:34,104 --> 00:04:37,424
Look, you've had
your fun now...

68
00:04:37,464 --> 00:04:40,903
- so I think you better
just leave or else.
- Or else what?

69
00:04:40,983 --> 00:04:45,423
Or else my boyfriend'll
be here any second, and he'll
be pissed when he finds out.

70
00:04:45,463 --> 00:04:47,343
I thought you didn't
have a boyfriend.

71
00:04:47,383 --> 00:04:51,103
I lied! I do have a boyfriend,
and he'll be here any second...

72
00:04:51,183 --> 00:04:54,103
- so your ass better be gone.
- Sure.

73
00:04:54,183 --> 00:04:56,543
I swear.

74
00:04:56,623 --> 00:05:01,302
He's big, and he plays football
and he'll kick the shit out of you!

75
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:04,462
I'm getting scared.
I'm shaking in my boots.

76
00:05:04,502 --> 00:05:06,862
So you better just leave.

77
00:05:06,902 --> 00:05:08,782
His name wouldn't be...

78
00:05:08,822 --> 00:05:11,662
Steve, would it?

79
00:05:11,702 --> 00:05:14,542
How do you know his name?

80
00:05:14,582 --> 00:05:18,382
Turn on the patio lights... again.

81
00:05:29,941 --> 00:05:31,981
Oh, God!

82
00:05:32,021 --> 00:05:35,581
- I wouldn't
do that if I were you.
- Where are you?

83
00:05:35,661 --> 00:05:37,621
- Guess.
- Please don't hurt him.

84
00:05:37,701 --> 00:05:40,221
- That all depends on you.
- Why are you doing this?

85
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:42,661
- I wanna play a game.
- No.

86
00:05:42,741 --> 00:05:45,220
- Then he dies right now!
- No! No!

87
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,620
Which is it?
Which is it?

88
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,460
Wha... What kind of game?

89
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:58,060
Turn off the light.
You'll see what kind of game.

90
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,980
Just do it!

91
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,899
Casey! No! No!

92
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:06,939
No! Casey!

93
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:08,859
Here's how we play.

94
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:13,099
I ask a question.
If you get it right, Steve lives.

95
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,379
- Please don't do this.
- Come on. It'll be fun.

96
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:17,379
- Please...
- It's an easy category.

97
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:19,299
- Please...
- Movie trivia.

98
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,099
- I'll even give you
a warm-up question.
- Don't do this. I can't.

99
00:06:22,179 --> 00:06:25,458
- Name the killer in "Halloween."
- No.

100
00:06:25,538 --> 00:06:28,338
Come on! It's your favorite
scary movie, remember?

101
00:06:28,418 --> 00:06:31,538
- He had a white mask;
he stalked the baby-sitters.
- I don't know.

102
00:06:31,618 --> 00:06:34,418
- Come on. Yes, you do.
- No, please.

103
00:06:34,498 --> 00:06:37,578
- What's his name?
- I can't think.

104
00:06:37,618 --> 00:06:40,018
Steve's counting on you.

105
00:06:40,098 --> 00:06:43,018
Michael...
Michael, Michael.

106
00:06:43,058 --> 00:06:45,537
Yes! Very good.

107
00:06:45,617 --> 00:06:47,457
Now for the real question.

108
00:06:47,537 --> 00:06:49,777
- No!
- But you're doing so well.

109
00:06:49,857 --> 00:06:53,137
- We can't stop now.
- Please stop! Leave us alone!

110
00:06:53,177 --> 00:06:56,137
Answer the question.
Same category.

111
00:06:56,177 --> 00:06:59,017
Oh, please stop.

112
00:06:59,057 --> 00:07:02,057
Name the killer
in "Friday the 13th."

113
00:07:02,097 --> 00:07:04,657
Jason! Jason, Jason!

114
00:07:04,737 --> 00:07:07,656
I'm sorry.
That's the wrong answer.

115
00:07:07,736 --> 00:07:11,056
No, it's not! No, it's not.
It was Jason.

116
00:07:11,136 --> 00:07:13,256
Afraid not. No way.

117
00:07:13,296 --> 00:07:17,096
Listen, it was Jason!
I saw that movie 20 goddamn times!

118
00:07:17,176 --> 00:07:20,176
Then you should know Jason's mother,
Mrs. Voorhees, was the original killer.

119
00:07:20,256 --> 00:07:22,456
Jason didn't show up
until the sequel.

120
00:07:22,536 --> 00:07:25,296
I'm afraid that was
a wrong answer.

121
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:27,215
You tricked me.

122
00:07:27,255 --> 00:07:29,215
Lucky for you
there's a bonus round.

123
00:07:29,295 --> 00:07:32,895
But poor Steve.
I'm afraid he's out!

124
00:07:56,294 --> 00:08:00,094
Hey, we're not finished yet.

125
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:04,534
Final question.
Are you ready?

126
00:08:04,614 --> 00:08:08,613
Please,
please, leave me alone.

127
00:08:08,653 --> 00:08:10,533
Answer the question, and I will.

128
00:08:11,853 --> 00:08:15,133
What door am I at?

129
00:08:15,213 --> 00:08:18,653
- What?
- There are two main doors to your house.

130
00:08:18,733 --> 00:08:20,573
The front door,
the patio doors.

131
00:08:20,653 --> 00:08:22,493
If you answer correctly, you live.

132
00:08:22,573 --> 00:08:24,693
Very simple.

133
00:08:24,773 --> 00:08:27,733
Don't do this.
I can't; I won't.

134
00:08:27,813 --> 00:08:30,252
Your call.

135
00:09:54,368 --> 00:09:56,288
- Aah!

136
00:10:46,886 --> 00:10:50,046
Did you water over here today?

137
00:10:50,086 --> 00:10:52,486
- It was just that water from the rain.
- They look great, don't they?

138
00:10:52,566 --> 00:10:55,365
- Don't they smell strong?
- I told you you could send it back.

139
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,765
Mom!

140
00:11:00,805 --> 00:11:03,005
- Jesus!
- What is it?

141
00:11:16,284 --> 00:11:18,204
Casey!

142
00:11:21,444 --> 00:11:23,724
Oh, G...

143
00:11:25,524 --> 00:11:27,524
Casey. Casey.

144
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,444
Casey!

145
00:11:31,404 --> 00:11:33,644
- Where is she?
- Call the police!

146
00:11:38,723 --> 00:11:40,563
- Casey!

147
00:11:40,643 --> 00:11:43,363
- Casey, are you upstairs?
- Oh, my God. Casey, baby?

148
00:11:43,443 --> 00:11:45,283
- Casey?
- She's here.

149
00:11:45,363 --> 00:11:47,683
- Mom.
- Oh, my God,
I can hear her.

150
00:11:47,763 --> 00:11:51,003
- Mom.
- Where is she?

151
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:54,843
Oh, my God!
I can hear her.

152
00:11:54,883 --> 00:11:56,763
- Hey!

153
00:11:59,362 --> 00:12:03,162
Get in the car.
Drive down to the MacKenzies'.

154
00:12:03,202 --> 00:12:06,442
- No. No, not my daughter.
- Just go.

155
00:12:06,522 --> 00:12:08,362
- Not my daughter.
- Call the police.

156
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,600
- It's just me.

157
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,560
- Billy, what are you doing here?
- Sorry, don't hate me.

158
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,840
- You sleep in that?
- Yes, I sleep in this.

159
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,760
My dad is in the other room.
You can't be in here.

160
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,079
- I'll just stay a sec.

161
00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:03,119
No... You gotta go. Go, go, go.

162
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,239
What's going on in there?

163
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,159
- Are you okay?
- Can you knock?

164
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,999
- I heard screaming.
- No, you didn't.

165
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:11,279
No?

166
00:13:11,359 --> 00:13:14,319
Oh, well.
I'm hitting the sack.

167
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,759
My flight leaves
first thing in the morning.

168
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:19,759
Now, the expo runs all weekend,
so I won't be back 'til Sunday.

169
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,998
- There's cash on the table,
and I'm staying at...
- The Hilton.

170
00:13:23,038 --> 00:13:25,838
- Out at the airport, so call if...
- I need anything.

171
00:13:25,918 --> 00:13:28,798
I could've sworn
I heard screaming.

172
00:13:28,878 --> 00:13:30,838
Have a good trip, okay?

173
00:13:30,878 --> 00:13:32,758
Sleep tight, sweetie.

174
00:13:37,518 --> 00:13:39,038
Oh... close call.

175
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,797
Billy, what're you doing here?

176
00:13:41,877 --> 00:13:43,717
It occurred to me that...

177
00:13:43,797 --> 00:13:45,877
- I've never snuck through
your bedroom window.
- Shh, shh, shh.

178
00:13:45,957 --> 00:13:48,517
Great idea, now that
it's out of your system.

179
00:13:48,597 --> 00:13:50,437
I was home watching television.

180
00:13:50,517 --> 00:13:52,877
"The," uh,
"The Exorcist" was on.

181
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:56,637
- It got me thinking of you.
- It did?

182
00:13:56,717 --> 00:14:00,397
Yeah, it was edited for TV. You know,
all the good stuff was cut out.

183
00:14:00,477 --> 00:14:04,596
And it got me thinking of us...

184
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:08,116
how two years ago
we started off hot and heavy.

185
00:14:08,156 --> 00:14:11,916
Nice solid R-rating
on our way to an NC-17.

186
00:14:13,356 --> 00:14:16,676
And now... things have changed and...

187
00:14:21,596 --> 00:14:24,835
lately we're just sort of
edited for television.

188
00:14:24,915 --> 00:14:29,115
Oh, so you thought
you would climb in my window...

189
00:14:29,155 --> 00:14:32,195
- and we'd have a little raw footage?
- No.

190
00:14:32,275 --> 00:14:36,275
No, I wouldn't dream of breaking
your underwear rule.

191
00:14:36,315 --> 00:14:41,075
I just thought maybe we could do
a little on-top-of-the-clothes stuff.

192
00:14:43,714 --> 00:14:47,714
- Okay.
- Yeah?

193
00:14:47,794 --> 00:14:49,634
Yeah.

194
00:14:49,714 --> 00:14:53,474
If we ever fly away

195
00:14:53,554 --> 00:14:57,754
Baby, I'm with you

196
00:14:57,834 --> 00:15:02,474
Baby, I'm your man

197
00:15:02,554 --> 00:15:04,393
Hey.

198
00:15:08,673 --> 00:15:14,033
La, la, la, la
la, la, la

199
00:15:18,953 --> 00:15:22,033
Okay. Okay, okay.
Time is up, stud-muffin.

200
00:15:22,073 --> 00:15:24,913
God, you see what
you do to me?

201
00:15:24,953 --> 00:15:28,272
You know what
my dad'll do to you?

202
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:30,672
Yeah.

203
00:15:30,712 --> 00:15:33,552
- I'm going.
- Okay.

204
00:15:36,792 --> 00:15:39,592
Romeo and Juliet

205
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:42,392
Are together in eternity

206
00:15:42,472 --> 00:15:44,952
You know, l... I appreciate
the romantic gesture.

207
00:15:45,032 --> 00:15:46,871
So, come on, baby

208
00:15:46,951 --> 00:15:50,631
Hey, about the, uh,
the sex stuff?

209
00:15:50,711 --> 00:15:53,271
I'm not trying
to rush you at all.

210
00:15:53,351 --> 00:15:55,671
I was only half serious.

211
00:15:55,751 --> 00:15:58,031
Okay.

212
00:15:58,071 --> 00:16:01,191
Baby, I'm your man

213
00:16:02,431 --> 00:16:05,671
Baby, I'm your man

214
00:16:05,751 --> 00:16:07,590
Hey, Billy.

215
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:11,750
Would you settle for
a PG-13 relationship?

216
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:14,390
What's that?

217
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:19,710
- La, la, la-la, la

218
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:23,510
My God. You're just a tease.

219
00:16:30,229 --> 00:16:33,189
Thirty-five...

220
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:35,829
Situation under control.

221
00:16:35,909 --> 00:16:38,709
Roger, dispatch.

222
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,429
There's blood found?
All right.

223
00:16:55,988 --> 00:16:58,948
...are doing drugs they buy
in the classrooms...

224
00:16:59,028 --> 00:17:01,348
and that they are
involved in the occult.

225
00:17:01,428 --> 00:17:03,548
Occult?

226
00:17:03,628 --> 00:17:06,548
Woodsboro, California,
was devastated last night...

227
00:17:06,628 --> 00:17:09,267
when two young teenagers
were found brutally murdered.

228
00:17:09,347 --> 00:17:11,387
Authorities have yet
to issue a statement...

229
00:17:11,467 --> 00:17:14,747
but our sources tell us
that no arrest has been made...

230
00:17:14,827 --> 00:17:16,667
- and the murderer could strike again.
- Do you believe this shit?

231
00:17:16,747 --> 00:17:19,747
- Damn! What is going on?
- You don't know?

232
00:17:19,827 --> 00:17:23,267
Casey Becker and Steve Orth
were killed last night.

233
00:17:23,347 --> 00:17:25,187
What? No way.

234
00:17:25,267 --> 00:17:27,587
And we're not just talking killed;
we're talking splatter-movie killed.

235
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:29,587
Ripped open from end to end.

236
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:32,106
Casey Becker, she sits
next to me in English.

237
00:17:32,146 --> 00:17:34,026
Not anymore.
It's so sad.

238
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:36,306
Her mom and dad, they found her
hanging from a tree...

239
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:39,146
- her insides on the outside.
- Oh, my God!

240
00:17:39,186 --> 00:17:41,066
Do they know who did it?

241
00:17:41,106 --> 00:17:44,306
Fucking clueless.
They're interrogating the entire school.

242
00:17:44,346 --> 00:17:46,746
- Teachers, students, janitors.
- They think it's school-related?

243
00:17:46,826 --> 00:17:50,586
They don't know.
Dewey was saying this is
the worst crime they've seen in years.

244
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,505
- Even worse than...

245
00:17:52,585 --> 00:17:55,145
Well... it's bad.

246
00:18:00,065 --> 00:18:03,465
- Here you go, Mrs. Tate.
- Thank you, James.

247
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:07,785
Sidney.

248
00:18:07,825 --> 00:18:10,105
It would appear to be your turn.

249
00:18:14,184 --> 00:18:17,584
- Who's up next?
- Uh, Sidney Prescott.

250
00:18:17,664 --> 00:18:20,264
She was daughter of, uh...

251
00:18:21,584 --> 00:18:24,064
- Sidney, how you feelin'?
- Fine.

252
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,344
Hi, Sidney.

253
00:18:26,384 --> 00:18:27,864
Sheriff Burke, Dewey.

254
00:18:27,944 --> 00:18:31,464
Uh, that's Deputy Riley today, Sid.

255
00:18:31,504 --> 00:18:34,783
- How is everything?
- Good.

256
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,863
And your dad?
How's he doin'?

257
00:18:36,943 --> 00:18:40,663
- We're fine. Thanks.
- We're gonna keep this
very brief, Sidney.

258
00:18:40,743 --> 00:18:43,303
The police just want to ask you
a few questions. You okay?

259
00:18:43,343 --> 00:18:44,663
Mm-hmm.

260
00:18:44,743 --> 00:18:47,863
Sidney, were you
very close to Casey Becker?

261
00:18:47,943 --> 00:18:51,383
Remember, your principal loves you,
and I want you to be safe.

262
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,982
All students are encouraged to return
home promptly from school grounds.

263
00:18:55,022 --> 00:18:56,982
Avoid strangers;
walk in twos and threes.

264
00:18:57,062 --> 00:18:58,902
What kind of questions
did they ask you, Sidney?

265
00:18:58,982 --> 00:19:01,062
- They asked if I knew Casey.
- They asked me that too.

266
00:19:01,142 --> 00:19:03,502
- Hey, did they ask if you like to hunt?
- Yeah, they did.

267
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,422
Did they ask you?

268
00:19:05,462 --> 00:19:07,382
Why would they ask you
if you liked to hunt?

269
00:19:07,462 --> 00:19:09,782
'Cause their bodies were gutted.

270
00:19:09,862 --> 00:19:12,942
- Thank you, Randy.
- They didn't ask me if I like to hunt.

271
00:19:13,022 --> 00:19:15,941
- 'Cause there's no way
a girl could've killed 'em.
- That is so sexist.

272
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:18,541
The killer could easily be female.
"Basic Instinct."

273
00:19:18,621 --> 00:19:20,861
That was an ice pick.
Not exactly the same thing.

274
00:19:20,941 --> 00:19:23,341
Yeah, Casey and Steve
were completely hollowed out.

275
00:19:23,421 --> 00:19:25,861
And the fact is, it takes a man
to do something like that.

276
00:19:25,901 --> 00:19:27,781
Or a man's mentality.

277
00:19:27,821 --> 00:19:30,221
How do you... gut someone?

278
00:19:33,421 --> 00:19:37,740
You take a knife, and you slit 'em
from the groin to sternum.

279
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:41,420
Hey, it's called tact,
you fuck rag.

280
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,580
Hey, Stu, didn't you
used to date Casey?

281
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:47,500
- Yeah, for like two seconds.
- Before she
dumped him for Steve.

282
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,420
I thought you
dumped her for me.

283
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,700
- I did. He's full of shit.
- And are the police aware
that you dated the victim?

284
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,779
Hey, what're you saying?
That I killed her?

285
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,739
It would certainly improve
your high school "Q."

286
00:19:57,819 --> 00:20:01,499
- Stu was with me last night, okay?
- Yeah, I was.

287
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:04,979
Was that before or after
he sliced and diced?

288
00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:07,019
Fuck you, nutcase.
Where were you last night?

289
00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:10,779
- Working, thank you.
- At the video store?
I thought they fired your ass.

290
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:12,739
Twice.

291
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:16,498
- I didn't kill anybody.
- Nobody said you did.

292
00:20:16,578 --> 00:20:18,178
Thanks, buddy.

293
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:23,098
Besides, it takes a man
to do something like that.

294
00:20:23,178 --> 00:20:26,138
- I'm gonna gut your ass
in a second, kid.
- Tell me something.

295
00:20:26,218 --> 00:20:28,538
Did you really put
her liver in the mailbox?

296
00:20:28,618 --> 00:20:32,338
'Cause I heard that they
found her liver in the mailbox
next to her spleen and pancreas.

297
00:20:32,418 --> 00:20:34,338
You goon! Fuck!
I'm trying to eat here.

298
00:20:34,418 --> 00:20:36,418
She's getting mad, all right?

299
00:20:36,498 --> 00:20:38,377
You better "liver" alone.

300
00:20:41,057 --> 00:20:43,937
"Liver" alone!

301
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:49,937
"Liv..." Ow!
"Liver. Liver." It was a joke.

302
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:58,336
See you, Sidney.
I'll talk to you tomorrow, Sid.

303
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:23,895
So, you're sure I can stay over,
'cause my dad won't be back 'til Sunday.

304
00:21:23,975 --> 00:21:26,095
No problem.
I'll pick you up after practice.

305
00:21:27,615 --> 00:21:29,455
You okay?

306
00:21:29,535 --> 00:21:31,855
Uh-huh. It's just...

307
00:21:31,935 --> 00:21:33,775
you know, the police
and the reporters...

308
00:21:33,855 --> 00:21:35,695
it's like déjà vu
all over again.

309
00:21:35,775 --> 00:21:37,975
I'll be there by 7:00.
I promise.

310
00:21:38,055 --> 00:21:40,374
- Thanks, Tatum.
- Later.

311
00:22:26,132 --> 00:22:28,252
The bodies of 17-year-old
Casey Becker...

312
00:22:28,292 --> 00:22:30,172
and her 18-year-old boyfriend,
Steven Orth...

313
00:22:30,212 --> 00:22:32,092
were discovered late last night
by the girl's parents...

314
00:22:32,132 --> 00:22:34,132
The Woodsboro double murder case.

315
00:22:34,212 --> 00:22:37,052
Authorities are baffled
by the lack of clues and the savage...

316
00:22:37,132 --> 00:22:40,532
The town's in shock, and no one can
quite believe what has happened here...

317
00:22:40,612 --> 00:22:43,211
although this is not the first time
this small community...

318
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:46,171
of Woodsboro
has endured such tragedy.

319
00:22:46,211 --> 00:22:48,131
Only a year ago
Maureen Prescott, wife and mother...

320
00:22:48,211 --> 00:22:52,491
was found raped and murdered
not far from this peaceful town square.

321
00:24:00,088 --> 00:24:03,848
- Hello?
- Practice ran late.
I'm on my way, okay?

322
00:24:05,687 --> 00:24:07,527
It's past 7:00.

323
00:24:07,607 --> 00:24:10,407
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't
bite it 'til way after 10:00.

324
00:24:10,487 --> 00:24:13,207
Oh. Oh, that's comforting.

325
00:24:13,247 --> 00:24:15,127
I'm gonna swing by
the video store.

326
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:17,047
I was thinkin' Tom Cruise,
"All The Right Moves."

327
00:24:17,087 --> 00:24:19,847
If you pause it just right,
you can see his penis.

328
00:24:19,927 --> 00:24:22,727
- Whatever. Just hurry, okay?
- Ta-ta, Sid.

329
00:24:33,126 --> 00:24:37,126
- Tatum, just get in the car...
- Hello, Sidney.

330
00:24:37,206 --> 00:24:40,806
Uh... hi, who is this?

331
00:24:40,886 --> 00:24:44,326
You tell me.

332
00:24:44,406 --> 00:24:46,725
Well, I-I have no idea.

333
00:24:46,805 --> 00:24:48,645
Scary night, isn't it?

334
00:24:48,725 --> 00:24:53,325
With the murders and all,
it's like right out of
a horror movie or something.

335
00:24:53,405 --> 00:24:55,845
Randy, you gave yourself away.

336
00:24:55,925 --> 00:24:58,045
Are you calling from work,
'cause Tatum's on her way over.

337
00:24:58,125 --> 00:25:01,485
Do you like scary movies, Sidney?

338
00:25:01,565 --> 00:25:04,485
I like that thing you're doing
with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.

339
00:25:04,565 --> 00:25:07,125
What's your favorite scary movie?

340
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:09,284
Oh, come on.
You know I don't watch that shit.

341
00:25:09,364 --> 00:25:11,804
- Why not? Too scared?
- No. No.

342
00:25:11,884 --> 00:25:13,844
It's just, what's the point?
They're all the same.

343
00:25:13,924 --> 00:25:16,924
Some stupid killer stalking
some big-breasted girl who can't act...

344
00:25:17,004 --> 00:25:19,804
who's always running up the stairs when
she should be going out the front door.

345
00:25:19,884 --> 00:25:23,644
- It's insulting.
- Are you alone in the house?

346
00:25:23,684 --> 00:25:26,164
Randy, that's so unoriginal.
I'm disappointed in you.

347
00:25:26,204 --> 00:25:29,403
Maybe that's because
I'm not Randy.

348
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,083
So, who are you?

349
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:40,083
The question isn't
"Who am I?"

350
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:43,483
The question is
"Where am I?"

351
00:25:44,523 --> 00:25:47,443
S-S-So, where are you?

352
00:25:47,523 --> 00:25:49,402
Your front porch.

353
00:25:53,562 --> 00:25:55,882
Why would you be calling
from my front porch?

354
00:25:55,962 --> 00:25:57,802
That's the original part.

355
00:25:59,482 --> 00:26:01,322
Oh, yeah?

356
00:26:04,762 --> 00:26:06,762
Well, I call your bluff.

357
00:26:19,001 --> 00:26:21,801
- So, where are you?
- Right here.

358
00:26:52,999 --> 00:26:55,439
- Can you see me right now?
- Uh-huh.

359
00:26:55,479 --> 00:26:57,359
Uh-huh, okay.

360
00:26:57,399 --> 00:27:00,279
What am I doin'? Huh?

361
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:03,639
Huh? What am I doin'?
Hello!

362
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:06,759
Nice try, Randy.

363
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:09,079
Tell Tatum to hurry up, okay?
Bye now.

364
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:11,639
If you hang up on me,
you'll die just like your mother!

365
00:27:12,918 --> 00:27:18,158
Do you wanna die, Sidney?
Your mother sure didn't.

366
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:21,198
Fuck you, you cretin!

367
00:27:49,677 --> 00:27:50,957
No!

368
00:28:19,635 --> 00:28:21,515
Shit!

369
00:28:35,235 --> 00:28:37,714
Billy!

370
00:28:37,794 --> 00:28:39,874
The door's locked.
I heard screaming. You all right?

371
00:28:39,954 --> 00:28:41,794
The killer's here.
He's in the house.

372
00:28:41,874 --> 00:28:44,634
He's in the house.
He's got a knife.

373
00:28:44,714 --> 00:28:47,194
He's gone.
He's gone.

374
00:28:47,274 --> 00:28:49,114
It's all right.

375
00:28:58,673 --> 00:29:00,553
What?

376
00:29:03,633 --> 00:29:06,513
Sid, what?

377
00:29:07,793 --> 00:29:09,633
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.
Wait, Sidney, wait!

378
00:29:09,713 --> 00:29:13,073
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
What's going on?

379
00:29:13,153 --> 00:29:16,513
Sidney, come back! Sidney!

380
00:29:20,272 --> 00:29:24,552
Sorry! I found this. Come on!

381
00:29:24,592 --> 00:29:26,472
All right, hold your hands together.

382
00:29:26,512 --> 00:29:29,352
- Do you wish to give up
your right to remain silent?
- I didn't do anything.

383
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:31,272
Do you wish to give up
your right to speak to an attorney...

384
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:33,192
- And have them present
during questioning?

385
00:29:33,232 --> 00:29:37,032
Ask her. She'll tell you.

386
00:29:37,072 --> 00:29:39,111
- I caught him, Sheriff.
- Wait. Who is that?

387
00:29:39,151 --> 00:29:42,471
- Billy Loomis.
- Sheriff, Sheriff, call these guys off.

388
00:29:42,511 --> 00:29:45,511
I didn't do it.
Sheriff, wait.

389
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:47,431
Wait, listen.
Call my dad.

390
00:29:47,471 --> 00:29:49,751
Please, call him.
He'll tell you. Call him.

391
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:53,111
Sidney! Sidney!

392
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:55,151
- How's she doing?
- Sid's tougher than she looks.

393
00:29:55,231 --> 00:29:58,031
She'd have to be,
all the shit she's been through.

394
00:29:58,111 --> 00:30:01,390
- Sid!
- Well, we're seein' a lot of you today.

395
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:05,110
You gonna be able to come
down to the station and answer
a few questions, Sid?

396
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:07,030
Oh, shit! Sidney!

397
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:09,190
God, Sid, I'm so sorry I was late.
Are you all right?

398
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:11,150
Tatum, you can't be here.
This is an official crime scene.

399
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:14,750
- It's okay.
- Her dad's out of town.
She's staying with us.

400
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,670
Does Mom know?

401
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:19,070
- Yes, doofus.
- Let's get you out of here.

402
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,989
- She'll be okay.
- Thanks.

403
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,909
Oh, you won't believe this.

404
00:30:26,309 --> 00:30:28,149
Creepy, huh?

405
00:30:36,829 --> 00:30:38,669
- I'll be damned.
- What?

406
00:30:38,749 --> 00:30:41,548
- Jesus! The camera, hurry!
- My name isn't Jesus.

407
00:30:43,428 --> 00:30:45,268
Sidney, is that you in there?

408
00:30:45,348 --> 00:30:47,188
Excuse me. Is that Sidney Prescott
they took away?

409
00:30:47,268 --> 00:30:49,108
- I'm not talking to you.
- What happened to her?

410
00:30:49,188 --> 00:30:52,428
- None of your damned business.
- I heard something about
a costume. Is that true?

411
00:30:52,468 --> 00:30:56,388
- Can you tell me anything?
- Yeah, you're a real pain in the ass.

412
00:30:56,468 --> 00:30:58,828
Leave Sid alone.

413
00:30:58,868 --> 00:31:00,748
Where's she goin'?

414
00:31:01,747 --> 00:31:04,387
- Look. Kenny?
- Yeah?

415
00:31:04,467 --> 00:31:06,667
I know that you're about
50 pounds overweight...

416
00:31:06,747 --> 00:31:08,587
but when I say "hurry,"

417
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:13,227
please interpret that as
"move your fat, tub-of-lard ass now!"

418
00:31:14,987 --> 00:31:17,707
Did you find him?

419
00:31:17,787 --> 00:31:20,627
You sure it was the Hilton?

420
00:31:20,707 --> 00:31:25,226
- At the airport.
- He's not registered there.

421
00:31:26,546 --> 00:31:29,386
Could he have stayed
somewhere else?

422
00:31:29,426 --> 00:31:32,506
I don't know. I guess.

423
00:31:32,586 --> 00:31:34,746
Don't worry, Sid.

424
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:38,106
- We'll find him.
- Dewey, they got that mask in.

425
00:31:39,626 --> 00:31:41,466
I'll be right back.

426
00:31:49,025 --> 00:31:53,385
Let me ask you this. What're you doin'
with a cellular telephone, son?

427
00:31:53,465 --> 00:31:55,305
Everybody's got one, Sheriff.

428
00:31:55,385 --> 00:31:58,465
I didn't make those calls, I swear.

429
00:31:58,505 --> 00:32:00,385
Check the phone bill,
for Christ's sake.

430
00:32:00,425 --> 00:32:02,625
Call Vital Phone Comp. They got
the records of every number dialed.

431
00:32:02,665 --> 00:32:05,464
Thanks, Hank.
We're on top of it.

432
00:32:05,544 --> 00:32:08,104
What were you doing over
at Sidney's house tonight?

433
00:32:08,184 --> 00:32:10,584
I wanted to see her, that's all.

434
00:32:10,664 --> 00:32:14,264
And last night? Sidney said you crawled
through her window last night too.

435
00:32:14,344 --> 00:32:16,584
You went out last night?

436
00:32:16,624 --> 00:32:21,024
I was watching TV. I got bored.
I decided to go for a ride.

437
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,784
Did you happen to ride by
Casey Becker's house?

438
00:32:23,864 --> 00:32:27,743
No, I didn't. Sheriff,
I didn't kill anybody!

439
00:32:32,863 --> 00:32:35,823
We're gonna have to hold you, son,
'til we get those phone records.

440
00:32:38,663 --> 00:32:41,023
That's crazy.

441
00:32:41,063 --> 00:32:44,982
You know that?
I didn't do it.

442
00:32:54,902 --> 00:32:56,942
Camera Two? Okay.

443
00:32:57,022 --> 00:32:59,182
Are there anymore
doughnuts in there?

444
00:32:59,262 --> 00:33:02,102
- Move it, Kenny.
- They're not lettin' anybody in.

445
00:33:02,182 --> 00:33:04,982
- I'm not just anyone.
- Bitch goddess.

446
00:33:05,062 --> 00:33:06,901
- Kenny, are we on?
- Yeah, go.

447
00:33:06,981 --> 00:33:09,301
Hi, Gale Weathers reporting live
from Woodsboro police station...

448
00:33:09,381 --> 00:33:11,301
where we hope to get a glimpse
of Sidney Prescott.

449
00:33:11,381 --> 00:33:15,181
- Hey, watch it, lady.
- Hey, watch the hand! Do you
know who you're dealing with?

450
00:33:15,261 --> 00:33:18,101
Tell 'em.
Come on, Dad. Tell 'em!

451
00:33:18,181 --> 00:33:20,101
- He's waiting for the lawyer, Billy.
- Sidney!

452
00:33:20,181 --> 00:33:22,301
Sidney, come on.
You know me.

453
00:33:22,381 --> 00:33:25,061
Sidney, look at me!

454
00:33:25,141 --> 00:33:27,460
Come on!

455
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:35,460
Sid, we're gonna get you
out of here, okay? Are you okay?

456
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,780
They sell this costume
at every five-and-dime in the state.

457
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,420
There's no way
to track the purchase.

458
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,660
What about that cellular
phone bill?

459
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:49,339
We're pulling Loomis's account.
We won't know anything
until the morning.

460
00:33:49,379 --> 00:33:52,659
Oh, come on!

461
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:56,299
- You think he did it?
- Twenty years ago,
I would've said, "Not a chance."

462
00:33:56,379 --> 00:34:00,979
But these kids today...
damned if I know.

463
00:34:01,059 --> 00:34:04,139
- Hey, Dewey, can we go now?
- Hold on a second.

464
00:34:04,219 --> 00:34:07,459
- Goddamn it, Dewey!
- What did Mama tell you?

465
00:34:07,499 --> 00:34:10,018
When I wear this badge,
you treat me like a man of the law!

466
00:34:10,098 --> 00:34:12,218
I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy,
but we're ready to go.

467
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:15,138
- Now, okay?
- Whoa.

468
00:34:15,218 --> 00:34:19,018
Take 'em out the back way.
Avoid that circus out there.

469
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:21,898
- Come on.
- Don't touch me!

470
00:34:21,978 --> 00:34:25,258
- He's my superior.
- Janitors are your superior.

471
00:34:27,618 --> 00:34:29,457
Let's get back to work!

472
00:34:34,937 --> 00:34:37,617
- Isn't there a back way
out of this building?
- Yeah.

473
00:34:37,697 --> 00:34:40,017
Down that alley, I think.

474
00:34:42,777 --> 00:34:45,577
You guys just stay here.
I'm gonna get the car.

475
00:34:45,657 --> 00:34:47,497
Don't move.
Don't make a sound.

476
00:34:49,177 --> 00:34:52,056
There she is. Sidney!

477
00:34:52,096 --> 00:34:55,136
Hi, that's some night.
What happened? Are you all right?

478
00:34:55,216 --> 00:34:57,496
She's not answering any questions.
Just leave us alone.

479
00:34:57,536 --> 00:34:59,896
No, Tatum, it's okay.
She's just doin' her job, right, Gale?

480
00:34:59,936 --> 00:35:03,256
- Yes, that's right.
- So, how's the book?

481
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:05,216
Well, it'll be out
later this year.

482
00:35:05,296 --> 00:35:07,496
Oh, I'll look for it.

483
00:35:07,576 --> 00:35:10,336
I'll send you a copy.

484
00:35:10,416 --> 00:35:12,495
Jeez.

485
00:35:12,575 --> 00:35:15,015
- Nice shot.
- Bitch.

486
00:35:15,095 --> 00:35:18,055
- No, I mean, camera shot.
- Where'd you learn to punch like that?

487
00:35:18,135 --> 00:35:20,935
God, I loved it.
"I'll send you a copy."

488
00:35:21,015 --> 00:35:22,855
Bam! Bitch went down.

489
00:35:22,935 --> 00:35:26,935
"I'll send you a copy."
Bam! Sid... Superbitch!

490
00:35:27,015 --> 00:35:28,895
You are so cool.

491
00:35:28,935 --> 00:35:31,135
Thought you might want
some ice for that right hook.

492
00:35:31,215 --> 00:35:33,294
Thanks.

493
00:35:33,374 --> 00:35:36,894
I'll be right next door.
Try to get some sleep.

494
00:35:36,974 --> 00:35:38,814
Yeah, yeah.

495
00:35:42,334 --> 00:35:46,334
- Do you really think Billy did it?

496
00:35:46,414 --> 00:35:48,254
He was there, Tatum.

497
00:35:48,334 --> 00:35:52,653
He was destined to have a flaw.
I knew he was too perfect.

498
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:55,053
- Telephone, honey.

499
00:35:55,133 --> 00:35:56,973
- Who is it?
- It's for Sid.

500
00:35:57,053 --> 00:35:58,733
My dad?

501
00:35:58,813 --> 00:36:01,533
- I don't think so.
- Take a message.

502
00:36:01,613 --> 00:36:03,453
No, um, I'll get it.

503
00:36:07,253 --> 00:36:09,533
How's she doin'?

504
00:36:11,533 --> 00:36:13,412
Hello.

505
00:36:13,492 --> 00:36:15,692
Hello, Sidney.

506
00:36:15,772 --> 00:36:17,812
No!

507
00:36:17,852 --> 00:36:19,732
Poor Billy-boyfriend.

508
00:36:19,772 --> 00:36:22,492
An innocent guy
doesn't stand a chance with you.

509
00:36:22,572 --> 00:36:26,612
- Leave me alone!
- Looks like you fingered
the wrong guy... again.

510
00:36:26,692 --> 00:36:29,092
- Who are you?
- Dewey!
- Hang up, Sid.

511
00:36:29,172 --> 00:36:32,172
Don't worry.
You'll find out soon enough.

512
00:36:32,252 --> 00:36:35,011
- I promise.

513
00:36:35,091 --> 00:36:36,931
What?

514
00:36:39,891 --> 00:36:41,731
- What?
- What?

515
00:36:47,131 --> 00:36:49,011
Hello?

516
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:02,730
Sidney Prescott, who escaped
a vicious attack last night...

517
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:04,650
is the daughter
of Maureen Prescott...

518
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:07,010
who was brutally
killed last year...

519
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:09,330
when convicted murderer
Cotton Weary broke into their home...

520
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:11,850
and savagely raped
and tortured the deceased.

521
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:14,930
Cotton Weary is currently awaiting
appeal for the death sentence...

522
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:18,049
handed down after the young Sidney
testified against him.

523
00:37:18,129 --> 00:37:20,769
She was the key witness in
the state's case against the...

524
00:37:22,969 --> 00:37:25,449
It's never gonna stop, is it?

525
00:37:25,529 --> 00:37:28,129
Billy was released.

526
00:37:28,209 --> 00:37:32,569
His cellular bill was clean.
He didn't make those calls.

527
00:37:32,649 --> 00:37:35,089
We're checkin' every cellular account
in the county.

528
00:37:35,129 --> 00:37:39,368
Any calls made to you or Casey Becker
are being cross-referenced.

529
00:37:39,448 --> 00:37:41,928
It's gonna take some time,
but we'll find him.

530
00:37:42,008 --> 00:37:44,408
Okay?

531
00:38:00,327 --> 00:38:03,127
Don't worry, Sid, it's school.
You'll be safe here.

532
00:38:03,207 --> 00:38:05,527
So how does it feel
to be almost brutally butchered?

533
00:38:05,607 --> 00:38:08,767
- Hey, leave her alone!
- People wanna know.
They have a right to know.

534
00:38:08,847 --> 00:38:10,687
- Leave her alone.
- How does it feel?

535
00:38:10,767 --> 00:38:14,167
She just wants to get an education.
Turn that thing off.

536
00:38:14,247 --> 00:38:16,567
What?

537
00:38:16,647 --> 00:38:19,606
Just a sec.

538
00:38:28,726 --> 00:38:30,966
Stop right there.

539
00:38:31,046 --> 00:38:33,246
I'm not here to fight.
I just need to talk.

540
00:38:33,326 --> 00:38:35,766
- Kenny, camera, now!
- Off the record. No camera.

541
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:38,845
- Forget it.
- Please? You owe me.

542
00:38:38,925 --> 00:38:41,285
- I owe you shit!
- You owe my mother!

543
00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:45,845
Your mother's murder
was last year's hottest court case.

544
00:38:45,925 --> 00:38:47,885
Somebody was gonna write about it.

545
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:50,765
And it had to be you with all your lies
and bullshit theories.

546
00:38:50,805 --> 00:38:53,485
What is your problem?
You got what you wanted.

547
00:38:53,565 --> 00:38:57,645
Cotton Weary's in jail.
They're gonna gas him.
A book is not gonna change that.

548
00:38:59,964 --> 00:39:02,684
Do you still think
he's innocent?

549
00:39:02,764 --> 00:39:05,444
Your testimony put him away.
It doesn't really matter what I think.

550
00:39:05,524 --> 00:39:09,324
During the trial, you did
all those stories about me.
You called me a liar.

551
00:39:09,364 --> 00:39:11,484
I think you
falsely identified him, yes.

552
00:39:11,564 --> 00:39:14,924
- Have you talked to Cotton?
- Many times.

553
00:39:14,964 --> 00:39:16,884
And has his story changed?

554
00:39:16,924 --> 00:39:18,804
Not one word.

555
00:39:18,844 --> 00:39:21,323
He admits to having sex
with your mother, but that's all.

556
00:39:21,363 --> 00:39:23,563
He's lying.
She never would've touched him.

557
00:39:23,603 --> 00:39:25,923
He raped her,
and then he...

558
00:39:26,003 --> 00:39:28,763
He butchered her.
Her blood was all over his coat.

559
00:39:28,843 --> 00:39:30,683
He was drunk that night.

560
00:39:30,763 --> 00:39:33,363
He left his coat at your house
after your mother seduced him.

561
00:39:33,443 --> 00:39:37,443
- I saw him leave wearing it.
- No, you saw someone leave
wearing that coat.

562
00:39:37,523 --> 00:39:42,882
The same someone who planted it
in Cotton's car, framing him.

563
00:39:42,962 --> 00:39:46,922
No. Cotton murdered my mother.

564
00:39:49,042 --> 00:39:51,482
You're not so sure anymore,
are you?

565
00:39:52,962 --> 00:39:56,642
Nice welt, sweetie.
Let's go, Sid.

566
00:39:56,722 --> 00:39:58,562
The killer's still
on the loose, isn't he?

567
00:39:58,642 --> 00:40:00,922
- Come on, Sid.
- Those murders are related.

568
00:40:01,002 --> 00:40:03,681
I'm sorry I mangled your face.

569
00:40:03,761 --> 00:40:06,721
- Sidney, don't go!
- Just stop, all right?

570
00:40:12,041 --> 00:40:13,881
Jesus Christ!

571
00:40:13,961 --> 00:40:17,001
An innocent man on death row.
A killer still on the loose.

572
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:19,721
- Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.
- You wanna go live?

573
00:40:19,761 --> 00:40:22,920
- Not so fast. We don't have
anything concrete.
- You can't just sit on it.

574
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,960
I know!
That's why we need proof.

575
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,920
If I'm right about this,
I could save a man's life.

576
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,200
Do you know what that
could do for my book sales?

577
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,640
This is a mistake.
I shouldn't be here.

578
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:39,840
I want you to meet me right here
after class, okay, Sid?

579
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,120
All right.

580
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,639
Hey, I haven't seen Billy around.
Is he really pissed?

581
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:48,759
Oh, you mean after you
branded him the Candyman?

582
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:50,719
- No, his heart's broken. Ow!
- Stu!

583
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:01,359
Why are they doing this?

584
00:41:01,439 --> 00:41:04,598
Are you kidding me?
Look at this place. It's like Christmas.

585
00:41:04,678 --> 00:41:07,598
- Stupidity leak.
- Ow. Easy.

586
00:41:07,678 --> 00:41:10,318
Sidney!

587
00:41:10,398 --> 00:41:12,358
- Ow!
- Jesus, shit!

588
00:41:12,438 --> 00:41:15,078
It's just me.

589
00:41:15,158 --> 00:41:18,518
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You still think it's me.

590
00:41:18,598 --> 00:41:20,918
No. No, I-I don't.

591
00:41:20,998 --> 00:41:24,278
It's just...
somebody was there.

592
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:26,277
Billy, someone tried to kill me.

593
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:30,117
I know, I know. The cops said
I scared him away. It wasn't me, Sid.

594
00:41:30,157 --> 00:41:34,397
I know. He called me again
last night at Tatum's house.

595
00:41:34,477 --> 00:41:37,157
You see? It couldn't have
been me. I was in jail.

596
00:41:37,197 --> 00:41:39,077
Remember?

597
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:43,717
I'm so... sorry.
Please understand.

598
00:41:43,757 --> 00:41:45,636
Understand what?

599
00:41:45,676 --> 00:41:48,116
That I have a girlfriend
who would rather accuse me...

600
00:41:48,196 --> 00:41:50,796
of being a psychopathic killer
than touch me?

601
00:41:50,876 --> 00:41:53,876
You know that's not true.

602
00:41:53,956 --> 00:41:56,596
- Then what is it?
- What... is it?

603
00:41:56,676 --> 00:41:59,356
Billy, I was attacked
and nearly filleted last night!

604
00:41:59,436 --> 00:42:01,276
I mean between us.

605
00:42:01,356 --> 00:42:04,036
You haven't been
the same since...

606
00:42:05,516 --> 00:42:08,115
- Since your mother died.
- Is your brain leaking?

607
00:42:08,195 --> 00:42:10,595
My mom was killed.
I can't believe you're bringing this up!

608
00:42:10,635 --> 00:42:14,715
- It's been a year.
- Tomorrow! One year tomorrow.

609
00:42:14,795 --> 00:42:16,635
I think it's time
you got over that.

610
00:42:16,715 --> 00:42:19,875
When my mom left my dad,
I accepted it. That's the way it is.

611
00:42:19,915 --> 00:42:21,755
She's not coming back.

612
00:42:21,835 --> 00:42:24,795
Your parents split up.
This is not the same thing.

613
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,714
Your mom left town.
She's not lying in a coffin somewhere.

614
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:30,674
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
It's a bad analogy.

615
00:42:30,754 --> 00:42:32,914
It's just that...

616
00:42:32,994 --> 00:42:35,874
I want my girlfriend back.

617
00:42:38,074 --> 00:42:39,914
Sid!

618
00:42:39,994 --> 00:42:41,834
Billy, I am sorry
if my traumatized life...

619
00:42:41,914 --> 00:42:44,714
is an inconvenience to you
and your perfect existence.

620
00:42:44,794 --> 00:42:47,834
What? Wh...
Nobody said that. Sid!

621
00:42:49,513 --> 00:42:51,353
Stupid.

622
00:42:51,433 --> 00:42:53,473
You make me so sick!

623
00:42:53,553 --> 00:42:57,833
Your entire havoc-inducing, thieving,
whoring generation disgusts me!

624
00:42:57,913 --> 00:43:02,153
So, two of
your fellow students...

625
00:43:02,233 --> 00:43:04,353
just savagely murdered...

626
00:43:04,393 --> 00:43:07,513
and this is the way you show
your compassion and sensitivity, huh?

627
00:43:07,593 --> 00:43:10,792
Let me tell you something.
You're both expelled! Get out!

628
00:43:10,872 --> 00:43:13,992
Come on, Mr. Himbry!
It was just a joke.

629
00:43:14,072 --> 00:43:15,912
That's not fair!

630
00:43:18,952 --> 00:43:21,512
You're absolutely right.
It is not fair.

631
00:43:21,592 --> 00:43:23,832
Fairness would be
to rip your insides out...

632
00:43:23,912 --> 00:43:25,952
hang you from a tree
so we can expose you...

633
00:43:25,992 --> 00:43:28,872
for the heartless,
desensitized little shits that you are.

634
00:43:40,471 --> 00:43:43,271
She was never attacked.
I think she made it all up.

635
00:43:43,351 --> 00:43:45,511
- Why would she lie about it?
- For attention!

636
00:43:45,591 --> 00:43:47,751
The girl has some serious issues.

637
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:55,470
What if she did it?

638
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,910
What if Sidney killed
Casey and Steve?

639
00:43:57,990 --> 00:43:59,830
Why would she do that?

640
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:03,070
Maybe she had the hots for Steve
and killed them both in a jealous rage.

641
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:07,870
What would Sidney want with Steve?
She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend.

642
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:11,190
Maybe she's a slut
just like her mother.

643
00:44:11,269 --> 00:44:14,429
- You're evil.
- Please, it's a common fact.

644
00:44:14,469 --> 00:44:18,269
- Her mother was a tramp.
- Cut some slack. She watched
her mom get butchered.

645
00:44:18,309 --> 00:44:20,469
And it fucked her up royally.
Think about it.

646
00:44:20,549 --> 00:44:23,029
Her mother's death leaves her
disturbed and hostile.

647
00:44:23,109 --> 00:44:26,509
In a cruel and inhumane world,
she's delusional.

648
00:44:26,589 --> 00:44:29,429
Where is God? Etcetera.
Completely suicidal.

649
00:44:29,509 --> 00:44:32,148
One day she snaps.
She wants to kill herself...

650
00:44:32,228 --> 00:44:35,508
but she realizes that teen suicide
is out this year...

651
00:44:35,588 --> 00:44:39,348
and homicide is a much healthier,
therapeutic expression.

652
00:44:39,428 --> 00:44:42,228
- Where do you get this shit?
- Ricki Lake.

653
00:44:42,308 --> 00:44:45,308
You are pathetic.

654
00:44:57,667 --> 00:45:00,067
Pathetic.

655
00:45:25,986 --> 00:45:28,106
Sidney.

656
00:45:32,546 --> 00:45:34,385
Is someone there?

657
00:46:12,424 --> 00:46:14,304
In what appears to be a prank...

658
00:46:14,344 --> 00:46:16,903
several students were seen
wearing scary masks.

659
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:18,823
School officials
have yet to comment...

660
00:46:18,903 --> 00:46:22,623
but this is known to be
the same costume worn by the killer.

661
00:46:22,663 --> 00:46:26,623
Seventeen-year-old Casey Becker
and her boyfriend Steven Orth
have already lost their lives.

662
00:46:26,703 --> 00:46:28,543
Who's next?

663
00:46:28,623 --> 00:46:32,303
You can literally feel
the fear on this campus.

664
00:46:32,383 --> 00:46:35,303
Hi! Gale Weathers,
field correspondent, "Top Story."

665
00:46:35,383 --> 00:46:37,222
I know who you are,
Miss Weathers.

666
00:46:37,302 --> 00:46:41,502
- How's the eye?
- It's productive.
Is there a problem on campus?

667
00:46:41,582 --> 00:46:43,422
No, everything's under control.

668
00:46:43,502 --> 00:46:46,982
- Of course. You're here.
- You're not supposed to be here.

669
00:46:47,062 --> 00:46:49,942
I know. I should be in New York
covering the Sharon Stone stalker...

670
00:46:50,022 --> 00:46:51,902
but who knew?

671
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:54,342
You look awfully young
to be a police officer.

672
00:46:54,422 --> 00:46:56,902
I'm 25 years old.

673
00:46:56,982 --> 00:46:58,821
You know, in a demographic study...

674
00:46:58,901 --> 00:47:02,141
I proved to be most popular
amongst males 11 to 24.

675
00:47:02,221 --> 00:47:06,501
Guess I just missed you.
Of course, you don't look a day over 12.

676
00:47:06,581 --> 00:47:08,821
Except in that
upper torso area.

677
00:47:08,861 --> 00:47:12,061
- Does the force require you to work out?
- No, ma'am.

678
00:47:12,141 --> 00:47:13,981
'Cause of my boyish good looks...

679
00:47:14,061 --> 00:47:17,701
muscle mass has increased my acceptance
as a serious police officer.

680
00:47:17,781 --> 00:47:20,300
I need your attention now, kids.

681
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:22,340
Due to the recent events
that have occurred...

682
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:26,260
effective immediately, all classes
are suspended until further notice.

683
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:30,700
- The Woodsboro police department
has issued a citywide curfew...

684
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:34,380
beginning at 9:00 tonight.

685
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:36,300
Looks like we've got
a serial killer on our hands.

686
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:38,260
Serial killer's
not really accurate.

687
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:41,019
Gotta knock off
a couple more to get that title.

688
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:44,019
Well, we can hope, can't we?

689
00:47:44,059 --> 00:47:47,059
I mean, we certainly
don't have any leads.

690
00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:50,099
- Have you located Sidney's father yet?
- No, not yet.

691
00:47:50,139 --> 00:47:55,259
- He's not a suspect, is he?
- We haven't ruled him out
as a... possibility.

692
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:58,699
- If you'll excuse me.
- I'm sorry. Am I keeping you?

693
00:47:58,779 --> 00:48:02,378
If I may say so,
Miss Weathers...

694
00:48:02,458 --> 00:48:05,818
you are much prettier in person.

695
00:48:05,898 --> 00:48:07,978
So you do watch the show.

696
00:48:09,538 --> 00:48:14,458
I'm 25.
I was 24 for a whole year.

697
00:48:14,538 --> 00:48:17,698
Please, call me Gale!

698
00:48:17,778 --> 00:48:20,018
It was just some sick fuck
having a laugh, Sidney.

699
00:48:20,058 --> 00:48:22,217
No, it was him, Tatum.
I know it.

700
00:48:22,297 --> 00:48:26,057
You're not to pee alone anymore.
If you pee, I pee. Is that clear?

701
00:48:26,137 --> 00:48:28,617
"Kizzo-kaskizzo is is-out."

702
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:30,537
I don't know what you did, Sidney.

703
00:48:30,617 --> 00:48:32,617
But on behalf of the entire
student body, we all say, "Thank you!"

704
00:48:32,697 --> 00:48:35,017
- Drop it, Stu.
- I say...

705
00:48:35,097 --> 00:48:37,737
an impromptu party tonight,
my house.

706
00:48:37,817 --> 00:48:39,657
Celebrate this little siesta.
What do you say?

707
00:48:39,737 --> 00:48:41,576
Are you serious?

708
00:48:41,656 --> 00:48:43,496
This little vixen...

709
00:48:43,576 --> 00:48:45,776
doesn't invite the entire world,
we'll be fine.

710
00:48:45,816 --> 00:48:48,176
Intimate gathering,
intimate friends.

711
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:50,096
What do you say, Sid?

712
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:52,016
I mean, pathos could
have its perks.

713
00:48:52,056 --> 00:48:54,416
Totally protected.
Yo, I am so buff.

714
00:48:54,456 --> 00:48:56,456
I got you covered, girl.

715
00:48:56,536 --> 00:49:00,296
Come on, Sid. For me?
It could be fun.

716
00:49:01,256 --> 00:49:03,455
Okay. Whatever.

717
00:49:03,535 --> 00:49:05,375
Yeah? Nice.

718
00:49:05,455 --> 00:49:07,295
Cool. You guys
bring food, all right?

719
00:49:24,534 --> 00:49:26,414
Yes?

720
00:49:26,454 --> 00:49:28,334
Hello?

721
00:50:01,413 --> 00:50:04,493
- Damn little shits.
- What'd you call me? Huh?

722
00:50:04,573 --> 00:50:07,212
- Not you, Fred.
- You prick.

723
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:59,010
Aaaah! Aaah!

724
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:01,130
Ohhhhh!

725
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:14,609
School's out for summer

726
00:51:17,089 --> 00:51:19,889
- School's out 
- What if Cotton Weary
is telling the truth?

727
00:51:19,969 --> 00:51:23,049
Maybe he was having
an affair with your mom.

728
00:51:23,089 --> 00:51:27,009
I mean, your dad was always out of town
on business. Maybe...

729
00:51:27,089 --> 00:51:30,048
Maybe your mom was just
a very unhappy woman.

730
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:33,928
If they were having an affair, how come
Cotton couldn't prove it in court?

731
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:38,608
Well, you can't prove a rumor.
That's why it's a rumor.

732
00:51:38,688 --> 00:51:42,568
Right. Created by that
little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.

733
00:51:43,888 --> 00:51:46,368
It goes further back, Sid.

734
00:51:46,448 --> 00:51:49,247
There's been talk
about other men.

735
00:51:49,327 --> 00:51:51,687
And you believe it.

736
00:51:51,767 --> 00:51:57,327
Well, you can only hear
that Richard Gere gerbil story
so many times...

737
00:51:57,407 --> 00:52:00,207
before you have to start
believing it.

738
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:05,927
Oh, I'm sorry.

739
00:52:08,367 --> 00:52:11,206
Y-You know, if I was wrong
about Cotton Weary...

740
00:52:11,246 --> 00:52:13,126
then... the killer's
still out there.

741
00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:15,046
Don't go there, Sid.

742
00:52:15,086 --> 00:52:18,086
You're starting to sound like some
Wes Carpenter flick or something.

743
00:52:18,166 --> 00:52:21,966
Don't freak yourself, okay? We've got
a long night ahead of us. Okay?

744
00:52:22,966 --> 00:52:24,846
Let's boogie.

745
00:52:28,366 --> 00:52:30,206
It's alive!

746
00:52:30,286 --> 00:52:34,045
- Henry...
- Oh, in the name of God,
now I know...

747
00:52:34,125 --> 00:52:35,965
Excuse me, dude.

748
00:52:37,645 --> 00:52:39,525
- Watch it, jerk.
- I'm sorry.

749
00:52:41,805 --> 00:52:43,685
Ohhhh!

750
00:52:43,725 --> 00:52:46,005
Dork.

751
00:52:46,085 --> 00:52:48,885
Jesus, this place
is packed tonight, man.

752
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:52,244
- We had a run
in the mass murder section.
- Comin' to my fiesta?

753
00:52:52,324 --> 00:52:54,724
Yeah, I'm off early.
Curfew, you know.

754
00:52:54,804 --> 00:52:57,644
What's that werewolf movie
with E.T.'s mom in it?

755
00:52:57,684 --> 00:53:00,644
- "The Howling."
Horror. Straight ahead.
- Okay, thanks.

756
00:53:02,124 --> 00:53:05,604
- Oh, now that's in poor taste.
- What?

757
00:53:05,684 --> 00:53:09,484
If you were the only suspect
in a senseless bloodbath...

758
00:53:09,524 --> 00:53:12,363
would you be standing
in the horror section?

759
00:53:12,403 --> 00:53:16,163
What? It was just a misunderstanding.
He didn't do anything.

760
00:53:16,203 --> 00:53:18,083
You're such a little lapdog.

761
00:53:18,123 --> 00:53:21,443
- He's got "killer" printed
all over his forehead.
- Ohhh-kay!

762
00:53:21,523 --> 00:53:25,083
Really? Well, why'd the cops
let him go, smart guy?

763
00:53:25,163 --> 00:53:29,083
Obviously they don't
watch enough movies. This is
standard horror movie stuff.

764
00:53:29,163 --> 00:53:33,602
- "Prom Night" revisited, man.
- Yeah? Why would he wanna
kill his own girlfriend?

765
00:53:33,642 --> 00:53:36,602
There's always some stupid,
bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend.

766
00:53:36,682 --> 00:53:40,082
- Oh?
- That's the beauty of it all:
Simplicity.

767
00:53:40,162 --> 00:53:43,682
Besides, if it gets too complicated,
you lose your target audience.

768
00:53:43,722 --> 00:53:45,722
Well, what's his reason?

769
00:53:45,802 --> 00:53:48,162
Maybe Sidney
wouldn't have sex with him.

770
00:53:48,202 --> 00:53:51,562
- What, is she
savin' herself for you?
- Maybe.

771
00:53:51,642 --> 00:53:56,121
Now that Billy tried to mutilate her,
do you think Sid would go out with me?

772
00:54:01,401 --> 00:54:03,681
No, I don't at all. No.

773
00:54:03,721 --> 00:54:06,961
You know who I think it is?

774
00:54:07,041 --> 00:54:09,561
You know, I think it's her father.

775
00:54:09,641 --> 00:54:11,961
Why can't they find her pops, man?

776
00:54:12,041 --> 00:54:14,041
Because he's probably dead.

777
00:54:14,121 --> 00:54:17,520
His body will come poppin' up
in the last reel somewhere!

778
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:21,320
Eyes gouged out, fingers cut off,
teeth knocked out!

779
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,000
- The police are always
off track with this shit.
- Man!

780
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:26,440
If they'd watch "Prom Night,"
they'd save time.

781
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:30,280
There's a formula to it.
A very simple formula!
Everybody's a suspect!

782
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:38,679
I'm telling you, the dad's
a red herring. It's Billy.

783
00:54:40,199 --> 00:54:42,999
How do we know
you're not the killer? Huh?

784
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:45,479
- Huh?
- Hi, Billy.

785
00:54:45,559 --> 00:54:48,799
Maybe your movie-freaked mind lost its
reality button. You ever think of that?

786
00:54:48,839 --> 00:54:51,679
You're absolutely right.
I'm the first to admit it.

787
00:54:51,719 --> 00:54:55,039
- If this were a scary movie,
I'd be the prime suspect.
- That's right.

788
00:54:55,079 --> 00:54:56,958
And what would be your motive?

789
00:54:56,998 --> 00:54:59,078
It's the millennium.

790
00:54:59,158 --> 00:55:00,998
Motives are incidental.

791
00:55:01,078 --> 00:55:02,998
"Millennium." Hmm.

792
00:55:03,078 --> 00:55:07,198
"Millennium." I like that.
That's good. It's the millennium.

793
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:10,118
Good kid.

794
00:55:11,198 --> 00:55:14,198
"Millennium."
Good word, my man.

795
00:55:14,278 --> 00:55:16,158
Are you telling me
that's not a killer?

796
00:55:18,877 --> 00:55:21,437
You'll see him
in your nightmares

797
00:55:21,477 --> 00:55:24,157
You'll see him
in your dreams

798
00:55:27,077 --> 00:55:29,717
He'll appear
out of nowhere

799
00:55:29,797 --> 00:55:31,957
But he ain't

800
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:34,557
What he seems

801
00:55:34,637 --> 00:55:37,197
You'll see him
in your head

802
00:55:37,277 --> 00:55:39,156
On the TV screen

803
00:55:39,236 --> 00:55:42,716
Hey, buddy, I'm warnin' you
to turn it off

804
00:55:42,796 --> 00:55:45,076
Ah, he's a ghost
He's a god

805
00:55:45,156 --> 00:55:48,156
He's a man
He's a guru

806
00:55:49,636 --> 00:55:54,236
You're one microscopic cog
in his catastrophic plan

807
00:55:54,276 --> 00:55:58,036
Designed and directed
by his red right hand

808
00:55:59,075 --> 00:56:00,915
Sure is quiet.

809
00:56:00,995 --> 00:56:02,835
God, look at this place.

810
00:56:02,915 --> 00:56:05,155
It's "The Town
That Dreaded Sundown."

811
00:56:05,235 --> 00:56:08,515
Yeah, I saw that movie.
It's about a killer in Texas, huh?

812
00:56:08,595 --> 00:56:10,435
- Mmm.
- Hey, Sid, just think.

813
00:56:10,515 --> 00:56:13,315
If they make a movie about you,
who's gonna play you?

814
00:56:13,395 --> 00:56:16,835
- I shudder to think.
- I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.

815
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:20,194
Thanks, Dewey. With my luck,
they'd cast Tori Spelling.

816
00:56:20,274 --> 00:56:23,074
I'm just gonna be
a few minutes.

817
00:56:23,154 --> 00:56:24,994
You girls don't go too far.

818
00:56:27,394 --> 00:56:29,274
Is Billy gonna be there tonight?

819
00:56:29,314 --> 00:56:32,274
He'd better not be.
I told Stu to keep his mouth shut.

820
00:56:32,354 --> 00:56:35,154
I think we can live without
the endorphin rush for one night.

821
00:56:36,754 --> 00:56:40,033
Billy's right, you know. Whenever he
touches me, I just can't relax.

822
00:56:40,113 --> 00:56:43,553
So you have a few
intimacy issues as a result of
your mother's untimely death.

823
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:46,033
That's no big deal.
You'll thaw out.

824
00:56:46,113 --> 00:56:49,393
Yeah, but he has been so patient
with me with all the sex stuff.

825
00:56:49,473 --> 00:56:52,953
How many guys would put up with
a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?

826
00:56:53,033 --> 00:56:55,873
Billy and his penis
don't deserve you, all right?

827
00:57:03,952 --> 00:57:05,792
Dewey, where the hell you been?

828
00:57:05,872 --> 00:57:08,672
I was keepin' an eye
on Sidney, uh...

829
00:57:09,952 --> 00:57:14,392
- Thought you quit.
- I did. But damn it...

830
00:57:14,432 --> 00:57:17,592
Dewey, Vital Phone
just faxed us.

831
00:57:17,672 --> 00:57:21,911
Those calls are listed
to Neil Prescott, Sidney's father.

832
00:57:21,951 --> 00:57:25,431
He made the calls with a cellular phone.
It's been confirmed.

833
00:57:26,671 --> 00:57:29,471
There's no way a cellular
coulda been cloned?

834
00:57:29,551 --> 00:57:32,191
There's more.
Guess what tomorrow is.

835
00:57:32,271 --> 00:57:34,711
The anniversary
of his wife's death.

836
00:57:37,471 --> 00:57:40,311
We'll keep the roadblocks and
the curfew in effect through the night.

837
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:43,510
If he's not picked up by morning,
then we'll do a house-to-house.

838
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:46,470
- Where's Sidney?
- She's with my sister.

839
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:49,910
- You want me to bring her in?
- Naw.

840
00:57:49,990 --> 00:57:51,870
Not just yet.

841
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:55,230
Let's find Neil first,
make sure he's our man.

842
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,749
You stay close to Sidney.

843
00:58:04,829 --> 00:58:07,309
Don't let her
out of your sight.

844
00:58:07,389 --> 00:58:09,549
Yes, sir.

845
00:58:28,308 --> 00:58:31,788
Say a prayer
for the youth of America

846
00:58:34,628 --> 00:58:37,628
God bless the youth
of America

847
00:58:40,348 --> 00:58:42,748
I can't stand
their sight anymore

848
00:58:42,828 --> 00:58:44,947
- All right, you girls have fun.

849
00:58:45,027 --> 00:58:47,867
Not too much fun,
or I'll bust ya.

850
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:50,907
- Bye.
- Bye, Sid.

851
00:58:52,867 --> 00:58:58,987
You're obsessed

852
00:58:59,067 --> 00:59:03,107
You're obsessed

853
00:59:03,187 --> 00:59:05,027
- Here, kids!

854
00:59:07,346 --> 00:59:09,186
Oh! That's absurd.

855
00:59:09,266 --> 00:59:12,066
You guys were tardy for the party,
so we started without you.

856
00:59:12,146 --> 00:59:14,026
- My man!

857
00:59:28,145 --> 00:59:29,985
Shh.

858
00:59:31,145 --> 00:59:32,985
Were we spotted?

859
00:59:33,065 --> 00:59:35,865
I don't think so.
Go get the camera.

860
00:59:38,305 --> 00:59:40,545
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare ya.

861
00:59:40,625 --> 00:59:43,665
- Deputy, that's okay.
- What brings you to these parts?

862
00:59:43,745 --> 00:59:47,704
Well, you just never know
when or where a story will break.

863
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:51,664
Not much of a story here.
Just a bunch of kids cuttin' it loose.

864
00:59:51,744 --> 00:59:54,384
Then what are you doing here?

865
00:59:56,864 --> 00:59:59,224
Just keepin' an eye on things.

866
00:59:59,264 --> 01:00:02,104
I'm gonna check the party out.

867
01:00:02,144 --> 01:00:05,464
- Do you mind if I join you?
- Not at all.

868
01:00:06,464 --> 01:00:09,623
Let me just get my coat. Thanks.

869
01:00:14,623 --> 01:00:17,463
- All right.
- Yeah, I'm fine.

870
01:00:17,543 --> 01:00:19,383
Oh! Yeah.

871
01:00:21,463 --> 01:00:24,303
- How many "Evil Deads"?
- One! Two!

872
01:00:24,343 --> 01:00:26,543
- How many "Hellraisers"?
- Hellraiser right here.

873
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:29,942
"The Fog," "Terror Train,"
"Prom Night."

874
01:00:29,982 --> 01:00:33,302
How come Jamie Lee Curtis
is in all of these movies?

875
01:00:33,342 --> 01:00:35,782
She's the... scream queen.

876
01:00:35,862 --> 01:00:38,902
- With a set of lungs
like that, she should be.
- Yeah.

877
01:00:38,982 --> 01:00:40,462
Tits. See?

878
01:00:40,542 --> 01:00:42,422
- Oh, I'll get it.

879
01:00:43,902 --> 01:00:46,262
Hey, Tate, grab another beer,
would ya?

880
01:00:46,302 --> 01:00:48,622
- There's more
beer in the garage.

881
01:00:48,662 --> 01:00:50,541
What am I, the beer wench?

882
01:00:50,581 --> 01:00:53,421
- She was nominated for "Terror Train."
- Oh, yeah?

883
01:00:53,461 --> 01:00:56,301
You are not gonna believe who's here!
It's that chick from "Top Story"!

884
01:00:56,341 --> 01:00:58,181
- Gale Weathers?
- Here. Yeah.

885
01:01:00,981 --> 01:01:02,861
You're under age, son.

886
01:01:02,901 --> 01:01:04,781
I'm kiddin'.
Have a good time.

887
01:01:04,821 --> 01:01:06,541
- Dewey.
- Hi.

888
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:09,581
Dewey.

889
01:01:09,621 --> 01:01:12,620
- What is she doing here?
- She's with me!

890
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:14,980
- I'm just checkin' things out.
- So you did.

891
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:19,220
Now leave, and take
your media mouth with you.

892
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:23,340
- I just think you're awesome.
- Oh, thank you very much.

893
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:25,260
- I watch your show religiously.
- That's great.

894
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:27,620
- Hey.
- Hey.

895
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:30,180
- I need a camera.

896
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:33,379
- Have you found my father?
- I'm afraid not.

897
01:01:35,059 --> 01:01:37,419
- Should I be worried?
- Not yet.

898
01:01:39,419 --> 01:01:42,779
- Get out, you're walkin' 
- That's the one
I want..."Halloween."

899
01:01:42,859 --> 01:01:46,179
- Too bad, I've spoken

900
01:01:46,259 --> 01:01:48,739
When I look at you
you're forgiven

901
01:02:02,498 --> 01:02:04,458
Mmm.

902
01:02:04,498 --> 01:02:06,418
You're forgiven

903
01:02:24,537 --> 01:02:27,057
- Jesus!

904
01:02:29,337 --> 01:02:31,817
Tatum, it's okay.

905
01:02:41,216 --> 01:02:43,056
Shit.

906
01:02:47,376 --> 01:02:49,256
Hey, shitheads!

907
01:02:50,736 --> 01:02:52,616
Hello!

908
01:02:53,896 --> 01:02:56,735
Shit. Piss.

909
01:03:13,295 --> 01:03:14,855
Is that you, Randy?

910
01:03:17,334 --> 01:03:20,654
Cute. What movie is this from?
"I Spit On Your Garage"?

911
01:03:22,574 --> 01:03:25,734
Lose the outfit.
If Sidney sees it, she'll flip.

912
01:03:25,814 --> 01:03:28,654
Oh, you wanna play psycho killer?

913
01:03:28,694 --> 01:03:31,294
Can I be the helpless victim?

914
01:03:31,374 --> 01:03:34,654
Okay, let's see... No, please
don't kill me, Mr. Ghost Face.

915
01:03:34,734 --> 01:03:37,133
I wanna be in the sequel!

916
01:03:38,453 --> 01:03:41,573
Cut, Casper.
That's a wrap.

917
01:03:43,373 --> 01:03:46,573
Randy, what the hell
are you doing? Aaah!

918
01:03:48,733 --> 01:03:50,733
Aaah! Stop!

919
01:03:57,452 --> 01:03:59,172
Aaaah!

920
01:04:05,132 --> 01:04:07,652
Fucker!

921
01:04:07,692 --> 01:04:09,732
Aaah!

922
01:04:27,091 --> 01:04:36,091
- Aaah! Aaaah!

923
01:04:36,171 --> 01:04:39,330
Aaaaah!

924
01:04:39,370 --> 01:04:42,650
No! No!

925
01:04:58,570 --> 01:05:01,489
- Happy curfew.
- Nice party, Stu.

926
01:05:01,569 --> 01:05:04,369
- Tatum, come on!
- There's nobody here
but us chickens!

927
01:05:04,449 --> 01:05:07,289
- Do you know where she is?
- No, I haven't seen her.

928
01:05:07,369 --> 01:05:09,129
- Aaah!

929
01:05:09,209 --> 01:05:11,649
Oh. Billy. Hey.

930
01:05:11,729 --> 01:05:13,609
Billy. Hmm.
What are you doin' here?

931
01:05:13,649 --> 01:05:16,329
I was hoping I could talk
to Sid alone.

932
01:05:16,409 --> 01:05:19,449
You know, if Tatum sees you here,
she'll draw blood.

933
01:05:19,529 --> 01:05:22,328
Why don't you go up
to my parents' room?

934
01:05:22,408 --> 01:05:25,688
You know, you guys
can talk, whatever.

935
01:05:25,768 --> 01:05:28,088
Subtlety, Stu.
You should look it up.

936
01:05:29,168 --> 01:05:32,008
No, i-it's okay.
We do need to talk.

937
01:05:34,248 --> 01:05:36,128
Oooh! Oww.

938
01:05:41,127 --> 01:05:42,967
What's Leatherface doin' here?

939
01:05:43,047 --> 01:05:45,527
Cute. He came to make up.

940
01:05:45,607 --> 01:05:48,407
There goes my chance with Sid.
Damn it.

941
01:05:48,487 --> 01:05:50,487
As if. That's all I'm sayin'.

942
01:05:50,567 --> 01:05:52,407
As if.

943
01:05:52,487 --> 01:05:54,327
Oh, really, Alicia?

944
01:05:55,367 --> 01:05:58,087
"As if."
I'm gonna go check on them.

945
01:05:58,167 --> 01:06:01,047
- Come on!
- It was nice
to meet all of you.

946
01:06:04,206 --> 01:06:06,366
You're a genius.

947
01:06:06,446 --> 01:06:08,606
- Oh, shit.
- What?

948
01:06:08,686 --> 01:06:11,046
- I got a delay.
- How long is it?

949
01:06:11,086 --> 01:06:14,886
I don't know. What'd it take you
to walk from the house, 30 seconds?

950
01:06:14,926 --> 01:06:18,246
Lt'll be fine. Just record it.
Oh, the placement is perfect.

951
01:06:18,286 --> 01:06:19,686
- Tell me, Kenneth...
- Hmm?

952
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:23,045
Has a cheesy tabloid journalist
ever won the Pulitzer?

953
01:06:23,085 --> 01:06:25,205
Well, first time
for everything.

954
01:06:25,285 --> 01:06:27,125
You're damn right.

955
01:06:33,445 --> 01:06:35,285
S-So, um...

956
01:06:37,285 --> 01:06:39,125
- So...

957
01:06:41,965 --> 01:06:43,844
I'm sorry.

958
01:06:44,964 --> 01:06:48,724
I've been selfish,
and I want to apologize.

959
01:06:48,804 --> 01:06:51,804
No, Billy, I-I'm...

960
01:06:51,884 --> 01:06:55,324
the one who's been selfish
and self-absorbed...

961
01:06:55,364 --> 01:06:58,044
with all this
post-traumatic stress.

962
01:06:59,364 --> 01:07:03,164
- You lost your mom.
- Yeah, I know, but you're right.

963
01:07:03,244 --> 01:07:05,123
Enough is enough.

964
01:07:05,163 --> 01:07:08,003
I can't wallow in
the grief process forever...

965
01:07:08,043 --> 01:07:09,923
and...

966
01:07:11,403 --> 01:07:13,283
and I can't...

967
01:07:13,323 --> 01:07:17,403
keep lying to myself
about who my mom was.

968
01:07:21,043 --> 01:07:22,723
Yeah, I think
I'm really...

969
01:07:25,202 --> 01:07:27,362
scared...

970
01:07:27,442 --> 01:07:30,722
that I'm gonna turn out
just like her, you know?

971
01:07:31,842 --> 01:07:35,162
Like "The Bad Seed"
or somethin'.

972
01:07:35,242 --> 01:07:38,082
And I know it doesn't make sense.

973
01:07:39,202 --> 01:07:41,042
Yeah, it does.

974
01:07:42,882 --> 01:07:44,762
Hmm.

975
01:07:44,802 --> 01:07:48,121
It's like Jodie Foster in
"The Silence of the Lambs"...

976
01:07:48,161 --> 01:07:51,961
when she keeps having
flashbacks of her dead father.

977
01:07:52,001 --> 01:07:54,041
But this is life.

978
01:07:54,081 --> 01:07:55,961
This isn't a movie.

979
01:07:56,001 --> 01:07:58,441
Sure it is, Sid.

980
01:07:58,521 --> 01:08:00,361
It's all...
It's all a movie.

981
01:08:00,441 --> 01:08:02,281
It's all...

982
01:08:02,361 --> 01:08:04,201
one great big movie.

983
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:12,800
Only you can't pick your genre.

984
01:08:37,719 --> 01:08:40,599
Why can't I be a Meg Ryan movie?

985
01:08:43,519 --> 01:08:46,399
Or even a good porno.

986
01:08:48,838 --> 01:08:50,718
What?

987
01:08:50,758 --> 01:08:52,638
You heard me.

988
01:09:00,318 --> 01:09:02,158
Are you sure?

989
01:09:04,158 --> 01:09:05,998
Yeah.

990
01:09:06,078 --> 01:09:07,918
I think so.

991
01:09:23,917 --> 01:09:26,037
Look, look, look.
Here it comes.

992
01:09:26,117 --> 01:09:27,997
- Whoa!
- Ohh!

993
01:09:28,037 --> 01:09:31,836
The blood is all wrong!
Why do they do that? It's too red!

994
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:33,756
Wait. Here comes another.

995
01:09:35,596 --> 01:09:37,436
- Oooh! Oooh!
- Yes! Yes!

996
01:09:37,516 --> 01:09:39,836
Predictable.
I knew he was gonna bite it.

997
01:09:39,916 --> 01:09:42,716
- How can you watch
this shit over and over?
- Shh!

998
01:09:42,796 --> 01:09:45,116
I wanna see
Jamie Lee's breasts.

999
01:09:45,196 --> 01:09:47,516
- When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
- Breasts?

1000
01:09:47,596 --> 01:09:49,876
Not until "Trading Places" in '83.

1001
01:09:49,916 --> 01:09:52,275
Jamie Lee was always the virgin
in horror movies.

1002
01:09:52,315 --> 01:09:56,275
- She never showed her tits
'til she went legits.
- Could afford a decent pair.

1003
01:09:56,315 --> 01:10:00,555
That's why she always
outsmarted the killer in the
big chase scene at the end.

1004
01:10:00,635 --> 01:10:03,435
Only virgins can do that.
Don't you know the rules?

1005
01:10:03,515 --> 01:10:05,355
- What rules?
- You don't...

1006
01:10:07,435 --> 01:10:09,835
Jesus Christ.
You don't know the rules?

1007
01:10:09,915 --> 01:10:11,914
Have an aneurysm,
why don't ya?

1008
01:10:11,994 --> 01:10:14,794
There are certain rules
one must abide by...

1009
01:10:14,874 --> 01:10:17,594
in order to successfully
survive a horror movie.

1010
01:10:17,674 --> 01:10:20,554
For instance, number one:
You can never have sex.

1011
01:10:22,594 --> 01:10:24,754
Big no-no!
Big no-no!

1012
01:10:24,834 --> 01:10:26,554
I'd be a dead man.

1013
01:10:26,634 --> 01:10:28,474
Sex equals death. Okay?

1014
01:10:28,554 --> 01:10:31,514
Number two:
You can never drink or do drugs.

1015
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:36,153
No, the sin factor.

1016
01:10:36,233 --> 01:10:39,033
It's a sin.
It's an extension of number one.

1017
01:10:39,113 --> 01:10:42,673
And number three: Never, ever, ever
under any circumstances, say...

1018
01:10:42,713 --> 01:10:44,593
"I'll be right back,"
'cause you won't be back.

1019
01:10:44,633 --> 01:10:47,313
- I'm gettin' another beer.
You want one?
- Yeah, sure.

1020
01:10:47,353 --> 01:10:49,713
- I'll be right back!
- Ohhhh!

1021
01:10:51,993 --> 01:10:55,632
You push the laws and you end up dead.
See you in the kitchen with a knife.

1022
01:10:55,712 --> 01:10:59,032
Only virgins can outsmart the killer
in the big chase scene at the end.

1023
01:10:59,072 --> 01:11:01,432
- Don't you know the rules?
- What rules?

1024
01:11:01,512 --> 01:11:03,352
You don't know the rules?

1025
01:11:03,432 --> 01:11:07,472
- There are rules one must abide
by to survive a horror movie.
- Boring.

1026
01:11:07,512 --> 01:11:09,392
- For instance...

1027
01:11:10,592 --> 01:11:12,472
The sheriff just radioed.

1028
01:11:12,512 --> 01:11:16,071
Somebody reported a car
in the bushes down the road.
I'm gonna go check it out.

1029
01:11:16,151 --> 01:11:18,951
- Would you care to join me?
- I'd love to.

1030
01:11:19,031 --> 01:11:21,071
If you're sure it's all right.

1031
01:11:21,111 --> 01:11:24,791
Uh, ma'am,
I'm the deputy of this town.

1032
01:11:26,231 --> 01:11:28,111
Be right back.

1033
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:31,391
- Kids Shouting, Whooping]

1034
01:11:31,471 --> 01:11:33,551
You push the laws,
you end up dead.

1035
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:36,470
- W... Excuse me, ma'am.
- Mm-hmm?

1036
01:11:36,510 --> 01:11:38,390
I thought maybe we'd walk.

1037
01:11:39,590 --> 01:11:43,270
It's such a nice night out.
I got a flashlight.

1038
01:11:45,470 --> 01:11:47,670
You're not scared, are ya?

1039
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:49,590
No.

1040
01:11:49,630 --> 01:11:52,070
- All right.
- Great.

1041
01:11:55,709 --> 01:11:59,029
- Do you know what that constellation is?
- No. What is it?

1042
01:11:59,069 --> 01:12:03,189
- I don't know.
That's why I was askin' you.

1043
01:12:06,309 --> 01:12:08,149
What happened to Tatum, Stu?

1044
01:12:08,229 --> 01:12:10,989
She probably got pissed
at me and bailed. Bye.

1045
01:12:12,949 --> 01:12:14,829
No, I'm just kidding.

1046
01:12:30,708 --> 01:12:33,548
Look! Here comes
the obligatory tit shot!

1047
01:12:37,107 --> 01:12:38,947
- Yes! Oh! Beautiful!
- Lovely!

1048
01:12:39,027 --> 01:12:40,867
Ohh! Ohh.

1049
01:12:40,947 --> 01:12:43,507
- Oh, my God.
- I'll leave you guys alone.

1050
01:12:44,547 --> 01:12:46,387
You are so...

1051
01:12:47,907 --> 01:12:49,747
amazing.

1052
01:12:55,707 --> 01:12:58,306
- Hello? Yeah?

1053
01:13:02,466 --> 01:13:04,306
Holy shit.

1054
01:13:07,746 --> 01:13:09,546
Listen up.

1055
01:13:09,586 --> 01:13:11,346
They found
Principal Himbry dead.

1056
01:13:11,426 --> 01:13:15,266
He was gutted and hung from the goalpost
on the football field.

1057
01:13:15,346 --> 01:13:19,465
- What are we waiting for?
- Let's go over there
before they bring him down.

1058
01:13:19,505 --> 01:13:22,665
- Hey. Hey.
- To arms! To arms!

1059
01:13:22,705 --> 01:13:25,545
- Where did he say he was?
- At the football field!

1060
01:13:25,585 --> 01:13:28,705
- Come on!
- Where you guys goin'?

1061
01:13:28,785 --> 01:13:32,065
We were just gettin'
to the good part.

1062
01:13:32,145 --> 01:13:35,425
Hello? Yeah?

1063
01:13:46,064 --> 01:13:48,224
- Whoo!

1064
01:13:56,784 --> 01:13:59,743
Hi-ho, Silver! Let's go!

1065
01:13:59,823 --> 01:14:02,823
So, is... is Dewey
your real name?

1066
01:14:02,863 --> 01:14:04,743
No, it's Dwight.

1067
01:14:04,783 --> 01:14:06,663
Dwight?

1068
01:14:06,703 --> 01:14:08,903
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's all right.

1069
01:14:08,943 --> 01:14:12,583
Dewey's just somethin'
I got stuck with a long time ago.

1070
01:14:12,623 --> 01:14:14,983
Well, I like it.

1071
01:14:15,023 --> 01:14:16,903
Sexy.

1072
01:14:16,943 --> 01:14:19,543
- Sexy?
- Mm-hmm.

1073
01:14:19,623 --> 01:14:22,902
Ah, it's just this town's way
of not takin' me serious.

1074
01:14:22,982 --> 01:14:25,302
What about Gale Weathers?

1075
01:14:25,382 --> 01:14:28,342
Sounds like I'm a meteorologist
or something.

1076
01:14:29,542 --> 01:14:31,382
People treat me...

1077
01:14:31,462 --> 01:14:33,742
like I'm the antichrist
of television journalism.

1078
01:14:33,822 --> 01:14:35,662
- I don't think you're that bad.
- No?

1079
01:14:35,742 --> 01:14:37,582
- No? No.

1080
01:14:37,662 --> 01:14:39,502
That's just 'cause
you kinda like me.

1081
01:14:39,582 --> 01:14:42,181
- They sure are comin' fast.
Slow down!

1082
01:14:42,261 --> 01:14:45,821
- Freeze... Jump!

1083
01:14:47,821 --> 01:14:49,661
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

1084
01:14:49,741 --> 01:14:51,581
Yeah.

1085
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:04,620
I'm sorry.

1086
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:06,540
I'm on duty.

1087
01:15:13,620 --> 01:15:16,460
Is that what you're looking for?

1088
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:18,380
My whole life.

1089
01:15:23,219 --> 01:15:25,099
- Damn!
- What?

1090
01:15:25,139 --> 01:15:27,979
- What is it?
- This is Neil Prescott's car.

1091
01:15:28,019 --> 01:15:29,899
- Sidney's father?
- Yeah.

1092
01:15:31,179 --> 01:15:33,019
Jesus. What's he doing here?

1093
01:15:34,419 --> 01:15:36,739
We gotta get back.

1094
01:15:39,739 --> 01:15:41,579
You okay?

1095
01:15:43,139 --> 01:15:44,978
Yeah.

1096
01:15:45,058 --> 01:15:46,898
Yeah, I'm fine.

1097
01:15:57,138 --> 01:15:59,178
Who'd you call?

1098
01:15:59,258 --> 01:16:01,058
What?

1099
01:16:01,098 --> 01:16:04,897
Um, well, I don't know,
when you're arrested you're
allowed one phone call.

1100
01:16:04,937 --> 01:16:07,777
So I was just curious.
Who'd you call?

1101
01:16:09,257 --> 01:16:11,097
Called my dad.

1102
01:16:13,097 --> 01:16:16,537
No, um, Sheriff Burke
called your dad. I saw him.

1103
01:16:18,577 --> 01:16:22,497
Yeah, but when I called
I didn't get an answer.

1104
01:16:26,856 --> 01:16:28,736
Huh.

1105
01:16:33,096 --> 01:16:36,096
You don't still think
it was me, do ya?

1106
01:16:39,376 --> 01:16:41,256
No.

1107
01:16:41,336 --> 01:16:43,176
No.

1108
01:16:43,256 --> 01:16:48,135
I was just thinking, if it were
you it'd be a very clever way
to throw me off track.

1109
01:16:48,215 --> 01:16:52,695
You know, using your one phone call to
call me so I wouldn't think it was you.

1110
01:16:52,775 --> 01:16:54,935
Really.

1111
01:17:02,455 --> 01:17:06,814
What do I have to do to prove to you
that I'm not a killer?

1112
01:17:08,254 --> 01:17:10,814
- Oh, my God.
- Huh?

1113
01:17:11,974 --> 01:17:14,214
- Oh, my God.
- Sidney...
- Billy, watch out!

1114
01:17:15,254 --> 01:17:16,574
- Aaah!
- Aaaah!

1115
01:17:23,814 --> 01:17:25,854
Sid.

1116
01:17:34,693 --> 01:17:36,373
No!

1117
01:17:59,732 --> 01:18:02,852
- Shit!

1118
01:18:08,332 --> 01:18:11,891
Help me, somebody! Help me!

1119
01:18:29,771 --> 01:18:31,930
Help me!

1120
01:19:00,169 --> 01:19:03,889
No, Jamie.
Uh, watch out.

1121
01:19:03,969 --> 01:19:07,089
Watch out, Jamie.
You know he's around.

1122
01:19:07,169 --> 01:19:10,009
You... You know...

1123
01:19:10,049 --> 01:19:12,448
Look, there he is.
I told you.

1124
01:19:12,528 --> 01:19:15,088
I told you he was
right around the corner.

1125
01:19:15,168 --> 01:19:17,048
Jamie. Jamie.

1126
01:19:18,448 --> 01:19:22,008
Jamie, look behind you.
Look behind you.

1127
01:19:22,048 --> 01:19:24,568
Turn around.
Behind you.

1128
01:19:24,608 --> 01:19:28,048
All the time!
Behind you!

1129
01:19:28,128 --> 01:19:30,328
Behind you, Jamie.

1130
01:19:30,368 --> 01:19:35,127
Jamie, turn around.
Ohh! God! Yeah.

1131
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:37,847
Help me! Help!

1132
01:19:48,967 --> 01:19:52,167
- Let me in!

1133
01:19:52,247 --> 01:19:55,806
- The killer's coming after me!
He's in the house!
- Where? Wait.

1134
01:19:55,886 --> 01:19:59,246
- There's a camera in the house. Look.
- Behind you!

1135
01:19:59,326 --> 01:20:01,086
- Oh, my God. No.
- Oh, shit.

1136
01:20:01,166 --> 01:20:03,286
Jamie. Jamie.

1137
01:20:03,326 --> 01:20:05,886
- Behind you, kid!
- Randy!

1138
01:20:05,966 --> 01:20:08,606
- Behind ya!
- Look around!

1139
01:20:10,406 --> 01:20:12,726
- Shit.
- What?

1140
01:20:12,766 --> 01:20:15,165
- We're on 30-second delay.
- Oh, my God.

1141
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:18,325
Aaaah!

1142
01:20:22,205 --> 01:20:24,365
The... door.

1143
01:20:28,125 --> 01:20:30,805
Aaah!

1144
01:21:06,203 --> 01:21:09,603
- Is there a phone in the van?
- Yeah.

1145
01:21:09,683 --> 01:21:13,043
Lock yourself in it.
Call the sheriff for backup.

1146
01:21:14,523 --> 01:21:16,363
Be careful!

1147
01:21:28,962 --> 01:21:32,682
- Neil?

1148
01:21:36,122 --> 01:21:37,961
Mr. Prescott?

1149
01:21:40,001 --> 01:21:41,841
Shit!

1150
01:21:49,561 --> 01:21:52,441
Oh!

1151
01:21:57,601 --> 01:21:59,880
Kenny, I need the cellular!

1152
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:03,880
Kenny!

1153
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:08,760
- Kenny!
- Kenny! Kenny!

1154
01:22:28,239 --> 01:22:31,719
- 9-1-1.

1155
01:22:31,799 --> 01:22:34,519
- What's going on?
- Ooh! Aah!

1156
01:22:34,599 --> 01:22:36,839
Aaaah!

1157
01:22:46,238 --> 01:22:48,118
Oh, God!

1158
01:22:57,078 --> 01:22:59,398
Oh!

1159
01:23:03,717 --> 01:23:06,917
Oh, God, Kenny, I'm sorry,
but get off my fucking windshield!

1160
01:23:11,797 --> 01:23:13,837
- Stop!

1161
01:23:21,636 --> 01:23:23,476
Oh, God!

1162
01:23:30,396 --> 01:23:33,236
Dewey!

1163
01:23:33,316 --> 01:23:35,156
Dewey!

1164
01:23:35,236 --> 01:23:38,916
- Dewey, where are you?

1165
01:23:38,996 --> 01:23:40,836
Dewey!

1166
01:23:41,876 --> 01:23:43,435
Sidney?

1167
01:23:48,275 --> 01:23:50,195
Dewey!

1168
01:24:16,634 --> 01:24:18,034
Shit!

1169
01:24:43,153 --> 01:24:46,712
7825, suspect at 105 North Avenue 52.

1170
01:24:46,792 --> 01:24:49,832
Hello. Help me, please. I'm at
Stu Marker's house on Turner Lane.

1171
01:24:49,912 --> 01:24:54,112
It's 261 Turner Lane.
Please, he's going to try and kill me.

1172
01:25:15,671 --> 01:25:18,791
Sidney! Sidney!

1173
01:25:18,831 --> 01:25:21,191
Jesus, we've got to get
the fuck out of here!

1174
01:25:21,231 --> 01:25:24,471
- Stop right there!
- Don't shoot. It's me!
I found Tatum. She's dead.

1175
01:25:24,551 --> 01:25:26,430
- I think Stu did it.
- Don't listen to him, Sidney!

1176
01:25:26,510 --> 01:25:28,390
- Stay back!
- Stu did it.

1177
01:25:28,430 --> 01:25:30,910
- He killed Billy. He killed my Tatum.
- You did it!

1178
01:25:30,990 --> 01:25:33,190
- He killed my Tatum!
- No, I didn't!
- You lie!

1179
01:25:33,270 --> 01:25:35,430
Sidney, baby, please,
give me that gun!

1180
01:25:35,470 --> 01:25:37,350
Give me that gun!
Christ, man!

1181
01:25:37,430 --> 01:25:39,710
No, I didn't.
Sid, he did it!

1182
01:25:39,790 --> 01:25:43,150
He did it, Sidney! Please,
I didn't do it. He did it. Please!

1183
01:25:43,230 --> 01:25:45,630
- Please, Sidney. Oh!
- Fuck you both!

1184
01:25:45,710 --> 01:25:48,229
- Please!
- No! No! Sidney!

1185
01:25:48,309 --> 01:25:51,229
- Open up! He did it!

1186
01:25:51,309 --> 01:25:55,429
Help me! He's going crazy!

1187
01:25:55,509 --> 01:25:57,469
- Sidney! Go away!

1188
01:25:57,549 --> 01:25:59,749
Sidney?

1189
01:25:59,829 --> 01:26:03,429
Leave me alone.

1190
01:26:06,229 --> 01:26:08,348
- Sid.
- Billy.

1191
01:26:13,228 --> 01:26:17,428
Oh! Billy. Billy.
Are you okay?

1192
01:26:17,508 --> 01:26:20,228
- I'm okay.
- I thought you were dead.

1193
01:26:20,268 --> 01:26:22,948
No, I'm like a stuck pig,
but I'm all right.

1194
01:26:23,028 --> 01:26:25,028
Get up.

1195
01:26:25,108 --> 01:26:27,268
- I'm okay.
- You're bleeding.

1196
01:26:28,307 --> 01:26:30,147
- Oh, my God.
- We've gotta get help.

1197
01:26:30,227 --> 01:26:33,187
- No, he's out there!
- No, give me the gun.
Give me the gun. It's okay.

1198
01:26:33,267 --> 01:26:35,547
It's okay. It's okay.

1199
01:26:35,627 --> 01:26:37,467
Careful.

1200
01:26:38,587 --> 01:26:40,987
- Please help me!
- Come in, come in!

1201
01:26:41,067 --> 01:26:43,147
Stu's flipped out!
He's gone mad!

1202
01:26:45,507 --> 01:26:47,587
We all go a little mad sometimes.

1203
01:26:47,627 --> 01:26:49,426
- No, Billy!
- Oh, fuck!

1204
01:26:55,186 --> 01:26:58,426
Anthony Perkins, "Psycho."

1205
01:27:02,026 --> 01:27:04,226
Mmm.

1206
01:27:04,266 --> 01:27:08,706
Corn syrup. Same stuff they used
for pig's blood in "Carrie."

1207
01:27:11,785 --> 01:27:13,945
Stu.

1208
01:27:14,025 --> 01:27:17,665
Help me, please.

1209
01:27:17,745 --> 01:27:20,665
Surprise, Sidney.

1210
01:27:23,705 --> 01:27:26,265
- No!
- Ooh!

1211
01:27:26,345 --> 01:27:28,865
Oh, now. Whoa.

1212
01:27:30,505 --> 01:27:33,864
What's the matter, Sidney?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

1213
01:27:33,944 --> 01:27:36,504
Why are you doing this?

1214
01:27:36,584 --> 01:27:38,504
It's all part
of the game, Sidney.

1215
01:27:38,584 --> 01:27:41,224
- It's called "Guess How I'm Gonna Die."
- Fuck you!

1216
01:27:41,304 --> 01:27:45,704
No, no, no, no, no.
We already played that game, remember?

1217
01:27:45,784 --> 01:27:48,704
- You lost.
- It's a fun game, Sidney.

1218
01:27:48,784 --> 01:27:51,663
See, we ask you a question,
and if you get it wrong,

1219
01:27:51,743 --> 01:27:53,823
"boo-kah," you die!

1220
01:27:53,863 --> 01:27:56,823
You get it right, you die.

1221
01:27:56,903 --> 01:28:00,343
- You're crazy, both of you.
- Actually, we prefer
the term "psychotic."

1222
01:28:00,423 --> 01:28:04,343
- You'll never get away with this.
- Oh, no?

1223
01:28:05,223 --> 01:28:07,303
Tell that to Cotton Weary.

1224
01:28:07,383 --> 01:28:09,983
You wouldn't believe
how easy he was to frame.

1225
01:28:10,063 --> 01:28:13,822
Watch a few movies,
take a few notes.

1226
01:28:13,902 --> 01:28:16,182
- It was fun. - No!

1227
01:28:16,262 --> 01:28:18,422
- Whoa!
- Where're you goin'?

1228
01:28:18,502 --> 01:28:21,062
Why?

1229
01:28:21,142 --> 01:28:23,542
- Why did you kill my mother?

1230
01:28:23,622 --> 01:28:27,222
Why? Why?

1231
01:28:27,302 --> 01:28:29,822
Did you hear that, Stu?
I think she wants a motive.

1232
01:28:31,982 --> 01:28:33,821
I don't really believe
in motive, Sid.

1233
01:28:33,901 --> 01:28:35,741
- I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive?
- No.

1234
01:28:35,821 --> 01:28:39,781
Did they ever really decide
why Hannibal Lecter liked to
eat people? Don't think so!

1235
01:28:39,861 --> 01:28:43,461
See, it's a lot scarier
when there's no motive, Sid.

1236
01:28:43,541 --> 01:28:45,941
We did your mom a favor, Sid.

1237
01:28:46,021 --> 01:28:49,461
That woman was a slut-bag whore
who flashed her shit all over
town like she was Sharon Stone.

1238
01:28:49,541 --> 01:28:51,861
Yeah, we put her out of her misery,
'cause let's face it, Sidney,

1239
01:28:51,941 --> 01:28:54,940
your mother
was no Sharon Stone, hmm?

1240
01:28:59,940 --> 01:29:02,340
Is that motive enough for you?

1241
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:06,620
How about this?

1242
01:29:06,660 --> 01:29:10,980
Your slut mother
was fucking my father,

1243
01:29:12,740 --> 01:29:16,219
and she's the reason
my mom moved out and abandoned me.

1244
01:29:18,819 --> 01:29:20,739
How's that for a motive?

1245
01:29:20,779 --> 01:29:24,219
Maternal abandonment causes
serious deviant behavior.

1246
01:29:24,299 --> 01:29:26,939
It certainly fucked you up.
It made you have sex with a psychopath.

1247
01:29:26,979 --> 01:29:31,219
That's right. You gave it up.
Now you're no longer a virgin. Oooh!

1248
01:29:31,299 --> 01:29:33,179
I said "virgin." Whoops!

1249
01:29:33,259 --> 01:29:36,098
Now you gotta die.
Those are the rules.

1250
01:29:36,178 --> 01:29:40,178
Let's pretend it's all
a scary movie, Sid. How do
you think it's gonna end?

1251
01:29:43,338 --> 01:29:46,778
Oh! Oh! This is the greatest part!
You're gonna love this.

1252
01:29:46,818 --> 01:29:49,218
We got a surprise for you, Sidney.

1253
01:29:49,298 --> 01:29:52,058
Yeah, you're gonna love this one.
It's a scream, baby!

1254
01:29:52,098 --> 01:29:54,938
Hold on a sec. I'll be right back.

1255
01:29:54,978 --> 01:29:57,857
You know what time it is, Sid?

1256
01:29:57,937 --> 01:29:59,857
It's after midnight.

1257
01:29:59,937 --> 01:30:03,457
It's your mom's anniversary.
Congratulations.

1258
01:30:03,537 --> 01:30:06,297
We killed her exactly
one year ago today.

1259
01:30:06,337 --> 01:30:10,617
Attention! Oh, what do we have
behind door number three, Sidney?

1260
01:30:10,697 --> 01:30:12,377
- Daddy!
- Whoa, hold it.

1261
01:30:12,417 --> 01:30:14,137
That's enough.

1262
01:30:14,217 --> 01:30:17,336
- Guess we won't be needing this anymore.
- Uh-huh!

1263
01:30:17,376 --> 01:30:20,536
And, oh, look at this.
Ring, ring. Won't need this.

1264
01:30:20,576 --> 01:30:22,576
Got the ending
figured out yet, Sid?

1265
01:30:22,656 --> 01:30:24,616
Come on, Sidney.
You think about it now, huh?

1266
01:30:24,696 --> 01:30:27,336
Your daddy's the chief suspect.
We cloned his cellular.

1267
01:30:27,416 --> 01:30:30,656
- The evidence is all right there, baby!
- What if your father snapped?

1268
01:30:30,736 --> 01:30:33,816
Your mother's anniversary
set him off, and he went on
a murder spree, killing everyone.

1269
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:36,056
Except for Billy and me.
We were left for dead.

1270
01:30:36,096 --> 01:30:39,095
Then he... kills you...

1271
01:30:39,175 --> 01:30:41,735
and shoots himself
in the head.

1272
01:30:41,815 --> 01:30:44,535
- Perfect ending.
- I thought of that.

1273
01:30:44,575 --> 01:30:46,455
Watch this.

1274
01:30:50,295 --> 01:30:54,455
- Ready?
- Yeah. Yeah! I'm ready, baby!

1275
01:30:54,495 --> 01:30:59,094
Right! Get up!
Yeah, babe, get up! Hit it!

1276
01:31:03,734 --> 01:31:06,134
Good one, man. Jesus.

1277
01:31:06,214 --> 01:31:07,854
Oh, shit.

1278
01:31:07,934 --> 01:31:10,094
My turn.

1279
01:31:11,774 --> 01:31:15,054
Don't forget. Stay to the side
and don't go too deep.

1280
01:31:16,094 --> 01:31:18,614
Okay. I'll remember.

1281
01:31:19,613 --> 01:31:22,933
Aaah! Fuck! Fuck!

1282
01:31:22,973 --> 01:31:25,333
Fuck! Goddamn it, Stu!

1283
01:31:25,413 --> 01:31:28,333
Sorry, Billy. I guess I got
a little too zealous, huh?

1284
01:31:28,413 --> 01:31:31,293
- Give me the knife.
- No.

1285
01:31:31,373 --> 01:31:34,133
Give me the knife!

1286
01:31:36,893 --> 01:31:38,733
Now!

1287
01:31:40,932 --> 01:31:45,492
You see, Sid, everybody dies but us.
Everybody dies but us.

1288
01:31:45,532 --> 01:31:48,052
We get to carry on
and plan the sequel,

1289
01:31:48,132 --> 01:31:52,212
'cause let's face it, baby,
these days ya gotta have a sequel!

1290
01:31:54,852 --> 01:31:57,612
You sick fucks.
You've seen one too many movies.

1291
01:31:57,692 --> 01:32:00,052
Now, Sid, don't you
blame the movies.

1292
01:32:00,132 --> 01:32:03,731
Movies don't create psychos.
Movies make psychos more creative!

1293
01:32:03,771 --> 01:32:07,291
Stop it, Billy,
would you? All right?

1294
01:32:07,371 --> 01:32:10,931
I can't take any more.
I feel a little woozy here!

1295
01:32:13,571 --> 01:32:17,371
All right. All right,
you get the gun.

1296
01:32:17,451 --> 01:32:19,251
I'll untie Pops, okay?

1297
01:32:22,530 --> 01:32:25,610
- Now!
- Okay.

1298
01:32:34,330 --> 01:32:36,810
Um. Uh...

1299
01:32:36,890 --> 01:32:40,370
Houston, we...
we have a problem here.

1300
01:32:42,330 --> 01:32:44,809
- What?
- The gun, man. The gun.

1301
01:32:44,889 --> 01:32:48,329
I put it right there,
and it's not there.

1302
01:32:48,409 --> 01:32:51,529
- Where the fuck is it?
- Right here, asshole.

1303
01:32:53,049 --> 01:32:56,409
- Man, I thought she was dead.
- She looked dead, man.

1304
01:32:56,489 --> 01:32:59,129
- Still does.
- I've got an ending for you.

1305
01:32:59,209 --> 01:33:02,089
The reporter left for dead
in the news van...

1306
01:33:02,169 --> 01:33:04,128
comes to,

1307
01:33:04,208 --> 01:33:06,448
stumbles on
you two dipshits,

1308
01:33:06,488 --> 01:33:08,528
finds the gun,

1309
01:33:08,608 --> 01:33:12,208
foils your plan
and saves the day.

1310
01:33:12,248 --> 01:33:14,608
I like that ending.

1311
01:33:15,928 --> 01:33:18,008
I know something you don't.

1312
01:33:21,248 --> 01:33:23,808
Fuck. No!

1313
01:33:26,487 --> 01:33:28,687
Yeah, man.

1314
01:33:28,767 --> 01:33:32,367
Yeah. Aw, so sweet.

1315
01:33:37,287 --> 01:33:41,607
- It works better
without the safety on.

1316
01:33:46,726 --> 01:33:49,686
This is Gale Weathers signing off.

1317
01:33:49,766 --> 01:33:52,046
Babe, you're gonna love this!

1318
01:33:54,246 --> 01:33:56,086
Shit.

1319
01:33:57,686 --> 01:33:59,526
What?

1320
01:34:05,126 --> 01:34:07,445
- Where are they?
Where are they?

1321
01:34:07,525 --> 01:34:09,445
I don't know,
but I'm hurtin', man.

1322
01:34:09,525 --> 01:34:11,845
- Fuck!

1323
01:34:11,925 --> 01:34:16,165
Shall I let the machine get it?

1324
01:34:16,245 --> 01:34:18,925
- Hello?
- Are you alone in the house?

1325
01:34:18,965 --> 01:34:21,165
Bitch! You bitch!
Where the fuck are you?

1326
01:34:21,245 --> 01:34:24,045
Not so fast.
We're gonna play a little game.

1327
01:34:24,125 --> 01:34:28,804
It's called "Guess Who Just
Called The Police And Reported
Your Sorry Motherfucking Ass."

1328
01:34:28,884 --> 01:34:32,364
- Find her, you dipshit. Get up.
- I can't, Billy. You cut me too deep.

1329
01:34:32,404 --> 01:34:36,044
I think I'm dying here, man.

1330
01:34:36,124 --> 01:34:39,404
- Talk to her. Talk to her.

1331
01:34:46,004 --> 01:34:50,603
- Hello.
- Oh, Stu, Stu, Stu.
What's your motive?

1332
01:34:50,643 --> 01:34:53,603
Billy's got one. The police are on
their way. What are you gonna tell them?

1333
01:34:53,683 --> 01:34:56,003
Peer pressure.
I'm far too sensitive.

1334
01:34:56,083 --> 01:34:59,363
I'm gonna rip you up, you bitch,
just like your fucking mother!

1335
01:34:59,443 --> 01:35:02,043
- You've gotta find me first,
you pansy-assed mama's boy!
- Fuck!

1336
01:35:02,123 --> 01:35:04,843
Ow. You fuckin' hit me
with the phone, dick!

1337
01:35:04,923 --> 01:35:07,443
- Fucker, where are you?

1338
01:35:09,522 --> 01:35:12,922
- You fuck!

1339
01:35:13,002 --> 01:35:16,762
- Did you really call the police?
- You bet your sorry ass I did.

1340
01:35:16,842 --> 01:35:20,002
My mom and dad
are gonna be so mad at me.

1341
01:35:20,082 --> 01:35:23,002
Aaah! Bitch!

1342
01:35:50,680 --> 01:35:52,880
Aaah!

1343
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:58,400
Aaah!

1344
01:36:14,439 --> 01:36:17,559
Aah!

1345
01:36:17,639 --> 01:36:19,679
Ohh! My arm!

1346
01:36:26,359 --> 01:36:28,679
I always had a thing for ya, Sid!

1347
01:36:34,158 --> 01:36:37,598
- Bitch.
- In your dreams.

1348
01:37:01,117 --> 01:37:02,957
- I'm sorry. It's all right.

1349
01:37:03,037 --> 01:37:05,037
Oh, my God, Randy,
I thought you were dead.

1350
01:37:05,117 --> 01:37:07,997
I probably should be. I never thought
I'd be so happy to be a virgin.

1351
01:37:08,077 --> 01:37:10,157
- Fucker!

1352
01:37:15,596 --> 01:37:18,436
- Say hello to your mother.

1353
01:37:24,916 --> 01:37:28,116
Aaah!

1354
01:37:52,595 --> 01:37:54,435
It's okay.

1355
01:37:57,194 --> 01:37:59,954
Guess I remembered
the safety that time, you bastard.

1356
01:38:11,794 --> 01:38:13,634
Careful.

1357
01:38:13,714 --> 01:38:17,193
This is the moment when the supposedly
dead killer comes back to life...

1358
01:38:17,273 --> 01:38:19,113
for one last scare.

1359
01:38:23,273 --> 01:38:26,753
Not in my movie.

1360
01:38:30,633 --> 01:38:32,193
Dad.

1361
01:38:32,273 --> 01:38:34,713
Randy, help me out.

1362
01:38:38,312 --> 01:38:40,192
- Ow. Aah.
- Are you okay?

1363
01:38:42,512 --> 01:38:45,152
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1364
01:38:46,592 --> 01:38:50,072
- Hang in there, buddy.
- All right.

1365
01:38:50,112 --> 01:38:51,992
- Over here.
- Sorry, kid.

1366
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:55,992
Okay, I think it's going to go
something like this. Just stay with me.

1367
01:38:56,072 --> 01:38:58,911
- Hi, this is Gale Weathers...

1368
01:38:58,991 --> 01:39:03,751
with an exclusive eyewitness account
of this amazing breaking story.

1369
01:39:03,831 --> 01:39:06,151
Several more local teens
are dead...

1370
01:39:06,231 --> 01:39:09,031
bringing to an end the harrowing mystery
of the mass killing...

1371
01:39:09,111 --> 01:39:11,591
that has terrified
this peaceful community...

1372
01:39:11,671 --> 01:39:14,271
like the plot
of some scary movie.

1373
01:39:14,311 --> 01:39:16,791
It all began with
a scream over 9-1-1...

1374
01:39:16,831 --> 01:39:20,950
and ended in a bloodbath
that has rocked the town of Woodsboro,

1375
01:39:21,030 --> 01:39:23,430
all played out here
in this peaceful farmhouse...

1376
01:39:23,510 --> 01:39:25,990
far from the crimes and the sirens
of the larger cities...

1377
01:39:26,070 --> 01:39:28,070
that its residents had fled.

1378
01:39:28,150 --> 01:39:30,710
Okay, let's take it back
to one. Come on. Move it.

1379
01:39:30,790 --> 01:39:33,350
This is my big shot. Let's go.

1380
01:40:04,668 --> 01:40:08,668
Love comes down upon us
and it flows like water

1381
01:40:08,708 --> 01:40:12,708
Burning with the hope
of insight

1382
01:40:12,788 --> 01:40:16,628
There the books, the colors
of a bright elation

1383
01:40:16,708 --> 01:40:20,627
Stolen in the sight of love

1384
01:40:20,707 --> 01:40:24,667
We are, we are, we are
We're just children

1385
01:40:24,707 --> 01:40:28,667
Fighting our way
around indecision

1386
01:40:28,707 --> 01:40:32,667
We are, we are, we are
rather helpless

1387
01:40:32,707 --> 01:40:39,267
Stay kids forever
A whisper to a scream

1388
01:40:44,706 --> 01:40:48,586
Birds fly in the eye
of the faithless daughters

1389
01:40:48,666 --> 01:40:52,666
Spoken at the bitter end

1390
01:40:52,706 --> 01:40:56,666
Wasted, sacrificed
for the new nirvana

1391
01:40:56,746 --> 01:41:00,746
Nighttime sends us all above

1392
01:41:00,826 --> 01:41:04,625
We are, we are, we are
We're just children

1393
01:41:04,705 --> 01:41:08,585
Fighting our way
around indecision

1394
01:41:08,665 --> 01:41:12,665
We are, we are, we are
rather helpless

1395
01:41:12,705 --> 01:41:18,505
Stay kids forever
A whisper to a scream

1396
01:41:18,585 --> 01:41:22,864
A whisper to a scream

1397
01:41:22,904 --> 01:41:26,664
Whisper to a scream

1398
01:41:26,744 --> 01:41:32,824
A whisper to a scream

1399
01:41:40,704 --> 01:41:44,583
We are, we are, we are
We're just children

1400
01:41:44,663 --> 01:41:48,663
Fighting our way
around indecision

1401
01:41:48,743 --> 01:41:52,663
We are, we are, we are
rather helpless

1402
01:41:52,743 --> 01:41:56,823
Stay kids forever
A whisper to a scream

1403
01:41:56,903 --> 01:42:00,783
- Whisper to a scream 
- A whisper to a scream

1404
01:42:00,863 --> 01:42:04,822
- Whisper to a scream 
- Whisper to a scream

1405
01:42:04,902 --> 01:42:08,822
- Whisper to a scream 
- Whisper to a scream

1406
01:42:08,902 --> 01:42:12,822
- Whisper to a scream 
- Whisper to a scream

1407
01:42:12,902 --> 01:42:16,822
- Whisper to a scream 
- Whisper to a scream

1408
01:42:16,902 --> 01:42:20,822
- Whisper to a scream 
- Whisper to a scream

1409
01:42:20,902 --> 01:42:26,621
- Whisper to a scream 
- Whisper to a scream

1410
01:42:26,701 --> 01:42:30,341
Whisper to a scream

1411
01:44:15,096 --> 01:44:18,856
Look outside of my window

1412
01:44:20,896 --> 01:44:24,616
But all I see
is the rain come down

1413
01:44:26,096 --> 01:44:30,735
A pink umbrella
and a bit of her lace

1414
01:44:30,815 --> 01:44:35,895
Is all I need
and I'll come, come

1415
01:44:35,975 --> 01:44:39,935
I don't care
if you don't care

1416
01:44:41,215 --> 01:44:44,375
The world looks
just fine to me

1417
01:44:46,375 --> 01:44:51,374
Don't be shy
and I'll show you, baby

1418
01:44:51,414 --> 01:44:55,814
What's it like to be free

1419
01:45:02,934 --> 01:45:07,934
I don't care
if you don't care

1420
01:45:08,014 --> 01:45:11,573
The world looks
just fine to me

1421
01:45:13,213 --> 01:45:18,213
Don't be shy
and I'll show you, baby

1422
01:45:18,253 --> 01:45:23,693
What it's like to be free

1423
01:45:33,612 --> 01:45:38,692
I don't care
if you don't care

1424
01:45:38,772 --> 01:45:42,292
The world looks
just fine to me

1425
01:45:43,852 --> 01:45:48,852
Don't be shy
and I'll show you, baby

1426
01:45:48,932 --> 01:45:54,971
What it's like to be free

1427
01:46:04,611 --> 01:46:07,611
- Don't be shy 
- Told you, baby

1428
01:46:07,691 --> 01:46:10,091
Don't be shy
