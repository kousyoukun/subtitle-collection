1
00:00:19,732 --> 00:00:21,859
- Hello?
- Hello.

2
00:00:22,026 --> 00:00:24,111
- Yes?
- Who is this?

3
00:00:24,278 --> 00:00:26,948
- Who're you trying to reach?
- What number is this?

4
00:00:27,073 --> 00:00:29,043
Well, what number are
you trying to reach?

5
00:00:29,069 --> 00:00:29,892
I don't know.

6
00:00:30,034 --> 00:00:31,836
Well, I think you have
the wrong number.

7
00:00:31,862 --> 00:00:32,311
Do I?

8
00:00:32,453 --> 00:00:34,955
It happens. Take it easy.

9
00:00:43,338 --> 00:00:44,030
Hello.

10
00:00:44,056 --> 00:00:46,825
I'm sorry. I guess I dialed 
the wrong number.

11
00:00:46,967 --> 00:00:50,345
- So why'd you dial it again?
- To apologize.

12
00:00:50,512 --> 00:00:54,015
- You're forgiven. Bye now.
- Wait, wait. Don't hang up.

13
00:00:54,182 --> 00:00:56,852
- What?
- I wanna talk to you for a second.

14
00:00:56,977 --> 00:01:00,105
They've got 900 numbers for that.
See ya.

15
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:24,128
- Hello.
- Why don't you want to talk to me?

16
00:01:24,295 --> 00:01:25,054
Who is this?

17
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,115
You tell me your name,
I'll tell you mine.

18
00:01:28,257 --> 00:01:31,969
- I don't think so.
- What's that noise?

19
00:01:32,136 --> 00:01:34,263
- Popcorn.
- You're making popcorn?

20
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:37,223
- Uh-huh.
- I only eat popcorn at the movies.

21
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,697
Well, I'm getting ready
to watch a video.

22
00:01:39,723 --> 00:01:40,710
Really? What?

23
00:01:40,852 --> 00:01:44,230
- Oh, just some scary movie.
- Do you like scary movies?

24
00:01:44,397 --> 00:01:47,192
- Uh-huh.
- What's your favourite scary movie?

25
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:50,111
- Uh, I don't know.
- You have to have a favourite.

26
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:52,197
What comes to mind?

27
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:54,908
Um, "Halloween."

28
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:57,500
You know, the one with the
guy in the white mask

29
00:01:57,526 --> 00:01:59,604
who walks around and
stalks baby-sitters.

30
00:01:59,746 --> 00:02:01,664
- Yeah.
- What's yours?

31
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:06,293
- Guess.
- Um, "Nightmare on Elm Street".

32
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,022
Is that the one where the
guy had knives for fingers?

33
00:02:09,048 --> 00:02:10,280
Yeah, Freddy Krueger.

34
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:14,092
Freddy, that's right.
I liked that movie. It was scary.

35
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,762
Yeah, the first one was,
but the rest sucked.

36
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:19,306
So, you got a boyfriend?

37
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:22,142
Why? You wanna ask me out
on a date?

38
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:25,479
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?

39
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:28,357
- No.
- You never told me your name.

40
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:30,044
Why do you want to know my name?

41
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,302
'Cause I want to know
who I'm looking at.

42
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,905
What did you say?

43
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:38,241
I want to know
who I'm talking to.

44
00:02:38,407 --> 00:02:41,369
- That's not what you said.
- What do you think I said?

45
00:02:44,288 --> 00:02:46,958
What?

46
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,168
Hello?

47
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:52,964
- Look, I gotta go.
- Wait. I thought we were gonna go out.

48
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,299
Uh, nah, I don't think so.

49
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:58,636
Don't hang up on me!

50
00:03:05,725 --> 00:03:09,187
Shit. Yes?

51
00:03:09,354 --> 00:03:12,107
I told you not to hang up on me.

52
00:03:12,274 --> 00:03:14,234
- What do you want?
- To talk.

53
00:03:14,401 --> 00:03:17,154
Well, dial someone else, okay?

54
00:03:26,246 --> 00:03:28,999
- Listen, asshole--
- No, you listen, you little bitch.

55
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:33,295
You hang up on me again,
I'll cut you like a fish, understand?

56
00:03:34,796 --> 00:03:37,965
- Yeah.
- Is this some kind of joke?

57
00:03:38,132 --> 00:03:40,676
More of a game, really.

58
00:03:42,678 --> 00:03:47,683
Can you handle that, blondie?

59
00:03:58,694 --> 00:04:00,821
Can you see me?

60
00:04:02,865 --> 00:04:07,285
Listen. I am two seconds away
from calling the police.

61
00:04:07,452 --> 00:04:11,664
They'd never make it in time.
We're out in the middle of nowhere.

62
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:17,378
- What do you want?
- To see what your insides look like.

63
00:04:24,969 --> 00:04:27,388
Who's there?

64
00:04:27,555 --> 00:04:29,599
Who's there?

65
00:04:29,766 --> 00:04:32,060
I'm calling the police.

66
00:04:34,521 --> 00:04:36,658
You should never
say "Who's there?"

67
00:04:36,684 --> 00:04:39,591
Don't you watch scary movies?
It's a death wish.

68
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:41,808
You might as well
just come out here to

69
00:04:41,834 --> 00:04:44,012
investigate a strange
noise or something.

70
00:04:44,154 --> 00:04:49,409
Look, you've had your fun now, so
I think you better just leave or else.

71
00:04:49,576 --> 00:04:51,370
Or else what?

72
00:04:51,537 --> 00:04:53,833
Or else my boyfriend'll
be here any second

73
00:04:53,859 --> 00:04:55,941
and he'll be pissed
when he finds out.

74
00:04:56,083 --> 00:05:00,003
- I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.
- I lied! I do have a boyfriend...

75
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,589
and he'll be here any second,
so your ass better be gone.

76
00:05:02,756 --> 00:05:05,758
- Sure.
- I swear.

77
00:05:07,426 --> 00:05:11,889
He's big and he plays football,
and he'll kick the shit out of you!

78
00:05:12,056 --> 00:05:15,935
I'm getting scared.
I'm shaking in my boots.

79
00:05:16,102 --> 00:05:18,146
So you better just leave.

80
00:05:18,312 --> 00:05:21,816
His name wouldn't be Steve,
would it?

81
00:05:23,943 --> 00:05:26,070
How do you know his name?

82
00:05:26,237 --> 00:05:28,781
Turn on the patio lights...

83
00:05:28,948 --> 00:05:30,867
again.

84
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,670
Oh, God!

85
00:05:43,837 --> 00:05:47,090
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- Where are you? Where are you?

86
00:05:47,257 --> 00:05:49,301
- Guess.
- Please don't hurt him.

87
00:05:49,468 --> 00:05:52,512
- That all depends on you.
- Why are you doing this?

88
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:55,056
- I wanna play a game.
- No.

89
00:05:55,223 --> 00:05:57,726
- Then he dies right now.
- No! No! No!

90
00:05:57,893 --> 00:06:00,061
Which is it?

91
00:06:00,228 --> 00:06:02,647
Which is it?

92
00:06:02,814 --> 00:06:06,192
Well, what kind of a game?

93
00:06:06,358 --> 00:06:10,821
Turn off the light.
You'll see what kind of game.

94
00:06:10,988 --> 00:06:13,365
Just do it!

95
00:06:15,367 --> 00:06:18,287
No, Casey! No! No!

96
00:06:18,454 --> 00:06:20,372
No, Casey!

97
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:22,708
Here's how we play.

98
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:26,295
I ask a question.
If you get it right, Steve lives.

99
00:06:26,462 --> 00:06:29,048
- Please don't do this.
- Come on, it'll be fun.

100
00:06:29,215 --> 00:06:31,675
- Please--
- It's an easy category. - Please.

101
00:06:31,842 --> 00:06:34,680
Movie trivia. I'll even
give you a warm-up question.

102
00:06:34,706 --> 00:06:36,204
Don't do this. I can't.

103
00:06:36,346 --> 00:06:39,682
- Name the killer in "Halloween."
- No.

104
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:42,685
Come on! It's your favourite
scary movie, remember?

105
00:06:42,852 --> 00:06:45,183
He had a white mask.
He stalked the baby-sitters.

106
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:46,047
I don't know.

107
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:49,025
- Come on. Yes, you do.
- No, please.

108
00:06:49,192 --> 00:06:51,903
- What's his name?
- I-- I can't think.

109
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:55,448
Steve's counting on you.

110
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:57,992
Michael--
Michael Meyers.

111
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:00,620
Yes! Very good.

112
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,705
Now for the real question.

113
00:07:02,872 --> 00:07:05,415
- No!
- But you're doing so well.

114
00:07:05,582 --> 00:07:08,502
- We can't stop now.
- Please stop! Leave us alone!

115
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:12,422
Then answer the question.
Same category.

116
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:15,050
Oh, please stop.

117
00:07:15,217 --> 00:07:18,178
Name the killer in
"Friday the 13th."

118
00:07:18,345 --> 00:07:20,722
Jason! Jason, Jason!

119
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:24,351
I'm sorry.
That's the wrong answer.

120
00:07:24,518 --> 00:07:27,229
No, it's not!
No, it's not. It was Jason.

121
00:07:27,396 --> 00:07:29,648
Afraid not. No way.

122
00:07:29,815 --> 00:07:33,527
Listen, it was Jason!
I saw that movie 20 goddam times!

123
00:07:33,694 --> 00:07:36,737
Then you should know Jason's mother,
Mrs Voorhees, was the original killer.

124
00:07:36,904 --> 00:07:39,115
Jason didn't show up
until the sequel.

125
00:07:39,282 --> 00:07:42,201
I'm afraid that was
a wrong answer.

126
00:07:42,368 --> 00:07:46,164
- You tricked me.
- Lucky for you there's a bonus round.

127
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:50,001
But poor Steve.
I'm afraid he's out!

128
00:08:15,275 --> 00:08:18,361
Hey, we're not finished yet.

129
00:08:20,113 --> 00:08:24,451
Final question.
Are you ready?

130
00:08:24,618 --> 00:08:27,287
Please, please, leave me alone.

131
00:08:27,412 --> 00:08:29,331
Answer the question,
and I will.

132
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:34,252
What door am I at?

133
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:37,713
-What?
-There are two main doors to your house.

134
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,799
The front door
and the patio doors.

135
00:08:39,965 --> 00:08:44,136
If you answer correctly,
you live. Very simple.

136
00:08:44,303 --> 00:08:47,515
Don't do this.
I can't. I won't.

137
00:08:47,681 --> 00:08:49,809
Your call.

138
00:11:07,197 --> 00:11:09,449
Did you water
over here today?

139
00:11:09,616 --> 00:11:12,369
- It was just that water from the rain.
- They look great, don't they?

140
00:11:12,535 --> 00:11:15,372
- Don't they smell strong?
- I told you you could send it back.

141
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:21,002
Mom!

142
00:11:21,169 --> 00:11:23,338
- Jesus!
- What is it?

143
00:11:36,767 --> 00:11:38,686
Casey!

144
00:11:42,148 --> 00:11:44,442
Oh, G--

145
00:11:46,611 --> 00:11:50,406
Casey. Casey. Casey!

146
00:11:52,909 --> 00:11:55,745
- Where is she?
- Call the police!

147
00:12:00,165 --> 00:12:02,920
- Casey! Casey, are you upstairs?
- Oh, my God. Casey, baby?

148
00:12:03,086 --> 00:12:05,297
- Where is she?
- She's-- She's here.

149
00:12:05,464 --> 00:12:07,424
- Mom.
- Oh, my God, I, I can hear her.

150
00:12:07,591 --> 00:12:10,886
- Mom.
- Where is she?

151
00:12:13,055 --> 00:12:14,973
Oh, my God!
I can hear her.

152
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,059
Hey!

153
00:12:20,395 --> 00:12:24,233
Get in the car.
Drive down to the MacKenzies'.

154
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,985
- No. No, not my daughter.
- Just go.

155
00:12:27,152 --> 00:12:29,195
- Not my daughter.
- Call the police.

156
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:12,001
It's just me.

157
00:13:12,027 --> 00:13:13,765
Billy, what the-- What
are you doing here?

158
00:13:13,907 --> 00:13:16,827
- Sorry, don't hate me. - Oh, my God!
- What, do you sleep in that?

159
00:13:16,993 --> 00:13:18,236
Yes, I sleep in this.
You gotta go.

160
00:13:18,262 --> 00:13:20,021
My dad is in the other room.
You can't be in here.

161
00:13:20,163 --> 00:13:21,374
Okay, I'll just stay a sec.

162
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,359
No-- You can't be in here. Oh, no.
You gotta go. Go, go, go.

163
00:13:24,501 --> 00:13:28,546
-What's going on in there? Are you okay?
-Can you knock?

164
00:13:28,712 --> 00:13:33,509
- I heard screaming.
- No, you didn't. - No?

165
00:13:33,676 --> 00:13:36,011
Oh, well.
I'm hittin' the sack.

166
00:13:36,178 --> 00:13:38,556
My flight leaves
first thing in the morning.

167
00:13:38,722 --> 00:13:41,976
Now, the expo runs all weekend,
so I won't be back till Sunday.

168
00:13:42,143 --> 00:13:44,000
- There's cash on the
table, and I'm staying at--

169
00:13:44,026 --> 00:13:44,545
- The Hilton.

170
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:47,356
- Out at the airport, so call if--
- If I need anything. Yeah, I got it.

171
00:13:47,523 --> 00:13:49,442
I could've sworn
I heard screaming.

172
00:13:52,236 --> 00:13:55,239
- Have a good trip, okay?
- Sleep tight, sweetie.

173
00:14:00,285 --> 00:14:04,664
- Oh, close call.
- Billy, what're you doing here?

174
00:14:04,831 --> 00:14:08,092
Well, it occurred to me that I've never
snuck through your bedroom window.

175
00:14:08,118 --> 00:14:08,943
Shh, shh, shh.

176
00:14:09,085 --> 00:14:11,379
Great idea. Now that
it's out of your system.

177
00:14:11,546 --> 00:14:14,549
You know, I was home
watching television. The, uh--

178
00:14:14,716 --> 00:14:19,304
"The Exorcist" was on.
It got me thinking of you.

179
00:14:19,471 --> 00:14:22,599
- It did?
- Yeah, it was edited for TV.

180
00:14:22,766 --> 00:14:27,269
You know, all the good stuff was cut
out. And it got me thinking of us...

181
00:14:29,146 --> 00:14:32,775
how two years ago
we started off hot and heavy.

182
00:14:32,941 --> 00:14:36,069
Nice solid R-rating
on our way to an NC-17.

183
00:14:37,654 --> 00:14:41,033
And now
things have changed and...

184
00:14:46,622 --> 00:14:50,375
lately we're just sort of
edited for television.

185
00:14:50,542 --> 00:14:53,950
Oh, so you thought you
would climb in my window

186
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,531
and we'd have a
little raw footage?

187
00:14:56,672 --> 00:15:01,928
No. No, I wouldn't dream
of breaking your underwear rule.

188
00:15:02,095 --> 00:15:06,474
I just thought maybe we could do
a little on-top-of-the-clothes stuff.

189
00:15:09,727 --> 00:15:14,107
- Okay.
- Yeah?

190
00:15:14,273 --> 00:15:19,403
- Yeah.
- If we ever fly away

191
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:23,866
Baby, I'm with you

192
00:15:24,033 --> 00:15:28,787
Baby, I'm your man

193
00:15:28,954 --> 00:15:30,872
Hey.

194
00:15:46,054 --> 00:15:50,308
Okay. Okay, okay.
Time is up, stud-bucket.

195
00:15:50,475 --> 00:15:53,979
God, you see what
you do to me?

196
00:15:54,146 --> 00:15:57,022
You know what
my dad'll do to you?

197
00:15:57,189 --> 00:16:00,484
Yeah. I'm going.

198
00:16:00,651 --> 00:16:02,570
Okay.

199
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:07,491
Romeo and Juliet

200
00:16:07,658 --> 00:16:10,411
Are together in eternity

201
00:16:10,578 --> 00:16:13,080
You know, I-- I appreciate
the romantic gesture.

202
00:16:13,247 --> 00:16:15,750
So, come on, baby

203
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:19,503
Hey, about the, uh--
the sex stuff...

204
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,214
I-I'm not trying
to rush you at all.

205
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:26,718
- I was only half serious.
- Okay.

206
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:30,013
Baby, I'm your man

207
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:35,643
Baby, I'm your man

208
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,812
Hey, Billy.

209
00:16:37,979 --> 00:16:41,691
Would you settle for
a PG-13 relationship?

210
00:16:41,858 --> 00:16:43,777
What's that?

211
00:16:49,491 --> 00:16:53,286
My God.
You're just a tease.

212
00:17:00,876 --> 00:17:03,378
Thirty-five--

213
00:17:03,545 --> 00:17:06,131
Situation under control.

214
00:17:06,298 --> 00:17:09,593
Roger, dispatch.

215
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,097
There's blood found?
All right.

216
00:17:27,276 --> 00:17:30,238
They are doing drugs that
they buy in the classrooms...

217
00:17:30,405 --> 00:17:32,407
and that they are
involved in the occult.

218
00:17:32,573 --> 00:17:34,492
Occult?

219
00:17:35,827 --> 00:17:38,342
Woodsboro, California, was
devastated last night

220
00:17:38,368 --> 00:17:41,190
when two young teenagers were
found brutally murdered.

221
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:44,627
Authorities have yet to issue
a statement, but our sources tell us...

222
00:17:44,794 --> 00:17:47,255
that no arrest has been made
and the murderer could strike again.

223
00:17:47,422 --> 00:17:50,341
- Do you believe this shit?
- Damn! What is going on?

224
00:17:50,508 --> 00:17:52,468
- You don't know?
- No.

225
00:17:52,635 --> 00:17:55,826
Casey Becker and Steve
Orth were killed last night.

226
00:17:55,852 --> 00:17:56,955
What? No way.

227
00:17:57,097 --> 00:18:00,100
And we're not just talking killed.
We're talking splatter-movie killed.

228
00:18:00,267 --> 00:18:02,185
Ripped open
from end to end.

229
00:18:02,352 --> 00:18:05,018
Casey Becker, she sits
next to me in English.

230
00:18:05,044 --> 00:18:06,840
Not any more. It's so sad.

231
00:18:06,982 --> 00:18:10,527
Her mom and dad, they found her hanging
from a tree, her insides on the outside.

232
00:18:10,694 --> 00:18:14,156
Oh, my God!
Do they know who did it?

233
00:18:14,322 --> 00:18:17,492
Fucking clueless. I mean, they're
interrogating the entire school.

234
00:18:17,659 --> 00:18:20,078
- Teachers, students, janitors.
- They think it's school-related?

235
00:18:20,245 --> 00:18:20,962
They don't know.

236
00:18:20,988 --> 00:18:23,857
I mean, Dewey was saying this is the
worst crime they've seen in years.

237
00:18:23,999 --> 00:18:26,125
Even worse than--

238
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:28,836
Well, it's bad.

239
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,137
- Here you go, Mrs Tate.
- Thank you, James.

240
00:18:40,431 --> 00:18:44,894
Sidney. It would appear
to be your turn.

241
00:18:48,773 --> 00:18:52,234
- Who's up next?
- Uh, Sidney Prescott. - Prescott.

242
00:18:52,401 --> 00:18:55,071
She was daughter of, uh--

243
00:18:56,488 --> 00:18:58,990
- Sidney, how you feelin'?
- Fine.

244
00:18:59,157 --> 00:19:02,952
- Hi, Sidney.
- Sheriff Burke, Dewey.

245
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:07,373
Uh, that's Deputy Riley
today, Sid.

246
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,210
- How is everything?
- Good.

247
00:19:10,335 --> 00:19:12,337
And your dad?
How's he doin'?

248
00:19:12,504 --> 00:19:13,729
We're fine. Thanks.

249
00:19:13,755 --> 00:19:16,783
We're gonna keep this
very brief, Sidney.

250
00:19:16,925 --> 00:19:19,531
- The police just want to
ask you a few questions.

251
00:19:19,557 --> 00:19:20,578
You okay? - Mm-hmm.

252
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,807
Sidney, were you very
close to Casey Becker?

253
00:19:23,973 --> 00:19:27,476
Remember, your principal loves you,
and I want you to be safe.

254
00:19:27,643 --> 00:19:29,986
All students are encouraged
to return to their homes

255
00:19:30,012 --> 00:19:32,089
promptly from school grounds.
Avoid strangers.

256
00:19:32,231 --> 00:19:33,648
Walk in twos and threes.
Counsellors will be here tomorrow.

257
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:34,925
What kind of questions
did they ask you, Sidney?

258
00:19:35,067 --> 00:19:36,435
Thank you.
- They asked if I knew Casey.

259
00:19:36,461 --> 00:19:37,594
Yeah, they asked me that too.

260
00:19:37,736 --> 00:19:40,072
- Hey, did they ask if you like to hunt?
- Yeah, they did.

261
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:41,165
Did they ask you?

262
00:19:41,191 --> 00:19:44,184
Hunt? Why would they ask
you if you like to hunt?

263
00:19:44,326 --> 00:19:46,912
'Cause their bodies
were gutted.

264
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:49,957
- Thank you, Randy.
- They didn't ask me if I like to hunt.

265
00:19:50,124 --> 00:19:52,212
It's 'cause there's no way
a girl could've killed 'em.

266
00:19:52,238 --> 00:19:53,110
That is so sexist.

267
00:19:53,252 --> 00:19:55,796
The killer could easily be female.
"Basic Instinct."

268
00:19:55,963 --> 00:19:58,214
That was an ice pick.
Not exactly the same thing.

269
00:19:58,381 --> 00:20:00,800
Yeah, Casey and Steve
were completely hollowed out.

270
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:03,803
And the fact is, it takes a man
to do something like that.

271
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:07,974
- Or a man's mentality.
- How do you gut someone?

272
00:20:11,436 --> 00:20:16,774
You take a knife, and you slit 'em
from the groin to sternum.

273
00:20:16,941 --> 00:20:20,111
Hey, it's called tact,
you fuck rag.

274
00:20:20,278 --> 00:20:23,114
Hey, Stu, didn't you
used to date Casey?

275
00:20:23,281 --> 00:20:26,825
- Yeah, for like two seconds.
- Before she dumped you for Steve.

276
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,286
- I thought you dumped her for me.
- I did. He's full of shit.

277
00:20:29,453 --> 00:20:31,913
And are the police aware
that you dated the victim?

278
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,624
Hey, what're you saying?
That-- That-- That I killed her?

279
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:37,432
- It would certainly improve
your high school "Q."

280
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,321
- Stu was with me
last night, okay?

281
00:20:39,463 --> 00:20:40,414
Yeah, I was.

282
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,242
Was that before or after
he sliced and diced?

283
00:20:44,384 --> 00:20:46,621
Fuck you, nut case. Where
were you last night?

284
00:20:46,647 --> 00:20:47,788
Working, thank you.

285
00:20:47,929 --> 00:20:53,268
- Oh, at the video store? I thought
they fired your sorry ass. - Twice.

286
00:20:53,435 --> 00:20:57,021
- I didn't kill anybody.
- Nobody said you did.

287
00:20:57,188 --> 00:21:03,110
Thanks, buddy. Besides, it takes a man
to do something like that.

288
00:21:03,277 --> 00:21:05,285
I'm gonna gut your
ass in a second, kid.

289
00:21:05,311 --> 00:21:08,641
Tell me something. Did you really
put her liver in the mailbox?

290
00:21:08,741 --> 00:21:10,808
'Cause I heard that they
found her liver in the

291
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:12,770
mailbox next to her
spleen and her pancreas.

292
00:21:12,912 --> 00:21:15,414
Randy, you goon! Fuck!
I'm trying to eat here. Okay?

293
00:21:15,581 --> 00:21:19,043
She's getting mad, all right?
You better "liver" alone.

294
00:21:21,921 --> 00:21:24,840
"Liver" alone!

295
00:21:27,675 --> 00:21:31,096
"Liv--" Ow! "Liver. Liver. Liv--"
It was a joke.

296
00:21:36,851 --> 00:21:39,854
See you, Sidney.
I'll talk to you tomorrow, Sid.

297
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:07,005
So, you sure I can stay over, 'cause
my dad won't be back till Sunday.

298
00:22:07,172 --> 00:22:10,759
No problem.
I'll pick you up after practise.

299
00:22:10,926 --> 00:22:12,845
You okay?

300
00:22:13,011 --> 00:22:16,348
Uh-huh. It's just, you know,
the police and reporters...

301
00:22:16,515 --> 00:22:19,101
and everything,
it's like deja vu all over again.

302
00:22:19,268 --> 00:22:21,603
I'll be there by 7:00,
I promise.

303
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:23,689
- Thanks, Tatum.
- Later.

304
00:23:12,027 --> 00:23:13,863
The bodies of 17-year-old
Casey Becker and

305
00:23:13,889 --> 00:23:15,639
her 18-year-old boyfriend
Steven Orth...

306
00:23:15,781 --> 00:23:17,699
were discovered late last night
by the girl's parents--

307
00:23:17,866 --> 00:23:19,786
The Woodsboro
double murder case.

308
00:23:19,812 --> 00:23:23,313
Authorities are baffled by the
lack of clues and the savage--

309
00:23:23,455 --> 00:23:26,415
The town's in shock, and no one can
quite believe what has happened here...

310
00:23:26,582 --> 00:23:29,251
although this is not the first
time this small community...

311
00:23:29,376 --> 00:23:31,712
of Woodsboro has endured
such tragedy.

312
00:23:31,879 --> 00:23:34,340
Only a year ago Maureen Prescott,
wife and mother...

313
00:23:34,507 --> 00:23:38,886
was found raped and murdered not far
from this peaceful town square.

314
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:50,489
Hello?

315
00:24:50,515 --> 00:24:53,317
Practise ran late.
I'm on my way, okay?

316
00:24:55,586 --> 00:24:56,395
It's past 7:00.

317
00:24:56,421 --> 00:24:59,655
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't
bite it till way after 10:00.

318
00:24:59,797 --> 00:25:03,050
Oh. Oh, that's comforting.

319
00:25:03,217 --> 00:25:04,753
I'm gonna swing by
the video store.

320
00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:06,996
I was thinkin' Tom Cruise
in "All The Right Moves."

321
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:09,807
You know, if you pause it just right,
you can see his penis.

322
00:25:09,932 --> 00:25:12,977
- Whatever. Just hurry, okay?
- Ta-ta, Sid.

323
00:25:23,905 --> 00:25:27,991
- Tatum, just get in the car--
- Hello, Sidney.

324
00:25:28,158 --> 00:25:31,828
Uh, hi, who is this?

325
00:25:31,995 --> 00:25:33,914
You tell me.

326
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:40,087
- Well, l-l have no idea.
- Scary night, isn't it?

327
00:25:40,253 --> 00:25:42,058
With the murders and all,

328
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:45,909
it's like right out of a
horror movie or something.

329
00:25:46,051 --> 00:25:47,400
Randy, you gave yourself away.

330
00:25:47,426 --> 00:25:50,122
Are you calling from work,
'cause Tatum's on her way over.

331
00:25:50,263 --> 00:25:53,392
Do you like scary movies,
Sidney?

332
00:25:53,558 --> 00:25:56,727
I like that thing you're doing
with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.

333
00:25:56,894 --> 00:25:59,480
What's your favourite
scary movie?

334
00:25:59,647 --> 00:26:02,098
Oh, come on. You know I
don't watch that shit.

335
00:26:02,124 --> 00:26:03,426
Why not? Too scared?

336
00:26:03,567 --> 00:26:06,278
No, no. It's just, what's the point?
They're all the same.

337
00:26:06,445 --> 00:26:09,323
Some stupid killer stalking
some big-breasted girl who can't act...

338
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:11,826
who's always running up the stairs when
she should be going out the front door.

339
00:26:11,992 --> 00:26:16,414
- It's insulting.
- Are you alone in the house?

340
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:19,291
Randy, that's so unoriginal.
I'm disappointed in you.

341
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:22,503
Maybe that's because
I'm not Randy.

342
00:26:30,468 --> 00:26:33,722
- So, who are you?
- The question isn't "Who am I?"

343
00:26:33,888 --> 00:26:37,142
The question is
"Where am I?"

344
00:26:38,643 --> 00:26:41,229
S-S-So, where are you?

345
00:26:41,396 --> 00:26:43,732
Your front porch.

346
00:26:47,777 --> 00:26:50,196
Why would you be calling
from my front porch?

347
00:26:50,363 --> 00:26:52,824
That's the original part.

348
00:26:54,492 --> 00:26:56,494
Oh, yeah?

349
00:26:59,788 --> 00:27:03,083
Well, I call your bluff.

350
00:27:14,344 --> 00:27:17,598
- So, where are you?
- Right here.

351
00:27:50,171 --> 00:27:54,467
- Can you see me right now?
- Uh-huh. - Uh-huh. Okay.

352
00:27:54,634 --> 00:27:57,469
What am I doin'? Huh?

353
00:27:57,636 --> 00:28:00,806
Huh? What am I doin'?
Hello!

354
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:06,269
Nice try, Randy. Tell Tatum
to hurry up, okay? Bye now.

355
00:28:06,436 --> 00:28:09,106
If you hang up on me,
you'll die just like your mother!

356
00:28:10,857 --> 00:28:15,904
Do you wanna die, Sidney?
Your mother sure didn't.

357
00:28:17,155 --> 00:28:20,409
Fuck you, you cretin!

358
00:28:48,853 --> 00:28:51,230
No!

359
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,135
Shit!

360
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:38,442
Billy!

361
00:29:38,468 --> 00:29:41,136
The door's locked. I heard screaming.
You all right?

362
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:43,989
The killer's here. He's in the house.
No, he's in the house.

363
00:29:44,156 --> 00:29:46,075
He's got a knife.
He's gonna kill us.

364
00:29:46,241 --> 00:29:50,746
He's gone. He's gone.
It's all right.

365
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:03,925
What?

366
00:30:06,677 --> 00:30:08,596
Sid, what?

367
00:30:10,223 --> 00:30:12,425
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.
Wait, Sidney, wait!

368
00:30:12,451 --> 00:30:14,252
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

369
00:30:14,394 --> 00:30:17,063
What's going on?
Sidney, come back!

370
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,315
Sidney!

371
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:27,739
Sorry! I found this.
Come on!

372
00:30:27,906 --> 00:30:29,267
All right, hold
your hands together.

373
00:30:29,293 --> 00:30:31,351
Do you wish to give up
your right to remain silent?

374
00:30:31,493 --> 00:30:32,258
I didn't do anything.

375
00:30:32,284 --> 00:30:34,688
Do you wish to give up your
right to speak to an attorney...

376
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,748
and have them present
during questioning?

377
00:30:36,915 --> 00:30:39,501
Ask her. She'll tell you.
Ask her.

378
00:30:39,668 --> 00:30:40,694
What do you got, Dewey?

379
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,904
I caught him, Sheriff.
- Wait, who is that?

380
00:30:43,046 --> 00:30:46,091
- Billy Loomis.
- Sheriff, Sheriff, call these guys off.

381
00:30:46,258 --> 00:30:48,844
- I didn't do it.
- Let's go.

382
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:51,680
Sheriff, wait!
Wait, listen. Call my dad.

383
00:30:51,805 --> 00:30:54,391
Please, call him.
He'll tell you. Just call him.

384
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:57,518
Sidney! Sidney!

385
00:30:57,685 --> 00:31:00,479
- How's she doing?
- Sid's tougher than she looks.

386
00:31:00,646 --> 00:31:03,816
She'd have to be, all the
shit she's been through.

387
00:31:03,842 --> 00:31:04,633
Sid!

388
00:31:04,775 --> 00:31:07,611
Well, we're seein'
a lot of you today.

389
00:31:07,778 --> 00:31:10,740
You gonna be able to come down to the
station and answer a few questions, Sid?

390
00:31:10,906 --> 00:31:14,201
Oh, shit, Sidney! God, Sid, I'm so sorry
I was late. Are you all right?

391
00:31:14,368 --> 00:31:17,621
- Tatum, you can't be here. This is
an official crime scene. - It's okay.

392
00:31:17,788 --> 00:31:20,708
Her dad's out of town, all right?
She's staying with us tonight.

393
00:31:20,875 --> 00:31:23,252
- Does Mom know?
- Yes, doofus.

394
00:31:23,419 --> 00:31:26,213
- Let's get you out of here.
- She'll be okay. - Thanks.

395
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,758
- Come on, Sid.
- Oh, you won't believe this.

396
00:31:32,719 --> 00:31:35,388
Creepy, huh?

397
00:31:43,313 --> 00:31:46,066
- I'll be damned. - What?
- Jesus! The camera, hurry!

398
00:31:46,232 --> 00:31:48,568
My name isn't Jesus.

399
00:31:50,361 --> 00:31:53,740
Sidney, is that you in there? Excuse me.
Is that Sidney Prescott they took away?

400
00:31:53,907 --> 00:31:55,825
- I'm not talking to you.
- What happened to her?

401
00:31:55,992 --> 00:31:57,271
None of your damn business.

402
00:31:57,297 --> 00:31:59,853
I heard something about a costume.
Is that true?

403
00:31:59,995 --> 00:32:03,665
- Can you tell me anything?
- Yeah, you're a real pain in the ass.

404
00:32:03,832 --> 00:32:06,043
Leave Sid alone.

405
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:09,004
Where's she goin'?

406
00:32:09,171 --> 00:32:11,840
- Look. Kenny?
- Yeah?

407
00:32:11,965 --> 00:32:15,928
I know that you're about 50 pounds
overweight, but when I say "hurry"...

408
00:32:16,095 --> 00:32:21,183
please interpret that as
"move your fat, tub-of-lard ass now!"

409
00:32:24,645 --> 00:32:28,815
- Did you find him?
- Are you sure it was the Hilton?

410
00:32:28,981 --> 00:32:33,569
- At the airport.
- He's not registered there.

411
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:38,116
Could he have stayed
somewhere else?

412
00:32:38,282 --> 00:32:41,160
I don't know. I guess.

413
00:32:42,829 --> 00:32:46,958
- Don't worry, Sid. We'll find him.
- Dewey, they got that mask in.

414
00:32:48,251 --> 00:32:51,129
- Roger, dispatch.
- I'll be right back.

415
00:32:55,216 --> 00:32:58,009
Hold on a minute.

416
00:32:58,427 --> 00:33:03,098
Let me ask you this. What're you
doin' with a cellular telephone, son?

417
00:33:03,265 --> 00:33:05,934
Everybody's got one, Sheriff.

418
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:07,497
I didn't make those
calls, I swear.

419
00:33:07,523 --> 00:33:09,880
Why don't you check the phone
bill, for Christ's sake!

420
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:13,813
Call Vital Phone Comp. They got the
records of every number dialled.

421
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:15,927
Thanks, Hank.
We're on top of it.

422
00:33:16,069 --> 00:33:18,872
What were you doing over
at Sidney's house tonight?

423
00:33:18,898 --> 00:33:20,891
I wanted to see
her, that's all.

424
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:24,703
And last night? Sidney said you crawled
through her window last night too.

425
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:27,872
You went out last night?

426
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:31,333
I was watchin' TV. I got bored.
I decided to go for a ride.

427
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,586
Did you happen to ride by
Casey Becker's house?

428
00:33:33,753 --> 00:33:38,716
No. No, I didn't.
Sheriff, I didn't kill anybody!

429
00:33:44,138 --> 00:33:47,141
We're gonna have to hold you, son,
till we get those phone records.

430
00:33:50,686 --> 00:33:53,272
This is crazy.

431
00:33:53,439 --> 00:33:56,692
You know that?
I didn't do it.

432
00:34:07,494 --> 00:34:09,621
- Camera Two?
- Go. I do. - Okay.

433
00:34:09,788 --> 00:34:12,123
Are there any more
doughnuts in there?

434
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:14,459
- Move it, Kenny.
- They're not lettin' anybody in.

435
00:34:14,626 --> 00:34:17,587
- I'm not just anyone.
- Bitch goddess.

436
00:34:17,754 --> 00:34:18,975
Kenny, are we on? - Yeah, go.

437
00:34:19,001 --> 00:34:21,991
Hi, Gale Weathers reporting live
from Woodsboro police station...

438
00:34:22,133 --> 00:34:22,960
- Hey, where's she going?

439
00:34:22,986 --> 00:34:24,577
where we hope to get a
glimpse of Sidney Prescott.

440
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,254
- Hey, watch it, lady.
- Hey, watch the hand!

441
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,247
Do you know who you're dealing with?
- No cameras, please.

442
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:31,225
Tell 'em.
Come on, Dad. Tell 'em!

443
00:34:31,392 --> 00:34:33,519
- He's waiting for the lawyer, Billy.
- Sidney!

444
00:34:33,685 --> 00:34:35,896
- Sidney, come on. You know me.
- All right, come on.

445
00:34:36,063 --> 00:34:38,774
- Sidney, look at me!
- Don't give us any trouble.

446
00:34:38,941 --> 00:34:40,984
Come on!

447
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:49,201
Sid, we're gonna get you out of here,
okay? Are you okay?

448
00:34:51,578 --> 00:34:54,873
They sell this costume
at every five-and-dime in the state.

449
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,251
There's no way
to track the purchase.

450
00:34:58,418 --> 00:35:02,171
- What about that cellular phone bill?
- Well, we're pulling Loomis's account.

451
00:35:02,338 --> 00:35:04,424
We won't know anything
until the morning.

452
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:07,301
Oh, come on!

453
00:35:07,468 --> 00:35:08,603
- You think he did it?

454
00:35:08,629 --> 00:35:11,414
- Twenty years ago, I would've
said, "Not a chance."

455
00:35:11,556 --> 00:35:15,977
But these kids today,
damned if I know.

456
00:35:16,144 --> 00:35:19,272
- Hey, Dewey, can we go now?
- Hold on a second.

457
00:35:19,439 --> 00:35:21,649
Goddamn it, Dewey!

458
00:35:21,816 --> 00:35:23,866
What did Mama tell you?
When I wear this badge,

459
00:35:23,892 --> 00:35:25,428
you treat me like
a man of the law!

460
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:30,699
- I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy, but
we're ready to go. Now, okay? - Whoa.

461
00:35:30,866 --> 00:35:35,412
Uh, take 'em out the back way.
Avoid that circus out there.

462
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:37,873
- Come on.
- Don't touch me!

463
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,293
- He's my superior.
- The janitor is your superior.

464
00:35:44,087 --> 00:35:45,672
Let's get back to work!

465
00:35:51,845 --> 00:35:54,533
Isn't there a back way
out of this building?

466
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:56,708
Yeah. Down that
alley, I think.

467
00:36:00,436 --> 00:36:04,482
You guys just stay here. I'm gonna get
the car. Don't move. Don't make a sound.

468
00:36:06,609 --> 00:36:09,445
There she is. Sidney!

469
00:36:09,612 --> 00:36:12,406
Hi. That was some night.
What happened? Are you all right?

470
00:36:12,573 --> 00:36:14,156
She's not answering any
questions, all right?

471
00:36:14,182 --> 00:36:14,878
Just leave us alone.

472
00:36:14,904 --> 00:36:15,935
No. No. Tatum. It's okay.

473
00:36:16,077 --> 00:36:19,705
- She's just doin' her job, right, Gale?
- Yes, that's right.

474
00:36:19,872 --> 00:36:22,958
- So, how's the book?
- Well, it'll be out later this year.

475
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:25,336
Oh, I'll look for it.

476
00:36:25,503 --> 00:36:28,963
I'll send you a copy.

477
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:33,218
- Jeez. Nice shot.
- Bitch!

478
00:36:33,385 --> 00:36:36,346
- No, I mean, camera shot.
- Where'd you learn to punch like that?

479
00:36:36,513 --> 00:36:39,265
God, I loved it.
"I'll send you a copy."

480
00:36:39,432 --> 00:36:41,684
Bam! Bitch went down.

481
00:36:41,851 --> 00:36:47,357
"I'll send you a copy." Bam!
Sid-- Superbitch! You are so cool.

482
00:36:47,524 --> 00:36:49,984
Thought you might want
some ice for that right hook.

483
00:36:50,151 --> 00:36:52,237
Thanks.

484
00:36:52,404 --> 00:36:55,573
I'll be right next door.
Try to get some sleep.

485
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,991
Yeah, yeah.

486
00:37:03,038 --> 00:37:05,999
Do you really think
Billy did it?

487
00:37:06,166 --> 00:37:09,086
He was there, Tatum.

488
00:37:09,253 --> 00:37:14,842
He was destined to have a flaw.
I knew he was too perfect.

489
00:37:15,008 --> 00:37:17,970
- Telephone, honey.
- Who is it? - It's for Sid.

490
00:37:18,137 --> 00:37:20,806
- My dad?
- I don't think so.

491
00:37:20,973 --> 00:37:23,684
- Take a message.
- No, um, I'll get it.

492
00:37:27,937 --> 00:37:30,023
How's she doin'?

493
00:37:33,151 --> 00:37:37,071
- Hello.
- Hello, Sidney.

494
00:37:37,238 --> 00:37:40,658
- No!
- Poor Billy-boyfriend.

495
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:43,520
An innocent guy doesn't
stand a chance with you.

496
00:37:43,546 --> 00:37:44,645
Leave me alone!

497
00:37:44,787 --> 00:37:47,857
Looks like you fingered
the wrong guy again.

498
00:37:47,883 --> 00:37:48,649
Dewey!

499
00:37:48,791 --> 00:37:51,544
- Who are you? - Dewey!
- Hang up, Sid. - Don't worry.

500
00:37:51,711 --> 00:37:55,548
-You'll find out soon enough. I promise.
-Dewey!

501
00:37:58,258 --> 00:38:00,218
What?

502
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:05,223
- What?
- What?

503
00:38:09,895 --> 00:38:12,189
Hello.

504
00:38:21,823 --> 00:38:25,660
Sidney Prescott, who escaped
a vicious attack last night...

505
00:38:25,827 --> 00:38:29,455
is the daughter of Maureen Prescott
who was brutally killed last year...

506
00:38:29,622 --> 00:38:32,375
when convicted murderer Cotton Weary
broke into their home...

507
00:38:32,541 --> 00:38:35,378
and savagely raped
and tortured the deceased.

508
00:38:35,544 --> 00:38:38,214
Cotton Weary is currently awaiting
appeal for the death sentence...

509
00:38:38,381 --> 00:38:41,592
handed down after the young Sidney
testified against him.

510
00:38:41,759 --> 00:38:45,346
She was the key witness in
the State's case against the--

511
00:38:47,181 --> 00:38:50,476
It's never gonna stop,
is it?

512
00:38:50,643 --> 00:38:53,104
Billy was released.

513
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:56,607
His cellular bill was clean.
He didn't make those calls.

514
00:38:56,774 --> 00:38:59,526
We're checkin' every cellular account
in the county.

515
00:38:59,693 --> 00:39:03,697
Any calls made to you or Casey Becker
are being cross-referenced.

516
00:39:03,863 --> 00:39:08,076
It's gonna take some time,
but we'll find him.

517
00:39:08,243 --> 00:39:10,912
You okay?

518
00:39:26,261 --> 00:39:28,846
Don't worry, Sid, it's school.
You'll be safe here.

519
00:39:29,012 --> 00:39:30,713
So how does it feel to be
almost brutally butchered?

520
00:39:30,739 --> 00:39:32,374
Hey! Hey, now leave her alone.
- Come on, Sid.

521
00:39:32,516 --> 00:39:34,206
People wanna know. They
have a right to know.

522
00:39:34,232 --> 00:39:35,002
Leave her alone.

523
00:39:35,144 --> 00:39:36,338
How does it feel?

524
00:39:36,364 --> 00:39:40,716
She just wants to get an education.
Turn that thing off.

525
00:39:40,858 --> 00:39:42,776
What?

526
00:39:44,194 --> 00:39:46,864
Just a sec.

527
00:39:56,415 --> 00:39:57,306
Stop right there.

528
00:39:57,332 --> 00:39:59,901
I'm not here to fight.
I just need to talk.

529
00:40:00,043 --> 00:40:02,962
- Kenny, camera, now!
- Off the record. No camera.

530
00:40:03,129 --> 00:40:05,715
- Forget it.
- Please? You owe me.

531
00:40:05,882 --> 00:40:08,259
- I owe you shit!
- You owe my mother!

532
00:40:11,095 --> 00:40:13,640
Your mother's murder was last
year's hottest court case.

533
00:40:13,666 --> 00:40:15,541
Somebody was gonna
write a book about it.

534
00:40:15,683 --> 00:40:18,694
Right. And it had to be you with all
your lies and bullshit theories.

535
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,837
What is your problem?

536
00:40:19,979 --> 00:40:22,471
You got what you wanted.
Cotton Weary's in jail.

537
00:40:22,497 --> 00:40:25,343
They're gonna gas him. A book
is not gonna change that.

538
00:40:29,196 --> 00:40:31,656
- Do you still think he's innocent?
- Your testimony put him away.

539
00:40:31,823 --> 00:40:33,909
It doesn't really matter
what I think.

540
00:40:34,076 --> 00:40:37,496
During the trial, you did all those
stories about me. You called me a liar.

541
00:40:37,662 --> 00:40:40,791
I think you falsely
identified him, yes.

542
00:40:40,957 --> 00:40:43,960
- Have you talked to Cotton?
- Many times.

543
00:40:44,127 --> 00:40:47,255
- And has his story changed?
- Not one word.

544
00:40:47,422 --> 00:40:50,008
He admits to having sex
with your mother, but that's all.

545
00:40:50,175 --> 00:40:52,552
He's lying.
She never would've touched him.

546
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:57,765
He raped her, and then he-- he butchered
her. Her blood was all over his coat.

547
00:40:57,932 --> 00:40:59,209
He was drunk that night.

548
00:40:59,235 --> 00:41:02,586
He left his coat at your house
after your mother seduced him.

549
00:41:02,728 --> 00:41:04,410
I saw him leave wearing it.

550
00:41:04,436 --> 00:41:07,550
No, you saw someone
leave wearing that coat.

551
00:41:07,692 --> 00:41:13,406
The same someone who planted it
in Cotton's car, framing him.

552
00:41:13,572 --> 00:41:17,743
No. Cotton murdered my mother.

553
00:41:19,787 --> 00:41:23,124
You're not so sure
any more, are you?

554
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:26,836
Nice welt, sweetie.
Let's go, Sid.

555
00:41:27,002 --> 00:41:29,060
The killer's still on
the loose, isn't he?

556
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:29,946
Come on, Sid.

557
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:33,842
- Those murders are related.
- I'm sorry I mangled your face.

558
00:41:34,008 --> 00:41:37,345
- Wait, Sidney, don't go!
- Just stop, all right?

559
00:41:43,393 --> 00:41:46,938
Jesus Christ!
An innocent man on death row.

560
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:49,016
A killer still on the loose.
Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.

561
00:41:49,042 --> 00:41:49,799
You wanna go live?

562
00:41:49,899 --> 00:41:52,610
No, no, no. Not so fast.
We don't have anything concrete.

563
00:41:52,777 --> 00:41:57,407
-This is huge. You can't just sit on it.
-I know! That's why we need proof.

564
00:41:57,574 --> 00:42:01,535
If I'm right about this,
I could save a man's life.

565
00:42:01,702 --> 00:42:04,955
Do you know what that
could do for my book sales?

566
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:08,542
This is a mistake.
I shouldn't be here.

567
00:42:08,709 --> 00:42:12,171
I want you to meet me right
here after class, okay, Sid?

568
00:42:12,337 --> 00:42:14,757
All right.

569
00:42:14,923 --> 00:42:18,969
Hey, I haven't seen Billy around.
Is he really pissed?

570
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:21,305
Oh, you mean after you
branded him the Candyman?

571
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:24,683
- No, his heart's broken. Ow!
- Stu!

572
00:42:32,815 --> 00:42:35,026
Why are they doing this?

573
00:42:35,193 --> 00:42:38,279
Are you kidding me?
Look at this place. It's like Christmas.

574
00:42:38,446 --> 00:42:40,823
- Stupidity leak.
- Ow. Easy.

575
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:43,576
Sidney!

576
00:42:43,743 --> 00:42:46,204
- Ow!
- Jesus! Shit!

577
00:42:46,371 --> 00:42:49,165
It's just me.

578
00:42:49,332 --> 00:42:52,168
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You still think it's me.

579
00:42:52,335 --> 00:42:54,629
No. No, l-l don't.

580
00:42:54,796 --> 00:42:58,423
- It's just somebody was there.
- Hey, Christy, wait up!

581
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:00,030
Billy, someone-- someone
tried to kill me.

582
00:43:00,056 --> 00:43:00,992
I know. I know. I know.

583
00:43:01,134 --> 00:43:05,347
The cops said I scared him away.
It wasn't me, Sid.

584
00:43:05,514 --> 00:43:08,767
I know. He called me again
last night at Tatum's house.

585
00:43:08,934 --> 00:43:13,647
You see? It couldn't have been me.
I was in jail. Remember?

586
00:43:15,732 --> 00:43:19,236
I'm so sorry.
Please understand.

587
00:43:19,403 --> 00:43:23,115
Understand what? That I have a
girlfriend who would rather accuse me...

588
00:43:23,281 --> 00:43:25,867
of being a psychopathic killer
than touch me?

589
00:43:28,077 --> 00:43:30,204
- You know that's not true.
- Then what is it?

590
00:43:30,371 --> 00:43:34,792
What is it? Billy, I was attacked
and nearly filleted last night!

591
00:43:34,959 --> 00:43:36,919
I mean between us.

592
00:43:37,086 --> 00:43:39,588
You haven't been
the same since--

593
00:43:41,298 --> 00:43:43,634
- Since your mother died.
- Is your brain leaking?

594
00:43:43,801 --> 00:43:46,512
My mom was killed. I can't believe
you're bringing this up!

595
00:43:46,679 --> 00:43:50,349
- It's been a year.
- Tomorrow! One year tomorrow.

596
00:43:50,516 --> 00:43:52,655
I know. I think it's
time you got over that.

597
00:43:52,681 --> 00:43:54,962
I mean, when my mom left
my dad, I accepted it.

598
00:43:55,104 --> 00:43:58,148
It's the way it is.
She's not comin' back.

599
00:43:58,314 --> 00:44:01,317
Your parents split up.
This is not the same thing.

600
00:44:01,484 --> 00:44:03,820
Your mom left town.
She's not lying in a coffin somewhere.

601
00:44:03,987 --> 00:44:08,658
Okay, okay, okay, I'm sorry.
It's-- It's a bad analogy.

602
00:44:08,825 --> 00:44:10,785
But it's just that...

603
00:44:10,952 --> 00:44:12,871
I want my girlfriend back.

604
00:44:16,082 --> 00:44:16,641
Sid!

605
00:44:16,667 --> 00:44:18,902
Billy, I am sorry if
my traumatized life...

606
00:44:19,044 --> 00:44:22,130
is an inconvenience to you
and your perfect existence.

607
00:44:22,297 --> 00:44:25,342
What? What are you--
Nobody said that. Sid!

608
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:31,347
- Stupid.
- You make me so sick!

609
00:44:31,513 --> 00:44:36,685
Your entire havoc-inducing, thieving,
whoring generation disgusts me!

610
00:44:36,852 --> 00:44:42,191
So, two of your fellow students
just savagely murdered...

611
00:44:42,358 --> 00:44:45,527
and this is the way that you show
your compassion and sensitivity, huh?

612
00:44:45,694 --> 00:44:49,281
Let me tell you something.
You're both expelled! Get out!

613
00:44:49,448 --> 00:44:52,284
Oh, come on, Mr Himbry!
It was just a joke.

614
00:44:52,451 --> 00:44:54,620
Yeah, that's not fair!

615
00:44:58,206 --> 00:45:00,458
You're absolutely right.
It is not fair.

616
00:45:00,625 --> 00:45:03,836
Fairness would be to rip your
insides out, hang you from a tree...

617
00:45:04,003 --> 00:45:08,132
so we can expose you for the heartless,
desensitized little shits that you are.

618
00:45:20,687 --> 00:45:22,907
She was never attacked. I
think she made it all up.

619
00:45:22,933 --> 00:45:24,298
Why would she lie about it?

620
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:27,819
For attention!
The girl has some serious issues.

621
00:45:34,032 --> 00:45:38,245
What if she did it? What if
Sidney killed Casey and Steve?

622
00:45:38,412 --> 00:45:40,330
And why would she do that?

623
00:45:40,497 --> 00:45:43,792
Maybe she had the hots for Steve and
killed them both in a jealous rage.

624
00:45:43,959 --> 00:45:46,284
What would Sidney
want with Steve?

625
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:49,364
She has her own bubble-butt
boyfriend, Billy.

626
00:45:49,506 --> 00:45:52,259
Maybe she's a slut
just like her mother.

627
00:45:52,426 --> 00:45:55,804
- You're evil.
- Please, it's a common fact.

628
00:45:55,971 --> 00:45:57,015
Her mother was a tramp.

629
00:45:57,041 --> 00:45:59,582
Cut some slack. She watched
her mom get butchered.

630
00:45:59,724 --> 00:46:01,934
Yeah, and it fucked her up royally.
Think about it.

631
00:46:02,101 --> 00:46:04,603
Her mother's death
leaves her disturbed and hostile.

632
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:08,232
In a cruel and inhumane world,
she's delusional.

633
00:46:08,399 --> 00:46:11,277
Where is God? Etcetera.
Completely suicidal.

634
00:46:11,444 --> 00:46:14,113
One day she snaps.
She wants to kill herself...

635
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:17,533
but she realizes that teen suicide
is out this year...

636
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:21,620
and homicide is a much healthier,
therapeutic expression.

637
00:46:21,787 --> 00:46:25,249
- Where do you get this shit?
- "Ricki Lake."

638
00:46:25,416 --> 00:46:27,835
You are pathetic.

639
00:46:41,097 --> 00:46:43,224
Pathetic.

640
00:46:43,391 --> 00:46:45,477
Sidney.

641
00:47:10,668 --> 00:47:13,504
Sidney.

642
00:47:18,092 --> 00:47:20,928
Is someone there?

643
00:47:59,381 --> 00:48:03,427
In what appears to be a prank, several
students were seen wearing scary masks.

644
00:48:03,593 --> 00:48:05,762
School officials
have yet to comment...

645
00:48:05,929 --> 00:48:09,558
but this is known to be
the same costume worn by the killer.

646
00:48:09,725 --> 00:48:12,348
Seventeen-year-old Casey
Becker and her boyfriend

647
00:48:12,374 --> 00:48:14,629
Steven Orth have already
lost their lives.

648
00:48:14,771 --> 00:48:19,526
Who's next? You can literally feel
the fear on this campus.

649
00:48:19,693 --> 00:48:22,946
Hi. Gale Weathers,
field correspondent, "Top Story."

650
00:48:23,113 --> 00:48:26,241
I know who you are, Miss Weathers.
How's the eye?

651
00:48:26,408 --> 00:48:28,993
It's productive.
Is there a problem on campus?

652
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,162
No, everything's under control.

653
00:48:31,328 --> 00:48:34,707
- Well, of course. You're here.
- You're not supposed to be here.

654
00:48:34,874 --> 00:48:40,129
I know. I should be in New York covering
the Sharon Stone stalker, but who knew?

655
00:48:40,296 --> 00:48:43,535
You look awfully young
to be a police officer.

656
00:48:43,561 --> 00:48:45,076
I'm 25 years old.

657
00:48:45,217 --> 00:48:47,938
You know, in a demographic
study I proved

658
00:48:47,964 --> 00:48:50,748
to be most popular
amongst males 11 to 24.

659
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:55,019
Guess I just missed you.
Of course, you don't look a day over 12.

660
00:48:55,186 --> 00:48:59,397
Except in that upper torso area.
Does the force require you to work out?

661
00:48:59,564 --> 00:49:03,151
No, ma'am.
Because of my boyish good looks...

662
00:49:03,318 --> 00:49:07,447
muscle mass has increased my acceptance
as a serious police officer.

663
00:49:07,614 --> 00:49:11,534
I need your attention now, kids. Due to
the recent events that have occurred...

664
00:49:11,701 --> 00:49:16,831
effective immediately, all classes
are suspended until further notice.

665
00:49:16,998 --> 00:49:20,377
The Woodsboro police department
has issued a citywide curfew...

666
00:49:20,543 --> 00:49:23,797
beginning at 9:00 tonight.

667
00:49:23,963 --> 00:49:26,132
Looks like we've got
a serial killer on our hands.

668
00:49:26,299 --> 00:49:28,592
Well, serial killer's
not really accurate.

669
00:49:28,759 --> 00:49:31,053
Gotta knock off a couple more
to get that title.

670
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:34,181
Well, we can hope,
can't we?

671
00:49:34,348 --> 00:49:36,600
I mean, we certainly
don't have any leads.

672
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:40,521
- Have you located Sidney's father yet?
- No, not yet.

673
00:49:40,688 --> 00:49:42,838
Well, he's not a
suspect, is he?

674
00:49:42,864 --> 00:49:45,926
We haven't ruled him
out as a possibility.

675
00:49:46,068 --> 00:49:49,488
- If you'll excuse me.
- I'm sorry. Am I keeping you?

676
00:49:49,655 --> 00:49:53,659
If I may say so,
Miss Weathers...

677
00:49:53,826 --> 00:49:56,912
you are much prettier in person.

678
00:49:57,079 --> 00:49:59,163
So you do watch the show.

679
00:50:01,124 --> 00:50:05,920
I'm 25.
I was 24 for a whole year.

680
00:50:06,087 --> 00:50:09,298
Please, call me Gale!

681
00:50:09,465 --> 00:50:11,718
It was just some sick fuck
having a laugh, Sidney.

682
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:13,886
No, it was him, Tatum.
I know it.

683
00:50:14,053 --> 00:50:18,266
Well, you're not to be alone any more.
If you pee, I pee. Is that clear?

684
00:50:18,433 --> 00:50:20,685
"Kizzo-kaskizzo is is-out."

685
00:50:20,852 --> 00:50:21,936
I don't know what you did,

686
00:50:21,962 --> 00:50:25,131
Sidney, but on behalf of the entire
student body, we all say, "Thank you!"

687
00:50:25,273 --> 00:50:27,775
- Drop it, Stu.
- No, I say...

688
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:30,318
an impromptu party tonight,
my house.

689
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:33,252
Celebrate this little siesta.
What do you say?

690
00:50:33,278 --> 00:50:34,514
Are you serious?

691
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:38,910
As long as this little vixen doesn't
invite the entire world, we'll be fine.

692
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:41,204
Intimate gathering,
intimate friends.

693
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:45,042
What do you say, Sid?
I mean, pathos could have its perks?

694
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:48,670
I will totally protect you. Yo,
I am so buff. I got you covered, girl.

695
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:52,674
- No.
- Come on, Sid. For me?

696
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:55,218
It could be fun.

697
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:59,055
- Okay. Whatever.
- Yeah? Nice.

698
00:50:59,221 --> 00:51:01,974
Cool. You guys
bring food, all right?

699
00:51:18,991 --> 00:51:21,118
Yes?

700
00:51:21,285 --> 00:51:23,204
Hello?

701
00:51:58,029 --> 00:52:01,573
- Damn little shits.
- What'd you call me? Huh?

702
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:04,493
- Not you, Fred.
- You prick.

703
00:53:05,389 --> 00:53:09,477
School's out for summer

704
00:53:12,146 --> 00:53:12,730
- School's out

705
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:14,674
- What if Cotton Weary
is telling the truth?

706
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:15,508
- With fever

707
00:53:15,534 --> 00:53:18,302
- Maybe he was having an
affair with your mom.

708
00:53:18,444 --> 00:53:21,989
- I mean, your dad was always out of
town on business. Maybe-- - School's out

709
00:53:22,156 --> 00:53:22,807
- Completely

710
00:53:22,833 --> 00:53:25,434
- Maybe your mom was just
a very unhappy woman.

711
00:53:25,575 --> 00:53:27,271
If-- If they were
having an affair,

712
00:53:27,297 --> 00:53:29,604
then how come Cotton
couldn't prove it in court?

713
00:53:30,831 --> 00:53:34,501
Well, you can't prove a rumour.
That's why it's a rumour.

714
00:53:34,668 --> 00:53:38,630
Right. Created by that little
tabloid twit Gale Weathers.

715
00:53:40,215 --> 00:53:45,595
It goes further back, Sid.
There's been talk about other men.

716
00:53:45,762 --> 00:53:48,140
And you believe it.

717
00:53:48,306 --> 00:53:50,795
Well, I mean, you
can only hear that

718
00:53:50,821 --> 00:53:53,712
Richard Gere gerbil
story so many times...

719
00:53:53,854 --> 00:53:57,022
before you have to start
believing it.

720
00:54:01,444 --> 00:54:03,404
Oh, I'm sorry.

721
00:54:06,407 --> 00:54:09,012
You know, if-if I was
wrong about Cotton Weary,

722
00:54:09,038 --> 00:54:10,936
then the killer's
still out there.

723
00:54:11,078 --> 00:54:12,023
Don't go there, Sid.

724
00:54:12,049 --> 00:54:15,357
You're starting to sound like some
Wes Carpenter flick or something.

725
00:54:15,499 --> 00:54:19,670
Don't freak yourself out, okay? We've
got a long night ahead of us. Okay?

726
00:54:21,505 --> 00:54:23,424
Let's boogie.

727
00:54:26,968 --> 00:54:29,512
- It's alive!
- Henry!

728
00:54:29,679 --> 00:54:32,599
Oh, in the name of God,
now I know--

729
00:54:32,766 --> 00:54:34,684
Excuse me, dude.

730
00:54:36,644 --> 00:54:38,646
- Watch it, jerk.
- I'm sorry.

731
00:54:42,817 --> 00:54:45,028
Dork.

732
00:54:45,195 --> 00:54:47,906
Jesus, this place
is packed tonight, man.

733
00:54:48,073 --> 00:54:50,094
We had a run in the
mass murder section.

734
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,351
Comin' to my fiesta?

735
00:54:51,493 --> 00:54:54,329
- Yeah, I'm off early. Curfew, you know.
- Cool.

736
00:54:54,495 --> 00:54:56,872
What's that werewolf movie
with E.T.'s mom in it?

737
00:54:57,039 --> 00:55:00,042
- "The Howling." Horror. Straight ahead.
- Okay, thanks.

738
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:05,964
- Oh, now that's in poor taste.
- What?

739
00:55:06,131 --> 00:55:09,218
If you were the only suspect
in a senseless bloodbath...

740
00:55:09,384 --> 00:55:11,762
would you be standing
in the horror section?

741
00:55:11,944 --> 00:55:16,240
What? It was just a misunderstanding.
He didn't do anything.

742
00:55:16,406 --> 00:55:20,494
You're such a little lapdog. He's got
"killer" printed all over his forehead.

743
00:55:20,661 --> 00:55:25,540
Okay! Really? Well, why'd the cops
let him go, smart guy?

744
00:55:25,707 --> 00:55:28,008
Because obviously they
don't watch enough movies.

745
00:55:28,034 --> 00:55:29,736
This is standard
horror movie stuff.

746
00:55:29,878 --> 00:55:31,411
"Prom Night" revisited, man.

747
00:55:31,437 --> 00:55:34,448
Yeah? Why would he wanna
kill his own girlfriend?

748
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:37,551
There's always some stupid,
bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend.

749
00:55:37,718 --> 00:55:38,410
Oh?

750
00:55:38,436 --> 00:55:41,205
That's the beauty of
it all: simplicity.

751
00:55:41,347 --> 00:55:44,933
Besides, if it gets too complicated,
you lose your target audience.

752
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:47,560
Well, what's his reason?

753
00:55:47,727 --> 00:55:50,772
Maybe Sidney
wouldn't have sex with him.

754
00:55:50,939 --> 00:55:53,149
- What, is she savin' herself for you?
- Maybe.

755
00:55:53,316 --> 00:55:57,903
Now that Billy tried to mutilate her,
do you think Sid would go out with me?

756
00:56:03,492 --> 00:56:05,786
No, I don't at all. No.

757
00:56:05,953 --> 00:56:09,289
You know who I think it is?

758
00:56:09,456 --> 00:56:11,917
You know, I think
it's her father.

759
00:56:12,084 --> 00:56:14,419
Why can't they find
her pops, man?

760
00:56:14,586 --> 00:56:17,422
Because he's probably dead.

761
00:56:17,588 --> 00:56:20,257
His body will come poppin' up
in the last reel somewhere!

762
00:56:20,424 --> 00:56:24,053
Eyes gouged out, fingers cut off,
teeth knocked out!

763
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:26,555
- See, the police are always off
track with this shit. - Man!

764
00:56:26,722 --> 00:56:28,807
If they'd watch "Prom Night,"
they'd save time.

765
00:56:28,974 --> 00:56:33,520
There's a formula to it. A very simple
formula! Everybody's a suspect!

766
00:56:39,484 --> 00:56:43,780
I'm telling you, the dad's
a red herring. It's Billy.

767
00:56:43,947 --> 00:56:48,367
How do we know you're
not the killer? Huh? Huh?

768
00:56:48,534 --> 00:56:49,393
Hi, Billy.

769
00:56:49,419 --> 00:56:52,855
Maybe your movie-freaked mind lost its 
reality button. You ever think of that?

770
00:56:52,997 --> 00:56:55,124
You're absolutely right.
I'm the first to admit it.

771
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:57,949
If this were a scary movie,
I'd be the prime suspect.

772
00:56:57,975 --> 00:56:58,860
That's right.

773
00:56:59,002 --> 00:57:01,546
And what would be
your motive?

774
00:57:01,712 --> 00:57:05,550
It's the millennium.
Motives are incidental.

775
00:57:05,717 --> 00:57:07,760
"Millennium."

776
00:57:07,927 --> 00:57:12,014
"Millennium." I like that.
That's good. It's the millennium.

777
00:57:13,181 --> 00:57:16,477
Good kid.

778
00:57:16,644 --> 00:57:19,312
"Millennium."
Good word, my man.

779
00:57:19,438 --> 00:57:21,356
Are you telling me
that's not a killer?

780
00:57:24,483 --> 00:57:26,861
You'll see him
in your nightmares

781
00:57:27,028 --> 00:57:29,697
You'll see him
in your dreams

782
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:35,536
He'll appear
out of nowhere

783
00:57:35,703 --> 00:57:37,788
But he ain't

784
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:40,957
What he seems

785
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,168
You'll see him in your head

786
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:45,419
On the TV screen

787
00:57:45,586 --> 00:57:49,090
Hey, buddy
I'm warnin' you to turn it off

788
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:51,509
Ah, he's a ghost
He's a god

789
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:55,012
He's a man
He's a guru

790
00:57:56,556 --> 00:58:01,018
You're one microscopic cog
in his catastrophic plan

791
00:58:01,185 --> 00:58:06,189
Designed and directed
by his red right hand

792
00:58:06,356 --> 00:58:09,526
Sure is quiet.

793
00:58:09,693 --> 00:58:12,737
God, look at this place.
It's "The Town That Dreaded Sundown."

794
00:58:12,904 --> 00:58:16,990
Yeah, I saw that movie.
It's about a killer in Texas, huh?

795
00:58:17,157 --> 00:58:20,619
Hey, Sid, just think. If they make a
movie about you, who's gonna play you?

796
00:58:20,786 --> 00:58:24,623
- I shudder to think.
- I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.

797
00:58:24,790 --> 00:58:28,251
Thanks, Dewey. With my luck,
they'd cast Tori Spelling.

798
00:58:28,419 --> 00:58:31,129
I'm just gonna be
a few minutes.

799
00:58:31,296 --> 00:58:34,215
You girls don't go too far.

800
00:58:35,758 --> 00:58:38,302
- Is Billy gonna be there tonight?
- He better not be.

801
00:58:38,469 --> 00:58:40,230
I told Stu to keep
his mouth shut.

802
00:58:40,256 --> 00:58:43,374
I think we can live without the
endorphin rush for one night.

803
00:58:45,601 --> 00:58:48,687
Billy's right, you know. Whenever
he touches me, I just can't relax.

804
00:58:48,853 --> 00:58:52,524
So you have a few intimacy issues as a
result of your mother's untimely death.

805
00:58:52,691 --> 00:58:54,943
It's no big deal, Sid.
I mean, you'll thaw out.

806
00:58:55,110 --> 00:58:58,321
Yeah, but he has been so patient with
me, you know, with all the sex stuff.

807
00:58:58,487 --> 00:59:02,325
How many guys would put up with
a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?

808
00:59:02,492 --> 00:59:05,703
Billy and his penis
don't deserve you, all right?

809
00:59:14,586 --> 00:59:18,589
- Dewey, where the hell you been?
- I was keepin' an eye on Sidney, uh--

810
00:59:20,216 --> 00:59:24,637
- Thought you quit.
- I did. But damn it--

811
00:59:24,804 --> 00:59:28,724
Dewey, Vital Phone
just faxed us.

812
00:59:28,891 --> 00:59:32,937
Those calls are listed
to Neil Prescott, Sidney's father.

813
00:59:33,104 --> 00:59:37,357
He made the calls with a cellular phone.
It's been confirmed.

814
00:59:37,524 --> 00:59:40,360
There's no way a cellular
could've been cloned?

815
00:59:40,526 --> 00:59:43,405
There's more.
Guess what tomorrow is.

816
00:59:43,572 --> 00:59:46,366
The anniversary
of his wife's death.

817
00:59:48,826 --> 00:59:51,495
We'll keep the roadblocks and the curfew
in effect through the night.

818
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:54,999
If he's not picked up by morning,
then we'll do a house-to-house.

819
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,258
Where's Sidney?

820
00:59:57,284 --> 01:00:00,111
She's with my sister. You
want me to bring her in?

821
01:00:00,253 --> 01:00:03,214
No. Not just yet.

822
01:00:03,381 --> 01:00:07,260
Let's find Neil first,
make sure he's our man.

823
01:00:15,685 --> 01:00:19,313
You stay close to Sidney.
Don't let her out of your sight.

824
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:22,148
Yes, sir.

825
01:00:41,667 --> 01:00:45,003
Say a prayer
for the youth of America

826
01:00:48,382 --> 01:00:51,551
God bless the youth
of America

827
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:56,890
And I can't stand
their sight any more

828
01:00:57,057 --> 01:00:59,225
All right,
you girls have fun.

829
01:00:59,392 --> 01:01:02,061
Not too much fun,
or I'll bust ya.

830
01:01:03,604 --> 01:01:06,273
- Bye.
- Bye, Sid.

831
01:01:07,525 --> 01:01:13,613
You're obsessed

832
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:18,410
You're obsessed

833
01:01:18,576 --> 01:01:20,495
Here, kids!

834
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:23,893
Oh, that's mature.

835
01:01:23,919 --> 01:01:26,942
You guys were tardy for the
party, so we started without you.

836
01:01:27,084 --> 01:01:29,378
My man!

837
01:01:48,312 --> 01:01:52,191
- Well, were we spotted?
- I don't think so. Go get the camera.

838
01:01:54,818 --> 01:01:56,736
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare ya.

839
01:01:56,903 --> 01:02:00,949
- Deputy, that's okay.
- What brings you to these parts?

840
01:02:01,116 --> 01:02:05,286
Well, you just never know
when or where a story will break.

841
01:02:05,453 --> 01:02:09,706
Not much of a story here.
Just a bunch of kids cuttin' it loose.

842
01:02:09,873 --> 01:02:12,543
Then what are you
doing here?

843
01:02:14,169 --> 01:02:16,505
Just keepin' an eye
on things.

844
01:02:16,672 --> 01:02:19,507
I'm gonna check the party out.

845
01:02:19,674 --> 01:02:24,054
- Do you mind if I join you?
- Not at all.

846
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:27,390
All right.
Let me just get my coat. Thanks.

847
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:36,231
- All right.
- Yeah, I'm fine.

848
01:02:36,398 --> 01:02:38,317
Oh! Yeah.

849
01:02:39,818 --> 01:02:42,654
- How many "Evil Deads?"
- One! - Two!

850
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:45,407
- How many "Hellraisers?"
- Hellraiser right here.

851
01:02:45,574 --> 01:02:48,534
"The Fog," "Terror Train,"
"Prom Night."

852
01:02:48,701 --> 01:02:52,037
How come Jamie Lee Curtis
is in all of these movies?

853
01:02:52,204 --> 01:02:54,624
She's the scream queen.

854
01:02:54,791 --> 01:02:57,260
With a set of lungs
like that, she should be.

855
01:02:57,286 --> 01:02:57,902
Yeah.

856
01:02:58,043 --> 01:03:01,546
- Tits. See?
- Oh, I'll get it.

857
01:03:04,132 --> 01:03:05,948
Hey, Tate, grab me
another beer, would ya?

858
01:03:05,974 --> 01:03:07,536
There's more beer
in the garage.

859
01:03:07,677 --> 01:03:11,389
- What am I, the beer wench?
- She was nominated--

860
01:03:11,556 --> 01:03:14,391
- She was nominated for "Terror Train."
- You're not gonna believe who's here!

861
01:03:14,558 --> 01:03:17,770
- It's that chick from "Top Story!"
- Gale Weathers? - Here!

862
01:03:17,937 --> 01:03:20,856
- Shit!
- You're under age, son.

863
01:03:22,524 --> 01:03:25,486
I'm kiddin'. Have a good time.
Watch the drivin'.

864
01:03:25,653 --> 01:03:27,696
- Dewey.
- Hi.

865
01:03:27,863 --> 01:03:29,865
Dewey.

866
01:03:30,031 --> 01:03:33,034
- What is she doing here?
- She's with me.

867
01:03:33,201 --> 01:03:36,162
- I'm just checkin' things out.
- So you did.

868
01:03:36,329 --> 01:03:39,749
Now leave, and take
your media mouth with you.

869
01:03:41,584 --> 01:03:44,127
- I just think you're awesome.
- Oh, thank you very much.

870
01:03:44,294 --> 01:03:46,212
- I watch your show religiously.
- That's great.

871
01:03:46,379 --> 01:03:48,674
- Hey.
- Hey.

872
01:03:48,841 --> 01:03:51,676
I need a camera.

873
01:03:51,843 --> 01:03:54,679
- Have you found my father?
- I'm afraid not.

874
01:03:56,555 --> 01:03:58,558
- Should I be worried?
- Not yet.

875
01:04:01,102 --> 01:04:04,480
- Get out, you're walkin'
- That's the one I want.

876
01:04:04,646 --> 01:04:08,025
Too bad, I've spoken

877
01:04:08,192 --> 01:04:10,694
When I look at you
you're forgiven

878
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:30,212
You're forgiven

879
01:04:49,855 --> 01:04:51,774
Jesus!

880
01:04:54,109 --> 01:04:56,695
Tatum, it's okay.

881
01:05:06,037 --> 01:05:08,414
Shit.

882
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:13,878
Hey, shitheads!

883
01:05:15,463 --> 01:05:17,381
Hello!

884
01:05:18,715 --> 01:05:21,634
Shit. Piss.

885
01:05:39,568 --> 01:05:43,029
Is that you, Randy?

886
01:05:43,196 --> 01:05:46,533
Cute. What movie is this from?
"I Spit On Your Garage?"

887
01:05:48,034 --> 01:05:51,496
Lose the outfit.
If Sidney sees it, she'll flip.

888
01:05:51,662 --> 01:05:54,499
Oh, you wanna play
psycho killer?

889
01:05:54,666 --> 01:05:57,210
Can I be
the helpless victim?

890
01:05:57,376 --> 01:06:01,130
Okay, let's see-- No, please
don't kill me, Mr Ghost Face.

891
01:06:01,296 --> 01:06:03,757
I wanna be in the sequel!

892
01:06:05,217 --> 01:06:08,387
Cut, Casper.
That's a wrap.

893
01:06:10,305 --> 01:06:12,598
Randy, what the hell
are you doing?

894
01:06:16,728 --> 01:06:18,980
Stop!

895
01:06:27,992 --> 01:06:30,536
Fucker!

896
01:07:09,961 --> 01:07:12,922
- Happy curfew.
- Nice party, Stu.

897
01:07:13,089 --> 01:07:15,925
- Tatum, come on!
- There's nobody here but us chickens!

898
01:07:16,092 --> 01:07:18,969
- Do you know where she is?
- No, I haven't seen her.

899
01:07:21,054 --> 01:07:23,557
Oh. Billy. Hey.

900
01:07:23,724 --> 01:07:26,685
Billy. Hmm.
What are you doin' here?

901
01:07:26,852 --> 01:07:29,103
I was hoping I could talk
to Sid alone.

902
01:07:29,270 --> 01:07:31,647
You know, if Tatum sees you here,
she'll draw blood.

903
01:07:31,814 --> 01:07:34,109
I tell you what. Why don't you guys
go up to my parents' room?

904
01:07:34,275 --> 01:07:39,113
You know, you guys
can talk, whatever.

905
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:42,449
Subtlety, Stu.
You should look it up.

906
01:07:42,616 --> 01:07:44,785
No, i-it's okay.
We do need to talk.

907
01:07:54,961 --> 01:07:58,840
- What's Leatherface doin' here?
- Cute. He came to make up.

908
01:07:59,006 --> 01:08:01,842
There goes my chance with Sid.
Damn it.

909
01:08:02,009 --> 01:08:04,012
As if.
That's all I'm sayin'.

910
01:08:04,178 --> 01:08:06,097
As if.

911
01:08:06,263 --> 01:08:09,016
Oh, really, Alicia?

912
01:08:09,183 --> 01:08:11,977
"As if."
I'm gonna go check on them.

913
01:08:12,143 --> 01:08:12,886
Come on!

914
01:08:12,912 --> 01:08:15,881
Okay, everyone. It was
nice to meet all of you.

915
01:08:16,023 --> 01:08:18,274
- Thank you.
- Stick around.

916
01:08:18,441 --> 01:08:20,610
You're a genius.

917
01:08:20,777 --> 01:08:23,487
- Oh, shit.
- What?

918
01:08:23,654 --> 01:08:25,782
- I got a delay.
- How long is it?

919
01:08:25,949 --> 01:08:28,951
I don't know. What'd it take you
to walk from the house, 30 seconds?

920
01:08:29,118 --> 01:08:31,119
- It'll be fine. Just record it.
- All right.

921
01:08:31,286 --> 01:08:34,456
Oh, the placement is perfect.
Tell me, Kenneth--

922
01:08:34,622 --> 01:08:37,960
Has a cheesy tabloid journalist
ever won the Pulitzer?

923
01:08:38,126 --> 01:08:42,213
- Well, first time for everything.
- You're damn right.

924
01:08:48,886 --> 01:08:50,805
S-So, um--

925
01:08:53,557 --> 01:08:55,475
So--

926
01:08:57,811 --> 01:09:00,731
Look, I'm sorry.

927
01:09:00,897 --> 01:09:05,026
I've been selfish,
and I want to apologize.

928
01:09:05,193 --> 01:09:07,988
No, Billy, I-I'm...

929
01:09:08,154 --> 01:09:11,616
the one who's been selfish
and self-absorbed...

930
01:09:11,782 --> 01:09:14,159
with all this
post-traumatic stress.

931
01:09:15,911 --> 01:09:19,456
- You lost your mom.
- Yeah, I know, but you're right.

932
01:09:19,623 --> 01:09:21,542
Enough is enough.
I--

933
01:09:21,708 --> 01:09:24,836
I can't wallow in-in
the grief process forever...

934
01:09:25,003 --> 01:09:26,921
and--

935
01:09:29,049 --> 01:09:34,637
and I can't keep lying to myself
about who my mom was.

936
01:09:38,515 --> 01:09:41,268
Yeah, I think I'm really...

937
01:09:42,853 --> 01:09:45,021
scared...

938
01:09:45,188 --> 01:09:48,441
that I'm gonna turn out
just like her, you know?

939
01:09:49,775 --> 01:09:53,196
Like "The Bad Seed"
or somethin'.

940
01:09:53,363 --> 01:09:56,198
And I know--
I know it doesn't make sense.

941
01:09:57,449 --> 01:09:59,368
Yeah, it does.

942
01:10:03,330 --> 01:10:06,666
It's like Jodie Foster in
"The Silence of the Lambs"...

943
01:10:06,833 --> 01:10:10,670
when she keeps having
flashbacks of her dead father.

944
01:10:10,837 --> 01:10:14,841
But this is life.
This isn't a movie.

945
01:10:15,008 --> 01:10:17,343
Sure it is, Sid.

946
01:10:17,510 --> 01:10:19,428
It's all--
It's all a movie.

947
01:10:19,595 --> 01:10:21,513
It's all...

948
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:23,599
one great big movie.

949
01:10:30,063 --> 01:10:32,398
Only you can't pick
your genre.

950
01:10:59,007 --> 01:11:01,425
Why can't I be
a Meg Ryan movie?

951
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:07,431
Or even a good porno.

952
01:11:11,351 --> 01:11:13,937
- What?
- You heard me.

953
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:24,905
Are you sure?

954
01:11:26,157 --> 01:11:28,201
Yeah.

955
01:11:28,368 --> 01:11:31,162
I think so.

956
01:11:46,634 --> 01:11:48,803
Look, look, look.
Here it comes.

957
01:11:50,388 --> 01:11:52,515
Oh, man.
The colour of the blood is all wrong!

958
01:11:52,681 --> 01:11:55,184
Why do they do that?
It's too red!

959
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:58,687
Wait. Here comes another.
Here it-- Here it--

960
01:11:58,854 --> 01:12:00,773
- Ooh!
- Yes! Yes!

961
01:12:00,939 --> 01:12:03,150
Predictable.
I knew he was gonna bite it.

962
01:12:03,316 --> 01:12:05,610
How can you watch this shit
over and over?

963
01:12:05,777 --> 01:12:08,321
When do we see breasts?
I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts.

964
01:12:08,488 --> 01:12:11,157
- When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
- Yes. Yes. - Breasts?

965
01:12:11,324 --> 01:12:13,618
Not until "Trading Places"
in '83.

966
01:12:13,784 --> 01:12:16,120
Jamie Lee was always the virgin
in horror movies.

967
01:12:16,286 --> 01:12:18,455
She never showed her tits
till she went legits.

968
01:12:18,623 --> 01:12:21,750
- Could afford a decent pair.
- What did you--

969
01:12:21,917 --> 01:12:23,245
That's why she always
outsmarted the

970
01:12:23,271 --> 01:12:24,778
killer in the big chase
scene at the end.

971
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:27,213
Only virgins can do that.
Don't you know the rules?

972
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:29,758
- What rules?
- You don--

973
01:12:32,135 --> 01:12:34,470
Jesus Christ.
You don't know the rules?

974
01:12:34,637 --> 01:12:36,597
Have an aneurysm,
why don't ya?

975
01:12:36,764 --> 01:12:39,349
There are certain rules
that one must abide by...

976
01:12:39,516 --> 01:12:41,936
in order to successfully
survive a horror movie.

977
01:12:42,103 --> 01:12:45,647
For instance, number one:
You can never have sex.

978
01:12:48,441 --> 01:12:51,862
- Big no-no! Big no-no!
- I'd be a dead man.

979
01:12:52,029 --> 01:12:53,947
- Sex equals death. Okay?
- Yes!

980
01:12:54,114 --> 01:12:57,033
Number two:
You can never drink or do drugs.

981
01:12:59,827 --> 01:13:01,871
No, the sin factor.

982
01:13:02,038 --> 01:13:04,290
It's a sin.
It's an extension of number one.

983
01:13:04,457 --> 01:13:07,167
And number three:
Never, ever, ever...

984
01:13:07,334 --> 01:13:10,670
under any circumstances say, "I'll be
right back," 'cause you won't be back.

985
01:13:10,837 --> 01:13:13,507
- I'm gettin' another beer. You want one?
- Yeah, sure.

986
01:13:13,674 --> 01:13:16,009
I'll be right back!

987
01:13:17,885 --> 01:13:20,137
You see? You push the laws
and you end up dead.

988
01:13:20,304 --> 01:13:22,222
Okay? I'll see you
in the kitchen with a knife.

989
01:13:22,390 --> 01:13:25,726
Only virgins can outsmart the killer
in the big chase scene at the end.

990
01:13:25,893 --> 01:13:28,270
- Don't you know the rules?
- What rules?

991
01:13:28,437 --> 01:13:30,897
You don't know the rules?
There are certain rules...

992
01:13:31,064 --> 01:13:32,607
- that one must abide
by in order to

993
01:13:32,633 --> 01:13:34,551
essentially survive a horror movie.
- Boring.

994
01:13:34,693 --> 01:13:39,739
- For instance--
- The sheriff just radioed.

995
01:13:39,906 --> 01:13:42,282
Somebody reported a car in
the bushes down the road.

996
01:13:42,308 --> 01:13:43,517
I'm gonna go check it out.

997
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:46,996
- Would you care to join me?
- I'd love to.

998
01:13:47,163 --> 01:13:49,540
If you're sure
it's all right.

999
01:13:49,707 --> 01:13:52,584
Ma'am,
I'm the deputy of this town.

1000
01:13:54,879 --> 01:13:57,089
Be right back.

1001
01:13:59,633 --> 01:14:01,759
You see, you push the laws
and you end up dead.

1002
01:14:01,926 --> 01:14:04,763
- W-- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Mm-hmm?

1003
01:14:04,930 --> 01:14:06,848
I thought maybe we'd walk.

1004
01:14:08,641 --> 01:14:11,852
It's such a nice night out.
I got a flashlight.

1005
01:14:15,063 --> 01:14:18,442
- You're not scared, are ya?
- No.

1006
01:14:18,609 --> 01:14:21,027
- All right.
- Great.

1007
01:14:25,156 --> 01:14:27,117
Do you know what
that constellation is?

1008
01:14:27,284 --> 01:14:29,327
No. What is it?

1009
01:14:29,494 --> 01:14:32,621
I don't know.
That's why I was askin' you.

1010
01:14:36,291 --> 01:14:37,303
What happened to Tatum, Stu?

1011
01:14:37,329 --> 01:14:39,028
She probably got
pissed at me and bailed.

1012
01:14:39,170 --> 01:14:41,088
- Bye.
- Bye.

1013
01:14:42,589 --> 01:14:44,758
No, I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.

1014
01:15:01,398 --> 01:15:04,317
Look! Here comes
the obligatory tit shot!

1015
01:15:08,071 --> 01:15:09,990
- Yes! Oh! That was beautiful!
- Lovely!

1016
01:15:12,075 --> 01:15:14,660
- Oh, my God.
- I'll leave you guys alone.

1017
01:15:15,828 --> 01:15:17,746
You are so...

1018
01:15:19,332 --> 01:15:21,250
amazing.

1019
01:15:27,130 --> 01:15:30,092
Hello? Yeah?

1020
01:15:34,512 --> 01:15:36,431
Holy shit.

1021
01:15:38,015 --> 01:15:41,811
N-- Ho--
Listen up.

1022
01:15:41,978 --> 01:15:44,814
They found
Principal Himbry dead.

1023
01:15:54,914 --> 01:15:57,041
We were just gettin'
to the good part.

1024
01:15:57,208 --> 01:16:00,586
Hello? Yeah?

1025
01:16:06,925 --> 01:16:10,512
Where are you guys--

1026
01:16:23,648 --> 01:16:26,735
Heigh-ho, Silver!
Let's go!

1027
01:16:26,902 --> 01:16:31,114
- So, is-- is Dewey your real name?
- No, it's Dwight.

1028
01:16:31,281 --> 01:16:32,740
Dwight?

1029
01:16:32,907 --> 01:16:35,451
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's all right.

1030
01:16:35,618 --> 01:16:39,288
Dewey's just somethin'
I got stuck with a long time ago.

1031
01:16:39,455 --> 01:16:41,374
Well, I like it.

1032
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:43,792
It's sexy.

1033
01:16:43,959 --> 01:16:46,546
- Sexy?
- Mm-hmm.

1034
01:16:46,712 --> 01:16:50,048
Ah, it's just this town's way
of not takin' me serious.

1035
01:16:50,215 --> 01:16:52,551
What about Gale Weathers?

1036
01:16:52,717 --> 01:16:55,720
Sounds like I'm
a meteorologist or something.

1037
01:16:57,180 --> 01:17:02,185
People treat me like I'm the antichrist
of television journalism.

1038
01:17:02,351 --> 01:17:04,770
- I don't think you're that bad.
- No? - No.

1039
01:17:04,937 --> 01:17:07,356
I think that's just 'cause
you kinda like me.

1040
01:17:07,522 --> 01:17:10,192
They sure are comin' fast.
Slow down!

1041
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:12,277
Freeze! Jump!

1042
01:17:16,114 --> 01:17:19,951
- I'm sorry. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1043
01:17:32,087 --> 01:17:34,423
I'm sorry.
I'm on duty.

1044
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:46,058
Is that what
you're looking for?

1045
01:17:46,225 --> 01:17:48,144
My whole life.

1046
01:17:53,065 --> 01:17:55,526
- Damn!
- What?

1047
01:17:55,692 --> 01:17:57,611
- What is it?
- This is Neil Prescott's car.

1048
01:17:57,778 --> 01:17:59,904
- Sidney's father?
- Yeah.

1049
01:18:01,490 --> 01:18:03,408
Jesus.
What's he doing here?

1050
01:18:05,118 --> 01:18:07,036
We gotta get back.

1051
01:18:10,664 --> 01:18:12,584
You okay?

1052
01:18:14,127 --> 01:18:16,045
Yeah.

1053
01:18:16,212 --> 01:18:18,130
Yeah, I'm fine.

1054
01:18:28,723 --> 01:18:32,393
- Who'd you call?
- What?

1055
01:18:32,561 --> 01:18:36,147
Well, I don't know. When you're arrested
you're allowed one phone call.

1056
01:18:36,314 --> 01:18:38,857
So I was just curious.
Who'd you call?

1057
01:18:40,943 --> 01:18:42,861
Called my dad.

1058
01:18:45,030 --> 01:18:48,533
No, um, Sheriff Burke
called your dad. I saw him.

1059
01:18:51,369 --> 01:18:54,748
Yeah, but when I called
I didn't get an answer.

1060
01:19:06,008 --> 01:19:08,969
You don't still think
it was me, do you?

1061
01:19:12,472 --> 01:19:15,267
No.

1062
01:19:15,434 --> 01:19:17,519
No. I was just thinking...

1063
01:19:17,685 --> 01:19:21,355
if it were you it'd be a very
clever way to throw me off track.

1064
01:19:21,522 --> 01:19:24,401
You know, using your one
phone call to call me

1065
01:19:24,427 --> 01:19:27,428
so that I wouldn't think
it was you, that's all.

1066
01:19:27,570 --> 01:19:29,613
Really.

1067
01:19:36,495 --> 01:19:40,957
What do I have to do to prove
to you that I'm not a killer?

1068
01:19:42,542 --> 01:19:45,127
- Oh, my God.
- Huh?

1069
01:19:46,963 --> 01:19:49,715
- Oh, my God. - Sidney--
- Billy, watch out!

1070
01:19:56,058 --> 01:19:58,268
Sid.

1071
01:20:28,885 --> 01:20:30,804
Shit!

1072
01:20:36,184 --> 01:20:38,853
Help me, somebody!
Help me!

1073
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,705
Help me!

1074
01:21:29,275 --> 01:21:34,030
No, Jamie.
Uh, watch out.

1075
01:21:34,197 --> 01:21:36,365
Watch out, Jamie.
You know he's around.

1076
01:21:36,532 --> 01:21:39,409
You-- You know--
Look--

1077
01:21:39,576 --> 01:21:41,953
Look, there he is.
I told you.

1078
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:44,706
I told you he was
right around the corner.

1079
01:21:44,873 --> 01:21:46,791
Jamie. Jamie.

1080
01:21:48,293 --> 01:21:51,921
Jamie, look behind you.
Look behind you.

1081
01:21:52,087 --> 01:21:54,590
Turn around.
Behind you.

1082
01:21:54,757 --> 01:21:59,011
All the time!
Behind you!

1083
01:21:59,178 --> 01:22:01,596
Behind you, Jamie.

1084
01:22:01,763 --> 01:22:05,601
Jamie, turn around.
Ohh! God! Yeah.

1085
01:22:05,768 --> 01:22:08,436
Help me! Help!

1086
01:22:20,531 --> 01:22:23,533
Let me in!

1087
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:25,774
The killer's coming after me!
He's in the house!

1088
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:26,519
Where? Wait.

1089
01:22:26,662 --> 01:22:30,749
- There's a camera in the house. Look.
- Behind you!

1090
01:22:30,915 --> 01:22:33,626
- Oh, my God. No.
- Oh, shit.

1091
01:22:33,793 --> 01:22:37,672
- Jamie. Jamie.
- Behind you, kid! - Randy!

1092
01:22:37,839 --> 01:22:40,550
- Behind ya!
- Look around!

1093
01:22:42,593 --> 01:22:45,846
- Shit. - What?
- We're on 30-second delay.

1094
01:22:46,012 --> 01:22:48,474
Oh, my God.

1095
01:23:41,188 --> 01:23:44,608
- Is there a phone in the van?
- Yeah.

1096
01:23:44,775 --> 01:23:48,236
Lock yourself in it.
Call the sheriff for backup.

1097
01:23:49,821 --> 01:23:51,739
Be careful!

1098
01:24:04,919 --> 01:24:06,837
Neil?

1099
01:24:12,342 --> 01:24:14,261
Mr Prescott?

1100
01:24:16,430 --> 01:24:18,348
Shit!

1101
01:24:34,362 --> 01:24:36,282
Kenny, I need the cellular!

1102
01:24:40,285 --> 01:24:42,870
Kenny!

1103
01:24:43,037 --> 01:24:44,955
Kenny!

1104
01:25:09,979 --> 01:25:12,940
- 9-1-1.
- What's going on?

1105
01:25:25,493 --> 01:25:27,328
Oh, God!

1106
01:26:02,372 --> 01:26:04,665
Dewey!

1107
01:26:04,832 --> 01:26:06,750
Dewey, where are you?

1108
01:26:08,961 --> 01:26:11,797
Dewey!

1109
01:26:11,964 --> 01:26:14,466
Sidney?

1110
01:26:18,386 --> 01:26:20,597
Dewey!

1111
01:26:48,247 --> 01:26:50,624
Shit!

1112
01:27:15,898 --> 01:27:19,818
7825, suspect at
105 North Avenue 52.

1113
01:27:19,985 --> 01:27:22,779
Hello. Help me, please. I'm at
Stu Marker's house on Turner Lane.

1114
01:27:22,946 --> 01:27:27,201
It's 261 Turner Lane.
Please, he's gonna try and kill me.

1115
01:27:49,805 --> 01:27:52,932
Sidney!
Sidney!

1116
01:27:53,099 --> 01:27:55,435
Jesus, we've got to get
the fuck out of here!

1117
01:27:55,602 --> 01:27:56,371
Stop right there!

1118
01:27:56,397 --> 01:27:58,838
Don't shoot. It's me! I found Tatum.
She's dead.

1119
01:27:58,980 --> 01:27:59,832
I think Stu did it.

1120
01:27:59,858 --> 01:28:01,966
Don't listen to him, Sidney!
- Stay back!

1121
01:28:02,108 --> 01:28:04,151
Stu did it. He killed Billy!
He killed my Tatum!

1122
01:28:04,177 --> 01:28:04,843
You did it!

1123
01:28:04,985 --> 01:28:07,738
- He killed my Tatum!
- No, I didn't! - You lie!

1124
01:28:07,905 --> 01:28:11,491
Sidney, baby, please, give me that gun!
Give me that gun! Christ, man!

1125
01:28:11,658 --> 01:28:14,744
No, I didn't. No, I didn't.
Sid, he did it!

1126
01:28:14,911 --> 01:28:18,331
He did it, Sidney! Please,
I didn't do it. He did it. Please!

1127
01:28:18,498 --> 01:28:20,959
- Please, Sidney. Oh!
- Fuck you both!

1128
01:28:21,125 --> 01:28:24,587
- Please!
- No! No! Sidney!

1129
01:28:24,753 --> 01:28:27,966
- Open up!
- He did it!

1130
01:28:28,132 --> 01:28:31,177
Help me!
He's going crazy!

1131
01:28:31,343 --> 01:28:33,303
- Sidney!
- Go away!

1132
01:28:33,470 --> 01:28:35,680
Sidney?

1133
01:28:35,847 --> 01:28:37,766
Leave me alone.

1134
01:28:43,438 --> 01:28:45,856
- Sid.
- Billy.

1135
01:28:52,071 --> 01:28:54,073
Oh! Billy. Billy.
Are you okay?

1136
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:56,992
- I'm okay.
- I thought you were dead.

1137
01:28:57,158 --> 01:28:59,870
No, I'm like a stuck pig,
but I'm all right.

1138
01:29:00,037 --> 01:29:02,039
- Get up.
- Help me.

1139
01:29:02,205 --> 01:29:05,166
- I'm okay.
- You're bleeding.

1140
01:29:05,333 --> 01:29:07,877
- Oh, my God. - We've gotta get help.
- No, he's out there.

1141
01:29:08,044 --> 01:29:10,547
No, give me the gun.
Give me the gun. It's okay.

1142
01:29:10,713 --> 01:29:12,757
It's okay. It's okay.

1143
01:29:12,924 --> 01:29:14,842
Careful.

1144
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:18,637
- Please help me!
- Come in, come in!

1145
01:29:18,804 --> 01:29:20,931
Stu's flipped out!
He's gone mad!

1146
01:29:23,433 --> 01:29:25,518
We all go a little mad
sometimes.

1147
01:29:25,685 --> 01:29:28,062
- No, Billy!
- Oh, fuck!

1148
01:29:34,652 --> 01:29:36,821
Anthony Perkins, "Psycho."

1149
01:29:43,827 --> 01:29:47,539
Corn syrup. Same stuff they used
for pig's blood in "Carrie."

1150
01:29:51,834 --> 01:29:54,295
Stu.
Help me, please.

1151
01:29:57,089 --> 01:30:00,009
Surprise, Sidney.

1152
01:30:03,304 --> 01:30:05,848
- No!
- Ooh!

1153
01:30:06,015 --> 01:30:08,600
Oh, now. Whoa.

1154
01:30:11,227 --> 01:30:15,232
What's the matter, Sidney?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

1155
01:30:15,398 --> 01:30:18,609
- Why are you doing this?
- It's all part of the game, Sidney.

1156
01:30:18,776 --> 01:30:21,445
- It's called "Guess How I'm Gonna Die."
- Fuck you!

1157
01:30:21,612 --> 01:30:26,117
No, no, no, no, no.
We already played that game, remember?

1158
01:30:26,283 --> 01:30:29,286
- You lost.
- It's a fun game, Sidney.

1159
01:30:29,453 --> 01:30:32,330
See, we ask you a question,
and if you get it wrong...

1160
01:30:32,497 --> 01:30:34,583
"boo-kah," you die!

1161
01:30:34,750 --> 01:30:37,711
You get it right,
you die.

1162
01:30:37,877 --> 01:30:39,125
You're crazy, both of you.

1163
01:30:39,151 --> 01:30:41,405
Actually, we prefer
the term "psychotic."

1164
01:30:41,547 --> 01:30:45,385
- You'll never get away with this.
- Oh, no?

1165
01:30:46,552 --> 01:30:48,679
Tell that to Cotton Weary.

1166
01:30:48,846 --> 01:30:51,515
You wouldn't believe
how easy he was to frame.

1167
01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:55,476
Watch a few movies,
take a few notes.

1168
01:30:55,644 --> 01:30:57,896
- It was fun.
- No!

1169
01:30:58,063 --> 01:31:01,399
- Whoa!
- Where're you goin'?

1170
01:31:01,566 --> 01:31:05,611
Why? Why did you kill my mother?

1171
01:31:05,778 --> 01:31:10,199
Why? Why?

1172
01:31:10,366 --> 01:31:14,327
Did you hear that, Stu?
I think she wants a motive.

1173
01:31:14,494 --> 01:31:16,106
Well, I don't really
believe in motive, Sid.

1174
01:31:16,132 --> 01:31:17,564
I mean, did Norman
Bates have a motive?

1175
01:31:17,706 --> 01:31:20,792
- No. - Did they ever really decide why
Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people?

1176
01:31:20,959 --> 01:31:26,338
Don't think so! See, it's a lot scarier
when there's no motive, Sid.

1177
01:31:26,505 --> 01:31:29,425
We did your mom a favour, Sid.
That woman was a slut-bag whore...

1178
01:31:29,592 --> 01:31:32,511
who flashed her shit all over town like
she was Sharon Stone or something.

1179
01:31:32,678 --> 01:31:34,847
Yeah, we put her out of her misery,
'cause let's face it, Sidney...

1180
01:31:35,013 --> 01:31:38,350
your mother
was no Sharon Stone, hmm?

1181
01:31:43,647 --> 01:31:46,024
Is that motive enough
for you?

1182
01:31:48,442 --> 01:31:51,196
Well, how about this?

1183
01:31:51,362 --> 01:31:55,032
Your slut mother
was fucking my father...

1184
01:31:56,992 --> 01:32:00,538
and she's the reason
my mom moved out and abandoned me.

1185
01:32:02,748 --> 01:32:05,917
How's that for a motive?

1186
01:32:06,084 --> 01:32:08,127
Maternal abandonment causes
serious deviant behaviour.

1187
01:32:08,294 --> 01:32:11,673
It certainly fucked you up.
It made you have sex with a psychopath.

1188
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:16,135
That's right. You gave it up.
Now you're no longer a virgin.

1189
01:32:16,302 --> 01:32:18,220
I said "virgin."
Whoops!

1190
01:32:18,387 --> 01:32:21,224
Now you gotta die.
Those are the rules.

1191
01:32:21,390 --> 01:32:25,477
Let's pretend it's all a scary movie,
Sid. How do you think it's gonna end?

1192
01:32:29,105 --> 01:32:32,359
Oh! Oh! This is the greatest part!
You're gonna love this.

1193
01:32:32,526 --> 01:32:34,903
We got a surprise
for you, Sidney.

1194
01:32:35,069 --> 01:32:37,863
Yeah, you're gonna love this one.
It's a scream, baby!

1195
01:32:38,030 --> 01:32:41,826
Hold on a sec.
I'll be right back.

1196
01:32:41,993 --> 01:32:43,911
You know what time
it is, Sid?

1197
01:32:44,078 --> 01:32:45,996
It's after midnight.

1198
01:32:46,163 --> 01:32:49,749
It's your mom's anniversary.
Congratulations.

1199
01:32:49,916 --> 01:32:53,170
We killed her exactly
one year ago today.

1200
01:32:53,337 --> 01:32:57,257
Attention! Oh, what do we have
behind door number three, Sidney?

1201
01:32:57,423 --> 01:33:01,552
- Daddy!
- Whoa, hold it. That's enough.

1202
01:33:01,719 --> 01:33:04,222
Guess we won't be needing
this any more, huh?

1203
01:33:04,389 --> 01:33:07,558
And, oh, look at this.
Ring, ring. Won't need this.

1204
01:33:07,725 --> 01:33:09,726
- Got the ending figured out yet, Sid?
- Come on, Sidney.

1205
01:33:09,893 --> 01:33:11,459
You think about it now, huh?

1206
01:33:11,485 --> 01:33:14,673
Your daddy's the chief suspect.
We cloned his cellular.

1207
01:33:14,815 --> 01:33:17,651
- The evidence is all right there, baby!
- What if your father snapped?

1208
01:33:17,817 --> 01:33:19,407
Your mother's anniversary
set him off,

1209
01:33:19,433 --> 01:33:21,429
and he went on a murder
spree, killing everyone.

1210
01:33:21,570 --> 01:33:23,739
Except for Billy and me.
We were left for dead.

1211
01:33:23,906 --> 01:33:26,951
Then he kills you...

1212
01:33:27,118 --> 01:33:29,662
and shoots himself
in the head.

1213
01:33:29,828 --> 01:33:33,373
- Perfect ending.
- I thought of that.

1214
01:33:33,540 --> 01:33:35,459
Watch this.

1215
01:33:39,504 --> 01:33:43,633
- Ready?
- Yeah. Yeah! I'm ready, baby!

1216
01:33:43,799 --> 01:33:47,762
Right! Get up!
Yeah, babe, get up! Hit it!

1217
01:33:52,683 --> 01:33:55,143
Good one, man. Jesus.

1218
01:33:55,310 --> 01:33:59,231
Oh, shit.
My turn.

1219
01:34:01,900 --> 01:34:04,402
Don't forget. Stay to the side
and don't go too deep.

1220
01:34:06,112 --> 01:34:08,114
Okay. I'll remember.

1221
01:34:09,282 --> 01:34:12,618
Fuck! Fuck!

1222
01:34:12,785 --> 01:34:15,162
Fuck!
Goddamn it, Stu!

1223
01:34:15,329 --> 01:34:19,416
Sorry, Billy. I guess I got
a little too zealous, huh?

1224
01:34:19,583 --> 01:34:22,461
- Give me the knife.
- No.

1225
01:34:22,627 --> 01:34:25,672
Give me the knife!

1226
01:34:27,256 --> 01:34:30,176
Now!

1227
01:34:31,594 --> 01:34:36,140
You see, Sid, everybody dies but us.
Everybody dies but us.

1228
01:34:36,306 --> 01:34:38,851
We get to carry on
and plan the sequel...

1229
01:34:39,018 --> 01:34:43,146
'cause let's face it, baby,
these days ya gotta have a sequel!

1230
01:34:46,024 --> 01:34:48,776
You sick fucks.
You've seen one too many movies.

1231
01:34:48,943 --> 01:34:51,363
Now, Sid, don't you
blame the movies.

1232
01:34:51,529 --> 01:34:53,029
Movies don't create psychos.

1233
01:34:53,536 --> 01:34:57,206
I feel a little woozy here!

1234
01:35:00,042 --> 01:35:02,042
All right, you get the gun.

1235
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:04,924
And I'll untie Pops, okay?

1236
01:35:07,384 --> 01:35:10,470
- Now!
- Okay.

1237
01:35:22,314 --> 01:35:25,902
Houston, we--
we have a problem here.

1238
01:35:27,987 --> 01:35:30,489
- What?
- The gun, man. The gun.

1239
01:35:30,656 --> 01:35:34,159
I put it right there,
and it's not there.

1240
01:35:34,325 --> 01:35:37,496
- Where the fuck is it?
- Right here, asshole.

1241
01:35:39,998 --> 01:35:42,583
- Man, I thought she was dead.
- She looked dead, man.

1242
01:35:42,750 --> 01:35:45,420
- Still does.
- I've got an ending for you.

1243
01:35:45,587 --> 01:35:48,506
The reporter left for dead
in the news van...

1244
01:35:48,673 --> 01:35:50,633
comes to...

1245
01:35:50,799 --> 01:35:55,261
stumbles on you two dipshits,
finds the gun...

1246
01:35:55,428 --> 01:36:00,142
foils your plan
and saves the day.

1247
01:36:00,308 --> 01:36:03,519
I like that ending.

1248
01:36:03,686 --> 01:36:06,606
I know something
you don't.

1249
01:36:08,608 --> 01:36:11,152
Fuck. No!

1250
01:36:14,071 --> 01:36:16,281
Yeah, man.

1251
01:36:16,448 --> 01:36:20,119
Yeah. Aw, so sweet.

1252
01:36:25,289 --> 01:36:29,711
It works better
without the safety on.

1253
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:38,427
This is Gale Weathers
signing off.

1254
01:36:38,594 --> 01:36:40,596
Babe, you're gonna
love this!

1255
01:36:42,973 --> 01:36:44,891
Shit.

1256
01:36:46,559 --> 01:36:48,477
What?

1257
01:36:54,317 --> 01:36:56,652
Where are they?
Where are they?

1258
01:36:56,819 --> 01:36:58,737
I don't know, Billy,
but I'm hurtin', man.

1259
01:36:58,904 --> 01:37:02,074
Fuck!

1260
01:37:02,241 --> 01:37:05,786
Shall I let
the machine get it?

1261
01:37:05,952 --> 01:37:08,621
- Hello?
- Are you alone in the house?

1262
01:37:08,788 --> 01:37:10,999
Bitch! You bitch!
Where the fuck are you?

1263
01:37:11,166 --> 01:37:14,002
Not so fast.
We're gonna play a little game.

1264
01:37:14,169 --> 01:37:16,386
It's called "Guess Who
Just Called The Police

1265
01:37:16,412 --> 01:37:18,531
And Reported Your Sorry
Motherfucking Ass."

1266
01:37:18,672 --> 01:37:20,158
Find her, you dipshit! Get up!

1267
01:37:20,184 --> 01:37:22,660
I can't, Billy. You
already cut me too deep.

1268
01:37:22,802 --> 01:37:24,887
I think I'm dying here, man.

1269
01:37:28,098 --> 01:37:30,016
Talk to her.
Talk to her.

1270
01:37:36,981 --> 01:37:40,526
- Hello?
- Oh, Stu, Stu, Stu.

1271
01:37:40,693 --> 01:37:42,612
What's your motive?
Billy's got one.

1272
01:37:42,779 --> 01:37:44,822
The police are on their way.
What are you gonna tell them?

1273
01:37:44,989 --> 01:37:47,282
Peer pressure.
I'm far too sensitive.

1274
01:37:47,449 --> 01:37:49,743
I'm gonna rip you up, you bitch,
just like your fucking mother!

1275
01:37:49,910 --> 01:37:53,414
- You've gotta find me first, you
pansy-assed mama's boy! - Fuck!

1276
01:37:53,580 --> 01:37:57,751
Ow. You fuckin' hit me
with the phone, dick!

1277
01:37:57,917 --> 01:37:59,836
Fucker, where are you?

1278
01:38:01,504 --> 01:38:03,423
You fuck!

1279
01:38:05,008 --> 01:38:08,928
- Did you really call the police?
- You bet your sorry ass I did.

1280
01:38:09,094 --> 01:38:12,305
My mom and dad are
gonna be so mad at me.

1281
01:38:13,933 --> 01:38:15,851
Bitch!

1282
01:39:12,486 --> 01:39:14,530
My arm!

1283
01:39:21,620 --> 01:39:23,955
I always had
a thing for ya, Sid!

1284
01:39:44,321 --> 01:39:45,189
I'm sorry. It's all right.

1285
01:39:45,215 --> 01:39:46,849
Oh, my God, Randy. I
thought you were dead.

1286
01:39:46,991 --> 01:39:50,410
I probably should be. I never thought
I'd be so happy to be a virgin.

1287
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:54,997
Fucker!

1288
01:39:59,836 --> 01:40:02,421
Say hello to your mother.

1289
01:40:40,333 --> 01:40:43,085
Guess I remembered
the safety that time, you bastard.

1290
01:40:56,014 --> 01:40:58,141
Careful. This is the moment...

1291
01:40:58,308 --> 01:41:03,062
when the supposedly dead killer comes
back to life for one last scare.

1292
01:41:08,192 --> 01:41:11,070
Not in my movie.

1293
01:41:15,741 --> 01:41:19,369
Dad.
Randy, help me out.

1294
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:27,418
- Ow. Aah.
- Are you okay?

1295
01:41:27,585 --> 01:41:30,255
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1296
01:41:31,798 --> 01:41:33,716
- Hang in there, buddy.
- All right.

1297
01:41:36,343 --> 01:41:38,345
- Over here.
- Sorry, kid.

1298
01:41:38,511 --> 01:41:43,141
Okay, I think it's going to go
something like this. Just stay with me.

1299
01:41:43,308 --> 01:41:46,603
Hi, this is Gale Weathers
with an exclusive eyewitness account...

1300
01:41:46,769 --> 01:41:49,605
of this amazing breaking story.

1301
01:41:49,772 --> 01:41:52,108
Several more local teens
are dead...

1302
01:41:52,275 --> 01:41:55,111
bringing to an end the harrowing
mystery of the mass killing...

1303
01:41:55,277 --> 01:41:57,780
that has terrified
this peaceful community...

1304
01:41:57,946 --> 01:42:00,615
like the plot
of some scary movie.

1305
01:42:00,740 --> 01:42:03,202
It all began with
a scream over 9-1-1...

1306
01:42:03,369 --> 01:42:07,539
and ended in a bloodbath that has
rocked the town of Woodsboro...

1307
01:42:07,705 --> 01:42:10,124
all played out here
in this peaceful farmhouse...

1308
01:42:10,291 --> 01:42:12,794
far from the crimes and
the sirens of the larger cities...

1309
01:42:12,961 --> 01:42:14,963
that its residents
had fled.

1310
01:42:15,129 --> 01:42:17,715
Okay, let's take it back to one.
Come on. Move it.

1311
01:42:17,882 --> 01:42:20,467
This is my big shot.
Let's go.

1312
01:42:52,076 --> 01:42:56,206
Love comes down upon us
and it flows like water

1313
01:42:56,336 --> 01:43:00,423
Burning with the hope
of insight

1314
01:43:00,553 --> 01:43:04,553
There the books, the colours
of a bright elation

1315
01:43:04,683 --> 01:43:08,727
Stolen in the sight of love

1316
01:43:08,814 --> 01:43:12,857
We are, we are, we are
We're just children

1317
01:43:12,987 --> 01:43:17,030
Fighting our way
around indecision

1318
01:43:17,161 --> 01:43:21,204
We are, we are, we are
rather helpless

1319
01:43:21,334 --> 01:43:28,073
Stay kids forever
A whisper to a scream

1320
01:43:33,855 --> 01:43:37,811
Birds fly in the eye
of the faithless daughters

1321
01:43:37,941 --> 01:43:42,071
Spoken at the bitter end

1322
01:43:42,202 --> 01:43:46,245
Wasted, sacrificed
for the new nirvana

1323
01:43:46,419 --> 01:43:50,462
Nighttime sends us on our way

1324
01:43:50,592 --> 01:43:54,548
We are, we are, we are
We're just children

1325
01:43:54,679 --> 01:43:58,635
Fighting our way
around indecision

1326
01:43:58,765 --> 01:44:02,895
We are, we are, we are
rather helpless

1327
01:44:03,026 --> 01:44:08,982
Stay kids forever
A whisper to a scream

1328
01:44:09,112 --> 01:44:13,546
A whisper to a scream

1329
01:44:13,677 --> 01:44:17,502
Whisper to a scream

1330
01:44:17,633 --> 01:44:23,893
A whisper to a scream

1331
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:36,153
We are, we are, we are
We're just children

1332
01:44:36,283 --> 01:44:40,457
Fighting our way
around indecision

1333
01:44:40,587 --> 01:44:44,630
We are, we are, we are
rather helpless

1334
01:44:44,761 --> 01:44:48,978
Stay kids forever
A whisper to a scream

1335
01:44:49,108 --> 01:44:53,064
- Whisper to a scream
- A whisper to a scream

1336
01:44:53,195 --> 01:44:57,325
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream

1337
01:44:57,455 --> 01:45:01,498
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream

1338
01:45:01,629 --> 01:45:05,672
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream

1339
01:45:05,802 --> 01:45:09,845
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream

1340
01:45:09,932 --> 01:45:13,975
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream

1341
01:45:14,106 --> 01:45:19,975
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream

1342
01:45:20,105 --> 01:45:23,887
Whisper to a scream

1343
01:47:13,094 --> 01:47:17,007
Look outside of my window

1344
01:47:19,181 --> 01:47:22,963
But all I see
is the rain come down

1345
01:47:24,615 --> 01:47:29,397
A pink umbrella
and a bit of her lace

1346
01:47:29,527 --> 01:47:34,744
Is all I need
and I'll come, come

1347
01:47:34,875 --> 01:47:38,874
I don't care
if you don't care

1348
01:47:40,396 --> 01:47:43,569
The world looks
just fine to me

1349
01:47:45,700 --> 01:47:50,873
Don't be shy
and I'll show you, baby

1350
01:47:51,004 --> 01:47:55,568
What's it like to be free

1351
01:48:03,002 --> 01:48:08,132
I don't care
if you don't care

1352
01:48:08,263 --> 01:48:11,958
The world looks
just fine to me

1353
01:48:13,740 --> 01:48:18,870
Don't be shy
and I'll show you, baby

1354
01:48:19,001 --> 01:48:24,609
What it's like to be free

1355
01:48:30,565 --> 01:48:34,869
I

1356
01:48:34,999 --> 01:48:40,216
I don't care
if you don't care

1357
01:48:40,347 --> 01:48:43,955
The world looks
just fine to me

1358
01:48:45,694 --> 01:48:50,780
Don't be shy
and I'll show you, baby

1359
01:48:50,911 --> 01:48:57,171
What it's like to be free

1360
01:49:07,257 --> 01:49:10,344
- Don't be shy
- Told you, baby

1361
01:49:10,474 --> 01:49:12,952
Don't be shy
