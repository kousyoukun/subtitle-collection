00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,640
BELL RINGS MAN CLEARS THROAT

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,200
Agh! I must be dreaming, you're actually here early.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,960
Sir, yes, sir. All present and accounted for.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,840
Eh? Erm, not quite.

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,920
Where's Colin?

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,320
HE SINGS IN OPERATIC VOICE

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,440
Colin! Colin, Colin!

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,400
Hey, Colin, Colin, Colin! Wake up!

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,240
- Wake up, we're on in five. 
- Oh, crumpets. Must have fallen asleep.

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,840
Positions, everyone!

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,560
This is Brain Freeze.

12
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,920
With Dr Knowles...

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,440
..Professor McCork...

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,960
..and Colin the floor manager.

15
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,480
Stand by!

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,840
- Hi, folks, and welcome to Brain Freeze. 
- It's time to reveal...

17
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,600
- Today's Big Question! 
- Today we're asking, why do we dream?

18
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,880
Do you know something? I don't think I've ever had a dream myself.

19
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,120
That's impossible, Professor. Everybody dreams every night.

20
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,480
For about two hours,

21
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,200
which adds up to about six years of our lives spent dreaming.

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,680
And how do you know that?

23
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,080
By studying people's brainwaves while they sleep.

24
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,400
There are five stages of sleep.

25
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,640
This is stage one, when you're dropping off.

26
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,560
Then as you move into stages two, three and stage four...

27
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,600
the waves get bigger and slower.

28
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,000
- But what's this? 
- Agh! My body's asleep but my brain is awake.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,360
What's going on?

30
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,520
Ah, he's entered the stage known as REM sleep, or rapid eye movement.

31
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,720
We know that most dreams occur during this stage. Unless you wake up

32
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,200
during or soon after REM, you're unlikely to remember any dreams.

33
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,280
Agh! Killer ducky! Cut to commercial, cut to commercial!

34
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,280
BELL RINGS

35
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,400
# La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la!

36
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,880
# La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la! #

37
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,880
Oh, maybe don't give up the day job just yet, Colin.

38
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,160
- You... You don't like my singing? 
- No, it's not that, Colin.

39
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,800
You should try breathing more from the diaphragm, you know?

40
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,200
Not the lungs. And then expel the air, like this.

41
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,760
SHE BELTS OUT POWERFUL NOTE

42
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,040
Wow! Great pipes, Doctor.

43
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,200
- Thanks. 
- Right.

44
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,640
We're live in five, four, three, two, one.

45
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,040
This just in from Jasmine, who wonders if dreaming has a use.

46
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,520
Oh, oh, I know the answer to this one.

47
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,520
Some scientists say that dreams help us to organise our memories,

48
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,240
while others think they enhance our creativity.

49
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,360
But others reckon it's just our brain making a story out of random

50
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,040
- nerve activity. 
- So basically, we haven't a clue.

51
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,320
Well, the truth is, science still hasn't solved

52
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,760
the mystery of why we dream, but here are some things we do know.

53
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,240
Finally, something.

54
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,480
Babies spend more than twice as long in REM sleep as adults,

55
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,840
which suggests that dreaming plays a role in brain development.

56
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,360
The same is true of kittens and puppies.

57
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,720
So you mean animals dream too?

58
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,000
Well, some mammals have REM but what exactly they're dreaming about,

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,840
we'll probably never know.

60
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,680
Today's Big Answer!

61
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,640
We really haven't the foggiest about dreaming, do we?

62
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,680
Other than that it's got something to do with brain development...

63
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,480
- Meh. 
- Fair enough.

64
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,760
- So that's it for today. 
- See you next time. Sweet dreams, folks.

65
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,440
And we're clear!

66
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,360
Ahem. # La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la! #

67
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,160
Oh, I know. I'm just a dreamer with no talent.

68
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,240
- You do too. 
- I do?

69
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,880
Well, you're the best floor manager ever.

70
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,880
And who says dreams can't come true? Eh?
