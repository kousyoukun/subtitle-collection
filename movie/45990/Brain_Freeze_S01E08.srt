- No, Dr Knowles. Late again.

00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,360
- As usual. 
- You seem a bit under the weather.

3
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,600
It's like there's a cloud hanging over me.

# Brain Freeze! #

16
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,600
- Hi, folks. Welcome to Brain Freeze! 
- It's time to reveal...

17
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,080
- Today we're asking where do clouds come from? 
- Clowns?

18
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,440
- I'm sure everyone knows they come from the circus! 
- Not clowns, clouds!

19
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,320
Oh, whoo!

20
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,840
As we all know, water occurs as a liquid and a solid,

21
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,960
- but it also occurs as a gas called water vapour. 
- That's news to me.

22
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,080
You see, water floats around us

23
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,080
all the time, in the form of tiny gas particles.

24
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,240
As the sun heats water on the earth,

25
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,240
these particles rise up in a process known as evaporation.

26
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,920
Up, up and away!

27
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,280
As they rise up, they bump into other small particles called aerosols.

28
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,880
Aerosols are tiny little bits of dust and salt

29
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,080
and other stuff floating around in the air.

30
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,240
As the air gets cooler, water vapour sticks to the aerosols,

31
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,520
forming droplets,

32
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,840
and these droplets eventually come together to form clouds.

33
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,720
- This is called condensation. 
- Heh!

34
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,320
And there was me thinking they were made of candyfloss!

35
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,800
We'll be right back after this break.

Hey, Colin, do you know what the best cure for the blues is?

00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,760
Laughter. Hit it, lads.

00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,960
Welcome back, Brain Freezers. So, Dr Knowles, condensation.

52
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,080
Where were we?

53
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,480
Well, as the air continues to rise and cool,

54
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,200
clouds begin to merge and grow,

55
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,640
and as the droplets within the clouds start to stick together,

56
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,320
they become too heavy to resist the pull of gravity,

57
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,560
and fall to Earth as precipitation.

58
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,520
- Precipi-what now? 
- Precipitation.

59
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,760
- Snow, sleet or rain! 
- We know all about rain, don't we, Colin?

SAD PIANO TUNE, THUNDER

61
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,400
This water then collects in oceans, rivers and lakes,

62
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:54,080
ready to start the process all over again. We call this the water cycle.

63
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,320
So, hang on.

64
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,480
You're saying it's the same water going around and around and around?

65
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,120
Exactly!

66
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,440
In fact, the water in your glass could be the same water that

67
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,920
a dinosaur drank millions of years ago!

68
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,680
Blech! I knew it tasted a bit funny! Keh!

69
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,840
Anyway, folks, there you have it.

70
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,640
So now you know how clouds are formed.

71
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:21,400
And they are not, I repeat, not made of candyfloss! See you next time!

Hey, Colin, I have an idea that might make you feel better.

00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,800
- Please, Doctor, it's just no use. 
- Hmmm!

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,640
What?!

78
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:40,120

- Any good? 
- Oh, you know what? I think I really needed that.

79
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,520
- Sometimes a simple hug can do the world of good. 
- Oh, thank you, Doctor!

80
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,160
Hey, can I have a hug? Where's my hug? Is someone giving out hugs?

81
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,920
Someone give me a hug!
