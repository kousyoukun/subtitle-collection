1
00:01:07,449 --> 00:01:09,185
<i>Moving towards
the north-west sector.</i>

2
00:01:32,274 --> 00:01:33,909
<i>Unit 3 on the move.</i>

3
00:01:33,943 --> 00:01:36,712
<i>Heading towards
the south-west sector.</i>

4
00:01:41,483 --> 00:01:43,653
<i>I repeat! Do not
exceed the ratio.</i>

5
00:01:45,453 --> 00:01:48,925
<i>Another win for biotech m.</i>

6
00:02:16,785 --> 00:02:18,454
Hey, andré!

7
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:34,837
<i>You're listening to 95.8,
the number one station</i>

8
00:02:34,869 --> 00:02:37,606
<i>in the city and I'm
Patrick nault.</i>

9
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,875
<i>Let's get real here, alright?</i>

10
00:02:39,908 --> 00:02:43,411
<i>We live, in a left-wing
dictatorship run by goddam green</i>

11
00:02:43,445 --> 00:02:46,649
<i>fascists, who want us to be
content drowning in our white</i>

12
00:02:46,682 --> 00:02:49,552
<i>shit. How about clearing
the snow from our streets</i>

13
00:02:49,584 --> 00:02:52,887
<i>assholes? And if you don't
drive, do us a favour</i>

14
00:02:52,921 --> 00:02:54,890
<i>and stay home.</i>

15
00:02:54,922 --> 00:02:57,860
<i>Anyway... traffic's gonna be
a mess all day today.</i>

16
00:02:57,892 --> 00:03:01,363
<i>Speaking of winter, you know
those pretentious assholes</i>

17
00:03:01,397 --> 00:03:03,366
<i>on peacock island who turn
their noses up at us?</i>

18
00:03:03,398 --> 00:03:06,001
<i>Well, the peacocks on peacock
island don't like winter.</i>

19
00:03:06,035 --> 00:03:07,937
<i>You wanna know why?</i>

20
00:03:07,969 --> 00:03:09,771
<i>They can't play golf
in the winter.</i>

21
00:03:11,906 --> 00:03:15,677
<i>So these entitled islanders,
have more money than god</i>

22
00:03:15,711 --> 00:03:17,546
<i>and don't know what
to do with it.</i>

23
00:03:17,578 --> 00:03:19,714
<i>And they're such
massive, entitled snobs!</i>

24
00:03:19,748 --> 00:03:22,351
Hey!!! Don't text and ride, kid!

25
00:03:22,384 --> 00:03:24,487
What?

26
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:26,388
Don't text while you're riding!

27
00:03:26,422 --> 00:03:27,866
I'm not texting, I'm
watching a video!

28
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,625
It's red!

29
00:03:31,993 --> 00:03:34,796
Little shit.

30
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,767
<i>Yeah sure, winter's here, but
not for the rich who just wanna</i>

31
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,668
<i>golf all year round.</i>

32
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:41,836
<i>That bunch of snobs don't
give a damn about anything.</i>

33
00:03:41,869 --> 00:03:44,339
<i>Not even nature.</i>

34
00:03:44,373 --> 00:03:46,684
<i>Listen, I've got nothing against
the rich, the really rich,</i>

35
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:49,911
<i>mind you, but these pretenders
spewing their liberal views</i>

36
00:03:49,945 --> 00:03:52,848
<i>piss me right off...</i>

37
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,683
<i>Know what I'm saying?
They drive me crazy.</i>

38
00:03:54,717 --> 00:03:57,352
<i>You can bitch and complain
to me all you want,</i>

39
00:03:57,386 --> 00:03:59,856
<i>but the world is going
to hell, and I've had it.</i>

40
00:04:27,816 --> 00:04:29,885
Do you want some
salt on your giraffe?

41
00:04:29,917 --> 00:04:32,655
No? It's okay like that?

42
00:04:32,687 --> 00:04:34,489
Ah! Like that?

43
00:04:34,523 --> 00:04:36,458
Hello, andré!

44
00:04:36,492 --> 00:04:40,429
« hello, Camilla,
how are you Camilla,

45
00:04:40,461 --> 00:04:42,598
did you have a nice day Camilla?

46
00:04:42,631 --> 00:04:44,700
How's Annie?
Is she still teething?

47
00:04:44,732 --> 00:04:48,603
Hope it's not too painful?

48
00:04:48,636 --> 00:04:50,605
Hello andré.

49
00:04:50,638 --> 00:04:53,641
No, your mother is not home yet.

50
00:04:53,675 --> 00:04:57,078
Annie, say hi to your brother.

51
00:04:57,112 --> 00:04:59,082
Huh?

52
00:05:37,953 --> 00:05:40,155
Hi, pat, you done,
I'll pick you up?

53
00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:42,191
Dad! I told you,
I'm busy after...

54
00:05:42,223 --> 00:05:43,858
After what?

55
00:05:43,891 --> 00:05:45,894
After work, silly!

56
00:05:45,927 --> 00:05:48,596
Ah, okay. So we're
not eating together?

57
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:51,699
Dad... go out, see other
people, do something fun.

58
00:05:51,732 --> 00:05:53,701
No, it's okay, I've got
something "after" too.

59
00:05:53,735 --> 00:05:55,604
Yeah, I know
what that something is,

60
00:05:55,636 --> 00:05:57,206
and it's kinda weird.

61
00:05:57,239 --> 00:05:59,008
And what about you?
What are you doing after?

62
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:03,112
You don't want to know!
Bye, love you.

63
00:06:03,145 --> 00:06:06,916
Bye.

64
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,243
- André?
- Yeah?

65
00:07:41,275 --> 00:07:43,112
Your mom is really late.
I've got to go.

66
00:07:43,145 --> 00:07:44,880
You look after Annie.

67
00:07:44,912 --> 00:07:46,814
Huh? What? No no no no no!

68
00:07:46,848 --> 00:07:49,117
André. My family needs
me too, they're waiting.

69
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,720
Come on, Camilla, please...

70
00:07:51,752 --> 00:07:54,589
What are you so afraid of?
She's not going to eat you!

71
00:07:54,622 --> 00:07:57,759
And she's sleeping now. I put
a bottle in the fridge in case

72
00:07:57,792 --> 00:07:59,694
she wakes up. Okay?

73
00:07:59,727 --> 00:08:01,030
I'll see you, tomorrow.

74
00:08:05,734 --> 00:08:07,903
<i>This is a scary video!</i>

75
00:08:07,936 --> 00:08:09,280
<i>But don't worry,
there are no victims here.</i>

76
00:08:09,304 --> 00:08:13,309
<i>One of the many laws of the
jungle is the need to eat,</i>

77
00:08:13,341 --> 00:08:16,312
<i>but if the prey is
impossible to reach,</i>

78
00:08:16,345 --> 00:08:20,583
<i>the animal soon gives
up to conserve energy.</i>

79
00:08:20,615 --> 00:08:24,252
<i>Big cats vary between being
ferocious and in a vegetative</i>

80
00:08:24,285 --> 00:08:27,355
<i>state until the next chance
they get to bite</i>

81
00:08:27,388 --> 00:08:29,225
<i>into fresh meat.</i>

82
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:40,870
Come on...

83
00:08:46,641 --> 00:08:50,345
Ah...

84
00:09:30,051 --> 00:09:31,753
This should do it.

85
00:09:41,362 --> 00:09:42,964
Shhh! Stop it!

86
00:09:51,205 --> 00:09:53,341
You want a bottle?

87
00:10:04,151 --> 00:10:06,320
Do you want my cell phone? Huh?

88
00:10:06,353 --> 00:10:08,256
Take it!

89
00:10:21,102 --> 00:10:23,037
Rouaaarg! Annie, go to sleep

90
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,372
or the big Teddy's
gonna eat you!

91
00:10:31,112 --> 00:10:33,848
<i>Why should we be prepared?</i>

92
00:10:33,881 --> 00:10:37,386
<i>Power outages, economic crises,
insufficient water supply,</i>

93
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:40,355
<i>contamination, natural
disasters, epidemics.</i>

94
00:10:40,387 --> 00:10:44,192
<i>They're all legitimate reasons
to be prepared for anything.</i>

95
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,995
<i>I'm often asked
why I'm getting ready,</i>

96
00:10:47,027 --> 00:10:49,207
<i>and what scares me. Well, I'm
afraid of just one thing...</i>

97
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,734
Oh boy, dad...

98
00:10:51,766 --> 00:10:53,201
What? What is it?

99
00:11:14,189 --> 00:11:16,824
You can at least
tell me his name.

100
00:11:16,857 --> 00:11:18,893
Mohammed aktir. He's
an imam at a mosque.

101
00:11:18,926 --> 00:11:20,962
Come on.

102
00:11:20,996 --> 00:11:22,405
Okay, his name's
serge tremblay, a lumberjack

103
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:24,132
who likes to crochet
flowered vests.

104
00:11:24,165 --> 00:11:25,900
Get serious...

105
00:11:28,102 --> 00:11:29,814
Who cares what his name
is, what's important is...

106
00:11:29,838 --> 00:11:31,307
He's nice to me.

107
00:11:36,877 --> 00:11:38,980
You can come back when you've
got your papers, okay?

108
00:11:39,014 --> 00:11:41,016
This is ridiculous!
What are you doing?

109
00:11:43,385 --> 00:11:47,489
Are you, uhhh...
Are you intimate?

110
00:11:47,521 --> 00:11:50,124
Yuck, come on, dad! Seriously?

111
00:11:50,157 --> 00:11:54,028
- What? I can ask!
- Uh, no, you can't ask, no!

112
00:11:54,061 --> 00:11:55,997
Get back on the bus
and let us do our job.

113
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,407
You're so
pig-headed, this is ridiculous!

114
00:11:57,431 --> 00:11:59,300
Dad?

115
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,837
What're you doing?

116
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:04,139
Updating your contact photo.

117
00:12:04,171 --> 00:12:06,274
Ah...

118
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:17,118
Let's go get your papers. I'm
not going to let you down.

119
00:12:17,151 --> 00:12:18,853
I said get up!

120
00:12:18,886 --> 00:12:21,055
- Hmm...
- Come on!

121
00:12:21,088 --> 00:12:22,925
Camilla is late
and I've got to go.

122
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:25,059
- Mom? This is crazy.
- What is?

123
00:12:25,093 --> 00:12:27,261
You work too much.

124
00:12:27,295 --> 00:12:28,872
I've got to pay for the house,
school, the car,

125
00:12:28,896 --> 00:12:31,132
- sailing lessons.
- I hate sailing.

126
00:12:31,165 --> 00:12:33,001
It's important to socialize.

127
00:12:33,034 --> 00:12:35,203
I hate socializing.

128
00:12:35,237 --> 00:12:37,405
I do too, but got no choice.

129
00:12:37,439 --> 00:12:39,208
Bye

130
00:12:39,241 --> 00:12:41,276
ah... bye - bye-bye, Annie.

131
00:13:06,668 --> 00:13:09,037
Golfing in the winter...

132
00:13:09,069 --> 00:13:11,205
The rich don't give a shit
about the laws of nature...

133
00:13:11,238 --> 00:13:13,007
Look out!

134
00:13:26,954 --> 00:13:28,924
Josée boisbriand,
leave a message.

135
00:13:28,957 --> 00:13:32,427
Yeah, uh, mom, Camilla
still isn't here yet!

136
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:34,562
I don't know what to do?

137
00:13:34,596 --> 00:13:36,198
Call me!

138
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,901
Oh boy...

139
00:13:48,977 --> 00:13:50,446
Wanna have lunch together?

140
00:13:52,347 --> 00:13:54,382
Bye dad.

141
00:13:54,415 --> 00:13:57,151
- I'll pick you up after work!
- See ya.

142
00:14:37,224 --> 00:14:39,393
Here we are...

143
00:14:39,426 --> 00:14:43,497
Oh, thank you...
Oh yes, my love, we're here.

144
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:45,599
Maud! Marcel! How are you?

145
00:14:45,632 --> 00:14:47,435
Our genius!

146
00:14:50,572 --> 00:14:52,741
Don't mind her! Come on! Ruby!

147
00:14:52,774 --> 00:14:55,610
Quite the guard dog. You must
feel very safe with her around.

148
00:14:55,642 --> 00:14:58,312
You're going
to surprise us, I hope!

149
00:14:58,346 --> 00:15:00,115
The course is ready!

150
00:15:00,147 --> 00:15:02,050
Your members will
get their money's worth.

151
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,653
If they played two rounds
a day, every day of the year,

152
00:15:04,685 --> 00:15:06,988
they still wouldn't get
their money's worth!

153
00:15:07,021 --> 00:15:09,223
Golf is, it's not
a sport or a game,

154
00:15:09,256 --> 00:15:11,425
it's a social status.

155
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:14,228
Oh, come on now, Ruby!

156
00:15:14,261 --> 00:15:16,765
Let's go...

157
00:15:16,798 --> 00:15:19,535
Ah, good girl, ah,
that's my precious...

158
00:15:24,104 --> 00:15:27,074
<i>Meanwhile, our city is overrun
with the poor and immigrants who</i>

159
00:15:27,107 --> 00:15:30,645
<i>we have to support because
we're good, kind people.</i>

160
00:15:30,678 --> 00:15:33,415
<i>We're doormats. We let them in
like it's some fricken hotel</i>

161
00:15:33,448 --> 00:15:36,218
<i>and we pay for their room.</i>

162
00:15:36,251 --> 00:15:38,687
<i>That's just... it's
just common sense!</i>

163
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:42,023
<i>We're living beyond our
means, can't you see that?</i>

164
00:15:42,056 --> 00:15:45,359
<i>Hey guys, real life is
no walk in the park...</i>

165
00:15:45,392 --> 00:15:49,064
<i>Okay, time to wake up.</i>

166
00:15:49,097 --> 00:15:51,533
<i>You're listening to 95.8
the city's number one station</i>

167
00:15:51,565 --> 00:15:53,134
<i>with Patrick nault.</i>

168
00:16:09,617 --> 00:16:13,021
Annie! You almost broke the TV!

169
00:16:20,828 --> 00:16:22,631
Aw shit...

170
00:16:22,664 --> 00:16:27,369
Undo the diaper... like this.

171
00:16:27,401 --> 00:16:31,172
Try folding it
up to keep everything in.

172
00:16:31,205 --> 00:16:33,841
We don't want
anything dropping out.

173
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:37,379
There may be a variety
of colors, that's normal.

174
00:16:37,411 --> 00:16:39,247
Yellow, green, brown.

175
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,848
You may notice a
smell, don't worry.

176
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:44,486
Quickly put on the clean diaper.

177
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:48,123
Use the piece of tape
and seal it closed.

178
00:16:48,155 --> 00:16:51,827
Or you might be in for
a nasty surprise.

179
00:17:15,383 --> 00:17:18,453
- Give me a seven iron.
- He said he wants a seven iron!

180
00:17:18,485 --> 00:17:21,622
Okay...

181
00:17:21,655 --> 00:17:23,425
Chill out.

182
00:17:29,496 --> 00:17:31,365
<i>Hey! Leave me a message!</i>

183
00:17:41,209 --> 00:17:42,844
Hurry up, okay honey!
Ruby's waiting

184
00:17:42,876 --> 00:17:46,213
for us in the clubhouse
and she must be so bored.

185
00:17:46,246 --> 00:17:47,715
Golf is so slow, isn't it?

186
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:16,177
Yes, ha ha ha!
You're starting to give me

187
00:18:16,211 --> 00:18:19,615
a hard on, you dirty girl!

188
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:25,619
Uh-huh.

189
00:18:25,653 --> 00:18:28,357
Uh-huh.

190
00:18:31,459 --> 00:18:32,828
Uh-huh.

191
00:18:41,269 --> 00:18:43,572
It'll be worth the wait...

192
00:18:43,605 --> 00:18:45,507
I'll be there in five minutes.

193
00:18:47,407 --> 00:18:49,777
Okay... bye bye!

194
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:51,646
Ha...

195
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:08,495
<i>Did you know that red pepper
is less bitter and easier</i>

196
00:19:08,529 --> 00:19:10,498
<i>to digest than green pepper?</i>

197
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:15,502
<i>We have several nutritionists
at your disposal to help you</i>

198
00:19:15,536 --> 00:19:18,673
<i>with selecting the foods
that are best for you.</i>

199
00:19:18,705 --> 00:19:23,410
<i>Avoid shopping
on an empty stomach.</i>

200
00:19:23,444 --> 00:19:26,647
<i>Try our warm, comforting meals
prepared especially for you</i>

201
00:19:26,681 --> 00:19:28,383
<i>in our store.</i>

202
00:19:57,478 --> 00:20:00,715
Visit our butcher section
and try our exceptionally

203
00:20:00,748 --> 00:20:02,384
fresh meat.

204
00:20:14,361 --> 00:20:16,030
Amanda?

205
00:20:16,063 --> 00:20:19,667
Sweetie? I'm home!

206
00:20:19,701 --> 00:20:23,038
I'm in the bath!

207
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:26,308
Hold on, I'm coming!

208
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,612
Huh? What the?

209
00:20:38,049 --> 00:20:38,686
Jaaaacques?

210
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,655
Yeah, I'm coming!

211
00:20:58,138 --> 00:20:59,974
Jaaaacques?

212
00:21:46,421 --> 00:21:48,623
The next step...

213
00:21:48,655 --> 00:21:51,626
Is to change the whole
damn climate here.

214
00:21:51,658 --> 00:21:54,661
We're working on it.

215
00:21:54,694 --> 00:21:57,366
Thanks.

216
00:22:03,805 --> 00:22:05,807
Next time... she's going
to get such a big tip,

217
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:08,443
she'll see which side
her bread's buttered on.

218
00:22:16,584 --> 00:22:18,086
Where is everybody?

219
00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:24,925
Get outta here! They're sick!

220
00:22:34,034 --> 00:22:37,037
Ruby! Ruby! Come see mama!

221
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:39,674
Oh who's a good girl...
Come here! Ah!!!!

222
00:22:50,717 --> 00:22:52,219
Oh shit!

223
00:22:59,493 --> 00:23:01,562
Ow fuckin' dog, get this
piece of shit off me!

224
00:23:03,231 --> 00:23:05,733
Arrrghh! Mother fucking
dog, get off of me!

225
00:23:07,801 --> 00:23:09,545
Stay right fucking there
you piece of fucking shit.

226
00:23:09,569 --> 00:23:11,673
Jesus h. Christ!

227
00:23:15,609 --> 00:23:18,213
They want to unionize or what?

228
00:23:52,946 --> 00:23:54,781
Nice one, mom... seriously...

229
00:23:54,815 --> 00:23:57,251
Give me a break. I'm here, okay!

230
00:23:57,284 --> 00:23:59,620
I can't cancel house
viewings just like that!

231
00:23:59,654 --> 00:24:01,655
Does it bug you that
much to miss school?

232
00:24:01,688 --> 00:24:03,557
Not at all...

233
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:06,994
Then, what's the problem?

234
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:09,530
- She's crying.
- I know!

235
00:24:09,563 --> 00:24:11,765
I can hear her.

236
00:24:24,645 --> 00:24:26,247
- Are you the one that called?
- Yes...

237
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:30,018
They're always noisy, but this
time... it sounds like they're

238
00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:33,120
going at it tooth and nail!

239
00:24:33,154 --> 00:24:35,990
Yeah... go back inside.
I'll deal with it!

240
00:24:36,022 --> 00:24:38,025
Thank you.

241
00:25:00,615 --> 00:25:02,150
Hello?

242
00:25:13,327 --> 00:25:15,997
You okay?

243
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:28,342
Whoa...

244
00:25:28,376 --> 00:25:36,376
Whoa... whoa... whoa!!!

245
00:25:41,254 --> 00:25:43,223
What the hell?

246
00:25:46,726 --> 00:25:49,963
Badge 122 to dispatch!

247
00:25:49,996 --> 00:25:52,633
Hello?

248
00:25:52,666 --> 00:25:56,404
Hello?

249
00:26:00,941 --> 00:26:03,310
<i>Hey, leave me a message.</i>

250
00:26:03,344 --> 00:26:06,314
<i>Pat? It's me.</i>

251
00:26:06,347 --> 00:26:09,017
<i>Something weird's going on!</i>

252
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:11,085
<i>I've got a bad feeling,
I'm gonna go get the truck</i>

253
00:26:11,117 --> 00:26:13,154
<i>and pick you up, okay?</i>

254
00:26:13,186 --> 00:26:16,357
<i>Call me as soon as you can!</i>

255
00:26:16,389 --> 00:26:20,395
<i>There are people on the street
who seem... pretty bad!</i>

256
00:26:36,176 --> 00:26:39,446
Sweet pea, stop putting
everything in your mouth!

257
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,450
It's normal, she's teething.

258
00:26:42,482 --> 00:26:45,386
Oh look who's an
expert paediatrician!

259
00:26:45,418 --> 00:26:47,320
Among other things...

260
00:26:47,354 --> 00:26:49,223
Honey?

261
00:26:49,255 --> 00:26:51,224
Can you prep a bottle
for your sister, please!

262
00:26:51,258 --> 00:26:53,861
Aw mom, come on, I've
taken care of her enough today.

263
00:26:53,894 --> 00:26:56,396
Make the bottle yourself!

264
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:59,834
Oh you better change that tone
mister, and just do as I ask.

265
00:27:05,473 --> 00:27:08,309
No, use bottled water. How many
times do I have to tell you?

266
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:33,367
Babies are pretty
tough, you know.

267
00:27:33,399 --> 00:27:36,069
They don't need
to exercise every day to be

268
00:27:36,103 --> 00:27:38,840
healthy... unlike you, ma.

269
00:27:38,873 --> 00:27:40,808
I'm eliminating toxins.

270
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:44,011
Yeah but, it's a drag 'cause
I read that stress increases

271
00:27:44,043 --> 00:27:46,813
your level of toxins.

272
00:27:46,847 --> 00:27:49,751
Maybe you should
be relaxing instead

273
00:27:49,783 --> 00:27:56,123
of exercising and taking
anti-depressants, right?

274
00:27:56,156 --> 00:27:59,460
He thinks he's so
smart with his smartphone.

275
00:27:59,492 --> 00:28:02,396
Huh?

276
00:28:08,802 --> 00:28:10,838
Ah...

277
00:28:18,011 --> 00:28:20,815
- Coke: One and
Kale juice: Zero.

278
00:29:11,098 --> 00:29:14,135
Um... mom, did you
overdose on Kale?

279
00:29:19,572 --> 00:29:24,011
Hey... mom... eat something,
you're hypoglycaemic!

280
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:28,348
Come on pat... pick up! Pick up!

281
00:29:28,382 --> 00:29:31,018
I'll give you clonazepam, okay?

282
00:29:32,049 --> 00:29:33,295
Serax? Rivortril? Valium?
Ativan? Xanax?

283
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:35,956
A big steak? Aaarrg!

284
00:29:40,426 --> 00:29:44,531
<i>Hey, leave me a message.</i>

285
00:29:44,565 --> 00:29:48,936
Oh shit!

286
00:29:48,969 --> 00:29:51,138
That's my mother!

287
00:29:51,171 --> 00:29:53,274
Don't touch her!

288
00:29:53,307 --> 00:29:56,043
Mom?

289
00:29:56,076 --> 00:29:58,112
What's wrong with her?

290
00:29:58,145 --> 00:29:59,579
I dunno, but she's
not the only one.

291
00:29:59,613 --> 00:30:01,482
Well, call an ambulance.

292
00:30:01,514 --> 00:30:03,416
9-1-I just hangs up in my face.

293
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:05,586
Go home, lock your doors
and stay hidden.

294
00:30:24,038 --> 00:30:25,940
Are they zombies?

295
00:30:25,973 --> 00:30:27,407
Never seen a zombie
with green eyes.

296
00:30:27,441 --> 00:30:29,410
- You've seen a zombie before?
- Yeah, sure!

297
00:30:29,443 --> 00:30:31,444
Really?

298
00:30:31,478 --> 00:30:33,248
On TV.

299
00:30:37,251 --> 00:30:40,387
Um... boss, we can't
enter the island.

300
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:42,990
10 - 4. What's
the situation over there?

301
00:30:43,022 --> 00:30:44,457
It's a little hard to explain.

302
00:31:10,384 --> 00:31:13,320
<i>You have reached 9-1-1,
this is a recorded message.</i>

303
00:31:13,354 --> 00:31:16,424
<i>Peacock island is under
quarantine. Stay at home,</i>

304
00:31:16,456 --> 00:31:19,459
<i>lock all doors and windows
and avoid all outside contact.</i>

305
00:31:32,239 --> 00:31:34,008
Mom, stop!

306
00:31:42,281 --> 00:31:44,018
Mom, calm down, okay?

307
00:31:58,232 --> 00:32:00,468
No Annie, stop crying, shhh!

308
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,269
Time to go night-night.

309
00:32:02,301 --> 00:32:04,137
Shhhh!!!

310
00:32:35,601 --> 00:32:40,206
Dad... what's happening?
They're everywhere.

311
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,044
<i>I'm coming pat,
just keep hiding!</i>

312
00:32:43,077 --> 00:32:45,279
I'm scared!

313
00:32:45,311 --> 00:32:47,714
<i>I know, pat, it's okay,
don't worry. I'm on my way.</i>

314
00:32:47,748 --> 00:32:49,583
<i>Where are you?</i>

315
00:32:49,616 --> 00:32:52,020
- I'm in the cart garage.
- <i>It's okay, I'm almost there.</i>

316
00:33:12,371 --> 00:33:14,274
Pat! Get outta my way, lady!

317
00:33:35,428 --> 00:33:37,363
What were you doing outside?

318
00:34:20,673 --> 00:34:23,677
Shhh!!!

319
00:35:06,385 --> 00:35:10,423
My god!

320
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:56,737
<i>We had to do something
to isolate the problem.</i>

321
00:35:56,769 --> 00:35:59,339
<i>That's done.
Full quarantine is now in place.</i>

322
00:35:59,372 --> 00:36:02,742
<i>Let me assure all of you,
the situation is under control.</i>

323
00:36:13,419 --> 00:36:18,459
It's gonna be okay, Annie.

324
00:36:18,492 --> 00:36:21,662
Ya hungry?

325
00:36:47,019 --> 00:36:48,921
Annie!

326
00:36:48,955 --> 00:36:50,658
Here!

327
00:36:55,696 --> 00:36:57,498
You don't want your bottle?

328
00:37:32,031 --> 00:37:34,468
Ga!

329
00:37:36,937 --> 00:37:39,373
Hey! Hey, hey mom! Mom!

330
00:37:39,406 --> 00:37:41,942
Here... mom, come here!

331
00:37:46,446 --> 00:37:51,352
- Annie! Stay there!
- Ga!

332
00:37:58,457 --> 00:38:00,026
Annie, I said, stay
in the bathroom!

333
00:39:58,845 --> 00:40:00,814
Meow!!!

334
00:40:51,097 --> 00:40:52,966
Did you have to bring
all of them with you?

335
00:40:56,002 --> 00:40:58,105
This is a fucking nightmare!

336
00:40:58,138 --> 00:40:59,773
You?

337
00:40:59,805 --> 00:41:01,841
You ran over my mother.

338
00:41:01,874 --> 00:41:04,310
And you're the one
watching videos on your bike.

339
00:41:04,343 --> 00:41:07,613
Whatever...

340
00:41:07,647 --> 00:41:10,284
I need to make up a bottle.

341
00:41:10,316 --> 00:41:12,952
Well, there's a lot
of food here!

342
00:41:12,986 --> 00:41:15,022
Where's the formula?

343
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:17,257
I wouldn't know, look around...

344
00:41:17,289 --> 00:41:20,059
Must be here somewhere.

345
00:41:20,093 --> 00:41:23,030
- How long have you been here?
- Since yesterday.

346
00:41:23,062 --> 00:41:24,897
So, what's the plan?

347
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:26,899
What plan?

348
00:41:26,932 --> 00:41:28,868
Well, we can't just stay here!

349
00:41:28,901 --> 00:41:31,338
We can't cross the river,
all the boats have been

350
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:33,839
put in storage.

351
00:41:33,872 --> 00:41:36,242
You could always swim,
but it's a bit cold.

352
00:41:39,946 --> 00:41:43,017
Yeah, well I need to get
some food for my sister.

353
00:42:26,825 --> 00:42:29,295
Annie!

354
00:42:29,328 --> 00:42:31,365
What are you doing?

355
00:42:39,738 --> 00:42:41,874
It's okay, pat!

356
00:42:41,908 --> 00:42:43,277
Calm down.

357
00:42:46,011 --> 00:42:48,182
It's Patricia...

358
00:42:51,417 --> 00:42:53,319
She's my daughter.

359
00:42:53,352 --> 00:42:57,790
Your daughter? She's infected.

360
00:43:00,193 --> 00:43:02,028
She'll get better.

361
00:43:55,948 --> 00:43:59,418
<i>M prefers to keep their
business practices confidential.</i>

362
00:43:59,452 --> 00:44:02,022
<i>Discretion is a

<i>standard operating procedure.</i>

<i>Experts are on their way

365
00:44:06,292 --> 00:44:08,962
<i>it is crucial that everyone

366

<i>the protocol, to ensure

367
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:12,466
<i>of our activities.</i>

368
00:44:12,499 --> 00:44:15,202
Do what you have to do,
just get me out of here!

369
00:44:15,234 --> 00:44:17,803
<i>We've implemented our
own emergency protocol.</i>

370
00:44:22,008 --> 00:44:24,910
The "protocol" is simple;
I just gave it to you!

371
00:44:24,943 --> 00:44:28,114
<i>Stand down! Operation
clean-up is underway.</i>

372
00:44:39,459 --> 00:44:41,761
Come on!

373
00:44:41,794 --> 00:44:43,763
Come on!

374
00:44:46,165 --> 00:44:48,100
Come on!!

375
00:44:48,133 --> 00:44:51,403
Come on! Come on!
Let's go! Come on!

376
00:44:51,437 --> 00:44:55,075
Okay, come on! Come on!

377
00:45:01,847 --> 00:45:04,116
There won't always be gas...

378
00:45:04,149 --> 00:45:05,985
But, it helps.

379
00:45:06,019 --> 00:45:07,787
You can't always rely
on modern comforts.

380
00:45:22,435 --> 00:45:24,905
<i>Let's be serious
for a minute, okay?</i>

381
00:45:24,937 --> 00:45:28,575
<i>We know that it's some kinda
virus, and we know it's viral.</i>

382
00:45:28,607 --> 00:45:31,410
<i>What we don't know is
how it's transmitted!</i>

383
00:45:31,443 --> 00:45:33,379
<i>Is it in the air? In the water?</i>

384
00:45:33,412 --> 00:45:35,281
<i>Up in the clouds?</i>

385
00:45:35,314 --> 00:45:39,019
<i>Did they all eat tainted
caviar, for god's sake!</i>

386
00:45:39,051 --> 00:45:42,454
<i>I'm telling you, there's
something fishy going on!</i>

387
00:45:42,488 --> 00:45:45,425
<i>Anyway, let's take some calls.
Patrick nault is listening.</i>

388
00:45:45,457 --> 00:45:47,293
<i>Yes, hello, I just
wanted to say, I think</i>

389
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:50,062
<i>it's another attack by
those goddamn eco-terrorists.</i>

390
00:45:50,095 --> 00:45:52,031
<i>- What a moron!
- They love setting up</i>

391
00:45:52,064 --> 00:45:54,934
<i>roadblocks on Bridges, well
now, they're blowing them up!</i>

392
00:45:54,968 --> 00:45:57,904
<i>Okay, lose him.
Daniel beauregard.</i>

393
00:45:57,937 --> 00:46:00,973
<i>Yeah uh, well thanks
for the call, there.</i>

394
00:46:01,006 --> 00:46:04,077
<i>We have Daniel beauregard,
the minister of public security</i>

395
00:46:04,109 --> 00:46:06,111
<i>on the line.</i>

396
00:46:06,144 --> 00:46:09,048
<i>Mister beauregard, who is
responsible, here?</i>

397
00:46:09,082 --> 00:46:12,018
<i>We're not there yet.
We'll launch an inquiry.</i>

398
00:46:12,051 --> 00:46:14,254
<i>We need to find the cause
of all this before we start</i>

399
00:46:14,287 --> 00:46:16,455
<i>disrupting the status quo.</i>

400
00:46:16,488 --> 00:46:19,059
<i>The status quo is a death
sentence, minister beauregard.</i>

401
00:46:19,091 --> 00:46:21,961
<i>If you would please just
answer the question honestly.</i>

402
00:46:21,995 --> 00:46:23,406
<i>This is not the
time for double-talk.</i>

403
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:25,341
<i>I'm just saying that we want
to find the cause before...</i>

404
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:28,868
<i>What are the chances
of survival for those infected?</i>

405
00:46:28,901 --> 00:46:30,612
<i>I think it's better to talk
about the catastrophe</i>

406
00:46:30,636 --> 00:46:33,272
<i>we just averted. We've got
to look at the positive side.</i>

407
00:46:33,305 --> 00:46:36,075
<i>Ha ha! The positive?</i>

408
00:46:36,109 --> 00:46:38,044
<i>If we know nothing,
we do nothing. That's</i>

409
00:46:38,077 --> 00:46:41,113
<i>our policy, it's why the
people voted us into office.</i>

410
00:46:41,147 --> 00:46:43,884
<i>- Thank you.
- That was Daniel beauregard,</i>

411
00:46:43,917 --> 00:46:48,421
<i>minister of public security,
another incompetent fool.</i>

412
00:46:48,453 --> 00:46:51,423
<i>You don't need a diploma
to figure this one out.</i>

413
00:46:51,457 --> 00:46:55,962
<i>When an arm has gangrene,
you cut it off. And now,</i>

414
00:46:55,995 --> 00:46:57,464
<i>a message from our sponsors,</i>

415
00:46:57,497 --> 00:46:59,132
<i>we'll take more
calls after that.</i>

416
00:47:02,068 --> 00:47:03,669
What's wrong?

417
00:47:03,702 --> 00:47:05,971

<i>Say goodbye to weeds and fungi

424
00:47:24,957 --> 00:47:28,060
Is it true what that guy said?

425
00:47:28,093 --> 00:47:30,597
They're ready to sacrifice
us to protect themselves?

426
00:47:33,598 --> 00:47:36,202
They're scared.

427
00:47:36,234 --> 00:47:38,003
They're afraid of us!

428
00:47:38,037 --> 00:47:39,673
But you and I aren't
even infected!

429

Um, hi Patrick!
I listen to you every day.

431
00:48:03,129 --> 00:48:05,966
You have good taste, sir!

432
00:48:05,999 --> 00:48:07,701
<i>I'm calling from the island.</i>

433
00:48:07,734 --> 00:48:09,669
<i>I saw it all.</i>

434
00:48:09,702 --> 00:48:12,571
<i>But I'm not infected. I'm here
with three kids, and I'm sure</i>

435
00:48:12,604 --> 00:48:15,708
there are others who aren't
infected, who want to leave.

436
00:48:15,742 --> 00:48:18,644
- We need your help to...
- <i>Um... what's your name?</i>

437
00:48:18,678 --> 00:48:22,248
Dan... Dan gingras.

438
00:48:22,281 --> 00:48:24,050
<i>Listen to me, Dan, okay.</i>

439
00:48:24,082 --> 00:48:29,421
<i>I... I want to help, but you've
gotta help me help you.</i>

440
00:48:29,455 --> 00:48:33,727
You, say you're not infected,
but how can you be sure?

441
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,694
Look, Patrick, I know
I'm not infected, Christ,

442
00:48:35,727 --> 00:48:38,164
my daughter's in a
fridge and she's green!

443
00:48:38,196 --> 00:48:40,432
I'm sorry about
your daughter, Dan.

444
00:48:40,466 --> 00:48:43,636
How many of you
survivors are there?

445
00:48:43,669 --> 00:48:47,073
<i>There are three of us here,
but I'm sure there are others</i>

we really need help!</i>

447
00:48:51,109 --> 00:48:54,580
<i>Dan, listen to me, Dan.
It's important.</i>

448
00:48:54,613 --> 00:48:58,484
Do you know what exactly is
happening on that island?

449
00:48:58,517 --> 00:49:04,490
<i>Because I don't, and that
makes me very nervous.</i>

450
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:06,659
Know what I'm saying?

451
00:49:06,691 --> 00:49:08,627
<i>Nobody's listening to us!</i>

452
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:11,463
When we call 9-1-1,
they hang up for fuck's sake!

453
00:49:11,497 --> 00:49:14,501
Dan, ya gotta understand,
we don't want your germs.

454
00:49:14,533 --> 00:49:17,069
We've got to be damn sure of
what's going on over there

455
00:49:17,102 --> 00:49:19,171
before we send in the army?

456
00:49:19,205 --> 00:49:22,409
We're the victims here,
we're not the bad guys!

457
00:49:22,441 --> 00:49:24,644
That's not what you just said.

458
00:49:24,676 --> 00:49:27,347
You told me your daughter
was green, Dan...

459
00:49:27,379 --> 00:49:30,349
What the hell are we gonna
do with her... Dan?

460
00:49:38,156 --> 00:49:40,559
We can't just stay here.
We've gotta do something.

461
00:49:40,593 --> 00:49:43,696
- They'll...
- They'll what?

462
00:49:43,729 --> 00:49:45,698
They'll treat us as
if we're infected too.

463
00:49:51,203 --> 00:49:53,439
Come on, Annie! Try it.

464
00:49:53,472 --> 00:49:55,508
Mom liked this too.

465
00:50:01,481 --> 00:50:04,617
Annie.

466
00:50:04,649 --> 00:50:06,485
Here.

467
00:50:24,769 --> 00:50:27,807
Look at you!
You're eating, sweet pea!

468
00:50:30,408 --> 00:50:33,312
Patricia also liked yogurt.

469
00:50:35,214 --> 00:50:37,484
Thanks...

470
00:50:40,419 --> 00:50:43,323
Well, now what do we do?

471
00:50:43,356 --> 00:50:45,290
We'll take care of ourselves.

472
00:50:45,323 --> 00:50:47,693
Me and pat, we'll
hide in the woods.

473
00:50:47,727 --> 00:50:49,896
I've been preparing
for this for a while.

474
00:50:49,928 --> 00:50:51,764
You can join us, if you want.

475
00:50:56,368 --> 00:50:58,338
No...

476
00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:00,539
We've gotta find
what's causing this.

477
00:51:00,573 --> 00:51:03,710
You want pat to be cured, right?

478
00:51:03,743 --> 00:51:05,812
We've gotta find a vaccine...

479
00:51:07,847 --> 00:51:10,517
To make a vaccine, you've
gotta find the cause!

480
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:12,752
Guess so.

481
00:51:21,627 --> 00:51:23,296
It's the water!

482
00:51:23,328 --> 00:51:25,698
Huh?

483
00:51:25,731 --> 00:51:29,169
The only thing that'll infect
everyone at the same time!

484
00:51:29,202 --> 00:51:31,738
It's true, I never drink water.

485
00:51:31,771 --> 00:51:35,341
What if it was
poisoned by terrorists?

486
00:51:35,374 --> 00:51:38,678
Easy to get into the water
plant, there's no security.

487
00:51:38,711 --> 00:51:40,946
Huh, terrorists? On our island?

488
00:51:40,979 --> 00:51:43,482
Well... it makes sense.

489
00:51:45,417 --> 00:51:46,852
What's so funny?

490
00:51:46,885 --> 00:51:48,887
I don't know... terrorists.

491
00:51:48,921 --> 00:51:50,857
Well, it's not funny!

492
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:55,194
Even Annie thinks it's funny!

493
00:51:55,227 --> 00:51:58,264
Well, it's not.

494
00:53:05,298 --> 00:53:06,799
Shhhh quiet!

495
00:53:06,832 --> 00:53:09,402
Calm down! Shhhhhh!!!!

496
00:53:31,589 --> 00:53:33,459
Why didn't you kill her?

497
00:53:33,492 --> 00:53:35,662
Because she's
someone's daughter.

498
00:53:38,930 --> 00:53:40,999
How old is this crate anyway?

499
00:53:41,033 --> 00:53:43,435
There's no power socket!

500
00:53:43,468 --> 00:53:45,604
To do what?

501
00:53:45,638 --> 00:53:47,707
I dunno, I could charge my cell!

502
00:53:49,975 --> 00:53:52,511
Here, take mine.

503
00:54:04,055 --> 00:54:06,295
Who did you want to call? Do you
have family around here?

504
00:54:08,693 --> 00:54:11,797
No... no ones left.

505
00:54:16,368 --> 00:54:17,970
Sorry...

506
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:59,578
<i>We're back with another caller.
Camilla Sanchez, go ahead.</i>

507
00:54:59,611 --> 00:55:01,947
<i>Do you realize
what you're doing?</i>

508
00:55:01,981 --> 00:55:03,850
What is it I'm doing?

509
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:05,185
You're calling for murder!

510
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:09,555
<i>Um, ha ha... no, excuse me,
but I am not calling for murder.</i>

511
00:55:09,588 --> 00:55:12,892
Just listen to me:
At this moment in time,

512
00:55:12,925 --> 00:55:14,469
there're a couple thousand
people who are infected

513
00:55:14,493 --> 00:55:16,662
on an island. Okay?

514
00:55:16,694 --> 00:55:21,167
It's serious, it's
sad, it's distressing.

515
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,903
But we can still
limit the damage.

516
00:55:23,935 --> 00:55:26,905
That's where I'm working, sir.
There are nice people there.

517
00:55:26,939 --> 00:55:28,783
Before we condemn them all,
why not save the ones

518
00:55:28,807 --> 00:55:30,876
who aren't ill?

519
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:35,615
Madam, I find that
very noble, a great idea,

520
00:55:35,647 --> 00:55:38,517
it's very generous,
full of good intentions.

521
00:55:38,551 --> 00:55:41,087
But if this thing
continues to spread,

522
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,556
then millions of people
will be in danger,

523
00:55:43,589 --> 00:55:46,125
<i>hundreds of millions, maybe
the entire population</i>

524
00:55:46,158 --> 00:55:50,062
<i>of the planet. Is that
really what you want?</i>

525
00:55:50,095 --> 00:55:53,800
A few thousand people or
everyone else in the world?

526
00:55:53,832 --> 00:55:55,968
Would you actually choose that
couple of thousand

527
00:55:56,001 --> 00:56:00,106
on peacock island, come on.
By the way, listening to you,

528
00:56:00,138 --> 00:56:02,974
<i>I'm detecting a slight accent,
you're not a quebecer, are you?</i>

529
00:56:03,008 --> 00:56:06,078
You sound like you're
Latin-American?

530
00:56:06,111 --> 00:56:07,814
I am a quebecer.

531
00:56:07,847 --> 00:56:10,816
Yeah, yeah, I know, quebecer
but originally latino...

532
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:12,452
<i>Didn't your ancestors
perform sacrifices?</i>

533
00:56:12,484 --> 00:56:14,486
<i>I'm sure they did!</i>

534
00:56:14,519 --> 00:56:17,522
- Pardon?
- <i>Human sacrifices?</i>

535
00:56:17,555 --> 00:56:19,825
Like the Mayans,
they sacrificed humans

536
00:56:19,859 --> 00:56:21,694
to feed their god.
And the aztecs offered

537
00:56:21,727 --> 00:56:24,163
a human heart to their god
tezcatlipoca to ward

538
00:56:24,196 --> 00:56:26,232
<i>off cataclysms.</i>

539
00:56:26,265 --> 00:56:28,734
<i>I mean, the incas sacrificed
their children</i>

540
00:56:28,767 --> 00:56:30,111
when the emperor was sick.
Children under eight,

541
00:56:30,135 --> 00:56:32,104
I'll have you know!

542
00:56:32,136 --> 00:56:36,175
So, don't come here and lecture
us on morals. Okay?

543
00:56:36,207 --> 00:56:38,944
Let's hear some music
now why don't we.

544
00:56:38,977 --> 00:56:40,613
Hey! I am a quebecer!

545
00:56:40,646 --> 00:56:42,214
She's gone!

546
00:56:42,247 --> 00:56:45,818
Cretino!

547
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:48,186
Wow! That was awesome!
You're great! I love you!

548
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:50,555
You're the best!
You're the best!

549
00:56:50,589 --> 00:56:52,725
That's what I call radio,
my dear!

550
00:57:34,732 --> 00:57:37,135
I guess you're the "protocol"
that they sent.

551
00:57:40,872 --> 00:57:43,642
I've burned all the
documents, the contracts.

552
00:57:43,676 --> 00:57:45,912
You should get rid of
the rest of the fertilizer

553
00:57:45,944 --> 00:57:48,713
and change the grass back.

554
00:57:48,747 --> 00:57:50,617
Do you have the... uh...

555
00:58:11,236 --> 00:58:13,705
This, will kill the molecule
within twenty-four hours.

556
00:58:13,738 --> 00:58:17,208
Everywhere. In the water,
the grass, in...

557
00:58:17,242 --> 00:58:20,747
Ah! Ah!

558
00:58:27,852 --> 00:58:30,289
Grass...

559
00:58:33,225 --> 00:58:35,328
Beautiful, green grass...

560
00:58:35,361 --> 00:58:37,229
Who the...

561
00:58:37,261 --> 00:58:39,865
No!

562
00:59:16,068 --> 00:59:20,238
We can't take the little one,
if she cries, we won't be safe!

563
00:59:22,441 --> 00:59:24,010
What about her?

564
00:59:28,946 --> 00:59:30,716
We can't leave her
with the baby.

565
01:00:21,432 --> 01:00:23,301
Patricia! Come back!

566
01:00:25,903 --> 01:00:27,906
Pat!

567
01:00:27,939 --> 01:00:29,307
Come here, pat!

568
01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:36,014
Patricia!

569
01:00:36,048 --> 01:00:38,383
Ah man...

570
01:00:38,417 --> 01:00:39,886
It smells worse
than a dirty diaper!

571
01:00:43,421 --> 01:00:45,190
Shit!

572
01:00:45,223 --> 01:00:48,059
They sure love their water!

573
01:00:48,093 --> 01:00:49,896
Son of a bitch!

574
01:00:56,935 --> 01:01:00,106
Uh... I'll just wait here, okay?

575
01:01:00,138 --> 01:01:02,107
Pat... pat!

576
01:01:32,470 --> 01:01:34,106
They don't bite each other!

577
01:01:36,575 --> 01:01:38,477
Ah shit!

578
01:01:38,510 --> 01:01:40,345
- Run!
- I'm running!

579
01:01:40,379 --> 01:01:42,982
- Go on! Run!
- Don't worry, I am!

580
01:02:06,571 --> 01:02:08,439
Come on.

581
01:02:08,472 --> 01:02:10,275
That's enough! Come on!

582
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:11,944
Hey! Come here!

583
01:02:16,582 --> 01:02:20,586
Come on, pat, I'm fed up...

584
01:02:20,618 --> 01:02:22,821
I've had it with this shit!

585
01:02:26,357 --> 01:02:27,357
Fucking shit!

586
01:03:29,988 --> 01:03:31,524
What the...

587
01:03:34,493 --> 01:03:38,063
It just broke off...

588
01:03:38,095 --> 01:03:40,899
like a dead branch!

589
01:03:47,339 --> 01:03:49,508
Stay here.

590
01:04:01,285 --> 01:04:02,725
Do you know your
daughter's password?

591
01:04:05,723 --> 01:04:08,126
Dan?

592
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:09,928
Dan?

593
01:04:11,696 --> 01:04:13,633
What's wrong?

594
01:04:22,573 --> 01:04:25,912
Yes! Ha ha! It worked!

595
01:04:35,653 --> 01:04:37,489
What the fuck are you doing?

596
01:04:59,644 --> 01:05:01,613
Weird, there's grass growing...

597
01:05:03,281 --> 01:05:05,318
Grass?

598
01:05:11,256 --> 01:05:13,292
Grass in the winter!

599
01:05:13,325 --> 01:05:16,694
Okay, so what does that mean?

600
01:05:16,727 --> 01:05:21,066
It's not terrorists!
It's the golfers!

601
01:06:47,419 --> 01:06:49,099
- Okay, let's go.
- Yeah, yeah, I'm coming.

602
01:06:51,388 --> 01:06:53,158
- Hurry up, let's go!
- Yeah, yeah...

603
01:07:00,531 --> 01:07:03,801
Hello?!

604
01:07:03,834 --> 01:07:05,803
Open up! We're not infected!

605
01:07:05,836 --> 01:07:09,107
Except one!

606
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:11,176
Hey, they'll understand.

607
01:07:24,455 --> 01:07:26,091
Watch her. I'll be right back.

608
01:08:22,413 --> 01:08:23,781
Over here!

609
01:08:38,596 --> 01:08:40,241
I looked up grass that gives
off smoke on the net

610
01:08:40,265 --> 01:08:41,900
but I didn't find anything.

611
01:08:41,932 --> 01:08:43,635
Put the damn phone away!

612
01:08:43,668 --> 01:08:45,404
This is where it's happening!

613
01:09:01,753 --> 01:09:04,390
It's just 'til
we find a cure, pat.

614
01:09:06,790 --> 01:09:08,526
You're too fragile.

615
01:09:37,588 --> 01:09:39,624
Annie, I'll be right back.

616
01:09:39,658 --> 01:09:41,427
I need to help Dan.

617
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:58,610
What are we looking for?

618
01:09:58,642 --> 01:10:01,012
Something... I don't know,
something that makes grass grow

619
01:10:01,046 --> 01:10:04,516
in the winter, melts snow
and gives off smoke.

620
01:10:08,485 --> 01:10:10,788
- Ah shit!
- What's wrong?

621
01:10:10,821 --> 01:10:12,958
I left my flashlight
at the water plant.

622
01:10:18,529 --> 01:10:20,331
What did I tell you?

623
01:10:58,403 --> 01:11:00,338
What the heck is that?

624
01:11:00,372 --> 01:11:04,476
- It's still breathing.
- It's a dog.

625
01:11:04,508 --> 01:11:06,811
Looks like it turned into grass.

626
01:11:06,845 --> 01:11:08,847
We've got no time to lose.

627
01:11:08,879 --> 01:11:10,848
Pat's not gonna
end up like that!

628
01:11:22,092 --> 01:11:23,729
Keep her quiet, I'll keep going.

629
01:11:23,762 --> 01:11:25,664
Yeah...

630
01:11:27,431 --> 01:11:29,434
- André!
- Yeah?

631
01:11:29,467 --> 01:11:31,403
Where's the button
for the light?

632
01:11:31,436 --> 01:11:33,505
Oh...

633
01:11:41,512 --> 01:11:42,948
Thanks.

634
01:11:44,949 --> 01:11:48,620
Ah Dan? The arm...

635
01:11:54,993 --> 01:11:57,129
Here.

636
01:12:01,766 --> 01:12:03,735
André?

637
01:12:03,767 --> 01:12:08,006
- Yeah?
- Be careful.

638
01:12:08,038 --> 01:12:10,508
You too.

639
01:12:24,122 --> 01:12:26,825
Annie?

640
01:12:30,794 --> 01:12:32,163
Aw fuck!

641
01:12:35,867 --> 01:12:37,802
Annie?

642
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:51,183
Bastards!!

643
01:13:08,266 --> 01:13:11,803
Nooooo!

644
01:13:45,302 --> 01:13:48,172
Annie? Annie? Where are you?

645
01:14:44,995 --> 01:14:47,632
Annie?

646
01:14:47,664 --> 01:14:49,635
Annie? Where are you?

647
01:14:52,971 --> 01:14:54,806
Annie?

648
01:15:48,126 --> 01:15:51,997
Here...

649
01:15:52,029 --> 01:15:55,199
Eat.

650
01:15:55,232 --> 01:15:57,202
Candy.

651
01:15:57,235 --> 01:15:58,903
So good...

652
01:16:04,007 --> 01:16:05,876
Annie?

653
01:16:19,123 --> 01:16:20,892
Ah! Sweet pea!!!!

654
01:16:20,925 --> 01:16:24,128
I was so worried.

655
01:16:24,162 --> 01:16:26,330
Never do that again, okay?

656
01:16:41,079 --> 01:16:43,849
Who are you?

657
01:16:56,194 --> 01:16:58,830
If you touch my sister I'll...

658
01:16:58,863 --> 01:17:01,800
I swear, I'll...

659
01:17:10,408 --> 01:17:12,910
I hate babies!

660
01:20:04,649 --> 01:20:08,887
Uh... hello, my name is
andré boisbriand.

661
01:20:08,919 --> 01:20:12,457
I'm on peacock island
and I'm not infected.

662
01:20:17,328 --> 01:20:19,464
The infected are attracted
to water and sunlight...

663
01:20:19,497 --> 01:20:23,101
And water. It seems like they've
been genetically modified,

664
01:20:23,133 --> 01:20:26,136
so that grass grows on them.

665
01:20:26,169 --> 01:20:30,374
This is my sister...

666
01:20:30,408 --> 01:20:33,244
She's green. I understand
why you've had

667
01:20:33,276 --> 01:20:36,047
to quarantine us, but...

668
01:20:36,079 --> 01:20:37,599
She's gonna look like this
pretty soon.

669
01:20:42,386 --> 01:20:44,656
I need some help, please.

670
01:20:48,124 --> 01:20:52,162
The mortality rate for those
infected stands at 100 %.

671
01:20:52,195 --> 01:20:55,432
That's way more than
the ebola virus, minister.

672
01:20:55,466 --> 01:20:58,303
100 %! If you're infected,
you're dead!

673
01:20:58,336 --> 01:21:00,637
- 10000 infected, 10000 dead!
- Yes!

674
01:21:00,671 --> 01:21:03,040
Well I don't think our numbers
are the same.

675
01:21:03,074 --> 01:21:05,643
Bullshit! My numbers are
bang on and you know that,

676
01:21:05,676 --> 01:21:07,544
mister minister
of public insecurity!

677
01:21:07,578 --> 01:21:10,415
I'm gonna ask you a question,
but I'm warning you: It's

678
01:21:10,448 --> 01:21:13,517
- a hell of an important one!
- <i>Go ahead, I'm listening.</i>

679
01:21:13,551 --> 01:21:17,989
What are you going to do
to protect the population

680
01:21:18,021 --> 01:21:20,390
from an infection that's
a 100 % virulent?

681
01:21:20,423 --> 01:21:22,961
- One hundred percent!
- What we want to do is...

682
01:21:22,994 --> 01:21:27,098
When a limb has gangrene, the
only way, the only way, to save

683
01:21:27,131 --> 01:21:30,001
- the patient is amputation!
- Amputation?

684
01:21:30,034 --> 01:21:32,403
You take a saw and
you cut off what's rotten.

685
01:21:32,436 --> 01:21:34,706
Are you ready
to take out the saw,

686
01:21:34,739 --> 01:21:40,044
mister minister? Are you
ready to save Quebec?

687
01:21:44,714 --> 01:21:46,650
<i>Approaching landing pad.</i>

688
01:22:11,742 --> 01:22:15,713
Hey!

689
01:22:34,798 --> 01:22:36,300
Help me!! Help me!!!

690
01:23:21,311 --> 01:23:24,414
Easy now, easy.
I'm not infected!

691
01:23:24,448 --> 01:23:25,717
It's going to be okay, pat.

692
01:23:43,833 --> 01:23:47,370
<i>War is war.</i>

693
01:23:47,404 --> 01:23:51,342
<i>We don't live in a fairy-tale
land of unicorns and rainbows.</i>

694
01:23:51,374 --> 01:23:53,578
<i>We're being threatened.
We're in danger.</i>

695
01:23:55,546 --> 01:23:59,684
<i>The self-righteous assholes put
us in danger by welcoming</i>

696
01:23:59,717 --> 01:24:02,187
those who would destroy us.

697
01:24:04,555 --> 01:24:07,191
<i>You want to protect your
way of life, your culture,</i>

698
01:24:07,223 --> 01:24:10,261
<i>your world...</i>

699
01:24:10,293 --> 01:24:12,796
<i>It's either us... or them!</i>

700
01:24:17,935 --> 01:24:20,405
Hey!

701
01:24:23,673 --> 01:24:26,610
<i>All right, the minister says
the epidemic has been contained.</i>

702
01:24:26,644 --> 01:24:28,779
- André!
- Hey!

703
01:24:28,811 --> 01:24:30,747
<i>Those idiots finally got
it through their heads.</i>

704
01:24:30,780 --> 01:24:32,716
André!

705
01:24:32,749 --> 01:24:35,352
Ah... ga...

706
01:24:35,386 --> 01:24:37,722
<i>Sometimes you have to point
them in the right direction!</i>

707
01:24:37,754 --> 01:24:42,292
After the traffic report
and an update on sports,

708
01:24:42,325 --> 01:24:45,930
we'll hand the mic over
to our buddy Richard and

709
01:24:45,962 --> 01:24:48,665
his talk show. We're, uh...
Gonna head back home

710
01:24:48,699 --> 01:24:51,235
for some well-deserved r and r.

711
01:24:51,267 --> 01:24:55,172
You're listening to 95.8
the city's number one station

712
01:24:55,205 --> 01:24:58,642
with Patrick nault.
Have a good one.

713
01:25:04,714 --> 01:25:08,218
Annie! You are safe,
my little angel.

714
01:25:10,753 --> 01:25:13,290
Are you okay?

715
01:25:16,659 --> 01:25:20,197
<i>People of Quebec, we have just
experienced an unprecedented</i>

716
01:25:20,230 --> 01:25:23,667
<i>event in our history and
except for the unfortunate</i>

717
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:28,271
<i>inhabitants of peacock island,
we got through it unscathed.</i>

718
01:25:28,305 --> 01:25:32,409
<i>We managed to contain
the epidemic, stop the breakout</i>

719
01:25:32,443 --> 01:25:36,580
<i>of contamination and eliminate
every last trace of infection.</i>

720
01:25:38,815 --> 01:25:41,551
<i>The perfect coordination
by the police force,</i>

721
01:25:41,584 --> 01:25:46,489
<i>the army and the private
sector, makes us all very proud.</i>

722
01:25:46,522 --> 01:25:50,328
<i>This protocol will be followed
from this day forward,</i>

723
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:52,395
<i>here and around the world.</i>

724
01:25:52,428 --> 01:25:53,765
<i>Excuse me.</i>

725
01:26:00,671 --> 01:26:04,941
<i>Quebecers, I just want to let
you know we can now celebrate</i>

726
01:26:04,975 --> 01:26:07,312
<i>and sleep easier tonight.</i>
