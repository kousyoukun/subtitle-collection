1
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,040
.

2
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,440
BELL RINGS

3
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,720
- 30 seconds to air, everybody! 
- Wow!

4
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,360
It takes 26,000 years for light to reach us

5
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,440
from the centre of the Milky Way.

6
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,840
Yes, but what about Professor McCork?

7
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,560
Is he ever going to reach us?

8
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,080
He'll make it, Colin. He always makes it.

9
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,760
WHIRRING Whoa...!

10
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,960
Ow!

11
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,000
Oh, crumpets! The boss is going to be very angry.

12
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,400
Argh!

13
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,720
Oh, lads, you're not going to believe what I just saw.

14
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,600
Positions, everyone, we're going live!

15
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,040
This is Brain Freeze.

16
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,520
With Dr Knowles...

17
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,840
..Professor McCork...

18
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,200
and Colin, the...floor manager.

19
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,280
Stand by!

20
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,120
Hello, everyone, and welcome to Brain Freeze.

21
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,560
And let's reveal...

22
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,360
Today we're asking, do aliens exist?

23
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,080
And, luckily, I've got the answer right here on my ph...

24
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,160
Hush, Professor, we're live!

25
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,880
Now, the universe is a really, really, really big place.

26
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,640
There are eight planets in our solar system,

27
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,400
- which orbit our nearest star, the sun. 
- Sure, we all know that.

28
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,800
The sun itself is one of 300 billion stars in our galaxy, the Milky Way.

29
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,720
Whoa, that IS a lot of stars.

30
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,320
And there are hundreds of billions of galaxies in the visible universe.

31
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,240
Hundreds of...billions...wha...? HE SIGHS

32
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,280
Actually, Professor, if you tried counting up every grain of sand

33
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,440
on every beach in the entire world,

34
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,280
it still wouldn't add up to the amount of stars in the universe.

35
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,800
Professor? Professor!

36
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,440
Ahem. Before we talk aliens, I think we need to take a break.

37
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,520
- BELL RINGS 
- And we're clear!

38
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,160
- Are you all right, McCork? 
- Aye, I'm grand, it's just a bump.

39
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,040
Hey, do you want to see a video I took of an alien?

40
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,520
Alien?!

41
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,920
You've seen an alien?

42
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,840
Here, take a look at this.

43
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,040
# La la la, da ba ba

44
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,840
# Ba ba ba, diddley-oh, hey! #

45
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,240
Oh, no, no, that's not the one. Hang on.

46
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,760
HE WHISTLES

47
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,280
Agh, that's not the one either.

48
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,080
Hang on, Colin, I'll get it. BELL RINGS

49
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,400
Oh, hurry up, McCork! We could get in big trouble.

50
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,120
- HEADSET WHINES 
- Oh! Yes, boss.

51
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,480
Absolutely, yeah. Right away. And we're back!

52
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,680
I must have been dreaming it all up.

53
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,680
There's no such thing as aliens.

54
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,080
Kelly just got in touch to ask, "But are we really alone?"

55
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,400
Course we're not alone.

56
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,120
Colin's over there, look.

57
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,160
Huh? Ohh...

58
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,240
Let's look at how alien life could exist.

59
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,680
Humans survive on Earth because of a few basic ingredients. These are...

60
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,880
liquid water,

61
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,880
some key elements like hydrogen, oxygen and carbon,

62
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,880
a source of energy, the moon's pull on the ocean tides,

63
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,560
and an environment which keeps us warm and shields us from danger.

64
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,360
So, what you're saying is, we're just really lucky?

65
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,360
Well, possibly, but remember the scale of the universe?

66
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,480
You mean the grains of sand on the beach bit?

67
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,400
- Yes. 
- Urgh... 
- Everything all right, there, Professor?

68
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,560
I'm fine! I'm OK. Carry on.

69
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,240
Well, there's a good chance other worlds like ours exist,

70
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,480
we just have no proof they actually support life... Yet.

71
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,520
Yeah, but what are we going to do about it?

72
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,800
Well, Professor, we've got huge telescopes like Hubble scanning

73
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,040
the stars and sending us back detailed images of the universe.

74
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,080
Meanwhile, the twin Voyager spacecrafts

75
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,440
explore the outer reaches of our solar system and beyond.

76
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,880
So, although no evidence of extraterrestrial life exists...

77
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,000
- The search is definitely on. 
- See you next time, folks.

78
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,520
And...we're...clear!

79
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,600
- Great show, everybody. 
- Right, so. No rest for the wicked.

80
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,320
I'm off out to buy a telescope.

81
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,800
Good luck, lads. See you later.

82
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,440
But, McCork...you forgot your phone!

83
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,040
'Wahey!'

84
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,760
Come on, faster, faster!

85
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,040
This is way better than my car at home. Can't do anything like this.

86
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,120
- 'Faster, faster!' 
- Dr Knowles...

87
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,160
I think there's something you should see.

88
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,400
'Can I drive?'
