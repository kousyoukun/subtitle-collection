00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:07,480
- BELL RINGS 
- All ready to go, Dr Knowles. 
- Colin! Do not move!

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,080
- There's a bee on your shoulder! 
- I know there is. 
- Huh?

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,440
Dr Knowles, meet Eric, my specially trained, super-intelligent

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,240
award-winning bumblebee.

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,120
Aah! I don't like bees! Take him away!

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,120
There's nothing to be scared of, Dr Knowles.

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,200
As long as we remain calm and don't make any sudden movements,

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,039
Eric will... Aaah!

10
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:32,280
Hey, everyone, look what I just found out the back.

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,920
- AIR HORN BLARES 
- Eric, come back!

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,680
This is Brain Freeze!

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,320
With Dr Knowles...

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,320
Prof McCork...

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,039
and Colin, the floor manager.

16
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,120
Stand by!

17
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,280
Hi, everyone, and welcome to Brain Freeze.

18
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,280
It's time for...

19
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,319
Today we're asking...

20
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:12,599
There are approximately 20,000 types of bee in the world.

21
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:16,599
This include honey bees, bumblebees, carpenter bees, leafcutter bees.

22
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:19,520
And they're all just horrible bugs that go around stinging people

23
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,760
- for no reason. 
- Not true, Professor.

24
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,959
Believe it or not, if it wasn't for bees,

25
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:28,040
- many of our favourite fruits and vegetables wouldn't exist. 
- You what?

26
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,760
Bees like the honey bee are one of nature's most important pollinators.

27
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,800
They collect nectar and pollen from flowers to feed their hives,

28
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,560
while at the same time transferring pollen from one plant to another.

29
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,760
And they make honey as well.

30
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,720
Oh, lovely, sweet, sticky honey.

31
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,920
Honey bees are highly social creatures living in large

32
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,680
- well-organised hives, which revolve around the queen. 
- Typical.

33
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,720
They even have their own means of communication called a waggle dance

34
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,360
which allows them to share directions to good food sources.

35
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,920
# Take me to the biscuits Let's eat some more ice cream... #

36
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,920
I think it's time for a break.

37
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,319
And we are clear.

38
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,520
Dr Knowles! Dr Knowles! Come and see the new trick I've taught Eric.

39
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,919
I'm not sure, Colin. What if he decides he wants to sting me?

40
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,400
Oh, nonsense. He's the friendliest bee I've ever kept.

41
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,720
Watch this.

42
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,319
He shoots! He scores!

43
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,479
- What the...? 
- Wait for it.

44
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,479
That's incredible!

45
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:32,479
Oh! That's so cute!

46
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,919
Thanks, Eric.

47
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,599
Hey, lads, how's it going?

48
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,960
Aaah! A bee!

49
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,319
Positions, everyone!

50
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:44,360
So Pat just got in touch saying, "What about the sting?

51
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,240
- "Is it true the bee dies?" 
- Looks like it's time for...

52
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,800
Oh, he's very loud, that fella.

53
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,400
Now, female honey bees and bumblebees can and will sting,

54
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,280
but only if they feel threatened.

55
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,560
However, a honey bee has barbs on its stinger,

56
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,360
whereas a bumblebee does not.

57
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,280
So when a honey bee stings, its barbs get stuck

58
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,479
and its insides are pulled apart as it tries to escape.

59
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,479
Oh! That's awful!

60
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:12,280
But a bumblebee's stinger has no barbs,

61
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,800
so when it stings it can escape unharmed.

62
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,919
Yeah, I know which one I'd prefer to BEE...

63
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:19,400
Ha-ha! Do you get it, Doctor?

64
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,560
Which I'd prefer to BEE! Ha-ha-ha!

65
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,400
Yeah, Professor, I heard you. Hilarious.

66
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,800
See you next time, folks, and remember to BEE careful out there.

67
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,440
Ha-ha-ha! BEE careful!

68
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,360
And we're clear!

69
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,479
- Colin, did you manage to find Eric again? 
- Ah, yes.

70
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:40,840
I used an old beekeeper's trick.

71
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,680
There he is! Aww!

72
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,400
- I don't know what I was so scared of. Bees are the best. 
- Told you, Doctor.

73
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,080
Lads, has anyone seen my...

74
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,000
Aah! A bee! He's back! Run!

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,440
Oh, Eric.

76
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,000
I wish McCork was as easy to train as you. Subtitles End: mo.dbxdb.com
