"Roses are red, violets are blue,

"you're my favourite guinea pig,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
"I hope I'm yours, too. Love, Doris."

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Oh, Colin,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
a Valentine's card from an old flame!

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Oh, it's so exciting!

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yes, and we're going out for a surprise dinner tonight.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Ooh, that's so romantic.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I LOVE surprises... Wah!

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Hey, lads - I've just invented a new perfume.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's called Stinky Mist.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
COLIN CHOKES

Positions, everyone!

This is Brain Freeze!

With Dr Knowles...

..Professor McCork

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and...Colin the floor manager.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Stand by!

# Brain freeze! #

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Hello, everyone and welcome to Brain Freeze.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's time to reveal...

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And today, we're asking what happens

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
when we fall in love?

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Well, Dr Knowles, I happen to be

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
an expert in matters of the heart.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Actually, Professor,

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
we don't love with our hearts, we love with our brains.

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You wha...?

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
When we fall in love, a chemical called dopamine

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
floods the part of our brain that processes pleasure.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This gives us such a rush that it makes us literally crave

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
the other person.

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
However, we also experience a spike

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
in a hormone called adrenaline,

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and this has some... Shall we say, noticeable physical effects.

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Your mouth dries out, your heart starts to race,

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
your palms get all sweaty...

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
'Tis fierce embarrassing, really.

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It can be, Professor.

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But before we go on, we need to take a short break.

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And we are clear!

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So, Colin. What have you got planned for later?

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Well, I think classic is the way to go, Doctor - flowers, chocolates,

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
a nice meal, some music. Maybe poetry...

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Whoa! Slow down, Colin.

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Don't forget to relax and be yourself too.

48
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
HE SIGHS

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You're right, Doctor - just be myself.

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What could possibly go wrong?

JAZZY LOUNGE MUSIC

52
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
CRASH!

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Crumpets.

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Hey, Colin...

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Did I mention that my perfume has secret powers?

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
HE CHOKES

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Oh, McCork, get away from me!

58
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Places, everyone!

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This just in from Rosalind. Is it true that love is blind?

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Well, some studies have shown that love does suppress

61
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
the part of our brain

62
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
which judges how nice people really are.

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And if the person you love doesn't love you back, it can cause stress,

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
disturb your sleep and put you in a real bad mood.

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So why do we bother with love at all?

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Well, love can go either way.

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Let's say the other person DOES like you

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and you show each other affection.

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The cuddle hormone, oxytocin,

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
is gradually released in your brain, giving you a warm,

71
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
fuzzy feeling that helps with trust and bonding.

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's enough to make you sick, isn't it?

73
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Anyway, I think it's time to wrap this one up.

74
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So, as you've seen, we understand a little bit about what

75
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
happens in our brains when we fall in love.

76
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But the old romantic in me knows that there's something

77
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
a little bit more mysterious to it than that.

78
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's true, science can't explain everything

79
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and we're still not entirely sure

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
why we really fall for the people we do.

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
But the important thing is to have fun and not to overthink it.

82
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
See you next time, folks!

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And that's a wrap! Wow, look at you, Colin.

84
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Nothing is going to stop me now.

85
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Wish me luck, everybody!

86
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Just a little top-up before you go, Colin.

87
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
No, stop it, McCork!

88
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I told you, it has special powers.

89
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I love you, McCork.

90
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
What the...?!

91
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I love you, McCork. Go away.

92
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Get back! I love you... Get off me! I love you.

93
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Go away, will you? Get off!

94
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I guess it must be true after all -

95
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
love IS blind!

96
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
