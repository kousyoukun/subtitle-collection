1
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,040
.

2
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,400
Dr Knowles, Dr Knowles, you've got to help me.

3
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,400
I've been invited to the annual beekeepers' ball tonight.

4
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,280
Ooh! That's exciting, Colin.

5
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,080
I know it is, but I can't go looking like this.

6
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,920
Hmm... Well, your look is a little... vintage.

7
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,200
- BANG 
- Hey, lads, look what I got.

8
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,400
A total makeover kit, 100% satisfaction guaranteed.

9
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,560
Who wants to be on my guinea pig? Huh?

10
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,800
Oh, I think I know where this is headed.

11
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,080
This is Brain Freeze.

12
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,560
With Dr Knowles...

13
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,880
Professor McCourt...

14
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,080
And Colin, the floor manager.

15
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,640
Stand-by!

16
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,160
Hello again and welcome to Brain Freeze.

17
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,720
It's time for...

18
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,720
Today's question is...

19
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,200
Well, first things first, all mammals have hair,

20
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,840
and the primary function of hair is to keep us warm.

21
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,200
Even before we are born, we have a layer of fine, downy hair

22
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,600
which prevents body heat from escaping.

23
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,920
Yeah, that'd explain all the hairy babies in our family.

24
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,400
Now, there are two other types of hair.

25
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,800
The very fine colourless hair found on most of our bodies

26
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,720
and the thicker, longer, darker hair that grows on our heads.

27
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,160
So we're pretty much covered all over in some kind of hair?

28
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,320
That's right. In fact, there are only a few places where hair doesn't grow.

29
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,200
These include your lips, the palms of your hands

30
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,680
and the soles of your feet.

31
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,320
That's proof enough for me. Basically we're monkeys.

32
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,280
- Ooh-ooh! 
- Well, speak for yourself, Professor! 
- Ooh-ooh-ah!

33
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,120
We'll be right back after this break.

34
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,600
And we are clear!

35
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,160
OK, Colin, take a deep breath and prepare to be transformed.

36
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,600
Oh, crumpets! I don't like this.

37
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,480
Meet Colin, he's a floor manager from the Midlands

38
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,600
with the fashion sense of a sausage.

39
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,400
We need to freshen up his dated look and make him feel like 1 million.

40
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,400
Work it, Colin. Own it!

41
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,160
Yeah, baby. That's the look.

42
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,200
Oh, stop it! This is all wrong.

43
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,240
- BELL 
- Positions!

44
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,880
Welcome back. Lynn got in touch to ask

45
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,720
"So what is hair exactly and how does it work?"

46
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,440
Our skin contains over 5 million tiny openings called hair follicles.

47
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
Inside these follicles, hair cells work together

48
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,800
to produce the hard protein, keratin,

49
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,480
which forms the hair shaft that grows out from the root.

50
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,680
Oh, don't talk to me about roots!

51
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,680
The root is the living part of the hair

52
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,680
and it's connected to blood vessels,

53
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,240
nerve endings and other glands

54
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,360
that help it function.

55
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,120
Well, we all need a little help from time to time.

56
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,720
But by the time the hair has reached the skin surface,

57
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,840
it's made up entirely of dead cells.

58
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,960
Which leads us conveniently to...

59
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,000
So, Dr Knowles, why doesn't a haircut hurt?

60
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,640
What the...? Well, the answer is quite simple.

61
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,680
There are no nerve endings in the dead part of our hair,

62
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,600
so we don't feel anything when it's cut.

63
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,600
But it does hurt if we pull hair

64
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,480
because we're pulling out all the little nerves inside the roots.

65
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,520
- See you next time on Brain Freeze! 
- Toodle-oo.

66
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,040
- Hey! Where's Colin? 
- I'm in here, Dr Knowles!

67
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,080
I'm just putting the finishing touches to my new look.

68
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:32,200
- Ooh, let's see, let's see! 
- Very well. Prepare to be amazed!

69
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,320
But... Em... What happened to... ?

70
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,360
I decided, Dr Knowles, that I'm happy just the way I am.

71
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,560
You know what, Colin, you're right.

72
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,200
Well, perhaps just a hint of styling cream.

73
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,320
Beekeepers' ball, here I come!

74
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,080
Oh, honestly, Dr Knowles.

75
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,160
Some people just don't know style when they see it.

76
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,160
Argh!

77
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,200
# Brain Freeze! #
