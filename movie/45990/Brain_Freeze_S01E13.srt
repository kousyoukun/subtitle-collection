1
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,240
Isn't it fantastic, Doctor?

2
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,840
Your brilliance has finally been recognised

3
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,840
at the Rising Star Science Awards.

4
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,120
Oh, come on, Colin. It's just a tacky award ceremony.

5
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,960
Scientists pretending to be celebrities. Cheap laughs.

6
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,520
But what's wrong with cheap laughs, Doctor?

7
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,080
Hey, lads.

8
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,640
I've booked a huge stretch limo to drop us at the red carpet later.

9
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,520
- It's going to be brilliant. 
- Oh, not you as well.

10
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,320
You can cancel that limo, Professor. I'm not going.

11
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,640
What? But...

12
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,160
BELL RINGS

13
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,640
Positions, everybody!

14
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,680
This is Brain Freeze! With...

15
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,960
..the floor manager.

16
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,920
Stand by!

17
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,920
Hello, everybody, and welcome to Brain Freeze.

18
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,200
It's time for...

19
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,720
Today we're asking...

20
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,000
Our sun is a star, similar to other stars in the universe,

21
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,240
and it constantly produces energy.

22
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,560
How does it do that?

23
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,440
Well, the sun's core is like a really enormous oven,

24
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,160
heated to over 15 million degrees Celsius.

25
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,200
At the centre of this oven, hydrogen comes under huge pressure

26
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,080
and fuses to form helium,

27
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,280
creating massive amounts of energy in the process.

28
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,760
We call this nuclear fusion.

29
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,840
Total confusion, if you ask me.

30
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,760
Anyway, we'll be right back after these.

31
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,640
And we are clear!

32
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,720
So, Dr Knowles, do you have your acceptance speech ready?

33
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,720
I already told you, I'm not going.

34
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,520
Ah, you have to go. The Science Awards are the stuff of legend.

35
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,280
The glitz and the glamour, the fancy seats,

36
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,840
all the lollipops you can eat.

37
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,400
Professor, I became a scientist to explore new horizons,

38
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,320
to change the world.

39
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,200
But...they've got 42 different flavours.

40
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,040
Oh! Well, I've got a science show to finish.

41
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,400
BELL RINGS Oh, crumpets!

42
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,120
We're back in five, four...

43
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,280
- Welcome back. 
- The sun began life about 4.6 billion years ago

44
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,120
and is currently about halfway through its life cycle.

45
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,880
How on earth do we know that?

46
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,560
From observing the life cycle of other stars,

47
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,520
scientists predict that in about five billion years' time,

48
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,000
the sun will expand greatly and become a red giant.

49
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,240
After this it will continue to release energy

50
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,800
by using up all its remaining fuel,

51
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,360
until finally only the inner core is left,

52
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,720
at which point it is known as a white dwarf.

53
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,240
Giants and dwarves - that's my kind of science.

54
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,840
Dr Knowles, when is the sun going to stop shining?

55
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,720
We can't say for certain, but we think the sun's life cycle

56
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,560
will end in about 6.5 billion years' time.

57
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,560
But what will happen to us?

58
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,960
The earth will have ceased to be inhabitable long before that.

59
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,720
But I've got a feeling us scientists

60
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,720
will have figured something out by then.

61
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,000
PROFESSOR FARTS

62
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,920
- Oh, sorry about that. 
- Professor!

63
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,160
See you next time!

64
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:16,560
- And we're clear! Hurry up, everybody, the limo is here! 
- What?!

65
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,600
Ah, come on, Dr Knowles, there's no way we're leaving you behind.

66
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,400
Oh, this is the worst day of my life.

67
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,080
APPLAUSE

68
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,560
Oh, this is the best day of my life!

69
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,200
I want to thank my family, and my old science teacher,

70
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,160
and my fantastic colleagues at Brain Freeze.

71
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,080
- Hello, everybody! 
- Hello.

72
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,840
Oh, I just love science so much!

73
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,400
She's getting into it now, all right. See? I told you.

74
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:48,080
Such a beautiful heart. Perfectly matched to her beautiful mind.

75
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,000
What are you on about?

76
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,360
Here, have another lollipop.
