1
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:57,040
.

2
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,040
BELL RINGS

3
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:08,040
According to this, we've mapped more of the surface of Mars than

4
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,200
the bottom of the Earth's oceans. Isn't that amazing?

5
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,360
That is fascinating, Dr Knowles.

6
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,840
Er, what's going on, Colin? You seem VERY relaxed.

7
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,120
It's part of my new healthy regime.

8
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,840
No more stress for me, no matter what stunt McCork pulls.

9
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,680
Sorry I'm late, Colin.

10
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,760
My car broke down and my dog got sick and I fell in a hole...

11
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,840
Not to worry, McCork. Take your place when you're ready.

12
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,600
We're going live shortly.

13
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,120
What's up with your man?

14
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,120
This is Brain Freeze...

15
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,800
with Dr Knowles...

16
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,160
Professor McCork...

17
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,520
and Colin the floor manager.

18
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,760
Stand by!

19
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,120
Hi and welcome to Brain Freeze.

20
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,680
It's time to reveal...

21
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,760
Today we ask...

22
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,600
How deep is the ocean? That's a Justin Bieber song, isn't it?

23
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,480
The deep sea is the lowest layer of the ocean

24
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,320
and includes anything below 200 metres

25
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,440
right down to over ten kilometres.

26
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,000
And the deep sea is one of the largest habitats

27
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,400
for living creatures on the planet. That's a fact.

28
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,320
Now, since the 1960s, scientists have discovered some incredible creatures

29
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,480
that have adapted to the darkness and high pressure of the deep sea.

30
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,760
Creatures.

31
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,240
What kind of creatures?

32
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,840
There's the flashlight fish and the angler fish,

33
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,160
who have evolved their own system of lighting...

34
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,240
FISH ROARS, HE SCREAMS

35
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,680
The fangtooth fish, which has been found at depths near 5,000 metres

36
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,800
and has the largest teeth of any fish relative to its size.

37
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,840
Amazing. I wonder if he'd be tasty with a bag of chips.

38
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,120
HE SCREAMS

39
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,160
And these sea cucumbers, also known as sea pigs.

40
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,480
Well, they're just really well-adapted

41
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,720
to living under pressure.

42
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,160
Speaking of pigs under pressure, I'm off to see what Colin's doing.

43
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,280
But, Professor, we're live!

44
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,280
So unprofessional!

45
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,960
SHE CLEARS HER THROAT Back after this break.

46
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,960
Colin? Hey, Colin, Colin?

47
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,480
Ah, where's he gone?

48
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,880
Channel all negative thoughts outward

49
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,880
and embrace your inner butterfly.

50
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,200
Sorry, Colin. Just to let you know we're taking a break now, OK?

51
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,400
Ignoring all other distractions that may be present...

52
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,600
Oh, and, Colin, Dr Knowles was wondering

53
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,080
if you wanted anything down the shop.

54
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:43,240
..we are now in an unbreakable state of calm.

55
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,120
One last thing, Colin - did I show you my new pogo stick?

56
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,200
Oh, McCork, you've ruined it!

57
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,040
How am I supposed to relax when you keep interrupting me?!

58
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like it's got a life of its own!

59
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,800
Oh, crumpets! Get back to work, McCork.

60
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,080
We're going live.

61
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,120
Welcome back.

62
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,680
Megan just got in touch to say, "Will you please hurry up

63
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,960
"and tell us where the deepest part of the ocean is?"

64
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,600
That means it's time for...

65
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,480
At almost 11 kilometres deep,

66
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,160
the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean is the deepest known part.

67
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,720
- To be specific. 
- No, no, Pacific. 
- Yeah, I was being specific.

68
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,960
To give you an idea of how deep that is, this huge trench is

69
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,400
a full 2,000 metres deeper than Mount Everest is tall.

70
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,600
Tell me, Doctor,

71
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,960
how does the pressure change being down that deep?

72
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,360
Pressure in the ocean increases at about one atmosphere for every

73
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,720
ten metres of depth.

74
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,080
So the pressure at the bottom would be like trying to

75
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,040
carry around 50 jumbo jets.

76
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,840
Whoa! Now that's real pressure.

77
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,840
That's all for today, folks. See you next time on Brain Freeze.

78
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,440
Clear, and that's a wrap.

79
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,240
Yes, of course, boss. No dangerous equipment on set.

80
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,960
Yeah, including pogo sticks.

81
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,480
Ah, isn't it great to see him back to his old self again, Dr Knowles?

82
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,560
Yeah. I don't know what he'd do without you, Professor(!)

83
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,160
Hup! Anyway, I'm off home. See you later.
