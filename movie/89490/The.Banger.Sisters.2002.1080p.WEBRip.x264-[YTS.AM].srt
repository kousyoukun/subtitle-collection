1
00:01:33,064 --> 00:01:34,816
Freak out!

2
00:01:36,276 --> 00:01:38,320
All's fried! Dried! Cried!

3
00:01:41,281 --> 00:01:43,533
Yeah!

4
00:01:45,285 --> 00:01:47,037
Can you feel it?

5
00:01:59,132 --> 00:02:00,383
Hey!

6
00:02:02,135 --> 00:02:04,387
I'm telling you, girl,
the manager's gonna fire you.

7
00:02:04,471 --> 00:02:05,889
Hey, it's corporate mentality, Jay.

8
00:02:05,972 --> 00:02:07,516
Come on. He doesn't care
about the history...

9
00:02:07,641 --> 00:02:08,892
of this place.

10
00:02:08,975 --> 00:02:10,727
You called him
a cocksucker, Suzette.

11
00:02:10,811 --> 00:02:12,104
Did I say that?

12
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:14,147
Hey, I'm a garbage mouth, OK?

13
00:02:34,126 --> 00:02:36,628
Everybody!

14
00:02:36,795 --> 00:02:38,004
Come on up!

15
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,006
Oh, what are you doing?

16
00:02:40,132 --> 00:02:42,008
Don't let him
see you drinking.

17
00:02:50,142 --> 00:02:53,019
He's gunning
for you, Suzette.

18
00:02:53,145 --> 00:02:55,021
I've been drinking
rum and Coke...

19
00:02:55,147 --> 00:02:56,690
since before he was born.

20
00:02:56,815 --> 00:02:59,025
He can go fuck himself.

21
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:15,792
See that bathroom?

22
00:03:15,917 --> 00:03:18,462
Jim Morrison passed out
in there one night...

23
00:03:18,587 --> 00:03:20,464
with me underneath him.

24
00:03:20,589 --> 00:03:23,967
Jim Morrison is a ghost,
and so are you.

25
00:03:24,092 --> 00:03:25,469
Oh, come on, Matt.

26
00:03:25,594 --> 00:03:27,137
I can't not work here.

27
00:03:27,262 --> 00:03:29,139
You might as well shoot me.

28
00:03:29,264 --> 00:03:31,808
You know,
I just got my car fixed...

29
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:34,644
I owe rent, I owe money
all over the place.

30
00:03:36,104 --> 00:03:37,481
Come on. Hey.

31
00:03:37,606 --> 00:03:38,982
Come on, seriously.

32
00:03:39,107 --> 00:03:40,650
I'm fun. People love me.

33
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,820
I'm a spirit
around here, man.

34
00:03:43,945 --> 00:03:45,655
You don't want to lose me.

35
00:03:45,781 --> 00:03:47,157
I'm Suzette!

36
00:03:47,282 --> 00:03:49,493
Well, Suzette,
we'll just have to see...

37
00:03:49,618 --> 00:03:51,828
if the club can survive
without you.

38
00:04:00,253 --> 00:04:01,546
Shit!

39
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:49,553
What you doing?

40
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,238
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

41
00:05:08,363 --> 00:05:11,658
6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

42
00:06:22,312 --> 00:06:23,563
Oh!

43
00:06:35,492 --> 00:06:36,701
Vinnie.

44
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,751
Vinnie.

45
00:07:35,302 --> 00:07:36,636
Whoops.

46
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,816
Oh!

47
00:07:53,945 --> 00:07:56,698
There's something wrong
with this pump.

48
00:07:56,782 --> 00:07:58,658
No, the pump is fine.

49
00:07:58,784 --> 00:08:00,452
You have to pay cash.

50
00:08:00,577 --> 00:08:01,787
Oh! Come on, man.

51
00:08:01,912 --> 00:08:03,747
I don't have any cash, OK?

52
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,123
And that machine is broken.

53
00:08:05,248 --> 00:08:06,917
Don't you have one
of those thingies?

54
00:08:07,042 --> 00:08:10,128
You know,
those swipey thingies?

55
00:08:11,588 --> 00:08:12,631
Oh!

56
00:08:21,973 --> 00:08:23,558
Disgusting!

57
00:08:26,144 --> 00:08:27,437
Disgusting!

58
00:08:27,562 --> 00:08:29,981
And there is
no excuse for it.

59
00:08:30,107 --> 00:08:33,693
Landed on the back
of my hand and copulated...

60
00:08:33,819 --> 00:08:35,195
2 flies!

61
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,947
On the back of my hand!

62
00:08:37,072 --> 00:08:39,533
It's a terrible,
terrible bus!

63
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,297
Hi. Excuse me.

64
00:08:54,423 --> 00:08:56,133
Hi.

65
00:08:56,258 --> 00:08:59,886
I just was wondering
if you could help me out.

66
00:09:00,011 --> 00:09:01,221
I'm kind of stranded.

67
00:09:01,346 --> 00:09:03,432
And if I could get a dollar
from each of you...

68
00:09:03,515 --> 00:09:05,225
a dollar
from each one of you...

69
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,185
would really be
helping me out. I...

70
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:10,147
Uh, well...

71
00:09:10,272 --> 00:09:11,773
I don't normally do this.

72
00:09:11,857 --> 00:09:13,316
Hi.

73
00:09:13,442 --> 00:09:15,986
OK. Well, all right.
Whatever you can do.

74
00:09:16,111 --> 00:09:18,655
50 cents, 25 cents.

75
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,323
You know, my car's
just sitting out there...

76
00:09:20,449 --> 00:09:21,658
I'm out of gas...

77
00:09:21,783 --> 00:09:24,327
and I'm just trying
to get to Phoenix.

78
00:09:24,453 --> 00:09:25,829
Phoenix?

79
00:09:28,373 --> 00:09:29,583
I'll buy you a tank of gas...

80
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,334
if you give me a ride.

81
00:09:34,671 --> 00:09:38,884
First, one fly lands,
then a second fly goes zzzz.

82
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:40,385
I started freaking.

83
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:43,555
I mean,
they had sex on my skin.

84
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,724
Whoo,
I hope you get over it.

85
00:09:45,849 --> 00:09:47,225
I washed off the germs.

86
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,728
When I get to Phoenix,
I'll take a bath.

87
00:09:49,853 --> 00:09:52,230
But, you know,
what's it say about human beings?

88
00:09:52,355 --> 00:09:54,733
We do basically
the same thing flies do.

89
00:09:54,858 --> 00:09:57,569
Male fly gets on top
of the female fly...

90
00:09:57,694 --> 00:09:59,237
this... activity happens.

91
00:09:59,362 --> 00:10:01,782
The similarity is depressing.

92
00:10:01,907 --> 00:10:04,117
So, why are you
going to Phoenix?

93
00:10:04,242 --> 00:10:06,453
That I can't divulge.

94
00:10:06,578 --> 00:10:07,954
Oh, I see.

95
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,625
Well, are you allowed
to divulge your name?

96
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,585
Harry Plummer.

97
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,089
Are you a writer,
Harry Plummer?

98
00:10:17,214 --> 00:10:18,590
Is that an old typewriter...

99
00:10:18,715 --> 00:10:20,092
between your legs?

100
00:10:20,217 --> 00:10:22,427
Yes, it is,
and I am a writer...

101
00:10:22,552 --> 00:10:24,262
but I don't want to talk...

102
00:10:24,387 --> 00:10:26,098
about why I'm going
to Phoenix.

103
00:10:26,223 --> 00:10:27,933
Then quit bringing it up.

104
00:10:30,852 --> 00:10:32,896
Why are you going
to Phoenix?

105
00:10:34,523 --> 00:10:35,732
To go see a friend.

106
00:10:35,857 --> 00:10:37,234
She's married
to some rich guy there.

107
00:10:37,359 --> 00:10:38,568
He's a lawyer
or something.

108
00:10:38,693 --> 00:10:39,736
I'm gonna ask her...

109
00:10:39,861 --> 00:10:41,113
if I can borrow some money.

110
00:10:41,238 --> 00:10:42,697
That's a very bad idea.

111
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:44,032
Why? What is?

112
00:10:44,116 --> 00:10:45,700
To show up unannounced,
ask her for money.

113
00:10:45,784 --> 00:10:47,035
She'll be offended.

114
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:48,537
She used
to be my best friend.

115
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,871
Used to be? When?

116
00:10:49,955 --> 00:10:51,373
You went to high school
together?

117
00:10:51,456 --> 00:10:53,250
Hey, I don't like you
trying to figure me out. OK?

118
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,919
And by the way,
you've got it all wrong.

119
00:10:56,044 --> 00:10:57,504
We dropped out
of high school...

120
00:10:57,629 --> 00:11:00,340
we were roommates,
and we used to...

121
00:11:00,465 --> 00:11:03,343
Well, we were famous,
if you want to know.

122
00:11:03,468 --> 00:11:04,719
As what?

123
00:11:04,803 --> 00:11:06,263
We were groupies.

124
00:11:09,558 --> 00:11:10,934
If you played L. A...

125
00:11:11,059 --> 00:11:12,936
chances are,
we rattled you, babe.

126
00:11:13,061 --> 00:11:14,354
Rattled?

127
00:11:14,479 --> 00:11:17,190
Yeah.
What those flies did...

128
00:11:17,315 --> 00:11:19,568
on your little hand there.

129
00:11:19,651 --> 00:11:20,902
Like that.

130
00:11:20,986 --> 00:11:23,238
Ever hear of Frank Zappa?

131
00:11:23,321 --> 00:11:25,240
Sure.
The Mothers of Invention.

132
00:11:25,323 --> 00:11:27,075
Hey, very good, Harry.

133
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:28,785
Well, he named us.

134
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:31,580
The Banger Sisters.

135
00:11:37,836 --> 00:11:39,254
But you weren't
really sisters, though.

136
00:11:39,337 --> 00:11:40,422
No.

137
00:11:40,505 --> 00:11:41,715
Well, that's good.

138
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,049
I wouldn't
have been comfortable...

139
00:11:43,175 --> 00:11:44,384
if you were
actually sisters.

140
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:45,886
You're not
comfortable now, Harry.

141
00:11:46,011 --> 00:11:48,096
I'm fine. I'm just hot.

142
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,599
Yeah.
You look like an eskimo.

143
00:11:50,682 --> 00:11:53,769
And stop nosing
around in my shit, OK?

144
00:11:53,852 --> 00:11:56,772
When I show up
at her doorstep...

145
00:11:56,855 --> 00:11:58,774
she's gonna drop everything...

146
00:11:58,857 --> 00:12:00,776
because we're gonna party.

147
00:12:02,194 --> 00:12:06,782
Just sit there
and be a passenger.

148
00:12:11,036 --> 00:12:14,039
Oh, you're gonna look so beautiful.

149
00:12:14,164 --> 00:12:16,374
Why don't I just get
my whole head replaced...

150
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,710
because you've got a picture
of some person, Mom...

151
00:12:18,835 --> 00:12:20,212
and it isn't me.

152
00:12:20,337 --> 00:12:22,214
Hannah, you are going
to be so grateful...

153
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:23,715
that you listened to me.

154
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,218
I just want my normal hair.

155
00:12:26,343 --> 00:12:29,221
It's not a normal night,
sweetheart.

156
00:12:29,346 --> 00:12:30,722
You're resisting.

157
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,557
I'm not resisting. I'm...

158
00:12:32,682 --> 00:12:35,060
You're resisting everything
that I'm saying...

159
00:12:35,185 --> 00:12:38,063
and you are
making yourself unhappy.

160
00:12:38,188 --> 00:12:39,564
Now...

161
00:12:39,689 --> 00:12:42,234
shall we back-comb it
or tease it?

162
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:44,236
No. Not tease.
I'm begging you.

163
00:12:44,361 --> 00:12:46,238
I'd rather just cut it off.

164
00:12:46,363 --> 00:12:48,573
All right.
Then we'll back-comb it...

165
00:12:48,698 --> 00:12:50,575
and pin it and fold it...

166
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,577
and try a little French twist.

167
00:12:55,705 --> 00:12:57,582
Why does it have to go up?

168
00:12:57,707 --> 00:12:59,918
I don't understand
why that is a rule.

169
00:13:00,043 --> 00:13:01,586
So that people can admire...

170
00:13:01,711 --> 00:13:03,255
your earrings, sweetheart.

171
00:13:19,604 --> 00:13:20,814
I'm 50.

172
00:13:20,939 --> 00:13:22,315
Hey, this better be good...

173
00:13:22,441 --> 00:13:23,984
because you just fucked
with my music.

174
00:13:24,067 --> 00:13:25,986
I'm 50...

175
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:27,821
and I'm giving myself
a birthday present.

176
00:13:27,946 --> 00:13:29,322
I'll tell you what it is...

177
00:13:29,448 --> 00:13:31,825
but you have to promise
that you won't judge me.

178
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,326
You got to tell somebody...

179
00:13:33,452 --> 00:13:34,828
don't you, Harry?

180
00:13:36,163 --> 00:13:38,081
I grew up in Phoenix.

181
00:13:38,165 --> 00:13:40,876
I went to L.A.
to become a screenwriter.

182
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,586
At age 30,
I gave myself a deadline.

183
00:13:42,711 --> 00:13:44,087
I said,
"If I'm not successful...

184
00:13:44,212 --> 00:13:45,422
by the time I'm 50...

185
00:13:45,547 --> 00:13:47,048
then I'm coming back to Phoenix."

186
00:13:56,641 --> 00:13:59,019
I've never fired a gun in my life.

187
00:14:02,856 --> 00:14:05,108
It's only got one bullet in it.

188
00:14:05,192 --> 00:14:08,445
One bullet intended
for one specific person.

189
00:14:16,828 --> 00:14:18,038
And who would...

190
00:14:18,121 --> 00:14:19,956
that one specific person be,
Harry?

191
00:14:20,082 --> 00:14:21,625
My father.

192
00:14:23,251 --> 00:14:26,338
I'm going to Phoenix
to kill my father.

193
00:14:37,349 --> 00:14:38,892
Hey, pretty fancy.

194
00:14:39,017 --> 00:14:40,060
Ever write any movies...

195
00:14:40,143 --> 00:14:41,228
I might have seen, Harry?

196
00:14:41,353 --> 00:14:42,396
I'm not staying
in some dive...

197
00:14:42,521 --> 00:14:43,730
where you can hear
the ice machine.

198
00:14:43,855 --> 00:14:45,565
Oh, no. But you are a guy
who rides the bus.

199
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,067
That's what I don't get.

200
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,652
I don't drive, nor do I fly.

201
00:14:48,777 --> 00:14:49,986
Nor does he fly.

202
00:14:50,112 --> 00:14:52,155
Oh, you are a work of art, Harry.

203
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,324
You're gonna
check in there, take a bath...

204
00:14:54,449 --> 00:14:55,951
and go shoot your dad.

205
00:14:56,034 --> 00:14:57,869
Shh! The windows are open.

206
00:14:57,994 --> 00:15:01,248
You couldn't kill a fly, Harry.

207
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:05,919
I'm a person who,
when he has a goal...

208
00:15:06,044 --> 00:15:07,212
becomes very focused.

209
00:15:07,337 --> 00:15:09,714
You're not focused.
You're blurry.

210
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,924
I'm blurry?
What about you?

211
00:15:11,049 --> 00:15:12,592
I'm definitely blurry.
I didn't say I wasn't.

212
00:15:12,717 --> 00:15:13,844
You run out of gas...

213
00:15:13,927 --> 00:15:15,303
you panhandle,
you have tattoos.

214
00:15:15,387 --> 00:15:16,847
I said I was blurry, Harry.

215
00:15:16,972 --> 00:15:18,515
You're very blurry.
You're chaotic.

216
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,183
Your car is untidy,
and you smoke...

217
00:15:20,308 --> 00:15:21,351
and you went around...

218
00:15:21,476 --> 00:15:22,853
and had random sex
with people.

219
00:15:22,978 --> 00:15:24,855
Is that accurate to say?

220
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,022
I also don't wear underwear...

221
00:15:26,148 --> 00:15:27,149
Mr. Looney Tunes.

222
00:15:27,232 --> 00:15:29,860
Now, get out
of my untidy car.

223
00:15:29,985 --> 00:15:32,529
I can't get the door
to open.

224
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:38,118
Adios, killer.

225
00:16:16,114 --> 00:16:17,949
Hannah, sweetie, hurry up.

226
00:16:18,075 --> 00:16:19,451
Everybody's waiting.

227
00:16:19,576 --> 00:16:20,619
You look fabulous.

228
00:16:20,744 --> 00:16:21,953
Look at this.
Yeah. That's great.

229
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,121
Thank you, Dad.

230
00:16:23,246 --> 00:16:24,289
You look great.

231
00:16:24,414 --> 00:16:25,457
Thank you, Dad.

232
00:16:25,582 --> 00:16:26,833
Come on, sweetheart.

233
00:16:29,127 --> 00:16:30,212
That's it. Come on.

234
00:16:30,295 --> 00:16:31,755
That's your place
right here.

235
00:16:34,591 --> 00:16:36,468
Hurry up.

236
00:16:36,593 --> 00:16:39,304
Here we go, everybody.
Close together now.

237
00:16:39,429 --> 00:16:40,806
Back up.

238
00:16:40,931 --> 00:16:43,767
Back up. Back up.
Get together.

239
00:16:43,892 --> 00:16:46,061
Photo. Everybody.

240
00:16:46,144 --> 00:16:47,229
Hold it.

241
00:16:47,312 --> 00:16:48,563
Look this way, guys.

242
00:16:49,815 --> 00:16:50,899
OK. 1, 2...

243
00:16:53,068 --> 00:16:55,654
All right.
Come on now. Come on.

244
00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:57,406
Hurry up. Hurry up.

245
00:17:02,828 --> 00:17:04,037
Move in.

246
00:17:04,162 --> 00:17:05,372
Look this way, guys.

247
00:17:05,455 --> 00:17:06,998
OK. 1, 2, 3.

248
00:17:07,124 --> 00:17:08,333
Everybody this way.

249
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,669
Aw! All right.
In the car now.

250
00:17:10,794 --> 00:17:12,337
OK, come on.

251
00:17:12,462 --> 00:17:14,005
Hurry up. Hurry up.

252
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,510
Aw, that is so pretty.

253
00:17:18,635 --> 00:17:19,970
Mom!

254
00:17:20,095 --> 00:17:21,513
Over the shoulder...
I love that.

255
00:17:21,638 --> 00:17:23,014
All right, guys. Have fun.

256
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,516
Don't forget your corsage.

257
00:17:24,641 --> 00:17:26,017
Bye, Dad.

258
00:17:26,143 --> 00:17:27,602
Bye!

259
00:17:27,686 --> 00:17:29,020
Have fun!

260
00:17:29,146 --> 00:17:30,439
See you guys.

261
00:17:33,358 --> 00:17:34,609
Barkley! Barkley!

262
00:17:34,693 --> 00:17:36,445
She wants to go to the prom.

263
00:17:36,528 --> 00:17:38,530
There she goes.

264
00:17:38,655 --> 00:17:40,490
She looks so pretty.

265
00:17:40,615 --> 00:17:41,825
Aw, doesn't she?

266
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,744
Like a princess.

267
00:18:08,685 --> 00:18:10,896
Mr. Harry Plummer
is registered here.

268
00:18:11,021 --> 00:18:12,898
I'd like his room number,
please.

269
00:18:13,023 --> 00:18:14,357
Your name?

270
00:18:14,441 --> 00:18:15,734
Suzette.

271
00:18:21,114 --> 00:18:22,532
Yes. This is
the front desk...

272
00:18:22,616 --> 00:18:23,533
Mr. Plummer.

273
00:18:23,617 --> 00:18:24,868
There is a Suzette here...

274
00:18:24,993 --> 00:18:26,203
requesting your...

275
00:18:26,328 --> 00:18:28,538
Oh, what is this dance
we're doing?

276
00:18:28,663 --> 00:18:31,541
Harry? Yeah.
I need to talk to you.

277
00:18:33,126 --> 00:18:34,795
Because I just need to.

278
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,296
Because I just do.

279
00:18:36,379 --> 00:18:39,216
Hey, you want me
to tell the whole world...

280
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:40,717
what you're up to?

281
00:18:40,801 --> 00:18:42,886
What's your room number?
Cough it up.

282
00:18:43,011 --> 00:18:45,806
OK.

283
00:18:45,931 --> 00:18:47,307
Thank you.

284
00:18:51,103 --> 00:18:52,646
This is not appropriate.

285
00:18:52,729 --> 00:18:54,648
You're invading my space.

286
00:18:54,731 --> 00:18:56,817
I've created
my environment, Suzette.

287
00:18:56,942 --> 00:18:58,985
I'm gonna fuck you, Harry.

288
00:19:01,571 --> 00:19:03,115
OK.

289
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,825
Hey, what's the deal?

290
00:19:06,368 --> 00:19:10,038
Whoa, whoa. Are you in some kind
of cult or something?

291
00:19:10,122 --> 00:19:11,748
I'm calling security.

292
00:19:11,873 --> 00:19:14,626
Hey, and what would
George Harrison be doing here?

293
00:19:14,751 --> 00:19:16,211
Don't touch that.

294
00:19:16,294 --> 00:19:18,004
Don't touch anything.

295
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,548
This is horrible.

296
00:19:19,631 --> 00:19:21,550
Your eyes are looking
at everything.

297
00:19:21,633 --> 00:19:24,094
You need
to get laid, Harry.

298
00:19:26,138 --> 00:19:27,389
Please get out of my room.

299
00:19:27,472 --> 00:19:30,267
You need to get laid,
and I need to get laid...

300
00:19:30,392 --> 00:19:32,394
and I'm gonna have
a rum and Coke...

301
00:19:32,477 --> 00:19:34,020
then I'm gonna
take a shower...

302
00:19:34,146 --> 00:19:37,023
then I'm going to
you-know-what to you.

303
00:19:37,149 --> 00:19:38,775
Lookee here. Ha ha ha!

304
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,402
I don't want to have sex.

305
00:19:40,485 --> 00:19:41,820
I'll get you into it.

306
00:19:41,945 --> 00:19:43,864
No. You've already
desanctified...

307
00:19:43,989 --> 00:19:45,365
my environment.

308
00:19:45,449 --> 00:19:47,033
I'm just standing here.

309
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:48,368
No, you're not.

310
00:19:48,452 --> 00:19:51,204
You're more in the room
than I am.

311
00:19:53,331 --> 00:19:55,041
Listen, Suzette...

312
00:19:55,167 --> 00:19:57,919
I have a very carefully
delineated lifestyle.

313
00:19:58,003 --> 00:19:59,713
This is the third room
I've been in...

314
00:19:59,796 --> 00:20:01,047
since I got here.

315
00:20:01,173 --> 00:20:03,425
The first one
was too close to the elevator...

316
00:20:03,508 --> 00:20:05,135
the second one
was facing the neighborhood...

317
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,470
where I grew up.

318
00:20:06,595 --> 00:20:08,847
If I don't do things
in a regimented way...

319
00:20:08,972 --> 00:20:10,307
especially when I travel...

320
00:20:10,432 --> 00:20:12,100
I develop physical problems.

321
00:20:12,225 --> 00:20:13,977
I get terribly constipated...

322
00:20:14,102 --> 00:20:15,562
for instance.

323
00:20:15,645 --> 00:20:17,647
Like I needed to know that.

324
00:20:17,773 --> 00:20:19,483
Well,
there are certain things...

325
00:20:19,566 --> 00:20:21,902
I've discovered
that just don't serve me...

326
00:20:22,027 --> 00:20:23,153
and sex is one of them.

327
00:20:23,278 --> 00:20:24,321
You don't have sex?

328
00:20:24,446 --> 00:20:25,363
That's correct.

329
00:20:25,489 --> 00:20:26,740
How long has it been, Harry?

330
00:20:26,823 --> 00:20:28,116
10 years.

331
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,578
10 years!
You're lying to me!

332
00:20:31,661 --> 00:20:33,747
I found a way
of making my life work.

333
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:36,083
But it doesn't work.
I mean, you think it works...

334
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,417
because you line things up...

335
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:38,752
and you light candles...

336
00:20:38,835 --> 00:20:41,421
so you can
have a bowel movement?

337
00:20:41,505 --> 00:20:44,508
Harry,
let me give you a hand-job.

338
00:20:44,633 --> 00:20:46,343
- No!
- Oh, come on.

339
00:20:46,468 --> 00:20:49,262
Harry, I am such
a good hand-job giver.

340
00:20:49,387 --> 00:20:51,098
No. Please.
Stay away from me.

341
00:20:51,223 --> 00:20:52,933
I... I don't
do things suddenly.

342
00:20:53,058 --> 00:20:54,601
I like to think first...

343
00:20:54,684 --> 00:20:57,604
and you're too... too...

344
00:20:57,687 --> 00:20:59,106
Too what?

345
00:21:01,858 --> 00:21:03,276
Sudden.

346
00:21:06,238 --> 00:21:08,782
All right.
I'll leave you alone.

347
00:21:10,409 --> 00:21:12,494
But I got to sleep for a bit.

348
00:21:12,577 --> 00:21:14,538
Sleep where?

349
00:21:14,663 --> 00:21:16,581
In your environment.

350
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,378
What about your friend... Vinnie?

351
00:21:21,503 --> 00:21:23,922
Oh, I don't know
what I was thinking.

352
00:21:41,106 --> 00:21:42,399
You got enough vitamins,
Harry?

353
00:21:42,524 --> 00:21:44,901
It looks like
a health food store in here.

354
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:21,271
Hello. This is Harry Plummer
in 419 again.

355
00:22:21,396 --> 00:22:25,734
Is there any way I could move
to a room higher up?

356
00:22:25,817 --> 00:22:27,360
Nothing at all?

357
00:22:27,486 --> 00:22:30,697
Well, is there any way
you can stop this racket?

358
00:22:33,825 --> 00:22:35,827
Aah!

359
00:22:35,952 --> 00:22:37,329
What?

360
00:22:37,454 --> 00:22:38,747
You can't hear that?

361
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,123
It's prom night out there.

362
00:22:40,248 --> 00:22:42,167
Don't know how you can
sleep through it.

363
00:22:42,292 --> 00:22:43,376
Oh.

364
00:22:43,502 --> 00:22:46,254
My whole cycle
has been disrupted.

365
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:50,133
Princess and the pea.

366
00:22:51,635 --> 00:22:55,055
Hey, man. Hey, guys.
Come on. Cool it.

367
00:22:55,138 --> 00:22:56,598
Hey, hey!

368
00:22:56,681 --> 00:22:58,767
Come on, man.
People are trying to sleep.

369
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,727
Whoa!

370
00:23:00,811 --> 00:23:02,729
Oh! Hannah...

371
00:23:02,813 --> 00:23:05,565
Oh, Hannah. Hannah?

372
00:23:09,027 --> 00:23:10,445
Hannah?

373
00:23:12,197 --> 00:23:14,032
Uh-oh. What's she on?

374
00:23:14,157 --> 00:23:16,034
Nothing.
We just had champagne.

375
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,702
Don't bullshit me.

376
00:23:17,828 --> 00:23:20,080
She's on acid.

377
00:23:20,163 --> 00:23:22,499
OK. Just breathe.

378
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,251
Harry, get out of the way.

379
00:23:24,376 --> 00:23:26,420
Out of the way.

380
00:23:26,545 --> 00:23:27,879
Somebody get a wet towel, please.

381
00:23:28,004 --> 00:23:29,381
Is she going to be OK?

382
00:23:29,506 --> 00:23:30,841
Yeah. Just get the towel.

383
00:23:30,966 --> 00:23:33,093
Come on, honey.
Just breathe.

384
00:23:33,176 --> 00:23:34,928
Oh, when did she drop it?

385
00:23:35,011 --> 00:23:36,388
2 hours, maybe.

386
00:23:36,513 --> 00:23:38,348
2 hours.
Man, she's going to be...

387
00:23:38,432 --> 00:23:39,558
really messed up.

388
00:23:39,683 --> 00:23:40,851
You guys should take off.

389
00:23:40,976 --> 00:23:43,061
No way. Leave her here?

390
00:23:43,186 --> 00:23:45,063
Like, we don't
even know you.

391
00:23:45,188 --> 00:23:46,606
I'm a friend
of her mother's.

392
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:49,359
Ha! Yeah, right.

393
00:23:49,484 --> 00:23:51,236
Yeah. Hannah's mother?

394
00:23:51,361 --> 00:23:52,738
Are you kidding me?

395
00:23:52,863 --> 00:23:55,741
Lavinia Kingsley, handsome.

396
00:23:55,866 --> 00:23:57,200
Now scram.

397
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:02,330
Go on. Get out of here!

398
00:24:02,414 --> 00:24:03,832
It's OK.

399
00:24:03,915 --> 00:24:06,585
She looks really sick.

400
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,336
Her mother is Vinnie?

401
00:24:10,046 --> 00:24:11,298
Yeah.

402
00:24:13,467 --> 00:24:14,634
Oh.

403
00:24:17,387 --> 00:24:19,222
I know. Just breathe.

404
00:24:20,807 --> 00:24:23,226
Ooh, all right. That's OK.

405
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,062
That's OK.

406
00:24:25,187 --> 00:24:28,065
Oh, boy! That's it. Let it go.

407
00:24:28,148 --> 00:24:29,858
Let it go.

408
00:24:29,941 --> 00:24:31,026
Just let it go, sweetie.

409
00:24:31,109 --> 00:24:32,194
Just let it go.

410
00:24:32,277 --> 00:24:33,570
Ohh, there's another one!

411
00:24:33,653 --> 00:24:36,364
Oh, Harry.
You may never shit again.

412
00:24:36,448 --> 00:24:39,743
OK. All right.

413
00:24:39,826 --> 00:24:41,244
Good girl.

414
00:24:47,084 --> 00:24:48,502
Here.

415
00:24:51,254 --> 00:24:52,839
It's all right now.

416
00:24:52,923 --> 00:24:55,342
Just think
of a nice blue sky.

417
00:25:00,013 --> 00:25:01,932
Mom.

418
00:25:03,683 --> 00:25:06,103
I'll get you home.
Don't worry.

419
00:25:06,186 --> 00:25:08,105
Just relax.

420
00:25:08,188 --> 00:25:10,440
You're going
to feel better now.

421
00:25:35,966 --> 00:25:37,551
Come on. Let's go.

422
00:25:39,469 --> 00:25:41,179
Come on! Let's go!

423
00:25:47,144 --> 00:25:49,771
Down here,
to the kids' wing.

424
00:25:49,896 --> 00:25:51,148
What?

425
00:25:51,231 --> 00:25:52,482
The kids' wing.

426
00:25:52,566 --> 00:25:53,817
Wing?

427
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,943
Mm-hmm.

428
00:26:02,367 --> 00:26:03,869
Barkley.

429
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,580
Ha ha ha! OK.

430
00:26:06,705 --> 00:26:07,581
Barkley.

431
00:26:07,706 --> 00:26:10,333
Hannah. The dog...
Take the dog.

432
00:26:10,459 --> 00:26:11,460
The dog.

433
00:26:11,585 --> 00:26:13,295
Um...

434
00:26:15,297 --> 00:26:16,965
have you talked
to my mother?

435
00:26:17,048 --> 00:26:19,676
Hey. It's between you and her.

436
00:26:21,136 --> 00:26:24,264
Come on, Barkley.
Get in there.

437
00:26:52,417 --> 00:26:53,835
Excuse me.

438
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,880
Excuse me.
May I help you?

439
00:26:57,005 --> 00:26:58,715
Hey, Vin.

440
00:27:01,676 --> 00:27:03,970
Suzette?

441
00:27:04,054 --> 00:27:05,472
Yep.

442
00:27:05,555 --> 00:27:09,726
Oh, my God.
Is that really you?

443
00:27:09,851 --> 00:27:11,228
Yeah.

444
00:27:11,353 --> 00:27:13,897
Well, no. I mean,
the tits aren't me.

445
00:27:14,022 --> 00:27:15,524
They, um... They're fake...

446
00:27:15,607 --> 00:27:18,068
but in here somewhere,
it's me!

447
00:27:19,611 --> 00:27:20,904
What are you doing here?

448
00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:23,073
I... I brought Hannah home.

449
00:27:23,198 --> 00:27:24,199
My daughter?

450
00:27:24,282 --> 00:27:27,494
Yeah. She's OK.
She's in bed.

451
00:27:29,579 --> 00:27:30,997
No, she is not.

452
00:27:31,081 --> 00:27:33,417
She is not in bed.
It's her prom night...

453
00:27:33,542 --> 00:27:34,418
and she was going
to spend the night...

454
00:27:34,543 --> 00:27:35,836
with Carol Bishop.

455
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,047
No, Vin.
She's in bed. Go look.

456
00:27:41,258 --> 00:27:43,969
Why would you be
bringing her home?

457
00:27:44,094 --> 00:27:45,512
'Cause they were partying...

458
00:27:45,595 --> 00:27:48,515
you know, at the hotel
that I'm staying at...

459
00:27:48,598 --> 00:27:50,976
and she needed
a ride home, so...

460
00:27:51,101 --> 00:27:53,311
I gave her one.

461
00:27:53,437 --> 00:27:54,980
That doesn't make sense.

462
00:27:55,105 --> 00:27:56,815
You're leaving something out...

463
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,692
Like what about the...

464
00:27:58,775 --> 00:28:00,861
Jules, her date?

465
00:28:00,944 --> 00:28:02,863
I don't know. I mean,
they kind of went off...

466
00:28:02,946 --> 00:28:05,365
I guess,
with the other kids or something.

467
00:28:05,449 --> 00:28:07,033
You know, you're making me
really nervous, Vin.

468
00:28:07,117 --> 00:28:09,369
I mean, I'm just, like...
I'm freaking out here, man.

469
00:28:09,453 --> 00:28:13,874
I mean, aren't you,
like, glad to see me?

470
00:28:18,795 --> 00:28:22,007
Suzette,
what is it that you want?

471
00:28:22,132 --> 00:28:24,176
Who said
I wanted anything?

472
00:28:24,301 --> 00:28:26,344
You just show up
here out of the blue...

473
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:28,513
in Phoenix,
16 years later?

474
00:28:28,638 --> 00:28:30,515
20.

475
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,350
Or 20.

476
00:28:32,476 --> 00:28:34,519
You want money.

477
00:28:34,644 --> 00:28:36,021
Who told you that?

478
00:28:36,146 --> 00:28:37,522
I'm asking you.

479
00:28:37,647 --> 00:28:39,024
That I want money?

480
00:28:39,149 --> 00:28:40,859
That is so fucked up!

481
00:28:40,984 --> 00:28:42,736
Shh!

482
00:28:42,819 --> 00:28:45,655
I mean, my being in Phoenix
has nothing to do with you.

483
00:28:45,739 --> 00:28:48,033
Are you
telling me the truth?

484
00:28:48,158 --> 00:28:50,202
No. Shit.
OK, Vinnie. Hold on.

485
00:28:50,327 --> 00:28:52,162
I got fired from my job.

486
00:28:52,287 --> 00:28:55,999
What did you tell my daughter?

487
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:58,460
I named every guy
you ever rattled.

488
00:28:58,543 --> 00:29:00,045
That is not funny,
Suzette.

489
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:03,173
She didn't even know
who I was, Vinnie.

490
00:29:03,298 --> 00:29:04,674
Of course not.

491
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,343
My husband, my children,
my community...

492
00:29:06,468 --> 00:29:08,220
They don't know anything
about that period...

493
00:29:08,345 --> 00:29:09,888
when you and I were... friends.

494
00:29:10,013 --> 00:29:12,349
The people that
I associated with then...

495
00:29:12,474 --> 00:29:15,185
yourself included, they're...

496
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,687
they're...

497
00:29:17,813 --> 00:29:21,066
no longer a part
of my current reality.

498
00:29:21,191 --> 00:29:22,859
Oh, fuck your current reality.

499
00:29:22,943 --> 00:29:25,237
I mean,
look at you with your pools...

500
00:29:25,362 --> 00:29:27,030
and your fountains.
I mean, come on, Vinnie.

501
00:29:27,114 --> 00:29:28,949
Don't call me Vinnie.
Nobody calls me that.

502
00:29:29,032 --> 00:29:30,492
My name is Lavinia.

503
00:29:30,575 --> 00:29:31,701
Vinnie.

504
00:29:31,827 --> 00:29:34,037
All right.
I will give you $5,000...

505
00:29:34,121 --> 00:29:35,664
to get out of my life.

506
00:29:37,374 --> 00:29:39,918
I didn't come here
to harangue you.

507
00:29:40,043 --> 00:29:42,421
- Harass.
- Whatever.

508
00:29:42,546 --> 00:29:45,215
You are so uptight.

509
00:29:46,842 --> 00:29:48,718
So uptight.

510
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,556
I'm not uptight.

511
00:29:52,681 --> 00:29:54,057
I just brought the kid home...

512
00:29:54,141 --> 00:29:55,559
because she needed a ride...

513
00:29:55,684 --> 00:29:57,894
and she did.
She needed a ride.

514
00:29:58,019 --> 00:30:01,398
Suzette, I am not
without gratitude.

515
00:30:01,481 --> 00:30:04,359
But that girl
is on the dean's list.

516
00:30:04,443 --> 00:30:05,902
She's going to Vassar
in the fall.

517
00:30:06,027 --> 00:30:07,070
She's the valedictorian...

518
00:30:07,195 --> 00:30:08,697
of her graduating class.

519
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,490
I get it.

520
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:13,577
Don't worry.

521
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,996
I didn't tell her anything.

522
00:30:20,167 --> 00:30:22,753
La-La-La-La-Lavinia.

523
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,429
Down.

524
00:30:41,688 --> 00:30:43,231
Hannah. Hannah, wake up.

525
00:30:43,356 --> 00:30:45,609
I need to talk with you.

526
00:30:47,027 --> 00:30:48,445
Ginger!

527
00:30:48,528 --> 00:30:50,072
This doesn't concern you. Out.

528
00:30:50,197 --> 00:30:51,740
Close the door, please.

529
00:30:51,865 --> 00:30:53,408
I want to sleep.

530
00:30:53,533 --> 00:30:55,452
Well, you'll have plenty of time...

531
00:30:55,535 --> 00:30:56,953
to sleep after this.

532
00:30:57,037 --> 00:30:58,955
I'm going
to ask you something...

533
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,583
and I won't tolerate anything
but the truth.

534
00:31:03,543 --> 00:31:06,463
Did you do drugs
at the prom last night?

535
00:31:06,546 --> 00:31:08,090
What are you talking about?

536
00:31:08,215 --> 00:31:09,633
Did you do drugs?

537
00:31:09,716 --> 00:31:11,134
Answer me honestly.

538
00:31:18,141 --> 00:31:19,726
I had wine.

539
00:31:21,311 --> 00:31:23,897
I stupidly had 2 kinds...
red and white...

540
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,899
and the mixture
makes you sick.

541
00:31:25,982 --> 00:31:28,235
I didn't even know that
till after.

542
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,239
And that's all?

543
00:31:32,322 --> 00:31:34,241
That was enough.

544
00:31:56,012 --> 00:31:57,931
I'm a guest
of Harry Plummer.

545
00:31:58,014 --> 00:31:59,933
He gave me his key... 419.

546
00:32:00,016 --> 00:32:02,602
Mr. Plummer has changed rooms.

547
00:32:02,686 --> 00:32:05,605
He's now in room 1007.

548
00:32:07,023 --> 00:32:08,442
Thank you.

549
00:32:27,502 --> 00:32:28,545
Harry?

550
00:32:29,838 --> 00:32:31,715
Hi. They cleaned up the vomit...

551
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,049
but I had to move.

552
00:32:33,175 --> 00:32:34,426
Of course you did.

553
00:32:34,551 --> 00:32:36,470
Oh, I'm so hungry.

554
00:32:36,553 --> 00:32:38,013
I just got to eat something.

555
00:32:38,096 --> 00:32:39,514
Here. You want one?

556
00:32:39,598 --> 00:32:42,059
You should
have something substantial, Suzette.

557
00:32:42,184 --> 00:32:44,227
Let me
order up some breakfast.

558
00:32:44,352 --> 00:32:45,729
No. I'm not staying.

559
00:32:45,854 --> 00:32:47,731
I'm going to change my clothes.

560
00:32:47,856 --> 00:32:49,900
Then I'm going to take off.

561
00:32:50,025 --> 00:32:53,528
Oh. I've drawn you a bath.

562
00:32:57,532 --> 00:32:59,576
You've drawn me a bath?

563
00:32:59,701 --> 00:33:00,911
Mm-hmm.

564
00:33:01,036 --> 00:33:02,079
You didn't even know...

565
00:33:02,204 --> 00:33:04,039
when I was going to be here.

566
00:33:04,122 --> 00:33:06,666
I've been letting it out
and adding hot.

567
00:33:14,633 --> 00:33:17,427
I'm not in the same mood
I was in yesterday, Harry.

568
00:33:17,552 --> 00:33:18,929
No, no, no. Sure.

569
00:33:19,054 --> 00:33:20,430
It's just that it's been...

570
00:33:20,555 --> 00:33:22,808
a hell of a long night,
you know.

571
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,066
When are you going
to shoot your father?

572
00:33:32,484 --> 00:33:34,277
Not today. It's Sunday.

573
00:33:45,122 --> 00:33:46,998
Harry?

574
00:33:47,124 --> 00:33:49,000
What?

575
00:33:49,126 --> 00:33:51,002
Come on in.

576
00:33:51,128 --> 00:33:52,504
Aren't you naked?

577
00:33:52,629 --> 00:33:55,882
Just come on in.
I want to talk.

578
00:33:58,844 --> 00:33:59,928
Yes?

579
00:34:00,011 --> 00:34:01,972
Sit down.

580
00:34:08,186 --> 00:34:09,604
Oh, man.

581
00:34:09,688 --> 00:34:13,066
I was like a blemish
in her prissy little world.

582
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:15,902
You should have
seen that place, Harry.

583
00:34:15,986 --> 00:34:18,739
Even the kids have a wing.

584
00:34:20,323 --> 00:34:21,700
And there's Vin...

585
00:34:21,825 --> 00:34:23,869
going around
like a princess...

586
00:34:23,994 --> 00:34:27,038
and the pool's all going.

587
00:34:27,164 --> 00:34:29,708
Ahh. She had her nose
fucked with, too.

588
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:31,710
I didn't say anything
to her, but...

589
00:34:31,835 --> 00:34:33,545
I don't know.
It was definitely...

590
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,630
not her nose, Harry.

591
00:34:38,175 --> 00:34:42,137
Man, she is in dreamland.

592
00:34:42,262 --> 00:34:44,181
And then she looks at me...

593
00:34:44,264 --> 00:34:46,016
like I'm some kind
of voodoo ghost...

594
00:34:46,099 --> 00:34:47,517
from her past, you know...

595
00:34:47,601 --> 00:34:49,352
Scared to death
I'm going to, like...

596
00:34:49,436 --> 00:34:50,854
blow her cover.

597
00:34:54,691 --> 00:34:56,401
She offered me money...

598
00:34:56,526 --> 00:34:58,570
to disappear, Harry.

599
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:04,076
I didn't take it.

600
00:35:04,201 --> 00:35:07,621
I wouldn't touch it
with a 10-foot pole.

601
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:11,541
At least you have integrity.

602
00:35:16,797 --> 00:35:19,049
Yeah. Integrity...

603
00:35:19,132 --> 00:35:20,592
and I'm broke.

604
00:35:20,717 --> 00:35:22,469
Oh! Ooh!

605
00:35:22,552 --> 00:35:24,513
Ptoo! I got something...

606
00:35:24,596 --> 00:35:25,597
You want water?

607
00:35:25,722 --> 00:35:27,349
No, don't dote on me, Harry.

608
00:35:27,432 --> 00:35:29,393
Actually,
I do want some water, please.

609
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:33,814
Who the hell
knows I'm here?

610
00:35:33,897 --> 00:35:36,650
I don't know.
The hotel, for a start.

611
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:44,032
Answer the phone, Harry.

612
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:51,081
Hello? Yes.

613
00:35:51,206 --> 00:35:52,666
Uh, yes.

614
00:35:56,169 --> 00:35:58,588
No. Sure.
Please come up.

615
00:35:58,672 --> 00:36:00,882
Room 1007.

616
00:36:00,966 --> 00:36:02,843
Who was that?

617
00:36:02,926 --> 00:36:04,344
Lavinia.

618
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:05,846
What?!

619
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,266
She said
she needs to see you.

620
00:36:09,391 --> 00:36:10,767
Oh, my God!

621
00:36:10,892 --> 00:36:12,436
After all I told you...

622
00:36:12,561 --> 00:36:14,354
you think I want her
coming up here?

623
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:15,856
I just followed my instincts,
Suzette.

624
00:36:15,939 --> 00:36:17,232
You're not
following your instincts...

625
00:36:17,315 --> 00:36:20,110
you're following hers!
She manipulates people!

626
00:36:20,193 --> 00:36:23,029
I hate you right now, Harry!

627
00:36:24,614 --> 00:36:25,949
Oh, God.

628
00:36:33,957 --> 00:36:35,250
Lavinia Kingsley.

629
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:36,752
Harry Plummer.

630
00:36:36,835 --> 00:36:38,670
Suzette's
just wiping herself...

631
00:36:38,795 --> 00:36:41,131
drying herself off.
She had a bath.

632
00:36:41,256 --> 00:36:42,632
Oh.

633
00:36:42,758 --> 00:36:44,301
I don't want to interrupt...

634
00:36:44,426 --> 00:36:45,802
something.

635
00:36:45,927 --> 00:36:48,221
No, no, no. Please
come in, Mrs. Kingsley.

636
00:36:48,305 --> 00:36:49,431
Thank you, Mr. Plummer.

637
00:36:49,514 --> 00:36:50,932
I'll just be 2 seconds, really...

638
00:36:51,016 --> 00:36:52,434
You better be here
to apologize...

639
00:36:52,517 --> 00:36:54,770
because you treated me
like the scum of the earth...

640
00:36:54,853 --> 00:36:56,438
and if you think
those flowers are going...

641
00:36:56,521 --> 00:36:58,106
to make me feel better,
you're sadly mistaken.

642
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,941
I'm going to smoke,
Harry. Endure it.

643
00:37:00,025 --> 00:37:01,777
You have every right
to be offended...

644
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,278
and I do apologize.

645
00:37:03,361 --> 00:37:05,280
That is why I am here.

646
00:37:15,123 --> 00:37:17,000
Will you join me for lunch...

647
00:37:17,125 --> 00:37:18,585
tomorrow afternoon?

648
00:37:20,629 --> 00:37:23,215
And what will happen
at lunch, Lavinia?

649
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,008
Well, I would like
the opportunity...

650
00:37:25,133 --> 00:37:27,803
to explain to you why
I'm no longer the person...

651
00:37:27,886 --> 00:37:29,304
that I was years ago...

652
00:37:29,388 --> 00:37:30,972
how I've changed... for
the better, I think...

653
00:37:31,056 --> 00:37:33,141
and the direction that
my life has gone in.

654
00:37:33,225 --> 00:37:34,142
For instance,
I'm very much involved...

655
00:37:34,226 --> 00:37:35,143
in charity work...

656
00:37:35,227 --> 00:37:36,770
and there's actually
a tree planted...

657
00:37:36,853 --> 00:37:38,271
near city hall
with my name on it...

658
00:37:38,355 --> 00:37:39,606
right here in Phoenix...

659
00:37:39,689 --> 00:37:40,941
Phoenix being
the mythical bird...

660
00:37:41,024 --> 00:37:42,275
that rose from the ashes...

661
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:43,610
I, too,
have become someone...

662
00:37:43,693 --> 00:37:44,945
that you don't know, Suzette.

663
00:37:45,028 --> 00:37:46,279
And I would
like the opportunity...

664
00:37:46,363 --> 00:37:47,989
to introduce myself to you.

665
00:37:48,073 --> 00:37:49,491
People do change, Suzette.

666
00:37:49,574 --> 00:37:51,868
Not that it's been easy.
It hasn't been.

667
00:37:51,993 --> 00:37:54,704
But I could not
be the person that I was...

668
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:56,206
because the person that I was...

669
00:37:56,331 --> 00:37:58,083
is not the person that I am.

670
00:37:58,208 --> 00:37:59,918
Vinnie, stop, OK?
'Cause you're going...

671
00:38:00,043 --> 00:38:01,503
right up your own asshole...

672
00:38:01,586 --> 00:38:03,505
and I don't feel
like following.

673
00:38:03,588 --> 00:38:05,507
I know what
she means, though.

674
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:07,509
Why, thank you.

675
00:38:07,592 --> 00:38:09,219
Harry, enough.

676
00:38:09,344 --> 00:38:11,555
Vinnie,
I'm not ashamed of my past.

677
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,056
At least I'm not
walking around...

678
00:38:13,181 --> 00:38:14,516
in some Lance Robe and slippers...

679
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:16,017
pretending that
it never happened.

680
00:38:16,101 --> 00:38:17,728
My husband is a lawyer!

681
00:38:17,853 --> 00:38:19,855
Oh, yeah? What are you
going to do, sue me?

682
00:38:19,938 --> 00:38:21,690
Could you just
let me finish, please?

683
00:38:21,773 --> 00:38:23,734
And he aspires
to a career in politics.

684
00:38:23,859 --> 00:38:25,569
Hey. The first lady
of the land...

685
00:38:25,694 --> 00:38:27,487
is going to be a Banger Sister?

686
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:28,530
I am not a Banger Sister!

687
00:38:28,613 --> 00:38:30,240
Look, I am a mother...

688
00:38:30,365 --> 00:38:31,908
and I am a very good mother.

689
00:38:32,033 --> 00:38:33,994
Hannah told me everything...

690
00:38:34,077 --> 00:38:35,328
about what happened
at the prom.

691
00:38:35,412 --> 00:38:36,663
She told me
that she drank...

692
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:37,998
red and white wine,
and the combination...

693
00:38:38,081 --> 00:38:39,541
of the two made her queasy.

694
00:38:39,624 --> 00:38:41,376
Queasy?
She was really out of it...

695
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,544
Mrs. Kingsley.

696
00:38:42,627 --> 00:38:43,712
Wasn't she, Suzette?

697
00:38:43,795 --> 00:38:45,088
Oh, I don't think so, Harry.

698
00:38:45,213 --> 00:38:47,466
She would have
told her mother everything.

699
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:51,053
So, what time's lunch?

700
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:53,013
I beg your pardon?

701
00:38:53,096 --> 00:38:54,765
Yeah.
We're going to lunch.

702
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:56,099
You said.

703
00:38:56,224 --> 00:38:58,226
Oh.
Yeah, but I have just...

704
00:38:58,351 --> 00:39:00,062
said everything
that I planned...

705
00:39:00,145 --> 00:39:02,022
to say at lunch.

706
00:39:02,105 --> 00:39:04,316
You know,
where I come from, Lavinia...

707
00:39:04,441 --> 00:39:06,318
which, granted,
is a hellhole...

708
00:39:06,443 --> 00:39:07,652
in West Hollywood...

709
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:10,489
The people go on and on and on
and on about themselves...

710
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:11,907
all day long.

711
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:13,867
They at least
have the decency...

712
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,285
to ask the other person...

713
00:39:15,368 --> 00:39:18,288
"So, what's new with you?"

714
00:39:18,413 --> 00:39:19,956
Noon, in the lobby?

715
00:39:20,082 --> 00:39:21,625
Look, Suzette,
I am not self-indulgent.

716
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,293
I may be a lot of things...

717
00:39:23,418 --> 00:39:25,754
but that is one thing
that I am not.

718
00:39:25,837 --> 00:39:29,049
Then why are you still
talking about yourself?

719
00:39:30,133 --> 00:39:31,385
And by the way,
how did you know...

720
00:39:31,468 --> 00:39:33,011
what room I was staying in?

721
00:39:33,136 --> 00:39:35,847
Oh, I described you
to the clerk at the desk.

722
00:39:37,307 --> 00:39:40,519
Ugh! "I described you
to the clerk at the desk."

723
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:42,854
I got to get some drinks in here...

724
00:39:42,979 --> 00:39:45,315
and get her mojo going, man.

725
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,817
But first, I got to crash.

726
00:39:46,942 --> 00:39:48,318
Oh, I'm so tired.

727
00:39:48,443 --> 00:39:50,529
Oh, yeah. This is good.

728
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:04,709
Harry?

729
00:40:06,503 --> 00:40:08,713
What did he do to you...
your father...

730
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:10,757
to make you
love him so much?

731
00:40:12,968 --> 00:40:15,345
He put a kind
of curse on me.

732
00:40:17,431 --> 00:40:18,849
How'd he do that?

733
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:22,394
We had a family business...

734
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:24,563
selling furniture.
I hated it.

735
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:26,565
I wanted to be a writer.

736
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,066
He hated that.

737
00:40:28,191 --> 00:40:29,568
"Go ahead," he said.

738
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:31,069
"Everything you touch...

739
00:40:31,194 --> 00:40:33,071
is going to turn to shit.

740
00:40:33,196 --> 00:40:34,573
You'll look back someday...

741
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:37,242
and there'll be nothing
to look at."

742
00:40:37,367 --> 00:40:39,703
Well, you took off anyway, see?

743
00:40:39,786 --> 00:40:41,121
I like that.

744
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:45,250
And then you blew
into Hollywood?

745
00:40:45,375 --> 00:40:46,752
Yeah.

746
00:40:48,211 --> 00:40:50,088
It was great.

747
00:40:50,213 --> 00:40:52,924
The whole world
wanted a piece of me.

748
00:40:53,049 --> 00:40:55,761
You know, everybody
was jumping into bed...

749
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:58,764
with everybody
back in those days.

750
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:01,433
I had a Dodge Duster.

751
00:41:01,558 --> 00:41:05,604
Every Friday night,
I'd eat at Joe Allen's.

752
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:07,939
God, it was fabulous.

753
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:10,025
You mean, you drove?

754
00:41:12,986 --> 00:41:16,114
Gold Dodge Duster
with white vinyl seats.

755
00:41:19,576 --> 00:41:21,536
Did you have a girlfriend?

756
00:41:23,163 --> 00:41:24,706
Yeah.

757
00:41:24,831 --> 00:41:26,374
What happened?

758
00:41:27,834 --> 00:41:29,252
Everything fell to pieces...

759
00:41:29,336 --> 00:41:31,254
just the way
he said it would.

760
00:41:31,338 --> 00:41:33,590
Well, come on.
You're giving the old man...

761
00:41:33,673 --> 00:41:35,592
too much credit.

762
00:41:35,675 --> 00:41:37,594
You're not
selling furniture.

763
00:41:37,677 --> 00:41:39,930
Is he still doing that?

764
00:41:40,013 --> 00:41:41,431
No.

765
00:41:43,016 --> 00:41:45,060
He's...

766
00:41:45,185 --> 00:41:47,437
He's at some place...

767
00:41:47,521 --> 00:41:49,439
called Horizon Hills.

768
00:41:49,523 --> 00:41:52,067
It's a retirement community.

769
00:42:05,372 --> 00:42:06,873
Don't move.

770
00:42:09,209 --> 00:42:11,962
You can do
whatever you want...

771
00:42:12,045 --> 00:42:14,548
but you're not allowed
to think.

772
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,726
You're thinking, Harry.

773
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:29,146
I'm terrified.

774
00:42:29,229 --> 00:42:30,522
Shut up.

775
00:42:30,647 --> 00:42:31,857
OK.

776
00:42:49,916 --> 00:42:53,086
Good morning...
Mrs. Plummer.

777
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:55,964
Hey, you've got 2 things
going for you.

778
00:42:56,047 --> 00:42:57,257
One is that
I'm in a good mood...

779
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:59,092
and two is that you're cute.

780
00:43:01,678 --> 00:43:03,096
Oh, Suzette.

781
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:05,140
I came to apologize
in person.

782
00:43:05,223 --> 00:43:06,808
I completely forgot
about Ginger.

783
00:43:06,933 --> 00:43:08,101
She's taking
her driver's test today.

784
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:09,686
- Ginger?
- My 16-year-old.

785
00:43:09,811 --> 00:43:11,188
I can't tell you
how important this is.

786
00:43:11,313 --> 00:43:12,773
I have to cancel lunch.
I apologize.

787
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:13,857
This is for you.

788
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,108
Are you trying
to weasel out of this?

789
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:16,443
No! This is one...

790
00:43:16,526 --> 00:43:17,861
of those rites
of passage moments.

791
00:43:17,986 --> 00:43:19,196
I have to be there.

792
00:43:19,321 --> 00:43:21,364
Well, I'll go with you.

793
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:23,033
Oh.

794
00:43:23,158 --> 00:43:25,577
Mom, what are you doing?

795
00:43:25,702 --> 00:43:27,370
Nothing.

796
00:43:27,496 --> 00:43:29,414
Who's that?

797
00:43:29,539 --> 00:43:31,833
Suzette, my friend.

798
00:43:31,917 --> 00:43:34,377
Your friend?

799
00:43:34,503 --> 00:43:35,545
All right.
Just get in the car.

800
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:37,547
I'll be there in a minute.

801
00:43:37,672 --> 00:43:39,257
No, you're not ditching me.

802
00:43:39,383 --> 00:43:40,467
You made a date...

803
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:42,177
and I got all dressed up.

804
00:43:45,514 --> 00:43:49,393
OK. I just have
to get organized.

805
00:43:49,518 --> 00:43:51,728
Excuse me. Hi.
Would you please...

806
00:43:51,853 --> 00:43:53,230
take this up to room 1007?

807
00:43:53,355 --> 00:43:54,731
And don't water it.

808
00:43:54,856 --> 00:43:56,274
It doesn't need watering.

809
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,567
They've already
been watered...

810
00:43:57,692 --> 00:43:59,069
so you don't have
to water them.

811
00:43:59,194 --> 00:44:00,404
Come on. Let's go.

812
00:44:00,529 --> 00:44:03,240
Don't water them. Please.

813
00:44:03,365 --> 00:44:05,992
OK. In case you'd noticed...

814
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:07,369
there's one other thing.
You probably won't.

815
00:44:07,452 --> 00:44:09,329
But Ginger has
just a little habit of...

816
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:10,664
She makes a little noise
in the back...

817
00:44:10,747 --> 00:44:12,833
of her throat sometimes...

818
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:14,209
and the specialists
say it's nothing.

819
00:44:14,292 --> 00:44:15,585
It's probably
going to dissolve...

820
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:17,129
in a matter of time,
and then...

821
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:18,213
- Great.
- Yeah.

822
00:44:18,296 --> 00:44:19,381
But our policy is just to...

823
00:44:19,464 --> 00:44:21,258
It's just... We're
going to ignore it.

824
00:44:22,884 --> 00:44:25,262
Take a breath, Gin.

825
00:44:25,387 --> 00:44:28,932
I wanted a tattoo, Mom,
but you said I couldn't.

826
00:44:29,057 --> 00:44:31,268
Just stay
in your lane, honey.

827
00:44:31,393 --> 00:44:32,936
Is her tongue pierced?

828
00:44:33,061 --> 00:44:34,604
Sweetheart,
it's not nice to talk...

829
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:36,273
about people
in front of them...

830
00:44:36,398 --> 00:44:37,858
as if they're not there.

831
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:39,317
I know someone
who had her labia pierced.

832
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:41,319
All right, concentrate
on your driving, Gin.

833
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:42,821
And I better not
get the guy Jennifer got.

834
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:44,156
He failed her for talking.

835
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:45,907
All right. Well, don't
talk, then. Just drive.

836
00:44:45,991 --> 00:44:47,409
That's the way
accidents happen.

837
00:44:47,492 --> 00:44:49,077
From talking?
I don't think so, Mom.

838
00:44:49,161 --> 00:44:50,412
Stay in your lane.

839
00:44:50,495 --> 00:44:52,038
What lane are you referring to?

840
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:53,248
The lane that you're in!

841
00:44:53,331 --> 00:44:54,750
Well, if I'm in it,
then what's the problem?

842
00:44:54,833 --> 00:44:56,084
Will you look where
you're driving?!

843
00:45:01,173 --> 00:45:03,258
It's always been
much harder with Ginger...

844
00:45:03,341 --> 00:45:05,093
than with Hannah,
because Hannah tends...

845
00:45:05,177 --> 00:45:06,928
to be solution-oriented,
whereas Ginger...

846
00:45:07,012 --> 00:45:09,097
Well, she's artistic,
which is, of course...

847
00:45:09,181 --> 00:45:11,600
what I love about her
and always want...

848
00:45:11,683 --> 00:45:14,352
to encourage,
but she does tend to be defiant.

849
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:16,521
You didn't name her
after Ginger Baker...

850
00:45:16,646 --> 00:45:17,856
- did you?
- No.

851
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:19,524
I was pregnant
and craving ginger...

852
00:45:19,649 --> 00:45:21,193
so I ate it every day.

853
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:22,652
Oh. Way better.

854
00:45:22,736 --> 00:45:24,488
Gosh. What time is it?

855
00:45:24,571 --> 00:45:25,614
I don't know.

856
00:45:25,739 --> 00:45:26,782
Course you don't.

857
00:45:26,907 --> 00:45:28,658
Oh, gosh, I hope
she passes this thing.

858
00:45:28,742 --> 00:45:30,160
It's going to be so good...

859
00:45:30,243 --> 00:45:31,661
for her self-esteem.

860
00:45:31,745 --> 00:45:33,663
You know that guy Harry...
the guy you met?

861
00:45:33,747 --> 00:45:35,165
He doesn't drive.

862
00:45:35,248 --> 00:45:36,666
He might now, though...

863
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:38,668
'cause we had sex last night.

864
00:45:38,752 --> 00:45:41,421
First time in 10 years
for that guy.

865
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:43,590
I kind of liked it,
though, you know?

866
00:45:43,673 --> 00:45:45,425
I felt like I was
accomplishing something.

867
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:47,594
Boy, when he came,
it was like somebody...

868
00:45:47,677 --> 00:45:49,096
in an electric chair.

869
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:50,931
I thought you were
in a relationship...

870
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:52,265
the two of you.

871
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:54,101
No, no.
I just picked him up...

872
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:55,602
like, somewhere in Blythe...

873
00:45:55,685 --> 00:45:58,438
and he's not
a bad rattle, though.

874
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:00,774
There's hope for Harry.

875
00:46:00,857 --> 00:46:02,776
Hope for Harry.

876
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:06,613
I hate this place.

877
00:46:06,696 --> 00:46:08,949
I know.
Can you imagine working here?

878
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:10,075
Ha ha!

879
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,410
Oh, no color.

880
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:13,745
I'd go crazy.
I got to have color around me...

881
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:16,498
or I go nuts. I hate drab.

882
00:46:16,623 --> 00:46:19,376
You just looked
right at my dress...

883
00:46:19,459 --> 00:46:20,877
when you said that.

884
00:46:20,961 --> 00:46:22,170
I did not.

885
00:46:22,295 --> 00:46:23,338
Oh, you did.

886
00:46:23,463 --> 00:46:24,506
No, I didn't.

887
00:46:24,631 --> 00:46:25,674
Yes, you did.

888
00:46:25,799 --> 00:46:27,008
I would kill to have, uh...

889
00:46:27,134 --> 00:46:28,385
- Yeah.
- I would.

890
00:46:28,468 --> 00:46:30,220
Sure, Suzette.
It's almost the same color...

891
00:46:30,303 --> 00:46:32,222
as the... walls.

892
00:46:32,305 --> 00:46:34,224
Oh, come on. No, it isn't.

893
00:46:34,307 --> 00:46:36,226
Yes, it is.

894
00:46:36,309 --> 00:46:38,562
I'm the same color...

895
00:46:38,645 --> 00:46:41,064
as the department
of motor vehicles...

896
00:46:41,148 --> 00:46:44,317
and you... look like a flower.

897
00:46:46,695 --> 00:46:48,572
Why are you so pissed off?

898
00:46:48,697 --> 00:46:50,240
I'm not!
I'm complimenting you.

899
00:46:50,365 --> 00:46:53,410
I mean, all the guys here
are staring at you.

900
00:46:53,535 --> 00:46:54,911
That's the idea, isn't it?

901
00:46:56,371 --> 00:46:57,664
What idea?

902
00:46:57,748 --> 00:46:59,666
Well, I mean,
if you put yourself together...

903
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,334
the way that you've
put yourself together...

904
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:02,919
that's... obviously,
you're trying...

905
00:47:03,003 --> 00:47:04,045
to get attention.

906
00:47:04,171 --> 00:47:05,380
I don't look any different.

907
00:47:05,464 --> 00:47:06,882
Oh, please.

908
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:11,344
You used to be
much smaller-chested.

909
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:13,388
You mean,
my tits are bothering you.

910
00:47:13,472 --> 00:47:15,515
Oh, come on.
This machine is bothering me...

911
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:16,725
because it's not functioning.

912
00:47:16,808 --> 00:47:18,727
You know what? I think
you're, like, ticked off...

913
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:20,228
because you had
the big knockers...

914
00:47:20,312 --> 00:47:21,730
back in the day.

915
00:47:21,813 --> 00:47:23,023
- Well, please.
- No, yeah.

916
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:24,357
It's true. Come on, babe.

917
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:26,359
And you know what?
You used to, like...

918
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:27,527
you know, flash them...

919
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:29,404
and they were famous,
those tits...

920
00:47:29,488 --> 00:47:31,406
and I was flat as a pancake.

921
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:35,035
So I made, you know,
bigger... ones.

922
00:47:35,118 --> 00:47:37,037
So...

923
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,206
but if it makes you
feel any better...

924
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:40,373
I don't feel bad.
I don't need...

925
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:41,416
to feel better.

926
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,418
They're too big,
and, you know...

927
00:47:43,502 --> 00:47:44,920
I overdid it.

928
00:47:45,003 --> 00:47:46,755
Well, I wasn't going
to say anything...

929
00:47:46,838 --> 00:47:48,090
but they're too big.

930
00:47:48,173 --> 00:47:50,592
Yeah, I went from, like,
one extreme to the other.

931
00:47:50,675 --> 00:47:51,843
Aah!

932
00:47:51,968 --> 00:47:54,221
Mom, he failed me
for no reason!

933
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:55,555
Gin, what happened?

934
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:58,225
Nothing! I just drove
like a normal person.

935
00:47:58,308 --> 00:48:00,227
But he decided
to persecute me.

936
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:02,729
It says that you
ran a red light.

937
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:05,899
Yeah, right!
As if I'd do that on a test!

938
00:48:05,982 --> 00:48:07,567
Oh! And I told everybody...

939
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:09,569
I was taking this stupid thing!

940
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:11,071
I promised Jennifer...

941
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:13,740
I would drive her
to the Pickle Pan!

942
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:15,325
You know what? I can...

943
00:48:16,785 --> 00:48:18,829
I'm going to
take her home right now.

944
00:48:18,954 --> 00:48:20,330
She just treated you
like shit.

945
00:48:20,455 --> 00:48:21,832
Well, she's distraught!

946
00:48:21,957 --> 00:48:23,333
I'll drop you at the hotel.

947
00:48:23,458 --> 00:48:25,168
No, wait a minute.
This is not...

948
00:48:25,293 --> 00:48:26,670
This is, like, a big deal...

949
00:48:26,795 --> 00:48:28,004
We're not even
getting along.

950
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:29,339
Suzette, come on.

951
00:48:29,464 --> 00:48:31,925
We were going
to have lunch.

952
00:48:35,303 --> 00:48:36,847
Somebody left Barkley out.

953
00:48:36,972 --> 00:48:39,015
Barkley!

954
00:48:39,141 --> 00:48:40,517
Barkley!
Barkley, come here.

955
00:48:40,642 --> 00:48:42,144
Barkley! Gin.

956
00:48:42,227 --> 00:48:44,604
Ginger, get Barkley in.

957
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:46,857
I can't, Mom.
I'm too depressed.

958
00:48:46,982 --> 00:48:49,693
Hey. Get the dog.

959
00:48:49,818 --> 00:48:53,029
Come on, Barkley,
you stupid moron.

960
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:56,575
Hannah!
You left the gate open!

961
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,076
The dog got out!

962
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:01,580
Hannah,
turn the music off!

963
00:49:03,498 --> 00:49:05,250
Oh, Hannah.
Yeah, Hannah.

964
00:49:09,045 --> 00:49:09,921
Hannah?!

965
00:49:11,506 --> 00:49:13,383
Hannah!

966
00:49:13,508 --> 00:49:15,927
Break it up. Come on.
Break it up!

967
00:49:16,053 --> 00:49:17,429
Aah!

968
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:20,057
Mom!

969
00:49:20,182 --> 00:49:21,683
Come on, Hannah.
Get out of the pool.

970
00:49:21,767 --> 00:49:24,186
Jules, oh!
Get out of that pool!

971
00:49:24,269 --> 00:49:26,688
Hannah, stop it!

972
00:49:28,356 --> 00:49:29,441
Nothing was going on,
I swear to you.

973
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:30,609
Oh, right!

974
00:49:30,734 --> 00:49:31,693
I'm almost 18!

975
00:49:31,818 --> 00:49:33,737
I don't care
how old you are, Hannah.

976
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:35,363
You are still living
in my house.

977
00:49:35,489 --> 00:49:37,616
You are driving a car
that we paid for.

978
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:38,784
We have paid
for your college education.

979
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:39,951
As long as that is true...

980
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:41,453
you will abide
by our rules!

981
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:43,455
Do you understand?
Now, you get out of there!

982
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:46,458
Get dressed!
Turn the music off!

983
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:48,627
And you're not
helping matters.

984
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:50,128
What did I do?

985
00:49:50,253 --> 00:49:52,130
Well, you're just
so permissive-looking...

986
00:49:52,255 --> 00:49:54,299
standing there...
the way you stand.

987
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:57,094
But you said I looked
like a flower.

988
00:49:57,219 --> 00:50:00,514
Mom! I just
stepped on a snail!

989
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:02,599
There are no snails
on this property, Gin.

990
00:50:02,724 --> 00:50:04,851
What's this crunchy thing
I just, like, killed?

991
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:06,520
Jules!
I have known you...

992
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:08,855
since you've been
in preschool, young man.

993
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:10,816
This is so not the norm...

994
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:12,776
of how I behave,
Mrs. Kingsley.

995
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:37,426
Hannah, of all people.

996
00:50:37,509 --> 00:50:39,136
You don't think that maybe...

997
00:50:39,261 --> 00:50:40,804
they were just
skinny-dipping, do you?

998
00:50:40,929 --> 00:50:42,139
No. They were going at it.

999
00:50:42,264 --> 00:50:43,473
In the pool...

1000
00:50:43,598 --> 00:50:45,142
where we, as a family, swim?

1001
00:50:45,267 --> 00:50:48,311
- Yep.
- Oh! God.

1002
00:50:48,437 --> 00:50:50,105
You don't think maybe
they just could've been...

1003
00:50:50,188 --> 00:50:51,773
rubbing up
against each other?

1004
00:50:51,857 --> 00:50:52,983
No, they were fucking.

1005
00:50:53,108 --> 00:50:55,277
Oh, my God.
Hannah's the valedictorian...

1006
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,778
and that boy Jules...

1007
00:50:56,862 --> 00:50:59,531
He got a national award
for community service.

1008
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:01,950
He's a little weasel,
if you ask me.

1009
00:51:02,033 --> 00:51:03,118
Why do you say that?

1010
00:51:03,201 --> 00:51:04,327
He just is. I can tell.

1011
00:51:04,453 --> 00:51:06,621
You know,
I can smell it. Hey!

1012
00:51:06,705 --> 00:51:08,123
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do now.

1013
00:51:08,206 --> 00:51:09,624
Do you think
I'm supposed to call...

1014
00:51:09,708 --> 00:51:11,126
his parents and tell them?

1015
00:51:11,209 --> 00:51:12,586
You're asking me?

1016
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:17,799
Why are you wasting
all those lemons?

1017
00:51:17,883 --> 00:51:19,593
Lemons eliminate odor, Suzette.

1018
00:51:19,676 --> 00:51:23,388
Oh, my God.
You are so freaked out about this.

1019
00:51:23,513 --> 00:51:24,806
Yes, I am.

1020
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:26,892
School's out,
and they're seniors...

1021
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:28,894
and they came back,
and they had a few beers...

1022
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:30,645
and they got naked
in the pool.

1023
00:51:30,771 --> 00:51:32,647
I mean,
they're just having fun.

1024
00:51:32,731 --> 00:51:35,734
They are kids!

1025
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:38,904
I want to show you something.

1026
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:41,573
- Come here.
- What?

1027
00:51:41,698 --> 00:51:44,076
Refresh your memory.

1028
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:46,078
Look at this.

1029
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:48,080
Those aren't kids?

1030
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:50,040
Oh, my God.

1031
00:51:50,165 --> 00:51:51,958
Remember we sat up there
over Sunset Boulevard...

1032
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:53,293
waiting for the sun to come up?

1033
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:54,628
Until the cops
made us get down.

1034
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:55,962
Mmm. Sunrise over Sunset.

1035
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:57,297
Just get to the point.

1036
00:51:57,381 --> 00:51:59,299
Well, it was your idea
to climb up there...

1037
00:51:59,383 --> 00:52:01,093
in the first place.
Do you know why?

1038
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:02,427
- No.
- Exactly.

1039
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:04,262
We just did stuff.
We just did shit...

1040
00:52:04,388 --> 00:52:05,597
for no reason, Vin.

1041
00:52:06,932 --> 00:52:08,350
My God. That's Raymond.

1042
00:52:08,433 --> 00:52:09,851
My husband.

1043
00:52:09,935 --> 00:52:11,186
What are you going
to do with me?

1044
00:52:11,269 --> 00:52:12,521
Am I going to hide
in the closet?

1045
00:52:12,604 --> 00:52:13,855
No, no.
He knows about you.

1046
00:52:13,939 --> 00:52:15,399
I've just been a little sketchy,
that's all.

1047
00:52:15,482 --> 00:52:16,525
Like how sketchy?

1048
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:17,859
I said we went
to college together.

1049
00:52:17,943 --> 00:52:19,194
I went to college?

1050
00:52:19,277 --> 00:52:20,529
Yeah.

1051
00:52:20,612 --> 00:52:22,572
I'm a really bad liar, Vinnie.

1052
00:52:22,656 --> 00:52:25,992
OK. Then just tell
the minimum amount of truth.

1053
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:26,993
Hi, honey.

1054
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:28,120
Hi. Hi.

1055
00:52:28,245 --> 00:52:30,872
Whoa! Sorry. Sorry.

1056
00:52:30,997 --> 00:52:33,125
Oh, this is Suzette.

1057
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:34,126
Suzette?

1058
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:36,294
We were roommates
in Los Angeles.

1059
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:37,921
Oh, Suzette. Yes,
of course. Of course.

1060
00:52:38,046 --> 00:52:39,005
Suzette. Suzette.

1061
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:41,675
Hi. You went to UCLA?

1062
00:52:41,758 --> 00:52:45,095
I saw Country Joe
and the Fish there.

1063
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:48,724
Oh. Ha ha ha!

1064
00:52:50,225 --> 00:52:53,854
Yeah. So, uh,
stay for dinner, Suzette.

1065
00:52:53,937 --> 00:52:56,189
Lavinia and I would love
to have you for dinner.

1066
00:52:56,273 --> 00:52:57,691
Please. Stay for dinner.

1067
00:52:57,774 --> 00:52:59,192
- Sure.
- OK.

1068
00:52:59,276 --> 00:53:00,652
Cool.

1069
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:03,488
Groovy.

1070
00:53:09,202 --> 00:53:10,620
I'm staying for dinner.

1071
00:53:10,704 --> 00:53:12,122
Yeah.

1072
00:53:23,258 --> 00:53:24,801
Is Mom's friend for real?

1073
00:53:24,926 --> 00:53:26,303
I don't know.

1074
00:53:26,428 --> 00:53:28,638
I don't care.

1075
00:53:33,018 --> 00:53:34,770
Get out of my room, OK?

1076
00:53:34,853 --> 00:53:36,605
All you ever do is eat...

1077
00:53:36,688 --> 00:53:38,231
and you're so skinny.

1078
00:53:38,315 --> 00:53:39,733
What's your problem?

1079
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:43,487
Mom caught me in the pool...

1080
00:53:43,612 --> 00:53:44,988
with Jules.

1081
00:53:48,617 --> 00:53:49,993
So?

1082
00:53:51,828 --> 00:53:54,748
We weren't swimming.

1083
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:56,249
Eww.

1084
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:57,751
Your own mother?

1085
00:53:57,834 --> 00:53:59,419
Shut up.
It was horrible.

1086
00:53:59,503 --> 00:54:01,421
She stood there
and made us...

1087
00:54:01,505 --> 00:54:02,923
get out of the pool.

1088
00:54:03,006 --> 00:54:04,424
It was so embarrassing.

1089
00:54:04,508 --> 00:54:05,842
It's the worst thing...

1090
00:54:05,926 --> 00:54:07,511
that's ever happened to me.

1091
00:54:07,636 --> 00:54:09,179
I failed my driving test.

1092
00:54:09,304 --> 00:54:11,181
You're allowed to fail.
I'm not.

1093
00:54:11,306 --> 00:54:13,850
I don't even know
what it feels like.

1094
00:54:13,975 --> 00:54:16,144
Look at me.
Look. Look at this.

1095
00:54:16,228 --> 00:54:18,814
I'm on every single page
of this yearbook.

1096
00:54:18,897 --> 00:54:20,273
Ugh!

1097
00:54:22,984 --> 00:54:24,361
And tomorrow,
I'm expected...

1098
00:54:24,486 --> 00:54:26,863
to get up in front
of the entire school...

1099
00:54:26,988 --> 00:54:28,365
and say something profound...

1100
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:30,534
so that all the grads
will run off...

1101
00:54:30,659 --> 00:54:32,035
into the future...

1102
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,204
and live happily ever after...

1103
00:54:34,329 --> 00:54:36,206
Such a lie.

1104
00:54:36,331 --> 00:54:39,167
I wish I could just
get up there and fart.

1105
00:54:39,251 --> 00:54:40,502
Ha!

1106
00:54:40,585 --> 00:54:41,837
Why don't you?

1107
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,380
Yeah, right.

1108
00:54:43,505 --> 00:54:45,716
All my teachers,
the head of school...

1109
00:54:45,841 --> 00:54:47,718
Dad, Mom...

1110
00:54:47,843 --> 00:54:50,220
especially Mom...

1111
00:54:50,345 --> 00:54:53,265
Can you imagine her reaction?

1112
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,812
Well, at least
it wouldn't be boring.

1113
00:55:04,735 --> 00:55:07,988
"Success is going
from failure to failure...

1114
00:55:08,071 --> 00:55:10,323
without loss
of enthusiasm."

1115
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:12,325
Winston Churchill.

1116
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:14,077
But what if the person
testing you...

1117
00:55:14,202 --> 00:55:16,580
has such bad body odor,
you can't even concentrate?

1118
00:55:16,705 --> 00:55:19,082
Red light means stop, Ginger.

1119
00:55:19,207 --> 00:55:21,126
New topic. Hannah...

1120
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:23,045
how's your speech coming?

1121
00:55:23,128 --> 00:55:24,838
I'm thinking of
doing something unconventional.

1122
00:55:24,921 --> 00:55:27,174
Well,
that's always a good idea.

1123
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:29,843
If it were always
a good idea...

1124
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:31,595
it wouldn't be
unconventional.

1125
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:33,096
You're going to do fine.

1126
00:55:33,221 --> 00:55:35,098
You look great.
You have a lot of color...

1127
00:55:35,223 --> 00:55:36,516
in your face.

1128
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:39,061
Have you been out
in the sun today?

1129
00:55:39,144 --> 00:55:40,896
Yeah, Hannah.

1130
00:55:44,983 --> 00:55:46,401
Ginger, Ginger.

1131
00:55:46,485 --> 00:55:48,487
Relax your throat
when you're eating.

1132
00:55:48,612 --> 00:55:50,072
Yeah, Ginger.

1133
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:53,575
Suzette?

1134
00:55:53,658 --> 00:55:55,368
Mm-hmm?

1135
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:56,995
You knew my wife
before I did...

1136
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,915
Actually,
before all of us did.

1137
00:55:59,998 --> 00:56:03,085
Has she changed
over all these years?

1138
00:56:05,003 --> 00:56:06,963
I see the same person.

1139
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:11,927
What do the two of you
have in common?

1140
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:14,846
What do we have in common, Vin?

1141
00:56:16,723 --> 00:56:20,811
We, uh, went to
the occasional concert.

1142
00:56:20,936 --> 00:56:22,145
Yeah.

1143
00:56:22,270 --> 00:56:23,480
Yeah.

1144
00:56:23,605 --> 00:56:25,982
Hmm.
What kind of concerts?

1145
00:56:26,108 --> 00:56:28,610
Rock.

1146
00:56:28,693 --> 00:56:29,861
It had to be
really rock, though.

1147
00:56:29,986 --> 00:56:30,946
Didn't it, babe?

1148
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:34,533
Babe?

1149
00:56:34,658 --> 00:56:36,493
We had very high standards.

1150
00:56:36,618 --> 00:56:38,537
Wait. Like, bands?

1151
00:56:38,662 --> 00:56:41,289
Ha ha!
Mom in a mosh pit?

1152
00:56:43,875 --> 00:56:46,461
Standing there
holding her purse.

1153
00:56:46,545 --> 00:56:49,214
With her hair all perfect.

1154
00:56:50,507 --> 00:56:51,717
"Come on, everyone. Let's go.

1155
00:56:51,842 --> 00:56:53,176
It's getting late."

1156
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:57,723
This is
a little difficult...

1157
00:56:57,848 --> 00:56:59,307
to picture, Lavinia.

1158
00:56:59,433 --> 00:57:01,351
Vinnie... Vin.

1159
00:57:01,476 --> 00:57:03,395
Yeah, babe.

1160
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,646
She danced.

1161
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:07,566
That's what she did.
She danced.

1162
00:57:07,691 --> 00:57:09,067
Our mother?

1163
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:16,116
Our mom's a really,
really, really bad dancer.

1164
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:18,452
That was what was
so really, really...

1165
00:57:18,535 --> 00:57:19,953
really genius about it.

1166
00:57:20,036 --> 00:57:21,955
You didn't care
what anybody thought...

1167
00:57:22,038 --> 00:57:23,457
did you, babe?

1168
00:57:29,004 --> 00:57:30,672
Lavinia?

1169
00:57:35,302 --> 00:57:36,553
Lavinia?

1170
00:57:41,933 --> 00:57:45,896
Anybody know what
Suzette's tattoo stands for?

1171
00:57:45,979 --> 00:57:47,272
Hmm?

1172
00:57:47,397 --> 00:57:49,232
Don't say anything, Suzette.

1173
00:57:49,357 --> 00:57:52,152
It's a lizard with a crown
on its head. Anybody?

1174
00:57:54,196 --> 00:57:55,072
Hmm?

1175
00:57:55,197 --> 00:57:58,158
I have no idea.

1176
00:57:58,241 --> 00:57:59,993
Jim Morrison.

1177
00:58:00,077 --> 00:58:02,120
"I am the Lizard King."

1178
00:58:02,245 --> 00:58:04,790
He also called himself
"Mr. Mojo Risin"'...

1179
00:58:04,915 --> 00:58:07,542
which were the letters
of his name...

1180
00:58:07,667 --> 00:58:09,044
scrambled up.

1181
00:58:09,127 --> 00:58:11,213
He wrote it in Mexico...

1182
00:58:11,296 --> 00:58:15,008
having been up all night...

1183
00:58:15,092 --> 00:58:19,221
after climbing
the pyramid of the sun.

1184
00:58:21,223 --> 00:58:23,392
Mom, you're being weird.

1185
00:58:23,475 --> 00:58:25,143
Yeah. You're acting...

1186
00:58:25,268 --> 00:58:26,686
like a whole different person.

1187
00:58:29,439 --> 00:58:32,359
You are acting
a little strange, Lavinia.

1188
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:37,197
Oh, you have no idea
how strange I can be.

1189
00:58:40,158 --> 00:58:41,868
What the hell was that?

1190
00:58:41,952 --> 00:58:43,370
Chicken breast.

1191
00:59:16,361 --> 00:59:17,446
Suzette?

1192
00:59:17,529 --> 00:59:19,698
I'm trapped out here
in the suburbs, Harry.

1193
00:59:19,823 --> 00:59:22,492
I'm getting to see
how the other half live.

1194
00:59:22,617 --> 00:59:24,536
I don't know.
It's really weird.

1195
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:26,830
It's complicated
having all your shit together.

1196
00:59:26,955 --> 00:59:28,415
You've made progress
since yesterday.

1197
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:30,125
Yesterday, she didn't
even want to see you.

1198
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:31,543
That's great.
It's terrific.

1199
00:59:31,668 --> 00:59:33,378
I don't know.
What are you doing?

1200
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:35,213
You sound speedy.

1201
00:59:35,338 --> 00:59:36,882
I'm writing like a fiend.

1202
00:59:37,007 --> 00:59:38,467
Yeah?
What are you writing?

1203
00:59:38,592 --> 00:59:40,802
I don't know. Everything.
Words, thoughts, images.

1204
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:43,221
It's all just kind of
exploding out of me.

1205
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:44,806
I feel so ebullient.

1206
00:59:44,931 --> 00:59:46,850
Ebullient?

1207
00:59:47,934 --> 00:59:50,020
You just got off, Harry.
That's all.

1208
00:59:50,145 --> 00:59:52,189
It's more than that,
Suzette.

1209
00:59:52,314 --> 00:59:54,107
It's... It's...

1210
00:59:56,526 --> 00:59:58,111
I think you're my muse.

1211
00:59:58,195 --> 00:59:59,780
Uh, Harry, wait a minute.

1212
00:59:59,863 --> 01:00:02,407
I'm just a chick you
met in the desert, OK?

1213
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:03,992
Yes, exactly. And if I...

1214
01:00:04,117 --> 01:00:05,952
I... I wouldn't have met
you in the desert...

1215
01:00:06,036 --> 01:00:07,954
if I hadn't screwed up
my life so beautifully.

1216
01:00:08,038 --> 01:00:09,706
Where are you
going with this?

1217
01:00:09,831 --> 01:00:11,625
If I had done
one thing different...

1218
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:13,960
if one little thing had
worked out and gone right...

1219
01:00:14,044 --> 01:00:16,463
my whole life would have gone
in some other direction.

1220
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:18,673
Instead, everything went wrong
and led me to you.

1221
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:20,717
Hey, you're way
ahead of yourself.

1222
01:00:22,302 --> 01:00:25,305
Then I shouldn't
feel something for you?

1223
01:00:25,389 --> 01:00:27,474
No, no. You can feel
whatever you want...

1224
01:00:27,557 --> 01:00:29,476
but, you know,
just don't make...

1225
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:31,645
a three-act play out of it.

1226
01:00:31,728 --> 01:00:33,397
When are you coming home?

1227
01:00:33,522 --> 01:00:34,398
Home?

1228
01:00:34,523 --> 01:00:36,858
I mean back,
you know, to the hotel.

1229
01:00:36,942 --> 01:00:39,736
Um... Harry, listen...

1230
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:41,738
write whatever
you want, you know.

1231
01:00:41,863 --> 01:00:44,157
Just dig it out
of yourself, babe...

1232
01:00:44,241 --> 01:00:47,828
because that's where it is.
It's all in there, OK?

1233
01:00:47,911 --> 01:00:49,413
Now, go for it.

1234
01:00:49,538 --> 01:00:51,039
See you later.

1235
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:25,615
Does our mom
have a secret life?

1236
01:01:25,699 --> 01:01:27,617
Let me tell you something
about your mother.

1237
01:01:27,743 --> 01:01:30,120
It wouldn't kill you to be
just a little bit nicer to her.

1238
01:01:30,245 --> 01:01:32,205
How would she know
about Van Morrison...

1239
01:01:32,289 --> 01:01:33,623
all of a sudden?

1240
01:01:33,749 --> 01:01:36,626
Jim Morrison,
not Van Morrison. Jeez.

1241
01:01:36,710 --> 01:01:39,629
OK, Jim Morrison. She was
talking about him like she...

1242
01:01:39,713 --> 01:01:40,839
knew him or something.

1243
01:01:40,964 --> 01:01:42,049
Do the dishes, OK?

1244
01:01:42,132 --> 01:01:43,633
The dishes? Rosa does them.

1245
01:01:43,759 --> 01:01:45,052
Rosa who?

1246
01:01:45,135 --> 01:01:46,261
I don't know.

1247
01:01:46,344 --> 01:01:47,804
You have people
wiping your ass...

1248
01:01:47,929 --> 01:01:49,347
and you don't even
know their names.

1249
01:01:49,473 --> 01:01:51,016
Hannah, did you hear that?!

1250
01:01:51,141 --> 01:01:52,851
Just do the dishes, OK?
You wash.

1251
01:01:52,976 --> 01:01:54,728
You dry.
Here's the sponge.

1252
01:01:54,811 --> 01:01:56,063
And no using the dishwasher.

1253
01:01:56,146 --> 01:01:57,147
Why?

1254
01:01:57,272 --> 01:01:58,940
Because you're spoiled brats,
that's why.

1255
01:01:59,024 --> 01:02:00,108
No, we're not.

1256
01:02:00,233 --> 01:02:01,818
Look at all this shit
that you've got.

1257
01:02:01,943 --> 01:02:03,320
Look... Look. What's this?

1258
01:02:03,403 --> 01:02:04,488
A banana hammock.

1259
01:02:04,613 --> 01:02:05,614
Oh, right.

1260
01:02:05,739 --> 01:02:07,157
A hammock for your bananas.

1261
01:02:07,282 --> 01:02:08,366
I mean...

1262
01:02:08,492 --> 01:02:10,285
not everybody has one of those.

1263
01:02:10,368 --> 01:02:12,829
We don't need
to be lectured by you.

1264
01:02:12,954 --> 01:02:14,664
You don't even know us.

1265
01:02:18,835 --> 01:02:22,047
You and I go way back,
little Miss Prom Queen.

1266
01:02:22,172 --> 01:02:25,300
We want to know
about our mother.

1267
01:02:26,927 --> 01:02:28,678
She was a blast.

1268
01:02:28,804 --> 01:02:29,888
She was...

1269
01:02:30,013 --> 01:02:31,473
a kick-ass girlfriend.

1270
01:02:31,598 --> 01:02:33,100
Wait. What does that mean?

1271
01:02:33,183 --> 01:02:34,559
What did she do?

1272
01:02:34,684 --> 01:02:37,020
Did she smoke weed?
Did she get drunk...

1273
01:02:37,104 --> 01:02:39,523
and puke all over the place,
have sex?

1274
01:02:39,606 --> 01:02:41,316
Did she ever
do anything wrong?

1275
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:45,362
Where's your father?

1276
01:02:45,445 --> 01:02:48,490
No place I'll ever go in again.

1277
01:03:16,143 --> 01:03:17,394
Ow! Oh, jeez.

1278
01:03:29,906 --> 01:03:31,283
What are you doing?

1279
01:03:33,243 --> 01:03:35,912
I want to go out...

1280
01:03:36,037 --> 01:03:39,958
without my... watch...

1281
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:44,296
but everything
that I own is beige.

1282
01:04:07,944 --> 01:04:10,572
Come on, Vinnie.
Let's go. What's taking so long?

1283
01:04:12,866 --> 01:04:13,784
Harry?

1284
01:04:15,368 --> 01:04:17,287
Here. Do me up, will you?

1285
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:19,623
Vin, what are you
doing in there?

1286
01:04:19,706 --> 01:04:22,125
Suzette, you look so...

1287
01:04:24,211 --> 01:04:25,253
iridescent.

1288
01:04:25,379 --> 01:04:26,797
Thank you.

1289
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,799
Will you be very late?

1290
01:04:28,882 --> 01:04:30,008
Definitely.

1291
01:04:31,468 --> 01:04:33,595
Ready or not, here I come.

1292
01:04:37,933 --> 01:04:39,309
Oh, my God.

1293
01:04:43,397 --> 01:04:45,023
Your hair.

1294
01:04:47,067 --> 01:04:47,984
Oh...

1295
01:04:48,068 --> 01:04:48,985
Yeah?

1296
01:04:49,069 --> 01:04:50,779
- Oh...
- Well?

1297
01:04:50,862 --> 01:04:53,156
It's fucking great, man.

1298
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:54,866
Yeah?

1299
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:56,827
Yeah, yeah.

1300
01:04:56,910 --> 01:04:59,830
Harry, come over here.
Tell me what you think.

1301
01:05:05,085 --> 01:05:06,545
That took some guts.

1302
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:07,754
OK. Ready, huh?

1303
01:05:07,838 --> 01:05:08,964
Let's go.

1304
01:05:09,047 --> 01:05:09,881
All right!

1305
01:05:10,006 --> 01:05:11,341
You get the purses.

1306
01:05:11,466 --> 01:05:13,343
Oh, bye.

1307
01:05:13,468 --> 01:05:14,344
Bye.

1308
01:05:14,469 --> 01:05:15,595
Be brilliant.

1309
01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:17,013
Say good night, Harry.

1310
01:05:17,139 --> 01:05:19,599
Good night, Harry. Aah!
Oh, God. That scared me.

1311
01:05:19,683 --> 01:05:22,519
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

1312
01:05:34,072 --> 01:05:36,032
Oh, oh, my.

1313
01:05:36,116 --> 01:05:37,826
What?

1314
01:05:37,951 --> 01:05:39,703
I just forgot
it's so crowded and loud...

1315
01:05:39,828 --> 01:05:41,538
and dirty and sweaty
and... it's... I...

1316
01:05:41,663 --> 01:05:43,123
Vinnie, come on. Come on.

1317
01:05:43,206 --> 01:05:45,292
All right. Just give me a second.
Just another minute.

1318
01:05:45,375 --> 01:05:46,752
OK, all right, all right.

1319
01:05:46,877 --> 01:05:48,420
Your minute's up.
Let's go, let's go.

1320
01:05:48,545 --> 01:05:49,880
Oh, Suze, Suze.

1321
01:05:50,005 --> 01:05:51,506
Come on, let's just
work our way in, babe.

1322
01:05:51,631 --> 01:05:53,133
What do you want to drink?

1323
01:05:53,216 --> 01:05:55,844
- How about coffee?
- Vinnie! Come on.

1324
01:05:55,969 --> 01:05:58,472
Get me something with, like,
a little sword or something.

1325
01:05:58,555 --> 01:06:00,557
You got it, baby.
You got it.

1326
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:03,060
Sorry. Excuse me.
Sorry. Excuse me.

1327
01:06:03,185 --> 01:06:04,519
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

1328
01:06:04,603 --> 01:06:06,813
That was completely my fault.
Oh, my God.

1329
01:06:06,897 --> 01:06:08,648
Suzette, I'm just
knocking into everybody.

1330
01:06:08,732 --> 01:06:09,900
Aah! Aah!

1331
01:06:10,025 --> 01:06:12,235
Sorry. I'm so sorry.
Suzette! Suzette!

1332
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:13,945
Yeah! Over here, honey.

1333
01:06:14,071 --> 01:06:15,697
Come on, come on.

1334
01:06:15,822 --> 01:06:17,574
I got us some chairs.

1335
01:06:17,699 --> 01:06:20,243
You still have
such great bar instincts.

1336
01:06:20,368 --> 01:06:23,121
Well, you're
in my territory, honey.

1337
01:06:23,246 --> 01:06:26,875
Oh, OK.
So, now what do we do?

1338
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,460
A rum and Coke
and a tiki.

1339
01:06:28,585 --> 01:06:31,713
Anything you want.
Anything you want!

1340
01:06:31,838 --> 01:06:35,133
How about checking out
the bartender's ass?

1341
01:06:35,258 --> 01:06:36,468
Hooray!

1342
01:06:36,593 --> 01:06:37,677
She's back.

1343
01:06:37,761 --> 01:06:39,596
He looks a little like
Rod Stewart. A little bit.

1344
01:06:39,721 --> 01:06:41,264
He does look like Rod Stewart.

1345
01:06:41,390 --> 01:06:43,100
Look at
his little Rod Stewart ass.

1346
01:06:43,225 --> 01:06:45,644
Not so loud, not so loud.
He's gonna hear you.

1347
01:06:45,769 --> 01:06:47,104
All right.

1348
01:06:47,229 --> 01:06:51,274
Excuse me.
Would you like to dance?

1349
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:54,444
Oh... that's so sweet
of you, but no. I'm married.

1350
01:06:54,569 --> 01:06:57,239
And I have a number
of children and a house...

1351
01:06:57,364 --> 01:06:59,324
and a dog...
a golden retriever, actually.

1352
01:06:59,449 --> 01:07:02,160
That's so nice of you
to ask me. Thank you very much.

1353
01:07:02,285 --> 01:07:04,621
That was really nice
of him, wasn't it?

1354
01:07:08,291 --> 01:07:09,668
OK, it's time.

1355
01:07:09,793 --> 01:07:10,961
- For what?
- Let's dance.

1356
01:07:11,086 --> 01:07:12,754
I don't think so.

1357
01:07:12,879 --> 01:07:13,964
Put your purse down.

1358
01:07:14,089 --> 01:07:15,173
- No, I can't.
- Honey.

1359
01:07:15,298 --> 01:07:16,425
Not yet.

1360
01:07:16,508 --> 01:07:17,968
Vinnie, come on, honey.
Let go.

1361
01:07:18,093 --> 01:07:18,969
No.

1362
01:07:19,094 --> 01:07:20,303
Please, honey.
Let go of your purse.

1363
01:07:20,429 --> 01:07:21,847
I can't. I can't.

1364
01:07:21,972 --> 01:07:24,266
All right, drink up.
Heads up. OK?

1365
01:07:24,349 --> 01:07:26,309
Hey, Rod, check our...

1366
01:07:26,393 --> 01:07:28,311
Look after our things,
will you? We're gonna dance.

1367
01:07:28,437 --> 01:07:29,646
Sure thing.

1368
01:07:31,022 --> 01:07:33,734
I don't think it's
the right speed for me.

1369
01:07:33,817 --> 01:07:36,945
It's just a little not right.
Too fast.

1370
01:07:37,028 --> 01:07:39,197
Come on, honey.
Loosen up.

1371
01:09:35,772 --> 01:09:36,982
Woo! Woo!

1372
01:10:38,126 --> 01:10:40,629
What a blast, huh?

1373
01:10:40,754 --> 01:10:43,298
What are you
looking at, honey?

1374
01:10:51,681 --> 01:10:55,310
Look at all the stars.

1375
01:10:55,394 --> 01:10:57,896
How many can you name, Vin?

1376
01:10:59,523 --> 01:11:00,649
Zero.

1377
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:05,821
Have you ever been
to Europe, Vinnie?

1378
01:11:05,904 --> 01:11:07,155
Oh, yeah.

1379
01:11:08,615 --> 01:11:10,450
Did you go to Paris, France?

1380
01:11:10,534 --> 01:11:11,660
Mm-hmm.

1381
01:11:13,203 --> 01:11:15,831
Did you go to
that big famous cemetery...

1382
01:11:15,914 --> 01:11:17,791
where Jim is?

1383
01:11:17,874 --> 01:11:19,584
Pere-Lachaise.

1384
01:11:22,379 --> 01:11:24,131
What was it like?

1385
01:11:29,428 --> 01:11:30,512
Sad.

1386
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:38,478
Yeah.

1387
01:12:21,188 --> 01:12:22,439
Shut the door.

1388
01:12:22,564 --> 01:12:23,774
OK, OK.

1389
01:12:23,899 --> 01:12:26,234
I want you to know
just for the record...

1390
01:12:26,318 --> 01:12:28,945
that I myself have not
seen this for 20 years.

1391
01:12:29,071 --> 01:12:29,946
What?

1392
01:12:30,072 --> 01:12:31,948
You'll see it.
You'll see it.

1393
01:12:32,074 --> 01:12:33,950
Just light that candle,
OK, over there.

1394
01:12:34,076 --> 01:12:34,951
Yeah.

1395
01:12:35,077 --> 01:12:36,161
OK.

1396
01:12:38,413 --> 01:12:41,291
You have no idea what
I'm gonna show you, hon?

1397
01:12:41,416 --> 01:12:42,793
Absolutely none?

1398
01:12:42,918 --> 01:12:44,961
What is it?
I have no idea.

1399
01:12:45,087 --> 01:12:46,797
It's gonna
be a total surprise to you?

1400
01:12:46,922 --> 01:12:48,465
You don't even
have a clue?

1401
01:12:48,590 --> 01:12:49,800
No!

1402
01:12:49,925 --> 01:12:51,343
Let's see.

1403
01:12:51,468 --> 01:12:53,136
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1404
01:12:56,098 --> 01:12:57,808
It is the...

1405
01:12:57,933 --> 01:12:59,810
Rock cock collection.

1406
01:12:59,935 --> 01:13:01,311
Oh, my God.
You said you threw...

1407
01:13:01,436 --> 01:13:02,813
the rock cock collection out.

1408
01:13:02,938 --> 01:13:04,314
You said it was history.

1409
01:13:04,439 --> 01:13:05,816
- No, I did not.
- Yes, you did.

1410
01:13:05,941 --> 01:13:07,317
I said it was history.

1411
01:13:07,442 --> 01:13:08,819
That's not the same thing
as throwing it out.

1412
01:13:08,944 --> 01:13:10,278
- Say you lied.
- I lied.

1413
01:13:10,362 --> 01:13:11,613
OK.

1414
01:13:11,696 --> 01:13:13,281
Close your eyes.
The names are on the back.

1415
01:13:13,365 --> 01:13:14,825
I'm nervous now, Vin.

1416
01:13:14,908 --> 01:13:18,161
Guess who
the first rock cock is.

1417
01:13:22,708 --> 01:13:24,292
Ooh.

1418
01:13:26,878 --> 01:13:28,046
Roger...

1419
01:13:30,549 --> 01:13:31,967
Waters.

1420
01:13:32,050 --> 01:13:33,301
Jimmy Page.

1421
01:13:33,385 --> 01:13:34,970
Give me that.
Are you kidding?

1422
01:13:35,053 --> 01:13:36,638
And this one is... Jimmy?

1423
01:13:36,722 --> 01:13:37,806
Very veiny and... Ooh!

1424
01:13:37,931 --> 01:13:39,015
"Arlo Guthrie."

1425
01:13:39,141 --> 01:13:40,559
Oh, no.
That's yours, babe.

1426
01:13:40,684 --> 01:13:42,644
You take that one.
Look at this.

1427
01:13:42,728 --> 01:13:43,812
- Ha ha!
- What?

1428
01:13:43,937 --> 01:13:45,021
Keith! That's Keith.

1429
01:13:45,147 --> 01:13:46,481
And this one is...

1430
01:13:46,565 --> 01:13:48,316
I get it
'cause I backlit it.

1431
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,484
Oh, my God.

1432
01:13:49,609 --> 01:13:51,153
This one is...
I don't even know. Oh, my God.

1433
01:13:51,278 --> 01:13:52,696
Where? Hold on,
hold on, hold on.

1434
01:13:52,779 --> 01:13:54,114
Hold on, hold on. No, no, no.

1435
01:13:54,197 --> 01:13:55,741
I'm gonna smoke this.

1436
01:13:55,866 --> 01:13:57,200
You're not gonna do that.

1437
01:13:57,284 --> 01:13:58,702
Yes, yes, yes, I am.

1438
01:13:58,785 --> 01:14:00,454
Come on, honey.
It's gonna be...

1439
01:14:00,537 --> 01:14:02,456
It's so old. How old is it?

1440
01:14:02,539 --> 01:14:04,541
Well, it's probably younger
than we are.

1441
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:11,757
Who is that?!

1442
01:14:11,882 --> 01:14:13,258
It looks ridiculous.

1443
01:14:13,383 --> 01:14:14,634
Who is that?!

1444
01:14:16,011 --> 01:14:17,095
I don't know.

1445
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:18,430
Look at this little guy
peeking out.

1446
01:14:18,555 --> 01:14:20,182
- Jesus Christ!
- I told you...

1447
01:14:23,018 --> 01:14:24,603
Boy, it's so rough.

1448
01:14:24,728 --> 01:14:25,937
Steve somebody.

1449
01:14:26,063 --> 01:14:26,938
Steve...

1450
01:14:27,064 --> 01:14:29,066
And here's... Steve...

1451
01:14:29,191 --> 01:14:31,359
Why didn't somebody
just stop us?!

1452
01:14:33,695 --> 01:14:34,780
Wow. That was so cool.

1453
01:14:34,905 --> 01:14:36,031
It was not...

1454
01:14:36,156 --> 01:14:37,741
- That's mine.
- It's so yours.

1455
01:14:37,866 --> 01:14:38,950
Oh, my gosh.

1456
01:14:40,077 --> 01:14:41,286
That's so kind of...

1457
01:14:41,411 --> 01:14:43,038
Looks like a nose or something.

1458
01:14:43,163 --> 01:14:44,664
This is totally fucked up.

1459
01:14:44,748 --> 01:14:45,665
Keith?

1460
01:14:45,749 --> 01:14:47,834
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, Suze!

1461
01:14:47,918 --> 01:14:50,128
Oh! Oh! Oh, my God.

1462
01:14:50,253 --> 01:14:51,630
I got it. Here.

1463
01:14:51,755 --> 01:14:53,965
Why didn't you just
put out the joint?

1464
01:14:54,091 --> 01:14:55,425
Here. I'll help you.

1465
01:14:55,550 --> 01:14:57,135
- Don't hit me.
- Oh, my God.

1466
01:14:58,428 --> 01:14:59,679
Oh, my God.

1467
01:14:59,763 --> 01:15:01,515
We're burning down the house.

1468
01:15:01,598 --> 01:15:02,516
Lavinia! Lavinia!

1469
01:15:02,599 --> 01:15:04,601
Oh, it's OK, honey.
Yeah?

1470
01:15:05,727 --> 01:15:06,812
Oh, God.

1471
01:15:06,937 --> 01:15:08,730
Hi, Raymond.

1472
01:15:10,023 --> 01:15:11,233
What happened, Lavinia?

1473
01:15:11,358 --> 01:15:12,442
Um, um...

1474
01:15:12,567 --> 01:15:14,778
Oh, my. Are these
what I think they are?

1475
01:15:14,903 --> 01:15:16,613
What do you think they are?

1476
01:15:16,738 --> 01:15:18,448
Well...

1477
01:15:18,573 --> 01:15:20,575
Lavinia, what... what...

1478
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:22,994
What are you wearing?

1479
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:24,996
What did you do
to your hair?!

1480
01:15:25,122 --> 01:15:26,957
She cut it.
Do you like it?

1481
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:27,958
Lavinia...

1482
01:15:28,041 --> 01:15:29,960
All right, Raymond, look...

1483
01:15:31,712 --> 01:15:33,422
you know how, um...

1484
01:15:33,547 --> 01:15:36,675
some people
collect baseball cards?

1485
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:39,136
Well, Suzette and I were...

1486
01:15:39,219 --> 01:15:40,971
What? What?
Photographers?

1487
01:15:44,474 --> 01:15:45,976
I'm sorry.

1488
01:15:46,059 --> 01:15:47,644
No, Raymond.

1489
01:15:50,647 --> 01:15:53,650
I'm so sorry. No, no.

1490
01:15:59,656 --> 01:16:03,869
No. We were... groupies.

1491
01:16:05,412 --> 01:16:07,914
You... You were...
You were groupies?

1492
01:16:07,998 --> 01:16:09,916
You were a groupie?

1493
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,918
Yeah.

1494
01:16:12,002 --> 01:16:13,587
And th... these... these
are pictures...

1495
01:16:13,670 --> 01:16:14,755
Of musicians.

1496
01:16:14,838 --> 01:16:15,756
Musicians?

1497
01:16:15,839 --> 01:16:17,215
And a few roadies.

1498
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:18,675
And a few roadies.

1499
01:16:20,135 --> 01:16:22,054
What do you mean,
that you were a groupie?

1500
01:16:27,559 --> 01:16:28,769
We...

1501
01:16:28,852 --> 01:16:30,437
Sorry.

1502
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:34,191
Oh, Dad, Mom, where are you?

1503
01:16:34,316 --> 01:16:36,193
Oh, shit!

1504
01:16:36,318 --> 01:16:37,986
- What have I done?
- Lavinia!

1505
01:16:38,111 --> 01:16:41,031
What are you doing?
Jeez. It smells like...

1506
01:16:41,114 --> 01:16:42,783
Here.

1507
01:16:42,866 --> 01:16:44,117
Hi, honey.

1508
01:16:59,466 --> 01:17:01,176
Uh...

1509
01:17:01,301 --> 01:17:03,261
it's, uh... Ginger.

1510
01:17:03,387 --> 01:17:05,347
She took my car.

1511
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:11,436
This is so stupid.

1512
01:17:11,561 --> 01:17:13,397
All I did was
bang into a parked car...

1513
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:15,899
a little bit,
and they take me to a hospital...

1514
01:17:16,024 --> 01:17:18,026
and force me
to wear this stupid thing?

1515
01:17:18,110 --> 01:17:20,404
Mom, what happened
to your hair?!

1516
01:17:20,529 --> 01:17:22,406
It's OK. Sit down.

1517
01:17:22,489 --> 01:17:24,908
I'm not injured, except for
the air bag hitting me in the face.

1518
01:17:24,991 --> 01:17:26,952
You were driving
without a license.

1519
01:17:27,077 --> 01:17:28,954
Then why don't they take me
to jail? It would make more sense.

1520
01:17:29,079 --> 01:17:31,248
You're in enough trouble already,
young lady.

1521
01:17:31,373 --> 01:17:33,333
I drove all over Phoenix, Dad.

1522
01:17:33,417 --> 01:17:35,252
That was the only car I hit.
It wasn't even my fault.

1523
01:17:35,377 --> 01:17:37,087
What do you mean,
it wasn't your fault?

1524
01:17:37,212 --> 01:17:38,797
Hannah gave me the keys.

1525
01:17:38,922 --> 01:17:40,799
You said
you'd stay on Blossom Circle.

1526
01:17:40,924 --> 01:17:42,759
It was too boring.
It was a circle.

1527
01:17:42,884 --> 01:17:45,178
You let your sister drive your car?

1528
01:17:45,262 --> 01:17:47,055
I can't believe
you were that irresponsible.

1529
01:17:47,139 --> 01:17:48,682
Me?! You have
a whole history of being...

1530
01:17:48,765 --> 01:17:51,101
irresponsible, it turns
out... you and Suzette.

1531
01:17:51,184 --> 01:17:52,728
Hey, I'm just standing here.

1532
01:17:52,811 --> 01:17:53,895
Doing what?

1533
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:55,772
What do you have
to do with our family...

1534
01:17:55,897 --> 01:17:57,607
besides coming in here
and wrecking it?

1535
01:17:57,733 --> 01:17:58,942
Everything was fine
until you showed up.

1536
01:17:59,067 --> 01:18:00,277
It was not fine.

1537
01:18:00,402 --> 01:18:01,611
She made it worse.

1538
01:18:01,737 --> 01:18:02,654
Suzette.

1539
01:18:02,779 --> 01:18:03,989
- Lavinia.
- Mom! You are such...

1540
01:18:04,114 --> 01:18:06,700
a hypocrite. You
freak out because I...

1541
01:18:06,783 --> 01:18:08,452
have sex in the pool
with my boyfriend?

1542
01:18:08,577 --> 01:18:10,078
- This is my job.
- The pool?

1543
01:18:10,203 --> 01:18:11,538
I'm just trying
to keep you safe.

1544
01:18:11,621 --> 01:18:12,581
I don't think
that's the problem...

1545
01:18:12,664 --> 01:18:13,582
with you breathing
down my neck.

1546
01:18:13,665 --> 01:18:14,750
Please be quiet.

1547
01:18:14,875 --> 01:18:15,792
I'm so safe,
I'm suffocating here.

1548
01:18:15,917 --> 01:18:16,793
I can't wait
to get out to college...

1549
01:18:16,918 --> 01:18:17,794
to get away from you.

1550
01:18:17,919 --> 01:18:19,129
This is a hospital,
for God's sake.

1551
01:18:19,254 --> 01:18:20,922
Will you just let her talk?
She's telling me...

1552
01:18:21,006 --> 01:18:22,632
what a shitty job
I'm doing as a mother.

1553
01:18:22,758 --> 01:18:23,717
This is a public place.

1554
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:25,385
Oh, what are you
so worried about...

1555
01:18:25,469 --> 01:18:27,054
You might lose a vote or two?

1556
01:18:27,137 --> 01:18:29,181
I'm worried about you. That's
what I'm worried about, Vinnie...

1557
01:18:29,306 --> 01:18:30,932
or whatever the hell
you're calling yourself these days.

1558
01:18:31,058 --> 01:18:32,976
One minute
you're pruning the plum trees...

1559
01:18:33,060 --> 01:18:35,187
the next you're putting penises
all over the floor.

1560
01:18:35,312 --> 01:18:36,188
Penises?

1561
01:18:36,313 --> 01:18:38,482
I have no idea who you are.

1562
01:18:38,607 --> 01:18:40,317
No. You don't.

1563
01:18:40,442 --> 01:18:42,819
You're right, because,
you know, I am so busy...

1564
01:18:42,903 --> 01:18:45,989
pruning the plum tree
and taking you to soccer...

1565
01:18:46,114 --> 01:18:48,366
and picking up all your shit...

1566
01:18:48,492 --> 01:18:50,369
and taking the dog...

1567
01:18:50,494 --> 01:18:52,621
for his umpteenth
distemper shot that...

1568
01:18:55,374 --> 01:18:56,792
I have lost me.

1569
01:19:03,590 --> 01:19:05,133
Can we go home, please?

1570
01:19:09,262 --> 01:19:11,973
I'm tired. I can't even see.

1571
01:19:12,057 --> 01:19:13,433
You know, we have...

1572
01:19:13,517 --> 01:19:14,643
graduation today.

1573
01:19:14,726 --> 01:19:16,686
Yeah, Mom, and I'm
really, really hungry.

1574
01:19:20,399 --> 01:19:23,860
You haven't heard a thing
I've said, have you?

1575
01:19:41,128 --> 01:19:42,671
What just happened?

1576
01:19:50,887 --> 01:19:51,805
Hello.

1577
01:19:51,888 --> 01:19:53,390
Harry, listen,
I'm coming back.

1578
01:19:53,515 --> 01:19:55,183
I'm gonna get my stuff,
get my car.

1579
01:19:55,308 --> 01:19:56,393
I'm leaving.

1580
01:19:56,518 --> 01:19:58,061
I'm going back to L.A.

1581
01:19:58,186 --> 01:20:00,689
- But...
- But nothing.

1582
01:20:00,814 --> 01:20:02,858
You're just a guy
I picked up, Harry.

1583
01:20:02,983 --> 01:20:04,901
I just picked you up,
all right?

1584
01:20:04,985 --> 01:20:08,321
I'm done talking.
Just stay out of my way.

1585
01:20:53,450 --> 01:20:55,827
Hannah and Ginger were really
angry at me. They're not...

1586
01:20:55,952 --> 01:20:57,829
It's not them.
They were right, Vin.

1587
01:20:57,954 --> 01:20:59,289
I don't belong here.

1588
01:20:59,414 --> 01:21:01,291
I don't know
where I belong.

1589
01:21:05,295 --> 01:21:07,839
I just came here to...

1590
01:21:09,383 --> 01:21:11,593
Oh, I don't know
why I came here.

1591
01:21:11,718 --> 01:21:13,762
I don't know
what I'm looking for.

1592
01:21:13,887 --> 01:21:16,431
I just know
I fuck things up.

1593
01:21:16,556 --> 01:21:19,142
I fucked things up really good.

1594
01:21:19,267 --> 01:21:20,435
I do that.

1595
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:21,478
No.

1596
01:21:21,561 --> 01:21:23,480
And you guys
are fighting and arguing.

1597
01:21:23,563 --> 01:21:24,648
I lost it.

1598
01:21:24,773 --> 01:21:26,149
It's just my fault.

1599
01:21:26,233 --> 01:21:27,943
No, it isn't. I lost it.

1600
01:21:28,068 --> 01:21:30,278
But that's what people do
when they...

1601
01:21:30,404 --> 01:21:33,323
love each other, is that
they yell at each other...

1602
01:21:33,407 --> 01:21:35,325
and they argue.

1603
01:21:35,409 --> 01:21:37,452
I'd give anything
to have a family...

1604
01:21:37,577 --> 01:21:39,287
to argue with
and fight with...

1605
01:21:39,413 --> 01:21:41,832
but I only have
a fucking cat...

1606
01:21:41,915 --> 01:21:43,959
who's not even
worth talking about.

1607
01:21:44,084 --> 01:21:46,837
But I'm your family.
You fight with me, right?

1608
01:21:46,962 --> 01:21:48,672
Oh, Vin.

1609
01:21:51,091 --> 01:21:53,135
My only claim to fame is...

1610
01:21:53,260 --> 01:21:55,971
that I let a zillion
zonked out musicians...

1611
01:21:56,096 --> 01:21:58,348
get in my pants
who don't even...

1612
01:22:01,435 --> 01:22:02,894
care about me.

1613
01:22:03,019 --> 01:22:04,896
Oh...

1614
01:22:05,021 --> 01:22:06,481
Oh, Vin.

1615
01:22:06,606 --> 01:22:09,276
I did, too, only I couldn't
even talk about it...

1616
01:22:09,359 --> 01:22:11,111
until you came along.

1617
01:22:11,194 --> 01:22:14,197
Now I'm laughing
about it and dancing.

1618
01:22:14,281 --> 01:22:15,323
Look at me.

1619
01:22:15,449 --> 01:22:18,618
Hmm? You're a force, sweetie.

1620
01:22:18,702 --> 01:22:20,954
I love that about you.

1621
01:22:21,038 --> 01:22:23,582
There's nobody else
like you, OK?

1622
01:22:23,707 --> 01:22:25,125
I love you.

1623
01:22:26,543 --> 01:22:28,670
I love you, too.

1624
01:22:28,795 --> 01:22:32,340
1, 2...

1625
01:22:32,466 --> 01:22:36,845
3, 4, 5, 6...

1626
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:40,265
7, 8, 9, 10.

1627
01:22:46,063 --> 01:22:47,981
You know,
there was a guy...

1628
01:22:48,065 --> 01:22:50,317
that was brought
in there on a stretcher.

1629
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:51,985
His face was all blue...

1630
01:22:52,069 --> 01:22:53,987
and he had a thing over him.

1631
01:22:54,071 --> 01:22:55,655
I thought he was dead.

1632
01:22:55,739 --> 01:22:57,574
Even he looked at my tits.

1633
01:23:00,035 --> 01:23:03,288
Well, maybe you revived him.

1634
01:23:05,248 --> 01:23:08,043
Oh, man.

1635
01:23:08,126 --> 01:23:09,586
I want to walk.

1636
01:23:09,711 --> 01:23:11,713
OK. Where do you want to go?

1637
01:24:14,443 --> 01:24:17,612
It's early. I don't
want to wake him up.

1638
01:24:32,794 --> 01:24:33,962
Where is he?

1639
01:24:34,046 --> 01:24:36,840
Oh, something's wrong.

1640
01:24:36,965 --> 01:24:38,341
- This isn't good.
- Why?

1641
01:24:38,425 --> 01:24:39,342
Nope.

1642
01:24:39,426 --> 01:24:40,844
It's a beautiful day, Suzette.

1643
01:24:40,927 --> 01:24:42,220
He could be anyplace.

1644
01:24:42,345 --> 01:24:43,722
- No. Something's wrong.
- What?

1645
01:24:43,847 --> 01:24:45,390
I feel it.

1646
01:24:49,144 --> 01:24:51,521
Oh!

1647
01:24:51,646 --> 01:24:55,025
Oh, Vin, the typewriter's
at the bottom of the pool.

1648
01:24:55,108 --> 01:24:56,526
What?

1649
01:24:56,610 --> 01:24:58,320
The gun.
He must have taken his gun.

1650
01:24:58,445 --> 01:25:00,447
Harry has a gun?

1651
01:25:00,530 --> 01:25:03,283
Yeah. With one bullet
intended for one person.

1652
01:25:03,367 --> 01:25:05,035
Who?

1653
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:07,120
His father.

1654
01:25:07,204 --> 01:25:08,705
He's gonna shoot his father?

1655
01:25:08,830 --> 01:25:11,249
Yes. I just...
Oh, man. I feel bad.

1656
01:25:11,375 --> 01:25:13,543
I called him,
I hung up, and I...

1657
01:25:13,668 --> 01:25:14,669
Suzette, Suzette,
Suzette, listen.

1658
01:25:14,795 --> 01:25:15,837
I just feel... Yeah.

1659
01:25:15,962 --> 01:25:17,422
Focus. Where is his father?

1660
01:25:17,547 --> 01:25:19,257
Uh, he's in an old-age home.

1661
01:25:19,383 --> 01:25:20,258
OK.

1662
01:25:20,384 --> 01:25:22,302
It's like
something something.

1663
01:25:22,386 --> 01:25:24,054
It was like
something, something.

1664
01:25:24,179 --> 01:25:25,555
Something.
All right, focus.

1665
01:25:25,639 --> 01:25:26,723
Something...
Horizon something.

1666
01:25:26,848 --> 01:25:27,891
Horizon Hills?

1667
01:25:28,016 --> 01:25:30,143
That's it. Horizon Hills.
Do you know it?

1668
01:25:30,227 --> 01:25:31,603
Yeah.

1669
01:25:31,728 --> 01:25:33,105
Well, let's go, man.

1670
01:25:33,230 --> 01:25:36,358
But it's not
an old-age home.

1671
01:25:46,410 --> 01:25:48,286
What's your take on him, Vin?

1672
01:25:48,412 --> 01:25:49,830
The gun thing's tricky.

1673
01:25:49,913 --> 01:25:51,957
Oh, man.
What am I gonna do?

1674
01:25:52,082 --> 01:25:54,626
How am I gonna talk him
out of it?

1675
01:25:54,751 --> 01:25:56,461
You'll figure it out.

1676
01:25:56,586 --> 01:25:59,923
Just stay calm, rational.

1677
01:26:00,048 --> 01:26:01,258
Yeah.

1678
01:26:05,721 --> 01:26:07,681
You lied to me, Harry.

1679
01:26:07,764 --> 01:26:10,392
And you told me to stay out
of your way, remember?

1680
01:26:10,475 --> 01:26:11,852
Get in the car.

1681
01:26:11,935 --> 01:26:13,770
It's between me and him.

1682
01:26:13,895 --> 01:26:16,398
But he's already dead,
you lunatic.

1683
01:26:16,523 --> 01:26:18,567
No, he isn't.
He's in here.

1684
01:26:18,692 --> 01:26:19,776
What?

1685
01:26:19,901 --> 01:26:20,944
In here.

1686
01:26:22,446 --> 01:26:24,489
Why do you still blame him?

1687
01:26:24,614 --> 01:26:26,616
You know what kind
of father I had.

1688
01:26:26,742 --> 01:26:28,618
When I was 4, I'd feel...

1689
01:26:28,744 --> 01:26:29,745
Fuck 4.

1690
01:26:29,870 --> 01:26:31,705
My whole childhood,
he was never there.

1691
01:26:31,788 --> 01:26:33,999
I went to bed every night
without a dad to tuck me in.

1692
01:26:34,124 --> 01:26:35,792
You know how damaging
that can be?

1693
01:26:35,917 --> 01:26:37,794
It's too bad you didn't
know me back then...

1694
01:26:37,919 --> 01:26:39,796
because I could have
sent my father over...

1695
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:41,715
and he could
have tucked you in.

1696
01:26:41,798 --> 01:26:43,341
He hated me,
thought I was worthless...

1697
01:26:43,467 --> 01:26:44,593
criticized everything I did.

1698
01:26:44,718 --> 01:26:46,136
For heaven's sakes.

1699
01:26:58,899 --> 01:27:00,484
You ran me over.

1700
01:27:00,609 --> 01:27:02,903
Someone had to.
Did you hear yourself?

1701
01:27:02,986 --> 01:27:05,572
You don't run over a person!

1702
01:27:05,655 --> 01:27:07,449
Harry, we were only going
2 miles an hour.

1703
01:27:07,574 --> 01:27:08,658
What's the problem?

1704
01:27:08,784 --> 01:27:10,660
You were gonna kill
yourself anyway, right?

1705
01:27:10,744 --> 01:27:11,828
Harry, come on.

1706
01:27:11,953 --> 01:27:13,246
You're both insane.

1707
01:27:13,330 --> 01:27:14,373
So true.

1708
01:27:14,498 --> 01:27:16,541
I got it. I got it.

1709
01:27:16,666 --> 01:27:17,876
Give me that.

1710
01:27:22,339 --> 01:27:23,924
What are you gonna do?

1711
01:27:24,007 --> 01:27:26,385
I'm gonna help you, Harry.

1712
01:27:34,518 --> 01:27:35,435
Jesus.

1713
01:27:43,151 --> 01:27:44,694
That was your one bullet.

1714
01:27:57,666 --> 01:28:00,168
Go forgive him, Harry.

1715
01:28:03,046 --> 01:28:05,674
You're here.
You might as well talk to him.

1716
01:28:52,888 --> 01:28:54,931
Dad?

1717
01:28:55,057 --> 01:28:59,936
Dad?

1718
01:29:02,105 --> 01:29:03,190
Hmm.

1719
01:29:11,573 --> 01:29:13,784
Come on, Suzette.
Hurry up.

1720
01:29:15,410 --> 01:29:16,286
Hurry, hurry!

1721
01:29:16,411 --> 01:29:17,287
I'm coming, I'm coming.

1722
01:29:17,412 --> 01:29:19,289
They may have
already started.

1723
01:29:19,373 --> 01:29:20,457
Hi.

1724
01:29:28,715 --> 01:29:29,800
Come on.

1725
01:29:32,135 --> 01:29:33,637
Come on.

1726
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:35,138
Suzette, come on.
You, too.

1727
01:29:35,263 --> 01:29:36,765
Come on. Come on...

1728
01:29:36,848 --> 01:29:38,433
come on.

1729
01:29:38,558 --> 01:29:40,102
Put your shoes on, honey.

1730
01:29:40,227 --> 01:29:41,311
Yeah. Wait. Wait.
Where are you going? Come on.

1731
01:29:41,436 --> 01:29:43,438
Come on. You got it? Good.

1732
01:29:43,563 --> 01:29:46,149
How about the other one?
You look great.

1733
01:29:50,445 --> 01:29:51,947
I hate feeling fake...

1734
01:29:52,072 --> 01:29:53,740
more than anything
in the world.

1735
01:29:53,824 --> 01:29:56,076
You wouldn't believe
what people tell you...

1736
01:29:56,159 --> 01:29:58,787
"You got to get into college.
You got to figure out...

1737
01:29:58,912 --> 01:30:01,123
what you're gonna do.
You got to make money."

1738
01:30:01,248 --> 01:30:02,332
And we're going...

1739
01:30:02,457 --> 01:30:05,127
"My God, I feel like
I'm still a kid practically."

1740
01:30:05,210 --> 01:30:07,921
But your teachers and your parents
and everybody's got...

1741
01:30:08,004 --> 01:30:10,632
everything all planned out
for you with high expectations.

1742
01:30:10,757 --> 01:30:14,970
But what if it has
nothing to do with you?

1743
01:30:16,722 --> 01:30:19,141
You lose track of yourself.

1744
01:30:21,518 --> 01:30:23,353
And that's fake.

1745
01:30:26,231 --> 01:30:28,066
We're going into the future.

1746
01:30:28,191 --> 01:30:31,528
And I only have little clues
as to what might be out there.

1747
01:30:31,611 --> 01:30:33,822
Sometimes,
I'm scared to death.

1748
01:30:33,905 --> 01:30:36,908
Sometimes,
I'm really excited.

1749
01:30:37,034 --> 01:30:40,370
And I just wish for
everybody in my class...

1750
01:30:40,454 --> 01:30:43,498
no, for everybody...
That whatever you do...

1751
01:30:43,623 --> 01:30:45,333
you do it true...

1752
01:30:45,417 --> 01:30:47,169
even if you mess up...

1753
01:30:47,294 --> 01:30:49,087
even if you fail.

1754
01:30:49,212 --> 01:30:52,299
I'd rather fail
doing my own thing...

1755
01:30:52,382 --> 01:30:54,342
doing what I want to do...

1756
01:30:54,426 --> 01:30:57,220
than doing what somebody else
wants me to do and succeeding.

1757
01:30:58,889 --> 01:31:03,018
I'd rather be fighting
with my family...

1758
01:31:03,143 --> 01:31:05,771
than... pretending it's all OK.

1759
01:31:07,773 --> 01:31:12,944
To the graduating class
of 2002... go.

1760
01:31:13,070 --> 01:31:15,489
Go into the world
and do it true.

1761
01:31:15,572 --> 01:31:17,908
Do it true.

1762
01:31:28,418 --> 01:31:29,711
Woo!

1763
01:31:54,611 --> 01:31:55,696
Honey, you rocked.

1764
01:31:55,779 --> 01:31:57,739
Now we're gonna
go back to the house.

1765
01:31:57,823 --> 01:31:59,741
And why don't you follow
us in your car, OK?

1766
01:31:59,825 --> 01:32:01,118
No. I'm gonna take off.

1767
01:32:01,243 --> 01:32:03,286
Yeah, I got stuff to do.

1768
01:32:03,412 --> 01:32:05,789
But I've got to give you
back your clothes.

1769
01:32:05,914 --> 01:32:07,332
That's all right.
Hold onto them.

1770
01:32:07,457 --> 01:32:08,917
It'll give me an excuse
to see you again.

1771
01:32:09,042 --> 01:32:11,586
You don't need an excuse.

1772
01:32:14,715 --> 01:32:16,216
We had a blast.

1773
01:32:16,299 --> 01:32:18,135
Yeah.

1774
01:32:18,260 --> 01:32:20,137
Mom! Oh, my God, you guys.

1775
01:32:20,262 --> 01:32:21,263
What?

1776
01:32:21,388 --> 01:32:22,848
I am so in love.

1777
01:32:22,973 --> 01:32:24,182
Who? With who?

1778
01:32:24,307 --> 01:32:27,060
Shh. He's right...
He's right there.

1779
01:32:27,144 --> 01:32:29,896
Wait, wait, wait.
Not him, not him.

1780
01:32:29,980 --> 01:32:31,565
There he is. That's him.

1781
01:32:33,483 --> 01:32:34,651
Musicians.

1782
01:32:34,776 --> 01:32:36,653
Yeah.

1783
01:33:21,323 --> 01:33:22,407
Hey, Suzette.

1784
01:33:22,532 --> 01:33:23,992
Yeah?

1785
01:33:24,076 --> 01:33:26,036
Do you want to hear a story
that I've been writing?

1786
01:33:26,161 --> 01:33:27,871
Yeah. Tell.

1787
01:33:27,996 --> 01:33:30,624
Well, it's about this guy...

1788
01:33:30,707 --> 01:33:33,293
who's complicated...

1789
01:33:33,377 --> 01:33:36,421
and he meets
this woman who's...

1790
01:33:39,049 --> 01:33:40,467
she's...

1791
01:33:40,550 --> 01:33:43,303
