But it doesn't work.
I mean, you think it works

379

a bowel movement?

00:26:48,975 --> 00:26:50,409
Yep.

505
00:26:50,476 --> 00:26:54,546
Oh, my god. Is that really you?

506
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,048
Yeah.

507
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:58,751
Well, no. I mean,
the tits aren't me.

508
00:26:58,818 --> 00:27:00,452
They, um... they're fake,

509
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:02,955
but in here somewhere, it's me!

510
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,758
What are you doing here?

511
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:08,027
I... i brought Hannah home.

512
00:27:08,094 --> 00:27:08,995
My daughter?

513
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:12,331
Yeah. She's ok. She's in bed.

514
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:15,868
No, she is not.

515
00:27:15,935 --> 00:27:18,204
She is not in bed.
It's her prom night,

516
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,381
and she was going
to spend the night

517
00:27:19,405 --> 00:27:20,707
with Carol bishop.

518
00:27:20,773 --> 00:27:23,943
No, vin. She's in bed. Go look.

519
00:27:26,045 --> 00:27:28,815
Why would you be
bringing her home?

520
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:30,282
'Cause they were partying,

521
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:33,452
you know, at the hotel
that I'm staying at,

522
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:35,788
and she needed
a ride home, so...

523
00:27:35,855 --> 00:27:38,290
I gave her one.

524
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:39,826
That doesn't make sense.

525
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:41,694
You're leaving something out...

526
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:43,529
Like what about the...

527
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:45,798
Jules, her date?

528
00:27:45,865 --> 00:27:47,767
I don't know. I mean,
they kind of went off,

529
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:50,202
I guess, with the other
kids or something.

530
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:51,980
You know, you're making me
really nervous, vin.

531
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:54,173
I mean, I'm just, like...
I'm freaking out here, man.

532
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,811
I mean, aren't you,
like, glad to see me?

533
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,853
Suzette, what is it
that you want?

534
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:09,021
Who said I wanted anything?

535
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,123
You just show up
here out of the blue

536
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,359
in Phoenix, 16 years later?

537
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:15,394
20.

538
00:28:15,461 --> 00:28:17,296
Or 20.

539
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:19,431
You want money.

540
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:20,833
Who told you that?

541
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,434
I'm asking you.

542
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:23,836
That I want money?

543
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:25,637
That is so fucked up!

544
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,539
Shh!

545
00:28:27,606 --> 00:28:30,576
I mean, my being in Phoenix
has nothing to do with you.

546
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,879
Are you telling me the truth?

547
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:35,014
No. Shit. Ok, Vinnie. Hold on.

548
00:28:35,081 --> 00:28:37,016
I got fired from my job.

549
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:40,853
What did you tell my daughter?

550
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,422
I named every guy
you ever rattled.

551
00:28:43,489 --> 00:28:44,924
That is not funny, suzette.

552
00:28:44,991 --> 00:28:48,160
She didn't even know
who I was, Vinnie.

553
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:49,628
Of course not.

554
00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:51,239
My husband, my children,
my community...

555
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:53,032
They don't know anything
about that period

556
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:54,801

I associated with then,

No longer a part
of my current reality.

Oh, fuck your current reality.

00:29:07,814 --> 00:29:10,116
I mean, look at you
with your pools

563
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:11,918
and your fountains.
I mean, come on, Vinnie.

564
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:13,786
Don't call me Vinnie.
Nobody calls me that.

565
00:29:13,853 --> 00:29:15,354
My name is lavinia.

Vinnie.

567
00:29:16,722 --> 00:29:18,858
All right. I will
give you $5,000

568
00:29:18,925 --> 00:29:20,492
to get out of my life.

569
00:29:22,161 --> 00:29:24,763
I didn't come here
to harangue you.

570
00:29:24,831 --> 00:29:27,399
Harass. Whatever.

571
00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:30,102
You are so uptight.

00:29:31,637 --> 00:29:33,505
So uptight.

00:29:34,974 --> 00:29:37,509
I'm not uptight.

574
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:38,878
I just brought the kid home

575
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:40,546
because she needed a ride,

576
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,815
and she did. She needed a ride.

Suzette, I am not
without gratitude.

But that girl is
on the Dean's list.

She's going to
vassar in the fall.

580
00:29:50,857 --> 00:29:51,924
She's the valedictorian

581

of her graduating class.

582
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,361
I get it.

00:29:56,929 --> 00:29:58,530
Don't worry.

584
00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:00,799
I didn't tell her anything.

to sleep after this.

596

I'm going to ask you something,

and I won't tolerate
anything but the truth.

598

Did you do drugs
at the prom last night?

What are you talking about?

00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:54,520
Did you do drugs?

601

I stupidly had 2 kinds...
Red and white...

605

I didn't even know that
till after.

00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,428
At least you have integrity.

670
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,902
Yeah. Integrity...

671
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:05,537
And I'm broke.

672
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:07,306
Oh! Ooh!

673
00:35:07,373 --> 00:35:09,275
Ptoo! I got something...

674
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:10,409
You want water?

675
00:35:10,476 --> 00:35:12,244
No, don't dote on me, Harry.

676
00:35:12,311 --> 00:35:14,180
Actually, I do want
some water, please.

677
00:35:14,246 --> 00:35:16,482
[Telephone ringing]

678
00:35:16,548 --> 00:35:18,617
Who the hell knows I'm here?

679
00:35:18,684 --> 00:35:21,553
I don't know.
The hotel, for a start.

680
00:35:26,225 --> 00:35:28,860
Answer the phone, Harry.

681
00:35:31,997 --> 00:35:35,934
Hello? Yes.

682
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:37,536
Uh, yes.

683
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:43,509
No. Sure. Please come up.

684
00:35:43,575 --> 00:35:45,777
Room 1007.

685
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:47,746
Who was that?

686
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:49,114
Lavinia.

687
00:35:49,181 --> 00:35:50,716
What?!

688
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,085
She said she needs to see you.

689
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,721
Oh, my god!

690
00:35:55,787 --> 00:35:57,323
After all I told you,

691
00:35:57,389 --> 00:35:59,258
you think I want her
coming up here?

692
00:35:59,325 --> 00:36:00,702
I just followed
my instincts, suzette.

693
00:36:00,726 --> 00:36:02,127
You're not following
your instincts,

694
00:36:02,194 --> 00:36:04,996
you're following hers!
She manipulates people!

695
00:36:05,063 --> 00:36:07,833
I hate you right now, Harry!

696
00:36:09,568 --> 00:36:10,769
Oh, god.

697
00:36:18,877 --> 00:36:20,078
Lavinia Kingsley.

698
00:36:20,145 --> 00:36:21,547
Harry plummer.

699
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:23,515
Suzette's just wiping herself...

700
00:36:23,582 --> 00:36:25,984
Drying herself off.
She had a bath.

701
00:36:26,051 --> 00:36:27,453
Oh.

702
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:29,120
I don't want to interrupt...

703
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,656
Something.

704
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:33,091
No, no, no. Please
come in, Mrs. Kingsley.

705
00:36:33,158 --> 00:36:34,293
Thank you, Mr. plummer.

706
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,894
I'll just be
2 seconds, really...

707
00:36:35,961 --> 00:36:37,363
You better be here to apologize

708
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:39,598
because you treated me
like the scum of the earth,

709
00:36:39,665 --> 00:36:41,367
and if you think
those flowers are going

710
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:43,110
to make me feel better,
you're sadly mistaken.

711
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:44,736
I'm going to smoke,
Harry. Endure it.

712
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:46,738
You have every right
to be offended,

713
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:48,139
and I do apologize.

714
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,242
That is why I am here.

715
00:37:00,018 --> 00:37:01,920
Will you join me for lunch

716
00:37:01,987 --> 00:37:03,522
tomorrow afternoon?

717
00:37:05,457 --> 00:37:08,159
And what will happen
at lunch, lavinia?

718
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,828
Well, I would like
the opportunity

719
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:12,764
to explain to you why
I'm no longer the person

720
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:14,232
that I was years ago,

721
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,810
how I've changed... for
the better, I think...

722
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:18,103
And the direction that
my life has gone in.

723
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:19,004
For instance,
I'm very much involved

724
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,071
in charity work,

725
00:37:20,138 --> 00:37:21,573
and there's actually
a tree planted

726
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,141
near city hall
with my name on it

727
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:24,443
right here in Phoenix...

728
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:25,911
Phoenix being the mythical bird

729
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:27,178
that Rose from the ashes...

730
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,447
I, too, have become someone

731
00:37:28,514 --> 00:37:29,715
that you don't know, suzette.

732
00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:31,182
And I would like the opportunity

733
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,951
to introduce myself to you.

734
00:37:33,018 --> 00:37:34,386
People do change, suzette.

735
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:36,722
Not that it's been easy.
It hasn't been.

736
00:37:36,788 --> 00:37:39,525
But I could not be
the person that I was

737
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:41,126
because the person that I was

738
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:42,861
is not the person that I am.

739
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:44,896
Vinnie, stop, ok?
'Cause you're going

740
00:37:44,963 --> 00:37:46,365
right up your own asshole,

741
00:37:46,432 --> 00:37:48,367
and I don't feel like following.

742
00:37:48,434 --> 00:37:50,302
I know what she means, though.

743
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:52,304
Why, thank you.

744
00:37:52,371 --> 00:37:54,172
Harry, enough.

745
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:56,442
Vinnie, I'm not
ashamed of my past.

746
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:58,043
At least I'm not walking around

747
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,378
in some Lance robe and slippers

748
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:00,946
pretending that
it never happened.

749
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:02,614
My husband is a lawyer!

750
00:38:02,681 --> 00:38:04,683
Oh, yeah? What are you
going to do, sue me?

751
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,552
Could you just
let me finish, please?

752
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:08,587
And he aspires
to a career in politics.

753
00:38:08,654 --> 00:38:10,456
Hey. The first lady of the land

754
00:38:10,522 --> 00:38:12,358
is going to be a banger sister?

755
00:38:12,424 --> 00:38:13,359
I am not a banger sister!

756
00:38:13,425 --> 00:38:15,160
Look, I am a mother,

757
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:16,895
and I am a very good mother.

758
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:18,764
Hannah told me everything

759
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,231
about what happened at the prom.

760
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,533
She told me that she drank

761
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,010
red and white wine,
and the combination

762
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:24,403
of the two made her queasy.

763
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,204
Queasy? She was
really out of it,

764
00:38:26,271 --> 00:38:27,373
Mrs. Kingsley.

765
00:38:27,439 --> 00:38:28,540
Wasn't she, suzette?

766
00:38:28,607 --> 00:38:29,908
Oh, I don't think so, Harry.

767
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:32,310
She would have told
her mother everything.

768
00:38:32,378 --> 00:38:35,947
So, what time's lunch?

769
00:38:36,014 --> 00:38:37,983
I beg your pardon?

770
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:39,718
Yeah. We're going to lunch.

771
00:38:39,785 --> 00:38:41,052
You said.

772
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,188
Oh. Yeah, but I have just

773
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:44,956
said everything that I planned

774
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:46,825
to say at lunch.

775
00:38:46,892 --> 00:38:49,227
You know, where I
come from, lavinia...

776
00:38:49,294 --> 00:38:51,196
Which, granted, is a hellhole

777
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:52,598
in west Hollywood...

778
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:55,300
The people go on and on and on
and on about themselves

779
00:38:55,367 --> 00:38:56,702
all day long.

780
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,637
They at least have the decency

781
00:38:58,704 --> 00:39:00,171
to ask the other person,

782
00:39:00,238 --> 00:39:03,174
"so, what's new with you?"

783
00:39:03,241 --> 00:39:04,810
Noon, in the lobby?

784
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:06,478
Look, suzette, I am
not self-indulgent.

785
00:39:06,545 --> 00:39:08,246
I may be a lot of things,

786
00:39:08,313 --> 00:39:10,649
but that is one thing
that I am not.

787
00:39:10,716 --> 00:39:13,952
Then why are you still
talking about yourself?

788
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:14,820
[Door opens]

789
00:39:14,886 --> 00:39:16,287
And by the way, how did you know

790
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,856
what room I was staying in?

791
00:39:17,923 --> 00:39:20,726
Oh, I described you to
the clerk at the desk.

792
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:25,397
Ugh! "I described you
to the clerk at the desk."

793
00:39:25,464 --> 00:39:27,666
I got to get some drinks in her

794
00:39:27,733 --> 00:39:30,235
and get her mojo going, man.

795
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:31,803
But first, I got to crash.

796
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,238
Oh, I'm so tired.

797
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:35,474
Oh, yeah. This is good.

798
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:49,621
Harry?

799
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,559
What did he do to you...
Your father...

800
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:55,694
To make you love him so much?

801
00:39:57,763 --> 00:40:00,165
He put a kind of curse on me.

802
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:03,735
How'd he do that?

803
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,305
We had a family business

804
00:40:07,372 --> 00:40:09,441
selling furniture. I hated it.

805
00:40:09,508 --> 00:40:11,376
I wanted to be a writer.

806
00:40:11,443 --> 00:40:13,011
He hated that.

807
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:14,446
"Go ahead," he said.

808
00:40:14,513 --> 00:40:16,047
"Everything you touch

809
00:40:16,114 --> 00:40:18,049
"is going to turn to shit.

810
00:40:18,116 --> 00:40:19,485
"You'll look back someday,

811
00:40:19,551 --> 00:40:22,187
and there'll be
nothing to look at."

812
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,490
Well, you took off anyway, see?

813
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:25,991
I like that.

814
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:30,128
And then you blew
into Hollywood?

815
00:40:30,195 --> 00:40:31,663
Yeah.

816
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:34,900
It was great.

817
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:37,769
The whole world
wanted a piece of me.

818
00:40:37,836 --> 00:40:40,639
You know, everybody
was jumping into bed

819
00:40:40,706 --> 00:40:43,575
with everybody
back in those days.

820
00:40:43,642 --> 00:40:46,411
I had a dodge duster.

821
00:40:46,478 --> 00:40:50,448
Every Friday night,
I'd eat at Joe Allen's.

822
00:40:50,516 --> 00:40:52,918
God, it was fabulous.

823
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:54,920
You mean, you drove?

824
00:40:57,823 --> 00:41:00,992
Gold dodge duster
with white vinyl seats.

825
00:41:04,429 --> 00:41:06,532
Did you have a girlfriend?

826
00:41:08,033 --> 00:41:09,535
Yeah.

827
00:41:09,601 --> 00:41:11,202
What happened?

828
00:41:12,638 --> 00:41:14,205
Everything fell to pieces

829
00:41:14,272 --> 00:41:16,041
just the way he said it would.

830
00:41:16,107 --> 00:41:18,409
Well, come on. You're
giving the old man

831
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,478
too much credit.

832
00:41:20,546 --> 00:41:22,447
You're not selling furniture.

833
00:41:22,514 --> 00:41:24,850
Is he still doing that?

834
00:41:24,916 --> 00:41:26,217
No.

835
00:41:27,919 --> 00:41:30,021
He's...

836
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:32,323
He's at some place

837
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:34,359
called horizon hills.

838
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:36,962
It's a retirement community.

839
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:51,777
Don't move.

840
00:41:53,979 --> 00:41:56,782
You can do whatever you want,

841
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:59,517
but you're not allowed to think.

842
00:42:08,493 --> 00:42:10,662
You're thinking, Harry.

843
00:42:12,598 --> 00:42:14,032
I'm terrified.

844
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:15,333
Shut up.

845
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,768
Ok.

846
00:42:34,753 --> 00:42:37,923
Good morning... Mrs. plummer.

847
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:40,792
Hey, you've got 2 things
going for you.

848
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:42,227
One is that I'm in a good mood,

849
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:43,995
and two is that you're cute.

850
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:47,899
Oh, suzette.

851
00:42:47,966 --> 00:42:49,935
I came to apologize in person.

852
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:51,737
I completely forgot
about ginger.

853
00:42:51,803 --> 00:42:52,947
She's taking her
driver's test today.

854
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:54,606
Ginger? My 16-year-old.

855
00:42:54,673 --> 00:42:56,050
I can't tell you
how important this is.

856
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:57,575
I have to cancel lunch.
I apologize.

857
00:42:57,643 --> 00:42:58,710
This is for you.

858
00:42:58,777 --> 00:43:00,087
Are you trying
to weasel out of this?

859
00:43:00,111 --> 00:43:01,412
No! This is one

860
00:43:01,479 --> 00:43:02,724
of those rites
of passage moments.

861
00:43:02,748 --> 00:43:04,182
I have to be there.

862
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:06,251
Well, I'll go with you.

863
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:07,853
Oh.

864
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:10,421
Mom, what are you doing?

865
00:43:10,488 --> 00:43:12,257
Nothing.

866
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:14,325
Who's that?

867
00:43:14,392 --> 00:43:16,628
Suzette, my friend.

868
00:43:16,695 --> 00:43:19,364
Your friend?

869
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,507
All right. Just get in the car.

870
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:22,467
I'll be there in a minute.

871
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:24,202
No, you're not ditching me.

872
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:25,403
You made a date,

873
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:27,072
and I got all dressed up.

874
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:34,379
Ok. I just have
to get organized.

875
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,614
Excuse me. Hi. Would you please

876
00:43:36,682 --> 00:43:38,183
take this up to room 1007?

877
00:43:38,249 --> 00:43:39,617
And don't water it.

878
00:43:39,685 --> 00:43:41,052
It doesn't need watering.

879
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,520
They've already been watered,

880
00:43:42,587 --> 00:43:44,055
so you don't have to water them.

881
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:45,356
Come on. Let's go.

882
00:43:45,423 --> 00:43:48,026
Don't water them. Please.

883
00:43:48,093 --> 00:43:50,896
Ok. In case you'd noticed,

884
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:52,206
there's one other thing.
You probably won't.

885
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:54,132
But ginger has
just a little habit of...

886
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:55,576
She makes a little
noise in the back

887
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,736
of her throat sometimes,

888
00:43:57,803 --> 00:43:59,046
and the specialists
say it's nothing.

889
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:00,538
It's probably going to dissolve

890
00:44:00,605 --> 00:44:02,107
in a matter of time, and then...

891
00:44:02,173 --> 00:44:02,974
Great. Yeah.

892
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:04,175
But our policy is just to...

893
00:44:04,242 --> 00:44:06,211
It's just... we're
going to ignore it.

I wanted a tattoo, mom,
but you said I couldn't.

897
00:44:13,885 --> 00:44:16,221
Just stay in your Lane, honey.

898
00:44:16,287 --> 00:44:17,823
Is her tongue pierced?

899
00:44:17,889 --> 00:44:19,524
Sweetheart, it's
not nice to talk

900
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,259
about people in front of them

901
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:22,761
as if they're not there.

902
00:44:22,828 --> 00:44:24,205
I know someone who
had her labia pierced.

903
00:44:24,229 --> 00:44:26,164
All right, concentrate
on your driving, gin.

904
00:44:26,231 --> 00:44:27,742
And I better not get
the guy Jennifer got.

905
00:44:27,766 --> 00:44:29,034
He failed her for talking.

906
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,812
All right. Well, don't
talk, then. Just drive.

907
00:44:30,836 --> 00:44:32,203
That's the way accidents happen.

908
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:33,839
From talking?
I don't think so, mom.

909
00:44:33,905 --> 00:44:35,173
Stay in your Lane.

910
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,875
What Lane are you referring to?

911
00:44:36,942 --> 00:44:38,076
The Lane that you're in!

912
00:44:38,143 --> 00:44:39,721
Well, if I'm in it,
then what's the problem?

913
00:44:39,745 --> 00:44:41,088
Will you look where
you're driving?!

[Breathing deeply]

916
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:48,086
It's always been
much harder with ginger

917
00:44:48,153 --> 00:44:49,955
than with Hannah
because Hannah tends

918
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:51,823
to be solution-oriented,
whereas ginger...

919
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:53,959
Well, she's artistic,
which is, of course,

920
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:56,394
what I love about her
and always want

921
00:44:56,461 --> 00:44:59,164
to encourage, but she
does tend to be defiant.

922
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:01,432
You didn't name her
after ginger Baker,

923
00:45:01,499 --> 00:45:02,768
did you? No.

924
00:45:02,834 --> 00:45:04,435
I was pregnant
and craving ginger,

925
00:45:04,502 --> 00:45:06,171
so I ate it every day.

926
00:45:06,237 --> 00:45:07,538
Oh. Way better.

927
00:45:07,605 --> 00:45:09,374
Gosh. What time is it?

928
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,508
I don't know.

929
00:45:10,575 --> 00:45:11,743
Course you don't.

930
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:13,544
Oh, gosh, I hope
she passes this thing.

931
00:45:13,611 --> 00:45:14,913
It's going to be so good

932
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,614
for her self-esteem.

933

You know that guy Harry...
The guy you met?

He doesn't drive.

He might now, though,

936
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:23,588
'cause we had sex last night.

937
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:26,224
First time in 10 years
for that guy.

938
00:45:26,291 --> 00:45:28,359
I kind of liked it,
though, you know?

939
00:45:28,426 --> 00:45:30,228
I felt like I was
accomplishing something.

940

Boy, when he came,
it was like somebody

941

in an electric chair.

in a relationship...

The two of you.

No, no. I just picked him up,

945

like, somewhere in blythe,

946
00:45:40,638 --> 00:45:43,374
and he's not
a bad rattle, though.

the way that you've
put yourself together,

that's... obviously, you're trying

you know, flash them,

those tits,

00:53:23,167 --> 00:53:24,635
What's your problem?

1161
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:26,337
[Sigh]

1162
00:53:26,404 --> 00:53:28,273
Mom caught me in the pool

1163
00:53:28,339 --> 00:53:29,840
with Jules.

1164
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:34,812
So?

1165
00:53:36,781 --> 00:53:39,650
We weren't swimming.

1166
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:41,085
Eww.

1167
00:53:41,151 --> 00:53:42,553
Your own mother?

1168
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:44,289
Shut up. It was horrible.

1169
00:53:44,355 --> 00:53:46,257
She stood there and made us

1170
00:53:46,324 --> 00:53:47,858
get out of the pool.

1171
00:53:47,925 --> 00:53:49,260
It was so embarrassing.

1172
00:53:49,327 --> 00:53:50,628
It's the worst thing

1173
00:53:50,695 --> 00:53:52,363
that's ever happened to me.

1174
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:54,131
I failed my driving test.

1175
00:53:54,198 --> 00:53:56,133
You're allowed to fail. I'm not.

1176
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,669
I don't even know
what it feels like.

1177
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:00,905
Look at me. Look. Look at this.

1178
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:03,708
I'm on every single page
of this yearbook.

1179
00:54:03,774 --> 00:54:05,242
Ugh!

1180
00:54:07,712 --> 00:54:09,280
And tomorrow, I'm expected

1181
00:54:09,347 --> 00:54:11,649
to get up in front
of the entire school

1182
00:54:11,716 --> 00:54:13,284
and say something profound

1183
00:54:13,351 --> 00:54:15,353
so that all the grads
will run off

1184
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:16,987
into the future

1185
00:54:17,054 --> 00:54:19,056
and live happily ever after...

1186
00:54:19,123 --> 00:54:21,191
Such a lie.

1187
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:23,994
I wish I could just
get up there and fart.

1188
00:54:24,061 --> 00:54:25,296
Ha!

1189
00:54:25,363 --> 00:54:26,764
Why don't you?

1190
00:54:26,831 --> 00:54:28,299
Yeah, right.

1191
00:54:28,366 --> 00:54:30,668
All my teachers,
the head of school,

1192
00:54:30,735 --> 00:54:32,703
dad, mom...

1193
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:35,172
Especially mom...

1194
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:38,275
Can you imagine her reaction?

1195
00:54:41,446 --> 00:54:43,714
Well, at least
it wouldn't be boring.

1196

from failure to failure

Winston Churchill.

1199
00:54:57,328 --> 00:54:58,929
But what if the person
testing you

1200
00:54:58,996 --> 00:55:01,466
has such bad body odor,
you can't even concentrate?

1201
00:55:01,532 --> 00:55:04,001
Red light means stop, ginger.

1202
00:55:04,068 --> 00:55:06,070
New topic. Hannah...

1203
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,872
How's your speech coming?

1204
00:55:07,938 --> 00:55:09,683
I'm thinking of doing
something unconventional.

1205
00:55:09,707 --> 00:55:12,109
Well, that's always a good idea.

1206
00:55:12,176 --> 00:55:14,645
If it were always a good idea,

1207
00:55:14,712 --> 00:55:16,447
it wouldn't be unconventional.

1208
00:55:16,514 --> 00:55:17,915
You're going to do fine.

1209
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:20,017
You look great.
You have a lot of color

1210
00:55:20,084 --> 00:55:21,419
in your face.

1211
00:55:21,486 --> 00:55:23,954
Have you been out
in the sun today?

1212
00:55:24,021 --> 00:55:25,823
Yeah, Hannah.

Suzette?

1218

Mm-hmm?

1219
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:41,806
You knew my wife before I did...

1220
00:55:41,872 --> 00:55:44,742
Actually, before all of us did.

1221
00:55:44,809 --> 00:55:47,912
Has she changed
over all these years?

1222
00:55:49,747 --> 00:55:51,882
I see the same person.

1223

[Laughs]

1224

What do the two of you
have in common?

1225
00:55:56,787 --> 00:55:59,724
What do we have in common, vin?

1226
00:56:01,592 --> 00:56:05,763
We, uh, went to
the occasional concert.

1227
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:07,031
Yeah.

1228
00:56:07,097 --> 00:56:08,365
Yeah.

1229
00:56:08,433 --> 00:56:10,901
Hmm. What kind of concerts?

1230
00:56:10,968 --> 00:56:13,471
Rock.

1231
00:56:13,538 --> 00:56:14,839
It had to be
really rock, though.

1232
00:56:14,905 --> 00:56:15,840
Didn't it, babe?

1233

We had very high standards.

She danced.

That's what she did. She danced.

really, really bad dancer.

on its head. Anybody?

Hmm?

I have no idea.

1263

"Mr. mojo risin',"

which were the letters
of his name scrambled up.

1267
