354
00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:51,032
No. Please.
Stay away from me.

355
00:20:51,162 --> 00:20:53,295
I-I don't do things suddenly.

356
00:20:53,426 --> 00:20:55,079
I like to think first,

357
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,386
and you're too... too...

358
00:20:57,778 --> 00:20:58,735
Too what?

359
00:21:01,825 --> 00:21:02,826
Sudden.

360
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:08,615
All right.
I'll leave you alone.

361
00:21:09,442 --> 00:21:10,269
[sighs]

362
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:11,618
But I got to sleep for a bit.

363
00:21:12,358 --> 00:21:13,489
Sleep where?

364
00:21:15,012 --> 00:21:16,492
In your environment.

365
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,931
What about your friend, Vinnie?

366
00:21:21,062 --> 00:21:23,107
Oh, I don't know
what I was thinking.

367
00:21:28,504 --> 00:21:29,940
[shower running]

368
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,725
Oh.

369
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:40,647
[bathroom door opens]

370
00:21:40,777 --> 00:21:41,996
You got enough vitamins, Harry?

371
00:21:42,126 --> 00:21:43,650
It looks like
a health food store in here.

372
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,868
[door closes]

373
00:21:48,437 --> 00:21:49,960
[dance music playing faintly]

374
00:22:18,511 --> 00:22:21,644
Hello. This is Harry Plummer
in 419 again.

375
00:22:21,775 --> 00:22:23,994
Is there any way I could move
to a room higher up?

376
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:27,346
Nothing at all?

377
00:22:27,476 --> 00:22:29,609
Well, is there any way
you can stop this racket?

378
00:22:33,221 --> 00:22:35,049
-[loud thud]
-[screaming]

379
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:37,573
What?

380
00:22:37,704 --> 00:22:38,487
You can't hear that?

381
00:22:38,618 --> 00:22:40,750
It's prom night out there.

382
00:22:40,881 --> 00:22:42,665
Don't know how you can
sleep through it.

383
00:22:42,796 --> 00:22:45,146
-Oh.
-My whole cycle
has been disrupted.

384
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,583
[sighs]

385
00:22:47,714 --> 00:22:49,324
Princess and the pea.

386
00:22:52,109 --> 00:22:54,634
Hey, man. Hey, guys.
Come on. Cool it.

387
00:22:54,764 --> 00:22:56,636
Hey, hey!

388
00:22:56,766 --> 00:22:58,725
Come on, man.
People are trying to sleep.

389
00:22:58,855 --> 00:23:00,422
MAN: Whoa! Oh!

390
00:23:02,468 --> 00:23:04,208
Oh, Hannah.

391
00:23:04,339 --> 00:23:05,601
-[Hannah groans softly]
-Hannah?

392
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,127
Hannah?

393
00:23:12,086 --> 00:23:13,740
Uh-oh. What's she on?

394
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,872
Nothing. We just
had champagne.

395
00:23:16,003 --> 00:23:17,352
Don't bullshit me.

396
00:23:17,483 --> 00:23:18,701
She's on acid.

397
00:23:20,486 --> 00:23:22,139
SUZETTE: Okay, just breathe.

398
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,315
Harry, get out of the way.

399
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:25,665
Out of the way.

400
00:23:25,795 --> 00:23:27,406
Somebody get
a wet towel, please.

401
00:23:28,232 --> 00:23:29,146
Is she gonna be okay?

402
00:23:29,277 --> 00:23:30,931
Yeah. Just get the towel.

403
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:32,367
Come on, honey.
Just breathe.

404
00:23:33,281 --> 00:23:34,761
Oh, when did she drop it?

405
00:23:35,631 --> 00:23:37,328
2 hours, maybe.

406
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:39,374
2 hours. Man, she's gonna be
really messed up.

407
00:23:39,505 --> 00:23:41,115
You guys should take off.

408
00:23:41,245 --> 00:23:43,726
No way.
Leave her here?

409
00:23:43,857 --> 00:23:45,206
Like, we don't even know you.

410
00:23:45,336 --> 00:23:46,903
I'm a friend
of her mother's.

411
00:23:47,034 --> 00:23:48,557
Ha! Yeah, right.

412
00:23:48,688 --> 00:23:50,080
Yeah. Hannah's mother?

413
00:23:51,168 --> 00:23:52,213
Are you kidding me?

414
00:23:52,343 --> 00:23:54,302
Lavinia Kingsley, handsome.

415
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,522
Now scram.

416
00:23:59,699 --> 00:24:00,787
Go on. Get out of here!

417
00:24:02,876 --> 00:24:04,834
-It's okay.
-WOMAN: She looks really sick.

418
00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:06,749
[Hannah groans]

419
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,229
Her mother is Vinnie?

420
00:24:09,709 --> 00:24:10,971
-[door closes]
-Yeah.

421
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:14,496
Oh.

422
00:24:14,627 --> 00:24:15,976
[sighs]

423
00:24:16,106 --> 00:24:17,499
-[whimpers]
-I know, honey.

424
00:24:18,674 --> 00:24:19,545
Just breathe.

425
00:24:19,675 --> 00:24:21,634
-[retching]
-Ooh, all right.

426
00:24:21,764 --> 00:24:23,026
-That's okay.
-[coughing]

427
00:24:23,157 --> 00:24:24,811
SUZETTE: That's okay.

428
00:24:24,941 --> 00:24:27,422
Oh, boy! That's it.
Let it go.

429
00:24:28,162 --> 00:24:29,511
Let it go.

430
00:24:29,642 --> 00:24:31,644
Just let it go, sweetie.
Just let it go.

431
00:24:31,774 --> 00:24:33,210
Ohh, there's another one!

432
00:24:33,341 --> 00:24:35,952
Oh, Harry.
You may never shit again.

433
00:24:37,258 --> 00:24:39,260
Okay. All right.

434
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,566
-[coughing]
-Good girl.

435
00:24:44,265 --> 00:24:45,571
-[sobbing]
-[shushing]

436
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:48,051
-Okay.
-Here.

437
00:24:48,182 --> 00:24:49,966
Oh, thank you.

438
00:24:50,097 --> 00:24:52,447
-[whimpering]
-[softly] It's all right, honey.

439
00:24:52,578 --> 00:24:55,363
Just think of a nice blue sky.

440
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,714
[coughing]

441
00:24:59,889 --> 00:25:01,108
HANNAH: Mom.

442
00:25:03,719 --> 00:25:05,416
SUZETTE: I'll get you home.
Don't worry.

443
00:25:05,939 --> 00:25:07,114
Just relax.

444
00:25:08,245 --> 00:25:09,769
You're gonna feel better now.

445
00:25:27,656 --> 00:25:28,875
[door closes]

446
00:25:35,272 --> 00:25:36,665
[sighs] Come on. Let's go.

447
00:25:37,187 --> 00:25:38,232
[groans]

448
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:40,974
Come on. Let's go.

449
00:25:47,371 --> 00:25:49,591
Down here,
to the kids' wing.

450
00:25:49,983 --> 00:25:51,288
What?

451
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:52,638
The kids' wing.

452
00:25:52,768 --> 00:25:53,813
The wing?

453
00:25:54,378 --> 00:25:55,379
Mm-hmm.

454
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:01,168
[barks]

455
00:26:01,734 --> 00:26:02,648
Barkley.

456
00:26:04,127 --> 00:26:04,998
Ba... [chuckles]

457
00:26:05,128 --> 00:26:06,695
[laughs] Okay.

458
00:26:06,826 --> 00:26:08,610
-Barkley.
-Hannah. Hannah.

459
00:26:08,741 --> 00:26:09,872
The dog, take the dog.

460
00:26:10,003 --> 00:26:11,004
-Barkley.
-The dog.

461
00:26:11,657 --> 00:26:12,614
Um...

462
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:16,270
have you talked to my mother?

463
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,446
Hey. It's between you and her.

464
00:26:21,144 --> 00:26:23,451
Come on, Barkley.
Get in there. Go on.

465
00:26:25,061 --> 00:26:26,236
[door closes]

466
00:26:52,785 --> 00:26:54,090
LAVINIA: Excuse me.

467
00:26:54,221 --> 00:26:55,875
Excuse me.
May I help you?

468
00:26:56,876 --> 00:26:57,920
Hey, Vin.

469
00:27:01,794 --> 00:27:03,012
Suzette?

470
00:27:04,274 --> 00:27:06,102
Yep.

471
00:27:06,233 --> 00:27:09,540
Oh, my God.
Is that really you?

472
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:11,064
Yeah.

473
00:27:11,194 --> 00:27:12,935
Well, no. I mean,
the tits aren't me.

474
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:14,720
They, um, they're fake,

475
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:17,679
but in here somewhere, it's me.

476
00:27:19,725 --> 00:27:21,291
What are you doing here?

477
00:27:21,422 --> 00:27:22,989
I-I brought Hannah home.

478
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:24,860
-My daughter?
-SUZETTE: Yeah.

479
00:27:24,991 --> 00:27:26,645
She's okay. She's in bed.

480
00:27:29,865 --> 00:27:31,214
No, she is not.

481
00:27:31,345 --> 00:27:32,563
She is not in bed.

482
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:34,000
It's her prom night,
and she was gonna

483
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,697
spend the night
with Carol Bishop.

484
00:27:35,828 --> 00:27:38,091
No, Vin.
She's in bed. Go look.

485
00:27:41,485 --> 00:27:43,009
Why would you be
bringing her home?

486
00:27:44,575 --> 00:27:45,881
'Cause they were partying,

487
00:27:46,012 --> 00:27:47,666
you know, at the hotel
that I'm staying at,

488
00:27:47,796 --> 00:27:49,972
and she needed
a ride home, so...

489
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:52,409
I gave her one.

490
00:27:53,933 --> 00:27:55,630
That doesn't make sense.

491
00:27:55,761 --> 00:27:58,546
You're leaving something out,
like what about the...

492
00:27:59,286 --> 00:28:01,462
Jules, her date?

493
00:28:01,592 --> 00:28:03,682
I don't know. I mean,
they kind of went off, I guess,

494
00:28:03,812 --> 00:28:04,900
with the other kids
or something.

495
00:28:05,031 --> 00:28:06,728
You know, you're making me
really nervous, Vin.

496
00:28:06,859 --> 00:28:09,339
I mean, I'm just, like,
I'm freaking out here, man.

497
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:12,995
I mean, aren't you,
like, glad to see me?

498
00:28:19,001 --> 00:28:20,524
Suzette, what is it
that you want?

499
00:28:22,613 --> 00:28:24,485
Who said I wanted anything?

500
00:28:24,615 --> 00:28:25,704
You just show up here
out of the blue

501
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:28,054
in Phoenix, 16 years later?

502
00:28:28,968 --> 00:28:29,925
20.

503
00:28:30,404 --> 00:28:31,666
Or 20.

504
00:28:32,885 --> 00:28:33,842
You want money.

505
00:28:35,104 --> 00:28:36,149
Who told you that?

506
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:37,672
I'm asking you.

507
00:28:37,803 --> 00:28:39,500
That I want money?

508
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:41,676
-That is so fucked up!
-Shh!

509
00:28:41,807 --> 00:28:44,592
I mean, my being in Phoenix
has nothing to do with you.

510
00:28:45,593 --> 00:28:46,899
Are you telling me the truth?

511
00:28:47,464 --> 00:28:49,292
No. Shit.

512
00:28:49,423 --> 00:28:51,251
Okay, Vinnie. Hold on.

513
00:28:51,381 --> 00:28:52,339
I got fired from my job.

514
00:28:52,469 --> 00:28:54,210
What did you tell
my daughter?

515
00:28:56,169 --> 00:28:58,432
I named every guy
you ever rattled.

516
00:28:58,562 --> 00:29:00,347
That is not funny, Suzette.

517
00:29:00,477 --> 00:29:03,002
She didn't even know
who I was, Vinnie.

518
00:29:03,132 --> 00:29:04,612
Of course not.

519
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,788
My husband, my children,
my community,

520
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:08,137
they don't know anything
about that period

521
00:29:08,268 --> 00:29:10,487
when you and I were... friends.

522
00:29:10,618 --> 00:29:12,925
People that
I associated with then,

523
00:29:13,055 --> 00:29:14,448
yourself included, they're...

524
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,756
they're...

525
00:29:17,886 --> 00:29:20,628
no longer part of
my current reality.

526
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,369
-Oh, fuck your current reality.
-Shh!

527
00:29:22,499 --> 00:29:25,546
I mean, look at you with your
pools and your fountains.

528
00:29:25,676 --> 00:29:26,895
I mean, come on, Vinnie.

529
00:29:27,026 --> 00:29:29,071
Don't call me Vinnie.
Nobody calls me that.

530
00:29:29,202 --> 00:29:30,551
My name is Lavinia.

531
00:29:31,073 --> 00:29:32,422
Vinnie.

532
00:29:32,553 --> 00:29:35,425
All right. I will give you
$5,000 to get out of my life.

533
00:29:38,167 --> 00:29:39,778
I didn't come here
to harangue you.

534
00:29:39,908 --> 00:29:41,344
-Harass.
-Whatever.

535
00:29:42,563 --> 00:29:45,087
You are souptight.

536
00:29:46,393 --> 00:29:48,003
So uptight.

537
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,878
I'm not uptight.

538
00:29:53,008 --> 00:29:55,706
I just brought the kid home
because she needed a ride,

539
00:29:55,837 --> 00:29:57,708
and she did,
she needed a ride.

540
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,495
Suzette, I am not
without gratitude.

541
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:04,411
But that girl
is on the dean's list.

542
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:05,673
She's going to Vassar
in the fall.

543
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,980
She's the valedictorian
of her graduating class.

544
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,111
I get it.

545
00:30:12,332 --> 00:30:13,289
Don't worry.

546
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,682
I didn't tell her anything.

547
00:30:16,945 --> 00:30:17,990
[gate opening]

548
00:30:20,122 --> 00:30:21,950
La-La-La-La-Lavinia.

549
00:30:30,437 --> 00:30:31,612
LAVINIA: Down.

550
00:30:41,665 --> 00:30:43,842
Hannah. Hannah, wake up.

551
00:30:43,972 --> 00:30:45,191
I need to talk with you.

552
00:30:47,149 --> 00:30:48,411
Ginger.

553
00:30:48,542 --> 00:30:49,978
This doesn't concern you. Out.

554
00:30:50,109 --> 00:30:51,284
Close the door, please.

555
00:30:52,589 --> 00:30:53,808
[quietly] Mom, I'm sleeping.

556
00:30:53,939 --> 00:30:56,028
Well, you'll have plenty of time
to sleep after this.

557
00:30:57,464 --> 00:30:58,769
I'm gonna ask you something,

558
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,859
and I won't tolerate
anything but the truth.

559
00:31:03,731 --> 00:31:05,994
Did you do drugs
at the prom last night?

560
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:07,126
What are you
talking about?

561
00:31:07,256 --> 00:31:08,997
Did you do drugs?

562
00:31:09,128 --> 00:31:10,303
Answer me honestly.

563
00:31:16,265 --> 00:31:17,440
[sighs]

564
00:31:17,963 --> 00:31:19,181
I had wine.

565
00:31:21,357 --> 00:31:23,925
I stupidly had 2 kinds,
red and white,

566
00:31:24,056 --> 00:31:25,492
and the mixture
makes you sick.

567
00:31:25,622 --> 00:31:27,363
I didn't even know that
till after.

568
00:31:30,584 --> 00:31:32,064
And that's all?

569
00:31:32,194 --> 00:31:33,326
That was enough.

570
00:31:56,262 --> 00:31:57,698
I'm a guest of Harry Plummer.

571
00:31:57,828 --> 00:31:59,656
He gave me his key, 419.

572
00:31:59,787 --> 00:32:02,485
Mr. Plummer
has changed rooms.

573
00:32:02,616 --> 00:32:05,010
He's now in room 1007.

574
00:32:06,837 --> 00:32:08,100
Thank you.

575
00:32:19,241 --> 00:32:20,939
[water running]

576
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,638
[faucet squeaks]

577
00:32:27,858 --> 00:32:28,685
Harry?

578
00:32:28,816 --> 00:32:29,948
[door opens]

579
00:32:30,078 --> 00:32:33,038
Hi. They cleaned up
the vomit, but I had to move.

580
00:32:33,168 --> 00:32:34,865
Of course you did.

581
00:32:34,996 --> 00:32:37,259
Oh, I'm so hungry.

582
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,565
I just got to eat
something.

583
00:32:38,695 --> 00:32:40,045
Here. You want one?

584
00:32:40,175 --> 00:32:42,482
You should have something
substantial, Suzette.

585
00:32:42,612 --> 00:32:43,831
Let me order up some breakfast.

586
00:32:44,701 --> 00:32:46,225
No. I'm not staying.

587
00:32:46,355 --> 00:32:48,183
I'm going to change my clothes,
then I'm gonna take off.

588
00:32:51,056 --> 00:32:53,362
Oh. I've drawn you a bath.

589
00:32:57,671 --> 00:32:59,281
You've drawn me a bath?

590
00:32:59,412 --> 00:33:01,675
Mm-hmm.

591
00:33:01,805 --> 00:33:04,460
You didn't even know
when I was gonna be here.

592
00:33:04,591 --> 00:33:06,332
I've been letting it out
and adding hot.

593
00:33:15,558 --> 00:33:17,256
I'm not in the same mood
I was in yesterday, Harry.

594
00:33:17,386 --> 00:33:18,822
No, no, no. Sure.

595
00:33:18,953 --> 00:33:21,956
It's just that it's been
a hell of a long night,
you know.

596
00:33:28,528 --> 00:33:30,051
When are you gonna
shoot your father?

597
00:33:32,532 --> 00:33:34,012
Not today. It's Sunday.

598
00:33:45,197 --> 00:33:46,198
Harry?

599
00:33:47,721 --> 00:33:48,983
What?

600
00:33:49,114 --> 00:33:50,550
Come on in.

601
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,552
Aren't you naked?

602
00:33:52,682 --> 00:33:54,249
Just come on in.
I want to talk.

603
00:33:56,251 --> 00:33:57,252
[door opens]

604
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,125
Yes?

605
00:34:00,647 --> 00:34:01,735
Sit down.

606
00:34:08,263 --> 00:34:09,917
Oh, man.

607
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:13,790
I was like a blemish
in her prissy little world.

608
00:34:13,921 --> 00:34:15,618
You should have seen
that place, Harry.

609
00:34:16,967 --> 00:34:18,578
Even the kids have a wing.

610
00:34:20,101 --> 00:34:22,016
And there's Vin,

611
00:34:22,147 --> 00:34:23,757
going around like a princess

612
00:34:23,887 --> 00:34:25,846
and the pool's all going.

613
00:34:27,326 --> 00:34:29,719
Ahh. She had her nose
fucked with, too.

614
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:32,374
I didn't say anything
to her, but, you know...

615
00:34:32,505 --> 00:34:34,942
It was definitely
not her nose, Harry.

616
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:41,470
Man, she is in dreamland.

617
00:34:42,863 --> 00:34:44,169
And then she looks at me

618
00:34:44,299 --> 00:34:46,823
like I'm some kind of
voodoo ghost

619
00:34:46,954 --> 00:34:48,869
from her past, you know,
scared to death

620
00:34:48,999 --> 00:34:50,697
I'm gonna, like,
blow her cover.

621
00:34:54,962 --> 00:34:57,747
She offered me money
to disappear, Harry.

622
00:35:02,361 --> 00:35:03,840
I didn't take it.

623
00:35:03,971 --> 00:35:05,929
I wouldn't touch it
with a 10-foot pole.

624
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,457
At least you have integrity.

625
00:35:16,853 --> 00:35:18,942
Yeah. Integrity...

626
00:35:19,508 --> 00:35:20,770
and I'm broke.

627
00:35:20,901 --> 00:35:22,772
Oh! Ooh!

628
00:35:22,903 --> 00:35:24,557
[spits] I got something...

629
00:35:24,687 --> 00:35:26,950
-You want water?
-No, don't dote on me, Harry.

630
00:35:27,081 --> 00:35:28,952
Actually, I do want
some water, please.

631
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:31,346
[telephone ringing]

632
00:35:32,565 --> 00:35:34,523
Who the hell
knows I'm here?

633
00:35:34,654 --> 00:35:36,569
I don't know.
The hotel, for a start.

634
00:35:41,965 --> 00:35:43,315
Answer the phone, Harry.

635
00:35:47,536 --> 00:35:49,059
Hello? Yes.

636
00:35:51,192 --> 00:35:52,367
Uh, yes.

637
00:35:56,371 --> 00:35:59,374
No. Sure. Please come up.
Room 1007.

638
00:36:00,767 --> 00:36:01,855
Who was that?

639
00:36:02,812 --> 00:36:03,726
Lavinia.

640
00:36:03,857 --> 00:36:04,988
[screams] What?

641
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:10,472
-She said she needs to see you.
-Oh, my God!

642
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,561
After all I told you,

643
00:36:12,692 --> 00:36:14,128
you think I want her
coming up here?

644
00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:15,738
I just followed
my instincts, Suzette.

645
00:36:15,869 --> 00:36:18,480
You're not
following your instincts,
you're following hers!

646
00:36:18,611 --> 00:36:20,308
She manipulates people!

647
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:22,223
I hate you right now, Harry!

648
00:36:24,965 --> 00:36:25,922
Oh, God.

649
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,193
Lavinia Kingsley.

650
00:36:35,323 --> 00:36:36,672
Harry Plummer.

651
00:36:36,803 --> 00:36:39,022
Suzette's just wiping herself,
drying herself off.

652
00:36:39,153 --> 00:36:40,372
She had a bath.

653
00:36:41,764 --> 00:36:42,939
Oh.

654
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:45,638
I don't want to interrupt...
something.

655
00:36:45,768 --> 00:36:47,988
No, no, no. Please come in,
Mrs. Kingsley.

656
00:36:48,118 --> 00:36:49,076
Thank you, Mr. Plummer.

657
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,991
I'll just be 2 seconds, really.
Just--

658
00:36:51,121 --> 00:36:52,427
You better be here
to apologize

659
00:36:52,558 --> 00:36:53,994
because you treated
me like the scum of the earth,

660
00:36:54,124 --> 00:36:55,430
and if you think those
flowers are gonna

661
00:36:55,561 --> 00:36:57,737
make me feel better,
you're sadly mistaken.

662
00:36:57,867 --> 00:37:00,392
I'm gonna smoke, Harry.
Endure it.

663
00:37:00,522 --> 00:37:01,915
You have every right
to be offended,

664
00:37:02,045 --> 00:37:03,177
and I do apologize.

665
00:37:03,308 --> 00:37:04,570
That is why I am here.

666
00:37:15,711 --> 00:37:18,236
Will you join me for lunch
tomorrow afternoon?

667
00:37:20,934 --> 00:37:22,805
And what will happen
at lunch, Lavinia?

668
00:37:24,372 --> 00:37:26,287
Well, I would like
the opportunity

669
00:37:26,418 --> 00:37:28,898
to explain to you why
I'm no longer the person
that I was years ago,

670
00:37:29,029 --> 00:37:30,509
how I've changed
for the better, I think,

671
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:32,728
and the direction
that my life has gone in.

672
00:37:32,859 --> 00:37:35,165
For instance, I'm very much
involved in charity work,

673
00:37:35,296 --> 00:37:36,602
and there's actually
a tree planted

674
00:37:36,732 --> 00:37:38,430
near city hall
with my name on it

675
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,040
right here in Phoenix.

676
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:42,129
Phoenix being
the mythical bird
that rose from the ashes,

677
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,305
I, too, have become someone
that you don't know, Suzette.

678
00:37:44,436 --> 00:37:46,046
And I would like
the opportunity

679
00:37:46,176 --> 00:37:47,569
to introduce myself to you.

680
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,528
People do change, Suzette.

681
00:37:49,658 --> 00:37:51,007
Not that it's been easy.
It hasn't been.

682
00:37:51,138 --> 00:37:54,315
But I could not be
the person that I was

683
00:37:54,446 --> 00:37:57,710
because the person that I was
is not the person that I am.

684
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,364
Vinnie, stop, okay?

685
00:37:59,494 --> 00:38:01,453
'Cause you're going
right up your own asshole,

686
00:38:01,583 --> 00:38:03,629
and I don't feel like following.

687
00:38:03,759 --> 00:38:05,283
I know what
she means, though.

688
00:38:05,413 --> 00:38:06,588
Why, thank you.

689
00:38:07,067 --> 00:38:08,808
Harry, enough.

690
00:38:08,938 --> 00:38:11,941
Vinnie, I'm not
ashamed of my past.

691
00:38:12,072 --> 00:38:14,553
At least I'm not walking around
in some lance robe and slippers

692
00:38:14,683 --> 00:38:15,989
pretending that
it never happened.

693
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:17,599
My husband is a lawyer!

694
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,688
Oh, yeah? What are you
going to do, sue me?

695
00:38:19,819 --> 00:38:21,342
Could you just
let me finish, please?

696
00:38:21,473 --> 00:38:23,562
And he aspires
to a career in politics.

697
00:38:23,692 --> 00:38:26,782
Hey. The first lady of the land
is gonna be a banger sister?

698
00:38:26,913 --> 00:38:28,306
-[laughing]
-I am not a banger sister!

699
00:38:28,436 --> 00:38:31,744
Look, I am a mother,
and I am a very good mother.

700
00:38:31,874 --> 00:38:34,747
Hannah told me everything
about what happened at the prom.

701
00:38:34,877 --> 00:38:36,749
She told me that she drank
red and white wine,

702
00:38:36,879 --> 00:38:39,447
and the combination of the two
made her queasy.

703
00:38:39,578 --> 00:38:42,450
Queasy? She was
really out of it, Mrs. Kingsley.

704
00:38:42,581 --> 00:38:43,625
Wasn't she, Suzette?

705
00:38:43,756 --> 00:38:44,887
Oh, I don't think so, Harry.

706
00:38:45,018 --> 00:38:46,759
She would have told
her mother everything.

707
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,806
So, what time's lunch?

708
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,852
I beg your pardon?

709
00:38:52,982 --> 00:38:56,246
Yeah. We're going to lunch.
You said.

710
00:38:56,377 --> 00:38:59,598
Oh. Yeah, but I have
just said everything

711
00:38:59,728 --> 00:39:02,035
that I planned to say at lunch.

712
00:39:02,165 --> 00:39:04,559
You know, where I
come from, Lavinia,

713
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:07,780
which, granted, is a hellhole
in West Hollywood,

714
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:10,304
the people go on and on
and on and on about themselves

715
00:39:10,435 --> 00:39:11,871
all day long.

716
00:39:12,001 --> 00:39:15,135
They at least have the decency
to ask the other person,

717
00:39:15,265 --> 00:39:17,442
"So, what's new with you?"

718
00:39:18,486 --> 00:39:20,096
Noon, in the lobby?

719
00:39:20,227 --> 00:39:21,924
Look, Suzette, I am
not self-indulgent.

720
00:39:22,055 --> 00:39:26,276
I may be a lot of things,
but that is one thing
that I am not.

721
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:28,496
Then why are you still
talking about yourself?

722
00:39:29,671 --> 00:39:31,064
[door opens]

723
00:39:31,194 --> 00:39:32,979
And by the way,
how did you know
what room I was staying in?

724
00:39:33,109 --> 00:39:35,242
Oh, I described you
to the clerk at the desk.

725
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,465
Ugh! "I described you
to the clerk at the desk."

726
00:39:40,595 --> 00:39:44,904
I got to get some drinks in her
and get her mojo going, man.

727
00:39:45,034 --> 00:39:46,166
But first, I got to crash.

728
00:39:46,296 --> 00:39:48,168
Oh, I'm so tired.

729
00:39:48,298 --> 00:39:49,735
Oh, yeah. This is good.

730
00:39:50,649 --> 00:39:51,693
Oh.

731
00:40:03,488 --> 00:40:04,402
Harry?

732
00:40:06,752 --> 00:40:10,364
What did he do to you,
your father, to make you
love him so much?

733
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:14,934
He put a kind of curse on me.

734
00:40:17,806 --> 00:40:20,243
How'd he do that?

735
00:40:20,374 --> 00:40:24,247
We had a family business
selling furniture. I hated it.

736
00:40:25,553 --> 00:40:26,902
I wanted to be a writer.

737
00:40:27,033 --> 00:40:28,208
He hated that.

738
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:31,167
"Go ahead," he said.

739
00:40:31,298 --> 00:40:33,387
"Everything you touch
is gonna turn to shit.

740
00:40:33,518 --> 00:40:34,475
"You'll look back someday

741
00:40:34,606 --> 00:40:35,737
and there'll be
nothing to look at."

742
00:40:37,957 --> 00:40:39,611
Well, you took off anyway, see?

743
00:40:40,176 --> 00:40:41,264
I like that.

744
00:40:42,744 --> 00:40:44,442
And then you blew
into Hollywood?

745
00:40:45,617 --> 00:40:46,705
Yeah.

746
00:40:48,228 --> 00:40:49,316
It was great.

747
00:40:51,013 --> 00:40:53,581
The whole world
wanted a piece of me.

748
00:40:53,712 --> 00:40:56,105
You know, everybody
was jumping into bed
with everybody

749
00:40:56,236 --> 00:40:57,411
back in those days.

750
00:40:59,761 --> 00:41:01,284
I had a Dodge Duster.

751
00:41:02,634 --> 00:41:04,418
Every Friday night,
I'd eat at Joe Allen's.

752
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:07,682
God, it was fabulous.

753
00:41:08,422 --> 00:41:09,815
You mean, you drove?

754
00:41:13,035 --> 00:41:15,734
Gold Dodge Duster
with white vinyl seats.

755
00:41:19,651 --> 00:41:20,782
Did you have a girlfriend?

756
00:41:22,958 --> 00:41:24,177
Yeah.

757
00:41:24,873 --> 00:41:25,918
What happened?

758
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:31,837
Everything fell to pieces
just the way he said it would.

759
00:41:31,967 --> 00:41:34,448
Well, come on. You're giving
the old man too much credit.

760
00:41:35,754 --> 00:41:37,799
You're not selling furniture.

761
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:39,105
Is he still doing that?

762
00:41:40,367 --> 00:41:41,455
No.

763
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:45,328
He's...

764
00:41:45,459 --> 00:41:48,941
he's at some place
called Horizon Hills.

765
00:41:49,071 --> 00:41:51,030
It's a retirement community.

766
00:42:04,565 --> 00:42:05,435
[groans softly]

767
00:42:05,566 --> 00:42:06,524
Don't move.

768
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,746
You can do
whatever you want,

769
00:42:11,877 --> 00:42:13,531
but you're not
allowed to think.

770
00:42:23,715 --> 00:42:25,107
You're thinking, Harry.

771
00:42:27,762 --> 00:42:29,068
I'm terrified.

772
00:42:29,198 --> 00:42:30,199
Shut up.

773
00:42:30,722 --> 00:42:31,679
Okay.

774
00:42:50,002 --> 00:42:53,527
Good morning, Mrs. Plummer.

775
00:42:53,658 --> 00:42:55,573
Hey, you've got two
things going for you.

776
00:42:55,703 --> 00:42:57,052
One is that I'm in a good mood,

777
00:42:57,183 --> 00:42:58,619
and two is that you're cute.

778
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,363
Oh, Suzette.

779
00:43:03,493 --> 00:43:04,973
I came to apologize
in person.

780
00:43:05,104 --> 00:43:06,322
I completely forgot
about Ginger.

781
00:43:06,453 --> 00:43:07,976
She's taking her
driver's test today.

782
00:43:08,107 --> 00:43:09,369
-Ginger?
-My 16-year-old.

783
00:43:09,499 --> 00:43:10,718
I can't tell you
how important this is.

784
00:43:10,849 --> 00:43:12,502
I have to cancel lunch.
I apologize.

785
00:43:12,633 --> 00:43:13,503
This is for you.

786
00:43:13,634 --> 00:43:14,940
Are you trying
to weasel out of this?

787
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:17,986
No! This is one of those rites
of passage moments.

788
00:43:18,117 --> 00:43:19,074
I have to be there.

789
00:43:19,205 --> 00:43:20,336
Well, I'll go with you.

790
00:43:21,294 --> 00:43:22,251
Oh.

791
00:43:23,035 --> 00:43:24,863
Mom, what are you doing?

792
00:43:26,081 --> 00:43:27,169
Nothing.

793
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,257
Who's that?

794
00:43:29,911 --> 00:43:31,609
Suzette, my friend.

795
00:43:33,306 --> 00:43:35,134
-Your friend?
-All right. Just get in the car.

796
00:43:35,264 --> 00:43:36,265
I'll be there in a minute.

797
00:43:37,963 --> 00:43:39,355
No, you're not ditching me.

798
00:43:39,486 --> 00:43:41,880
You made a date,
and I got all dressed up.

799
00:43:45,797 --> 00:43:48,277
Okay. I just have
to get organized.

800
00:43:50,018 --> 00:43:51,150
Excuse me. Hi.

801
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,413
Would you please
take this up to room 1007?

802
00:43:53,543 --> 00:43:55,154
And don't water it.

803
00:43:55,284 --> 00:43:56,808
It doesn't need watering.

804
00:43:56,938 --> 00:43:58,461
They've already been watered,
so you don't have to water them.

805
00:43:58,592 --> 00:43:59,985
Come on. Let's go.

806
00:44:00,115 --> 00:44:03,292
Don't water them.
Please.

807
00:44:03,423 --> 00:44:06,948
Okay. In case you'd noticed,
there's one other thing,
You probably won't,

808
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:09,168
but Ginger has just
a little habit of...

809
00:44:09,298 --> 00:44:11,779
She makes a little noise
in the back of
her throat sometimes,

810
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:14,129
and the specialists
say it's nothing.

811
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:15,391
And it's probably
going to dissolve

812
00:44:15,522 --> 00:44:16,523
in a matter of time,
and then--

813
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,264
-Great.
-Yeah.

814
00:44:18,394 --> 00:44:20,875
But our policy
is just to, it's just,
we're gonna ignore it.

815
00:44:21,006 --> 00:44:22,703
[throat gurgling]

816
00:44:22,834 --> 00:44:24,139
Take a breath, Gin.

817
00:44:25,575 --> 00:44:27,665
I wanted a tattoo, mom,
but you said I couldn't.

818
00:44:29,144 --> 00:44:30,668
Just stay
in your lane, honey.

819
00:44:32,104 --> 00:44:33,845
Is her tongue pierced?

820
00:44:33,975 --> 00:44:35,411
LAVINIA: Sweetheart, it's not
nice to talk about people

821
00:44:35,542 --> 00:44:37,631
in front of them
as if they're not there.

822
00:44:37,762 --> 00:44:39,111
I know someone
who had her labia pierced.

823
00:44:39,241 --> 00:44:40,895
All right, concentrate
on your driving, Gin.

824
00:44:41,026 --> 00:44:42,505
GINGER: And I better not
get the guy Jennifer got.

825
00:44:42,636 --> 00:44:44,159
He failed her for talking.

826
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:45,552
All right. Well, don't talk,
then. Just drive.

827
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:46,945
That's the way
accidents happen.

828
00:44:47,075 --> 00:44:48,773
From talking?
I don't think so, mom.

829
00:44:48,903 --> 00:44:49,948
Stay in your lane.

830
00:44:50,078 --> 00:44:51,471
What lane are you
referring to?

831
00:44:51,601 --> 00:44:52,994
The lane that you're in!

832
00:44:53,125 --> 00:44:54,604
GINGER: Well, if I'm in it,
then what's the problem?

833
00:44:54,735 --> 00:44:55,780
LAVINIA: Will you look
where you're driving?

834
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:56,824
[horn honks]

835
00:44:56,955 --> 00:44:59,305
[exhales]

836
00:45:01,524 --> 00:45:03,526
It's always been much harder
with Ginger than with Hannah,

837
00:45:03,657 --> 00:45:06,268
because Hannah tends to be
solution-oriented,

838
00:45:06,399 --> 00:45:07,487
whereas Ginger,

839
00:45:07,617 --> 00:45:09,968
well, she's artistic,
which is, of course,

840
00:45:10,098 --> 00:45:12,231
what I love about her
and always want to encourage,

841
00:45:12,361 --> 00:45:15,103
but she does tend to be defiant.

842
00:45:15,234 --> 00:45:17,062
You didn't name her
after Ginger Baker, did you?

843
00:45:17,192 --> 00:45:19,673
No. I was pregnant
and craving ginger,

844
00:45:19,804 --> 00:45:20,761
so I ate it every day.

845
00:45:20,892 --> 00:45:23,155
Oh. Way better.

846
00:45:23,285 --> 00:45:25,113
-Gosh. What time is it?
-I don't know.

847
00:45:25,244 --> 00:45:26,462
'Course you don't.

848
00:45:26,593 --> 00:45:28,638
Oh, gosh, I hope
she passes this thing.

849
00:45:28,769 --> 00:45:31,467
It's going to be so good
for her self-esteem.

850
00:45:31,598 --> 00:45:33,339
You know that guy Harry,
the guy you met?

851
00:45:33,469 --> 00:45:35,689
-Mmm.
-He doesn't drive.

852
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:37,778
He might now, though,
'cause we had sex last night.

853
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,347
First time in 10 years
for that guy.

854
00:45:41,477 --> 00:45:43,175
I kind of liked it,
though, you know?

855
00:45:43,305 --> 00:45:45,351
I felt like I was
accomplishing something.

856
00:45:45,481 --> 00:45:48,223
Boy, when he came,
it was like somebody
in an electric chair.

857
00:45:49,703 --> 00:45:51,966
I thought you were in
a relationship, the two of you.

858
00:45:52,097 --> 00:45:55,927
No, no. I just picked him up,
like, somewhere in Blythe,

859
00:45:56,057 --> 00:45:57,667
and he's not
a bad rattle, though.

860
00:45:58,538 --> 00:45:59,669
There's hope for Harry.

861
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:02,020
Hope for Harry.

862
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,329
I hate this place.

863
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:09,201
I know. Can you imagine
working here?

864
00:46:09,331 --> 00:46:11,116
-Ha ha.
-Oh, no color.

865
00:46:11,246 --> 00:46:13,945
I'd go crazy. I got
to have color around me,
or I go nuts.

866
00:46:14,728 --> 00:46:15,860
I hate drab.

867
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,212
You just looked
right at my dress

868
00:46:20,342 --> 00:46:21,604
when you said that.

869
00:46:21,735 --> 00:46:22,954
-I did not.
-Oh, you did.

870
00:46:23,084 --> 00:46:24,564
-No, I didn't.
-Yes, you did.

871
00:46:24,694 --> 00:46:26,696
I would kill to have, uh...

872
00:46:26,827 --> 00:46:28,089
-Yeah.
-I would.

873
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:32,006
Sure, Suzette. It's almost
the same color as the walls.

874
00:46:32,137 --> 00:46:33,878
Oh, come on.
No, it isn't.

875
00:46:34,748 --> 00:46:35,836
Yes, it is.

876
00:46:36,837 --> 00:46:38,883
I'm the same color

877
00:46:39,013 --> 00:46:41,407
as the Department
of Motor Vehicles, and you...

878
00:46:42,843 --> 00:46:43,888
look like a flower.

879
00:46:47,152 --> 00:46:48,196
Why are you so pissed off?

880
00:46:48,327 --> 00:46:50,982
I'm not!
I'm complimenting you.

881
00:46:51,112 --> 00:46:53,593
I mean, all the guys here
are staring at you.

882
00:46:53,723 --> 00:46:55,682
-That's the idea, isn't it?
-[beeps]

883
00:46:56,509 --> 00:46:57,640
What idea?

884
00:46:57,771 --> 00:46:59,599
Well, I mean, if you
put yourself together

885
00:46:59,729 --> 00:47:01,688
the way that you've
put yourself together,

886
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,951
that's, obviously, you're trying
to get attention.

887
00:47:04,082 --> 00:47:05,170
I don't look any different.

888
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:06,214
Oh, please.

889
00:47:08,347 --> 00:47:10,566
You used to be much
smaller-chested.

890
00:47:11,959 --> 00:47:12,917
You mean, my tits
are bothering you?

891
00:47:13,047 --> 00:47:14,483
Oh, come on.

892
00:47:14,614 --> 00:47:16,311
This machine is bothering me
because it's not functioning.

893
00:47:16,442 --> 00:47:17,922
You know what? I think
you're, like, ticked off

894
00:47:18,052 --> 00:47:20,533
because you had the big knockers
back in the day.

895
00:47:22,361 --> 00:47:23,492
-Well, please.
-No, yeah.

896
00:47:23,623 --> 00:47:24,972
It's true. Come on, babe.

897
00:47:25,103 --> 00:47:27,018
And you know what? You used to,
like, you know, flash 'em,

898
00:47:27,148 --> 00:47:29,542
and they were famous,
those tits,

899
00:47:29,672 --> 00:47:31,544
and I was flat as a pancake.

900
00:47:31,674 --> 00:47:35,330
So I made, you know,
bigger... ones.

901
00:47:35,678 --> 00:47:36,679
So...

902
00:47:38,377 --> 00:47:39,508
But if it makes you
feel any better--

903
00:47:39,639 --> 00:47:41,423
I don't feel bad.
I don't need to feel better.

904
00:47:41,554 --> 00:47:45,427
They're too big, and, you know,
I overdid it.

905
00:47:45,558 --> 00:47:47,255
Well, I wasn't gonna
say anything,

906
00:47:47,386 --> 00:47:48,517
but they're too big.

907
00:47:48,648 --> 00:47:50,606
Yeah, I went from, like,
one extreme to the other.

908
00:47:50,737 --> 00:47:52,217
[screaming] Mom!

909
00:47:52,347 --> 00:47:54,349
Mom, he failed me
for no reason!

910
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,960
Oh, my God!
Gin, what happened?

911
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:59,224
Nothing! I just drove
like a normal person.

912
00:47:59,354 --> 00:48:01,008
But he decided
to persecute me.

913
00:48:01,139 --> 00:48:03,097
Sweetie, it says that you
ran a red light, honey.

914
00:48:03,228 --> 00:48:06,187
Yeah, right!
As if I'd do that on a test!

915
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:09,930
Oh! And I told everybody
I was taking this stupid thing!

916
00:48:10,061 --> 00:48:11,497
I promised Jennifer

917
00:48:11,627 --> 00:48:13,412
I would drive her
to the Pickle Pan!

918
00:48:13,542 --> 00:48:15,370
All right, you know what?
I can...

919
00:48:15,501 --> 00:48:16,894
[screaming]

920
00:48:17,024 --> 00:48:18,460
I'm going to take her
home right now.

921
00:48:18,591 --> 00:48:20,027
She just treated
you like shit.

922
00:48:20,158 --> 00:48:21,463
Well, she's distraught!

923
00:48:21,594 --> 00:48:23,117
I mean, I'll drop you
at the hotel.

924
00:48:23,248 --> 00:48:24,205
No, wait a minute.

925
00:48:24,336 --> 00:48:26,251
This is not... This is, like,
a big deal...

926
00:48:26,381 --> 00:48:27,905
We're not even
getting along.

927
00:48:28,035 --> 00:48:29,558
-Suzette, come on.
-We were going to have lunch.

928
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:31,517
We're not getting along.

929
00:48:31,647 --> 00:48:32,692
[dog barking]

930
00:48:32,822 --> 00:48:35,216
[pop music playing over stereo]

931
00:48:35,347 --> 00:48:36,609
LAVINIA: Somebody
left Barkley out.

932
00:48:36,739 --> 00:48:38,263
Barkley!

933
00:48:38,393 --> 00:48:40,265
Barkley! Barkley, come here.

934
00:48:40,395 --> 00:48:42,006
Barkley! Gin.

935
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,530
Ginger, get Barkley in.

936
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:46,836
I can't, mom.
I'm too depressed.

937
00:48:46,967 --> 00:48:48,360
Hey. Get the dog.

938
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:52,668
Come on, Barkley,
you stupid moron.

939
00:48:54,583 --> 00:48:56,585
Hannah! You left
the gate open!

940
00:48:56,716 --> 00:48:57,935
The dog got out!

941
00:48:58,065 --> 00:48:58,936
[music intensifies]

942
00:48:59,066 --> 00:49:00,894
Hannah, turn the music off!

943
00:49:03,462 --> 00:49:04,985
JULES: Oh, Hannah.
Yeah, Hannah.

944
00:49:05,116 --> 00:49:07,248
[moaning]

945
00:49:07,379 --> 00:49:08,510
-Yeah.
-[Hannah moans]

946
00:49:08,989 --> 00:49:09,859
Hannah?

947
00:49:11,687 --> 00:49:12,732
Hannah!

948
00:49:12,862 --> 00:49:14,168
[Jules chuckles] Oh!

949
00:49:14,299 --> 00:49:16,214
Break it up. Come on.
Break it up!

950
00:49:16,344 --> 00:49:17,215
[screams]

951
00:49:18,738 --> 00:49:19,826
[gasps] Oh, Mom!

952
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,132
Come on, Hannah.
Get out of the pool.

953
00:49:21,262 --> 00:49:23,569
Jules, oh!
Get out of that pool!

954
00:49:24,526 --> 00:49:26,180
Hannah, stop it!

955
00:49:26,702 --> 00:49:27,660
[giggles]

956
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:29,270
Nothing was going on,
I swear to you.

957
00:49:29,401 --> 00:49:30,228
Oh, right!

958
00:49:30,358 --> 00:49:31,707
I'm almost 18!

959
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:33,840
I don't care how old
you are, Hannah.

960
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,537
You are still living
in my house.

961
00:49:35,668 --> 00:49:37,278
You are driving a car
that we paid for.

962
00:49:37,409 --> 00:49:38,758
We have paid for your
college education.

963
00:49:38,888 --> 00:49:41,543
As long as that is true,
you will abide by our rules!

964
00:49:41,674 --> 00:49:43,589
Do you understand?
Now, you get out of there!

965
00:49:43,719 --> 00:49:46,026
Get dressed!
Turn the music off!

966
00:49:47,549 --> 00:49:49,725
-And you're not helping matters.
-What did I do?

967
00:49:49,856 --> 00:49:52,032
Well, you're just
so permissive-looking,

968
00:49:52,163 --> 00:49:54,817
standing there...
the way you stand.

969
00:49:54,948 --> 00:49:57,385
But you said
I looked like a flower.

970
00:49:57,516 --> 00:50:00,127
Mom! I just stepped on a snail!

971
00:50:00,258 --> 00:50:02,173
There are no snails
on this property, Gin.

972
00:50:02,303 --> 00:50:04,044
What's this crunchy thing
I just, like, killed?

973
00:50:05,176 --> 00:50:06,655
Jules! I have known you

974
00:50:06,786 --> 00:50:09,310
since you've been
in preschool, young man.

975
00:50:09,441 --> 00:50:12,444
This is so not the norm
of how I behave, Mrs. Kingsley.

976
00:50:35,597 --> 00:50:37,034
LAVINIA: Hannah, of all people.

977
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:38,992
You don't think that maybe

978
00:50:39,123 --> 00:50:40,341
they were just
skinny-dipping, do you?

979
00:50:40,472 --> 00:50:42,604
No. They were going at it.

980
00:50:42,735 --> 00:50:44,737
In the pool, where we,
as a family, swim?

981
00:50:44,867 --> 00:50:46,434
-Yep.
-Oh! God.

982
00:50:48,523 --> 00:50:49,829
You don't think maybe
they just could've been

983
00:50:49,959 --> 00:50:51,657
rubbing up
against each other?

984
00:50:51,787 --> 00:50:53,137
No, they were fucking.

985
00:50:53,267 --> 00:50:54,486
Oh, my God.

986
00:50:54,616 --> 00:50:56,879
Hannah's the Valedictorian,
and that boy Jules,

987
00:50:57,010 --> 00:51:00,057
he got a National Award
for Community Service.

988
00:51:00,187 --> 00:51:01,797
He's a little weasel,
if you ask me.

989
00:51:01,928 --> 00:51:03,060
Why do you say that?

990
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:04,409
He just is. I can tell.

991
00:51:04,539 --> 00:51:06,889
You know, I can smell it. Hey.

992
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:08,543
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do now.

993
00:51:08,674 --> 00:51:10,632
Do you think I'm supposed to
call his parents and tell them?

994
00:51:10,763 --> 00:51:11,981
You're asking me?

995
00:51:13,287 --> 00:51:15,289
[whirring]

996
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:17,639
Why are you wasting
all those lemons?

997
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:20,468
Lemons eliminate odor, Suzette.

998
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:23,384
Oh, my God. You are
so freaked out about this.

999
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:24,864
Yes, I am.

1000
00:51:24,994 --> 00:51:26,822
School's out,
and they're seniors,

1001
00:51:26,953 --> 00:51:28,955
and they came back,
and they had a few beers,

1002
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,522
and they got naked in the pool.

1003
00:51:30,652 --> 00:51:32,393
I mean, they're just having fun.

1004
00:51:33,177 --> 00:51:34,482
They are kids!

1005
00:51:36,745 --> 00:51:37,833
I want to show you somethin'.

1006
00:51:40,271 --> 00:51:41,402
-Come here.
-What?

1007
00:51:41,533 --> 00:51:43,012
Refresh your memory.

1008
00:51:45,014 --> 00:51:46,494
Look at this.

1009
00:51:46,625 --> 00:51:47,669
Those aren't kids?

1010
00:51:48,975 --> 00:51:50,237
Oh, my God.

1011
00:51:50,368 --> 00:51:52,109
Remember we sat up there
over Sunset Boulevard,

1012
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:53,327
waiting for the sun
to come up?

1013
00:51:53,458 --> 00:51:54,589
Until the cops
made us get down.

1014
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,243
Mmm. Sunrise over sunset.

1015
00:51:56,374 --> 00:51:57,810
Just get to the point.

1016
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:59,942
Well, it was your idea to climb
up there in the first place.

1017
00:52:00,073 --> 00:52:01,030
Do you know why?

1018
00:52:01,161 --> 00:52:03,163
-No.
-Exactly.

1019
00:52:03,294 --> 00:52:06,123
We just did stuff.
We just did shit
for no reason, Vin.

1020
00:52:06,253 --> 00:52:07,036
[door opens]

1021
00:52:07,167 --> 00:52:09,256
-My God. That's Raymond.
-Oh. Oh.

1022
00:52:09,387 --> 00:52:10,736
-My husband.
-What are you gonna do with me?

1023
00:52:10,866 --> 00:52:12,259
Am I going to hide
in the closet or somethin'?

1024
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:13,695
No, no.
He knows about you.

1025
00:52:13,826 --> 00:52:15,175
I've just been a little sketchy,
that's all.

1026
00:52:15,306 --> 00:52:16,220
Like, how sketchy?

1027
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:17,830
I said we went
to college together.

1028
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,180
-I went to college?
-Yeah.

1029
00:52:20,311 --> 00:52:21,921
-[Raymond humming]
-I'm a really bad liar, Vinnie.

1030
00:52:22,051 --> 00:52:24,445
Okay. Then just tell
the minimum amount of truth.

1031
00:52:24,576 --> 00:52:25,446
-That's all.
-Mm-hmm.

1032
00:52:25,577 --> 00:52:27,448
-Hi, honey. Hi.
-Hi. Hi.

1033
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:31,017
Whoa! Sorry. Sorry.

1034
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:33,585
-Oh, this is Suzette.
-Suzette?

1035
00:52:33,715 --> 00:52:35,978
We were roommates
in Los Angeles.

1036
00:52:36,109 --> 00:52:37,719
Oh, Suzette.
Yes, of course. Of course.

1037
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:39,330
Suzette. Suzette.

1038
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:42,115
Hi. You went to UCLA?

1039
00:52:42,246 --> 00:52:45,466
Um, yeah, I saw
Country Joe and the Fish there.

1040
00:52:45,597 --> 00:52:47,033
Oh. [laughs]

1041
00:52:50,341 --> 00:52:54,171
Yeah. So, uh,
stay for dinner, Suzette.

1042
00:52:54,301 --> 00:52:56,303
I'm sure Lavinia
and I would love to
have you for dinner.

1043
00:52:56,434 --> 00:52:57,609
Please.
Stay for dinner.

1044
00:52:58,262 --> 00:52:59,480
-Sure.
-Good.

1045
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:01,134
Cool.

1046
00:53:02,048 --> 00:53:03,049
Groovy.

1047
00:53:09,098 --> 00:53:10,317
I'm staying for dinner.

1048
00:53:10,448 --> 00:53:11,318
Yeah.

1049
00:53:23,678 --> 00:53:24,897
Is Mom's friend for real?

1050
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,812
I don't know.

1051
00:53:26,942 --> 00:53:28,074
I don't care.

1052
00:53:32,034 --> 00:53:33,166
[sighs]

1053
00:53:33,297 --> 00:53:34,994
Get out of my room, okay?

1054
00:53:35,124 --> 00:53:38,040
All you ever do is eat,
and you're so skinny.

1055
00:53:38,171 --> 00:53:39,303
What's your problem?

1056
00:53:40,869 --> 00:53:42,131
[sighs]

1057
00:53:42,262 --> 00:53:44,569
Mom caught me
in the pool with Jules.

1058
00:53:48,616 --> 00:53:49,530
So?

1059
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,404
We weren't swimming.

1060
00:53:55,406 --> 00:53:56,581
Eww.

1061
00:53:56,711 --> 00:53:58,017
Your own mother?

1062
00:53:58,147 --> 00:54:00,933
Shut up.
It was horrible.

1063
00:54:01,063 --> 00:54:03,109
She stood there
and made us get out of the pool.

1064
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,850
It was so embarrassing.

1065
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:06,765
It's the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.

1066
00:54:07,853 --> 00:54:09,768
I failed my driving test.

1067
00:54:09,898 --> 00:54:11,465
You're allowed to fail. I'm not.

1068
00:54:11,596 --> 00:54:13,162
I don't even know
what it feels like.

1069
00:54:14,425 --> 00:54:15,817
Look at me. Look.
Look at this.

1070
00:54:15,948 --> 00:54:18,255
I'm on every single page
of this yearbook.

1071
00:54:19,168 --> 00:54:20,126
Ugh!

1072
00:54:21,388 --> 00:54:22,911
[exhales sharply]

1073
00:54:23,042 --> 00:54:24,391
And tomorrow, I'm expected

1074
00:54:24,522 --> 00:54:26,088
to get up in front
of the entire school

1075
00:54:26,219 --> 00:54:28,395
and say something profound

1076
00:54:28,526 --> 00:54:31,224
so that all the grads
will run off into the future

1077
00:54:31,355 --> 00:54:33,357
and live happily ever after.

1078
00:54:34,401 --> 00:54:35,576
Such a lie.

1079
00:54:37,186 --> 00:54:38,753
I wish I could just
get up there and fart.

1080
00:54:38,884 --> 00:54:40,189
[both chuckle]

1081
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,409
-Why don't you?
-Yeah, right.

1082
00:54:43,497 --> 00:54:45,238
All my teachers,
the head of school,

1083
00:54:45,369 --> 00:54:46,805
Dad, Mom,

1084
00:54:47,893 --> 00:54:49,111
especially Mom.

1085
00:54:50,417 --> 00:54:51,940
Can you imagine her reaction?

1086
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:58,643
Well, at least
it wouldn't be boring.

1087
00:55:04,866 --> 00:55:07,956
"Success is going
from failure to failure

1088
00:55:08,087 --> 00:55:09,610
without loss of enthusiasm."

1089
00:55:10,959 --> 00:55:12,526
Winston Churchill.

1090
00:55:12,657 --> 00:55:14,006
Yeah, but what if
the person testing you

1091
00:55:14,136 --> 00:55:16,095
has such bad body odor,
you can't even concentrate?

1092
00:55:16,225 --> 00:55:17,792
Red light means
stop, Ginger.

1093
00:55:19,098 --> 00:55:20,578
New topic. Hannah...

1094
00:55:21,492 --> 00:55:22,754
how's your speech coming?

1095
00:55:22,884 --> 00:55:25,104
I'm thinking of doing
something unconventional.

1096
00:55:25,234 --> 00:55:26,627
Well, that's always
a good idea.

1097
00:55:29,108 --> 00:55:31,415
If it were always a good idea,
it wouldn't be unconventional.

1098
00:55:32,459 --> 00:55:33,634
You're gonna do fine.

1099
00:55:33,765 --> 00:55:36,420
You look great. You have
a lot of color in your face.

1100
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:38,073
Have you been out
in the sun today?

1101
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:39,684
Yeah, Hannah.

1102
00:55:41,686 --> 00:55:44,123
[throat gurgling]

1103
00:55:45,037 --> 00:55:46,734
Ginger. Ginger.

1104
00:55:46,865 --> 00:55:48,606
Relax your throat
when you're eating.

1105
00:55:48,736 --> 00:55:49,955
Yeah, Ginger.

1106
00:55:52,958 --> 00:55:54,046
Suzette?

1107
00:55:54,176 --> 00:55:55,917
Mm-hmm?

1108
00:55:56,048 --> 00:55:58,572
You knew my wife before I did,
actually, before all of us did.

1109
00:55:58,703 --> 00:55:59,747
Mm-hmm.

1110
00:55:59,878 --> 00:56:02,315
Has she changed
over all these years?

1111
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,363
I see the same person.

1112
00:56:06,493 --> 00:56:07,538
[laughs]

1113
00:56:09,104 --> 00:56:10,541
What do the two of you
have in common?

1114
00:56:12,673 --> 00:56:14,283
What do we have
in common, Vin?

1115
00:56:16,721 --> 00:56:20,028
We, uh, went to
the occasional concert.

1116
00:56:21,726 --> 00:56:23,075
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1117
00:56:23,989 --> 00:56:25,860
Hmm. What kind of concerts?

1118
00:56:26,208 --> 00:56:27,166
Rock.

1119
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:29,951
It had to be
really rock, though.

1120
00:56:30,082 --> 00:56:31,213
Didn't it, babe?

1121
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:33,433
-Babe?
-Babe?

1122
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,523
We had very high standards.

1123
00:56:36,654 --> 00:56:38,699
Wait. Like, bands?

1124
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:41,136
[laughing] Mom in a mosh pit?

1125
00:56:41,267 --> 00:56:44,139

1126
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:45,924
Standing there
holding her purse.

1127
00:56:47,186 --> 00:56:50,407
With her hair all perfect.

1128
00:56:50,537 --> 00:56:52,583
"Come on, everyone.
Let's go. It's getting late."

1129
00:56:56,674 --> 00:56:58,676
This is a little difficult
to picture, Lavinia.

1130
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,156
[snaps fingers] Vinnie. Vin.

1131
00:57:01,287 --> 00:57:02,854
Yeah, babe.

1132
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:04,986
She danced.

1133
00:57:05,117 --> 00:57:07,815
That's what she did.
She danced.

1134
00:57:07,946 --> 00:57:09,164
Our mother?

1135
00:57:12,472 --> 00:57:15,910
Our mom's a really,
really, really bad dancer.

1136
00:57:16,041 --> 00:57:17,738
But that was what was
so really, really,

1137
00:57:17,869 --> 00:57:20,437
really genius about it.

1138
00:57:20,567 --> 00:57:21,873
You didn't care
what anybody thought,

1139
00:57:22,003 --> 00:57:22,917
did you, babe?

1140
00:57:29,489 --> 00:57:30,447
RAYMOND: Lavinia?

1141
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:36,844
Lavinia?

1142
00:57:42,807 --> 00:57:46,637
Anybody know what
Suzette's tattoo stands for?

1143
00:57:46,767 --> 00:57:48,769
Hmm? Don't say anything,
Suzette.

1144
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:51,816
It's a lizard with a crown
on its head. Anybody?

1145
00:57:54,035 --> 00:57:55,123
Hmm?

1146
00:57:55,254 --> 00:57:56,777
Uh, I have no idea.

1147
00:57:58,213 --> 00:57:59,345
Jim Morrison.

of his name scrambled up.

1151

having been up all night

1153
00:58:15,883 --> 00:58:18,364
after climbing
Pyramid of the Sun.

1154
00:58:21,933 --> 00:58:23,978
Mom, you're being weird.

1155
00:58:24,109 --> 00:58:26,285
Yeah. You're acting like
a whole different person.

1156
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,595
You are acting
a little strange, Lavinia.

1157
00:58:31,725 --> 00:58:33,988
Oh, you have no idea

1158
00:58:34,119 --> 00:58:36,338
how strange I can be.

1159
00:58:40,778 --> 00:58:41,996
What the hell was that?

1160
00:58:42,127 --> 00:58:43,258

Hey, I'm trapped out here
in the suburbs, Harry.

I'm getting to see how

I don't know.
It's really weird.

Well, you've made
progress since yesterday.

00:59:29,261 --> 00:59:30,610
Yesterday, she didn't
even wanna see you.

1170
00:59:30,741 --> 00:59:32,003
That's great. It's terrific.

1171
00:59:32,133 --> 00:59:33,744
Yeah, I don't know.
So what are you doing?

1172
00:59:33,874 --> 00:59:35,049
You sound speedy.

I'm writing like a fiend.

1174
00:59:37,704 --> 00:59:39,010
Yeah? What are you writing?

1175
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:41,665
I don't know. Everything.
Words, thoughts, images.

1176
00:59:41,795 --> 00:59:44,189
It's all just kind of
exploding out of me.

1177
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:45,886
I feel so ebullient.

1178
00:59:46,017 --> 00:59:48,019

got off, Harry. That's all.

It's more than that, Suzette.

I think you're my muse.

1183
00:59:59,247 --> 01:00:00,379
Uh, Harry, wait a minute.

1184
01:00:00,509 --> 01:00:03,251
I'm just a chick you met
in the desert, okay?

1185
01:00:03,382 --> 01:00:04,818
Yes, exactly. And if I...

1186
01:00:04,949 --> 01:00:06,385
I-I wouldn't have met
you in the desert

1187
01:00:06,515 --> 01:00:08,213
if I hadn't screwed up
my life so beautifully.

1188
01:00:09,431 --> 01:00:10,389
Where are you going
with this?

1189

If I had done
one thing different,

1190
01:00:11,869 --> 01:00:13,697
if one little thing
had worked out and gone right,

1191
01:00:13,827 --> 01:00:15,786
my whole life would have
gone in some other direction.

1192
01:00:15,916 --> 01:00:18,876
Instead everything went wrong
and led me to you.

1193
01:00:19,006 --> 01:00:20,878
Hey, you're way ahead
of yourself.

1194
01:00:23,315 --> 01:00:24,533
That I shouldn't feel
something for you?

1195
01:00:26,797 --> 01:00:28,755
No, no. You can feel
whatever you want,

1196
01:00:28,886 --> 01:00:30,975
but, you know, just don't
make a 3-act play out of it.

1197
01:00:31,802 --> 01:00:33,107
So, when are you coming home?

1198
01:00:33,238 --> 01:00:34,456
-Home?
-I mean back.

1199
01:00:34,587 --> 01:00:36,023
You know, to the hotel.

1200
01:00:37,111 --> 01:00:39,679
Um... Harry, listen to me,

1201
01:00:40,811 --> 01:00:42,987
write whatever
you want, you know.

1202
01:00:43,117 --> 01:00:44,858
Just dig it out
of yourself, babe,

1203
01:00:44,989 --> 01:00:45,859
because that's where it is.

1204
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:48,470
It's all in there, okay?

1205
01:00:48,601 --> 01:00:49,646
Now, go for it.

1206
01:00:50,603 --> 01:00:51,735
