1
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:48,215
#Holdin' hands at midnight
'neath a starry sky #

2
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,051
# Nice work if you can get it #

3
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:54,513
# And you can get it
if you try #

4
00:00:55,180 --> 00:01:01,019
# Strollin' with that one girl,
sighin' sigh after sigh #

5
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,939
# Nice work if you can get it #

6
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:07,901
# And you can get it
if you try #

7
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:14,116
# Just imagine someone
waitin' at the cottage door #

8
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,201
# Where two hearts become one #

9
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:19,621
- # Who could ask
for anything more? #
- Mmm!

10
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:20,914
That looks good enough to eat.

11
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:22,624
Oh, thank you.

12
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,585
I wasn't talking about the cake.

13
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:27,337
Oh, Gordon. You're my cousin.

14
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:29,298
Never stopped
the Royal Family.

15
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,549
You're a very sick man.

16
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,010
Mm. Hi.

17
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,012
- Hi.
- You're yummy.

18
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:38,932
Oh, Mum, would you take Grandma
over to the church, please?

19
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:40,642
Yes. Come on, sweetheart.

20
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:42,102
So, do you wanna go and
tell Dennis that we're ready?

21
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,854
Sure thing.

22
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:44,938
How's he doing?

23
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,107
Oh, great. Thrilled.

24
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,694
I'm telling you, he's thrilled.

25
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,871
Dennis, it's Gordon.
Are you ready?

26
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:07,628
Wow! You look great!

27
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,048
So, are you ready?

28
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,633
Um...

29
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,385
- Just...
- OK.

30
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:17,804
I'm gonna give you a minute
to, uh...

31
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,348
give you a minute.

32
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:28,065
No, no. I don't want to.

33
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,526
Done want to, ah...

34
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:35,614
Dennis!

35
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:38,659
It's time.
Dennis, we have to go.

36
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,661
Dennis!

37
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:42,829
Dennis!

38
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:48,919
# Where to promise
to love one... #

39
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:52,506
Dennis, we're gonna have a baby.

40
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,510
Dennis.

41
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,304
Dennis?

42
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:04,184
# Who could ask
for anything more? #

43
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,443
Aw, shit.

44
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,201
Dennis!

45
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,330
Dennis!

46
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:28,667
# I'm sorry, sorry, sorry
if you're gettin' me wrong #

47
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,461
# But you're half a world away
with only one sock on #

48
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:34,464
# Now you're gettin' too much,
I don't want to play along #

49
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:37,301
# 'Cause all I really wanted
was a radio song #

50
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,969
# What is there to say #

51
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:40,095
# What is there to say?

52
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,513
# In a world so grey? #

53
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:42,639
# In a world so grey #

54
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:47,603
# Why, oh, why, oh, why
are we singing it anyway? #

55
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,521
- Come on!
- # 'Cause you think I had #

56
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,356
- # A wind-up heart #
- Stop!

57
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:54,109
- # Then you must have had plastic head #
- Come back!

58
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:56,278
- # Did you think I had to play the part? #
- Give me a break!

59
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,239
# When you copied everyhing I said? #

60
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,950
- # When the tide of love is out and the rust begins to show #
- Whoo!

61
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,285
# You're cryin' in your sleep #

62
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:04,411
# Scared of your shadow #

63
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:05,704
- # If you thought this was forever #
- Ooh!

64
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,831
- Oh!
- # Dear, I'm keeping you in mind #

65
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,041
Gotcha. Where is it?

66
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,125
Where's what?

67
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,168
You know what I'm talkin' about!

68
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,419
Ooh! Hey! Hey!

69
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:13,504
Ooh!

70
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:14,588
All right!

71
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,672
What do you
think this is, huh?

72
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:17,007
I've never seen those
before in my life.

73
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:19,009
Yeah, and you're
a fit, running type.

74
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:20,177
You bastard.

75
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:21,261
Don't.

76
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:22,387
Little shit!

77
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:23,597
There's nothing to see here,
people.

78
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,140
Ow!

79
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,149
Where's the bra?

80
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,692
What bra?

81
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:38,403
Whoo!

82
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,405
Come on, fat boy, run!

83
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,740
I'm not fat!

84
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,825
I'm just-- I'm unfit.

85
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,328
Go on, then.

86
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:49,873
Ow!

87
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:27,202
Yes?

88
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,621
Could you let me in, please,
Mr G?

89
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:33,083
Who the hell are you?

90
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,210
You-- Why are we--

91
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,421
It's Dennis Doyle
from downstairs.

92
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,423
Dennis Doyle from downstairs
is dead...

93
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,674
killed by his landlord.

94
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:41,967
- Do you know why?
- No.

95
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:45,137
Failure to pay the rent
in a timely fashion.

96
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:46,346
Dennis!

97
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:47,973
Hey, Maya.
Listen, can you tell your dad...

98
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:49,057
I'm in a bit of a hurry?

99
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:51,518
- Have you got any money?
- Maya, go inside!

100
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:55,480
And put something on.

101
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:58,108
Hello. Hello.

102
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,027
Yes?

103
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,153
Do you know what happened
to that landlord...

104
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,322
after he killed Dennis Doyle
from downstairs?

105
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,532
- No.
- They gave him a medal...

106
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:08,869
and a nice foot massage.

107
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:12,122
Hey, Mr Ghoshdashtidar.

108
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:14,917
Mr Ghoshdashtidar, wait--

109
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,057
Well, how is the old rascal?

110
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:33,268
I hear it's going to be a party
of special magnificence.

111
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,520
You know Bilbo.

112
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,063
He's got
the whole place in an uproar.

113
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,190
Mm. Ah, well,
that should please him.

114
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:41,902
Jake, your dad's gonna be here
in a minute.

115
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:43,153
You ready?

116
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:44,821
Ready!

117
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:47,616
All right,
then keep your secrets.

118
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:51,119
Hey.

119
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:53,038
- # You give me tone #
- Hey.

120
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,165
# I'll like that #

121
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:57,042
Hey, how is it goin'?

122
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:59,044
- Oh, yeah.
- # All the chrome #

123
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,171
# Well, I'll like that #

124
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:03,632
Dennis. Yeah, Dennis.

125
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:04,883
# Do you run away? #

126
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,469
You like, uh, to have some sort
of drink with me?

127
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:09,304
Oh, what the hell. Let's--

128
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:13,475
Ow, shit!

129
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:14,810
Oh!

130
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:16,270
- Hah!
- Aah!

131
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,397
No. Oh, you got me!

132
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,274
- Hi.
- Hi.

133
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:21,608
- We're playing
hobbits and orcs.
- Mm-hmm.

134
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,277
Guess who's an orc?

135
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,029
Honey, would you mind, uh...

136
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,198
This kind of smarts. Can you?

137
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,366
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

138
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:30,701
I'm not finished
with you, Whit!

139
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,202
Yeah, one sec.

140
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:33,662
Uh, I thought his dad
was picking him up.

141
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:35,831
- What happened?
- Oh, what happened?

142
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:36,999
Dennis happened.

143
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,084
Mmm. Well, on the bright side...

144
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,545
- Hmm?
- you look astonishingly
beautiful today.

145
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:43,088
- Whit!
- Really.

146
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,137
Where have you been?

147
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:51,638
Hey.

148
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,806
- I was--
- Daddy!

149
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:54,641
Hey, snot-face!

150
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,101
Oh, please, don't call him that.

151
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,561
Why?
He is a snot-face, isn't he?

152
00:07:57,603 --> 00:07:59,438
You are a snot-face,
aren't you? Huh?

153
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,731
Oh.

154
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:01,815
Aw!

155
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:03,483
Jake, that's disgusting.

156
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:05,360
Jake, that's disgusting.
Go on.

157
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:07,779
- Toilet first.
- Mom!

158
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,616
Go on. Grab your jacket.

159
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,244
You were supposed to be here
an hour ago, Dennis.

160
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:15,829
Yeah, there was a bit
of a mix-up with the--

161
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,581
with the tickets, so...

162
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:18,790
Hey, you look really nice.

163
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,000
Did I get you that necklace?

164
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:22,252
No. It was a...

165
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:24,671
just a present
from someone...else.

166
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,924
- Who?
- Uh, me, actually.

167
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,008
Oh, yeah.

168
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,092
Huh?

169
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,844
It belonged to my grandmother.

170
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:32,346
Yeah.

171
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:34,223
Huh?

172
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,518
Dennis, this is
my good friend, Whit.

173
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,729
Whit, this is my--
Jake's dad, Dennis.

174
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:42,523
How you doin'?

175
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,525
Good, yeah.
You have soft hands.

176
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,193
Do you moisturize?

177
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,237
I do, actually.

178
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:50,781
Well, it's very nice
to meet you.

179
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,783
It's nice to finally put a face
to the name.

180
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:53,867
I'd have probably thought
you'd have...

181
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:55,827
you would have seen
one of our photos.

182
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:57,913
Oh, there aren't any.

183
00:08:58,205 --> 00:08:59,331
- Hmm.
- Ready?

184
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:01,375
Yes. Let's go.

185
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,668
- Have fun.
- Yeah.

186
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,712
Dennis, you do have
the tickets, right?

187
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:08,966
Libby, credit me
with some intelligence.

188
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,305
Tickets!

189
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:17,516
Does anybody have any tickets?

190
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:18,892
Mate, my daughter's
not very well.

191
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:20,269
I've got a couple of
spare tickets if you want 'em.

192
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,854
Yes. Thank you so much.
How much?

193
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,021
Oh, whatever.

194
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,940
Uh, this is
all the money I have.

195
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,067
Yeah?

196
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:28,443
My son is gonna love me.

197
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,487
You want your son to love you?
Don't break the law.

198
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:32,489
Hey, that's entrapment!

199
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:34,199
Oh, God!

200
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,410
And that's brutality!

201
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:41,415
Libby, it's--
It was only a caution.

202
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,293
No. Uh, Libby, I'll--

203
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:45,836
- Bye, Dad.
- Libby.

204
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:00,517
So, do you work with Libby
at the bakery?

205
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:02,978
No.

206
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:04,688
We met at the bakery, though.

207
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,648
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

208
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,483
What?

209
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,903
No, I just was
a nervous wreck that day.

210
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,237
It took me
four chocolate eclairs...

211
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:15,449
and a macaroon just to get up
the courage to talk to her.

212
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:20,787
Uh, no, I work in
the financial district actually.

213
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,749
I'm a hedge fund manager
for Waterman Hughes.

214
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,083
Oh.

215
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,461
I do high-level security
analysis and operation...

216
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:28,962
for an upscale retail outlet.

217
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:30,422
Really?

218
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:32,299
Libby said
you were a security guard...

219
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:33,592
at a women's clothing store.

220
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,719
Yeah, that's what I said.

221
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:37,971
Right.

222
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:40,182
Uh, well, l--
I should probably get a cab.

223
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:41,934
I got a big run in the morning.

224
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,519
A big what?

225
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,480
A run-- I'm training for
the Nike River Run next month.

226
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:47,564
The what-y what what?

227
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:48,899
The Nike River Run.

228
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:52,069
It's a-- It's a marathon race
along the, uh, Thames River.

229
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,154
Why would you do that?

230
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:56,073
Uh, well, it's
a charity thing, you know?

231
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,157
Plus, I love to run.

232
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:59,952
I actually ran the London
Marathon a little while ago.

233
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,036
Oh, that's a coincidence.

234
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:02,120
Oh, yeah? How's that?

235
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,664
I watched it on the television.

236
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:04,831
- Ah.
- Well, the last hour.

237
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:06,959
I sleep in on a Sunday, so...

238
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:09,127
Right.

239
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,588
Um, well, look, you know...

240
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,757
I know these things can be
pretty awkward, you know?

241
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:15,342
I mean, you know,
you're Jake's dad...

242
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:18,846
and, uh, well,
I just want you to know...

243
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:24,726
that I like Libby and Jake
very, very much...

244
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:28,939
and, um, well, I just appreciate
your being so grown up...

245
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:30,566
about this, you know?

246
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:31,859
Hey! Yo!

247
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,193
You wanna take this one?

248
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:34,444
- No, you have it.
- You sure?

249
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:35,779
Yeah. I'll get the next one.

250
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:37,322
All right.
Very nice to meet you.

251
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,991
- Yeah.
- I'm sure I'll see you around.

252
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,909
Yup. Hope so.

253
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:44,204
Hello, good sir.
West lndia Quay, please.

254
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,374
- Bye.
- Bye.

255
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,293
- See ya.
- Bye-bye.

256
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:19,281
Dennis!

257
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:22,451
Dennis!

258
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:26,663
Dennis?

259
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:29,208
- Close your eyes.
- Huh?

260
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,168
- Close your eyes.
- Oh.

261
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,424
OK. Open them.
Happy Valentine's.

262
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:41,053
That's great.

263
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:10,749
Dennis!

264
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,544
Dennis!

265
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:28,892
Hi.

266
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:14,938
Hey, Vincent.

267
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:17,441
- Dennis.
- How's business?

268
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:18,567
Whatcha mean, "business"?

269
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:20,152
Sorry.

270
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:25,449
- Got it.
- Shh.

271
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,575
Hush now, man.

272
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:28,327
All right.

273
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:33,790
Three thousand.

274
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,463
This is all I've got.

275
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:41,798
Just throw whatever you have
in the pot.

276
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,926
OK.

277
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,552
Flush, king high.

278
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:50,807
Ace high.

279
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:58,357
What happened?

280
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:03,111
Bad luck, mate.

281
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:04,905
Oh.

282
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:07,282
Oh, hey, I got you
those tickets.

283
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:08,825
They were for yesterday.

284
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:09,910
What?
So now you don't want 'em?

285
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:11,787
Why would I want them?

286
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,456
Put them on eBay.

287
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:15,749
Who's gonna wanna buy tickets...

288
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,167
for something
that happened yesterday?

289
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:18,836
- Time travellers.
- Where were you?

290
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:21,171
My whole night
was just screwed, man...

291
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:24,258
and I looked like a prick in
front of Libby's new boyfriend.

292
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:26,176
Oh, she didn't tell me
she has a new boyfriend.

293
00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:27,761
What's he like?

294
00:15:28,387 --> 00:15:30,097
Handsome, well-off, friendly.

295
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:33,267
He's like Peter Perfect
out of Wacky Races...

296
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:34,977
and he runs marathons.

297
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:37,938
- Why?
- Exactly.

298
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,695
Well, look, my only
serious relationship ended...

299
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:47,155
in a broken collarbone
and a dead meerkat...

300
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:49,199
so I may not be the best person
in the world to give advice...

301
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:51,827
but you have been trying
to get through to Libby...

302
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:53,745
for five years now...

303
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:56,415
so maybe you should let her go.

304
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,500
Yeah,
but what is her problem?

305
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:00,919
Dennis, you left her
at the altar...

306
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:02,546
when she was pregnant.

307
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:04,673
But that was ages ago.

308
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:08,093
Well, women remember that stuff.

309
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,304
Look, if there's anything else
I can do to help...

310
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:12,139
just let me know.

311
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:14,308
Well, actually, I am
a little bit behind in my rent.

312
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:15,934
I was wondering if you had
a couple of hundred quid...

313
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:17,895
I could maybe borrow.

314
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:28,739
Oh, I love you. I really do.

315
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,699
I needed that actually.

316
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:33,368
That's great. Thank you.
I'll see you later.

317
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:41,793
How about this one?

318
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:46,006
I bet you can't do it.

319
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:49,009
- I can do a big one.
- Go on.

320
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:53,180
Look, look, look, look, look.

321
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,185
That was a good one.

322
00:16:58,227 --> 00:16:59,728
Yeah.

323
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:01,146
Listen.

324
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:03,482
I'm really sorry about
gettin' you arrested yesterday.

325
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:04,566
That's all right.

326
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:05,984
Most universities
don't even look...

327
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:07,778
at things
like that these days.

328
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:09,738
Hey, another one.

329
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,532
As far as I'm concerned,
what else do you have?

330
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:13,242
- Oh, she was great.
- Yeah, well, she is--

331
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:15,035
Ooh!

332
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:16,912
- Shh.
- Sorry.

333
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:17,996
Um, but, yeah, so I think--

334
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,665
Do you want to hear a secret?

335
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:20,749
Absolutely.

336
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,626
There's a girl in my class
called Emily.

337
00:17:22,668 --> 00:17:24,503
Well, I'm sure
that's not a secret.

338
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:26,129
The teachers probably know
about her.

339
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:27,464
She looks like a tree frog.

340
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:28,549
She what?

341
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,175
She looks like a tree frog.

342
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:32,177
That's not
a very nice thing to say.

343
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:33,595
I like tree frogs.

344
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:34,805
Oh, yeah?

345
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:36,348
More than hobbits?

346
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:39,685
I see.

347
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,979
I really feel
we can make a life together.

348
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,355
"You really think we could--"

349
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:45,357
Wait, that sounds like something
Whit would say.

350
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:46,817
He did say it.

351
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:48,986
- What? To Mom?
- Yes.

352
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:50,279
What a shithead.

353
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,363
Dad!

354
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:52,906
Sorry.

355
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:56,451
Listen, I'm really glad
you were such a big boy...

356
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:57,953
about not gettin'
into the whole...

357
00:17:57,995 --> 00:17:59,204
Lord of the Rings thing,
you know?

358
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:00,289
That's OK.

359
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,832
Whit's got us front row seats
for tomorrow...

360
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:03,083
so it's even better.

361
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,626
What a shithead.

362
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:06,128
Dad!

363
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,629
Well.

364
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:14,845
# Ah, yeah #

365
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:19,016
# Oh, yeah #

366
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:22,644
# I'm up
on the eleventh floor #

367
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:25,647
# And I'm watchin'
the cruisers below #

368
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:29,443
# He's down on the street #

369
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:32,613
# And he's tryin' hard
to pull sister Flo #

370
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:36,700
# Oh, my heart's
in the basement #

371
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:39,870
# My weekend's
at an all-time low #

372
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:43,415
# 'Cause she's hopin' to score #

373
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:46,376
# So I can't see her
letting him go #

374
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:49,505
# You betcha #

375
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:51,381
# Oh, yeah #

376
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:53,550
# Uh-huh #

377
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:00,849
Deliveries are downstairs.

378
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:03,060
- No, I'm--
- Waterman Hughes.

379
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:08,232
- Yes?
- Bonjour.

380
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:14,279
Whit!

381
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:18,450
Thanks for your help.

382
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:20,786
So, what brings you
down here, man?

383
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:23,038
A little, uh, high-level
security analysis...

384
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,456
in retail operation?

385
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:25,624
Huh?

386
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,626
What can I do for you?
I'm just on my way to the gym.

387
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:30,087
- I got a spin class.
- Huh?

388
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:32,381
Spinning?
You know, spinning, bicycles?

389
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:33,465
Oh, OK.

390
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:35,676
No, I was thinking more
along the lines of a pint.

391
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:37,511
A pint? Oh, a pint.

392
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:39,471
Uh, wow.

393
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:41,348
Um, I'd love a pint, actually...

394
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,891
but, uh, I really gotta hit
this class.

395
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:44,476
I'm in training, you know?

396
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:45,894
You wanna come along?

397
00:19:45,936 --> 00:19:47,604
Uh, it's an amazing workout.

398
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:49,731
I-- I'd love to, but I don't
have any gear, so--

399
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:51,275
Well, I'll lend you some.

400
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:53,110
Great.

401
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:55,112
Three, two, one!

402
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:56,738
We're climbing!
Rhythm is up!

403
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:00,868
Push! Push! Push! Push!

404
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:02,452
Keep it up!

405
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:04,288
No cheating! Let's go!

406
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:05,747
How you doin' there?
You all right?

407
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:06,832
What'd you say?

408
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:09,376
Out of the saddle!
We're climbing!

409
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:13,213
OK,
let's make it really hard!

410
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:16,884
So, what did you wanna
talk to me about, man?

411
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:20,971
Ow!

412
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,141
Jake said you had some tickets
to the, uh...

413
00:20:24,183 --> 00:20:25,809
to the hobbit musical.

414
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:27,686
Yeah, a friend of mine's
an investor in the show.

415
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:29,771
He totally hooked me up.
Can you believe that?

416
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:32,649
Hmm...um...

417
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:34,818
I was just thinking, um...

418
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,861
you know,
you don't really wanna sit...

419
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:39,072
through a whole sort of
three-hour kind of show, do you?

420
00:20:39,114 --> 00:20:42,743
- So...
- Well, the thing is...

421
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:44,578
Oh.

422
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:47,414
Jake's really kind of got
his heart set on this, you know?

423
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:48,957
Yeah.

424
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,834
- Powder?
- I'm fine.

425
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:52,127
You sure? Refreshing.

426
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:53,879
I would imagine it is.

427
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:57,090
I was just-- I'm thinkin' maybe,
you know, if you like...

428
00:20:57,132 --> 00:20:59,801
then I could maybe take Jake
and Libby for you, you know...

429
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:02,012
if--if you want.

430
00:21:02,054 --> 00:21:05,098
Look, I know you must be
kind of angry at yourself...

431
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,100
for messing up with the tickets
the other night...

432
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:08,644
and, uh, I'd like to help you.

433
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:10,938
I really would, but, um...

434
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:13,065
Well, the thing is...

435
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:15,734
I hope to be more and more
a part of Jake's life, you know?

436
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:19,321
And, uh, frankly, I'm kind
of looking forward to this show.

437
00:21:19,363 --> 00:21:21,865
Give Jake and l, a chance to get
to know each other better.

438
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:24,743
I mean, uh, you can see
my point, can't you?

439
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:26,870
Yes, I can.

440
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:30,207
So, can I ask you a question?

441
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:31,416
Sure.

442
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:34,086
You had her once,
why did you ever let her go?

443
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:35,170
To be honest, Whit--

444
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:37,214
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'd just
be careful on the stairs here.

445
00:21:37,256 --> 00:21:39,091
Your legs
might be a little rubbery.

446
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,051
I'm fine.

447
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:45,722
Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.

448
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:47,099
I'm fine. I'm--

449
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,226
Yeah, the first step
is often the, uh...

450
00:21:49,268 --> 00:21:50,769
the difficult one.

451
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:52,896
This is Libby.
Leave me a message.

452
00:21:52,938 --> 00:21:55,482
Hey, Lib, it's me.
Can you give me a ring?

453
00:22:04,074 --> 00:22:06,827
Fuck!

454
00:22:14,543 --> 00:22:15,711
Who the hell are you?

455
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:17,421
Just open the bloody door.

456
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:19,089
OK.

457
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:06,553
- There you go. Enjoy.
- Thank you.

458
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:08,555
- Forty-eight.
- Yes.

459
00:23:08,597 --> 00:23:09,681
Hello.

460
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:11,266
Dennis, I'm really busy.

461
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:12,434
Can we talk?

462
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:14,686
No, just buy something or go.

463
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:18,815
OK. I, can I have one of your
signature cupcakes, please?

464
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:21,109
Actually,
can I have this big one?

465
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:22,194
- Dennis.
- That one's fine...

466
00:23:22,236 --> 00:23:24,446
and, uh, I like that one, too.

467
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:27,282
- Anything else?
- Um, yeah.

468
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:28,951
What do you see in Whit?

469
00:23:28,992 --> 00:23:31,662
- Uh, forty-nine.
- Yes, I'm forty-nine.

470
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:33,580
- What can I get for you?
- No, I'm not done yet.

471
00:23:33,622 --> 00:23:34,831
Yes, you are.

472
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:37,125
Sorry, I think you've used up
your allotted time.

473
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:39,920
You don't-- You don't have
allotted time, OK?

474
00:23:39,962 --> 00:23:41,630
Now you're using up
my allotted time.

475
00:23:41,672 --> 00:23:43,382
You don't get
allotted time, OK?

476
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:44,716
It's not like a game show,
you know?

477
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:47,302
You got, like, fifteen seconds
to win a bun.

478
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:49,179
Goodbye, Dennis.

479
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:50,264
Yes?

480
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:52,349
Yes. Hello, yes.

481
00:23:52,391 --> 00:23:55,811
Um, do you have any of those
little gingerbread rabbits?

482
00:23:55,853 --> 00:23:57,229
Oh, no.
We just have those at Easter.

483
00:23:57,271 --> 00:23:58,480
I'm so sorry.

484
00:23:58,522 --> 00:23:59,982
Oh.

485
00:24:00,691 --> 00:24:02,401
Hmm...

486
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:09,575
Do you have anything else
shaped like an animal?

487
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:10,659
- Excuse me.
- What?

488
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:13,078
I haven't paid for my order.

489
00:24:13,245 --> 00:24:14,329
I'm sorry.

490
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:15,414
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

491
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:17,332
Excuse me.

492
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:20,502
- Ow!
- Sorry.

493
00:24:21,587 --> 00:24:23,172
Seriously,
what do you see in him?

494
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:25,048
OK, he's well-off, all right?

495
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,717
He's kind of-- He's quite
good-looking, you know?

496
00:24:26,758 --> 00:24:27,843
But I mean, so what?

497
00:24:27,885 --> 00:24:29,428
Is that what you think
this is about?

498
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:31,513
I just want
some gorgeous sugar daddy.

499
00:24:31,555 --> 00:24:32,848
I wouldn't say gorgeous.

500
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:34,183
Well,
that's not why I'm with him.

501
00:24:34,224 --> 00:24:35,434
Well, why are you with him?

502
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:36,643
You know,
give me one good reason.

503
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:38,687
One? I could give you fifty.

504
00:24:38,729 --> 00:24:41,023
- I'm fifty!
- Hang on a minute!

505
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:44,484
He's mature, responsible,
considerate...

506
00:24:44,526 --> 00:24:45,861
he's great with Jake.

507
00:24:45,903 --> 00:24:47,905
- That's only four.
- Hello?

508
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:50,574
You know what?
He's a good man, Dennis.

509
00:24:50,616 --> 00:24:53,243
You know, he runs marathons
for charity, for Pete's sake.

510
00:24:53,285 --> 00:24:54,828
Oh, big deal!

511
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,747
So you could run a marathon?

512
00:24:56,788 --> 00:24:59,041
Could I have
a chocolate brownie, please?

513
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:00,542
- Hang on!
- Oh!

514
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:02,336
Look, Libby, I can change.

515
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:04,922
Yeah? Well, great.
Let's get married.

516
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:06,465
- Really?
- No!

517
00:25:06,507 --> 00:25:08,592
We tried that once, remember?

518
00:25:08,634 --> 00:25:11,053
You left me at the altar,
pregnant.

519
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:12,971
You cock!

520
00:25:13,347 --> 00:25:14,890
Look, Libby, I can change, OK?

521
00:25:14,932 --> 00:25:16,934
I have changed. I can prove it.

522
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:18,810
How?

523
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,732
I'll tell you.
I will run the marathon.

524
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,610
What?

525
00:25:26,652 --> 00:25:27,694
The one that Whit's doin'...

526
00:25:27,736 --> 00:25:29,696
I'll run that,
and I'll finish it.

527
00:25:29,738 --> 00:25:30,864
Come on,
you've never finished...

528
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:33,116
anything in your entire life,
Dennis.

529
00:25:33,158 --> 00:25:35,244
Oh, now, you-- That's not--

530
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:36,954
- You know--
- Look, You can't
even finish a sentence.

531
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:38,038
Don't--don't--

532
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,790
You're just bein',
you know, what's the word?

533
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:40,874
Cock?

534
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:43,085
I would settle for something
shaped like a fish.

535
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:44,169
Well, go to the fishmonger!

536
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:46,046
I'm a vegetarian.

537
00:25:46,088 --> 00:25:48,298
OK. OK.

538
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,883
Dennis, just please leave.

539
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:52,261
OK. OK, I'll go.

540
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:53,762
But I'm gonna
prove this to you, Libby.

541
00:25:53,804 --> 00:25:57,516
I can be mature, considerate,
and responsible.

542
00:25:59,101 --> 00:26:00,269
- Oh!
- Dennis?

543
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,895
Yes, Libby?

544
00:26:02,855 --> 00:26:04,481
It's two pounds, seventy-five.

545
00:26:04,523 --> 00:26:06,483
Oh, yeah, right.

546
00:26:07,526 --> 00:26:09,152
Hey, if Dennis thinks
he can run the race...

547
00:26:09,194 --> 00:26:10,279
he can run the race.

548
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,780
- Thank you.
- There's no way

549
00:26:11,822 --> 00:26:13,407
you can run a marathon.

550
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:16,076
- Why not?
- 'Cause you is a lazy bastard.

551
00:26:16,118 --> 00:26:18,161
Hey, I'll have you know
I go to spin classes.

552
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:19,913
You went to one.

553
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:22,082
Yeah, and now
you walk like John Wayne.

554
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:24,793
Hey, this is important to me.

555
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:27,004
I mean it!

556
00:26:27,045 --> 00:26:31,175
Look, I'm sick of
being a nearly man, all right?

557
00:26:31,216 --> 00:26:32,259
I'm sick of being scared.

558
00:26:32,301 --> 00:26:33,635
I'm sick of the regret
I feel every day...

559
00:26:33,677 --> 00:26:36,346
'cause I didn't have the guts
to marry the woman I love!

560
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:40,058
All that ends
tomorrow at 6 A.M.

561
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:20,474
# Ow! #

562
00:27:41,453 --> 00:27:42,913
Not bad.

563
00:27:59,388 --> 00:28:00,889
Hi.

564
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:03,809
Feel better?

565
00:28:03,851 --> 00:28:05,310
Much.

566
00:28:05,352 --> 00:28:07,896
Oh, how was spin class?

567
00:28:09,273 --> 00:28:12,234
Uh, it was...
It was an amazing workout.

568
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:14,403
Is that right?

569
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:16,029
Yeah. And I also thought
it would be...

570
00:28:16,071 --> 00:28:17,990
a good chance for me
to get to know Whit...

571
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:19,700
a little bit better, so...

572
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:21,910
Well, maybe we should all go out
for dinner then.

573
00:28:21,952 --> 00:28:23,203
- You think?
- Yeah.

574
00:28:23,245 --> 00:28:24,955
And then we could go dancing.

575
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:26,957
- You're jokin'.
- No, not at all.

576
00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:29,501
And then, afterwards,
we could come back here...

577
00:28:29,543 --> 00:28:31,211
and have a threesome.

578
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:33,839
Oh. You are joking.

579
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:35,174
Of course, I am.

580
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:36,466
Look, Dennis, I don't know
what's going on...

581
00:28:36,508 --> 00:28:37,843
in that head of yours,
but whatever it is...

582
00:28:37,885 --> 00:28:39,553
- I don't like it.
- I've-- There's nothing--

583
00:28:39,595 --> 00:28:41,430
- Daddy!
- Hey, buddy.

584
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:42,556
- You ready for school?
- Yeah.

585
00:28:42,598 --> 00:28:45,058
Wait up, wait up, wait up a sec.

586
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:48,103
Can I walk with you guys?

587
00:28:48,145 --> 00:28:49,646
OK.

588
00:28:50,397 --> 00:28:52,232
- I'll see you later.
- OK.

589
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:55,319
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

590
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:56,904
All right, you ready?

591
00:28:56,945 --> 00:28:58,447
Yeah.

592
00:29:05,204 --> 00:29:08,916
So, Whit, you were, uh, 'round
at Libby's pretty early, eh?

593
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:10,542
Whit stayed over last night.

594
00:29:10,584 --> 00:29:11,877
- Oh?
- Yes.

595
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,504
They were jumping on the bed.

596
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:15,881
Wow.

597
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:20,761
Hey, Jakey, guess what?
Uh, I spoke to my friend...

598
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:22,888
and he does have an extra ticket
for the show tonight.

599
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:25,557
What do you say
we, uh, ask Emily to come along?

600
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:27,100
Yeah!

601
00:29:27,142 --> 00:29:29,102
- Yay.
- What, he told you about Emily?

602
00:29:29,144 --> 00:29:30,646
Oh, yeah.

603
00:29:31,396 --> 00:29:32,564
Oh, and, uh...

604
00:29:32,606 --> 00:29:35,609
Libby tells me that you
decided to run the marathon?

605
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:36,735
Yeah.

606
00:29:36,777 --> 00:29:39,071
That's great, man. Seriously.

607
00:29:39,112 --> 00:29:40,405
Really, that's awesome.

608
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:41,657
Thank you.

609
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:42,699
How did you manage to get in?

610
00:29:42,741 --> 00:29:43,784
What do you mean?

611
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:45,410
Well, you can't
just show up and run.

612
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:46,495
Well, why not?

613
00:29:46,537 --> 00:29:48,288
You have to apply in advance.

614
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:49,957
Well, how far in advance?

615
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:51,500
Uh, three months.

616
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:52,584
And when is it again?

617
00:29:52,626 --> 00:29:54,086
Three weeks.

618
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:55,170
Right.

619
00:29:55,212 --> 00:29:56,547
They'll make exceptions
sometimes...

620
00:29:56,588 --> 00:29:58,966
if you're running for a charity,
but, uh, you know...

621
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:01,844
each charity is only allowed
a certain amount of runners.

622
00:30:01,885 --> 00:30:03,345
No, you don't have to worry
about me.

623
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:04,596
I'll get in.

624
00:30:04,638 --> 00:30:06,056
All right.

625
00:30:06,098 --> 00:30:08,225
You ever, uh,
run a marathon before?

626
00:30:08,267 --> 00:30:09,935
No. Why?

627
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:11,812
It's pretty gruelling.

628
00:30:11,854 --> 00:30:14,648
Well, yeah, that's why
they call it a marathon.

629
00:30:15,816 --> 00:30:17,860
Yeah, actually, technically,
it's called a marathon...

630
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:20,404
because of the events
of 490 B.C.

631
00:30:20,445 --> 00:30:21,989
There was a Greek soldier...

632
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,073
- named Phei--
- Say, can I just...

633
00:30:23,115 --> 00:30:25,117
- stop you there?
- Yeah.

634
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:28,078
I've got have nothing to say.
I just wanted to stop you there.

635
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:35,043
All right, all right.

636
00:30:35,794 --> 00:30:38,463
Hello. Is that
the Cats Protection League?

637
00:30:38,964 --> 00:30:40,007
Hello. I was just--

638
00:30:40,048 --> 00:30:41,383
I'm-- I'm running a marathon
next month...

639
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:43,719
and I was wondering if I could
possibly run on your behalf?

640
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:46,722
Great. Yeah, yeah.

641
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:49,349
OK. I see.

642
00:30:50,475 --> 00:30:52,311
How big is the costume?

643
00:30:53,103 --> 00:30:55,480
OK. I'll call you back.

644
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,358
Ooh.

645
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,902
Hi.

646
00:31:00,527 --> 00:31:01,862
- Dennis.
- Oh, yes?

647
00:31:01,904 --> 00:31:03,822
Would you mind not doing that
in front of the customers?

648
00:31:03,864 --> 00:31:06,074
Sorry. I went for a run
this morning in my trunks...

649
00:31:06,116 --> 00:31:07,784
and I think
I've got a bit of a rash...

650
00:31:07,826 --> 00:31:09,578
you know,
down there in the, uh...

651
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,371
- I understand.
- scrotal zone.

652
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:13,498
- I understand, Dennis.
- OK.

653
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:16,293
Please, keep your hands
out of the scrotal zone...

654
00:31:16,335 --> 00:31:17,503
whilst you're at work.

655
00:31:17,544 --> 00:31:19,087
Will do.

656
00:31:56,834 --> 00:31:58,377
Shh.

657
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:00,712
Dennis!

658
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,341
Sorry. I was, um...

659
00:32:05,634 --> 00:32:07,135
I was in the zone.

660
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:13,141
So, um, I'd actually
be dressed as a brain.

661
00:32:13,183 --> 00:32:15,853
Um, can I call you back?

662
00:32:24,945 --> 00:32:27,155
# Just 'cause you think it #

663
00:32:27,197 --> 00:32:29,575
# It don't make it so #

664
00:32:29,616 --> 00:32:32,286
# Drive you to drink #

665
00:32:32,327 --> 00:32:34,913
# Won't let you go #

666
00:32:34,955 --> 00:32:39,251
# Plenty of girls
and boys in love #

667
00:32:39,293 --> 00:32:40,335
Come on!

668
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:42,713
# Plenty of girls #

669
00:32:43,964 --> 00:32:46,258
# And boys in love #

670
00:32:49,303 --> 00:32:51,722
Would you like a cup of tea,
Dennis?

671
00:32:56,018 --> 00:32:58,103
So that's it.

672
00:32:58,145 --> 00:32:59,479
Running this marathon
could be my last chance...

673
00:32:59,521 --> 00:33:01,607
to show Libby that I can change.

674
00:33:04,735 --> 00:33:06,320
Mmm.

675
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:10,365
You know what I would do
if I were you?

676
00:33:10,407 --> 00:33:11,408
What?

677
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:14,286
I would get some cream
for that rash.

678
00:33:15,662 --> 00:33:17,789
Let me ask you something,
Dennis.

679
00:33:17,831 --> 00:33:21,877
Why did you leave your lady at
the altar when she was pregnant?

680
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,670
I don't know.
Just wasn't ready.

681
00:33:25,589 --> 00:33:30,552
The toothpaste was already
out of the tube, my friend.

682
00:33:30,844 --> 00:33:33,555
Being ready
had nothing to do with it.

683
00:33:34,515 --> 00:33:35,933
I was scared.

684
00:33:35,974 --> 00:33:37,476
Mmm.

685
00:33:38,227 --> 00:33:40,145
So, you are a coward.

686
00:33:40,979 --> 00:33:43,023
I thought we were just
gonna have a cup of tea.

687
00:33:44,483 --> 00:33:47,110
You did not think
you were good enough.

688
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:50,322
Am I right?

689
00:33:50,364 --> 00:33:52,533
You thought of your lady,
and you were terrified...

690
00:33:52,574 --> 00:33:54,159
you could not give her
what she needed...

691
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:55,994
what she deserved.

692
00:33:57,538 --> 00:33:59,248
I thought the same things...

693
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:02,793
on the day I married
Mrs Ghoshdashtidar.

694
00:34:04,127 --> 00:34:05,671
May she rest.

695
00:34:07,005 --> 00:34:08,465
Did you?

696
00:34:08,507 --> 00:34:10,425
Yes. But guess what?

697
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:13,554
It turned out
I was good enough.

698
00:34:13,595 --> 00:34:15,764
I made myself good enough.

699
00:34:16,974 --> 00:34:19,226
You did a stupid thing, Dennis.

700
00:34:19,351 --> 00:34:24,106
But she loved you once, and you
must have earned that somehow.

701
00:34:27,025 --> 00:34:28,819
Yeah.

702
00:34:29,862 --> 00:34:32,865
Did you have a good marriage,
Mr Ghoshdashtidar?

703
00:34:32,906 --> 00:34:34,616
Ah.

704
00:34:36,326 --> 00:34:39,371
I remember the feeling
of being complete...

705
00:34:39,705 --> 00:34:44,293
of spending every day
with my best friend...

706
00:34:44,334 --> 00:34:46,170
but most of all...

707
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:52,176
I remember all the fucking.

708
00:34:56,555 --> 00:34:58,390
Mmm...

709
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,852
Mmm...

710
00:35:04,855 --> 00:35:07,107
Oh, three degrees starboard,
skipper.

711
00:35:07,149 --> 00:35:08,734
Hey, I'm the captain.

712
00:35:08,775 --> 00:35:12,070
Mutiny! Mutiny!

713
00:35:13,572 --> 00:35:14,990
Whoa!

714
00:35:15,032 --> 00:35:18,076
Ahoy there, me lad.

715
00:35:19,286 --> 00:35:21,121
- Oh!
- Hey, Jakey.

716
00:35:21,163 --> 00:35:22,206
Sorry, we're late, love.

717
00:35:22,247 --> 00:35:23,874
Soon as Whit found out
we we're meeting here...

718
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:25,792
he had to go get his vessel.

719
00:35:26,043 --> 00:35:27,544
Jakey, here.
Flip that switch.

720
00:35:27,586 --> 00:35:30,130
No, not that one. That one.

721
00:35:32,716 --> 00:35:34,468
Whoa! Can I steer it?

722
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,803
No.
But you can watch me steer it.

723
00:35:37,387 --> 00:35:38,889
Mutiny.

724
00:35:39,264 --> 00:35:41,099
Hey. You wanna?

725
00:35:43,769 --> 00:35:45,687
- Was he OK?
- Yeah, he's fine.

726
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:49,233
We had a really nice time
until Captain Bligh turned up.

727
00:35:49,274 --> 00:35:51,401
Whit just likes to take things
very seriously.

728
00:35:51,443 --> 00:35:54,071
Prepare to be boarded,
or feel the hot wrath...

729
00:35:54,112 --> 00:35:57,157
of Her Majesty's
royal fusillade!

730
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:00,118
Wait, don't touch that. Wait.

731
00:36:01,036 --> 00:36:02,538
Why won't you
let me steer it?

732
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:04,456
Uh, because it's mine.

733
00:36:04,498 --> 00:36:05,874
So, you're still gonna run
in this marathon?

734
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:07,084
Yes, absolutely.

735
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:08,710
It's gonna be great.

736
00:36:08,752 --> 00:36:10,671
You're gonna see
a whole new Dennis.

737
00:36:10,712 --> 00:36:12,089
Right, well,
I've been thinking about it...

738
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:14,466
and the thing is, I don't care.

739
00:36:14,508 --> 00:36:15,801
What do you mean?

740
00:36:15,843 --> 00:36:18,011
Dennis, what do you think
you're going to achieve?

741
00:36:18,053 --> 00:36:20,305
Do you honestly think
that running 26 miles...

742
00:36:20,347 --> 00:36:21,932
is just gonna wipe
the slate clean?

743
00:36:21,974 --> 00:36:23,183
Well, you might change your mind
when you see me...

744
00:36:23,225 --> 00:36:24,726
in jogging shorts.

745
00:36:28,146 --> 00:36:30,899
Look, Whit's having
a birthday party...

746
00:36:30,941 --> 00:36:31,984
for me in a couple of weeks...

747
00:36:32,025 --> 00:36:34,778
and it would mean a lot to Jake
if you came.

748
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,321
To Jake?

749
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:39,241
Hey!

750
00:36:40,826 --> 00:36:42,327
Hey!

751
00:36:43,287 --> 00:36:44,705
Hey!

752
00:36:44,746 --> 00:36:45,789
Hey, OK.

753
00:36:45,831 --> 00:36:46,915
Whose boat is this?

754
00:36:46,957 --> 00:36:49,501
Whose boat...is this?!

755
00:36:49,543 --> 00:36:52,963
Excuse me!
Is-- Is this your boat?!

756
00:36:54,047 --> 00:36:55,966
- No way!
- He's toast.

757
00:36:56,008 --> 00:36:57,509
He won't last.

758
00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:04,308
Would you like some pizza,
Dennis?

759
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:06,351
Oh. Yes, I would actually.
Thank you very much.

760
00:37:06,393 --> 00:37:07,477
- Ow!
- Come here.

761
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:10,105
What are you doing that--
Stop it.

762
00:37:10,731 --> 00:37:11,773
Are you still gonna do this?

763
00:37:11,815 --> 00:37:13,025
Are you still gonna
run the marathon?

764
00:37:13,066 --> 00:37:14,193
I want to, yes.

765
00:37:14,234 --> 00:37:15,736
Thank God.

766
00:37:17,446 --> 00:37:18,488
Why?

767
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:20,866
Because I just bet them
every penny I have.

768
00:37:20,908 --> 00:37:22,910
What? You bet on me?

769
00:37:23,285 --> 00:37:24,661
Dennis, you're my best friend.

770
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:26,955
I'm not gonna bet against you.

771
00:37:27,206 --> 00:37:28,665
Well, thank you.

772
00:37:28,707 --> 00:37:30,542
Not with these odds.

773
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:32,002
Well, what if I don't finish?

774
00:37:32,044 --> 00:37:33,837
Vincent'll kill you.

775
00:37:33,879 --> 00:37:35,130
Oh, you'll finish.

776
00:37:35,172 --> 00:37:36,924
How can you be so sure?

777
00:37:40,511 --> 00:37:45,516
Get up, get up, get up, get up,
get up, get up, get up!

778
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:49,478
So, you're gonna be my coach.

779
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,979
That's right.

780
00:37:51,021 --> 00:37:52,064
Why are you here?

781
00:37:52,105 --> 00:37:54,483
I'm the assistant coach.

782
00:37:54,525 --> 00:37:55,609
Why do you get
to be assistant coach?

783
00:37:55,651 --> 00:37:57,319
Because I have this spatula.

784
00:37:57,361 --> 00:37:58,904
Ow!

785
00:38:00,113 --> 00:38:01,156
Go on. Get running.

786
00:38:01,198 --> 00:38:03,825
Wait. Isn't there some sort
of special technique?

787
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,286
Yeah, you put one leg
in front of the other...

788
00:38:06,328 --> 00:38:08,830
over and over again really fast.

789
00:38:09,748 --> 00:38:10,874
Why are you here again?

790
00:38:10,916 --> 00:38:12,501
- Ow!
- Motivation.

791
00:38:12,543 --> 00:38:14,253
# I said, yeah #

792
00:38:14,294 --> 00:38:15,754
# I said, yeah #

793
00:38:15,796 --> 00:38:18,382
- # What they said #
- # What they said #

794
00:38:18,423 --> 00:38:19,925
- # Oh, I said, yeah #
- Lift your knees higher!

795
00:38:19,967 --> 00:38:21,009
- You're not gonna get...
- # Yeah, yeah #

796
00:38:21,051 --> 00:38:22,761
- anywhere like that!
- # It's what they said #

797
00:38:22,803 --> 00:38:25,097
- You've gotta slide more.
- # What they said #

798
00:38:25,305 --> 00:38:27,391
- # Do you believe I would
take something with me #
- Come on, Dennis!

799
00:38:27,432 --> 00:38:29,434
- You want to feel my spatula?!
- # And give it #

800
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:30,978
- No, I do not!
- # To the police man? #

801
00:38:31,019 --> 00:38:34,106
- Then run! Run like the wind!
- # I wouldn't do that #

802
00:38:34,314 --> 00:38:35,482
- # And if I do that #
- This is harder...

803
00:38:35,524 --> 00:38:37,359
- # I would say, "Sir" #
- for me, you know?

804
00:38:37,401 --> 00:38:38,902
# "Come on
and put the charge on me" #

805
00:38:38,944 --> 00:38:40,529
Ow!

806
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:42,364
# I wouldn't do that #

807
00:38:42,406 --> 00:38:45,742
- # No, I wouldn't do that #
- Come on, Dennis! Come on!

808
00:38:45,784 --> 00:38:48,495
- Lookin' good! Lookin' good!
- # I'm not a fool
to hurt myself #

809
00:38:48,537 --> 00:38:50,122
- Come on, Dennis.
Keep up the pace.
- # I was innocent #

810
00:38:50,163 --> 00:38:52,457
- Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.
- # Of what they done to me #

811
00:38:52,499 --> 00:38:54,501
# They was wrong #

812
00:38:54,543 --> 00:38:55,586
I think I got a blister.

813
00:38:55,627 --> 00:38:56,670
- # They were wrong #
- OK.

814
00:38:56,712 --> 00:38:58,046
Yeah, gently.

815
00:38:58,088 --> 00:38:59,590
All right.

816
00:39:01,133 --> 00:39:04,136
OK! Oh! All right.

817
00:39:04,178 --> 00:39:05,971
-ls it bad?
-No, it's not that bad.

818
00:39:06,013 --> 00:39:08,015
No. No. It's not.

819
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:11,476
Ohh! Oh, that's big.

820
00:39:13,562 --> 00:39:15,189
Look at that thing.

821
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:17,191
It's like a womb.

822
00:39:17,441 --> 00:39:18,609
Don't.

823
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:19,693
Hey, maybe there's a little man
in there...

824
00:39:19,735 --> 00:39:21,653
who looks just like you,
but he's really good at running.

825
00:39:21,695 --> 00:39:23,238
What are you talking about?!

826
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,531
It's just a thought.

827
00:39:24,573 --> 00:39:26,200
You're gonna have to pop it.

828
00:39:27,868 --> 00:39:29,328
No. No way.

829
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:30,954
Never pop
another man's pustule.

830
00:39:30,996 --> 00:39:32,623
Well, I'll do it then.
Give me the needle.

831
00:39:32,664 --> 00:39:34,416
That's the closest I could get.

832
00:39:35,792 --> 00:39:36,919
It's fine. I sterilized it.

833
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,462
In what?

834
00:39:39,963 --> 00:39:41,798
It's sterilized.

835
00:39:42,799 --> 00:39:44,885
OK, OK. Here we go.

836
00:39:48,722 --> 00:39:50,265
Ooh, you're gonna get it.

837
00:39:51,183 --> 00:39:52,684
Stick it in.

838
00:39:52,726 --> 00:39:53,977
- Pop it!
- I can't!

839
00:39:54,019 --> 00:39:55,604
- Why not?
- It's scary!

840
00:39:55,646 --> 00:39:56,939
Give it to me.

841
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,023
Just do it slow!

842
00:39:58,065 --> 00:39:59,191
- Do it-- Do it gently, OK?
- Yeah.

843
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:00,817
- Trust me.
- After three, OK?

844
00:40:00,859 --> 00:40:02,444
- OK.
- One.

845
00:40:06,657 --> 00:40:08,200
It's in it!

846
00:40:08,325 --> 00:40:10,118
Get it out!

847
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,787
Bloody take it out!

848
00:40:11,828 --> 00:40:13,622
- Hold still! Hold still!
- Get it!

849
00:40:21,296 --> 00:40:22,798
I'm so sorry.

850
00:40:23,215 --> 00:40:24,675
That's never happened before.

851
00:40:24,716 --> 00:40:26,552
Oh! Oh!

852
00:40:29,429 --> 00:40:31,014
I'm Catholic.

853
00:40:32,266 --> 00:40:33,767
That was the second
most disgusting fluid...

854
00:40:33,809 --> 00:40:35,477
I've ever had in my eye.

855
00:40:36,562 --> 00:40:37,813
Who's that?

856
00:40:37,855 --> 00:40:38,939
That's Mr G.

857
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:40,774
Get something nice on,
something respectable.

858
00:40:40,816 --> 00:40:42,317
Where we goin'?

859
00:41:02,421 --> 00:41:04,590
Every year,
literally hundreds of people...

860
00:41:04,631 --> 00:41:08,135
are affected by acute
neurocortical emphasitis...

861
00:41:08,177 --> 00:41:10,095
or Hapsburg Syndrome.

862
00:41:10,137 --> 00:41:11,180
I see.

863
00:41:11,221 --> 00:41:14,057
And how does the condition
manifest itself?

864
00:41:14,516 --> 00:41:15,601
The syndrome
is characterized...

865
00:41:15,642 --> 00:41:17,853
by a loss
of lower body function...

866
00:41:19,313 --> 00:41:22,441
sporadic and often violent
outbursts of profanity.

867
00:41:28,447 --> 00:41:30,866
And often chronic flatulence.

868
00:41:35,037 --> 00:41:36,788
It's our aim to raise awareness
of the condition...

869
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,248
and, hopefully,
some funds to give...

870
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:40,000
some much-needed support...

871
00:41:40,042 --> 00:41:42,127
to people such
as Mr Ghoshdashtidar here.

872
00:41:42,169 --> 00:41:43,837
Mmm...

873
00:41:46,798 --> 00:41:49,718
- Well, we think
that Mr Goshdashti--
- Ghosh!

874
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,762
- Ghoshtashtidar--
- Ghosh! Ghosh!

875
00:41:51,803 --> 00:41:55,474
Ghoshtashtidar's condition
is very, uh, serious...

876
00:41:55,516 --> 00:41:59,228
and warrants support,
and we'd be delighted...

877
00:41:59,269 --> 00:42:04,066
for Mr Doyle to run
on behalf of acute neuro--

878
00:42:04,107 --> 00:42:05,400
Acute neurocortical emphasitis.

879
00:42:05,442 --> 00:42:07,027
- Or, uh...
- Hapsburg Syn--

880
00:42:07,069 --> 00:42:09,988
Syndrome awareness. Yes.

881
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:12,491
OK.

882
00:42:14,201 --> 00:42:17,412
We'll just need the charity's
registration number.

883
00:42:17,788 --> 00:42:18,830
The what?

884
00:42:18,872 --> 00:42:20,624
The registration number.

885
00:42:27,464 --> 00:42:29,049
Well, that couldn't
have gone any worse.

886
00:42:29,091 --> 00:42:30,843
Mmm.

887
00:42:30,884 --> 00:42:32,135
- Look out!
- Oh!

888
00:42:32,177 --> 00:42:33,512
Ohh!

889
00:42:33,554 --> 00:42:35,556
Aw, hit by a wheelchair.

890
00:42:36,932 --> 00:42:38,058
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

891
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,142
- It stings.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

892
00:42:39,184 --> 00:42:40,227
- It stings.
- No, no, no, no!

893
00:42:40,269 --> 00:42:41,687
Dennis, don't touch him.

894
00:42:41,728 --> 00:42:42,771
- Can you stand?
- Oh, no!

895
00:42:42,813 --> 00:42:45,107
- Are you OK?
- No. My leg's broken.

896
00:42:45,148 --> 00:42:46,316
We are so sorry.

897
00:42:46,358 --> 00:42:48,068
You-- Call an ambulance!

898
00:42:49,486 --> 00:42:50,529
Oh, this can't be happening.

899
00:42:50,571 --> 00:42:52,489
I was supposed to be running
the marathon in three weeks.

900
00:42:52,531 --> 00:42:53,740
- Really?
- Yeah.

901
00:42:53,782 --> 00:42:55,617
There were so many people
dependin' on me.

902
00:42:56,577 --> 00:42:57,786
Charity people?

903
00:42:57,828 --> 00:42:59,454
- Hmm?
- Yeah. God!

904
00:42:59,496 --> 00:43:01,582
What charity people?

905
00:43:01,623 --> 00:43:03,333
What do you think?

906
00:43:03,959 --> 00:43:05,419
Nice.

907
00:43:10,549 --> 00:43:11,592
Nicotine patch?

908
00:43:11,633 --> 00:43:12,676
Applied.

909
00:43:12,718 --> 00:43:15,387
- You been to the toilet?
- One and two.

910
00:43:15,846 --> 00:43:17,389
You ready?

911
00:43:18,473 --> 00:43:19,975
Ready.

912
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:44,291
One.

913
00:43:45,459 --> 00:43:46,502
Ow.

914
00:43:46,543 --> 00:43:47,586
- Two.
- Get up there.

915
00:43:47,628 --> 00:43:49,838
# This is a jailbreak #

916
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,007
# This is a Thursday afternoon #

917
00:43:52,049 --> 00:43:54,343
# But I didn't mean it #

918
00:43:54,384 --> 00:43:56,929
- # I didn't mean it #
- Ow!

919
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:59,097
# I'd never get that far #

920
00:43:59,139 --> 00:44:01,391
# My baby,
short breath wouldn't do #

921
00:44:01,433 --> 00:44:03,519
# But you took it serious #

922
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,479
- # Took it so serious #
- Raise.

923
00:44:05,521 --> 00:44:07,397
- No!
- No!

924
00:44:08,732 --> 00:44:11,360
One, two...

925
00:44:20,369 --> 00:44:22,579
One more! One more!

926
00:44:24,373 --> 00:44:29,127
# Well, you accused me
of wearing movies in my eyes #

927
00:44:29,169 --> 00:44:31,338
# But I still love you #

928
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,715
# Of course, I love you #

929
00:44:33,757 --> 00:44:35,717
# And so I countered #

930
00:44:35,759 --> 00:44:38,345
# You do the same, my Annie I #

931
00:44:38,387 --> 00:44:40,889
# You closed them so fast #

932
00:44:40,931 --> 00:44:46,019
# And you closed them so tight #

933
00:45:24,183 --> 00:45:25,851
- Hi, Dennis.
- Wha--

934
00:45:25,893 --> 00:45:28,687
I saw your friend Gordon
this morning.

935
00:45:28,729 --> 00:45:30,606
I will replace
anything he stole.

936
00:45:30,647 --> 00:45:32,482
He told me
about his little bet.

937
00:45:32,524 --> 00:45:33,609
Oh, yeah.

938
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:35,444
- Yeah. Crazy, huh?
- Yeah.

939
00:45:35,485 --> 00:45:37,446
So I made a crazy little bet
of my own.

940
00:45:37,487 --> 00:45:39,364
Ooh. Who with?

941
00:45:39,406 --> 00:45:40,866
With you, silly.

942
00:45:40,908 --> 00:45:42,993
- We haven't made a bet.
- We're about to.

943
00:45:43,952 --> 00:45:45,412
Here it is.

944
00:45:45,454 --> 00:45:46,496
You finish the race...

945
00:45:46,538 --> 00:45:48,999
I'll forgive
all the back rent you owe.

946
00:45:49,041 --> 00:45:50,918
- And if I don't?
- If you don't finish...

947
00:45:50,959 --> 00:45:52,336
you pack your bags
and you leave.

948
00:45:52,377 --> 00:45:55,422
You go, and I finally get
some tidy tenants...

949
00:45:55,464 --> 00:45:57,132
who pay their rent on time.

950
00:45:57,174 --> 00:45:59,801
- Deal?
- No deal.

951
00:46:01,637 --> 00:46:03,555
Hey, what are you--
Hey, give me that.

952
00:46:03,597 --> 00:46:05,098
- Deal?
- Deal.

953
00:46:08,268 --> 00:46:10,270
- Maya, if you think making--
- Maya?

954
00:46:10,312 --> 00:46:11,772
Hey. Hello, Mr Ghoshdashtidar.

955
00:46:11,813 --> 00:46:13,398
How are you?

956
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,651
I've got something for you.

957
00:46:15,692 --> 00:46:17,736
Ooh. It's not the spatula,
is it?

958
00:46:17,778 --> 00:46:19,571
No.

959
00:46:24,868 --> 00:46:26,453
Wow.

960
00:46:27,704 --> 00:46:30,082
To help you be a good man.

961
00:46:32,251 --> 00:46:33,752
I don't--

962
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:40,092
Thank you.

963
00:46:40,467 --> 00:46:41,969
Wow.

964
00:46:46,849 --> 00:46:49,101
Peter Perfect, a perfect palace.

965
00:46:49,142 --> 00:46:51,311
Try saying that
when you're smashed.

966
00:46:51,353 --> 00:46:54,356
- I will.
- # Lately #

967
00:46:54,398 --> 00:46:59,111
# I been high-steppin' #

968
00:47:01,738 --> 00:47:02,906
# I've got a lover #

969
00:47:02,948 --> 00:47:06,326
- # Who just gets it for real #
- Hey. Hey, Dennis.

970
00:47:06,368 --> 00:47:08,078
- Hey.
- Glad you could make it.

971
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,621
- Thank you.
- Oh, hey.

972
00:47:10,414 --> 00:47:12,332
Wow, Libby.

973
00:47:12,374 --> 00:47:13,834
You look, um...wow.

974
00:47:13,876 --> 00:47:14,918
Thank you.

975
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,587
I know, right?
Never mind all this.

976
00:47:16,628 --> 00:47:18,630
I'll take the view
I have right here.

977
00:47:18,672 --> 00:47:20,299
Oh.

978
00:47:22,676 --> 00:47:24,720
I'm Gordon, Libby's cousin.
Hello.

979
00:47:24,761 --> 00:47:26,638
Gordon. Of course.
I've heard a lot about you.

980
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,140
Very nice to meet you.

981
00:47:28,182 --> 00:47:29,808
- Really?
- Yeah.

982
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:32,060
Oh. I thought you said
he was an asshole.

983
00:47:32,436 --> 00:47:33,645
- Dennis!
- Gordon.

984
00:47:33,687 --> 00:47:35,689
- What?
- It's OK, Lib.

985
00:47:36,356 --> 00:47:37,941
Libby, I got you
a birthday present.

986
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,359
Oh.

987
00:47:39,401 --> 00:47:40,861
It's a CD.

988
00:47:40,903 --> 00:47:42,571
I hope you don't have it,
'cause I don't have a receipt...

989
00:47:42,613 --> 00:47:44,615
and I didn't exactly
get it in a shop.

990
00:47:44,656 --> 00:47:46,825
Well, thank you, I think.

991
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:49,036
It's OK. Where's the toilet?

992
00:47:51,246 --> 00:47:54,666
I'll show you, and, uh,
you can entertain Dennis.

993
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:55,751
OK.

994
00:47:55,792 --> 00:47:58,629
That is if he doesn't mind
hangin' out with an asshole.

995
00:47:59,671 --> 00:48:01,590
He was joking. I never
said you were an asshole.

996
00:48:01,632 --> 00:48:04,092
- Yeah, you did.
- Yeah, I did.

997
00:48:05,802 --> 00:48:06,929
Whit seems nice.

998
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:08,055
Yeah, he is.

999
00:48:08,096 --> 00:48:10,724
Good-looking, friendly,
well-off, steady job...

1000
00:48:10,766 --> 00:48:11,808
good with Jake...

1001
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:13,519
just like you got him
out of a catalogue.

1002
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:14,728
And what's your point?

1003
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:17,272
I ordered a pair of shoes
once from a catalogue.

1004
00:48:17,314 --> 00:48:19,441
Gorgeous soft leather
ltalian loafers.

1005
00:48:19,483 --> 00:48:20,734
They looked amazing,
but then they arrived...

1006
00:48:20,776 --> 00:48:22,945
and I put them on,
and they hurt like fuck.

1007
00:48:22,986 --> 00:48:24,696
Thanks. I'll bear that in mind.

1008
00:48:25,072 --> 00:48:26,698
Wow.

1009
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:29,076
Hey, do you think it would
be weird if I took a bath?

1010
00:48:31,954 --> 00:48:34,122
Yeah, that would be weird.

1011
00:48:34,706 --> 00:48:36,458
- Hey.
- Hey.

1012
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,043
- Here you go.
- Oh, thanks.

1013
00:48:38,085 --> 00:48:39,419
Cheers.

1014
00:48:39,461 --> 00:48:40,963
Cheers.

1015
00:48:42,881 --> 00:48:44,341
What do you think?

1016
00:48:44,383 --> 00:48:46,510
I think I see a guy
peeing on your car.

1017
00:48:46,552 --> 00:48:48,053
- What?
- Got you.

1018
00:48:48,762 --> 00:48:50,889
Oh, very good.

1019
00:48:50,931 --> 00:48:52,975
Actually, you see that?

1020
00:48:53,016 --> 00:48:54,059
What?

1021
00:48:54,101 --> 00:48:55,853
There. I'm talking
about St. Paul's Cathedral.

1022
00:48:55,894 --> 00:48:57,312
- You see it?
- Uh-huh.

1023
00:48:57,354 --> 00:48:58,981
Currently my favourite spot
in London.

1024
00:48:59,022 --> 00:49:00,274
You know why?

1025
00:49:00,315 --> 00:49:02,484
Uh, is it because that's
where you first realized...

1026
00:49:02,526 --> 00:49:04,111
how amazing you are?

1027
00:49:05,696 --> 00:49:07,531
It's the finish line
for the marathon.

1028
00:49:08,115 --> 00:49:09,366
Only two more days,
and I get to cross it.

1029
00:49:09,408 --> 00:49:10,492
Can't wait.

1030
00:49:10,534 --> 00:49:12,077
Me, too.

1031
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:14,288
Greatest feeling in the world,
finishing a distance race.

1032
00:49:14,329 --> 00:49:16,665
I think you're really
gonna get a kick out of it.

1033
00:49:16,707 --> 00:49:17,958
You don't think
I'm gonna finish, do you?

1034
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,084
No, I don't.

1035
00:49:19,126 --> 00:49:20,169
Why not?

1036
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:22,045
'Cause it's really hard, Dennis.

1037
00:49:22,087 --> 00:49:23,463
Actually requires
a couple of things...

1038
00:49:23,505 --> 00:49:26,466
that, uh, forgive me,
but you don't seem to possess.

1039
00:49:26,508 --> 00:49:27,885
I happen to have
a very nice pair...

1040
00:49:27,926 --> 00:49:29,928
of running shoes now,
thank you very much.

1041
00:49:31,054 --> 00:49:33,932
I'm talking about discipline
and perseverance.

1042
00:49:33,974 --> 00:49:36,560
And all cute
little comments aside...

1043
00:49:36,894 --> 00:49:38,270
there comes a point
in every race--

1044
00:49:38,312 --> 00:49:40,147
it could be the fifth mile,
it could be the 25th--

1045
00:49:40,189 --> 00:49:41,732
but, eventually,
you're gonna hit...

1046
00:49:41,773 --> 00:49:43,692
what runners like to call
"the wall."

1047
00:49:43,734 --> 00:49:45,152
And when you do...

1048
00:49:45,194 --> 00:49:47,905
you won't be able to breathe
or think or even move.

1049
00:49:47,946 --> 00:49:50,157
All you're gonna wanna do
is give up.

1050
00:49:50,199 --> 00:49:51,700
And I have
a very strong feeling...

1051
00:49:51,742 --> 00:49:54,369
that that's exactly
what you're gonna do, Dennis.

1052
00:49:54,661 --> 00:49:55,704
See, that's the difference...

1053
00:49:55,746 --> 00:49:58,165
between getting a girl
like Libby...

1054
00:49:58,207 --> 00:50:00,083
and keeping a girl like Libby.

1055
00:50:05,422 --> 00:50:06,632
You good?
You need anything else?

1056
00:50:06,673 --> 00:50:09,176
- No, I'm good.
- OK.

1057
00:50:16,016 --> 00:50:20,687
# Love is sweet, they say #

1058
00:50:22,189 --> 00:50:27,611
# Promises of tomorrow #

1059
00:50:28,362 --> 00:50:35,369
# But the tighter you grip,
the faster you slip #

1060
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:39,581
# This much I know #

1061
00:50:40,624 --> 00:50:43,752
# Lately, I want everyhing #

1062
00:50:43,794 --> 00:50:46,630
# Every star tied to a string #

1063
00:50:46,672 --> 00:50:49,675
# Coffee, tea, and in between #

1064
00:50:49,716 --> 00:50:52,719
# The sweetest smile
I've ever seen #

1065
00:50:52,761 --> 00:50:56,390
# A different song
in every room... #

1066
00:50:56,431 --> 00:50:58,642
- Oh, shit! Sorry. Sorry.
- That's OK.

1067
00:50:58,684 --> 00:51:00,602
- No, it's OK. It's OK.
- Oh, man. It's just--

1068
00:51:00,644 --> 00:51:02,229
It's just soda water, honestly.

1069
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,939
Should I not rub
your boob, then?

1070
00:51:04,606 --> 00:51:06,149
- Yeah.
- OK. Sorry.

1071
00:51:06,191 --> 00:51:07,317
I can do the other one,
you know?

1072
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:09,444
'Cause I'm here, I might as well
just even it out.

1073
00:51:09,486 --> 00:51:10,988
Sorry.

1074
00:51:13,365 --> 00:51:15,284
So, you havin' a...
havin' a good time?

1075
00:51:15,742 --> 00:51:18,620
Yeah. Yes, I am, thank you.

1076
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:23,000
You've lost weight.

1077
00:51:23,041 --> 00:51:24,376
Yeah, just a little bit.

1078
00:51:24,418 --> 00:51:25,460
Yeah.

1079
00:51:25,502 --> 00:51:27,045
You know, get on.

1080
00:51:27,087 --> 00:51:30,174
Where's Jake?
I thought he was gonna be here.

1081
00:51:30,215 --> 00:51:31,550
Uh, no.

1082
00:51:31,592 --> 00:51:33,177
Whit thought that we'd have
a better time...

1083
00:51:33,218 --> 00:51:35,220
if we got a sitter.

1084
00:51:35,262 --> 00:51:38,015
Oh. What did you think?

1085
00:51:42,102 --> 00:51:43,687
I should get back.

1086
00:51:43,729 --> 00:51:47,024
Libby, um,
I never actually thanked you.

1087
00:51:48,358 --> 00:51:49,401
For what?

1088
00:51:49,443 --> 00:51:53,030
Well, for just sort of
lettin' me back into your life.

1089
00:51:53,071 --> 00:51:54,781
Jake's life.

1090
00:51:54,823 --> 00:51:56,617
Yeah, well, you know.

1091
00:51:57,701 --> 00:51:58,869
I mean, l-I wouldn't have
been surprised...

1092
00:51:58,911 --> 00:52:00,829
if you just cut me off
completely, you know?

1093
00:52:00,871 --> 00:52:02,664
Ugh, now you tell me.

1094
00:52:03,707 --> 00:52:05,167
Well, no, I mean--

1095
00:52:05,209 --> 00:52:06,877
No, he needs his dad.

1096
00:52:07,836 --> 00:52:09,296
Yeah.

1097
00:52:10,881 --> 00:52:14,843
You were right, you know,
about me enterin' the marathon.

1098
00:52:14,885 --> 00:52:17,054
It-- You know,
it was because I was...

1099
00:52:17,095 --> 00:52:19,056
sort of trying to win you back
kind of thing.

1100
00:52:19,097 --> 00:52:21,600
And I'd always kinda hoped
that maybe, we'd, you know...

1101
00:52:21,642 --> 00:52:22,851
get back together and that...

1102
00:52:22,893 --> 00:52:26,021
but, you know,
when I saw you with Whit--

1103
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,898
- Dennis.
- I know-- I know-- I know--

1104
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:31,109
I know it's the height
of hypocrisy, and I know--

1105
00:52:31,151 --> 00:52:32,611
I know doin' this
isn't gonna change anything...

1106
00:52:32,653 --> 00:52:35,447
or--or make anything better,
but, um...

1107
00:52:37,616 --> 00:52:40,035
I'd just--
I'd settle for your respect.

1108
00:52:42,162 --> 00:52:43,413
You know,
I'd settle for you smiling...

1109
00:52:43,455 --> 00:52:45,958
when you thought about the time
that we had together...

1110
00:52:45,999 --> 00:52:48,544
and not thinkin'
it was a waste of time.

1111
00:52:50,379 --> 00:52:51,505
You know, I mean, I know...

1112
00:52:51,547 --> 00:52:54,800
I didn't do you any favours
on that day, OK?

1113
00:52:54,842 --> 00:52:57,719
I did a stupid, stupid thing.

1114
00:52:57,761 --> 00:53:00,806
But it was
only because I thought...

1115
00:53:00,848 --> 00:53:03,976
spoiling your day was better
than ruining your life.

1116
00:53:05,644 --> 00:53:07,855
Does that make any sense?

1117
00:53:11,275 --> 00:53:13,026
You're such an idiot.

1118
00:53:18,115 --> 00:53:19,449
Hey, I got you something.

1119
00:53:19,491 --> 00:53:21,201
Oh, what is it?

1120
00:53:21,243 --> 00:53:23,412
It's something
I think you don't have.

1121
00:53:23,453 --> 00:53:25,581
A history
of reliable boyfriends?

1122
00:53:26,832 --> 00:53:29,168
No, it's--
Well, it's only, you know...

1123
00:53:29,209 --> 00:53:30,335
- Open it later on.
- OK.

1124
00:53:30,377 --> 00:53:32,045
Happy birthday.

1125
00:53:32,087 --> 00:53:33,922
- Thank you.
- No.

1126
00:53:37,009 --> 00:53:38,510
Oh.

1127
00:53:57,237 --> 00:53:59,489
- Everyone, could I have
your attention?
- Oh, my God.

1128
00:53:59,531 --> 00:54:03,452
Hey. Everyone,
your attention, please.

1129
00:54:03,493 --> 00:54:05,746
Everyone, hi.

1130
00:54:05,787 --> 00:54:06,830
Thank you for coming.

1131
00:54:06,872 --> 00:54:08,790
- Really good to see you all.
- Thank you.

1132
00:54:09,875 --> 00:54:10,959
As you all know,
we're here to celebrate...

1133
00:54:11,001 --> 00:54:15,130
the birthday
of one Elizabeth Olivia O'Dell.

1134
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:19,134
Happy birthday.

1135
00:54:19,176 --> 00:54:23,096
As many of you know, uh,
my passion in life is running.

1136
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,098
In fact,
in a couple of days...

1137
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:28,018
I'll be completing another
marathon, thank you very much.

1138
00:54:30,729 --> 00:54:33,941
Uh, now, success in running
requires a lot...

1139
00:54:33,982 --> 00:54:36,652
of the same things
as success in love--

1140
00:54:36,693 --> 00:54:39,238
passion, determination...

1141
00:54:39,279 --> 00:54:42,449
and something I've needed
a lot of with Libby, stamina.

1142
00:54:45,661 --> 00:54:47,287
That's just inappropriate,
isn't it?

1143
00:54:47,329 --> 00:54:48,705
The long-winded point
I'm trying to make...

1144
00:54:48,747 --> 00:54:52,459
is that both love and running
require heart...

1145
00:54:52,501 --> 00:54:54,711
and Libby has...
truly, has more heart...

1146
00:54:54,753 --> 00:54:56,713
than any other person
I've ever known.

1147
00:54:56,755 --> 00:54:59,800
So happy birthday, sweetie.

1148
00:55:01,343 --> 00:55:03,095
Thank you all.

1149
00:55:07,724 --> 00:55:09,977
Oh, trainers!

1150
00:55:10,394 --> 00:55:13,146
I'm sorry. Can l, uh,
just see this for a second?

1151
00:55:13,188 --> 00:55:15,899
Now, what, um...
As most of you know...

1152
00:55:15,941 --> 00:55:19,444
I usually run my races alone,
but I thought...

1153
00:55:20,696 --> 00:55:23,198
I was wondering
if you would consider...

1154
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,950
becoming my partner?

1155
00:55:30,873 --> 00:55:32,374
Oh, my.

1156
00:55:33,417 --> 00:55:36,712
Libby, will you marry me?

1157
00:55:49,349 --> 00:55:51,435
No, no, no, no.

1158
00:55:52,394 --> 00:55:53,770
OK. Yes.

1159
00:55:53,812 --> 00:55:55,772
- Yes?
- Yeah.

1160
00:56:10,746 --> 00:56:12,414
So beautiful.

1161
00:56:13,081 --> 00:56:14,917
Just beautiful.

1162
00:56:15,292 --> 00:56:16,793
Thank you.

1163
00:56:17,794 --> 00:56:19,379
Thank you, everybody.

1164
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:23,091
Crazy.

1165
00:56:23,717 --> 00:56:25,219
What'd I miss?

1166
00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:29,890
So...

1167
00:56:31,433 --> 00:56:34,269
You bloody...poison.

1168
00:56:35,354 --> 00:56:38,774
All right. You can stick it
up your ass...

1169
00:56:38,815 --> 00:56:41,944
you big American prick.

1170
00:56:42,611 --> 00:56:45,239
# Our love has changed #

1171
00:56:47,866 --> 00:56:51,036
- I don't mind they've decided.
- # It's not the same #

1172
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:56,458
# And the only way to say it #

1173
00:56:58,043 --> 00:57:00,254
# Is say it #

1174
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,382
# It's better #

1175
00:57:06,301 --> 00:57:08,595
# I can't concede #

1176
00:57:12,307 --> 00:57:15,269
# This way I feel #

1177
00:57:17,312 --> 00:57:20,399
# For all the time
we spend together #

1178
00:57:22,234 --> 00:57:27,239
# Forever just gets better #

1179
00:57:29,575 --> 00:57:33,120
# See, what I'm trying
to say is #

1180
00:57:34,288 --> 00:57:39,251
# You make things better #

1181
00:57:41,378 --> 00:57:45,632
# And no matter
what the day is #

1182
00:57:46,341 --> 00:57:51,513
# With you here, it's better #

1183
00:57:54,683 --> 00:57:57,227
# I'll stand by you #

1184
00:58:00,814 --> 00:58:03,942
# If you stand by me #

1185
00:58:05,611 --> 00:58:09,573
# I think it's time
that I reveal it #

1186
00:58:10,324 --> 00:58:12,868
# 'Cause I believe it #

1187
00:58:13,785 --> 00:58:16,413
# It's better #

1188
00:58:18,207 --> 00:58:22,044
# See, what I'm tryin'
to say is #

1189
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:28,175
# You make things better #

1190
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,270
Dennis!

1191
00:58:42,439 --> 00:58:44,691
So what do you think
we should do, Dennis?

1192
00:58:45,651 --> 00:58:48,779
Jake got really upset when
I tried to explain it to him.

1193
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:53,659
So, I just wonder whether maybe
you could talk to him today?

1194
00:58:58,372 --> 00:58:59,706
You know, just--
If he heard it from you...

1195
00:58:59,748 --> 00:59:02,459
that you're always gonna be
his daddy, you know?

1196
00:59:02,501 --> 00:59:04,711
I take it the diet's off.

1197
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,799
Dennis, are you even listening?

1198
00:59:08,841 --> 00:59:09,925
Dennis!

1199
00:59:09,967 --> 00:59:11,593
What? You want--
You want me to tell Jake...

1200
00:59:11,635 --> 00:59:13,929
what a--what a--
what a perfect guy Whit is...

1201
00:59:13,971 --> 00:59:15,389
and it's all gonna be
really perfect...

1202
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:16,974
in his new perfect life?

1203
00:59:17,015 --> 00:59:19,476
No.
Not necessarily in those words.

1204
00:59:19,518 --> 00:59:22,020
I cannot believe
you're gonna marry this guy.

1205
00:59:22,062 --> 00:59:24,273
He pulled your engagement ring
out of a shoe.

1206
00:59:24,314 --> 00:59:26,233
Please, Dennis,
you're the only one...

1207
00:59:26,275 --> 00:59:28,443
who can help Jake
feel OK about this.

1208
00:59:28,485 --> 00:59:30,737
Listen, if you wanna marry Whit,
that's fine, OK?

1209
00:59:30,779 --> 00:59:32,823
You're a big girl, and you can
make your own mistakes, OK?

1210
00:59:32,865 --> 00:59:34,449
But don't come down here
while I'm eating...

1211
00:59:34,491 --> 00:59:36,577
my full English breakfast
with extra breakfast...

1212
00:59:36,618 --> 00:59:38,412
and expect me to make things
easier for you, OK?

1213
00:59:38,453 --> 00:59:40,706
Can I please get
some ketchup here?!

1214
00:59:42,416 --> 00:59:43,834
I'm not gonna run.

1215
00:59:43,876 --> 00:59:44,918
What?!

1216
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,837
I said I'm not running.

1217
00:59:51,675 --> 00:59:53,177
What do you mean,
you're not running?

1218
00:59:53,218 --> 00:59:55,804
I mean, I'm not running. I'm
not running a stupid marathon.

1219
00:59:56,221 --> 00:59:57,764
Why? Because Libby's
getting married again?

1220
00:59:57,806 --> 00:59:58,849
What did you think?

1221
00:59:58,891 --> 01:00:00,392
She-- She's not gonna find
anybody better than you?

1222
01:00:00,434 --> 01:00:01,560
Well, let me be the first
to tell you.

1223
01:00:01,602 --> 01:00:03,270
You know, you're
not a tough act to follow.

1224
01:00:03,312 --> 01:00:04,855
Oh, what?
You think I don't know that?

1225
01:00:04,897 --> 01:00:07,399
I don't care any more!

1226
01:00:07,691 --> 01:00:09,401
- What about me?
- What about you?

1227
01:00:09,443 --> 01:00:11,236
I've got money on this!
A lot of money!

1228
01:00:11,278 --> 01:00:13,322
That is not my problem!

1229
01:00:14,114 --> 01:00:15,240
Quit it!

1230
01:00:15,282 --> 01:00:16,909
I'm not the quitter.

1231
01:00:23,207 --> 01:00:24,833
- Let me go!
- Ow, my ear!

1232
01:00:24,875 --> 01:00:26,627
- Let go!
- Ow!

1233
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:38,055
Oh, OK! Oh, all right!

1234
01:00:38,096 --> 01:00:42,059
Oh, enough!
Just-- Just stop for a minute!

1235
01:00:51,735 --> 01:00:54,029
# Every day,
I love you less and less #

1236
01:00:54,905 --> 01:00:57,491
# I've got to get this feeling
off my chest #

1237
01:00:57,533 --> 01:01:00,327
# The doctor says
all I need's pills and rest #

1238
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:02,496
# Since every day,
I love you less and less #

1239
01:01:02,538 --> 01:01:04,289
# Unless, unless #

1240
01:01:04,331 --> 01:01:05,582
- # I know, I feel it #
- Are you gonna run?

1241
01:01:05,624 --> 01:01:06,667
# In my bones #
- No!

1242
01:01:06,708 --> 01:01:08,001
# I'm sick, I'm tired #

1243
01:01:08,043 --> 01:01:09,294
# Of staying in control #

1244
01:01:09,336 --> 01:01:12,673
- # Oh, yes, I feel
I race upon a wheel #
- Oh, God!

1245
01:01:12,714 --> 01:01:15,384
- OK, OK, OK, OK.
- You'll run?

1246
01:01:15,425 --> 01:01:17,052
# Oh, yes, I'm stressed #

1247
01:01:17,094 --> 01:01:18,554
# I'm sorry I digressed #

1248
01:01:18,595 --> 01:01:21,348
# lmpressed,
you're dressed to SOS #

1249
01:01:21,390 --> 01:01:23,392
# Oh-oh #

1250
01:01:23,433 --> 01:01:26,103
- My balls!
- # And my parents love me #

1251
01:01:26,144 --> 01:01:29,356
# Oh-oh #

1252
01:01:29,398 --> 01:01:32,234
- # And my girlfriend loves me #
- That's it! Run away!

1253
01:01:32,276 --> 01:01:34,278
That's what you always do!

1254
01:01:34,903 --> 01:01:36,738
Run away!

1255
01:01:38,156 --> 01:01:40,450
# Every day,
I love you less and less #

1256
01:01:44,371 --> 01:01:46,373
Hey, what the--

1257
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:48,542
- Hello, Dennis.
- What are you doing?

1258
01:01:48,584 --> 01:01:49,626
Gordon called.

1259
01:01:49,668 --> 01:01:51,753
He tells me
you're not running the marathon.

1260
01:01:51,795 --> 01:01:53,297
- Yeah, but--
- But, what?

1261
01:01:53,338 --> 01:01:54,715
Are you running or not?

1262
01:01:54,756 --> 01:01:55,799
- No, but--
- So there you go.

1263
01:01:55,841 --> 01:01:57,092
- Wait--
- Sorry, Dennis.

1264
01:01:57,134 --> 01:01:59,178
A bet's a bet. You're out.

1265
01:01:59,469 --> 01:02:01,972
Mr Ghoshdashtidar?
Mr Ghoshdashtidar!

1266
01:02:02,014 --> 01:02:03,473
- Who the hell are you?
- Oh, please, look.

1267
01:02:03,515 --> 01:02:06,018
- I thought you were
a good man, Dennis.
- Yeah...

1268
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:09,438
A little screwed up here
in the head, OK.

1269
01:02:09,479 --> 01:02:11,565
But Maya was right about you.
You are no good.

1270
01:02:11,607 --> 01:02:13,108
- Look--
- Always running away...

1271
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:14,693
never running
in the right direction.

1272
01:02:14,735 --> 01:02:15,777
Yeah, but, oh--

1273
01:02:15,819 --> 01:02:18,488
I bought you
new running shoes, Dennis.

1274
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:21,116
The man said
they were the best you can buy.

1275
01:02:21,158 --> 01:02:23,035
- Yes, but--
- "But, but, but!"

1276
01:02:23,076 --> 01:02:26,246
Always "but"!
Always excuses with you!

1277
01:02:26,288 --> 01:02:29,124
Always some reason
why it's not your fault!

1278
01:02:29,166 --> 01:02:33,170
I have news for you,
Dennis Doyle from downstairs.

1279
01:02:33,462 --> 01:02:35,881
It's all your fault!

1280
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:51,480
- Hi.
- Hi.

1281
01:02:52,606 --> 01:02:54,775
You-- You havin' a yard sale?

1282
01:02:55,192 --> 01:02:57,402
No. Where's Libby?

1283
01:02:57,444 --> 01:02:58,946
Uh, she's pickin' up Jake.

1284
01:02:58,987 --> 01:03:02,616
I suppose, uh,
congratulations are in order.

1285
01:03:02,658 --> 01:03:05,827
Oh, yeah. Well, thank you.

1286
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:08,622
Best man won.

1287
01:03:09,289 --> 01:03:12,626
Well, I wasn't really aware
it was a contest.

1288
01:03:14,127 --> 01:03:16,547
Dennis! Dennis!
Is Jake with you?

1289
01:03:16,588 --> 01:03:17,673
No, why? I--

1290
01:03:17,714 --> 01:03:19,007
Well, is he here, Whit?

1291
01:03:19,049 --> 01:03:20,300
- I thought you were
picking him up.
- Jake!

1292
01:03:20,342 --> 01:03:21,385
- Libby?
- Jake!

1293
01:03:21,426 --> 01:03:22,594
Libby, what is--

1294
01:03:22,636 --> 01:03:24,096
- What did you say to him?!
- l-- What are you--

1295
01:03:24,137 --> 01:03:25,389
I didn't say anything.
What do you mean?

1296
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:26,682
Well, he was at Emily's
and something happened.

1297
01:03:26,723 --> 01:03:27,891
He just ran out.

1298
01:03:27,933 --> 01:03:30,185
- What?
- He has run away, OK?

1299
01:03:30,227 --> 01:03:32,062
Jake ran away!

1300
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:37,901
Jake!

1301
01:03:39,027 --> 01:03:40,571
Jake!

1302
01:03:42,573 --> 01:03:44,074
Gordon!

1303
01:03:44,324 --> 01:03:45,784
Gordon!

1304
01:03:46,702 --> 01:03:48,370
- Yes?
- Jake's run away.

1305
01:03:48,412 --> 01:03:50,414
- What?
- He's run away!

1306
01:03:50,455 --> 01:03:51,456
All right.
Well, wait a minute.

1307
01:03:51,498 --> 01:03:53,417
Just calm down.
Think for a second.

1308
01:03:53,458 --> 01:03:55,043
Where would he go?

1309
01:04:36,668 --> 01:04:38,670
Hiya, snot-face.

1310
01:04:57,898 --> 01:04:59,566
Yeah, he's fine.

1311
01:05:00,192 --> 01:05:02,569
We'll be back in about
a half an hour, I guess.

1312
01:05:02,611 --> 01:05:04,238
OK.

1313
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:07,574
Is she mad at me?

1314
01:05:07,616 --> 01:05:09,826
No, no.
She's just glad you're OK.

1315
01:05:13,372 --> 01:05:15,040
Do you wanna tell me
what happened?

1316
01:05:15,082 --> 01:05:18,043
Emily doesn't wanna be
my girlfriend any more.

1317
01:05:18,085 --> 01:05:19,294
Why not?

1318
01:05:19,336 --> 01:05:21,630
'Cause there's this other boy,
Robert...

1319
01:05:21,672 --> 01:05:23,340
and he's got a ponytail...

1320
01:05:23,382 --> 01:05:25,509
and she likes him now.

1321
01:05:25,551 --> 01:05:27,511
What, she likes him
because he's got a ponytail?

1322
01:05:27,553 --> 01:05:29,596
Uh-huh.

1323
01:05:31,306 --> 01:05:32,683
Jake 'n Bake...

1324
01:05:32,724 --> 01:05:34,101
as you get older,
you're gonna realize...

1325
01:05:34,142 --> 01:05:36,436
there are a lot of things
that you don't like, OK?

1326
01:05:36,478 --> 01:05:38,856
Things much worse than this.

1327
01:05:38,897 --> 01:05:41,275
And when those things happen,
you can't just run away.

1328
01:05:41,316 --> 01:05:43,277
Why not?

1329
01:05:43,318 --> 01:05:45,654
Because it doesn't solve
the problem.

1330
01:05:45,696 --> 01:05:46,780
You know,
when you start running...

1331
01:05:46,822 --> 01:05:47,865
the problem's still there.

1332
01:05:47,906 --> 01:05:50,576
You've got to stick at it,
and then figure out a way...

1333
01:05:50,617 --> 01:05:53,704
to solve the problem, even if
it's really, really hard.

1334
01:05:53,745 --> 01:05:56,123
Is that what you do, Dad?

1335
01:05:59,459 --> 01:06:01,128
Dad?

1336
01:06:03,422 --> 01:06:04,923
Dennis!

1337
01:06:05,632 --> 01:06:06,925
Dennis!

1338
01:06:06,967 --> 01:06:08,468
Gordon!

1339
01:06:10,929 --> 01:06:12,389
Gordon!

1340
01:06:14,141 --> 01:06:15,893
- Found him?
- Yes.

1341
01:06:15,934 --> 01:06:18,145
Good. You can't stay here.

1342
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:19,563
Gordon!

1343
01:06:19,605 --> 01:06:20,647
What?!

1344
01:06:20,689 --> 01:06:22,941
I'm running.

1345
01:06:24,067 --> 01:06:25,819
Well, come on up then.

1346
01:06:27,654 --> 01:06:29,823
Wow, these are great.
Where'd you get 'em?

1347
01:06:29,865 --> 01:06:31,366
- Whit's place.
- Thanks.

1348
01:06:31,408 --> 01:06:32,576
See, the trick is...

1349
01:06:32,618 --> 01:06:35,037
you got to load up on carbs
the night before the race.

1350
01:06:35,078 --> 01:06:36,121
I read it in Cosmo.

1351
01:06:36,163 --> 01:06:37,289
How are the legs? Not too tight?

1352
01:06:37,331 --> 01:06:38,832
No. No, they're fine.

1353
01:06:38,874 --> 01:06:40,083
Have you got everyhing
you need?

1354
01:06:40,125 --> 01:06:42,586
You know, your shoes,
your shorts, penis t-shirt?

1355
01:06:42,628 --> 01:06:44,880
- Yes.
- Oh.

1356
01:06:52,387 --> 01:06:53,889
I'm not really in the mood.

1357
01:06:53,931 --> 01:06:55,557
- It's for your nipples.
- What?

1358
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:58,101
You run a 26-mile race,
a lot of friction...

1359
01:06:58,143 --> 01:06:59,561
is generated from your shirt
to your nipples.

1360
01:06:59,603 --> 01:07:00,938
And the last thing you want
during a marathon...

1361
01:07:00,979 --> 01:07:02,022
is nipple chafing.

1362
01:07:02,064 --> 01:07:03,357
- Cosmo?
- Yeah.

1363
01:07:03,398 --> 01:07:04,733
I'm not puttin' that
on my nipples, OK?

1364
01:07:04,775 --> 01:07:06,777
And I'm not gonna eat this.
Let's just go to sleep.

1365
01:07:06,818 --> 01:07:08,820
Well, at least,
let me make your bed for you.

1366
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:12,783
Anything else?

1367
01:07:12,824 --> 01:07:14,034
Have you got a pillow?

1368
01:07:14,076 --> 01:07:16,703
- No.
- Well, then I guess I'm fine.

1369
01:07:20,958 --> 01:07:23,001
Hey, what time
do you have to be up tomorrow?

1370
01:07:23,043 --> 01:07:26,213
Well, we should set the alarm
for about seven o'clock.

1371
01:07:26,255 --> 01:07:27,923
- I don't have an alarm clock.
- Why not?

1372
01:07:27,965 --> 01:07:30,300
I never need to be anywhere.

1373
01:07:34,471 --> 01:07:35,848
The race starts at 9.00, OK?

1374
01:07:35,889 --> 01:07:39,017
So we should leave here
no later than 8.00, OK?

1375
01:07:39,059 --> 01:07:40,727
OK.

1376
01:07:42,563 --> 01:07:43,730
Night.

1377
01:07:43,772 --> 01:07:45,274
Love you.

1378
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:52,823
A very good morning to you.

1379
01:07:52,865 --> 01:07:54,783
It's a beautiful day
here in London...

1380
01:07:54,825 --> 01:07:56,869
for the first
annual Nike River Run.

1381
01:07:56,910 --> 01:07:59,246
We've had a very warm welcome
from the crowd...

1382
01:07:59,288 --> 01:08:01,039
and we've got perfect conditions
for this race, Denise.

1383
01:08:01,081 --> 01:08:02,583
We certainly have.

1384
01:08:02,624 --> 01:08:04,960
26.2 miles
along the River Thames...

1385
01:08:05,002 --> 01:08:07,129
10,000 runners
from all over the globe...

1386
01:08:07,171 --> 01:08:09,131
and an amazing way
for many of these folks...

1387
01:08:09,173 --> 01:08:11,842
to raise money for so many
worthwhile charities.

1388
01:08:11,884 --> 01:08:13,218
And as we can see,
race officials...

1389
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:15,262
are already busy
at the starting line...

1390
01:08:15,304 --> 01:08:18,307
with the start
less than an hour away.

1391
01:08:24,188 --> 01:08:26,023
- Taxi!
- # Keep on runnin' #

1392
01:08:26,064 --> 01:08:27,482
Taxi!

1393
01:08:27,524 --> 01:08:30,444
- # Keep on hidin' #
- Taxi!

1394
01:08:30,485 --> 01:08:31,528
Wait!

1395
01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:32,613
- Wait!
- # One fine day #

1396
01:08:32,654 --> 01:08:33,947
# I'm gonna be the one #

1397
01:08:33,989 --> 01:08:35,782
# To make you understand #

1398
01:08:35,824 --> 01:08:37,159
- It's a wonderful course.
- # Oh, yeah #

1399
01:08:37,201 --> 01:08:39,995
- They'll wind
around the Thames...
- # I'm gonna be your man #

1400
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:43,248
They'll cross over five bridges,
including Osney Bridge...

1401
01:08:43,290 --> 01:08:44,791
Albert Bridge,
and the Millennium Bridge.

1402
01:08:44,833 --> 01:08:46,752
OK, OK. So go at your
own pace today, all right?

1403
01:08:46,793 --> 01:08:49,171
- Slow and steady.
- OK. Slow and steady.

1404
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:52,174
Yeah, they're challenging
the leaders we have here.

1405
01:08:52,216 --> 01:08:54,843
One from Japan,
Hiyusha Shinuzu...

1406
01:08:54,885 --> 01:08:57,888
and, of course, up there also,
is Sumi Yamata.

1407
01:08:58,972 --> 01:09:00,432
Watch it!

1408
01:09:00,891 --> 01:09:03,018
- ldiot!
- # Keep on runnin' #

1409
01:09:04,436 --> 01:09:05,479
- # Runnin' from #
- The other way! Go back!

1410
01:09:05,521 --> 01:09:07,064
- # My heart #
- No, we're not goin' back!

1411
01:09:07,105 --> 01:09:09,024
Amongst the names
we should keep an eye on...

1412
01:09:09,066 --> 01:09:10,192
are the men from Kenya.

1413
01:09:10,234 --> 01:09:13,779
Always so strong, Wilson Deetay
and Collington Degwa...

1414
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:17,115
they always can be found
at front of the pack.

1415
01:09:20,744 --> 01:09:21,787
This is as far
as I can get, mate.

1416
01:09:21,828 --> 01:09:23,330
But I need to get to the start
of the race.

1417
01:09:23,372 --> 01:09:25,916
Well, it's just over the bridge.
That's fifteen quid, mate.

1418
01:09:25,958 --> 01:09:27,125
Have you got any money?

1419
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:29,002
Sir, we have
a slight liquidity problem.

1420
01:09:29,044 --> 01:09:31,380
That is a shame.

1421
01:09:33,298 --> 01:09:34,341
Uh, no. Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

1422
01:09:34,383 --> 01:09:36,468
Look, look. This is a 19...

1423
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:39,972
...40 Rolex 520 Perpetual
Oyster with a bubble back.

1424
01:09:40,013 --> 01:09:41,056
That's not too shabby.

1425
01:09:41,098 --> 01:09:42,140
Gordon,
you can't possibly give him--

1426
01:09:42,182 --> 01:09:43,767
Hey, it's an investment.

1427
01:09:44,685 --> 01:09:46,019
Gordon, thank you.

1428
01:09:46,061 --> 01:09:47,646
I'll see you later then.

1429
01:09:49,606 --> 01:09:51,066
# Keep on runnin' #

1430
01:09:51,108 --> 01:09:52,442
Hey, good luck!

1431
01:09:52,484 --> 01:09:54,361
Now, typically,
the day would have started...

1432
01:09:54,403 --> 01:09:56,613
at the crack of dawn
for most of these runners.

1433
01:09:56,655 --> 01:09:58,031
They had a balanced breakfast...

1434
01:09:58,073 --> 01:10:01,493
precise physical
and mental preparation.

1435
01:10:01,535 --> 01:10:04,788
On a day like today,
to leave anything to chance...

1436
01:10:04,830 --> 01:10:06,874
you'd either have
to be extremely naive...

1437
01:10:06,915 --> 01:10:08,333
or a complete idiot.

1438
01:10:08,375 --> 01:10:11,211
# Everyone is talkin' about me #

1439
01:10:16,383 --> 01:10:18,260
Over here. To me, to me.

1440
01:10:19,428 --> 01:10:20,470
That's it. Be careful.

1441
01:10:20,512 --> 01:10:22,055
That's an antique.

1442
01:10:22,472 --> 01:10:24,558
- Did it start? Did it start?
- Not yet.

1443
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:25,851
- Turn it on.
- Here we go.

1444
01:10:25,893 --> 01:10:27,269
What do we love
about these days...

1445
01:10:27,311 --> 01:10:29,605
is the sheer
mix of competitors.

1446
01:10:29,646 --> 01:10:31,356
They come
in all shapes and sizes...

1447
01:10:31,398 --> 01:10:35,777
from the elite over there
to the--how should we put it--

1448
01:10:35,819 --> 01:10:37,779
not so elite.

1449
01:10:38,488 --> 01:10:40,240
That's Dennis!

1450
01:10:42,034 --> 01:10:44,119
Look at that stretch.
Look at that.

1451
01:10:45,287 --> 01:10:46,538
Double or nothing?

1452
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:47,623
Yeah, right.

1453
01:10:47,664 --> 01:10:51,376
Just a few minutes to go now.
The warm-ups should be complete.

1454
01:10:51,418 --> 01:10:55,214
It's time, if you have one,
for that pre-race ritual.

1455
01:10:56,715 --> 01:10:59,092
Well, well, well.
You made it, huh?

1456
01:10:59,134 --> 01:11:00,135
Yeah.

1457
01:11:00,177 --> 01:11:01,803
Just wanna wish you luck
out there.

1458
01:11:01,845 --> 01:11:04,932
You, too. How are your nipples?

1459
01:11:06,016 --> 01:11:07,559
Great.

1460
01:11:17,444 --> 01:11:18,445
- More toast.
- Only a few moments...

1461
01:11:18,487 --> 01:11:19,780
to go now,
and the officials are--

1462
01:11:19,821 --> 01:11:21,907
Who do you want to win,
Daddy or Whit?

1463
01:11:21,949 --> 01:11:24,952
- Who do you wanna win?
- Daddy, of course.

1464
01:11:24,993 --> 01:11:26,703
- If you're one
of the fun runners...
- What about you?

1465
01:11:26,745 --> 01:11:29,122
- it's just about
completing the course.
- Eat your toast.

1466
01:11:29,164 --> 01:11:31,708
And what a great turnout
we've got here today.

1467
01:11:43,971 --> 01:11:45,264
Why am I always the tortoise?

1468
01:11:45,305 --> 01:11:46,348
A bet's a bet.

1469
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:47,432
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

1470
01:11:47,474 --> 01:11:49,309
- Pardon me.
- All right.

1471
01:11:50,936 --> 01:11:52,437
Well, Dennis, I gotta admit...

1472
01:11:52,479 --> 01:11:54,314
I didn't think
you'd make it this far.

1473
01:11:54,606 --> 01:11:55,899
I mean, uh...

1474
01:11:55,941 --> 01:11:58,235
you don't exactly have
the best, uh, track record...

1475
01:11:58,277 --> 01:11:59,361
now, do you?

1476
01:11:59,403 --> 01:12:01,405
Yeah, well that was then,
and this is now.

1477
01:12:01,446 --> 01:12:02,948
No, Dennis.

1478
01:12:04,825 --> 01:12:06,326
This is now.

1479
01:12:12,082 --> 01:12:13,667
All right.

1480
01:12:17,629 --> 01:12:19,214
Don't feel you have to keep up
with me.

1481
01:12:19,256 --> 01:12:20,883
Well, don't feel
you have to keep up with me.

1482
01:12:20,924 --> 01:12:22,843
Oh, yeah, that's the spirit.

1483
01:12:22,885 --> 01:12:24,344
And they're off, Chris.

1484
01:12:24,386 --> 01:12:26,096
Yet another great marathon...

1485
01:12:26,138 --> 01:12:28,348
getting under way
here in London.

1486
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:32,644
And having these great runners
go 26.2 miles...

1487
01:12:32,686 --> 01:12:34,980
of crowded London streets...

1488
01:12:35,022 --> 01:12:36,857
That was great, what you did
with Jake yesterday, by the way.

1489
01:12:36,899 --> 01:12:37,900
Thanks.

1490
01:12:37,941 --> 01:12:39,610
I know Libby
really appreciated it, too.

1491
01:12:39,651 --> 01:12:40,694
Oh, I'm glad.

1492
01:12:40,736 --> 01:12:41,862
In fact,
she was so appreciative...

1493
01:12:41,904 --> 01:12:43,655
we had a nice little jump
on the bed.

1494
01:12:43,697 --> 01:12:45,616
- What?
- Have a good race.

1495
01:12:57,127 --> 01:12:58,295
Isn't it enough?

1496
01:12:58,337 --> 01:12:59,379
What?

1497
01:12:59,421 --> 01:13:01,965
You got the girl, all right?
Isn't it enough?

1498
01:13:02,007 --> 01:13:03,383
I just think it's high time
you realize...

1499
01:13:03,425 --> 01:13:05,052
that it's over, sir.

1500
01:13:05,093 --> 01:13:06,595
Otherwise, it's gonna be
very tough for you...

1501
01:13:06,637 --> 01:13:08,972
- when we move to Chicago.
- What?

1502
01:13:09,014 --> 01:13:10,557
You better
slow down there, chief.

1503
01:13:10,599 --> 01:13:11,934
You got a long way to go.

1504
01:13:11,975 --> 01:13:15,521
- Yeah, well, so have you.
- Oh, yeah!

1505
01:13:15,562 --> 01:13:16,772
Yes, I like it.

1506
01:13:16,813 --> 01:13:19,149
Run, fat boy, run!

1507
01:13:23,237 --> 01:13:24,863
I can lose weight...

1508
01:13:24,905 --> 01:13:27,241
but you'll always be
an asshole.

1509
01:13:27,741 --> 01:13:28,909
Now, once again,
it's still being dominated...

1510
01:13:28,951 --> 01:13:30,244
- by the Kenyans, Denise.
- Look at that.

1511
01:13:30,285 --> 01:13:32,871
The runners are making their way
along the embankment.

1512
01:13:32,913 --> 01:13:34,581
What a beautiful view of the...

1513
01:13:41,004 --> 01:13:42,714
So, here we are
among the leaders of the moment.

1514
01:13:42,756 --> 01:13:45,884
The pace is relatively relaxed
for the opening miles.

1515
01:13:47,553 --> 01:13:48,720
Maybe a little too relaxed,
Chris.

1516
01:13:48,762 --> 01:13:50,472
It looks like we've got
a couple of amateurs...

1517
01:13:50,514 --> 01:13:52,015
coming up from the back.

1518
01:13:55,894 --> 01:13:56,937
Mom!

1519
01:13:56,979 --> 01:13:58,647
It looks like these two boys...

1520
01:13:58,689 --> 01:14:00,649
are running a race
of their own here today.

1521
01:14:00,691 --> 01:14:01,942
In fact,
they're causing quite a stir...

1522
01:14:01,984 --> 01:14:03,151
among the serious runners.

1523
01:14:03,193 --> 01:14:04,903
Not something
you'd really expect...

1524
01:14:04,945 --> 01:14:06,405
at this stage in the race.

1525
01:14:06,446 --> 01:14:08,031
Oh. Sorry, sir.

1526
01:14:08,365 --> 01:14:09,867
There's a man down.

1527
01:14:11,285 --> 01:14:12,786
Sorry.

1528
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:16,290
All eyes right now
are on these two runners.

1529
01:14:16,331 --> 01:14:18,208
No, no, no, no, no.
What are you doing?

1530
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:21,044
- We hope to bring you
that information quickly.
- Slow down.

1531
01:14:21,211 --> 01:14:22,254
But he looks good, doesn't he?

1532
01:14:22,296 --> 01:14:23,547
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

1533
01:14:23,589 --> 01:14:26,216
...setting a new world record.

1534
01:14:30,888 --> 01:14:31,930
What are you trying to prove?

1535
01:14:31,972 --> 01:14:33,557
She doesn't
love you any more, man.

1536
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:34,892
I'm not doing this for Libby.

1537
01:14:34,933 --> 01:14:35,976
Yeah, right.

1538
01:14:36,018 --> 01:14:37,102
You're ridiculous, dude.

1539
01:14:37,144 --> 01:14:39,980
What's the matter, Whit,
can't keep up?

1540
01:14:48,864 --> 01:14:50,365
Oh!

1541
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:57,080
Daddy!

1542
01:14:57,122 --> 01:14:59,416
Dennis! I mean, Whit!

1543
01:15:04,838 --> 01:15:06,131
It does look very serious.

1544
01:15:06,173 --> 01:15:07,674
We're getting
some more information--

1545
01:15:24,942 --> 01:15:27,444
Stay down! Stay down!

1546
01:15:42,125 --> 01:15:43,502
Where do you think you're going?

1547
01:15:43,544 --> 01:15:46,296
- I have to go help Dennis.
- Why?

1548
01:15:46,338 --> 01:15:48,841
Because I am
the assistant coach.

1549
01:15:50,133 --> 01:15:51,301
Yes!

1550
01:15:51,343 --> 01:15:54,096
He now leads
at the ten-mile mark.

1551
01:15:57,015 --> 01:15:58,058
And that looks really painful.

1552
01:15:58,100 --> 01:15:59,518
Looks like
this runner's race day...

1553
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:01,603
will be ending
at a Leeds hospital.

1554
01:16:01,645 --> 01:16:03,021
Yeah, absolutely tragic--

1555
01:16:03,063 --> 01:16:04,648
Mom, do something!

1556
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:06,233
- We certainly do.
Let's get back...
- Come on.

1557
01:16:06,275 --> 01:16:08,068
to the leaders
in the female race.

1558
01:16:17,035 --> 01:16:18,537
Shit.

1559
01:16:44,897 --> 01:16:47,107
Huh?

1560
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:51,111
Gordon, I think I speak
for everyone here...

1561
01:16:51,153 --> 01:16:53,655
when I say, "Give me my money."

1562
01:16:53,697 --> 01:16:55,908
Five grand, please.

1563
01:16:58,076 --> 01:17:00,037
OK, here's the thing
about the money...

1564
01:17:00,078 --> 01:17:01,580
and, actually,
it's kind of funny.

1565
01:17:02,414 --> 01:17:04,666
Uh...I don't have it.

1566
01:17:06,710 --> 01:17:08,420
Would you excuse us a moment?

1567
01:17:13,133 --> 01:17:15,385
Hi. I'm looking
for a patient, Dennis Doyle.

1568
01:17:15,427 --> 01:17:16,887
Are you family?

1569
01:17:16,929 --> 01:17:18,514
- Yeah.
- Doyle?

1570
01:17:18,555 --> 01:17:20,474
Yes, Dennis Doyle.

1571
01:17:21,683 --> 01:17:22,976
Oh, I'm sorry,
we don't seem to have anyone...

1572
01:17:23,018 --> 01:17:24,603
registered by that name.

1573
01:17:24,645 --> 01:17:27,356
Are you sure?
He's a runner in the marathon.

1574
01:17:27,397 --> 01:17:28,815
Oh, the runner. Oh, yeah.

1575
01:17:28,857 --> 01:17:30,859
Well, he's just arrived.

1576
01:17:30,901 --> 01:17:32,569
- Libby?
- Whit?

1577
01:17:32,611 --> 01:17:33,904
How'd you know I was here?

1578
01:17:33,946 --> 01:17:35,364
What are you doing here?

1579
01:17:35,405 --> 01:17:37,616
Honey,
that psychopath tripped me.

1580
01:17:37,658 --> 01:17:40,285
He tripped me.
I think I have ligament damage.

1581
01:17:40,327 --> 01:17:41,912
Guys, can we-- Can we just--

1582
01:17:41,954 --> 01:17:44,373
Fellas, can we--
Look, I'm a patient, please.

1583
01:17:44,414 --> 01:17:45,999
Just one-- Find me!

1584
01:17:46,041 --> 01:17:47,626
Easy, easy! Ow!

1585
01:17:47,668 --> 01:17:49,670
Vince, look, when I said
I didn't have the money...

1586
01:17:49,711 --> 01:17:50,754
I meant
I didn't have the money here.

1587
01:17:50,796 --> 01:17:53,298
- I can pay.
- Oh, you're gonna pay.

1588
01:17:54,132 --> 01:17:57,219
No, wait. Look...Vincent.

1589
01:17:57,261 --> 01:17:58,887
Wait-- Wait-- What?

1590
01:17:58,929 --> 01:18:00,597
Wait. Wait a tick.

1591
01:18:05,477 --> 01:18:07,855
Not so bloody fast, mate.

1592
01:18:07,896 --> 01:18:09,231
Who the hell are you?

1593
01:18:09,273 --> 01:18:10,941
Thanks a lot, Mr G!

1594
01:18:10,983 --> 01:18:12,818
Your friend is a man of honour.

1595
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:13,902
What, Vincent?

1596
01:18:13,944 --> 01:18:17,823
Yes, he said he's going to kick
shit out of you later instead.

1597
01:18:17,865 --> 01:18:18,907
I don't understand.

1598
01:18:18,949 --> 01:18:21,910
On the TV, they said
he was being brought here.

1599
01:18:21,952 --> 01:18:23,370
One second.

1600
01:18:23,412 --> 01:18:24,872
I could sue him.
You know that, right?

1601
01:18:24,913 --> 01:18:26,206
I could sue him
for everyhing he has...

1602
01:18:26,248 --> 01:18:28,292
but, you know, seriously,
what am I gonna do...

1603
01:18:28,333 --> 01:18:31,587
with some pizza boxes
and a Judas Priest t-shirt?

1604
01:18:31,628 --> 01:18:33,338
Honey,
I'm sure it was an accident.

1605
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:35,048
Well, you weren't there, OK?

1606
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:37,217
You didn't see it.
He was wild-eyed, all right?

1607
01:18:37,259 --> 01:18:39,511
He was frothing at the mouth
at one point.

1608
01:18:39,553 --> 01:18:42,472
It was like running a marathon
with Cujo, OK?

1609
01:18:42,514 --> 01:18:45,809
Jake, buddy,
can I control the bed, please?

1610
01:18:45,851 --> 01:18:48,187
No, but you can watch me
control it.

1611
01:18:50,355 --> 01:18:51,899
Libby? Where are you?

1612
01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:53,275
- The hospital.
- Are you with him?

1613
01:18:53,317 --> 01:18:54,359
No, he's not here.

1614
01:18:54,401 --> 01:18:55,527
Well, what do you mean
he's not there?

1615
01:18:55,569 --> 01:18:57,362
I mean, he's not here.

1616
01:18:57,654 --> 01:18:59,531
Well,
where the hell is he then?

1617
01:19:29,436 --> 01:19:32,189
All right.
It's still-- It's on.

1618
01:19:32,231 --> 01:19:33,774
The race is still on.

1619
01:19:34,274 --> 01:19:36,944
I can't believe
you let Gordon go, Vincent.

1620
01:19:36,985 --> 01:19:38,195
- Yeah, but he said
he was gonna pay us...
- Back to the story.

1621
01:19:38,237 --> 01:19:40,197
- right, Vincent?
- The first images
are coming in...

1622
01:19:40,239 --> 01:19:42,115
- from what looks
like a camera phone...
- Vincent?

1623
01:19:42,157 --> 01:19:44,701
- Vincent?
- showing a lone,
mysterious runner.

1624
01:19:44,743 --> 01:19:48,163
Uh, he's looking very badly
injured, I must say...

1625
01:19:48,205 --> 01:19:50,624
and he's also causing
some major traffic--

1626
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,335
- Cab.
- Yeah, it's a Rolex.

1627
01:19:53,377 --> 01:19:55,921
I'm not gonna sell it.
It's a family heirloom now.

1628
01:19:56,547 --> 01:19:58,090
What!

1629
01:19:59,091 --> 01:20:01,051
Wait! What are you doing?!

1630
01:20:01,093 --> 01:20:04,179
- Step on it!
- You can't
just take a man's cab!

1631
01:20:05,639 --> 01:20:06,682
All right!

1632
01:20:06,723 --> 01:20:07,933
Hello, there...

1633
01:20:07,975 --> 01:20:09,935
Dennis Doyle from downstairs!

1634
01:20:09,977 --> 01:20:11,645
Who the hell are you?

1635
01:20:12,563 --> 01:20:14,481
You beauty, come on!

1636
01:20:15,399 --> 01:20:17,192
And as the sun
sets over London...

1637
01:20:17,234 --> 01:20:18,902
we're still looking
into the identity...

1638
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:21,780
of that mysterious runner.

1639
01:20:21,822 --> 01:20:24,366
Come on, Dennis,
you can do it! Come on!

1640
01:20:24,408 --> 01:20:26,285
The only concrete thing
we do know...

1641
01:20:26,326 --> 01:20:30,289
is that he's running
for erectile dysfunction.

1642
01:20:31,790 --> 01:20:33,750
Good news, Mr Bloom.

1643
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:36,128
No rupture, no ligament damage.

1644
01:20:36,170 --> 01:20:37,838
Oh, that's great.

1645
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:38,964
Jake, please?

1646
01:20:39,006 --> 01:20:42,217
In fact,
there's no real damage anywhere.

1647
01:20:42,718 --> 01:20:43,802
Are you sure, doctor?

1648
01:20:43,844 --> 01:20:45,470
Jake, please.

1649
01:20:45,512 --> 01:20:47,681
It's, uh, like, uh...

1650
01:20:47,723 --> 01:20:48,765
What is it you runners say?

1651
01:20:48,807 --> 01:20:50,726
You hit the wall.

1652
01:20:52,186 --> 01:20:54,313
No, no, that--
That's not possi--

1653
01:20:55,814 --> 01:20:57,107
God damn it, will you stop...

1654
01:20:57,149 --> 01:20:59,651
messin' around with the bed,
you little shit?!

1655
01:21:00,861 --> 01:21:02,362
God.

1656
01:21:08,452 --> 01:21:10,787
Good evening.
It's time for a sports update.

1657
01:21:10,829 --> 01:21:12,664
Top story, the Nike River Run.

1658
01:21:12,706 --> 01:21:14,625
We'll be chatting to the winner
a little bit later on...

1659
01:21:14,666 --> 01:21:17,169
but first, we've had thousands
of e-mails and calls...

1660
01:21:17,211 --> 01:21:18,879
about our mystery runner.

1661
01:21:18,921 --> 01:21:20,672
Well, I can tell you now,
our TV crew...

1662
01:21:20,714 --> 01:21:21,840
has just caught up with him.

1663
01:21:21,882 --> 01:21:22,925
Excuse me. Sorry.

1664
01:21:22,966 --> 01:21:24,551
Will you slow down, please?

1665
01:21:30,224 --> 01:21:31,975
You hungry?
You wanna get a bite?

1666
01:21:32,017 --> 01:21:33,894
Stop! Stop!

1667
01:21:33,936 --> 01:21:35,646
Everyone out. Get out.

1668
01:21:36,522 --> 01:21:37,606
- Come on!
- I'm goin'!

1669
01:21:37,648 --> 01:21:38,857
Hey!

1670
01:21:38,899 --> 01:21:40,526
Just go away!

1671
01:21:40,984 --> 01:21:42,236
- Somebody trip him.
- Go away!

1672
01:21:42,277 --> 01:21:43,654
Knock him over.

1673
01:21:43,695 --> 01:21:45,906
No, invalid. Off-side.

1674
01:21:46,323 --> 01:21:48,200
- Oh!
- Leave him alone! Get off him!

1675
01:21:48,242 --> 01:21:50,035
I want my money now!

1676
01:21:50,077 --> 01:21:51,745
Don't listen to them, Dennis!

1677
01:21:51,787 --> 01:21:52,829
You are a winner!

1678
01:21:52,871 --> 01:21:53,997
I want my money now!

1679
01:21:54,039 --> 01:21:56,542
Stop it! I'm wearing helmet!

1680
01:21:56,583 --> 01:21:57,626
Clear off!

1681
01:21:57,668 --> 01:22:00,003
"The loneliness
of the long-distance runner"...

1682
01:22:00,045 --> 01:22:03,382
a phrase epitomized by this man,
Dennis Doyle.

1683
01:22:03,423 --> 01:22:05,175
For the last eleven miles,
he's been running...

1684
01:22:05,217 --> 01:22:08,470
on what appears to be
a severely sprained ankle.

1685
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:11,765
What a testament to the power
of the human spirit.

1686
01:22:11,807 --> 01:22:13,350
Mr Doyle, how do you feel?

1687
01:22:13,392 --> 01:22:14,810
How the fuck
do you think I feel?

1688
01:22:14,852 --> 01:22:16,228
What an inspiration.

1689
01:22:16,270 --> 01:22:19,022
We'll keep you updated
as this story progresses.

1690
01:22:19,064 --> 01:22:21,024
- Get out of the bloody way!
- Sorry.

1691
01:22:21,066 --> 01:22:23,277
- Well, what a remarkable day...
- Libby. Libby, I'm sorry...

1692
01:22:23,318 --> 01:22:25,070
- we've had at
the marathon on the Thames...
- all right? I lost it. I--

1693
01:22:25,112 --> 01:22:26,822
- with an event
dominated as ever...
- I wasn't thinking.

1694
01:22:26,864 --> 01:22:28,657
- by the crowds
and the fun runners...
- I'm sorry.

1695
01:22:28,699 --> 01:22:30,284
- Honey, can we just--
- but particularly by

1696
01:22:30,325 --> 01:22:31,410
- Jake, buddy...
- one man.

1697
01:22:31,451 --> 01:22:32,494
would you mind just giving us...

1698
01:22:32,536 --> 01:22:34,413
a little peace with the TV,
please?

1699
01:22:34,538 --> 01:22:35,581
- Thank you.
- Go on, Dennis!

1700
01:22:35,622 --> 01:22:36,623
The whole of London...

1701
01:22:36,665 --> 01:22:39,376
Honey, can we
just talk about this, please?

1702
01:22:42,337 --> 01:22:44,381
- Chin up!
- Keep it up, mate!

1703
01:22:45,799 --> 01:22:47,342
Do you know, Mr Doyle, sir?

1704
01:22:47,384 --> 01:22:48,427
Oh.

1705
01:22:48,468 --> 01:22:50,304
I'm the assistant coach.

1706
01:22:50,345 --> 01:22:52,014
Oh. Oh, really.
What's your name?

1707
01:22:52,055 --> 01:22:55,309
- Uh, Mr Ghoshdashtidar.
- Gosh--

1708
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:56,393
- Ghosh...
- Gah--

1709
01:22:56,435 --> 01:22:58,520
OK, just call me John.

1710
01:22:59,396 --> 01:23:02,733
It was me who discovered
his potential.

1711
01:23:06,904 --> 01:23:08,697
I can't breathe.

1712
01:23:09,114 --> 01:23:10,365
My head's gonna explode.

1713
01:23:10,407 --> 01:23:12,117
He's not gonna make it.

1714
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:13,785
I-- I have to stop.

1715
01:23:13,827 --> 01:23:15,287
- I have to stop this.
- No.

1716
01:23:15,329 --> 01:23:16,455
- I'm sorry.
- No, you can't.
What are you doing?

1717
01:23:16,496 --> 01:23:17,748
You can't stop.
You're nearly there.

1718
01:23:17,789 --> 01:23:19,333
What? How much further?

1719
01:23:19,374 --> 01:23:23,128
It-- It's a little, tiny--
Nine miles.

1720
01:23:25,964 --> 01:23:28,008
OK. OK.

1721
01:23:43,106 --> 01:23:44,775
Oh, no.

1722
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:46,985
What?

1723
01:23:47,986 --> 01:23:49,655
He's hit it.

1724
01:24:08,715 --> 01:24:10,926
OK, baby,
let's get you to bed.

1725
01:24:11,301 --> 01:24:12,344
Jakey.

1726
01:24:12,386 --> 01:24:14,471
-...by the crowds
and the fun runners.
- Dennis.

1727
01:24:14,513 --> 01:24:16,056
- For those of you
just joining us...
- Dennis?

1728
01:24:16,098 --> 01:24:18,851
it looks like Dennis Doyle, a
clothing store security guard...

1729
01:24:18,892 --> 01:24:20,936
running for the last ten
and three quarter hours...

1730
01:24:20,978 --> 01:24:22,896
on basically one leg...

1731
01:24:22,938 --> 01:24:26,567
is refusing to rest
until this race is run.

1732
01:24:26,608 --> 01:24:29,111
Unbelievable!

1733
01:24:58,348 --> 01:25:01,643
You've never finished anything
in your entire life, Dennis.

1734
01:25:03,353 --> 01:25:05,731
All you're gonna
wanna do is give up.

1735
01:25:05,772 --> 01:25:07,191
I'm not the quitter!

1736
01:25:07,232 --> 01:25:09,318
That's exactly
what you're gonna do, Dennis.

1737
01:25:09,359 --> 01:25:11,528
Go on, run away!
Run away!

1738
01:25:11,570 --> 01:25:13,572
That's what you always do!

1739
01:25:16,366 --> 01:25:17,826
Dennis!

1740
01:25:19,786 --> 01:25:21,288
Dennis!

1741
01:25:24,374 --> 01:25:26,210
Dennis?

1742
01:25:33,926 --> 01:25:35,427
Oh, I don't believe this.

1743
01:25:35,469 --> 01:25:36,887
Yeah, boy, yes!

1744
01:25:36,929 --> 01:25:38,514
He's still going!

1745
01:25:38,555 --> 01:25:41,808
Go on, you beautiful man!

1746
01:25:41,850 --> 01:25:43,852
Apologies there,
ladies and gentlemen, uh...

1747
01:25:43,894 --> 01:25:46,563
but it's, uh, really rather hard
not to get caught up...

1748
01:25:46,605 --> 01:25:48,440
in the drama of it all.

1749
01:25:49,066 --> 01:25:52,110
Now let's take one more look
at how Dennis broke that ankle.

1750
01:25:52,152 --> 01:25:53,278
And here it is.

1751
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:54,780
It appears
that the runner there...

1752
01:25:54,821 --> 01:25:58,200
next to Mr Doyle
is involved in some way.

1753
01:25:58,242 --> 01:26:01,954
In fact, if we look at it again
here...yes!

1754
01:26:01,995 --> 01:26:04,248
He deliberately trips him!

1755
01:26:04,289 --> 01:26:05,874
Bastard!

1756
01:26:05,916 --> 01:26:07,292
Apologies again, uh...

1757
01:26:07,334 --> 01:26:09,336
That didn't--
That's not what happened.

1758
01:26:09,378 --> 01:26:10,879
That is--
That-- That didn't happen.

1759
01:26:10,921 --> 01:26:12,589
I can't believe this.

1760
01:26:12,631 --> 01:26:13,674
I don't believe it, either.

1761
01:26:13,715 --> 01:26:14,758
I don't understand that.

1762
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:15,843
What is that?

1763
01:26:15,884 --> 01:26:17,344
Honey. Honey...

1764
01:26:17,386 --> 01:26:21,974
That angle makes it look, but--
He tripped me.

1765
01:26:22,641 --> 01:26:24,560
He tripped me! Yes, he did!

1766
01:26:24,601 --> 01:26:27,688
- Go, Dennis!
- It's him! Dennis!

1767
01:26:29,273 --> 01:26:30,941
Go, Dennis!

1768
01:26:34,236 --> 01:26:35,612
I can't believe this.

1769
01:26:35,654 --> 01:26:36,947
Come on, honey.

1770
01:26:36,989 --> 01:26:38,782
Please, like I'm gonna do that.

1771
01:26:39,032 --> 01:26:40,367
What are you--
Are you kidding me?

1772
01:26:40,409 --> 01:26:41,994
Honey.

1773
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:44,371
All right, look,
I'm just-- I'm not--

1774
01:26:44,413 --> 01:26:46,373
I'm not myself, OK?

1775
01:26:47,124 --> 01:26:48,834
I haven't been myself
for a long time.

1776
01:26:48,876 --> 01:26:50,794
Work has not been...

1777
01:26:51,211 --> 01:26:53,172
It's, uh...

1778
01:26:53,213 --> 01:26:54,214
It's just this city, you know?

1779
01:26:54,256 --> 01:26:56,300
It's just--
It's really hard here for me.

1780
01:26:56,341 --> 01:26:57,968
You know,
everyone's so polite here...

1781
01:26:58,010 --> 01:27:00,095
and it's like the food and the--
and the--and the ca--

1782
01:27:00,137 --> 01:27:01,555
I just don't-- I don't
know what happened to me.

1783
01:27:01,597 --> 01:27:03,390
I don't know what--
It's just this place.

1784
01:27:03,432 --> 01:27:04,558
It's this place, you know?

1785
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:07,603
And if we-- I just know it's
gonna be better once we move.

1786
01:27:07,644 --> 01:27:09,271
- Move?
- To Chicago.

1787
01:27:09,313 --> 01:27:10,606
What?

1788
01:27:10,647 --> 01:27:11,899
Too soon?

1789
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:12,983
Oh!

1790
01:27:13,025 --> 01:27:14,610
- Come on, Jake.
- Libby, wh--

1791
01:27:14,651 --> 01:27:16,320
Where you goin'?
Where you goin'?

1792
01:27:16,987 --> 01:27:18,947
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
Dennis?

1793
01:27:18,989 --> 01:27:20,282
You can't be serious.

1794
01:27:20,324 --> 01:27:23,660
The guy left you
at the altar pregnant.

1795
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:26,872
Nobody's perfect.

1796
01:27:27,623 --> 01:27:28,707
Libby.

1797
01:27:28,749 --> 01:27:30,417
Libby! L--

1798
01:27:30,459 --> 01:27:31,543
What a shithead.

1799
01:27:31,585 --> 01:27:33,086
Jake.

1800
01:27:34,004 --> 01:27:35,672
Hey. I know you feel bad.

1801
01:27:35,714 --> 01:27:36,840
I know you're
in incredible pain...

1802
01:27:36,882 --> 01:27:39,676
but you are so close
to me going on holiday.

1803
01:27:40,135 --> 01:27:41,637
Come on.

1804
01:27:56,568 --> 01:27:59,238
Dennis! Dennis! Dennis!

1805
01:27:59,279 --> 01:28:02,491
Dennis! Dennis! Dennis!

1806
01:28:02,533 --> 01:28:06,828
Dennis! Dennis! Dennis!

1807
01:28:06,870 --> 01:28:09,623
As we draw tantalizingly
close to the finish line...

1808
01:28:09,665 --> 01:28:11,458
here at St. Paul's Cathedral...

1809
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:13,961
it's safe to say,
it's been a very long day...

1810
01:28:14,002 --> 01:28:15,879
for myself and my cameraman.

1811
01:28:15,921 --> 01:28:18,841
It's been a very long day
for you watching at home...

1812
01:28:18,882 --> 01:28:19,925
but for Dennis Doyle...

1813
01:28:19,967 --> 01:28:22,928
it's been the single longest day
of his life.

1814
01:28:37,442 --> 01:28:38,944
Come on, Dennis!

1815
01:28:39,528 --> 01:28:41,029
Good work, Dennis!

1816
01:28:44,867 --> 01:28:46,451
Hey! Move along!

1817
01:28:46,493 --> 01:28:47,536
That's it. You're there.

1818
01:28:47,578 --> 01:28:49,329
You're sixty feet.

1819
01:28:49,371 --> 01:28:51,123
Fifty-- Fifty-eight feet.

1820
01:28:51,748 --> 01:28:53,000
Call it fifty-six
and a half feet...

1821
01:28:53,041 --> 01:28:54,084
and you're there. Come on.

1822
01:28:54,126 --> 01:28:57,671
That's my man! My man!

1823
01:29:05,971 --> 01:29:07,514
Come on, come on!

1824
01:29:16,023 --> 01:29:17,524
Dennis, come on.

1825
01:29:19,276 --> 01:29:21,486
Stay down, you shamble of a man.

1826
01:29:21,528 --> 01:29:23,113
Don't get up.

1827
01:29:24,865 --> 01:29:26,325
Dennis!

1828
01:29:26,909 --> 01:29:28,035
Dennis, come on, get up.

1829
01:29:28,076 --> 01:29:30,037
Dennis, you're
at the finish line. Get up.

1830
01:29:30,704 --> 01:29:32,414
Dennis, this looks bad.
People are talking.

1831
01:29:32,456 --> 01:29:33,957
Get up.

1832
01:29:47,596 --> 01:29:49,097
Hello, Dennis?

1833
01:29:53,060 --> 01:29:55,437
- Dennis!
- Dad!

1834
01:30:00,567 --> 01:30:02,903
Dennis!

1835
01:30:02,945 --> 01:30:04,446
Dad!

1836
01:30:21,171 --> 01:30:23,340
Go on! You've got it! Go on!

1837
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:28,762
Come on, Dennis! Yeah!

1838
01:30:32,307 --> 01:30:33,809
Yeah!

1839
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:39,481
Dad!

1840
01:30:39,731 --> 01:30:42,359
That was a really stupid thing
you did out there today.

1841
01:30:42,401 --> 01:30:44,319
Don't go to Chicago.

1842
01:30:44,361 --> 01:30:46,321
Dad, you won!

1843
01:30:50,409 --> 01:30:51,743
He's done it!

1844
01:30:51,785 --> 01:30:53,537
He's actually done it!

1845
01:30:53,579 --> 01:30:54,746
This morning...

1846
01:30:54,788 --> 01:30:58,333
Dennis Doyle was a humble
shop worker from North London!

1847
01:30:58,375 --> 01:31:01,003
Tonight, he goes home a hero!

1848
01:31:01,044 --> 01:31:02,880
Oh, yay.

1849
01:31:02,921 --> 01:31:04,214
And look at that!

1850
01:31:04,256 --> 01:31:05,465
- God damn it.
- This extraordinary man...

1851
01:31:05,507 --> 01:31:07,467
collapses into the arms of--

1852
01:31:07,509 --> 01:31:10,012
I think it's backwards here--
the woman he loves!

1853
01:31:10,053 --> 01:31:12,598
And, look! He's got a son!

1854
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:14,766
I didn't know he had a son!

1855
01:31:14,808 --> 01:31:16,768
Did you know he had a son?

1856
01:31:27,613 --> 01:31:29,823
- Hello, Dennis.
- Hey.

1857
01:31:42,961 --> 01:31:44,546
- Hi.
- Hi.

1858
01:31:44,588 --> 01:31:46,381
Jake, your dad's here!

1859
01:31:46,423 --> 01:31:47,966
How's it goin'?

1860
01:31:48,008 --> 01:31:49,384
- Pretty good.
- Good.

1861
01:31:49,426 --> 01:31:50,761
- You?
- Yeah.

1862
01:31:50,802 --> 01:31:52,304
Yeah, not bad.

1863
01:31:52,346 --> 01:31:53,555
You still running?

1864
01:31:53,597 --> 01:31:55,974
Every day, hopefully
in the right direction.

1865
01:31:59,269 --> 01:32:01,313
Yeah. So...

1866
01:32:02,356 --> 01:32:06,735
Um, Libby,
I was thinkin', um...

1867
01:32:08,820 --> 01:32:11,657
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, you.

1868
01:32:14,117 --> 01:32:15,160
Uh, it doesn't matter,
actually.

1869
01:32:15,202 --> 01:32:16,495
I'll, um...

1870
01:32:16,537 --> 01:32:17,871
I'll sp-- I'll ca--
I'll speak to you later.

1871
01:32:17,913 --> 01:32:19,498
- OK.
- Say goodbye to your mom.

1872
01:32:19,540 --> 01:32:20,707
Bye, Mom.

1873
01:32:20,749 --> 01:32:21,792
Bye. I'll see you later.

1874
01:32:21,834 --> 01:32:23,460
Bye.

1875
01:32:33,387 --> 01:32:35,389
Libby, I was wondering,
would you like to go...

1876
01:32:35,430 --> 01:32:37,766
and have some dinner
with me next week?

1877
01:32:42,479 --> 01:32:43,480
You don't have to.
It's not, uh...

1878
01:32:43,522 --> 01:32:44,773
Yeah.

1879
01:32:44,815 --> 01:32:46,191
Uh...huh?

1880
01:32:46,233 --> 01:32:47,818
I mean, wow.

1881
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:49,027
It'd be nice.

1882
01:32:49,069 --> 01:32:51,363
Yeah. Well, it would be.

1883
01:32:55,242 --> 01:32:57,077
I'll, um...
I'll give you a call.

1884
01:32:57,119 --> 01:32:58,203
OK.

1885
01:32:58,245 --> 01:33:00,163
Don't know why I did that.
It's just--

1886
01:33:01,331 --> 01:33:02,749
OK. Ready?

1887
01:33:02,791 --> 01:33:04,251
Yeah.

1888
01:33:06,295 --> 01:33:08,172
Hello!

1889
01:33:08,213 --> 01:33:10,174
Hello, Dennis!

1890
01:33:11,383 --> 01:33:13,051
Mr G.

1891
01:33:13,177 --> 01:33:15,179
- Hello, Jake.
- Hello.

1892
01:33:15,220 --> 01:33:16,930
I was just doing my spin class.

1893
01:33:16,972 --> 01:33:18,015
It's great fun, isn't it?

1894
01:33:18,056 --> 01:33:20,893
Oh, it's an amazing workout!

1895
01:33:26,732 --> 01:33:28,483
Dad comin' up behind
the young contender.

1896
01:33:28,525 --> 01:33:29,776
Come on! Jake!

1897
01:33:29,818 --> 01:33:31,486
Oh, he takes the ball from Jake!

1898
01:33:31,528 --> 01:33:33,989
He has the ball! He's clear!

1899
01:33:34,031 --> 01:33:35,866
Dad! Pass it!

1900
01:33:36,825 --> 01:33:37,868
Dad is clear!

1901
01:33:37,910 --> 01:33:39,703
Give it!

1902
01:33:39,745 --> 01:33:41,622
I'll give you one, too.

1903
01:33:41,663 --> 01:33:43,790
OK, let's go. Good game.

1904
01:33:43,832 --> 01:33:45,918
Jake to Mr G.

1905
01:33:46,335 --> 01:33:47,836
Yeah, thank you very much.

1906
01:33:47,878 --> 01:33:49,421
Take over, Mr G.

1907
01:33:50,255 --> 01:33:51,882
There you go, Mr G.

1908
01:33:52,341 --> 01:33:55,219
All right, I'm gonna--
Completely illegal move there.

1909
01:33:55,260 --> 01:33:57,137
Picks up the player,
runs with him.

1910
01:33:57,179 --> 01:33:58,597
Runs with him all the way.

1911
01:33:58,639 --> 01:34:00,599
Dad, that's illegal!

1912
01:34:05,020 --> 01:34:06,522
But that's not all.

1913
01:34:06,813 --> 01:34:08,899
Because the guy,
he can't barely walk, OK...

1914
01:34:08,941 --> 01:34:10,984
Iet alone run,
but he keeps going...

1915
01:34:11,026 --> 01:34:13,862
and twenty-five miles
on a shattered ankle.

1916
01:34:13,904 --> 01:34:15,030
And you know how he did that?

1917
01:34:15,072 --> 01:34:16,281
You know what he said
was the one thing...

1918
01:34:16,323 --> 01:34:17,824
that kept him going?

1919
01:34:18,575 --> 01:34:19,910
His trainer
never gave up on him.

1920
01:34:19,952 --> 01:34:21,828
He stayed with him
the whole way.

1921
01:34:21,870 --> 01:34:22,913
And that was you?

1922
01:34:22,955 --> 01:34:24,081
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

1923
01:34:24,122 --> 01:34:25,791
It's a pretty amazing story,
actually.

1924
01:34:25,832 --> 01:34:27,334
I've got a bottle of champagne
opened here...

1925
01:34:27,376 --> 01:34:28,836
