1
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:47,655
#Holdin' hands at midnight
'neath a starry sky #

2
00:00:48,656 --> 00:00:50,867
# Nice work if you can get it #

3
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,953
# And you can get it
if you try #

4
00:00:55,037 --> 00:01:00,835
# Strollin' with that one girl,
sighin' sigh after sigh #

5
00:01:00,918 --> 00:01:03,755
# Nice work if you can get it #

6
00:01:03,838 --> 00:01:07,675
# And you can get it
if you try #

7
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:13,931
# Just imagine someone
waitin' at the cottage door #

8
00:01:14,015 --> 00:01:16,017
# Where two hearts become one #

9
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,437
- # Who could ask
for anything more? #
- Mmm!

10
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,730
That looks good enough to eat.

11
00:01:20,813 --> 00:01:22,440
Oh, thank you.

12
00:01:22,523 --> 00:01:24,400
I wasn't talking about the cake.

13
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:27,153
Oh, Gordon. You're my cousin.

14
00:01:27,236 --> 00:01:29,113
Never stopped
the Royal Family.

15
00:01:29,197 --> 00:01:30,364
You're a very sick man.

16
00:01:30,448 --> 00:01:32,825
Mm. Hi.

17
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:34,452
- Hi.
- You're yummy.

18
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:38,748
Oh, Mum, would you take Grandma
over to the church, please?

19
00:01:38,831 --> 00:01:40,458
Yes. Come on, sweetheart.

20
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:41,918
So, do you wanna go and
tell Dennis that we're ready?

21
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,669
Sure thing.

22
00:01:43,753 --> 00:01:44,754
How's he doing?

23
00:01:44,837 --> 00:01:46,547
Oh, great. Thrilled.

24
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:50,134
I'm telling you, he's thrilled.

25
00:01:58,267 --> 00:02:00,311
Dennis, it's Gordon.
Are you ready?

26
00:02:03,731 --> 00:02:07,068
Wow! You look great!

27
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:10,863
So, are you ready?

28
00:02:10,947 --> 00:02:12,073
Um...

29
00:02:13,783 --> 00:02:15,201
- Just...
- OK.

30
00:02:15,284 --> 00:02:17,620
I'm gonna give you a minute
to, uh...

31
00:02:17,703 --> 00:02:18,788
give you a minute.

32
00:02:25,294 --> 00:02:27,880
No, no. I don't want to.

33
00:02:27,964 --> 00:02:29,966
Done want to, ah...

34
00:02:34,345 --> 00:02:35,430
Dennis!

35
00:02:35,513 --> 00:02:38,099
It's time.
Dennis, we have to go.

36
00:02:38,975 --> 00:02:40,101
Dennis!

37
00:02:41,185 --> 00:02:42,270
Dennis!

38
00:02:45,606 --> 00:02:48,359
# Where to promise
to love one... #

39
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,946
Dennis, we're gonna have a baby.

40
00:02:54,866 --> 00:02:55,950
Dennis.

41
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,745
Dennis?

42
00:02:59,328 --> 00:03:03,666
# Who could ask
for anything more? #

43
00:03:11,382 --> 00:03:12,884
Aw, shit.

44
00:03:19,307 --> 00:03:20,641
Dennis!

45
00:03:23,311 --> 00:03:24,771
Dennis!

46
00:03:26,063 --> 00:03:28,483
# I'm sorry, sorry, sorry
if you're gettin' me wrong #

47
00:03:28,566 --> 00:03:31,235
# But you're half a world away
with only one sock on #

48
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:34,238
# Now you're gettin' too much,
I don't want to play along #

49
00:03:34,322 --> 00:03:37,116
# 'Cause all I really wanted
was a radio song #

50
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,785
# What is there to say #

51
00:03:38,868 --> 00:03:39,911
# What is there to say?

52
00:03:39,994 --> 00:03:41,287
# In a world so grey? #

53
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,413
# In a world so grey #

54
00:03:42,497 --> 00:03:47,043
# Why, oh, why, oh, why
are we singing it anyway? #

55
00:03:48,336 --> 00:03:49,337
- Come on!
- # 'Cause you think I had #

56
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,172
- # A wind-up heart #
- Stop!

57
00:03:51,255 --> 00:03:53,925
- # Then you must
have had plastic head #
- Come back!

58
00:03:54,008 --> 00:03:56,094
- # Did you think
I had to play the part? #
- Give me a break!

59
00:03:56,177 --> 00:03:59,055
# When you copied everyhing
I said? #

60
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:01,724
- # When the tide of love is out
and the rust begins to show #
- Whoo!

61
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,101
# You're cryin'
in your sleep #

62
00:04:03,184 --> 00:04:04,227
# Scared of your shadow #

63
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,520
- # If you thought
this was forever #
- Ooh!

64
00:04:05,603 --> 00:04:07,647
- Oh!
- # Dear,
I'm keeping you in mind #

65
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:08,815
Gotcha. Where is it?

66
00:04:08,898 --> 00:04:09,899
Where's what?

67
00:04:09,982 --> 00:04:10,983
You know what I'm talkin' about!

68
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:12,235
Ooh! Hey! Hey!

69
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:13,319
Ooh!

70
00:04:13,403 --> 00:04:14,404
All right!

71
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:15,488
What do you
think this is, huh?

72
00:04:15,571 --> 00:04:16,823
I've never seen those
before in my life.

73
00:04:16,906 --> 00:04:18,825
Yeah, and you're
a fit, running type.

74
00:04:18,908 --> 00:04:19,951
You bastard.

75
00:04:20,034 --> 00:04:21,035
Don't.

76
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,161
Little shit!

77
00:04:22,245 --> 00:04:23,413
There's nothing to see here,
people.

78
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:24,580
Ow!

79
00:04:32,964 --> 00:04:33,965
Where's the bra?

80
00:04:34,048 --> 00:04:35,133
What bra?

81
00:04:37,093 --> 00:04:38,219
Whoo!

82
00:04:38,302 --> 00:04:40,221
Come on, fat boy, run!

83
00:04:40,304 --> 00:04:41,514
I'm not fat!

84
00:04:41,597 --> 00:04:43,266
I'm just-- I'm unfit.

85
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,768
Go on, then.

86
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:49,313
Ow!

87
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,018
Yes?

88
00:05:27,101 --> 00:05:29,061
Could you let me in, please,
Mr G?

89
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:32,899
Who the hell are you?

90
00:05:32,982 --> 00:05:35,026
You-- Why are we--

91
00:05:35,109 --> 00:05:37,236
It's Dennis Doyle
from downstairs.

92
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,238
Dennis Doyle from downstairs
is dead...

93
00:05:39,322 --> 00:05:40,448
killed by his landlord.

94
00:05:40,531 --> 00:05:41,783
- Do you know why?
- No.

95
00:05:41,866 --> 00:05:44,952
Failure to pay the rent
in a timely fashion.

96
00:05:45,036 --> 00:05:46,162
Dennis!

97
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:47,789
Hey, Maya.
Listen, can you tell your dad...

98
00:05:47,872 --> 00:05:48,873
I'm in a bit of a hurry?

99
00:05:48,956 --> 00:05:50,958
- Have you got any money?
- Maya, go inside!

100
00:05:53,461 --> 00:05:54,921
And put something on.

101
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:57,882
Hello. Hello.

102
00:05:57,965 --> 00:05:59,801
Yes?

103
00:05:59,884 --> 00:06:00,968
Do you know what happened
to that landlord...

104
00:06:01,052 --> 00:06:03,137
after he killed Dennis Doyle
from downstairs?

105
00:06:03,221 --> 00:06:05,348
- No.
- They gave him a medal...

106
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:08,309
and a nice foot massage.

107
00:06:09,852 --> 00:06:11,938
Hey, Mr Ghoshdashtidar.

108
00:06:12,021 --> 00:06:14,357
Mr Ghoshdashtidar, wait--

109
00:06:27,662 --> 00:06:29,872
Well, how is the old rascal?

110
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:33,084
I hear it's going to be a party
of special magnificence.

111
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:34,335
You know Bilbo.

112
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:35,878
He's got
the whole place in an uproar.

113
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,630
Mm. Ah, well,
that should please him.

114
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,717
Jake, your dad's gonna be here
in a minute.

115
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:42,969
You ready?

116
00:06:43,052 --> 00:06:44,595
Ready!

117
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:47,056
All right,
then keep your secrets.

118
00:06:49,225 --> 00:06:50,935
Hey.

119
00:06:51,018 --> 00:06:52,812
- # You give me tone #
- Hey.

120
00:06:52,895 --> 00:06:54,981
# I'll like that #

121
00:06:55,064 --> 00:06:56,816
Hey, how is it goin'?

122
00:06:56,899 --> 00:06:58,818
- Oh, yeah.
- # All the chrome #

123
00:06:58,901 --> 00:07:00,945
# Well, I'll like that #

124
00:07:01,028 --> 00:07:03,448
Dennis. Yeah, Dennis.

125
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:04,699
# Do you run away? #

126
00:07:04,782 --> 00:07:07,285
You like, uh, to have some sort
of drink with me?

127
00:07:07,368 --> 00:07:08,745
Oh, what the hell. Let's--

128
00:07:12,206 --> 00:07:13,291
Ow, shit!

129
00:07:13,374 --> 00:07:14,625
Oh!

130
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:16,085
- Hah!
- Aah!

131
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,837
No. Oh, you got me!

132
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,089
- Hi.
- Hi.

133
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,424
- We're playing
hobbits and orcs.
- Mm-hmm.

134
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:22,717
Guess who's an orc?

135
00:07:24,302 --> 00:07:25,845
Honey, would you mind, uh...

136
00:07:25,928 --> 00:07:28,014
This kind of smarts. Can you?

137
00:07:28,097 --> 00:07:29,182
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

138
00:07:29,265 --> 00:07:30,475
I'm not finished
with you, Whit!

139
00:07:30,558 --> 00:07:32,018
Yeah, one sec.

140
00:07:32,101 --> 00:07:33,436
Uh, I thought his dad
was picking him up.

141
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,605
- What happened?
- Oh, what happened?

142
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:36,814
Dennis happened.

143
00:07:36,898 --> 00:07:38,900
Mmm. Well, on the bright side...

144
00:07:38,983 --> 00:07:41,360
- Hmm?
- you look astonishingly
beautiful today.

145
00:07:41,444 --> 00:07:42,528
- Whit!
- Really.

146
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:49,952
Where have you been?

147
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:51,454
Hey.

148
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:52,622
- I was--
- Daddy!

149
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:54,457
Hey, snot-face!

150
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,875
Oh, please, don't call him that.

151
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,376
Why?
He is a snot-face, isn't he?

152
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,253
You are a snot-face,
aren't you? Huh?

153
00:07:59,337 --> 00:08:00,546
Oh.

154
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,631
Aw!

155
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:03,299
Jake, that's disgusting.

156
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:04,801
Jake, that's disgusting.
Go on.

157
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,595
- Toilet first.
- Mom!

158
00:08:07,678 --> 00:08:10,098
Go on. Grab your jacket.

159
00:08:12,016 --> 00:08:14,060
You were supposed to be here
an hour ago, Dennis.

160
00:08:14,143 --> 00:08:15,645
Yeah, there was a bit
of a mix-up with the--

161
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:17,355
with the tickets, so...

162
00:08:17,438 --> 00:08:18,606
Hey, you look really nice.

163
00:08:18,689 --> 00:08:19,816
Did I get you that necklace?

164
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,068
No. It was a...

165
00:08:22,151 --> 00:08:24,445
just a present
from someone...else.

166
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:26,739
- Who?
- Uh, me, actually.

167
00:08:26,823 --> 00:08:27,824
Oh, yeah.

168
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:28,908
Huh?

169
00:08:28,991 --> 00:08:30,618
It belonged to my grandmother.

170
00:08:30,701 --> 00:08:31,786
Yeah.

171
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:33,663
Huh?

172
00:08:34,705 --> 00:08:37,333
Dennis, this is
my good friend, Whit.

173
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:40,545
Whit, this is my--
Jake's dad, Dennis.

174
00:08:40,628 --> 00:08:41,963
How you doin'?

175
00:08:42,797 --> 00:08:44,340
Good, yeah.
You have soft hands.

176
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:45,633
Do you moisturize?

177
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:47,677
I do, actually.

178
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:50,596
Well, it's very nice
to meet you.

179
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,598
It's nice to finally put a face
to the name.

180
00:08:52,682 --> 00:08:53,683
I'd have probably thought
you'd have...

181
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,268
you would have seen
one of our photos.

182
00:08:56,185 --> 00:08:57,353
Oh, there aren't any.

183
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,105
- Hmm.
- Ready?

184
00:08:59,188 --> 00:09:01,149
Yes. Let's go.

185
00:09:01,232 --> 00:09:02,483
- Have fun.
- Yeah.

186
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:05,528
Dennis, you do have
the tickets, right?

187
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:08,364
Libby, credit me
with some intelligence.

188
00:09:13,995 --> 00:09:15,121
Tickets!

189
00:09:15,204 --> 00:09:17,290
Does anybody have any tickets?

190
00:09:17,373 --> 00:09:18,708
Mate, my daughter's
not very well.

191
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,084
I've got a couple of
spare tickets if you want 'em.

192
00:09:20,168 --> 00:09:21,669
Yes. Thank you so much.
How much?

193
00:09:21,753 --> 00:09:22,837
Oh, whatever.

194
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,380
Uh, this is
all the money I have.

195
00:09:25,882 --> 00:09:26,883
Yeah?

196
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,259
My son is gonna love me.

197
00:09:28,342 --> 00:09:30,303
You want your son to love you?
Don't break the law.

198
00:09:30,386 --> 00:09:32,305
Hey, that's entrapment!

199
00:09:32,388 --> 00:09:34,015
Oh, God!

200
00:09:34,098 --> 00:09:35,808
And that's brutality!

201
00:09:37,393 --> 00:09:40,813
Libby, it's--
It was only a caution.

202
00:09:42,356 --> 00:09:44,108
No. Uh, Libby, I'll--

203
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:45,276
- Bye, Dad.
- Libby.

204
00:09:58,414 --> 00:09:59,957
So, do you work with Libby
at the bakery?

205
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:02,418
No.

206
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:04,504
We met at the bakery, though.

207
00:10:04,587 --> 00:10:06,089
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

208
00:10:07,256 --> 00:10:08,257
What?

209
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,718
No, I just was
a nervous wreck that day.

210
00:10:10,802 --> 00:10:12,053
It took me
four chocolate eclairs...

211
00:10:12,136 --> 00:10:14,889
and a macaroon just to get up
the courage to talk to her.

212
00:10:17,391 --> 00:10:20,228
Uh, no, I work in
the financial district actually.

213
00:10:21,145 --> 00:10:23,523
I'm a hedge fund manager
for Waterman Hughes.

214
00:10:23,606 --> 00:10:24,899
Oh.

215
00:10:24,982 --> 00:10:27,276
I do high-level security
analysis and operation...

216
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,736
for an upscale retail outlet.

217
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,238
Really?

218
00:10:30,321 --> 00:10:32,115
Libby said
you were a security guard...

219
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,408
at a women's clothing store.

220
00:10:33,491 --> 00:10:35,159
Yeah, that's what I said.

221
00:10:36,285 --> 00:10:37,745
Right.

222
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:39,997
Uh, well, l--
I should probably get a cab.

223
00:10:40,081 --> 00:10:41,749
I got a big run in the morning.

224
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,334
A big what?

225
00:10:43,418 --> 00:10:46,295
A run-- I'm training for
the Nike River Run next month.

226
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,380
The what-y what what?

227
00:10:47,463 --> 00:10:48,714
The Nike River Run.

228
00:10:48,798 --> 00:10:51,509
It's a-- It's a marathon race
along the, uh, Thames River.

229
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,970
Why would you do that?

230
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,888
Uh, well, it's
a charity thing, you know?

231
00:10:55,972 --> 00:10:56,973
Plus, I love to run.

232
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:59,767
I actually ran the London
Marathon a little while ago.

233
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:00,852
Oh, that's a coincidence.

234
00:11:00,935 --> 00:11:01,936
Oh, yeah? How's that?

235
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:03,479
I watched it on the television.

236
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:04,647
- Ah.
- Well, the last hour.

237
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,399
I sleep in on a Sunday, so...

238
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:08,943
Right.

239
00:11:09,026 --> 00:11:11,362
Um, well, look, you know...

240
00:11:11,446 --> 00:11:13,531
I know these things can be
pretty awkward, you know?

241
00:11:13,614 --> 00:11:15,158
I mean, you know,
you're Jake's dad...

242
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:18,619
and, uh, well,
I just want you to know...

243
00:11:18,703 --> 00:11:24,542
that I like Libby and Jake
very, very much...

244
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:28,713
and, um, well, I just appreciate
your being so grown up...

245
00:11:28,796 --> 00:11:30,006
about this, you know?

246
00:11:30,465 --> 00:11:31,674
Hey! Yo!

247
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:33,009
You wanna take this one?

248
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:34,260
- No, you have it.
- You sure?

249
00:11:34,343 --> 00:11:35,595
Yeah. I'll get the next one.

250
00:11:35,678 --> 00:11:37,138
All right.
Very nice to meet you.

251
00:11:37,221 --> 00:11:38,806
- Yeah.
- I'm sure I'll see you around.

252
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,725
Yup. Hope so.

253
00:11:40,808 --> 00:11:43,644
Hello, good sir.
West lndia Quay, please.

254
00:11:46,147 --> 00:11:47,148
- Bye.
- Bye.

255
00:11:47,231 --> 00:11:48,733
- See ya.
- Bye-bye.

256
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:18,721
Dennis!

257
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:21,891
Dennis!

258
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:26,104
Dennis?

259
00:12:28,022 --> 00:12:29,023
- Close your eyes.
- Huh?

260
00:12:29,107 --> 00:12:30,608
- Close your eyes.
- Oh.

261
00:12:34,737 --> 00:12:36,864
OK. Open them.
Happy Valentine's.

262
00:12:38,866 --> 00:12:40,493
That's great.

263
00:13:09,105 --> 00:13:10,189
Dennis!

264
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:12,984
Dennis!

265
00:13:27,248 --> 00:13:28,332
Hi.

266
00:14:13,294 --> 00:14:14,378
Hey, Vincent.

267
00:14:15,838 --> 00:14:17,256
- Dennis.
- How's business?

268
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,382
Whatcha mean, "business"?

269
00:14:18,466 --> 00:14:19,592
Sorry.

270
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:25,264
- Got it.
- Shh.

271
00:14:25,348 --> 00:14:26,390
Hush now, man.

272
00:14:26,474 --> 00:14:27,767
All right.

273
00:14:32,021 --> 00:14:33,231
Three thousand.

274
00:14:37,568 --> 00:14:38,903
This is all I've got.

275
00:14:39,695 --> 00:14:41,614
Just throw whatever you have
in the pot.

276
00:14:41,697 --> 00:14:43,741
OK.

277
00:14:43,825 --> 00:14:44,992
Flush, king high.

278
00:14:49,163 --> 00:14:50,289
Ace high.

279
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:57,797
What happened?

280
00:15:01,926 --> 00:15:02,927
Bad luck, mate.

281
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,345
Oh.

282
00:15:05,346 --> 00:15:07,098
Oh, hey, I got you
those tickets.

283
00:15:07,181 --> 00:15:08,599
They were for yesterday.

284
00:15:08,683 --> 00:15:09,684
What?
So now you don't want 'em?

285
00:15:09,767 --> 00:15:11,227
Why would I want them?

286
00:15:13,271 --> 00:15:14,272
Put them on eBay.

287
00:15:14,355 --> 00:15:15,565
Who's gonna wanna buy tickets...

288
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:16,983
for something
that happened yesterday?

289
00:15:17,066 --> 00:15:18,651
- Time travellers.
- Where were you?

290
00:15:18,735 --> 00:15:20,945
My whole night
was just screwed, man...

291
00:15:21,028 --> 00:15:24,073
and I looked like a prick in
front of Libby's new boyfriend.

292
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:25,950
Oh, she didn't tell me
she has a new boyfriend.

293
00:15:26,033 --> 00:15:27,201
What's he like?

294
00:15:28,202 --> 00:15:29,912
Handsome, well-off, friendly.

295
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:33,040
He's like Peter Perfect
out of Wacky Races...

296
00:15:33,124 --> 00:15:34,417
and he runs marathons.

297
00:15:35,877 --> 00:15:37,336
- Why?
- Exactly.

298
00:15:41,466 --> 00:15:44,510
Well, look, my only
serious relationship ended...

299
00:15:44,594 --> 00:15:46,971
in a broken collarbone
and a dead meerkat...

300
00:15:47,054 --> 00:15:49,015
so I may not be the best person
in the world to give advice...

301
00:15:49,098 --> 00:15:51,642
but you have been trying
to get through to Libby...

302
00:15:51,726 --> 00:15:53,519
for five years now...

303
00:15:53,603 --> 00:15:56,230
so maybe you should let her go.

304
00:15:56,314 --> 00:15:57,940
Yeah,
but what is her problem?

305
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:00,693
Dennis, you left her
at the altar...

306
00:16:00,777 --> 00:16:01,986
when she was pregnant.

307
00:16:02,945 --> 00:16:04,489
But that was ages ago.

308
00:16:04,572 --> 00:16:07,533
Well, women remember that stuff.

309
00:16:08,618 --> 00:16:10,119
Look, if there's anything else
I can do to help...

310
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:11,954
just let me know.

311
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:14,123
Well, actually, I am
a little bit behind in my rent.

312
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:15,750
I was wondering if you had
a couple of hundred quid...

313
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,335
I could maybe borrow.

314
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,554
Oh, I love you. I really do.

315
00:16:28,638 --> 00:16:30,515
I needed that actually.

316
00:16:30,598 --> 00:16:32,809
That's great. Thank you.
I'll see you later.

317
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:41,234
How about this one?

318
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,405
I bet you can't do it.

319
00:16:46,781 --> 00:16:48,449
- I can do a big one.
- Go on.

320
00:16:51,494 --> 00:16:52,578
Look, look, look, look, look.

321
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,000
That was a good one.

322
00:16:58,084 --> 00:16:59,168
Yeah.

323
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:00,962
Listen.

324
00:17:01,045 --> 00:17:03,297
I'm really sorry about
gettin' you arrested yesterday.

325
00:17:03,381 --> 00:17:04,382
That's all right.

326
00:17:04,465 --> 00:17:05,758
Most universities
don't even look...

327
00:17:05,842 --> 00:17:07,218
at things
like that these days.

328
00:17:08,219 --> 00:17:09,554
Hey, another one.

329
00:17:09,637 --> 00:17:11,347
As far as I'm concerned,
what else do you have?

330
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:13,057
- Oh, she was great.
- Yeah, well, she is--

331
00:17:13,141 --> 00:17:14,475
Ooh!

332
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:16,728
- Shh.
- Sorry.

333
00:17:16,811 --> 00:17:17,812
Um, but, yeah, so I think--

334
00:17:17,895 --> 00:17:19,480
Do you want to hear a secret?

335
00:17:19,564 --> 00:17:20,565
Absolutely.

336
00:17:20,648 --> 00:17:22,442
There's a girl in my class
called Emily.

337
00:17:22,525 --> 00:17:24,318
Well, I'm sure
that's not a secret.

338
00:17:24,402 --> 00:17:25,945
The teachers probably know
about her.

339
00:17:26,028 --> 00:17:27,280
She looks like a tree frog.

340
00:17:27,363 --> 00:17:28,364
She what?

341
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:29,991
She looks like a tree frog.

342
00:17:30,074 --> 00:17:31,993
That's not
a very nice thing to say.

343
00:17:32,076 --> 00:17:33,411
I like tree frogs.

344
00:17:33,494 --> 00:17:34,620
Oh, yeah?

345
00:17:34,704 --> 00:17:35,788
More than hobbits?

346
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:39,459
I see.

347
00:17:39,542 --> 00:17:41,794
I really feel
we can make a life together.

348
00:17:41,878 --> 00:17:43,171
"You really think we could--"

349
00:17:43,254 --> 00:17:45,173
Wait, that sounds like something
Whit would say.

350
00:17:45,256 --> 00:17:46,591
He did say it.

351
00:17:46,674 --> 00:17:48,801
- What? To Mom?
- Yes.

352
00:17:48,885 --> 00:17:50,094
What a shithead.

353
00:17:50,178 --> 00:17:51,179
Dad!

354
00:17:51,262 --> 00:17:52,346
Sorry.

355
00:17:54,849 --> 00:17:56,267
Listen, I'm really glad
you were such a big boy...

356
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,727
about not gettin'
into the whole...

357
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,020
Lord of the Rings thing,
you know?

358
00:17:59,103 --> 00:18:00,104
That's OK.

359
00:18:00,188 --> 00:18:01,647
Whit's got us front row seats
for tomorrow...

360
00:18:01,731 --> 00:18:02,857
so it's even better.

361
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,442
What a shithead.

362
00:18:04,525 --> 00:18:05,610
Dad!

363
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:07,070
Well.

364
00:18:13,201 --> 00:18:14,285
# Ah, yeah #

365
00:18:17,371 --> 00:18:18,456
# Oh, yeah #

366
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,460
# I'm up
on the eleventh floor #

367
00:18:22,543 --> 00:18:25,088
# And I'm watchin'
the cruisers below #

368
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,217
# He's down on the street #

369
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,053
# And he's tryin' hard
to pull sister Flo #

370
00:18:34,555 --> 00:18:36,516
# Oh, my heart's
in the basement #

371
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:39,310
# My weekend's
at an all-time low #

372
00:18:41,562 --> 00:18:43,231
# 'Cause she's hopin' to score #

373
00:18:43,314 --> 00:18:45,817
# So I can't see her
letting him go #

374
00:18:47,652 --> 00:18:49,320
# You betcha #

375
00:18:49,404 --> 00:18:50,780
# Oh, yeah #

376
00:18:51,906 --> 00:18:52,990
# Uh-huh #

377
00:18:59,622 --> 00:19:00,665
Deliveries are downstairs.

378
00:19:00,748 --> 00:19:02,500
- No, I'm--
- Waterman Hughes.

379
00:19:06,087 --> 00:19:07,672
- Yes?
- Bonjour.

380
00:19:12,593 --> 00:19:13,719
Whit!

381
00:19:16,806 --> 00:19:17,890
Thanks for your help.

382
00:19:18,975 --> 00:19:20,601
So, what brings you
down here, man?

383
00:19:20,685 --> 00:19:22,854
A little, uh, high-level
security analysis...

384
00:19:22,937 --> 00:19:24,230
in retail operation?

385
00:19:24,313 --> 00:19:25,440
Huh?

386
00:19:25,523 --> 00:19:27,442
What can I do for you?
I'm just on my way to the gym.

387
00:19:27,525 --> 00:19:29,902
- I got a spin class.
- Huh?

388
00:19:29,986 --> 00:19:32,196
Spinning?
You know, spinning, bicycles?

389
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,281
Oh, OK.

390
00:19:33,364 --> 00:19:35,450
No, I was thinking more
along the lines of a pint.

391
00:19:35,533 --> 00:19:37,326
A pint? Oh, a pint.

392
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,287
Uh, wow.

393
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:41,164
Um, I'd love a pint, actually...

394
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:42,707
but, uh, I really gotta hit
this class.

395
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,292
I'm in training, you know?

396
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,668
You wanna come along?

397
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:47,420
Uh, it's an amazing workout.

398
00:19:47,503 --> 00:19:49,547
I-- I'd love to, but I don't
have any gear, so--

399
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:50,757
Well, I'll lend you some.

400
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:52,925
Great.

401
00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:54,927
Three, two, one!

402
00:19:55,011 --> 00:19:56,554
We're climbing!
Rhythm is up!

403
00:19:56,637 --> 00:20:00,683
Push! Push! Push! Push!

404
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:02,268
Keep it up!

405
00:20:02,351 --> 00:20:04,103
No cheating! Let's go!

406
00:20:04,187 --> 00:20:05,563
How you doin' there?
You all right?

407
00:20:05,646 --> 00:20:06,647
What'd you say?

408
00:20:06,731 --> 00:20:08,816
Out of the saddle!
We're climbing!

409
00:20:10,818 --> 00:20:12,653
OK,
let's make it really hard!

410
00:20:14,655 --> 00:20:16,324
So, what did you wanna
talk to me about, man?

411
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:20,411
Ow!

412
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:23,956
Jake said you had some tickets
to the, uh...

413
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,625
to the hobbit musical.

414
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,502
Yeah, a friend of mine's
an investor in the show.

415
00:20:27,585 --> 00:20:29,587
He totally hooked me up.
Can you believe that?

416
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:32,423
Hmm...um...

417
00:20:32,507 --> 00:20:34,592
I was just thinking, um...

418
00:20:34,675 --> 00:20:35,676
you know,
you don't really wanna sit...

419
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,888
through a whole sort of
three-hour kind of show, do you?

420
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:42,183
- So...
- Well, the thing is...

421
00:20:42,934 --> 00:20:44,018
Oh.

422
00:20:44,852 --> 00:20:47,230
Jake's really kind of got
his heart set on this, you know?

423
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:48,398
Yeah.

424
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,650
- Powder?
- I'm fine.

425
00:20:50,733 --> 00:20:51,943
You sure? Refreshing.

426
00:20:52,026 --> 00:20:53,694
I would imagine it is.

427
00:20:53,778 --> 00:20:56,864
I was just-- I'm thinkin' maybe,
you know, if you like...

428
00:20:56,948 --> 00:20:59,617
then I could maybe take Jake
and Libby for you, you know...

429
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,828
if--if you want.

430
00:21:01,911 --> 00:21:04,914
Look, I know you must be
kind of angry at yourself...

431
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,916
for messing up with the tickets
the other night...

432
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,459
and, uh, I'd like to help you.

433
00:21:08,543 --> 00:21:10,378
I really would, but, um...

434
00:21:11,796 --> 00:21:12,880
Well, the thing is...

435
00:21:12,964 --> 00:21:15,550
I hope to be more and more
a part of Jake's life, you know?

436
00:21:15,633 --> 00:21:19,137
And, uh, frankly, I'm kind
of looking forward to this show.

437
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,681
Give Jake and l, a chance to get
to know each other better.

438
00:21:21,764 --> 00:21:24,183
I mean, uh, you can see
my point, can't you?

439
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:26,310
Yes, I can.

440
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:30,022
So, can I ask you a question?

441
00:21:30,106 --> 00:21:31,232
Sure.

442
00:21:31,315 --> 00:21:33,526
You had her once,
why did you ever let her go?

443
00:21:33,985 --> 00:21:34,986
To be honest, Whit--

444
00:21:35,069 --> 00:21:37,029
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'd just
be careful on the stairs here.

445
00:21:37,113 --> 00:21:38,531
Your legs
might be a little rubbery.

446
00:21:39,407 --> 00:21:40,491
I'm fine.

447
00:21:43,745 --> 00:21:45,538
Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.

448
00:21:45,621 --> 00:21:46,873
I'm fine. I'm--

449
00:21:46,956 --> 00:21:49,041
Yeah, the first step
is often the, uh...

450
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,209
the difficult one.

451
00:21:51,002 --> 00:21:52,712
This is Libby.
Leave me a message.

452
00:21:52,795 --> 00:21:54,922
Hey, Lib, it's me.
Can you give me a ring?

453
00:22:03,931 --> 00:22:06,225
Fuck!

454
00:22:14,358 --> 00:22:15,526
Who the hell are you?

455
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,236
Just open the bloody door.

456
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,529
OK.

457
00:23:04,117 --> 00:23:06,327
- There you go. Enjoy.
- Thank you.

458
00:23:06,411 --> 00:23:08,329
- Forty-eight.
- Yes.

459
00:23:08,413 --> 00:23:09,497
Hello.

460
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,082
Dennis, I'm really busy.

461
00:23:11,165 --> 00:23:12,250
Can we talk?

462
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:14,460
No, just buy something or go.

463
00:23:14,544 --> 00:23:18,256
OK. I, can I have one of your
signature cupcakes, please?

464
00:23:19,507 --> 00:23:20,925
Actually,
can I have this big one?

465
00:23:21,008 --> 00:23:22,009
- Dennis.
- That one's fine...

466
00:23:22,093 --> 00:23:23,886
and, uh, I like that one, too.

467
00:23:25,263 --> 00:23:27,098
- Anything else?
- Um, yeah.

468
00:23:27,181 --> 00:23:28,725
What do you see in Whit?

469
00:23:28,808 --> 00:23:31,477
- Uh, forty-nine.
- Yes, I'm forty-nine.

470
00:23:31,561 --> 00:23:33,396
- What can I get for you?
- No, I'm not done yet.

471
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:34,647
Yes, you are.

472
00:23:34,731 --> 00:23:36,941
Sorry, I think you've used up
your allotted time.

473
00:23:37,024 --> 00:23:39,736
You don't-- You don't have
allotted time, OK?

474
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:41,446
Now you're using up
my allotted time.

475
00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:43,197
You don't get
allotted time, OK?

476
00:23:43,281 --> 00:23:44,532
It's not like a game show,
you know?

477
00:23:44,615 --> 00:23:47,118
You got, like, fifteen seconds
to win a bun.

478
00:23:47,201 --> 00:23:48,953
Goodbye, Dennis.

479
00:23:49,036 --> 00:23:50,037
Yes?

480
00:23:50,121 --> 00:23:52,123
Yes. Hello, yes.

481
00:23:52,206 --> 00:23:55,626
Um, do you have any of those
little gingerbread rabbits?

482
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,044
Oh, no.
We just have those at Easter.

483
00:23:57,128 --> 00:23:58,254
I'm so sorry.

484
00:23:58,337 --> 00:23:59,422
Oh.

485
00:24:00,548 --> 00:24:01,841
Hmm...

486
00:24:06,304 --> 00:24:09,348
Do you have anything else
shaped like an animal?

487
00:24:09,432 --> 00:24:10,433
- Excuse me.
- What?

488
00:24:10,516 --> 00:24:12,518
I haven't paid for my order.

489
00:24:13,102 --> 00:24:14,145
I'm sorry.

490
00:24:14,228 --> 00:24:15,229
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

491
00:24:15,313 --> 00:24:16,773
Excuse me.

492
00:24:18,608 --> 00:24:19,942
- Ow!
- Sorry.

493
00:24:21,444 --> 00:24:22,987
Seriously,
what do you see in him?

494
00:24:23,071 --> 00:24:24,864
OK, he's well-off, all right?

495
00:24:24,947 --> 00:24:26,532
He's kind of-- He's quite
good-looking, you know?

496
00:24:26,616 --> 00:24:27,617
But I mean, so what?

497
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,243
Is that what you think
this is about?

498
00:24:29,327 --> 00:24:31,329
I just want
some gorgeous sugar daddy.

499
00:24:31,412 --> 00:24:32,663
I wouldn't say gorgeous.

500
00:24:32,747 --> 00:24:33,998
Well,
that's not why I'm with him.

501
00:24:34,082 --> 00:24:35,249
Well, why are you with him?

502
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:36,459
You know,
give me one good reason.

503
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:38,503
One? I could give you fifty.

504
00:24:38,586 --> 00:24:40,838
- I'm fifty!
- Hang on a minute!

505
00:24:40,922 --> 00:24:44,300
He's mature, responsible,
considerate...

506
00:24:44,383 --> 00:24:45,676
he's great with Jake.

507
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,720
- That's only four.
- Hello?

508
00:24:47,804 --> 00:24:50,389
You know what?
He's a good man, Dennis.

509
00:24:50,473 --> 00:24:53,059
You know, he runs marathons
for charity, for Pete's sake.

510
00:24:53,142 --> 00:24:54,644
Oh, big deal!

511
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:56,562
So you could run a marathon?

512
00:24:56,646 --> 00:24:58,856
Could I have
a chocolate brownie, please?

513
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,316
- Hang on!
- Oh!

514
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,151
Look, Libby, I can change.

515
00:25:02,235 --> 00:25:04,737
Yeah? Well, great.
Let's get married.

516
00:25:04,821 --> 00:25:06,280
- Really?
- No!

517
00:25:06,364 --> 00:25:08,366
We tried that once, remember?

518
00:25:08,449 --> 00:25:10,868
You left me at the altar,
pregnant.

519
00:25:10,952 --> 00:25:12,412
You cock!

520
00:25:13,204 --> 00:25:14,705
Look, Libby, I can change, OK?

521
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:16,749
I have changed. I can prove it.

522
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:18,251
How?

523
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:23,172
I'll tell you.
I will run the marathon.

524
00:25:25,007 --> 00:25:26,426
What?

525
00:25:26,509 --> 00:25:27,510
The one that Whit's doin'...

526
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:29,512
I'll run that,
and I'll finish it.

527
00:25:29,595 --> 00:25:30,680
Come on,
you've never finished...

528
00:25:30,763 --> 00:25:32,890
anything in your entire life,
Dennis.

529
00:25:32,974 --> 00:25:35,059
Oh, now, you-- That's not--

530
00:25:35,143 --> 00:25:36,769
- You know--
- Look, You can't
even finish a sentence.

531
00:25:36,853 --> 00:25:37,854
Don't--don't--

532
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:39,605
You're just bein',
you know, what's the word?

533
00:25:39,689 --> 00:25:40,690
Cock?

534
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:42,900
I would settle for something
shaped like a fish.

535
00:25:42,984 --> 00:25:43,985
Well, go to the fishmonger!

536
00:25:44,068 --> 00:25:45,862
I'm a vegetarian.

537
00:25:45,945 --> 00:25:48,072
OK. OK.

538
00:25:48,156 --> 00:25:49,699
Dennis, just please leave.

539
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:52,076
OK. OK, I'll go.

540
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,578
But I'm gonna
prove this to you, Libby.

541
00:25:53,661 --> 00:25:56,956
I can be mature, considerate,
and responsible.

542
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:00,084
- Oh!
- Dennis?

543
00:26:00,168 --> 00:26:01,335
Yes, Libby?

544
00:26:02,712 --> 00:26:04,297
It's two pounds, seventy-five.

545
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,923
Oh, yeah, right.

546
00:26:07,383 --> 00:26:08,968
Hey, if Dennis thinks
he can run the race...

547
00:26:09,051 --> 00:26:10,094
he can run the race.

548
00:26:10,178 --> 00:26:11,554
- Thank you.
- There's no way

549
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:13,222
you can run a marathon.

550
00:26:13,306 --> 00:26:15,892
- Why not?
- 'Cause you is a lazy bastard.

551
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:17,977
Hey, I'll have you know
I go to spin classes.

552
00:26:18,061 --> 00:26:19,687
You went to one.

553
00:26:19,771 --> 00:26:21,522
Yeah, and now
you walk like John Wayne.

554
00:26:22,774 --> 00:26:24,233
Hey, this is important to me.

555
00:26:25,485 --> 00:26:26,778
I mean it!

556
00:26:26,861 --> 00:26:30,948
Look, I'm sick of
being a nearly man, all right?

557
00:26:31,032 --> 00:26:32,033
I'm sick of being scared.

558
00:26:32,116 --> 00:26:33,451
I'm sick of the regret
I feel every day...

559
00:26:33,534 --> 00:26:35,787
'cause I didn't have the guts
to marry the woman I love!

560
00:26:37,497 --> 00:26:39,499
All that ends
tomorrow at 6 A.M.

561
00:27:17,995 --> 00:27:19,914
# Ow! #

562
00:27:41,269 --> 00:27:42,353
Not bad.

563
00:27:59,245 --> 00:28:00,329
Hi.

564
00:28:02,415 --> 00:28:03,583
Feel better?

565
00:28:03,666 --> 00:28:05,126
Much.

566
00:28:05,209 --> 00:28:07,336
Oh, how was spin class?

567
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:11,674
Uh, it was...
It was an amazing workout.

568
00:28:12,842 --> 00:28:14,218
Is that right?

569
00:28:14,302 --> 00:28:15,803
Yeah. And I also thought
it would be...

570
00:28:15,887 --> 00:28:17,764
a good chance for me
to get to know Whit...

571
00:28:17,847 --> 00:28:19,515
a little bit better, so...

572
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:21,726
Well, maybe we should all go out
for dinner then.

573
00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:22,977
- You think?
- Yeah.

574
00:28:23,061 --> 00:28:24,771
And then we could go dancing.

575
00:28:24,854 --> 00:28:26,773
- You're jokin'.
- No, not at all.

576
00:28:26,856 --> 00:28:29,317
And then, afterwards,
we could come back here...

577
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,651
and have a threesome.

578
00:28:32,361 --> 00:28:33,654
Oh. You are joking.

579
00:28:33,738 --> 00:28:34,989
Of course, I am.

580
00:28:35,073 --> 00:28:36,240
Look, Dennis, I don't know
what's going on...

581
00:28:36,324 --> 00:28:37,658
in that head of yours,
but whatever it is...

582
00:28:37,742 --> 00:28:39,368
- I don't like it.
- I've-- There's nothing--

583
00:28:39,452 --> 00:28:41,204
- Daddy!
- Hey, buddy.

584
00:28:41,287 --> 00:28:42,330
- You ready for school?
- Yeah.

585
00:28:42,413 --> 00:28:44,499
Wait up, wait up, wait up a sec.

586
00:28:46,626 --> 00:28:47,919
Can I walk with you guys?

587
00:28:48,002 --> 00:28:49,087
OK.

588
00:28:50,254 --> 00:28:51,672
- I'll see you later.
- OK.

589
00:28:53,674 --> 00:28:54,759
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

590
00:28:55,593 --> 00:28:56,719
All right, you ready?

591
00:28:56,803 --> 00:28:57,887
Yeah.

592
00:29:05,061 --> 00:29:08,689
So, Whit, you were, uh, 'round
at Libby's pretty early, eh?

593
00:29:08,773 --> 00:29:10,358
Whit stayed over last night.

594
00:29:10,441 --> 00:29:11,692
- Oh?
- Yes.

595
00:29:11,776 --> 00:29:12,944
They were jumping on the bed.

596
00:29:14,237 --> 00:29:15,321
Wow.

597
00:29:17,448 --> 00:29:20,576
Hey, Jakey, guess what?
Uh, I spoke to my friend...

598
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,703
and he does have an extra ticket
for the show tonight.

599
00:29:22,787 --> 00:29:25,373
What do you say
we, uh, ask Emily to come along?

600
00:29:25,456 --> 00:29:26,916
Yeah!

601
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:28,918
- Yay.
- What, he told you about Emily?

602
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:30,086
Oh, yeah.

603
00:29:31,212 --> 00:29:32,380
Oh, and, uh...

604
00:29:32,463 --> 00:29:35,425
Libby tells me that you
decided to run the marathon?

605
00:29:35,508 --> 00:29:36,551
Yeah.

606
00:29:36,634 --> 00:29:38,886
That's great, man. Seriously.

607
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:40,221
Really, that's awesome.

608
00:29:40,304 --> 00:29:41,431
Thank you.

609
00:29:41,514 --> 00:29:42,515
How did you manage to get in?

610
00:29:42,598 --> 00:29:43,599
What do you mean?

611
00:29:43,683 --> 00:29:45,226
Well, you can't
just show up and run.

612
00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:46,310
Well, why not?

613
00:29:46,394 --> 00:29:47,729
You have to apply in advance.

614
00:29:48,688 --> 00:29:49,772
Well, how far in advance?

615
00:29:49,856 --> 00:29:51,315
Uh, three months.

616
00:29:51,399 --> 00:29:52,400
And when is it again?

617
00:29:52,483 --> 00:29:53,901
Three weeks.

618
00:29:53,985 --> 00:29:54,986
Right.

619
00:29:55,069 --> 00:29:56,362
They'll make exceptions
sometimes...

620
00:29:56,446 --> 00:29:58,781
if you're running for a charity,
but, uh, you know...

621
00:29:58,865 --> 00:30:01,617
each charity is only allowed
a certain amount of runners.

622
00:30:01,701 --> 00:30:03,161
No, you don't have to worry
about me.

623
00:30:03,244 --> 00:30:04,412
I'll get in.

624
00:30:04,495 --> 00:30:05,830
All right.

625
00:30:05,913 --> 00:30:08,040
You ever, uh,
run a marathon before?

626
00:30:08,124 --> 00:30:09,375
No. Why?

627
00:30:10,418 --> 00:30:11,627
It's pretty gruelling.

628
00:30:11,711 --> 00:30:14,088
Well, yeah, that's why
they call it a marathon.

629
00:30:15,673 --> 00:30:17,675
Yeah, actually, technically,
it's called a marathon...

630
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:20,219
because of the events
of 490 B.C.

631
00:30:20,303 --> 00:30:21,804
There was a Greek soldier...

632
00:30:21,888 --> 00:30:22,889
- named Phei--
- Say, can I just...

633
00:30:22,972 --> 00:30:24,557
- stop you there?
- Yeah.

634
00:30:25,516 --> 00:30:27,518
I've got have nothing to say.
I just wanted to stop you there.

635
00:30:32,899 --> 00:30:34,484
All right, all right.

636
00:30:35,651 --> 00:30:37,904
Hello. Is that
the Cats Protection League?

637
00:30:38,821 --> 00:30:39,822
Hello. I was just--

638
00:30:39,906 --> 00:30:41,199
I'm-- I'm running a marathon
next month...

639
00:30:41,282 --> 00:30:43,159
and I was wondering if I could
possibly run on your behalf?

640
00:30:45,036 --> 00:30:46,496
Great. Yeah, yeah.

641
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:48,790
OK. I see.

642
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:51,709
How big is the costume?

643
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,921
OK. I'll call you back.

644
00:30:56,756 --> 00:30:58,174
Ooh.

645
00:30:58,257 --> 00:30:59,342
Hi.

646
00:31:00,384 --> 00:31:01,677
- Dennis.
- Oh, yes?

647
00:31:01,761 --> 00:31:03,638
Would you mind not doing that
in front of the customers?

648
00:31:03,721 --> 00:31:05,848
Sorry. I went for a run
this morning in my trunks...

649
00:31:05,932 --> 00:31:07,600
and I think
I've got a bit of a rash...

650
00:31:07,683 --> 00:31:09,394
you know,
down there in the, uh...

651
00:31:09,477 --> 00:31:11,187
- I understand.
- scrotal zone.

652
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:13,314
- I understand, Dennis.
- OK.

653
00:31:13,398 --> 00:31:16,067
Please, keep your hands
out of the scrotal zone...

654
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,318
whilst you're at work.

655
00:31:17,402 --> 00:31:18,528
Will do.

656
00:31:56,691 --> 00:31:57,775
Shh.

657
00:31:58,985 --> 00:32:00,153
Dennis!

658
00:32:02,697 --> 00:32:03,781
Sorry. I was, um...

659
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:06,576
I was in the zone.

660
00:32:09,787 --> 00:32:12,957
So, um, I'd actually
be dressed as a brain.

661
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,293
Um, can I call you back?

662
00:32:24,802 --> 00:32:26,971
# Just 'cause you think it #

663
00:32:27,055 --> 00:32:29,348
# It don't make it so #

664
00:32:29,432 --> 00:32:32,101
# Drive you to drink #

665
00:32:32,185 --> 00:32:34,729
# Won't let you go #

666
00:32:34,812 --> 00:32:39,067
# Plenty of girls
and boys in love #

667
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,151
Come on!

668
00:32:40,234 --> 00:32:42,153
# Plenty of girls #

669
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,656
# And boys in love #

670
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,162
Would you like a cup of tea,
Dennis?

671
00:32:55,833 --> 00:32:57,877
So that's it.

672
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,295
Running this marathon
could be my last chance...

673
00:32:59,378 --> 00:33:01,047
to show Libby that I can change.

674
00:33:04,592 --> 00:33:05,760
Mmm.

675
00:33:07,637 --> 00:33:10,139
You know what I would do
if I were you?

676
00:33:10,223 --> 00:33:11,224
What?

677
00:33:11,307 --> 00:33:13,726
I would get some cream
for that rash.

678
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,605
Let me ask you something,
Dennis.

679
00:33:17,688 --> 00:33:21,692
Why did you leave your lady at
the altar when she was pregnant?

680
00:33:21,776 --> 00:33:23,111
I don't know.
Just wasn't ready.

681
00:33:25,405 --> 00:33:29,992
The toothpaste was already
out of the tube, my friend.

682
00:33:30,701 --> 00:33:32,995
Being ready
had nothing to do with it.

683
00:33:34,372 --> 00:33:35,748
I was scared.

684
00:33:35,832 --> 00:33:36,916
Mmm.

685
00:33:38,084 --> 00:33:39,585
So, you are a coward.

686
00:33:40,795 --> 00:33:42,463
I thought we were just
gonna have a cup of tea.

687
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,551
You did not think
you were good enough.

688
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,138
Am I right?

689
00:33:50,221 --> 00:33:52,348
You thought of your lady,
and you were terrified...

690
00:33:52,432 --> 00:33:53,975
you could not give her
what she needed...

691
00:33:54,058 --> 00:33:55,435
what she deserved.

692
00:33:57,395 --> 00:33:59,063
I thought the same things...

693
00:33:59,147 --> 00:34:02,233
on the day I married
Mrs Ghoshdashtidar.

694
00:34:03,985 --> 00:34:05,069
May she rest.

695
00:34:06,863 --> 00:34:08,281
Did you?

696
00:34:08,364 --> 00:34:10,199
Yes. But guess what?

697
00:34:10,283 --> 00:34:13,369
It turned out
I was good enough.

698
00:34:13,453 --> 00:34:15,204
I made myself good enough.

699
00:34:16,831 --> 00:34:18,666
You did a stupid thing, Dennis.

700
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:23,504
But she loved you once, and you
must have earned that somehow.

701
00:34:26,883 --> 00:34:28,259
Yeah.

702
00:34:29,677 --> 00:34:32,638
Did you have a good marriage,
Mr Ghoshdashtidar?

703
00:34:32,722 --> 00:34:34,057
Ah.

704
00:34:36,184 --> 00:34:38,811
I remember the feeling
of being complete...

705
00:34:39,562 --> 00:34:44,108
of spending every day
with my best friend...

706
00:34:44,192 --> 00:34:45,610
but most of all...

707
00:34:48,112 --> 00:34:51,616
I remember all the fucking.

708
00:34:56,412 --> 00:34:57,830
Mmm...

709
00:34:59,707 --> 00:35:01,292
Mmm...

710
00:35:04,712 --> 00:35:06,923
Oh, three degrees starboard,
skipper.

711
00:35:07,006 --> 00:35:08,549
Hey, I'm the captain.

712
00:35:08,633 --> 00:35:11,511
Mutiny! Mutiny!

713
00:35:13,388 --> 00:35:14,806
Whoa!

714
00:35:14,889 --> 00:35:17,517
Ahoy there, me lad.

715
00:35:19,143 --> 00:35:20,937
- Oh!
- Hey, Jakey.

716
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,021
Sorry, we're late, love.

717
00:35:22,105 --> 00:35:23,689
Soon as Whit found out
we we're meeting here...

718
00:35:23,773 --> 00:35:25,233
he had to go get his vessel.

719
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,360
Jakey, here.
Flip that switch.

720
00:35:27,443 --> 00:35:29,612
No, not that one. That one.

721
00:35:32,573 --> 00:35:34,283
Whoa! Can I steer it?

722
00:35:34,367 --> 00:35:36,244
No.
But you can watch me steer it.

723
00:35:37,245 --> 00:35:38,329
Mutiny.

724
00:35:39,122 --> 00:35:40,540
Hey. You wanna?

725
00:35:43,626 --> 00:35:45,503
- Was he OK?
- Yeah, he's fine.

726
00:35:45,586 --> 00:35:49,048
We had a really nice time
until Captain Bligh turned up.

727
00:35:49,132 --> 00:35:51,217
Whit just likes to take things
very seriously.

728
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,886
Prepare to be boarded,
or feel the hot wrath...

729
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:56,597
of Her Majesty's
royal fusillade!

730
00:35:58,266 --> 00:35:59,559
Wait, don't touch that. Wait.

731
00:36:00,893 --> 00:36:02,353
Why won't you
let me steer it?

732
00:36:02,437 --> 00:36:04,230
Uh, because it's mine.

733
00:36:04,313 --> 00:36:05,690
So, you're still gonna run
in this marathon?

734
00:36:05,773 --> 00:36:06,899
Yes, absolutely.

735
00:36:06,983 --> 00:36:08,526
It's gonna be great.

736
00:36:08,609 --> 00:36:10,486
You're gonna see
a whole new Dennis.

737
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:11,904
Right, well,
I've been thinking about it...

738
00:36:11,988 --> 00:36:14,282
and the thing is, I don't care.

739
00:36:14,365 --> 00:36:15,616
What do you mean?

740
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,827
Dennis, what do you think
you're going to achieve?

741
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:20,121
Do you honestly think
that running 26 miles...

742
00:36:20,204 --> 00:36:21,748
is just gonna wipe
the slate clean?

743
00:36:21,831 --> 00:36:22,999
Well, you might change your mind
when you see me...

744
00:36:23,082 --> 00:36:24,167
in jogging shorts.

745
00:36:28,004 --> 00:36:30,673
Look, Whit's having
a birthday party...

746
00:36:30,757 --> 00:36:31,758
for me in a couple of weeks...

747
00:36:31,841 --> 00:36:34,594
and it would mean a lot to Jake
if you came.

748
00:36:34,677 --> 00:36:35,762
To Jake?

749
00:36:37,597 --> 00:36:38,681
Hey!

750
00:36:40,683 --> 00:36:41,768
Hey!

751
00:36:43,144 --> 00:36:44,520
Hey!

752
00:36:44,604 --> 00:36:45,605
Hey, OK.

753
00:36:45,688 --> 00:36:46,731
Whose boat is this?

754
00:36:46,814 --> 00:36:49,317
Whose boat...is this?!

755
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,403
Excuse me!
Is-- Is this your boat?!

756
00:36:53,905 --> 00:36:55,782
- No way!
- He's toast.

757
00:36:55,865 --> 00:36:56,949
He won't last.

758
00:37:02,914 --> 00:37:04,123
Would you like some pizza,
Dennis?

759
00:37:04,207 --> 00:37:06,167
Oh. Yes, I would actually.
Thank you very much.

760
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,251
- Ow!
- Come here.

761
00:37:07,335 --> 00:37:09,545
What are you doing that--
Stop it.

762
00:37:10,588 --> 00:37:11,589
Are you still gonna do this?

763
00:37:11,672 --> 00:37:12,840
Are you still gonna
run the marathon?

764
00:37:12,924 --> 00:37:14,008
I want to, yes.

765
00:37:14,092 --> 00:37:15,176
Thank God.

766
00:37:17,303 --> 00:37:18,304
Why?

767
00:37:18,388 --> 00:37:20,681
Because I just bet them
every penny I have.

768
00:37:20,765 --> 00:37:22,350
What? You bet on me?

769
00:37:23,142 --> 00:37:24,477
Dennis, you're my best friend.

770
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,396
I'm not gonna bet against you.

771
00:37:27,063 --> 00:37:28,481
Well, thank you.

772
00:37:28,564 --> 00:37:29,982
Not with these odds.

773
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:31,776
Well, what if I don't finish?

774
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:33,653
Vincent'll kill you.

775
00:37:33,736 --> 00:37:34,904
Oh, you'll finish.

776
00:37:34,987 --> 00:37:36,364
How can you be so sure?

777
00:37:40,368 --> 00:37:44,956
Get up, get up, get up, get up,
get up, get up, get up!

778
00:37:47,417 --> 00:37:49,293
So, you're gonna be my coach.

779
00:37:49,377 --> 00:37:50,795
That's right.

780
00:37:50,878 --> 00:37:51,879
Why are you here?

781
00:37:51,963 --> 00:37:54,298
I'm the assistant coach.

782
00:37:54,382 --> 00:37:55,425
Why do you get
to be assistant coach?

783
00:37:55,508 --> 00:37:57,135
Because I have this spatula.

784
00:37:57,218 --> 00:37:58,302
Ow!

785
00:37:59,971 --> 00:38:00,972
Go on. Get running.

786
00:38:01,055 --> 00:38:03,307
Wait. Isn't there some sort
of special technique?

787
00:38:04,475 --> 00:38:06,102
Yeah, you put one leg
in front of the other...

788
00:38:06,185 --> 00:38:08,271
over and over again really fast.

789
00:38:09,564 --> 00:38:10,690
Why are you here again?

790
00:38:10,773 --> 00:38:12,316
- Ow!
- Motivation.

791
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,068
# I said, yeah #

792
00:38:14,152 --> 00:38:15,528
# I said, yeah #

793
00:38:15,611 --> 00:38:18,197
- # What they said #
- # What they said #

794
00:38:18,281 --> 00:38:19,741
- # Oh, I said, yeah #
- Lift your knees higher!

795
00:38:19,824 --> 00:38:20,825
- You're not gonna get...
- # Yeah, yeah #

796
00:38:20,908 --> 00:38:22,577
- anywhere like that!
- # It's what they said #

797
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,537
- You've gotta slide more.
- # What they said #

798
00:38:25,163 --> 00:38:27,206
- # Do you believe I would
take something with me #
- Come on, Dennis!

799
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:29,250
- You want to feel my spatula?!
- # And give it #

800
00:38:29,333 --> 00:38:30,752
- No, I do not!
- # To the police man? #

801
00:38:30,835 --> 00:38:33,546
- Then run! Run like the wind!
- # I wouldn't do that #

802
00:38:34,172 --> 00:38:35,298
- # And if I do that #
- This is harder...

803
00:38:35,381 --> 00:38:37,175
- # I would say, "Sir" #
- for me, you know?

804
00:38:37,258 --> 00:38:38,718
# "Come on
and put the charge on me" #

805
00:38:38,801 --> 00:38:40,344
Ow!

806
00:38:40,428 --> 00:38:42,180
# I wouldn't do that #

807
00:38:42,263 --> 00:38:45,558
- # No, I wouldn't do that #
- Come on, Dennis! Come on!

808
00:38:45,641 --> 00:38:48,311
- Lookin' good! Lookin' good!
- # I'm not a fool
to hurt myself #

809
00:38:48,394 --> 00:38:49,937
- Come on, Dennis.
Keep up the pace.
- # I was innocent #

810
00:38:50,021 --> 00:38:52,231
- Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.
- # Of what they done to me #

811
00:38:52,315 --> 00:38:54,275
# They was wrong #

812
00:38:54,358 --> 00:38:55,359
I think I got a blister.

813
00:38:55,443 --> 00:38:56,486
- # They were wrong #
- OK.

814
00:38:56,569 --> 00:38:57,862
Yeah, gently.

815
00:38:57,945 --> 00:38:59,030
All right.

816
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:03,951
OK! Oh! All right.

817
00:39:04,035 --> 00:39:05,787
-ls it bad?
-No, it's not that bad.

818
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:07,455
No. No. It's not.

819
00:39:08,581 --> 00:39:10,917
Ohh! Oh, that's big.

820
00:39:13,419 --> 00:39:15,004
Look at that thing.

821
00:39:15,088 --> 00:39:16,631
It's like a womb.

822
00:39:17,298 --> 00:39:18,424
Don't.

823
00:39:18,508 --> 00:39:19,509
Hey, maybe there's a little man
in there...

824
00:39:19,592 --> 00:39:21,469
who looks just like you,
but he's really good at running.

825
00:39:21,552 --> 00:39:23,054
What are you talking about?!

826
00:39:23,137 --> 00:39:24,347
It's just a thought.

827
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:25,640
You're gonna have to pop it.

828
00:39:27,725 --> 00:39:29,143
No. No way.

829
00:39:29,227 --> 00:39:30,770
Never pop
another man's pustule.

830
00:39:30,853 --> 00:39:32,438
Well, I'll do it then.
Give me the needle.

831
00:39:32,522 --> 00:39:33,856
That's the closest I could get.

832
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:36,734
It's fine. I sterilized it.

833
00:39:36,818 --> 00:39:37,902
In what?

834
00:39:39,821 --> 00:39:41,197
It's sterilized.

835
00:39:42,657 --> 00:39:44,283
OK, OK. Here we go.

836
00:39:48,579 --> 00:39:49,705
Ooh, you're gonna get it.

837
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,500
Stick it in.

838
00:39:52,583 --> 00:39:53,793
- Pop it!
- I can't!

839
00:39:53,876 --> 00:39:55,378
- Why not?
- It's scary!

840
00:39:55,461 --> 00:39:56,754
Give it to me.

841
00:39:56,838 --> 00:39:57,839
Just do it slow!

842
00:39:57,922 --> 00:39:59,006
- Do it-- Do it gently, OK?
- Yeah.

843
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:00,633
- Trust me.
- After three, OK?

844
00:40:00,716 --> 00:40:01,884
- OK.
- One.

845
00:40:06,514 --> 00:40:07,598
It's in it!

846
00:40:08,182 --> 00:40:09,934
Get it out!

847
00:40:10,017 --> 00:40:11,561
Bloody take it out!

848
00:40:11,644 --> 00:40:13,062
- Hold still! Hold still!
- Get it!

849
00:40:21,154 --> 00:40:22,238
I'm so sorry.

850
00:40:23,072 --> 00:40:24,490
That's never happened before.

851
00:40:24,574 --> 00:40:25,992
Oh! Oh!

852
00:40:29,287 --> 00:40:30,455
I'm Catholic.

853
00:40:32,081 --> 00:40:33,583
That was the second
most disgusting fluid...

854
00:40:33,666 --> 00:40:34,959
I've ever had in my eye.

855
00:40:36,419 --> 00:40:37,628
Who's that?

856
00:40:37,712 --> 00:40:38,755
That's Mr G.

857
00:40:38,838 --> 00:40:40,590
Get something nice on,
something respectable.

858
00:40:40,673 --> 00:40:41,758
Where we goin'?

859
00:41:02,278 --> 00:41:04,405
Every year,
literally hundreds of people...

860
00:41:04,489 --> 00:41:07,950
are affected by acute
neurocortical emphasitis...

861
00:41:08,034 --> 00:41:09,911
or Hapsburg Syndrome.

862
00:41:09,994 --> 00:41:10,995
I see.

863
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:13,498
And how does the condition
manifest itself?

864
00:41:14,373 --> 00:41:15,416
The syndrome
is characterized...

865
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,293
by a loss
of lower body function...

866
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:21,881
sporadic and often violent
outbursts of profanity.

867
00:41:28,304 --> 00:41:30,306
And often chronic flatulence.

868
00:41:34,894 --> 00:41:36,604
It's our aim to raise awareness
of the condition...

869
00:41:36,687 --> 00:41:38,064
and, hopefully,
some funds to give...

870
00:41:38,147 --> 00:41:39,816
some much-needed support...

871
00:41:39,899 --> 00:41:41,943
to people such
as Mr Ghoshdashtidar here.

872
00:41:42,026 --> 00:41:43,319
Mmm...

873
00:41:46,656 --> 00:41:49,534
- Well, we think
that Mr Goshdashti--
- Ghosh!

874
00:41:49,617 --> 00:41:51,577
- Ghoshtashtidar--
- Ghosh! Ghosh!

875
00:41:51,661 --> 00:41:55,289
Ghoshtashtidar's condition
is very, uh, serious...

876
00:41:55,373 --> 00:41:59,043
and warrants support,
and we'd be delighted...

877
00:41:59,127 --> 00:42:03,881
for Mr Doyle to run
on behalf of acute neuro--

878
00:42:03,965 --> 00:42:05,216
Acute neurocortical emphasitis.

879
00:42:05,299 --> 00:42:06,801
- Or, uh...
- Hapsburg Syn--

880
00:42:06,884 --> 00:42:09,429
Syndrome awareness. Yes.

881
00:42:10,847 --> 00:42:11,931
OK.

882
00:42:14,058 --> 00:42:16,853
We'll just need the charity's
registration number.

883
00:42:17,645 --> 00:42:18,646
The what?

884
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:20,064
The registration number.

885
00:42:27,321 --> 00:42:28,865
Well, that couldn't
have gone any worse.

886
00:42:28,948 --> 00:42:30,658
Mmm.

887
00:42:30,742 --> 00:42:31,951
- Look out!
- Oh!

888
00:42:32,034 --> 00:42:33,327
Ohh!

889
00:42:33,411 --> 00:42:34,996
Aw, hit by a wheelchair.

890
00:42:36,789 --> 00:42:37,874
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

891
00:42:37,957 --> 00:42:38,958
- It stings.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

892
00:42:39,041 --> 00:42:40,042
- It stings.
- No, no, no, no!

893
00:42:40,126 --> 00:42:41,502
Dennis, don't touch him.

894
00:42:41,586 --> 00:42:42,587
- Can you stand?
- Oh, no!

895
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:44,922
- Are you OK?
- No. My leg's broken.

896
00:42:45,006 --> 00:42:46,132
We are so sorry.

897
00:42:46,215 --> 00:42:47,467
You-- Call an ambulance!

898
00:42:49,343 --> 00:42:50,344
Oh, this can't be happening.

899
00:42:50,428 --> 00:42:52,305
I was supposed to be running
the marathon in three weeks.

900
00:42:52,388 --> 00:42:53,514
- Really?
- Yeah.

901
00:42:53,598 --> 00:42:55,058
There were so many people
dependin' on me.

902
00:42:56,434 --> 00:42:57,560
Charity people?

903
00:42:57,643 --> 00:42:59,270
- Hmm?
- Yeah. God!

904
00:42:59,353 --> 00:43:01,397
What charity people?

905
00:43:01,481 --> 00:43:02,774
What do you think?

906
00:43:03,775 --> 00:43:04,859
Nice.

907
00:43:10,406 --> 00:43:11,407
Nicotine patch?

908
00:43:11,491 --> 00:43:12,492
Applied.

909
00:43:12,575 --> 00:43:14,827
- You been to the toilet?
- One and two.

910
00:43:15,703 --> 00:43:16,829
You ready?

911
00:43:18,331 --> 00:43:19,415
Ready.

912
00:43:42,647 --> 00:43:43,731
One.

913
00:43:45,316 --> 00:43:46,317
Ow.

914
00:43:46,401 --> 00:43:47,402
- Two.
- Get up there.

915
00:43:47,485 --> 00:43:49,612
# This is a jailbreak #

916
00:43:49,695 --> 00:43:51,823
# This is a Thursday afternoon #

917
00:43:51,906 --> 00:43:54,158
# But I didn't mean it #

918
00:43:54,242 --> 00:43:56,702
- # I didn't mean it #
- Ow!

919
00:43:56,786 --> 00:43:58,913
# I'd never get that far #

920
00:43:58,996 --> 00:44:01,207
# My baby,
short breath wouldn't do #

921
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:03,334
# But you took it serious #

922
00:44:03,418 --> 00:44:05,294
- # Took it so serious #
- Raise.

923
00:44:05,378 --> 00:44:06,879
- No!
- No!

924
00:44:08,589 --> 00:44:10,800
One, two...

925
00:44:20,184 --> 00:44:22,019
One more! One more!

926
00:44:24,188 --> 00:44:28,943
# Well, you accused me
of wearing movies in my eyes #

927
00:44:29,026 --> 00:44:31,154
# But I still love you #

928
00:44:31,237 --> 00:44:33,531
# Of course, I love you #

929
00:44:33,614 --> 00:44:35,533
# And so I countered #

930
00:44:35,616 --> 00:44:38,161
# You do the same, my Annie I #

931
00:44:38,244 --> 00:44:40,705
# You closed them so fast #

932
00:44:40,788 --> 00:44:45,460
# And you closed them so tight #

933
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,666
- Hi, Dennis.
- Wha--

934
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:28,503
I saw your friend Gordon
this morning.

935
00:45:28,586 --> 00:45:30,379
I will replace
anything he stole.

936
00:45:30,463 --> 00:45:32,298
He told me
about his little bet.

937
00:45:32,382 --> 00:45:33,383
Oh, yeah.

938
00:45:33,466 --> 00:45:35,259
- Yeah. Crazy, huh?
- Yeah.

939
00:45:35,343 --> 00:45:37,261
So I made a crazy little bet
of my own.

940
00:45:37,345 --> 00:45:39,180
Ooh. Who with?

941
00:45:39,263 --> 00:45:40,681
With you, silly.

942
00:45:40,765 --> 00:45:42,433
- We haven't made a bet.
- We're about to.

943
00:45:43,768 --> 00:45:45,228
Here it is.

944
00:45:45,311 --> 00:45:46,312
You finish the race...

945
00:45:46,396 --> 00:45:48,773
I'll forgive
all the back rent you owe.

946
00:45:48,856 --> 00:45:50,691
- And if I don't?
- If you don't finish...

947
00:45:50,775 --> 00:45:52,151
you pack your bags
and you leave.

948
00:45:52,235 --> 00:45:55,238
You go, and I finally get
some tidy tenants...

949
00:45:55,321 --> 00:45:56,948
who pay their rent on time.

950
00:45:57,031 --> 00:45:59,242
- Deal?
- No deal.

951
00:46:01,494 --> 00:46:03,371
Hey, what are you--
Hey, give me that.

952
00:46:03,454 --> 00:46:04,539
- Deal?
- Deal.

953
00:46:08,084 --> 00:46:10,044
- Maya, if you think making--
- Maya?

954
00:46:10,128 --> 00:46:11,587
Hey. Hello, Mr Ghoshdashtidar.

955
00:46:11,671 --> 00:46:13,172
How are you?

956
00:46:13,256 --> 00:46:15,466
I've got something for you.

957
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:17,552
Ooh. It's not the spatula,
is it?

958
00:46:17,635 --> 00:46:19,011
No.

959
00:46:24,726 --> 00:46:25,893
Wow.

960
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,480
To help you be a good man.

961
00:46:32,108 --> 00:46:33,192
I don't--

962
00:46:38,448 --> 00:46:39,532
Thank you.

963
00:46:40,324 --> 00:46:41,409
Wow.

964
00:46:46,706 --> 00:46:48,916
Peter Perfect, a perfect palace.

965
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,127
Try saying that
when you're smashed.

966
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:54,172
- I will.
- # Lately #

967
00:46:54,255 --> 00:46:58,551
# I been high-steppin' #

968
00:47:01,596 --> 00:47:02,722
# I've got a lover #

969
00:47:02,805 --> 00:47:06,100
- # Who just gets it for real #
- Hey. Hey, Dennis.

970
00:47:06,184 --> 00:47:07,894
- Hey.
- Glad you could make it.

971
00:47:07,977 --> 00:47:09,103
- Thank you.
- Oh, hey.

972
00:47:10,229 --> 00:47:12,106
Wow, Libby.

973
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:13,649
You look, um...wow.

974
00:47:13,733 --> 00:47:14,734
Thank you.

975
00:47:14,817 --> 00:47:16,402
I know, right?
Never mind all this.

976
00:47:16,486 --> 00:47:18,446
I'll take the view
I have right here.

977
00:47:18,529 --> 00:47:19,739
Oh.

978
00:47:22,492 --> 00:47:24,535
I'm Gordon, Libby's cousin.
Hello.

979
00:47:24,619 --> 00:47:26,412
Gordon. Of course.
I've heard a lot about you.

980
00:47:26,496 --> 00:47:27,955
Very nice to meet you.

981
00:47:28,039 --> 00:47:29,624
- Really?
- Yeah.

982
00:47:29,707 --> 00:47:31,501
Oh. I thought you said
he was an asshole.

983
00:47:32,293 --> 00:47:33,461
- Dennis!
- Gordon.

984
00:47:33,544 --> 00:47:35,129
- What?
- It's OK, Lib.

985
00:47:36,214 --> 00:47:37,757
Libby, I got you
a birthday present.

986
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,175
Oh.

987
00:47:39,258 --> 00:47:40,635
It's a CD.

988
00:47:40,718 --> 00:47:42,387
I hope you don't have it,
'cause I don't have a receipt...

989
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:44,430
and I didn't exactly
get it in a shop.

990
00:47:44,514 --> 00:47:46,265
Well, thank you, I think.

991
00:47:47,016 --> 00:47:48,476
It's OK. Where's the toilet?

992
00:47:51,104 --> 00:47:54,482
I'll show you, and, uh,
you can entertain Dennis.

993
00:47:54,565 --> 00:47:55,566
OK.

994
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:58,069
That is if he doesn't mind
hangin' out with an asshole.

995
00:47:59,529 --> 00:48:01,406
He was joking. I never
said you were an asshole.

996
00:48:01,489 --> 00:48:03,533
- Yeah, you did.
- Yeah, I did.

997
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:06,744
Whit seems nice.

998
00:48:06,828 --> 00:48:07,870
Yeah, he is.

999
00:48:07,954 --> 00:48:10,540
Good-looking, friendly,
well-off, steady job...

1000
00:48:10,623 --> 00:48:11,624
good with Jake...

1001
00:48:11,707 --> 00:48:13,292
just like you got him
out of a catalogue.

1002
00:48:13,376 --> 00:48:14,544
And what's your point?

1003
00:48:14,627 --> 00:48:17,088
I ordered a pair of shoes
once from a catalogue.

1004
00:48:17,171 --> 00:48:19,257
Gorgeous soft leather
ltalian loafers.

1005
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:20,550
They looked amazing,
but then they arrived...

1006
00:48:20,633 --> 00:48:22,760
and I put them on,
and they hurt like fuck.

1007
00:48:22,844 --> 00:48:24,137
Thanks. I'll bear that in mind.

1008
00:48:24,929 --> 00:48:26,472
Wow.

1009
00:48:26,556 --> 00:48:28,558
Hey, do you think it would
be weird if I took a bath?

1010
00:48:31,769 --> 00:48:33,563
Yeah, that would be weird.

1011
00:48:34,564 --> 00:48:36,274
- Hey.
- Hey.

1012
00:48:36,357 --> 00:48:37,859
- Here you go.
- Oh, thanks.

1013
00:48:37,942 --> 00:48:39,235
Cheers.

1014
00:48:39,318 --> 00:48:40,403
Cheers.

1015
00:48:42,739 --> 00:48:44,157
What do you think?

1016
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,325
I think I see a guy
peeing on your car.

1017
00:48:46,409 --> 00:48:47,493
- What?
- Got you.

1018
00:48:48,619 --> 00:48:50,705
Oh, very good.

1019
00:48:50,788 --> 00:48:52,790
Actually, you see that?

1020
00:48:52,874 --> 00:48:53,875
What?

1021
00:48:53,958 --> 00:48:55,668
There. I'm talking
about St. Paul's Cathedral.

1022
00:48:55,752 --> 00:48:57,086
- You see it?
- Uh-huh.

1023
00:48:57,170 --> 00:48:58,796
Currently my favourite spot
in London.

1024
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,048
You know why?

1025
00:49:00,131 --> 00:49:02,258
Uh, is it because that's
where you first realized...

1026
00:49:02,341 --> 00:49:03,551
how amazing you are?

1027
00:49:05,553 --> 00:49:06,971
It's the finish line
for the marathon.

1028
00:49:07,972 --> 00:49:09,182
Only two more days,
and I get to cross it.

1029
00:49:09,265 --> 00:49:10,266
Can't wait.

1030
00:49:10,349 --> 00:49:11,893
Me, too.

1031
00:49:11,976 --> 00:49:14,103
Greatest feeling in the world,
finishing a distance race.

1032
00:49:14,187 --> 00:49:16,439
I think you're really
gonna get a kick out of it.

1033
00:49:16,522 --> 00:49:17,774
You don't think
I'm gonna finish, do you?

1034
00:49:17,857 --> 00:49:18,900
No, I don't.

1035
00:49:18,983 --> 00:49:19,984
Why not?

1036
00:49:20,068 --> 00:49:21,861
'Cause it's really hard, Dennis.

1037
00:49:21,944 --> 00:49:23,279
Actually requires
a couple of things...

1038
00:49:23,362 --> 00:49:26,282
that, uh, forgive me,
but you don't seem to possess.

1039
00:49:26,365 --> 00:49:27,658
I happen to have
a very nice pair...

1040
00:49:27,742 --> 00:49:29,368
of running shoes now,
thank you very much.

1041
00:49:30,912 --> 00:49:33,706
I'm talking about discipline
and perseverance.

1042
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:36,000
And all cute
little comments aside...

1043
00:49:36,751 --> 00:49:38,086
there comes a point
in every race--

1044
00:49:38,169 --> 00:49:39,962
it could be the fifth mile,
it could be the 25th--

1045
00:49:40,046 --> 00:49:41,547
but, eventually,
you're gonna hit...

1046
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:43,508
what runners like to call
"the wall."

1047
00:49:43,591 --> 00:49:44,926
And when you do...

1048
00:49:45,009 --> 00:49:47,720
you won't be able to breathe
or think or even move.

1049
00:49:47,804 --> 00:49:49,931
All you're gonna wanna do
is give up.

1050
00:49:50,014 --> 00:49:51,516
And I have
a very strong feeling...

1051
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:53,810
that that's exactly
what you're gonna do, Dennis.

1052
00:49:54,519 --> 00:49:55,520
See, that's the difference...

1053
00:49:55,603 --> 00:49:57,980
between getting a girl
like Libby...

1054
00:49:58,064 --> 00:49:59,524
and keeping a girl like Libby.

1055
00:50:05,279 --> 00:50:06,447
You good?
You need anything else?

1056
00:50:06,531 --> 00:50:08,616
- No, I'm good.
- OK.

1057
00:50:15,873 --> 00:50:20,128
# Love is sweet, they say #

1058
00:50:22,046 --> 00:50:27,051
# Promises of tomorrow #

1059
00:50:28,219 --> 00:50:35,184
# But the tighter you grip,
the faster you slip #

1060
00:50:35,268 --> 00:50:39,021
# This much I know #

1061
00:50:40,481 --> 00:50:43,568
# Lately, I want everyhing #

1062
00:50:43,651 --> 00:50:46,446
# Every star tied to a string #

1063
00:50:46,529 --> 00:50:49,490
# Coffee, tea, and in between #

1064
00:50:49,574 --> 00:50:52,535
# The sweetest smile
I've ever seen #

1065
00:50:52,618 --> 00:50:56,164
# A different song
in every room... #

1066
00:50:56,247 --> 00:50:58,458
- Oh, shit! Sorry. Sorry.
- That's OK.

1067
00:50:58,541 --> 00:51:00,376
- No, it's OK. It's OK.
- Oh, man. It's just--

1068
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:02,044
It's just soda water, honestly.

1069
00:51:02,128 --> 00:51:03,379
Should I not rub
your boob, then?

1070
00:51:04,422 --> 00:51:05,965
- Yeah.
- OK. Sorry.

1071
00:51:06,049 --> 00:51:07,133
I can do the other one,
you know?

1072
00:51:07,216 --> 00:51:09,260
'Cause I'm here, I might as well
just even it out.

1073
00:51:09,343 --> 00:51:10,428
Sorry.

1074
00:51:13,222 --> 00:51:14,724
So, you havin' a...
havin' a good time?

1075
00:51:15,558 --> 00:51:18,061
Yeah. Yes, I am, thank you.

1076
00:51:21,647 --> 00:51:22,815
You've lost weight.

1077
00:51:22,899 --> 00:51:24,192
Yeah, just a little bit.

1078
00:51:24,275 --> 00:51:25,276
Yeah.

1079
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:26,819
You know, get on.

1080
00:51:26,903 --> 00:51:29,989
Where's Jake?
I thought he was gonna be here.

1081
00:51:30,073 --> 00:51:31,365
Uh, no.

1082
00:51:31,449 --> 00:51:32,992
Whit thought that we'd have
a better time...

1083
00:51:33,076 --> 00:51:34,994
if we got a sitter.

1084
00:51:35,078 --> 00:51:37,455
Oh. What did you think?

1085
00:51:41,959 --> 00:51:43,503
I should get back.

1086
00:51:43,586 --> 00:51:46,464
Libby, um,
I never actually thanked you.

1087
00:51:48,174 --> 00:51:49,175
For what?

1088
00:51:49,258 --> 00:51:52,845
Well, for just sort of
lettin' me back into your life.

1089
00:51:52,929 --> 00:51:54,597
Jake's life.

1090
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,057
Yeah, well, you know.

1091
00:51:57,558 --> 00:51:58,684
I mean, l-I wouldn't have
been surprised...

1092
00:51:58,768 --> 00:52:00,645
if you just cut me off
completely, you know?

1093
00:52:00,728 --> 00:52:02,105
Ugh, now you tell me.

1094
00:52:03,523 --> 00:52:04,982
Well, no, I mean--

1095
00:52:05,066 --> 00:52:06,317
No, he needs his dad.

1096
00:52:07,652 --> 00:52:08,736
Yeah.

1097
00:52:10,696 --> 00:52:14,617
You were right, you know,
about me enterin' the marathon.

1098
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,869
It-- You know,
it was because I was...

1099
00:52:16,953 --> 00:52:18,871
sort of trying to win you back
kind of thing.

1100
00:52:18,955 --> 00:52:21,416
And I'd always kinda hoped
that maybe, we'd, you know...

1101
00:52:21,499 --> 00:52:22,667
get back together and that...

1102
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:25,461
but, you know,
when I saw you with Whit--

1103
00:52:26,337 --> 00:52:27,714
- Dennis.
- I know-- I know-- I know--

1104
00:52:27,797 --> 00:52:30,883
I know it's the height
of hypocrisy, and I know--

1105
00:52:30,967 --> 00:52:32,427
I know doin' this
isn't gonna change anything...

1106
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:34,929
or--or make anything better,
but, um...

1107
00:52:37,473 --> 00:52:39,475
I'd just--
I'd settle for your respect.

1108
00:52:42,019 --> 00:52:43,229
You know,
I'd settle for you smiling...

1109
00:52:43,312 --> 00:52:45,773
when you thought about the time
that we had together...

1110
00:52:45,857 --> 00:52:47,984
and not thinkin'
it was a waste of time.

1111
00:52:50,236 --> 00:52:51,279
You know, I mean, I know...

1112
00:52:51,362 --> 00:52:54,615
I didn't do you any favours
on that day, OK?

1113
00:52:54,699 --> 00:52:57,535
I did a stupid, stupid thing.

1114
00:52:57,618 --> 00:53:00,621
But it was
only because I thought...

1115
00:53:00,705 --> 00:53:03,416
spoiling your day was better
than ruining your life.

1116
00:53:05,501 --> 00:53:07,295
Does that make any sense?

1117
00:53:11,132 --> 00:53:12,467
You're such an idiot.

1118
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:19,265
Hey, I got you something.

1119
00:53:19,348 --> 00:53:21,017
Oh, what is it?

1120
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:23,227
It's something
I think you don't have.

1121
00:53:23,311 --> 00:53:25,021
A history
of reliable boyfriends?

1122
00:53:26,689 --> 00:53:28,941
No, it's--
Well, it's only, you know...

1123
00:53:29,025 --> 00:53:30,151
- Open it later on.
- OK.

1124
00:53:30,234 --> 00:53:31,861
Happy birthday.

1125
00:53:31,944 --> 00:53:33,362
- Thank you.
- No.

1126
00:53:36,866 --> 00:53:37,950
Oh.

1127
00:53:57,095 --> 00:53:59,305
- Everyone, could I have
your attention?
- Oh, my God.

1128
00:53:59,389 --> 00:54:03,267
Hey. Everyone,
your attention, please.

1129
00:54:03,351 --> 00:54:05,520
Everyone, hi.

1130
00:54:05,603 --> 00:54:06,604
Thank you for coming.

1131
00:54:06,687 --> 00:54:08,231
- Really good to see you all.
- Thank you.

1132
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:10,733
As you all know,
we're here to celebrate...

1133
00:54:10,817 --> 00:54:14,570
the birthday
of one Elizabeth Olivia O'Dell.

1134
00:54:16,697 --> 00:54:18,908
Happy birthday.

1135
00:54:18,991 --> 00:54:22,537
As many of you know, uh,
my passion in life is running.

1136
00:54:23,538 --> 00:54:24,872
In fact,
in a couple of days...

1137
00:54:24,956 --> 00:54:27,458
I'll be completing another
marathon, thank you very much.

1138
00:54:30,586 --> 00:54:33,756
Uh, now, success in running
requires a lot...

1139
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,467
of the same things
as success in love--

1140
00:54:36,551 --> 00:54:39,053
passion, determination...

1141
00:54:39,137 --> 00:54:41,889
and something I've needed
a lot of with Libby, stamina.

1142
00:54:45,518 --> 00:54:47,103
That's just inappropriate,
isn't it?

1143
00:54:47,186 --> 00:54:48,521
The long-winded point
I'm trying to make...

1144
00:54:48,604 --> 00:54:52,275
is that both love and running
require heart...

1145
00:54:52,358 --> 00:54:54,485
and Libby has...
truly, has more heart...

1146
00:54:54,569 --> 00:54:56,487
than any other person
I've ever known.

1147
00:54:56,571 --> 00:54:59,240
So happy birthday, sweetie.

1148
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,535
Thank you all.

1149
00:55:07,582 --> 00:55:09,417
Oh, trainers!

1150
00:55:10,251 --> 00:55:12,962
I'm sorry. Can l, uh,
just see this for a second?

1151
00:55:13,046 --> 00:55:15,715
Now, what, um...
As most of you know...

1152
00:55:15,798 --> 00:55:18,926
I usually run my races alone,
but I thought...

1153
00:55:20,553 --> 00:55:22,972
I was wondering
if you would consider...

1154
00:55:23,056 --> 00:55:24,390
becoming my partner?

1155
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:31,814
Oh, my.

1156
00:55:33,232 --> 00:55:36,152
Libby, will you marry me?

1157
00:55:49,207 --> 00:55:50,875
No, no, no, no.

1158
00:55:52,251 --> 00:55:53,544
OK. Yes.

1159
00:55:53,628 --> 00:55:55,213
- Yes?
- Yeah.

1160
00:56:10,603 --> 00:56:11,854
So beautiful.

1161
00:56:12,897 --> 00:56:14,357
Just beautiful.

1162
00:56:15,149 --> 00:56:16,234
Thank you.

1163
00:56:17,652 --> 00:56:18,820
Thank you, everybody.

1164
00:56:21,447 --> 00:56:22,532
Crazy.

1165
00:56:23,574 --> 00:56:24,659
What'd I miss?

1166
00:56:28,246 --> 00:56:29,330
So...

1167
00:56:31,249 --> 00:56:33,709
You bloody...poison.

1168
00:56:35,211 --> 00:56:38,589
All right. You can stick it
up your ass...

1169
00:56:38,673 --> 00:56:41,384
you big American prick.

1170
00:56:42,427 --> 00:56:44,679
# Our love has changed #

1171
00:56:47,682 --> 00:56:50,476
- I don't mind they've decided.
- # It's not the same #

1172
00:56:53,104 --> 00:56:55,898
# And the only way to say it #

1173
00:56:57,859 --> 00:56:59,694
# Is say it #

1174
00:57:01,237 --> 00:57:02,780
# It's better #

1175
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:08,035
# I can't concede #

1176
00:57:12,165 --> 00:57:14,709
# This way I feel #

1177
00:57:17,128 --> 00:57:19,839
# For all the time
we spend together #

1178
00:57:22,091 --> 00:57:26,679
# Forever just gets better #

1179
00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:32,560
# See, what I'm trying
to say is #

1180
00:57:34,145 --> 00:57:38,691
# You make things better #

1181
00:57:41,235 --> 00:57:45,073
# And no matter
what the day is #

1182
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:50,953
# With you here, it's better #

1183
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:56,709
# I'll stand by you #

1184
00:58:00,671 --> 00:58:03,383
# If you stand by me #

1185
00:58:05,468 --> 00:58:08,971
# I think it's time
that I reveal it #

1186
00:58:10,181 --> 00:58:12,308
# 'Cause I believe it #

1187
00:58:13,643 --> 00:58:15,853
# It's better #

1188
00:58:18,064 --> 00:58:21,484
# See, what I'm tryin'
to say is #

1189
00:58:22,777 --> 00:58:27,615
# You make things better #

1190
00:58:38,418 --> 00:58:39,711
Dennis!

1191
00:58:42,296 --> 00:58:44,132
So what do you think
we should do, Dennis?

1192
00:58:45,508 --> 00:58:48,594
Jake got really upset when
I tried to explain it to him.

1193
00:58:48,678 --> 00:58:53,099
So, I just wonder whether maybe
you could talk to him today?

1194
00:58:58,229 --> 00:58:59,522
You know, just--
If he heard it from you...

1195
00:58:59,605 --> 00:59:02,275
that you're always gonna be
his daddy, you know?

1196
00:59:02,358 --> 00:59:04,152
I take it the diet's off.

1197
00:59:06,738 --> 00:59:08,614
Dennis, are you even listening?

1198
00:59:08,698 --> 00:59:09,741
Dennis!

1199
00:59:09,824 --> 00:59:11,409
What? You want--
You want me to tell Jake...

1200
00:59:11,492 --> 00:59:13,745
what a--what a--
what a perfect guy Whit is...

1201
00:59:13,828 --> 00:59:15,163
and it's all gonna be
really perfect...

1202
00:59:15,246 --> 00:59:16,789
in his new perfect life?

1203
00:59:16,873 --> 00:59:19,250
No.
Not necessarily in those words.

1204
00:59:19,333 --> 00:59:21,836
I cannot believe
you're gonna marry this guy.

1205
00:59:21,919 --> 00:59:24,088
He pulled your engagement ring
out of a shoe.

1206
00:59:24,172 --> 00:59:26,049
Please, Dennis,
you're the only one...

1207
00:59:26,132 --> 00:59:28,259
who can help Jake
feel OK about this.

1208
00:59:28,342 --> 00:59:30,553
Listen, if you wanna marry Whit,
that's fine, OK?

1209
00:59:30,636 --> 00:59:32,638
You're a big girl, and you can
make your own mistakes, OK?

1210
00:59:32,722 --> 00:59:34,265
But don't come down here
while I'm eating...

1211
00:59:34,348 --> 00:59:36,392
my full English breakfast
with extra breakfast...

1212
00:59:36,476 --> 00:59:38,227
and expect me to make things
easier for you, OK?

1213
00:59:38,311 --> 00:59:40,146
Can I please get
some ketchup here?!

1214
00:59:42,273 --> 00:59:43,608
I'm not gonna run.

1215
00:59:43,691 --> 00:59:44,692
What?!

1216
00:59:44,776 --> 00:59:46,277
I said I'm not running.

1217
00:59:51,532 --> 00:59:52,992
What do you mean,
you're not running?

1218
00:59:53,076 --> 00:59:55,244
I mean, I'm not running. I'm
not running a stupid marathon.

1219
00:59:56,037 --> 00:59:57,580
Why? Because Libby's
getting married again?

1220
00:59:57,663 --> 00:59:58,664
What did you think?

1221
00:59:58,748 --> 01:00:00,208
She-- She's not gonna find
anybody better than you?

1222
01:00:00,291 --> 01:00:01,376
Well, let me be the first
to tell you.

1223
01:00:01,459 --> 01:00:03,044
You know, you're
not a tough act to follow.

1224
01:00:03,127 --> 01:00:04,670
Oh, what?
You think I don't know that?

1225
01:00:04,754 --> 01:00:06,839
I don't care any more!

1226
01:00:07,548 --> 01:00:09,175
- What about me?
- What about you?

1227
01:00:09,258 --> 01:00:11,052
I've got money on this!
A lot of money!

1228
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:12,762
That is not my problem!

1229
01:00:13,971 --> 01:00:15,056
Quit it!

1230
01:00:15,139 --> 01:00:16,349
I'm not the quitter.

1231
01:00:23,064 --> 01:00:24,649
- Let me go!
- Ow, my ear!

1232
01:00:24,732 --> 01:00:26,067
- Let go!
- Ow!

1233
01:00:36,786 --> 01:00:37,870
Oh, OK! Oh, all right!

1234
01:00:37,954 --> 01:00:41,499
Oh, enough!
Just-- Just stop for a minute!

1235
01:00:51,592 --> 01:00:53,469
# Every day,
I love you less and less #

1236
01:00:54,762 --> 01:00:57,306
# I've got to get this feeling
off my chest #

1237
01:00:57,390 --> 01:00:59,767
# The doctor says
all I need's pills and rest #

1238
01:01:00,226 --> 01:01:02,311
# Since every day,
I love you less and less #

1239
01:01:02,395 --> 01:01:04,063
# Unless, unless #

1240
01:01:04,147 --> 01:01:05,398
- # I know, I feel it #
- Are you gonna run?

1241
01:01:05,481 --> 01:01:06,482
# In my bones #
- No!

1242
01:01:06,566 --> 01:01:07,817
# I'm sick, I'm tired #

1243
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:09,110
# Of staying in control #

1244
01:01:09,193 --> 01:01:12,488
- # Oh, yes, I feel
I race upon a wheel #
- Oh, God!

1245
01:01:12,572 --> 01:01:15,199
- OK, OK, OK, OK.
- You'll run?

1246
01:01:15,283 --> 01:01:16,868
# Oh, yes, I'm stressed #

1247
01:01:16,951 --> 01:01:18,327
# I'm sorry I digressed #

1248
01:01:18,411 --> 01:01:21,164
# lmpressed,
you're dressed to SOS #

1249
01:01:21,247 --> 01:01:23,207
# Oh-oh #

1250
01:01:23,291 --> 01:01:25,918
- My balls!
- # And my parents love me #

1251
01:01:26,002 --> 01:01:29,172
# Oh-oh #

1252
01:01:29,255 --> 01:01:32,050
- # And my girlfriend loves me #
- That's it! Run away!

1253
01:01:32,133 --> 01:01:33,718
That's what you always do!

1254
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:36,179
Run away!

1255
01:01:38,014 --> 01:01:39,891
# Every day,
I love you less and less #

1256
01:01:44,228 --> 01:01:45,813
Hey, what the--

1257
01:01:46,647 --> 01:01:48,357
- Hello, Dennis.
- What are you doing?

1258
01:01:48,441 --> 01:01:49,442
Gordon called.

1259
01:01:49,525 --> 01:01:51,569
He tells me
you're not running the marathon.

1260
01:01:51,652 --> 01:01:53,112
- Yeah, but--
- But, what?

1261
01:01:53,196 --> 01:01:54,530
Are you running or not?

1262
01:01:54,614 --> 01:01:55,615
- No, but--
- So there you go.

1263
01:01:55,698 --> 01:01:56,908
- Wait--
- Sorry, Dennis.

1264
01:01:56,991 --> 01:01:58,618
A bet's a bet. You're out.

1265
01:01:59,285 --> 01:02:01,788
Mr Ghoshdashtidar?
Mr Ghoshdashtidar!

1266
01:02:01,871 --> 01:02:03,247
- Who the hell are you?
- Oh, please, look.

1267
01:02:03,331 --> 01:02:05,833
- I thought you were
a good man, Dennis.
- Yeah...

1268
01:02:05,917 --> 01:02:09,212
A little screwed up here
in the head, OK.

1269
01:02:09,295 --> 01:02:11,339
But Maya was right about you.
You are no good.

1270
01:02:11,422 --> 01:02:12,924
- Look--
- Always running away...

1271
01:02:13,007 --> 01:02:14,509
never running
in the right direction.

1272
01:02:14,592 --> 01:02:15,593
Yeah, but, oh--

1273
01:02:15,676 --> 01:02:18,304
I bought you
new running shoes, Dennis.

1274
01:02:18,388 --> 01:02:20,932
The man said
they were the best you can buy.

1275
01:02:21,015 --> 01:02:22,850
- Yes, but--
- "But, but, but!"

1276
01:02:22,934 --> 01:02:26,062
Always "but"!
Always excuses with you!

1277
01:02:26,145 --> 01:02:28,940
Always some reason
why it's not your fault!

1278
01:02:29,023 --> 01:02:32,610
I have news for you,
Dennis Doyle from downstairs.

1279
01:02:33,319 --> 01:02:35,321
It's all your fault!

1280
01:02:49,627 --> 01:02:50,920
- Hi.
- Hi.

1281
01:02:52,463 --> 01:02:54,215
You-- You havin' a yard sale?

1282
01:02:55,049 --> 01:02:57,176
No. Where's Libby?

1283
01:02:57,260 --> 01:02:58,761
Uh, she's pickin' up Jake.

1284
01:02:58,845 --> 01:03:02,432
I suppose, uh,
congratulations are in order.

1285
01:03:02,515 --> 01:03:05,309
Oh, yeah. Well, thank you.

1286
01:03:06,978 --> 01:03:08,062
Best man won.

1287
01:03:09,147 --> 01:03:12,066
Well, I wasn't really aware
it was a contest.

1288
01:03:13,985 --> 01:03:16,362
Dennis! Dennis!
Is Jake with you?

1289
01:03:16,446 --> 01:03:17,447
No, why? I--

1290
01:03:17,530 --> 01:03:18,823
Well, is he here, Whit?

1291
01:03:18,906 --> 01:03:20,116
- I thought you were
picking him up.
- Jake!

1292
01:03:20,199 --> 01:03:21,200
- Libby?
- Jake!

1293
01:03:21,284 --> 01:03:22,410
Libby, what is--

1294
01:03:22,493 --> 01:03:23,911
- What did you say to him?!
- l-- What are you--

1295
01:03:23,995 --> 01:03:25,204
I didn't say anything.
What do you mean?

1296
01:03:25,288 --> 01:03:26,497
Well, he was at Emily's
and something happened.

1297
01:03:26,581 --> 01:03:27,665
He just ran out.

1298
01:03:27,749 --> 01:03:30,001
- What?
- He has run away, OK?

1299
01:03:30,084 --> 01:03:31,502
Jake ran away!

1300
01:03:36,257 --> 01:03:37,341
Jake!

1301
01:03:38,885 --> 01:03:39,969
Jake!

1302
01:03:42,430 --> 01:03:43,514
Gordon!

1303
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:45,224
Gordon!

1304
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:48,186
- Yes?
- Jake's run away.

1305
01:03:48,269 --> 01:03:50,188
- What?
- He's run away!

1306
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:51,272
All right.
Well, wait a minute.

1307
01:03:51,355 --> 01:03:53,191
Just calm down.
Think for a second.

1308
01:03:53,274 --> 01:03:54,484
Where would he go?

1309
01:04:36,526 --> 01:04:38,111
Hiya, snot-face.

1310
01:04:57,755 --> 01:04:59,006
Yeah, he's fine.

1311
01:05:00,049 --> 01:05:02,343
We'll be back in about
a half an hour, I guess.

1312
01:05:02,427 --> 01:05:03,678
OK.

1313
01:05:06,097 --> 01:05:07,390
Is she mad at me?

1314
01:05:07,473 --> 01:05:09,267
No, no.
She's just glad you're OK.

1315
01:05:13,229 --> 01:05:14,856
Do you wanna tell me
what happened?

1316
01:05:14,939 --> 01:05:17,859
Emily doesn't wanna be
my girlfriend any more.

1317
01:05:17,942 --> 01:05:19,110
Why not?

1318
01:05:19,193 --> 01:05:21,446
'Cause there's this other boy,
Robert...

1319
01:05:21,529 --> 01:05:23,156
and he's got a ponytail...

1320
01:05:23,239 --> 01:05:25,324
and she likes him now.

1321
01:05:25,408 --> 01:05:27,326
What, she likes him
because he's got a ponytail?

1322
01:05:27,410 --> 01:05:29,036
Uh-huh.

1323
01:05:31,164 --> 01:05:32,498
Jake 'n Bake...

1324
01:05:32,582 --> 01:05:33,875
as you get older,
you're gonna realize...

1325
01:05:33,958 --> 01:05:36,252
there are a lot of things
that you don't like, OK?

1326
01:05:36,335 --> 01:05:38,671
Things much worse than this.

1327
01:05:38,755 --> 01:05:41,049
And when those things happen,
you can't just run away.

1328
01:05:41,132 --> 01:05:43,051
Why not?

1329
01:05:43,134 --> 01:05:45,470
Because it doesn't solve
the problem.

1330
01:05:45,553 --> 01:05:46,596
You know,
when you start running...

1331
01:05:46,679 --> 01:05:47,680
the problem's still there.

1332
01:05:47,764 --> 01:05:50,391
You've got to stick at it,
and then figure out a way...

1333
01:05:50,475 --> 01:05:53,519
to solve the problem, even if
it's really, really hard.

1334
01:05:53,603 --> 01:05:55,563
Is that what you do, Dad?

1335
01:05:59,317 --> 01:06:00,568
Dad?

1336
01:06:03,279 --> 01:06:04,363
Dennis!

1337
01:06:05,490 --> 01:06:06,741
Dennis!

1338
01:06:06,824 --> 01:06:07,909
Gordon!

1339
01:06:10,745 --> 01:06:11,829
Gordon!

1340
01:06:13,998 --> 01:06:15,666
- Found him?
- Yes.

1341
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:17,585
Good. You can't stay here.

1342
01:06:18,378 --> 01:06:19,379
Gordon!

1343
01:06:19,462 --> 01:06:20,463
What?!

1344
01:06:20,546 --> 01:06:22,382
I'm running.

1345
01:06:23,883 --> 01:06:25,259
Well, come on up then.

1346
01:06:27,512 --> 01:06:29,639
Wow, these are great.
Where'd you get 'em?

1347
01:06:29,722 --> 01:06:31,182
- Whit's place.
- Thanks.

1348
01:06:31,265 --> 01:06:32,392
See, the trick is...

1349
01:06:32,475 --> 01:06:34,852
you got to load up on carbs
the night before the race.

1350
01:06:34,936 --> 01:06:35,937
I read it in Cosmo.

1351
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:37,063
How are the legs? Not too tight?

1352
01:06:37,146 --> 01:06:38,648
No. No, they're fine.

1353
01:06:38,731 --> 01:06:39,899
Have you got everyhing
you need?

1354
01:06:39,982 --> 01:06:42,402
You know, your shoes,
your shorts, penis t-shirt?

1355
01:06:42,485 --> 01:06:44,320
- Yes.
- Oh.

1356
01:06:52,245 --> 01:06:53,704
I'm not really in the mood.

1357
01:06:53,788 --> 01:06:55,331
- It's for your nipples.
- What?

1358
01:06:55,415 --> 01:06:57,917
You run a 26-mile race,
a lot of friction...

1359
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,377
is generated from your shirt
to your nipples.

1360
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:00,753
And the last thing you want
during a marathon...

1361
01:07:00,837 --> 01:07:01,838
is nipple chafing.

1362
01:07:01,921 --> 01:07:03,172
- Cosmo?
- Yeah.

1363
01:07:03,256 --> 01:07:04,507
I'm not puttin' that
on my nipples, OK?

1364
01:07:04,590 --> 01:07:06,551
And I'm not gonna eat this.
Let's just go to sleep.

1365
01:07:06,634 --> 01:07:08,261
Well, at least,
let me make your bed for you.

1366
01:07:11,597 --> 01:07:12,598
Anything else?

1367
01:07:12,682 --> 01:07:13,808
Have you got a pillow?

1368
01:07:13,891 --> 01:07:16,144
- No.
- Well, then I guess I'm fine.

1369
01:07:20,815 --> 01:07:22,817
Hey, what time
do you have to be up tomorrow?

1370
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:25,987
Well, we should set the alarm
for about seven o'clock.

1371
01:07:26,070 --> 01:07:27,739
- I don't have an alarm clock.
- Why not?

1372
01:07:27,822 --> 01:07:29,741
I never need to be anywhere.

1373
01:07:34,287 --> 01:07:35,663
The race starts at 9.00, OK?

1374
01:07:35,747 --> 01:07:38,833
So we should leave here
no later than 8.00, OK?

1375
01:07:38,916 --> 01:07:40,168
OK.

1376
01:07:42,378 --> 01:07:43,546
Night.

1377
01:07:43,629 --> 01:07:44,714
Love you.

1378
01:07:51,637 --> 01:07:52,638
A very good morning to you.

1379
01:07:52,722 --> 01:07:54,599
It's a beautiful day
here in London...

1380
01:07:54,682 --> 01:07:56,684
for the first
annual Nike River Run.

1381
01:07:56,768 --> 01:07:59,062
We've had a very warm welcome
from the crowd...

1382
01:07:59,145 --> 01:08:00,855
and we've got perfect conditions
for this race, Denise.

1383
01:08:00,938 --> 01:08:02,398
We certainly have.

1384
01:08:02,482 --> 01:08:04,734
26.2 miles
along the River Thames...

1385
01:08:04,817 --> 01:08:06,944
10,000 runners
from all over the globe...

1386
01:08:07,028 --> 01:08:08,946
and an amazing way
for many of these folks...

1387
01:08:09,030 --> 01:08:11,657
to raise money for so many
worthwhile charities.

1388
01:08:11,741 --> 01:08:13,034
And as we can see,
race officials...

1389
01:08:13,117 --> 01:08:15,078
are already busy
at the starting line...

1390
01:08:15,161 --> 01:08:17,747
with the start
less than an hour away.

1391
01:08:24,003 --> 01:08:25,838
- Taxi!
- # Keep on runnin' #

1392
01:08:25,922 --> 01:08:27,298
Taxi!

1393
01:08:27,382 --> 01:08:30,259
- # Keep on hidin' #
- Taxi!

1394
01:08:30,343 --> 01:08:31,344
Wait!

1395
01:08:31,427 --> 01:08:32,428
- Wait!
- # One fine day #

1396
01:08:32,512 --> 01:08:33,763
# I'm gonna be the one #

1397
01:08:33,846 --> 01:08:35,598
# To make you understand #

1398
01:08:35,681 --> 01:08:36,974
- It's a wonderful course.
- # Oh, yeah #

1399
01:08:37,058 --> 01:08:39,435
- They'll wind
around the Thames...
- # I'm gonna be your man #

1400
01:08:40,228 --> 01:08:43,064
They'll cross over five bridges,
including Osney Bridge...

1401
01:08:43,147 --> 01:08:44,607
Albert Bridge,
and the Millennium Bridge.

1402
01:08:44,690 --> 01:08:46,567
OK, OK. So go at your
own pace today, all right?

1403
01:08:46,651 --> 01:08:48,611
- Slow and steady.
- OK. Slow and steady.

1404
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:51,989
Yeah, they're challenging
the leaders we have here.

1405
01:08:52,073 --> 01:08:54,659
One from Japan,
Hiyusha Shinuzu...

1406
01:08:54,742 --> 01:08:57,328
and, of course, up there also,
is Sumi Yamata.

1407
01:08:58,788 --> 01:08:59,872
Watch it!

1408
01:09:00,707 --> 01:09:02,458
- ldiot!
- # Keep on runnin' #

1409
01:09:04,293 --> 01:09:05,294
- # Runnin' from #
- The other way! Go back!

1410
01:09:05,378 --> 01:09:06,879
- # My heart #
- No, we're not goin' back!

1411
01:09:06,963 --> 01:09:08,798
Amongst the names
we should keep an eye on...

1412
01:09:08,881 --> 01:09:10,007
are the men from Kenya.

1413
01:09:10,091 --> 01:09:13,594
Always so strong, Wilson Deetay
and Collington Degwa...

1414
01:09:13,678 --> 01:09:16,556
they always can be found
at front of the pack.

1415
01:09:20,601 --> 01:09:21,602
This is as far
as I can get, mate.

1416
01:09:21,686 --> 01:09:23,104
But I need to get to the start
of the race.

1417
01:09:23,187 --> 01:09:25,732
Well, it's just over the bridge.
That's fifteen quid, mate.

1418
01:09:25,815 --> 01:09:26,941
Have you got any money?

1419
01:09:27,024 --> 01:09:28,818
Sir, we have
a slight liquidity problem.

1420
01:09:28,901 --> 01:09:30,820
That is a shame.

1421
01:09:33,156 --> 01:09:34,157
Uh, no. Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

1422
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:36,242
Look, look. This is a 19...

1423
01:09:36,325 --> 01:09:39,787
...40 Rolex 520 Perpetual
Oyster with a bubble back.

1424
01:09:39,871 --> 01:09:40,872
That's not too shabby.

1425
01:09:40,955 --> 01:09:41,956
Gordon,
you can't possibly give him--

1426
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:43,207
Hey, it's an investment.

1427
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:45,835
Gordon, thank you.

1428
01:09:45,918 --> 01:09:47,086
I'll see you later then.

1429
01:09:49,464 --> 01:09:50,882
# Keep on runnin' #

1430
01:09:50,965 --> 01:09:52,258
Hey, good luck!

1431
01:09:52,341 --> 01:09:54,177
Now, typically,
the day would have started...

1432
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:56,429
at the crack of dawn
for most of these runners.

1433
01:09:56,512 --> 01:09:57,847
They had a balanced breakfast...

1434
01:09:57,930 --> 01:10:01,309
precise physical
and mental preparation.

1435
01:10:01,392 --> 01:10:04,604
On a day like today,
to leave anything to chance...

1436
01:10:04,687 --> 01:10:06,689
you'd either have
to be extremely naive...

1437
01:10:06,773 --> 01:10:08,149
or a complete idiot.

1438
01:10:08,232 --> 01:10:10,651
# Everyone is talkin' about me #

1439
01:10:16,199 --> 01:10:17,700
Over here. To me, to me.

1440
01:10:19,243 --> 01:10:20,286
That's it. Be careful.

1441
01:10:20,369 --> 01:10:21,496
That's an antique.

1442
01:10:22,288 --> 01:10:24,374
- Did it start? Did it start?
- Not yet.

1443
01:10:24,457 --> 01:10:25,666
- Turn it on.
- Here we go.

1444
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:27,085
What do we love
about these days...

1445
01:10:27,168 --> 01:10:29,420
is the sheer
mix of competitors.

1446
01:10:29,504 --> 01:10:31,172
They come
in all shapes and sizes...

1447
01:10:31,255 --> 01:10:35,593
from the elite over there
to the--how should we put it--

1448
01:10:35,676 --> 01:10:37,220
not so elite.

1449
01:10:38,346 --> 01:10:39,680
That's Dennis!

1450
01:10:41,891 --> 01:10:43,559
Look at that stretch.
Look at that.

1451
01:10:45,144 --> 01:10:46,354
Double or nothing?

1452
01:10:46,437 --> 01:10:47,438
Yeah, right.

1453
01:10:47,522 --> 01:10:51,192
Just a few minutes to go now.
The warm-ups should be complete.

1454
01:10:51,275 --> 01:10:54,654
It's time, if you have one,
for that pre-race ritual.

1455
01:10:56,572 --> 01:10:58,866
Well, well, well.
You made it, huh?

1456
01:10:58,950 --> 01:10:59,951
Yeah.

1457
01:11:00,034 --> 01:11:01,619
Just wanna wish you luck
out there.

1458
01:11:01,702 --> 01:11:04,372
You, too. How are your nipples?

1459
01:11:05,873 --> 01:11:06,958
Great.

1460
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:18,261
- More toast.
- Only a few moments...

1461
01:11:18,344 --> 01:11:19,595
to go now,
and the officials are--

1462
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:21,723
Who do you want to win,
Daddy or Whit?

1463
01:11:21,806 --> 01:11:24,767
- Who do you wanna win?
- Daddy, of course.

1464
01:11:24,851 --> 01:11:26,519
- If you're one
of the fun runners...
- What about you?

1465
01:11:26,602 --> 01:11:28,938
- it's just about
completing the course.
- Eat your toast.

1466
01:11:29,021 --> 01:11:31,149
And what a great turnout
we've got here today.

1467
01:11:43,828 --> 01:11:45,079
Why am I always the tortoise?

1468
01:11:45,163 --> 01:11:46,164
A bet's a bet.

1469
01:11:46,247 --> 01:11:47,248
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

1470
01:11:47,331 --> 01:11:48,750
- Pardon me.
- All right.

1471
01:11:50,752 --> 01:11:52,253
Well, Dennis, I gotta admit...

1472
01:11:52,336 --> 01:11:53,755
I didn't think
you'd make it this far.

1473
01:11:54,464 --> 01:11:55,715
I mean, uh...

1474
01:11:55,798 --> 01:11:58,051
you don't exactly have
the best, uh, track record...

1475
01:11:58,134 --> 01:11:59,177
now, do you?

1476
01:11:59,260 --> 01:12:01,220
Yeah, well that was then,
and this is now.

1477
01:12:01,304 --> 01:12:02,388
No, Dennis.

1478
01:12:04,682 --> 01:12:05,767
This is now.

1479
01:12:11,939 --> 01:12:13,107
All right.

1480
01:12:17,487 --> 01:12:19,030
Don't feel you have to keep up
with me.

1481
01:12:19,113 --> 01:12:20,698
Well, don't feel
you have to keep up with me.

1482
01:12:20,782 --> 01:12:22,658
Oh, yeah, that's the spirit.

1483
01:12:22,742 --> 01:12:24,160
And they're off, Chris.

1484
01:12:24,243 --> 01:12:25,912
Yet another great marathon...

1485
01:12:25,995 --> 01:12:27,789
getting under way
here in London.

1486
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:32,418
And having these great runners
go 26.2 miles...

1487
01:12:32,502 --> 01:12:34,796
of crowded London streets...

1488
01:12:34,879 --> 01:12:36,631
That was great, what you did
with Jake yesterday, by the way.

1489
01:12:36,714 --> 01:12:37,715
Thanks.

1490
01:12:37,799 --> 01:12:39,425
I know Libby
really appreciated it, too.

1491
01:12:39,509 --> 01:12:40,510
Oh, I'm glad.

1492
01:12:40,593 --> 01:12:41,636
In fact,
she was so appreciative...

1493
01:12:41,719 --> 01:12:43,471
we had a nice little jump
on the bed.

1494
01:12:43,554 --> 01:12:45,056
- What?
- Have a good race.

1495
01:12:56,943 --> 01:12:58,111
Isn't it enough?

1496
01:12:58,194 --> 01:12:59,195
What?

1497
01:12:59,278 --> 01:13:01,781
You got the girl, all right?
Isn't it enough?

1498
01:13:01,864 --> 01:13:03,199
I just think it's high time
you realize...

1499
01:13:03,282 --> 01:13:04,867
that it's over, sir.

1500
01:13:04,951 --> 01:13:06,411
Otherwise, it's gonna be
very tough for you...

1501
01:13:06,494 --> 01:13:08,788
- when we move to Chicago.
- What?

1502
01:13:08,871 --> 01:13:10,373
You better
slow down there, chief.

1503
01:13:10,456 --> 01:13:11,749
You got a long way to go.

1504
01:13:11,833 --> 01:13:15,336
- Yeah, well, so have you.
- Oh, yeah!

1505
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:16,587
Yes, I like it.

1506
01:13:16,671 --> 01:13:18,589
Run, fat boy, run!

1507
01:13:23,094 --> 01:13:24,679
I can lose weight...

1508
01:13:24,762 --> 01:13:26,681
but you'll always be
an asshole.

1509
01:13:27,557 --> 01:13:28,725
Now, once again,
it's still being dominated...

1510
01:13:28,808 --> 01:13:30,059
- by the Kenyans, Denise.
- Look at that.

1511
01:13:30,143 --> 01:13:32,645
The runners are making their way
along the embankment.

1512
01:13:32,729 --> 01:13:34,021
What a beautiful view of the...

1513
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:42,530
So, here we are
among the leaders of the moment.

1514
01:13:42,613 --> 01:13:45,324
The pace is relatively relaxed
for the opening miles.

1515
01:13:47,410 --> 01:13:48,536
Maybe a little too relaxed,
Chris.

1516
01:13:48,619 --> 01:13:50,288
It looks like we've got
a couple of amateurs...

1517
01:13:50,371 --> 01:13:51,456
coming up from the back.

1518
01:13:55,752 --> 01:13:56,753
Mom!

1519
01:13:56,836 --> 01:13:58,463
It looks like these two boys...

1520
01:13:58,546 --> 01:14:00,465
are running a race
of their own here today.

1521
01:14:00,548 --> 01:14:01,758
In fact,
they're causing quite a stir...

1522
01:14:01,841 --> 01:14:02,967
among the serious runners.

1523
01:14:03,051 --> 01:14:04,719
Not something
you'd really expect...

1524
01:14:04,802 --> 01:14:06,179
at this stage in the race.

1525
01:14:06,262 --> 01:14:07,472
Oh. Sorry, sir.

1526
01:14:08,181 --> 01:14:09,265
There's a man down.

1527
01:14:11,142 --> 01:14:12,226
Sorry.

1528
01:14:13,436 --> 01:14:16,105
All eyes right now
are on these two runners.

1529
01:14:16,189 --> 01:14:18,024
No, no, no, no, no.
What are you doing?

1530
01:14:18,107 --> 01:14:20,485
- We hope to bring you
that information quickly.
- Slow down.

1531
01:14:21,069 --> 01:14:22,070
But he looks good, doesn't he?

1532
01:14:22,153 --> 01:14:23,362
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

1533
01:14:23,446 --> 01:14:25,656
...setting a new world record.

1534
01:14:30,703 --> 01:14:31,704
What are you trying to prove?

1535
01:14:31,788 --> 01:14:33,373
She doesn't
love you any more, man.

1536
01:14:33,456 --> 01:14:34,665
I'm not doing this for Libby.

1537
01:14:34,749 --> 01:14:35,792
Yeah, right.

1538
01:14:35,875 --> 01:14:36,918
You're ridiculous, dude.

1539
01:14:37,001 --> 01:14:39,420
What's the matter, Whit,
can't keep up?

1540
01:14:48,721 --> 01:14:49,806
Oh!

1541
01:14:55,728 --> 01:14:56,896
Daddy!

1542
01:14:56,979 --> 01:14:58,856
Dennis! I mean, Whit!

1543
01:15:04,695 --> 01:15:05,947
It does look very serious.

1544
01:15:06,030 --> 01:15:07,115
We're getting
some more information--

1545
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:26,884
Stay down! Stay down!

1546
01:15:41,941 --> 01:15:43,317
Where do you think you're going?

1547
01:15:43,401 --> 01:15:46,112
- I have to go help Dennis.
- Why?

1548
01:15:46,195 --> 01:15:48,281
Because I am
the assistant coach.

1549
01:15:49,991 --> 01:15:51,075
Yes!

1550
01:15:51,159 --> 01:15:53,536
He now leads
at the ten-mile mark.

1551
01:15:56,873 --> 01:15:57,874
And that looks really painful.

1552
01:15:57,957 --> 01:15:59,333
Looks like
this runner's race day...

1553
01:15:59,417 --> 01:16:01,419
will be ending
at a Leeds hospital.

1554
01:16:01,502 --> 01:16:02,837
Yeah, absolutely tragic--

1555
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:04,464
Mom, do something!

1556
01:16:04,547 --> 01:16:06,049
- We certainly do.
Let's get back...
- Come on.

1557
01:16:06,132 --> 01:16:07,508
to the leaders
in the female race.

1558
01:16:16,893 --> 01:16:17,977
Shit.

1559
01:16:44,754 --> 01:16:46,547
Huh?

1560
01:16:48,257 --> 01:16:50,927
Gordon, I think I speak
for everyone here...

1561
01:16:51,010 --> 01:16:53,471
when I say, "Give me my money."

1562
01:16:53,554 --> 01:16:55,348
Five grand, please.

1563
01:16:57,934 --> 01:16:59,852
OK, here's the thing
about the money...

1564
01:16:59,936 --> 01:17:01,020
and, actually,
it's kind of funny.

1565
01:17:02,271 --> 01:17:04,107
Uh...I don't have it.

1566
01:17:06,567 --> 01:17:07,860
Would you excuse us a moment?

1567
01:17:12,990 --> 01:17:15,201
Hi. I'm looking
for a patient, Dennis Doyle.

1568
01:17:15,284 --> 01:17:16,661
Are you family?

1569
01:17:16,744 --> 01:17:18,329
- Yeah.
- Doyle?

1570
01:17:18,413 --> 01:17:19,914
Yes, Dennis Doyle.

1571
01:17:21,541 --> 01:17:22,750
Oh, I'm sorry,
we don't seem to have anyone...

1572
01:17:22,834 --> 01:17:24,419
registered by that name.

1573
01:17:24,502 --> 01:17:27,171
Are you sure?
He's a runner in the marathon.

1574
01:17:27,255 --> 01:17:28,631
Oh, the runner. Oh, yeah.

1575
01:17:28,715 --> 01:17:30,675
Well, he's just arrived.

1576
01:17:30,758 --> 01:17:32,385
- Libby?
- Whit?

1577
01:17:32,468 --> 01:17:33,720
How'd you know I was here?

1578
01:17:33,803 --> 01:17:35,179
What are you doing here?

1579
01:17:35,263 --> 01:17:37,432
Honey,
that psychopath tripped me.

1580
01:17:37,515 --> 01:17:40,059
He tripped me.
I think I have ligament damage.

1581
01:17:40,143 --> 01:17:41,728
Guys, can we-- Can we just--

1582
01:17:41,811 --> 01:17:44,147
Fellas, can we--
Look, I'm a patient, please.

1583
01:17:44,230 --> 01:17:45,815
Just one-- Find me!

1584
01:17:45,898 --> 01:17:47,442
Easy, easy! Ow!

1585
01:17:47,525 --> 01:17:49,485
Vince, look, when I said
I didn't have the money...

1586
01:17:49,569 --> 01:17:50,570
I meant
I didn't have the money here.

1587
01:17:50,653 --> 01:17:52,739
- I can pay.
- Oh, you're gonna pay.

1588
01:17:53,990 --> 01:17:57,035
No, wait. Look...Vincent.

1589
01:17:57,118 --> 01:17:58,703
Wait-- Wait-- What?

1590
01:17:58,786 --> 01:18:00,038
Wait. Wait a tick.

1591
01:18:05,334 --> 01:18:07,670
Not so bloody fast, mate.

1592
01:18:07,754 --> 01:18:09,047
Who the hell are you?

1593
01:18:09,130 --> 01:18:10,757
Thanks a lot, Mr G!

1594
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:12,592
Your friend is a man of honour.

1595
01:18:12,675 --> 01:18:13,676
What, Vincent?

1596
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:17,597
Yes, he said he's going to kick
shit out of you later instead.

1597
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:18,681
I don't understand.

1598
01:18:18,765 --> 01:18:21,684
On the TV, they said
he was being brought here.

1599
01:18:21,768 --> 01:18:23,186
One second.

1600
01:18:23,269 --> 01:18:24,687
I could sue him.
You know that, right?

1601
01:18:24,771 --> 01:18:26,022
I could sue him
for everyhing he has...

1602
01:18:26,105 --> 01:18:28,107
but, you know, seriously,
what am I gonna do...

1603
01:18:28,191 --> 01:18:31,402
with some pizza boxes
and a Judas Priest t-shirt?

1604
01:18:31,486 --> 01:18:33,154
Honey,
I'm sure it was an accident.

1605
01:18:33,237 --> 01:18:34,864
Well, you weren't there, OK?

1606
01:18:34,947 --> 01:18:36,991
You didn't see it.
He was wild-eyed, all right?

1607
01:18:37,075 --> 01:18:39,327
He was frothing at the mouth
at one point.

1608
01:18:39,410 --> 01:18:42,288
It was like running a marathon
with Cujo, OK?

1609
01:18:42,372 --> 01:18:45,625
Jake, buddy,
can I control the bed, please?

1610
01:18:45,708 --> 01:18:47,627
No, but you can watch me
control it.

1611
01:18:50,213 --> 01:18:51,714
Libby? Where are you?

1612
01:18:51,798 --> 01:18:53,091
- The hospital.
- Are you with him?

1613
01:18:53,174 --> 01:18:54,175
No, he's not here.

1614
01:18:54,258 --> 01:18:55,301
Well, what do you mean
he's not there?

1615
01:18:55,385 --> 01:18:56,803
I mean, he's not here.

1616
01:18:57,470 --> 01:18:58,971
Well,
where the hell is he then?

1617
01:19:29,293 --> 01:19:31,963
All right.
It's still-- It's on.

1618
01:19:32,046 --> 01:19:33,214
The race is still on.

1619
01:19:34,090 --> 01:19:36,759
I can't believe
you let Gordon go, Vincent.

1620
01:19:36,843 --> 01:19:38,010
- Yeah, but he said
he was gonna pay us...
- Back to the story.

1621
01:19:38,094 --> 01:19:40,012
- right, Vincent?
- The first images
are coming in...

1622
01:19:40,096 --> 01:19:41,931
- from what looks
like a camera phone...
- Vincent?

1623
01:19:42,014 --> 01:19:44,517
- Vincent?
- showing a lone,
mysterious runner.

1624
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:47,979
Uh, he's looking very badly
injured, I must say...

1625
01:19:48,062 --> 01:19:50,064
and he's also causing
some major traffic--

1626
01:19:51,858 --> 01:19:53,151
- Cab.
- Yeah, it's a Rolex.

1627
01:19:53,234 --> 01:19:55,361
I'm not gonna sell it.
It's a family heirloom now.

1628
01:19:56,404 --> 01:19:57,488
What!

1629
01:19:58,948 --> 01:20:00,867
Wait! What are you doing?!

1630
01:20:00,950 --> 01:20:03,578
- Step on it!
- You can't
just take a man's cab!

1631
01:20:05,496 --> 01:20:06,497
All right!

1632
01:20:06,581 --> 01:20:07,749
Hello, there...

1633
01:20:07,832 --> 01:20:09,709
Dennis Doyle from downstairs!

1634
01:20:09,792 --> 01:20:11,085
Who the hell are you?

1635
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:13,921
You beauty, come on!

1636
01:20:15,256 --> 01:20:17,008
And as the sun
sets over London...

1637
01:20:17,091 --> 01:20:18,718
we're still looking
into the identity...

1638
01:20:18,801 --> 01:20:21,596
of that mysterious runner.

1639
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:24,182
Come on, Dennis,
you can do it! Come on!

1640
01:20:24,265 --> 01:20:26,059
The only concrete thing
we do know...

1641
01:20:26,142 --> 01:20:29,729
is that he's running
for erectile dysfunction.

1642
01:20:31,647 --> 01:20:33,566
Good news, Mr Bloom.

1643
01:20:33,649 --> 01:20:35,943
No rupture, no ligament damage.

1644
01:20:36,027 --> 01:20:37,653
Oh, that's great.

1645
01:20:37,737 --> 01:20:38,780
Jake, please?

1646
01:20:38,863 --> 01:20:41,657
In fact,
there's no real damage anywhere.

1647
01:20:42,575 --> 01:20:43,618
Are you sure, doctor?

1648
01:20:43,701 --> 01:20:45,244
Jake, please.

1649
01:20:45,328 --> 01:20:47,497
It's, uh, like, uh...

1650
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:48,581
What is it you runners say?

1651
01:20:48,664 --> 01:20:50,166
You hit the wall.

1652
01:20:52,043 --> 01:20:53,753
No, no, that--
That's not possi--

1653
01:20:55,630 --> 01:20:56,923
God damn it, will you stop...

1654
01:20:57,006 --> 01:20:59,092
messin' around with the bed,
you little shit?!

1655
01:21:00,676 --> 01:21:01,803
God.

1656
01:21:08,309 --> 01:21:10,603
Good evening.
It's time for a sports update.

1657
01:21:10,686 --> 01:21:12,480
Top story, the Nike River Run.

1658
01:21:12,563 --> 01:21:14,440
We'll be chatting to the winner
a little bit later on...

1659
01:21:14,524 --> 01:21:16,984
but first, we've had thousands
of e-mails and calls...

1660
01:21:17,068 --> 01:21:18,694
about our mystery runner.

1661
01:21:18,778 --> 01:21:20,488
Well, I can tell you now,
our TV crew...

1662
01:21:20,571 --> 01:21:21,656
has just caught up with him.

1663
01:21:21,739 --> 01:21:22,740
Excuse me. Sorry.

1664
01:21:22,824 --> 01:21:24,033
Will you slow down, please?

1665
01:21:30,081 --> 01:21:31,791
You hungry?
You wanna get a bite?

1666
01:21:31,874 --> 01:21:33,710
Stop! Stop!

1667
01:21:33,793 --> 01:21:35,086
Everyone out. Get out.

1668
01:21:36,337 --> 01:21:37,422
- Come on!
- I'm goin'!

1669
01:21:37,505 --> 01:21:38,673
Hey!

1670
01:21:38,756 --> 01:21:39,966
Just go away!

1671
01:21:40,842 --> 01:21:42,051
- Somebody trip him.
- Go away!

1672
01:21:42,135 --> 01:21:43,428
Knock him over.

1673
01:21:43,511 --> 01:21:45,346
No, invalid. Off-side.

1674
01:21:46,180 --> 01:21:48,015
- Oh!
- Leave him alone! Get off him!

1675
01:21:48,099 --> 01:21:49,851
I want my money now!

1676
01:21:49,934 --> 01:21:51,519
Don't listen to them, Dennis!

1677
01:21:51,602 --> 01:21:52,645
You are a winner!

1678
01:21:52,729 --> 01:21:53,813
I want my money now!

1679
01:21:53,896 --> 01:21:56,357
Stop it! I'm wearing helmet!

1680
01:21:56,441 --> 01:21:57,442
Clear off!

1681
01:21:57,525 --> 01:21:59,819
"The loneliness
of the long-distance runner"...

1682
01:21:59,902 --> 01:22:03,197
a phrase epitomized by this man,
Dennis Doyle.

1683
01:22:03,281 --> 01:22:04,991
For the last eleven miles,
he's been running...

1684
01:22:05,074 --> 01:22:08,286
on what appears to be
a severely sprained ankle.

1685
01:22:08,369 --> 01:22:11,581
What a testament to the power
of the human spirit.

1686
01:22:11,664 --> 01:22:13,166
Mr Doyle, how do you feel?

1687
01:22:13,249 --> 01:22:14,625
How the fuck
do you think I feel?

1688
01:22:14,709 --> 01:22:16,044
What an inspiration.

1689
01:22:16,127 --> 01:22:18,838
We'll keep you updated
as this story progresses.

1690
01:22:18,921 --> 01:22:20,840
- Get out of the bloody way!
- Sorry.

1691
01:22:20,923 --> 01:22:23,051
- Well, what a remarkable day...
- Libby. Libby, I'm sorry...

1692
01:22:23,134 --> 01:22:24,886
- we've had at
the marathon on the Thames...
- all right? I lost it. I--

1693
01:22:24,969 --> 01:22:26,637
- with an event
dominated as ever...
- I wasn't thinking.

1694
01:22:26,721 --> 01:22:28,473
- by the crowds
and the fun runners...
- I'm sorry.

1695
01:22:28,556 --> 01:22:30,099
- Honey, can we just--
- but particularly by

1696
01:22:30,183 --> 01:22:31,184
- Jake, buddy...
- one man.

1697
01:22:31,267 --> 01:22:32,268
would you mind just giving us...

1698
01:22:32,351 --> 01:22:33,853
a little peace with the TV,
please?

1699
01:22:34,353 --> 01:22:35,354
- Thank you.
- Go on, Dennis!

1700
01:22:35,438 --> 01:22:36,439
The whole of London...

1701
01:22:36,522 --> 01:22:38,816
Honey, can we
just talk about this, please?

1702
01:22:42,195 --> 01:22:43,821
- Chin up!
- Keep it up, mate!

1703
01:22:45,615 --> 01:22:47,158
Do you know, Mr Doyle, sir?

1704
01:22:47,241 --> 01:22:48,242
Oh.

1705
01:22:48,326 --> 01:22:50,119
I'm the assistant coach.

1706
01:22:50,203 --> 01:22:51,829
Oh. Oh, really.
What's your name?

1707
01:22:51,913 --> 01:22:55,124
- Uh, Mr Ghoshdashtidar.
- Gosh--

1708
01:22:55,208 --> 01:22:56,209
- Ghosh...
- Gah--

1709
01:22:56,292 --> 01:22:57,960
OK, just call me John.

1710
01:22:59,253 --> 01:23:02,173
It was me who discovered
his potential.

1711
01:23:06,761 --> 01:23:08,137
I can't breathe.

1712
01:23:08,930 --> 01:23:10,181
My head's gonna explode.

1713
01:23:10,264 --> 01:23:11,891
He's not gonna make it.

1714
01:23:11,974 --> 01:23:13,601
I-- I have to stop.

1715
01:23:13,684 --> 01:23:15,061
- I have to stop this.
- No.

1716
01:23:15,144 --> 01:23:16,270
- I'm sorry.
- No, you can't.
What are you doing?

1717
01:23:16,354 --> 01:23:17,563
You can't stop.
You're nearly there.

1718
01:23:17,647 --> 01:23:19,107
What? How much further?

1719
01:23:19,190 --> 01:23:22,568
It-- It's a little, tiny--
Nine miles.

1720
01:23:25,822 --> 01:23:27,448
OK. OK.

1721
01:23:42,964 --> 01:23:44,215
Oh, no.

1722
01:23:45,258 --> 01:23:46,426
What?

1723
01:23:47,844 --> 01:23:49,095
He's hit it.

1724
01:24:08,573 --> 01:24:10,366
OK, baby,
let's get you to bed.

1725
01:24:11,117 --> 01:24:12,118
Jakey.

1726
01:24:12,201 --> 01:24:14,287
-...by the crowds
and the fun runners.
- Dennis.

1727
01:24:14,370 --> 01:24:15,872
- For those of you
just joining us...
- Dennis?

1728
01:24:15,955 --> 01:24:18,666
it looks like Dennis Doyle, a
clothing store security guard...

1729
01:24:18,750 --> 01:24:20,752
running for the last ten
and three quarter hours...

1730
01:24:20,835 --> 01:24:22,712
on basically one leg...

1731
01:24:22,795 --> 01:24:26,382
is refusing to rest
until this race is run.

1732
01:24:26,466 --> 01:24:28,551
Unbelievable!

1733
01:24:58,206 --> 01:25:01,084
You've never finished anything
in your entire life, Dennis.

1734
01:25:03,211 --> 01:25:05,546
All you're gonna
wanna do is give up.

1735
01:25:05,630 --> 01:25:06,964
I'm not the quitter!

1736
01:25:07,048 --> 01:25:09,092
That's exactly
what you're gonna do, Dennis.

1737
01:25:09,175 --> 01:25:11,344
Go on, run away!
Run away!

1738
01:25:11,427 --> 01:25:13,012
That's what you always do!

1739
01:25:16,182 --> 01:25:17,266
Dennis!

1740
01:25:19,644 --> 01:25:20,728
Dennis!

1741
01:25:24,232 --> 01:25:25,650
Dennis?

1742
01:25:33,783 --> 01:25:35,243
Oh, I don't believe this.

1743
01:25:35,326 --> 01:25:36,703
Yeah, boy, yes!

1744
01:25:36,786 --> 01:25:38,329
He's still going!

1745
01:25:38,413 --> 01:25:41,582
Go on, you beautiful man!

1746
01:25:41,666 --> 01:25:43,626
Apologies there,
ladies and gentlemen, uh...

1747
01:25:43,710 --> 01:25:46,379
but it's, uh, really rather hard
not to get caught up...

1748
01:25:46,462 --> 01:25:47,839
in the drama of it all.

1749
01:25:48,881 --> 01:25:51,926
Now let's take one more look
at how Dennis broke that ankle.

1750
01:25:52,009 --> 01:25:53,094
And here it is.

1751
01:25:53,177 --> 01:25:54,595
It appears
that the runner there...

1752
01:25:54,679 --> 01:25:57,974
next to Mr Doyle
is involved in some way.

1753
01:25:58,057 --> 01:26:01,769
In fact, if we look at it again
here...yes!

1754
01:26:01,853 --> 01:26:04,021
He deliberately trips him!

1755
01:26:04,105 --> 01:26:05,690
Bastard!

1756
01:26:05,773 --> 01:26:07,066
Apologies again, uh...

1757
01:26:07,150 --> 01:26:09,110
That didn't--
That's not what happened.

1758
01:26:09,193 --> 01:26:10,695
That is--
That-- That didn't happen.

1759
01:26:10,778 --> 01:26:12,405
I can't believe this.

1760
01:26:12,488 --> 01:26:13,489
I don't believe it, either.

1761
01:26:13,573 --> 01:26:14,574
I don't understand that.

1762
01:26:14,657 --> 01:26:15,658
What is that?

1763
01:26:15,742 --> 01:26:17,160
Honey. Honey...

1764
01:26:17,243 --> 01:26:21,372
That angle makes it look, but--
He tripped me.

1765
01:26:22,457 --> 01:26:24,333
He tripped me! Yes, he did!

1766
01:26:24,417 --> 01:26:27,128
- Go, Dennis!
- It's him! Dennis!

1767
01:26:29,130 --> 01:26:30,423
Go, Dennis!

1768
01:26:34,093 --> 01:26:35,428
I can't believe this.

1769
01:26:35,511 --> 01:26:36,763
Come on, honey.

1770
01:26:36,846 --> 01:26:38,222
Please, like I'm gonna do that.

1771
01:26:38,890 --> 01:26:40,183
What are you--
Are you kidding me?

1772
01:26:40,266 --> 01:26:41,434
Honey.

1773
01:26:42,977 --> 01:26:44,187
All right, look,
I'm just-- I'm not--

1774
01:26:44,270 --> 01:26:45,772
I'm not myself, OK?

1775
01:26:46,939 --> 01:26:48,649
I haven't been myself
for a long time.

1776
01:26:48,733 --> 01:26:50,234
Work has not been...

1777
01:26:51,069 --> 01:26:52,945
It's, uh...

1778
01:26:53,029 --> 01:26:54,030
It's just this city, you know?

1779
01:26:54,113 --> 01:26:56,115
It's just--
It's really hard here for me.

1780
01:26:56,199 --> 01:26:57,784
You know,
everyone's so polite here...

1781
01:26:57,867 --> 01:26:59,911
and it's like the food and the--
and the--and the ca--

1782
01:26:59,994 --> 01:27:01,371
I just don't-- I don't
know what happened to me.

1783
01:27:01,454 --> 01:27:03,164
I don't know what--
It's just this place.

1784
01:27:03,247 --> 01:27:04,374
It's this place, you know?

1785
01:27:04,457 --> 01:27:07,418
And if we-- I just know it's
gonna be better once we move.

1786
01:27:07,502 --> 01:27:09,087
- Move?
- To Chicago.

1787
01:27:09,170 --> 01:27:10,421
What?

1788
01:27:10,505 --> 01:27:11,714
Too soon?

1789
01:27:11,798 --> 01:27:12,799
Oh!

1790
01:27:12,882 --> 01:27:14,425
- Come on, Jake.
- Libby, wh--

1791
01:27:14,509 --> 01:27:15,760
Where you goin'?
Where you goin'?

1792
01:27:16,844 --> 01:27:18,763
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
Dennis?

1793
01:27:18,846 --> 01:27:20,098
You can't be serious.

1794
01:27:20,181 --> 01:27:23,101
The guy left you
at the altar pregnant.

1795
01:27:24,977 --> 01:27:26,312
Nobody's perfect.

1796
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:28,481
Libby.

1797
01:27:28,564 --> 01:27:30,233
Libby! L--

1798
01:27:30,316 --> 01:27:31,359
What a shithead.

1799
01:27:31,442 --> 01:27:32,527
Jake.

1800
01:27:33,861 --> 01:27:35,488
Hey. I know you feel bad.

1801
01:27:35,571 --> 01:27:36,614
I know you're
in incredible pain...

1802
01:27:36,698 --> 01:27:39,117
but you are so close
to me going on holiday.

1803
01:27:39,992 --> 01:27:41,077
Come on.

1804
01:27:56,426 --> 01:27:59,011
Dennis! Dennis! Dennis!

1805
01:27:59,095 --> 01:28:02,306
Dennis! Dennis! Dennis!

1806
01:28:02,390 --> 01:28:06,644
Dennis! Dennis! Dennis!

1807
01:28:06,728 --> 01:28:09,439
As we draw tantalizingly
close to the finish line...

1808
01:28:09,522 --> 01:28:11,232
here at St. Paul's Cathedral...

1809
01:28:11,315 --> 01:28:13,776
it's safe to say,
it's been a very long day...

1810
01:28:13,860 --> 01:28:15,695
for myself and my cameraman.

1811
01:28:15,778 --> 01:28:18,656
It's been a very long day
for you watching at home...

1812
01:28:18,740 --> 01:28:19,741
but for Dennis Doyle...

1813
01:28:19,824 --> 01:28:22,410
it's been the single longest day
of his life.

1814
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:38,384
Come on, Dennis!

1815
01:28:39,385 --> 01:28:40,470
Good work, Dennis!

1816
01:28:44,724 --> 01:28:46,267
Hey! Move along!

1817
01:28:46,350 --> 01:28:47,351
That's it. You're there.

1818
01:28:47,435 --> 01:28:49,145
You're sixty feet.

1819
01:28:49,228 --> 01:28:50,563
Fifty-- Fifty-eight feet.

1820
01:28:51,606 --> 01:28:52,815
Call it fifty-six
and a half feet...

1821
01:28:52,899 --> 01:28:53,900
and you're there. Come on.

1822
01:28:53,983 --> 01:28:57,111
That's my man! My man!

1823
01:29:05,828 --> 01:29:06,954
Come on, come on!

1824
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:16,964
Dennis, come on.

1825
01:29:19,133 --> 01:29:21,302
Stay down, you shamble of a man.

1826
01:29:21,386 --> 01:29:22,553
Don't get up.

1827
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:25,765
Dennis!

1828
01:29:26,724 --> 01:29:27,850
Dennis, come on, get up.

1829
01:29:27,934 --> 01:29:29,477
Dennis, you're
at the finish line. Get up.

1830
01:29:30,561 --> 01:29:32,230
Dennis, this looks bad.
People are talking.

1831
01:29:32,313 --> 01:29:33,398
Get up.

1832
01:29:47,453 --> 01:29:48,538
Hello, Dennis?

1833
01:29:52,917 --> 01:29:54,877
- Dennis!
- Dad!

1834
01:30:00,383 --> 01:30:02,719
Dennis!

1835
01:30:02,802 --> 01:30:03,886
Dad!

1836
01:30:21,028 --> 01:30:22,780
Go on! You've got it! Go on!

1837
01:30:26,034 --> 01:30:28,202
Come on, Dennis! Yeah!

1838
01:30:32,165 --> 01:30:33,249
Yeah!

1839
01:30:37,837 --> 01:30:38,921
Dad!

1840
01:30:39,589 --> 01:30:42,175
That was a really stupid thing
you did out there today.

1841
01:30:42,258 --> 01:30:44,093
Don't go to Chicago.

1842
01:30:44,177 --> 01:30:45,762
Dad, you won!

1843
01:30:50,224 --> 01:30:51,559
He's done it!

1844
01:30:51,642 --> 01:30:53,352
He's actually done it!

1845
01:30:53,436 --> 01:30:54,562
This morning...

1846
01:30:54,645 --> 01:30:58,149
Dennis Doyle was a humble
shop worker from North London!

1847
01:30:58,232 --> 01:31:00,818
Tonight, he goes home a hero!

1848
01:31:00,902 --> 01:31:02,695
Oh, yay.

1849
01:31:02,779 --> 01:31:04,030
And look at that!

1850
01:31:04,113 --> 01:31:05,281
- God damn it.
- This extraordinary man...

1851
01:31:05,365 --> 01:31:07,283
collapses into the arms of--

1852
01:31:07,367 --> 01:31:09,827
I think it's backwards here--
the woman he loves!

1853
01:31:09,911 --> 01:31:12,413
And, look! He's got a son!

1854
01:31:12,497 --> 01:31:14,540
I didn't know he had a son!

1855
01:31:14,624 --> 01:31:16,209
Did you know he had a son?

1856
01:31:27,470 --> 01:31:29,263
- Hello, Dennis.
- Hey.

1857
01:31:42,819 --> 01:31:44,362
- Hi.
- Hi.

1858
01:31:44,445 --> 01:31:46,155
Jake, your dad's here!

1859
01:31:46,239 --> 01:31:47,782
How's it goin'?

1860
01:31:47,865 --> 01:31:49,158
- Pretty good.
- Good.

1861
01:31:49,242 --> 01:31:50,576
- You?
- Yeah.

1862
01:31:50,660 --> 01:31:52,120
Yeah, not bad.

1863
01:31:52,203 --> 01:31:53,329
You still running?

1864
01:31:53,413 --> 01:31:55,373
Every day, hopefully
in the right direction.

1865
01:31:59,127 --> 01:32:00,753
Yeah. So...

1866
01:32:02,213 --> 01:32:06,175
Um, Libby,
I was thinkin', um...

1867
01:32:08,636 --> 01:32:11,097
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, you.

1868
01:32:13,975 --> 01:32:14,976
Uh, it doesn't matter,
actually.

1869
01:32:15,059 --> 01:32:16,310
I'll, um...

1870
01:32:16,394 --> 01:32:17,645
I'll sp-- I'll ca--
I'll speak to you later.

1871
01:32:17,729 --> 01:32:19,313
- OK.
- Say goodbye to your mom.

1872
01:32:19,397 --> 01:32:20,523
Bye, Mom.

1873
01:32:20,606 --> 01:32:21,607
Bye. I'll see you later.

1874
01:32:21,691 --> 01:32:22,859
Bye.

1875
01:32:33,244 --> 01:32:35,204
Libby, I was wondering,
would you like to go...

1876
01:32:35,288 --> 01:32:37,206
and have some dinner
with me next week?

1877
01:32:42,295 --> 01:32:43,296
You don't have to.
It's not, uh...

1878
01:32:43,379 --> 01:32:44,589
Yeah.

1879
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:46,007
Uh...huh?

1880
01:32:46,090 --> 01:32:47,633
I mean, wow.

1881
01:32:47,717 --> 01:32:48,843
It'd be nice.

1882
01:32:48,926 --> 01:32:50,803
Yeah. Well, it would be.

1883
01:32:55,099 --> 01:32:56,893
I'll, um...
I'll give you a call.

1884
01:32:56,976 --> 01:32:58,019
OK.

1885
01:32:58,102 --> 01:32:59,604
Don't know why I did that.
It's just--

1886
01:33:01,189 --> 01:33:02,523
OK. Ready?

1887
01:33:02,607 --> 01:33:03,691
Yeah.

1888
01:33:06,152 --> 01:33:07,987
Hello!

1889
01:33:08,071 --> 01:33:09,614
Hello, Dennis!

1890
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:12,492
Mr G.

1891
01:33:13,034 --> 01:33:14,994
- Hello, Jake.
- Hello.

1892
01:33:15,078 --> 01:33:16,704
I was just doing my spin class.

1893
01:33:16,788 --> 01:33:17,789
It's great fun, isn't it?

1894
01:33:17,872 --> 01:33:20,333
Oh, it's an amazing workout!

1895
01:33:26,589 --> 01:33:28,299
Dad comin' up behind
the young contender.

1896
01:33:28,383 --> 01:33:29,592
Come on! Jake!

1897
01:33:29,675 --> 01:33:31,302
Oh, he takes the ball from Jake!

1898
01:33:31,386 --> 01:33:33,805
He has the ball! He's clear!

1899
01:33:33,888 --> 01:33:35,264
Dad! Pass it!

1900
01:33:36,682 --> 01:33:37,683
Dad is clear!

1901
01:33:37,767 --> 01:33:39,519
Give it!

1902
01:33:39,602 --> 01:33:41,437
I'll give you one, too.

1903
01:33:41,521 --> 01:33:43,606
OK, let's go. Good game.

1904
01:33:43,689 --> 01:33:45,358
Jake to Mr G.

1905
01:33:46,192 --> 01:33:47,652
Yeah, thank you very much.

1906
01:33:47,735 --> 01:33:48,861
Take over, Mr G.

1907
01:33:50,113 --> 01:33:51,322
There you go, Mr G.

1908
01:33:52,198 --> 01:33:55,034
All right, I'm gonna--
Completely illegal move there.

1909
01:33:55,118 --> 01:33:56,953
Picks up the player,
runs with him.

1910
01:33:57,036 --> 01:33:58,413
Runs with him all the way.

1911
01:33:58,496 --> 01:34:00,039
Dad, that's illegal!

1912
01:34:04,877 --> 01:34:05,962
But that's not all.

1913
01:34:06,671 --> 01:34:08,673
Because the guy,
he can't barely walk, OK...

1914
01:34:08,756 --> 01:34:10,758
Iet alone run,
but he keeps going...

1915
01:34:10,842 --> 01:34:13,678
and twenty-five miles
on a shattered ankle.

1916
01:34:13,761 --> 01:34:14,804
And you know how he did that?

1917
01:34:14,887 --> 01:34:16,097
You know what he said
was the one thing...

1918
01:34:16,180 --> 01:34:17,265
that kept him going?

1919
01:34:18,433 --> 01:34:19,726
His trainer
never gave up on him.

1920
01:34:19,809 --> 01:34:21,644
He stayed with him
the whole way.

1921
01:34:21,728 --> 01:34:22,729
And that was you?

1922
01:34:22,812 --> 01:34:23,896
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

1923
01:34:23,980 --> 01:34:25,606
It's a pretty amazing story,
actually.

1924
01:34:25,690 --> 01:34:27,108
I've got a bottle of champagne
opened here...

1925
01:34:27,191 --> 01:34:28,276
