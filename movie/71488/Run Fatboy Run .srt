- Whit! - Really.

149
00:07:49,005 --> 00:07:49,952
你干什么去了？
Where have you been?

150
00:07:50,089 --> 00:07:51,463
嗨
Hey.

151
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,620
-我… -爸！
- I was... - Daddy!

152
00:07:52,758 --> 00:07:54,464
小鼻涕孩儿！
Hey, snot-face!

153
00:07:54,593 --> 00:07:55,872
别这么叫他
Oh, please, don't call him that.

154
00:07:56,011 --> 00:07:57,385
怎么了？他不是鼻涕孩儿吗？
Why? He is a snot-face, isn't he?

155
00:07:57,512 --> 00:07:59,254
你是小鼻涕孩儿，对不？
You are a snot-face, aren't you? Huh?

156
00:07:59,267 --> 00:08:00,381
Oh.

157
00:08:01,766 --> 00:08:03,307
杰克，好恶心
Aw!

158
00:08:01,644 --> 00:08:03,138
Jake, that's disgusting.

159
00:08:03,435 --> 00:08:04,809
杰克，很恶心，去吧
Jake, that's disgusting. Go on.

160
00:08:06,103 --> 00:08:07,596
-先上厕所 -妈！
- Toilet first. - Mom!

161
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:10,099
去，穿上外套
Go on. Grab your jacket.

162
00:08:12,067 --> 00:08:14,058
你应该一个小时前到的
You were supposed to be here an hour ago, Dennis.

163
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:17,359
对，但…票有点小问题，所以
Yeah, there was a bit of a mix-up with the...

164
00:08:15,658 --> 00:08:17,200
with the tickets, so...

165
00:08:17,489 --> 00:08:18,602
你真漂亮
Hey, you look really nice.

166
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,818
那项链是我买的？
Did I get you that necklace?

167
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,071
不，是…
No. It was a...

168
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:24,442
别人送我的
just a present from someone... else.

169
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:26,736
-谁？ -我
- Who? - Uh, me, actually.

170
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:27,820
是
Oh, yeah.

171
00:08:27,957 --> 00:08:28,904
啊？
Huh?

172
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:30,618
我奶奶传下来的
It belonged to my grandmother.

173
00:08:30,752 --> 00:08:31,782
是啊
Yeah.

174
00:08:32,628 --> 00:08:33,658
啊？
Huh?

175
00:08:34,755 --> 00:08:37,327
丹尼斯，这是我的好朋友，威特
Dennis, this is my good friend, Whit.

176
00:08:37,465 --> 00:08:40,548
威特，这是我…儿子的爹，丹尼斯
Whit, this is my... Jake's dad, Dennis.

177
00:08:40,677 --> 00:08:41,956
你好吗？
How you doin'?

178
00:08:42,846 --> 00:08:44,339
好，手很软
Good, yeah. You have soft hands.

179
00:08:44,473 --> 00:08:45,634
你抹手霜？
Do you moisturize?

180
00:08:46,641 --> 00:08:47,671
是的
I do, actually.

181
00:08:49,644 --> 00:08:50,389
认识你很高兴
Well, it's very nice to meet you.

182
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,594
很高兴能把人和名字联系上
It's nice to finally put a face to the name.

183
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:53,677
我以为你…
I'd have probably thought you'd have...

184
00:08:53,815 --> 00:08:55,272
应该看过我俩的照片
you would have seen one of our photos.

185
00:08:56,234 --> 00:08:57,347
都没了
Oh, there aren't any.

186
00:08:58,069 --> 00:08:59,099
走吗？
- Hmm. - Ready?

187
00:08:59,236 --> 00:09:01,144
走
Yes. Let's go.

188
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,476
-玩的开心 -嗯
- Have fun. - Yeah.

189
00:09:02,614 --> 00:09:05,530
丹尼斯，你有票吗？
Dennis, you do have the tickets, right?

190
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:08,362
丽碧，相信我的智商
Libby, credit me with some intelligence.

191
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,116
票
Tickets!

192
00:09:15,251 --> 00:09:17,289
谁有票？
Does anybody have any tickets?

193
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,699
哥们，我女儿生病了
Mate, my daughter's not very well.

194
00:09:18,838 --> 00:09:20,081
你想要的话我这儿有几张
I've got a couple of spare tickets if you want 'em.

195
00:09:20,214 --> 00:09:21,671
好，谢谢，多少钱？
Yes. Thank you so much. How much?

196
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:22,829
你看着给
Oh, whatever.

197
00:09:22,967 --> 00:09:24,376
我就这些钱了
Uh, this is all the money I have.

198
00:09:25,928 --> 00:09:26,875
行吗？
Yeah?

199
00:09:27,012 --> 00:09:28,255
我儿子肯定爱死我了
My son is gonna love me.

200
00:09:28,388 --> 00:09:30,296
希望儿子爱你？那就别犯法
You want your son to love you? Don't break the law.

201
00:09:30,432 --> 00:09:32,304
你这是下套诱捕！
Hey, that's entrapment!

202
00:09:32,316 --> 00:09:33,858
Oh, God!

203
00:09:34,145 --> 00:09:35,803
这是滥用暴力！
And that's brutality!

204
00:09:37,438 --> 00:09:40,805
丽碧，只是警告一下
Libby, it's... It was only a caution.

205
00:09:42,401 --> 00:09:44,107
不，丽碧，我…
No. Uh, Libby, I'll...

206
00:09:44,236 --> 00:09:45,266
-拜，爸 -丽碧
- Bye, Dad. - Libby.

207
00:09:58,459 --> 00:09:59,952
你和丽碧一起在糕点店工作？
So, do you work with Libby at the bakery?

208
00:10:01,378 --> 00:10:02,408
不
No.

209
00:10:03,255 --> 00:10:04,498
我们倒是在糕点店认识的
We met at the bakery, though.

210
00:10:04,631 --> 00:10:06,088
-是吗？ -是啊
- Oh, yeah? - Yeah.

211
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,247
怎么了？
What?

212
00:10:08,385 --> 00:10:10,709
没什么，想起来那天我紧张得很
No, I just was a nervous wreck that day.

213
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:12,040
买了四个巧克力小饼
It took me four chocolate eclairs...

214
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:14,882
一个甜饼才鼓起勇气搭讪
and a macaroon just to get up the courage to talk to her.

215
00:10:17,434 --> 00:10:20,219
其实我在金融区工作
Uh, no, I work in the financial district actually.

216
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:23,511
我是沃特曼・休斯公司的对冲基金经理
I'm a hedge fund manager for Waterman Hughes.

217
00:10:23,648 --> 00:10:24,891
哦
Oh.

218
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:28,724
我在一家高档零售商店 做高级安全分析与实践
I do high-level security analysis and operation...

219
00:10:27,286 --> 00:10:28,566
for an upscale retail outlet.

220
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:30,236
真的？
Really?

221
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:33,398
丽碧说你是女服专卖店的保安
Libby said you were a security guard...

222
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,156
我说的就是这个
at a women's clothing store.

223
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:34,994
Yeah, that's what I said.

224
00:10:36,327 --> 00:10:37,736
对
Right.

225
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,991
我先打车走了
Uh, well, l... I should probably get a cab.

226
00:10:40,121 --> 00:10:41,744
明天早上还要长跑呢
I got a big run in the morning.

227
00:10:41,873 --> 00:10:43,330
长什么？
A big what?

228
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:46,291
跑，为下个月的耐克环河赛做训练
A run... I'm training for the Nike River Run next month.

229
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:47,366
什么？
The what-y what what?

230
00:10:47,503 --> 00:10:48,699
耐克环河赛
The Nike River Run.

231
00:10:48,838 --> 00:10:51,506
环绕泰晤士河的马拉松比赛
It's a... It's a marathon race along the, uh, Thames River.

232
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:53,960
你跑这个干什么？
Why would you do that?

233
00:10:54,094 --> 00:10:55,884
是个慈善比赛
Uh, well, it's a charity thing, you know?

234
00:10:56,012 --> 00:10:56,959
而且我喜欢跑步
Plus, I love to run.

235
00:10:57,096 --> 00:10:59,764
我之前还参加了伦敦马拉松
I actually ran the London Marathon a little while ago.

236
00:10:59,891 --> 00:11:00,838
真巧啊
Oh, that's a coincidence.

237
00:11:00,975 --> 00:11:01,922
怎么说？
Oh, yeah? How's that?

238
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:03,468
我看转播了
I watched it on the television.

239
00:11:03,602 --> 00:11:04,632
就看了最后一小时
- Ah. - Well, the last hour.

240
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,393
我星期天起得晚，所以…
I sleep in on a Sunday, so...

241
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:08,933
是啊
Right.

242
00:11:09,066 --> 00:11:11,353
你看
Um, well, look, you know...

243
00:11:11,484 --> 00:11:13,522
我知道这样挺尴尬的
I know these things can be pretty awkward, you know?

244
00:11:13,652 --> 00:11:15,145
你是杰克的父亲
I mean, you know, you're Jake's dad...

245
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,611
我只是希望你明白
and, uh, well, I just want you to know...

246
00:11:18,741 --> 00:11:24,528
我十分喜欢丽碧和杰克
that I like Libby and Jake very, very much...

247
00:11:24,664 --> 00:11:30,001
我很感激你对此事如此理智
and, um, well, I just appreciate your being so grown up...

248
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:29,835
about this, you know?

249
00:11:30,502 --> 00:11:31,663
嘿！
Hey! Yo!

250
00:11:31,795 --> 00:11:32,991
你乘这辆？
You wanna take this one?

251
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,243
-不，你走吧 -确定？
- No, you have it. - You sure?

252
00:11:34,381 --> 00:11:35,577
是，我再叫一辆
Yeah. I'll get the next one.

253
00:11:35,715 --> 00:11:37,124
好，跟你聊天很高兴
All right. Very nice to meet you.

254
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:38,800
-是啊 -以后还会见面的

255
00:11:38,927 --> 00:11:40,717
恩，倒想
Yup. Hope so.

256
00:11:40,845 --> 00:11:43,630
好先生，请到西印度码头

怎么？你不要了？
What? So now you don't want 'em?

288
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,200
我要它干什么？
Why would I want them?

289
00:15:13,294 --> 00:15:14,241
上易趣网卖了

谁想买昨天的票？
Who's gonna wanna buy tickets...

291

293
00:15:18,757 --> 00:15:20,914
整晚都毁了
My whole night was just screwed, man...

294
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:24,049
我在丽碧的新男友面前像个傻蛋
and I looked like a prick in front of Libby's new boyfriend.

295
00:15:24,178 --> 00:15:25,920
她没告诉我她交新男友了
Oh, she didn't tell me she has a new boyfriend.

296
00:15:26,055 --> 00:15:27,168
那人怎么样？
What's he like?

297
00:15:28,223 --> 00:15:29,881
帅，有钱，绅士
Handsome, well-off, friendly.

298
00:15:30,017 --> 00:15:33,016
好像古怪赛车里的完美皮特
He's like Peter Perfect out of Wacky Races...

299
00:15:33,145 --> 00:15:34,388
还跑马拉松
and he runs marathons.

300
00:15:35,898 --> 00:15:37,307
-跑那干嘛？ -就是嘛
- Why? - Exactly.

301
00:15:41,487 --> 00:15:44,486
我惟一一次表白的回应…
Well, look, my only serious relationship ended...

302
00:15:44,615 --> 00:15:46,939
是口吐白沫，抽搐倒地
in a broken collarbone and a dead meerkat...

303
00:15:47,075 --> 00:15:48,983
所以我劝你没什么说服力
so I may not be the best person in the world to give advice...

304
00:15:49,119 --> 00:15:53,494
但你联系了丽碧五年了
but you have been trying to get through to Libby...

305
00:15:51,645 --> 00:15:53,352
for five years now...

306
00:15:53,622 --> 00:15:56,194
也许你该放手了
so maybe you should let her go.

307
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,909
是，她怎么这样呢？
Yeah, but what is her problem?

308
00:15:59,252 --> 00:16:00,661
丹尼斯，你在婚礼上把人甩了
Dennis, you left her at the altar...

309
00:16:00,795 --> 00:16:01,956
怀着孕
when she was pregnant.

310
00:16:02,965 --> 00:16:04,458
那都多少年的事儿了
But that was ages ago.

311
00:16:04,591 --> 00:16:07,507
女人对这些事很在意
Well, women remember that stuff.

312
00:16:08,637 --> 00:16:10,094
如果有什么我能帮忙的
Look, if there's anything else I can do to help...

313
00:16:10,222 --> 00:16:11,928
尽管说
just let me know.

314
00:16:12,057 --> 00:16:14,095
其实，我现在房租还差点
Well, actually, I am a little bit behind in my rent.

315
00:16:14,225 --> 00:16:15,718
你有没有几百块？
I was wondering if you had a couple of hundred quid...

316
00:16:15,852 --> 00:16:17,309
借我一下
I could maybe borrow.

317
00:16:27,488 --> 00:16:28,518
我真喜欢你，真的
Oh, I love you. I really do.

318
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,480
我正需要笑声
I needed that actually.

319
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,772
真好，谢了，回见
That's great. Thank you. I'll see you later.

320
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,196
这个呢？
How about this one?

321
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,366
你肯定做不了
I bet you can't do it.

322
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,420
-我能做大声的 -来啊
- I can do a big one. - Go on.

323
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,540
看，看
Look, look, look, look, look.

324
00:16:56,681 --> 00:16:57,960
这个好
That was a good one.

325
00:16:58,002 --> 00:16:58,997
Yeah.

326
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:00,922
听我说
Listen.

327
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,265
抱歉昨天让你进了警察局
I'm really sorry about gettin' you arrested yesterday.

328
00:17:03,396 --> 00:17:04,343
没关系
That's all right.

329
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,723
现在的大学
Most universities don't even look...

330
00:17:05,856 --> 00:17:07,183
不注意这种记录
at things like that these days.

331
00:17:08,234 --> 00:17:09,513
又来了
Hey, another one.

332
00:17:09,652 --> 00:17:11,310
不知道你还有别的吗？
As far as I'm concerned, what else do you have?

333
00:17:11,445 --> 00:17:13,021
-哦，她很好… -是啊，她
- Oh, she was great. - Yeah, well, she is...

334
00:17:13,058 --> 00:17:14,302
Ooh!

335
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:16,692
-嘘 -抱歉
- Shh. - Sorry.

336
00:17:16,825 --> 00:17:17,772
所以我想…
Um, but, yeah, so I think...

337
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:19,450
想听个秘密吗？
Do you want to hear a secret?

338
00:17:19,578 --> 00:17:20,525
当然了
Absolutely.

339
00:17:20,663 --> 00:17:22,405
我班上有个女生叫艾米丽
There's a girl in my class called Emily.

340
00:17:22,539 --> 00:17:24,281
这应该不是秘密
Well, I'm sure that's not a secret.

341
00:17:24,415 --> 00:17:25,908
老师知道
The teachers probably know about her.

342
00:17:26,042 --> 00:17:27,238
她长得像雨蛙
She looks like a tree frog.

343
00:17:27,376 --> 00:17:28,323
什么？
She what?

344
00:17:28,461 --> 00:17:29,954
长得像雨蛙
She looks like a tree frog.

345
00:17:30,087 --> 00:17:31,959
这么说人家可不好
That's not a very nice thing to say.

346
00:17:32,089 --> 00:17:33,368
我喜欢雨蛙
I like tree frogs.

347
00:17:33,507 --> 00:17:34,585
真的？
Oh, yeah?

348
00:17:34,716 --> 00:17:35,746
胜过霍比特人？
More than hobbits?

349
00:17:38,136 --> 00:17:39,415
这样啊
I see.

350
00:17:39,554 --> 00:17:41,759
我觉得我们可以共度一生
I really feel we can make a life together.

351
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,133
“你觉得我们…”
"You really think we could..."

352
00:17:43,266 --> 00:17:45,138
怎么好像威特的口气
Wait, that sounds like something Whit would say.

353
00:17:45,269 --> 00:17:46,548
他确实说过
He did say it.

354
00:17:46,687 --> 00:17:48,761
-跟谁？你妈？ -是
- What? To Mom? - Yes.

355
00:17:48,897 --> 00:17:50,058
这个猪头
What a shithead.

356
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,137
爸！
Dad!

357
00:17:51,274 --> 00:17:52,304
抱歉
Sorry.

358
00:17:54,861 --> 00:17:56,235
我很高兴你长大了
Listen, I'm really glad you were such a big boy...

359
00:17:56,361 --> 00:17:57,688
不计较…
about not gettin' into the whole...

360
00:17:57,821 --> 00:17:58,982
《指环王》那事了
Lord of the Rings thing, you know?

361
00:17:59,114 --> 00:18:00,061
没关系
That's OK.

362
00:18:00,198 --> 00:18:01,607
威特买了明天前排的票
Whit's got us front row seats for tomorrow...

363
00:18:01,741 --> 00:18:02,819
这回更好
so it's even better.

364
00:18:02,951 --> 00:18:04,408
这个猪头
What a shithead.

365
00:18:04,536 --> 00:18:05,566
爸！
Dad!

366
00:18:05,901 --> 00:18:06,896
Well.

367
00:18:13,117 --> 00:18:14,112
# Ah, yeah #

368
00:18:17,287 --> 00:18:18,282
# Oh, yeah #

369
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,285
# I'm up on the eleventh floor #

370
00:18:22,459 --> 00:18:24,914
# And I'm watchin' the cruisers below #

371
00:18:27,756 --> 00:18:29,036
# He's down on the street #

372
00:18:29,216 --> 00:18:31,885
# And he's tryin' hard to pull sister Flo #

373
00:18:34,471 --> 00:18:36,344
# Oh, my heart's in the basement #

374
00:18:36,514 --> 00:18:39,135
# My weekend's at an all-time low #

375
00:18:41,478 --> 00:18:43,055
# 'Cause she's hopin' to score #

376
00:18:43,229 --> 00:18:45,636
# So I can't see her letting him go #

377
00:18:47,567 --> 00:18:49,144
# You betcha #

378
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:50,599
# Oh, yeah #

379
00:18:51,821 --> 00:18:52,816
# Uh-huh #

380
00:18:59,628 --> 00:19:00,622
要送的货在楼下
Deliveries are downstairs.

381
00:19:00,754 --> 00:19:02,460
-不，我是… -沃特曼・休斯
- No, I'm... - Waterman Hughes.

382
00:19:06,094 --> 00:19:07,635
-何事？ -早(法语)
- Yes? - Bonjour.

383
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,678
威特！
Whit!

384
00:19:16,812 --> 00:19:17,842
多谢帮助
Thanks for your help.

385
00:19:18,981 --> 00:19:20,557
伙计，有何贵干？
So, what brings you down here, man?

386
00:19:20,691 --> 00:19:24,189
高档零售商的高级安全分析实践问题？
A little, uh, high-level security analysis...

387
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:25,397
啊？
in retail operation?

388
00:19:25,528 --> 00:19:27,400
有什么事吗？我正要去健身房
Huh?

389
00:19:25,437 --> 00:19:27,263
What can I do for you? I'm just on my way to the gym.

390
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,854
-我有堂单车课 -啊？
- I got a spin class. - Huh?

391
00:19:29,991 --> 00:19:32,148
单车？就是自行车
Spinning? You know, spinning, bicycles?

392
00:19:32,285 --> 00:19:33,232
哦，对
Oh, OK.

393
00:19:33,369 --> 00:19:35,407
不，我想不如去喝一盅
No, I was thinking more along the lines of a pint.

394
00:19:35,538 --> 00:19:37,280
喝一盅？哦，喝一盅
A pint? Oh, a pint.

395
00:19:37,324 --> 00:19:39,115
Uh, wow.

396
00:19:39,374 --> 00:19:41,116
我也想喝一盅
Um, I'd love a pint, actually...

397
00:19:41,251 --> 00:19:42,660
但我得走了
but, uh, I really gotta hit this class.

398
00:19:42,794 --> 00:19:44,251
我正在训练
I'm in training, you know?

399
00:19:44,379 --> 00:19:45,622
你想来吗？
You wanna come along?

400
00:19:45,755 --> 00:19:47,378
这健身方法不错
Uh, it's an amazing workout.

401
00:19:47,507 --> 00:19:49,498
我想去，但我没服装
I... I'd love to, but I don't have any gear, so...

402
00:19:49,634 --> 00:19:50,712
我借你
Well, I'll lend you some.

403
00:19:51,928 --> 00:19:52,875
好
Great.

404
00:19:53,012 --> 00:19:54,884
三、二、一！
Three, two, one!

405
00:19:55,015 --> 00:19:56,508
我们正在爬坡！节奏上来！
We're climbing! Rhythm is up!

406
00:19:56,641 --> 00:20:00,637
蹬！蹬！
Push! Push! Push! Push!

407
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:02,226
保持紧张！
Keep it up!

408
00:20:02,354 --> 00:20:04,060
别偷懒！来！
No cheating! Let's go!

409
00:20:04,189 --> 00:20:05,516
怎么样？没事吧？
How you doin' there? You all right?

410
00:20:05,649 --> 00:20:06,596
你说什么？
What'd you say?

411
00:20:06,733 --> 00:20:08,771
站起来！爬坡！
Out of the saddle! We're climbing!

412
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,610
用尽全力！
OK, let's make it really hard!

413
00:20:14,657 --> 00:20:16,280
你想跟我谈什么？
So, what did you wanna talk to me about, man?

414
00:20:19,031 --> 00:20:20,229
Ow!

415
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:25,572
杰克说你有《霍比特人》音乐剧的票
Jake said you had some tickets to the, uh...

416
00:20:23,953 --> 00:20:25,447
to the hobbit musical.

417
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,452
是，我的朋友是投资人
Yeah, a friend of mine's an investor in the show.

418
00:20:27,587 --> 00:20:29,543
他非送我不可？你说怪不怪？
He totally hooked me up. Can you believe that?

419
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:32,252
Hmm... um...

420
00:20:32,507 --> 00:20:34,545
我在想…
I was just thinking, um...

421
00:20:34,676 --> 00:20:38,838
你也不愿意坐足三小时看戏吧？
you know, you don't really wanna sit...

422
00:20:35,673 --> 00:20:38,709
through a whole sort of three-hour kind of show, do you?

423
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:42,136
-所以 -其实…
- So... - Well, the thing is...

424
00:20:42,846 --> 00:20:43,841
Oh.

425
00:20:44,852 --> 00:20:47,176
杰克很迷这个
Jake's really kind of got his heart set on this, you know?

426
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:48,343
是啊
Yeah.

427
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,599
-来点粉？ -不用了
- Powder? - I'm fine.

428
00:20:50,733 --> 00:20:51,894
确定？爽身的
You sure? Refreshing.

429
00:20:52,026 --> 00:20:53,649
看得出来
I would imagine it is.

430
00:20:53,778 --> 00:20:56,813
我就是想…你需要的话
I was just... I'm thinkin' maybe, you know, if you like...

431
00:20:56,947 --> 00:20:59,567
我可以替你带杰克和丽碧去
then I could maybe take Jake and Libby for you, you know...

432
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,774
如果你愿意
if... if you want.

433
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:06,866
我知道你对那天票弄砸了很自责
Look, I know you must be kind of angry at yourself...

434
00:21:04,909 --> 00:21:06,735
for messing up with the tickets the other night...

435
00:21:06,997 --> 00:21:08,406
我希望能帮上你
and, uh, I'd like to help you.

436
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,330
真的，但是…
I really would, but, um...

437
00:21:11,793 --> 00:21:12,823
问题是…
Well, the thing is...

438
00:21:12,962 --> 00:21:15,498
我想跟杰克打成一片
I hope to be more and more a part of Jake's life, you know?

439
00:21:15,631 --> 00:21:19,081
说实话，我还挺期待这场演出
And, uh, frankly, I'm kind of looking forward to this show.

440
00:21:19,218 --> 00:21:21,624
可以让我和杰克互相进一步了解
Give Jake and I, a chance to get to know each other better.

441
00:21:21,762 --> 00:21:24,132
我这话儿你了解了吧？
I mean, uh, you can see my point, can't you?

442
00:21:25,182 --> 00:21:26,260
了解了
Yes, I can.

443
00:21:28,518 --> 00:21:29,975
能问个问题吗？
So, can I ask you a question?

444
00:21:30,103 --> 00:21:31,181
好
Sure.

445
00:21:31,312 --> 00:21:33,469
你追到她为什么又放弃了？
You had her once, why did you ever let her go?

446
00:21:33,981 --> 00:21:34,928
说实话，威特
To be honest, Whit...

447
00:21:35,065 --> 00:21:36,973
下楼梯小心点儿
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'd just be careful on the stairs here.

448
00:21:37,108 --> 00:21:38,482
腿可能还硬着
Your legs might be a little rubbery.

449
00:21:39,403 --> 00:21:40,433
我没事儿
I'm fine.

450
00:21:43,741 --> 00:21:45,483
对不起，对不起
Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.

451
00:21:45,617 --> 00:21:46,813
我没事儿…
I'm fine. I'm...

452
00:21:46,952 --> 00:21:50,117
第一阶比较难下…
Yeah, the first step is often the, uh...

453
00:21:49,036 --> 00:21:50,031
the difficult one.

454
00:21:50,997 --> 00:21:52,655
我是丽碧，请留言
This is Libby. Leave me a message.

455
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,865
小丽，是我，给我回个电话
Hey, Lib, it's me. Can you give me a ring?

456
00:22:03,926 --> 00:22:06,166
妈的！
Fuck!

457
00:22:14,352 --> 00:22:15,465
你他娘是谁？
Who the hell are you?

458
00:22:15,603 --> 00:22:17,179
别废话，开门
Just open the bloody door.

459
00:22:17,313 --> 00:22:18,474
好
OK.

460
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:02,433
“丽碧美味糕点店”

461
00:23:04,108 --> 00:23:06,265
-拿好，希望您喜欢 -谢谢

好啊
Hello.

464
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:11,027
丹尼斯，我很忙
Dennis, I'm really busy.

465
00:23:11,155 --> 00:23:12,185
能聊一下吗？
Can we talk?

466
00:23:12,323 --> 00:23:14,397
不，不买就走吧
No, just buy something or go.

467
00:23:14,533 --> 00:23:18,196
我要这个特色纸托蛋糕
OK. I, can I have one of your signature cupcakes, please?

468
00:23:19,496 --> 00:23:20,870
能换成那个大的吗？
Actually, can I have this big one?

469
00:23:20,997 --> 00:23:21,944
-丹尼斯 -那个也行…
- Dennis. - That one's fine...

470
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:23,825
我也喜欢
and, uh, I like that one, too.

471
00:23:25,252 --> 00:23:27,042
-还要什么吗？ -要
- Anything else? - Um, yeah.

472
00:23:27,171 --> 00:23:28,664
你看上威特哪点了？
What do you see in Whit?

473
00:23:28,797 --> 00:23:31,417
-四十九号 -我是四十九号
- Uh, forty-nine. - Yes, I'm forty-nine.

474
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:33,340
-您要什么？ -不，我还没完
- What can I get for you? - No, I'm not done yet.

475
00:23:33,468 --> 00:23:34,581
你完了
Yes, you are.

476
00:23:34,719 --> 00:23:36,876
不好意思，你用完规定时间了
Sorry, I think you've used up your allotted time.

477
00:23:37,013 --> 00:23:39,681
没有什么规定时间好不好？
You don't... You don't have allotted time, OK?

478
00:23:39,806 --> 00:23:41,382
你在占用我的规定时间
Now you're using up my allotted time.

479
00:23:41,516 --> 00:23:43,139
你没有规定时间，好吗？
You don't get allotted time, OK?

480
00:23:43,268 --> 00:23:44,464
又不是竞猜节目
It's not like a game show, you know?

481
00:23:44,602 --> 00:23:47,056
十五秒赢取面包圈什么的
You got, like, fifteen seconds to win a bun.

482
00:23:47,188 --> 00:23:48,894
拜拜，丹尼斯
Goodbye, Dennis.

483
00:23:49,024 --> 00:23:49,971
要什么？
Yes?

484
00:23:50,109 --> 00:23:52,065
你好
Yes. Hello, yes.

485
00:23:52,194 --> 00:23:55,561
你有那种小兔姜饼吗？
Um, do you have any of those little gingerbread rabbits?

486
00:23:55,697 --> 00:23:56,976
没有，那些只在复活节卖
Oh, no. We just have those at Easter.

487
00:23:57,115 --> 00:23:58,193
真抱歉
I'm so sorry.

488
00:23:58,245 --> 00:23:59,240
Oh.

489
00:24:00,456 --> 00:24:01,654
Hmm...

490
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:09,289
有别的动物形状的吗？
Do you have anything else shaped like an animal?

491
00:24:09,417 --> 00:24:10,364
-打扰 -怎么？
- Excuse me. - What?

492
00:24:10,501 --> 00:24:12,457
我还没付钱
I haven't paid for my order.

493
00:24:13,087 --> 00:24:14,081
抱歉
I'm sorry.

494
00:24:14,214 --> 00:24:15,161
借光
- Excuse me. - Yeah.

495
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:16,708
借光
Excuse me.

496
00:24:18,593 --> 00:24:19,872
抱歉
- Ow! - Sorry.

497
00:24:21,429 --> 00:24:22,922
说真的，你看上他哪点？
Seriously, what do you see in him?

498
00:24:23,056 --> 00:24:24,798
他是有钱
OK, he's well-off, all right?

499
00:24:24,932 --> 00:24:26,473
长得不错
He's kind of... He's quite good-looking, you know?

500
00:24:26,601 --> 00:24:27,548
那又怎样？
But I mean, so what?

501
00:24:27,685 --> 00:24:29,178
你认为我是为了这个？
Is that what you think this is about?

502
00:24:29,312 --> 00:24:31,268
傍个帅哥大款？
I just want some gorgeous sugar daddy.

503
00:24:31,397 --> 00:24:32,593
帅倒不至于
I wouldn't say gorgeous.

504
00:24:32,731 --> 00:24:33,927
我才不是看上这些
Well, that's not why I'm with him.

505
00:24:34,066 --> 00:24:35,179
那你看上他什么？
Well, why are you with him?

506
00:24:35,317 --> 00:24:36,395
给我一个理由
You know, give me one good reason.

507
00:24:36,527 --> 00:24:38,435
一个？我可以举五十个
One? I could give you fifty.

508
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:40,775
-我是五十！ -等等
- I'm fifty! - Hang on a minute!

509
00:24:40,906 --> 00:24:44,238
成熟，有责任感，体贴…
He's mature, responsible, considerate...

510
00:24:44,367 --> 00:24:45,610
对杰克好
he's great with Jake.

511
00:24:45,743 --> 00:24:47,651
-这才四个 -嗨
- That's only four. - Hello?

512
00:24:47,787 --> 00:24:50,323
他是个好人，丹尼斯
You know what? He's a good man, Dennis.

513
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:52,992
他为慈善跑马拉松！真是的
You know, he runs marathons for charity, for Pete's sake.

514
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:54,582
那有什么！
Oh, big deal!

515
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,500
你能跑马拉松？
So you could run a marathon?

516
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:58,785
能给我来份果仁巧克力吗？
Could I have a chocolate brownie, please?

517
00:24:58,922 --> 00:25:00,249
等会儿！
- Hang on! - Oh!

518
00:25:00,382 --> 00:25:02,088
丽碧，我可以改
Look, Libby, I can change.

519
00:25:02,217 --> 00:25:04,671
真的？那咱们结婚吧
Yeah? Well, great. Let's get married.

520
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:06,212
-真的？ -不！
- Really? - No!

521
00:25:06,347 --> 00:25:08,303
咱们结过一次，记得吗？
We tried that once, remember?

522
00:25:08,432 --> 00:25:10,802
你在婚礼上跑了，我怀着孩子
You left me at the altar, pregnant.

523
00:25:10,933 --> 00:25:12,342
你个鸡鸡！
You cock!

524
00:25:13,185 --> 00:25:14,642
丽碧，我可以改的，好吗？
Look, Libby, I can change, OK?

525
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:16,678
我已经变了，我可以证明
I have changed. I can prove it.

526
00:25:16,814 --> 00:25:18,188
怎么证明？
How?

527
00:25:20,109 --> 00:25:23,108
我要参加马拉松比赛
I'll tell you. I will run the marathon.

528
00:25:24,988 --> 00:25:26,362
什么？
What?

529
00:25:26,489 --> 00:25:27,436
威特跑的那个
The one that Whit's doin'...

530
00:25:27,574 --> 00:25:29,446
我也跑，跑完全程
I'll run that, and I'll finish it.

531
00:25:29,576 --> 00:25:32,824
算了吧，丹尼斯 你这辈子什么都没干完过
Come on, you've never finished...

532
00:25:30,669 --> 00:25:32,708
anything in your entire life, Dennis.

533
00:25:32,955 --> 00:25:34,993
你看…你…这
Oh, now, you... That's not...

534
00:25:35,123 --> 00:25:36,699
-这个… -看，你连句话都说不全
- You know... - Look, You can't even finish a sentence.

535
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:37,780
别这样…
Don't... don't...

536
00:25:37,918 --> 00:25:39,541
你这是在…那词儿怎么说？
You're just bein', you know, what's the word?

537
00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:40,616
鸡鸡？
Cock?

538
00:25:40,754 --> 00:25:42,828
我决定要鱼的形状的
I would settle for something shaped like a fish.

539
00:25:42,963 --> 00:25:43,910
找卖鱼的去！
Well, go to the fishmonger!

540
00:25:44,047 --> 00:25:45,789
我吃素的
I'm a vegetarian.

541
00:25:45,924 --> 00:25:47,998
好好
OK. OK.

542
00:25:48,134 --> 00:25:49,627
丹尼斯，请你走吧
Dennis, just please leave.

543
00:25:49,761 --> 00:25:52,001
好，我走
OK. OK, I'll go.

544
00:25:52,138 --> 00:25:53,512
但我会证明给你看的，丽碧
But I'm gonna prove this to you, Libby.

545
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,888
我也可以成熟，担待，体贴
I can be mature, considerate, and responsible.

546
00:25:58,937 --> 00:26:00,015
丹尼斯？
- Oh! - Dennis?

547
00:26:00,147 --> 00:26:01,260
什么，丽碧？
Yes, Libby?

548
00:26:02,691 --> 00:26:04,232
两英镑，七十五分
It's two pounds, seventy-five.

549
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:05,852
哦，对了
Oh, yeah, right.

550
00:26:07,362 --> 00:26:08,903
丹尼斯想跑就可以跑
Hey, if Dennis thinks he can run the race...

551
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,024
他能跑下来的
he can run the race.

552
00:26:10,156 --> 00:26:11,483
-谢谢 -不可能
- Thank you. - There's no way

553
00:26:11,616 --> 00:26:13,157
你跑马拉松？
you can run a marathon.

554
00:26:13,283 --> 00:26:15,819
-怎么不能？ -因为你是个懒蛋
- Why not? - 'Cause you is a lazy bastard.

555
00:26:15,952 --> 00:26:17,908
告诉你，我还参加单车课了呢
Hey, I'll have you know I go to spin classes.

556
00:26:18,037 --> 00:26:19,613
去了一次
You went to one.

557
00:26:19,747 --> 00:26:22,497
就弄得像约翰・韦恩一样 (其走路姿势独特)
Yeah, and now you walk like John Wayne.

558
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,159
嘿，这事对我很重要
Hey, this is important to me.

559
00:26:25,462 --> 00:26:26,705
我说真的！
I mean it!

560
00:26:26,838 --> 00:26:30,881
好了，我受够了做半吊子的男人
Look, I'm sick of being a nearly man, all right?

561
00:26:31,009 --> 00:26:31,956
我受够了担惊受怕
I'm sick of being scared.

562
00:26:32,093 --> 00:26:33,372
受够了每天的自责
I'm sick of the regret I feel every day...

563
00:26:33,511 --> 00:26:35,716
因为我没种娶我爱的女人！
'cause I didn't have the guts to marry the woman I love!

564
00:26:37,473 --> 00:26:39,429
明天六点这些统统结束！
All that ends tomorrow at 6 A.M.

565
00:27:17,899 --> 00:27:19,725
# Ow! #

566
00:27:41,241 --> 00:27:42,271
不错
Not bad.

567
00:27:59,215 --> 00:28:00,245
嗨
Hi.

568
00:28:02,385 --> 00:28:03,498
好点了？
Feel better?

569
00:28:03,636 --> 00:28:05,045
好多了
Much.

570
00:28:05,179 --> 00:28:07,253
单车课如何？
Oh, how was spin class?

571
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,589
很棒的健身方式
Uh, it was... It was an amazing workout.

572
00:28:12,812 --> 00:28:14,139
是吗？
Is that right?

573
00:28:14,272 --> 00:28:15,729
是的，而且我觉得…
Yeah. And I also thought it would be...

574
00:28:15,857 --> 00:28:19,438
可以让我和威特互相了解
a good chance for me to get to know Whit...

575
00:28:17,749 --> 00:28:19,326
a little bit better, so...

576
00:28:19,567 --> 00:28:21,641
那我们可以一起吃顿饭
Well, maybe we should all go out for dinner then.

577
00:28:21,778 --> 00:28:22,891
-真的？ -是啊
- You think? - Yeah.

578
00:28:23,029 --> 00:28:24,687
然后一起去跳舞
And then we could go dancing.

579
00:28:24,822 --> 00:28:26,694
-你开玩笑 -不，没开玩笑
- You're jokin'. - No, not at all.

580
00:28:26,824 --> 00:28:29,230
之后我们可以一起回来
And then, afterwards, we could come back here...

581
00:28:29,368 --> 00:28:30,564
来三人行
and have a threesome.

582
00:28:32,329 --> 00:28:33,572
你开玩笑
Oh. You are joking.

583
00:28:33,706 --> 00:28:34,902
当然！
Of course, I am.

584
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:37,577
丹尼斯，我不知道你想干什么 但不管是什么目的…
Look, Dennis, I don't know what's going on...

585
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,286
-我不希望你这样 -我…没有…
in that head of yours, but whatever it is...

586
00:28:37,643 --> 00:28:39,185
- I don't like it. - I've... There's nothing...

587
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,126
-爸！ -嘿，伙计
- Daddy! - Hey, buddy.

588
00:28:41,255 --> 00:28:42,249
-准备好上学了？ -恩
- You ready for school? - Yeah.

589
00:28:42,381 --> 00:28:44,419
等下，等下
Wait up, wait up, wait up a sec.

590
00:28:46,593 --> 00:28:47,836
咱们一起走好吗？
Can I walk with you guys?

591
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:49,000
好
OK.

592
00:28:50,221 --> 00:28:51,595
-回头见 -好
- I'll see you later. - OK.

593
00:28:53,641 --> 00:28:54,671
-拜 -拜拜
- Bye. - Bye-bye.

594
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:56,637
可以走了？
All right, you ready?

595
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:57,798
恩
Yeah.

596
00:29:05,027 --> 00:29:08,608
威特，你来得很早啊？
So, Whit, you were, uh, 'round at Libby's pretty early, eh?

597
00:29:08,739 --> 00:29:10,280
威特昨晚在这儿住的
Whit stayed over last night.

598
00:29:10,407 --> 00:29:11,603
-哦？ -是的
- Oh? - Yes.

599
00:29:11,742 --> 00:29:12,855
他们还玩跳床来着
They were jumping on the bed.

600
00:29:14,137 --> 00:29:15,132
Wow.

601
00:29:17,414 --> 00:29:20,497
知道吗，杰儿，我问朋友了
Hey, Jakey, guess what? Uh, I spoke to my friend...

602
00:29:20,624 --> 00:29:22,615
他确实还有一张今晚的票
and he does have an extra ticket for the show tonight.

603
00:29:22,751 --> 00:29:25,287
咱们带上艾米丽如何？
What do you say we, uh, ask Emily to come along?

604
00:29:25,421 --> 00:29:26,830
好耶！
Yeah!

605
00:29:26,964 --> 00:29:28,836
他告诉你艾米丽的事了？
- Yay. - What, he told you about Emily?

606
00:29:28,966 --> 00:29:29,996
是呀
Oh, yeah.

607
00:29:32,427 --> 00:29:35,343
听丽碧说你要跑马拉松？
Oh, and, uh...

608
00:29:32,364 --> 00:29:35,234
Libby tells me that you decided to run the marathon?

609
00:29:35,472 --> 00:29:36,466
是的
Yeah.

610
00:29:36,598 --> 00:29:38,803
那太好了，真的
That's great, man. Seriously.

611
00:29:38,933 --> 00:29:40,129
真的，很棒
Really, that's awesome.

612
00:29:40,268 --> 00:29:41,346
谢谢
Thank you.

613
00:29:41,477 --> 00:29:42,424
你怎么报上的？
How did you manage to get in?

614
00:29:42,562 --> 00:29:43,509
什么意思？
What do you mean?

615
00:29:43,646 --> 00:29:45,139
你不能上去就跑
Well, you can't just show up and run.

616
00:29:45,273 --> 00:29:46,220
怎么？
Well, why not?

617
00:29:46,357 --> 00:29:47,636
你要提前申请
You have to apply in advance.

618
00:29:48,651 --> 00:29:49,681
提前多久？
Well, how far in advance?

619
00:29:49,819 --> 00:29:51,228
三个月？
Uh, three months.

620
00:29:51,362 --> 00:29:52,309
比赛还有多久？
And when is it again?

621
00:29:52,446 --> 00:29:53,820
三个星期
Three weeks.

622
00:29:53,947 --> 00:29:54,894
好
Right.

623
00:29:55,032 --> 00:29:58,695
有时会为慈善事业的选手破例，但是…
They'll make exceptions sometimes...

624
00:29:56,345 --> 00:29:58,586
if you're running for a charity, but, uh, you know...

625
00:29:58,827 --> 00:30:01,530
每类慈善事业的名额有限
each charity is only allowed a certain amount of runners.

626
00:30:01,663 --> 00:30:03,072
你不用担心我
No, you don't have to worry about me.

627
00:30:03,206 --> 00:30:04,319
我能报上的
I'll get in.

628
00:30:04,457 --> 00:30:05,736
好
All right.

629
00:30:05,875 --> 00:30:07,949
你以前跑过马拉松？
You ever, uh, run a marathon before?

630
00:30:08,085 --> 00:30:09,281
没有，怎么？
No. Why?

631
00:30:10,379 --> 00:30:11,540
很累的
It's pretty gruelling.

632
00:30:11,672 --> 00:30:13,996
是啊，所以才叫马拉松
Well, yeah, that's why they call it a marathon.

633
00:30:15,634 --> 00:30:17,590
实际上叫马拉松…
Yeah, actually, technically, it's called a marathon...

634
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,126
是因为公元前490年的事件
because of the events of 490 B.C.

635
00:30:20,264 --> 00:30:21,721
有一位希腊战士…
There was a Greek soldier...

636
00:30:21,849 --> 00:30:23,425
-叫斐… -能不能打断一下
- named Phei... - Say, can I just...

637
00:30:23,516 --> 00:30:24,463
什么
- stop you there? - Yeah.

638
00:30:25,477 --> 00:30:27,433
没什么，就是打断
I've got have nothing to say. I just wanted to stop you there.

639
00:30:32,858 --> 00:30:34,399
好
All right, all right.

640
00:30:35,611 --> 00:30:37,816
你好，是猫儿保护联盟吗？
Hello. Is that the Cats Protection League?

641
00:30:38,781 --> 00:30:39,728
你好，我想…
Hello. I was just...

642
00:30:39,865 --> 00:30:41,108
参加这个月的马拉松比赛
I'm... I'm running a marathon next month...

643
00:30:41,241 --> 00:30:43,066
不知能否代表你们出赛？
and I was wondering if I could possibly run on your behalf?

644
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:46,408
好，很好
Great. Yeah, yeah.

645
00:30:46,539 --> 00:30:48,696
可以
OK. I see.

646
00:30:50,292 --> 00:30:51,619
那服装多大？
How big is the costume?

647
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,828
好，回头打给你
OK. I'll call you back.

648
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:57,982
Ooh.

649
00:30:58,215 --> 00:30:59,245
嗨
Hi.

650
00:31:00,342 --> 00:31:01,585
-丹尼斯 -怎么？
- Dennis. - Oh, yes?

651
00:31:01,718 --> 00:31:03,543
能不能别在顾客面前这样
Would you mind not doing that in front of the customers?

652
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,753
抱歉，我早上穿裤衩去跑步
Sorry. I went for a run this morning in my trunks...

653
00:31:05,889 --> 00:31:07,512
可能起痱子了
and I think I've got a bit of a rash...

654
00:31:07,641 --> 00:31:09,299
正好在…
you know, down there in the, uh...

655
00:31:09,435 --> 00:31:11,093
-明白 -阴囊部位
- I understand. - Scrotal zone.

656
00:31:11,228 --> 00:31:13,219
-我明白，丹尼斯 -好
- I understand, Dennis. - OK.

657
00:31:13,355 --> 00:31:17,221
工作时间不要把手放在阴囊部位
Please, keep your hands out of the scrotal zone...

658
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:18,437
好
whilst you're at work.

659
00:31:17,299 --> 00:31:18,330
Will do.

660
00:31:56,644 --> 00:31:57,674
嘘
Shh.

661
00:31:58,938 --> 00:32:00,051
丹尼斯！
Dennis!

662
00:32:02,651 --> 00:32:03,681
对不起，我…
Sorry. I was, um...

663
00:32:05,445 --> 00:32:06,475
我到位了
I was in the zone.

664
00:32:09,741 --> 00:32:12,859
打扮成大脑？
So, um, I'd actually be dressed as a brain.

665
00:32:12,994 --> 00:32:15,199
再联系好吗？
Um, can I call you back?

666
00:32:24,755 --> 00:32:26,876
#你想得倒是轻松#
# Just 'cause you think it #

667
00:32:27,007 --> 00:32:29,247
#哪有这种好事#
# It don't make it so #

668
00:32:29,384 --> 00:32:32,004
#喝个烂醉如泥#
# Drive you to drink #

669
00:32:32,136 --> 00:32:34,625
#结果还是做梦#
# Won't let you go #

670
00:32:34,764 --> 00:32:38,974
#恋爱中的姑娘小伙#
# Plenty of girls and boys in love #

671
00:32:39,101 --> 00:32:40,048
大哥呀！
Come on!

672
00:32:40,186 --> 00:32:45,558
#姑娘小伙在恋爱中#
# Plenty of girls #

673
00:32:43,675 --> 00:32:45,466
# And boys in love #

674
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:51,066
想喝杯茶吗，丹尼斯？
Would you like a cup of tea, Dennis?

675
00:32:55,784 --> 00:32:57,775
就是这样
So that's it.

676
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:59,189
跑马拉松是我最后的机会
Running this marathon could be my last chance...

677
00:32:59,328 --> 00:33:00,951
向丽碧证明我变了
to show Libby that I can change.

678
00:33:04,487 --> 00:33:05,566
Mmm.

679
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:10,040
知道换我会怎么做吗？
You know what I would do if I were you?

680
00:33:10,172 --> 00:33:11,119
怎么？
What?

681
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:13,626
找点皮疹膏
I would get some cream for that rash.

682
00:33:15,468 --> 00:33:17,506
问你个事，丹尼斯
Let me ask you something, Dennis.

683
00:33:17,637 --> 00:33:21,585
你为什么在婚礼上丢下怀孕的妻子？
Why did you leave your lady at the altar when she was pregnant?

684
00:33:21,725 --> 00:33:23,004
不清楚，就是没准备好
I don't know. Just wasn't ready.

685
00:33:25,353 --> 00:33:29,894
大米饭都熟了，朋友
The toothpaste was already out of the tube, my friend.

686
00:33:30,649 --> 00:33:32,889
跟准备好有什么关系？
Being ready had nothing to do with it.

687
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:35,646
我害怕
I was scared.

688
00:33:35,726 --> 00:33:36,721
Mmm.

689
00:33:38,031 --> 00:33:39,488
这么说你是个懦夫
So, you are a coward.

690
00:33:40,742 --> 00:33:42,365
我以为就喝茶随便聊聊
I thought we were just gonna have a cup of tea.

691
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:46,445
你认为你不够好
You did not think you were good enough.

692
00:33:48,667 --> 00:33:50,041
对不对？
Am I right?

693
00:33:50,168 --> 00:33:52,242
你想到妻子，害怕…
You thought of your lady, and you were terrified...

694
00:33:52,378 --> 00:33:55,330
你无法给她应得的一切
you could not give her what she needed...

695
00:33:53,952 --> 00:33:55,232
what she deserved.

696
00:33:57,341 --> 00:33:58,964
我以前也有这个想法
I thought the same things...

697
00:33:59,093 --> 00:34:02,128
跟古施达施迪达赫夫人结婚的时候
on the day I married Mrs Ghoshdashtidar.

698
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:04,960
愿她安息
May she rest.

699
00:34:06,807 --> 00:34:08,181
你也是？
Did you?

700
00:34:08,309 --> 00:34:10,099
是，但猜怎么着？
Yes. But guess what?

701
00:34:10,228 --> 00:34:13,263
最后证明我足够好
It turned out I was good enough.

702
00:34:13,398 --> 00:34:15,104
我努力做到够好
I made myself good enough.

703
00:34:16,776 --> 00:34:18,566
你是做错了，丹尼斯
You did a stupid thing, Dennis.

704
00:34:19,153 --> 00:34:23,398
但她爱过你，那毕竟是你赢来的
But she loved you once, and you must have earned that somehow.

705
00:34:26,827 --> 00:34:28,154
是啊
Yeah.

706
00:34:29,621 --> 00:34:32,537
你的婚姻幸福吗，古施达施迪达赫先生？
Did you have a good marriage, Mr Ghoshdashtidar?

707
00:34:32,615 --> 00:34:33,859
Ah.

708
00:34:36,127 --> 00:34:38,699
我记得那种合二为一的感觉…
I remember the feeling of being complete...

709
00:34:39,505 --> 00:34:43,999
每天都像和最好的朋友一起度过…
of spending every day with my best friend...

710
00:34:44,135 --> 00:34:45,509
而最幸福的…
but most of all...

711
00:34:48,055 --> 00:34:51,505
是我记得所有的性交…
I remember all the fucking.

712
00:34:56,305 --> 00:34:57,633
Mmm...

713
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,094
Mmm...

714
00:35:04,654 --> 00:35:06,811
右舷转向三度，船长
Oh, three degrees starboard, skipper.

715
00:35:06,947 --> 00:35:08,440
嘿，我是船长
Hey, I'm the captain.

716
00:35:08,574 --> 00:35:11,407
兵变夺船！
Mutiny! Mutiny!

717
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,608
Whoa!

718
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:17,402
来啦，小伙子
Ahoy there, me lad.

719
00:35:19,084 --> 00:35:20,826
-噢 -嘿，杰儿
- Oh! - Hey, Jakey.

720
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,907
抱歉迟到了，宝贝
Sorry, we're late, love.

721
00:35:22,045 --> 00:35:23,586
威特知道要来这儿
Soon as Whit found out we we're meeting here...

722
00:35:23,713 --> 00:35:25,122
非拿他的船来不可
he had to go get his vessel.

723
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,249
杰儿，拨这个开关
Jakey, here. Flip that switch.

724
00:35:27,383 --> 00:35:29,504
不，是这个
No, not that one. That one.

725
00:35:32,514 --> 00:35:34,172
哇！我能开吗？
Whoa! Can I steer it?

726
00:35:34,306 --> 00:35:36,131
不行，但你可以看我开
No. But you can watch me steer it.

727
00:35:37,184 --> 00:35:38,214
兵变
Mutiny.

728
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,434
能来下吗？
Hey. You wanna?

729
00:35:43,565 --> 00:35:45,390
-他还乖吗？ -很乖
- Was he OK? - Yeah, he's fine.

730
00:35:45,525 --> 00:35:48,939
我们玩得很好 要不是布莱船长出现的话
We had a really nice time until Captain Bligh turned up.

731
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:51,108
威特干什么都很认真
Whit just likes to take things very seriously.

732
00:35:51,238 --> 00:35:56,479
要么投降，要么就尝尝女王陛下 皇家舰队齐射的怒火吧！
Prepare to be boarded, or feel the hot wrath...

733
00:35:53,861 --> 00:35:56,398
of Her Majesty's royal fusillade!

734
00:35:58,204 --> 00:35:59,447
等等，别碰那个
Wait, don't touch that. Wait.

735
00:36:00,832 --> 00:36:02,241
我为什么不能开？
Why won't you let me steer it?

736
00:36:02,375 --> 00:36:04,117
因为船是我的
Uh, because it's mine.

737
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,577
你还要跑马拉松？
So, you're still gonna run in this marathon?

738
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:06,788
当然，必须的
Yes, absolutely.

739
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,413
一定很好的
It's gonna be great.

740
00:36:08,546 --> 00:36:10,371
你将看到全新的丹尼斯
You're gonna see a whole new Dennis.

741
00:36:10,506 --> 00:36:11,785
好，我考虑过这件事
Right, well, I've been thinking about it...

742
00:36:11,924 --> 00:36:14,164
我觉得，我不关心
and the thing is, I don't care.

743
00:36:14,301 --> 00:36:15,497
什么意思？
What do you mean?

744
00:36:15,636 --> 00:36:17,710
丹尼斯，你认为你会获得什么？
Dennis, what do you think you're going to achieve?

745
00:36:17,846 --> 00:36:20,003
你真觉得跑上二十六里路
Do you honestly think that running 26 miles...

746
00:36:20,141 --> 00:36:21,634
就洗心革面了？
is just gonna wipe the slate clean?

747
00:36:21,768 --> 00:36:24,055
也许穿短裤跑可以
Well, you might change your mind when you see me...

748
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:23,968
in jogging shorts.

749
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:31,639
过几周威特要为我办生日宴会…
Look, Whit's having a birthday party...

750
00:36:31,777 --> 00:36:34,480
你来的话，杰克会很高兴
for me in a couple of weeks...

751
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:34,401
and it would mean a lot to Jake if you came.

752
00:36:34,613 --> 00:36:35,643
只为杰克？
To Jake?

753
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:38,482
Hey!

754
00:36:40,574 --> 00:36:41,569
Hey!

755
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,314
Hey!

756
00:36:45,622 --> 00:36:46,616
谁的船？
Hey, OK.

757
00:36:46,749 --> 00:36:49,203
谁的船？
Whose boat is this?

758
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:49,112
Whose boat... is this?!

759
00:36:49,335 --> 00:36:52,287
有人吗，这是谁的船？
Excuse me! Is... Is this your boat?!

760
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:55,664
-不可能！ -他是个废物
- No way! - He's toast.

761
00:36:55,799 --> 00:36:56,829
坚持不下来的
He won't last.

762
00:37:02,847 --> 00:37:04,008
来点比萨？丹尼斯？
Would you like some pizza, Dennis?

763
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,048
好，非常感谢
Oh. Yes, I would actually. Thank you very much.

764
00:37:06,184 --> 00:37:07,131
过来
- Ow! - Come here.

765
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:09,424
你干什么，别打我
What are you doing that... Stop it.

766
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,467
你还跑吗？
Are you still gonna do this?

767
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:12,717
你还跑马拉松吗？
Are you still gonna run the marathon?

768
00:37:12,857 --> 00:37:13,887
想跑
I want to, yes.

769
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:15,054
感谢上帝
Thank God.

770
00:37:17,236 --> 00:37:18,183
怎么？
Why?

771
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,560
因为我把钱都压上了
Because I just bet them every penny I have.

772
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:22,238
什么？你压我了？
What? You bet on me?

773
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,353
丹尼斯，你是我最好的朋友
Dennis, you're my best friend.

774
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,282
我当然压你
I'm not gonna bet against you.

775
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:28,369
谢谢
Well, thank you.

776
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:29,870
赔率这么高
Not with these odds.

777
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:31,659
我跑不完怎么办？
Well, what if I don't finish?

778
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,533
文森特会杀了你
Vincent'll kill you.

779
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:34,781
你能跑完的
Oh, you'll finish.

780
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,246
你怎么这么确定？
How can you be so sure?

781
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:44,840
起来！起来！起来！
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!

782
00:37:47,347 --> 00:37:49,172
你是我的教练
So, you're gonna be my coach.

783
00:37:49,307 --> 00:37:50,681
对
That's right.

784
00:37:50,808 --> 00:37:51,755
你又来干嘛？
Why are you here?

785
00:37:51,893 --> 00:37:54,180
我是助理教练
I'm the assistant coach.

786
00:37:54,312 --> 00:37:55,306
你凭什么当助理教练？
Why do you get to be assistant coach?

787
00:37:55,438 --> 00:37:57,014
凭这把平铲
Because I have this spatula.

788
00:37:57,107 --> 00:37:58,102
Ow!

789
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:00,847
快，跑
Go on. Get running.

790
00:38:00,984 --> 00:38:03,189
有什么特殊的技巧吗？
Wait. Isn't there some sort of special technique?

791
00:38:04,405 --> 00:38:05,981
有，把一只脚放另一只前…
Yeah, you put one leg in front of the other...

792
00:38:06,115 --> 00:38:08,153
快速反复交替
over and over again really fast.

793
00:38:09,492 --> 00:38:10,570
你来干什么来着？
Why are you here again?

794
00:38:10,702 --> 00:38:12,195
鞭策
- Ow! - Motivation.

795
00:38:12,288 --> 00:38:13,865
# I said, yeah #

796
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,320
# I said, yeah #

797
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,990
- # What they said # - # What they said #

798
00:38:18,209 --> 00:38:19,618
膝盖抬高！
- # Oh, I said, yeah # - Lift your knees higher!

799
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,701
你这样跑不动的
- You're not gonna get... - # Yeah, yeah #

800
00:38:20,796 --> 00:38:22,373
- anywhere like that! - # It's what they said #

801
00:38:22,548 --> 00:38:24,339
- You've gotta slide more. - # What they said #

802
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:27,081
快，丹尼斯
- # Do you believe I would take something with me # - Come on, Dennis!

803
00:38:27,217 --> 00:38:29,125
想尝尝我的平铲？
- You want to feel my spatula?! - # And give it #

804
00:38:29,261 --> 00:38:30,635
不想
- No, I do not! - # To the police man? #

805
00:38:30,763 --> 00:38:33,431
那就跑，像风一样！
- Then run! Run like the wind! - # I wouldn't do that #

806
00:38:34,099 --> 00:38:37,051
我也挺累的
- # And if I do that # - This is harder...

807
00:38:35,269 --> 00:38:36,976
- # I would say, "Sir" # - for me, you know?

808
00:38:37,146 --> 00:38:38,521
# "Come on and put the charge on me" #

809
00:38:38,689 --> 00:38:40,147
Ow!

810
00:38:40,316 --> 00:38:41,975
# I wouldn't do that #

811
00:38:42,189 --> 00:38:45,437
快，丹尼斯！ 快！
- # No, I wouldn't do that # - Come on, Dennis! Come on!

812
00:38:45,567 --> 00:38:48,187
情况不错
- Lookin' good! Lookin' good! - # I'm not a fool to hurt myself #

813
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,813
保持住，丹尼斯
- Come on, Dennis. Keep up the pace. - # I was innocent #

814
00:38:49,946 --> 00:38:52,103
等等，等等
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. - # Of what they done to me #

815
00:38:52,202 --> 00:38:54,075
# They was wrong #

816
00:38:54,284 --> 00:38:55,231
脚好像起泡了
I think I got a blister.

817
00:38:55,369 --> 00:38:56,363
好
- # They were wrong # - OK.

818
00:38:56,495 --> 00:38:57,738
轻点
Yeah, gently.

819
00:38:57,871 --> 00:38:58,901
好
All right.

820
00:39:00,916 --> 00:39:03,832
噢，好的
OK! Oh! All right.

821
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,666
-很糟吗？ -不，不糟
- Is it bad? - No, it's not that bad.

822
00:39:05,795 --> 00:39:07,336
不，不糟
No. No. It's not.

823
00:39:08,506 --> 00:39:10,793
好大
Ohh! Oh, that's big.

824
00:39:13,343 --> 00:39:14,884
看看
Look at that thing.

825
00:39:15,011 --> 00:39:16,504
就像子宫一样
It's like a womb.

826
00:39:17,222 --> 00:39:18,300
别碰
Don't.

827
00:39:18,431 --> 00:39:19,378
也许里面住着小人
Hey, maybe there's a little man in there...

828
00:39:19,516 --> 00:39:21,341
长得和你一样，跑的比你快
who looks just like you, but he's really good at running.

829
00:39:21,477 --> 00:39:22,934
你说什么呢？
What are you talking about?!

830
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:24,222
只是个念头
It's just a thought.

831
00:39:24,354 --> 00:39:25,515
你来弄破
You're gonna have to pop it.

832
00:39:27,649 --> 00:39:29,023
我不
No. No way.

833
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,643
我不挤别人的脓
Never pop another man's pustule.

834
00:39:30,777 --> 00:39:32,318
那我来，给我针
Well, I'll do it then. Give me the needle.

835
00:39:32,445 --> 00:39:33,724
这是能找到最小的
That's the closest I could get.

836
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:36,603
没事儿，消毒了
It's fine. I sterilized it.

837
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:37,771
用什么消的？
In what?

838
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:41,071
消毒了
It's sterilized.

839
00:39:42,579 --> 00:39:44,155
好，来了
OK, OK. Here we go.

840
00:39:48,502 --> 00:39:49,580
你能做到
Ooh, you're gonna get it.

841
00:39:50,962 --> 00:39:52,371
忍住
Stick it in.

842
00:39:52,505 --> 00:39:53,666
-扎！ -我不行
- Pop it! - I can't!

843
00:39:53,798 --> 00:39:55,255
-为什么？ -我害怕
- Why not? - It's scary!

844
00:39:55,383 --> 00:39:56,626
给我
Give it to me.

845
00:39:56,759 --> 00:39:57,706
慢慢的！
Just do it slow!

846
00:39:57,844 --> 00:39:58,874
-轻轻的，好吗？ -好
- Do it... Do it gently, OK? - Yeah.

847
00:39:59,011 --> 00:40:00,504
-相信我 -数三个数，好吗？
- Trust me. - After three, OK?

848
00:40:00,638 --> 00:40:01,751
-好 -一
- OK. - One.

849
00:40:06,435 --> 00:40:07,465
插进去了！
It's in it!

850
00:40:08,103 --> 00:40:09,809
拔出来！
Get it out!

851
00:40:09,938 --> 00:40:11,431
快他娘拔出来！
Bloody take it out!

852
00:40:11,565 --> 00:40:12,939
-别动！别动！ -拔！
- Hold still! Hold still! - Get it!

853
00:40:21,074 --> 00:40:22,104
真抱歉
I'm so sorry.

854
00:40:22,992 --> 00:40:24,366
尚无先例
That's never happened before.

855
00:40:24,459 --> 00:40:25,787
Oh! Oh!

856
00:40:29,206 --> 00:40:30,319
我是天主教徒
I'm Catholic.

857
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,833
这是我眼睛里进过的第二恶心的液体
That was the second most disgusting fluid...

858
00:40:33,551 --> 00:40:34,749
I've ever had in my eye.

859
00:40:36,338 --> 00:40:37,499
谁？
Who's that?

860
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:38,624
古先生
That's Mr G.

861
00:40:38,757 --> 00:40:40,463
打扮像样点
Get something nice on, something respectable.

862
00:40:40,593 --> 00:40:41,623
去哪儿？
Where we goin'?

863
00:41:02,195 --> 00:41:04,269
每年都有近千人
Every year, literally hundreds of people...

864
00:41:04,405 --> 00:41:07,819
受神经脑皮层损伤的折磨

00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:42,231

I hope you don't have it, 'cause I don't have a receipt...

994
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,268
因为不是买的…

卫生间在哪？
It's OK. Where's the toilet?

997
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:54,325
我领你去，你招待一下丹尼斯
I'll show you, and, uh, you can entertain Dennis.

好
OK.

999
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,909
只要他不介意跟混蛋在一起
That is if he doesn't mind hangin' out with an asshole.

1000
00:47:59,417 --> 00:48:01,242
他说着玩的，我没说你是混蛋
He was joking. I never said you were an asshole.

1006
00:48:11,595 --> 00:48:13,136
就像脱销了一般
just like you got him out of a catalogue.

1007
00:48:13,264 --> 00:48:14,377
怎么理解？
And what's your point?

1008
00:48:14,515 --> 00:48:16,921
我上次买了一双畅销鞋
I ordered a pair of shoes once from a catalogue.

1009
00:48:17,059 --> 00:48:19,097
上好的意大利软皮洛夫鞋
Gorgeous soft leather Italian loafers.

1010
00:48:19,227 --> 00:48:20,388
看着好极了，结果收到货
They looked amazing, but then they arrived...

1011
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,594
穿上像踩地雷似的
and I put them on, and they hurt like fuck.

1012
00:48:22,731 --> 00:48:23,974
谢了，我记住了
Thanks. I'll bear that in mind.

1013
00:48:24,803 --> 00:48:26,261
Wow.

1014
00:48:26,443 --> 00:48:28,399
我在这儿洗个澡会不会很怪？
Hey, do you think it would be weird if I took a bath?

1015
00:48:31,656 --> 00:48:33,398
是很怪
Yeah, that would be weird.

1016
00:48:35,743 --> 00:48:37,699
-给 -谢了
- Hey. - Hey.

1017
00:48:36,231 --> 00:48:37,641
- Here you go. - Oh, thanks.

1018
00:48:37,828 --> 00:48:39,071
干杯
Cheers.

1019
00:48:39,204 --> 00:48:40,234
干杯
Cheers.

1020
00:48:42,624 --> 00:48:43,998
你觉得怎么样？
What do you think?

1021
00:48:44,125 --> 00:48:46,163
有人往你车上撒尿
I think I see a guy peeing on your car.

1022
00:48:46,294 --> 00:48:47,324
-什么？ -骗到你了
- What? - Got you.

1023
00:48:48,505 --> 00:48:50,543
哦，厉害
Oh, very good.

1024
00:48:50,673 --> 00:48:52,629
看到哪儿了吗？
Actually, you see that?

1025
00:48:52,759 --> 00:48:53,706
什么？
What?

1026
00:48:53,844 --> 00:48:55,502
那儿，圣・保罗大教堂
There. I'm talking about St. Paul's Cathedral.

1027
00:48:55,637 --> 00:48:56,916
-看见了？ -呃…
- You see it? - Uh-huh.

1028
00:48:57,055 --> 00:48:58,631
目前是我最喜欢的伦敦景点
Currently my favourite spot in London.

1029
00:48:58,765 --> 00:48:59,878
知道为什么吗？
You know why?

1030
00:49:00,016 --> 00:49:02,090
因为你在那里第一次…
Uh, is it because that's where you first realized...

1031
00:49:02,226 --> 00:49:03,387
发现自己很出色？
how amazing you are?

1032
00:49:04,936 --> 00:49:06,808
那里是马拉松的终点
It's the finish line for the marathon.

1033
00:49:07,439 --> 00:49:09,015
再有两天，我就会穿过那儿
Only two more days, and I get to cross it.

1034
00:49:09,149 --> 00:49:10,096
真等不及了
Can't wait.

1035
00:49:10,233 --> 00:49:11,726
我也是
Me, too.

1036
00:49:11,818 --> 00:49:13,939
成功跑完长跑是世上最棒的事
Greatest feeling in the world, finishing a distance race.

1037
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:16,275
你肯定会跑得很开心
I think you're really gonna get a kick out of it.

1038
00:49:16,405 --> 00:49:17,601
你觉得我跑不完，是不？
You don't think I'm gonna finish, do you?

1039
00:49:17,741 --> 00:49:18,735
是的
No, I don't.

1040
00:49:18,867 --> 00:49:19,814
为什么？
Why not?

1041
00:49:19,951 --> 00:49:21,693
因为那很难，丹尼斯
'Cause it's really hard, Dennis.

1042
00:49:21,828 --> 00:49:23,107
需要一些…
Actually requires a couple of things...

1043
00:49:23,246 --> 00:49:26,115
抱歉，你没有的东西
that, uh, forgive me, but you don't seem to possess.

1044
00:49:26,249 --> 00:49:29,201
不好意思，我正好有一双很棒的跑鞋
I happen to have a very nice pair...

1045
00:49:27,615 --> 00:49:29,157
of running shoes now, thank you very much.

1046
00:49:30,795 --> 00:49:33,545
我是说方法和坚持
I'm talking about discipline and perseverance.

1047
00:49:33,671 --> 00:49:35,828
且不说别的
And all cute little comments aside...

1048
00:49:36,632 --> 00:49:37,911
赛程中总有那么一点…
there comes a point in every race...

1049
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:39,792
可能是十五里，可能二十五
it could be the fifth mile, it could be the 25th...

1050
00:49:39,927 --> 00:49:41,384
你会撞上…
but, eventually, you're gonna hit...

1051
00:49:41,512 --> 00:49:43,337
赛手们说的那堵“墙”
what runners like to call "the wall."

1052
00:49:43,472 --> 00:49:44,751
到时候…
And when you do...

1053
00:49:44,891 --> 00:49:47,559
你会喘不上气，脑子一片空白 挪不动腿
you won't be able to breathe or think or even move.

1054
00:49:47,685 --> 00:49:49,759
只想放弃
All you're gonna wanna do is give up.

1055
00:49:49,896 --> 00:49:51,353
而我有强烈的预感…
And I have a very strong feeling...

1056
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,637
你会放弃的，丹尼斯
that that's exactly what you're gonna do, Dennis.

1057
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,347
这就是区别
See, that's the difference...

1058
00:49:55,484 --> 00:49:57,808
追上丽碧这样的女孩
between getting a girl like Libby...

1059
00:49:57,945 --> 00:49:59,354
和守住丽碧这样的女孩
and keeping a girl like Libby.

1060
00:50:05,159 --> 00:50:06,272
还需要别的吗？
You good? You need anything else?

1061
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:08,448
-不，我很好 -好
- No, I'm good. - OK.

1062
00:50:15,745 --> 00:50:19,908
# Love is sweet, they say #

1063
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:26,829
# Promises of tomorrow #

1064
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:34,970
# But the tighter you grip, the faster you slip #

1065
00:50:35,139 --> 00:50:38,804
# This much I know #

1066
00:50:40,352 --> 00:50:43,352
# Lately, I want everything #

1067
00:50:43,522 --> 00:50:46,226
# Every star tied to a string #

1068
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,270
# Coffee, tea, and in between #

1069
00:50:49,445 --> 00:50:52,315
# The sweetest smile I've ever seen #

1070
00:50:52,489 --> 00:50:55,940
# A different song in every room... #

1071
00:50:56,124 --> 00:50:58,281
-该死！抱歉，抱歉 -没事
- Oh, shit! Sorry. Sorry. - That's OK.

1072
00:50:58,417 --> 00:51:00,207
-不，没事 -真是的…
- No, it's OK. It's OK. - Oh, man. It's just...

1073
00:51:00,336 --> 00:51:01,877
只是汽水
It's just soda water, honestly.

1074
00:51:02,005 --> 00:51:03,201
那我不要揉你胸部了？
Should I not rub your boob, then?

1075
00:51:04,299 --> 00:51:05,792
-是啊 -抱歉
- Yeah. - OK. Sorry.

1076
00:51:05,925 --> 00:51:06,955
我可以再揉揉这个…
I can do the other one, you know?

1077
00:51:07,092 --> 00:51:09,083
得平等对待嘛…
'Cause I'm here, I might as well just even it out.

1078
00:51:09,219 --> 00:51:10,249
不好意思
Sorry.

1079
00:51:13,098 --> 00:51:14,555
怎么样，你高兴吗？
So, you havin' a... havin' a good time?

1080
00:51:15,433 --> 00:51:17,887
是的，谢谢
Yeah. Yes, I am, thank you.

1081
00:51:21,522 --> 00:51:22,635
你瘦了
You've lost weight.

1082
00:51:22,773 --> 00:51:24,016
是啊，一点点
Yeah, just a little bit.

1083
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:25,097
是啊
Yeah.

1084
00:51:25,234 --> 00:51:26,643
锻炼嘛
You know, get on.

1085
00:51:26,777 --> 00:51:29,812
杰克在哪？我以为他也来的？
Where's Jake? I thought he was gonna be here.

1086
00:51:29,948 --> 00:51:31,191
不
Uh, no.

1087
00:51:31,324 --> 00:51:34,822
威特觉得找保姆陪他 我俩能好好过个生日
Whit thought that we'd have a better time...

1088
00:51:32,945 --> 00:51:34,771
if we got a sitter.

1089
00:51:34,952 --> 00:51:37,276
你觉得呢？
Oh. What did you think?

1090
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:43,326
我该回去了
I should get back.

1091
00:51:43,459 --> 00:51:46,292
丽碧，我一直没感谢你
Libby, um, I never actually thanked you.

1092
00:51:48,047 --> 00:51:48,994
感谢我什么？
For what?

1093
00:51:49,131 --> 00:51:52,664
让我重新回到你的生活中
Well, for just sort of lettin' me back into your life.

1094
00:51:52,801 --> 00:51:54,424
杰克的生活
Jake's life.

1095
00:51:54,554 --> 00:51:55,881
你也知道
Yeah, well, you know.

1096
00:51:57,431 --> 00:52:00,466
你再也不理我也很正常
I mean, I-I wouldn't have been surprised...

1097
00:51:58,637 --> 00:52:00,428
if you just cut me off completely, you know?

1098
00:52:00,601 --> 00:52:01,928
我怎么没想到
Ugh, now you tell me.

1099
00:52:03,395 --> 00:52:04,804
我的意思是…
Well, no, I mean...

1100
00:52:04,938 --> 00:52:06,134
不，他需要爸爸
No, he needs his dad.

1101
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:08,554
是啊
Yeah.

1102
00:52:10,568 --> 00:52:14,434
你说的对，我参加马拉松
You were right, you know, about me enterin' the marathon.

1103
00:52:14,571 --> 00:52:16,692
是为了…
It... You know, it was because I was...

1104
00:52:16,823 --> 00:52:18,695
挽回你
sort of trying to win you back kind of thing.

1105
00:52:18,825 --> 00:52:21,231
我一直希望咱们…
And I'd always kinda hoped that maybe, we'd, you know...

1106
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:22,483
可以复合
get back together and that...

1107
00:52:22,621 --> 00:52:25,289
所以但我看到你和威特…
but, you know, when I saw you with Whit...

1108
00:52:26,208 --> 00:52:27,535
-丹尼斯 -我知道，我知道
- Dennis. - I know... I know... I know...

1109
00:52:27,668 --> 00:52:30,703
我知道这样说很虚伪
I know it's the height of hypocrisy, and I know...

1110
00:52:30,837 --> 00:52:32,246
我知道说了也不会改变什么
I know doin' this isn't gonna change anything...

1111
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:34,750
或弥补什么…
or... or make anything better, but, um...

1112
00:52:37,343 --> 00:52:39,299
但我为你着想
I'd just... I'd settle for your respect.

1113
00:52:41,888 --> 00:52:43,049
希望你能微笑着
You know, I'd settle for you smiling...

1114
00:52:43,181 --> 00:52:45,587
回忆我们一起度过的日子
when you thought about the time that we had together...

1115
00:52:45,726 --> 00:52:47,800
不会觉得那段时光不值得
and not thinkin' it was a waste of time.

1116
00:52:50,105 --> 00:52:51,099
我想说的是
You know, I mean, I know...

1117
00:52:51,231 --> 00:52:54,432
我那天让你失望了，好吗？
I didn't do you any favours on that day, OK?

1118
00:52:54,568 --> 00:52:57,353
我错了，大错特错
I did a stupid, stupid thing.

1119
00:52:57,487 --> 00:53:00,439
但那是因为我觉得…
But it was only because I thought...

1120
00:53:00,573 --> 00:53:03,241
毁你一生不如毁你一天
spoiling your day was better than ruining your life.

1121
00:53:05,369 --> 00:53:07,111
你觉得有道理吗？
Does that make any sense?

1122
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,279
你真是个傻瓜
You're such an idiot.

1123
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,400
送你样东西
Hey, I got you something.

1124
00:53:19,537 --> 00:53:21,161
什么？
Oh, what is it?

1125
00:53:21,289 --> 00:53:23,364
你没有的东西
It's something I think you don't have.

1126
00:53:23,499 --> 00:53:25,158
靠得住的男朋友？
A history of reliable boyfriends?

1127
00:53:26,877 --> 00:53:29,083
不，只是…
No, it's... Well, it's only, you know...

1128
00:53:29,212 --> 00:53:30,291
-晚些打开 -好
- Open it later on. - OK.

1129
00:53:30,422 --> 00:53:31,999
生日快乐
Happy birthday.

1130
00:53:32,132 --> 00:53:33,507
-谢谢 -不会
- Thank you. - No.

1131
00:53:37,052 --> 00:53:38,047
Oh.

1132
00:53:57,279 --> 00:53:59,437
-各位，我有话要说 -上帝
- Everyone, could I have your attention? - Oh, my God.

1133
00:53:59,572 --> 00:54:03,403
各位，请听我说
Hey. Everyone, your attention, please.

1134
00:54:03,534 --> 00:54:05,656
嗨
Everyone, hi.

1135
00:54:05,786 --> 00:54:06,734
感谢你们的到来
Thank you for coming.

1136
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:08,364
-很高兴看到各位 -谢谢
- Really good to see you all. - Thank you.

1137
00:54:09,873 --> 00:54:10,868
大家都知道我们是来庆祝…
As you all know, we're here to celebrate...

1138
00:54:10,999 --> 00:54:14,699
伊丽莎白・奥利维亚・奥戴尔的生日
the birthday of one Elizabeth Olivia O'Dell.

1139
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:19,037
生日快乐
Happy birthday.

1140
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:22,671
很多人知道我最爱跑步
As many of you know, uh, my passion in life is running.

1141
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:24,998
再过几天
In fact, in a couple of days...

1142
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:27,591
我将跑完另一场马拉松，谢谢各位
I'll be completing another marathon, thank you very much.

1143
00:54:30,766 --> 00:54:36,601
跑得好和爱情成功有共同之处
Uh, now, success in running requires a lot...

1144
00:54:34,015 --> 00:54:36,552
of the same things as success in love...

1145
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:39,185
热情，决心…
passion, determination...

1146
00:54:39,315 --> 00:54:42,019
还有和丽碧相处很需要的…体力
and something I've needed a lot of with Libby, stamina.

1147
00:54:45,696 --> 00:54:47,237
真不会说话，是不？
That's just inappropriate, isn't it?

1148
00:54:47,364 --> 00:54:48,644
绕这么久，我想说的是…
The long-winded point I'm trying to make...

1149
00:54:48,782 --> 00:54:52,399
爱情和跑步都需要心
is that both love and running require heart...

1150
00:54:52,535 --> 00:54:54,610
而丽碧的心特别真
and Libby has... truly, has more heart...

1151
00:54:54,745 --> 00:54:56,618
胜过我见过所有的人
than any other person I've ever known.

1152
00:54:56,747 --> 00:54:59,368
生日快乐，宝贝
So happy birthday, sweetie.

1153
00:55:01,376 --> 00:55:02,656
谢谢！
Thank you all.

1154
00:55:07,757 --> 00:55:09,548
休闲鞋！
Oh, trainers!

1155
00:55:10,426 --> 00:55:13,094
不好意思，让我看一下好吗？
I'm sorry. Can I, uh, just see this for a second?

1156
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:15,841
各位都知道
Now, what, um... As most of you know...

1157
00:55:15,972 --> 00:55:19,055
我通常都是一个人跑…
I usually run my races alone, but I thought...

1158
00:55:20,726 --> 00:55:23,097
不知道你可否考虑…
I was wondering if you would consider...

1159
00:55:23,228 --> 00:55:24,508
陪我跑下去…
becoming my partner?

1160
00:55:30,902 --> 00:55:31,933
天呢
Oh, my.

1161
00:55:33,404 --> 00:55:36,274
丽碧，你愿意嫁给我吗？
Libby, will you marry me?

1162
00:55:49,376 --> 00:55:51,000
不，不
No, no, no, no.

1163
00:55:52,421 --> 00:55:53,665
好，我愿意
OK. Yes.

1164
00:55:53,797 --> 00:55:55,338
-真的？ -是
- Yes? - Yeah.

1165
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:11,967
真美
So beautiful.

1166
00:56:13,063 --> 00:56:14,473
真美
Just beautiful.

1167
00:56:15,315 --> 00:56:16,346
谢谢
Thank you.

1168
00:56:17,818 --> 00:56:18,932
谢谢各位
Thank you, everybody.

1169
00:56:21,613 --> 00:56:22,644
太疯狂了
Crazy.

1170
00:56:23,739 --> 00:56:24,770
我错过什么了？
What'd I miss?

1171
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,395
So...

1172
00:56:31,413 --> 00:56:33,820
你这该死的…毒药
You bloody... poison.

1173
00:56:35,375 --> 00:56:38,708
追死你追
All right. You can stick it up your ass...

1174
00:56:38,836 --> 00:56:41,504
你个美国王八蛋
you big American prick.

1175
00:56:42,578 --> 00:56:44,736
# Our love has changed #

1176
00:56:47,844 --> 00:56:50,595
他们决定了，我无所谓
- I don't mind they've decided. - # It's not the same #

1177
00:56:53,254 --> 00:56:55,958
# And the only way to say it #

1178
00:56:58,008 --> 00:56:59,751
# Is say it #

1179
00:57:01,385 --> 00:57:02,843
# It's better #

1180
00:57:06,306 --> 00:57:08,097
# I can't concede #

1181
00:57:12,311 --> 00:57:14,766
# This way I feel #

1182
00:57:17,273 --> 00:57:19,893
# For all the time we spend together #

1183
00:57:22,236 --> 00:57:26,731
# Forever just gets better #

1184
00:57:29,533 --> 00:57:32,616
# See, what I'm trying to say is #

1185
00:57:34,287 --> 00:57:38,746
# You make things better #

1186
00:57:41,376 --> 00:57:45,123
# And no matter what the day is #

1187
00:57:46,339 --> 00:57:51,000
# With you here, it's better #

1188
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:56,754
# I'll stand by you #

1189
00:58:00,809 --> 00:58:03,429
# If you stand by me #

1190
00:58:05,604 --> 00:58:09,019
# I think it's time that I reveal it #

1191
00:58:10,317 --> 00:58:12,356
# 'Cause I believe it #

1192
00:58:13,778 --> 00:58:15,900
# It's better #

1193
00:58:18,198 --> 00:58:21,530
# See, what I'm tryin' to say is #

1194
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:27,654
# You make things better #

1195
00:58:38,565 --> 00:58:39,809
丹尼斯！
Dennis!

1196
00:58:42,444 --> 00:58:44,235
怎么办，丹尼斯？
So what do you think we should do, Dennis?

1197
00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:48,690
我跟杰克解释了，但他很不高兴
Jake got really upset when I tried to explain it to him.

1198
00:58:48,824 --> 00:58:53,200
你能不能和他谈谈
So, I just wonder whether maybe you could talk to him today?

1199
00:58:58,374 --> 00:58:59,618
跟他说
You know, just... If he heard it from you...

1200
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:02,371
你永远都是他父亲之类的？
that you're always gonna be his daddy, you know?

1201
00:59:02,503 --> 00:59:04,246
看来你不节食了
I take it the diet's off.

1202
00:59:06,881 --> 00:59:08,707
丹尼斯，你有没有听我说？
Dennis, are you even listening?

1203
00:59:08,842 --> 00:59:09,837
丹尼斯！
Dennis!

1204
00:59:09,967 --> 00:59:11,508
什么？你要我告诉杰克…
What? You want... You want me to tell Jake...

1205
00:59:11,636 --> 00:59:13,842
威特人多么好
what a... what a... what a perfect guy Whit is...

1206
00:59:13,971 --> 00:59:16,888
他完美的新生活多么完美？
and it's all gonna be really perfect...

1207
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:16,828
in his new perfect life?

1208
00:59:17,015 --> 00:59:19,339
不，可以换个说法
No. Not necessarily in those words.

1209
00:59:19,476 --> 00:59:21,931
真不敢相信你要嫁给他
I cannot believe you're gonna marry this guy.

1210
00:59:22,061 --> 00:59:24,183
他把订婚戒指从鞋里拿出来
He pulled your engagement ring out of a shoe.

1211
00:59:24,313 --> 00:59:26,139
别这样，丹尼斯，只有你…
Please, Dennis, you're the only one...

1212
00:59:26,273 --> 00:59:28,348
能让杰克接受这件事
who can help Jake feel OK about this.

1213
00:59:28,484 --> 00:59:30,642
好，你想嫁给威特，没关系
Listen, if you wanna marry Whit, that's fine, OK?

1214
00:59:30,777 --> 00:59:32,733
这么大姑娘，可以犯错了
You're a big girl, and you can make your own mistakes, OK?

1215
00:59:32,862 --> 00:59:34,356
但不要到我这儿，毁了…
But don't come down here while I'm eating...

1216
00:59:34,489 --> 00:59:36,481
我的全英式加餐早茶
my full English breakfast with extra breakfast...

1217
00:59:36,616 --> 00:59:38,323
希望我为你做嫁衣，好吗？
and expect me to make things easier for you, OK?

1218
00:59:38,451 --> 00:59:40,242
能不能来点番茄酱？！
Can I please get some ketchup here?!

1219
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:43,692
我不跑了
I'm not gonna run.

1220
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:44,778
什么？！
What?!

1221
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:46,373
我说我不跑了
I said I'm not running.

1222
00:59:51,670 --> 00:59:53,080
什么叫你不跑了？
What do you mean, you're not running?

1223
00:59:53,213 --> 00:59:55,335
就是不跑了，不跑那破马拉松了
I mean, I'm not running. I'm not running a stupid marathon.

1224
00:59:56,174 --> 00:59:57,668
为什么？因为丽碧又要结婚了？
Why? Because Libby's getting married again?

1225
00:59:57,801 --> 00:59:58,749
你想怎样？
What did you think?

1226
00:59:58,885 --> 01:00:00,295
她永远找不到比你强的人？
She... She's not gonna find anybody better than you?

1227
01:00:00,428 --> 01:00:01,459
那我来教教你
Well, let me be the first to tell you.

1228
01:00:01,596 --> 01:00:03,137
你不是什么好榜样
You know, you're not a tough act to follow.

1229
01:00:03,264 --> 01:00:04,758
怎么？你以为我自己不知道？
Oh, what? You think I don't know that?

1230
01:00:04,890 --> 01:00:06,929
我无所谓了！
I don't care any more!

1231
01:00:07,684 --> 01:00:09,261
-我怎么办？ -什么你怎么办？
- What about me? - What about you?

1232
01:00:09,394 --> 01:00:11,137
我钱都在这里呢！ 很多钱！
I've got money on this! A lot of money!

1233
01:00:11,271 --> 01:00:12,848
这跟我没关系！
That is not my problem!

1234
01:00:14,107 --> 01:00:15,138
住手！
Quit it!

1235
01:00:15,274 --> 01:00:17,065
我不是轻易放弃的人
I'm not the quitter.

1236
01:00:23,198 --> 01:00:24,739
-放开我！ -我耳朵！
- Let me go! - Ow, my ear!

1237
01:00:24,866 --> 01:00:26,146
放手！
- Let go! - Ow!

1238
01:00:36,918 --> 01:00:37,949
好，好！
Oh, OK! Oh, all right!

1239
01:00:38,086 --> 01:00:41,584
好了！都冷静一下！
Oh, enough! Just... Just stop for a minute!

1240
01:00:51,699 --> 01:00:53,490
# Every day, I love you less and less #

1241
01:00:54,868 --> 01:00:57,323
# I've got to get this feeling off my chest #

1242
01:00:57,495 --> 01:00:59,783
# The doctor says all I need's pills and rest #

1243
01:01:00,331 --> 01:01:02,323
# Since every day, I love you less and less #

1244
01:01:02,499 --> 01:01:04,076
# Unless, unless #

1245
01:01:04,275 --> 01:01:05,472
跑不跑？
- # I know, I feel it # - Are you gonna run?

1246
01:01:05,610 --> 01:01:06,558
不跑！
# In my bones # - No!

1247
01:01:06,669 --> 01:01:07,831
# I'm sick, I'm tired #

1248
01:01:09,321 --> 01:01:12,570
妈呀！
# Of staying in control #

1249
01:01:09,296 --> 01:01:12,498
- # Oh, yes, I feel I race upon a wheel # - Oh, God!

1250
01:01:12,699 --> 01:01:15,272
-好，好 -你跑不跑？
- OK, OK, OK, OK. - You'll run?

1251
01:01:15,385 --> 01:01:16,878
# Oh, yes, I'm stressed #

1252
01:01:17,053 --> 01:01:18,333
# I'm sorry I digressed #

1253
01:01:18,512 --> 01:01:21,180
# lmpressed, you're dressed to SOS #

1254
01:01:21,348 --> 01:01:23,221
# Oh-oh #

1255
01:01:23,417 --> 01:01:25,990
我的蛋蛋！
- My balls! - # And my parents love me #

1256
01:01:26,102 --> 01:01:29,185
# Oh-oh #

1257
01:01:29,381 --> 01:01:32,132
对，跑吧！
- # And my girlfriend loves me # - That's it! Run away!

1258
01:01:32,258 --> 01:01:33,799
你就会这个
That's what you always do!

1259
01:01:34,844 --> 01:01:36,254
跑吧！
Run away!

1260
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:39,902
# Every day, I love you less and less #

1261
01:01:44,352 --> 01:01:45,893
嘿，这…
Hey, what the...

1262
01:01:46,771 --> 01:01:48,430
-好啊，丹尼斯 -你干什么？
- Hello, Dennis. - What are you doing?

1263
01:01:48,564 --> 01:01:49,512
戈登打电话了
Gordon called.

1264
01:01:49,648 --> 01:01:51,640
他说你不跑马拉松了
He tells me you're not running the marathon.

1265
01:01:51,775 --> 01:01:53,185
-是啊，但是… -但是什么？
- Yeah, but... - But, what?

1266
01:01:53,318 --> 01:01:54,598
你跑还是不跑？
Are you running or not?

1267
01:01:54,736 --> 01:01:55,684
-不，但是… -那就行了
- No, but... - So there you go.

1268
01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:56,982
-等等 -不好意思，丹尼斯
- Wait... - Sorry, Dennis.

1269
01:01:57,113 --> 01:01:58,690
赌有赌规，你得搬出去
A bet's a bet. You're out.

1270
01:01:59,407 --> 01:02:01,862
古施达施迪达赫先生？ 古施达施迪达赫先生！
Mr Ghoshdashtidar? Mr Ghoshdashtidar!

1271
01:02:01,992 --> 01:02:03,320
-你他娘是谁？ -嘿，你看…
- Who the hell are you? - Oh, please, look.

1272
01:02:03,452 --> 01:02:05,907
-我以为你是个好人，丹尼斯 -是…
- I thought you were a good man, Dennis. - Yeah...

1273
01:02:06,037 --> 01:02:09,286
虽然脑袋不太灵光，但没关系
A little screwed up here in the head, OK.

1274
01:02:09,415 --> 01:02:11,407
可玛雅说的对，你不好
But Maya was right about you. You are no good.

1275
01:02:11,542 --> 01:02:13,000
-听我… -总是跑…
- Look... - Always running away...

1276
01:02:13,127 --> 01:02:14,585
却从不往正道跑
never running in the right direction.

1277
01:02:14,712 --> 01:02:15,660
是，但是…
Yeah, but, oh...

1278
01:02:15,796 --> 01:02:18,369
我还给你买了新鞋，丹尼斯
I bought you new running shoes, Dennis.

1279
01:02:18,507 --> 01:02:20,997
卖货的说那是最好的鞋了
The man said they were the best you can buy.

1280
01:02:21,134 --> 01:02:22,925
-是，但是… -“但是，但是！”
- Yes, but... - "But, but, but!"

1281
01:02:23,052 --> 01:02:26,135
总是“但是！”总给自己开脱！
Always "but"! Always excuses with you!

1282
01:02:26,263 --> 01:02:29,014
总找借口，说不是你的错
Always some reason why it's not your fault!

1283
01:02:29,141 --> 01:02:32,675
告诉你，楼下的丹尼斯・道尔
I have news for you, Dennis Doyle from downstairs.

1284
01:02:33,436 --> 01:02:35,392
都是你的错！
It's all your fault!

1285
01:02:49,742 --> 01:02:50,986
-嗨 -嗨
- Hi. - Hi.

1286
01:02:52,578 --> 01:02:54,285
你要卖旧货？
You... You havin' a yard sale?

1287
01:02:55,164 --> 01:02:57,239
不，丽碧呢？
No. Where's Libby?

1288
01:02:57,374 --> 01:02:58,832
去接杰克了
Uh, she's pickin' up Jake.

1289
01:02:58,959 --> 01:03:02,493
我恐怕得先恭喜你
I suppose, uh, congratulations are in order.

1290
01:03:02,628 --> 01:03:05,379
噢，谢谢
Oh, yeah. Well, thank you.

1291
01:03:07,091 --> 01:03:08,122
勇者胜了
Best man won.

1292
01:03:09,259 --> 01:03:12,129
我倒没觉得这是竞争
Well, I wasn't really aware it was a contest.

1293
01:03:14,097 --> 01:03:16,421
丹尼斯！丹尼斯！ 杰克在你这儿？
Dennis! Dennis! Is Jake with you?

1294
01:03:16,557 --> 01:03:17,505
没有，怎么？
No, why? I...

1295
01:03:17,641 --> 01:03:18,885
他在家吗？威特
Well, is he here, Whit?

1296
01:03:19,018 --> 01:03:20,180
-你不是去接他吗？ -杰克！
- I thought you were picking him up. - Jake!

1297
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:21,258
-丽碧？ -杰克！
- Libby? - Jake!

1298
01:03:21,395 --> 01:03:22,474
丽碧，怎么…
Libby, what is...

1299
01:03:22,604 --> 01:03:23,979
-你跟他说什么了？ -什么？
- What did you say to him?! - I... What are you...

1300
01:03:24,105 --> 01:03:25,267
我什么都没说，怎么了？
I didn't say anything. What do you mean?

1301
01:03:25,398 --> 01:03:26,560
他去艾米丽家，然后不知怎么
Well, he was at Emily's and something happened.

1302
01:03:26,691 --> 01:03:27,722
就跑出去了
He just ran out.

1303
01:03:27,859 --> 01:03:30,065
-什么？ -他跑了，明白吗？
- What? - He has run away, OK?

1304
01:03:30,194 --> 01:03:31,569
杰克跑了！
Jake ran away!

1305
01:03:36,366 --> 01:03:37,397
杰克！
Jake!

1306
01:03:38,993 --> 01:03:40,024
杰克！
Jake!

1307
01:03:42,538 --> 01:03:43,569
戈登！
Gordon!

1308
01:03:44,248 --> 01:03:45,279
戈登！
Gordon!

1309
01:03:46,667 --> 01:03:48,244
-怎么？ -杰克跑了
- Yes? - Jake's run away.

1310
01:03:48,377 --> 01:03:50,250
-什么？ -他跑了！
- What? - He's run away!

1311
01:03:50,378 --> 01:03:51,326
我马上下来
All right. Well, wait a minute.

1312
01:03:51,463 --> 01:03:53,254
先冷静，想一想…
Just calm down. Think for a second.

1313
01:03:53,381 --> 01:03:54,543
他可能去哪儿？
Where would he go?

1314
01:04:36,627 --> 01:04:38,168
嘿，小鼻涕孩
Hiya, snot-face.

1315
01:04:57,854 --> 01:04:59,051
他没事
Yeah, he's fine.

1316
01:05:00,147 --> 01:05:02,388
我们过一个半小时就回去了
We'll be back in about a half an hour, I guess.

1317
01:05:02,524 --> 01:05:03,721
好
OK.

1318
01:05:06,194 --> 01:05:07,438
妈妈生气了？
Is she mad at me?

1319
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,313
不，你没事她就放心了
No, no. She's just glad you're OK.

1320
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:14,903
发生什么事了？
Do you wanna tell me what happened?

1321
01:05:15,035 --> 01:05:17,905
艾米丽不想做我的女朋友了
Emily doesn't wanna be my girlfriend any more.

1322
01:05:18,038 --> 01:05:19,152
为什么？
Why not?

1323
01:05:19,289 --> 01:05:21,495
有另一个男孩，罗伯特…
'Cause there's this other boy, Robert...

1324
01:05:21,624 --> 01:05:23,201
他有条马尾辫…
and he's got a ponytail...

1325
01:05:23,334 --> 01:05:25,373
她现在喜欢他了
and she likes him now.

1326
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:27,376
她喜欢他就因为他有马尾辫？
What, she likes him because he's got a ponytail?

1327
01:05:27,505 --> 01:05:29,082
嗯
Uh-huh.

1328
01:05:31,258 --> 01:05:32,538
杰克恩贝
Jake 'n Bake...

1329
01:05:32,676 --> 01:05:33,920
等你大了就知道了…
as you get older, you're gonna realize...

1330
01:05:34,052 --> 01:05:36,293
有很多事非我们所愿
there are a lot of things that you don't like, OK?

1331
01:05:36,429 --> 01:05:38,717
比这更糟
Things much worse than this.

1332
01:05:38,848 --> 01:05:41,089
而那时我们不能逃跑
And when those things happen, you can't just run away.

1333
01:05:41,225 --> 01:05:43,098
为什么？
Why not?

1334
01:05:43,227 --> 01:05:45,515
因为那解决不了问题
Because it doesn't solve the problem.

1335
01:05:45,645 --> 01:05:46,640
虽然你跑开了
You know, when you start running...

1336
01:05:46,771 --> 01:05:47,719
问题依然在那儿
the problem's still there.

1337
01:05:47,856 --> 01:05:50,429
你要直面它，想出办法
You've got to stick at it, and then figure out a way...

1338
01:05:50,566 --> 01:05:53,566
解决它，即便这很难
to solve the problem, even if it's really, really hard.

1339
01:05:53,694 --> 01:05:55,602
你就是这么做的吗？爸
Is that what you do, Dad?

1340
01:05:59,407 --> 01:06:00,604
爸？
Dad?

1341
01:06:03,369 --> 01:06:04,400
丹尼斯！
Dennis!

1342
01:06:05,579 --> 01:06:06,776
丹尼斯！
Dennis!

1343
01:06:06,914 --> 01:06:07,945
戈登！
Gordon!

1344
01:06:10,834 --> 01:06:11,865
戈登！
Gordon!

1345
01:06:14,087 --> 01:06:15,711
-找到他了？ -是的
- Found him? - Yes.

1346
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:17,629
好，你不能住这儿
Good. You can't stay here.

1347
01:06:18,466 --> 01:06:19,414
戈登！
Gordon!

1348
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:20,498
怎么？！
What?!

1349
01:06:20,634 --> 01:06:22,425
我跑
I'm running.

1350
01:06:23,970 --> 01:06:25,298
那么上来吧
Well, come on up then.

1351
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:29,674
真舒服，哪儿弄来的？
Wow, these are great. Where'd you get 'em?

1352
01:06:29,809 --> 01:06:31,219
-威特那儿 -谢谢
- Whit's place. - Thanks.

1353
01:06:31,352 --> 01:06:32,431
秘诀就是…
See, the trick is...

1354
01:06:32,561 --> 01:06:34,885
在赛前装一肚子碳水化合物
you got to load up on carbs the night before the race.

1355
01:06:35,022 --> 01:06:35,970
这是我在《时尚・Cosmo》上看的
I read it in Cosmo.

1356
01:06:36,106 --> 01:06:37,101
腿怎么样？紧不？
How are the legs? Not too tight?

1357
01:06:37,232 --> 01:06:38,690
不，挺好的
No. No, they're fine.

1358
01:06:38,817 --> 01:06:39,931
所有的都准备好了吗？
Have you got everything you need?

1359
01:06:40,068 --> 01:06:42,439
鞋，短裤，鸡鸡衫儿
You know, your shoes, your shorts, penis t-shirt?

1360
01:06:42,570 --> 01:06:44,361
是的
- Yes. - Oh.

1361
01:06:52,328 --> 01:06:53,738
现在没兴趣
I'm not really in the mood.

1362
01:06:53,871 --> 01:06:55,365
-这是抹乳头上的 -什么？
- It's for your nipples. - What?

1363
01:06:55,498 --> 01:06:59,411
二十六里跑下来 你的乳头将和衬衫产生无数次摩擦
You run a 26-mile race, a lot of friction...

1364
01:06:58,040 --> 01:06:59,320
is generated from your shirt to your nipples.

1365
01:06:59,543 --> 01:07:01,867
而马拉松之大患，即乳头发炎
And the last thing you want during a marathon...

1366
01:07:02,003 --> 01:07:03,200
-《时尚・Cosmo》？ -是的
is nipple chafing.

1367
01:07:03,338 --> 01:07:04,535
我可不往乳头上抹那玩意
- Cosmo? - Yeah.

1368
01:07:04,672 --> 01:07:06,580
这个也不吃了，我睡觉就好了
I'm not puttin' that on my nipples, OK?

1369
01:07:04,628 --> 01:07:06,501
And I'm not gonna eat this. Let's just go to sleep.

1370
01:07:06,716 --> 01:07:08,293
那么我来帮你铺床
Well, at least, let me make your bed for you.

1371
01:07:11,679 --> 01:07:12,627
还需要别的吗？
Anything else?

1372
01:07:12,763 --> 01:07:13,842
有枕头吗？
Have you got a pillow?

1373
01:07:13,972 --> 01:07:16,178
-没有 -那没了
- No. - Well, then I guess I'm fine.

1374
01:07:20,895 --> 01:07:22,851
明天要几点起床？
Hey, what time do you have to be up tomorrow?

1375
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:26,015
闹钟定到七点吧
Well, we should set the alarm for about seven o'clock.

1376
01:07:26,149 --> 01:07:27,773
-我没闹钟 -为什么？
- I don't have an alarm clock. - Why not?

1377
01:07:27,901 --> 01:07:29,774
我哪儿也不用去
I never need to be anywhere.

1378
01:07:34,365 --> 01:07:35,693
比赛九点开始
The race starts at 9.00, OK?

1379
01:07:35,825 --> 01:07:38,860
我们至少八点前出发，好吗？
So we should leave here no later than 8.00, OK?

1380
01:07:38,994 --> 01:07:40,191
好
OK.

1381
01:07:42,455 --> 01:07:43,569
晚安
Night.

1382
01:07:43,706 --> 01:07:44,286
爱你呦
Love you.

1383
01:07:51,713 --> 01:07:52,661
在清晨向您问好
A very good morning to you.

1384
01:07:52,798 --> 01:07:56,711
伦敦美好的天气迎来了 首届年度耐克环河赛
It's a beautiful day here in London...

1385
01:07:54,711 --> 01:07:56,619
for the first annual Nike River Run.

1386
01:07:56,843 --> 01:07:59,084
现场的观众非常热情
We've had a very warm welcome from the crowd...

1387
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:00,879
今天的天气也极适宜于本次比赛 丹妮斯
and we've got perfect conditions for this race, Denise.

1388
01:08:01,013 --> 01:08:02,423
是啊
We certainly have.

1389
01:08:02,556 --> 01:08:04,762
环绕着泰晤士河的这廿六点二英里
26.2 miles along the River Thames...

1390
01:08:04,892 --> 01:08:06,967
吸引了世界各地的一万名长跑爱好者
10,000 runners from all over the globe...

1391
01:08:07,102 --> 01:08:11,679
并使很多人有机会 为慈善事业筹集资金
and an amazing way for many of these folks...

1392
01:08:09,056 --> 01:08:11,593
to raise money for so many worthwhile charities.

1393
01:08:11,814 --> 01:08:13,058
可以看到，赛会人员…
And as we can see, race officials...

1394
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:17,767
已经在起点忙碌起来 迎接将在一小时内开始的比赛
are already busy at the starting line...

1395
01:08:15,186 --> 01:08:17,676
with the start less than an hour away.

1396
01:08:24,075 --> 01:08:25,866
出租车！
- Taxi! - # Keep on runnin' #

1397
01:08:25,993 --> 01:08:27,321
出租车！

1398
01:08:27,453 --> 01:08:30,287

等等！
- Wait! - # One fine day #

1401
01:08:32,533 --> 01:08:33,695
# I'm gonna be the one #

1402
01:08:33,868 --> 01:08:35,527
# To make you understand #

1403

比赛线路极佳
- It's a wonderful course. - # Oh, yeah #

1404
01:08:37,128 --> 01:08:39,452
他们将环绕泰晤士河…
- They'll wind around the Thames... - # I'm gonna be your man #

1405
01:08:40,297 --> 01:08:43,083

They'll cross over five bridges, including Osney Bridge...

1406
01:08:43,217 --> 01:08:44,627
艾尔伯特桥，千禧桥
Albert Bridge, and the Millennium Bridge.

1407
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:46,586
按自己的节奏跑，好吗？
OK, OK. So go at your own pace today, all right?

1408
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:48,628
-稳扎稳打 -好，稳扎稳打
- Slow and steady. - OK. Slow and steady.

1409
01:08:50,306 --> 01:08:52,013
此外冠军的有力争夺者还包括…
Yeah, they're challenging the leaders we have here.

1410
01:08:52,141 --> 01:08:54,678
来自日本的日吉清水

当然，还有住荣山手
and, of course, up there also, is Sumi Yamata.

1412
01:08:58,855 --> 01:08:59,886
小心！
Watch it!

1413
01:09:00,774 --> 01:09:02,481
白痴！
- Idiot! - # Keep on runnin' #

1414

倒回去！

1415
01:09:05,444 --> 01:09:06,902
不回去！
- # My heart # - No, we're not goin' back!

1416
01:09:07,029 --> 01:09:10,029
另外还应关注肯尼亚的选手们
Amongst the names we should keep an eye on...

Always so strong, Wilson Deetay and Collington Degwa...

1419
01:09:13,743 --> 01:09:16,577
是第一集团的常客
they always can be found at front of the pack.

1420
01:09:20,666 --> 01:09:21,614
只能载到这儿了，伙计
This is as far as I can get, mate.

1421
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:23,125
你得载我到起点
But I need to get to the start of the race.

1422
01:09:23,251 --> 01:09:25,741
过了桥就是 请付十五磅，伙计
Well, it's just over the bridge. That's fifteen quid, mate.

1423
01:09:25,879 --> 01:09:26,958
你有钱吗？
Have you got any money?

1424
01:09:27,088 --> 01:09:28,831
师傅，钱有点小问题
Sir, we have a slight liquidity problem.

1425
01:09:28,965 --> 01:09:30,838
可惜了
That is a shame.

1426
01:09:33,218 --> 01:09:34,166
不，等等
Uh, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1427
01:09:34,303 --> 01:09:36,259
看这是19…
Look, look. This is a 19...

1428
01:09:36,388 --> 01:09:39,803
40年的劳力士520蚝式恒动泡泡背表
...40 Rolex 520 Perpetual Oyster with a bubble back.

1429
01:09:39,933 --> 01:09:40,881
这可真不赖
That's not too shabby.

1430
01:09:41,017 --> 01:09:41,965
戈登，你不能给他…
Gordon, you can't possibly give him...

1431
01:09:42,101 --> 01:09:43,215
算是投资了
Hey, it's an investment.

1432
01:09:44,562 --> 01:09:45,842
戈登，谢谢
Gordon, thank you.

1433
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:47,094
那一会儿见了
I'll see you later then.

1434
01:09:49,471 --> 01:09:50,799
# Keep on runnin' #

1435
01:09:51,026 --> 01:09:52,270
祝你好运！
Hey, good luck!

1436
01:09:52,402 --> 01:09:56,446
对于运动员们来说 今天的比赛从凌晨就已开始
Now, typically, the day would have started...

1437
01:09:54,267 --> 01:09:56,342
at the crack of dawn for most of these runners.

1438
01:09:56,572 --> 01:09:57,852
吃过了精心配制的早餐
They had a balanced breakfast...

1439
01:09:57,990 --> 01:10:01,323
做好了身体和精神上的充分准备
precise physical and mental preparation.

1440
01:10:01,451 --> 01:10:04,617
在这样的比赛中 把希望完全寄托于偶然的人
On a day like today, to leave anything to chance...

1441
01:10:04,746 --> 01:10:06,702
不是极其幼稚
you'd either have to be extremely naive...

1442
01:10:06,831 --> 01:10:08,159
就是纯粹的傻瓜
or a complete idiot.

1443
01:10:08,237 --> 01:10:10,561
# Everyone is talkin' about me #

1444
01:10:16,256 --> 01:10:17,714
这儿，往我这儿
Over here. To me, to me.

1445
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:20,295
对，小心
That's it. Be careful.

1446
01:10:20,426 --> 01:10:21,505
那是古董
That's an antique.

1447
01:10:22,345 --> 01:10:24,384
-开始了吗 -还没有
- Did it start? Did it start? - Not yet.

1448
01:10:24,513 --> 01:10:25,675
-打开 -好啦
- Turn it on. - Here we go.

1449
01:10:25,806 --> 01:10:29,423
这些天来我们很高兴地看到 选手的背景混杂
What do we love about these days...

1450
01:10:27,169 --> 01:10:29,327
is the sheer mix of competitors.

1451
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:31,183
模样身材个个不同
They come in all shapes and sizes...

1452
01:10:31,311 --> 01:10:35,604
从那边精英到…怎么说呢
from the elite over there to the... how should we put it...

1453
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:37,225
不很精英的
not so elite.

1454
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,680
是丹尼斯！
That's Dennis!

1455
01:10:41,945 --> 01:10:43,569
看这伸展运动
Look at that stretch. Look at that.

1456
01:10:45,198 --> 01:10:46,360
全注加倍？
Double or nothing?

1457
01:10:46,491 --> 01:10:47,439
好
Yeah, right.

1458
01:10:47,575 --> 01:10:54,656
比赛即将开始，作为赛前惯例 选手们应该热身了
Just a few minutes to go now. The warm-ups should be complete.

1459
01:10:51,272 --> 01:10:54,556
It's time, if you have one, for that pre-race ritual.

1460
01:10:56,624 --> 01:10:58,865
你真来了
Well, well, well. You made it, huh?

1461
01:10:59,001 --> 01:10:59,949
是啊
Yeah.

1462
01:11:00,086 --> 01:11:01,627
我来祝你好运
Just wanna wish you luck out there.

1463
01:11:01,754 --> 01:11:04,375
你也是，你乳头如何？
You, too. How are your nipples?

1464
01:11:05,924 --> 01:11:06,955
很好
Great.

1465
01:11:17,309 --> 01:11:19,597
-土司来了 -比赛即将开始，赛会人员…
- More toast. - Only a few moments...

1466
01:11:19,728 --> 01:11:21,720
你希望谁赢？爸爸还是威特？
to go now, and the officials are...

1467
01:11:19,670 --> 01:11:21,626
Who do you want to win, Daddy or Whit?

1468
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:24,772
-你希望谁赢？ -当然是爸爸
- Who do you wanna win? - Daddy, of course.

1469
01:11:24,899 --> 01:11:26,523
-如果是业余的选手 -你呢？
- If you're one of the fun runners... - What about you?

1470
01:11:26,651 --> 01:11:28,939
-跑完全程就是胜利 -吃土司
- It's just about completing the course. - Eat your toast.

1471
01:11:29,069 --> 01:11:31,144
参赛选手的队伍蔚为壮观
And what a great turnout we've got here today.

1472
01:11:43,874 --> 01:11:45,071
为什么总是我扮乌龟？
Why am I always the tortoise?

1473
01:11:45,208 --> 01:11:46,156
愿赌服输
A bet's a bet.

1474
01:11:46,293 --> 01:11:47,241
借过…
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

1475
01:11:47,377 --> 01:11:48,752
抱歉
- Pardon me. - All right.

1476
01:11:50,797 --> 01:11:52,255
丹尼斯，真得承认…
Well, Dennis, I gotta admit...

1477
01:11:52,381 --> 01:11:53,756
我没想到你能走这么远
I didn't think you'd make it this far.

1478
01:11:54,508 --> 01:11:55,705
我是说…
I mean, uh...

1479
01:11:55,843 --> 01:11:59,176
你的过往战绩实在不敢恭维…
you don't exactly have the best, uh, track record...

1480
01:11:59,304 --> 01:12:01,212
那是过去，现在这是开始
now, do you?

1481
01:11:59,244 --> 01:12:01,117
Yeah, well that was then, and this is now.

1482
01:12:01,347 --> 01:12:02,378
不，丹尼斯
No, Dennis.

1483
01:12:04,725 --> 01:12:05,756
这是开始
This is now.

1484
01:12:11,982 --> 01:12:13,096
好
All right.

1485
01:12:17,528 --> 01:12:19,022
不用感觉你非得跟上我
Don't feel you have to keep up with me.

1486
01:12:19,155 --> 01:12:20,696
不用感觉你非得跟上我
Well, don't feel you have to keep up with me.

1487
01:12:20,823 --> 01:12:22,649
好啊，要的就是这个劲儿
Oh, yeah, that's the spirit.

1488
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:24,158
他们出发了，克里斯
And they're off, Chris.

1489
01:12:24,284 --> 01:12:25,908
又一次盛大的马拉松…
Yet another great marathon...

1490
01:12:26,036 --> 01:12:27,779
在伦敦开跑
getting under way here in London.

1491
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:34,784
运动员在拥挤的伦敦街道上 跑上廿六点二里…
And having these great runners go 26.2 miles...

1492
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,685
of crowded London streets...

1493
01:12:34,918 --> 01:12:36,625
你昨天对杰克说的很好
That was great, what you did with Jake yesterday, by the way.

1494
01:12:36,753 --> 01:12:37,701
谢谢
Thanks.

1495
01:12:37,838 --> 01:12:39,415
丽碧也很感激你
I know Libby really appreciated it, too.

1496
01:12:39,547 --> 01:12:40,495
那我很高兴
Oh, I'm glad.

1497
01:12:40,632 --> 01:12:41,663
她太感激了
In fact, she was so appreciative...

1498
01:12:41,758 --> 01:12:43,465
所以我们在床上小跳了一下
we had a nice little jump on the bed.

1499
01:12:43,593 --> 01:12:45,051
-什么？ -回见了
- What? - Have a good race.

1500
01:12:56,979 --> 01:12:58,093
这还不够吗？
Isn't it enough?

1501
01:12:58,230 --> 01:12:59,178
什么？
What?

1502
01:12:59,315 --> 01:13:01,770
你得到她了？还不够吗？
You got the girl, all right? Isn't it enough?

1503
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:03,180
我只是觉得你应该明白…
I just think it's high time you realize...

1504
01:13:03,318 --> 01:13:04,859
你们已经结束了
that it's over, sir.

1505
01:13:04,986 --> 01:13:07,820
否则等我们搬去芝加哥 你会很难过
Otherwise, it's gonna be very tough for you...

1506
01:13:06,466 --> 01:13:08,671
- when we move to Chicago. - What?

1507
01:13:07,989 --> 01:13:08,653
什么？
You better slow down there, chief.

1508
01:13:08,906 --> 01:13:10,364
最好悠着点，哥们

1509
01:13:10,491 --> 01:13:11,735
你还差得远呢
You got a long way to go.

1510
01:13:11,867 --> 01:13:13,740
你也是
- Yeah, well, so have you. - Oh, yeah!

1511
01:13:13,952 --> 01:13:15,327
好啊
Yes, I like it.

1512
01:13:15,454 --> 01:13:16,568
我喜欢你这劲头
Run, fat boy, run!

1513
01:13:16,705 --> 01:13:18,578
跑吧，胖墩，快跑！

1514
01:13:23,127 --> 01:13:24,668
我能减肥
I can lose weight...

1515
01:13:24,795 --> 01:13:26,668
但你永远是个混蛋
but you'll always be an asshole.

1516
01:13:27,589 --> 01:13:30,044
-肯尼亚选手依然优势明显，丹妮斯 -看啊
Now, once again, it's still being dominated...

1517
01:13:30,175 --> 01:13:32,630
选手们正跑过河岸
- by the Kenyans, Denise. - Look at that.

1518
01:13:30,110 --> 01:13:32,517
The runners are making their way along the embankment.

1519
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:34,004
多么美丽的…
What a beautiful view of the...

1520
01:13:40,851 --> 01:13:42,510
领先集团的选手们
So, here we are among the leaders of the moment.

1521
01:13:42,644 --> 01:13:45,312
在开局阶段步履轻松
The pace is relatively relaxed for the opening miles.

1522
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:48,519
似乎有些太轻松了，克里斯
Maybe a little too relaxed, Chris.

1523
01:13:48,649 --> 01:13:51,435
有几位业余选手赶了上来
It looks like we've got a couple of amateurs...

1524
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:51,330
coming up from the back.

1525
01:13:55,780 --> 01:13:56,728
妈！
Mom!

1526
01:13:56,865 --> 01:14:00,447
这两位男士怎么开心怎么跑
It looks like these two boys...

1527
01:13:58,508 --> 01:14:00,334
are running a race of their own here today.

1528
01:14:00,576 --> 01:14:02,947
在职业选手中掀起了一阵波澜
In fact, they're causing quite a stir...

1529
01:14:03,078 --> 01:14:06,161
这种场面出现在开局阶段 实在出乎意料
among the serious runners.

1530
01:14:03,012 --> 01:14:04,589
Not something you'd really expect...

1531
01:14:04,763 --> 01:14:06,043
at this stage in the race.

1532
01:14:06,290 --> 01:14:07,452
抱歉
Oh. Sorry, sir.

1533
01:14:08,208 --> 01:14:09,239
有人倒下了
There's a man down.

1534
01:14:11,169 --> 01:14:12,200
抱歉
Sorry.

1535
01:14:13,462 --> 01:14:16,083
注意力集中在这两位运动员身上
All eyes right now are on these two runners.

1536
01:14:16,215 --> 01:14:18,006
不，不，你在干什么？
No, no, no, no, no. What are you doing?

1537
01:14:18,133 --> 01:14:20,457
-我们将尽快带来相关报道 -慢点
- We hope to bring you that information quickly. - Slow down.

1538
01:14:21,094 --> 01:14:22,042
不过挺上镜的
But he looks good, doesn't he?

1539
01:14:22,178 --> 01:14:23,340
-是啊 -是啊
- Oh, yeah. - Oh, yeah.

1540
01:14:23,471 --> 01:14:25,629
…创造新的世界纪录
...setting a new world record.

1541
01:14:30,727 --> 01:14:31,675
你想证明什么？
What are you trying to prove?

1542
01:14:31,812 --> 01:14:33,353
她不爱你了
She doesn't love you any more, man.

1543
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:34,642
我不是为丽碧而跑
I'm not doing this for Libby.

1544
01:14:34,773 --> 01:14:35,768
算了吧
Yeah, right.

1545
01:14:35,899 --> 01:14:36,894
你真可笑
You're ridiculous, dude.

1546
01:14:37,025 --> 01:14:39,396
怎么，威特，跟不上了？
What's the matter, Whit, can't keep up?

1547
01:14:48,674 --> 01:14:49,669
Oh!

1548
01:14:55,749 --> 01:14:56,863
爸爸！
Daddy!

1549
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,826
丹尼斯！不，威特！
Dennis! I mean, Whit!

1550
01:15:04,715 --> 01:15:05,912
看起来很严重
It does look very serious.

1551
01:15:06,050 --> 01:15:07,081
我们将带来详细消息
We're getting some more information...

1552
01:15:24,816 --> 01:15:26,855
别起来！别起来！
Stay down! Stay down!

1553
01:15:41,956 --> 01:15:43,284
你干什么去？
Where do you think you're going?

1554
01:15:43,416 --> 01:15:46,084
-我得去帮助丹尼斯 -为什么？
- I have to go help Dennis. - Why?

1555
01:15:46,210 --> 01:15:48,249
因为我是助理教练
Because I am the assistant coach.

1556
01:15:50,005 --> 01:15:51,036
好耶！
Yes!

1557
01:15:51,173 --> 01:15:53,497
他在十里标记处一马当先
He now leads at the ten-mile mark.

1558
01:15:56,886 --> 01:15:57,834
看起来伤得很重
And that looks really painful.

1559
01:15:57,970 --> 01:16:01,385
恐怕他比赛将在利兹医院结束了
Looks like this runner's race day...

1560
01:15:59,357 --> 01:16:01,265
will be ending at a Leeds hospital.

1561
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:02,795
真是可惜…
Yeah, absolutely tragic...

1562
01:16:02,933 --> 01:16:04,427
妈，想想办法！
Mom, do something!

1563
01:16:04,559 --> 01:16:06,017
-没错，让我们关注… -走
- We certainly do. Let's get back... - Come on.

1564
01:16:06,144 --> 01:16:07,472
女子组的领先选手
To the leaders in the female race.

1565
01:16:16,903 --> 01:16:17,934
妈的
Shit.

1566
01:16:44,686 --> 01:16:46,393
Huh?

1567
01:16:48,264 --> 01:16:50,885
戈登，我替大家说…
Gordon, I think I speak for everyone here...

1568
01:16:51,016 --> 01:16:53,423
还钱
when I say, "Give me my money."

1569
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:55,303
五千块
Five grand, please.

1570
01:16:57,939 --> 01:16:59,812
钱的事是这样的
OK, here's the thing about the money...

1571
01:16:59,941 --> 01:17:00,972
说起来好笑
and, actually, it's kind of funny.

1572
01:17:02,276 --> 01:17:04,067
…我没有
Uh... I don't have it.

1573
01:17:06,571 --> 01:17:07,815
容我们出去谈下
Would you excuse us a moment?

1574
01:17:12,994 --> 01:17:15,152
我找一位病人，丹尼斯・道尔
Hi. I'm looking for a patient, Dennis Doyle.

1575
01:17:15,287 --> 01:17:16,615
你是家人嘛？
Are you family?

1576
01:17:16,747 --> 01:17:18,288
-是 -道尔？
- Yeah. - Doyle?

1577
01:17:18,415 --> 01:17:19,873
是的，丹尼斯・道尔
Yes, Dennis Doyle.

1578
01:17:21,543 --> 01:17:24,377
抱歉，没有这个人
Oh, I'm sorry, we don't seem to have anyone...

1579
01:17:22,758 --> 01:17:24,251
registered by that name.

1580
01:17:24,504 --> 01:17:27,125
你确定？他参加了马拉松
Are you sure? He's a runner in the marathon.

1581
01:17:27,256 --> 01:17:28,584
哦，那位运动员，有
Oh, the runner. Oh, yeah.

1582
01:17:28,716 --> 01:17:30,624
他刚到
Well, he's just arrived.

1583
01:17:30,759 --> 01:17:32,336
-丽碧？ -威特？
- Libby? - Whit?

1584
01:17:32,469 --> 01:17:33,666
你怎么知道我在这儿？
How'd you know I was here?

1585
01:17:33,804 --> 01:17:35,132
你怎么在这儿？
What are you doing here?

1586
01:17:35,263 --> 01:17:37,385
宝贝，那个疯子绊我
Honey, that psychopath tripped me.

1587
01:17:37,515 --> 01:17:40,005
把我绊倒，我的韧带可能伤了
He tripped me. I think I have ligament damage.

1588
01:17:40,142 --> 01:17:41,683
几位，我们能不能…
Guys, can we... Can we just...

1589
01:17:41,810 --> 01:17:44,098
伙计…我是病人啊
Fellas, can we... Look, I'm a patient, please.

1590
01:17:44,229 --> 01:17:45,770
再…来找我！
Just one... Find me!

1591
01:17:45,897 --> 01:17:47,391
慢点！
Easy, easy! Ow!

1592
01:17:47,524 --> 01:17:49,432
文森特，我刚才说没钱
Vince, look, when I said I didn't have the money...

1593
01:17:49,567 --> 01:17:50,515
是指没带在身上
I meant I didn't have the money here.

1594
01:17:50,652 --> 01:17:52,691
-我能还 -你一定会还
- I can pay. - Oh, you're gonna pay.

1595
01:17:53,988 --> 01:17:56,988
不，等等…文森特
No, wait. Look... Vincent.

1596
01:17:57,115 --> 01:17:58,656
干嘛？
Wait... Wait... What?

1597
01:17:58,784 --> 01:17:59,981
等下！
Wait. Wait a tick.

1598
01:18:05,331 --> 01:18:07,619
没这么快结束，伙计
Not so bloody fast, mate.

1599
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:08,994
你他娘是谁？
Who the hell are you?

1600
01:18:09,126 --> 01:18:10,703
多亏你了，古先生！
Thanks a lot, Mr G!

1601
01:18:10,836 --> 01:18:12,543
你那朋友很够意思
Your friend is a man of honour.

1602
01:18:12,671 --> 01:18:13,619
什么，文森特吗
What, Vincent?

1603
01:18:13,755 --> 01:18:17,538
对，他说等回来再收拾你
Yes, he said he's going to kick shit out of you later instead.

1604
01:18:17,675 --> 01:18:18,623
真奇怪
I don't understand.

1605
01:18:18,759 --> 01:18:21,629
电视上说他送到这儿了
On the TV, they said he was being brought here.

1606
01:18:21,762 --> 01:18:23,137
稍等
One second.

1607
01:18:23,263 --> 01:18:24,638
我可以告他
I could sue him. You know that, right?

1608
01:18:24,765 --> 01:18:25,962
我可以告他…
I could sue him for everything he has...

1609
01:18:26,099 --> 01:18:28,055
但我真拿…
but, you know, seriously, what am I gonna do...

1610
01:18:28,184 --> 01:18:31,350
这个穷得只剩披萨盒 反基督的家伙没办法
with some pizza boxes and a Judas Priest t-shirt?

1611
01:18:31,479 --> 01:18:33,103
宝贝，那肯定是意外
Honey, I'm sure it was an accident.

1612
01:18:33,230 --> 01:18:34,807
你没在现场
Well, you weren't there, OK?

1613
01:18:34,940 --> 01:18:36,932
你没看到，他好像疯了
You didn't see it. He was wild-eyed, all right?

1614
01:18:37,067 --> 01:18:39,273
嘴角冒出白沫
He was frothing at the mouth at one point.

1615
01:18:39,402 --> 01:18:42,236
我就像跟疯狗跑马拉松一样
It was like running a marathon with Cujo, OK?

1616
01:18:42,363 --> 01:18:45,565
杰克，伙计，我来控制床好吗？
Jake, buddy, can I control the bed, please?

1617
01:18:45,699 --> 01:18:47,572
不行，但你可以看我控制
No, but you can watch me control it.

1618
01:18:50,203 --> 01:18:51,661
丽碧？你在哪儿？
Libby? Where are you?

1619
01:18:51,788 --> 01:18:53,032
-医院 -你和他在一起？
- The hospital. - Are you with him?

1620
01:18:53,164 --> 01:18:54,112
不，他没在这儿
No, he's not here.

1621
01:18:54,249 --> 01:18:55,244
什么叫没在这哪儿？
Well, what do you mean he's not there?

1622
01:18:55,375 --> 01:18:56,750
就是没在这儿
I mean, he's not here.

1623
01:18:57,460 --> 01:18:58,918
那他到底在哪儿？
Well, where the hell is he then?

1624
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:31,900
知道了，还没结束呢
All right. It's still... It's on.

1625
01:19:32,031 --> 01:19:33,145
比赛还没结束
The race is still on.

1626
01:19:34,075 --> 01:19:36,696
你居然放戈登走，文森特
I can't believe you let Gordon go, Vincent.

1627
01:19:36,827 --> 01:19:37,941
-但他说他会付的… -回到报道当中
- Yeah, but he said he was gonna pay us... - Back to the story.

1628
01:19:38,078 --> 01:19:39,951
-对吗，文森特？ -第一段画面…
- Right, Vincent? - The first images are coming in...

1629
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:41,871
-似乎拍自手机 -文森特？
- from what looks like a camera phone... - Vincent?

1630
01:19:41,998 --> 01:19:44,453
-文森特？ -画面上是一位孤独，神秘的运动员
- Vincent? - Showing a lone, mysterious runner.

1631
01:19:44,584 --> 01:19:47,917
他好像伤得很严重
Uh, he's looking very badly injured, I must say...

1632
01:19:48,045 --> 01:19:50,001
他使干道的交通…
and he's also causing some major traffic...

1633
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,084
-出租 -是啊，是劳力士
- Cab. - Yeah, it's a Rolex.

1634
01:19:53,217 --> 01:19:55,292
我不会卖的，这就是传家宝了
I'm not gonna sell it. It's a family heirloom now.

1635
01:19:56,386 --> 01:19:57,417
干什么！
What!

1636
01:19:58,930 --> 01:20:00,803
等等！你们干什么？！
Wait! What are you doing?!

1637
01:20:00,932 --> 01:20:03,505
-上车！ -怎么能随便抢出租呢！
- Step on it! - You can't just take a man's cab!

1638
01:20:05,477 --> 01:20:06,425
知道啦！
All right!

1639
01:20:06,562 --> 01:20:07,676
好啊…
Hello, there...

1640
01:20:07,813 --> 01:20:09,639
楼下的丹尼斯・道尔！
Dennis Doyle from downstairs!

1641
01:20:09,773 --> 01:20:11,017
你他娘是谁？
Who the hell are you?

1642
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:13,858
美人儿，加油！
You beauty, come on!

1643
01:20:15,236 --> 01:20:16,943
伦敦市落入余辉之中
And as the sun sets over London...

1644
01:20:17,071 --> 01:20:18,648
而我们依然在调查…
we're still looking into the identity...

1645
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:21,531
这位神秘运动员的身份
of that mysterious runner.

1646
01:20:21,658 --> 01:20:24,113
加油，丹尼斯，你可以的！加油！
Come on, Dennis, you can do it! Come on!

1647
01:20:24,244 --> 01:20:25,987
目前唯一能确认的…
The only concrete thing we do know...

1648
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:29,654
是他为勃起障碍而跑
is that he's running for erectile dysfunction.

1649
01:20:31,625 --> 01:20:33,498
好消息，布鲁姆先生
Good news, Mr Bloom.

1650
01:20:33,627 --> 01:20:35,868
韧带没有撕裂
No rupture, no ligament damage.

1651
01:20:36,004 --> 01:20:37,581
太好了
Oh, that's great.

1652
01:20:37,714 --> 01:20:38,709
杰克，不要闹了
Jake, please?

1653
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:41,591
其实根本没什么伤
In fact, there's no real damage anywhere.

1654
01:20:42,551 --> 01:20:43,546
你确定吗，医生？
Are you sure, doctor?

1655
01:20:43,677 --> 01:20:45,171
杰克，别闹了
Jake, please.

1656
01:20:45,304 --> 01:20:47,426
这好像是…
It's, uh, like, uh...

1657
01:20:47,556 --> 01:20:48,504
你们运动员怎么说来着？
What is it you runners say?

1658
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,098
撞到墙了
You hit the wall.

1659
01:20:52,018 --> 01:20:53,677
不不，那不可能
No, no, that... That's not possi...

1660
01:20:55,604 --> 01:20:59,019
妈的，能不能别弄床了，你个小兔崽子
God damn it, will you stop...

1661
01:20:56,892 --> 01:20:58,884
messin' around with the bed, you little shit?!

1662
01:21:00,650 --> 01:21:01,729
上帝呀
God.

1663
01:21:08,282 --> 01:21:10,523
晚上好，体育方面的最新消息
Good evening. It's time for a sports update.

1664
01:21:10,659 --> 01:21:12,402
首先是耐克环河赛
Top story, the Nike River Run.

1665
01:21:12,536 --> 01:21:14,362
稍后是对冠军的访谈…
We'll be chatting to the winner a little bit later on...

1666
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:16,903
因为有无数的电子邮件和来电
but first, we've had thousands of e-mails and calls...

1667
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,617
询问神秘运动员的消息
about our mystery runner.

1668
01:21:18,749 --> 01:21:20,408
而我们的报道小组…
Well, I can tell you now, our TV crew...

1669
01:21:20,543 --> 01:21:21,574
已经联系上了他
has just caught up with him.

1670
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:22,658
借光，借光
Excuse me. Sorry.

1671
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:23,957
能不能慢点走？
Will you slow down, please?

1672
01:21:30,051 --> 01:21:31,710
饿不饿？去吃点东西？
You hungry? You wanna get a bite?

1673
01:21:31,844 --> 01:21:33,635
停车！停车！
Stop! Stop!

1674
01:21:33,762 --> 01:21:35,006
下车
Everyone out. Get out.

1675
01:21:36,306 --> 01:21:37,337
-快！ -来了！
- Come on! - I'm goin'!

1676
01:21:38,725 --> 01:21:39,887
走开！
Hey!

1677
01:21:38,634 --> 01:21:39,748
Just go away!

1678
01:21:40,810 --> 01:21:41,972
-谁绊他一下 -走开！
- Somebody trip him. - Go away!

1679
01:21:42,103 --> 01:21:43,347
把他撞到
Knock him over.

1680
01:21:43,479 --> 01:21:45,270
不行，无效，违规
No, invalid. Off-side.

1681
01:21:46,148 --> 01:21:47,939
别碰他！离他远点！
- Oh! - Leave him alone! Get off him!

1682
01:21:48,067 --> 01:21:49,774
要不现在陪钱！
I want my money now!

1683
01:21:49,901 --> 01:21:51,442
别听他们的，丹尼斯！
Don't listen to them, Dennis!

1684
01:21:51,570 --> 01:21:52,565
你是胜利者！
You are a winner!

1685
01:21:52,696 --> 01:21:53,727
要不现在赔钱！
I want my money now!

1686
01:21:53,863 --> 01:21:56,270
别扔了！我有头盔！
Stop it! I'm wearing helmet!

1687
01:21:56,407 --> 01:21:57,355
离远点！
Clear off!

1688
01:21:57,491 --> 01:21:59,732
所谓“长跑运动员的孤独”
"The loneliness of the long-distance runner"...

1689
01:21:59,868 --> 01:22:03,117
正是丹尼斯・道尔的真实写照
a phrase epitomized by this man, Dennis Doyle.

1690
01:22:03,246 --> 01:22:08,203
他拖着重伤的脚踝跑完了之前的十一英里
For the last eleven miles, he's been running...

1691
01:22:04,947 --> 01:22:08,066
on what appears to be a severely sprained ankle.

1692
01:22:08,334 --> 01:22:11,500
真是对人类精神力量的伟大见证
What a testament to the power of the human spirit.

1693
01:22:11,629 --> 01:22:13,087
道尔先生，你现在感觉如何？
Mr Doyle, how do you feel?

1694
01:22:13,213 --> 01:22:14,541
你他妈觉得我感觉如何？
How the fuck do you think I feel?

1695
01:22:14,673 --> 01:22:15,953
多么发人深省
What an inspiration.

1696
01:22:16,091 --> 01:22:18,759
我们将继续为您带来最新报道
We'll keep you updated as this story progresses.

1697
01:22:18,885 --> 01:22:20,676
-别他娘挡路！ -抱歉
- Get out of the bloody way! - Sorry.

1698
01:22:20,887 --> 01:22:22,962
-真是值得纪念的一天 -丽碧丽碧，我很抱歉
- Well, what a remarkable day... - Libby. Libby, I'm sorry...

1699
01:22:23,097 --> 01:22:24,804
-这次泰晤士马拉松… -好吗？我失控了，我…
- we've had at the marathon on the Thames... - all right? I lost it. I...

1700
01:22:24,932 --> 01:22:26,556
-比赛的看点… -我昏头了
- with an event dominated as ever... - I wasn't thinking.

1701
01:22:26,684 --> 01:22:28,391
-在于观众和业余选手 -我很抱歉
- By the crowds and the fun runners... - I'm sorry.

1702
01:22:28,518 --> 01:22:30,012
-宝贝，能不能就… -但其中特别引人注目的…
- Honey, can we just... - but particularly by

1703
01:22:30,145 --> 01:22:31,093
-杰克，伙计 -是其中一人
- Jake, buddy... - one man.

1704
01:22:31,229 --> 01:22:33,766
我们要谈话，电视小点声，好吗？
Would you mind just giving us...

1705
01:22:32,220 --> 01:22:33,630
a little peace with the TV, please?

1706
01:22:34,315 --> 01:22:35,263
-谢谢 -加油，丹尼斯！
- Thank you. - Go on, Dennis!

1707
01:22:35,399 --> 01:22:36,347
整个伦敦…
The whole of London...

1708
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:38,725
宝贝，我们能不能谈谈？
Honey, can we just talk about this, please?

1709
01:22:38,819 --> 01:22:42,234
“我们爱丹尼斯”

1710
01:22:42,322 --> 01:22:43,732
-抬头！ -坚持住，伙计！
- Chin up! - Keep it up, mate!

1711
01:22:45,575 --> 01:22:47,069
您认识道尔先生吗？
Do you know, Mr Doyle, sir?

1712
01:22:48,286 --> 01:22:50,029
我是他的助理教练
Oh.

1713
01:22:48,191 --> 01:22:49,898
I'm the assistant coach.

1714
01:22:50,162 --> 01:22:51,739
真的？你是？
Oh. Oh, really. What's your name?

1715
01:22:51,872 --> 01:22:55,038
-古施达施迪达赫 -高施…
- Uh, Mr Ghoshdashtidar. - Gosh...

1716
01:22:55,167 --> 01:22:56,115
-古施… -格施…
- Ghosh... - Gah...

1717
01:22:56,251 --> 01:22:57,875
叫我约翰就好了
OK, just call me John.

1718
01:22:59,212 --> 01:23:02,082
是我发掘了他
It was me who discovered his potential.

1719
01:23:06,718 --> 01:23:08,046
我喘不上气了
I can't breathe.

1720
01:23:08,887 --> 01:23:10,084
头要炸了
My head's gonna explode.

1721
01:23:10,221 --> 01:23:11,798
他跑不完了
He's not gonna make it.

1722
01:23:11,931 --> 01:23:13,508
我得停下了
I... I have to stop.

1723
01:23:13,641 --> 01:23:14,969
-我得停下了 -不
- I have to stop this. - No.

1724
01:23:15,101 --> 01:23:16,180
-对不起 -不，你不能，这是干什么？
- I'm sorry. - No, you can't. What are you doing?

1725
01:23:16,310 --> 01:23:17,472
你不能停，就快到了
You can't stop. You're nearly there.

1726
01:23:17,603 --> 01:23:19,013
真的？还有多远？
What? How much further?

1727
01:23:19,146 --> 01:23:22,479
只有短短的…九英里了
Lt... It's a little, tiny... Nine miles.

1728
01:23:25,777 --> 01:23:27,354
好，好
OK. OK.

1729
01:23:42,917 --> 01:23:44,114
不
Oh, no.

1730
01:23:45,210 --> 01:23:46,324
怎么？
What?

1731
01:23:47,796 --> 01:23:48,993
他撞上了
He's hit it.

1732
01:24:08,522 --> 01:24:10,265
宝贝，该睡觉了
OK, baby, let's get you to bed.

1733
01:24:11,066 --> 01:24:12,014
杰儿
Jakey.

1734
01:24:12,150 --> 01:24:14,189
-…观众和业余的选手 -丹尼斯
...by the crowds and the fun runners. - Dennis.

1735
01:24:14,319 --> 01:24:15,777
-刚打开电视机的朋友 -丹尼斯？
- For those of you just joining us... - Dennis?

1736
01:24:15,904 --> 01:24:18,572
丹尼斯・道尔，这位服装店的保安…
It looks like Dennis Doyle, a clothing store security guard...

1737
01:24:18,698 --> 01:24:20,654
已经跑了十小时四十五分钟…
running for the last ten and three quarter hours...

1738
01:24:20,783 --> 01:24:22,609
依靠着一条腿…
on basically one leg...

1739
01:24:22,743 --> 01:24:26,277
不跑完不休…
is refusing to rest until this race is run.

1740
01:24:26,413 --> 01:24:28,452
令人难以置信！
Unbelievable!

1741
01:24:58,149 --> 01:25:00,983
你这辈子什么都没干完过，丹尼斯
You've never finished anything in your entire life, Dennis.

1742
01:25:03,153 --> 01:25:05,441
你会放弃的
All you're gonna wanna do is give up.

1743
01:25:05,572 --> 01:25:06,852
我可不是轻易放弃的人！
I'm not the quitter!

1744
01:25:06,990 --> 01:25:08,982
你一定会放弃的，丹尼斯
That's exactly what you're gonna do, Dennis.

1745
01:25:09,117 --> 01:25:11,239
好，逃吧！逃吧！
Go on, run away! Run away!

1746
01:25:11,369 --> 01:25:12,910
你只会逃！
That's what you always do!

1747
01:25:16,123 --> 01:25:17,154
丹尼斯！
Dennis!

1748
01:25:19,584 --> 01:25:20,615
丹尼斯！
Dennis!

1749
01:25:24,171 --> 01:25:25,546
丹尼斯？
Dennis?

1750
01:25:33,721 --> 01:25:35,131
真不敢相信
Oh, I don't believe this.

1751
01:25:35,264 --> 01:25:36,592
好，伙计，好！
Yeah, boy, yes!

1752
01:25:36,724 --> 01:25:38,218
他在继续前进！
He's still going!

1753
01:25:38,350 --> 01:25:41,469
加油，你这美人！
Go on, you beautiful man!

1754
01:25:41,603 --> 01:25:43,511
请原谅，女士们先生们…
Apologies there, ladies and gentlemen, uh...

1755
01:25:43,647 --> 01:25:47,726
但在这样激动人心的情景面前 很难保持冷静
but it's, uh, really rather hard not to get caught up...

1756
01:25:46,295 --> 01:25:47,575
in the drama of it all.

1757
01:25:48,818 --> 01:25:51,818
我们再来看一下丹尼斯脚踝受伤的过程
Now let's take one more look at how Dennis broke that ankle.

1758
01:25:51,946 --> 01:25:52,977
就是这个
And here it is.

1759
01:25:53,113 --> 01:25:57,857
看起来与道尔先生身边的选手有关
It appears that the runner there...

1760
01:25:54,510 --> 01:25:57,712
next to Mr Doyle is involved in some way.

1761
01:25:57,992 --> 01:26:01,656
让我们再来看一下…没错
In fact, if we look at it again here... yes!

1762
01:26:01,787 --> 01:26:03,909
是他故意绊的！
He deliberately trips him!

1763
01:26:04,039 --> 01:26:05,580
王八蛋！
Bastard!

1764
01:26:05,708 --> 01:26:06,952
再次请您原谅…
Apologies again, uh...

1765
01:26:07,084 --> 01:26:08,992
那不…不是那样的
That didn't... That's not what happened.

1766
01:26:09,127 --> 01:26:10,585
那…不是那样
That is... That... That didn't happen.

1767
01:26:10,712 --> 01:26:12,289
我真不敢相信
I can't believe this.

1768
01:26:12,422 --> 01:26:13,370
我也不相信
I don't believe it, either.

1769
01:26:13,506 --> 01:26:14,454
我也弄糊涂了
I don't understand that.

1770
01:26:14,590 --> 01:26:15,538
那是怎么回事？
What is that?

1771
01:26:15,675 --> 01:26:17,050
宝贝，宝贝
Honey. Honey...

1772
01:26:17,176 --> 01:26:21,255
从那角度看起来是，但是… 是他绊我
That angle makes it look, but... He tripped me.

1773
01:26:22,389 --> 01:26:24,215
他绊我！是的，是他！
He tripped me! Yes, he did!

1774
01:26:24,349 --> 01:26:27,017
-加油，丹尼斯！ -是他！丹尼斯！
- Go, Dennis! - It's him! Dennis!

1775
01:26:29,061 --> 01:26:30,305
加油，丹尼斯！
Go, Dennis!

1776
01:26:34,024 --> 01:26:35,304
真是的
I can't believe this.

1777
01:26:35,442 --> 01:26:36,639
真的，宝贝
Come on, honey.

1778
01:26:36,776 --> 01:26:38,104
好像我会做那种事似的
Please, like I'm gonna do that.

1779
01:26:38,820 --> 01:26:40,064
你不是开玩笑吧？
What are you... Are you kidding me?

1780
01:26:40,196 --> 01:26:41,310
宝贝
Honey.

1781
01:26:42,907 --> 01:26:44,069
好吧，听我说，我是…
All right, look, I'm just... I'm not...

1782
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:45,657
身不由己，好吗？
I'm not myself, OK?

1783
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:48,527
我身不由己好长时间了
I haven't been myself for a long time.

1784
01:26:48,662 --> 01:26:50,120
我的工作一直…
Work has not been...

1785
01:26:50,997 --> 01:26:52,823
这…
It's, uh...

1786
01:26:52,957 --> 01:26:53,905
就是这个城市的原因
It's just this city, you know?

1787
01:26:54,041 --> 01:26:55,997
我在这里很难受
It's just... It's really hard here for me.

1788
01:26:56,126 --> 01:26:57,667
这里人礼貌得过分
You know, everyone's so polite here...

1789
01:26:57,795 --> 01:26:59,787
还有这里的饭菜，还有车…
and it's like the food and the... and the... and the ca...

1790
01:26:59,921 --> 01:27:01,249
我不知道我怎么了
I just don't... I don't know what happened to me.

1791
01:27:01,381 --> 01:27:03,040
我不知道怎么…是这个地方的原因
I don't know what... It's just this place.

1792
01:27:03,174 --> 01:27:04,253
怪这个地方
It's this place, you know?

1793
01:27:04,384 --> 01:27:07,301
等我们…等我们搬走就好了
And if we... I just know it's gonna be better once we move.

1794
01:27:07,428 --> 01:27:08,969
-搬走？ -到芝加哥
- Move? - To Chicago.

1795
01:27:09,096 --> 01:27:10,293
什么？
What?

1796
01:27:10,431 --> 01:27:11,593
太早了？
Too soon?

1797
01:27:12,808 --> 01:27:14,302
-走，杰克 -丽碧…
Oh!

1798
01:27:12,699 --> 01:27:14,157
- Come on, Jake. - Libby, wh...

1799
01:27:14,434 --> 01:27:15,631
你去哪儿？你去哪儿？
Where you goin'? Where you goin'?

1800
01:27:16,769 --> 01:27:18,642
不会吧，找丹尼斯？
Oh, you got to be kidding me. Dennis?

1801
01:27:18,771 --> 01:27:19,968
这不可能
You can't be serious.

1802
01:27:20,106 --> 01:27:22,976
这家伙在婚礼上把怀孕的你丢下
The guy left you at the altar pregnant.

1803
01:27:24,901 --> 01:27:26,181
谁都有缺点
Nobody's perfect.

1804
01:27:27,404 --> 01:27:28,352
丽碧
Libby.

1805
01:27:28,488 --> 01:27:30,112
丽碧！
Libby! I...

1806
01:27:30,239 --> 01:27:31,234
真是个猪头
What a shithead.

1807
01:27:31,365 --> 01:27:32,396
杰克
Jake.

1808
01:27:33,784 --> 01:27:35,361
我知道你很难受
Hey. I know you feel bad.

1809
01:27:35,494 --> 01:27:36,489
也很痛…
I know you're in incredible pain...

1810
01:27:36,620 --> 01:27:38,991
但你马上就能让我去度假啦
but you are so close to me going on holiday.

1811
01:27:39,915 --> 01:27:40,946
走
Come on.

1812
01:27:56,346 --> 01:27:58,883
丹尼斯！丹尼斯！丹尼斯！
Dennis! Dennis! Dennis!

1813
01:27:59,015 --> 01:28:02,181
丹尼斯！丹尼斯！丹尼斯！
Dennis! Dennis! Dennis!

1814
01:28:02,309 --> 01:28:06,519
丹尼斯！丹尼斯！丹尼斯！
Dennis! Dennis! Dennis!

1815
01:28:06,646 --> 01:28:11,106
距离终点圣・保罗大教堂如此之近 着实令人激动
As we draw tantalizingly close to the finish line...

1816
01:28:09,329 --> 01:28:10,953
here at St. Paul's Cathedral...

1817
01:28:11,233 --> 01:28:15,561
可以说 我和我的摄影师度过了漫长的一天
it's safe to say, it's been a very long day...

1818
01:28:13,665 --> 01:28:15,408
for myself and my cameraman.

1819
01:28:15,696 --> 01:28:18,530
而在家观看的您，也度过了漫长的一天
It's been a very long day for you watching at home...

1820
01:28:18,657 --> 01:28:19,605
但对丹尼斯・道尔来说
but for Dennis Doyle...

1821
01:28:19,741 --> 01:28:22,278
这是他一生中最长的一天
it's been the single longest day of his life.

1822
01:28:37,214 --> 01:28:38,245
加油，丹尼斯！
Come on, Dennis!

1823
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:40,331
干得好，丹尼斯！
Good work, Dennis!

1824
01:28:44,638 --> 01:28:46,132
嘿！跑啊！
Hey! Move along!

1825
01:28:46,264 --> 01:28:47,212
你马上就到了
That's it. You're there.

1826
01:28:47,348 --> 01:28:49,007
还有六十尺
You're sixty feet.

1827
01:28:49,141 --> 01:28:50,421
五十八尺
Fifty... Fifty-eight feet.

1828
01:28:51,519 --> 01:28:52,681
可以说是五十六尺半
Call it fifty-six and a half feet...

1829
01:28:52,811 --> 01:28:53,759
你就要到了，加油
and you're there. Come on.

1830
01:28:53,896 --> 01:28:56,979
这是我伙计！我的伙计！
That's my man! My man!

1831
01:29:05,739 --> 01:29:06,818
加油，加油！
Come on, come on!

1832
01:29:15,790 --> 01:29:16,821
丹尼斯，加油
Dennis, come on.

1833
01:29:19,043 --> 01:29:21,165
趴着吧，踉踉跄跄的
Stay down, you shamble of a man.

1834
01:29:21,294 --> 01:29:22,408
别起来
Don't get up.

1835
01:29:24,589 --> 01:29:25,620

1837
01:29:27,842 --> 01:29:29,336
丹尼斯，你马上到终点了，起来
Dennis, you're at the finish line. Get up.

1838
01:29:30,469 --> 01:29:32,093
丹尼斯，这姿势不雅，大伙说你呢
Dennis, this looks bad. People are talking.

1839
01:29:32,221 --> 01:29:33,252
起来
Get up.

1840
01:29:47,359 --> 01:29:48,390

Go on! You've got it! Go on!

1845
01:30:25,934 --> 01:30:28,056
跑啊，丹尼斯！
Come on, Dennis! Yeah!

1846
01:30:31,945 --> 01:30:32,940
Yeah!

1847
01:30:37,736 --> 01:30:38,767
爸！
Dad!

1848
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:42,025
你这样做真傻
That was a really stupid thing you did out there today.

1849
01:30:42,157 --> 01:30:43,948
别去芝加哥
Don't go to Chicago.

1850
01:30:44,075 --> 01:30:45,616
爸，你赢了！
Dad, you won!

1851
01:30:50,122 --> 01:30:51,402
他成功了！
He's done it!

1852
01:30:51,540 --> 01:30:53,199
他真的成功了！
He's actually done it!

1853
01:30:53,333 --> 01:30:54,412
今天早上…
This morning...

1854
01:30:54,542 --> 01:30:57,992
丹尼斯・道尔还是北伦敦 一位默默无闻的店员
Dennis Doyle was a humble shop worker from North London!

1855
01:30:58,129 --> 01:31:00,666
今晚，他已成为英雄
Tonight, he goes home a hero!

1856
01:31:00,677 --> 01:31:02,384
Oh, yay.

1857
01:31:02,674 --> 01:31:03,871
看啊！
And look at that!

1858
01:31:04,009 --> 01:31:05,123
-妈的 -这位伟大的人
- God damn it. - This extraordinary man...

1859
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:07,133
摊倒在了…
collapses into the arms of...

1860
01:31:07,262 --> 01:31:09,669
看回放应该是…他心爱的女人怀中
I think it's backwards here... the woman he loves!

1861
01:31:09,806 --> 01:31:12,261
看啊！他有个儿子！
And, look! He's got a son!

1862
01:31:12,391 --> 01:31:14,383
我不知道他还有个儿子！
I didn't know he had a son!

1863
01:31:14,518 --> 01:31:16,059
你知道他有儿子吗？
Did you know he had a son?

1864
01:31:27,363 --> 01:31:29,106
-早上好，丹尼斯 -嘿
- Hello, Dennis. - Hey.

1865
01:31:42,709 --> 01:31:44,203
-嗨 -嗨

1866
01:31:44,336 --> 01:31:45,995

1867
01:31:46,129 --> 01:31:47,623
你怎么样？
How's it goin'?

1868
01:31:47,755 --> 01:31:48,999
-很好 -好
- Pretty good. - Good.

1869
01:31:49,132 --> 01:31:50,412
-你呢？ -好
- You? - Yeah.

1870
01:31:50,549 --> 01:31:51,959
不错
Yeah, not bad.

1871
01:31:52,092 --> 01:31:53,171
你还跑步吗？
You still running?

1872
01:31:53,302 --> 01:31:55,210
每天都跑，希望没跑错方向
Every day, hopefully in the right direction.

1873
01:31:58,891 --> 01:32:00,432
Yeah. So...

1874
01:32:02,101 --> 01:32:06,014
丽碧，我想…
Um, Libby, I was thinkin', um...

1875
01:32:08,523 --> 01:32:10,930
-嗨，爸 -嘿，你呀
- Hi, Dad. - Hey, you.

1876
01:32:13,861 --> 01:32:14,809
也没什么
Uh, it doesn't matter, actually.

1877
01:32:14,946 --> 01:32:16,143
我…
I'll, um...

1878
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:17,477
我…回头再说
I'll sp... I'll ca... I'll speak to you later.

1879
01:32:17,615 --> 01:32:19,156
-好 -跟妈妈再见

1880
01:32:19,283 --> 01:32:20,362
拜，妈

1881
01:32:20,492 --> 01:32:21,440
拜拜，回头见
Bye. I'll see you later.

1882
01:32:21,576 --> 01:32:22,690
拜
Bye.

1883
01:32:33,128 --> 01:32:35,036
丽碧，不知道你能不能…
Libby, I was wondering, would you like to go...

1884
01:32:35,172 --> 01:32:37,045
下周和我一起吃顿饭…
and have some dinner with me next week?

1885
01:32:42,178 --> 01:32:43,126
你不一定非得…
You don't have to. It's not, uh...

1886
01:32:43,262 --> 01:32:44,424
好
Yeah.

1887
01:32:44,555 --> 01:32:45,835
啊？
Uh... huh?

1888
01:32:45,973 --> 01:32:47,467
我是说太好了
I mean, wow.

1889
01:32:47,599 --> 01:32:48,678
这很好
It'd be nice.

1890
01:32:48,808 --> 01:32:50,634
是啊，会很好的
Yeah. Well, it would be.

1891
01:32:54,981 --> 01:32:56,724
我…给你打电话
I'll, um... I'll give you a call.

1892
01:32:56,857 --> 01:32:57,852
好
OK.

1893
01:32:57,983 --> 01:32:59,441
我也不知道做这手势干嘛…
Don't know why I did that. It's just...

1894
01:33:01,069 --> 01:33:02,349
好，可以走了？
OK. Ready?

1895
01:33:02,487 --> 01:33:03,518

1896
01:33:06,032 --> 01:33:07,823
好啊！
Hello!

1897
01:33:07,950 --> 01:33:09,444
好啊，丹尼斯！
Hello, Dennis!

1898
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:12,317
古先生
Mr G.

1899
01:33:12,913 --> 01:33:14,821
-你好，杰克 -你好
- Hello, Jake. - Hello.

1900
01:33:14,956 --> 01:33:16,533
我刚从单车课回来
I was just doing my spin class.

1901
01:33:16,666 --> 01:33:17,614
很有意思吧
It's great fun, isn't it?

1902
01:33:17,750 --> 01:33:20,157
真是很棒的锻炼方法
Oh, it's an amazing workout!

1903
01:33:26,466 --> 01:33:28,125
爸爸落后于这位年轻的选手
Dad comin' up behind the young contender.

1904
01:33:28,259 --> 01:33:29,421
来！杰克！
Come on! Jake!

1905
01:33:29,552 --> 01:33:31,129
他从杰克那儿抢下了球！
Oh, he takes the ball from Jake!

1906
01:33:31,262 --> 01:33:33,633
他拿到了球！他无人防守！
He has the ball! He's clear!

1907
01:33:33,764 --> 01:33:35,092
爸！传球！
Dad! Pass it!

1908
01:33:36,558 --> 01:33:37,506
爸爸无人防守！
Dad is clear!

1909
01:33:37,643 --> 01:33:39,350
传啦
Give it!

1910
01:33:39,478 --> 01:33:41,269
我再传给你
I'll give you one, too.

1911
01:33:41,396 --> 01:33:43,435
好，来，好球
OK, let's go. Good game.

1912
01:33:43,564 --> 01:33:45,188
杰克传给古先生
Jake to Mr G.

1913
01:33:46,067 --> 01:33:47,477
非常感谢
Yeah, thank you very much.

1914
01:33:47,610 --> 01:33:48,689
接球，古先生
Take over, Mr G.

1915
01:33:49,987 --> 01:33:51,149
给你，古先生
There you go, Mr G.

1916
01:33:52,072 --> 01:33:54,858
好了，我要恶意犯规了
All right, I'm gonna... Completely illegal move there.

1917
01:33:54,991 --> 01:33:56,782
举起这位球员，抗着他跑
Picks up the player, runs with him.

1918
01:33:56,909 --> 01:33:58,237
扛着他一直跑
Runs with him all the way.

1919
01:33:58,369 --> 01:33:59,863
爸，犯规啦！
Dad, that's illegal!

1920
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:05,781
这还没有完
But that's not all.

1921
01:34:06,543 --> 01:34:08,499
这人已经不能走路…
Because the guy, he can't barely walk, OK...

1922
01:34:08,628 --> 01:34:10,584
更别说跑，但他坚持了…
let alone run, but he keeps going...

1923
01:34:10,713 --> 01:34:13,499
二十五里路，拖着扭伤的脚踝
and twenty-five miles on a shattered ankle.

1924
01:34:13,632 --> 01:34:14,627
知道他是怎么做到的？
And you know how he did that?

1925
01:34:14,758 --> 01:34:17,082
是什么让他坚持下来的？
You know what he said was the one thing...

1926
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:16,915
that kept him going?

1927
01:34:18,303 --> 01:34:19,547
是他的教练从没有放弃他
His trainer never gave up on him.

1928
01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:21,470
一路陪着他
He stayed with him the whole way.

1929
01:34:21,598 --> 01:34:22,546
那人是你？
And that was you?

1930
01:34:22,682 --> 01:34:23,713
是啊
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

1931
01:34:23,850 --> 01:34:25,427
的确是个好故事
It's a pretty amazing story, actually.

1932
01:34:25,559 --> 01:34:26,934
我这儿有些香槟…
I've got a bottle of champagne opened here...

1933
01:34:27,061 --> 01:34:28,092
如果你们想继续听的话
if you wanna hear it.

1934
01:34:29,855 --> 01:34:30,886
-好 -好
- Sure. - Sure.

1935
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:32,554
那么上来吧
Well, come on up then.
