Enter ye, enter ye.

20
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,700
Thank you, sir.

21
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:57,100
Oh, and thanks for
sending your limo, sir.

22
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,200
Oh, pish! Sit ye, sit ye.

23
00:03:00,433 --> 00:03:01,600

-Oh, no...

00:03:04,433 --> 00:03:05,767
Excellent.

26
00:03:05,867 --> 00:03:10,100
Well, Bottle, you had quite
a day yesterday, didn't you?

27
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,433
Not bad, sir. Better than
a hefty kick in the trousers.

28
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:16,667
Oh, come on.
Boast ye, boast ye!

29
00:03:16,767 --> 00:03:19,500
Due to your ability to
ferret out great works of art

30
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,600
in the country houses
of some mad, short-sighted,
old sock knitters,

31
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,933
you've made this firm
£50,000,000 in clear profit.

32
00:03:29,067 --> 00:03:32,500
Well, not quite, sir.
Not once we've paid the
old ladies back their share.

33
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,833
Oh, yes.

34
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:36,467
Now, I wanted to talk to
you about this, Bernard.

35
00:03:36,567 --> 00:03:38,233
Do you mind if
I call you Bernard?

36
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,133
No, sir. Bernie, if you like.

37
00:03:40,967 --> 00:03:42,467
Yes.

38
00:03:42,567 --> 00:03:44,900
Well, the fact is

39
00:03:45,067 --> 00:03:49,133
Bernard, I haven't quite
mastered this refund bit.

40
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:50,600
Elucidate ye.

41
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,400
BERNARD: Well, sir,

42
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,733
I bought the paintings
for a song,

43
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:57,933
but I always said that
if they turned out
to be really valuable,

44
00:03:58,067 --> 00:04:01,067
we'd pay the owners
back properly.

45
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,967
Obviously not the full amount,
because if we hadn't
found them,

46
00:04:03,067 --> 00:04:05,467
the old ladies in question
wouldn't have got anything.

47
00:04:05,567 --> 00:04:06,767
That's a good point, Bernard.

48
00:04:06,867 --> 00:04:10,667
That's a fully-fledged
bastard of a good point.

49
00:04:10,767 --> 00:04:12,700
Yes, so, now that
we've sold them,

50
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,800
I thought we'd
return half the money
to the lovely old birds.

51
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,167
Oh, I see. Excellent!

52
00:04:18,267 --> 00:04:24,367
So, you're suggesting we
return £25,000,000 to
the aforementioned old bats,

53
00:04:24,467 --> 00:04:27,167
and keep a cool
25 mil for ourselves?

54
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,900
That's the ticket, sir.

55
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:30,700
And I've got list of
some other old ladies

56
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,100
who might have
the odd Gainsborough
tucked away in their attic.

57
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,067
-Have you?
-BERNARD: Yes.

58
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,633
Good. Good.

59
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:43,200
I like the cut of
your jib, Bottle.

60
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,667
I've been watching you

61
00:04:44,767 --> 00:04:47,267
and I've thinking about
your future with the firm.

62
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:48,833
-Thank you, sir.
-PINKWORTH: Yes.

63
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:51,733
I'm already assessing
the prospects for the staff

64
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:55,100
and so, naturally, my thoughts
have turned to you.

65
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:56,800
Have they, sir?

66
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,767
Yes, they have, Bernard,
and I've made a big decision.

67
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:03,567
And what's that, sir?

68
00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:05,833
You're fired.

69
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,933
Sorry, sir?

70
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:12,600
Fired, Bottle. I sack ye.

71
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:18,467
I want you and your
philanthropic little arse
out of this building pronto

72
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:20,767
or I'll have you
arrested for loitering

73
00:05:20,867 --> 00:05:23,533
and probably throw
a charge of sexual harassment
into the bargain.

74
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:24,933
I'm not with you, sir.

75
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:26,433
Not any more, you're not.

76
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:28,300
And if I have
anything to do with it,

77
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,100
you won't be with
anyone else either.

78
00:05:31,267 --> 00:05:33,067

79
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:35,667

I write to warn you against
employing a Mr B Bottle,

83
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,333
whom I've just caught
attempting to steal...

84
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:48,067
Notice "steal" there, Bottle.

85
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:50,433

86
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:53,300
Don't even interview him.

00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,867

88
00:05:54,967 --> 00:05:58,800

pen has disappeared.

on my secretary, who looks
distinctly harassed, sexually.

Bottle.

92
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,900
Yes, sir.

93
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:20,500

94
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,933
No. It's a true blue stinker.

96

our doors again.

And I remember looking
at you then.

187
00:12:55,967 --> 00:13:01,100
And I remember thinking
that Christmas must have
been made for us.

this is the time of the year

Seems to have been
some sort of explosion, sir.

Good Lord, how am I?

197
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,233
Do I still look vaguely human

Julian Lloyd Webber?

Don't you worry, sir,
I had a friend who had
both his legs blown off

203
00:13:37,167 --> 00:13:38,733
and he was up
and walking around
in a fortnight.

-Not exactly, sir.

last night, Kepple.

That's fine, sir.
They didn't nickname me
Sticky Kepple for nothing.

Your nickname was
Sticky Kepple?

No sir, it wasn't.

Yeah, I'm worried
about him too, baby.

00:18:57,767 --> 00:19:00,767
This guy is my best friend.
I'd do anything
not to hurt him.

00:19:06,967 --> 00:19:07,967
I know.

285
00:19:08,933 --> 00:19:10,533
I know.

286
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:13,933
But you know, baby,
Bernard's always lived in
a bit of a dream world.

287
00:19:14,067 --> 00:19:17,367
I mean, I love this man,
but he looked like a turnip.

288
00:19:17,467 --> 00:19:22,167
If what you say is true,
he had all the sexual skills
of a small Dutch cheese.

289
00:19:22,267 --> 00:19:24,233
Well, a medium-size
Dutch cheese.

290
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:27,433
And yet he still thought
he could go out with
a goddess like you.

Fact is that some time
Bernard's gotta come down
to earth.

it's a tough dog-stabs-dog-

The sooner Bernie faces
up to reality the better.

yourself properly?

And what a condition
this place is in.

On second thought,
no offence, Mum,
I wish she couldn't.

00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,633
I have to be very careful,
don't I?

304
00:20:09,733 --> 00:20:12,500
Yes, say the words "I wish"
with the caution you would

305
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,167
normally reserve for
"please castrate me".

306
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:16,933
Yes.

Oh, this could be brilliant.

00:20:19,467 --> 00:20:22,067

sort out just exactly how
it's going to work.

00:20:26,567 --> 00:20:30,633
Things must have
changed somewhat
since you were last out.

312
00:20:30,733 --> 00:20:34,200

how's old Caesar?

Caesar?

00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:36,533
Yes, the emperor.

315
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,233
Uh, well, you see, he's dead.

316
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:40,300
No, what happened?

317
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,633
He was stabbed in the capital.

318
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:43,900
God. So who's in charge now?
Brutus?

319
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
No, he's dead too.

320
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,200
Wow, a real massacre.

321
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,467
Yeah.

322
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:55,967
Look, um, there's something
I think I ought to explain.

323
00:20:56,067 --> 00:21:00,667
You see, you've obviously
been inside the lamp slightly
longer than you think.

00:21:02,433 --> 00:21:05,833
Well, give or take
a day or two,
two thousand years.

No.

327
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:09,500
Two thousand years?

328
00:21:10,567 --> 00:21:12,833
Most of my friends will
be dead.

a more likely guess.

00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:16,467
Yes, and my girlfriend,

331
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:19,067
my mother, my father,
my sister.

332
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,800

-I'm very sorry.
-No, no. I'm the one who
should be sorry.

around the place is
a gloomy genie.

Go ahead, make some wishes.
Go ahead. I'll be fine.

00:21:51,933 --> 00:21:53,767
Everything has been
pretty crappy.

342
00:21:53,867 --> 00:21:58,733
I just got sacked and then
found out that my fiancée was
sleeping with my best friend.

343
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,133
Do you wish me to kill them?

344
00:22:01,233 --> 00:22:03,833
Um, no, that's not really
the way we do things
any longer.

345
00:22:03,933 --> 00:22:06,533
Well, how do you deal with
your enemies these days?

346
00:22:06,633 --> 00:22:09,233
Well, um, we kinda
don't see them,

347
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:11,067
you know, sort of spurn them.
Spurn them.

348
00:22:11,167 --> 00:22:15,133
And, then the odd
nasty look, kind of,
uh, the sarcastic remark,

349
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:19,067
and then we kind of encourage
our other friends, you know,
not to see them,

350
00:22:19,167 --> 00:22:21,200
and to be a bit sarcastic too.

351
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:23,133
That's it?

352
00:22:24,467 --> 00:22:26,067
So, it's not
all progress then?

353
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:30,700
Still, don't get
too depressed.
Look on the bright side,

354
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,500
your fiancée is
buried in the arms of
your best friend.

355
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,100
Mine is buried in an artichoke
patch in Jerusalem.

356
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,400
Good point.

357
00:22:40,867 --> 00:22:43,533
I know, I wish you weren't
so depressed.

358
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,500
No, it doesn't work.
You can't change people's
feelings with wishes.

Oh, dear.

360
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,067
Then we're in trouble,
aren't we?

361
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,467
What say we have
a bite to eat?

362
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,900
How does a hamburger grab you?

363
00:23:26,633 --> 00:23:27,533
A what?

364
00:23:27,633 --> 00:23:30,700
Oh, well, it's
two all-beef patties,

365
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:35,500

cheese, pickles, onions,
in a sesame seed bun.

366
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,333
Mmm.
I might take out the pickles.

367
00:23:38,433 --> 00:23:39,467
You wouldn't be the first.

368
00:23:39,567 --> 00:23:40,867

369
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,200

370
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,200
Um, take it out of
the box first.

371
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,300
Everybody dead,
all I ever wanted
was to get out of the lamp.

372

Now, I almost wish I hadn't.

373
00:24:02,933 --> 00:24:08,500
On the other hand,
bite my beetroot,
that is fantastic!

374
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,500
You get the right price,
you could sell
hundreds of these.

375
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,900
Well, they do sell
quite a few.

376
00:24:14,067 --> 00:24:16,667
There's a difference
about this people will enjoy.

377
00:24:16,767 --> 00:24:18,433

No, something

with this music

this guy, Bernie?

It's a chap called Mozart.

Incredible!

And I've been
worrying about it.

Do either of you think
I was a little harsh on him?

Well, sir, I think perhaps
you might have given
him a warning?

been worrying,

at work,

any transport.

by this.

in the landing.

a little more practise.

Look, uh, before we go
any further,

461
00:29:01,733 --> 00:29:02,833
I think we should do
something about the clothes.

hotter than this.

we have at this time of year.

goes around with
his flying reindeer,

516
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,433

and gives children presents.

for Christmas?

A car and a train
and three Nintendos.

also nice, isn't it?

come down chimneys,

who gives the presents.

Indeed. Would you care to
join us for a shake of milk

555

organise something more formal

-She does. A little
more negotiation,

Might I recommend a priest?
Either that or a publisher.

are always big sellers.

there's no reply.

up but put down straight away.

has returned to the flat.

with us, Sunshine.

701
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:58,867
Certainly! You know, he's
really tiny but very funny.

702
00:44:58,967 --> 00:45:01,667
Love the uniform. Kinky.

703
00:45:01,767 --> 00:45:05,600
-Spread him!
-Mmm, I was right. Very kinky.

-Don't try and be funny.
-Mmm! Tasty.

Thank you for the

it goes with the pendant?

707

Can I just say before I
answer that, that is an
absolutely splendid beard,

useful if you wore it on

-Here.
-Funny choice. Still, it does
have a certain kooky charm.

I mean, he leaves home at
9:00 am in a Panda car

730
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:49,900
and comes home at midnight
in a plastic bag,

731
00:46:50,067 --> 00:46:53,067
murdered by an
ex-art dealer with a scimitar.

something wrong?

there is, Mr Bottle.

Hello, sir.
What are you doing here?

744
00:47:38,367 --> 00:47:43,367
Well, I just thought I'd pop
around and have a little
drinky with my old pal Bernie.

745
00:47:43,467 --> 00:47:49,933
And I discover this list of
priceless paintings that you
stole from our office.

746

the walls and discovered
this dear lady.

757
00:48:23,833 --> 00:48:25,300
Apparently the painting has
been returned.

758
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,800
-What do you mean, "returned"?
-OFFICER: It's back
in the Louvre.

00:48:29,833 --> 00:48:32,500
I think we owe these
people an apology.

We'll be off now.

764
00:48:44,633 --> 00:48:46,633

I can't think of anything
we'd like to do

765
00:48:46,733 --> 00:48:49,433
less than hang around
with scum like you.

766
00:48:51,333 --> 00:48:53,067
Come again, Sunshine?

767
00:48:53,167 --> 00:48:54,967
Yes, you're obviously
a slime bag

768

directly related to the slug.

769

And your face looked familiar
when I first saw it,

770
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:02,400
and now I remember seeing
something very similar whilst

771

quarters of a camel!

00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,933

00:49:06,067 --> 00:49:10,367
And you are a very large turd
in a horrible pink shirt.

00:49:10,467 --> 00:49:13,067
I beg your bloody pardon?

775
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,667
Do you wish I'd never
said any of that?

776
00:49:19,833 --> 00:49:20,833
Yes, I do.

777
00:49:22,933 --> 00:49:24,933
Well, goodbye, gentlemen.
It's nice to meet you.

still alive. I'm so pleased
I didn't kill you.

hadn't taken that list.

a drink anytime and give
the PM one from me.

in recent times.

I like commercials.

Fly Fishing by J R Hartley.

812
00:52:34,667 --> 00:52:36,333
Yeah, but originally,

813
00:52:36,433 --> 00:52:38,967
it was supposed to
celebrate the birth of this
chap called Jesus Christ

814
00:52:39,067 --> 00:52:42,233
who was born, well,
about 2,000 years ago.

815
00:52:42,333 --> 00:52:44,133
-Jesus, you say?
-Yeah.

816
00:52:45,167 --> 00:52:47,500
But I knew this guy.

817
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:50,533
-You did not.
-I did! What did he do
to get so famous?

818
00:52:50,633 --> 00:52:52,067
Well, he turned out to be
the son of God.

819
00:52:52,133 --> 00:52:55,467
-No, I thought he was kidding.
-No. True blue.

820
00:52:58,267 --> 00:53:00,800
Damn it. I knew there was
something special about him

821
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:02,500
from the moment
I first met him.

822
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,867
-You met him?
-Of course.

823
00:53:03,967 --> 00:53:05,700
He helped out with the wine
at my brother's wedding.

824
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:13,167
Wait a minute, so you were at
the wedding at Cana.

825
00:53:13,267 --> 00:53:18,167
Well, I think so but by the
end of it I was so completely
legless, I can't be sure.

826
00:53:18,267 --> 00:53:21,633
This is so bizarre.
I told him, you could be
a big money spinner,

827
00:53:21,733 --> 00:53:24,933
but oh, no, goody two-shoes
was having none of it.

828
00:53:25,067 --> 00:53:28,967
One night we're on the boat.
He walks on water.

829
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,600
You were there!

830
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:36,833
One day 5,000 people
came out to see him talk and
they didn't have any food.

831
00:53:36,933 --> 00:53:39,967
-So, guess what he did?
-Produced loaves and
fishes for them all.

832
00:53:40,067 --> 00:53:45,433
Yes. I said, let's open
a restaurant right now. We'll
call it "Something Fishy",

833
00:53:45,533 --> 00:53:47,433
but he didn't like the name.

00:53:47,533 --> 00:53:52,567

A crap businessman
but a great human being.

So, tell me, what
happened to him?

00:53:59,433 --> 00:54:01,967
He was crucified.

00:54:02,067 --> 00:54:05,800
-No! You're kidding?
-BERNARD: Afraid not.

839
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:10,400
Wow. There's no need for that.
This is a wonderful guy.

840
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:16,367
-But being the son of God,
he came back to life again.
-Oh, great! Is he still alive?

841
00:54:16,467 --> 00:54:19,067
Not really, no.
You see, he rose
up into heaven.

842
00:54:19,167 --> 00:54:23,367
Huh. Lucky for you. Jesus was
not keen on people making
money out of religion.

843
00:54:23,467 --> 00:54:26,567
One day I was in the temple
when they tried to turn it
into a supermarket.

844
00:54:26,667 --> 00:54:29,100
Jesus went
in there and kicked arse.

845
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,700
Like Arnold Schwarzenegger?

846
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,067
Yes, but with
smaller pectorals.

847
00:54:33,167 --> 00:54:36,800
Yeah, well, unfortunately,
it seems the big money
people are taking over.

848
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:39,067
Hmm, but it's time for the no
money people to strike back.

849
00:54:39,167 --> 00:54:41,567
Let's make some
wishes for Big J, his way.

You're the boss. Let's do it!

00:56:27,067 --> 00:56:29,867
Now what about you?
What would you like
for Christmas?

870
00:56:29,967 --> 00:56:34,100
-Well, I have had one
or two little thoughts.
-Oh, good.

the cracking of
a major drugs ring.

879

Kevin Bell,
the city financier,

880
00:57:07,233 --> 00:57:11,400
was found with 30 pounds
of marijuana stored
under his bed.

881
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:15,667
-Look, it's a plant.
-I think you'll find it's a
hundred plants, actually.

882
00:57:15,767 --> 00:57:19,800
-More like a thousand.
-Will if it was all there, why
didn't he ever give me any?

883
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:21,400
-Tragic.
-Really terrible.

884
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,667
And they look such
a nice couple.

And finally, a charming
Christmas story.

886
00:57:26,167 --> 00:57:30,067
This evening, the Queen
received an unexpected letter
at Buckingham Palace.

887
00:57:30,133 --> 00:57:33,067
It included a cheque from arts
dealer, Charles Pinkworth,

-donating £100,000,000

-BOTH: £100,000,000.

-Mr Charles Pinkworth?
-Yes?

What made you
make this extraordinary
generous gesture?

893
00:57:52,567 --> 00:57:53,833
What gesture?

894
00:57:53,933 --> 00:57:55,867
BOTH: £100,000,000!

895
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:58,200
The £100,000,000

Yes. Well, Christmas is very
much a time for giving

908
00:58:33,267 --> 00:58:38,900
and I thought it was about
time that somebody from
the commercial sector

909
00:58:39,067 --> 00:58:41,767
put their money where
their mouth was

910
00:58:41,867 --> 00:58:46,767

for that guy who's married
to Esther Rantzen.

Maybe.

But now, you know,
I'm as happy as Michelle
