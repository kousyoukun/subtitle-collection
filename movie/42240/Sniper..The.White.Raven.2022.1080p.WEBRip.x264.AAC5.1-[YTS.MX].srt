3
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:08,708
I'll be late...

4
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:28,625
So. Let's go!

5
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,375
Good morning.

6
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,042
Good morning, Taras.

7
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,167
- Good morning!
- Good afternoon!

8
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:33,875
Good morning!

9
00:05:36,792 --> 00:05:37,875
Good...

10
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,083
Good afternoon.

11
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:45,667
Good morning!

12
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,208
- Is that my journal?
- Yes, take it.

13
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:52,833
Mykola, you have something on your cheek.

14
00:05:52,917 --> 00:05:56,708
Yanukovych refused to sign
an agreement with the EU

15
00:05:56,792 --> 00:05:58,958
and set a course
for improving relations with Russia.

16
00:05:59,042 --> 00:06:01,708
The largest protest took place
on Maidan in Kyiv,

17
00:06:01,792 --> 00:06:05,625
the special forces killed
more than 100 protesters.

18
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,042
Look, a sniper...

19
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:16,750
President of Ukraine,
Viktor Yanukovych fled to Russia,

20
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,708
leaving his post as Commander-in-Chief.

21
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:20,208
Crimea was completely captured

22
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:22,875
and taken under the control
of the Russian Federation.

23
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:26,292
CRIMEA

24
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:25,417
Velocity is a physical quantity

25
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:27,958
that characterizes the motion

26
00:07:28,542 --> 00:07:33,000
and distance that
an object travels per unit of time.

27
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:36,375
The velocity is calculated

28
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:41,000
by the formula V=S/t.

29
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:44,417
Where V is the speed...

30
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,500
- Are you a moron?
- Shut your mouth, faggot!

31
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:49,583
Ivan...

32
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,083
S is distance.

33
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,750
And t is time.

34
00:08:15,042 --> 00:08:16,958
Can you hit in the same place again?

35
00:08:17,042 --> 00:08:18,833
RESET TIMER?

36
00:08:34,292 --> 00:08:35,958
0.9 seconds.

37
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,625
I measured a distance of seven meters.

38
00:08:43,292 --> 00:08:46,833
Ivan, what is the speed?

39
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,833
Taras...

40
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,875
7.8 meters per second.

41
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:56,833
Yes.

42
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,667
It was at this speed

43
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,750
that Ivan spat out a piece of paper.

44
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,083
Well, Ivan...

45
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:17,375
if the time is not 0.9, but 0.7

46
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,917
at the same distance...

47
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:21,917
What would the speed be?

48
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:25,708
Write the answer on the board.

49
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,208
Is there an answer?

50
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:05,667
Now it's clear
what you are distracted by...

51
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,417
Goodbye.

52
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,042
Goodbye, Taras.

53
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,000
Listen, digger...

54
00:10:35,917 --> 00:10:36,833
I'm sorry?

55
00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:41,708
You're a stranger here, get out.

56
00:10:56,292 --> 00:10:57,208
Lyosha, are you ready?

57
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:58,792
Yes.

58
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:03,458
The Voronenko family
are the first eco-settlers in Donbas.

59
00:11:03,542 --> 00:11:07,167
A year ago,
they registered a two-hectare plot of land

60
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,917
near Horlivka
and moved to live in a field.

61
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,958
Mykola has three higher education degrees,
mathematician, physicist, and ecologist.

62
00:11:14,042 --> 00:11:16,708
Explain what caused
you to take such a radical step?

63
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:21,458
As an ecologist, I understand
that difficult times await us.

64
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:26,292
Only by changing the harmful way
of life to an ecological one,

65
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,417
can we have a chance
to save the planet and ourselves.

66
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,333
How long do you plan to live here?

67
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:37,083
We want to have and raise a child here.

68
00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:38,750
Is your wife pregnant?

69
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:39,667
Yes.

70
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,625
This means
everything will work out just fine.

71
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:47,583
Tell me, what is this sign?

72
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,083
This is our ancestral sign.

73
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,792
And what does it mean?

74
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,125
Paw of a white raven.

75
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:58,667
Will you tell me?

76
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:05,042
- This is... an ancient...
- Get the microphone closer.

77
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Let me hold it.

78
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:09,958
...legend...

79
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:15,458
Raven created the world
out of darkness, waving his wings.

80
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:19,625
And the world is
a black ocean with a shore,

81
00:12:20,417 --> 00:12:22,375
where people will soon come to live.

82
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:28,000
The raven, feeling pity for the people,

83
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,875
turns the ocean's salty water
into fresh water and food,

84
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,042
but in return...

85
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:37,000
sacrifices its snow-white feathers.

86
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,375
Thank you.

87
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,250
Lesha, stop.

88
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,875
Come on in, now I'll show you inside...

89
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:48,625
And this is a windmill.

90
00:12:49,292 --> 00:12:52,250
I can tell you later about it,
by the way, I made it myself.

91
00:12:58,417 --> 00:13:00,542
Shall we start with a dynamo machine?

92
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,833
I'll show you how it works...

93
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,042
See?

94
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:18,292
Lyosha, film just a few more details
and these sketches.

95
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:38,417
And you're not afraid to give birth here?

96
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,125
No, I'm not afraid.

97
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,375
Hmm...

98
00:13:51,417 --> 00:13:52,292
Lena,

99
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,000
- I hope we are done?
- Yes, we're done.

100
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:59,000
- I haven't shown you everything yet--
- Nikolai, thank you, we've had enough.

101
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,458
Two crazy people.

102
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:19,375
Something fell out.

103
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,167
We do not throw trash here.

104
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,292
Goodbye.

105
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,167
Let's go.

106
00:14:38,042 --> 00:14:38,875
Don't worry,

107
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,667
someday everything
will come back to normal.

108
00:15:04,292 --> 00:15:08,125
Come with me, my dear love

109
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:12,292
To a place with shining stars

110
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:16,333
There are rivers, mountains live on love

111
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:20,333
The birds sing for us

112
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:24,667
Your eyes are shining like emeralds

113
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:28,375
And disappeared
In the misfortune of summer

114
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:34,667
I will give you the whole world

115
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:38,667
And a daughter with the name Nastya

116
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:44,250
I will give you the whole world

117
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,625
And a daughter with the name...

118
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:51,167
Nastya...

119
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,250
This is for you from us.

120
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:13,792
Your Little Angel.

121
00:16:15,792 --> 00:16:17,333
Will protect you.

122
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,125
Buriy, we pass the line.

123
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,958
Confirmed. Chevrons.

124
00:17:29,792 --> 00:17:36,792
CAUTION!
STATE BORDER OF UKRAINE. NO PASSAGE.

125
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,208
Get up, be fast!

126
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:05,000
Yes, I'm coming, I'm coming...

127
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,250
Bye.

128
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,542
Oh, a normal engine!

129
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,500
Flying!

130
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,375
I'm flying...

131
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,167
Yes, everything was canceled.

132
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:47,167
No, I don't know...

133
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,625
Maybe it won't be...

134
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,417
Yes, I'll close it.

135
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,458
This morning, an unknown bus stopped

136
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:04,125
near the Horlivka Police Department
in the Donetsk region.

137
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:07,083
It is also noted that
armed militants in balaclavas

138
00:20:07,167 --> 00:20:09,792
and pro-Russian activists

139
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,292
continue to maintain the buildings
of regional state administrations

140
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,167
in Slovyansk, Kramatorsk, and Donetsk.

141
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:18,500
And...

142
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,708
It just became clear
that special forces of GUR

143
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:24,083
of the Russian Federation took part

144
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:28,250
in the capture
of the Rada Verkhovna of Crimea.

145
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,667
Take your hands off of her!

146
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:05,917
Who are you?

147
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,667
Bitch!

148
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,625
What are you doing here, khokhlyara?

149
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,875
I'm a teacher, I live here.

150
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:27,958
Are you a pacifist or something?

151
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,875
- Who is he?
- My husband.

152
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,083
In Russian, fuck, just talk!

153
00:21:35,917 --> 00:21:36,750
Husband...

154
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:39,500
Don't touch her, she is pregnant!

155
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:41,958
And what is this?

156
00:21:42,042 --> 00:21:43,375
Those are my drawings.

157
00:21:43,917 --> 00:21:46,958
Look at her face, she's definitely a spy!

158
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:57,167
Stand!

159
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,833
Don't squeal!

160
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:12,875
Everyone, let's go.

161
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:15,083
What about him?

162
00:23:15,167 --> 00:23:16,167
We are leaving, I said.

163
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,083
Bitch!

164
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:37,833
Fuck!

165
00:23:43,792 --> 00:23:45,042
Get in the car quickly.

166
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:54,792
Please don't die...

167
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:56,167
Don't die, I'm here...

168
00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:00,208
I'm here with you. No, no...

169
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:01,708
No!

170
00:25:58,125 --> 00:25:59,000
Local?

171
00:26:02,042 --> 00:26:02,958
Documents?

172
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:08,583
In the bag.

173
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,125
Who is she?

174
00:26:20,042 --> 00:26:20,917
Wife.

175
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:28,625
Mykola Voronenko...

176
00:26:33,667 --> 00:26:34,833
Looks like he is ours.

177
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:26,458
Come on.

178
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:17,833
I don't care what happened there!

179
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:20,750
Why the fuck is he here?

180
00:29:21,417 --> 00:29:24,417
So, I should have left him
in the middle of the field?

181
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,583
I do not understand.
And if it's their spy?

182
00:29:27,667 --> 00:29:29,292
Have you thought about that?

183
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:31,708
Well, of course,
you haven't thought about it.

184
00:29:31,792 --> 00:29:34,875
Your head just doesn't work that way.

185
00:29:34,958 --> 00:29:36,333
But you are clearly not aware of that.

186
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:42,833
So, listen to me carefully.
Take him away from here as far as...

187
00:29:44,167 --> 00:29:45,167
Stop...

188
00:29:45,667 --> 00:29:48,000
Did you blindfold him
when you drove him to us?

189
00:29:50,375 --> 00:29:52,625
What? Do you have no brain at all?

190
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:57,458
You leaked our base to him, you idiot!

191
00:29:58,208 --> 00:30:00,750
Should I shoot him now?

192
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:03,792
Ah, go away... you motherfucker!

193
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:06,667
Skinny,

194
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:10,667
what did I tell you?

195
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,708
Go to the toilet
with a weapon in your hand!

196
00:30:13,792 --> 00:30:14,792
That's right!

197
00:30:15,458 --> 00:30:18,417
Why are you reaching for your gun?

198
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:20,542
Do you want to shoot yourself?

199
00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:23,958
We need to drive them out.

200
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:28,292
What did he say?

201
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:35,250
I want to drive them out of our land.

202
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:50,583
- Falcons flutter in the sky.
- Falcons flutter in the sky.

203
00:30:50,667 --> 00:30:54,167
- Our squad flies into battle.
- Our squad flies into battle.

204
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:57,500
- We will defeat the enemies.
- We will defeat the enemies.

205
00:30:57,583 --> 00:31:00,958
- Although they crawl from all sides.
- Although they crawl from all sides.

206
00:31:01,042 --> 00:31:03,333
Come on, guys, come on.

207
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:06,375
Faster. Tempo, tempo I said! Come on!

208
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:14,292
Bad!

209
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:16,500
As you were!

210
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:18,875
Show him.

211
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:34,125
As you were!

212
00:31:35,583 --> 00:31:37,250
That's it, comrade!

213
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,667
Come on, come on, men, faster!

214
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:44,250
Thirty-three,

215
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:46,750
thirty-four...

216
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:49,833
- Thirty-five!
- Keep the body straight.

217
00:31:49,917 --> 00:31:51,375
Thirty-six!

218
00:31:51,458 --> 00:31:53,417
Thirty-seven!

219
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,583
And now have a rest!

220
00:32:03,917 --> 00:32:07,083
Well, do you enjoy being here
as a pacifist?

221
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:10,625
Yes, sir, Mr. Commander!

222
00:32:11,167 --> 00:32:12,583
I'm glad to hear that.

223
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:17,083
Permission to speak, sir, Mr. Commander!

224
00:32:17,583 --> 00:32:18,750
Permitted.

225
00:32:20,542 --> 00:32:23,292
I'm not a pacifist, Mr. Commander.

226
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:26,917
My code name is Raven!

227
00:32:27,542 --> 00:32:29,000
Dead Raven!

228
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:33,500
I said one and a half!

229
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,833
This code name still needs
to be earned, comrade.

230
00:32:44,708 --> 00:32:46,000
Do you understand?

231
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:48,250
Yes, sir, Mr. Commander!

232
00:32:51,042 --> 00:32:51,875
Chief.

233
00:32:57,458 --> 00:32:58,292
Crazy?

234
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,000
Hey, bud, you want tea?

235
00:33:05,833 --> 00:33:06,667
And you?

236
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,792
Don't sleep!

237
00:33:33,542 --> 00:33:35,625
Quickly, quickly...

238
00:33:35,708 --> 00:33:38,333
Girls, don't get caught in your bras!

239
00:33:59,542 --> 00:34:02,542
The war will come to an end while you are
still swarming like a pacifist!

240
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:05,750
Start again! Disassemble!

241
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:18,250
Quickly! Let's not linger!

242
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:20,542
Twenty-eight,

243
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:23,417
twenty-nine...

244
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,875
- Lower!
- Forty...

245
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:08,875
Attention!

246
00:35:09,917 --> 00:35:12,500
There are not enough snipers at the front.

247
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:17,542
Volunteers organize free courses.
Are you interested?

248
00:35:21,833 --> 00:35:24,250
Bad, Klym, Dunay, good.

249
00:35:29,167 --> 00:35:31,250
What? A pacifist? You too? Sit down.

250
00:35:32,458 --> 00:35:34,417
I, private Raven, ask to join!

251
00:35:35,458 --> 00:35:38,917
Listen, you don't know
how to remove a magazine from the AK!

252
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,125
Which of you is a sniper?

253
00:35:44,167 --> 00:35:45,500
Let me show you!

254
00:35:47,833 --> 00:35:51,083
Interesting. And what can you show us?

255
00:35:55,875 --> 00:35:58,458
Disassembly-assembly of AK in 20 seconds.

256
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:03,208
In 20 seconds?

257
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:08,708
This should be fun.

258
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:10,833
Well,

259
00:36:11,917 --> 00:36:13,125
you asked yourself.

260
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:17,458
Come on.

261
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:28,500
Well, warrior... ready?

262
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:42,250
Well.

263
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:45,625
Come on!

264
00:37:05,917 --> 00:37:07,042
Well.

265
00:37:07,542 --> 00:37:09,750
Congratulations to Private Raven...

266
00:37:09,833 --> 00:37:11,542
Eighteen seconds!

267
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:12,875
Well done! Bravo!

268
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:15,542
Well done!

269
00:37:17,708 --> 00:37:19,000
That's what I understand.

270
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:21,708
Find him one SKS.

271
00:37:42,917 --> 00:37:44,625
Right turn! March!

272
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,542
Right turn! March!

273
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:51,000
Nobody likes snipers

274
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:54,167
because they are insidious and elegant.

275
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:59,375
There are no forbidden methods
of waging war for them.

276
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:06,750
Professional snipers work in disguise
without modern special equipment.

277
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,750
Their position
is almost impossible to detect.

278
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:15,583
Especially...

279
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:21,250
if no shots are heard
or they are hidden under another noise.

280
00:38:22,292 --> 00:38:23,167
Excuse me,

281
00:38:24,875 --> 00:38:25,958
what does that mean?

282
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:31,000
In order not to get caught,
the sniper fires his shot

283
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:33,833
during a machine gun fire
or the sound of explosions.

284
00:38:42,292 --> 00:38:43,292
Next!

285
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:45,458
Budkevych.

286
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:56,458
- Next!
- Dunaevsky.

287
00:39:06,458 --> 00:39:07,708
Next!

288
00:39:07,792 --> 00:39:08,667
Voronenko.

289
00:39:16,792 --> 00:39:17,875
Next!

290
00:39:22,083 --> 00:39:24,208
- What is this?
- A horse in a coat!

291
00:39:24,292 --> 00:39:26,833
This is SKS.
"Simonov's self-loading carbine"!

292
00:39:30,417 --> 00:39:31,417
Next!

293
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:33,208
This is a mistake.

294
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:37,000
I have to have an SVD like everybody else.

295
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:42,583
Dear, no need for songs here!
Is it a circus for you here?

296
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:44,417
Do I look like a clown?

297
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,208
This is, the fucking, army!

298
00:39:46,833 --> 00:39:49,417
Your task is to pick up the fucking gun
and get the fuck out of here!

299
00:39:51,125 --> 00:39:52,000
Can I go?

300
00:39:54,375 --> 00:39:57,375
What is this... Blaster, fuck!

301
00:39:57,458 --> 00:40:00,208
And we are all space pirates here,
for fuck's sake!

302
00:40:00,292 --> 00:40:01,208
Don't giggle!

303
00:40:02,667 --> 00:40:07,417
Soldiers, I do not repeat anything twice.

304
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,833
Nobody is going to jerk off with you here!

305
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:13,833
Next!

306
00:40:17,292 --> 00:40:18,167
Look, Raven.

307
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,167
Will you give me your Blaster for a shot?

308
00:40:55,792 --> 00:41:01,208
The basic rule of a sniper is to remain
invisible under any circumstances.

309
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:05,083
If you move, assume you've been killed.

310
00:41:07,667 --> 00:41:08,708
Moved.

311
00:41:09,375 --> 00:41:10,458
Minus one point.

312
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:18,500
Minus.

313
00:41:28,292 --> 00:41:29,125
Minus.

314
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,167
Minus.

315
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:46,000
Have a look
at your 1963 Dragunov sniper rifle.

316
00:41:46,708 --> 00:41:53,333
With its obsolete
7.62 by 54 mm ammunition,

317
00:41:54,625 --> 00:41:58,208
it has a working distance

318
00:41:59,292 --> 00:42:02,083
of approximately 600 meters.

319
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:05,667
In contrast,

320
00:42:06,917 --> 00:42:12,125
modern 8.6 by 70 Lapua Magnum

321
00:42:12,958 --> 00:42:16,708
or 12.7 by 99 BMG...

322
00:42:18,667 --> 00:42:21,375
rifles hit targets...

323
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:24,500
even at 2,000 meters.

324
00:42:27,167 --> 00:42:29,875
And how far does your rifle shoot?

325
00:42:31,167 --> 00:42:36,000
Remington 308 caliber
has a working distance of...

326
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:41,375
about 800 meters.

327
00:42:44,292 --> 00:42:46,375
And if the enemy has a better shot?

328
00:42:46,958 --> 00:42:48,375
Then you are unlucky.

329
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:54,250
This is called a ballistic vulnerability.

330
00:42:57,667 --> 00:42:59,958
But it's not a rifle
that makes a sniper dangerous...

331
00:43:00,958 --> 00:43:03,375
But his intelligence and endurance.

332
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:06,958
The next task...

333
00:43:08,583 --> 00:43:09,583
be ready.

334
00:43:11,167 --> 00:43:14,375
The sniper must always be stable
and focused.

335
00:43:15,333 --> 00:43:16,167
Charge!

336
00:43:19,208 --> 00:43:20,042
Take aim.

337
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:25,083
Ready.

338
00:43:27,167 --> 00:43:29,958
One, two, three... Fire!

339
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:36,042
Plus.

340
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:42,083
Ready.

341
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:45,917
One, two, three... Fire!

342
00:43:50,208 --> 00:43:51,042
Plus.

343
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,875
Ready.

344
00:43:58,417 --> 00:44:00,708
One, two, three... Fire!

345
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,333
Minus.

346
00:44:06,208 --> 00:44:08,125
It's not possible with such a firearm!

347
00:44:11,042 --> 00:44:12,208
Some succeeded.

348
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,167
One of the important skills a sniper

349
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:19,792
has to have is the ability to be able
to calculate quickly in your head.

350
00:44:19,875 --> 00:44:21,458
Your eyes will be occupied
with observing things.

351
00:44:21,958 --> 00:44:23,500
Forget about the calculator.

352
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:25,833
To determine the distance,

353
00:44:25,917 --> 00:44:28,875
you must multiply
the size of the object by 1000

354
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:31,958
and divide by the number
of points in sight.

355
00:44:32,042 --> 00:44:35,625
So the task is to determine
the distance to the KAMAZ.

356
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:39,042
The height of the KAMAZ is 3.45...

357
00:44:40,708 --> 00:44:43,667
and has seven points,

358
00:44:44,458 --> 00:44:45,792
The height
of the armored personnel carrier...

359
00:44:47,708 --> 00:44:49,167
is 2.35...

360
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:53,208
and has 2.5 points.

361
00:44:54,375 --> 00:44:55,542
Tank width...

362
00:44:57,625 --> 00:44:58,958
3.46...

363
00:44:59,625 --> 00:45:00,667
Allow me...

364
00:45:01,292 --> 00:45:02,625
Is something unclear, Raven?

365
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,375
- I want to give the answer.
- Try it.

366
00:45:06,458 --> 00:45:08,917
Distance to KAMAZ is 493 meters.

367
00:45:09,667 --> 00:45:10,917
That's right.

368
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:14,792
940 meters and 804 and a half.

369
00:45:20,292 --> 00:45:22,333
To the armored personnel carrier
and to the tank accordingly.

370
00:45:29,917 --> 00:45:31,000
Not bad, Raven.

371
00:46:07,875 --> 00:46:12,250
Before the shot,
everyone should call his code out loud.

372
00:46:12,333 --> 00:46:14,458
"Code green" for I can shoot.

373
00:46:14,542 --> 00:46:17,208
"Code red" for I can't shoot.

374
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:19,250
Get ready!

375
00:46:20,708 --> 00:46:21,917
Attention!

376
00:46:22,875 --> 00:46:23,792
Three,

377
00:46:24,375 --> 00:46:26,042
two, one...

378
00:46:29,417 --> 00:46:30,333
Code green.

379
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:32,417
Code green.

380
00:46:37,958 --> 00:46:38,958
Bob, minus.

381
00:46:39,458 --> 00:46:40,417
Bad, plus.

382
00:46:40,958 --> 00:46:42,333
Yartur, plus.

383
00:46:42,417 --> 00:46:43,375
Klym, plus.

384
00:46:43,875 --> 00:46:44,875
Mor, minus.

385
00:46:45,417 --> 00:46:46,292
Dunay, plus.

386
00:46:47,292 --> 00:46:48,292
Raven, minus...

387
00:46:48,875 --> 00:46:51,792
Exam completed.
Discharge everyone's weapons.

388
00:47:05,208 --> 00:47:07,500
Raven, haven't you heard the command?

389
00:47:08,833 --> 00:47:10,333
The exam is not over yet.

390
00:47:12,042 --> 00:47:12,875
Why is that?

391
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:15,750
I didn't shoot.

392
00:47:18,125 --> 00:47:19,917
Are you going to wait for dawn?

393
00:47:21,333 --> 00:47:22,208
The code is green!

394
00:47:25,958 --> 00:47:27,417
Wow, holy Blaster!

395
00:47:34,792 --> 00:47:36,042
Plus three, Raven.

396
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:41,583
Thank you for waiting.

397
00:47:45,333 --> 00:47:46,208
Klym!

398
00:47:46,292 --> 00:47:47,167
Yes sir!

399
00:47:47,833 --> 00:47:48,875
Second-class.

400
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:50,667
Congratulations.

401
00:47:51,333 --> 00:47:53,083
I serve the Ukrainian people!

402
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:57,625
Dunay!

403
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:58,667
Yes sir!

404
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:01,125
Third-class. Congratulations.

405
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,458
I serve the Ukrainian people!

406
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:07,500
Raven!

407
00:48:07,583 --> 00:48:08,583
Yes sir!

408
00:48:08,667 --> 00:48:09,750
First-class.

409
00:48:11,042 --> 00:48:11,875
Congratulations.

410
00:48:14,875 --> 00:48:16,667
I serve the Ukrainian people!

411
00:48:18,667 --> 00:48:20,125
- Bad!
- Yes sir!

412
00:48:20,208 --> 00:48:22,500
Second-class. Congratulations...

413
00:48:24,458 --> 00:48:30,167
Tell me, why did this happen?

414
00:48:31,542 --> 00:48:37,792
Why is it that my world
Is not enough for your world?

415
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:45,833
The two of us touched for a moment

416
00:48:47,833 --> 00:48:54,833
And time passes us by craftily

417
00:48:55,958 --> 00:49:01,792
Nobody knows where to go now

418
00:49:03,667 --> 00:49:10,667
Nobody is waiting at home

419
00:49:12,042 --> 00:49:18,458
Dive in, love your will

420
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:26,500
But don't get lost in the pain

421
00:49:27,708 --> 00:49:34,708
And awaken, awaken strength in yourself

422
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:42,500
Build strength in yourself

423
00:49:43,458 --> 00:49:50,167
My dear, my dear...

424
00:49:51,458 --> 00:49:58,458
I wish we had wings...

425
00:50:11,042 --> 00:50:13,208
We need to go to the zero line
to our positions.

426
00:50:13,292 --> 00:50:15,083
Here they captured our checkpoint
on the bridge.

427
00:50:16,042 --> 00:50:17,750
I don't have enough people...

428
00:50:19,833 --> 00:50:22,000
We need to clean up
before they get strengthened.

429
00:50:24,125 --> 00:50:25,167
What do they have?

430
00:50:26,083 --> 00:50:29,042
No armor, nothing heavy. We'll handle it.

431
00:50:30,458 --> 00:50:31,667
And the machine gunners?

432
00:50:33,708 --> 00:50:35,208
Pokemon and RPK.

433
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,583
Okay, take the snipers and assault team.

434
00:50:41,458 --> 00:50:42,292
Plus.

435
00:50:42,875 --> 00:50:43,708
Plus.

436
00:50:53,667 --> 00:50:56,708
- Hello, guys.
- We wish you good health!

437
00:50:59,417 --> 00:51:00,542
- Voron...
- Aye, sir.

438
00:51:01,208 --> 00:51:02,042
Pack up your staff.

439
00:51:03,958 --> 00:51:05,708
Yes, sir, Lieutenant Colonel.

440
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:45,500
Third in position.

441
00:51:47,917 --> 00:51:48,958
First in position.

442
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:53,333
The second is ready.

443
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:10,917
What is the distance?

444
00:52:14,458 --> 00:52:15,542
400 meters.

445
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:22,208
Two up.

446
00:52:34,583 --> 00:52:36,250
Your machine gunner is on the left,

447
00:52:38,417 --> 00:52:39,958
I'm working on the right.

448
00:52:42,375 --> 00:52:43,208
Plus.

449
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:50,000
Ready.

450
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:56,625
Prepared.

451
00:52:57,917 --> 00:52:58,875
Countdown.

452
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:01,625
Plus.

453
00:53:02,875 --> 00:53:03,708
Two,

454
00:53:04,792 --> 00:53:05,625
one...

455
00:53:06,292 --> 00:53:08,083
- Car on 9!
- Stop!

456
00:53:14,208 --> 00:53:16,250
Cap, machine. Two civilians.

457
00:53:29,125 --> 00:53:30,292
Get out of the car!

458
00:53:33,292 --> 00:53:34,125
Documents.

459
00:53:50,875 --> 00:53:54,292
- Give me my passport!
- Watch your hands, bitch!

460
00:54:08,292 --> 00:54:09,625
Wait.

461
00:54:10,292 --> 00:54:11,125
Plus.

462
00:54:23,125 --> 00:54:24,000
Attention!

463
00:54:28,458 --> 00:54:29,375
Countdown.

464
00:54:31,625 --> 00:54:32,458
Three...

465
00:54:33,583 --> 00:54:34,458
two...

466
00:54:35,792 --> 00:54:36,625
one!

467
00:54:49,708 --> 00:54:50,542
Contact.

468
00:54:50,625 --> 00:54:51,833
Get back, bitch!

469
00:54:51,917 --> 00:54:54,083
The target
is a militant behind the hostage.

470
00:54:57,917 --> 00:54:59,583
I operate near the hostage.

471
00:55:14,125 --> 00:55:15,250
Lie down, stupid!

472
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:19,292
Hit. Clean!

473
00:55:31,708 --> 00:55:34,000
Congratulations
on your first successful task.

474
00:55:42,542 --> 00:55:43,375
Clean!

475
00:56:27,833 --> 00:56:28,792
Come on.

476
00:56:50,708 --> 00:56:51,583
Hello guys.

477
00:56:55,875 --> 00:56:57,583
- Congratulations, boys!
- Hello.

478
00:56:57,667 --> 00:56:59,500
- Are Klym and Dunay here?
- I am not sure.

479
00:57:10,583 --> 00:57:11,417
Bad!

480
00:57:12,583 --> 00:57:13,625
Hello.

481
00:57:13,708 --> 00:57:14,708
Where are Klym and Dunay?

482
00:57:15,708 --> 00:57:16,750
On the mission.

483
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:07,333
Dunay...

484
01:02:11,417 --> 01:02:12,250
Where is Klym?

485
01:02:58,417 --> 01:02:59,375
What did you find out?

486
01:03:01,542 --> 01:03:05,875
The medic said that the bullet
in Klym's body opened like a flower,

487
01:03:07,667 --> 01:03:09,625
some fragments passed through,

488
01:03:11,208 --> 01:03:12,875
and others got stuck in the armor plate.

489
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:17,833
The guy had no chance.

490
01:03:20,083 --> 01:03:22,458
The vehicle breaks through,

491
01:03:23,375 --> 01:03:24,875
what can we say about the body...

492
01:03:26,208 --> 01:03:28,083
they want to demoralize us.

493
01:03:34,708 --> 01:03:35,875
So that's it.

494
01:03:37,583 --> 01:03:40,458
We need to quickly occupy
our trench at the zero line,

495
01:03:40,542 --> 01:03:42,875
where ours were evacuated.

496
01:03:44,208 --> 01:03:48,000
Take a detour along this forest strip,
the DRG enemy was noticed here.

497
01:03:48,083 --> 01:03:49,958
I'll give you an assault group to cover.

498
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:51,792
As you occupy the trench,

499
01:03:51,875 --> 01:03:54,917
keep an eye
on their positions here, nearby.

500
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,583
Just be careful,

501
01:03:57,792 --> 01:03:59,500
there may be a sniper somewhere.

502
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:01,750
If it's clean,

503
01:04:02,417 --> 01:04:03,833
I'll send a company to strengthen it.

504
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:06,583
Follow.

505
01:04:07,875 --> 01:04:08,708
Plus.

506
01:04:13,833 --> 01:04:16,875
Cossacks, five minutes left.

507
01:06:14,875 --> 01:06:15,708
Report...

508
01:06:17,375 --> 01:06:18,292
First clear.

509
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:20,083
Plus.

510
01:06:26,375 --> 01:06:27,875
Distance 120.

511
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:30,875
Plus.

512
01:06:50,083 --> 01:06:53,500
Cap, third post. I see a group of five.

513
01:06:53,583 --> 01:06:59,083
Russian uniform, confidently going
on the green to meet you, do you roger?

514
01:06:59,667 --> 01:07:00,500
Plus.

515
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:03,917
The goal will be in 25.

516
01:07:07,208 --> 01:07:08,042
Twenty...

517
01:07:12,208 --> 01:07:13,208
Fifteen...

518
01:07:17,125 --> 01:07:18,000
Ten,

519
01:07:18,625 --> 01:07:19,458
nine...

520
01:07:20,208 --> 01:07:21,042
Ivan?

521
01:07:22,042 --> 01:07:23,042
Six,

522
01:07:24,042 --> 01:07:24,875
five,

523
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,042
four,

524
01:07:28,167 --> 01:07:29,000
three,

525
01:07:30,042 --> 01:07:30,875
two,

526
01:07:31,917 --> 01:07:33,083
one.

527
01:07:33,167 --> 01:07:34,125
Fire!

528
01:07:48,375 --> 01:07:49,375
Good job.

529
01:07:53,917 --> 01:07:57,250
- We're done, finish it.
- Plus-plus.

530
01:08:12,375 --> 01:08:13,417
Who is Ivan?

531
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,917
My former student from Horlivka.

532
01:08:27,042 --> 01:08:28,375
He made his choice.

533
01:08:39,917 --> 01:08:40,833
As did I...

534
01:09:57,042 --> 01:09:58,667
Huh, yeah. Piece of shit.

535
01:10:02,417 --> 01:10:03,500
So what's up?

536
01:10:06,583 --> 01:10:08,208
Stretches checked.

537
01:10:09,042 --> 01:10:11,333
It will not be possible
to climb through quietly.

538
01:10:24,833 --> 01:10:25,875
Who is in the photo?

539
01:10:27,917 --> 01:10:28,750
Family.

540
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:31,458
Can I have a look?

541
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:37,917
My wife Svitlana

542
01:10:39,042 --> 01:10:41,458
and daughters, Vika and Myroslava.

543
01:10:43,875 --> 01:10:45,250
Do the kids know where you are now?

544
01:10:48,125 --> 01:10:48,958
No.

545
01:10:49,458 --> 01:10:50,958
They think that I'm on a business trip.

546
01:10:52,042 --> 01:10:55,542
My wife and I agreed that
if they know less, they will sleep better.

547
01:10:57,125 --> 01:11:00,167
That's why she's worried
about everyone there.

548
01:11:03,083 --> 01:11:04,250
Got it.

549
01:11:22,250 --> 01:11:23,208
Is this your amulet?

550
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:36,958
This is my...

551
01:11:38,708 --> 01:11:39,542
family.

552
01:11:59,208 --> 01:12:01,333
Their positions are here.

553
01:12:02,583 --> 01:12:04,417
Keep an eye on them.

554
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:05,333
Yes, I understand. Crystal.

555
01:12:16,583 --> 01:12:18,542
Yes, of course, Nikolai Ivanych,

556
01:12:19,083 --> 01:12:21,083
we will do everything, don't worry.

557
01:12:22,083 --> 01:12:23,458
On the other side, we need more.

558
01:12:28,125 --> 01:12:29,833
Five minutes. Come on, come on.

559
01:12:29,917 --> 01:12:31,208
Understood, I'm working.

560
01:12:32,375 --> 01:12:34,042
Are the weapons checked?

561
01:12:34,125 --> 01:12:35,208
Batteries, walkie-talkies,

562
01:12:35,292 --> 01:12:36,458
- first aid kits.
- We have it!

563
01:12:36,542 --> 01:12:37,667
Everything is there!

564
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:38,792
Take off the flag, fuck...

565
01:12:38,875 --> 01:12:43,708
- Exactly! Shoot, bro!
- Come on.

566
01:12:44,208 --> 01:12:46,667
Just cut the normal branches,
why are you dragging this shit.

567
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:53,083
Here they have two.

568
01:12:54,458 --> 01:12:56,000
Here is a machine gun and a sniper pair.

569
01:12:56,792 --> 01:12:59,250
- Will you cover-up?
- Yeah.

570
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:00,500
Do you need an assistant?

571
01:13:01,917 --> 01:13:02,875
I'll handle it.

572
01:13:03,958 --> 01:13:06,042
- Everything is ready.
- Let's get everyone inside.

573
01:13:06,125 --> 01:13:09,958
- Get inside!
- Start engine!

574
01:13:14,958 --> 01:13:15,958
- Start engine!
- Let's go!

575
01:14:51,417 --> 01:14:53,167
At 11 o'clock there is a car.

576
01:14:55,792 --> 01:14:56,750
I see.

577
01:15:01,375 --> 01:15:03,542
Two militants near the car.

578
01:15:04,792 --> 01:15:06,417
Continue observation.

579
01:15:42,625 --> 01:15:44,083
A fighter with a machine gun.

580
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,333
The code is green. I can work!

581
01:15:51,625 --> 01:15:52,917
I do not allow you to.

582
01:15:53,458 --> 01:15:55,000
Keep observing.

583
01:15:57,542 --> 01:15:58,958
A fighter with a machine gun.

584
01:15:59,708 --> 01:16:02,458
The code is green. I can work!

585
01:16:02,542 --> 01:16:04,458
Put on the fuse!

586
01:16:08,042 --> 01:16:10,792
A fighter with a machine gun!
The code is green! I'm shooting!

587
01:16:10,875 --> 01:16:12,792
Put on the safety. That is an order!

588
01:16:16,083 --> 01:16:17,375
Motherfucker!

589
01:16:40,542 --> 01:16:41,583
I have 200!

590
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,583
Sniper at 10 o'clock!

591
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:33,000
Sniper! On the tenth! Distance 2,000.

592
01:17:39,625 --> 01:17:40,833
The first minus.

593
01:17:43,083 --> 01:17:44,875
Second in the sector K4.

594
01:17:45,667 --> 01:17:46,875
Yes. We are working.

595
01:19:34,458 --> 01:19:36,000
I asked at the top...

596
01:19:41,667 --> 01:19:43,792
Secret services will look
for the killer of the Cap.

597
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,250
When there is information,

598
01:19:52,083 --> 01:19:53,667
I'll call you

599
01:19:54,833 --> 01:19:57,750
and you will deal with it.

600
01:20:03,208 --> 01:20:04,083
Do you understand?

601
01:20:18,625 --> 01:20:19,458
Dismissed.

602
01:20:41,542 --> 01:20:42,375
Captain...

603
01:21:02,833 --> 01:21:03,750
It's time for us.

604
01:22:16,875 --> 01:22:17,708
Yakut.

605
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:20,083
What do you have?

606
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:22,750
How long will I be lying here?

607
01:22:23,250 --> 01:22:25,333
I won't be able
to wash off this shit for a week.

608
01:22:28,792 --> 01:22:33,750
Be patient, Makar.
You will lie in my shit all my life.

609
01:22:35,625 --> 01:22:36,750
Fuck off.

610
01:22:58,917 --> 01:23:00,125
I waved everything.

611
01:23:39,833 --> 01:23:43,375
I will crawl to you.

612
01:24:02,167 --> 01:24:03,292
Makar, respond.

613
01:24:11,458 --> 01:24:15,292
Fuck. Where are you, have you fallen?

614
01:24:18,792 --> 01:24:20,083
You, bitch.

615
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:07,375
...The third-largest nuclear arsenal

616
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,708
in the world.

617
01:25:11,458 --> 01:25:14,458
And in 1994 a memorandum was signed

618
01:25:14,542 --> 01:25:17,625
between Ukraine, Russia,
Great Britain, and the USA...

619
01:25:17,708 --> 01:25:18,667
That's right.

620
01:25:18,750 --> 01:25:24,042
The memorandum on non-proliferation
guaranteed Ukraine's independence,

621
01:25:24,125 --> 01:25:26,875
sovereignty, and borders.

622
01:25:26,958 --> 01:25:31,333
We all know how Russia respects
the borders of other states...

623
01:25:31,417 --> 01:25:34,958
So the solution to this problem...

624
01:26:09,167 --> 01:26:13,708
BRIGADE COMMANDER

625
01:26:19,583 --> 01:26:20,583
Speaking.

626
01:26:20,667 --> 01:26:22,292
It lit up near Horlivka.

627
01:26:23,375 --> 01:26:25,083
He fired two of our scouts.

628
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:29,333
Was it in a wide range?

629
01:26:29,833 --> 01:26:30,667
Yes.

630
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:33,667
The first, two days ago.
The second, today.

631
01:26:33,750 --> 01:26:35,292
From one position?

632
01:26:35,375 --> 01:26:39,333
Not by the phone.
At the meeting. Get ready.

633
01:28:05,292 --> 01:28:06,167
ID?

634
01:28:10,667 --> 01:28:11,667
Drive.

635
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:12,667
Open it.

636
01:28:40,833 --> 01:28:43,958
Code name Elbrus, second-class.

637
01:28:44,583 --> 01:28:45,417
Congratulations.

638
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,792
- Beast, third-class, congratulations.
- Yeah.

639
01:28:54,042 --> 01:28:55,708
- Ray, third-class...
- Yes.

640
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:57,417
Congratulations.

641
01:28:57,917 --> 01:29:02,458
- Congratulations.
- I serve the Ukrainian people!

642
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,250
- How are you?
- Alive.

643
01:29:08,917 --> 01:29:10,000
Got you this.

644
01:29:11,917 --> 01:29:12,958
Thank you.

645
01:29:25,375 --> 01:29:26,500
- Hello!
- Hi!

646
01:29:30,208 --> 01:29:33,708
Cadets, at ease.
Grab your stuff and get in the car.

647
01:29:35,292 --> 01:29:36,125
Raven...

648
01:29:36,792 --> 01:29:37,625
Aye.

649
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:40,042
- Ready?
- Yes sir.

650
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:43,333
Follow me.

651
01:29:49,417 --> 01:29:50,417
Attention to all.

652
01:29:51,417 --> 01:29:53,292
Recently, intelligence provided us
with information...

653
01:29:54,708 --> 01:29:55,750
Show the slide.

654
01:29:58,542 --> 01:30:00,875
Russian sniper. Call sign "Sery".

655
01:30:00,958 --> 01:30:05,167
Works with 12.7 over long distances,
mostly 1.5 km.

656
01:30:06,333 --> 01:30:08,125
The bullets are wide-ranging.

657
01:30:09,167 --> 01:30:13,167
He has already killed five of our snipers
and three machine gunners.

658
01:30:14,833 --> 01:30:15,667
Show the site.

659
01:30:17,833 --> 01:30:20,542
He publishes his videos to demoralize us.

660
01:30:20,625 --> 01:30:24,292
In one of these videos, is our Cap.

661
01:30:24,375 --> 01:30:25,208
Shit!

662
01:30:26,125 --> 01:30:27,750
Yesterday our sniper

663
01:30:27,833 --> 01:30:29,917
was killed by the same bullet
between armor plates

664
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,833
near a chemical plant next to the river.

665
01:30:32,708 --> 01:30:35,167
Today was the same,
they hit in the same sector.

666
01:30:35,750 --> 01:30:36,875
They didn't change position?

667
01:30:37,833 --> 01:30:39,500
Cover it with mines.

668
01:30:40,083 --> 01:30:41,042
It won't work.

669
01:30:42,333 --> 01:30:44,417
Raven, you are a local,
explain to the guys.

670
01:30:45,833 --> 01:30:48,500
There is a chlorine storage under pressure
in the chemical plant.

671
01:30:49,917 --> 01:30:53,000
Well, fuck them.
PTUR him to the damn mother.

672
01:30:53,625 --> 01:30:56,583
- Explosion of cylinders is guaranteed.
- So what?

673
01:30:57,667 --> 01:30:59,375
Environmental disaster.

674
01:30:59,458 --> 01:31:00,292
Fuck.

675
01:31:02,208 --> 01:31:03,208
Is that clear to everyone?

676
01:31:05,375 --> 01:31:07,875
The plan is as follows. Map.

677
01:31:09,333 --> 01:31:11,292
There are a total of eight militants
on the territory.

678
01:31:11,917 --> 01:31:13,375
The sniper himself is probably
in a building

679
01:31:13,458 --> 01:31:15,000
where there are warehouses with chlorine.

680
01:31:15,083 --> 01:31:17,750
Plus two of his observers
are probably on the floors.

681
01:31:18,542 --> 01:31:19,375
So,

682
01:31:20,708 --> 01:31:24,417
the first pair of snipers
takes the first fighter.

683
01:31:25,208 --> 01:31:28,833
The second and third are these targets.

684
01:31:29,542 --> 01:31:31,875
The fourth and fifth are these two.

685
01:31:32,542 --> 01:31:33,625
And the final targets,

686
01:31:34,833 --> 01:31:35,750
two observers...

687
01:31:37,292 --> 01:31:38,250
and Sery.

688
01:31:38,750 --> 01:31:43,083
What's the point? Anyway, we cannot
shoot this chlorine under pressure.

689
01:31:43,833 --> 01:31:46,542
Our task is to clear the access only.

690
01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:49,667
And then what?

691
01:31:53,958 --> 01:31:55,667
Then Raven climbs up to him.

692
01:32:04,292 --> 01:32:05,125
Questions?

693
01:32:08,125 --> 01:32:09,042
Get ready.

694
01:32:55,667 --> 01:32:57,167
Raven, status.

695
01:33:01,625 --> 01:33:03,167
Three hours.

696
01:33:05,125 --> 01:33:05,958
Plus.

697
01:33:52,333 --> 01:33:53,250
First.

698
01:33:56,250 --> 01:33:57,292
In position.

699
01:33:59,833 --> 01:34:00,667
Second.

700
01:34:02,417 --> 01:34:03,375
In position.

701
01:35:04,167 --> 01:35:05,333
Raven, status...

702
01:35:12,958 --> 01:35:14,042
In position...

703
01:35:37,958 --> 01:35:39,208
Ah, pacifist...

704
01:35:40,208 --> 01:35:42,417
I should have shot you then...

705
01:35:55,125 --> 01:35:56,792
- Clear.
- Plus.

706
01:36:09,125 --> 01:36:11,333
Attention, readiness. Report...

707
01:36:11,417 --> 01:36:12,875
First ready.

708
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:19,667
Second ready.

709
01:36:20,833 --> 01:36:22,375
Third ready.

710
01:36:28,125 --> 01:36:29,208
Fifth ready...

711
01:36:34,625 --> 01:36:36,250
I see the target, the code is green.

712
01:36:38,583 --> 01:36:39,542
Countdown...

713
01:36:40,250 --> 01:36:41,083
Five,

714
01:36:41,167 --> 01:36:42,042
four,

715
01:36:42,125 --> 01:36:43,250
three,

716
01:36:43,333 --> 01:36:44,292
two,

717
01:36:44,375 --> 01:36:45,417
one.

718
01:37:00,750 --> 01:37:01,708
Whose fire?

719
01:37:02,625 --> 01:37:06,000
Fuck if I know.
The moron is watering somewhere.

720
01:37:20,375 --> 01:37:21,208
Report!

721
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:22,833
Clear.

722
01:37:23,833 --> 01:37:25,750
- Raven, work.
- Plus.

723
01:37:40,250 --> 01:37:41,083
First.

724
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:43,750
First.

725
01:37:46,333 --> 01:37:47,208
Second.

726
01:37:48,125 --> 01:37:49,125
In place.

727
01:37:49,958 --> 01:37:51,083
Report.

728
01:37:51,875 --> 01:37:53,000
Group, report...

729
01:37:54,042 --> 01:37:55,125
Group, report.

730
01:37:56,875 --> 01:37:58,083
Group, report.

731
01:38:08,750 --> 01:38:12,000
- There is no connection with the group.
- Second, report to me.

732
01:39:00,833 --> 01:39:01,667
Sery!

733
01:39:19,917 --> 01:39:21,792
- Hold your position!
- Yes.

734
01:39:48,375 --> 01:39:49,333
Fuck.

735
01:39:50,167 --> 01:39:52,167
- Second...
- In place.

736
01:39:56,125 --> 01:39:58,042
- Brown.
- Affirmative.

737
01:39:58,917 --> 01:40:02,708
- I have one 200.
- What happened?

738
01:40:02,792 --> 01:40:04,167
Sniper.

739
01:40:09,583 --> 01:40:12,167
Clear. What about the security group?

740
01:40:12,250 --> 01:40:13,542
No connection.

741
01:40:13,625 --> 01:40:17,000
Got it. Ten minutes. Hold your position.

742
01:40:19,167 --> 01:40:20,167
Yes.

743
01:40:24,833 --> 01:40:25,750
Second.

744
01:40:26,750 --> 01:40:27,708
In place.

745
01:40:27,792 --> 01:40:30,333
Return to your position
and guard the entrance.

746
01:40:30,417 --> 01:40:31,292
Yes.

747
01:42:14,458 --> 01:42:15,583
Fuck...

748
01:43:01,875 --> 01:43:03,167
Sery. Do you copy?

749
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:08,667
Sery, arrived with a group. Do you copy?

750
01:43:08,750 --> 01:43:11,458
You shitbags will answer us for Crimea.

751
01:43:50,125 --> 01:43:51,833

- Clean.

752
01:43:53,042 --> 01:43:54,792
Raven, the perimeter is clean.

755
01:46:58,625 --> 01:47:00,542
Guide your hand, Lord,

756
01:47:01,042 --> 01:47:03,625
to destroy all enemies...

757
01:47:05,083 --> 01:47:06,375
on this land.
