3 sessions only...

167
00:10:47,448 --> 00:10:48,779
to make an eval...

168
00:10:48,883 --> 00:10:50,908
and a recommendation to
your commanding officer.

169
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:51,985
You know
he wants to throw you...

170
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:53,144
out ofthe navy,
don't you?

171
00:10:53,254 --> 00:10:54,585
Now, you can sit here,
and you can not talk...

172
00:10:54,689 --> 00:10:55,781
to me ifyou want to...

173
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,517
but our sessions
don't begin...

174
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:58,990
until you begin
talking to me.

175
00:10:59,093 --> 00:11:00,617
I got nothing
to say.

176
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:02,252
Okay.

177
00:11:02,363 --> 00:11:03,489
Then we'll sit
until you do.

178
00:11:03,598 --> 00:11:04,656
I got a whole lot of
work to catch up on.

179
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:05,789
We can sit
here every day...

180
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,128
until the day I retire.
Doesn't matter to me.

181
00:11:07,235 --> 00:11:08,532
It doesn't matter
to me, either.

182
00:11:08,636 --> 00:11:09,796
- All righty.
- What about the brig?

183
00:11:09,904 --> 00:11:10,836
What about it?

184
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:13,463
Send me to the brig.

185
00:11:13,574 --> 00:11:14,905
There's the brig
right there.

186
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:16,533
Lockyourself up.

187
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:56,377
What doyou know?
Time's up.

188
00:11:56,484 --> 00:11:59,044
Seeyou next week,
1 400.

189
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:36,920
Want some chips?

190
00:12:37,024 --> 00:12:39,049
Hmph.

[Coughing]

193
00:13:23,571 --> 00:13:24,833
What?

194
00:13:24,939 --> 00:13:26,668
I didn't say anything.

195
00:13:26,774 --> 00:13:29,436
I thought
you said something.

196
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:31,704
Ahem. I was just
clearing my throat.

197
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:33,370
Okay.

198
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:37,416
[Clears Throat]

199
00:13:39,253 --> 00:13:40,481
Maybeyou're coming
down with something.

200
00:13:40,588 --> 00:13:44,217
Ahem. I'm all right.

[Wheezes]

202
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:48,523
It's just sort of...

203
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:50,529
Just what?

204
00:13:50,631 --> 00:13:52,030
Just...

205
00:13:52,133 --> 00:13:54,294
It's just a waste
oftime sitting here...

206
00:13:54,402 --> 00:13:56,063
week afterweek...

207
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,161
wasting time.

208
00:13:58,272 --> 00:13:59,500
I don't want you...

209
00:13:59,607 --> 00:14:00,699
to waste your time,
Antwone.

210
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,310
So, whatyou
want me to say?

211
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:14,719
It's not what
I wantyou to say.

212
00:14:14,822 --> 00:14:17,620
It's whatyou
want to tell me.

213
00:14:21,762 --> 00:14:24,526
Maybeyou can start
by asking me a question.

214
00:14:24,632 --> 00:14:25,792
I don't know.
Get things going.

215
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,800
I can do that.

216
00:14:27,902 --> 00:14:29,096
You said you come
from under a rock.

217
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:30,602
What did you mean
by that?

218
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:33,070
I don't know, I...

219
00:14:33,174 --> 00:14:35,335
It was the first thing
to come to my mind.

[Sighs]

221
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:38,404
What doyou think
it means?

222
00:14:38,512 --> 00:14:41,003
Well, it could mean...

223
00:14:41,115 --> 00:14:43,948
that, uh...

224
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:45,143
thatyou feel
under pressure...

225
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:47,117
that, uh...

226
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:48,848
uh, you feel a weight...

227
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:50,446
pressing down on you.

228
00:14:50,558 --> 00:14:52,287
That you're in the dark,
thatyou're alone.

229
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:53,758
You said you had
no parents.

230
00:14:53,861 --> 00:14:55,351
I had parents.

231
00:14:55,463 --> 00:14:57,624
Okay.

232
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:00,097
Ahem. Only 3 sessions,
right?

233
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:01,566
Only 3.

234
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,700
My father's name
was Edward.

235
00:15:10,111 --> 00:15:11,271
Soyou knew him?

236
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:13,710
No.

237
00:15:13,814 --> 00:15:15,247
I didn't even know
his last name.

238
00:15:15,349 --> 00:15:16,407
You know where he is?

239
00:15:16,517 --> 00:15:19,486
Yeah, I know
where he is.

240
00:15:19,587 --> 00:15:21,487
Joey--

241
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:26,919
He went to his
ex-girlfriend's house.

242
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:28,051
They got into
an argument.

243
00:15:28,162 --> 00:15:30,187
She killed my father.

244
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:31,764
Where was your mother
when this happened?

245
00:15:31,866 --> 00:15:33,959
Behind bars.

246
00:15:34,068 --> 00:15:35,695
I see.

247
00:15:35,803 --> 00:15:36,827
I was born in prison...

248
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:39,667
2 months after my
fatherwas murdered.

249
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:40,933
Whywas she confined,
your mother?

250
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,066
I don't know.

251
00:15:43,177 --> 00:15:44,576
All I know
is what I told you.

252
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:46,612
Soyou were turned over
to the state?

253
00:15:46,714 --> 00:15:50,343
Yeah. The state placed
me in this orphanage.

254
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:52,419
It was supposed to be until...

255
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,512
my mother got out
to claim me, but--

256
00:15:55,623 --> 00:15:57,682
She got out, but she
never claimed me.

257
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,554
Hmm. How long
wereyou there?

258
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,651
2 years.

259
00:16:01,762 --> 00:16:03,787
How does that make
you feel, Antwone?

260
00:16:05,866 --> 00:16:07,128
I don't know.

261
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:09,031
Come on, you must have
some feelings about it.

262
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:12,367
You know, you--
What did it feel like?

263
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:15,433
Rainy days.

264
00:16:15,543 --> 00:16:18,103
Rainy days? Okay.

265
00:16:18,212 --> 00:16:19,577
Why is that?

266
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:24,280
You know,
in Cleveland...

267
00:16:24,385 --> 00:16:26,182
it rains.
Not all the time...

268
00:16:26,287 --> 00:16:28,255
but, uh, to a kid...

269
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:31,518
who wants to go out
and play...

270
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,752
it seems like it
rains every day.

271
00:16:33,861 --> 00:16:35,795
But, uh...

272
00:16:35,896 --> 00:16:37,727
kids expect it
to rain sometimes...

273
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:40,265
but...for one kid...

274
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:42,858
it rained too much.

275
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:46,670
Hmm.

276
00:16:46,774 --> 00:16:48,332
Okay.

277
00:16:50,277 --> 00:16:51,539
You want me to
come back next week?

278
00:16:51,645 --> 00:16:54,273
Yes, I do.

279
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:55,678
You ever try to
find her, your mother?

280
00:16:55,783 --> 00:16:57,410
No, sir.

281
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:01,053
Okay. Next week.

282
00:17:07,595 --> 00:17:09,426

283
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:13,227
Uh, no more than usual.

284
00:17:13,334 --> 00:17:15,325
Hmm.

285
00:17:15,436 --> 00:17:17,165
The tomatoes are
from our garden.

286
00:17:17,271 --> 00:17:18,829
Yeah?

287
00:17:24,945 --> 00:17:28,073
Mmm. They're so much
better than lastyear.

288
00:17:28,182 --> 00:17:30,343
Heh heh.

289
00:17:34,088 --> 00:17:35,419
I mean, I'm no green
thumb or anything...

290
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:37,285
but...heh heh.

291
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:38,858
Who knows?
Maybe I'm learning.

292
00:17:50,871 --> 00:17:52,736

really are good.

Antwone, Voice-over:
When I was 2...

303
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,653
I was placed in the Tate
foster home.

304
00:18:15,763 --> 00:18:18,163
Reverend Tate, he was
a fire-breathing preacher.

305
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:20,062
He had his own
storefront church.

306
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:22,158
There was only
a few members.

307
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:24,829
There was Ms. Tate,
cousin Nadine...

308
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:27,805
my foster brothers Keith--

309
00:18:27,908 --> 00:18:29,808
Keith was halfwhite--

310
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:32,174
Dwight, and me.

311
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:35,271
& Good God, yeah &

312
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:37,509
It was church 3 times
on Sunday...

313
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:39,848
Bible study on Tuesday...

314
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:42,421
Y.P.W.W. meetings
on Thursday...

315
00:18:42,523 --> 00:18:44,684
choir rehearsal on Friday.

316
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:46,259
We found out ifwe caught
the Holy Ghost...

317
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,987
in front of Ms. Tate...

318
00:18:48,095 --> 00:18:50,620
she'd give us vanilla
wafers after church.

319
00:18:50,731 --> 00:18:52,699
So we'd catch it
every Sunday.

&Come on, church &

326
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:06,610
&Show me &

327
00:19:06,714 --> 00:19:08,944
Reverend Tate...

328
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:10,880
he didn't like
Dwight at all.

329
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:13,077
He said he had
too much pride.

330
00:19:13,187 --> 00:19:14,950
So he tried to
beat it out ofhim.

00:26:49,843 --> 00:26:51,310
Fancy?
Ain't no fancyword.

495
00:26:51,411 --> 00:26:52,503
Don't sassy me, boy.

496
00:26:52,612 --> 00:26:53,510
No one's
sassing you.

497
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:54,511
Don't sassy me!

498
00:26:54,614 --> 00:26:55,842
Ain't no one
sassing you!

499
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:57,780
Don'tyou--

500
00:26:57,884 --> 00:27:01,081
I ain't gonna letyou
beat me no more!

501
00:27:01,188 --> 00:27:03,122
No more!

502
00:27:04,424 --> 00:27:07,188
Lord Jesus.

503
00:27:07,294 --> 00:27:08,921
I wantyou out
of my house.

504
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:10,758
Hmm?

505
00:27:10,864 --> 00:27:12,923
And whoyou think
gonna takeyou in, huh?

506
00:27:13,033 --> 00:27:17,163
Retarded nigger,
don't nobodywantyou.

507
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:20,501
Your damn mammy
didn't even wantyou.

508
00:27:20,607 --> 00:27:23,974
Mrs. Tate:
Gimme my shoe. Hmpf!.

509
00:27:24,077 --> 00:27:24,975
Davenport:
Must've felt pretty good...

510
00:27:25,078 --> 00:27:26,875
when you took
that shoe from her.

511
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,948
Yeah, I felt
like I was gonna go...

512
00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:30,744
right upside
her head...

513
00:27:30,851 --> 00:27:32,682
but I just chilled.

514
00:27:32,786 --> 00:27:33,878
Why'd you chill?

515
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:36,547
I don't know.

516
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:39,716
Well, I'm glad you did.

517
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:41,817
How'd you feel?

518
00:27:41,928 --> 00:27:45,227
I felt like
I won a prize...

519
00:27:45,332 --> 00:27:46,356
but it scared me.

520
00:27:46,466 --> 00:27:48,058
Why?

521
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:49,465
It was the first time
I ever felt...

522
00:27:49,569 --> 00:27:51,628
more powerful than her.

523
00:27:51,738 --> 00:27:53,137
It was like a surprise.

524
00:27:55,408 --> 00:27:56,670
Whatever happened
to Jesse?

525
00:27:56,776 --> 00:27:58,209
We lost touch.
You know how it is.

526
00:27:58,311 --> 00:27:59,505
Davenport: Yeah.

527
00:27:59,613 --> 00:28:02,275
It might be helpful
to understand the mentality...

528
00:28:02,382 --> 00:28:05,112
of people
like the Tates.

529
00:28:05,218 --> 00:28:07,152
Here.

530
00:28:07,254 --> 00:28:10,087
It's called
The Slave Community.

531
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,885
Why I gotta understand
somebody beatin' on me?

532
00:28:11,992 --> 00:28:12,890
What you went through...

533
00:28:12,993 --> 00:28:15,621
was in part the result
ofthe treatment...

534
00:28:15,729 --> 00:28:18,323
that slaves received
from their masters...

535
00:28:18,431 --> 00:28:20,899
and then passed on
to their own children...

536
00:28:21,001 --> 00:28:22,366
generation to generation
to generation...

537
00:28:22,469 --> 00:28:25,165
right on down
to the Tates.

538
00:28:25,272 --> 00:28:27,240
Sir, that sounds
like an excuse.

539
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,534
I mean, I was a kid.

540
00:28:28,642 --> 00:28:30,473
I understand.

541
00:28:30,577 --> 00:28:31,635
You sound likeyou
takin' up for 'em.

542
00:28:31,745 --> 00:28:32,769
I'm not saying
what they did was right.

543
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:34,312
What they did
was wrong.

544
00:28:34,414 --> 00:28:36,439
We all have choices.
They made the wrong choices.

545
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:38,380
But this is not about them.
This is aboutyou.

546
00:28:38,485 --> 00:28:39,884
You were sent to me...

547
00:28:39,986 --> 00:28:41,283
becauseyou have
an anger problem.

548
00:28:41,388 --> 00:28:43,219
Well, you got the right
to be angry.

549
00:28:43,323 --> 00:28:46,656
Butyou also have to learn
to channel that anger...

550
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,159
to use it
constructively.

551
00:28:48,261 --> 00:28:49,159
Instead of gettin'
into fights...

552
00:28:49,262 --> 00:28:50,320
go to the gym.

553
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,193
Hit the bag,
lift the weights.

554
00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:56,395
You have to use that energy
to betteryourself.

555
00:28:56,503 --> 00:28:59,131
You sayyou're taking
Japanese classes, right?

556
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:00,206
Yeah.

557
00:29:00,307 --> 00:29:01,433
Okay, you're already
on the right track.

558
00:29:01,541 --> 00:29:05,705
Can we talk about
this next week?

559
00:29:05,812 --> 00:29:07,871
3 sessions, son.
Unfortunately...

560
00:29:07,981 --> 00:29:09,778
that's all I'm given
to make a recommendation...

561
00:29:09,883 --> 00:29:10,941
and I'm gonna recommend...

562
00:29:11,051 --> 00:29:13,383
thatyou be given
a second chance.

563
00:29:13,486 --> 00:29:14,783
That is whatyou want,
isn't it?

564
00:29:14,888 --> 00:29:17,356
To stay in the navy?

565
00:29:17,457 --> 00:29:19,049
Yes, sir.

566
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:21,684
Okay.
Okay, stay out oftrouble.

567
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:27,631
Cheryl: Antwone!

568
00:29:27,734 --> 00:29:29,133
Antwone!

569
00:29:31,972 --> 00:29:33,064
What's up?
How you doing?

570
00:29:33,173 --> 00:29:34,071
I'm cool.

571
00:29:34,174 --> 00:29:36,574
Oh.
You don't seem cool.

572
00:29:36,676 --> 00:29:39,611
I'm all right.

573
00:29:39,713 --> 00:29:40,611
What areyou
doin' in there?

574
00:29:40,714 --> 00:29:41,806
You still workin'
on that paper?

575
00:29:41,915 --> 00:29:43,177
No, I'm finished.

576
00:29:43,283 --> 00:29:44,682
I justwent through there
for a short cut.

577
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:46,979
Oh. Whereyou goin'?

578
00:29:47,087 --> 00:29:49,487
Nowhere.

579
00:29:51,691 --> 00:29:52,589
I--I gotta go.

580
00:29:52,692 --> 00:29:53,989
Cheryl, I'll talk
toyou later.

581

[Laughing Together]

582
00:30:03,403 --> 00:30:04,961
Whyyou always talkin'
about somebody's momma?

583
00:30:05,071 --> 00:30:07,062
Man, we ain't talkin'
about somebody's momma.

584
00:30:07,173 --> 00:30:09,801
We talkin'
aboutyour momma!

"Dis a ship!"

What's that book

594
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:30,796
Let me see
the cover.

595
00:30:30,897 --> 00:30:32,626

Whatcha readin'

597
00:30:34,234 --> 00:30:36,031
Because I want to.

598
00:30:36,136 --> 00:30:38,661
This ain't
no slave ship.

599
00:30:38,772 --> 00:30:40,637
And these ain't
no slavery days.

600
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,798
I can't tell.

601

656
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,486
Can't be floutin'
regulations.

657
00:32:41,594 --> 00:32:42,492
That's correct.

658
00:32:42,595 --> 00:32:46,087
Well, what do I do,
Commander?

659
00:32:46,199 --> 00:32:48,497
'Cause I don't know
what to do.

660
00:32:50,904 --> 00:32:52,804
I don't know
what to do.

661
00:33:15,428 --> 00:33:16,656
Tired?

662
00:33:19,699 --> 00:33:22,600
[Chuckles]

663
00:33:22,702 --> 00:33:24,294
How was your day?

664
00:33:27,373 --> 00:33:28,670
Long.

665
00:33:28,775 --> 00:33:30,868
Not complaining,
though.

666
00:33:30,977 --> 00:33:31,875
Well,
don't wait up.

667
00:33:31,978 --> 00:33:34,037
I got a lot
ofwork to do.

668
00:33:35,748 --> 00:33:37,147
I know.

669
00:33:39,986 --> 00:33:41,783
- Good night.
- Good night.

670
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,057
Well, it's nice
to finally be off...

671
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,525
restriction
for a change.

672
00:33:48,628 --> 00:33:50,789
Yeah, I'm gonna be
squared away from now on.

673
00:33:50,897 --> 00:33:51,829
Hey!

674
00:33:51,931 --> 00:33:53,398
Y'all need somethin'
from the exchange?

675
00:33:53,499 --> 00:33:54,932
Man, what's up with you
and the exchange?

676
00:33:55,034 --> 00:33:57,195
You spend more time there
than you do on restriction.

677
00:33:57,303 --> 00:33:58,827
I'm just tryin' to be
a good shipmate, man.

678
00:33:58,938 --> 00:33:59,836
I'm only kiddin'

679
00:33:59,939 --> 00:34:01,236
But bring me back

00:34:02,342 --> 00:34:03,331

682
00:34:03,443 --> 00:34:05,138

683
00:34:08,648 --> 00:34:10,343
What areyou

684
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:14,250
I was in the area
and sawyour ship.

685
00:34:14,354 --> 00:34:16,117
Soyou just saw
this big ol' ship...

686
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:17,484
moored alongside
the pier?

687
00:34:21,494 --> 00:34:22,825
I want to seeyou

688

next Wednesday,
after knockoff.

689
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,297
That is, ifyou want
to continue.

690
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:32,428
I think I need to check
my calender first...

691
00:34:32,538 --> 00:34:33,470
sir.

692
00:34:33,573 --> 00:34:35,507
Okay.

693

Well, you let me

694
00:34:37,577 --> 00:34:39,044
Yes, sir.

695
00:35:08,441 --> 00:35:10,500
Hey, Cheryl.

696
00:35:11,911 --> 00:35:13,105

698
00:35:14,213 --> 00:35:15,111
Nothing.

699
00:35:15,214 --> 00:35:16,238
You just gettin'

700
00:35:16,349 --> 00:35:17,407

701
00:35:17,517 --> 00:35:20,611

703
00:35:22,188 --> 00:35:24,452
Whywould I be mad?

704
00:35:28,261 --> 00:35:29,956
I'm sorry.

705
00:35:31,297 --> 00:35:33,822
That's cool.
[Chuckles]

706
00:35:33,933 --> 00:35:35,230
So, you finally

707
00:35:35,335 --> 00:35:36,927
Yeah.
[Chuckles]

708
00:35:37,036 --> 00:35:38,867
Yeah.

709
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:40,336
Soyou can

710
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,998
Yeah.

711
00:35:42,108 --> 00:35:43,973
So what about now?
I'm off.

712
00:35:44,077 --> 00:35:47,274
Nah, I gotta--
I gotta meet somebody.

713
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,404
Well, I promised
I'd meet somebody...

714
00:35:48,514 --> 00:35:51,142
in a few minutes,
so...you know.

715
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:53,184
What's her name?

716
00:35:53,286 --> 00:35:55,686
[Chuckles]
Look, it ain't like that.

717
00:35:55,788 --> 00:35:57,187
It ain't like that.

718
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:58,814
What about tomorrow?

719
00:35:58,925 --> 00:36:03,123
Um, what about the day
after tomorrow?

720
00:36:03,229 --> 00:36:05,163
Say, Wednesday,
after knockoff?

721
00:36:05,264 --> 00:36:07,129
That'd be better.

722
00:36:07,233 --> 00:36:08,825
Okay. Um...

723
00:36:08,935 --> 00:36:10,732

725
00:36:12,405 --> 00:36:15,306
Okay. All right.

726
00:36:15,408 --> 00:36:16,807
I'll meet you
at 1 700.

727
00:36:16,909 --> 00:36:18,240
All right.
Yeah.

728
00:36:18,344 --> 00:36:19,834
It's a date.

729
00:36:26,886 --> 00:36:27,750
Antwone:
Are we done?

730
00:36:27,854 --> 00:36:28,786
Davenport:
Yes, we are.

731
00:36:28,888 --> 00:36:30,048
Can I askyou
a question?

732
00:36:30,156 --> 00:36:31,180
Sure.

733
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:35,056
Um...
do you think it's--

734
00:36:35,161 --> 00:36:36,389
Do you think
it's possible...

735
00:36:36,496 --> 00:36:38,691
for somebody that had
problems all their life...

736
00:36:38,798 --> 00:36:41,426
you know,
not to stay that way?

737
00:36:41,534 --> 00:36:42,967
You know,
you think it's possible...

738
00:36:43,069 --> 00:36:44,093
they can change?

739
00:36:44,203 --> 00:36:45,670
Absolutely.
Why do you ask?

740
00:36:45,772 --> 00:36:46,932
No reason.

741
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,199
Do you want
something to drink?

742
00:36:48,307 --> 00:36:51,276
- No, I'm good, sir.
- Okay.

743
00:36:51,377 --> 00:36:54,744
Uh, you know, you--

744
00:36:54,847 --> 00:36:57,111
You know, when you
kinda meet somebody...

745
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,843
you know, ifyou
have problems...

746
00:36:58,951 --> 00:36:59,849
it wouldn't--

747
00:36:59,952 --> 00:37:02,614
Who is she?
What's her name?

748
00:37:02,722 --> 00:37:03,620
What's her name?

749
00:37:03,723 --> 00:37:05,714
Cheryl.

750
00:37:05,825 --> 00:37:07,053
She works
at the exchange.

751
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,821
That's a good thing.
Keep it navy.

752
00:37:08,928 --> 00:37:10,293
[Chuckles]
Right?

753
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:11,328
So?

754
00:37:11,431 --> 00:37:15,561
Um... so, um...

755
00:37:15,668 --> 00:37:17,465
Haveyou spoken
to heryet?

756
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:19,538
Yeah, I spoke to her,
but, um...

757
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:22,574
I get caught up--
tongue-tied.

758
00:37:22,675 --> 00:37:24,575
Everybody's
awkward at first.

759
00:37:24,677 --> 00:37:25,575
Okay.

760
00:37:25,678 --> 00:37:26,770
No, not like me.

761
00:37:26,879 --> 00:37:28,312
No, everybody is,
Antwone. Trust me.

762
00:37:28,414 --> 00:37:29,312
Even you?

763
00:37:29,415 --> 00:37:30,382
Even me. Everybody.

764
00:37:30,483 --> 00:37:33,452
So...

765
00:37:33,553 --> 00:37:35,885
Well, we're
going out tonight.

766
00:37:35,988 --> 00:37:37,216
Good.

767
00:37:37,323 --> 00:37:39,052
We supposed to go out
a couple of days ago...

768
00:37:39,158 --> 00:37:40,955
but, uh, you know...

769
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,960
I just wanted
to clear my head.

770
00:37:43,062 --> 00:37:44,791
Take some time.

771
00:37:44,897 --> 00:37:46,888
You know,
talk toyou first.

772
00:37:46,999 --> 00:37:49,729
Okay.
Yeah.

773
00:37:49,836 --> 00:37:50,860
So, what
should I do?

774
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:53,996
[Laughs]
Well, she's a nice girl?

775
00:37:54,106 --> 00:37:55,971
Yeah, obviously
you like her.

776
00:37:56,075 --> 00:37:57,064
Mm-hmm.

777
00:37:57,176 --> 00:37:58,575
Okay, I thinkyou should
just go outwith her.

778
00:37:58,678 --> 00:38:01,841
I mean...

779
00:38:01,948 --> 00:38:04,576
I tell you what.
You know, sometimes it helps...

780
00:38:04,684 --> 00:38:07,619
just to take the anxiety
out ofa future meeting...

781
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,744
to role play.

782
00:38:08,855 --> 00:38:09,879
What's that?

783
00:38:09,989 --> 00:38:12,321
Like, you playyourself
and I'll play Cheryl...

784
00:38:12,425 --> 00:38:13,449
and I'll askyou
some questions...

785
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:15,026
and we'll have
a conversation...

786
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:17,186
and you'll see that
you'll have a good time, okay?

787
00:38:17,296 --> 00:38:18,194
Yeah,
you play Cheryl.

788
00:38:18,297 --> 00:38:20,697
Okay, now.
That's right.

789
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,325
That's right.
I'm man enough to play Cheryl.

790
00:38:23,436 --> 00:38:27,770
Okay.
Uh, you go first.

791
00:38:27,874 --> 00:38:28,772

I'll go first.

793
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:32,937

Good, good.

797
00:38:38,751 --> 00:38:40,184
So, where we gonna go?

798
00:38:41,854 --> 00:38:44,015

799
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:47,452

800
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,584
Uh...

[Antwone Sighs]

802
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:51,954
I'm hungry. You?

803
00:38:52,064 --> 00:38:52,962
I could eat.

804
00:38:53,065 --> 00:38:54,828
See? That's good.
You got it.

805
00:38:54,934 --> 00:38:56,128
You think so?
Absolutely.

806
00:38:56,235 --> 00:38:57,634
I don't thinkyou have

00:38:57,737 --> 00:38:59,068
I'm gonna giveyou

808
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:00,695

Okay.
You never know, son.

814
00:39:13,085 --> 00:39:14,848
These things,
sometimes they can escalate.

815
00:39:14,954 --> 00:39:16,888
Escalate into what?

816
00:39:16,989 --> 00:39:20,254
Mywife and I went out.
It escalated into marriage.

817
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:22,452
No, we not escalatin'
into marriage.

818
00:39:22,562 --> 00:39:24,029
All right, well good.
You get outta here.

01:49:20,251 --> 01:49:22,048
- Aww.
- Aww.

2116
01:50:05,396 --> 01:50:07,296
Welcome.

2117
01:50:17,308 --> 01:50:18,673
All right.

2118
01:50:18,776 --> 01:50:19,868
Come on,
let's eat!

2119
01:50:24,482 --> 01:50:29,010
You want
some pancakes? Ooh.

2120
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:30,018
Sure, sure.

2121
01:50:33,824 --> 01:50:34,882
Here we go.

2122
01:50:34,992 --> 01:50:36,152
How about
some sausages?

2123
01:51:03,054 --> 01:51:04,612
I'm not a virgin
anymore.

2124
01:51:09,660 --> 01:51:11,560
I'm glad to hear that.

2125
01:51:19,470 --> 01:51:20,368
Howyou doin', son?

2126
01:51:20,471 --> 01:51:21,369
I'm great, sir.

2127
01:51:21,472 --> 01:51:22,370
All right. Good.
Good, good.

2128
01:51:22,473 --> 01:51:23,872
Very good
to seeyou.

2129
01:51:23,974 --> 01:51:25,601
So?

2130
01:51:25,710 --> 01:51:27,007
I tookyour advice.

2131
01:51:27,111 --> 01:51:30,842
I found my family
and I found my mother.

2132
01:51:30,948 --> 01:51:31,846
Good.

2133
01:51:31,949 --> 01:51:33,280
Yeah.

2134
01:51:33,384 --> 01:51:34,612
So?

2135
01:51:34,719 --> 01:51:36,448
Well, in my heart
I forgive her...

2136
01:51:36,554 --> 01:51:39,717
but ifl never
saw her again...

2137
01:51:39,824 --> 01:51:41,382
I understand.

2138
01:51:41,492 --> 01:51:44,120
It's funny to feel that way
aboutyour mother...

2139
01:51:44,228 --> 01:51:46,128
but I did it...

2140
01:51:46,230 --> 01:51:48,221
and I owe it toyou to tell you
thatyou were right.

2141
01:51:48,332 --> 01:51:49,526
You owe it to me?

2142
01:51:49,633 --> 01:51:50,622
Yes, sir.

2143
01:51:50,735 --> 01:51:51,997
I needed to find her.

2144
01:51:52,103 --> 01:51:54,901
Yeah. Well...

2145
01:51:55,005 --> 01:51:57,235
ifl was right, it was
for all the wrong reasons.

2146
01:51:57,341 --> 01:51:59,138
Sir?

2147
01:51:59,243 --> 01:52:01,734
This stays between
you and me, okay?

2148
01:52:01,846 --> 01:52:04,076
Yes, sir.

2149
01:52:04,181 --> 01:52:06,240
Mywife and I, we were gonna
have a bunch ofkids...

2150
01:52:06,350 --> 01:52:08,318
when we found out
we couldn't have any.

2151
01:52:08,419 --> 01:52:10,979
And it rocked her
to the core.

2152
01:52:11,088 --> 01:52:12,646
I knew what to do for her,
though.

2153
01:52:12,757 --> 01:52:15,123
She needed help, treatment.

2154
01:52:15,226 --> 01:52:16,591
I made sure she had it.

2155
01:52:16,694 --> 01:52:19,390
The best psychiatrist,
the one that trained me.

2156
01:52:19,497 --> 01:52:22,295
But I--the well one,
the strong one--

2157
01:52:22,399 --> 01:52:28,304
At the same time I went about
the business of shutting down.

2158
01:52:28,405 --> 01:52:33,138
Very subtle, very quiet.
It was my little secret.

2159
01:52:33,244 --> 01:52:37,840
Until one day, a young man came
into my office and into my life...

2160
01:52:37,948 --> 01:52:41,714
and he blew up that little
secret, right in my face.

2161
01:52:41,819 --> 01:52:46,620
And he put me to shame in a way
I never thought possible.

2162
01:52:48,659 --> 01:52:52,789
Because ofyou, Antwone,
I'm a better doctor...

2163
01:52:52,897 --> 01:52:56,389
and I'm learning
to be a better husband.

2164
01:52:58,402 --> 01:53:02,236
You don't owe me anything.
I oweyou.

2165
01:53:02,339 --> 01:53:03,397
You're the champ, son.

2166
01:53:03,507 --> 01:53:05,668
You've beaten everybody
who was beating you.

2167
01:53:07,845 --> 01:53:09,176
I saluteyou.

2168
01:53:16,020 --> 01:53:17,009
You hungry, sailor?

2169
01:53:17,121 --> 01:53:18,952
I could eat, sir.

2170
01:53:21,859 --> 01:53:23,053
Let's go.
