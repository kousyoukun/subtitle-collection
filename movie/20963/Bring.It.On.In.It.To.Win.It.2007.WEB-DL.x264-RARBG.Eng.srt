1
00:00:34,366 --> 00:00:41,596
East Coast!West Coast!

2
00:00:41,672 --> 00:00:43,002
East Coast!

3
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:47,009
How does if feel to be the
centerfold for losers?

4
00:00:47,945 --> 00:00:50,205
Not this year. Sharks all the way.

5
00:00:50,282 --> 00:00:51,722
Yeah.

6
00:00:51,784 --> 00:00:54,054
Just because you shanks go all
the way...

7
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:55,639
What?

8
00:00:56,522 --> 00:00:58,652
...doesn't mean your team will.

9
00:01:03,227 --> 00:01:04,347
Boys.

10
00:01:07,266 --> 00:01:09,496
One, two, three, four.

11
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:11,587
"J" to the "E" to the "T"
to the "S"

12
00:01:11,669 --> 00:01:13,969
jets kick ass from east to west

13
00:01:14,038 --> 00:01:18,568
All you do is shake your butts
Cheer 101 for stupid sluts

14
00:01:19,777 --> 00:01:22,297
We're the West Coast Sharks
And we got bite

15
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:24,751
We got what it takes to win this fight

16
00:01:24,816 --> 00:01:27,006
jets, you stiff,you dull, you old

17
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:29,246
Your moves and motions leave us cold

18
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:34,619
Carson, captain of their team A
loser even in her dreams

19
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:41,301
You said it all,except one hitch

20
00:01:41,432 --> 00:01:43,702
She's a stuck-up, nasty,stupid
little witch

21
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:46,069
You girls think that you're ahead

22
00:01:46,205 --> 00:01:48,495
Our mascot's moves will knock you dead!

23
00:02:26,945 --> 00:02:28,495
I am so psyched!

24
00:02:29,413 --> 00:02:32,353
No, really. This time it wasn't
a nightmare.

25
00:02:32,951 --> 00:02:34,151
Busted.

26
00:03:08,085 --> 00:03:11,205
Damn! We're gonna have some fun.

27
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:14,451
Fun? We're not here to have fun,
Ruben. We're here to win.

28
00:03:14,526 --> 00:03:17,356
Do you think East Coast is here
to have fun?Hell, no! So, no fun.

29
00:03:17,429 --> 00:03:20,399
Okay. I won't use the "F"
word anymore.

30
00:03:20,465 --> 00:03:23,425
Look, this year we're taking the
title and going on the world tour.

31
00:03:23,502 --> 00:03:24,762
Hell to the yeah!

32
00:03:24,835 --> 00:03:27,125
Let's bust some East Coast attitude!

33
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:30,066
Reality check. The Jets have beat
us three years in a row.

34
00:03:30,141 --> 00:03:31,701
What's your problem,doom cookie?

35
00:03:31,776 --> 00:03:35,206
No problem. Let the disemboweling begin!

36
00:03:37,982 --> 00:03:39,422
Dibs on their entrails!

37
00:03:41,986 --> 00:03:45,716
Cheer TV is live at the Hard Rock
Hotel at Universal Orlando.

38
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,420
And I'm here with Pepper Driscoll
and Vance Voorhees,

39
00:03:48,493 --> 00:03:50,963
owners of the two rival cheer camps.

40
00:03:51,029 --> 00:03:52,929
Pepper, can you tell us a little bit about

41
00:03:52,997 --> 00:03:54,857
the All Star Cheer Camp Championships?

42
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:57,994
I'd love to. Well, this year is
extra special,

43
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,900
because the winning squad will
represent our great nation

44
00:04:00,972 --> 00:04:02,842
on a Cheer Exhibition World Tour.

45
00:04:02,907 --> 00:04:04,097
That's right.

46
00:04:04,176 --> 00:04:07,196
And my teams will come in at
least first and second place again.

47
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:10,579
Pepper's camp has both champion squads

48
00:04:10,649 --> 00:04:13,619
that epitomize the clash in
American cheer styles.

49
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:16,223
In fact, last year,one of her squads,

50
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:18,978
the East Coast jets,with their
traditional cheer moves

51
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:21,558
narrowly defeated the West Coast Sharks,

52
00:04:21,627 --> 00:04:23,557
another one of Pepper's squads shown here

53
00:04:23,629 --> 00:04:25,489
with their new wave dance styling

54
00:04:25,564 --> 00:04:28,094
inspired by music video choreography.

55
00:04:28,499 --> 00:04:30,659
In the cheer world,the controversy
is brewing over

56
00:04:30,736 --> 00:04:35,036
what exactly defines cheerleading,
precision or flavor.

57
00:04:35,107 --> 00:04:36,657
Speaking of controversy,Vance,

58
00:04:36,741 --> 00:04:38,731
is the bad blood between your
Camp Victory

59
00:04:38,809 --> 00:04:40,779
and Pepper's Camp Spirit Thunder

60
00:04:40,846 --> 00:04:42,246
related to your divorce?

61
00:04:43,382 --> 00:04:45,042
Of course not. We're both professionals,

62
00:04:45,116 --> 00:04:46,706
and we handle our craft seriously.

63
00:04:46,785 --> 00:04:48,075
Which is why I can say that, this year,

64
00:04:48,153 --> 00:04:50,213
a Camp Victory team will vanquish
all comers.

65
00:04:50,288 --> 00:04:52,718
By vanquish he means third again.

66
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:55,731
No, this year Camp Victory has
a secret weapon.

67
00:04:55,794 --> 00:04:57,764
Bulltwinkle, you do not.

68
00:04:57,829 --> 00:05:00,159
We do, and I guess you're gonna
have to wait and see.

69
00:05:00,231 --> 00:05:03,761
Well, we'll all see in this
Saturday's World Cheer Exhibition

70
00:05:03,835 --> 00:05:05,795
right here on Cheer TV.

71
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:29,559
All right, after everybody unpacks,

72
00:05:29,628 --> 00:05:30,988
we need to practice our home routine.

73
00:05:31,063 --> 00:05:32,263
We just got here.

74
00:05:32,331 --> 00:05:33,801
Yeah, and if we want to leave
here winners,

75
00:05:33,864 --> 00:05:35,964
it's going to take practice,
practice and more practice.

76
00:05:36,034 --> 00:05:37,164
And after that...

77
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:38,426
Oh, my God. Carson.

78
00:05:38,502 --> 00:05:40,702
I'm, like, so glad you came back this year.

79
00:05:40,771 --> 00:05:42,901
Hey, Brooke,of course we came back.

80
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:46,595
After losing to us three years
in a row,it's, like, so brave.

81
00:05:46,678 --> 00:05:48,798
Yo! Can we burn this Least Coast trash?

82
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:51,249
You know what?They're not even
worth it, Aeysha.

83
00:05:51,316 --> 00:05:53,476
Give it up, Brooke. We're not
gonna play like that.

84
00:05:53,552 --> 00:05:55,822
Oh, you mean like champions?

85
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,820
Yeah. Not really your thing, huh?

86
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,820
Practice in 10 minutes!

87
00:06:00,891 --> 00:06:01,881
Ta-ta.

88
00:06:01,992 --> 00:06:05,292
We're from the West Coast The
mighty, mighty West Coast

89
00:06:05,363 --> 00:06:08,703
We ain't got no fear We're the
best,it's our year!

90
00:06:08,767 --> 00:06:11,897
W- E-S-T,West Coast can't be beat!

91
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:14,800
I think it's time for a little
guerilla warfare.

92
00:06:14,873 --> 00:06:17,643
Brooke, where are we gonna find gorillas?

93
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,010
Just follow my lead.

94
00:06:20,078 --> 00:06:22,478
All right, you guys,spread out.
Give it flavor.

95
00:06:22,547 --> 00:06:24,407
Five, six, seven, eight.

96
00:06:24,483 --> 00:06:28,153
One, two, four,five and six,
seven and eight.

97
00:06:28,219 --> 00:06:31,849
One, two, and four,five and six,
seven and eight.

98
00:06:31,922 --> 00:06:34,252
One and two... Ignore them!

99
00:06:34,325 --> 00:06:36,385
Six, seven, eight. Hey, girls.

100
00:06:36,495 --> 00:06:37,585
Oh, hell, no.

101
00:06:37,661 --> 00:06:38,991
Oh, shit.

102
00:06:39,063 --> 00:06:40,363
She's gonna go throw down.

103
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,660
Yo, Paris Hilton.

104
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:44,733
If you and this little purse dog of yours

105
00:06:44,802 --> 00:06:47,172
ever pull that skanky East Coast mess again,

106
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:48,899
I will slice you like government cheese!

107
00:06:48,973 --> 00:06:50,573
Aeysha, give it a rest. Give it a rest.

108
00:06:50,641 --> 00:06:52,171
I swear to you I will...

109
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:54,014
I didn't know the government made cheese.

110
00:06:54,078 --> 00:06:55,808
She better watch her back.

111
00:06:57,149 --> 00:06:58,339
What?

112
00:06:58,417 --> 00:06:59,847
You go, girl.

113
00:07:00,684 --> 00:07:02,784
You know what?I need to rework
that transition, anyway,

114
00:07:02,854 --> 00:07:05,554
so free time until opening ceremonies.

115
00:07:36,388 --> 00:07:37,478
Whoa.

116
00:07:39,691 --> 00:07:41,161
Hey, are you okay?

117
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:42,517
I'm fine.

118
00:07:42,594 --> 00:07:44,694
You kind of got skid marks.

119
00:07:45,297 --> 00:07:48,457
Good. Now the police can track
down the stroller.

120
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,730
Hey, why do I feel like I've
met you before?

121
00:07:50,802 --> 00:07:52,742
I don't know. Maybe in a prior life.

122
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:56,565
Well, I was thinking this one,
but now that sounds whack.

123
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,275
So, where are you from?

124
00:07:58,342 --> 00:08:01,282
California. A place called Eden Hills.
You?

125
00:08:01,345 --> 00:08:02,965
Nowhere and everywhere.

126
00:08:03,114 --> 00:08:04,784
You know,I'm an army brat.

127
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,480
I guess I'm just a regular brat.

128
00:08:06,618 --> 00:08:08,248
I've never been out of the country.

129
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,950
We just moved back from London.

130
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:12,321
Really?We're going there soon.

131
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,360
Oh, you're gonna love England.

132
00:08:14,426 --> 00:08:16,186
You know me so well. Oh, no doubt.

133
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,730
Because, you know,in our prior life,

134
00:08:17,796 --> 00:08:19,416
when we were guards at Buckingham Palace,

135
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:21,828
you were that hottie wearing
that bearskin hat.

136
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,800
Of course, all the guards were
trying to hook up with you.

137
00:08:23,869 --> 00:08:25,359
Oh, right, let me guess.

138
00:08:25,436 --> 00:08:26,896
You defended my honor.

139
00:08:26,972 --> 00:08:29,502
No, I was trying to get at you, too.

140
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,336
Hey, you ever done the Double-Dragon?

141
00:08:31,408 --> 00:08:32,838
What?

142
00:08:37,615 --> 00:08:39,905
Right. I got to go.

143
00:08:39,985 --> 00:08:41,475
Hey, hold up, skids.

144
00:08:41,552 --> 00:08:43,352
What if I want to see you again?

145
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:48,675
Number?

146
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,860
916-555-0198.

147
00:08:58,403 --> 00:09:00,933
Cool. Now, I got your number, skids.

148
00:09:01,006 --> 00:09:02,336
It's Carson.

149
00:09:02,407 --> 00:09:03,697
It's Penn.

150
00:09:10,214 --> 00:09:12,214
If you need help wiping that off...

151
00:09:14,652 --> 00:09:17,252
Just so you know,I'm not mad anymore.

152
00:09:17,322 --> 00:09:19,692
I MySpaced it all out of my system.

153
00:09:19,757 --> 00:09:23,017
Now, hurry up,or we're gonna
be late for the opening ceremony.

154
00:09:23,094 --> 00:09:25,894
Why him? Why now?

155
00:09:25,963 --> 00:09:27,233
Why who?

156
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:29,429
Aeysha,I met this guy.

157
00:09:29,501 --> 00:09:32,161
What? I wasn't even sure you
remember what guys were.

158
00:09:32,237 --> 00:09:33,827
His name is Penn and he's so...

159
00:09:33,905 --> 00:09:35,425
Carson, breathe.

160
00:09:35,906 --> 00:09:37,596
He's awesome and smart,but in a good way.

161
00:09:37,676 --> 00:09:39,106
And he's hot,caliente hot.

162
00:09:39,177 --> 00:09:41,697
Aeysha, I want to lick his abs.

163
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,910
But you didn't, right?

164
00:09:42,981 --> 00:09:44,011
No!

165
00:09:44,449 --> 00:09:47,779
I need to stay focused,that
means no cute boys.

166
00:09:48,353 --> 00:09:50,913
Right now,beating the Jets is
my top priority.

167
00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:52,049
And you're doing the right thing.

168
00:09:52,122 --> 00:09:53,152
I know.

169
00:09:53,223 --> 00:09:54,923
So, can I have him?

170
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:02,296
Ooh, Penn looks hot.

171
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,487
Just don't.

172
00:10:07,871 --> 00:10:09,031
What do you mean?

173
00:10:09,107 --> 00:10:10,727
I like your hair that way, Chelsea.

174
00:10:10,808 --> 00:10:11,938
Oh, it's this new gel.

175
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,530
My hair always looks better when
there's something sticky in it.

176
00:10:16,348 --> 00:10:18,208
All right. Who is she?

177
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:19,870
What?

178
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:21,581
The girl who's making you stupid.

179
00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:23,579
All right. Check it out. I met her today

180
00:10:23,655 --> 00:10:25,375
when I was running. Her name's...

181
00:10:25,456 --> 00:10:26,476
Carson!Carson!

182
00:10:26,557 --> 00:10:28,187
Right. Wrong.

183
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:29,389
She's a Shark.

184
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,550
She's the frigging captain of the Sharks.

185
00:10:30,628 --> 00:10:31,928
And what did she say?What did she want?

186
00:10:31,997 --> 00:10:33,227
Did she ask about our routines?

187
00:10:33,298 --> 00:10:34,528
Yeah, right.

188
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,360
Cheering was the last thing
we talked about.

189
00:10:36,434 --> 00:10:38,334
Penn, she's like your sworn emeny.

190
00:10:38,403 --> 00:10:39,893
I swear it.

191
00:10:40,438 --> 00:10:42,628
Trust me. She's not my enemy.

192
00:10:50,248 --> 00:10:52,308
Penn, you need to know.

193
00:10:52,384 --> 00:10:54,784
Carson's a two-faced,back-biting,
man-eating Shark!

194
00:10:54,853 --> 00:10:56,843
Yeah. And guys hate biters.

195
00:10:56,921 --> 00:10:58,181
Why are you guys busting on me?

196
00:10:58,255 --> 00:10:59,715
Because you don't get it.

197
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:02,161
Yeah. I think I do.

198
00:11:04,996 --> 00:11:07,116
Don't flatter yourself, Penn.

199
00:11:07,197 --> 00:11:09,597
This is about our team,about winning.

200
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:10,968
So now what, Captain?

201
00:11:11,036 --> 00:11:12,826
Are you gonna forbid me from
seeing Carson?

202
00:11:12,903 --> 00:11:14,003
I would never do that.

203
00:11:14,072 --> 00:11:16,372
Good, 'cause it wouldn't work.

204
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,010
He can't date a Shark!

205
00:11:24,082 --> 00:11:27,682
Duh, Chelsea. Watch and learn.

206
00:11:34,858 --> 00:11:38,058
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

207
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:39,289
Hi, everybody.

208
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,485
Welcome to Camp Spirit Thunder.

209
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:47,699
This year,we're so proud to welcome

210
00:11:47,772 --> 00:11:50,142
a new member to our family, okay.

211
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,699
I heard she's really tough.

212
00:11:51,776 --> 00:11:56,106
Give a big Spirit welcome to
our new choreographer,Chicago.

213
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,050
Come on up here, girl.

214
00:12:03,254 --> 00:12:05,314
All right, all eyes on me.

215
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,820
Now, I want you all to remember
this gorgeous face,

216
00:12:07,892 --> 00:12:10,262
'cause it will haunt you in your sleep.

217
00:12:10,328 --> 00:12:11,988
Now, I believe in hard work.

218
00:12:12,062 --> 00:12:13,662
Winning knows no pain.

219
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:17,002
So, when I say jump,I wanna hear,
"How high?"

220
00:12:17,068 --> 00:12:18,228
Now jump.

221
00:12:18,302 --> 00:12:19,432
How high?

222
00:12:19,503 --> 00:12:20,993
That's what I'm talking about.

223
00:12:21,072 --> 00:12:22,512
Don't hate the player, baby.

224
00:12:22,906 --> 00:12:26,636
Okay, seriously,Cheerzilla is
a little scary.

225
00:12:27,045 --> 00:12:29,535
What? I love her.

226
00:12:29,613 --> 00:12:32,853
She's the kind of black woman
gay men emulate. She's amazing.

227
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:38,857
Welcome your cheer-tastic 2008
Spirit Thunder instructors!

228
00:12:43,795 --> 00:12:45,485
Come on, guys.

229
00:12:51,235 --> 00:12:52,635
That was really great.

230
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,260
Yeah! Aren't they terrific?

231
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:28,074
Aren't they wonderful?

232
00:13:28,873 --> 00:13:30,363
Yeah!

233
00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:32,439
All right.

234
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:38,280
And now, as you know,we have a
very special tradition here

235
00:13:38,349 --> 00:13:41,279
at Camp Spirit Thunder.

236
00:13:44,354 --> 00:13:46,854
This spirit stick was given to me

237
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:49,545
by the father of cheerleading himself,

238
00:13:49,626 --> 00:13:51,356
Herkie Herkimer.

239
00:13:51,429 --> 00:13:55,419
It embodies the heart and the
soul of cheerleading,

240
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,900
and it brings the luck of the
cheer spirits.

241
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:02,410
So, each team will be able to experience

242
00:14:02,472 --> 00:14:05,872
its powerful aura for one night.

243
00:14:09,214 --> 00:14:10,244
That's right.

244
00:14:10,315 --> 00:14:15,305
And last year's winners of the
Championships will have the honors first,

245
00:14:15,386 --> 00:14:17,176
the East Coast jets.

246
00:14:22,226 --> 00:14:23,656
Go get it. What?

247
00:14:23,728 --> 00:14:25,588
Come on. You do it. Go. What?

248
00:14:25,663 --> 00:14:27,153
just a warning.

249
00:14:27,231 --> 00:14:32,071
Lose the stick and you will face
the wrath of the cheer gods.

250
00:14:32,136 --> 00:14:36,396
I once knew a cheerleader who
misplaced the stick for just one day

251
00:14:36,474 --> 00:14:38,204
and she broke her leg doing a
simple toe touch.

252
00:14:38,275 --> 00:14:39,535
Wait for it.

253
00:14:39,611 --> 00:14:40,871
So guard it with your lives, people.

254
00:14:40,945 --> 00:14:42,135
Wait for it.

255
00:14:42,213 --> 00:14:45,553
You will find good fortune while
it's in your possession, jets.

256
00:14:51,221 --> 00:14:52,811
Cheer smackdown.

257
00:14:53,758 --> 00:14:55,448
Words, shorty. Use your words.

258
00:14:55,526 --> 00:14:56,616
Him.

259
00:14:56,928 --> 00:14:58,488
Abs Penn.

260
00:14:59,396 --> 00:15:00,456
Go jets.

261
00:15:00,531 --> 00:15:02,521
Oh, girl. You know a cheer Crip

262
00:15:02,599 --> 00:15:04,569
can't be hitting it with a cheer Blood.

263
00:15:06,036 --> 00:15:10,496
All right. Everybody have a fun and
safe week here at Camp Spirit Thunder!

264
00:15:15,313 --> 00:15:16,683
You're a Jet?

265
00:15:16,748 --> 00:15:17,808
Yeah, that's a trip, huh?

266
00:15:17,882 --> 00:15:18,872
Why didn't you tell me?

267
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,420
What, that I was a male cheerleader?

268
00:15:21,486 --> 00:15:23,776
Sure. That's a real panty-dropper!

269
00:15:24,756 --> 00:15:26,046
Look, I didn't mean any...

270
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,745
Did Brooke tell you to play me?

271
00:15:27,824 --> 00:15:29,594
Sucks to be you, huh?

272
00:15:30,295 --> 00:15:32,125
Carson, I didn't know you were
a cheerleader.

273
00:15:32,195 --> 00:15:33,745
Like... And what's the big deal?

274
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,360
I'm a Jet. So what?

275
00:15:35,433 --> 00:15:36,533
So what?

276
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,662
I cannot have an inter-cheeracial
relationship!

277
00:15:42,273 --> 00:15:43,333
Hello?

278
00:15:43,407 --> 00:15:44,497
Greetings,Camp Spirit Thunder.

279
00:15:44,575 --> 00:15:46,765
just a friendly video postcard
from Camp Victory.

280
00:15:46,844 --> 00:15:49,474
Looking very forward to seeing
you in the Championships.

281
00:15:49,547 --> 00:15:51,407
We've got a secret weapon this year.

282
00:15:51,482 --> 00:15:53,752
Say, Pepper, how many of your
kids can throw

283
00:15:53,818 --> 00:15:56,978
a roundoff, back handspring
double-fold twist?

284
00:15:57,055 --> 00:15:58,275
Oh, none?

285
00:15:59,523 --> 00:16:01,463
Meet the new and improved Flamingos.

286
00:16:01,526 --> 00:16:03,386
See you at the...

287
00:16:03,461 --> 00:16:04,891
The Flamingos?

288
00:16:04,962 --> 00:16:06,592
They can barely stand on one leg.

289
00:16:08,232 --> 00:16:10,932
Everybody,it is all right.

290
00:16:11,001 --> 00:16:15,301
Vance Voorhees is just trying
to psyche us out. Okay?

291
00:16:15,372 --> 00:16:18,502
And it didn't work last year,
and it's not gonna work this year.

292
00:16:18,576 --> 00:16:20,336
We always win.

293
00:16:20,477 --> 00:16:22,277
Nothing's gonna stop us this week.

294
00:16:22,347 --> 00:16:24,407
Except the Sharks.

295
00:16:24,482 --> 00:16:26,752
Your little trick's not gonna
work, Brooke.

296
00:16:26,818 --> 00:16:28,788
Making sure I knew Penn was a Jet

297
00:16:28,853 --> 00:16:30,753
makes it that much easier to
resist him.

298
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:34,290
I'm no player,but I thought
I had a little game.

299
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:37,289
Sorry, Penn,but I've only got
one thing on my mind,

300
00:16:37,362 --> 00:16:39,732
and that is crushing your squad.

301
00:16:41,132 --> 00:16:43,462
Not even in your dreams, Carson.

302
00:16:44,267 --> 00:16:46,327
We're done here. Let's go.

303
00:16:54,745 --> 00:16:56,935
Hey, can you go on spiritaccessories. com

304
00:16:57,015 --> 00:17:00,075
and see if they have the key
chains that light up?

305
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:05,249
If pink is the new black,what's the new pink?

306
00:17:05,322 --> 00:17:07,662
Aeysha, I'm trying to work here.

307
00:17:08,593 --> 00:17:11,963
I have to find a killer stunt
that'll knock East Coast on their spanks.

308
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,220
Sorry.

309
00:17:14,564 --> 00:17:16,164
It doesn't matter.

310
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:17,793
I can't concentrate anyway.

311
00:17:22,774 --> 00:17:26,684
Hey, you need to get serious,
'cause I don't care how cute he is,

312
00:17:26,744 --> 00:17:28,844
we are here to win, right?

313
00:17:28,913 --> 00:17:30,613
True that, sister, yo.

314
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:34,945
Girl, go to sleep. Tomorrow is
gonna be fun.

315
00:17:45,997 --> 00:17:48,057
Five, six, seven, eight.

316
00:17:48,131 --> 00:17:51,621
Come on. My granny can jump higher
than that from her grave.

317
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:54,103
...seven, eight, one.

318
00:17:54,172 --> 00:17:56,072
Okay, Sarah,you're up.

319
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,970
Let's have a little spirit this time.

320
00:17:58,675 --> 00:18:02,735
1st and 10,do it again. Go, go

321
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,505
All right, Ruben,you're up.

322
00:18:04,582 --> 00:18:09,992
P- E-A-C-E.Peace to the Middle
East Go, planet!

323
00:18:10,054 --> 00:18:11,524
He can't do that,can he?

324
00:18:11,589 --> 00:18:14,989
I mean, if he cheers for peace,
then the terrorists win! Duh!

325
00:18:25,236 --> 00:18:28,256
Showmanship.

326
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:30,329
That's what sells the performance.

327
00:18:30,407 --> 00:18:34,107
So, I want everyone to give me big facials.

328
00:18:34,178 --> 00:18:36,078
Because you have to remember

329
00:18:36,146 --> 00:18:40,636
that points will be deducted
for bad facials, okay?

330
00:18:44,122 --> 00:18:45,612
All right. All right,you guys, now.

331
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,090
Any of those dance moves can
be used in a cheer routine.

332
00:18:48,158 --> 00:18:50,148
Since when is dance a part of
cheerleading,anyway?

333
00:18:50,228 --> 00:18:53,888
Since the world first started
recognizing that cheerleading was real.

334
00:18:53,965 --> 00:18:55,555
I mean, think about it, you guys.

335
00:18:55,633 --> 00:18:57,193
If you've got some dope cheerleading,

336
00:18:57,267 --> 00:18:58,667
you're throwing some hot dance moves

337
00:18:58,735 --> 00:19:00,065
and you got some crazy tumbling.

338
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:01,368
What do you have?

339
00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:02,599
You got a triple threat, right?

340
00:19:02,673 --> 00:19:05,013
Triple threat right here.

341
00:19:05,076 --> 00:19:06,336
Yo, I got this.

342
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,100
Okay. Okay. Bring it, boo.

343
00:19:19,489 --> 00:19:21,519
Ain't like they can hang when a sister

344
00:19:21,592 --> 00:19:24,252
gets to cracking and popping
her collarbone.

345
00:19:24,327 --> 00:19:25,787
You smell me?

346
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,690
What the hell are you doing?

347
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:31,831
I'm keeping it real,sister.

348
00:19:31,902 --> 00:19:33,372
Keeping it real for who?

349
00:19:33,437 --> 00:19:35,927
You need to just be you, okay,
boo?Just be you.

350
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,000
I love it when we win

351
00:19:42,078 --> 00:19:44,908
The only thing that's better is
when it's twice as long

352
00:19:44,982 --> 00:19:47,112
And I get a double-header

353
00:19:47,985 --> 00:19:49,345
Your cart.

354
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:57,360
First of all, we're gonna start
with happy,happy, happy.

355
00:19:57,428 --> 00:19:59,658
We're so happy to be here. Good.

356
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:00,820
All right, now,surprise.

357
00:20:02,032 --> 00:20:05,562
What just happened?I don't know
but it was wonderful.

358
00:20:05,636 --> 00:20:09,766
Uh-oh! Here comes the big wink
for you in the back, judge.

359
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,280
Big wink. There we go.

360
00:20:14,144 --> 00:20:19,014
Come on, girl. Sunshine,I have
seen better facials at a funeral

361
00:20:19,082 --> 00:20:21,752
and I'm talking about the corpses.

362
00:20:21,819 --> 00:20:23,479
Oh, we like that,do we?

363
00:20:23,553 --> 00:20:24,823
Well, let's just make that smile...

364
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,960
Oh, gosh. Okay, all right.

365
00:20:28,025 --> 00:20:30,515
Well, the workshop is over.

366
00:20:41,571 --> 00:20:43,701
Do just one facial. Come on.

367
00:20:44,475 --> 00:20:47,335
If you hate cheerleading so much,
why do you do it?

368
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,000
For Satan.

369
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,020
That's a shiny nugget I did not need to know.

370
00:20:52,415 --> 00:20:53,965
It's just like yoga, you know.

371
00:20:54,051 --> 00:20:55,541
It is.

372
00:20:59,257 --> 00:21:00,847
Satan is my car.

373
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:05,588
My parents promised me payments
and insurance if I join the squad.

374
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:09,363
Well, my parents promised me a
car if I stop cheerleading.

375
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:13,103
And if I nail a girl, I get my
own apartment.

376
00:21:13,169 --> 00:21:14,659
See, that was almost a facial.

377
00:21:14,739 --> 00:21:16,969
Yeah, in Transylvania.

378
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:18,272
Step off, Brooke.

379
00:21:18,342 --> 00:21:20,312
Who are you?Her fairy Goth-mother?

380
00:21:20,378 --> 00:21:24,008
Brooke, get over yourself,
and stop sweating my team.

381
00:21:24,081 --> 00:21:26,311
Why would anyone listen to you?

382
00:21:26,384 --> 00:21:29,184
You suck as a gymnast and
a captain, too.

383
00:21:29,786 --> 00:21:31,716
Cheer-off. Sharks!

384
00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:32,849
Yeah.

385
00:21:32,923 --> 00:21:34,913
Five, six, seven, eight.

386
00:21:34,992 --> 00:21:37,392
It don't matter what we do

387
00:21:37,461 --> 00:21:39,761
Music, baby, is our cue

388
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:42,090
Hands and shoulders,face so tight

389
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,256
All our moves will rock this fight

390
00:21:44,334 --> 00:21:47,304
Our moves are tight,we lift with ease

391
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:50,240
The things we do will make you wheeze

392
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:53,038
So watch us strike our muscle pose

393
00:21:53,109 --> 00:21:55,639
While you all prance and dosey-doe

394
00:21:55,712 --> 00:21:57,812
That was cute,your pose was dull

395
00:21:57,882 --> 00:22:00,322
But all of you have belly rolls

396
00:22:00,383 --> 00:22:02,583
Once again we groove with flare

397
00:22:02,652 --> 00:22:04,782
The moves we do,you wouldn't dare

398
00:22:04,855 --> 00:22:07,085
So listen quick while your
face gets cracked

399
00:22:07,158 --> 00:22:08,918
One, two, three, you're wack

400
00:22:08,993 --> 00:22:11,023
Your rhymes are fun, but we're still good

401
00:22:11,095 --> 00:22:13,255
We still can stunt,you're from the hood

402
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,660
Hood rats, good rats,what are you called?

403
00:22:15,733 --> 00:22:18,223
The moves you do won't win at all

404
00:22:18,302 --> 00:22:20,402
So listen quick, oops

405
00:22:20,471 --> 00:22:23,531
You said that rhyme One, two,
three, our time

406
00:22:23,606 --> 00:22:26,366
Motions, motions,hear them roar

407
00:22:26,444 --> 00:22:29,144
No one's knocking at your door

408
00:22:29,213 --> 00:22:31,373
With no rhythm and with no sass

409
00:22:31,449 --> 00:22:33,509
All of you can kiss our ass

410
00:22:33,584 --> 00:22:35,784
Dance, 10, looks, 3

411
00:22:35,853 --> 00:22:38,343
The moves you do make us all pee

412
00:22:38,421 --> 00:22:41,121
We laugh, we cry,we all say hi

413
00:22:41,192 --> 00:22:43,852
'Cause when you dance,it's bye, bye, bye

414
00:22:43,927 --> 00:22:45,357
Bye, bye

415
00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:46,419
Bye.

416
00:22:46,496 --> 00:22:47,556
Bye. Have fun.

417
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:58,538
Bye.

418
00:23:01,278 --> 00:23:03,338
Yo, that was shady,Brooke.

419
00:23:03,414 --> 00:23:05,614
Please, you totally popped a chubber.

420
00:23:05,682 --> 00:23:06,712
Hey, Brooke.

421
00:23:06,783 --> 00:23:07,773
What?

422
00:23:07,852 --> 00:23:09,912
You've got no clue,you're in the dark

423
00:23:09,987 --> 00:23:11,387
Wake up call,it's the year of the...

424
00:23:31,275 --> 00:23:32,705
Come on, babycakes.

425
00:23:32,776 --> 00:23:36,676
If we all just imagine this world's
a fabulous place, it'll happen.

426
00:23:38,114 --> 00:23:43,184
I see children frolicking under
a rainbow eating hormone-free treats.

427
00:23:44,755 --> 00:23:46,445
A unicorn.

428
00:23:47,858 --> 00:23:53,818
I see mutant turtles gnawing
on festering human flesh.

429
00:23:56,767 --> 00:23:58,597
They ate the unicorn.

430
00:24:00,704 --> 00:24:03,234
You need Jesus. Or Prozac.

431
00:24:04,908 --> 00:24:07,308
Thanks for trying to cheer me up, Ruben,

432
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:09,845
but I'm more mad at myself than Brooke.

433
00:24:10,514 --> 00:24:12,184
I let her get to me.

434
00:24:12,249 --> 00:24:13,979
That's why we lost the cheer-off.

435
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:16,082
Yeah, that bites.

436
00:24:16,219 --> 00:24:18,249
You gonna finish that steak?

437
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:35,330
Spirit to you.

438
00:24:37,073 --> 00:24:40,133
Hey, I heard you had kind of
a rough day, huh?

439
00:24:40,211 --> 00:24:42,641
But your luck's about to change.

440
00:24:42,712 --> 00:24:44,512
Okay. All right.

441
00:24:44,582 --> 00:24:47,612
Oh, West Coast Sharks,may the
luck of Herkie

442
00:24:47,685 --> 00:24:50,645
smile on you as it has for me.

443
00:24:50,955 --> 00:24:52,445
Go Sharks

444
00:24:53,057 --> 00:24:54,577
Go Sharks

445
00:24:55,192 --> 00:24:56,662
Go Sharks

446
00:24:57,461 --> 00:24:59,021
Go Sharks

447
00:24:59,596 --> 00:25:01,216
Go Sharks

448
00:25:01,832 --> 00:25:03,322
Go Sharks

449
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,590
Go Sharks

450
00:25:06,203 --> 00:25:07,263
Go Sharks

451
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:14,171
Okay, guys, we got to give props
to the spirits,

452
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:16,069
but isn't this a little extreme?

453
00:25:16,145 --> 00:25:18,705
You know how nasty some cheerleaders
can be when they're alive.

454
00:25:18,782 --> 00:25:20,982
Do you really want to risk the
dead ones hating on you?

455
00:25:21,051 --> 00:25:24,151
Then let's do this right. Look, off.

456
00:25:25,356 --> 00:25:31,816
Fire, water, earth,air, spirit stick.

457
00:25:33,063 --> 00:25:35,763
You know what this really needs to pop?

458
00:25:37,133 --> 00:25:39,003
The blood of a virgin.

459
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,370
Okay. Why are you guys looking at me?

460
00:25:45,442 --> 00:25:48,342
Come on, Carson, just a little pin prick.

461
00:25:48,411 --> 00:25:51,971
If she can take a little prick,
she wouldn't be a virgin.

462
00:25:54,451 --> 00:25:55,641
You coming?

463
00:25:55,718 --> 00:25:56,848
Hell to the yeah.

464
00:25:56,921 --> 00:25:58,051
Where?

465
00:25:58,121 --> 00:25:59,921
You wouldn't be into it.

466
00:25:59,989 --> 00:26:02,049
Cheer poker with the Prairie Dogs.

467
00:26:02,126 --> 00:26:03,816
What's the buy-in?

468
00:26:03,893 --> 00:26:05,693
Sarah, this is cheer poker.

469
00:26:05,763 --> 00:26:08,203
Sounds like easy pickings. Wait.

470
00:26:08,265 --> 00:26:10,285
Who's gonna guard the spirit stick?

471
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,900
You know what? You guys go.

472
00:26:14,972 --> 00:26:17,442
I'm captain, I'll do stick duty.

473
00:26:17,508 --> 00:26:18,738
Thanks. Thanks, boo.

474
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:20,169
What room is the poker game?

475
00:26:20,244 --> 00:26:22,244
Dumpy Dogs have a suite.

476
00:26:55,179 --> 00:26:56,409
Why can't I delete you?

477
00:27:09,994 --> 00:27:11,364
Down here.

478
00:27:11,595 --> 00:27:12,645
Penn, what are you doing?

479
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:14,130
Well, you don't answer my calls and texts,

480
00:27:14,197 --> 00:27:17,457
so I had to do it old school
and show up in person.

481
00:27:17,968 --> 00:27:19,368
Don't make me serenade you.

482
00:27:19,435 --> 00:27:21,125
Penn, you're a Jet. We can't...

483
00:27:21,205 --> 00:27:23,935
I know. I know. Look,let's
just do the rides.

484
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:26,669
No cheer talk. I promise.

485
00:27:26,744 --> 00:27:27,974
The Double-Dragon?

486
00:27:28,045 --> 00:27:30,265
Now you're talking. I'll meet you.

487
00:27:31,148 --> 00:27:32,448
Cradle.

488
00:27:56,507 --> 00:27:58,027
That was sick!

489
00:27:58,775 --> 00:27:59,935
You had fun,didn't you?

490
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,940
Hey! I know how to play, bro.

491
00:28:02,011 --> 00:28:03,071
Mmm-hmm.

492
00:28:03,146 --> 00:28:06,306
What? I take cheering seriously.

493
00:28:06,383 --> 00:28:08,183
You know,my team's counting on me.

494
00:28:08,317 --> 00:28:10,147
I'm not gonna let them down.

495
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:13,750
Word on the street? It's just summer camp.

496
00:28:13,823 --> 00:28:15,623
Yeah, maybe for you.

497
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:17,523
We worked our butts off just to get here.

498
00:28:18,327 --> 00:28:19,447
So did we.

499
00:28:19,529 --> 00:28:22,059
And we had to raise a lot of money.

500
00:28:22,132 --> 00:28:24,902
You know, wet T-shirt car washes.

501
00:28:25,436 --> 00:28:27,556
Trust me. I know.

502
00:28:27,638 --> 00:28:31,098
Anyways, winning a competition like this,

503
00:28:31,175 --> 00:28:34,135
it could really up my chance of
getting a scholarship to college.

504
00:28:34,211 --> 00:28:36,481
I even had to get a team scholarship
just to get here.

505
00:28:36,547 --> 00:28:38,337
Yeah, so did I.

506
00:28:38,415 --> 00:28:40,905
You know, it's nothing to be ashamed of.

507
00:28:40,984 --> 00:28:42,284
In my case, it is.

508
00:28:42,352 --> 00:28:43,552
What do you mean?

509
00:28:45,923 --> 00:28:47,453
Look, don't get all serious on me, skids.

510
00:28:47,523 --> 00:28:49,013
Come on.

511
00:28:52,696 --> 00:28:55,316
You fumbled on the flop We'll
trick you on the turn

512
00:28:55,399 --> 00:28:58,229
Now here comes the river and the P-Dog burn!

513
00:28:58,302 --> 00:29:01,702
You Dogs think you can fool us
Sharks at poker faces.

514
00:29:03,206 --> 00:29:06,036
You are so bluffing,Prairie Dog.
I call.

515
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:08,440
Trip cowboys. I beat that.

516
00:29:08,512 --> 00:29:11,542
How about my three bullets shoot
down your cowboys?

517
00:29:11,615 --> 00:29:13,135
P- Dogs rule!

518
00:29:13,216 --> 00:29:15,946
Oh, yeah? How about a Texas
titty twister on the house?

519
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:18,849
Hey, what are you doing?
Oh, no, what the...

520
00:29:18,922 --> 00:29:21,082
Go, go. Oh, no, we got them.

521
00:29:21,158 --> 00:29:22,518
We got his shorts.

522
00:29:25,295 --> 00:29:26,415
Look, shark.

523
00:29:28,999 --> 00:29:30,759
A world tour is no big deal to me.

524
00:29:30,834 --> 00:29:32,834
I've been overseas my whole life.

525
00:29:32,903 --> 00:29:36,273
Well, if you win again,
you can get a cheer scholarship, too.

526
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,900
To West Point?

527
00:29:38,876 --> 00:29:40,836
Okay, wait, why would you go there?

528
00:29:40,977 --> 00:29:42,967
You're a musician and a dancer.

529
00:29:44,281 --> 00:29:47,811
Yeah, well, my father is a son
of immigrants,

530
00:29:47,885 --> 00:29:49,975
and they came from nothing.

531
00:29:50,053 --> 00:29:51,653
And after he made a career out
of the military,

532
00:29:51,722 --> 00:29:53,162
he had everything.

533
00:29:53,222 --> 00:29:55,822
So, all his sons went to West Point.

534
00:29:55,893 --> 00:29:59,023
There's five of us, and well,
I'm the last one.

535
00:29:59,263 --> 00:30:03,103
So, my parents, well,
my father expects it.

536
00:30:03,167 --> 00:30:04,787
Well, can't you talk to him?

537
00:30:04,868 --> 00:30:07,858
I mean, won't he let you cheer
somewhere else?

538
00:30:09,373 --> 00:30:11,243
Wait. He doesn't know?

539
00:30:11,674 --> 00:30:13,704
My dad would spew a colon.

540
00:30:14,343 --> 00:30:17,403
I kind of told him I joined
the tae kwon do team.

541
00:30:19,016 --> 00:30:22,006
Can I tell you a secret,
but just between us?

542
00:30:22,085 --> 00:30:23,205
Sure.

543
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:34,330
What?

544
00:30:35,265 --> 00:30:38,955
Even though my family has money,
I took a team scholarship

545
00:30:39,035 --> 00:30:43,405
because I didn't want him to
find out about Cheer Camp.

546
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,400
Wow. Well, does your team know?

547
00:30:51,014 --> 00:30:52,504
Weak, huh?

548
00:30:53,984 --> 00:30:56,954
So, where does your dad think you are now?

549
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,050
Extreme Warrior Martial Arts Camp.

550
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,120
He watched me pack my nunchuks.

551
00:31:16,773 --> 00:31:19,073
Whoa, you sharks do stick together.

552
00:31:25,949 --> 00:31:27,809
Yeah, get it, get it.

553
00:31:33,489 --> 00:31:35,649
Move it. Come on, honey.

554
00:31:43,499 --> 00:31:45,189
Oh, go get Carson.

555
00:31:45,268 --> 00:31:47,128
Honey, that girl can wear a thong.

556
00:31:47,204 --> 00:31:48,874
Yeah, my girl needs to learn to hang.

557
00:31:49,005 --> 00:31:50,665
But we need to take this show to my crib.

558
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,370
She's guarding the stick there.

559
00:31:52,442 --> 00:31:54,932
Come on, you all, let's go. Let's go.

560
00:32:04,554 --> 00:32:06,384
Yo, Carson dipped out.

561
00:32:06,823 --> 00:32:08,553
And took the stick.

562
00:32:09,026 --> 00:32:10,246
Where?

563
00:32:11,161 --> 00:32:12,591
Maybe my girl learned to hang.

564
00:32:12,663 --> 00:32:14,633
Come on, let's go find her.

565
00:32:19,168 --> 00:32:21,828
You know, I should really get going.

566
00:32:21,905 --> 00:32:23,595
I just told you my darkest secret.

567
00:32:23,674 --> 00:32:25,574
Yeah, I know, but...

568
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:30,173
Look, when was the last time
you just danced for fun?

569
00:32:30,247 --> 00:32:33,237
Without being thrown in the air
every few seconds?

570
00:32:34,318 --> 00:32:36,378
A bar mitzvah three years ago.

571
00:33:01,044 --> 00:33:03,844
So, Jet boy thinks he can handle
West Coast moves?

572
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:06,505
I think Shark girl's asking the
wrong question.

573
00:33:43,486 --> 00:33:44,916
No, Carson wouldn't bring it here.

574
00:33:44,987 --> 00:33:46,287
Too many haters.

575
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,257
Where else can we look?

576
00:33:50,494 --> 00:33:52,394
I think I have an idea.

577
00:33:53,029 --> 00:33:54,499
Carson!

578
00:34:17,454 --> 00:34:18,484
Oh, no.

579
00:34:18,555 --> 00:34:19,535
What?

580
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:21,524
I'm about to have a secret, too.

581
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,920
Carson!

582
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,290
What are you guys doing here?

583
00:34:25,362 --> 00:34:27,892
Us? You need to check yourself.

584
00:34:27,964 --> 00:34:29,524
We were just hanging out.

585
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,999
Carson, give us back the spirit stick.

586
00:34:32,068 --> 00:34:34,868
You junk up its karma around
here with all these civilians.

587
00:34:34,938 --> 00:34:36,198
Ruben, it's in our room.

588
00:34:36,272 --> 00:34:37,472
No, it's not.

589
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:40,640
Why do you think we're out here
looking for you?

590
00:34:40,944 --> 00:34:44,314
Somebody jacked it, and now we
know for sure who.

591
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,680
Jets!

592
00:34:47,983 --> 00:34:50,013
jets kick ass from east to west

593
00:34:50,087 --> 00:34:52,377
And speaking of coincidence...

594
00:34:52,455 --> 00:34:54,315
You lost the spirit stick.

595
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:56,550
Ooh! You Sharks are tuna.

596
00:34:56,626 --> 00:34:57,816
Just give it back.

597
00:34:57,894 --> 00:35:00,954
Carson, this isn't a Jets prank.

598
00:35:01,031 --> 00:35:02,501
I wouldn't scam you like this.

599
00:35:02,566 --> 00:35:04,496
Come on, Carson, it's just a
big coincidence

600
00:35:04,567 --> 00:35:06,427
how he got you out of your room

601
00:35:06,503 --> 00:35:07,993
and then the spirit stick was stolen.

602
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:11,632
Seems wrong he didn't tell you
he was a Jet when he met you.

603
00:35:11,707 --> 00:35:13,637
That's right. This has cheer bitch's

604
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,610
skanky paw prints all over it!

605
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:17,239
Don't let them play us again, Carson.

606
00:35:17,314 --> 00:35:18,844
It's our year, remember?

607
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:20,466
This is so whack. Look, Carson.

608
00:35:20,549 --> 00:35:22,539
I'll help you look for the
stupid stick, all right?

609
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:23,949
What?Stupid stick?

610
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:26,281
Yeah. I'll help you look, too.

611
00:35:27,224 --> 00:35:28,714
Look, don't get all crazy
about this, okay?

612
00:35:28,792 --> 00:35:30,262
No, it's not okay.

613
00:35:30,327 --> 00:35:32,557
How can I trust someone who
lies to his own team?

614
00:35:32,629 --> 00:35:33,649
Carson.

615
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:34,920
You know, he didn't need you guys

616
00:35:34,998 --> 00:35:36,688
to raise travel money for the trip.

617
00:35:36,765 --> 00:35:39,895
He was too scared to tell his
dad about Cheer Camp.

618
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:42,030
She's a liar,right, Penn?

619
00:35:45,075 --> 00:35:47,165
No, Brooke. I should have just
believed you

620
00:35:47,243 --> 00:35:50,653
when you said Sharks and Jets
were sworn enemies.

621
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:52,475
Now I know why.

622
00:35:52,581 --> 00:35:55,051
You showed your true colors, didn't you?

623
00:35:55,118 --> 00:35:57,548
And you showed you're just a Jet.

624
00:35:59,756 --> 00:36:02,016
Have fun being cursed, losers.

625
00:36:04,761 --> 00:36:07,391
Hey, we sold candy bars for you, dude.

626
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:10,560
I'll pay you back the money, okay?

627
00:36:13,569 --> 00:36:16,099
But those Butterfingers were heavy.

628
00:36:19,976 --> 00:36:21,136
Hey, Pepper.

629
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:22,910
Heard the Sharks totally lost
the spirit stick.

630
00:36:23,046 --> 00:36:24,026
What?

631
00:36:28,118 --> 00:36:29,138
Yeah, they're over there.

632
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:30,309
Thank you. Thank you so much.

633
00:36:30,386 --> 00:36:31,646
See you.

634
00:36:42,798 --> 00:36:44,288
Uh-oh.

635
00:36:45,168 --> 00:36:49,538
So it's true. You lost my spirit stick.

636
00:36:49,606 --> 00:36:51,336
Pepper, I'm sorry. Look,
I got distracted...

637
00:36:51,408 --> 00:36:54,238
Well, it was up to you to guard
it with your lives.

638
00:36:54,311 --> 00:36:55,641
We'll find it, Pepper.

639
00:36:55,712 --> 00:36:56,972
Oh, you better.

640
00:36:57,047 --> 00:36:59,607
Yeah, so, on the real,
what happens if we don't?

641
00:36:59,683 --> 00:37:00,783
Oh, who knows?

642
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:03,320
You remember that cheerleader
I was telling you about?

643
00:37:03,385 --> 00:37:05,005
Well, after she broke her leg,

644
00:37:05,121 --> 00:37:08,111
her entire team got some kind
of nasty stomach virus,

645
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:11,560
and they all vomited on the
competition floor, all right?

646
00:37:11,628 --> 00:37:13,928
And, needless to say,everyone was happy

647
00:37:13,997 --> 00:37:16,227
to see them go home the next day,

648
00:37:16,299 --> 00:37:18,429
including the judges.

649
00:37:21,571 --> 00:37:24,061
Okay, stop! We are not cursed.

650
00:37:24,139 --> 00:37:25,799
Not even the spirit stick gods

651
00:37:25,875 --> 00:37:27,495
can take this victory away from us.

652
00:37:27,577 --> 00:37:29,407
We are going to win, damn it.

653
00:37:29,479 --> 00:37:31,309
Pyramid, seven, eight.

654
00:37:31,381 --> 00:37:33,211
One, two, three and four, five, six...

655
00:37:33,283 --> 00:37:34,513
Hey.

656
00:37:35,918 --> 00:37:37,888
You guys, get up!

657
00:37:40,289 --> 00:37:42,519
This is one fast-acting curse.

658
00:37:42,993 --> 00:37:44,523
Hey!

659
00:38:24,868 --> 00:38:26,228
Damn curse.

660
00:38:42,686 --> 00:38:44,176
Are those the Sharks? Yeah.

661
00:38:45,521 --> 00:38:47,461
Don't let them touch you.

662
00:38:49,926 --> 00:38:51,986
Let the curse be with you!

663
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:02,364
This is all the money I've got
on me right now.

664
00:39:02,471 --> 00:39:05,501
So I can give you the rest as
soon as I can, all right?

665
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:07,806
That's not what I care about.

666
00:39:12,181 --> 00:39:13,511
So, what's your deal, Penn?

667
00:39:13,582 --> 00:39:15,182
Do you want to be here or not?

668
00:39:15,251 --> 00:39:17,911
At this minute, not so much.

669
00:39:17,987 --> 00:39:19,147
I'm serious.

670
00:39:19,221 --> 00:39:21,121
We want to win.

671
00:39:21,191 --> 00:39:24,021
Now you know what kind of snakes
those Sharks really are.

672
00:39:24,126 --> 00:39:27,096
Yeah. They're like snarks.

673
00:39:27,796 --> 00:39:29,156
The enemy.

674
00:39:30,799 --> 00:39:32,389
Yeah, I get it, Chelsea.

675
00:39:32,469 --> 00:39:33,959
Do you?

676
00:39:34,037 --> 00:39:38,267
Look, I get it. You're not into me.
Nothing's gonna happen.

677
00:39:39,508 --> 00:39:41,198
But it will happen for this team.

678
00:39:41,276 --> 00:39:44,266
And the only way it's gonna work
is if we do this together.

679
00:39:44,346 --> 00:39:45,506
Yeah.

680
00:39:45,582 --> 00:39:48,522
So, you're like with us or what?

681
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:52,036
"j" to the "E" to the "T"
to the "S"

682
00:39:52,121 --> 00:39:55,181
jets kick ass from east to west!

683
00:39:55,258 --> 00:39:56,848
You know they stole the stick.

684
00:39:56,926 --> 00:40:00,356
It don't matter who took it,
we got to bust a cap in this curse.

685
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:01,830
Even Ruben thinks so now.

686
00:40:01,898 --> 00:40:04,928
You know what?I think
it's time for Sarah to do her thing.

687
00:40:05,001 --> 00:40:08,731
A cheer sacrifice?Has it really
come to that?

688
00:40:08,805 --> 00:40:12,165
Well, if it'll get us a win,
we'll do it at midnight.

689
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:26,919
O mighty fallen cheer angels,

690
00:40:26,989 --> 00:40:29,689
we summon thee from darkness.

691
00:40:29,759 --> 00:40:31,729
We're sorry about your spirit stick,

692
00:40:31,795 --> 00:40:35,555
but shouldn't you be cursing
the skanky succubae that stole it?

693
00:40:35,632 --> 00:40:36,932
Not us.

694
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,230
While you process our request,

695
00:40:40,302 --> 00:40:43,102
will you please accept our sacrifices?

696
00:40:43,172 --> 00:40:45,202
Go, spirits!

697
00:40:48,111 --> 00:40:49,741
It wouldn't hurt.

698
00:41:03,293 --> 00:41:06,693
Girl! Your lucky strapless?

699
00:41:06,763 --> 00:41:09,203
If you love something, set it free.

700
00:41:12,936 --> 00:41:16,496
Oh, my God. The cheer spirits are here.

701
00:41:16,572 --> 00:41:18,542
They don't sound cheerful.

702
00:41:19,976 --> 00:41:21,526
Maybe it was just the wind.

703
00:41:27,783 --> 00:41:30,123
That's for trying to get us
cursed, freaks!

704
00:41:30,186 --> 00:41:31,586
Yeah, except that you don't deserve.

705
00:41:31,653 --> 00:41:34,523
Like we need to steal the spirit
stick to win.

706
00:41:34,591 --> 00:41:37,991
You couldn't even beat me in
a cheer-off, loser.

707
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,120
All right, that's it. You want
a real battle?

708
00:41:40,196 --> 00:41:42,186
Sharks and Jets,right now.

709
00:41:42,265 --> 00:41:44,125
Fair fight. No contact.

710
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,430
Cheer rumble!

711
00:41:45,502 --> 00:41:46,632
Let's go.

712
00:41:46,703 --> 00:41:48,173
Yeah, let's go,you guys. Let's do this.

713
00:41:48,237 --> 00:41:50,427
Come on, you guys,go around the corner.

714
00:41:50,507 --> 00:41:52,667
Come on, guys, let's go.

715
00:41:52,742 --> 00:41:53,832
Hey, snarks.

716
00:41:53,909 --> 00:41:54,929
Bring it.

717
00:42:24,073 --> 00:42:25,203
Jets!

718
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,510
Sharks!

719
00:42:38,488 --> 00:42:39,578
Jets!

720
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:43,320
Sharks!

721
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,800
Pyramid! Higher!

722
00:43:24,534 --> 00:43:27,834
What happened tonight is an all-time,

723
00:43:27,904 --> 00:43:32,074
an all-time low for Camp Spirit Thunder!

724
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:36,080
You've just ruined this camp's
chances against Vance.

725
00:43:36,144 --> 00:43:37,634
And, even worse,

726
00:43:37,714 --> 00:43:39,514
you lost my spirit stick.

727
00:43:39,582 --> 00:43:41,552
Brooke, give Pepper back her spirit stick.

728
00:43:41,618 --> 00:43:43,378
Hey, loser,if I had the stick,

729
00:43:43,453 --> 00:43:44,983
why would my team have gotten hurt?

730
00:43:45,054 --> 00:43:46,684
Because your team started the rumble.

731
00:43:46,788 --> 00:43:49,488
You don't even deserve...

732
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:51,459
Enough!

733
00:43:51,527 --> 00:43:56,487
You kids have let down yourselves,
your camp and your country.

734
00:43:56,566 --> 00:43:57,856
Take a look around.

735
00:43:57,934 --> 00:44:01,104
Neither of you have enough team
members to compete now.

736
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:03,470
So in the morning, when you get up,

737
00:44:03,573 --> 00:44:06,773
there'll be buses here waiting
to take you all home.

738
00:44:06,843 --> 00:44:08,173
Good night!

739
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:20,449
Tomorrow, we need to whip those
little Prairie Dogs into shape.

740
00:44:20,523 --> 00:44:23,723
Then girlfriend,you'd better
pray for a miracle.

741
00:45:00,196 --> 00:45:02,246
Let's just go home and pretend

742
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:04,360
this whole sorry trip never happened.

743
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:10,300
What a nightmare.

744
00:45:20,716 --> 00:45:22,576
Where's the
spirit stick?

745
00:45:22,652 --> 00:45:25,212
Brooke, I know
you have it.

746
00:45:25,287 --> 00:45:27,947
You're still the rock star of stupid.

747
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:30,215
Why would I keep the stick and
stay cursed?

748
00:45:30,292 --> 00:45:32,282
Can we all just get over it?

749
00:45:32,361 --> 00:45:34,521
Even Paris and Nicole settled their...

750
00:45:34,597 --> 00:45:36,217
Shut up, Ruben!

751
00:45:39,302 --> 00:45:40,832
Pepper?

752
00:45:41,804 --> 00:45:47,804
Run! Flip! Jump high!You dissed
the spirits,and die, die, die!

753
00:45:47,876 --> 00:45:49,436
Pepper, let go!

754
00:45:58,454 --> 00:46:00,354
What the hell?

755
00:46:00,423 --> 00:46:02,053
Brooke didn't steal the spirit stick.

756
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:04,215
She would've given it back by
now to get rid of the curse.

757
00:46:04,293 --> 00:46:07,093
Whatever! She is still a sick
individual.

758
00:46:07,162 --> 00:46:11,122
Now, just go to sleep. I don't
need any more drama tonight, okay?

759
00:46:14,303 --> 00:46:18,433
But that means Penn had nothing
to do with it, either.

760
00:46:48,671 --> 00:46:50,301
You guys,we can't leave like this.

761
00:46:50,372 --> 00:46:51,972
It's like we're giving up.

762
00:46:52,041 --> 00:46:54,101
I promised you guys a win,

763
00:46:54,177 --> 00:46:56,807
and we're going to get one.

764
00:47:01,817 --> 00:47:03,107
Pretty.

765
00:47:09,692 --> 00:47:11,962
Brooke,I don't think you stole
the spirit stick anymore.

766
00:47:12,027 --> 00:47:14,717
Like I give a flying tuck what you think.

767
00:47:14,831 --> 00:47:16,131
Well, I do think you want to win

768
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:17,759
Camp Championships as much as I do.

769
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:19,134
So what?

770
00:47:19,202 --> 00:47:20,672
Well, if there was any chance
to stay and compete,

771
00:47:20,736 --> 00:47:22,166
you'd consider it, right?

772
00:47:22,238 --> 00:47:23,728
Even if it meant coming together.

773
00:47:24,106 --> 00:47:25,466
Ew! That's like cheer-cest!

774
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:28,170
Chelsea, I meant combining our teams.

775
00:47:28,377 --> 00:47:29,967
Look, it's about not quitting.

776
00:47:30,046 --> 00:47:32,166
Pepper wants her camp to win,
I think she'll help us.

777
00:47:32,248 --> 00:47:33,508
Brilliant plan, Carson.

778
00:47:33,583 --> 00:47:35,783
Look, I think the Jets are already
on the spirits' hit list.

779
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:38,182
Because of you.

780
00:47:38,254 --> 00:47:42,124
Okay, well,if we leave now,
we'll all stay cursed.

781
00:47:42,191 --> 00:47:43,781
Come on, Brooke.

782
00:47:47,964 --> 00:47:50,404
Boo that, freak!We're out of here.

783
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,130
Penn?

784
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:03,470
Look, I'm sorry for...

785
00:48:03,546 --> 00:48:05,876
Well, it's kind of a long list.

786
00:48:07,716 --> 00:48:09,206
Later, Carson.

787
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:12,791
You can call me skids!

788
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:20,385
What?

789
00:48:20,463 --> 00:48:23,163
You wanted me to say yes to
Hilary Duff light?

790
00:48:23,232 --> 00:48:24,632
Strap on a pair, Penn.

791
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:26,070
Can I borrow yours?

792
00:48:26,135 --> 00:48:28,725
Don't even try to out-bitch me.

793
00:48:28,804 --> 00:48:31,244
Yeah. Brooke's like the
Olym-bitch champion.

794
00:48:31,307 --> 00:48:32,467
No doubt.

795
00:48:32,541 --> 00:48:34,101
I just never pegged you for a quitter.

796
00:48:34,176 --> 00:48:35,696
I'm not quitting, Penn.

797
00:48:35,777 --> 00:48:38,207
I'm embracing my future.

798
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,080
Which is freaking bright!

799
00:48:40,148 --> 00:48:42,048
Everyone says so.

800
00:48:42,118 --> 00:48:44,418
They say a lot of other stuff
about her, too, you know.

801
00:48:44,486 --> 00:48:46,106
Shut up, Chelsea!

802
00:49:03,606 --> 00:49:04,826
Okay, we're in.

803
00:49:04,907 --> 00:49:06,067
Yes.

804
00:49:08,576 --> 00:49:10,006
I'm captain, of course.

805
00:49:11,247 --> 00:49:13,177
You two perform together?

806
00:49:13,249 --> 00:49:15,619
In what? A cheer death match?

807
00:49:15,686 --> 00:49:17,046
No. We would be...

808
00:49:17,118 --> 00:49:19,018
Co-captains.

809
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:22,780
Pepper, even with only half
our squads,

810
00:49:22,857 --> 00:49:25,117
we've still got the best
cheerleaders in camp.

811
00:49:25,194 --> 00:49:29,154
Hey, P-Dog! It is only a jump
if your feet come off the ground.

812
00:49:29,231 --> 00:49:30,531
Okay, hon?Whatever.

813
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:33,299
Pep, I'm trying to tell you,
these Prairie Dogs are so bad,

814
00:49:33,369 --> 00:49:35,099
they can't even roll over.

815
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:37,200
Don't give up on them yet.

816
00:49:38,007 --> 00:49:42,567
Come on, you all. One, two, three,
four,five, six, seven, eight.

817
00:49:42,645 --> 00:49:45,805
Two, two, three, four...

818
00:49:47,817 --> 00:49:51,747
We are the Flamingos!We are
the Flamingos!

819
00:49:51,821 --> 00:49:53,911
Look. Please give us a second chance.

820
00:49:53,989 --> 00:49:56,389
Sorry, don't believe in those,
angel pants. So you all just...

821
00:49:56,459 --> 00:49:58,159
We are the Flamingos!

822
00:49:58,228 --> 00:50:01,988
We are the Flamingos!We are
the Flamingos!

823
00:50:02,064 --> 00:50:03,124
Damn.

824
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:05,389
No Flamingo could throw down
like that last year.

825
00:50:05,467 --> 00:50:08,487
Get out of my camp,Voorhees!

826
00:50:08,571 --> 00:50:10,441
Hey, we're just passing through,ma'am.

827
00:50:10,505 --> 00:50:12,835
Don't get your scort in a twist.

828
00:50:14,677 --> 00:50:18,507
Wouldn't it be fun to,like,
rip him a new one in Championships?

829
00:50:20,416 --> 00:50:22,466
All right, you guys. We called
you out here to tell you

830
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:24,380
that Pepper got us approved
with the council.

831
00:50:24,453 --> 00:50:26,393
And now all we need is a new name.

832
00:50:26,454 --> 00:50:28,554
I was thinking the East-West Spirit?

833
00:50:28,624 --> 00:50:30,924
Ain't that an Amtrak train?

834
00:50:30,993 --> 00:50:34,953
Why can't we have a cool name,
like TomKat or Bennifer?

835
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:36,690
How about the Jarks?

836
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:38,627
How about

837
00:50:38,701 --> 00:50:40,071
the Sharts?

838
00:50:42,605 --> 00:50:44,295
How about the Shets?

839
00:50:44,373 --> 00:50:47,933
I mean, I don't see you guys
coming up with something better.

840
00:50:48,009 --> 00:50:50,099
All right. We're the Shets.

841
00:50:50,179 --> 00:50:52,479
Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm. This ain't gonna work.

842
00:50:52,548 --> 00:50:54,168
Remember what happened to Tupac
and Biggie?

843
00:50:54,249 --> 00:50:55,909
We'll make it work.

844
00:50:55,984 --> 00:50:57,454
We're combining the best parts
of both routines,

845
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,540
so get up!Get up. Up, guys.

846
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:01,220
Come on, you guys,positions. Get up!

847
00:51:09,965 --> 00:51:12,015
Penn and Chelsea,get in the back.

848
00:51:13,269 --> 00:51:15,829
I so don't do the back row.
Tell her, Brooke.

849
00:51:15,904 --> 00:51:19,314
Why doesn't Goth-a-sauraus
step to the back?

850
00:51:19,375 --> 00:51:21,265
Because Goth...

851
00:51:21,343 --> 00:51:23,333
Sarah can dance her little ass off.

852
00:51:23,412 --> 00:51:25,572
Now let's try this. Come on.

853
00:51:28,184 --> 00:51:29,674
Chels, please.

854
00:51:32,587 --> 00:51:34,557
Five, six, seven, eight.

855
00:51:34,623 --> 00:51:38,793
One, two, three, four,five, six,
seven and eight.

856
00:51:38,861 --> 00:51:40,561
Ready? Try it.

857
00:51:40,663 --> 00:51:42,693
Five, six, seven, eight.

858
00:51:42,765 --> 00:51:46,755
One, two, three,four, five,
six. Two more.

859
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:50,767
One, two, three,four, five,
six... Last one.

860
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:54,830
One, two, three, four,five, six,
seven and eight.

861
00:51:56,745 --> 00:51:58,105
I got this.

862
00:52:09,457 --> 00:52:11,947
All right, everybody,that was
great. We got the fever.

863
00:52:12,027 --> 00:52:14,287
Yeah, bite me.

864
00:52:14,363 --> 00:52:15,993
You're doing great, honey.

865
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:22,890
Hey, Penn.

866
00:52:22,972 --> 00:52:24,002
I...

867
00:52:24,073 --> 00:52:25,973
I'll be back before next practice.

868
00:52:26,041 --> 00:52:27,771
You know, I was hoping that
we could talk.

869
00:52:27,843 --> 00:52:29,613
And by talk I mean,

870
00:52:29,678 --> 00:52:32,698
you know, I thought that maybe
we could have a do-over.

871
00:52:32,781 --> 00:52:36,551
Do-over? Carson,I think we're done.

872
00:52:36,618 --> 00:52:40,678
Look, Penn, I'm sorry I accused
you of stealing the spirit stick,

873
00:52:40,757 --> 00:52:42,987
and, of course,embarrassing you

874
00:52:43,058 --> 00:52:45,248
and telling everyone your darkest secret.

875
00:52:45,327 --> 00:52:47,087
That was bad, but...

876
00:52:49,098 --> 00:52:51,188
This could be going better.

877
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,130
Look, Carson,I'm gonna work my
ass off to help our team win.

878
00:52:56,205 --> 00:52:57,725
But you and me,

879
00:52:57,806 --> 00:52:59,426
I think we should stick to our
own coasts.

880
00:52:59,507 --> 00:53:01,097
All right?

881
00:53:06,515 --> 00:53:09,135
Seven, eight.

882
00:53:09,218 --> 00:53:15,878
One, two, three, four,five, six,
seven, eight.

883
00:53:17,393 --> 00:53:24,923
One, two, three, four,five, six,
seven, eight.

884
00:53:40,515 --> 00:53:41,635
Tight work.

885
00:54:01,403 --> 00:54:02,803
Hey!

886
00:54:10,713 --> 00:54:12,153
Pepper's lost her mind.

887
00:54:12,214 --> 00:54:14,554
I think she put out an AMBER
Alert, too.

888
00:54:14,617 --> 00:54:16,277
Man, I'd love to know who took it.

889
00:54:16,352 --> 00:54:19,122
I smell P-Dog.

890
00:54:19,187 --> 00:54:20,377
No.

891
00:54:20,456 --> 00:54:21,916
I bet it was the Flamingos.

892
00:54:21,991 --> 00:54:24,981
Look, either way,let's just
hope the curse is done.

893
00:54:25,059 --> 00:54:26,619
We need all the help we can get.

894
00:54:26,695 --> 00:54:27,955
You know what?You're right.

895
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:29,890
Let's practice our routine one more time.

896
00:54:31,634 --> 00:54:33,364
What? You guys! Ow!

897
00:54:52,888 --> 00:54:55,148
Get it, boy. You better work it.

898
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:22,950
Bet I can cheer you up.

899
00:55:24,452 --> 00:55:26,252
Don't be a wad, Penn.

900
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:29,380
Go find Carson.

901
00:55:31,292 --> 00:55:32,392
Excuse me?

902
00:55:32,461 --> 00:55:33,491
Yeah, I know.

903
00:55:33,562 --> 00:55:35,392
Never thought I'd say those words.

904
00:55:35,463 --> 00:55:39,563
But, hey, if you're into a bony
ass and cankles,then what the hell.

905
00:55:39,634 --> 00:55:42,304
Knot up! Go get her, fool.

906
00:55:42,371 --> 00:55:44,531
Yeah, but after she ratted me out

907
00:55:44,606 --> 00:55:46,696
I can't make myself trust her, you know.

908
00:55:46,774 --> 00:55:48,004
Why not?

909
00:55:48,944 --> 00:55:50,674
Damn.

910
00:55:50,745 --> 00:55:52,365
I must be insane.

911
00:55:53,716 --> 00:55:55,736
Doesn't mean I have to be.

912
00:55:57,653 --> 00:55:59,553
Do what you want, Penn.

913
00:55:59,621 --> 00:56:01,991
But don't be a pendejo.

914
00:56:05,227 --> 00:56:07,557
Brooke, thanks.

915
00:56:10,866 --> 00:56:12,126
Whatever.

916
00:56:16,238 --> 00:56:17,798
By the way,

917
00:56:17,873 --> 00:56:19,133
your loss.

918
00:56:19,207 --> 00:56:20,937
I'm double-jointed.

919
00:56:24,813 --> 00:56:26,753
Five, six, seven, eight. One,
two, three, four,

920
00:56:26,815 --> 00:56:30,105
five, six, seven, eight. One,
two, three, four,

921
00:56:30,185 --> 00:56:31,735
five, six, seven, eight.

922
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:33,120
One, and two,and three, and four... Hey!

923
00:56:33,187 --> 00:56:35,417
Ever heard of this new thing
called counting?

924
00:56:35,491 --> 00:56:37,251
Everybody stretch! Now!

925
00:56:37,326 --> 00:56:39,286
Ever heard of team work?Shut up, Carson.

926
00:56:39,361 --> 00:56:40,591
Yo, watch it, cuz.

927
00:56:40,662 --> 00:56:41,862
Yo, stop fronting, cuz.

928
00:56:41,964 --> 00:56:43,594
I heard you with Chicago.

929
00:56:43,665 --> 00:56:45,215
You're not just an Oreo,Aeysha.

930
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:46,430
You're double-stuffed.

931
00:56:46,502 --> 00:56:47,592
You're wrong, Brooke!

932
00:56:47,669 --> 00:56:50,999
My girl, she been pulling
drive-bys since she was a shorty.

933
00:56:51,072 --> 00:56:52,442
Yo, she was drinking 40s off
the nipple.

934
00:56:52,508 --> 00:56:53,598
Carson?

935
00:56:53,675 --> 00:56:55,665
So, don't be getting up on her
Kool-Aid, biatch,

936
00:56:55,743 --> 00:56:57,473
'cause I have seen what she's done

937
00:56:57,546 --> 00:57:00,376
to fugly swamp donkeys like you,
fo shizzle.

938
00:57:01,282 --> 00:57:03,622
Carson, it's over.

939
00:57:03,685 --> 00:57:04,705
Are you sure?

940
00:57:04,787 --> 00:57:07,547
I cannot watch you "fo shizzle"
ever again.

941
00:57:09,191 --> 00:57:10,281
Good.

942
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:20,739
Look, you all. All this,"Girl,
please" and cursing,

943
00:57:20,804 --> 00:57:22,334
it ain't me.

944
00:57:22,403 --> 00:57:24,303
I mean, it isn't me.

945
00:57:24,373 --> 00:57:26,843
I just did it to get your respect.

946
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:28,880
See, the real Aeysha got teased every day

947
00:57:28,944 --> 00:57:30,914
in junior high for being an Oreo.

948
00:57:30,979 --> 00:57:34,609
You know,black on the outside,
white on the inside.

949
00:57:34,683 --> 00:57:37,213
And I've been hood ratting it
up ever since.

950
00:57:38,954 --> 00:57:40,254
You're whiter than me.

951
00:57:40,322 --> 00:57:43,522
Maybe so, but,that's who I am.

952
00:57:43,592 --> 00:57:45,992
Just a black girl who enunciates.

953
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:50,490
Do you have something to say?

954
00:57:50,565 --> 00:57:54,225
Hey, if you want respect that badly,

955
00:57:54,302 --> 00:57:56,362
just be a bitch, like me.

956
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,070
Same respect,half the effort.

957
00:58:00,875 --> 00:58:02,425
Guess the bitch is out of the bag.

958
00:58:02,511 --> 00:58:04,001
Truth out!

959
00:58:07,049 --> 00:58:08,519
I'm a virgin.

960
00:58:12,654 --> 00:58:14,144
Technically.

961
00:58:14,223 --> 00:58:16,623
I just act that way so guys
will like me.

962
00:58:16,691 --> 00:58:19,131
But it's really hard being slutty
all the time.

963
00:58:19,194 --> 00:58:21,684
I don't know how you do it, Brooke.

964
00:58:28,971 --> 00:58:32,911
My parents aren't bribing me
to be a cheerleader.

965
00:58:32,975 --> 00:58:36,035
I do it because cheerleading is dark

966
00:58:36,111 --> 00:58:37,771
and twisted.

967
00:58:37,845 --> 00:58:38,935
Are you high?

968
00:58:39,014 --> 00:58:40,884
No. Think about it.

969
00:58:40,949 --> 00:58:42,379
We cheer for the other team's failure

970
00:58:42,452 --> 00:58:46,222
just as much as we cheer for
own team's victory.

971
00:58:46,288 --> 00:58:47,948
That's so twisted.

972
00:58:48,022 --> 00:58:49,292
Sarah?

973
00:58:49,358 --> 00:58:51,918
Okay, I'm a little high.

974
00:58:51,995 --> 00:58:53,615
Yo, this is like confession.

975
00:58:55,597 --> 00:58:57,827
I'm out of here.

976
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,160
No, wait.

977
00:59:01,603 --> 00:59:02,973
I have something to confess.

978
00:59:03,038 --> 00:59:04,368
This should be good.

979
00:59:04,438 --> 00:59:06,198
Miss USA has a secret.

980
00:59:06,274 --> 00:59:08,744
Spill, Tara Connor.

981
00:59:08,810 --> 00:59:10,370
I'm scared.

982
00:59:10,444 --> 00:59:11,844
It's okay, Carson.

983
00:59:11,914 --> 00:59:13,354
You can do it.

984
00:59:13,415 --> 00:59:15,905
No, that's it.

985
00:59:15,984 --> 00:59:17,354
I'm scared.

986
00:59:20,156 --> 00:59:21,446
You know, I act like the
fearless captain

987
00:59:21,523 --> 00:59:22,783
who's not afraid to go for it,

988
00:59:22,857 --> 00:59:27,587
but, in reality,going for it
is my biggest fear.

989
00:59:27,663 --> 00:59:29,833
I'm so confused.

990
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:32,299
But don't let it stop you, I mean,
it happens all the time.

991
00:59:32,367 --> 00:59:35,097
Yeah. What I meant was,

992
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:37,160
I just wish I could believe in myself

993
00:59:37,238 --> 00:59:39,608
as much as I believe in all of you.

994
00:59:48,249 --> 00:59:49,679
I'm not gay.

995
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,580
I like girls

996
00:59:53,654 --> 00:59:55,384
a lot.

997
00:59:55,457 --> 00:59:57,047
Are you serious?

998
00:59:58,359 --> 01:00:00,619
I'm straight.

999
01:00:00,696 --> 01:00:04,786
You girls just assumed,

1000
01:00:04,865 --> 01:00:09,455
so once you started changing in
front of me, I couldn't stop you.

1001
01:00:09,538 --> 01:00:13,028
And then, I was like committed.

1002
01:00:13,108 --> 01:00:14,628
Hold up.

1003
01:00:14,709 --> 01:00:18,079
There's no way this guy's not gay,
and I'll prove it.

1004
01:00:23,385 --> 01:00:24,815
Okay.

1005
01:00:24,886 --> 01:00:26,376
He is not gay.

1006
01:00:26,454 --> 01:00:28,754
No, but he is dead.

1007
01:00:28,824 --> 01:00:30,494
Get him. Get him.

1008
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:38,630
Hey, Mom. Hey, can I speak to
the General?

1009
01:00:39,701 --> 01:00:41,071
All right.

1010
01:00:43,505 --> 01:00:45,055
Hello, sir.

1011
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:46,800
No, everything's fine.

1012
01:00:46,874 --> 01:00:48,644
I'm fine.

1013
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:50,200
No, I'm great.

1014
01:00:52,814 --> 01:00:56,254
Actually, I'm not at Warrior
Camp exactly.

1015
01:00:56,318 --> 01:00:57,978
I'm at Cheer Camp.

1016
01:01:00,422 --> 01:01:03,952
Because I'm a cheerleader.

1017
01:01:05,861 --> 01:01:07,521
Yes, one of those.

1018
01:01:11,033 --> 01:01:12,593
Sir?

1019
01:01:12,668 --> 01:01:14,138
Dad?

1020
01:01:14,201 --> 01:01:15,191
Dad!

1021
01:01:17,305 --> 01:01:18,895
Listen.

1022
01:01:18,974 --> 01:01:20,704
This is the funny thing,
when you hear the rest,

1023
01:01:20,776 --> 01:01:23,966
cheerleading is gonna sound
like the good part.

1024
01:01:25,646 --> 01:01:27,266
About West Point...

1025
01:01:28,383 --> 01:01:32,083
Okay, that was traumatic but good, right?

1026
01:01:32,154 --> 01:01:33,594
I mean, now we can work as a team.

1027
01:01:33,655 --> 01:01:36,015
Yeah. A team of freaks.

1028
01:01:36,091 --> 01:01:38,291
We are not a team, okay?

1029
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:41,820
We can't combine routines and
this was a dumbass idea!

1030
01:01:42,764 --> 01:01:45,164
Tell them, Ruben. We can do this.

1031
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:49,000
We blow. We cannot do this.

1032
01:01:49,104 --> 01:01:51,544
Because we're cursed, all of us.

1033
01:01:51,605 --> 01:01:54,575
Holy crap, Ruben, snap out of it!

1034
01:01:56,011 --> 01:01:58,451
What have you done with happy Ruben?

1035
01:01:58,513 --> 01:01:59,983
It's weird, you know.

1036
01:02:00,048 --> 01:02:02,178
Now that I'm not gay anymore,

1037
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:04,050
I'm not gay anymore.

1038
01:02:04,118 --> 01:02:05,638
Okay, we're freaks!

1039
01:02:05,721 --> 01:02:07,191
But let's make that work for us.

1040
01:02:07,255 --> 01:02:09,515
Come on, you guys. I mean,
there has to be some way

1041
01:02:09,590 --> 01:02:11,820
that we can perform together.

1042
01:02:13,895 --> 01:02:15,945
We can start with couples.

1043
01:02:36,717 --> 01:02:37,977
I'll take the lead.

1044
01:02:38,053 --> 01:02:39,283
So, like, we're gonna copy them?

1045
01:02:39,354 --> 01:02:41,124
I'm gonna move to the right
then to the left.

1046
01:02:41,188 --> 01:02:42,618
Okay.

1047
01:02:42,691 --> 01:02:43,781
Start up like that, all right?

1048
01:02:43,859 --> 01:02:44,879
Okay.

1049
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,620
Here we go.

1050
01:02:46,695 --> 01:02:47,845
Hey, you want to try this?

1051
01:02:47,928 --> 01:02:49,018
There you go.

1052
01:02:50,465 --> 01:02:51,795
Top again.

1053
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:57,400
All right, top again. Here we go.

1054
01:03:03,712 --> 01:03:06,442
Give me a turn. There you go.

1055
01:03:35,544 --> 01:03:36,814
For real.

1056
01:03:38,914 --> 01:03:40,384
This could work.

1057
01:03:40,448 --> 01:03:42,848
And I'll prove it. Get over here.

1058
01:03:45,152 --> 01:03:47,882
All right, everybody ready?
From the top.

1059
01:03:47,956 --> 01:03:50,516
Look, I'm cool about you coming
out of the straight closet.

1060
01:03:50,591 --> 01:03:52,791
Please, you're just saying that
so I'll try to catch you.

1061
01:03:52,861 --> 01:03:54,421
Try?

1062
01:03:54,496 --> 01:03:57,466
All right. Five, six, seven, eight.

1063
01:04:51,887 --> 01:04:53,857
That was tight. You know what?

1064
01:04:53,989 --> 01:04:55,959
I think we could actually win this.

1065
01:04:58,260 --> 01:04:59,730
Maybe we should make sure.

1066
01:04:59,794 --> 01:05:04,034
"Compare the opposing army so
you may know where strength lies. "

1067
01:05:04,099 --> 01:05:05,259
Recon?

1068
01:05:11,572 --> 01:05:13,602
Hey, guys. We need to get some disguises.

1069
01:05:20,682 --> 01:05:22,912
They practice on stage 70A. Find it.

1070
01:05:22,983 --> 01:05:25,013
Cell phones ready?

1071
01:05:25,086 --> 01:05:27,706
Recon positions by texting only. Break!

1072
01:05:43,571 --> 01:05:45,301
Chels,

1073
01:05:45,373 --> 01:05:47,243
I'm right next to you.

1074
01:06:03,858 --> 01:06:05,188
Thank you.

1075
01:06:13,768 --> 01:06:15,528
Hey, Ron, get the gate for me.

1076
01:06:17,405 --> 01:06:19,265
Hello, Mr. Voorhees.

1077
01:06:19,341 --> 01:06:21,171
The Flamingos just started...

1078
01:06:21,243 --> 01:06:23,213
Listen, we have got to tighten
up the security.

1079
01:06:23,278 --> 01:06:25,638
I need more time for my Flamingos...

1080
01:06:26,214 --> 01:06:28,014
Keep up the good work.

1081
01:06:30,652 --> 01:06:33,142
I guess your father would laugh
at us, huh?

1082
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:35,280
He's not big into laughter.

1083
01:06:35,357 --> 01:06:38,047
You know, I told him everything.

1084
01:06:38,125 --> 01:06:39,245
Really?

1085
01:06:39,326 --> 01:06:41,796
Then what'd he say about you
being a cheerleader?

1086
01:06:41,863 --> 01:06:43,893
Well, that he laughed at.

1087
01:06:46,501 --> 01:06:48,731
Hey, covert cheer-ops.

1088
01:06:49,371 --> 01:06:51,131
Two-to-one pyramid.

1089
01:06:54,074 --> 01:06:57,274
All right, Ruben, Eric, Nick,
you three in the corner, be the base.

1090
01:06:57,345 --> 01:07:00,035
Come on, guys, hurry up. Let's go.

1091
01:07:00,114 --> 01:07:01,604
Chelsea, watch out for the guard.

1092
01:07:01,683 --> 01:07:04,553
Brooke, first level. All right.

1093
01:07:04,618 --> 01:07:06,448
One, two, three.

1094
01:07:07,989 --> 01:07:09,719
All right. Now, Carson.

1095
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:11,422
One, two, three.

1096
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:22,240
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

1097
01:07:22,303 --> 01:07:24,533
I don't want to see any loose knees.

1098
01:07:24,606 --> 01:07:27,036
Jason, that's on the two.
You're always late.

1099
01:07:27,108 --> 01:07:28,868
Wait, how did you guys get in here?

1100
01:07:28,943 --> 01:07:32,813
Seriously, that guy wasn't
even a real guard.

1101
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:35,410
"If an enemy leaves the door open,
you must rush in. "

1102
01:07:35,483 --> 01:07:36,883
Art of War.

1103
01:07:38,085 --> 01:07:39,485
Base, keep it together now.

1104
01:07:39,553 --> 01:07:42,963
I really want to see you attack
the ground. Oh, yeah!

1105
01:07:45,093 --> 01:07:46,753
Oh, my gosh.

1106
01:07:46,828 --> 01:07:48,628
Welcome to cheer-topia.

1107
01:07:48,696 --> 01:07:50,856
State of the art everything.

1108
01:07:52,067 --> 01:07:53,757
Is that Letty Trotter?

1109
01:07:53,834 --> 01:07:55,304
Choreographer to the stars?

1110
01:07:55,370 --> 01:07:56,530
That look on your faces,

1111
01:07:56,604 --> 01:07:58,764
that's the same look I had after
my divorce.

1112
01:07:58,839 --> 01:08:01,139
So sad to see a dream die.

1113
01:08:02,544 --> 01:08:05,344
Anyhoo, give my best to Pepper,
would you?

1114
01:08:09,983 --> 01:08:12,383
Vance wasn't bluffing.

1115
01:08:12,454 --> 01:08:14,484
Their tumbling is amazing.

1116
01:08:14,557 --> 01:08:15,647
Those Flamingos are like...

1117
01:08:15,722 --> 01:08:17,282
Better than us.

1118
01:08:17,892 --> 01:08:19,622
We need to come up with something
really good.

1119
01:08:19,727 --> 01:08:20,747
No, really?

1120
01:08:20,828 --> 01:08:22,418
I thought we'd come up with
something bad

1121
01:08:22,497 --> 01:08:24,057
and see if we can win that way.

1122
01:08:24,132 --> 01:08:27,292
Sorry, it's a reflex.

1123
01:08:27,367 --> 01:08:28,387
What are we going to do?

1124
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:30,270
Look, I don't know, okay?
I can't believe it.

1125
01:08:30,338 --> 01:08:33,968
After all this, I just wanted
to win Camp Championships once.

1126
01:08:34,041 --> 01:08:35,371
Don't freak out, Carson.

1127
01:08:35,443 --> 01:08:38,113
Yeah, easy for you to say. You've won.

1128
01:08:41,649 --> 01:08:44,639
Look, our dance routine is
better than theirs.

1129
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:47,119
We just need a triple threat.

1130
01:08:47,188 --> 01:08:49,618
Let's think. What would Sun Tzu do?

1131
01:08:53,327 --> 01:08:56,817
"Make use of concubines
who are greedy for gold. "

1132
01:09:06,341 --> 01:09:08,671
I don't think Sun Tzu would be
riding a rollercoaster, Carson.

1133
01:09:08,742 --> 01:09:10,712
You see how the red and blue rails loop?

1134
01:09:10,778 --> 01:09:12,538
Criss-cross and then corkscrew away?

1135
01:09:12,614 --> 01:09:14,604
Yeah, almost like a double helix.

1136
01:09:15,717 --> 01:09:17,547
That'll be the path of the two flyers.

1137
01:09:17,619 --> 01:09:18,609
Sweet! Sweet!

1138
01:09:18,687 --> 01:09:20,377
No one's ever done that before.

1139
01:09:20,455 --> 01:09:22,315
We're gonna need something new
if we want to win.

1140
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:24,650
Imagine if we pull it off.
That would be sick!

1141
01:09:24,759 --> 01:09:26,189
It'd be awesome. So cool!

1142
01:09:26,261 --> 01:09:28,531
But is it possible?

1143
01:09:28,596 --> 01:09:31,456
Yeah, it's gonna be really
difficult for the flyers.

1144
01:09:31,533 --> 01:09:33,193
Who's gonna do it?

1145
01:09:34,369 --> 01:09:35,929
Five, six, seven, eight...

1146
01:10:03,096 --> 01:10:04,256
You okay?

1147
01:10:04,332 --> 01:10:05,422
Yeah. I'm fine.

1148
01:10:05,499 --> 01:10:07,559
All right, you guys, let's do it again.

1149
01:10:21,516 --> 01:10:24,636
One, two, three, four, five, six...

1150
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:58,415
Hey, Aeysha, who taught you to sew?

1151
01:10:58,486 --> 01:10:59,746
Martha Stewart.

1152
01:10:59,821 --> 01:11:02,411
All right. One portable hot press.

1153
01:11:02,489 --> 01:11:04,519
Nice work. Where'd you find that?

1154
01:11:04,592 --> 01:11:08,552
Concierges can do anything all
over the world.

1155
01:11:08,629 --> 01:11:11,959
You'll see for yourself
when we win tomorrow.

1156
01:11:18,306 --> 01:11:20,496
Where in the world of competition sports

1157
01:11:20,574 --> 01:11:22,514
will you find two arch rivals,

1158
01:11:22,577 --> 01:11:24,737
forced by a dramatic twist of fate,

1159
01:11:24,812 --> 01:11:26,942
to join teams and combine their styles

1160
01:11:27,015 --> 01:11:29,105
to face a mysterious new challenger?

1161
01:11:29,182 --> 01:11:32,452
Well, right here at the All Star
Cheer Camp Championships,

1162
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:34,540
where one of these teams will
win the title

1163
01:11:34,622 --> 01:11:36,522
and the right to represent
the United States

1164
01:11:36,590 --> 01:11:38,460
in the World Cheer Exhibition Tour.

1165
01:11:38,527 --> 01:11:39,817
And who will that be?

1166
01:11:46,166 --> 01:11:51,096
Up next on Cheer TV, the most
exciting cheerleading in the world!

1167
01:11:51,171 --> 01:11:53,111
All right. All right. All right.
Ladies and gentlemen,

1168
01:11:53,173 --> 01:11:55,443
boys and girls, moms and dads,

1169
01:11:55,510 --> 01:11:58,570
welcome to the All Star Cheer
Camp Championship!

1170
01:12:00,415 --> 01:12:01,775
You guys look great.

1171
01:12:01,848 --> 01:12:03,608
All right. Well, let's not
waste any more time.

1172
01:12:03,685 --> 01:12:06,705
Let's bring out our first people,
representing Camp Victory,

1173
01:12:06,789 --> 01:12:10,219
ladies and gentlemen, make a
lot of noise for Sebring!

1174
01:12:34,614 --> 01:12:37,854
PEPPER.. Thank you, Prairie Dogs.
Good luck in the competition.

1175
01:12:37,919 --> 01:12:41,379
Next up on the practice pad,
the Flamingos.

1176
01:12:51,198 --> 01:12:54,128
...three, four, five, six,
seven, eight.

1177
01:13:05,847 --> 01:13:06,967
Yeah.

1178
01:13:19,227 --> 01:13:20,217
Yeah!

1179
01:13:20,328 --> 01:13:21,918
Yeah! Good job.

1180
01:13:22,864 --> 01:13:24,834
All right. All right!

1181
01:13:26,134 --> 01:13:27,934
Great job, Sebring!

1182
01:13:29,102 --> 01:13:30,632
They really brought it, didn't they?

1183
01:13:30,705 --> 01:13:34,365
Another fantastic routine. Am I right?

1184
01:13:35,143 --> 01:13:37,643
Yeah! Are you ready for another?

1185
01:13:38,112 --> 01:13:40,242
All right! All the way from
South Dakota,

1186
01:13:40,313 --> 01:13:42,413
give it up for the Prairie Dogs!

1187
01:13:42,483 --> 01:13:44,543
Don't forget your lock out.

1188
01:13:52,093 --> 01:13:54,823
All right, guys, let's run it.
Five, six...

1189
01:15:08,369 --> 01:15:10,299
This is a cheer-saster.

1190
01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:12,300
A cheer-tastrophe.

1191
01:15:12,907 --> 01:15:15,567
A total cheer-clipse of the sun.

1192
01:15:15,644 --> 01:15:16,634
Not bad. Good one.

1193
01:15:16,710 --> 01:15:17,730
Yes.

1194
01:15:17,812 --> 01:15:19,252
Look, no, you guys are all wrong, okay.

1195
01:15:19,313 --> 01:15:21,253
We're still good. We just...

1196
01:15:21,314 --> 01:15:23,224
We want the crowd to be pumped up.

1197
01:16:29,984 --> 01:16:33,224
MAN.. Okay, all right.
They were really good, right?

1198
01:16:34,221 --> 01:16:37,051
Sharks, Jets, Shets.

1199
01:16:37,123 --> 01:16:39,353
It doesn't really matter what
you call yourselves.

1200
01:16:39,426 --> 01:16:43,226
Oh, and you call yourselves
the Flaming Hoes.

1201
01:16:43,297 --> 01:16:45,417
Yeah. That's a bad choice.

1202
01:16:45,499 --> 01:16:49,829
...introduce to you, the mighty
Flamingos.

1203
01:16:54,575 --> 01:16:57,935
Hope you've been practicing
your loser facials.

1204
01:16:58,012 --> 01:17:00,342
Oh, wait. I think you're on.

1205
01:17:00,681 --> 01:17:02,581
You are so on.

1206
01:17:02,683 --> 01:17:05,983
Shelby, come on!

1207
01:17:06,053 --> 01:17:07,153
Come on, you guys.

1208
01:17:07,220 --> 01:17:08,250
Let's go.

1209
01:17:17,330 --> 01:17:18,800
Flamingos, think pink!

1210
01:17:18,933 --> 01:17:20,423
Pink, pink, pink!

1211
01:17:54,501 --> 01:17:56,331
They're even better than I
remembered.

1212
01:17:56,404 --> 01:17:58,534
And they're not even cursed.

1213
01:17:59,006 --> 01:18:00,366
Carson.

1214
01:18:14,488 --> 01:18:16,748
Okay, you've got to get over
yourself and fast.

1215
01:18:16,823 --> 01:18:18,493
What? Stop psyching yourself out.

1216
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:19,580
Look, I'm totally fine.

1217
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:22,030
You're totally not, and they
know that you're scared.

1218
01:18:22,095 --> 01:18:23,495
Look, what else do you want me to say?

1219
01:18:23,565 --> 01:18:24,925
You've been right about me all along.

1220
01:18:24,998 --> 01:18:26,298
I'm not a good leader, my skills are...

1221
01:18:26,366 --> 01:18:28,296
You idiot. This is not about skills.

1222
01:18:28,369 --> 01:18:30,269
This competition is about
showmanship.

1223
01:18:30,337 --> 01:18:33,197
Your choreography is going to
win it for us.

1224
01:18:33,274 --> 01:18:36,804
Don't you know you're more
creative than me?

1225
01:18:36,877 --> 01:18:39,607
Why else would I bother to put you down?

1226
01:18:40,081 --> 01:18:43,921
Carson, you've got it. You always have.

1227
01:18:44,886 --> 01:18:47,676
But for the Shets' sake,
now you gotta bring it.

1228
01:18:47,755 --> 01:18:50,375
Hey, it's your year, remember?

1229
01:18:50,458 --> 01:18:52,858
No, Brooke, it's our year.

1230
01:19:16,684 --> 01:19:17,984
All right, you guys, this is it.

1231
01:19:18,053 --> 01:19:19,283
Just stay tight and lock out.

1232
01:19:19,353 --> 01:19:20,883
Okay. On three.

1233
01:19:22,056 --> 01:19:23,346
One, two, three.

1234
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:24,645
Shets!

1235
01:19:29,230 --> 01:19:31,490
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1236
01:19:32,099 --> 01:19:33,529
Yeah. Hey.

1237
01:19:38,606 --> 01:19:40,506
Yeah! Great job!

1238
01:19:42,042 --> 01:19:45,942
And now for our last performance
of the day,

1239
01:19:46,012 --> 01:19:51,582
from Camp Spirit Thunder,
rising from the ashes of both coasts,

1240
01:19:51,651 --> 01:19:54,491
here are the Shets!

1241
01:20:09,502 --> 01:20:12,032
Don't worry, skids, I checked
your marks.

1242
01:20:12,106 --> 01:20:13,596
Just catch me, okay.

1243
01:20:13,673 --> 01:20:14,803
Cradle.

1244
01:20:15,442 --> 01:20:16,932
All set, Penn.

1245
01:21:45,666 --> 01:21:46,786
Cradle.

1246
01:21:48,602 --> 01:21:50,502
Told you I'd catch you.

1247
01:24:01,734 --> 01:24:04,104
Yes, yes. Yes, yes!

1248
01:24:42,576 --> 01:24:43,906
We did it!

1249
01:24:50,550 --> 01:24:52,610
That's what I'm talking about.
Give me some.

1250
01:24:52,686 --> 01:24:54,306
Some what?

1251
01:24:54,387 --> 01:24:56,617
Okay. All right. Yeah!

1252
01:24:56,690 --> 01:25:00,850
As always, Cheer Camp Championships
deliver, huh? Let's hear you.

1253
01:25:00,927 --> 01:25:02,897
We'll have to wait for the
judges to score

1254
01:25:02,964 --> 01:25:04,864
because this one's going to be close.

1255
01:25:06,032 --> 01:25:07,762
Too close. Yeah.

1256
01:25:07,835 --> 01:25:09,855
Now is a really bad time to be cursed.

1257
01:25:10,937 --> 01:25:13,767
You know what? Who cares if we're cursed?

1258
01:25:13,841 --> 01:25:17,001
Getting cursed may have been the
best thing that's ever happened to us.

1259
01:25:17,076 --> 01:25:19,506
Without this curse, we would have
never become this team,

1260
01:25:19,580 --> 01:25:21,510
and hit a stunt that's never
been done before.

1261
01:25:21,582 --> 01:25:23,572
I mean, that was amazing.

1262
01:25:24,118 --> 01:25:26,848
I have the results right here.

1263
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:29,620
I'll be reading third place, apparently.

1264
01:25:29,690 --> 01:25:33,520
In third place, representing
South Dakota, the Prairie Dogs.

1265
01:25:34,561 --> 01:25:36,191
Way to go, Dogs.

1266
01:25:37,296 --> 01:25:39,886
Look, we all gave 100%,
and we trust each other.

1267
01:25:39,967 --> 01:25:43,227
Who cares about some stupid old
trophy and world tour?

1268
01:25:43,302 --> 01:25:46,572
Coming in at second place,

1269
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:48,630
the Flamingos!

1270
01:25:49,910 --> 01:25:50,930
Oh, my God!

1271
01:25:51,011 --> 01:25:53,641
All right. So that means the
winning squad

1272
01:25:53,714 --> 01:25:55,774
that will represent the United States

1273
01:25:55,916 --> 01:25:58,006
on a Cheer Exhibition World Tour

1274
01:25:58,085 --> 01:26:01,645
is the East-West Shets!

1275
01:26:03,457 --> 01:26:05,047
Brooke, I meant what I said. I know.

1276
01:26:05,125 --> 01:26:06,745
It's just... We freaking won!

1277
01:26:06,827 --> 01:26:07,847
I know.

1278
01:26:09,096 --> 01:26:11,356
Pepper, got something for you.

1279
01:26:11,431 --> 01:26:13,131
My spirit stick.

1280
01:26:13,201 --> 01:26:14,831
Vance, I knew it was you all along.

1281
01:26:14,901 --> 01:26:16,891
But why? You don't even believe in it.

1282
01:26:16,970 --> 01:26:18,100
No, but you do.

1283
01:26:18,372 --> 01:26:20,642
Besides, the stupid stick didn't
work in the first place.

1284
01:26:20,707 --> 01:26:22,467
Pepper. Maybe it did.

1285
01:26:22,543 --> 01:26:24,273
We broke the curse.

1286
01:26:25,345 --> 01:26:27,745
You sure did. Congratulations.

1287
01:26:27,814 --> 01:26:34,014
No more curse! No more curse!

1288
01:26:34,087 --> 01:26:35,917
No more curse!

1289
01:26:36,589 --> 01:26:37,779
Carson.
