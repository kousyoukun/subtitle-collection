1
00:00:30,866 --> 00:00:32,629
East Coast!West Coast!

2
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,427
East Coast!West Coast!

3
00:00:34,428 --> 00:00:36,123
East Coast!West Coast!

4
00:00:36,128 --> 00:00:37,891
East Coast!West Coast!

5
00:00:37,892 --> 00:00:39,223
East Coast!

6
00:00:39,946 --> 00:00:43,143
How does if feel to be the centerfold for losers?

7
00:00:43,924 --> 00:00:46,188
Not this year.Sharks all the way.

8
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,603
Yeah.

9
00:00:47,615 --> 00:00:49,879
Just because you shanks go all the way...

10
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,384
What?

11
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:54,298
...doesn't mean your team will.

12
00:00:58,619 --> 00:00:59,745
Boys.

13
00:01:02,502 --> 00:01:04,732
One, two, three, four.

14
00:01:04,715 --> 00:01:06,740
''J'' to the ''E'' to the ''T'' to the ''S''

15
00:01:06,737 --> 00:01:09,035
jets kick ass from east to west

16
00:01:09,015 --> 00:01:13,543
All you do is shake your butts Cheer 101 for stupid sluts

17
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:17,058
We're the West Coast Sharks And we got bite

18
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:19,402
We got what it takes to win this fight

19
00:01:19,378 --> 00:01:21,573
jets, you stiff,you dull, you old

20
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,721
Your moves and motions leave us cold

21
00:01:24,448 --> 00:01:28,976
Carson, captain of their team A loser even in her dreams

22
00:01:33,046 --> 00:01:35,310
You said it all,except one hitch

23
00:01:35,356 --> 00:01:37,620
She's a stuck-up, nasty,stupid little witch

24
00:01:37,602 --> 00:01:39,900
You girls think that you're ahead

25
00:01:39,944 --> 00:01:42,242
Our mascot's moves will knock you dead!

26
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:20,677
l am so psyched!

27
00:02:21,493 --> 00:02:24,428
No, really. This time it wasn't a nightmare.

28
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,088
Busted.

29
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,807
Damn! We're gonna have some fun.

30
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,923
Fun? We're not here to have fun, Ruben.We're here to win.

31
00:03:04,872 --> 00:03:07,705
Do you think East Coast is here to have fun?Hell, no! So, no fun.

32
00:03:07,663 --> 00:03:10,632
Okay. l won't use the ''F'' word anymore.

33
00:03:10,582 --> 00:03:13,551
Look, this year we're taking the title and going on the world tour.

34
00:03:13,503 --> 00:03:14,765
Hell to the yeah!

35
00:03:14,785 --> 00:03:17,083
Let's bust some East Coast attitude!

36
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:19,931
Reality check.The Jets have beat us three years in a row.

37
00:03:19,888 --> 00:03:21,446
What's your problem,doom cookie?

38
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,896
No problem. Let the disemboweling begin!

39
00:03:27,427 --> 00:03:28,860
Dibs on their entrails!

40
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:35,008
Cheer TV is live at the Hard Rock Hotel at Universal Orlando.

41
00:03:34,935 --> 00:03:37,563
And l'm here with Pepper Driscoll and Vance Voorhees,

42
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:40,001
owners of the two rival cheer camps.

43
00:03:39,972 --> 00:03:41,872
Pepper, can you tell us a little bit about

44
00:03:41,865 --> 00:03:43,730
the All Star Cheer Camp Championships?

45
00:03:43,726 --> 00:03:46,786
l'd love to. Well, this year is extra special,

46
00:03:46,742 --> 00:03:49,575
because the winning squad will represent our great nation

47
00:03:49,534 --> 00:03:51,399
on a Cheer Exhibition World Tour.

48
00:03:51,394 --> 00:03:52,588
That's right.

49
00:03:52,614 --> 00:03:55,640
And my teams will come in at least first and second place again.

50
00:03:56,656 --> 00:03:58,851
Pepper's camp has both champion squads

51
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:01,807
that epitomize the clash in American cheer styles.

52
00:04:02,304 --> 00:04:04,272
In fact, last year,one of her squads,

53
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,956
the East Coast jets,with their traditional cheer moves

54
00:04:07,116 --> 00:04:09,414
narrowly defeated the West Coast Sharks,

55
00:04:09,394 --> 00:04:11,328
another one of Pepper's squads shown here

56
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:13,184
with their new wave dance styling

57
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,705
inspired by music video choreography.

58
00:04:16,003 --> 00:04:18,164
ln the cheer world,the controversy is brewing over

59
00:04:18,153 --> 00:04:22,453
what exactly defines cheerleading,precision or flavor.

60
00:04:22,356 --> 00:04:23,914
Speaking of controversy,Vance,

61
00:04:23,928 --> 00:04:25,919
is the bad blood between your Camp Victory

62
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:27,885
and Pepper's Camp Spirit Thunder

63
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,274
related to your divorce?

64
00:04:30,313 --> 00:04:31,974
Of course not.We're both professionals,

65
00:04:31,982 --> 00:04:33,574
and we handle our craft seriously.

66
00:04:33,585 --> 00:04:34,882
Which is why l can say that, this year,

67
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:36,960
a Camp Victory team will vanquish all comers.

68
00:04:36,955 --> 00:04:39,389
By vanquish he means third again.

69
00:04:39,361 --> 00:04:42,296
No, this year Camp Victory has a secret weapon.

70
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:44,216
Bulltwinkle, you do not.

71
00:04:44,205 --> 00:04:46,537
We do, and l guess you're gonna have to wait and see.

72
00:04:46,516 --> 00:04:50,043
Well, we'll all see in this Saturday's World Cheer Exhibition

73
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,948
right here on Cheer TV.

74
00:05:13,371 --> 00:05:14,770
All right, after everybody unpacks,

75
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:16,147
we need to practice our home routine.

76
00:05:16,162 --> 00:05:17,356
We just got here.

77
00:05:17,381 --> 00:05:18,848
Yeah, and if we want to leave here winners,

78
00:05:18,856 --> 00:05:20,949
it's going to take practice, practice and more practice.

79
00:05:20,942 --> 00:05:22,068
And after that...

80
00:05:22,097 --> 00:05:23,291
Oh, my God. Carson.

81
00:05:23,316 --> 00:05:25,511
l'm, like, so glad you came back this year.

82
00:05:25,498 --> 00:05:27,625
Hey, Brooke,of course we came back.

83
00:05:27,615 --> 00:05:31,244
After losing to us three years in a row,it's, like, so brave.

84
00:05:31,177 --> 00:05:33,304
Yo! Can we burn this Least Coast trash?

85
00:05:33,294 --> 00:05:35,660
You know what?They're not even worth it, Aeysha.

86
00:05:35,637 --> 00:05:37,798
Give it up, Brooke.We're not gonna play like that.

87
00:05:37,787 --> 00:05:40,051
Oh, you mean like champions?

88
00:05:40,642 --> 00:05:42,940
Yeah. Not really your thing, huh?

89
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,854
Practice in 10 minutes!

90
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:45,834
Ta-ta.

91
00:05:45,903 --> 00:05:49,202
We're from the West Coast The mighty, mighty West Coast

92
00:05:49,145 --> 00:05:52,478
We ain't got no fear We're the best,it's our year!

93
00:05:52,417 --> 00:05:55,545
W-E-S-T,West Coast can't be beat!

94
00:05:55,497 --> 00:05:58,330
l think it's time for a little guerilla warfare.

95
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:01,053
Brooke, where are we gonna find gorillas?

96
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:03,275
Just follow my lead.

97
00:06:03,294 --> 00:06:05,694
All right, you guys,spread out. Give it flavor.

98
00:06:05,668 --> 00:06:07,533
Five, six, seven, eight.

99
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:11,192
One, two, four,five and six,seven and eight.

100
00:06:11,123 --> 00:06:14,752
One, two, and four,five and six, seven and eight.

101
00:06:14,683 --> 00:06:17,015
One and two...lgnore them!

102
00:06:16,994 --> 00:06:19,053
Six, seven, eight. Hey, girls.

103
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,172
Oh, hell, no.

104
00:06:20,202 --> 00:06:21,533
Oh, shit.

105
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,847
She's gonna go throw down.

106
00:06:23,988 --> 00:06:25,046
Yo, Paris Hilton.

107
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:27,070
lf you and this little purse dog of yours

108
00:06:27,068 --> 00:06:29,434
ever pull that skanky East Coast mess again,

109
00:06:29,411 --> 00:06:31,072
l will slice you like government cheese!

110
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:32,671
Aeysha, give it a rest.Give it a rest.

111
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,207
l swear to you l will...

112
00:06:34,223 --> 00:06:35,986
l didn't know the government made cheese.

113
00:06:35,988 --> 00:06:37,717
She better watch her back.

114
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,134
What?

115
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,592
You go, girl.

116
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,433
You know what?l need to rework that transition, anyway,

117
00:06:44,426 --> 00:06:47,122
so free time until opening ceremonies.

118
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:17,763
Whoa.

119
00:07:19,847 --> 00:07:21,314
Hey, are you okay?

120
00:07:21,323 --> 00:07:22,620
l'm fine.

121
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,732
You kind of got skid marks.

122
00:07:25,238 --> 00:07:28,401
Good. Now the police can track down the stroller.

123
00:07:28,606 --> 00:07:30,540
Hey, why do l feel like l've met you before?

124
00:07:30,531 --> 00:07:32,465
l don't know.Maybe in a prior life.

125
00:07:32,456 --> 00:07:36,222
Well, l was thinking this one, but now that sounds whack.

126
00:07:36,371 --> 00:07:37,770
So, where are you from?

127
00:07:37,783 --> 00:07:40,718
California. A place called Eden Hills. You?

128
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,297
Nowhere and everywhere.

129
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,031
You know,l'm an army brat.

130
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:45,666
l guess l'm just a regular brat.

131
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,367
l've never been out of the country.

132
00:07:47,376 --> 00:07:49,003
We just moved back from London.

133
00:07:49,012 --> 00:07:51,310
Really?We're going there soon.

134
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,258
Oh, you're gonna love England.

135
00:07:53,248 --> 00:07:55,011
You know me so well.Oh, no doubt.

136
00:07:55,012 --> 00:07:56,479
Because, you know,in our prior life,

137
00:07:56,488 --> 00:07:58,115
when we were guards at Buckingham Palace,

138
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,457
you were that hottie wearing that bearskin hat.

139
00:08:00,434 --> 00:08:02,334
Of course, all the guards were trying to hook up with you.

140
00:08:02,328 --> 00:08:03,818
Oh, right, let me guess.

141
00:08:03,835 --> 00:08:05,302
You defended my honor.

142
00:08:05,311 --> 00:08:07,836
No, l was trying to get at you, too.

143
00:08:08,103 --> 00:08:09,570
Hey, you ever done the Double-Dragon?

144
00:08:09,578 --> 00:08:11,011
What?

145
00:08:15,546 --> 00:08:17,844
Right. l got to go.

146
00:08:17,824 --> 00:08:19,314
Hey, hold up, skids.

147
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,129
What if l want to see you again?

148
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,230
Number?

149
00:08:26,262 --> 00:08:31,359
916-555-0198.

150
00:08:35,535 --> 00:08:38,060
Cool. Now, l got your number, skids.

151
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:39,369
lt's Carson.

152
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:40,682
lt's Penn.

153
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,884
lf you need help wiping that off...

154
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,754
Just so you know,l'm not mad anymore.

155
00:08:53,727 --> 00:08:56,093
l MySpaced it all out of my system.

156
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:59,334
Now, hurry up,or we're gonna be late for the opening ceremony.

157
00:08:59,277 --> 00:09:02,075
Why him? Why now?

158
00:09:02,037 --> 00:09:03,299
Why who?

159
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,447
Aeysha,l met this guy.

160
00:09:05,438 --> 00:09:08,100
What? l wasn't even sure you remember what guys were.

161
00:09:08,069 --> 00:09:09,661
His name is Penn and he's so...

162
00:09:09,672 --> 00:09:11,196
Carson, breathe.

163
00:09:11,597 --> 00:09:13,292
He's awesome and smart,but in a good way.

164
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:14,732
And he's hot,caliente hot.

165
00:09:14,742 --> 00:09:17,267
Aeysha, l want to lick his abs.

166
00:09:17,245 --> 00:09:18,371
But you didn't, right?

167
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,424
No!

168
00:09:19,811 --> 00:09:23,144
l need to stay focused,that means no cute boys.

169
00:09:23,565 --> 00:09:26,125
Right now,beating the Jets is my top priority.

170
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,158
And you're doing the right thing.

171
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,214
l know.

172
00:09:28,249 --> 00:09:29,944
So, can l have him?

173
00:09:35,694 --> 00:09:37,025
Ooh, Penn looks hot.

174
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,167
Just don't.

175
00:09:42,334 --> 00:09:43,494
What do you mean?

176
00:09:43,522 --> 00:09:45,149
l like your hair that way, Chelsea.

177
00:09:45,158 --> 00:09:46,284
Oh, it's this new gel.

178
00:09:46,313 --> 00:09:48,838
My hair always looks better when there's something sticky in it.

179
00:09:50,484 --> 00:09:52,349
All right.Who is she?

180
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:53,914
What?

181
00:09:53,949 --> 00:09:55,576
The girl who's making you stupid.

182
00:09:55,746 --> 00:09:57,509
All right.Check it out.l met her today

183
00:09:57,511 --> 00:09:59,240
when l was running.Her name's...

184
00:09:59,243 --> 00:10:00,267
Carson!Carson!

185
00:10:00,302 --> 00:10:01,929
Right.Wrong.

186
00:10:01,938 --> 00:10:03,064
She's a Shark.

187
00:10:03,094 --> 00:10:04,186
She's the frigging captain of the Sharks.

188
00:10:04,217 --> 00:10:05,514
And what did she say?What did she want?

189
00:10:05,532 --> 00:10:06,760
Did she ask about our routines?

190
00:10:06,783 --> 00:10:08,011
Yeah, right.

191
00:10:08,034 --> 00:10:09,797
Cheering was the last thing we talked about.

192
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:11,699
Penn, she's like your sworn emeny.

193
00:10:11,692 --> 00:10:13,182
l swear it.

194
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:15,844
Trust me.She's not my enemy.

195
00:10:23,082 --> 00:10:25,141
Penn, you need to know.

196
00:10:25,136 --> 00:10:27,536
Carson's a two-faced,back-biting,man-eating Shark!

197
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,501
Yeah. And guys hate biters.

198
00:10:29,498 --> 00:10:30,760
Why are you guys busting on me?

199
00:10:30,782 --> 00:10:32,249
Because you don't get it.

200
00:10:32,258 --> 00:10:34,624
Yeah. l think l do.

201
00:10:37,263 --> 00:10:39,390
Don't flatter yourself, Penn.

202
00:10:39,381 --> 00:10:41,781
This is about our team,about winning.

203
00:10:41,756 --> 00:10:43,053
So now what, Captain?

204
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,868
Are you gonna forbid me from seeing Carson?

205
00:10:44,867 --> 00:10:45,959
l would never do that.

206
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,288
Good, 'cause it wouldn't work.

207
00:10:53,498 --> 00:10:55,625
He can't date a Shark!

208
00:10:55,616 --> 00:10:59,211
Duh, Chelsea.Watch and learn.

209
00:11:05,979 --> 00:11:09,176
Thank you.Thank you.Thank you.

210
00:11:09,123 --> 00:11:10,283
Hi, everybody.

211
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,437
Welcome to Camp Spirit Thunder.

212
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,424
This year,we're so proud to welcome

213
00:11:18,395 --> 00:11:20,761
a new member to our family, okay.

214
00:11:20,738 --> 00:11:22,228
l heard she's really tough.

215
00:11:22,246 --> 00:11:26,580
Give a big Spirit welcome to our new choreographer,Chicago.

216
00:11:26,481 --> 00:11:28,346
Come on up here, girl.

217
00:11:32,982 --> 00:11:35,041
All right, all eyes on me.

218
00:11:35,036 --> 00:11:37,470
Now, I want you all to remember this gorgeous face,

219
00:11:37,442 --> 00:11:39,808
'cause it will haunt you in your sleep.

220
00:11:39,785 --> 00:11:41,446
Now, I believe in hard work.

221
00:11:41,453 --> 00:11:43,045
Winning knows no pain.

222
00:11:43,058 --> 00:11:46,323
So, when I say jump,I wanna hear, ''How high?''

223
00:11:46,266 --> 00:11:47,426
Now jump.

224
00:11:47,453 --> 00:11:48,579
How high?

225
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,098
That's what I'm talking about.

226
00:11:50,116 --> 00:11:51,549
Don't hate the player, baby.

227
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,611
Okay, seriously,Cheerzilla is a little scary.

228
00:11:55,859 --> 00:11:58,350
What? l love her.

229
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:01,561
She's the kind of black woman gay men emulate.She's amazing.

230
00:12:01,506 --> 00:12:07,445
Welcome your cheer-tastic 2008 Spirit Thunder instructors!

231
00:12:11,966 --> 00:12:13,661
Come on, guys.

232
00:12:19,121 --> 00:12:20,520
That was really great.

233
00:12:49,761 --> 00:12:51,922
Yeah! Aren't they terrific?

234
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,624
Aren't they wonderful?

235
00:12:55,311 --> 00:12:56,801
Yeah!

236
00:12:57,558 --> 00:12:58,786
All right.

237
00:12:58,809 --> 00:13:04,577
And now, as you know,we have a very special tradition here

238
00:13:04,423 --> 00:13:07,358
at Camp Spirit Thunder.

239
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:12,690
This spirit stick was given to me

240
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,298
by the father of cheerleading himself,

241
00:13:15,268 --> 00:13:16,997
Herkie Herkimer.

242
00:13:17,001 --> 00:13:20,994
It embodies the heart and the soul of cheerleading,

243
00:13:20,915 --> 00:13:24,316
and it brings the luck of the cheer spirits.

244
00:13:24,252 --> 00:13:27,688
So, each team will be able to experience

245
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:31,021
its powerful aura for one night.

246
00:13:34,102 --> 00:13:35,126
That's right.

247
00:13:35,161 --> 00:13:40,155
And last year's winners of the Championships will have the honors first,

248
00:13:40,037 --> 00:13:41,834
the East Coast jets.

249
00:13:46,615 --> 00:13:48,048
Go get it.What?

250
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:49,924
Come on.You do it. Go.What?

251
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:51,409
just a warning.

252
00:13:51,428 --> 00:13:56,263
Lose the stick and you will face the wrath of the cheer gods.

253
00:13:56,143 --> 00:14:00,409
I once knew a cheerleader who misplaced the stick for just one day

254
00:14:00,315 --> 00:14:02,044
and she broke her leg doing a simple toe touch.

255
00:14:02,048 --> 00:14:03,310
Wait for it.

256
00:14:03,331 --> 00:14:04,593
So guard it with your lives, people.

257
00:14:04,614 --> 00:14:05,808
Wait for it.

258
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:09,166
You will find good fortune while it's in your possession, jets.

259
00:14:14,496 --> 00:14:16,088
Cheer smackdown.

260
00:14:16,935 --> 00:14:18,630
Words, shorty.Use your words.

261
00:14:18,635 --> 00:14:19,727
Him.

262
00:14:19,983 --> 00:14:21,541
Abs Penn.

263
00:14:22,357 --> 00:14:23,415
Go jets.

264
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:25,438
Oh, girl.You know a cheer Crip

265
00:14:25,437 --> 00:14:27,405
can't be hitting it with a cheer Blood.

266
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:33,202
All right. Everybody have a fun and safe week here at Camp Spirit Thunder!

267
00:14:37,661 --> 00:14:39,026
You're a Jet?

268
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,099
Yeah, that's a trip, huh?

269
00:14:40,132 --> 00:14:41,121
Why didn't you tell me?

270
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:43,627
What, that l was a male cheerleader?

271
00:14:43,597 --> 00:14:45,895
Sure. That's a real panty-dropper!

272
00:14:46,741 --> 00:14:48,038
Look, l didn't mean any...

273
00:14:48,057 --> 00:14:49,684
Did Brooke tell you to play me?

274
00:14:49,693 --> 00:14:51,456
Sucks to be you, huh?

275
00:14:52,068 --> 00:14:53,899
Carson, l didn't know you were a cheerleader.

276
00:14:53,896 --> 00:14:55,454
Like...And what's the big deal?

277
00:14:55,468 --> 00:14:56,992
l'm a Jet. So what?

278
00:14:57,008 --> 00:14:58,100
So what?

279
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:01,191
l cannot have an inter-cheeracial relationship!

280
00:15:03,585 --> 00:15:04,643
Hello?

281
00:15:04,677 --> 00:15:05,769
Greetings,Camp Spirit Thunder.

282
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:07,994
just a friendly video postcard from Camp Victory.

283
00:15:07,981 --> 00:15:10,609
Looking very forward to seeing you in the Championships.

284
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,445
We've got a secret weapon this year.

285
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,704
Say, Pepper, how many of your kids can throw

286
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:17,850
a roundoff, back handspring double-fold twist?

287
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:19,027
Oh, none?

288
00:15:20,173 --> 00:15:22,107
Meet the new and improved Flamingos.

289
00:15:22,099 --> 00:15:23,964
See you at the...

290
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:25,392
The Flamingos?

291
00:15:25,403 --> 00:15:27,030
They can barely stand on one leg.

292
00:15:28,547 --> 00:15:31,243
Everybody,it is all right.

293
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:35,510
Vance Voorhees is just trying to psyche us out.Okay?

294
00:15:35,413 --> 00:15:38,541
And it didn't work last year, and it's not gonna work this year.

295
00:15:38,493 --> 00:15:40,256
We always win.

296
00:15:40,322 --> 00:15:42,119
Nothing's gonna stop us this week.

297
00:15:42,119 --> 00:15:44,178
Except the Sharks.

298
00:15:44,172 --> 00:15:46,436
Your little trick's not gonna work, Brooke.

299
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:48,387
Making sure l knew Penn was a Jet

300
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,275
makes it that much easier to resist him.

301
00:15:51,488 --> 00:15:53,683
l'm no player,but l thought l had a little game.

302
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:56,605
Sorry, Penn,but l've only got one thing on my mind,

303
00:15:56,557 --> 00:15:58,923
and that is crushing your squad.

304
00:16:00,183 --> 00:16:02,515
Not even in your dreams, Carson.

305
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:05,257
We're done here.Let's go.

306
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:15,468
Hey, can you go on spiritaccessories.com

307
00:16:15,455 --> 00:16:18,515
and see if they have the key chains that light up?

308
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,506
lf pink is the new black,what's the new pink?

309
00:16:23,444 --> 00:16:25,776
Aeysha, l'm trying to work here.

310
00:16:26,588 --> 00:16:29,955
l have to find a killer stunt that'll knock East Coast on their spanks.

311
00:16:29,893 --> 00:16:31,087
Sorry.

312
00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:33,923
lt doesn't matter.

313
00:16:33,936 --> 00:16:35,494
l can't concentrate anyway.

314
00:16:40,224 --> 00:16:44,126
Hey, you need to get serious, 'cause l don't care how cute he is,

315
00:16:44,042 --> 00:16:46,135
we are here to win, right?

316
00:16:46,128 --> 00:16:47,823
True that, sister, yo.

317
00:16:48,727 --> 00:16:52,060
Girl, go to sleep.Tomorrow is gonna be fun.

318
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,614
Five, six, seven, eight.

319
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:08,100
Come on.My granny can jump higher than that from her grave.

320
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,441
...seven, eight, one.

321
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,316
Okay, Sarah,you're up.

322
00:17:12,308 --> 00:17:14,139
Let's have a little spirit this time.

323
00:17:14,747 --> 00:17:18,808
1st and 10,do it again. Go, go

324
00:17:18,726 --> 00:17:20,421
All right, Ruben,you're up.

325
00:17:20,426 --> 00:17:25,830
P-E-A-C-E.Peace to the Middle East Go, planet!

326
00:17:25,688 --> 00:17:27,155
He can't do that,can he?

327
00:17:27,164 --> 00:17:30,565
l mean, if he cheers for peace, then the terrorists win! Duh!

328
00:17:40,286 --> 00:17:43,312
Showmanship.

329
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,261
That's what sells the performance.

330
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,957
So, I want everyone to give me big facials.

331
00:17:48,885 --> 00:17:50,785
Because you have to remember

332
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:55,272
that points will be deducted for bad facials, okay?

333
00:17:58,447 --> 00:17:59,937
All right. All right,you guys, now.

334
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,354
Any of those dance moves can be used in a cheer routine.

335
00:18:02,328 --> 00:18:04,319
Since when is dance a part of cheerleading,anyway?

336
00:18:04,318 --> 00:18:07,981
Since the world first started recognizing that cheerleading was real.

337
00:18:07,911 --> 00:18:09,503
I mean, think about it, you guys.

338
00:18:09,515 --> 00:18:11,073
If you've got some dope cheerleading,

339
00:18:11,087 --> 00:18:12,486
you're throwing some hot dance moves

340
00:18:12,499 --> 00:18:13,830
and you got some crazy tumbling.

341
00:18:13,847 --> 00:18:15,075
What do you have?

342
00:18:15,098 --> 00:18:16,258
You got a triple threat, right?

343
00:18:16,285 --> 00:18:18,617
Triple threat right here.

344
00:18:18,595 --> 00:18:19,857
Yo, I got this.

345
00:18:19,878 --> 00:18:21,573
Okay. Okay.Bring it, boo.

346
00:18:32,455 --> 00:18:34,480
Ain't like they can hang when a sister

347
00:18:34,477 --> 00:18:37,139
gets to cracking and popping her collarbone.

348
00:18:37,108 --> 00:18:38,575
You smell me?

349
00:18:39,226 --> 00:18:41,387
What the hell are you doing?

350
00:18:42,563 --> 00:18:44,394
l'm keeping it real,sister.

351
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:45,858
Keeping it real for who?

352
00:18:45,867 --> 00:18:48,358
You need to just be you, okay, boo?Just be you.

353
00:18:52,669 --> 00:18:54,159
I love it when we win

354
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:57,009
The only thing that's better is when it's twice as long

355
00:18:56,968 --> 00:18:59,095
And I get a double-header

356
00:18:59,856 --> 00:19:01,221
Your cart.

357
00:19:05,246 --> 00:19:09,012
First of all, we're gonna start with happy,happy, happy.

358
00:19:08,936 --> 00:19:11,166
We're so happy to be here. Good.

359
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:12,241
All right, now,surprise.

360
00:19:13,364 --> 00:19:16,891
What just happened?l don't know but it was wonderful.

361
00:19:16,828 --> 00:19:20,958
Uh-oh! Here comes the big wink for you in the back, judge.

362
00:19:20,871 --> 00:19:23,305
Big wink.There we go.

363
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:29,879
Come on, girl. Sunshine,I have seen better facials at a funeral

364
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:32,421
and l'm talking about the corpses.

365
00:19:32,389 --> 00:19:34,050
Oh, we like that,do we?

366
00:19:34,058 --> 00:19:35,320
Well, let's just make that smile...

367
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,368
Oh, gosh.Okay, all right.

368
00:19:38,357 --> 00:19:40,848
Well, the workshop is over.

369
00:19:51,383 --> 00:19:53,510
Do just one facial.Come on.

370
00:19:54,175 --> 00:19:57,042
lf you hate cheerleading so much,why do you do it?

371
00:19:56,998 --> 00:19:58,590
For Satan.

372
00:19:58,603 --> 00:20:01,538
That's a shiny nugget I did not need to know.

373
00:20:01,811 --> 00:20:03,369
It's just like yoga, you know.

374
00:20:03,383 --> 00:20:04,873
It is.

375
00:20:08,389 --> 00:20:09,981
Satan is my car.

376
00:20:10,506 --> 00:20:14,636
My parents promised me payments and insurance if I join the squad.

377
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:18,246
Well, my parents promised me a car if l stop cheerleading.

378
00:20:18,174 --> 00:20:21,837
And if I nail a girl, I get my own apartment.

379
00:20:21,767 --> 00:20:23,257
See, that was almost a facial.

380
00:20:23,276 --> 00:20:25,506
Yeah, in Transylvania.

381
00:20:25,489 --> 00:20:26,717
Step off, Brooke.

382
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,708
Who are you?Her fairy Goth-mother?

383
00:20:28,698 --> 00:20:32,327
Brooke, get over yourself,and stop sweating my team.

384
00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:34,489
Why would anyone listen to you?

385
00:20:34,473 --> 00:20:37,271
You suck as a gymnast and a captain, too.

386
00:20:37,746 --> 00:20:39,680
Cheer-off. Sharks!

387
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:40,729
Yeah.

388
00:20:40,761 --> 00:20:42,752
Five, six, seven, eight.

389
00:20:42,751 --> 00:20:45,151
It don't matter what we do

390
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,423
Music, baby, is our cue

391
00:20:47,403 --> 00:20:49,667
Hands and shoulders,face so tight

392
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:51,742
All our moves will rock this fight

393
00:20:51,735 --> 00:20:54,704
Our moves are tight,we lift with ease

394
00:20:54,654 --> 00:20:57,521
The things we do will make you wheeze

395
00:20:57,478 --> 00:21:00,208
So watch us strike our muscle pose

396
00:21:00,172 --> 00:21:02,697
While you all prance and dosey-doe

397
00:21:02,675 --> 00:21:04,768
That was cute,your pose was dull

398
00:21:04,761 --> 00:21:07,195
But all of you have belly rolls

399
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:09,362
Once again we groove with flare

400
00:21:09,349 --> 00:21:11,476
The moves we do,you wouldn't dare

401
00:21:11,466 --> 00:21:13,696
So listen quick while your face gets cracked

402
00:21:13,681 --> 00:21:15,444
One, two, three, you're wack

403
00:21:15,445 --> 00:21:17,470
Your rhymes are fun, but we're still good

404
00:21:17,466 --> 00:21:19,627
We still can stunt,you're from the hood

405
00:21:19,616 --> 00:21:21,948
Hood rats, good rats,what are you called?

406
00:21:21,926 --> 00:21:24,417
The moves you do won't win at all

407
00:21:24,396 --> 00:21:26,489
So listen quick, oops

408
00:21:26,482 --> 00:21:29,542
You said that rhyme One, two, three, our time

409
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:32,261
Motions, motions,hear them roar

410
00:21:32,225 --> 00:21:34,921
No one's knocking at your door

411
00:21:34,888 --> 00:21:37,049
With no rhythm and with no sass

412
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:39,097
All of you can kiss our ass

413
00:21:39,091 --> 00:21:41,286
Dance, 10, looks, 3

414
00:21:41,273 --> 00:21:43,764
The moves you do make us all pee

415
00:21:43,743 --> 00:21:46,439
We laugh, we cry,we all say hi

416
00:21:46,407 --> 00:21:49,069
'Cause when you dance,it's bye, bye, bye

417
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:50,471
Bye, bye

418
00:21:50,481 --> 00:21:51,470
Bye.

419
00:21:51,508 --> 00:21:52,566
Bye. Have fun.

420
00:22:01,807 --> 00:22:03,138
Bye.

421
00:22:05,721 --> 00:22:07,780
Yo, that was shady,Brooke.

422
00:22:07,775 --> 00:22:09,970
Please, you totally popped a chubber.

423
00:22:09,957 --> 00:22:10,981
Hey, Brooke.

424
00:22:11,015 --> 00:22:12,004
What?

425
00:22:12,042 --> 00:22:14,101
You've got no clue,you're in the dark

426
00:22:14,095 --> 00:22:15,494
Wake up call,it's the year of the...

427
00:22:34,565 --> 00:22:35,998
Come on, babycakes.

428
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:39,912
If we all just imagine this world's a fabulous place, it'll happen.

429
00:22:41,142 --> 00:22:46,205
I see children frolicking under a rainbow eating hormone-free treats.

430
00:22:47,527 --> 00:22:49,222
A unicorn.

431
00:22:50,511 --> 00:22:56,472
l see mutant turtles gnawing on festering human flesh.

432
00:22:57,602 --> 00:22:58,591
da

433
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:00,909
They ate the unicorn.

434
00:23:02,863 --> 00:23:05,388
You need Jesus.Or Prozac.

435
00:23:06,907 --> 00:23:09,307
Thanks for trying to cheer me up, Ruben,

436
00:23:09,345 --> 00:23:11,745
but I'm more mad at myself than Brooke.

437
00:23:12,296 --> 00:23:13,957
I let her get to me.

438
00:23:13,965 --> 00:23:15,694
That's why we lost the cheer-off.

439
00:23:15,698 --> 00:23:17,723
Yeah, that bites.

440
00:23:17,783 --> 00:23:19,808
You gonna finish that steak?

441
00:23:33,505 --> 00:23:36,269
Spirit to you.

442
00:23:37,836 --> 00:23:40,896
Hey, l heard you had kind of a rough day, huh?

443
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:43,286
But your luck's about to change.

444
00:23:43,258 --> 00:23:45,055
Okay. All right.

445
00:23:45,055 --> 00:23:48,081
Oh, West Coast Sharks,may the luck of Herkie

446
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:51,008
smile on you as it has for me.

447
00:23:51,183 --> 00:23:52,673
Go Sharks

448
00:23:53,205 --> 00:23:54,729
Go Sharks

449
00:23:55,258 --> 00:23:56,725
Go Sharks

450
00:23:57,439 --> 00:23:58,997
Go Sharks

451
00:23:59,493 --> 00:24:01,120
Go Sharks

452
00:24:01,642 --> 00:24:03,132
Go Sharks

453
00:24:03,824 --> 00:24:05,314
Go Sharks

454
00:24:05,846 --> 00:24:06,904
Go Sharks

455
00:24:10,498 --> 00:24:13,626
Okay, guys, we got to give props to the spirits,

456
00:24:13,706 --> 00:24:15,401
but isn't this a little extreme?

457
00:24:15,406 --> 00:24:17,966
You know how nasty some cheerleaders can be when they're alive.

458
00:24:17,941 --> 00:24:20,136
Do you really want to risk the dead ones hating on you?

459
00:24:20,123 --> 00:24:23,217
Then let's do this right.Look, off.

460
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:30,725
Fire, water, earth,air, spirit stick.

461
00:24:31,673 --> 00:24:34,369
You know what this really needs to pop?

462
00:24:35,588 --> 00:24:37,453
The blood of a virgin.

463
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,561
Okay. Why are you guys looking at me?

464
00:24:43,577 --> 00:24:46,478
Come on, Carson, just a little pin prick.

465
00:24:46,433 --> 00:24:49,994
lf she can take a little prick, she wouldn't be a virgin.

466
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,434
You coming?

467
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:54,585
Hell to the yeah.

468
00:24:54,615 --> 00:24:55,741
Where?

469
00:24:55,769 --> 00:24:57,566
You wouldn't be into it.

470
00:24:57,566 --> 00:24:59,625
Cheer poker with the Prairie Dogs.

471
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,315
What's the buy-in?

472
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,117
Sarah, this is cheer poker.

473
00:25:03,117 --> 00:25:05,551
Sounds like easy pickings. Wait.

474
00:25:05,523 --> 00:25:07,548
Who's gonna guard the spirit stick?

475
00:25:09,855 --> 00:25:11,982
You know what? You guys go.

476
00:25:11,972 --> 00:25:14,440
l'm captain, l'll do stick duty.

477
00:25:14,411 --> 00:25:15,639
Thanks.Thanks, boo.

478
00:25:15,662 --> 00:25:17,027
What room is the poker game?

479
00:25:17,041 --> 00:25:19,032
Dumpy Dogs have a suite.

480
00:25:50,634 --> 00:25:51,862
Why can't I delete you?

481
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,245
Down here.

482
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:07,477
Penn, what are you doing?

483
00:26:07,511 --> 00:26:08,910
Well, you don't answer my calls and texts,

484
00:26:08,922 --> 00:26:12,187
so l had to do it old school and show up in person.

485
00:26:12,547 --> 00:26:13,946
Don't make me serenade you.

486
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:15,654
Penn, you're a Jet. We can't...

487
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:18,390
I know. I know. Look,let's just do the rides.

488
00:26:18,355 --> 00:26:21,017
No cheer talk.I promise.

489
00:26:20,986 --> 00:26:22,214
The Double-Dragon?

490
00:26:22,237 --> 00:26:24,467
Now you're talking.I'll meet you.

491
00:26:25,221 --> 00:26:26,518
Cradle.

492
00:26:49,605 --> 00:26:51,129
That was sick!

493
00:26:51,787 --> 00:26:52,947
You had fun,didn't you?

494
00:26:52,974 --> 00:26:54,908
Hey! l know how to play, bro.

495
00:26:54,899 --> 00:26:55,957
Mmm-hmm.

496
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:59,153
What? l take cheering seriously.

497
00:26:59,102 --> 00:27:00,899
You know,my team's counting on me.

498
00:27:00,962 --> 00:27:02,793
l'm not gonna let them down.

499
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:06,318
Word on the street? It's just summer camp.

500
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:08,054
Yeah, maybe for you.

501
00:27:08,054 --> 00:27:09,885
We worked our butts off just to get here.

502
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:11,714
So did we.

503
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:14,269
And we had to raise a lot of money.

504
00:27:14,246 --> 00:27:17,010
You know, wet T-shirt car washes.

505
00:27:17,423 --> 00:27:19,550
Trust me. l know.

506
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:22,998
Anyways, winning a competition like this,

507
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:25,910
it could really up my chance of getting a scholarship to college.

508
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,124
l even had to get a team scholarship just to get here.

509
00:27:28,107 --> 00:27:29,904
Yeah, so did l.

510
00:27:29,903 --> 00:27:32,394
You know, it's nothing to be ashamed of.

511
00:27:32,373 --> 00:27:33,670
In my case, it is.

512
00:27:33,689 --> 00:27:34,883
What do you mean?

513
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:38,646
Look, don't get all serious on me, skids.

514
00:27:38,662 --> 00:27:40,152
Come on.

515
00:27:43,635 --> 00:27:46,263
You fumbled on the flop We'll trick you on the turn

516
00:27:46,234 --> 00:27:49,067
Now here comes the river and the P-Dog burn!

517
00:27:49,026 --> 00:27:52,427
You Dogs think you can fool us Sharks at poker faces.

518
00:27:53,742 --> 00:27:56,575
You are so bluffing,Prairie Dog. I call.

519
00:27:56,534 --> 00:27:58,866
Trip cowboys.I beat that.

520
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,869
How about my three bullets shoot down your cowboys?

521
00:28:01,827 --> 00:28:03,351
P-Dogs rule!

522
00:28:03,368 --> 00:28:06,098
Oh, yeah? How about a Texas titty twister on the house?

523
00:28:06,062 --> 00:28:08,895
Hey, what are you doing? Oh, no, what the...

524
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,014
Go, go. Oh, no, we got them.

525
00:28:11,003 --> 00:28:12,368
We got his shorts.

526
00:28:14,982 --> 00:28:16,108
Look, shark.

527
00:28:18,543 --> 00:28:20,306
A world tour is no big deal to me.

528
00:28:20,308 --> 00:28:22,299
l've been overseas my whole life.

529
00:28:22,297 --> 00:28:25,664
Well, if you win again, you can get a cheer scholarship, too.

530
00:28:25,602 --> 00:28:27,160
To West Point?

531
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:30,009
Okay, wait, why would you go there?

532
00:28:30,062 --> 00:28:32,053
You're a musician and a dancer.

533
00:28:33,238 --> 00:28:36,765
Yeah, well, my father is a son of immigrants,

534
00:28:36,703 --> 00:28:38,796
and they came from nothing.

535
00:28:38,788 --> 00:28:40,380
And after he made a career out of the military,

536
00:28:40,393 --> 00:28:41,826
he had everything.

537
00:28:41,836 --> 00:28:44,430
So, all his sons went to West Point.

538
00:28:44,404 --> 00:28:47,532
There's five of us, and well, I'm the last one.

539
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:51,478
So, my parents, well, my father expects it.

540
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:53,025
Well, can't you talk to him?

541
00:28:53,034 --> 00:28:56,026
I mean, won't he let you cheer somewhere else?

542
00:28:57,366 --> 00:28:59,231
Wait. He doesn't know?

543
00:28:59,579 --> 00:29:01,604
My dad would spew a colon.

544
00:29:02,146 --> 00:29:05,206
I kind of told him I joined the tae kwon do team.

545
00:29:06,638 --> 00:29:09,630
Can l tell you a secret,but just between us?

546
00:29:09,589 --> 00:29:10,715
Sure.

547
00:29:20,018 --> 00:29:21,417
What?

548
00:29:22,263 --> 00:29:25,960
Even though my family has money, I took a team scholarship

549
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:30,258
because I didn't want him to find out about Cheer Camp.

550
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:34,057
Wow. Well, does your team know?

551
00:29:37,407 --> 00:29:38,897
Weak, huh?

552
00:29:40,263 --> 00:29:43,232
So, where does your dad think you are now?

553
00:29:43,182 --> 00:29:45,207
Extreme Warrior Martial Arts Camp.

554
00:29:45,268 --> 00:29:47,202
He watched me pack my nunchuks.

555
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:04,474
Whoa, you sharks do stick together.

556
00:30:10,999 --> 00:30:12,864
Yeah, get it, get it.

557
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,411
Move it. Come on, honey.

558
00:30:27,876 --> 00:30:29,571
Oh, go get Carson.

559
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:31,442
Honey, that girl can wear a thong.

560
00:30:31,437 --> 00:30:33,098
Yeah, my girl needs to learn to hang.

561
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,831
But we need to take this show to my crib.

562
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:36,466
She's guarding the stick there.

563
00:30:36,474 --> 00:30:38,965
Come on, you all, let's go. Let's go.

564
00:30:48,121 --> 00:30:49,952
Yo, Carson dipped out.

565
00:30:50,303 --> 00:30:52,032
And took the stick.

566
00:30:52,421 --> 00:30:53,649
Where?

567
00:30:54,474 --> 00:30:55,907
Maybe my girl learned to hang.

568
00:30:55,918 --> 00:30:57,886
Come on, let's go find her.

569
00:31:02,174 --> 00:31:04,836
You know, I should really get going.

570
00:31:04,805 --> 00:31:06,500
I just told you my darkest secret.

571
00:31:06,506 --> 00:31:08,406
Yeah, l know, but...

572
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:12,926
Look, when was the last time you just danced for fun?

573
00:31:12,826 --> 00:31:15,818
Without being thrown in the air every few seconds?

574
00:31:16,741 --> 00:31:18,800
A bar mitzvah three years ago.

575
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,238
So, Jet boy thinks he can handle West Coast moves?

576
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,794
l think Shark girl's asking the wrong question.

577
00:32:23,252 --> 00:32:24,685
No, Carson wouldn't bring it here.

578
00:32:24,695 --> 00:32:25,992
Too many haters.

579
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:27,911
Where else can we look?

580
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,890
I think I have an idea.

581
00:32:32,428 --> 00:32:33,895
Carson!

582
00:32:55,914 --> 00:32:56,938
Oh, no.

583
00:32:56,973 --> 00:32:57,962
What?

584
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,900
I'm about to have a secret, too.

585
00:32:59,892 --> 00:33:01,223
Carson!

586
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:03,501
What are you guys doing here?

587
00:33:03,518 --> 00:33:06,043
Us? You need to check yourself.

588
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,578
We were just hanging out.

589
00:33:07,592 --> 00:33:09,992
Carson, give us back the spirit stick.

590
00:33:09,967 --> 00:33:12,765
You junk up its karma around here with all these civilians.

591
00:33:12,726 --> 00:33:13,988
Ruben, it's in our room.

592
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:15,204
No, it's not.

593
00:33:15,229 --> 00:33:18,323
Why do you think we're out here looking for you?

594
00:33:18,501 --> 00:33:21,868
Somebody jacked it, and now we know for sure who.

595
00:33:21,806 --> 00:33:23,103
Jets!

596
00:33:25,271 --> 00:33:27,296
jets kick ass from east to west

597
00:33:27,293 --> 00:33:29,591
And speaking of coincidence...

598
00:33:29,571 --> 00:33:31,436
You lost the spirit stick.

599
00:33:31,432 --> 00:33:33,593
Ooh! You Sharks are tuna.

600
00:33:33,581 --> 00:33:34,775
Just give it back.

601
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,860
Carson, this isn't a Jets prank.

602
00:33:37,816 --> 00:33:39,283
l wouldn't scam you like this.

603
00:33:39,292 --> 00:33:41,226
Come on, Carson, it's just a big coincidence

604
00:33:41,217 --> 00:33:43,082
how he got you out of your room

605
00:33:43,078 --> 00:33:44,568
and then the spirit stick was stolen.

606
00:33:44,586 --> 00:33:48,147
Seems wrong he didn't tell you he was a Jet when he met you.

607
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:50,017
That's right. This has cheer bitch's

608
00:33:50,008 --> 00:33:51,908
skanky paw prints all over it!

609
00:33:51,902 --> 00:33:53,460
Don't let them play us again, Carson.

610
00:33:53,474 --> 00:33:54,998
It's our year, remember?

611
00:33:55,013 --> 00:33:56,571
This is so whack.Look, Carson.

612
00:33:56,585 --> 00:33:58,576
l'll help you look for the stupid stick, all right?

613
00:33:58,575 --> 00:33:59,906
What?Stupid stick?

614
00:33:59,922 --> 00:34:02,186
Yeah. l'll help you look, too.

615
00:34:03,003 --> 00:34:04,493
Look, don't get all crazy about this, okay?

616
00:34:04,511 --> 00:34:05,978
No, it's not okay.

617
00:34:05,987 --> 00:34:08,217
How can l trust someone who lies to his own team?

618
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,224
Carson.

619
00:34:09,259 --> 00:34:10,453
You know, he didn't need you guys

620
00:34:10,478 --> 00:34:12,173
to raise travel money for the trip.

621
00:34:12,178 --> 00:34:15,306
He was too scared to tell his dad about Cheer Camp.

622
00:34:15,259 --> 00:34:17,318
She's a liar,right, Penn?

623
00:34:20,168 --> 00:34:22,261
No, Brooke. l should have just believed you

624
00:34:22,254 --> 00:34:25,655
when you said Sharks and Jets were sworn enemies.

625
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,353
Now l know why.

626
00:34:27,386 --> 00:34:29,854
You showed your true colors, didn't you?

627
00:34:29,825 --> 00:34:32,259
And you showed you're just a Jet.

628
00:34:34,285 --> 00:34:36,549
Have fun being cursed, losers.

629
00:34:39,097 --> 00:34:41,725
Hey, we sold candy bars for you, dude.

630
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,760
l'll pay you back the money, okay?

631
00:34:47,568 --> 00:34:50,093
But those Butterfingers were heavy.

632
00:34:53,728 --> 00:34:54,888
Hey, Pepper.

633
00:34:54,915 --> 00:34:56,610
Heard the Sharks totally lost the spirit stick.

634
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,669
What?

635
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:02,581
Yeah, they're over there.

636
00:35:02,616 --> 00:35:03,708
Thank you. Thank you so much.

637
00:35:03,739 --> 00:35:05,001
See you.

638
00:35:15,674 --> 00:35:17,164
Uh-oh.

639
00:35:17,952 --> 00:35:22,321
So it's true. You lost my spirit stick.

640
00:35:22,219 --> 00:35:23,948
Pepper, I'm sorry. Look, I got distracted...

641
00:35:23,952 --> 00:35:26,785
Well, it was up to you to guard it with your lives.

642
00:35:26,743 --> 00:35:28,074
We'll find it, Pepper.

643
00:35:28,091 --> 00:35:29,353
Oh, you better.

644
00:35:29,374 --> 00:35:31,934
Yeah, so, on the real, what happens if we don't?

645
00:35:31,909 --> 00:35:33,001
Oh, who knows?

646
00:35:33,031 --> 00:35:35,499
You remember that cheerleader I was telling you about?

647
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:37,097
Well, after she broke her leg,

648
00:35:37,138 --> 00:35:40,130
her entire team got some kind of nasty stomach virus,

649
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:43,457
and they all vomited on the competition floor, all right?

650
00:35:43,395 --> 00:35:45,693
And, needless to say,everyone was happy

651
00:35:45,673 --> 00:35:47,903
to see them go home the next day,

652
00:35:47,887 --> 00:35:50,014
including the judges.

653
00:35:52,956 --> 00:35:55,447
Okay, stop! We are not cursed.

654
00:35:55,426 --> 00:35:57,087
Not even the spirit stick gods

655
00:35:57,095 --> 00:35:58,722
can take this victory away from us.

656
00:35:58,731 --> 00:36:00,562
We are going to win, damn it.

657
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,391
Pyramid, seven, eight.

658
00:36:02,389 --> 00:36:04,220
One, two, three and four, five, six...

659
00:36:04,218 --> 00:36:05,446
Hey.

660
00:36:06,753 --> 00:36:08,721
You guys, get up!

661
00:36:10,956 --> 00:36:13,186
This is one fast-acting curse.

662
00:36:13,555 --> 00:36:15,079
Hey!

663
00:36:53,821 --> 00:36:55,186
Damn curse.

664
00:37:10,954 --> 00:37:12,444
Are those the Sharks? Yeah.

665
00:37:13,681 --> 00:37:15,615
Don't let them touch you.

666
00:37:17,916 --> 00:37:19,975
Let the curse be with you!

667
00:37:27,798 --> 00:37:29,959
This is all the money l've got on me right now.

668
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:33,006
So l can give you the rest as soon as l can, all right?

669
00:37:32,963 --> 00:37:35,193
That's not what l care about.

670
00:37:39,317 --> 00:37:40,648
So, what's your deal, Penn?

671
00:37:40,664 --> 00:37:42,256
Do you want to be here or not?

672
00:37:42,268 --> 00:37:44,930
At this minute, not so much.

673
00:37:44,898 --> 00:37:46,058
l'm serious.

674
00:37:46,086 --> 00:37:47,986
We want to win.

675
00:37:47,979 --> 00:37:50,812
Now you know what kind of snakes those Sharks really are.

676
00:37:50,803 --> 00:37:53,772
Yeah. They're like snarks.

677
00:37:54,332 --> 00:37:55,697
The enemy.

678
00:37:57,219 --> 00:37:58,811
Yeah, l get it, Chelsea.

679
00:37:58,824 --> 00:38:00,314
Do you?

680
00:38:00,332 --> 00:38:04,564
Look, l get it.You're not into me.Nothing's gonna happen.

681
00:38:05,593 --> 00:38:07,288
But it will happen for this team.

682
00:38:07,294 --> 00:38:10,286
And the only way it's gonna work is if we do this together.

683
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,406
Yeah.

684
00:38:11,433 --> 00:38:14,368
So, you're like with us or what?

685
00:38:14,321 --> 00:38:17,779
''j'' to the ''E'' to the ''T'' to the ''S''

686
00:38:17,722 --> 00:38:20,782
jets kick ass from east to west!

687
00:38:20,737 --> 00:38:22,329
You know they stole the stick.

688
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:25,777
lt don't matter who took it, we got to bust a cap in this curse.

689
00:38:25,711 --> 00:38:27,110
Even Ruben thinks so now.

690
00:38:27,122 --> 00:38:30,148
AEYSHA: You know what?l think it's time for Sarah to do her thing.

691
00:38:30,106 --> 00:38:33,837
A cheer sacrifice?Has it really come to that?

692
00:38:33,764 --> 00:38:37,131
Well, if it'll get us a win,we'll do it at midnight.

693
00:38:48,106 --> 00:38:51,303
O mighty fallen cheer angels,

694
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,946
we summon thee from darkness.

695
00:38:53,913 --> 00:38:55,881
We're sorry about your spirit stick,

696
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:59,636
but shouldn't you be cursing the skanky succubae that stole it?

697
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,857
Not us.

698
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:04,068
While you process our request,

699
00:39:04,051 --> 00:39:06,849
will you please accept our sacrifices?

700
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:08,836
Go, spirits!

701
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:13,186
lt wouldn't hurt.

702
00:39:26,158 --> 00:39:29,559
Girl! Your lucky strapless?

703
00:39:29,495 --> 00:39:31,929
lf you love something, set it free.

704
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:38,991
Oh, my God.The cheer spirits are here.

705
00:39:38,928 --> 00:39:40,896
They don't sound cheerful.

706
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,758
Maybe it was just the wind.

707
00:39:49,708 --> 00:39:52,040
That's for trying to get us cursed, freaks!

708
00:39:52,018 --> 00:39:53,417
Yeah, except that you don't deserve.

709
00:39:53,429 --> 00:39:56,296
Like we need to steal the spirit stick to win.

710
00:39:56,253 --> 00:39:59,654
You couldn't even beat me in a cheer-off, loser.

711
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:01,649
All right, that's it.You want a real battle?

712
00:40:01,643 --> 00:40:03,634
Sharks and Jets,right now.

713
00:40:03,632 --> 00:40:05,497
Fair fight. No contact.

714
00:40:05,493 --> 00:40:06,721
Cheer rumble!

715
00:40:06,745 --> 00:40:07,871
Let's go.

716
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,367
Yeah, let's go,you guys.Let's do this.

717
00:40:09,376 --> 00:40:11,571
Come on, you guys,go around the corner.

718
00:40:11,558 --> 00:40:13,719
Come on, guys, let's go.

719
00:40:13,707 --> 00:40:14,799
Hey, snarks.

720
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:15,854
Bring it.

721
00:40:43,834 --> 00:40:44,960
Jets!

722
00:40:50,765 --> 00:40:51,993
Sharks!

723
00:40:57,695 --> 00:40:58,787
Jets!

724
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:02,387
Sharks!

725
00:41:16,593 --> 00:41:18,254
Pyramid! Higher!

726
00:41:41,972 --> 00:41:45,271
What happened tonight is an all-time,

727
00:41:45,212 --> 00:41:49,376
an all-time low for Camp Spirit Thunder!

728
00:41:49,286 --> 00:41:53,222
You've just ruined this camp's chances against Vance.

729
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:54,626
And, even worse,

730
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:56,442
you lost my spirit stick.

731
00:41:56,441 --> 00:41:58,409
Brooke, give Pepper back her spirit stick.

732
00:41:58,399 --> 00:42:00,162
Hey, loser,if l had the stick,

733
00:42:00,164 --> 00:42:01,688
why would my team have gotten hurt?

734
00:42:01,703 --> 00:42:03,330
Because your team started the rumble.

735
00:42:03,371 --> 00:42:06,067
You don't even deserve...

736
00:42:06,035 --> 00:42:07,935
Enough!

737
00:42:07,927 --> 00:42:12,887
You kids have let down yourselves, your camp and your country.

738
00:42:12,773 --> 00:42:14,070
Take a look around.

739
00:42:14,088 --> 00:42:17,251
Neither of you have enough team members to compete now.

740
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,498
So in the morning, when you get up,

741
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:22,707
there'll be buses here waiting to take you all home.

742
00:42:22,655 --> 00:42:23,986
Good night!

743
00:42:32,055 --> 00:42:35,889
Tomorrow, we need to whip those little Prairie Dogs into shape.

744
00:42:35,809 --> 00:42:39,006
Then girlfriend,you'd better pray for a miracle.

745
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:16,017
Let's just go home and pretend

746
00:43:16,011 --> 00:43:18,036
this whole sorry trip never happened.

747
00:43:22,107 --> 00:43:23,734
What a nightmare.

748
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:35,555
Where's the
spirit stick?

749
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:38,111
Brooke, l know
you have it.

750
00:43:38,085 --> 00:43:40,747
You're still the rock star of stupid.

751
00:43:40,716 --> 00:43:42,911
Why would l keep the stick and stay cursed?

752
00:43:42,898 --> 00:43:44,889
Can we all just get over it?

753
00:43:44,887 --> 00:43:47,048
Even Paris and Nicole settled their...

754
00:43:47,037 --> 00:43:48,664
Shut up, Ruben!

755
00:43:51,561 --> 00:43:53,085
Pepper?

756
00:43:53,967 --> 00:43:59,963
Run! Flip! Jump high!You dissed the spirits,and die, die, die!

757
00:43:59,806 --> 00:44:01,364
Pepper, let go!

758
00:44:09,977 --> 00:44:11,877
What the hell?

759
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:13,497
Brooke didn't steal the spirit stick.

760
00:44:13,507 --> 00:44:15,600
She would've given it back by now to get rid of the curse.

761
00:44:15,592 --> 00:44:18,390
Whatever! She is still a sick individual.

762
00:44:18,351 --> 00:44:22,310
Now, just go to sleep.l don't need any more drama tonight, okay?

763
00:44:25,217 --> 00:44:29,347
But that means Penn had nothing to do with it, either.

764
00:44:58,264 --> 00:44:59,891
You guys,we can't leave like this.

765
00:44:59,901 --> 00:45:01,493
lt's like we're giving up.

766
00:45:01,505 --> 00:45:03,564
l promised you guys a win,

767
00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:06,187
and we're going to get one.

768
00:45:10,906 --> 00:45:12,203
Pretty.

769
00:45:18,478 --> 00:45:20,742
Brooke,l don't think you stole the spirit stick anymore.

770
00:45:20,724 --> 00:45:23,420
Like l give a flying tuck what you think.

771
00:45:23,419 --> 00:45:24,716
Well, l do think you want to win

772
00:45:24,734 --> 00:45:26,292
Camp Championships as much as l do.

773
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:27,604
So what?

774
00:45:27,622 --> 00:45:29,089
Well, if there was any chance to stay and compete,

775
00:45:29,097 --> 00:45:30,530
you'd consider it, right?

776
00:45:30,541 --> 00:45:32,031
Even if it meant coming together.

777
00:45:32,338 --> 00:45:33,703
Ew! That's like cheer-cest!

778
00:45:33,717 --> 00:45:36,345
Chelsea, l meant combining our teams.

779
00:45:36,445 --> 00:45:38,037
Look, it's about not quitting.

780
00:45:38,049 --> 00:45:40,176
Pepper wants her camp to win,l think she'll help us.

781
00:45:40,167 --> 00:45:41,429
Brilliant plan, Carson.

782
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:43,645
Look, l think the Jets are already on the spirits' hit list.

783
00:45:43,632 --> 00:45:45,964
Because of you.

784
00:45:45,942 --> 00:45:49,810
Okay, well,if we leave now,we'll all stay cursed.

785
00:45:49,728 --> 00:45:51,320
Come on, Brooke.

786
00:45:55,279 --> 00:45:57,713
Boo that, freak!We're out of here.

787
00:46:04,968 --> 00:46:06,060
Penn?

788
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:10,293
Look, l'm sorry for...

789
00:46:10,262 --> 00:46:12,594
Well, it's kind of a long list.

790
00:46:14,273 --> 00:46:15,763
Later, Carson.

791
00:46:17,353 --> 00:46:19,218
You can call me skids!

792
00:46:25,021 --> 00:46:26,511
What?

793
00:46:26,529 --> 00:46:29,225
You wanted me to say yes to Hilary Duff light?

794
00:46:29,192 --> 00:46:30,591
Strap on a pair, Penn.

795
00:46:30,603 --> 00:46:31,968
Can l borrow yours?

796
00:46:31,983 --> 00:46:34,577
Don't even try to out-bitch me.

797
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:36,984
Yeah. Brooke's like the Olym-bitch champion.

798
00:46:36,956 --> 00:46:38,116
No doubt.

799
00:46:38,143 --> 00:46:39,701
l just never pegged you for a quitter.

800
00:46:39,715 --> 00:46:41,239
l'm not quitting, Penn.

801
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:43,690
l'm embracing my future.

802
00:46:43,662 --> 00:46:45,459
Which is freaking bright!

803
00:46:45,459 --> 00:46:47,359
Everyone says so.

804
00:46:47,352 --> 00:46:49,650
They say a lot of other stuff about her, too, you know.

805
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:51,257
Shut up, Chelsea!

806
00:47:08,014 --> 00:47:09,242
Okay, we're in.

807
00:47:09,265 --> 00:47:10,425
Yes.

808
00:47:12,794 --> 00:47:14,227
l'm captain, of course.

809
00:47:15,362 --> 00:47:17,296
You two perform together?

810
00:47:17,287 --> 00:47:19,653
ln what? A cheer death match?

811
00:47:19,629 --> 00:47:20,994
No. We would be...

812
00:47:21,008 --> 00:47:22,908
Co-captains.

813
00:47:23,479 --> 00:47:26,573
Pepper, even with only half our squads,

814
00:47:26,526 --> 00:47:28,790
we've still got the best cheerleaders in camp.

815
00:47:28,773 --> 00:47:32,732
Hey, P-Dog! lt is only a jump if your feet come off the ground.

816
00:47:32,655 --> 00:47:33,952
Okay, hon?Whatever.

817
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:36,666
Pep, l'm trying to tell you, these Prairie Dogs are so bad,

818
00:47:36,634 --> 00:47:38,363
they can't even roll over.

819
00:47:38,366 --> 00:47:40,391
Don't give up on them yet.

820
00:47:41,093 --> 00:47:45,655
Come on, you all.One, two, three, four,five, six, seven, eight.

821
00:47:45,553 --> 00:47:48,716
Two, two, three, four...

822
00:47:50,526 --> 00:47:54,462
We are the Flamingos!We are the Flamingos!

823
00:47:54,376 --> 00:47:56,469
Look. Please give us a second chance.

824
00:47:56,462 --> 00:47:58,862
Sorry, don't believe in those, angel pants.So you all just...

825
00:47:58,836 --> 00:48:00,531
We are the Flamingos!

826
00:48:00,536 --> 00:48:04,302
We are the Flamingos!We are the Flamingos!

827
00:48:04,226 --> 00:48:05,284
Damn.

828
00:48:05,317 --> 00:48:07,512
No Flamingo could throw down like that last year.

829
00:48:07,499 --> 00:48:10,525
Get out of my camp,Voorhees!

830
00:48:10,483 --> 00:48:12,348
Hey, we're just passing through,ma'am.

831
00:48:12,343 --> 00:48:14,675
Don't get your scort in a twist.

832
00:48:16,354 --> 00:48:20,188
Wouldn't it be fun to,like, rip him a new one in Championships?

833
00:48:21,873 --> 00:48:23,932
All right, you guys.We called you out here to tell you

834
00:48:23,926 --> 00:48:25,757
that Pepper got us approved with the council.

835
00:48:25,755 --> 00:48:27,689
And now all we need is a new name.

836
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,773
l was thinking the East-West Spirit?

837
00:48:29,765 --> 00:48:32,063
Ain't that an Amtrak train?

838
00:48:32,043 --> 00:48:36,002
Why can't we have a cool name,like TomKat or Bennifer?

839
00:48:35,926 --> 00:48:37,587
How about the Jarks?

840
00:48:37,594 --> 00:48:39,459
How about

841
00:48:39,455 --> 00:48:40,820
the Sharts?

842
00:48:43,209 --> 00:48:44,904
How about the Shets?

843
00:48:44,909 --> 00:48:48,470
l mean, l don't see you guys coming up with something better.

844
00:48:48,406 --> 00:48:50,499
All right.We're the Shets.

845
00:48:50,492 --> 00:48:52,790
Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm.This ain't gonna work.

846
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:54,397
Remember what happened to Tupac and Biggie?

847
00:48:54,407 --> 00:48:56,068
We'll make it work.

848
00:48:56,075 --> 00:48:57,542
We're combining the best parts of both routines,

849
00:48:57,551 --> 00:48:58,575
so get up!Get up. Up, guys.

850
00:48:58,610 --> 00:49:01,204
Come on, you guys,positions. Get up!

851
00:49:09,518 --> 00:49:11,577
Penn and Chelsea,get in the back.

852
00:49:12,695 --> 00:49:15,255
l so don't do the back row.Tell her, Brooke.

853
00:49:15,229 --> 00:49:18,630
Why doesn't Goth-a-sauraus step to the back?

854
00:49:18,566 --> 00:49:20,466
Because Goth...

855
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:22,449
Sarah can dance her little ass off.

856
00:49:22,448 --> 00:49:24,609
Now let's try this.Come on.

857
00:49:27,037 --> 00:49:28,527
Chels, please.

858
00:49:31,271 --> 00:49:33,239
Five, six, seven, eight.

859
00:49:33,228 --> 00:49:37,392
One, two, three, four,five, six, seven and eight.

860
00:49:37,303 --> 00:49:38,998
Ready? Try it.

861
00:49:39,036 --> 00:49:41,061
Five, six, seven, eight.

862
00:49:41,057 --> 00:49:45,050
One, two, three,four, five, six.Two more.

863
00:49:44,972 --> 00:49:48,908
One, two, three,four, five, six...Last one.

864
00:49:48,822 --> 00:49:52,815
One, two, three, four,five, six, seven and eight.

865
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,865
l got this.

866
00:50:06,725 --> 00:50:09,216
All right, everybody,that was great.We got the fever.

867
00:50:09,195 --> 00:50:11,459
Yeah, bite me.

868
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:13,068
You're doing great, honey.

869
00:50:18,179 --> 00:50:19,703
Hey, Penn.

870
00:50:19,719 --> 00:50:20,743
l...

871
00:50:20,778 --> 00:50:22,678
l'll be back before next practice.

872
00:50:22,670 --> 00:50:24,399
You know, l was hoping that we could talk.

873
00:50:24,403 --> 00:50:26,166
And by talk l mean,

874
00:50:26,168 --> 00:50:29,194
you know, l thought that maybe we could have a do-over.

875
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:32,917
Do-over? Carson,l think we're done.

876
00:50:32,842 --> 00:50:36,903
Look, Penn, l'm sorry l accused you of stealing the spirit stick,

877
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:39,050
and, of course,embarrassing you

878
00:50:39,033 --> 00:50:41,228
and telling everyone your darkest secret.

879
00:50:41,215 --> 00:50:42,978
That was bad, but...

880
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:46,934
This could be going better.

881
00:50:48,017 --> 00:50:51,748
Look, Carson,l'm gonna work my ass off to help our team win.

882
00:50:51,675 --> 00:50:53,199
But you and me,

883
00:50:53,215 --> 00:50:54,842
l think we should stick to our own coasts.

884
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:56,443
All right?

885
00:51:01,589 --> 00:51:04,217
Seven, eight.

886
00:51:04,188 --> 00:51:06,748
One, two, three, four,five, six, seven, eight.

887
00:51:06,723 --> 00:51:10,750
One, two, three, four,five, six, seven, eight.

888
00:51:12,049 --> 00:51:15,541
One, two, three, four,five, six, seven, eight.

889
00:51:15,482 --> 00:51:19,441
One, two, three, four,five, six, seven, eight.

890
00:51:34,284 --> 00:51:35,410
Tight work.

891
00:51:54,368 --> 00:51:55,767
Hey!

892
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,753
Pepper's lost her mind.

893
00:52:04,763 --> 00:52:07,095
l think she put out an AMBER Alert, too.

894
00:52:07,074 --> 00:52:08,735
Man, l'd love to know who took it.

895
00:52:08,742 --> 00:52:11,506
l smell P-Dog.

896
00:52:11,469 --> 00:52:12,663
No.

897
00:52:12,689 --> 00:52:14,156
l bet it was the Flamingos.

898
00:52:14,165 --> 00:52:17,157
Look, either way,let's just hope the curse is done.

899
00:52:17,116 --> 00:52:18,674
We need all the help we can get.

900
00:52:18,688 --> 00:52:19,950
You know what?You're right.

901
00:52:19,972 --> 00:52:21,837
Let's practice our routine one more time.

902
00:52:23,437 --> 00:52:25,166
What? You guys! Ow!

903
00:52:43,875 --> 00:52:46,139
Get it, boy.You better work it.

904
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:12,854
Bet l can cheer you up.

905
00:53:14,227 --> 00:53:16,024
Don't be a wad, Penn.

906
00:53:17,435 --> 00:53:19,027
Go find Carson.

907
00:53:20,804 --> 00:53:21,896
Excuse me?

908
00:53:21,927 --> 00:53:22,951
Yeah, l know.

909
00:53:22,986 --> 00:53:24,817
Never thought l'd say those words.

910
00:53:24,814 --> 00:53:28,910
But, hey, if you're into a bony ass and cankles,then what the hell.

911
00:53:28,825 --> 00:53:31,487
Knot up! Go get her, fool.

912
00:53:31,456 --> 00:53:33,617
Yeah, but after she ratted me out

913
00:53:33,605 --> 00:53:35,698
l can't make myself trust her, you know.

914
00:53:35,691 --> 00:53:36,919
Why not?

915
00:53:37,776 --> 00:53:39,505
Damn.

916
00:53:39,509 --> 00:53:41,136
l must be insane.

917
00:53:42,365 --> 00:53:44,390
Doesn't mean l have to be.

918
00:53:46,151 --> 00:53:48,051
Do what you want, Penn.

919
00:53:48,043 --> 00:53:50,409
But don't be a pendejo.

920
00:53:53,434 --> 00:53:55,766
Brooke, thanks.

921
00:53:58,856 --> 00:54:00,118
Whatever.

922
00:54:04,022 --> 00:54:05,580
By the way,

923
00:54:05,594 --> 00:54:06,856
your loss.

924
00:54:06,878 --> 00:54:08,607
l'm double-jointed.

925
00:54:12,267 --> 00:54:14,201
Five, six, seven, eight.One, two, three, four,

926
00:54:14,192 --> 00:54:17,491
five, six, seven, eight.One, two, three, four,

927
00:54:17,433 --> 00:54:18,991
five, six, seven, eight.

928
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:20,302
One, and two,and three, and four...Hey!

929
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:22,550
Ever heard of this new thing called counting?

930
00:54:22,535 --> 00:54:24,298
Everybody stretch! Now!

931
00:54:24,299 --> 00:54:26,267
Ever heard of team work?Shut up, Carson.

932
00:54:26,256 --> 00:54:27,484
Yo, watch it, cuz.

933
00:54:27,507 --> 00:54:28,701
Yo, stop fronting, cuz.

934
00:54:28,759 --> 00:54:30,386
l heard you with Chicago.

935
00:54:30,395 --> 00:54:31,953
You're not just an Oreo,Aeysha.

936
00:54:31,967 --> 00:54:33,093
You're double-stuffed.

937
00:54:33,123 --> 00:54:34,215
You're wrong, Brooke!

938
00:54:34,245 --> 00:54:37,578
My girl, she been pulling drive-bys since she was a shorty.

939
00:54:37,518 --> 00:54:38,883
Yo, she was drinking 40s off the nipple.

940
00:54:38,898 --> 00:54:39,990
Carson?

941
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:42,011
So, don't be getting up on her Kool-Aid, biatch,

942
00:54:42,010 --> 00:54:43,739
'cause l have seen what she's done

943
00:54:43,742 --> 00:54:46,575
to fugly swamp donkeys like you, fo shizzle.

944
00:54:47,336 --> 00:54:49,668
Carson, it's over.

945
00:54:49,645 --> 00:54:50,669
Are you sure?

946
00:54:50,705 --> 00:54:53,469
l cannot watch you ''fo shizzle'' ever again.

947
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:56,032
Good.

948
00:55:02,256 --> 00:55:06,192
Look, you all. All this,''Girl, please'' and cursing,

949
00:55:06,106 --> 00:55:07,630
it ain't me.

950
00:55:07,645 --> 00:55:09,545
l mean, it isn't me.

951
00:55:09,538 --> 00:55:12,006
l just did it to get your respect.

952
00:55:11,977 --> 00:55:13,945
See, the real Aeysha got teased every day

953
00:55:13,934 --> 00:55:15,902
in junior high for being an Oreo.

954
00:55:15,891 --> 00:55:19,520
You know,black on the outside,white on the inside.

955
00:55:19,452 --> 00:55:21,977
And l've been hood ratting it up ever since.

956
00:55:23,559 --> 00:55:24,856
You're whiter than me.

957
00:55:24,875 --> 00:55:28,072
Maybe so, but,that's who l am.

958
00:55:28,019 --> 00:55:30,419
Just a black girl who enunciates.

959
00:55:32,671 --> 00:55:34,730
Do you have something to say?

960
00:55:34,725 --> 00:55:38,388
Hey, if you want respect that badly,

961
00:55:38,318 --> 00:55:40,377
just be a bitch, like me.

962
00:55:41,719 --> 00:55:43,949
Same respect,half the effort.

963
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:46,197
Guess the bitch is out of the bag.

964
00:55:46,211 --> 00:55:47,701
Truth out!

965
00:55:50,575 --> 00:55:52,042
l'm a virgin.

966
00:55:55,964 --> 00:55:57,454
Technically.

967
00:55:57,473 --> 00:55:59,873
l just act that way so guys will like me.

968
00:55:59,847 --> 00:56:02,281
But it's really hard being slutty all the time.

969
00:56:02,253 --> 00:56:04,744
l don't know how you do it, Brooke.

970
00:56:11,654 --> 00:56:15,590
My parents aren't bribing me to be a cheerleader.

971
00:56:15,504 --> 00:56:18,564
l do it because cheerleading is dark

972
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,181
and twisted.

973
00:56:20,188 --> 00:56:21,280
Are you high?

974
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:23,176
No. Think about it.

975
00:56:23,172 --> 00:56:24,605
We cheer for the other team's failure

976
00:56:24,616 --> 00:56:28,382
just as much as we cheer for own team's victory.

977
00:56:28,306 --> 00:56:29,967
That's so twisted.

978
00:56:29,974 --> 00:56:31,236
Sarah?

979
00:56:31,258 --> 00:56:33,818
Okay, l'm a little high.

980
00:56:33,793 --> 00:56:35,420
Yo, this is like confession.

981
00:56:37,257 --> 00:56:39,487
l'm out of here.

982
00:56:39,472 --> 00:56:40,734
No, wait.

983
00:56:43,032 --> 00:56:44,397
l have something to confess.

984
00:56:44,412 --> 00:56:45,743
This should be good.

985
00:56:45,759 --> 00:56:47,522
Miss USA has a secret.

986
00:56:47,525 --> 00:56:49,993
Spill, Tara Connor.

987
00:56:49,962 --> 00:56:51,520
l'm scared.

988
00:56:51,535 --> 00:56:52,934
lt's okay, Carson.

989
00:56:52,947 --> 00:56:54,380
You can do it.

990
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:56,881
No, that's it.

991
00:56:56,861 --> 00:56:58,226
l'm scared.

992
00:57:00,871 --> 00:57:02,168
You know, l act like the fearless captain

993
00:57:02,187 --> 00:57:03,449
who's not afraid to go for it,

994
00:57:03,471 --> 00:57:08,204
but, in reality,going for it is my biggest fear.

995
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:10,252
l'm so confused.

996
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,640
But don't let it stop you, l mean,it happens all the time.

997
00:57:12,614 --> 00:57:15,344
Yeah. What l meant was,

998
00:57:15,309 --> 00:57:17,300
l just wish l could believe in myself

999
00:57:17,299 --> 00:57:19,665
as much as l believe in all of you.

1000
00:57:27,887 --> 00:57:29,320
l'm not gay.

1001
00:57:31,223 --> 00:57:33,088
l like girls

1002
00:57:33,084 --> 00:57:34,813
a lot.

1003
00:57:34,817 --> 00:57:36,409
Are you serious?

1004
00:57:37,608 --> 00:57:39,872
l'm straight.

1005
00:57:39,855 --> 00:57:43,951
You girls just assumed,

1006
00:57:43,864 --> 00:57:48,460
so once you started changing in front of me, l couldn't stop you.

1007
00:57:48,357 --> 00:57:51,849
And then, l was like committed.

1008
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:53,314
Hold up.

1009
00:57:53,330 --> 00:57:56,697
There's no way this guy's not gay, and l'll prove it.

1010
00:58:01,672 --> 00:58:03,105
Okay.

1011
00:58:03,115 --> 00:58:04,605
He is not gay.

1012
00:58:04,624 --> 00:58:06,922
No, but he is dead.

1013
00:58:06,902 --> 00:58:08,563
Get him. Get him.

1014
00:58:13,062 --> 00:58:16,463
Hey, Mom. Hey, can l speak to the General?

1015
00:58:17,361 --> 00:58:18,726
All right.

1016
00:58:21,019 --> 00:58:22,577
Hello, sir.

1017
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:24,252
No, everything's fine.

1018
00:58:24,259 --> 00:58:26,022
l'm fine.

1019
00:58:26,024 --> 00:58:27,514
No, l'm great.

1020
00:58:29,970 --> 00:58:33,406
Actually, l'm not at Warrior Camp exactly.

1021
00:58:33,339 --> 00:58:35,000
l'm at Cheer Camp.

1022
00:58:37,285 --> 00:58:40,812
Because l'm a cheerleader.

1023
00:58:42,515 --> 00:58:44,176
Yes, one of those.

1024
00:58:47,489 --> 00:58:49,047
Sir?

1025
00:58:49,061 --> 00:58:50,528
Dad?

1026
00:58:50,536 --> 00:58:51,525
Dad!

1027
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,112
Listen.

1028
00:58:55,125 --> 00:58:56,854
This is the funny thing, when you hear the rest,

1029
00:58:56,857 --> 00:59:00,054
cheerleading is gonna sound like the good part.

1030
00:59:01,541 --> 00:59:03,168
About West Point...

1031
00:59:04,172 --> 00:59:07,869
Okay, that was traumatic but good, right?

1032
00:59:07,798 --> 00:59:09,231
l mean, now we can work as a team.

1033
00:59:09,241 --> 00:59:11,607
Yeah. A team of freaks.

1034
00:59:11,584 --> 00:59:13,779
We are not a team, okay?

1035
00:59:13,766 --> 00:59:17,224
We can't combine routines and this was a dumbass idea!

1036
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,400
Tell them, Ruben. We can do this.

1037
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:24,090
We blow. We cannot do this.

1038
00:59:24,097 --> 00:59:26,531
Because we're cursed, all of us.

1039
00:59:26,503 --> 00:59:29,472
Holy crap, Ruben, snap out of it!

1040
00:59:30,738 --> 00:59:33,172
What have you done with happy Ruben?

1041
00:59:33,144 --> 00:59:34,611
lt's weird, you know.

1042
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:36,747
Now that l'm not gay anymore,

1043
00:59:36,738 --> 00:59:38,535
l'm not gay anymore.

1044
00:59:38,535 --> 00:59:40,059
Okay, we're freaks!

1045
00:59:40,075 --> 00:59:41,542
But let's make that work for us.

1046
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:43,814
Come on, you guys. l mean, there has to be some way

1047
00:59:43,797 --> 00:59:46,027
that we can perform together.

1048
00:59:47,935 --> 00:59:49,994
We can start with couples.

1049
01:00:09,881 --> 01:00:11,143
l'll take the lead.

1050
01:00:11,165 --> 01:00:12,393
So, like, we're gonna copy them?

1051
01:00:12,416 --> 01:00:14,179
l'm gonna move to the right then to the left.

1052
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:15,613
Okay.

1053
01:00:15,625 --> 01:00:16,717
Start up like that, all right?

1054
01:00:16,748 --> 01:00:17,772
Okay.

1055
01:00:17,806 --> 01:00:19,467
Here we go.

1056
01:00:19,475 --> 01:00:20,635
Hey, you want to try this?

1057
01:00:20,661 --> 01:00:21,753
There you go.

1058
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:24,431
Top again.

1059
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:29,868
All right, top again. Here we go.

1060
01:00:35,838 --> 01:00:38,568
Give me a turn. There you go.

1061
01:01:06,447 --> 01:01:07,709
For real.

1062
01:01:09,687 --> 01:01:11,154
This could work.

1063
01:01:11,162 --> 01:01:13,562
And l'll prove it. Get over here.

1064
01:01:15,686 --> 01:01:18,416
All right, everybody ready? From the top.

1065
01:01:18,382 --> 01:01:20,942
Look, l'm cool about you coming out of the straight closet.

1066
01:01:20,916 --> 01:01:23,111
Please, you're just saying that so l'll try to catch you.

1067
01:01:23,098 --> 01:01:24,656
Try?

1068
01:01:24,670 --> 01:01:27,639
All right. Five, six, seven, eight.

1069
01:02:19,856 --> 01:02:21,824
That was tight. You know what?

1070
01:02:21,877 --> 01:02:23,845
l think we could actually win this.

1071
01:02:25,984 --> 01:02:27,451
Maybe we should make sure.

1072
01:02:27,459 --> 01:02:31,691
''Compare the opposing army so you may know where strength lies.''

1073
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:32,759
Recon?

1074
01:02:38,786 --> 01:02:40,811
Hey, guys. We need to get some disguises.

1075
01:02:47,545 --> 01:02:49,775
They practice on stage 70A. Find it.

1076
01:02:49,758 --> 01:02:51,783
Cell phones ready?

1077
01:02:51,779 --> 01:02:54,407
Recon positions by texting only. Break!

1078
01:03:09,554 --> 01:03:11,283
Chels,

1079
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:13,152
l'm right next to you.

1080
01:03:29,062 --> 01:03:30,393
Thank you.

1081
01:03:38,591 --> 01:03:40,354
Hey, Ron, get the gate for me.

1082
01:03:42,088 --> 01:03:43,953
Hello, Mr. Voorhees.

1083
01:03:43,950 --> 01:03:45,781
The Flamingos just started...

1084
01:03:45,778 --> 01:03:47,746
Listen, we have got to tighten up the security.

1085
01:03:47,735 --> 01:03:50,101
l need more time for my Flamingos...

1086
01:03:50,558 --> 01:03:52,355
Keep up the good work.

1087
01:03:54,826 --> 01:03:57,317
l guess your father would laugh at us, huh?

1088
01:03:57,296 --> 01:03:59,355
He's not big into laughter.

1089
01:03:59,350 --> 01:04:02,046
You know, l told him everything.

1090
01:04:02,013 --> 01:04:03,139
Really?

1091
01:04:03,168 --> 01:04:05,636
Then what'd he say about you being a cheerleader?

1092
01:04:05,606 --> 01:04:07,631
Well, that he laughed at.

1093
01:04:10,066 --> 01:04:12,296
Hey, covert cheer-ops.

1094
01:04:12,826 --> 01:04:14,589
Two-to-one pyramid.

1095
01:04:17,349 --> 01:04:20,546
All right, Ruben, Eric, Nick, you three in the corner, be the base.

1096
01:04:20,493 --> 01:04:23,189
Come on, guys, hurry up. Let's go.

1097
01:04:23,157 --> 01:04:24,647
Chelsea, watch out for the guard.

1098
01:04:24,665 --> 01:04:27,532
Brooke, first level. All right.

1099
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:29,319
One, two, three.

1100
01:04:30,728 --> 01:04:32,457
All right. Now, Carson.

1101
01:04:32,461 --> 01:04:34,088
One, two, three.

1102
01:04:41,124 --> 01:04:44,560
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

1103
01:04:44,492 --> 01:04:46,722
l don't want to see any loose knees.

1104
01:04:46,707 --> 01:04:49,141
Jason, that's on the two. You're always late.

1105
01:04:49,113 --> 01:04:50,876
Wait, how did you guys get in here?

1106
01:04:50,877 --> 01:04:54,745
Seriously, that guy wasn't even a real guard.

1107
01:04:54,664 --> 01:04:57,189
''lf an enemy leaves the door open, you must rush in.''

1108
01:04:57,166 --> 01:04:58,565
Art of War.

1109
01:04:59,669 --> 01:05:01,068
Base, keep it together now.

1110
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:04,481
l really want to see you attack the ground. Oh, yeah!

1111
01:05:06,406 --> 01:05:08,067
Oh, my gosh.

1112
01:05:08,075 --> 01:05:09,872
Welcome to cheer-topia.

1113
01:05:09,871 --> 01:05:12,032
State of the art everything.

1114
01:05:13,112 --> 01:05:14,807
ls that Letty Trotter?

1115
01:05:14,812 --> 01:05:16,279
Choreographer to the stars?

1116
01:05:16,289 --> 01:05:17,449
That look on your faces,

1117
01:05:17,475 --> 01:05:19,636
that's the same look l had after my divorce.

1118
01:05:19,625 --> 01:05:21,923
So sad to see a dream die.

1119
01:05:23,187 --> 01:05:25,985
Anyhoo, give my best to Pepper, would you?

1120
01:05:30,341 --> 01:05:32,741
Vance wasn't bluffing.

1121
01:05:32,716 --> 01:05:34,741
Their tumbling is amazing.

1122
01:05:34,737 --> 01:05:35,829
Those Flamingos are like...

1123
01:05:35,859 --> 01:05:37,417
Better than us.

1124
01:05:37,945 --> 01:05:39,674
We need to come up with something really good.

1125
01:05:39,710 --> 01:05:40,734
No, really?

1126
01:05:40,769 --> 01:05:42,361
l thought we'd come up with something bad

1127
01:05:42,373 --> 01:05:43,931
and see if we can win that way.

1128
01:05:43,945 --> 01:05:47,108
Sorry, it's a reflex.

1129
01:05:47,057 --> 01:05:48,081
What are we going to do?

1130
01:05:48,117 --> 01:05:49,914
Look, l don't know, okay? l can't believe it.

1131
01:05:49,913 --> 01:05:53,542
After all this, l just wanted to win Camp Championships once.

1132
01:05:53,474 --> 01:05:54,805
Don't freak out, Carson.

1133
01:05:54,822 --> 01:05:57,484
Yeah, easy for you to say. You've won.

1134
01:06:00,789 --> 01:06:03,781
Look, our dance routine is better than theirs.

1135
01:06:03,741 --> 01:06:06,141
We just need a triple threat.

1136
01:06:06,115 --> 01:06:08,549
Let's think. What would Sun Tzu do?

1137
01:06:12,019 --> 01:06:15,511
''Make use of concubines who are greedy for gold.''

1138
01:06:24,532 --> 01:06:26,864
l don't think Sun Tzu would be riding a rollercoaster, Carson.

1139
01:06:26,842 --> 01:06:28,810
You see how the red and blue rails loop?

1140
01:06:28,799 --> 01:06:30,562
Criss-cross and then corkscrew away?

1141
01:06:30,564 --> 01:06:32,555
Yeah, almost like a double helix.

1142
01:06:33,548 --> 01:06:35,379
That'll be the path of the two flyers.

1143
01:06:35,377 --> 01:06:36,366
Sweet! Sweet!

1144
01:06:36,403 --> 01:06:38,098
No one's ever done that before.

1145
01:06:38,104 --> 01:06:39,969
We're gonna need something new if we want to win.

1146
01:06:39,965 --> 01:06:42,229
lmagine if we pull it off. That would be sick!

1147
01:06:42,243 --> 01:06:43,676
lt'd be awesome. So cool!

1148
01:06:43,687 --> 01:06:45,951
But is it possible?

1149
01:06:45,932 --> 01:06:48,799
Yeah, it's gonna be really difficult for the flyers.

1150
01:06:48,756 --> 01:06:50,417
Who's gonna do it?

1151
01:06:51,483 --> 01:06:53,041
Five, six, seven, eight...

1152
01:07:19,107 --> 01:07:20,267
You okay?

1153
01:07:20,295 --> 01:07:21,387
Yeah. l'm fine.

1154
01:07:21,418 --> 01:07:23,477
All right, you guys, let's do it again.

1155
01:07:36,819 --> 01:07:39,947
One, two, three, four, five, six...

1156
01:08:10,058 --> 01:08:12,390
Hey, Aeysha, who taught you to sew?

1157
01:08:12,368 --> 01:08:13,630
Martha Stewart.

1158
01:08:13,652 --> 01:08:16,246
All right. One portable hot press.

1159
01:08:16,218 --> 01:08:18,243
Nice work. Where'd you find that?

1160
01:08:18,239 --> 01:08:22,198
Concierges can do anything all over the world.

1161
01:08:22,122 --> 01:08:25,455
You'll see for yourself when we win tomorrow.

1162
01:08:31,426 --> 01:08:33,621
Where in the world of competition sports

1163
01:08:33,608 --> 01:08:35,542
will you find two arch rivals,

1164
01:08:35,533 --> 01:08:37,694
forced by a dramatic twist of fate,

1165
01:08:37,682 --> 01:08:39,809
to join teams and combine their styles

1166
01:08:39,801 --> 01:08:41,894
to face a mysterious new challenger?

1167
01:08:41,885 --> 01:08:45,150
Well, right here at the All Star Cheer Camp Championships,

1168
01:08:45,094 --> 01:08:47,119
where one of these teams will win the title

1169
01:08:47,115 --> 01:08:49,015
and the right to represent the United States

1170
01:08:49,009 --> 01:08:50,874
in the World Cheer Exhibition Tour.

1171
01:08:50,869 --> 01:08:52,166
And who will that be?

1172
01:08:58,217 --> 01:09:03,154
Up next on Cheer TV, the most exciting cheerleading in the world!

1173
01:09:03,029 --> 01:09:04,963
All right. All right. All right. Ladies and gentlemen,

1174
01:09:04,955 --> 01:09:07,219
boys and girls, moms and dads,

1175
01:09:07,201 --> 01:09:10,261
welcome to the All Star Cheer Camp Championship!

1176
01:09:11,917 --> 01:09:13,282
You guys look great.

1177
01:09:13,296 --> 01:09:15,059
All right. Well, let's not waste any more time.

1178
01:09:15,062 --> 01:09:18,088
Let's bring out our first people, representing Camp Victory,

1179
01:09:18,045 --> 01:09:21,481
ladies and gentlemen, make a lot of noise for Sebring!

1180
01:09:44,803 --> 01:09:48,034
PEPPER.. Thank you, Prairie Dogs. Good luck in the competition.

1181
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:51,438
Next up on the practice pad, the Flamingos.

1182
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:03,685
...three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

1183
01:10:14,835 --> 01:10:15,961
Yeah.

1184
01:10:27,701 --> 01:10:28,690
Yeah!

1185
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:30,352
Yeah! Good job.

1186
01:10:31,198 --> 01:10:33,166
All right. All right!

1187
01:10:34,342 --> 01:10:36,139
Great job, Sebring!

1188
01:10:37,197 --> 01:10:38,721
They really brought it, didn't they?

1189
01:10:38,738 --> 01:10:42,401
Another fantastic routine. Am I right?

1190
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:45,496
Yeah! Are you ready for another?

1191
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:47,987
All right! All the way from South Dakota,

1192
01:10:47,978 --> 01:10:50,071
give it up for the Prairie Dogs!

1193
01:10:50,063 --> 01:10:52,122
Don't forget your lock out.

1194
01:10:59,304 --> 01:11:02,034
All right, guys, let's run it. Five, six...

1195
01:12:12,649 --> 01:12:14,583
This is a cheer-saster.

1196
01:12:14,766 --> 01:12:16,495
A cheer-tastrophe.

1197
01:12:17,013 --> 01:12:19,675
A total cheer-clipse of the sun.

1198
01:12:19,643 --> 01:12:20,632
Not bad. Good one.

1199
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:21,694
Yes.

1200
01:12:21,729 --> 01:12:23,162
Look, no, you guys are all wrong, okay.

1201
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:25,106
We're still good. We just...

1202
01:12:25,097 --> 01:12:26,997
We want the crowd to be pumped up.

1203
01:13:31,128 --> 01:13:34,359
MAN.. Okay, all right. They were really good, right?

1204
01:13:35,202 --> 01:13:38,035
Sharks, Jets, Shets.

1205
01:13:37,993 --> 01:13:40,223
lt doesn't really matter what you call yourselves.

1206
01:13:40,208 --> 01:13:44,008
Oh, and you call yourselves the Flaming Hoes.

1207
01:13:43,929 --> 01:13:46,056
Yeah. That's a bad choice.

1208
01:13:46,047 --> 01:13:50,381
...introduce to you, the mighty Flamingos.

1209
01:13:54,774 --> 01:13:58,141
Hope you've been practicing your loser facials.

1210
01:13:58,079 --> 01:14:00,411
Oh, wait. l think you're on.

1211
01:14:00,645 --> 01:14:02,545
You are so on.

1212
01:14:02,570 --> 01:14:04,197
Shelby, come on!

1213
01:14:04,207 --> 01:14:05,799
Shelby, come on!

1214
01:14:05,811 --> 01:14:06,903
Come on, you guys.

1215
01:14:06,934 --> 01:14:07,958
Let's go.

1216
01:14:16,655 --> 01:14:18,122
Flamingos, think pink!

1217
01:14:18,196 --> 01:14:19,686
Pink, pink, pink!

1218
01:14:52,398 --> 01:14:54,229
They're even better than l remembered.

1219
01:14:54,227 --> 01:14:56,354
And they're not even cursed.

1220
01:14:56,729 --> 01:14:58,094
Carson.

1221
01:15:11,616 --> 01:15:13,880
Okay, you've got to get over yourself and fast.

1222
01:15:13,862 --> 01:15:15,523
What? Stop psyching yourself out.

1223
01:15:15,531 --> 01:15:16,555
Look, l'm totally fine.

1224
01:15:16,589 --> 01:15:18,955
You're totally not, and they know that you're scared.

1225
01:15:18,932 --> 01:15:20,331
Look, what else do you want me to say?

1226
01:15:20,343 --> 01:15:21,708
You've been right about me all along.

1227
01:15:21,723 --> 01:15:23,020
l'm not a good leader, my skills are...

1228
01:15:23,039 --> 01:15:24,973
You idiot. This is not about skills.

1229
01:15:24,964 --> 01:15:26,864
This competition is about showmanship.

1230
01:15:26,856 --> 01:15:29,723
Your choreography is going to win it for us.

1231
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:33,207
Don't you know you're more creative than me?

1232
01:15:33,145 --> 01:15:35,875
Why else would l bother to put you down?

1233
01:15:36,226 --> 01:15:40,060
Carson, you've got it. You always have.

1234
01:15:40,845 --> 01:15:43,643
But for the Shets' sake, now you gotta bring it.

1235
01:15:43,605 --> 01:15:46,233
Hey, it's your year, remember?

1236
01:15:46,204 --> 01:15:48,604
No, Brooke, it's our year.

1237
01:16:11,422 --> 01:16:12,719
All right, you guys, this is it.

1238
01:16:12,737 --> 01:16:13,965
Just stay tight and lock out.

1239
01:16:13,988 --> 01:16:15,512
Okay. On three.

1240
01:16:16,588 --> 01:16:17,885
One, two, three.

1241
01:16:17,903 --> 01:16:19,131
Shets!

1242
01:16:23,486 --> 01:16:25,750
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1243
01:16:26,245 --> 01:16:27,678
Yeah. Hey.

1244
01:16:32,502 --> 01:16:34,402
Yeah! Great job!

1245
01:16:35,806 --> 01:16:39,708
And now for our last performance of the day,

1246
01:16:39,624 --> 01:16:45,187
from Camp Spirit Thunder, rising from the ashes of both coasts,

1247
01:16:45,046 --> 01:16:47,879
here are the Shets!

1248
01:17:02,211 --> 01:17:04,736
Don't worry, skids, l checked your marks.

1249
01:17:04,714 --> 01:17:06,204
Just catch me, okay.

1250
01:17:06,222 --> 01:17:07,348
Cradle.

1251
01:17:07,922 --> 01:17:09,412
All set, Penn.

1252
01:18:34,679 --> 01:18:35,805
Cradle.

1253
01:18:37,502 --> 01:18:39,402
Told you l'd catch you.

1254
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:47,886
Yes, yes. Yes, yes!

1255
01:21:24,791 --> 01:21:26,122
We did it!

1256
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:34,519
That's what l'm talking about. Give me some.

1257
01:21:34,513 --> 01:21:36,140
Some what?

1258
01:21:36,149 --> 01:21:38,379
Okay. All right. Yeah!

1259
01:21:38,363 --> 01:21:42,527
As always, Cheer Camp Championships deliver, huh? Let's hear you.

1260
01:21:42,438 --> 01:21:44,406
We'll have to wait for the judges to score

1261
01:21:44,395 --> 01:21:46,295
because this one's going to be close.

1262
01:21:47,347 --> 01:21:49,076
Too close. Yeah.

1263
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:51,105
Now is a really bad time to be cursed.

1264
01:21:52,063 --> 01:21:54,896
You know what? Who cares if we're cursed?

1265
01:21:54,855 --> 01:21:58,018
Getting cursed may have been the best thing that's ever happened to us.

1266
01:21:57,966 --> 01:22:00,400
Without this curse, we would have never become this team,

1267
01:22:00,373 --> 01:22:02,307
and hit a stunt that's never been done before.

1268
01:22:02,298 --> 01:22:04,289
l mean, that was amazing.

1269
01:22:04,737 --> 01:22:07,467
I have the results right here.

1270
01:22:07,431 --> 01:22:10,127
I'll be reading third place, apparently.

1271
01:22:10,095 --> 01:22:13,929
In third place, representing South Dakota, the Prairie Dogs.

1272
01:22:14,779 --> 01:22:16,406
Way to go, Dogs.

1273
01:22:17,409 --> 01:22:20,003
Look, we all gave 100%, and we trust each other.

1274
01:22:19,977 --> 01:22:23,242
Who cares about some stupid old trophy and world tour?

1275
01:22:23,185 --> 01:22:26,450
Coming in at second place,

1276
01:22:26,393 --> 01:22:28,384
the Flamingos!

1277
01:22:29,538 --> 01:22:30,562
Oh, my God!

1278
01:22:30,596 --> 01:22:33,224
All right. So that means the winning squad

1279
01:22:33,196 --> 01:22:35,255
that will represent the United States

1280
01:22:35,313 --> 01:22:37,406
on a Cheer Exhibition World Tour

1281
01:22:37,399 --> 01:22:40,960
is the East-West Shets!

1282
01:22:42,564 --> 01:22:44,156
Brooke, l meant what l said. l know.

1283
01:22:44,168 --> 01:22:45,795
lt's just... We freaking won!

1284
01:22:45,805 --> 01:22:46,829
l know.

1285
01:22:47,986 --> 01:22:50,250
Pepper, got something for you.

1286
01:22:50,232 --> 01:22:51,927
My spirit stick.

1287
01:22:51,933 --> 01:22:53,560
Vance, l knew it was you all along.

1288
01:22:53,569 --> 01:22:55,560
But why? You don't even believe in it.

1289
01:22:55,558 --> 01:22:56,684
No, but you do.

1290
01:22:56,906 --> 01:22:59,170
Besides, the stupid stick didn't work in the first place.

1291
01:22:59,151 --> 01:23:00,914
Pepper. Maybe it did.

1292
01:23:00,917 --> 01:23:02,646
We broke the curse.

1293
01:23:03,611 --> 01:23:06,011
You sure did. Congratulations.

1294
01:23:05,985 --> 01:23:08,579
No more curse! No more curse!

1295
01:23:08,553 --> 01:23:12,080
No more curse! No more curse!

1296
01:23:12,017 --> 01:23:13,848
No more curse!

1297
01:23:14,424 --> 01:23:15,618
Carson.

1298
01:23:35,471 --> 01:23:37,530
Boy walk in the spot, he's so fresh

1299
01:23:37,525 --> 01:23:39,516
He got what he needs to impressin'

1300
01:23:39,514 --> 01:23:41,573
just look at the way that he dressin'

1301
01:23:41,567 --> 01:23:43,558
Ain't no question chicks like oh

1302
01:23:43,557 --> 01:23:45,616
Girl walkin' the spot, she stop traffic

1303
01:23:45,610 --> 01:23:47,635
She's blowing your mind with her asset

1304
01:23:47,631 --> 01:23:51,533
So jessica Alba fantastic Instant classic boys like oh

1305
01:23:51,546 --> 01:23:53,343
Maybe I can see us moving like that

1306
01:23:53,406 --> 01:23:55,203
Maybe I can see us touching like that

1307
01:23:55,203 --> 01:23:57,398
