1
00:00:31,366 --> 00:00:33,129
East Coast!West Coast!

2
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,927
East Coast!West Coast!

3
00:00:34,928 --> 00:00:36,623
East Coast!West Coast!

4
00:00:36,628 --> 00:00:38,391
East Coast!West Coast!

5
00:00:38,392 --> 00:00:39,723
East Coast!

6
00:00:40,446 --> 00:00:43,643
How does if feel to be the centerfold for losers?

7
00:00:44,424 --> 00:00:46,688
Not this year.Sharks all the way.

8
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,103
Yeah.

9
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:50,379
Just because you shanks go all the way...

10
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,884
What?

11
00:00:52,671 --> 00:00:54,798
...doesn't mean your team will.

12
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:00,245
Boys.

13
00:01:03,002 --> 00:01:05,232
One, two, three, four.

14
00:01:05,215 --> 00:01:07,240
''J'' to the ''E'' to the ''T'' to the ''S''

15
00:01:07,237 --> 00:01:09,535
jets kick ass from east to west

16
00:01:09,515 --> 00:01:14,043
All you do is shake your butts Cheer 101 for stupid sluts

17
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,558
We're the West Coast Sharks And we got bite

18
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:19,902
We got what it takes to win this fight

19
00:01:19,878 --> 00:01:22,073
jets, you stiff,you dull, you old

20
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,221
Your moves and motions leave us cold

21
00:01:24,948 --> 00:01:29,476
Carson, captain of their team A loser even in her dreams

22
00:01:33,546 --> 00:01:35,810
You said it all,except one hitch

23
00:01:35,856 --> 00:01:38,120
She's a stuck-up, nasty,stupid little witch

24
00:01:38,102 --> 00:01:40,400
You girls think that you're ahead

25
00:01:40,444 --> 00:01:42,742
Our mascot's moves will knock you dead!

26
00:02:19,619 --> 00:02:21,177
l am so psyched!

27
00:02:21,993 --> 00:02:24,928
No, really. This time it wasn't a nightmare.

28
00:02:25,394 --> 00:02:26,588
Busted.

29
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,307
Damn! We're gonna have some fun.

30
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,423
Fun? We're not here to have fun, Ruben.We're here to win.

31
00:03:05,372 --> 00:03:08,205
Do you think East Coast is here to have fun?Hell, no! So, no fun.

32
00:03:08,163 --> 00:03:11,132
Okay. l won't use the ''F'' word anymore.

33
00:03:11,082 --> 00:03:14,051
Look, this year we're taking the title and going on the world tour.

34
00:03:14,003 --> 00:03:15,265
Hell to the yeah!

35
00:03:15,285 --> 00:03:17,583
Let's bust some East Coast attitude!

36
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:20,431
Reality check.The Jets have beat us three years in a row.

37
00:03:20,388 --> 00:03:21,946
What's your problem,doom cookie?

38
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,396
No problem. Let the disemboweling begin!

39
00:03:27,927 --> 00:03:29,360
Dibs on their entrails!

40
00:03:31,777 --> 00:03:35,508
Cheer TV is live at the Hard Rock Hotel at Universal Orlando.

41
00:03:35,435 --> 00:03:38,063
And l'm here with Pepper Driscoll and Vance Voorhees,

42
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:40,501
owners of the two rival cheer camps.

43
00:03:40,472 --> 00:03:42,372
Pepper, can you tell us a little bit about

44
00:03:42,365 --> 00:03:44,230
the All Star Cheer Camp Championships?

45
00:03:44,226 --> 00:03:47,286
l'd love to. Well, this year is extra special,

46
00:03:47,242 --> 00:03:50,075
because the winning squad will represent our great nation

47
00:03:50,034 --> 00:03:51,899
on a Cheer Exhibition World Tour.

48
00:03:51,894 --> 00:03:53,088
That's right.

49
00:03:53,114 --> 00:03:56,140
And my teams will come in at least first and second place again.

50
00:03:57,156 --> 00:03:59,351
Pepper's camp has both champion squads

51
00:03:59,338 --> 00:04:02,307
that epitomize the clash in American cheer styles.

52
00:04:02,804 --> 00:04:04,772
In fact, last year,one of her squads,

53
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,456
the East Coast jets,with their traditional cheer moves

54
00:04:07,616 --> 00:04:09,914
narrowly defeated the West Coast Sharks,

55
00:04:09,894 --> 00:04:11,828
another one of Pepper's squads shown here

56
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,684
with their new wave dance styling

57
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,205
inspired by music video choreography.

58
00:04:16,503 --> 00:04:18,664
ln the cheer world,the controversy is brewing over

59
00:04:18,653 --> 00:04:22,953
what exactly defines cheerleading,precision or flavor.

60
00:04:22,856 --> 00:04:24,414
Speaking of controversy,Vance,

61
00:04:24,428 --> 00:04:26,419
is the bad blood between your Camp Victory

62
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:28,385
and Pepper's Camp Spirit Thunder

63
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:29,774
related to your divorce?

64
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:32,474
Of course not.We're both professionals,

65
00:04:32,482 --> 00:04:34,074
and we handle our craft seriously.

66
00:04:34,085 --> 00:04:35,382
Which is why l can say that, this year,

67
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:37,460
a Camp Victory team will vanquish all comers.

68
00:04:37,455 --> 00:04:39,889
By vanquish he means third again.

69
00:04:39,861 --> 00:04:42,796
No, this year Camp Victory has a secret weapon.

70
00:04:42,748 --> 00:04:44,716
Bulltwinkle, you do not.

71
00:04:44,705 --> 00:04:47,037
We do, and l guess you're gonna have to wait and see.

72
00:04:47,016 --> 00:04:50,543
Well, we'll all see in this Saturday's World Cheer Exhibition

73
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,448
right here on Cheer TV.

74
00:05:13,871 --> 00:05:15,270
All right, after everybody unpacks,

75
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:16,647
we need to practice our home routine.

76
00:05:16,662 --> 00:05:17,856
We just got here.

77
00:05:17,881 --> 00:05:19,348
Yeah, and if we want to leave here winners,

78
00:05:19,356 --> 00:05:21,449
it's going to take practice, practice and more practice.

79
00:05:21,442 --> 00:05:22,568
And after that...

80
00:05:22,597 --> 00:05:23,791
Oh, my God. Carson.

81
00:05:23,816 --> 00:05:26,011
l'm, like, so glad you came back this year.

82
00:05:25,998 --> 00:05:28,125
Hey, Brooke,of course we came back.

83
00:05:28,115 --> 00:05:31,744
After losing to us three years in a row,it's, like, so brave.

84
00:05:31,677 --> 00:05:33,804
Yo! Can we burn this Least Coast trash?

85
00:05:33,794 --> 00:05:36,160
You know what?They're not even worth it, Aeysha.

86
00:05:36,137 --> 00:05:38,298
Give it up, Brooke.We're not gonna play like that.

87
00:05:38,287 --> 00:05:40,551
Oh, you mean like champions?

88
00:05:41,142 --> 00:05:43,440
Yeah. Not really your thing, huh?

89
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,354
Practice in 10 minutes!

90
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,334
Ta-ta.

91
00:05:46,403 --> 00:05:49,702
We're from the West Coast The mighty, mighty West Coast

92
00:05:49,645 --> 00:05:52,978
We ain't got no fear We're the best,it's our year!

93
00:05:52,917 --> 00:05:56,045
W-E-S-T,West Coast can't be beat!

94
00:05:55,997 --> 00:05:58,830
l think it's time for a little guerilla warfare.

95
00:05:58,789 --> 00:06:01,553
Brooke, where are we gonna find gorillas?

96
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:03,775
Just follow my lead.

97
00:06:03,794 --> 00:06:06,194
All right, you guys,spread out. Give it flavor.

98
00:06:06,168 --> 00:06:08,033
Five, six, seven, eight.

99
00:06:08,029 --> 00:06:11,692
One, two, four,five and six,seven and eight.

100
00:06:11,623 --> 00:06:15,252
One, two, and four,five and six, seven and eight.

101
00:06:15,183 --> 00:06:17,515
One and two...lgnore them!

102
00:06:17,494 --> 00:06:19,553
Six, seven, eight. Hey, girls.

103
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,672
Oh, hell, no.

104
00:06:20,702 --> 00:06:22,033
Oh, shit.

105
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,347
She's gonna go throw down.

106
00:06:24,488 --> 00:06:25,546
Yo, Paris Hilton.

107
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:27,570
lf you and this little purse dog of yours

108
00:06:27,568 --> 00:06:29,934
ever pull that skanky East Coast mess again,

109
00:06:29,911 --> 00:06:31,572
l will slice you like government cheese!

110
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:33,171
Aeysha, give it a rest.Give it a rest.

111
00:06:33,183 --> 00:06:34,707
l swear to you l will...

112
00:06:34,723 --> 00:06:36,486
l didn't know the government made cheese.

113
00:06:36,488 --> 00:06:38,217
She better watch her back.

114
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,634
What?

115
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:42,092
You go, girl.

116
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,933
You know what?l need to rework that transition, anyway,

117
00:06:44,926 --> 00:06:47,622
so free time until opening ceremonies.

118
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:18,263
Whoa.

119
00:07:20,347 --> 00:07:21,814
Hey, are you okay?

120
00:07:21,823 --> 00:07:23,120
l'm fine.

121
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:25,232
You kind of got skid marks.

122
00:07:25,738 --> 00:07:28,901
Good. Now the police can track down the stroller.

123
00:07:29,106 --> 00:07:31,040
Hey, why do l feel like l've met you before?

124
00:07:31,031 --> 00:07:32,965
l don't know.Maybe in a prior life.

125
00:07:32,956 --> 00:07:36,722
Well, l was thinking this one, but now that sounds whack.

126
00:07:36,871 --> 00:07:38,270
So, where are you from?

127
00:07:38,283 --> 00:07:41,218
California. A place called Eden Hills. You?

128
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,797
Nowhere and everywhere.

129
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,531
You know,l'm an army brat.

130
00:07:44,539 --> 00:07:46,166
l guess l'm just a regular brat.

131
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,867
l've never been out of the country.

132
00:07:47,876 --> 00:07:49,503
We just moved back from London.

133
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:51,810
Really?We're going there soon.

134
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,758
Oh, you're gonna love England.

135
00:07:53,748 --> 00:07:55,511
You know me so well.Oh, no doubt.

136
00:07:55,512 --> 00:07:56,979
Because, you know,in our prior life,

137
00:07:56,988 --> 00:07:58,615
when we were guards at Buckingham Palace,

138
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,957
you were that hottie wearing that bearskin hat.

139
00:08:00,934 --> 00:08:02,834
Of course, all the guards were trying to hook up with you.

140
00:08:02,828 --> 00:08:04,318
Oh, right, let me guess.

141
00:08:04,335 --> 00:08:05,802
You defended my honor.

142
00:08:05,811 --> 00:08:08,336
No, l was trying to get at you, too.

143
00:08:08,603 --> 00:08:10,070
Hey, you ever done the Double-Dragon?

144
00:08:10,078 --> 00:08:11,511
What?

145
00:08:16,046 --> 00:08:18,344
Right. l got to go.

146
00:08:18,324 --> 00:08:19,814
Hey, hold up, skids.

147
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,629
What if l want to see you again?

148
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:26,730
Number?

149
00:08:26,762 --> 00:08:31,859
916-555-0198.

150
00:08:36,035 --> 00:08:38,560
Cool. Now, l got your number, skids.

151
00:08:38,538 --> 00:08:39,869
lt's Carson.

152
00:08:39,885 --> 00:08:41,182
lt's Penn.

153
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:49,384
lf you need help wiping that off...

154
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,254
Just so you know,l'm not mad anymore.

155
00:08:54,227 --> 00:08:56,593
l MySpaced it all out of my system.

156
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:59,834
Now, hurry up,or we're gonna be late for the opening ceremony.

157
00:08:59,777 --> 00:09:02,575
Why him? Why now?

158
00:09:02,537 --> 00:09:03,799
Why who?

159
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,947
Aeysha,l met this guy.

160
00:09:05,938 --> 00:09:08,600
What? l wasn't even sure you remember what guys were.

161
00:09:08,569 --> 00:09:10,161
His name is Penn and he's so...

162
00:09:10,172 --> 00:09:11,696
Carson, breathe.

163
00:09:12,097 --> 00:09:13,792
He's awesome and smart,but in a good way.

164
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:15,232
And he's hot,caliente hot.

165
00:09:15,242 --> 00:09:17,767
Aeysha, l want to lick his abs.

166
00:09:17,745 --> 00:09:18,871
But you didn't, right?

167
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,924
No!

168
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:23,644
l need to stay focused,that means no cute boys.

169
00:09:24,065 --> 00:09:26,625
Right now,beating the Jets is my top priority.

170
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,658
And you're doing the right thing.

171
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,714
l know.

172
00:09:28,749 --> 00:09:30,444
So, can l have him?

173
00:09:36,194 --> 00:09:37,525
Ooh, Penn looks hot.

174
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:38,667
Just don't.

175
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:43,994
What do you mean?

176
00:09:44,022 --> 00:09:45,649
l like your hair that way, Chelsea.

177
00:09:45,658 --> 00:09:46,784
Oh, it's this new gel.

178
00:09:46,813 --> 00:09:49,338
My hair always looks better when there's something sticky in it.

179
00:09:50,984 --> 00:09:52,849
All right.Who is she?

180
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,414
What?

181
00:09:54,449 --> 00:09:56,076
The girl who's making you stupid.

182
00:09:56,246 --> 00:09:58,009
All right.Check it out.l met her today

183
00:09:58,011 --> 00:09:59,740
when l was running.Her name's...

184
00:09:59,743 --> 00:10:00,767
Carson!Carson!

185
00:10:00,802 --> 00:10:02,429
Right.Wrong.

186
00:10:02,438 --> 00:10:03,564
She's a Shark.

187
00:10:03,594 --> 00:10:04,686
She's the frigging captain of the Sharks.

188
00:10:04,717 --> 00:10:06,014
And what did she say?What did she want?

189
00:10:06,032 --> 00:10:07,260
Did she ask about our routines?

190
00:10:07,283 --> 00:10:08,511
Yeah, right.

191
00:10:08,534 --> 00:10:10,297
Cheering was the last thing we talked about.

192
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:12,199
Penn, she's like your sworn emeny.

193
00:10:12,192 --> 00:10:13,682
l swear it.

194
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:16,344
Trust me.She's not my enemy.

195
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:25,641
Penn, you need to know.

196
00:10:25,636 --> 00:10:28,036
Carson's a two-faced,back-biting,man-eating Shark!

197
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:30,001
Yeah. And guys hate biters.

198
00:10:29,998 --> 00:10:31,260
Why are you guys busting on me?

199
00:10:31,282 --> 00:10:32,749
Because you don't get it.

200
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:35,124
Yeah. l think l do.

201
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:39,890
Don't flatter yourself, Penn.

202
00:10:39,881 --> 00:10:42,281
This is about our team,about winning.

203
00:10:42,256 --> 00:10:43,553
So now what, Captain?

204
00:10:43,571 --> 00:10:45,368
Are you gonna forbid me from seeing Carson?

205
00:10:45,367 --> 00:10:46,459
l would never do that.

206
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,788
Good, 'cause it wouldn't work.

207
00:10:53,998 --> 00:10:56,125
He can't date a Shark!

208
00:10:56,116 --> 00:10:59,711
Duh, Chelsea.Watch and learn.

209
00:11:06,479 --> 00:11:09,676
Thank you.Thank you.Thank you.

210
00:11:09,623 --> 00:11:10,783
Hi, everybody.

211
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,937
Welcome to Camp Spirit Thunder.

212
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:18,924
This year,we're so proud to welcome

213
00:11:18,895 --> 00:11:21,261
a new member to our family, okay.

214
00:11:21,238 --> 00:11:22,728
l heard she's really tough.

215
00:11:22,746 --> 00:11:27,080
Give a big Spirit welcome to our new choreographer,Chicago.

216
00:11:26,981 --> 00:11:28,846
Come on up here, girl.

217
00:11:33,782 --> 00:11:35,841
All right, all eyes on me.

218
00:11:35,836 --> 00:11:38,270
Now, I want you all to remember this gorgeous face,

219
00:11:38,242 --> 00:11:40,608
'cause it will haunt you in your sleep.

220
00:11:40,585 --> 00:11:42,246
Now, I believe in hard work.

221
00:11:42,253 --> 00:11:43,845
Winning knows no pain.

222
00:11:43,858 --> 00:11:47,123
So, when I say jump,I wanna hear, ''How high?''

223
00:11:47,066 --> 00:11:48,226
Now jump.

224
00:11:48,253 --> 00:11:49,379
How high?

225
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:50,898
That's what I'm talking about.

226
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,349
Don't hate the player, baby.

227
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,411
Okay, seriously,Cheerzilla is a little scary.

228
00:11:56,659 --> 00:11:59,150
What? l love her.

229
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:02,361
She's the kind of black woman gay men emulate.She's amazing.

230
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:08,245
Welcome your cheer-tastic 2008 Spirit Thunder instructors!

231
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:14,461
Come on, guys.

232
00:12:19,921 --> 00:12:21,320
That was really great.

233
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,722
Yeah! Aren't they terrific?

234
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,424
Aren't they wonderful?

235
00:12:56,111 --> 00:12:57,601
Yeah!

236
00:12:58,358 --> 00:12:59,586
All right.

237
00:12:59,609 --> 00:13:05,377
And now, as you know,we have a very special tradition here

238
00:13:05,223 --> 00:13:08,158
at Camp Spirit Thunder.

239
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,490
This spirit stick was given to me

240
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:16,098
by the father of cheerleading himself,

241
00:13:16,068 --> 00:13:17,797
Herkie Herkimer.

242
00:13:17,801 --> 00:13:21,794
It embodies the heart and the soul of cheerleading,

243
00:13:21,715 --> 00:13:25,116
and it brings the luck of the cheer spirits.

244
00:13:25,052 --> 00:13:28,488
So, each team will be able to experience

245
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:31,821
its powerful aura for one night.

246
00:13:34,902 --> 00:13:35,926
That's right.

247
00:13:35,961 --> 00:13:40,955
And last year's winners of the Championships will have the honors first,

248
00:13:40,837 --> 00:13:42,634
the East Coast jets.

249
00:13:47,415 --> 00:13:48,848
Go get it.What?

250
00:13:48,859 --> 00:13:50,724
Come on.You do it. Go.What?

251
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,209
just a warning.

252
00:13:52,228 --> 00:13:57,063
Lose the stick and you will face the wrath of the cheer gods.

253
00:13:56,943 --> 00:14:01,209
I once knew a cheerleader who misplaced the stick for just one day

254
00:14:01,115 --> 00:14:02,844
and she broke her leg doing a simple toe touch.

255
00:14:02,848 --> 00:14:04,110
Wait for it.

256
00:14:04,131 --> 00:14:05,393
So guard it with your lives, people.

257
00:14:05,414 --> 00:14:06,608
Wait for it.

258
00:14:06,633 --> 00:14:09,966
You will find good fortune while it's in your possession, jets.

259
00:14:15,296 --> 00:14:16,888
Cheer smackdown.

260
00:14:17,735 --> 00:14:19,430
Words, shorty.Use your words.

261
00:14:19,435 --> 00:14:20,527
Him.

262
00:14:20,783 --> 00:14:22,341
Abs Penn.

263
00:14:23,157 --> 00:14:24,215
Go jets.

264
00:14:24,247 --> 00:14:26,238
Oh, girl.You know a cheer Crip

265
00:14:26,237 --> 00:14:28,205
can't be hitting it with a cheer Blood.

266
00:14:29,542 --> 00:14:34,002
All right. Everybody have a fun and safe week here at Camp Spirit Thunder!

267
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:39,826
You're a Jet?

268
00:14:39,841 --> 00:14:40,899
Yeah, that's a trip, huh?

269
00:14:40,932 --> 00:14:41,921
Why didn't you tell me?

270
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:44,427
What, that l was a male cheerleader?

271
00:14:44,397 --> 00:14:46,695
Sure. That's a real panty-dropper!

272
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:48,838
Look, l didn't mean any...

273
00:14:48,857 --> 00:14:50,484
Did Brooke tell you to play me?

274
00:14:50,493 --> 00:14:52,256
Sucks to be you, huh?

275
00:14:52,868 --> 00:14:54,699
Carson, l didn't know you were a cheerleader.

276
00:14:54,696 --> 00:14:56,254
Like...And what's the big deal?

277
00:14:56,268 --> 00:14:57,792
l'm a Jet. So what?

278
00:14:57,808 --> 00:14:58,900
So what?

279
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:01,991
l cannot have an inter-cheeracial relationship!

280
00:15:04,385 --> 00:15:05,443
Hello?

281
00:15:05,477 --> 00:15:06,569
Greetings,Camp Spirit Thunder.

282
00:15:06,599 --> 00:15:08,794
just a friendly video postcard from Camp Victory.

283
00:15:08,781 --> 00:15:11,409
Looking very forward to seeing you in the Championships.

284
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,245
We've got a secret weapon this year.

285
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,504
Say, Pepper, how many of your kids can throw

286
00:15:15,487 --> 00:15:18,650
a roundoff, back handspring double-fold twist?

287
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:19,827
Oh, none?

288
00:15:20,973 --> 00:15:22,907
Meet the new and improved Flamingos.

289
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:24,764
See you at the...

290
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:26,192
The Flamingos?

291
00:15:26,203 --> 00:15:27,830
They can barely stand on one leg.

292
00:15:29,347 --> 00:15:32,043
Everybody,it is all right.

293
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:36,310
Vance Voorhees is just trying to psyche us out.Okay?

294
00:15:36,213 --> 00:15:39,341
And it didn't work last year, and it's not gonna work this year.

295
00:15:39,293 --> 00:15:41,056
We always win.

296
00:15:41,122 --> 00:15:42,919
Nothing's gonna stop us this week.

297
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:44,978
Except the Sharks.

298
00:15:44,972 --> 00:15:47,236
Your little trick's not gonna work, Brooke.

299
00:15:47,219 --> 00:15:49,187
Making sure l knew Penn was a Jet

300
00:15:49,175 --> 00:15:51,075
makes it that much easier to resist him.

301
00:15:52,288 --> 00:15:54,483
l'm no player,but l thought l had a little game.

302
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,405
Sorry, Penn,but l've only got one thing on my mind,

303
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:59,723
and that is crushing your squad.

304
00:16:00,983 --> 00:16:03,315
Not even in your dreams, Carson.

305
00:16:03,998 --> 00:16:06,057
We're done here.Let's go.

306
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,268
Hey, can you go on spiritaccessories.com

307
00:16:16,255 --> 00:16:19,315
and see if they have the key chains that light up?

308
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:24,306
lf pink is the new black,what's the new pink?

309
00:16:24,244 --> 00:16:26,576
Aeysha, l'm trying to work here.

310
00:16:27,388 --> 00:16:30,755
l have to find a killer stunt that'll knock East Coast on their spanks.

311
00:16:30,693 --> 00:16:31,887
Sorry.

312
00:16:33,131 --> 00:16:34,723
lt doesn't matter.

313
00:16:34,736 --> 00:16:36,294
l can't concentrate anyway.

314
00:16:41,024 --> 00:16:44,926
Hey, you need to get serious, 'cause l don't care how cute he is,

315
00:16:44,842 --> 00:16:46,935
we are here to win, right?

316
00:16:46,928 --> 00:16:48,623
True that, sister, yo.

317
00:16:49,527 --> 00:16:52,860
Girl, go to sleep.Tomorrow is gonna be fun.

318
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,414
Five, six, seven, eight.

319
00:17:05,408 --> 00:17:08,900
Come on.My granny can jump higher than that from her grave.

320
00:17:08,841 --> 00:17:11,241
...seven, eight, one.

321
00:17:11,216 --> 00:17:13,116
Okay, Sarah,you're up.

322
00:17:13,108 --> 00:17:14,939
Let's have a little spirit this time.

323
00:17:15,547 --> 00:17:19,608
1st and 10,do it again. Go, go

324
00:17:19,526 --> 00:17:21,221
All right, Ruben,you're up.

325
00:17:21,226 --> 00:17:26,630
P-E-A-C-E.Peace to the Middle East Go, planet!

326
00:17:26,488 --> 00:17:27,955
He can't do that,can he?

327
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:31,365
l mean, if he cheers for peace, then the terrorists win! Duh!

328
00:17:41,086 --> 00:17:44,112
Showmanship.

329
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,061
That's what sells the performance.

330
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:49,757
So, I want everyone to give me big facials.

331
00:17:49,685 --> 00:17:51,585
Because you have to remember

332
00:17:51,578 --> 00:17:56,072
that points will be deducted for bad facials, okay?

333
00:17:59,247 --> 00:18:00,737
All right. All right,you guys, now.

334
00:18:00,754 --> 00:18:03,154
Any of those dance moves can be used in a cheer routine.

335
00:18:03,128 --> 00:18:05,119
Since when is dance a part of cheerleading,anyway?

336
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:08,781
Since the world first started recognizing that cheerleading was real.

337
00:18:08,711 --> 00:18:10,303
I mean, think about it, you guys.

338
00:18:10,315 --> 00:18:11,873
If you've got some dope cheerleading,

339
00:18:11,887 --> 00:18:13,286
you're throwing some hot dance moves

340
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:14,630
and you got some crazy tumbling.

341
00:18:14,647 --> 00:18:15,875
What do you have?

342
00:18:15,898 --> 00:18:17,058
You got a triple threat, right?

343
00:18:17,085 --> 00:18:19,417
Triple threat right here.

344
00:18:19,395 --> 00:18:20,657
Yo, I got this.

345
00:18:20,678 --> 00:18:22,373
Okay. Okay.Bring it, boo.

346
00:18:33,255 --> 00:18:35,280
Ain't like they can hang when a sister

347
00:18:35,277 --> 00:18:37,939
gets to cracking and popping her collarbone.

348
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,375
You smell me?

349
00:18:40,026 --> 00:18:42,187
What the hell are you doing?

350
00:18:43,363 --> 00:18:45,194
l'm keeping it real,sister.

351
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:46,658
Keeping it real for who?

352
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,158
You need to just be you, okay, boo?Just be you.

353
00:18:53,469 --> 00:18:54,959
I love it when we win

354
00:18:54,976 --> 00:18:57,809
The only thing that's better is when it's twice as long

355
00:18:57,768 --> 00:18:59,895
And I get a double-header

356
00:19:00,656 --> 00:19:02,021
Your cart.

357
00:19:06,046 --> 00:19:09,812
First of all, we're gonna start with happy,happy, happy.

358
00:19:09,736 --> 00:19:11,966
We're so happy to be here. Good.

359
00:19:11,949 --> 00:19:13,041
All right, now,surprise.

360
00:19:14,164 --> 00:19:17,691
What just happened?l don't know but it was wonderful.

361
00:19:17,628 --> 00:19:21,758
Uh-oh! Here comes the big wink for you in the back, judge.

362
00:19:21,671 --> 00:19:24,105
Big wink.There we go.

363
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:30,679
Come on, girl. Sunshine,I have seen better facials at a funeral

364
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,221
and l'm talking about the corpses.

365
00:19:33,189 --> 00:19:34,850
Oh, we like that,do we?

366
00:19:34,858 --> 00:19:36,120
Well, let's just make that smile...

367
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,168
Oh, gosh.Okay, all right.

368
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:41,648
Well, the workshop is over.

369
00:19:52,183 --> 00:19:54,310
Do just one facial.Come on.

370
00:19:54,975 --> 00:19:57,842
lf you hate cheerleading so much,why do you do it?

371
00:19:57,798 --> 00:19:59,390
For Satan.

372
00:19:59,403 --> 00:20:02,338
That's a shiny nugget I did not need to know.

373
00:20:02,611 --> 00:20:04,169
It's just like yoga, you know.

374
00:20:04,183 --> 00:20:05,673
It is.

375
00:20:09,189 --> 00:20:10,781
Satan is my car.

376
00:20:11,306 --> 00:20:15,436
My parents promised me payments and insurance if I join the squad.

377
00:20:15,349 --> 00:20:19,046
Well, my parents promised me a car if l stop cheerleading.

378
00:20:18,974 --> 00:20:22,637
And if I nail a girl, I get my own apartment.

379
00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:24,057
See, that was almost a facial.

380
00:20:24,076 --> 00:20:26,306
Yeah, in Transylvania.

381
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:27,517
Step off, Brooke.

382
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,508
Who are you?Her fairy Goth-mother?

383
00:20:29,498 --> 00:20:33,127
Brooke, get over yourself,and stop sweating my team.

384
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:35,289
Why would anyone listen to you?

385
00:20:35,273 --> 00:20:38,071
You suck as a gymnast and a captain, too.

386
00:20:38,546 --> 00:20:40,480
Cheer-off. Sharks!

387
00:20:40,471 --> 00:20:41,529
Yeah.

388
00:20:41,561 --> 00:20:43,552
Five, six, seven, eight.

389
00:20:43,551 --> 00:20:45,951
It don't matter what we do

390
00:20:45,925 --> 00:20:48,223
Music, baby, is our cue

391
00:20:48,203 --> 00:20:50,467
Hands and shoulders,face so tight

392
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:52,542
All our moves will rock this fight

393
00:20:52,535 --> 00:20:55,504
Our moves are tight,we lift with ease

394
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:58,321
The things we do will make you wheeze

395
00:20:58,278 --> 00:21:01,008
So watch us strike our muscle pose

396
00:21:00,972 --> 00:21:03,497
While you all prance and dosey-doe

397
00:21:03,475 --> 00:21:05,568
That was cute,your pose was dull

398
00:21:05,561 --> 00:21:07,995
But all of you have belly rolls

399
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,162
Once again we groove with flare

400
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:12,276
The moves we do,you wouldn't dare

401
00:21:12,266 --> 00:21:14,496
So listen quick while your face gets cracked

402
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,244
One, two, three, you're wack

403
00:21:16,245 --> 00:21:18,270
Your rhymes are fun, but we're still good

404
00:21:18,266 --> 00:21:20,427
We still can stunt,you're from the hood

405
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:22,748
Hood rats, good rats,what are you called?

406
00:21:22,726 --> 00:21:25,217
The moves you do won't win at all

407
00:21:25,196 --> 00:21:27,289
So listen quick, oops

408
00:21:27,282 --> 00:21:30,342
You said that rhyme One, two, three, our time

409
00:21:30,297 --> 00:21:33,061
Motions, motions,hear them roar

410
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,721
No one's knocking at your door

411
00:21:35,688 --> 00:21:37,849
With no rhythm and with no sass

412
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,897
All of you can kiss our ass

413
00:21:39,891 --> 00:21:42,086
Dance, 10, looks, 3

414
00:21:42,073 --> 00:21:44,564
The moves you do make us all pee

415
00:21:44,543 --> 00:21:47,239
We laugh, we cry,we all say hi

416
00:21:47,207 --> 00:21:49,869
'Cause when you dance,it's bye, bye, bye

417
00:21:49,838 --> 00:21:51,271
Bye, bye

418
00:21:51,281 --> 00:21:52,270
Bye.

419
00:21:52,308 --> 00:21:53,366
Bye. Have fun.

420
00:22:02,607 --> 00:22:03,938
Bye.

421
00:22:06,521 --> 00:22:08,580
Yo, that was shady,Brooke.

422
00:22:08,575 --> 00:22:10,770
Please, you totally popped a chubber.

423
00:22:10,757 --> 00:22:11,781
Hey, Brooke.

424
00:22:11,815 --> 00:22:12,804
What?

425
00:22:12,842 --> 00:22:14,901
You've got no clue,you're in the dark

426
00:22:14,895 --> 00:22:16,294
Wake up call,it's the year of the...

427
00:22:35,365 --> 00:22:36,798
Come on, babycakes.

428
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:40,712
If we all just imagine this world's a fabulous place, it'll happen.

429
00:22:41,942 --> 00:22:47,005
I see children frolicking under a rainbow eating hormone-free treats.

430
00:22:48,327 --> 00:22:50,022
A unicorn.

431
00:22:51,311 --> 00:22:57,272
l see mutant turtles gnawing on festering human flesh.

432
00:22:58,402 --> 00:22:59,391
da

433
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,709
They ate the unicorn.

434
00:23:03,663 --> 00:23:06,188
You need Jesus.Or Prozac.

435
00:23:07,707 --> 00:23:10,107
Thanks for trying to cheer me up, Ruben,

436
00:23:10,145 --> 00:23:12,545
but I'm more mad at myself than Brooke.

437
00:23:13,096 --> 00:23:14,757
I let her get to me.

438
00:23:14,765 --> 00:23:16,494
That's why we lost the cheer-off.

439
00:23:16,498 --> 00:23:18,523
Yeah, that bites.

440
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:20,608
You gonna finish that steak?

441
00:23:34,305 --> 00:23:37,069
Spirit to you.

442
00:23:38,636 --> 00:23:41,696
Hey, l heard you had kind of a rough day, huh?

443
00:23:41,652 --> 00:23:44,086
But your luck's about to change.

444
00:23:44,058 --> 00:23:45,855
Okay. All right.

445
00:23:45,855 --> 00:23:48,881
Oh, West Coast Sharks,may the luck of Herkie

446
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:51,808
smile on you as it has for me.

447
00:23:51,983 --> 00:23:53,473
Go Sharks

448
00:23:54,005 --> 00:23:55,529
Go Sharks

449
00:23:56,058 --> 00:23:57,525
Go Sharks

450
00:23:58,239 --> 00:23:59,797
Go Sharks

451
00:24:00,293 --> 00:24:01,920
Go Sharks

452
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:03,932
Go Sharks

453
00:24:04,624 --> 00:24:06,114
Go Sharks

454
00:24:06,646 --> 00:24:07,704
Go Sharks

455
00:24:11,298 --> 00:24:14,426
Okay, guys, we got to give props to the spirits,

456
00:24:14,506 --> 00:24:16,201
but isn't this a little extreme?

457
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:18,766
You know how nasty some cheerleaders can be when they're alive.

458
00:24:18,741 --> 00:24:20,936
Do you really want to risk the dead ones hating on you?

459
00:24:20,923 --> 00:24:24,017
Then let's do this right.Look, off.

460
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:31,525
Fire, water, earth,air, spirit stick.

461
00:24:32,473 --> 00:24:35,169
You know what this really needs to pop?

462
00:24:36,388 --> 00:24:38,253
The blood of a virgin.

463
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,361
Okay. Why are you guys looking at me?

464
00:24:44,377 --> 00:24:47,278
Come on, Carson, just a little pin prick.

465
00:24:47,233 --> 00:24:50,794
lf she can take a little prick, she wouldn't be a virgin.

466
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,234
You coming?

467
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:55,385
Hell to the yeah.

468
00:24:55,415 --> 00:24:56,541
Where?

469
00:24:56,569 --> 00:24:58,366
You wouldn't be into it.

470
00:24:58,366 --> 00:25:00,425
Cheer poker with the Prairie Dogs.

471
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,115
What's the buy-in?

472
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,917
Sarah, this is cheer poker.

473
00:25:03,917 --> 00:25:06,351
Sounds like easy pickings. Wait.

474
00:25:06,323 --> 00:25:08,348
Who's gonna guard the spirit stick?

475
00:25:10,655 --> 00:25:12,782
You know what? You guys go.

476
00:25:12,772 --> 00:25:15,240
l'm captain, l'll do stick duty.

477
00:25:15,211 --> 00:25:16,439
Thanks.Thanks, boo.

478
00:25:16,462 --> 00:25:17,827
What room is the poker game?

479
00:25:17,841 --> 00:25:19,832
Dumpy Dogs have a suite.

480
00:25:51,434 --> 00:25:52,662
Why can't I delete you?

481
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,045
Down here.

482
00:26:07,219 --> 00:26:08,277
Penn, what are you doing?

483
00:26:08,311 --> 00:26:09,710
Well, you don't answer my calls and texts,

484
00:26:09,722 --> 00:26:12,987
so l had to do it old school and show up in person.

485
00:26:13,347 --> 00:26:14,746
Don't make me serenade you.

486
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:16,454
Penn, you're a Jet. We can't...

487
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:19,190
I know. I know. Look,let's just do the rides.

488
00:26:19,155 --> 00:26:21,817
No cheer talk.I promise.

489
00:26:21,786 --> 00:26:23,014
The Double-Dragon?

490
00:26:23,037 --> 00:26:25,267
Now you're talking.I'll meet you.

491
00:26:26,021 --> 00:26:27,318
Cradle.

492
00:26:50,405 --> 00:26:51,929
That was sick!

493
00:26:52,587 --> 00:26:53,747
You had fun,didn't you?

494
00:26:53,774 --> 00:26:55,708
Hey! l know how to play, bro.

495
00:26:55,699 --> 00:26:56,757
Mmm-hmm.

496
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:59,953
What? l take cheering seriously.

497
00:26:59,902 --> 00:27:01,699
You know,my team's counting on me.

498
00:27:01,762 --> 00:27:03,593
l'm not gonna let them down.

499
00:27:03,591 --> 00:27:07,118
Word on the street? It's just summer camp.

500
00:27:07,057 --> 00:27:08,854
Yeah, maybe for you.

501
00:27:08,854 --> 00:27:10,685
We worked our butts off just to get here.

502
00:27:11,388 --> 00:27:12,514
So did we.

503
00:27:12,544 --> 00:27:15,069
And we had to raise a lot of money.

504
00:27:15,046 --> 00:27:17,810
You know, wet T-shirt car washes.

505
00:27:18,223 --> 00:27:20,350
Trust me. l know.

506
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,798
Anyways, winning a competition like this,

507
00:27:23,741 --> 00:27:26,710
it could really up my chance of getting a scholarship to college.

508
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,924
l even had to get a team scholarship just to get here.

509
00:27:28,907 --> 00:27:30,704
Yeah, so did l.

510
00:27:30,703 --> 00:27:33,194
You know, it's nothing to be ashamed of.

511
00:27:33,173 --> 00:27:34,470
In my case, it is.

512
00:27:34,489 --> 00:27:35,683
What do you mean?

513
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:39,446
Look, don't get all serious on me, skids.

514
00:27:39,462 --> 00:27:40,952
Come on.

515
00:27:44,435 --> 00:27:47,063
You fumbled on the flop We'll trick you on the turn

516
00:27:47,034 --> 00:27:49,867
Now here comes the river and the P-Dog burn!

517
00:27:49,826 --> 00:27:53,227
You Dogs think you can fool us Sharks at poker faces.

518
00:27:54,542 --> 00:27:57,375
You are so bluffing,Prairie Dog. I call.

519
00:27:57,334 --> 00:27:59,666
Trip cowboys.I beat that.

520
00:27:59,643 --> 00:28:02,669
How about my three bullets shoot down your cowboys?

521
00:28:02,627 --> 00:28:04,151
P-Dogs rule!

522
00:28:04,168 --> 00:28:06,898
Oh, yeah? How about a Texas titty twister on the house?

523
00:28:06,862 --> 00:28:09,695
Hey, what are you doing? Oh, no, what the...

524
00:28:09,653 --> 00:28:11,814
Go, go. Oh, no, we got them.

525
00:28:11,803 --> 00:28:13,168
We got his shorts.

526
00:28:15,782 --> 00:28:16,908
Look, shark.

527
00:28:19,343 --> 00:28:21,106
A world tour is no big deal to me.

528
00:28:21,108 --> 00:28:23,099
l've been overseas my whole life.

529
00:28:23,097 --> 00:28:26,464
Well, if you win again, you can get a cheer scholarship, too.

530
00:28:26,402 --> 00:28:27,960
To West Point?

531
00:28:28,841 --> 00:28:30,809
Okay, wait, why would you go there?

532
00:28:30,862 --> 00:28:32,853
You're a musician and a dancer.

533
00:28:34,038 --> 00:28:37,565
Yeah, well, my father is a son of immigrants,

534
00:28:37,503 --> 00:28:39,596
and they came from nothing.

535
00:28:39,588 --> 00:28:41,180
And after he made a career out of the military,

536
00:28:41,193 --> 00:28:42,626
he had everything.

537
00:28:42,636 --> 00:28:45,230
So, all his sons went to West Point.

538
00:28:45,204 --> 00:28:48,332
There's five of us, and well, I'm the last one.

539
00:28:48,444 --> 00:28:52,278
So, my parents, well, my father expects it.

540
00:28:52,198 --> 00:28:53,825
Well, can't you talk to him?

541
00:28:53,834 --> 00:28:56,826
I mean, won't he let you cheer somewhere else?

542
00:28:58,166 --> 00:29:00,031
Wait. He doesn't know?

543
00:29:00,379 --> 00:29:02,404
My dad would spew a colon.

544
00:29:02,946 --> 00:29:06,006
I kind of told him I joined the tae kwon do team.

545
00:29:07,438 --> 00:29:10,430
Can l tell you a secret,but just between us?

546
00:29:10,389 --> 00:29:11,515
Sure.

547
00:29:20,818 --> 00:29:22,217
What?

548
00:29:23,063 --> 00:29:26,760
Even though my family has money, I took a team scholarship

549
00:29:26,689 --> 00:29:31,058
because I didn't want him to find out about Cheer Camp.

550
00:29:31,694 --> 00:29:34,857
Wow. Well, does your team know?

551
00:29:38,207 --> 00:29:39,697
Weak, huh?

552
00:29:41,063 --> 00:29:44,032
So, where does your dad think you are now?

553
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:46,007
Extreme Warrior Martial Arts Camp.

554
00:29:46,068 --> 00:29:48,002
He watched me pack my nunchuks.

555
00:30:02,976 --> 00:30:05,274
Whoa, you sharks do stick together.

556
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:13,664
Yeah, get it, get it.

557
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,211
Move it. Come on, honey.

558
00:30:28,676 --> 00:30:30,371
Oh, go get Carson.

559
00:30:30,377 --> 00:30:32,242
Honey, that girl can wear a thong.

560
00:30:32,237 --> 00:30:33,898
Yeah, my girl needs to learn to hang.

561
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,631
But we need to take this show to my crib.

562
00:30:35,639 --> 00:30:37,266
She's guarding the stick there.

563
00:30:37,274 --> 00:30:39,765
Come on, you all, let's go. Let's go.

564
00:30:48,921 --> 00:30:50,752
Yo, Carson dipped out.

565
00:30:51,103 --> 00:30:52,832
And took the stick.

566
00:30:53,221 --> 00:30:54,449
Where?

567
00:30:55,274 --> 00:30:56,707
Maybe my girl learned to hang.

568
00:30:56,718 --> 00:30:58,686
Come on, let's go find her.

569
00:31:02,974 --> 00:31:05,636
You know, I should really get going.

570
00:31:05,605 --> 00:31:07,300
I just told you my darkest secret.

571
00:31:07,306 --> 00:31:09,206
Yeah, l know, but...

572
00:31:09,198 --> 00:31:13,726
Look, when was the last time you just danced for fun?

573
00:31:13,626 --> 00:31:16,618
Without being thrown in the air every few seconds?

574
00:31:17,541 --> 00:31:19,600
A bar mitzvah three years ago.

575
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,038
So, Jet boy thinks he can handle West Coast moves?

576
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,594
l think Shark girl's asking the wrong question.

577
00:32:24,052 --> 00:32:25,485
No, Carson wouldn't bring it here.

578
00:32:25,495 --> 00:32:26,792
Too many haters.

579
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:28,711
Where else can we look?

580
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,690
I think I have an idea.

581
00:32:33,228 --> 00:32:34,695
Carson!

582
00:32:56,714 --> 00:32:57,738
Oh, no.

583
00:32:57,773 --> 00:32:58,762
What?

584
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,700
I'm about to have a secret, too.

585
00:33:00,692 --> 00:33:02,023
Carson!

586
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:04,301
What are you guys doing here?

587
00:33:04,318 --> 00:33:06,843
Us? You need to check yourself.

588
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,378
We were just hanging out.

589
00:33:08,392 --> 00:33:10,792
Carson, give us back the spirit stick.

590
00:33:10,767 --> 00:33:13,565
You junk up its karma around here with all these civilians.

591
00:33:13,526 --> 00:33:14,788
Ruben, it's in our room.

592
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:16,004
No, it's not.

593
00:33:16,029 --> 00:33:19,123
Why do you think we're out here looking for you?

594
00:33:19,301 --> 00:33:22,668
Somebody jacked it, and now we know for sure who.

595
00:33:22,606 --> 00:33:23,903
Jets!

596
00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:28,096
jets kick ass from east to west

597
00:33:28,093 --> 00:33:30,391
And speaking of coincidence...

598
00:33:30,371 --> 00:33:32,236
You lost the spirit stick.

599
00:33:32,232 --> 00:33:34,393
Ooh! You Sharks are tuna.

600
00:33:34,381 --> 00:33:35,575
Just give it back.

601
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,660
Carson, this isn't a Jets prank.

602
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:40,083
l wouldn't scam you like this.

603
00:33:40,092 --> 00:33:42,026
Come on, Carson, it's just a big coincidence

604
00:33:42,017 --> 00:33:43,882
how he got you out of your room

605
00:33:43,878 --> 00:33:45,368
and then the spirit stick was stolen.

606
00:33:45,386 --> 00:33:48,947
Seems wrong he didn't tell you he was a Jet when he met you.

607
00:33:48,883 --> 00:33:50,817
That's right. This has cheer bitch's

608
00:33:50,808 --> 00:33:52,708
skanky paw prints all over it!

609
00:33:52,702 --> 00:33:54,260
Don't let them play us again, Carson.

610
00:33:54,274 --> 00:33:55,798
It's our year, remember?

611
00:33:55,813 --> 00:33:57,371
This is so whack.Look, Carson.

612
00:33:57,385 --> 00:33:59,376
l'll help you look for the stupid stick, all right?

613
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:00,706
What?Stupid stick?

614
00:34:00,722 --> 00:34:02,986
Yeah. l'll help you look, too.

615
00:34:03,803 --> 00:34:05,293
Look, don't get all crazy about this, okay?

616
00:34:05,311 --> 00:34:06,778
No, it's not okay.

617
00:34:06,787 --> 00:34:09,017
How can l trust someone who lies to his own team?

618
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,024
Carson.

619
00:34:10,059 --> 00:34:11,253
You know, he didn't need you guys

620
00:34:11,278 --> 00:34:12,973
to raise travel money for the trip.

621
00:34:12,978 --> 00:34:16,106
He was too scared to tell his dad about Cheer Camp.

622
00:34:16,059 --> 00:34:18,118
She's a liar,right, Penn?

623
00:34:20,968 --> 00:34:23,061
No, Brooke. l should have just believed you

624
00:34:23,054 --> 00:34:26,455
when you said Sharks and Jets were sworn enemies.

625
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:28,153
Now l know why.

626
00:34:28,186 --> 00:34:30,654
You showed your true colors, didn't you?

627
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:33,059
And you showed you're just a Jet.

628
00:34:35,085 --> 00:34:37,349
Have fun being cursed, losers.

629
00:34:39,897 --> 00:34:42,525
Hey, we sold candy bars for you, dude.

630
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:45,560
l'll pay you back the money, okay?

631
00:34:48,368 --> 00:34:50,893
But those Butterfingers were heavy.

632
00:34:54,528 --> 00:34:55,688
Hey, Pepper.

633
00:34:55,715 --> 00:34:57,410
Heard the Sharks totally lost the spirit stick.

634
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,469
What?

635
00:35:02,357 --> 00:35:03,381
Yeah, they're over there.

636
00:35:03,416 --> 00:35:04,508
Thank you. Thank you so much.

637
00:35:04,539 --> 00:35:05,801
See you.

638
00:35:16,474 --> 00:35:17,964
Uh-oh.

639
00:35:18,752 --> 00:35:23,121
So it's true. You lost my spirit stick.

640
00:35:23,019 --> 00:35:24,748
Pepper, I'm sorry. Look, I got distracted...

641
00:35:24,752 --> 00:35:27,585
Well, it was up to you to guard it with your lives.

642
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:28,874
We'll find it, Pepper.

643
00:35:28,891 --> 00:35:30,153
Oh, you better.

644
00:35:30,174 --> 00:35:32,734
Yeah, so, on the real, what happens if we don't?

645
00:35:32,709 --> 00:35:33,801
Oh, who knows?

646
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:36,299
You remember that cheerleader I was telling you about?

647
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,897
Well, after she broke her leg,

648
00:35:37,938 --> 00:35:40,930
her entire team got some kind of nasty stomach virus,

649
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:44,257
and they all vomited on the competition floor, all right?

650
00:35:44,195 --> 00:35:46,493
And, needless to say,everyone was happy

651
00:35:46,473 --> 00:35:48,703
to see them go home the next day,

652
00:35:48,687 --> 00:35:50,814
including the judges.

653
00:35:53,756 --> 00:35:56,247
Okay, stop! We are not cursed.

654
00:35:56,226 --> 00:35:57,887
Not even the spirit stick gods

655
00:35:57,895 --> 00:35:59,522
can take this victory away from us.

656
00:35:59,531 --> 00:36:01,362
We are going to win, damn it.

657
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,191
Pyramid, seven, eight.

658
00:36:03,189 --> 00:36:05,020
One, two, three and four, five, six...

659
00:36:05,018 --> 00:36:06,246
Hey.

660
00:36:07,553 --> 00:36:09,521
You guys, get up!

661
00:36:11,756 --> 00:36:13,986
This is one fast-acting curse.

662
00:36:14,355 --> 00:36:15,879
Hey!

663
00:36:54,621 --> 00:36:55,986
Damn curse.

664
00:37:11,754 --> 00:37:13,244
Are those the Sharks? Yeah.

665
00:37:14,481 --> 00:37:16,415
Don't let them touch you.

666
00:37:18,716 --> 00:37:20,775
Let the curse be with you!

667
00:37:28,598 --> 00:37:30,759
This is all the money l've got on me right now.

668
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,806
So l can give you the rest as soon as l can, all right?

669
00:37:33,763 --> 00:37:35,993
That's not what l care about.

670
00:37:40,117 --> 00:37:41,448
So, what's your deal, Penn?

671
00:37:41,464 --> 00:37:43,056
Do you want to be here or not?

672
00:37:43,068 --> 00:37:45,730
At this minute, not so much.

673
00:37:45,698 --> 00:37:46,858
l'm serious.

674
00:37:46,886 --> 00:37:48,786
We want to win.

675
00:37:48,779 --> 00:37:51,612
Now you know what kind of snakes those Sharks really are.

676
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:54,572
Yeah. They're like snarks.

677
00:37:55,132 --> 00:37:56,497
The enemy.

678
00:37:58,019 --> 00:37:59,611
Yeah, l get it, Chelsea.

679
00:37:59,624 --> 00:38:01,114
Do you?

680
00:38:01,132 --> 00:38:05,364
Look, l get it.You're not into me.Nothing's gonna happen.

681
00:38:06,393 --> 00:38:08,088
But it will happen for this team.

682
00:38:08,094 --> 00:38:11,086
And the only way it's gonna work is if we do this together.

683
00:38:11,046 --> 00:38:12,206
Yeah.

684
00:38:12,233 --> 00:38:15,168
So, you're like with us or what?

685
00:38:15,121 --> 00:38:18,579
''j'' to the ''E'' to the ''T'' to the ''S''

686
00:38:18,522 --> 00:38:21,582
jets kick ass from east to west!

687
00:38:21,537 --> 00:38:23,129
You know they stole the stick.

688
00:38:23,141 --> 00:38:26,577
lt don't matter who took it, we got to bust a cap in this curse.

689
00:38:26,511 --> 00:38:27,910
Even Ruben thinks so now.

690
00:38:27,922 --> 00:38:30,948
AEYSHA: You know what?l think it's time for Sarah to do her thing.

691
00:38:30,906 --> 00:38:34,637
A cheer sacrifice?Has it really come to that?

692
00:38:34,564 --> 00:38:37,931
Well, if it'll get us a win,we'll do it at midnight.

693
00:38:48,906 --> 00:38:52,103
O mighty fallen cheer angels,

694
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:54,746
we summon thee from darkness.

695
00:38:54,713 --> 00:38:56,681
We're sorry about your spirit stick,

696
00:38:56,670 --> 00:39:00,436
but shouldn't you be cursing the skanky succubae that stole it?

697
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,657
Not us.

698
00:39:02,638 --> 00:39:04,868
While you process our request,

699
00:39:04,851 --> 00:39:07,649
will you please accept our sacrifices?

700
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:09,636
Go, spirits!

701
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:13,986
lt wouldn't hurt.

702
00:39:26,958 --> 00:39:30,359
Girl! Your lucky strapless?

703
00:39:30,295 --> 00:39:32,729
lf you love something, set it free.

704
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:39,791
Oh, my God.The cheer spirits are here.

705
00:39:39,728 --> 00:39:41,696
They don't sound cheerful.

706
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,558
Maybe it was just the wind.

707
00:39:50,508 --> 00:39:52,840
That's for trying to get us cursed, freaks!

708
00:39:52,818 --> 00:39:54,217
Yeah, except that you don't deserve.

709
00:39:54,229 --> 00:39:57,096
Like we need to steal the spirit stick to win.

710
00:39:57,053 --> 00:40:00,454
You couldn't even beat me in a cheer-off, loser.

711
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:02,449
All right, that's it.You want a real battle?

712
00:40:02,443 --> 00:40:04,434
Sharks and Jets,right now.

713
00:40:04,432 --> 00:40:06,297
Fair fight. No contact.

714
00:40:06,293 --> 00:40:07,521
Cheer rumble!

715
00:40:07,545 --> 00:40:08,671
Let's go.

716
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,167
Yeah, let's go,you guys.Let's do this.

717
00:40:10,176 --> 00:40:12,371
Come on, you guys,go around the corner.

718
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:14,519
Come on, guys, let's go.

719
00:40:14,507 --> 00:40:15,599
Hey, snarks.

720
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,654
Bring it.

721
00:40:44,634 --> 00:40:45,760
Jets!

722
00:40:51,565 --> 00:40:52,793
Sharks!

723
00:40:58,495 --> 00:40:59,587
Jets!

724
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,187
Sharks!

725
00:41:17,393 --> 00:41:19,054
Pyramid! Higher!

726
00:41:42,772 --> 00:41:46,071
What happened tonight is an all-time,

727
00:41:46,012 --> 00:41:50,176
an all-time low for Camp Spirit Thunder!

728
00:41:50,086 --> 00:41:54,022
You've just ruined this camp's chances against Vance.

729
00:41:53,936 --> 00:41:55,426
And, even worse,

730
00:41:55,445 --> 00:41:57,242
you lost my spirit stick.

731
00:41:57,241 --> 00:41:59,209
Brooke, give Pepper back her spirit stick.

732
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:00,962
Hey, loser,if l had the stick,

733
00:42:00,964 --> 00:42:02,488
why would my team have gotten hurt?

734
00:42:02,503 --> 00:42:04,130
Because your team started the rumble.

735
00:42:04,171 --> 00:42:06,867
You don't even deserve...

736
00:42:06,835 --> 00:42:08,735
Enough!

737
00:42:08,727 --> 00:42:13,687
You kids have let down yourselves, your camp and your country.

738
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:14,870
Take a look around.

739
00:42:14,888 --> 00:42:18,051
Neither of you have enough team members to compete now.

740
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,298
So in the morning, when you get up,

741
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:23,507
there'll be buses here waiting to take you all home.

742
00:42:23,455 --> 00:42:24,786
Good night!

743
00:42:32,855 --> 00:42:36,689
Tomorrow, we need to whip those little Prairie Dogs into shape.

744
00:42:36,609 --> 00:42:39,806
Then girlfriend,you'd better pray for a miracle.

745
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,817
Let's just go home and pretend

746
00:43:16,811 --> 00:43:18,836
this whole sorry trip never happened.

747
00:43:22,907 --> 00:43:24,534
What a nightmare.

748
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:36,355
Where's the
spirit stick?

749
00:43:36,351 --> 00:43:38,911
Brooke, l know
you have it.

750
00:43:38,885 --> 00:43:41,547
You're still the rock star of stupid.

751
00:43:41,516 --> 00:43:43,711
Why would l keep the stick and stay cursed?

752
00:43:43,698 --> 00:43:45,689
Can we all just get over it?

753
00:43:45,687 --> 00:43:47,848
Even Paris and Nicole settled their...

754
00:43:47,837 --> 00:43:49,464
Shut up, Ruben!

755
00:43:52,361 --> 00:43:53,885
Pepper?

756
00:43:54,767 --> 00:44:00,763
Run! Flip! Jump high!You dissed the spirits,and die, die, die!

757
00:44:00,606 --> 00:44:02,164
Pepper, let go!

758
00:44:10,777 --> 00:44:12,677
What the hell?

759
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:14,297
Brooke didn't steal the spirit stick.

760
00:44:14,307 --> 00:44:16,400
She would've given it back by now to get rid of the curse.

761
00:44:16,392 --> 00:44:19,190
Whatever! She is still a sick individual.

762
00:44:19,151 --> 00:44:23,110
Now, just go to sleep.l don't need any more drama tonight, okay?

763
00:44:26,017 --> 00:44:30,147
But that means Penn had nothing to do with it, either.

764
00:44:59,064 --> 00:45:00,691
You guys,we can't leave like this.

765
00:45:00,701 --> 00:45:02,293
lt's like we're giving up.

766
00:45:02,305 --> 00:45:04,364
l promised you guys a win,

767
00:45:04,359 --> 00:45:06,987
and we're going to get one.

768
00:45:11,706 --> 00:45:13,003
Pretty.

769
00:45:19,278 --> 00:45:21,542
Brooke,l don't think you stole the spirit stick anymore.

770
00:45:21,524 --> 00:45:24,220
Like l give a flying tuck what you think.

771
00:45:24,219 --> 00:45:25,516
Well, l do think you want to win

772
00:45:25,534 --> 00:45:27,092
Camp Championships as much as l do.

773
00:45:27,107 --> 00:45:28,404
So what?

774
00:45:28,422 --> 00:45:29,889
Well, if there was any chance to stay and compete,

775
00:45:29,897 --> 00:45:31,330
you'd consider it, right?

776
00:45:31,341 --> 00:45:32,831
Even if it meant coming together.

777
00:45:33,138 --> 00:45:34,503
Ew! That's like cheer-cest!

778
00:45:34,517 --> 00:45:37,145
Chelsea, l meant combining our teams.

779
00:45:37,245 --> 00:45:38,837
Look, it's about not quitting.

780
00:45:38,849 --> 00:45:40,976
Pepper wants her camp to win,l think she'll help us.

781
00:45:40,967 --> 00:45:42,229
Brilliant plan, Carson.

782
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:44,445
Look, l think the Jets are already on the spirits' hit list.

783
00:45:44,432 --> 00:45:46,764
Because of you.

784
00:45:46,742 --> 00:45:50,610
Okay, well,if we leave now,we'll all stay cursed.

785
00:45:50,528 --> 00:45:52,120
Come on, Brooke.

786
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:58,513
Boo that, freak!We're out of here.

787
00:46:05,768 --> 00:46:06,860
Penn?

788
00:46:08,431 --> 00:46:11,093
Look, l'm sorry for...

789
00:46:11,062 --> 00:46:13,394
Well, it's kind of a long list.

790
00:46:15,073 --> 00:46:16,563
Later, Carson.

791
00:46:18,153 --> 00:46:20,018
You can call me skids!

792
00:46:25,821 --> 00:46:27,311
What?

793
00:46:27,329 --> 00:46:30,025
You wanted me to say yes to Hilary Duff light?

794
00:46:29,992 --> 00:46:31,391
Strap on a pair, Penn.

795
00:46:31,403 --> 00:46:32,768
Can l borrow yours?

796
00:46:32,783 --> 00:46:35,377
Don't even try to out-bitch me.

797
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:37,784
Yeah. Brooke's like the Olym-bitch champion.

798
00:46:37,756 --> 00:46:38,916
No doubt.

799
00:46:38,943 --> 00:46:40,501
l just never pegged you for a quitter.

800
00:46:40,515 --> 00:46:42,039
l'm not quitting, Penn.

801
00:46:42,056 --> 00:46:44,490
l'm embracing my future.

802
00:46:44,462 --> 00:46:46,259
Which is freaking bright!

803
00:46:46,259 --> 00:46:48,159
Everyone says so.

804
00:46:48,152 --> 00:46:50,450
They say a lot of other stuff about her, too, you know.

805
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:52,057
Shut up, Chelsea!

806
00:47:08,814 --> 00:47:10,042
Okay, we're in.

807
00:47:10,065 --> 00:47:11,225
Yes.

808
00:47:13,594 --> 00:47:15,027
l'm captain, of course.

809
00:47:16,162 --> 00:47:18,096
You two perform together?

810
00:47:18,087 --> 00:47:20,453
ln what? A cheer death match?

811
00:47:20,429 --> 00:47:21,794
No. We would be...

812
00:47:21,808 --> 00:47:23,708
Co-captains.

813
00:47:24,279 --> 00:47:27,373
Pepper, even with only half our squads,

814
00:47:27,326 --> 00:47:29,590
we've still got the best cheerleaders in camp.

815
00:47:29,573 --> 00:47:33,532
Hey, P-Dog! lt is only a jump if your feet come off the ground.

816
00:47:33,455 --> 00:47:34,752
Okay, hon?Whatever.

817
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:37,466
Pep, l'm trying to tell you, these Prairie Dogs are so bad,

818
00:47:37,434 --> 00:47:39,163
they can't even roll over.

819
00:47:39,166 --> 00:47:41,191
Don't give up on them yet.

820
00:47:41,893 --> 00:47:46,455
Come on, you all.One, two, three, four,five, six, seven, eight.

821
00:47:46,353 --> 00:47:49,516
Two, two, three, four...

822
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:55,262
We are the Flamingos!We are the Flamingos!

823
00:47:55,176 --> 00:47:57,269
Look. Please give us a second chance.

824
00:47:57,262 --> 00:47:59,662
Sorry, don't believe in those, angel pants.So you all just...

825
00:47:59,636 --> 00:48:01,331
We are the Flamingos!

826
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:05,102
We are the Flamingos!We are the Flamingos!

827
00:48:05,026 --> 00:48:06,084
Damn.

828
00:48:06,117 --> 00:48:08,312
No Flamingo could throw down like that last year.

829
00:48:08,299 --> 00:48:11,325
Get out of my camp,Voorhees!

830
00:48:11,283 --> 00:48:13,148
Hey, we're just passing through,ma'am.

831
00:48:13,143 --> 00:48:15,475
Don't get your scort in a twist.

832
00:48:17,154 --> 00:48:20,988
Wouldn't it be fun to,like, rip him a new one in Championships?

833
00:48:22,673 --> 00:48:24,732
All right, you guys.We called you out here to tell you

834
00:48:24,726 --> 00:48:26,557
that Pepper got us approved with the council.

835
00:48:26,555 --> 00:48:28,489
And now all we need is a new name.

836
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,573
l was thinking the East-West Spirit?

837
00:48:30,565 --> 00:48:32,863
Ain't that an Amtrak train?

838
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:36,802
Why can't we have a cool name,like TomKat or Bennifer?

839
00:48:36,726 --> 00:48:38,387
How about the Jarks?

840
00:48:38,394 --> 00:48:40,259
How about

841
00:48:40,255 --> 00:48:41,620
the Sharts?

842
00:48:44,009 --> 00:48:45,704
How about the Shets?

843
00:48:45,709 --> 00:48:49,270
l mean, l don't see you guys coming up with something better.

844
00:48:49,206 --> 00:48:51,299
All right.We're the Shets.

845
00:48:51,292 --> 00:48:53,590
Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm.This ain't gonna work.

846
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:55,197
Remember what happened to Tupac and Biggie?

847
00:48:55,207 --> 00:48:56,868
We'll make it work.

848
00:48:56,875 --> 00:48:58,342
We're combining the best parts of both routines,

849
00:48:58,351 --> 00:48:59,375
so get up!Get up. Up, guys.

850
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:02,004
Come on, you guys,positions. Get up!

851
00:49:10,318 --> 00:49:12,377
Penn and Chelsea,get in the back.

852
00:49:13,495 --> 00:49:16,055
l so don't do the back row.Tell her, Brooke.

853
00:49:16,029 --> 00:49:19,430
Why doesn't Goth-a-sauraus step to the back?

854
00:49:19,366 --> 00:49:21,266
Because Goth...

855
00:49:21,258 --> 00:49:23,249
Sarah can dance her little ass off.

856
00:49:23,248 --> 00:49:25,409
Now let's try this.Come on.

857
00:49:27,837 --> 00:49:29,327
Chels, please.

858
00:49:32,071 --> 00:49:34,039
Five, six, seven, eight.

859
00:49:34,028 --> 00:49:38,192
One, two, three, four,five, six, seven and eight.

860
00:49:38,103 --> 00:49:39,798
Ready? Try it.

861
00:49:39,836 --> 00:49:41,861
Five, six, seven, eight.

862
00:49:41,857 --> 00:49:45,850
One, two, three,four, five, six.Two more.

863
00:49:45,772 --> 00:49:49,708
One, two, three,four, five, six...Last one.

864
00:49:49,622 --> 00:49:53,615
One, two, three, four,five, six, seven and eight.

865
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,665
l got this.

866
00:50:07,525 --> 00:50:10,016
All right, everybody,that was great.We got the fever.

867
00:50:09,995 --> 00:50:12,259
Yeah, bite me.

868
00:50:12,241 --> 00:50:13,868
You're doing great, honey.

869
00:50:18,979 --> 00:50:20,503
Hey, Penn.

870
00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:21,543
l...

871
00:50:21,578 --> 00:50:23,478
l'll be back before next practice.

872
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:25,199
You know, l was hoping that we could talk.

873
00:50:25,203 --> 00:50:26,966
And by talk l mean,

874
00:50:26,968 --> 00:50:29,994
you know, l thought that maybe we could have a do-over.

875
00:50:29,951 --> 00:50:33,717
Do-over? Carson,l think we're done.

876
00:50:33,642 --> 00:50:37,703
Look, Penn, l'm sorry l accused you of stealing the spirit stick,

877
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:39,850
and, of course,embarrassing you

878
00:50:39,833 --> 00:50:42,028
and telling everyone your darkest secret.

879
00:50:42,015 --> 00:50:43,778
That was bad, but...

880
00:50:45,641 --> 00:50:47,734
This could be going better.

881
00:50:48,817 --> 00:50:52,548
Look, Carson,l'm gonna work my ass off to help our team win.

882
00:50:52,475 --> 00:50:53,999
But you and me,

883
00:50:54,015 --> 00:50:55,642
l think we should stick to our own coasts.

884
00:50:55,651 --> 00:50:57,243
All right?

885
00:51:02,389 --> 00:51:05,017
Seven, eight.

886
00:51:04,988 --> 00:51:07,548
One, two, three, four,five, six, seven, eight.

887
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:11,550
One, two, three, four,five, six, seven, eight.

888
00:51:12,849 --> 00:51:16,341
One, two, three, four,five, six, seven, eight.

889
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:20,241
One, two, three, four,five, six, seven, eight.

890
00:51:35,084 --> 00:51:36,210
Tight work.

891
00:51:55,168 --> 00:51:56,567
Hey!

892
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,553
Pepper's lost her mind.

893
00:52:05,563 --> 00:52:07,895
l think she put out an AMBER Alert, too.

894
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:09,535
Man, l'd love to know who took it.

895
00:52:09,542 --> 00:52:12,306
l smell P-Dog.

896
00:52:12,269 --> 00:52:13,463
No.

897
00:52:13,489 --> 00:52:14,956
l bet it was the Flamingos.

898
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:17,957
Look, either way,let's just hope the curse is done.

899
00:52:17,916 --> 00:52:19,474
We need all the help we can get.

900
00:52:19,488 --> 00:52:20,750
You know what?You're right.

901
00:52:20,772 --> 00:52:22,637
Let's practice our routine one more time.

902
00:52:24,237 --> 00:52:25,966
What? You guys! Ow!

903
00:52:44,675 --> 00:52:46,939
Get it, boy.You better work it.

904
00:53:11,754 --> 00:53:13,654
Bet l can cheer you up.

905
00:53:15,027 --> 00:53:16,824
Don't be a wad, Penn.

906
00:53:18,235 --> 00:53:19,827
Go find Carson.

907
00:53:21,604 --> 00:53:22,696
Excuse me?

908
00:53:22,727 --> 00:53:23,751
Yeah, l know.

909
00:53:23,786 --> 00:53:25,617
Never thought l'd say those words.

910
00:53:25,614 --> 00:53:29,710
But, hey, if you're into a bony ass and cankles,then what the hell.

911
00:53:29,625 --> 00:53:32,287
Knot up! Go get her, fool.

912
00:53:32,256 --> 00:53:34,417
Yeah, but after she ratted me out

913
00:53:34,405 --> 00:53:36,498
l can't make myself trust her, you know.

914
00:53:36,491 --> 00:53:37,719
Why not?

915
00:53:38,576 --> 00:53:40,305
Damn.

916
00:53:40,309 --> 00:53:41,936
l must be insane.

917
00:53:43,165 --> 00:53:45,190
Doesn't mean l have to be.

918
00:53:46,951 --> 00:53:48,851
Do what you want, Penn.

919
00:53:48,843 --> 00:53:51,209
But don't be a pendejo.

920
00:53:54,234 --> 00:53:56,566
Brooke, thanks.

921
00:53:59,656 --> 00:54:00,918
Whatever.

922
00:54:04,822 --> 00:54:06,380
By the way,

923
00:54:06,394 --> 00:54:07,656
your loss.

924
00:54:07,678 --> 00:54:09,407
l'm double-jointed.

925
00:54:13,067 --> 00:54:15,001
Five, six, seven, eight.One, two, three, four,

926
00:54:14,992 --> 00:54:18,291
five, six, seven, eight.One, two, three, four,

927
00:54:18,233 --> 00:54:19,791
five, six, seven, eight.

928
00:54:19,805 --> 00:54:21,102
One, and two,and three, and four...Hey!

929
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,350
Ever heard of this new thing called counting?

930
00:54:23,335 --> 00:54:25,098
Everybody stretch! Now!

931
00:54:25,099 --> 00:54:27,067
Ever heard of team work?Shut up, Carson.

932
00:54:27,056 --> 00:54:28,284
Yo, watch it, cuz.

933
00:54:28,307 --> 00:54:29,501
Yo, stop fronting, cuz.

934
00:54:29,559 --> 00:54:31,186
l heard you with Chicago.

935
00:54:31,195 --> 00:54:32,753
You're not just an Oreo,Aeysha.

936
00:54:32,767 --> 00:54:33,893
You're double-stuffed.

937
00:54:33,923 --> 00:54:35,015
You're wrong, Brooke!

938
00:54:35,045 --> 00:54:38,378
My girl, she been pulling drive-bys since she was a shorty.

939
00:54:38,318 --> 00:54:39,683
Yo, she was drinking 40s off the nipple.

940
00:54:39,698 --> 00:54:40,790
Carson?

941
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:42,811
So, don't be getting up on her Kool-Aid, biatch,

942
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:44,539
'cause l have seen what she's done

943
00:54:44,542 --> 00:54:47,375
to fugly swamp donkeys like you, fo shizzle.

944
00:54:48,136 --> 00:54:50,468
Carson, it's over.

945
00:54:50,445 --> 00:54:51,469
Are you sure?

946
00:54:51,505 --> 00:54:54,269
l cannot watch you ''fo shizzle'' ever again.

947
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:56,832
Good.

948
00:55:03,056 --> 00:55:06,992
Look, you all. All this,''Girl, please'' and cursing,

949
00:55:06,906 --> 00:55:08,430
it ain't me.

950
00:55:08,445 --> 00:55:10,345
l mean, it isn't me.

951
00:55:10,338 --> 00:55:12,806
l just did it to get your respect.

952
00:55:12,777 --> 00:55:14,745
See, the real Aeysha got teased every day

953
00:55:14,734 --> 00:55:16,702
in junior high for being an Oreo.

954
00:55:16,691 --> 00:55:20,320
You know,black on the outside,white on the inside.

955
00:55:20,252 --> 00:55:22,777
And l've been hood ratting it up ever since.

956
00:55:24,359 --> 00:55:25,656
You're whiter than me.

957
00:55:25,675 --> 00:55:28,872
Maybe so, but,that's who l am.

958
00:55:28,819 --> 00:55:31,219
Just a black girl who enunciates.

959
00:55:33,471 --> 00:55:35,530
Do you have something to say?

960
00:55:35,525 --> 00:55:39,188
Hey, if you want respect that badly,

961
00:55:39,118 --> 00:55:41,177
just be a bitch, like me.

962
00:55:42,519 --> 00:55:44,749
Same respect,half the effort.

963
00:55:45,439 --> 00:55:46,997
Guess the bitch is out of the bag.

964
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:48,501
Truth out!

965
00:55:51,375 --> 00:55:52,842
l'm a virgin.

966
00:55:56,764 --> 00:55:58,254
Technically.

967
00:55:58,273 --> 00:56:00,673
l just act that way so guys will like me.

968
00:56:00,647 --> 00:56:03,081
But it's really hard being slutty all the time.

969
00:56:03,053 --> 00:56:05,544
l don't know how you do it, Brooke.

970
00:56:12,454 --> 00:56:16,390
My parents aren't bribing me to be a cheerleader.

971
00:56:16,304 --> 00:56:19,364
l do it because cheerleading is dark

972
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,981
and twisted.

973
00:56:20,988 --> 00:56:22,080
Are you high?

974
00:56:22,111 --> 00:56:23,976
No. Think about it.

975
00:56:23,972 --> 00:56:25,405
We cheer for the other team's failure

976
00:56:25,416 --> 00:56:29,182
just as much as we cheer for own team's victory.

977
00:56:29,106 --> 00:56:30,767
That's so twisted.

978
00:56:30,774 --> 00:56:32,036
Sarah?

979
00:56:32,058 --> 00:56:34,618
Okay, l'm a little high.

980
00:56:34,593 --> 00:56:36,220
Yo, this is like confession.

981
00:56:38,057 --> 00:56:40,287
l'm out of here.

982
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:41,534
No, wait.

983
00:56:43,832 --> 00:56:45,197
l have something to confess.

984
00:56:45,212 --> 00:56:46,543
This should be good.

985
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:48,322
Miss USA has a secret.

986
00:56:48,325 --> 00:56:50,793
Spill, Tara Connor.

987
00:56:50,762 --> 00:56:52,320
l'm scared.

988
00:56:52,335 --> 00:56:53,734
lt's okay, Carson.

989
00:56:53,747 --> 00:56:55,180
You can do it.

990
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:57,681
No, that's it.

991
00:56:57,661 --> 00:56:59,026
l'm scared.

992
00:57:01,671 --> 00:57:02,968
You know, l act like the fearless captain

993
00:57:02,987 --> 00:57:04,249
who's not afraid to go for it,

994
00:57:04,271 --> 00:57:09,004
but, in reality,going for it is my biggest fear.

995
00:57:08,891 --> 00:57:11,052
l'm so confused.

996
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,440
But don't let it stop you, l mean,it happens all the time.

997
00:57:13,414 --> 00:57:16,144
Yeah. What l meant was,

998
00:57:16,109 --> 00:57:18,100
l just wish l could believe in myself

999
00:57:18,099 --> 00:57:20,465
as much as l believe in all of you.

1000
00:57:28,687 --> 00:57:30,120
l'm not gay.

1001
00:57:32,023 --> 00:57:33,888
l like girls

1002
00:57:33,884 --> 00:57:35,613
a lot.

1003
00:57:35,617 --> 00:57:37,209
Are you serious?

1004
00:57:38,408 --> 00:57:40,672
l'm straight.

1005
00:57:40,655 --> 00:57:44,751
You girls just assumed,

1006
00:57:44,664 --> 00:57:49,260
so once you started changing in front of me, l couldn't stop you.

1007
00:57:49,157 --> 00:57:52,649
And then, l was like committed.

1008
00:57:52,590 --> 00:57:54,114
Hold up.

1009
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:57,497
There's no way this guy's not gay, and l'll prove it.

1010
00:58:02,472 --> 00:58:03,905
Okay.

1011
00:58:03,915 --> 00:58:05,405
He is not gay.

1012
00:58:05,424 --> 00:58:07,722
No, but he is dead.

1013
00:58:07,702 --> 00:58:09,363
Get him. Get him.

1014
00:58:13,862 --> 00:58:17,263
Hey, Mom. Hey, can l speak to the General?

1015
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,526
All right.

1016
00:58:21,819 --> 00:58:23,377
Hello, sir.

1017
00:58:23,391 --> 00:58:25,052
No, everything's fine.

1018
00:58:25,059 --> 00:58:26,822
l'm fine.

1019
00:58:26,824 --> 00:58:28,314
No, l'm great.

1020
00:58:30,770 --> 00:58:34,206
Actually, l'm not at Warrior Camp exactly.

1021
00:58:34,139 --> 00:58:35,800
l'm at Cheer Camp.

1022
00:58:38,085 --> 00:58:41,612
Because l'm a cheerleader.

1023
00:58:43,315 --> 00:58:44,976
Yes, one of those.

1024
00:58:48,289 --> 00:58:49,847
Sir?

1025
00:58:49,861 --> 00:58:51,328
Dad?

1026
00:58:51,336 --> 00:58:52,325
Dad!

1027
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:55,912
Listen.

1028
00:58:55,925 --> 00:58:57,654
This is the funny thing, when you hear the rest,

1029
00:58:57,657 --> 00:59:00,854
cheerleading is gonna sound like the good part.

1030
00:59:02,341 --> 00:59:03,968
About West Point...

1031
00:59:04,972 --> 00:59:08,669
Okay, that was traumatic but good, right?

1032
00:59:08,598 --> 00:59:10,031
l mean, now we can work as a team.

1033
00:59:10,041 --> 00:59:12,407
Yeah. A team of freaks.

1034
00:59:12,384 --> 00:59:14,579
We are not a team, okay?

1035
00:59:14,566 --> 00:59:18,024
We can't combine routines and this was a dumbass idea!

1036
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:21,200
Tell them, Ruben. We can do this.

1037
00:59:22,490 --> 00:59:24,890
We blow. We cannot do this.

1038
00:59:24,897 --> 00:59:27,331
Because we're cursed, all of us.

1039
00:59:27,303 --> 00:59:30,272
Holy crap, Ruben, snap out of it!

1040
00:59:31,538 --> 00:59:33,972
What have you done with happy Ruben?

1041
00:59:33,944 --> 00:59:35,411
lt's weird, you know.

1042
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:37,547
Now that l'm not gay anymore,

1043
00:59:37,538 --> 00:59:39,335
l'm not gay anymore.

1044
00:59:39,335 --> 00:59:40,859
Okay, we're freaks!

1045
00:59:40,875 --> 00:59:42,342
But let's make that work for us.

1046
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:44,614
Come on, you guys. l mean, there has to be some way

1047
00:59:44,597 --> 00:59:46,827
that we can perform together.

1048
00:59:48,735 --> 00:59:50,794
We can start with couples.

1049
01:00:10,681 --> 01:00:11,943
l'll take the lead.

1050
01:00:11,965 --> 01:00:13,193
So, like, we're gonna copy them?

1051
01:00:13,216 --> 01:00:14,979
l'm gonna move to the right then to the left.

1052
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:16,413
Okay.

1053
01:00:16,425 --> 01:00:17,517
Start up like that, all right?

1054
01:00:17,548 --> 01:00:18,572
Okay.

1055
01:00:18,606 --> 01:00:20,267
Here we go.

1056
01:00:20,275 --> 01:00:21,435
Hey, you want to try this?

1057
01:00:21,461 --> 01:00:22,553
There you go.

1058
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:25,231
Top again.

1059
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:30,668
All right, top again. Here we go.

1060
01:00:36,638 --> 01:00:39,368
Give me a turn. There you go.

1061
01:01:07,247 --> 01:01:08,509
For real.

1062
01:01:10,487 --> 01:01:11,954
This could work.

1063
01:01:11,962 --> 01:01:14,362
And l'll prove it. Get over here.

1064
01:01:16,486 --> 01:01:19,216
All right, everybody ready? From the top.

1065
01:01:19,182 --> 01:01:21,742
Look, l'm cool about you coming out of the straight closet.

1066
01:01:21,716 --> 01:01:23,911
Please, you're just saying that so l'll try to catch you.

1067
01:01:23,898 --> 01:01:25,456
Try?

1068
01:01:25,470 --> 01:01:28,439
All right. Five, six, seven, eight.

1069
01:02:20,656 --> 01:02:22,624
That was tight. You know what?

1070
01:02:22,677 --> 01:02:24,645
l think we could actually win this.

1071
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:28,251
Maybe we should make sure.

1072
01:02:28,259 --> 01:02:32,491
''Compare the opposing army so you may know where strength lies.''

1073
01:02:32,399 --> 01:02:33,559
Recon?

1074
01:02:39,586 --> 01:02:41,611
Hey, guys. We need to get some disguises.

1075
01:02:48,345 --> 01:02:50,575
They practice on stage 70A. Find it.

1076
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:52,583
Cell phones ready?

1077
01:02:52,579 --> 01:02:55,207
Recon positions by texting only. Break!

1078
01:03:10,354 --> 01:03:12,083
Chels,

1079
01:03:12,087 --> 01:03:13,952
l'm right next to you.

1080
01:03:29,862 --> 01:03:31,193
Thank you.

1081
01:03:39,391 --> 01:03:41,154
Hey, Ron, get the gate for me.

1082
01:03:42,888 --> 01:03:44,753
Hello, Mr. Voorhees.

1083
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:46,581
The Flamingos just started...

1084
01:03:46,578 --> 01:03:48,546
Listen, we have got to tighten up the security.

1085
01:03:48,535 --> 01:03:50,901
l need more time for my Flamingos...

1086
01:03:51,358 --> 01:03:53,155
Keep up the good work.

1087
01:03:55,626 --> 01:03:58,117
l guess your father would laugh at us, huh?

1088
01:03:58,096 --> 01:04:00,155
He's not big into laughter.

1089
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:02,846
You know, l told him everything.

1090
01:04:02,813 --> 01:04:03,939
Really?

1091
01:04:03,968 --> 01:04:06,436
Then what'd he say about you being a cheerleader?

1092
01:04:06,406 --> 01:04:08,431
Well, that he laughed at.

1093
01:04:10,866 --> 01:04:13,096
Hey, covert cheer-ops.

1094
01:04:13,626 --> 01:04:15,389
Two-to-one pyramid.

1095
01:04:18,149 --> 01:04:21,346
All right, Ruben, Eric, Nick, you three in the corner, be the base.

1096
01:04:21,293 --> 01:04:23,989
Come on, guys, hurry up. Let's go.

1097
01:04:23,957 --> 01:04:25,447
Chelsea, watch out for the guard.

1098
01:04:25,465 --> 01:04:28,332
Brooke, first level. All right.

1099
01:04:28,288 --> 01:04:30,119
One, two, three.

1100
01:04:31,528 --> 01:04:33,257
All right. Now, Carson.

1101
01:04:33,261 --> 01:04:34,888
One, two, three.

1102
01:04:41,924 --> 01:04:45,360
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

1103
01:04:45,292 --> 01:04:47,522
l don't want to see any loose knees.

1104
01:04:47,507 --> 01:04:49,941
Jason, that's on the two. You're always late.

1105
01:04:49,913 --> 01:04:51,676
Wait, how did you guys get in here?

1106
01:04:51,677 --> 01:04:55,545
Seriously, that guy wasn't even a real guard.

1107
01:04:55,464 --> 01:04:57,989
''lf an enemy leaves the door open, you must rush in.''

1108
01:04:57,966 --> 01:04:59,365
Art of War.

1109
01:05:00,469 --> 01:05:01,868
Base, keep it together now.

1110
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:05,281
l really want to see you attack the ground. Oh, yeah!

1111
01:05:07,206 --> 01:05:08,867
Oh, my gosh.

1112
01:05:08,875 --> 01:05:10,672
Welcome to cheer-topia.

1113
01:05:10,671 --> 01:05:12,832
State of the art everything.

1114
01:05:13,912 --> 01:05:15,607
ls that Letty Trotter?

1115
01:05:15,612 --> 01:05:17,079
Choreographer to the stars?

1116
01:05:17,089 --> 01:05:18,249
That look on your faces,

1117
01:05:18,275 --> 01:05:20,436
that's the same look l had after my divorce.

1118
01:05:20,425 --> 01:05:22,723
So sad to see a dream die.

1119
01:05:23,987 --> 01:05:26,785
Anyhoo, give my best to Pepper, would you?

1120
01:05:31,141 --> 01:05:33,541
Vance wasn't bluffing.

1121
01:05:33,516 --> 01:05:35,541
Their tumbling is amazing.

1122
01:05:35,537 --> 01:05:36,629
Those Flamingos are like...

1123
01:05:36,659 --> 01:05:38,217
Better than us.

1124
01:05:38,745 --> 01:05:40,474
We need to come up with something really good.

1125
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:41,534
No, really?

1126
01:05:41,569 --> 01:05:43,161
l thought we'd come up with something bad

1127
01:05:43,173 --> 01:05:44,731
and see if we can win that way.

1128
01:05:44,745 --> 01:05:47,908
Sorry, it's a reflex.

1129
01:05:47,857 --> 01:05:48,881
What are we going to do?

1130
01:05:48,917 --> 01:05:50,714
Look, l don't know, okay? l can't believe it.

1131
01:05:50,713 --> 01:05:54,342
After all this, l just wanted to win Camp Championships once.

1132
01:05:54,274 --> 01:05:55,605
Don't freak out, Carson.

1133
01:05:55,622 --> 01:05:58,284
Yeah, easy for you to say. You've won.

1134
01:06:01,589 --> 01:06:04,581
Look, our dance routine is better than theirs.

1135
01:06:04,541 --> 01:06:06,941
We just need a triple threat.

1136
01:06:06,915 --> 01:06:09,349
Let's think. What would Sun Tzu do?

1137
01:06:12,819 --> 01:06:16,311
''Make use of concubines who are greedy for gold.''

1138
01:06:25,332 --> 01:06:27,664
l don't think Sun Tzu would be riding a rollercoaster, Carson.

1139
01:06:27,642 --> 01:06:29,610
You see how the red and blue rails loop?

1140
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:31,362
Criss-cross and then corkscrew away?

1141
01:06:31,364 --> 01:06:33,355
Yeah, almost like a double helix.

1142
01:06:34,348 --> 01:06:36,179
That'll be the path of the two flyers.

1143
01:06:36,177 --> 01:06:37,166
Sweet! Sweet!

1144
01:06:37,203 --> 01:06:38,898
No one's ever done that before.

1145
01:06:38,904 --> 01:06:40,769
We're gonna need something new if we want to win.

1146
01:06:40,765 --> 01:06:43,029
lmagine if we pull it off. That would be sick!

1147
01:06:43,043 --> 01:06:44,476
lt'd be awesome. So cool!

1148
01:06:44,487 --> 01:06:46,751
But is it possible?

1149
01:06:46,732 --> 01:06:49,599
Yeah, it's gonna be really difficult for the flyers.

1150
01:06:49,556 --> 01:06:51,217
Who's gonna do it?

1151
01:06:52,283 --> 01:06:53,841
Five, six, seven, eight...

1152
01:07:19,907 --> 01:07:21,067
You okay?

1153
01:07:21,095 --> 01:07:22,187
Yeah. l'm fine.

1154
01:07:22,218 --> 01:07:24,277
All right, you guys, let's do it again.

1155
01:07:37,619 --> 01:07:40,747
One, two, three, four, five, six...

1156
01:08:10,858 --> 01:08:13,190
Hey, Aeysha, who taught you to sew?

1157
01:08:13,168 --> 01:08:14,430
Martha Stewart.

1158
01:08:14,452 --> 01:08:17,046
All right. One portable hot press.

1159
01:08:17,018 --> 01:08:19,043
Nice work. Where'd you find that?

1160
01:08:19,039 --> 01:08:22,998
Concierges can do anything all over the world.

1161
01:08:22,922 --> 01:08:26,255
You'll see for yourself when we win tomorrow.

1162
01:08:32,226 --> 01:08:34,421
Where in the world of competition sports

1163
01:08:34,408 --> 01:08:36,342
will you find two arch rivals,

1164
01:08:36,333 --> 01:08:38,494
forced by a dramatic twist of fate,

1165
01:08:38,482 --> 01:08:40,609
to join teams and combine their styles

1166
01:08:40,601 --> 01:08:42,694
to face a mysterious new challenger?

1167
01:08:42,685 --> 01:08:45,950
Well, right here at the All Star Cheer Camp Championships,

1168
01:08:45,894 --> 01:08:47,919
where one of these teams will win the title

1169
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:49,815
and the right to represent the United States

1170
01:08:49,809 --> 01:08:51,674
in the World Cheer Exhibition Tour.

1171
01:08:51,669 --> 01:08:52,966
And who will that be?

1172
01:08:59,017 --> 01:09:03,954
Up next on Cheer TV, the most exciting cheerleading in the world!

1173
01:09:03,829 --> 01:09:05,763
All right. All right. All right. Ladies and gentlemen,

1174
01:09:05,755 --> 01:09:08,019
boys and girls, moms and dads,

1175
01:09:08,001 --> 01:09:11,061
welcome to the All Star Cheer Camp Championship!

1176
01:09:12,717 --> 01:09:14,082
You guys look great.

1177
01:09:14,096 --> 01:09:15,859
All right. Well, let's not waste any more time.

1178
01:09:15,862 --> 01:09:18,888
Let's bring out our first people, representing Camp Victory,

1179
01:09:18,845 --> 01:09:22,281
ladies and gentlemen, make a lot of noise for Sebring!

1180
01:09:45,603 --> 01:09:48,834
PEPPER.. Thank you, Prairie Dogs. Good luck in the competition.

1181
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:52,238
Next up on the practice pad, the Flamingos.

1182
01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:04,485
...three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

1183
01:10:15,635 --> 01:10:16,761
Yeah.

1184
01:10:28,501 --> 01:10:29,490
Yeah!

1185
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:31,152
Yeah! Good job.

1186
01:10:31,998 --> 01:10:33,966
All right. All right!

1187
01:10:35,142 --> 01:10:36,939
Great job, Sebring!

1188
01:10:37,997 --> 01:10:39,521
They really brought it, didn't they?

1189
01:10:39,538 --> 01:10:43,201
Another fantastic routine. Am I right?

1190
01:10:43,805 --> 01:10:46,296
Yeah! Are you ready for another?

1191
01:10:46,660 --> 01:10:48,787
All right! All the way from South Dakota,

1192
01:10:48,778 --> 01:10:50,871
give it up for the Prairie Dogs!

1193
01:10:50,863 --> 01:10:52,922
Don't forget your lock out.

1194
01:11:00,104 --> 01:11:02,834
All right, guys, let's run it. Five, six...

1195
01:12:13,449 --> 01:12:15,383
This is a cheer-saster.

1196
01:12:15,566 --> 01:12:17,295
A cheer-tastrophe.

1197
01:12:17,813 --> 01:12:20,475
A total cheer-clipse of the sun.

1198
01:12:20,443 --> 01:12:21,432
Not bad. Good one.

1199
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:22,494
Yes.

1200
01:12:22,529 --> 01:12:23,962
Look, no, you guys are all wrong, okay.

1201
01:12:23,972 --> 01:12:25,906
We're still good. We just...

1202
01:12:25,897 --> 01:12:27,797
We want the crowd to be pumped up.

1203
01:13:31,928 --> 01:13:35,159
MAN.. Okay, all right. They were really good, right?

1204
01:13:36,002 --> 01:13:38,835
Sharks, Jets, Shets.

1205
01:13:38,793 --> 01:13:41,023
lt doesn't really matter what you call yourselves.

1206
01:13:41,008 --> 01:13:44,808
Oh, and you call yourselves the Flaming Hoes.

1207
01:13:44,729 --> 01:13:46,856
Yeah. That's a bad choice.

1208
01:13:46,847 --> 01:13:51,181
...introduce to you, the mighty Flamingos.

1209
01:13:55,574 --> 01:13:58,941
Hope you've been practicing your loser facials.

1210
01:13:58,879 --> 01:14:01,211
Oh, wait. l think you're on.

1211
01:14:01,445 --> 01:14:03,345
You are so on.

1212
01:14:03,370 --> 01:14:04,997
Shelby, come on!

1213
01:14:05,007 --> 01:14:06,599
Shelby, come on!

1214
01:14:06,611 --> 01:14:07,703
Come on, you guys.

1215
01:14:07,734 --> 01:14:08,758
Let's go.

1216
01:14:17,455 --> 01:14:18,922
Flamingos, think pink!

1217
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:20,486
Pink, pink, pink!

1218
01:14:53,198 --> 01:14:55,029
They're even better than l remembered.

1219
01:14:55,027 --> 01:14:57,154
And they're not even cursed.

1220
01:14:57,529 --> 01:14:58,894
Carson.

1221
01:15:12,416 --> 01:15:14,680
Okay, you've got to get over yourself and fast.

1222
01:15:14,662 --> 01:15:16,323
What? Stop psyching yourself out.

1223
01:15:16,331 --> 01:15:17,355
Look, l'm totally fine.

1224
01:15:17,389 --> 01:15:19,755
You're totally not, and they know that you're scared.

1225
01:15:19,732 --> 01:15:21,131
Look, what else do you want me to say?

1226
01:15:21,143 --> 01:15:22,508
You've been right about me all along.

1227
01:15:22,523 --> 01:15:23,820
l'm not a good leader, my skills are...

1228
01:15:23,839 --> 01:15:25,773
You idiot. This is not about skills.

1229
01:15:25,764 --> 01:15:27,664
This competition is about showmanship.

1230
01:15:27,656 --> 01:15:30,523
Your choreography is going to win it for us.

1231
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:34,007
Don't you know you're more creative than me?

1232
01:15:33,945 --> 01:15:36,675
Why else would l bother to put you down?

1233
01:15:37,026 --> 01:15:40,860
Carson, you've got it. You always have.

1234
01:15:41,645 --> 01:15:44,443
But for the Shets' sake, now you gotta bring it.

1235
01:15:44,405 --> 01:15:47,033
Hey, it's your year, remember?

1236
01:15:47,004 --> 01:15:49,404
No, Brooke, it's our year.

1237
01:16:12,222 --> 01:16:13,519
All right, you guys, this is it.

1238
01:16:13,537 --> 01:16:14,765
Just stay tight and lock out.

1239
01:16:14,788 --> 01:16:16,312
Okay. On three.

1240
01:16:17,388 --> 01:16:18,685
One, two, three.

1241
01:16:18,703 --> 01:16:19,931
Shets!

1242
01:16:24,286 --> 01:16:26,550
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1243
01:16:27,045 --> 01:16:28,478
Yeah. Hey.

1244
01:16:33,302 --> 01:16:35,202
Yeah! Great job!

1245
01:16:36,606 --> 01:16:40,508
And now for our last performance of the day,

1246
01:16:40,424 --> 01:16:45,987
from Camp Spirit Thunder, rising from the ashes of both coasts,

1247
01:16:45,846 --> 01:16:48,679
here are the Shets!

1248
01:17:03,011 --> 01:17:05,536
Don't worry, skids, l checked your marks.

1249
01:17:05,514 --> 01:17:07,004
Just catch me, okay.

1250
01:17:07,022 --> 01:17:08,148
Cradle.

1251
01:17:08,722 --> 01:17:10,212
All set, Penn.

1252
01:18:35,479 --> 01:18:36,605
Cradle.

1253
01:18:38,302 --> 01:18:40,202
Told you l'd catch you.

1254
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,686
Yes, yes. Yes, yes!

1255
01:21:25,591 --> 01:21:26,922
We did it!

1256
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:35,319
That's what l'm talking about. Give me some.

1257
01:21:35,313 --> 01:21:36,940
Some what?

1258
01:21:36,949 --> 01:21:39,179
Okay. All right. Yeah!

1259
01:21:39,163 --> 01:21:43,327
As always, Cheer Camp Championships deliver, huh? Let's hear you.

1260
01:21:43,238 --> 01:21:45,206
We'll have to wait for the judges to score

1261
01:21:45,195 --> 01:21:47,095
because this one's going to be close.

1262
01:21:48,147 --> 01:21:49,876
Too close. Yeah.

1263
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:51,905
Now is a really bad time to be cursed.

1264
01:21:52,863 --> 01:21:55,696
You know what? Who cares if we're cursed?

1265
01:21:55,655 --> 01:21:58,818
Getting cursed may have been the best thing that's ever happened to us.

1266
01:21:58,766 --> 01:22:01,200
Without this curse, we would have never become this team,

1267
01:22:01,173 --> 01:22:03,107
and hit a stunt that's never been done before.

1268
01:22:03,098 --> 01:22:05,089
l mean, that was amazing.

1269
01:22:05,537 --> 01:22:08,267
I have the results right here.

1270
01:22:08,231 --> 01:22:10,927
I'll be reading third place, apparently.

1271
01:22:10,895 --> 01:22:14,729
In third place, representing South Dakota, the Prairie Dogs.

1272
01:22:15,579 --> 01:22:17,206
Way to go, Dogs.

1273
01:22:18,209 --> 01:22:20,803
Look, we all gave 100%, and we trust each other.

1274
01:22:20,777 --> 01:22:24,042
Who cares about some stupid old trophy and world tour?

1275
01:22:23,985 --> 01:22:27,250
Coming in at second place,

1276
01:22:27,193 --> 01:22:29,184
the Flamingos!

1277
01:22:30,338 --> 01:22:31,362
Oh, my God!

1278
01:22:31,396 --> 01:22:34,024
All right. So that means the winning squad

1279
01:22:33,996 --> 01:22:36,055
that will represent the United States

1280
01:22:36,113 --> 01:22:38,206
on a Cheer Exhibition World Tour

1281
01:22:38,199 --> 01:22:41,760
is the East-West Shets!

1282
01:22:43,364 --> 01:22:44,956
Brooke, l meant what l said. l know.

1283
01:22:44,968 --> 01:22:46,595
lt's just... We freaking won!

1284
01:22:46,605 --> 01:22:47,629
l know.

1285
01:22:48,786 --> 01:22:51,050
Pepper, got something for you.

1286
01:22:51,032 --> 01:22:52,727
My spirit stick.

1287
01:22:52,733 --> 01:22:54,360
Vance, l knew it was you all along.

1288
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:56,360
But why? You don't even believe in it.

1289
01:22:56,358 --> 01:22:57,484
No, but you do.

1290
01:22:57,706 --> 01:22:59,970
Besides, the stupid stick didn't work in the first place.

1291
01:22:59,951 --> 01:23:01,714
Pepper. Maybe it did.

1292
01:23:01,717 --> 01:23:03,446
We broke the curse.

1293
01:23:04,411 --> 01:23:06,811
You sure did. Congratulations.

1294
01:23:06,785 --> 01:23:09,379
No more curse! No more curse!

1295
01:23:09,353 --> 01:23:12,880
No more curse! No more curse!

1296
01:23:12,817 --> 01:23:14,648
No more curse!

1297
01:23:15,224 --> 01:23:16,418
Carson.

1298
01:23:36,271 --> 01:23:38,330
Boy walk in the spot, he's so fresh

1299
01:23:38,325 --> 01:23:40,316
He got what he needs to impressin'

1300
01:23:40,314 --> 01:23:42,373
just look at the way that he dressin'

1301
01:23:42,367 --> 01:23:44,358
Ain't no question chicks like oh

1302
01:23:44,357 --> 01:23:46,416
Girl walkin' the spot, she stop traffic

1303
01:23:46,410 --> 01:23:48,435
She's blowing your mind with her asset

1304
01:23:48,431 --> 01:23:52,333
So jessica Alba fantastic Instant classic boys like oh

1305
01:23:52,346 --> 01:23:54,143
Maybe I can see us moving like that

1306
01:23:54,206 --> 01:23:56,003
Maybe I can see us touching like that

1307
01:23:56,003 --> 01:23:58,198
