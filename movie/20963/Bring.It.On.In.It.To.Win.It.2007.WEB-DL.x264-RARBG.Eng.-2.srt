1
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:39,596
East Coast!West Coast!

2
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:41,002
East Coast!

3
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:45,009
How does if feel to be the
centerfold for losers?

4
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:48,205
Not this year. Sharks all the way.

5
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:49,722
Yeah.

6
00:00:49,784 --> 00:00:52,054
Just because you shanks go all
the way...

7
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,639
What?

8
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:56,652
...doesn't mean your team will.

9
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,347
Boys.

10
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:07,496
One, two, three, four.

11
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,587
"J" to the "E" to the "T"
to the "S"

12
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,969
jets kick ass from east to west

13
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:16,568
All you do is shake your butts
Cheer 101 for stupid sluts

14
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:20,297
We're the West Coast Sharks
And we got bite

15
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:22,751
We got what it takes to win this fight

16
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:25,006
jets, you stiff,you dull, you old

17
00:01:25,086 --> 00:01:27,246
Your moves and motions leave us cold

18
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:32,619
Carson, captain of their team A
loser even in her dreams

19
00:01:37,031 --> 00:01:39,301
You said it all,except one hitch

20
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,702
She's a stuck-up, nasty,stupid
little witch

21
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:44,069
You girls think that you're ahead

22
00:01:44,205 --> 00:01:46,495
Our mascot's moves will knock you dead!

23
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:26,495
I am so psyched!

24
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:30,353
No, really. This time it wasn't
a nightmare.

25
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:32,151
Busted.

26
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:09,205
Damn! We're gonna have some fun.

27
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:12,451
Fun? We're not here to have fun,
Ruben. We're here to win.

28
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:15,356
Do you think East Coast is here
to have fun?Hell, no! So, no fun.

29
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:18,399
Okay. I won't use the "F"
word anymore.

30
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:21,425
Look, this year we're taking the
title and going on the world tour.

31
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:22,762
Hell to the yeah!

32
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:25,125
Let's bust some East Coast attitude!

33
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:28,066
Reality check. The Jets have beat
us three years in a row.

34
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,701
What's your problem,doom cookie?

35
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:33,206
No problem. Let the disemboweling begin!

36
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,422
Dibs on their entrails!

37
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:43,716
Cheer TV is live at the Hard Rock
Hotel at Universal Orlando.

38
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,420
And I'm here with Pepper Driscoll
and Vance Voorhees,

39
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:48,963
owners of the two rival cheer camps.

40
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:50,929
Pepper, can you tell us a little bit about

41
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,857
the All Star Cheer Camp Championships?

42
00:03:52,934 --> 00:03:55,994
I'd love to. Well, this year is
extra special,

43
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,900
because the winning squad will
represent our great nation

44
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:00,842
on a Cheer Exhibition World Tour.

45
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,097
That's right.

46
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:05,196
And my teams will come in at
least first and second place again.

47
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,579
Pepper's camp has both champion squads

48
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:11,619
that epitomize the clash in
American cheer styles.

49
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:14,223
In fact, last year,one of her squads,

50
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:16,978
the East Coast jets,with their
traditional cheer moves

51
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:19,558
narrowly defeated the West Coast Sharks,

52
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:21,557
another one of Pepper's squads shown here

53
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:23,489
with their new wave dance styling

54
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:26,094
inspired by music video choreography.

55
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,659
In the cheer world,the controversy
is brewing over

56
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:33,036
what exactly defines cheerleading,
precision or flavor.

57
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:34,657
Speaking of controversy,Vance,

58
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,731
is the bad blood between your
Camp Victory

59
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:38,779
and Pepper's Camp Spirit Thunder

60
00:04:38,846 --> 00:04:40,246
related to your divorce?

61
00:04:41,382 --> 00:04:43,042
Of course not. We're both professionals,

62
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,706
and we handle our craft seriously.

63
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,075
Which is why I can say that, this year,

64
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:48,213
a Camp Victory team will vanquish
all comers.

65
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,718
By vanquish he means third again.

66
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,731
No, this year Camp Victory has
a secret weapon.

67
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,764
Bulltwinkle, you do not.

68
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:58,159
We do, and I guess you're gonna
have to wait and see.

69
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:01,761
Well, we'll all see in this
Saturday's World Cheer Exhibition

70
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:03,795
right here on Cheer TV.

71
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,559
All right, after everybody unpacks,

72
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:28,988
we need to practice our home routine.

73
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:30,263
We just got here.

74
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:31,801
Yeah, and if we want to leave
here winners,

75
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:33,964
it's going to take practice,
practice and more practice.

76
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:35,164
And after that...

77
00:05:35,236 --> 00:05:36,426
Oh, my God. Carson.

78
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,702
I'm, like, so glad you came back this year.

79
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,901
Hey, Brooke,of course we came back.

80
00:05:40,975 --> 00:05:44,595
After losing to us three years
in a row,it's, like, so brave.

81
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,798
Yo! Can we burn this Least Coast trash?

82
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,249
You know what?They're not even
worth it, Aeysha.

83
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:51,476
Give it up, Brooke. We're not
gonna play like that.

84
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:53,822
Oh, you mean like champions?

85
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,820
Yeah. Not really your thing, huh?

86
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,820
Practice in 10 minutes!

87
00:05:58,891 --> 00:05:59,881
Ta-ta.

88
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:03,292
We're from the West Coast The
mighty, mighty West Coast

89
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,703
We ain't got no fear We're the
best,it's our year!

90
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:09,897
W- E-S-T,West Coast can't be beat!

91
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,800
I think it's time for a little
guerilla warfare.

92
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:15,643
Brooke, where are we gonna find gorillas?

93
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,010
Just follow my lead.

94
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:20,478
All right, you guys,spread out.
Give it flavor.

95
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,407
Five, six, seven, eight.

96
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:26,153
One, two, four,five and six,
seven and eight.

97
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,849
One, two, and four,five and six,
seven and eight.

98
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:32,252
One and two... Ignore them!

99
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,385
Six, seven, eight. Hey, girls.

100
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,585
Oh, hell, no.

101
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:36,991
Oh, shit.

102
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,363
She's gonna go throw down.

103
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,660
Yo, Paris Hilton.

104
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,733
If you and this little purse dog of yours

105
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:45,172
ever pull that skanky East Coast mess again,

106
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:46,899
I will slice you like government cheese!

107
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:48,573
Aeysha, give it a rest. Give it a rest.

108
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:50,171
I swear to you I will...

109
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:52,014
I didn't know the government made cheese.

110
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,808
She better watch her back.

111
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:56,339
What?

112
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:57,847
You go, girl.

113
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,784
You know what?I need to rework
that transition, anyway,

114
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:03,554
so free time until opening ceremonies.

115
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:35,478
Whoa.

116
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:39,161
Hey, are you okay?

117
00:07:39,227 --> 00:07:40,517
I'm fine.

118
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:42,694
You kind of got skid marks.

119
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:46,457
Good. Now the police can track
down the stroller.

120
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,730
Hey, why do I feel like I've
met you before?

121
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,742
I don't know. Maybe in a prior life.

122
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:54,565
Well, I was thinking this one,
but now that sounds whack.

123
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,275
So, where are you from?

124
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:59,282
California. A place called Eden Hills.
You?

125
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:00,965
Nowhere and everywhere.

126
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:02,784
You know,I'm an army brat.

127
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,480
I guess I'm just a regular brat.

128
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:06,248
I've never been out of the country.

129
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,950
We just moved back from London.

130
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:10,321
Really?We're going there soon.

131
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,360
Oh, you're gonna love England.

132
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:14,186
You know me so well. Oh, no doubt.

133
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,730
Because, you know,in our prior life,

134
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:17,416
when we were guards at Buckingham Palace,

135
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:19,828
you were that hottie wearing
that bearskin hat.

136
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,800
Of course, all the guards were
trying to hook up with you.

137
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:23,359
Oh, right, let me guess.

138
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:24,896
You defended my honor.

139
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:27,502
No, I was trying to get at you, too.

140
00:08:27,876 --> 00:08:29,336
Hey, you ever done the Double-Dragon?

141
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:30,838
What?

142
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,905
Right. I got to go.

143
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:39,475
Hey, hold up, skids.

144
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,352
What if I want to see you again?

145
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:46,675
Number?

146
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:51,860
916-555-0198.

147
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:58,933
Cool. Now, I got your number, skids.

148
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:00,336
It's Carson.

149
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:01,697
It's Penn.

150
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,214
If you need help wiping that off...

151
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:15,252
Just so you know,I'm not mad anymore.

152
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:17,692
I MySpaced it all out of my system.

153
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:21,017
Now, hurry up,or we're gonna
be late for the opening ceremony.

154
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:23,894
Why him? Why now?

155
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,233
Why who?

156
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:27,429
Aeysha,I met this guy.

157
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:30,161
What? I wasn't even sure you
remember what guys were.

158
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:31,827
His name is Penn and he's so...

159
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,425
Carson, breathe.

160
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,596
He's awesome and smart,but in a good way.

161
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:37,106
And he's hot,caliente hot.

162
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:39,697
Aeysha, I want to lick his abs.

163
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,910
But you didn't, right?

164
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:42,011
No!

165
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:45,779
I need to stay focused,that
means no cute boys.

166
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:48,913
Right now,beating the Jets is
my top priority.

167
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:50,049
And you're doing the right thing.

168
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:51,152
I know.

169
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:52,923
So, can I have him?

170
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:00,296
Ooh, Penn looks hot.

171
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:01,487
Just don't.

172
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:07,031
What do you mean?

173
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,727
I like your hair that way, Chelsea.

174
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:09,938
Oh, it's this new gel.

175
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,530
My hair always looks better when
there's something sticky in it.

176
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:16,208
All right. Who is she?

177
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:17,870
What?

178
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,581
The girl who's making you stupid.

179
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,579
All right. Check it out. I met her today

180
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:23,375
when I was running. Her name's...

181
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,476
Carson!Carson!

182
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,187
Right. Wrong.

183
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:27,389
She's a Shark.

184
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,550
She's the frigging captain of the Sharks.

185
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,928
And what did she say?What did she want?

186
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:31,227
Did she ask about our routines?

187
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:32,528
Yeah, right.

188
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,360
Cheering was the last thing
we talked about.

189
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:36,334
Penn, she's like your sworn emeny.

190
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:37,893
I swear it.

191
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:40,628
Trust me. She's not my enemy.

192
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:50,308
Penn, you need to know.

193
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:52,784
Carson's a two-faced,back-biting,
man-eating Shark!

194
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:54,843
Yeah. And guys hate biters.

195
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:56,181
Why are you guys busting on me?

196
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:57,715
Because you don't get it.

197
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,161
Yeah. I think I do.

198
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,116
Don't flatter yourself, Penn.

199
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:07,597
This is about our team,about winning.

200
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:08,968
So now what, Captain?

201
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:10,826
Are you gonna forbid me from
seeing Carson?

202
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:12,003
I would never do that.

203
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:14,372
Good, 'cause it wouldn't work.

204
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,010
He can't date a Shark!

205
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:25,682
Duh, Chelsea. Watch and learn.

206
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:36,058
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

207
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,289
Hi, everybody.

208
00:11:37,365 --> 00:11:39,485
Welcome to Camp Spirit Thunder.

209
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,699
This year,we're so proud to welcome

210
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:48,142
a new member to our family, okay.

211
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:49,699
I heard she's really tough.

212
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:54,106
Give a big Spirit welcome to
our new choreographer,Chicago.

213
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,050
Come on up here, girl.

214
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:03,314
All right, all eyes on me.

215
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,820
Now, I want you all to remember
this gorgeous face,

216
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,262
'cause it will haunt you in your sleep.

217
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:09,988
Now, I believe in hard work.

218
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,662
Winning knows no pain.

219
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:15,002
So, when I say jump,I wanna hear,
"How high?"

220
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,228
Now jump.

221
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,432
How high?

222
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:18,993
That's what I'm talking about.

223
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,512
Don't hate the player, baby.

224
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:24,636
Okay, seriously,Cheerzilla is
a little scary.

225
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:27,535
What? I love her.

226
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:30,853
She's the kind of black woman
gay men emulate. She's amazing.

227
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:36,857
Welcome your cheer-tastic 2008
Spirit Thunder instructors!

228
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:43,485
Come on, guys.

229
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:50,635
That was really great.

230
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,260
Yeah! Aren't they terrific?

231
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:26,074
Aren't they wonderful?

232
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:28,363
Yeah!

233
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:30,439
All right.

234
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:36,280
And now, as you know,we have a
very special tradition here

235
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:39,279
at Camp Spirit Thunder.

236
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:44,854
This spirit stick was given to me

237
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:47,545
by the father of cheerleading himself,

238
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:49,356
Herkie Herkimer.

239
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:53,419
It embodies the heart and the
soul of cheerleading,

240
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,900
and it brings the luck of the
cheer spirits.

241
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:00,410
So, each team will be able to experience

242
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:03,872
its powerful aura for one night.

243
00:14:07,214 --> 00:14:08,244
That's right.

244
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:13,305
And last year's winners of the
Championships will have the honors first,

245
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:15,176
the East Coast jets.

246
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,656
Go get it. What?

247
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:23,588
Come on. You do it. Go. What?

248
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:25,153
just a warning.

249
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:30,071
Lose the stick and you will face
the wrath of the cheer gods.

250
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:34,396
I once knew a cheerleader who
misplaced the stick for just one day

251
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:36,204
and she broke her leg doing a
simple toe touch.

252
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,535
Wait for it.

253
00:14:37,611 --> 00:14:38,871
So guard it with your lives, people.

254
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:40,135
Wait for it.

255
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,553
You will find good fortune while
it's in your possession, jets.

256
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,811
Cheer smackdown.

257
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:53,448
Words, shorty. Use your words.

258
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:54,616
Him.

259
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:56,488
Abs Penn.

260
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,456
Go jets.

261
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:00,521
Oh, girl. You know a cheer Crip

262
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:02,569
can't be hitting it with a cheer Blood.

263
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:08,496
All right. Everybody have a fun and
safe week here at Camp Spirit Thunder!

264
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:14,683
You're a Jet?

265
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:15,808
Yeah, that's a trip, huh?

266
00:15:15,882 --> 00:15:16,872
Why didn't you tell me?

267
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,420
What, that I was a male cheerleader?

268
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,776
Sure. That's a real panty-dropper!

269
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,046
Look, I didn't mean any...

270
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,745
Did Brooke tell you to play me?

271
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:27,594
Sucks to be you, huh?

272
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:30,125
Carson, I didn't know you were
a cheerleader.

273
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:31,745
Like... And what's the big deal?

274
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,360
I'm a Jet. So what?

275
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,533
So what?

276
00:15:34,602 --> 00:15:37,662
I cannot have an inter-cheeracial
relationship!

277
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,333
Hello?

278
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:42,497
Greetings,Camp Spirit Thunder.

279
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:44,765
just a friendly video postcard
from Camp Victory.

280
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:47,474
Looking very forward to seeing
you in the Championships.

281
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:49,407
We've got a secret weapon this year.

282
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:51,752
Say, Pepper, how many of your
kids can throw

283
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:54,978
a roundoff, back handspring
double-fold twist?

284
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:56,275
Oh, none?

285
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,463
Meet the new and improved Flamingos.

286
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:01,386
See you at the...

287
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:02,891
The Flamingos?

288
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,592
They can barely stand on one leg.

289
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:08,932
Everybody,it is all right.

290
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:13,301
Vance Voorhees is just trying
to psyche us out. Okay?

291
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:16,502
And it didn't work last year,
and it's not gonna work this year.

292
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:18,336
We always win.

293
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,277
Nothing's gonna stop us this week.

294
00:16:20,347 --> 00:16:22,407
Except the Sharks.

295
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,752
Your little trick's not gonna
work, Brooke.

296
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,788
Making sure I knew Penn was a Jet

297
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:28,753
makes it that much easier to
resist him.

298
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,290
I'm no player,but I thought
I had a little game.

299
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:35,289
Sorry, Penn,but I've only got
one thing on my mind,

300
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:37,732
and that is crushing your squad.

301
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:41,462
Not even in your dreams, Carson.

302
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:44,327
We're done here. Let's go.

303
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,935
Hey, can you go on spiritaccessories. com

304
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:58,075
and see if they have the key
chains that light up?

305
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:03,249
If pink is the new black,what's the new pink?

306
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,662
Aeysha, I'm trying to work here.

307
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:09,963
I have to find a killer stunt
that'll knock East Coast on their spanks.

308
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,220
Sorry.

309
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,164
It doesn't matter.

310
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:15,793
I can't concentrate anyway.

311
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:24,684
Hey, you need to get serious,
'cause I don't care how cute he is,

312
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:26,844
we are here to win, right?

313
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:28,613
True that, sister, yo.

314
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:32,945
Girl, go to sleep. Tomorrow is
gonna be fun.

315
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:46,057
Five, six, seven, eight.

316
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:49,621
Come on. My granny can jump higher
than that from her grave.

317
00:17:49,703 --> 00:17:52,103
...seven, eight, one.

318
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:54,072
Okay, Sarah,you're up.

319
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,970
Let's have a little spirit this time.

320
00:17:56,675 --> 00:18:00,735
1st and 10,do it again. Go, go

321
00:18:00,815 --> 00:18:02,505
All right, Ruben,you're up.

322
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:07,992
P- E-A-C-E.Peace to the Middle
East Go, planet!

323
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:09,524
He can't do that,can he?

324
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:12,989
I mean, if he cheers for peace,
then the terrorists win! Duh!

325
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:26,256
Showmanship.

326
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:28,329
That's what sells the performance.

327
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:32,107
So, I want everyone to give me big facials.

328
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:34,078
Because you have to remember

329
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:38,636
that points will be deducted
for bad facials, okay?

330
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:43,612
All right. All right,you guys, now.

331
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:46,090
Any of those dance moves can
be used in a cheer routine.

332
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:48,148
Since when is dance a part of
cheerleading,anyway?

333
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:51,888
Since the world first started
recognizing that cheerleading was real.

334
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:53,555
I mean, think about it, you guys.

335
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,193
If you've got some dope cheerleading,

336
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:56,667
you're throwing some hot dance moves

337
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:58,065
and you got some crazy tumbling.

338
00:18:58,138 --> 00:18:59,368
What do you have?

339
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:00,599
You got a triple threat, right?

340
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:03,013
Triple threat right here.

341
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:04,336
Yo, I got this.

342
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,100
Okay. Okay. Bring it, boo.

343
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,519
Ain't like they can hang when a sister

344
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:22,252
gets to cracking and popping
her collarbone.

345
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,787
You smell me?

346
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,690
What the hell are you doing?

347
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,831
I'm keeping it real,sister.

348
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,372
Keeping it real for who?

349
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:33,927
You need to just be you, okay,
boo?Just be you.

350
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,000
I love it when we win

351
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:42,908
The only thing that's better is
when it's twice as long

352
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:45,112
And I get a double-header

353
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:47,345
Your cart.

354
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:55,360
First of all, we're gonna start
with happy,happy, happy.

355
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:57,658
We're so happy to be here. Good.

356
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,820
All right, now,surprise.

357
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,562
What just happened?I don't know
but it was wonderful.

358
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:07,766
Uh-oh! Here comes the big wink
for you in the back, judge.

359
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,280
Big wink. There we go.

360
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:17,014
Come on, girl. Sunshine,I have
seen better facials at a funeral

361
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:19,752
and I'm talking about the corpses.

362
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:21,479
Oh, we like that,do we?

363
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,823
Well, let's just make that smile...

364
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,960
Oh, gosh. Okay, all right.

365
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:28,515
Well, the workshop is over.

366
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,701
Do just one facial. Come on.

367
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:45,335
If you hate cheerleading so much,
why do you do it?

368
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,000
For Satan.

369
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,020
That's a shiny nugget I did not need to know.

370
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,965
It's just like yoga, you know.

371
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:53,541
It is.

372
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:58,847
Satan is my car.

373
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:03,588
My parents promised me payments
and insurance if I join the squad.

374
00:21:03,663 --> 00:21:07,363
Well, my parents promised me a
car if I stop cheerleading.

375
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:11,103
And if I nail a girl, I get my
own apartment.

376
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:12,659
See, that was almost a facial.

377
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:14,969
Yeah, in Transylvania.

378
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:16,272
Step off, Brooke.

379
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:18,312
Who are you?Her fairy Goth-mother?

380
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:22,008
Brooke, get over yourself,
and stop sweating my team.

381
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:24,311
Why would anyone listen to you?

382
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:27,184
You suck as a gymnast and
a captain, too.

383
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,716
Cheer-off. Sharks!

384
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:30,849
Yeah.

385
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:32,913
Five, six, seven, eight.

386
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:35,392
It don't matter what we do

387
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,761
Music, baby, is our cue

388
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:40,090
Hands and shoulders,face so tight

389
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,256
All our moves will rock this fight

390
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:45,304
Our moves are tight,we lift with ease

391
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:48,240
The things we do will make you wheeze

392
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:51,038
So watch us strike our muscle pose

393
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:53,639
While you all prance and dosey-doe

394
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:55,812
That was cute,your pose was dull

395
00:21:55,882 --> 00:21:58,322
But all of you have belly rolls

396
00:21:58,383 --> 00:22:00,583
Once again we groove with flare

397
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,782
The moves we do,you wouldn't dare

398
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:05,085
So listen quick while your
face gets cracked

399
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:06,918
One, two, three, you're wack

400
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,023
Your rhymes are fun, but we're still good

401
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:11,255
We still can stunt,you're from the hood

402
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,660
Hood rats, good rats,what are you called?

403
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:16,223
The moves you do won't win at all

404
00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:18,402
So listen quick, oops

405
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:21,531
You said that rhyme One, two,
three, our time

406
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:24,366
Motions, motions,hear them roar

407
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:27,144
No one's knocking at your door

408
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:29,373
With no rhythm and with no sass

409
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:31,509
All of you can kiss our ass

410
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:33,784
Dance, 10, looks, 3

411
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:36,343
The moves you do make us all pee

412
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:39,121
We laugh, we cry,we all say hi

413
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:41,852
'Cause when you dance,it's bye, bye, bye

414
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:43,357
Bye, bye

415
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:44,419
Bye.

416
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:45,556
Bye. Have fun.

417
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,538
Bye.

418
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:01,338
Yo, that was shady,Brooke.

419
00:23:01,414 --> 00:23:03,614
Please, you totally popped a chubber.

420
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:04,712
Hey, Brooke.

421
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:05,773
What?

422
00:23:05,852 --> 00:23:07,912
You've got no clue,you're in the dark

423
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:09,387
Wake up call,it's the year of the...

424
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:30,705
Come on, babycakes.

425
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:34,676
If we all just imagine this world's
a fabulous place, it'll happen.

426
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:41,184
I see children frolicking under
a rainbow eating hormone-free treats.

427
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,445
A unicorn.

428
00:23:45,858 --> 00:23:51,818
I see mutant turtles gnawing
on festering human flesh.

429
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,597
They ate the unicorn.

430
00:23:58,704 --> 00:24:01,234
You need Jesus. Or Prozac.

431
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:05,308
Thanks for trying to cheer me up, Ruben,

432
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:07,845
but I'm more mad at myself than Brooke.

433
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:10,184
I let her get to me.

434
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:11,979
That's why we lost the cheer-off.

435
00:24:12,052 --> 00:24:14,082
Yeah, that bites.

436
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:16,249
You gonna finish that steak?

437
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:33,330
Spirit to you.

438
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:38,133
Hey, I heard you had kind of
a rough day, huh?

439
00:24:38,211 --> 00:24:40,641
But your luck's about to change.

440
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:42,512
Okay. All right.

441
00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:45,612
Oh, West Coast Sharks,may the
luck of Herkie

442
00:24:45,685 --> 00:24:48,645
smile on you as it has for me.

443
00:24:48,955 --> 00:24:50,445
Go Sharks

444
00:24:51,057 --> 00:24:52,577
Go Sharks

445
00:24:53,192 --> 00:24:54,662
Go Sharks

446
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:57,021
Go Sharks

447
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:59,216
Go Sharks

448
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,322
Go Sharks

449
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,590
Go Sharks

450
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:05,263
Go Sharks

451
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:12,171
Okay, guys, we got to give props
to the spirits,

452
00:25:12,379 --> 00:25:14,069
but isn't this a little extreme?

453
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:16,705
You know how nasty some cheerleaders
can be when they're alive.

454
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:18,982
Do you really want to risk the
dead ones hating on you?

455
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:22,151
Then let's do this right. Look, off.

456
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:29,816
Fire, water, earth,air, spirit stick.

457
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:33,763
You know what this really needs to pop?

458
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:37,003
The blood of a virgin.

459
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,370
Okay. Why are you guys looking at me?

460
00:25:43,442 --> 00:25:46,342
Come on, Carson, just a little pin prick.

461
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:49,971
If she can take a little prick,
she wouldn't be a virgin.

462
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:53,641
You coming?

463
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:54,848
Hell to the yeah.

464
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:56,051
Where?

465
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:57,921
You wouldn't be into it.

466
00:25:57,989 --> 00:26:00,049
Cheer poker with the Prairie Dogs.

467
00:26:00,126 --> 00:26:01,816
What's the buy-in?

468
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:03,693
Sarah, this is cheer poker.

469
00:26:03,763 --> 00:26:06,203
Sounds like easy pickings. Wait.

470
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:08,285
Who's gonna guard the spirit stick?

471
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,900
You know what? You guys go.

472
00:26:12,972 --> 00:26:15,442
I'm captain, I'll do stick duty.

473
00:26:15,508 --> 00:26:16,738
Thanks. Thanks, boo.

474
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:18,169
What room is the poker game?

475
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:20,244
Dumpy Dogs have a suite.

476
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:54,409
Why can't I delete you?

477
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:09,364
Down here.

478
00:27:09,595 --> 00:27:10,645
Penn, what are you doing?

479
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,130
Well, you don't answer my calls and texts,

480
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:15,457
so I had to do it old school
and show up in person.

481
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,368
Don't make me serenade you.

482
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:19,125
Penn, you're a Jet. We can't...

483
00:27:19,205 --> 00:27:21,935
I know. I know. Look,let's
just do the rides.

484
00:27:22,009 --> 00:27:24,669
No cheer talk. I promise.

485
00:27:24,744 --> 00:27:25,974
The Double-Dragon?

486
00:27:26,045 --> 00:27:28,265
Now you're talking. I'll meet you.

487
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:30,448
Cradle.

488
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:56,027
That was sick!

489
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:57,935
You had fun,didn't you?

490
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,940
Hey! I know how to play, bro.

491
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,071
Mmm-hmm.

492
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:04,306
What? I take cheering seriously.

493
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:06,183
You know,my team's counting on me.

494
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:08,147
I'm not gonna let them down.

495
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,750
Word on the street? It's just summer camp.

496
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:13,623
Yeah, maybe for you.

497
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:15,523
We worked our butts off just to get here.

498
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:17,447
So did we.

499
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,059
And we had to raise a lot of money.

500
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:22,902
You know, wet T-shirt car washes.

501
00:28:23,436 --> 00:28:25,556
Trust me. I know.

502
00:28:25,638 --> 00:28:29,098
Anyways, winning a competition like this,

503
00:28:29,175 --> 00:28:32,135
it could really up my chance of
getting a scholarship to college.

504
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,481
I even had to get a team scholarship
just to get here.

505
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:36,337
Yeah, so did I.

506
00:28:36,415 --> 00:28:38,905
You know, it's nothing to be ashamed of.

507
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:40,284
In my case, it is.

508
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:41,552
What do you mean?

509
00:28:43,923 --> 00:28:45,453
Look, don't get all serious on me, skids.

510
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:47,013
Come on.

511
00:28:50,696 --> 00:28:53,316
You fumbled on the flop We'll
trick you on the turn

512
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:56,229
Now here comes the river and the P-Dog burn!

513
00:28:56,302 --> 00:28:59,702
You Dogs think you can fool us
Sharks at poker faces.

514
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:04,036
You are so bluffing,Prairie Dog.
I call.

515
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,440
Trip cowboys. I beat that.

516
00:29:06,512 --> 00:29:09,542
How about my three bullets shoot
down your cowboys?

517
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:11,135
P- Dogs rule!

518
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:13,946
Oh, yeah? How about a Texas
titty twister on the house?

519
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:16,849
Hey, what are you doing?
Oh, no, what the...

520
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:19,082
Go, go. Oh, no, we got them.

521
00:29:19,158 --> 00:29:20,518
We got his shorts.

522
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:24,415
Look, shark.

523
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:28,759
A world tour is no big deal to me.

524
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:30,834
I've been overseas my whole life.

525
00:29:30,903 --> 00:29:34,273
Well, if you win again,
you can get a cheer scholarship, too.

526
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,900
To West Point?

527
00:29:36,876 --> 00:29:38,836
Okay, wait, why would you go there?

528
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:40,967
You're a musician and a dancer.

529
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:45,811
Yeah, well, my father is a son
of immigrants,

530
00:29:45,885 --> 00:29:47,975
and they came from nothing.

531
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:49,653
And after he made a career out
of the military,

532
00:29:49,722 --> 00:29:51,162
he had everything.

533
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:53,822
So, all his sons went to West Point.

534
00:29:53,893 --> 00:29:57,023
There's five of us, and well,
I'm the last one.

535
00:29:57,263 --> 00:30:01,103
So, my parents, well,
my father expects it.

536
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:02,787
Well, can't you talk to him?

537
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:05,858
I mean, won't he let you cheer
somewhere else?

538
00:30:07,373 --> 00:30:09,243
Wait. He doesn't know?

539
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:11,704
My dad would spew a colon.

540
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:15,403
I kind of told him I joined
the tae kwon do team.

541
00:30:17,016 --> 00:30:20,006
Can I tell you a secret,
but just between us?

542
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:21,205
Sure.

543
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,330
What?

544
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:36,955
Even though my family has money,
I took a team scholarship

545
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:41,405
because I didn't want him to
find out about Cheer Camp.

546
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,400
Wow. Well, does your team know?

547
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,504
Weak, huh?

548
00:30:51,984 --> 00:30:54,954
So, where does your dad think you are now?

549
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,050
Extreme Warrior Martial Arts Camp.

550
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,120
He watched me pack my nunchuks.

551
00:31:14,773 --> 00:31:17,073
Whoa, you sharks do stick together.

552
00:31:23,949 --> 00:31:25,809
Yeah, get it, get it.

553
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:33,649
Move it. Come on, honey.

554
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:43,189
Oh, go get Carson.

555
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:45,128
Honey, that girl can wear a thong.

556
00:31:45,204 --> 00:31:46,874
Yeah, my girl needs to learn to hang.

557
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:48,665
But we need to take this show to my crib.

558
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,370
She's guarding the stick there.

559
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:52,932
Come on, you all, let's go. Let's go.

560
00:32:02,554 --> 00:32:04,384
Yo, Carson dipped out.

561
00:32:04,823 --> 00:32:06,553
And took the stick.

562
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:08,246
Where?

563
00:32:09,161 --> 00:32:10,591
Maybe my girl learned to hang.

564
00:32:10,663 --> 00:32:12,633
Come on, let's go find her.

565
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:19,828
You know, I should really get going.

566
00:32:19,905 --> 00:32:21,595
I just told you my darkest secret.

567
00:32:21,674 --> 00:32:23,574
Yeah, I know, but...

568
00:32:23,643 --> 00:32:28,173
Look, when was the last time
you just danced for fun?

569
00:32:28,247 --> 00:32:31,237
Without being thrown in the air
every few seconds?

570
00:32:32,318 --> 00:32:34,378
A bar mitzvah three years ago.

571
00:32:59,044 --> 00:33:01,844
So, Jet boy thinks he can handle
West Coast moves?

572
00:33:01,915 --> 00:33:04,505
I think Shark girl's asking the
wrong question.

573
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:42,916
No, Carson wouldn't bring it here.

574
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:44,287
Too many haters.

575
00:33:44,357 --> 00:33:46,257
Where else can we look?

576
00:33:48,494 --> 00:33:50,394
I think I have an idea.

577
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,499
Carson!

578
00:34:15,454 --> 00:34:16,484
Oh, no.

579
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:17,535
What?

580
00:34:17,624 --> 00:34:19,524
I'm about to have a secret, too.

581
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,920
Carson!

582
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,290
What are you guys doing here?

583
00:34:23,362 --> 00:34:25,892
Us? You need to check yourself.

584
00:34:25,964 --> 00:34:27,524
We were just hanging out.

585
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,999
Carson, give us back the spirit stick.

586
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,868
You junk up its karma around
here with all these civilians.

587
00:34:32,938 --> 00:34:34,198
Ruben, it's in our room.

588
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:35,472
No, it's not.

589
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,640
Why do you think we're out here
looking for you?

590
00:34:38,944 --> 00:34:42,314
Somebody jacked it, and now we
know for sure who.

591
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,680
Jets!

592
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:48,013
jets kick ass from east to west

593
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:50,377
And speaking of coincidence...

594
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:52,315
You lost the spirit stick.

595
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,550
Ooh! You Sharks are tuna.

596
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:55,816
Just give it back.

597
00:34:55,894 --> 00:34:58,954
Carson, this isn't a Jets prank.

598
00:34:59,031 --> 00:35:00,501
I wouldn't scam you like this.

599
00:35:00,566 --> 00:35:02,496
Come on, Carson, it's just a
big coincidence

600
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,427
how he got you out of your room

601
00:35:04,503 --> 00:35:05,993
and then the spirit stick was stolen.

602
00:35:06,072 --> 00:35:09,632
Seems wrong he didn't tell you
he was a Jet when he met you.

603
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:11,637
That's right. This has cheer bitch's

604
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,610
skanky paw prints all over it!

605
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:15,239
Don't let them play us again, Carson.

606
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:16,844
It's our year, remember?

607
00:35:16,916 --> 00:35:18,466
This is so whack. Look, Carson.

608
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:20,539
I'll help you look for the
stupid stick, all right?

609
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:21,949
What?Stupid stick?

610
00:35:22,021 --> 00:35:24,281
Yeah. I'll help you look, too.

611
00:35:25,224 --> 00:35:26,714
Look, don't get all crazy
about this, okay?

612
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:28,262
No, it's not okay.

613
00:35:28,327 --> 00:35:30,557
How can I trust someone who
lies to his own team?

614
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:31,649
Carson.

615
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:32,920
You know, he didn't need you guys

616
00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:34,688
to raise travel money for the trip.

617
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:37,895
He was too scared to tell his
dad about Cheer Camp.

618
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:40,030
She's a liar,right, Penn?

619
00:35:43,075 --> 00:35:45,165
No, Brooke. I should have just
believed you

620
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:48,653
when you said Sharks and Jets
were sworn enemies.

621
00:35:48,715 --> 00:35:50,475
Now I know why.

622
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:53,051
You showed your true colors, didn't you?

623
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:55,548
And you showed you're just a Jet.

624
00:35:57,756 --> 00:36:00,016
Have fun being cursed, losers.

625
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:05,391
Hey, we sold candy bars for you, dude.

626
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,560
I'll pay you back the money, okay?

627
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:14,099
But those Butterfingers were heavy.

628
00:36:17,976 --> 00:36:19,136
Hey, Pepper.

629
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,910
Heard the Sharks totally lost
the spirit stick.

630
00:36:21,046 --> 00:36:22,026
What?

631
00:36:26,118 --> 00:36:27,138
Yeah, they're over there.

632
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:28,309
Thank you. Thank you so much.

633
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:29,646
See you.

634
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:42,288
Uh-oh.

635
00:36:43,168 --> 00:36:47,538
So it's true. You lost my spirit stick.

636
00:36:47,606 --> 00:36:49,336
Pepper, I'm sorry. Look,
I got distracted...

637
00:36:49,408 --> 00:36:52,238
Well, it was up to you to guard
it with your lives.

638
00:36:52,311 --> 00:36:53,641
We'll find it, Pepper.

639
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:54,972
Oh, you better.

640
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:57,607
Yeah, so, on the real,
what happens if we don't?

641
00:36:57,683 --> 00:36:58,783
Oh, who knows?

642
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:01,320
You remember that cheerleader
I was telling you about?

643
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,005
Well, after she broke her leg,

644
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:06,111
her entire team got some kind
of nasty stomach virus,

645
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:09,560
and they all vomited on the
competition floor, all right?

646
00:37:09,628 --> 00:37:11,928
And, needless to say,everyone was happy

647
00:37:11,997 --> 00:37:14,227
to see them go home the next day,

648
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:16,429
including the judges.

649
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:22,061
Okay, stop! We are not cursed.

650
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:23,799
Not even the spirit stick gods

651
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:25,495
can take this victory away from us.

652
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,407
We are going to win, damn it.

653
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:29,309
Pyramid, seven, eight.

654
00:37:29,381 --> 00:37:31,211
One, two, three and four, five, six...

655
00:37:31,283 --> 00:37:32,513
Hey.

656
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,888
You guys, get up!

657
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:40,519
This is one fast-acting curse.

658
00:37:40,993 --> 00:37:42,523
Hey!

659
00:38:22,868 --> 00:38:24,228
Damn curse.

660
00:38:40,686 --> 00:38:42,176
Are those the Sharks? Yeah.

661
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:45,461
Don't let them touch you.

662
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:49,986
Let the curse be with you!

663
00:38:58,204 --> 00:39:00,364
This is all the money I've got
on me right now.

664
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:03,501
So I can give you the rest as
soon as I can, all right?

665
00:39:03,576 --> 00:39:05,806
That's not what I care about.

666
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,511
So, what's your deal, Penn?

667
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:13,182
Do you want to be here or not?

668
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:15,911
At this minute, not so much.

669
00:39:15,987 --> 00:39:17,147
I'm serious.

670
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:19,121
We want to win.

671
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:22,021
Now you know what kind of snakes
those Sharks really are.

672
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:25,096
Yeah. They're like snarks.

673
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:27,156
The enemy.

674
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:30,389
Yeah, I get it, Chelsea.

675
00:39:30,469 --> 00:39:31,959
Do you?

676
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:36,267
Look, I get it. You're not into me.
Nothing's gonna happen.

677
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:39,198
But it will happen for this team.

678
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:42,266
And the only way it's gonna work
is if we do this together.

679
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:43,506
Yeah.

680
00:39:43,582 --> 00:39:46,522
So, you're like with us or what?

681
00:39:46,586 --> 00:39:50,036
"j" to the "E" to the "T"
to the "S"

682
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:53,181
jets kick ass from east to west!

683
00:39:53,258 --> 00:39:54,848
You know they stole the stick.

684
00:39:54,926 --> 00:39:58,356
It don't matter who took it,
we got to bust a cap in this curse.

685
00:39:58,430 --> 00:39:59,830
Even Ruben thinks so now.

686
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:02,928
You know what?I think
it's time for Sarah to do her thing.

687
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:06,731
A cheer sacrifice?Has it really
come to that?

688
00:40:06,805 --> 00:40:10,165
Well, if it'll get us a win,
we'll do it at midnight.

689
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:24,919
O mighty fallen cheer angels,

690
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:27,689
we summon thee from darkness.

691
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,729
We're sorry about your spirit stick,

692
00:40:29,795 --> 00:40:33,555
but shouldn't you be cursing
the skanky succubae that stole it?

693
00:40:33,632 --> 00:40:34,932
Not us.

694
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,230
While you process our request,

695
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:41,102
will you please accept our sacrifices?

696
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:43,202
Go, spirits!

697
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:47,741
It wouldn't hurt.

698
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:04,693
Girl! Your lucky strapless?

699
00:41:04,763 --> 00:41:07,203
If you love something, set it free.

700
00:41:10,936 --> 00:41:14,496
Oh, my God. The cheer spirits are here.

701
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:16,542
They don't sound cheerful.

702
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:19,526
Maybe it was just the wind.

703
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:28,123
That's for trying to get us
cursed, freaks!

704
00:41:28,186 --> 00:41:29,586
Yeah, except that you don't deserve.

705
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:32,523
Like we need to steal the spirit
stick to win.

706
00:41:32,591 --> 00:41:35,991
You couldn't even beat me in
a cheer-off, loser.

707
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,120
All right, that's it. You want
a real battle?

708
00:41:38,196 --> 00:41:40,186
Sharks and Jets,right now.

709
00:41:40,265 --> 00:41:42,125
Fair fight. No contact.

710
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,430
Cheer rumble!

711
00:41:43,502 --> 00:41:44,632
Let's go.

712
00:41:44,703 --> 00:41:46,173
Yeah, let's go,you guys. Let's do this.

713
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:48,427
Come on, you guys,go around the corner.

714
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:50,667
Come on, guys, let's go.

715
00:41:50,742 --> 00:41:51,832
Hey, snarks.

716
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:52,929
Bring it.

717
00:42:22,073 --> 00:42:23,203
Jets!

718
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,510
Sharks!

719
00:42:36,488 --> 00:42:37,578
Jets!

720
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,320
Sharks!

721
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,800
Pyramid! Higher!

722
00:43:22,534 --> 00:43:25,834
What happened tonight is an all-time,

723
00:43:25,904 --> 00:43:30,074
an all-time low for Camp Spirit Thunder!

724
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:34,080
You've just ruined this camp's
chances against Vance.

725
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:35,634
And, even worse,

726
00:43:35,714 --> 00:43:37,514
you lost my spirit stick.

727
00:43:37,582 --> 00:43:39,552
Brooke, give Pepper back her spirit stick.

728
00:43:39,618 --> 00:43:41,378
Hey, loser,if I had the stick,

729
00:43:41,453 --> 00:43:42,983
why would my team have gotten hurt?

730
00:43:43,054 --> 00:43:44,684
Because your team started the rumble.

731
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:47,488
You don't even deserve...

732
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:49,459
Enough!

733
00:43:49,527 --> 00:43:54,487
You kids have let down yourselves,
your camp and your country.

734
00:43:54,566 --> 00:43:55,856
Take a look around.

735
00:43:55,934 --> 00:43:59,104
Neither of you have enough team
members to compete now.

736
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:01,470
So in the morning, when you get up,

737
00:44:01,573 --> 00:44:04,773
there'll be buses here waiting
to take you all home.

738
00:44:04,843 --> 00:44:06,173
Good night!

739
00:44:14,619 --> 00:44:18,449
Tomorrow, we need to whip those
little Prairie Dogs into shape.

740
00:44:18,523 --> 00:44:21,723
Then girlfriend,you'd better
pray for a miracle.

741
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:00,246
Let's just go home and pretend

742
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,360
this whole sorry trip never happened.

743
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:08,300
What a nightmare.

744
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,576
Where's the
spirit stick?

745
00:45:20,652 --> 00:45:23,212
Brooke, I know
you have it.

746
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:25,947
You're still the rock star of stupid.

747
00:45:26,025 --> 00:45:28,215
Why would I keep the stick and
stay cursed?

748
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:30,282
Can we all just get over it?

749
00:45:30,361 --> 00:45:32,521
Even Paris and Nicole settled their...

750
00:45:32,597 --> 00:45:34,217
Shut up, Ruben!

751
00:45:37,302 --> 00:45:38,832
Pepper?

752
00:45:39,804 --> 00:45:45,804
Run! Flip! Jump high!You dissed
the spirits,and die, die, die!

753
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:47,436
Pepper, let go!

754
00:45:56,454 --> 00:45:58,354
What the hell?

755
00:45:58,423 --> 00:46:00,053
Brooke didn't steal the spirit stick.

756
00:46:00,125 --> 00:46:02,215
She would've given it back by
now to get rid of the curse.

757
00:46:02,293 --> 00:46:05,093
Whatever! She is still a sick
individual.

758
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:09,122
Now, just go to sleep. I don't
need any more drama tonight, okay?

759
00:46:12,303 --> 00:46:16,433
But that means Penn had nothing
to do with it, either.

760
00:46:46,671 --> 00:46:48,301
You guys,we can't leave like this.

761
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:49,972
It's like we're giving up.

762
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:52,101
I promised you guys a win,

763
00:46:52,177 --> 00:46:54,807
and we're going to get one.

764
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,107
Pretty.

765
00:47:07,692 --> 00:47:09,962
Brooke,I don't think you stole
the spirit stick anymore.

766
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:12,717
Like I give a flying tuck what you think.

767
00:47:12,831 --> 00:47:14,131
Well, I do think you want to win

768
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:15,759
Camp Championships as much as I do.

769
00:47:15,834 --> 00:47:17,134
So what?

770
00:47:17,202 --> 00:47:18,672
Well, if there was any chance
to stay and compete,

771
00:47:18,736 --> 00:47:20,166
you'd consider it, right?

772
00:47:20,238 --> 00:47:21,728
Even if it meant coming together.

773
00:47:22,106 --> 00:47:23,466
Ew! That's like cheer-cest!

774
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:26,170
Chelsea, I meant combining our teams.

775
00:47:26,377 --> 00:47:27,967
Look, it's about not quitting.

776
00:47:28,046 --> 00:47:30,166
Pepper wants her camp to win,
I think she'll help us.

777
00:47:30,248 --> 00:47:31,508
Brilliant plan, Carson.

778
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:33,783
Look, I think the Jets are already
on the spirits' hit list.

779
00:47:33,852 --> 00:47:36,182
Because of you.

780
00:47:36,254 --> 00:47:40,124
Okay, well,if we leave now,
we'll all stay cursed.

781
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:41,781
Come on, Brooke.

782
00:47:45,964 --> 00:47:48,404
Boo that, freak!We're out of here.

783
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,130
Penn?

784
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:01,470
Look, I'm sorry for...

785
00:48:01,546 --> 00:48:03,876
Well, it's kind of a long list.

786
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,206
Later, Carson.

787
00:48:08,921 --> 00:48:10,791
You can call me skids!

788
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,385
What?

789
00:48:18,463 --> 00:48:21,163
You wanted me to say yes to
Hilary Duff light?

790
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:22,632
Strap on a pair, Penn.

791
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:24,070
Can I borrow yours?

792
00:48:24,135 --> 00:48:26,725
Don't even try to out-bitch me.

793
00:48:26,804 --> 00:48:29,244
Yeah. Brooke's like the
Olym-bitch champion.

794
00:48:29,307 --> 00:48:30,467
No doubt.

795
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:32,101
I just never pegged you for a quitter.

796
00:48:32,176 --> 00:48:33,696
I'm not quitting, Penn.

797
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:36,207
I'm embracing my future.

798
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,080
Which is freaking bright!

799
00:48:38,148 --> 00:48:40,048
Everyone says so.

800
00:48:40,118 --> 00:48:42,418
They say a lot of other stuff
about her, too, you know.

801
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:44,106
Shut up, Chelsea!

802
00:49:01,606 --> 00:49:02,826
Okay, we're in.

803
00:49:02,907 --> 00:49:04,067
Yes.

804
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:08,006
I'm captain, of course.

805
00:49:09,247 --> 00:49:11,177
You two perform together?

806
00:49:11,249 --> 00:49:13,619
In what? A cheer death match?

807
00:49:13,686 --> 00:49:15,046
No. We would be...

808
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:17,018
Co-captains.

809
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:20,780
Pepper, even with only half
our squads,

810
00:49:20,857 --> 00:49:23,117
we've still got the best
cheerleaders in camp.

811
00:49:23,194 --> 00:49:27,154
Hey, P-Dog! It is only a jump
if your feet come off the ground.

812
00:49:27,231 --> 00:49:28,531
Okay, hon?Whatever.

813
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:31,299
Pep, I'm trying to tell you,
these Prairie Dogs are so bad,

814
00:49:31,369 --> 00:49:33,099
they can't even roll over.

815
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:35,200
Don't give up on them yet.

816
00:49:36,007 --> 00:49:40,567
Come on, you all. One, two, three,
four,five, six, seven, eight.

817
00:49:40,645 --> 00:49:43,805
Two, two, three, four...

818
00:49:45,817 --> 00:49:49,747
We are the Flamingos!We are
the Flamingos!

819
00:49:49,821 --> 00:49:51,911
Look. Please give us a second chance.

820
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,389
Sorry, don't believe in those,
angel pants. So you all just...

821
00:49:54,459 --> 00:49:56,159
We are the Flamingos!

822
00:49:56,228 --> 00:49:59,988
We are the Flamingos!We are
the Flamingos!

823
00:50:00,064 --> 00:50:01,124
Damn.

824
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:03,389
No Flamingo could throw down
like that last year.

825
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:06,487
Get out of my camp,Voorhees!

826
00:50:06,571 --> 00:50:08,441
Hey, we're just passing through,ma'am.

827
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:10,835
Don't get your scort in a twist.

828
00:50:12,677 --> 00:50:16,507
Wouldn't it be fun to,like,
rip him a new one in Championships?

829
00:50:18,416 --> 00:50:20,466
All right, you guys. We called
you out here to tell you

830
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,380
that Pepper got us approved
with the council.

831
00:50:22,453 --> 00:50:24,393
And now all we need is a new name.

832
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:26,554
I was thinking the East-West Spirit?

833
00:50:26,624 --> 00:50:28,924
Ain't that an Amtrak train?

834
00:50:28,993 --> 00:50:32,953
Why can't we have a cool name,
like TomKat or Bennifer?

835
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,690
How about the Jarks?

836
00:50:34,767 --> 00:50:36,627
How about

837
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:38,071
the Sharts?

838
00:50:40,605 --> 00:50:42,295
How about the Shets?

839
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:45,933
I mean, I don't see you guys
coming up with something better.

840
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:48,099
All right. We're the Shets.

841
00:50:48,179 --> 00:50:50,479
Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm. This ain't gonna work.

842
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:52,168
Remember what happened to Tupac
and Biggie?

843
00:50:52,249 --> 00:50:53,909
We'll make it work.

844
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:55,454
We're combining the best parts
of both routines,

845
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:56,540
so get up!Get up. Up, guys.

846
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:59,220
Come on, you guys,positions. Get up!

847
00:51:07,965 --> 00:51:10,015
Penn and Chelsea,get in the back.

848
00:51:11,269 --> 00:51:13,829
I so don't do the back row.
Tell her, Brooke.

849
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:17,314
Why doesn't Goth-a-sauraus
step to the back?

850
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:19,265
Because Goth...

851
00:51:19,343 --> 00:51:21,333
Sarah can dance her little ass off.

852
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:23,572
Now let's try this. Come on.

853
00:51:26,184 --> 00:51:27,674
Chels, please.

854
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,557
Five, six, seven, eight.

855
00:51:32,623 --> 00:51:36,793
One, two, three, four,five, six,
seven and eight.

856
00:51:36,861 --> 00:51:38,561
Ready? Try it.

857
00:51:38,663 --> 00:51:40,693
Five, six, seven, eight.

858
00:51:40,765 --> 00:51:44,755
One, two, three,four, five,
six. Two more.

859
00:51:44,837 --> 00:51:48,767
One, two, three,four, five,
six... Last one.

860
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:52,830
One, two, three, four,five, six,
seven and eight.

861
00:51:54,745 --> 00:51:56,105
I got this.

862
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,947
All right, everybody,that was
great. We got the fever.

863
00:52:10,027 --> 00:52:12,287
Yeah, bite me.

864
00:52:12,363 --> 00:52:13,993
You're doing great, honey.

865
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:20,890
Hey, Penn.

866
00:52:20,972 --> 00:52:22,002
I...

867
00:52:22,073 --> 00:52:23,973
I'll be back before next practice.

868
00:52:24,041 --> 00:52:25,771
You know, I was hoping that
we could talk.

869
00:52:25,843 --> 00:52:27,613
And by talk I mean,

870
00:52:27,678 --> 00:52:30,698
you know, I thought that maybe
we could have a do-over.

871
00:52:30,781 --> 00:52:34,551
Do-over? Carson,I think we're done.

872
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:38,678
Look, Penn, I'm sorry I accused
you of stealing the spirit stick,

873
00:52:38,757 --> 00:52:40,987
and, of course,embarrassing you

874
00:52:41,058 --> 00:52:43,248
and telling everyone your darkest secret.

875
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:45,087
That was bad, but...

876
00:52:47,098 --> 00:52:49,188
This could be going better.

877
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,130
Look, Carson,I'm gonna work my
ass off to help our team win.

878
00:52:54,205 --> 00:52:55,725
But you and me,

879
00:52:55,806 --> 00:52:57,426
I think we should stick to our
own coasts.

880
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:59,097
All right?

881
00:53:04,515 --> 00:53:07,135
Seven, eight.

882
00:53:07,218 --> 00:53:13,878
One, two, three, four,five, six,
seven, eight.

883
00:53:15,393 --> 00:53:22,923
One, two, three, four,five, six,
seven, eight.

884
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:39,635
Tight work.

885
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:00,803
Hey!

886
00:54:08,713 --> 00:54:10,153
Pepper's lost her mind.

887
00:54:10,214 --> 00:54:12,554
I think she put out an AMBER
Alert, too.

888
00:54:12,617 --> 00:54:14,277
Man, I'd love to know who took it.

889
00:54:14,352 --> 00:54:17,122
I smell P-Dog.

890
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:18,377
No.

891
00:54:18,456 --> 00:54:19,916
I bet it was the Flamingos.

892
00:54:19,991 --> 00:54:22,981
Look, either way,let's just
hope the curse is done.

893
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:24,619
We need all the help we can get.

894
00:54:24,695 --> 00:54:25,955
You know what?You're right.

895
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:27,890
Let's practice our routine one more time.

896
00:54:29,634 --> 00:54:31,364
What? You guys! Ow!

897
00:54:50,888 --> 00:54:53,148
Get it, boy. You better work it.

898
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:20,950
Bet I can cheer you up.

899
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:24,252
Don't be a wad, Penn.

900
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:27,380
Go find Carson.

901
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:30,392
Excuse me?

902
00:55:30,461 --> 00:55:31,491
Yeah, I know.

903
00:55:31,562 --> 00:55:33,392
Never thought I'd say those words.

904
00:55:33,463 --> 00:55:37,563
But, hey, if you're into a bony
ass and cankles,then what the hell.

905
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:40,304
Knot up! Go get her, fool.

906
00:55:40,371 --> 00:55:42,531
Yeah, but after she ratted me out

907
00:55:42,606 --> 00:55:44,696
I can't make myself trust her, you know.

908
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:46,004
Why not?

909
00:55:46,944 --> 00:55:48,674
Damn.

910
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:50,365
I must be insane.

911
00:55:51,716 --> 00:55:53,736
Doesn't mean I have to be.

912
00:55:55,653 --> 00:55:57,553
Do what you want, Penn.

913
00:55:57,621 --> 00:55:59,991
But don't be a pendejo.

914
00:56:03,227 --> 00:56:05,557
Brooke, thanks.

915
00:56:08,866 --> 00:56:10,126
Whatever.

916
00:56:14,238 --> 00:56:15,798
By the way,

917
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:17,133
your loss.

918
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,937
I'm double-jointed.

919
00:56:22,813 --> 00:56:24,753
Five, six, seven, eight. One,
two, three, four,

920
00:56:24,815 --> 00:56:28,105
five, six, seven, eight. One,
two, three, four,

921
00:56:28,185 --> 00:56:29,735
five, six, seven, eight.

922
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:31,120
One, and two,and three, and four... Hey!

923
00:56:31,187 --> 00:56:33,417
Ever heard of this new thing
called counting?

924
00:56:33,491 --> 00:56:35,251
Everybody stretch! Now!

925
00:56:35,326 --> 00:56:37,286
Ever heard of team work?Shut up, Carson.

926
00:56:37,361 --> 00:56:38,591
Yo, watch it, cuz.

927
00:56:38,662 --> 00:56:39,862
Yo, stop fronting, cuz.

928
00:56:39,964 --> 00:56:41,594
I heard you with Chicago.

929
00:56:41,665 --> 00:56:43,215
You're not just an Oreo,Aeysha.

930
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:44,430
You're double-stuffed.

931
00:56:44,502 --> 00:56:45,592
You're wrong, Brooke!

932
00:56:45,669 --> 00:56:48,999
My girl, she been pulling
drive-bys since she was a shorty.

933
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,442
Yo, she was drinking 40s off
the nipple.

934
00:56:50,508 --> 00:56:51,598
Carson?

935
00:56:51,675 --> 00:56:53,665
So, don't be getting up on her
Kool-Aid, biatch,

936
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:55,473
'cause I have seen what she's done

937
00:56:55,546 --> 00:56:58,376
to fugly swamp donkeys like you,
fo shizzle.

938
00:56:59,282 --> 00:57:01,622
Carson, it's over.

939
00:57:01,685 --> 00:57:02,705
Are you sure?

940
00:57:02,787 --> 00:57:05,547
I cannot watch you "fo shizzle"
ever again.

941
00:57:07,191 --> 00:57:08,281
Good.

942
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:18,739
Look, you all. All this,"Girl,
please" and cursing,

943
00:57:18,804 --> 00:57:20,334
it ain't me.

944
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:22,303
I mean, it isn't me.

945
00:57:22,373 --> 00:57:24,843
I just did it to get your respect.

946
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:26,880
See, the real Aeysha got teased every day

947
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:28,914
in junior high for being an Oreo.

948
00:57:28,979 --> 00:57:32,609
You know,black on the outside,
white on the inside.

949
00:57:32,683 --> 00:57:35,213
And I've been hood ratting it
up ever since.

950
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:38,254
You're whiter than me.

951
00:57:38,322 --> 00:57:41,522
Maybe so, but,that's who I am.

952
00:57:41,592 --> 00:57:43,992
Just a black girl who enunciates.

953
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:48,490
Do you have something to say?

954
00:57:48,565 --> 00:57:52,225
Hey, if you want respect that badly,

955
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,362
just be a bitch, like me.

956
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,070
Same respect,half the effort.

957
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:00,425
Guess the bitch is out of the bag.

958
00:58:00,511 --> 00:58:02,001
Truth out!

959
00:58:05,049 --> 00:58:06,519
I'm a virgin.

960
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:12,144
Technically.

961
00:58:12,223 --> 00:58:14,623
I just act that way so guys
will like me.

962
00:58:14,691 --> 00:58:17,131
But it's really hard being slutty
all the time.

963
00:58:17,194 --> 00:58:19,684
I don't know how you do it, Brooke.

964
00:58:26,971 --> 00:58:30,911
My parents aren't bribing me
to be a cheerleader.

965
00:58:30,975 --> 00:58:34,035
I do it because cheerleading is dark

966
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:35,771
and twisted.

967
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:36,935
Are you high?

968
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:38,884
No. Think about it.

969
00:58:38,949 --> 00:58:40,379
We cheer for the other team's failure

970
00:58:40,452 --> 00:58:44,222
just as much as we cheer for
own team's victory.

971
00:58:44,288 --> 00:58:45,948
That's so twisted.

972
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:47,292
Sarah?

973
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:49,918
Okay, I'm a little high.

974
00:58:49,995 --> 00:58:51,615
Yo, this is like confession.

975
00:58:53,597 --> 00:58:55,827
I'm out of here.

976
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:57,160
No, wait.

977
00:58:59,603 --> 00:59:00,973
I have something to confess.

978
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:02,368
This should be good.

979
00:59:02,438 --> 00:59:04,198
Miss USA has a secret.

980
00:59:04,274 --> 00:59:06,744
Spill, Tara Connor.

981
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:08,370
I'm scared.

982
00:59:08,444 --> 00:59:09,844
It's okay, Carson.

983
00:59:09,914 --> 00:59:11,354
You can do it.

984
00:59:11,415 --> 00:59:13,905
No, that's it.

985
00:59:13,984 --> 00:59:15,354
I'm scared.

986
00:59:18,156 --> 00:59:19,446
You know, I act like the
fearless captain

987
00:59:19,523 --> 00:59:20,783
who's not afraid to go for it,

988
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:25,587
but, in reality,going for it
is my biggest fear.

989
00:59:25,663 --> 00:59:27,833
I'm so confused.

990
00:59:27,899 --> 00:59:30,299
But don't let it stop you, I mean,
it happens all the time.

991
00:59:30,367 --> 00:59:33,097
Yeah. What I meant was,

992
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:35,160
I just wish I could believe in myself

993
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:37,608
as much as I believe in all of you.

994
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:47,679
I'm not gay.

995
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:51,580
I like girls

996
00:59:51,654 --> 00:59:53,384
a lot.

997
00:59:53,457 --> 00:59:55,047
Are you serious?

998
00:59:56,359 --> 00:59:58,619
I'm straight.

999
00:59:58,696 --> 01:00:02,786
You girls just assumed,

1000
01:00:02,865 --> 01:00:07,455
so once you started changing in
front of me, I couldn't stop you.

1001
01:00:07,538 --> 01:00:11,028
And then, I was like committed.

1002
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:12,628
Hold up.

1003
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:16,079
There's no way this guy's not gay,
and I'll prove it.

1004
01:00:21,385 --> 01:00:22,815
Okay.

1005
01:00:22,886 --> 01:00:24,376
He is not gay.

1006
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,754
No, but he is dead.

1007
01:00:26,824 --> 01:00:28,494
Get him. Get him.

1008
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:36,630
Hey, Mom. Hey, can I speak to
the General?

1009
01:00:37,701 --> 01:00:39,071
All right.

1010
01:00:41,505 --> 01:00:43,055
Hello, sir.

1011
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:44,800
No, everything's fine.

1012
01:00:44,874 --> 01:00:46,644
I'm fine.

1013
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:48,200
No, I'm great.

1014
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:54,254
Actually, I'm not at Warrior
Camp exactly.

1015
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:55,978
I'm at Cheer Camp.

1016
01:00:58,422 --> 01:01:01,952
Because I'm a cheerleader.

1017
01:01:03,861 --> 01:01:05,521
Yes, one of those.

1018
01:01:09,033 --> 01:01:10,593
Sir?

1019
01:01:10,668 --> 01:01:12,138
Dad?

1020
01:01:12,201 --> 01:01:13,191
Dad!

1021
01:01:15,305 --> 01:01:16,895
Listen.

1022
01:01:16,974 --> 01:01:18,704
This is the funny thing,
when you hear the rest,

1023
01:01:18,776 --> 01:01:21,966
cheerleading is gonna sound
like the good part.

1024
01:01:23,646 --> 01:01:25,266
About West Point...

1025
01:01:26,383 --> 01:01:30,083
Okay, that was traumatic but good, right?

1026
01:01:30,154 --> 01:01:31,594
I mean, now we can work as a team.

1027
01:01:31,655 --> 01:01:34,015
Yeah. A team of freaks.

1028
01:01:34,091 --> 01:01:36,291
We are not a team, okay?

1029
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:39,820
We can't combine routines and
this was a dumbass idea!

1030
01:01:40,764 --> 01:01:43,164
Tell them, Ruben. We can do this.

1031
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:47,000
We blow. We cannot do this.

1032
01:01:47,104 --> 01:01:49,544
Because we're cursed, all of us.

1033
01:01:49,605 --> 01:01:52,575
Holy crap, Ruben, snap out of it!

1034
01:01:54,011 --> 01:01:56,451
What have you done with happy Ruben?

1035
01:01:56,513 --> 01:01:57,983
It's weird, you know.

1036
01:01:58,048 --> 01:02:00,178
Now that I'm not gay anymore,

1037
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:02,050
I'm not gay anymore.

1038
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:03,638
Okay, we're freaks!

1039
01:02:03,721 --> 01:02:05,191
But let's make that work for us.

1040
01:02:05,255 --> 01:02:07,515
Come on, you guys. I mean,
there has to be some way

1041
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:09,820
that we can perform together.

1042
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:13,945
We can start with couples.

1043
01:02:34,717 --> 01:02:35,977
I'll take the lead.

1044
01:02:36,053 --> 01:02:37,283
So, like, we're gonna copy them?

1045
01:02:37,354 --> 01:02:39,124
I'm gonna move to the right
then to the left.

1046
01:02:39,188 --> 01:02:40,618
Okay.

1047
01:02:40,691 --> 01:02:41,781
Start up like that, all right?

1048
01:02:41,859 --> 01:02:42,879
Okay.

1049
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,620
Here we go.

1050
01:02:44,695 --> 01:02:45,845
Hey, you want to try this?

1051
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:47,018
There you go.

1052
01:02:48,465 --> 01:02:49,795
Top again.

1053
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:55,400
All right, top again. Here we go.

1054
01:03:01,712 --> 01:03:04,442
Give me a turn. There you go.

1055
01:03:33,544 --> 01:03:34,814
For real.

1056
01:03:36,914 --> 01:03:38,384
This could work.

1057
01:03:38,448 --> 01:03:40,848
And I'll prove it. Get over here.

1058
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:45,882
All right, everybody ready?
From the top.

1059
01:03:45,956 --> 01:03:48,516
Look, I'm cool about you coming
out of the straight closet.

1060
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:50,791
Please, you're just saying that
so I'll try to catch you.

1061
01:03:50,861 --> 01:03:52,421
Try?

1062
01:03:52,496 --> 01:03:55,466
All right. Five, six, seven, eight.

1063
01:04:49,887 --> 01:04:51,857
That was tight. You know what?

1064
01:04:51,989 --> 01:04:53,959
I think we could actually win this.

1065
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:57,730
Maybe we should make sure.

1066
01:04:57,794 --> 01:05:02,034
"Compare the opposing army so
you may know where strength lies. "

1067
01:05:02,099 --> 01:05:03,259
Recon?

1068
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:11,602
Hey, guys. We need to get some disguises.

1069
01:05:18,682 --> 01:05:20,912
They practice on stage 70A. Find it.

1070
01:05:20,983 --> 01:05:23,013
Cell phones ready?

1071
01:05:23,086 --> 01:05:25,706
Recon positions by texting only. Break!

1072
01:05:41,571 --> 01:05:43,301
Chels,

1073
01:05:43,373 --> 01:05:45,243
I'm right next to you.

1074
01:06:01,858 --> 01:06:03,188
Thank you.

1075
01:06:11,768 --> 01:06:13,528
Hey, Ron, get the gate for me.

1076
01:06:15,405 --> 01:06:17,265
Hello, Mr. Voorhees.

1077
01:06:17,341 --> 01:06:19,171
The Flamingos just started...

1078
01:06:19,243 --> 01:06:21,213
Listen, we have got to tighten
up the security.

1079
01:06:21,278 --> 01:06:23,638
I need more time for my Flamingos...

1080
01:06:24,214 --> 01:06:26,014
Keep up the good work.

1081
01:06:28,652 --> 01:06:31,142
I guess your father would laugh
at us, huh?

1082
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:33,280
He's not big into laughter.

1083
01:06:33,357 --> 01:06:36,047
You know, I told him everything.

1084
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:37,245
Really?

1085
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:39,796
Then what'd he say about you
being a cheerleader?

1086
01:06:39,863 --> 01:06:41,893
Well, that he laughed at.

1087
01:06:44,501 --> 01:06:46,731
Hey, covert cheer-ops.

1088
01:06:47,371 --> 01:06:49,131
Two-to-one pyramid.

1089
01:06:52,074 --> 01:06:55,274
All right, Ruben, Eric, Nick,
you three in the corner, be the base.

1090
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:58,035
Come on, guys, hurry up. Let's go.

1091
01:06:58,114 --> 01:06:59,604
Chelsea, watch out for the guard.

1092
01:06:59,683 --> 01:07:02,553
Brooke, first level. All right.

1093
01:07:02,618 --> 01:07:04,448
One, two, three.

1094
01:07:05,989 --> 01:07:07,719
All right. Now, Carson.

1095
01:07:07,792 --> 01:07:09,422
One, two, three.

1096
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:20,240
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

1097
01:07:20,303 --> 01:07:22,533
I don't want to see any loose knees.

1098
01:07:22,606 --> 01:07:25,036
Jason, that's on the two.
You're always late.

1099
01:07:25,108 --> 01:07:26,868
Wait, how did you guys get in here?

1100
01:07:26,943 --> 01:07:30,813
Seriously, that guy wasn't
even a real guard.

1101
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,410
"If an enemy leaves the door open,
you must rush in. "

1102
01:07:33,483 --> 01:07:34,883
Art of War.

1103
01:07:36,085 --> 01:07:37,485
Base, keep it together now.

1104
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:40,963
I really want to see you attack
the ground. Oh, yeah!

1105
01:07:43,093 --> 01:07:44,753
Oh, my gosh.

1106
01:07:44,828 --> 01:07:46,628
Welcome to cheer-topia.

1107
01:07:46,696 --> 01:07:48,856
State of the art everything.

1108
01:07:50,067 --> 01:07:51,757
Is that Letty Trotter?

1109
01:07:51,834 --> 01:07:53,304
Choreographer to the stars?

1110
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:54,530
That look on your faces,

1111
01:07:54,604 --> 01:07:56,764
that's the same look I had after
my divorce.

1112
01:07:56,839 --> 01:07:59,139
So sad to see a dream die.

1113
01:08:00,544 --> 01:08:03,344
Anyhoo, give my best to Pepper,
would you?

1114
01:08:07,983 --> 01:08:10,383
Vance wasn't bluffing.

1115
01:08:10,454 --> 01:08:12,484
Their tumbling is amazing.

1116
01:08:12,557 --> 01:08:13,647
Those Flamingos are like...

1117
01:08:13,722 --> 01:08:15,282
Better than us.

1118
01:08:15,892 --> 01:08:17,622
We need to come up with something
really good.

1119
01:08:17,727 --> 01:08:18,747
No, really?

1120
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:20,418
I thought we'd come up with
something bad

1121
01:08:20,497 --> 01:08:22,057
and see if we can win that way.

1122
01:08:22,132 --> 01:08:25,292
Sorry, it's a reflex.

1123
01:08:25,367 --> 01:08:26,387
What are we going to do?

1124
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:28,270
Look, I don't know, okay?
I can't believe it.

1125
01:08:28,338 --> 01:08:31,968
After all this, I just wanted
to win Camp Championships once.

1126
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:33,371
Don't freak out, Carson.

1127
01:08:33,443 --> 01:08:36,113
Yeah, easy for you to say. You've won.

1128
01:08:39,649 --> 01:08:42,639
Look, our dance routine is
better than theirs.

1129
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:45,119
We just need a triple threat.

1130
01:08:45,188 --> 01:08:47,618
Let's think. What would Sun Tzu do?

1131
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:54,817
"Make use of concubines
who are greedy for gold. "

1132
01:09:04,341 --> 01:09:06,671
I don't think Sun Tzu would be
riding a rollercoaster, Carson.

1133
01:09:06,742 --> 01:09:08,712
You see how the red and blue rails loop?

1134
01:09:08,778 --> 01:09:10,538
Criss-cross and then corkscrew away?

1135
01:09:10,614 --> 01:09:12,604
Yeah, almost like a double helix.

1136
01:09:13,717 --> 01:09:15,547
That'll be the path of the two flyers.

1137
01:09:15,619 --> 01:09:16,609
Sweet! Sweet!

1138
01:09:16,687 --> 01:09:18,377
No one's ever done that before.

1139
01:09:18,455 --> 01:09:20,315
We're gonna need something new
if we want to win.

1140
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:22,650
Imagine if we pull it off.
That would be sick!

1141
01:09:22,759 --> 01:09:24,189
It'd be awesome. So cool!

1142
01:09:24,261 --> 01:09:26,531
But is it possible?

1143
01:09:26,596 --> 01:09:29,456
Yeah, it's gonna be really
difficult for the flyers.

1144
01:09:29,533 --> 01:09:31,193
Who's gonna do it?

1145
01:09:32,369 --> 01:09:33,929
Five, six, seven, eight...

1146
01:10:01,096 --> 01:10:02,256
You okay?

1147
01:10:02,332 --> 01:10:03,422
Yeah. I'm fine.

1148
01:10:03,499 --> 01:10:05,559
All right, you guys, let's do it again.

1149
01:10:19,516 --> 01:10:22,636
One, two, three, four, five, six...

1150
01:10:54,085 --> 01:10:56,415
Hey, Aeysha, who taught you to sew?

1151
01:10:56,486 --> 01:10:57,746
Martha Stewart.

1152
01:10:57,821 --> 01:11:00,411
All right. One portable hot press.

1153
01:11:00,489 --> 01:11:02,519
Nice work. Where'd you find that?

1154
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:06,552
Concierges can do anything all
over the world.

1155
01:11:06,629 --> 01:11:09,959
You'll see for yourself
when we win tomorrow.

1156
01:11:16,306 --> 01:11:18,496
Where in the world of competition sports

1157
01:11:18,574 --> 01:11:20,514
will you find two arch rivals,

1158
01:11:20,577 --> 01:11:22,737
forced by a dramatic twist of fate,

1159
01:11:22,812 --> 01:11:24,942
to join teams and combine their styles

1160
01:11:25,015 --> 01:11:27,105
to face a mysterious new challenger?

1161
01:11:27,182 --> 01:11:30,452
Well, right here at the All Star
Cheer Camp Championships,

1162
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:32,540
where one of these teams will
win the title

1163
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:34,522
and the right to represent
the United States

1164
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:36,460
in the World Cheer Exhibition Tour.

1165
01:11:36,527 --> 01:11:37,817
And who will that be?

1166
01:11:44,166 --> 01:11:49,096
Up next on Cheer TV, the most
exciting cheerleading in the world!

1167
01:11:49,171 --> 01:11:51,111
All right. All right. All right.
Ladies and gentlemen,

1168
01:11:51,173 --> 01:11:53,443
boys and girls, moms and dads,

1169
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:56,570
welcome to the All Star Cheer
Camp Championship!

1170
01:11:58,415 --> 01:11:59,775
You guys look great.

1171
01:11:59,848 --> 01:12:01,608
All right. Well, let's not
waste any more time.

1172
01:12:01,685 --> 01:12:04,705
Let's bring out our first people,
representing Camp Victory,

1173
01:12:04,789 --> 01:12:08,219
ladies and gentlemen, make a
lot of noise for Sebring!

1174
01:12:32,614 --> 01:12:35,854
PEPPER.. Thank you, Prairie Dogs.
Good luck in the competition.

1175
01:12:35,919 --> 01:12:39,379
Next up on the practice pad,
the Flamingos.

1176
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:52,128
...three, four, five, six,
seven, eight.

1177
01:13:03,847 --> 01:13:04,967
Yeah.

1178
01:13:17,227 --> 01:13:18,217
Yeah!

1179
01:13:18,328 --> 01:13:19,918
Yeah! Good job.

1180
01:13:20,864 --> 01:13:22,834
All right. All right!

1181
01:13:24,134 --> 01:13:25,934
Great job, Sebring!

1182
01:13:27,102 --> 01:13:28,632
They really brought it, didn't they?

1183
01:13:28,705 --> 01:13:32,365
Another fantastic routine. Am I right?

1184
01:13:33,143 --> 01:13:35,643
Yeah! Are you ready for another?

1185
01:13:36,112 --> 01:13:38,242
All right! All the way from
South Dakota,

1186
01:13:38,313 --> 01:13:40,413
give it up for the Prairie Dogs!

1187
01:13:40,483 --> 01:13:42,543
Don't forget your lock out.

1188
01:13:50,093 --> 01:13:52,823
All right, guys, let's run it.
Five, six...

1189
01:15:06,369 --> 01:15:08,299
This is a cheer-saster.

1190
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:10,300
A cheer-tastrophe.

1191
01:15:10,907 --> 01:15:13,567
A total cheer-clipse of the sun.

1192
01:15:13,644 --> 01:15:14,634
Not bad. Good one.

1193
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:15,730
Yes.

1194
01:15:15,812 --> 01:15:17,252
Look, no, you guys are all wrong, okay.

1195
01:15:17,313 --> 01:15:19,253
We're still good. We just...

1196
01:15:19,314 --> 01:15:21,224
We want the crowd to be pumped up.

1197
01:16:27,984 --> 01:16:31,224
MAN.. Okay, all right.
They were really good, right?

1198
01:16:32,221 --> 01:16:35,051
Sharks, Jets, Shets.

1199
01:16:35,123 --> 01:16:37,353
It doesn't really matter what
you call yourselves.

1200
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:41,226
Oh, and you call yourselves
the Flaming Hoes.

1201
01:16:41,297 --> 01:16:43,417
Yeah. That's a bad choice.

1202
01:16:43,499 --> 01:16:47,829
...introduce to you, the mighty
Flamingos.

1203
01:16:52,575 --> 01:16:55,935
Hope you've been practicing
your loser facials.

1204
01:16:56,012 --> 01:16:58,342
Oh, wait. I think you're on.

1205
01:16:58,681 --> 01:17:00,581
You are so on.

1206
01:17:00,683 --> 01:17:03,983
Shelby, come on!

1207
01:17:04,053 --> 01:17:05,153
Come on, you guys.

1208
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:06,250
Let's go.

1209
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:16,800
Flamingos, think pink!

1210
01:17:16,933 --> 01:17:18,423
Pink, pink, pink!

1211
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:54,331
They're even better than I
remembered.

1212
01:17:54,404 --> 01:17:56,534
And they're not even cursed.

1213
01:17:57,006 --> 01:17:58,366
Carson.

1214
01:18:12,488 --> 01:18:14,748
Okay, you've got to get over
yourself and fast.

1215
01:18:14,823 --> 01:18:16,493
What? Stop psyching yourself out.

1216
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:17,580
Look, I'm totally fine.

1217
01:18:17,660 --> 01:18:20,030
You're totally not, and they
know that you're scared.

1218
01:18:20,095 --> 01:18:21,495
Look, what else do you want me to say?

1219
01:18:21,565 --> 01:18:22,925
You've been right about me all along.

1220
01:18:22,998 --> 01:18:24,298
I'm not a good leader, my skills are...

1221
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:26,296
You idiot. This is not about skills.

1222
01:18:26,369 --> 01:18:28,269
This competition is about
showmanship.

1223
01:18:28,337 --> 01:18:31,197
Your choreography is going to
win it for us.

1224
01:18:31,274 --> 01:18:34,804
Don't you know you're more
creative than me?

1225
01:18:34,877 --> 01:18:37,607
Why else would I bother to put you down?

1226
01:18:38,081 --> 01:18:41,921
Carson, you've got it. You always have.

1227
01:18:42,886 --> 01:18:45,676
But for the Shets' sake,
now you gotta bring it.

1228
01:18:45,755 --> 01:18:48,375
Hey, it's your year, remember?

1229
01:18:48,458 --> 01:18:50,858
No, Brooke, it's our year.

1230
01:19:14,684 --> 01:19:15,984
All right, you guys, this is it.

1231
01:19:16,053 --> 01:19:17,283
Just stay tight and lock out.

1232
01:19:17,353 --> 01:19:18,883
Okay. On three.

1233
01:19:20,056 --> 01:19:21,346
One, two, three.

1234
01:19:21,425 --> 01:19:22,645
Shets!

1235
01:19:27,230 --> 01:19:29,490
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1236
01:19:30,099 --> 01:19:31,529
Yeah. Hey.

1237
01:19:36,606 --> 01:19:38,506
Yeah! Great job!

1238
01:19:40,042 --> 01:19:43,942
And now for our last performance
of the day,

1239
01:19:44,012 --> 01:19:49,582
from Camp Spirit Thunder,
rising from the ashes of both coasts,

1240
01:19:49,651 --> 01:19:52,491
here are the Shets!

1241
01:20:07,502 --> 01:20:10,032
Don't worry, skids, I checked
your marks.

1242
01:20:10,106 --> 01:20:11,596
Just catch me, okay.

1243
01:20:11,673 --> 01:20:12,803
Cradle.

1244
01:20:13,442 --> 01:20:14,932
All set, Penn.

1245
01:21:43,666 --> 01:21:44,786
Cradle.

1246
01:21:46,602 --> 01:21:48,502
Told you I'd catch you.

1247
01:23:59,734 --> 01:24:02,104
Yes, yes. Yes, yes!

1248
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:41,906
We did it!

1249
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:50,610
That's what I'm talking about.
Give me some.

1250
01:24:50,686 --> 01:24:52,306
Some what?

1251
01:24:52,387 --> 01:24:54,617
Okay. All right. Yeah!

1252
01:24:54,690 --> 01:24:58,850
As always, Cheer Camp Championships
deliver, huh? Let's hear you.

1253
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:00,897
We'll have to wait for the
judges to score

1254
01:25:00,964 --> 01:25:02,864
because this one's going to be close.

1255
01:25:04,032 --> 01:25:05,762
Too close. Yeah.

1256
01:25:05,835 --> 01:25:07,855
Now is a really bad time to be cursed.

1257
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:11,767
You know what? Who cares if we're cursed?

1258
01:25:11,841 --> 01:25:15,001
Getting cursed may have been the
best thing that's ever happened to us.

1259
01:25:15,076 --> 01:25:17,506
Without this curse, we would have
never become this team,

1260
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:19,510
and hit a stunt that's never
been done before.

1261
01:25:19,582 --> 01:25:21,572
I mean, that was amazing.

1262
01:25:22,118 --> 01:25:24,848
I have the results right here.

1263
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:27,620
I'll be reading third place, apparently.

1264
01:25:27,690 --> 01:25:31,520
In third place, representing
South Dakota, the Prairie Dogs.

1265
01:25:32,561 --> 01:25:34,191
Way to go, Dogs.

1266
01:25:35,296 --> 01:25:37,886
Look, we all gave 100%,
and we trust each other.

1267
01:25:37,967 --> 01:25:41,227
Who cares about some stupid old
trophy and world tour?

1268
01:25:41,302 --> 01:25:44,572
Coming in at second place,

1269
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:46,630
the Flamingos!

1270
01:25:47,910 --> 01:25:48,930
Oh, my God!

1271
01:25:49,011 --> 01:25:51,641
All right. So that means the
winning squad

1272
01:25:51,714 --> 01:25:53,774
that will represent the United States

1273
01:25:53,916 --> 01:25:56,006
on a Cheer Exhibition World Tour

1274
01:25:56,085 --> 01:25:59,645
is the East-West Shets!

1275
01:26:01,457 --> 01:26:03,047
Brooke, I meant what I said. I know.

1276
01:26:03,125 --> 01:26:04,745
It's just... We freaking won!

1277
01:26:04,827 --> 01:26:05,847
I know.

1278
01:26:07,096 --> 01:26:09,356
Pepper, got something for you.

1279
01:26:09,431 --> 01:26:11,131
My spirit stick.

1280
01:26:11,201 --> 01:26:12,831
Vance, I knew it was you all along.

1281
01:26:12,901 --> 01:26:14,891
But why? You don't even believe in it.

1282
01:26:14,970 --> 01:26:16,100
No, but you do.

1283
01:26:16,372 --> 01:26:18,642
Besides, the stupid stick didn't
work in the first place.

1284
01:26:18,707 --> 01:26:20,467
Pepper. Maybe it did.

1285
01:26:20,543 --> 01:26:22,273
We broke the curse.

1286
01:26:23,345 --> 01:26:25,745
You sure did. Congratulations.

1287
01:26:25,814 --> 01:26:32,014
No more curse! No more curse!

1288
01:26:32,087 --> 01:26:33,917
No more curse!

1289
01:26:34,589 --> 01:26:35,779
Carson.
