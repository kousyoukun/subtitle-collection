1
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,350
我知道你还没用完
I know you ain't done yet.

2
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,390
你说你把东西都用完了
You say you're all used up,

3
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,810
但我知道你还剩了些金子
but I know you still got some gold left in ya.

4
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,800
到底是什么…
What in tarnation...

5
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,620
你好啊 警长
Howdy, sheriff.

6
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,290
啊 我被你骗了
Uh-oh! You got me.

7
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,580
早
Morning.

8
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,380
爸爸
Daddy!

9
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,760
看看你 亲爱的 又亮又闪 像活的娃娃
Look at you, sweetheart! All bright and shiny, like a living doll.

10
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,090
转一转
Give us a twirl.

11
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,890
哇 这是婚纱吗 我可以偷看一下吗
Whoo! Is this the wedding dress? Can I have a sneak peek?

12
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,140
别捣蛋 爸 你会在我们的大喜日子里看个够
Don't be a cheat, daddy. You'll get a full preview on our big day.

13
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,220
就快了
Very soon now.

14
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,140
你至少能忍一忍吗
Can you at least try and make an effort?

15
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,520
安格斯 我看到你也回程了
Angus, I see you made the return trip as well.

16
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,150
婚礼一般是男女之间的事儿 费索警长
A wedding generally is between a woman and a man, sheriff pulsipher.

17
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,530
是的 我已经迫不及待地想要见到那个年轻人了
Yes it is, and I can't wait to meet that young man.

18
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,820
好了 爸爸
Okay, daddy.

19
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,450
听我说
Listen to me.

20
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,040
五天后 不管你喜不喜欢
In five days, Angus will be a part of this family

21
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,500
安格斯都会成为家人
whether you like it or not.

22
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,330
我想看到的是他够男人
What I'd like to see is he's man enough

23
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,210
来接替我保护你
to take over the reins in protecting you.

24
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,040
我的意思是 他是否擅长铁器
I mean, is he any good with a barking iron?

25
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,800
我想要老公 爸爸 而不是保镖
I want a husband, daddy. Not a bodyguard.

26
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,070
你教会了我如何照顾好自己
You've taught me how to take good enough care of myself.

27
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,840
他教我剖析陀思妥耶夫斯基的文字
He's taught me how to dissect the words of dostoyevsky

28
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,680
他还向我介绍了狄更斯和爱伦坡...
and he's introduced me to dickens and poe...

29
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,810
你都还没结婚呢 就开始和执法者见面了
You're not even married yet, and you're already meeting with lawyers?

30
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,180
爸爸 别这样
Daddy, stop it.

31
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:15,440
安格斯是个好人 他确实给了我安全和可靠
Angus is a good soul who does make me feel safe and secure,

32
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,270
但最重要的还是幸福
but most of all, happy.

33
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:20,650
你怕你不再是我生命中的头号男人了
You're just afraid you won't be the number one man in my life anymore.

34
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,580
你把他训练得很好 夏洛特 这一点是肯定的
You got him well-trained, Charlotte, that's for sure.

35
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,360
我这就来
I'm right here.

36
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:34,870
进去
Inside.

37
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,960
去抓他们 把他们围起来
Go get 'em, boys! Round them up!

38
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,380
是萨缪尔一家
It's the Samuels.

39
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,840
快点儿 女士们 我没有一整天的时间陪你们玩
Hurry it up, ladies. I ain't got all day.

40
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,640
除了我以外 任何人入门 你就开枪
Anybody other than me comes through those doors, you shoot 'em.

41
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:52,930
快走 快走
Move it, move it!

42
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,560
快走
Move it!

43
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,600
爸爸 安格斯
Daddy? Angus.

44
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,480
-他到底让你有多幸福 -爸爸 快走
- Homrhappydoes hereahyrnakeyou? - Daddy, go!

45
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,450
你现在可以出来了
You can come out now.

46
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,870
走 走
Go, go!

47
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,830
-快走 -走
- Move it! - Come on, let's go.

48
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,170
继续前进
Keep moving!

49
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,710
我第一次被悬赏了
First time I made it on a poster.

50
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,380
嘿 我很帅
Hey! I'm handsome!

51
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,470
举起手来
Hands up!

52
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,430
过来
Come here.

53
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,140
趴低 走
Stay down. Go!

54
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,500
没关系 此乃人之常情
Don't mind. Happens to everyone.

55
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,710
来这里是疯狂的旅程
It's a crazy ride getting here.

56
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,590
看到了没
See?

57
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,670
我刚看到了最...
I just saw the most...

58
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,130
最美 最亮的光 你见过吗 那是天堂
Beautiful, bright light you ever did see? That'd be heaven.

59
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,180
朝着天堂 是你未来的好迹象
Heading towards it is a good sign for your future.

60
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,800
但你还不能上天堂
But you haven't made it there yet.

61
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,430
等等
Hold on! Hold your damn horses.

62
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,890
你说的是天堂吗
Did you say heaven?

63
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,440
我读过你的档案 罗伊
I've read your file, Roy.

64
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,150
我知道关于你的一切
I know everything about you

65
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,910
没有人说你听力不好
and none of it says you're hard of hearing.

66
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,190
我死了吗
I'm dead?

67
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,150
夏洛特 我女儿夏洛特怎样了
Charlotte? What about my daughter, Charlotte?

68
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,030
呃 嗯… 没有
Uh, hmm... negative.

69
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:17,700
她死了 她死了
She's dead. She's dead.

70
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,620
不 不 没有就是没死
No, no. Negative is positive.

71
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,160
没有意思是“没死”
Negative means "not dead."

72
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,540
没有意思是“没死”
Negative means "not dead"?

73
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,920
非常令人困惑 改改吧
That is very confusing. Change that.

74
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,800
但很好
Butgood.

75
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,170
她的婚礼在这周末
She's got her wedding at the end of the week.

76
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,630
其实是在两天后
It's in two days, actually.

77
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,800
再说一遍
Come again?

78
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,680
你死了三天了
You've been dead for three days.

79
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,010
天上需要时间来批准
It takes a while for upstairs to ratifyjudgement

80
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,810
并把灵魂送到它所属的地方
and send a soul to where it belongs.

81
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,140
你被送到了我们这里
You got sent to us.

82
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,440
欢迎来到冥界警局
Welcome to the ripd.

83
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,690
“冥界”什么
The "rip..." What?

84
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,570
“D”代表“局”
"'D.' stands for "department."

85
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,860
“冥界”代表“安息”
The "rip" is your standard "rest in peace."

86
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,530
我是美国西部分局的队长
I'm the captain of the west American division.

87
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:55,910
名字叫哈诺
Name's hano.

88
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:59,580
我们一般只收死掉的士兵
See, we generally only get soldiers, warriors and sheriffs

89
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,580
还有战士和警长
who dearly depart shuffled in here to us.

90
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,540
还有那些有资格加入天国警察的人
At least the ones deemed worthy enough

91
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:07,170
以继续与死人斗争
to serve on god's own police force in the ongoing fight against the deados.

92
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,380
死什么
The what-os?

93
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,670
死人
The deados.

94
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,840
那些逃脱审判的灵魂 在地球上游荡
Souls that escape theirjudgment and hang around earth

95
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,010
就像他们身上的臭味
like the bad smell they are.

96
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,760
我们的工作是找到他们
Our job is to find them

97
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,270
并把他们送到他们该去的地方
and send them to where their ticket got punched.

98
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,890
就是地狱 罗伊 我们把他们送到地狱
Hell, Roy. We send them to hell.

99
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,350
天堂和地狱
Heaven and hell?

100
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,090
所以这些在地狱里逃脱审判的灵魂
So these souls that escape their judgement in hell

101
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,900
就是你们所说的“死人”
are what you call "deados."

102
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,280
还不是 灵魂 根据定义
Not yet. A soul, by its very definition,

103
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,740
是一种幽灵能量
is a spectral energy.

104
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,580
没有实体
Disembodied, it's ineffectual.

105
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,710
为了传播恶灵所希望的灾难 它需要身体
To sow the havoc a rogue soul desires it needs a body.

106
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,790
等等 人类的身体吗
Wait. A human body?

107
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,080
是的
Exactly.

108
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,170
一旦它占据了人体并附体 如果你认为可以
And once it takes one over, possesses it, if you will,

109
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,920
那它就成了问题
then it becomes a problem.

110
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,430
是我们的问题 它就变成了死人
Our problem. It becomes a deado.

111
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,740
地球上死人越多 自然秩序就越不平衡
The more deados on earth, the more unbalanced the natural order,

112
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,840
会威胁所有人类的生命
threatening all human life.

113
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,640
我想你真的会喜欢这个
I think you're really gonna like this.

114
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,150
呜
Whoo-wee.

115
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,770
好一家糖果店
It's quite an impressive candy store you got here.

116
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,240
噢 你好
Oh, hello.

117
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,070
你真漂亮
Ain't you purdy.

118
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,330
很好的选择
That's a very nice choice.

119
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:27,830
哦… 不 不 不 我不能不忠
Oh... no, no, no. I can't be unfaithful.

120
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,500
说到武器 我只爱一把枪
When it comes to what I wear on my hip, I'm a one-gun man.

121
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,090
在我和我的苏茜之间没有任何东西
Nothing comes between me and my susie.

122
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,960
那就是我的枪
That's my gun.

123
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,590
我把她叫做苏西
I call her susie.

124
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,680
她是无效的
I call her useless.

125
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,890
特别是对付死人
Especially against deados.

126
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:45,850
它能让他们眩晕一两下 有点像讨厌的蛇咬
It'll stun them for a moment or two, kind of like a nasty snake bite.

127
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,190
然而 这把更赞
This, however, more than does the job.

128
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:52,360
只要头部中弹 这些子弹就能灭掉死人的灵魂
With a head shot, these bullets can exterminate a deado's soul.

129
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,860
还有你自己
And your own,

130
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,820
如果枪管最终指向了你
should the barrel end up being pointed in your direction.

131
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,990
哇 很高兴知道
Whoa. Good to know.

132
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,200
这条饿蛇 是怎么回事儿
What's with the, uh, hungry snake?

133
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,620
乌洛波洛斯标志着生命 死亡和重生
The uroboros signifies life, death and rebirth.

134
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,870
死人可能像真正的人类 但在被附体后
Deados may look like real humans, but after possession,

135
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,210
这个符号会被烙印在他们的躯干上
that symbol is branded on their torso.

136
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,840
这是对所有官员的提醒
This is a reminder to all officers

137
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,970
提醒他们要面对持续的威胁
of the constant threat we're up against.

138
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,970
说正题 我为什么在这里
Right. Cut to the chase. Why am I here?

139
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:23,260
罗伊 你还记得一个月前的日全食吗
Roy, do you remember that total eclipse about a month ago?

140
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,060
在红溪镇附近的门户处出现了异常裂缝
Well, there was an abnormal rupture at a gateway near red creek,

141
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,930
那个犹他州的老采矿镇
an old mining town in Utah.

142
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,020
说它“异常”是因为它对我们
"Abnormal," because it registered with us as a kind of

143
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,690
是地狱般的放电
hellish discharge.

144
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,190
我认识一个老庸医
I know an old quack back at home

145
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:38,650
他有治疗“地狱般的放电”的药方 如果你懂我意思
who has a remedy for "hellish discharges," if you know what I mean.

146
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,490
我注意到了 但不是我们要找的东西
Duly noted, but not what we're looking for.

147
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:43,780
不过 你比大多数人都更了解
You, however, know that terrain better than most.

148
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,740
只要你签字 我们会让你马上
You sign up, we'll get you back to earth right away

149
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,330
回到地球
to check it all out.

150
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,250
拜托 这可是很有价值的胡萝卜大诱饵
Now, that's a carrot worth the dangle.

151
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:54,080
如果我有机会回地球 请算我一份
If I get to go back to earth, sign me up and count me in!

152
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,590
我知道你的脑袋里在想什么 罗伊
I know what's going on in that noggin of yours, Roy.

153
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,300
每个处于同样位置的人 都有同样的想法
Everyone in your position thinks the same thing.

154
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,760
但为你的谋杀报仇 并不是我们的任务
But revenge for your murder is not the mission.

155
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,550
去红溪镇才是
Getting to red creek is.

156
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,600
让睡狗躺着吧
Let sleeping dogs lie.

157
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,600
你是死人 我们做什么都无法改变
You're a dead man. Nothing we can do can change that.

158
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,930
现在 在你阅读签字之前
Now, before you read and sign,

159
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,770
你必须知道标准服务条款...
you should know the standard service term...

160
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:14,190
我已经说了 算我一份 签协议吧
I already said I'm in. Let's seal the deal.

161
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,110
把我送回去
Send me back.

162
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:34,040
你给我打的烙印 整得我像头牛一样
You branded me like a damn steer.

163
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:38,050
现在晕了吧 牛仔 是时候行动了
Now giddy up, cowboy. It's time to move.

164
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:40,050
噢 注意我的面包脑袋
Oh! Watch the bread box.

165
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:41,970
对不起 随着时间的推移 人们长高了
Sorry. People got taller over time.

166
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:44,970
我们想换掉它 但你知道 预算有限
We'd like to replace it but, you know, budgetary constraints.

167
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,470
时间在流逝 罗伊
The clock's ticking, Roy.

168
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,520
两天后 血月将升起
In two days, a blood moon will rise.

169
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,230
在《圣经》中 当血月出现在蓝月食之后时
And in the Bible, when that follows a blue moon eclipse,

170
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,900
只能意味着一件事儿
it can only mean one thing.

171
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,150
天文学家的热闹时刻吗
A hoot of a time for astronomers?

172
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,730
是时代的结束
The end of times.

173
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,760
搞什么...
What the...

174
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,810
好极了
Oh, fancy.

175
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,230
这就是死亡的好处
That's the good thing about dying.

176
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,150
只能发生一次
It can only happen once.

177
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,070
你一定是费索警长
You must be sheriff pulsipher.

178
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,440
我的荣幸
In all my glory.

179
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,360
我见过荣幸 但我不觉得你是之一
I have seen glory and I don't think you are it.

180
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,870
你会是谁呢
Just who might you be?

181
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:31,990
贞德
Jeanne.

182
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,120
我叫贞德
The name is Jeanne.

183
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,830
听着 贞 我不搭档
Listen, Jane, I don't do partners.

184
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:39,370
哈诺要我照顾你 而我不会违背命令
Hano charged me with looking after you, and I don't go against orders.

185
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,670
我不需要别人的照顾
I don't need no looking after.

186
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,250
我也不需要第四个搭档
And I don't need a fourth partner.

187
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,940
四个搭档 你的另外三个搭档在哪儿
Four partners? Where are your other three?

188
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:48,260
无处不在 圣父 圣子和圣灵
Everywhere. The father, son and the holy ghost.

189
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,260
是啊 那三个枪手
Yeah, those three gun slingers?

190
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,430
当你需要火力支援的时候 他们并没有真正派上用场
They don't come in real handy when you need backup in fire fight.

191
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,770
我不需要枪的支援 因为我用剑是不可战胜的
I don't need backup with a gun when I'm unbeatable with a sword.

192
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,110
让我们弄清楚一件事儿
Let's make one thing clear.

193
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,860
安排我来这里 因为我有资历
I got seniority in this here arrangement.

194
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,780
我至少比你多20年
I got at least 20 years on ya.

195
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,030
如果我们还活着的话
If we were alive.

196
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,610
但你死了三天了
But you have been dead for three days.

197
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,870
162425天
162,425.

198
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,580
也就是445年
Or 445 years.

199
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,040
你现在觉得自己有多老
How senior do you feel now?

200
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,170
见鬼去吧 咿呀
Hell with this. Hee-ya!

201
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,430
我不会再问你了
Iain't gonna ask you again.

202
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,220
我说了 排好队
I said, get in line.

203
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,890
来吧 爸爸
Come on now, daddy.

204
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,640
没有必要伤害我 我是说 我们
No need to hurt me. I mean, us.

205
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,980
我会把保险箱里的东西都拿给你们
I'll get you all what I have in the safe.

206
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,940
我们不是来拿钱的
We ain't here for your money.

207
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,650
这是银行 你还想要什么
This is a bank. What else do you want?

208
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:46,820
他们
Them.

209
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,780
我们要人 你的保险箱里有他们吗
Yeah, we want people. You got any of them in your safe?

210
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,530
因为 我们会把他们全部带走
'Cause, we'll take 'em all. Oh!

211
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:56,410
对此我很抱歉
I'm sorry about that.

212
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,600
你这个最可悲的王八蛋 我们不幸地
You're the sorriest son-of-a-bitch we ever had the misfortune

213
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,410
-被困住了 -执法官来了
- of getting stuck with. - The law is coming.

214
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,080
该死 他们这次带来了整个骑兵队
God damn, they brought the whole cavalry this time.

215
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,380
你们三个留在这里 拖住他们
You three stay here. Hold them off.

216
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,130
-稍后再来找我们 -明白了
- Catch back up with us later. - Got it.

217
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,010
该死
Damn it!

218
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,850
你不需要搭档
You don't need a partner,

219
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,750
而我也不需要流浪狗 罗伊
and I don't need a stray dog, Roy.

220
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,540
现在走
Now let's go.

221
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,550
你不能阻止我去见我女儿
You're not gonna stop me from seeing my daughter.

222
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,590
现在 听着
Now, listen.

223
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,090
这是意外
That was unexpected.

224
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,390
你知道的 我从没打过女人
You know, I've never hit a woman.

225
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:40,270
但如果你介入我和夏洛特之间 那就会有麻烦了
But you come between me and my Charlotte, there's gonna be hell to pay.

226
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,230
比你活着的时候更快
Faster than when you were alive, huh?

227
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,890
我不能让你去见她
I can't let you go see her.

228
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,100
为什么不能
Why not?

229
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,560
因为你...
Because you...

230
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,650
不再是原来的你了
Aren't you anymore.

231
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,640
所以这是我的真实模样
So this is me now?

232
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,890
对地球上的每个人 无所谓
To everyone on earth, anyway.

233
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,530
你总是说我需要更多接触我女性的一面 米莉
You always said I needed to be more in touch with my feminine side, Millie.

234
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,200
如果你能看到现在的我就好了
If you could only see me now.

235
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,660
我心碎了 我女儿再也不会认识我了
Breaks my heart, my daughter will never know me again.

236
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,920
冥界警局给了你第二次机会来恢复世界的秩序
The ripd gave you a second chance to restore order to the world.

237
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,710
而不是你以前的生活
Not your old life.

238
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:37,260
所以我们不以自己的身份回来
That's why we don't return as ourselves.

239
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,880
这对认识我们的人来说太令人困惑了
It would be too confusing for anyone who knew us.

240
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,010
这里是1876年的美国
This is 1876 america.

241
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:43,900
如果你没有注意到 这些地方的人们
If you haven't noticed, folks around these parts

242
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,390
心胸并不宽广
ain't too broad-minded.

243
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:48,350
很少有人会跟我们交谈 更不用说听我们说话了
Few people are gonna talk to us, let alone even listen to us,

244
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,980
看着我们的样子
looking the way we do.

245
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,520
为什么这样做 让我们的工作更难
Why do that? Make ourjob that much harder?

246
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,070
也许永恒者认为 你可以学到一两样东西
Maybe the eternal one thought you could learn a thing or two.

247
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:58,360
替那些处境不利的人设身处地的考虑
Walking in shoes of those deemed less advantaged.

248
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,450
拜托 现在 我学到了很多
Come on, now. I have learned plenty.

249
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:01,990
我最好的朋友是黑人
My best friend is black.

250
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,370
而我女儿是女人
And my daughter is a woman.

251
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,080
仅仅因为你认识他们
Just because you know them,

252
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,040
并不意味着你了解他们自己的感受
does not mean you understand what it's like to be them.

253
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,830
我们会说我们是姐妹
We'll say we're sisters.

254
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,130
赏金猎人
Bounty hunters.

255
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,590
能让我们得到一些尊重
That should get us some respect.

256
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,260
我不敢相信 尸体就在那里
I can't believe that this here body

257
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:25,390
埋在我脚下
is right there, buried, under my feet.

258
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,470
这个嘛…
Well...

259
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:28,890
你想说啥
Well what?

260
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:32,140
你的一部分确实被埋在那里了
It's true that part of you was buried under there.

261
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,230
我的一部分
Part of me?

262
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,900
他们能找到的部分 在你中枪之后
The parts they could find. After you were shot.

263
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,940
我想这里埋藏的是一只脚 一个肩膀
I think buried here is a foot, a shoulder,

264
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,740
你的耳朵 也许 还有你的...
your ear, maybe, and your...

265
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,410
-我的屁股 -是的
- My ass? - Yes.

266
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,280
他们也找到了你的屁股
They found your ass, too.

267
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:48,450
我其他的部分在哪儿
Where is the rest of me?

268
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,700
很显然是在山洞里
In a cave, apparently.

269
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:52,580
-土狼找上了你 罗伊 -土狼吗
- Some coyotes got to you, Roy. - Some coyotes?

270
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,960
-它们很饿 而你死了 -饥饿的土狼
- They were hungry, and you were dead. - Hungry coyotes.

271
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,630
我听说它们有小狼宝
I heard they had some small babies.

272
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,590
小的 饥饿的 土狼宝宝
Small, hungry, baby coyotes.

273
00:20:58,670 --> 00:20:59,800
所以 你帮它们活下来了
So, you helped them survive.

274
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,170
干的漂亮
It's a beautiful thing,

275
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,010
-成为食物链的一部分 -闭嘴
- to be a part of the food chain. - Shut up.

276
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,530
-生命的循环... -别说了
- Circle of life... - Stop. Stop talking.

277
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:10,390
-你要去哪儿 罗伊 -我的肤色可能改变了
- Where are you going, Roy? - My skin might have changed,

278
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,070
但我的心和灵魂依然如故
but my heart and soul are still the same.

279
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,140
我知道我可以让我女儿认出我
I know I can make my daughter recognize me.

280
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,940
你也不能再与所爱的人交流了
You can't communicate with loved ones anymore either.

281
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:19,110
你对她说的任何话
Anything you say to her

282
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,780
都只是语无伦次的胡言乱语
will only come out as an incoherent gibberish.

283
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:27,530
所以 我女儿不仅认不出我
So, not only will my daughter not recognize me,

284
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,240
她也听不懂我在说什么
she won't understand a lick of what I'm saying, either?

285
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,080
简直是扯淡
This is some bullshit.

286
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,630
我完全理解你的感受 女士
I know exactly how you feel, ma'am.

287
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,920
我理解你的痛苦
I understand your pain.

288
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,880
把一切都发泄出来是件好事儿
It's good to let it all out.

289
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,850
你也是来向已故警长表示敬意的吧
You've come to pay your respects to the late sheriff, too, then?

290
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:52,930
我不能说我以前见过你们
I can't say I've seen you ladies around these parts before.

291
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,480
-你认识这个人吗 -那是亨利
- Do you know this man? - That is Henry.

292
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,940
我说过的 我的朋友
My friend I was talking about.

293
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,860
我们从膝盖高的时候就认识了
We've known each other since we were knee-high.

294
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,690
我叫玛蒂尔德 神父
Name's matilde, father.

295
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:08,160
这位是我的哑巴妹妹 梅布尔
And this here is my mute sister, Mabel.

296
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,910
我们只见过治安官一次
We only met the sheriff once.

297
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:15,120
他帮我们解决了坏掉的马车
He, uh, helped us with our broken down wagon.

298
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:19,670
我必须承认 我对他没有什么好感
I must admit, I didn't take much of a shine to him,

299
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,210
他也不喜欢我
nor him to me.

300
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:25,220
事实上 如果你问我 他似乎很自我陶醉
In fact, he seemed quite self-absorbed, if you ask me.

301
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:30,600
他是那种想控制自己任何情况的人
The kind of man that wanted to control every situation he was in

302
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,520
不管他是多么的不自量力
no matter how out of his depth he truly was.

303
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,730
但梅布尔
But Mabel, well,

304
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:41,270
她似乎觉得他真的很特别
she seemed to think he was something really special.

305
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,940
我想我们都有权提出自己的观点
Well, we're all entitled to our own points of view, I guess.

306
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:49,160
但在这一点上 我可能不得不支持梅布尔小姐
But I may have to side with miss Mabel over here on this one.

307
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,660
那个人很特别
That man was special.

308
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,330
当然 远非完美
Far from perfect, of course.

309
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,750
但还是很特别
But, special nonetheless.

310
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:59,750
我是说 他是不是有点傲慢
I mean, was he a little arrogant?

311
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,080
毫无疑问
No doubt.

312
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:04,710
他是否觉得在问题提出之前
Did he think that he had the answers

313
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,880
他就有了答案
before the questions were even asked?

314
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:10,090
那就是罗伊 如假包换
That was Roy, to a tee.

315
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,510
猪头 哈
Pigheaded? Ha!

316
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,060
顽固得像一头暴躁的骡子 更像是这样
Stubborn as an ornery mule, more like it.

317
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,690
孩子 罗伊很忠诚
Boy, was Roy loyal.

318
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:24,610
对他的家人 对这个镇子 对我
To his family, this town, to me.

319
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,950
没人比你更希望有你的支持
There is no one you wanted more to have your back.

320
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,910
我想知道没有他我们将如何站稳
Makes me wonder how we're gonna stand on our own two feet without him.

321
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,250
特别是面对邪恶的萨缪尔家族 他们把罗伊害惨了
Especially against the evil likes of them Samuels that did Roy in

322
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:39,580
并带走了夏洛特的未婚夫
and took poor Charlotte's fiance,

323
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,790
还有其他人
amongst others.

324
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:44,210
至少他们今天抓到了五个罪犯之中的三个
Least they caught three of them five reprobates

325
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,840
他们正在抢劫银行
holding up a bank today.

326
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:49,090
联邦法警将把他们转移到拉莱米
Federal marshals will be transferring them to laramie.

327
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,140
现在轮到他们上绞刑架了
It's the hangman's noose for them boys now.

328
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,850
-不 不 -他们正在把他们转移到拉莱米
- No, no. - They are moving them to laramie.

329
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:57,610
他们必须通过蛇谷 我们将在那里袭击他们
They gotta pass through snake gully and that's where we'll hit them.

330
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:01,600
我已经纵容了你小小的身份危机
I have indulged your little identity crisis.

331
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,610
但我们必须到红溪镇去
But we must get to red creek.

332
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:05,190
你没听到亨利的话吗
Didn't you hear Henry?

333
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,230
萨缪尔家庭带走了安格斯
The Samuels took Angus.

334
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,650
而这是地球当局要解决的问题
And that is an issue for the earthly authorities to solve,

335
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,950
不是我们
not us.

336
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,990
门户 传送门 死人
Gateways, portals, deados.

337
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:16,530
那才是你的管辖范围 警官
That is yourjurisdiction now, officer.

338
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,790
别挡我路
Out of my way.

339
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:22,040
世界可能处于危险之中 而你只关心救一个人
The world could be at stake and you care only about saving one man.

340
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,330
不是随便什么人
Not just any man.

341
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:27,960
是那个让我女儿成为世界上最幸福的人
The man that makes my daughter the happiest in the world.

342
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,800
而对我来说 我女儿就是我的世界
And for me, my daughter is my world.

343
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,130
是你曾经的世界
Was your world.

344
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,590
你已经死了
You are dead.

345
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,300
你会习惯于使用过去式的
You'll get used to using the past tense.

346
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,890
嘿 贞妮 你能去我的坟墓上走走吗
Hey, Jenny, would you go walk around on my grave?

347
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:39,350
很乐意
With pleasure.

348
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,480
等等 为什么
Wait, why?

349
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,250
因为如果你要成为我的肉中刺
'Cause ifyou're gonna be such a pain in my ass,

350
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,900
你还不如站在上面呢
you might as well be standing on it!

351
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,480
再见 梅布尔
Goodbye, Mabel.

352
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,230
现在好好照顾自己
Take good care now.

353
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,320
好的 梅布尔
Right. Mabel.

354
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,910
去后面
Settle down back there, boys.

355
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:03,500
稳住
Settle down.

356
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,840
顽固得像一头暴躁的骡子
Stubborn as an ornery mule.

357
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,220
如果不是我多年来
Well, if that isn't the understatement

358
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,850
对后世服务的轻描淡写
of my many years of after-life service.

359
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,970
你觉得 我对萨缪尔兄弟的处置相比
How you feel about me is nothing

360
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,140
简直是小巫见大巫
compared to my disposition for those Samuel brothers.

361
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:26,230
最糟糕的事情是 不久前
The damndest thing, not too long ago,

362
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,820
那些年轻人还很好 很敬畏上帝
those boys were good and god-fearing.

363
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,900
然后就像那样...
Then just like that...

364
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,490
坏了 转变了 烂到了极点
Bad. Turned. Rotten to the core.

365
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:34,110
老多丽丝·萨缪尔说
Old Doris Samuel said

366
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,860
她的四个儿子和养子史莱姆
her four boys and adopted son, slim,

367
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:39,950
有一天去他们农场的一口老井里干活
went out to work an old well one day on their farm,

368
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:42,410
那晚回来后成了一群疯狂的坏蛋
and came back that night a crazy bunch of no-goods.

369
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,370
她总是说 他们不再是她的孩子了
She always said it was like, they weren't her boys no more.

370
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:49,500
另外 亨利说五个萨缪尔有三个被抓了
Also, Henry said three of the five Samuels were caught.

371
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,340
本来应该只剩下四个
There should have been only four left.

372
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,970
我在被杀之前 我瞄准了他们的首领齐克
I pegged their leader, Zeke, before I was killed.

373
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,180
没人可以在那一枪中幸存下来
Nobody could have survived that shot.

374
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,760
也许你并不是你想象中的神枪手 安妮·奥克利
Maybe you're not the sharp shot you thought you were, Annie oakley.

375
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:05,310
我可以在50英尺外射掉大黄蜂的刺
I can shoot the sting off a hornet from 50 feet.

376
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:09,190
你的谦逊是一种美德 值得欣赏
Your humility is a virtue to behold.

377
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,480
谢谢
Thank you.

378
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,110
他们来了
Here they come.

379
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:17,030
告诉过你他们会经过这里
Told you they'd pass this way.

380
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,200
快点儿
Make it quick.

381
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:19,660
现在是我们的机会
Now's our chance.

382
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,420
不用担心 各位
Don't you worry none, fellas.

383
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,750
很快就会把你们送到法官那里
We'll be getting you to that judge soon enough.

384
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:34,510
光是你们在本区的表现 就能让你们在周日前喝一壶的
Just your exploits in this region alone will see you swinging by Sunday.

385
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,890
确定你不想去吗
Sure you don't wanna go?

386
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,640
这是好地方
It's a great spot.

387
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,560
我感觉轻如鸿毛
I feel light as a feather.

388
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:53,360
你在做什么 我们有惊喜
What are you doing? We got the element of surprise!

389
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,440
看
Look.

390
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,280
真他妈的
Holy shit!

391
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,360
乌洛波洛斯
The uroboros!

392
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,130
你的枪法也许并不差 罗伊
You may not be such a bad shot after all, Roy.

393
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,490
但你不可能杀死那个已经死了的东西
But you couldn't have killed that which was already dead.

394
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:05,950
多丽丝·萨缪尔觉得她的儿子们那晚没有回家 因为他们没有回家
Doris Samuels didn't think her sons came home that night because they didn't.

395
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:09,830
逃避审判的恶灵一定躲在那口井里
Rogue souls that escaped judgement must have been hiding in that well.

396
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,960
并附在兄弟俩身上 使他们成为死人
And possessed the brothers and made them deados.

397
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,760
而这恰恰属于我们的管辖范围
And this just became ourjurisdiction.

398
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,130
救命啊 帮帮我 先生们
Help! Help me, misters!

399
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,550
求你了
Please.

400
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,850
我妹妹
It's my sister!

401
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:26,350
她伤得很重
She's hurt real bad.

402
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,480
她有点慢 你看
She's a bit slow, you see,

403
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,480
而且没有敏锐的方向感
and doesn't have a keen sense of direction.

404
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,860
事实上 她现在对任何事情都没有敏锐的感觉
Fact, she don't much have a keen sense of anything at all right now,

405
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,940
说实话
truth be told.

406
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,440
她从峡谷顶滑下来
She slipped from the top of the canyon.

407
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:40,700
把自己摔得很惨
Banged herself up real good.

408
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,090
现在 你站住
Now, you hold it right there.

409
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:44,370
我们没有时间也没有能力
We do not have the time nor the disposition

410
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:45,950
去帮你这样的人
to help the likes of you.

411
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,410
我猜你也没有心情
Guess you don't have the disposition

412
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,420
来拿摩根的银子
for no Morgan silver then neither.

413
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,840
嘿 各位
Hey, fellas.

414
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,960
看看能不能帮助这位小女士
See if you can help the little lady out.

415
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,010
好吧 那么
Okay, then.

416
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,560
谢谢你
Thank you.

417
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,560
你们是真正的圣人
You're real saints.

418
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,500
嘿 各位 我们得走了
Hey fellas, we gotta go.

419
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,420
如果有必要 就让他们去死吧
Leave 'em to die if you have to.

420
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,390
确保能拿到银子
Just make sure you grab the silver.

421
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,510
各位
Fehas?

422
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,110
走 走 快走
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

423
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,840
哇 我打中她了
Whoa! I got her! I got her!

424
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,170
你去检查一下
You go check!

425
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:30,260
没错 你打中她了
Yeah, you got her.

426
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,270
绝对的
That's for damn sure.

427
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:38,480
但我看不到任何弹孔
But I can't see no bullet hole.

428
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,400
嘭
Boo!

429
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,070
嘿 警长
Hey, marshal.

430
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,280
还想要那个银子吗
Still want that silver?

431
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,240
死亡的事情 只能发生一次
That's the thing about dying, it can only happen once.

432
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:52,620
嗷 就像被蛇咬了一口
Ow. Just like a snake bite.

433
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:00,000
该死的锁这么坚固
Damn strong lock.

434
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:07,220
再搜搜他
Search him again!

435
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,430
我告诉你 钥匙一定是丢了
I'm telling you, the key must have got lost

436
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:12,890
当你忙着攻击我们联邦法警的时候
while you were busy assaulting us us federal marshals.

437
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:18,270
不 这些不是我的 哦 天哪
No! These ain't mine! Oh, god!

438
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,190
那现在怎么办
So what now?

439
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,490
我们必须啪掉一个
We're gonna have to pop one of them.

440
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,410
怎么啪
Pop what now?

441
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:33,290
你要和我们的俘虏一起喝私酒吗
You gonna partake in a little moonshine with our captives?

442
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:34,870
这不是私酒
This isn't moonshine.

443
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:38,500
但对于死人来说 是更折磨人的东西
But for deados, something far more torturous.

444
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,080
一旦啪了 他就必须停止
Once popped, he's got to be stopped.

445
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,010
搞什么...
What the...

446
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,980
天哪
Holy shit.

447
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,190
不 圣水
No, water.

448
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,900
全能的上帝保佑
Blessed by the almighty.

449
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:46,820
一旦他们附体人类 死人讨厌暴露他们真正的自我
Once they've possessed a human, deados hate revealing their true selves.

450
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,820
这种痛苦是无法忍受的
The pain is unbearable.

451
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,360
圣水加速了这一过程
Holy water speeds up the process.

452
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:53,870
另外两个在哪儿
Uh, where are the other two?

453
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,990
噢 来了一个
Oh, there's one.

454
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:00,540
就像我说的
Like I said,

455
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:03,130
在枪战中 我只需要剑
in a gunfight, all I need is my sword.

456
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,290
走吧 死人渣
Let's go, deado filth.

457
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,480
混蛋...
Son of a...

458
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,890
什么
What?

459
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:24,860
-什么 -你不要“什么什么”我 小子
- What? - Don't you "what, what" me, boy.

460
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,270
是你把我送进了骨头果园
You was the one that sent me to the bone orchard

461
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,150
在我后脑勺上开了一枪 你这该死的懦夫
with a slug to the back of the skull, ya damn coward!

462
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,530
女士 我不知道你是谁
Ma'am! I've no idea who you are!

463
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,570
他不认识你 罗伊塞弗斯
He doesn't recognize you, roycephus.

464
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:37,220
罗伊塞弗斯 她是罗伊塞弗斯
Roycephus? Her name is roycephus?

465
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,370
嗷
Oh!

466
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:39,950
我在你的墓碑上看到了
I saw it on your tombstone.

467
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,910
很有趣的名字 是罗马语吗
It is a pretty funny name. Is it Roman?

468
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,790
意思是高贵和善良
It means noble and kind!

469
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,920
我现在对这两者都没有感觉
Neither of which I'm feeling at the moment,

470
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,170
因为我盯着杀了我的凶手的眼睛
as I stare into the eyes of my murderer.

471
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,460
不 不 等一下
No! Whoa, whoa. Slow down!

472
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:53,340
现在我才知道费索警长在那天的火车附近被枪杀了
Now I know sheriff pulsipher was shot near the train that day,

473
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,720
但我不知道是谁干的
but I've no idea who did it.

474
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,850
是你干的
You did it!

475
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:58,510
是你 你从火车里向我开枪
It was you! You shot me from inside the train!

476
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,680
不 那张纸是一派胡言
Nah, that bill is a load of bosh.

477
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:01,930
有人想陷害我
Someone's trying to frame me!

478
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,350
好吧
Okay.

479
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,360
很好 很好 很明显 你看不到我们的真身
Cool, cool, so clearly, you can't see our true selves.

480
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,020
但你能看到这些武器吗
But can you see these weapons?

481
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,190
我看到了
Yeah, I see them.

482
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:13,320
很好 因为这把手枪是你最后能看到的东西了
Good, 'cause this pistol is the last thing you're ever gonna see!

483
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,700
再见 死人
Adios, deados!

484
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,120
不如让他开口
No. What about getting him to talk?

485
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,740
想想你的女儿 想想安格斯
Think about your daughter. About Angus.

486
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,500
他们是我们在这里的原因 对吧
They're the reason we're here, right?

487
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:23,710
该死的
God damn it!

488
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,300
你对火车上的人做了什么
What did you do with the people from the train?

489
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,380
吃了一只角蟾蜍
Eat a horn toad!

490
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,930
-噢 我的天 -这就来了
- Oh, boy. - Mmm-hmm.

491
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,570
快出来吧
Come on out!

492
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,990
再多一点儿 他就啪了
Any more, and he'll pop.

493
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:00,120
我说 求你了
I'll talk. Please!

494
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:12,500
那就继续说吧
Go on, then. Talk.

495
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,470
好的 好的 有个死人
Okay. Okay, okay. There's this deado.

496
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:18,180
是我见过的最烂的 他的名字叫奥蒂斯
The worst I've ever seen. Goes by the name Otis.

497
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:21,970
奥蒂斯·克莱伯恩 他和大多数死人不一样
Otis claiborne. And he ain't like most deados.

498
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,470
他更强大
He's more powerful.

499
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,690
他强迫我和那些接管了其他萨缪尔的灵魂
He forced me and the souls that took over the other Samuels

500
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:29,770
绑架人们去红溪镇
to kidnap people and deliver them to red creek.

501
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,480
红溪镇 就是犹他州的红溪镇
Red creek? As in red creek, Utah?

502
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,820
是的
Yeah.

503
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,950
也许小小的警局并不是浪费时间
Maybe this little diversion wasn't a waste of time, after all.

504
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:41,410
你为这个奥蒂斯 抓人多久了
And how long you been rounding up folks for this Otis'?

505
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:43,950
大约一个月 自从他出现之后
About a month. Since he showed up.

506
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,790
就是在门户裂缝的同一时间
That's around the same time as the gateway rupture.

507
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:51,000
你觉得这个奥蒂斯可能是哈诺所说的“地狱般的放电”
You reckon this Otis could be the "hellish discharge" hano was on about?

508
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,250
在前往地狱的路上灵魂可以逃跑
Souls can escape on their way into hell

509
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,340
但从来没人能够重新出来
but none have ever gotten back out.

510
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:58,260
这个奥蒂斯和被绑架的人有什么关系
What business does this Otis have with the kidnapped folk?

511
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,340
他把他们关起来了 让他们保持健康
He's locking them up. Keeping them healthy.

512
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,720
他有大计划 这是肯定的
He's got something big planned. That's for sure.

513
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:05,310
而且很快就会结束 以上就是我所知道的
And it's goin' down soon. That's all I know!

514
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,270
这就意味着安格斯可能还活着
Means Angus might still be alive.

515
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:11,520
听着 我们只是想在你们冥警面前保持低调
Look, we was just trying to lay low from you ripd.

516
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:15,400
但奥蒂斯有一种非常可怕的方式
But Otis has a real scary way about him.

517
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,400
我并不为我所做的事情感到骄傲
I ain't proud of what I done,

518
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:20,950
但他威胁说 如果我们不帮忙 就把我们全灭了
but he threatened to wipe us all out if we didn't help.

519
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:23,580
那他到底要怎么做呢
And how exactly was he going to do that?

520
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,950
死人不可能消灭其他死人
Deados can't wipe out other deados.

521
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:29,580
有了这些 他们就可以了
With one of those, they can.

522
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:35,050
为什么这个叫奥蒂斯的家伙会有冥界警局的枪支
Now why would this Otis fella have himself an ripd equalizer?

523
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:38,260
我不知道 但这绝不是好事儿
I don't know. But it's not good.

524
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,720
我们需要去红溪镇
We need to get to red creek.

525
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,260
那群死人回来了
That deado crew has returned.

526
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,050
但他们只带回了八个人
But they only brought back eight more.

527
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:26,680
我会让他们在午夜前最后一跑
I'll get them to do one last run before midnight.

528
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,480
他们的首领说他们结束了 这次是永久的
Their leader said they're done. For good this time.

529
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,150
看来他们想在冥界警局开始行动之前离开
Seems they want out before any ripd start moving in.

530
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,110
是这样吗
Is that so?

531
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:39,230
他还说了什么
What else did he say?

532
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,740
他觉得我们不该如此盲目地...
He doesn't think we should all be following you with such...

533
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,620
追随你
Blind faith.

534
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,490
他们在质疑你的身世
They are questioning your origins.

535
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,950
说你到底是谁
Who you say you really are.

536
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,250
那你呢
And you?

537
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:55,080
你怀疑我的身世吗
Do you doubt who I say I am?

538
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:58,380
只是…
It's just...

539
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:02,090
他们在质疑你是怎么出来的
They're questioning how you got out.

540
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,570
作为三个之一 我有自由
As one of the three, I had the freedom

541
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:25,740
在冥界的各个圈子里游荡
to roam all circles of the underworld.

542
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,990
在那次满月月食 我通过边缘逃了出来
I escaped through limbo during that full moon eclipse

543
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,330
当时门户很弱
when a fragment of the gateway grew weak.

544
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:38,130
现在 今晚的血月完成了第四个阶段的月运周期
Now, tonight's blood moon completes a tetradic lunar cycle,

545
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:42,170
使得整个门户在午夜时分变得脆弱不堪
making the entire gateway weak and vulnerable at midnight.

546
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,430
那是我们让人类干活的时候
That's when we put the humans to work.

547
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,680
这给了他们六小时
It gives them six hours to toil

548
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,270
直到门户在黎明时分再次加固
until the gateway strengthens again at dawn,

549
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:56,560
使门户不能再被穿越
making it impossible to penetrate once more.

550
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:01,110
所以我们需要尽可能多的人手
This is why we need as many hands as we can get.

551
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:04,070
因为如果他们失败了...
Because if they fail...

552
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,860
再过25年
It will be another quarter of a century

553
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:10,160
门户就会再次处于最脆弱的状态
before the gateway is at its weakest once again.

554
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:16,960
我厌倦了在下面争夺控制权
I was tired of fighting for control down below.

555
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:21,340
我逃到地球上接管我自己的统治权
I escaped to rule over my own dominion here on earth.

556
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,800
我不能等几小时 更不用说25年了
I can barely wait a few hours, let alone a quarter of a century.

557
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,760
现在你告诉我
Now you tell me.

558
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,810
我也要为你对我的信任而战吗
Do I also have to fight for your belief in me as well?

559
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,190
不 我跟随你
No, I'm with you.

560
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,520
真的
I am.

561
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,360
我相信你能给我们带来人间地狱
I believe you can deliver us hell on earth.

562
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,070
但…
But...

563
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,320
但是什么
But what?

564
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:48,110
我不能再为其他人说话了
I can no longer speak for the others.

565
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:52,620
那我们就去让大家开开眼界吧
Well, let's go open everyone's eyes, then.

566
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:55,580
你要对我抱有信心
If you're gonna put faith in me,

567
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,750
我不希望瞎眼看不见
i no longer want it to be blind.

568
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:12,510
你确定我们不能把这个死胖子干掉吗 他在拖我们的后腿
Are you sure we can't just pop this dead weight? He's holding us back.

569
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,140
处决不是冥界警局的范围
Execution is not ripd policy.

570
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,770
一旦我们完成了 哈诺会让他重新回到地狱
Once we're done, hano will have him redirected back to hell.

571
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:19,560
他的命运已经注定了
His fate has already been sealed.

572
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:22,520
把我放在马背上 霍西普斯小姐
Just put me on the back of the horse, miss horciphus.

573
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,110
我们会更快地到达那里
We'll get there much quicker.

574
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:26,490
我会紧紧抓住你的 我保证
I'll hold on to you real tight. I promise.

575
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:31,110
我们会让彼此都很温暖 对吧  你说呢
We'll keep each other nice and toasty, huh? What do you say?

576
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:34,160
我会给他一个战斗的机会 10秒开始
I'll give him a fighting chance. Ten seconds start.

577
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,870
毕竟 他确实杀了我
He did kill me, after all.

578
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:39,330
“最好的报复不是造成伤害”
"The best revenge is to be unlike him who caused the injury."

579
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:41,670
你是在向我引用圣经吗
You quoting the Bible on me now?

580
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:44,040
不 马库斯·奥雷利乌斯说的
No. Marcus aurelius said that.

581
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:46,460
和你一样 他也是罗马人
Like you, he was a Roman, too.

582
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,760
罗伊·赛弗斯不是罗马人 那是家庭姓氏
Roycephus ain't Roman. It's a family name.

583
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,590
好的 我知道了 消息已收到
Okay. I got it. Message received.

584
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,760
你不是说"罗伊·赛普"吗 发消息给“罗伊·赛普”
Don't you mean "Roy-ceiphed"? Message "Roy-ceiphed."

585
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:58,930
明白吗 因为你是罗伊·赛...
Get it? 'Cause your name is royceph...

586
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,900
-蛇咬人的时候到了 -蛇什么
- Oh! Here come the snake bites. - Snake what?

587
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,280
对不起 好吗  该死
I'm sorry, okay? Damn!

588
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,490
你带我进局子的时候 我一定要起诉
I'm gonna file a complaint when you take me in.

589
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,410
说到命运 我得感谢你
Speaking of fate, I gotta thank you.

590
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,210
因为你在峡谷救了我一命
For, uh, saving my life back at the canyon.

591
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,670
他让我死了
He had me dead to rights.

592
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,630
这对你来说并不容易 是吗
That wasn't easy for you, was it?

593
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:31,970
承认你无法独自完成任务
Admitting you can't do it alone.

594
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:34,450
我不是在承认什么 我只是说谢谢你支持我
I'm not admitting anything, I'm just saying thanks for having my back.

595
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:35,470
别把事情弄得太尴尬了
Don't make this awkward.

596
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:36,560
不客气
You're welcome.

597
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,640
但我在那里救的不是你的命
But it wasn't your life that I saved back there.

598
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,560
而是更重要的东西
But something far more important.

599
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:43,850
你的灵魂
Your soul.

600
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:48,820
那么 告诉我 你亲爱的离世的米莉
So tell me, your dearly departed Millie,

601
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,990
你觉得她的结局是“上”还是“下”
do you think she ended "up" or "down"?

602
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:54,160
看到我是如何走向珍珠门户的
Well seeing how I was heading to the pearly gates,

603
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,830
那个好女人可能在前排有座位
that damn fine woman probably has a seat in the front row.

604
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,660
期待着加入她
Looking forward to joining her.

605
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,080
希望她正在等你
Hopefully, she is waiting for you.

606
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,250
噢 嘿
Oh, hey!

607
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:11,170
-这又是什么 -没什么
- What's that now? - Oh, nothing.

608
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,760
-这只是… -只是什么
- It's just... - it's just what?

609
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,720
只是天堂里有很多好人
It's just there are a lot of good men in heaven.

610
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,930
非常好的人
Very good men.

611
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,680
我听说他们都很帅
Good looking, so I hear.

612
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:24,390
也许她移情别恋了
Maybe she moved on.

613
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,100
他们能吗
They can do that?

614
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,230
能
Yeah.

615
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,900
该死
Damn!

616
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,110
我以为我死后
I thought when I died,

617
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,280
米莉和我会永远在一起
Millie and I would be together for eternity.

618
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:41,040
永远和你一起 罗伊
Eternity? Together with you, Roy?

619
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,830
不 不 不 不
No, no, no, no.

620
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:46,380
那对可怜的米莉来说更像是地狱 你不觉得吗
That would be more like hell for poor Millie. Don't you think?

621
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,880
会的 会的
Yeah, it would. It would.

622
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,750
你在笑什么 什么
What are you laughing at? What?

623
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,960
我只是在嘲笑你
I'm just breaking your noix.

624
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:54,050
嘲笑我什么
Breaking my what?

625
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:55,970
嘲笑你的蛋蛋
Your, uh, this, only for boys.

626
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,930
-我的蛋蛋 -是的
- Breaking my nuts? - Yes.

627
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:00,100
你在嘲笑我的蛋蛋
You were breaking my nuts?

628
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,680
-好主意 -是的
- That was a good one. - Yes!

629
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:03,890
噢 你骗到了我
Oh, you got me.

630
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,020
- 我骗到了你 -是的
- I got you. - Yeah.

631
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,060
你也骗到了我 她很有趣
You got me, too. Man, she's funny.

632
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,150
很奇怪 但很有趣
Weird, but funny.

633
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,440
我现在要闭嘴了 告诉罗伊·赛普
I'll shut up now. Message Roy-ceiphed.

634
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:14,530
我是说收到 噢 该死
I mean received. Aw, shit.

635
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:50,270
我听说这是你唯一能做的了
I heard this was all you could muster.

636
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:53,440
关于我们的绑架案的消息传开了
Word's getting around about our kidnappings,

637
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:55,940
所以很少有人能在这里聚集
so it's rare to find anybody gathering around here at all.

638
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,030
我们最后的两场比赛都是在边境上
Our last two scores had to be over the border.

639
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:03,910
就像我所说的 我们这里结束了
Like I said, we're done here now.

640
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,170
你真的不想留下来成为创建世界
You really don't wanna stay and be a part of the foundation

641
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:16,130
新秩序基础的一部分吗
that creates a new world order?

642
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:21,180
你不想见证真正符合圣经的东西吗
You don't wanna witness something truly biblical?

643
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:35,110
你对我没有信心 真是太可惜了
What a shame you have no faith in me.

644
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:38,990
因为当我带领同类在地球上进行伟大的接管时
Because when I lead our kind in earth's great takeover,

645
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:43,030
你本可以在主桌前占有一席之地
you could have had a seat at the main table.

646
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:00,380
看着我吧
Look at me!

647
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:02,010
睁开你的眼睛
Open your eyes.

648
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:05,470
我说 睁开你的眼睛
I said, open your eyes!

649
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,810
信我
And believe!

650
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,330
你觉得留下来怎样
How do you feel about staying?

651
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:31,830
去帮助其他人
Go help the others.

652
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:37,170
我想给这些新来的人戴上面罩 喂水 喂食
I want these new ones masked up, watered and fed.

653
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:39,800
我需要他们都能胜任未来的工作
I need them all fit for the work ahead.

654
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,490
你觉得还会有人怀疑我的现在吗
You think anyone doubts who I am now?

655
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,410
我们来玩个游戏叫“我们活着的时候”
Let's play a game called "when we were alive."

656
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:15,630
那么 当你活着的时候 你喜欢什么
So, when you were alive, what'd you prefer?

657
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:18,380
威士忌还是杜松子酒
Whiskey or gin?

658
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:20,380
连衣裙还是紧身衣
Dresses or tights?

659
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:22,130
鸡肉还是牛排
Chicken or steak?

660
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,340
你知道该怎么做
You know what to do.

661
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:26,050
又来了
Come again?

662
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:35,560
其实开始发痒了
It's actually starting to tickle.

663
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:36,690
该死
Damn it!

664
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:39,900
华尔兹还是探戈
The waltz or tango?

665
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,530
咖啡还是茶
Coffee or tea?

666
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:45,570
酒吧还是妓院
Saloons or brothels?

667
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:48,990
日出还是日落
Sunrise or sunset?

668
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,410
长发 短发
Long hair, short hair?

669
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,540
传教士式还是狗爬式
Missionary or doggy-style?

670
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:58,170
我开始喜欢上这个了
I'm starting to like that.

671
00:45:59,170 --> 00:46:00,340
我们到了吗
Are we there yet?

672
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,970
“太阳将变成黑暗
"The sun will turn into darkness,

673
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:07,260
“月亮也变成血
"and the moon into blood,

674
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:09,350
“在那伟大而可怕的日子到来之前”
"before the great and terrible day comes."

675
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:11,470
我猜那不是马库斯·奥勒利乌斯的句子
Guessing that's not Marcus aurelius?

676
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,770
《约珥书》
The book ofjoel.

677
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:15,560
这种情绪在《使徒行传》和《启示录》中得到了呼应 标志着...
The sentiment is echoed in acts and revelations, signifying...

678
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:16,950
时代结束的开始
The beginning of the end of times?

679
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:19,900
哈诺把我送回地球也是这个欢快的音符
Yeah, hano sent me back to earth with that same cheery note.

680
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:21,940
过了那个山脊就是红溪镇
Just over that Ridge is red creek.

681
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:24,650
如果我是你 我会回头的
I'd turn back if I were you.

682
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:27,860
规则是这样的
Here are the rules.

683
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:31,830
如果你打开臭嘴 告诉别人我们的真实身份
You open that rancid piehole of yours and you tell anyone who we really are,

684
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:33,950
你就要吃一颗子弹
You eat one of these bullets.

685
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:37,250
你甚至暗示我们是冥界警局…
You even imply that we're ripd...

686
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:38,830
你就吃一颗这样的子弹吧
You eat one of these here bullets.

687
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:45,090
事实上 在我没有允许你说话的情况下 你就说话了...
In fact you speak without me allowing you to speak...

688
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:46,800
我就吃了其中一颗子弹
I eat one of them there bullets?

689
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,010
你并不像表面那么笨
You're not as dumb as you look.

690
00:46:56,350 --> 00:46:58,810
你真他妈的难看
You so damn ugly.

691
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:01,270
好主意
Good idea.

692
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,480
我们不希望任何人知道我们有他
We don't want anyone recognizing we have him.

693
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:05,990
是的 所以我这样做
Yeah. That's why I did it.

694
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,610
那是什么味道
What's that smell?

695
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:28,760
两个黑女人用绳子拉着头罩男
Two black women are pulling a hooded man through town

696
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,720
穿过小镇 就没人眨眼吗
with a rope and no one bats an eyelid?

697
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:36,850
他们似乎病得太重 什么都没注意到
They seem too ill to notice anything.

698
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:38,600
我想知道他们得了什么病
Yeah, I wonder what's ailing them.

699
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,650
几个月前 霍乱袭击了黑池
Cholera hit Blackpool a few months back.

700
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:50,860
你听到了吗
You hear that?

701
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:54,160
-我什么也没听到 -正是如此
- I hear nothing. - Exactly.

702
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:58,160
就在你觉得事情不可能更奇怪的时候...
Just when you think things couldn't get any stranger...

703
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:03,790
空荡荡的酒馆 不管这里发生了什么 都发生得很匆忙
An empty saloon. Whatever happened here, happened in a hurry.

704
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:08,840
孩子们 人都去哪儿了
Boys, where is everyone?

705
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,720
这就对了 全部堆起来
That's right! Pile it all up.

706
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,220
来 现在继续走 这就对了
Come on, keep it moving now. Come on. There you go.

707
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:20,140
你所有的捐款都将用于善业
All your donations are going to a damn fine cause,

708
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,390
我向你保证 所以…
I assure you, so...

709
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,810
抬起头来 再过一个受祝福的夜晚...
Keep those heads up and have another blessed Eve...

710
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:26,820
谁是蛇油推销员
Who's the snake oil salesman?

711
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,200
啊 朱利叶斯·巴特菲尔德 他拥有酒馆
Ah, Julius butterfield. He owns the saloon,

712
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:33,820
马厩 杂货店 当地的印刷厂和旅馆
livery stables, general store, the local printing press and the hotel.

713
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:35,910
噢 对了 他也是镇长
Oh, yeah. He's also the mayor.

714
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:37,240
似乎是公平的选举
Seems like a fair election.

715
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:45,500
好的 我听到了 我听到你了
Okay, I got you. I got you.

716
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:48,050
请原谅我迟钝
Forgive my tarness.

717
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:51,220
有些时候 我至少需要五个我才能完成...
There are days I need at least five of me to get all I need...

718
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:53,380
所有的工作
done.

719
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:57,390
噢 不 不 不
Oh, no, no, no.

720
00:48:57,470 --> 00:48:58,520
你们...
You...

721
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,890
你们得离开 你们不应该在这里
You're gonna have to leave. You should not be in here.

722
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,480
当然 我们必须可以
Sure, we should!

723
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,110
我们是赏金猎人
We're bounty hunters.

724
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:08,690
姐妹们 从德克萨斯州的班德拉一路过来的
Sisters. All the way from bandera, Texas.

725
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:12,610
我们需要住宿 而这是一家旅馆
We require lodgings. And this is a hotel.

726
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:14,780
那他就是你的赏金了
He your bounty then?

727
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,870
你并不像表面那么笨
You're not as dumb as you look.

728
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,450
好吧 也许你们两个都是…
Well, maybe you both are...

729
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,040
因为你似乎不识字
Because it appears that you can't read.

730
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,000
不接待有色人种

731
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:27,920
现在离开
Now leave.

732
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:29,920
你在犯法
You're breaking the law.

733
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:32,840
只是因为法律 但并不意味着法律是正确的
Just 'cause it's a law, don't make it right.

734
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,010
我要请你把这个拿下来
I'm gonna ask you to take that down.

735
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:38,640
只要我有机会
Just as soon as I get that chance.

736
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:49,650
烧掉它
Burn it.

737
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:52,490
不需要你来告诉我该怎么做
You don't tell me what to do.

738
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:56,950
就现在
Now.

739
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,160
好吧
Right.

740
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:02,700
你说得对
You're right.

741
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:05,710
资本主义是色盲
Capitalism is colorblind.

742
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:08,290
毕竟 更开放意味着赚更多的钱
And being more open means making more money, after all.

743
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:10,550
谢谢
Thank you.

744
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:13,460
好吧
All right.

745
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:33,820
你没事儿吧
You all right?

746
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,250
贝弗利
Bevedy!

747
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:51,210
是 先生
Yes, sir!

748
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,010
那些“先生”的废话是什么意思
What's all that "sir" nonsense?

749
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:58,970
我告诉过你 对你和其他人 就得喊我老“朱利叶斯”
I told you it's just plain old "Julius" to you and everyone else.

750
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:01,180
我们在这里都是一样的
We're all one and the same around here.

751
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:05,560
现在 贝弗利 请你带我们的客人
Now, Beverly would you please be so kind

752
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:09,400
去5号房间好吗
as to show our guests here to room 5?

753
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:13,980
谢谢
Thank you.

754
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:16,570
入住愉快
Enjoy your stay.

755
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:20,780
跟我来 女士们
Follow me, ladies.

756
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:30,670
请原谅我这么问 但我认出了你赏金手臂上的胎记
Pardon my asking, but I recognize the birthmark on the arm of your bounty.

757
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:33,840
他和他的队伍最近在镇上进出了好几次
He and his posse have been in and out of town a few times of late.

758
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,710
介意我问问你为什么要抓他吗
Mind if I enquire what you got him for?

759
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,340
杀害一名美国法警
Killing a us marshal.

760
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:40,180
我告诉过你 我没杀任何人...
I told you, I ain't kill no...

761
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,930
但你不用担心 贝弗利小姐
But don't you worry none, miss Beverly.

762
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:43,850
我们会密切关注他的
We're gonna keep a real close eye on him.

763
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:45,560
我并不害怕他
I ain't afraid of him.

764
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:49,980
他的搭档们都是很令人讨厌的 但他人很好
His partners were plain nasty. But he was, uh, nice.

765
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:51,230
谢谢
Yes, thank you.

766
00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:52,480
进来吧
Come on in.

767
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,610
我希望这里有你们需要的一切
I hope it has everything you need.

768
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,700
请原谅我的好奇心
Excuse my own inquisitiveness,

769
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:08,250
贝弗利小姐
miss Beverly,

770
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:12,080
但这镇上有什么病
but what ails the town?

771
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:17,880
没人知道
No one knows for sure.

772
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:20,090
大约一个月前开始的
Started about a month ago.

773
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,760
巴特菲尔德先生说这与供水有关
Mr. Butterfield says it has to do with the water supply.

774
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:26,510
但这话只能在你我和床柱之间说
But between you and me and the bedpost,

775
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:29,890
我觉得这是伎俩 以便他卖更多的威士忌
I think that's just a ploy for him to sell more whiskey.

776
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:31,600
卖给谁
To who?

777
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,310
附近几乎没人
There ain't barely anyone around.

778
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,610
镇民昨晚都死光了
Town emptied out dead of last night.

779
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:40,650
巴特菲尔德先生说在不远处发现了黄金
Mr. Butterfield says gold was struck not far away.

780
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,990
似乎每个人都想在一无所有之前分得一杯羹
Seems everyone must want a piece before there's nothing left.

781
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:49,140
如果真是这样 我估计老巴特菲尔德的棺材板
If that was the case, I reckon old butterfield would have been the first

782
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,410
第一个按不住了
to break ground.

783
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:52,870
你真的相信他吗
Do you really believe him?

784
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:56,170
我没有太多选择
I don't have much of a choice.

785
00:52:57,170 --> 00:52:58,170
请原谅我
Pardon me.

786
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:03,530
我建议你们把门锁好
I suggest you keep your door locked.

787
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:09,390
你听到她说的了 她说我人很好
You heard her. She said I'm nice.

788
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:10,930
她说的不对
She ain't well.

789
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:12,770
她把你们和别人搞混了
Confusing you with someone else.

790
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:15,150
我是说 死人可以是好人吗
I mean, can a deado be nice?

791
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:17,190
根据我的经验不是
Not in my extended expenence.

792
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:19,730
看看现在是谁在挑剔
Well, look who's discriminating now.

793
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:22,990
空气中一定有什么东西让人生病
There must be something in the air making everybody sick.

794
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:26,370
所以它没有影响到我们 换句话说 就是死人
That's why it's not affecting any of us. In other words, the dead.

795
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:28,080
而且我觉得...
And I think...

796
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:32,040
是从上面来的
It's coming from up there.

797
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,290
嗯 在哪儿
Hmm? Up where?

798
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,550
爸爸 爸爸
Daddy! Daddy!

799
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:51,220
别离开我 别离开我
Stay with me! Stay with me!

800
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,230
别这样 别这样
Don't, don't! Don't, don't!

801
00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:57,520
求你了 我得让爸爸复活
Please! I've got to revive my daddy.

802
00:53:57,610 --> 00:53:59,520
-求你了... -不 不
- Please... - no, no, no.

803
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:03,860
看 他还在我们身边儿 就让他休息吧
Look, he's still with us. Just let him rest.

804
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:08,280
听着 女士 如果脱下面罩 你就会死
Listen, lady. Up here, if you take off that mask, you will die.

805
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:09,530
而且很快
And fast.

806
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:11,040
你怎么知道
How do you know?

807
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:13,910
我看到过
I've seen it happen.

808
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:34,890
好吧 停下来 你表达得很清楚了
Okay! Stop it! You've made your point.

809
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:37,520
好了
Okay!

810
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:51,330
他们想对我们所有人做什么
What do they want with us all?

811
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:52,830
我不知道
I don't know.

812
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:56,000
我有一种感觉 我们很快就会明白的
I have a feeling that we'll come to understand real soon.

813
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:58,290
你们在看什么
What are you looking at?

814
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:37,870
该死
God damn it!

815
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:45,300
你们得把所有的设备都运到矿上
You gotta get all the equipment up to the mine.

816
00:55:46,170 --> 00:55:47,720
没有时间可以浪费了
There's no time to waste.

817
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,720
我们要在一小时内打开门户
We start opening the gateway in less than an hour.

818
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,140
你想要什么 巴特菲尔德
What do you want, butterfield?

819
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:01,230
听着 奥蒂斯
Listen. Otis.

820
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:03,730
到目前为止 我已经做了所有要求我做的事情 不是吗
I've done everything asked of me so far, havent I?

821
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,650
几天前你们确实想从我身边儿逃走 记得吗
You did try and run away from me a few days ago, remember?

822
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:10,450
好 好 但从那时起
Okay, okay, but since then,

823
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:13,030
我对你们的要求不能再宽容了
I couldn't have been more accommodating to your needs,

824
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,240
不管你们的要求有多苛刻
no matter how felonious or demanding.

825
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,040
但求你们了
But, please.

826
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:20,790
我恳求你们
I'm begging you.

827
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:24,170
我所要的回报是其中之一
All I want in return is one of these.

828
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:30,220
我告诉过你只用于工人
I told you they're for workers only.

829
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:33,470
你打算成为工人吗
Are you gonna be one?

830
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:35,720
我说过 我有镇子要管理
I told you, I got a town to run.

831
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:37,390
你没有多少人了
You don't have much of one left.

832
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:38,980
那是因为你们把所有人都带走了
Because you've taken everyone!

833
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:40,430
不 求你了
No! Please!

834
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:46,360
不 不 不 求你了
No, no, no. Please.

835
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:50,420
求你了 有几个健康的人刚住进旅馆
Please! A couple of healthy ones just checked into the hotel.

836
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,950
把他们也带走
Take them, too.

837
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:54,240
只要给我面罩
Just give me a mask.

838
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:56,830
我不想死
I don't wanna die.

839
00:56:56,910 --> 00:56:59,410
死亡并不是那么糟糕
Death is not so bad.

840
00:57:01,290 --> 00:57:06,000
事实上 有时它是一种全新生活的开始
In fact, sometimes it's the beginning of a whole new kind of life.

841
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:08,090
我是说 看看我们
I mean, look at us,

842
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:13,340
我们可以呼吸各种有毒的空气 而你们却不能
we can breathe all kinds of toxic air that you can't in your current form.

843
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,980
我不是向你们的尸体承诺过同样的重生吗
And didn't I promise your body the same sort of rebirth

844
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:28,400
如果你们能给我们一点合作和热情
if you just showed us a little cooperation and hospitality?

845
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:29,650
而我有
And I have.

846
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:31,900
我做了一切
I've done everything.

847
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:34,910
我只是想让我的小镇回来
I just... I just want my town back.

848
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:39,540
明天对你来说是新一天的黎明
Tomorrow is the dawn of a new day for you.

849
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:44,460
也是全人类的
And all mankind.

850
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,000
去吧
Go on.

851
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:48,290
拿着它
Take it.

852
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:51,260
这是你的了
It's yours.

853
00:58:05,770 --> 00:58:08,150
你们在山上做什么呢
What are you all even doing up that mountain anyways?

854
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:12,780
现在你戴上了面罩 你就会知道了
Well now that you have that mask on, you're gonna find out.

855
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,820
奥蒂斯 拜托
Otis, please!

856
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:19,870
奥蒂斯
Otis!

857
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:21,910
-奥蒂斯 -回来
-Otis! - Get back.

858
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:27,920
该死 闻起来像马的蛋蛋
Damn! Smelt like a horse's ding-dong under there

859
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,080
你们会知道的 在哪儿...
you would know. Where is...

860
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:31,420
奥蒂斯把那些被绑架者关在哪儿
Otis keeping the kidnappees?

861
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:33,920
我们把他们送到了教堂 我就知道这么多 真的
We delivered them to the church. That's all I know. Promise.

862
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:38,010
你在干嘛 我可以帮忙
What are you doing? I can help!

863
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:40,220
-不错的尝试 -你留在原地
- Nice try hoss. - You're staying put.

864
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:42,390
你的嘴唇比没有下巴的骡子还要松
You got looser lips than a jawless mule.

865
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:44,180
你要待在这里
You're gonna stay right here.

866
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:45,350
拜托
Come on!

867
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:48,650
那是在苍蝇的季节里 像公牛的屁股一样紧
That is tight as a bull's ass in fly season.

868
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:51,570
听着 给我机会来证明我自己
Look, give me a chance to prove myself!

869
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:53,730
求你了 我不想去地狱
Please. I don't wanna go to hell.

870
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:55,820
我们现在什么也做不了
Nothing we can do about that now.

871
00:58:56,570 --> 00:58:58,860
我活着的时候也没做过什么坏事儿
I didn't do nothing that bad when I was alive.

872
00:58:58,950 --> 00:59:00,410
很显然 你做得够多了
Clearly, you did enough.

873
00:59:00,490 --> 00:59:03,410
我是说 我就只偷了一些东西
I mean, I stole some stuff.

874
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:04,580
只是一些吗
Just some?

875
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:06,540
好吧 比一些多一些
Okay, a little more than some.

876
00:59:08,330 --> 00:59:10,170
是很多 我偷了很多东西
A lot. I stole a lot of stuff.

877
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:11,710
事实上 我被称为“大黄蜂”
In fact, I was called "bumble,"

878
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:14,510
因为我的手比蜂巢还粘 看到了吗
on account of my hands were stickier than a beehive. See?

879
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,800
嘿 那是我的新苏西
Hey! That's my new susie!

880
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:22,100
你把你的枪叫做“苏西”
You call your gun "susie"?

881
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:25,060
是啊 以我亲爱的老奶奶的名字命名的
Yeah, named it after my dear old meemaw.

882
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:28,190
你用你奶奶的名字给灵魂杀手命名 还说我偏执
You named a soul killer after your grandma and I'm the twisted one?

883
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:31,110
你该去地狱 而不是… 我想说
You should be going to hell, not... my point is,

884
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:33,900
我刚才可以把你俩的灵魂都炸成灰
I could have blown both your souls to dustjust now.

885
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:35,150
但我没有
But I didn't.

886
00:59:36,190 --> 00:59:38,950
因为我想让你们知道你们可以信任我
'Cause I want you to know you can trust me.

887
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:42,370
偷窃是不对的 我知道
Stealing ain't right, I know that.

888
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:44,620
但比起那些附体了其他萨缪尔小子的灵魂来说
But it ain't nothing compared to them souls

889
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:46,580
这真不算什么
that took over the other Samuel boys.

890
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:50,290
你们听到贝弗利说 那些死人比蛇还凶残
You heard Beverly, them deados are meaner than out snakes.

891
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:51,790
我也不喜欢他们
And I ain't like them.

892
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:56,840
你们觉得我们被判处同一罪名 公平吗
You think it's fair that we all getjudged to end up in the same awful place?

893
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:07,600
怎么了
What is it?

894
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,270
有没有可能是老史莱姆 真正的史莱姆
Is there a chance that old slim, the real slim,

895
01:00:10,350 --> 01:00:12,480
他的一小部分仍然在那里
a little part of him is still in there?

896
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:15,070
不 史莱姆早就不在了
No. Slim is long gone.

897
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:17,690
这个“大黄蜂”的灵魂现在完全被控制了
This "bumble" soul is in complete control now.

898
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,570
而且他在玩弄你呢 罗伊
And he's playing you, Roy.

899
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:22,950
死人会做任何事儿来避免下地狱
Deados will do anything to avoid going to hell.

900
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:24,990
别被愚弄了
Don't be fooled.

901
01:00:25,950 --> 01:00:26,950
现在走吧
Now let's go.

902
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:33,040
我不想去地狱 我不属于那里
I don't wanna go to hell. I don't belong there!

903
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:36,210
求你们了 让我证明给你们看 求你们了
Please! Let me prove it to you. I can prove it to you, please.

904
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:38,760
-我说走 罗伊 -求你们了
-I said, let's go, Roy. - Please!

905
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:43,300
求你们了 请回来吧
Please! Please come back!

906
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:45,890
我不想去地狱
I don't wanna go to hell!

907
01:00:47,350 --> 01:00:49,980
求你们了 我不属于那里
Please! I don't belong there!

908
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:02,660
愿上帝怜悯他们的灵魂
God have mercy on their souls.

909
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:06,240
抱歉
Sorry.

910
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:09,910
亵渎上帝之家是终极大罪
The desecration of a house of god is the ultimate sin.

911
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,160
终极
Ultimate?

912
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:15,750
绑架 伤害儿童 谋杀 稍微高一点 但各人有各人的看法
Kidnapping, hurting children, murder, tad bit higher, but to each their own.

913
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:19,960
至少我们知道史莱姆说的是实话
At least we know slim was telling the truth.

914
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:22,930
安格斯在这里 他被带走的那天就穿着这个
Angus was here. He was wearing this the day he was taken.

915
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,550
谁来帮帮我
Help me somebody!

916
01:01:25,930 --> 01:01:28,810
救救我 拜托 有人吗
Help me, please! Anybody!

917
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:32,270
有人在吗 求你们了 任何人 救命…
Is anybody there? Please! Anybody, help...

918
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:34,350
巴特菲尔德
Butterfield?

919
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,530
你们在那里做什么
What the hell are you doing in there?

920
01:01:39,610 --> 01:01:41,570
这个奥蒂斯和他的一群疯子
This guy Otis and his bunch of madmen!

921
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:43,110
他们占领了我整个镇子
They've seized my entire town,

922
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,470
骑着马 把我扔到这辆车的后面…
just rode right in here, threw me in the back of this Van...

923
01:01:45,490 --> 01:01:47,410
慢点说 他们把所有人都带到哪里去了
Slow down! Where'd they take everyone?

924
01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:49,030
上山
Up the mountain.

925
01:01:49,870 --> 01:01:51,790
但那里唯一的东西是老矿
But the only thing up there is an old mine.

926
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:53,880
没人在那里走运 因为…
Ain't no one struck it lucky up there for...

927
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:55,080
-门户 -是的
- The gateway! - Yeah.

928
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:58,630
我确实听到奥蒂斯说了关于“打开门户”
I did hear Otis say something about "opening a gateway."

929
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:01,920
空气中的有毒气体
The poisonous gas in the air is seeping through the gateway

930
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:03,760
正从地狱深处的门户渗入
from the depths of hell.

931
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:06,550
那道裂缝是奥蒂斯的灵魂在逃跑
That rupture was Otis's soul escaping.

932
01:02:08,510 --> 01:02:10,600
-主啊 -你们为什么要祈祷
- Oh, lord. - Why are you praying?

933
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:15,600
奥蒂斯要利用人类来把整个事情破解开
Otis is going to use the humans to crack the whole thing wide open.

934
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:17,730
-为什么 这样他就能回去了 -不是
- Why, so he can get back inside? - No.

935
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:20,320
这样他就能让那些被诅咒的灵魂重新出来
So he can let the souls of the damned back out.

936
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:22,440
-罗伊 -罗伊
- Roy. - Roy?

937
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:25,990
奥蒂斯要利用那些挖掘工 把他们变成死人
Otis is going to use those digging humans and turn them into deados.

938
01:02:26,070 --> 01:02:28,820
在那之后 他们会不断涌出
After that, they'll keep pouring out,

939
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:31,120
最终接管…
eventually taking over and...

940
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,330
并附体全世界
Possessing the rest of the world.

941
01:02:33,870 --> 01:02:35,920
我明白了 时代的终结
I get it. End of times.

942
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,380
但为什么奥蒂斯和他的死人部队不自己去挖呢
But why doesn't Otis and his deado troop just do the digging themselves?

943
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:44,590
像我们一样 他们不受气体的影响 而且比人类更强大 对吧
Like us, they're unaffected by the gas and stronger than the humans, right?

944
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:50,180
上帝创造了防御 一种地球和地狱之间的缓冲区
God created a defense, a kind of buffer between earth and hell

945
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:52,350
以阻止下面的灵魂返回
to stop the souls beneath from returning.

946
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:55,430
那个缓冲区就是所有的人类
That buffer was all of humanity.

947
01:02:55,940 --> 01:03:00,400
只有当他们把灵魂请回来的时候 他们才能够再次复活
Only when they invite the souls back in are they able to rise again.

948
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:01,760
但这永远不会发生
But that would never happen.

949
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:05,280
因为人类永远不会欢迎邪恶回他们的世界
'Cause mankind would never welcome pure evil back into their world.

950
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:07,490
但通过挖开门户
But by digging through the gateway,

951
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,280
这正是他们在做的事情
that's exactly what they're doing.

952
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:22,840
你们刚才说的地狱和“灵魂逃脱”让我迷失了
Okay, you just lost me with all that talk of hell and "souls escaping."

953
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,510
你们女人真是太夸张了
You women can be so overly dramatic.

954
01:03:26,590 --> 01:03:29,970
真的吗 显然你不希望“我们女人”…
Really? Well, clearly you don't want "us women"...

955
01:03:30,050 --> 01:03:31,720
来救你
To save your ass?

956
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,310
不
No!

957
01:03:34,390 --> 01:03:35,430
好 那就自己救自己吧
Fine, just do it yourself!

958
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:47,530
帮个小忙
A little help!

959
01:03:55,870 --> 01:03:56,870
帮个小忙
A little help!

960
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:00,710
-再多帮一点忙 -我正在努力
- A little more help! - I'm trying.

961
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:04,920
给 拿着
Here! Take it.

962
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:37,200
巴特菲尔德先生
Mr. Butterfield!

963
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,500
我有茶和睡帽给你
I have your tea and nightcap for you.

964
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:44,880
巴特菲尔德先生
Mr. Butterfield, sir?

965
01:05:37,010 --> 01:05:39,310
“巴特菲尔德印刷厂”
"Butterfield printing press"?

966
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:41,060
“500份”
"500 copies"?

967
01:06:05,870 --> 01:06:08,210
你没有杀害任何执法人员
You didn't kill no lawman.

968
01:06:09,210 --> 01:06:11,460
你是严重不公正的受害者
You're a victim of a gross injustice.

969
01:06:15,630 --> 01:06:16,640
不可能
No way.

970
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:18,760
现在走吧
Now go.

971
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:20,720
在他们回来之前
Before they come back.

972
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:44,620
我想我快死了
I think I'm dying.

973
01:06:47,330 --> 01:06:49,000
我知道有个东西可能会有帮助
I know something that may help.

974
01:06:58,510 --> 01:07:00,720
把这些东西给那些还在附近的人
Get these to the folks who are still around.

975
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,180
你能帮我吗
Can you help me?

976
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:04,680
我还有别的地方要去
I've got some place else I need to be.

977
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:27,180
-好了吗 -好了 都准备好了 女士
- You guys ready? - Yeah. All set, ma'am.

978
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:28,330
快到午夜了
It's almost midnight.

979
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,420
现在没多少时间了
Not much longer now.

980
01:07:36,590 --> 01:07:37,840
离门远一点儿
Back from the door!

981
01:07:43,970 --> 01:07:45,100
我认得那把剑
I know that sword.

982
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:49,140
我们给自己造了冥界警具
Yeah. We bagged ourselves some ripd.

983
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:07,370
盯紧他们
Don't take your eyes off them.

984
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:12,500
她认出了你们 也能看到我
It looked like she recognized you and could see me.

985
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:17,170
现在我们知道死人的冥界警局武器是从哪儿来的了
Yup. Now we know where those deados got their ripd weapons.

986
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,010
是内尔·博伊斯
That's Nell boyce.

987
01:08:19,090 --> 01:08:21,470
招聘者搞错了
Recruitment got that one all wrong.

988
01:08:21,550 --> 01:08:23,850
她在躲起来之前抢劫了我们的军械库
She robbed our armory before going into hiding.

989
01:08:23,930 --> 01:08:25,770
我猜她找到了值得为之出来的东西
Guess she found something worth coming out for.

990
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:06,010
你还真有几下子啊 小子
You got some stones on you, boy.

991
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:09,390
但有些时候 拯救界需要承认
But sometimes, saving the day requires you to admit

992
01:09:09,470 --> 01:09:11,020
你们无法独自完成
you can't do it alone.

993
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:16,020
你们最好搞些面罩
You should better get some masks.

994
01:09:16,610 --> 01:09:18,730
否则 你们很快就会死
You're gonna croak real fast up in here if you don't.

995
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:21,280
安格斯
Angus?

996
01:09:22,150 --> 01:09:24,200
抱歉 我认识你吗 女士
I'm sorry, do I know you, ma'am?

997
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:25,700
你当然认识 孩子 是我...
Of course you do, son. It's me...

998
01:09:25,780 --> 01:09:27,410
罗...
Ro...

999
01:09:28,450 --> 01:09:29,450
对
Right.

1000
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:32,660
不 呃…
No, uh...

1001
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:35,880
不 你不认识我
No, you, uh, don't know me.

1002
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:37,250
不 呃…
No, um...

1003
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:39,880
我 呃 只是听到…
I, uh, just heard...

1004
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:42,380
你的名字被别人叫出来了
Your name called out by somebody

1005
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:45,260
当你像野马一样
when you were storming out of the cage

1006
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:47,350
冲出笼子的时候
like a wild mustang.

1007
01:09:47,430 --> 01:09:49,100
“安格斯 小心
"Careful, Angus!

1008
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:51,810
“别做傻事儿 安格斯 等等”
"Don't do anything foolish, Angus. And so on."

1009
01:09:51,890 --> 01:09:53,940
现在这些都不重要了 重要的是...
That doesn't matter right now. What matters is...

1010
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:56,610
我现在看到你了
I see you now.

1011
01:09:56,690 --> 01:10:00,150
而你的胆量比我以前觉得的要大得多
And you got much more moxie than I ever gave you credit for.

1012
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:06,160
自从我们认识以来 我一直看错你了
I've been wrong to judge you unkindly since we met.

1013
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:10,330
一直是多久 也许是一分钟前吗
Which was, what, maybe a minute ago?

1014
01:10:10,830 --> 01:10:11,830
小姐...
Miss...

1015
01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:13,460
梅布尔
Mabel.

1016
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:15,500
我叫梅布尔
The name's Mabel.

1017
01:10:16,710 --> 01:10:18,170
你们结婚了吗 安格斯
Are you married, Angus?

1018
01:10:18,710 --> 01:10:20,210
没有 女士
No, ma'am.

1019
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:22,460
但我订婚了
But I'm engaged.

1020
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:25,970
和我见过的最奇妙的人
To the most wondrous human that I've ever met.

1021
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:27,510
她的父亲呢
And her father?

1022
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:29,260
他是英俊的混蛋 是不是
Handsome son of a bitch, ain't he?

1023
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:31,680
什么 我是说… 我猜
What? I mean... I guess?

1024
01:10:31,770 --> 01:10:33,390
不用猜测 我肯定他是
Not a guessing game, I'm sure he is.

1025
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:39,150
我一直都不明白 为什么他从不对我有过好感
You know, I just never understood why he never took a shine to me.

1026
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:45,280
也许他愚蠢地觉得你娶了我… 他的女儿...
Maybe he stupidly thought that you marrying my... his daughter...

1027
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:47,280
你是想取代他
You were trying to replace him.

1028
01:10:47,950 --> 01:10:48,950
而且你知道...
And you know...

1029
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:54,410
几年前 他可怜的老婆得了痘病…
What, with his poor wife taken ill by the pox a few years earlier...

1030
01:10:55,960 --> 01:11:00,710
也许他是害怕自己会被抛弃
Maybe he was scared he'd be left all alone.

1031
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:06,680
你怎么可能知道这一切
How could you possibly know all that?

1032
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:09,300
这是天赋
It's a gift.

1033
01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:13,470
有人称它为女性的直觉
Some call it women's intuition.

1034
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:15,230
让我来问你一个问题
Let me ask you something.

1035
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:19,480
如果他现在就站在这里 你会对他说什么
If he was standing right here, right now, what would you say to him?

1036
01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:23,440
我会说“罗伊…”
Well, I would say, "Roy..."

1037
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:24,780
“英俊的混蛋”
"You handsome son-of-a-bitch,"

1038
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:27,070
从拍马屁开始 对未来的老丈人有帮助
start with flattery, helps with future in-laws.

1039
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:29,740
所以我会说“罗伊...
Um... so I'd say, "Roy...

1040
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:35,200
“我不仅觉得你是...
"Not only do I think that you are...

1041
01:11:35,330 --> 01:11:39,500
-“英俊的混蛋” -英俊的混蛋 但...
- A handsome son-of-a-bitch." - A handsome son-of-a-bitch, but...

1042
01:11:39,580 --> 01:11:43,500
“我只是想让你知道 我永远无法与你竞争
"I just want you to know that I could never compete with you.

1043
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:46,880
“我只希望你知道我是多么的尊敬你
"And I just hope you know how much I respect you.

1044
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:51,470
“如果我能够成为夏洛蒂的老公
"If I can ever be half the husband for my Charlotte

1045
01:11:51,550 --> 01:11:53,640
“你是父亲 那么我...
"that you've been a father, then I...

1046
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:56,140
“我死也值得了”
"I'll die knowing that I got it right."

1047
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:02,400
你会得到机会的 我保证
You're gonna get that chance, I promise you.

1048
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:07,990
为了激发灵感
For inspiration.

1049
01:12:11,780 --> 01:12:13,330
我说过 我有天赋
I told you, I got a gift.

1050
01:12:13,410 --> 01:12:15,620
可以说是超凡脱俗
Otherworldly, you might say.

1051
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:27,960
开始了
Here we go.

1052
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:42,650
是时候了
It's time.

1053
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:45,980
门户比我想象的要弱
Gateway is weaker than I thought.

1054
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:50,320
他们会比预期的更快突破
They'll break through sooner than expected.

1055
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,030
把他们都干掉
Bring 'em all in.

1056
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:55,450
你想对冥界警局做什么
What do you want to do about the ripd?

1057
01:12:58,250 --> 01:13:00,120
我对他们有计划
I got plans for them.

1058
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:14,800
梅布尔 梅布尔
Mabel! Mabel!

1059
01:13:15,470 --> 01:13:16,560
救命啊
Help!

1060
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,930
别动 保持冷静 想想夏洛特
You stay down. You stay calm. Think of Charlotte!

1061
01:13:23,730 --> 01:13:24,810
让我和他一起去
Let me go with him.

1062
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:25,900
让我和他一起去
Let me go with him!

1063
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:27,480
我们想进去 我们想帮忙
We wanna go in! We wanna help!

1064
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:28,570
我肯定你会的
I bet you do.

1065
01:13:30,190 --> 01:13:31,780
冥界警局的败类们
Ripd scum.

1066
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:34,530
嘿 贞 好久不见了
Hey, Joan, been a long time.

1067
01:13:35,530 --> 01:13:37,660
你这把著名的剑还在
Still got this famous blade of yours.

1068
01:13:38,910 --> 01:13:43,040
作为前冥界警局 我可以告诉你这两个人的真实面貌
As ex-ripd, I can tell you what these two really look like.

1069
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:47,210
我可以看到他们
I can see them.

1070
01:13:50,420 --> 01:13:52,880
我可以看到一切
I can see everything.

1071
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:56,010
我可以这么讲 对你们和你们的警局来说
And I can tell you it's too late for you

1072
01:13:56,090 --> 01:13:58,100
恐怕已经太晚了
and your department, I'm afraid.

1073
01:13:58,970 --> 01:14:03,060
明天你们的冥界警局将对我们的数字毫无用处
Tomorrow your ripd will be useless against our numbers.

1074
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:08,320
当门户大开时 死人将会接管
When the gateway opens wide, deados will take over.

1075
01:14:09,110 --> 01:14:11,820
当我把地球变成第十层地狱的时候
And I'm gonna rule over them all as I turn earth

1076
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:15,910
我会统治他们
into the tenth circle of hell.

1077
01:14:19,740 --> 01:14:21,700
就在黎明前 把他们带进来
Just before dawn, bring them in so that

1078
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:23,370
以便我可以在门户再次关闭之前
I can throw them into the abyss

1079
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:26,120
把他们扔进深渊
before the gateway closes once again.

1080
01:14:34,590 --> 01:14:37,680
而对于像你们这样的厌火者来说
And for someone who hates fire as much as you,

1081
01:14:38,470 --> 01:14:39,760
贞德·达克
Jeanne d'Arc,

1082
01:14:40,430 --> 01:14:42,810
会永远沐浴在火中
you'll be bathing in it for all eternity.

1083
01:14:48,230 --> 01:14:52,690
讽刺是如此的美味
The irony is so gloriously delicious.

1084
01:14:55,990 --> 01:14:57,910
不要让他们离开你的视线
Do not let them out of your sight.

1085
01:15:07,790 --> 01:15:10,380
贞德·达克
Jeanne d'Arc? Joan?

1086
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:12,670
死了445年
445 years dead?

1087
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:15,090
我思维相当敏捷 我想到了
I think pretty quick on my feet. I figured it out.

1088
01:15:15,170 --> 01:15:17,090
-你是... -圣女贞德
-You're... - Joan ofarc.

1089
01:15:19,010 --> 01:15:20,010
贞
Joan.

1090
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:23,560
如果你不介意 我就一直叫你为贞
If it's all right with you, I'm just gonna keep calling you Jean.

1091
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:26,100
-贞德 -贞 贞德 都一样
- Jeanne. - Jean, Jeanne, same thing.

1092
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:30,860
圣女贞德 独行侠真正需要的第一搭档
Joan ofarc, first partner this lone wolf has ever really needed.

1093
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:35,150
我很高兴有你作为我的第四个搭档
And I've enjoyed having you as my fourth partner.

1094
01:15:36,650 --> 01:15:37,650
罗伊·塞弗斯
Roycephus.

1095
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:40,950
希望其他三个人真的和我们在一起
Well, let's hope those other three are really with us,

1096
01:15:41,030 --> 01:15:42,990
因为我们需要所有的帮助
'cause we're gonna need all the help we can muster

1097
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:44,160
才能离开这个鬼地方
to get the hell out of here.

1098
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:53,170
用力挖
Harder. Dig harder.

1099
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:58,840
把他拉起来
Get him up.

1100
01:15:58,970 --> 01:16:01,720
-起来吧  -不 不 求你了 我能帮上忙
- Get up. - No, no, no. Please, I can help.

1101
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,810
-来吧 -回去工作
- Come on. - Back to work!

1102
01:16:24,990 --> 01:16:27,290
我现在可以感觉到了
I can feel it now.

1103
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:32,420
倒数三...
In three...

1104
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:34,130
二...
Two...

1105
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:36,960
一
One.

1106
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:41,110
所以 如果他们能打开门户
So if they can get this gateway open,

1107
01:17:41,190 --> 01:17:43,490
有没有什么东西可以关闭门户
is there anything that can close it?

1108
01:17:43,570 --> 01:17:47,530
有的 但我们需要扑灭地狱之火
Yes. Butwe'll need to extinguish the hellfire.

1109
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:50,250
只有一个办法可以做到
Only one thing can do that.

1110
01:17:50,910 --> 01:17:53,710
在奥尔良围攻战中 当我还活着的时候
During the siege of Orleans, when I was alive,

1111
01:17:54,710 --> 01:17:58,040
我评估了对我们上帝之家造成的损失…
I broke ranks to assess the damage done to our houses of god...

1112
01:17:58,710 --> 01:18:00,880
上帝啊 请怜悯他们的灵魂
God, have mercy on their souls.

1113
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:06,590
我发现了真正宏伟的东西
I discovered something truly magnificent.

1114
01:18:10,270 --> 01:18:12,230
基督的眼泪
The tears of Christ.

1115
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:16,020
嘿 你们好 派对上还能再多加一位吗
Hey, y'all. Room for one more at this party?

1116
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:19,020
看看这只猫拖来了什么
Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in.

1117
01:18:19,110 --> 01:18:20,530
没想到我们会再见
Didn't think we'd see you again.

1118
01:18:20,610 --> 01:18:22,650
闭嘴 库珀 你话太多了
Shut up, Cooper. You talk too much.

1119
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:27,660
作为“罗塞伊”的感觉如何
Mm. How does it feel being on the "royceiphing" end?

1120
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:30,660
噢 那是她的 是不是
Oh, that's hers, ain't it?

1121
01:18:31,450 --> 01:18:32,870
是的
Yeah.

1122
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:35,080
好大
It's big.

1123
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:39,250
别紧张
Take it easy.

1124
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:41,170
在她那样对待我之后
Not after the way she's treated me.

1125
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:42,880
这不是为她安排的
This is not what's planned for her.

1126
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:44,670
你不会想违背命令的
You don't wanna go against orders.

1127
01:18:46,930 --> 01:18:48,300
好吧 那她呢
Well, how about her, then?

1128
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:50,470
我真的很想开枪打人
Ireahyfeelhke shooting somebody.

1129
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:52,020
我明白了
I get that.

1130
01:18:52,810 --> 01:18:54,140
噢 是吗
Oh, you do?

1131
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:55,810
那太好了
Well, that's great!

1132
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:24,840
那么 现在相信我了吗
Well, do you trust me now?

1133
01:19:27,010 --> 01:19:28,260
所以在我放你们出来之前
So before I let you out,

1134
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:31,260
希望你们能答应我 我的灵魂能够得到重审
I want you to promise me, my soul gets a retrial.

1135
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:33,470
希望我现在的判决被撤销
I want my current judgement revoked.

1136
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:37,020
很难得 但并非不可能
That's rare, but not impossible.

1137
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:39,770
你放我们出去 我会看着办的
You let us out, and I'll see to it.

1138
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:43,820
还有你
And you.

1139
01:19:45,610 --> 01:19:47,610
在我放你们出来之前 你需要看看这个
Before I let you out, you need to see this.

1140
01:19:49,610 --> 01:19:51,700
请记住 巴特菲尔德拥有一家印刷厂
Remember, butterfield owns a printing press,

1141
01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:53,280
就像我所说的 我是被陷害的
and like I said, I was framed.

1142
01:19:53,830 --> 01:19:55,450
我说过 这些纸不是官方的
I told you the bills weren't official.

1143
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:57,250
巴特菲尔德让他们做了假的
Butterfield had them fake ones made.

1144
01:19:57,710 --> 01:20:00,420
是你跟他之间的争议 而不是我 罗伊·塞弗斯
Your beef is with him, not me, roycephus.

1145
01:20:02,590 --> 01:20:03,590
叫我罗伊
Call me Roy.

1146
01:20:23,190 --> 01:20:25,470
听我说 我们得设法离开
All right, listen to me. We gotta try and get out of here.

1147
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:28,280
-我们必须马上离开 -不
- We gotta get out right now! - No!

1148
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:30,450
爸爸 不
Daddy! No!

1149
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:33,200
求你们了...
Please...

1150
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:41,830
他走了 他被带走了 看着我
He's gone! He's been taken! Look at me!

1151
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,840
你爸爸走了 我们得走了
Your daddy's gone. We have to go!

1152
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:51,800
这些眼泪需要被丢进地狱火之眼
These tears need to be dropped into the eye of the hellfire,

1153
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:53,140
在门户的正中央
dead center in the gateway.

1154
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:55,430
只有这样才会封门 把一切都吸进去
Only then will it seal, sucking everything in with it.

1155
01:20:55,510 --> 01:20:57,150
意味着我们必须先把那些人类弄出来
Means we gotta get those humans out first.

1156
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,600
正是如此
Exactly.

1157
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:00,560
现在走吧
Now go.

1158
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:02,480
你也一起去
Uh, you're coming with.

1159
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:05,110
我不能 罗伊 我… 我只是不能
Ican't, Roy. I... I just can't.

1160
01:21:06,150 --> 01:21:07,320
走吧
Go! Go!

1161
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:13,990
和我待在一起 你会出去的 留在我身边儿
Just stay with me. You'll get out. Just stay with me.

1162
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,590
我明白了
Come on! I think I get it!

1163
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:30,590
不要看他们
Don't look at them!

1164
01:21:30,670 --> 01:21:32,680
转移你们的视线
Avert your eyes!

1165
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:34,220
转移你们的视线
Avert your eyes!

1166
01:21:35,470 --> 01:21:38,490
你身上有火 比从地狱里冒出来的任何东西都要大
You've got fire in you that's greater than anything that ever came out of hell.

1167
01:21:38,510 --> 01:21:40,100
你有这个能力 来吧 就现在
You got this. Come on, now!

1168
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:42,350
自从我在火刑柱上被烧死之后
Not a moment has passed since I was burned at the stake

1169
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:44,560
我没有一刻不听到自己临死前的尖叫声
that I have not heard my own dying screams.

1170
01:21:46,650 --> 01:21:47,860
我对付不了火 罗伊
I can't do fire, Roy.

1171
01:21:48,730 --> 01:21:49,730
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1172
01:21:50,150 --> 01:21:51,190
带我进去
Bring me in.

1173
01:21:54,530 --> 01:21:55,570
嘿 搭档
Hey, partner.

1174
01:21:56,320 --> 01:22:00,080
你保护了这些东西445年了
You've been safeguarding these for 445 years.

1175
01:22:00,830 --> 01:22:02,160
现在是你的时刻
This is your moment.

1176
01:22:10,090 --> 01:22:12,720
让他们睁开眼睛
Make them open their eyes!

1177
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:18,640
让他们看看
Make them look!

1178
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:29,900
我没有呼唤他们
I didn't call forthem.

1179
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:31,610
别无选择 另一个反叛了
No choice, the other one rebelled.

1180
01:22:31,690 --> 01:22:33,690
在我抓住她之前就干掉了库珀和布鲁克斯
Took out Cooper and Brooks before I got her.

1181
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:34,960
我该怎么对付他
What should I do with this one?

1182
01:22:34,990 --> 01:22:36,110
把他扔进去
Just throw him in!

1183
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:44,620
准备好了吗
Ready?

1184
01:22:44,710 --> 01:22:45,710
好了
Set.

1185
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,430
这边儿走 来吧
This way. Come on.

1186
01:23:03,890 --> 01:23:04,890
来吧
Come on.

1187
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:12,610
去帮助安格斯和其他人 我要去找奥蒂斯
Go help Angus and the others. I'm gonna find me this Otis.

1188
01:23:12,690 --> 01:23:13,690
好的
Okay.

1189
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:15,860
闭眼 闭眼
Close your eyes! Close your eyes!

1190
01:23:15,950 --> 01:23:16,990
快点儿 快点儿 快点儿
Come on, come on, come on!

1191
01:23:17,030 --> 01:23:18,410
保持眼睛闭上 动起来
Keep your eyes closed! Go! Move!

1192
01:23:19,030 --> 01:23:20,030
走 快走
Go! Go!

1193
01:23:20,530 --> 01:23:21,530
小心 不
Watch out! No!

1194
01:23:27,170 --> 01:23:28,670
走 快点儿
Let's go! Come on!

1195
01:24:06,830 --> 01:24:08,540
我明白了 可以
I get it. It's hot.

1196
01:24:08,830 --> 01:24:10,370
会更可以
It's gonna get a whole lot hotter.

1197
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:13,960
求你了
Please. Please.

1198
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:15,340
不 不 不 不...
No, no, no, no...

1199
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:24,180
快离开 走
Get out of here. Go!

1200
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:38,740
闭眼
Keep your eyes closed!

1201
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:39,820
闭眼
Keep your eyes closed!

1202
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:41,360
快点儿 走
Come on! Go!

1203
01:24:41,490 --> 01:24:42,820
去吧 感觉一下
Go! Feel!

1204
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:36,090
我们要坚持住
We need to hold on.

1205
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,070
坚持住
Hold on!

1206
01:26:25,090 --> 01:26:26,510
嘿 结束了
Hey, it's over.

1207
01:26:26,590 --> 01:26:27,640
结束了
It's over.

1208
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:33,930
那眼泪真有力量
That's some powerful tears you got there.

1209
01:26:34,890 --> 01:26:37,940
那些可怜的人去了属于他们的地方
And the wretched are where they belong.

1210
01:26:39,270 --> 01:26:41,070
奥蒂斯 从表面看 也是如此
And Otis, too, from the looks of it.

1211
01:26:45,910 --> 01:26:48,120
谢谢你的及时出现
Thanks for showing up when you did.

1212
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:49,910
你没有给我太多选择
You didn't give me much choice.

1213
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:53,700
请帮我一下
Little help, please.

1214
01:26:56,460 --> 01:26:57,460
来了
Come on.

1215
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:03,630
噢 这真的是
Oh, it's really in there.

1216
01:27:03,710 --> 01:27:05,910
就像大地被紧紧拉住了
Yes, it's like the earth is tightened around it.

1217
01:27:06,260 --> 01:27:10,390
你们的介入 真的是在考验我的耐心
Your interference is really testing my Patience.

1218
01:27:28,780 --> 01:27:32,580
看来我还得再等25年
Appears I'll have to wait another 25 years

1219
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:34,080
才能有这个机会
for this opportunity.

1220
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:35,500
阿斯塔罗特
Astaroth!

1221
01:27:35,870 --> 01:27:38,580
阿斯… 什么 什么是阿斯塔罗特
As... what? What's an astaroth?

1222
01:27:40,170 --> 01:27:41,920
邪恶三位一体的三分之一
One-third of the evil Trinity.

1223
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:44,960
魔鬼的右手
The right hand to the devil himself.

1224
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:48,930
直到我在地球上建立自己的王位
Until I Rose to establish my own throne here on earth.

1225
01:27:49,010 --> 01:27:51,430
这次你们阻止不了我了
And you're not gonna stop me this time!

1226
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:07,950
我搞丢了眼泪 罗伊
I've lost the tears, Roy.

1227
01:28:13,530 --> 01:28:14,990
我得去拿剑
I've got to get to my sword.

1228
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:19,120
等一下
Hold on, now.

1229
01:28:20,170 --> 01:28:21,710
看看留下了什么
Look what got left behind.

1230
01:28:26,670 --> 01:28:28,220
放松点 有我在
Relax. I got this.

1231
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:30,630
嘿 混蛋罗斯
Hey, asshole-roth!

1232
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:42,290
没有什么比让你们的灵魂被自己的武器
Nothing more humiliating than having your soul taken

1233
01:29:42,370 --> 01:29:44,960
带走更丢人的了
by your own weapon, huh?

1234
01:29:49,590 --> 01:29:51,010
眼泪
The tears.

1235
01:29:51,090 --> 01:29:53,220
我们有东西忘了
Let there be something left.

1236
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:36,300
放心吧 安妮·奥克利
Eat your heart out, Annie oakley.

1237
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:11,840
我很肯定巴特菲尔德不希望我们清帐
I'm quite sure butterfield does not expect us to settle our tab.

1238
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:15,380
是的 但我们有未完的事儿
No, but we got some unfinished business.

1239
01:31:17,470 --> 01:31:19,140
我从未想过要杀警长
I never meant to kill that sheriff!

1240
01:31:19,220 --> 01:31:20,220
-走 -求你们了
-Let's go. - Please.

1241
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:21,430
你们一定要相信我
You got to believe me.

1242
01:31:21,510 --> 01:31:23,350
我发现他蜷缩在床底下
I found him cowering under the bed.

1243
01:31:23,430 --> 01:31:25,060
去吧 告诉他真相
Go on, tell him the truth!

1244
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:29,270
当奥蒂斯占领了我的小镇时
When Otis took over my town,

1245
01:31:29,860 --> 01:31:31,520
我试图逃跑
I tried to escape.

1246
01:31:31,610 --> 01:31:33,820
我搭上了穿越边境的火车
Caught me a train across the border.

1247
01:31:33,900 --> 01:31:35,780
碰巧的是 那些萨缪尔强盗
Just so it happened, them Samuel bandits

1248
01:31:35,860 --> 01:31:37,950
同时在马蹄镇上工作
were working over horseshoe at the same time,

1249
01:31:38,030 --> 01:31:40,950
在火车经过的时候 为奥蒂斯偷来了更多的人
stealing more folks for Otis as the train passed through.

1250
01:31:41,030 --> 01:31:43,370
我不想让那些萨缪尔把我带回去
I didn't want them Samuels bringing me back.

1251
01:31:45,330 --> 01:31:47,080
所以 当我开枪的时候…
So, when I fired that gun...

1252
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:49,420
我以为我是在射杀他们中的一个
I thought I was shooting one of them.

1253
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:50,880
巴特菲尔德
Butterfield!

1254
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:53,460
不 不 过来
No. No, come here.

1255
01:31:54,090 --> 01:31:55,170
快点儿
Go on!

1256
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:57,420
我知道他在那里
I knew he was there.

1257
01:31:57,510 --> 01:31:59,970
我知道他是最弱的
I knew he was the weakest.

1258
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:03,970
我让人印了假传单 以保住我自己的面子
I had them fake bills printed in order to save my own hide.

1259
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:07,480
你们女人为什么这么关心那个该死的警长
Why do you women even care so much about that damn sheriff?

1260
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:11,060
我知道马库斯·奥雷利乌斯对复仇的看法
I know what Marcus aurelius thinks about revenge.

1261
01:32:11,150 --> 01:32:13,440
但《圣经》是怎么说的 而且要快
But what does the Bible say, and make it quick?

1262
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:17,990
罗伊 如果我开始引用《圣经》 巴特菲尔德会老死的
Roy, if I start quoting the Bible, butterfield will die of old age.

1263
01:32:18,490 --> 01:32:21,160
你知道该怎么办
You know what to do.

1264
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:29,160
我听说你们昨晚失去了执法者
I heard that you lost your lawman up there last night.

1265
01:32:29,250 --> 01:32:32,920
你们或镇上有没有人想选为新警长
Is there anyone that you or the town wanna elect as new sheriff?

1266
01:32:33,540 --> 01:32:34,880
有的 这里就有
Yes, there is.

1267
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:37,340
他
Him.

1268
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:38,920
-我吗 -他
- Me? - Him?

1269
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:41,430
而我会成为他的副手
And I'm going to be his deputy.

1270
01:32:43,180 --> 01:32:44,300
好吧
All right, then.

1271
01:32:45,810 --> 01:32:48,310
你们亲眼看到了你们的下场
You saw firsthand where you're gonna end up.

1272
01:32:48,390 --> 01:32:51,100
没有什么比这更糟糕的了
There ain't nothing worse that I can to you than that.

1273
01:32:51,190 --> 01:32:53,520
把他带走 把他关起来
Take him away. Lock him up.

1274
01:32:53,610 --> 01:32:54,900
副警长
Deputy.

1275
01:32:57,320 --> 01:32:58,610
我们走吧
Let's go!

1276
01:32:58,690 --> 01:33:00,490
朱利叶斯
Julius. Ah!

1277
01:33:01,410 --> 01:33:03,240
-释放我 -亡命人
- Release me! - Deado outlaw

1278
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:06,290
单挑亡命人 你走了很长的路 孩子
To deado lawman. You've come a long way, son.

1279
01:33:07,790 --> 01:33:10,580
我想你赢得了权利 让我们知道你的真实身份
I guess you've earned the right for us to know who you really are.

1280
01:33:10,660 --> 01:33:12,120
我们该叫你大黄蜂吗
Should we call you bumble?

1281
01:33:13,630 --> 01:33:16,000
不 继续叫我史莱姆就好了
No. Keep calling me slim.

1282
01:33:16,090 --> 01:33:18,510
我打算只给这个名字带来荣誉
I intend on bringing only honor to the name.

1283
01:33:18,590 --> 01:33:21,720
当你的灵魂重审确定后 我们会去找你的
We'll come get you when your soul's retrial has been set.

1284
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:23,340
但如果你越界了
But you step out of line here,

1285
01:33:23,430 --> 01:33:25,550
我们就会以完全不同的理由回来
and we'll be coming back for a whole different reason.

1286
01:33:26,260 --> 01:33:27,720
收到 罗伊·赛普
Message Roy-ceiphed.

1287
01:33:36,270 --> 01:33:40,900
我想我们的女士们需要去买几件衣服了
I guess us ladies need to go shopping for a couple of dresses.

1288
01:33:40,990 --> 01:33:41,990
因为...
Because...

1289
01:33:44,950 --> 01:33:48,080
我们不能像这样去参加我女儿的婚礼
We cannot go to my daughter's wedding looking like this!

1290
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:53,000
不管那是什么意思
Yeah, whatever that means!

1291
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:55,790
意思是“哦 我的天哪”
It means, "oh, my god!"

1292
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:04,510
女士们先生们 容我向你们介绍帕克先生和他的太太
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you Mr. and Mrs. Parker!

1293
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:08,100

01:34:09,390 --> 01:34:10,720
谢谢
Thank you.

1296
01:34:10,810 --> 01:34:12,350
他们来了 快点儿
There they are. Come on.

1297
01:34:12,430 --> 01:34:14,060
稍等 快点儿 快点儿
One second, one second. Come on, come on.

1298
01:34:14,850 --> 01:34:16,150
现在好了
Well, now.

1299
01:34:16,230 --> 01:34:18,770
你们俩看起来真的很漂亮
Don't you two look simply magnificent?

1300
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:23,400
祝你们好运 安格斯 今天过后你会面临比地狱更大的挑战
Good luck, Angus. After today you'll face a far greater challenge than hell.

1301
01:34:23,490 --> 01:34:24,700
婚姻
Marriage.

1302
01:34:24,780 --> 01:34:26,620
而且你会喜欢其中的每一秒钟
And you're gonna love every second of it.

1303
01:34:28,370 --> 01:34:29,660
你还好吗 梅布尔
Are you okay, Mabel?

1304
01:34:29,740 --> 01:34:31,820
因为你刚才说的我一个字都听不懂
'Cause I didn't understand a word that you just said.

1305
01:34:35,870 --> 01:34:40,500
我想我姐妹一定是舌头被烫伤了
I think my sister must have burned her tongue up there.

1306
01:34:40,590 --> 01:34:43,880
她说她简直太为你们高兴了
She said she couldn't be happier

1307
01:34:43,970 --> 01:34:47,390
多么漂亮的一对
for you and your beautiful wife.

1308
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:26,170
我知道我才刚认识她
I know I just met her,

1309
01:35:26,260 --> 01:35:29,050
但感觉就像我认识了梅布尔一辈子
but it feels like I've known Mabel my whole life.

1310
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:30,430
我知道
I know.

1311
01:35:31,390 --> 01:35:32,930
她非常...
She is very...

1312
01:35:33,020 --> 01:35:34,470
超凡脱俗
Otherworldly.

1313
01:35:40,270 --> 01:35:43,230
那么告诉我 为什么安格斯现在不能理解我
So tell me why Angus can't understand me now.

1314
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:46,610
因为现在你同意了你女儿的婚姻
Because now that you've approved of your daughter's marriage,

1315
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:51,950
你的灵魂觉得安格斯是亲人
your soul considers Angus a loved one.

1316
01:35:54,620 --> 01:35:58,620
那么 我们要怎么处理这些马呢
So, uh, what are we gonna do with these here horses?

1317
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:00,580
让它们去吧
Let them go.

1318
01:36:00,670 --> 01:36:02,960
只要我们需要 它们就会在这里等着我们
They'll be here for us whenever we need them.

1319
01:36:10,260 --> 01:36:13,010
你知道 我一直在想 我明白了
You know, I've been thinking, I get it.

1320
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:15,970
你的余生都是冥界警局的人
You're ripd for the rest of your afterlife.

1321
01:36:16,060 --> 01:36:18,690
责任 荣誉 奴役和所有这些
Duty, honor, servitude and all that.

1322
01:36:19,190 --> 01:36:23,650
但秘密仅限于你我之间  还有那根栅栏 我估计我完事儿了
But between you and me and the fencepost, I reckon' I'm done.

1323
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:27,570
一旦我们结束了这段糟糕的旅程
As soon as we're done with this shitty ride here,

1324
01:36:27,650 --> 01:36:30,990
我就会告诉哈诺打开门户
I'm gonna tell hano to open up that portal

1325
01:36:31,070 --> 01:36:34,530
把我引向永恒荣耀的甜蜜温暖
point me towards the sweet warmth of eternal glory,

1326
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:36,790
然后送我上路
and send me on my way.

1327
01:36:39,250 --> 01:36:41,000
我想让你知道
I want you to know,

1328
01:36:41,080 --> 01:36:44,590
我真的很高兴能和你在冥界警局一起共事
I'm real glad to have served with you and the ripd,

1329
01:36:46,170 --> 01:36:47,340
搭档
partner

1330
01:36:55,720 --> 01:36:59,480
什么... 有什么好笑的
What... what's funny?

1331
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:02,020
你没有读过合同吗
You didn't read your contract, did you?

1332
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:04,230
见鬼 当然没有 那东西比史莱姆还厚
Hell, no. That thing was thickerthan slim.

1333
01:37:04,310 --> 01:37:07,610
永恒的荣耀确实在等着你 罗伊
Well, eternal glory does await you, Roy,

1334
01:37:08,820 --> 01:37:13,410
但必须在你完成最低限度的100年合同期限之后
but only after you served your minimum 100-year contract term.

1335
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:16,660
100年吗
One hundred years?

1336
01:37:16,740 --> 01:37:20,540
你我关系还没结束 搭档
Looks like you and me aren't done with each other yet, partner.

1337
01:37:23,710 --> 01:37:24,710
来吧
Come on!

1338
01:37:34,510 --> 01:37:35,720
该死的
God damn it.

1339
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:37,640
抱歉 老大
Sorry, boss.

1340
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:40,350
我想说的是... 可恶
What I meant to say was... Damn it!
