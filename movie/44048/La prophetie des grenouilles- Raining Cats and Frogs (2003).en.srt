6
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,991
Grandpa!

7
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Mom, come on

8
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Mom, we will be late!

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Oh, where is grandpa?

10
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,991
In the toilet

11
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Grandpa, are you here?

12
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Grandpa, I know you are here

13
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Child, what do you want to do? We'll be late

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Don't call "grandpa" so many times

15
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I have told you.    Mom, he won't come

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Alright, come on, Ferdinand

17
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Why can't you let me be quiet?

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We must go to Lamotte, you promised

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Billimidi, you are right, I forget!

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Let's go, mom

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,993
We go first

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,991
Wait for me

23
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Tom, Juliette

24
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,993
Go up, we will be faster

25
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Run

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,991
Full speed!

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Hurry, grandpa! Do you know what time is it?

28
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Don't call "grandpa", call papa

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Papa! I can't, you are too old!

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,991
Little bastard

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm not your real father,
but I bring you up

32
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Now you are my son

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Don't be angry, grandpa, I love you

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I think so, too

35
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
He hates me calling him grandpa

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's normal, don't forget you are our son

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Do you call me grandma?   That's different, you are young

38
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Tom! What are you talking about?

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Do you hear what the little bastard said? Ferdinand

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,993
I hear nothing

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,993
The weather doesn't change, it's still sunny

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,993
In the following days,
it's not cloudy, nor windy

43
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The peasents worry about the low precipitation...

44
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Louise, you won't believe...

45
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,991
I've filled the gas

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,991
Am I great?

47
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Dear, promise me to be careful, understand?

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm so worried leaving you

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,993
They! They are coming!

50
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Hey Lili! Hey, Children

51
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Hurry up, they've gone

52
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Why should I trust you?
It's not my fault, Lili

53
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I will shout  You always do that

54
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Here you come! Great

55
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Is it here, Lini, where crocodile is missing?

56
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yes, I'm glad to talk with Louise

57
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,993
It's the first time he comes to Africa

58
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Will you see me there?
So many crocodiles...

59
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm too worried

60
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Oh, dear, it's alright

61
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
No, dear, it's alright

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,991
Lini, be careful in the crocodiles

63
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Unless you are bad to them

64
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's not so simple

65
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
My grandma saw a crocodile eat a whole giraffe

66
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The whole giraffe

67
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Don't say it, you scare me

68
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
We are alright, don't worry

69
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You look after Lili and beasts
How can I thank you?

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Whom you should worry about is yourself

71
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Come here

72
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Come on, dear

73
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Don't be afraid, Louise

74
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You can sleep at ease
I will look on her as my child

75
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You are really great

76
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Ok, let's go, Louise

77
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Thanks again, we owe you

78
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Alright, we are neighbours

79
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
We will look after all the things

80
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Goodbye, child

81
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Kiss, Lili

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Be docile, we'll be back soon

83
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Bye, mom

84
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Let's go, Louise

85
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Wash the behind of ears...

86
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Keep warm when sleeping

87
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,993
Bye, papa, bye, mom, drive carefully

88
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,991
Wait, wait

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Wait, bring this, Louise

90
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's convenient on the ship

91
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Don't know when it works
Thank you, Mr. Ferdinand

92
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,993
Africa, we are coming!

93
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,993
A speed boat that brings crocodile...

94
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,993
Old Lini is nervous

95
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
How did I say to them?

96
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Tell them our results

97
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You must go, meeting tomorrow evening

98
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,993
Ok, I'm leaving

99
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Don't be pinned  Whom do you think I am?

100
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Do you remember the results?

101
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I remember it clearly.  Even decimal part?

102
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yes, I remember the decimal

103
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,993
Then you tell us...

104
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You should go now, it's an important meeting

105
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Do you know where is it?

106
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
We know it's far away, but it's your
responsibility going there

107
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
We have no choice in such a meeting

108
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Are you sure of the results? Of course

109
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
We've done 20 times.  Sure

110
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,993
Oh, if we have no choice...

111
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,993
My grandma's soul!

112
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Soul of life!

113
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,993
Let milk out!

114
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,991
Seems no use

115
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Pour off like a water column, not drops!

116
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,993
I won't do it any more!

117
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,991
Grandpa

118
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
What are you doing?

119
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Repair the tube of tractor

120
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I have a nail. But I don't know where is it

121
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I used it this morning

122
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Look, it's a good patch

123
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Just a little glue, like new one

124
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,993
It's easy to use, ok

125
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Grandpa, you looks funny, so young

126
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Tom...

127
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Looks like ant

128
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,993
Lili, put it down, it's no use

129
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Don't fill any more! It will explode!

130
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
No, grandpa, you said it's good

131
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Although so¡­

132
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,991
I think it should be

133
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Let's see if it explode

134
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Grandpa, I may continue filling

135
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,993
Enough: "grandpa"

136
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,993
And we are not making balloon!

137
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You bring the eggs, ok?

138
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,993
For battercake...yeah, battercake!

139
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,993
I run faster than you!

140
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
What's it upside? Don't look

141
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,993
Grandpa said it's danger.  Dranger?   Yes...

142
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Lili. Are you crazy

143
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,993
Don't do that! Go down! you don't follow...

144
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
We will be scolded   Let it be

145
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I can't grasp it,  happy now?

146
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,993
Don't grasp any more!  Not funny     really?

147
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
blocked

148
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Children

149
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I myself see the eggs today?

150
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,993
We are coming, Juliette will go down soon

151
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
The pond of pine? 38

152
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
The pond of owl? 38, too

153
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
The pond of justice? 41

154
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
The cave of factory? 39

155
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
The pond of old Berthier? 40

156
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,991
The pond of snake?

157
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Rock valley? 41

158
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,993
The pond of the bridge of the nigoles? 40

159
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,993
Without doubt, these figures messure up

160
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Just small discrepancy

161
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,993
It will rain 40 days and 40 nights after plenilune

162
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That's tomorrow night!

163
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
The rain will pour down, water in the rivers rises

164
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Soon it will go up to the bank

165
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Then it will be the terrible flood

166
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Water continues to go up

167
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Do you hear?

168
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
That's another Niagara

169
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,991
My god

170
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Who wants the last egg cookie?
I eat enough

171
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Me, too

172
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
So do I, thank you, Juliette

173
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Can you play guitar for us?   Good idea

174
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Just like last time, let me digest first

175
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
No, now, grandpa!

176
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You will sleep later

177
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Grandpa!

178
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Play, Ferdinand

179
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
So they can sleep

180
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,993
You two want me to play for you?

181
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,993
Let me sing "old sea house" for you

182
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
We left Porto Rico

183
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
in the evening of Saint-Malo

184
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,991
There was 8 people in the ship

185
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Our leak tub

186
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,991
Tides up, tides down

187
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
What do we take?

188
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Barrels of  Rum and bags of Coco

189
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
We set off from San Diego

190
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,991
Straits is low and plain

191
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Do you hear?

192
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
They, they have no other way

193
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Damn

194
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
They are dying, like others

195
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
We can warn them

196
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,993
How can they trust us?
We are just frogs

197
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Look, Tom! Grandpa's enemy

198
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Who are they?

199
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Potato pesticide
Why does one ride on another?

200
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
They are making love.  Can't you see?

201
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,993
What's "make love"?
I'm not your sex abecedarian

202
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,993
Ask your mother, go, wait!

203
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,993
Brave!  My beetle

204
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I still have feeling, I'm not dead

205
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Do you wound?  No, I'm alright

206
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Well done.   What did you say?

207
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Well done,  I want to...

208
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Can you speak?  Are you surprised?

209
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,991
Yes, a bit

210
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Let's talk about something else.   Wait, little guy

211
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I have something important to tell you

212
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,993
I don't believe!   A speaking frog?

213
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Wait! Come back!

214
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I told you, it's no use

215
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Stop! Tom, don't be silly

216
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Come on, you will see it

217
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
They can speak, I heard them talking

218
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Poor Tom

219
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Speak, or she will regard me as cheater

220
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Ok, we speak, listen

221
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Do I cheat you?  No, they can speak

222
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Listen!

223
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It's nothing

224
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Catastrophe is coming

225
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,993
The following 40 days and nights

226
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Flood?   Yes, flood

227
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It's no difference for us, but you...

228
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
If you don't act fast, you all will die

229
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Die? We dp,  so do you and other people

230
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Flood will drown animals, forests and farms...

231
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It will drown all the city, the toppest mountain

232
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Is it drown the sky?

233
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Yes, drown the sky

234
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Everything drown
No time

235
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
What shall we do?

236
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Oh, I have no idea

237
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Can you help us?

238
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Sorry, we can't, we are just frogs

239
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But we can forecast weather

240
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Hurry, I can't help you

241
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Now it's your problem

242
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,993
We must tell grandpa, come on, Tom!

243
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,993
Come on! Don't hide here

244
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,991
Grandpa!

245
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,993
Mom! Juliette

246
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,993
You are safe!

247
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
We succeed!

248
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,993
Anger of heaven quiets down

249
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,993
I don't know you, but¡­

250
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
You said!

251
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
When shall we eat?  I'm hungry

252
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
40 days isn't long, who believes it, captain?

253
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Roger that! We look after you

254
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Don't expect any miracle

255
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
But things on the tub can help us get through it

256
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Let's wait for it, stand aside!

257
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,991
Be careful!

258
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,991
How is it?

259
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,993
28 tons of potato!

260
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,993
Potato! Potato!

261
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Incredible, we are saved

262
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
in such a tub

263
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,993
Can we eat the potato the old man mentioned?

264
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Of course, I like it most

265
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
But I'm so hungry that I can eat a brick now

266
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,993
If you say so

267
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,991
Ah,  nausea!

268
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
You should make it cooked! You cooked it and then eat?

269
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Which cave do you dig?

270
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
If someone ask, you don't know

271
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Ok, Ok, ok, lumme

272
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,993
Do you see the two bacons behind us?

273
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,991
Am looking

274
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I'm thinking what will they react to it

275
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,993
We certainly should pay attention to them

276
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Excuse me, captain

277
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,993
Herbivore like potato, they are happy

278
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
But for us, carnivore, how could we eat potato?

279
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Is there anything for us on the menu?

280
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,993
I'm thinking about the problem.  Let me think

281
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Sheep are shivering in front of wolives

282
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
When cats prey, rats shiver

283
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Creeping animals like to eat hoptoads

284
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,991
They live together

285
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,991
It's not easy

286
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Everything must be changed
Or our lives will be deteriorated

287
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
If you don't oppress your aspirations
then we no longer exist

288
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
We can't survive

289
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,993
If you don't oppress your aspirations

290
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
For carnivore, it's natural

291
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,991
To eat Herbivore

292
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
It's standard rule

293
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
If you deny, you are madman

294
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Before the flood

295
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
It's unblamable

296
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
But now everything must be changed
Or lives will die out

297
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
We can't survive

298
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Wait, captain!

299
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
You mean we can't eat meat?

300
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Nor a piece of chicken?

301
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Nor a piece of chicken!

302
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,993
I know potatoes are difficult for you,
but it's the only way

303
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
We all need to survive

304
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Be patient

305
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,993
Blood won't last long

306
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
We are the only survivers,
just like Noah's Ark?

307
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I'm not clear, I can't see anything else

308
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
If nobody remains on the earth,
whom will you marry with?

309
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I won't tell you even if I know the answer

310
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
You are so...

311
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,993
I know whom I will marry with

312
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
There is something strange there

313
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,993
Where? A black thing on the water

314
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
You are right

315
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
A wood or something

316
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
No, wait

317
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
chelonian! Are you sure?

318
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
A large chelonian!

319
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I go to tell grandpa!

320
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Hurry, she is in the wrong direction

321
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
What's up? She saw chelonian

322
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Grandpa! Tom! Hurry

323
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
She grasps the life buoy!

324
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I bet they will get it on the ship

325
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
What's up? You know!

326
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
You are allergic to chelonian, by the way

327
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Can't you move there?

328
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,993
It's fine there! How can I?

329
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
No space

330
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
If that's your opinion
I just explain it

331
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,993
Don't you see I'm blocked?
What a bad mood are you today!

332
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I'm sorry

333
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I think we are too late

334
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,993
Poor grandpa, is she really dead?

335
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Look¡­

336
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
She has no fim

337
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,993
Somebody attacked her

338
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Little chelonian, open your eyes

339
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,991
Open your eyes

340
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
She isn't dead, she is still alive

341
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
She is still alive

342
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,991
Stand aside

343
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Give her some fresh air

344
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Where am I? We save you
You are in our ship

345
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
What's matter with you?

346
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,991
Crocodile¡­

347
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,991
Everywhere

348
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I just left

349
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I'm too tired

350
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Can't you see she is hungry?

351
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Bring her something to eat, come on

352
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
You saved me

353
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,993
Let her stay alone
She need rest

354
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
When shall we find the continent, grandpa?

355
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
No one can tell

356
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,993
It takes some time to absorb the water

357
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I hate this.   So do I

358
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I can't wait the absorbability

359
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Can't you try some spells, Juliette?

360
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I like it, but never use it

361
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
A falling star, make a wish, Tom

362
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I know, I hope flood retreat earlier

363
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Idiot, it's no use when you say it out

364
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Where does falling star come from?

365
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
You know it, my child

366
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Space is not empty

367
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
There are many gravels and rocks

368
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
floating around the earth

369
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Some are large, others are small

370
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
They are called meteorite

371
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Sometimes

372
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
When the earth cross them

373
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Falling stars are very fast

374
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,993
They rush to the space, abrade and fire

375
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Just like a match

376
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
So they radiate?  Smart child...

377
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
No, these falling stars have a secret

378
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,991
Billions years ago

379
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
When the first falling star cross the universe

380
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Arrive in our planet

381
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Some strange things happened

382
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Just like space is makeing love

383
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
with the earth

384
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
These maculas were produced

385
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,993
Bring us the first seed

386
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
That's how it begins

387
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
We are all offsprings of

388
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,991
the great falling star

389
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Are you feeling better?

390
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Yes, I come back

391
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
We shouldn't leave you alone like that

392
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
You are so kind, dear, how old are you?

393
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Me? I'm 9

394
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,991
And you?

395
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,993
You are very old, aren't you?

396
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Not too old

397
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
what are they talking about, mom? No¡­

398
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
They are talking about me

399
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,993
Don't be nervous, I will cut your ears

400
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Done

401
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,993
You can go now

402
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Don't look at these foxes

403
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Just look at him when he passes by

404
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,991
In low rock

405
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Whose claws is the strongest?

406
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
It's us, carnivore

407
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Who are the gangsters in the grouind?
The guys over there

408
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Calm down

409
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Who can provide it to you?

410
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,993
All the tigers and men

411
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Is it you, Tom? Yes

412
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Where is Lili? She has new friend

413
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
She doesn't play with me any more

414
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Sometimes, girls need a space for themselives

415
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,993
They need to talk about something we don't care about

416
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
My god! It's so small

417
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
The sky is low

418
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,991
Pass me the two-handed hammer.

419
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Here you are, Grandpa

420
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Thanks

421
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,993
Come in, ok?

422
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,993
Where, now still

423
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,993
Breakfast is ready, come and eat!

424
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,991
Potato again

425
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,991
Only potato

426
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Can I eat yours? Be my guest!

427
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Nor do you

428
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
What's the matter?

429
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
We all have potatoes

430
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Are you just wasting them?

431
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
You all do that, I can't believe it

432
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I just don't believe it

433
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I really don't believe it

434
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
As you know, after all, they are only carnivore¡­

435
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Carnivore maybe not

436
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
They do according to what we said
or we all eat

437
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Be happy, Lili  So are you

438
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,993
The potatoes are so delicioius

439
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
My ancestor¡­

440
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
What are she doing? Want to become a bakemeat

441
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,991
Spirit of the earth

442
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,993
Small potato¡­

443
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
She just cries    Is that bakemeat?

444
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Curse

445
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,991
Wrong again

446
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,993
I really don't know why    It never works

447
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I just have no power

448
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Usually it's so funny¡­

449
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
when your magic is wrong

450
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Don't laugh at me

451
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,993
It was useful at my grandma's time

452
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I feel your way of doing it

453
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I hate crocodile too

454
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
They kill all my family

455
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I'm the last surviver

456
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Look! That's what I remain

457
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Three small eggs

458
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I took them away

459
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Before the damned crocodile eat them

460
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,991
It's really a nightmare

461
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
These food make them mad

462
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Destroy all the movable things

463
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Even if there is human on the ship

464
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Really horrible, they are mad

465
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,993
Really incredible, I decide to go away

466
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Luckily, I find a life buoy

467
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
You know those news

468
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,993
Some people are still on the ship

469
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,993
My papa! My mom!

470
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
What's up?

471
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,991
I see

472
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I know your feeling

473
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,991
Cry

474
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Come on, cry , Lili

475
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Many people died of the flood

476
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Maybe we are just wandering surviver

477
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,993
But¡­ I think¡­

478
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Poor little thing, poor us

479
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I feel too bad

480
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Come on, come on¡­What have we become?

481
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Don't cry in front of the children

482
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,993
Come on, we talk about it in another place

483
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Louise¡­Lini¡­They are all kind people

484
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
What remains in our world?

485
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,993
What do we have, what will we dream of?

486
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Nothing! Nothing

487
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
You can't say that, the world won't end

488
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Just think for a while¡­

489
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
How long will our nightmare be?

490
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
1 year, 10 years, 100 years!

491
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
No one can tell it

492
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Time is lapsing

493
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
But I believe, one day

494
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
The flood will go away

495
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Flood goes away, then our lives restart

496
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Are you sure? No

497
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I can't ensure anything

498
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Yes, I can ensure one thing

499
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
That is: I love you forever

500
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,993
Our lives will never end

501
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,991
Roger?

502
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,991
Have you ever thought of...?

503
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Sometimes, in the morning

504
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
What do you think of?   Death, idiot!

505
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Death¡­

506
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Why do you want me to think now?

507
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Do you hear they said we are the only surviver

508
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,993
The only surviver?

509
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
What do you think it is after someone is dead?

510
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
After death?

511
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,993
How could I know?
What a question! I'm not soldier!

512
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,993
Make sure those things
Say, flood retreats¡­

513
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Flood retreats? It's over then!

514
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
What do you mean?

515
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
We are waiting

516
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
What can I say? Nothing!

517
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I just say, flood retreats

518
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
When you find something funny, tell me

519
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Isn't the flood retreat funny?

520
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Oh, my head¡­

521
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
When shall we go to

522
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
the same ship as the idiot stays?

523
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
What did I do?

524
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Is that a problem?  No,  I find out

525
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
You know,  my parents are dead, too

526
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,991
I was too young

527
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I think it was in a war

528
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I can't remember now

529
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,993
Anyway he adopted me

530
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I knew his parents
They were in the same ship as his father

531
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,993
So Juliette and I
decided to adopt the little sailor

532
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Will you adopt me?

533
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Do you remember we have promised to your
parents to look after you

534
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
we will keep the promise

535
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Will you keep the promise, too, Grandpa?

536
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I look after all the people who call me Grandpa

537
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
It's my honor

538
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Even if I hope these people don't call me like that

539
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,993
Ferdinand, seems your family is becoming larger

540
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I use the rear teeth to eat these potatoes

541
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
They burn like fires in my stomach

542
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I feel so terrible!

543
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Do you want your stomach to continue aching?

544
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,993
You will die without meat
There are many on the tub

545
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Nobody will miss one or two chick

546
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
No matter who are you, you forget one thing¡­

547
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
That's the rule of captain

548
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
We have no right
Who do you think are you?

549
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Can he change the natural law?

550
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
When do you see that carnivores don't eat meat?

551
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,991
Shut up!

552
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Pass me a piece of barbecue

553
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,993
Better half-cooked

554
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,993
Do you think can you?   Of course, see my great work

555
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Engine's power

556
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,991
will drive the shovels

557
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Then we can move!

558
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Am I smart?

559
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
At that time, it is a real ship! Real one

560
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
My papa is deft, too?

561
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
He is the high-class mechanician

562
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Compare with him, I'm an outsider

563
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I always see on the bridge

564
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
But he is already with engine

565
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
He is very familiar with his things

566
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
He can disassemble a engine in minutes

567
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Help!

568
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
What's the matter?

569
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Don't do that! Let me go!

570
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
What's the matter?

571
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
They want to eat her!

572
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Let her go right now!

573
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,000
My hoof, I can't beat them

574
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Ain't you mad? Ain't you crazy?

575
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,993
I really can't believe! You want to destroy each other?

576
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
No, captain
Do you know why, we are hungry!

577
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
We need meat, that's it

578
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Deepfry potato¡­We can't afford it

579
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Whatever.  Do you need pea to improve your intelligence?

580
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
We lived through relying on miracle

581
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Now you want to destroy anything!

582
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Want to destroy our chance of survival!

583
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Unless I'm dead!

584
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Enough!

585
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,993
We've got so many troubles
I will put you into prison¡­

586
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,991
In the tub

587
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Be careful of your leg, too

588
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I hate you! You are ruffians

589
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Selfish people

590
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Who let me lose it?
He should pay for it

591
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
They will rebel

592
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
The space is much larger now.  Are you dreaming?

593
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,993
I'm not dreaming
How could you say that?  Idiot

594
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I do say you are dreaming      How can?

595
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
My god! Don't speak, you make me nervous!

596
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Poor guy, you are scared

597
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
I never scare

598
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
The appearance of grandpa is in time.    Right

599
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I will lose my life if it's late

600
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,993
These bastards!  We need to be care of them

601
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Little goat, set your teeth

602
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Are you ok?   Yes

603
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,000
I'm more lucky than you
I've heard about your parents

604
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Yes, they are dead

605
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,993
Like others

606
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
When shall we attack?

607
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,993
Be careful! You can't badger with captain

608
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Let me get rid of him first

609
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Do you still remember what are we looking for?

610
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Of course

611
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,000
They are in the ship, I see them,   hide

612
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Hope so, others are angry

613
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
We can't stop them any longer

614
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Relax! We can't fall short of success for lack of a final effort

615
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Trust me, I have an idea

616
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,991
You go

617
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,993
I will inform you

618
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Damned bell! I never see such a monster!

619
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Who brings flashlight?

620
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,993
I can't see anything, why should I give it to him?

621
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Chelonian!

622
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Have you get in touch with crocodiles?

623
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Me? Are you crazy?

624
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
We saw you send them signal

625
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
You see nothing, but I see everything

626
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Captain leads crocodiles to here

627
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
I'm coming to warn you

628
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Do you want to know what did he say?

629
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Don't say

630
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Let him say

631
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
You know who is the chief instigator

632
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Of course!

633
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I believe this is what you hope

634
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
But now captain

635
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,000
wants to devote you to get peace

636
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
We shouldn't get carnivore any more
You make him sleepless

637
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I heard him say so   The old bastard!

638
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,993
Are you sure what are you saying?

639
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I swear, we carnivores must hold together

640
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Then what shall we do?

641
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
No other ways

642
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Who strikes first prevails

643
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,000
As long as we get rid of captain
you have chicks to eat

644
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
And babecue, crus
You won't be hungry any more!

645
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
We can win easily!

646
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
We can't live through it...

647
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
With the damned potatoes!

648
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,993
Right, guys?

649
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Enough, follow me!

650
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,991
This way

651
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,991
What¡­

652
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
What's the matter?

653
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
My god!

654
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Night attack!

655
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
As expected!

656
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Let me out, damn it

657
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Let me out!

658
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
You guys refuse to mend your ways despite of repeated admonition!

659
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Take off this thing!

660
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,993
Get it out of my head! You idiots!

661
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,993
Everything is peace, old guy!

662
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Juliette! Mom!

663
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Help!

664
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
We catch him!

665
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Lumme, I can't believe

666
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
All are here

667
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Lock them all! I will tell my Grandpa!

668
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
The old guy is not around now

669
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
What do you want?

670
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
His foolish ship, useless guitar...

671
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
And useless madness

672
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Old gaot! What happened to my parents?

673
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Do you really want to know? Yes, come on!

674
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
They went to hell

675
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
even without a goodbye!

676
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Loser!

677
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,993
It's our new captain

678
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Calamity is coming¡­     We are dead

679
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Don't worry, Lili, she will pay for it

680
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
That chelonian¡­

681
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
She said, even if I make friend with her

682
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
But she won't make friend with me

683
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I don't know how to do

684
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
I didn't think that she will bring so many trouble

685
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
It will be alright, Lili, who can know that in advance?

686
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,000
We must hold together now

687
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,993
Chick! What do they want to do?

688
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Chick¡­Chick¡­

689
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
They are epilating...

690
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,991
Epilate chick?

691
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I won't let this happen

692
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
We can't help, they are already crazy

693
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
We can't help?   It's easy to say

694
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
How could you do? You are just a child

695
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I will let you know who is child

696
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Let's go, Lili

697
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Be careful!

698
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
hum, guys?

699
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
How is the feeling of being dominator?

700
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Your troubles are over!

701
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
You can enjoy your lives!

702
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,993
Now you are the no. 1! No. 1!

703
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,993
Chick, braise it now

704
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
It will be delicious food after 5 minutes?

705
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Incredible!

706
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Our young friends run away

707
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
And are scared

708
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,000
No, we are not scared!
But you are an old witch!

709
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
What? Old witch!

710
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,993
Right! Say it again, slug

711
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
I hate these dirty things!

712
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
You can't do that! Can I!

713
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,991
Don't quarrel, baby

714
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
What happened over there?

715
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Don't have a finger in the pie

716
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Do you hear?

717
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
My wife and I want to know

718
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
What happened here?

719
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,000
If you don't shut up

720
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
The next one to braise is elephant nose!

721
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,991
I'm dead

722
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
It's really funny!

723
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Braise elephant nose¡­

724
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Chelonian soup is better!

725
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Don't speak, Roger, don't forget you are allergic

726
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,993
Friends, listen to me!

727
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
We ged rid of captain, well

728
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
His wife goes with him, very well

729
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
But¡­children are still here!

730
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,993
They are danger
You can't trust human

731
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
They will fight back one day

732
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Oh, what's your suggestion?

733
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Let's get rid of them, quickly

734
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,993
It's easy to say.  How to do?

735
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
No idea?

736
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
We can¡­   No!

737
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Continue, say it out

738
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
You mean, we can¡­

739
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
We can¡­

740
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Yes! Eat them

741
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Right

742
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Eat them! We can eat them

743
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Eat them!    Are you crazy?

744
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
We can't do that.   They are just children

745
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
You are really crazy

746
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,000
If cats don't agree, that's too bad
Wait¡­

747
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
We all can express his own opinion

748
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Let's vote.   Who is against?

749
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
No,  I really can't do that.   Don't let me do it

750
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,991
Please

751
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Only this?   What do we do it for?

752
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Me

753
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
The faster, the better

754
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
I agree with tortoise's opinion, it's too dangerous

755
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Or we all will regret

756
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Maybe it's wrong¡­

757
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
6 disagree, 1 agree

758
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Now it's clear

759
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Tomorrow morning¡­

760
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,991
Curtain

761
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Ferdinand, come back to me

762
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Don't let me sink

763
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,991
Wake up

764
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,993
Ferdinand! Open your eyes

765
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,991
I'm scared

766
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
What are you thinking? Frances

767
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Don't ask me! What's up?

768
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
It's terrible

769
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,000
They are right, we are carnivores

770
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Poor guy, you've forgot it

771
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Sausage skin, soup and Juliette's knee¡­

772
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
No, but we can't¡­

773
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
They bring you in, Bernard

774
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,000
We meet in their home and love each other there

775
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Isn't that meanless?

776
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Of course not

777
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,991
I never guess

778
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Do you know what do I bring?

779
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Do you assume they treat your cat like that, too?

780
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Yes¡­No¡­

781
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,991
You are right

782
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,993
For centuries, human has persecuted us

783
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
We tortoises

784
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,000
They hunt up our shell
our eggs, our body and meat

785
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Look, what remains in my arm?

786
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
We are cut bit by bit

787
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Day after day, then head¡­

788
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Before crabs and gnawer see bird eat us up¡­

789
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,000
We suffered for weeks like a live food wearhouse

790
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
All the family died

791
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,000
So that they can use our shell¡­

792
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,991
to make combs

793
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
We endure it silently

794
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
We don't say a word

795
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,000
We all shut up our mouths

796
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,000
But it's over

797
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Over

798
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,993
Flood makes my dream come true

799
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Listen to the curse:

800
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,991
Revenge

801
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
I will kill you all

802
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
All of you

803
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,000
With flashlight¡­

804
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Crocodile will come, too

805
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
No one will survive

806
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Perfect weapon

807
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,993
My small nuclear bomb

808
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,993
I'm really sorry about you

809
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
One more thing¡­

810
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Eggs

811
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
They are not mine

812
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,991
They are crocodiles'

813
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,000
They are crocodiles' last ones

814
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,000
These idiot can't lay eggs in the water

815
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,000
They need dry earth

816
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:29,000
The flood makes no dry earth

817
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
I stealed their last eggs

818
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,991
They will vanish forever

819
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,993
Only me, me

820
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Nothing can stop me

821
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,993
Nothing can stop me

822
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Uncover the thing on the mouth

823
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Red alert

824
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Crocodiles are coming

825
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Crocodiles

826
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Attack

827
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Here, my beauty

828
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,991
Here

829
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,991
Cheer up

830
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Crocodiles

831
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,991
Attack

832
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Guys, he is on the crocodiles side

833
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Damn it!  We are cheated

834
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Listen everyone

835
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
We have to think a way out

836
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
I will try to start the engine

837
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Start, Tom

838
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
The problem is¡­

839
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
I don't know how to do

840
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
They are coming

841
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Gete, it's bad

842
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Come on, they are coming

843
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Come on

844
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Lovely crocodiles, you have many delicious food

845
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,000
I have to lesson the tortoise

846
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
I will eat her

847
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,000
I don't know how to start it

848
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Thigh, ass meat and filet

849
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,000
And pig mouth¡­ Go in, dear

850
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
They catch up with us

851
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Godmother bless us

852
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,993
Start, the old rubbish

853
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Continue! Start

854
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,993
It turn to another direction

855
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,991
Shift

856
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
What are you doing?

857
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,000
We are now putting us into their mouthes

858
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Stop

859
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Retreat

860
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
We are advancing to them

861
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,991
Retreat, Tom

862
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
We are still not safe

863
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
They are still following us

864
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Accelerate, Tom

865
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,993
I've tried my best

866
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Still there?

867
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,993
I can't see,  I'm too scared

868
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Action

869
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,000
You will be feed for crocodiles

870
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,991
Go to hell

871
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
But what¡­

872
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,993
What's the matter with me?

873
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,000
You are here, Ferdinand!  You are back

874
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
You are here

875
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Hope Basti go to heaven!  What's that?

876
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
That's our barn!  Our ship

877
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,991
Attention

878
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,991
Here

879
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,991
Here

880
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,993
They are ramming toward us

881
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
I can't hold any more,  you are too heavy

882
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,993
What do you see downside?

883
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
They are behind us

884
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:35,000
I can't grasp it, the ship shakes too much

885
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,991
It will explode

886
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,993
It's bad.     We've found the reason

887
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Party is here

888
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Continue, crocodiles

889
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,993
Now they are all yours
It's they who steal your last eggs

890
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Your children, your offspring

891
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Falderal

892
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,993
You are here now, of course you will lie

893
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,991
To fool you

894
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Think a way out, she needs help

895
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,000
You know I'm allergic to tortoise

896
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
I can't believe

897
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:41,000
That's what you are worrying about?
Called pachyderm?

898
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,993
Ok!   obey you     If I have spots, don't complain

899
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Your eggs are all here
I can help you find them

900
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,993
But at first, eat up all the dogmeat in the ship

901
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,993
Let me go, you idiot! Let me go

902
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,991
my shell

903
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,993
He divests of my shell

904
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
He divests of tortoise's shell

905
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Murderer

906
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Murderer

907
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Give back my shell

908
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,000
What's that?  where do you get there eggs?

909
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,000
You are really crazy, they are mine

910
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
They are stolen from crocodiles'

911
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Nonsense!   They are my eggs

912
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,000
They come from my ovary

913
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
I'm the mother

914
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Don't you see?   She has penis

915
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
She is male

916
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,000
She cheats us!

917
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,993
Yes,  actually,  for tortoise¡­

918
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
male tortoises lay eggs

919
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Impossible.  Only female can lay eggs

920
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
that's girl's job

921
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,993
Think other things
Guy.   It's impossible

922
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,000
She just want to deal with us!   Wait

923
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,000
I can explain   Then explain

924
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Ok, female tortioses lay eggs

925
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,993
But my situation is¡­

926
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,991
Dregs

927
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Calm down¡­   Don't do that to me

928
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Control yourself    I can't

929
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,993
To be honest, I can't

930
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,991
My shell

931
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,000
What shall we do?
Cut his tongue and let him shut up

932
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,000
No, it's too simple      Now he must be punished

933
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Let those crocodiles eat him!

934
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Do you want him?

935
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
You bet we want!

936
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
wait! Let's cut him first

937
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,993
Cut him into pieces to make a soup!

938
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,991
Good idea!

939
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,993
Revenge!   Go to hell!

940
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Stop!

941
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Stop!   Everybody stop!

942
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Tom! Lili!

943
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Let me go there!  Are you ok?

944
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,993
Children¡­

945
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Do I meet a hero?

946
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Mom!

947
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,993
Are you ok?   Are you wounded?

948
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,993
I love you too much

949
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,993
Ok?  Shall we punish him now?  Punish him?

950
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,000
You mean, kill him?

951
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:01,000
How could we do others?
You are beyond redemption!

952
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Who gives you the power?

953
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Come on, tell me are you judge?

954
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Death penalty? Come on, explain to me!

955
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
They are right,  let it be

956
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Don't do that,  it's complicated enough

957
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,000
You idiots, look at yourselives

958
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,993
Your answers are just brutality and violence

959
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,000
What do you get from it?   A cut of slug?

960
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
you are nothing!

961
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,993
Captain, what do we want to say is¡­ sorry

962
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
We don't know what's wrong with us

963
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Your apology is the last thing I need

964
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Do you know who are you?   Yes

965
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Pilgarlic   You are weak!

966
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Consider it for yourself!

967
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,993
Look, how fool you are!
make all the things messy!

968
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Thanks god, nobody dies!

969
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Actually¡­

970
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
What?  Actually?

971
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,000
The chicken problem¡­

972
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Which problem? Which chicken?

973
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:13,000
We are very hungry¡­  I don't believe

974
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,993
I don't believe!   abhorrent!

975
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,000
You really bring the cookie
What else can I say?

976
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,000
What can I say?

977
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,993
I have nothing to say
I have nothing to say!

978
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,000
There are not many people on the ship

979
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Now we won't see hen, cock, chick and eggs any more

980
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Our chances of living become smaller and smaller

981
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Life is weak

982
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:48,000
We need each other
How can we let them believe this?

983
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,000
It's that chelonian, papa   she is evil

984
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
She actually is very evil

985
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,000
She feed crocodiles with us
She said it's revenge

986
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Nothing can prove revenge is right

987
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Seems they are crazy!

988
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,993
When you light up the fire of violence¡­

989
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
You never know how to extinguish it
He isn't wrong!

990
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,000
It's a worse thing
Thanks

991
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Don't forget this forever, children

992
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Do you see the trailer, papa?

993
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,000
I could drive it very well before
You are smart

994
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
I am also good without your help

995
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Let's talk romorrow morning
Go to sleep

996
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Good night, papa

997
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Papa¡­it's the second time

998
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Now you call me "papa"?

999
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,000
I must get used to it

1000
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Go, little baby

1001
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,991
papa!

1002
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,993
My lovely son

1003
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,000
When the sun rises from my sail

1004
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Morning wind blows on my face gently

1005
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Telling me a beautiful¡­

1006
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,993
tale of sea sailor

1007
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:17,000
If I have a son¡­

1008
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:21,000
A lovely boy
to cherish, that will be so good

1009
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,000
If I have a son¡­

1010
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
A child¡­

1011
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,991
who lives for love

1012
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,993
A child who lives for love

1013
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:45,000
we get along with each other, don't we, Lili?

1014
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,993
Yes, Tom
Whom will you marry with?

1015
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Guess

1016
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
I don't know, do I know her?

1017
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,993
Maybe¡­

1018
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,991
I don't want to now

1019
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Let's play "yes or no"

1020
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Yes   You lose

1021
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Why?   You said "yes"!

1022
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
No    You lose again!

1023
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,000
It's unfair   We haven't start yet

1024
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Lili

1025
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,993
Come on! Big cat is giving birth to little cat!

1026
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,000
It is actually the same as his father

1027
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,991
The same

1028
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,993
Classified by texure

1029
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Texture!

1030
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,000
These guys' head is abnormal

1031
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,991
He is still young

1032
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
What names shall we give them?

1033
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Children will name them

1034
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,991
I don't know either

1035
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Mistin Gady
I believe it's a girl's name

1036
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,000
He should be called Barcod

1037
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,000
I will teach him to fight

1038
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,993
The last one is Noah
We have no better choice

1039
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Shall we have a look?

1040
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
May I move over?

1041
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
What are you doing over there?

1042
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Nothing    We just want to see what happened

1043
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
How do you come in?

1044
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
From the sides

1045
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:21,000
We are always being forgot
after we landed, we think¡­

1046
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,000
land? From the sides?

1047
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Wait!   Stand aside!

1048
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Stand aside!

1049
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,000
He said stand aside!

1050
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,993
Damn it! It freezes!

1051
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,993
Anchor     We've arrived!

1052
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,993
we are saved!

1053
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Be quiet!

1054
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Shut up!

1055
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Be quiet!

1056
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,991
Sh!

1057
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,991
Listen¡­

1058
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Good evening everyone

1059
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:04,993
After 3000 miles of rushing about
Glad to see you

1060
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
And no water anywhere

1061
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,991
Mom, papa

1062
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,991
Sweetie

1063
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,000
My baby!  I thought you were dead

1064
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,993
dead?  We?  You can't kill Lamotte
We seems very strong

1065
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,000
You don't know how important he is to us

1066
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Don't do that  Now we are here

1067
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:33,000
What are we doing in here, peach?

1068
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,000
How are you?

1069
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,000
I thought I can't see you any more

1070
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:41,000
We are really lucky

1071
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Your father always want to do the shortcut

1072
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Lili, Louise! How you¡­

1073
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
My god, where have you been?

1074
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Anyway, we are back again

1075
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,000
How did you get through the flood?

1076
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Flood?   Which flood?

1077
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Do you want to fool me?

1078
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:03,000
We just pass the catastrophe, don't we?

1079
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Which catastrophe, Mr. Ferdinand?

1080
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:09,000
It rains all the time
The flood is very large, Louise¡­

1081
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Really absurd!

1082
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,993
They are joking with us!

1083
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,993
Don't joking with us
Let's drink, ok?

1084
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,993
Do you have france Pastis?
What are you waiting for?

1085
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,993
Old Lamotte doesn't change¡­

1086
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Do you see the time?
No, why do you ask that?

1087
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Past sleep time

1088
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
It's a special day today

1089
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Let's make a leading card

1090
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:18,000
2 hours past
Now it's midnight!

1091
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Midnight?    Oh?  It's the first time, Danis¡­

1092
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Will they kill us, won't they?

1093
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Sleep at ten,  we all agreed

1094
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Now you change your mind
You blow hot and cold everyday

1095
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,993
I'm not changing my mind, I just follow the intuition

1096
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Your intuition can't substitute for sleep

1097
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,993
Then go to sleep!  Only me alone?
Ain't you serious

1098
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,993
Then shut up

1099
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:52,000
We are happy

1100
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,000
You change your mind,  yes

1101
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Only fool doesn't change

1102
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Are you refering to me, Roger?
No, how could I refer to you

1103
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
I'm sure you are refering to me

1104
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,991
I'm absolutely not

1105
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Really?   Of course not¡­

1106
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Dear, in your mom's life

1107
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,000
I feel that you don't love me any more

1108
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Oh, why do you think so?

1109
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Tell me, you love me because you need me

1110
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Of course I do

1111
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Say, I never heard it    Don't do that¡­

1112
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,000
You know I do
No need to say that

1113
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Look, in another word, you don't love me

1114
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:38,000
What are you thinking about?

1115
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Ok, I love you

1116
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,993
Are you happy now?

1117
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:01,993
The End!
