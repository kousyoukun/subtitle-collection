1
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,120
- Oh, this is great!
- Wow!

2
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:55,040
Oh, that's incredible. There's
got to be seven or eight feet up there.

3
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,080
- And eighty years of dust.
- Oh, look at all this height.

4
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,090
We could put our bedroom upstairs,
and get all this space.

5
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,300
- For what?
- Just space.

6
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,970
One!

7
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,720
Two!

8
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,470
Three!

9
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,470
- And four?
- Come on.

10
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,230
And five?

11
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,820
- Watch, watch!
- God, this place is huge.

12
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,820
- It's beautiful.
- God!

13
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:34,410
- You guys, it's absolutely incredible.
- Incredible.

14
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:38,370
- A little paint.
- Sell it tomorrow, double your money.

15
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,040
Carl, you're obsessed.

16
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,670
A little bit.

17
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,460
Wow, look!

18
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,590
Hey, it's an lndian Head penny.

19
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,300
1 898.

20
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,720
It's a good omen.

21
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,890
You're the good omen.

22
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,690
Oh, it's so great!

23
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,120
I had Rose move your 3 o'lock
with Bob Kahan to 4 o'lock.

24
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:22,370
Gary Alan called. He has to see you
about the painting bids for the loft.

25
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,880
3 o'lock is the only time
he can make it. Is that OK?

26
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,630
Sam?

27
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,590
- I'm sorry.
- Relax, man.

28
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,050
You're not having brain surgery.

29
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,810
Pitching these Japanese guys
makes me so nervous.

30
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:43,230
Sam, you're going to be great. OK?

31
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:49,280
What am I supposed to say? I can't
really tell them my Swedish girl joke.

32
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,490
Great. Where did you get those?

33
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,990
Molly. What do you think?
Are they me?

34
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,120
- Oh, man. Look at that, a Testarossa.
- Wow...

35
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,960
- Ouch!
- Pay off your Mustang first.

36
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,970
How are you?
What did the doctor say?

37
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,180
He said that it was contagious.
That it was really...

38
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,930
- No?
- Yeah.

39
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,680
I shouldn't even be coming in today.

40
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,650
What about the rash?

41
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:26,940
The rash?

42
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,440
The rash is also incredibly contagious.

43
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,820
- He said they've both been spreading.
- No?

44
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,490
On your genitals again?

45
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,210
Yeah, yeah, right on the genitals.

46
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,960
Basically everywhere.
He said that I shouldn't touch anyone.

47
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,960
Excuse me, l'm sorry.

48
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,130
- You're sick!
- I know.

49
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,970
- Morning, Paul.
- Morning, Carl.

50
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,350
Save it, Paul.

51
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,850
- Morning, Mr Wheat.
- Susie. You're looking good.

52
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,890
- Sam.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

53
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,690
- Here it is.
- Thanks.

54
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,610
- Morning, Sam.
- Morning, Rose.

55
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,740
- Listen, the Kobiashi people...
- They're already here.

56
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,910
- They're early!
- I know.

57
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,410
- Come here!
- Andy Dillon called...

58
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,580
- How long have they been here?
- Ten minutes.

59
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:28,130
Andy Dillon called. He needs $900,000
transferred to Albany by ten.

60
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,210
- By ten?
- Yes.

61
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,010
- Carl?
- Yeah.

62
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,220
Carl...

63
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:42,720
Dillon needs 900,000 in Albany by ten.
Can you transfer it to his account?

64
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,890
- Yes, but I need your MAC code.
- OK.

65
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,030
- Discretion, right?
- Got it.

66
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,820
- You bet. I'll do it right now.
- Thanks.

67
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,820
Bill, l'll call you back.

68
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,290
OK, that's fine.

69
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,670
That's fine.

70
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,260
This is too far out.

71
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,720
Can you get this, man?

72
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,180
Are you guys from
the New York City Ballet?

73
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,560
Almost...

74
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,440
- Saved your life!
- You shit.

75
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,820
Why do you scare me to death?

76
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:44,200
It's better than seeing this gorgeous
body splattered all over the place.

77
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:45,660
Look out!

78
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,420
- Grab it!
- Sam, Moll! Are you guys home?

79
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,340
- Did you invite Carl?
- Slave labour.

80
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,470
- Carl!
- Hurry, help!

81
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,220
- Oh, my God.
- Grab the bottom.

82
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,930
- Now, go there.
- Here?

83
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,980
- Right here?
- Watch your toes.

84
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:13,560
- Where do you want this?
- In the bedroom.

85
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:18,110
- God, this place looks great!
- You like it, huh?

86
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,620
Like is hardly the word. I had no idea
it would be this beautiful. It's incredible.

87
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:26,990
- What about her?
- Leave her until the other stuff is here.

88
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,160
- What are these?
- Oh, let me show you.

89
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,250
Will you help me lift this up?

90
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:40,510
- Just finished it. What do you think?
- I love it.

91
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:44,010
Sam, what's this chair doing here?

92
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:47,510
- I love that chair.
- I know, but we discussed this.

93
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,930
I've had it forever.

94
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,230
- When I watch TV, I sit in it.
- This chair is ugly.

95
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,480
- And it doesn't go with anything.
- It goes with me.

96
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:01,610
You're right, it does.

97
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,620
- We'll paint it.
- We'll what?

98
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,130
Are you OK?

99
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,210
I'm fine.

100
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:23,680
What's the matter?

101
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,680
Nothing.

102
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:33,270
Are you worried about the promotion?

103
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,400
No, not really.

104
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,320
Then what - moving in together?

105
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,330
No.

106
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,790
I don't know. It's a lot of things.

107
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,760
I just don't want the bubble to burst.

108
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,220
It seems like...

109
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:15,770
..whenever anything good in my life
happens, l'm afraid l'm going to lose it.

110
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,990
I love you.

111
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,950
I really love you.

112
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,530
Ditto.

113
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:39,340
The pilot's first report of trouble was
he blew the number two engine...

114
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,630
Oh, Jesus. Another one?

115
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:47,260
Don't watch that.

116
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:52,720
I should cancel my LA trip.
These things always happen in threes.

117
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,980
Sam, get serious!

118
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:59,480
- Besides, you lead a charmed life.
- Yeah, so did they.

119
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,110
It's amazing. Just like that...

120
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,150
Blackout.

121
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:16,060
What are you doing?

122
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,270
I couldn't sleep.

123
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,560
Boy...

124
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,900
I really must have passed out.

125
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:28,900
- What time is it?
- It's 2 am.

126
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,970
Oh, no!

127
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,930
I hope it wasn't a masterpiece.

128
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,390
Well, it's not now.

129
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,100
- Can I help?
- Yeah.

130
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:06,190
Put your hands here...
Now get them wet.

131
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,990
Let the clay slide between your fingers.

132
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,540
Oh, no.

133
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:12,840
- What's the matter?
- A glitch. What's up?

134
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,710
The Greenberg and White accounts,
I can't get in. The code doesn't work.

135
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,220
- I changed it.
- Why?

136
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:25,140
- I just want to nose around a bit.
- Is something wrong?

137
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,560
Can you keep a secret?

138
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,600
Yeah, sure. What's up?

139
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,980
There's too much money
in these accounts.

140
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,900
That's impossible.

141
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:45,660
Sam, this is going to take you hours.
Let me do this.

142
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:49,870
- It already has taken me hours.
- Let me figure it out for you.

143
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,630
No, it's OK. It's like a vendetta now.

144
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:56,500
Thanks, though, I appreciate it.

145
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:00,510
- If you start to go blind, give a shout.
- OK. Adios.

146
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:04,800
Listen, what are you and Moll
doing tonight?

147
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:08,060
We're going to the theatre.
She wants to see Macbeth.

148
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,730
I think she likes the guys in tights.

149
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:14,310
- You want to go?
- No. I want a full report, though.

150
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,770
- Later.
- Yeah.

151
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:26,030
Well, I loved it.
I was spellbound the whole time.

152
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:31,870
I could tell, and so could the rest of
the audience, with that snore of yours.

153
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:41,130
- Did I tell you what Marcia said?
- About six times.

154
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:45,390
It wasn't six times.
Quit being so blas?about this.

155
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:49,100
This was really important. I'm going
to have two pieces in her gallery.

156
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:52,890
The New York Times
reviews her gallery all the time.

157
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:57,190
The New York Times is a frustrated
critic with pimples on his ass

158
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,110
who flunked art school.
Who cares what they think?

159
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,950
About 8 million readers, that's who.

160
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:07,830
No, they're just reading
the sports page.

161
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:12,160
Your work is really beautiful.
It really is.

162
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:16,830
It shouldn't matter what anyone else
thinks, just what I think.

163
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:24,590
- I want to marry you, Sam.
- What?

164
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:31,720
- What?
- Yeah, I've been thinking about it.

165
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,600
I've been thinking about it a lot.

166
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:37,270
I think we should just do it.

167
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,480
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

168
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:47,360
What's that look for?

169
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:54,080
You never wanted to talk about it.

170
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:09,800
- Do you love me, Sam?
- What do you think?

171
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:13,100
- Why don't you ever say it?
- What do you mean?

172
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:18,400
- I say it all the time.
- You say "ditto." That's not the same.

173
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:25,440
People say "l love you" all the time,
and it doesn't mean anything.

174
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,990
Sometimes you need to hear it.

175
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:35,700
I need to hear it.

176
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,670
Let's go!

177
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:48,680
- What should we do?
- Let me handle it.

178
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,970
- What do you want?
- Your wallet!

179
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:55,100
Sam, just give it to him.

180
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,650
Just take the money. Just leave...

181
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:01,440
No! Sam!

182
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,730
You son of a bitch!

183
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,660
Somebody help us!

184
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:19,620
Somebody! Somebody help us!

185
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:25,380
Stop it, Sam!

186
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,740
Molly?

187
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,410
Molly! You got...?

188
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:07,880
Oh, baby, hold on.
You're going to be OK.

189
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,930
Somebody? Somebody!

190
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:16,560
Somebody help us!

191
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:23,270
Oh, my God!
Oh, Sam, come on. Come on, baby.

192
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:29,240
You're going to be OK.

193
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:42,710
Somebody? Somebody help me!

194
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:47,250
Please, anybody!

195
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:51,920
OK, lady, take it easy.
We'll help you.

196
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,640
Molly? Molly?

197
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,010
Molly!

198
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:04,440
What shall we do?

199
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:18,330
What's happening? What's...

200
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:19,830
Is he breathing?

201
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:30,000
Oh, goddamn, hold on.

202
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:56,030
Here we go.

203
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:04,210
Sam, don't you leave me! Hold on!

204
00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:00,180
If you would just step this way.

205
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:21,950
- So, what happened to you?
- What?

206
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,870
You're new, huh? I can tell.

207
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,040
- Are you talking to me?
- Relax, it ain't like before.

208
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,580
It's a whole new ball of wax.

209
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,590
- Who are you?
- I'm waiting for my wife.

210
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:37,840
She's in the cardiac wing.
She's fighting it.

211
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:49,600
Shot? That'll do it every time.

212
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,610
Poor bastard.

213
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:57,400
You may as well get used to it -
you could be here for a long while.

214
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:06,040
I'll tell you a secret.
Doors ain't as bad as you think.

215
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,290
Zip-zap - ain't nothing at all.
You'll see. You'll catch on.

216
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,380
He ain't going to make it. I've seen it
a million times - he's a goner.

217
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:28,270
You see? Here they come.

218
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:36,650
Lucky bastard!
It could have been the other ones.

219
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,980
You never know.

220
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,220
Who are they?

221
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,680
No!

222
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,730
God help me!

223
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,360
Help me!

224
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:32,500
"l am sunk in the abysmal swamp
where there is no foothold."

225
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:38,420
"l have reached the watery depths.
The flood overwhelms me."

226
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:41,760
"l am wearied with calling."

227
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:46,220
As we say farewell to our friend,
Sam Wheat,

228
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:49,350
we are reminded of his kindness,

229
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,890
his generosity,

230
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:55,270
his buoyancy of spirit.

231
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,440
All that we treasure,

232
00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:03,030
our loved ones,
our friends, our body...

233
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:05,450
..our mind,

234
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:11,160
are but on loan to us.
We must surrender them all.

235
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:16,790
We are all travellers on the same road,
which leads to the same end.

236
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:23,760
As our loved one enters eternal life,

237
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,300
Iet us remember
that love, too, is eternal.

238
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:32,970
That although we will miss him,
our love will light the void

239
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,680
and dispel the darkness.

240
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,430
I picked up your shirts today.

241
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:22,360
I don't know why.

242
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:28,280
Mr Reynolds told me to tell you "hello."

243
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:33,700
I broke into tears.

244
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:39,670
It's like I think about you every minute.

245
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:42,500
It's like I can still feel you.

246
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,390
I'm here, Moll.

247
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,320
What's the matter, kitty?

248
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,110
What's the matter?

249
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,530
Crazy cat.

250
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,870
Sam?

251
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,290
It's really stupid.

252
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,760
I love this picture.

253
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:36,890
It's great. Office.

254
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:48,650
Let me see that!

255
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,280
Sam's address book.

256
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:01,580
- Dave Brubeck, should I toss them?
- No.

257
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:04,500
No? Molly, we hated that concert.

258
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:09,590
You wanted to save those?

259
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,630
Rolaids? Molly, what are you doing?

260
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:25,230
I just miss him, Carl.

261
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,230
Me, too.

262
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:33,740
Carl? Wait a minute.

263
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,450
Not that one.

264
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:40,490
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to put that on there.

265
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:43,870
Hey, Moll. Why don't you come?

266
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:48,340
- It's like summer outside.
- No. I'm really not up for it.

267
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:52,340
- It would be good for you to get out.
- I don't want to.

268
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:55,130
You can't stay in here all day.
It's not healthy.

269
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,430
I can't do it!

270
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,600
You're not the one who died.

271
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:07,230
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologise.

272
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,360
Shit!

273
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:17,700
- Maybe you're right. Just a short one.
- That a girl!

274
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,830
I'm sorry.

275
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,870
Molly?

276
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:28,350
What are you doing here?

277
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,150
You bastard!

278
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:34,820
You son of a bitch!

279
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:53,630
What do you want?

280
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,460
Molly?

281
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,260
Molly, get out!

282
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,560
No, Molly!

283
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:09,770
No, please?

284
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,810
He's got a gun, Molly!

285
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,030
Hi, kitty.

286
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,070
You hurt her, l'll...

287
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,350
Shit!

288
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,190
Is somebody there?

289
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:56,570
Hello?

290
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,650
Let go! What are you doing?

291
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:23,070
Like trains?

292
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,750
Stay out! This is mine.

293
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,370
Shit!

294
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,670
It's me. I couldn't get it.

295
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,140
She came home.

296
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:14,010
Give me a couple of days. I'll go back.

297
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:17,560
Relax. I'll get it.

298
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,310
Get what?

299
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:28,240
Who are you?
What do you want from us?

300
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:35,870
No. You stay away from her!

301
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:39,080
Do you hear me?

302
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,500
You stay away from her!

303
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:46,060
Rosa Santiago?

304
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:53,820
Please be seated.

305
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:11,260
Our sister will be with us soon.

306
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,470
Sister Oda Mae,

307
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:20,680
grant us the gift
of your all-seeing presence.

308
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:23,640
Appear before us now.

309
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,520
Mrs Santiago?

310
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:35,030
- Buenos dias.
- I'm Oda Mae Brown.

311
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:40,030
You wish to contact your husband.
I believe he'll be with us today.

312
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,330
Thank you.

313
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:46,210
But you know, Mrs Santiago,

314
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:49,250
there's no telling
about that other world,

315
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:53,130
so you've got to be a believer.
Are you a believer?

316
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,930
S? I believe, I believe.

317
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:59,260
Then let us begin.

318
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,830
I can't.

319
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:24,500
It's too difficult.

320
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:29,080
I just can't seem to make contact.
No - wait!

321
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:32,290
I'm feeling something.

322
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:38,050
Did he know someone
by the name of Anna?

323
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,720
Consuelo?

324
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,350
Lucita? Julietta?

325
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,930
Josephina? Linda? Maria?

326
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,350
S? s? His Mama, she is Maria.

327
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:54,610
Yes! Praise God.
I knew he was with his Mama.

328
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,530
Oh, my God...

329
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:07,040
It's too difficult. It's two of them -
I'm not sure I can do that.

330
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,460
I pay more! How much?

331
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,460
- How much?
- Twenty dollars.

332
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:15,880
Way to go. Milk her for every penny.

333
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:36,280
Yes. I believe we can start again.

334
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:54,750
Praise the Lord! Thank you, Jesus.

335
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:16,110
Welcome, Mrs Santiago. You are
fortunate, the spirits are churning.

336
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:18,610
- My husband?
- Mercy!

337
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,280
Oh, yeah, where?

338
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,780
- Julio?
- Yes.

339
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:29,580
I feel his vibration.

340
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:36,460
- I see him.
- How is he? How does he look?

341
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:38,210
He's a handsome man.

342
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:42,380
Handsome?

343
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:46,510
Mrs Santiago, in our Father's
Kingdom, we're all handsome.

344
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,220
Oh, Julio.

345
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:53,730
Julio is coming towards us.
I see him! He's coming.

346
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,480
He's there.

347
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:01,190
He's dressed in a black suit.

348
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:06,070
Black suit?

349
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:10,200
- Could be blue.
- What a crock of shit.

350
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:12,540
Who is that?

351
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,710
Where are you?

352
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:17,210
Did you hear it?

353
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:19,300
Where are you?

354
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,550
- Who are you?
- Who?

355
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:26,090
- You can hear me?
- Can't you hear him?

356
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:30,760
I don't believe this. My name
is Sam Wheat. Can you hear me?

357
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:35,560
- Say my name, "Sam Wheat."
- Leave me alone!

358
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:39,650
- Talk to me, Oda Mae.
- Sam Wheat.

359
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:45,570
- Jesus... !
- Sam Wheat?

360
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:50,700
I swear, no more cheating. I'll do
anything, just make that guy go away.

361
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:52,410
No way.

362
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,300
It's OK.

363
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:11,640
- All right, sister?
- Yeah, you're all right.

364
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:15,680
My mother had it, and her mother.
They both had the gift.

365
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:20,650
They always said I had it,
but I never did, I never had it.

366
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:25,860
They told me all about it, but now that
I've got it, I don't think I want it.

367
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:28,610
Just go away. Find somebody else.

368
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:31,910
- You're out of your mind.
- I'm getting there fast.

369
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,790
She hit her head hard.

370
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:36,710
She was talking to somebody
before that.

371
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:39,120
Sister can do that.

372
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:43,170
- Where exactly are you?
- Standing right beside you.

373
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:47,340
- You're standing right beside me?
- Honey, we're right here!

374
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:49,930
- Are you white?
- What?

375
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:52,850
- White?
- You're white, aren't you?

376
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:55,770
- You know what?
- I'm calling the doctor.

377
00:44:55,930 --> 00:45:00,860
- I knew it, a white guy! Why me?
- You're going to help me.

378
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:05,860
There's a woman who is in terrible
danger. The man who killed me

379
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:10,280
is going back to our apartment.
You've got to warn her.

380
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:15,370
- Why would she listen to me?
- It's just a phone call.

381
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,870
Look...

382
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:26,510
..you're all I've got. I'm not leaving
until you help me.

383
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:30,840
I don't care how long it takes,
because I can talk forever.

384
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:48,820
- Hello.
- Hi, is this Molly Jensen?

385
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:52,700
My name is Oda Mae Brown,
l'm a spiritual advisor.

386
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:55,030
I have a message for you.

387
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:01,210
It sounds crazy, but it's not. You're
got to believe me, don't be afraid.

388
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:04,500
- Who is this?
- I've got a message from Sam.

389
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:10,930
- What?
- Sam Wheat asked me to call.

390
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:15,550
- I told you!
- You're got to go there.

391
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,520
I'm not going anywhere.

392
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:21,640
Second verse, same as the first.

393
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:26,770
I'm Henry the Eighth, I am
Henry the Eighth I am, I am

394
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:32,400
I got married to the widow next door,
she's been married seven times before

395
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:45,040
Henry the Eighth I am, I am
Henry the Eighth I am

396
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:47,550
Second verse, same as the first

397
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:52,470
I'm Henry the Eighth, I am
Henry the Eighth I am, I am

398
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:56,970
- I got married to the widow next door.
- All right! Stop singing.

399
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:01,560
I'll go anywhere you want to,
just don't sing any more.

400
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:13,150
I can't believe l'm doing this. What
am I doing here? I hate downtown!

401
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:18,030
She's probably not even there.
Where are you?

402
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:21,580
Which building is it?

403
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:25,670
Push 3.

404
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,170
- See, nobody's there.
- Just wait.

405
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:33,840
I did everything I said I would.
She's not there. I'm going.

406
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:37,470
I'm sorry.

407
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:40,260
All right, don't sing.

408
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:44,560
- Hello?
- Hi... She can't hear you.

409
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:50,520
I called you last night
about your friend, Sam Wheat.

410
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:51,860
I told you!

411
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:02,370
Hey, Molly. I know you're up there.

412
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:05,790
I know you hear me.
Sam wants to talk to you.

413
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,880
This is for real!

414
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,170
Remember the starfish at Montego Bay?

415
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:13,630
How would I know that?

416
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:18,180
I know about the underwear
you wrote your name on!

417
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:20,390
I won't forget that.

418
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:24,270
I know about the picture in Reno.

419
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:26,020
Hey, Molly!

420
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,070
The sweater she knitted,
in the closet, that's too big.

421
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:37,360
He just told me about the sweater
that you knitted that's too big.

422
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,570
Four sizes.

423
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,200
- Do you hear me?
- I hear you!

424
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:48,250
- Nobody's talking to you.
- Hear of the phone?

425
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:50,040
Want to kiss my butt?

426
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,880
- I won't stay here all day.
- Thank God!

427
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:55,920
Oh, shut up!

428
00:48:56,090 --> 00:49:00,590
Molly, l'm going to count to three,
and then l'm out of here.

429
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:03,350
One-two-three.

430
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:06,140
- No, wait.
- No.

431
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:08,140
It's Molly.

432
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,570
Molly?

433
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:20,610
I'm Oda Mae Brown.

434
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:28,910
I don't know you or Sam,
but let me tell you what he did.

435
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,960
He kept me up all night singing
"l'm Henry the Eighth, I am."

436
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:36,960
That's how he got me
to go out with him.

437
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:39,840
Look, l'm sorry.

438
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:43,640
I just don't believe in this
life after death stuff.

439
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:47,060
- Tell her she's wrong.
- He says you're wrong.

440
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:50,100
- You're talking to him right now?
- Yeah.

441
00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:52,440
He asked me to tell you
that you're wrong.

442
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:57,480
- Where is he?
- I can't see him, I can only hear him.

443
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:02,320
- I'm right here.
- That doesn't help, Sam.

444
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:07,830
- I'm holding her hand.
- He says he's holding your hand.

445
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:23,140
What are you doing?
What do you think you're doing to me?

446
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:26,350
If you think l'm here for my health,
you're crazy.

447
00:50:26,510 --> 00:50:29,350
Sam's dead. He's dead.

448
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,350
- Tell her I love her.
- He says he loves you.

449
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,480
Sam would never say that.

450
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:39,990
- Tell her "ditto."
- What is "ditto"?

451
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:42,990
Ditto!

452
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,850
I don't know how l'm doing this.

453
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:20,400
Confidentially - nothing like this
has ever happened to me before.

454
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:22,950
Now I can't turn it off.

455
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:28,200
- Is this him? ls this you?
- Yeah.

456
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:31,790
Cute! White, but cute.

457
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:35,000
What I don't understand is,
why did he come back?

458
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:38,250
- I don't know.
- Why's he still here?

459
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:41,380
He's stuck, he's in between worlds.

460
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:45,470
Sometimes the spirit
gets yanked out so quick,

461
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:48,430
the essence still feels
it has work to do.

462
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:52,470
- Stop rambling.
- I'm not, l'm answering a question.

463
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,100
- He's got an attitude.
- I don't.

464
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:58,270
Yes, you do.
We're having a little discussion.

465
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:02,400
If you didn't, you wouldn't
have raised your voice.

466
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:07,200
- Oh, goddammit...
- Don't take the Lord's name in vain.

467
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,580
- Would you relax?
- You're the dead guy.

468
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:12,450
If you want me to help,
you're better apologise.

469
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:17,790
That's it, l'm leaving.
Nobody talks to me like that.

470
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:23,380
- Now, you're better apologise.
- I'm sorry. I apologise. OK?

471
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,720
Now would you sit down?

472
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,640
- Please?
- He's apologised.

473
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:33,180
I need you to tell Molly
what l'm saying,

474
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:37,560
but you have to tell her
word for word, all right?

475
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:44,150
Yes. He wants me to tell you
what he's saying word for word.

476
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:51,410
- Molly, you're in danger.
- You can't blurt it out like that!

477
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:55,960
Quit moving around - you're making
me dizzy. I'll tell her in my own way.

478
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:01,250
Molly, you're in danger, girl.

479
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:07,010
- What are you talking about?
- He knows the man who killed him.

480
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:09,800
His name is Willie Lopez,
and I know where he lives.

481
00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:12,390
His name is Willie Lopez,
and he knows where he lives.

482
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:16,600
- Write it down.
- I ain't no secretary!

483
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:18,770
Just do it!

484
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:22,270
He's so testy!

485
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:28,280
- What do I write?
- It's 303, Prospect Place, apt. 4D.

486
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:31,870
303 Prospect Place?

487
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:35,200
- It's my neighbourhood.
- Molly, he's got my wallet,

488
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:38,370
he's got my key, and he was in here.

489
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:42,040
- He was in here.
- Yesterday, when you came back,

490
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:45,340
you went upstairs,
you talked to Floyd...

491
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:50,680
When you came back he was here.
He saw everything.

492
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:55,140
Molly, go to the police.
It was a set-up. I was murdered.

493
00:53:56,890 --> 00:53:59,890
He says go to the police.
It was a set-up, he was murdered.

494
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:05,230
- Somebody else is involved.
- Forget it. I don't want this.

495
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,860
- Where are you going?
- I'm leaving.

496
00:54:08,030 --> 00:54:12,360
I did everything I said I would.
Don't follow me, because l'm finished.

497
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:16,040
Have a nice life, have a nice death,
goodbye.

498
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:23,500
There's no one on earth who
want this to be true more than me.

499
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:26,710
You've got to be rational about this.

500
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,880
Sam is no more in this room than...

501
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:37,260
I understand the need
to hang on to him, I really do.

502
00:54:37,430 --> 00:54:42,770
- But this is absurd!
- It seems absurd, but it had to be real.

503
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:46,860
How could you believe
a fortune-teller from Brooklyn?

504
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:52,490
- I watched them have a conversation.
- I don't buy it, not for a minute.

505
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:56,120
- What about the things she knew?
- What things?

506
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:01,910
The photo Sam took of me
on our trip to Reno. We were alone.

507
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:06,040
And the green underwear
that I wrote my name in.

508
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,130
She said Sam knew who killed him.

509
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:17,850
- That he was set up.
- This is getting deranged.

510
00:55:18,010 --> 00:55:20,430
- She had a name and an address.
- Good, Molly...

511
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:24,600
Willie Lopez,
303 Prospect Place, apt. 4D.

512
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:30,440
- This is sick.
- Oh, Carl!

513
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:37,030
Molly, I don't understand
how you could...

514
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:41,700
..swallow this crap.

515
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:44,540
This guy may not even exist.

516
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:49,090
Maybe she's using you
to set someone up.

517
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:53,800
You're right. You're absolutely right.

518
00:55:53,970 --> 00:55:58,390
- That's what I've got to find out.
- How are you going to do that?

519
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:01,140
She said Sam wants me
to go to the police.

520
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:06,100
Sam wants you to go to the police?
Jesus, Moll... !

521
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:08,310
What are you going to tell them?

522
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:13,240
That some storefront psychic lady
has been communing with the dead?

523
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:18,070
Do you know how that sounds?
You're talking ghosts here!

524
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:21,330
I'm sorry,

525
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:24,460
this really gets to me.

526
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:29,170
- It's OK if you don't believe me.
- I'm trying to, Molly.

527
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:34,630
Look...

528
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:40,970
..if it'll make you feel any better,
l'll go check this out.

529
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:44,140
I want you to try and get some sleep.

530
00:56:44,310 --> 00:56:46,100
OK?

531
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:51,900
I'll call you in the morning.
Goodnight.

532
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:20,930
Be careful!

533
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:38,490
Carl! What the hell
are you doing here?

534
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:44,240
- Who have you been talking to?
- What do you mean?

535
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:48,960
Some woman knows all about you.
Where's she getting it from?

536
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:53,340
- I haven't said a word to anybody.
- She knows your name and address.

537
00:57:53,500 --> 00:58:00,010
- How do women know where I live?
- She knows about the murder!

538
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:03,600
Now, I want you to find this bitch,
whoever she is,

539
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,760
and I want you to...

540
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:09,890
Just get rid of her, OK?

541
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:15,980
I've got 4 million dollars stuffed in
a goddamn computer.

542
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:20,990
If I don't get those codes,
if that money is not transferred soon...

543
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:26,740
..l'm... dead. We're both dead.

544
00:58:26,910 --> 00:58:30,290
Tell them you only launder money
on the first of the month.

545
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:35,290
What the hell is wrong with you?
ls everything a joke?

546
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:39,130
You killed a man.
You were supposed to steal his wallet.

547
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:42,090
I did you a favour, man,
that was a freebie.

548
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:46,350
Look, these are drug dealers, OK?

549
00:58:47,810 --> 00:58:51,810
Just don't blow this for me, Willie.
I've lost my job, go to jail.

550
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:55,190
$80,000 of that money is mine.

551
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:02,360
Let me have the keys
to Sam's apartment,

552
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:05,370
I'll get the address book myself, OK?

553
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:35,350
You goddamn bastard! Why?

554
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:39,530
You were my friend!

555
00:59:39,690 --> 00:59:42,190
I had a life, goddamn you!

556
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,450
I had a life!

557
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:56,210
I don't even believe
in this stuff myself.

558
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:58,920
But she was real.

559
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:02,050
Do you think I've come here
if it wasn't real?

560
01:00:03,970 --> 01:00:08,510
You told me if I had any new
information, that I should come.

561
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:10,850
So, here I am.

562
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:20,480
I know how this sounds. I hear myself
saying it, and I want to cringe.

563
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:26,030
But she knew things she couldn't have
known. Things Sam only said to me.

564
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:29,530
According to this psychic lady,

565
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:33,700
there are ghosts and spirits
all over the place?

566
01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:36,540
Watching us all the time?

567
01:00:39,290 --> 01:00:41,960
I'm never going
to get undressed again.

568
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:47,590
Excuse me.
I've got more important things to do.

569
01:00:57,650 --> 01:01:03,110
The guy's name is Willie Lopez.
All l'm asking is for you to check it out.

570
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:07,950
OK. You wait here and let me see
if the guy's got a record.

571
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:11,490
Right.

572
01:02:12,550 --> 01:02:17,810
- Where's the file on Willie Lopez?
- There's no file for Willie Lopez.

573
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:22,310
He was probably some old boyfriend
she was trying to get even with.

574
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:26,440
This psychic woman's
got a long record.

575
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:29,570
1 967, Shreveport.

576
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:33,370
Forgery, selling of false ID.

577
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:36,120
Served one year in 1 971 .

578
01:02:36,290 --> 01:02:38,870
Arrested for fraud,

579
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:42,920
numbers racketeering,
served ten months, 1 974.

580
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:46,840
- Look, this is impossible!
- It goes on and on.

581
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:51,430
She knew things - private things.
How could she have known all that?

582
01:02:51,590 --> 01:02:53,930
A lot of times they read the obits.

583
01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:57,350
All she had to do
was see the word "banker." Boom.

584
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:02,100
They even go through your garbage
to find things they can use.

585
01:03:02,270 --> 01:03:06,110
Letters, old papers.
It doesn't take much.

586
01:03:06,270 --> 01:03:07,900
No.

587
01:03:09,570 --> 01:03:12,110
It was real.

588
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:18,790
She knew about a sweater I knitted.

589
01:03:18,950 --> 01:03:21,660
And songs we sang.

590
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:30,170
The trip to Montego Bay.

591
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:34,220
I'm sorry. I know this is hard.

592
01:03:34,390 --> 01:03:35,890
People want so much to believe.

593
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:42,270
They're grieving, they're vulnerable.
And they will give anything

594
01:03:42,430 --> 01:03:48,650
for one last moment. Believe me,
these people know what they're doing.

595
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:53,990
I know how you must feel,
but you know you can press charges.

596
01:03:57,780 --> 01:03:59,740
No.

597
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:04,500
Thank you.

598
01:04:18,550 --> 01:04:20,720
Oh, God, let this be it.

599
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:35,150
Yes!

600
01:04:46,830 --> 01:04:49,840
- Hello.
- Eddie, it's Carl Bruner.

601
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:55,420
Everything's fine. We're all set.
What do you want me to do?

602
01:04:55,590 --> 01:04:59,390
I want you to transfer the money
into a single account

603
01:04:59,550 --> 01:05:02,430
under the name "Rita Miller. "

604
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:06,140
Tomorrow, at five minutes
before closing, 3.55 pm,

605
01:05:06,310 --> 01:05:10,020
transfer the full account to
the First lsland Bank ofNassau,

606
01:05:10,190 --> 01:05:13,900
registry number 486-9580.

607
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:18,530
- Call us when it's done.
- OK, I've got it.

608
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:22,330
Just tell Mr Balistrari that there
won't be any more problems, OK.

609
01:05:22,490 --> 01:05:25,500
Yeah, l'll do that. Good work.

610
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:28,980
Molly, why can't you hear me?
I need you.

611
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:44,990
- Who is it?
- It's Carl, Molly.

612
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:48,950
No, don't open the goddamn door!
He's a murderer.

613
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:52,630
Listen, I know it's late.
I'm sorry to disturb you.

614
01:06:52,830 --> 01:06:55,960
I've been thinking about you all day.

615
01:06:56,130 --> 01:06:59,420
I feel really lousy about last night.

616
01:06:59,590 --> 01:07:03,720
- This supernatural thing...
- Don't worry about it, really. It's OK.

617
01:07:03,890 --> 01:07:07,720
It's not. You needed me
to hear you, and I didn't.

618
01:07:07,890 --> 01:07:12,480
I wasn't there for you,
and that was wrong.

619
01:07:12,650 --> 01:07:16,110
It's just... I just...

620
01:07:16,270 --> 01:07:19,650
I want you to know
that l'm your friend.

621
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:23,110
- Thanks, Carl.
- You were never her friend.

622
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:26,330
- That means a lot to me.
- Me, too.

623
01:07:26,530 --> 01:07:29,870
I've brought you some
Japanese apple pears.

624
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:37,040
- Thanks, that's very sweet.
- Could I come in for a second?

625
01:07:37,210 --> 01:07:40,300
I won't stay long,
it's just been one of those days.

626
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:43,340
- Yeah, come on in.
- No, Molly.

627
01:07:44,010 --> 01:07:46,890
You seem a little tense. Are you OK?

628
01:07:47,050 --> 01:07:53,310
No, l'm fine. It's just...
What can I tell you? lt's been tough.

629
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:55,230
It still hurts so much.

630
01:07:55,400 --> 01:08:00,030
- You lying snake!
- On top of it, there's stuff at work.

631
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:03,860
They've given me my own accounts,
which is good.

632
01:08:04,030 --> 01:08:06,570
But I just haven't really
had time to adjust,

633
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:10,040
to absorb everything.

634
01:08:13,250 --> 01:08:14,710
It's no big deal.

635
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:30,060
- Can I have a little more cream?
- Yeah.

636
01:08:31,430 --> 01:08:35,190
Oh, shit!
Jesus, I can't believe I did that.

637
01:08:35,350 --> 01:08:37,020
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

638
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:44,700
- Let me throw that in the washer.
- Don't worry about it. It's OK.

639
01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:48,780
- Can I get you another shirt?
- No, it'll dry in a minute.

640
01:08:54,580 --> 01:09:00,000
Where were you today? I thought
you were coming into the bank.

641
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:05,630
I was supposed to, but I didn't
have time. I went to the police.

642
01:09:12,390 --> 01:09:16,600
You did? What did you tell them?
What did they say?

643
01:09:16,810 --> 01:09:19,270
It was awful.

644
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:22,900
I felt really stupid.

645
01:09:23,110 --> 01:09:27,950
They brought out a file on this woman
at least ten inches thick.

646
01:09:28,110 --> 01:09:30,620
- Rip-off artist, huh?
- No, Molly!

647
01:09:32,870 --> 01:09:37,830
You know, the sad thing
is that I believed her.

648
01:09:38,830 --> 01:09:40,790
Molly...

649
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:45,210
..sometimes we need to believe.

650
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:47,470
Why? What's the point?

651
01:09:47,630 --> 01:09:50,180
It's not easy to face the realities of life.

652
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:53,060
Sometimes you've
got to give yourself that.

653
01:09:53,220 --> 01:09:56,980
You've got to remember
the love you guys felt. That's real.

654
01:09:57,180 --> 01:10:00,400
Remember how good Sam was,
how much he loved you.

655
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:04,820
You were everything to him, Molly.
You were his life.

656
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:20,370
I feel so alone.

657
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:31,890
You're not alone, OK.

658
01:10:32,050 --> 01:10:35,510
You've got your work - you're talented.
You're young.

659
01:10:36,350 --> 01:10:38,810
You're fantastically gorgeous.

660
01:10:40,350 --> 01:10:43,690
I don't know what's real anymore.

661
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:46,070
I don't know what to think.

662
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:51,780
Just think about Sam.

663
01:10:53,740 --> 01:10:59,080
Think about the time you two guys
had together. How wonderful that was.

664
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:05,840
Let your feelings out, it's OK.

665
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,010
Life turns on a dime.

666
01:11:10,170 --> 01:11:12,680
You know...?

667
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:20,850
People think they're forever, that there
is always tomorrow. That's bullshit.

668
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:24,560
Sam taught us that.

669
01:11:24,730 --> 01:11:26,730
We have to live for now.

670
01:11:29,650 --> 01:11:31,900
For today.

671
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:53,380
- I can't. I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

672
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:57,100
- I can't, it's just too soon.
- It's OK.

673
01:11:57,260 --> 01:11:59,970
You've been great, Carl.

674
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:05,600
- But I need you to leave.
- It's OK, I understand.

675
01:12:05,810 --> 01:12:07,770
Please...

676
01:12:13,490 --> 01:12:19,490
Could we just have dinner tomorrow?
Just talk.

677
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:22,410
- Yeah, sure.
- Great.

678
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,730
Hey!

679
01:13:36,530 --> 01:13:39,570
- Get off my train!
- No.

680
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:41,990
Get off!

681
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:44,870
Get off! Get off!

682
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:47,540
Get off! Get out of here!

683
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:50,130
- Get off!
- No.

684
01:13:50,290 --> 01:13:53,500
Show me how you do that.
I'm not leaving till you teach me.

685
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:55,710
Get off!

686
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:57,420
- No.
- Get off!

687
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:07,730
You stubborn asshole!

688
01:14:10,230 --> 01:14:16,110
What the hell are you doing? You're
trying to move it with your fingers.

689
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:18,530
You can't push it with your finger.
You're dead.

690
01:14:27,370 --> 01:14:32,790
It's all in your mind. Your problem
is that you still think you're real.

691
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:36,800
You think you're wearing those clothes?
That you're crouching there?

692
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:41,970
Bullshit! You ain't got a body no more.
It's all up here now.

693
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:47,600
You want to move something, you're
got to move it with your mind. Focus!

694
01:14:47,770 --> 01:14:51,940
- How? How do you focus?
- I don't know how you focus.

695
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:54,060
You just focus.

696
01:14:57,820 --> 01:14:59,240
How did you do that?

697
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:03,120
You take all of your emotions,
all your anger, love, hate.

698
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:06,660
Push it, down here
into the pit of your stomach,

699
01:15:06,830 --> 01:15:09,660
and then let it explode, like a reactor.

700
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:21,220
Don't laugh!

701
01:15:45,530 --> 01:15:50,000
- Way to go, kid.
- I did it!

702
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,330
I did it!

703
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:54,540
Way to go.

704
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:03,010
From your gut, like I told you.

705
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:09,270
Give it time.
What else have you got?

706
01:16:17,230 --> 01:16:18,730
How long have you been here?

707
01:16:21,190 --> 01:16:23,150
Since they pushed me.

708
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:26,030
- Someone pushed you?
- Yeah.

709
01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:29,240
- Who?
- You don't believe me?

710
01:16:29,410 --> 01:16:33,370
You think I fell? You think I jumped?
Well, fuck you!

711
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:37,250
It wasn't my time!
I wasn't supposed to go!

712
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:39,710
I'm not supposed to be here.

713
01:16:49,390 --> 01:16:52,890
I're give anything for a drag!

714
01:16:53,060 --> 01:16:57,190
- Just one drag.
- Are you all right?

715
01:16:57,350 --> 01:17:02,190
Who are you? Why are you
hounding me? Who sent you?

716
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:06,700
Who sent you?

717
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:13,830
Leave me alone!

718
01:18:13,510 --> 01:18:16,980
Concentrate, and you'll
probably rouse him.

719
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:20,650
- What's his name again?
- Orlando.

720
01:18:20,860 --> 01:18:24,440
Orlando, Orlando.
Is there an Orlando here?

721
01:18:24,610 --> 01:18:26,820
- I'm here.
- He's here.

722
01:18:26,990 --> 01:18:31,160
- Sam!
- I'm Orlando. The line's over there.

723
01:18:31,370 --> 01:18:35,620
Where did these ghosts come from?
You can hear them, too?

724
01:18:35,790 --> 01:18:39,750
In the morning and in the evening.
They come into the shower!

725
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:43,380
Did you tell every spook in the world
about me?

726
01:18:43,540 --> 01:18:48,380
I got spooks from Jersey. There's stuff
going on you wouldn't believe.

727
01:18:48,550 --> 01:18:53,350
- It's amazing. You're really doing it!
- Can you please hurry this up?

728
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:55,510
Chill out!

729
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:59,060
I need your help again.
There's something we need to do.

730
01:18:59,230 --> 01:19:01,600
I'm not doing anything else with you.

731
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:07,480
You're holding on to a life that doesn't
want you anymore. Give up the ghost.

732
01:19:07,650 --> 01:19:12,700
- Are you speaking to me?
- Does it look like l'm speaking to you?

733
01:19:12,870 --> 01:19:17,580
You're supposed to be concentrating.
Are you going to try it?

734
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:20,410
Are you going to get out?
l're got work to do.

735
01:19:20,580 --> 01:19:25,420
Fine, then stay there.
Excuse me, are you ready now?

736
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:28,050
Let's do it.

737
01:19:28,210 --> 01:19:32,510
Listen, l're got to talk to you now.
I're got a plan.

738
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:38,020
Oda Mae?

739
01:19:43,270 --> 01:19:45,440
Oda Mae?

740
01:19:46,770 --> 01:19:49,070
Ortisha.

741
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:54,200
- Orlando! ls that you?
- Where are you at? I can hardly see.

742
01:19:54,370 --> 01:19:58,740
- She's here!
- In front of you. I'm right here!

743
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:05,580
Damn, baby, what did you do
to your hair?

744
01:20:07,670 --> 01:20:11,800
Orlando, do you like it?
lt's autumn sunrise.

745
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:17,760
Get out of me, you son of a bitch!

746
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:24,770
- Don't ever do that to me again!
- Orlando...?

747
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:28,820
I can barely move.

748
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:32,900
You should know better.
Jumping into bodies wipes you out.

749
01:20:33,070 --> 01:20:37,950
- Everybody out!
- What happened to Orlando?

750
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:41,790
Are you deaf? I said everybody out!

751
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,920
Everybody out! Get out, get out!
Everybody get out!

752
01:20:58,550 --> 01:21:01,270
- Get out!
- Are you the fortune-teller?

753
01:21:01,430 --> 01:21:05,350
- Who are you?
- That's an interesting question.

754
01:21:05,980 --> 01:21:08,270
- Why don't you tell me?
- Willie.

755
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:10,360
Willie?

756
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:14,320
- Prospect Place Willie?
- Get out of here fast!

757
01:21:29,710 --> 01:21:31,590
I'm all right.

758
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:39,350
- We're in trouble. You have to help.
- Who's we? You're already dead.

759
01:21:39,510 --> 01:21:43,180
- They're trying to kill me!
- And they'll be back.

760
01:21:43,390 --> 01:21:46,810
Why don't you find a house to haunt?

761
01:21:47,020 --> 01:21:49,480
Get some chains and rattle them.

762
01:21:49,690 --> 01:21:52,900
I have a plan.
You're got to get some fake IDs.

763
01:21:53,070 --> 01:21:57,820
- Forget it.
- If you do this, they'll leave you alone.

764
01:22:02,910 --> 01:22:04,540
Scout's honour.

765
01:22:05,830 --> 01:22:07,960
All right.

766
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:10,750
What exactly do I have to do?

767
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:14,550
Have you got a nice dress?

768
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:22,810
- What's wrong with my clothes?
- I made a joke. I love your shoes.

769
01:22:22,970 --> 01:22:27,600
I'm going home. I don't know anything
about banking. I don't know if it'll work.

770
01:22:27,770 --> 01:22:30,400
- Just relax.
- I'm nervous.

771
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:34,610
I know you're nervous,
but l'll get you through it.

772
01:22:34,780 --> 01:22:36,690
Sam. I don't think I should do this.

773
01:22:36,860 --> 01:22:41,910
Straight ahead. A stairway that says new accounts.
- I'm giving them no money!

774
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:44,790
Do what I say, and don't talk!

775
01:22:47,450 --> 01:22:49,830
Tell her you're here to fill out a signature card for a new account.

776
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,460
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

777
01:22:51,630 --> 01:22:55,170
I'm here to fill out
a card for a new account.

778
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:59,430
- Do you know your account number?
- 926-31 043.

779
01:22:59,590 --> 01:23:03,260
926-31 043.

780
01:23:05,010 --> 01:23:06,850
- Rita Miller.
- What?

781
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:08,600
Tell her Rita Miller.

782
01:23:08,770 --> 01:23:11,520
Didn't you sign when you
opened the account?

783
01:23:11,690 --> 01:23:14,320
Tell her Carl Bruner did it by phone.

784
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:18,440
Carl Bruner opened that account
for me by phone,

785
01:23:18,650 --> 01:23:21,780
and he's asked me to come in today.

786
01:23:22,990 --> 01:23:25,450
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

787
01:23:27,450 --> 01:23:31,370
Just sign this card
on the bottom line, please.

788
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:34,750
May I use your pen?

789
01:23:39,970 --> 01:23:42,640
No! Rita Miller!

790
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:45,470
I'm so sorry.

791
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:48,430
I need another one.
I signed the wrong name.

792
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:59,240
Tell her to send it up to the third floor
file, you have a transaction to make.

793
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:04,660
Make sure this goes to the third floor,
I have a transfusion to make.

794
01:24:05,490 --> 01:24:06,700
Let's go.

795
01:24:06,870 --> 01:24:09,620
You know what I mean... !
Can I keep this pen?

796
01:24:09,790 --> 01:24:14,580
- Yes, sure.
- Thank you so much.

797
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:18,960
Bye-bye. I love these pens.

798
01:24:20,380 --> 01:24:22,090
What do you want to keep the pen for?

799
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:27,470
Carl Bruner speaking. Mr Balistrari?

800
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:30,020
Balistrari? lt's me, John.

801
01:24:30,220 --> 01:24:32,520
John... Sorry!

802
01:24:32,730 --> 01:24:34,980
What's up?

803
01:24:35,150 --> 01:24:37,230
I're got the info
on the Bradley portfolio.

804
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:42,700
- I'll pick it up later, all right?
- I'll be here till six.

805
01:24:48,370 --> 01:24:51,450
I couldn't talk you into losing the hat?

806
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:55,540
Keep messing with me,
you'll be here by yourself.

807
01:24:55,710 --> 01:25:00,710
You're here to see Lyle Ferguson.

808
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:04,720
- I'm here to see Lyle Ferguson.
- Do you have an appointment?

809
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:07,850
- No, l'm here for my health.
- Tell him Rita Miller's here!

810
01:25:08,010 --> 01:25:12,430
- Tell him Rita Miller's here.
- Just one moment, please.

811
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:15,100
- Don't embellish.
- Jawohl!

812
01:25:15,270 --> 01:25:17,440
Excuse me?

813
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:23,070
This guy Ferguson is a real jerk.

814
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:26,160
I're known him five years.

815
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:30,280
- Why are you whispering?
- Just listen!

816
01:25:30,450 --> 01:25:33,290
He's a social moron,
you're got nothing to worry about.

817
01:25:33,450 --> 01:25:40,710
Tell the guard Ferguson knows you,
from the Brewster's Christmas party.

818
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:42,920
What is this in regards to?

819
01:25:43,090 --> 01:25:48,220
He doesn't remember me? We spent
time at the Brewster's, last Christmas.

820
01:25:48,390 --> 01:25:54,310
He and his lovely wife, Shirley. It was
beautiful. A big old tree and presents...

821
01:25:57,770 --> 01:26:00,480
Gas!

822
01:26:00,650 --> 01:26:04,280
I get a little gas from time to time.

823
01:26:05,740 --> 01:26:09,870
- Quit poking me!
- Well, don't overdo it!

824
01:26:10,030 --> 01:26:15,960
Ferguson was so drunk, he could're
met Tina Turner and not remember.

825
01:26:22,420 --> 01:26:24,380
Here we go!

826
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:29,590
Hello.

827
01:26:31,430 --> 01:26:34,890
Of course.
Well, it's been a long time.

828
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:37,730
- Oh, a long time.
- Ask about Bobby and Snooky.

829
01:26:37,890 --> 01:26:42,440
- How are Bobby and Snooky?
- Fine... fine.

830
01:26:42,610 --> 01:26:45,400
Thank you for asking.

831
01:26:45,570 --> 01:26:48,820
And how is your...

832
01:26:48,990 --> 01:26:51,660
- ..family?
- Oh, couldn't be better.

833
01:26:51,870 --> 01:26:54,790
Well, wonderful.

834
01:26:54,950 --> 01:26:57,960
Ask how they did
on the Gibraltar Securities.

835
01:26:58,120 --> 01:27:02,210
I was wondering, how did you do
on the Gibraltar Securities?

836
01:27:02,380 --> 01:27:07,760
Gibraltar Securities? Well, it looks like
we topped out on that one.

837
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:11,510
- We sure did.
- That was a very useful tip.

838
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:14,140
Good old Randy.

839
01:27:14,350 --> 01:27:16,930
Got a good head
on his shoulders... her shoulders.

840
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:19,690
- Her shoulders.
- Randy.

841
01:27:20,810 --> 01:27:25,320
So, what brings you here today?

842
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:26,780
I'm closing an account.

843
01:27:26,940 --> 01:27:29,530
Do you have your account number?

844
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:32,910
- Yes? Yes.
- 926-31 043.

845
01:27:33,070 --> 01:27:34,370
926...

846
01:27:34,530 --> 01:27:39,000
..31 043. Is that right?

847
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:52,720
Well, Rita - it looks like you'll be
withdrawing four million dollars.

848
01:27:52,890 --> 01:27:56,060
- Four million dollars!
- Say yes.

849
01:27:56,220 --> 01:27:58,390
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

850
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:04,150
Yes. That's correct.

851
01:28:07,530 --> 01:28:11,450
- How would you like that?
- Tens and twenties.

852
01:28:11,610 --> 01:28:13,780
- Pardon?
- Tell him a cashier's cheque.

853
01:28:13,950 --> 01:28:18,580
- A cashier's cheque.
- Cashier's cheque. Fine!

854
01:28:18,790 --> 01:28:22,920
Of course, you know
we require identification.

855
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:27,420
It's a procedural thing.

856
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:41,430
Thank you. I'll be right back.

857
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,940
Four million dollars!

858
01:28:51,030 --> 01:28:54,950
Get me the First lsland Bank
of Nassau. It's on the Rolodex.

859
01:29:04,710 --> 01:29:08,170
Now, we have some things
for you to sign here.

860
01:29:08,340 --> 01:29:13,920
This officially closes the account.

861
01:29:14,090 --> 01:29:16,010
Sign "Rita Miller."

862
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:20,850
Miller - that's my name.

863
01:29:21,020 --> 01:29:23,430
My name - Rita Miller.

864
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:24,810
My name.

865
01:29:29,690 --> 01:29:32,820
I'll be right back.

866
01:29:32,990 --> 01:29:36,990
- Just anywhere?
- Right here.

867
01:29:41,370 --> 01:29:42,700
Fine.

868
01:29:42,870 --> 01:29:46,170
The cheque...

869
01:29:46,330 --> 01:29:49,590
..here you are.

870
01:29:58,550 --> 01:30:01,180
Mama took the money
from the oil wells,

871
01:30:01,390 --> 01:30:05,020
and she sunk it into gas pumps.

872
01:30:05,230 --> 01:30:09,020
And those gas stations have five
or six of those things, so it's lucrative.

873
01:30:09,230 --> 01:30:12,980
- Oda Mae, we're got to go.
- Got to go now.

874
01:30:13,150 --> 01:30:17,570
It's been a pleasure doing business.
May I keep the pen?

875
01:30:18,530 --> 01:30:20,740
Say goodnight to Bobby
and Snooky for me.

876
01:30:20,910 --> 01:30:22,700
Bye-bye.

877
01:30:28,580 --> 01:30:30,580
What is wrong?

878
01:30:40,050 --> 01:30:42,850
Excuse me - Lyle?

879
01:30:43,010 --> 01:30:44,520
Molly Jensen.

880
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:49,020
The woman you were doing business
with. What did she want?

881
01:30:49,190 --> 01:30:52,310
Did it have anything to do
with me or Sam?

882
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:56,610
- Sam? No.
- That was Oda Mae Brown, right?

883
01:30:56,780 --> 01:31:01,070
Her name was Rita Miller.
She was closing an account.

884
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:03,990
Is there a problem?

885
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:06,790
No. I guess not.

886
01:31:37,150 --> 01:31:39,950
Carl? ls something wrong?

887
01:31:40,110 --> 01:31:43,280
Did somebody play
with the computers?

888
01:31:43,450 --> 01:31:46,830
- One of my accounts is closed.
- What's wrong?

889
01:31:46,990 --> 01:31:52,880
- Do you want me to call someone?
- It's OK.

890
01:31:56,340 --> 01:31:59,920
Four million dollars! What am I
going to do with this money?

891
01:32:00,090 --> 01:32:03,010
I'm going to buy the building.
No, l'll buy the block.

892
01:32:03,180 --> 01:32:08,270
I'm going to make
my sister go to a fat farm.

893
01:32:08,430 --> 01:32:12,480
Wait, Oda Mae.
Take the cheque out of your purse.

894
01:32:12,690 --> 01:32:16,480
You're right, l'll put it
where nobody can get it.

895
01:32:16,690 --> 01:32:19,150
No. Endorse it.

896
01:32:20,070 --> 01:32:22,610
No, if I drop it,
then somebody will get it.

897
01:32:22,780 --> 01:32:26,700
It's not yours.
I never said you would get the money.

898
01:32:27,660 --> 01:32:32,500
This is blood money. I was killed
for this money. Endorse the cheque.

899
01:32:32,670 --> 01:32:36,840
- What are you going to do with it?
- Look over there.

900
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:39,510
To your left.

901
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:47,010
You don't think l'm giving this
to a bunch of nuns?

902
01:32:47,180 --> 01:32:51,350
Otherwise they will track you down.
Your only protection is to get rid of it.

903
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:54,100
You're kidding me!

904
01:32:54,270 --> 01:32:57,020
You'll go to heaven!

905
01:32:57,190 --> 01:33:00,530
I want to go to a bank
and cash this cheque.

906
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:07,910
- Hello.
- You'll thank me later.

907
01:33:10,370 --> 01:33:13,290
- Endorse it "Rita Miller."
- I know!

908
01:33:13,460 --> 01:33:15,790
Make it out to St Joseph's Shelter.

909
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:19,040
I don't believe
you're making me do this!

910
01:33:24,260 --> 01:33:27,600
- Give it to her.
- I just want to feel it in my fingers.

911
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:31,140
- Just give her the cheque!
- I will!

912
01:33:38,270 --> 01:33:41,570
- Give her the cheque!
- I will!

913
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:47,910
Bless you, child. Bless you.

914
01:33:53,250 --> 01:33:54,660
Give it to her.

915
01:33:55,370 --> 01:33:57,670
Let go. Let go!

916
01:34:04,970 --> 01:34:09,350
- I'm proud of you.
- I don't care. Stay away from me!

917
01:34:09,510 --> 01:34:12,810
What'll that nun do with it?
She can't go buy underwear!

918
01:34:12,970 --> 01:34:15,810
Leave me alone!
Never talk to me again.

919
01:34:15,980 --> 01:34:17,810
You're wonderful, Oda Mae!

920
01:34:53,970 --> 01:34:57,180
Go ahead, search! You'll never find it.

921
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:04,360
They're going to kill you and Willie.
You're going to be fertiliser.

922
01:35:04,530 --> 01:35:07,780
They're going to bury you
next to Jimmy Hoffa.

923
01:35:51,570 --> 01:35:53,870
Who's doing that?

924
01:35:54,070 --> 01:35:56,700
Who's doing that?

925
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:16,310
Hi. Where were you?
I thought we were having dinner.

926
01:36:16,470 --> 01:36:20,230
- Things got a little crazy, I forgot.
- A little trouble at the bank.

927
01:36:20,390 --> 01:36:25,650
I wish you're have called.
I're been worried.

928
01:36:25,810 --> 01:36:30,400
- I're got to ask you about something.
- He needs to borrow $4,000,000.

929
01:36:30,610 --> 01:36:35,030
When you said you thought
Sam was talking to you,

930
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:38,740
- what did he say to you?
- Why?

931
01:36:38,910 --> 01:36:44,000
Listen, I want to know exactly what
this psychic lady told you.

932
01:36:44,170 --> 01:36:46,670
Carl, let me go! Stop this!

933
01:36:49,460 --> 01:36:53,550
It doesn't matter. It wasn't real.

934
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:56,300
What the hell's happened to you?

935
01:36:56,470 --> 01:36:59,970
Does this have anything to do
with her being at the bank today?

936
01:37:02,850 --> 01:37:05,020
At the bank?

937
01:37:05,190 --> 01:37:08,020
Ferguson said she closed an account.

938
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:13,700
Her name isn't even Oda Mae Brown.
It's Rita Miller.

939
01:37:16,820 --> 01:37:19,450
Carl. Are you all right?

940
01:37:21,370 --> 01:37:22,960
It's just my stomach.

941
01:37:27,460 --> 01:37:30,550
Do you have some Pepto-Bismol?

942
01:37:30,710 --> 01:37:35,180
- Cyanide.
- It's upstairs. Sit down, l'll get it.

943
01:37:41,430 --> 01:37:45,560
What's wrong?
Does little Carl have a tummy ache?

944
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:54,700
Now do you believe in ghosts?

945
01:37:58,370 --> 01:38:00,530
I'll set the place on fire!

946
01:38:08,540 --> 01:38:10,880
- I'll cut her throat.
- Carl!

947
01:38:12,550 --> 01:38:17,340
I swear to God. I'll cut her throat.

948
01:38:18,890 --> 01:38:22,350
I need that money.
I want it tonight, at 1 1 o'lock.

949
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:27,520
If that psychic lady does not
bring it here, Molly is dead, OK?

950
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:30,190
Carl, who are you talking to?

951
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:33,610
Nothing. Molly, I have to go.

952
01:38:33,780 --> 01:38:36,990
I can't explain it now,
but there's a problem at the bank.

953
01:38:37,150 --> 01:38:41,080
- You're scaring me.
- I can't talk now, l'll be back.

954
01:38:41,240 --> 01:38:43,620
- Why not now?
- I can't talk now.

955
01:38:43,790 --> 01:38:50,000
I'll come back at 1 1 o'lock, OK?
l'm sorry, but it's really important.

956
01:38:50,170 --> 01:38:51,670
- Eleven!
- Oda Mae!

957
01:38:55,630 --> 01:39:00,800
I'm Arsenio Hall. Don't try
to adjust your television. I'm black.

958
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:05,720
- I want to watch "Love Connection."
- I love "Love Connection."

959
01:39:05,890 --> 01:39:08,560
Leave that! That's Arsenio.

960
01:39:08,730 --> 01:39:11,810
You love "Love Connection,"
send your picture in.

961
01:39:11,980 --> 01:39:15,360
- She did!
- They just haven't answered yet.

962
01:39:15,530 --> 01:39:18,490
- Oda Mae!
- Sam?

963
01:39:18,650 --> 01:39:21,660
We're in trouble.
They want the cheque.

964
01:39:21,820 --> 01:39:26,160
The cheque you said
they would never know about?

965
01:39:26,330 --> 01:39:28,500
- What's happening?
- They're here!

966
01:39:28,660 --> 01:39:31,210
Get out of here, now! Go, go!

967
01:39:43,430 --> 01:39:45,640
Knock on the doors!

968
01:39:45,810 --> 01:39:47,930
Help!

969
01:39:48,140 --> 01:39:51,770
- Let us in!
- Who are you kidding?

970
01:40:02,360 --> 01:40:07,040
What are you doing?
The cat don't like visitors.

971
01:40:16,590 --> 01:40:20,550
They're going to get us. Where's Sam?

972
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:24,600
- It looks like the bitch just left.
- I'll check downstairs.

973
01:40:36,020 --> 01:40:37,400
Carl?

974
01:41:27,450 --> 01:41:28,700
Willie!

975
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,880
You're got a serious problem, man.

976
01:42:02,610 --> 01:42:05,700
Help me! Help!

977
01:43:02,170 --> 01:43:04,460
That dude is dead.

978
01:43:09,430 --> 01:43:10,890
You're dead, Willie.

979
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:44,550
Help me!

980
01:44:05,270 --> 01:44:07,610
Tell the driver to hurry.

981
01:44:07,780 --> 01:44:12,870
- Can you step on it, please.
- I'm driving as fast as I can.

982
01:44:20,500 --> 01:44:21,710
Problems?

983
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:32,590
- Carl, is that you?
- It's me, Oda Mae.

984
01:44:32,760 --> 01:44:38,140
I know what you think of me, but we're
got to talk. You are in serious danger.

985
01:44:38,890 --> 01:44:42,940
- I're got Sam here with me.
- Get the hell out of here!

986
01:44:43,100 --> 01:44:45,980
- Im calling the police!
- Good. Tell her to do it!

987
01:44:46,150 --> 01:44:51,150
Fine. We want you to call the police.
But you're got to let us in.

988
01:44:52,110 --> 01:44:56,580
Don't you get it? Sam wasn't
accidentally killed, he was murdered.

989
01:44:56,740 --> 01:44:59,540
He found out
that Carl was laundering money.

990
01:44:59,700 --> 01:45:02,620
Carl is dangerous. He tried to kill me.

991
01:45:02,790 --> 01:45:07,090
He's going to try to kill you, too.
You are in deep, deep trouble.

992
01:45:07,290 --> 01:45:12,720
Why are you doing this to me?
Do you hear me?

993
01:45:12,930 --> 01:45:17,260
Why are you doing this to me?

994
01:45:18,140 --> 01:45:23,730
Oda Mae. Tell her she's wearing
the shirt that I spilt the margarita on,

995
01:45:23,890 --> 01:45:26,900
and the earrings
I gave her for Christmas.

996
01:45:27,110 --> 01:45:31,070
Sam says you're wearing the shirt
he spilt the margarita on,

997
01:45:31,240 --> 01:45:34,610
and the earrings
he gave you for Christmas.

998
01:45:39,950 --> 01:45:43,330
Don't you see?
l'm not a fake! Not about this.

999
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:51,130
- Give me a penny.
- What?

1000
01:45:51,340 --> 01:45:57,640
- Push a penny under the door, now!
- What are you talking about?

1001
01:46:34,130 --> 01:46:37,890
- Tell her it's for luck.
- Sam says it's for luck.

1002
01:47:14,050 --> 01:47:16,090
Between Green and Mercer on Prince.

1003
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:19,470
It's the grey building
across from the post office.

1004
01:47:19,640 --> 01:47:23,810
Thanks, Sergeant. Please hurry!
We'll be waiting.

1005
01:47:23,970 --> 01:47:26,890
- They're on their way.
- Good.

1006
01:47:28,440 --> 01:47:32,110
- What do we do now?
- Just wait.

1007
01:47:42,160 --> 01:47:45,120
Is Sam here?

1008
01:47:45,290 --> 01:47:47,750
Sam?

1009
01:47:47,960 --> 01:47:51,000
I'm sitting beside her.

1010
01:47:51,170 --> 01:47:54,130
He's sitting right beside you.

1011
01:48:03,300 --> 01:48:05,600
Sam, can you feel me?

1012
01:48:06,970 --> 01:48:09,440
With all my heart.

1013
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:12,440
He says with all his heart.

1014
01:48:24,160 --> 01:48:28,580
I're give anything
if I could just touch you once more.

1015
01:48:31,620 --> 01:48:35,210
He says he wishes he was alive again,
so he could touch you.

1016
01:48:38,760 --> 01:48:40,220
Me, too.

1017
01:48:57,110 --> 01:49:01,070
OK. Look - you can use me.

1018
01:49:02,280 --> 01:49:04,910
- Use you?
- Use my body.

1019
01:49:05,070 --> 01:49:08,120
- Use your body?
- Quick, before I change my mind.

1020
01:52:17,180 --> 01:52:19,850
- Molly, are you home?
- Carl.

1021
01:52:21,230 --> 01:52:23,730
- Molly!
- Fire escape.

1022
01:52:30,650 --> 01:52:32,530
What's happening to me?

1023
01:52:36,540 --> 01:52:40,120
Molly?

1024
01:52:49,090 --> 01:52:50,670
Molly!

1025
01:53:05,770 --> 01:53:07,400
Come on!

1026
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:11,740
Look!

1027
01:53:13,030 --> 01:53:14,450
Let's go!

1028
01:53:25,080 --> 01:53:29,760
- Molly!
- Get away from us, Carl!

1029
01:53:32,090 --> 01:53:34,130
- Molly!
- You're just a liar.

1030
01:53:34,300 --> 01:53:37,810
This woman's a thief.
She's a con artist.

1031
01:53:37,970 --> 01:53:40,520
Why are you doing this?

1032
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:44,690
Stop!

1033
01:53:44,850 --> 01:53:47,650
Get away from us.
I're called the police.

1034
01:53:57,490 --> 01:53:59,790
Shit!

1035
01:54:01,290 --> 01:54:04,290
- Carl, why are you doing this?
- She's a thief!

1036
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:11,130
Just give me the cheque!

1037
01:54:18,180 --> 01:54:20,470
Stay out of this, Molly!

1038
01:54:20,680 --> 01:54:24,810
Get off me!

1039
01:54:28,650 --> 01:54:30,610
Where is it?

1040
01:54:30,820 --> 01:54:33,780
- Where is it, goddammit?
- I gave it away.

1041
01:54:33,990 --> 01:54:38,490
You're lying to me.
Don't lie to me, goddammit.

1042
01:54:40,740 --> 01:54:42,450
The cheque!

1043
01:54:54,760 --> 01:54:58,510
I'll kill her, Sam.
I swear to God, l'll kill her!

1044
01:55:08,150 --> 01:55:11,020
Just give me the cheque, Sam.

1045
01:55:11,230 --> 01:55:16,860
I promise you l'll let her go
if you just give it to me.

1046
01:56:38,440 --> 01:56:39,860
Sam?

1047
01:56:42,280 --> 01:56:43,950
Oh, Carl...

1048
01:56:44,120 --> 01:56:46,160
What?

1049
01:57:53,480 --> 01:57:55,980
Are you two all right?

1050
01:57:59,150 --> 01:58:01,440
Sam?

1051
01:58:03,200 --> 01:58:05,200
Molly?

1052
01:58:06,990 --> 01:58:09,370
I can hear you!

1053
01:58:45,030 --> 01:58:46,820
Oh, God!

1054
01:59:34,330 --> 01:59:35,960
Sam?

1055
01:59:36,710 --> 01:59:39,750
They're waiting for you.

1056
01:59:49,680 --> 01:59:52,810
I'll miss you.

1057
01:59:53,010 --> 01:59:54,810
Your mother're be proud.

1058
01:59:55,680 --> 02:00:00,310
I'm going to miss you too, Sam.
You're all right!

1059
02:00:01,940 --> 02:00:04,020
Bye, Oda Mae.

1060
02:00:04,820 --> 02:00:07,150
Bye, Sam.

1061
02:00:29,050 --> 02:00:31,390
I love you, Molly.

1062
02:00:33,100 --> 02:00:35,060
I're always loved you.

1063
02:00:41,900 --> 02:00:44,360
Ditto.

1064
02:01:04,340 --> 02:01:07,210
It's amazing, Molly.

1065
02:01:07,420 --> 02:01:11,550
The love inside - you take it with you.

1066
02:01:22,980 --> 02:01:24,980
See you.

1067
02:01:31,860 --> 02:01:33,860
See you.

1068
02:01:52,090 --> 02:01:53,300
Bye.

1069
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:00,700


1070
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:00,700


1071
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:00,700
