1
00:02:47,718 --> 00:02:50,220
- Oh, this is great!
- Wow!

2
00:02:50,429 --> 00:02:55,142
Oh, that's incredible. There's
got to be seven or eight feet up there.

3
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:59,188
- And eighty years of dust.
- Oh, look at all this height.

4
00:02:59,355 --> 00:03:02,191
We could put our bedroom upstairs,
and get all this space.

5
00:03:02,358 --> 00:03:05,402
- For what?
- Just space.

6
00:03:06,612 --> 00:03:08,072
One!

7
00:03:08,238 --> 00:03:09,823
Two!

8
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,576
Three!

9
00:03:12,785 --> 00:03:15,579
- And four?
- Come on.

10
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,332
And five?

11
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:24,922
- Watch, watch!
- God, this place is huge.

12
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:29,927
- It's beautiful.
- God!

13
00:03:30,094 --> 00:03:34,515
- You guys, it's absolutely incredible.
- Incredible.

14
00:03:34,682 --> 00:03:38,477
- A little paint.
- Sell it tomorrow, double your money.

15
00:03:38,644 --> 00:03:41,146
Carl, you're obsessed.

16
00:03:41,313 --> 00:03:42,773
A little bit.

17
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,566
Wow, look!

18
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:48,696
Hey, it's an lndian Head penny.

19
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:50,406
1 898.

20
00:03:53,283 --> 00:03:55,828
It's a good omen.

21
00:03:55,995 --> 00:03:57,997
You're the good omen.

22
00:04:01,834 --> 00:04:03,794
Oh, it's so great!

23
00:04:13,345 --> 00:04:17,224
I had Rose move your 3 o'clock
with Bob Kahan to 4 o'clock.

24
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:22,479
Gary Alan called. He has to see you
about the painting bids for the loft.

25
00:04:22,688 --> 00:04:25,983
3 o'clock is the only time
he can make it. Is that OK?

26
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,735
Sam?

27
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,698
- I'm sorry.
- Relax, man.

28
00:04:32,865 --> 00:04:35,159
You're not having brain surgery.

29
00:04:35,326 --> 00:04:38,912
Pitching these Japanese guys
makes me so nervous.

30
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:43,334
Sam, you're going to be great. OK?

31
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:49,381
What am I supposed to say? I can't
really tell them my Swedish girl joke.

32
00:04:49,548 --> 00:04:51,592
Great. Where did you get those?

33
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,095
Molly. What do you think?
Are they me?

34
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:58,223
- Oh, man. Look at that, a Testarossa.
- Wow...

35
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:01,060
- Ouch!
- Pay off your Mustang first.

36
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:14,073
How are you?
What did the doctor say?

37
00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:17,284
He said that it was contagious.
That it was really...

38
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:19,036
- No?
- Yeah.

39
00:05:19,203 --> 00:05:21,789
I shouldn't even be coming in today.

40
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,751
What about the rash?

41
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:27,044
The rash?

42
00:05:27,211 --> 00:05:30,547
The rash is also incredibly contagious.

43
00:05:30,714 --> 00:05:33,926
- He said they've both been spreading.
- No?

44
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:39,598
On your genitals again?

45
00:05:39,765 --> 00:05:43,310
Yeah, yeah, right on the genitals.

46
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:48,065
Basically everywhere.
He said that I shouldn't touch anyone.

47
00:05:48,273 --> 00:05:50,067
Excuse me, l'm sorry.

48
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:55,239
- You're sick!
- I know.

49
00:05:55,447 --> 00:05:57,074
- Morning, Paul.
- Morning, Carl.

50
00:05:57,241 --> 00:05:59,451
Save it, Paul.

51
00:05:59,618 --> 00:06:01,954
- Morning, Mr Wheat.
- Susie. You're looking good.

52
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:04,999
- Sam.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

53
00:06:07,543 --> 00:06:09,795
- Here it is.
- Thanks.

54
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,716
- Morning, Sam.
- Morning, Rose.

55
00:06:13,882 --> 00:06:16,844
- Listen, the Kobiashi people...
- They're already here.

56
00:06:17,011 --> 00:06:19,013
- They're early!
- I know.

57
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:21,515
- Come here!
- Andy Dillon called...

58
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:23,684
- How long have they been here?
- Ten minutes.

59
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:28,230
Andy Dillon called. He needs $900,000
transferred to Albany by ten.

60
00:06:28,397 --> 00:06:30,316
- By ten?
- Yes.

61
00:06:33,027 --> 00:06:35,112
- Carl?
- Yeah.

62
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:38,324
Carl...

63
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:42,828
Dillon needs 900,000 in Albany by ten.
Can you transfer it to his account?

64
00:06:42,995 --> 00:06:45,998
- Yes, but I need your MAC code.
- OK.

65
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:55,132
- Discretion, right?
- Got it.

66
00:06:55,299 --> 00:06:57,926
- You bet. I'll do it right now.
- Thanks.

67
00:06:58,093 --> 00:06:59,928
Bill, l'll call you back.

68
00:07:10,773 --> 00:07:12,399
OK, that's fine.

69
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:13,776
That's fine.

70
00:07:15,527 --> 00:07:17,363
This is too far out.

71
00:07:19,114 --> 00:07:20,824
Can you get this, man?

72
00:07:22,201 --> 00:07:26,288
Are you guys from
the New York City Ballet?

73
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,669
Almost...

74
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,549
- Saved your life!
- You shit.

75
00:07:37,716 --> 00:07:39,927
Why do you scare me to death?

76
00:07:40,094 --> 00:07:44,306
It's better than seeing this gorgeous
body splattered all over the place.

77
00:07:44,473 --> 00:07:45,766
Look out!

78
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:54,525
- Grab it!
- Sam, Moll! Are you guys home?

79
00:07:54,692 --> 00:07:56,443
- Did you invite Carl?
- Slave labour.

80
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,570
- Carl!
- Hurry, help!

81
00:07:58,737 --> 00:08:01,323
- Oh, my God.
- Grab the bottom.

82
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:05,035
- Now, go there.
- Here?

83
00:08:05,244 --> 00:08:08,080
- Right here?
- Watch your toes.

84
00:08:08,831 --> 00:08:13,669
- Where do you want this?
- In the bedroom.

85
00:08:13,836 --> 00:08:18,215
- God, this place looks great!
- You like it, huh?

86
00:08:18,382 --> 00:08:22,720
Like is hardly the word. I had no idea
it would be this beautiful. It's incredible.

87
00:08:22,886 --> 00:08:27,099
- What about her?
- Leave her until the other stuff is here.

88
00:08:27,266 --> 00:08:30,269
- What are these?
- Oh, let me show you.

89
00:08:30,436 --> 00:08:33,355
Will you help me lift this up?

90
00:08:35,858 --> 00:08:40,612
- Just finished it. What do you think?
- I love it.

91
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:44,116
Sam, what's this chair doing here?

92
00:08:44,283 --> 00:08:47,619
- I love that chair.
- I know, but we discussed this.

93
00:08:47,786 --> 00:08:50,039
I've had it forever.

94
00:08:50,205 --> 00:08:54,335
- When I watch TV, I sit in it.
- This chair is ugly.

95
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:58,589
- And it doesn't go with anything.
- It goes with me.

96
00:08:58,756 --> 00:09:01,717
You're right, it does.

97
00:09:01,884 --> 00:09:04,720
- We'll paint it.
- We'll what?

98
00:09:13,896 --> 00:09:16,231
Are you OK?

99
00:09:16,398 --> 00:09:18,317
I'm fine.

100
00:09:21,195 --> 00:09:23,781
What's the matter?

101
00:09:23,947 --> 00:09:25,783
Nothing.

102
00:09:29,078 --> 00:09:33,374
Are you worried about the promotion?

103
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,501
No, not really.

104
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:47,429
Then what - moving in together?

105
00:09:48,263 --> 00:09:50,432
No.

106
00:09:53,602 --> 00:09:56,897
I don't know. It's a lot of things.

107
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,862
I just don't want the bubble to burst.

108
00:10:06,281 --> 00:10:08,325
It seems like...

109
00:10:09,994 --> 00:10:15,874
..whenever anything good in my life
happens, l'm afraid l'm going to lose it.

110
00:10:20,337 --> 00:10:23,090
I love you.

111
00:10:23,257 --> 00:10:26,051
I really love you.

112
00:10:28,053 --> 00:10:29,638
Ditto.

113
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:39,440
The pilot's first report of trouble was
he blew the number two engine...

114
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:42,735
Oh, Jesus. Another one?

115
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:47,364
Don't watch that.

116
00:10:47,573 --> 00:10:52,828
I should cancel my LA trip.
These things always happen in threes.

117
00:10:52,995 --> 00:10:55,080
Sam, get serious!

118
00:10:55,247 --> 00:10:59,585
- Besides, you lead a charmed life.
- Yeah, so did they.

119
00:11:01,545 --> 00:11:04,214
It's amazing. Just like that...

120
00:11:04,381 --> 00:11:06,258
Blackout.

121
00:12:13,492 --> 00:12:16,161
What are you doing?

122
00:12:16,328 --> 00:12:18,372
I couldn't sleep.

123
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,668
Boy...

124
00:12:22,835 --> 00:12:25,004
I really must have passed out.

125
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:29,008
- What time is it?
- It's 2 am.

126
00:12:52,865 --> 00:12:54,074
Oh, no!

127
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:57,036
I hope it wasn't a masterpiece.

128
00:12:57,202 --> 00:12:59,496
Well, it's not now.

129
00:13:01,123 --> 00:13:03,208
- Can I help?
- Yeah.

130
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:06,295
Put your hands here...
Now get them wet.

131
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:12,092
Let the clay slide between your fingers.

132
00:16:05,641 --> 00:16:08,644
Oh, no.

133
00:16:08,811 --> 00:16:12,940
- What's the matter?
- A glitch. What's up?

134
00:16:13,107 --> 00:16:16,819
The Greenberg and White accounts,
I can't get in. The code doesn't work.

135
00:16:16,986 --> 00:16:19,321
- I changed it.
- Why?

136
00:16:19,488 --> 00:16:25,244
- I just want to nose around a bit.
- Is something wrong?

137
00:16:25,411 --> 00:16:26,662
Can you keep a secret?

138
00:16:28,747 --> 00:16:31,709
Yeah, sure. What's up?

139
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:34,086
There's too much money
in these accounts.

140
00:16:34,253 --> 00:16:37,006
That's impossible.

141
00:16:42,052 --> 00:16:45,764
Sam, this is going to take you hours.
Let me do this.

142
00:16:45,931 --> 00:16:49,977
- It already has taken me hours.
- Let me figure it out for you.

143
00:16:50,144 --> 00:16:52,730
No, it's OK. It's like a vendetta now.

144
00:16:53,772 --> 00:16:56,608
Thanks, though, I appreciate it.

145
00:16:56,775 --> 00:17:00,612
- If you start to go blind, give a shout.
- OK. Adis.

146
00:17:01,613 --> 00:17:04,908
Listen, what are you and Moll
doing tonight?

147
00:17:05,075 --> 00:17:08,162
We're going to the theatre.
She wants to see Macbeth.

148
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:10,831
I think she likes the guys in tights.

149
00:17:10,998 --> 00:17:14,418
- You want to go?
- No. I want a full report, though.

150
00:17:15,002 --> 00:17:16,879
- Later.
- Yeah.

151
00:17:22,468 --> 00:17:26,138
Well, I loved it.
I was spellbound the whole time.

152
00:17:26,305 --> 00:17:31,977
I could tell, and so could the rest of
the audience, with that snore of yours.

153
00:17:37,566 --> 00:17:41,236
- Did I tell you what Marcia said?
- About six times.

154
00:17:41,403 --> 00:17:45,491
It wasn't six times.
Quit being so blas?about this.

155
00:17:45,658 --> 00:17:49,203
This was really important. I'm going
to have two pieces in her gallery.

156
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:52,998
The New York Times
reviews her gallery all the time.

157
00:17:53,165 --> 00:17:57,294
The New York Times is a frustrated
critic with pimples on his ass

158
00:17:57,461 --> 00:18:01,215
who flunked art school.
Who cares what they think?

159
00:18:01,382 --> 00:18:04,051
About 8 million readers, that's who.

160
00:18:04,218 --> 00:18:07,930
No, they're just reading
the sports page.

161
00:18:08,097 --> 00:18:12,267
Your work is really beautiful.
It really is.

162
00:18:12,434 --> 00:18:16,939
It shouldn't matter what anyone else
thinks, just what I think.

163
00:18:21,735 --> 00:18:24,697
- I want to marry you, Sam.
- What?

164
00:18:26,907 --> 00:18:31,829
- What?
- Yeah, l've been thinking about it.

165
00:18:31,996 --> 00:18:34,707
I've been thinking about it a lot.

166
00:18:34,873 --> 00:18:37,376
I think we should just do it.

167
00:18:38,002 --> 00:18:41,588
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

168
00:18:44,717 --> 00:18:47,469
What's that look for?

169
00:18:50,973 --> 00:18:54,184
You never wanted to talk about it.

170
00:19:03,736 --> 00:19:09,908
- Do you love me, Sam?
- What do you think?

171
00:19:10,075 --> 00:19:13,203
- Why don't you ever say it?
- What do you mean?

172
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:18,500
- I say it all the time.
- You say 创ditto.创 That's not the same.

173
00:19:20,878 --> 00:19:25,549
People say 创l love you创 all the time,
and it doesn't mean anything.

174
00:19:29,261 --> 00:19:32,097
Sometimes you need to hear it.

175
00:19:32,931 --> 00:19:35,809
I need to hear it.

176
00:19:35,976 --> 00:19:37,770
Let's go!

177
00:19:46,195 --> 00:19:48,781
- What should we do?
- Let me handle it.

178
00:19:48,947 --> 00:19:51,075
- What do you want?
- Your wallet!

179
00:19:52,284 --> 00:19:55,204
Sam, just give it to him.

180
00:19:56,622 --> 00:19:59,750
Just take the money. Just leave...

181
00:19:59,917 --> 00:20:01,543
No! Sam!

182
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,837
You son of a bitch!

183
00:20:08,801 --> 00:20:10,761
Somebody help us!

184
00:20:15,432 --> 00:20:19,728
Somebody! Somebody help us!

185
00:20:22,231 --> 00:20:25,484
Stop it, Sam!

186
00:20:46,005 --> 00:20:47,840
Molly?

187
00:20:49,633 --> 00:20:51,510
Molly! You got...?

188
00:21:03,355 --> 00:21:07,985
Oh, baby, hold on.
You're going to be OK.

189
00:21:09,945 --> 00:21:13,032
Somebody? Somebody!

190
00:21:13,198 --> 00:21:16,660
Somebody help us!

191
00:21:18,412 --> 00:21:23,375
Oh, my God!
Oh, Sam, come on. Come on, baby.

192
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:29,340
You're going to be OK.

193
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:42,811
Somebody? Somebody help me!

194
00:21:42,978 --> 00:21:47,358
Please, anybody!

195
00:21:47,524 --> 00:21:52,029
OK, lady, take it easy.
We'll help you.

196
00:21:52,237 --> 00:21:54,740
Molly? Molly?

197
00:21:54,907 --> 00:21:57,117
Molly!

198
00:22:00,996 --> 00:22:04,541
What shall we do?

199
00:22:14,969 --> 00:22:18,430
What's happening? What's...

200
00:22:18,597 --> 00:22:19,932
Is he breathing?

201
00:22:27,773 --> 00:22:30,109
Oh, goddamn, hold on.

202
00:22:53,132 --> 00:22:56,135
Here we go.

203
00:23:00,389 --> 00:23:04,310
Sam, don't you leave me! Hold on!

204
00:23:57,154 --> 00:24:00,282
If you would just step this way.

205
00:24:17,341 --> 00:24:22,054
- So, what happened to you?
- What?

206
00:24:22,221 --> 00:24:23,973
You're new, huh? I can tell.

207
00:24:25,224 --> 00:24:28,143
- Are you talking to me?
- Relax, it ain't like before.

208
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,688
It's a whole new ball of wax.

209
00:24:31,855 --> 00:24:33,691
- Who are you?
- I'm waiting for my wife.

210
00:24:33,857 --> 00:24:37,945
She's in the cardiac wing.
She's fighting it.

211
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:49,707
Shot? That'll do it every time.

212
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:52,710
Poor bastard.

213
00:24:52,876 --> 00:24:57,506
You may as well get used to it -
you could be here for a long while.

214
00:25:01,927 --> 00:25:06,140
I'll tell you a secret.
Doors ain't as bad as you think.

215
00:25:06,307 --> 00:25:10,394
Zip-zap - ain't nothing at all.
You'll see. You'll catch on.

216
00:25:15,065 --> 00:25:20,487
He ain't going to make it. I've seen it
a million times - he's a goner.

217
00:25:25,409 --> 00:25:28,370
You see? Here they come.

218
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:36,754
Lucky bastard!
It could have been the other ones.

219
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,089
You never know.

220
00:25:59,443 --> 00:26:01,320
Who are they?

221
00:26:05,991 --> 00:26:07,785
No!

222
00:26:15,501 --> 00:26:17,836
God help me!

223
00:26:19,088 --> 00:26:21,465
Help me!

224
00:26:27,471 --> 00:26:32,601
创l am sunk in the abysmal swamp
where there is no foothold.

225
00:26:32,768 --> 00:26:38,524
创l have reached the watery depths.
The flood overwhelms me.

226
00:26:38,691 --> 00:26:41,860
创l am wearied with calling.创

227
00:26:42,027 --> 00:26:46,323
As we say farewell to our friend,
Sam Wheat,

228
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:49,451
we are reminded of his kindness,

229
00:26:49,618 --> 00:26:51,996
his generosity,

230
00:26:52,162 --> 00:26:55,374
his buoyancy of spirit.

231
00:26:55,541 --> 00:26:57,543
All that we treasure,

232
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:03,132
our loved ones,
our friends, our body...

233
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:05,551
..our mind,

234
00:27:05,718 --> 00:27:11,265
are but on loan to us.
We must surrender them all.

235
00:27:11,432 --> 00:27:16,895
We are all travellers on the same road,
which leads to the same end.

236
00:27:20,816 --> 00:27:23,861
As our loved one enters eternal life,

237
00:27:24,069 --> 00:27:27,406
Iet us remember
that love, too, is eternal.

238
00:27:28,657 --> 00:27:33,078
That although we will miss him,
our love will light the void

239
00:27:33,245 --> 00:27:35,789
and dispel the darkness.

240
00:28:14,828 --> 00:28:17,539
I picked up your shirts today.

241
00:28:19,124 --> 00:28:22,461
I don't know why.

242
00:28:25,172 --> 00:28:28,384
Mr Reynolds told me to tell you 创hello.创

243
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:33,806
I broke into tears.

244
00:28:36,475 --> 00:28:39,770
It's like I think about you every minute.

245
00:28:39,937 --> 00:28:42,606
It's like I can still feel you.

246
00:28:52,658 --> 00:28:54,493
I'm here, Moll.

247
00:29:03,127 --> 00:29:05,421
What's the matter, kitty?

248
00:29:05,587 --> 00:29:08,215
What's the matter?

249
00:29:08,382 --> 00:29:10,634
Crazy cat.

250
00:29:14,221 --> 00:29:15,973
Sam?

251
00:29:18,142 --> 00:29:20,394
It's really stupid.

252
00:29:31,822 --> 00:29:33,866
I love this picture.

253
00:29:34,033 --> 00:29:36,994
It's great. Office.

254
00:29:46,211 --> 00:29:48,756
Let me see that!

255
00:29:48,922 --> 00:29:51,383
Sam's address book.

256
00:29:57,681 --> 00:30:01,685
- Dave Brubeck, should I toss them?
- No.

257
00:30:01,852 --> 00:30:04,605
No? Molly, we hated that concert.

258
00:30:07,316 --> 00:30:09,693
You wanted to save those?

259
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:13,739
Rolaids? Molly, what are you doing?

260
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:25,334
I just miss him, Carl.

261
00:30:25,501 --> 00:30:27,336
Me, too.

262
00:30:29,922 --> 00:30:33,842
Carl? Wait a minute.

263
00:30:34,009 --> 00:30:36,553
Not that one.

264
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,599
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to put that on there.

265
00:30:40,766 --> 00:30:43,978
Hey, Moll. Why don't you come?

266
00:30:44,144 --> 00:30:48,440
- It's like summer outside.
- No. I'm really not up for it.

267
00:30:48,607 --> 00:30:52,444
- It would be good for you to get out.
- I don't want to.

268
00:30:52,611 --> 00:30:55,239
You can't stay in here all day.
It's not healthy.

269
00:30:55,447 --> 00:30:57,533
I can't do it!

270
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,703
You're not the one who died.

271
00:31:04,456 --> 00:31:07,334
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologise.

272
00:31:07,501 --> 00:31:09,461
Shit!

273
00:31:12,881 --> 00:31:17,803
- Maybe you're right. Just a short one.
- That a girl!

274
00:31:21,348 --> 00:31:22,933
I'm sorry.

275
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,977
Molly?

276
00:32:25,871 --> 00:32:28,457
What are you doing here?

277
00:32:28,624 --> 00:32:30,250
You bastard!

278
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:34,922
You son of a bitch!

279
00:32:51,397 --> 00:32:53,732
What do you want?

280
00:32:54,692 --> 00:32:56,568
Molly?

281
00:32:57,403 --> 00:32:59,363
Molly, get out!

282
00:33:05,744 --> 00:33:07,663
No, Molly!

283
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,873
No, please?

284
00:33:11,583 --> 00:33:13,919
He's got a gun, Molly!

285
00:33:14,086 --> 00:33:16,130
Hi, kitty.

286
00:33:17,381 --> 00:33:19,174
You hurt her, l'll...

287
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:47,453
Shit!

288
00:33:49,663 --> 00:33:53,292
Is somebody there?

289
00:33:54,793 --> 00:33:56,670
Hello?

290
00:35:14,164 --> 00:35:16,750
Let go! What are you doing?

291
00:35:21,171 --> 00:35:23,173
Like trains?

292
00:35:34,143 --> 00:35:35,853
Stay out! This is mine.

293
00:36:53,681 --> 00:36:55,474
Shit!

294
00:37:05,985 --> 00:37:08,779
It's me. I couldn't get it.

295
00:37:08,946 --> 00:37:11,240
She came home.

296
00:37:11,407 --> 00:37:14,118
Give me a couple of days. I'll go back.

297
00:37:15,035 --> 00:37:17,663
Relax. I'll get it.

298
00:37:19,331 --> 00:37:21,417
Get what?

299
00:37:23,377 --> 00:37:28,340
Who are you?
What do you want from us?

300
00:37:32,011 --> 00:37:35,973
No. You stay away from her!

301
00:37:37,433 --> 00:37:39,184
Do you hear me?

302
00:37:39,351 --> 00:37:41,603
You stay away from her!

303
00:38:43,874 --> 00:38:46,168
Rosa Santiago?

304
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,926
Please be seated.

305
00:39:09,274 --> 00:39:11,360
Our sister will be with us soon.

306
00:39:14,947 --> 00:39:16,573
Sister Oda Mae,

307
00:39:16,782 --> 00:39:20,786
grant us the gift
of your all-seeing presence.

308
00:39:20,953 --> 00:39:23,747
Appear before us now.

309
00:39:29,128 --> 00:39:30,629
Mrs Santiago?

310
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,134
- Buenos das.
- I'm Oda Mae Brown.

311
00:39:35,301 --> 00:39:40,139
You wish to contact your husband.
I believe he'll be with us today.

312
00:39:40,306 --> 00:39:42,433
Thank you.

313
00:39:43,475 --> 00:39:46,312
But you know, Mrs Santiago,

314
00:39:46,478 --> 00:39:49,356
there's no telling
about that other world,

315
00:39:49,523 --> 00:39:53,235
so you've got to be a believer.
Are you a believer?

316
00:39:53,402 --> 00:39:57,031
S? I believe, I believe.

317
00:39:57,197 --> 00:39:59,366
Then let us begin.

318
00:40:20,429 --> 00:40:22,931
I can't.

319
00:40:23,098 --> 00:40:24,600
It's too difficult.

320
00:40:24,767 --> 00:40:29,188
I just can't seem to make contact.
No - wait!

321
00:40:29,355 --> 00:40:32,399
I'm feeling something.

322
00:40:32,566 --> 00:40:38,155
Did he know someone
by the name of Anna?

323
00:40:38,364 --> 00:40:39,823
Consuelo?

324
00:40:40,866 --> 00:40:43,452
Lucita? Julietta?

325
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:46,038
Josephina? Linda? Maria?

326
00:40:46,747 --> 00:40:50,459
S? s? His Mama, she is Maria.

327
00:40:50,626 --> 00:40:54,713
Yes! Praise God.
I knew he was with his Mama.

328
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,632
Oh, my God...

329
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:07,142
It's too difficult. It's two of them -
I'm not sure I can do that.

330
00:41:07,309 --> 00:41:10,562
I pay more! How much?

331
00:41:10,729 --> 00:41:12,564
- How much?
- Twenty dollars.

332
00:41:12,731 --> 00:41:15,985
Way to go. Milk her for every penny.

333
00:41:32,793 --> 00:41:36,380
Yes. I believe we can start again.

334
00:41:50,769 --> 00:41:54,857
Praise the Lord! Thank you, Jesus.

335
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:16,211
Welcome, Mrs Santiago. You are
fortunate, the spirits are churning.

336
00:42:16,378 --> 00:42:18,714
- My husband?
- Mercy!

337
00:42:18,881 --> 00:42:20,382
Oh, yeah, where?

338
00:42:23,302 --> 00:42:26,889
- Julio?
- Yes.

339
00:42:27,056 --> 00:42:29,683
I feel his vibration.

340
00:42:32,811 --> 00:42:36,565
- I see him.
- How is he? How does he look?

341
00:42:36,732 --> 00:42:38,317
He's a handsome man.

342
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:42,488
Handsome?

343
00:42:42,655 --> 00:42:46,617
Mrs Santiago, in our Father's
Kingdom, we're all handsome.

344
00:42:46,825 --> 00:42:49,328
Oh, Julio.

345
00:42:49,495 --> 00:42:53,832
Julio is coming towards us.
I see him! He's coming.

346
00:42:54,667 --> 00:42:56,585
He's there.

347
00:42:59,254 --> 00:43:01,298
He's dressed in a black suit.

348
00:43:03,217 --> 00:43:06,178
Black suit?

349
00:43:06,345 --> 00:43:10,307
- Could be blue.
- What a crock of shit.

350
00:43:10,474 --> 00:43:12,643
Who is that?

351
00:43:12,851 --> 00:43:14,812
Where are you?

352
00:43:14,979 --> 00:43:17,314
Did you hear it?

353
00:43:17,481 --> 00:43:19,400
Where are you?

354
00:43:19,566 --> 00:43:21,652
- Who are you?
- Who?

355
00:43:23,195 --> 00:43:26,198
- You can hear me?
- Can't you hear him?

356
00:43:26,365 --> 00:43:30,869
I don't believe this. My name
is Sam Wheat. Can you hear me?

357
00:43:31,036 --> 00:43:35,666
- Say my name, 创Sam Wheat.创
- Leave me alone!

358
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:39,753
- Talk to me, Oda Mae.
- Sam Wheat.

359
00:43:42,673 --> 00:43:45,676
- Jesus... !
- Sam Wheat?

360
00:43:45,843 --> 00:43:50,806
I swear, no more cheating. I'll do
anything, just make that guy go away.

361
00:43:50,973 --> 00:43:52,516
No way.

362
00:44:00,649 --> 00:44:02,401
It's OK.

363
00:44:06,739 --> 00:44:11,744
- All right, sister?
- Yeah, you're all right.

364
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:15,789
My mother had it, and her mother.
They both had the gift.

365
00:44:15,956 --> 00:44:20,753
They always said I had it,
but I never did, I never had it.

366
00:44:20,919 --> 00:44:25,966
They told me all about it, but now that
l've got it, I don't think I want it.

367
00:44:26,133 --> 00:44:28,719
Just go away. Find somebody else.

368
00:44:28,927 --> 00:44:32,014
- You're out of your mind.
- I'm getting there fast.

369
00:44:32,181 --> 00:44:33,891
She hit her head hard.

370
00:44:34,099 --> 00:44:36,810
She was talking to somebody
before that.

371
00:44:36,977 --> 00:44:39,229
Sister can do that.

372
00:44:39,438 --> 00:44:43,275
- Where exactly are you?
- Standing right beside you.

373
00:44:43,442 --> 00:44:47,446
- You're standing right beside me?
- Honey, we're right here!

374
00:44:47,613 --> 00:44:50,032
- Are you white?
- What?

375
00:44:50,199 --> 00:44:52,952
- White?
- You're white, aren't you?

376
00:44:53,118 --> 00:44:55,871
- You know what?
- I'm calling the doctor.

377
00:44:56,038 --> 00:45:00,960
- I knew it, a white guy! Why me?
- You're going to help me.

378
00:45:01,126 --> 00:45:05,965
There's a woman who is in terrible
danger. The man who killed me

379
00:45:06,131 --> 00:45:10,386
is going back to our apartment.
You've got to warn her.

380
00:45:10,552 --> 00:45:15,474
- Why would she listen to me?
- It's just a phone call.

381
00:45:17,351 --> 00:45:18,978
Look...

382
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:26,610
..you're all l've got. I'm not leaving
until you help me.

383
00:45:26,777 --> 00:45:30,948
I don't care how long it takes,
because I can talk forever.

384
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:48,924
- Hello.
- Hi, is this Molly Jensen?

385
00:45:49,091 --> 00:45:52,803
My name is Oda Mae Brown,
l'm a spiritual advisor.

386
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:55,139
I have a message for you.

387
00:45:55,306 --> 00:46:01,312
It sounds crazy, but it's not. You've
got to believe me, don't be afraid.

388
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,606
- Who is this?
- I've got a message from Sam.

389
00:46:07,234 --> 00:46:11,030
- What?
- Sam Wheat asked me to call.

390
00:46:13,532 --> 00:46:15,659
- I told you!
- You've got to go there.

391
00:46:15,826 --> 00:46:18,621
I'm not going anywhere.

392
00:46:19,455 --> 00:46:21,749
Second verse, same as the first.

393
00:46:21,915 --> 00:46:26,879
I'm Henry the Eighth, I am
Henry the Eighth I am, I am

394
00:46:27,046 --> 00:46:32,509
I got married to the widow next door,
she's been married seven times before

395
00:46:40,059 --> 00:46:45,147
Henry the Eighth I am, I am
Henry the Eighth I am

396
00:46:45,314 --> 00:46:47,650
Second verse, same as the first

397
00:46:47,816 --> 00:46:52,571
I'm Henry the Eighth, I am
Henry the Eighth I am, I am

398
00:46:52,738 --> 00:46:57,076
- I got married to the widow next door.
- All right! Stop singing.

399
00:46:57,242 --> 00:47:01,664
I'll go anywhere you want to,
just don't sing any more.

400
00:47:08,253 --> 00:47:13,258
I can't believe l'm doing this. What
am I doing here? I hate downtown!

401
00:47:13,425 --> 00:47:18,138
She's probably not even there.
Where are you?

402
00:47:20,015 --> 00:47:21,684
Which building is it?

403
00:47:23,811 --> 00:47:25,771
Push 3.

404
00:47:27,064 --> 00:47:29,274
- See, nobody's there.
- Just wait.

405
00:47:29,441 --> 00:47:33,946
I did everything I said I would.
She's not there. I'm going.

406
00:47:34,113 --> 00:47:37,574
I'm sorry.

407
00:47:37,741 --> 00:47:40,369
All right, don't sing.

408
00:47:42,162 --> 00:47:44,665
- Hello?
- Hi... She can't hear you.

409
00:47:44,832 --> 00:47:50,629
I called you last night
about your friend, Sam Wheat.

410
00:47:50,796 --> 00:47:51,964
I told you!

411
00:47:59,138 --> 00:48:02,474
Hey, Molly. I know you're up there.

412
00:48:02,641 --> 00:48:05,894
I know you hear me.
Sam wants to talk to you.

413
00:48:06,061 --> 00:48:07,980
This is for real!

414
00:48:08,147 --> 00:48:11,275
Remember the starfish at Montego Bay?

415
00:48:11,442 --> 00:48:13,736
How would I know that?

416
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:18,282
I know about the underwear
you wrote your name on!

417
00:48:18,449 --> 00:48:20,492
I won't forget that.

418
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:24,371
I know about the picture in Reno.

419
00:48:24,538 --> 00:48:26,123
Hey, Molly!

420
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:32,171
The sweater she knitted,
in the closet, that's too big.

421
00:48:32,338 --> 00:48:37,468
He just told me about the sweater
that you knitted that's too big.

422
00:48:38,344 --> 00:48:40,679
Four sizes.

423
00:48:43,223 --> 00:48:45,309
- Do you hear me?
- I hear you!

424
00:48:45,476 --> 00:48:48,354
- Nobody's talking to you.
- Hear of the phone?

425
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,147
Want to kiss my butt?

426
00:48:51,065 --> 00:48:53,984
- I won't stay here all day.
- Thank God!

427
00:48:54,151 --> 00:48:56,028
Oh, shut up!

428
00:48:56,195 --> 00:49:00,699
Molly, l'm going to count to three,
and then l'm out of here.

429
00:49:00,866 --> 00:49:03,452
One-two-three.

430
00:49:03,619 --> 00:49:06,246
- No, wait.
- No.

431
00:49:06,413 --> 00:49:08,248
It's Molly.

432
00:49:14,546 --> 00:49:15,673
Molly?

433
00:49:18,884 --> 00:49:20,719
I'm Oda Mae Brown.

434
00:49:25,849 --> 00:49:29,019
I don't know you or Sam,
but let me tell you what he did.

435
00:49:29,228 --> 00:49:32,064
He kept me up all night singing
创l'm Henry the Eighth, I am.创

436
00:49:33,732 --> 00:49:37,069
That's how he got me
to go out with him.

437
00:49:37,236 --> 00:49:39,947
Look, l'm sorry.

438
00:49:40,114 --> 00:49:43,742
I just don't believe in this
life after death stuff.

439
00:49:43,909 --> 00:49:47,162
- Tell her she's wrong.
- He says you're wrong.

440
00:49:47,955 --> 00:49:50,207
- You're talking to him right now?
- Yeah.

441
00:49:50,374 --> 00:49:52,543
He asked me to tell you
that you're wrong.

442
00:49:53,502 --> 00:49:57,589
- Where is he?
- I can't see him, I can only hear him.

443
00:49:59,049 --> 00:50:02,428
- I'm right here.
- That doesn't help, Sam.

444
00:50:04,096 --> 00:50:07,933
- I'm holding her hand.
- He says he's holding your hand.

445
00:50:18,527 --> 00:50:23,240
What are you doing?
What do you think you're doing to me?

446
00:50:23,407 --> 00:50:26,452
If you think l'm here for my health,
you're crazy.

447
00:50:26,619 --> 00:50:29,455
Sam's dead. He's dead.

448
00:50:30,623 --> 00:50:32,458
- Tell her I love her.
- He says he loves you.

449
00:50:35,544 --> 00:50:37,588
Sam would never say that.

450
00:50:37,755 --> 00:50:40,090
- Tell her 创ditto.创
- What is 创ditto创?

451
00:50:40,257 --> 00:50:43,093
Ditto!

452
00:51:11,789 --> 00:51:14,959
I don't know how l'm doing this.

453
00:51:15,125 --> 00:51:20,506
Confidentially - nothing like this
has ever happened to me before.

454
00:51:20,673 --> 00:51:23,050
Now I can't turn it off.

455
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:28,305
- Is this him? ls this you?
- Yeah.

456
00:51:28,472 --> 00:51:31,892
Cute! White, but cute.

457
00:51:32,059 --> 00:51:35,104
What I don't understand is,
why did he come back?

458
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:38,357
- I don't know.
- Why's he still here?

459
00:51:38,524 --> 00:51:41,485
He's stuck, he's in between worlds.

460
00:51:41,652 --> 00:51:45,572
Sometimes the spirit
gets yanked out so quick,

461
00:51:45,739 --> 00:51:48,534
the essence still feels
it has work to do.

462
00:51:48,701 --> 00:51:52,579
- Stop rambling.
- I'm not, l'm answering a question.

463
00:51:52,746 --> 00:51:55,207
- He's got an attitude.
- I don't.

464
00:51:55,374 --> 00:51:58,377
Yes, you do.
We're having a little discussion.

465
00:51:58,544 --> 00:52:02,506
If you didn't, you wouldn't
have raised your voice.

466
00:52:02,715 --> 00:52:07,303
- Oh, goddammit...
- Don't take the Lord's name in vain.

467
00:52:07,469 --> 00:52:09,680
- Would you relax?
- You're the dead guy.

468
00:52:09,888 --> 00:52:12,558
If you want me to help,
youd better apologise.

469
00:52:12,725 --> 00:52:17,896
That's it, l'm leaving.
Nobody talks to me like that.

470
00:52:18,063 --> 00:52:23,485
- Now, youd better apologise.
- I'm sorry. I apologise. OK?

471
00:52:24,028 --> 00:52:26,822
Now would you sit down?

472
00:52:26,989 --> 00:52:29,742
- Please?
- He's apologised.

473
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:33,287
I need you to tell Molly
what l'm saying,

474
00:52:33,454 --> 00:52:37,666
but you have to tell her
word for word, all right?

475
00:52:37,833 --> 00:52:44,256
Yes. He wants me to tell you
what he's saying word for word.

476
00:52:48,427 --> 00:52:51,513
- Molly, you're in danger.
- You can't blurt it out like that!

477
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:56,060
Quit moving around - you're making
me dizzy. I'll tell her in my own way.

478
00:52:57,144 --> 00:53:01,357
Molly, you're in danger, girl.

479
00:53:02,441 --> 00:53:07,112
- What are you talking about?
- He knows the man who killed him.

480
00:53:07,279 --> 00:53:09,907
His name is Willie Lopez,
and I know where he lives.

481
00:53:10,115 --> 00:53:12,493
His name is Willie Lopez,
and he knows where he lives.

482
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:16,705
- Write it down.
- I ain't no secretary!

483
00:53:16,872 --> 00:53:18,874
Just do it!

484
00:53:21,043 --> 00:53:22,378
He's so testy!

485
00:53:23,629 --> 00:53:28,384
- What do I write?
- It's 303, Prospect Place, apt. 4D.

486
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:31,971
303 Prospect Place?

487
00:53:32,137 --> 00:53:35,307
- It's my neighbourhood.
- Molly, he's got my wallet,

488
00:53:35,474 --> 00:53:38,477
he's got my key, and he was in here.

489
00:53:38,644 --> 00:53:42,147
- He was in here.
- Yesterday, when you came back,

490
00:53:42,314 --> 00:53:45,442
you went upstairs,
you talked to Floyd...

491
00:53:45,651 --> 00:53:50,781
When you came back he was here.
He saw everything.

492
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:55,244
Molly, go to the police.
It was a set-up. I was murdered.

493
00:53:56,996 --> 00:53:59,999
He says go to the police.
It was a set-up, he was murdered.

494
00:54:00,165 --> 00:54:05,337
- Somebody else is involved.
- Forget it. I don't want this.

495
00:54:05,504 --> 00:54:07,965
- Where are you going?
- I'm leaving.

496
00:54:08,132 --> 00:54:12,469
I did everything I said I would.
Don't follow me, because l'm finished.

497
00:54:12,636 --> 00:54:16,140
Have a nice life, have a nice death,
goodbye.

498
00:54:19,184 --> 00:54:23,605
There's no one on earth whod
want this to be true more than me.

499
00:54:23,772 --> 00:54:26,817
You've got to be rational about this.

500
00:54:26,984 --> 00:54:29,987
Sam is no more in this room than...

501
00:54:32,906 --> 00:54:37,369
I understand the need
to hang on to him, I really do.

502
00:54:37,536 --> 00:54:42,875
- But this is absurd!
- It seems absurd, but it had to be real.

503
00:54:43,042 --> 00:54:46,962
How could you believe
a fortune-teller from Brooklyn?

504
00:54:47,129 --> 00:54:52,593
- I watched them have a conversation.
- I don't buy it, not for a minute.

505
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:56,221
- What about the things she knew?
- What things?

506
00:54:56,388 --> 00:55:02,019
The photo Sam took of me
on our trip to Reno. We were alone.

507
00:55:02,227 --> 00:55:06,148
And the green underwear
that I wrote my name in.

508
00:55:09,068 --> 00:55:11,236
She said Sam knew who killed him.

509
00:55:13,072 --> 00:55:17,952
- That he was set up.
- This is getting deranged.

510
00:55:18,118 --> 00:55:20,537
- She had a name and an address.
- Good, Molly...

511
00:55:20,704 --> 00:55:24,708
Willie Lopez,
303 Prospect Place, apt. 4D.

512
00:55:26,001 --> 00:55:30,547
- This is sick.
- Oh, Carl!

513
00:55:33,926 --> 00:55:37,137
Molly, I don't understand
how you could...

514
00:55:39,223 --> 00:55:41,809
..swallow this crap.

515
00:55:41,976 --> 00:55:44,645
This guy may not even exist.

516
00:55:44,812 --> 00:55:49,191
Maybe she's using you
to set someone up.

517
00:55:49,358 --> 00:55:53,904
You're right. You're absolutely right.

518
00:55:54,071 --> 00:55:58,492
- That's what l've got to find out.
- How are you going to do that?

519
00:55:58,659 --> 00:56:01,245
She said Sam wants me
to go to the police.

520
00:56:01,453 --> 00:56:06,208
Sam wants you to go to the police?
Jesus, Moll... !

521
00:56:06,375 --> 00:56:08,419
What are you going to tell them?

522
00:56:08,627 --> 00:56:13,340
That some storefront psychic lady
has been communing with the dead?

523
00:56:13,507 --> 00:56:18,178
Do you know how that sounds?
You're talking ghosts here!

524
00:56:19,847 --> 00:56:21,432
I'm sorry,

525
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:24,560
this really gets to me.

526
00:56:24,727 --> 00:56:29,273
- It's OK if you don't believe me.
- I'm trying to, Molly.

527
00:56:32,818 --> 00:56:34,737
Look...

528
00:56:36,322 --> 00:56:41,076
..if it'll make you feel any better,
l'll go check this out.

529
00:56:41,243 --> 00:56:44,246
I want you to try and get some sleep.

530
00:56:44,413 --> 00:56:46,206
OK?

531
00:56:48,626 --> 00:56:52,004
I'll call you in the morning.
Goodnight.

532
00:57:19,073 --> 00:57:21,033
Be careful!

533
00:57:34,546 --> 00:57:38,592
Carl! What the hell
are you doing here?

534
00:57:40,344 --> 00:57:44,348
- Who have you been talking to?
- What do you mean?

535
00:57:44,556 --> 00:57:49,061
Some woman knows all about you.
Where's she getting it from?

536
00:57:49,228 --> 00:57:53,440
- I haven't said a word to anybody.
- She knows your name and address.

537
00:57:53,607 --> 00:58:00,114
- How do women know where I live?
- She knows about the murder!

538
00:58:00,281 --> 00:58:03,701
Now, I want you to find this bitch,
whoever she is,

539
00:58:03,867 --> 00:58:05,869
and I want you to...

540
00:58:07,830 --> 00:58:09,999
Just get rid of her, OK?

541
00:58:10,749 --> 00:58:16,088
I've got 4 million dollars stuffed in
a goddamn computer.

542
00:58:16,255 --> 00:58:21,093
If I don't get those codes,
if that money is not transferred soon...

543
00:58:23,053 --> 00:58:26,849
..l'm... dead. We're both dead.

544
00:58:27,016 --> 00:58:30,394
Tell them you only launder money
on the first of the month.

545
00:58:30,561 --> 00:58:35,399
What the hell is wrong with you?
ls everything a joke?

546
00:58:35,566 --> 00:58:39,236
You killed a man.
You were supposed to steal his wallet.

547
00:58:39,403 --> 00:58:42,197
I did you a favour, man,
that was a freebie.

548
00:58:43,449 --> 00:58:46,452
Look, these are drug dealers, OK?

549
00:58:47,911 --> 00:58:51,915
Just don't blow this for me, Willie.
Id lose my job, go to jail.

550
00:58:52,791 --> 00:58:55,294
$80,000 of that money is mine.

551
00:58:58,505 --> 00:59:02,468
Let me have the keys
to Sam's apartment,

552
00:59:02,635 --> 00:59:05,471
I'll get the address book myself, OK?

553
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:35,459
You goddamn bastard! Why?

554
00:59:35,668 --> 00:59:39,630
You were my friend!

555
00:59:39,797 --> 00:59:42,299
I had a life, goddamn you!

556
00:59:42,466 --> 00:59:44,551
I had a life!

557
00:59:52,810 --> 00:59:56,313
I don't even believe
in this stuff myself.

558
00:59:56,522 --> 00:59:59,024
But she was real.

559
00:59:59,191 --> 01:00:02,152
Do you think ld come here
if it wasn't real?

560
01:00:04,071 --> 01:00:08,617
You told me if I had any new
information, that I should come.

561
01:00:08,784 --> 01:00:10,953
So, here I am.

562
01:00:14,707 --> 01:00:20,587
I know how this sounds. I hear myself
saying it, and I want to cringe.

563
01:00:20,754 --> 01:00:26,135
But she knew things she couldn't have
known. Things Sam only said to me.

564
01:00:26,302 --> 01:00:29,638
According to this psychic lady,

565
01:00:29,805 --> 01:00:33,809
there are ghosts and spirits
all over the place?

566
01:00:33,976 --> 01:00:36,645
Watching us all the time?

567
01:00:39,398 --> 01:00:42,067
I'm never going
to get undressed again.

568
01:00:43,068 --> 01:00:47,698
Excuse me.
I've got more important things to do.

569
01:00:57,750 --> 01:01:03,213
The guy's name is Willie Lopez.
All l'm asking is for you to check it out.

570
01:01:03,422 --> 01:01:08,052
OK. You wait here and let me see
if the guy's got a record.

571
01:01:09,261 --> 01:01:11,597
Right.

572
01:02:12,658 --> 01:02:17,913
- Where's the file on Willie Lopez?
- There's no file for Willie Lopez.

573
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:22,418
He was probably some old boyfriend
she was trying to get even with.

574
01:02:22,584 --> 01:02:26,547
This psychic woman's
got a long record.

575
01:02:26,714 --> 01:02:29,675
1 967, Shreveport.

576
01:02:29,842 --> 01:02:33,470
Forgery, selling of false ID.

577
01:02:33,679 --> 01:02:36,223
Served one year in 1 971 .

578
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:38,976
Arrested for fraud,

579
01:02:39,143 --> 01:02:43,022
numbers racketeering,
served ten months, 1 974.

580
01:02:43,188 --> 01:02:46,942
- Look, this is impossible!
- It goes on and on.

581
01:02:47,109 --> 01:02:51,530
She knew things - private things.
How could she have known all that?

582
01:02:51,697 --> 01:02:54,033
A lot of times they read the obits.

583
01:02:54,199 --> 01:02:57,453
All she had to do
was see the word 创banker.创 Boom.

584
01:02:57,620 --> 01:03:02,207
They even go through your garbage
to find things they can use.

585
01:03:02,374 --> 01:03:06,211
Letters, old papers.
It doesn't take much.

586
01:03:06,378 --> 01:03:08,005
No.

587
01:03:09,673 --> 01:03:12,217
It was real.

588
01:03:13,844 --> 01:03:18,891
She knew about a sweater I knitted.

589
01:03:19,058 --> 01:03:21,769
And songs we sang.

590
01:03:26,023 --> 01:03:30,277
The trip to Montego Bay.

591
01:03:30,444 --> 01:03:34,323
I'm sorry. I know this is hard.

592
01:03:34,490 --> 01:03:35,991
People want so much to believe.

593
01:03:36,158 --> 01:03:42,373
They're grieving, they're vulnerable.
And they will give anything

594
01:03:42,539 --> 01:03:48,754
for one last moment. Believe me,
these people know what they're doing.

595
01:03:48,921 --> 01:03:54,093
I know how you must feel,
but you know you can press charges.

596
01:03:57,888 --> 01:03:59,848
No.

597
01:04:02,768 --> 01:04:04,603
Thank you.

598
01:04:18,659 --> 01:04:20,828
Oh, God, let this be it.

599
01:04:33,382 --> 01:04:35,259
Yes!

600
01:04:46,937 --> 01:04:49,940
- Hello.
- Eddie, it's Carl Bruner.

601
01:04:50,107 --> 01:04:55,529
Everything's fine. We're all set.
What do you want me to do?

602
01:04:55,696 --> 01:04:59,491
I want you to transfer the money
into a single account

603
01:04:59,658 --> 01:05:02,536
under the name 创Rita Miller. 创

604
01:05:02,703 --> 01:05:06,248
Tomorrow, at five minutes
before closing, 3.55 pm,

605
01:05:06,415 --> 01:05:10,127
transfer the full account to
the First lsland Bank ofNassau,

606
01:05:10,294 --> 01:05:14,006
registry number 486-9580.

607
01:05:14,173 --> 01:05:18,636
- Call us when it's done.
- OK, l've got it.

608
01:05:18,802 --> 01:05:22,431
Just tell Mr Balistrari that there
won't be any more problems, OK.

609
01:05:22,598 --> 01:05:25,601
Yeah, l'll do that. Good work.

610
01:06:25,327 --> 01:06:29,081
Molly, why can't you hear me?
I need you.

611
01:06:41,927 --> 01:06:45,097
- Who is it?
- It's Carl, Molly.

612
01:06:45,264 --> 01:06:49,059
No, don't open the goddamn door!
He's a murderer.

613
01:06:49,226 --> 01:06:52,730
Listen, I know it's late.
I'm sorry to disturb you.

614
01:06:52,938 --> 01:06:56,066
I've been thinking about you all day.

615
01:06:56,233 --> 01:06:59,528
I feel really lousy about last night.

616
01:06:59,695 --> 01:07:03,824
- This supernatural thing...
- Don't worry about it, really. It's OK.

617
01:07:03,991 --> 01:07:07,828
It's not. You needed me
to hear you, and I didn't.

618
01:07:07,995 --> 01:07:12,583
I wasn't there for you,
and that was wrong.

619
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:16,211
It's just... I just...

620
01:07:16,378 --> 01:07:19,757
I want you to know
that l'm your friend.

621
01:07:20,966 --> 01:07:23,218
- Thanks, Carl.
- You were never her friend.

622
01:07:23,385 --> 01:07:26,430
- That means a lot to me.
- Me, too.

623
01:07:26,639 --> 01:07:29,975
I've brought you some
Japanese apple pears.

624
01:07:32,227 --> 01:07:37,149
- Thanks, that's very sweet.
- Could I come in for a second?

625
01:07:37,316 --> 01:07:40,402
I won't stay long,
it's just been one of those days.

626
01:07:40,569 --> 01:07:43,447
- Yeah, come on in.
- No, Molly.

627
01:07:44,114 --> 01:07:46,992
You seem a little tense. Are you OK?

628
01:07:47,159 --> 01:07:53,415
No, l'm fine. It's just...
What can I tell you? lt's been tough.

629
01:07:53,582 --> 01:07:55,334
It still hurts so much.

630
01:07:55,501 --> 01:08:00,130
- You lying snake!
- On top of it, there's stuff at work.

631
01:08:00,339 --> 01:08:03,968
They've given me my own accounts,
which is good.

632
01:08:04,134 --> 01:08:06,679
But I just haven't really
had time to adjust,

633
01:08:06,845 --> 01:08:10,140
to absorb everything.

634
01:08:13,352 --> 01:08:14,812
It's no big deal.

635
01:08:26,907 --> 01:08:30,160
- Can I have a little more cream?
- Yeah.

636
01:08:31,537 --> 01:08:35,291
Oh, shit!
Jesus, I can't believe I did that.

637
01:08:35,457 --> 01:08:37,126
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

638
01:08:40,546 --> 01:08:44,800
- Let me throw that in the washer.
- Don't worry about it. It's OK.

639
01:08:44,967 --> 01:08:48,887
- Can I get you another shirt?
- No, it'll dry in a minute.

640
01:08:54,685 --> 01:09:00,107
Where were you today? I thought
you were coming into the bank.

641
01:09:00,274 --> 01:09:05,738
I was supposed to, but I didn't
have time. I went to the police.

642
01:09:12,494 --> 01:09:16,707
You did? What did you tell them?
What did they say?

643
01:09:16,915 --> 01:09:19,376
It was awful.

644
01:09:19,585 --> 01:09:23,005
I felt really stupid.

645
01:09:23,213 --> 01:09:28,052
They brought out a file on this woman
at least ten inches thick.

646
01:09:28,218 --> 01:09:30,721
- Rip-off artist, huh?
- No, Molly!

647
01:09:32,973 --> 01:09:37,936
You know, the sad thing
is that I believed her.

648
01:09:38,938 --> 01:09:40,898
Molly...

649
01:09:42,024 --> 01:09:45,319
..sometimes we need to believe.

650
01:09:45,486 --> 01:09:47,571
Why? What's the point?

651
01:09:47,738 --> 01:09:50,282
It's not easy to face the realities of life.

652
01:09:50,449 --> 01:09:53,160
Sometimes you've
got to give yourself that.

653
01:09:53,327 --> 01:09:57,081
You've got to remember
the love you guys felt. That's real.

654
01:09:57,289 --> 01:10:00,501
Remember how good Sam was,
how much he loved you.

655
01:10:00,668 --> 01:10:04,922
You were everything to him, Molly.
You were his life.

656
01:10:18,686 --> 01:10:20,479
I feel so alone.

657
01:10:28,821 --> 01:10:31,991
You're not alone, OK.

658
01:10:32,157 --> 01:10:35,619
You've got your work - you're talented.
You're young.

659
01:10:36,453 --> 01:10:38,914
You're fantastically gorgeous.

660
01:10:40,457 --> 01:10:43,794
I don't know what's real anymore.

661
01:10:43,961 --> 01:10:46,171
I don't know what to think.

662
01:10:49,383 --> 01:10:51,885
Just think about Sam.

663
01:10:53,846 --> 01:10:59,184
Think about the time you two guys
had together. How wonderful that was.

664
01:11:03,022 --> 01:11:05,941
Let your feelings out, it's OK.

665
01:11:06,108 --> 01:11:09,111
Life turns on a dime.

666
01:11:10,279 --> 01:11:12,781
You know...?

667
01:11:15,075 --> 01:11:20,956
People think they're forever, that there
is always tomorrow. That's bullshit.

668
01:11:21,123 --> 01:11:24,668
Sam taught us that.

669
01:11:24,835 --> 01:11:26,837
We have to live for now.

670
01:11:29,757 --> 01:11:32,009
For today.

671
01:11:51,028 --> 01:11:53,489
- I can't. I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

672
01:11:53,656 --> 01:11:57,201
- I can't, it's just too soon.
- It's OK.

673
01:11:57,368 --> 01:12:00,079
You've been great, Carl.

674
01:12:02,581 --> 01:12:05,709
- But I need you to leave.
- It's OK, I understand.

675
01:12:05,918 --> 01:12:07,878
Please...

676
01:12:13,592 --> 01:12:19,598
Could we just have dinner tomorrow?
Just talk.

677
01:12:19,765 --> 01:12:22,518
- Yeah, sure.
- Great.

678
01:13:31,629 --> 01:13:33,839
Hey!

679
01:13:36,634 --> 01:13:39,678
- Get off my train!
- No.

680
01:13:40,512 --> 01:13:42,097
Get off!

681
01:13:42,264 --> 01:13:44,975
Get off! Get off!

682
01:13:45,184 --> 01:13:47,645
Get off! Get out of here!

683
01:13:48,562 --> 01:13:50,230
- Get off!
- No.

684
01:13:50,397 --> 01:13:53,609
Show me how you do that.
I'm not leaving till you teach me.

685
01:13:53,776 --> 01:13:55,819
Get off!

686
01:13:55,986 --> 01:13:57,529
- No.
- Get off!

687
01:14:04,745 --> 01:14:07,831
You stubborn asshole!

688
01:14:10,334 --> 01:14:16,215
What the hell are you doing? You're
trying to move it with your fingers.

689
01:14:16,382 --> 01:14:18,634
You can't push it with your finger.
You're dead.

690
01:14:27,476 --> 01:14:32,898
It's all in your mind. Your problem
is that you still think you're real.

691
01:14:33,065 --> 01:14:36,902
You think you're wearing those clothes?
That you're crouching there?

692
01:14:37,069 --> 01:14:42,074
Bullshit! You ain't got a body no more.
It's all up here now.

693
01:14:42,241 --> 01:14:47,705
You want to move something, you've
got to move it with your mind. Focus!

694
01:14:47,871 --> 01:14:52,042
- How? How do you focus?
- I don't know how you focus.

695
01:14:52,209 --> 01:14:54,169
You just focus.

696
01:14:57,923 --> 01:14:59,341
How did you do that?

697
01:14:59,508 --> 01:15:03,220
You take all of your emotions,
all your anger, love, hate.

698
01:15:03,429 --> 01:15:06,765
Push it, down here
into the pit of your stomach,

699
01:15:06,932 --> 01:15:09,768
and then let it explode, like a reactor.

700
01:15:19,528 --> 01:15:21,322
Don't laugh!

701
01:15:45,638 --> 01:15:50,100
- Way to go, kid.
- I did it!

702
01:15:50,309 --> 01:15:51,435
I did it!

703
01:15:52,144 --> 01:15:54,647
Way to go.

704
01:16:00,527 --> 01:16:03,113
From your gut, like I told you.

705
01:16:05,908 --> 01:16:09,370
Give it time.
What else have you got?

706
01:16:17,336 --> 01:16:18,837
How long have you been here?

707
01:16:21,298 --> 01:16:23,258
Since they pushed me.

708
01:16:23,425 --> 01:16:26,136
- Someone pushed you?
- Yeah.

709
01:16:26,887 --> 01:16:29,348
- Who?
- You don't believe me?

710
01:16:29,515 --> 01:16:33,477
You think I fell? You think I jumped?
Well, fuck you!

711
01:16:33,644 --> 01:16:37,356
It wasn't my time!
I wasn't supposed to go!

712
01:16:37,523 --> 01:16:39,817
I'm not supposed to be here.

713
01:16:49,493 --> 01:16:52,997
Id give anything for a drag!

714
01:16:53,163 --> 01:16:57,293
- Just one drag.
- Are you all right?

715
01:16:57,459 --> 01:17:02,298
Who are you? Why are you
hounding me? Who sent you?

716
01:17:04,341 --> 01:17:06,802
Who sent you?

717
01:17:08,387 --> 01:17:13,934
Leave me alone!

718
01:18:13,619 --> 01:18:17,081
Concentrate, and you'll
probably rouse him.

719
01:18:17,289 --> 01:18:20,751
- What's his name again?
- Orlando.

720
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:24,546
Orlando, Orlando.
Is there an Orlando here?

721
01:18:24,713 --> 01:18:26,924
- I'm here.
- He's here.

722
01:18:27,091 --> 01:18:31,261
- Sam!
- I'm Orlando. The line's over there.

723
01:18:31,470 --> 01:18:35,724
Where did these ghosts come from?
You can hear them, too?

724
01:18:35,891 --> 01:18:39,853
In the morning and in the evening.
They come into the shower!

725
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:43,482
Did you tell every spook in the world
about me?

726
01:18:43,649 --> 01:18:48,487
I got spooks from Jersey. There's stuff
going on you wouldn't believe.

727
01:18:48,654 --> 01:18:53,450
- It's amazing. You're really doing it!
- Can you please hurry this up?

728
01:18:53,617 --> 01:18:55,619
Chill out!

729
01:18:55,828 --> 01:18:59,164
I need your help again.
There's something we need to do.

730
01:18:59,331 --> 01:19:01,709
I'm not doing anything else with you.

731
01:19:01,875 --> 01:19:07,589
You're holding on to a life that doesn't
want you anymore. Give up the ghost.

732
01:19:07,756 --> 01:19:12,803
- Are you speaking to me?
- Does it look like l'm speaking to you?

733
01:19:12,970 --> 01:19:17,683
You're supposed to be concentrating.
Are you going to try it?

734
01:19:17,850 --> 01:19:20,519
Are you going to get out?
l've got work to do.

735
01:19:20,686 --> 01:19:25,524
Fine, then stay there.
Excuse me, are you ready now?

736
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:28,152
Let's do it.

737
01:19:28,319 --> 01:19:32,615
Listen, l've got to talk to you now.
I've got a plan.

738
01:19:35,534 --> 01:19:38,120
Oda Mae?

739
01:19:43,375 --> 01:19:45,544
Oda Mae?

740
01:19:46,879 --> 01:19:49,173
Ortisha.

741
01:19:50,007 --> 01:19:54,303
- Orlando! ls that you?
- Where are you at? I can hardly see.

742
01:19:54,470 --> 01:19:58,849
- She's here!
- In front of you. I'm right here!

743
01:20:03,228 --> 01:20:05,689
Damn, baby, what did you do
to your hair?

744
01:20:07,775 --> 01:20:11,904
Orlando, do you like it?
lt's autumn sunrise.

745
01:20:14,615 --> 01:20:17,868
Get out of me, you son of a bitch!

746
01:20:21,580 --> 01:20:24,875
- Don't ever do that to me again!
- Orlando...?

747
01:20:27,002 --> 01:20:28,921
I can barely move.

748
01:20:29,088 --> 01:20:33,008
You should know better.
Jumping into bodies wipes you out.

749
01:20:33,175 --> 01:20:38,055
- Everybody out!
- What happened to Orlando?

750
01:20:38,222 --> 01:20:41,892
Are you deaf? I said everybody out!

751
01:20:42,101 --> 01:20:47,022
Everybody out! Get out, get out!
Everybody get out!

752
01:20:58,659 --> 01:21:01,370
- Get out!
- Are you the fortune-teller?

753
01:21:01,537 --> 01:21:05,457
- Who are you?
- That's an interesting question.

754
01:21:06,083 --> 01:21:08,377
- Why don't you tell me?
- Willie.

755
01:21:08,544 --> 01:21:10,462
Willie?

756
01:21:10,629 --> 01:21:14,425
- Prospect Place Willie?
- Get out of here fast!

757
01:21:29,815 --> 01:21:31,692
I'm all right.

758
01:21:33,944 --> 01:21:39,450
- We're in trouble. You have to help.
- Who's we? You're already dead.

759
01:21:39,617 --> 01:21:43,287
- They're trying to kill me!
- And they'll be back.

760
01:21:43,495 --> 01:21:46,915
Why don't you find a house to haunt?

761
01:21:47,124 --> 01:21:49,585
Get some chains and rattle them.

762
01:21:49,793 --> 01:21:53,005
I have a plan.
You've got to get some fake IDs.

763
01:21:53,172 --> 01:21:57,926
- Forget it.
- If you do this, they'll leave you alone.

764
01:22:03,015 --> 01:22:04,642
Scout's honour.

765
01:22:05,935 --> 01:22:08,062
All right.

766
01:22:08,228 --> 01:22:10,856
What exactly do I have to do?

767
01:22:13,025 --> 01:22:14,652
Have you got a nice dress?

768
01:22:17,988 --> 01:22:22,910
- What's wrong with my clothes?
- I made a joke. I love your shoes.

769
01:22:23,077 --> 01:22:27,706
I'm going home. I don't know anything
about banking. I don't know if it'll work.

770
01:22:27,873 --> 01:22:30,501
- Just relax.
- I'm nervous.

771
01:22:30,709 --> 01:22:34,713
I know you're nervous,
but l'll get you through it.

772
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:36,799
I don't think I should do this.

773
01:22:36,966 --> 01:22:42,012
- We're going to New Accounts.
- I'm giving them no money!

774
01:22:42,221 --> 01:22:44,890
Do what I say, and don't talk!

775
01:22:47,559 --> 01:22:49,937
You're here to fill out a signature card
for a new account.

776
01:22:50,104 --> 01:22:51,563
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

777
01:22:51,730 --> 01:22:55,276
I'm here to fill out
a card for a new account.

778
01:22:55,442 --> 01:22:59,530
- Do you know your account number?
- 926-31 043.

779
01:22:59,697 --> 01:23:03,367
926-31 043.

780
01:23:05,119 --> 01:23:06,954
- Rita Miller.
- What?

781
01:23:07,121 --> 01:23:08,706
Tell her Rita Miller.

782
01:23:08,872 --> 01:23:11,625
Didn't you sign when you
opened the account?

783
01:23:11,792 --> 01:23:14,420
Tell her Carl Bruner did it by phone.

784
01:23:14,586 --> 01:23:18,549
Carl Bruner opened that account
for me by phone,

785
01:23:18,757 --> 01:23:21,885
and he's asked me to come in today.

786
01:23:23,095 --> 01:23:25,556
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

787
01:23:27,558 --> 01:23:31,478
Just sign this card
on the bottom line, please.

788
01:23:31,645 --> 01:23:34,857
May I use your pen?

789
01:23:40,070 --> 01:23:42,740
No! Rita Miller!

790
01:23:42,948 --> 01:23:45,576
I'm so sorry.

791
01:23:45,743 --> 01:23:48,537
I need another one.
I signed the wrong name.

792
01:23:55,628 --> 01:23:59,340
Tell her to send it up to the third floor
file, you have a transaction to make.

793
01:23:59,506 --> 01:24:04,762
Make sure this goes to the third floor,
I have a transfusion to make.

794
01:24:05,596 --> 01:24:06,805
Let's go.

795
01:24:06,972 --> 01:24:09,725
You know what I mean... !
Can I keep this pen?

796
01:24:09,892 --> 01:24:14,688
- Yes, sure.
- Thank you so much.

797
01:24:15,856 --> 01:24:19,068
Bye-bye. I love these pens.

798
01:24:20,486 --> 01:24:22,196
What do you want to keep the pen for?

799
01:24:23,989 --> 01:24:27,576
Carl Bruner speaking. Mr Balistrari?

800
01:24:27,743 --> 01:24:30,120
Balistrari? lt's me, John.

801
01:24:30,329 --> 01:24:32,623
John... Sorry!

802
01:24:32,831 --> 01:24:35,084
What's up?

803
01:24:35,250 --> 01:24:37,336
I've got the info
on the Bradley portfolio.

804
01:24:37,503 --> 01:24:42,800
- I'll pick it up later, all right?
- I'll be here till six.

805
01:24:48,472 --> 01:24:51,558
I couldn't talk you into losing the hat?

806
01:24:51,725 --> 01:24:55,646
Keep messing with me,
you'll be here by yourself.

807
01:24:55,813 --> 01:25:00,818
You're here to see Lyle Ferguson.

808
01:25:01,026 --> 01:25:04,822
- I'm here to see Lyle Ferguson.
- Do you have an appointment?

809
01:25:04,989 --> 01:25:07,950
- No, l'm here for my health.
- Tell him Rita Miller's here!

810
01:25:08,117 --> 01:25:12,538
- Tell him Rita Miller's here.
- Just one moment, please.

811
01:25:12,705 --> 01:25:15,207
- Don't embellish.
- Jawohl!

812
01:25:15,374 --> 01:25:17,543
Excuse me?

813
01:25:20,004 --> 01:25:23,173
This guy Ferguson is a real jerk.

814
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:26,260
I've known him five years.

815
01:25:26,427 --> 01:25:30,389
- Why are you whispering?
- Just listen!

816
01:25:30,556 --> 01:25:33,392
He's a social moron,
you've got nothing to worry about.

817
01:25:33,559 --> 01:25:40,816
Tell the guard Ferguson knows you,
from the Brewster's Christmas party.

818
01:25:40,983 --> 01:25:43,027
What is this in regards to?

819
01:25:43,193 --> 01:25:48,324
He doesn't remember me? We spent
time at the Brewster's, last Christmas.

820
01:25:48,490 --> 01:25:54,413
He and his lovely wife, Shirley. It was
beautiful. A big old tree and presents...

821
01:25:57,875 --> 01:26:00,586
Gas!

822
01:26:00,753 --> 01:26:04,381
I get a little gas from time to time.

823
01:26:05,841 --> 01:26:09,970
- Quit poking me!
- Well, don't overdo it!

824
01:26:10,137 --> 01:26:16,060
Ferguson was so drunk, he could've
met Tina Turner and not remember.

825
01:26:22,524 --> 01:26:24,485
Here we go!

826
01:26:27,029 --> 01:26:29,698
Hello.

827
01:26:31,533 --> 01:26:34,995
Of course.
Well, it's been a long time.

828
01:26:35,162 --> 01:26:37,831
- Oh, a long time.
- Ask about Bobby and Snooky.

829
01:26:37,998 --> 01:26:42,544
- How are Bobby and Snooky?
- Fine... fine.

830
01:26:42,711 --> 01:26:45,506
Thank you for asking.

831
01:26:45,673 --> 01:26:48,926
And how is your...

832
01:26:49,093 --> 01:26:51,762
- ..family?
- Oh, couldn't be better.

833
01:26:51,971 --> 01:26:54,890
Well, wonderful.

834
01:26:55,057 --> 01:26:58,060
Ask how they did
on the Gibraltar Securities.

835
01:26:58,227 --> 01:27:02,314
I was wondering, how did you do
on the Gibraltar Securities?

836
01:27:02,481 --> 01:27:07,861
Gibraltar Securities? Well, it looks like
we topped out on that one.

837
01:27:08,028 --> 01:27:11,615
- We sure did.
- That was a very useful tip.

838
01:27:11,782 --> 01:27:14,243
Good old Randy.

839
01:27:14,451 --> 01:27:17,037
Got a good head
on his shoulders... her shoulders.

840
01:27:17,204 --> 01:27:19,790
- Her shoulders.
- Randy.

841
01:27:20,916 --> 01:27:25,421
So, what brings you here today?

842
01:27:25,587 --> 01:27:26,880
I'm closing an account.

843
01:27:27,047 --> 01:27:29,633
Do you have your account number?

844
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:33,012
- Yes? Yes.
- 926-31 043.

845
01:27:33,178 --> 01:27:34,471
926...

846
01:27:34,638 --> 01:27:39,101
..31 043. Is that right?

847
01:27:47,443 --> 01:27:52,823
Well, Rita - it looks like you'll be
withdrawing four million dollars.

848
01:27:52,990 --> 01:27:56,160
- Four million dollars!
- Say yes.

849
01:27:56,327 --> 01:27:58,495
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

850
01:27:58,704 --> 01:28:04,251
Yes. That's correct.

851
01:28:07,630 --> 01:28:11,550
- How would you like that?
- Tens and twenties.

852
01:28:11,717 --> 01:28:13,886
- Pardon?
- Tell him a cashier's cheque.

853
01:28:14,053 --> 01:28:18,682
- A cashier's cheque.
- Cashier's cheque. Fine!

854
01:28:18,891 --> 01:28:23,020
Of course, you know
we require identification.

855
01:28:23,187 --> 01:28:27,524
It's a procedural thing.

856
01:28:37,868 --> 01:28:41,538
Thank you. I'll be right back.

857
01:28:42,665 --> 01:28:45,042
Four million dollars!

858
01:28:51,131 --> 01:28:55,052
Get me the First lsland Bank
of Nassau. It's on the Rolodex.

859
01:29:04,812 --> 01:29:08,274
Now, we have some things
for you to sign here.

860
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:14,029
This officially closes the account.

861
01:29:14,196 --> 01:29:16,115
Sign 创Rita Miller.创

862
01:29:18,909 --> 01:29:20,953
Miller - that's my name.

863
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:23,539
My name - Rita Miller.

864
01:29:23,706 --> 01:29:24,915
My name.

865
01:29:29,795 --> 01:29:32,923
I'll be right back.

866
01:29:33,090 --> 01:29:37,094
- Just anywhere?
- Right here.

867
01:29:41,473 --> 01:29:42,808
Fine.

868
01:29:42,975 --> 01:29:46,270
The cheque...

869
01:29:46,437 --> 01:29:49,690
..here you are.

870
01:29:58,657 --> 01:30:01,285
Mama took the money
from the oil wells,

871
01:30:01,493 --> 01:30:05,122
and she sunk it into gas pumps.

872
01:30:05,331 --> 01:30:09,126
And those gas stations have five
or six of those things, so it's lucrative.

873
01:30:09,335 --> 01:30:13,088
- Oda Mae, we've got to go.
- Got to go now.

874
01:30:13,255 --> 01:30:17,676
It's been a pleasure doing business.
May I keep the pen?

875
01:30:18,636 --> 01:30:20,846
Say goodnight to Bobby
and Snooky for me.

876
01:30:21,013 --> 01:30:22,806
Bye-bye.

877
01:30:28,687 --> 01:30:30,689
What is wrong?

878
01:30:40,157 --> 01:30:42,952
Excuse me - Lyle?

879
01:30:43,118 --> 01:30:44,620
Molly Jensen.

880
01:30:44,828 --> 01:30:49,124
The woman you were doing business
with. What did she want?

881
01:30:49,291 --> 01:30:52,419
Did it have anything to do
with me or Sam?

882
01:30:52,586 --> 01:30:56,715
- Sam? No.
- That was Oda Mae Brown, right?

883
01:30:56,882 --> 01:31:01,178
Her name was Rita Miller.
She was closing an account.

884
01:31:01,345 --> 01:31:04,098
Is there a problem?

885
01:31:04,265 --> 01:31:06,892
No. I guess not.

886
01:31:37,256 --> 01:31:40,050
Carl? ls something wrong?

887
01:31:40,217 --> 01:31:43,387
Did somebody play
with the computers?

888
01:31:43,554 --> 01:31:46,932
- One of my accounts is closed.
- What's wrong?

889
01:31:47,099 --> 01:31:52,980
- Do you want me to call someone?
- It's OK.

890
01:31:56,442 --> 01:32:00,029
Four million dollars! What am I
going to do with this money?

891
01:32:00,195 --> 01:32:03,115
I'm going to buy the building.
No, l'll buy the block.

892
01:32:03,282 --> 01:32:08,370
I'm going to make
my sister go to a fat farm.

893
01:32:08,537 --> 01:32:12,583
Wait, Oda Mae.
Take the cheque out of your purse.

894
01:32:12,791 --> 01:32:16,587
You're right, l'll put it
where nobody can get it.

895
01:32:16,795 --> 01:32:19,256
No. Endorse it.

896
01:32:20,174 --> 01:32:22,718
No, if I drop it,
then somebody will get it.

897
01:32:22,885 --> 01:32:26,805
It's not yours.
I never said you would get the money.

898
01:32:27,765 --> 01:32:32,603
This is blood money. I was killed
for this money. Endorse the cheque.

899
01:32:32,770 --> 01:32:36,941
- What are you going to do with it?
- Look over there.

900
01:32:38,067 --> 01:32:39,610
To your left.

901
01:32:42,821 --> 01:32:47,117
You don't think l'm giving this
to a bunch of nuns?

902
01:32:47,284 --> 01:32:51,455
Otherwise they will track you down.
Your only protection is to get rid of it.

903
01:32:51,622 --> 01:32:54,208
You're kidding me!

904
01:32:54,375 --> 01:32:57,127
You'll go to heaven!

905
01:32:57,294 --> 01:33:00,631
I want to go to a bank
and cash this cheque.

906
01:33:04,385 --> 01:33:08,013
- Hello.
- You'll thank me later.

907
01:33:10,474 --> 01:33:13,394
- Endorse it 创Rita Miller.创
- I know!

908
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:15,896
Make it out to St Joseph's Shelter.

909
01:33:16,063 --> 01:33:19,149
I don't believe
you're making me do this!

910
01:33:24,363 --> 01:33:27,700
- Give it to her.
- I just want to feel it in my fingers.

911
01:33:27,866 --> 01:33:31,245
- Just give her the cheque!
- I will!

912
01:33:38,377 --> 01:33:41,672
- Give her the cheque!
- I will!

913
01:33:44,341 --> 01:33:48,012
Bless you, child. Bless you.

914
01:33:53,350 --> 01:33:54,768
Give it to her.

915
01:33:55,477 --> 01:33:57,771
Let go. Let go!

916
01:34:05,070 --> 01:34:09,450
- I'm proud of you.
- I don't care. Stay away from me!

917
01:34:09,617 --> 01:34:12,911
What'll that nun do with it?
She can't go buy underwear!

918
01:34:13,078 --> 01:34:15,914
Leave me alone!
Never talk to me again.

919
01:34:16,081 --> 01:34:17,916
You're wonderful, Oda Mae!

920
01:34:54,078 --> 01:34:57,289
Go ahead, search! You'll never find it.

921
01:34:58,666 --> 01:35:04,463
They're going to kill you and Willie.
You're going to be fertiliser.

922
01:35:04,630 --> 01:35:07,883
They're going to bury you
next to Jimmy Hoffa.

923
01:35:51,677 --> 01:35:53,971
Who's doing that?

924
01:35:54,179 --> 01:35:56,807
Who's doing that?

925
01:36:11,822 --> 01:36:16,410
Hi. Where were you?
I thought we were having dinner.

926
01:36:16,577 --> 01:36:20,331
- Things got a little crazy, I forgot.
- A little trouble at the bank.

927
01:36:20,497 --> 01:36:25,753
I wish youd have called.
I've been worried.

928
01:36:25,919 --> 01:36:30,507
- I've got to ask you about something.
- He needs to borrow $4,000,000.

929
01:36:30,716 --> 01:36:35,137
When you said you thought
Sam was talking to you,

930
01:36:35,304 --> 01:36:38,849
- what did he say to you?
- Why?

931
01:36:39,016 --> 01:36:44,104
Listen, I want to know exactly what
this psychic lady told you.

932
01:36:44,271 --> 01:36:46,774
Carl, let me go! Stop this!

933
01:36:49,568 --> 01:36:53,656
It doesn't matter. It wasn't real.

934
01:36:53,822 --> 01:36:56,408
What the hell's happened to you?

935
01:36:56,575 --> 01:37:00,079
Does this have anything to do
with her being at the bank today?

936
01:37:02,957 --> 01:37:05,125
At the bank?

937
01:37:05,292 --> 01:37:08,128
Ferguson said she closed an account.

938
01:37:08,629 --> 01:37:13,801
Her name isn't even Oda Mae Brown.
It's Rita Miller.

939
01:37:16,929 --> 01:37:19,556
Carl. Are you all right?

940
01:37:21,475 --> 01:37:23,060
It's just my stomach.

941
01:37:27,564 --> 01:37:30,651
Do you have some Pepto-Bismol?

942
01:37:30,818 --> 01:37:35,281
- Cyanide.
- It's upstairs. Sit down, l'll get it.

943
01:37:41,537 --> 01:37:45,666
What's wrong?
Does little Carl have a tummy ache?

944
01:37:52,423 --> 01:37:54,800
Now do you believe in ghosts?

945
01:37:58,470 --> 01:38:00,639
I'll set the place on fire!

946
01:38:08,647 --> 01:38:10,983
- I'll cut her throat.
- Carl!

947
01:38:12,651 --> 01:38:17,448
I swear to God. I'll cut her throat.

948
01:38:18,991 --> 01:38:22,453
I need that money.
I want it tonight, at 1 1 o'clock.

949
01:38:22,620 --> 01:38:27,625
If that psychic lady does not
bring it here, Molly is dead, OK?

950
01:38:28,542 --> 01:38:30,294
Carl, who are you talking to?

951
01:38:30,461 --> 01:38:33,714
Nothing. Molly, I have to go.

952
01:38:33,881 --> 01:38:37,092
I can't explain it now,
but there's a problem at the bank.

953
01:38:37,259 --> 01:38:41,180
- You're scaring me.
- I can't talk now, l'll be back.

954
01:38:41,347 --> 01:38:43,724
- Why not now?
- I can't talk now.

955
01:38:43,891 --> 01:38:50,105
I'll come back at 1 1 o'clock, OK?
l'm sorry, but it's really important.

956
01:38:50,272 --> 01:38:51,774
- Eleven!
- Oda Mae!

957
01:38:55,736 --> 01:39:00,908
I'm Arsenio Hall. Don't try
to adjust your television. I'm black.

958
01:39:01,867 --> 01:39:05,829
- I want to watch 创Love Connection.创
- I love 创Love Connection.创

959
01:39:05,996 --> 01:39:08,666
Leave that! That's Arsenio.

960
01:39:08,832 --> 01:39:11,919
You love 创Love Connection,创
send your picture in.

961
01:39:12,086 --> 01:39:15,464
- She did!
- They just haven't answered yet.

962
01:39:15,631 --> 01:39:18,592
- Oda Mae!
- Sam?

963
01:39:18,759 --> 01:39:21,762
We're in trouble.
They want the cheque.

964
01:39:21,929 --> 01:39:26,267
The cheque you said
they would never know about?

965
01:39:26,433 --> 01:39:28,602
- What's happening?
- They're here!

966
01:39:28,769 --> 01:39:31,313
Get out of here, now! Go, go!

967
01:39:43,534 --> 01:39:45,744
Knock on the doors!

968
01:39:45,911 --> 01:39:48,038
Help!

969
01:39:48,247 --> 01:39:51,875
- Let us in!
- Who are you kidding?

970
01:40:02,469 --> 01:40:07,141
What are you doing?
The cat don't like visitors.

971
01:40:16,692 --> 01:40:20,654
They're going to get us. Where's Sam?

972
01:40:20,821 --> 01:40:24,700
- It looks like the bitch just left.
- I'll check downstairs.

973
01:40:36,128 --> 01:40:37,504
Carl?

974
01:41:27,554 --> 01:41:28,806
Willie!

975
01:41:38,107 --> 01:41:40,985
You've got a serious problem, man.

976
01:42:02,715 --> 01:42:05,801
Help me! Help!

977
01:43:02,274 --> 01:43:04,568
That dude is dead.

978
01:43:09,531 --> 01:43:10,991
You're dead, Willie.

979
01:43:41,105 --> 01:43:44,650
Help me!

980
01:44:05,379 --> 01:44:07,715
Tell the driver to hurry.

981
01:44:07,881 --> 01:44:12,970
- Can you step on it, please.
- I'm driving as fast as I can.

982
01:44:20,603 --> 01:44:21,812
Problems?

983
01:44:29,862 --> 01:44:32,698
- Carl, is that you?
- It's me, Oda Mae.

984
01:44:32,865 --> 01:44:38,245
I know what you think of me, but we've
got to talk. You are in serious danger.

985
01:44:38,996 --> 01:44:43,042
- I've got Sam here with me.
- Get the hell out of here!

986
01:44:43,208 --> 01:44:46,086
- Im calling the police!
- Good. Tell her to do it!

987
01:44:46,253 --> 01:44:51,258
Fine. We want you to call the police.
But you've got to let us in.

988
01:44:52,217 --> 01:44:56,680
Don't you get it? Sam wasn't
accidentally killed, he was murdered.

989
01:44:56,847 --> 01:44:59,642
He found out
that Carl was laundering money.

990
01:44:59,808 --> 01:45:02,728
Carl is dangerous. He tried to kill me.

991
01:45:02,895 --> 01:45:07,191
He's going to try to kill you, too.
You are in deep, deep trouble.

992
01:45:07,399 --> 01:45:12,821
Why are you doing this to me?
Do you hear me?

993
01:45:13,030 --> 01:45:17,368
Why are you doing this to me?

994
01:45:18,243 --> 01:45:23,832
Oda Mae. Tell her she's wearing
the shirt that I spilt the margarita on,

995
01:45:23,999 --> 01:45:27,002
and the earrings
I gave her for Christmas.

996
01:45:27,211 --> 01:45:31,173
Sam says you're wearing the shirt
he spilt the margarita on,

997
01:45:31,340 --> 01:45:34,718
and the earrings
he gave you for Christmas.

998
01:45:40,057 --> 01:45:43,435
Don't you see?
l'm not a fake! Not about this.

999
01:45:48,941 --> 01:45:51,235
- Give me a penny.
- What?

1000
01:45:51,443 --> 01:45:57,741
- Push a penny under the door, now!
- What are you talking about?

1001
01:46:34,236 --> 01:46:37,990
- Tell her it's for luck.
- Sam says it's for luck.

1002
01:47:14,151 --> 01:47:16,195
Between Green and Mercer on Prince.

1003
01:47:16,362 --> 01:47:19,573
It's the grey building
across from the post office.

1004
01:47:19,740 --> 01:47:23,911
Thanks, Sergeant. Please hurry!
We'll be waiting.

1005
01:47:24,078 --> 01:47:26,997
- They're on their way.
- Good.

1006
01:47:28,540 --> 01:47:32,211
- What do we do now?
- Just wait.

1007
01:47:42,263 --> 01:47:45,224
Is Sam here?

1008
01:47:45,391 --> 01:47:47,851
Sam?

1009
01:47:48,060 --> 01:47:51,105
I'm sitting beside her.

1010
01:47:51,272 --> 01:47:54,233
He's sitting right beside you.

1011
01:48:03,409 --> 01:48:05,703
Sam, can you feel me?

1012
01:48:07,079 --> 01:48:09,540
With all my heart.

1013
01:48:09,707 --> 01:48:12,543
He says with all his heart.

1014
01:48:24,263 --> 01:48:28,684
Id give anything
if I could just touch you once more.

1015
01:48:31,729 --> 01:48:35,316
He says he wishes he was alive again,
so he could touch you.

1016
01:48:38,861 --> 01:48:40,321
Me, too.

1017
01:48:57,212 --> 01:49:01,175
OK. Look - you can use me.

1018
01:49:02,384 --> 01:49:05,012
- Use you?
- Use my body.

1019
01:49:05,179 --> 01:49:08,223
- Use your body?
- Quick, before I change my mind.

1020
01:52:17,288 --> 01:52:19,957
- Molly, are you home?
- Carl.

1021
01:52:21,333 --> 01:52:23,836
- Molly!
- Fire escape.

1022
01:52:30,759 --> 01:52:32,636
What's happening to me?

1023
01:52:36,640 --> 01:52:40,227
Molly?

1024
01:52:49,194 --> 01:52:50,779
Molly!

1025
01:53:05,878 --> 01:53:07,504
Come on!

1026
01:53:10,507 --> 01:53:11,842
Look!

1027
01:53:13,135 --> 01:53:14,553
Let's go!

1028
01:53:25,189 --> 01:53:29,860
- Molly!
- Get away from us, Carl!

1029
01:53:32,196 --> 01:53:34,239
- Molly!
- You're just a liar.

1030
01:53:34,406 --> 01:53:37,910
This woman's a thief.
She's a con artist.

1031
01:53:38,077 --> 01:53:40,621
Why are you doing this?

1032
01:53:42,665 --> 01:53:44,792
Stop!

1033
01:53:44,959 --> 01:53:47,753
Get away from us.
I've called the police.

1034
01:53:57,596 --> 01:53:59,890
Shit!

1035
01:54:01,392 --> 01:54:04,395
- Carl, why are you doing this?
- She's a thief!

1036
01:54:07,106 --> 01:54:11,235
Just give me the cheque!

1037
01:54:18,284 --> 01:54:20,577
Stay out of this, Molly!

1038
01:54:20,786 --> 01:54:24,915
Get off me!

1039
01:54:28,752 --> 01:54:30,713
Where is it?

1040
01:54:30,921 --> 01:54:33,882
- Where is it, goddammit?
- I gave it away.

1041
01:54:34,091 --> 01:54:38,596
You're lying to me.
Don't lie to me, goddammit.

1042
01:54:40,848 --> 01:54:42,558
The cheque!

1043
01:54:54,862 --> 01:54:58,616
I'll kill her, Sam.
I swear to God, l'll kill her!

1044
01:55:08,250 --> 01:55:11,128
Just give me the cheque, Sam.

1045
01:55:11,337 --> 01:55:16,967
I promise you l'll let her go
if you just give it to me.

1046
01:56:38,549 --> 01:56:39,967
Sam?

1047
01:56:42,386 --> 01:56:44,054
Oh, Carl...

1048
01:56:44,221 --> 01:56:46,265
What?

1049
01:57:53,582 --> 01:57:56,085
Are you two all right?

1050
01:57:59,255 --> 01:58:01,548
Sam?

1051
01:58:03,300 --> 01:58:05,302
Molly?

1052
01:58:07,096 --> 01:58:09,473
I can hear you!

1053
01:58:45,134 --> 01:58:46,927
Oh, God!

1054
01:59:34,433 --> 01:59:36,060
Sam?

1055
01:59:36,810 --> 01:59:39,855
They're waiting for you.

1056
01:59:49,782 --> 01:59:52,910
I'll miss you.

1057
01:59:53,118 --> 01:59:54,912
Your motherd be proud.

1058
01:59:55,788 --> 02:00:00,417
I'm going to miss you too, Sam.
You're all right!

1059
02:00:02,044 --> 02:00:04,129
Bye, Oda Mae.

1060
02:00:04,922 --> 02:00:07,258
Bye, Sam.

1061
02:00:29,154 --> 02:00:31,490
I love you, Molly.

1062
02:00:33,200 --> 02:00:35,160
I've always loved you.

1063
02:00:42,001 --> 02:00:44,461
Ditto.

1064
02:01:04,440 --> 02:01:07,318
It's amazing, Molly.

1065
02:01:07,526 --> 02:01:11,655
The love inside - you take it with you.

1066
02:01:23,083 --> 02:01:25,085
See you.

1067
02:01:31,967 --> 02:01:33,969
See you.

1068
02:01:52,196 --> 02:01:53,405
Bye.
