1
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,998
Oh, but this is great.

2
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:51,042
- Wow!
- That's incredible.

3
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:54,292
There's gotta be at least seven
or eight feet up there.

4
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,214
And 80 years of dust.

5
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,633
Look at all this height.

6
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,532
We could put our bedroom upstairs,
and that will leave us with all this space.

7
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,888
- For what?
- Just space.

8
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:09,561
One, two, three!

9
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,899
- And four?
- Come on.

10
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:14,985
Four.

11
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:16,602
And five.

12
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,859
Watch... watch this.

13
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,237
God, this place is huge.

14
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:32,539
- You guys, it's absolutely incredible.
- Incredible.

15
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:34,873
A little paint.

16
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,956
I'd say you could sell this tomorrow
and double your money.

17
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,418
- Carl, you're obsessed.
- A little bit.

18
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,423
Whoa, look.

19
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,807
Hey, it's an Indian-head penny.

20
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,597
1898.

21
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:56,062
- It's a good omen.
- You're the good omen.

22
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,568
Oh, it's so great.

23
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:15,953
I had Rose move your 3:00
with Bob kahan to 4:00,

24
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,526
'cause Gary Alan called
at the end of the day yesterday

25
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,667
and said he has to see you
about the final painting bids for the loft.

26
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,969
3:00 is the only time he could make it.
Is that okay?

27
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,216
Sam?

28
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:29,554
What are you doing?

29
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:31,956
- Would you relax, man?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

30
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,437
This is not brain surgery
you're going into.

31
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,436
Pitching these Japanese guys
makes me so nervous.

32
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,524
Sam, you're going to be great. Okay?

33
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:43,843
I mean, what am I supposed to say?

34
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:47,530
I mean, I can't very well tell them my
Swedish pom-pom girl joke, you know.

35
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,974
Those are great.
Where'd you get those?

36
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:53,832
Nice, huh? Molly.
What do you think? Are they me?

37
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,664
Oh, man, look at that. A testarossa.

38
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,957
I think you ought to pay off
your mustang first.

39
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:13,226
How you feeling?
What'd the doctor say?

40
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,601
He said that it was contagious.
That it was really...

41
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,181
No. Yeah.

42
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:21,063
He said that I shouldn't even
be coming in today.

43
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,818
- What about the rash?
- The rash?

44
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,784
The rash is also incredibly contagious.

45
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,362
- He said they've both been spreading.
- No.

46
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:41,622
- On your genitals again?
- Yeah, yeah. Right on the genitals.

47
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:45,714
Basically everywhere.
He said that I shouldn't touch anyone.

48
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:48,803
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

49
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,467
- You're sick.
- I know.

50
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,679
- Good morning, Paul.
- Good morning, Carl. Sam.

51
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,229
Hey, Paul.

52
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,142
- Morning, Mr. wheat.
- Morning, Susan. You are looking good.

53
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:02,316
Sam.

54
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,235
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

55
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:08,190
- Here it is.
- Thanks.

56
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,819
- Good morning, Sam.
- Good morning, Rose.

57
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,997
- Oh, listen, the kobiashi people...
- They're already here.

58
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,245
- They're early.
- I know.

59
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,621
Come here.

60
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:20,773
Oh, and Andy Dillon called...

61
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,958
- How long have they been here?
- About 10 minutes.

62
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,505
Andy Dillon called and he says

63
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:27,460
he needs $900,000 transferred
to Albany by 10:00.

64
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:28,964
By 10:00? Yes.

65
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,050
Excuse me.

66
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,806
Carl? Yeah?

67
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:35,884
- Good morning.
- Carl.

68
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,469
Bill, hang on one second.

69
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:40,397
Dillon needs $900,000
in Albany by 10:00.

70
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,086
Can you transfer it
to his payroll account?

71
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,601
- Yeah, I'm gonna need your Mac code.
- Okay.

72
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,947
- Discretion, right?
- Got it.

73
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,211
- You bet. I'll do it right now.
- Okay, thanks.

74
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,078
Yeah. Bill, I'm going to
call you back. Okay.

75
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,796
Okay, okay, that's fine.
It's fine. It's fine!

76
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,637
Man, it's too far out.

77
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,727
Can you get this, man?

78
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,186
Where are you guys from,
the New York City ballet?

79
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:29,988
Almost.

80
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:38,117
- Saved your life.
- You shit. You scared me to death.

81
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,243
Why did you do that?

82
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:42,576
It's better than seeing this gorgeous
body splattered all over the place.

83
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,377
Look out. Look out.

84
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,595
Grab it.

85
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,592
- Sam, mol, are you guys home?
- That's Carl. Did you invite him?

86
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,389
- Slave labor.
- Carl.

87
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,761
- What?
- Hurry, help.

88
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,137
Oh, my god.

89
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,435
- Near the bottom.
- L1 got it.

90
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:01,791
Now go down.
What? Just down here?

91
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:02,895
Yeah.

92
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,981
- Just right here?
- Watch your toes.

93
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,069
I got it.

94
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,650
- Hey, where do you want this?
- In the bedroom.

95
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,356
Good girl.

96
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:16,276
God, this place looks great.
Yeah.

97
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,158
- You like it, huh?
- Like? Like is hardly the word.

98
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,831
I had no idea it'd be this beautiful.
It's incredible.

99
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,328
Molly, what about her?

100
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,107
Well, why don't we just leave her there
until we get the other stuff in?

101
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,650
We can figure out...
“What are these?

102
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,164
Oh, let me show you.

103
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,695
Hey, you wanna help me lift this up?

104
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,255
What, here? Yeah.

105
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:34,888
Wow.

106
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:38,636
- I just finished it. What do you think?
- It's fantastic. I love it.

107
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,052
Sam, what's this chair doing here?

108
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,668
- What do you mean? I love that chair.
- I know you love this chair.

109
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:48,399
- But we discussed this and...
- Yeah, I've had it forever.

110
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,148
I mean just, when I watch TV, I sit in it.

111
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,480
- Baby, this chair is ugly.
- So?

112
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:56,408
- And it doesn't go with anything.
- It goes with me.

113
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,652
You're right. It does.

114
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,243
We'll paint it. We'll what?

115
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:16,507
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

116
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,806
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

117
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,483
Are you worried about the promotion?

118
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,236
No, not really.

119
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:48,122
- Then what? Is it moving in together?
- No.

120
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,922
I don't know. It's a lot of things.

121
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,640
I just don't want the bubble to burst.

122
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,803
It seems like

123
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,766
whenever anything good
in my life happens,

124
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,477
I'm just afraid I'm going to lose it.

125
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:23,320
I love you. I really love you.

126
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,207
Ditto.

127
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,527
The pilot's first report of trouble was
that he blew the number two engine,

128
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:38,009
the one in the tail of the plane.
It was fully loaded.

129
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,796
Oh, Jesus, another one.

130
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,890
Oh, don't watch that.

131
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,019
I should cancel my la trip.
These things always happen in threes.

132
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:56,695
Sam, get serious.
Besides, you lead a charmed life.

133
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,151
Oh, yeah. So did they.

134
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,278
It's amazing, just like that. Blackout.

135
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,270
- What are you doing?
- I couldn't sleep.

136
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:23,277
Boy, I really must have passed out.

137
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:27,451
- What time is it?
- It's 2:00 A.M.

138
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:55,601
Oh, no. I hope it wasn't a masterpiece.

139
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,648
Well, it's not now.

140
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,316
Can I help? Yeah.

141
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,773
Put your hands up here. Get them wet.

142
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:10,787
Now, just let the Clay slide
between your fingers.

143
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,089
Oh, no.

144
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:11,672
- What's the matter?
- A glitch. What's up?

145
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,296
The Mark Greenberg
and Larry white accounts.

146
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,030
I can't get in.
The Mac code doesn't work.

147
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,512
- No, I changed it.
- You changed it? Why?

148
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,719
Nothing. I just want
to nose around a bit.

149
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,349
Is something wrong?

150
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:28,526
- Can you keep a secret?
- Yeah, sure.

151
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:30,937
What's up?

152
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:32,943
There's too much money
in these accounts.

153
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:35,821
Too much money?
That's impossible. How could there be...

154
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:41,164
C72273.

155
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,038
Sam, this is going to take you hours.
Let me do this.

156
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,790
It already has taken me hours.

157
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:49,122
Well, let me take it back
and figure it out for you.

158
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:52,209
No, no, that's okay.
It's... it's like a vendetta now.

159
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:55,295
- Thanks, though. I appreciate it.
- Okay.

160
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,882
- If you start to go blind, just shout.
- Okay.

161
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:04,224
Listen, I was wondering,
what are you and mol doing tonight?

162
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:07,273
We're going to the theater.
She wants to see MacBeth.

163
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,983
I think she likes the guys in tights,
personally.

164
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:12,062
- You want to go?
- No, thanks.

165
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,029
I want a full report, though.

166
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,526
Later. Yeah.

167
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,114
Wonderful.

168
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,036
Excellent. Great.

169
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,247
Well, I loved it. Yes.

170
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,325
I was spellbound the whole time.

171
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,454
I could tell.

172
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:30,710
And so could the rest of the audience
with that resonating snore of yours.

173
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,717
Did I tell you what Melissa said?

174
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:41,556
- Yeah, about six times.
- It wasn't six times.

175
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:44,602
- Now quit being so blasé about this.
- Okay.

176
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:46,020
Now, this is really important.

177
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:48,473
I'm gonna have two pieces
in her gallery.

178
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:51,560
The New York times
reviews her gallery all the time.

179
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,647
Molly, the New York times
is just some frustrated little critic

180
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,719
with pimples on his ass
who flunked out of art school.

181
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,608
So who cares what they think?

182
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:02,783
About eight million readers, that's who.

183
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,618
Nah, they're just reading
the sports page.

184
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:10,582
- Your work is really beautiful. It really is.
- Thanks.

185
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:15,254
And it shouldn't matter what
anyone else thinks. Just what I think.

186
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:23,008
I want to marry you, Sam.

187
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:26,557
What? What?

188
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,054
Yep.

189
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,936
I've been thinking about it.

190
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:35,737
I've been thinking about it a lot,
and I think we should just do it.

191
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:39,649
You're serious. Yeah.

192
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,367
What's that look for?

193
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,162
You never wanted to talk about it.

194
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:07,014
- Do you love me, Sam?
- Now, what do you think?

195
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,767
Why don't you ever say it?

196
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,498
What do you mean,
why don't I ever say it?

197
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,504
- I say it all the time. I feel like...
- No, you don't.

198
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:17,235
You say, "ditto,"
and that's not the same.

199
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:23,697
People say "I love you" all the time,
and it doesn't mean anything.

200
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,332
You know,
sometimes you need to hear it.

201
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,327
I need to hear it.

202
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,289
Let's go.

203
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,724
- What should we do?
- Let me handle it.

204
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:48,852
- What do you want?
- Shit.

205
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,394
Your wallet. Give it to me!

206
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:56,234
- Sam, just give it to him.
- Okay.

207
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,815
Just take the money. Just leave us...

208
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,316
No, no, Sam!

209
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,489
You son of a bitch!

210
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,494
Sam, no!

211
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,663
Somebody help us!

212
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,615
Jesus Christ! Sam!

213
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,002
Just get off!

214
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:18,206
Somebody! Somebody help us!

215
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,957
Sam, just let...

216
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:24,470
Sam, just stop it! Stop it, Sam!

217
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,150
Molly?

218
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,120
Molly? He got...

219
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,551
Oh, baby, hold on.

220
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,046
You're gonna be okay.

221
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:14,308
Somebody! Somebody!
Somebody help us!

222
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,604
Sam. Oh, my god.

223
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:22,695
Oh, Sam, come on. Hold on, baby.

224
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:27,741
Someone's gonna come.
We're gonna be okay.

225
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:43,917
Somebody! Somebody help me!
Please, anybody.

226
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:46,009
Help me, please, help me.

227
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:48,241
It's okay, lady. Take it easy, all right?

228
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,596
Oh, god!

229
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,507
We'll help you, okay?

230
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:54,389
Molly? Molly? Molly?

231
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:01,694
Molly.

232
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:04,403
What should we do?
What should we do?

233
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,749
What? What's happening? What's...

234
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:20,036
Is he breathing?

235
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:25,049
Is he breathing?
I don't know if he's breathing.

236
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,631
Oh, god, Sam, hold on.

237
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,383
Hold on, baby. Hold on.

238
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:31,923
Oh, my god.

239
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,403
Come on, man.

240
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:52,389
All right. Okay, come on, it's all right.

241
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:53,619
Here we go.

242
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,863
All right, there you go. One, two...

243
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:03,125
Sam, don't you leave me! Sam, hold on!

244
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,630
Sam!

245
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,003
Oh, Sam!

246
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:29,480
Emergency room.

247
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,094
All right. Right away.

248
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,804
Miss Jensen,
if you'll step this way, please.

249
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:09,858
Cardiology, please dial extension 255...

250
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:20,661
So, what happened to you? “What?

251
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,208
You're new, huh? I can tell.

252
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,336
- Are you talking to me?
- Hey, relax.

253
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:30,211
It ain't like before, you know.
It's a whole new ball of wax.

254
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:32,926
- Who are you?
- Oh, I'm waiting for my wife.

255
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:36,597
She's in 4c, cardiac wing.
She's fighting it.

256
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:49,106
Shot, huh? That'll do it every time.

257
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:51,900
Poor bastard.

258
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,277
Hey, you may as well get used to it.

259
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,571
You could be here for a long while.

260
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:03,290
Come here, I'll tell you a secret.

261
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:06,961
Doors ain't as bad as you think.
Zip, zap, they ain't nothing at all.

262
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,787
You'll see. You'll catch on.

263
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,622
This patient's fibrillating.

264
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:14,092
Where's the paddles?
Get them up here.

265
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,464
He ain't gonna make it.

266
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:18,389
I've seen it a million times.
He's a goner.

267
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,302
- He's still fibrillating.
- Clear.

268
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:21,759
Clear.

269
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:27,272
You see? Here they come.

270
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:32,903
Lucky bastard.

271
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:37,158
It could have been the other ones.
You never know.

272
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,557
Who are...

273
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,552
Nursing supervisor,
dial the operator, please.

274
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:04,180
Nursing supervisor, dial the operator.

275
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,220
No!

276
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:15,948
Help me.

277
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:20,492
Oh, god, help me.

278
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:30,457
"Li am sunk in the abysmal swamp
where there is no foothold.

279
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:34,172
"I have reached the watery depths.

280
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,834
"The flood overwhelms me.

281
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,677
"I am wearied with calling."

282
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:44,767
As we say farewell
to our friend Sam wheat,

283
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,894
we are reminded of his kindness,

284
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:53,018
his generosity, his buoyancy of spirit.

285
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:58,572
All that we treasure, our loved ones,

286
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:03,323
our friends, our body, our mind,

287
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,367
are but on loan to us.

288
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:09,245
We must surrender them all.

289
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:15,794
We are all travelers on the same road
which leads to the same end.

290
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:25,721
As our loved one enters eternal life,
let us remember that love too is eternal.

291
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:30,096
That although we will miss him,

292
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:33,682
our love will light the void
and dispel the darkness.

293
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:16,225
I picked up your shirts today.

294
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,569
I don't know why.

295
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:26,944
Mr. Reynolds told me to tell you hello.

296
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,449
I broke into tears.

297
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:38,084
It's like I think about you every minute.

298
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:42,001
It's like I can still feel you.

299
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:53,228
I'm here, mol.

300
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:05,991
Floyd, what's the matter, kitty?
What's the matter?

301
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:09,031
Crazy cat.

302
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:14,537
Sam?

303
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,333
That's really stupid.

304
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:33,973
- I love this picture.
- It's great.

305
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:35,930
Office.

306
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,815
Oh, let me see that.

307
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,945
It's...

308
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:50,277
- Sam's address book.
- Right.

309
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,618
Dave brubeck, Newport, '88.

310
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:00,670
- Should I toss them?
- No.

311
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:02,923
No? Molly, we hated that concert.

312
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,046
Hey.

313
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:09,672
- Oh, you wanted to save those?
- Rolaids?

314
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,507
Molly, what are you doing?

315
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:25,237
- I just miss him, Carl.
- Me, too.

316
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:30,325
Carl? Yeah?

317
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:32,368
Wait a minute. Wait.

318
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:34,196
- What?
- Not that one.

319
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,452
Which? Oh, I'm sorry.

320
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:39,535
- I didn't mean to put that on there.
- That's okay.

321
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:44,374
Hey, Molly, why don't you come?
It's like summer outside.

322
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,296
No, I really don't. I... I'm not up for it.

323
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:48,587
Come on, mol, just for a walk.

324
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,533
- It'd be good for you to get out.
- I don't want to.

325
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:53,094
Molly, you can't stay in here all day.

326
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:56,222
- It's not healthy for you.
- Look, Carl, I can't do it!

327
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,391
Molly, you're not the one who died.

328
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:05,398
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize.

329
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:07,904
Shit.

330
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,409
Maybe you're right.

331
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:16,739
- Maybe just a short one.
- Attagirl.

332
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:22,165
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

333
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,495
Molly?

334
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,979
What are you doing here?

335
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,148
You bastard.

336
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,944
You son of a bitch!

337
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:52,209
What do you want?

338
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,170
Molly?

339
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,052
Molly, get out!

340
00:32:58,143 --> 00:32:59,474
Oh, my god.

341
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:08,442
No, Molly. No, Molly, no, no. Please, no.

342
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:13,026
Molly, Molly, he's got a gun. Molly!

343
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,856
Hi, kitty. Hi.

344
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,109
You hurt her, I'll kill...

345
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,037
Molly.

346
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:45,731
Shit.

347
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:51,855
Is somebody there? Hello?

348
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:54,987
Hello?

349
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:11,314
What are you doing?

350
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:15,101
Let go! What are you doing?

351
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:17,615
No!

352
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:22,325
Like trains?

353
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:35,167
Stay out! This is mine!

354
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:53,867
Shit.

355
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:09,216
It's me. I couldn't get it.
She came home.

356
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:13,186
In a couple of days, man. I'll go back.

357
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:20,060
Get what?

358
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:25,740
Who are you?
What do you want from us?

359
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:34,658
No. You stay away from her.

360
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:37,873
Do you hear me?

361
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:40,547
You stay away from her!

362
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:44,402
Rosa Santiago?

363
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,201
Please be seated.

364
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:10,845
Our sister will be with us soon.

365
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:19,688
Sister oda Mae, Grant us the gift
of your all-seeing presence.

366
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:22,190
Appear before us now.

367
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,735
Mrs. Santiago?

368
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:34,159
I'm oda Mae brown.

369
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:37,155
I understand you wish
to contact your husband.

370
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,623
I believe he'll be with us today.

371
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:42,578
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

372
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:45,004
But you know, Mrs. Santiago,

373
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:48,253
there's no telling about that other world.

374
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:51,337
So you've got to be a believer,
Mrs. Santiago.

375
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:56,266
Are you a believer?
Si si I believe. I believe.

376
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:57,762
Then let us begin.

377
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:23,243
I can't. I can't. It's too difficult.

378
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:27,956
I just can't seem to make contact.
I... I don't feel his... no, wait!

379
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:30,917
I'm feeling something.

380
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:36,007
Did he know someone
by the name of Anna?

381
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:42,554
Consuelo? Lucita? Julietta?

382
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:45,857
Josephina? Linda? Maria?

383
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:49,562
Si, si. His mama. She is Maria.

384
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:53,820
Yes. Praise god!
I knew he was with his mama.

385
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:55,653
Oh, my god.

386
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:05,126
It's too difficult. It's two of them.
I'm not sure I can do that.

387
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:08,751
- It's so trying... it's...
- Oh, I pay more.

388
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:11,799
- How much? How much?
- $20.

389
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:14,298
Oh, way to go. Milk her for every penny.

390
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:36,149
Yes, I believe we can start again.

391
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:53,712
Praise the lord. Thank you, Jesus.

392
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:12,189
Welcome, Mrs. Santiago.

393
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:15,612
You're fortunate today.
The spirits are churning.

394
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,986
- My husband?
- Have mercy!

395
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:20,193
Oh, yeah? Where?

396
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,451
Julio? Yes.

397
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:29,753
I feel his vibration.

398
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,335
I see him!

399
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:35,754
How is he? How does he look?

400
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:37,756
Oh, he's a handsome man.

401
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,797
Handsome?

402
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:45,764
Mrs. Santiago, in our father's kingdom,
we're all handsome.

403
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,061
Oh, Julio.

404
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:51,182
Julio's coming towards us. I see him!

405
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:54,940
He's coming! He's there!

406
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,570
He's dressed in a black suit.

407
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:03,740
Black suit?

408
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:06,990
Could be blue.

409
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,622
What a crock of shit.

410
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:12,040
- Who is that?
- Julio?

411
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:14,167
Where are you? Julio? Julio?

412
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,544
Did you hear it? Damn.

413
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:18,422
- Where are you?
- Julio?

414
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:20,128
Who are you? “Who?

415
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:22,221
Julio? Julio?

416
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:25,175
- You can hear me?
- Don't you hear him?

417
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,269
I don't believe this.

418
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,720
Hey, you! Hey, you!
My name is Sam wheat.

419
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:31,227
Listen, can you hear me? Sam wheat.
Say my name. Say it.

420
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:33,629
- Leave me alone! Stop it!
- Say my name. Say it! Sam wheat.

421
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:35,393
Say my name. Sam wheat. Say it.

422
00:43:35,488 --> 00:43:37,103
Talk to me, oda Mae. Say something.

423
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:38,813
Sam wheat!

424
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:42,828
Jesus.

425
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:44,569
- Sam wheat?
- Sam wheat?

426
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:48,373
I swear, no more cheating. I promise.
I'll do anything. I'll do penance.

427
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:49,812
Give me penance,
but make that guy go away.

428
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:51,121
No way.

429
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,172
It's okay.

430
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:03,763
It's okay.

431
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:07,595
All right, sister.

432
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,803
- I can't...
- Yeah, you're all right.

433
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:13,314
My mother had it.
And my mother's mother had it.

434
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:15,107
They... they both had the gift.

435
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:18,857
And they always said I had it,
but I never did. I never had it.

436
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:22,819
They told me what it was like.
They told me all about it.

437
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:25,242
But now that I got it, I...
I don't think I want it.

438
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,945
So, do me a favor, just go away.
Find somebody else.

439
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,621
Somebody else?
You're out of your mind.

440
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:30,949
Yeah, I'm getting there fast.

441
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:33,250
Well, I think she hit her head
harder than we think.

442
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:35,190
Well, she was talking to nobody
that wasn't there

443
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:36,358
before she even hit her head.

444
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:38,360
Well, I know she is.
But you know, sister can do that.

445
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:41,547
- Where exactly are you?
- I'm standing right beside you.

446
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:46,715
- Oh, you're standing right beside me?
- Well, honey, we're right here.

447
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:49,346
Are you white? “What?

448
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:51,553
- White?
- You're white, aren't you?

449
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:53,012
Oh, god, you know what I think?

450
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,938
Yes, I'm gonna call the doctor right now.

451
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:58,484
- I knew it. It's a white guy. Why me?
- Listen, damn it.

452
00:44:58,571 --> 00:45:00,937
You are going to help me.
There's a woman.

453
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:04,069
Her name is Molly Jensen,
and she's in terrible danger.

454
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,994
The man who killed me broke into
our apartment and he's gonna go back.

455
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,536
So you've gotta warn her.

456
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:11,831
Just what makes you think
she's gonna listen to me?

457
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:13,909
It's just a phone call.

458
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:17,457
Look,

459
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,041
you're all I've got.

460
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:25,048
Now, I'm not leaving until you help me.

461
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:30,057
I don't care how long it takes,
'cause I can talk forever.

462
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:34,078
She's talking to white people
in the room.

463
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:45,440
- Hello?
- Hi.

464
00:45:45,618 --> 00:45:47,904
- Is this Molly Jensen?
- Yes.

465
00:45:48,371 --> 00:45:52,080
Well, my name is oda Mae brown.
I'm a spiritual reader and advisor,

466
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,327
and a friend of yours gave me
a message for you.

467
00:45:54,794 --> 00:45:56,563
Now, I know this
is gonna sound a little crazy,

468
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:59,954
but it's not, and you gotta believe me.
Just don't be afraid.

469
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:01,793
Who is this?

470
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:03,791
I got a message from Sam.

471
00:46:06,264 --> 00:46:07,299
What?

472
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:09,676
Sam wheat. He asked me to call.

473
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,719
- I told you.
- You gotta go there.

474
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:17,851
Forget it. I'm not going anywhere.
I don't care what you do.

475
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:21,059
Second verse same as the first

476
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:23,690
I'm Henry viii, I am

477
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:26,067
Henry viii, I am, I am

478
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:28,865
I got married to the widow next door

479
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:31,239
she's been married seven times before

480
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:34,072
and every one was an Henry
Henry!

481
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,656
She wouldn't have a Willie or a Sam

482
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:36,751
no, sir!

483
00:46:36,836 --> 00:46:39,122
I'm her eighth old man, I'm Henry

484
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,750
Henry viii, I am, I am

485
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:44,423
Henry viii, I am

486
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,842
second verse same as the first

487
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:49,545
I'm Henry viii, I am

488
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,972
Henry viii, I am, I am

489
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,550
I got married to the widow next door

490
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,510
all right, all right, all right!
Stop singing!

491
00:46:56,605 --> 00:47:00,018
I'll go anywhere you want to!
Just don't sing anymore!

492
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:07,113
I can't believe this.

493
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:09,594
I can't believe I'm doing this.
What am I doing down here?

494
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:12,234
I never come downtown.
I hate downtown.

495
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,537
She's probably not even there.

496
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:16,114
Where are you?

497
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:20,701
Which building is it?

498
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:24,205
- Which one?
- Push three.

499
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:28,071
- See? Nobody's there.
- She's there. Just wait. Just wait.

500
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:30,757
Look, no. I came down here,
I did everything I said I was gonna do.

501
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,784
I pressed the button. She's not there.
I'm gone. Goodbye.

502
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:34,077
- Just wait one minute.
- I'm sorry.

503
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,538
Ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall
ninety-nine bottles of beer

504
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:37,972
take one down and pass it around

505
00:47:38,064 --> 00:47:41,147
all right, don't sing!
All right, all right, all right!

506
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:42,973
- Hello?
- Yes, hi.

507
00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:44,104
She can't hear you.

508
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:45,776
Hi, I'm oda Mae.

509
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:49,230
You know, I called you last night
about your friend Sam wheat.

510
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:51,736
I told you.

511
00:47:58,417 --> 00:47:59,907
Hey, Molly!

512
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:03,494
Molly Jensen, I know you're up there!
I know you hear me! I'm down here!

513
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:06,251
Sam wants to talk to you!
This is for reall

514
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:10,509
hey, you remember the starfish
in montego bay?

515
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:12,962
How would I know that
if he wasn't here?

516
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:14,846
Hey, Molly!

517
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:17,721
I know about the green underwear
that you wrote your name on!

518
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:20,428
I'd never get over that,
I'll tell you that.

519
00:48:20,773 --> 00:48:24,812
I know about the picture in Reno.
Hey, Molly!

520
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:31,356
Ask her about the sweater she knitted,
in the closet, that's too big.

521
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:34,154
He just asked me
to remind you of the sweater

522
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:37,203
that's in the closet
that you knitted is too big!

523
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:38,821
Four sizes!

524
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:43,534
Hey, you hear me talking to you?

525
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:46,166
- I hear you.
- Oh, shut up. Nobody's talking to you.

526
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:47,667
Didn't you ever hear of a phone?

527
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:49,590
Wanna kiss my butt?

528
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,710
- I'm not gonna stay down here all day!
- Thank god.

529
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:54,466
Oh, man, shut up!

530
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:56,551
Molly!

531
00:48:57,393 --> 00:48:59,884
I'm gonna count to three,
and then I'm out of here.

532
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:01,310
One, two, three.

533
00:49:02,565 --> 00:49:04,476
- No, oda. Wait.
- No.

534
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:06,644
It's Molly.

535
00:49:13,826 --> 00:49:15,032
Molly?

536
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:19,995
I'm oda Mae brown.

537
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:26,835
I don't know you.
I don't know this guy, Sam.

538
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:28,442
But let me tell you what he did to me.

539
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:31,715
He kept me up all night singing
I'm Henry viii, I am.

540
00:49:32,845 --> 00:49:35,211
That's how he got me
to go out with him.

541
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,346
Look, I'm sorry.

542
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:42,434
I just don't believe
in this life-after-death stuff.

543
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:45,855
- Well, tell her she's wrong.
- He says you're wrong.

544
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:49,229
You're talking to him right now?
Yeah.

545
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:52,107
He just asked me to tell you
that you were wrong.

546
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:56,236
- So, where is he?
- I can't see him. I can only hear him.

547
00:49:58,287 --> 00:49:59,572
I'm right here.

548
00:49:59,872 --> 00:50:01,487
That doesn't help, Sam.

549
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:04,949
I'm holding her hand.

550
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:07,744
He says he's holding your hand.

551
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:19,630
What are you doing?

552
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,307
What do you think you're doing to me?

553
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,789
Hey, look, if you think I'd come
all the way down here for my health,

554
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:25,848
you're out of your mind.

555
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:28,431
Sam's dead. Okay? He's dead.

556
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,647
- Tell her I love her.
- He says he loves you.

557
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,571
Sam would never say that.

558
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:38,282
Ditto! Tell her ditto.

559
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:40,451
What the hell 1s ditto? Ditto!

560
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:14,109
Man, to tell you the truth,
I don't know how I'm doing this.

561
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:17,814
You know, confidentially, nothing like
this has ever happened to me before.

562
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,364
I mean, nothing.

563
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:21,658
And now I can't turn it off.

564
00:51:23,956 --> 00:51:25,662
Is this him? Is this you?

565
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:26,955
Yeah. Yeah.

566
00:51:27,668 --> 00:51:30,034
Cute. White, but cute.

567
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:34,088
What I don't understand is
why did he come back?

568
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:36,798
- I don't know.
- Why is he still here?

569
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:40,841
He's stuck, that's what it is.
He's in between worlds.

570
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:44,674
You know, it happens sometimes.
The spirit gets yanked out so quick

571
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,885
that the essence still feels
like it has work to do here.

572
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:50,346
- Would you stop rambling?
- I don't think I'm rambling.

573
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:52,022
I'm just answering her question.

574
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:54,725
- He's got an attitude now.
- I don't have an attitude.

575
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,732
Yes, you do have an attitude.
We're having a little discussion.

576
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,484
If you didn't have an attitude,

577
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:01,720
you would not have raised
your voice to me, now, would you?

578
00:52:01,744 --> 00:52:03,826
- God damn it, oda Mae.
- Don't you "god damn it" me.

579
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:06,308
Don't you take the lord's name in vain
with me, you understand?

580
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:07,475
- I don't take that.
- Would you relax?

581
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:09,035
No, you relax. You're the dead guy.

582
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,520
You want me to help you?
You better apologize.

583
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:12,397
- Because I don't take that from anybody.
- Jesus Christ!

584
00:52:12,421 --> 00:52:13,732
- That's it, I'm leaving.
- What are you doing?

585
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:17,214
I'm leaving. Nobody talks to me like that.
You understand me?

586
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:22,170
- Now you better apologize.
- I'm sorry. I apologize. Okay?

587
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:26,720
Now would you sit down? Please?

588
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,513
He's apologized.

589
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:32,309
I need you to tell Molly what I'm saying,

590
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:35,436
but you have to tell her
word for word, all right?

591
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:38,018
Word for word. Yes.

592
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:41,776
He wants me to tell you
what he's saying word for word.

593
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:48,741
Molly, you're in danger.

594
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:52,120
Now you can't just blurt it out like that.
And quit moving around, will you?

595
00:52:52,211 --> 00:52:53,605
'Cause you're starting
to make me dizzy.

596
00:52:53,629 --> 00:52:55,711
I'll just tell her in my own way.

597
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:59,381
Molly, you in danger, girl.

598
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:03,135
What are you talking about?

599
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:04,678
I know the man who killed me.

600
00:53:04,765 --> 00:53:06,045
He knows the man who killed him.

601
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:08,933
His name is Willie Lopez,
and I know where he lives.

602
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,759
His name is Willie Lopez.
He's puerto rican.

603
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:11,889
He knows where he lives.

604
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,667
- Write it down.
- He wants you to write it down.

605
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:16,057
- You write it down.
- I ain't no damn secretary.

606
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:17,516
Just do it!

607
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:21,695
He's so testy.

608
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:24,010
What is it you want me to write?

609
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:27,197
It's 303 prospect place, apartment 4d.

610
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:30,117
303 prospect place? Yeah.

611
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:32,410
That's my neighborhood.

612
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:37,336
Molly, he's got my wallet,
he's got my key, and he was in here.

613
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:39,567
He's got his wallet and his key,
and he was in here.

614
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:41,528
Yesterday when you came back
from your walk with Carl,

615
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:43,071
you went up the stairs,
you talked to Floyd,

616
00:53:43,095 --> 00:53:45,115
- you went in, took off your clothes...
- All right, all right.

617
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:47,846
When you came in yesterday
from your walk with Carl, he was here.

618
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:50,174
You took your clothes off.
He saw everything.

619
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:53,136
Molly, you got to go to the police.
It was a set-up.

620
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:54,598
I was murdered.

621
00:53:56,108 --> 00:53:57,252
He wants you to go to the police.

622
00:53:57,276 --> 00:53:59,232
He said it was a set-up.
He was murdered.

623
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:01,089
- There's somebody else involved.
- Look, forget it.

624
00:54:01,113 --> 00:54:02,799
- I don't know who, but...
- I don't want no more

625
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:04,814
to do with this, okay? Wait.

626
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,928
- Where are you going?
- What do you mean, where am I going?

627
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:08,888
I'm leaving.
I did everything I said I was going to do.

628
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:11,403
And don't be following me,
'cause I'm finished. And I mean it.

629
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:14,581
Have a nice life.
Have a nice death. Goodbye.

630
00:54:18,464 --> 00:54:20,830
Molly, there's no one
on earth besides you

631
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,755
who'd want this to be true
more than me.

632
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:25,710
But you've got to be rational about this.

633
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,762
I mean, Sam is no more
in this room than...

634
00:54:30,142 --> 00:54:34,977
Look, I understand the need
to hang on to him.

635
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:37,975
I really do. But this is absurd.

636
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:42,105
I know this seems absurd.
But it had to be real.

637
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:44,215
How could you believe
some fortuneteller from Brooklyn

638
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:45,979
who just shows up at your door?

639
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:49,237
I sat there and watched her
have a conversation with him.

640
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:51,948
I don't buy it, mol. Not for a minute.

641
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:55,497
- What about the things she knew?
- What things?

642
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:59,038
The photo that Sam took of me
on our trip to Reno.

643
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:00,828
Carl, we were alone.

644
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:05,045
And the green underwear
that I wrote my name in.

645
00:55:08,347 --> 00:55:11,839
She said Sam knew who killed him.
Yeah.

646
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:15,392
- That he was set up.
- This is getting deranged.

647
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:17,310
We're going off the deep end here.

648
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:19,638
- She had a name and an address.
- Good, Molly, good.

649
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:23,021
Willie Lopez.
303 prospect place, apartment 4d.

650
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:26,611
This is sick.

651
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:27,813
Oh, Carl.

652
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:29,523
This is really sick.

653
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:32,328
Oh, god.

654
00:55:33,205 --> 00:55:35,571
Molly, I don't understand how you could

655
00:55:38,544 --> 00:55:42,332
swallow this crap.
I mean, this guy may not even exist.

656
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:46,711
This woman, maybe she's just trying
to use you to set someone up.

657
00:55:48,554 --> 00:55:51,546
You're right. You're absolutely right.

658
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:53,015
No.

659
00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:55,136
That's what I got to find out.

660
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:57,642
What do you mean, find out?
How are you gonna do that?

661
00:55:57,729 --> 00:56:00,015
Well, she said Sam wants me
to go to the police.

662
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:02,564
Sam wants you to go to the police?

663
00:56:03,402 --> 00:56:04,562
Jesus, Molly.

664
00:56:05,404 --> 00:56:06,484
Are you out of your mind?

665
00:56:06,572 --> 00:56:07,966
I mean,
what are you gonna tell the police?

666
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:11,153
Are you gonna tell them
that some storefront psychic lady's

667
00:56:11,243 --> 00:56:12,699
been communing with the dead?

668
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,472
I mean, do you have any idea
what that sounds like?

669
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:17,033
You're talking ghosts here,
for Christ's sake.

670
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:20,327
I'm sorry.

671
00:56:20,669 --> 00:56:23,376
It's just this stuff just
really gets to me, you know.

672
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:25,670
It's okay if you don't believe me.

673
00:56:25,966 --> 00:56:27,502
I'm trying to, Molly.

674
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:38,893
Look, if it'll make you feel any better,
I'll go check this out, okay?

675
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:42,934
Now, why don't you try
and get some sleep?

676
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:46,524
Okay? All right?

677
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,340
- I'll call you in the morning.
- Okay.

678
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:50,900
All right. Good night.

679
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:19,470
Be careful.

680
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:37,033
Carl. What the hell are you doing here?

681
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:41,575
Who have you been talking to, Willie?

682
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:43,658
Talking to? What the hell do you mean?

683
00:57:43,752 --> 00:57:46,243
Some woman knows
all about you, everything.

684
00:57:46,338 --> 00:57:49,580
- Now where's she getting it from, huh?
- I haven't said a word to anybody.

685
00:57:49,675 --> 00:57:52,667
She knows your name, god damn it.
She knows where you live.

686
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:55,753
- A lot of women know where I live.
- This is not a joke!

687
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:57,633
She knows about the murder.

688
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:02,642
Now I want you to find this bitch,
whoever she is.

689
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:08,395
And I want you
to just get rid of her, okay?

690
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:13,730
I've got $4 million stuck
in a goddamn computer.

691
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:19,781
If I don't get those codes,
if that money is not transferred soon,

692
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:26,120
I'm... dead. We're both dead.

693
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:28,011
Why don't you tell them
you only launder money

694
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:29,669
on the first of the month?

695
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:32,088
What the hell is wrong with you?

696
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:35,713
Is everything a joke? You killed a man.

697
00:58:35,804 --> 00:58:38,090
You were supposed to steal his wallet.
Was that a joke?

698
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:41,389
Man, I did you a favor, man.
That was a freebie.

699
00:58:42,561 --> 00:58:45,394
Look, these are drug dealers, okay?

700
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:50,975
Just don't blow this for me, Willie.
I'd lose my job. I could go to jail.

701
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:53,978
$80,000 of that money is mine.

702
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:01,823
Look, just let me have the key
to Sam's apartment.

703
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:04,279
I'll get the address book myself, okay?

704
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:36,479
Bastard! You goddamn bastard!
Why? Why? You were my friend!

705
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:43,115
I had a life, god damn you. I had a life!

706
00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:54,796
Look, I don't even believe
in this stuff myself.

707
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:56,999
But she was real.

708
00:59:58,053 --> 01:00:01,170
What? You think I'd come down here
if it wasn't real?

709
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:07,392
You know, you told me if I had
any new information that I should come.

710
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:09,386
So here I am.

711
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:15,225
I know how this sounds.

712
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:19,029
I mean, I hear myself saying it
and I want to cringe.

713
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:22,817
But this woman knew things
she couldn't have known.

714
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:25,410
Things Sam only said to me.

715
01:00:25,497 --> 01:00:28,830
Okay, according to this psychic lady,

716
01:00:28,917 --> 01:00:33,160
there are ghosts and spirits
all over the place,

717
01:00:33,255 --> 01:00:35,496
watching us all the time, huh?

718
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:41,460
Well, hell, I'm never gonna
get undressed again.

719
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:45,297
Excuse me.
I've got more important things to do.

720
01:00:56,862 --> 01:00:59,103
The guy's name is Willie Lopez.

721
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:01,688
All I'm asking you to do is check it out.

722
01:01:02,534 --> 01:01:03,534
Okay.

723
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:08,116
You just wait here and let me see
if the guy's got a record, all right?

724
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,537
Great.

725
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,267
What are you doing?

726
01:02:14,189 --> 01:02:17,397
- Where's the file on Willie Lopez?
- There's no file for a Willie Lopez.

727
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:21,443
He was probably some old boyfriend
she was trying to get even with.

728
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:25,151
Now, this psychic woman's got a record
that goes back a long way.

729
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:32,789
1967, shreveport,
forgery, selling false ID.

730
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:34,205
Served one year in 1971.

731
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:38,205
Baton Rouge, arrested for fraud.

732
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:42,335
Numbers racketeering,
served 10 months, 1974, and...

733
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:44,131
Look, this is impossible.

734
01:02:44,928 --> 01:02:48,386
- It goes on and on.
- She knew things. Private things.

735
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,285
Now, how could
she have known all that?

736
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:53,391
A lot of times they read the obits.

737
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:56,686
All she had to do
was see the word "banker." Boom.

738
01:02:57,148 --> 01:03:01,437
Hell, they even go through your garbage
to find things they can use.

739
01:03:01,653 --> 01:03:04,645
Letters, old papers,
it doesn't take much.

740
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:06,532
No.

741
01:03:08,827 --> 01:03:10,192
It was real.

742
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:16,494
She knew about a sweater I knitted.

743
01:03:18,295 --> 01:03:20,001
And songs we sang.

744
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:27,258
Our trip to montego bay.

745
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:32,221
I'm sorry. I know this is hard.

746
01:03:33,685 --> 01:03:35,346
People want so much to believe.

747
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:38,179
They're grieving. They're vulnerable,

748
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:43,225
and they will give anything
for one last moment.

749
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:47,025
Believe me,
these people know what they're doing.

750
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:52,367
And I know how you must feel,
but you know you can press charges.

751
01:03:57,125 --> 01:03:58,331
No.

752
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:02,869
Thank you.

753
01:04:17,729 --> 01:04:19,560
Oh, god, let this be it.

754
01:04:32,327 --> 01:04:33,692
Yes.

755
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:47,049
Hello?

756
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:48,168
- Eddie?
- Yeah.

757
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:49,362
- It's Carl bruner.
- What's up?

758
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:51,238
I'm fine. Yeah, everything's fine.
Just, we're all set.

759
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:52,262
Good.

760
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:53,865
Just let me know
what you want me to do.

761
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:57,382
Okay, I want you to transfer the money
from the 12 separate accounts

762
01:04:57,477 --> 01:05:00,719
into a single account
under the name Rita Miller.

763
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:01,849
Okay.

764
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:05,057
Tomorrow at five minutes
before closing, 3:55 P.M.,

765
01:05:05,527 --> 01:05:09,065
transfer the full account
to the first island bank of Nassau,

766
01:05:09,531 --> 01:05:13,274
registry number 4869580.

767
01:05:13,368 --> 01:05:16,451
- Call us when it's done.
- Okay, I've got it.

768
01:05:18,123 --> 01:05:21,741
Just tell Mr. balistreri that there
won't be any more problems, okay?

769
01:05:21,835 --> 01:05:23,166
- Yeah, I'll do that.
- Thank you.

770
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:24,618
Good work, Carl.

771
01:06:24,564 --> 01:06:26,475
Molly, why can't you hear me?

772
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:28,731
I need you.

773
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:43,283
- Who is it?
- It's Carl, Molly.

774
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:46,579
No. Don't open it, Molly.
Don't open the goddamn door.

775
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:47,669
He's a murderer.

776
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:48,712
- Hi.
- Hey.

777
01:06:48,796 --> 01:06:51,879
Listen, sorry, I know it's late.
I'm sorry to disturb you.

778
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:54,757
I just...
I've been thinking about you all day.

779
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:58,928
And I feel really lousy about...
About what happened last night.

780
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:00,618
This supernatural thing just really...

781
01:07:00,642 --> 01:07:03,133
Listen, don't worry about it.
Really, it's okay.

782
01:07:03,228 --> 01:07:06,220
No, it's not.
You needed me to hear you and I didn't.

783
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:10,564
I wasn't there for you, and that was...
That was wrong.

784
01:07:11,903 --> 01:07:15,236
It's just I... I just...

785
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:19,199
I want you to know
that I'm your friend, mol.

786
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:22,618
- Thanks, Carl.
- You were never our friend.

787
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:25,162
- That really means a lot to me.
- Me, too.

788
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:27,662
So I brought you
some Japanese apple-pears.

789
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:29,242
I know you like them.

790
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:33,879
Thanks. That's very sweet.

791
01:07:33,967 --> 01:07:37,175
Could I come in for a second?
I won't stay long.

792
01:07:37,262 --> 01:07:38,405
It's just been one of those days.

793
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:40,511
Maybe a cup of coffee or something?
Yeah.

794
01:07:40,598 --> 01:07:42,429
- Come on in.
- No, Molly.

795
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:47,011
- You seem a little tense. Are you okay?
- No, I'm fine.

796
01:07:47,105 --> 01:07:50,347
It's just, god, what can I tell you?
It's been tough.

797
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:52,272
It's... I mean, you know,

798
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:54,312
it just still hurts so much.

799
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:55,940
You lying snake.

800
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:59,439
And then on top of it, it's stuff at work.

801
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:02,492
They've given me my own accounts,
which is good.

802
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:05,195
But I just haven't really had time
to adjust,

803
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,452
kind of absorb everything.

804
01:08:12,297 --> 01:08:13,628
It's no big deal.

805
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:24,766
Yeah.

806
01:08:26,311 --> 01:08:28,802
Can I have just a little more cream?
Yeah.

807
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:34,603
Oh, shit. Jesus. I can't
believe I did that.

808
01:08:34,694 --> 01:08:36,855
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

809
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:39,569
Oh, god.

810
01:08:39,657 --> 01:08:42,386
- Here, let me throw that in the washer.
- No, don't worry about it. It's okay.

811
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:43,525
It's just...

812
01:08:43,995 --> 01:08:46,862
- You want me to get you another shirt?
- No, it's fine. It'll dry.

813
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:49,572
- Just take a minute.
- Here you go.

814
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:56,537
So where were you today?
I thought you were gonna

815
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:58,919
come into the bank
and sign those papers.

816
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:02,252
Well, I was supposed to,
but I didn't have time.

817
01:09:03,181 --> 01:09:04,671
I went to the police.

818
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:15,682
You did? Wow, what did you tell them?
What did they say?

819
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:17,441
It was awful.

820
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:20,402
I felt really stupid.

821
01:09:22,033 --> 01:09:26,151
They brought out a file on this woman,
and... at least 10 inches thick.

822
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:30,614
- A rip-off artist, huh?
- No, Molly.

823
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:37,128
You know, the sad thing
is that I believed her.

824
01:09:38,216 --> 01:09:42,630
Molly, sometimes we need to believe.

825
01:09:44,722 --> 01:09:46,258
Why? What's the point?

826
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:49,341
Molly, it is not easy
to face the realities of life.

827
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:51,926
Sometimes you've gotta
give yourself that.

828
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:55,146
What you've got to remember is
the love that you guys felt.

829
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:56,313
I mean, that's what's real.

830
01:09:56,401 --> 01:09:58,107
You've got to remember
how good Sam was,

831
01:09:58,194 --> 01:09:59,730
how much he loved you.

832
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:03,405
You were everything to him, Molly.
You were his life.

833
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:19,412
I feel so alone.

834
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:30,306
You're not alone, okay?

835
01:10:31,769 --> 01:10:35,261
You've got your work.
You're incredibly talented. You're young.

836
01:10:35,523 --> 01:10:37,605
You're fantastically gorgeous.

837
01:10:39,736 --> 01:10:41,818
I don't know what's real anymore.

838
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:44,816
I don't know what to think.

839
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:50,325
Just think about Sam.

840
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:55,740
Think about the time
you guys had together,

841
01:10:56,836 --> 01:10:59,043
how wonderful that was.

842
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:01,207
Yeah.

843
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:04,624
Let your feelings out, Molly. It's okay.

844
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:07,502
Life turns on a dime.

845
01:11:09,474 --> 01:11:10,680
You know?

846
01:11:17,565 --> 01:11:20,477
That there's always gonna be tomorrow,
but that's bullshit.

847
01:11:20,568 --> 01:11:22,308
Sam taught us that.

848
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:25,649
You have to live for now,

849
01:11:28,993 --> 01:11:30,949
for today.

850
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:53,176
- I can't. I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

851
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:56,134
- I can't. It's just too soon.
- It's okay.

852
01:11:56,854 --> 01:11:59,095
You've been great, Carl.

853
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:05,147
- But I need you to leave.
- It's okay. I understand, totally.

854
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:06,564
Please.

855
01:12:12,829 --> 01:12:15,616
Could we just have dinner
tomorrow night? Just talk.

856
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:17,537
Can I interest you in that?

857
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,167
- Yeah, sure.
- Great.

858
01:13:30,698 --> 01:13:31,698
Hey.

859
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:38,953
- Get off my train.
- No.

860
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:42,282
Get off! Get off!

861
01:13:42,376 --> 01:13:45,209
Get off! Get off! Get off!

862
01:13:45,296 --> 01:13:49,005
- Get out of here. Get off.
- No.

863
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:51,086
Show me how you do that.

864
01:13:51,177 --> 01:13:53,071
I want to learn,
and I'm not leaving till you teach me.

865
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:55,632
- Get off!
- No.

866
01:13:55,723 --> 01:13:57,338
Get off!

867
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:06,480
You stubborn asshole.

868
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:11,940
What are you doing?
What the hell are you doing?

869
01:14:12,031 --> 01:14:13,567
What do you mean, what am I...

870
01:14:13,658 --> 01:14:15,614
You're trying to move it with your finger.

871
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:18,443
You can't push it with your finger.
You're dead.

872
01:14:26,754 --> 01:14:28,335
It's all in your mind.

873
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:32,082
The problem with you
is you still think you're real.

874
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:34,087
You think you're wearing those clothes?

875
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:37,670
You think you're crouched
on that floor? Bullshit!

876
01:14:37,848 --> 01:14:41,340
You ain't got a body no more, son.
It's all up here now.

877
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:44,598
If you want to move something,
you've got to move it with your mind.

878
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:47,101
You gotta focus.
You hear what I'm saying?

879
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:48,977
How? How do you focus?

880
01:14:49,068 --> 01:14:51,229
I don't know how you focus.

881
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:52,856
You just focus.

882
01:14:57,201 --> 01:15:00,034
- How did you do that?
- You gotta take all your emotions,

883
01:15:00,121 --> 01:15:02,407
all your anger,
all your love, all your hate,

884
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:06,082
and push it way down here
into the pit of your stomach.

885
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:08,534
And then let it explode like a reactor.

886
01:15:11,674 --> 01:15:13,380
Okay, okay.

887
01:15:18,556 --> 01:15:20,046
Don't laugh!

888
01:15:44,457 --> 01:15:45,617
Way to go, kid!

889
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:48,537
I did it.

890
01:15:49,462 --> 01:15:52,374
- I did it.
- Way to go.

891
01:15:59,764 --> 01:16:02,096
From your gut, like I told you.

892
01:16:05,102 --> 01:16:07,764
Give it time. What else have you got?

893
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:18,361
How long have you been here?

894
01:16:20,618 --> 01:16:22,154
Since they pushed me.

895
01:16:22,953 --> 01:16:25,786
- Someone pushed you?
- Yes, someone pushed me.

896
01:16:26,123 --> 01:16:28,614
- Who?
- What, you don't believe me?

897
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:31,325
You think I fell? You think I jumped?

898
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:33,160
Well, fuck you!

899
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:34,745
It wasn't my time.

900
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:38,549
I wasn't supposed to go!
I'm not supposed to be here!

901
01:16:48,312 --> 01:16:51,429
Oh, I'd give anything for a drag.

902
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:54,732
Just one drag!

903
01:16:55,319 --> 01:16:56,809
Are you all right?

904
01:16:57,113 --> 01:17:00,025
Who are you?
Why are you hounding me?

905
01:17:00,241 --> 01:17:01,731
Who sent you?

906
01:17:03,577 --> 01:17:05,693
Who sent you?

907
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:12,751
Leave me alone! Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!

908
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:57,127
Yes!

909
01:18:12,813 --> 01:18:14,269
So you need to concentrate,

910
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:16,376
'cause if you concentrate,
you'll probably rouse him.

911
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:18,937
- Now what's his name again?
- Orlando.

912
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:20,063
Orlando.

913
01:18:20,154 --> 01:18:23,817
Orlando, Orlando,
is there an Orlando here?

914
01:18:23,908 --> 01:18:25,398
- I'm here.
- He's here.

915
01:18:25,492 --> 01:18:27,323
- Oda Mae, I...
- Sam!

916
01:18:27,411 --> 01:18:29,072
- What the hell?
- Excuse me, I'm Orlando.

917
01:18:29,163 --> 01:18:30,653
The line's over there.

918
01:18:30,748 --> 01:18:32,659
Oda Mae, where did
all these ghosts come from?

919
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:35,492
- You can hear them, too?
- Hear them? Can I hear them?

920
01:18:35,586 --> 01:18:37,793
I hear them in the morning.
I hear them in the evening.

921
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:39,165
They're coming into the shower.

922
01:18:39,256 --> 01:18:40,696
Sam, what the hell did you do to me?

923
01:18:40,758 --> 01:18:42,819
Did you tell every spook in the world
you met about me?

924
01:18:42,843 --> 01:18:44,029
I got spooks from Jersey
coming in here.

925
01:18:44,053 --> 01:18:45,053
Jesus.

926
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:46,781
There's stuff going on
you wouldn't believe.

927
01:18:46,805 --> 01:18:48,090
I don't even believe it.

928
01:18:48,182 --> 01:18:50,160
- It's amazing. You're really doing it.
- Yes, I know.

929
01:18:50,184 --> 01:18:51,219
How do you like that?

930
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:55,474
- Can you two please hurry this up?
- Oh, chill out. Chill out!

931
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:56,917
Listen, I need your help again,
oda Mae.

932
01:18:56,941 --> 01:18:58,460
- There's something we need to do.
- No.

933
01:18:58,484 --> 01:19:00,349
I'm not doing anything else
with you, Sam.

934
01:19:00,444 --> 01:19:04,028
Look, you're holding onto a life
that doesn't want you anymore.

935
01:19:04,114 --> 01:19:06,856
It doesn't want you. Give up the ghost.

936
01:19:06,951 --> 01:19:08,816
Are you speaking to me?

937
01:19:08,911 --> 01:19:10,651
Does it look like I'm speaking to you?

938
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:12,202
You'll know when I'm talking to you.

939
01:19:12,289 --> 01:19:14,075
You supposed to be concentrating,
aren't you?

940
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:16,623
Now, you want to try it?
Thank you very much.

941
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:17,896
Now, Sam,
are you gonna get out of here?

942
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,002
'Cause I got work to do.

943
01:19:20,089 --> 01:19:21,579
Fine, then stay there.

944
01:19:21,674 --> 01:19:24,507
Excuse me. Excuse me.
You ready now?

945
01:19:25,636 --> 01:19:26,967
Let's do it.

946
01:19:27,054 --> 01:19:30,296
Oda Mae, listen.
I got to talk to you now. I've got a plan.

947
01:19:30,391 --> 01:19:31,618
You see, I figured this thing out.

948
01:19:31,642 --> 01:19:34,509
There's something we can do.
All we gotto do is...

949
01:19:34,645 --> 01:19:35,885
Oda Mae?

950
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:43,896
Oda Mae?

951
01:19:46,156 --> 01:19:47,817
Ortisha?

952
01:19:49,118 --> 01:19:51,029
Orlando? Is that you?

953
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,736
Ortisha, where are you at?
I can't hardly see.

954
01:19:53,831 --> 01:19:57,995
- Here. She's here.
- In front of you. I'm right here.

955
01:20:02,339 --> 01:20:05,251
Damn, baby!
What'd you do to your hair?

956
01:20:07,094 --> 01:20:10,461
Orlando, you like it?
It's Autumn sunrise.

957
01:20:14,518 --> 01:20:16,804
Get out of me, you son of a bitch!

958
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:22,727
Don't you ever do that to me again.

959
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:24,058
Orlando!

960
01:20:26,697 --> 01:20:29,097
- I can barely move.
- Now, you should know better than that.

961
01:20:30,117 --> 01:20:32,449
Jumping into bodies wipes you out.

962
01:20:32,536 --> 01:20:33,616
Everybody out!

963
01:20:33,704 --> 01:20:35,444
What happened to Orlando?

964
01:20:35,539 --> 01:20:37,450
Where's the insurance policy?

965
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:41,409
Are you deaf? I said everybody out!

966
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:43,915
Everybody out! Get out, get out, get out!

967
01:20:44,006 --> 01:20:45,962
Everybody get out!

968
01:20:57,895 --> 01:20:59,305
Get out!

969
01:20:59,438 --> 01:21:01,975
- You the fortuneteller?
- Who are you?

970
01:21:02,316 --> 01:21:04,602
That's an interesting question.

971
01:21:05,277 --> 01:21:06,392
Why don't you tell me?

972
01:21:06,487 --> 01:21:08,398
Willie. Willie?

973
01:21:09,448 --> 01:21:10,938
Prospect place Willie?

974
01:21:11,158 --> 01:21:12,989
Get out of here! Fast!

975
01:21:25,089 --> 01:21:27,831
- Sister! Sister!
- Oda Mae!

976
01:21:28,926 --> 01:21:30,837
I'm all right. I'm all right.

977
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:35,637
Oda Mae, we're in trouble,
so you've got to help me.

978
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:38,716
What do you mean we? Who's we?
You're already dead.

979
01:21:38,811 --> 01:21:40,955
Don't you understand?
These people are trying to kill me.

980
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:43,345
Yeah, you're right. And they'll be back.

981
01:21:44,108 --> 01:21:46,169
Look, why don't you just find a house
to haunt, you know?

982
01:21:46,193 --> 01:21:48,104
Get some chains and rattle them
or something.

983
01:21:48,195 --> 01:21:50,686
Will you listen to me?
I have a plan and it will work.

984
01:21:50,781 --> 01:21:52,737
But you've gotta get
some of your fake ids.

985
01:21:52,825 --> 01:21:54,031
Forget it.

986
01:21:54,118 --> 01:21:57,326
If you do this, they'll never
bother you again, I promise.

987
01:22:02,292 --> 01:22:03,748
Scouts' honor.

988
01:22:05,129 --> 01:22:06,244
All right.

989
01:22:07,589 --> 01:22:10,456
What do I have to do?
What exactly do I have to do?

990
01:22:12,302 --> 01:22:13,508
You got a nice dress?

991
01:22:17,141 --> 01:22:19,052
I don't see what's wrong
with what I'm wearing.

992
01:22:19,143 --> 01:22:20,823
I'm sorry I made a joke.
I love your shoes.

993
01:22:20,894 --> 01:22:23,601
No, I don't think you do.
You know, I think I'm gonna go home.

994
01:22:23,689 --> 01:22:25,750
I'm going home because
I don't know anything about banking.

995
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:26,918
I don't know that this is gonna work.

996
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:28,711
- Oda Mae, would you just relax?
- Listen, I'm nervous.

997
01:22:28,735 --> 01:22:29,735
Please donate.

998
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:32,106
I know you're nervous,
but I will get you through it.

999
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:35,781
- And the fake driver's license is great.
- Oh, Sam, I don't think I can do this.

1000
01:22:35,868 --> 01:22:39,235
You can do it. Straight ahead of you.
A stairway that says, "new accounts."

1001
01:22:39,329 --> 01:22:41,474
- That's where we're going.
- I'm not giving them no money.

1002
01:22:41,498 --> 01:22:43,739
- Just do what I say and don't talk.
- Okay.

1003
01:22:46,879 --> 01:22:49,441
Tell her you're here to fill out
a signature card for a new account.

1004
01:22:49,465 --> 01:22:50,465
Can I help you?

1005
01:22:50,549 --> 01:22:54,588
Yes, I'm here to fill out
a signature card for a new account.

1006
01:22:54,678 --> 01:22:56,384
And do you know your account number?

1007
01:22:56,472 --> 01:22:58,929
092631043.

1008
01:22:59,016 --> 01:23:00,802
926... 31043.

1009
01:23:00,893 --> 01:23:02,474
31043.

1010
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:05,727
Rita Miller. “Who?

1011
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:07,179
- What?
- Tell her Rita Miller.

1012
01:23:07,274 --> 01:23:08,274
Rita Miller.

1013
01:23:08,358 --> 01:23:10,940
Didn't they have you sign a card
when you opened the account?

1014
01:23:11,028 --> 01:23:12,797
Tell her Carl bruner opened it for you
by phone

1015
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:13,882
and asked you to come in today.

1016
01:23:13,906 --> 01:23:17,069
You see, Carl bruner,
he opened it for me by phone,

1017
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:19,571
that account, and now he's asked me
to come in today.

1018
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:20,661
I see.

1019
01:23:22,039 --> 01:23:24,655
Is that right? Yeah.

1020
01:23:25,751 --> 01:23:26,866
All right.

1021
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:30,794
Just sign this card
on the bottom line, please.

1022
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:33,543
May I use your pen?
Thank you so much.

1023
01:23:39,389 --> 01:23:41,175
No, no, no! Rita Miller.

1024
01:23:42,142 --> 01:23:43,678
I'm so sorry.

1025
01:23:44,186 --> 01:23:48,179
You know, I... I need another one.
I signed the wrong name.

1026
01:23:54,571 --> 01:23:57,404
Now, tell her to make sure it goes
straight up to the third floor file,

1027
01:23:57,491 --> 01:23:58,885
because you have
a transaction to make.

1028
01:23:58,909 --> 01:24:01,269
Please make sure this goes right up
to the third floor file,

1029
01:24:01,328 --> 01:24:03,068
because I have a transfusion to make.

1030
01:24:03,163 --> 01:24:05,905
- A what?
- Let's go.

1031
01:24:06,416 --> 01:24:09,249
You know what I mean.
Can I keep this pen?

1032
01:24:10,921 --> 01:24:14,038
- Yes, sure.
- Thank you so much.

1033
01:24:15,092 --> 01:24:16,207
Bye-bye.

1034
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:18,633
- I just love these pens.
- Then keep the pen.

1035
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:21,600
- Why are you always making me...
- What do you want to keep the pen for?

1036
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:25,557
- Carl bruner speaking.
- Hi, Carl.

1037
01:24:25,644 --> 01:24:28,135
- Mr. balistreri.
- Balistreri?

1038
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:31,438
- Carl, it's me, John.
- John, John. Sorry.

1039
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:34,357
What... what... what's up?

1040
01:24:34,444 --> 01:24:36,605
I've got the info on the Bradley portfolio.

1041
01:24:36,697 --> 01:24:39,905
Oh, right, okay, look, I'll just...
I'll pick it up later. All right?

1042
01:24:39,992 --> 01:24:42,449
- All right. I'll be here till 6:00.
- Good.

1043
01:24:47,541 --> 01:24:48,826
This is it.

1044
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:51,124
I don't suppose I can talk you
into losing the hat.

1045
01:24:51,211 --> 01:24:54,169
You keep messing with me,
you'll be here by yourself.

1046
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:57,706
Tell the guard you're here
to see Lyle Ferguson.

1047
01:24:57,801 --> 01:24:59,086
Lyle Ferguson.

1048
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:02,711
Hi. I'm here to see
Lyle Ferguson, please.

1049
01:25:02,806 --> 01:25:05,388
- Do you have an appointment?
- No, I'm here for my health.

1050
01:25:05,475 --> 01:25:07,261
Don't say that.
Tell him Rita Miller's here.

1051
01:25:07,352 --> 01:25:09,593
You just tell him Rita Miller's here.

1052
01:25:09,688 --> 01:25:11,394
Just one moment, please.

1053
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:12,808
Don't embellish.

1054
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:15,975
Excuse me?

1055
01:25:19,489 --> 01:25:22,481
Now, listen.
This guy Ferguson's a real jerk.

1056
01:25:22,576 --> 01:25:25,613
I've known him for five years,
and he still thinks my name's...

1057
01:25:25,704 --> 01:25:29,868
- Why are you whispering?
- Just be quiet and listen.

1058
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:32,745
He's a social moron, so you don't have
anything to worry about.

1059
01:25:32,836 --> 01:25:34,747
Just tell the guard Ferguson knows you.

1060
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:37,013
You spent time with him
and his wife, Shirley,

1061
01:25:37,090 --> 01:25:40,002
at the Brewster's Christmas party
last year. Got it?

1062
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:43,093
What is this in regards to?
“What?

1063
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:44,340
He doesn't remember me?

1064
01:25:44,431 --> 01:25:47,639
Oh, we spent all that time at the
Brewster's Christmas party last year.

1065
01:25:47,726 --> 01:25:50,763
He and his lovely wife, Shirley.
It was beautiful.

1066
01:25:50,854 --> 01:25:54,722
A big old tree and thousands
of presents everywhere. It...

1067
01:25:57,027 --> 01:25:58,312
Gas.

1068
01:25:59,696 --> 01:26:03,109
I get a little gas from time to time.
That's all. Gas.

1069
01:26:05,035 --> 01:26:08,072
- Quit poking me!
- Well, don't overdo it.

1070
01:26:09,206 --> 01:26:10,350
Now, listen, this'll be easy.

1071
01:26:10,374 --> 01:26:11,910
Ferguson was so drunk at that party,

1072
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,840
he could've had a conversation
with Tina Turner

1073
01:26:13,919 --> 01:26:15,659
and he wouldn't remember.

1074
01:26:19,549 --> 01:26:22,712
- I don't know, Sam.
- Here we go.

1075
01:26:26,306 --> 01:26:28,638
Hello. Hello. Yes.

1076
01:26:30,769 --> 01:26:34,227
Of course, yes.
Well, it's been a long time.

1077
01:26:34,314 --> 01:26:35,724
Oh, a long time.

1078
01:26:35,816 --> 01:26:37,216
Ask how Bobby and snooky are doing.

1079
01:26:37,275 --> 01:26:39,766
By the way,
how are Bobby and snooky doing?

1080
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:42,568
Fine. Fine. Thank you.

1081
01:26:42,948 --> 01:26:44,484
Thank you for asking.

1082
01:26:44,908 --> 01:26:48,901
And how is your family?

1083
01:26:48,995 --> 01:26:50,610
Oh, couldn't be better.

1084
01:26:51,248 --> 01:26:53,284
Well, wonderful.

1085
01:26:54,292 --> 01:26:57,250
Tell him you've been wondering
how they did on the Gibraltar securities.

1086
01:26:57,337 --> 01:27:01,330
I was just wondering, how did you do
on the Gibraltar securities?

1087
01:27:01,717 --> 01:27:04,174
The Gibraltar securities?

1088
01:27:04,261 --> 01:27:07,344
Well, it looks like we topped out
on that one, huh?

1089
01:27:07,431 --> 01:27:09,296
We sure did. We sure did.

1090
01:27:09,391 --> 01:27:11,598
- That was a very useful tip.
- Good old Randy.

1091
01:27:11,685 --> 01:27:13,550
- Good old Randy.
- Right.

1092
01:27:13,645 --> 01:27:15,181
Got a good old head on his shoulders.

1093
01:27:15,272 --> 01:27:16,499
- Her shoulders.
- Her shoulders.

1094
01:27:16,523 --> 01:27:19,014
- Her shoulders.
- Randy.

1095
01:27:19,109 --> 01:27:23,227
Yeah. So, what...
What brings you here today?

1096
01:27:23,655 --> 01:27:26,488
- You're closing an account.
- I'm closing an account.

1097
01:27:26,575 --> 01:27:29,032
Well, wonderful.
Do you have your account number?

1098
01:27:29,119 --> 01:27:30,154
Yes”? Yes.

1099
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:32,327
Yes. 02631043.

1100
01:27:32,414 --> 01:27:36,032
092631043.

1101
01:27:36,126 --> 01:27:37,161
Is that right? Yeah.

1102
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:38,412
Good.

1103
01:27:46,636 --> 01:27:50,128
Well, Rita, it looks like
you'll be withdrawing

1104
01:27:50,223 --> 01:27:52,259
$4 million from us today.

1105
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:55,137
- $4 million?
- Say yes. Say yes!

1106
01:27:55,645 --> 01:27:57,806
Is that correct? Yes.

1107
01:27:57,898 --> 01:28:00,765
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yes.

1108
01:28:01,526 --> 01:28:03,642
- That's correct. Yes.
- Easy, easy.

1109
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:05,895
Yes.

1110
01:28:06,865 --> 01:28:08,821
Well, how would you like that?

1111
01:28:09,659 --> 01:28:11,615
- Tens and twenties.
- Pardon?

1112
01:28:11,703 --> 01:28:13,568
Cashier's check.
Tell him a cashier's check.

1113
01:28:13,663 --> 01:28:15,244
I think better, a cashier's check.

1114
01:28:15,332 --> 01:28:18,039
A cashier's check. Fine.

1115
01:28:18,168 --> 01:28:23,128
Well, of course, you know,
we require identification from everyone.

1116
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:24,705
- It's just procedural.
- Oh, ID! Yes.

1117
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,210
You know, I...

1118
01:28:36,853 --> 01:28:40,437
Thank you. Well, I'll be right back.

1119
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:43,515
$4 million!

1120
01:28:50,242 --> 01:28:53,860
Yeah, get me the first island bank
of Nassau. It's on the rolodex.

1121
01:29:03,964 --> 01:29:07,673
Well, we have some things for you
to sign here.

1122
01:29:07,759 --> 01:29:10,216
This officially closes the account.

1123
01:29:11,263 --> 01:29:13,299
And here you are.

1124
01:29:13,390 --> 01:29:15,472
Now, sign Rita Miller.

1125
01:29:17,644 --> 01:29:20,431
Rita Miller. That's my name.

1126
01:29:20,897 --> 01:29:23,980
My name. Rita Miller. My name.

1127
01:29:24,943 --> 01:29:26,058
My name.

1128
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:28,880
- Molly, hi. It's good to see you.
- Hi.

1129
01:29:28,947 --> 01:29:32,155
- Oda Mae, I'll be right back.
- A few more if you would, please.

1130
01:29:32,242 --> 01:29:33,652
Just anywhere?

1131
01:29:33,743 --> 01:29:35,108
Right here.

1132
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:42,035
Fine.

1133
01:29:42,252 --> 01:29:44,243
The check.

1134
01:29:45,672 --> 01:29:48,755
This... here you are.

1135
01:29:49,301 --> 01:29:51,112
The person you need to see
is right down at the end.

1136
01:29:51,136 --> 01:29:52,421
Okay, thanks.

1137
01:29:57,559 --> 01:30:00,426
Mama took the money
that she made in the oil Wells,

1138
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:02,511
and she sunk it into gas pumps.

1139
01:30:02,606 --> 01:30:04,346
You know,
how they have at the gas station?

1140
01:30:04,441 --> 01:30:06,682
And those gas stations
have five or six of those things,

1141
01:30:06,776 --> 01:30:08,437
so it's very, very lucrative.

1142
01:30:08,528 --> 01:30:10,314
- Oda Mae.
- It really adds up.

1143
01:30:10,405 --> 01:30:12,466
- Oda Mae, we've gotta go. Say goodbye.
- Well, gotta go now.

1144
01:30:12,490 --> 01:30:15,448
It's been a pleasure doing business
with you, a real pleasure.

1145
01:30:15,535 --> 01:30:17,116
Now, may I keep the pen?

1146
01:30:17,203 --> 01:30:18,909
Say good night to Bobby
and snooky for me.

1147
01:30:18,997 --> 01:30:20,988
I'll see you. Bye-bye.

1148
01:30:21,458 --> 01:30:23,414
Why are you rushing me?

1149
01:30:27,881 --> 01:30:29,667
What is wrong?

1150
01:30:39,559 --> 01:30:41,925
- Excuse me. Lyle?
- Oh, yes...

1151
01:30:42,312 --> 01:30:43,893
- Molly Jensen.
- Molly.

1152
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:46,642
The woman you were
just doing business with.

1153
01:30:46,733 --> 01:30:48,394
Yeah? What did she want?

1154
01:30:48,485 --> 01:30:51,568
I mean, did it have anything
to do with me or with Sam?

1155
01:30:51,655 --> 01:30:53,816
Sam? Why, no. No.

1156
01:30:54,616 --> 01:30:58,359
- That was oda Mae brown, right?
- No, her name was Rita Miller,

1157
01:30:58,453 --> 01:31:00,614
and she was closing an account.

1158
01:31:00,747 --> 01:31:05,332
- Why? Is there a problem?
- No. I guess not.

1159
01:31:05,669 --> 01:31:06,954
Thank you.

1160
01:31:36,449 --> 01:31:38,690
Carl, is something wrong?

1161
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:41,158
Is somebody playing
with the computers?

1162
01:31:41,246 --> 01:31:43,862
- What?
- One of my accounts is closed.

1163
01:31:43,957 --> 01:31:48,041
Which account? What's wrong?
You want me to call someone?

1164
01:31:48,670 --> 01:31:51,878
No, it's okay. I can do it. I got it.

1165
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:56,795
$4 million!

1166
01:31:56,886 --> 01:31:58,842
Oh, my god,
what am I gonna do with this money?

1167
01:31:58,930 --> 01:32:00,570
L... you know,
I'm gonna buy the building.

1168
01:32:00,598 --> 01:32:02,338
No, no, wait. I'm gonna buy the block.

1169
01:32:02,434 --> 01:32:04,074
I'm gonna make my sister
go to a fat farm,

1170
01:32:04,144 --> 01:32:05,454
because, you know, she's way too big.

1171
01:32:05,478 --> 01:32:06,706
Whoa, wait! What are you gonna do...

1172
01:32:06,730 --> 01:32:08,374
Then I'm gonna...
Yeah, I'm gonna buy the building.

1173
01:32:08,398 --> 01:32:10,605
Wait, wait, wait, oda Mae,
I've got an idea.

1174
01:32:10,692 --> 01:32:13,412
- Take the check out of your purse.
- Oh, you're right. You're right.

1175
01:32:13,486 --> 01:32:15,977
I should take it out.
I should put it where nobody can get it.

1176
01:32:16,072 --> 01:32:18,279
No, no, no. Endorse it.

1177
01:32:19,242 --> 01:32:22,325
No, if I endorse it, then if I drop it,
somebody will get it. No, I'll just...

1178
01:32:22,412 --> 01:32:24,027
It's not your money.

1179
01:32:24,122 --> 01:32:26,579
I never said
you were gonna get the money.

1180
01:32:26,875 --> 01:32:28,991
This is blood money.
I was killed for this money.

1181
01:32:29,085 --> 01:32:31,872
- Now, endorse the check.
- I know, but...

1182
01:32:31,963 --> 01:32:34,375
Well, Sam,
what are you gonna do with it?

1183
01:32:34,924 --> 01:32:38,087
Look over there, to your left.

1184
01:32:42,223 --> 01:32:45,841
I know you don't think I'm giving this
$4 million to a bunch of nuns!

1185
01:32:45,935 --> 01:32:48,267
Oda Mae, if you don't do it,
they will track you down.

1186
01:32:48,354 --> 01:32:50,720
Your only protection is to get rid of it.

1187
01:32:50,815 --> 01:32:53,727
Oh, Sam, come on. You're killing me!
It's $4 million!

1188
01:32:53,818 --> 01:32:56,104
Just think of it this way,
you'll go to heaven.

1189
01:32:56,196 --> 01:32:57,356
I don't want to go to heaven!

1190
01:32:57,447 --> 01:33:00,280
I want to go to a bank
and cash the goddamn check!

1191
01:33:03,578 --> 01:33:05,114
Hello. Yeah.

1192
01:33:05,205 --> 01:33:07,696
- You'll thank me later.
- How are you doing?

1193
01:33:09,459 --> 01:33:11,745
- Now, endorse it Rita Miller.
- I know.

1194
01:33:12,670 --> 01:33:15,082
Make it out to St. Joseph's shelter.

1195
01:33:15,632 --> 01:33:18,123
I can't believe you're making me do this.

1196
01:33:23,306 --> 01:33:24,341
Now, give it to her.

1197
01:33:24,432 --> 01:33:27,411
I will, 1 will. 1 just want to feel it
one more time in my fingers, that's all.

1198
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:29,721
- Just give the lady the check.
- I will!

1199
01:33:32,816 --> 01:33:34,977
Hand her the check. You can do it.

1200
01:33:37,487 --> 01:33:40,524
- Give her the check.
- I will.

1201
01:33:43,618 --> 01:33:46,530
Bless you, child. Bless you.

1202
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:57,045
Give it to her. Let go. Let go!

1203
01:33:58,466 --> 01:34:00,002
Shit.

1204
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:05,511
I'm proud of you, oda Mae.

1205
01:34:05,598 --> 01:34:07,660
You know something, Sam?
I don't care if you're proud of me.

1206
01:34:07,684 --> 01:34:10,329
You stay away from me from now on.
What is that nun going to do with it?

1207
01:34:10,353 --> 01:34:12,832
She can't even buy underwear. Nothing.
I hate you. Leave me alone.

1208
01:34:12,856 --> 01:34:14,517
Never talk to me again.

1209
01:34:15,191 --> 01:34:17,398
I think you're wonderful, oda Mae.

1210
01:34:53,396 --> 01:34:55,728
Go ahead, search. You'll never find it.

1211
01:34:57,859 --> 01:34:59,815
They're gonna kill you, Carl.

1212
01:34:59,903 --> 01:35:03,020
You and Willie,
you're gonna be fertilizer.

1213
01:35:03,740 --> 01:35:06,573
They're gonna bury you
right next to Jimmy hoffa.

1214
01:35:50,912 --> 01:35:52,322
Who's doing that?

1215
01:35:53,289 --> 01:35:54,950
Who's doing that?

1216
01:36:10,932 --> 01:36:12,047
- Hey.
- Hi.

1217
01:36:12,141 --> 01:36:14,052
Where were you?
I thought we were having dinner.

1218
01:36:14,143 --> 01:36:17,852
I know, mol. I'm sorry.
Things got a little crazy. I just forgot.

1219
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:19,499
Yeah, had a little trouble at the bank.

1220
01:36:19,565 --> 01:36:20,600
You forgot? Yeah.

1221
01:36:20,692 --> 01:36:21,961
You know, I wish you would have
called me,

1222
01:36:21,985 --> 01:36:23,646
because I've been really worried.

1223
01:36:24,988 --> 01:36:27,570
Listen to me, Molly,
I gotta ask you about something.

1224
01:36:27,657 --> 01:36:29,739
Yeah, he needs to borrow $4 million.

1225
01:36:29,826 --> 01:36:33,114
When you said that you thought
that Sam was here,

1226
01:36:33,204 --> 01:36:34,410
that he was talking to you,

1227
01:36:34,497 --> 01:36:36,738
what did you feel?
What did he say to you?

1228
01:36:36,833 --> 01:36:38,310
Why? What does that have
to do with anything?

1229
01:36:38,334 --> 01:36:40,666
It's just... listen to me for a second.

1230
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:42,982
This psychic lady,
I want to know what she told you.

1231
01:36:43,006 --> 01:36:46,840
- I wanna know exactly what she said.
- Carl, let me go. Carl, stop this.

1232
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:51,382
It doesn't matter. It wasn't real.

1233
01:36:52,932 --> 01:36:55,218
What the hell happened to you tonight?

1234
01:36:55,685 --> 01:36:59,143
Does this have anything to do
with her being at the bank today?

1235
01:37:02,317 --> 01:37:03,682
The bank?

1236
01:37:04,402 --> 01:37:07,235
Yeah, Ferguson said she closed
an account.

1237
01:37:07,822 --> 01:37:11,986
Her name isn't even oda Mae brown.
It's Rita Miller or something.

1238
01:37:16,122 --> 01:37:18,078
Carl, are you all right?

1239
01:37:20,585 --> 01:37:22,541
It's just my stomach...

1240
01:37:25,381 --> 01:37:26,381
Jesus.

1241
01:37:26,799 --> 01:37:30,132
Do you have any, like, I don't know,
some pepto-bismol or something?

1242
01:37:30,219 --> 01:37:32,084
- Cyanide.
- Yeah. It's upstairs.

1243
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:35,422
Why don't you sit down, and I'll get it?

1244
01:37:41,105 --> 01:37:44,222
What's wrong? Does little Carl
have a little tummy ache?

1245
01:37:46,319 --> 01:37:48,310
What are you doing to me?

1246
01:37:51,574 --> 01:37:53,781
Now do you believe in ghosts?

1247
01:37:57,705 --> 01:38:00,242
I'll set the place on fire, I swear to god.

1248
01:38:07,757 --> 01:38:10,464
- I'll cut her throat.
- Carl.

1249
01:38:11,761 --> 01:38:15,094
I swear to god. I'll cut her throat.

1250
01:38:18,267 --> 01:38:21,350
I need that money,
and I want it tonight at 11:00.

1251
01:38:21,813 --> 01:38:24,429
If that psychic lady
does not bring it here,

1252
01:38:24,524 --> 01:38:26,731
Molly is dead. Okay?

1253
01:38:27,735 --> 01:38:31,148
- Carl, who are you talking to?
- Nothing. Now, Molly, listen to me.

1254
01:38:31,239 --> 01:38:32,820
I have to go, okay?

1255
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:35,193
I can't explain this now,
but there is a problem, okay?

1256
01:38:35,284 --> 01:38:37,721
- Something's going on at the bank.
- Carl, you're really scaring me.

1257
01:38:37,745 --> 01:38:39,598
I'm sorry, mol.
Look, I don't have time to talk now,

1258
01:38:39,622 --> 01:38:40,862
but I'll come back about 11:00.

1259
01:38:40,957 --> 01:38:42,788
- Why? Why not now?
- Molly, I can't talk now.

1260
01:38:42,875 --> 01:38:46,208
Molly, look, I'll come back.
What do you say? Like, 11:00, okay?

1261
01:38:46,295 --> 01:38:47,705
I'm sorry to do this to you, Molly,

1262
01:38:47,797 --> 01:38:49,358
but it's really important.
I gotta go. Okay?

1263
01:38:49,382 --> 01:38:51,293
- 11:00.
- Oda Mae!

1264
01:38:54,971 --> 01:38:58,338
I'm arsenio hall.
Don't try to adjust your television.

1265
01:38:58,433 --> 01:38:59,468
I'm black.

1266
01:39:01,102 --> 01:39:04,219
- I want to watch love connection.
- I love love connection.

1267
01:39:04,313 --> 01:39:07,146
- I love that man on there.
- Leave that! That's arsenio.

1268
01:39:07,233 --> 01:39:08,894
S07 - what do you mean, so?

1269
01:39:08,985 --> 01:39:11,255
You love love connection,
you ought to send your picture in there.

1270
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:12,769
She did already.

1271
01:39:12,864 --> 01:39:14,650
They just haven't answered yet.

1272
01:39:14,740 --> 01:39:16,731
- Oda Mae?
- Sam?

1273
01:39:16,826 --> 01:39:18,720
- Oh, no. Not again.
- Oda Mae, we're in trouble.

1274
01:39:18,744 --> 01:39:20,180
They want the check,
and they're coming for you.

1275
01:39:20,204 --> 01:39:21,306
So you gotta get out of here.

1276
01:39:21,330 --> 01:39:22,724
What do you mean,
they want the check?

1277
01:39:22,748 --> 01:39:24,864
The check you said
they would never know about?

1278
01:39:24,959 --> 01:39:27,120
- Oda Mae, what's happening?
- Sam.

1279
01:39:27,211 --> 01:39:29,577
They're here! They're here!
Get out of here! Now! Go!

1280
01:39:29,672 --> 01:39:31,628
Come on. We gotta go!
“What's the matter?

1281
01:39:31,924 --> 01:39:33,289
Come on, come on!

1282
01:39:42,685 --> 01:39:44,516
Just knock on the door here.

1283
01:39:44,937 --> 01:39:47,178
Help! Help!

1284
01:39:47,273 --> 01:39:50,686
- It's an emergency. You gotta let us in.
- Who are you kidding?

1285
01:39:59,660 --> 01:40:00,866
Open up!

1286
01:40:01,621 --> 01:40:03,452
What are you doing?
You can't come in here.

1287
01:40:03,539 --> 01:40:06,781
The cat don't like visitors.
She'll pee all over that...

1288
01:40:15,843 --> 01:40:17,629
They're gonna get us.

1289
01:40:18,930 --> 01:40:20,045
Where's Sam?

1290
01:40:20,139 --> 01:40:23,723
- Shit! It looks like the bitch just left.
- I'll check downstairs.

1291
01:40:35,321 --> 01:40:36,401
Carl?

1292
01:40:54,632 --> 01:40:55,997
Shit!

1293
01:41:26,664 --> 01:41:27,699
Willie!

1294
01:41:36,799 --> 01:41:39,666
Hey, man,
you got a serious problem, man.

1295
01:42:01,866 --> 01:42:04,653
Help me! Help!

1296
01:43:01,217 --> 01:43:03,048
That dude 1s dead.

1297
01:43:08,766 --> 01:43:10,302
You're dead, Willie.

1298
01:43:31,622 --> 01:43:37,583
No! No! No!

1299
01:43:40,172 --> 01:43:42,083
Help me!

1300
01:44:04,447 --> 01:44:06,278
Tell the driver to hurry.

1301
01:44:07,116 --> 01:44:08,822
Yo, man, you wanna step on it, please?

1302
01:44:08,909 --> 01:44:11,525
Listen, lady, I'm driving as fast as I can.

1303
01:44:19,962 --> 01:44:21,122
Problems?

1304
01:44:29,013 --> 01:44:31,299
- Carl, is that you?
- No, it's me, oda Mae.

1305
01:44:31,390 --> 01:44:33,506
Listen. Molly,
I know what you think of me.

1306
01:44:33,601 --> 01:44:35,871
I know what you think of me,
but, look, you gotta talk to me.

1307
01:44:35,895 --> 01:44:37,760
You are in serious danger.

1308
01:44:38,147 --> 01:44:39,387
I got Sam here with me.

1309
01:44:42,651 --> 01:44:44,687
- I'm calling the police.
- Good.

1310
01:44:44,779 --> 01:44:47,099
- Tell her to do it.
- Fine. That's what we want you to do.

1311
01:44:47,156 --> 01:44:48,646
We want you to call the police.

1312
01:44:48,741 --> 01:44:50,606
- But you've gotta let us in.
- No.

1313
01:44:51,410 --> 01:44:52,741
Look, don't you get it?

1314
01:44:52,828 --> 01:44:55,820
Sam was not just accidentally killed.
He was murdered.

1315
01:44:55,915 --> 01:44:58,827
He found out that Carl
was laundering money at the bank.

1316
01:44:58,918 --> 01:45:02,035
Now, this guy Carl is dangerous.
I'm telling you, he tried to kill me.

1317
01:45:02,129 --> 01:45:03,994
He's gonna try to kill you, too.

1318
01:45:04,089 --> 01:45:06,546
You are in deep, deep trouble.

1319
01:45:06,675 --> 01:45:08,666
Why are you doing this to me?

1320
01:45:09,345 --> 01:45:11,210
Why are you doing this to me?

1321
01:45:11,388 --> 01:45:13,595
Do you hear me?
Why are you doing this to me?

1322
01:45:13,682 --> 01:45:17,266
I can't. I just... I just can't.

1323
01:45:17,353 --> 01:45:20,891
Oda Mae, oda Mae,
tell her she's wearing the shirt

1324
01:45:20,981 --> 01:45:23,017
that I spilled the Margarita on

1325
01:45:23,108 --> 01:45:25,565
and the earrings
I gave her for Christmas.

1326
01:45:26,362 --> 01:45:28,478
Molly, Sam says to tell you
you're wearing the shirt

1327
01:45:28,572 --> 01:45:30,187
that he spilled the Margarita on

1328
01:45:30,282 --> 01:45:32,898
and the earrings he gave you
for Christmas.

1329
01:45:39,333 --> 01:45:42,871
Don't you see?
I'm not a fake, not about this.

1330
01:45:48,092 --> 01:45:50,504
Give me a penny, quick. “What?

1331
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:52,175
Push a penny under the door, now.

1332
01:45:52,263 --> 01:45:54,241
What you be talking about,
push a penny under the door?

1333
01:45:54,265 --> 01:45:55,880
Just do it.

1334
01:46:33,429 --> 01:46:36,637
- Tell her it's for luck.
- Sam says it's for luck.

1335
01:47:13,010 --> 01:47:15,376
We're between Greene and Mercer
on prince.

1336
01:47:15,471 --> 01:47:18,634
It's the gray building right across
from the post office.

1337
01:47:18,807 --> 01:47:22,095
Thanks, sergeant. Please hurry.
We'll be waiting.

1338
01:47:23,187 --> 01:47:25,519
- All right. They're on their way.
- Good.

1339
01:47:27,983 --> 01:47:31,225
- So, what do we do now?
- Just wait.

1340
01:47:41,497 --> 01:47:42,987
Is Sam here?

1341
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:45,706
Sam?

1342
01:47:47,252 --> 01:47:48,867
I'm sitting beside her.

1343
01:47:50,756 --> 01:47:52,712
He's sitting right beside you.

1344
01:48:02,559 --> 01:48:04,220
Sam, can you feel me?

1345
01:48:06,313 --> 01:48:07,723
With all my heart.

1346
01:48:09,233 --> 01:48:11,189
He says with all his heart.

1347
01:48:23,706 --> 01:48:26,698
I'd give anything
if I could just touch you once more.

1348
01:48:31,046 --> 01:48:32,286
He says he wishes

1349
01:48:32,881 --> 01:48:35,213
he was alive again,
so he could touch you.

1350
01:48:37,970 --> 01:48:39,210
Me, too.

1351
01:48:56,321 --> 01:48:59,984
Okay. Okay, look. You can use me.

1352
01:49:01,577 --> 01:49:04,614
- Use you?
- You can use my body.

1353
01:49:04,705 --> 01:49:05,740
Use your body?

1354
01:49:05,831 --> 01:49:07,537
Just do it quick
before I change my mind.

1355
01:52:13,685 --> 01:52:14,891
Molly?

1356
01:52:16,605 --> 01:52:18,186
Molly, are you home?

1357
01:52:18,357 --> 01:52:19,517
It's Carl.

1358
01:52:20,317 --> 01:52:21,432
Molly!

1359
01:52:21,526 --> 01:52:22,686
Fire escape.

1360
01:52:30,077 --> 01:52:31,692
What's happening to me?

1361
01:52:35,874 --> 01:52:37,034
Molly?

1362
01:52:38,377 --> 01:52:39,537
Molly?

1363
01:52:48,303 --> 01:52:49,303
Molly!

1364
01:52:50,347 --> 01:52:51,883
Son of a bitch.

1365
01:53:04,987 --> 01:53:06,602
Come on.

1366
01:53:09,658 --> 01:53:11,444
Molly, look. Look.

1367
01:53:12,619 --> 01:53:14,826
Oh, let's go. Let's go.

1368
01:53:24,381 --> 01:53:25,666
Molly!

1369
01:53:26,049 --> 01:53:28,085
Just get away from us, Carl.

1370
01:53:31,305 --> 01:53:33,296
- Molly!
- You're just a liar. Liar!

1371
01:53:33,390 --> 01:53:35,470
Molly, you got to listen to me.
This woman's a thief.

1372
01:53:35,684 --> 01:53:37,015
- She's a con artist.
- Why?

1373
01:53:37,102 --> 01:53:40,060
- Why are you doing this?
- Don't listen to her, Molly.

1374
01:53:41,773 --> 01:53:43,183
Stop!

1375
01:53:43,275 --> 01:53:45,641
Just get away from us, Carl.
I've called the police.

1376
01:53:45,736 --> 01:53:46,736
Molly!

1377
01:53:56,538 --> 01:53:57,823
Shit.

1378
01:54:00,542 --> 01:54:04,376
- Carl, why are you doing this?
- Don't interfere, Molly. She's a thief.

1379
01:54:05,297 --> 01:54:08,084
All right, the check.
Just give me the check.

1380
01:54:08,216 --> 01:54:10,377
- Carl, no.
- Stay out of this, Molly!

1381
01:54:15,932 --> 01:54:16,932
Son of a bitch!

1382
01:54:17,517 --> 01:54:19,303
Keep out of this, Molly!

1383
01:54:20,645 --> 01:54:22,636
Get off of Mel

1384
01:54:27,903 --> 01:54:31,395
Where is it? Where is it?
Where is it, god damn it!

1385
01:54:31,948 --> 01:54:34,439
- I gave it away.
- You're lying to me.

1386
01:54:34,826 --> 01:54:37,818
Don't lie to me, god damn it!

1387
01:54:38,413 --> 01:54:40,574
The check.

1388
01:54:54,137 --> 01:54:57,425
I'll kill her, Sam.
I swear to god, I'll kill her.

1389
01:55:03,438 --> 01:55:09,399
Just... look, just give me the check,
Sam. Okay?

1390
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:13,232
I promise you I'll let her go
if you'll just give it to me.

1391
01:55:13,532 --> 01:55:14,817
Okay?

1392
01:55:16,201 --> 01:55:17,201
Sam?

1393
01:55:19,579 --> 01:55:20,785
Sam?

1394
01:56:37,407 --> 01:56:38,897
Sam.

1395
01:56:41,495 --> 01:56:44,658
Oh, Carl. “What?

1396
01:57:18,406 --> 01:57:19,406
No!

1397
01:57:52,816 --> 01:57:54,397
Are you two all right?

1398
01:57:58,446 --> 01:57:59,652
Sam?

1399
01:58:02,617 --> 01:58:03,777
Molly?

1400
01:58:06,204 --> 01:58:07,614
I can hear you.

1401
01:58:44,159 --> 01:58:45,820
Oh, god.

1402
01:59:33,667 --> 01:59:37,376
Sam? They're waiting for you, Sam.

1403
01:59:48,890 --> 01:59:50,426
I'll miss you.

1404
01:59:52,394 --> 01:59:54,601
Your mother'd be proud.

1405
01:59:54,896 --> 01:59:56,761
I'm gonna miss you, too, Sam.

1406
01:59:58,024 --> 01:59:59,560
You're all right.

1407
02:00:01,027 --> 02:00:02,437
Bye, oda Mae.

1408
02:00:03,905 --> 02:00:05,145
Bye, Sam.

1409
02:00:28,263 --> 02:00:29,673
I love you, Molly.

1410
02:00:32,308 --> 02:00:34,048
I've always loved you.

1411
02:00:41,109 --> 02:00:42,440
Ditto.

1412
02:01:03,631 --> 02:01:05,246
It's amazing, Molly.

1413
02:01:06,634 --> 02:01:10,627
The love inside, you take it with you.

1414
02:01:22,192 --> 02:01:23,477
See you.

1415
02:01:31,075 --> 02:01:32,315
See you.
