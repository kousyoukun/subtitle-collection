00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,392
<i>Sometimes Dr Lecter and I</i>
<i>would talk...</i>

3
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,391
<i>when things got quiet enough...</i>

4
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,471
<i>about the science courses</i>
<i>I was takin'.</i>

5
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,269
<i>Some kind of mail-order courses</i>
<i>in psychology, Nurse Barney?</i>

6
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,713
<i>No, sir.</i>

7
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,553
<i>I don't consider psychology</i>
<i>a science...</i>

8
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,108
<i>and neither did Dr Lecter.</i>

9
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,199
<i>Now, Barney...</i>

10
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,714
<i>while you were working</i>
<i>at the asylum...</i>

11
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:05,591
<i>you observed Clarice Starling</i>
<i>and Hannibal Lecter interacting.</i>

12
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,318
Interacting?

13
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,039
Talking to one another.

14
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,793
Yes.
Yes, it seemed to me that they...

15
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,270
I can see you're eager to justify
your consulting fee...

16
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,397
but why don't we start
with what you saw...

17
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,436
not what you thought about
what you saw?

18
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,798
Cordell, don't be like that.
Barney can give us his opinion.

19
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,919
Barney, give us your opinion
of what you saw.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,309
What was it between them?

21
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,593
Most of the time, Dr Lecter
didn't respond at all to visitors.

22
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,399
He'd just, for instance,
open his eyes long enough...

23
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,517
to insult some academic
who was there to look over him.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,514
With Starling,
he answered her questions.

25
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,229
She interested him.
She intrigued him.

26
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,676
He thought she was charming
and amusing.

27
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,393
So Clarice Starling
and Hannibal Lecter...

28
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,278
became friendly.

29
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,114
Inside a kind of formal structure,
yes.

30
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,317
And he was fond of her.

31
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,676
Yes.

32
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,988
Thank you, Barney.

33
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,991
Thank you very much
for your candour.

34
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,231
And keep all those wonderful items...

35
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,914
from your personal Lecter
treasure trove coming.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,718
I've enjoyed them immensely.

37
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,438
Mr Verger.

38
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,954
Oh, I almost forgot.

39
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,600
I might be able to get a cookie down.
What do you say, Cordell?

40
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,035
I think it would kill you.

41
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,118
- How much?
- Two hundred and fifty.

42
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,918
Thousand.

43
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,639
Cut a cheque for $250,000.

44
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,349
How can she sleep
at a time like this?

45
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,513
She's on a jump-out squad all night.
She's saving her strength.

46
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,470
We got some guy named Bolton
from the DC Police.

47
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,593
All right, everyone.
Pay attention. Here's the layout.

48
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,148
Excuse me.
I'm Officer Bolton, DC Police.

49
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,595
I can see that from your badge.
How do you do?

50
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,113
I'm in charge here.

51
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,316
Officer Bolton,
I'm Special Agent Starling.

52
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,470
Just so we don't get off
on the wrong foot...

53
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,630
let me explain
why we're all here.

54
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,679
I'm here because I know Evelda Drumgo.
I arrested her twice on RICO warrants.

55
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,274
DEA and ATF, in addition
to backing me up...

56
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,271
are here for the drugs
and the weapons.

57
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,158
You're here because our mayor
wants to appear tough on drugs...

58
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,390
especially after his own
cocaine conviction...

59
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,119
and hopes he can accomplish that
by having you join us here today.

60
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,116
You got a smart mouth, lady.

61
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,510
If you wouldn't mind, I'd appreciate it
if you'd let me continue.

62
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,711
All right, take a look.

63
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,633
Fish market.
Back's on the water.

64
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,915
Across the street, ground floor,
is the meth lab.

65
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,309
Evelda Drumgo's HIV positive.

66
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,631
She will spit and bite if cornered,
so you should watch it.

67
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,439
If you happen to be the one
who puts her in a patrol car...

68
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,353
in front of the news cameras, Bolton,
you don't wanna push her head down.

69
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,670
She'll likely have a needle
in her hair.

70
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,433
<i>We want to take her inside the building,</i>
<i>not out in the street.</i>

71
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,431
<i>We can get closest with the van.</i>

72
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,478
<i>If it looks good, on my signal</i>
<i>we hit the front, DEA hits the back...</i>

73
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,471
<i>DCPD backin'them up.</i>

74
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,676
<i>She'll have her watchers out</i>
<i>at least three blocks around.</i>

75
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,910
<i>They've tipped her before in time, so</i>
<i>let's not make spectacles of ourselves.</i>

76
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,914
- Pretty busy today.
- I agree.

77
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,157
Can I please get
a cup of coffee?

78
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,435
- Did you see that?
- That's a roger.

79
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,159
What's up, man?

80
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,079
Goddam it. It's her.

81
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,310
With three guys.
They're all packin'.

82
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,198
She's carryin' something.
She's got a baby.

83
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,556
<i>Hey, Brigham, it's too crowded.</i>

84
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,710
<i>There are too many people.</i>
<i>I say we call it off.</i>

85
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,949
What do you say?

86
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,996
<i>I agree.</i>

87
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,310
All units, stand down.

88
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,516
- Whisky team copies.
- Burke copy.

89
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,397
This is Bolton.
Stay on target.

90
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,074
I said all units stand down, Bolton,
right now.

91
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,196
<i>- It's too late. We're movin'in.</i>
- Bolton, he said it's off.

92
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,952
Stand down now.

93
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,951
She's carrying a baby.
I repeat, she's carrying a baby.

94
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,395
All units stand down.

95
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,436
<i>- Keep that gun down, Bolton.</i>
- Damn, dude got a piece.

96
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,192
- Light his ass up.
- It's a go!

97
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,713
FBI! Down on the ground!

98
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,918
Hold it!

99
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,911
Hold your fire!

100
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,114
Don't!

101
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,389
Evelda, get out of the car!

102
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,758
Starling, is that you?

103
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,836
Step away from the car!

104
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,396
Show me your hands, Evelda.

105
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,998
Please.
Show me your hands.

106
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,593
How've you been?

107
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,318
Don't do this.

108
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,435
Do what?

109
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,550
It's all right. It's okay.

110
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,473
I know, I know. Baby, I know.

111
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,915
It's okay.

112
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,150
It's okay.

113
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,151
It's all right.

114
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,390
<i>Friends, family and coworkers</i>
<i>gathered here this morning...</i>

115
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,439
<i>at Arlington National Cemetery</i>
<i>to bury BA TF Agent John Brigham...</i>

116
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,717
<i>shot and killed in the line of duty</i>
<i>Friday. He was 40 years old.</i>

117
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,951
<i>This ill-fated drug raid that claimed</i>
<i>his life and five others...</i>

118
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,508
<i>is the latest in a seemingly</i>
<i>endless series of incidents...</i>

119
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,318
<i>beginning with Waco, Texas...</i>

120
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,597
<i>in which theJustice Department</i>
<i>and the FBI have been questioned...</i>

121
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,433
<i>about their use of firepower</i>
<i>rather than judgment.</i>

122
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,080
<i>This time it was FBI</i>
<i>Special Agent Clarice Starling...</i>

123
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,832
<i>heading up</i>
<i>the calamitous strike force.</i>

124
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,356
<i>Agent Starling attained some measure</i>
<i>of celebrity ten years ago...</i>

125
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,637
<i>when she was given information</i>
<i>by Dr Hannibal "The Cannibal"Lecter...</i>

126
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,790
<i>which led to the rescue</i>
<i>of Catherine Martin...</i>

127
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,155
<i>daughter of the former US senator</i>
<i>from Tennessee.</i>

128
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,869
<i>When she returns to work this week,</i>
<i>she won't be so celebrated.</i>

129
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,793

131
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,598
Cordell!

132
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,713
- Yes, sir.
- Get me the justice Department.

133
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,918
<i>Agent Starling?</i>

134
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,595
<i>This is John Eldridge from DEA.</i>
<i>Assistant Director Noonan, you know.</i>

135
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,672
Larkin Wayne from our Office
of Professional Responsibility.

136
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,671
Bob Sneed, ATF.

137
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,797
Benny Holcombe, assistant to the mayor.
And Paul Krendler.

138
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,314
You know Paul.
Paul's come over from justice...

139
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,789
unofficially,
as a favour to us.

140
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,314
In other words, he's here,
and he's not here.

141
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,072
So I take it you've seen the coverage
in the papers and on television?

142
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,628
I have nothing to do with the news,
Mr Krendler.

143
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,393
The woman had a baby in her arms.

144
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,358
There are pictures. You could
see the problem, I would think.

145
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,591
Not in her arms.
In a carrier across her chest.

146
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,750
In her arms she had a MAC-10.

147
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,798
Look, we're here to help you,
Starling.

148
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,758
It's gonna be a hell of a lot harder
to do with a combative attitude.

149
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,114
Can I speak freely, Mr Pearsall?

150
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,678
Your agency called this office to get me
assigned to help you on this raid.

151
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,637
I tried to do that.

152
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,598
I clearly expressed my judgment
and was ignored.

153
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,638
And now a good agent and a friend
is dead.

154
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,108
You shot and killed five people
out there, Agent Starling.

155
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,316
Is that how you define
good judgment?

156
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,236
This raid was an ugly mess.

157
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,312
I ended up in a position
where I had a choice of dying...

158
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,311
or shooting a woman
carrying a child.

159
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,550
I chose.

160
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,232
I shot her.

161
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,509
I killed a mother
holding her child.

162
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,909
And I regret it.
I resent myself for it.

163
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,389
Gentlemen, I'm going
to call a halt to this meeting...

164
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,789
and get back to you individually
by phone.

165
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,911
That was a waste of time.

166
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,830
You have a secret admirer, Starling.

167
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,356
He isn't much to look at,
but he does have friends in high places.

168
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,119
Remember Mason Verger?

169
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,668
Lecter's fourth victim.

170
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,193
The rich one.

171
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,589
The only one that survived.

172
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,234
He says he has some new information
on Lecter he'll only share with you.

173
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,790
What do you mean, only share it with me?
You want it, seize it.

174
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,917
- I'd rather not.
- I wasn't speaking to you.

175
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,389
When I speak to you, you'll know it
because I'll look at you.

176
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,513
Why would we rather not?

177
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,070
The last time he called was when we took
Lecter off the Ten Most Wanted List.

178
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,515
He was upset about that.
We said, "Hey, that's life."

179
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,797
<i>He said, "This is a Senate</i>
<i>Oversight Committee...</i>

180
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,393
<i>to make your life miserable. "</i>

181
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,358
His family's political contributions
may not be enough...

182
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,078
to buy a senator...

183
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,071
but they are enough
to rent them from time to time.

184
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,350
There's no reason to go through that
if he really does have something new.

185
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,154
<i>It's a good deal for you, Starling.</i>
<i>You can't pretend it isn't.</i>

186
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,391
<i>Get to go back</i>
<i>on a celebrated case.</i>

187
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,711
I'll take care of the media
for your Drumgo killing.

188
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,119
Everyone's gonna be happy.

189
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,158
I'm not happy.

190
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,913
Well, maybe you're incapable
of being happy.

191
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,956
Mr. Krendler...

192
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,397
out on the street, you know you might
take a bullet in the line of duty.

193
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,789
You accept it, or you get out.

194
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,632
You live with it.

195
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,314
What you don't expect or accept...

196
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,960
is taking one in the back
in your boss's office...

197
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,110
for doing your job
exactly as they've taught you.

198
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,792
That makes you unhappy.

199
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,111
Of course you're right, Starling...

200
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,111
but it doesn't change anything.

201
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,272
It changes everything.
It changes me.

202
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,917
Hi, I'm Cordell Doemling,
Mr Verger's private physician.

203
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,513
How do you do?

204
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,956
If you'd be so kind
as to park down at the end.

205
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,719
One's eyes adjust to the darkness.

206
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,637
Mr Verger,
Agent Starling is here.

207
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,393
Good morning, Mr Verger.

208
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,710
Was that a Mustang
I heard out there?

209
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,869
Yes, it was.

210
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,712
Five-litre?

211
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,392
Yes.

212
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,789
Fast.

213
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,314
Cordell, I think
you can leave us now.

214
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,598
I thought I might stay.
Perhaps I could be useful.

215
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,719
You could be useful
seeing about my lunch.

216
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,476
I'll attach this microphone to your
clothing or pillow, if that's okay.

217
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,596
By all means.

218
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,431
Here, this should make it easier.

219
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,269
You know, I thank God...

220
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,112
for what happened.

221
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,270
It was my salvation.

222
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,711
Have you accepted jesus,
Agent Starling?

223
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,234
- Do you have faith?
- I was raised Lutheran.

224
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,788
That's not what I asked.

225
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,111
This is Special Agent
Clarice Starling, 51 <i>4369</i>0...

226
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,919
deposing Mason R. Verger on March 20,
sworn and attested.

227
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,833
I want to tell you about summer camp.
It was a wonderful childhood experience.

228
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,798
- We can get to that later.
- We can get to it now.

229
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,631
You see, it all comes to bear.

230
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,077
It was a Christian camp
my father founded...

231
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,472
for poor, unfortunate, cast-off
little boys and girls...

232
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,199
who would do anything
for a candy bar.

233
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,714
Mr Verger, I don't need to know
about the sex offences.

234
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,110
It's all right.
I have immunity from the US Attorney.

235
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,270
And I have immunity...

236
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,193
from the risen jesus.

237
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,714
And nobody beats the Riz.

238
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,517
Had you ever seen Dr Lecter before the
court assigned you to him for therapy?

239
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,919
What do you mean?

240
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,718
Socially?

241
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,317
It is what I mean, yes,
if you don't mind talking about it.

242
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,311
No, not at all.
I'm not ashamed.

243
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,517
- I didn't say you should be.
- No, we met conventionally...

244
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,556
as doctor and patient.

245
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,358
How did he end up at your house?

246
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,238
I invited him, of course...

247
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,914
<i>to my pied-à-terre.</i>

248
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,993
<i>I came to the door</i>
<i>in my nicest come-hither outfit.</i>

249
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,991
<i>I was concerned...</i>

250
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,231
<i>that he'd be afraid of me.</i>

251
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,596
<i>But he didn't seem to be</i>
<i>afraid of me.</i>

252
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,716
That's almost funny now.

253
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,991
<i>I showed him my toys...</i>

254
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,878
<i>my noose set-up,</i>
<i>among other things.</i>

255
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,033
It's where you sort of hang yourself,
but not really.

256
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,156
<i>It feels good while you...</i>

257
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,956
well, you know.

258
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,268
Anyway...

259
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,717
<i>- he said, "Mason..."</i>
- Mason, would you like a popper?

260
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,996
And I said, "Would I? Oh, wow!"

261
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,674
<i>Once that kicked in,</i>
<i>I was flying.</i>

262
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,469
<i>He said,</i>
<i>"Mason, show me how you smile...</i>

263
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,996
<i>to gain the confidence</i>
<i>of a child. "</i>

264
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,913
When I smiled...

265
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,798
<i>he said,</i>
<i>"Oh, I see how you do it."</i>

266
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,396
<i>The good doctor approached me</i>
<i>with a piece of broken mirror.</i>

267
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,515
<i>"Try this."</i>

268
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,398
Try peeling off your face...

269
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,794
And feeding it to the dogs.

270
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,359
No, I can still see it.

271
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,555
Try again.

272
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,114
No, I'm afraid not.

273
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,794
<i>That's entertainment</i>

274
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,236
Well, it seemed like
a good idea at the time.

275
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,195
You indicated to me that you'd received
some kind of new information.

276
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,030
Where did this come from?

277
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,112
Buenos Aires.
I received it two weeks ago.

278
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,348
Where's the package it came in?

279
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,796
Good question. There was nothing
written on it of interest.

280
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,677
Did we throw it out?

281
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,671
Yes, I'm afraid we did.

282
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,399
Oh, dear.
You think it'll help?

283
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,391
I hope so.

284
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,391
I hope it'll help you catch him...

285
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,110
to help cleanse the stigma
of your recent dishonour.

286
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,792
Thank you. That's all I need.

287
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,713
Did you find some rapport
with Dr Lecter...

288
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,234
in your talks at the asylum?

289
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,239
I know I did
while I was peeling.

290
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,118
We exchanged information
in a civil way.

291
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,589
But always through the glass.

292
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,193
Yes.

293
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,231
- Isn't it funny?
- What's that?

294
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,831
You can look at my face...

295
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,317
but you shied when I said
the name of God.

296
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,711
- Finding what you want?
- Are you sure this is all of it?

297
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,711
That's all there is now.

298
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,110
There was more, but it's been picked
over little by little over the years.

299
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,996
You know, this stuff's worth
a lot of money in certain circles.

300
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,795
It's kind of like the cocaine
that disappears around here...

301
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,199
little by little.

302
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,038
Hey, Barney.

303
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,395
Remember me?

304
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,675
Would you agree for the record,
Agent Starling...

305
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,512
that I've not been read my rights?

306
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:10,156
I have not Mirandized Barney.
He is unaware of his rights.

307
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,075
So when you turned Dr Lecter over
to the Tennessee police...

308
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:18,073
They weren't civil to him.
They're all dead now.

309
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,390
They only survived his company
three days.

310
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,199
You survived him
six years at the asylum.

311
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,317
How'd you do that?
It wasn't just being civil.

312
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,039
Yes, it was.

313
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,237
Did you ever think, after he escaped,
he might come after you?

314
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,309
No.

315
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,595
He once told me that,
whenever feasible...

316
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,671
he preferred to eat the rude.

317
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,719
"Free-range rude," he called 'em.
What about you?

318
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,997
You ever think he might come after you?
You ever think about him at all?

319
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,311
At least <i>3</i>0 seconds of every day.
I can't help it.

320
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,153
He's always with me,
like a bad habit.

321
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,194
Do you know what happened to his stuff...
his books, papers, drawings?

322
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,874
Everything got thrown away
when the place closed.

323
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,076
Cutbacks.

324
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,232
I just found out that Dr Lecter's
signed copy of <i>TheJoy of Cooking...</i>

325
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,710
sold to a private collector
for $ 1 <i>6</i>,000.

326
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,870
It was probably a fake.

327
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,794
The seller's affidavit of ownership
was signed "Karen Phlox."

328
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,997
Do you know Karen Phlox?
You should.

329
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,834
She filled out your employment
application, but signed it "Barney."

330
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,910
Same thing on your tax returns.

331
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,474
You want the book?
Maybe I can get it back.

332
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:35,792
I want the X ray of Lecter's arm
you broke in the attack on that nurse...

333
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,916
and everything else you've got.

334
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,269
We used to talk about
a lot of things at night...

335
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,113
after the screamin'
finally died down.

336
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,918
We talked about you sometimes.
You wanna know what he said?

337
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,150
Go get the X ray.

338
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,911
I'm not a bad guy.

339
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,513
I didn't say you were.

340
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,989
Dr Chilton was a bad guy.

341
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,119
After your first visit, he started
taping your conversations with Lecter.

342
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,908
These are valuable.

343
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,076
Go on now.

344
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,469
You've grieved long enough.

345
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,556
And what'd he say?

346
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,551
What'd he say about me
late at night?

347
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,593
He was talking about
inherited, hardwired behaviour.

348
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,513
He was using genetics
in the roller pigeons as an example.

349
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,116
They fly up in the air, roll backwards
in a display, fallin' to the ground.

350
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,476
<i>There are shallow rollers,</i>
<i>and there are deep rollers.</i>

351
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,471
<i>You can't breed two deep rollers...</i>

352
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,632
<i>or their young, their offspring,</i>
<i>will roll all the way down...</i>

353
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,915
<i>hit and die.</i>

354
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,912
<i>Agent Starling is a deep roller,</i>
<i>Barney.</i>

355
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,436
<i>Let us hope one of her parents</i>
<i>was not.</i>

356
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,069
<i>Surely the odd confluence of events</i>
<i>hasn't escaped you, Clarice.</i>

357
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,113
<i>Jack Crawford dangles you</i>
<i>in front of me...</i>

358
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,794
<i>then I give you a bit of help.</i>

359
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,075
<i>Do you think it's because</i>
<i>I like to look at you...</i>

360
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,914
<i>and imagine how good</i>
<i>you would taste...</i>

361
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,230
<i>Clarice?</i>

362
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,788
<i>I don't know. Is it?</i>

363
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,314
<i>I've been in this room</i>
<i>for eight years now, Clarice.</i>

364
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,992
<i>I know they will never, ever</i>
<i>let me out while I'm alive.</i>

365
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,316
<i>What I want is a view.</i>

366
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,109
<i>I want a window where I</i>
<i>can see a tree or even water.</i>

367
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,668
<i>I want to be in a federal institution</i>
<i>far away from Dr Chilton.</i>

368
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,310
<i>The Capponi correspondence</i>
<i>goes back to the 13th century.</i>

369
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,073
Dr Fell might hold in his hand...

370
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,116
his non-Italian hand...

371
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,509
a note from Dante Alighieri himself.

372
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,353
But would he recognize it?
I think not.

373
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,711
Gentlemen, you have examined him
in medieval Italian...

374
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,314
<i>and I will not deny</i>
<i>that his language is admirable...</i>

375
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,516
<i>for a</i> straniero.

376
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,717
<i>But is he acquainted</i>
<i>with the personalities...</i>

377
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,472
<i>of the pre-Renaissance Firenze?</i>

378
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,271
I think not.

379
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,920
What if he came upon a note
in the Capponi library...

380
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,468
say from Guido di Cavalcanti?

381
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:37,189
Would he recognize that?
I think not.

382
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,589
They're still arguing?

383
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,880
Sogliato wants the job
for his nephew.

384
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,317
But the scholars seem satisfied
with the temporary guy they appointed.

385
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,868
If he's such an expert on Dante...

386
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,633
let him lecture on Dante
to the <i>Studiolo.</i>

387
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,473
- Let him face them if he can.
- I look fo<i>rw</i>ard to it.

388
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,988
Very well. On the 1 <i>4</i>th.

389
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,920
Dr Fell?

390
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,639
Chief Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi
of the <i>questura.</i>

391
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,110
<i>Commendatore,</i>
how can I be of service?

392
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,919
Sorry. I'm investigating
the disappearance...

393
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,073
of your predecessor,
Signor di Bonaventura.

394
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,879
- I was wondering if...
- "Predecessor" implies I have the job.

395
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,509
Unfortunately, I don't.
Not yet, though I am hopeful.

396
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,229
They are letting me look after
the library for a stipend.

397
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,996
The officers who first checked...

398
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,993
didn't find any sort of farewell
or suicide note.

399
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,559
I was wondering if you...

400
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,110
If I come across anything in the Capponi
library stuffed in a drawer or book...

401
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,077
I'll call you at once.

402
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,877
Thank you.

403
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,637
You've been reassigned.

404
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,715
Pardon?

405
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,076
You were on the <i>II Mostro</i> case,
I'm sure I read.

406
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,390
- Yes, that's right.
- Now you're on this.

407
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,313
This is much less grand a case,
I would think.

408
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,915
Well, if I thought of my work
in those terms...

409
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,558
yes, I guess I'd agree.

410
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,589
- A missing person.
- Sorry?

411
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:30,468
Were you unfairly dismissed from
the grander case, or did you deserve it?

412
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,914
Regarding this one, Dr Fell...

413
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,833
are the signore's personal effects
still at the Palazzo?

414
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,790
Packed neatly in four cases
with an inventory.

415
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,394
Alas, no note.

416
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:56,112
I'll send someone over to pick them up.
Thank you for your help.

417
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,198
Hey, thanks.

418
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,711
How's it going? Any leads?

419
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,792
Yeah, they're all leads.
They just don't lead to him.

420
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,231
I don't know how you live
with this stuff.

421
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,675
Oh, God.

422
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,274
This is from the <i>Guinness Book</i>
<i>of World Records</i> congratulating me...

423
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,830
on being the female FBI agent
who has shot and killed the most people.

424
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,351
Would you excuse me, please?

425
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,430
Sure.

426
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,159
<i>Dear Clarice...</i>

427
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,479

428
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,711
<i>My own never bothered me</i>

<i>of being incarcerated.</i>

430
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,870
<i>But you may lack perspective.</i>

431
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,196
<i>In our discussions</i>
<i>down in the dungeon...</i>

432
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,955

<i>figures largely</i>
<i>in your value system.</i>

434

<i>pleased you most because you could</i>

436
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:00,309
<i>But now, alas,</i>

437
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,994
<i>Do you imagine your daddy</i>

<i>Do you see him</i>

00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,197
<i>the sorry, petty end</i>

<i>What is worst</i>

442
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,355
<i>Is it how your failure will reflect</i>

443
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,399
<i>Is your worst fear that people</i>

00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,392
<i>they were indeed just good old</i>

<i>tornado-bait white trash...</i>

446
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,910
<i>and that perhaps you are too?</i>

447
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,952
<i>By the way, I couldn't help noticing</i>
<i>on the FBI's rather dull web site...</i>

448
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:40,716
<i>that I've been hoisted from the Bureau's</i>
<i>archives of the common criminal...</i>

449
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,792
<i>and elevated to the more prestigious</i>
<i>Ten Most Wanted List.</i>

450
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,239
<i>Is this coincidence,</i>
<i>or are you back on the case?</i>

451
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,630
<i>If so, goody goody, because</i>
<i>I need to come out of retirement...</i>

452
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,029
<i>and return to public life.</i>

453
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,668
<i>I imagine you sitting</i>

<i>Please tell me truly,</i>

458
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:20,353
<i>PS: Clearly this new assignment</i>
<i>is not your choice.</i>

459
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,351
<i>Rather, I suppose,</i>
<i>it is part of the bargain.</i>

460
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,113
<i>But you accepted it, Clarice.</i>

461
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,714
<i>Yourjob is to craft my doom...</i>

462
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,473
<i>so I'm not sure how well</i>
<i>I should wish you...</i>

463
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,915
<i>but I'm sure</i>
<i>we'll have a lot of fun.</i>

464
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,638
<i>Ta-ta.</i>

465
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,711
<i>"H."</i>

466
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,834
On the letter...

467
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,639
there's one partial fingerprint here.

468
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,678
- Not enough to hold up in court.
- I know it's him.

469
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,910
Where he was when he wrote it
is what I need.

470
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,230
Well, the paper isn't gonna help.

471
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,118
Yes, it's linen fibre,
yes, it's on the expensive side...

472
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,398
but it's not so rare that you won't find
it in a thousand stationery stores...

473
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,436
throughout the world.

474
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,069
It's the same with the ink,
and the same with the wax.

475
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,390
And your Las Vegas postmark?

476
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:13,109
You can check it out, but I'll bet you
it came from a remailing service.

477
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,430
Las Vegas would be
the last place he'd be.

478
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,432
It'd be an assault
on his sense of taste.

479
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:28,514
<i>Don't you feel eyes</i>
<i>moving over your body, Clarice?</i>

480
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,238
<i>I hardly see how you couldn't.</i>

481
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,237
<i>And don't your eyes move</i>
<i>over the things you want?</i>

482
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,397
<i>All right, then. Tell me how.</i>

483
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,708
<i>No.</i>

484
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,870
<i>It's your turn to tell me, Clarice.</i>

485
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,112
<i>You don't have any more vacations</i>
<i>to sell on Anthrax Island.</i>

486
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,236
<i>Quid pro quo, Clarice.</i>

487
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,039
<i>I tell you things,</i>
<i>you tell me things.</i>

488
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,351
<i>Not about this case.</i>
<i>About yourself.</i>

489
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,998
<i>Quid pro quo.</i>

490
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,833
<i>Yes or no, Clarice?</i>

491
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,591
Hand cream.

492
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,709
Raw ambergris base.

493
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,310
Tennessee lavender.

494
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,629
Trace of something else.

495
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,349
Fleece.

496
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,117
Lovely.

497
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,909
- What's ambergris?
- Ambergris is a whale product.

498
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,719
Alas, much as we'd like to,
we can't import it.

499
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,473
Endangered Species Act.

500
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,790
- Where isn't it illegal?
- Japan, of course.

501
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,916
Couple of places in Europe.

502
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,912
You'd almost certainly find it
somewhere in Paris...

503
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,309
Rome, Amsterdam.

504
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,594
Maybe London.

505
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,912
This bouquet was hand-engineered
to someone's specifications.

506
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,595
- Is there a way of knowing which shops?
- Of course. We'll give you a list.

507
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,513
It'll be short.

508
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,550
I need opera tickets.

509
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,995
I don't think I got any on me.

510
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,514
It's sold out,
whatever it's called.

511
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,309
It's the pretty, young wife with the
ever-open beak who needs opera tickets.

512
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,913
- Benetti.
- What?

513
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,194
Rewind it.

514
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,113
I can't rewind it.
I'm making a copy. I'm recording.

515
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,514
What is this?

516
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,273
Security camera from a perfume shop
in Via Della Scala.

517
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,271
FBI, through Interpol,
requested a copy.

518
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,669
- Why?
- They didn't say.

519
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,552
- They didn't say?
- No. It was actually kind of weird.

520
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,393
They were making a point
not to say.

521
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,312
- Are we going to the opera?
- Yes.

522
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,914
Sorry. Yes, we are going.

523
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,831
You got tickets?

524
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,230
No, but I will. In fact,
I was just about to look here.

525
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,473
Please, not the back row.
I would like to see it this time.

526
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,756
Nowhere near the back row...

527
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,115
no matter what the cost.

528
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,110
<i>Tell me, Clarice,</i>
<i>would you want to harm...</i>

529
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,236
<i>those who forced you</i>
<i>to consider it, though?</i>

530
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,356
<i>It's perfectly okay to admit it.</i>

531
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,238
<i>It's perfectly au naturel...</i>

532
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,038
<i>to want to taste the enemy.</i>

533
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,550
<i>It just feels so good.</i>
<i>Tell me, Clarice.</i>

534
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,915
<i>What is your worst memory</i>
<i>of childhood?</i>

535
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,468
- Jesus, Starling!
- Can I help you, Mr Krendler?

536
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,471
What are you doing
sitting there in the dark?

537
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,198
Thinking about cannibalism.

538
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:47,989
People in justice are thinking too.
You know that?

539
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,036
They're thinking, "What exactly
is she doing about Lecter?"

540
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,395
Aren't you curious
why he dines on his victims?

541
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,596
What's the point of that?

542
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,591
Are you writing a book
or are you catching a crook?

543
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:59,752
To show his contempt
for those who exasperate him.

544
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,833
Or sometimes to perform
a public service.

545
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,388
In the case of the flautist,
Benjamin Raspail...

546
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,553
he did it to improve the sound of
the Baltimore Philharmonic Orchestra...

547
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,552
serving the not-so-talented flute
player's sweetbreads to the board...

548
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,313
with a nice Montrachet
at $ 700 a bottle.

549
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,152
Wow.

550
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,993
That meal began with green oysters
from the Gironde...

551
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:25,231
followed by the sweetbreads,
a sorbet...

552
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,959
and then you can read here
in <i>Gourmet Cuisine:</i>

553
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:31,635
"A notable dark and glossy ragout,
the constituents never determined."

554
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,472
I always figured him
for a queer.

555
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,357
Why would you say that, Paul?

556
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:39,193
All this artsy-fartsy stuff.

557
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,068
Chamber music, tea-party food.
Not that I mean anything personal...

558
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,277
if you've got a lot of sympathy
for those people.

559
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,719
What I came to impress
upon you, Starling...

560
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,711
is I better see cooperation.

561
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,109
There are no little fiefdoms here.

562
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,839
I want to be copied
on every <i>3</i>02, you understand?

563
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,917
If you work with me...

564
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,912
then your so-called career here
might improve.

565
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:09,353
If you don't,
then all I have to do...

566
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,716
is draw a line through your name
rather than under it...

567
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,119
and it's over.

568
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,509
Paul, what is it with you?

569
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,592
I told you to go home to your wife.
That was wrong?

570
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,717
What? Don't flatter yourself,
Starling.

571
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,360
That was a long time ago.

572
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,000
Why would I hold that
against you?

573
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,671
And besides...

574
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,274
this town is full
of cornpone, country pussy.

575
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,598
That said...

576
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,672
I wouldn't mind having a go with you
right now, if you want to reconsider.

577
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:44,036
In the gym, anytime. No pads.

578
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,629
Is it possible it went out
with the regular mail?

579
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,679
<i>No, I overnighted it to you.</i>
<i>I filled out the slip myself.</i>

580
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,830
<i>This was the day after your request.</i>

581
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,912
I did it right away.
I don't understand what happened.

582
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,638
You should have it by now.

583
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,915
I don't.
Can you send me another one?

584
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,468
<i>Sure, I'll make another copy</i>
<i>especially for you.</i>

585
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:10,155
Agent Clarice? Is that right?
Can I call you Clarice?

586
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,559
<i>Agent Starling.</i>

587
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:14,279
I'd appreciate it.
What's your name?

588
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,078
My name is Franco Benetti.

589
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,071
<i>Agent Franco Benetti.</i>

590
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,390
- Thank you very much, Agent Benetti.
<i>- Okay.</i>

591
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,914
- So I'll send you tomorrow?
<i>- All right.</i>

592
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,594
Bye-bye.

593
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,716
Nothin', huh?

594
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,155
Nothin' yet.
Still waitin' on Florence and London.

595
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,991
<i>The number you have dialled</i>
<i>is not in service at this time.</i>

596
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,389
<i>Please check the number...</i>

597
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,318
<i>Yes?</i>

598
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:38,473
I have information
about Hannibal Lecter.

599
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,199
<i>Have you shared your information</i>
<i>with the police, sir?</i>

600
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,794
<i>I'm required</i>
<i>to encourage you to do so.</i>

601
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:49,718
Is the reward payable
under special circumstances?

602
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,109
<i>May I suggest you contact</i>
<i>an attorney...</i>

603
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,714
<i>before taking any possibly</i>
<i>illegal action?</i>

604
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,792
<i>There's one in Geneva</i>
<i>who's excellent in these matters.</i>

605
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,791
<i>May I give you his toll-free number?</i>

606
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:05,716
<i>The number is 004123317.</i>

607
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,109
<i>Thank you for calling.</i>

608
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,918
Yes. I was just speaking
with someone who suggested...

609
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,116
<i>There's a $ 100,000 advance.</i>

610
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,111
<i>To qualify for the advance...</i>

611
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,158
<i>a fingerprint must be provided,</i>
in situ, <i>on an object.</i>

612
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,516
<i>Once the print</i>
<i>has been positively identified...</i>

613
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,068
<i>the balance of the money</i>
<i>will be placed in escrow...</i>

614
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,912
<i>at Geneve Credit Suisse...</i>

615
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,278
<i>and may be viewed at any time</i>
<i>subject to 24-hour prior notification.</i>

616
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,920
<i>To repeat the message in French,</i>
<i>press two.</i>

617
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,719
<i>In Spanish, press three.</i>
<i>In German...</i>

618
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,074
Dr Fell, it's Inspector Pazzi.

619
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,549
<i>Yes, I can see you.</i>

620
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,278
Come on up.

621
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,518
Dr Fell?

622
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,076
Snap.

623
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,515
I should have encouraged you
to bring someone along.

624
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,511
The cases are on the heavy side.

625
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,875
Maybe you could help me
with them.

626
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,628
Just down the stairs, I mean.

627
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,232
Yeah.

628
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,993
This way.

629
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,389
Here we are.

630
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,280
- Is that the inventory?
- Yes.

631
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:49,232
- May I see it?
- Of course.

632
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:03,508
You are a Pazzi
of the Pazzi family, I think.

633
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:08,918
Wasn't it at the Palazzo Vecchio
your ancestor was hanged?

634
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,592
Francesco de' Pazzi.

635
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,911
Yes, thrown naked with a noose
around his neck from a window.

636
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,555
Writhing and kicking
alongside the archbishop...

637
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,518
against the cold stone wall.

638
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,592
In fact, I found
a very nice rendering of it...

639
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,319
here in the library the other day.

640
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,915
If you like, perhaps
I could sneak it out for you.

641
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,919
I would think that might
jeopardize your chances...

642
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,878
for permanent appointment
to the curatorship.

643
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,916
Only if you told.

644
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:43,078
Remind me...
what was his crime?

645
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:45,799
He was accused of killing
Giuliano de' Medici.

646
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,108
Unjustly?

647
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,795
No, I don't think so.

648
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,713
Then he wasn't just accused.
He did it. He was guilty.

649
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:57,918
I think that would make living
in Florence with the name Pazzi...

650
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,072
uncomfortable,
even 500 years later.

651
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,196
Not really.

652
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:07,590
In fact, I can't remember
the last time...

653
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,159
before today...

654
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,151
someone brought it up.

655
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,236
People don't always tell you
what they're thinking.

656
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,470
They just see to it you don't...

657
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:27,518
advance in life.

658
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:33,680
I'm sorry, <i>Commendatore.</i>

659
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,228
I too often say what I'm thinking.

660
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,951
I'll be right back to help you.

661
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:58,556
You know, the room you're standing in
was built in the 15th century.

662
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,358
It's beautiful.

663
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:03,198
Yes, it is.

664
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,396
Unfortunately, I think...

665
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:09,314
the heating system was installed
about the same time.

666
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,517
- That's a pity.
- Yes.

667
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,472
Okey-dokey.
Let's drag these down.

668
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,914
Must be as heavy as bodies.

669
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,714
- And the set?
- Eight thousand.

670
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,119
Okay.

671
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,793
Hey, how much is this?

672
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,075
- Fifty thousand.
- I'll take it.

673
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,393
Well done.

674
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,395
When you go for his wallet,
he'll catch you by the wrist.

675
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,471
I have done this
a few times, Inspector.

676
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,471
Not like this.

677
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,716
If there isn't a clean print
on the bracelet...

678
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,951
you'll spend the summer
in a cell at the Sollicciano.

679
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:52,350
Give me the bracelet.

680
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,911
Wash your fucking hands.

681
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,471
He's coming.

682
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,277
I got it.

683
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,071
He grabbed me just right.

684
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,468
Tried to hit me in the balls.

685
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,191
But he missed.

686
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:18,798
Let me help you.

687
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,711
No. Don't.

688
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:17,111
Sixteen-point match, Mr Verger.

689
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,155
Bingo.

690
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,868
- <i>Carlo?</i>
- Mason?

691
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,669
Well, well, well.

692
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,594
- Am I coming to see you?
- <i>Yes, soon, I hope.</i>

693
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:53,116
But first I need you
to pack off the boys.

694
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,191
- <i>Now?</i>
- Yes, I know.

695
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,999
The day you never
thought would arrive has.

696
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:00,514
<i>Now, Cordell will fax</i>
<i>the veterinary forms...</i>

697
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:03,637
<i>directly to</i>
<i>Animal and Plant Health...</i>

698
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:05,631
<i>but you need to get</i>
<i>the vet affidavits...</i>

699
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,278
from Sardinia.

700
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,519
How are they?

701
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:15,034
<i>They are big, Mason,</i>
<i>very big.</i>

702
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,513
- Say again?
- <i>Yeah, they are big, Mason.</i>

703
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:28,309
Really big.
Maybe 270 kilos.

704
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,789
Oh, wow.

705
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,393
Can you hear?

706
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,310
They sound fantastic.

707
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,194
Super.

708
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:35,669
The full balance of the money is payable
upon receipt of the doctor, alive.

709
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,228
Of course, you won't have to
seize him yourself.

710
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:40,151
Rather, just point him out.

711
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:44,953
It's preferable to all concerned if
that's the extent of your involvement...

712
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,632
from this point.

713
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:50,633
I prefer to stay involved,
make sure things go right.

714
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,551
Professionals will see to that.

715
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:56,158
I am a professional.

716
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:16,069
Did you enjoy the performance,
<i>Commendatore?</i>

717
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,991
Very much.

718
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:22,278
Allegra, this is Dr Fell,
curator of the Capponi Library.

719
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:23,634
Signora Pazzi.

720
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:25,551
I'm honoured.

721
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:27,471
Are you from America,
Doctor?

722
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:30,074
Not originally.
I've travelled there.

723
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:33,072
I've always wanted to visit.
New England, especially.

724
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:35,833
I've enjoyed many
excellent meals there.

725
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,390
I noticed you wrapped up
in the libretto.

726
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,311
Thought this might amuse you.

727
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:47,158
Dante's first sonnet
from <i>La Vita Nuova.</i>

728
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:49,071
It's beautiful.

729
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:53,078
- Rinaldo, look at this.
- I can see.

730
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,750
"Joyous Love seemed to me...

731
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:59,798
the while he held
my heart in his hands...

732
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,552
and in his arms...

733
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:03,915
my lady lay asleep...

734
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,831
wrapped in a veil."

735
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:07,994
"He woke her then...

736
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:12,676
and trembling and obedient, she ate
that burning heart out of his hand.

737
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,830
Weeping, I saw him
then depart from me."

738
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:20,594
Dr Fell, do you believe a man could
become so obsessed with a woman...

739
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:23,148
from a single encounter?

740
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:26,038
Could he daily feel
a stab of hunger for her...

741
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:28,918
and find nourishment
in the very sight of her?

742
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,116
I think so.

743
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:35,432
But would she see through the bars
of his plight and ache for him?

744
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,715
- Please keep that.
- I couldn't.

745
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,313
I insist.

746
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,515
Goodbye.

747
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:54,838
- Let's get something to eat.
- Of course.

748
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,751
Why not?

749
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,831
Is that you, Doctor?

750
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:21,398
<i>I'd like to speak with</i>
<i>Chief Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi, please.</i>

751
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:24,552
<i>This is Agent Clarice Starling</i>
<i>from the American FBI.</i>

752
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:25,868
<i>One moment.</i>

753
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:31,158
- FBI.
- I'm not here.

754
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:36,915
<i>Inspector Pazzi.</i>

755
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,719
It's Agent Starling
from the FBI. How do you do?

756
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:43,270
Actually, I was just
leaving for the day.

757
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:45,396
- Can I call you back tomorrow?
- <i>This won't take long.</i>

758
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:50,349
First, thank you for sending us the
security tape from the perfume store.

759
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:53,910
<i>When I say 'you, "I mean</i>
<i>your department... Agent Benetti.</i>

760
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,072
<i>Is he there?</i>
<i>Can I speak with him?</i>

761
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:59,958
- I'm sorry. He's gone home.
- <i>That's all right.</i>

762
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:02,190
I should tell you this
rather than him anyway.

763
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:04,475
I'm late for
an important appointment.

764
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:07,074
The person I'm looking for,
Inspector...

765
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:10,038
who is indeed shown on that tape,
is Hannibal Lecter.

766
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:11,633
Who?

767
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:14,518
Dr Hannibal Lecter.
You've never heard of him?

768
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:18,195
- I'm not familiar.
- <i>And the tape confirms...</i>

769
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,748
that he is
or was recently in Florence.

770
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:25,278
- Really?
- <i>He's a very dangerous man, Inspector.</i>

771
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:28,591
He's killed 1 <i>4</i> people
that we know of.

772
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:30,910
- I really have to go, Miss...
- <i>Starling.</i>

773
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,592
<i>Just another minute.</i>

774
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:35,478
<i>- You sure you've never heard of him?</i>
- No, I haven't.

775
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:37,391
Because I'm confused.

776
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:41,712
Someone there has been accessing
our private VICAP files on Dr Lecter...

777
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:44,678
with some regularity
on your computer.

778
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:48,514
Everybody uses
everybody's computer here.

779
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:51,398
Maybe one of the detectives
on <i>II Mostro...</i>

780
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:53,357
was looking at
profiles of killers...

781
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,795
I'm speaking about the computer
at your home, sir.

782
01:06:57,320 --> 01:07:00,630
<i>You're trying to catch him yourself,</i>
<i>aren't you? For the reward.</i>

783
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:03,188
I cannot warn you
strongly enough against that.

784
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:06,033
He killed three policemen
down in Memphis while in custody...

785
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:09,669
<i>tearing the face off one of them,</i>
<i>and he will kill you too.</i>

786
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:46,271
<i>- I want him out of Tuscany fast.</i>
- Believe me...

787
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:49,193
he'll be gone
from the face of the earth fast.

788
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:50,793
Feet-first.

789
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:13,190
<i>Because of his avarice and his betrayal</i>
<i>of the emperor's trust...</i>

790
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:17,353
<i>Pier della Vigna was disgraced,</i>
<i>blinded and imprisoned.</i>

791
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:22,798
<i>Dante's pilgrim finds Pier della Vigna</i>
<i>on the seventh level of the Inferno...</i>

792
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:26,190
<i>and, likeJudas Iscariot,</i>
<i>he died by hanging.</i>

793
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:28,999
So judas and Pier della Vigna
are linked in Dante...

794
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:31,310
by the avarice
he saw in them.

795
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:35,552
In fact, avarice and hanging
are linked in the medieval mind.

796
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:38,871
This is the earliest known
depiction of the Crucifixion...

797
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:43,078
carved on an ivory box in Gaul
about A.D. <i>4</i>00.

798
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:47,790
It includes the death
by hanging of judas...

799
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,711
his face upturned
to the branch that suspends him.

800
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:52,633
Here he is again on the doors
of the Benevento Cathedral...

801
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:56,429
this time
with his bowels falling out.

802
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:06,477
<i>It wasn't easy, but I got this number</i>
<i>without tellin'them why...</i>

803
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:08,835
- Sorry.
- Not at all. Welcome.

804
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:12,117
- Please join us.
- Thank you.

805
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:14,998
On this plate from the
15th-century edition of the <i>Inferno...</i>

806
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:18,436
Pier della Vigna's body
hangs from a bleeding tree.

807
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:21,318
I will not belabour the obvious
parallel with judas Iscariot...

808
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:24,198
but Dante Alighieri
needed no drawn illustration.

809
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:28,671
It was his genius to make
Pier della Vigna, now in hell...

810
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:31,558
speak in strained hisses
and coughing sibilants...

811
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:34,393
as though
he is hanging still.

812
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:00,310
Avarice, hanging...

813
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:01,913
self-destruction.

814
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:08,236
"I make my own home...

815
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:11,111
be my gallows."

816
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:15,557
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,
for your kind attention.

817
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:33,872
I'm not a scholar,
but I think you've got the job.

818
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:35,154
Thank you.

819
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:38,038
- May I buy you a drink?
- How kind of you. I'd like that.

820
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:40,918
I'll be a minute
gathering my things.

821
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,911
Take your time.

822
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:56,113
Allegra, I'll be home
just a little later than I said.

823
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:58,111
I'm taking Dr Fell out
for a drink.

824
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,636
I can see the people
coming out now.

825
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:08,360
Yes. Bye, honey. My wife.

826
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:09,998
Of course.

827
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,880
I should have shown them
this one.

828
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:18,589
I can't imagine how I missed it.
Remember? I told you about it.

829
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:21,194
It's a rendering
I found in the Capponi Library.

830
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:23,919
Can you make it out?

831
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,639
There's a name there...

832
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:28,711
the one I told you about.

833
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,236
It's your ancestor,
<i>Commendatore...</i>

834
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:45,788
hanging beneath
these very windows.

835
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:47,677
Francesco de' Pazzi.

836
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:52,316
On a related subject,
I must confess to you...

837
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,868
I'm giving very serious thought...

838
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:02,631
to eating your wife.

839
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:37,478
If you tell me what I need to know,
<i>Commendatore...</i>

840
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:40,028
it might be convenient for me
to leave Florence without my meal.

841
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:43,556
So I'll ask you the questions,
and then we'll see. All right?

842
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:44,914
Okay?

843
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,194
So.

844
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:03,109
Now, is it Mason Verger
you sold me to?

845
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:06,719
No, no.

846
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,916
Blink twice for yes,
once for no.

847
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,434
Was it Mason Verger
you sold me to?

848
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,831
Yes, good. Thank you.

849
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:17,718
And are his men
waiting for me outside?

850
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:21,391
Was that a single blink?

851
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,277
You're confused.

852
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:27,319
Please don't be confused, because I may
have to fillet Signora Pazzi after all.

853
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:32,715
Have you told anyone
in the <i>questura</i> about me?

854
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:36,031
No, I thought not.

855
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:39,592
Have you told Allegra?

856
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,911
No? Are you sure?

857
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:47,472
I believe you.

858
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:52,235
Okey-dokey, here we go.

859
01:13:58,520 --> 01:13:59,714
Okay.

860
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:02,753
Your heart is really palpitating.

861
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:05,638
Oh, it's not your heart.

862
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,556
Shall I answer it?

863
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:14,360
<i>I've gone above you.</i>
<i>I've spoken to your section chief.</i>

864
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:17,079
Someday you'll thank me.
Or you won't. I don't care.

865
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:19,390
You'll be alive.

866
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:21,277
Inspector Pazzi?

867
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:24,395
<i>Is this Clarice?</i>

868
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,835
Hello, Clarice.

869
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:29,717
I'm afraid I have
bad news for you.

870
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:32,792
- Is he dead?
- <i>Did you get my note?</i>

871
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:35,440
<i>I hope you like the skin cream.</i>
<i>I had it specially made for you.</i>

872
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,351
Is he dead, Dr Lecter?

873
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:41,399
<i>I would love nothing more in this world</i>
<i>than to be able to chat with you.</i>

874
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:44,517
Unfortunately, you've caught me
at an awkward moment.

875
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,750
Please forgive me.

876
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:48,512
See you around.

877
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:52,591
An old friend.

878
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:57,953
Okay, hold on.

879
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:00,999
Here we go.

880
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,959
I'll go around back!
Kill him if you have to!

881
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:40,917
What's it to be?

882
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,070
Bowels in or bowels out...

883
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:45,071
like judas?

884
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:46,912
Are you confused?

885
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,719
I'll decide for you,
if you'll permit me.

886
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:01,508
Good evening.

887
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:08,554
Cordell...

888
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,471
to you...

889
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:13,791
does that look
like a wave goodbye...

890
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:17,349
or hello?

891
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:03,717
So, what do you think?

892
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:08,669
Does Lecter want to fuck her
or kill her or eat her or what?

893
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:11,228
Probably all three.

894
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:13,834
Though I wouldn't want
to predict in what order.

895
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,828
Here's what I think.

896
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:21,833
No matter how Barney
might want to romanticize it...

897
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:25,629
and make it
<i>Beauty and the Beast...</i>

898
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:28,757
Lecter's object, as I know
from personal experience...

899
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:30,956
has always been...

900
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:33,076
degradation...

901
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:35,310
and suffering.

902
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:39,951
Get this damn thing off me.
I can't breathe in this thing.

903
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:45,477
He comes in the guise
of a mentor...

904
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:48,791
as he did with me and her.

905
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:52,668
But it's distress that excites him.

906
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:54,591
To draw him...

907
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:58,189
she needs to be distressed.

908
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:05,078
To make her attractive to him,
let him see her distressed.

909
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:09,588
Let the damage he sees...

910
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:12,558
suggest the damage
he could do.

911
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:25,115
When the fox hears the rabbit scream,
he comes a-runnin'.

912
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:28,751
But not to help.

913
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:30,671
I don't understand.

914
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:32,796
<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>to understand, Paul.</i>

915
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:36,555
<i>All you have to understand</i>
<i>is what it's worth to you.</i>

916
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:39,438
No, no, I don't understand
why she didn't turn this over.

917
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:41,397
I mean, she's such
a straight arrow.

918
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:44,711
She didn't turn it over
because she didn't receive it.

919
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,756
She didn't receive it
because it was never sent.

920
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:49,149
It was never sent because
Lecter didn't write it.

921
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:51,708
He didn't write it
because I did.

922
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:58,631
<i>So, what do you think?</i>

923
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:01,996
You'd have been better off if
you'd never got her out of trouble.

924
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:05,914
<i>Oh, woulda, shoulda, coulda. I meant,</i>
<i>what do you think about the money?</i>

925
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,115
Five.

926
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:12,392
Let's just toss it off, like "five."

927
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:15,313
Let's say it
with the respect it deserves.

928
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:18,233
Five hundred thousand dollars.

929
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:20,117
<i>That's better, but not much.</i>

930
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:22,509
- Now, will it work?
- <i>It'll work.</i>

931
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:24,636
It won't be pretty.

932
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:26,631
<i>What ever is?</i>

933
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:32,030
Cocksucker.

934
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:34,953
Never seen this before
in my life.

935
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:39,238
Then how do you account for its being
found in your office, your basement?

936
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:42,118
How do you want me to answer that,
Mr Krendler?

937
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,998
What possible reason
might I have to withhold it?

938
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:48,197
Perhaps because of the nature
of its content.

939
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:51,113
Reads to me like a love letter.

940
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:54,158
- Has it been tested for prints?
- No prints on it. None on the last one.

941
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:56,037
Handwriting analysis?

942
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:59,590
"Did you ever think, Clarice, why
the philistines don't understand you?

943
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:01,875
It's because you're the answer
to Samson's riddle.

944
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:03,951
You are the honey in the lion."

945
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:05,473
Sounds like him to me.

946
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:09,678
- Do you mean, like a homosexual?
- Like a nut with a crush.

947
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,034
Director Noonan,
I need to say something...

948
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:13,509
Agent Starling, I am placing you
on administrative leave...

949
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:17,593
till document analysis tells me
unequivocally a mistake's been made.

950
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:20,752
In the meantime, you remain eligible
for insurance and medical benefits.

951
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:23,798
Surrender your weapons and
your identification to Agent Pearsall.

952
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:38,839
I want to say something.
I think I'm entitled.

953
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:40,592
Go ahead.

954
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:43,990
I think Mr Mason Verger is
trying to capture Dr Lecter...

955
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:45,991
for the purposes
of personal revenge.

956
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:48,469
I think Mr Krendler
is in collusion with him...

957
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:51,358
and wants the FBI's efforts against
Dr Lecter to work for Mr Verger.

958
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:54,193
I think Mr Krendler
is being paid to do this.

959
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:57,829
- Lucky you're not sworn here today.
- Swear me! You swear too!

960
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:00,559
Clarice,
if the evidence is lacking...

961
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:03,154
you'll be entitled to full reinstatement
without prejudice...

962
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:07,472
if you don't do or say
anything in the meantime...

963
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:09,994
that would make that impossible.

964
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:13,352
<i>Relieved of field duty pending</i>
<i>an internal investigation...</i>

965
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:16,273
<i>Special Agent Clarice Starling,</i>
<i>a ten-year veteran on the Bureau...</i>

966
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:18,316
<i>began her career</i>
<i>with an assignment...</i>

967
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,391
<i>to interview lethal madman</i>
<i>Hannibal Lecter.</i>

968
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:24,155
<i>Earlier, we heard comments from Justice</i>
<i>Department spokesman Paul Krendler.</i>

969
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:28,357
<i>Can you comment on theJustice</i>
<i>Department's decision this morning?</i>

970
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:32,353
<i>The FBI and theJustice Department are</i>
<i>looking very carefully into the charges.</i>

971
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:34,670
<i>And, yes, they are extremely serious.</i>

972
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:36,193
<i>I'd like to add</i>
<i>a personal note, though.</i>

973
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:40,717
<i>- Starling's one of our best agents.</i>
- No, no, no, stay.

974
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:44,634
<i>I would be very surprised if these</i>
<i>accusations turn out to be true.</i>

975
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:48,030
<i>Is theJustice Department and FBI</i>
<i>united in this decision?</i>

976
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:50,714
<i>It's much too soon to condemn her...</i>

977
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:35,758
Good boy.

978
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:13,595
<i>I think she's nice.</i>

979
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:16,433
<i>She's always been nice to me.</i>
<i>Polite.</i>

980
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:17,953
<i>Don't you think?</i>

981
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:20,838
<i>Do you know what</i>
<i>a roller pigeon is, Barney?</i>

982
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:23,150
<i>Roller pigeons</i>
<i>climb high and fast...</i>

983
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:26,198
<i>then roll over and fall</i>
<i>Just as fast towards the Earth.</i>

984
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:29,477
<i>There are shallow rollers</i>
<i>and there are deep rollers...</i>

985
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:32,836
<i>but you can't breed two deep rollers,</i>
<i>or their young, their offspring...</i>

986
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:36,196
<i>will roll all the way down,</i>
<i>hit and die.</i>

987
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:40,114
<i>Agent Starling is a deep roller.</i>

988
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:42,998
<i>Let's hope</i>
<i>one of her parents was not.</i>

989
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:11,869
<i>The power in that battery</i>
<i>is low, Clarice.</i>

990
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:14,554
<i>I would've changed it,</i>
<i>but I didn't want to wake you.</i>

991
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:18,792
<i>Use the one in the charger. Hopefully,</i>
<i>the light on it is green by now.</i>

992
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:21,474
<i>Because this is gonna be a long call</i>
<i>and I can't let you off...</i>

993
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:23,869
<i>because even though</i>
<i>you've been stripped of your duties...</i>

994
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:27,111
<i>I know you won't abandon them...</i>
<i>you'll try to put on a trace.</i>

995
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:30,670
<i>So we'll disconnect long enough for you</i>
<i>to exchange the battery in the phone...</i>

996
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:32,671
<i>for the one in the charger.</i>

997
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:35,638
<i>Shall we say, three seconds?</i>

998
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:37,199
<i>- Are you ready?</i>
- Yes.

999
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:38,190
<i>Go.</i>

1000
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:45,317
- <i>Very good.</i>
- Thank you.

1001
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:48,198
<i>Remember, Clarice, if you get caught</i>
<i>with a concealed, unlicensed firearm...</i>

1002
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:50,999
<i>in the District of Columbia,</i>
<i>the penalty is very stiff.</i>

1003
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:54,516
<i>But bring the guns if you have to.</i>
<i>Now get in your car.</i>

1004
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,150
<i>The reason we're doing it</i>
<i>like this, Clarice...</i>

1005
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:36,119
<i>is because I like to watch you</i>
<i>as we speak, with your eyes open.</i>

1006
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:40,750
<i>No, it does not excite me.</i>
<i>It pleases me.</i>

1007
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:43,149
<i>You have very shapely feet.</i>

1008
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:48,668
<i>Where are we now?</i>
<i>Call it out.</i>

1009
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:50,478
Massachusetts Avenue.

1010
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:52,357
<i>Take it.</i>

1011
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:56,069
<i>I thought, to begin with,</i>
<i>you might tell me how you're feeling.</i>

1012
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:57,070
About what?

1013
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:59,913
<i>The masters you serve</i>
<i>and how they've treated you.</i>

1014
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,594
<i>Your career, such as it is.</i>

1015
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:04,477
<i>Your life, Clarice.</i>

1016
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:06,437
I thought we might
talk about yours.

1017
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:09,398
<i>- What's the next cross street?</i>
- Capitol Street.

1018
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:13,553
<i>In two blocks, make a left</i>
<i>into Union Station. Park.</i>

1019
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:17,109
<i>My life? What is there</i>
<i>to say about mine?</i>

1020
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:20,158
I have been in a state of hibernation
for some time...

1021
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:22,231
<i>a little inactive.</i>

1022
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:25,471
<i>But now I'm back home</i>
<i>and I'm very happy...</i>

1023
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:27,198
<i>and very healthy.</i>

1024
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:31,478
<i>- You. It's you I'm worried about.</i>
- I'm fine.

1025
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:34,233
<i>No, you're certainly</i>
<i>not fine, Clarice.</i>

1026
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:36,914
<i>You fell in love with the Bureau,</i>
<i>the institution...</i>

1027
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:40,231
<i>only to discover, after giving it</i>
<i>everything you've got...</i>

1028
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:42,311
that it does not
love you back...

1029
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:44,311
that, in fact, it resents you.

1030
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:47,233
It resents you more than the husband
and children you gave up to it.

1031
01:31:47,320 --> 01:31:51,598
<i>Why is that, do you think?</i>
<i>Why are you so resented?</i>

1032
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:54,035
- Tell me.
- Tell you?

1033
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:55,678
God bless you.

1034
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:57,557
Well, isn't it clear?

1035
01:31:59,240 --> 01:32:02,516
You serve the idea
of order, Clarice.

1036
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:03,919
<i>They don't.</i>

1037
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:07,436
<i>You believe in the oath you took.</i>
<i>They don't.</i>

1038
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:11,718
<i>You feel it is your duty</i>
<i>to protect the sheep. They don't.</i>

1039
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:13,836
<i>They don't like you</i>
<i>because you're not like them.</i>

1040
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:16,036
<i>They hate you and envy you.</i>

1041
01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:19,715
<i>They are weak, unruly</i>
<i>and believe in nothing.</i>

1042
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:22,234
Mason Verger wants to kill you,
Dr Lecter.

1043
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:24,959
Turn yourself in to me,
and I promise no one will hurt you.

1044
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:28,430
<i>Will you stay with me in my prison cell</i>
<i>and hold my hand, Clarice?</i>

1045
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:30,750
<i>We could have some fun.</i>

1046
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:34,150
<i>No, Mason Verger does not want to kill</i>
<i>me any more than I want to kill him.</i>

1047
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:37,994
<i>Hejust wants to see me suffer</i>
<i>in some unimaginable way.</i>

1048
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:40,116
<i>He is rather twisted,</i>
<i>you know.</i>

1049
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:42,555
Have you had the pleasure
of meeting him?

1050
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:44,756
Face-to-face, so to speak?

1051
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:46,671
Yes.

1052
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:49,752
<i>- Attractive, isn't he?</i>
- Dr Lecter?

1053
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:55,951
<i>Okay, back to you.</i>

1054
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:58,190
I want to know what it is
you think you will do...

1055
01:32:58,280 --> 01:33:01,477
now that everything you've ever cared
about has been taken away from you.

1056
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:03,869
I don't know, Dr Lecter.

1057
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:06,679
<i>Clarice, do you think you'll work</i>
<i>as a chambermaid...</i>

1058
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:09,399
<i>at a motel on Route 66...</i>

1059
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:12,074
<i>Just like your mommy?</i>

1060
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:22,951
<i>What are you thinking now?</i>

1061
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:26,919
Are you paying attention to me,
ex-Special Agent Starling?

1062
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:30,917
<i>Are you, by any chance,</i>
<i>trying to trace my whereabouts?</i>

1063
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:38,110
- I'm being followed, Dr Lecter.
- <i>I know. I've seen them.</i>

1064
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:40,953
<i>And now you're in</i>
<i>a real dilemma, aren't you?</i>

1065
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:44,715
<i>Do you continue to try to find me,</i>
<i>knowing that you are leading them to me?</i>

1066
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:48,270
<i>Do you have so much faith in your</i>
<i>abilities that you honestly believe...</i>

1067
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:52,035
<i>you can somehow simultaneously</i>
<i>arrest me and them?</i>

1068
01:33:52,120 --> 01:33:55,908
<i>It could get very messy, Clarice,</i>
<i>like the fish market.</i>

1069
01:33:57,560 --> 01:34:00,120
- <i>What if I did it for you?</i>
- Did what?

1070
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:03,590
<i>Harmed them, Clarice,</i>
<i>the ones who have harmed you.</i>

1071
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:06,831
<i>What if I made them</i>
<i>scream apologies?</i>

1072
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:08,831
<i>No, I shouldn't even say it...</i>

1073
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:12,151
<i>because you'll feel, with your</i>
<i>perfect grasp of right and wrong...</i>

1074
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:14,390
<i>that you were somehow</i> accompli.

1075
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:17,073
Don't help me.

1076
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:20,431
No, of course not.
Forget I said it.

1077
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:27,873
<i>Clarice, you were very,</i>
<i>very warm.</i>

1078
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:29,871
<i>You were so close.</i>

1079
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:36,718
<i>And now you're getting</i>
<i>colder again.</i>

1080
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,916
<i>Yeah, warmer again.</i>

1081
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:42,993
<i>Well, I think I've been generous</i>
<i>enough with you and the clues.</i>

1082
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:46,436
<i>- You're on your own now, Clarice.</i>
- Dr Lecter.

1083
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:57,959
<i>Hope you like them, Clarice.</i>
<i>Ta-ta.</i>

1084
01:35:26,640 --> 01:35:28,153
Go.

1085
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,831
Get out of the way!

1086
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:59,679
I know the first thing a hysteric
says is, "I am not a hysteric"...

1087
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:02,911
but I am not a hysteric.
I am calm.

1088
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,753
I'll ask you one time.
Think before you answer.

1089
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:09,793
Think about every good thing
you ever did.

1090
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:11,677
Think about what you swore.

1091
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:14,911
Two men in a van,
a third driving, another man down.

1092
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,434
They put him in the back.
I think it was Lecter.

1093
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:20,751
I gave you a licence, and I'm reporting
it to you again in front of witnesses.

1094
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:24,278
All right.

1095
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:27,271
I'll go with it as a kidnapping.

1096
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:29,911
I'll send someone
with the local authorities...

1097
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,195
if they'll let us on the property
without a warrant.

1098
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:36,432
- I should go. You could deputize me.
- No. You're not going.

1099
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:39,080
You're going home,
where you'll wait for me to call...

1100
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:42,709
and tell you what,
if anything, we've found.

1101
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:47,111
Thank Mr Verger for letting us look
around. Sorry if we inconvenienced him.

1102
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:49,191
He's always happy to see you.

1103
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:00,356
Phone.

1104
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:02,908
<i>What number, please?</i>

1105
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,319
Carlo.

1106
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:13,313
Give me one.

1107
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:20,075
- <i>How is he?</i>
- Sleeping.

1108
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:22,799
Bring him home.

1109
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:48,230
<i>You've reached Clarice Starling.</i>
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

1110
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:49,799
<i>Pick up, Starling.</i>

1111
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:51,757
<i>There was nothing out there.</i>

1112
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:54,149
<i>I'm gonna say it again,</i>
<i>in case you didn't hear me.</i>

1113
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:57,994
<i>You are not a law officer while</i>
<i>you're on suspension. You'reJoe Blow.</i>

1114
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:01,998
<i>Hope for your sake</i>
<i>you're in the bathroom.</i>

1115
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:41,118
<i>Hylochoerus...</i>

1116
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:44,237
<i>meinertzhageni.</i>

1117
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:48,233
Ring any bells from
high school biology, Doctor?

1118
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:51,111
No?

1119
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:54,636
Well, I could list
its most conspicuous features...

1120
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:57,359
if that would help
jog the memory.

1121
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:00,878
Three pairs of incisors...

1122
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:05,351
one pair of elongated canines...

1123
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:09,997
three pairs of molars...

1124
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:12,514
four pairs of premolars...

1125
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:14,795
upper and lower...

1126
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:19,590
for a total of <i>44</i> teeth.

1127
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:28,876
The meal will begin with
an hors d'oeuvres tartare...

1128
01:39:30,280 --> 01:39:32,874
your feet.

1129
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:34,871
The main course...
the rest of you...

1130
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:38,475
won't be served
until seven hours later.

1131
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:40,710
But during that time...

1132
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:45,032
you'll be able to enjoy the effects
of the consumed appetizer...

1133
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:48,396
with a full-bodied saline drip.

1134
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:53,477
I guess you wish now...

1135
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:56,028
you'd fed the rest of me
to the dogs.

1136
01:39:57,440 --> 01:39:59,396
No, Mason.

1137
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:02,428
No, I much prefer you
the way you are.

1138
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:04,913
So...

1139
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:08,357
dinner at 8:00.

1140
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:38,510
You will stay
for the evening's entertainment...

1141
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:40,272
won't you, Cordell?

1142
01:40:40,360 --> 01:40:42,828
If it's all right with you...

1143
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:45,559
I think I'd rather not.

1144
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:47,710
Rather not...

1145
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:50,473
or will not?

1146
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:53,199
Your little brother must smell
almost as badly as you do by now.

1147
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:22,070
Hold it!
Hands where I can see 'em!

1148
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:27,914
Quiet!

1149
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:35,714
What was that?

1150
01:43:35,800 --> 01:43:36,994
Cordell, quickly!

1151
01:43:37,080 --> 01:43:40,038
Get on your stomach.

1152
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:41,633
Good evening, Clarice.

1153
01:43:41,720 --> 01:43:44,632
- Just like old times.
- Shut up.

1154
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:48,550
- Can you walk?
- I can try.

1155
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:52,953
You look well.

1156
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:54,996
I'm gonna cut you loose.

1157
01:43:55,080 --> 01:43:58,152
If you touch me,
I'll shoot you.

1158
01:43:58,240 --> 01:44:01,312
- Understood.
- Do right and you'll live through this.

1159
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:04,233
Spoken like a true Protestant.
Better hurry.

1160
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:06,629
Things might go faster
if you hand me the knife.

1161
01:44:06,720 --> 01:44:09,075
There was a third
in the loft.

1162
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:12,550
No, Clarice. Behind me.

1163
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:52,349
Cordell, shoot him!
Get the gun and shoot him!

1164
01:44:52,440 --> 01:44:54,749
- Go into the pen?
- Yes!

1165
01:44:54,840 --> 01:44:56,990
No. I'm staying out of this.

1166
01:44:57,080 --> 01:45:00,914
You're involved, is what you are,
in all of it. Now do it!

1167
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:01,989
- No.
- Yes!

1168
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:05,038
Hey, Cordell,
why don't you push him in?

1169
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:07,156
You can always say
it was me.

1170
01:46:49,200 --> 01:46:50,713
Mary, it's me.

1171
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:54,315
I decided to take off early.
I'll be at my lake house all weekend.

1172
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:56,994
I don't want any calls
fo<i>rw</i>arded either. Do you understand?

1173
01:46:57,080 --> 01:46:59,719
Whoever it is,
they can all wait. Okay?

1174
01:46:59,800 --> 01:47:03,509
Listen, it's <i>4</i>th of july,
for Christ's sake. Thank you.

1175
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:20,511
What the fuck?

1176
01:47:30,160 --> 01:47:32,151
Good. You brought the wine.

1177
01:48:51,080 --> 01:48:55,517
One time I bet a friend I could hold
a lit firecracker in my hand...

1178
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:57,272
longer than he could.

1179
01:48:57,360 --> 01:48:58,429
Can I guess?

1180
01:48:58,520 --> 01:49:02,274
You lost the bet, and he lost
a finger. Am I right?

1181
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:05,669
This won't hurt a bit.

1182
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:13,949
Are we expecting guests?

1183
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:48,992
<i>We've traced your call and units</i>
<i>will be there in about ten minutes.</i>

1184
01:49:49,080 --> 01:49:52,197
<i>If you can do it safely,</i>
<i>Just get out of the house.</i>

1185
01:49:52,280 --> 01:49:55,397
<i>Otherwise,</i>
<i>stay on the phone with me.</i>

1186
01:49:55,480 --> 01:49:56,833
<i>Ma'am?</i>

1187
01:49:56,920 --> 01:49:59,673
<i>Are you there? Ma'am?</i>

1188
01:50:15,240 --> 01:50:17,310
You need to make sure
they feel welcome.

1189
01:50:22,360 --> 01:50:25,875
- Are those shallots?
- And caper berries.

1190
01:50:28,760 --> 01:50:30,671
That butter smells wonderful.

1191
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:34,036
You feeling hungry, Paul?

1192
01:50:34,120 --> 01:50:35,951
Very.

1193
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,275
What's the main course?

1194
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:46,750
You should never ask.
It spoils the surprise.

1195
01:50:46,840 --> 01:50:51,470
Clarice, what are you doing up?
You should be resting. Get back to bed.

1196
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:53,516
I'm hungry.

1197
01:50:55,960 --> 01:50:58,633
- Hello, Paul.
- Paul, don't be rude.

1198
01:50:59,800 --> 01:51:02,678
Say, "Hello, Agent Starling."

1199
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:06,036
Hello, Agent Starling.

1200
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:09,711
I always wanted
to watch you eat.

1201
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:14,669
What have you got in your hand?
Something to bash me on the head with?

1202
01:51:15,480 --> 01:51:17,869
Put it on the table.

1203
01:51:17,960 --> 01:51:19,234
Good girl.

1204
01:51:19,320 --> 01:51:21,470
Hey. That's mine.

1205
01:51:21,560 --> 01:51:23,232
Now sit down.

1206
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:28,198
Hey, Clarice, love the dress.

1207
01:51:28,280 --> 01:51:30,271
It's beautiful.

1208
01:51:30,360 --> 01:51:32,510
- What do you think, Paul?
- Nice.

1209
01:51:33,560 --> 01:51:35,312
Nice.

1210
01:51:43,160 --> 01:51:46,436
Why don't you say grace, Paul.

1211
01:51:46,520 --> 01:51:48,829
- Me?
- Yeah.

1212
01:51:48,920 --> 01:51:50,512
- Grace?
- Sure.

1213
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:53,277
Okay.

1214
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:54,918
Bow your head.

1215
01:51:57,240 --> 01:52:00,038
Father, we thank Thee
for Thy blessings...

1216
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:01,951
and dedicate them
to Thy mercy...

1217
01:52:02,040 --> 01:52:05,077
We are about to receive...

1218
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:06,752
Forgive us all...

1219
01:52:06,840 --> 01:52:08,831
even white trash
like Starling here...

1220
01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:11,878
and bring her
into my service, amen.

1221
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:17,958
I have to tell you, Paul, even the
Apostle Paul couldn't have done better.

1222
01:52:18,040 --> 01:52:20,031
He hated women too.

1223
01:52:20,120 --> 01:52:23,430
- May I have some wine, please?
- I don't think that's a good idea.

1224
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:25,112
Not with the morphine.

1225
01:52:25,200 --> 01:52:27,555
I think you should
eat some broth. Okay?

1226
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:32,430
By the way, that was a job offering
I worked into the blessing.

1227
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:34,431
I'm going to Congress,
you know.

1228
01:52:34,520 --> 01:52:36,158
Are you?

1229
01:52:36,240 --> 01:52:38,913
Come around campaign headquarters.

1230
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:42,356
You could be an office girl.
Can you type and file?

1231
01:52:42,440 --> 01:52:45,989
Can you take dictation?
Take this down.

1232
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:49,834
"Washington is full
of cornpone, country pussy."

1233
01:52:52,600 --> 01:52:55,239
I took it down.
You said it already.

1234
01:52:55,320 --> 01:52:58,471
Paul, now you're being rude,
and I hate rude people.

1235
01:52:58,560 --> 01:53:01,677
Drink your broth
like a good boy. Come on. Sip.

1236
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:04,759
Good.

1237
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:10,348
It's not very good, buddy.

1238
01:53:10,440 --> 01:53:13,273
I admit I added something to yours.
Perhaps it's clashing with the cumin.

1239
01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:16,557
But I assure you,
the next course is to die for.

1240
01:53:28,160 --> 01:53:30,037
Come on, Clarice.

1241
01:53:30,120 --> 01:53:32,111
That's a good girl.

1242
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:33,713
Good.

1243
01:54:03,720 --> 01:54:04,755
Dr Lecter.

1244
01:54:04,840 --> 01:54:08,753
You see, the brain itself feels no pain,
Clarice, if that concerns you.

1245
01:54:08,840 --> 01:54:12,435
For example, Paul won't miss
this little piece here...

1246
01:54:12,520 --> 01:54:14,351
part of the prefrontal lobe...

1247
01:54:14,440 --> 01:54:17,398
which they say is
the seat of good manners.

1248
01:54:17,480 --> 01:54:21,029
Your profile at the border stations
has five features.

1249
01:54:21,120 --> 01:54:22,917
- I'll trade you.
- Trade?

1250
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:27,391
- Stop, and I'll tell you what they are.
- How does that word taste to you?

1251
01:54:27,480 --> 01:54:31,359
Cheap and metallic,
like sucking on a greasy coin?

1252
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:33,317
- Who's Clarice?
- Agent Starling, Paul.

1253
01:54:33,400 --> 01:54:36,710
If you can't keep up with the
conversation, try not to join in at all.

1254
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:38,791
Paul, I'm Starling.

1255
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:40,711
See...

1256
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:42,631
here...

1257
01:54:42,720 --> 01:54:46,429
right here's the sac
that contains the brain.

1258
01:54:48,680 --> 01:54:51,114
I would really like some wine.

1259
01:54:54,440 --> 01:54:56,749
- That smells great.
- Yes.

1260
01:54:56,840 --> 01:54:59,832
There.
Like to try a little piece?

1261
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:02,593
I would really like
some wine...

1262
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:06,197
It is good.

1263
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:10,589
All right. Just a little.

1264
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:12,910
Okay?

1265
01:55:29,640 --> 01:55:32,438
Given the chance, you would deny me
my life, wouldn't you?

1266
01:55:33,640 --> 01:55:35,278
Not your life.

1267
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:38,318
My freedom, just that.
You'd take that from me.

1268
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:41,631
And if you did, would they have
you back, do you think?

1269
01:55:41,720 --> 01:55:44,154
The FBI?

1270
01:55:44,240 --> 01:55:47,550
Those people you despise almost
as much as they despise you?

1271
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:50,677
Will they give you a medal,
Clarice, do you think?

1272
01:55:50,760 --> 01:55:53,957
Would you have it professionally framed
and hang it on your wall to look at...

1273
01:55:54,040 --> 01:55:58,272
and remind you of your courage
and incorruptibility?

1274
01:56:00,760 --> 01:56:04,070
All you would need for that,
Clarice, is a mirror.

1275
01:56:05,600 --> 01:56:09,912
I have plans for that smart mouth.
I'm never gonna hire you now.

1276
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:16,518
Remember what I said?

1277
01:56:16,600 --> 01:56:19,319
If you can't be polite
to our guests...

1278
01:56:19,400 --> 01:56:22,119
you have to sit
at the kiddies' table.

1279
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,150
Don't get up, Clarice.

1280
01:56:25,240 --> 01:56:28,835
Paul will help me clear
and make the coffee.

1281
01:56:30,760 --> 01:56:32,671
Just think about
what I said, Clarice.

1282
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:36,358
Coffee.

1283
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:15,235
I came halfway
around the world...

1284
01:57:15,320 --> 01:57:17,629
to watch you run, Clarice.

1285
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,911
Let me run, huh?

1286
01:57:40,280 --> 01:57:44,512
Tell me, Clarice,
would you ever say to me...

1287
01:57:44,600 --> 01:57:46,079
"Stop.

1288
01:57:46,160 --> 01:57:48,071
If you loved me, you'd stop"?

1289
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:51,910
Not in a thousand years.

1290
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:55,311
Not in a thousand years.

1291
01:58:00,760 --> 01:58:02,671
That's my girl.

1292
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:19,315
Now, that's really
interesting, Clarice...

1293
01:58:19,400 --> 01:58:21,311
and I'm really pressed for time.

1294
01:58:21,400 --> 01:58:24,119
So where's the key?

1295
01:58:25,040 --> 01:58:26,951
Where's the key?

1296
01:58:32,480 --> 01:58:33,959
Okay.

1297
01:58:38,680 --> 01:58:40,033
Above...

1298
01:58:40,120 --> 01:58:41,838
or below the wrist...

1299
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:43,478
Clarice?

1300
01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:53,558
This is really gonna hurt.

1301
01:59:40,280 --> 01:59:42,794
Show me your hands!

1302
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:45,314
Identify yourself!

1303
01:59:45,400 --> 01:59:47,152
I'm Clarice Starling!

1304
01:59:48,200 --> 01:59:50,111
FBI!

1305
02:00:46,760 --> 02:00:48,398
- Hi.
- Hi.

1306
02:00:48,480 --> 02:00:50,118
What's that?

1307
02:00:51,960 --> 02:00:53,951
That's caviar.

1308
02:00:54,040 --> 02:00:57,157
- What are those?
- These are figs.

1309
02:00:57,240 --> 02:00:59,231
And that?

1310
02:01:01,320 --> 02:01:02,878
This?

1311
02:01:04,200 --> 02:01:06,430
That I don't think
you would like.

1312
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:08,715
- It looks good.
- Oh, it is good.

1313
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:10,153
Can I have some?

1314
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:14,114
You're a very unusual boy,
aren't you?

1315
02:01:14,200 --> 02:01:17,510
- I couldn't eat what they gave me.
- Nor should you. It isn't even food...

1316
02:01:17,600 --> 02:01:21,149
as I understand the definition,
which is why I always bring my own.

1317
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:25,795
So, which would you like to try?

1318
02:01:30,120 --> 02:01:32,429
Well, I suppose it's all right.

1319
02:01:34,040 --> 02:01:38,716
After all, as your mother tells you,
and my mother certainly told me...

1320
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:41,189
"It is important,"
she always used to say...

1321
02:01:41,280 --> 02:01:44,033
"always to try new things."

1322
02:01:44,120 --> 02:01:45,473
Open up.

1323
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:53,314
<i>Ta-ta. "H."</i>
