1
00:00:39,008 --> 00:00:42,258
Sometimes Dr. Lecter and I
would talk...

2
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:44,299
when things got quiet enough...

3
00:00:44,383 --> 00:00:46,466
about the science courses
I was takin'.

4
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:50,466
Some kind of mail-order courses
in psychology, Nurse Barney?

5
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:51,966
No, sir.

6
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:54,924
I don't consider psychology
a science...

7
00:00:54,966 --> 00:00:57,549
and neither did Dr. Lecter.

8
00:01:00,258 --> 00:01:01,799
Now, Barney...

9
00:01:01,883 --> 00:01:04,424
while you were working
at the asylum...

10
00:01:04,508 --> 00:01:10,591
you observed Clarice Starling
and Hannibal Lecter interacting.

11
00:01:10,633 --> 00:01:12,341
Interacting?

12
00:01:12,424 --> 00:01:15,174
Talking to one another.

13
00:01:15,258 --> 00:01:18,091
Yes.
Yes, it seemed to me that they...

14
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:21,674
I can see you're eager to justify
your consulting fee...

15
00:01:21,758 --> 00:01:24,924
but why don't we start
with what you saw...

16
00:01:25,008 --> 00:01:27,091
not what you thought about
what you saw?

17
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:31,591
Cordell, don't be like that.
Barney can give us his opinion.

18
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:35,924
Barney, give us your opinion
of what you saw.

19
00:01:35,966 --> 00:01:38,383
What was it between them?

20
00:01:39,716 --> 00:01:43,924
Most of the time, Dr. Lecter
didn't respond at all to visitors.

21
00:01:43,966 --> 00:01:46,799
He'd just, for instance,
open his eyes long enough...

22
00:01:46,883 --> 00:01:50,049
to insult some academic
who was there to look over him.

23
00:01:51,591 --> 00:01:54,258
With Starling,
he answered her questions.

24
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,133
She interested him.
She intrigued him.

25
00:01:58,174 --> 00:02:01,674
He thought she was charming
and amusing.

26
00:02:02,591 --> 00:02:05,591
So Clarice Starling
and Hannibal Lecter...

27
00:02:05,633 --> 00:02:08,591
became friendly.

28
00:02:08,633 --> 00:02:12,591
Inside a kind of formal structure,
yes.

29
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:15,883
And he was fond of her.

30
00:02:18,216 --> 00:02:20,424
Yes.

31
00:02:20,508 --> 00:02:21,799
Thank you, Barney.

32
00:02:21,883 --> 00:02:23,924
Thank you very much
for your candor.

33
00:02:23,966 --> 00:02:27,258
And keep all those wonderful items...

34
00:02:27,341 --> 00:02:30,091
from your personal Lecter
treasure trove coming.

35
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:31,924
I've enjoyed them immensely.

36
00:02:32,008 --> 00:02:33,758
Mr. Verger.

37
00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:36,341
Oh, I almost forgot.

38
00:02:36,424 --> 00:02:39,091
I might be able to get a cookie down.
What do you say, Cordell?

39
00:02:39,174 --> 00:02:41,633
I think it would kill you.

40
00:02:50,258 --> 00:02:53,174
- How much?
- Two hundred and fifty.

41
00:02:53,258 --> 00:02:55,049
Thousand.

42
00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:01,008
Cut a check for $250,000.

43
00:04:54,966 --> 00:04:57,383
How can she sleep
at a time like this?

44
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:01,716
She's on a jump-out squad all night.
She's saving her strength.

45
00:05:31,466 --> 00:05:35,008
We got some guy named Bolton
from the DC Police.

46
00:05:36,341 --> 00:05:39,299
All right, everyone.
Pay attention. Here's the layout.

47
00:05:39,383 --> 00:05:41,966
Excuse me.
I'm Officer Bolton, DC Police.

48
00:05:42,049 --> 00:05:44,508
I can see that from your badge.
How do you do?

49
00:05:44,591 --> 00:05:46,091
I'm in charge here.

50
00:05:46,174 --> 00:05:48,424
Officer Bolton,
I'm Special Agent Starling.

51
00:05:48,466 --> 00:05:50,633
Just so we don't get off
on the wrong foot...

52
00:05:50,716 --> 00:05:52,924
let me explain
why we're all here.

53
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:57,091
I'm here because I know Evelda Drumgo.
I arrested her twice on RICO warrants.

54
00:05:57,174 --> 00:05:59,799
DEA and ATF, in addition
to backing me up...

55
00:05:59,883 --> 00:06:01,924
are here for the drugs
and the weapons.

56
00:06:01,966 --> 00:06:04,924
You're here because our mayor
wants to appear tough on drugs...

57
00:06:04,966 --> 00:06:07,258
especially after his own
cocaine conviction...

58
00:06:07,299 --> 00:06:10,049
and hopes he can accomplish that
by having you join us here today.

59
00:06:10,966 --> 00:06:13,174
You got a smart mouth, lady.

60
00:06:13,258 --> 00:06:16,716
If you wouldn't mind, I'd appreciate it
if you'd let me continue.

61
00:06:18,049 --> 00:06:20,091
All right, take a look.

62
00:06:20,133 --> 00:06:23,133
Fish market.
Back's on the water.

63
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,466
Across the street, ground floor,
is the meth lab.

64
00:06:25,549 --> 00:06:27,966
Evelda Drumgo's HIV positive.

65
00:06:28,049 --> 00:06:31,466
She will spit and bite if cornered,
so you should watch it.

66
00:06:31,508 --> 00:06:34,341
If you happen to be the one
who puts her in a patrol car...

67
00:06:34,424 --> 00:06:37,424
in front of the news cameras, Bolton,
you don't wanna push her head down.

68
00:06:37,466 --> 00:06:39,799
She'll likely have a needle
in her hair.

69
00:06:39,883 --> 00:06:42,674
We want to take her inside the building,
not out in the street.

70
00:06:42,758 --> 00:06:44,758
We can get closest with the van.

71
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:47,924
If it looks good, on my signal
we hit the front, DEA hits the back...

72
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:50,008
DCPD backin'them up.

73
00:06:50,091 --> 00:06:52,299
She'll have her watchers out
at least three blocks around.

74
00:06:53,258 --> 00:06:56,716
They've tipped her before in time, so
let's not make spectacles of ourselves.

75
00:07:08,758 --> 00:07:11,299
- Pretty busy today.
- I agree.

76
00:07:18,008 --> 00:07:19,883
Can I please get
a cup of coffee?

77
00:07:36,633 --> 00:07:38,924
- Did you see that?
- That's a roger.

78
00:07:47,591 --> 00:07:49,049
What's up, man?

79
00:07:59,049 --> 00:08:00,466
Goddamn it. It's her.

80
00:08:00,508 --> 00:08:02,758
With three guys.
They're all packin'.

81
00:08:02,841 --> 00:08:05,799
She's carryin' something.
She's got a baby.

82
00:08:05,841 --> 00:08:09,299
Hey, Brigham, it's too crowded.

83
00:08:09,341 --> 00:08:11,508
There are too many people.
I say we call it off.

84
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:12,799
What do you say?

85
00:08:12,883 --> 00:08:14,924
I agree.

86
00:08:15,008 --> 00:08:17,341
All units, stand down.

87
00:08:17,424 --> 00:08:19,633
- Whiskey team copies.
- Burke copy.

88
00:08:19,716 --> 00:08:21,633
This is Bolton.
Stay on target.

89
00:08:21,674 --> 00:08:24,424
I said all units stand down, Bolton,
right now.

90
00:08:24,466 --> 00:08:26,591
- It's too late. We're movin'in.
- Bolton, he said it's off.

91
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:28,424
Stand down now.

92
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,508
She's carrying a baby.
I repeat, she's carrying a baby.

93
00:08:30,591 --> 00:08:33,091
All units stand down.

94
00:08:33,133 --> 00:08:35,174
- Keep that gun down, Bolton.
- Damn, dude got a piece.

95
00:08:35,258 --> 00:08:37,008
- Light his ass up.
- It's a go!

96
00:08:37,091 --> 00:08:38,549
FBI! Down on the ground!

97
00:09:20,841 --> 00:09:22,591
Hold it!

98
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:24,633
Hold your fire!

99
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:27,966
Don't!

100
00:09:30,966 --> 00:09:33,466
Evelda, get out of the car!

101
00:09:35,258 --> 00:09:36,966
Starling, is that you?

102
00:09:39,091 --> 00:09:41,216
Step away from the car!

103
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:44,924
Show me your hands, Evelda.

104
00:09:46,633 --> 00:09:49,758
Please.
Show me your hands.

105
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,424
How've you been?

106
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,174
Don't do this.

107
00:09:53,258 --> 00:09:54,341
Do what?

108
00:10:26,591 --> 00:10:28,841
It's all right. It's okay.

109
00:10:28,924 --> 00:10:31,924
I know, I know. Baby, I know.

110
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:34,466
It's okay.

111
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,758
It's okay.

112
00:10:37,883 --> 00:10:39,883
It's okay.

113
00:10:58,633 --> 00:11:00,966
Friends, family and coworkers
gathered here this morning...

114
00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:05,174
at Arlington National Cemetery
to bury BATF AgentJohn Brigham...

115
00:11:05,258 --> 00:11:08,633
shot and killed in the line of duty
Friday. He was 40 years old.

116
00:11:08,674 --> 00:11:11,966
This ill-fated drug raid that claimed
his life and five others...

117
00:11:12,049 --> 00:11:14,633
is the latest in a seemingly
endless series of incidents...

118
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:16,508
beginning with Waco, Texas...

119
00:11:16,591 --> 00:11:19,966
in which theJustice Department
and the FBI have been questioned...

120
00:11:20,008 --> 00:11:22,924
about their use of firepower
rather than judgment.

121
00:11:22,966 --> 00:11:25,633
This time it was FBI
Special Agent Clarice Starling...

122
00:11:25,716 --> 00:11:27,466
heading up
the calamitous strike force.

123
00:11:27,549 --> 00:11:31,133
Agent Starling attained some measure
of celebrity ten years ago...

124
00:11:31,216 --> 00:11:34,591
when she was given information
by Dr. Hannibal "The Cannibal"Lecter...

125
00:11:34,633 --> 00:11:36,799
which led to the rescue
of Catherine Martin...

126
00:11:36,883 --> 00:11:39,299
daughter of the former US senator
from Tennessee.

127
00:11:39,341 --> 00:11:43,133
When she returns to work this week,
she won't be so celebrated.

128
00:11:43,216 --> 00:11:46,174
Attorney Telford Higgins, representing
one of the families of those slain...

129
00:11:46,258 --> 00:11:49,008
says he will file
a wrongful-death suit.

130
00:11:50,424 --> 00:11:52,216
Cordell!

131
00:12:04,049 --> 00:12:06,924
- Yes, sir.
- Get me theJustice Department.

132
00:12:14,716 --> 00:12:16,508
Agent Starling?

133
00:12:16,591 --> 00:12:20,341
This is John Eldridge from DEA.
Assistant Director Noonan, you know.

134
00:12:20,424 --> 00:12:23,591
Larkin Wayne from our Office
of Professional Responsibility.

135
00:12:23,633 --> 00:12:25,633
Bob Sneed, ATF.

136
00:12:25,716 --> 00:12:28,924
Benny Holcombe, assistant to the mayor.
And Paul Krendler.

137
00:12:28,966 --> 00:12:31,508
You know Paul.
Paul's come over from Justice...

138
00:12:31,591 --> 00:12:34,091
unofficially,
as a favor to us.

139
00:12:34,174 --> 00:12:36,716
In other words, he's here,
and he's not here.

140
00:12:39,674 --> 00:12:42,758
So I take it you've seen the coverage
in the papers and on television?

141
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:45,424
I have nothing to do with the news,
Mr. Krendler.

142
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:48,258
The woman had a baby in her arms.

143
00:12:48,341 --> 00:12:51,341
There are pictures. You could
see the problem, I would think.

144
00:12:51,424 --> 00:12:54,758
Not in her arms.
In a carrier across her chest.

145
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:56,966
In her arms she had a MAC-10.

146
00:12:57,049 --> 00:13:00,133
Look, we're here to help you,
Starling.

147
00:13:00,216 --> 00:13:03,216
It's gonna be a hell of a lot harder
to do with a combative attitude.

148
00:13:08,341 --> 00:13:10,883
Can I speak freely, Mr. Pearsall?

149
00:13:12,549 --> 00:13:15,633
Your agency called this office to get me
assigned to help you on this raid.

150
00:13:15,716 --> 00:13:17,674
I tried to do that.

151
00:13:17,758 --> 00:13:20,758
I clearly expressed my judgment
and was ignored.

152
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:23,924
And now a good agent and a friend
is dead.

153
00:13:27,049 --> 00:13:29,633
You shot and killed five people
out there, Agent Starling.

154
00:13:29,716 --> 00:13:31,924
Is that how you define
good judgment?

155
00:13:32,841 --> 00:13:34,966
This raid was an ugly mess.

156
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:38,174
I ended up in a position
where I had a choice of dying...

157
00:13:38,258 --> 00:13:40,258
or shooting a woman
carrying a child.

158
00:13:40,341 --> 00:13:42,591
I chose.

159
00:13:42,674 --> 00:13:44,341
I shot her.

160
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:47,716
I killed a mother
holding her child.

161
00:13:49,841 --> 00:13:52,341
And I regret it.
I resent myself for it.

162
00:13:52,424 --> 00:13:54,924
Gentlemen, I'm going
to call a halt to this meeting...

163
00:13:55,008 --> 00:13:57,424
and get back to you individually
by phone.

164
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,799
That was a waste of time.

165
00:14:05,549 --> 00:14:07,924
You have a secret admirer, Starling.

166
00:14:07,966 --> 00:14:11,549
He isn't much to look at,
but he does have friends in high places.

167
00:14:12,633 --> 00:14:15,466
Remember Mason Verger?

168
00:14:15,549 --> 00:14:18,133
Lecter's fourth victim.

169
00:14:18,216 --> 00:14:19,758
The rich one.

170
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:22,216
The only one that survived.

171
00:14:23,383 --> 00:14:26,008
He says he has some new information
on Lecter he'll only share with you.

172
00:14:26,091 --> 00:14:29,758
What do you mean, only share it with me?
You want it, seize it.

173
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:32,966
- I'd rather not.
- I wasn't speaking to you.

174
00:14:33,049 --> 00:14:35,549
When I speak to you, you'll know it
because I'll look at you.

175
00:14:37,299 --> 00:14:38,799
Why would we rather not?

176
00:14:38,883 --> 00:14:42,508
The last time he called was when we took
Lecter off the Ten Most Wanted List.

177
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:46,133
He was upset about that.
We said, "Hey, that's life."

178
00:14:46,174 --> 00:14:49,508
He said, "This is a Senate
Oversight Committee...

179
00:14:49,591 --> 00:14:51,174
to make your life miserable."

180
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:54,258
His family's political contributions
may not be enough...

181
00:14:54,341 --> 00:14:56,091
to buy a senator...

182
00:14:56,133 --> 00:14:58,133
but they are enough
to rent them from time to time.

183
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:02,591
There's no reason to go through that
if he really does have something new.

184
00:15:04,633 --> 00:15:08,633
It's a good deal for you, Starling.
You can't pretend it isn't.

185
00:15:09,924 --> 00:15:12,008
Get to go back
on a celebrated case.

186
00:15:12,091 --> 00:15:15,466
I'll take care of the media
for your Drumgo killing.

187
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:16,966
Everyone's gonna be happy.

188
00:15:17,008 --> 00:15:20,091
I'm not happy.

189
00:15:20,174 --> 00:15:22,966
Well, maybe you're incapable
of being happy.

190
00:15:24,008 --> 00:15:26,133
Mr. Krendler...

191
00:15:26,466 --> 00:15:29,758
out on the street, you know you might
take a bullet in the line of duty.

192
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:32,258
You accept it or you get out.

193
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:34,133
You live with it.

194
00:15:34,216 --> 00:15:36,924
What you don't expect or accept...

195
00:15:37,008 --> 00:15:39,674
is taking one in the back
in your boss's office...

196
00:15:39,758 --> 00:15:41,924
for doing your job
exactly as they've taught you.

197
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:43,674
That makes you unhappy.

198
00:15:43,758 --> 00:15:47,133
Of course you're right, Starling...

199
00:15:47,216 --> 00:15:49,258
but it doesn't change anything.

200
00:15:49,299 --> 00:15:52,508
It changes everything.
It changes me.

201
00:16:43,133 --> 00:16:46,299
Hi, I'm Cordell Doemling,
Mr. Verger's private physician.

202
00:16:46,383 --> 00:16:47,966
How do you do?

203
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:51,549
If you'd be so kind
as to park down at the end.

204
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:59,633
One's eyes adjust to the darkness.

205
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:18,299
Mr. Verger,
Agent Starling is here.

206
00:17:18,383 --> 00:17:21,174
Good morning, Mr. Verger.

207
00:17:21,258 --> 00:17:23,591
Was that a Mustang
I heard out there?

208
00:17:23,674 --> 00:17:24,799
Yes, it was.

209
00:17:24,883 --> 00:17:26,758
Five-liter?

210
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,466
Yes.

211
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:30,966
Fast.

212
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:33,591
Cordell, I think
you can leave us now.

213
00:17:33,674 --> 00:17:38,091
I thought I might stay.
Perhaps I could be useful.

214
00:17:38,133 --> 00:17:42,341
You could be useful
seeing about my lunch.

215
00:17:47,008 --> 00:17:50,466
I'll attach this microphone to your
clothing or pillow, if that's okay.

216
00:17:50,508 --> 00:17:52,633
By all means.

217
00:17:57,758 --> 00:17:59,716
Here, this should make it easier.

218
00:18:07,508 --> 00:18:10,008
You know, I thank God...

219
00:18:10,091 --> 00:18:11,924
for what happened.

220
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:14,174
It was my salvation.

221
00:18:15,508 --> 00:18:18,799
Have you accepted Jesus,
Agent Starling?

222
00:18:18,883 --> 00:18:21,424
- Do you have faith?
- I was raised Lutheran.

223
00:18:21,508 --> 00:18:24,091
That's not what I asked.

224
00:18:24,174 --> 00:18:27,591
This is Special Agent
Clarice Starling, 5143690...

225
00:18:27,633 --> 00:18:30,466
deposing Mason R. Verger on March 20,
sworn and attested.

226
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:33,508
I want to tell you about summer camp.
It was a wonderful childhood experience.

227
00:18:33,591 --> 00:18:36,591
- We can get to that later.
- We can get to it now.

228
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:39,591
You see, it all comes to bear.

229
00:18:39,633 --> 00:18:44,174
It was a Christian camp
my father founded...

230
00:18:44,258 --> 00:18:48,758
for poor, unfortunate, cast-off
little boys and girls...

231
00:18:48,841 --> 00:18:51,591
who would do anything
for a candy bar.

232
00:18:51,674 --> 00:18:54,258
Mr. Verger, I don't need to know
about the sex offenses.

233
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,758
It's all right.
I have immunity from the US Attorney.

234
00:18:57,841 --> 00:19:00,008
And I have immunity...

235
00:19:00,091 --> 00:19:03,049
from the risen Jesus.

236
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:05,674
And nobody beats the Riz.

237
00:19:06,383 --> 00:19:09,633
Had you ever seen Dr. Lecter before the
court assigned you to him for therapy?

238
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:11,133
What do you mean?

239
00:19:11,174 --> 00:19:12,966
Socially?

240
00:19:14,591 --> 00:19:17,758
It is what I mean, yes,
if you don't mind talking about it.

241
00:19:17,841 --> 00:19:19,841
No, not at all.
I'm not ashamed.

242
00:19:19,924 --> 00:19:23,174
- I didn't say you should be.
- No, we met conventionally...

243
00:19:23,258 --> 00:19:25,299
as doctor and patient.

244
00:19:25,383 --> 00:19:27,174
How did he end up at your house?

245
00:19:27,258 --> 00:19:30,174
I invited him, of course...

246
00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:34,008
to my pied-a-terre.

247
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:38,258
I came to the door
in my nicest come-hither outfit.

248
00:19:38,341 --> 00:19:40,341
I was concerned...

249
00:19:40,424 --> 00:19:43,758
that he'd be afraid of me.

250
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:47,216
But he didn't seem to be
afraid of me.

251
00:19:48,341 --> 00:19:50,466
That's almost funny now.

252
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:53,924
I showed him my toys...

253
00:19:53,966 --> 00:19:56,924
my noose setup,
among other things.

254
00:19:56,966 --> 00:20:01,258
It's where you sort of hang yourself,
but not really.

255
00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:03,424
It feels good while you...

256
00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:06,341
well, you know.

257
00:20:06,424 --> 00:20:07,758
Anyway...

258
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:12,341
- he said, "Mason..."
- Mason, would you like a popper?

259
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:16,799
And I said, "Would I? Oh, wow!"

260
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:19,591
Once that kicked in,
I was flying.

261
00:20:19,674 --> 00:20:23,591
He said,
"Mason, show me how you smile...

262
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:27,258
to gain the confidence
of a child."

263
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:30,299
When I smiled...

264
00:20:30,341 --> 00:20:33,299
he said,
"Oh, I see how you do it."

265
00:20:33,341 --> 00:20:38,091
The good doctor approached me
with a piece of broken mirror.

266
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:39,216
"Try this."

267
00:20:40,424 --> 00:20:42,216
Try peeling off your face...

268
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:45,758
And feeding it to the dogs.

269
00:20:55,049 --> 00:20:57,799
No, I can still see it.

270
00:20:57,883 --> 00:20:59,049
Try again.

271
00:21:00,216 --> 00:21:02,758
No, I'm afraid not.

272
00:21:02,841 --> 00:21:05,549
That's entertainment

273
00:21:07,716 --> 00:21:11,216
Well, it seemed like
a good idea at the time.

274
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:16,383
You indicated to me that you'd received
some kind of new information.

275
00:21:34,716 --> 00:21:37,091
Where did this come from?

276
00:21:37,133 --> 00:21:40,258
Buenos Aires.
I received it two weeks ago.

277
00:21:42,091 --> 00:21:44,674
Where's the package it came in?

278
00:21:44,758 --> 00:21:48,258
Good question. There was nothing
written on it of interest.

279
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:50,216
Did we throw it out?

280
00:21:51,341 --> 00:21:53,341
Yes, I'm afraid we did.

281
00:21:53,424 --> 00:21:56,174
Oh, dear.
You think it'll help?

282
00:21:56,258 --> 00:21:58,258
I hope so.

283
00:21:58,341 --> 00:22:00,341
I hope it'll help you catch him...

284
00:22:00,424 --> 00:22:05,299
to help cleanse the stigma
of your recent dishonor.

285
00:22:05,341 --> 00:22:07,008
Thank you. That's all I need.

286
00:22:07,091 --> 00:22:10,049
Did you find some rapport
with Dr. Lecter...

287
00:22:10,133 --> 00:22:12,674
in your talks at the asylum?

288
00:22:14,008 --> 00:22:16,841
I know I did
while I was peeling.

289
00:22:16,924 --> 00:22:19,841
We exchanged information
in a civil way.

290
00:22:19,924 --> 00:22:22,424
But always through the glass.

291
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,091
Yes.

292
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:37,674
- Isn't it funny?
- What's that?

293
00:22:38,383 --> 00:22:40,383
You can look at my face...

294
00:22:41,716 --> 00:22:45,049
but you shied when I said
the name of God.

295
00:23:11,341 --> 00:23:14,633
- Finding what you want?
- Are you sure this is all of it?

296
00:23:14,716 --> 00:23:16,758
That's all there is now.

297
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,258
There was more, but it's been picked
over little by little over the years.

298
00:23:21,758 --> 00:23:25,341
You know, this stuff s worth
a lot of money in certain circles.

299
00:23:27,008 --> 00:23:29,299
It's kind of like the cocaine
that disappears around here...

300
00:23:29,383 --> 00:23:30,758
little by little.

301
00:24:55,258 --> 00:24:57,091
Hey, Barney.

302
00:24:57,133 --> 00:24:59,508
Remember me?

303
00:24:59,591 --> 00:25:01,924
Would you agree for the record,
Agent Starling...

304
00:25:01,966 --> 00:25:03,799
that I've not been read my rights?

305
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:12,799
I have not Mirandized Barney.
He is unaware of his rights.

306
00:25:14,508 --> 00:25:16,924
So when you turned Dr. Lecter over
to the Tennessee police...

307
00:25:16,966 --> 00:25:21,091
They weren't civil to him.
They're all dead now.

308
00:25:21,133 --> 00:25:23,466
They only survived his company
three days.

309
00:25:23,549 --> 00:25:26,424
You survived him
six years at the asylum.

310
00:25:26,466 --> 00:25:29,633
How'd you do that?
It wasn't just being civil.

311
00:25:29,716 --> 00:25:32,466
Yes, it was.

312
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:35,799
Did you ever think, after he escaped,
he might come after you?

313
00:25:35,883 --> 00:25:36,924
No.

314
00:25:37,008 --> 00:25:39,299
He once told me that,
whenever feasible...

315
00:25:39,383 --> 00:25:41,466
he preferred to eat the rude.

316
00:25:41,549 --> 00:25:45,674
"Free-range rude," he called 'em.
What about you?

317
00:25:45,758 --> 00:25:49,091
You ever think he might come after you?
You ever think about him at all?

318
00:25:49,174 --> 00:25:52,591
At least 30 seconds of every day.
I can't help it.

319
00:25:52,633 --> 00:25:55,508
He's always with me,
like a bad habit.

320
00:25:56,841 --> 00:26:00,799
Do you know what happened to his stuff...
his books, papers, drawings?

321
00:26:00,841 --> 00:26:03,591
Everything got thrown away
when the place closed.

322
00:26:03,633 --> 00:26:05,841
Cutbacks.

323
00:26:05,924 --> 00:26:09,133
I just found out that Dr. Lecter's
signed copy of TheJoy of Cooking...

324
00:26:09,216 --> 00:26:12,758
sold to a private collector
for $16,000.

325
00:26:13,883 --> 00:26:16,091
It was probably a fake.

326
00:26:16,133 --> 00:26:20,133
The seller's affidavit of ownership
was signed "Karen Phlox."

327
00:26:20,216 --> 00:26:23,466
Do you know Karen Phlox?
You should.

328
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:27,466
She filled out your employment
application, but signed it "Barney."

329
00:26:28,424 --> 00:26:30,674
Same thing on your tax returns.

330
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:37,508
You want the book?
Maybe I can get it back.

331
00:26:37,591 --> 00:26:42,008
I want the x-ray of Lecter's arm
you broke in the attack on that nurse...

332
00:26:42,091 --> 00:26:44,216
and everything else you've got.

333
00:26:48,174 --> 00:26:51,924
We used to talk about
a lot of things at night...

334
00:26:51,966 --> 00:26:54,841
after the screamin'
finally died down.

335
00:26:58,508 --> 00:27:02,966
We talked about you sometimes.
You wanna know what he said?

336
00:27:03,049 --> 00:27:05,299
Go get the x-ray.

337
00:27:11,383 --> 00:27:13,383
I'm not a bad guy.

338
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:15,091
I didn't say you were.

339
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,633
Dr. Chilton was a bad guy.

340
00:27:17,716 --> 00:27:21,924
After your first visit, he started
taping your conversations with Lecter.

341
00:27:24,341 --> 00:27:26,924
These are valuable.

342
00:27:32,341 --> 00:27:34,424
Go on now.

343
00:27:34,466 --> 00:27:36,883
You've grieved long enough.

344
00:27:41,091 --> 00:27:43,258
And what'd he say?

345
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:45,299
What'd he say about me
late at night?

346
00:27:46,633 --> 00:27:49,508
He was talking about
inherited, hardwired behavior.

347
00:27:49,591 --> 00:27:52,549
He was using genetics
in the roller pigeons as an example.

348
00:27:52,633 --> 00:27:57,341
They fly up in the air, roll backwards
in a display, fallin' to the ground.

349
00:27:57,424 --> 00:28:00,841
There are shallow rollers,
and there are deep rollers.

350
00:28:00,924 --> 00:28:02,924
You can't breed two deep rollers...

351
00:28:03,008 --> 00:28:06,258
or their young, their offspring,
will roll all the way down...

352
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:08,591
hit and die.

353
00:28:08,674 --> 00:28:11,758
Agent Starling is a deep roller,
Barney.

354
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:15,424
Let us hope one of her parents
was not.

355
00:28:15,466 --> 00:28:19,174
Surely the odd confluence of events
hasn't escaped you, Clarice.

356
00:28:20,508 --> 00:28:23,424
Jack Crawford dangles you
in front of me...

357
00:28:23,466 --> 00:28:26,174
then I give you a bit of help.

358
00:28:26,258 --> 00:28:28,591
Do you think it's because
I like to look at you...

359
00:28:28,633 --> 00:28:32,591
and imagine how good
you would taste...

360
00:28:32,633 --> 00:28:34,966
Clarice?

361
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:37,633
I don't know. Is it?

362
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:42,341
I've been in this room
for eight years now, Clarice.

363
00:28:43,133 --> 00:28:46,174
I know they will never, ever
let me out while I'm alive.

364
00:28:47,508 --> 00:28:49,633
What I want is a view.

365
00:28:49,716 --> 00:28:53,633
I want a window where I
can see a tree or even water.

366
00:28:53,674 --> 00:28:56,633
I want to be in a federal institution
far away from Dr. Chilton.

367
00:29:12,103 --> 00:29:15,561
The Capponi correspondence
goes back to the 13th century.

368
00:29:15,644 --> 00:29:18,436
Dr. Fell might hold in his hand...

369
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:20,561
his non-Italian hand...

370
00:29:20,644 --> 00:29:23,103
a note from Dante Alighieri himself.

371
00:29:23,144 --> 00:29:26,019
But would he recognize it?
I think not.

372
00:29:27,186 --> 00:29:30,561
Gentlemen, you have examined him
in medieval Italian...

373
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:33,269
and I will not deny
that his language is admirable...

374
00:29:33,353 --> 00:29:35,561
for a straniero.

375
00:29:35,644 --> 00:29:38,894
But is he acquainted
with the personalities...

376
00:29:38,978 --> 00:29:40,728
of the pre-Renaissance Firenze?

377
00:29:41,644 --> 00:29:43,644
I think not.

378
00:29:43,728 --> 00:29:46,394
What if he came upon a note
in the Capponi library...

379
00:29:46,478 --> 00:29:49,061
say from Guido di Cavalcanti?

380
00:29:49,144 --> 00:29:52,936
Would he recognize that?
I think not.

381
00:29:53,019 --> 00:29:55,436
They're still arguing?

382
00:29:58,269 --> 00:30:00,936
Sogliato wants the job
for his nephew.

383
00:30:01,019 --> 00:30:05,561
But the scholars seem satisfied
with the temporary guy they appointed.

384
00:30:05,644 --> 00:30:08,228
If he's such an expert on Dante...

385
00:30:08,311 --> 00:30:11,103
let him lecture on Dante
to the Studiolo.

386
00:30:11,186 --> 00:30:14,061
- Let him face them if he can.
- I look forward to it.

387
00:30:16,186 --> 00:30:18,769
Very well. On the 14th.

388
00:30:35,811 --> 00:30:38,478
Dr. Fell?

389
00:30:38,561 --> 00:30:41,311
Chief Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi
of the questura.

390
00:30:41,478 --> 00:30:44,936
Commendatore,
how can I be of service?

391
00:30:45,019 --> 00:30:47,894
Sorry. I'm investigating
the disappearance...

392
00:30:47,936 --> 00:30:52,228
of your predecessor,
Signor di Bonaventura.

393
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:55,103
- I was wondering if...
- "Predecessor" implies I have the job.

394
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:58,894
Unfortunately, I don't.
Not yet, though I am hopeful.

395
00:30:58,978 --> 00:31:02,769
They are letting me look after
the library for a stipend.

396
00:31:04,561 --> 00:31:06,728
The officers who first checked...

397
00:31:06,769 --> 00:31:10,894
didn't find any sort of farewell
or suicide note.

398
00:31:10,936 --> 00:31:12,478
I was wondering if you...

399
00:31:12,561 --> 00:31:16,228
If I come across anything in the Capponi
library stuffed in a drawer or book...

400
00:31:16,269 --> 00:31:18,228
I'll call you at once.

401
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:22,186
Thank you.

402
00:31:23,186 --> 00:31:25,061
You've been reassigned.

403
00:31:28,144 --> 00:31:29,311
Pardon?

404
00:31:29,394 --> 00:31:32,811
You were on the II Mostro case,
I'm sure I read.

405
00:31:32,894 --> 00:31:35,228
- Yes, that's right.
- Now you're on this.

406
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:38,269
This is much less grand a case,
I would think.

407
00:31:38,353 --> 00:31:42,061
Well, if I thought of my work
in those terms...

408
00:31:42,103 --> 00:31:43,728
yes, I guess I'd agree.

409
00:31:44,478 --> 00:31:46,936
- A missing person.
- Sorry?

410
00:31:46,978 --> 00:31:50,936
Were you unfairly dismissed from
the grander case, or did you deserve it?

411
00:31:57,019 --> 00:31:59,728
Regarding this one, Dr. Fell...

412
00:31:59,811 --> 00:32:02,769
are the signore's personal effects
still at the Palazzo?

413
00:32:04,394 --> 00:32:07,936
Packed neatly in four cases
with an inventory.

414
00:32:08,019 --> 00:32:10,644
Alas, no note.

415
00:32:13,228 --> 00:32:17,644
I'll send someone over to pick them up.
Thank you for your help.

416
00:32:28,436 --> 00:32:30,228
Hey, thanks.

417
00:32:31,811 --> 00:32:33,894
How's it going? Any leads?

418
00:32:33,978 --> 00:32:37,103
Yeah, they're all leads.
They just don't lead to him.

419
00:32:41,811 --> 00:32:43,811
I don't know how you live
with this stuff.

420
00:32:43,894 --> 00:32:46,353
Oh, God.

421
00:32:46,436 --> 00:32:49,061
This is from the Guinness Book
of World Records congratulating me...

422
00:32:49,144 --> 00:32:52,769
on being the female FBI agent
who has shot and killed the most people.

423
00:33:16,311 --> 00:33:18,311
Would you excuse me, please?

424
00:33:20,311 --> 00:33:22,561
Sure.

425
00:33:47,894 --> 00:33:49,353
Dear Clarice...

426
00:33:50,853 --> 00:33:54,894
I've followed with enthusiasm the course
of your disgrace and public shaming.

427
00:33:54,978 --> 00:33:58,269
My own never bothered me
except for the inconvenience...

428
00:33:58,353 --> 00:34:00,228
of being incarcerated.

429
00:34:00,269 --> 00:34:02,603
But you may lack perspective.

430
00:34:03,936 --> 00:34:06,061
In our discussions
down in the dungeon...

431
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:09,978
it was apparent to me that your father,
the dead night watchman...

432
00:34:10,061 --> 00:34:12,603
figures largely
in your value system.

433
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:18,436
I think your success in putting an end
toJame Gumb's career as a couturier...

434
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:23,144
pleased you most because you could
imagine your father being pleased.

435
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:27,061
But now, alas,
you're in bad odor with the FBI.

436
00:34:27,103 --> 00:34:29,811
Do you imagine your daddy
being shamed by your disgrace?

437
00:34:29,894 --> 00:34:32,853
Do you see him
in his plain pine box...

438
00:34:32,936 --> 00:34:34,936
crushed by your failure...

439
00:34:35,019 --> 00:34:38,394
the sorry, petty end
of a promising career?

440
00:34:38,436 --> 00:34:41,978
What is worst
about this humiliation, Clarice?

441
00:34:42,061 --> 00:34:45,811
Is it how your failure will reflect
on your mommy and daddy?

442
00:34:47,269 --> 00:34:50,061
Is your worst fear that people
will now and forever believe...

443
00:34:50,103 --> 00:34:53,144
they were indeed just good old
trailer-camp...

444
00:34:53,228 --> 00:34:55,436
tornado-bait white trash...

445
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:57,853
and that perhaps you are too?

446
00:35:01,019 --> 00:35:04,144
By the way, I couldn't help noticing
on the FBI's rather dull web site...

447
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:09,103
that I've been hoisted from the Bureau's
archives of the common criminal...

448
00:35:09,186 --> 00:35:12,311
and elevated to the more prestigious
Ten Most Wanted List.

449
00:35:13,769 --> 00:35:17,978
Is this coincidence,
or are you back on the case?

450
00:35:18,061 --> 00:35:21,519
If so, goody goody, because
I need to come out of retirement...

451
00:35:21,603 --> 00:35:24,019
and return to public life.

452
00:35:27,311 --> 00:35:29,894
I imagine you sitting
in a dark basement room...

453
00:35:29,978 --> 00:35:33,019
bent over papers
and computer screens.

454
00:35:33,103 --> 00:35:35,144
Is that accurate?

455
00:35:35,228 --> 00:35:39,561
Please tell me truly,
Special Agent Starling.

456
00:35:39,603 --> 00:35:44,436
Regards, your old pal,
Hannibal Lecter, MD.

457
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:50,394
PS: Clearly this new assignment
is not your choice.

458
00:35:50,478 --> 00:35:52,478
Rather, I suppose,
it is part of the bargain.

459
00:35:52,561 --> 00:35:55,394
But you accepted it, Clarice.

460
00:35:55,436 --> 00:35:58,061
Yourjob is to craft my doom...

461
00:35:58,144 --> 00:36:00,936
so I'm not sure how well
I should wish you...

462
00:36:01,019 --> 00:36:03,478
but I'm sure
we'll have a lot of fun.

463
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:05,269
Ta-ta.

464
00:36:05,353 --> 00:36:07,436
"H."

465
00:36:13,603 --> 00:36:14,894
On the letter...

466
00:36:14,936 --> 00:36:17,769
there's one partial fingerprint here.

467
00:36:17,853 --> 00:36:20,936
- Not enough to hold up in court.
- I know it's him.

468
00:36:21,019 --> 00:36:23,269
Where he was when he wrote it
is what I need.

469
00:36:23,353 --> 00:36:25,728
Well, the paper isn't gonna help.

470
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:28,728
Yes, it's linen fibre,
yes, it's on the expensive side...

471
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:33,144
but it's not so rare that you won't find
it in a thousand stationery stores...

472
00:36:33,228 --> 00:36:35,269
throughout the world.

473
00:36:35,353 --> 00:36:39,061
It's the same with the ink,
and the same with the wax.

474
00:36:39,144 --> 00:36:41,478
And your Las Vegas postmark?

475
00:36:41,561 --> 00:36:45,394
You can check it out, but I'll bet you
it came from a remailing service.

476
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:47,769
Las Vegas would be
the last place he'd be.

477
00:36:47,853 --> 00:36:50,853
It'd be an assault
on his sense of taste.

478
00:36:57,478 --> 00:37:01,436
Don't you feel eyes
moving over your body, Clarice?

479
00:37:01,478 --> 00:37:03,186
I hardly see how you couldn't.

480
00:37:04,103 --> 00:37:07,353
And don't your eyes move
over the things you want?

481
00:37:08,686 --> 00:37:10,644
All right, then. Tell me how.

482
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,061
No.

483
00:37:12,103 --> 00:37:14,269
It's your turn to tell me, Clarice.

484
00:37:14,353 --> 00:37:18,728
You don't have any more vacations
to sell on Anthrax Island.

485
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,894
Quid pro quo, Clarice.

486
00:37:20,978 --> 00:37:23,811
I tell you things,
you tell me things.

487
00:37:23,894 --> 00:37:27,269
Not about this case.
About yourself.

488
00:37:27,353 --> 00:37:28,978
Quid pro quo.

489
00:37:29,061 --> 00:37:31,936
Yes or no, Clarice?

490
00:37:43,311 --> 00:37:45,228
Hand cream.

491
00:37:47,103 --> 00:37:49,519
Raw ambergris base.

492
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:53,269
Tennessee lavender.

493
00:37:54,311 --> 00:37:56,728
Trace of something else.

494
00:37:58,353 --> 00:37:59,561
Fleece.

495
00:38:00,561 --> 00:38:02,436
Lovely.

496
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:06,394
- What's ambergris?
- Ambergris is a whale product.

497
00:38:06,478 --> 00:38:09,311
Alas, much as we'd like to,
we can't import it.

498
00:38:09,394 --> 00:38:12,228
Endangered Species Act.

499
00:38:12,269 --> 00:38:14,603
- Where isn't it illegal?
- Japan, of course.

500
00:38:14,686 --> 00:38:16,811
Couple of places in Europe.

501
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:19,936
You'd almost certainly find it
somewhere in Paris...

502
00:38:20,019 --> 00:38:22,436
Rome, Amsterdam.

503
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:23,769
Maybe London.

504
00:38:23,853 --> 00:38:28,269
This bouquet was hand-engineered
to someone's specifications.

505
00:38:28,353 --> 00:38:32,103
- Is there a way of knowing which shops?
- Of course. We'll give you a list.

506
00:38:32,186 --> 00:38:35,186
It'll be short.

507
00:38:46,478 --> 00:38:48,728
I need opera tickets.

508
00:38:48,811 --> 00:38:51,269
I don't think I got any on me.

509
00:38:51,353 --> 00:38:53,894
It's sold out,
whatever it's called.

510
00:38:53,978 --> 00:38:57,853
It's the pretty, young wife with the
ever-open beak who needs opera tickets.

511
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:08,894
- Benetti.
- What?

512
00:39:08,978 --> 00:39:10,228
Rewind it.

513
00:39:10,311 --> 00:39:13,269
I can't rewind it.
I'm making a copy. I'm recording.

514
00:39:24,853 --> 00:39:26,228
What is this?

515
00:39:26,269 --> 00:39:29,061
Security camera from a perfume shop
in Via Della Scala.

516
00:39:29,144 --> 00:39:31,144
FBI, through Interpol,
requested a copy.

517
00:39:31,228 --> 00:39:33,644
- Why?
- They didn't say.

518
00:39:35,603 --> 00:39:38,728
- They didn't say?
- No. It was actually kind of weird.

519
00:39:38,811 --> 00:39:41,686
They were making a point
not to say.

520
00:41:25,853 --> 00:41:28,894
- Are we going to the opera?
- Yes.

521
00:41:28,978 --> 00:41:31,603
Sorry. Yes, we are going.

522
00:41:31,686 --> 00:41:33,603
You got tickets?

523
00:41:33,686 --> 00:41:37,144
No, but I will. In fact,
I was just about to look here.

524
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:42,603
Please, not the back row.
I would like to see it this time.

525
00:41:43,894 --> 00:41:46,061
Nowhere near the back row...

526
00:41:46,103 --> 00:41:48,478
no matter what the cost.

527
00:43:57,394 --> 00:43:59,728
Tell me, Clarice,
would you want to harm...

528
00:43:59,811 --> 00:44:01,936
those who forced you
to consider it, though?

529
00:44:02,019 --> 00:44:04,144
It's perfectly okay to admit it.

530
00:44:04,228 --> 00:44:07,144
It's perfectly au naturel...

531
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:09,019
to want to taste the enemy.

532
00:44:23,978 --> 00:44:26,228
It just feels so good.
Tell me, Clarice.

533
00:44:26,311 --> 00:44:28,728
What is your worst memory
of childhood?

534
00:44:28,769 --> 00:44:31,394
- Jesus, Starling!
- Can I help you, Mr. Krendler?

535
00:44:31,436 --> 00:44:33,436
What are you doing
sitting there in the dark?

536
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:35,228
Thinking about cannibalism.

537
00:44:35,311 --> 00:44:39,228
People in Justice are thinking too.
You know that?

538
00:44:39,269 --> 00:44:41,311
They're thinking, " What exactly
is she doing about Lecter?"

539
00:44:41,394 --> 00:44:43,769
Aren't you curious
why he dines on his victims?

540
00:44:43,853 --> 00:44:46,061
What's the point of that?

541
00:44:46,144 --> 00:44:48,144
Are you writing a book
or are you catching a crook?

542
00:44:48,228 --> 00:44:51,436
To show his contempt
for those who exasperate him.

543
00:44:52,811 --> 00:44:55,728
Or sometimes to perform
a public service.

544
00:44:55,769 --> 00:44:58,394
In the case of the flutist,
Benjamin Raspail...

545
00:44:58,436 --> 00:45:02,728
he did it to improve the sound of
the Baltimore Philharmonic Orchestra...

546
00:45:02,769 --> 00:45:05,811
serving the not-so-talented flute
player's sweetbreads to the board...

547
00:45:05,894 --> 00:45:08,686
with a nice Montrachet
at $700 a bottle.

548
00:45:09,811 --> 00:45:11,644
Wow.

549
00:45:11,728 --> 00:45:14,603
That meal began with green oysters
from the Gironde...

550
00:45:14,686 --> 00:45:17,978
followed by the sweetbreads,
a sorbet...

551
00:45:18,061 --> 00:45:20,811
and then you can read here
in Gourmet Cuisine:

552
00:45:20,894 --> 00:45:24,644
"A notable dark and glossy ragout,
the constituents never determined."

553
00:45:25,936 --> 00:45:27,603
I always figured him
for a queer.

554
00:45:27,686 --> 00:45:29,561
Why would you say that, Paul?

555
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:32,561
All this artsy-fartsy stuff.

556
00:45:32,603 --> 00:45:36,561
Chamber music, tea-party food.
Not that I mean anything personal...

557
00:45:36,644 --> 00:45:39,894
if you've got a lot of sympathy
for those people.

558
00:45:41,769 --> 00:45:44,561
What I came to impress
upon you, Starling...

559
00:45:44,603 --> 00:45:46,603
is I better see cooperation.

560
00:45:46,686 --> 00:45:49,103
There are no little fiefdoms here.

561
00:45:49,186 --> 00:45:51,936
I want to be copied
on every 302, you understand?

562
00:45:53,269 --> 00:45:55,144
If you work with me...

563
00:45:55,228 --> 00:45:58,269
then your so-called career here
might improve.

564
00:45:59,769 --> 00:46:03,936
If you don't,
then all I have to do...

565
00:46:04,019 --> 00:46:07,436
is draw a line through your name
rather than under it...

566
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:08,894
and it's over.

567
00:46:08,978 --> 00:46:11,394
Paul, what is it with you?

568
00:46:11,478 --> 00:46:14,603
I told you to go home to your wife.
That was wrong?

569
00:46:14,686 --> 00:46:17,894
What? Don't flatter yourself,
Starling.

570
00:46:17,936 --> 00:46:20,603
That was a long time ago.

571
00:46:20,686 --> 00:46:23,353
Why would I hold that
against you?

572
00:46:25,103 --> 00:46:27,228
And besides...

573
00:46:27,269 --> 00:46:29,894
this town is full
of corn pone, country pussy.

574
00:46:31,561 --> 00:46:33,394
That said...

575
00:46:33,436 --> 00:46:36,561
I wouldn't mind having a go with you
right now, if you want to reconsider.

576
00:46:36,644 --> 00:46:40,061
In the gym, anytime. No pads.

577
00:46:44,436 --> 00:46:46,936
Is it possible it went out
with the regular mail?

578
00:46:47,019 --> 00:46:51,144
No, I overnighted it to you.
I filled out the slip myself.

579
00:46:51,228 --> 00:46:53,394
This was the day after your request.

580
00:46:53,478 --> 00:46:56,603
I did it right away.
I don't understand what happened.

581
00:46:56,686 --> 00:46:58,394
You should have it by now.

582
00:46:58,478 --> 00:47:00,769
I don't.
Can you send me another one?

583
00:47:00,853 --> 00:47:03,436
Sure, I'll make another copy
especially for you.

584
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:07,269
Agent Clarice? Is that right?
Can I call you Clarice?

585
00:47:07,353 --> 00:47:08,728
Agent Starling.

586
00:47:08,811 --> 00:47:11,561
I'd appreciate it.
What's your name?

587
00:47:11,644 --> 00:47:13,436
My name is Franco Benetti.

588
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:15,519
Agent Franco Benetti.

589
00:47:15,603 --> 00:47:17,936
- Thank you very much, Agent Benetti.
- Okay.

590
00:47:18,019 --> 00:47:20,561
- So I'll send you tomorrow?
- All right.

591
00:47:20,644 --> 00:47:23,394
Bye-bye.

592
00:47:23,436 --> 00:47:25,561
Nothin', huh?

593
00:47:25,644 --> 00:47:28,103
Nothin' yet.
Still waitin' on Florence and London.

594
00:48:05,186 --> 00:48:08,561
The number you have dialed
is not in service at this time.

595
00:48:08,644 --> 00:48:11,061
Please check the number...

596
00:48:33,144 --> 00:48:34,936
Yes?

597
00:48:36,394 --> 00:48:39,269
I have information
about Hannibal Lecter.

598
00:48:39,353 --> 00:48:42,103
Have you shared your information
with the police, sir?

599
00:48:42,186 --> 00:48:44,811
I'm required
to encourage you to do so.

600
00:48:46,686 --> 00:48:50,978
Is the reward payable
under special circumstances?

601
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:53,478
May I suggest you contact
an attorney...

602
00:48:53,561 --> 00:48:56,228
before taking any possibly
illegal action?

603
00:48:56,269 --> 00:48:59,394
There's one in Geneva
who's excellent in these matters.

604
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:01,478
May I give you his toll-free number?

605
00:49:01,561 --> 00:49:07,644
The number is 004123317.

606
00:49:07,728 --> 00:49:10,144
Thank you for calling.

607
00:49:28,728 --> 00:49:31,811
Yes. I was just speaking
with someone who suggested...

608
00:49:31,894 --> 00:49:34,103
There's a $ 100,000 advance.

609
00:49:34,186 --> 00:49:36,186
To qualify for the advance...

610
00:49:36,269 --> 00:49:39,394
a fingerprint must be provided,
in situ, on an object.

611
00:49:39,436 --> 00:49:42,894
Once the print
has been positively identified...

612
00:49:42,936 --> 00:49:45,561
the balance of the money
will be placed in escrow...

613
00:49:45,603 --> 00:49:47,436
at Geneve Credit Suisse...

614
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:51,978
and may be viewed at any time
subject to 24-hour prior notification.

615
00:49:52,061 --> 00:49:54,728
To repeat the message in French,
press two.

616
00:49:54,811 --> 00:49:57,644
In Spanish, press three.
In German...

617
00:50:24,561 --> 00:50:27,228
Dr. Fell, it's Inspector Pazzi.

618
00:50:27,269 --> 00:50:29,769
Yes, I can see you.

619
00:50:29,853 --> 00:50:31,561
Come on up.

620
00:50:43,561 --> 00:50:45,353
Dr. Fell?

621
00:51:25,161 --> 00:51:27,369
Snap.

622
00:51:27,452 --> 00:51:29,911
I should have encouraged you
to bring someone along.

623
00:51:29,994 --> 00:51:31,994
The cases are on the heavy side.

624
00:51:32,077 --> 00:51:34,452
Maybe you could help me
with them.

625
00:51:35,786 --> 00:51:38,327
Just down the stairs, I mean.

626
00:51:40,286 --> 00:51:42,119
Yeah.

627
00:51:42,202 --> 00:51:45,036
This way.

628
00:51:45,077 --> 00:51:47,494
Here we are.

629
00:51:50,952 --> 00:51:53,619
- Is that the inventory?
- Yes.

630
00:51:55,744 --> 00:51:58,786
- May I see it?
- Of course.

631
00:52:08,411 --> 00:52:13,661
You are a Pazzi
of the Pazzi family, I think.

632
00:52:14,827 --> 00:52:19,286
Wasn't it at the Palazzo Vecchio
your ancestor was hanged?

633
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:21,036
Francesco de' Pazzi.

634
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,494
Yes, thrown naked with a noose
around his neck from a window.

635
00:52:25,827 --> 00:52:28,286
Writhing and kicking
alongside the archbishop...

636
00:52:28,369 --> 00:52:31,369
against the cold stone wall.

637
00:52:31,452 --> 00:52:34,577
In fact, I found
a very nice rendering of it...

638
00:52:34,661 --> 00:52:37,411
here in the library the other day.

639
00:52:37,494 --> 00:52:41,161
If you like, perhaps
I could sneak it out for you.

640
00:52:42,577 --> 00:52:45,369
I would think that might
jeopardize your chances...

641
00:52:45,411 --> 00:52:48,411
for permanent appointment
to the curatorship.

642
00:52:48,494 --> 00:52:50,494
Only if you told.

643
00:52:51,869 --> 00:52:54,869
Remind me...
what was his crime?

644
00:52:54,952 --> 00:52:57,702
He was accused of killing
Giuliano de' Medici.

645
00:52:57,786 --> 00:52:59,077
Unjustly?

646
00:52:59,161 --> 00:53:02,911
No, I don't think so.

647
00:53:02,994 --> 00:53:05,952
Then he wasn't just accused.
He did it. He was guilty.

648
00:53:06,036 --> 00:53:10,369
I think that would make living
in Florence with the name Pazzi...

649
00:53:10,411 --> 00:53:13,619
uncomfortable,
even 500 years later.

650
00:53:14,744 --> 00:53:16,869
Not really.

651
00:53:16,952 --> 00:53:20,411
In fact, I can't remember
the last time...

652
00:53:20,494 --> 00:53:22,036
before today...

653
00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:24,119
someone brought it up.

654
00:53:32,077 --> 00:53:35,702
People don't always tell you
what they're thinking.

655
00:53:35,744 --> 00:53:38,036
They just see to it you don't...

656
00:53:38,077 --> 00:53:41,161
advance in life.

657
00:53:44,911 --> 00:53:47,577
I'm sorry, Commendatore.

658
00:53:47,661 --> 00:53:50,244
I too often say what I'm thinking.

659
00:53:52,202 --> 00:53:54,119
I'll be right back to help you.

660
00:54:08,619 --> 00:54:13,536
You know, the room you're standing in
was built in the 15th century.

661
00:54:13,577 --> 00:54:15,369
It's beautiful.

662
00:54:16,536 --> 00:54:18,369
Yes, it is.

663
00:54:18,411 --> 00:54:20,619
Unfortunately, I think...

664
00:54:20,702 --> 00:54:24,661
the heating system was installed
about the same time.

665
00:54:25,911 --> 00:54:29,077
- That's a pity.
- Yes.

666
00:54:31,036 --> 00:54:34,244
Okeydokey.
Let's drag these down.

667
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:37,827
Must be as heavy as bodies.

668
00:55:07,286 --> 00:55:09,911
- And the set?
- Eight thousand.

669
00:55:09,994 --> 00:55:11,369
Okay.

670
00:55:12,244 --> 00:55:15,202
Hey, how much is this?

671
00:55:15,286 --> 00:55:17,577
- Fifty thousand.
- I'll take it.

672
00:55:41,411 --> 00:55:42,911
Well done.

673
00:55:51,661 --> 00:55:55,411
When you go for his wallet,
he'll catch you by the wrist.

674
00:55:55,494 --> 00:55:57,577
I have done this
a few times, Inspector.

675
00:55:57,661 --> 00:55:59,661
Not like this.

676
00:56:00,494 --> 00:56:04,077
If there isn't a clean print
on the bracelet...

677
00:56:04,161 --> 00:56:07,452
you'll spend the summer
in a cell at the Sollicciano.

678
00:56:09,702 --> 00:56:12,036
Give me the bracelet.

679
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:14,661
Wash your fucking hands.

680
00:56:24,661 --> 00:56:26,744
He's coming.

681
00:58:16,036 --> 00:58:17,994
I got it.

682
00:58:24,119 --> 00:58:26,119
He grabbed me just right.

683
00:58:29,161 --> 00:58:31,744
Tried to hit me in the balls.

684
00:58:35,702 --> 00:58:37,661
But he missed.

685
00:58:42,786 --> 00:58:44,577
Let me help you.

686
00:58:44,661 --> 00:58:46,577
No. Don't.

687
00:59:43,244 --> 00:59:45,327
Sixteen-point match, Mr. Verger.

688
00:59:47,494 --> 00:59:48,577
Bingo.

689
01:00:07,694 --> 01:00:10,277
- Carlo?
- Mason?

690
01:00:12,777 --> 01:00:15,277
Well, well, well.

691
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:19,361
- Am I coming to see you?
- Yes, soon, I hope.

692
01:00:19,444 --> 01:00:23,027
But first I need you
to pack off the boys.

693
01:00:23,111 --> 01:00:25,194
- Now?
- Yes, I know.

694
01:00:25,277 --> 01:00:28,111
The day you never
thought would arrive has.

695
01:00:28,194 --> 01:00:30,736
Now, Cordell will fax
the veterinary forms...

696
01:00:30,819 --> 01:00:33,986
directly to
Animal and Plant Health...

697
01:00:34,069 --> 01:00:36,069
but you need to get
the vet affidavits...

698
01:00:36,152 --> 01:00:37,777
from Sardinia.

699
01:00:41,694 --> 01:00:43,236
How are they?

700
01:00:43,319 --> 01:00:45,861
They are big, Mason,
very big.

701
01:00:52,861 --> 01:00:55,736
- Say again?
- Yeah, they are big, Mason.

702
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:59,736
Really big.
Maybe 270 kilos.

703
01:00:59,777 --> 01:01:02,277
Oh, wow.

704
01:01:02,361 --> 01:01:03,944
Can you hear?

705
01:01:16,277 --> 01:01:18,444
They sound fantastic.

706
01:01:28,527 --> 01:01:29,777
Super.

707
01:02:05,604 --> 01:02:10,812
The full balance of the money is payable
upon receipt of the doctor, alive.

708
01:02:10,854 --> 01:02:13,437
Of course, you won't have to
seize him yourself.

709
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:15,437
Rather, just point him out.

710
01:02:16,271 --> 01:02:20,479
It's preferable to all concerned if
that's the extent of your involvement...

711
01:02:20,521 --> 01:02:22,187
from this point.

712
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:26,354
I prefer to stay involved,
make sure things go right.

713
01:02:26,437 --> 01:02:28,354
Professionals will see to that.

714
01:02:30,396 --> 01:02:32,146
I am a professional.

715
01:04:55,354 --> 01:04:57,854
Did you enjoy the performance,
Commendatore?

716
01:04:57,937 --> 01:04:59,854
Very much.

717
01:04:59,937 --> 01:05:04,312
Allegra, this is Dr. Fell,
curator of the Capponi Library.

718
01:05:04,396 --> 01:05:05,729
Signora Pazzi.

719
01:05:05,812 --> 01:05:07,729
I'm honored.

720
01:05:07,812 --> 01:05:09,729
Are you from America,
Doctor?

721
01:05:09,812 --> 01:05:12,479
Not originally.
I've travelled there.

722
01:05:12,521 --> 01:05:15,562
I've always wanted to visit.
New England, especially.

723
01:05:15,646 --> 01:05:18,437
I've enjoyed many
excellent meals there.

724
01:05:19,646 --> 01:05:23,187
I noticed you wrapped up
in the libretto.

725
01:05:23,271 --> 01:05:25,187
Thought this might amuse you.

726
01:05:27,312 --> 01:05:30,229
Dante's first sonnet
from La Vita Nuova.

727
01:05:30,312 --> 01:05:32,229
It's beautiful.

728
01:05:33,479 --> 01:05:36,396
- Rinaldo, look at this.
- I can see.

729
01:05:37,979 --> 01:05:40,229
"Joyous Love seemed to me...

730
01:05:40,312 --> 01:05:43,396
the while he held
my heart in his hands...

731
01:05:43,479 --> 01:05:45,229
and in his arms...

732
01:05:45,312 --> 01:05:47,687
my lady lay asleep...

733
01:05:47,771 --> 01:05:49,687
wrapped in a veil."

734
01:05:50,687 --> 01:05:51,979
"He woke her then...

735
01:05:52,021 --> 01:05:56,812
and trembling and obedient, she ate
that burning heart out of his hand.

736
01:05:56,896 --> 01:05:59,062
Weeping, I saw him
then depart from me."

737
01:05:59,854 --> 01:06:05,062
Dr. Fell, do you believe a man could
become so obsessed with a woman...

738
01:06:05,146 --> 01:06:07,729
from a single encounter?

739
01:06:07,812 --> 01:06:10,729
Could he daily feel
a stab of hunger for her...

740
01:06:10,812 --> 01:06:13,729
and find nourishment
in the very sight of her?

741
01:06:13,812 --> 01:06:16,021
I think so.

742
01:06:16,104 --> 01:06:20,521
But would she see through the bars
of his plight and ache for him?

743
01:06:20,604 --> 01:06:22,896
- Please keep that.
- I couldn't.

744
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,562
I insist.

745
01:06:35,062 --> 01:06:36,229
Good-bye.

746
01:06:37,812 --> 01:06:40,729
- Let's get something to eat.
- Of course.

747
01:06:40,812 --> 01:06:42,729
Why not?

748
01:07:15,187 --> 01:07:17,187
Is that you, Doctor?

749
01:08:07,896 --> 01:08:10,896
I'd like to speak with
Chief Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi, please.

750
01:08:10,979 --> 01:08:14,187
This is Agent Clarice Starling
from the American FBI.

751
01:08:14,271 --> 01:08:15,562
One moment.

752
01:08:18,146 --> 01:08:21,062
- FBI.
- I'm not here.

753
01:08:25,896 --> 01:08:27,062
Inspector Pazzi.

754
01:08:27,146 --> 01:08:29,979
It's Agent Starling
from the FBI. How do you do?

755
01:08:30,062 --> 01:08:33,687
Actually, I was just
leaving for the day.

756
01:08:33,771 --> 01:08:35,896
- Can I call you back tomorrow?
- This won't take long.

757
01:08:35,979 --> 01:08:41,062
First, thank you for sending us the
security tape from the perfume store.

758
01:08:41,146 --> 01:08:44,812
When I say "you,"I mean
your department... Agent Benetti.

759
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:48,062
Is he there?
Can I speak with him?

760
01:08:48,146 --> 01:08:51,062
- I'm sorry. He's gone home.
- That's all right.

761
01:08:51,146 --> 01:08:53,396
I should tell you this
rather than him anyway.

762
01:08:53,479 --> 01:08:55,812
I'm late for
an important appointment.

763
01:08:55,854 --> 01:08:58,479
The person I'm looking for,
Inspector...

764
01:08:58,562 --> 01:09:01,562
who is indeed shown on that tape,
is Hannibal Lecter.

765
01:09:01,646 --> 01:09:03,229
Who?

766
01:09:03,312 --> 01:09:06,229
Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
You've never heard of him?

767
01:09:06,312 --> 01:09:10,062
- I'm not familiar.
- And the tape confirms...

768
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:12,729
that he is
or was recently in Florence.

769
01:09:14,437 --> 01:09:17,437
- Really?
- He's a very dangerous man, Inspector.

770
01:09:17,521 --> 01:09:20,896
He's killed 14 people
that we know of.

771
01:09:20,979 --> 01:09:23,312
- I really have to go, Miss...
- Starling.

772
01:09:23,396 --> 01:09:25,062
Just another minute.

773
01:09:25,146 --> 01:09:28,062
- You sure you've never heard of him?
- No, I haven't.

774
01:09:28,146 --> 01:09:30,062
Because I'm confused.

775
01:09:30,146 --> 01:09:34,562
Someone there has been accessing
our private VICAP files on Dr. Lecter...

776
01:09:34,646 --> 01:09:37,646
with some regularity
on your computer.

777
01:09:37,729 --> 01:09:41,646
Everybody uses
everybody's computer here.

778
01:09:41,729 --> 01:09:44,646
Maybe one of the detectives
on II Mostro...

779
01:09:44,729 --> 01:09:46,687
was looking at
profiles of killers...

780
01:09:46,771 --> 01:09:49,229
I'm speaking about the computer
at your home, sir.

781
01:09:50,812 --> 01:09:54,271
You're trying to catch him yourself,
aren't you? For the reward.

782
01:09:54,354 --> 01:09:56,937
I cannot warn you
strongly enough against that.

783
01:09:57,021 --> 01:09:59,896
He killed three policemen
down in Memphis while in custody...

784
01:09:59,979 --> 01:10:03,687
tearing the face off one of them,
and he will kill you too.

785
01:10:38,437 --> 01:10:41,812
- I want him out of Tuscany fast.
- Believe me...

786
01:10:41,896 --> 01:10:44,854
he'll be gone
from the face of the earth fast.

787
01:10:44,937 --> 01:10:46,521
Feetfirst.

788
01:11:06,312 --> 01:11:09,854
Because of his avarice and his betrayal
of the emperor's trust...

789
01:11:09,937 --> 01:11:14,187
Pier della Vigna was disgraced,
blinded and imprisoned.

790
01:11:14,271 --> 01:11:19,854
Dante's pilgrim finds Pier della Vigna
on the seventh level of the Inferno...

791
01:11:19,937 --> 01:11:23,396
and, likeJudas Iscariot,
he died by hanging.

792
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:26,312
SoJudas and Pier della Vigna
are linked in Dante...

793
01:11:26,396 --> 01:11:28,729
by the avarice
he saw in them.

794
01:11:28,812 --> 01:11:33,146
In fact, avarice and hanging
are linked in the medieval mind.

795
01:11:33,229 --> 01:11:36,646
This is the earliest known
depiction of the Crucifixion...

796
01:11:36,687 --> 01:11:40,979
carved on an ivory box in Gaul
about A.D. 400.

797
01:11:41,062 --> 01:11:45,896
It includes the death
by hanging ofJudas...

798
01:11:45,979 --> 01:11:47,896
his face upturned
to the branch that suspends him.

799
01:11:47,979 --> 01:11:50,937
Here he is again on the doors
of the Benevento Cathedral...

800
01:11:51,021 --> 01:11:54,896
this time
with his bowels falling out.

801
01:12:02,021 --> 01:12:05,354
It wasn't easy, but I got this number
without tellin'them why...

802
01:12:05,437 --> 01:12:07,812
- Sorry.
- Not at all. Welcome.

803
01:12:07,896 --> 01:12:11,229
- Please join us.
- Thank you.

804
01:12:11,312 --> 01:12:14,229
On this plate from the
15th-century edition of the Inferno...

805
01:12:14,312 --> 01:12:17,812
Pier della Vigna's body
hangs from a bleeding tree.

806
01:12:17,896 --> 01:12:20,812
I will not belabor the obvious
parallel with Judas Iscariot...

807
01:12:20,896 --> 01:12:23,812
but Dante Alighieri
needed no drawn illustration.

808
01:12:23,896 --> 01:12:28,479
It was his genius to make
Pier della Vigna, now in hell...

809
01:12:28,562 --> 01:12:31,479
speak in strained hisses
and coughing sibilants...

810
01:12:31,562 --> 01:12:34,437
as though
he is hanging still.

811
01:12:59,104 --> 01:13:01,479
Avarice, hanging...

812
01:13:01,521 --> 01:13:03,104
self-destruction.

813
01:13:07,479 --> 01:13:09,687
"I make my own home...

814
01:13:10,771 --> 01:13:12,687
be my gallows."

815
01:13:14,146 --> 01:13:17,312
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,
for your kind attention.

816
01:13:33,271 --> 01:13:36,396
I'm not a scholar,
but I think you've got the job.

817
01:13:36,479 --> 01:13:37,729
Thank you.

818
01:13:37,812 --> 01:13:40,729
- May I buy you a drink?
- How kind of you. I'd like that.

819
01:13:40,812 --> 01:13:43,729
I'll be a minute
gathering my things.

820
01:13:43,812 --> 01:13:45,771
Take your time.

821
01:13:55,396 --> 01:13:59,562
Allegra, I'll be home
just a little later than I said.

822
01:13:59,646 --> 01:14:01,604
I'm taking Dr. Fell out
for a drink.

823
01:14:05,271 --> 01:14:07,396
I can see the people
coming out now.

824
01:14:09,646 --> 01:14:12,312
Yes. Bye, honey. My wife.

825
01:14:12,396 --> 01:14:14,021
Of course.

826
01:14:16,437 --> 01:14:19,146
I should have shown them
this one.

827
01:14:19,187 --> 01:14:22,979
I can't imagine how I missed it.
Remember? I told you about it.

828
01:14:23,062 --> 01:14:25,687
It's a rendering
I found in the Capponi Library.

829
01:14:25,771 --> 01:14:28,521
Can you make it out?

830
01:14:28,604 --> 01:14:31,354
There's a name there...

831
01:14:31,437 --> 01:14:33,521
the one I told you about.

832
01:14:46,521 --> 01:14:48,646
It's your ancestor,
Commendatore...

833
01:14:48,729 --> 01:14:51,312
hanging beneath
these very windows.

834
01:14:51,396 --> 01:14:53,271
Francesco de' Pazzi.

835
01:14:54,521 --> 01:14:58,104
On a related subject,
I must confess to you...

836
01:14:58,187 --> 01:15:00,771
I'm giving very serious thought...

837
01:15:06,854 --> 01:15:08,854
to eating your wife.

838
01:15:42,146 --> 01:15:45,146
If you tell me what I need to know,
Commendatore...

839
01:15:45,229 --> 01:15:47,812
it might be convenient for me
to leave Florence without my meal.

840
01:15:47,896 --> 01:15:51,479
So I'll ask you the questions,
and then we'll see. All right?

841
01:15:51,562 --> 01:15:52,896
Okay?

842
01:16:05,479 --> 01:16:06,729
So.

843
01:16:09,437 --> 01:16:11,854
Now, is it Mason Verger
you sold me to?

844
01:16:14,062 --> 01:16:15,604
No, no.

845
01:16:15,687 --> 01:16:17,896
Blink twice for yes,
once for no.

846
01:16:17,979 --> 01:16:20,521
Was it Mason Verger
you sold me to?

847
01:16:22,146 --> 01:16:24,062
Yes, good. Thank you.

848
01:16:24,146 --> 01:16:27,062
And are his men
waiting for me outside?

849
01:16:28,812 --> 01:16:30,896
Was that a single blink?

850
01:16:30,979 --> 01:16:32,854
You're confused.

851
01:16:32,937 --> 01:16:37,062
Please don't be confused, because I may
have to fillet Signora Pazzi after all.

852
01:16:40,229 --> 01:16:42,687
Have you told anyone
in the questura about me?

853
01:16:44,229 --> 01:16:46,146
No, I thought not.

854
01:16:46,812 --> 01:16:49,854
Have you told Allegra?

855
01:16:52,354 --> 01:16:54,354
No? Are you sure?

856
01:16:56,396 --> 01:16:58,062
I believe you.

857
01:17:00,646 --> 01:17:03,021
Okeydokey, here we go.

858
01:17:09,562 --> 01:17:10,812
Okay.

859
01:17:12,396 --> 01:17:13,979
Your heart is really palpitating.

860
01:17:14,062 --> 01:17:16,979
Oh, it's not your heart.

861
01:17:18,937 --> 01:17:21,062
Shall I answer it?

862
01:17:23,396 --> 01:17:26,062
I've gone above you.
I've spoken to your section chief.

863
01:17:26,146 --> 01:17:28,896
Someday you'll thank me.
Or you won't. I don't care.

864
01:17:28,979 --> 01:17:31,312
You'll be alive.

865
01:17:31,396 --> 01:17:33,271
Inspector Pazzi?

866
01:17:34,229 --> 01:17:36,521
Is this Clarice?

867
01:17:36,604 --> 01:17:39,062
Hello, Clarice.

868
01:17:40,187 --> 01:17:42,062
I'm afraid I have
bad news for you.

869
01:17:42,146 --> 01:17:45,312
- Is he dead?
- Did you get my note?

870
01:17:45,354 --> 01:17:48,021
I hope you like the skin cream.
I had it specially made for you.

871
01:17:48,104 --> 01:17:50,021
Is he dead, Dr. Lecter?

872
01:17:50,104 --> 01:17:54,229
I would love nothing more in this world
than to be able to chat with you.

873
01:17:54,312 --> 01:17:57,479
Unfortunately, you've caught me
at an awkward moment.

874
01:17:57,562 --> 01:17:59,812
Please forgive me.

875
01:17:59,896 --> 01:18:01,646
See you around.

876
01:18:03,896 --> 01:18:05,896
An old friend.

877
01:18:09,896 --> 01:18:11,437
Okay, hold on.

878
01:18:13,187 --> 01:18:14,646
Here we go.

879
01:18:46,937 --> 01:18:51,062
I'll go around back!
Kill him if you have to!

880
01:18:54,271 --> 01:18:56,229
What's it to be?

881
01:18:56,312 --> 01:18:58,479
Bowels in or bowels out...

882
01:18:58,562 --> 01:19:00,562
likeJudas?

883
01:19:00,646 --> 01:19:02,479
Are you confused?

884
01:19:02,562 --> 01:19:05,396
I'll decide for you,
if you'll permit me.

885
01:20:18,896 --> 01:20:20,187
Good evening.

886
01:21:27,479 --> 01:21:30,021
Cordell...

887
01:21:30,104 --> 01:21:32,021
to you...

888
01:21:32,104 --> 01:21:35,479
does that look
like a wave good-bye...

889
01:21:36,771 --> 01:21:39,187
or hello?

890
01:22:25,662 --> 01:22:28,829
So, what do you think?

891
01:22:28,912 --> 01:22:33,996
Does Lecter want to fuck her
or kill her or eat her or what?

892
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:36,662
Probably all three.

893
01:22:36,746 --> 01:22:39,371
Though I wouldn't want
to predict in what order.

894
01:22:40,954 --> 01:22:43,537
Here's what I think.

895
01:22:43,621 --> 01:22:47,704
No matter how Barney
might want to romanticize it...

896
01:22:47,787 --> 01:22:51,662
and make it
Beauty and the Beast...

897
01:22:51,746 --> 01:22:54,912
Lecter's object, as I know
from personal experience...

898
01:22:54,996 --> 01:22:57,204
has always been...

899
01:22:57,287 --> 01:22:59,412
degradation...

900
01:22:59,496 --> 01:23:01,746
and suffering.

901
01:23:01,829 --> 01:23:06,579
Get this damn thing off me.
I can't breathe in this thing.

902
01:23:09,162 --> 01:23:12,329
He comes in the guise
of a mentor...

903
01:23:12,412 --> 01:23:15,829
as he did with me and her.

904
01:23:15,871 --> 01:23:19,829
But it's distress that excites him.

905
01:23:19,912 --> 01:23:21,829
To draw him...

906
01:23:23,162 --> 01:23:25,579
she needs to be distressed.

907
01:23:28,371 --> 01:23:32,746
To make her attractive to him,
let him see her distressed.

908
01:23:34,871 --> 01:23:37,454
Let the damage he sees...

909
01:23:37,537 --> 01:23:40,537
suggest the damage
he could do.

910
01:23:49,871 --> 01:23:53,621
When the fox hears the rabbit scream,
he comes a-runnin'.

911
01:23:55,412 --> 01:23:57,412
But not to help.

912
01:23:57,496 --> 01:23:59,412
I don't understand.

913
01:23:59,496 --> 01:24:01,621
There's nothing
to understand, Paul.

914
01:24:01,704 --> 01:24:05,537
All you have to understand
is what it's worth to you.

915
01:24:05,621 --> 01:24:08,537
No, no, I don't understand
why she didn't turn this over.

916
01:24:08,621 --> 01:24:10,579
I mean, she's such
a straight arrow.

917
01:24:10,662 --> 01:24:14,037
She didn't turn it over
because she didn't receive it.

918
01:24:14,121 --> 01:24:16,162
She didn't receive it
because it was never sent.

919
01:24:16,246 --> 01:24:18,662
It was never sent because
Lecter didn't write it.

920
01:24:18,746 --> 01:24:21,287
He didn't write it
because I did.

921
01:24:26,621 --> 01:24:28,537
So, what do you think?

922
01:24:28,621 --> 01:24:32,037
You'd have been better off if
you'd never got her out of trouble.

923
01:24:32,121 --> 01:24:36,121
Oh, woulda, shoulda, coulda. I meant,
what do you think about the money?

924
01:24:36,204 --> 01:24:37,371
Five.

925
01:24:38,454 --> 01:24:42,871
Let's just toss it off, like "five."

926
01:24:42,954 --> 01:24:45,912
Let's say it
with the respect it deserves.

927
01:24:45,996 --> 01:24:48,954
Five hundred thousand dollars.

928
01:24:49,037 --> 01:24:50,912
That's better, but not much.

929
01:24:50,996 --> 01:24:53,412
- Now, will it work?
- It'll work.

930
01:24:53,496 --> 01:24:55,621
It won't be pretty.

931
01:24:55,704 --> 01:24:57,704
What ever is?

932
01:25:01,162 --> 01:25:03,329
Cocksucker.

933
01:25:03,412 --> 01:25:06,371
Never seen this before
in my life.

934
01:25:06,454 --> 01:25:10,829
Then how do you account for its being
found in your office, your basement?

935
01:25:10,912 --> 01:25:13,829
How do you want me to answer that,
Mr. Krendler?

936
01:25:13,912 --> 01:25:16,829
What possible reason
might I have to withhold it?

937
01:25:16,912 --> 01:25:20,162
Perhaps because of the nature
of its content.

938
01:25:20,246 --> 01:25:23,204
Reads to me like a love letter.

939
01:25:23,287 --> 01:25:26,371
- Has it been tested for prints?
- No prints on it. None on the last one.

940
01:25:26,454 --> 01:25:28,329
Handwriting analysis?

941
01:25:28,412 --> 01:25:32,037
"Did you ever think, Clarice, why
the philistines don't understand you?

942
01:25:32,121 --> 01:25:34,412
It's because you're the answer
to Samson's riddle.

943
01:25:34,496 --> 01:25:36,579
You are the honey in the lion."

944
01:25:36,662 --> 01:25:38,162
Sounds like him to me.

945
01:25:38,246 --> 01:25:42,537
- Do you mean, like a homosexual?
- Like a nut with a crush.

946
01:25:42,621 --> 01:25:43,996
Director Noonan,
I need to say something...

947
01:25:44,037 --> 01:25:46,537
Agent Starling, I am placing you
on administrative leave...

948
01:25:46,621 --> 01:25:50,829
till document analysis tells me
unequivocally a mistake's been made.

949
01:25:50,871 --> 01:25:54,079
In the meantime, you remain eligible
for insurance and medical benefits.

950
01:25:54,162 --> 01:25:57,246
Surrender your weapons and
your identification to Agent Pearsall.

951
01:26:10,162 --> 01:26:12,912
I want to say something.
I think I'm entitled.

952
01:26:12,996 --> 01:26:14,746
Go ahead.

953
01:26:14,829 --> 01:26:18,287
I think Mr. Mason Verger is
trying to capture Dr. Lecter...

954
01:26:18,371 --> 01:26:20,371
for the purposes
of personal revenge.

955
01:26:20,454 --> 01:26:22,954
I think Mr. Krendler
is in collusion with him...

956
01:26:23,037 --> 01:26:25,996
and wants the FBI's efforts against
Dr. Lecter to work for Mr. Verger.

957
01:26:26,037 --> 01:26:28,912
I think Mr. Krendler
is being paid to do this.

958
01:26:28,996 --> 01:26:32,704
- Lucky you're not sworn here today.
- Swear me! You swear too!

959
01:26:32,787 --> 01:26:35,537
Clarice,
if the evidence is lacking...

960
01:26:35,621 --> 01:26:38,246
you'll be entitled to full reinstatement
without prejudice...

961
01:26:38,329 --> 01:26:42,746
if you don't do or say
anything in the meantime...

962
01:26:42,829 --> 01:26:45,329
that would make that impossible.

963
01:26:45,537 --> 01:26:48,871
Relieved of field duty pending
an internal investigation...

964
01:26:48,954 --> 01:26:51,912
Special Agent Clarice Starling,
a ten-year veteran on the Bureau...

965
01:26:51,996 --> 01:26:54,037
began her career
with an assignment...

966
01:26:54,121 --> 01:26:56,204
to interview lethal madman
Hannibal Lecter.

967
01:26:56,287 --> 01:27:00,121
Earlier, we heard comments from Justice
Department spokesman Paul Krendler.

968
01:27:01,246 --> 01:27:04,496
Can you comment on theJustice
Department's decision this morning?

969
01:27:04,579 --> 01:27:08,662
The FBI and theJustice Department are
looking very carefully into the charges.

970
01:27:08,746 --> 01:27:11,079
And, yes, they are extremely serious.

971
01:27:11,162 --> 01:27:12,662
I'd like to add
a personal note, though.

972
01:27:12,746 --> 01:27:17,371
- Starling's one of our best agents.
- No, no, no, stay.

973
01:27:17,454 --> 01:27:21,454
I would be very surprised if these
accusations turn out to be true.

974
01:27:21,537 --> 01:27:24,996
Is theJustice Department and FBI
united in this decision?

975
01:27:25,079 --> 01:27:27,787
It's much too soon to condemn her...

976
01:28:12,996 --> 01:28:14,704
Good boy.

977
01:30:56,746 --> 01:30:59,162
I think she's nice.

978
01:30:59,204 --> 01:31:02,079
She's always been nice to me.
Polite.

979
01:31:02,162 --> 01:31:03,662
Don't you think?

980
01:31:03,746 --> 01:31:06,662
Do you know what
a roller pigeon is, Barney?

981
01:31:06,746 --> 01:31:09,079
Roller pigeons
climb high and fast...

982
01:31:09,162 --> 01:31:12,246
then roll over and fall
just as fast towards the Earth.

983
01:31:12,329 --> 01:31:15,662
There are shallow rollers
and there are deep rollers...

984
01:31:15,746 --> 01:31:19,162
but you can't breed two deep rollers,
or their young, their offspring...

985
01:31:19,246 --> 01:31:22,662
will roll all the way down,
hit and die.

986
01:31:22,746 --> 01:31:26,746
Agent Starling is a deep roller.

987
01:31:26,829 --> 01:31:29,746
Let's hope
one of her parents was not.

988
01:32:59,912 --> 01:33:02,329
The power in that battery
is low, Clarice.

989
01:33:02,412 --> 01:33:05,162
I would've changed it,
but I didn't want to wake you.

990
01:33:05,204 --> 01:33:09,537
Use the one in the charger. Hopefully,
the light on it is green by now.

991
01:33:09,621 --> 01:33:12,329
Because this is gonna be a long call
and I can't let you off...

992
01:33:12,412 --> 01:33:14,829
because even though
you've been stripped of your duties...

993
01:33:14,912 --> 01:33:18,204
I know you won't abandon them...
you'll try to put on a trace.

994
01:33:18,287 --> 01:33:21,912
So we'll disconnect long enough for you
to exchange the battery in the phone...

995
01:33:21,996 --> 01:33:23,996
for the one in the charger.

996
01:33:24,079 --> 01:33:27,079
Shall we say, three seconds?

997
01:33:27,162 --> 01:33:28,704
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

998
01:33:28,787 --> 01:33:29,746
Go.

999
01:33:35,287 --> 01:33:37,162
- Very good.
- Thank you.

1000
01:33:37,246 --> 01:33:40,162
Remember, Clarice, if you get caught
with a concealed, unlicensed firearm...

1001
01:33:40,246 --> 01:33:43,079
in the District of Columbia,
the penalty is very stiff.

1002
01:33:43,162 --> 01:33:46,746
But bring the guns if you have to.
Now get in your car.

1003
01:34:23,704 --> 01:34:25,996
The reason we're doing it
like this, Clarice...

1004
01:34:26,037 --> 01:34:30,079
is because I like to watch you
as we speak, with your eyes open.

1005
01:34:31,287 --> 01:34:34,912
No, it does not excite me.
It pleases me.

1006
01:34:34,996 --> 01:34:37,412
You have very shapely feet.

1007
01:34:40,579 --> 01:34:43,162
Where are we now?
Call it out.

1008
01:34:43,246 --> 01:34:45,037
Massachusetts Avenue.

1009
01:34:45,121 --> 01:34:46,996
Take it.

1010
01:34:47,079 --> 01:34:50,871
I thought, to begin with,
you might tell me how you're feeling.

1011
01:34:50,954 --> 01:34:51,912
About what?

1012
01:34:51,996 --> 01:34:54,871
The masters you serve
and how they've treated you.

1013
01:34:54,954 --> 01:34:57,662
Your career, such as it is.

1014
01:34:57,746 --> 01:34:59,662
Your life, Clarice.

1015
01:34:59,704 --> 01:35:01,662
I thought we might
talk about yours.

1016
01:35:01,746 --> 01:35:04,746
- What's the next cross street?
- Capitol Street.

1017
01:35:04,829 --> 01:35:09,079
In two blocks, make a left
into Union Station. Park.

1018
01:35:10,371 --> 01:35:12,829
My life? What is there
to say about mine?

1019
01:35:12,871 --> 01:35:15,954
I have been in a state of hibernation
for some time...

1020
01:35:16,037 --> 01:35:18,121
a little inactive.

1021
01:35:18,204 --> 01:35:21,496
But now I'm back home
and I'm very happy...

1022
01:35:21,579 --> 01:35:23,329
and very healthy.

1023
01:35:23,371 --> 01:35:27,746
- You. It's you I'm worried about.
- I'm fine.

1024
01:35:27,829 --> 01:35:30,662
No, you're certainly
not fine, Clarice.

1025
01:35:30,704 --> 01:35:33,412
You fell in love with the Bureau,
the institution...

1026
01:35:33,496 --> 01:35:36,871
only to discover, after giving it
everything you've got...

1027
01:35:36,954 --> 01:35:39,037
that it does not
love you back...

1028
01:35:39,121 --> 01:35:41,121
that, in fact, it resents you.

1029
01:35:41,204 --> 01:35:44,162
It resents you more than the husband
and children you gave up to it.

1030
01:35:44,246 --> 01:35:48,704
Why is that, do you think?
Why are you so resented?

1031
01:35:48,787 --> 01:35:51,246
- Tell me.
- Tell you?

1032
01:35:51,329 --> 01:35:52,954
God bless you.

1033
01:35:53,037 --> 01:35:54,912
Well, isn't it clear?

1034
01:35:56,662 --> 01:36:00,079
You serve the idea
of order, Clarice.

1035
01:36:00,162 --> 01:36:01,537
They don't.

1036
01:36:01,621 --> 01:36:05,204
You believe in the oath you took.
They don't.

1037
01:36:05,287 --> 01:36:09,662
You feel it is your duty
to protect the sheep. They don't.

1038
01:36:09,746 --> 01:36:11,871
They don't like you
because you're not like them.

1039
01:36:11,954 --> 01:36:14,162
They hate you and envy you.

1040
01:36:14,246 --> 01:36:17,996
They are weak, unruly
and believe in nothing.

1041
01:36:18,079 --> 01:36:20,621
Mason Verger wants to kill you,
Dr. Lecter.

1042
01:36:20,704 --> 01:36:23,496
Turn yourself in to me,
and I promise no one will hurt you.

1043
01:36:23,537 --> 01:36:27,079
Will you stay with me in my prison cell
and hold my hand, Clarice?

1044
01:36:27,162 --> 01:36:29,496
We could have some fun.

1045
01:36:29,579 --> 01:36:33,037
No, Mason Verger does not want to kill
me any more than I want to kill him.

1046
01:36:33,121 --> 01:36:37,037
He just wants to see me suffer
in some unimaginable way.

1047
01:36:37,121 --> 01:36:39,246
He is rather twisted,
you know.

1048
01:36:39,329 --> 01:36:41,787
Have you had the pleasure
of meeting him?

1049
01:36:41,871 --> 01:36:44,079
Face-to-face, so to speak?

1050
01:36:44,162 --> 01:36:46,079
Yes.

1051
01:36:46,162 --> 01:36:49,287
- Attractive, isn't he?
- Dr. Lecter?

1052
01:36:53,746 --> 01:36:55,746
Okay, back to you.

1053
01:36:55,829 --> 01:36:58,079
I want to know what it is
you think you will do...

1054
01:36:58,162 --> 01:37:01,496
now that everything you've ever cared
about has been taken away from you.

1055
01:37:01,579 --> 01:37:03,996
I don't know, Dr. Lecter.

1056
01:37:04,079 --> 01:37:06,912
Clarice, do you think you'll work
as a chambermaid...

1057
01:37:06,996 --> 01:37:09,746
at a motel on Route 66...

1058
01:37:09,829 --> 01:37:12,537
just like your mommy?

1059
01:37:21,787 --> 01:37:23,871
What are you thinking now?

1060
01:37:23,954 --> 01:37:27,954
Are you paying attention to me,
ex-Special Agent Starling?

1061
01:37:28,829 --> 01:37:32,162
Are you, by any chance,
trying to trace my whereabouts?

1062
01:37:36,204 --> 01:37:39,662
- I'm being followed, Dr. Lecter.
- I know. I've seen them.

1063
01:37:39,746 --> 01:37:42,662
And now you're in
a real dilemma, aren't you?

1064
01:37:42,704 --> 01:37:46,537
Do you continue to try to find me,
knowing that you are leading them to me?

1065
01:37:46,621 --> 01:37:50,246
Do you have so much faith in your
abilities that you honestly believe...

1066
01:37:50,329 --> 01:37:54,162
you can somehow simultaneously
arrest me and them?

1067
01:37:54,246 --> 01:37:58,204
It could get very messy, Clarice,
like the fish market.

1068
01:37:59,912 --> 01:38:02,579
- What if I did it for you?
- Did what?

1069
01:38:02,662 --> 01:38:06,204
Harmed them, Clarice,
the ones who have harmed you.

1070
01:38:06,287 --> 01:38:09,579
What if I made them
scream apologies?

1071
01:38:09,662 --> 01:38:11,662
No, I shouldn't even say it...

1072
01:38:11,746 --> 01:38:15,162
because you'll feel, with your
perfect grasp of right and wrong...

1073
01:38:15,204 --> 01:38:17,454
that you were somehow accompli.

1074
01:38:18,746 --> 01:38:20,246
Don't help me.

1075
01:38:21,746 --> 01:38:23,746
No, of course not.
Forget I said it.

1076
01:38:28,704 --> 01:38:31,496
Clarice, you were very,
very warm.

1077
01:38:31,579 --> 01:38:33,579
You were so close.

1078
01:38:37,787 --> 01:38:40,704
And now you're getting
colder again.

1079
01:38:40,787 --> 01:38:42,996
Yeah, warmer again.

1080
01:38:43,079 --> 01:38:47,246
Well, I think I've been generous
enough with you and the clues.

1081
01:38:47,329 --> 01:38:50,787
- You're on your own now, Clarice.
- Dr. Lecter.

1082
01:39:00,079 --> 01:39:02,787
Hope you like them, Clarice.
Ta-ta.

1083
01:39:32,704 --> 01:39:34,287
Go.

1084
01:39:50,787 --> 01:39:52,704
Get out of the way!

1085
01:40:05,387 --> 01:40:08,262
I know the first thing a hysteric
says is, "I am not a hysteric"...

1086
01:40:08,304 --> 01:40:11,596
but I am not a hysteric.
I am calm.

1087
01:40:11,679 --> 01:40:14,554
I'll ask you one time.
Think before you answer.

1088
01:40:15,804 --> 01:40:18,762
Think about every good thing
you ever did.

1089
01:40:18,846 --> 01:40:20,762
Think about what you swore.

1090
01:40:20,804 --> 01:40:24,096
Two men in a van,
a third driving, another man down.

1091
01:40:24,179 --> 01:40:26,721
They put him in the back.
I think it was Lecter.

1092
01:40:26,804 --> 01:40:30,179
I gave you a license, and I'm reporting
it to you again in front of witnesses.

1093
01:40:32,221 --> 01:40:33,846
All right.

1094
01:40:34,971 --> 01:40:36,971
I'll go with it as a kidnapping.

1095
01:40:37,637 --> 01:40:39,721
I'll send someone
with the local authorities...

1096
01:40:39,804 --> 01:40:42,096
if they'll let us on the property
without a warrant.

1097
01:40:42,179 --> 01:40:46,512
- I should go. You could deputize me.
- No. You're not going.

1098
01:40:46,596 --> 01:40:49,262
You're going home,
where you'll wait for me to call...

1099
01:40:49,346 --> 01:40:53,054
and tell you what,
if anything, we've found.

1100
01:40:54,346 --> 01:40:57,637
Thank Mr. Verger for letting us look
around. Sorry if we inconvenienced him.

1101
01:40:57,721 --> 01:40:59,804
He's always happy to see you.

1102
01:41:09,387 --> 01:41:11,429
Phone.

1103
01:41:11,512 --> 01:41:14,096
What number, please?

1104
01:41:14,179 --> 01:41:15,554
Carlo.

1105
01:41:23,346 --> 01:41:24,887
Give me one.

1106
01:41:29,512 --> 01:41:31,971
- How is he?
- Sleeping.

1107
01:41:32,054 --> 01:41:34,804
Bring him home.

1108
01:41:57,846 --> 01:42:01,304
You've reached Clarice Starling.
Please leave a message.

1109
01:42:01,387 --> 01:42:02,929
Pick up, Starling.

1110
01:42:03,012 --> 01:42:04,971
There was nothing out there.

1111
01:42:05,054 --> 01:42:07,471
I'm gonna say it again,
in case you didn't hear me.

1112
01:42:07,554 --> 01:42:11,471
You are not a law officer while
you're on suspension. You'reJoe Blow.

1113
01:42:12,637 --> 01:42:15,637
Hope for your sake
you're in the bathroom.

1114
01:42:54,762 --> 01:42:56,387
Hylochoerus...

1115
01:42:56,471 --> 01:42:59,637
meinertzhageni.

1116
01:42:59,721 --> 01:43:03,804
Ring any bells from
high school biology, Doctor?

1117
01:43:04,887 --> 01:43:06,804
No?

1118
01:43:06,887 --> 01:43:10,471
Well, I could list
its most conspicuous features...

1119
01:43:10,554 --> 01:43:13,304
if that would help
jog the memory.

1120
01:43:14,054 --> 01:43:16,971
Three pairs of incisors...

1121
01:43:17,054 --> 01:43:21,637
one pair of elongated canines...

1122
01:43:23,137 --> 01:43:26,471
three pairs of molars...

1123
01:43:26,554 --> 01:43:29,096
four pairs of premolars...

1124
01:43:29,179 --> 01:43:31,471
upper and lower...

1125
01:43:31,554 --> 01:43:36,471
for a total of 44 teeth.

1126
01:43:41,262 --> 01:43:46,137
The meal will begin with
an hors d'oeuvres tartare...

1127
01:43:47,596 --> 01:43:50,304
your feet.

1128
01:43:50,387 --> 01:43:52,387
The main course...
the rest of you...

1129
01:43:52,471 --> 01:43:56,137
won't be served
until seven hours later.

1130
01:43:56,221 --> 01:43:58,471
But during that time...

1131
01:43:58,554 --> 01:44:02,971
you'll be able to enjoy the effects
of the consumed appetizer...

1132
01:44:03,054 --> 01:44:06,471
with a full-bodied saline drip.

1133
01:44:08,512 --> 01:44:11,762
I guess you wish now...

1134
01:44:11,846 --> 01:44:14,387
you'd fed the rest of me
to the dogs.

1135
01:44:15,887 --> 01:44:17,887
No, Mason.

1136
01:44:18,512 --> 01:44:21,054
No, I much prefer you
the way you are.

1137
01:44:22,179 --> 01:44:23,679
So...

1138
01:44:25,304 --> 01:44:27,262
dinner at 8:00.

1139
01:44:55,054 --> 01:44:58,679
You will stay
for the evening's entertainment...

1140
01:44:58,762 --> 01:45:00,512
won't you, Cordell?

1141
01:45:00,596 --> 01:45:03,179
If it's all right with you...

1142
01:45:03,262 --> 01:45:06,012
I think I'd rather not.

1143
01:45:06,096 --> 01:45:08,262
Rather not...

1144
01:45:08,346 --> 01:45:11,137
or will not?

1145
01:47:14,846 --> 01:47:18,971
Your little brother must smell
almost as badly as you do by now.

1146
01:47:46,721 --> 01:47:49,054
Hold it!
Hands where I can see 'em!

1147
01:47:53,804 --> 01:47:55,137
Quiet!

1148
01:48:00,721 --> 01:48:03,262
What was that?

1149
01:48:03,346 --> 01:48:04,596
Cordell, quickly!

1150
01:48:04,679 --> 01:48:07,762
Get on your stomach.

1151
01:48:07,846 --> 01:48:09,429
Good evening, Clarice.

1152
01:48:09,512 --> 01:48:12,554
- Just like old times.
- Shut up.

1153
01:48:14,387 --> 01:48:16,637
- Can you walk?
- I can try.

1154
01:48:19,721 --> 01:48:21,221
You look well.

1155
01:48:21,304 --> 01:48:23,346
I'm gonna cut you loose.

1156
01:48:23,429 --> 01:48:26,637
If you touch me,
I'll shoot you.

1157
01:48:26,721 --> 01:48:29,929
- Understood.
- Do right and you'll live through this.

1158
01:48:30,012 --> 01:48:32,971
Spoken like a true Protestant.
Better hurry.

1159
01:48:33,054 --> 01:48:35,471
Things might go faster
if you hand me the knife.

1160
01:48:35,554 --> 01:48:38,012
There was a third
in the loft.

1161
01:48:38,096 --> 01:48:41,637
No, Clarice. Behind me.

1162
01:49:19,387 --> 01:49:23,096
Cordell, shoot him!
Get the gun and shoot him!

1163
01:49:23,179 --> 01:49:25,596
- Go into the pen?
- Yes!

1164
01:49:25,679 --> 01:49:27,929
No. I'm staying out of this.

1165
01:49:28,012 --> 01:49:32,012
You're involved, is what you are,
in all of it. Now do it!

1166
01:49:32,096 --> 01:49:33,137
- No.
- Yes!

1167
01:49:33,221 --> 01:49:36,304
Hey, Cordell,
why don't you push him in?

1168
01:49:36,387 --> 01:49:38,512
You can always say
it was me.

1169
01:51:24,804 --> 01:51:26,387
Mary, it's me.

1170
01:51:26,471 --> 01:51:30,137
I decided to take off early.
I'll be at my lake house all weekend.

1171
01:51:30,221 --> 01:51:32,929
I don't want any calls
forwarded either. Do you understand?

1172
01:51:33,012 --> 01:51:35,762
Whoever it is,
they can all wait. Okay?

1173
01:51:35,846 --> 01:51:39,721
Listen, it's 4th ofJuly,
for Christ's sake. Thank you.

1174
01:51:55,429 --> 01:51:57,387
What the fuck?

1175
01:52:07,471 --> 01:52:09,554
Good. You brought the wine.

1176
01:53:31,762 --> 01:53:36,387
One time I bet a friend I could hold
a lit firecracker in my hand...

1177
01:53:36,471 --> 01:53:38,221
longer than he could.

1178
01:53:38,304 --> 01:53:39,429
Can I guess?

1179
01:53:39,512 --> 01:53:43,429
You lost the bet, and he lost
a finger. Am I right?

1180
01:53:44,554 --> 01:53:46,971
This won't hurt a bit.

1181
01:53:53,179 --> 01:53:55,596
Are we expecting guests?

1182
01:54:27,679 --> 01:54:32,096
We've traced your call and units
will be there in about ten minutes.

1183
01:54:32,179 --> 01:54:35,429
If you can do it safely,
just get out of the house.

1184
01:54:35,512 --> 01:54:38,762
Otherwise,
stay on the phone with me.

1185
01:54:38,846 --> 01:54:40,262
Ma'am?

1186
01:54:40,346 --> 01:54:43,221
Are you there? Ma'am?

1187
01:54:59,429 --> 01:55:01,554
You need to make sure
they feel welcome.

1188
01:55:06,846 --> 01:55:10,512
- Are those shallots?
- And caper berries.

1189
01:55:13,512 --> 01:55:15,512
That butter smells wonderful.

1190
01:55:16,804 --> 01:55:19,012
You feeling hungry, Paul?

1191
01:55:19,096 --> 01:55:21,012
Very.

1192
01:55:26,262 --> 01:55:28,637
What's the main course?

1193
01:55:28,721 --> 01:55:32,262
You should never ask.
It spoils the surprise.

1194
01:55:32,346 --> 01:55:37,179
Clarice, what are you doing up?
You should be resting. Get back to bed.

1195
01:55:37,262 --> 01:55:39,304
I'm hungry.

1196
01:55:41,846 --> 01:55:44,637
- Hello, Paul.
- Paul, don't be rude.

1197
01:55:45,846 --> 01:55:48,846
Say, "Hello, Agent Starling."

1198
01:55:48,929 --> 01:55:52,346
Hello, Agent Starling.

1199
01:55:54,179 --> 01:55:56,179
I always wanted
to watch you eat.

1200
01:55:56,262 --> 01:56:01,346
What have you got in your hand?
Something to bash me on the head with?

1201
01:56:02,179 --> 01:56:04,679
Put it on the table.

1202
01:56:04,762 --> 01:56:06,096
Good girl.

1203
01:56:06,179 --> 01:56:08,429
Hey. That's mine.

1204
01:56:08,512 --> 01:56:10,221
Now sit down.

1205
01:56:12,512 --> 01:56:15,429
Hey, Clarice, love the dress.

1206
01:56:15,512 --> 01:56:17,596
It's beautiful.

1207
01:56:17,679 --> 01:56:19,887
- What do you think, Paul?
- Nice.

1208
01:56:21,012 --> 01:56:22,846
Nice.

1209
01:56:31,012 --> 01:56:34,429
Why don't you say grace, Paul?

1210
01:56:34,512 --> 01:56:36,929
- Me?
- Yeah.

1211
01:56:37,012 --> 01:56:38,679
- Grace?
- Sure.

1212
01:56:39,596 --> 01:56:41,554
Okay.

1213
01:56:41,637 --> 01:56:43,221
Bow your head.

1214
01:56:45,679 --> 01:56:48,596
Father, we thank Thee
for Thy blessings...

1215
01:56:48,679 --> 01:56:50,596
and dedicate them
to Thy mercy...

1216
01:56:50,679 --> 01:56:53,846
We are about to receive...

1217
01:56:53,929 --> 01:56:55,596
Forgive us all...

1218
01:56:55,679 --> 01:56:57,762
even white trash
like Starling here...

1219
01:56:57,846 --> 01:57:00,887
and bring her
into my service, amen.

1220
01:57:02,971 --> 01:57:07,262
I have to tell you, Paul, even the
Apostle Paul couldn't have done better.

1221
01:57:07,346 --> 01:57:09,429
He hated women too.

1222
01:57:09,512 --> 01:57:12,971
- May I have some wine, please?
- I don't think that's a good idea.

1223
01:57:13,054 --> 01:57:14,721
Not with the morphine.

1224
01:57:14,804 --> 01:57:17,262
I think you should
eat some broth. Okay?

1225
01:57:17,346 --> 01:57:22,346
By the way, that was a job offering
I worked into the blessing.

1226
01:57:22,429 --> 01:57:24,429
I'm going to Congress,
you know.

1227
01:57:24,512 --> 01:57:26,221
Are you?

1228
01:57:26,304 --> 01:57:29,096
Come around campaign headquarters.

1229
01:57:29,179 --> 01:57:32,679
You could be an office girl.
Can you type and file?

1230
01:57:32,762 --> 01:57:36,471
Can you take dictation?
Take this down.

1231
01:57:36,554 --> 01:57:40,471
Washington is full
of corn pone, country pussy.

1232
01:57:43,346 --> 01:57:46,096
I took it down.
You said it already.

1233
01:57:46,179 --> 01:57:49,471
Paul, now you're being rude,
and I hate rude people.

1234
01:57:49,554 --> 01:57:52,804
Drink your broth
like a good boy. Come on. Sip.

1235
01:57:54,471 --> 01:57:56,012
Good.

1236
01:57:59,262 --> 01:58:01,846
It's not very good, buddy.

1237
01:58:01,929 --> 01:58:04,887
I admit I added something to yours.
Perhaps it's clashing with the cumin.

1238
01:58:04,971 --> 01:58:08,304
But I assure you,
the next course is to die for.

1239
01:58:20,387 --> 01:58:22,346
Come on, Clarice.

1240
01:58:22,429 --> 01:58:24,512
That's a good girl.

1241
01:58:24,596 --> 01:58:26,179
Good.

1242
01:58:57,429 --> 01:58:58,512
Dr. Lecter.

1243
01:58:58,596 --> 01:59:02,679
You see, the brain itself feels no pain,
Clarice, if that concerns you.

1244
01:59:02,762 --> 01:59:06,512
For example, Paul won't miss
this little piece here...

1245
01:59:06,596 --> 01:59:08,512
part of the prefrontal lobe...

1246
01:59:08,596 --> 01:59:11,679
which they say is
the seat of good manners.

1247
01:59:11,762 --> 01:59:15,471
Your profile at the border stations
has five features.

1248
01:59:15,554 --> 01:59:17,429
- I'll trade you.
- Trade?

1249
01:59:17,512 --> 01:59:22,096
- Stop, and I'll tell you what they are.
- How does that word taste to you?

1250
01:59:22,179 --> 01:59:26,221
Cheap and metallic,
like sucking on a greasy coin?

1251
01:59:26,304 --> 01:59:28,262
- Who's Clarice?
- Agent Starling, Paul.

1252
01:59:28,346 --> 01:59:31,804
If you can't keep up with the
conversation, try not to join in at all.

1253
01:59:31,887 --> 01:59:33,971
Paul, I'm Starling.

1254
01:59:34,054 --> 01:59:35,971
See...

1255
01:59:36,054 --> 01:59:37,971
here...

1256
01:59:38,054 --> 01:59:41,929
right here's the sac
that contains the brain.

1257
01:59:44,262 --> 01:59:46,804
I would really like some wine.

1258
01:59:50,262 --> 01:59:52,679
- That smells great.
- Yes.

1259
01:59:52,762 --> 01:59:55,887
There.
Like to try a little piece?

1260
01:59:55,971 --> 01:59:58,721
I would really like
some wine...

1261
02:00:00,554 --> 02:00:02,512
It is good.

1262
02:00:03,387 --> 02:00:07,054
All right. Just a little.

1263
02:00:08,554 --> 02:00:09,512
Okay?

1264
02:00:26,929 --> 02:00:29,846
Given the chance, you would deny me
my life, wouldn't you?

1265
02:00:31,096 --> 02:00:32,804
Not your life.

1266
02:00:32,887 --> 02:00:35,971
My freedom, just that.
You'd take that from me.

1267
02:00:36,054 --> 02:00:39,429
And if you did, would they have
you back, do you think?

1268
02:00:39,512 --> 02:00:42,054
The FBI?

1269
02:00:42,137 --> 02:00:45,596
Those people you despise almost
as much as they despise you?

1270
02:00:45,679 --> 02:00:48,846
Will they give you a medal,
Clarice, do you think?

1271
02:00:48,929 --> 02:00:52,262
Would you have it professionally framed
and hang it on your wall to look at...

1272
02:00:52,346 --> 02:00:56,762
and remind you of your courage
and incorruptibility?

1273
02:00:59,346 --> 02:01:02,804
All you would need for that,
Clarice, is a mirror.

1274
02:01:04,387 --> 02:01:08,887
I have plans for that smart mouth.
I'm never gonna hire you now.

1275
02:01:13,971 --> 02:01:15,762
Remember what I said?

1276
02:01:15,846 --> 02:01:18,679
If you can't be polite
to our guests...

1277
02:01:18,762 --> 02:01:21,596
you have to sit
at the kiddies' table.

1278
02:01:22,512 --> 02:01:24,762
Don't get up, Clarice.

1279
02:01:24,846 --> 02:01:28,554
Paul will help me clear
and make the coffee.

1280
02:01:30,596 --> 02:01:32,554
Just think about
what I said, Clarice.

1281
02:01:34,804 --> 02:01:36,387
Coffee.

1282
02:02:14,471 --> 02:02:16,929
I came halfway
around the world...

1283
02:02:17,012 --> 02:02:19,429
to watch you run, Clarice.

1284
02:02:21,887 --> 02:02:23,887
Let me run, huh?

1285
02:02:43,012 --> 02:02:47,429
Tell me, Clarice,
would you ever say to me...

1286
02:02:47,512 --> 02:02:49,054
"Stop.

1287
02:02:49,137 --> 02:02:51,137
If you loved me, you'd stop"?

1288
02:02:52,887 --> 02:02:55,137
Not in a thousand years.

1289
02:02:56,679 --> 02:02:58,679
Not in a thousand years.

1290
02:03:04,346 --> 02:03:06,346
That's my girl.

1291
02:03:20,012 --> 02:03:23,679
Now, that's really
interesting, Clarice...

1292
02:03:23,762 --> 02:03:25,762
and I'm really pressed for time.

1293
02:03:25,846 --> 02:03:28,679
So where's the key?

1294
02:03:29,637 --> 02:03:31,637
Where's the key?

1295
02:03:37,387 --> 02:03:38,887
Okay.

1296
02:03:43,846 --> 02:03:45,262
Above...

1297
02:03:45,346 --> 02:03:47,137
or below the wrist...

1298
02:03:47,221 --> 02:03:48,846
Clarice?

1299
02:03:56,429 --> 02:03:59,346
This is really gonna hurt.

1300
02:04:48,012 --> 02:04:50,637
Show me your hands!

1301
02:04:50,721 --> 02:04:53,262
Identify yourself!

1302
02:04:53,346 --> 02:04:55,179
I'm Clarice Starling!

1303
02:04:56,262 --> 02:04:58,221
FBI!

1304
02:05:57,262 --> 02:05:58,971
- Hi.
- Hi.

1305
02:05:59,054 --> 02:06:00,721
What's that?

1306
02:06:02,679 --> 02:06:04,762
That's caviar.

1307
02:06:04,846 --> 02:06:08,096
- What are those?
- These are figs.

1308
02:06:08,179 --> 02:06:10,221
And that?

1309
02:06:12,429 --> 02:06:14,054
This?

1310
02:06:15,429 --> 02:06:17,762
That I don't think
you would like.

1311
02:06:17,846 --> 02:06:20,137
- It looks good.
- Oh, it is good.

1312
02:06:20,221 --> 02:06:21,637
Can I have some?

1313
02:06:23,054 --> 02:06:25,762
You're a very unusual boy,
aren't you?

1314
02:06:25,846 --> 02:06:29,304
- I couldn't eat what they gave me.
- Nor should you. It isn't even food...

1315
02:06:29,387 --> 02:06:33,054
as I understand the definition,
which is why I always bring my own.

1316
02:06:35,554 --> 02:06:37,929
So, which would you like to try?

1317
02:06:42,429 --> 02:06:44,846
Well, I suppose it's all right.

1318
02:06:46,512 --> 02:06:51,429
After all, as your mother tells you,
and my mother certainly told me...

1319
02:06:51,471 --> 02:06:53,971
"It is important,"
she always used to say...

1320
02:06:54,054 --> 02:06:56,929
"always to try new things."

1321
02:06:57,012 --> 02:06:58,429
Open up.

1322
02:11:13,971 --> 02:11:16,554
Ta-ta. "H."
