THE HOURGLASS SANATORIUM

2
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,207
Written by
Based on a novel by

3
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:50,332
Featuring

4
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:53,499
Music

5
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:36,166
Director of photography

6
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:42,041
Directed by

7
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,249
We've almost arrived.

8
00:04:56,917 --> 00:04:58,957
How will I get there?

9
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:05,416
You'll find the way.
You don't need help.

10
00:08:27,792 --> 00:08:31,707
I've come a long way.
I booked a room by telegram.

11
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:33,416
Who can I see?

12
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:39,624
Everybody is sleeping.
I'll tell the doctor when he wakes up.

13
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:43,707
Sleeping?
It's daytime not night.

14
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:52,457
They sleep all the time.
You didn't know?

15
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,624
Night never comes here.

16
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:03,666
You can wait downstairs.

17
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,874
In the restaurant.

18
00:10:56,292 --> 00:10:58,416
The doctor will see you now.

19
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:00,082
Where is he?

20
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,707
We received your telegram yesterday.

21
00:11:20,792 --> 00:11:24,124
We sent our coach to the station.

22
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,082
You must have arrived
on a different train.

23
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,374
The station?

24
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:33,166
We don't have
a good train connection here.

25
00:11:33,417 --> 00:11:35,374
How are you feeling?

26
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,499
Is my father alive?

27
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,624
Of course.

28
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,666
I mean to an extent
allowed by the situation.

29
00:11:53,917 --> 00:11:59,791
You know, just as I do,
that from the perspective

30
00:12:00,042 --> 00:12:05,416
of your home, your country,

31
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:12,541
you father is dead.

32
00:12:15,792 --> 00:12:17,707
This cannot be fully reversed.

33
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:22,666
His death casts a shadow
on his existence here.

34
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:27,791
But he doesn't know or suspect?

35
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,957
Don't worry.

36
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:35,874
Our patients don't suspect anything.

37
00:12:36,917 --> 00:12:38,249
They can't.

38
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:52,082
You probably want to see your father.
I'll take you there.

39
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:03,249
We reserved a bed for you
in his room, as you requested.

40
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:47,874
The trick is that we moved back time.

41
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:57,207
Time is late here by an interval
which I can't precisely define.

42
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:02,957
It all boils down to relativity.

43
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,874
Here, your father's death
hasn't occurred yet.

44
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:18,291
But he met with his death
in your country.

45
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,416
So my father is dead.

46
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:33,124
- Or is close to death.
- You don't understand.

47
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:37,624
We reactivate past time
with all its possibilities.

48
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,166
Including recovery.

49
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:46,249
We let our patients sleep
for a long time.

50
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:49,499
We spare their vital energy.

51
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:53,332
They have nothing better
to do anyway.

52
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,249
Why don't you lie down?

53
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:05,957
There's nothing more
you can do now.

54
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:20,499
Goodbye.

55
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,666
I came to talk to you.

56
00:19:46,792 --> 00:19:48,207
Go on.

57
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:55,291
Why are you spreading lies
and gossip about father?

58
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:59,041
- What lies?
- I know you're behind them.

59
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,457
I didn't lie.

60
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:13,166
You remember how he went
missing for many days.

61
00:20:13,417 --> 00:20:15,291
He avoided us.

62
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:19,791
Who knows whether
he's still alive somewhere?

63
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:25,249
I have to know the truth.

64
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:29,332
Stop tormenting me.
It's hard to communicate with him.

65
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:34,499
How can I cope
with everything myself?

66
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:39,291
How can I answer questions
which God keeps asking me?

67
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:44,541
It's too much for me.
His complaints terrify me.

68
00:20:44,917 --> 00:20:48,374
- Don't cry.
- I have a migraine.

69
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:52,582
You won't go to school today.

70
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:59,707
To school?
Mom, I'm not a little boy anymore.

71
00:21:01,292 --> 00:21:04,707
Yes, you are.
You've got ink on your hands.

72
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:09,832
Your knees are bruised.
You're a naughty, unruly boy.

73
00:21:15,417 --> 00:21:17,791
You hang out
with God knows whom.

74
00:21:18,042 --> 00:21:22,707
Wake those good-for-nothings.
It's time to open the shop.

75
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,499
- But I'm sure...
- Stop tormenting me.

76
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:30,874
I told you that your father
travels around as a salesman.

77
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:35,124
Sometimes
he returns home at night

78
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:39,749
only to go off again before dawn.

79
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:43,166
I'm sure he'll come back.

80
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,874
You're tossing and turning
like fish out of water.

81
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:03,624
- You sleep a bit, doze off a bit...
- Yawn a bit.

82
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:05,916
And you rest again.

83
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:11,791
You should learn wisdom
from an ant, lazybones.

84
00:23:12,542 --> 00:23:15,749
An ant? Go to hell.

85
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:23,166
That ant of yours knows
no teacher, boss or shegetz.

86
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:25,749
And it's doing fine.

87
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,832
What's he talking about?

88
00:23:29,292 --> 00:23:35,082
I walked the fields of a lazy man.

89
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:43,874
I walked the vineyards
of a stupid man.

90
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:47,832
Where is that from?
Our Lord didn't say that.

91
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:49,499
Don't listen to it!

92
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:54,666
Nettles grew over everything.

93
00:23:54,917 --> 00:23:58,541
Thorns covered his land.

94
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:03,249
And the stonewall
collapsed to pieces.

95
00:24:32,542 --> 00:24:35,916
Clap your hands

96
00:24:36,292 --> 00:24:42,707
and call out His name
while rejoicing.

97
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:51,166
Call out his name to the sounds
of songs and trumpets.

98
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:45,957
Praise Him with harps,
praise Him with lyres.

99
00:25:46,292 --> 00:25:49,582
Praise Him with the drums
and dancing.

100
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:53,499
Praise Him with stringed
instruments and horns.

101
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:56,416
Praise Him with the cymbals.

102
00:25:56,667 --> 00:25:59,832
Praise him
with loud clanging cymbals.

103
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:02,832
Let everything that
has breath praise the Lord.

104
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:04,624
Alleluia.

105
00:26:04,958 --> 00:26:07,541
Clap your hands and sing.

106
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,957
Sing.

107
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:13,041
Sing wisely.

108
00:26:34,167 --> 00:26:41,832
In a dream he saw a ladder
that reaches from earth to heaven.

109
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:46,916
And God's angels
were going up and down on it.

110
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,666
Is it possible?

111
00:27:37,917 --> 00:27:42,082
It's our little Józef!

112
00:27:42,792 --> 00:27:47,082
Did you get lost on
your way to school?

113
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,666
Well?

114
00:27:51,792 --> 00:27:54,707
Rascals! They're everywhere.

115
00:27:54,958 --> 00:27:58,791
When I want to go down
to get bread in the morning,

116
00:27:59,042 --> 00:28:02,082
I can't even....

117
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,499
...open the door.

118
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:12,332
They squeeze through cracks.

119
00:28:12,583 --> 00:28:14,874
And try to get into the kitchen.

120
00:28:15,125 --> 00:28:17,124
They ogle me.

121
00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:24,374
They can hardly wag their tails.

122
00:28:33,208 --> 00:28:35,916
They're overjoyed
when they see a fire.

123
00:28:36,167 --> 00:28:39,041
They clap their hands
and dance like savages.

124
00:28:39,292 --> 00:28:42,166
They're hopeless
at putting out fire.

125
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:44,374
But they like to celebrate.

126
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:47,791
- Who are you talking about?
- Those idle firemen.

127
00:28:48,042 --> 00:28:54,957
They get lazy in autumn.
They sleep while standing.

128
00:28:55,583 --> 00:29:00,082
I think you're prejudiced.
They're nice boys.

129
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:21,832
An old stove-fitter told me
that when he repairs chimneys,

130
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:26,332
he finds them attached
to the smoke vent,

131
00:29:26,708 --> 00:29:29,041
motionless like the larvae.

132
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:34,582
They sleep like that being
drunk from raspberryjuice.

133
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:39,124
And they whine in their sleep:
"Sugar, sugar".

134
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:47,499
If I glance at one of them,

135
00:29:47,792 --> 00:29:54,416
his face swells and becomes
obscenely red like a turkey.

136
00:29:55,708 --> 00:29:59,499
I heard that it's a way
of strengthening the inner self.

137
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:04,416
And rejuvenating colours
when firemen eject fireworks,

138
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:07,207
rockets and Bengali lights.

139
00:30:07,708 --> 00:30:09,666
I won't give them
anyjuice anyway.

140
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:15,249
I didn't ruin my complexion
hovering over the stove to make it,

141
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,416
so those rascals could drink it.

142
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:20,291
Unfortunately, Adela,

143
00:30:20,542 --> 00:30:24,749
you never understood things
which go beyond the mundane.

144
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,291
Look.

145
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:37,666
Is it possible to grow hair
to the ground?

146
00:30:43,083 --> 00:30:47,457
You look so different.
Just wonderful!

147
00:30:47,875 --> 00:30:49,916
The captain of rascals!

148
00:30:52,958 --> 00:30:57,541
"I, Anna Csillag, born in Moravia,
had poor hair growth".

149
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:00,291
I wish I had hair like that.

150
00:31:03,042 --> 00:31:05,541
Would you like some water?

151
00:31:07,292 --> 00:31:10,416
- With raspberryjuice.
- No, thanks.

152
00:31:10,917 --> 00:31:12,374
Too bad.

153
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:19,166
Her poor hair growth
was divine retribution.

154
00:31:19,417 --> 00:31:23,749
But prayers and penance
took the curse off her.

155
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,832
She was graced with enlightenment.

156
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:33,999
She received signs
and made this miraculous remedy.

157
00:31:35,167 --> 00:31:36,749
Look.

158
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:44,166
These are her brothers,
cousins and brothers-in-law.

159
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,707
Who's he?

160
00:31:46,958 --> 00:31:52,582
Another brother-in-law.
She made a whole town happy.

161
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,416
Really?

162
00:32:01,625 --> 00:32:03,999
"Elsa. The fluid with a swan".

163
00:32:04,917 --> 00:32:10,332
It's a balm for all afflictions.
It works wonders.

164
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:12,624
Where did you get this book?

165
00:32:12,875 --> 00:32:17,499
It's been here all the time,
scattered around.

166
00:32:20,833 --> 00:32:24,332
"Smoke all you want".
"Sexual Neurasthenia".

167
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:26,207
"Gramophones".

168
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,624
You silly thing.

169
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:34,666
We use its pages to wrap meat
and your father's lunch.

170
00:32:41,875 --> 00:32:45,457
It's degradation of an original book.

171
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:07,374
You're late.
There's no more juice.

172
00:33:07,625 --> 00:33:11,332
I have some rose preserve.
It's not bad.

173
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,499
Adela!

174
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:17,291
- Try it.
- Thank you.

175
00:33:18,917 --> 00:33:22,957
- It's not a preserve.
- So what? It tastes sweet.

176
00:33:29,292 --> 00:33:30,707
Is your name Jakub?

177
00:33:32,208 --> 00:33:35,791
No, I'm Józef.
Jakub is my father.

178
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:39,041
I see.

179
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:46,624
Can you come out?
We can't talk like this.

180
00:33:48,417 --> 00:33:51,332
- Excuse me.
- It's all right.

181
00:34:04,708 --> 00:34:09,541
I have a valuable delivery.
Where can I find your father?

182
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,957
I'm looking for him myself.

183
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:16,791
Allow me to introduce
Honduras and Nicaragua.

184
00:34:17,042 --> 00:34:18,707
Come closer.

185
00:34:26,167 --> 00:34:27,457
It's spotted.

186
00:34:27,708 --> 00:34:31,582
That's right.
It's perishable.

187
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:35,499
- Birds of paradise?
- Not only.

188
00:34:35,792 --> 00:34:39,749
For hatching, it's best to let
Belgian hens sit on them.

189
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,124
Or you can do it yourself.

190
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:48,082
I think I see your father.

191
00:34:50,542 --> 00:34:51,999
Over there!

192
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,166
Don't you think he's behaving
in a strange way?

193
00:34:59,917 --> 00:35:01,666
He's demonstrating.

194
00:35:40,708 --> 00:35:42,124
Father!

195
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,332
Father...

196
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:50,541
You should beware of things
like narrow-mindedness,

197
00:35:50,792 --> 00:35:54,457
pedantry and blind literalism.

198
00:35:54,708 --> 00:35:59,499
Have you noticed that
in some books flocks of swallows

199
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:04,499
are flying between the verses?
Stanzas of swallows.

200
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:08,499
You should learn to read
from the flight of these birds.

201
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:12,332
Father. I have to tell you something.

202
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:14,582
It's a secret.
I found an original.

203
00:36:14,833 --> 00:36:16,582
- An original?
- Yes.

204
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,499
Look.

205
00:36:21,292 --> 00:36:24,582
It's worthless!

206
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:26,166
It's a book!

207
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:28,707
It's just a myth.

208
00:36:28,958 --> 00:36:32,207
A book is a myth
we believe in when we're young.

209
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:36,916
We stop treating it seriously
as we get older.

210
00:36:37,292 --> 00:36:44,207
Books live a borrowed life.

211
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,957
Every book has a moment

212
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:52,249
when it soars into the air like

213
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,832
a phoenix with its pages on fire!

214
00:36:57,833 --> 00:36:59,207
Look.

215
00:37:07,583 --> 00:37:13,207
We love them for that moment.

216
00:37:13,458 --> 00:37:17,916
But they turn to ashes.

217
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:19,541
Thank you.

218
00:37:20,208 --> 00:37:25,832
Why doesn't anybody
offer goldfinch?

219
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:30,166
Where?

220
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,374
A book is a myth, my son.

221
00:37:48,792 --> 00:37:51,916
It soars into the air
like a phoenix.

222
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:13,207
Hyderabad.

223
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,874
Guatemala.

224
00:38:16,542 --> 00:38:19,541
Tasmania, San Domingo.

225
00:38:20,542 --> 00:38:22,166
Sierra Leone.

226
00:38:24,542 --> 00:38:29,332
Labrador, Barbados,
Trinidad, El Salvador,

227
00:38:29,583 --> 00:38:32,291
Borneo, Sumatra, Pernambuco.

228
00:38:34,042 --> 00:38:35,666
Hiporabundia.

229
00:38:35,917 --> 00:38:37,957
You're talking nonsense.

230
00:38:38,208 --> 00:38:40,791
You could say Panfibras.

231
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:47,124
Haleiwa, Abracadabra.

232
00:38:51,583 --> 00:38:55,916
Why do I get the feeling
that I've been there before?

233
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,749
A long time ago.

234
00:38:59,125 --> 00:39:05,166
What if we know all landscapes
that we come across in life?

235
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,957
Can anything new happen?

236
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,124
Something we can't sense?

237
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:52,832
Do you hear me?

238
00:39:55,167 --> 00:39:58,707
I want to know if all this
could have happened.

239
00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:01,624
Answer me.

240
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:05,124
Did it happen or not?

241
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:09,749
Yes and no.

242
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:15,041
There are some things
that can't fully happen.

243
00:40:15,292 --> 00:40:21,624
They are too grand and magnificent
to fit into an event.

244
00:40:21,875 --> 00:40:25,957
Theyjust try to happen.

245
00:40:26,208 --> 00:40:29,791
Tell me if they really exist.

246
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:05,916
She did exist.

247
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:10,457
And nothing can
take away my certainty.

248
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:11,416
Don't be afraid.
She can't hear us.

249
00:42:12,625 --> 00:42:15,707
It's my dead mother,
she lives here.

250
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:22,082
She's inhabited by ghosts,
phantoms, larvae and chrysalises.

251
00:42:26,958 --> 00:42:28,707
Helpless and naive,

252
00:42:28,958 --> 00:42:32,749
she takes them into her dream
and sleeps with them.

253
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,207
She wakes up half-conscious
at dawn and remembers nothing.

254
00:42:37,458 --> 00:42:39,499
That's why she's so sad.

255
00:42:40,042 --> 00:42:43,749
She has to live so many lives.

256
00:42:46,167 --> 00:42:49,666
Do you know a story
that time cannot change?

257
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:55,499
There is one that
you haven't heard.

258
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:59,332
It belongs to the night.

259
00:42:59,583 --> 00:43:03,124
Will you find the patience
to listen to it?

260
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:08,666
Somebody will walk
across the sky,

261
00:43:08,917 --> 00:43:11,499
cuddling a baby in a coat.

262
00:43:12,542 --> 00:43:16,249
Constantly on the way,
on a endless journey.

263
00:43:17,125 --> 00:43:20,041
He'll pass us with long steps.

264
00:43:20,833 --> 00:43:23,124
That's what's going to happen.

265
00:43:23,375 --> 00:43:27,874
Over and over again.

266
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:36,749
Bianca, you can count on me!
Till the last drop of blood!

267
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:45,582
Well?

268
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:49,124
It's a riddle.

269
00:43:49,875 --> 00:43:51,332
What about her?

270
00:43:51,583 --> 00:43:56,041
She's all grey.

271
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,249
The touch of her hand must
be beyond imagination.

272
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,666
What did you see there?

273
00:44:05,292 --> 00:44:09,124
Something colourful,
colonial terrifying.

274
00:44:10,125 --> 00:44:13,874
Abductions, pursuits, betrayals.

275
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:18,916
It's a story about an abducted
and switched princess.

276
00:44:19,167 --> 00:44:21,124
You're making it up.

277
00:44:24,833 --> 00:44:26,207
Java.

278
00:44:27,125 --> 00:44:28,457
Sumatra.

279
00:44:28,917 --> 00:44:30,249
Borneo.

280
00:44:31,042 --> 00:44:35,916
I can appoint you as coregent.
Anonymously.

281
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,874
Together with the stamp album
we'll form a triumvirate.

282
00:44:40,125 --> 00:44:44,541
We'll be responsible
for this unsolved affair.

283
00:44:45,125 --> 00:44:47,541
With the stamp album?

284
00:44:47,792 --> 00:44:51,666
What a naive question.
It's a universal book.

285
00:44:51,917 --> 00:44:54,999
A compendium of knowledge
about human life containing

286
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:57,291
allusions and understatements.

287
00:44:57,542 --> 00:45:04,207
This story will be interspersed
with dashes, ellipses and sighs.

288
00:45:05,458 --> 00:45:08,707
It requires a bit of intelligence
and imagination.

289
00:45:08,958 --> 00:45:12,707
Your words are delirious,
ridiculous, insane.

290
00:45:12,958 --> 00:45:17,707
I was fond of you, Rudolf,
because you own this album.

291
00:45:17,958 --> 00:45:21,457
Now your outbursts of
envy put me off.

292
00:45:23,042 --> 00:45:26,207
Don't forget that you're
dependent on me.

293
00:45:29,333 --> 00:45:31,957
I have to get to the other side.

294
00:45:46,375 --> 00:45:50,624
I know.
Her father is a ship's doctor.

295
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:54,082
A small steam boat
with wheels at the sides

296
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:57,457
is waiting for her
every night at the pier.

297
00:45:57,708 --> 00:45:59,332
It's lights are off.

298
00:45:59,583 --> 00:46:02,249
Don't go there.
I have a bad feeling.

299
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,999
Don't worry. I may seem excited,
but I have my fears.

300
00:46:08,333 --> 00:46:11,332
Won't it be safer to look through
the stamp album?

301
00:46:11,583 --> 00:46:14,082
You haven't seen New Mexico.

302
00:46:14,333 --> 00:46:18,207
Remember that there
is no final Mexico.

303
00:46:18,458 --> 00:46:20,832
Behind every Mexico
there is a new one.

304
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:08,041
They only seem dead.

305
00:49:09,083 --> 00:49:13,041
The don't have to breathe
for a longer period.

306
00:49:13,292 --> 00:49:16,791
These villains won't be
characters in novels.

307
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:21,207
They're just a makeshift creation,
a one-time thing.

308
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,207
They were caught at a moment
when their obsession,

309
00:49:26,458 --> 00:49:28,541
their madness was real.

310
00:49:28,792 --> 00:49:34,582
Skilfully prepared, it became
the core of their new existence.

311
00:49:36,417 --> 00:49:43,166
A new man was created
in the image of a mannequin.

312
00:49:44,583 --> 00:49:49,332
This is anarchist Luccheni,
assassin of Empress Elisabeth.

313
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:07,624
And this is Draga,
the demonic Queen of Serbia.

314
00:50:08,667 --> 00:50:11,082
Edison and Bismarck.

315
00:50:11,792 --> 00:50:13,707
"Leatherstocking".

316
00:50:15,458 --> 00:50:20,457
This is a young genius,
the pride and hope of his family.

317
00:50:20,708 --> 00:50:23,707
Addiction to masturbation
ruined his life.

318
00:50:23,958 --> 00:50:27,207
Unfortunately, they're not authentic.

319
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:34,374
But we put a lot of effort
into making them look good.

320
00:50:34,625 --> 00:50:37,707
Their faces are pale,

321
00:50:37,958 --> 00:50:41,666
flushed from
the illness they died of.

322
00:50:46,083 --> 00:50:51,374
Now take a look at
Emperor Franz Joseph.

323
00:50:52,417 --> 00:50:57,749
Wrinkles on his face make him
look like he's smiling.

324
00:50:58,042 --> 00:51:01,457
But when you come closer,
you see that

325
00:51:01,708 --> 00:51:04,832
his smile is just a grimace
of bitterness and terseness.

326
00:51:05,125 --> 00:51:07,749
He had a younger brother,

327
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,082
so different spiritually
and ideologically.

328
00:51:11,333 --> 00:51:16,124
This unfortunate antagonist,
disadvantaged by birth,

329
00:51:16,542 --> 00:51:20,582
was Archduke Maximilian.

330
00:51:22,042 --> 00:51:27,582
The emperor loved him secretly,
but planned to get rid of him.

331
00:51:27,833 --> 00:51:32,832
He appointed him commander
of the Levantine Ship Squadron,

332
00:51:33,083 --> 00:51:34,957
hoping that he'd go under.

333
00:51:35,208 --> 00:51:40,499
Later he signed a secret alliance
with Napoleon III.

334
00:51:41,167 --> 00:51:42,457
That's him.

335
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:51,416
He used deception to involve
Maximilian in the Mexican incident.

336
00:51:51,667 --> 00:51:58,499
This creative young man
renounced his Habsburg title

337
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:02,749
only to ride aboard
the French liner "Le Cid"

338
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,499
right into a trap.

339
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:11,916
Some sources say
he was just a cousin.

340
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:16,041
Others that he was never born.

341
00:52:16,292 --> 00:52:20,041
He was conjectured from the fears
and hallucinations the emperor

342
00:52:20,292 --> 00:52:23,124
experienced while sleeping.

343
00:52:23,667 --> 00:52:28,124
We had problems putting
him back together

344
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:32,291
after his execution in Vera Cruz.

345
00:52:32,542 --> 00:52:36,541
Unfortunately,
he still suffers from amnesia.

346
00:52:36,792 --> 00:52:40,957
I had to teach him everything
about his life again.

347
00:52:41,208 --> 00:52:45,166
My only success is that
at the sound of the name

348
00:52:45,833 --> 00:52:52,082
of Emperor Franz Joseph
he draws his sword.

349
00:52:59,125 --> 00:53:02,916
He wounded Victor Emmanuel.

350
00:53:03,958 --> 00:53:08,499
The latter didn't manage to get out
of his way quickly enough.

351
00:53:17,833 --> 00:53:19,249
Bianca...

352
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,082
and Maximilian?

353
00:53:40,875 --> 00:53:43,124
It's a simple mechanical trick.

354
00:53:43,375 --> 00:53:46,707
When wound up he moves
and acts like a live person.

355
00:54:31,125 --> 00:54:34,707
A simple mechanical trick,
my foot!

356
00:54:34,958 --> 00:54:36,874
A cynic in the tropics.

357
00:54:37,125 --> 00:54:39,416
No, a tropical cynic.

358
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:44,374
And Rudolf said I exaggerated
and made things up.

359
00:54:47,375 --> 00:54:51,874
They should take their medicine
and be in bed by now.

360
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:56,207
It's not good to keep them
on stands for so long.

361
00:54:59,083 --> 00:55:00,957
I can smell curare.

362
00:55:02,792 --> 00:55:08,374
Would you like to see
my collection of weapons?

363
00:55:08,792 --> 00:55:12,249
So my intuition was right after all.

364
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:15,166
Under the cover of law
and order hair-rising things

365
00:55:15,417 --> 00:55:17,332
are happening here.

366
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:21,916
Will you tell me who Bianca is?

367
00:55:27,375 --> 00:55:29,541
Her mother was a Creole.

368
00:55:29,792 --> 00:55:32,957
Archduke Maximilian called her
lovingly Conchita.

369
00:55:33,208 --> 00:55:38,457
She went down in history under
that name, through the back door.

370
00:55:38,708 --> 00:55:40,832
Her mother?
You mean grandmother?

371
00:55:41,667 --> 00:55:42,999
Mother.

372
00:55:43,792 --> 00:55:48,999
After Maximilian's downfall,
she took her daughter to Paris.

373
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:51,707
She lived on a widow's pension.

374
00:55:51,958 --> 00:55:56,916
That's where history loses track
of our touching character.

375
00:55:57,167 --> 00:56:00,124
Allow me to finish for you.

376
00:56:00,375 --> 00:56:02,999
It's confidential!

377
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:06,957
Keep calm and control yourself.

378
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:18,749
100,000 pesos.

379
00:56:21,083 --> 00:56:26,749
My business is not going well.
It's an expensive project.

380
00:56:28,125 --> 00:56:33,416
In 1900 a Mrs. de V,
a woman of exotic beauty,

381
00:56:33,667 --> 00:56:38,374
leaves France and goes to Austria
with her daughter and husband,

382
00:56:38,625 --> 00:56:39,957
having fake passports.

383
00:56:40,208 --> 00:56:45,874
They get arrested in Salzburg,
while changing trains to Vienna.

384
00:56:46,167 --> 00:56:52,124
After checking his fake passport,
Mr. de V is free to go.

385
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:55,957
But he does nothing to get
his wife and daughter released.

386
00:56:56,208 --> 00:57:02,041
That very day he goes back
to France and is never seen again.

387
00:57:02,292 --> 00:57:06,999
I will be the one to identify him.

388
00:57:13,917 --> 00:57:16,541
150,000 pesos.

389
00:57:17,917 --> 00:57:22,041
You're so uncompromising.
What do you want?

390
00:57:22,292 --> 00:57:27,291
Your decisions will show
if you're aware of the situation.

391
00:57:27,542 --> 00:57:30,916
- I want facts!
- Stop!

392
00:57:37,583 --> 00:57:42,207
I think Bianca's origin
has been confirmed.

393
01:00:06,667 --> 01:00:10,249
Negroes!
Hordes of Negroes!

394
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:12,582
Negroes at this time of the year?

395
01:00:12,833 --> 01:00:16,374
The barometer
must be at its lowest point.

396
01:00:16,875 --> 01:00:18,416
Bianca?

397
01:00:20,625 --> 01:00:23,249
I thought you'd never get here.

398
01:00:23,583 --> 01:00:26,999
- Sit down.
- No, infanta.

399
01:00:27,667 --> 01:00:30,749
I have to do duties
which fate has assigned to me.

400
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,124
I have to carry out my plan.

401
01:00:33,375 --> 01:00:35,874
Did you bring anything to read?

402
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:42,124
Decrees. Sign them.

403
01:00:49,417 --> 01:00:54,374
"Daisy, Daisy give me your answer".
Barrel organs everywhere!

404
01:00:59,417 --> 01:01:03,166
Real marvels of technology.
They may come in handy.

405
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:09,124
Things went so far that

406
01:01:09,375 --> 01:01:14,332
I got involved in the dynastic
affairs of great monarchs.

407
01:01:14,583 --> 01:01:16,291
I think we're in trouble.

408
01:01:16,542 --> 01:01:18,416
Let's think about betrayal.

409
01:01:18,667 --> 01:01:20,332
- Betrayal?
- Yes.

410
01:01:20,583 --> 01:01:22,957
- Betrayal?
- That's right.

411
01:01:23,208 --> 01:01:25,499
Do you have a better idea?

412
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:27,541
I don't understand.

413
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,832
It must be a wonderful feeling.

414
01:01:35,542 --> 01:01:38,791
To penetrate the depths
of villainy and erase oneself

415
01:01:39,042 --> 01:01:40,791
from one's own memory.

416
01:01:42,542 --> 01:01:50,457
Wouldn't you like to be defiled
or repulsive for a moment?

417
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:53,291
But totally renewed.

418
01:01:54,667 --> 01:01:59,166
Do it.
You'll become one of them.

419
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,207
One of those black Negroes.

420
01:02:02,458 --> 01:02:07,999
Now that things are at the final
stage you want me to betray?

421
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:14,499
You're ridiculous with your
faithfulness and sense of mission!

422
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:17,582
- What if I chose Rudolf?
- No.

423
01:02:17,833 --> 01:02:22,291
I prefer him a thousand times
over you, a boring pedant.

424
01:02:23,208 --> 01:02:25,082
He would be obedient.

425
01:02:25,583 --> 01:02:29,916
Even when it came to crime
or self-destruction.

426
01:02:30,167 --> 01:02:31,832
Rudolf obedient?

427
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:35,416
Do you remember Lonka,
the washerwoman's daughter?

428
01:02:35,667 --> 01:02:37,582
You played with her
when you were a little boy.

429
01:02:37,833 --> 01:02:40,041
- Yes.
- It was me.

430
01:02:40,375 --> 01:02:42,457
Only I was a boy at that time.

431
01:02:42,708 --> 01:02:44,291
Did you like me then?

432
01:02:44,542 --> 01:02:49,082
Bianca, I feel everything
is going the wrong way.

433
01:02:49,333 --> 01:02:50,874
Must you disappoint me?

434
01:02:51,125 --> 01:02:53,582
May I see your tickets, please?

435
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:02,332
Conductor...

436
01:03:02,583 --> 01:03:06,624
What is going on here?

437
01:03:06,875 --> 01:03:10,124
Take it easy. Don't panic.

438
01:03:10,375 --> 01:03:14,541
We'll fix everything quietly.
We don't need help.

439
01:03:14,792 --> 01:03:18,374
Normal facts are arranged in time.

440
01:03:18,625 --> 01:03:21,166
They are threaded on it...

441
01:03:22,583 --> 01:03:25,041
...like onto a string.

442
01:03:25,292 --> 01:03:28,832
It's important for
narration and continuity.

443
01:03:29,083 --> 01:03:31,582
Fine.

444
01:03:32,583 --> 01:03:38,249
What about events
which have no place in time?

445
01:03:39,167 --> 01:03:43,999
Events which
have occurred too late,

446
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:46,332
when time has been allocated?

447
01:03:46,583 --> 01:03:50,624
Is time too tight
to take in all events?

448
01:03:50,875 --> 01:03:55,374
Time has its side offshoots,
somewhat illegal and dubious.

449
01:03:55,625 --> 01:03:57,666
But we can't be too fussy

450
01:03:57,917 --> 01:04:02,541
when dealing with events
that cannot be classified.

451
01:04:03,083 --> 01:04:09,582
Who knows? Maybe all the dirty
manipulation is behind us.

452
01:04:09,833 --> 01:04:14,582
We're heading to a dead end.

453
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:18,249
Exactly.

454
01:04:20,208 --> 01:04:22,624
How can I get out of here?

455
01:04:24,542 --> 01:04:28,916
Why don't you try going
under the bed again?

456
01:04:32,208 --> 01:04:36,166
- Excuse me, I have to go.
- Coward!

457
01:04:36,417 --> 01:04:38,916
I hope to come back again.

458
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,374
Coward!

459
01:04:44,917 --> 01:04:47,457
Stupid coward.

460
01:05:32,292 --> 01:05:33,749
It's you.

461
01:05:42,083 --> 01:05:44,374
You don't look well.

462
01:05:44,625 --> 01:05:48,666
Everything is mixed up, father.

463
01:05:49,458 --> 01:05:50,999
Father?

464
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:57,291
It takes a lot of patience to find
the right words in this confusion.

465
01:05:57,542 --> 01:06:04,499
You can do it by grammatical
analysis of sentences and tenses.

466
01:06:05,333 --> 01:06:09,332
What? I don't remember.

467
01:06:10,625 --> 01:06:12,916
I am, he is, she is...

468
01:06:13,167 --> 01:06:14,457
I've got it!

469
01:06:15,125 --> 01:06:16,791
You are, we are!

470
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:21,124
They are...

471
01:06:26,458 --> 01:06:31,582
You need to eliminate
flirtatious chatter of birds,

472
01:06:34,333 --> 01:06:41,416
their pointed adverbs, prepositions,

473
01:06:41,667 --> 01:06:48,082
and timid personal pronouns
to find a healthy grain of time.

474
01:07:15,417 --> 01:07:23,166
Legend books,
unwritten books, great epics,

475
01:07:23,958 --> 01:07:27,999
pallid and monotonous
nameless novels,

476
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:33,207
faceless giants,
dark evening stories,

477
01:07:33,458 --> 01:07:39,249
cloudy dramas,
errant and lost books.

478
01:08:44,375 --> 01:08:46,499
You must have a lot of work.

479
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:50,499
The light on in your room
late at night.

480
01:08:51,167 --> 01:08:53,582
Try. See if you can do it.

481
01:09:12,042 --> 01:09:14,124
Fascinating!

482
01:09:14,375 --> 01:09:18,541
What a beauty!

483
01:09:19,083 --> 01:09:25,582
Remember. Paradisea apoda
or the bird of paradise.

484
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,624
Cardinalis cardinalis!

485
01:09:32,208 --> 01:09:34,374
Chrysolophus pictus.

486
01:09:36,292 --> 01:09:37,832
Upupa epops.

487
01:09:41,667 --> 01:09:46,082
I want you to take
something with you.

488
01:09:46,583 --> 01:09:49,207
Anything, at least a tiny bit.

489
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:55,457
Get it into your blood,
your life and save it.

490
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,832
And live with it.

491
01:10:05,125 --> 01:10:09,082
Come in!

492
01:10:10,875 --> 01:10:13,082
Go now.
They're looking for you.

493
01:10:13,333 --> 01:10:16,791
I don't want to be disturbed.
Go.

494
01:10:25,375 --> 01:10:38,999
Go!

495
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,707
Look at you.

496
01:11:24,917 --> 01:11:27,166
You're covered in cobwebs.

497
01:11:28,125 --> 01:11:30,332
You ripped your coat.

498
01:11:31,083 --> 01:11:33,374
You've been in the attic again.

499
01:11:43,292 --> 01:11:46,582
Shop assistants steal from us,
people buy on credit only,

500
01:11:46,833 --> 01:11:49,082
and you just play around.

501
01:11:49,625 --> 01:11:53,332
Take it to the shop.
Your father must be hungry.

502
01:12:08,167 --> 01:12:09,957
The shop!

503
01:13:16,375 --> 01:13:18,291
They're looking for you.

504
01:13:18,542 --> 01:13:19,916
It's hot.

505
01:13:21,458 --> 01:13:23,457
Who?

506
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:26,999
The shop assistants,
especially Teodor.

507
01:13:27,250 --> 01:13:32,582
I know. They'll be climbing
the ladder up and down.

508
01:13:35,583 --> 01:13:37,499
Up and down.

509
01:13:59,667 --> 01:14:01,249
Józef!

510
01:14:04,208 --> 01:14:07,957
I wish you
had been born earlier.

511
01:14:21,208 --> 01:14:22,624
Come!

512
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:42,624
Take it to them.
It'll scare them.

513
01:14:44,792 --> 01:14:48,124
Adela, Holofernes was a man.

514
01:14:48,625 --> 01:14:53,332
Whatever. I kept her in borsch
to make her look better.

515
01:15:10,417 --> 01:15:12,041
I'll buy it.

516
01:15:16,375 --> 01:15:18,416
Lay off. It's not for sale.

517
01:15:18,667 --> 01:15:22,999
What? The head is in a shop,
so it's for sale.

518
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:24,749
I'll buy it.

519
01:16:01,125 --> 01:16:02,499
Father!

520
01:16:04,458 --> 01:16:08,082
Take it away.
There's no room here.

521
01:16:11,625 --> 01:16:14,582
Stop bothering me.
I'm busy.

522
01:16:30,875 --> 01:16:34,457
Jakub! Go on, trade!

523
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:05,249
Father!

524
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,624
Wake up, Józef.

525
01:17:52,875 --> 01:17:56,832
I know you're exhausted.
It's only a few steps more.

526
01:17:57,333 --> 01:18:01,457
Father, you're ill. You should
take care of yourself.

527
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,249
Can you hear him?
He's coming.

528
01:18:06,417 --> 01:18:10,166
I know him since childhood.
We went to school together.

529
01:18:10,417 --> 01:18:18,499
That egoist disgusted me.
He devoured lots of buttered rolls.

530
01:18:19,292 --> 01:18:23,791
Go and meet him.
He'll think I ignore him.

531
01:18:25,917 --> 01:18:28,374
Go!

532
01:19:19,792 --> 01:19:23,832
If I'm not mistaken it's Józef,
Jakub's son.

533
01:19:24,083 --> 01:19:27,749
May the sky over your heads
always be blue,

534
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,499
and the ground under
your feet moist with dew.

535
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:32,916
I don't think I need to say that.

536
01:19:33,167 --> 01:19:36,916
You can hear their shop
is as busy as a beehive.

537
01:19:39,458 --> 01:19:43,249
It's just appearances
and pitiful mystification.

538
01:19:44,583 --> 01:19:46,874
Mother complains
that people buy on credit only.

539
01:19:47,708 --> 01:19:49,957
- What did he say?
- Credit.

540
01:19:51,292 --> 01:19:54,291
- I must have misheard.
- I could have expected it.

541
01:19:54,542 --> 01:19:58,249
- They sell on credit.
- Enough! I don't want to hear it.

542
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:00,124
Why do you keep bowing?

543
01:20:03,167 --> 01:20:06,957
Turn your ear and listen
to the words of the wise.

544
01:20:07,208 --> 01:20:09,791
Apply your heart to my teaching.

545
01:20:10,042 --> 01:20:11,916
I sold for cash.

546
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:17,666
Help our fellow man
as much as we can,

547
01:20:17,917 --> 01:20:21,541
but be vigilant
we don't fall ourselves.

548
01:20:36,417 --> 01:20:40,916
The seven years of plenty
will come to this land.

549
01:20:41,542 --> 01:20:48,457
It was Christian Seipel and Sons,
owners of weaving mills.

550
01:20:49,042 --> 01:20:53,041
The rich man laboured
in gathering riches,

551
01:20:53,542 --> 01:20:58,124
and when he rests he shall
be filled with his goods.

552
01:21:00,125 --> 01:21:04,916
The poor man laboured
in his low way of life,

553
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:08,332
and in the end he is still poor.

554
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:30,999
Come.

555
01:26:02,792 --> 01:26:05,207
She doesn't show up
in the park anymore.

556
01:26:05,458 --> 01:26:09,457
They must be guarding her.
They smelled danger.

557
01:26:09,708 --> 01:26:11,957
It's nothing but humbug!

558
01:26:12,208 --> 01:26:15,957
Extraterritoriality! Mexico!
Maximilian! Cotton plantations!

559
01:26:16,208 --> 01:26:21,457
Enough!
Who told you that?

560
01:26:21,708 --> 01:26:25,499
The files of this secret conspiracy
were never revealed.

561
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:29,499
I'm the owner of
this stamp album.

562
01:26:30,083 --> 01:26:33,291
I won't lend it to you again
for such purposes.

563
01:26:33,542 --> 01:26:37,374
I must admit that
the whole thing is incredible.

564
01:26:37,958 --> 01:26:39,791
Unbelievable.

565
01:26:40,042 --> 01:26:42,457
What do you think, Rudolf?

566
01:26:42,708 --> 01:26:47,166
Who could have conceived
such an evil idea,

567
01:26:47,417 --> 01:26:50,582
which goes beyond any fantasy?

568
01:26:56,083 --> 01:26:58,541
I'm amazed myself.

569
01:27:02,458 --> 01:27:04,916
Tittle-tattle!
Our partnership is over!

570
01:27:05,167 --> 01:27:06,874
Suit yourself.

571
01:27:07,125 --> 01:27:11,624
I said I would prove
that it was all true.

572
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:38,332
- Where is Mr. de V?
- He's left.

573
01:27:40,250 --> 01:27:43,416
We'll see.
Where is the infanta?

574
01:27:45,250 --> 01:27:49,041
Her Highness has left too.
Nobody is here.

575
01:27:49,292 --> 01:27:51,332
Right. Get out.

576
01:27:59,583 --> 01:28:01,791
Somebody must have
betrayed me.

577
01:28:11,875 --> 01:28:13,624
Abra...

578
01:28:15,792 --> 01:28:17,374
Abra?

579
01:28:18,167 --> 01:28:20,041
Abracadabra.

580
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,457
Great.

581
01:28:22,708 --> 01:28:26,374
Come on. Get up!

582
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:31,041
Haleiwa!

583
01:28:35,333 --> 01:28:36,624
Vienna!

584
01:28:52,417 --> 01:28:54,416
Bravo!

585
01:28:54,917 --> 01:28:58,041
Mount your horses, gentlemen!

586
01:29:00,875 --> 01:29:02,249
Haleiwa!

587
01:29:04,708 --> 01:29:08,749
- What's going on here?
- This way, Your Highness.

588
01:29:29,208 --> 01:29:30,957
Forward!

589
01:30:18,083 --> 01:30:21,666
Gentlemen,
I troubled you in vain.

590
01:30:22,417 --> 01:30:26,832
These people are free to go.
Don't harm them.

591
01:30:27,833 --> 01:30:31,957
In my blindness I wanted
to preach the scripture,

592
01:30:32,208 --> 01:30:34,249
to interpret God's will.

593
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:38,624
My false belief made me
pursue obscure clues

594
01:30:38,875 --> 01:30:41,749
and make random conclusions.

595
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,582
Allow me, my friend.

596
01:30:43,833 --> 01:30:48,082
Noble gentlemen and you, infanta.

597
01:30:48,333 --> 01:30:50,499
I hand the regency to Rudolf.

598
01:30:51,417 --> 01:30:52,957
I abdicate!

599
01:30:57,583 --> 01:31:00,041
You're free, noble gentlemen.

600
01:31:00,292 --> 01:31:03,666
Thank you in the name
of our idea.

601
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:11,332
Our dethroned idea, which...

602
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:18,124
Hurry!

603
01:31:28,708 --> 01:31:31,082
Father!

604
01:31:31,333 --> 01:31:34,707
Call Garibaldi.
He's an expert on wounds.

605
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:36,957
Bianca.

606
01:31:40,917 --> 01:31:42,582
Get a stretcher.

607
01:31:42,833 --> 01:31:44,707
Hurry!

608
01:31:50,917 --> 01:31:55,499
What a fatal night.
I didn't foresee it.

609
01:31:55,917 --> 01:31:59,291
He had a noble heart after all.

610
01:31:59,542 --> 01:32:01,624
I have wronged him.

611
01:32:02,583 --> 01:32:04,874
Rudolf, you must comfort Bianca,

612
01:32:05,125 --> 01:32:08,957
love her with double love
to replace her father.

613
01:32:15,208 --> 01:32:17,291
You want to take him with you?

614
01:32:18,167 --> 01:32:20,041
Let's form a procession.

615
01:32:20,792 --> 01:32:26,332
Form a procession!

616
01:33:02,917 --> 01:33:04,707
One more thing, Rudolf.

617
01:33:04,958 --> 01:33:08,541
I should be the one
to provide for the old age

618
01:33:08,792 --> 01:33:10,957
of those homeless heroes.

619
01:33:11,542 --> 01:33:13,749
Unfortunately I'm a pauper.

620
01:33:18,708 --> 01:33:21,166
- How much?
- Ten thousand.

621
01:33:25,542 --> 01:33:27,499
- Five.
- No.

622
01:33:27,958 --> 01:33:29,749
Twelve.

623
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:58,124
Gentlemen! After what happened
no wax museum will take you in.

624
01:33:58,375 --> 01:34:00,707
Competition is big.

625
01:34:00,958 --> 01:34:03,541
As you have no practical skills,

626
01:34:03,792 --> 01:34:08,457
my friend made a donation
to purchase twelve barrel organs.

627
01:34:08,708 --> 01:34:13,707
Go around the world
and play to make people happy.

628
01:34:13,958 --> 01:34:16,666
You can choose the music.

629
01:34:17,833 --> 01:34:23,166
Now, dear friends
and noble gentlemen,

630
01:34:23,708 --> 01:34:29,624
let's cheer together:
Long live the newlyweds!

631
01:34:40,167 --> 01:34:41,874
Farewell, gentlemen.

632
01:34:42,750 --> 01:34:47,707
May what you see
be a warning to you.

633
01:34:47,958 --> 01:34:53,624
Don't ever try to guess
God's intentions.

634
01:34:54,917 --> 01:34:58,374
Ignorabimus, gentlemen.

635
01:34:58,625 --> 01:35:00,291
Ignorabimus.

636
01:35:05,708 --> 01:35:08,874
Are you Józef, Jakub's son?

637
01:35:09,958 --> 01:35:11,124
Maybe. Yes.

638
01:35:11,375 --> 01:35:15,957
Did you dream the standard
dream of biblical Joseph?

639
01:35:17,042 --> 01:35:18,624
Maybe.

640
01:35:21,042 --> 01:35:22,624
Well?

641
01:35:23,792 --> 01:35:28,124
Do you know that your dream
was noticed at the highest level

642
01:35:28,375 --> 01:35:30,416
and was severely criticized?

643
01:35:30,667 --> 01:35:32,832
I'm not responsible for my dreams.

644
01:35:33,083 --> 01:35:34,791
Yes, you are.

645
01:35:35,042 --> 01:35:40,124
You are under arrest in the name
of His Imperial and Royal Majesty.

646
01:35:41,083 --> 01:35:42,832
I'm at your disposal.

647
01:35:46,125 --> 01:35:50,749
His Imperial and Royal Majesty's
bureaucracy is a bit slow.

648
01:35:51,208 --> 01:35:55,749
I have surpassed that early dream
with more serious deeds.

649
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,832
I wanted to do justice
and kill myself.

650
01:35:59,083 --> 01:36:03,041
Now that obsolete dream
has saved my life!

651
01:36:22,208 --> 01:36:25,291
- Don't cry.
- I have a migraine.

652
01:36:28,625 --> 01:36:31,332
Come. We'll make tea.

653
01:36:39,792 --> 01:36:41,791
Is Adela at home?

654
01:36:42,042 --> 01:36:44,791
Adela left to America.

655
01:36:46,208 --> 01:36:47,957
She left?

656
01:36:49,792 --> 01:36:54,416
She went by ship and it sank.
All passengers died.

657
01:36:54,667 --> 01:36:56,999
We never heard from her again.

658
01:36:57,958 --> 01:37:01,874
What about father?
Where is he?

659
01:37:04,250 --> 01:37:10,916
He left many times,
but it was never final.

660
01:37:11,833 --> 01:37:14,666
It had its good points.

661
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:20,582
This way he prepared us
for his ultimate departure.

662
01:37:42,792 --> 01:37:44,791
Take me to him.

663
01:37:46,708 --> 01:37:48,207
All right.

664
01:37:51,167 --> 01:37:55,707
I think it's time for you
to see him.

665
01:38:03,792 --> 01:38:05,666
The shop is closed for good.

666
01:38:06,083 --> 01:38:10,374
Sometimes I go down there
to sell the remnants.

667
01:38:12,208 --> 01:38:15,332
But the shutters
are only half-open.

668
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,166
He was one of those

669
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:12,749
whose face was touched by
the hand of God while sleeping.

670
01:39:14,333 --> 01:39:18,207
They know
what they don't know.

671
01:39:19,458 --> 01:39:24,874
They become speculative
and suspicious.

672
01:39:27,833 --> 01:39:32,166
Through closed eyelids

673
01:39:32,417 --> 01:39:39,207
they see images of distant worlds.

674
01:40:02,417 --> 01:40:06,666
For man goes to his eternal home,

675
01:40:07,958 --> 01:40:11,541
while mourners go about
in the street.

676
01:40:12,750 --> 01:40:16,124
Before the silver cord is broken,

677
01:40:16,958 --> 01:40:19,707
and the golden bowl is crushed.

678
01:40:21,500 --> 01:40:24,874
The pitcher by the well is broken,

679
01:40:26,042 --> 01:40:29,249
and the wheel at
the cistern is crushed.

680
01:40:29,500 --> 01:40:34,374
Then the dust will return
to the earth as it was.

681
01:40:35,167 --> 01:40:39,832
And the spirit will return
to God who gave it.

682
01:41:08,250 --> 01:41:15,457
I'm so glad to see you, Józef.
What a surprise.

683
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:18,666
I feel so lonely here.

684
01:41:19,583 --> 01:41:25,207
Although I can't complain.
I've been through worse things.

685
01:41:28,875 --> 01:41:31,166
I must tell you something.

686
01:41:36,250 --> 01:41:38,707
But don't laugh.

687
01:41:38,958 --> 01:41:42,332
I rented a place for a shop here.

688
01:41:43,417 --> 01:41:48,291
It's nothing much.

689
01:41:49,042 --> 01:41:52,624
Back home I'd be ashamed
to have a stall like that.

690
01:41:52,875 --> 01:41:58,624
But here we had to pull
in our horns.

691
01:41:59,042 --> 01:42:01,457
Isn't that right, Józef?

692
01:42:02,375 --> 01:42:05,207
Life goes on.

693
01:42:09,875 --> 01:42:12,916
I must have overwound it.

694
01:42:16,458 --> 01:42:18,749
I see you're sleepy.

695
01:42:19,417 --> 01:42:21,582
Go back to sleep.

696
01:42:23,250 --> 01:42:30,791
You have no idea
how hard it was to get a loan.

697
01:42:31,250 --> 01:42:34,291
People here
don't trust old merchants.

698
01:42:34,542 --> 01:42:37,749
Merchants with past experience.

699
01:42:40,250 --> 01:42:44,374
Do you remember the optician's
shop in the market square?

700
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:48,416
Our shop is right next door.

701
01:42:50,083 --> 01:42:53,707
We don't have a sign yet.
But you'll find it.

702
01:43:00,625 --> 01:43:02,999
You're going out without your coat?

703
01:43:03,250 --> 01:43:07,416
I couldn't find it in my trunk.
They forgot to pack it.

704
01:43:09,458 --> 01:43:11,249
Take my coat.

705
01:43:12,542 --> 01:43:14,916
No. See you.

706
01:47:22,250 --> 01:47:24,582
Jakub! Go on, trade.

707
01:47:49,625 --> 01:47:52,332
Why don't you sit down, father?

708
01:47:53,542 --> 01:47:57,416
You're ill. You should
take care of yourself.

709
01:47:58,708 --> 01:48:02,582
Stop bothering me.
I'm busy.

710
01:48:25,708 --> 01:48:31,957
A letter came for you.
It's on my desk among papers.

711
01:50:44,500 --> 01:50:47,874
On my first day here
I was served

712
01:50:48,125 --> 01:50:52,832
an excellent fillet of beef
with mushrooms.

713
01:50:54,333 --> 01:50:57,124
It was a hell of a piece of meat.

714
01:50:57,375 --> 01:50:59,249
I have to warn you.

715
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:03,207
If they ever want to
serve you fillet of beef...

716
01:51:07,958 --> 01:51:10,832
Fillet of beef...

717
01:51:12,792 --> 01:51:16,582
I still feel fire in my stomach.

718
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,999
I have diarrhea after diarrhea.

719
01:51:21,250 --> 01:51:23,707
It's really tough.

720
01:51:23,958 --> 01:51:28,374
Or take, for instance,
hunter-style roast,

721
01:51:28,625 --> 01:51:33,707
stuffed with pate with gravy.

722
01:51:35,375 --> 01:51:39,457
Here we don't have to deny
ourselves anything.

723
01:51:39,708 --> 01:51:44,082
We can afford
to indulge big style.

724
01:51:47,083 --> 01:51:50,207
An angel of a boy.
So precious.

725
01:51:54,333 --> 01:51:57,457
You must admit he's charming.

726
01:52:02,750 --> 01:52:03,791
Got a light?

727
01:52:08,208 --> 01:52:13,166
Even schoolgirls here wear
bows in a special manner.

728
01:52:13,458 --> 01:52:20,332
If you as much as glance at them,
you get that sultry look...

729
01:52:22,625 --> 01:52:27,082
which fills us with desire.

730
01:53:15,750 --> 01:53:17,916
I have to see the doctor.

731
01:53:19,958 --> 01:53:22,541
He's at the restaurant.

732
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,166
I've just been there.

733
01:53:26,417 --> 01:53:29,791
Sorry.
I meant the operating room.

734
01:53:30,875 --> 01:53:34,707
We're evidently in a trap.

735
01:53:37,417 --> 01:53:41,457
Ever since I came here,
the sanatorium personnel

736
01:53:41,708 --> 01:53:45,457
hasn't done anything
to provide proper care.

737
01:53:45,708 --> 01:53:48,666
We're left to ourselves.

738
01:53:48,917 --> 01:53:53,207
I can't get a bed,
not to mention clean linen.

739
01:54:02,167 --> 01:54:07,457
Those secrets and discreet looks
of yours are just a mystification.

740
01:54:07,708 --> 01:54:11,957
I feel like opening all those
doors to expose the intrigue

741
01:54:12,208 --> 01:54:13,916
we got involved in.

742
01:54:16,833 --> 01:54:21,207
Get some sleep.
You can hardly keep on your feet.

743
01:55:29,042 --> 01:55:31,749
Józef, Józef...

744
01:55:33,125 --> 01:55:36,707
I've been lying in bed here,
left without any care.

745
01:55:36,958 --> 01:55:39,666
The wires have been cut.

746
01:55:41,208 --> 01:55:43,624
Nobody comes to see me.

747
01:55:43,958 --> 01:55:50,207
Nobody can make me
a cup of tea.

748
01:56:02,500 --> 01:56:08,791
My own son has
abandoned his sick father

749
01:56:09,667 --> 01:56:12,749
to chase girls in town.

750
01:56:13,750 --> 01:56:21,624
Józef, you should go
to our shop more often.

751
01:56:23,750 --> 01:56:28,041
The shop assistants
are stealing from us.

752
01:56:29,125 --> 01:56:33,291
Our shop will go to waste

753
01:56:34,167 --> 01:56:38,041
if nobody takes care of it.

754
01:56:39,792 --> 01:56:43,707
Look, my heart is pounding.

755
01:56:45,458 --> 01:56:48,874
My strength is leaving me.

756
01:57:03,917 --> 01:57:13,041
Józef, was there
any mail from home?

757
01:57:55,083 --> 01:57:56,541
Doctor...

758
01:57:56,792 --> 01:57:59,832
You're not looking well.
Take your jacket off.

759
01:58:00,083 --> 01:58:01,707
I'll examine you.

760
01:58:02,708 --> 01:58:05,999
Your irritation is justified.

761
01:58:06,250 --> 01:58:09,124
Your body,
especially your nervous system

762
01:58:09,375 --> 01:58:11,957
has to adjust to new conditions.

763
01:58:20,042 --> 01:58:23,416
We were deceived by an ad.

764
01:58:23,667 --> 01:58:27,749
It wasn't a good idea
to send my father here.

765
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:29,749
Moving back time!

766
01:58:32,208 --> 01:58:36,832
It sounds good.
But what is it in fact?

767
01:58:37,083 --> 01:58:41,291
Do we get fully valuable
and credible time here?

768
01:58:42,250 --> 01:58:46,166
No. We get time
used up by people.

769
01:58:46,417 --> 01:58:48,666
It's frayed and full of holes.

770
01:58:48,917 --> 01:58:54,166
It's vomited, secondhand time!

771
01:58:54,458 --> 01:59:00,457
You may question the quality
of your father's existence,

772
01:59:00,875 --> 01:59:04,082
but you can see him
and talk to him.

773
01:59:05,917 --> 01:59:09,041
You should be
very grateful to the doctor.

774
01:59:09,292 --> 01:59:13,207
Enough! Space is for people.

775
01:59:13,458 --> 01:59:16,457
In space you can swing around,
turn somersaults,

776
01:59:16,708 --> 01:59:18,249
jump from one star to another.

777
01:59:18,500 --> 01:59:20,916
But don't tamper with time!

778
01:59:21,333 --> 01:59:26,082
The blame for this lies
in fast decomposition...

779
01:59:32,958 --> 01:59:34,707
Of time.

780
01:59:39,042 --> 01:59:42,249
We all know that

781
01:59:42,500 --> 01:59:49,582
this chaotic element can be
kept within certain bounds

782
01:59:53,042 --> 01:59:58,707
if regulated continually.

783
02:00:01,208 --> 02:00:04,999
If not, it begins to play
all kinds of tricks.

784
02:00:05,250 --> 02:00:06,874
Isn't that right?

785
02:00:07,917 --> 02:00:11,041
You should take better
care of yourself.

786
02:00:11,292 --> 02:00:13,957
Wear warmer clothes.

787
02:00:14,208 --> 02:00:21,207
To start with, get some exercise.
Later we'll see.

788
02:00:24,417 --> 02:00:26,041
Chin up!

789
02:00:35,750 --> 02:00:40,124
It's lucky that father
is no longer alive.

790
02:00:41,417 --> 02:00:43,916
It won't affect him anymore.

791
02:03:31,875 --> 02:03:36,041
