THE HOURGLASS SANATORIUM

4
00:01:38,501 --> 00:01:42,209
Written by
Based on a novel by

5
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:50,334
Featuring

6
00:02:50,126 --> 00:02:53,501
Music

7
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:36,167
Director of photography

8
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:42,042
Directed by

9
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,251
We've almost arrived.

10
00:04:56,917 --> 00:04:58,959
How will I get there?

11
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:05,417
You'll find the way.
You don't need help.

12
00:08:27,792 --> 00:08:31,709
I've come a long way.
I booked a room by telegram.

13
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:33,417
Who can I see?

14
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:39,626
Everybody is sleeping.
<i>I'll</i> tell the doctor when he wakes up.

15
00:08:39,876 --> 00:08:43,709
Sleeping?
It's daytime not night.

16
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:52,459
They sleep all the time.
You didn't know?

17
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,626
Night never comes here.

18
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:03,667
You can wait downstairs.

19
00:09:10,834 --> 00:09:12,876
In the restaurant.

20
00:10:56,292 --> 00:10:58,417
The doctor will see you now.

21
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:00,084
Where is he?

22
00:11:16,751 --> 00:11:19,709
We received your telegram yesterday.

23
00:11:20,792 --> 00:11:24,126
We sent our coach to the station.

24
00:11:24,501 --> 00:11:27,084
You must have arrived
on a different train.

25
00:11:27,334 --> 00:11:28,376
The station?

26
00:11:29,376 --> 00:11:33,167
We don't have
a good train connection here.

27
00:11:33,417 --> 00:11:35,376
How are you feeling?

28
00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:42,501
Is my father alive?

29
00:11:45,209 --> 00:11:46,626
Of course.

30
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:53,667
I mean to an extent
allowed by the situation.

31
00:11:53,917 --> 00:11:59,792
You know, just as I do,
that from the perspective

32
00:12:00,042 --> 00:12:05,417
of your home, your country,

33
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:12,542
you father is dead.

34
00:12:15,792 --> 00:12:17,709
This cannot be fully reversed.

35
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:22,667
His death casts a shadow
on his existence here.

36
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:27,792
But he doesn't know or suspect?

37
00:12:28,376 --> 00:12:29,959
Don't worry.

38
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:35,876
Our patients don't suspect anything.

39
00:12:36,917 --> 00:12:38,251
They can't.

40
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:52,084
You probably want to see your father.
<i>I'll</i> take you there.

41
00:12:57,584 --> 00:13:03,251
We reserved a bed for you
in his room, as you requested.

42
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:47,876
The trick is that we moved back time.

43
00:13:49,876 --> 00:13:57,209
Time is late here by an interval
which I can't precisely define.

44
00:13:57,459 --> 00:14:02,959
It all boils down to relativity.

45
00:14:06,001 --> 00:14:09,876
Here, your father's death
hasn't occurred yet.

46
00:14:10,126 --> 00:14:18,292
But he met with his death
in your country.

47
00:14:24,251 --> 00:14:26,417
So my father is dead.

48
00:14:28,751 --> 00:14:33,126
- Or is close to death.
- You don't understand.

49
00:14:33,376 --> 00:14:37,626
We reactivate past time
with all its possibilities.

50
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:40,167
Including recovery.

51
00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:46,251
We let our patients sleep
for a long time.

52
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:49,501
We spare their vital energy.

53
00:14:50,334 --> 00:14:53,334
They have nothing better
to do anyway.

54
00:14:56,084 --> 00:14:58,251
Why don't you lie down?

55
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:05,959
There's nothing more
you can do now.

56
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:14,792
Good bye.

57
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,501
Good bye.

58
00:19:40,251 --> 00:19:42,667
I came to talk to you.

59
00:19:46,792 --> 00:19:48,209
Go on.

60
00:19:48,459 --> 00:19:55,292
Why are you spreading lies
and gossip about father?

61
00:19:55,876 --> 00:19:59,042
- What lies?
- I know you're behind them.

62
00:19:59,626 --> 00:20:01,459
I didn't lie.

63
00:20:06,126 --> 00:20:13,167
You remember how he went
missing for many days.

64
00:20:13,417 --> 00:20:15,292
He avoided us.

65
00:20:15,626 --> 00:20:19,792
Who knows whether
he's still alive somewhere?

66
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:25,251
I have to know the truth.

67
00:20:25,626 --> 00:20:29,334
Stop tormenting me.
It's hard to communicate with him.

68
00:20:29,584 --> 00:20:34,501
How can I cope
with everything myself?

69
00:20:34,751 --> 00:20:39,292
How can I answer questions
which God keeps asking me?

70
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:44,542
It's too much for me.
His complaints terrify me.

71
00:20:44,917 --> 00:20:48,376
- Don't cry.
- I have a migraine.

72
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:52,584
You won't go to school today.

73
00:20:53,751 --> 00:20:59,709
To school?
Mom, I'm not a little boy anymore.

74
00:21:01,292 --> 00:21:04,709
Yes, you are.
You've got ink on your hands.

75
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:09,834
Your knees are bruised.
You're a naughty, unruly boy.

76
00:21:15,417 --> 00:21:17,792
You hang out
with God knows whom.

77
00:21:18,042 --> 00:21:22,709
Wake those good-for-nothings.
It's time to open the shop.

78
00:21:23,126 --> 00:21:25,501
- But I'm sure...
- Stop tormenting me.

79
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:30,876
I told you that your father
travels around as a salesman.

80
00:21:31,126 --> 00:21:35,126
Sometimes
he returns home at night

81
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:39,751
only to go off again before dawn.

82
00:21:40,834 --> 00:21:43,167
I'm sure <i>he'll</i> come back.

83
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:59,876
You're tossing and turning
like fish out of water.

84
00:23:00,126 --> 00:23:03,626
- You sleep a bit, doze off a bit...
- Yawn a bit.

85
00:23:03,876 --> 00:23:05,917
And you rest again.

86
00:23:07,251 --> 00:23:11,792
You should learn wisdom
from an ant, lazybones.

87
00:23:12,542 --> 00:23:15,751
An ant? Go to hell.

88
00:23:16,209 --> 00:23:23,167
That ant of yours knows
no teacher, boss or shegetz.

89
00:23:24,084 --> 00:23:25,751
And it's doing fine.

90
00:23:26,001 --> 00:23:27,834
What's he talking about?

91
00:23:29,292 --> 00:23:35,084
I walked the fields of a lazy man.

92
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:43,876
I walked the vineyards
of a stupid man.

93
00:23:44,126 --> 00:23:47,834
Where is that from?
Our Lord didn't say that.

94
00:23:48,084 --> 00:23:49,501
Don't listen to it!

95
00:23:49,751 --> 00:23:54,667
Nettles grew over everything.

96
00:23:54,917 --> 00:23:58,542
Thorns covered his land.

97
00:23:58,876 --> 00:24:03,251
And the stonewall
collapsed to pieces.

98
00:24:32,542 --> 00:24:35,917
Clap your hands

99
00:24:36,292 --> 00:24:42,709
and call out His name
while rejoicing.

100
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:51,167
Call out his name to the sounds
of songs and trumpets.

101
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:45,959
Praise Him with harps,
praise Him with lyres.

102
00:25:46,292 --> 00:25:49,584
Praise Him with the drums
and dancing.

103
00:25:49,834 --> 00:25:53,501
Praise Him with stringed
instruments and horns.

104
00:25:53,751 --> 00:25:56,417
Praise Him with the cymbals.

105
00:25:56,667 --> 00:25:59,834
Praise him
with loud clanging cymbals.

106
00:26:00,084 --> 00:26:02,834
Let everything that
has breath praise the Lord.

107
00:26:03,084 --> 00:26:04,626
Alleluia.

108
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:07,542
Clap your hands and sing.

109
00:26:08,501 --> 00:26:09,959
Sing.

110
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:13,042
Sing wisely.

111
00:26:34,167 --> 00:26:41,834
In a dream he saw a ladder
that reaches from earth to heaven.

112
00:26:42,084 --> 00:26:46,917
And God's angels
were going up and down on it.

113
00:27:36,001 --> 00:27:37,667
Is it possible?

114
00:27:37,917 --> 00:27:42,084
It's our little Józef!

115
00:27:42,792 --> 00:27:47,084
Did you get lost on
your way to school?

116
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:50,667
Well?

117
00:27:51,792 --> 00:27:54,709
Rascals! They're everywhere.

118
00:27:54,959 --> 00:27:58,792
When I want to go down
to get bread in the morning,

119
00:27:59,042 --> 00:28:02,084
I can't even...

120
00:28:05,501 --> 00:28:07,501
...open the door.

121
00:28:07,834 --> 00:28:12,334
They squeeze through cracks.

122
00:28:12,584 --> 00:28:14,876
And try to get into the kitchen.

123
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:17,126
They ogle me.

124
00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:24,376
They can hardly wag their tails.

125
00:28:33,209 --> 00:28:35,917
They're overjoyed
when they see a fire.

126
00:28:36,167 --> 00:28:39,042
They clap their hands
and dance like savages.

127
00:28:39,292 --> 00:28:42,167
They're hopeless
at putting out fire.

128
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:44,376
But they like to celebrate.

129
00:28:44,626 --> 00:28:47,792
- Who are you talking about?
- Those idle firemen.

130
00:28:48,042 --> 00:28:54,959
They get lazy in autumn.
They sleep while standing.

131
00:28:55,584 --> 00:29:00,084
I think you're prejudiced.
They're nice boys.

132
00:29:14,251 --> 00:29:21,834
An old stove-fitter told me
that when he repairs chimneys,

133
00:29:22,334 --> 00:29:26,334
he finds them attached
to the smoke vent,

134
00:29:26,709 --> 00:29:29,042
motionless like the larvae.

135
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:34,584
They sleep like that being
drunk from raspberry juice.

136
00:29:35,209 --> 00:29:39,126
And they whine in their sleep:
“Sugar, sugar”.

137
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:47,501
If I glance at one of them,

138
00:29:47,792 --> 00:29:54,417
his face swells and becomes
obscenely red like a turkey.

139
00:29:55,709 --> 00:29:59,501
I heard that it's a way
of strengthening the inner self.

140
00:29:59,751 --> 00:30:04,417
And rejuvenating colours
when firemen eject fireworks,

141
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:07,209
rockets and Bengali lights.

142
00:30:07,709 --> 00:30:09,667
I won't give them
any juice anyway.

143
00:30:09,959 --> 00:30:15,251
I didn't ruin my complexion
hovering over the stove to make it,

144
00:30:15,501 --> 00:30:17,417
so those rascals could drink it.

145
00:30:18,459 --> 00:30:20,292
Unfortunately, Adela,

146
00:30:20,542 --> 00:30:24,751
you never understood things
which go beyond the mundane.

147
00:30:25,001 --> 00:30:26,292
Look.

148
00:30:33,626 --> 00:30:37,667
Is it possible to grow hair
to the ground?

149
00:30:43,084 --> 00:30:47,459
You look so different.
Just wonderful!

150
00:30:47,876 --> 00:30:49,917
The captain of rascals!

151
00:30:52,959 --> 00:30:57,542
“I, Anna Csillag, born in Moravia,
had poor hair growth”.

152
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:00,292
I wish I had hair like that.

153
00:31:03,042 --> 00:31:05,542
Would you like some water?

154
00:31:07,292 --> 00:31:10,417
- With raspberry juice.
- No, thanks.

155
00:31:10,917 --> 00:31:12,376
Too bad.

156
00:31:13,084 --> 00:31:19,167
Her poor hair growth
was divine retribution.

157
00:31:19,417 --> 00:31:23,751
But prayers and penance
took the curse off her.

158
00:31:24,001 --> 00:31:26,834
She was graced with enlightenment.

159
00:31:27,084 --> 00:31:34,001
She received signs
and made this miraculous remedy.

160
00:31:35,167 --> 00:31:36,751
Look.

161
00:31:38,334 --> 00:31:44,167
These are her brothers,
cousins and brothers-in-law.

162
00:31:45,251 --> 00:31:46,709
Who's he?

163
00:31:46,959 --> 00:31:52,584
Another brother-in-law.
She made a whole town happy.

164
00:31:54,001 --> 00:31:55,417
Really?

165
00:32:01,626 --> 00:32:04,001
“Elsa. The fluid with a swan”.

166
00:32:04,917 --> 00:32:10,334
It's a balm for all afflictions.
It works wonders.

167
00:32:10,584 --> 00:32:12,626
Where did you get this book?

168
00:32:12,876 --> 00:32:17,501
It's been here all the time,
scattered around.

169
00:32:20,834 --> 00:32:24,334
“Smoke all you want”.
“Sexual Neurasthenia”.

170
00:32:24,584 --> 00:32:26,209
“Gramophones”.

171
00:32:29,251 --> 00:32:30,626
You silly thing.

172
00:32:30,876 --> 00:32:34,667
We use its pages to wrap meat
and your father's lunch.

173
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:45,459
It's degradation of an original book.

174
00:33:03,626 --> 00:33:07,376
You're late.
There's no more juice.

175
00:33:07,626 --> 00:33:11,334
I have some rose preserve.
It's not bad.

176
00:33:13,001 --> 00:33:14,501
Adela!

177
00:33:14,751 --> 00:33:17,292
- Try it.
- Thank you.

178
00:33:18,917 --> 00:33:22,959
- It's not a preserve.
- So what? It tastes sweet.

179
00:33:29,292 --> 00:33:30,709
Is your name Jakub?

180
00:33:32,209 --> 00:33:35,792
No, I'm Józef.
Jakub is my father.

181
00:33:36,251 --> 00:33:39,042
I see.

182
00:33:42,584 --> 00:33:46,626
Can you come out?
We can't talk like this.

183
00:33:48,417 --> 00:33:51,334
- Excuse me.
- It's all right.

184
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:09,542
I have a valuable delivery.
Where can I find your father?

185
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,959
I'm looking for him myself.

186
00:34:12,209 --> 00:34:16,792
Allow me to introduce
Honduras and Nicaragua.

187
00:34:17,042 --> 00:34:18,709
Come closer.

188
00:34:26,167 --> 00:34:27,459
It's spotted.

189
00:34:27,709 --> 00:34:31,584
That's right.
It's perishable.

190
00:34:33,084 --> 00:34:35,501
- Birds of paradise?
- Not only.

191
00:34:35,792 --> 00:34:39,751
For hatching, it's best to let
Belgian hens sit on them.

192
00:34:40,001 --> 00:34:42,126
Or you can do it yourself.

193
00:34:45,334 --> 00:34:48,084
I think I see your father.

194
00:34:50,542 --> 00:34:52,001
Over there!

195
00:34:54,001 --> 00:34:58,167
Don't you think he's behaving
in a strange way?

196
00:34:59,917 --> 00:35:01,667
He's demonstrating.

197
00:35:40,709 --> 00:35:42,126
Father!

198
00:35:44,251 --> 00:35:45,334
Father...

199
00:35:45,584 --> 00:35:50,542
You should beware of things
like narrow-mindedness,

200
00:35:50,792 --> 00:35:54,459
pedantry and blind literalism.

201
00:35:54,709 --> 00:35:59,501
Have you noticed that
in some books flocks of swallows

202
00:35:59,751 --> 00:36:04,501
are flying between the verses?
Stanzas of swallows.

203
00:36:04,751 --> 00:36:08,501
You should learn to read
from the flight of these birds.

204
00:36:08,751 --> 00:36:12,334
Father. I have to tell you something.

205
00:36:12,584 --> 00:36:14,584
It's a secret.
I found an original.

206
00:36:14,834 --> 00:36:16,584
- An original?
- Yes.

207
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,501
Look.

208
00:36:21,292 --> 00:36:24,584
It's worthless!

209
00:36:24,876 --> 00:36:26,167
It's a book!

210
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:28,709
It's just a myth.

211
00:36:28,959 --> 00:36:32,209
A book is a myth
we believe in when we're young.

212
00:36:32,459 --> 00:36:36,917
We stop treating it seriously
as we get older.

213
00:36:37,292 --> 00:36:44,209
Books live a borrowed life.

214
00:36:44,501 --> 00:36:47,959
Every book has a moment

215
00:36:48,209 --> 00:36:52,251
when it soars into the air like

216
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:56,834
a phoenix with its pages on fire!

217
00:36:57,834 --> 00:36:59,209
Look.

218
00:37:07,584 --> 00:37:13,209
We love them for that moment.

219
00:37:13,459 --> 00:37:17,917
But they turn to ashes.

220
00:37:18,334 --> 00:37:19,542
Thank you.

221
00:37:20,209 --> 00:37:25,834
Why doesn't anybody
offer goldfinch?

222
00:37:28,251 --> 00:37:30,167
Where?

223
00:37:36,001 --> 00:37:39,376
A book is a myth, my son.

224
00:37:48,792 --> 00:37:51,917
It soars into the air
like a phoenix.

225
00:38:11,584 --> 00:38:13,209
Hyderabad.

226
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:15,876
Guatemala.

227
00:38:16,542 --> 00:38:19,542
Tasmania, San Domingo.

228
00:38:20,542 --> 00:38:22,167
Sierra Leone.

229
00:38:24,542 --> 00:38:29,334
Labrador, Barbados,
Trinidad, El Salvador,

230
00:38:29,584 --> 00:38:32,292
Borneo, Sumatra, Pernambuco.

231
00:38:34,042 --> 00:38:35,667
Hiporabundia.

232
00:38:35,917 --> 00:38:37,959
You're talking nonsense.

233
00:38:38,209 --> 00:38:40,792
You could say Panfibras.

234
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:47,126
Haleiwa, Abracadabra.

235
00:38:51,584 --> 00:38:55,917
Why do I get the feeling
that I've been there before?

236
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,751
A long time ago.

237
00:38:59,126 --> 00:39:05,167
What if we know all landscapes
that we come across in life?

238
00:39:07,001 --> 00:39:10,959
Can anything new happen?

239
00:39:12,001 --> 00:39:14,126
Something we can't sense?

240
00:39:51,084 --> 00:39:52,834
Do you hear me?

241
00:39:55,167 --> 00:39:58,709
I want to know if all this
could have happened.

242
00:40:00,084 --> 00:40:01,626
Answer me.

243
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:05,126
Did it happen or not?

244
00:40:08,209 --> 00:40:09,751
Yes and no.

245
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:15,042
There are some things
that can't fully happen.

246
00:40:15,292 --> 00:40:21,626
They are too grand and magnificent
to fit into an event.

247
00:40:21,876 --> 00:40:25,959
They just try to happen.

248
00:40:26,209 --> 00:40:29,792
Tell me if they really exist.

249
00:41:04,334 --> 00:41:05,917
She did exist.

250
00:41:07,751 --> 00:41:10,459
And nothing can
take away my certainty.

251
00:42:07,709 --> 00:42:11,417
Don't be afraid.
She can't hear us.

252
00:42:12,626 --> 00:42:15,709
It's my dead mother,
she lives here.

253
00:42:16,501 --> 00:42:22,084
She's inhabited by ghosts,
phantoms, larvae and chrysalises.

254
00:42:26,959 --> 00:42:28,709
Helpless and naive,

255
00:42:28,959 --> 00:42:32,751
she takes them into her dream
and sleeps with them.

256
00:42:33,001 --> 00:42:37,209
She wakes up half-conscious
at dawn and remembers nothing.

257
00:42:37,459 --> 00:42:39,501
That's why she's so sad.

258
00:42:40,042 --> 00:42:43,751
She has to live so many lives.

259
00:42:46,167 --> 00:42:49,667
Do you know a story
that time cannot change?

260
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:55,501
There is one that
you haven't heard.

261
00:42:56,126 --> 00:42:59,334
It belongs to the night.

262
00:42:59,584 --> 00:43:03,126
Will you find the patience
to listen to it?

263
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:08,667
Somebody will walk
across the sky,

264
00:43:08,917 --> 00:43:11,501
cuddling a baby in a coat.

265
00:43:12,542 --> 00:43:16,251
Constantly on the way,
on a endless journey.

266
00:43:17,126 --> 00:43:20,042
He'll pass us with long steps.

267
00:43:20,834 --> 00:43:23,126
That's what's going to happen.

268
00:43:23,376 --> 00:43:27,876
Over and over again.

269
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:36,751
Bianca, you can count on me!
Till the last drop of blood!

270
00:43:44,209 --> 00:43:45,584
Well?

271
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:49,126
It's a riddle.

272
00:43:49,876 --> 00:43:51,334
What about her?

273
00:43:51,584 --> 00:43:56,042
She's all grey.

274
00:43:57,001 --> 00:44:01,251
The touch of her hand must
be beyond imagination.

275
00:44:01,501 --> 00:44:03,667
What did you see there?

276
00:44:05,292 --> 00:44:09,126
Something colourful,
colonial terrifying.

277
00:44:10,126 --> 00:44:13,876
Abductions, pursuits, betrayals.

278
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:18,917
It's a story about an abducted
and switched princess.

279
00:44:19,167 --> 00:44:21,126
You're making it up.

280
00:44:24,834 --> 00:44:26,209
Java.

281
00:44:27,126 --> 00:44:28,459
Sumatra.

282
00:44:28,917 --> 00:44:30,251
Borneo.

283
00:44:31,042 --> 00:44:35,917
I can appoint you as coregent.
Anonymously.

284
00:44:36,501 --> 00:44:39,876
Together with the stamp album
we'll form a triumvirate.

285
00:44:40,126 --> 00:44:44,542
We'll be responsible
for this unsolved affair.

286
00:44:45,126 --> 00:44:47,542
With the stamp album?

287
00:44:47,792 --> 00:44:51,667
What a naive question.
It's a universal book.

288
00:44:51,917 --> 00:44:55,001
A compendium of knowledge
about human life containing

289
00:44:55,251 --> 00:44:57,292
allusions and understatements.

290
00:44:57,542 --> 00:45:04,209
This story will be interspersed
with dashes, ellipses and sighs.

291
00:45:05,459 --> 00:45:08,709
It requires a bit of intelligence
and imagination.

292
00:45:08,959 --> 00:45:12,709
Your words are delirious,
ridiculous, insane.

293
00:45:12,959 --> 00:45:17,709
I was fond of you, Rudolf,
because you own this album.

294
00:45:17,959 --> 00:45:21,459
Now your outbursts of
envy put me off.

295
00:45:23,042 --> 00:45:26,209
Don't forget that you're
dependent on me.

296
00:45:29,334 --> 00:45:31,959
I have to get to the other side.

297
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:50,626
I know.
Her father is a ship's doctor.

298
00:45:51,251 --> 00:45:54,084
A small steam boat
with wheels at the sides

299
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:57,459
is waiting for her
every night at the pier.

300
00:45:57,709 --> 00:45:59,334
It's lights are off.

301
00:45:59,584 --> 00:46:02,251
Don't go there.
I have a bad feeling.

302
00:46:03,001 --> 00:46:08,001
Don't worry. I may seem excited,
but I have my fears.

303
00:46:08,334 --> 00:46:11,334
Won't it be safer to look through
the stamp album?

304
00:46:11,584 --> 00:46:14,084
You haven't seen New Mexico.

305
00:46:14,334 --> 00:46:18,209
Remember that there
is no final Mexico.

306
00:46:18,459 --> 00:46:20,834
Behind every Mexico
there is a new one.

307
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:08,042
They only seem dead.

308
00:49:09,084 --> 00:49:13,042
The don't have to breathe
for a longer period.

309
00:49:13,292 --> 00:49:16,792
These villains won't be
characters in novels.

310
00:49:17,584 --> 00:49:21,209
They're just a makeshift creation,
a one-time thing.

311
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:26,209
They were caught at a moment
when their obsession,

312
00:49:26,459 --> 00:49:28,542
their madness was real.

313
00:49:28,792 --> 00:49:34,584
Skilfully prepared, it became
the core of their new existence.

314
00:49:36,417 --> 00:49:43,167
A new man was created
in the image of a mannequin.

315
00:49:44,584 --> 00:49:49,334
This is anarchist Luccheni,
assassin of Empress Elisabeth.

316
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:07,626
And this is Draga,
the demonic Queen of Serbia.

317
00:50:08,667 --> 00:50:11,084
Edison and Bismarck.

318
00:50:11,792 --> 00:50:13,709
“Leatherstocking”.

319
00:50:15,459 --> 00:50:20,459
This is a young genius,
the pride and hope of his family.

320
00:50:20,709 --> 00:50:23,709
Addiction to masturbation
ruined his life.

321
00:50:23,959 --> 00:50:27,209
Unfortunately, they're not authentic.

322
00:50:29,501 --> 00:50:34,376
But we put a lot of effort
into making them look good.

323
00:50:34,626 --> 00:50:37,709
Their faces are pale,

324
00:50:37,959 --> 00:50:41,667
flushed from
the illness they died of.

325
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:51,376
Now take a look at
Emperor Franz Joseph.

326
00:50:52,417 --> 00:50:57,751
Wrinkles on his face make him
look like he's smiling.

327
00:50:58,042 --> 00:51:01,459
But when you come closer,
you see that

328
00:51:01,709 --> 00:51:04,834
his smile is just a grimace
of bitterness and terseness.

329
00:51:05,126 --> 00:51:07,751
He had a younger brother,

330
00:51:08,001 --> 00:51:11,084
so different spiritually
and ideologically.

331
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:16,126
This unfortunate antagonist,
disadvantaged by birth,

332
00:51:16,542 --> 00:51:20,584
was Archduke Maximilian.

333
00:51:22,042 --> 00:51:27,584
The emperor loved him secretly,
but planned to get rid of him.

334
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:32,834
He appointed him commander
of the Levantine Ship Squadron,

335
00:51:33,084 --> 00:51:34,959
hoping that he'd go under.

336
00:51:35,209 --> 00:51:40,501
Later he signed a secret alliance
with Napoleon Ill.

337
00:51:41,167 --> 00:51:42,459
That's him.

338
00:51:45,751 --> 00:51:51,417
He used deception to involve
Maximilian in the Mexican incident.

339
00:51:51,667 --> 00:51:58,501
This creative young man
renounced his Habsburg title

340
00:51:58,751 --> 00:52:02,751
only to ride aboard
the French liner “Le Cid”

341
00:52:03,001 --> 00:52:07,501
right into a trap.

342
00:52:07,959 --> 00:52:11,917
Some sources say
he was just a cousin.

343
00:52:12,751 --> 00:52:16,042
Others that he was never born.

344
00:52:16,292 --> 00:52:20,042
He was conjectured from the fears
and hallucinations the emperor

345
00:52:20,292 --> 00:52:23,126
experienced while sleeping.

346
00:52:23,667 --> 00:52:28,126
We had problems putting
him back together

347
00:52:28,501 --> 00:52:32,292
after his execution in Vera Cruz.

348
00:52:32,542 --> 00:52:36,542
Unfortunately,
he still suffers from amnesia.

349
00:52:36,792 --> 00:52:40,959
I had to teach him everything
about his life again.

350
00:52:41,209 --> 00:52:45,167
My only success is that
at the sound of the name

351
00:52:45,834 --> 00:52:52,084
of Emperor Franz Joseph
he draws his sword.

352
00:52:59,126 --> 00:53:02,917
He wounded Victor Emmanuel.

353
00:53:03,959 --> 00:53:08,501
The latter didn't manage to get out
of his way quickly enough.

354
00:53:17,834 --> 00:53:19,251
Bianca...

355
00:53:20,001 --> 00:53:22,084
and Maximilian?

356
00:53:40,876 --> 00:53:43,126
It's a simple mechanical trick.

357
00:53:43,376 --> 00:53:46,709
When wound up he moves
and acts like a live person.

358
00:54:31,126 --> 00:54:34,709
A simple mechanical trick
my foot!

359
00:54:34,959 --> 00:54:36,876
A cynic in the tropics.

360
00:54:37,126 --> 00:54:39,417
No, a tropical cynic.

361
00:54:40,501 --> 00:54:44,376
And Rudolf said I exaggerated
and made things up.

362
00:54:47,376 --> 00:54:51,876
They should take their medicine
and be in bed by now.

363
00:54:52,126 --> 00:54:56,209
It's not good to keep them
on stands for so long.

364
00:54:59,084 --> 00:55:00,959
I can smell curare.

365
00:55:02,792 --> 00:55:08,376
Would you like to see
my collection of weapons?

366
00:55:08,792 --> 00:55:12,251
So my intuition was right after all.

367
00:55:12,501 --> 00:55:15,167
Under the cover of law
and order hair-rising things

368
00:55:15,417 --> 00:55:17,334
are happening here.

369
00:55:18,751 --> 00:55:21,917
Will you tell me who Bianca is?

370
00:55:27,376 --> 00:55:29,542
Her mother was a Creole.

371
00:55:29,792 --> 00:55:32,959
Archduke Maximilian called her
lovingly Conchita.

372
00:55:33,209 --> 00:55:38,459
She went down in history under
that name, through the back door.

373
00:55:38,709 --> 00:55:40,834
Her mother?
You mean grandmother?

374
00:55:41,667 --> 00:55:43,001
Mother.

375
00:55:43,792 --> 00:55:49,001
After Maximilian's downfall,
she took her daughter to Paris.

376
00:55:49,251 --> 00:55:51,709
She lived on a widow's pension.

377
00:55:51,959 --> 00:55:56,917
That's where history loses track
of our touching character.

378
00:55:57,167 --> 00:56:00,126
Allow me to finish for you.

379
00:56:00,376 --> 00:56:03,001
It's confidential!

380
00:56:03,251 --> 00:56:06,959
Keep calm and control yourself.

381
00:56:16,751 --> 00:56:18,751
100,000 pesos.

382
00:56:21,084 --> 00:56:26,751
My business is not going well.
It's an expensive project.

383
00:56:28,126 --> 00:56:33,417
In 1900 a Mrs. de V,
a woman of exotic beauty,

384
00:56:33,667 --> 00:56:38,376
leaves France and goes to Austria
with her daughter and husband,

385
00:56:38,626 --> 00:56:39,959
having fake passports.

386
00:56:40,209 --> 00:56:45,876
They get arrested in Salzburg,
while changing trains to Vienna.

387
00:56:46,167 --> 00:56:52,126
After checking his fake passport,
Mr. de V is free to go.

388
00:56:52,376 --> 00:56:55,959
But he does nothing to get
his wife and daughter released.

389
00:56:56,209 --> 00:57:02,042
That very day he goes back
to France and is never seen again.

390
00:57:02,292 --> 00:57:07,001
I will be the one to identify him.

391
00:57:13,917 --> 00:57:16,542
150,000 pesos.

392
00:57:17,917 --> 00:57:22,042
You're so uncompromising.
What do you want?

393
00:57:22,292 --> 00:57:27,292
Your decisions will show
if you're aware of the situation.

394
00:57:27,542 --> 00:57:30,917
- I want facts!
- Stop!

395
00:57:37,584 --> 00:57:42,209
I think Bianca's origin
has been confirmed.

396
01:00:06,667 --> 01:00:10,251
Negroes!
Hordes of Negroes!

397
01:00:10,501 --> 01:00:12,584
Negroes at this time of the year?

398
01:00:12,834 --> 01:00:16,376
The barometer
must be at its lowest point.

399
01:00:16,876 --> 01:00:18,417
Bianca?

400
01:00:20,626 --> 01:00:23,251
I thought you'd never get here.

401
01:00:23,584 --> 01:00:27,001
- Sit down.
- No, infanta.

402
01:00:27,667 --> 01:00:30,751
I have to do duties
which fate has assigned to me.

403
01:00:31,001 --> 01:00:33,126
I have to carry out my plan.

404
01:00:33,376 --> 01:00:35,876
Did you bring anything to read?

405
01:00:39,751 --> 01:00:42,126
Decrees. Sign them.

406
01:00:49,417 --> 01:00:54,376
“Daisy, Daisy give me your answer”.
Barrel organs everywhere!

407
01:00:59,417 --> 01:01:03,167
Real marvels of technology.
They may come in handy.

408
01:01:06,459 --> 01:01:09,126
Things went so far that

409
01:01:09,376 --> 01:01:14,334
I got involved in the dynastic
affairs of great monarchs.

410
01:01:14,584 --> 01:01:16,292
I think we're in trouble.

411
01:01:16,542 --> 01:01:18,417
Let's think about betrayal.

412
01:01:18,667 --> 01:01:20,334
- Betrayal?
- Yes.

413
01:01:20,584 --> 01:01:22,959
- Betrayal?
- That's right.

414
01:01:23,209 --> 01:01:25,501
Do you have a better idea?

415
01:01:25,751 --> 01:01:27,542
I don't understand.

416
01:01:31,001 --> 01:01:34,834
It must be a wonderful feeling.

417
01:01:35,542 --> 01:01:38,792
To penetrate the depths
of villainy and erase oneself

418
01:01:39,042 --> 01:01:40,792
from one's own memory.

419
01:01:42,542 --> 01:01:50,459
Wouldn't you like to be defiled
or repulsive for a moment?

420
01:01:51,209 --> 01:01:53,292
But totally renewed.

421
01:01:54,667 --> 01:01:59,167
Do it.
You'll become one of them.

422
01:02:00,001 --> 01:02:02,209
One of those black Negroes.

423
01:02:02,459 --> 01:02:08,001
Now that things are at the final
stage you want me to betray?

424
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:14,501
You're ridiculous with your
faithfulness and sense of mission!

425
01:02:15,251 --> 01:02:17,584
- What if I chose Rudolf?
- No.

426
01:02:17,834 --> 01:02:22,292
I prefer him a thousand times
over you, a boring pedant.

427
01:02:23,209 --> 01:02:25,084
He would be obedient.

428
01:02:25,584 --> 01:02:29,917
Even when it came to crime
or self-destruction.

429
01:02:30,167 --> 01:02:31,834
Rudolf obedient?

430
01:02:32,501 --> 01:02:35,417
Do you remember Lonka,
the washerwoman's daughter?

431
01:02:35,667 --> 01:02:37,584
You played with her
when you were a little boy.

432
01:02:37,834 --> 01:02:40,042
- Yes.
- It was me.

433
01:02:40,376 --> 01:02:42,459
Only I was a boy at that time.

434
01:02:42,709 --> 01:02:44,292
Did you like me then?

435
01:02:44,542 --> 01:02:49,084
Bianca, I feel everything
is going the wrong way.

436
01:02:49,334 --> 01:02:50,876
Must you disappoint me?

437
01:02:51,126 --> 01:02:53,584
May I see your tickets, please?

438
01:03:00,751 --> 01:03:02,334
Conductor...

439
01:03:02,584 --> 01:03:06,626
What is going on here?

440
01:03:06,876 --> 01:03:10,126
Take it easy. Don't panic.

441
01:03:10,376 --> 01:03:14,542
We'll fix everything quietly.
We don't need help.

442
01:03:14,792 --> 01:03:18,376
Normal facts are arranged in time.

443
01:03:18,626 --> 01:03:21,167
They are threaded on it...

444
01:03:22,584 --> 01:03:25,042
...like onto a string.

445
01:03:25,292 --> 01:03:28,834
It's important for
narration and continuity.

446
01:03:29,084 --> 01:03:31,584
Fine.

447
01:03:32,584 --> 01:03:38,251
What about events
which have no place in time?

448
01:03:39,167 --> 01:03:44,001
Events which
have occurred too late,

449
01:03:44,251 --> 01:03:46,334
when time has been allocated?

450
01:03:46,584 --> 01:03:50,626
Is time too tight
to take in all events?

451
01:03:50,876 --> 01:03:55,376
Time has its side offshoots,
somewhat illegal and dubious.

452
01:03:55,626 --> 01:03:57,667
But we can't be too fussy

453
01:03:57,917 --> 01:04:02,542
when dealing with events
that cannot be classified.

454
01:04:03,084 --> 01:04:09,584
Who knows? Maybe all the dirty
manipulation is behind us.

455
01:04:09,834 --> 01:04:14,584
We're heading to a dead end.

456
01:04:16,751 --> 01:04:18,251
Exactly.

457
01:04:20,209 --> 01:04:22,626
How can I get out of here?

458
01:04:24,542 --> 01:04:28,917
Why don't you try going
under the bed again?

459
01:04:32,209 --> 01:04:36,167
- Excuse me, I have to go.
- Coward!

460
01:04:36,417 --> 01:04:38,917
I hope to come back again.

461
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:41,376
Coward!

462
01:04:44,917 --> 01:04:47,459
Stupid coward.

463
01:05:32,292 --> 01:05:33,751
It's you.

464
01:05:42,084 --> 01:05:44,376
You don't look well.

465
01:05:44,626 --> 01:05:48,667
Everything is mixed up, father.

466
01:05:49,459 --> 01:05:51,001
Father?

467
01:05:51,251 --> 01:05:57,292
It takes a lot of patience to find
the right words in this confusion.

468
01:05:57,542 --> 01:06:04,501
You can do it by grammatical
analysis of sentences and tenses.

469
01:06:05,334 --> 01:06:09,334
What? I don't remember.

470
01:06:10,626 --> 01:06:12,917
I am, he is, she is...

471
01:06:13,167 --> 01:06:14,459
I've got it!

472
01:06:15,126 --> 01:06:16,792
You are, we are!

473
01:06:18,251 --> 01:06:21,126
They are...

474
01:06:26,459 --> 01:06:31,584
You need to eliminate
flirtatious chatter of birds,

475
01:06:34,334 --> 01:06:41,417
their pointed adverbs, prepositions,

476
01:06:41,667 --> 01:06:48,084
and timid personal pronouns
to find a healthy grain of time.

477
01:07:15,417 --> 01:07:23,167
Legend books,
unwritten books, great epics,

478
01:07:23,959 --> 01:07:28,001
pallid and monotonous
nameless novels,

479
01:07:28,251 --> 01:07:33,209
faceless giants,
dark evening stories,

480
01:07:33,459 --> 01:07:39,251
cloudy dramas,
errant and lost books.

481
01:08:44,376 --> 01:08:46,501
You must have a lot of work.

482
01:08:46,751 --> 01:08:50,501
The light on in your room
late at night.

483
01:08:51,167 --> 01:08:53,584
Try. See if you can do it.

484
01:09:12,042 --> 01:09:14,126
Fascinating!

485
01:09:14,376 --> 01:09:18,542
What a beauty!

486
01:09:19,084 --> 01:09:25,584
Remember. Paradisea apoda
or the bird of paradise.

487
01:09:27,501 --> 01:09:29,626
Cardinalis cardinalis!

488
01:09:32,209 --> 01:09:34,376
Chrysolophus pictus.

489
01:09:36,292 --> 01:09:37,834
Upupa epops.

490
01:09:41,667 --> 01:09:46,084
I want you to take
something with you.

491
01:09:46,584 --> 01:09:49,209
Anything, at least a tiny bit.

492
01:09:50,251 --> 01:09:55,459
Get it into your blood,
your life and save it.

493
01:09:56,001 --> 01:09:57,834
And live With it.

494
01:10:05,126 --> 01:10:09,084
Come in!

495
01:10:10,876 --> 01:10:13,084
Go now.
They're looking for you.

496
01:10:13,334 --> 01:10:16,792
I don't want to be disturbed.
Go.

497
01:10:25,376 --> 01:10:26,751
Go!

498
01:10:37,417 --> 01:10:39,001
Go!

499
01:11:21,001 --> 01:11:22,709
Look at you.

500
01:11:24,917 --> 01:11:27,167
You're covered in cobwebs.

501
01:11:28,126 --> 01:11:30,334
You ripped your coat.

502
01:11:31,084 --> 01:11:33,376
You've been in the attic again.

503
01:11:43,292 --> 01:11:46,584
Shop assistants steal from us,
people buy on credit only,

504
01:11:46,834 --> 01:11:49,084
and you just play around.

505
01:11:49,626 --> 01:11:53,334
Take it to the shop.
Your father must be hungry.

506
01:12:08,167 --> 01:12:09,959
The shop!

507
01:13:16,376 --> 01:13:18,292
They're looking for you.

508
01:13:18,542 --> 01:13:19,917
It's hot.

509
01:13:21,459 --> 01:13:23,459
Who?

510
01:13:24,334 --> 01:13:27,001
The shop assistants,
especially Teodor.

511
01:13:27,251 --> 01:13:32,584
I know. They'll be climbing
the ladder up and down.

512
01:13:35,584 --> 01:13:37,501
Up and down.

513
01:13:59,667 --> 01:14:01,251
Józef!

514
01:14:04,209 --> 01:14:07,959
I wish you
had been born earlier.

515
01:14:21,209 --> 01:14:22,626
Come!

516
01:14:39,209 --> 01:14:42,626
Take it to them.
It'll scare them.

517
01:14:44,792 --> 01:14:48,126
Adela, Holofernes was a man.

518
01:14:48,626 --> 01:14:53,334
Whatever. I kept her in borsch
to make her look better.

519
01:15:10,417 --> 01:15:12,042
I'll buy it.

520
01:15:16,376 --> 01:15:18,417
Lay off. it's not for sale.

521
01:15:18,667 --> 01:15:23,001
What? The head is in a shop,
so it's for sale.

522
01:15:23,251 --> 01:15:24,751
I'll buy it.

523
01:16:01,126 --> 01:16:02,501
Father!

524
01:16:04,459 --> 01:16:08,084
Take it away.
There's no room here.

525
01:16:11,626 --> 01:16:14,584
Stop bothering me.
I'm busy.

526
01:16:30,876 --> 01:16:34,459
Jakub! Go on, trade!

527
01:17:03,501 --> 01:17:05,251
Father!

528
01:17:50,001 --> 01:17:52,626
Wake up, Józef.

529
01:17:52,876 --> 01:17:56,834
I know you're exhausted.
It's only a few steps more.

530
01:17:57,334 --> 01:18:01,459
Father, you're ill. You should
take care of yourself.

531
01:18:02,001 --> 01:18:05,251
Can you hear him?
He's coming.

532
01:18:06,417 --> 01:18:10,167
I know him since childhood.
We went to school together.

533
01:18:10,417 --> 01:18:18,501
That egoist disgusted me.
He devoured lots of buttered rolls.

534
01:18:19,292 --> 01:18:23,792
Go and meet him.
He'll think I ignore him.

535
01:18:25,917 --> 01:18:28,376
Go!

536
01:19:19,792 --> 01:19:23,834
If I'm not mistaken it's Józef,
Jakub's son.

537
01:19:24,084 --> 01:19:27,751
May the sky over your heads
always be blue,

538
01:19:28,001 --> 01:19:30,501
and the ground under
your feet moist with dew.

539
01:19:30,751 --> 01:19:32,917
I don't think I need to say that.

540
01:19:33,167 --> 01:19:36,917
You can hear their shop
is as busy as a beehive.

541
01:19:39,459 --> 01:19:43,251
It's just appearances
and pitiful mystification.

542
01:19:44,584 --> 01:19:46,876
Mother complains
that people buy on credit only.

543
01:19:47,709 --> 01:19:49,959
- What did he say?
- Credit.

544
01:19:51,292 --> 01:19:54,292
- I must have misheard.
- I could have expected it.

545
01:19:54,542 --> 01:19:58,251
- They sell on credit.
- Enough! I don't want to hear it.

546
01:19:58,501 --> 01:20:00,126
Why do you keep bowing?

547
01:20:03,167 --> 01:20:06,959
Turn your ear and listen
to the words of the wise.

548
01:20:07,209 --> 01:20:09,792
Apply your heart to my teaching.

549
01:20:10,042 --> 01:20:11,917
I sold for cash.

550
01:20:13,876 --> 01:20:17,667
Help our fellow man
as much as we can,

551
01:20:17,917 --> 01:20:21,542
but be vigilant
we don't fall ourselves.

552
01:20:36,417 --> 01:20:40,917
The seven years of plenty
will come to this land.

553
01:20:41,542 --> 01:20:48,459
It was Christian Seipel and Sons,
owners of weaving mills.

554
01:20:49,042 --> 01:20:53,042
The rich man laboured
in gathering riches,

555
01:20:53,542 --> 01:20:58,126
and when he rests he shall
be filled with his goods.

556
01:21:00,126 --> 01:21:04,917
The poor man laboured
in his low way of life,

557
01:21:05,501 --> 01:21:08,334
and in the end he is still poor.

558
01:25:29,751 --> 01:25:31,001
Come.

559
01:26:02,792 --> 01:26:05,209
She doesn't show up
in the park anymore.

560
01:26:05,459 --> 01:26:09,459
They must be guarding her.
They smelled danger.

561
01:26:09,709 --> 01:26:11,959
It's nothing but humbug!

562
01:26:12,209 --> 01:26:15,959
Extraterritoriality! Mexico!
Maximilian! Cotton plantations!

563
01:26:16,209 --> 01:26:21,459
Enough!
Who told you that?

564
01:26:21,709 --> 01:26:25,501
The files of this secret conspiracy
were never revealed.

565
01:26:25,751 --> 01:26:29,501
I'm the owner of
this stamp album.

566
01:26:30,084 --> 01:26:33,292
I won't lend it to you again
for such purposes.

567
01:26:33,542 --> 01:26:37,376
I must admit that
the whole thing is incredible.

568
01:26:37,959 --> 01:26:39,792
Unbelievable.

569
01:26:40,042 --> 01:26:42,459
What do you think, Rudolf?

570
01:26:42,709 --> 01:26:47,167
Who could have conceived
such an evil idea,

571
01:26:47,417 --> 01:26:50,584
which goes beyond any fantasy?

572
01:26:56,084 --> 01:26:58,542
I'm amazed myself.

573
01:27:02,459 --> 01:27:04,917
Tittle-tattle!
Our partnership is over!

574
01:27:05,167 --> 01:27:06,876
Suit yourself.

575
01:27:07,126 --> 01:27:11,626
I said I would prove
that it was all true.

576
01:27:35,751 --> 01:27:38,334
- Where is Mr. de V?
- He's left.

577
01:27:40,251 --> 01:27:43,417
We'll see.
Where is the infanta?

578
01:27:45,251 --> 01:27:49,042
Her Highness has left too.
Nobody is here.

579
01:27:49,292 --> 01:27:51,334
Right. Get out.

580
01:27:59,584 --> 01:28:01,792
Somebody must have
betrayed me.

581
01:28:11,876 --> 01:28:13,626
Abra...

582
01:28:15,792 --> 01:28:17,376
Abra?

583
01:28:18,167 --> 01:28:20,042
Abracadabra.

584
01:28:21,001 --> 01:28:22,459
Great.

585
01:28:22,709 --> 01:28:26,376
Come on. Get up!

586
01:28:29,501 --> 01:28:31,042
Haleiwa!

587
01:28:35,334 --> 01:28:36,626
Vienna!

588
01:28:52,417 --> 01:28:54,417
Bravo!

589
01:28:54,917 --> 01:28:58,042
Mount your horses, gentlemen!

590
01:29:00,876 --> 01:29:02,251
Haleiwa!

591
01:29:04,709 --> 01:29:08,751
- What's going on here?
- This way, Your Highness.

592
01:29:29,209 --> 01:29:30,959
Forward!

593
01:30:18,084 --> 01:30:21,667
Gentlemen,
I troubled you in vain.

594
01:30:22,417 --> 01:30:26,834
These people are free to go.
Don't harm them.

595
01:30:27,834 --> 01:30:31,959
In my blindness I wanted
to preach the scripture,

596
01:30:32,209 --> 01:30:34,251
to interpret God's will.

597
01:30:34,501 --> 01:30:38,626
My false belief made me
pursue obscure clues

598
01:30:38,876 --> 01:30:41,751
and make random conclusions.

599
01:30:42,001 --> 01:30:43,584
Allow me, my friend.

600
01:30:43,834 --> 01:30:48,084
Noble gentlemen and you, infanta.

601
01:30:48,334 --> 01:30:50,501
I hand the regency to Rudolf.

602
01:30:51,417 --> 01:30:52,959
I abdicate!

603
01:30:57,584 --> 01:31:00,042
You're free, noble gentlemen.

604
01:31:00,292 --> 01:31:03,667
Thank you in the name
of our idea.

605
01:31:05,001 --> 01:31:11,334
Our dethroned idea, which...

606
01:31:14,501 --> 01:31:15,792
Hurry!

607
01:31:16,792 --> 01:31:18,126
Hurry!

608
01:31:28,709 --> 01:31:31,084
Father!

609
01:31:31,334 --> 01:31:34,709
Call Garibaldi.
He's an expert on wounds.

610
01:31:35,751 --> 01:31:36,959
Bianca.

611
01:31:40,917 --> 01:31:42,584
Get a stretcher.

612
01:31:42,834 --> 01:31:44,709
Hurry!

613
01:31:50,917 --> 01:31:55,501
What a fatal night.
I didn't foresee it.

614
01:31:55,917 --> 01:31:59,292
He had a noble heart after all.

615
01:31:59,542 --> 01:32:01,626
I have wronged him.

616
01:32:02,584 --> 01:32:04,876
Rudolf, you must comfort Bianca,

617
01:32:05,126 --> 01:32:08,959
love her with double love
to replace her father.

618
01:32:15,209 --> 01:32:17,292
You want to take him with you?

619
01:32:18,167 --> 01:32:20,042
Let's form a procession.

620
01:32:20,792 --> 01:32:26,334
Form a procession!

621
01:33:02,917 --> 01:33:04,709
One more thing, Rudolf.

622
01:33:04,959 --> 01:33:08,542
I should be the one
to provide for the old age

623
01:33:08,792 --> 01:33:10,959
of those homeless heroes.

624
01:33:11,542 --> 01:33:13,751
Unfortunately I'm a pauper.

625
01:33:18,709 --> 01:33:21,167
- How much?
- Ten thousand.

626
01:33:25,542 --> 01:33:27,501
- Five.
- No.

627
01:33:27,959 --> 01:33:29,751
Twelve.

628
01:33:52,501 --> 01:33:58,126
Gentlemen! After what happened
no wax museum will take you in.

629
01:33:58,376 --> 01:34:00,709
Competition is big.

630
01:34:00,959 --> 01:34:03,542
As you have no practical skills,

631
01:34:03,792 --> 01:34:08,459
my friend made a donation
to purchase twelve barrel organs.

632
01:34:08,709 --> 01:34:13,709
Go around the world
and play to make people happy.

633
01:34:13,959 --> 01:34:16,667
You can choose the music.

634
01:34:17,834 --> 01:34:23,167
Now, dear friends
and noble gentlemen,

635
01:34:23,709 --> 01:34:29,626
let's cheer together:
Long live the newlyweds!

636
01:34:40,167 --> 01:34:41,876
Farewell, gentlemen.

637
01:34:42,751 --> 01:34:47,709
May what you see
be a warning to you.

638
01:34:47,959 --> 01:34:53,626
Don't ever try to guess
God's intentions.

639
01:34:54,917 --> 01:34:58,376
Ignorabimus, gentlemen.

640
01:34:58,626 --> 01:35:00,292
Ignorabimus.

641
01:35:05,709 --> 01:35:08,876
Are you Józef, Jakub's son?

642
01:35:09,959 --> 01:35:11,126
Maybe. Yes.

643
01:35:11,376 --> 01:35:15,959
Did you dream the standard
dream of biblical Joseph?

644
01:35:17,042 --> 01:35:18,626
Maybe.

645
01:35:21,042 --> 01:35:22,626
Well?

646
01:35:23,792 --> 01:35:28,126
Do you know that your dream
was noticed at the highest level

647
01:35:28,376 --> 01:35:30,417
and was severely criticized?

648
01:35:30,667 --> 01:35:32,834
I'm not responsible for my dreams.

649
01:35:33,084 --> 01:35:34,792
Yes, you are.

650
01:35:35,042 --> 01:35:40,126
You are under arrest in the name
of His Imperial and Royal Majesty.

651
01:35:41,084 --> 01:35:42,834
I'm at your disposal.

652
01:35:46,126 --> 01:35:50,751
His Imperial and Royal Majesty's
bureaucracy is a bit slow.

653
01:35:51,209 --> 01:35:55,751
I have surpassed that early dream
with more serious deeds.

654
01:35:56,001 --> 01:35:58,834
I wanted to do justice
and kill myself.

655
01:35:59,084 --> 01:36:03,042
Now that obsolete dream
has saved my life!

656
01:36:22,209 --> 01:36:25,292
- Don't cry.
- I have a migraine.

657
01:36:28,626 --> 01:36:31,334
Come. We'll make tea.

658
01:36:39,792 --> 01:36:41,792
Is Adela at home?

659
01:36:42,042 --> 01:36:44,792
Adela left to America.

660
01:36:46,209 --> 01:36:47,959
She left?

661
01:36:49,792 --> 01:36:54,417
She went by ship and it sank.
All passengers died.

662
01:36:54,667 --> 01:36:57,001
We never heard from her again.

663
01:36:57,959 --> 01:37:01,876
What about father?
Where is he?

664
01:37:04,251 --> 01:37:10,917
He left many times,
but it was never final.

665
01:37:11,834 --> 01:37:14,667
It had its good points.

666
01:37:15,001 --> 01:37:20,584
This way he prepared us
for his ultimate departure.

667
01:37:42,792 --> 01:37:44,792
Take me to him.

668
01:37:46,709 --> 01:37:48,209
All right.

669
01:37:51,167 --> 01:37:55,709
I think it's time for you
to see him.

670
01:38:03,792 --> 01:38:05,667
The shop is closed for good.

671
01:38:06,084 --> 01:38:10,376
Sometimes I go down there
to sell the remnants.

672
01:38:12,209 --> 01:38:15,334
But the shutters
are only half-open.

673
01:39:05,001 --> 01:39:07,167
He was one of those

674
01:39:07,501 --> 01:39:12,751
whose face was touched by
the hand of God while sleeping.

675
01:39:14,334 --> 01:39:18,209
They know
what they don't know.

676
01:39:19,459 --> 01:39:24,876
They become speculative
and suspicious.

677
01:39:27,834 --> 01:39:32,167
Through closed eyelids

678
01:39:32,417 --> 01:39:39,209
they see images of distant worlds.

679
01:40:02,417 --> 01:40:06,667
For man goes to his eternal home,

680
01:40:07,959 --> 01:40:11,542
while mourners go about
in the street.

681
01:40:12,751 --> 01:40:16,126
Before the silver cord is broken,

682
01:40:16,959 --> 01:40:19,709
and the golden bowl is crushed.

683
01:40:21,501 --> 01:40:24,876
The pitcher by the well is broken,

684
01:40:26,042 --> 01:40:29,251
and the wheel at
the cistern is crushed.

685
01:40:29,501 --> 01:40:34,376
Then the dust will return
to the earth as it was.

686
01:40:35,167 --> 01:40:39,834
And the spirit will return
to God who gave it.

687
01:41:08,251 --> 01:41:15,459
I'm so glad to see you, Józef.
What a surprise.

688
01:41:16,501 --> 01:41:18,667
I feel so lonely here.

689
01:41:19,584 --> 01:41:25,209
Although I can't complain.
I've been through worse things.

690
01:41:28,876 --> 01:41:31,167
I must tell you something.

691
01:41:36,251 --> 01:41:38,709
But don't laugh.

692
01:41:38,959 --> 01:41:42,334
I rented a place for a shop here.

693
01:41:43,417 --> 01:41:48,292
It's nothing much.

694
01:41:49,042 --> 01:41:52,626
Back home I'd be ashamed
to have a stall like that.

695
01:41:52,876 --> 01:41:58,626
But here we had to pull
in our horns.

696
01:41:59,042 --> 01:42:01,459
Isn't that right, Józef?

697
01:42:02,376 --> 01:42:05,209
Life goes on.

698
01:42:09,876 --> 01:42:12,917
I must have overvvound it.

699
01:42:16,459 --> 01:42:18,751
I see you're sleepy.

700
01:42:19,417 --> 01:42:21,584
Go back to sleep.

701
01:42:23,251 --> 01:42:30,792
You have no idea
how hard it was to get a loan.

702
01:42:31,251 --> 01:42:34,292
People here
don't trust old merchants.

703
01:42:34,542 --> 01:42:37,751
Merchants with past experience.

704
01:42:40,251 --> 01:42:44,376
Do you remember the optician's
shop in the market square?

705
01:42:45,501 --> 01:42:48,417
Our shop is right next door.

706
01:42:50,084 --> 01:42:53,709
We don't have a sign yet.
But you'll find it.

707
01:43:00,626 --> 01:43:03,001
You're going out without your coat?

708
01:43:03,251 --> 01:43:07,417
I couldn't find it in my trunk.
They forgot to pack it.

709
01:43:09,459 --> 01:43:11,251
Take my coat.

710
01:43:12,542 --> 01:43:14,917
No. See you.

711
01:47:22,251 --> 01:47:24,584
Jakub! Go on, trade.

712
01:47:49,626 --> 01:47:52,334
Why don't you sit down, father?

713
01:47:53,542 --> 01:47:57,417
You're ill. You should
take care of yourself.

714
01:47:58,709 --> 01:48:02,584
Stop bothering me.
I'm busy.

715
01:48:25,709 --> 01:48:31,959
A letter came for you.
It's on my desk among papers.

716
01:50:44,501 --> 01:50:47,876
On my first day here
I was served

717
01:50:48,126 --> 01:50:52,834
an excellent fillet of beef
with mushrooms.

718
01:50:54,334 --> 01:50:57,126
It was a hell of a piece of meat.

719
01:50:57,376 --> 01:50:59,251
I have to warn you.

720
01:50:59,501 --> 01:51:03,209
If they ever want to
serve you fillet of beef...

721
01:51:07,959 --> 01:51:10,834
Fillet of beef...

722
01:51:12,792 --> 01:51:16,584
I still feel fire in my stomach.

723
01:51:18,001 --> 01:51:21,001
I have diarrhea after diarrhea.

724
01:51:21,251 --> 01:51:23,709
It's really tough.

725
01:51:23,959 --> 01:51:28,376
Or take, for instance,
hunter-style roast,

726
01:51:28,626 --> 01:51:33,709
stuffed with pate with gravy.

727
01:51:35,376 --> 01:51:39,459
Here we don't have to deny
ourselves anything.

728
01:51:39,709 --> 01:51:44,084
We can afford
to indulge big style.

729
01:51:47,084 --> 01:51:50,209
An angel of a boy.
So precious.

730
01:51:54,334 --> 01:51:57,459
You must admit he's charming.

731
01:52:02,751 --> 01:52:03,792
Got a light?

732
01:52:08,209 --> 01:52:13,167
Even schoolgirls here wear
bows in a special manner.

733
01:52:13,459 --> 01:52:20,334
If you as much as glance at them,
you get that sultry look...

734
01:52:22,626 --> 01:52:27,084
which fills us with desire.

735
01:53:15,751 --> 01:53:17,917
I have to see the doctor.

736
01:53:19,959 --> 01:53:22,542
He's at the restaurant.

737
01:53:24,001 --> 01:53:26,167
I've just been there.

738
01:53:26,417 --> 01:53:29,792
Sorry.
I meant the operating room.

739
01:53:30,876 --> 01:53:34,709
We're evidently in a trap.

740
01:53:37,417 --> 01:53:41,459
Ever since I came here,
the sanatorium personnel

741
01:53:41,709 --> 01:53:45,459
hasn't done anything
to provide proper care.

742
01:53:45,709 --> 01:53:48,667
We're left to ourselves.

743
01:53:48,917 --> 01:53:53,209
I can't get a bed,
not to mention clean linen.

744
01:54:02,167 --> 01:54:07,459
Those secrets and discreet looks
of yours are just a mystification.

745
01:54:07,709 --> 01:54:11,959
I feel like opening all those
doors to expose the intrigue

746
01:54:12,209 --> 01:54:13,917
we got involved in.

747
01:54:16,834 --> 01:54:21,209
Get some sleep.
You can hardly keep on your feet.

748
01:55:29,042 --> 01:55:31,751
Józef, Józef...

749
01:55:33,126 --> 01:55:36,709
I've been lying in bed here,
left without any care.

750
01:55:36,959 --> 01:55:39,667
The wires have been cut.

751
01:55:41,209 --> 01:55:43,626
Nobody comes to see me.

752
01:55:43,959 --> 01:55:50,209
Nobody can make me
a cup of tea.

753
01:56:02,501 --> 01:56:08,792
My own son has
abandoned his sick father

754
01:56:09,667 --> 01:56:12,751
to chase girls in town.

755
01:56:13,751 --> 01:56:21,626
Józef, you should go
to our shop more often.

756
01:56:23,751 --> 01:56:28,042
The shop assistants
are stealing from us.

757
01:56:29,126 --> 01:56:33,292
Our shop will go to waste

758
01:56:34,167 --> 01:56:38,042
if nobody takes care of it.

759
01:56:39,792 --> 01:56:43,709
Look, my heart is pounding.

760
01:56:45,459 --> 01:56:48,876
My strength is leaving me.

761
01:57:03,917 --> 01:57:13,042
Józef, was there
any mail from home?

762
01:57:55,084 --> 01:57:56,542
Doctor...

763
01:57:56,792 --> 01:57:59,834
You're not looking well.
Take your jacket off.

764
01:58:00,084 --> 01:58:01,709
I'll examine you.

765
01:58:02,709 --> 01:58:06,001
Your irritation is justified.

766
01:58:06,251 --> 01:58:09,126
Your body,
especially your nervous system

767
01:58:09,376 --> 01:58:11,959
has to adjust to new conditions.

768
01:58:20,042 --> 01:58:23,417
We were deceived by an ad.

769
01:58:23,667 --> 01:58:27,751
It wasn't a good idea
to send my father here.

770
01:58:28,001 --> 01:58:29,751
Moving back time!

771
01:58:32,209 --> 01:58:36,834
It sounds good.
But what is it in fact?

772
01:58:37,084 --> 01:58:41,292
Do we get fully valuable
and credible time here?

773
01:58:42,251 --> 01:58:46,167
No. We get time
used up by people.

774
01:58:46,417 --> 01:58:48,667
It's frayed and full of holes.

775
01:58:48,917 --> 01:58:54,167
It's vomited, secondhand time!

776
01:58:54,459 --> 01:59:00,459
You may question the quality
of your father's existence,

777
01:59:00,876 --> 01:59:04,084
but you can see him
and talk to him.

778
01:59:05,917 --> 01:59:09,042
You should be
very grateful to the doctor.

779
01:59:09,292 --> 01:59:13,209
Enough! Space is for people.

780
01:59:13,459 --> 01:59:16,459
In space you can swing around,
turn somersaults,

781
01:59:16,709 --> 01:59:18,251
jump from one star to another.

782
01:59:18,501 --> 01:59:20,917
But don't tamper with time!

783
01:59:21,334 --> 01:59:26,084
The blame for this lies
in fast decomposition...

784
01:59:32,959 --> 01:59:34,709
Of time.

785
01:59:39,042 --> 01:59:42,251
We all know that

786
01:59:42,501 --> 01:59:49,584
this chaotic element can be
kept within certain bounds

787
01:59:53,042 --> 01:59:58,709
if regulated continually.

788
02:00:01,209 --> 02:00:05,001
If not, it begins to play
all kinds of tricks.

789
02:00:05,251 --> 02:00:06,876
Isn't that right?

790
02:00:07,917 --> 02:00:11,042
You should take better
care of yourself.

791
02:00:11,292 --> 02:00:13,959
Wear warmer clothes.

792
02:00:14,209 --> 02:00:21,209
To start with, get some exercise.
Later we'll see.

793
02:00:24,417 --> 02:00:26,042
Chin up!

794
02:00:35,751 --> 02:00:40,126
It's lucky that father
is no longer alive.

795
02:00:41,417 --> 02:00:43,917
It won't affect him anymore.
