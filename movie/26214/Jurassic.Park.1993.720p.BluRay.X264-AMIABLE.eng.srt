1
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,749
Everybody, heads up. Keep it clear, now.

2
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,377
Keep it clear.

3
00:01:30,627 --> 00:01:33,797
Stand back.

4
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:47,144
Slow it down.

5
00:01:56,111 --> 00:01:59,280
-Pushing team, move in there.
-Move in.

6
00:01:59,531 --> 00:02:03,994
-On your ready.
-I want tasers on full charge.

7
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,497
Steady! Go on. Step back in.

8
00:02:07,747 --> 00:02:10,375
Ready. Move it.

9
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:13,503
And push!

10
00:02:18,633 --> 00:02:22,971
Well, locked. Loading team, step away.

11
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:33,816
Jophery, raise the gate.

12
00:02:50,081 --> 00:02:54,210
Block the opening! Don't let her get out!

13
00:03:02,052 --> 00:03:03,553
Somebody help him!

14
00:03:03,803 --> 00:03:07,182
Work her back!

15
00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:19,736
Shoot her!

16
00:03:20,237 --> 00:03:23,282
Shoot her!

17
00:03:57,023 --> 00:04:00,193
-I heard that Hammond's not even here.
-He sends his apologies.

18
00:04:00,443 --> 00:04:03,363
There's a $20 million lawsuit
for that worker's death...

19
00:04:03,613 --> 00:04:06,032
...and you're telling me
that Hammond can't see me?

20
00:04:06,283 --> 00:04:09,244
He had to leave early,
his daughter's getting a divorce.

21
00:04:09,494 --> 00:04:12,372
I understand, but we need to deal
with the situation now.

22
00:04:12,622 --> 00:04:16,335
-The insurance company--
-You okay?

23
00:04:17,336 --> 00:04:22,131
The underwriters feel that the accident's
raised safety questions about the park.

24
00:04:22,381 --> 00:04:24,342
That makes the investors very anxious.

25
00:04:24,592 --> 00:04:29,722
I had to promise to conduct
a thorough, on-site inspection.

26
00:04:29,764 --> 00:04:32,266
Hammond hates inspections.
They slow everything down.

27
00:04:32,517 --> 00:04:37,146
They'll pull the funding.
That'll slow him down even more.

28
00:04:41,776 --> 00:04:43,361
Watch your head.

29
00:04:43,611 --> 00:04:48,783
If two experts sign off on the island,
the insurance guys'll back off.

30
00:04:49,034 --> 00:04:51,911
I've already got lan Malcolm,
but they think he's too trendy.

31
00:04:52,162 --> 00:04:53,580
-They want Alan Grant.
-Grant?

32
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,333
You'll never get him out of Montana.

33
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:59,127
Why not?

34
00:04:59,961 --> 00:05:02,589
Why not?

35
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:07,135
Because Grant's like me.

36
00:05:07,469 --> 00:05:10,430
He's a digger.

37
00:05:53,598 --> 00:05:57,519
Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler,
we're ready to try again.

38
00:05:57,769 --> 00:05:59,479
I hate computers.

39
00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:02,858
The feeling's mutual.

40
00:06:16,287 --> 00:06:19,040
Take a look.

41
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:21,459
Did it work?

42
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:24,629
-How long does this take?
-Should bring an immediate return.

43
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:29,384
You shoot the radar into the ground,
and the bone bounces the image back.

44
00:06:29,634 --> 00:06:32,679
Bounces it back....

45
00:06:33,221 --> 00:06:35,557
This new program is incredible.

46
00:06:35,807 --> 00:06:39,144
A few more years' development,
and we won't even have to dig anymore.

47
00:06:39,394 --> 00:06:41,438
Where's the fun in that?

48
00:06:41,688 --> 00:06:45,942
It's a little distorted,
but I don't think it's the computer.

49
00:06:46,192 --> 00:06:49,696
Post-mortem contraction
of the posterior neck ligaments.

50
00:06:49,946 --> 00:06:50,864
Velociraptor?

51
00:06:51,114 --> 00:06:52,824
Yes. Good shape, too.

52
00:06:53,074 --> 00:06:56,035
It's 5, 6 feet high. I'm guessing 9 feet long.

53
00:06:56,285 --> 00:06:57,453
-Look--
-What'd you do?

54
00:06:57,703 --> 00:06:58,871
He touched it.

55
00:06:59,121 --> 00:07:03,793
-Dr. Grant's not machine compatible.
-Hell, they've got it in for me.

56
00:07:04,043 --> 00:07:06,504
And look at the half-moon shaped bones
in the wrist.

57
00:07:06,754 --> 00:07:10,758
It's no wonder these guys learned
how to fly.

58
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:14,011
No, seriously.

59
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,392
Maybe dinosaurs have more in common
with present-day birds than with reptiles.

60
00:07:19,642 --> 00:07:22,770
Look at the pubic bone, turned backward,
like a bird's.

61
00:07:23,021 --> 00:07:27,358
Look at the vertebrae,
full of air sacs and hollows, like a bird's.

62
00:07:27,609 --> 00:07:30,487
And even the word "raptor"
means "bird of prey."

63
00:07:30,737 --> 00:07:34,240
That doesn't look very scary.

64
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,661
More like a 6-foot turkey.

65
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:42,457
A turkey?

66
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:47,127
-Imagine yourself in the Cretaceous period.
-Here we go.

67
00:07:47,378 --> 00:07:51,423
You'd get your first look at this
6-foot turkey as you enter a clearing.

68
00:07:51,674 --> 00:07:54,677
He moves like a bird,
lightly bobbing his head.

69
00:07:54,927 --> 00:07:58,973
You keep still because maybe
his visual acuity is based on movement...

70
00:07:59,223 --> 00:08:01,851
...like T. Rex and he'll lose you
if you don't move.

71
00:08:02,101 --> 00:08:04,687
But no, not Velociraptor.

72
00:08:04,937 --> 00:08:09,317
You stare at him
and he just stares right back.

73
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:14,489
And that's when the attack comes.
Not from the front, but from the side.

74
00:08:14,739 --> 00:08:19,869
From the other two Raptors
you didn't even know were there.

75
00:08:19,911 --> 00:08:24,749
Because Velociraptor's a pack hunter.
He uses co-ordinated attack patterns...

76
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:28,002
...and he is out in force today.

77
00:08:28,253 --> 00:08:31,047
And he slashes at you with this...

78
00:08:31,297 --> 00:08:35,342
...a 6-inch retractable claw,
like a razor, on the middle toe.

79
00:08:35,592 --> 00:08:39,638
He doesn't bother to bite your jugular
like a lion. No.

80
00:08:39,888 --> 00:08:42,057
He slashes at you...

81
00:08:42,308 --> 00:08:44,226
...here or here....

82
00:08:44,476 --> 00:08:46,145
Alan.

83
00:08:46,395 --> 00:08:51,192
Or maybe across the belly,
spilling your intestines.

84
00:08:51,442 --> 00:08:57,823
The point is, you are alive
when they start to eat you.

85
00:08:58,032 --> 00:09:01,953
So, you know, try to show a little respect.

86
00:09:02,203 --> 00:09:04,664
Okay.

87
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:15,508
Alan, if you wanted to scare the kid,
you could've pulled a gun on him.

88
00:09:15,758 --> 00:09:18,720
Yeah, I know. Kids.

89
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,889
You want to have one of those?

90
00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:26,560
I don't want that kid,
but a breed of child could be intriguing.

91
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,604
I mean, what's so wrong with kids?

92
00:09:28,854 --> 00:09:33,108
They're noisy, they're messy,
they're expensive.

93
00:09:33,359 --> 00:09:34,693
Cheap, cheap.

94
00:09:34,943 --> 00:09:36,320
They smell.

95
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,947
-They don't smell!
-Some smell.

96
00:09:38,197 --> 00:09:42,034
-Give me a break!
-Babies smell.

97
00:09:48,082 --> 00:09:49,959
-Cover the site!
-Cover up the dig!

98
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:52,878
-Tell them to shut down!
-Cut the machine!

99
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:57,008
Cover it all up. Pull it over.

100
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,304
Just cut it, will you? Shut it down!

101
00:10:01,554 --> 00:10:04,140
What?

102
00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:20,572
What the hell do you think
you're doing in here?

103
00:10:20,823 --> 00:10:23,367
We were saving that.

104
00:10:23,617 --> 00:10:27,287
For today, I guarantee it.

105
00:10:27,371 --> 00:10:30,165
-Who in God's name do you think you are?
-John Hammond.

106
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:34,753
And I'm delighted to meet you finally
in person, Dr. Grant.

107
00:10:35,004 --> 00:10:40,301
So, I can see that my $50,000 a year
has been well spent.

108
00:10:40,551 --> 00:10:41,594
Who's the jerk?

109
00:10:41,844 --> 00:10:45,306
-This is our paleobotanist. Dr.--
-Sattler.

110
00:10:45,556 --> 00:10:47,933
Ellie, this is Mr. Hammond.

111
00:10:48,184 --> 00:10:50,936
I'm sorry about the dramatic entrance,
Dr. Sattler, but...

112
00:10:51,187 --> 00:10:53,022
-Did I say jerk?
-...we're in a hurry.

113
00:10:53,272 --> 00:10:57,109
Will you have a drink?
We won't let it get warm. Sit down.

114
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,446
-Let me have this.
-I'll just get a glass or two. I can do it.

115
00:11:00,696 --> 00:11:03,825
-There's samples all over here.
-I know my way around the kitchen.

116
00:11:04,075 --> 00:11:07,536
Now, I'll get right to the point.

117
00:11:07,703 --> 00:11:10,205
I like you. Both of you.

118
00:11:10,455 --> 00:11:15,252
I can tell instantly about people. It's a gift.

119
00:11:16,962 --> 00:11:20,382
I own an island off the coast of Costa Rica.

120
00:11:20,632 --> 00:11:23,886
I've leased it from the government
and during the last five years...

121
00:11:24,136 --> 00:11:26,472
...I've been setting up a biological preserve.

122
00:11:26,722 --> 00:11:28,932
Really spectacular. Spared no expense.

123
00:11:29,183 --> 00:11:32,478
Make the one I've got down in Kenya
look like a petting zoo.

124
00:11:32,728 --> 00:11:36,982
And there's no doubt our attractions
will drive kids out of their minds.

125
00:11:37,233 --> 00:11:40,194
-And what are those?
-Small versions of adults, honey.

126
00:11:40,444 --> 00:11:42,405
And not just kids, everyone.

127
00:11:42,655 --> 00:11:48,703
We're opening next year, if the lawyers
don't kill me first. Do you like lawyers?

128
00:11:48,953 --> 00:11:51,872
-I don't really know any.
-Don't really know any.

129
00:11:52,123 --> 00:11:56,960
I do, and there's a particular one right now,
who represents my investors.

130
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,880
Says that they insist on outside opinions.

131
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,631
What kind of opinions?

132
00:12:01,882 --> 00:12:04,718
Well, your kind,
not to put too fine a point on it.

133
00:12:04,968 --> 00:12:09,139
Let's face it, in your particular fields,
you're the top minds.

134
00:12:09,389 --> 00:12:11,808
And if I could just persuade you...

135
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:15,062
...to sign off on the park,
give it your endorsement...

136
00:12:15,312 --> 00:12:21,276
...maybe even pen a wee testimonial,
I could get back on schedule.

137
00:12:21,318 --> 00:12:26,490
-Why would they care what we think?
-What kind of park is this?

138
00:12:27,491 --> 00:12:30,744
It's right up your alley.

139
00:12:31,954 --> 00:12:35,166
Why don't you come down,
just the pair of you, for the weekend?

140
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:38,794
I'd love to have an opinion
of a paleobotanist as well.

141
00:12:39,044 --> 00:12:43,090
I've got a jet standing by at Choteau.

142
00:12:43,507 --> 00:12:46,427
I'm sorry. This isn't possible.

143
00:12:46,677 --> 00:12:48,178
We just dug up a new skeleton--

144
00:12:48,428 --> 00:12:52,599
I'd compensate you
by fully funding your dig...

145
00:12:52,849 --> 00:12:55,435
-This is a very unusual time.
-The timing is--

146
00:12:55,685 --> 00:12:59,564
...for a further three years.

147
00:13:03,026 --> 00:13:05,612
Where's the plane?

148
00:13:05,862 --> 00:13:06,863
-Okay.
-Three years.

149
00:13:07,114 --> 00:13:09,700
Cheers.

150
00:13:50,615 --> 00:13:53,243
Dodgson!

151
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,628
You shouldn't use my name.

152
00:14:02,878 --> 00:14:06,590
Dodgson. We've got Dodgson here.

153
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,927
See, nobody cares. Nice hat.

154
00:14:10,177 --> 00:14:13,055
What're you trying to look like,
a secret agent?

155
00:14:13,305 --> 00:14:15,140
-Well?
-$750,000.

156
00:14:15,391 --> 00:14:17,685
On delivery, $50,000 more
for each viable embryo.

157
00:14:17,935 --> 00:14:20,896
That's $1.5 million
if you get all 15 species off the island.

158
00:14:21,146 --> 00:14:22,022
I'll get them all.

159
00:14:22,273 --> 00:14:26,026
Remember, viable embryos.
They're no use to us if they don't survive.

160
00:14:26,277 --> 00:14:30,071
How am I supposed to transport them?

161
00:14:32,282 --> 00:14:35,160
The bottom screws open.

162
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,162
That's great. Oh, my God.

163
00:14:37,412 --> 00:14:39,914
It's cooled and compartmentalised inside.

164
00:14:40,165 --> 00:14:43,418
-You guys. That's great.
-Customs can even check it if they want to.

165
00:14:43,668 --> 00:14:45,629
-Let me see.
-Go on.

166
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:48,799
-There's enough coolant for 36 hours.
-No menthol?

167
00:14:49,049 --> 00:14:51,968
The embryos have to be back here
in San Jos?by then.

168
00:14:52,219 --> 00:14:53,804
That's up to your guy on the boat.

169
00:14:54,054 --> 00:14:57,599
7:00 tomorrow night on the east dock.
Make sure he gets it right.

170
00:14:57,849 --> 00:15:01,728
-How are you planning to beat security?
-I've got an 18-minute window.

171
00:15:01,979 --> 00:15:07,151
18 minutes and your company
catches up on 10 years of research.

172
00:15:09,987 --> 00:15:13,532
Don't get cheap on me, Dodgson.

173
00:15:14,533 --> 00:15:17,911
That was Hammond's mistake.

174
00:15:30,632 --> 00:15:34,970
So you two dig up dinosaurs?

175
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,182
-Well....
-We try to.

176
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:46,440
You'll have to get used to Dr. Malcolm.

177
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:50,902
He suffers from a deplorable excess
of personality, for a mathematician.

178
00:15:51,153 --> 00:15:52,946
Chaotician. Chaotician, actually.

179
00:15:53,196 --> 00:15:54,823
John doesn't subscribe to chaos...

180
00:15:55,073 --> 00:15:57,701
...particularly what it says
about his science project.

181
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:01,121
Ian, you've never been able to
sufficiently explain your concerns--

182
00:16:01,371 --> 00:16:04,082
Because of the behaviour
of the system in phase space?

183
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:07,586
A load, if I may say so,
of fashionable number crunching--

184
00:16:07,836 --> 00:16:08,796
Don't.

185
00:16:09,046 --> 00:16:12,173
Dr. Sattler, Dr. Grant,
you've heard of Chaos Theory?

186
00:16:12,423 --> 00:16:13,216
No.

187
00:16:13,466 --> 00:16:15,969
No? Non-linear equations?

188
00:16:16,219 --> 00:16:19,264
Strange attractors?

189
00:16:19,722 --> 00:16:25,895
I refuse to believe that you aren't familiar
with the concept of attraction.

190
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:33,278
I bring scientists. You bring a rock star.

191
00:16:36,197 --> 00:16:38,783
There it is.

192
00:17:05,143 --> 00:17:11,441
Bad wind shears. We have to drop
pretty fast. Hold on, this will be thrilling.

193
00:17:37,717 --> 00:17:40,220
But you need that piece over here,
and that piece....

194
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:44,266
We'll have landed
by the time you get it right.

195
00:17:44,516 --> 00:17:47,269
Great.

196
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,222
The full 50 miles of perimeter fence
are in place?

197
00:19:06,472 --> 00:19:09,517
And the concrete moats,
and the motion-sensor tracking systems.

198
00:19:09,767 --> 00:19:12,979
Donald, dear boy, relax.
Try and enjoy yourself.

199
00:19:13,229 --> 00:19:15,982
Let's get this straight.
This is not a weekend excursion.

200
00:19:16,232 --> 00:19:19,152
This is a serious investigation
of the stability of the island.

201
00:19:19,402 --> 00:19:22,364
Your investors, whom I represent,
are deeply concerned.

202
00:19:22,614 --> 00:19:25,700
48 hours from now,
if they're not convinced, I'm not convinced.

203
00:19:25,951 --> 00:19:28,036
I'll shut you down, John.

204
00:19:28,286 --> 00:19:33,999
In 48 hours,
I'll be accepting your apologies.

205
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:45,636
All right, slow down. Slow. Stop.

206
00:19:46,304 --> 00:19:49,348
This shouldn't be here.

207
00:20:07,826 --> 00:20:10,495
Alan, this species of veriforman
has been extinct, since...

208
00:20:10,745 --> 00:20:13,331
...the Cretaceous Period.
I mean, this thing....

209
00:20:13,581 --> 00:20:16,459
What?

210
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:47,365
Look at that.

211
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,954
It's a dinosaur.

212
00:20:55,581 --> 00:21:00,003
You did it. Crazy son of a bitch, you did it.

213
00:21:00,253 --> 00:21:03,673
We could tear up the rule book
on cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply.

214
00:21:03,923 --> 00:21:06,134
They're wrong.
This is a warm-blooded creature.

215
00:21:06,384 --> 00:21:09,929
-This thing doesn't live in a swamp.
-This thing's got a 25, 27-foot neck?

216
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:14,266
-The Brachiosaurus? 30.
-30 feet.

217
00:21:29,323 --> 00:21:33,411
We're gonna make a fortune
with this place.

218
00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:38,124
How fast are they?

219
00:21:38,374 --> 00:21:43,129
Well, we clocked the T. Rex
at 32 miles an hour.

220
00:21:43,463 --> 00:21:45,715
T. Rex?

221
00:21:45,965 --> 00:21:48,801
You said you've got a T. Rex?

222
00:21:49,052 --> 00:21:50,970
Say again.

223
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,098
We have a T. Rex.

224
00:21:54,515 --> 00:21:56,851
Put your head between your knees.

225
00:21:57,101 --> 00:21:58,561
Dr. Grant...

226
00:21:58,811 --> 00:22:00,855
...my dear Dr. Sattler...

227
00:22:01,105 --> 00:22:06,485
...welcome to Jurassic Park.

228
00:22:27,965 --> 00:22:31,302
They're moving in herds.

229
00:22:32,011 --> 00:22:35,139
They do move in herds.

230
00:22:41,646 --> 00:22:44,816
How did you do this?

231
00:22:46,067 --> 00:22:48,945
I'll show you.

232
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,969
G'day.

233
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:18,057
The most advanced amusement park
in the entire world...

234
00:23:18,307 --> 00:23:20,684
...incorporating all the latest technologies.

235
00:23:20,935 --> 00:23:24,063
And I'm not talking just about rides.
Everybody has rides.

236
00:23:24,313 --> 00:23:28,442
No, we've made living
biological attractions so astounding...

237
00:23:28,693 --> 00:23:32,363
...that they'll capture the imagination
of the entire planet.

238
00:23:32,613 --> 00:23:35,408
So, what are you thinking?

239
00:23:35,658 --> 00:23:40,121
-That we're out of a job.
-Don't you mean "extinct"?

240
00:23:46,668 --> 00:23:51,298
Why don't you all sit down?
Donald, sit down.

241
00:23:51,548 --> 00:23:56,178
Here he comes. Well, here I come.

242
00:23:59,306 --> 00:24:01,058
<i>Hello.</i>

243
00:24:01,308 --> 00:24:02,476
Say hello.

244
00:24:02,726 --> 00:24:04,812
Hello.

245
00:24:05,062 --> 00:24:06,689
<i>Hello, John.</i>

246
00:24:06,939 --> 00:24:08,565
Yes, I've got lines.

247
00:24:08,816 --> 00:24:13,529
<i>Well, fine, I guess.
But, how did I get here?</i>

248
00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:17,741
Well, let me show you.
First, I'll need a drop of blood.

249
00:24:17,992 --> 00:24:18,951
Your blood.

250
00:24:19,201 --> 00:24:21,746
<i>Right.</i>

251
00:24:22,038 --> 00:24:23,456
<i>That hurt.</i>

252
00:24:23,706 --> 00:24:26,751
Relax, John.
It's all part of the miracle of cloning.

253
00:24:27,001 --> 00:24:30,463
<i>Hello, John.</i>

254
00:24:30,922 --> 00:24:34,841
Cloned from what? Loy extraction
hasn't recreated an intact DNA strand.

255
00:24:35,091 --> 00:24:37,010
Not without massive sequence gaps.

256
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,596
Paleo DNA, from what source?

257
00:24:39,846 --> 00:24:44,810
Where do you get 100 million-year-old
dinosaur blood?

258
00:24:48,105 --> 00:24:49,815
<i>What? What?</i>

259
00:24:50,065 --> 00:24:52,943
<i>Well, Mr. DNA, where did you come from?</i>

260
00:24:53,193 --> 00:24:54,319
<i>From your blood.</i>

261
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:58,949
<i>Just one drop of your blood
contains billions of strands of DNA...</i>

262
00:24:59,199 --> 00:25:01,952
<i>...the building blocks of life.</i>

263
00:25:02,202 --> 00:25:06,832
<i>A DNA strand like me
is a blueprint for building a living thing.</i>

264
00:25:07,082 --> 00:25:12,338
<i>And sometimes animals that went extinct
millions of years ago, like dinosaurs...</i>

265
00:25:12,588 --> 00:25:17,468
<i>...left their blueprints behind for us to find.
We just had to know where to look.</i>

266
00:25:17,718 --> 00:25:22,431
<i>100 million years ago,
there were mosquitoes just like today.</i>

267
00:25:22,682 --> 00:25:26,017
<i>And just like today,
they fed on the blood of animals.</i>

268
00:25:26,268 --> 00:25:30,897
<i>Even dinosaurs.
Sometimes, after biting a dinosaur...</i>

269
00:25:31,148 --> 00:25:35,736
<i>...mosquitoes would land on the branch
of a tree and get stuck in the sap.</i>

270
00:25:35,986 --> 00:25:40,782
<i>After a long time, the tree sap
would get hard and become fossilised...</i>

271
00:25:41,033 --> 00:25:46,371
<i>...just like a dinosaur bone,
preserving the mosquito inside.</i>

272
00:25:46,622 --> 00:25:50,250
<i>This fossilised tree sap,
which we call amber...</i>

273
00:25:50,501 --> 00:25:54,713
<i>...waited for millions of years
with the mosquito inside...</i>

274
00:25:54,963 --> 00:25:58,634
<i>...until Jurassic Park scientists came along.</i>

275
00:25:58,884 --> 00:26:02,930
<i>Using sophisticated techniques,
they extract the preserved blood...</i>

276
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:08,394
<i>...from the mosquito,
and bingo: dino DNA!</i>

277
00:26:08,644 --> 00:26:13,274
<i>A full DNA strand contains
three billion genetic codes.</i>

278
00:26:13,524 --> 00:26:17,485
<i>If we looked at screens like these
once a second for eight hours a day...</i>

279
00:26:17,736 --> 00:26:21,740
<i>...it'd take two years
to look at the entire DNA strand.</i>

280
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:27,037
<i>It's that long.
Since it's so old, it's full of holes.</i>

281
00:26:27,287 --> 00:26:30,248
<i>Now that's where our geneticists
take over.</i>

282
00:26:30,499 --> 00:26:33,585
<i>Thinking machine super-computers
and gene sequencers...</i>

283
00:26:33,835 --> 00:26:36,213
<i>...break down the strand in minutes.</i>

284
00:26:36,463 --> 00:26:38,340
<i>And virtual-reality displays...</i>

285
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:42,094
<i>...show our geneticists the gaps
in the DNA sequence.</i>

286
00:26:42,344 --> 00:26:44,680
<i>We used the complete DNA of a frog...</i>

287
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:49,184
<i>...to fill in the holes and complete the code.</i>

288
00:26:49,435 --> 00:26:55,149
<i>Whew! And now,
we can make a baby dinosaur.</i>

289
00:26:56,775 --> 00:27:01,155
This score is only temporary.
It all has very dramatic music, of course.

290
00:27:01,405 --> 00:27:03,824
A march or something.
It hasn't been written yet.

291
00:27:04,074 --> 00:27:07,160
And then, the tour moves on.

292
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:20,090
<i>Well, look here.
Those hard-working cowpokes....</i>

293
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,634
This is overwhelming, John.

294
00:27:22,884 --> 00:27:26,763
Are these characters autoerotica?

295
00:27:27,013 --> 00:27:29,683
No, we have no animatronics here.

296
00:27:29,933 --> 00:27:33,103
Those people are the real miracle workers
of Jurassic Park.

297
00:27:33,353 --> 00:27:37,107
<i>...in unfertilised emu or ostrich eggs.</i>

298
00:27:37,357 --> 00:27:40,152
Wait a minute.
How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?

299
00:27:40,402 --> 00:27:43,989
-Can't we see the unfertilised eggs?
-Shortly.

300
00:27:44,239 --> 00:27:47,993
<i>Now a whole team of genetic engineers
goes to work on....</i>

301
00:27:48,243 --> 00:27:51,455
-Can't you stop these things?
-I'm sorry. It's kind of a ride.

302
00:27:51,705 --> 00:27:55,209
One, two, three.

303
00:27:55,376 --> 00:27:56,751
You can't do that.

304
00:27:57,001 --> 00:28:00,588
-What?
-Can they do that?

305
00:28:01,589 --> 00:28:05,760
<i>A reminder: the boat for the mainland
will be leaving at 19:00.</i>

306
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:11,474
<i>All personnel be at the dock
no later than 18:45. No exceptions.</i>

307
00:28:11,725 --> 00:28:16,479
-G'day, Henry.
-Good day, sir.

308
00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:32,037
It's turning the eggs.

309
00:28:34,081 --> 00:28:38,043
Perfect timing. I'd hoped they'd hatch
before I had to go to the boat.

310
00:28:38,293 --> 00:28:40,712
Henry, why didn't you tell me?

311
00:28:40,963 --> 00:28:45,384
I insist on being here when they're born.

312
00:28:45,634 --> 00:28:49,554
Come on.

313
00:28:49,554 --> 00:28:54,058
Come on, little one.

314
00:29:02,275 --> 00:29:05,653
Very good. Push.

315
00:29:06,071 --> 00:29:08,073
-Very good.
-God.

316
00:29:08,323 --> 00:29:11,076
Push. Come on.

317
00:29:11,326 --> 00:29:14,287
Come on. Come on, then.

318
00:29:14,538 --> 00:29:18,917
There you are. There.

319
00:29:22,421 --> 00:29:26,842
They imprint on the first creature
they come in contact with.

320
00:29:27,092 --> 00:29:28,885
Helps them to trust me.

321
00:29:29,136 --> 00:29:35,267
I've been present for the birth
of every creature on this island.

322
00:29:35,517 --> 00:29:38,644
Surely not the ones
that have bred in the wild.

323
00:29:38,895 --> 00:29:40,980
Actually they can't breed in the wild.

324
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,900
Population control is one
of our security precautions.

325
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:48,112
There's no unauthorised breeding
in Jurassic Park.

326
00:29:48,363 --> 00:29:51,491
How do you know they can't breed?

327
00:29:51,741 --> 00:29:54,953
Because all the animals
in Jurassic Park are female.

328
00:29:55,203 --> 00:29:57,497
We've engineered them that way.

329
00:29:57,747 --> 00:30:00,834
There you are.

330
00:30:01,584 --> 00:30:04,504
Oh, my God. Look at that.

331
00:30:04,754 --> 00:30:08,049
Blood temperature seems like
about high 80s, maybe.

332
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:08,883
What?

333
00:30:09,134 --> 00:30:10,468
-91.
-91.

334
00:30:10,719 --> 00:30:12,804
Homeothermic? It holds that temperature?

335
00:30:13,054 --> 00:30:15,724
Yes.

336
00:30:18,769 --> 00:30:21,355
But, again, how do you know
they're all female?

337
00:30:21,605 --> 00:30:25,525
What, does somebody go out in the park
and pull up the dinosaurs' skirts?

338
00:30:25,776 --> 00:30:29,111
We control their chromosomes.
It's really not that difficult.

339
00:30:29,362 --> 00:30:31,614
All vertebrate embryos
are inherently female.

340
00:30:31,864 --> 00:30:35,535
They just require an extra hormone
given at the right developmental stage...

341
00:30:35,785 --> 00:30:36,744
...to make them male.

342
00:30:36,994 --> 00:30:39,747
-We simply deny them that.
-Deny them that?

343
00:30:39,997 --> 00:30:43,418
John, the kind of control
you're attempting is not possible.

344
00:30:43,668 --> 00:30:46,504
If there's one thing the history
of evolution has taught us...

345
00:30:46,754 --> 00:30:51,009
...it's that life will not be contained.
Life breaks free. Expands to new places...

346
00:30:51,259 --> 00:30:54,679
...and it crashes through barriers,
painfully, maybe even dangerously...

347
00:30:54,929 --> 00:30:59,184
...but there it is.

348
00:30:59,184 --> 00:31:00,685
There it is.

349
00:31:00,935 --> 00:31:05,982
You're implying that a group composed
entirely of female animals will breed.

350
00:31:06,233 --> 00:31:12,197
No, I'm simply saying that life finds a way.

351
00:31:17,828 --> 00:31:21,247
What species is this?

352
00:31:21,789 --> 00:31:24,959
It's a Velociraptor.

353
00:31:27,587 --> 00:31:30,631
You bred Raptors?

354
00:31:42,226 --> 00:31:47,315
Dr. Grant! As I was saying, we laid on
lunch for you before you go into the park.

355
00:31:47,565 --> 00:31:52,153
-Our gourmet chef, Alejandro--
-What are they doing?

356
00:31:56,908 --> 00:31:59,661
Feeding them.

357
00:32:03,164 --> 00:32:09,086
Alejandro's prepared a delightful menu
for us. Chilean sea bass.

358
00:32:09,336 --> 00:32:11,922
Shall we?

359
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,547
They should all be destroyed.

360
00:32:52,797 --> 00:32:53,757
Robert Muldoon.

361
00:32:54,007 --> 00:32:55,634
My game warden from Kenya.

362
00:32:55,884 --> 00:32:58,720
Bit of an alarmist, but knows more
about Raptors than anyone.

363
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,554
What's their growth rate?

364
00:33:00,804 --> 00:33:03,307
They're lethal at eight months,
and I do mean lethal.

365
00:33:03,557 --> 00:33:06,977
I've hunted most things that can hunt you,
but how these things move....

366
00:33:07,228 --> 00:33:09,063
-Fast for a biped?
-Cheetah speed.

367
00:33:09,313 --> 00:33:12,191
50, 60 miles per hour
if they ever got out in the open.

368
00:33:12,441 --> 00:33:14,068
And they're astonishing jumpers.

369
00:33:14,318 --> 00:33:18,739
Yes. That's why we're taking
extreme precautions.

370
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:21,242
Do they show intelligence?

371
00:33:21,492 --> 00:33:25,580
They show extreme intelligence.
Even problem-solving intelligence.

372
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,331
Especially the big one.

373
00:33:27,582 --> 00:33:29,709
We bred eight originally,
but when she came in...

374
00:33:29,959 --> 00:33:33,129
...she took over the pride
and killed all but two of the others.

375
00:33:33,379 --> 00:33:40,178
That one, when she looks at you,
you can see she's working things out.

376
00:33:40,428 --> 00:33:42,514
That's why we have to feed them like this.

377
00:33:42,764 --> 00:33:45,642
She had them all attacking the fences
when the feeders came.

378
00:33:45,892 --> 00:33:47,477
The fences are electrified, right?

379
00:33:47,727 --> 00:33:50,771
That's right, but they never attack
the same place twice.

380
00:33:51,021 --> 00:33:55,859
They were testing the fences
for weaknesses systematically.

381
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:59,154
They remember.

382
00:34:08,873 --> 00:34:11,876
Yes. Well, who's hungry?

383
00:34:12,126 --> 00:34:15,588
<i>More adventurous guests, of course,
can opt for our jungle river cruise...</i>

384
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:17,882
<i>...or for a close-up look at our majestic....</i>

385
00:34:18,132 --> 00:34:21,469
None of these attractions are ready yet,
but the park will open...

386
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:25,890
...with the basic tour you are about to take,
and then other rides will come on-line...

387
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:29,602
...six or twelve months after that.
Absolutely spectacular designs.

388
00:34:29,852 --> 00:34:32,981
-Spared no expense.
-And we can charge anything we want.

389
00:34:33,231 --> 00:34:35,775
$2,000 a day, $10,000 a day,
and people will pay it.

390
00:34:36,025 --> 00:34:39,154
-And there's the merchandise--
-Donald.

391
00:34:39,404 --> 00:34:42,489
This park was not built to cater
only for the super rich.

392
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:45,576
Everyone in the world has the right
to enjoy these animals.

393
00:34:45,826 --> 00:34:46,785
Sure. They will.

394
00:34:47,036 --> 00:34:52,041
We'll have a coupon day or something.

395
00:34:54,418 --> 00:35:00,716
The lack of humility before nature
that's being displayed here staggers me.

396
00:35:00,966 --> 00:35:04,303
I think things are a little different
than you and I had feared.

397
00:35:04,553 --> 00:35:05,971
I know. They're a lot worse.

398
00:35:06,222 --> 00:35:09,934
Now, wait a second,
we haven't even seen the park yet--

399
00:35:10,184 --> 00:35:14,313
Donald, let him talk. There's no reason,
I want to hear every viewpoint.

400
00:35:14,564 --> 00:35:19,068
Don't you see the danger, John,
inherent in what you're doing here?

401
00:35:19,318 --> 00:35:22,321
Genetic power's the most awesome force
the planet's ever seen...

402
00:35:22,572 --> 00:35:25,283
...but you wield it like a kid
that's found his dad's gun.

403
00:35:25,533 --> 00:35:28,953
-It's hardly appropriate to start hurling--
-If I may.

404
00:35:29,203 --> 00:35:32,706
I'll tell you the problem
with the scientific power you're using here.

405
00:35:32,956 --> 00:35:36,877
It didn't require any discipline to attain it.

406
00:35:37,127 --> 00:35:40,547
You read what others had done
and you took the next step.

407
00:35:40,798 --> 00:35:42,800
You didn't earn the knowledge
for yourselves...

408
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:46,220
...so you don't take
any responsibility for it.

409
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:50,474
You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to
accomplish something as fast as you could.

410
00:35:50,724 --> 00:35:54,645
Before you even knew what you had,
you patented it, and packaged it...

411
00:35:54,895 --> 00:36:00,234
...and slapped it on a plastic lunch box,
and now you're selling it.

412
00:36:00,484 --> 00:36:02,611
I don't think you're giving us
our due credit.

413
00:36:02,862 --> 00:36:06,115
Our scientists have done things
which nobody has ever done before.

414
00:36:06,365 --> 00:36:09,452
But your scientists were so preoccupied
with whether they could...

415
00:36:09,702 --> 00:36:11,787
...they didn't stop to think if they should.

416
00:36:12,038 --> 00:36:15,750
Condors.
Condors are on the verge of extinction.

417
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,381
If I created condors on this island,
you wouldn't have anything to say.

418
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:24,174
This isn't some species
that was obliterated...

419
00:36:24,424 --> 00:36:27,636
...by deforestation or the building of a dam.

420
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:34,393
Dinosaurs had their shot
and nature selected them for extinction.

421
00:36:34,601 --> 00:36:38,689
I don't understand this Luddite attitude.
Especially from a scientist.

422
00:36:38,939 --> 00:36:43,694
How can we stand in the light of discovery
and not act?

423
00:36:43,944 --> 00:36:47,448
What's so great about discovery?
It's a violent, penetrative act...

424
00:36:47,698 --> 00:36:52,119
...that scars what it explores.
What you call discovery...

425
00:36:52,369 --> 00:36:55,706
...I call the rape of the natural world.

426
00:36:55,956 --> 00:36:59,794
The question is, how can you know
anything about an extinct eco-system?

427
00:37:00,044 --> 00:37:02,880
How could you ever assume
that you can control it?

428
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:07,385
You have poisonous plants in this building.
You picked them because they look good.

429
00:37:07,635 --> 00:37:11,681
But these are aggressive living things
that have no idea what century they're in...

430
00:37:11,931 --> 00:37:16,476
...and they'll defend themselves.
Violently, if necessary.

431
00:37:17,352 --> 00:37:24,151
Dr. Grant. If there's one person who
could appreciate what I am trying to do....

432
00:37:24,192 --> 00:37:29,406
The world has just changed so radically
and we're all running to catch up.

433
00:37:29,656 --> 00:37:34,078
I don't want to jump to any conclusions,
but dinosaurs and man...

434
00:37:34,328 --> 00:37:38,332
...two species separated
by 65 million years of evolution...

435
00:37:38,582 --> 00:37:41,877
...have just been suddenly
thrown back into the mix together.

436
00:37:42,127 --> 00:37:47,383
How can we possibly have
the slightest idea what to expect?

437
00:37:47,633 --> 00:37:49,677
I don't believe it.

438
00:37:49,927 --> 00:37:53,055
You're meant to come here
and defend me against these characters...

439
00:37:53,305 --> 00:37:57,351
...and the only one I've got on my side
is the blood-sucking lawyer.

440
00:37:57,601 --> 00:38:00,313
Thank you.

441
00:38:05,817 --> 00:38:07,652
They're here.

442
00:38:07,903 --> 00:38:10,572
You four are gonna have a spot
of company out in the park.

443
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:13,450
Spend a little time
with our target audience.

444
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,868
Grandpa!

445
00:38:15,118 --> 00:38:17,829
Kids!

446
00:38:19,247 --> 00:38:23,126
-Wait! Careful with me.
-We missed you.

447
00:38:23,377 --> 00:38:26,922
-We loved the presents. They were great.
-Did you enjoy the helicopter?

448
00:38:27,172 --> 00:38:31,385
Yeah, it went down
and we all went right up.

449
00:38:33,137 --> 00:38:37,558
Now, kids, come away.
Not too close to the cars.

450
00:38:37,808 --> 00:38:40,686
Aren't they lovely?
Aren't they glorious, though.

451
00:38:40,936 --> 00:38:43,272
These will be your transports
for the afternoon.

452
00:38:43,522 --> 00:38:46,066
-No drivers?
-No, drivers. They're electric.

453
00:38:46,317 --> 00:38:49,195
They run on this track
in the middle of the roadway here.

454
00:38:49,445 --> 00:38:52,406
Totally non-polluting. Top of the line.
Spared no expense.

455
00:38:52,656 --> 00:38:55,075
It's an interactive CD-ROM!

456
00:38:55,325 --> 00:38:58,161
You touch the screen
and it talks about whatever you want.

457
00:38:58,411 --> 00:39:01,331
Lex, you're all right in there.
Dr. Sattler, come with me.

458
00:39:01,581 --> 00:39:03,333
Dr. Grant, come in the second car.

459
00:39:03,583 --> 00:39:07,712
I'm gonna ride with, Dr. Sattler.

460
00:39:17,723 --> 00:39:20,934
I read your book.

461
00:39:20,934 --> 00:39:22,895
That's great.

462
00:39:23,145 --> 00:39:28,025
Do you really think dinosaurs turned
into birds and that's where they went?

463
00:39:28,275 --> 00:39:32,696
A few species may have evolved
along those lines.

464
00:39:36,158 --> 00:39:39,620
They sure don't look like birds to me.

465
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:42,623
I heard that there was this meteor...

466
00:39:42,873 --> 00:39:46,918
...hit the earth someplace down in Mexico
and made this big crater.

467
00:39:47,168 --> 00:39:50,046
Listen...

468
00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:54,759
...Tim, which car were you planning on?

469
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:58,346
Whichever one you are.

470
00:39:59,472 --> 00:40:04,561
I heard about this thing in Omni
about this meteor making all this heat.

471
00:40:04,811 --> 00:40:07,147
It made diamond dust
and that changed the weather.

472
00:40:07,397 --> 00:40:08,857
They died because of the weather.

473
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:15,113
My teacher tells me about this book
by a guy named Bakker. He says--

474
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:19,159
She said I should ride with you
'cause it'd be good for you.

475
00:40:19,409 --> 00:40:20,953
<i>The boat is now loading.</i>

476
00:40:21,203 --> 00:40:27,042
<i>Everyone must be on the dock
for the 19:00 departure.</i>

477
00:40:27,292 --> 00:40:30,087
National Weather Service
is tracking a tropical storm...

478
00:40:30,337 --> 00:40:33,173
...about 75 miles west of us.

479
00:40:33,424 --> 00:40:35,049
Why didn't I build in Orlando?

480
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:40,597
I'll keep an eye on it.
Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.

481
00:40:43,433 --> 00:40:46,895
Start the tour program.

482
00:40:54,903 --> 00:40:58,323
Hold onto your butts.

483
00:41:06,456 --> 00:41:10,586
<i>And why did they put the fibreglass thing?</i>

484
00:41:19,928 --> 00:41:22,097
<i>You want to join the future, right?</i>

485
00:41:22,347 --> 00:41:24,475
<i>God help us when the hands of engineers--</i>

486
00:41:24,724 --> 00:41:27,435
<i>During your tour,
the appropriate information will be...</i>

487
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:30,188
<i>...automatically selected
and displayed for you.</i>

488
00:41:30,438 --> 00:41:33,942
<i>Simply touch the area of the screen
displaying the appropriate icon.</i>

489
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:35,318
Are we gonna hit that?

490
00:41:35,568 --> 00:41:39,197
<i>Welcome to Jurassic Park.</i>

491
00:41:41,783 --> 00:41:45,745
What have they got in there, King Kong?

492
00:41:57,758 --> 00:42:00,594
The voice you're now hearing
is Richard Kiley.

493
00:42:00,844 --> 00:42:01,928
We spared no expense.

494
00:42:02,179 --> 00:42:03,472
<i>If you look to the right...</i>

495
00:42:03,722 --> 00:42:09,228
<i>...you'll see a herd of the first dinosaurs
on our tour, called Dilophosaurus.</i>

496
00:42:09,478 --> 00:42:11,647
-Dilophosaurus!
-Shit!

497
00:42:11,897 --> 00:42:13,524
<i>One of the earliest carnivores...</i>

498
00:42:13,774 --> 00:42:16,692
<i>...we now know Dilophosaurus
is actually poisonous...</i>

499
00:42:16,943 --> 00:42:22,031
<i>...spitting its venom at its prey,
causing blindness and paralysis...</i>

500
00:42:22,281 --> 00:42:25,785
<i>...allowing the carnivore
to eat at its leisure.</i>

501
00:42:26,035 --> 00:42:29,664
<i>This makes Dilophosaurus a beautiful
but deadly addition...</i>

502
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:33,293
<i>...to Jurassic Park.</i>

503
00:42:38,882 --> 00:42:41,926
Alan?

504
00:42:46,514 --> 00:42:48,975
Damn.

505
00:42:52,437 --> 00:42:54,523
Vehicle headlights are on
and not responding.

506
00:42:54,773 --> 00:42:57,109
Those shouldn't be running off
of car batteries.

507
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:59,987
Item 151 on today's glitch list.

508
00:43:00,237 --> 00:43:02,990
We have all the problems
of a major theme park and a zoo...

509
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:07,785
...and the computers
aren't even on their feet yet.

510
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,499
Our lives are in your hands
and you have butter fingers?

511
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:15,960
I am totally unappreciated in my time.

512
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:19,881
You can run this park from this room
with minimal staff for up to three days.

513
00:43:20,131 --> 00:43:22,967
You think that kind of automation is easy?

514
00:43:23,217 --> 00:43:23,885
Or cheap?

515
00:43:24,135 --> 00:43:26,638
You know anyone
who can network eight machines...

516
00:43:26,888 --> 00:43:30,725
...and de-bug two million lines of code
on my salary? lf so, I want to see them.

517
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:35,230
Sorry about your financial problems,
I really am. But they are your problems.

518
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,774
You're absolutely right.
Everything's my problem.

519
00:43:38,024 --> 00:43:43,488
I will not be drawn into another
financial debate with you. I really will not.

520
00:43:43,738 --> 00:43:45,657
There's been hardly any debate at all.

521
00:43:45,907 --> 00:43:49,327
I don't blame people for their mistakes.

522
00:43:49,578 --> 00:43:51,788
But I do ask that they pay for them.

523
00:43:52,038 --> 00:43:54,249
Thanks, Dad.

524
00:43:54,499 --> 00:43:55,333
The headlights.

525
00:43:55,584 --> 00:43:58,085
I'll de-bug the tour program
when they get back, okay?

526
00:43:58,336 --> 00:44:01,422
It'll eat a lot of compute cycles.
We'll lose part of the system.

527
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:04,759
There's a small amount of memory,
you can't use it for everything.

528
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:09,680
-Are you gonna compile for a half an hour--
-Quiet, all of you!

529
00:44:09,764 --> 00:44:13,518
They're approaching
the Tyrannosaur paddock.

530
00:45:02,984 --> 00:45:06,737
God creates dinosaurs.
God destroys dinosaurs.

531
00:45:06,988 --> 00:45:12,660
God creates man. Man destroys God.
Man creates dinosaurs.

532
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:17,749
Dinosaurs eat man.

533
00:45:17,999 --> 00:45:21,628
Woman inherits the earth.

534
00:45:27,675 --> 00:45:32,430
<i>We'll try to tempt the Rex now.
Keep watching the fence.</i>

535
00:45:41,021 --> 00:45:44,442
What's going to happen to the goat?

536
00:45:47,236 --> 00:45:49,030
He's going to eat the goat?

537
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,490
Excellent.

538
00:45:51,741 --> 00:45:55,369
What's the matter, kid?
You never had lamb chops?

539
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:59,415
I happen to be a vegetarian.

540
00:46:06,214 --> 00:46:10,093
T. Rex doesn't want to be fed.
He wants to hunt.

541
00:46:10,343 --> 00:46:16,683
Can't just suppress 65 million years
of gut instinct.

542
00:46:37,286 --> 00:46:43,793
<i>Eventually you do plan to have dinosaurs
on your dinosaur tour, right?</i>

543
00:46:45,628 --> 00:46:48,297
<i>Hello. Yes?</i>

544
00:46:48,547 --> 00:46:52,093
I really hate that man.

545
00:46:55,763 --> 00:47:00,435
The Tyrannosaur doesn't obey
any set patterns or park schedules.

546
00:47:00,685 --> 00:47:03,771
The essence of chaos.

547
00:47:04,022 --> 00:47:07,525
I'm still not clear on chaos.

548
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:13,114
It simply deals with unpredictability
in complex systems.

549
00:47:13,114 --> 00:47:14,949
The shorthand is the Butterfly Effect.

550
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,243
A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking...

551
00:47:17,494 --> 00:47:21,872
...and in Central Park
you get rain instead of sunshine.

552
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:24,625
-Was I going too fast?
-I missed it.

553
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:25,709
I did a fly-by.

554
00:47:25,959 --> 00:47:28,545
Give me that glass of water.
We'll conduct an experiment.

555
00:47:28,796 --> 00:47:32,216
The car should be still. But that's okay.
It's just an example.

556
00:47:32,466 --> 00:47:35,469
Put your hand flat like a hieroglyphic.

557
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:37,346
A drop of water falls on your hand.

558
00:47:37,596 --> 00:47:40,391
Which way will the drop roll off?
Which finger?

559
00:47:40,641 --> 00:47:43,644
Thumb, I'd say.

560
00:47:44,812 --> 00:47:46,564
Freeze your hand. Don't move.

561
00:47:46,814 --> 00:47:49,692
I'll do the same thing,
start with the same place again.

562
00:47:49,942 --> 00:47:51,235
Which way, now?

563
00:47:51,485 --> 00:47:55,990
Let's say back the same way.

564
00:47:56,824 --> 00:47:59,118
It changed. Why?

565
00:47:59,368 --> 00:48:01,954
Because tiny variations...

566
00:48:02,205 --> 00:48:04,457
...the orientation of the hairs
on your hands...

567
00:48:04,707 --> 00:48:05,875
Alan, look at this.

568
00:48:06,125 --> 00:48:09,836
...the amount of blood distending
your vessels, imperfections in the skin...

569
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:12,339
<i>-Imperfections in the skin?
-Just microscopic.</i>

570
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:16,009
...never repeat and vastly effect
the outcome. That's...

571
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:19,847
-...what?
-Unpredictability.

572
00:48:21,056 --> 00:48:24,059
There. Look at this. See? I'm right again.

573
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:30,274
Nobody could predict that Dr. Grant
would jump out of a moving vehicle.

574
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:34,570
And there's another example.

575
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:40,409
See, here I am now by myself,
talking to myself. That's Chaos Theory.

576
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:43,829
Stop the program.

577
00:48:45,581 --> 00:48:49,293
I told you how many times we needed
locking mechanisms on the vehicle doors.

578
00:48:49,544 --> 00:48:52,505
<i>Stopping park vehicles
and rebooting program.</i>

579
00:48:52,755 --> 00:48:56,592
<i>We're on. Will notify for resume.</i>

580
00:48:57,468 --> 00:48:59,386
I'll switch it over to TelePrompTer.

581
00:48:59,636 --> 00:49:04,266
-What about the circuit integrities?
-Screen says faulty sensor.

582
00:49:05,601 --> 00:49:09,146
-I'll call security.
-We're at full go on that and it looks good.

583
00:49:09,396 --> 00:49:12,357
Like I said, there's this other book
by a guy named Bakker...

584
00:49:12,608 --> 00:49:14,735
...and he says dinosaurs died
from diseases.

585
00:49:14,985 --> 00:49:18,155
-Where are we going?
-He didn't say they turned into birds.

586
00:49:18,405 --> 00:49:20,366
Anyone else think
we shouldn't be out here?

587
00:49:20,616 --> 00:49:23,244
And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
Like this.

588
00:49:23,494 --> 00:49:27,498
-Really?
-Yours was fully illustrated.

589
00:49:27,748 --> 00:49:28,958
You okay?

590
00:49:29,208 --> 00:49:32,086
Look at this. Wait. Watch.

591
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:35,715
Come on. Watch this.

592
00:49:39,885 --> 00:49:42,972
Everybody stay here.

593
00:49:59,655 --> 00:50:03,408
-Okay?
-Of course.

594
00:50:04,785 --> 00:50:08,455
Don't be scared. Come on, it's okay.
Muldoon tranquillised her for me.

595
00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:11,542
She's sick.

596
00:50:18,882 --> 00:50:21,844
Oh, my God.

597
00:50:42,906 --> 00:50:45,200
She was always my favourite
when I was a kid...

598
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:50,372
...and now I see
she's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.

599
00:50:53,166 --> 00:50:56,086
It's okay.

600
00:50:57,671 --> 00:51:01,800
Microvesicles. That's interesting.

601
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:04,887
Thanks. What are her symptoms?

602
00:51:05,137 --> 00:51:07,806
Imbalance, disorientation,
laboured breathing.

603
00:51:08,057 --> 00:51:10,059
It seems to happen every six weeks or so.

604
00:51:10,309 --> 00:51:13,228
Six weeks.

605
00:51:25,324 --> 00:51:26,784
-These are dilated.
-They are?

606
00:51:27,034 --> 00:51:30,287
-Take a look.
-I'll be damned.

607
00:51:30,538 --> 00:51:35,834
That's pharmacological.
From local plant life.

608
00:51:41,715 --> 00:51:44,050
Is this West lndian lilac?

609
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:49,389
Yes. We know they're toxic,
but the animals don't eat them.

610
00:51:52,267 --> 00:51:56,355
-Are you sure?
-Pretty sure.

611
00:51:56,605 --> 00:51:59,274
There's only one way to be positive.

612
00:51:59,525 --> 00:52:02,986
I'd have to see the dinosaur's droppings.

613
00:52:03,237 --> 00:52:07,908
Dino droppings? Droppings?

614
00:52:12,162 --> 00:52:15,207
Yeah, I got that.

615
00:52:15,457 --> 00:52:18,627
That storm centre hasn't dissipated
or changed course.

616
00:52:18,878 --> 00:52:21,172
We're gonna have to cut the tour short.

617
00:52:21,421 --> 00:52:23,047
We'll pick it up again tomorrow.

618
00:52:23,298 --> 00:52:26,384
-Are you sure we have to?
-It's not worth taking the chance.

619
00:52:26,634 --> 00:52:30,096
-Sustained winds at 45 knots.
-Tell them when they get back in the cars.

620
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:34,851
Ladies and gentlemen last shuttle leaving
for the dock leaves in five minutes.

621
00:52:35,101 --> 00:52:38,980
Drop what you're doing and leave now.

622
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:42,651
Damn.

623
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:51,994
That is one big pile of shit.

624
00:52:57,791 --> 00:53:00,252
You're right.
There's no trace of lilac berries.

625
00:53:00,502 --> 00:53:02,755
That's so odd, though.

626
00:53:03,005 --> 00:53:07,843
All right,
she's suffering from Melia toxicity...

627
00:53:08,344 --> 00:53:12,180
...every six weeks.

628
00:53:12,263 --> 00:53:16,518
Let's see, rats.

629
00:53:16,768 --> 00:53:20,605
She's tenacious.

630
00:53:20,855 --> 00:53:24,109
You have no idea.

631
00:53:24,651 --> 00:53:30,115
You will remember to wash your hands
before you eat anything?

632
00:53:40,792 --> 00:53:46,256
Doctors, if you please,
I have to insist that we get moving.

633
00:53:47,132 --> 00:53:51,220
I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding
and finish up with the Trike.

634
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:53,096
Sure. I'm in a gas-powered jeep.

635
00:53:53,347 --> 00:53:55,933
I'll drop her off at the centre
before I make the boat.

636
00:53:56,183 --> 00:53:58,852
Great. Then I'll catch up with you later.

637
00:53:59,103 --> 00:53:59,895
You sure?

638
00:54:00,145 --> 00:54:02,772
Yeah, I want to stay
with her a little longer.

639
00:54:03,022 --> 00:54:05,984
Okay, then.

640
00:54:19,247 --> 00:54:23,376
<i>There's nothing I can do.
The captain says we have to go, we go.</i>

641
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:25,170
You've got to give me time.

642
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:28,924
I did a test run, it took me 20 minutes.
I think I can push it to 18 but...

643
00:54:29,174 --> 00:54:31,134
...you've got to give me
at least 15 minutes.

644
00:54:31,384 --> 00:54:34,262
<i>No promises.</i>

645
00:54:40,477 --> 00:54:44,606
Visitor vehicles are returning
to the garage.

646
00:54:45,399 --> 00:54:51,572
So much for our first tour.
Two no-shows and one sick Triceratops.

647
00:54:51,822 --> 00:54:54,490
It could've been worse.

648
00:54:54,741 --> 00:54:55,908
A lot worse.

649
00:54:56,159 --> 00:55:00,079
Anybody want a soda or something?
I'm going up to the machine.

650
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,332
I thought maybe
I'd get somebody something.

651
00:55:02,582 --> 00:55:06,920
I've had only sweets
and I'm gonna get something salty.

652
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:10,465
I finished de-bugging the phones.

653
00:55:10,715 --> 00:55:12,759
I was going to, so I did.

654
00:55:13,009 --> 00:55:15,887
So I de-bugged the phones.
And I thought maybe...

655
00:55:16,137 --> 00:55:18,723
...I should tell you the system
will be compiling...

656
00:55:18,974 --> 00:55:21,685
...for 18 to 20 minutes,
so some of the minor systems...

657
00:55:21,935 --> 00:55:27,107
...they might go on and off for a while,
but it's nothing to worry about.

658
00:55:47,877 --> 00:55:53,674
-Do you have any kids?
-Me? Hell, yeah. Three. I love kids.

659
00:55:54,092 --> 00:55:56,719
Anything at all can and does happen.

660
00:55:56,970 --> 00:55:59,639
Same with wives, for that matter.

661
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:03,893
-You're married?
-Occasionally.

662
00:56:04,394 --> 00:56:10,316
I'm always on the lookout
for a future ex-Mrs. Malcolm.

663
00:56:22,329 --> 00:56:26,291
Five, four....

664
00:56:36,926 --> 00:56:39,220
-That's odd.
-What?

665
00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:41,722
Door security systems are shutting down.

666
00:56:41,973 --> 00:56:46,727
Nedry said a few systems
would go off-line, didn't he?

667
00:57:41,324 --> 00:57:44,076
By the way, Dr. Sattler...

668
00:57:44,327 --> 00:57:49,290
-...she's not, like, available, is she?
-Why?

669
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:55,004
-I'm sorry. You two are....
-Yeah.

670
00:57:56,839 --> 00:58:02,137
-What'd I touch?
-You didn't touch anything. We stopped.

671
00:58:09,477 --> 00:58:11,021
What the hell?

672
00:58:11,271 --> 00:58:14,441
-What now?
-Fences are failing all over the park.

673
00:58:14,691 --> 00:58:18,402
Find Nedry. Check the vending machines.

674
00:58:48,766 --> 00:58:50,685
Just look at this work station.

675
00:58:50,935 --> 00:58:55,982
-What a complete slob.
-The Raptor fences aren't out, are they?

676
00:59:01,446 --> 00:59:04,741
No, no. They're still on.

677
00:59:05,824 --> 00:59:09,912
Why the hell would he turn
the other ones off?

678
00:59:48,451 --> 00:59:50,703
Access main program.

679
00:59:50,954 --> 00:59:53,122
Access main security.

680
00:59:53,373 --> 00:59:56,625
Access main program grid.

681
01:00:04,216 --> 01:00:06,468
<i>You didn't say the magic word.</i>

682
01:00:06,719 --> 01:00:10,139
Please! Goddamn it.
I hate this hacker crap.

683
01:00:10,389 --> 01:00:15,186
Phone Nedry's people in Cambridge.

684
01:00:16,061 --> 01:00:19,148
Phones are out, too.

685
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:24,362
Where did the vehicles stop?

686
01:00:43,998 --> 01:00:45,785
Their radio's out, too.

687
01:00:46,035 --> 01:00:48,196
-Gennaro said to stay put.
-Kids okay?

688
01:00:48,446 --> 01:00:50,441
I didn't ask. Why wouldn't they be?

689
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:52,227
-Kids get scared.
-What's scary?

690
01:00:52,477 --> 01:00:55,428
-It's just a little hiccup in the power.
-I'm not scared.

691
01:00:55,677 --> 01:00:59,252
-I didn't say you were scared.
-I know.

692
01:01:01,330 --> 01:01:03,616
Hey, where did you find those?

693
01:01:03,866 --> 01:01:06,692
-In the box, under my seat.
-Are they heavy?

694
01:01:06,942 --> 01:01:11,139
-Yeah.
-Then they're expensive. Put them back.

695
01:01:16,751 --> 01:01:19,868
Don't scare me.

696
01:01:29,843 --> 01:01:33,168
Cool. Night vision.

697
01:01:56,831 --> 01:01:59,833
Did you feel that?

698
01:02:32,242 --> 01:02:36,413
Maybe it's the power
trying to come back on.

699
01:02:37,497 --> 01:02:40,333
What is that?

700
01:02:55,932 --> 01:02:58,851
Where's the goat?

701
01:03:20,373 --> 01:03:23,126
Jesus!

702
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:29,799
He left us.

703
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:45,441
-Where does he think he's going?
-When you gotta go, you gotta go.

704
01:04:01,999 --> 01:04:04,835
Dr. Grant.

705
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:19,851
I hate being right all the time.

706
01:04:27,775 --> 01:04:33,488
Keep absolutely still.
Its vision is based on movement.

707
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:49,047
Turn the light off.

708
01:04:52,425 --> 01:04:55,428
Turn the light off!

709
01:05:49,733 --> 01:05:54,153
-Hurry! Turn it off!
-I'm sorry!

710
01:05:56,782 --> 01:06:00,328
You're the one who turned it--

711
01:07:17,779 --> 01:07:19,365
Ian, freeze!

712
01:07:19,615 --> 01:07:21,742
Get the kids!

713
01:07:21,993 --> 01:07:25,078
-Get rid of the flare!
-Get the kids!

714
01:07:25,329 --> 01:07:28,458
Get rid of the flare!

715
01:07:29,876 --> 01:07:33,254
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord be--

716
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:56,945
Dr. Grant!

717
01:08:00,031 --> 01:08:02,450
I'm stuck. The seat's got my feet.

718
01:08:02,699 --> 01:08:06,121
I'll get you next. You're okay.

719
01:08:06,371 --> 01:08:08,248
You're all right.

720
01:08:08,499 --> 01:08:11,626
Tim. Tim!

721
01:08:13,795 --> 01:08:18,257
Don't move.
He can't see us if we don't move.

722
01:09:22,114 --> 01:09:25,744
Lex! Lex, you're choking me.

723
01:09:27,036 --> 01:09:29,829
Grab the wire.

724
01:09:48,015 --> 01:09:51,768
<i>Keycheck space minus 0.
Keychecks off, safety space minus 0.</i>

725
01:09:52,019 --> 01:09:55,063
He's turning the safety systems off.
Doesn't want anybody to see.

726
01:09:55,314 --> 01:09:58,442
Look at this next entry.
It's the kicker. "White rabbit object."

727
01:09:58,692 --> 01:10:02,488
It did it all. With the keychecks off,
the computer didn't file the keystrokes.

728
01:10:02,738 --> 01:10:06,324
The way to find them is to check
the computer's lines of code one by one.

729
01:10:06,574 --> 01:10:09,745
-How many lines of code are there?
-About two million.

730
01:10:09,994 --> 01:10:12,957
-Two million?
-Yeah.

731
01:10:14,375 --> 01:10:20,631
Robert, I wonder if perhaps you would
be good enough to take a gas jeep...

732
01:10:20,673 --> 01:10:23,550
...and bring back my grandchildren.

733
01:10:23,801 --> 01:10:26,387
Sure.

734
01:10:27,764 --> 01:10:30,809
I'm going with him.

735
01:10:32,602 --> 01:10:35,187
John.

736
01:10:39,609 --> 01:10:44,655
I can't get Jurassic Park back on-line
without Dennis Nedry.

737
01:11:03,257 --> 01:11:05,969
Damn it!

738
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:14,101
There's the road!

739
01:11:19,106 --> 01:11:22,986
Winch this sucker off the thing
and then I tie it to the that thing there.

740
01:11:23,236 --> 01:11:28,200
I'll pull down this thing here,
and pull it back up again.

741
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:39,961
My glasses. I can afford more glasses!

742
01:12:07,614 --> 01:12:12,495
You've got time. You can do it.
Do it. Come on, Dennis.

743
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:20,961
Hello.

744
01:12:24,548 --> 01:12:28,885
Yeah, that's nice. I've got to go.

745
01:12:38,562 --> 01:12:40,063
Nice boy.

746
01:12:40,313 --> 01:12:41,732
Nice boy.

747
01:12:41,982 --> 01:12:44,193
Nice dinosaur.

748
01:12:44,444 --> 01:12:47,696
Thought you were one of your big brothers.
You're not so bad.

749
01:12:47,946 --> 01:12:51,699
What do you want? A little food?
Look at me. I just fell down a hill.

750
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:56,580
I'm soaking wet. I don't have any food.
I have nothing on me.

751
01:12:56,831 --> 01:13:00,584
Go on. Play fetch?

752
01:13:01,209 --> 01:13:03,962
Look, stick.

753
01:13:04,087 --> 01:13:06,674
Look at stick.

754
01:13:06,924 --> 01:13:10,344
Stick, stupid.
Fetch the stick, boy. Look at the stick.

755
01:13:10,594 --> 01:13:12,847
You like the stick? Go on and get it.

756
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:15,933
No wonder you're extinct.

757
01:13:16,183 --> 01:13:19,979
I'm gonna run you over
when I come back down.

758
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:38,015
Timmy!

759
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:43,063
Now, Lex. Listen.

760
01:14:43,313 --> 01:14:45,399
Lex, I'm right here.

761
01:14:45,649 --> 01:14:47,984
I'll look after you.
I have to help your brother.

762
01:14:48,234 --> 01:14:50,572
Stay right here and wait for me.

763
01:14:50,822 --> 01:14:53,407
He left us.

764
01:14:53,657 --> 01:14:57,703
But that's not what I'm going to do.

765
01:14:58,203 --> 01:15:00,790
Okay?

766
01:15:01,832 --> 01:15:04,500
Stay here.

767
01:15:30,193 --> 01:15:32,571
You hear me? I'm coming up.

768
01:15:32,821 --> 01:15:38,326
I hate climbing. I hate trees, way too high.

769
01:16:05,062 --> 01:16:07,690
You okay?

770
01:16:09,150 --> 01:16:11,944
I threw up.

771
01:16:13,529 --> 01:16:15,447
That's okay.

772
01:16:15,698 --> 01:16:18,951
Just give me your hand.

773
01:16:21,579 --> 01:16:27,168
Tim, I won't tell anyone you threw up.
Just give me your hand.

774
01:16:34,676 --> 01:16:37,553
Here, I've got you.

775
01:16:37,803 --> 01:16:39,139
Okay.

776
01:16:39,389 --> 01:16:44,768
-That's good. Over the rail.
-Don't pull me too hard.

777
01:16:47,771 --> 01:16:51,567
Stand on the door. Hang on to me.

778
01:16:53,652 --> 01:16:56,197
-That's not too bad, right, Timmy?
-Yes, it is.

779
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:58,992
It's like a tree house.
Your dad ever build you one?

780
01:16:59,242 --> 01:17:02,328
-No.
-Yeah, me, too.

781
01:17:02,453 --> 01:17:05,080
The thing about climbing is,
you never look down.

782
01:17:05,330 --> 01:17:06,958
This is impossible.

783
01:17:07,209 --> 01:17:13,006
-How am I going to do this? It's about--
-I'm going to help you with your footing.

784
01:17:17,219 --> 01:17:19,804
Tim, go.

785
01:17:40,867 --> 01:17:43,871
Go, Tim, go!

786
01:17:50,627 --> 01:17:53,380
Faster, Tim!

787
01:17:58,552 --> 01:18:01,221
Tim, jump!

788
01:18:03,681 --> 01:18:06,309
Go, Tim.

789
01:18:13,233 --> 01:18:17,195
We're back in the car again.

790
01:18:17,863 --> 01:18:21,492
At least you're out of the tree.

791
01:18:25,328 --> 01:18:28,498
Where's the other car?

792
01:18:30,209 --> 01:18:32,251
Alan!

793
01:18:32,501 --> 01:18:35,297
Dr. Grant!

794
01:18:49,895 --> 01:18:54,859
-I think this was Gennaro.
-I think this was, too.

795
01:18:56,904 --> 01:18:59,279
-I think it's ahead of us.
-It could be anywhere.

796
01:18:59,530 --> 01:19:04,451
With fences down,
it can wander in and out of any paddock.

797
01:19:09,915 --> 01:19:13,462
He's put a tourniquet on. Ian.

798
01:19:13,628 --> 01:19:17,882
Remind me to thank John
for a lovely weekend.

799
01:19:21,344 --> 01:19:24,179
Can we chance moving him?

800
01:19:24,430 --> 01:19:27,432
Please chance it.

801
01:19:34,439 --> 01:19:37,567
Ellie, come on!

802
01:19:43,575 --> 01:19:45,159
The other car!

803
01:19:45,409 --> 01:19:48,203
Dr. Grant?

804
01:19:51,165 --> 01:19:54,209
They're not here.

805
01:20:22,030 --> 01:20:25,075
Anybody hear that?

806
01:20:27,119 --> 01:20:30,163
It's an impact tremor, is what it is.

807
01:20:30,413 --> 01:20:33,417
I'm fairly alarmed here.

808
01:20:33,667 --> 01:20:37,880
Come on. We've got to get out of here.
Now!

809
01:20:38,172 --> 01:20:40,799
Let's go.

810
01:20:50,725 --> 01:20:53,562
Must go faster.

811
01:20:54,688 --> 01:20:59,067
Here it comes! Stand on it! Fifth gear!

812
01:21:03,864 --> 01:21:08,535
-Get off the stick! Bloody move!
-Look out!

813
01:21:34,103 --> 01:21:37,982
Think they'll have that on the tour?

814
01:21:44,613 --> 01:21:47,742
Are you hearing this?

815
01:21:52,788 --> 01:21:55,666
Come on, Tim. Hurry up.

816
01:21:55,917 --> 01:21:59,170
Let's get up this tree.

817
01:22:00,588 --> 01:22:04,884
Come on, Tim, it's okay.
Listen. Try up here.

818
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:09,430
I hate trees.

819
01:22:09,682 --> 01:22:14,851
-They don't bother me.
-Yeah? Well, you weren't in the last one.

820
01:22:27,823 --> 01:22:32,912
Look at the Brontosauruses.
I mean, Brachiosaurus.

821
01:22:32,912 --> 01:22:35,873
They're singing.

822
01:23:03,568 --> 01:23:05,236
Don't let the monsters come here.

823
01:23:05,486 --> 01:23:08,907
They're not monsters, they're animals.
These are herbivores.

824
01:23:09,157 --> 01:23:12,368
They only eat vegetables.
For you, I think they'd make an exception.

825
01:23:12,619 --> 01:23:15,830
I hate the other kind.

826
01:23:16,372 --> 01:23:20,711
The other kind just do what they do.

827
01:23:39,270 --> 01:23:42,023
What's that?

828
01:23:45,693 --> 01:23:51,032
What are you and Ellie going to do,
if you don't dig up bones anymore?

829
01:23:51,073 --> 01:23:53,326
I don't know.

830
01:23:53,576 --> 01:23:57,539
I guess we'll just have to evolve, too.

831
01:23:59,666 --> 01:24:03,421
What do you call a blind dinosaur?

832
01:24:03,878 --> 01:24:08,842
<i>-What do you call a blind dinosaur?
-Do-you-think-he-saurus.</i>

833
01:24:11,596 --> 01:24:14,681
What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?

834
01:24:14,932 --> 01:24:16,183
You got me.

835
01:24:16,433 --> 01:24:19,978
A "Do-you-think-he-saurus' Rex."

836
01:24:21,147 --> 01:24:23,732
-Alan?
-Yeah?

837
01:24:23,983 --> 01:24:28,695
What if the dinosaurs come back
while we're all asleep?

838
01:24:29,446 --> 01:24:33,200
-I'll stay awake.
-All night?

839
01:24:34,243 --> 01:24:36,912
All night.

840
01:25:25,628 --> 01:25:28,798
They were all melting.

841
01:25:30,966 --> 01:25:35,638
Malcolm's okay for now.
I gave him a shot of morphine.

842
01:25:37,974 --> 01:25:40,267
They'll all be fine.

843
01:25:40,517 --> 01:25:46,356
Who better to get the children through
Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?

844
01:25:49,276 --> 01:25:52,072
You know, the first...

845
01:25:52,322 --> 01:25:57,327
...attraction I ever built
when I came down from Scotland...

846
01:25:57,451 --> 01:26:01,080
...was a flea circus, Petticoat Lane.

847
01:26:01,332 --> 01:26:03,458
Really quite wonderful.

848
01:26:03,708 --> 01:26:08,505
I had a wee trapeze and a...

849
01:26:10,174 --> 01:26:12,926
...carousel...

850
01:26:15,303 --> 01:26:17,596
...and a seesaw.

851
01:26:17,847 --> 01:26:20,142
They all move motorised, of course.

852
01:26:20,392 --> 01:26:22,935
People said they saw the fleas.
I can see the fleas.

853
01:26:23,185 --> 01:26:25,438
<i>Can't you see the fleas?</i>

854
01:26:25,688 --> 01:26:31,527
Clown fleas, high-wire fleas,
and fleas on parade.

855
01:26:36,198 --> 01:26:39,119
With this place...

856
01:26:39,786 --> 01:26:43,915
...I wanted to show them something
that wasn't an illusion.

857
01:26:44,166 --> 01:26:48,836
Something that was real.
Something that they could...

858
01:26:50,421 --> 01:26:53,423
...see and touch.

859
01:26:56,636 --> 01:27:00,599
An aim not devoid of merit.

860
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:08,732
But you can't think through this one, John.
You have to feel it.

861
01:27:09,398 --> 01:27:12,696
You're absolutely right.

862
01:27:12,945 --> 01:27:15,114
Hiring Nedry was a mistake,
that's obvious.

863
01:27:15,364 --> 01:27:17,908
We're overdependent on automation,
I can see that now.

864
01:27:18,158 --> 01:27:21,326
Next time, everything's correctable.

865
01:27:21,578 --> 01:27:26,332
Creation is an act of sheer will.

866
01:27:27,126 --> 01:27:29,419
Next time, it'll be flawless.

867
01:27:29,669 --> 01:27:32,881
It's still the flea circus. It's all an illusion.

868
01:27:33,132 --> 01:27:34,466
When we have control--

869
01:27:34,716 --> 01:27:37,302
You've never had control!
That's the illusion.

870
01:27:37,553 --> 01:27:41,390
I was overwhelmed
by the power of this place.

871
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:42,933
I made a mistake, too.

872
01:27:43,184 --> 01:27:48,522
I didn't have enough respect
for that power, and it's out now.

873
01:27:49,606 --> 01:27:54,319
The only thing that matters now
are the people we love.

874
01:27:54,943 --> 01:27:58,615
Alan, Lex, and Tim.

875
01:27:58,698 --> 01:28:03,370
John, they're out there,
where people are dying.

876
01:28:18,886 --> 01:28:21,555
It's good.

877
01:28:23,974 --> 01:28:26,978
Spared no expense.

878
01:28:52,797 --> 01:28:56,383
-Go away!
-It's okay. It's a Brachiosaurus.

879
01:28:56,632 --> 01:28:59,595
It's a "Veggie-saurus", Lex.
"Veggie-saurus."

880
01:28:59,844 --> 01:29:01,721
Veggie.

881
01:29:01,971 --> 01:29:05,308
Come on. Come on, girl.

882
01:29:07,978 --> 01:29:10,897
Come on, baby.

883
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:18,820
I'm not letting go.

884
01:29:29,208 --> 01:29:32,168
-It looks like it has a cold.
-Yeah. Maybe.

885
01:29:32,419 --> 01:29:34,128
-Can I touch it?
-Sure.

886
01:29:34,378 --> 01:29:38,966
Just think of it as kind of a big cow.

887
01:29:40,801 --> 01:29:43,554
I like cows.

888
01:29:52,063 --> 01:29:55,943
Come on, girl. Come on up here, girl.

889
01:30:01,865 --> 01:30:04,660
God bless you.

890
01:30:09,498 --> 01:30:12,708
Great. Now she'll never try anything new.

891
01:30:12,959 --> 01:30:15,838
She'll sit in her room, never come out,
play on her computer.

892
01:30:16,088 --> 01:30:18,715
-I'm a hacker.
-That's what I said. You're a nerd.

893
01:30:18,965 --> 01:30:22,176
I am not a computer nerd.
I prefer to be called a hacker.

894
01:30:22,427 --> 01:30:25,098
God.

895
01:30:28,518 --> 01:30:31,688
You know what this is?

896
01:30:32,063 --> 01:30:34,523
It's a dinosaur egg.

897
01:30:34,774 --> 01:30:39,527
The dinosaurs are breeding.

898
01:30:41,155 --> 01:30:46,367
But my grandpa said
all the dinosaurs were girls.

899
01:30:46,618 --> 01:30:50,413
-Amphibian DNA.
-What's that?

900
01:30:52,749 --> 01:30:57,629
The film said they used frog DNA
to fill in the gene-sequence gaps.

901
01:30:57,879 --> 01:31:01,968
They mutated the dinosaur genetic code.

902
01:31:02,217 --> 01:31:06,013
And blended it with that of frogs.

903
01:31:07,389 --> 01:31:11,686
Some West African frogs have been known
to change sex from male to female...

904
01:31:11,937 --> 01:31:15,521
...in a single sex environment.

905
01:31:15,981 --> 01:31:18,693
Malcolm was right.

906
01:31:18,942 --> 01:31:21,529
Look.

907
01:31:28,745 --> 01:31:31,997
Life found a way.

908
01:31:33,792 --> 01:31:37,796
That's crazy. You're out of your mind.
He's absolutely out of his mind.

909
01:31:38,046 --> 01:31:40,090
Wait. What exactly would this mean?

910
01:31:40,340 --> 01:31:44,052
We're talking about a calculated risk,
which is the only option left to us.

911
01:31:44,303 --> 01:31:49,014
We'll never find the command Nedry used.
He's covered his tracks far too well.

912
01:31:49,264 --> 01:31:51,934
I think it's obvious now
that he's not coming back.

913
01:31:52,185 --> 01:31:56,564
-So, shutting down the entire system--
-Get somebody else. I won't do it.

914
01:31:56,814 --> 01:32:02,862
Shutting down the system is the only way
to wipe out everything he did.

915
01:32:03,112 --> 01:32:06,615
Now, as I understand it,
all the systems will then come back...

916
01:32:06,866 --> 01:32:09,869
...on their original start-up mode. Correct?

917
01:32:10,119 --> 01:32:12,956
Theoretically, yes.
We've never shut down before.

918
01:32:13,206 --> 01:32:16,041
-It may not come back on.
-Would we get the phones back?

919
01:32:16,293 --> 01:32:18,294
Yes, again, in theory.

920
01:32:18,544 --> 01:32:21,798
What about the lysine contingency?
We could put that into effect.

921
01:32:22,048 --> 01:32:24,717
-What's that?
-That's absolutely out of the question.

922
01:32:24,967 --> 01:32:27,636
The lysine contingency
prevents the spread of animals...

923
01:32:27,886 --> 01:32:29,598
...if they ever get off the island.

924
01:32:29,848 --> 01:32:33,351
Wu inserted a gene that creates
a faulty enzyme in protein metabolism.

925
01:32:33,601 --> 01:32:36,354
The animals can't manufacture
the amino acid, lysine.

926
01:32:36,604 --> 01:32:40,191
Unless they're supplied with lysine by us,
they slip into a coma and die.

927
01:32:40,443 --> 01:32:44,446
People are dying.

928
01:32:47,116 --> 01:32:51,036
Will you please shut down the system?

929
01:33:11,515 --> 01:33:14,727
Hold on to your butts.

930
01:33:33,078 --> 01:33:34,079
It's okay.

931
01:33:34,330 --> 01:33:38,541
Look, see that? It's on. It worked.

932
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:41,711
What do you mean it worked?
Everything's off.

933
01:33:41,963 --> 01:33:45,924
Shutdown tripped the circuit breakers.
Turn them back on, reboot a few systems:

934
01:33:46,174 --> 01:33:49,386
Telephones, security doors,
half dozen others, but it worked.

935
01:33:49,635 --> 01:33:51,889
-System's ready.
-Where are the breakers?

936
01:33:52,139 --> 01:33:53,682
The shed at end of the compound.

937
01:33:53,932 --> 01:33:56,518
Three minutes, I'll have the power back on
in the park.

938
01:33:56,769 --> 01:33:59,688
Just to be safe, I want everybody
in the emergency bunker...

939
01:33:59,939 --> 01:34:03,316
...until Mr. Arnold returns,
and the whole system's running again.

940
01:34:03,567 --> 01:34:06,444
-I'm tired. I'm hot.
-I'm dirty.

941
01:34:06,695 --> 01:34:10,867
Looking at the map,
I'd say the visitor's centre is just a mile...

942
01:34:11,117 --> 01:34:14,370
...over that rise there.

943
01:34:17,289 --> 01:34:19,876
What is that?

944
01:34:21,086 --> 01:34:24,839
Tim, can you tell me what they are?

945
01:34:30,345 --> 01:34:31,428
Gallimimus.

946
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:35,725
Are those meat-eating?

947
01:34:35,808 --> 01:34:38,644
"Meat-asauruses"?

948
01:34:42,106 --> 01:34:44,399
Look at the wheeling.
Uniform direction changes.

949
01:34:44,649 --> 01:34:48,612
Just like a flock of birds
evading a predator.

950
01:34:48,862 --> 01:34:53,533
They're flocking this way.

951
01:35:34,951 --> 01:35:36,994
-I want to go now.
-Just look how it eats.

952
01:35:37,246 --> 01:35:38,370
Please.

953
01:35:38,622 --> 01:35:41,209
I bet you'll never look at birds
the same way again.

954
01:35:41,459 --> 01:35:45,085
-Yes.
-Go now.

955
01:35:45,378 --> 01:35:49,592
Okay. Keep low and follow me.

956
01:35:50,466 --> 01:35:53,803
Look how much blood.

957
01:35:54,470 --> 01:35:57,224
God. Something went wrong.

958
01:35:57,475 --> 01:36:02,563
Something's happened.
Something's wrong.

959
01:36:03,730 --> 01:36:05,148
This is just a delay.

960
01:36:05,399 --> 01:36:08,485
That's all it is.
All major theme parks have delays.

961
01:36:08,735 --> 01:36:13,239
When they opened Disneyland in 1956,
nothing worked.

962
01:36:13,490 --> 01:36:17,034
If the Pirates of the Caribbean
breaks down, the pirates don't eat tourists.

963
01:36:17,285 --> 01:36:22,206
I can't wait any more. Something's wrong.
I'm gonna go get the power back on.

964
01:36:22,456 --> 01:36:25,460
You can't just stroll down the road,
you know.

965
01:36:25,711 --> 01:36:30,548
Don't let's be too hasty.
I mean, he's only been gone....

966
01:36:31,675 --> 01:36:35,262
-I'm going with you.
-Okay.

967
01:36:49,359 --> 01:36:51,945
Sorry.

968
01:36:54,406 --> 01:36:58,535
Now, this isn't going to be just like
switching on the kitchen light.

969
01:36:58,784 --> 01:37:03,707
But I think I can follow this
and then talk you through it.

970
01:37:06,752 --> 01:37:09,296
Right.

971
01:37:13,801 --> 01:37:15,678
It ought to be me, really, going.

972
01:37:15,928 --> 01:37:20,017
-Why?
-I'm a.... And you're a....

973
01:37:20,268 --> 01:37:22,435
-Look.
-Come on, let's go.

974
01:37:22,685 --> 01:37:25,771
We can discuss sexism
in survival situations when I get back.

975
01:37:26,021 --> 01:37:31,194
You just take me through this step by step.
I'm on Channel 2.

976
01:38:06,646 --> 01:38:09,774
The shutdown must've turned off
all the fences.

977
01:38:10,024 --> 01:38:15,239
Damn it, even Nedry knew better
than to mess with the Raptor pen.

978
01:38:19,659 --> 01:38:22,371
Come on, this way.

979
01:38:28,335 --> 01:38:30,253
I can see the shed from here.

980
01:38:30,503 --> 01:38:32,339
We can make it if we run.

981
01:38:32,589 --> 01:38:35,800
No. We can't.

982
01:38:36,050 --> 01:38:37,593
Why not?

983
01:38:37,843 --> 01:38:40,889
Because we're being hunted.

984
01:38:41,139 --> 01:38:44,685
In the bushes, straight ahead.

985
01:38:45,768 --> 01:38:47,396
It's all right.

986
01:38:47,646 --> 01:38:50,108
Like hell it is.

987
01:38:50,358 --> 01:38:55,069
Run. Towards the shed.

988
01:38:55,737 --> 01:38:57,905
I've got her.

989
01:38:58,156 --> 01:39:01,201
Go. Now!

990
01:39:18,844 --> 01:39:21,763
Mr. Arnold?

991
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:27,144
John, I'm in.

992
01:39:27,394 --> 01:39:29,896
<i>Great.</i>

993
01:39:29,896 --> 01:39:34,193
Ahead of you is a metal staircase.
Go down it.

994
01:39:34,443 --> 01:39:37,404
<i>Okay. Going down.</i>

995
01:39:37,654 --> 01:39:41,407
After 20 or 30 feet
you come to a T-junction. Take a left.

996
01:39:41,658 --> 01:39:46,330
-Have her follow the main cable.
-I know how to read a schematic.

997
01:40:14,942 --> 01:40:18,695
I guess that means the power's off.

998
01:40:30,416 --> 01:40:34,586
-That's not funny.
-That was great.

999
01:40:35,546 --> 01:40:39,009
Well, maybe we, we could....

1000
01:40:55,315 --> 01:40:57,944
Damn it. Dead end.

1001
01:40:58,193 --> 01:41:00,988
Wait a minute.

1002
01:41:00,988 --> 01:41:04,992
There should have been a right turn
back there somewhere.

1003
01:41:05,244 --> 01:41:07,454
Look above you.

1004
01:41:07,704 --> 01:41:11,415
<i>There should be a bundle of cable and
pipes all heading in the same direction.</i>

1005
01:41:11,665 --> 01:41:13,251
Follow that.

1006
01:41:13,501 --> 01:41:17,214
Okay. Following the piping.

1007
01:41:18,338 --> 01:41:22,635
I bet I could climb over to the other side
before you could even get to the top.

1008
01:41:22,886 --> 01:41:25,931
-What would you give me?
-Respect.

1009
01:41:26,181 --> 01:41:29,768
Come on, guys, it's not a race.

1010
01:41:29,892 --> 01:41:32,688
I see the box.

1011
01:41:32,897 --> 01:41:36,150
It says, "High Voltage."

1012
01:41:38,986 --> 01:41:41,531
Okay.

1013
01:41:44,074 --> 01:41:47,160
Good. Here we go.

1014
01:41:47,410 --> 01:41:48,995
Over the top.

1015
01:41:49,245 --> 01:41:51,622
Take your time.

1016
01:41:51,872 --> 01:41:53,373
Good. Come on.

1017
01:41:53,624 --> 01:41:57,085
Find your footing.

1018
01:41:57,795 --> 01:42:00,340
You can't throw the main switch by hand.

1019
01:42:00,590 --> 01:42:03,843
You've got to pump up the primer handle
in order to get the charge.

1020
01:42:04,093 --> 01:42:06,971
It's large, flat and grey.

1021
01:42:07,221 --> 01:42:10,392
All right, here I go. Okay?

1022
01:42:10,642 --> 01:42:15,980
One, two, three, four.

1023
01:42:16,232 --> 01:42:18,318
Okay, charged.

1024
01:42:18,567 --> 01:42:22,404
Under the words "Contact Position,"
there's a round green button...

1025
01:42:22,654 --> 01:42:25,280
...which says "Push to Close."

1026
01:42:25,531 --> 01:42:28,910
Push to close.

1027
01:42:30,870 --> 01:42:33,415
Push it.

1028
01:42:47,096 --> 01:42:51,684
The red buttons turn on
the individual park systems.

1029
01:42:51,933 --> 01:42:54,646
Switch them on.

1030
01:43:04,739 --> 01:43:06,782
-Get down now!
-You're gonna have to jump.

1031
01:43:07,031 --> 01:43:08,700
You crazy? I'm not gonna jump.

1032
01:43:08,950 --> 01:43:11,411
-Do what Dr. Grant says!
-Let go. I'll count to three.

1033
01:43:11,661 --> 01:43:15,624
One, two, three!

1034
01:43:18,169 --> 01:43:19,753
I'm coming up to get you.

1035
01:43:20,003 --> 01:43:21,672
I've got to get Tim.

1036
01:43:21,924 --> 01:43:25,218
Okay. I'm gonna count to three.

1037
01:43:26,260 --> 01:43:28,804
One...

1038
01:43:29,221 --> 01:43:31,849
...two....

1039
01:43:41,400 --> 01:43:44,111
He's not breathing.

1040
01:43:47,823 --> 01:43:51,745
I think we're back in business!

1041
01:45:30,010 --> 01:45:32,804
Clever girl.

1042
01:45:55,577 --> 01:45:58,162
No, Tim!

1043
01:45:59,622 --> 01:46:03,042
Good boy.

1044
01:46:06,087 --> 01:46:08,841
Three.

1045
01:46:12,469 --> 01:46:15,098
Hello?

1046
01:46:25,399 --> 01:46:27,985
I'm gonna have to find the others.

1047
01:46:28,235 --> 01:46:32,532
Get you to a doctor.

1048
01:46:33,031 --> 01:46:36,368
-Lex, you look after Tim.
-Yeah.

1049
01:46:36,619 --> 01:46:40,123
Your hair is all sticking up.

1050
01:46:40,582 --> 01:46:44,419
Big Tim, the human piece of toast.

1051
01:46:47,172 --> 01:46:50,885
I'll be back soon. I promise.

1052
01:47:16,660 --> 01:47:19,204
Run.

1053
01:48:34,279 --> 01:48:37,448
Just the two Raptors, right?

1054
01:48:37,700 --> 01:48:39,410
You sure the third one's contained?

1055
01:48:39,661 --> 01:48:44,790
Yes, unless they figure out
how to open doors.

1056
01:49:09,856 --> 01:49:14,570
-What is it?
-It's a Velociraptor.

1057
01:49:15,821 --> 01:49:18,865
It's inside.

1058
01:49:42,890 --> 01:49:45,517
Follow me.

1059
01:52:19,548 --> 01:52:21,425
It's in there.

1060
01:52:21,676 --> 01:52:24,471
Control room.

1061
01:52:29,266 --> 01:52:34,105
-We can call for help?
-We've got to reboot the system first.

1062
01:52:35,398 --> 01:52:37,358
The door locks!

1063
01:52:37,609 --> 01:52:41,194
Ellie, boot up the door locks!

1064
01:52:49,162 --> 01:52:51,790
No, boot up the door locks!

1065
01:52:52,039 --> 01:52:57,420
-Get back! Boot up the door locks.
-You can't hold it by yourself!

1066
01:53:04,301 --> 01:53:08,304
It's a UNIX system. I know this.

1067
01:53:08,555 --> 01:53:10,474
It's all the files of the whole park.

1068
01:53:10,725 --> 01:53:14,479
It tells you everything.
I've got to find the right file.

1069
01:53:14,728 --> 01:53:17,857
Try to reach the gun.

1070
01:53:24,822 --> 01:53:28,326
I can't get it unless I move.

1071
01:53:42,590 --> 01:53:46,720
This is it. This might be the right file.

1072
01:54:00,818 --> 01:54:03,946
-You got it!
-Yes!

1073
01:54:13,122 --> 01:54:13,997
What works?

1074
01:54:14,248 --> 01:54:18,501
All security systems are enabled.
We got it!

1075
01:54:26,843 --> 01:54:27,886
Grant.

1076
01:54:28,136 --> 01:54:31,306
Mr. Hammond, the phones are working.

1077
01:54:31,558 --> 01:54:34,518
<i>-The children all right?
-The children are fine.</i>

1078
01:54:34,769 --> 01:54:39,105
Call the mainland.
Tell 'em to send the damn helicopters.

1079
01:54:39,355 --> 01:54:42,526
It's gonna cut through the glass!

1080
01:55:35,580 --> 01:55:37,999
Move!

1081
01:57:39,871 --> 01:57:44,710
After careful consideration,
I've decided not to endorse your park.

1082
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:47,712
So have I.
