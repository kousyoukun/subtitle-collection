1
00:01:04,526 --> 00:01:06,961
Alright! We're here.

2
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,263
It's raining so hard here.

3
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,574
Must be hard to drive around.

4
00:01:11,615 --> 00:01:13,548
What? It still haven't moved?

5
00:01:22,547 --> 00:01:23,596
Did you manage to move the truck?

6
00:01:23,597 --> 00:01:25,266
It still can't be moved yet.

7
00:01:25,267 --> 00:01:25,846
Why?

8
00:01:25,847 --> 00:01:28,647
We need to wait until this car been moved.

9
00:01:28,687 --> 00:01:30,226
The owner doesn't answer the
phone even after an hour

10
00:01:30,227 --> 00:01:32,186
I even sent a text message
but still no reply.

11
00:01:32,187 --> 00:01:34,387
Damn, when its raining this much!

12
00:01:39,737 --> 00:01:40,737
Hello..

13
00:01:42,277 --> 00:01:43,410
What's happening?

14
00:01:44,157 --> 00:01:45,824
Wow, this guy is so rude!

15
00:01:47,447 --> 00:01:49,847
Wow, are there really people like this?

16
00:01:50,827 --> 00:01:51,827
Seriously.

17
00:02:14,808 --> 00:02:15,808
Damn.

18
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:39,129
Bastard!

19
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:41,629
You!!

20
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,320
Mister!!

21
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,260
Me?

22
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,360
Yes you!

23
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,239
Why didn't you answer your phone
when we called this much?

24
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,239
The cargo truck can't be moved.

25
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,409
We had to wait for your car to
be moved for over an hour.

26
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:13,959
I set the phone to vibrate.

27
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,959
But earlier I heard your cell
phone ringing loudly?

28
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,027
I didn't hear it.

29
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,860
I was sleeping inside.

30
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,340
OK?

31
00:03:20,374 --> 00:03:22,307
Ahh I really don't understand.

32
00:03:22,551 --> 00:03:23,590
What do you mean?

33
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:25,840
Is it so hard to apologize to someone?

34
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:27,974
What do I need to apologize for?

35
00:03:28,261 --> 00:03:30,350
You are the one who should apologize.

36
00:03:30,351 --> 00:03:32,640
This is Sunday! It's not good
to disturb people's holidays.

37
00:03:32,641 --> 00:03:35,770
My car was parked well, but still told
to move, what a waste of gas!

38
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:37,440
If you take all day to move house.

39
00:03:37,441 --> 00:03:39,508
How much more annoying are you!

40
00:03:40,651 --> 00:03:41,551
Am I wrong?

41
00:03:41,651 --> 00:03:43,070
Can you speak well and politely?

42
00:03:43,071 --> 00:03:44,400
I'm speaking polietly, arent I?

43
00:03:44,401 --> 00:03:46,468
Then why did you poke my chest?

44
00:03:49,161 --> 00:03:51,029
I think you need to exercise.

45
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:53,732
What?

46
00:03:53,752 --> 00:03:55,541
I said you should exercise!

47
00:03:55,542 --> 00:03:56,542
Dear!

48
00:03:59,092 --> 00:04:00,092
Hello..

49
00:04:01,962 --> 00:04:04,162
Oh, this is must be your family..

50
00:04:04,802 --> 00:04:05,802
Welcome.

51
00:04:06,472 --> 00:04:07,721
Dad, were you fighting?

52
00:04:07,722 --> 00:04:08,722
Fighting?

53
00:04:10,932 --> 00:04:12,249
Fighting? What fighting?

54
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,850
Fighting between adults?

55
00:04:14,062 --> 00:04:15,395
No, we didn't fight.

56
00:04:25,033 --> 00:04:26,033
It's going up..

57
00:04:35,123 --> 00:04:36,456
Now its coming down.

58
00:04:40,593 --> 00:04:41,926
It's raining so hard.

59
00:04:47,013 --> 00:04:48,302
You must be new here.

60
00:04:48,303 --> 00:04:49,303
Oh yes, hello.

61
00:04:49,684 --> 00:04:50,603
You live here too?

62
00:04:50,604 --> 00:04:51,303
Yes.

63
00:04:51,304 --> 00:04:52,393
Oh, I live in 501

64
00:04:52,394 --> 00:04:53,594
nice to meet you..

65
00:04:53,724 --> 00:04:54,724
Oh the same.

66
00:04:55,774 --> 00:04:56,774
Oh my.

67
00:04:57,234 --> 00:04:59,523
I heard that moving on a rainy day
is said to make a lot of money.

68
00:04:59,524 --> 00:05:00,524
Ah, thank you.

69
00:05:01,984 --> 00:05:02,984
Have a good day.

70
00:05:03,274 --> 00:05:04,274
Yes. be careful.

71
00:05:12,414 --> 00:05:13,414
Hello.

72
00:05:14,664 --> 00:05:15,664
Sung-Hoon.

73
00:05:16,084 --> 00:05:17,163
If you are hungry.

74
00:05:17,164 --> 00:05:18,833
Just use the microwave to heat the rice.

75
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:19,674
Yes.

76
00:05:19,675 --> 00:05:22,075
And never open the door to strangers.

77
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:23,255
Yes.

78
00:05:23,385 --> 00:05:24,652
Mom come home early.

79
00:05:25,095 --> 00:05:26,764
If it rains, close the windows!

80
00:05:26,765 --> 00:05:28,500
- Alright.
- Good!

81
00:05:42,245 --> 00:05:43,445
Its very relaxing.

82
00:05:44,775 --> 00:05:46,444
Its because this is our home.

83
00:05:46,445 --> 00:05:48,712
This house is very nice.

84
00:05:49,366 --> 00:05:50,966
Because this is our home.

85
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,383
This house is really very comfortable.

86
00:05:56,586 --> 00:05:58,719
That's because this is our house.

87
00:06:01,796 --> 00:06:02,796
Dad.

88
00:06:02,886 --> 00:06:04,486
When will the TV arrive?

89
00:06:04,846 --> 00:06:05,846
Su-Chan.

90
00:06:06,006 --> 00:06:08,006
Take a look at our house first

91
00:06:08,766 --> 00:06:09,849
TV TV!!

92
00:06:12,936 --> 00:06:13,943
Here! Su-Chan!

93
00:06:17,186 --> 00:06:20,276
Honey Because you're going to
be working much harder now.

94
00:06:20,277 --> 00:06:21,526
Exercise a bit more and.

95
00:06:21,527 --> 00:06:22,794
Learn English again.

96
00:06:23,197 --> 00:06:24,664
Do everything you want.

97
00:06:26,867 --> 00:06:28,667
We still have a lot of debt.

98
00:06:28,947 --> 00:06:30,147
We need more money

99
00:06:30,367 --> 00:06:32,634
I will pay the tuition fee for you.

100
00:06:35,747 --> 00:06:39,747
You seem thrilled to hear your
wife pay the money for you?

101
00:06:42,547 --> 00:06:43,547
Stupid!

102
00:06:53,018 --> 00:06:56,018
Yah! Haven't had breakfast
like this in years.

103
00:06:56,768 --> 00:06:59,187
Busy company business makes
me unable to eat breakfast.

104
00:06:59,188 --> 00:07:00,987
Su-Chan, let's have breakfast!

105
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:01,988
Ok.

106
00:07:02,028 --> 00:07:03,028
Here we go

107
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,291
eat a lot, please.

108
00:07:06,698 --> 00:07:08,617
Do you want me to show you something fun?

109
00:07:08,618 --> 00:07:09,818
What? what's that?

110
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:16,168
Great catch!

111
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:19,572
Wow? What did the movers do yesterday?

112
00:07:20,549 --> 00:07:21,758
This table should be placed stably.

113
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,092
No! they can also roll on the floor.

114
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:28,546
Hey, why are you even playing while eating?

115
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,960
Damn!!!

116
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,379
Why are you so afraid like that?

117
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,973
I'm just a human.

118
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,145
Who's scared?!

119
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,310
It's obvious you're scared?

120
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,510
Come on in!

121
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,469
Enter!

122
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,799
You are right, go here.

123
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,133
You have to stay fit.

124
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,390
You are right.

125
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,349
For you, I give it cheaper
Come on!

126
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,179
Are you the owner of this Gym place?

127
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,189
I'm not the boss.

128
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,274
But something similar

129
00:08:17,776 --> 00:08:19,243
I'm the coach here.

130
00:08:19,561 --> 00:08:20,828
Oh, look at that...

131
00:08:21,151 --> 00:08:22,480
I'm afraid it's too late

132
00:08:22,481 --> 00:08:24,281
I will consider coming back.

133
00:08:24,526 --> 00:08:26,460
What's too late? Really weird.

134
00:08:29,531 --> 00:08:30,531
Excuse me.

135
00:08:30,871 --> 00:08:32,198
Yes Yes Good!

136
00:08:32,741 --> 00:08:33,276
Ok so.

137
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:34,750
You made the right decision.

138
00:08:34,751 --> 00:08:35,751
Not that...

139
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,920
Stop it! Let's register right away.

140
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:38,920
House.. House..

141
00:08:38,921 --> 00:08:40,290
- House.
- What happened to the house?

142
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:43,024
Do you think our houses are a bit tilted?

143
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:45,604
How can our houses be tilted?

144
00:08:45,721 --> 00:08:47,511
I think my living room
floor is a bit slanted.

145
00:08:47,512 --> 00:08:49,379
It unbalances household items.

146
00:08:49,552 --> 00:08:50,391
No! no! No!

147
00:08:50,392 --> 00:08:52,192
My living room is very flat.

148
00:08:52,682 --> 00:08:55,882
- If you have marbles in your house...
- WHAT!!

149
00:08:55,932 --> 00:08:57,199
I'm a grown man now.

150
00:08:57,482 --> 00:08:59,231
Do you think I still play with marbles?

151
00:08:59,232 --> 00:08:59,941
No.

152
00:08:59,942 --> 00:09:00,901
Forget it, let's register

153
00:09:00,902 --> 00:09:01,902
I am late!

154
00:09:02,402 --> 00:09:03,111
Strange people!!

155
00:09:03,112 --> 00:09:04,179
What am I doing?

156
00:09:04,652 --> 00:09:06,585
What is such a person called?

157
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,400
- Chief!
- Yes.

158
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,712
I heard you bought a house
in Seoul and have moved?

159
00:09:20,713 --> 00:09:21,713
Yes.

160
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:22,672
Congratulations.

161
00:09:22,673 --> 00:09:24,132
Why didn't you tell us?

162
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:25,866
Congratulations Chief Park.

163
00:09:26,593 --> 00:09:28,660
Oh, it's not that big of a deal.

164
00:09:29,013 --> 00:09:30,013
Congratulations.

165
00:09:30,763 --> 00:09:32,296
Thanks, all of you.

166
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:36,640
To celebrate Mr. Park who
bought a house in Seoul city.

167
00:09:36,723 --> 00:09:38,002
Let's all clap!

168
00:09:39,943 --> 00:09:40,732
Clap Clap.

169
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:42,362
Our chief Park bought a house in Seoul.

170
00:09:42,363 --> 00:09:43,525
His own house!

171
00:09:44,403 --> 00:09:45,823
Don't clap, don't clap.

172
00:09:45,824 --> 00:09:47,291
It's not something big.

173
00:09:47,994 --> 00:09:48,953
In which neighborhood do you live?

174
00:09:48,954 --> 00:09:49,954
Changshou-dong.

175
00:09:50,744 --> 00:09:51,744
Ah that.

176
00:09:52,414 --> 00:09:54,454
Isn't there an industrial complex
in Changshou-dong?

177
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,413
The industrial complex has
been gone for a long time.

178
00:09:56,414 --> 00:09:59,543
When I was little, my dad's
car was dumped there.

179
00:09:59,544 --> 00:10:02,811
The car waste plant has been
gone for a long time.

180
00:10:03,084 --> 00:10:04,923
Now there is an eco-friendly community.

181
00:10:04,924 --> 00:10:07,924
Isn't there a noisy subway
in Changshou-dong?

182
00:10:08,844 --> 00:10:10,683
How can I hear the sound of the subway?

183
00:10:10,684 --> 00:10:12,553
Then how can a new building be built now?

184
00:10:12,554 --> 00:10:15,353
Also the wall is surrounded
by two or three layers.

185
00:10:15,354 --> 00:10:18,488
Even if there is a war,
we can't hear anything.

186
00:10:20,145 --> 00:10:21,064
Is this your house?

187
00:10:21,065 --> 00:10:22,065
No, no!

188
00:10:24,405 --> 00:10:25,672
Watch the ball roll.

189
00:10:25,865 --> 00:10:27,675
The ball just rolls on the floor.

190
00:10:28,115 --> 00:10:30,459
Is this the floor of a room
or a football field?

191
00:10:30,655 --> 00:10:33,074
- This is a house?
- When are you guys coming?

192
00:10:33,075 --> 00:10:35,034
When will you guys visit for house warming?

193
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:37,454
- Its nice if its sooner.
- Ok. The sooner the better, right?

194
00:10:37,455 --> 00:10:38,455
I accept.

195
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:40,456
- Please work.
- Okay.

196
00:10:47,596 --> 00:10:49,596
Why are you playing with that?

197
00:10:53,976 --> 00:10:55,976
I heard if the house is tilted..

198
00:10:56,266 --> 00:11:00,799
The window frame will change and
the sliding window will get stuck.

199
00:11:06,446 --> 00:11:08,093
Is it okay now?

200
00:11:15,367 --> 00:11:16,450
Excuse me.

201
00:11:18,417 --> 00:11:19,417
Anyone here?

202
00:11:21,207 --> 00:11:22,626
You made an appointment beforehand right?

203
00:11:22,627 --> 00:11:24,376
I made an appointment online.

204
00:11:24,377 --> 00:11:25,510
For half discount.

205
00:11:26,257 --> 00:11:26,836
Great!

206
00:11:26,837 --> 00:11:27,837
I want too.

207
00:11:30,597 --> 00:11:31,386
How is it?

208
00:11:31,387 --> 00:11:33,766
If our family could hang a family portrait,
it would be beautiful, wouldn't it?

209
00:11:33,767 --> 00:11:34,667
Yes.

210
00:11:34,767 --> 00:11:35,767
Looks real good.

211
00:11:36,057 --> 00:11:37,057
Right?

212
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:38,606
The owner of this place.

213
00:11:38,607 --> 00:11:39,940
Has it set up nicely.

214
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,500
It's supposed to be this cool.

215
00:11:42,607 --> 00:11:43,607
Hello.

216
00:11:45,488 --> 00:11:46,488
Hel..

217
00:11:47,068 --> 00:11:48,068
OH..

218
00:11:52,828 --> 00:11:54,917
Why do you always get scared
every time I see you?

219
00:11:59,338 --> 00:12:00,911
Is the owner of this place away?

220
00:12:03,918 --> 00:12:04,986
I am the owner.

221
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:06,546
Hello.

222
00:12:06,548 --> 00:12:07,427
Gosh.. hello.

223
00:12:07,428 --> 00:12:09,431
Hi hello too.

224
00:12:10,548 --> 00:12:11,948
You are very handsome.

225
00:12:12,678 --> 00:12:14,103
How about the gym upstairs?

226
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:15,848
The gym was opened by my sister

227
00:12:15,849 --> 00:12:18,382
I just... help check it every few days.

228
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:21,076
This's my main task.

229
00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:23,482
Okay? You are very well dressed today.

230
00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:25,189
Set.

231
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:27,199
Set.

232
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:29,368
Okay, this is a good composition.

233
00:12:29,369 --> 00:12:30,369
Lets shoot.

234
00:12:30,739 --> 00:12:31,739
Oh madam.

235
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:34,661
Your posture is too elegant.

236
00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:37,709
Hello sir.

237
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:39,328
Do you feel uncomfortable?

238
00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:40,846
Let's take a quick photo now.

239
00:12:43,249 --> 00:12:44,249
Okay, then.

240
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,420
Let's put on a nice expression

241
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,605
I wil take a portrait of
this harmonious family.

242
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:51,791
Pity.

243
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:53,970
Come one, smile.

244
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,445
Hey that's great.

245
00:12:58,461 --> 00:12:59,189
Come on!

246
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,523
I'll take a picture!

247
00:13:00,664 --> 00:13:01,664
One…

248
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:03,481
Two three!

249
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,844
Ahh so nice.

250
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,609
Wow, what a great result

251
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,277
Seoul looks more beautiful when it rains.

252
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,981
We came here from far away empty handed.

253
00:13:14,371 --> 00:13:16,567
It took 11 years to own my own house.

254
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:18,861
You worked hard.

255
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,321
Its all thanks to you

256
00:13:22,251 --> 00:13:23,861
I'm the one thankful to you.

257
00:13:24,421 --> 00:13:25,353
Let's drink

258
00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:26,421
I'm driving.

259
00:13:26,591 --> 00:13:27,591
This is Seoul.

260
00:13:28,011 --> 00:13:29,550
How expensive is it to find a driver?

261
00:13:29,551 --> 00:13:30,551
I'll pay.

262
00:13:30,591 --> 00:13:31,760
Okay then, let's have a drink.

263
00:13:31,761 --> 00:13:32,761
Cheers!

264
00:13:33,141 --> 00:13:34,141
I want too.

265
00:13:35,061 --> 00:13:35,810
Cheers!!

266
00:13:35,811 --> 00:13:37,390
Mister driver, where are you?

267
00:13:37,391 --> 00:13:39,276
Ah! I'm here.

268
00:13:39,441 --> 00:13:40,479
Ah I see you

269
00:13:40,481 --> 00:13:41,575
I can see you.

270
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:47,638
I will do my best.

271
00:13:48,242 --> 00:13:50,255
To take you home comfortably.

272
00:13:51,242 --> 00:13:52,786
Hello.

273
00:13:52,822 --> 00:13:54,083
Oh hello hello.

274
00:13:54,905 --> 00:13:55,905
Hello.

275
00:13:57,082 --> 00:13:58,749
Why are you afraid again?

276
00:13:59,332 --> 00:14:01,865
The speed limit ahead is 60 kilometers.

277
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:03,075
Stop.

278
00:14:05,422 --> 00:14:06,422
Stop!

279
00:14:06,552 --> 00:14:08,952
Photographed.. we were photographed!

280
00:14:09,422 --> 00:14:11,011
Ahh we're being photographed
by speed cameras.

281
00:14:11,012 --> 00:14:12,079
Not photographed.

282
00:14:12,803 --> 00:14:14,536
I saw a speed camera flash.

283
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,722
Gosh, we're not being photographed.

284
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:19,732
Yellow... the yellow light mean to stop.
How can you go on?

285
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:23,933
Some people stop at a yellow light
and some continue to drive

286
00:14:23,983 --> 00:14:25,942
I'm one of those people who keep driving.

287
00:14:25,943 --> 00:14:27,572
According to traffic laws you must stop.

288
00:14:27,573 --> 00:14:28,573
No.. We can go.

289
00:14:29,403 --> 00:14:30,403
Wow.

290
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,638
Wow... I'll show you.

291
00:14:36,946 --> 00:14:38,413
I found it, here look!

292
00:14:38,663 --> 00:14:39,663
This!

293
00:14:39,873 --> 00:14:40,873
See?

294
00:14:41,623 --> 00:14:42,524
Look!

295
00:14:42,544 --> 00:14:43,544
Here look!

296
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:44,924
We have arrived.

297
00:14:46,384 --> 00:14:49,717
Isn't this telling the yellow
light means to stop?

298
00:14:50,174 --> 00:14:52,574
Oh, Su-Chan did you have a good time.

299
00:14:53,094 --> 00:14:54,393
- Right.
- Thank you Uncle.

300
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:55,394
Please go inside.

301
00:14:57,224 --> 00:14:58,224
Hey.

302
00:15:02,314 --> 00:15:03,563
Do you prefer anything?

303
00:15:03,564 --> 00:15:04,903
It's easy for us if you like something.

304
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,254
- Maybe something you need in your new home.
- What's the budget?

305
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:08,471
200,000 or more

306
00:15:08,693 --> 00:15:09,745
200,000?

307
00:15:10,904 --> 00:15:12,364
Manager Kim!
Isn't that Eun-Joo?

308
00:15:12,365 --> 00:15:13,464
Go help her.

309
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:18,282
Eun-Joo, just let it be,
I'll do it later.

310
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,275
No need

311
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,675
- I can do it.
- Okay.

312
00:15:24,085 --> 00:15:25,114
Damn bastard!

313
00:15:27,085 --> 00:15:28,152
Cooking utensil.

314
00:15:29,215 --> 00:15:30,482
Electronic blankets.

315
00:15:30,595 --> 00:15:32,094
Can't you just give me some money?

316
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:35,184
- It will be engraved with your name.
- Just give me the money

317
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:37,949
I have something I want and
am a little short on money.

318
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,050
What is this chair?

319
00:15:44,946 --> 00:15:47,525
Company collegues bought
me this as a present.

320
00:15:47,526 --> 00:15:48,793
Isn't it expensive?

321
00:15:49,236 --> 00:15:50,236
How do I know

322
00:15:50,776 --> 00:15:54,035
I'm the one whose tired,
why are you the one on the expensive chair?

323
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,769
It's common chair, common.

324
00:15:56,576 --> 00:15:57,205
Dad

325
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,406
I also want to try

326
00:15:59,206 --> 00:16:00,206
just go play.

327
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:01,416
No.

328
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,145
Just let him try it.

329
00:16:03,706 --> 00:16:05,875
Isn't it common property which
whole familiy can use?

330
00:16:05,876 --> 00:16:07,809
My wife want to sit on it too.

331
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,095
Then you just sleep in that rocking chair.

332
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:12,096
Sleep forever!

333
00:16:13,017 --> 00:16:14,017
Let's go.

334
00:16:55,388 --> 00:16:56,855
Why is this happening?

335
00:16:57,888 --> 00:17:01,221
What is wrong? It's not like
getting hit by a rock.

336
00:17:03,478 --> 00:17:04,478
Could it break by itself?

337
00:17:12,029 --> 00:17:13,029
Mister.

338
00:17:14,739 --> 00:17:15,739
I didn't do it.

339
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,514
Who else if not you?

340
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:20,624
Damn, it's really not me!

341
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:22,663
Fix it as soon as possible.

342
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:24,088
Or do you want me to call the Police?

343
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:26,289
- Ah!
- What do you mean police?

344
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:27,418
Why are you looking like that?

345
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:30,161
Alright, then work hard okay.

346
00:17:30,469 --> 00:17:33,318
- First, I'll take care of it...
- I don't have to help you.

347
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,109
Yes yes.

348
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,569
It's a newly built 5 storey
residential building.

349
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:53,264
Of course the municipal council should
take care of unsafe development.

350
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,264
Is there any visible damage?

351
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,670
So the residents should
have a meeting first..

352
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,678
And must all residents agree?

353
00:18:05,201 --> 00:18:06,749
This building where we live in.

354
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,817
Maintenance service is not good.

355
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:13,050
Frankly I want to tell you all is that
something is wrong now.

356
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:14,180
What's wrong with the house?

357
00:18:14,181 --> 00:18:16,640
First of all the windows
start to get stuck.

358
00:18:16,641 --> 00:18:17,809
And it's not good.

359
00:18:17,811 --> 00:18:21,088
This proves that our house is tilted.

360
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:24,150
- Damn the tilted house again!
- Our house is tilted?

361
00:18:24,151 --> 00:18:27,020
If it is reported that our house is like
this, it will cause house prices to fall.

362
00:18:27,021 --> 00:18:29,690
- That's right.
- But my window is stuck too.

363
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,490
How about house 202? Is it alright?

364
00:18:31,491 --> 00:18:35,158
Ah.. I'm at the store more often,
so I'm rarely at home.

365
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:36,990
How about number 502?
How is it?

366
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:40,371
I just always smell of smoke from below.

367
00:18:40,582 --> 00:18:43,509
And the windows of our house have long
been closed I'm not so sure either.

368
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:45,699
Maybe from house number 401?

369
00:18:49,382 --> 00:18:51,314
No one smokes in my house.

370
00:18:51,762 --> 00:18:53,767
If its not you who else then?

371
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,634
Look at your dry face.

372
00:18:55,722 --> 00:18:57,980
Isn't it like a bamboo pole?

373
00:18:59,102 --> 00:19:01,181
Ahh damn, what a bastard is this woman?!

374
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:03,560
I've quit smoking for over 10 years.

375
00:19:03,562 --> 00:19:04,973
What smell of smoke?

376
00:19:05,522 --> 00:19:06,151
Okay.

377
00:19:06,152 --> 00:19:07,285
Try to smell this.

378
00:19:07,862 --> 00:19:08,901
There is a smell of smoke!

379
00:19:08,902 --> 00:19:10,032
- What?
- He smells of cigarettes.

380
00:19:10,033 --> 00:19:12,166
Don't fight, please don't fight!

381
00:19:12,493 --> 00:19:14,322
You two are like husband and wife.

382
00:19:14,323 --> 00:19:15,991
You are sinners.

383
00:19:15,993 --> 00:19:19,331
Everyone, stop arguing, stop arguing.

384
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:22,946
No, they suspect me.
I hate being suspected!

385
00:19:23,623 --> 00:19:25,872
Ahh, I want to die.

386
00:19:30,173 --> 00:19:31,481
Dad, next month.

387
00:19:32,053 --> 00:19:34,512
Will send you to Civil Servant school.

388
00:19:34,513 --> 00:19:35,551
Do not worry.

389
00:19:35,973 --> 00:19:37,221
But dad has no money.

390
00:19:37,893 --> 00:19:39,893
Hey, dad has distributed flyers.

391
00:19:39,894 --> 00:19:41,839
Worked in call center.

392
00:19:48,484 --> 00:19:49,871
If you smoke.

393
00:19:51,154 --> 00:19:53,504
Go up to the top floor and smoke.

394
00:19:54,034 --> 00:19:58,243
The occupant of our upper house said
the smell of smoke, they said.

395
00:19:58,244 --> 00:20:00,043
They can smell the smoke.

396
00:20:00,664 --> 00:20:01,676
I don't smoke.

397
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:04,253
Right, you don't smoke, do you?

398
00:20:04,254 --> 00:20:05,663
Look, I'm going to go to tell her...

399
00:20:05,664 --> 00:20:08,264
I have to give a 502 tenant a lesson...

400
00:20:08,835 --> 00:20:09,634
Hey Seung-tae.

401
00:20:09,635 --> 00:20:10,924
Daddy won't say, eat, eat.

402
00:20:10,925 --> 00:20:11,925
Let's eat.

403
00:20:20,685 --> 00:20:21,585
Come out.

404
00:20:21,645 --> 00:20:22,564
- Take the gifts -Okay.

405
00:20:22,565 --> 00:20:23,774
The environment is quite clean, right?

406
00:20:23,775 --> 00:20:24,524
Let's go!

407
00:20:24,525 --> 00:20:26,592
Calm and it's suitable for kids.

408
00:20:27,195 --> 00:20:28,528
It's very quiet here.

409
00:20:33,115 --> 00:20:34,115
What is this?

410
00:20:34,615 --> 00:20:38,048
The old woman who lives in 301
keeps threatening me to death.

411
00:20:38,326 --> 00:20:40,125
It's the plastic used to
make winter Kimchi.

412
00:20:40,126 --> 00:20:41,785
That's pretty good in my opinion.

413
00:20:41,786 --> 00:20:43,453
It's definitely not glass.

414
00:20:43,836 --> 00:20:45,674
Of course! I know that.

415
00:20:45,706 --> 00:20:47,173
This is not real glass.

416
00:20:47,626 --> 00:20:49,400
You are so stiff.

417
00:20:50,176 --> 00:20:52,170
I haven't seen winter
kimchi in a long time.

418
00:20:52,426 --> 00:20:54,175
They came here for house warming right?

419
00:20:54,176 --> 00:20:56,843
Hello, we are all co-workers of Chief Park.

420
00:20:56,846 --> 00:20:59,861
Ah, apparently you are a Chief

421
00:21:00,186 --> 00:21:01,475
thank you

422
00:21:01,556 --> 00:21:03,356
hey no. 501, wait a minute!

423
00:21:03,766 --> 00:21:05,291
I found some flaws.

424
00:21:05,316 --> 00:21:06,316
Look at this!

425
00:21:08,607 --> 00:21:11,245
It's in that back parking lot

426
00:21:11,487 --> 00:21:12,954
I think it has a crack.

427
00:21:12,987 --> 00:21:15,116
This is the entrance to the parking lot.

428
00:21:15,117 --> 00:21:16,866
You saw it right, the big crack.

429
00:21:16,867 --> 00:21:18,866
You have to take a closer
look to find them!

430
00:21:18,867 --> 00:21:21,294
Our house is really a mess.

431
00:21:21,377 --> 00:21:22,456
There's more here.

432
00:21:22,457 --> 00:21:24,706
Are you saying this is
the current situation?

433
00:21:24,707 --> 00:21:26,669
Current situation!!

434
00:21:26,707 --> 00:21:29,216
This is not only a current problem
but a future problem too.

435
00:21:29,217 --> 00:21:30,836
This is amazing. Look over there!

436
00:21:30,837 --> 00:21:32,255
There are more.

437
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:33,635
Alright now!!

438
00:21:33,637 --> 00:21:34,904
Take a look at this.

439
00:21:34,967 --> 00:21:37,238
It's everywhere here.

440
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,419
This is...

441
00:21:39,138 --> 00:21:40,466
Come see.

442
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:44,437
This is dangerous, seriously!

443
00:21:44,438 --> 00:21:45,219
How come people live here?

444
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:46,852
Why do you press that?

445
00:21:47,046 --> 00:21:48,610
Come here! straight through here!

446
00:21:48,753 --> 00:21:49,753
Enter!

447
00:21:52,408 --> 00:21:53,308
That is true.

448
00:21:53,368 --> 00:21:54,368
Come on in.

449
00:21:54,738 --> 00:21:55,738
Enter!

450
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:57,436
Why, thank you.

451
00:21:57,438 --> 00:21:59,327
- You bought a lot.
- Thank you.

452
00:21:59,328 --> 00:22:00,789
- Yes.
- Thank you.

453
00:22:01,158 --> 00:22:02,547
Hello.

454
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:03,788
Su-Chan!

455
00:22:05,418 --> 00:22:07,218
Welcome, come in!

456
00:22:07,419 --> 00:22:09,152
The house is very spacious.

457
00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:11,758
- It smells great.
- It's not that much though.

458
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:12,759
Hello.

459
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:18,325
How much does this house cost?

460
00:22:19,179 --> 00:22:21,736
Um... 3 Billion.

461
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:24,338
Gosh... Amazing!

462
00:22:24,859 --> 00:22:26,338
What's amazing?

463
00:22:26,689 --> 00:22:27,689
That!

464
00:22:28,939 --> 00:22:31,318
Isn't it very similar to Mount Everest?

465
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:34,052
The mountain you see
but you can't visit.

466
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,249
Even if you win the jackpot,
you won't be able to go there.

467
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,517
Who doesn't understand Apartments?

468
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,843
Don't you understand the market?

469
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,760
I wouldn't buy it if I couldn't afford it.

470
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,693
You have to find money by taking a loan.

471
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,177
Then you can buy an apartment.

472
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,626
Manager Jung bought an apartment
for 450 million earlier this year.

473
00:22:58,628 --> 00:22:59,849
Hey don't say that.

474
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,849
House prices increased by
200 million in 6 months

475
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:02,938
200 million??

476
00:23:07,401 --> 00:23:08,401
Yes!!

477
00:23:08,481 --> 00:23:10,531
Wow up 200 million.

478
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:13,188
Up 200 million.

479
00:23:13,611 --> 00:23:15,219
That much..

480
00:23:21,541 --> 00:23:22,541
Eun-Joo?!

481
00:23:25,421 --> 00:23:27,880
Its not polite to leave the table
until you're done drinking.

482
00:23:27,881 --> 00:23:29,481
Come here sit down again.

483
00:23:30,131 --> 00:23:32,058
I want to drink alone.

484
00:23:32,461 --> 00:23:33,461
Suddenly?

485
00:23:34,511 --> 00:23:35,511
Yes!

486
00:23:39,012 --> 00:23:40,101
Eun-Joo, your glass is empty.

487
00:23:40,102 --> 00:23:40,891
Manager Kim!

488
00:23:40,892 --> 00:23:42,759
Please pour some for Eun-Joo.

489
00:23:44,772 --> 00:23:46,105
Where are you going?

490
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:47,692
Toilet!

491
00:23:47,732 --> 00:23:51,199
Oh, I should get some watermelon
from the fridge too.

492
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:55,201
Manager Jung, why aren't you drinking?

493
00:23:55,202 --> 00:23:56,535
I have to drive home.

494
00:23:56,612 --> 00:23:57,991
Just drinking coke is enough

495
00:23:57,992 --> 00:23:59,071
I will help call a driver for you

496
00:23:59,072 --> 00:24:01,031
I really just want to drink coke.

497
00:24:01,032 --> 00:24:02,248
No need no need

498
00:24:02,332 --> 00:24:03,751
I have the driver's phone number.

499
00:24:03,752 --> 00:24:04,752
Really crazy.

500
00:24:05,963 --> 00:24:06,963
Here he is.

501
00:24:07,423 --> 00:24:08,323
This.

502
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:09,733
- Let's drink!
- No.

503
00:24:10,173 --> 00:24:11,422
- Let's drink!
- No need.

504
00:24:11,423 --> 00:24:12,342
It does not matter.

505
00:24:12,343 --> 00:24:13,810
- It's okay.
- I'm serious.

506
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:22,893
Damn it!

507
00:24:24,393 --> 00:24:25,393
What?

508
00:24:26,853 --> 00:24:28,767
I will take you comfortably.

509
00:24:45,004 --> 00:24:46,004
You came sir!

510
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:46,793
You came.

511
00:24:46,794 --> 00:24:48,253
Oh you called the right person.

512
00:24:48,254 --> 00:24:50,833
How can you drive if you drink like this?

513
00:24:50,834 --> 00:24:54,302
This master will drive despite
the yellow light.

514
00:24:54,304 --> 00:24:57,237
So you guys have to keep
an eye on it, okay?

515
00:24:57,594 --> 00:24:58,594
Dear.

516
00:25:00,094 --> 00:25:01,361
Have you eaten yet?

517
00:25:01,514 --> 00:25:02,839
Are you asking for real?

518
00:25:03,684 --> 00:25:04,684
Yes.

519
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:10,747
Oh brother?

520
00:25:12,655 --> 00:25:15,234
Kimchi winter plastic installer is here.

521
00:25:15,235 --> 00:25:16,994
Come on I'll pour you a glass.

522
00:25:16,995 --> 00:25:17,995
No, no!

523
00:25:18,285 --> 00:25:19,454
Cause I'll be driving.

524
00:25:19,455 --> 00:25:21,922
Photographer Jeong Man, food is ready.

525
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:23,375
Is that right.

526
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:24,334
Ok.

527
00:25:24,335 --> 00:25:25,335
Cheers.

528
00:25:26,415 --> 00:25:27,415
Cheers.

529
00:25:27,455 --> 00:25:30,714
Why didn't you have a drink
earlier Manager Jung?

530
00:25:30,715 --> 00:25:32,582
Because the driver is here..

531
00:25:33,255 --> 00:25:35,589
- Drink!
- When are we going home?

532
00:25:35,846 --> 00:25:36,846
Why?

533
00:25:42,516 --> 00:25:43,849
Wait a little longer.

534
00:25:45,936 --> 00:25:47,069
What time is it.

535
00:25:48,436 --> 00:25:49,969
Why are you whispering?

536
00:25:51,396 --> 00:25:52,928
Why whisper??

537
00:25:55,406 --> 00:25:56,739
Are you guys dating?

538
00:25:57,036 --> 00:25:58,036
No!

539
00:25:59,906 --> 00:26:00,655
No.

540
00:26:00,656 --> 00:26:01,656
Chief.

541
00:26:01,706 --> 00:26:03,283
Don't talk nonsense.

542
00:26:03,326 --> 00:26:04,794
Am I talking nonsense?

543
00:26:05,417 --> 00:26:07,612
Mr. Park really misunderstood.

544
00:26:07,707 --> 00:26:09,040
Did I misunderstand?

545
00:26:09,417 --> 00:26:10,977
Chief Park, are you drunk?

546
00:26:10,978 --> 00:26:12,045
You're not wrong.

547
00:26:14,927 --> 00:26:16,594
We really love each other.

548
00:26:21,517 --> 00:26:22,870
You bastard!!

549
00:26:23,308 --> 00:26:24,306
What are you doing?

550
00:26:24,307 --> 00:26:25,936
They say they love each other

551
00:26:25,937 --> 00:26:27,004
I'm sorry senior.

552
00:26:27,107 --> 00:26:28,646
Don't call senior bastard!!

553
00:26:28,647 --> 00:26:31,114
You're not my junior at all bastard!!

554
00:26:32,487 --> 00:26:33,487
Hyo-Jeong!!

555
00:26:35,198 --> 00:26:36,987
You can't call that name asshole!

556
00:26:36,988 --> 00:26:38,655
Yes yes I'm ready to go!!

557
00:26:42,328 --> 00:26:44,728
Manager Kim, don't follow your past!

558
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:54,678
Drink.

559
00:26:56,428 --> 00:26:57,428
Drink.

560
00:27:01,888 --> 00:27:03,155
It must be hard but.

561
00:27:03,438 --> 00:27:04,972
Now its time to go home.

562
00:27:05,189 --> 00:27:08,608
It's not good to stay in someone
else's house for too long.

563
00:27:08,609 --> 00:27:09,809
Where do you live?

564
00:27:11,069 --> 00:27:11,969
Cheongun-dong.

565
00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:13,162
Hmm Cheongun-dong.

566
00:27:13,739 --> 00:27:16,444
Where does Miss Rocking Chair live?

567
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:18,069
Anyang.

568
00:27:18,329 --> 00:27:19,329
Anyang?

569
00:27:19,909 --> 00:27:20,658
The car keys!

570
00:27:20,659 --> 00:27:23,259
I will go to Anyang first then Cheongun.

571
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:24,916
But I won't drive.

572
00:27:26,499 --> 00:27:27,499
Why?

573
00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:30,619
I don't have a car.

574
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,589
Then we'll use our car.

575
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,969
Go to Anyang first then Cheongun.

576
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:39,639
Starting from Changsin-Dong...
30,000 plus 50,000.

577
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,809
Originally 90,000.

578
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:42,277
Makes you 80,000 only!

579
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,577
Eighty thousand????

580
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:45,689
Why?

581
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,309
This is the discounted price.

582
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,310
Just sleep here.

583
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:50,407
There are 3 rooms in our house.

584
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:51,860
Wow.

585
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,602
I have to take you home soon.

586
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:57,409
Because your parents should
be worried about you.

587
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:58,410
Right?

588
00:27:58,490 --> 00:27:59,926
I live alone.

589
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:01,950
Oh.

590
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,160
Living alone.

591
00:28:03,207 --> 00:28:04,940
There are 3 rooms, 3 rooms.

592
00:28:05,211 --> 00:28:07,120
My son is sleeping in his room

593
00:28:07,121 --> 00:28:10,028
I sleep with my wife in that room.

594
00:28:10,211 --> 00:28:13,747
In the other room, let Manager Kim
and Eunjoo sleep together.

595
00:28:14,711 --> 00:28:15,778
And..

596
00:28:19,051 --> 00:28:21,447
Su-Chan sleeps in Su-Chan's room.

597
00:28:21,511 --> 00:28:23,770
In the other one you sleep
with Manager Jung.

598
00:28:23,771 --> 00:28:27,501
In the last room, Su-Chan't mother sleeps
with the woman who lives alone.

599
00:28:28,141 --> 00:28:30,751
I will go home and sleep alone!!

600
00:28:30,901 --> 00:28:32,234
Wow you are so smart.

601
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,152
Right?

602
00:28:34,322 --> 00:28:35,789
Where is Manager Jung?

603
00:28:37,452 --> 00:28:38,585
Please be careful.

604
00:28:43,911 --> 00:28:45,178
Ahh mom, be careful.

605
00:28:47,582 --> 00:28:48,250
Oh Sister..

606
00:28:48,251 --> 00:28:49,671
We were just about to leave.

607
00:28:49,672 --> 00:28:50,501
Are you leaving?

608
00:28:50,502 --> 00:28:51,921
I forgot I have an appointment today.

609
00:28:51,922 --> 00:28:55,551
You know mom never misses to go
to the bath house on Saturdays.

610
00:28:55,552 --> 00:28:58,511
Mom always waited for this all week,
how could you forget...

611
00:28:58,512 --> 00:29:00,579
Just take mom to the bath house.

612
00:29:02,733 --> 00:29:05,533
Okay, I understand. I will take care of it.

613
00:29:10,193 --> 00:29:12,652
The number you have dialed
is temporarily unavailable.

614
00:29:12,653 --> 00:29:13,482
Please try sending a voicemail.

615
00:29:13,483 --> 00:29:14,483
Try once again.

616
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:16,314
Hello.

617
00:29:16,403 --> 00:29:19,018
Oh my God, this kid is so polite.

618
00:29:19,113 --> 00:29:20,113
Yes.

619
00:29:20,974 --> 00:29:21,974
Oh!

620
00:29:22,283 --> 00:29:23,622
Your house still don't have water right?

621
00:29:23,623 --> 00:29:24,623
Yes.

622
00:29:24,833 --> 00:29:27,566
We go on vacation when the water runs out.

623
00:29:27,583 --> 00:29:29,050
By going to the sauna!

624
00:29:31,793 --> 00:29:33,923
Vacation in sauna on today and tomorrow.

625
00:29:33,924 --> 00:29:35,347
Ahh I'm so happy.

626
00:29:35,554 --> 00:29:36,454
But.

627
00:29:36,464 --> 00:29:39,223
This building of ours is
really of poor quality.

628
00:29:39,224 --> 00:29:40,473
Why are you talking about that again.

629
00:29:40,474 --> 00:29:41,374
Why?

630
00:29:41,474 --> 00:29:42,474
Let's go!

631
00:29:43,144 --> 00:29:44,044
Oh yes.

632
00:29:44,104 --> 00:29:46,263
- Be careful
- Oh yes, the same.

633
00:29:46,264 --> 00:29:47,607
See you later.

634
00:29:49,934 --> 00:29:50,943
- Mom.
- Yes?

635
00:29:51,444 --> 00:29:53,403
Daddy doesn't answer the phone.

636
00:29:53,404 --> 00:29:55,613
How about I go back and get the trolley?

637
00:29:55,614 --> 00:29:56,403
Can you do it alone?

638
00:29:56,404 --> 00:29:57,404
Yes!

639
00:29:57,484 --> 00:30:00,144
My son is all grown up.

640
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,704
Go Go!

641
00:30:02,955 --> 00:30:04,043
Be careful.

642
00:30:04,285 --> 00:30:05,285
Yes.

643
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:21,385
Damn it!

644
00:30:22,555 --> 00:30:24,934
I'll be there after crossing the bridge.

645
00:30:24,935 --> 00:30:25,935
Okay, Okay.

646
00:30:26,515 --> 00:30:27,515
Yes.

647
00:30:27,645 --> 00:30:29,645
- Please drive faster.
- Yes!

648
00:30:30,275 --> 00:30:31,275
No.

649
00:30:32,316 --> 00:30:34,249
This is peak time for traffic.

650
00:30:35,866 --> 00:30:36,945
Ah today is Saturday?

651
00:30:36,946 --> 00:30:37,946
Saturday?

652
00:30:40,536 --> 00:30:42,021
Oh be careful!

653
00:30:44,496 --> 00:30:46,896
I'm hanging up,
I will arrive soon.

654
00:30:49,166 --> 00:30:50,166
Mister driver

655
00:30:51,006 --> 00:30:52,939
I'm sorry but I missed my bag.

656
00:30:53,126 --> 00:30:55,726
Can you stop and come around once more?

657
00:30:55,796 --> 00:30:56,965
I'll go up and come down again soon.

658
00:30:56,966 --> 00:30:57,966
Sorry

659
00:31:00,466 --> 00:31:01,466
I'll be back.

660
00:31:05,187 --> 00:31:06,187
Damn it!

661
00:31:19,027 --> 00:31:20,027
Damn it!

662
00:31:31,668 --> 00:31:33,401
Excuse me, is anyone home?

663
00:31:34,758 --> 00:31:36,691
Is there water in your house?

664
00:31:42,768 --> 00:31:44,235
No one is in the house.

665
00:31:56,238 --> 00:31:57,238
Eun-Joo.

666
00:31:59,818 --> 00:32:00,952
Eun-Joo, my bag..

667
00:32:03,579 --> 00:32:04,579
Eun-Joo.

668
00:32:05,579 --> 00:32:06,605
Hello.

669
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:08,383
Oh good.

670
00:32:10,749 --> 00:32:11,649
Su-Chan.

671
00:32:11,669 --> 00:32:12,569
Yes.

672
00:32:12,629 --> 00:32:16,362
If you see uncle 10 times a day,
would you still greet him?

673
00:32:16,929 --> 00:32:17,829
Yes!

674
00:32:17,929 --> 00:32:20,958
You are really a good boy and very polite.

675
00:32:21,389 --> 00:32:24,558
I knocked on your door but
your father didn't open it.

676
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,044
My dad is sleeping.

677
00:32:26,349 --> 00:32:28,848
Su-Chan, do you have water in your house?

678
00:32:28,849 --> 00:32:29,849
No.

679
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,642
No water.

680
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:48,832
Oh damn, who's smoking on the
roof of this building? Damn it!

681
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:55,777
Wait a minute, I have to check
if the water pump is working.

682
00:33:10,651 --> 00:33:11,651
Sorry

683
00:33:15,111 --> 00:33:16,280
I've thought about it.

684
00:33:16,281 --> 00:33:17,281
Make me crazy.

685
00:33:19,201 --> 00:33:20,201
Not much time.

686
00:33:31,002 --> 00:33:33,226
Hello Uncle

687
00:33:33,542 --> 00:33:35,711
I just wanted to ask, if there's
water running in your building?

688
00:33:35,712 --> 00:33:38,512
In our building there is no water.

689
00:33:41,882 --> 00:33:42,949
Oh there's water.

690
00:33:43,182 --> 00:33:44,471
- Ok ok.
- There's water!

691
00:33:44,472 --> 00:33:45,311
Yes yes.

692
00:33:45,312 --> 00:33:46,212
No problem.

693
00:33:46,312 --> 00:33:48,312
Okay, why are you spraying me?

694
00:33:51,037 --> 00:33:52,037
Watch out mom!

695
00:34:17,173 --> 00:34:18,173
Damn it!

696
00:34:40,534 --> 00:34:41,534
Help!

697
00:34:47,204 --> 00:34:49,031
Uncle call 119119!

698
00:34:59,215 --> 00:35:00,215
Mom.

699
00:35:12,435 --> 00:35:13,894
Uncle quickly call 119

700
00:35:13,895 --> 00:35:16,070
11... Call 119...

701
00:35:58,357 --> 00:35:59,357
Yeong-Yi!!

702
00:35:59,617 --> 00:36:00,617
Su-Chan?

703
00:36:01,487 --> 00:36:02,487
Su-Chan!!

704
00:36:51,378 --> 00:36:52,457
Where are you bastard?!

705
00:36:52,458 --> 00:36:54,858
Bingseu, listen to me carefully now!

706
00:36:55,208 --> 00:36:56,208
What? What?

707
00:36:56,668 --> 00:36:58,418
I'm afraid I can't go to the wedding today.

708
00:36:58,419 --> 00:37:00,086
- What did you say?
- I…

709
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:02,048
I'm sinking underground now.

710
00:37:02,049 --> 00:37:04,261
Just drown forever, bitch!!

711
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:06,532
I'm really drowning asshole!!

712
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:08,276
119 call 119.

713
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:13,959
Oh my God, What is this?

714
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,550
What is this?!!

715
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,270
Help.

716
00:38:02,491 --> 00:38:04,181
Please Taxi, let's go.

717
00:38:04,321 --> 00:38:06,254
Let's go home. Let's go home.

718
00:38:15,631 --> 00:38:17,098
Don't come any further.

719
00:38:18,801 --> 00:38:19,801
I beg you.

720
00:38:32,272 --> 00:38:33,272
What is this?

721
00:38:34,942 --> 00:38:36,875
How come there's a taxi here?

722
00:38:40,402 --> 00:38:41,837
Oh my chair!

723
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,539
Chief, please help me!

724
00:38:46,702 --> 00:38:47,702
Mr. Kim?

725
00:38:47,872 --> 00:38:49,121
What are you doing there?

726
00:38:49,122 --> 00:38:49,831
I do not know.

727
00:38:49,832 --> 00:38:51,565
Open the door, get me out!

728
00:38:54,962 --> 00:38:56,922
Damn taxi, why are you driving again?!

729
00:38:56,923 --> 00:38:57,922
Quick pull! pull firmly

730
00:38:57,923 --> 00:38:59,493
I beg you!!
Pull!!

731
00:39:00,133 --> 00:39:01,133
Pull hard.

732
00:39:04,263 --> 00:39:05,263
Mr Kim?!

733
00:39:05,513 --> 00:39:07,554
You bastard!!

734
00:39:08,053 --> 00:39:09,053
Mr Kim?!

735
00:39:09,393 --> 00:39:11,602
- What do I do?
- You killed me!!

736
00:39:11,603 --> 00:39:12,892
Mr. Kim, don't give up!

737
00:39:12,893 --> 00:39:14,160
Keep trying inside!

738
00:39:14,983 --> 00:39:15,983
I beg you!

739
00:39:22,153 --> 00:39:23,153
Mr. Kim!

740
00:39:24,203 --> 00:39:25,203
Mr. Kim!

741
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:27,864
Mr. Kim!

742
00:39:30,374 --> 00:39:31,374
This is bad!!

743
00:39:47,224 --> 00:39:48,691
Mr. Kim, come out.

744
00:39:59,155 --> 00:40:00,355
Thank you for real.

745
00:40:01,325 --> 00:40:02,325
Help me!

746
00:40:03,102 --> 00:40:04,102
Dear??

747
00:40:04,905 --> 00:40:05,905
Yeong-Yi.

748
00:40:09,325 --> 00:40:10,325
Chief!!?

749
00:40:11,535 --> 00:40:12,535
Dear??

750
00:40:15,295 --> 00:40:17,695
Seriously! Come on quickly pick up!!

751
00:40:20,215 --> 00:40:21,215
Eun-Joo??

752
00:40:22,595 --> 00:40:24,128
- Are you okay?
- Yes!

753
00:40:25,136 --> 00:40:26,736
Have you seen my family?

754
00:40:33,396 --> 00:40:35,395
How long will it take for the SAR
Team to carry out the rescue?

755
00:40:35,396 --> 00:40:37,063
It could take a long time.

756
00:40:37,106 --> 00:40:39,655
Please evacuate the citizens immediately
and check the situation of the victims.

757
00:40:39,656 --> 00:40:40,656
Yes I understand!

758
00:41:24,778 --> 00:41:27,041
Damn it!!

759
00:41:57,689 --> 00:41:59,365
It's done.. It worked.

760
00:42:03,409 --> 00:42:04,409
Su-Chan?!!

761
00:42:06,739 --> 00:42:07,639
We're here!

762
00:42:07,699 --> 00:42:09,032
I saw it I saw it...

763
00:42:10,959 --> 00:42:11,959
Su-Chan?

764
00:42:20,299 --> 00:42:21,299
Who are you?

765
00:42:21,759 --> 00:42:22,774
I saw it.

766
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:27,639
When I'm standing at the door at 502.

767
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,309
Su-Chan then left the house

768
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:32,293
I saw him take the elevator.

769
00:42:32,577 --> 00:42:34,035
Then I went to the rooftop.

770
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,913
This incident happened in
just a few minutes.

771
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,273
Su-Chan must be fine.

772
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:43,780
He will be fine

773
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:46,950
thank you

774
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,140
my god.

775
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:48,949
Ah ah.

776
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:49,950
It hurts.

777
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:51,370
Do not do it!

778
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:53,790
Seung-Tae?

779
00:42:53,961 --> 00:42:55,187
My child?

780
00:42:55,831 --> 00:42:56,831
Seung-Tae

781
00:42:57,001 --> 00:42:57,901
Seung-Tae!

782
00:42:57,903 --> 00:42:59,250
Where did Seung-Tae go?

783
00:42:59,251 --> 00:43:00,880
- Who is Seung-Tae?
- Seung-Tae!

784
00:43:00,881 --> 00:43:01,881
Seung-Tae!!

785
00:43:06,471 --> 00:43:07,007
Seung-Tae.

786
00:43:07,009 --> 00:43:08,081
This way!

787
00:43:10,851 --> 00:43:11,851
Seung-Tae

788
00:43:14,181 --> 00:43:15,181
Seung-Tae

789
00:43:18,401 --> 00:43:19,401
Seung-Tae.

790
00:43:26,992 --> 00:43:28,951
- Where are you?
- Seung-Tae!!

791
00:43:28,952 --> 00:43:29,952
Seung-Tae.

792
00:43:30,412 --> 00:43:31,412
Shoes!

793
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:33,612
Shoes!

794
00:43:34,332 --> 00:43:35,332
Shoes!!

795
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:36,251
Shoes!!

796
00:43:36,252 --> 00:43:37,001
Shoes?

797
00:43:37,002 --> 00:43:38,002
Shoes!!

798
00:43:39,212 --> 00:43:40,479
Shoes? Whose shoes?

799
00:43:40,712 --> 00:43:41,841
Look at the shoes!

800
00:43:41,842 --> 00:43:42,842
Shoes.

801
00:43:44,012 --> 00:43:45,212
Shoes aren't here!

802
00:43:51,432 --> 00:43:53,062
Shoes! What shoes do you mean?

803
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:54,352
My Seung-Tae's shoes.

804
00:43:54,353 --> 00:43:56,022
Not in the shoe closet right now.

805
00:43:56,023 --> 00:43:57,482
That means he went to the internet cafe

806
00:43:57,483 --> 00:43:58,902
Seung-Tae goes to the internet cafe??

807
00:43:58,903 --> 00:44:00,221
Means he's fine.

808
00:44:04,443 --> 00:44:05,742
It looks like one of that...

809
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:06,805
Sinkhole.

810
00:44:08,033 --> 00:44:10,500
My estimate is we're
around 500 meters down.

811
00:44:10,533 --> 00:44:12,702
Is it because of an earthquake or the war?

812
00:44:12,703 --> 00:44:13,603
I'm certain..

813
00:44:13,663 --> 00:44:14,663
It's a sinkhole.

814
00:44:14,753 --> 00:44:16,212
Eun-Joo, where are you going?

815
00:44:16,213 --> 00:44:18,332
Going to the top of the building,
maybe you can get a signal there.

816
00:44:18,333 --> 00:44:20,066
Or maybe you'll face death.

817
00:44:20,883 --> 00:44:21,843
Let's go together!

818
00:44:21,844 --> 00:44:24,191
Ahh.. I won't go.
It's too dangerous.

819
00:44:24,514 --> 00:44:27,173
Didn't you say the yellow
light means go on?

820
00:44:27,174 --> 00:44:28,582
This is a red light.

821
00:44:29,394 --> 00:44:30,496
Gotta stop.

822
00:44:31,554 --> 00:44:34,535
The foundation is unstable,
you have to be careful.

823
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:51,655
Danger! Avalanche!

824
00:45:00,215 --> 00:45:02,615
Everyone, quickly pull it quickly!!!

825
00:45:08,475 --> 00:45:10,275
Quickly! you are in danger!

826
00:45:12,395 --> 00:45:13,395
Climb!!

827
00:45:19,235 --> 00:45:20,834
Be Careful, It's dangerous.

828
00:45:22,316 --> 00:45:23,865
Don't... don't go through there.

829
00:45:23,866 --> 00:45:24,575
It's..

830
00:45:24,576 --> 00:45:26,022
Dangerous there.

831
00:45:27,078 --> 00:45:28,211
Why did you come?

832
00:45:28,536 --> 00:45:30,536
- I...
- Okay, you stay here!

833
00:45:30,616 --> 00:45:31,415
Thank you.

834
00:45:31,416 --> 00:45:32,785
Eun-Joo, you got a signal?

835
00:45:32,786 --> 00:45:33,944
No!

836
00:45:34,076 --> 00:45:35,245
- Keep looking!
- Yes.

837
00:45:35,246 --> 00:45:37,579
There must be a place with a signal.

838
00:45:40,876 --> 00:45:43,409
Have you ever seen anything like that?

839
00:45:44,966 --> 00:45:46,885
I've seen something like that.

840
00:45:46,886 --> 00:45:47,765
When?

841
00:45:47,766 --> 00:45:48,833
At 9 years old..

842
00:45:49,056 --> 00:45:51,042
I once fell into a well.

843
00:45:51,227 --> 00:45:52,127
Well?

844
00:45:52,227 --> 00:45:53,227
Yes!

845
00:45:55,607 --> 00:45:57,016
I crawled out by myself.

846
00:45:57,017 --> 00:45:58,355
Maybe with this too.

847
00:45:58,687 --> 00:45:59,941
Help!

848
00:46:00,937 --> 00:46:02,856
- There's people down here.
- Help!

849
00:46:02,857 --> 00:46:03,736
Help!

850
00:46:03,737 --> 00:46:05,865
- Hello!!
- Is there anyone?

851
00:46:05,867 --> 00:46:07,485
There are people here.

852
00:46:07,487 --> 00:46:08,387
Help!!

853
00:46:08,407 --> 00:46:09,747
Please save us!!

854
00:46:10,447 --> 00:46:13,051
Help!!

855
00:46:19,167 --> 00:46:23,736
Ouch... That's why I told you..

856
00:46:23,878 --> 00:46:26,517
To go home.

857
00:46:27,388 --> 00:46:29,455
Costs 80,000 but didn't want to go.

858
00:46:29,678 --> 00:46:30,811
What do you mean?

859
00:46:31,558 --> 00:46:32,987
Last night you know.

860
00:46:34,598 --> 00:46:37,187
I want to use my car to take
you and that woman home.

861
00:46:37,188 --> 00:46:39,397
Go to Anyang first then to Cheongun.

862
00:46:39,398 --> 00:46:42,187
It would be 90,000 then 80,000,
Didn't I tell you?

863
00:46:42,188 --> 00:46:44,524
Still says it's too expensive.

864
00:46:44,698 --> 00:46:46,298
Didn't even wanted to go.

865
00:46:46,778 --> 00:46:48,633
I did that?

866
00:46:49,908 --> 00:46:51,909
No, It was your chief Mr. Park.

867
00:46:52,249 --> 00:46:53,249
Me?

868
00:46:54,369 --> 00:46:55,636
You don't remember?

869
00:46:56,919 --> 00:46:58,530
You were so drunk.

870
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:00,733
Eighty thousand???

871
00:47:02,169 --> 00:47:03,468
Isn't that what you said?

872
00:47:03,469 --> 00:47:05,002
Did I say that Eun-Joo?

873
00:47:06,219 --> 00:47:07,119
Yes.

874
00:47:07,139 --> 00:47:08,139
Damn it!

875
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:20,564
Shut up, shut up!

876
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:25,037
- There are people here.
- His voice seems familiar.

877
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:25,739
Hello.

878
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:26,740
Help.

879
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,493
- Hey.
- Hey, isn't that Seung-Tae?

880
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:31,207
- Seung-Tae?
- Hello?

881
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,640
- Seung-Tae?
- Dad!!

882
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:34,480
I'm here.

883
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:35,580
Wait

884
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:40,840
Seung-Tae.

885
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,379
What is this? Was there an earthquake?

886
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:45,424
Sinkhole.

887
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:47,049
- Sinkhole?
- Yes.

888
00:47:49,931 --> 00:47:52,264
Didn't you go to the internet cafe?

889
00:47:52,391 --> 00:47:53,890
I've stopped going there.

890
00:47:53,891 --> 00:47:55,680
Then what were you doing on the roof?

891
00:47:55,681 --> 00:47:56,600
Getting some air.

892
00:47:56,601 --> 00:47:59,049
Why didn't you go to the cafe?

893
00:47:59,101 --> 00:48:00,560
Didn't dad tell me not to go?

894
00:48:00,561 --> 00:48:01,893
What's the matter..

895
00:48:02,231 --> 00:48:04,831
That you didn't go to the internet cafe.

896
00:48:05,111 --> 00:48:06,111
Why not go...

897
00:48:06,951 --> 00:48:08,471
Are you hurt? My son?

898
00:48:09,361 --> 00:48:10,387
Are you hurt?

899
00:48:13,871 --> 00:48:15,129
Oh damn.

900
00:48:15,331 --> 00:48:19,185
Then let's think about what
we should plan next.

901
00:48:19,462 --> 00:48:21,411
We are now in a disaster.

902
00:48:22,842 --> 00:48:25,171
First of all, we have to collect
supplies to survive.

903
00:48:25,172 --> 00:48:26,381
Drinking water, food.

904
00:48:26,382 --> 00:48:27,221
Drugs.

905
00:48:27,222 --> 00:48:28,444
And a clean bed.

906
00:48:29,222 --> 00:48:31,391
And we have to let the outside
know that we're still alive.

907
00:48:31,392 --> 00:48:33,851
We have to stand here and count one by one.

908
00:48:33,852 --> 00:48:35,351
If we find movement above.

909
00:48:35,352 --> 00:48:36,601
We send a signal with a flashlight.

910
00:48:36,602 --> 00:48:38,101
How can you understand
a situation like this?

911
00:48:38,102 --> 00:48:40,702
I learned from Brother Chris on YouTube.

912
00:48:45,232 --> 00:48:46,232
Really weird.

913
00:48:46,362 --> 00:48:47,191
What is it?

914
00:48:47,192 --> 00:48:49,126
He shouldn't know any brother.

915
00:48:49,783 --> 00:48:51,532
I don't think he goes to the
internet cafe all day.

916
00:48:51,533 --> 00:48:54,333
He's at home and just surfing the internet.

917
00:48:55,163 --> 00:48:56,630
Maybe a foreign friend.

918
00:48:58,373 --> 00:49:01,542
He can't speak English,
where are foreign friends from?

919
00:49:01,543 --> 00:49:03,143
We better find a way out.

920
00:49:07,343 --> 00:49:09,512
It is currently very dangerous
near the scene.

921
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:11,762
It's hard for us to verify the
situation inside the sinkhole.

922
00:49:11,763 --> 00:49:13,682
But later after evacuating the citizens.

923
00:49:13,683 --> 00:49:15,852
We will try to enter the sinkhole.

924
00:49:15,853 --> 00:49:17,453
Please everyone trust us.

925
00:49:17,643 --> 00:49:19,311
Please be patient waiting.

926
00:49:20,354 --> 00:49:22,087
Please take care of it sir.

927
00:49:23,024 --> 00:49:24,557
Ok we will try our best.

928
00:49:27,484 --> 00:49:31,073
Then let's check the list of family
members buried in the ground.

929
00:49:31,074 --> 00:49:32,841
Please say one by one

930
00:49:33,124 --> 00:49:35,653
Lee Seung-Hoon is 10 years old.

931
00:49:35,874 --> 00:49:36,874
This is No. 202

932
00:49:37,544 --> 00:49:38,544
501

933
00:49:39,374 --> 00:49:42,031
Park Dong-Won is 37 years old...

934
00:49:59,275 --> 00:50:00,483
I'm sorry Mr. Kim.

935
00:50:04,195 --> 00:50:05,662
Eun-Joo too, I'm sorry.

936
00:50:12,245 --> 00:50:14,947
I shouldn't have asked you to
come to the house warming.

937
00:50:16,285 --> 00:50:19,300
I never thought I would die in
your house ever in my life.

938
00:50:20,046 --> 00:50:21,925
What's wrong with you thinking about dying?

939
00:50:22,336 --> 00:50:25,635
I have struggled for 11 years to buy this house
and it became like this in just 2 weeks.

940
00:50:25,636 --> 00:50:28,805
Even I don't want to die,
So don't even think about dying

941
00:50:28,806 --> 00:50:30,739
I really didn't want to think.

942
00:50:34,056 --> 00:50:36,053
But there's these images of
death in my mind.

943
00:50:37,106 --> 00:50:38,725
You should think about Hyo-Jeong.

944
00:50:38,726 --> 00:50:39,854
You like that, don't you?

945
00:50:41,816 --> 00:50:43,260
What's the point of liking her?

946
00:50:44,526 --> 00:50:45,855
Isn't she currently dating Jung?

947
00:50:45,856 --> 00:50:48,156
It's not like they're getting married.

948
00:50:48,157 --> 00:50:50,116
Better to just confess
if you come out later.

949
00:50:50,117 --> 00:50:52,467
Didn't you also hear that Mr. Jung
had bought an apartment?

950
00:50:53,907 --> 00:50:55,076
While I live in one room.

951
00:50:55,077 --> 00:50:56,344
Really incomparable.

952
00:50:56,917 --> 00:50:58,706
Hey, can't you also buy an apartment?

953
00:50:58,707 --> 00:51:01,047
Didn't everyone say it was
valued at 200 million?

954
00:51:04,717 --> 00:51:06,697
I really don't want to repeat
I..

955
00:51:07,257 --> 00:51:09,257
I'm really thinking of dying!!

956
00:51:12,637 --> 00:51:14,170
I also live in one room.

957
00:51:14,887 --> 00:51:17,755
So who lives in one room can't get married?

958
00:51:18,018 --> 00:51:19,187
One room can be two rooms.

959
00:51:19,188 --> 00:51:21,034
Two rooms can also be three rooms.

960
00:51:21,938 --> 00:51:23,805
Of course, Eun-Joo is right.

961
00:51:23,858 --> 00:51:25,237
Look at me, I used to live in one room.

962
00:51:25,238 --> 00:51:26,407
Isn't it three rooms now?

963
00:51:26,408 --> 00:51:28,884
Didn't you say you've been fighting
for 11 years? 11 years…!

964
00:51:29,948 --> 00:51:32,481
In addition to the 3 rooms, you now...

965
00:51:45,468 --> 00:51:46,468
Hey Seung-Tae

966
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:47,679
Seung-Tae.

967
00:51:48,299 --> 00:51:49,388
What are you doing?

968
00:51:49,389 --> 00:51:50,428
I'm looking for something.

969
00:51:50,429 --> 00:51:51,888
Let's get out soon, something's falling.

970
00:51:51,889 --> 00:51:52,758
Quickly!

971
00:51:52,759 --> 00:51:53,759
Okay I'll come.

972
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:17,660
Damn it!

973
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,200
Damn, look at this.

974
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,290
What is this.

975
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:30,603
EVACUATION BUS FOR THE VICTIMS' FAMILY

976
00:53:15,061 --> 00:53:16,641
Why didn't the Rescue Team people come?

977
00:53:16,642 --> 00:53:18,061
Can't believe a day has passed.

978
00:53:18,062 --> 00:53:19,995
Not even one has shown up yet.

979
00:53:21,562 --> 00:53:23,231
They should know that we are still alive.

980
00:53:23,232 --> 00:53:24,499
Of course they know.

981
00:53:25,152 --> 00:53:27,752
Please calm down and be patient waiting.

982
00:53:28,992 --> 00:53:30,259
Discard the expired.

983
00:53:32,282 --> 00:53:34,911
Does it matter now about
the expiration date?

984
00:53:34,912 --> 00:53:36,454
Mr. Kim, you are so sensitive.

985
00:53:36,992 --> 00:53:38,931
I will have diarrhea if I eat expired food.

986
00:53:41,712 --> 00:53:43,379
Around 10:50 this morning

987
00:53:43,382 --> 00:53:45,288
in Changsin-dong, of Seoul.

988
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:48,512
The phenomenon of underlying caves
collapse, Namely a sinkhole occurred.

989
00:53:48,513 --> 00:53:52,682
So far, the accident has caused a building
to collapse to the bottom of the sinkhole.

990
00:53:52,683 --> 00:53:55,602
The cause of the incident was the
subsidence of the foundation.

991
00:53:55,603 --> 00:53:57,270
Thus causing ground shear.

992
00:53:57,563 --> 00:54:00,206
The newly completed building, collapsed.

993
00:54:00,933 --> 00:54:03,800
We are currently investigating the disaster

994
00:54:04,403 --> 00:54:06,062
32 people were slightly injured

995
00:54:06,063 --> 00:54:07,330
7 seriously injured.

996
00:54:07,573 --> 00:54:12,373
The injured are currently being taken to 11
hospitals including Yonsei University Hospital...

997
00:54:24,714 --> 00:54:27,750
What I'm afraid of down there is
what if they can't eat anything.

998
00:54:33,134 --> 00:54:34,134
What's this?

999
00:54:58,745 --> 00:55:00,224
Roast turkey!

1000
00:55:03,665 --> 00:55:04,665
Let's eat.

1001
00:55:06,635 --> 00:55:08,568
Hey number 501, wait a minute.

1002
00:55:12,465 --> 00:55:13,465
Eat!

1003
00:55:13,925 --> 00:55:14,925
Eat.

1004
00:55:17,516 --> 00:55:18,983
Here you go number 501.

1005
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:21,066
Eat.

1006
00:55:26,526 --> 00:55:27,526
Let's eat.

1007
00:55:37,496 --> 00:55:39,416
Isn't that the new rocking
chair that you bought?

1008
00:55:41,376 --> 00:55:42,376
Yes.

1009
00:55:43,586 --> 00:55:46,421
I always thought I should buy good
furniture when I have my own house.

1010
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:51,249
To not use the type of furniture that
is damaged by moving around.

1011
00:55:52,058 --> 00:55:55,098
I've always wanted a piece of furniture
that can be passed on to my children.

1012
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:56,960
You can buy it again later.

1013
00:55:57,517 --> 00:55:58,984
But now I have no home.

1014
00:56:01,397 --> 00:56:03,123
The rain doesn't stop.

1015
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:05,670
It keeps raining.

1016
00:56:10,407 --> 00:56:12,373
Hey, don't worry.

1017
00:56:12,527 --> 00:56:13,861
Wait a little longer

1018
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:15,358
119 is coming.

1019
00:56:19,838 --> 00:56:21,468
Mr. Kim is not married yet, right?

1020
00:56:22,708 --> 00:56:23,708
Yes.

1021
00:56:23,918 --> 00:56:24,918
Don't do it.

1022
00:56:26,458 --> 00:56:27,725
I can't get married.

1023
00:56:28,588 --> 00:56:29,877
I don't have a house.

1024
00:56:29,878 --> 00:56:31,078
And have no future.

1025
00:56:31,968 --> 00:56:34,463
Mr. Park, I envied you when
you bought a house.

1026
00:56:35,718 --> 00:56:36,718
Did you buy it?

1027
00:56:37,228 --> 00:56:38,557
You bought this house?

1028
00:56:38,558 --> 00:56:39,387
Yes.

1029
00:56:39,388 --> 00:56:40,588
What is the price?

1030
00:56:41,188 --> 00:56:42,254
390 million.

1031
00:56:43,979 --> 00:56:45,591
It didn't take that long to go up.

1032
00:56:47,819 --> 00:56:49,398
How much did you buy yours for?

1033
00:56:50,279 --> 00:56:51,328
I only rent.

1034
00:56:51,569 --> 00:56:53,429
Deposit 30 million and rent
800,000 per month.

1035
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:56,968
Oh it's so cold.

1036
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:58,657
Where is firewood?

1037
00:56:58,659 --> 00:56:59,618
Ah there is a lot of
firewood here.

1038
00:56:59,619 --> 00:57:01,498
Hey you guys, let's pull the wood out.

1039
00:57:01,499 --> 00:57:03,418
There's a lot of firewood here.

1040
00:57:03,419 --> 00:57:04,419
Come on.

1041
00:57:04,669 --> 00:57:06,378
Use this broken chair, let me destroy it.

1042
00:57:06,379 --> 00:57:07,258
To be used as firewood.

1043
00:57:07,259 --> 00:57:08,326
Come on, quickly.

1044
00:57:09,219 --> 00:57:11,341
Oh so much.

1045
00:57:12,049 --> 00:57:13,517
Why is this so strong?

1046
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:17,343
Why can't I destroy it?

1047
00:58:04,311 --> 00:58:05,520
What is wrong with it?

1048
00:58:05,521 --> 00:58:07,121
Maybe the signal is weak.

1049
00:58:08,691 --> 00:58:10,091
This is a big problem

1050
00:58:26,795 --> 00:58:28,097
119

1051
00:58:28,462 --> 00:58:29,131
Dad!

1052
00:58:29,132 --> 00:58:30,132
119 here.

1053
00:58:32,132 --> 00:58:33,132
Daddy 119

1054
00:58:33,472 --> 00:58:34,372
119 here

1055
00:58:34,432 --> 00:58:35,432
119?

1056
00:58:37,352 --> 00:58:38,619
Hey 119 is here 119.

1057
00:58:39,512 --> 00:58:40,221
Come out fast.

1058
00:58:40,222 --> 00:58:41,222
Team 119

1059
00:58:41,432 --> 00:58:42,433
119 is here 119

1060
00:58:45,023 --> 00:58:46,023
119

1061
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,081
Where's 119?

1062
00:58:48,313 --> 00:58:48,902
Here!

1063
00:58:48,903 --> 00:58:49,903
Here.

1064
00:58:50,823 --> 00:58:51,692
Where?

1065
00:58:51,693 --> 00:58:52,862
Where? Where? Where?

1066
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:53,863
Is this 119?

1067
00:58:53,993 --> 00:58:54,992
It says 119 on it

1068
00:58:54,993 --> 00:58:55,782
119119

1069
00:58:55,783 --> 00:58:56,412
We are saved!

1070
00:58:56,413 --> 00:58:57,413
Saved!!

1071
00:58:57,573 --> 00:58:58,702
It fell from above.

1072
00:58:58,703 --> 00:59:00,162
The signal in this place must
be relatively weak.

1073
00:59:00,163 --> 00:59:01,443
Can't be perfect.

1074
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:04,211
Ahh isn't there a big hole up there.

1075
00:59:04,213 --> 00:59:05,582
Why is there no signal?

1076
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:07,962
When we are in tunnels and mountains,
sometimes there is no signal.

1077
00:59:07,963 --> 00:59:09,632
We are at 250 meters from the ground above.

1078
00:59:09,633 --> 00:59:10,672
Of course there will be no signal.

1079
00:59:10,673 --> 00:59:12,053
Can the camera still be used?

1080
00:59:12,054 --> 00:59:13,934
Everyone, help us.

1081
00:59:14,014 --> 00:59:15,932
We're stuck here.

1082
00:59:15,934 --> 00:59:17,343
My name is Kim Seung-Hyeon.

1083
00:59:17,344 --> 00:59:18,643
- Come help us
- Help me!

1084
00:59:18,644 --> 00:59:19,544
We're here…

1085
00:59:19,604 --> 00:59:20,433
Is that yours?

1086
00:59:20,434 --> 00:59:21,223
You don't need to know.

1087
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,353
Why so much money?

1088
00:59:22,354 --> 00:59:23,354
Watch out!!

1089
00:59:30,364 --> 00:59:31,264
Go there.

1090
00:59:31,274 --> 00:59:32,274
Quick.

1091
00:59:34,574 --> 00:59:35,774
Come here quickly!

1092
00:59:43,165 --> 00:59:43,914
Go there.

1093
00:59:43,915 --> 00:59:44,982
Over here.

1094
00:59:57,725 --> 00:59:58,725
Mr. Kim!

1095
01:00:07,275 --> 01:00:08,275
Mr. Kim!

1096
01:00:10,065 --> 01:00:11,065
Help me.

1097
01:00:11,616 --> 01:00:12,275
Where?

1098
01:00:12,276 --> 01:00:13,276
Mr. Kim!

1099
01:00:21,536 --> 01:00:22,415
Don't go, don't...

1100
01:00:22,416 --> 01:00:23,683
Eun-Ju, don't go...

1101
01:00:42,857 --> 01:00:44,258
Eun-Joo, don't dodge the rocks!

1102
01:01:00,117 --> 01:01:01,117
Catch!!

1103
01:01:15,468 --> 01:01:17,252
Mr. Park please help me pull the rope!!

1104
01:01:20,308 --> 01:01:20,937
Mister!

1105
01:01:20,938 --> 01:01:21,938
Help me.

1106
01:01:36,238 --> 01:01:37,947
Chief, please pull the rope.

1107
01:01:37,948 --> 01:01:38,948
Help! help.

1108
01:01:42,039 --> 01:01:43,039
Help me.

1109
01:01:48,249 --> 01:01:49,249
Mr. Kim!

1110
01:01:49,517 --> 01:01:50,598
I'm coming.

1111
01:01:51,259 --> 01:01:52,324
Wait a bit.

1112
01:01:52,469 --> 01:01:55,469
There's nothing to wait
for you bastards...!!

1113
01:01:55,759 --> 01:01:56,759
Pull strongly.

1114
01:01:59,309 --> 01:02:00,309
Keep pulling.

1115
01:02:00,769 --> 01:02:02,598
It must be pulled at the same time.

1116
01:02:02,599 --> 01:02:03,599
Pull.

1117
01:02:03,979 --> 01:02:04,979
Same time.

1118
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:13,224
Keep going!

1119
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:20,277
Help! help.

1120
01:03:17,762 --> 01:03:18,762
It hurts.

1121
01:03:19,012 --> 01:03:20,462
My feet...

1122
01:03:21,722 --> 01:03:23,122
Eun-Joo, hold tightly.

1123
01:03:40,493 --> 01:03:41,493
Dad!!

1124
01:03:42,123 --> 01:03:43,412
It's okay, dad is fine.

1125
01:03:43,413 --> 01:03:44,413
Dad!

1126
01:03:46,113 --> 01:03:47,113
Do not move!

1127
01:03:47,213 --> 01:03:48,213
Don't drown.

1128
01:03:48,503 --> 01:03:49,252
Dad.

1129
01:03:49,253 --> 01:03:50,672
It's okay, dad is fine.

1130
01:03:50,673 --> 01:03:51,673
Its okay.

1131
01:03:53,003 --> 01:03:54,820
- Dad!
- Do not!

1132
01:03:55,173 --> 01:03:56,173
Dad.

1133
01:04:00,643 --> 01:04:01,643
Dad

1134
01:04:02,965 --> 01:04:04,232
Seung-Tae, let go!!

1135
01:04:18,154 --> 01:04:19,154
Seung-Tae

1136
01:04:20,914 --> 01:04:21,914
Seung-Tae.

1137
01:04:23,454 --> 01:04:24,894
- Look at me!!
- Dad.

1138
01:04:24,954 --> 01:04:25,954
Brother!!

1139
01:04:30,294 --> 01:04:31,294
Keep standing.

1140
01:04:31,424 --> 01:04:32,755
Raise your head

1141
01:04:32,924 --> 01:04:34,657
Seung-Tae raise your head!

1142
01:04:37,765 --> 01:04:39,248
Oh my son

1143
01:04:40,135 --> 01:04:42,506
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1144
01:04:44,605 --> 01:04:45,634
Dad.

1145
01:04:47,395 --> 01:04:48,395
Dad.

1146
01:04:50,605 --> 01:04:51,605
Dad.

1147
01:04:59,865 --> 01:05:01,089
Dad, Dad.

1148
01:05:04,257 --> 01:05:05,257
Follow me!!

1149
01:05:17,346 --> 01:05:18,346
Brother!!

1150
01:05:20,476 --> 01:05:21,476
Seung-Tae!!

1151
01:05:28,896 --> 01:05:29,963
Are you alright?

1152
01:05:32,066 --> 01:05:33,066
Wake up!!

1153
01:05:35,406 --> 01:05:36,275
Get up!!

1154
01:05:36,276 --> 01:05:37,877
Seung-Tae, are you okay?

1155
01:05:40,907 --> 01:05:41,807
Wake up!!

1156
01:05:41,809 --> 01:05:42,809
Seung-Tae

1157
01:05:46,337 --> 01:05:48,029
Seung-Tae where is he?

1158
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:49,031
Seung-Tae...

1159
01:05:49,917 --> 01:05:51,836
Seung-Tae wake up, Seung-Tae wake up!!

1160
01:05:51,837 --> 01:05:52,836
Seung-Tae wake up!

1161
01:05:52,837 --> 01:05:54,037
Are you all right?

1162
01:05:54,137 --> 01:05:55,137
Seung-Tae!!

1163
01:05:55,178 --> 01:05:56,378
Seung-Tae wake up!

1164
01:05:57,257 --> 01:05:58,257
Are you okay?

1165
01:06:12,738 --> 01:06:14,357
We are temporarily securing
the building with chains.

1166
01:06:14,358 --> 01:06:16,438
But the probability of collapsing
is still very high.

1167
01:06:19,078 --> 01:06:20,478
Isn't that our drone?

1168
01:06:22,958 --> 01:06:24,026
Let's get it!

1169
01:06:37,639 --> 01:06:38,848
He's an employee of my husband's company

1170
01:06:38,849 --> 01:06:40,902
Hong Eun-Joo, Kim Seong-Hoon.

1171
01:06:49,729 --> 01:06:51,315
Why is my Seong-hun not there?

1172
01:06:53,439 --> 01:06:54,439
That is it.

1173
01:06:56,779 --> 01:06:58,379
How about my Seong-Hoon?

1174
01:06:58,449 --> 01:06:59,449
I'm sorry.

1175
01:07:00,029 --> 01:07:01,296
This is all we have

1176
01:07:02,199 --> 01:07:03,555
Seung-Hoon...

1177
01:07:04,909 --> 01:07:05,909
No!!

1178
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:08,040
Mr. Seo.

1179
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:13,438
My husband and Su-Chan
don't seem to be together.

1180
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:16,173
Please look for them.

1181
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:22,183
You said Su-Chan was holding
your phone, right?

1182
01:07:22,810 --> 01:07:23,810
Yes.

1183
01:07:26,690 --> 01:07:28,490
What are people living for?

1184
01:07:30,190 --> 01:07:31,990
I'm just busy with the shop.

1185
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:35,633
Can't even give my Seong-Hoon..

1186
01:07:36,241 --> 01:07:38,306
Hot food every day.

1187
01:07:45,331 --> 01:07:46,598
What's my life for?

1188
01:07:51,881 --> 01:07:53,681
If Seung-Hoon can be saved,

1189
01:07:55,591 --> 01:07:57,975
I will close the shop

1190
01:07:59,971 --> 01:08:02,890
and will always be by his side.

1191
01:08:05,392 --> 01:08:07,547
I have to do that.

1192
01:08:24,492 --> 01:08:26,759
We've tracked the phone's location.

1193
01:08:28,332 --> 01:08:29,668
Su-Chan's phone...

1194
01:08:30,882 --> 01:08:32,415
The last location was..

1195
01:08:36,133 --> 01:08:37,865
At the residency building.

1196
01:08:46,063 --> 01:08:47,530
How could this happen?

1197
01:08:51,523 --> 01:08:52,402
How could that be?

1198
01:08:52,403 --> 01:08:53,403
Good grief.

1199
01:08:56,573 --> 01:08:57,573
But…

1200
01:08:59,653 --> 01:09:02,283
This sinkhole disaster still
has its benefits.

1201
01:09:03,373 --> 01:09:04,373
What?

1202
01:09:05,704 --> 01:09:08,417
It's rare to see Seung-Tae sleeping
at my house like that.

1203
01:09:12,214 --> 01:09:13,214
Thank you 501.

1204
01:09:18,344 --> 01:09:20,973
I will repay for this in the future.

1205
01:09:20,974 --> 01:09:24,241
At least you should come out
alive to repay later

1206
01:09:24,974 --> 01:09:28,813
119 sending drones explains what?
They know what's going on.

1207
01:09:28,814 --> 01:09:31,614
They know we're stuck here without nothing.

1208
01:09:32,604 --> 01:09:35,524
By the way, are the people living
in this building all right?

1209
01:09:35,525 --> 01:09:36,525
Do not worry

1210
01:09:36,905 --> 01:09:39,058
I've been around in the morning.

1211
01:09:39,445 --> 01:09:41,178
Maybe due to lack of water.

1212
01:09:41,205 --> 01:09:43,363
There's was no one at any home.

1213
01:09:43,365 --> 01:09:44,365
Really?

1214
01:09:46,835 --> 01:09:47,902
That's really good.

1215
01:09:49,045 --> 01:09:50,980
I was worried about them.

1216
01:10:02,475 --> 01:10:03,808
Is that your mother?

1217
01:10:13,276 --> 01:10:16,365
Eun-Joo, did you have any
difficulties at the company?

1218
01:10:16,366 --> 01:10:17,735
Let me know if any.

1219
01:10:18,156 --> 01:10:19,156
Is that so?

1220
01:10:23,536 --> 01:10:27,269
Doesn't the company send gifts
home during the holidays?

1221
01:10:27,536 --> 01:10:29,603
I want to send it to my parents

1222
01:10:30,456 --> 01:10:32,589
I've never sent them to this day.

1223
01:10:36,427 --> 01:10:37,503
I will try...

1224
01:10:48,657 --> 01:10:54,256
Do you want to listen to
music or take a selfie?

1225
01:10:54,997 --> 01:10:56,264
Let's take a selfie.

1226
01:11:19,038 --> 01:11:20,466
This news just in.

1227
01:11:20,468 --> 01:11:24,601
It has been confirmed that there
are survivors in the sinkhole.

1228
01:11:24,728 --> 01:11:28,347
Meanwhile the local rescue operation
confirmed that there were more survivors.

1229
01:11:28,348 --> 01:11:31,590
Also doing their best to seek and save.

1230
01:11:31,648 --> 01:11:33,648
But there is danger of a
next possible collapse.

1231
01:11:33,649 --> 01:11:35,358
And it is expected that there
will be heavy rain tonight.

1232
01:11:35,359 --> 01:11:39,118
Will increase the difficulty
of search and rescue.

1233
01:11:39,239 --> 01:11:42,680
Now we know there are
survivors in the sinkhole.

1234
01:11:42,829 --> 01:11:44,788
But if another standing building
comes crashing down.

1235
01:11:44,789 --> 01:11:46,578
Then something big will happen.

1236
01:11:46,579 --> 01:11:48,316
How can you say that?

1237
01:11:48,499 --> 01:11:51,996
Who would agree to blow up a nice building?

1238
01:11:52,039 --> 01:11:54,894
Again, we won't blow it up.

1239
01:11:55,525 --> 01:11:58,254
The concrete collapse below.

1240
01:11:58,299 --> 01:12:00,968
It then moves the center of gravity in the
opposite direction from the sinkhole.

1241
01:12:00,969 --> 01:12:04,889
If we don't do this, your homes will
all sink into the sinkhole.

1242
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:06,269
Do you want to save only them?

1243
01:12:06,270 --> 01:12:07,270
How about us?

1244
01:12:07,310 --> 01:12:08,781
We have to live too.

1245
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:10,024
Is it right??

1246
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:11,149
Of course.

1247
01:12:11,810 --> 01:12:13,410
If we continue like this.

1248
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:15,649
We will never reach an agreement.

1249
01:12:15,650 --> 01:12:16,399
Right?

1250
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,105
Of course I don't agree.

1251
01:12:18,107 --> 01:12:19,107
Do not agree…

1252
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:26,243
There is no way to agree.

1253
01:12:26,245 --> 01:12:28,743
Let me say something.

1254
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:33,920
I saw someone on the roof of that building.

1255
01:12:33,921 --> 01:12:37,321
He was looking at me all throguhout
when it happend.

1256
01:12:37,671 --> 01:12:39,472
When I looked at him

1257
01:12:39,551 --> 01:12:41,550
I was going crazy.

1258
01:12:42,221 --> 01:12:46,347
It took me 20 years to buy this house.

1259
01:12:48,271 --> 01:12:51,733
But... if now I don't agree.

1260
01:12:52,771 --> 01:12:54,932
I will definitely be cursed.

1261
01:12:55,981 --> 01:12:57,331
I agree sir.

1262
01:13:08,202 --> 01:13:09,831
Are the satellite phones
and rescue items ready?

1263
01:13:09,832 --> 01:13:12,045
We're still looking for a parachute
It takes time sir.

1264
01:13:12,082 --> 01:13:13,541
Hey, it's going to rain soon.

1265
01:13:13,542 --> 01:13:14,542
Be quick.

1266
01:13:14,592 --> 01:13:15,592
Yes sir!!

1267
01:13:23,892 --> 01:13:24,892
Lower.

1268
01:13:48,453 --> 01:13:50,520
Take it, son, isn't this yours?

1269
01:13:50,793 --> 01:13:52,326
Can't even go to school.

1270
01:13:53,083 --> 01:13:55,186
Although earn so much without buying books.

1271
01:13:56,213 --> 01:13:57,295
Take it.

1272
01:14:01,634 --> 01:14:02,634
Hey Seung-Tae.

1273
01:14:03,434 --> 01:14:04,967
Can I ask me something?

1274
01:14:05,514 --> 01:14:06,514
Yes.

1275
01:14:06,724 --> 01:14:08,483
What are you saving that money for?

1276
01:14:09,854 --> 01:14:11,874
My dream is to have a hundred million won.

1277
01:14:12,604 --> 01:14:14,780
Your dream? 100 million won?

1278
01:14:15,274 --> 01:14:15,943
Yes.

1279
01:14:15,944 --> 01:14:17,664
If you got it? What do you want to do next?

1280
01:14:19,194 --> 01:14:20,094
I do not know.

1281
01:14:20,217 --> 01:14:21,217
Ahh this kid.

1282
01:14:22,244 --> 01:14:23,825
So boring oh my god.

1283
01:14:26,534 --> 01:14:27,534
Hey Seung-Tae

1284
01:14:28,244 --> 01:14:29,244
look at that.

1285
01:14:31,585 --> 01:14:34,998
That dream... is like that star.

1286
01:14:35,795 --> 01:14:37,952
Very far away.

1287
01:14:39,295 --> 01:14:42,726
Dad, it seems to be getting closer.

1288
01:14:44,385 --> 01:14:45,514
What do you mean close?

1289
01:14:45,515 --> 01:14:47,115
Are you drunk right now?

1290
01:14:48,019 --> 01:14:49,019
What's this?

1291
01:14:49,439 --> 01:14:51,773
What's this? Is it a shooting star?

1292
01:14:52,855 --> 01:14:54,821
We are saved, we are saved.

1293
01:14:55,695 --> 01:14:58,295
It is now clear that 119 is coming soon

1294
01:14:58,905 --> 01:14:59,905
thank you Lord.

1295
01:15:20,256 --> 01:15:21,923
Ahh the water is so sweet.

1296
01:15:22,096 --> 01:15:22,715
What's this?

1297
01:15:22,716 --> 01:15:24,175
Isn't this a satellite phone?

1298
01:15:24,176 --> 01:15:25,243
There's a signal.

1299
01:15:26,556 --> 01:15:27,556
Can we call?

1300
01:15:34,567 --> 01:15:35,567
Mom!!

1301
01:15:36,737 --> 01:15:38,291
Mom.

1302
01:15:38,947 --> 01:15:41,017
Why wasn't that my mom?

1303
01:15:41,367 --> 01:15:42,367
How come.

1304
01:15:43,237 --> 01:15:44,307
Not your mother?

1305
01:15:44,577 --> 01:15:45,721
It was a man speaking.

1306
01:15:46,497 --> 01:15:48,479
Eun-Joo, try calling home.

1307
01:15:50,497 --> 01:15:51,589
It's alright.

1308
01:15:51,787 --> 01:15:53,746
They will worry even more if I call now.

1309
01:15:53,747 --> 01:15:55,409
Can make them sadder

1310
01:15:56,759 --> 01:15:58,959
I'll go up and meet them directly.

1311
01:16:10,438 --> 01:16:11,438
Seo-Jeon.

1312
01:16:12,398 --> 01:16:16,035
Um, It's me Manager Kim and
Eun-Joo, we're doing well.

1313
01:16:16,037 --> 01:16:17,513
Thank you for worrying about me.

1314
01:16:17,778 --> 01:16:19,748
Seo-Jeon, I want to tell you something.

1315
01:16:22,568 --> 01:16:24,781
We have that gift event for
Chuseok next month.

1316
01:16:25,988 --> 01:16:27,810
Add Eun-Joos' name for that too.

1317
01:16:30,119 --> 01:16:32,208
Can it be something like ribs?
Korean beef...

1318
01:16:32,209 --> 01:16:33,744
Don't forget to print the company name

1319
01:16:34,249 --> 01:16:35,249
thank you.

1320
01:16:41,653 --> 01:16:42,989
Here 501.

1321
01:16:43,219 --> 01:16:45,152
Call Su-Chan's mother quickly.

1322
01:16:48,729 --> 01:16:49,428
What is it?

1323
01:16:49,429 --> 01:16:51,518
- Quick answer, answer!
- What's this?

1324
01:16:51,519 --> 01:16:51,911
Hello.

1325
01:16:51,913 --> 01:16:54,360
This is from the search and rescue
center can you hear us?

1326
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:56,700
Thank you.

1327
01:16:57,229 --> 01:16:59,163
Yes, my name is Park Dong-Won.

1328
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:01,149
There's five of us who survived.

1329
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:02,239
Is everyone safe?

1330
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:03,159
Has anyone been hurt?

1331
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,692
Yes... everyone is fine.

1332
01:17:06,349 --> 01:17:07,684
I have to go in.

1333
01:17:08,450 --> 01:17:09,499
I have to save my son.

1334
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:10,459
Park Dong-Won's wife!

1335
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:11,249
We will arrive in an hour.

1336
01:17:11,250 --> 01:17:12,579
No, in less than 30 minutes down there.

1337
01:17:12,580 --> 01:17:14,113
Su-Chan is down there!!

1338
01:17:16,710 --> 01:17:17,710
Yeong-Yi??

1339
01:17:19,550 --> 01:17:21,469
Didn't Su-Chan go to the
supermarket with you?

1340
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,783
Su-Chan took my phone.

1341
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:26,502
The last location was in that building.

1342
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:29,214
Dear, Su-Chan is down there.

1343
01:17:31,061 --> 01:17:34,310
You said you saw my son Su-Chan get
on the elevator and get out, right?

1344
01:17:34,311 --> 01:17:36,778
Yes, right! Is there something wrong?

1345
01:17:36,901 --> 01:17:38,820
- My child is missing.
- What?

1346
01:17:38,821 --> 01:17:40,354
He didn't go to his mom.

1347
01:17:40,531 --> 01:17:41,910
What are you saying?

1348
01:17:42,201 --> 01:17:44,520
I... I saw it clearly.

1349
01:17:44,611 --> 01:17:46,200
Park Dong-Won! Park Dong-won!!

1350
01:17:46,201 --> 01:17:47,490
You have to find your son.

1351
01:17:47,491 --> 01:17:49,558
You have do it before the flood.

1352
01:17:58,211 --> 01:17:59,211
Mom.

1353
01:18:28,453 --> 01:18:29,453
Chief.

1354
01:18:31,833 --> 01:18:32,833
Be careful.

1355
01:18:39,003 --> 01:18:40,003
Slowly.

1356
01:18:40,303 --> 01:18:41,303
Hang tight.

1357
01:18:42,343 --> 01:18:43,343
Slowly.

1358
01:18:51,223 --> 01:18:53,377
Are you all right Mr. 501?

1359
01:18:55,233 --> 01:18:56,233
Yes.

1360
01:18:56,693 --> 01:18:59,942
There's a cover on top of it.

1361
01:18:59,944 --> 01:19:00,944
Open it.

1362
01:19:04,864 --> 01:19:05,864
Did you see it?

1363
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:07,074
Yes!

1364
01:19:30,605 --> 01:19:31,605
Lower.

1365
01:19:49,325 --> 01:19:50,204
It's collapsing!

1366
01:19:50,205 --> 01:19:51,077
The building is collapsing!

1367
01:19:51,079 --> 01:19:52,701
Raise!

1368
01:20:17,146 --> 01:20:18,235
Seung-Tae, go inside quickly!

1369
01:20:18,236 --> 01:20:19,065
What about dad?

1370
01:20:19,066 --> 01:20:20,399
Dad has to hold this.

1371
01:20:20,446 --> 01:20:21,945
Go in, hurry up! tell Seung-Tae to come in

1372
01:20:21,946 --> 01:20:22,946
Seung-Tae come on!!

1373
01:20:47,597 --> 01:20:48,497
Su-Chan!?

1374
01:20:48,557 --> 01:20:49,557
Dad!

1375
01:20:51,517 --> 01:20:52,647
Dad!

1376
01:21:11,918 --> 01:21:13,851
Seung-Hoon let's go together!

1377
01:21:18,878 --> 01:21:19,878
Seung-Hoon!

1378
01:21:22,008 --> 01:21:23,947
Seung-Hoon let's go together

1379
01:21:24,428 --> 01:21:25,969
Seung-Hoon

1380
01:21:26,849 --> 01:21:28,313
Seung-Hoon.

1381
01:21:37,069 --> 01:21:38,336
Where is the chief?

1382
01:21:39,189 --> 01:21:40,189
Under.

1383
01:21:41,859 --> 01:21:45,866
I failed to.. keep hold of the rope.

1384
01:21:48,789 --> 01:21:49,989
How could that be?

1385
01:21:56,460 --> 01:21:57,460
Su-Chan.

1386
01:22:26,701 --> 01:22:27,701
Su-Chan!!

1387
01:22:36,711 --> 01:22:37,711
Su-Chan.

1388
01:22:39,091 --> 01:22:40,091
Su-Chan.

1389
01:22:42,301 --> 01:22:43,301
Su-Chan.

1390
01:22:45,551 --> 01:22:46,551
Su-Chan.

1391
01:22:54,351 --> 01:22:56,230
Su-Chan dad here!!

1392
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:58,232
Dad.

1393
01:22:59,062 --> 01:23:00,062
Su-Chan.

1394
01:23:02,482 --> 01:23:03,482
Su-Chan.

1395
01:23:11,622 --> 01:23:12,736
Su-Chan!?

1396
01:23:13,872 --> 01:23:15,596
Dad.

1397
01:23:15,622 --> 01:23:16,755
Dad will save you.

1398
01:23:19,042 --> 01:23:20,042
Dad.

1399
01:23:23,842 --> 01:23:24,842
Su-Chan.

1400
01:23:25,553 --> 01:23:27,926
Dad.

1401
01:23:39,193 --> 01:23:40,807
Su-Chan, are you okay?

1402
01:23:41,653 --> 01:23:43,167
My son, are you okay?

1403
01:23:43,823 --> 01:23:45,753
Where's mom?

1404
01:23:45,993 --> 01:23:51,612
Mom?! mom is waiting for you at home.

1405
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:58,011
Su-Chan, let's go home.

1406
01:23:58,504 --> 01:23:59,546
Let's go home.

1407
01:24:01,884 --> 01:24:03,944
Where's Seung-Hoon?

1408
01:24:05,714 --> 01:24:06,714
Seung Hoon?

1409
01:24:16,524 --> 01:24:17,928
Grandma?

1410
01:24:35,295 --> 01:24:38,527
Thank you, is grandma okay?

1411
01:24:40,715 --> 01:24:42,480
My son is not doing well.

1412
01:24:43,637 --> 01:24:44,637
What?

1413
01:26:16,558 --> 01:26:17,558
Grandma.

1414
01:27:00,110 --> 01:27:02,920
Grandma, you have to come with me.

1415
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:09,431
You all go.

1416
01:27:13,410 --> 01:27:15,259
Come with us please.

1417
01:27:19,130 --> 01:27:20,130
Grandma.

1418
01:27:26,381 --> 01:27:27,630
How is the situation now?

1419
01:27:27,631 --> 01:27:30,089
Everywhere has collapsed and
the water has flooded in.

1420
01:27:35,271 --> 01:27:36,271
Chief.

1421
01:28:33,323 --> 01:28:34,739
Sorry Seng-Hoon.

1422
01:28:36,953 --> 01:28:38,062
Sorry.

1423
01:28:41,173 --> 01:28:44,172
Uncle can't take you to your mother's side.

1424
01:28:56,224 --> 01:28:58,939
You have to live

1425
01:29:00,144 --> 01:29:01,626
I'm sorry grandma

1426
01:29:08,574 --> 01:29:10,356
Seung-Hoon.

1427
01:29:29,555 --> 01:29:31,088
Su-Chan let's go to mom.

1428
01:30:15,226 --> 01:30:16,966
Su-Chan, hold tight to dad.

1429
01:30:17,396 --> 01:30:18,396
Yes.

1430
01:30:31,367 --> 01:30:32,367
Su-Chan, are you okay?

1431
01:30:32,407 --> 01:30:33,407
Dad.

1432
01:30:34,407 --> 01:30:35,326
Hold on to dad.

1433
01:30:35,327 --> 01:30:36,327
Yes.

1434
01:30:58,478 --> 01:30:59,478
What sound is that?

1435
01:31:56,620 --> 01:31:57,620
We're here!

1436
01:31:59,330 --> 01:32:00,330
Chief?

1437
01:32:11,590 --> 01:32:12,590

1451
01:33:11,952 --> 01:33:13,361
- Hold on!
- Are you alright?

1452
01:33:13,362 --> 01:33:14,374
Manager Kim.

1453
01:33:15,412 --> 01:33:16,412
Su-Chan!

1454
01:33:17,032 --> 01:33:18,721
- Come here.
- Su-Chan, are you okay?

1455
01:33:18,723 --> 01:33:20,123
Chief Park, come here.

1456
01:33:22,923 --> 01:33:24,456
Be careful of your head.

1457
01:33:24,713 --> 01:33:25,542
Su-Chan.

1458
01:33:25,543 --> 01:33:26,543
Oh Lord.

1459
01:33:26,593 --> 01:33:27,593
Quickly.

1460
01:33:30,013 --> 01:33:31,013
Su-Chan, are you okay?

1461
01:33:31,843 --> 01:33:32,552
Okay?

1462
01:33:32,553 --> 01:33:33,739
Hello

1463
01:33:33,741 --> 01:33:34,741
are you okay?

1464
01:33:35,803 --> 01:33:37,067
Help us.

1465
01:33:38,158 --> 01:33:39,158
Hold him.

1466
01:33:39,938 --> 01:33:40,938
Be careful.

1467
01:33:44,193 --> 01:33:45,402
Ahh you're still alive.

1468
01:33:45,403 --> 01:33:46,621
Chief! Chief!

1469
01:33:46,943 --> 01:33:49,661
- You are safe! you are alive!
- Good Work.

1470
01:33:49,904 --> 01:33:51,442
Good work.

1471
01:33:53,704 --> 01:33:55,837
Hurry up, it's starting to flood.

1472
01:34:25,945 --> 01:34:29,145
Ohh look above...
Why is there a building above?

1473
01:34:30,695 --> 01:34:32,181
Will it fall later?

1474
01:34:33,365 --> 01:34:34,638
I see it moving.

1475
01:34:39,705 --> 01:34:41,572
The water seems to be rising.

1476
01:34:41,625 --> 01:34:42,825
What should we do?

1477
01:34:44,165 --> 01:34:45,762
What should we do about this?

1478
01:34:54,556 --> 01:34:55,556
This!

1479
01:34:56,006 --> 01:34:56,935
This!

1480
01:34:56,936 --> 01:34:57,936
Use this.

1481
01:34:59,476 --> 01:35:01,655
Bring everything that can float.

1482
01:35:01,896 --> 01:35:02,835
Come search!

1483
01:35:02,873 --> 01:35:04,006
The floating ones.

1484
01:35:04,646 --> 01:35:05,646
Here.

1485
01:35:11,655 --> 01:35:12,655

1487
01:35:25,087 --> 01:35:27,234
Seung-Tae, look again!!

1488
01:36:11,548 --> 01:36:13,327
Look what mister brought!

1489
01:36:13,508 --> 01:36:14,764
All of you, get up here.

1490
01:36:15,508 --> 01:36:16,508
Come on!

1491
01:36:17,519 --> 01:36:19,977
Mister, this is that!

1492
01:36:19,979 --> 01:36:21,046
Yellow Submarine.

1493
01:36:21,439 --> 01:36:24,218
The Beatles' Yellow Submarine.

1494
01:36:27,479 --> 01:36:29,835
Dad? where is the lid?

1495
01:36:29,989 --> 01:36:30,989
Lid?

1496
01:36:31,319 --> 01:36:33,093
Has anyone seen the lid?

1497
01:36:34,166 --> 01:36:35,166
Lid?

1498
01:36:35,949 --> 01:36:36,949
That's it.

1499
01:36:37,119 --> 01:36:38,292
Is that it?

1500
01:36:42,763 --> 01:36:44,135
Try closing it.

1501
01:36:48,670 --> 01:36:50,125
It fits!!

1502
01:36:50,127 --> 01:36:51,586
Yes.

1503
01:36:53,090 --> 01:36:54,759
No. 501, let Su-Chan go first.

1504
01:36:54,760 --> 01:36:55,281
Ok.

1505
01:36:55,283 --> 01:36:56,283
Eun-Jjoo go up!

1506
01:37:00,350 --> 01:37:01,350
Su-Chan.

1507
01:37:02,230 --> 01:37:03,099
Manager Kim.

1508
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:04,100
Yes.

1509
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:10,186
Be careful.

1510
01:37:10,188 --> 01:37:11,188
Dad.

1511
01:37:12,950 --> 01:37:13,883
Go on, quickly.

1512
01:37:13,950 --> 01:37:14,950
Get in

1513
01:37:15,531 --> 01:37:16,531

1514
01:37:27,341 --> 01:37:28,341
Hurry up.

1515
01:37:30,511 --> 01:37:31,511
Be careful

1516
01:37:32,801 --> 01:37:34,022

1517
01:37:35,591 --> 01:37:36,591
Come on chief.

1518
01:37:42,101 --> 01:37:43,479
Brother, come on in.

1519
01:37:43,481 --> 01:37:44,479
Dad, climb in

1520
01:37:44,481 --> 01:37:46,886
I'll come back quickly.

1521
01:37:47,862 --> 01:37:48,762
What?

1522
01:37:48,862 --> 01:37:51,018
Whose going to close it
after if we all went up?

1523
01:37:53,794 --> 01:37:54,794
Dad!!

1524
01:37:55,742 --> 01:37:56,571
Dad.

1525
01:37:56,572 --> 01:37:57,472
Brother!!

1526
01:37:57,492 --> 01:37:58,492
Mister.

1527
01:37:58,582 --> 01:37:59,582
Dad.

1528
01:38:02,792 --> 01:38:03,692
Mister

1529
01:38:03,694 --> 01:38:06,837
Seung-Tae, dad will catch up.

1530
01:38:07,265 --> 01:38:09,392
- Dad!!
- Mister.

1531
01:38:11,012 --> 01:38:11,631
Dad.

1532
01:38:11,633 --> 01:38:12,759
Dad.

1533
01:38:12,761 --> 01:38:15,072
- Uncle
- Mister.

1534
01:38:15,689 --> 01:38:16,518
Brother.

1535
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:17,520
Mister.

1536
01:38:33,364 --> 01:38:35,408
- Mister
- Brother.

1537
01:38:35,598 --> 01:38:36,498
Dad.

1538
01:38:36,613 --> 01:38:37,513
Brother!

1539
01:38:37,533 --> 01:38:38,251
Dad.

1540
01:38:38,253 --> 01:38:39,253
Mister.

1541
01:38:40,076 --> 01:38:41,076
Dad…

1542
01:38:45,164 --> 01:38:46,164
Dad.

1543
01:38:50,294 --> 01:38:51,294
Dad!!

1544
01:38:55,606 --> 01:38:57,497
Open the lid!

1545
01:38:59,304 --> 01:39:00,304
Dad.

1546
01:39:49,696 --> 01:39:51,694
Su-Chan, are you okay?

1547
01:39:51,696 --> 01:39:53,296
Seung-Tae, are you okay?

1548
01:40:02,416 --> 01:40:04,090
It seems to be tangled in something.

1549
01:40:05,666 --> 01:40:06,799
It's okay Su-Chan.

1550
01:40:12,586 --> 01:40:13,654
We have to push!

1551
01:40:22,227 --> 01:40:23,127
Jump!

1552
01:40:23,129 --> 01:40:24,129
Jump.

1553
01:40:47,088 --> 01:40:48,118
It's going up.

1554
01:40:58,598 --> 01:40:59,860
Eun-Joo push!!

1555
01:41:00,098 --> 01:41:02,225
- Push Eunjoo hard!!
- What do we do??

1556
01:41:24,999 --> 01:41:26,059
Keep pushing!!

1557
01:41:37,599 --> 01:41:39,050
Take it out!!

1558
01:43:18,533 --> 01:43:19,824
What is this?

1559
01:43:24,511 --> 01:43:26,671
Water is coming inside.

1560
01:43:27,634 --> 01:43:28,968
Its leaking!!

1561
01:43:36,803 --> 01:43:38,270
Is there anyone there?

1562
01:43:38,303 --> 01:43:41,073
- Help!
- Help.

1563
01:43:42,394 --> 01:43:43,394
Help!

1564
01:43:44,644 --> 01:43:45,644
Anybody there?

1565
01:44:01,574 --> 01:44:02,574
Help!

1566
01:44:04,414 --> 01:44:05,414
Dad.

1567
01:44:07,954 --> 01:44:10,736
Help! help.

1568
01:44:14,465 --> 01:44:16,408
Is there anyone there?

1569
01:44:21,238 --> 01:44:22,298
Anybody there?

1570
01:44:33,195 --> 01:44:34,630
Hey! What's that!!

1571
01:44:36,615 --> 01:44:38,482
Captain, they're alive!!

1572
01:44:42,366 --> 01:44:44,209
They are safe, They are safe!

1573
01:44:59,846 --> 01:45:01,695
My dad is here!!

1574
01:45:04,016 --> 01:45:05,203
Is everyone fine?

1575
01:45:05,936 --> 01:45:06,936
My child.

1576
01:45:07,896 --> 01:45:09,813
Hello.

1577
01:45:09,996 --> 01:45:10,575
Yes.

1578
01:45:10,577 --> 01:45:11,577
Dad.

1579
01:45:12,777 --> 01:45:14,377
My son Seung-Tae..

1580
01:45:15,410 --> 01:45:17,292
We're safe!!

1581
01:47:20,991 --> 01:47:22,917
Where are we?

1582
01:47:23,406 --> 01:47:24,869
Try calling.

1583
01:47:24,871 --> 01:47:26,620
He said near here, beside the Han River.

1584
01:47:26,621 --> 01:47:28,652
We've been along the
Han river all this time.

1585
01:47:28,654 --> 01:47:30,289
How can there be a house here?

1586
01:47:30,291 --> 01:47:32,973
Exactly, how can he have a house here?

1587
01:47:33,301 --> 01:47:34,301
Chief Park!

1588
01:47:36,761 --> 01:47:39,421
Hey Manager Kim, I brought this.

1589
01:47:39,423 --> 01:47:41,156
Ah you bought toilet paper.

1590
01:47:45,222 --> 01:47:46,430
Aih.. is this your house?

1591
01:47:47,272 --> 01:47:48,539
Is this your house?

1592
01:47:49,023 --> 01:47:50,023
This is home.

1593
01:47:51,022 --> 01:47:54,086
Today's view is Han River and tomorrow's
view is Mount Namsan

1594
01:47:54,088 --> 01:47:57,401
I'm going to Haeundae on the weekend. This
is my new home where you can go anywhere.

1595
01:47:57,402 --> 01:48:00,447
Bed, refrigerator, stove,
everything is there.

1596
01:48:00,572 --> 01:48:01,781
There's everything here.

1597
01:48:01,782 --> 01:48:02,782
Reasonable.

1598
01:48:05,082 --> 01:48:07,621
However.

1599
01:48:07,623 --> 01:48:10,541
A house must be in one place.

1600
01:48:10,543 --> 01:48:14,042
It is called a house if it is occupied
for 10 or 20 years.

1601
01:48:14,043 --> 01:48:14,943
Hey.

1602
01:48:15,003 --> 01:48:16,882
Don't wait 10 years to be happy.

1603
01:48:16,883 --> 01:48:20,186
- Let us be happy today.
- Let us be happy today.

1604
01:48:20,223 --> 01:48:22,762
- Let us be in love forever.
- Let us be in love forever.

1605
01:48:22,763 --> 01:48:23,663
Good.

1606
01:48:23,723 --> 01:48:25,062
This is just our thoughts.

1607
01:48:25,063 --> 01:48:27,852
We plan to use the house buying
money to travel to the North Pole.

1608
01:48:27,853 --> 01:48:30,997
But there's too little
food and drinks here.

1609
01:48:31,273 --> 01:48:33,362
You can order delivery of any kind,
Should I order anything?

1610
01:48:33,363 --> 01:48:34,905
Delivery?

1611
01:48:43,742 --> 01:48:45,427
Ground Roast Chicken!

1612
01:48:45,748 --> 01:48:46,748
Amazing!!

1613
01:48:48,700 --> 01:48:49,972
Amazing!!

1614
01:48:49,974 --> 01:48:51,455
Take a look at this! Look!

1615
01:49:04,974 --> 01:49:06,221
You guys scared?!!

1616
01:49:19,485 --> 01:49:20,485
Come see this.

1617
01:49:33,045 --> 01:49:35,370
Ah damn, it scared me.

1618
01:49:35,640 --> 01:49:36,640
Scared?

1619
01:49:38,676 --> 01:49:40,403
Isn't our house amazing?

1620
01:49:40,596 --> 01:49:42,379
Ahh so nice.

1621
01:49:42,667 --> 01:49:44,467
Ahh I want to live here too.

1622
01:49:48,803 --> 01:49:50,136
Ahh really beautiful.

1623
01:49:51,335 --> 01:49:52,335
Good!!
