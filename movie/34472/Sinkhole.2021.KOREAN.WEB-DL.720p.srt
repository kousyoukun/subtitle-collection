1
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,925
Alright! We're here.

2
00:01:15,494 --> 00:01:17,227
It's raining so hard here.

3
00:01:17,574 --> 00:01:19,538
Must be hard to drive around.

4
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,512
What? It still haven't moved?

5
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:31,559
Did you manage to move the truck?

6
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,229
It still can't be moved yet.

7
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:33,809
Why?

8
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,610
We need to wait until this car been moved.

9
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,189
The owner doesn't answer the
phone even after an hour

10
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,149
I even sent a text message
but still no reply.

11
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,350
Damn, when its raining this much!

12
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,600
Hello..

13
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,373
What's happening?

14
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,787
Wow, this guy is so rude!

15
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,810
Wow, are there really people like this?

16
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,690
Seriously.

17
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:23,670
Damn.

18
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:46,990
Bastard!

19
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,490
You!!

20
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,180
Mister!!

21
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,220
Me?

22
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,220
Yes you!

23
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,199
Why didn't you answer your phone
when we called this much?

24
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,199
The cargo truck can't be moved.

25
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,369
We had to wait for your car to
be moved for over an hour.

26
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,919
I set the phone to vibrate.

27
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,919
But earlier I heard your cell
phone ringing loudly?

28
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,987
I didn't hear it.

29
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,820
I was sleeping inside.

30
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,200
OK?

31
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,266
Ahh I really don't understand.

32
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,549
What do you mean?

33
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,799
Is it so hard to apologize to someone?

34
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,933
What do I need to apologize for?

35
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,309
You are the one who should apologize.

36
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,599
This is Sunday! It's not good
to disturb people's holidays.

37
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,729
My car was parked well, but still told
to move, what a waste of gas!

38
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,399
If you take all day to move house.

39
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,467
How much more annoying are you!

40
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,510
Am I wrong?

41
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,029
Can you speak well and politely?

42
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,359
I'm speaking polietly, arent I?

43
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,427
Then why did you poke my chest?

44
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,987
I think you need to exercise.

45
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:01,690
What?

46
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,499
I said you should exercise!

47
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,400
Dear!

48
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:07,950
Hello..

49
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,120
Oh, this is must be your family..

50
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,660
Welcome.

51
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,679
Dad, were you fighting?

52
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,580
Fighting?

53
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,207
Fighting? What fighting?

54
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:21,808
Fighting between adults?

55
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,353
No, we didn't fight.

56
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:33,990
It's going up..

57
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,413
Now its coming down.

58
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,883
It's raining so hard.

59
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,259
You must be new here.

60
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,193
Oh yes, hello.

61
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,559
You live here too?

62
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,259
Yes.

63
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,349
Oh, I live in 501

64
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,550
nice to meet you..

65
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,580
Oh the same.

66
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:04,630
Oh my.

67
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,479
I heard that moving on a rainy day
is said to make a lot of money.

68
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,380
Ah, thank you.

69
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,940
Have a good day.

70
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,230
Yes. be careful.

71
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,270
Hello.

72
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,520
Sung-Hoon.

73
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,119
If you are hungry.

74
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,789
Just use the microwave to heat the rice.

75
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:27,629
Yes.

76
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,030
And never open the door to strangers.

77
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,110
Yes.

78
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,607
Mom come home early.

79
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,719
If it rains, close the windows!

80
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,455
- Alright.
- Good!

81
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,400
Its very relaxing.

82
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,399
Its because this is our home.

83
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,666
This house is very nice.

84
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,920
Because this is our home.

85
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,337
This house is really very comfortable.

86
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,673
That's because this is our house.

87
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,650
Dad.

88
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,440
When will the TV arrive?

89
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,700
Su-Chan.

90
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,960
Take a look at our house first

91
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,803
TV TV!!

92
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:21,897
Here! Su-Chan!

93
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,229
Honey Because you're going to
be working much harder now.

94
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,479
Exercise a bit more and.

95
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,747
Learn English again.

96
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,617
Do everything you want.

97
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,620
We still have a lot of debt.

98
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,100
We need more money

99
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,587
I will pay the tuition fee for you.

100
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,700
You seem thrilled to hear your
wife pay the money for you?

101
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,400
Stupid!

102
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:03,970
Yah! Haven't had breakfast
like this in years.

103
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,139
Busy company business makes
me unable to eat breakfast.

104
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,939
Su-Chan, let's have breakfast!

105
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,840
Ok.

106
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:10,880
Here we go

107
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,243
eat a lot, please.

108
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,569
Do you want me to show you something fun?

109
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,770
What? what's that?

110
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,020
Great catch!

111
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,523
Wow? What did the movers do yesterday?

112
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,709
This table should be placed stably.

113
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,043
No! they can also roll on the floor.

114
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:36,497
Hey, why are you even playing while eating?

115
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:01,810
Damn!!!

116
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,329
Why are you so afraid like that?

117
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,923
I'm just a human.

118
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,095
Who's scared?!

119
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,260
It's obvious you're scared?

120
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,360
Come on in!

121
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,419
Enter!

122
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,749
You are right, go here.

123
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,083
You have to stay fit.

124
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,317
You are right.

125
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,299
For you, I give it cheaper
Come on!

126
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,129
Are you the owner of this Gym place?

127
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,139
I'm not the boss.

128
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,223
But something similar

129
00:08:25,725 --> 00:08:27,192
I'm the coach here.

130
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,777
Oh, look at that...

131
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,429
I'm afraid it's too late

132
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,230
I will consider coming back.

133
00:08:32,475 --> 00:08:34,409
What's too late? Really weird.

134
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,380
Excuse me.

135
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,147
Yes Yes Good!

136
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:41,225
Ok so.

137
00:08:41,227 --> 00:08:42,699
You made the right decision.

138
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,600
Not that...

139
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,869
Stop it! Let's register right away.

140
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:46,869
House.. House..

141
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,239
- House.
- What happened to the house?

142
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,973
Do you think our houses are a bit tilted?

143
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,553
How can our houses be tilted?

144
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,459
I think my living room
floor is a bit slanted.

145
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,327
It unbalances household items.

146
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,339
No! no! No!

147
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,140
My living room is very flat.

148
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,830
- If you have marbles in your house...
- WHAT!!

149
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,147
I'm a grown man now.

150
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,179
Do you think I still play with marbles?

151
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:07,889
No.

152
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:08,849
Forget it, let's register

153
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:09,750
I am late!

154
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,059
Strange people!!

155
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,127
What am I doing?

156
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,533
What is such a person called?

157
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,347
- Chief!
- Yes.

158
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,659
I heard you bought a house
in Seoul and have moved?

159
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,560
Yes.

160
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,619
Congratulations.

161
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,079
Why didn't you tell us?

162
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,813
Congratulations Chief Park.

163
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,607
Oh, it's not that big of a deal.

164
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,960
Congratulations.

165
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,243
Thanks, all of you.

166
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,587
To celebrate Mr. Park who
bought a house in Seoul city.

167
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,949
Let's all clap!

168
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:48,679
Clap Clap.

169
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,309
Our chief Park bought a house in Seoul.

170
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,472
His own house!

171
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,769
Don't clap, don't clap.

172
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:55,237
It's not something big.

173
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:56,899
In which neighborhood do you live?

174
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,900
Changshou-dong.

175
00:09:58,690 --> 00:09:59,590
Ah that.

176
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,344
Isn't there an industrial complex
in Changshou-dong?

177
00:10:02,656 --> 00:10:04,359
The industrial complex has
been gone for a long time.

178
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,489
When I was little, my dad's
car was dumped there.

179
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:10,757
The car waste plant has been
gone for a long time.

180
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,869
Now there is an eco-friendly community.

181
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,870
Isn't there a noisy subway
in Changshou-dong?

182
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,629
How can I hear the sound of the subway?

183
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,499
Then how can a new building be built now?

184
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,299
Also the wall is surrounded
by two or three layers.

185
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,433
Even if there is a war,
we can't hear anything.

186
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,009
Is this your house?

187
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:29,910
No, no!

188
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,617
Watch the ball roll.

189
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,620
The ball just rolls on the floor.

190
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,404
Is this the floor of a room
or a football field?

191
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,019
- This is a house?
- When are you guys coming?

192
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,979
When will you guys visit for house warming?

193
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,399
- Its nice if its sooner.
- Ok. The sooner the better, right?

194
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,300
I accept.

195
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,401
- Please work.
- Okay.

196
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,540
Why are you playing with that?

197
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,920
I heard if the house is tilted..

198
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:08,743
The window frame will change and
the sliding window will get stuck.

199
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,037
Is it okay now?

200
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,393
Excuse me.

201
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,331
Anyone here?

202
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,569
You made an appointment beforehand right?

203
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,319
I made an appointment online.

204
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,453
For half discount.

205
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,779
Great!

206
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,680
I want too.

207
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,329
How is it?

208
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:41,709
If our family could hang a family portrait,
it would be beautiful, wouldn't it?

209
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,610
Yes.

210
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,710
Looks real good.

211
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,900
Right?

212
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,549
The owner of this place.

213
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,883
Has it set up nicely.

214
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,443
It's supposed to be this cool.

215
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,450
Hello.

216
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,330
Hel..

217
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:55,910
OH..

218
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,859
Why do you always get scared
every time I see you?

219
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,853
Is the owner of this place away?

220
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,928
I am the owner.

221
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,488
Hello.

222
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:15,369
Gosh.. hello.

223
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,373
Hi hello too.

224
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,890
You are very handsome.

225
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,045
How about the gym upstairs?

226
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,789
The gym was opened by my sister

227
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:26,323
I just... help check it every few days.

228
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,017
This 's my main task.

229
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,423
Okay? You are very well dressed today.

230
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,030
Set.

231
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,040
Set.

232
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,309
Okay, this is a good composition.

233
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,210
Lets shoot.

234
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,580
Oh madam.

235
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,602
Your posture is too elegant.

236
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,550
Hello sir.

237
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,269
Do you feel uncomfortable?

238
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,787
Let's take a quick photo now.

239
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,090
Okay, then.

240
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,360
Let's put on a nice expression

241
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,545
I wil take a portrait of
this harmonious family.

242
00:12:58,731 --> 00:12:59,631
Pity.

243
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,910
Come one, smile.

244
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,385
Hey that's great.

245
00:13:06,401 --> 00:13:07,129
Come on!

246
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,463
I'll take a picture!

247
00:13:08,604 --> 00:13:09,504
One…

248
00:13:10,421 --> 00:13:11,266
Two three!

249
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,784
Ahh so nice.

250
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,549
Wow, what a great result

251
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,217
Seoul looks more beautiful when it rains.

252
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,920
We came here from far away empty handed.

253
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,506
It took 11 years to own my own house.

254
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,800
You worked hard.

255
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,260
Its all thanks to you

256
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,800
I'm the one thankful to you.

257
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,292
Let's drink

258
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,355
I'm driving.

259
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,511
This is Seoul.

260
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,489
How expensive is it to find a driver?

261
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:38,390
I'll pay.

262
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,699
Okay then, let's have a drink.

263
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,600
Cheers!

264
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,980
I want too.

265
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,749
Cheers!!

266
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,329
Mister driver, where are you?

267
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,215
Ah! I'm here.

268
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,418
Ah I see you

269
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,514
I can see you.

270
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,576
I will do my best.

271
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,193
To take you home comfortably.

272
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,724
Hello.

273
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,021
Oh hello hello.

274
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:03,743
Hello.

275
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,687
Why are you afraid again?

276
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,803
The speed limit ahead is 60 kilometers.

277
00:14:10,013 --> 00:14:10,913
Stop.

278
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,260
Stop!

279
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,890
Photographed.. we were photographed!

280
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,949
Ahh we're being photographed
by speed cameras.

281
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,017
Not photographed.

282
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,473
I saw a speed camera flash.

283
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,659
Gosh, we're not being photographed.

284
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,669
Yellow... the yellow light mean to stop.
How can you go on?

285
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:31,870
Some people stop at a yellow light
and some continue to drive

286
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,879
I'm one of those people who keep driving.

287
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,509
According to traffic laws you must stop.

288
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,510
No.. We can go.

289
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,240
Wow.

290
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,575
Wow... I'll show you.

291
00:14:44,883 --> 00:14:46,350
I found it, here look!

292
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,500
This!

293
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:48,710
See?

294
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,460
Look!

295
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,380
Here look!

296
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,860
We have arrived.

297
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,653
Isn't this telling the yellow
light means to stop?

298
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,510
Oh, Su-Chan did you have a good time.

299
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,329
- Right.
- Thank you Uncle.

300
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,230
Please go inside.

301
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,060
Hey.

302
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,499
Do you prefer anything?

303
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,839
It's easy for us if you like something.

304
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,160
- Maybe something you need in your new home.
- What's the budget?

305
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,407
200,000 or more

306
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:17,681
200,000?

307
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,299
Manager Kim!
Isn't that Eun-Joo?

308
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,399
Go help her.

309
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:26,217
Eun-Joo, just let it be,
I'll do it later.

310
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,210
No need

311
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,610
- I can do it.
- Okay.

312
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,049
Damn bastard!

313
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,087
Cooking utensil.

314
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,417
Electronic blankets.

315
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:40,029
Can't you just give me some money?

316
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:43,119
- It will be engraved with your name.
- Just give me the money

317
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,884
I have something I want and
am a little short on money.

318
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:48,985
What is this chair?

319
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,459
Company collegues bought
me this as a present.

320
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,727
Isn't it expensive?

321
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,070
How do I know

322
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:01,969
I'm the one whose tired,
why are you the one on the expensive chair?

323
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,703
It's common chair, common.

324
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,139
Dad

325
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,340
I also want to try

326
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,040
just go play.

327
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,250
No.

328
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,079
Just let him try it.

329
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,809
Isn't it common property which
whole familiy can use?

330
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,743
My wife want to sit on it too.

331
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,029
Then you just sleep in that rocking chair.

332
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,963
Sleep forever!

333
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:21,850
Let's go.

334
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,787
Why is this happening?

335
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:09,153
What is wrong? It's not like
getting hit by a rock.

336
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:12,212
Could it break by itself?

337
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,860
Mister.

338
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:23,603
I didn't do it.

339
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,445
Who else if not you?

340
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,555
Damn, it's really not me!

341
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,594
Fix it as soon as possible.

342
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,019
Or do you want me to call the Police?

343
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,220
- Ah!
- What do you mean police?

344
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,349
Why are you looking like that?

345
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,092
Alright, then work hard okay.

346
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,249
- First, I'll take care of it...
- I don't have to help you.

347
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,039
Yes yes.

348
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,499
It's a newly built 5 storey
residential building.

349
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,194
Of course the municipal council should
take care of unsafe development.

350
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,194
Is there any visible damage?

351
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,600
So the residents should
have a meeting first..

352
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,608
and must all residents agree?

353
00:18:13,131 --> 00:18:14,679
This building where we live in.

354
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,747
Maintenance service is not good.

355
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,979
Frankly I want to tell you all is that
something is wrong now.

356
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,109
What's wrong with the house?

357
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,569
First of all the windows start to get stuck.

358
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,738
And it's not good.

359
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,017
This proves that our house is tilted.

360
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:32,079
- Damn the tilted house again!
- Our house is tilted?

361
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,949
If it is reported that our house is like this,
it will cause house prices to fall.

362
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,619
- That's right.
- But my window is stuck too.

363
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,419
How about house 202? Is it alright?

364
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:43,087
Ah.. I'm at the store more often,
so I'm rarely at home.

365
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,919
How about number 502?
How is it?

366
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,299
I just always smell of smoke from below.

367
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,437
And the windows of our house have long
been closed I'm not so sure either.

368
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,627
Maybe from house number 401?

369
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,242
No one smokes in my house.

370
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,695
If its not you who else then?

371
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,562
Look at your dry face.

372
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,908
Isn't it like a bamboo pole?

373
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:09,109
Ahh damn, what a bastard is this woman?!

374
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,488
I've quit smoking for over 10 years.

375
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,901
What smell of smoke?

376
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,079
Okay.

377
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,213
Try to smell this.

378
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:16,829
There is a smell of smoke!

379
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:17,959
- What?
- He smells of cigarettes.

380
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,093
Don't fight, please don't fight!

381
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,249
You two are like husband and wife.

382
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,918
You are sinners.

383
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,258
Everyone, stop arguing, stop arguing.

384
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:30,873
No, they suspect me.
I hate being suspected!

385
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,799
Ahh, I want to die.

386
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,408
Dad, next month.

387
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,439
Will send you to Civil Servant school.

388
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,478
Do not worry.

389
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,148
But dad has no money.

390
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,819
Hey, dad has distributed flyers.

391
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,765
Worked in call center.

392
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:57,797
If you smoke.

393
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,430
Go up to the top floor and smoke.

394
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:06,169
The occupant of our upper house said
the smell of smoke, they said.

395
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,969
They can smell the smoke.

396
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,602
I don't smoke.

397
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,179
Right, you don't smoke, do you?

398
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,589
Look, I'm going to go to tell her...

399
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:16,190
I have to give a 502 tenant a lesson...

400
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,559
Hey Seung-tae.

401
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,849
Daddy won't say, eat, eat.

402
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:19,750
Let's eat.

403
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:29,510
Come out.

404
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:30,489
-Take the gifts -Okay.

405
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:31,699
The environment is quite clean, right?

406
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,449
Let's go!

407
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,517
Calm and it's suitable for kids.

408
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,453
It's very quiet here.

409
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,940
What is this?

410
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,973
The old woman who lives in 301
keeps threatening me to death.

411
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,049
It's the plastic used to
make winter Kimchi.

412
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:49,709
That's pretty good in my opinion.

413
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,377
It's definitely not glass.

414
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,598
Of course! I know that.

415
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,097
This is not real glass.

416
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,324
You are so stiff.

417
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,094
I haven't seen winter
kimchi in a long time.

418
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,099
They came here for house warming right?

419
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,767
Hello, we are all co-workers of Chief Park.

420
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:07,785
Ah, apparently you are a Chief

421
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,399
thank you

422
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,280
hey no. 501, wait a minute!

423
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:13,215
I found some flaws.

424
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,140
Look at this!

425
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:19,168
It's in that back parking lot

426
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:20,877
I think it has a crack.

427
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:23,039
This is the entrance to the parking lot.

428
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,789
You saw it right, the big crack.

429
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,789
You have to take a closer
look to find them!

430
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:29,217
Our house is really a mess.

431
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,379
There's more here.

432
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,629
Are you saying this is
the current situation?

433
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,592
Current situation!!

434
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:37,139
This is not only a current problem
but a future problem too.

435
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,759
This is amazing. Look over there!

436
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,178
There are more.

437
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,558
Alright now!!

438
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,827
Take a look at this.

439
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:45,161
It's everywhere here.

440
00:21:45,163 --> 00:21:46,341
This is...

441
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,388
Come see.

442
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,359
This is dangerous, seriously!

443
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,141
How come people live here?

444
00:21:53,143 --> 00:21:54,774
Why do you press that?

445
00:21:54,968 --> 00:21:56,532
Come here! straight through here!

446
00:21:56,675 --> 00:21:57,575
Enter!

447
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,230
That is true.

448
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,266
Come on in.

449
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,560
Enter!

450
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,358
Why, thank you.

451
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,249
- You bought a lot.
- Thank you.

452
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,711
- Yes.
- Thank you.

453
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,469
Hello.

454
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:11,610
Su-Chan!

455
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,140
Welcome, come in!

456
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,073
The house is very spacious.

457
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,679
- It smells great.
- It's not that much though.

458
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,580
Hello.

459
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,246
How much does this house cost?

460
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,657
Um... 3 Billion.

461
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:32,259
Gosh... Amazing!

462
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,259
What's amazing?

463
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:35,510
That!

464
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,239
Isn't it very similar to Mount Everest?

465
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,973
The mountain you see
but you can't visit.

466
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:48,169
Even if you win the jackpot,
you won't be able to go there.

467
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:50,437
Who doesn't understand Apartments?

468
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:52,763
Don't you understand the market?

469
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,680
I wouldn't buy it if I couldn't afford it.

470
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:59,613
You have to find money by taking a  loan.

471
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,097
Then you can buy an apartment.

472
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,546
Manager Jung bought an apartment
for 450 million earlier this year.

473
00:23:06,548 --> 00:23:07,769
Hey don't say that.

474
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,769
House prices increased by
200 million in 6 months

475
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:10,858
200 million??

476
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,220
Yes!!

477
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,450
Wow up 200 million.

478
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,107
Up 200 million.

479
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,138
That much..

480
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,360
Eun-Joo?!

481
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,799
Its not polite to leave the table
until you're done drinking.

482
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,400
Come here sit down again.

483
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,977
I want to drink alone.

484
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,280
Suddenly?

485
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,330
Yes!

486
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,019
Eun-Joo, your glass is empty.

487
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:48,809
Manager Kim!

488
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,677
Please pour some for Eun-Joo.

489
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:54,023
Where are you going?

490
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:55,510
Toilet!

491
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:59,117
Oh, I should get some watermelon
from the fridge too.

492
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,119
Manager Jung, why aren't you drinking?

493
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,453
I have to drive home.

494
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:05,909
Just drinking coke is enough

495
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:06,989
I will help call a driver for you

496
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,949
I really just want to drink coke.

497
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,166
No need no need

498
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,669
I have the driver's phone number.

499
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:12,570
Really crazy.

500
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,780
Here he is.

501
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,240
This.

502
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,650
- Let's drink!
- No.

503
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,339
- Let's drink!
- No need.

504
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,259
It does not matter.

505
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,727
- It's okay.
- I'm serious.

506
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:30,710
Damn it!

507
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,210
What?

508
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,684
I will take you comfortably.

509
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,820
You came sir!

510
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,709
You came.

511
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,169
Oh you called the right person.

512
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:58,749
How can you drive if you drink like this?

513
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:02,218
This master will drive despite
the yellow light.

514
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,153
So you guys have to keep
an eye on it, okay?

515
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,410
Dear.

516
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,277
Have you eaten yet?

517
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,755
are you asking for real?

518
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,500
Yes.

519
00:25:17,094 --> 00:25:18,662
Oh brother?

520
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:23,149
Kimchi winter plastic installer is here.

521
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,909
Come on I'll pour you a glass.

522
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:25,810
No, no!

523
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,369
Cause I'll be driving.

524
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:29,837
Photographer Jeong Man, food is ready.

525
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,190
Is that right.

526
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,249
Ok.

527
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,150
Cheers.

528
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:35,230
Cheers.

529
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:38,629
Why didn't you have a drink
earlier Manager Jung?

530
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:40,497
Because the driver is here..

531
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:43,503
- Drink!
- When are we going home?

532
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,660
Why?

533
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,763
Wait a little longer.

534
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:54,983
What time is it.

535
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,883
Why are you whispering?

536
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,842
Why whisper??

537
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,653
Are you guys dating?

538
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:05,850
No!

539
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,569
No.

540
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,470
Chief.

541
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,197
Don't talk nonsense.

542
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,707
Am I talking nonsense?

543
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:15,525
Mr. Park really misunderstood.

544
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,953
Did I misunderstand?

545
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:18,890
Chief Park, are you drunk?

546
00:26:18,891 --> 00:26:19,958
You're not wrong.

547
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,507
We really love each other.

548
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,783
You bastard!!

549
00:26:31,221 --> 00:26:32,219
What are you doing?

550
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,849
They say they love each other

551
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:34,917
I'm sorry senior.

552
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,559
Don't call senior bastard!!

553
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,027
You're not my junior at all bastard!!

554
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,300
Hyo-Jeong!!

555
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,899
You can't call that name asshole!

556
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,567
Yes yes I'm ready to go!!

557
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,640
Manager Kim, don't follow your past!

558
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,490
Drink.

559
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,240
Drink.

560
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,067
It must be hard but.

561
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,883
Now its time to go home.

562
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,519
It's not good to stay in someone
else's house for too long.

563
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,720
Where do you live?

564
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:19,880
Cheongun-dong.

565
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,073
Hmm Cheongun-dong.

566
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:24,355
Where does Miss Rocking Chair live?

567
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:25,880
Anyang.

568
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,140
Anyang?

569
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,569
The car keys!

570
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:31,170
I will go to Anyang first then Cheongun.

571
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:32,827
But I won't drive.

572
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:35,310
Why?

573
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:38,530
I don't have a car.

574
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,499
Then we'll use our car.

575
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,879
Go to Anyang first then Cheongun.

576
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,549
Starting from Changsin-Dong...
30,000 plus 50,000.

577
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,719
Originally 90,000.

578
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,187
Makes you 80,000 only!

579
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,487
Eighty thousand????

580
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,599
Why?

581
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,219
This is the discounted price.

582
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,220
Just sleep here.

583
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,317
There are 3 rooms in our house.

584
00:27:58,770 --> 00:27:59,481
Wow.

585
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,512
I have to take you home soon.

586
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:05,319
Because your parents should
be worried about you.

587
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,220
Right?

588
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,836
I live alone.

589
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,760
Oh.

590
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,062
Living alone.

591
00:28:11,116 --> 00:28:12,849
There are 3 rooms, 3 rooms.

592
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,029
My son is sleeping in his room

593
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:17,937
I sleep with my wife in that room.

594
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,656
In the other room, let Manager Kim
and Eunjoo sleep together.

595
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,687
And..

596
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,356
Su-Chan sleeps in Su-Chan's room.

597
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,679
In the other one you sleep
with Manager Jung.

598
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,410
In the last room, Su-Chan't mother sleeps
with the woman who lives alone.

599
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:38,660
I will go home and sleep alone!!

600
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:40,143
Wow you are so smart.

601
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:41,960
Right?

602
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,697
Where is Manager Jung?

603
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,493
Please be careful.

604
00:28:51,819 --> 00:28:53,086
Ahh mom, be careful.

605
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:56,158
Oh Sister..

606
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:57,579
We were just about to leave.

607
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,409
Are you leaving?

608
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:59,829
I forgot I have an appointment today.

609
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:03,459
You know mom never misses to go
to the bath house on Saturdays.

610
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:06,419
Mom always waited for this all week,
how could you forget...

611
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,487
Just take mom to the bath house.

612
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,440
Okay, I understand. I will take care of it.

613
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,559
The number you have dialed
is temporarily unavailable.

614
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,389
Please try sending a voicemail.

615
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,323
Try once again.

616
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,221
Hello.

617
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:26,925
Oh my God, this kid is so polite.

618
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:27,920
Yes.

619
00:29:28,881 --> 00:29:29,781
Oh!

620
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,529
Your house still don't have water right?

621
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:32,430
Yes.

622
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:35,473
We go on vacation when the water runs out.

623
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:36,957
By going to the sauna!

624
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,829
Vacation in sauna on today and tomorrow.

625
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,253
Ahh I'm so happy.

626
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,360
But.

627
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:47,129
This building of ours is
really of poor quality.

628
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:48,379
Why are you talking about that again.

629
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,280
Why?

630
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,280
Let's go!

631
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:51,950
Oh yes.

632
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:54,169
- Be careful
- Oh yes, the same.

633
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:55,513
See you later.

634
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,849
- Mom.
- Yes?

635
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,309
Daddy doesn't answer the phone.

636
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:03,519
How about I go back and get the trolley?

637
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,309
Can you do it alone?

638
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,210
Yes!

639
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:08,050
My son is all grown up.

640
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:09,510
Go Go!

641
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,948
Be careful.

642
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,090
Yes.

643
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:29,190
Damn it!

644
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,839
I'll be there after crossing the bridge.

645
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,740
Okay, Okay.

646
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,320
Yes.

647
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,550
- Please drive faster.
- Yes!

648
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,080
No.

649
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,153
This is peak time for traffic.

650
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:44,849
Ah today is Saturday?

651
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:45,750
Saturday?

652
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,925
Oh be careful!

653
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,800
 I'm hanging up,
I will arrive soon.

654
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:57,970
Mister driver

655
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:00,843
I'm sorry but I missed my bag.

656
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:03,630
Can you stop and come around once more?

657
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,869
I'll go up and come down again soon.

658
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:05,770
Sorry

659
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:09,270
I'll be back.

660
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:13,990
Damn it!

661
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:27,830
Damn it!

662
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:41,303
Excuse me, is anyone home?

663
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,593
Is there water in your house?

664
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:52,137
No one is in the house.

665
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,040
Eun-Joo.

666
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,853
Eun-Joo, my bag..

667
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,380
Eun-Joo.

668
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,506
Hello.

669
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,284
Oh good.

670
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:19,550
Su-Chan.

671
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:20,470
Yes.

672
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:24,263
If you see uncle 10 times a day,
would you still greet him?

673
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:25,730
Yes!

674
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:28,859
You are really a good boy and very polite.

675
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:32,459
I knocked on your door but
your father didn't open it.

676
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,945
My dad is sleeping.

677
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,749
Su-Chan, do you have water in your house?

678
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:37,650
No.

679
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,542
No water.

680
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:56,732
Oh damn, who's smoking on the
roof of this building? Damn it!

681
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:03,677
Wait a minute, I have to check
if the water pump is working.

682
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,450
Sorry

683
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:24,179
I've thought about it.

684
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,080
Make me crazy.

685
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,000
Not much time.

686
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,124
Hello Uncle

687
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,609
I just wanted to ask, if there's
water running in your building?

688
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:46,410
In our building there is no water.

689
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,847
Oh there's water.

690
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,369
- Ok ok.
- There's water!

691
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:53,209
Yes yes.

692
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,110
No problem.

693
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:56,210
Okay, why are you spraying me?

694
00:33:58,935 --> 00:33:59,868
Watch out mom!

695
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:25,970
Damn it!

696
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:49,330
Help!

697
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,927
Uncle call 119 119!

698
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,010
Mom.

699
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:21,789
Uncle quickly call 119

700
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:23,965
11... Call 119...

701
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,150
Yeong-Yi!!

702
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,410
Su-Chan?

703
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,280
Su-Chan!!

704
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,349
Where are you bastard?!

705
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:02,750
Bingseu, listen to me carefully now!

706
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,000
What? What?

707
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,309
I'm afraid I can't go to the wedding today.

708
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,977
- What did you say?
- I…

709
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,939
I'm sinking underground now.

710
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:12,152
Just drown forever, bitch!!

711
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:14,423
I'm really drowning asshole!!

712
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,167
119 call 119.

713
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:21,850
Oh my God, What is this?

714
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,440
What is this?!!

715
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,060
Help.

716
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,070
Please Taxi, let's go.

717
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:14,143
Let's go home. Let's go home.

718
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,987
Don't come any further.

719
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:27,590
I beg you.

720
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,060
What is this?

721
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:44,763
How come there's a taxi here?

722
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:49,725
Oh my chair!

723
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,427
Chief, please help me!

724
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:55,490
Mr. Kim?

725
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,009
What are you doing there?

726
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:57,719
I do not know.

727
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,453
Open the door, get me out!

728
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:04,809
Damn taxi, why are you driving again?!

729
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:05,809
Quick pull! pull firmly

730
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,380
I beg you!!
Pull!!

731
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:08,920
Pull hard.

732
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,050
Mr Kim?!

733
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,441
You bastard!!

734
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:16,840
Mr Kim?!

735
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,489
- What do I do?
- You killed me!!

736
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,779
Mr. Kim, don't give up!

737
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,047
Keep trying inside!

738
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:23,770
I beg you!

739
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:30,940
Mr. Kim!

740
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:32,990
Mr. Kim!

741
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:35,650
Mr. Kim!

742
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,160
This is bad!!

743
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,577
Mr. Kim, come out.

744
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,240
Thank you for real.

745
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:10,041
Help me!

746
00:40:10,987 --> 00:40:11,901
Dear??

747
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:13,690
Yeong-Yi.

748
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:18,210
Chief!!?

749
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,320
Dear??

750
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,580
Seriously! Come on quickly pick up!!

751
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,000
Eun-Joo??

752
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,013
- Are you okay?
- Yes!

753
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,620
Have you seen my family?

754
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,279
How long will it take for the SAR
Team to carry out the rescue?

755
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,947
It could take a long time.

756
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:47,539
Please evacuate the citizens immediately
and check the situation of the victims.

757
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,473
Yes I understand!

758
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,923
Damn it!!

759
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:07,246
It's done.. It worked.

760
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:12,190
Su-Chan?!!

761
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,520
We're here!

762
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:16,913
I saw it I saw it...

763
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,740
Su-Chan?

764
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,080
Who are you?

765
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,655
I saw it.

766
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:35,519
When I'm standing at the door at 502.

767
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,189
Su-Chan then left the house

768
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:40,173
I saw him take the elevator.

769
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:41,915
Then I went to the rooftop.

770
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:45,793
This incident happened in
just a few minutes.

771
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:50,153
Su-Chan must be fine.

772
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:51,660
He will be fine

773
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:54,730
thank you

774
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,020
my god.

775
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:56,829
Ah ah.

776
00:42:56,830 --> 00:42:57,730
It hurts.

777
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:59,150
Do not do it!

778
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:01,570
Seung-Tae?

779
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,066
My child?

780
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:04,610
Seung-Tae

781
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,780
Seung-Tae!

782
00:43:05,782 --> 00:43:07,129
Where did Seung-Tae go?

783
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:08,759
- Who is Seung-Tae?
- Seung-Tae!

784
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,660
Seung-Tae!!

785
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:14,886
Seung-Tae.

786
00:43:14,888 --> 00:43:15,960
This way!

787
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:19,630
Seung-Tae

788
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:22,960
Seung-Tae

789
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,180
Seung-Tae.

790
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:36,829
- Where are you?
- Seung-Tae!!

791
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:37,730
Seung-Tae.

792
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:39,190
Shoes!

793
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:41,490
Shoes!

794
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:43,110
Shoes!!

795
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:44,129
Shoes!!

796
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:44,879
Shoes?

797
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:45,780
Shoes!!

798
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:48,357
Shoes? Whose shoes?

799
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:49,719
Look at the shoes!

800
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,620
Shoes.

801
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:53,090
Shoes aren't here!

802
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:00,939
Shoes! What shoes do you mean?

803
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:02,229
My Seung-Tae's shoes.

804
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:03,899
Not in the shoe closet right now.

805
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,359
That means he went to the internet cafe

806
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,779
Seung-Tae goes to the internet cafe??

807
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,098
Means he's fine.

808
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,619
It looks like one of that...

809
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:14,682
Sinkhole.

810
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:18,377
My estimate is we're around 500 meters down.

811
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:20,579
Is it because of an earthquake or the war?

812
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:21,480
I'm certain..

813
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:22,540
It's a sinkhole.

814
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:24,089
Eun-Joo, where are you going?

815
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:26,209
Going to the top of the building,
maybe you can get a signal there.

816
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:27,943
Or maybe you'll face death.

817
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,719
Let's go together!

818
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,067
Ahh.. I won't go.
It's too dangerous.

819
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:35,049
Didn't you say the yellow
light means go on?

820
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:36,458
This is a red light.

821
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:38,372
Gotta stop.

822
00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:42,411
The foundation is unstable,
you have to be careful.

823
00:44:58,330 --> 00:44:59,530
Danger! Avalanche!

824
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:10,490
Everyone, quickly pull it quickly!!!

825
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:18,150
Quickly! you are in danger!

826
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:21,170
Climb!!

827
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:28,709
Be Careful,
It's dangerous.

828
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:31,739
Don't... don't go through there.

829
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:32,449
It's..

830
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:33,896
Dangerous there.

831
00:45:34,952 --> 00:45:36,085
Why did you come?

832
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:38,410
- I...
- Okay, you stay here!

833
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:39,289
Thank you.

834
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:40,659
Eun-Joo, you got a signal?

835
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:41,818
No!

836
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:43,119
- Keep looking!
- Yes.

837
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,453
There must be a place with a signal.

838
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:51,283
Have you ever seen anything like that?

839
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,759
I've seen something like that.

840
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,639
When?

841
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:56,707
At 9 years old..

842
00:45:56,930 --> 00:45:58,915
I once fell into a well.

843
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:00,000
Well?

844
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:01,000
Yes!

845
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,889
I crawled out by myself.

846
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:06,228
Maybe with this too.

847
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,814
Help!

848
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:10,729
- There's people down here.
- Help!

849
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:11,609
Help!

850
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:13,738
- Hello!!
- Is there anyone?

851
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:15,358
There are people here.

852
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,260
Help!!

853
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,620
Please save us!!

854
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,924
Help!!

855
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:31,608
Ouch... That's why I told you..

856
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:34,389
To go home.

857
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:37,327
Costs 80,000 but didn't want to go.

858
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:38,683
What do you mean?

859
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:40,859
Last night you know.

860
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:45,059
I want to use my car to take
you and that woman home.

861
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:47,269
Go to Anyang first then to Cheongun.

862
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:50,059
It would be 90,000 then 80,000,
Didn't I tell you?

863
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:52,396
Still says it's too expensive.

864
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:54,170
Didn't even wanted to go.

865
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:56,505
I did that?

866
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,780
No, It was your chief Mr. Park.

867
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,020
Me?

868
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,507
You don't remember?

869
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:06,401
You were so drunk.

870
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:08,604
Eighty thousand???

871
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,339
Isn't that what you said?

872
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:12,873
Did I say that Eun-Joo?

873
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:14,990
Yes.

874
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:15,910
Damn it!

875
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,434
Shut up, shut up!

876
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,907
- There are people here.
- His voice seems familiar.

877
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:33,609
Hello.

878
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:34,510
Help.

879
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:37,363
- Hey.
- Hey, isn't that Seung-Tae?

880
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:39,077
- Seung-Tae?
- Hello?

881
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:40,510
- Seung-Tae?
- Dad!!

882
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,350
I'm here.

883
00:47:42,450 --> 00:47:43,350
Wait

884
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:48,610
Seung-Tae.

885
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:52,249
What is this? Was there an earthquake?

886
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:53,294
Sinkhole.

887
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:54,919
- Sinkhole?
- Yes.

888
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,133
Didn't you go to the internet cafe?

889
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:01,759
I've stopped going there.

890
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,549
Then what were you doing on the roof?

891
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:04,469
Getting some air.

892
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:06,918
Why didn't you go to the cafe?

893
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:08,429
Didn't dad tell me not to go?

894
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:09,762
What's the matter..

895
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:12,700
That you didn't go to the internet cafe.

896
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:13,880
Why not go...

897
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:16,340
Are you hurt? My son?

898
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:18,256
Are you hurt?

899
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:22,998
Oh damn.

900
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:27,053
Then let's think about what
we should plan next.

901
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:29,279
We are now in a disaster.

902
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:33,039
First of all, we have to collect
supplies to survive.

903
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,249
Drinking water, food.

904
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:35,089
Drugs.

905
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:36,312
And a clean bed.

906
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:39,259
And we have to let the outside
know that we're still alive.

907
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:41,719
We have to stand here and count one by one.

908
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,219
If we find movement above.

909
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,469
We send a signal with a flashlight.

910
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:45,969
How can you understand
a situation like this?

911
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:48,570
I learned from Brother Chris on YouTube.

912
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,000
Really weird.

913
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:55,059
What is it?

914
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:56,993
He shouldn't know any brother.

915
00:48:57,650 --> 00:48:59,399
I don't think he goes to the
internet cafe all day.

916
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,200
He's at home and just surfing the internet.

917
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:04,497
Maybe a foreign friend.

918
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,409
He can't speak English,
where are foreign friends from?

919
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:11,010
We better find a way out.

920
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:17,379
It is currently very dangerous
near the scene.

921
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:19,629
It's hard for us to verify the
situation inside the sinkhole.

922
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:21,549
But later after evacuating the citizens.

923
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:23,719
We will try to enter the sinkhole.

924
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,320
Please everyone trust us.

925
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:27,177
Please be patient waiting.

926
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:29,953
Please take care of it sir.

927
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:32,423
Ok we will try our best.

928
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:38,939
Then let's check the list of family
members buried in the ground.

929
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:40,707
Please say one by one

930
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:43,519
Lee Seung-Hoon is 10 years old.

931
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:44,740
This is No. 202

932
00:49:45,410 --> 00:49:46,310
501

933
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,897
Park Dong-Won is 37 years old...

934
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:08,348
I'm sorry Mr. Kim.

935
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:13,527
Eun-Joo too, I'm sorry.

936
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:22,812
I shouldn't have asked you to
come to the house warming.

937
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:27,164
I never thought I would die in
your house ever in my life.

938
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:29,789
What's wrong with you thinking about dying?

939
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,499
I have struggled for 11 years to buy this house
and it became like this in just 2 weeks.

940
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:36,669
Even I don't want to die,
So don't even think about dying

941
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:38,603
I really didn't want to think.

942
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,917
But there's these images of
death in my mind.

943
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:46,589
You should think about Hyo-Jeong.

944
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:47,718
You like that, don't you?

945
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,124
What's the point of liking her?

946
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:53,719
Isn't she currently dating Jung?

947
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:56,019
It's not like they're getting married.

948
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,979
Better to just confess
if you come out later.

949
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:00,330
Didn't you also hear that Mr. Jung
had bought an apartment?

950
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:02,939
While I live in one room.

951
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:04,207
Really incomparable.

952
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:06,569
Hey, can't you also buy an apartment?

953
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:08,910
Didn't everyone say it was
valued at 200 million?

954
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:14,560
I really don't want to repeat
I..

955
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,120
I'm really thinking of dying!!

956
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,033
I also live in one room.

957
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:25,617
So who lives in one room can't get married?

958
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,049
One room can be two rooms.

959
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:28,896
Two rooms can also be three rooms.

960
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,667
Of course, Eun-Joo is right.

961
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,099
Look at me, I used to live in one room.

962
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:34,269
Isn't it three rooms now?

963
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:36,746
Didn't you say you've been fighting
for 11 years? 11 years…!

964
00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:40,343
In addition to the 3 rooms, you now...

965
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:54,230
Hey Seung-Tae

966
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:55,440
Seung-Tae.

967
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,249
What are you doing?

968
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:58,289
I'm looking for something.

969
00:51:58,290 --> 00:51:59,749
Let's get out soon, something's falling.

970
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:00,619
Quickly!

971
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:01,553
Okay I'll come.

972
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:25,420
Damn it!

973
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:29,060
Damn, look at this.

974
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,150
What is this.

975
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:38,463
EVACUATION BUS FOR THE VICTIMS' FAMILY

976
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,499
Why didn't the Rescue Team people come?

977
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:25,919
Can't believe a day has passed.

978
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,853
Not even one has shown up yet.

979
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:31,089
They should know that we are still alive.

980
00:53:31,090 --> 00:53:32,357
Of course they know.

981
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:35,610
Please calm down and be patient waiting.

982
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:38,117
Discard the expired.

983
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:42,769
Does it matter now about
the expiration date?

984
00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:44,312
Mr. Kim, you are so sensitive.

985
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:46,789
I will have diarrhea if I eat expired food.

986
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:51,237
Around 10:50 this morning

987
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,145
in Changsin-dong, of Seoul.

988
00:53:53,147 --> 00:53:56,369
The phenomenon of underlying caves collapse,
Namely a sinkhole occurred.

989
00:53:56,370 --> 00:54:00,539
So far, the accident has caused a building
to collapse to the bottom of the sinkhole.

990
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:03,459
The cause of the incident was the
subsidence of the foundation.

991
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:05,127
Thus causing ground shear.

992
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:08,063
The newly completed building, collapsed.

993
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:11,657
We are currently investigating the disaster

994
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:13,919
32 people were slightly injured

995
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,187
7 seriously injured.

996
00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:20,230
The injured are currently being taken to 11 hospitals
including Yonsei University Hospital...

997
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:35,606
What I'm afraid of down there is
what if they can't eat anything.

998
00:54:40,990 --> 00:54:41,890
What's this?

999
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,079
Roast turkey!

1000
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,420
Let's eat.

1001
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:16,423
Hey number 501, wait a minute.

1002
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,220
Eat!

1003
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:22,680
Eat.

1004
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:26,837
Here you go number 501.

1005
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:28,820
Eat.

1006
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:35,280
Let's eat.

1007
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:47,088
Isn't that the new rocking
chair that you bought?

1008
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:50,130
Yes.

1009
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,274
I always thought I should buy good
furniture when I have my own house.

1010
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:59,102
To not use the type of furniture that
is damaged by moving around.

1011
00:55:59,911 --> 00:56:02,571
I've always wanted a piece of furniture
that can be passed on to my children.

1012
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:04,813
You can buy it again later.

1013
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:06,837
But now I have no home.

1014
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:10,976
The rain doesn't stop.

1015
00:56:12,130 --> 00:56:13,523
It keeps raining.

1016
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:20,226
Hey, don't worry.

1017
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:21,713
Wait a little longer

1018
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:23,210
119 is coming.

1019
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:29,320
Mr. Kim is not married yet, right?

1020
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:31,174
Yes.

1021
00:56:31,770 --> 00:56:32,768
Don't do it.

1022
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:35,577
I can't get married.

1023
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:37,729
I don't have a house.

1024
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:38,930
And have no future.

1025
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:42,315
Mr. Park, I envied you when
you bought a house.

1026
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:44,570
Did you buy it?

1027
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,409
You bought this house?

1028
00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:47,239
Yes.

1029
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:48,440
What is the price?

1030
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,106
390 million.

1031
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:53,442
It didn't take that long to go up.

1032
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:57,249
How much did you buy yours for?

1033
00:56:58,130 --> 00:56:59,179
I only rent.

1034
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:01,280
Deposit 30 million and rent
800,000 per month.

1035
00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:04,819
Oh it's so cold.

1036
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:06,508
Where is firewood?

1037
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:07,469
Ah there is a lot of
firewood here.

1038
00:57:07,470 --> 00:57:09,349
Hey you guys, let's pull the wood out.

1039
00:57:09,350 --> 00:57:11,269
There's a lot of firewood here.

1040
00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:12,170
Come on.

1041
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,229
Use this broken chair, let me destroy it.

1042
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:15,109
To be used as firewood.

1043
00:57:15,110 --> 00:57:16,177
Come on, quickly.

1044
00:57:17,070 --> 00:57:19,192
Oh so much.

1045
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:21,367
Why is this so strong?

1046
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:25,193
Why can't I destroy it?

1047
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,369
What is wrong with it?

1048
00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:14,970
Maybe the signal is weak.

1049
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:17,940
This is a big problem

1050
00:58:34,643 --> 00:58:35,945
119

1051
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:36,979
Dad!

1052
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:37,880
119 here.

1053
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:40,880
Daddy 119

1054
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,220
119 here

1055
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:43,180
119?

1056
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,467
Hey 119 is here 119.

1057
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:48,069
Come out fast.

1058
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:48,970
Team 119

1059
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,280
119 is here 119

1060
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:53,770
119

1061
00:58:54,787 --> 00:58:55,928
Where's 119?

1062
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:56,749
Here!

1063
00:58:56,750 --> 00:58:57,650
Here.

1064
00:58:58,670 --> 00:58:59,539
Where?

1065
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:00,709
Where? Where? Where?

1066
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:01,610
Is this 119?

1067
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:02,839
It says 119 on it

1068
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:03,629
119 119

1069
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:04,259
We are saved!

1070
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:05,160
Saved!!

1071
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:06,549
It fell from above.

1072
00:59:06,550 --> 00:59:08,009
The signal in this place must
be relatively weak.

1073
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:09,290
Can't be perfect.

1074
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:12,058
Ahh isn't there a big hole up there.

1075
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:13,429
Why is there no signal?

1076
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:15,809
When we are in tunnels and mountains,
sometimes there is no signal.

1077
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:17,479
We are at 250 meters from the ground above.

1078
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:18,519
Of course there will be no signal.

1079
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:19,899
Can the camera still be used?

1080
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:21,780
Everyone, help us.

1081
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:23,778
We're stuck here.

1082
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:25,189
My name is Kim Seung-Hyeon.

1083
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:26,489
- Come help us
- Help me!

1084
00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:27,390
We're here…

1085
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:28,279
Is that yours?

1086
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:29,069
You don't need to know.

1087
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:30,199
Why so much money?

1088
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,100
Watch out!!

1089
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:39,110
Go there.

1090
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,020
Quick.

1091
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:43,620
Come here quickly!

1092
00:59:51,010 --> 00:59:51,759
Go there.

1093
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:52,827
Over here.

1094
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:06,470
Mr. Kim!

1095
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:16,020
Mr. Kim!

1096
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:18,810
Help me.

1097
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:20,119
Where?

1098
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:21,020
Mr. Kim!

1099
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:30,259
Don't go, don't...

1100
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:31,527
Eun-Ju, don't go...

1101
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:52,101
Eun-Joo, don't dodge the rocks!

1102
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:08,860
Catch!!

1103
01:01:23,310 --> 01:01:25,094
Mr. Park please help me pull the rope!!

1104
01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:28,779
Mister!

1105
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:29,680
Help me.

1106
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:45,789
Chief, please pull the rope.

1107
01:01:45,790 --> 01:01:46,690
Help! help.

1108
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:50,780
Help me.

1109
01:01:56,090 --> 01:01:56,990
Mr. Kim!

1110
01:01:57,358 --> 01:01:58,439
I'm coming.

1111
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:00,165
Wait a bit.

1112
01:02:00,310 --> 01:02:03,310
There's nothing to wait
for you bastards...!!

1113
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:04,500
Pull strongly.

1114
01:02:07,150 --> 01:02:08,050
Keep pulling.

1115
01:02:08,610 --> 01:02:10,439
It must be pulled at the same time.

1116
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:11,340
Pull.

1117
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:12,720
Same time.

1118
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:21,064
Keep going!

1119
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:28,117
Help! help.

1120
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:26,500
It hurts.

1121
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:28,300
My feet...

1122
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:30,960
Eun-Joo, hold tightly.

1123
01:03:48,330 --> 01:03:49,230
Dad!!

1124
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,249
It's okay, dad is fine.

1125
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:52,150
Dad!

1126
01:03:53,950 --> 01:03:54,850
Do not move!

1127
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:56,022
Don't drown.

1128
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:57,089
Dad.

1129
01:03:57,090 --> 01:03:58,509
It's okay, dad is fine.

1130
01:03:58,510 --> 01:03:59,410
Its okay.

1131
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:02,657
- Dad!
- Do not!

1132
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:03,910
Dad.

1133
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,380
Dad

1134
01:04:10,802 --> 01:04:12,069
Seung-Tae, let go!!

1135
01:04:25,990 --> 01:04:26,890
Seung-Tae

1136
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:29,650
Seung-Tae.

1137
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:32,730
- Look at me!!
- Dad.

1138
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:33,690
Brother!!

1139
01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:39,030
Keep standing.

1140
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:40,591
Raise your head

1141
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:42,493
Seung-Tae raise your head!

1142
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,083
Oh my son

1143
01:04:47,970 --> 01:04:50,341
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1144
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:53,469
Dad.

1145
01:04:55,230 --> 01:04:56,130
Dad.

1146
01:04:58,440 --> 01:04:59,340
Dad.

1147
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:08,924
Dad, Dad.

1148
01:05:12,092 --> 01:05:12,992
Follow me!!

1149
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:26,080
Brother!!

1150
01:05:28,310 --> 01:05:29,210
Seung-Tae!!

1151
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:37,797
Are you alright?

1152
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:40,800
Wake up!!

1153
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:44,109
Get up!!

1154
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:45,710
Seung-Tae, are you okay?

1155
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:49,640
Wake up!!

1156
01:05:49,642 --> 01:05:50,542
Seung-Tae

1157
01:05:54,170 --> 01:05:55,862
Seung-Tae where is he?

1158
01:05:55,864 --> 01:05:56,764
Seung-Tae...

1159
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:59,669
Seung-Tae wake up, Seung-Tae wake up!!

1160
01:05:59,670 --> 01:06:00,669
Seung-Tae wake up!

1161
01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:01,870
Are you all right?

1162
01:06:01,970 --> 01:06:02,870
Seung-Tae!!

1163
01:06:03,011 --> 01:06:04,211
Seung-Tae wake up!

1164
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:05,990
Are you okay?

1165
01:06:20,570 --> 01:06:22,189
We are temporarily securing
the building with chains.

1166
01:06:22,190 --> 01:06:23,954
But the probability of collapsing
is still very high.

1167
01:06:26,910 --> 01:06:28,310
Isn't that our drone?

1168
01:06:30,790 --> 01:06:31,858
Let's get it!

1169
01:06:45,470 --> 01:06:46,679
He's an employee of my husband's company

1170
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:48,733
Hong Eun-Joo, Kim Seong-Hoon.

1171
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:59,146
Why is my Seong-hun not there?

1172
01:07:01,270 --> 01:07:02,170
That is it.

1173
01:07:04,610 --> 01:07:06,210
How about my Seong-Hoon?

1174
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:07,180
I'm sorry.

1175
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:09,127
This is all we have

1176
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:11,386
Seung-Hoon...

1177
01:07:12,740 --> 01:07:13,640
No!!

1178
01:07:14,870 --> 01:07:15,770
Mr. Seo.

1179
01:07:16,580 --> 01:07:21,268
My husband and Su-Chan
don't seem to be together.

1180
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:24,003
Please look for them.

1181
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:30,013
You said Su-Chan was holding
your phone, right?

1182
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:31,540
Yes.

1183
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:36,320
What are people living for?

1184
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:39,820
I'm just busy with the shop.

1185
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:43,463
Can't even give my Seong-Hoon..

1186
01:07:44,070 --> 01:07:46,135
Hot food every day.

1187
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:54,427
What's my life for?

1188
01:07:59,710 --> 01:08:01,510
If Seung-Hoon can be saved,

1189
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:05,804
I will close the shop

1190
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,719
and will always be by his side.

1191
01:08:13,220 --> 01:08:15,375
I have to do that.

1192
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:34,587
We've tracked the phone's location.

1193
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:37,496
Su-Chan's phone...

1194
01:08:38,710 --> 01:08:40,243
The last location was..

1195
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:45,692
at the residency building.

1196
01:08:53,890 --> 01:08:55,357
How could this happen?

1197
01:08:59,350 --> 01:09:00,229
How could that be?

1198
01:09:00,230 --> 01:09:01,130
Good grief.

1199
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:05,300
But…

1200
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:10,110
This sinkhole disaster still
has its benefits.

1201
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:12,100
What?

1202
01:09:13,530 --> 01:09:16,243
It's rare to see Seung-Tae sleeping
at my house like that.

1203
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:20,996
Thank you 501.

1204
01:09:26,170 --> 01:09:28,799
I will repay for this in the future.

1205
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:32,067
At least you should come out
alive to repay later

1206
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:36,639
119 sending drones explains what?
They know what's going on.

1207
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:39,440
They know we're stuck here without nothing.

1208
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:43,349
By the way, are the people living
in this building all right?

1209
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:44,314
Do not worry

1210
01:09:44,730 --> 01:09:46,883
I've been around in the morning.

1211
01:09:47,270 --> 01:09:49,003
Maybe due to lack of water.

1212
01:09:49,030 --> 01:09:51,188
There's was no one at any home.

1213
01:09:51,190 --> 01:09:52,090
Really?

1214
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:55,727
That's really good.

1215
01:09:56,870 --> 01:09:58,805
I was worried about them.

1216
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:11,633
Is that your mother?

1217
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:24,189
Eun-Joo, did you have any
difficulties at the company?

1218
01:10:24,190 --> 01:10:25,559
Let me know if any.

1219
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:26,880
Is that so?

1220
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:35,093
Doesn't the company send gifts
home during the holidays?

1221
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:37,427
I want to send it to my parents

1222
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:40,413
I've never sent them to this day.

1223
01:10:44,250 --> 01:10:45,326
I will try...

1224
01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:02,079
Do you want to listen to
music or take a selfie?

1225
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:04,087
Let's take a selfie.

1226
01:11:26,860 --> 01:11:28,288
This news just in.

1227
01:11:28,290 --> 01:11:32,423
It has been confirmed that there
are survivors in the sinkhole.

1228
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:36,169
Meanwhile the local rescue operation confirmed
that there were more survivors.

1229
01:11:36,170 --> 01:11:39,412
Also doing their best to seek and save.

1230
01:11:39,470 --> 01:11:41,469
But there is danger of a
next possible collapse.

1231
01:11:41,470 --> 01:11:43,179
And it is expected that there
will be heavy rain tonight.

1232
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:46,939
Will increase the difficulty
of search and rescue.

1233
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:50,501
Now we know there are
survivors in the sinkhole.

1234
01:11:50,650 --> 01:11:52,609
But if another standing building
comes crashing down.

1235
01:11:52,610 --> 01:11:54,399
Then something big will happen.

1236
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,137
How can you say that?

1237
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:59,817
Who would agree to blow up a nice building?

1238
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:02,715
Again, we won't blow it up.

1239
01:12:03,346 --> 01:12:06,075
The concrete collapse below.

1240
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:08,789
It then moves the center of gravity in the
opposite direction from the sinkhole.

1241
01:12:08,790 --> 01:12:12,709
If we don't do this, your homes will
all sink into the sinkhole.

1242
01:12:12,710 --> 01:12:14,089
Do you want to save only them?

1243
01:12:14,090 --> 01:12:14,990
How about us?

1244
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:16,601
We have to live too.

1245
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:17,844
Is it right??

1246
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:18,969
Of course.

1247
01:12:19,630 --> 01:12:21,230
If we continue like this.

1248
01:12:21,590 --> 01:12:23,469
We will never reach an agreement.

1249
01:12:23,470 --> 01:12:24,219
Right?

1250
01:12:24,220 --> 01:12:25,925
Of course I don't agree.

1251
01:12:25,927 --> 01:12:26,827
Do not agree…

1252
01:12:32,980 --> 01:12:34,063
There is no way to agree.

1253
01:12:34,065 --> 01:12:36,563
Let me say something.

1254
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:41,739
I saw someone on the roof of that building.

1255
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:45,140
He was looking at me all throguhout
when it happend.

1256
01:12:45,490 --> 01:12:47,291
When I looked at him

1257
01:12:47,370 --> 01:12:49,369
I was going crazy.

1258
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:54,166
It took me 20 years to buy this house.

1259
01:12:56,090 --> 01:12:59,552
But... if now I don't agree.

1260
01:13:00,590 --> 01:13:02,751
I will definitely be cursed.

1261
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,150
I agree sir.

1262
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:17,649
Are the satellite phones
and rescue items ready?

1263
01:13:17,650 --> 01:13:19,863
We're still looking for a parachute
It takes time sir.

1264
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:21,359
Hey, it's going to rain soon.

1265
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:22,260
Be quick.

1266
01:13:22,410 --> 01:13:23,310
Yes sir!!

1267
01:13:31,710 --> 01:13:32,610
Lower.

1268
01:13:56,270 --> 01:13:58,337
Take it, son, isn't this yours?

1269
01:13:58,610 --> 01:14:00,143
Can't even go to school.

1270
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:03,003
Although earn so much without buying books.

1271
01:14:04,030 --> 01:14:05,112
Take it.

1272
01:14:09,450 --> 01:14:10,350
Hey Seung-Tae.

1273
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:12,783
Can I ask me something?

1274
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:14,230
Yes.

1275
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:16,299
What are you saving that money for?

1276
01:14:17,670 --> 01:14:19,690
My dream is to have a hundred million won.

1277
01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:22,596
Your dream? 100 million won?

1278
01:14:23,090 --> 01:14:23,759
Yes.

1279
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,479
If you got it? What do you want to do next?

1280
01:14:27,010 --> 01:14:27,910
I do not know.

1281
01:14:28,033 --> 01:14:29,002
Ahh this kid.

1282
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:31,641
So boring oh my god.

1283
01:14:34,350 --> 01:14:35,250
Hey Seung-Tae

1284
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:36,960
look at that.

1285
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:42,813
That dream... is like that star.

1286
01:14:43,610 --> 01:14:45,767
Very far away.

1287
01:14:47,110 --> 01:14:50,541
Dad, it seems to be getting closer.

1288
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:53,329
What do you mean close?

1289
01:14:53,330 --> 01:14:54,930
Are you drunk right now?

1290
01:14:55,834 --> 01:14:56,734
What's this?

1291
01:14:57,254 --> 01:14:59,588
What's this? Is it a shooting star?

1292
01:15:00,670 --> 01:15:02,636
We are saved, we are saved.

1293
01:15:03,510 --> 01:15:06,110
It is now clear that 119 is coming soon

1294
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:07,653
thank you Lord.

1295
01:15:28,070 --> 01:15:29,737
Ahh the water is so sweet.

1296
01:15:29,910 --> 01:15:30,529
What's this?

1297
01:15:30,530 --> 01:15:31,989
Isn't this a satellite phone?

1298
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:33,057
There's a signal.

1299
01:15:34,370 --> 01:15:35,316
Can we call?

1300
01:15:42,380 --> 01:15:43,280
Mom!!

1301
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:46,104
Mom.

1302
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:48,830
Why wasn't that my mom?

1303
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:50,080
How come.

1304
01:15:51,050 --> 01:15:52,120
Not your mother?

1305
01:15:52,390 --> 01:15:53,534
It was a man speaking.

1306
01:15:54,310 --> 01:15:56,292
Eun-Joo, try calling home.

1307
01:15:58,310 --> 01:15:59,402
It's alright.

1308
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,559
They will worry even more if I call now.

1309
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,222
Can make them sadder

1310
01:16:04,572 --> 01:16:06,772
I'll go up and meet them directly.

1311
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:19,150
Seo-Jeon.

1312
01:16:20,210 --> 01:16:23,847
Um, It's me Manager Kim and
Eun-Joo, we're doing well.

1313
01:16:23,849 --> 01:16:25,325
Thank you for worrying about me.

1314
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:27,560
Seo-Jeon, I want to tell you something.

1315
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:32,593
We have that gift event for
Chuseok next month.

1316
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:35,622
Add Eun-Joos' name for that too.

1317
01:16:37,930 --> 01:16:40,019
Can it be something like ribs?
Korean beef...

1318
01:16:40,020 --> 01:16:41,555
Don't forget to print the company name

1319
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:42,960
thank you.

1320
01:16:49,464 --> 01:16:50,800
Here 501.

1321
01:16:51,030 --> 01:16:52,963
Call Su-Chan's mother quickly.

1322
01:16:56,540 --> 01:16:57,239
What is it?

1323
01:16:57,240 --> 01:16:59,329
- Quick answer, answer!
- What's this?

1324
01:16:59,330 --> 01:16:59,722
Hello.

1325
01:16:59,724 --> 01:17:02,171
This is from the search and rescue
center can you hear us?

1326
01:17:03,511 --> 01:17:04,411
thank you.

1327
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,973
Yes, my name is Park Dong-Won.

1328
01:17:07,210 --> 01:17:08,959
There's five of us who survived.

1329
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:10,049
Is everyone safe?

1330
01:17:10,050 --> 01:17:10,969
Has anyone been hurt?

1331
01:17:10,970 --> 01:17:13,502
Yes... everyone is fine.

1332
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:15,494
I have to go in.

1333
01:17:16,260 --> 01:17:17,309
I have to save my son.

1334
01:17:17,310 --> 01:17:18,269
Park Dong-Won's wife!

1335
01:17:18,270 --> 01:17:19,059
We will arrive in an hour.

1336
01:17:19,060 --> 01:17:20,389
No, in less than 30 minutes down there.

1337
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:21,923
Su-Chan is down there!!

1338
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:25,420
Yeong-Yi??

1339
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:29,279
Didn't Su-Chan go to the
supermarket with you?

1340
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:31,593
Su-Chan took my phone.

1341
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:34,312
The last location was in that building.

1342
01:17:34,660 --> 01:17:37,023
Dear, Su-Chan is down there.

1343
01:17:38,870 --> 01:17:42,119
You said you saw my son Su-Chan get
on the elevator and get out, right?

1344
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:44,587
Yes, right! Is there something wrong?

1345
01:17:44,710 --> 01:17:46,629
- My child is missing.
- What?

1346
01:17:46,630 --> 01:17:48,163
He didn't go to his mom.

1347
01:17:48,340 --> 01:17:49,719
What are you saying?

1348
01:17:50,010 --> 01:17:52,329
I... I saw it clearly.

1349
01:17:52,420 --> 01:17:54,009
Park Dong-Won! Park Dong-won!!

1350
01:17:54,010 --> 01:17:55,299
You have to find your son.

1351
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:57,367
You have do it before the flood.

1352
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:06,920
Mom.

1353
01:18:36,260 --> 01:18:37,160
Chief.

1354
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:40,540
Be careful.

1355
01:18:46,810 --> 01:18:47,710
Slowly.

1356
01:18:48,110 --> 01:18:49,010
Hang tight.

1357
01:18:50,150 --> 01:18:51,050
Slowly.

1358
01:18:59,030 --> 01:19:01,184
Are you all right Mr. 501?

1359
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:03,940
Yes.

1360
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:07,748
There's a cover on top of it.

1361
01:19:07,750 --> 01:19:08,650
Open it.

1362
01:19:12,670 --> 01:19:13,670
Did you see it?

1363
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:14,780
Yes!

1364
01:19:38,410 --> 01:19:39,310
Lower.

1365
01:19:57,130 --> 01:19:58,009
It's collapsing!

1366
01:19:58,010 --> 01:19:58,882
The building is collapsing!

1367
01:19:58,884 --> 01:20:00,506
Raise!

1368
01:20:24,950 --> 01:20:26,039
Seung-Tae, go inside quickly!

1369
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:26,869
What about dad?

1370
01:20:26,870 --> 01:20:28,203
Dad has to hold this.

1371
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:29,749
Go in, hurry up! tell Seung-Tae to come in

1372
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:30,650
Seung-Tae come on!!

1373
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:56,300
Su-Chan!?

1374
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:57,260
Dad!

1375
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:00,450
Dad!

1376
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:21,653
Seung-Hoon let's go together!

1377
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:27,580
Seung-Hoon!

1378
01:21:29,810 --> 01:21:31,749
Seung-Hoon let's go together

1379
01:21:32,230 --> 01:21:33,771
Seung-Hoon

1380
01:21:34,650 --> 01:21:36,114
Seung-Hoon.

1381
01:21:44,870 --> 01:21:46,137
Where is the chief?

1382
01:21:46,990 --> 01:21:47,890
Under.

1383
01:21:49,660 --> 01:21:53,667
I failed to.. keep hold of the rope.

1384
01:21:56,590 --> 01:21:57,790
How could that be?

1385
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:05,160
Su-Chan.

1386
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:35,400
Su-Chan!!

1387
01:22:44,510 --> 01:22:45,410
Su-Chan.

1388
01:22:46,890 --> 01:22:47,790
Su-Chan.

1389
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:51,000
Su-Chan.

1390
01:22:53,350 --> 01:22:54,250
Su-Chan.

1391
01:23:02,150 --> 01:23:04,028
Su-Chan dad here!!

1392
01:23:04,037 --> 01:23:06,030
Dad.

1393
01:23:06,860 --> 01:23:07,760
Su-Chan.

1394
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:11,180
Su-Chan.

1395
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:20,534
Su-Chan!?

1396
01:23:21,670 --> 01:23:23,394
Dad.

1397
01:23:23,420 --> 01:23:24,553
Dad will save you.

1398
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:27,740
Dad.

1399
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:32,540
Su-Chan.

1400
01:23:33,350 --> 01:23:35,723
Dad.

1401
01:23:46,990 --> 01:23:48,604
Su-Chan, are you okay?

1402
01:23:49,450 --> 01:23:50,964
My son, are you okay?

1403
01:23:51,620 --> 01:23:53,550
Where's mom?

1404
01:23:53,790 --> 01:23:59,409
Mom?! mom is waiting for you at home.

1405
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:05,807
Su-Chan, let's go home.

1406
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:07,342
Let's go home.

1407
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:11,740
Where's Seung-Hoon?

1408
01:24:13,510 --> 01:24:14,445
Seung Hoon?

1409
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:25,724
Grandma?

1410
01:24:43,090 --> 01:24:46,322
Thank you, is grandma okay?

1411
01:24:48,510 --> 01:24:50,275
My son is not doing well.

1412
01:24:51,432 --> 01:24:52,171
What?

1413
01:26:24,350 --> 01:26:25,250
Grandma.

1414
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:10,710
Grandma, you have to come with me.

1415
01:27:15,450 --> 01:27:17,221
You all go.

1416
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:23,049
Come with us please.

1417
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:27,820
Grandma.

1418
01:27:34,170 --> 01:27:35,419
How is the situation now?

1419
01:27:35,420 --> 01:27:37,878
Everywhere has collapsed and
the water has flooded in.

1420
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:43,960
Chief.

1421
01:28:41,110 --> 01:28:42,526
Sorry Seng-Hoon.

1422
01:28:44,740 --> 01:28:45,849
Sorry.

1423
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:51,959
Uncle can't take you to your mother's side.

1424
01:29:04,010 --> 01:29:06,725
You have to live

1425
01:29:07,930 --> 01:29:09,412
I'm sorry grandma

1426
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:18,142
Seung-Hoon.

1427
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:38,873
Su-Chan let's go to mom.

1428
01:30:23,010 --> 01:30:24,750
Su-Chan, hold tight to dad.

1429
01:30:25,180 --> 01:30:26,080
Yes.

1430
01:30:39,150 --> 01:30:40,069
Su-Chan, are you okay?

1431
01:30:40,190 --> 01:30:41,090
Dad.

1432
01:30:42,190 --> 01:30:43,109
Hold on to dad.

1433
01:30:43,110 --> 01:30:44,010
Yes.

1434
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:07,124
What sound is that?

1435
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:05,300
We're here!

1436
01:32:07,110 --> 01:32:08,010
Chief?

1437
01:32:19,370 --> 01:32:20,270

1451
01:33:19,730 --> 01:33:21,139
- Hold on!

1452
01:33:21,140 --> 01:33:22,152
Manager Kim.

1453
01:33:23,190 --> 01:33:24,090
Su-Chan!

1454
01:33:24,810 --> 01:33:26,498
- Come here.
- Su-Chan, are you okay?

1455
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:27,900
Chief Park, come here.

1456
01:33:30,700 --> 01:33:32,233
Be careful of your head.

1457
01:33:32,490 --> 01:33:33,319
Su-Chan.

1458
01:33:33,320 --> 01:33:34,220
Oh Lord.

1459
01:33:34,370 --> 01:33:35,270
Quickly.

1460
01:33:37,790 --> 01:33:38,740
Su-Chan, are you okay?

1461
01:33:39,620 --> 01:33:40,329
Okay?

1462
01:33:40,330 --> 01:33:41,516
Hello

1463
01:33:41,518 --> 01:33:42,418
are you okay?

1464
01:33:43,580 --> 01:33:44,844
Help us.

1465
01:33:45,935 --> 01:33:46,835
Hold him.

1466
01:33:47,715 --> 01:33:48,615
Be careful.

1467
01:33:51,970 --> 01:33:53,179
Ahh you're still alive.

1468
01:33:53,180 --> 01:33:54,398
Chief! Chief!

1469
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:57,437
- You are safe! you are alive!
- Good Work.

1470
01:33:57,680 --> 01:33:59,218
Good work.

1471
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:03,613
Hurry up, it's starting to flood.

1472
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:36,920
Ohh look above...
Why is there a building above?

1473
01:34:38,470 --> 01:34:39,956
Will it fall later?

1474
01:34:41,140 --> 01:34:42,413
I see it moving.

1475
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:49,347
The water seems to be rising.

1476
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:50,600
What should we do?

1477
01:34:51,940 --> 01:34:53,537
What should we do about this?

1478
01:35:02,330 --> 01:35:03,229
This!

1479
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:04,709
This!

1480
01:35:04,710 --> 01:35:05,610
Use this.

1481
01:35:07,250 --> 01:35:09,429
Bring everything that can float.

1482
01:35:09,670 --> 01:35:10,609
Come search!

1483
01:35:10,647 --> 01:35:11,780
The floating ones.

1484
01:35:12,420 --> 01:35:13,320
Here.

1485
01:35:19,429 --> 01:35:20,329

01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:35,007
Seung-Tae, look again!!

1488
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:21,099
Look what mister brought!

1489

All of you, get up here.

1490
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:24,180
Come on!

1491
01:36:25,290 --> 01:36:27,748
Mister, this is that!

1492
01:36:27,750 --> 01:36:28,817
Yellow Submarine.

1493
01:36:29,210 --> 01:36:31,989
The Beatles' Yellow Submarine.

1494
01:36:35,250 --> 01:36:37,606
Dad? where is the lid?

1495
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:38,660
Lid?

1496
01:36:39,090 --> 01:36:40,864
Has anyone seen the lid?

1497
01:36:41,937 --> 01:36:42,837
Lid?

1498
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:44,696
That's it.

1499
01:36:44,890 --> 01:36:46,063
Is that it?

1500
01:36:50,534 --> 01:36:51,906
Try closing it.

1501
01:36:56,440 --> 01:36:57,895
It fits!!

1502
01:36:57,897 --> 01:36:59,356
Yes.

1503
01:37:00,860 --> 01:37:02,529
No. 501, let Su-Chan go first.

1504
01:37:02,530 --> 01:37:03,051
Ok.

1505
01:37:03,053 --> 01:37:04,053
Eun-Jjoo go up!

1506
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:09,020
Su-Chan.

1507
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:10,869
Manager Kim.

1508
01:37:10,870 --> 01:37:11,770
Yes.

1509
01:37:17,090 --> 01:37:17,956
Be careful.

1510
01:37:17,958 --> 01:37:18,858
Dad.

1511
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:21,653
Go on, quickly.

1512
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:22,620
Get in

1513
01:37:23,300 --> 01:37:24,200

1514
01:37:35,110 --> 01:37:36,010
Hurry up.

1515
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:39,180
Be careful

1516
01:37:40,570 --> 01:37:41,791

1517
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:44,260
Come on chief.

1518
01:37:49,870 --> 01:37:51,248
Brother, come on in.

1519
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:52,248
Dad, climb in

1520
01:37:52,250 --> 01:37:54,654
I'll come back quickly.

1521
01:37:55,630 --> 01:37:56,530
What?

1522
01:37:56,630 --> 01:37:58,786
Whose going to close it
after if we all went up?

1523
01:38:01,562 --> 01:38:02,462
Dad!!

1524
01:38:03,510 --> 01:38:04,339
Dad.

1525
01:38:04,340 --> 01:38:05,240
Brother!!

1526
01:38:05,260 --> 01:38:06,160
Mister.

1527
01:38:06,350 --> 01:38:07,250
Dad.

1528
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:11,460
Mister

1529
01:38:11,462 --> 01:38:14,605
Seung-Tae, dad will catch up.

1530
01:38:15,033 --> 01:38:17,160
- Dad!!
- Mister.

1531
01:38:18,780 --> 01:38:19,399
Dad.

1532
01:38:19,401 --> 01:38:20,527
Dad.

1533
01:38:20,529 --> 01:38:22,839
- Uncle
- Mister.

1534
01:38:23,456 --> 01:38:24,285
Brother.

1535
01:38:24,287 --> 01:38:25,187
Mister.

1536
01:38:41,131 --> 01:38:43,175
- Mister
- Brother.

1537
01:38:43,365 --> 01:38:44,265
Dad.

1538
01:38:44,380 --> 01:38:45,280
Brother!

1539
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:46,018
Dad.

1540
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:46,920
Mister.

1541
01:38:47,843 --> 01:38:48,743
Dad…

1542
01:38:52,930 --> 01:38:53,830
Dad.

1543
01:38:58,060 --> 01:38:58,960
Dad!!

1544
01:39:03,372 --> 01:39:05,263
Open the lid!

1545
01:39:07,070 --> 01:39:07,970
Dad.

1546
01:39:57,460 --> 01:39:59,458
Su-Chan, are you okay?

1547
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:01,060
Seung-Tae, are you okay?

1548
01:40:10,180 --> 01:40:11,854
It seems to be tangled in something.

1549
01:40:13,430 --> 01:40:14,563
It's okay Su-Chan.

1550
01:40:20,350 --> 01:40:21,417
We have to push!

1551
01:40:29,990 --> 01:40:30,890
Jump!

1552
01:40:30,892 --> 01:40:31,792
Jump.

1553
01:40:54,850 --> 01:40:55,880
It's going up.

1554
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:07,622
Eun-Joo push!!

1555
01:41:07,860 --> 01:41:09,987
- Push Eunjoo hard!!
- What do we do??

1556
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:33,820
Keep pushing!!

1557
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:46,811
Take it out!!

1558
01:43:26,290 --> 01:43:27,581
What is this?

1559
01:43:32,268 --> 01:43:34,428
Water is coming inside.

1560
01:43:35,391 --> 01:43:36,725
Its leaking!!

1561
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:46,027
Is there anyone there?

1562
01:43:46,060 --> 01:43:48,829
- Help!
- Help.

1563
01:43:50,150 --> 01:43:51,050
Help!

1564
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:53,333
Anybody there?

1565
01:44:09,330 --> 01:44:10,230
Help!

1566
01:44:12,170 --> 01:44:13,070
Dad.

1567
01:44:15,710 --> 01:44:18,491
Help! help.

1568
01:44:22,220 --> 01:44:24,163
Is there anyone there?

1569
01:44:28,993 --> 01:44:30,053
Anybody there?

1570
01:44:40,950 --> 01:44:42,385
Hey! What's that!!

1571
01:44:44,370 --> 01:44:46,237
Captain, they're alive!!

1572
01:44:50,120 --> 01:44:51,963
They are safe, They are safe!

1573
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:09,449
My dad is here!!

1574
01:45:11,770 --> 01:45:12,957
Is everyone fine?

1575
01:45:13,690 --> 01:45:14,590
My child.

1576
01:45:15,650 --> 01:45:17,566
Hello.

1577
01:45:17,749 --> 01:45:18,328
Yes.

1578
01:45:18,330 --> 01:45:19,230
Dad.

1579
01:45:20,530 --> 01:45:22,130
My son Seung-Tae..

1580
01:45:23,163 --> 01:45:25,045
We're safe!!

1581
01:47:28,740 --> 01:47:30,666
Where are we?

1582
01:47:31,155 --> 01:47:32,618
Try calling.

1583
01:47:32,620 --> 01:47:34,369
He said near here, beside the Han River.

1584
01:47:34,370 --> 01:47:36,401
We've been along the
Han river all this time.

1585
01:47:36,403 --> 01:47:38,038
How can there be a house here?

1586
01:47:38,040 --> 01:47:40,722
Exactly, how can he have a house here?

1587
01:47:41,050 --> 01:47:41,995
Chief Park!

1588
01:47:44,510 --> 01:47:47,169
Hey Manager Kim, I brought this.

1589
01:47:47,171 --> 01:47:48,904
Ah you bought toilet paper.

1590
01:47:52,970 --> 01:47:54,178
Aih.. is this your house?

1591
01:47:55,020 --> 01:47:56,287
Is this your house?

1592
01:47:56,771 --> 01:47:57,671
This is home.

1593
01:47:58,770 --> 01:48:01,834
Today's view is Han River and tomorrow's
view is Mount Namsan

1594
01:48:01,836 --> 01:48:05,149
I'm going to Haeundae on the weekend.
This is my new home where you can go anywhere.

1595
01:48:05,150 --> 01:48:08,195
Bed, refrigerator, stove,
everything is there.

1596
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:09,529
There's everything here.

1597
01:48:09,530 --> 01:48:10,453
Reasonable.

1598
01:48:12,830 --> 01:48:15,368
However.

1599
01:48:15,370 --> 01:48:18,288
A house must be in one place.

1600
01:48:18,290 --> 01:48:21,789
It is called a house if it is occupied
for 10 or 20 years.

1601
01:48:21,790 --> 01:48:22,690
Hey.

1602
01:48:22,750 --> 01:48:24,629
Don't wait 10 years to be happy.

1603
01:48:24,630 --> 01:48:27,933
- Let us be happy today.
- Let us be happy today.

1604
01:48:27,970 --> 01:48:30,509
- Let us be in love forever.
- Let us be in love forever.

1605
01:48:30,510 --> 01:48:31,410
Good.

1606
01:48:31,470 --> 01:48:32,809
This is just our thoughts.

1607
01:48:32,810 --> 01:48:35,599
We plan to use the house buying
money to travel to the North Pole.

1608
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:38,744
But there's too little food and drinks here.

1609
01:48:39,020 --> 01:48:41,109
You can order delivery of any kind,
Should I order anything?

1610
01:48:41,110 --> 01:48:42,652
Delivery?

1611
01:48:51,488 --> 01:48:53,173
Ground Roast Chicken!

1612
01:48:53,494 --> 01:48:54,394
Amazing!!

1613
01:48:56,446 --> 01:48:57,718
Amazing!!

1614
01:48:57,720 --> 01:48:59,201
Take a look at this! Look!

1615
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:13,967
You guys scared?!!

1616
01:49:27,230 --> 01:49:28,212
Come see this.

1617
01:49:40,790 --> 01:49:43,115
Ah damn, it scared me.

1618
01:49:43,385 --> 01:49:44,295
Scared?

1619
01:49:46,420 --> 01:49:48,147
Isn't our house amazing?

1620
01:49:48,340 --> 01:49:50,123
Ahh so nice.

1621
01:49:50,411 --> 01:49:52,211
Ahh I want to live here too.

1622
01:49:56,547 --> 01:49:57,880
Ahh really beautiful.

1623
01:49:59,079 --> 01:49:59,979
Good!!
