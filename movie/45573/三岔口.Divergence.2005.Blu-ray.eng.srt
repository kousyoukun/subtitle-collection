1
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,154
Winnie

2
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,315
It's so late.

3
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,670
Mrs. Lam, I feel like I'm being followed.

4
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,949
Don't be silly

5
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,111
My hubby is waiting for me,
some way ahead. Don't worry.

6
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,872
You are scaring yourself.

7
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,951
Anyway, you'd better
find a day time job.

8
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,998
It is not a place to walk in
late at night by yourself.

9
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,315
T oilet.

10
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,433
He needs to go to toilet.

11
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,749
Have a shit or a piss?

12
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,388
What's the difference?
I need to go now.

13
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,953
Is he Mr. Suen?

14
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,353
Piss.

15
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,834
I'm done. Don't keep staring, idiot.

16
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,233
Are you Mr. Suen?

17
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,433
Bingo! I am right.

18
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,352
Haven't seen you hosted the
Police Voice show for a long time?

19
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,715
I quitted that show for years.

20
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,796
Look at him, he looks much handsome
than he was on TV.

21
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,354
You are a real cop, right?

22
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,233
Stupid! Every host in that show
is a real cop.

23
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,509
Really?

24
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,351
Mr. Suen.

25
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,275
Yes, he is with me, we'll back
to the station in 1 5 minutes.

26
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,680
I am hungry;
buy me a bowl of wonton noodles.

27
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,235
Okay.

28
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,236
You can have whatever you want
after the case finishes.

29
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,953
But not now.

30
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,879
Wonton noodles?

31
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,912
Give you shits.

32
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,033
Move! Don't stop!

33
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,152
Don't come back

34
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,189
I am sorry, Barrister T o.

35
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,554
Never mind.

36
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,675
We still don't know

37
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,593
whether Hung has got any key documents.

38
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,236
So, I would like
to keep my original thought.

39
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,713
We shall focus
on attacking the credibility of Hung,

40
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,592
the witness, your former accountant.

41
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,070
Five years ago he worked in the FTC

42
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,958
At that time,
he was strenuously censured by the SFC.

43
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,992
He was being accused of complicity
with clients, cooking the books.

44
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,997
Now I just want to know, my former
accountant testify against me.

45
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,599
Can I not go to the Court?

46
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,592
And, even if I can get off, it will
take me at least a year or so, right?

47
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,517
When can I get back my frozen money?

48
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,231
Mr. Yiu, there is
an urgent parcel for you.

49
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,199
Open it. Y es, sir.

50
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,034
Mr. Yiu.

51
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,669
This pillow is specially designed
by my therapist for me.

52
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,598
Nothing is better
to have a good sleep, right?

53
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,872
Ask Chuen to wait for me downstairs
in 1 5 minutes.

54
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,792
Yes, sir. Sit.

55
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,992
Don't you worry can't sleep well?

56
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,515
No. I have managed on a few hours'
sleep since I was a kid.

57
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,797
Well. The lesser you sleep,
the smarter you are.

58
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,675
I heard that Einstein
slept for only two hours a day,

59
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,915
same as my son.

60
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,632
He fools around till dawn.

61
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,194
After a few hours' sleep, he gets up for singing
and dancing practices, or meeting the press.

62
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,189
See, he had dark circles under
his eyes when he took this picture.

63
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,799
He looks great after the CG.

64
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,877
His new album
will be released next week.

65
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,313
I'll ask Judy to send you one.

66
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,595
Thanks.

67
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,511
This morning, at 3:20 am,

68
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,915
the witness Hung Chi-man, who
involved in a money laundering case

69
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,351
was shot to death while
he was being extradited from Canada.

70
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,637
Can you explain how did the murderer
know which flight you were on?

71
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,397
Maybe someone in Canada
leaked it out.

72
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,236
Or they could get the information
from the airline network.

73
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,792
What they need
is just to know my name.

74
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,871
Apart from your subordinates,

75
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,190
does anyone else
know you took that flight?

76
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,952
I've told you,

77
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,596
I never told anyone.

78
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,070
You are interrogating me,
am I a suspect now?

79
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,315
I haven't bathed yet.

80
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,873
You're also a cop.

81
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,508
When you take a statement from
a witness, you will do the same.

82
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,038
The witness now wants to piss.

83
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,994
Okay.

84
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,559
Has the finger-print report
come yet?

85
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,071
Not yet or no findings?

86
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,999
No finger prints.

87
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,519
They are experts.

88
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,236
If you can get their finger prints,
they are not experts.

89
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,593
Why did you cut my line?

90
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,795
Damn you!

91
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,598
have you found out
the source of the gun?

92
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,277
What the hell are you doing?

93
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,389
Police!

94
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,874
Police!

95
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,428
Show me your warrant!

96
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,189
You are a cop,
you should know the rules.

97
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,520
I am To Hou-sang,
Mr. Yiu's attorney.

98
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,318
Think twice
before taking every step.

99
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,069
Boss Jim is on the line.

100
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,514
Any good news?

101
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,716
It's almost done.
Give me a few more days.

102
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,558
A few more days. How many exactly?

103
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,790
It's really almost done.
I am very concerned about it.

104
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,911
Really! I don't think so.

105
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,550
I saw you
on the entertainment pages yesterday.

106
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,712
Hugging your son,
you looked so happy.

107
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,115
Don't read the entertainment pages,
read the front page tomorrow.

108
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,389
You shall be happier.

109
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,074
I can't quit. I enjoy reading
the entertainment pages everyday.

110
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,236
I am your son's big fan.

111
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,038
I follow him everyday.

112
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,435
Where does he go,
what pills does he take...

113
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,794
I know everything well.

114
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,439
Better than the paparazzi.

115
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,318
My son's songs don't suit you.

116
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,195
I promise,
sure everything will be okay.

117
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,636
I get stuck in heavy traffic.
I don't want it.

118
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,519
Damn your traffic!
Make a U-turn then.

119
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,872
Now the witness is dead,

120
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,792
this case has been handed over
to the Serious Crime Bureau.

121
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,397
Who killed him
or who leaked out the information?

122
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,792
Now leave it
to the Serious Crimes Bureau.

123
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,996
You guys are not green.
You should know

124
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,153
Hung Chi-man is now dead.

125
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,312
All the evidences produced by him
were gone, useless.

126
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,589
On the other hand,
this case is at an dead end.

127
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,994
Yiu Tin-chung has applied to
the court to release his frozen assets.

128
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,791
I believe that it still take some time
for the judge to proceed the release.

129
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,558
But it won't take long.

130
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,636
Now, Jim Pak-tat is our only lead.

131
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,076
Chu, debrief us.

132
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,955
Sir, I have followed Jim's file
from the very beginning.

133
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,879
He carries diplomatic visa.

134
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,157
Their embassy knows
we are investigating him.

135
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,713
He filed several complaints against
us with the Security Bureau.

136
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,714
Chu.

137
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,593
I don't want to hear the history.

138
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,799
We have to make every damn effort to
nail Yiu only for his money-laundering.

139
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,712
I don't care about any other things.

140
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,799
Save face for the unit this time.

141
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,232
You'd better go home earlier
to take some sleep.

142
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,953
Can't sleep? Well! Let's go karaoke.

143
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,556
Don't like it? How about dancing?

144
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,278
No dancing,
alright let's go dining then.

145
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,709
No dining!
Race me to the end of the road.

146
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,390
Look at you, look like shits.
Watch out! Don't back up!

147
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,795
Get out from the Admiralty station,
and then take the bus 1 03.

148
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,792
Get off at Pokfield Road.

149
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,433
Walk straight
for further five minutes.

150
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,714
Right, find Uncle Choi
in the Missing Person Unit.

151
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,669
See you at the entrance.

152
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,592
Don't forget to bring
your bottle of herbal oil.

153
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,078
It's late, why do people
still come to I. D. the body?

154
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,238
every mother
must be hurried to know...

155
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,391
whether the one lying here
is her missing son.

156
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,675
If you ask her to come tomorrow,

157
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,791
she can't help
but wait for the dawn.

158
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,668
If she proves it is not her son,

159
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,071
she could believe her son would
live at least for one more day.

160
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,313
Just like them, what makes you
come this late?

161
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,835
After a long-haul flight,
I can't sleep.

162
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,230
It's ten years,
what are you still waiting for?

163
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,709
That's the point.

164
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,868
How can a person disappear
for ten years without leaving any clues!

165
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,752
You are a cop!

166
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,030
Bruce Lee, where was he? Tell me.

167
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,918
Your girl has no emigration records
in these ten years.

168
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,230
How big is Hong Kong?
How come you still can't find her?

169
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,958
Maybe, she had an accident.

170
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,515
Lost memory,
doesn't know the way home!

171
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,392
will you shelter a stranger
for ten years?

172
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,913
Not even a cat or a dog.

173
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,270
Whenever I raise those possibilities
you give me the same answer.

174
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,519
Such perfectly consistent statement
surely you'll be a good witness.

175
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,753
It is the fact.

176
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,271
Admit it.
You just don't want to face reality.

177
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,830
Buddy, how can you be a cop?

178
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,750
Doesn't the duty of a cop mean
to find out the truth, doesn't it?

179
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,672
You'd better apply for a transfer to my unit.

180
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,592
I am getting retired
two months later.

181
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,999
You're off soon?

182
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,114
Very soon.

183
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,635
Listen, your body clock stopped,
change your battery.

184
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,875
Don't touch it!

185
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,712
It's a male, none of your business.

186
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,679
I can hear
she's calling me the whole day.

187
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,030
Don't say that outside this room.

188
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,438
If your boss hears that,

189
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,592
He would probably send you
to the asylum. Idiot!

190
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,758
What are you eating?

191
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,717
What do you think?

192
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,036
Spaghetti Marinara, for sure.

193
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,678
So pretty!

194
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,311
I wish the time would stop right
at this moment.

195
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,712
Stop!

196
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,038
It stopped.

197
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,951
You're always mine!

198
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,236
Such dance
scared the hell out of me!

199
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,951
Is that a rehearsal or not?

200
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,432
They seem lack of practices.

201
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,154
Whatever! Let's back to the work.

202
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,796
Do you see anyone
from the Serious Crime Bureau?

203
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,559
They may disguise themselves
as the waiters.

204
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,950
Or, the fans.
Push someone into the water!

205
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,671
I should have transferred
to the Serious Crimes Bureau.

206
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,432
Those are nicer jobs.

207
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,357
T o's wife

208
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,838
Amy

209
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,990
I should have asked for
20 percent more.

210
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,188
The buyer is a billionaire.

211
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,594
It's finished. Don't mention it again.

212
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,639
You don't need to know
who paid you.

213
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,555
I told you not to come back.

214
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,518
You just don't listen to me.

215
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,711
Thinking of the money,

216
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,077
I remember Lo taught me that,
women and money,

217
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,430
they forget you once you leave

218
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,156
Didn't Lo tell you this?

219
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,953
He was once paid by fake money.

220
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,555
How dare it cheat a killer!

221
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,152
Killer, so what?

222
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,878
That day in the airport,

223
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,717
just half second late,

224
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,072
or half inch wide,

225
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,677
I would have killed that cop.

226
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,872
I know that cop.

227
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,436
He is Mr. Suen
who anchored the Police Voice.

228
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,718
Does this matter to you?

229
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,872
I knew his girlfriend.

230
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,319
Jump, jump

231
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,193
Hey, come down, too.

232
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,952
Let's play something else.

233
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,799
What's up? Go to hell!

234
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,876
Not so soon.

235
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,913
Hey, get some beer.
Do you want to fool me?

236
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:37,192
Yiu Ha! Where are you?
Stop hiding! Come out.

237
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,670
When did you last see your son?

238
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,029
Last Sunday,
he went home for dinner.

239
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,159
Are you living together?

240
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,191
He stayed in the yacht lately.

241
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,958
Have you checked the yacht?

242
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,673
Sure.

243
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,239
Then, in the yacht,

244
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,799
did you notice anything wrong?

245
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,837
Let's say, any sign of fighting!
Or is it messy?

246
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,199
Have you called the record company?

247
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,880
Is he out of town for MV
recording or promotion somewhat?

248
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,315
No.

249
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,398
Did you
receive any calls for ransom?

250
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,589
No.

251
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,836
Does anyone want to harm you?

252
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,069
Commercial Crimes Bureau.

253
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,231
Mr Yiu Ha has been missing
over 48 hours.

254
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,949
As the father,
sure he is not in a good mood.

255
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,238
Hope you'd understand that.

256
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,197
Mr. Yiu, it is a matter of routine.

257
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,799
The more information we get,

258
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,592
the faster we may find your son.

259
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,269
If you agree,

260
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,000
I'll arrange setting taps
on all your phone lines.

261
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,909
It's most probably a kidnap.

262
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,832
Tapping... tapping my lines!

263
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,315
Guess what!
They tapped all my calls long ago.

264
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,195
Any news?

265
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,117
When can I get back
my frozen money?

266
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,433
Be more patient,
shall be within a week.

267
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,629
They shall have no further excuse.

268
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,795
A week?

269
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,070
I am running out of patience?
And my son...

270
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,718
Are you saying that the missing of
your son and this case are related?

271
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,559
They are putting pressure on me
to return the money.

272
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,432
They may suspect me of embezzling
the money, so they kidnap...

273
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,310
Are you sure?

274
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,430
This is one of the possibilities.

275
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,919
They give me no damn answer.

276
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,876
Maybe, that bastard son
overdosed on his pills.

277
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,352
Or, it is a real kidnapping.

278
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,711
Anyway, anything could happen.

279
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,552
Otherwise,
I won't report it to the police.

280
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,953
You have someone
for doing dirty work, right.

281
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,359
Yes, I get a private eye.

282
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,074
I've tried my people on it.

283
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,551
Your guys have to be gentler;
I don't want to screw them up.

284
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,759
Understood.

285
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,354
Yes, To hired me
to find Yiu Ha, but...

286
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,033
you know, he is the big big lawyer.

287
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,231
I can never meet him in person.

288
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,118
I met only the small folks.

289
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,073
Sure, I am not the only one
working for To.

290
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,357
Chan and Fat Kwan
also take his jobs.

291
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:41,117
Fine, do you find anything then?
Who did it?

292
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:47,195
Mister Suen,
I'll speak to you if I can speak.

293
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,237
Buddy here, buddy there
when you need my money or help.

294
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,032
Now you call me Mister.

295
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,677
Just return your buddy
a favor this time, okay?

296
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,351
I might get killed for this.

297
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,913
Just can't tell.

298
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,074
I have to go.

299
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,759
By the way, tell you another lead.

300
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,115
It's just hearsay.
I take no responsibility.

301
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,236
A girl called Ting, a new face.

302
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,953
She is very active recently.

303
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,156
She is an agent of assassins.

304
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,033
All of them are pros.

305
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,992
Have you told
the Serious Crime Bureau?

306
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,636
You think I am a patron?

307
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,112
Who is looking for Ting?

308
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,076
Doctor Chan suggested me
to order a health pillow from you.

309
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,873
Wrong number.

310
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,509
This site contractor
keeps a mistress.

311
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,155
That woman broke his safe.

312
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,918
took all his stuff

313
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,514
Then mess up the place,
make it look like being robbed.

314
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,119
That's so cheap.

315
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,074
Turn him down.

316
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,753
You don't take this job,
someone else does.

317
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,193
Are you insane!

318
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,313
Take such a job will

319
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,392
Ruin our reputation

320
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,998
And you promise me
that you work only for me.

321
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,878
I don't remember that.

322
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,715
Indeed,
I'll give it to someone else

323
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,359
and sleep with him.

324
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,394
Thank you.

325
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,955
Son Of A Millionaire
Disappeared Mysteriously

326
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,070
Yiu Ha Has Been Missing For Ten Days

327
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,195
All here.

328
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,032
That's all we got.

329
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,393
When will the photographer
come back?

330
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,835
He is a free-lancer;
he's not in this office.

331
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,549
Our magazine can't afford
to hire so many paparazzi.

332
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,710
Here are 20 something pictures.

333
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,109
Will there be more with him?

334
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,551
Sure, you know he is a free-lancer.

335
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,990
He must take as many as he can and
sell to as many magazines as possible

336
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,593
You just can't do anything
with them.

337
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,432
Where can I find him?

338
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,919
Thomas

339
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,279
Thomas Liu

340
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,351
I didn't kill that guy.

341
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,352
Trust me, Mr. Suen.

342
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,113
You're tired.

343
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,635
Get away! Police! Stop!

344
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,153
Take cover!

345
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,113
No!

346
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:44,874
No! Don't do that!

347
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,709
Stop, please!

348
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,359
I have something to tell you.

349
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,713
Shoot.

350
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,792
I am pregnant.

351
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,959
My baby!

352
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:07,113
I've got a son! Junior Suen.

353
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,397
Then we'll have our baby welcoming
party right after the wedding banquet

354
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,828
Bravo!

355
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,508
I've got a son!

356
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:19,113
Wonderful!
I've got a son! I am a father!

357
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:33,276
Fong! Fong!

358
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:43,436
hang on! Don't sleep!
Call an ambulance!

359
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,039
here is Central Market.

360
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:48,596
Calling backup, one officer down.

361
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:49,596
Seal off the area now!

362
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:50,755
Yes sir.

363
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:28,595
A Cop Ran Into The Suspect
And Started A Street Chase.

364
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,557
I didn't kill the photographer.

365
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,513
You know
how much I charge for killing.

366
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,390
I know, it is for fun, huh?

367
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,637
I'm a killer. I should do something
out of charity occasionally.

368
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,749
Hey, you want to beat me?

369
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,395
Don't be so stubborn.

370
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,876
If you are capable, sometimes
you need not follow the rules.

371
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,433
Look at them.

372
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,395
If I want to,
I would have been one of them.

373
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,671
Why did you make contact
with that cop?

374
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,392
Why didn't you listen to me?

375
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,791
You have gone too far.

376
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,071
That something
really stuck in my mind,

377
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,636
I just want to do it, and did it.

378
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,311
If I was that obedient,
I wouldn't have been a killer.

379
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,353
1 5:00.

380
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,278
There is a cargo ship
to the Philippines.

381
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,638
Good, I can go diving.

382
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,559
Look at you!

383
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,715
Your head's bleeding.
Wounds on foot.

384
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,393
What the hell were you doing there?

385
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,551
I asked you to pin a tail on Yiu.

386
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,673
Stop!

387
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:03,510
Stop!

388
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:04,959
You have the right to suspend me.

389
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,036
I also have my right
to say that I am not wrong.

390
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,874
Money laundering, killing witness,
the missing of the suspect's son.

391
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,228
All these might be connected.

392
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,152
If you don't look into them,
you'll never know.

393
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:19,994
Yes, your girl has been missing
for 1 0 years.

394
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,272
Is that also connected here?

395
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,276
Following orders

396
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,231
obeying your commander,
no private investigation.

397
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,272
These are the basics
for all the police.

398
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,719
Except you.

399
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,790
Lucky you,
the autopsy report stated that

400
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,837
the photographer
died over 20 hours.

401
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,319
And Chu can confirm your alibi.

402
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:43,228
If not, someone must say
that you are mad,

403
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,437
killed the son of the suspect,
and was pictured by the paparazzi,

404
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,837
and murdered the witness

405
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,271
Do you think you can say
you are not involved?

406
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,558
Think about if you were me

407
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,192
the witness was shot dead
right in front of you.

408
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,878
What would you do, sir?

409
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,071
You're trash!

410
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,838
Defendant, please stand up.

411
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,352
Now this court finds

412
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,439
on the charge of D. D.
possession against Wong Man-kit

413
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,079
verdict of not guilty

414
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,358
and that he be acquitted accordingly.

415
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,117
Mr. To!

416
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,913
It's Mao Wai-ben.

417
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,517
Congratulations,
can I talk to you for a few minutes?

418
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,117
You should contact John.

419
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:30,239
I know, but for this time,
I think I should talk to you directly.

420
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,113
Have you found Yiu Ha?

421
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,280
Take a look at these pictures first.

422
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,079
from bank tomorrow

423
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,077
You'll get the notice
of the release of your frozen money

424
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,108
Thank you.

425
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,871
By the way,
I have something to show you.

426
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,553
It's from my private eye.

427
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,557
Apart from Yiu Ha's yacht,

428
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,399
there were
eight other yachts on that day,

429
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,828
According to the records
of the pier,

430
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,837
That ship docked at 21 :00.

431
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,678
and departed at 22:43.

432
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,199
It's a leased ship.

433
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:24,430
The leasing company didn't disclose
the identity of the lessee.

434
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:27,353
Leave them to the police,
they'll find out very soon.

435
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,794
Mr. Yiu

436
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,430
if you still can't find Yiu Ha
after your money is released,

437
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:39,911
do you still think
that it was done by your Boss?

438
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,148
When my elder son was knocked down
to death by a car,

439
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,633
at least I know what happened.

440
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:51,838
Please let me know
whether my only son is alive or not.

441
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,552
I am not involved!

442
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,998
Hey, Baby.

443
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,997
Psychologist

444
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:50,912
Moca! Run!

445
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,880
1 2 3 up!

446
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:54,792
Do you know Mao Wai-ben?

447
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,798
We used to patrol together
in Kwun Tong.

448
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,879
Do you know him well?

449
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,079
We go out for dinner
every once in a while.

450
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,992
When did you last see him?

451
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,598
Last Wednesday.

452
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,915
After quitting the force,
he becomes a private detective.

453
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:10,959
I have asked him
for some information.

454
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,793
What kind of information?

455
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,678
The case of Yiu's son.

456
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,239
What did he give you?

457
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,239
Nothing.

458
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:21,911
At the photographer's house,
other than the suspect,

459
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,519
did you see anyone else?

460
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,669
Nope.

461
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,028
Really!

462
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,510
I know what would happen
if I give a false statement.

463
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:30,958
What happened to Mao?

464
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,917
We found his body.

465
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:35,836
The photographer might have been
killed by the same murderer.

466
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,355
The security guard of that building said that
he saw Mao there the night before.

467
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:41,155
Mao ran into debt.

468
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,911
The pictures of the photographer
may turn his situation around.

469
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,551
I think I can take over Mao's job.

470
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,438
T ake it easy! (Pakistan)

471
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,237
Bye!

472
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:22,632
Bye! Take it easy!(Pakistan)

473
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,510
You know Indian!
I don't know you are so smart!

474
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:26,874
That's Pakistan.

475
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:29,036
To work here, I have to learn more
languages, even though just a bit.

476
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:37,512
If the Head knows it,
I'll be fired.

477
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:39,552
I'll pay the rest of your living.

478
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,633
I have all sorts of interest;

479
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:44,030
not even a millionaire
can afford paying my living! You?

480
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:46,198
You're going to be fired.

481
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,912
You'd better mind your own ass.

482
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:52,078
Look at you, smell like corpses.

483
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,713
How many days
that you haven't bathed?

484
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:56,713
Would that make you
take pity on me?

485
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,392
Mao was being strangled

486
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:04,155
See the deep gash on his right neck.

487
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:06,151
The murderer is a left-hander.

488
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:09,118
The gash is thin;
it must be a wire again.

489
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,959
Again?

490
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:13,678
A similar case happened last month.

491
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:15,114
I don't know the wire is on sale,

492
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:16,832
or the left-handed killer is on sale.

493
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,638
Left-hander again?

494
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:23,277
I went with a family to I. D. that
body. It's a MP (Missing Person).

495
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,392
Give me that file.

496
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,793
The body was found
and the case was closed.

497
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,552
The papers must have been sent back.

498
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,073
Well, find Leung Tek
at Shumshuipo Police station.

499
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,758
Tell him you're my friend.

500
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:49,834
Suen, don't blame me.
I have to tell you again...

501
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:52,633
Uncle Choi, you know,

502
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,679
I just can't stop.

503
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,720
If I stop, I'll...
Back to ten years ago?

504
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,353
Lately I saw a person.

505
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,271
She looks utterly like Fong.

506
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:11,149
So, go and pursue her.
There's nothing worse than you are now.

507
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:18,228
She is married, has kids,
and is living in a big house.

508
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:20,792
She is blessed.

509
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:24,956
Every time I see her house lighted.

510
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:27,278
I have an illusion that.

511
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:29,996
Fong is waiting there for me
to have dinner.

512
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:33,799
Why don't you think of it this way?

513
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,958
Actually, Fong is still alive.

514
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,754
And you have broken up with her, okay?

515
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:46,631
Okay, find Fong for me.

516
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,352
Then I break up with her.

517
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,791
Suen, you don't need
to find Leung Tek.

518
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,309
Go to find Chan
at the funeral home.

519
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,392
Cause you are a dead man.

520
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:12,873
Two morning walkers found the death
body in an alley at Nam Chong Street

521
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:16,511
The victim named So Fu-on,
28 years old.

522
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:18,636
A staff
in a convenient store nearby

523
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:22,036
witnessed
that he bought something that night.

524
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:25,391
But his two thousand dollars
were still with him.

525
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:28,200
He wasn't a decent guy.

526
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:30,591
He had two previous
criminal convictions.

527
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:32,352
Both are indecent assaults.

528
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:34,033
For the first time,
he was sentenced to be bound over.

529
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:35,792
For the next time, he was sentenced
to jail for half a year.

530
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,712
Last year, he was charged
with rape and murder.

531
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,798
Since there was only circumstantial
evidence, he was not found guilty.

532
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,792
The victim was only 1 3. Poor girl.

533
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:46,912
Would it be done
by the victim's family?

534
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:49,753
I've checked, but I don't think so.

535
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,831
The murderer is quite a character,
like using wires.

536
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:53,871
Shouldn't it be easier
to buy a sharp knife?

537
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,317
Maybe the killer
is an obsessive hygiene addict.

538
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:59,159
With obsessive cleanliness,
with a strong power,

539
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:00,912
and left handed.

540
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:03,275
I, myself,
haven't seen such a murderer before.

541
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:07,277
To Hou-sang And The Firm.

542
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:28,918
You can't beat me to it.

543
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,268
Drive off!

544
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,958
I have something good for you.

545
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,514
These pictures were taken
from the photographer's house.

546
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:48,550
I guess the photographer
saw Yiu Ha brought the LSD,

547
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:51,274
They were so sneaky,
so he took the pictures.

548
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,436
Never miss a single opportunity.

549
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:56,237
To Hou-sang sold pills to Yiu Ha?

550
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:59,032
Does it look like that?

551
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:01,356
You should ask what T o came for.

552
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:04,879
Only these two pictures?

553
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:08,430
Not just two, there's many.

554
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:09,999
But those are useless to you.

555
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:14,073
The one who killed the photographer
took the CD-R away.

556
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:16,509
But he forgot about the hard disk.

557
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,836
That guy is not familiar
with computers.

558
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:21,711
How do I know
if those pictures are not fake?

559
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:24,157
I don't know what you want.

560
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,157
I also don't know what I want.

561
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:31,753
Why do I pick you, a suspended police
among the force, for help?

562
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,876
Maybe, I want to show you...

563
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:35,559
If I were a cop,
I would have been a better one.

564
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,518
Should you actually be a cop,
you'd know that

565
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:41,834
it's much easier to be a criminal.

566
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:44,952
You have rules to comply;
sure you can't react at will.

567
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,112
Sometimes, the police
should play the role of crooks.

568
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:48,872
And the crooks should play
the role of the police.

569
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,399
That would be fun.

570
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:53,314
Many of your buddies
welcome quick money.

571
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:54,555
Otherwise, no one would know
which flight you took that day!

572
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:56,636
That made you meet your Waterloo
at the airport.

573
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:07,273
Keep driving!
Return it to me!

574
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,272
If you don't want to die,
keep driving!

575
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,158
Someone asked me to tell you.

576
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:19,359
Your girlfriend is dead.

577
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,239
It was just an accident.

578
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:23,559
It was quick. No pain.

579
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:43,759
Mr. Jim.

580
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,392
Any good news? Tell me.

581
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,158
My son has been reported missing
for fifteen days.

582
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,638
Isn't it for promotion?

583
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,392
Do you know where he is?

584
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,073
How can I know that?

585
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:58,788
Answer me.

586
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,718
Is he with you?

587
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:03,279
Okay, I answer you now.

588
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:06,312
My boss can't stand
the waiting any longer.

589
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:08,078
If you can't fix it,

590
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:09,633
not only your son disappeared,

591
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:10,954
you and I would disappear too.

592
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:12,553
Don't get me embroiled.

593
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:38,838
Let me heat some milk for you.

594
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:40,873
You'll have better sleep then.

595
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:43,034
That's nothing, go back to sleep.

596
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:46,717
If you change to handle civil cases,

597
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,399
you must have less trouble.

598
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:54,119
That's easier said than done!

599
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:07,510
We just spend lesser and save it up.

600
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:13,034
We can sell this house
and the other two apartments

601
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:17,110
I believe
that we can pay off the loan.

602
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:22,394
Where shall we live
if we sell all our properties?

603
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:25,993
Rent a house,
just like most of the people do.

604
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,115
No way!

605
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:33,788
I can't lose.

606
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:42,039
Lose some money,
but you can earn a comfort life.

607
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:45,755
I am comfort.

608
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:51,395
I used to be a light sleeper.

609
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:53,312
Come on, go to sleep.

610
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:03,114
Has Yiu got his money back?

611
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:05,274
Don't ask.

612
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:08,598
You need not know that.

613
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:11,999
Come on, go back to sleep.

614
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:26,669
Hubby...

615
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:32,755
Can you pick your own case
next time?

616
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:36,999
I have no choice!

617
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:39,753
They all said they're innocent.

618
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:46,195
If there is one real innocent person
in every ten cases,

619
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,355
at least, I do one thing correct.

620
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:10,834
You hired someone to kill me!

621
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,149
And you asked such a shit to kill me!

622
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:13,918
Who do you think I am?
You stupid ass!

623
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:17,996
Why do you come back? Why?

624
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:21,909
Don't you think
you deserve to die?

625
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:25,792
You should have died
for 1 0 times already!

626
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:32,832
You deserve all that happened
to you today, you know that?

627
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:34,789
In this world, don't you think

628
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:37,832
you're the only killer
and I am the only agent, don't you?

629
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,877
You, stupid! Damn you!

630
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:45,400
I just know buyers
are all around the world.

631
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,118
Call your buyer.

632
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:51,753
Tell him I need 3 million
to settle it.

633
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:57,035
Otherwise,
ask him to read the newspaper tomorrow.

634
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:29,433
Please bring my son back to me.
Please guide me through this.

635
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,716
Send me back my son

636
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:04,711
What do you want to eat? Wonton noodles?

637
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:06,433
I had that yesterday.

638
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:49,399
Get off!

639
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,959
I won't let you die
before I get the money.

640
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:07,519
How many shots do you think you need
to kill me instantly, painlessly?

641
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,279
Don't shoot at my head, my face?

642
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,796
You really love your look.

643
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:21,631
Anyway,
until the neighbor smell the stink,

644
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,591
and the police come in,

645
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:27,038
maybe worms are already
all over my body.

646
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,433
I won't be good looking by then.

647
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:32,394
Forget it...

648
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:39,869
Okay, I'll let the police
ompete with the worms, is that all right?

649
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:50,954
He has wired the money.

650
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:56,352
Do you think
you can still spend the money

651
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:03,038
You never know before trying.

652
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:10,875
From this oracle,

653
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:15,599
The first part means the land,
the second part means the sun.

654
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:22,670
The sun's down the land becomes dark,
it means difficulties.

655
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:27,875
So you have to be patient
and keep your faith.

656
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:34,118
Wait and get prepared,
so you'll get it over.

657
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:41,120
Mr. Yiu, the police called,
saying that they found a body.

658
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,236
They want you to identify
if it's young master.

659
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:06,910
You said I'd face some difficulties.

660
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,118
Does it mean my son...?

661
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:18,677
It's an emperor story.

662
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:23,915
At the ancient time,
the General was locked up.

663
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:27,549
At last, he took a rebellion...

664
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:31,959
He toppled the reign of a tyrant.

665
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:01,629
I dreamed of a coffin,
my husband was sleeping inside.

666
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:04,272
People around dragged me away.

667
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:08,989
Suddenly,
my husband sat up and told me that.

668
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:13,918
He wanted to have lunch with me.

669
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:18,872
People sometimes see relatives
leaving them in their dreams.

670
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,755
Your husband
is in a mood again lately.

671
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:28,196
He got many tough cases.

672
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:31,599
Men are always not willing
to admit they have emotional problems.

673
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:34,232
He likes his job.

674
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:36,552
At the same time, he hates it.

675
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:40,268
It's because he has to help someone
who doesn't deserve it.

676
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:45,196
Or, he shouldn't measure
who deserve it or not.

677
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:49,548
I know and my husband knows it too.

678
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:54,559
Actually he knows they're guilty.

679
01:18:57,200 --> 01:19:01,512
So, he finds it very painful
to keep working. He feels confused.

680
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:08,189
If you were him, what would you do?

681
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:49,634
Since the fingure
and the age of this victim

682
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,159
is similar to the descriptions
of your son,

683
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:53,311
Mr. Yiu, please.

684
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:06,830
Mr. Yiu, are you okay?

685
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:07,392
I can't find a single thing
that looks like our young master,

686
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:08,356
are you just fooling?

687
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:09,669
Mind your words.

688
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:11,392
Now, sign and leave.

689
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:31,112
Find Boss Jim for me,
I want to talk to him.

690
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:32,309
Yes, Mr. Yiu.

691
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,798
Give me back my son!...

692
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:07,634
Hurry up!

693
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:21,035
Give my son back to me!

694
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:38,270
What are you doing? No!

695
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:13,991
My son...

696
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:10,993
Your son died more terribly
than you are going to be.

697
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:56,271
Good! That's called
doing justice to the world!

698
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:00,670
It's not easy to kill Yiu Tin-chung.

699
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:04,189
But, you hate him so much,
killing him can't satisfy you, right!

700
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:06,830
So you stole the person he loved.

701
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:11,795
and make him so anxious to do something
stupid, finally killing himself.

702
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:40,949
Every time you kill,
have you thought about the consequences?

703
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,831
Do you get something wrong in here?

704
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:48,639
I am a nice guy.

705
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:51,433
I am a good attorney.

706
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:53,912
You need to support your case
by evidences.

707
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:57,876
You have no witness, so I'll win.
I know the laws.

708
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:01,358
All because of you trash.

709
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:05,350
I just helped you
to clean up the mess.

710
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:07,192
Have you thought of your family?

711
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:09,671
Have you thought that you have
done something bad to her?

712
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:19,638
You follow me everyday.
You can see that.

713
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:21,518
You know I am a nice guy.

714
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:24,031
I follow her everyday.

715
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:28,315
She is not happy,
do you know that?

716
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:04,673
You are so weak.

717
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:49,794
Stupid ass,
why didn't you kill all those bastards?

718
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:55,149
If you can't do it,
let me do it for you.

719
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:56,958
Let me do justice to the world.

720
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:31,798
Why did you lock her up?

721
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,878
She is sad, do you know that?

722
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:36,831
Why did you lock her up?

723
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:01,714
NO!

724
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,069
No!

725
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:08,873
Let him go!

726
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:12,349
Fong!

727
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:15,393
Let him go!

728
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:17,393
He killed many people!

729
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:21,753
He will hurt you.

730
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:27,596
I beg you to let him go!

731
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:32,872
You will kill him!

732
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:35,919
We can be together soon.

733
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:42,236
I've found you for ten years.

734
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:03,751
I have also found you
for these ten years.

735
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:10,558
I've been waiting for you.

736
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:18,875
I feel so bad.

737
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:46,113
Hubby!

738
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:48,994
Hubby!

739
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:56,557
Don't come over!

740
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:18,759
Hubby!

741
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:27,195
On that day,
I squatted down to avoid that shot,

742
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:29,838
just because
I suddenly thought of you.

743
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:34,359
You are the last woman
that I should trust in this planet.

744
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:38,518
I am really so bad

745
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:43,274
If you have chance,
you'll kill me for sure.

746
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:48,716
Two erinaceous
sheltered from rain together.

747
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:50,598
You saw it yourself
or you just heard that story?

748
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:53,877
What if one erinaceous
and one crocodile,

749
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,115
do you think they can make it?

750
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:56,998
It depends on
how long the rain lasts.

751
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:04,192
Is your real name Ting?

752
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:07,399
What?

753
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:09,630
Ting is a nice name.

754
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:25,991
We got the lab report.

755
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:29,028
The skin tissue in So Fu-on's nails,

756
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:31,913
matches the DNA of T o.

757
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:34,191
So, To Hou-sang admitted that,

758
01:35:34,360 --> 01:35:37,670
he killed So Fu-on during the time
he suffered from a mental disorder.

759
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:41,512
How about Yiu's son?

760
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:43,238
He said nothing regarding him.

761
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:44,759
We still can't find the body.

762
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:48,189
We have a vacancy here.

763
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:50,112
Why don't you apply
for a transfer to here?

764
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:51,759
I've found a better place.

765
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:53,797
Really? Where?

766
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:55,992
I'll take up Uncle Choi's duty.

767
01:35:56,240 --> 01:35:58,913
For the Missing Person Unit?
It's a boring job.

768
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:00,871
You have to go to the morgue
all the time.

769
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,513
Not exactly.

770
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:04,432
Finally,
someone missing would be found.

771
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:01,273
Finish her off!

772
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:12,279
Do it!

773
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:14,072
This is the first time!
