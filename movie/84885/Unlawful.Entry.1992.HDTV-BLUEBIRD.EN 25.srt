1
00:03:00,322 --> 00:03:02,961
You once said, aboutyour childhood,

2
00:03:03,042 --> 00:03:05,192
"I grew up with seriousness

3
00:03:05,282 --> 00:03:07,273
all aroundme."

4
00:03:07,362 --> 00:03:10,115
Yeah, myparents were very, verystrict.

5
00:03:10,202 --> 00:03:12,272
I come from a Catholic family.

6
00:03:12,362 --> 00:03:14,637
There are five kids in ourfamily.

7
00:03:14,722 --> 00:03:18,078
We weren'tpoor,
but we were lowermiddle class.

8
00:03:18,162 --> 00:03:20,232
We didn'thave a lot ofmoney.

9
00:03:20,322 --> 00:03:22,472
My dad's theory was keep working,

10
00:03:22,562 --> 00:03:24,553
work hard, work hard.

11
00:03:24,642 --> 00:03:26,633
And er, prettymuch no play.

12
00:03:26,722 --> 00:03:30,112
It was almostlike notgoodin ourfamily

13
00:03:30,202 --> 00:03:33,717
ifyou laughed
or ifyou wanted to have a lot offun.

14
00:03:33,802 --> 00:03:36,191
So, thatstays with you a little bit

15
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:41,517
I think ithelpedmy tennis,
because I did work hard.

16
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:47,040
But I think it's important
to have a balance in life...

17
00:03:53,002 --> 00:03:57,154
He thinks I put up $100,000 of my money
just to watch it disappear?

18
00:03:57,243 --> 00:04:01,554
- He doesn't care aboutyourmoney!
- He doesn't have to. I just want to know!

19
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:04,634
To the people he represents,
it's pocket change.

20
00:04:04,723 --> 00:04:07,475
Does he know
what this will do to me and Karen?

21
00:04:07,562 --> 00:04:10,838
- Iknowyou're out there.
- Yeah, but does he know?

22
00:04:10,922 --> 00:04:12,640
Michael...

23
00:04:12,722 --> 00:04:17,671
Listen, Roger, it sounds good. Fax it
to me, I'll talk to you in the morning.

24
00:04:17,762 --> 00:04:20,230
Sorry, I tried to keep it quiet.

25
00:04:20,322 --> 00:04:23,678
I heard a noise from downstairs.
Didn't you hear it?

26
00:04:23,762 --> 00:04:26,401
No, I was cracking on the phone with Roger.

27
00:04:26,482 --> 00:04:30,714
It's probably the wind... or
fuzz-face here. Why does he hate me?

28
00:04:30,802 --> 00:04:33,794
If you paid him more attention,
he'd like you better.

29
00:04:33,882 --> 00:04:36,601
He would if I fed him goodies, like you do.

30
00:04:36,683 --> 00:04:38,638
I think you're jealous of Tiny.

31
00:04:38,722 --> 00:04:41,190
He gets to sleep with you more than I do.

32
00:04:43,723 --> 00:04:46,555
Is that...? I'll go down.

33
00:04:46,643 --> 00:04:48,793
Maybe we should call the police.

34
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:51,197
No, it's OK. I'll just check it out.

35
00:04:58,042 --> 00:05:02,002
Don't worry. If it's anything serious,
I'll come back for my driver.

36
00:07:14,923 --> 00:07:16,834
Michael, is everything all right?

37
00:07:16,923 --> 00:07:20,154
- Somebody's in the house. Call the police.
- What?

38
00:07:20,243 --> 00:07:22,234
Michael!

39
00:07:29,443 --> 00:07:31,434
No!

40
00:07:35,043 --> 00:07:37,113
Stop, motherfucker! Back off!

41
00:07:38,323 --> 00:07:39,517
Back off!

42
00:07:39,603 --> 00:07:41,594
- Back off!
- OK.

43
00:07:42,402 --> 00:07:45,042
Drop it. Drop it! Drop it!

44
00:07:46,123 --> 00:07:47,715
Take anything you want!

45
00:07:47,803 --> 00:07:50,397
- Here, you can have my watch!
- I don't want no watch!

46
00:07:50,483 --> 00:07:52,474
Please don't hurt her.

47
00:07:52,643 --> 00:07:55,362
I'll give you anything you want, please.

48
00:08:28,123 --> 00:08:29,317
Karen!

49
00:08:50,803 --> 00:08:53,442
...outside of6th at 718.

50
00:09:04,724 --> 00:09:06,362
Police, sir.

51
00:09:09,923 --> 00:09:11,720
Hi, come on in, guys.

52
00:09:11,803 --> 00:09:14,477
I'm Officer Cole. My
partner, Officer Davis.

53
00:09:14,563 --> 00:09:15,518
Michael Carr.

54
00:09:15,603 --> 00:09:17,878
What happened to your foot, Mr Carr?

55
00:09:17,963 --> 00:09:20,397
I knocked a beer bottle
down in the kitchen.

56
00:09:20,484 --> 00:09:22,474
It's nothing really.

57
00:09:22,564 --> 00:09:25,031
Mr Carr, can you tell us what happened?

58
00:09:25,123 --> 00:09:28,672
Yeah. We were upstairs in my office,
my wife and I,

59
00:09:28,763 --> 00:09:30,754
and we heard a noise.

60
00:09:30,843 --> 00:09:33,562
This is my wife, Karen.

61
00:09:33,644 --> 00:09:35,440
Thank you for coming so quickly.

62
00:09:35,523 --> 00:09:39,073
Can you tell us what happened
after you heard the noise?

63
00:09:39,164 --> 00:09:41,154
Michael went down and I,

64
00:09:41,244 --> 00:09:43,235
I heard another noise

65
00:09:43,324 --> 00:09:45,315
and I went down... and...

66
00:09:48,203 --> 00:09:50,764
It's OK, Mrs Carr. Just take your time.

67
00:09:50,843 --> 00:09:53,232
This man jumped out ofthe closet

68
00:09:53,323 --> 00:09:55,518
and he and Michael fought.

69
00:09:55,604 --> 00:09:57,833
It wasn't much of a fight, really.

70
00:09:57,923 --> 00:10:00,801
I grabbed his leg, he
was trying to get away.

71
00:10:00,884 --> 00:10:03,397
He got out in the kitchen,
got hold of Karen

72
00:10:03,483 --> 00:10:05,634
and took off out through the back.

73
00:10:05,724 --> 00:10:07,953
The son of a bitch put
a knife to her throat.

74
00:10:08,043 --> 00:10:10,113
- Are you OK?
- Yes, I am.

75
00:10:10,203 --> 00:10:11,716
- Do you need a doctor?
- No.

76
00:10:11,804 --> 00:10:13,316
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, thank you.

77
00:10:14,683 --> 00:10:15,877
Tiny!

78
00:10:16,403 --> 00:10:17,722
Tiny?

79
00:10:18,963 --> 00:10:20,522
Come here, Tiny.

80
00:10:20,603 --> 00:10:23,640
You're not a very good watchcat,
are you, Tiny?

81
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:24,713
Useless.

82
00:10:24,804 --> 00:10:28,318
I guess he likes policemen.

83
00:10:32,363 --> 00:10:35,878
We'll have someone over in the morning
to dust for prints.

84
00:10:35,963 --> 00:10:37,954
Try and not disturb too much.

85
00:10:38,043 --> 00:10:42,002
We've had a bunch of break-ins here.
We think it's the same guy.

86
00:10:42,084 --> 00:10:45,393
- In this street?
- This general area, but we'll get him.

87
00:10:45,483 --> 00:10:49,159
- I wouldn't mind seeing that.
- Does anyone want any coffee?

88
00:10:49,243 --> 00:10:51,234
Yes. I never turn down coffee.

89
00:10:51,323 --> 00:10:53,359
Whoa, watch the glass.

90
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,320
Oh.

91
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,883
Excuse me.

92
00:10:56,963 --> 00:10:58,113
Thanks.

93
00:10:58,203 --> 00:11:01,991
This guy who's doing this,
is there any chance he'll come back?

94
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,882
We were told this was a safe neighbourhood.

95
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:08,354
All things considered,
this is a safe neighbourhood.

96
00:11:08,443 --> 00:11:11,800
Mr Carr probably scared him so much,
he won't come back.

97
00:11:11,884 --> 00:11:14,159
It doesn't matter. I'm getting a gun.

98
00:11:14,243 --> 00:11:15,836
- What?
- I'm getting a gun.

99
00:11:15,923 --> 00:11:18,154
- No guns.
- Maybe she'll listen to you guys.

100
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:20,360
Don't get a gun.

101
00:11:20,444 --> 00:11:22,594
It's easy for you to say, you've got one.

102
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:25,118
- I'm trained to use it.
- I've done some shooting.

103
00:11:25,203 --> 00:11:27,592
At targets... Not people.

104
00:11:27,683 --> 00:11:30,482
Take our advice. Get an alarm, get a dog,

105
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,236
but forget about guns.

106
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:34,360
The wrong people always get hurt.

107
00:11:39,124 --> 00:11:41,115
Nice people.

108
00:11:41,204 --> 00:11:43,434
Hey. I know what you're thinking.

109
00:11:44,443 --> 00:11:46,479
What am I thinking, Roy?

110
00:11:55,724 --> 00:11:58,284
I'm never gonna be able to sleep.

111
00:11:58,364 --> 00:12:00,400
Me neither.

112
00:12:05,404 --> 00:12:06,837
I thought he...

113
00:12:08,923 --> 00:12:10,914
When he grabbed me...

114
00:12:14,924 --> 00:12:16,915
It's all right.

115
00:12:17,004 --> 00:12:19,915
I don't think I can stay
here, it's just so weird.

116
00:12:20,004 --> 00:12:23,360
We'll get some things together
and go to a hotel, OK?

117
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:26,163
No. I don't think I can live here any more.

118
00:12:26,724 --> 00:12:28,760
I think we should sell the house.

119
00:12:28,843 --> 00:12:31,642
Honey, wait a minute. You love this house.

120
00:12:31,724 --> 00:12:34,955
I know, but we really don't need this now.

121
00:12:35,044 --> 00:12:36,682
We're in way over our heads.

122
00:12:36,764 --> 00:12:39,642
- We can barely afford it.
- Don't get carried away.

123
00:12:39,724 --> 00:12:42,397
You know what we're gonna do? We're just...

124
00:12:42,484 --> 00:12:44,714
We're gonna take that cop's advice.

125
00:12:44,804 --> 00:12:48,160
Tomorrow morning, I'll make a few calls.
Come here.

126
00:12:48,244 --> 00:12:51,441
We'll get the best security system
known to man.

127
00:12:52,364 --> 00:12:54,355
If that doesn't do it,

128
00:12:54,724 --> 00:12:56,874
we'll get a... killer watchdog.

129
00:12:56,964 --> 00:13:01,116
A vicious... pit bull with fangs

130
00:13:01,203 --> 00:13:03,195
with a stud collar.

131
00:13:04,204 --> 00:13:05,922
Come on, honey.

132
00:13:06,004 --> 00:13:07,995
We'll be all right.

133
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:11,915
Come on.

134
00:13:12,724 --> 00:13:15,443
You chased him around with a putter?

135
00:13:15,524 --> 00:13:19,119
- You're a hero!
- Dirty Harry and Arnold Palmer all in one.

136
00:13:19,204 --> 00:13:22,799
It sounds pretty intense.
I'd have had a heart attack.

137
00:13:22,884 --> 00:13:24,875
You did OK. Are you guys all right?

138
00:13:24,964 --> 00:13:26,955
Yeah. Well, Karen's upset.

139
00:13:27,044 --> 00:13:29,035
Shit. Here he comes.

140
00:13:30,324 --> 00:13:32,315
Do we have to kiss him?

141
00:13:40,164 --> 00:13:41,961
Gentlemen.

142
00:13:42,724 --> 00:13:46,000
I read your prospectus.
Demographics look good.

143
00:13:46,084 --> 00:13:49,201
Jerry, I'm not a big
believer in demographics.

144
00:13:49,284 --> 00:13:52,879
- I think it's a lawyer's tool, no offence.
- None taken.

145
00:13:52,964 --> 00:13:56,274
- Amazing place.
- The potential here is fantastic.

146
00:13:56,364 --> 00:14:01,040
I learnt to go with my instincts.
I used demographics once and went belly up.

147
00:14:01,124 --> 00:14:03,843
- Was that Denver?
- He's done his homework!

148
00:14:03,924 --> 00:14:07,200
You weren't the only one.
I put a lot of my clients' money there.

149
00:14:07,284 --> 00:14:09,195
Those buildings are still empty.

150
00:14:09,284 --> 00:14:11,002
That won't happen down here.

151
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:14,281
This downtown area
has undergone a revitalisation.

152
00:14:14,364 --> 00:14:17,401
The new buildings are
all filled with people,

153
00:14:17,484 --> 00:14:20,920
all within shouting distance
of this place here.

154
00:14:21,004 --> 00:14:25,680
OK. I want to put on a backers' party
so you can get a feel for what could go on.

155
00:14:28,324 --> 00:14:29,552
It's mine.

156
00:14:30,884 --> 00:14:34,479
- Hello.
- Hi, it's me. Bad timing?

157
00:14:34,564 --> 00:14:37,158
We're in the middle of it, but we're close.

158
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:38,916
What's going on?

159
00:14:39,005 --> 00:14:41,644
The security people haven't shown up yet.

160
00:14:41,724 --> 00:14:44,443
Neither have the police to dust for prints.

161
00:14:44,524 --> 00:14:47,322
- Didyou call them?
- Yeah. I get a run-around.

162
00:14:47,404 --> 00:14:50,521
Great. OK, I tellyou what.
Here's whatyou do.

163
00:14:51,084 --> 00:14:56,283
Call the police and ask to talk to those two
cops from last night. I bet they can help.

164
00:14:56,364 --> 00:14:57,798
Well, OK. I'll try.

165
00:14:57,884 --> 00:15:00,445
I'll be home as soon as I can.
You all right?

166
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,515
Mm-hm. I love you.

167
00:15:02,604 --> 00:15:04,595
- Ilike that!
- Bye.

168
00:15:07,124 --> 00:15:09,354
Michael, I'm being grilled here!

169
00:15:09,445 --> 00:15:12,800
This area's high crime, right?
You get the people in.

170
00:15:12,884 --> 00:15:14,920
How do you keep the bad element out?

171
00:15:15,965 --> 00:15:19,196
I'm into that as we speak.
I'm working on security now.

172
00:15:45,285 --> 00:15:47,593
Michael, you remember Officer Davis?

173
00:15:47,684 --> 00:15:51,472
Oh, yeah! How are you doing?
I didn't recognise you out of uniform.

174
00:15:51,564 --> 00:15:54,317
- You did all this?
- Yeah, it's no big deal.

175
00:15:54,405 --> 00:15:58,113
- It is! We really appreciate it.
- It's the least I could do.

176
00:15:58,204 --> 00:16:00,115
Mrs Carr called my captain

177
00:16:00,205 --> 00:16:04,198
and said all kinds of nice things
about me and my partner, Roy.

178
00:16:04,284 --> 00:16:07,402
- It was nice, I appreciate it.
- Can I get you a beer?

179
00:16:07,484 --> 00:16:09,793
Sure, that would be great. Thanks.

180
00:16:12,685 --> 00:16:16,040
There will be contact switches
on every point of entrance.

181
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:19,959
A breeze won't be able
to get in this house without you knowing!

182
00:16:20,044 --> 00:16:22,878
Here, there will be
an infrared motion detector.

183
00:16:22,964 --> 00:16:26,161
This will detect if
anybody breaks the glass.

184
00:16:26,525 --> 00:16:29,322
Hey! What's he doing in the bathroom here?

185
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,396
Oh.

186
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:35,317
It's just an extra precaution,
it's a safe room.

187
00:16:37,484 --> 00:16:41,239
These old houses have
doors like solid rock.

188
00:16:41,325 --> 00:16:44,158
We put a heavy dead bolt
on each entrance here.

189
00:16:44,245 --> 00:16:49,273
If there's an intruder, just lock
yourself in and wait for the cavalry,

190
00:16:49,365 --> 00:16:50,400
which is us.

191
00:16:54,124 --> 00:16:57,400
Pick out a codeword.
It's got to be seven letters.

192
00:17:03,084 --> 00:17:04,677
Pyramid.

193
00:17:04,764 --> 00:17:06,198
Pyramid?

194
00:17:08,725 --> 00:17:10,680
This is the Michael Carr residence.

195
00:17:10,765 --> 00:17:12,994
The codeword's gonna be pyramid.

196
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:16,315
Right. OK. Thank you.

197
00:17:16,845 --> 00:17:18,642
That's it.

198
00:17:19,725 --> 00:17:21,920
Oh, yeah.

199
00:17:22,005 --> 00:17:24,519
- 440 cubes, 500 horses.
- Jesus!

200
00:17:24,605 --> 00:17:27,676
- Did you do the work yourself?
- Every nut and bolt.

201
00:17:27,765 --> 00:17:30,154
Installed the alarm. It relaxes me.

202
00:17:30,245 --> 00:17:33,840
- That is nice. Really nice.
- Thanks.

203
00:17:36,005 --> 00:17:39,441
Oh, man!
You've got a knack for this security stuff!

204
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:42,641
Do you ever think about
consulting as a sideline?

205
00:17:42,725 --> 00:17:46,115
- Consulting?
- Yeah. Homes, businesses.

206
00:17:46,205 --> 00:17:48,765
I got a club I'm putting together downtown.

207
00:17:48,845 --> 00:17:51,045
What you're doing today,
but you get paid for your time.

208
00:17:51,085 --> 00:17:52,996
I never really thought about it much.

209
00:17:53,085 --> 00:17:55,918
- You're staying for dinner, right?
- Yeah.

210
00:17:56,005 --> 00:17:57,961
- No.
- Are you doing anything?

211
00:17:58,045 --> 00:18:00,035
I'd be crossing the line.

212
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:03,322
Cops on one side,
everybody else on the other.

213
00:18:04,325 --> 00:18:06,316
Come on!

214
00:18:10,165 --> 00:18:13,441
This has really been nice.

215
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:17,803
Usually dinner for me is a bunch of us
telling boring war stories.

216
00:18:17,885 --> 00:18:20,957
Cops stick together
because nobody else could stand us!

217
00:18:21,045 --> 00:18:23,115
- You've never been married?
- No.

218
00:18:23,205 --> 00:18:25,799
She'll try to line you up
with one of her friends.

219
00:18:28,245 --> 00:18:30,804
- I'll get her, Jack.
- Sorry, Michael.

220
00:18:30,885 --> 00:18:33,274
She smells that meat and goes crazy.

221
00:18:33,365 --> 00:18:35,356
Meet me round the front.

222
00:18:35,445 --> 00:18:38,005
I'm sorry. I'm still a little freaked.

223
00:18:39,445 --> 00:18:41,436
That's OK.

224
00:18:41,525 --> 00:18:43,834
That's understandable.

225
00:18:43,925 --> 00:18:47,838
I can't believe
you've never been serious about anyone.

226
00:18:49,845 --> 00:18:51,756
No.

227
00:18:51,845 --> 00:18:55,315
Cops and marriage are a tough combination.

228
00:18:55,405 --> 00:18:56,394
So...

229
00:18:56,485 --> 00:18:58,840
I can't believe how much I'm talking.

230
00:18:58,925 --> 00:19:01,314
When I was a kid, I hardly ever talked.

231
00:19:01,405 --> 00:19:03,680
When I was in school, I nevertalked.

232
00:19:03,765 --> 00:19:04,959
I was famous for it.

233
00:19:05,045 --> 00:19:06,034
Oh.

234
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,763
Take it from a teacher,

235
00:19:07,845 --> 00:19:11,121
we love those quiet boys
in the back ofthe class.

236
00:19:11,206 --> 00:19:14,720
Don't you believe her, Pete!
She loves all kids.

237
00:19:16,965 --> 00:19:18,637
That's what's missing.

238
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:22,320
I'm surprised you two don't have
a few running around.

239
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:27,556
I'm sorry about bringing up...

240
00:19:27,645 --> 00:19:30,285
...kids. It's really none of my business.

241
00:19:30,365 --> 00:19:32,401
Hey, I just wanted to thank you.

242
00:19:32,485 --> 00:19:35,682
You really went out ofyour way.
It did so much for Karen.

243
00:19:35,765 --> 00:19:37,164
She'll bounce back.

244
00:19:37,245 --> 00:19:40,237
She'll bounce back
a lot quicker because ofyou.

245
00:19:40,325 --> 00:19:42,886
What about you? Have you bounced back?

246
00:19:43,925 --> 00:19:45,916
I don't know.

247
00:19:46,005 --> 00:19:49,520
A guy gets his hands on your wife
like that, you feel helpless.

248
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,755
You did what you could, Michael.

249
00:19:51,845 --> 00:19:53,961
You showed a lot of balls.

250
00:19:54,045 --> 00:19:56,036
There was one moment where

251
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:59,401
he had a hold of her
and I had that stupid golf club,

252
00:19:59,486 --> 00:20:01,476
I thought I could just...

253
00:20:02,725 --> 00:20:05,001
I didn't... I didn't take the shot.

254
00:20:05,085 --> 00:20:09,556
A fucking nightmare when you think
about what could have happened.

255
00:20:09,645 --> 00:20:13,002
I wouldn't mind one more shot
at that son of a bitch.

256
00:20:13,085 --> 00:20:15,076
- Really?
- Hell, yeah!

257
00:20:15,165 --> 00:20:17,281
I'd like to kick the shit out of him!

258
00:20:17,365 --> 00:20:19,560
- I'm sure you would.
- Wouldn't you?

259
00:20:19,645 --> 00:20:21,875
Oh, I already know what I would do.

260
00:20:22,245 --> 00:20:25,840
I'm just wondering about
a nice, civilised guy like you.

261
00:20:25,926 --> 00:20:29,999
After what he did to Karen,
I think all the rules are out the window.

262
00:20:30,085 --> 00:20:32,077
I'd rip his fucking heart out.

263
00:20:32,165 --> 00:20:34,076
Michael!

264
00:20:34,165 --> 00:20:36,156
You're a scary guy!

265
00:20:41,925 --> 00:20:43,916
Hey! You know,

266
00:20:44,006 --> 00:20:46,394
you'd enjoy coming on a ride-along.

267
00:20:46,485 --> 00:20:49,523
- What's that?
- Riding along with us on patrol one night.

268
00:20:49,605 --> 00:20:53,121
- You can do that?
- We often do for writers, journalists...

269
00:20:53,205 --> 00:20:54,878
Uh-huh. It sounds...

270
00:20:54,966 --> 00:20:56,683
Yeah, I could do that.

271
00:20:56,766 --> 00:21:00,280
Great. I'm gonna set it up.
You come watch us kick some butt.

272
00:21:00,366 --> 00:21:03,756
- When do you want to do it?
- Tomorrow.

273
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,235
Come on. It'll be fun.

274
00:21:06,326 --> 00:21:08,236
Yeah. Why not?

275
00:21:08,325 --> 00:21:10,156
Great. I'll see you then.

276
00:21:22,326 --> 00:21:27,002
Sign it, so your old lady can't come after
the City ifyou get killed or maimed.

277
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:29,394
Nothing will happen to him. He's with me.

278
00:21:30,005 --> 00:21:31,325
Hey, Pete.

279
00:21:34,325 --> 00:21:38,319
OK, Mike. A dope dealer,
a public defender and my ex-wife

280
00:21:38,406 --> 00:21:41,443
all get thrown offthe
Empire State Building.

281
00:21:41,525 --> 00:21:43,756
Which one hits the cement first?

282
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:46,040
I don't know. Who lands first?

283
00:21:46,126 --> 00:21:48,117
Who cares!

284
00:21:50,566 --> 00:21:52,237
Oh, oh, oh!

285
00:21:52,325 --> 00:21:54,316
Oh, my gosh, look at this!

286
00:21:54,406 --> 00:21:57,000
Do you think she's a real blonde, Roy?

287
00:22:03,326 --> 00:22:05,122
Officer.

288
00:22:05,206 --> 00:22:07,196
Was I going too fast?

289
00:22:07,286 --> 00:22:10,483
Do you have a licence and a registration,
ma'am?

290
00:22:10,565 --> 00:22:12,556
Yes.

291
00:22:12,645 --> 00:22:15,921
Certain types ofwomen
just have a thing for cops.

292
00:22:16,006 --> 00:22:18,315
They think we're like movie stars.

293
00:22:43,286 --> 00:22:46,323
If we were to search
any one ofthese assholes,

294
00:22:46,405 --> 00:22:49,079
we'd be up to our butts in drugs and guns.

295
00:22:49,165 --> 00:22:51,964
This place is one giant
supermarket of shit.

296
00:22:52,046 --> 00:22:55,243
- Right, Leon?
- Whatever you say, Officer Pete.

297
00:22:55,326 --> 00:22:58,602
- This is Mr Clean here.
- That's right, that's me.

298
00:22:58,686 --> 00:23:00,358
Yes, sir. Mr Clean.

299
00:23:02,326 --> 00:23:03,918
Maria! Como esta?

300
00:23:04,006 --> 00:23:05,724
Yeah!

301
00:23:05,806 --> 00:23:07,682
Everything OK? No problemas?

302
00:23:07,766 --> 00:23:08,960
No, no problemas.

303
00:23:09,046 --> 00:23:11,037
If there is, let me know, OK?

304
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:18,157
You won't be finding any clientele
for your club around here, Michael.

305
00:23:24,926 --> 00:23:27,486
Try it. The best in LA.

306
00:23:27,566 --> 00:23:29,716
You know, I ate before I came out.

307
00:23:29,806 --> 00:23:31,797
I'm really full.

308
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:36,162
So, are you enjoying yourself?

309
00:23:36,246 --> 00:23:39,124
Yeah. Yeah, it's an eye-opener.

310
00:23:39,206 --> 00:23:44,234
Something occurred to me when you were
at the house for the barbecue, Pete.

311
00:23:44,326 --> 00:23:46,886
I don't know how it works
here in Los Angeles.

312
00:23:46,966 --> 00:23:48,524
When I was in Phoenix,

313
00:23:48,606 --> 00:23:52,235
I used to hire off-duty police officers
to ward the club.

314
00:23:52,326 --> 00:23:55,318
Hear that? Mike's offering us
moonlighting money.

315
00:23:55,406 --> 00:23:57,397
- I'd like to talk to you...
- Hi.

316
00:23:57,486 --> 00:23:58,999
Hi.

317
00:23:59,086 --> 00:24:00,917
So, how are you?

318
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,474
Are you like a captain, or something?

319
00:24:03,926 --> 00:24:05,917
Lieutenant.

320
00:24:07,286 --> 00:24:09,242
Come on, vamonos!

321
00:24:09,326 --> 00:24:12,045
Can't you see the lieutenant's married?

322
00:24:12,126 --> 00:24:14,117
Oh, yeah? Oh.

323
00:24:14,206 --> 00:24:16,197
Oh, well. Ya me voy.

324
00:24:16,286 --> 00:24:19,642
- Bye, Pete.
- See you later, Rosa.

325
00:24:19,726 --> 00:24:21,921
These bitches can't get enough of us.

326
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,917
Michael, stay here.

327
00:24:36,366 --> 00:24:38,357
Keep away!

328
00:24:41,526 --> 00:24:43,482
Police! Everything all right in there?

329
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:45,557
No! Everything is not all right!

330
00:24:45,647 --> 00:24:48,399
Fucking asshole jailbird
is on the fucking bed!

331
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:50,442
Fuck you, fuck you.

332
00:25:05,366 --> 00:25:07,881
There you go. Are you all right?

333
00:25:08,286 --> 00:25:11,244
Come on, boy.
Why don't you stay here with me?

334
00:25:11,326 --> 00:25:13,556
Roy, I'm taking him out.

335
00:25:13,646 --> 00:25:18,481
Take that piece of shit
back to the jailhouse where he belongs!

336
00:25:19,286 --> 00:25:21,641
Mom! Mommy!

337
00:25:29,046 --> 00:25:31,606
See? They got him.

338
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:45,765
Roy, why don't you go
and get yourself cleaned up?

339
00:25:45,846 --> 00:25:48,201
Me and Michael will put the car to bed.

340
00:25:48,286 --> 00:25:50,277
It works for me.

341
00:25:50,367 --> 00:25:52,517
- Later, gentlemen.
- Take care.

342
00:25:56,926 --> 00:25:58,996
It's a hell of a life, huh, Mike?

343
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:02,044
- Is it always like this?
- Day in and day out.

344
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:04,117
Come on. Hop up in front.

345
00:26:05,887 --> 00:26:09,323
Your wife wants to know
why I can't meet a nice woman.

346
00:26:10,047 --> 00:26:12,958
I thought you guys handled
it all pretty well.

347
00:26:13,047 --> 00:26:15,162
Where are we headed?

348
00:26:15,246 --> 00:26:17,476
Just got one more errand to run.

349
00:26:28,007 --> 00:26:29,918
Come on! Move!

350
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:31,281
Michael!

351
00:26:35,367 --> 00:26:36,481
Stay there.

352
00:26:36,567 --> 00:26:39,604
Michael. Meet Ernie Pike.

353
00:26:39,686 --> 00:26:41,803
Come out and ID this piece of shit.

354
00:26:41,887 --> 00:26:43,878
Come on, motherfucker!

355
00:26:44,767 --> 00:26:47,804
That's him!
You got him, goddamn! That's him.

356
00:26:47,886 --> 00:26:50,320
Did you hear that? You've just been made.

357
00:26:51,326 --> 00:26:53,476
You've just been made, scumbag!

358
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:58,361
Picked up a crackhead pal of his.
Turned in Pike here.

359
00:26:59,206 --> 00:27:01,926
You broke into my friend's house? Huh?

360
00:27:02,007 --> 00:27:04,475
Did you scare him and his pretty wife?

361
00:27:04,606 --> 00:27:06,677
Did you do that? Did you do that?

362
00:27:06,767 --> 00:27:09,998
OK. I'm sorry, man. OK?

363
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:12,078
Fuck off!

364
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:15,397
He doesn't want to hear you're sorry.

365
00:27:16,486 --> 00:27:18,478
He wants to kick your ass!

366
00:27:18,566 --> 00:27:20,558
Guess what, scumbag?

367
00:27:20,646 --> 00:27:22,638
I'm gonna let him.

368
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:26,445
- Ready?
- What?

369
00:27:26,527 --> 00:27:28,483
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

370
00:27:28,567 --> 00:27:30,443
Are you serious?

371
00:27:30,527 --> 00:27:33,564
Yeah! You said you wanted
to rip his fucking heart out!

372
00:27:33,646 --> 00:27:35,443
Well, yeah, yeah.

373
00:27:35,527 --> 00:27:38,644
But, I mean, that was... just talking.

374
00:27:38,727 --> 00:27:40,637
Tell him. Say it!

375
00:27:40,726 --> 00:27:43,115
Say how you wanted that uptown pussy.

376
00:27:43,206 --> 00:27:46,324
- Is that what you wanted? Say it!
- No, man.

377
00:27:46,407 --> 00:27:49,524
Say it! Tell him!

378
00:27:49,607 --> 00:27:51,563
Whatever you say, man.

379
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:53,600
Come here!

380
00:27:53,687 --> 00:27:55,678
Don't fucking resist me!

381
00:27:55,767 --> 00:27:57,758
Don't you resist me!

382
00:27:59,367 --> 00:28:01,358
Now, walk!

383
00:28:01,447 --> 00:28:03,438
I said walk.

384
00:28:04,847 --> 00:28:09,158
I just gave you the OK.
You don't even have to touch him.

385
00:28:09,247 --> 00:28:11,635
I wasn't going to hurt nobody, man.

386
00:28:11,727 --> 00:28:13,319
Shut up.

387
00:28:13,407 --> 00:28:16,797
Come on!
Come on, Michael. It's OK, listen.

388
00:28:16,887 --> 00:28:19,526
He resisted, he gets hit. Shit happens.

389
00:28:19,607 --> 00:28:21,597
Come on, Pete. You got him.

390
00:28:21,687 --> 00:28:23,564
Nice going. Just take him in.

391
00:28:23,647 --> 00:28:27,037
Michael... He put a knife
to Karen's throat.

392
00:28:27,127 --> 00:28:30,038
Are you going to let him
get away with that?

393
00:28:30,127 --> 00:28:31,526
Come on! Hit the motherfucker!

394
00:28:31,607 --> 00:28:33,403
- Pete...
- Hit him!

395
00:28:33,487 --> 00:28:34,966
He's just...

396
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,038
Hey, no. I'm not doing this.

397
00:28:37,727 --> 00:28:39,717
Hey!

398
00:28:43,207 --> 00:28:45,323
Motherfucker!

399
00:28:47,167 --> 00:28:50,239
Pete! Pete! Jesus, that's enough!

400
00:29:04,607 --> 00:29:06,598
Honey?

401
00:29:07,447 --> 00:29:09,039
Michael?

402
00:29:09,127 --> 00:29:11,721
Yeah. It's me.

403
00:29:18,847 --> 00:29:20,838
How did it go?

404
00:29:23,047 --> 00:29:25,038
Boy, what a screwed-up night.

405
00:29:25,127 --> 00:29:26,640
What happened?

406
00:29:26,727 --> 00:29:28,718
It was just... It was weird.

407
00:29:30,167 --> 00:29:34,080
I went with the guys on a few calls.
Got to watch them be cops.

408
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:39,882
We dropped Roy off
and Pete had a little surprise for me.

409
00:29:40,207 --> 00:29:41,879
The guy who broke in here.

410
00:29:41,967 --> 00:29:44,686
- He caught him?
- He did a little more than that.

411
00:29:44,767 --> 00:29:48,043
- The guy's in jail?
- Hospital's more likely.

412
00:29:48,128 --> 00:29:53,076
He beat the living shit out ofthis guy,
which is what I was supposed to do.

413
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:56,638
- I don't understand.
- Pete was showing offfor me.

414
00:29:56,727 --> 00:30:00,606
He had it all set up, so I could be
the big man and nail the guy.

415
00:30:00,687 --> 00:30:02,643
Michael, I'm just glad it's over.

416
00:30:02,727 --> 00:30:04,126
Yeah.

417
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:09,838
Are you sure you're OK?

418
00:30:09,927 --> 00:30:11,918
Yeah.

419
00:30:13,927 --> 00:30:15,918
What's the matter, huh?

420
00:30:16,727 --> 00:30:18,718
Just...

421
00:30:18,807 --> 00:30:23,039
I think our cop friend
is a little too tightly wound, that's all.

422
00:30:23,128 --> 00:30:26,564
Do you think you might be
overreacting a little bit?

423
00:30:27,167 --> 00:30:29,159
Not really.

424
00:30:30,087 --> 00:30:32,840
I feel like a big weight's been lifted.

425
00:30:32,927 --> 00:30:35,283
Yeah. I'm glad you feel better.

426
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:38,245
But I'm serious.
I don't want him here any more.

427
00:30:38,328 --> 00:30:40,158
You're upset and I understand,

428
00:30:40,247 --> 00:30:43,239
but shouldn't we give him
the benefit ofthe doubt?

429
00:30:43,328 --> 00:30:46,478
Maybe he got rough,
but you're acting like Pete's the criminal.

430
00:30:46,567 --> 00:30:49,604
Am I? L was there, Karen. I saw it.

431
00:30:49,688 --> 00:30:52,884
I don't care what you think.
We stay away from this guy.

432
00:30:52,967 --> 00:30:54,958
You don't care what I think?

433
00:30:55,047 --> 00:30:57,038
Fine. I won't bother thinking.

434
00:30:57,127 --> 00:30:59,402
- Knock it off.
- No, you knock it off!

435
00:30:59,487 --> 00:31:02,286
I'm sorry, but I don't share your sympathy

436
00:31:02,367 --> 00:31:06,440
for the man who broke in here
and put a goddamn knife to my throat.

437
00:32:03,327 --> 00:32:05,762
Hi. Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

438
00:32:05,847 --> 00:32:07,997
It's OK.

439
00:32:08,087 --> 00:32:11,000
Can I talk to you for a minute? Please?

440
00:32:11,087 --> 00:32:13,079
Just let me get my robe.

441
00:32:23,328 --> 00:32:26,046
You really should put a lock on that gate.

442
00:32:27,447 --> 00:32:30,485
I don't think you came here
to discuss my gate.

443
00:32:30,568 --> 00:32:32,559
No.

444
00:32:34,808 --> 00:32:37,197
Did you hear I arrested the burglar?

445
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,278
What happened?

446
00:32:40,128 --> 00:32:43,404
What happened was
the burglar knocked me down

447
00:32:43,487 --> 00:32:45,285
and took off running.

448
00:32:45,368 --> 00:32:47,598
When I caught him, he resisted

449
00:32:47,688 --> 00:32:49,644
and it got ugly.

450
00:32:49,728 --> 00:32:52,288
I don't think Michael took it too well.

451
00:32:52,368 --> 00:32:54,518
He didn't quite put it that way.

452
00:32:55,688 --> 00:32:58,156
It's not a TV show out there, Mrs Carr.

453
00:32:58,248 --> 00:33:01,842
The reality gets to people
who've never seen it up close.

454
00:33:01,928 --> 00:33:03,919
You mean the violence.

455
00:33:05,928 --> 00:33:07,919
Look,

456
00:33:09,328 --> 00:33:11,319
when I first started out,

457
00:33:11,407 --> 00:33:13,399
I went on a routine call.

458
00:33:14,408 --> 00:33:16,717
There was a young kid high on drugs.

459
00:33:16,807 --> 00:33:19,038
He was beating on his girlfriend.

460
00:33:19,608 --> 00:33:22,486
She couldn't have been more than 15, 16,

461
00:33:22,568 --> 00:33:25,128
sweet girl, blonde hair, blue eyes.

462
00:33:25,208 --> 00:33:27,517
So I didn't pay her much attention.

463
00:33:28,328 --> 00:33:30,716
I was reading the kid his rights,

464
00:33:31,607 --> 00:33:35,043
when she took out a gun
and she shot me right here

465
00:33:35,128 --> 00:33:37,119
in the chest.

466
00:33:38,488 --> 00:33:41,366
Now I restrain felons first
with whatever it takes.

467
00:33:41,448 --> 00:33:44,918
With whatever it takes.
That's how it was last night.

468
00:33:45,008 --> 00:33:49,160
I don't need another bullet in the chest,
you don't need a dead husband.

469
00:33:49,248 --> 00:33:51,478
I'm very sorry if Michael's upset.

470
00:33:51,568 --> 00:33:53,559
I was just doing myjob.

471
00:33:53,648 --> 00:33:55,764
Pete... Pete, wait.

472
00:34:00,928 --> 00:34:02,919
I'm glad you got him.

473
00:34:05,208 --> 00:34:10,521
That guy's not going to forget the night
he made the mistake of breaking in here!

474
00:34:12,408 --> 00:34:14,399
OK. Enjoy your swim.

475
00:34:38,928 --> 00:34:40,919
This is the Chromalight.

476
00:34:41,008 --> 00:34:45,559
It's the backdrop to the dance floor,
which could also spill out onto this floor.

477
00:34:45,648 --> 00:34:48,560
With this Chromalight,
we can create any environment.

478
00:34:48,648 --> 00:34:52,482
This is a cityscape but we can create
a desert, a mountain... anything.

479
00:34:57,888 --> 00:35:01,676
Why didn't I know Michael
had so many good-looking friends?

480
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:04,487
Are you kidding?
We don't know any ofthese people.

481
00:35:04,568 --> 00:35:08,038
They're potential investors
or friends of Michael's lawyer.

482
00:35:10,008 --> 00:35:12,000
That's too bad!

483
00:35:13,248 --> 00:35:15,398
Now, there's one I'd like to meet.

484
00:35:17,288 --> 00:35:19,848
That's the guy I was telling you about.

485
00:35:19,928 --> 00:35:21,919
Your cop? Really?

486
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:33,126
- Candace said the music is too loud.
- What? Who?

487
00:35:33,209 --> 00:35:35,676
- Candace, my wife.
- I like it like this.

488
00:35:35,768 --> 00:35:38,077
Roger, I got a question
only you can answer.

489
00:35:38,168 --> 00:35:42,639
I got an IRS auditor and a lawyer
on top ofthe World Trade Center.

490
00:35:42,728 --> 00:35:44,958
They both jump off at the same time.

491
00:35:45,048 --> 00:35:47,039
- Who lands first?
- Who cares!

492
00:35:47,128 --> 00:35:48,959
Hi! How are you doing, Mike?

493
00:35:49,048 --> 00:35:50,038
Pete.

494
00:35:50,128 --> 00:35:52,120
This place is great.

495
00:35:52,208 --> 00:35:54,200
Thanks.

496
00:35:55,209 --> 00:35:57,199
Pete Davis, Los Angeles Police.

497
00:35:57,368 --> 00:35:58,960
Hello, Pete. Jerry Lurie.

498
00:35:59,048 --> 00:36:00,720
- My wife Candace.
- Hi, Pete.

499
00:36:00,808 --> 00:36:01,718
Roger Graham.

500
00:36:01,808 --> 00:36:04,481
Mike's been talking to
me about club security.

501
00:36:04,568 --> 00:36:06,957
Are you working the area tonight?

502
00:36:07,048 --> 00:36:10,927
No... I did the precheck ofthe exterior.

503
00:36:12,688 --> 00:36:17,808
I know it's normal to have your entrance
under the marquee, but it's too open.

504
00:36:17,889 --> 00:36:22,565
It would be better to put the entrance
in the alley and make the people line up.

505
00:36:22,648 --> 00:36:26,562
So ifwe ever have to get heavy,
only a few people will see it.

506
00:36:26,648 --> 00:36:28,640
Something to think about.

507
00:36:30,209 --> 00:36:34,600
Why don't you get yourself a drink
and I'll be with you in a minute?

508
00:36:35,088 --> 00:36:38,206
Good idea.
I know you have business to discuss.

509
00:36:38,288 --> 00:36:39,846
I'll fill you in later.

510
00:36:39,929 --> 00:36:41,680
Take care. Nice meeting you.

511
00:36:41,768 --> 00:36:44,283
He makes a lot of sense.

512
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:47,486
You guys really aren't bullshitting.

513
00:36:48,049 --> 00:36:51,518
- I take security very seriously.
- We're really on top of it.

514
00:36:52,408 --> 00:36:54,160
Hi there.

515
00:36:54,248 --> 00:36:56,239
Oh, Penny. This is Pete.

516
00:36:56,328 --> 00:36:58,364
- Pete, Penny.
- Hi. Nice meeting you.

517
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:00,326
Hi, nice meeting you.

518
00:37:00,409 --> 00:37:03,879
- We teach together.
- Oh! Oh...

519
00:37:03,969 --> 00:37:07,848
The pupils would be so impressed
that I'm talking to you. They love cops.

520
00:37:07,928 --> 00:37:10,601
They're young. Give them time!

521
00:37:11,648 --> 00:37:14,561
Maybe you'd like
to give them a talk some time?

522
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,047
Erm...

523
00:37:16,129 --> 00:37:17,447
Yeah, sure.

524
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:20,123
Public relations love stuff like that.

525
00:37:20,208 --> 00:37:23,121
Speaking of public relations, do you dance?

526
00:37:23,209 --> 00:37:25,404
Honey! Can you rescue Roger for me?

527
00:37:25,488 --> 00:37:26,637
Hi, Penny.

528
00:37:26,728 --> 00:37:28,845
Come on, Pete. Let's get that drink.

529
00:37:29,928 --> 00:37:31,919
Here's to your club, Mike.

530
00:37:32,889 --> 00:37:33,958
Pete.

531
00:37:34,048 --> 00:37:36,517
I want to get something straight here.

532
00:37:36,609 --> 00:37:38,041
I'd like you to leave.

533
00:37:38,129 --> 00:37:40,484
Michael, what is with you tonight?

534
00:37:40,568 --> 00:37:42,799
Why did you even invite me here?

535
00:37:42,889 --> 00:37:47,360
Telling you and inviting you
are two completely different things.

536
00:37:47,449 --> 00:37:49,440
You seem so uptight. Relax!

537
00:37:49,529 --> 00:37:52,248
Is it because you were up late last night?

538
00:37:52,328 --> 00:37:54,319
How do you know that?

539
00:37:54,408 --> 00:37:58,118
I drove past your house on patrol
and saw your lights were on.

540
00:37:58,209 --> 00:37:59,926
You went to bed after three.

541
00:38:00,009 --> 00:38:03,001
You don't have to protect us now.
You caught him.

542
00:38:03,089 --> 00:38:05,727
One guy's caught and you think that's it?

543
00:38:05,809 --> 00:38:09,245
You saw how much evil shit
there is out there.

544
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:13,402
What kind offriend would I be
if I didn't try to protect you and Karen?

545
00:38:13,488 --> 00:38:17,562
Goddammit, you listen to me,
cos I'm telling you, leave us alone!

546
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:22,887
You know, I think I understand
where this is coming from.

547
00:38:22,969 --> 00:38:25,688
- Do you?
- Just cut the shit, OK?

548
00:38:26,049 --> 00:38:30,041
Nobody expects you to be me. I'm a cop.

549
00:38:30,129 --> 00:38:32,643
I make my living tackling guys like Pike.

550
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:34,719
You don't. You needn't be ashamed.

551
00:38:34,809 --> 00:38:36,720
- You think this is about that?
- Yeah.

552
00:38:36,809 --> 00:38:40,722
I bet you had one hell of a night
last night when you got home.

553
00:38:40,809 --> 00:38:43,039
Juices flowing and everything.

554
00:38:43,129 --> 00:38:45,085
A friend would be thanking me.

555
00:38:45,168 --> 00:38:48,684
I'm not your friend.
I'm nothing to you. You got that?

556
00:38:48,768 --> 00:38:52,239
You're a sick guy.
I don't want you around me or my wife.

557
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:55,207
- Michael, your guests...
- I'll be there in a second.

558
00:38:55,289 --> 00:38:58,599
Michael needs
to get some things off his chest.

559
00:38:58,689 --> 00:39:00,441
- Roger...
- Honey, please!

560
00:39:00,528 --> 00:39:03,487
- Are you kicking me out?
- Don't keep them waiting.

561
00:39:03,568 --> 00:39:05,161
If I have to.

562
00:39:05,249 --> 00:39:07,888
Tell Roger I'll be there in a second, OK?

563
00:39:15,009 --> 00:39:17,000
What are you gonna do?

564
00:39:17,729 --> 00:39:20,084
Call the cops?

565
00:39:21,049 --> 00:39:22,118
Get the fuck out.

566
00:39:22,209 --> 00:39:23,164
Lower your voice.

567
00:39:23,249 --> 00:39:25,763
Fuck you. Fuck you!

568
00:39:25,849 --> 00:39:27,840
The pigeon's watching.

569
00:39:31,649 --> 00:39:33,844
I hope he doesn't fly away on you.

570
00:40:03,209 --> 00:40:05,200
Can I get your car?

571
00:40:06,449 --> 00:40:08,440
Ticket.

572
00:40:13,889 --> 00:40:16,767
Weren't you a little rough on Pete?

573
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:20,637
I don't want him coming round.
I wanted to make that clear.

574
00:40:20,729 --> 00:40:22,765
- You succeeded.
- Honey, please.

575
00:40:22,849 --> 00:40:24,999
Come on, it's time for our toast.

576
00:40:33,649 --> 00:40:36,846
Good health, good fortune,
and the time to enjoy it.

577
00:40:36,929 --> 00:40:38,920
It's an old Castilian toast.

578
00:40:41,409 --> 00:40:45,721
It looks like you've just
made these two people very happy.

579
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:49,086
I think we'll all have reason to be happy

580
00:40:49,169 --> 00:40:51,637
when everything falls in place, Roger.

581
00:40:53,929 --> 00:40:55,920
That is a nice ride!

582
00:41:01,689 --> 00:41:06,127
To the most charming women here!
Your beautiful wife and mine.

583
00:42:10,289 --> 00:42:12,280
I'm glad you called.

584
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:15,887
I've been thinking about you a lot lately.

585
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:27,561
Leave it.

586
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:30,321
Sorry.

587
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:33,320
Still sensitive, huh?

588
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:38,399
Did you get shot or something?

589
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:43,721
It was a fishing accident.

590
00:42:44,569 --> 00:42:46,560
Yeah!

591
00:42:46,649 --> 00:42:48,640
Fishes with guns.

592
00:42:55,929 --> 00:42:57,920
Are you all right?

593
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:01,321
Cos we can go to a motel.

594
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:03,401
A nice, cosy bed

595
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:05,481
if you're having a problem.

596
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:08,481
Problem...

597
00:43:19,689 --> 00:43:22,204
The only problem that I have

598
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:26,722
is sleazy, lowlife whores like you.

599
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:30,319
That's my problem.

600
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:33,486
What the hell's wrong with you?

601
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:36,003
- Get out.
- I'm not getting out here!

602
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:38,684
- Get the fuck out!
- Are you crazy?

603
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:43,241
- I don't know where the fuck I am!
- That's exactly your fucking problem!

604
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:45,561
Isn't it?

605
00:43:57,810 --> 00:44:02,121
So, being a policeman
is reallyallabouthelpingpeople.

606
00:44:02,729 --> 00:44:04,721
It's about being a friend.

607
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:08,007
It's not about shooting
it out with bad guys,

608
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:10,081
that's what you see on TV.

609
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:12,730
That's not why I wanted to become a cop.

610
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:15,768
I wanted to become a cop to protect people,

611
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:19,081
to make them feel happy and safe.

612
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:21,889
- Everybody understand that?
- Yes.

613
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:24,165
Anybody have any questions?

614
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:26,844
- What?
- Do you wear bulletproof vests?

615
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:28,841
I have to, to protect myself.

616
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:30,329
Who else?

617
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:33,607
In the police car,
are you always with somebody?

618
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:36,568
I have a partner.
His name is Officer Roy Cole.

619
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:40,404
We've spent time together
for the past seven, eight years.

620
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:42,446
He's a very good friend of mine.

621
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:43,519
OK, you.

622
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:46,124
Could you show me
how to use your handcuffs?

623
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:47,723
Sure.

624
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,641
Come here.

625
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:51,721
- What's your name?
- Matthew.

626
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:53,163
All right, Matthew.

627
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:54,683
Put your hands out.

628
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:59,088
Do you think I could get him
to use those on me?

629
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:02,162
There you go.
You're under arrest, Matthew!

630
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:11,720
Hi. I couldn't go without saying thanks
for letting me impress the kids.

631
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:14,688
- It was a lot offun.
- Penny really set it up.

632
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:16,840
Yeah, I talked to Penny before.

633
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:20,643
I'd like to apologise for the other night.

634
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:23,847
- Michael's behaviour...
- It took me by surprise.

635
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:27,206
He invited me and kicked me out.
I would never have come.

636
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:29,281
Pete, it's not you, it's him.

637
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:31,361
He's not been himself lately.

638
00:45:32,651 --> 00:45:35,118
Would you like to go get a cup of coffee?

639
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:37,201
I... don't go on for a while.

640
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:39,485
I don't think it's such a good idea.

641
00:45:39,571 --> 00:45:42,767
Come on, you're safe with me.
I'm a cop, remember!

642
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:45,569
- Just for a little while?
- Yeah. Just...

643
00:45:53,811 --> 00:45:55,801
Is everybody in here a cop?

644
00:45:55,891 --> 00:45:57,881
Yeah, pretty much.

645
00:45:57,971 --> 00:46:00,643
About a year ago,
some jerk came in here

646
00:46:00,731 --> 00:46:02,960
and tried to rip this place off!

647
00:46:04,331 --> 00:46:07,721
When he finally come
crashing through the skylight,

648
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:09,802
I say, "How's your dick?"

649
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:12,529
I'm sorry. We should go somewhere else.

650
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:15,044
- No, this is great.
- Really?

651
00:46:15,131 --> 00:46:18,327
I think it's really nice
you've got a place to go.

652
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:20,401
I'd like one. Just...

653
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:22,686
This is...

654
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:25,568
This is my least favourite time ofthe day.

655
00:46:25,651 --> 00:46:27,959
- Why?
- Erm...

656
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:31,805
I guess it's getting dark out
and Michael's not home yet.

657
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:36,119
How did you and Michael get together?

658
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:41,648
- I was a waitress in his first club.
- Really?

659
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:45,040
- You were a waitress?
- It was the firstjob I ever had.

660
00:46:45,131 --> 00:46:47,121
The first one I needed.

661
00:46:48,331 --> 00:46:50,322
We were kind ofwell off.

662
00:46:50,411 --> 00:46:54,961
My father, as it turned out,
had sort of gambling problems.

663
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:57,041
And I, erm...

664
00:46:57,130 --> 00:47:01,203
People started coming over
and taking our cars in the night.

665
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:03,326
It was kind of a scary time.

666
00:47:03,411 --> 00:47:05,640
Did Michael take you away from all that?

667
00:47:05,731 --> 00:47:09,280
Things always came really
easily to Michael.

668
00:47:09,371 --> 00:47:11,362
Is that why you married him?

669
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:18,248
I married him because I
fell in love with him.

670
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:26,921
This is...

671
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:30,121
I hardly know you

672
00:47:30,211 --> 00:47:32,281
and we're talking like this.

673
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:36,284
Karen, all the things
that come so easily to Michael,

674
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:38,362
were you one ofthem?

675
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:41,442
Cos no man deserves
that much good fortune.

676
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:43,919
And I mean that.

677
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:47,526
A woman like you,
a man should never take for granted.

678
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:50,803
And you should never feel unsafe.

679
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:53,489
And I want you to know,

680
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:56,131
that ifyou ever need anything,

681
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:59,965
you're feeling bad in any way
or you just need to talk,

682
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:02,519
then I'm there for you.

683
00:48:02,611 --> 00:48:04,602
OK? As a friend.

684
00:48:04,691 --> 00:48:07,000
As a real friend, I'm there for you.

685
00:48:09,531 --> 00:48:11,522
OK?

686
00:48:14,531 --> 00:48:15,930
Come on.

687
00:48:16,011 --> 00:48:18,002
Let me get you out of here.

688
00:48:58,531 --> 00:49:00,522
How was your afternoon?

689
00:49:00,611 --> 00:49:02,602
Hey, good. It was fine.

690
00:49:04,131 --> 00:49:06,361
You and Mrs Carr getting along OK?

691
00:49:14,331 --> 00:49:16,606
We seem to be.

692
00:49:21,571 --> 00:49:23,402
When I was a kid at Erasmus,

693
00:49:23,491 --> 00:49:27,245
I didn't have a single teacher
that looked like Karen.

694
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:31,643
They all had blue hair with names
like Mushbutt or Silvercrone.

695
00:49:33,651 --> 00:49:35,801
Silvercrone's my maiden name.

696
00:49:38,931 --> 00:49:40,922
She had me!

697
00:49:43,091 --> 00:49:46,481
The good news is Frank Taft
was so taken with you,

698
00:49:46,571 --> 00:49:49,210
he's considering kicking
in halfthe capital.

699
00:49:49,291 --> 00:49:52,488
- Frank Taft... Blue Moon Records?
- We handle him.

700
00:49:52,571 --> 00:49:55,210
- That company's on a roll.
- Major roll.

701
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:57,168
I don't listen to that shit myself...

702
00:49:57,251 --> 00:49:59,401
Sorry, sir. Do you have another card?

703
00:49:59,491 --> 00:50:01,686
- What's the problem?
- It's cancelled.

704
00:50:01,771 --> 00:50:03,887
It's impossible.

705
00:50:03,971 --> 00:50:06,007
Computer glitch. It happens to me.

706
00:50:06,091 --> 00:50:08,127
This is... It's unbelievable.

707
00:50:08,211 --> 00:50:10,281
Relax, you'll get the next one.

708
00:50:13,971 --> 00:50:16,769
All right, now we're on for Tuesday night.

709
00:50:16,851 --> 00:50:19,081
- Bye!
- Take care.

710
00:50:19,171 --> 00:50:21,162
Michael, what's that?

711
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:24,527
It looks like you're having a bad night,
Michael.

712
00:50:28,611 --> 00:50:31,967
All lknowis what's on
the computerprintout.

713
00:50:32,051 --> 00:50:34,645
It says you have
parking tickets up the wazoo.

714
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:36,528
And the computer is wrong.

715
00:50:36,611 --> 00:50:39,284
I'm not paying $600
for tickets I didn't get.

716
00:50:39,371 --> 00:50:41,327
I've been working here five years.

717
00:50:41,411 --> 00:50:43,402
The computer's never wrong.

718
00:50:43,491 --> 00:50:46,369
Do you want the boot
taken offyour car or not?

719
00:50:47,251 --> 00:50:49,322
Unbelievable.

720
00:50:51,491 --> 00:50:53,483
Wait a minute, not that one.

721
00:50:56,452 --> 00:50:58,521
Honey, are you sure about this?

722
00:50:58,611 --> 00:51:01,887
Remember the night
we went to the Minzers' house?

723
00:51:01,972 --> 00:51:04,360
They had the party on Canyon Avenue.

724
00:51:04,451 --> 00:51:07,648
I got a ticket, one ticket.
$600? Come on, Jesus!

725
00:51:07,771 --> 00:51:10,490
Sorry, pal, you're over
the limit on this card.

726
00:51:18,131 --> 00:51:21,329
It's a computer thing, like Roger said.

727
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,402
Yeah, all right.

728
00:51:25,411 --> 00:51:27,687
$600.

729
00:51:27,771 --> 00:51:31,161
Michael, drop it!
Things went pretty well, didn't they?

730
00:51:31,251 --> 00:51:33,812
- Yeah.
- I thought they went pretty good.

731
00:51:33,891 --> 00:51:36,041
You know what?

732
00:51:36,132 --> 00:51:38,726
They went great.

733
00:51:40,251 --> 00:51:44,803
- You really charmed the pants off Lurie.
- Oh, please!

734
00:51:44,891 --> 00:51:46,883
Thanks.

735
00:52:48,372 --> 00:52:50,124
Stay here and lock the door.

736
00:52:50,211 --> 00:52:51,884
- What are you doing?
- Do it!

737
00:53:17,132 --> 00:53:18,929
Karen, it's all right.

738
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,522
Hello, yes.

739
00:53:23,612 --> 00:53:25,409
This is Michael Carr.

740
00:53:25,491 --> 00:53:28,290
Codeword is pyramid.

741
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:31,409
We just had our cat
knock over a screen door.

742
00:53:31,492 --> 00:53:33,210
Thank you. Bye.

743
00:53:34,931 --> 00:53:37,730
I never thought I'd be so happy to see him.

744
00:53:44,132 --> 00:53:46,599
I thought it was the right thing to do.

745
00:53:46,692 --> 00:53:50,605
Thank you for making that decision
for both of us without my having a say.

746
00:53:50,691 --> 00:53:53,252
Goddammit, you know how I feel about guns!

747
00:53:53,332 --> 00:53:57,006
You know how I feel watching a man
come into my home and attack my wife?

748
00:53:57,092 --> 00:53:59,810
I won't be in that position again, Karen.

749
00:54:01,692 --> 00:54:05,287
I don't care what the police say.
I'm keeping that gun.

750
00:54:08,332 --> 00:54:10,641
I'm sorry. I should have told you.

751
00:54:14,611 --> 00:54:16,603
Are you all right?

752
00:54:16,691 --> 00:54:18,171
Yeah.

753
00:54:18,252 --> 00:54:19,844
Are you?

754
00:55:29,812 --> 00:55:31,803
Jesus Christ!

755
00:55:31,892 --> 00:55:33,883
Just a goddamn minute! Hey!

756
00:55:34,492 --> 00:55:36,323
What the fuck are you doing?

757
00:55:36,412 --> 00:55:39,210
I was responding to your alarm, Michael.

758
00:55:39,292 --> 00:55:42,011
- Bullshit! You tripped it yourself!
- What?

759
00:55:42,092 --> 00:55:45,641
And the credit card and the boot on my car!
You did that, didn't you?

760
00:55:45,732 --> 00:55:49,042
- Is everything all right?
- It's fine. Just a false alarm.

761
00:55:49,132 --> 00:55:50,929
False alarm, my ass!

762
00:55:51,012 --> 00:55:52,809
I'm embarrassed about this, too.

763
00:55:52,892 --> 00:55:54,848
Get the fuck out of my house!

764
00:55:55,932 --> 00:55:57,923
I'm very sorry, Mrs Carr.

765
00:56:08,492 --> 00:56:10,484
That son of a bitch is crazy.

766
00:56:19,892 --> 00:56:21,928
- Hello?
- Yeah, Roger.

767
00:56:22,012 --> 00:56:23,923
It's Michael. I know it's late.

768
00:56:24,012 --> 00:56:27,687
How do I get a psycho cop off my back?

769
00:56:31,052 --> 00:56:32,849
You're the Michael Carr...

770
00:56:32,932 --> 00:56:35,890
...that I okayed to do
a ride-along with Officer Davis?

771
00:56:35,972 --> 00:56:37,963
Yes, sir. That's right.

772
00:56:38,052 --> 00:56:41,567
The same Michael Carr whose wife called
to commend Officer Davis?

773
00:56:41,652 --> 00:56:46,932
The same two people that are now being
terrorised by this out-of-control sicko.

774
00:56:47,012 --> 00:56:48,809
Out-of-control sicko?

775
00:56:48,892 --> 00:56:51,612
Are you sure
there's nothing personal in this?

776
00:56:51,692 --> 00:56:54,253
There's no question that it's personal.

777
00:56:54,332 --> 00:56:57,643
He bust into my bedroom
when I was having sex with my wife.

778
00:56:58,932 --> 00:57:00,730
Yes, well...

779
00:57:00,812 --> 00:57:04,886
Officer Cole's report says
they were responding to an alarm.

780
00:57:04,972 --> 00:57:07,850
That was verified by your security company.

781
00:57:07,932 --> 00:57:11,402
Sure. How about the boot
he had put on my car? My credit cards?

782
00:57:11,492 --> 00:57:14,768
What about them?
Do you have proof he did those things?

783
00:57:14,853 --> 00:57:17,969
You're accusing a highly-decorated officer.

784
00:57:18,053 --> 00:57:20,361
I don't care how many medals he has.

785
00:57:20,452 --> 00:57:23,570
- I want this taken care of.
- Or else what, Mr Carr?

786
00:57:23,652 --> 00:57:26,689
You're not giving me anything. No evidence.

787
00:57:26,773 --> 00:57:30,082
You don't have any witnesses.
You don't even have a home video.

788
00:57:30,172 --> 00:57:33,131
These days, everybody's
got a goddamn home video.

789
00:57:33,212 --> 00:57:35,931
Fine. You're just going to bury this thing.

790
00:57:36,013 --> 00:57:39,562
Mr Carr! This is a
professional organisation.

791
00:57:39,653 --> 00:57:42,610
We're going to do
a professional investigation, OK?

792
00:57:42,693 --> 00:57:45,764
Matt, bring me the
complaint forms, will you?

793
00:57:45,853 --> 00:57:50,801
If there's any truth to your allegations,
we'll take care of it, all right?

794
00:57:51,572 --> 00:57:53,052
Thank you.

795
00:57:53,132 --> 00:57:57,843
The department doesn't want an unstable
officer on the street any more than you do.

796
00:57:57,933 --> 00:58:00,526
- Fill this out. Have you got a pen?
- No, sir.

797
00:58:00,612 --> 00:58:02,603
Thank you.

798
00:58:11,532 --> 00:58:14,491
- Roger, how are you doing?
- He's not coming.

799
00:58:14,572 --> 00:58:18,885
Your friend, Officer Davis, called Lurie
and asked him lots of questions.

800
00:58:18,972 --> 00:58:22,329
How well does he know you?
Has he done business with you before?

801
00:58:22,413 --> 00:58:26,963
Lurie's pulling his people out.
He thinks you're under investigation.

802
00:58:27,053 --> 00:58:29,327
This fucker is ruining me.

803
00:58:29,413 --> 00:58:33,087
We can maybe smooth it over,
if we deal with your friend.

804
00:58:33,173 --> 00:58:36,289
I already filed a complaint, Roger.
You told me to do it.

805
00:58:36,373 --> 00:58:39,284
You know what this is?
Some kind of cop scam.

806
00:58:39,373 --> 00:58:42,763
This putz is just supplementing
his lousy income.

807
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:44,764
Pay him off.

808
00:58:44,852 --> 00:58:49,404
Roger, as my lawyer, you're advising
me to bribe a police officer?

809
00:58:49,493 --> 00:58:53,690
No. I'm advising you to donate to
the son of a bitch's favourite charity.

810
00:59:25,974 --> 00:59:27,964
Thanks for meeting me, Pete.

811
00:59:28,054 --> 00:59:30,044
It gives us

812
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:33,325
a chance to talk a little bit.

813
00:59:33,414 --> 00:59:36,611
You know, I don't remember
how this all began

814
00:59:36,694 --> 00:59:38,685
or what I did.

815
00:59:39,574 --> 00:59:42,964
But... whatever, l...

816
00:59:43,054 --> 00:59:44,203
I'm sorry.

817
00:59:44,294 --> 00:59:46,285
You know, l...

818
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:49,285
I'm not looking to get
you into trouble, Pete.

819
00:59:49,374 --> 00:59:51,683
I certainly don't need any myself.

820
00:59:52,294 --> 00:59:54,285
What do you say?

821
00:59:54,374 --> 00:59:56,365
Water under the bridge?

822
00:59:56,454 --> 00:59:58,843
Hell, we can part friends.

823
01:00:01,614 --> 01:00:04,333
Of course, I'll withdraw the complaint.

824
01:00:12,054 --> 01:00:14,045
OK. Here it is.

825
01:00:15,374 --> 01:00:17,365
- What's this?
- $5,000.

826
01:00:17,454 --> 01:00:21,083
You walk away
and don't mess with my investors.

827
01:00:21,774 --> 01:00:23,765
A bribe, Mikey?

828
01:00:23,854 --> 01:00:26,049
Call it whatever you want, Pete.

829
01:00:26,134 --> 01:00:28,125
- I need this deal.
- Sssh.

830
01:00:30,174 --> 01:00:32,404
Do you hear that?

831
01:00:34,854 --> 01:00:36,845
I used to work these hills.

832
01:00:38,734 --> 01:00:40,725
I knew this lady.

833
01:00:40,814 --> 01:00:43,374
She was out walking her little poodle.

834
01:00:45,054 --> 01:00:49,445
A coyote comes charging out,
snatches up the poodle and takes off.

835
01:00:51,134 --> 01:00:56,162
All we ever found ofthat little doggy
was its diamond-studded leash.

836
01:00:58,054 --> 01:01:01,808
When Karen first met you,
she thought you were different...

837
01:01:01,894 --> 01:01:05,125
- than her gambling father.
- What?

838
01:01:05,214 --> 01:01:07,648
It's interesting how
people follow patterns.

839
01:01:08,374 --> 01:01:11,492
She doesn't feel safe
with you either, Michael.

840
01:01:11,574 --> 01:01:15,931
Karen needs to feel protected
when those coyotes come charging out.

841
01:01:16,014 --> 01:01:18,323
Listen. You stay the fuck away from her...

842
01:01:18,734 --> 01:01:19,723
Ugh!

843
01:01:21,854 --> 01:01:23,845
Assaulting a police officer?

844
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:26,688
A nice, civilised man like you, Michael?

845
01:01:26,774 --> 01:01:29,732
What are you going to do? Arrest me?

846
01:01:29,814 --> 01:01:31,805
Arrest you?

847
01:01:35,694 --> 01:01:38,128
I could kill you.

848
01:02:14,974 --> 01:02:16,965
What's wrong?

849
01:02:19,575 --> 01:02:21,565
What's going on, Karen?

850
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:24,043
What the hell are you talking about?

851
01:02:24,135 --> 01:02:27,444
You and Pete. What's going on?

852
01:02:27,534 --> 01:02:30,287
What are you accusing me of?
We had a cup of coffee!

853
01:02:30,375 --> 01:02:32,764
It must have been a hot cup of coffee!

854
01:02:32,855 --> 01:02:37,975
He gave a talk to the kids. Ifyou think
there was anything else, you're crazy.

855
01:02:38,054 --> 01:02:40,125
I am? He just put a gun to my head.

856
01:02:40,215 --> 01:02:42,409
What?

857
01:02:42,494 --> 01:02:45,692
He just put a fucking gun to my head.
He wants you.

858
01:02:45,774 --> 01:02:47,891
He thinks you want him.

859
01:02:47,974 --> 01:02:50,613
I swear he didn't get
any ofthose ideas from me.

860
01:02:50,695 --> 01:02:53,413
He didn't pull them out ofthe air, Karen.

861
01:02:55,614 --> 01:02:58,732
So, what is it? You get
off on leading him on?

862
01:02:59,374 --> 01:03:01,365
Talking to him about us?

863
01:03:01,974 --> 01:03:03,965
About our marriage? Jesus!

864
01:03:04,975 --> 01:03:06,966
I told you he's dangerous.

865
01:03:07,055 --> 01:03:09,522
What's it gonna take? Me in a body bag?

866
01:03:12,975 --> 01:03:15,249
I'm sorry.

867
01:03:16,975 --> 01:03:18,965
I'm sorry.

868
01:03:46,094 --> 01:03:47,813
Officer Cole.

869
01:03:47,894 --> 01:03:51,251
Your partner.
I went to him, tried to work things out.

870
01:03:51,335 --> 01:03:54,132
Didn't you know enough
to stay away from him?

871
01:03:54,215 --> 01:03:57,366
He's playing you.
Every time you react, it gets worse.

872
01:03:57,454 --> 01:04:00,128
Cops on one side,
everybody else on the other?

873
01:04:00,214 --> 01:04:02,968
Yeah. That's it.

874
01:04:03,055 --> 01:04:05,330
He threatened to kill me last night.

875
01:04:05,415 --> 01:04:07,326
How should I react to that?

876
01:04:09,894 --> 01:04:13,524
If anybody knows this guy is coming apart,
it's got to be you.

877
01:04:13,615 --> 01:04:15,845
Come on, man. The guy's after my wife.

878
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:17,926
I don't know where else to go.

879
01:04:31,334 --> 01:04:33,724
Come on in.

880
01:04:41,854 --> 01:04:45,370
He doesn't understand.
I'm better for her than he is.

881
01:04:45,454 --> 01:04:49,164
He doesn't love her. He can't take
care of her the way that I can.

882
01:04:49,255 --> 01:04:50,654
She needs it.

883
01:04:50,735 --> 01:04:52,965
What the hell are you going on about?

884
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:54,966
She's never gonna be yours.

885
01:04:55,055 --> 01:04:57,694
You listen to me. Nothing...

886
01:04:57,774 --> 01:05:01,210
Nothing is ever going to happen
between you and her.

887
01:05:01,295 --> 01:05:03,763
She is some fantasy in your head.

888
01:05:03,854 --> 01:05:06,289
You don't know what you're talking about.

889
01:05:06,375 --> 01:05:08,206
- I don't, huh?
- You don't.

890
01:05:08,295 --> 01:05:12,174
You tell me what you were doing
with him the other night.

891
01:05:12,255 --> 01:05:15,133
Tell me you didn't stick a gun in his face.

892
01:05:15,215 --> 01:05:17,570
I was just playing with him.

893
01:05:17,655 --> 01:05:19,452
I'm not playing with you!

894
01:05:19,535 --> 01:05:21,844
You've got to back offthis madness.

895
01:05:21,935 --> 01:05:25,052
You've got to put in
for stress leave and see a doctor

896
01:05:25,135 --> 01:05:26,853
and get your head straight.

897
01:05:28,775 --> 01:05:30,094
Or?

898
01:05:30,175 --> 01:05:35,203
Or I will go upstairs and tell them exactly
what is going on with you. Understand?

899
01:05:35,295 --> 01:05:37,206
You'd do that?

900
01:05:37,295 --> 01:05:38,967
You're goddamn right.

901
01:05:39,055 --> 01:05:41,649
And ifyou don't do it in the next 24 hours,

902
01:05:41,735 --> 01:05:43,691
that is exactly what I will do.

903
01:05:44,935 --> 01:05:46,926
Now,

904
01:05:47,015 --> 01:05:49,324
you go have coffee with a shrink.

905
01:05:50,055 --> 01:05:52,125
And it will be all right.

906
01:05:52,975 --> 01:05:54,567
You'll see.

907
01:06:32,055 --> 01:06:34,046
Would you look at that?

908
01:06:36,455 --> 01:06:38,446
Hell with it, man. Leave it.

909
01:06:39,775 --> 01:06:41,766
Leon! Freeze!

910
01:07:20,575 --> 01:07:21,405
Shit!

911
01:07:45,976 --> 01:07:47,375
Leon!

912
01:07:52,015 --> 01:07:52,925
Leon!

913
01:07:53,015 --> 01:07:55,006
Open the door!

914
01:08:01,535 --> 01:08:03,527
Put the box down!

915
01:08:03,615 --> 01:08:05,571
- It's finished.
- Put it down!

916
01:08:05,656 --> 01:08:08,489
What the hell are you making us
chase you for? Huh?

917
01:08:08,576 --> 01:08:11,043
Get over there. You know the routine.

918
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:12,694
Spread 'em!

919
01:08:12,775 --> 01:08:14,811
You could be busting real crime.

920
01:08:14,896 --> 01:08:16,693
Yeah, I've got a benny bust.

921
01:08:16,775 --> 01:08:18,766
What have we got here?

922
01:08:18,896 --> 01:08:21,205
I'm providing a service

923
01:08:21,296 --> 01:08:24,890
for those cabbies
who fall asleep behind the wheel.

924
01:08:24,976 --> 01:08:27,046
Hey! That's enough.

925
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:37,090
I need something more than this.
Come on, Leon!

926
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:43,773
Look what we got here.
You really are Mr Clean!

927
01:08:43,856 --> 01:08:46,370
Keep this. You might need it later on!

928
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:48,969
Don't you believe in safe sex?

929
01:08:49,056 --> 01:08:51,774
He's got a gun! He's gonna shoot me!

930
01:09:00,536 --> 01:09:01,968
Shit...

931
01:09:02,056 --> 01:09:03,967
What are you doing?

932
01:09:06,416 --> 01:09:08,407
- What? Come on!
- Take the gun.

933
01:09:08,495 --> 01:09:10,930
No, I don't want the gun.
I don't want the gun!

934
01:09:11,015 --> 01:09:13,086
- Take the gun.
- I don't want it!

935
01:09:13,176 --> 01:09:15,167
Take the gun. Go.

936
01:09:24,415 --> 01:09:26,805
You killed my partner, Leon.

937
01:09:49,096 --> 01:09:52,054
You're not going upstairs
to talk to anyone.

938
01:10:34,176 --> 01:10:36,167
I went around the back.

939
01:10:39,496 --> 01:10:41,487
Roy...

940
01:10:41,576 --> 01:10:43,885
...followed the suspect in, I guess.

941
01:10:47,176 --> 01:10:49,167
Then I heard shots.

942
01:10:52,776 --> 01:10:54,767
That scumbag shot Roy.

943
01:10:58,376 --> 01:11:00,367
And I guess Roy...

944
01:11:01,216 --> 01:11:04,174
...nailed him before he died.

945
01:11:42,976 --> 01:11:44,967
Wiseman, Acken and Shyer.

946
01:11:45,056 --> 01:11:47,695
This is Michael Carr.
I need to talk with Roger.

947
01:11:47,776 --> 01:11:50,370
He's out ofhis offiice.
Can I take a message?

948
01:11:50,456 --> 01:11:53,448
Page him. Tell him I'm at home.
I'm being set up.

949
01:11:53,536 --> 01:11:55,925
There's cops all over my yard.

950
01:11:56,376 --> 01:11:57,604
Michael!

951
01:11:57,696 --> 01:11:59,607
Tell him to call me immediately.

952
01:11:59,696 --> 01:12:03,450
We have a warrant to search
your dwelling for narcotics.

953
01:12:03,856 --> 01:12:05,847
Please, sir. Step over here.

954
01:12:05,936 --> 01:12:08,211
An informant has given us your address

955
01:12:08,296 --> 01:12:11,766
as a residence where he purchased
narcotics from a Michael Carr.

956
01:12:11,856 --> 01:12:14,530
- This is crazy!
- Are you Michael Carr?

957
01:12:14,616 --> 01:12:16,608
Yeah.

958
01:12:42,097 --> 01:12:44,008
Surprise, surprise.

959
01:12:44,096 --> 01:12:48,726
Michael Carr, I'm placing you under arrest
for possession of narcotics.

960
01:12:48,816 --> 01:12:52,571
You have the right to remain silent
and to contact an attorney.

961
01:12:52,656 --> 01:12:54,374
If you cannot afford one...

962
01:12:54,456 --> 01:12:57,335
I'm removing your glasses
for your safety, sir.

963
01:12:57,416 --> 01:12:59,805
We'll take you down to the station now.

964
01:12:59,896 --> 01:13:03,172
We can pull a car up to the back
so your neighbours won't see.

965
01:13:03,257 --> 01:13:05,326
That's very thoughtful ofyou.

966
01:13:05,416 --> 01:13:09,011
Call Roger. Make sure
you get hold of Roger.

967
01:13:33,057 --> 01:13:35,251
I'm Detective Noble. How do you do?

968
01:13:35,336 --> 01:13:39,091
I want to offer you the opportunity
to make it easy on yourself.

969
01:13:39,176 --> 01:13:42,964
If you name your connection,
you can be out of here as soon as possible.

970
01:13:43,056 --> 01:13:46,731
I'm not talking to anybody
until I speak with my lawyer.

971
01:13:47,577 --> 01:13:49,568
That's your right, Mr Carr.

972
01:14:39,376 --> 01:14:41,367
You've got ten minutes.

973
01:14:54,777 --> 01:14:56,768
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

974
01:14:56,857 --> 01:14:58,688
How's Karen?

975
01:14:58,777 --> 01:15:00,653
Hanging in there.

976
01:15:00,737 --> 01:15:02,614
Do I get to see her?

977
01:15:02,697 --> 01:15:06,689
After the arraignment.
You're only allowed legal counsel now.

978
01:15:06,777 --> 01:15:08,368
What about bail?

979
01:15:08,457 --> 01:15:10,607
That will be set at your hearing.

980
01:15:11,176 --> 01:15:13,407
What's your money situation?

981
01:15:13,497 --> 01:15:17,775
Everything I had went into the party
to impress Lurie.

982
01:15:17,857 --> 01:15:19,848
I need to know exactly.

983
01:15:23,817 --> 01:15:25,808
$2,200.

984
01:15:26,577 --> 01:15:32,209
I don't think they'll set bail too high. It's
not like you're a professional dope dealer.

985
01:15:33,537 --> 01:15:35,209
Professional?

986
01:15:36,417 --> 01:15:40,376
There was half a pound of cocaine
in your house. We've got a problem.

987
01:15:40,457 --> 01:15:41,731
My problem's simple.

988
01:15:41,817 --> 01:15:44,490
A cop wants me out ofthe way
because he wants my wife.

989
01:15:48,217 --> 01:15:50,208
Look. This is way over my head.

990
01:15:51,177 --> 01:15:55,614
I got in touch with Sam Gershon.
He's the best criminal attorney I know.

991
01:15:55,697 --> 01:15:57,972
He'll represent you at your hearing.

992
01:15:58,057 --> 01:16:02,687
You guys need to talk to Roy Cole.
Davis' partner, Officer Roy Cole.

993
01:16:02,777 --> 01:16:07,407
He told me that if anything else happened,
he'd help me out.

994
01:16:08,417 --> 01:16:10,408
Cole's dead.

995
01:16:12,617 --> 01:16:16,371
In the line of duty, in a shoot-out.
I talked to his captain.

996
01:16:22,297 --> 01:16:24,333
He won't stop until he kills me.

997
01:16:24,417 --> 01:16:26,408
Get me out of here, Roger.

998
01:16:26,497 --> 01:16:29,057
I will. It's all in hand.

999
01:16:29,137 --> 01:16:31,571
No, no, no. You listen to me.

1000
01:16:32,977 --> 01:16:35,366
Just get me out of here.

1001
01:16:35,457 --> 01:16:39,370
Case PA846059. People versus Alvarez.

1002
01:16:39,457 --> 01:16:43,973
Mr Alvarez is charged with
illegal possession of an automatic weapon

1003
01:16:44,057 --> 01:16:46,890
as set forth in the California Penal Code.

1004
01:16:46,977 --> 01:16:49,094
Is he represented by counsel?

1005
01:16:49,177 --> 01:16:50,769
He pleads innocent.

1006
01:16:50,857 --> 01:16:54,736
Nothing can be served
by his detention until trial.

1007
01:16:54,817 --> 01:17:00,255
- We request release on OR.
- Denied. Bail set at $25,000.

1008
01:17:00,338 --> 01:17:03,852
Case PA855327.

1009
01:17:03,938 --> 01:17:05,734
People versus Michael Carr.

1010
01:17:05,817 --> 01:17:10,369
Mr Carr is charged with possession
of cocaine with intent to distribute

1011
01:17:10,457 --> 01:17:15,975
as set forth in section 11351 and 11352
of the California Health and Safety Code.

1012
01:17:16,897 --> 01:17:20,173
- Is he represented by counsel?
- He pleads innocent.

1013
01:17:20,258 --> 01:17:23,932
Your Honour, he is a model citizen
who owns his own home.

1014
01:17:24,017 --> 01:17:26,009
He's in business locally.

1015
01:17:26,097 --> 01:17:30,057
His wife is a teacher
in a respected local private school.

1016
01:17:30,137 --> 01:17:32,208
We request bail on OR.

1017
01:17:32,737 --> 01:17:38,369
Your Honour, it's come to our attention that
Mr Carr pled out a similar case in Texas.

1018
01:17:46,177 --> 01:17:48,168
What about this?

1019
01:17:48,257 --> 01:17:50,248
It wasn't me.

1020
01:17:50,337 --> 01:17:52,568
I took an investor out on the town.

1021
01:17:52,657 --> 01:17:56,411
The guy had a vial of blow in his pocket
and stuck it under the car seat.

1022
01:17:56,498 --> 01:18:00,332
A lawyer told me the easiest thing
to do was plead it out, so...

1023
01:18:00,417 --> 01:18:02,807
- But it wasn't me.
- It doesn't matter.

1024
01:18:02,897 --> 01:18:05,365
You took the deal, it's on the record.

1025
01:18:07,018 --> 01:18:11,808
This OR is denied. Bail is set at $250,000.

1026
01:18:11,897 --> 01:18:17,052
Case PA861288. People versus Jenkins.

1027
01:18:17,137 --> 01:18:19,527
Mr Jenkins is charged with felony

1028
01:18:19,618 --> 01:18:22,894
as set forth in section 4873
of the California Penal Code.

1029
01:18:22,977 --> 01:18:26,526
Mr Jenkins pleads not
guilty, Your Honour...

1030
01:18:41,377 --> 01:18:43,653
Having trouble making bail, Mike?

1031
01:18:43,737 --> 01:18:45,728
Money's a little tight, huh?

1032
01:18:47,857 --> 01:18:49,849
Karen's really upset.

1033
01:18:49,937 --> 01:18:53,613
You really shouldn't have done this to her.

1034
01:18:55,377 --> 01:18:57,368
She's all alone now.

1035
01:18:58,537 --> 01:19:00,528
But don't worry, not for long.

1036
01:19:06,577 --> 01:19:09,775
I want you to know
that she's gonna be taken care of.

1037
01:19:09,857 --> 01:19:11,849
I know what Karen needs.

1038
01:19:13,138 --> 01:19:16,049
And isn't it her happiness
that we both want?

1039
01:19:16,137 --> 01:19:18,128
Hmm?

1040
01:19:21,618 --> 01:19:24,370
If you could find us,
why don't you look us up?

1041
01:19:24,458 --> 01:19:27,097
I'd love to have you over for a barbecue.

1042
01:19:27,177 --> 01:19:29,168
If you go near her,

1043
01:19:31,218 --> 01:19:33,174
I'll kill you.

1044
01:19:37,778 --> 01:19:39,769
So long, Mikey.

1045
01:19:44,897 --> 01:19:46,888
You look good in blue!

1046
01:20:01,378 --> 01:20:04,050
- Hey.
- Hi.

1047
01:20:04,138 --> 01:20:05,810
How are you doing?

1048
01:20:05,897 --> 01:20:08,128
I'm fine. I'm just a little tired.

1049
01:20:08,817 --> 01:20:10,297
There you are!

1050
01:20:10,378 --> 01:20:12,368
I thought he might be hungry.

1051
01:20:12,458 --> 01:20:14,494
- Thanks.
- How about you?

1052
01:20:14,578 --> 01:20:16,932
I could use something, yeah.

1053
01:20:17,018 --> 01:20:19,008
Good.

1054
01:20:19,098 --> 01:20:20,974
Penny...

1055
01:20:21,058 --> 01:20:23,049
I'm really glad you're here.

1056
01:20:23,138 --> 01:20:26,255
It's no problem.
I'll stay till Michael gets home.

1057
01:20:26,338 --> 01:20:28,056
It's gonna be a while.

1058
01:20:28,138 --> 01:20:31,608
That's OK. Get some rest.

1059
01:20:32,617 --> 01:20:34,609
Guard!

1060
01:20:34,697 --> 01:20:36,689
Make a telephone call!

1061
01:20:38,778 --> 01:20:40,769
Guard!

1062
01:20:41,378 --> 01:20:44,449
Guard! Thanks, man.
Can I make a telephone call?

1063
01:20:44,538 --> 01:20:47,211
Guard! Make a telephone call?

1064
01:20:47,298 --> 01:20:48,048
Shut up!

1065
01:20:51,618 --> 01:20:54,496
You're just a fat little piggy, aren't you?

1066
01:21:03,298 --> 01:21:05,289
There you go.

1067
01:21:07,258 --> 01:21:09,453
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

1068
01:21:09,538 --> 01:21:10,812
Pete?

1069
01:21:10,898 --> 01:21:13,492
Karen's upstairs. She's got a headache.

1070
01:21:13,578 --> 01:21:15,569
Oh.

1071
01:21:15,658 --> 01:21:17,774
I've brought some groceries

1072
01:21:17,858 --> 01:21:21,771
in case she didn't have time
after everything that's been going on.

1073
01:21:21,858 --> 01:21:23,496
I'll tell her you came by.

1074
01:21:24,578 --> 01:21:26,728
Why don't I just give them to you?

1075
01:21:26,818 --> 01:21:28,888
I gotta get going to work, so...

1076
01:21:34,898 --> 01:21:37,810
I'm not very popular here, am I, Penny?

1077
01:21:39,378 --> 01:21:40,811
All right.

1078
01:21:40,898 --> 01:21:43,128
I'll just leave them here.

1079
01:21:43,218 --> 01:21:45,254
You can get them...

1080
01:21:45,338 --> 01:21:47,329
You can get them later.

1081
01:21:47,978 --> 01:21:49,775
Take care.

1082
01:21:49,858 --> 01:21:52,167
You look great. I'll see you later.

1083
01:21:52,978 --> 01:21:54,969
Bye.

1084
01:22:53,058 --> 01:22:55,050
250. That's a hard bullet.

1085
01:22:55,138 --> 01:22:57,208
You're looking at $25K, Mr Graham.

1086
01:22:57,298 --> 01:22:59,289
Here's the deed to my house.

1087
01:23:00,938 --> 01:23:04,374
This takes care ofthe bail,
but what about my premium?

1088
01:23:04,458 --> 01:23:07,052
I'm writing you a $25,000 personal cheque.

1089
01:23:07,139 --> 01:23:08,936
That's a nice Rolex.

1090
01:23:09,018 --> 01:23:12,294
Forget the watch. Sam Gershon
said you'd take care of me.

1091
01:23:12,379 --> 01:23:15,654
This should be a cashier's cheque,
but you're a friend of Sam.

1092
01:23:15,739 --> 01:23:18,047
If the bank says you've got funds, OK.

1093
01:23:20,378 --> 01:23:23,017
Touch-tone phones, you don't have that?

1094
01:23:54,698 --> 01:23:58,088
All right. Can I make that phone call now?
Please?

1095
01:23:58,179 --> 01:24:01,728
It would just take a second.
I'd really appreciate it.

1096
01:24:01,819 --> 01:24:03,810
Talk to you when I can.

1097
01:24:13,859 --> 01:24:16,248
- Operator.
- A collect, from Michael.

1098
01:24:16,339 --> 01:24:17,851
One moment.

1099
01:24:33,938 --> 01:24:37,487
I'm sorry, sir.
The phone mustbe offthe hook.

1100
01:24:37,579 --> 01:24:40,854
Can you cut in or something?
This is an emergency.

1101
01:24:40,939 --> 01:24:42,088
I did that, sir.

1102
01:24:42,179 --> 01:24:45,057
Can you help me?
I won't get to a phone again.

1103
01:24:45,138 --> 01:24:49,052
It's a machine, I can't tellit what to do.
I can reportit...

1104
01:24:49,139 --> 01:24:52,211
- Are you sure it's offthe hook?
- Yes, sir, itis.

1105
01:25:04,378 --> 01:25:06,688
Penny, it smells so good!

1106
01:25:06,779 --> 01:25:08,929
I didn't know cooking was one ofyour...

1107
01:25:09,459 --> 01:25:11,051
Hi.

1108
01:25:11,139 --> 01:25:13,699
Are you feeling better?

1109
01:25:14,979 --> 01:25:16,970
I got some erm...

1110
01:25:17,059 --> 01:25:20,051
...mushrooms, onions, dried tomatoes,

1111
01:25:20,858 --> 01:25:22,849
parsley.

1112
01:25:22,938 --> 01:25:25,931
- Where's Penny?
- Penny?

1113
01:25:26,019 --> 01:25:28,010
Erm...

1114
01:25:28,099 --> 01:25:30,090
I told her to go home.

1115
01:25:31,859 --> 01:25:33,850
She'd just be a third wheel.

1116
01:25:48,979 --> 01:25:52,210
I took the phone offthe hook
so you could sleep

1117
01:25:52,299 --> 01:25:54,210
and have no distractions.

1118
01:25:54,299 --> 01:25:56,290
I'm not sleeping now, am I?

1119
01:25:56,379 --> 01:25:58,370
I want you to leave.

1120
01:25:58,459 --> 01:26:00,211
Wait.

1121
01:26:00,299 --> 01:26:02,289
I know I shouldn't be here.

1122
01:26:02,379 --> 01:26:04,529
I know you're upset.

1123
01:26:04,619 --> 01:26:06,928
But let's stop kidding ourselves, Karen.

1124
01:26:07,019 --> 01:26:10,136
We've bent over backwards
to do the right thing.

1125
01:26:10,219 --> 01:26:13,291
You playing the perfect wife,
me the good friend.

1126
01:26:13,379 --> 01:26:16,337
I can't take it any more, I just can't.

1127
01:26:17,339 --> 01:26:19,375
Now we can stop pretending.

1128
01:26:20,299 --> 01:26:22,290
We can stop pretending now.

1129
01:26:22,379 --> 01:26:24,449
Pete, I'm very tired.

1130
01:26:24,539 --> 01:26:28,134
I... I need some time alone.
I've got to be by myself.

1131
01:26:28,219 --> 01:26:30,210
I know, I know. I understand.

1132
01:26:33,299 --> 01:26:35,051
Come here. Sit down.

1133
01:26:36,339 --> 01:26:38,330
Sit down.

1134
01:26:38,419 --> 01:26:40,410
I know what's scaring you.

1135
01:26:41,579 --> 01:26:43,171
Listen.

1136
01:26:43,259 --> 01:26:45,329
I don't have to be a cop any more.

1137
01:26:47,539 --> 01:26:50,576
OK? L could do something different
with my life.

1138
01:26:51,459 --> 01:26:53,450
Something clean.

1139
01:26:54,659 --> 01:26:56,968
I think that's good.

1140
01:26:57,059 --> 01:27:00,893
No-one should have to live their life
the way you have been.

1141
01:27:00,979 --> 01:27:04,289
You wouldn't have to carry a gun any more.

1142
01:27:06,979 --> 01:27:08,971
Why don't you put it away? Hmm?

1143
01:27:18,219 --> 01:27:20,414
No gun. No badge.

1144
01:27:28,979 --> 01:27:31,369
I'd better go cook.

1145
01:27:35,019 --> 01:27:37,010
- Pete...
- What?

1146
01:27:37,099 --> 01:27:39,090
I forgot about Tiny.

1147
01:27:41,019 --> 01:27:43,011
The cat!

1148
01:27:43,099 --> 01:27:45,897
I don't like leaving him outside at night.

1149
01:27:49,539 --> 01:27:51,291
OK.

1150
01:27:51,380 --> 01:27:53,097
I'll be right back.

1151
01:28:32,180 --> 01:28:33,977
Karen!

1152
01:28:46,219 --> 01:28:47,857
You got him.

1153
01:28:49,340 --> 01:28:51,331
Yeah.

1154
01:28:55,140 --> 01:28:57,131
Hey, Tiny.

1155
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:03,890
- Are you OK?
- Mm-hm.

1156
01:29:05,179 --> 01:29:06,771
Yeah.

1157
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:12,371
Are you sure?

1158
01:29:12,460 --> 01:29:14,451
Mm-hm.

1159
01:29:14,819 --> 01:29:17,539
- You're really tense.
- I am a little bit.

1160
01:29:19,979 --> 01:29:22,050
Come here. I know what you need.

1161
01:29:22,140 --> 01:29:24,131
Come here. It's OK, come on.

1162
01:29:41,699 --> 01:29:44,168
- Move over.
- Move over?

1163
01:29:44,260 --> 01:29:45,852
Come on, let's go.

1164
01:29:45,940 --> 01:29:47,658
Go ahead, take my car!

1165
01:29:47,740 --> 01:29:49,856
I already put up my house to get you out.

1166
01:29:49,940 --> 01:29:51,339
Put on your seat belt.

1167
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:07,658
You keep all your tension
in your shoulders.

1168
01:30:09,980 --> 01:30:11,971
All up here.

1169
01:30:12,060 --> 01:30:14,051
Just relax.

1170
01:30:16,460 --> 01:30:18,451
Just relax.

1171
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:21,890
Breathe.

1172
01:30:33,340 --> 01:30:35,900
I feel so lucky being alone here with you.

1173
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:43,137
Tell me how much you love me.

1174
01:30:43,220 --> 01:30:46,337
It will never be as much as I love you.

1175
01:30:49,100 --> 01:30:51,091
Pete, don't.

1176
01:30:51,979 --> 01:30:53,970
Don't what?

1177
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:56,531
Don't what?

1178
01:30:56,620 --> 01:30:58,929
I don't feel very pretty right now.

1179
01:30:59,380 --> 01:31:02,213
Karen, you're beautiful.

1180
01:31:03,220 --> 01:31:04,335
No.

1181
01:31:07,220 --> 01:31:09,211
I want to look better.

1182
01:31:11,540 --> 01:31:14,213
I want to put on something nice for you,

1183
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:16,370
something that you'll like.

1184
01:31:24,820 --> 01:31:26,811
I'll call you when I'm ready.

1185
01:31:28,940 --> 01:31:30,931
Don't be long.

1186
01:31:32,499 --> 01:31:33,615
Slow down!

1187
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:35,816
We won't make it.

1188
01:31:35,900 --> 01:31:38,209
You can't make it! Michael, no!

1189
01:31:39,260 --> 01:31:40,579
Jesus!

1190
01:31:59,780 --> 01:32:01,452
Karen.

1191
01:32:01,540 --> 01:32:03,974
Are you looking for this?

1192
01:32:06,700 --> 01:32:08,691
Yeah, you read my mind.

1193
01:32:08,780 --> 01:32:11,340
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1194
01:32:11,420 --> 01:32:14,696
I hate the damn thing.
I wanted you to get rid of it.

1195
01:32:17,741 --> 01:32:20,095
I thought you were gonna get changed.

1196
01:32:43,020 --> 01:32:44,169
Fuck!

1197
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:48,172
Hang on.

1198
01:33:00,020 --> 01:33:02,011
Don't shoot, I'm a lawyer.

1199
01:35:05,981 --> 01:35:07,573
Get out!

1200
01:35:07,661 --> 01:35:09,253
What are you doing?

1201
01:35:09,340 --> 01:35:12,617
You're a sick fucking brutal asshole!
Get out!

1202
01:35:13,660 --> 01:35:15,651
You're not gonna to shoot me.

1203
01:35:15,740 --> 01:35:19,256
- I swear I'll kill you.
- You're not gonna kill anyone.

1204
01:35:19,341 --> 01:35:21,536
You know that this is right.

1205
01:35:21,621 --> 01:35:23,292
Get away!

1206
01:35:23,381 --> 01:35:25,098
Now, put the gun down.

1207
01:35:25,181 --> 01:35:27,899
Put the gun down.

1208
01:35:32,580 --> 01:35:34,970
Try it again. Shoot again.

1209
01:35:35,821 --> 01:35:38,654
Do you think I'd give you
a loaded fucking gun! Huh?

1210
01:35:41,020 --> 01:35:43,137
See how things are now, huh?

1211
01:35:43,221 --> 01:35:46,133
You little fucking cock-teaser!
Is that what it is?

1212
01:35:46,221 --> 01:35:47,859
You little cock-teaser!

1213
01:35:47,940 --> 01:35:51,138
You try to fucking shoot me!
You wanna shoot me?

1214
01:35:51,221 --> 01:35:53,212
You know what you are, Karen?

1215
01:35:53,301 --> 01:35:55,292
You're a little fucking whore!

1216
01:35:55,381 --> 01:35:59,579
You're a worthless whore, just like
every fucking whore I've ever met.

1217
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:04,490
That's exactly what I'm
going to treat you like.

1218
01:36:05,061 --> 01:36:07,052
Get them fucking open!

1219
01:36:07,141 --> 01:36:10,770
I'm gonna treat you like a whore, Karen!

1220
01:36:49,381 --> 01:36:50,814
Shit!

1221
01:36:54,781 --> 01:36:56,533
No!

1222
01:36:58,221 --> 01:36:59,859
Michael!

1223
01:36:59,941 --> 01:37:01,932
He found your gun.

1224
01:37:05,821 --> 01:37:08,130
I gotta get you out ofthis house!

1225
01:37:39,421 --> 01:37:41,059
Aaagh!

1226
01:38:04,861 --> 01:38:07,011
- Karen!
- No!

1227
01:38:50,982 --> 01:38:52,380
Hello.

1228
01:38:54,142 --> 01:38:56,132
Yeah, this is Michael Carr.

1229
01:38:56,222 --> 01:38:57,939
Thank you for calling.

1230
01:38:58,022 --> 01:39:01,377
I was swinging a golf club
and it went though the...

1231
01:39:01,461 --> 01:39:03,975
It went through the patio window.

1232
01:39:04,061 --> 01:39:07,259
It's OK. There's glass
everywhere, but it's OK.

1233
01:39:08,262 --> 01:39:10,298
Yeah, the password's pyramid.

1234
01:39:14,782 --> 01:39:16,374
No.

1235
01:39:16,461 --> 01:39:18,692
No, I did not change the password.

1236
01:39:18,782 --> 01:39:21,011
I did.

1237
01:39:24,342 --> 01:39:26,333
What's the password?

1238
01:39:26,422 --> 01:39:28,413
Figure it out, asshole.

1239
01:39:29,022 --> 01:39:31,013
Seven letters.

1240
01:39:31,102 --> 01:39:32,978
Fuck you!

1241
01:39:36,141 --> 01:39:38,815
This is going to cost you, Michael.

1242
01:39:42,142 --> 01:39:44,132
Come on, get up here.

1243
01:39:46,381 --> 01:39:48,372
Karen!

1244
01:39:49,301 --> 01:39:51,098
Karen! This is the way it is.

1245
01:39:51,182 --> 01:39:54,332
We've got two minutes
to get in my car and get out of here.

1246
01:39:54,421 --> 01:39:57,937
Do you hear?
If you don't open the door, Michael dies.

1247
01:39:58,021 --> 01:40:00,854
- Understand?
- He'll kill you, too. Stay there.

1248
01:40:00,942 --> 01:40:03,216
- Just shut up.
- Don't come out!

1249
01:40:03,302 --> 01:40:07,295
- Karen, don't fuck around.
- He'll shoot me anyway.

1250
01:40:07,382 --> 01:40:11,659
I won't kill him. Open the door
and I'll let Michael live, I swear.

1251
01:40:11,742 --> 01:40:14,051
If you don't, your husband's dead.

1252
01:40:14,142 --> 01:40:16,211
OK, Karen? That's the way it is.

1253
01:40:16,302 --> 01:40:18,099
I'm giving you a count ofthree.

1254
01:40:18,181 --> 01:40:19,854
One,

1255
01:40:19,942 --> 01:40:21,933
two...

1256
01:40:22,022 --> 01:40:24,172
Pull the trigger, you son of a bitch!

1257
01:40:28,701 --> 01:40:29,691
Karen!

1258
01:40:29,782 --> 01:40:32,216
Karen, don't open the fucking door!

1259
01:42:15,862 --> 01:42:17,215
Michael!

1260
01:42:17,302 --> 01:42:19,293
What are you going to do, tough guy?

1261
01:42:19,382 --> 01:42:22,419
Are you going to make a citizen's arrest?

1262
01:42:22,502 --> 01:42:26,493
Arrest you? Aaagh!
