1
00:03:07,452 --> 00:03:10,091
You once said, about your childhood,

2
00:03:10,172 --> 00:03:12,322
"I grew up with seriousness

3
00:03:12,412 --> 00:03:14,403
all around me."

4
00:03:14,492 --> 00:03:17,245
Yeah, my parents were very, very strict.

5
00:03:17,332 --> 00:03:19,402
I come from a Catholic family.

6
00:03:19,492 --> 00:03:21,767
There are five kids in our family.

7
00:03:21,852 --> 00:03:25,208
We weren’t poor,
but we were lower middle class.

8
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:27,362
We didn’t have a lot of money.

9
00:03:27,452 --> 00:03:29,602
My dad's theory was keep working,

10
00:03:29,692 --> 00:03:31,683
work hard, work hard.

11
00:03:31,772 --> 00:03:33,763
And ah, pretty much no play.

12
00:03:33,852 --> 00:03:37,242
It was almost like not good in our family

13
00:03:37,332 --> 00:03:40,847
If you laughed
or if you wanted to have a lot of fun.

14
00:03:40,932 --> 00:03:43,321
So, that stays with you a little bit

15
00:03:44,972 --> 00:03:48,647
I think it helped my tennis,
because I did work hard.

16
00:03:50,052 --> 00:03:54,170
But I think it's important
to have a balance in life...

17
00:04:00,132 --> 00:04:04,284
He thinks I put up $100,000 of my money
just to watch it disappear?

18
00:04:04,372 --> 00:04:08,684
- He doesn't care about your money!
- He doesn't have to. I just want to know!

19
00:04:08,772 --> 00:04:11,764
To the people he represents,
it's pocket change.

20
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:14,605
Does he know
what this will do to me and Karen?

21
00:04:14,692 --> 00:04:17,968
- I know you're out there
- Yeah, but does he know?

22
00:04:18,052 --> 00:04:19,770
Michael...

23
00:04:19,852 --> 00:04:24,801
Listen, Roger, it sounds good.
Fax it to me, I'll talk to you in the morning.

24
00:04:24,892 --> 00:04:27,360
Sorry, I tried to keep it quiet.

25
00:04:27,452 --> 00:04:30,808
I heard a noise from downstairs.
Didn't you hear it?

26
00:04:30,892 --> 00:04:33,531
No, I was cracking on the phone with Roger.

27
00:04:33,612 --> 00:04:37,844
It's probably the wind... or fuzz-face here.
Why does he hate me?

28
00:04:37,932 --> 00:04:40,924
If you paid him more attention,
he'd like you better.

29
00:04:41,012 --> 00:04:43,731
He would if I fed him goodies, like you do.

30
00:04:43,812 --> 00:04:45,768
I think you're jealous of Tiny.

31
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:48,320
He gets to sleep with you more than I do.

32
00:04:50,852 --> 00:04:53,685
Is that...? I'll go down.

33
00:04:53,772 --> 00:04:55,922
Maybe we should call the police.

34
00:04:56,052 --> 00:04:58,327
No, it's OK. I'll just check it out.

35
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:09,131
Don't worry. If it's anything serious,
I'll come back for my driver.

36
00:07:22,052 --> 00:07:23,963
Michael, is everything all right?

37
00:07:24,052 --> 00:07:27,283
- Somebody's in the house. Call the police.
- What?

38
00:07:27,372 --> 00:07:29,363
Michael!

39
00:07:36,572 --> 00:07:38,563
No!

40
00:07:42,172 --> 00:07:44,242
Stop, motherfucker! Back off!

41
00:07:45,452 --> 00:07:46,646
Back off!

42
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,723
- Back off!
- OK.

43
00:07:49,532 --> 00:07:52,171
Drop it. Drop it! Drop it!

44
00:07:53,252 --> 00:07:54,844
Take anything you want!

45
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:57,526
- Here, you can have my watch!
- I don't want no watch!

46
00:07:57,612 --> 00:07:59,603
Please don't hurt her.

47
00:07:59,772 --> 00:08:02,491
I'll give you anything you want, please.

48
00:08:35,252 --> 00:08:36,446
Karen!

49
00:08:57,932 --> 00:09:00,571
..outside of 6th at 718.

50
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:13,490
Police, sir.

51
00:09:17,052 --> 00:09:18,849
Hi, come on in, guys.

52
00:09:18,932 --> 00:09:21,605
I'm Officer Cole. My partner, Officer Davis.

53
00:09:21,692 --> 00:09:22,647
Michael Carr.

54
00:09:22,732 --> 00:09:25,007
What happened to your foot, Mr. Carr?

55
00:09:25,092 --> 00:09:27,526
I knocked a beer bottle down in the kitchen.

56
00:09:27,612 --> 00:09:29,603
It's nothing really.

57
00:09:29,692 --> 00:09:32,160
Mr.  Carr, can you tell us what happened?

58
00:09:32,252 --> 00:09:35,801
Yeah. We were upstairs in my office,
my wife and I,

59
00:09:35,892 --> 00:09:37,883
and we heard a noise.

60
00:09:37,972 --> 00:09:40,691
This is my wife, Karen.

61
00:09:40,772 --> 00:09:42,569
Thank you for coming so quickly.

62
00:09:42,652 --> 00:09:46,201
Can you tell us what happened
after you heard the noise?

63
00:09:46,292 --> 00:09:48,283
Michael went down and I,

64
00:09:48,372 --> 00:09:50,363
I heard another noise

65
00:09:50,452 --> 00:09:52,443
and I went down... and...

66
00:09:55,332 --> 00:09:57,892
It's OK, Mrs.  Carr. Just take your time.

67
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,361
This man jumped out of the closet

68
00:10:00,452 --> 00:10:02,647
and he and Michael fought.

69
00:10:02,732 --> 00:10:04,962
It wasn't much of a fight, really.

70
00:10:05,052 --> 00:10:07,930
I grabbed his leg, he was trying to get away.

71
00:10:08,012 --> 00:10:10,526
He got out in the kitchen, got hold of Karen

72
00:10:10,612 --> 00:10:12,762
and took off out through the back.

73
00:10:12,852 --> 00:10:15,082
The son of a bitch put a knife to her throat.

74
00:10:15,172 --> 00:10:17,242
- Are you OK?
- Yes, I am.

75
00:10:17,332 --> 00:10:18,845
- Do you need a doctor?
- No.

76
00:10:18,932 --> 00:10:20,445
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, thank you.

77
00:10:21,812 --> 00:10:23,006
Tiny!

78
00:10:23,532 --> 00:10:24,851
Tiny?

79
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,650
Come here, Tiny.

80
00:10:27,732 --> 00:10:30,769
You're not a very good watchcat,
are you, Tiny?

81
00:10:30,852 --> 00:10:31,841
Useless.

82
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:35,447
I guess he likes policemen.

83
00:10:39,492 --> 00:10:43,007
We'll have someone over in the morning
to dust for prints.

84
00:10:43,092 --> 00:10:45,083
Try and not disturb too much.

85
00:10:45,172 --> 00:10:49,131
We've had a bunch of break-ins here.
We think it's the same guy.

86
00:10:49,212 --> 00:10:52,522
- In this street?
- This general area, but we'll get him.

87
00:10:52,612 --> 00:10:56,287
- I wouldn't mind seeing that.
- Does anyone want any coffee?

88
00:10:56,372 --> 00:10:58,363
Yes. I never turn down coffee.

89
00:10:58,452 --> 00:11:00,488
Whoa, watch the glass.

90
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:02,449
Oh.

91
00:11:02,532 --> 00:11:04,011
Excuse me.

92
00:11:04,092 --> 00:11:05,241
Thanks.

93
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:09,120
This guy who's doing this,
is there any chance he'll come back?

94
00:11:09,212 --> 00:11:12,010
We were told this 
was a safe neighborhood.

95
00:11:12,092 --> 00:11:15,482
All things considered,
this is a safe neighborhood.

96
00:11:15,572 --> 00:11:18,928
Mr. Carr probably scared him so much,
he won't come back.

97
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,287
It doesn't matter. I'm getting a gun.

98
00:11:21,372 --> 00:11:22,964
- What?
- I'm getting a gun.

99
00:11:23,052 --> 00:11:25,282
- No guns.
- Maybe she'll listen to you guys.

100
00:11:25,372 --> 00:11:27,488
Don't get a gun.

101
00:11:27,572 --> 00:11:29,722
It's easy for you to say, you've got one.

102
00:11:29,812 --> 00:11:32,246
- I'm trained to use it.
- I've done some shooting.

103
00:11:32,332 --> 00:11:34,721
At targets... Not people.

104
00:11:34,812 --> 00:11:37,610
Take our advice. 
Get an alarm, get a dog,

105
00:11:37,692 --> 00:11:39,364
but forget about guns.

106
00:11:39,452 --> 00:11:41,488
The wrong people always get hurt.

107
00:11:46,252 --> 00:11:48,243
Nice people.

108
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,562
Hey. I know what you're thinking.

109
00:11:51,572 --> 00:11:53,608
What am I thinking, Roy?

110
00:12:02,852 --> 00:12:05,412
I'm never gonna be able to sleep.

111
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:07,528
Me neither.

112
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:13,965
I thought he...

113
00:12:16,052 --> 00:12:18,043
When he grabbed me...

114
00:12:22,052 --> 00:12:24,043
It's all right.

115
00:12:24,132 --> 00:12:27,044
I don't think I can stay here, 
it's just so weird.

116
00:12:27,132 --> 00:12:30,488
We'll get some things together
and go to a hotel, OK?

117
00:12:30,572 --> 00:12:33,291
No. I don't think 
I can live here anymore.

118
00:12:33,852 --> 00:12:35,888
I think we should sell the house.

119
00:12:35,972 --> 00:12:38,770
Honey, wait a minute. 
You love this house.

120
00:12:38,852 --> 00:12:42,083
I know, but we really 
don't need this now.

121
00:12:42,172 --> 00:12:43,810
We're in way over our heads.

122
00:12:43,892 --> 00:12:46,770
- We can barely afford it.
- Don't get carried away.

123
00:12:46,852 --> 00:12:49,525
You know what we're gonna do? 
We're just...

124
00:12:49,612 --> 00:12:51,842
We're gonna take that cop's advice.

125
00:12:51,932 --> 00:12:55,288
Tomorrow morning, I'll make a few calls.
Come here.

126
00:12:55,372 --> 00:12:58,569
We'll get the best security system
known to man.

127
00:12:59,492 --> 00:13:01,483
If that doesn't do it,

128
00:13:01,852 --> 00:13:04,002
we'll get a... killer watchdog.

129
00:13:04,092 --> 00:13:08,244
A vicious... pit bull with fangs

130
00:13:08,332 --> 00:13:10,323
with a stud collar.

131
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,050
Come on, honey.

132
00:13:13,132 --> 00:13:15,123
We'll be all right.

133
00:13:17,052 --> 00:13:19,043
Come on.

134
00:13:19,852 --> 00:13:22,571
You chased him around with a putter?

135
00:13:22,652 --> 00:13:26,247
- You're a hero!
- Dirty Harry and Arnold Palmer all in one.

136
00:13:26,332 --> 00:13:29,927
It sounds pretty intense.
I'd have had a heart attack.

137
00:13:30,012 --> 00:13:32,003
You did OK. Are you guys all right?

138
00:13:32,092 --> 00:13:34,083
Yeah. Well, Karen's upset.

139
00:13:34,172 --> 00:13:36,163
Shit. Here he comes.

140
00:13:37,452 --> 00:13:39,443
Do we have to kiss him?

141
00:13:47,292 --> 00:13:49,089
Gentlemen.

142
00:13:49,852 --> 00:13:53,128
I read your prospectus.
Demographics look good.

143
00:13:53,212 --> 00:13:56,329
Jerry, I'm not a big believer 
in demographics.

144
00:13:56,412 --> 00:14:00,007
- I think it's a lawyer's tool, no offence.
- None taken.

145
00:14:00,092 --> 00:14:03,402
- Amazing place.
- The potential here is fantastic.

146
00:14:03,492 --> 00:14:08,168
I learnt to go with my instincts.
I used demographics once and went belly up.

147
00:14:08,252 --> 00:14:10,971
- Was that Denver?
- He's done his homework!

148
00:14:11,052 --> 00:14:14,328
You weren't the only one.
I put a lot of my clients' money there.

149
00:14:14,412 --> 00:14:16,323
Those buildings are still empty.

150
00:14:16,412 --> 00:14:18,130
That won't happen down here.

151
00:14:18,212 --> 00:14:21,409
This downtown area
has undergone a revitalization.

152
00:14:21,492 --> 00:14:24,529
The new buildings 
are all filled with people,

153
00:14:24,612 --> 00:14:28,048
all within shouting distance
of this place here.

154
00:14:28,132 --> 00:14:32,808
OK. I want to put on a backers' party
so you can get a feel for what could go on.

155
00:14:35,452 --> 00:14:36,680
It's mine.

156
00:14:38,012 --> 00:14:41,607
- Hello.
- Hi, it's me. Bad timing?

157
00:14:41,692 --> 00:14:44,286
We're in the middle of it, 
but we're close.

158
00:14:44,372 --> 00:14:46,044
What's going on?

159
00:14:46,132 --> 00:14:48,771
The security people 
haven't shown up yet.

160
00:14:48,852 --> 00:14:51,571
Neither have the police 
to dust for prints.

161
00:14:51,652 --> 00:14:54,450
- Did you call them?
- Yeah. I get a run-around.

162
00:14:54,532 --> 00:14:57,649
Great. OK, I tell you what.
Here's what you do.

163
00:14:58,212 --> 00:15:03,411
Call the police and ask to talk 
to those two cops from last night. 
I bet they can help.

164
00:15:03,492 --> 00:15:04,925
Well, OK. I'll try.

165
00:15:05,012 --> 00:15:07,572
I'll be home as soon as I can. 
You all right?

166
00:15:07,652 --> 00:15:09,643
Mm-hm. I love you.

167
00:15:09,732 --> 00:15:11,723
-  I like that!
- Bye.

168
00:15:14,252 --> 00:15:16,482
Michael, I'm being grilled here!

169
00:15:16,572 --> 00:15:19,928
This area's high crime, right?
You get the people in.

170
00:15:20,012 --> 00:15:22,048
How do you keep the bad element out?

171
00:15:23,092 --> 00:15:26,323
I'm into that as we speak.
I'm working on security now.

172
00:15:52,412 --> 00:15:54,721
Michael, you remember Officer Davis?

173
00:15:54,812 --> 00:15:58,600
Oh, yeah! How are you doing?
I didn't recognize you out of uniform.

174
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:01,445
- You did all this?
- Yeah, it's no big deal.

175
00:16:01,532 --> 00:16:05,241
- It is! We really appreciate it.
- It's the least I could do.

176
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:07,243
Mrs. Carr called my captain

177
00:16:07,332 --> 00:16:11,325
and said all kinds of nice things
about me and my partner, Roy.

178
00:16:11,412 --> 00:16:14,529
- It was nice, I appreciate it.
- Can I get you a beer?

179
00:16:14,612 --> 00:16:16,921
Sure, that would be great. Thanks.

180
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:23,168
There will be contact switches
on every point of entrance.

181
00:16:23,252 --> 00:16:27,086
A breeze won't be able
to get in this house without you knowing!

182
00:16:27,172 --> 00:16:30,005
Here, there will be
an infrared motion detector.

183
00:16:30,092 --> 00:16:33,289
This will detect if 
anybody breaks the glass.

184
00:16:33,652 --> 00:16:36,450
Hey! What's he doing in 
the bathroom here?

185
00:16:36,532 --> 00:16:38,523
Oh.

186
00:16:39,452 --> 00:16:42,444
It's just an extra precaution, 
it's a safe room.

187
00:16:44,612 --> 00:16:48,366
These old houses have doors 
like solid rock.

188
00:16:48,452 --> 00:16:51,285
We put a heavy dead bolt
on each entrance here.

189
00:16:51,372 --> 00:16:56,400
If there's an intruder, 
just lock yourself in and wait 
for the cavalry,

190
00:16:56,492 --> 00:16:57,527
which is us.

191
00:17:01,252 --> 00:17:04,528
Pick out a codeword.
It's got to be seven letters.

192
00:17:10,212 --> 00:17:11,804
Pyramid.

193
00:17:11,892 --> 00:17:13,325
Pyramid?

194
00:17:15,852 --> 00:17:17,808
This is the Michael Carr residence.

195
00:17:17,892 --> 00:17:20,122
The codeword's gonna be pyramid.

196
00:17:21,452 --> 00:17:23,443
Right. OK. Thank you.

197
00:17:23,972 --> 00:17:25,769
That's it.

198
00:17:26,852 --> 00:17:29,047
Oh, yeah.

199
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,646
- 440 cubes, 500 horses.
- Jesus!

200
00:17:31,732 --> 00:17:34,804
- Did you do the work yourself?
- Every nut and bolt.

201
00:17:34,892 --> 00:17:37,281
Installed the alarm. It relaxes me.

202
00:17:37,372 --> 00:17:40,967
- That is nice. Really nice.
- Thanks.

203
00:17:43,132 --> 00:17:46,568
Oh, man!
You've got a knack 
for this security stuff!

204
00:17:46,652 --> 00:17:49,769
Do you ever think about
consulting as a sideline?

205
00:17:49,852 --> 00:17:53,242
- Consulting?
- Yeah. Homes, businesses.

206
00:17:53,332 --> 00:17:55,892
I got a club 
I'm putting together downtown.

207
00:17:55,972 --> 00:17:58,122
What you're doing today,
but you get paid for your time.

208
00:17:58,212 --> 00:18:00,123
I never really thought about it much.

209
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:03,045
- You're staying for dinner, right?
- Yeah.

210
00:18:03,132 --> 00:18:05,088
- No.
- Are you doing anything?

211
00:18:05,172 --> 00:18:07,163
I'd be crossing the line.

212
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:10,449
Cops on one side,
everybody else on the other.

213
00:18:11,452 --> 00:18:13,443
Come on!

214
00:18:17,292 --> 00:18:20,568
This has really been nice.

215
00:18:20,652 --> 00:18:24,930
Usually dinner for me 
is a bunch of us telling 
boring war stories.

216
00:18:25,012 --> 00:18:28,084
Cops stick together
because nobody else could stand us!

217
00:18:28,172 --> 00:18:30,242
- You've never been married?
- No.

218
00:18:30,332 --> 00:18:32,926
She'll try to line you up
with one of her friends.

219
00:18:35,372 --> 00:18:37,932
- I'll get her, Jack.
- Sorry, Michael.

220
00:18:38,012 --> 00:18:40,401
She smells that meat and goes crazy.

221
00:18:40,492 --> 00:18:42,483
Meet me round the front.

222
00:18:42,572 --> 00:18:45,132
I'm sorry. I'm still a little freaked.

223
00:18:46,572 --> 00:18:48,563
That's OK.

224
00:18:48,652 --> 00:18:50,961
That's understandable.

225
00:18:51,052 --> 00:18:54,965
I can't believe
you've never been serious 
about anyone.

226
00:18:56,972 --> 00:18:58,883
No.

227
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:02,442
Cops and marriage are a tough combination.

228
00:19:02,532 --> 00:19:03,521
So...

229
00:19:03,612 --> 00:19:05,967
I can't believe how much I'm talking.

230
00:19:06,052 --> 00:19:08,441
When I was a kid, 
I hardly ever talked.

231
00:19:08,532 --> 00:19:10,807
When I was in school, 
I never talked.

232
00:19:10,892 --> 00:19:12,086
I was famous for it.

233
00:19:12,172 --> 00:19:13,161
Oh.

234
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,890
Take it from a teacher,

235
00:19:14,972 --> 00:19:18,248
we love those quiet boys
in the back of the class.

236
00:19:18,332 --> 00:19:21,847
Don't you believe her, Pete!
She loves all kids.

237
00:19:24,092 --> 00:19:25,764
That's what's missing.

238
00:19:25,852 --> 00:19:29,447
I'm surprised you two don't have
a few running around.

239
00:19:32,692 --> 00:19:34,683
I'm sorry about bringing up...

240
00:19:34,772 --> 00:19:37,411
..kids. It's really none of my business.

241
00:19:37,492 --> 00:19:39,528
Hey, I just wanted to thank you.

242
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:42,809
You really went out of your way.
It did so much for Karen.

243
00:19:42,892 --> 00:19:44,291
She'll bounce back.

244
00:19:44,372 --> 00:19:47,364
She'll bounce back
a lot quicker because of you.

245
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:50,012
What about you? Have you bounced back?

246
00:19:51,052 --> 00:19:53,043
I don't know.

247
00:19:53,132 --> 00:19:56,647
A guy gets his hands on your wife like that,
you feel helpless.

248
00:19:56,732 --> 00:19:58,882
You did what you could, Michael.

249
00:19:58,972 --> 00:20:01,088
You showed a lot of balls.

250
00:20:01,172 --> 00:20:03,163
There was one moment where

251
00:20:03,252 --> 00:20:06,528
he had a hold of her
and I had that stupid golf club,

252
00:20:06,612 --> 00:20:08,603
I thought I could just...

253
00:20:09,852 --> 00:20:12,127
I didn't... I didn't take the shot.

254
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:16,683
A fucking nightmare when you think
about what could have happened.

255
00:20:16,772 --> 00:20:20,128
I wouldn't mind one more shot
at that son of a bitch.

256
00:20:20,212 --> 00:20:22,203
- Really?
- Hell, yeah!

257
00:20:22,292 --> 00:20:24,408
I'd like to kick the shit out of him!

258
00:20:24,492 --> 00:20:26,687
- I'm sure you would.
- Wouldn't you?

259
00:20:26,772 --> 00:20:29,002
Oh, I already know what I would do.

260
00:20:29,372 --> 00:20:32,967
I'm just wondering about
a nice, civilized guy like you.

261
00:20:33,052 --> 00:20:37,125
After what he did to Karen,
I think all the rules are out the window.

262
00:20:37,212 --> 00:20:39,203
I'd rip his fucking heart out.

263
00:20:39,292 --> 00:20:41,203
Michael!

264
00:20:41,292 --> 00:20:43,283
You're a scary guy!

265
00:20:49,052 --> 00:20:51,043
Hey! You know,

266
00:20:51,132 --> 00:20:53,521
you'd enjoy coming on a ride-along.

267
00:20:53,612 --> 00:20:56,649
- What's that?
- Riding along with us on patrol one night.

268
00:20:56,732 --> 00:21:00,247
- You can do that?
- We often do for writers, journalists...

269
00:21:00,332 --> 00:21:02,004
Uh-huh. It sounds...

270
00:21:02,092 --> 00:21:03,810
Yeah, I could do that.

271
00:21:03,892 --> 00:21:07,407
Great. I'm gonna set it up.
You come watch us kick some butt.

272
00:21:07,492 --> 00:21:10,882
- When do you want to do it?
- Tomorrow.

273
00:21:10,972 --> 00:21:13,361
Come on. It'll be fun.

274
00:21:13,452 --> 00:21:15,363
Yeah. Why not?

275
00:21:15,452 --> 00:21:17,283
Great. I'll see you then.

276
00:21:29,452 --> 00:21:34,128
Sign it, so your old lady can't come after
the City if you get killed or maimed.

277
00:21:34,212 --> 00:21:36,521
Nothing will happen to him. He's with me.

278
00:21:37,132 --> 00:21:38,451
Hey, Pete.

279
00:21:41,452 --> 00:21:45,445
OK, Mike. A dope dealer,
a public defender and my ex-wife

280
00:21:45,532 --> 00:21:48,569
all get thrown off 
the Empire State Building.

281
00:21:48,652 --> 00:21:50,882
Which one hits the cement first?

282
00:21:50,972 --> 00:21:53,167
I don't know. Who lands first?

283
00:21:53,252 --> 00:21:55,243
Who cares!

284
00:21:57,692 --> 00:21:59,364
Oh, oh, oh!

285
00:21:59,452 --> 00:22:01,443
Oh, my gosh, look at this!

286
00:22:01,532 --> 00:22:04,126
Do you think she's a real blonde, Roy?

287
00:22:10,452 --> 00:22:12,249
Officer.

288
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:14,323
Was I going too fast?

289
00:22:14,412 --> 00:22:17,609
Do you have a license and a registration,
ma'am?

290
00:22:17,692 --> 00:22:19,683
Yes.

291
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:23,048
Certain types of women
just have a thing for cops.

292
00:22:23,132 --> 00:22:25,441
They think we're like movie stars.

293
00:22:50,412 --> 00:22:53,449
If we were to search
any one of these assholes,

294
00:22:53,532 --> 00:22:56,205
we'd be up to our butts 
in drugs and guns.

295
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:59,090
This place is one 
giant supermarket of shit.

296
00:22:59,172 --> 00:23:02,369
- Right, Leon?
- Whatever you say, Officer Pete.

297
00:23:02,452 --> 00:23:05,728
- This is Mr. Clean here.
- That's right, that's me.

298
00:23:05,812 --> 00:23:07,484
Yes, sir. Mr. Clean.

299
00:23:09,452 --> 00:23:11,044
Maria! ¿Como esta?

300
00:23:11,132 --> 00:23:12,850
Yeah!

301
00:23:12,932 --> 00:23:14,809
Everything OK? ¿No problemas?

302
00:23:14,892 --> 00:23:16,086
No, no problemas.

303
00:23:16,172 --> 00:23:18,163
If there is, let me know, OK?

304
00:23:21,052 --> 00:23:25,284
You won't be finding any clientele
for your club around here, Michael.

305
00:23:32,052 --> 00:23:34,612
Try it. The best in LA.

306
00:23:34,692 --> 00:23:36,842
You know, I ate before I came out.

307
00:23:36,932 --> 00:23:38,923
I'm really full.

308
00:23:41,172 --> 00:23:43,288
So, are you enjoying yourself?

309
00:23:43,372 --> 00:23:46,250
Yeah. Yeah, it's an eye-opener.

310
00:23:46,332 --> 00:23:51,360
Something occurred to me when you were
at the house for the barbecue, Pete.

311
00:23:51,452 --> 00:23:54,012
I don't know how it works
here in Los Angeles.

312
00:23:54,092 --> 00:23:55,650
When I was in Phoenix,

313
00:23:55,732 --> 00:23:59,361
I used to hire off-duty police officers
to ward the club.

314
00:23:59,452 --> 00:24:02,444
Hear that? Mike's offering us
moonlighting money.

315
00:24:02,532 --> 00:24:04,523
- I'd like to talk to you...
- Hi.

316
00:24:04,612 --> 00:24:06,125
Hi.

317
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:08,043
So, how are you?

318
00:24:08,132 --> 00:24:10,600
Are you like a captain, or something?

319
00:24:11,052 --> 00:24:13,043
Lieutenant.

320
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:16,368
Come on, ¡vamonos!

321
00:24:16,452 --> 00:24:19,171
Can't you see the lieutenant's married?

322
00:24:19,252 --> 00:24:21,243
Oh, yeah? Oh.

323
00:24:21,332 --> 00:24:23,323
Oh, well. Ya me voy.

324
00:24:23,412 --> 00:24:26,768
- Bye, Pete.
- See you later, Rosa.

325
00:24:26,852 --> 00:24:29,047
These bitches can't get enough of us.

326
00:24:37,052 --> 00:24:39,043
Michael, stay here.

327
00:24:43,492 --> 00:24:45,483
Keep away!

328
00:24:48,652 --> 00:24:50,608
Police! Everything all right in there?

329
00:24:50,692 --> 00:24:52,683
No! Everything is not all right!

330
00:24:52,772 --> 00:24:55,525
Fucking asshole jailbird
is on the fucking bed!

331
00:24:55,612 --> 00:24:57,568
Fuck you, fuck you.

332
00:25:12,492 --> 00:25:15,006
There you go. Are you all right?

333
00:25:15,412 --> 00:25:18,370
Come on, boy.
Why don't you stay here with me?

334
00:25:18,452 --> 00:25:20,682
Roy, I'm taking him out.

335
00:25:20,772 --> 00:25:25,607
Take that piece of shit
back to the jailhouse where he belongs!

336
00:25:26,412 --> 00:25:28,767
Mom! Mommy!

337
00:25:36,172 --> 00:25:38,732
See? They got him.

338
00:25:50,252 --> 00:25:52,891
Roy, why don't you go
and get yourself cleaned up?

339
00:25:52,972 --> 00:25:55,327
Me and Michael will put the car to bed.

340
00:25:55,412 --> 00:25:57,403
It works for me.

341
00:25:57,492 --> 00:25:59,642
- Later, gentlemen.
- Take care.

342
00:26:04,052 --> 00:26:06,122
It's a hell of a life, huh, Mike?

343
00:26:06,292 --> 00:26:09,170
- Is it always like this?
- Day in and day out.

344
00:26:09,252 --> 00:26:11,243
Come on. Hop up in front.

345
00:26:13,012 --> 00:26:16,448
Your wife wants to know
why I can't meet a nice woman.

346
00:26:17,172 --> 00:26:20,084
I thought you guys 
handled it all pretty well.

347
00:26:20,172 --> 00:26:22,288
Where are we headed?

348
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,602
Just got one more errand to run.

349
00:26:35,132 --> 00:26:37,043
Come on! Move!

350
00:26:37,132 --> 00:26:38,406
Michael!

351
00:26:42,492 --> 00:26:43,607
Stay there.

352
00:26:43,692 --> 00:26:46,729
Michael. Meet Ernie Pike.

353
00:26:46,812 --> 00:26:48,928
Come out and ID this piece of shit.

354
00:26:49,012 --> 00:26:51,003
Come on, motherfucker!

355
00:26:51,892 --> 00:26:54,929
That's him!
You got him, goddamn! That's him.

356
00:26:55,012 --> 00:26:57,446
Did you hear that? 
You've just been made.

357
00:26:58,452 --> 00:27:00,602
You've just been made, scumbag!

358
00:27:01,972 --> 00:27:05,487
Picked up a crackhead pal of his.
Turned in Pike here.

359
00:27:06,332 --> 00:27:09,051
You broke into my friend's house? Huh?

360
00:27:09,132 --> 00:27:11,600
Did you scare him and his pretty wife?

361
00:27:11,732 --> 00:27:13,802
Did you do that? Did you do that?

362
00:27:13,892 --> 00:27:17,123
OK. I'm sorry, man. OK?

363
00:27:17,212 --> 00:27:19,203
Fuck off!

364
00:27:20,292 --> 00:27:22,522
He doesn't want to hear you're sorry.

365
00:27:23,612 --> 00:27:25,603
He wants to kick your ass!

366
00:27:25,692 --> 00:27:27,683
Guess what, scumbag?

367
00:27:27,772 --> 00:27:29,763
I'm gonna let him.

368
00:27:30,852 --> 00:27:33,571
- Ready?
- What?

369
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,608
What are you waiting for? 
Let's go.

370
00:27:35,692 --> 00:27:37,569
Are you serious?

371
00:27:37,652 --> 00:27:40,689
Yeah! You said you wanted
to rip his fucking heart out!

372
00:27:40,772 --> 00:27:42,569
Well, yeah, yeah.

373
00:27:42,652 --> 00:27:45,769
But, I mean, that was... 
just talking.

374
00:27:45,852 --> 00:27:47,763
Tell him. Say it!

375
00:27:47,852 --> 00:27:50,241
Say how you wanted that uptown pussy.

376
00:27:50,332 --> 00:27:53,449
- Is that what you wanted? Say it!
- No, man.

377
00:27:53,532 --> 00:27:56,649
Say it! Tell him!

378
00:27:56,732 --> 00:27:58,688
Whatever you say, man.

379
00:27:59,292 --> 00:28:00,725
Come here!

380
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:02,803
Don't fucking resist me!

381
00:28:02,892 --> 00:28:04,883
Don't you resist me!

382
00:28:06,492 --> 00:28:08,483
Now, walk!

383
00:28:08,572 --> 00:28:10,563
I said walk.

384
00:28:11,972 --> 00:28:16,284
I just gave you the OK.
You don't even have to touch him.

385
00:28:16,372 --> 00:28:18,761
I wasn't going to hurt nobody, man.

386
00:28:18,852 --> 00:28:20,444
Shut up.

387
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,922
Come on!
Come on, Michael. It's OK, listen.

388
00:28:24,012 --> 00:28:26,651
He resisted, he gets hit. Shit happens.

389
00:28:26,732 --> 00:28:28,723
Come on, Pete. You got him.

390
00:28:28,812 --> 00:28:30,689
Nice going. Just take him in.

391
00:28:30,772 --> 00:28:34,162
Michael... 
He put a knife to Karen's throat.

392
00:28:34,252 --> 00:28:37,164
Are you going to let him 
get away with that?

393
00:28:37,252 --> 00:28:38,651
Come on! Hit the motherfucker!

394
00:28:38,732 --> 00:28:40,529
- Pete...
- Hit him!

395
00:28:40,612 --> 00:28:42,091
He's just...

396
00:28:42,172 --> 00:28:44,163
Hey, no. I'm not doing this.

397
00:28:44,852 --> 00:28:46,843
Hey!

398
00:28:50,332 --> 00:28:52,448
Motherfucker!

399
00:28:54,292 --> 00:28:57,364
Pete! Pete! Jesus, that's enough!

400
00:29:11,732 --> 00:29:13,723
Honey?

401
00:29:14,572 --> 00:29:16,164
Michael?

402
00:29:16,252 --> 00:29:18,846
Yeah. It's me.

403
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,963
How did it go?

404
00:29:30,172 --> 00:29:32,163
Boy, what a screwed-up night.

405
00:29:32,252 --> 00:29:33,765
What happened?

406
00:29:33,852 --> 00:29:35,843
It was just... It was weird.

407
00:29:37,292 --> 00:29:41,205
I went with the guys on a few calls.
Got to watch them be cops.

408
00:29:43,332 --> 00:29:47,007
We dropped Roy off
and Pete had a little surprise for me.

409
00:29:47,332 --> 00:29:49,004
The guy who broke in here.

410
00:29:49,092 --> 00:29:51,811
- He caught him?
- He did a little more than that.

411
00:29:51,892 --> 00:29:55,168
- The guy's in jail?
- Hospital's more likely.

412
00:29:55,252 --> 00:30:00,201
He beat the living shit out of this guy,
which is what I was supposed to do.

413
00:30:00,292 --> 00:30:03,762
- I don't understand.
- Pete was showing off for me.

414
00:30:03,852 --> 00:30:07,731
He had it all set up, so I could be
the big man and nail the guy.

415
00:30:07,812 --> 00:30:09,768
Michael, I'm just glad it's over.

416
00:30:09,852 --> 00:30:11,251
Yeah.

417
00:30:14,972 --> 00:30:16,963
Are you sure you're OK?

418
00:30:17,052 --> 00:30:19,043
Yeah.

419
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:23,043
What's the matter, huh?

420
00:30:23,852 --> 00:30:25,843
Just...

421
00:30:25,932 --> 00:30:30,164
I think our cop friend
is a little too tightly wound, 
that's all.

422
00:30:30,252 --> 00:30:33,688
Do you think you might be
overreacting a little bit?

423
00:30:34,292 --> 00:30:36,283
Not really.

424
00:30:37,212 --> 00:30:39,965
I feel like a big weight's been lifted.

425
00:30:40,052 --> 00:30:42,407
Yeah. I'm glad you feel better.

426
00:30:42,492 --> 00:30:45,370
But I'm serious.
I don't want him here anymore.

427
00:30:45,452 --> 00:30:47,283
You're upset and I understand,

428
00:30:47,372 --> 00:30:50,364
but shouldn't we give him the
benefit of the doubt?

429
00:30:50,452 --> 00:30:53,603
Maybe he got rough,
but you're acting like Pete's 
the criminal.

430
00:30:53,692 --> 00:30:56,729
Am I? I was there, Karen. I saw it.

431
00:30:56,812 --> 00:31:00,009
I don't care what you think.
We stay away from this guy.

432
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:02,083
You don't care what I think?

433
00:31:02,172 --> 00:31:04,163
Fine. I won't bother thinking.

434
00:31:04,252 --> 00:31:06,527
- Knock it off.
- No, you knock it off!

435
00:31:06,612 --> 00:31:09,410
I'm sorry, 
but I don't share your sympathy

436
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:13,565
for the man who broke in here
and put a goddamn knife to my throat.

437
00:32:10,452 --> 00:32:12,886
Hi. Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

438
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:15,122
It's OK.

439
00:32:15,212 --> 00:32:18,124
Can I talk to you for a minute? 
Please?

440
00:32:18,212 --> 00:32:20,203
Just let me get my robe.

441
00:32:30,452 --> 00:32:33,171
You really should 
put a lock on that gate.

442
00:32:34,572 --> 00:32:37,609
I don't think you came here
to discuss my gate.

443
00:32:37,692 --> 00:32:39,683
No.

444
00:32:41,932 --> 00:32:44,321
Did you hear I arrested the burglar?

445
00:32:44,412 --> 00:32:46,403
What happened?

446
00:32:47,252 --> 00:32:50,528
What happened was
the burglar knocked me down

447
00:32:50,612 --> 00:32:52,409
and took off running.

448
00:32:52,492 --> 00:32:54,722
When I caught him, he resisted

449
00:32:54,812 --> 00:32:56,768
and it got ugly.

450
00:32:56,852 --> 00:32:59,412
I don't think Michael 
took it too well.

451
00:32:59,492 --> 00:33:01,642
He didn't quite put it that way.

452
00:33:02,812 --> 00:33:05,280
It's not a TV show out there, Mrs. Carr.

453
00:33:05,372 --> 00:33:08,967
The reality gets to people
who've never seen it up close.

454
00:33:09,052 --> 00:33:11,043
You mean the violence.

455
00:33:13,052 --> 00:33:15,043
Look,

456
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:18,443
when I first started out,

457
00:33:18,532 --> 00:33:20,523
I went on a routine call.

458
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:23,841
There was a young kid high on drugs.

459
00:33:23,932 --> 00:33:26,162
He was beating on his girlfriend.

460
00:33:26,732 --> 00:33:29,610
She couldn't have been more than 15, 16;

461
00:33:29,692 --> 00:33:32,252
sweet girl, blonde hair, blue eyes.

462
00:33:32,332 --> 00:33:34,641
So I didn't pay her much attention.

463
00:33:35,452 --> 00:33:37,841
I was reading the kid his rights,

464
00:33:38,732 --> 00:33:42,168
when she took out a gun
and she shot me right here

465
00:33:42,252 --> 00:33:44,243
in the chest.

466
00:33:45,612 --> 00:33:48,490
Now I restrain felons first
with whatever it takes.

467
00:33:48,572 --> 00:33:52,042
With whatever it takes.
That's how it was last night.

468
00:33:52,132 --> 00:33:56,284
I don't need another bullet in the chest,
you don't need a dead husband.

469
00:33:56,372 --> 00:33:58,602
I'm very sorry if Michael's upset.

470
00:33:58,692 --> 00:34:00,683
I was just doing my job.

471
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:02,888
Pete... Pete, wait.

472
00:34:08,052 --> 00:34:10,043
I'm glad you got him.

473
00:34:12,332 --> 00:34:17,645
That guy's not going to forget the night
he made the mistake of breaking in here!

474
00:34:19,532 --> 00:34:21,523
OK. Enjoy your swim.

475
00:34:46,052 --> 00:34:48,043
This is the Chromalight.

476
00:34:48,132 --> 00:34:52,683
It's the backdrop to the dance floor,
which could also spill out 
onto this floor.

477
00:34:52,772 --> 00:34:55,684
With this Chromalight,
we can create any environment.

478
00:34:55,772 --> 00:34:59,606
This is a cityscape but we can create
a desert, a mountain... anything.

479
00:35:05,012 --> 00:35:08,800
Why didn't I know Michael
had so many good-looking friends?

480
00:35:08,892 --> 00:35:11,611
Are you kidding?
We don't know any of these people.

481
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:15,162
They're potential investors
or friends of Michael's lawyer.

482
00:35:17,132 --> 00:35:19,123
That's too bad!

483
00:35:20,372 --> 00:35:22,522
Now, there's one I'd like to meet.

484
00:35:24,412 --> 00:35:26,972
That's the guy I was telling you about.

485
00:35:27,052 --> 00:35:29,043
Your cop? Really?

486
00:35:37,452 --> 00:35:40,250
- Candace said the music is too loud.
- What? Who?

487
00:35:40,332 --> 00:35:42,800
- Candace, my wife.
- I like it like this.

488
00:35:42,892 --> 00:35:45,201
Roger, I got a question 
only you can answer.

489
00:35:45,292 --> 00:35:49,763
I got an IRS auditor and a lawyer
on top of the World Trade Center.

490
00:35:49,852 --> 00:35:52,082
They both jump off at the same time.

491
00:35:52,172 --> 00:35:54,163
- Who lands first?
- Who cares!

492
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:56,083
Hi! How are you doing, Mike?

493
00:35:56,172 --> 00:35:57,161
Pete.

494
00:35:57,252 --> 00:35:59,243
This place is great.

495
00:35:59,332 --> 00:36:01,323
Thanks.

496
00:36:02,332 --> 00:36:04,323
Pete Davis, Los Angeles Police.

497
00:36:04,492 --> 00:36:06,084
Hello, Pete. Jerry Lurie.

498
00:36:06,172 --> 00:36:07,844
- My wife Candace.
- Hi, Pete.

499
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:08,842
Roger Graham.

500
00:36:08,932 --> 00:36:11,605
Mike's been talking to me 
about club security.

501
00:36:11,692 --> 00:36:14,081
Are you working the area tonight?

502
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:18,051
No,... 
I did the precheck of the exterior.

503
00:36:19,812 --> 00:36:24,932
I know it's normal to have your entrance
under the marquee, but it's too open.

504
00:36:25,012 --> 00:36:29,688
It would be better to put the entrance
in the alley and make the people line up.

505
00:36:29,772 --> 00:36:33,685
So if we ever have to get heavy,
only a few people will see it.

506
00:36:33,772 --> 00:36:35,763
Something to think about.

507
00:36:37,332 --> 00:36:41,723
Why don't you get yourself a drink
and I'll be with you in a minute?

508
00:36:42,212 --> 00:36:45,329
Good idea.
I know you have business to discuss.

509
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:46,970
I'll fill you in later.

510
00:36:47,052 --> 00:36:48,804
Take care. Nice meeting you.

511
00:36:48,892 --> 00:36:51,406
He makes a lot of sense.

512
00:36:51,492 --> 00:36:54,609
You guys really aren't bullshitting.

513
00:36:55,172 --> 00:36:58,642
- I take security very seriously.
- We're really on top of it.

514
00:36:59,532 --> 00:37:01,284
Hi there.

515
00:37:01,372 --> 00:37:03,363
Oh, Penny. This is Pete.

516
00:37:03,452 --> 00:37:05,488
- Pete, Penny.
- Hi. Nice meeting you.

517
00:37:05,572 --> 00:37:07,449
Hi, nice meeting you.

518
00:37:07,532 --> 00:37:11,002
- We teach together.
- Oh! Oh...

519
00:37:11,092 --> 00:37:14,971
The pupils would be so impressed
that I'm talking to you. 
They love cops.

520
00:37:15,052 --> 00:37:17,725
They're young. Give them time!

521
00:37:18,772 --> 00:37:21,684
Maybe you'd like
to give them a talk some time?

522
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:23,171
Umm...

523
00:37:23,252 --> 00:37:24,571
Yeah, sure.

524
00:37:24,652 --> 00:37:27,246
Public relations, love stuff like that.

525
00:37:27,332 --> 00:37:30,244
Speaking of public relations, 
do you dance?

526
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:32,527
Honey! Can you rescue Roger for me?

527
00:37:32,612 --> 00:37:33,761
Hi, Penny.

528
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:35,968
Come on, Pete. Let's get that drink.

529
00:37:37,052 --> 00:37:39,043
Here's to your club, Mike.

530
00:37:40,012 --> 00:37:41,081
Pete.

531
00:37:41,172 --> 00:37:43,640
I want to get something straight here.

532
00:37:43,732 --> 00:37:45,165
I'd like you to leave.

533
00:37:45,252 --> 00:37:47,607
Michael, what is with you tonight?

534
00:37:47,692 --> 00:37:49,922
Why did you even invite me here?

535
00:37:50,012 --> 00:37:54,483
Telling you and inviting you
are two completely different things.

536
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:56,563
You seem so uptight. Relax!

537
00:37:56,652 --> 00:37:59,371
Is it because you were up late last night?

538
00:37:59,452 --> 00:38:01,443
How do you know that?

539
00:38:01,532 --> 00:38:05,241
I drove past your house on patrol
and saw your lights were on.

540
00:38:05,332 --> 00:38:07,050
You went to bed after three.

541
00:38:07,132 --> 00:38:10,124
You don't have to protect us now.
You caught him.

542
00:38:10,212 --> 00:38:12,851
One guy's caught 
and you think that's it?

543
00:38:12,932 --> 00:38:16,368
You saw how much evil shit
there is out there.

544
00:38:16,452 --> 00:38:20,525
What kind of friend would I be
if I didn't try to protect you and Karen?

545
00:38:20,612 --> 00:38:24,685
God damn it, you listen to me,
‘cause I'm telling you, leave us alone!

546
00:38:26,052 --> 00:38:30,011
You know, I think I understand
where this is coming from.

547
00:38:30,092 --> 00:38:32,811
- Do you?
- Just cut the shit, OK?

548
00:38:33,172 --> 00:38:37,165
Nobody expects you to be me,
I'm a cop.

549
00:38:37,252 --> 00:38:39,766
I make my living 
tackling guys like Pike.

550
00:38:39,852 --> 00:38:41,843
You don't. You needn't be ashamed.

551
00:38:41,932 --> 00:38:43,843
- You think this is about that?
- Yeah.

552
00:38:43,932 --> 00:38:47,845
I bet you had one hell of a night
last night when you got home.

553
00:38:47,932 --> 00:38:50,162
Juices flowing and everything.

554
00:38:50,252 --> 00:38:52,208
A friend would be thanking me.

555
00:38:52,292 --> 00:38:55,807
I'm not your friend.
I'm nothing to you. You got that?

556
00:38:55,892 --> 00:38:59,362
You're a sick guy.
I don't want you around me or my wife.

557
00:38:59,452 --> 00:39:02,330
- Michael, your guests...
- I'll be there in a second.

558
00:39:02,412 --> 00:39:05,722
Michael needs
to get some things off his chest.

559
00:39:05,812 --> 00:39:07,564
- Roger...
- Honey, please!

560
00:39:07,652 --> 00:39:10,610
- Are you kicking me out?
- Don't keep them waiting.

561
00:39:10,692 --> 00:39:12,284
If I have to.

562
00:39:12,372 --> 00:39:15,011
Tell Roger 
I'll be there in a second, OK?

563
00:39:22,132 --> 00:39:24,123
What are you gonna do?

564
00:39:24,852 --> 00:39:27,207
Call the cops?

565
00:39:28,172 --> 00:39:29,241
Get the fuck out.

566
00:39:29,332 --> 00:39:30,287
Lower your voice.

567
00:39:30,372 --> 00:39:32,886
Fuck you. Fuck you!

568
00:39:32,972 --> 00:39:34,963
The pigeon's watching.

569
00:39:38,772 --> 00:39:40,967
I hope he doesn't fly away on you.

570
00:40:10,332 --> 00:40:12,323
Can I get your car?

571
00:40:13,572 --> 00:40:15,563
Ticket.

572
00:40:21,012 --> 00:40:23,890
Weren't you a little rough on Pete?

573
00:40:23,972 --> 00:40:27,760
I don't want him coming round.
I wanted to make that clear.

574
00:40:27,852 --> 00:40:29,888
- You succeeded.
- Honey, please.

575
00:40:29,972 --> 00:40:32,122
Come on, it's time for our toast.

576
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:43,969
Good health, good fortune,
and the time to enjoy it.

577
00:40:44,052 --> 00:40:46,043
It's an old Castilian toast.

578
00:40:48,532 --> 00:40:52,844
It looks like you've just
made these two people very happy.

579
00:40:52,932 --> 00:40:56,208
I think we'll all have 
reason to be happy

580
00:40:56,292 --> 00:40:58,760
when everything falls in place, Roger.

581
00:41:01,052 --> 00:41:03,043
That is a nice ride!

582
00:41:08,812 --> 00:41:13,249
To the most charming women here!
Your beautiful wife and mine.

583
00:42:17,412 --> 00:42:19,403
I'm glad you called.

584
00:42:20,212 --> 00:42:23,010
I've been thinking about you 
a lot lately.

585
00:42:32,692 --> 00:42:34,683
Leave it.

586
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:37,443
Sorry.

587
00:42:38,452 --> 00:42:40,443
Still sensitive, huh?

588
00:42:43,452 --> 00:42:45,522
Did you get shot or something?

589
00:42:48,852 --> 00:42:50,843
It was a fishing accident.

590
00:42:51,692 --> 00:42:53,683
Yeah!

591
00:42:53,772 --> 00:42:55,763
Fishes with guns.

592
00:43:03,052 --> 00:43:05,043
Are you all right?

593
00:43:06,452 --> 00:43:08,443
Cos we can go to a motel.

594
00:43:08,532 --> 00:43:10,523
A nice, cozy bed

595
00:43:10,612 --> 00:43:12,603
if you're having a problem.

596
00:43:13,612 --> 00:43:15,603
Problem...

597
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:29,326
The only problem that I have

598
00:43:31,012 --> 00:43:33,845
is sleazy, low-life whores like you.

599
00:43:35,052 --> 00:43:37,441
That's my problem.

600
00:43:38,652 --> 00:43:40,608
What the hell's wrong with you?

601
00:43:40,692 --> 00:43:43,126
- Get out.
- I'm not getting out here!

602
00:43:43,212 --> 00:43:45,806
- Get the fuck out!
- Are you crazy?

603
00:43:45,892 --> 00:43:50,363
- I don't know where the fuck I am!
- That's exactly your fucking problem!

604
00:43:50,692 --> 00:43:52,683
Isn't it?

605
00:44:04,932 --> 00:44:09,244
So, being a policeman is really 
all about helping people.

606
00:44:09,852 --> 00:44:11,843
It's about being a friend.

607
00:44:11,932 --> 00:44:15,129
It's not about shooting it out with bad guys,

608
00:44:15,212 --> 00:44:17,203
that's what you see on TV.

609
00:44:17,292 --> 00:44:19,852
That's not why I wanted to become a cop.

610
00:44:19,932 --> 00:44:22,890
I wanted to become a cop 
to protect people,

611
00:44:22,972 --> 00:44:26,203
to make them feel happy and safe.

612
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:29,011
- Everybody understand that?
- Yes.

613
00:44:29,092 --> 00:44:31,287
Anybody have any questions?

614
00:44:31,372 --> 00:44:33,966
- What?
- Do you wear bulletproof vests?

615
00:44:34,052 --> 00:44:35,963
I have to, to protect myself.

616
00:44:36,052 --> 00:44:37,451
Who else?

617
00:44:37,532 --> 00:44:40,729
In the police car,
are you always with somebody?

618
00:44:40,812 --> 00:44:43,690
I have a partner.
His name is Officer Roy Cole.

619
00:44:43,772 --> 00:44:47,526
We've spent time together
for the past seven, eight years.

620
00:44:47,612 --> 00:44:49,568
He's a very good friend of mine.

621
00:44:49,652 --> 00:44:50,641
OK, you.

622
00:44:50,732 --> 00:44:53,246
Could you show me
how to use your handcuffs?

623
00:44:53,332 --> 00:44:54,845
Sure.

624
00:44:54,932 --> 00:44:56,763
Come here.

625
00:44:56,852 --> 00:44:58,843
- What's your name?
- Matthew.

626
00:44:58,932 --> 00:45:00,285
All right, Matthew.

627
00:45:00,372 --> 00:45:01,805
Put your hands out.

628
00:45:03,252 --> 00:45:06,210
Do you think I could get him
to use those on me?

629
00:45:06,292 --> 00:45:09,284
There you go.
You're under arrest, Matthew!

630
00:45:14,052 --> 00:45:18,842
Hi. I couldn't go 
without saying thanks
for letting me impress the kids.

631
00:45:18,932 --> 00:45:21,810
- It was a lot of fun.
- Penny really set it up.

632
00:45:21,892 --> 00:45:23,962
Yeah, I talked to Penny before.

633
00:45:25,092 --> 00:45:27,765
I'd like to apologize 
for the other night.

634
00:45:27,852 --> 00:45:30,969
- Michael's behavior...
- It took me by surprise.

635
00:45:31,052 --> 00:45:34,328
He invited me and kicked me out.
I would never have come.

636
00:45:34,412 --> 00:45:36,403
Pete, it's not you, it's him.

637
00:45:36,492 --> 00:45:38,483
He's not been himself lately.

638
00:45:39,772 --> 00:45:42,240
Would you like to go get 
a cup of coffee?

639
00:45:42,332 --> 00:45:44,323
I... don't go on for a while.

640
00:45:44,412 --> 00:45:46,607
I don't think it's such a good idea.

641
00:45:46,692 --> 00:45:49,889
Come on, you're safe with me.
I'm a cop, remember!

642
00:45:49,972 --> 00:45:52,691
- Just for a little while?
- Yeah. Just...

643
00:46:00,932 --> 00:46:02,923
Is everybody in here a cop?

644
00:46:03,012 --> 00:46:05,003
Yeah, pretty much.

645
00:46:05,092 --> 00:46:07,765
About a year ago,
some jerk came in here

646
00:46:07,852 --> 00:46:10,082
and tried to rip this place off!

647
00:46:11,452 --> 00:46:14,842
When he finally come
crashing through the skylight,

648
00:46:14,932 --> 00:46:16,923
I say, "How's your dick?"

649
00:46:17,012 --> 00:46:19,651
I'm sorry. 
We should go somewhere else.

650
00:46:19,732 --> 00:46:22,166
- No, this is great.
- Really?

651
00:46:22,252 --> 00:46:25,449
I think it's really nice you've 
got a place to go.

652
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:27,523
I'd like one. Just...

653
00:46:27,612 --> 00:46:29,807
This is...

654
00:46:29,892 --> 00:46:32,690
This is my least favorite 
time of the day.

655
00:46:32,772 --> 00:46:35,081
- Why?
- Umm...

656
00:46:35,172 --> 00:46:38,926
I guess it's getting dark out
and Michael's not home yet.

657
00:46:40,852 --> 00:46:43,241
How did you and Michael get together?

658
00:46:45,812 --> 00:46:48,770
- I was a waitress in his first club.
- Really?

659
00:46:48,852 --> 00:46:52,162
- You were a waitress?
- It was the first job I ever had.

660
00:46:52,252 --> 00:46:54,243
The first one I needed.

661
00:46:55,452 --> 00:46:57,443
We were kind of well off.

662
00:46:57,532 --> 00:47:02,083
My father, as it turned out,
had sort of gambling problems.

663
00:47:02,172 --> 00:47:04,163
And I, umm...

664
00:47:04,252 --> 00:47:08,325
People started coming over
and taking our cars in the night.

665
00:47:08,412 --> 00:47:10,448
It was kind of a scary time.

666
00:47:10,532 --> 00:47:12,762
Did Michael take you away 
from all that?

667
00:47:12,852 --> 00:47:16,401
Things always came 
really easily to Michael.

668
00:47:16,492 --> 00:47:18,483
Is that why you married him?

669
00:47:22,412 --> 00:47:25,370
I married him because 
I fell in love with him.

670
00:47:32,052 --> 00:47:34,043
This is...

671
00:47:35,252 --> 00:47:37,243
I hardly know you

672
00:47:37,332 --> 00:47:39,402
and we're talking like this.

673
00:47:39,492 --> 00:47:43,405
Karen, all the things
that come so easily to Michael,

674
00:47:43,492 --> 00:47:45,483
were you one of them?

675
00:47:45,572 --> 00:47:48,564
Because there's no man deserves
that much good fortune.

676
00:47:48,652 --> 00:47:51,041
And I mean that.

677
00:47:51,132 --> 00:47:54,647
A woman like you,
a man should never take for granted.

678
00:47:54,852 --> 00:47:57,924
And you should never feel unsafe.

679
00:47:58,892 --> 00:48:00,610
And I want you to know,

680
00:48:00,692 --> 00:48:03,252
that if you ever need anything,

681
00:48:03,332 --> 00:48:07,086
you're feeling bad in any way
or you just need to talk,

682
00:48:07,172 --> 00:48:09,640
then I’m there for you.

683
00:48:09,732 --> 00:48:11,723
OK? As a friend.

684
00:48:11,812 --> 00:48:14,121
As a real friend, I’m there for you.

685
00:48:16,652 --> 00:48:18,643
OK?

686
00:48:21,652 --> 00:48:23,051
Come on.

687
00:48:23,132 --> 00:48:25,123
Let me get you out of here.

688
00:49:05,652 --> 00:49:07,643
How was your afternoon?

689
00:49:07,732 --> 00:49:09,723
Hey, good. It was fine.

690
00:49:11,252 --> 00:49:13,482
You and Mrs. Carr getting along OK?

691
00:49:21,452 --> 00:49:23,727
We seem to be.

692
00:49:28,692 --> 00:49:30,523
When I was a kid at Erasmus,

693
00:49:30,612 --> 00:49:34,366
I didn't have a single teacher
that looked like Karen.

694
00:49:34,452 --> 00:49:38,764
They all had blue hair with names
like Mushbutt or Silvercrone.

695
00:49:40,772 --> 00:49:42,922
Silvercrone's my maiden name.

696
00:49:46,052 --> 00:49:48,043
She had me!

697
00:49:50,212 --> 00:49:53,602
The good news is Frank Taft
was so taken with you,

698
00:49:53,692 --> 00:49:56,331
he's considering 
kicking in half the capital.

699
00:49:56,412 --> 00:49:59,609
- Frank Taft... Blue Moon Records?
- We handle him.

700
00:49:59,692 --> 00:50:02,331
- That company's on a roll.
- Major roll.

701
00:50:02,412 --> 00:50:04,289
I don't listen to that shit myself...

702
00:50:04,372 --> 00:50:06,522
Sorry, sir. Do you have another card?

703
00:50:06,612 --> 00:50:08,807
- What's the problem?
- It's cancelled.

704
00:50:08,892 --> 00:50:11,008
It's impossible.

705
00:50:11,092 --> 00:50:13,128
Computer glitch. It happens to me.

706
00:50:13,212 --> 00:50:15,248
This is... It's unbelievable.

707
00:50:15,332 --> 00:50:17,402
Relax, you'll get the next one.

708
00:50:21,092 --> 00:50:23,890
All right, 
now we're on for Tuesday night.

709
00:50:23,972 --> 00:50:26,202
- Bye!
- Take care.

710
00:50:26,292 --> 00:50:28,283
Michael, what's that?

711
00:50:28,372 --> 00:50:31,648
It looks like you're having a bad night, Michael.

712
00:50:35,732 --> 00:50:39,088
All I know is what's on
the computer printout.

713
00:50:39,172 --> 00:50:41,766
It says you have
parking tickets up the wazoo.

714
00:50:41,852 --> 00:50:43,649
And the computer is wrong.

715
00:50:43,732 --> 00:50:46,405
I'm not paying $600.
for tickets I didn't get.

716
00:50:46,492 --> 00:50:48,448
I've been working here five years.

717
00:50:48,532 --> 00:50:50,523
The computer's never wrong.

718
00:50:50,612 --> 00:50:53,490
Do you want the boot
taken off your car or not?

719
00:50:54,372 --> 00:50:56,442
Unbelievable.

720
00:50:58,612 --> 00:51:00,603
Wait a minute, not that one.

721
00:51:03,572 --> 00:51:05,642
Honey, are you sure about this?

722
00:51:05,732 --> 00:51:09,008
Remember the night
we went to the Minzers' house?

723
00:51:09,092 --> 00:51:11,481
They had the party on Canyon Avenue.

724
00:51:11,572 --> 00:51:14,769
I got a ticket, one ticket.
$600? Come on, Jesus!

725
00:51:14,892 --> 00:51:17,611
Sorry, pal, 
you're over the limit on this card.

726
00:51:25,252 --> 00:51:28,449
It's a computer thing, 
like Roger said.

727
00:51:28,532 --> 00:51:30,523
Yeah, all right.

728
00:51:32,532 --> 00:51:34,807
$600.

729
00:51:34,892 --> 00:51:38,282
Michael, drop it!
Things went pretty well, didn't they?

730
00:51:38,372 --> 00:51:40,932
- Yeah.
- I thought they went pretty good.

731
00:51:41,012 --> 00:51:43,162
You know what?

732
00:51:43,252 --> 00:51:45,846
They went great.

733
00:51:47,372 --> 00:51:51,923
- You really charmed the pants off Lurie.
- Oh, please!

734
00:51:52,012 --> 00:51:54,003
Thanks.

735
00:52:55,492 --> 00:52:57,244
Stay here and lock the door.

736
00:52:57,332 --> 00:52:59,004
- What are you doing?
- Do it!

737
00:53:24,252 --> 00:53:26,049
Karen, it's all right.

738
00:53:28,652 --> 00:53:30,643
Hello, yes.

739
00:53:30,732 --> 00:53:32,529
This is Michael Carr.

740
00:53:32,612 --> 00:53:35,410
Codeword is pyramid.

741
00:53:35,492 --> 00:53:38,529
We just had our cat
knock over a screen door.

742
00:53:38,612 --> 00:53:40,330
Thank you. Bye.

743
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:44,850
I never thought 
I'd be so happy to see him.

744
00:53:51,252 --> 00:53:53,720
I thought it was the right thing to do.

745
00:53:53,812 --> 00:53:57,725
Thank you for making that decision
for both of us without my having a say.

746
00:53:57,812 --> 00:54:00,372
God damn it, 
you know how I feel about guns!

747
00:54:00,452 --> 00:54:04,127
You know how I feel watching a man
come into my home and attack my wife?

748
00:54:04,212 --> 00:54:06,931
I won't be in that position again, Karen.

749
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:12,407
I don't care what the police say.
I'm keeping that gun.

750
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:17,761
I'm sorry. I should have told you.

751
00:54:21,732 --> 00:54:23,723
Are you all right?

752
00:54:23,812 --> 00:54:25,291
Yeah.

753
00:54:25,372 --> 00:54:26,964
Are you?

754
00:55:36,932 --> 00:55:38,923
Jesus Christ!

755
00:55:39,012 --> 00:55:41,003
Just a goddamn minute! Hey!

756
00:55:41,612 --> 00:55:43,443
What the fuck are you doing?

757
00:55:43,532 --> 00:55:46,330
I was responding to your alarm, Michael.

758
00:55:46,412 --> 00:55:49,131
- Bullshit! You tripped it yourself!
- What?

759
00:55:49,212 --> 00:55:52,761
And the credit card and the boot on my car!
You did that, didn't you?

760
00:55:52,852 --> 00:55:56,162
- Is everything all right?
- It's fine. Just a false alarm.

761
00:55:56,252 --> 00:55:58,049
False alarm, my ass!

762
00:55:58,132 --> 00:55:59,929
I'm embarrassed about this, too.

763
00:56:00,012 --> 00:56:01,968
Get the fuck out of my house!

764
00:56:03,052 --> 00:56:05,043
I'm very sorry, Mrs. Carr.

765
00:56:15,612 --> 00:56:17,603
That son of a bitch is crazy.

766
00:56:27,012 --> 00:56:29,048
- Hello?
- Yeah, Roger.

767
00:56:29,132 --> 00:56:31,043
It's Michael. I know it's late.

768
00:56:31,132 --> 00:56:34,807
How do I get a psycho cop off my back?

769
00:56:38,172 --> 00:56:39,969
You're the Michael Carr...

770
00:56:40,052 --> 00:56:43,010
..that I okayed to do
a ride-along with Officer Davis?

771
00:56:43,092 --> 00:56:45,083
Yes, sir. That's right.

772
00:56:45,172 --> 00:56:48,687
The same Michael Carr whose wife called
to commend Officer Davis?

773
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:54,051
The same two people that are now being
terrorized by this out-of-control sicko.

774
00:56:54,132 --> 00:56:55,929
Out-of-control sicko?

775
00:56:56,012 --> 00:56:58,731
Are you sure
there's nothing personal in this?

776
00:56:58,812 --> 00:57:01,372
There's no question that it's personal.

777
00:57:01,452 --> 00:57:04,762
He busts into my bedroom
when I was having sex with my wife.

778
00:57:06,052 --> 00:57:07,849
Yes, well...

779
00:57:07,932 --> 00:57:12,005
Officer Cole's report says
they were responding to an alarm.

780
00:57:12,092 --> 00:57:14,970
That was verified 
by your security company.

781
00:57:15,052 --> 00:57:18,522
Sure. How about the boot
he had put on my car? My credit cards?

782
00:57:18,612 --> 00:57:21,888
What about them?
Do you have proof he did those things?

783
00:57:21,972 --> 00:57:25,089
You're accusing 
a highly-decorated officer.

784
00:57:25,172 --> 00:57:27,481
I don't care how many medals he has.

785
00:57:27,572 --> 00:57:30,689
- I want this taken care of.
- Or else what, Mr. Carr?

786
00:57:30,772 --> 00:57:33,809
You're not giving me anything. 
No evidence.

787
00:57:33,892 --> 00:57:37,202
You don't have any witnesses.
You don't even have a home video.

788
00:57:37,292 --> 00:57:40,250
These days, everybody's
got a goddamn home video.

789
00:57:40,332 --> 00:57:43,051
Fine. You're just going to bury this thing.

790
00:57:43,132 --> 00:57:46,681
Mr. Carr! This is a professional organization.

791
00:57:46,772 --> 00:57:49,730
We're going to do
a professional investigation, OK?

792
00:57:49,812 --> 00:57:52,884
Matt, bring me the complaint forms, will you?

793
00:57:52,972 --> 00:57:57,921
If there's any truth to your allegations,
we'll take care of it, all right?

794
00:57:58,692 --> 00:58:00,171
Thank you.

795
00:58:00,252 --> 00:58:04,962
The department doesn't want an unstable
officer on the street any more than you do.

796
00:58:05,052 --> 00:58:07,646
- Fill this out. Have you got a pen?
- No, sir.

797
00:58:07,732 --> 00:58:09,723
Thank you.

798
00:58:18,652 --> 00:58:21,610
- Roger, how are you doing?
- He's not coming.

799
00:58:21,692 --> 00:58:26,004
Your friend, Officer Davis, called Lurie
and asked him lots of questions.

800
00:58:26,092 --> 00:58:29,448
How well does he know you?
Has he done business with you before?

801
00:58:29,532 --> 00:58:34,083
Lurie's pulling his people out.
He thinks you're under investigation.

802
00:58:34,172 --> 00:58:36,447
This fucker is ruining me.

803
00:58:36,532 --> 00:58:40,207
We can maybe smooth it over,
if we deal with your friend.

804
00:58:40,292 --> 00:58:43,409
I already filed a complaint, Roger.
You told me to do it.

805
00:58:43,492 --> 00:58:46,404
You know what this is?
Some kind of cop scam.

806
00:58:46,492 --> 00:58:49,882
This putz is just supplementing
his lousy income.

807
00:58:49,972 --> 00:58:51,883
Pay him off.

808
00:58:51,972 --> 00:58:56,523
Roger, as my lawyer,
you're advising me to bribe a police officer?

809
00:58:56,612 --> 00:59:00,810
No. I'm advising you to donate to
the son of a bitch's favorite charity.

810
00:59:33,093 --> 00:59:35,084
Thanks for meeting me, Pete.

811
00:59:35,173 --> 00:59:37,164
It gives us

812
00:59:38,453 --> 00:59:40,444
a chance to talk a little bit.

813
00:59:40,533 --> 00:59:43,730
You know, I don't remember
how this all began

814
00:59:43,813 --> 00:59:45,804
or what I did.

815
00:59:46,693 --> 00:59:50,083
But... whatever, I...

816
00:59:50,173 --> 00:59:51,322
I'm sorry.

817
00:59:51,413 --> 00:59:53,404
You know, I...

818
00:59:53,493 --> 00:59:56,405
I'm not looking 
to get you into trouble, Pete.

819
00:59:56,493 --> 00:59:58,802
I certainly don't need any myself.

820
00:59:59,413 --> 01:00:01,404
What do you say?

821
01:00:01,493 --> 01:00:03,484
Water under the bridge?

822
01:00:03,573 --> 01:00:05,962
Hell, we can part friends.

823
01:00:08,733 --> 01:00:11,452
Of course, I'll withdraw the complaint.

824
01:00:19,173 --> 01:00:21,164
OK. Here it is.

825
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:24,484
- What's this?
- $5,000.

826
01:00:24,573 --> 01:00:28,202
You walk away
and don't mess with my investors.

827
01:00:28,893 --> 01:00:30,884
A bribe, Mikey?

828
01:00:30,973 --> 01:00:33,168
Call it whatever you want, Pete.

829
01:00:33,253 --> 01:00:35,244
- I need this deal.
- Sssh.

830
01:00:37,293 --> 01:00:39,523
Do you hear that?

831
01:00:41,973 --> 01:00:43,964
I used to work these hills.

832
01:00:45,853 --> 01:00:47,844
I knew this lady.

833
01:00:47,933 --> 01:00:50,493
She was out walking her little poodle.

834
01:00:52,173 --> 01:00:56,564
A coyote comes charging out,
snatches up the poodle and takes off.

835
01:00:58,253 --> 01:01:03,281
All we ever found of that little doggy
was its diamond-studded leash.

836
01:01:05,173 --> 01:01:08,927
When Karen first met you,
she thought you were different...

837
01:01:09,013 --> 01:01:12,244
- than her gambling father.
- What?

838
01:01:12,333 --> 01:01:14,767
It's interesting 
how people follow patterns.

839
01:01:15,493 --> 01:01:18,610
She doesn't feel safe with you either, Michael.

840
01:01:18,693 --> 01:01:23,050
Karen needs to feel protected
when those coyotes come charging out.

841
01:01:23,133 --> 01:01:25,442
Listen. You stay the fuck away from her...

842
01:01:25,853 --> 01:01:26,842
Ugh!

843
01:01:28,973 --> 01:01:30,964
Assaulting a police officer?

844
01:01:31,133 --> 01:01:33,806
A nice, civilized man like you, Michael?

845
01:01:33,893 --> 01:01:36,851
What are you going to do? Arrest me?

846
01:01:36,933 --> 01:01:38,924
Arrest you?

847
01:01:42,813 --> 01:01:45,247
I could kill you.

848
01:02:22,093 --> 01:02:24,084
What's wrong?

849
01:02:26,693 --> 01:02:28,684
What's going on, Karen?

850
01:02:28,773 --> 01:02:31,162
What the hell are you talking about?

851
01:02:31,253 --> 01:02:34,563
You and Pete. What's going on?

852
01:02:34,653 --> 01:02:37,406
What are you accusing me of?
We had a cup of coffee!

853
01:02:37,493 --> 01:02:39,882
It must have been 
a hot cup of coffee!

854
01:02:39,973 --> 01:02:45,093
He gave a talk to the kids. 
If you think there was anything else, 
you're crazy.

855
01:02:45,173 --> 01:02:47,243
I am? He just put a gun to my head.

856
01:02:47,333 --> 01:02:49,528
What?

857
01:02:49,613 --> 01:02:52,810
He just put a fucking gun to my head.
He wants you.

858
01:02:52,893 --> 01:02:55,009
He thinks you want him.

859
01:02:55,093 --> 01:02:57,732
I swear he didn't get
any of those ideas from me.

860
01:02:57,813 --> 01:03:00,532
He didn't pull them out of the air, Karen.

861
01:03:02,733 --> 01:03:05,850
So, what is it? You get off on leading him on?

862
01:03:06,493 --> 01:03:08,484
Talking to him about us?

863
01:03:09,093 --> 01:03:11,084
About our marriage? Jesus!

864
01:03:12,093 --> 01:03:14,084
I told you he's dangerous.

865
01:03:14,173 --> 01:03:16,641
What's it gonna take? 
Me in a body bag?

866
01:03:20,093 --> 01:03:22,368
I'm sorry.

867
01:03:24,093 --> 01:03:26,084
I'm sorry.

868
01:03:53,213 --> 01:03:54,931
Officer Cole.

869
01:03:55,013 --> 01:03:58,369
Your partner.
I went to him, 
tried to work things out.

870
01:03:58,453 --> 01:04:01,251
Didn't you know enough
to stay away from him?

871
01:04:01,333 --> 01:04:04,484
He's playing you.
Every time you react, it gets worse.

872
01:04:04,573 --> 01:04:07,246
Cops on one side,
everybody else on the other?

873
01:04:07,333 --> 01:04:10,086
Yeah. That's it.

874
01:04:10,173 --> 01:04:12,448
He threatened to kill me last night.

875
01:04:12,533 --> 01:04:14,444
How should I react to that?

876
01:04:17,013 --> 01:04:20,642
If anybody knows this guy is coming apart,
it's got to be you.

877
01:04:20,733 --> 01:04:22,963
Come on, man. The guy's after my wife.

878
01:04:23,053 --> 01:04:25,044
I don't know where else to go.

879
01:04:38,453 --> 01:04:40,842
Come on in.

880
01:04:48,973 --> 01:04:52,488
He doesn't understand.
I'm better for her than he is.

881
01:04:52,573 --> 01:04:56,282
He doesn't love her.
He can't take care of her the way that I can.

882
01:04:56,373 --> 01:04:57,772
She needs it.

883
01:04:57,853 --> 01:05:00,083
What the hell are you going on about?

884
01:05:00,173 --> 01:05:02,084
She's never gonna be yours.

885
01:05:02,173 --> 01:05:04,812
You listen to me. Nothing...

886
01:05:04,893 --> 01:05:08,329
Nothing is ever going to happen
between you and her.

887
01:05:08,413 --> 01:05:10,881
She is some fantasy in your head.

888
01:05:10,973 --> 01:05:13,407
You don't know what 
you're talking about.

889
01:05:13,493 --> 01:05:15,324
- I don't, huh?
- You don't.

890
01:05:15,413 --> 01:05:19,292
You tell me what you were doing
with him the other night.

891
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:22,251
Tell me you didn't 
stick a gun in his face.

892
01:05:22,333 --> 01:05:24,688
I was just playing with him.

893
01:05:24,773 --> 01:05:26,570
I'm not playing with you!

894
01:05:26,653 --> 01:05:28,962
You've got to back off this madness.

895
01:05:29,053 --> 01:05:32,170
You've got to put in
for stress leave and see a doctor

896
01:05:32,253 --> 01:05:33,971
and get your head straight.

897
01:05:35,893 --> 01:05:37,212
Or?

898
01:05:37,293 --> 01:05:42,321
Or I will go upstairs 
and tell them exactly what is 
going on with you.   Understand?

899
01:05:42,413 --> 01:05:44,324
You'd do that?

900
01:05:44,413 --> 01:05:46,085
You're goddamn right.

901
01:05:46,173 --> 01:05:48,767
And if you don't do it 
in the next 24 hours,

902
01:05:48,853 --> 01:05:50,809
that is exactly what I will do.

903
01:05:52,053 --> 01:05:54,044
Now,

904
01:05:54,133 --> 01:05:56,442
you go have coffee with a shrink.

905
01:05:57,173 --> 01:05:59,243
And it will be all right.

906
01:06:00,093 --> 01:06:01,685
You'll see.

907
01:06:39,173 --> 01:06:41,164
Would you look at that?

908
01:06:43,573 --> 01:06:45,564
Hell with it, man. Leave it.

909
01:06:46,893 --> 01:06:48,884
Leon! Freeze!

910
01:07:27,693 --> 01:07:28,523
Shit!

911
01:07:53,093 --> 01:07:54,492
Leon!

912
01:07:59,133 --> 01:08:00,043
Leon!

913
01:08:00,133 --> 01:08:02,124
Open the door!

914
01:08:08,653 --> 01:08:10,644
Put the box down!

915
01:08:10,733 --> 01:08:12,689
- It's finished.
- Put it down!

916
01:08:12,773 --> 01:08:15,606
What the hell are you making us
chase you for? Huh?

917
01:08:15,693 --> 01:08:18,161
Get over there. 
You know the routine.

918
01:08:18,253 --> 01:08:19,811
Spread 'em!

919
01:08:19,893 --> 01:08:21,929
You could be busting real crime.

920
01:08:22,013 --> 01:08:23,810
Yeah, I've got a benny bust.

921
01:08:23,893 --> 01:08:25,884
What have we got here?

922
01:08:26,013 --> 01:08:28,322
I'm providing a service

923
01:08:28,413 --> 01:08:32,008
for those cabbies
who fall asleep behind the wheel.

924
01:08:32,093 --> 01:08:34,163
Hey! That's enough.

925
01:08:40,693 --> 01:08:44,208
I need something more than this.
Come on, Leon!

926
01:08:47,693 --> 01:08:50,890
Look what we got here.
You really are Mr. Clean!

927
01:08:50,973 --> 01:08:53,487
Keep this. 
You might need it later on!

928
01:08:53,573 --> 01:08:56,087
Don't you believe in safe sex?

929
01:08:56,173 --> 01:08:58,892
He's got a gun! 
He's gonna shoot me!

930
01:09:07,653 --> 01:09:09,086
Shit...

931
01:09:09,173 --> 01:09:11,084
What are you doing?

932
01:09:13,533 --> 01:09:15,524
- What? Come on!
- Take the gun.

933
01:09:15,613 --> 01:09:18,047
No, I don't want the gun. 
I don't want the gun!

934
01:09:18,133 --> 01:09:20,203
- Take the gun.
- I don't want it!

935
01:09:20,293 --> 01:09:22,284
Take the gun. Go.

936
01:09:31,533 --> 01:09:33,922
You killed my partner, Leon.

937
01:09:56,213 --> 01:09:59,171
You're not going upstairs 
to talk to anyone.

938
01:10:41,293 --> 01:10:43,284
I went around the back.

939
01:10:46,613 --> 01:10:48,604
Roy...

940
01:10:48,693 --> 01:10:51,002
..followed the suspect in, I guess.

941
01:10:54,293 --> 01:10:56,284
Then I heard shots.

942
01:10:59,893 --> 01:11:01,884
That scumbag shot Roy.

943
01:11:05,493 --> 01:11:07,484
And I guess Roy...

944
01:11:08,333 --> 01:11:11,291
..nailed him before he died.

945
01:11:50,093 --> 01:11:52,084
Wiseman, Acken and Shyer.

946
01:11:52,173 --> 01:11:54,812
This is Michael Carr.
I need to talk with Roger.

947
01:11:54,893 --> 01:11:57,487
He's out of his office. 
Can I take a message?

948
01:11:57,573 --> 01:12:00,565
Page him. Tell him I’m at home.
I'm being set up.

949
01:12:00,653 --> 01:12:03,042
There's cops all over my yard.

950
01:12:03,493 --> 01:12:04,721
Michael!

951
01:12:04,813 --> 01:12:06,724
Tell him to call me immediately.

952
01:12:06,813 --> 01:12:10,567
We have a warrant to search
your dwelling for narcotics.

953
01:12:10,973 --> 01:12:12,964
Please, sir. Step over here.

954
01:12:13,053 --> 01:12:15,328
An informant has 
given us your address

955
01:12:15,413 --> 01:12:18,883
as a residence where he purchased
narcotics from a Michael Carr.

956
01:12:18,973 --> 01:12:21,646
- This is crazy!
- Are you Michael Carr?

957
01:12:21,733 --> 01:12:23,724
Yeah.

958
01:12:49,213 --> 01:12:51,124
Surprise, surprise.

959
01:12:51,213 --> 01:12:55,843
Michael Carr, I’m placing you under arrest
for possession of narcotics.

960
01:12:55,933 --> 01:12:59,687
You have the right to remain silent
and to contact an attorney.

961
01:12:59,773 --> 01:13:01,491
If you cannot afford one...

962
01:13:01,573 --> 01:13:04,451
I'm removing your glasses
for your safety, sir.

963
01:13:04,533 --> 01:13:06,922
We'll take you down to the station now.

964
01:13:07,013 --> 01:13:10,289
We can pull a car up to the back
so your neighbors won't see.

965
01:13:10,373 --> 01:13:12,443
That's very thoughtful of you.

966
01:13:12,533 --> 01:13:16,128
Call Roger. 
Make sure you get hold of Roger.

967
01:13:40,173 --> 01:13:42,368
I'm Detective Noble. How do you do?

968
01:13:42,453 --> 01:13:46,207
I want to offer you the opportunity
to make it easy on yourself.

969
01:13:46,293 --> 01:13:50,081
If you name your connection,
you can be out of here as soon as possible.

970
01:13:50,173 --> 01:13:53,848
I'm not talking to anybody
until I speak with my lawyer.

971
01:13:54,693 --> 01:13:56,684
That's your right, Mr. Carr.

972
01:14:46,493 --> 01:14:48,484
You've got ten minutes.

973
01:15:01,893 --> 01:15:03,884
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

974
01:15:03,973 --> 01:15:05,804
How's Karen?

975
01:15:05,893 --> 01:15:07,770
Hanging in there.

976
01:15:07,853 --> 01:15:09,730
Do I get to see her?

977
01:15:09,813 --> 01:15:13,806
After the arraignment.
You're only allowed legal counsel now.

978
01:15:13,893 --> 01:15:15,485
What about bail?

979
01:15:15,573 --> 01:15:17,723
That will be set at your hearing.

980
01:15:18,293 --> 01:15:20,523
What's your money situation?

981
01:15:20,613 --> 01:15:24,891
Everything I had went into the party
to impress Lurie.

982
01:15:24,973 --> 01:15:26,964
I need to know exactly.

983
01:15:30,933 --> 01:15:32,924
$2,200.

984
01:15:33,693 --> 01:15:39,325
I don't think they'll set bail too high.
It's not like you're a professional dope dealer.

985
01:15:40,653 --> 01:15:42,325
Professional?

986
01:15:43,533 --> 01:15:47,492
There was half a pound of cocaine
in your house. We've got a problem.

987
01:15:47,573 --> 01:15:48,847
My problem's simple.

988
01:15:48,933 --> 01:15:51,606
A cop wants me out of the way
because he wants my wife.

989
01:15:55,333 --> 01:15:57,324
Look. This is way over my head.

990
01:15:58,293 --> 01:16:02,730
I got in touch with Sam Gershon.
He's the best criminal attorney I know.

991
01:16:02,813 --> 01:16:05,088
He'll represent you at your hearing.

992
01:16:05,173 --> 01:16:09,803
You guys need to talk to Roy Cole.
Davis' partner, Officer Roy Cole.

993
01:16:09,893 --> 01:16:14,523
He told me that if anything else happened,
he'd help me out.

994
01:16:15,533 --> 01:16:17,524
Cole's dead.

995
01:16:19,733 --> 01:16:23,487
In the line of duty, in a shoot-out.
I talked to his captain.

996
01:16:29,413 --> 01:16:31,449
He won't stop until he kills me.

997
01:16:31,533 --> 01:16:33,524
Get me out of here, Roger.

998
01:16:33,613 --> 01:16:36,173
I will. It's all in hand.

999
01:16:36,253 --> 01:16:38,687
No, no, no. You listen to me.

1000
01:16:40,093 --> 01:16:42,482
Just get me out of here.

1001
01:16:42,573 --> 01:16:46,486
Case PA846059. People versus Alvarez.

1002
01:16:46,573 --> 01:16:51,089
Mr. Alvarez is charged with
illegal possession of an automatic weapon

1003
01:16:51,173 --> 01:16:54,006
as set forth 
in the California Penal Code.

1004
01:16:54,093 --> 01:16:56,209
Is he represented by counsel?

1005
01:16:56,293 --> 01:16:57,885
He pleads innocent.

1006
01:16:57,973 --> 01:17:01,852
Nothing can be served
by his detention until trial.

1007
01:17:01,933 --> 01:17:07,371
- We request release on OR.
- Denied. Bail set at $25,000.

1008
01:17:07,453 --> 01:17:10,968
Case PA855327.

1009
01:17:11,053 --> 01:17:12,850
People versus Michael Carr.

1010
01:17:12,933 --> 01:17:17,484
Mr. Carr is charged with possession
of cocaine with intent to distribute

1011
01:17:17,573 --> 01:17:23,091
as set forth in section 11351 and 11352
of the California Health and Safety Code.

1012
01:17:24,013 --> 01:17:27,289
- Is he represented by counsel?
- He pleads innocent.

1013
01:17:27,373 --> 01:17:31,048
Your Honor, he is a model citizen
who owns his own home.

1014
01:17:31,133 --> 01:17:33,124
He's in business locally.

1015
01:17:33,213 --> 01:17:37,172
His wife is a teacher
in a respected local private school.

1016
01:17:37,253 --> 01:17:39,323
We request bail on OR.

1017
01:17:39,853 --> 01:17:45,485
Your Honor, it's come to our attention
that Mr. Carr pled out a similar case in Texas.

1018
01:17:53,293 --> 01:17:55,284
What about this?

1019
01:17:55,373 --> 01:17:57,364
It wasn't me.

1020
01:17:57,453 --> 01:17:59,683
I took an investor out on the town.

1021
01:17:59,773 --> 01:18:03,527
The guy had a vial of blow in his pocket
and stuck it under the car seat.

1022
01:18:03,613 --> 01:18:07,447
A lawyer told me the easiest thing
to do was plead it out, so...

1023
01:18:07,533 --> 01:18:09,922
- But it wasn't me.
- It doesn't matter.

1024
01:18:10,013 --> 01:18:12,481
You took the deal, it's on the record.

1025
01:18:14,133 --> 01:18:18,923
This OR is denied. Bail is set at $250,000.

1026
01:18:19,013 --> 01:18:24,167
Case PA861288. People versus Jenkins.

1027
01:18:24,253 --> 01:18:26,642
Mr. Jenkins is charged with felony

1028
01:18:26,733 --> 01:18:30,009
as set forth in section 4873
of the California Penal Code.

1029
01:18:30,093 --> 01:18:33,642
Mr. Jenkins pleads not guilty, 
Your Honor...

1030
01:18:48,493 --> 01:18:50,768
Having trouble making bail, Mike?

1031
01:18:50,853 --> 01:18:52,844
Money's a little tight, huh?

1032
01:18:54,973 --> 01:18:56,964
Karen's really upset.

1033
01:18:57,053 --> 01:19:00,728
You really shouldn't 
have done this to her.

1034
01:19:02,493 --> 01:19:04,484
She's all alone now.

1035
01:19:05,653 --> 01:19:07,644
But don't worry, not for long.

1036
01:19:13,693 --> 01:19:16,890
I want you to know
that she's gonna be taken care of.

1037
01:19:16,973 --> 01:19:18,964
I know what Karen needs.

1038
01:19:20,253 --> 01:19:23,165
And isn't it her happiness 
that we both want?

1039
01:19:23,253 --> 01:19:25,244
Hmm?

1040
01:19:28,733 --> 01:19:31,486
If you could find us,
why don't you look us up?

1041
01:19:31,573 --> 01:19:34,212
I'd love to have you over 
for a barbecue.

1042
01:19:34,293 --> 01:19:36,284
If you go near her,

1043
01:19:38,333 --> 01:19:40,289
I'll kill you.

1044
01:19:44,893 --> 01:19:46,884
So long, Mikey.

1045
01:19:52,013 --> 01:19:54,004
You look good in blue!

1046
01:20:08,493 --> 01:20:11,166
- Hey.
- Hi.

1047
01:20:11,253 --> 01:20:12,925
How are you doing?

1048
01:20:13,013 --> 01:20:15,243
I'm fine. 
I'm just a little tired.

1049
01:20:15,933 --> 01:20:17,412
There you are!

1050
01:20:17,493 --> 01:20:19,484
I thought he might be hungry.

1051
01:20:19,573 --> 01:20:21,609
- Thanks.
- How about you?

1052
01:20:21,693 --> 01:20:24,048
I could use something, yeah.

1053
01:20:24,133 --> 01:20:26,124
Good.

1054
01:20:26,213 --> 01:20:28,090
Penny...

1055
01:20:28,173 --> 01:20:30,164
I'm really glad you're here.

1056
01:20:30,253 --> 01:20:33,370
It's no problem.
I'll stay till Michael gets home.

1057
01:20:33,453 --> 01:20:35,171
It's gonna be a while.

1058
01:20:35,253 --> 01:20:38,723
That's OK. Get some rest.

1059
01:20:39,733 --> 01:20:41,724
Guard!

1060
01:20:41,813 --> 01:20:43,804
Make a telephone call!

1061
01:20:45,893 --> 01:20:47,884
Guard!

1062
01:20:48,493 --> 01:20:51,565
Guard! Thanks, man.
Can I make a telephone call?

1063
01:20:51,653 --> 01:20:54,326
Guard! Make a telephone call?

1064
01:20:54,413 --> 01:20:55,163
Shut up!

1065
01:20:58,733 --> 01:21:01,611
You're just a fat little piggy, 
aren't you?

1066
01:21:10,413 --> 01:21:12,404
There you go.

1067
01:21:14,373 --> 01:21:16,568
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

1068
01:21:16,653 --> 01:21:17,927
Pete?

1069
01:21:18,013 --> 01:21:20,607
Karen's upstairs. 
She's got a headache.

1070
01:21:20,693 --> 01:21:22,684
Oh.

1071
01:21:22,773 --> 01:21:24,889
I've brought some groceries

1072
01:21:24,973 --> 01:21:28,886
in case she didn't have time
after everything that's been going on.

1073
01:21:28,973 --> 01:21:30,611
I'll tell her you came by.

1074
01:21:31,693 --> 01:21:33,843
Why don't I just give them to you?

1075
01:21:33,933 --> 01:21:36,003
I gotta get going to work, so...

1076
01:21:42,013 --> 01:21:44,925
I'm not very popular here, 
am I, Penny?

1077
01:21:46,493 --> 01:21:47,926
All right.

1078
01:21:48,013 --> 01:21:50,243
I'll just leave them here.

1079
01:21:50,333 --> 01:21:52,369
You can get them...

1080
01:21:52,453 --> 01:21:54,444
You can get them later.

1081
01:21:55,093 --> 01:21:56,890
Take care.

1082
01:21:56,973 --> 01:21:59,282
You look great. 
I'll see you later.

1083
01:22:00,093 --> 01:22:02,084
Bye.

1084
01:23:00,173 --> 01:23:02,164
250. That's a hard bullet.

1085
01:23:02,253 --> 01:23:04,323
You're looking at $25K, Mr. Graham.

1086
01:23:04,413 --> 01:23:06,404
Here's the deed to my house.

1087
01:23:08,053 --> 01:23:11,489
This takes care of the bail,
but what about my premium?

1088
01:23:11,573 --> 01:23:14,167
I'm writing you a $25,000. 
personal check.

1089
01:23:14,253 --> 01:23:16,050
That's a nice Rolex.

1090
01:23:16,133 --> 01:23:19,409
Forget the watch. Sam Gershon
said you'd take care of me.

1091
01:23:19,493 --> 01:23:22,769
This should be a cashier's check,
but you're a friend of Sam.

1092
01:23:22,853 --> 01:23:25,162
If the bank says you've got funds, OK.

1093
01:23:27,493 --> 01:23:30,132
Touch-tone phones, you don't have that?

1094
01:24:01,813 --> 01:24:05,203
All right. Can I make that phone call now?
Please?

1095
01:24:05,293 --> 01:24:08,842
It would just take a second.
I'd really appreciate it.

1096
01:24:08,933 --> 01:24:10,924
Talk to you when I can.

1097
01:24:20,973 --> 01:24:23,362
- Operator.
- A collect, from Michael.

1098
01:24:23,453 --> 01:24:24,966
One moment.

1099
01:24:41,053 --> 01:24:44,602
I'm sorry, sir.
The phone must be off the hook.

1100
01:24:44,693 --> 01:24:47,969
Can you cut in or something?
This is an emergency.

1101
01:24:48,053 --> 01:24:49,202
I did that, sir.

1102
01:24:49,293 --> 01:24:52,171
Can you help me?
I won't get to a phone again.

1103
01:24:52,253 --> 01:24:56,166
It's a machine, I can't tell it what to do.
I can report it...

1104
01:24:56,253 --> 01:24:59,325
- Are you sure it's off the hook?
- Yes, sir, it is.

1105
01:25:11,493 --> 01:25:13,802
Penny, it smells so good!

1106
01:25:13,893 --> 01:25:16,043
I didn't know 
cooking was one of your...

1107
01:25:16,573 --> 01:25:18,165
Hi.

1108
01:25:18,253 --> 01:25:20,813
Are you feeling better?

1109
01:25:22,093 --> 01:25:24,084
I got some umm...

1110
01:25:24,173 --> 01:25:27,165
..mushrooms, onions, dried tomatoes,

1111
01:25:27,973 --> 01:25:29,964
parsley.

1112
01:25:30,053 --> 01:25:33,045
- Where's Penny?
- Penny?

1113
01:25:33,133 --> 01:25:35,124
Umm...

1114
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:37,204
I told her to go home.

1115
01:25:38,973 --> 01:25:40,964
She'd just be a third wheel.

1116
01:25:56,093 --> 01:25:59,324
I took the phone off the hook
so you could sleep

1117
01:25:59,413 --> 01:26:01,324
and have no distractions.

1118
01:26:01,413 --> 01:26:03,404
I'm not sleeping now, am I?

1119
01:26:03,493 --> 01:26:05,484
I want you to leave.

1120
01:26:05,573 --> 01:26:07,325
Wait.

1121
01:26:07,413 --> 01:26:09,404
I know I shouldn't be here.

1122
01:26:09,493 --> 01:26:11,643
I know you're upset.

1123
01:26:11,733 --> 01:26:14,042
But let's stop kidding ourselves, Karen.

1124
01:26:14,133 --> 01:26:17,250
We've bent over backwards
to do the right thing.

1125
01:26:17,333 --> 01:26:20,405
You playing the perfect wife,
me the good friend.

1126
01:26:20,493 --> 01:26:23,451
I can't take it anymore, I just can't.

1127
01:26:24,453 --> 01:26:26,489
Now we can stop pretending.

1128
01:26:27,413 --> 01:26:29,404
We can stop pretending now.

1129
01:26:29,493 --> 01:26:31,563
Pete, I’m very tired.

1130
01:26:31,653 --> 01:26:35,248
I... I need some time alone.
I've got to be by myself.

1131
01:26:35,333 --> 01:26:37,324
I know, I know. I understand.

1132
01:26:40,413 --> 01:26:42,165
Come here. Sit down.

1133
01:26:43,453 --> 01:26:45,444
Sit down.

1134
01:26:45,533 --> 01:26:47,524
I know what's scaring you.

1135
01:26:48,693 --> 01:26:50,285
Listen.

1136
01:26:50,373 --> 01:26:52,443
I don't have to be a cop any more.

1137
01:26:54,653 --> 01:26:57,690
OK? I could do something different
with my life.

1138
01:26:58,573 --> 01:27:00,564
Something clean.

1139
01:27:01,773 --> 01:27:04,082
I think that's good.

1140
01:27:04,173 --> 01:27:08,007
No-one should have to live their life
the way you have been.

1141
01:27:08,093 --> 01:27:11,403
You wouldn't have to carry a gun any more.

1142
01:27:14,093 --> 01:27:16,084
Why don't you put it away? Hmm?

1143
01:27:25,333 --> 01:27:27,528
No gun. No badge.

1144
01:27:36,093 --> 01:27:38,482
I'd better go cook.

1145
01:27:42,133 --> 01:27:44,124
- Pete...
- What?

1146
01:27:44,213 --> 01:27:46,204
I forgot about Tiny.

1147
01:27:48,133 --> 01:27:50,124
The cat!

1148
01:27:50,213 --> 01:27:53,011
I don't like leaving him outside at night.

1149
01:27:56,653 --> 01:27:58,405
OK.

1150
01:27:58,493 --> 01:28:00,211
I'll be right back.

1151
01:28:39,293 --> 01:28:41,090
Karen!

1152
01:28:53,333 --> 01:28:54,971
You got him.

1153
01:28:56,453 --> 01:28:58,444
Yeah.

1154
01:29:02,253 --> 01:29:04,244
Hey, Tiny.

1155
01:29:09,013 --> 01:29:11,004
- Are you OK?
- Mm-hm.

1156
01:29:12,293 --> 01:29:13,885
Yeah.

1157
01:29:17,493 --> 01:29:19,484
Are you sure?

1158
01:29:19,573 --> 01:29:21,564
Mm-hm.

1159
01:29:21,933 --> 01:29:24,652
- You're really tense.
- I am a little bit.

1160
01:29:27,093 --> 01:29:29,163
Come here. I know what you need.

1161
01:29:29,253 --> 01:29:31,244
Come here. It's OK, come on.

1162
01:29:48,813 --> 01:29:51,281
- Move over.
- Move over?

1163
01:29:51,373 --> 01:29:52,965
Come on, let's go.

1164
01:29:53,053 --> 01:29:54,771
Go ahead, take my car!

1165
01:29:54,853 --> 01:29:56,969
I already put up my house 
to get you out.

1166
01:29:57,053 --> 01:29:58,452
Put on your seat belt.

1167
01:30:11,813 --> 01:30:14,771
You keep all your tension 
in your shoulders.

1168
01:30:17,093 --> 01:30:19,084
All up here.

1169
01:30:19,173 --> 01:30:21,164
Just relax.

1170
01:30:23,573 --> 01:30:25,564
Just relax.

1171
01:30:27,013 --> 01:30:29,004
Breathe.

1172
01:30:40,453 --> 01:30:43,013
I feel so lucky 
being alone here with you.

1173
01:30:47,213 --> 01:30:50,250
Tell me how much you love me.

1174
01:30:50,333 --> 01:30:53,450
It will never be as much 
as I love you.

1175
01:30:56,213 --> 01:30:58,204
Pete, don't.

1176
01:30:59,093 --> 01:31:01,084
Don't what?

1177
01:31:01,653 --> 01:31:03,644
Don't what?

1178
01:31:03,733 --> 01:31:06,042
I don't feel very pretty right now.

1179
01:31:06,493 --> 01:31:09,326
Karen, you're beautiful.

1180
01:31:10,333 --> 01:31:11,448
No.

1181
01:31:14,333 --> 01:31:16,324
I want to look better.

1182
01:31:18,653 --> 01:31:21,326
I want to put on 
something nice for you,

1183
01:31:21,413 --> 01:31:23,483
something that you'll like.

1184
01:31:31,933 --> 01:31:33,924
I'll call you when I’m ready.

1185
01:31:36,053 --> 01:31:38,044
Don't be long.

1186
01:31:39,613 --> 01:31:40,728
Slow down!

1187
01:31:40,813 --> 01:31:42,929
We won't make it.

1188
01:31:43,013 --> 01:31:45,322
You can't make it! Michael, no!

1189
01:31:46,373 --> 01:31:47,692
Jesus!

1190
01:32:06,893 --> 01:32:08,565
Karen.

1191
01:32:08,653 --> 01:32:11,087
Are you looking for this?

1192
01:32:13,813 --> 01:32:15,804
Yeah, you read my mind.

1193
01:32:15,893 --> 01:32:18,453
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1194
01:32:18,533 --> 01:32:21,809
I hate the damn thing.
I wanted you to get rid of it.

1195
01:32:24,853 --> 01:32:27,208
I thought you were 
gonna get changed.

1196
01:32:50,133 --> 01:32:51,282
Fuck!

1197
01:32:53,613 --> 01:32:55,285
Hang on.

1198
01:33:07,133 --> 01:33:09,124
Don't shoot, I’m a lawyer.

1199
01:35:13,093 --> 01:35:14,685
Get out!

1200
01:35:14,773 --> 01:35:16,365
What are you doing?

1201
01:35:16,453 --> 01:35:19,729
You're a sick fucking 
brutal asshole! Get out!

1202
01:35:20,773 --> 01:35:22,764
You're not gonna to shoot me.

1203
01:35:22,853 --> 01:35:26,368
- I swear I'll kill you.
- You're not gonna kill anyone.

1204
01:35:26,453 --> 01:35:28,648
You know that this is right.

1205
01:35:28,733 --> 01:35:30,405
Get away!

1206
01:35:30,493 --> 01:35:32,211
Now, put the gun down.

1207
01:35:32,293 --> 01:35:35,012
Put the gun down.

1208
01:35:39,693 --> 01:35:42,082
Try it again. Shoot again.

1209
01:35:42,933 --> 01:35:45,766
Do you think I'd give you
a loaded fucking gun! Huh?

1210
01:35:48,133 --> 01:35:50,249
See how things are now, huh?

1211
01:35:50,333 --> 01:35:53,245
You little fucking cock-teaser!
Is that what it is?

1212
01:35:53,333 --> 01:35:54,971
You little cock-teaser!

1213
01:35:55,053 --> 01:35:58,250
You try to fucking shoot me!
You wanna shoot me?

1214
01:35:58,333 --> 01:36:00,324
You know what you are, Karen?

1215
01:36:00,413 --> 01:36:02,404
You're a little fucking whore!

1216
01:36:02,493 --> 01:36:06,691
You're a worthless whore, just like
every fucking whore I've ever met.

1217
01:36:06,813 --> 01:36:11,603
That's exactly what 
I’m going to treat you like.

1218
01:36:12,173 --> 01:36:14,164
Get them fucking open!

1219
01:36:14,253 --> 01:36:17,882
I'm gonna treat you like a whore, Karen!

1220
01:36:56,493 --> 01:36:57,926
Shit!

1221
01:37:01,893 --> 01:37:03,645
No!

1222
01:37:05,333 --> 01:37:06,971
Michael!

1223
01:37:07,053 --> 01:37:09,044
He found your gun.

1224
01:37:12,933 --> 01:37:15,242
I gotta get you out of this house!

1225
01:37:46,533 --> 01:37:48,171
Aaagh!

1226
01:38:11,973 --> 01:38:14,123
- Karen!
- No!

1227
01:38:58,093 --> 01:38:59,492
Hello.

1228
01:39:01,253 --> 01:39:03,244
Yeah, this is Michael Carr.

1229
01:39:03,333 --> 01:39:05,051
Thank you for calling.

1230
01:39:05,133 --> 01:39:08,489
I was swinging a golf club
and it went though the...

1231
01:39:08,573 --> 01:39:11,087
It went through the patio window.

1232
01:39:11,173 --> 01:39:14,370
It's OK. There's glass everywhere, 
but it's OK.

1233
01:39:15,373 --> 01:39:17,409
Yeah, the password's pyramid.

1234
01:39:21,893 --> 01:39:23,485
No.

1235
01:39:23,573 --> 01:39:25,803
No, I did not change the password.

1236
01:39:25,893 --> 01:39:28,123
I did.

1237
01:39:31,453 --> 01:39:33,444
What's the password?

1238
01:39:33,533 --> 01:39:35,524
Figure it out, asshole.

1239
01:39:36,133 --> 01:39:38,124
Seven letters.

1240
01:39:38,213 --> 01:39:40,090
Fuck you!

1241
01:39:43,253 --> 01:39:45,926
This is going to cost you, Michael.

1242
01:39:49,253 --> 01:39:51,244
Come on, get up here.

1243
01:39:53,493 --> 01:39:55,484
Karen!

1244
01:39:56,413 --> 01:39:58,210
Karen! This is the way it is.

1245
01:39:58,293 --> 01:40:01,444
We've got two minutes
to get in my car and get out of here.

1246
01:40:01,533 --> 01:40:05,048
Do you hear?
If you don't open the door, Michael dies.

1247
01:40:05,133 --> 01:40:07,966
- Understand?
- He'll kill you, too. Stay there.

1248
01:40:08,053 --> 01:40:10,328
- Just shut up.
- Don't come out!

1249
01:40:10,413 --> 01:40:14,406
- Karen, don't fuck around.
- He'll shoot me anyway.

1250
01:40:14,493 --> 01:40:18,771
I won't kill him. Open the door
and I'll let Michael live, I swear.

1251
01:40:18,853 --> 01:40:21,162
If you don't, your husband's dead.

1252
01:40:21,253 --> 01:40:23,323
OK, Karen? That's the way it is.

1253
01:40:23,413 --> 01:40:25,210
I'm giving you a count of three.

1254
01:40:25,293 --> 01:40:26,965
One,

1255
01:40:27,053 --> 01:40:29,044
two...

1256
01:40:29,133 --> 01:40:31,283
Pull the trigger, 
you son of a bitch!

1257
01:40:35,813 --> 01:40:36,802
Karen!

1258
01:40:36,893 --> 01:40:39,327
Karen, don't open the fucking door!

1259
01:42:22,973 --> 01:42:24,326
Michael!

1260
01:42:24,413 --> 01:42:26,404
What are you going to do, tough guy?

1261
01:42:26,493 --> 01:42:29,530
Are you going to make a citizen's arrest?

1262
01:42:29,613 --> 01:42:31,604
Arrest you?

1263
01:42:33,813 --> 01:42:34,848
Aaagh!
