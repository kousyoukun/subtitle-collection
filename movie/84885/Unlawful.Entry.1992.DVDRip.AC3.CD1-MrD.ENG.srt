00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:45,279
uh, I went
on a routine call.

668
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:46,350
All right?

669
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:49,352
It was a young kid.
He was high on drugs.

670
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:51,854
He was beating
on his girlfriend.

671
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:54,857
She couldn't have been
more than 1 5, 1 6.

672
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:57,359
Sweet girl--
blond hair, blue eyes,

673
00:34:57,462 --> 00:35:00,363
so I didn't pay her
much attention.

674
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:03,798
I was reading the kid
his rights

675
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:06,301
when she took out a gun

676
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:10,534
and she shot me
right here in the chest.

677
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:13,041
So now I restrain
felons first

678
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:15,009
with whatever it takes--

679
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:18,708
Whatever it takes,
and that's how it was last night.

680
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:21,717
I don't need
another bullet in the chest,

681
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:23,150
and you don't need
a dead husband.

682
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:26,189
I'm very sorry
if Michael's upset.

683
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,690
I was just doing myjob.

684
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:29,987
Pete. Pete, wait.

685
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:32,460
I--I'm...

686
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:37,028
I'm glad you got him.

687
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:41,336
That guy's
not going to forget

688
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:43,999
the night he made the mistake
ofbreaking in here.

689
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:45,336
That's for sure.

690
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:48,378
O.K. Enjoyyour swim.

691
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,438
This is the chromalite,

692
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:18,941
and it serves
as the backdrop

693
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:21,443
for the dance floor area here.

694
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:24,447
With this chromalite,
we can create any environment.

695
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:25,948
We've got cityscape here,

696
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:29,110
but this could be a desert
or mountain. Anything.

Yeow!

699
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:38,727
I didn't know Michael had
so many good-looking friends.

700
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:40,228
Are you kidding?

701
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:43,232
We don't know
any ofthese people.

702
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:44,733
They're all
potential investors

703

or friends
of Michael's lawyer.

704
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:49,099
That's too bad.

705
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,006
Oh, now, there's one
I'd like to meet.

706
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:57,346
That's the guy I was
telling you about.

707
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:58,346
Your cop?

708
00:36:58,449 --> 00:36:59,347
Mmm.

709
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,348
Really?

Candace. Mywife.

713
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:16,965
Roger, I got a question
onlyyou can answer.

714
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,798
I got an I RS auditor
and a lawyer--

Another lawyerjoke.

Divorce lawyer--jump off

- Who cares?

Hi. Howyou doing, Mike?

Roger Graham.

729
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:43,323
Mike's been talking to me

730
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,327
about security
for the club.

731
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,829
Areyou working
the area tonight?

732
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:51,333
No. I did the precheck
ofthe exterior.

733
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:55,633
I know it's normal to have
your entrance under the marquee,

734
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,140
but it's too open.
It's hard to control.

735
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:01,143
Be better to put
the entrance in the alley.

736
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:03,110
Make people line up
and file in.

737

Ifthings get crazy
and we have to get heavy,

738
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:09,413
only a few people
will see it.

739
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,987
Something to think about.

Why don'tyou get
yourselfa drink?

741
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:17,185
I'll be with you
in a minute.

742
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:21,197
Yeah. Good idea.
I knowyou have business to discuss.

743
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,028
I'll fill you in later.
Take care.

Yeah.

746
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:28,236
You guys aren't bullshitting.

No. I take security
very seriously.

748
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:33,275
Yeah. We're really on top ofit.

749
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:36,045
Hi, there.

750
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,047
Oh, Penny.
This is Pete.

751
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,047

752
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,050
Hi, Penny.
Nice meeting you.

753
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,449
Hi. Nice meeting you.

would be so impressed

a real policeman.

They love cops.

They'reyoung.
Give them time.

760
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:57,291
Maybeyou'd like to come and
give them a talk sometime.

761
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:59,096
Um...

762
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:00,261
Yeah. Sure.

763
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:02,703
Public relations
loves stufflike that.

764
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:06,243
Well, speaking ofpublic relations,
doyou dance?

765
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,608
Honey, can you rescue Roger--
Help me out?

766
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:09,645
Hey, Penny.

767
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:12,011
Come on, Pete,
let's get that drink.

768
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:16,352
Here's toyour club, Mike.

769
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:20,288
Pete, uh, I want to get
something straight here.

770
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:21,790
I'd likeyou to leave.

771
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:23,792
Michael,
what's with you tonight?

772
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:26,761
Why did you even
invite me here?

773
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:29,765
Oh, no. Telling you
and inviting you

774
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,767
are two completely
different things.

775
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,268
You seem so uptight.

776
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,807
Relax. Is it because
you were up late last night?

777
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:38,306
How doyou know?

778
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:41,310
I was driving
byyour house on patrol.

779
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:44,313
I sawyour lights on
till well after 3:00.

780
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:48,317
You don't have to protect us
anymore. You caught him.

781
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:49,579
You think that's it?

782
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:51,587
You're not
a virgin anymore.

783
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:54,590
You saw how much
evil shit's out there.

784
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:58,753
What kind offriend wouldn't try
to protectyou and Karen?

785
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:01,764
You listen to me
'cause I'm telling you--

786
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:02,958
You leave us alone.

787
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,467
You know, I think
I understand

788
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,469
where this is coming from.

789
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:08,970
Oh, doyou?

790
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,439
Yeah.Just cut the shit, O.K.?

791
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:13,942
Nobody expects you to be me.

792
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:17,343
I make my living going up
against guys like Pike.

793
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:20,474
You don't. You've got nothing
to be ashamed of.

794
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,984
Is that whatyou think
this is about?

795
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,349
Yeah, I do.

796
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:29,358
I betyou had one hell ofa night
when you got home.

797
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,860
A friend would be
thanking me.

798
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:34,863
I'm notyourfriend.
I'm nothing toyou.

799
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:36,364

Honey, please don't
keep them waiting.

807
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:52,642
Ifl have to.

808
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:56,151
Tell Roger I'll be there
in a second, O.K.?

 Everybody's free

 To feel good

812
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:04,918
What are you going to do?

813
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:08,157
You going to call the cops?

814
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:10,324

Your pigeon's watching.

Hope he doesn't
fly away on you.

820
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,436
Hey, need your car, man?

821

Ticket.

Don'tyou think
you were rough on Pete?

823
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:09,324
I told you I don't
want him around.

824
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:11,326
I wanted to make that clear.

825
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:12,827
Well, you succeeded.

826
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,262
Come on, guys,
it's time for our toast.

827
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,264

Uh, good health,

829
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:26,341
good fortune,

830
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:28,343
and the time
to enjoy it.

831
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:30,379
That's an old
Castilian toast.

832
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:31,413
Translated.

833
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:32,914
[Candace]
Honey, looks like

834
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:35,508
you've just made
these two people very happy.

835
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:37,519
[Roger]
Candace, I know three people

836
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:39,486
your husband's
made happy tonight.

837
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:43,492
We'll all be happywhen
everything falls into place, Roger.

838
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:45,994
What's not to fall into place?

839
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:48,860
That is a nice ride, dude.

840
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:51,366
[Michael]
I thoughtyou were about to propose

841
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:54,369
another one ofthose wonderful
continental toasts.

842
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:56,871
[Jerry]
To the two most
charming women here--

843
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:58,874
Your beautiful wife
and mine.

844
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:00,375
[Tires Squeal]

845
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:36,880
Ohh...

846
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:41,415
Ohh...

847
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:44,648
Mmm...

848
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:46,052
Mmm...

849
00:44:04,908 --> 00:44:08,503
I'm glad you called.

850
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:11,513
I been thinking
aboutyou a lot lately.

851
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:22,990
Leave it.

852
00:44:24,928 --> 00:44:25,952
Sorry.

853
00:44:27,097 --> 00:44:29,292
Still sensitive, huh?

854
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:34,370
You get shot
or something?

855
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:40,307
Itwas a fishing accident.

856
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:42,843
Yeah.

857
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:45,437
Who fishes with guns?

858
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:54,355
Areyou all right?

859
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:58,894
'Causewe can go
to a motel

860
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:00,896
on a nice, cozy bed.

861
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:03,831
I mean, ifyou're having
a problem...

862
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:05,902
A problem?

863
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:20,611
The only problem
that I have...

864
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:26,321
is sleazy,
lowlife whores likeyou.

865
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:29,085
That's my problem.

866
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:32,424
What the hell's
wrong with you?

867
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:33,427
Get out.

868
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:35,020
I'm not getting out here!

869
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:36,497
Just get the fuck out!

870
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,467
Areyou crazy?
I don't know where the fuck I am.

871
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,505
That's exactly
your fucking problem, isn't it?

872
00:45:42,606 --> 00:45:44,005
Isn't it?

873
00:45:56,954 --> 00:45:57,087
So, being a policeman

874
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,349
So, being a policeman

875
00:45:58,455 --> 00:46:02,824
is really
all about helping people.

876
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,826
It's about
being a friend.

877
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:07,795
It's not about shooting
it outwith bad guys.

878
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:10,298
That's what
you see on TV.

879
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,801
That's not why
I wanted to become a cop.

880
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:16,304
I became a cop
to protect people--

881
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:19,307
To make them
feel happy and safe.

882
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:20,808
Everybody understand that?

883
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:21,809
Yes.

884
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:23,812
Does anybody have
any questions?

885
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:24,812
What?

886
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:26,906
Do you wear
bulletproofvests?

887
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:30,145
Uh-huh. Have to
to protect myself.

888
00:46:30,254 --> 00:46:31,152
Who else?

889
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:32,654
In the police car,

890
00:46:32,756 --> 00:46:34,656
areyou always
with somebody?

891
00:46:34,758 --> 00:46:38,660
Mm-hmm. I have a partner
named Officer Roy Cole.

892
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:42,823
We've worked together
for the past 7, 8 years.

893
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:44,332
He's a very good friend.

894
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:45,401
O.K. You.

895
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:48,164
Can you show me how
to use your handcuffs?

896
00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:49,671
Ha ha ha.

897
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:51,172
Sure. Come here.

898
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:52,674
What's your name?

899
00:46:52,776 --> 00:46:53,674
Matthew.

900
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:55,506
Matthew?
All right, Matthew,

901
00:46:55,612 --> 00:46:57,341
put your hands out.

902
00:46:57,447 --> 00:47:01,349
Think I could get him
to use those on me?

903
00:47:01,451 --> 00:47:02,782
Thereyou go.

904
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:04,786
You're under arrest,
Matthew.

905
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:12,294
Hi. I couldn't take off
without saying thanks

906
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:14,796
for letting me
impress the kids.

907
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:17,298
That was really
a lot offun.

908
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:19,301
Penny really set it up.

909
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:21,234
Yeah. I talked
to Penny before.

910
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:24,136
I'd like to apologize
for the other night.

911
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:25,139
Michael's behavior,

912
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:27,802
that kind oftook me
by surprise.

913
00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:30,072
I would've
never shown up.

914
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,580
Pete, it's notyou.
It's him.

915
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:35,083
He's just not
been himselflately.

916
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:39,087
Would you like to go
get a cup of coffee?

917
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:42,090
I--I don't go on
for a while.

918
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:45,093
That's not a good idea.

919
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:47,663
You're safe with me.
I'm a cop.

920
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:49,664
Just for a little while?

921
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:51,233
Yeah.Just...

922
00:47:58,442 --> 00:48:00,842
Is everybody in here a cop?

923
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:02,275
Yeah, pretty much.

924
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:05,280
About a year ago,
some jerk came in here

925
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:08,283
and tried to rip
this place off.

926
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,285
He didn't do too well.

927
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:13,288
When he come crashing
through the skylight,

928
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,290
I say, " How's your dick?"

929
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:17,792
I'm sorry. We should go
somewhere else.

930
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:19,294
No. This is great.

931
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:20,294
Really?

932
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:21,455
Yeah.

933
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:24,796
I think it's really nice
you got a place to go.

934
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,301
I'd like one.

935
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,303
Just--this is...

936
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:31,841
this is my least favorite
time ofthe day.

937
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:32,874
Why?

938
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:34,444
Uh...well, 'cause
it's getting dark out

939
00:48:34,444 --> 00:48:35,843
Uh...well, 'cause
it's getting dark out

940
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:37,675
and Michael's
not homeyet.

941
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:41,778
How'd you and Michael
get together?

942
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,787
I was a waitress
at his first club.

943
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:50,053
Really? You were a waitress?

944
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,061
It was the first job
I ever had--

945
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:54,494
The first one I needed.

946
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:56,828
We were
kind ofwell-off.

947
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:59,334
My father,
as it turned out,

948
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:02,496
had sort of a gambling
problem, so...

949
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:05,268
You know, then people
started coming over

950
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:09,004
and taking our cars
in the middle ofthe night.

951
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:12,013
It--it was
kind ofa scary time.

952
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,948
And Michael tookyou
away from all that?

953
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:17,418
Things always came
really easilyto Michael.

954
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:19,921
Is thatwhy
you married him?

955
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:26,727
I married him because
I fell in lovewith him.

956
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:30,297
Hmmph.

957
00:49:32,169 --> 00:49:34,660
This is, uh...

958
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:40,809
I hardly knowyou,
and I'm talking like this.

959
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:44,813
Karen, all the things that come
so easilyto Michael--

960
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:46,815
Wereyou one ofthem?

961
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:51,013
'Cause there's no man that deserves
that much good fortune.

962
00:49:51,121 --> 00:49:52,816
I mean that.

963
00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:56,825
A woman likeyou a man
should never take for granted,

964
00:49:56,927 --> 00:50:00,693
and you should
never feel unsafe.

965
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:03,322
And I wantyou to know

966
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:05,833
that ifyou ever
need anything--

967
00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:08,336
You're feeling bad
in anyway

968
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:10,838
oryou just need to talk--

969
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:12,841
That I'm there foryou, O.K.?

970
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:15,844
As a friend...
as a real friend,

971
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:17,504
I'm there foryou.

972
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:21,508
O.K.?

973
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:28,356
Come on. Let me
get you out ofhere.

974
00:51:10,934 --> 00:51:12,834
How was your afternoon?

975
00:51:12,936 --> 00:51:14,335
Hey. Good.

976
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:16,338
It was fine.

977
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,466
You and Mrs. Carr
getting along O.K.?

978
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:29,316
We seem to be.

979
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:38,091
When I was a kid
at Erasmus,

980
00:51:38,195 --> 00:51:41,858
I didn't have a single teacher
that looked like Karen.

981
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:44,866
I mean,
they all had blue hair

982
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:47,368
with names like Mushbutt
orSilvercrone.

983
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:49,905
Silvercrone's my maiden name.

984
00:51:52,976 --> 00:51:54,876
She had me.

985
00:51:54,978 --> 00:51:56,377
Thankyou.

986
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,879
The good news is

987
00:51:57,981 --> 00:52:00,381
FrankTaft
was so take with you,

988
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:03,817
he's considering kicking in
halfthe capital himself.

989
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,319
FrankTaft?
Booyoo Records?

990
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:06,821
Yeah.

I'm sorry.

Doyou have
another card?

00:52:15,932 --> 00:52:17,160
What's the problem?

997
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:18,165
It's canceled.

00:52:18,268 --> 00:52:19,496

Michael, what's that?

1008
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,853
Looks likeyou're having
a bad night, Michael.

1009
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:46,360
Look, all I know

1010
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:48,761
is what's on the
computer print-out,

1011
00:52:48,865 --> 00:52:51,561
and the computer says
you got parking tickets.

1012
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:53,067
And the computer is wrong,

1013
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:57,072
so I'm not paying 600 bucks
for tickets I didn't get.

to the Minzers' house?

watching a man
attack mywife
