1
00:03:07,492 --> 00:03:10,131
You once said, aboutyour childhood,

2
00:03:10,212 --> 00:03:12,362
"l grew up with seriousness

3
00:03:12,452 --> 00:03:14,443
all aroundme."

4
00:03:14,532 --> 00:03:17,285
Yeah, myparents were very, verystrict.

5
00:03:17,372 --> 00:03:19,442
I come from a Catholic family.

6
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,807
There are five kids in ourfamily.

7
00:03:21,892 --> 00:03:25,248
We weren'tpoor,
but we were lowermiddle class.

8
00:03:25,332 --> 00:03:27,402
We didn'thave a lot ofmoney.

9
00:03:27,492 --> 00:03:29,642
My dad's theory was keep working,

10
00:03:29,732 --> 00:03:31,723
work hard, work hard.

11
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:33,803
And er, prettymuch no play.

12
00:03:33,892 --> 00:03:37,282
It was almostlike notgoodin ourfamily

13
00:03:37,372 --> 00:03:40,887
ifyou laughed
or ifyou wanted to have a lot offun.

14
00:03:40,972 --> 00:03:43,361
So, thatstays with you a little bit

15
00:03:45,012 --> 00:03:48,687
I think ithelpedmy tennis,
because l did work hard.

16
00:03:50,092 --> 00:03:54,210
But l think it's important
to have a balance in life...

17
00:04:00,172 --> 00:04:04,324
He thinks l put up $100,000 of my money
just to watch it disappear?

18
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:08,724
- He doesn't care aboutyourmoney!
- He doesn't have to. I just want to know!

19
00:04:08,812 --> 00:04:11,804
To the people he represents,
it's pocket change.

20
00:04:11,892 --> 00:04:14,645
Does he know
what this will do to me and Karen?

21
00:04:14,732 --> 00:04:18,008
- Iknowyou're out there
- Yeah, but does he know?

22
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,810
Michael...

23
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:24,841
Listen, Roger, it sounds good.
Fax it to me, l'll talk to you in the morning.

24
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:27,400
Sorry, l tried to keep it quiet.

25
00:04:27,492 --> 00:04:30,848
I heard a noise from downstairs.
Didn't you hear it?

26
00:04:30,932 --> 00:04:33,571
No, l was cracking on the phone with Roger.

27
00:04:33,652 --> 00:04:37,884
It's probably the wind... or fuzz-face here.
Why does he hate me?

28
00:04:37,972 --> 00:04:40,964
If you paid him more attention,
he'd like you better.

29
00:04:41,052 --> 00:04:43,771
He would if l fed him goodies, like you do.

30
00:04:43,852 --> 00:04:45,808
I think you're jealous of Tiny.

31
00:04:45,892 --> 00:04:48,360
He gets to sleep with you more than l do.

32
00:04:50,892 --> 00:04:53,725
Is that...? l'll go down.

33
00:04:53,812 --> 00:04:55,962
Maybe we should call the police.

34
00:04:56,092 --> 00:04:58,367
No, it's OK. I'll just check it out.

35
00:05:05,212 --> 00:05:09,171
Don't worry. If it's anything serious,
l'll come back for my driver.

36
00:07:22,092 --> 00:07:24,003
Michael, is everything all right?

37
00:07:24,092 --> 00:07:27,323
- Somebody's in the house. Call the police.
- What?

38
00:07:27,412 --> 00:07:29,403
Michael!

39
00:07:36,612 --> 00:07:38,603
No!

40
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,282
Stop, motherfucker! Back off!

41
00:07:45,492 --> 00:07:46,686
Back off!

42
00:07:46,772 --> 00:07:48,763
- Back off!
- OK.

43
00:07:49,572 --> 00:07:52,211
Drop it. Drop it! Drop it!

44
00:07:53,292 --> 00:07:54,884
Take anything you want!

45
00:07:54,972 --> 00:07:57,566
- Here, you can have my watch!
- I don't want no watch!

46
00:07:57,652 --> 00:07:59,643
Please don't hurt her.

47
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,531
I'll give you anything you want, please.

48
00:08:35,292 --> 00:08:36,486
Karen!

49
00:08:57,972 --> 00:09:00,611
..outside of6th at 718.

50
00:09:11,892 --> 00:09:13,530
Police, sir.

51
00:09:17,092 --> 00:09:18,889
Hi, come on in, guys.

52
00:09:18,972 --> 00:09:21,645
I'm Officer Cole. My partner, Officer Davis.

53
00:09:21,732 --> 00:09:22,687
Michael Carr.

54
00:09:22,772 --> 00:09:25,047
What happened to your foot, Mr Carr?

55
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:27,566
I knocked a beer bottle down in the kitchen.

56
00:09:27,652 --> 00:09:29,643
It's nothing really.

57
00:09:29,732 --> 00:09:32,200
Mr Carr, can you tell us what happened?

58
00:09:32,292 --> 00:09:35,841
Yeah. We were upstairs in my office,
my wife and l,

59
00:09:35,932 --> 00:09:37,923
and we heard a noise.

60
00:09:38,012 --> 00:09:40,731
This is my wife, Karen.

61
00:09:40,812 --> 00:09:42,609
Thank you for coming so quickly.

62
00:09:42,692 --> 00:09:46,241
Can you tell us what happened
after you heard the noise?

63
00:09:46,332 --> 00:09:48,323
Michael went down and l,

64
00:09:48,412 --> 00:09:50,403
I heard another noise

65
00:09:50,492 --> 00:09:52,483
and l went down... and...

66
00:09:55,372 --> 00:09:57,932
It's OK, Mrs Carr. Just take your time.

67
00:09:58,012 --> 00:10:00,401
This man jumped out ofthe closet

68
00:10:00,492 --> 00:10:02,687
and he and Michael fought.

69
00:10:02,772 --> 00:10:05,002
It wasn't much of a fight, really.

70
00:10:05,092 --> 00:10:07,970
I grabbed his leg, he was trying to get away.

71
00:10:08,052 --> 00:10:10,566
He got out in the kitchen, got hold of Karen

72
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:12,802
and took off out through the back.

73
00:10:12,892 --> 00:10:15,122
The son of a bitch put a knife to her throat.

74
00:10:15,212 --> 00:10:17,282
- Are you OK?
- Yes, l am.

75
00:10:17,372 --> 00:10:18,885
- Do you need a doctor?
- No.

76
00:10:18,972 --> 00:10:20,485
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, thank you.

77
00:10:21,852 --> 00:10:23,046
Tiny!

78
00:10:23,572 --> 00:10:24,891
Tiny?

79
00:10:26,132 --> 00:10:27,690
Come here, Tiny.

80
00:10:27,772 --> 00:10:30,809
You're not a very good watchcat,
are you, Tiny?

81
00:10:30,892 --> 00:10:31,881
Useless.

82
00:10:31,972 --> 00:10:35,487
I guess he likes policemen.

83
00:10:39,532 --> 00:10:43,047
We'll have someone over in the morning
to dust for prints.

84
00:10:43,132 --> 00:10:45,123
Try and not disturb too much.

85
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:49,171
We've had a bunch of break-ins here.
We think it's the same guy.

86
00:10:49,252 --> 00:10:52,562
- In this street?
- This general area, but we'll get him.

87
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:56,327
- I wouldn't mind seeing that.
- Does anyone want any coffee?

88
00:10:56,412 --> 00:10:58,403
Yes. I never turn down coffee.

89
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:00,528
Whoa, watch the glass.

90
00:11:00,612 --> 00:11:02,489
Oh.

91
00:11:02,572 --> 00:11:04,051
Excuse me.

92
00:11:04,132 --> 00:11:05,281
Thanks.

93
00:11:05,372 --> 00:11:09,160
This guy who's doing this,
is there any chance he'll come back?

94
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:12,050
We were told this was a safe neighbourhood.

95
00:11:12,132 --> 00:11:15,522
All things considered,
this is a safe neighbourhood.

96
00:11:15,612 --> 00:11:18,968
Mr Carr probably scared him so much,
he won't come back.

97
00:11:19,052 --> 00:11:21,327
It doesn't matter. I'm getting a gun.

98
00:11:21,412 --> 00:11:23,004
- What?
- I'm getting a gun.

99
00:11:23,092 --> 00:11:25,322
- No guns.
- Maybe she'll listen to you guys.

100
00:11:25,412 --> 00:11:27,528
Don't get a gun.

101
00:11:27,612 --> 00:11:29,762
It's easy for you to say, you've got one.

102
00:11:29,852 --> 00:11:32,286
- I'm trained to use it.
- I've done some shooting.

103
00:11:32,372 --> 00:11:34,761
At targets... Not people.

104
00:11:34,852 --> 00:11:37,650
Take our advice. Get an alarm, get a dog,

105
00:11:37,732 --> 00:11:39,404
but forget about guns.

106
00:11:39,492 --> 00:11:41,528
The wrong people always get hurt.

107
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:48,283
Nice people.

108
00:11:48,372 --> 00:11:50,602
Hey. I know what you're thinking.

109
00:11:51,612 --> 00:11:53,648
What am l thinking, Roy?

110
00:12:02,892 --> 00:12:05,452
I'm never gonna be able to sleep.

111
00:12:05,532 --> 00:12:07,568
Me neither.

112
00:12:12,572 --> 00:12:14,005
I thought he...

113
00:12:16,092 --> 00:12:18,083
When he grabbed me...

114
00:12:22,092 --> 00:12:24,083
It's all right.

115
00:12:24,172 --> 00:12:27,084
I don't think l can stay here, it's just so weird.

116
00:12:27,172 --> 00:12:30,528
We'll get some things together
and go to a hotel, OK?

117
00:12:30,612 --> 00:12:33,331
No. I don't think l can live here any more.

118
00:12:33,892 --> 00:12:35,928
I think we should sell the house.

119
00:12:36,012 --> 00:12:38,810
Honey, wait a minute. You love this house.

120
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:42,123
I know, but we really don't need this now.

121
00:12:42,212 --> 00:12:43,850
We're in way over our heads.

122
00:12:43,932 --> 00:12:46,810
- We can barely afford it.
- Don't get carried away.

123
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:49,565
You know what we're gonna do? We're just...

124
00:12:49,652 --> 00:12:51,882
We're gonna take that cop's advice.

125
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:55,328
Tomorrow morning, l'll make a few calls.
Come here.

126
00:12:55,412 --> 00:12:58,609
We'll get the best security system
known to man.

127
00:12:59,532 --> 00:13:01,523
If that doesn't do it,

128
00:13:01,892 --> 00:13:04,042
we'll get a... killer watchdog.

129
00:13:04,132 --> 00:13:08,284
A vicious... pit bull with fangs

130
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:10,363
with a stud collar.

131
00:13:11,372 --> 00:13:13,090
Come on, honey.

132
00:13:13,172 --> 00:13:15,163
We'll be all right.

133
00:13:17,092 --> 00:13:19,083
Come on.

134
00:13:19,892 --> 00:13:22,611
You chased him around with a putter?

135
00:13:22,692 --> 00:13:26,287
- You're a hero!
- Dirty Harry and Arnold Palmer all in one.

136
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:29,967
It sounds pretty intense.
I'd have had a heart attack.

137
00:13:30,052 --> 00:13:32,043
You did OK. Are you guys all right?

138
00:13:32,132 --> 00:13:34,123
Yeah. Well, Karen's upset.

139
00:13:34,212 --> 00:13:36,203
Shit. Here he comes.

140
00:13:37,492 --> 00:13:39,483
Do we have to kiss him?

141
00:13:47,332 --> 00:13:49,129
Gentlemen.

142
00:13:49,892 --> 00:13:53,168
I read your prospectus.
Demographics look good.

143
00:13:53,252 --> 00:13:56,369
Jerry, l'm not a big believer in demographics.

144
00:13:56,452 --> 00:14:00,047
- I think it's a lawyer's tool, no offence.
- None taken.

145
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:03,442
- Amazing place.
- The potential here is fantastic.

146
00:14:03,532 --> 00:14:08,208
I learnt to go with my instincts.
I used demographics once and went belly up.

147
00:14:08,292 --> 00:14:11,011
- Was that Denver?
- He's done his homework!

148
00:14:11,092 --> 00:14:14,368
You weren't the only one.
I put a lot of my clients' money there.

149
00:14:14,452 --> 00:14:16,363
Those buildings are still empty.

150
00:14:16,452 --> 00:14:18,170
That won't happen down here.

151
00:14:18,252 --> 00:14:21,449
This downtown area
has undergone a revitalisation.

152
00:14:21,532 --> 00:14:24,569
The new buildings are all filled with people,

153
00:14:24,652 --> 00:14:28,088
all within shouting distance
of this place here.

154
00:14:28,172 --> 00:14:32,848
OK. I want to put on a backers' party
so you can get a feel for what could go on.

155
00:14:35,492 --> 00:14:36,720
It's mine.

156
00:14:38,052 --> 00:14:41,647
- Hello.
- Hi, it's me. Bad timing?

157
00:14:41,732 --> 00:14:44,326
We're in the middle of it, but we're close.

158
00:14:44,412 --> 00:14:46,084
What's going on?

159
00:14:46,172 --> 00:14:48,811
The security people haven't shown up yet.

160
00:14:48,892 --> 00:14:51,611
Neither have the police to dust for prints.

161
00:14:51,692 --> 00:14:54,490
- Didyou call them?
- Yeah. I get a run-around.

162
00:14:54,572 --> 00:14:57,689
Great. OK, l tellyou what.
Here's whatyou do.

163
00:14:58,252 --> 00:15:03,451
Call the police and ask to talk to those
two cops from last night. I bet they can help.

164
00:15:03,532 --> 00:15:04,965
Well, OK. I'll try.

165
00:15:05,052 --> 00:15:07,612
I'll be home as soon as l can. You all right?

166
00:15:07,692 --> 00:15:09,683
Mm-hm. I love you.

167
00:15:09,772 --> 00:15:11,763
- Ilike that!
- Bye.

168
00:15:14,292 --> 00:15:16,522
Michael, l'm being grilled here!

169
00:15:16,612 --> 00:15:19,968
This area's high crime, right?
You get the people in.

170
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:22,088
How do you keep the bad element out?

171
00:15:23,132 --> 00:15:26,363
I'm into that as we speak.
I'm working on security now.

172
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,761
Michael, you remember Officer Davis?

173
00:15:54,852 --> 00:15:58,640
Oh, yeah! How are you doing?
l didn't recognise you out of uniform.

174
00:15:58,732 --> 00:16:01,485
- You did all this?
- Yeah, it's no big deal.

175
00:16:01,572 --> 00:16:05,281
- It is! We really appreciate it.
- It's the least l could do.

176
00:16:05,372 --> 00:16:07,283
Mrs Carr called my captain

177
00:16:07,372 --> 00:16:11,365
and said all kinds of nice things
about me and my partner, Roy.

178
00:16:11,452 --> 00:16:14,569
- It was nice, l appreciate it.
- Can l get you a beer?

179
00:16:14,652 --> 00:16:16,961
Sure, that would be great. Thanks.

180
00:16:19,852 --> 00:16:23,208
There will be contact switches
on every point of entrance.

181
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:27,126
A breeze won't be able
to get in this house without you knowing!

182
00:16:27,212 --> 00:16:30,045
Here, there will be
an infrared motion detector.

183
00:16:30,132 --> 00:16:33,329
This will detect if anybody breaks the glass.

184
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:36,490
Hey! What's he doing in the bathroom here?

185
00:16:36,572 --> 00:16:38,563
Oh.

186
00:16:39,492 --> 00:16:42,484
It's just an extra precaution, it's a safe room.

187
00:16:44,652 --> 00:16:48,406
These old houses have doors like solid rock.

188
00:16:48,492 --> 00:16:51,325
We put a heavy dead bolt
on each entrance here.

189
00:16:51,412 --> 00:16:56,440
If there's an intruder, just lock yourself in
and wait for the cavalry,

190
00:16:56,532 --> 00:16:57,567
which is us.

191
00:17:01,292 --> 00:17:04,568
Pick out a codeword.
It's got to be seven letters.

192
00:17:10,252 --> 00:17:11,844
Pyramid.

193
00:17:11,932 --> 00:17:13,365
Pyramid?

194
00:17:15,892 --> 00:17:17,848
This is the Michael Carr residence.

195
00:17:17,932 --> 00:17:20,162
The codeword's gonna be pyramid.

196
00:17:21,492 --> 00:17:23,483
Right. OK. Thank you.

197
00:17:24,012 --> 00:17:25,809
That's it.

198
00:17:26,892 --> 00:17:29,087
Oh, yeah.

199
00:17:29,172 --> 00:17:31,686
- 440 cubes, 500 horses.
- Jesus!

200
00:17:31,772 --> 00:17:34,844
- Did you do the work yourself?
- Every nut and bolt.

201
00:17:34,932 --> 00:17:37,321
Installed the alarm. It relaxes me.

202
00:17:37,412 --> 00:17:41,007
- That is nice. Really nice.
- Thanks.

203
00:17:43,172 --> 00:17:46,608
Oh, man!
You've got a knack for this security stuff!

204
00:17:46,692 --> 00:17:49,809
Do you ever think about
consulting as a sideline?

205
00:17:49,892 --> 00:17:53,282
- Consulting?
- Yeah. Homes, businesses.

206
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,932
I got a club l'm putting together downtown.

207
00:17:56,012 --> 00:17:58,162
What you're doing today,
but you get paid for your time.

208
00:17:58,252 --> 00:18:00,163
I never really thought about it much.

209
00:18:00,252 --> 00:18:03,085
- You're staying for dinner, right?
- Yeah.

210
00:18:03,172 --> 00:18:05,128
- No.
- Are you doing anything?

211
00:18:05,212 --> 00:18:07,203
I'd be crossing the line.

212
00:18:07,292 --> 00:18:10,489
Cops on one side,
everybody else on the other.

213
00:18:11,492 --> 00:18:13,483
Come on!

214
00:18:17,332 --> 00:18:20,608
This has really been nice.

215
00:18:20,692 --> 00:18:24,970
Usually dinner for me is a bunch of us
telling boring war stories.

216
00:18:25,052 --> 00:18:28,124
Cops stick together
because nobody else could stand us!

217
00:18:28,212 --> 00:18:30,282
- You've never been married?
- No.

218
00:18:30,372 --> 00:18:32,966
She'll try to line you up
with one of her friends.

219
00:18:35,412 --> 00:18:37,972
- I'll get her, Jack.
- Sorry, Michael.

220
00:18:38,052 --> 00:18:40,441
She smells that meat and goes crazy.

221
00:18:40,532 --> 00:18:42,523
Meet me round the front.

222
00:18:42,612 --> 00:18:45,172
I'm sorry. I'm still a little freaked.

223
00:18:46,612 --> 00:18:48,603
That's OK.

224
00:18:48,692 --> 00:18:51,001
That's understandable.

225
00:18:51,092 --> 00:18:55,005
I can't believe
you've never been serious about anyone.

226
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:58,923
No.

227
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:02,482
Cops and marriage are a tough combination.

228
00:19:02,572 --> 00:19:03,561
So...

229
00:19:03,652 --> 00:19:06,007
I can't believe how much l'm talking.

230
00:19:06,092 --> 00:19:08,481
When l was a kid, l hardly ever talked.

231
00:19:08,572 --> 00:19:10,847
When l was in school, l nevertalked.

232
00:19:10,932 --> 00:19:12,126
I was famous for it.

233
00:19:12,212 --> 00:19:13,201
Oh.

234
00:19:13,292 --> 00:19:14,930
Take it from a teacher,

235
00:19:15,012 --> 00:19:18,288
we love those quiet boys
in the back ofthe class.

236
00:19:18,372 --> 00:19:21,887
Don't you believe her, Pete!
She loves all kids.

237
00:19:24,132 --> 00:19:25,804
That's what's missing.

238
00:19:25,892 --> 00:19:29,487
I'm surprised you two don't have
a few running around.

239
00:19:32,732 --> 00:19:34,723
I'm sorry about bringing up...

240
00:19:34,812 --> 00:19:37,451
..kids. It's really none of my business.

241
00:19:37,532 --> 00:19:39,568
Hey, l just wanted to thank you.

242
00:19:39,652 --> 00:19:42,849
You really went out ofyour way.
It did so much for Karen.

243
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,331
She'll bounce back.

244
00:19:44,412 --> 00:19:47,404
She'll bounce back
a lot quicker because ofyou.

245
00:19:47,492 --> 00:19:50,052
What about you? Have you bounced back?

246
00:19:51,092 --> 00:19:53,083
I don't know.

247
00:19:53,172 --> 00:19:56,687
A guy gets his hands on your wife like that,
you feel helpless.

248
00:19:56,772 --> 00:19:58,922
You did what you could, Michael.

249
00:19:59,012 --> 00:20:01,128
You showed a lot of balls.

250
00:20:01,212 --> 00:20:03,203
There was one moment where

251
00:20:03,292 --> 00:20:06,568
he had a hold of her
and l had that stupid golf club,

252
00:20:06,652 --> 00:20:08,643
I thought l could just...

253
00:20:09,892 --> 00:20:12,167
I didn't... I didn't take the shot.

254
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:16,723
A fucking nightmare when you think
about what could have happened.

255
00:20:16,812 --> 00:20:20,168
I wouldn't mind one more shot
at that son of a bitch.

256
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:22,243
- Really?
- Hell, yeah!

257
00:20:22,332 --> 00:20:24,448
I'd like to kick the shit out of him!

258
00:20:24,532 --> 00:20:26,727
- I'm sure you would.
- Wouldn't you?

259
00:20:26,812 --> 00:20:29,042
Oh, l already know what l would do.

260
00:20:29,412 --> 00:20:33,007
I'm just wondering about
a nice, civilised guy like you.

261
00:20:33,092 --> 00:20:37,165
After what he did to Karen,
l think all the rules are out the window.

262
00:20:37,252 --> 00:20:39,243
I'd rip his fucking heart out.

263
00:20:39,332 --> 00:20:41,243
Michael!

264
00:20:41,332 --> 00:20:43,323
You're a scary guy!

265
00:20:49,092 --> 00:20:51,083
Hey! You know,

266
00:20:51,172 --> 00:20:53,561
you'd enjoy coming on a ride-along.

267
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:56,689
- What's that?
- Riding along with us on patrol one night.

268
00:20:56,772 --> 00:21:00,287
- You can do that?
- We often do for writers, journalists...

269
00:21:00,372 --> 00:21:02,044
Uh-huh. It sounds...

270
00:21:02,132 --> 00:21:03,850
Yeah, l could do that.

271
00:21:03,932 --> 00:21:07,447
Great. I'm gonna set it up.
You come watch us kick some butt.

272
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:10,922
- When do you want to do it?
- Tomorrow.

273
00:21:11,012 --> 00:21:13,401
Come on. It'll be fun.

274
00:21:13,492 --> 00:21:15,403
Yeah. Why not?

275
00:21:15,492 --> 00:21:17,323
Great. I'll see you then.

276
00:21:29,492 --> 00:21:34,168
Sign it, so your old lady can't come after
the City ifyou get killed or maimed.

277
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:36,561
Nothing will happen to him. He's with me.

278
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:38,491
Hey, Pete.

279
00:21:41,492 --> 00:21:45,485
OK, Mike. A dope dealer,
a public defender and my ex-wife

280
00:21:45,572 --> 00:21:48,609
all get thrown offthe Empire State Building.

281
00:21:48,692 --> 00:21:50,922
Which one hits the cement first?

282
00:21:51,012 --> 00:21:53,207
I don't know. Who lands first?

283
00:21:53,292 --> 00:21:55,283
Who cares!

284
00:21:57,732 --> 00:21:59,404
Oh, oh, oh!

285
00:21:59,492 --> 00:22:01,483
Oh, my gosh, look at this!

286
00:22:01,572 --> 00:22:04,166
Do you think she's a real blonde, Roy?

287
00:22:10,492 --> 00:22:12,289
Officer.

288
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,363
Was l going too fast?

289
00:22:14,452 --> 00:22:17,649
Do you have a licence and a registration,
ma'am?

290
00:22:17,732 --> 00:22:19,723
Yes.

291
00:22:19,812 --> 00:22:23,088
Certain types ofwomen
just have a thing for cops.

292
00:22:23,172 --> 00:22:25,481
They think we're like movie stars.

293
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:53,489
If we were to search
any one ofthese assholes,

294
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:56,245
we'd be up to our butts in drugs and guns.

295
00:22:56,332 --> 00:22:59,130
This place is one giant supermarket of shit.

296
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:02,409
- Right, Leon?
- Whatever you say, Officer Pete.

297
00:23:02,492 --> 00:23:05,768
- This is Mr Clean here.
- That's right, that's me.

298
00:23:05,852 --> 00:23:07,524
Yes, sir. Mr Clean.

299
00:23:09,492 --> 00:23:11,084
Maria! Como esta?

300
00:23:11,172 --> 00:23:12,890
Yeah!

301
00:23:12,972 --> 00:23:14,849
Everything OK? No problemas?

302
00:23:14,932 --> 00:23:16,126
No, no problemas.

303
00:23:16,212 --> 00:23:18,203
If there is, let me know, OK?

304
00:23:21,092 --> 00:23:25,324
You won't be finding any clientele
for your club around here, Michael.

305
00:23:32,092 --> 00:23:34,652
Try it. The best in LA.

306
00:23:34,732 --> 00:23:36,882
You know, l ate before l came out.

307
00:23:36,972 --> 00:23:38,963
I'm really full.

308
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:43,328
So, are you enjoying yourself?

309
00:23:43,412 --> 00:23:46,290
Yeah. Yeah, it's an eye-opener.

310
00:23:46,372 --> 00:23:51,400
Something occurred to me when you were
at the house for the barbecue, Pete.

311
00:23:51,492 --> 00:23:54,052
I don't know how it works
here in Los Angeles.

312
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:55,690
When l was in Phoenix,

313
00:23:55,772 --> 00:23:59,401
I used to hire off-duty police officers
to ward the club.

314
00:23:59,492 --> 00:24:02,484
Hear that? Mike's offering us
moonlighting money.

315
00:24:02,572 --> 00:24:04,563
- I'd like to talk to you...
- Hi.

316
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:06,165
Hi.

317
00:24:06,252 --> 00:24:08,083
So, how are you?

318
00:24:08,172 --> 00:24:10,640
Are you like a captain, or something?

319
00:24:11,092 --> 00:24:13,083
Lieutenant.

320
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:16,408
Come on, vamonos!

321
00:24:16,492 --> 00:24:19,211
Can't you see the lieutenant's married?

322
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:21,283
Oh, yeah? Oh.

323
00:24:21,372 --> 00:24:23,363
Oh, well. Ya me voy.

324
00:24:23,452 --> 00:24:26,808
- Bye, Pete.
- See you later, Rosa.

325
00:24:26,892 --> 00:24:29,087
These bitches can't get enough of us.

326
00:24:37,092 --> 00:24:39,083
Michael, stay here.

327
00:24:43,532 --> 00:24:45,523
Keep away!

328
00:24:48,692 --> 00:24:50,648
Police! Everything all right in there?

329
00:24:50,732 --> 00:24:52,723
No! Everything is not all right!

330
00:24:52,812 --> 00:24:55,565
Fucking asshole jailbird
is on the fucking bed!

331
00:24:55,652 --> 00:24:57,608
Fuck you, fuck you.

332
00:25:12,532 --> 00:25:15,046
There you go. Are you all right?

333
00:25:15,452 --> 00:25:18,410
Come on, boy.
Why don't you stay here with me?

334
00:25:18,492 --> 00:25:20,722
Roy, l'm taking him out.

335
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:25,647
Take that piece of shit
back to the jailhouse where he belongs!

336
00:25:26,452 --> 00:25:28,807
Mom! Mommy!

337
00:25:36,212 --> 00:25:38,772
See? They got him.

338
00:25:50,292 --> 00:25:52,931
Roy, why don't you go
and get yourself cleaned up?

339
00:25:53,012 --> 00:25:55,367
Me and Michael will put the car to bed.

340
00:25:55,452 --> 00:25:57,443
It works for me.

341
00:25:57,532 --> 00:25:59,682
- Later, gentlemen.
- Take care.

342
00:26:04,092 --> 00:26:06,162
It's a hell of a life, huh, Mike?

343
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:09,210
- Is it always like this?
- Day in and day out.

344
00:26:09,292 --> 00:26:11,283
Come on. Hop up in front.

345
00:26:13,052 --> 00:26:16,488
Your wife wants to know
why l can't meet a nice woman.

346
00:26:17,212 --> 00:26:20,124
I thought you guys handled it all pretty well.

347
00:26:20,212 --> 00:26:22,328
Where are we headed?

348
00:26:22,412 --> 00:26:24,642
Just got one more errand to run.

349
00:26:35,172 --> 00:26:37,083
Come on! Move!

350
00:26:37,172 --> 00:26:38,446
Michael!

351
00:26:42,532 --> 00:26:43,647
Stay there.

352
00:26:43,732 --> 00:26:46,769
Michael. Meet Ernie Pike.

353
00:26:46,852 --> 00:26:48,968
Come out and ID this piece of shit.

354
00:26:49,052 --> 00:26:51,043
Come on, motherfucker!

355
00:26:51,932 --> 00:26:54,969
That's him!
You got him, goddamn! That's him.

356
00:26:55,052 --> 00:26:57,486
Did you hear that? You've just been made.

357
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:00,642
You've just been made, scumbag!

358
00:27:02,012 --> 00:27:05,527
Picked up a crackhead pal of his.
Turned in Pike here.

359
00:27:06,372 --> 00:27:09,091
You broke into my friend's house? Huh?

360
00:27:09,172 --> 00:27:11,640
Did you scare him and his pretty wife?

361
00:27:11,772 --> 00:27:13,842
Did you do that? Did you do that?

362
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:17,163
OK. I'm sorry, man. OK?

363
00:27:17,252 --> 00:27:19,243
Fuck off!

364
00:27:20,332 --> 00:27:22,562
He doesn't want to hear you're sorry.

365
00:27:23,652 --> 00:27:25,643
He wants to kick your ass!

366
00:27:25,732 --> 00:27:27,723
Guess what, scumbag?

367
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,803
I'm gonna let him.

368
00:27:30,892 --> 00:27:33,611
- Ready?
- What?

369
00:27:33,692 --> 00:27:35,648
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

370
00:27:35,732 --> 00:27:37,609
Are you serious?

371
00:27:37,692 --> 00:27:40,729
Yeah! You said you wanted
to rip his fucking heart out!

372
00:27:40,812 --> 00:27:42,609
Well, yeah, yeah.

373
00:27:42,692 --> 00:27:45,809
But, l mean, that was... just talking.

374
00:27:45,892 --> 00:27:47,803
Tell him. Say it!

375
00:27:47,892 --> 00:27:50,281
Say how you wanted that uptown pussy.

376
00:27:50,372 --> 00:27:53,489
- Is that what you wanted? Say it!
- No, man.

377
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:56,689
Say it! Tell him!

378
00:27:56,772 --> 00:27:58,728
Whatever you say, man.

379
00:27:59,332 --> 00:28:00,765
Come here!

380
00:28:00,852 --> 00:28:02,843
Don't fucking resist me!

381
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:04,923
Don't you resist me!

382
00:28:06,532 --> 00:28:08,523
Now, walk!

383
00:28:08,612 --> 00:28:10,603
I said walk.

384
00:28:12,012 --> 00:28:16,324
I just gave you the OK.
You don't even have to touch him.

385
00:28:16,412 --> 00:28:18,801
I wasn't going to hurt nobody, man.

386
00:28:18,892 --> 00:28:20,484
Shut up.

387
00:28:20,572 --> 00:28:23,962
Come on!
Come on, Michael. It's OK, listen.

388
00:28:24,052 --> 00:28:26,691
He resisted, he gets hit. Shit happens.

389
00:28:26,772 --> 00:28:28,763
Come on, Pete. You got him.

390
00:28:28,852 --> 00:28:30,729
Nice going. Just take him in.

391
00:28:30,812 --> 00:28:34,202
Michael... He put a knife to Karen's throat.

392
00:28:34,292 --> 00:28:37,204
Are you going to let him get away with that?

393
00:28:37,292 --> 00:28:38,691
Come on! Hit the motherfucker!

394
00:28:38,772 --> 00:28:40,569
- Pete...
- Hit him!

395
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:42,131
He's just...

396
00:28:42,212 --> 00:28:44,203
Hey, no. I'm not doing this.

397
00:28:44,892 --> 00:28:46,883
Hey!

398
00:28:50,372 --> 00:28:52,488
Motherfucker!

399
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:57,404
Pete! Pete! Jesus, that's enough!

400
00:29:11,772 --> 00:29:13,763
Honey?

401
00:29:14,612 --> 00:29:16,204
Michael?

402
00:29:16,292 --> 00:29:18,886
Yeah. It's me.

403
00:29:26,012 --> 00:29:28,003
How did it go?

404
00:29:30,212 --> 00:29:32,203
Boy, what a screwed-up night.

405
00:29:32,292 --> 00:29:33,805
What happened?

406
00:29:33,892 --> 00:29:35,883
It was just... It was weird.

407
00:29:37,332 --> 00:29:41,245
I went with the guys on a few calls.
Got to watch them be cops.

408
00:29:43,372 --> 00:29:47,047
We dropped Roy off
and Pete had a little surprise for me.

409
00:29:47,372 --> 00:29:49,044
The guy who broke in here.

410
00:29:49,132 --> 00:29:51,851
- He caught him?
- He did a little more than that.

411
00:29:51,932 --> 00:29:55,208
- The guy's in jail?
- Hospital's more likely.

412
00:29:55,292 --> 00:30:00,241
He beat the living shit out ofthis guy,
which is what l was supposed to do.

413
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:03,802
- I don't understand.
- Pete was showing offfor me.

414
00:30:03,892 --> 00:30:07,771
He had it all set up, so l could be
the big man and nail the guy.

415
00:30:07,852 --> 00:30:09,808
Michael, l'm just glad it's over.

416
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:11,291
Yeah.

417
00:30:15,012 --> 00:30:17,003
Are you sure you're OK?

418
00:30:17,092 --> 00:30:19,083
Yeah.

419
00:30:21,092 --> 00:30:23,083
What's the matter, huh?

420
00:30:23,892 --> 00:30:25,883
Just...

421
00:30:25,972 --> 00:30:30,204
I think our cop friend
is a little too tightly wound, that's all.

422
00:30:30,292 --> 00:30:33,728
Do you think you might be
overreacting a little bit?

423
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,323
Not really.

424
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:40,005
I feel like a big weight's been lifted.

425
00:30:40,092 --> 00:30:42,447
Yeah. I'm glad you feel better.

426
00:30:42,532 --> 00:30:45,410
But l'm serious.
I don't want him here any more.

427
00:30:45,492 --> 00:30:47,323
You're upset and l understand,

428
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:50,404
but shouldn't we give him
the benefit ofthe doubt?

429
00:30:50,492 --> 00:30:53,643
Maybe he got rough,
but you're acting like Pete's the criminal.

430
00:30:53,732 --> 00:30:56,769
Am l? l was there, Karen. I saw it.

431
00:30:56,852 --> 00:31:00,049
I don't care what you think.
We stay away from this guy.

432
00:31:00,132 --> 00:31:02,123
You don't care what l think?

433
00:31:02,212 --> 00:31:04,203
Fine. I won't bother thinking.

434
00:31:04,292 --> 00:31:06,567
- Knock it off.
- No, you knock it off!

435
00:31:06,652 --> 00:31:09,450
I'm sorry, but l don't share your sympathy

436
00:31:09,532 --> 00:31:13,605
for the man who broke in here
and put a goddamn knife to my throat.

437
00:32:10,492 --> 00:32:12,926
Hi. Sorry, l didn't mean to scare you.

438
00:32:13,012 --> 00:32:15,162
It's OK.

439
00:32:15,252 --> 00:32:18,164
Can l talk to you for a minute? Please?

440
00:32:18,252 --> 00:32:20,243
Just let me get my robe.

441
00:32:30,492 --> 00:32:33,211
You really should put a lock on that gate.

442
00:32:34,612 --> 00:32:37,649
I don't think you came here
to discuss my gate.

443
00:32:37,732 --> 00:32:39,723
No.

444
00:32:41,972 --> 00:32:44,361
Did you hear l arrested the burglar?

445
00:32:44,452 --> 00:32:46,443
What happened?

446
00:32:47,292 --> 00:32:50,568
What happened was
the burglar knocked me down

447
00:32:50,652 --> 00:32:52,449
and took off running.

448
00:32:52,532 --> 00:32:54,762
When l caught him, he resisted

449
00:32:54,852 --> 00:32:56,808
and it got ugly.

450
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:59,452
I don't think Michael took it too well.

451
00:32:59,532 --> 00:33:01,682
He didn't quite put it that way.

452
00:33:02,852 --> 00:33:05,320
It's not a TV show out there, Mrs Carr.

453
00:33:05,412 --> 00:33:09,007
The reality gets to people
who've never seen it up close.

454
00:33:09,092 --> 00:33:11,083
You mean the violence.

455
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:15,083
Look,

456
00:33:16,492 --> 00:33:18,483
when l first started out,

457
00:33:18,572 --> 00:33:20,563
I went on a routine call.

458
00:33:21,572 --> 00:33:23,881
There was a young kid high on drugs.

459
00:33:23,972 --> 00:33:26,202
He was beating on his girlfriend.

460
00:33:26,772 --> 00:33:29,650
She couldn't have been more than 15, 16,

461
00:33:29,732 --> 00:33:32,292
sweet girl, blonde hair, blue eyes.

462
00:33:32,372 --> 00:33:34,681
So l didn't pay her much attention.

463
00:33:35,492 --> 00:33:37,881
I was reading the kid his rights,

464
00:33:38,772 --> 00:33:42,208
when she took out a gun
and she shot me right here

465
00:33:42,292 --> 00:33:44,283
in the chest.

466
00:33:45,652 --> 00:33:48,530
Now l restrain felons first
with whatever it takes.

467
00:33:48,612 --> 00:33:52,082
With whatever it takes.
That's how it was last night.

468
00:33:52,172 --> 00:33:56,324
I don't need another bullet in the chest,
you don't need a dead husband.

469
00:33:56,412 --> 00:33:58,642
I'm very sorry if Michael's upset.

470
00:33:58,732 --> 00:34:00,723
I was just doing myjob.

471
00:34:00,812 --> 00:34:02,928
Pete... Pete, wait.

472
00:34:08,092 --> 00:34:10,083
I'm glad you got him.

473
00:34:12,372 --> 00:34:17,685
That guy's not going to forget the night
he made the mistake of breaking in here!

474
00:34:19,572 --> 00:34:21,563
OK. Enjoy your swim.

475
00:34:46,092 --> 00:34:48,083
This is the Chromalight.

476
00:34:48,172 --> 00:34:52,723
It's the backdrop to the dance floor,
which could also spill out onto this floor.

477
00:34:52,812 --> 00:34:55,724
With this Chromalight,
we can create any environment.

478
00:34:55,812 --> 00:34:59,646
This is a cityscape but we can create
a desert, a mountain... anything.

479
00:35:05,052 --> 00:35:08,840
Why didn't l know Michael
had so many good-looking friends?

480
00:35:08,932 --> 00:35:11,651
Are you kidding?
We don't know any ofthese people.

481
00:35:11,732 --> 00:35:15,202
They're potential investors
or friends of Michael's lawyer.

482
00:35:17,172 --> 00:35:19,163
That's too bad!

483
00:35:20,412 --> 00:35:22,562
Now, there's one l'd like to meet.

484
00:35:24,452 --> 00:35:27,012
That's the guy l was telling you about.

485
00:35:27,092 --> 00:35:29,083
Your cop? Really?

486
00:35:37,492 --> 00:35:40,290
- Candace said the music is too loud.
- What? Who?

487
00:35:40,372 --> 00:35:42,840
- Candace, my wife.
- I like it like this.

488
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:45,241
Roger, l got a question only you can answer.

489
00:35:45,332 --> 00:35:49,803
I got an IRS auditor and a lawyer
on top ofthe World Trade Center.

490
00:35:49,892 --> 00:35:52,122
They both jump off at the same time.

491
00:35:52,212 --> 00:35:54,203
- Who lands first?
- Who cares!

492
00:35:54,292 --> 00:35:56,123
Hi! How are you doing, Mike?

493
00:35:56,212 --> 00:35:57,201
Pete.

494
00:35:57,292 --> 00:35:59,283
This place is great.

495
00:35:59,372 --> 00:36:01,363
Thanks.

496
00:36:02,372 --> 00:36:04,363
Pete Davis, Los Angeles Police.

497
00:36:04,532 --> 00:36:06,124
Hello, Pete. Jerry Lurie.

498
00:36:06,212 --> 00:36:07,884
- My wife Candace.
- Hi, Pete.

499
00:36:07,972 --> 00:36:08,882
Roger Graham.

500
00:36:08,972 --> 00:36:11,645
Mike's been talking to me about club security.

501
00:36:11,732 --> 00:36:14,121
Are you working the area tonight?

502
00:36:14,212 --> 00:36:18,091
No,... I did the precheck ofthe exterior.

503
00:36:19,852 --> 00:36:24,972
I know it's normal to have your entrance
under the marquee, but it's too open.

504
00:36:25,052 --> 00:36:29,728
It would be better to put the entrance
in the alley and make the people line up.

505
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:33,725
So ifwe ever have to get heavy,
only a few people will see it.

506
00:36:33,812 --> 00:36:35,803
Something to think about.

507
00:36:37,372 --> 00:36:41,763
Why don't you get yourself a drink
and l'll be with you in a minute?

508
00:36:42,252 --> 00:36:45,369
Good idea.
I know you have business to discuss.

509
00:36:45,452 --> 00:36:47,010
I'll fill you in later.

510
00:36:47,092 --> 00:36:48,844
Take care. Nice meeting you.

511
00:36:48,932 --> 00:36:51,446
He makes a lot of sense.

512
00:36:51,532 --> 00:36:54,649
You guys really aren't bullshitting.

513
00:36:55,212 --> 00:36:58,682
- I take security very seriously.
- We're really on top of it.

514
00:36:59,572 --> 00:37:01,324
Hi there.

515
00:37:01,412 --> 00:37:03,403
Oh, Penny. This is Pete.

516
00:37:03,492 --> 00:37:05,528
- Pete, Penny.
- Hi. Nice meeting you.

517
00:37:05,612 --> 00:37:07,489
Hi, nice meeting you.

518
00:37:07,572 --> 00:37:11,042
- We teach together.
- Oh! Oh...

519
00:37:11,132 --> 00:37:15,011
The pupils would be so impressed
that l'm talking to you. They love cops.

520
00:37:15,092 --> 00:37:17,765
They're young. Give them time!

521
00:37:18,812 --> 00:37:21,724
Maybe you'd like
to give them a talk some time?

522
00:37:21,812 --> 00:37:23,211
Erm...

523
00:37:23,292 --> 00:37:24,611
Yeah, sure.

524
00:37:24,692 --> 00:37:27,286
Public relations love stuff like that.

525
00:37:27,372 --> 00:37:30,284
Speaking of public relations, do you dance?

526
00:37:30,372 --> 00:37:32,567
Honey! Can you rescue Roger for me?

527
00:37:32,652 --> 00:37:33,801
Hi, Penny.

528
00:37:33,892 --> 00:37:36,008
Come on, Pete. Let's get that drink.

529
00:37:37,092 --> 00:37:39,083
Here's to your club, Mike.

530
00:37:40,052 --> 00:37:41,121
Pete.

531
00:37:41,212 --> 00:37:43,680
I want to get something straight here.

532
00:37:43,772 --> 00:37:45,205
I'd like you to leave.

533
00:37:45,292 --> 00:37:47,647
Michael, what is with you tonight?

534
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:49,962
Why did you even invite me here?

535
00:37:50,052 --> 00:37:54,523
Telling you and inviting you
are two completely different things.

536
00:37:54,612 --> 00:37:56,603
You seem so uptight. Relax!

537
00:37:56,692 --> 00:37:59,411
Is it because you were up late last night?

538
00:37:59,492 --> 00:38:01,483
How do you know that?

539
00:38:01,572 --> 00:38:05,281
I drove past your house on patrol
and saw your lights were on.

540
00:38:05,372 --> 00:38:07,090
You went to bed after three.

541
00:38:07,172 --> 00:38:10,164
You don't have to protect us now.
You caught him.

542
00:38:10,252 --> 00:38:12,891
One guy's caught and you think that's it?

543
00:38:12,972 --> 00:38:16,408
You saw how much evil shit
there is out there.

544
00:38:16,492 --> 00:38:20,565
What kind offriend would l be
if l didn't try to protect you and Karen?

545
00:38:20,652 --> 00:38:24,725
Goddammit, you listen to me,
cos l'm telling you, leave us alone!

546
00:38:26,092 --> 00:38:30,051
You know, l think l understand
where this is coming from.

547
00:38:30,132 --> 00:38:32,851
- Do you?
- Just cut the shit, OK?

548
00:38:33,212 --> 00:38:37,205
Nobody expects you to be me. I'm a cop.

549
00:38:37,292 --> 00:38:39,806
I make my living tackling guys like Pike.

550
00:38:39,892 --> 00:38:41,883
You don't. You needn't be ashamed.

551
00:38:41,972 --> 00:38:43,883
- You think this is about that?
- Yeah.

552
00:38:43,972 --> 00:38:47,885
I bet you had one hell of a night
last night when you got home.

553
00:38:47,972 --> 00:38:50,202
Juices flowing and everything.

554
00:38:50,292 --> 00:38:52,248
A friend would be thanking me.

555
00:38:52,332 --> 00:38:55,847
I'm not your friend.
I'm nothing to you. You got that?

556
00:38:55,932 --> 00:38:59,402
You're a sick guy.
I don't want you around me or my wife.

557
00:38:59,492 --> 00:39:02,370
- Michael, your guests...
- I'll be there in a second.

558
00:39:02,452 --> 00:39:05,762
Michael needs
to get some things off his chest.

559
00:39:05,852 --> 00:39:07,604
- Roger...
- Honey, please!

560
00:39:07,692 --> 00:39:10,650
- Are you kicking me out?
- Don't keep them waiting.

561
00:39:10,732 --> 00:39:12,324
If l have to.

562
00:39:12,412 --> 00:39:15,051
Tell Roger l'll be there in a second, OK?

563
00:39:22,172 --> 00:39:24,163
What are you gonna do?

564
00:39:24,892 --> 00:39:27,247
Call the cops?

565
00:39:28,212 --> 00:39:29,281
Get the fuck out.

566
00:39:29,372 --> 00:39:30,327
Lower your voice.

567
00:39:30,412 --> 00:39:32,926
Fuck you. Fuck you!

568
00:39:33,012 --> 00:39:35,003
The pigeon's watching.

569
00:39:38,812 --> 00:39:41,007
I hope he doesn't fly away on you.

570
00:40:10,372 --> 00:40:12,363
Can l get your car?

571
00:40:13,612 --> 00:40:15,603
Ticket.

572
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:23,930
Weren't you a little rough on Pete?

573
00:40:24,012 --> 00:40:27,800
I don't want him coming round.
I wanted to make that clear.

574
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:29,928
- You succeeded.
- Honey, please.

575
00:40:30,012 --> 00:40:32,162
Come on, it's time for our toast.

576
00:40:40,812 --> 00:40:44,009
Good health, good fortune,
and the time to enjoy it.

577
00:40:44,092 --> 00:40:46,083
It's an old Castilian toast.

578
00:40:48,572 --> 00:40:52,884
It looks like you've just
made these two people very happy.

579
00:40:52,972 --> 00:40:56,248
I think we'll all have reason to be happy

580
00:40:56,332 --> 00:40:58,800
when everything falls in place, Roger.

581
00:41:01,092 --> 00:41:03,083
That is a nice ride!

582
00:41:08,852 --> 00:41:13,289
To the most charming women here!
Your beautiful wife and mine.

583
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:19,443
I'm glad you called.

584
00:42:20,252 --> 00:42:23,050
I've been thinking about you a lot lately.

585
00:42:32,732 --> 00:42:34,723
Leave it.

586
00:42:35,492 --> 00:42:37,483
Sorry.

587
00:42:38,492 --> 00:42:40,483
Still sensitive, huh?

588
00:42:43,492 --> 00:42:45,562
Did you get shot or something?

589
00:42:48,892 --> 00:42:50,883
It was a fishing accident.

590
00:42:51,732 --> 00:42:53,723
Yeah!

591
00:42:53,812 --> 00:42:55,803
Fishes with guns.

592
00:43:03,092 --> 00:43:05,083
Are you all right?

593
00:43:06,492 --> 00:43:08,483
Cos we can go to a motel.

594
00:43:08,572 --> 00:43:10,563
A nice, cosy bed

595
00:43:10,652 --> 00:43:12,643
if you're having a problem.

596
00:43:13,652 --> 00:43:15,643
Problem...

597
00:43:26,852 --> 00:43:29,366
The only problem that l have

598
00:43:31,052 --> 00:43:33,885
is sleazy, lowlife whores like you.

599
00:43:35,092 --> 00:43:37,481
That's my problem.

600
00:43:38,692 --> 00:43:40,648
What the hell's wrong with you?

601
00:43:40,732 --> 00:43:43,166
- Get out.
- I'm not getting out here!

602
00:43:43,252 --> 00:43:45,846
- Get the fuck out!
- Are you crazy?

603
00:43:45,932 --> 00:43:50,403
- I don't know where the fuck l am!
- That's exactly your fucking problem!

604
00:43:50,732 --> 00:43:52,723
Isn't it?

605
00:44:04,972 --> 00:44:09,284
So, being a policeman
is reallyallabouthelpingpeople.

606
00:44:09,892 --> 00:44:11,883
It's about being a friend.

607
00:44:11,972 --> 00:44:15,169
It's not about shooting it out with bad guys,

608
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:17,243
that's what you see on TV.

609
00:44:17,332 --> 00:44:19,892
That's not why l wanted to become a cop.

610
00:44:19,972 --> 00:44:22,930
I wanted to become a cop to protect people,

611
00:44:23,012 --> 00:44:26,243
to make them feel happy and safe.

612
00:44:26,412 --> 00:44:29,051
- Everybody understand that?
- Yes.

613
00:44:29,132 --> 00:44:31,327
Anybody have any questions?

614
00:44:31,412 --> 00:44:34,006
- What?
- Do you wear bulletproof vests?

615
00:44:34,092 --> 00:44:36,003
I have to, to protect myself.

616
00:44:36,092 --> 00:44:37,491
Who else?

617
00:44:37,572 --> 00:44:40,769
In the police car,
are you always with somebody?

618
00:44:40,852 --> 00:44:43,730
I have a partner.
His name is Officer Roy Cole.

619
00:44:43,812 --> 00:44:47,566
We've spent time together
for the past seven, eight years.

620
00:44:47,652 --> 00:44:49,608
He's a very good friend of mine.

621
00:44:49,692 --> 00:44:50,681
OK, you.

622
00:44:50,772 --> 00:44:53,286
Could you show me
how to use your handcuffs?

623
00:44:53,372 --> 00:44:54,885
Sure.

624
00:44:54,972 --> 00:44:56,803
Come here.

625
00:44:56,892 --> 00:44:58,883
- What's your name?
- Matthew.

626
00:44:58,972 --> 00:45:00,325
All right, Matthew.

627
00:45:00,412 --> 00:45:01,845
Put your hands out.

628
00:45:03,292 --> 00:45:06,250
Do you think l could get him
to use those on me?

629
00:45:06,332 --> 00:45:09,324
There you go.
You're under arrest, Matthew!

630
00:45:14,092 --> 00:45:18,882
Hi. I couldn't go without saying thanks
for letting me impress the kids.

631
00:45:18,972 --> 00:45:21,850
- It was a lot offun.
- Penny really set it up.

632
00:45:21,932 --> 00:45:24,002
Yeah, l talked to Penny before.

633
00:45:25,132 --> 00:45:27,805
I'd like to apologise for the other night.

634
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:31,009
- Michael's behaviour...
- It took me by surprise.

635
00:45:31,092 --> 00:45:34,368
He invited me and kicked me out.
I would never have come.

636
00:45:34,452 --> 00:45:36,443
Pete, it's not you, it's him.

637
00:45:36,532 --> 00:45:38,523
He's not been himself lately.

638
00:45:39,812 --> 00:45:42,280
Would you like to go get a cup of coffee?

639
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:44,363
I... don't go on for a while.

640
00:45:44,452 --> 00:45:46,647
I don't think it's such a good idea.

641
00:45:46,732 --> 00:45:49,929
Come on, you're safe with me.
I'm a cop, remember!

642
00:45:50,012 --> 00:45:52,731
- Just for a little while?
- Yeah. Just...

643
00:46:00,972 --> 00:46:02,963
Is everybody in here a cop?

644
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:05,043
Yeah, pretty much.

645
00:46:05,132 --> 00:46:07,805
About a year ago,
some jerk came in here

646
00:46:07,892 --> 00:46:10,122
and tried to rip this place off!

647
00:46:11,492 --> 00:46:14,882
When he finally come
crashing through the skylight,

648
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:16,963
I say, "How's your dick?"

649
00:46:17,052 --> 00:46:19,691
I'm sorry. We should go somewhere else.

650
00:46:19,772 --> 00:46:22,206
- No, this is great.
- Really?

651
00:46:22,292 --> 00:46:25,489
I think it's really nice you've got a place to go.

652
00:46:25,572 --> 00:46:27,563
I'd like one. Just...

653
00:46:27,652 --> 00:46:29,847
This is...

654
00:46:29,932 --> 00:46:32,730
This is my least favourite time ofthe day.

655
00:46:32,812 --> 00:46:35,121
- Why?
- Erm...

656
00:46:35,212 --> 00:46:38,966
I guess it's getting dark out
and Michael's not home yet.

657
00:46:40,892 --> 00:46:43,281
How did you and Michael get together?

658
00:46:45,852 --> 00:46:48,810
- I was a waitress in his first club.
- Really?

659
00:46:48,892 --> 00:46:52,202
- You were a waitress?
- It was the firstjob l ever had.

660
00:46:52,292 --> 00:46:54,283
The first one l needed.

661
00:46:55,492 --> 00:46:57,483
We were kind ofwell off.

662
00:46:57,572 --> 00:47:02,123
My father, as it turned out,
had sort of gambling problems.

663
00:47:02,212 --> 00:47:04,203
And l, erm...

664
00:47:04,292 --> 00:47:08,365
People started coming over
and taking our cars in the night.

665
00:47:08,452 --> 00:47:10,488
It was kind of a scary time.

666
00:47:10,572 --> 00:47:12,802
Did Michael take you away from all that?

667
00:47:12,892 --> 00:47:16,441
Things always came really easily to Michael.

668
00:47:16,532 --> 00:47:18,523
Is that why you married him?

669
00:47:22,452 --> 00:47:25,410
I married him because l fell in love with him.

670
00:47:32,092 --> 00:47:34,083
This is...

671
00:47:35,292 --> 00:47:37,283
I hardly know you

672
00:47:37,372 --> 00:47:39,442
and we're talking like this.

673
00:47:39,532 --> 00:47:43,445
Karen, all the things
that come so easily to Michael,

674
00:47:43,532 --> 00:47:45,523
were you one ofthem?

675
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:48,604
Cos no man deserves
that much good fortune.

676
00:47:48,692 --> 00:47:51,081
And l mean that.

677
00:47:51,172 --> 00:47:54,687
A woman like you,
a man should never take for granted.

678
00:47:54,892 --> 00:47:57,964
And you should never feel unsafe.

679
00:47:58,932 --> 00:48:00,650
And l want you to know,

680
00:48:00,732 --> 00:48:03,292
that ifyou ever need anything,

681
00:48:03,372 --> 00:48:07,126
you're feeling bad in any way
or you just need to talk,

682
00:48:07,212 --> 00:48:09,680
then l'm there for you.

683
00:48:09,772 --> 00:48:11,763
OK? As a friend.

684
00:48:11,852 --> 00:48:14,161
As a real friend, l'm there for you.

685
00:48:16,692 --> 00:48:18,683
OK?

686
00:48:21,692 --> 00:48:23,091
Come on.

687
00:48:23,172 --> 00:48:25,163
Let me get you out of here.

688
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:07,683
How was your afternoon?

689
00:49:07,772 --> 00:49:09,763
Hey, good. It was fine.

690
00:49:11,292 --> 00:49:13,522
You and Mrs Carr getting along OK?

691
00:49:21,492 --> 00:49:23,767
We seem to be.

692
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:30,563
When l was a kid at Erasmus,

693
00:49:30,652 --> 00:49:34,406
I didn't have a single teacher
that looked like Karen.

694
00:49:34,492 --> 00:49:38,804
They all had blue hair with names
like Mushbutt or Silvercrone.

695
00:49:40,812 --> 00:49:42,962
Silvercrone's my maiden name.

696
00:49:46,092 --> 00:49:48,083
She had me!

697
00:49:50,252 --> 00:49:53,642
The good news is Frank Taft
was so taken with you,

698
00:49:53,732 --> 00:49:56,371
he's considering kicking in halfthe capital.

699
00:49:56,452 --> 00:49:59,649
- Frank Taft... Blue Moon Records?
- We handle him.

700
00:49:59,732 --> 00:50:02,371
- That company's on a roll.
- Major roll.

701
00:50:02,452 --> 00:50:04,329
I don't listen to that shit myself...

702
00:50:04,412 --> 00:50:06,562
Sorry, sir. Do you have another card?

703
00:50:06,652 --> 00:50:08,847
- What's the problem?
- It's cancelled.

704
00:50:08,932 --> 00:50:11,048
It's impossible.

705
00:50:11,132 --> 00:50:13,168
Computer glitch. It happens to me.

706
00:50:13,252 --> 00:50:15,288
This is... It's unbelievable.

707
00:50:15,372 --> 00:50:17,442
Relax, you'll get the next one.

708
00:50:21,132 --> 00:50:23,930
All right, now we're on for Tuesday night.

709
00:50:24,012 --> 00:50:26,242
- Bye!
- Take care.

710
00:50:26,332 --> 00:50:28,323
Michael, what's that?

711
00:50:28,412 --> 00:50:31,688
It looks like you're having a bad night,
Michael.

712
00:50:35,772 --> 00:50:39,128
All lknowis what's on
the computerprintout.

713
00:50:39,212 --> 00:50:41,806
It says you have
parking tickets up the wazoo.

714
00:50:41,892 --> 00:50:43,689
And the computer is wrong.

715
00:50:43,772 --> 00:50:46,445
I'm not paying $600
for tickets l didn't get.

716
00:50:46,532 --> 00:50:48,488
I've been working here five years.

717
00:50:48,572 --> 00:50:50,563
The computer's never wrong.

718
00:50:50,652 --> 00:50:53,530
Do you want the boot
taken offyour car or not?

719
00:50:54,412 --> 00:50:56,482
Unbelievable.

720
00:50:58,652 --> 00:51:00,643
Wait a minute, not that one.

721
00:51:03,612 --> 00:51:05,682
Honey, are you sure about this?

722
00:51:05,772 --> 00:51:09,048
Remember the night
we went to the Minzers' house?

723
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:11,521
They had the party on Canyon Avenue.

724
00:51:11,612 --> 00:51:14,809
I got a ticket, one ticket.
$600? Come on, Jesus!

725
00:51:14,932 --> 00:51:17,651
Sorry, pal, you're over the limit on this card.

726
00:51:25,292 --> 00:51:28,489
It's a computer thing, like Roger said.

727
00:51:28,572 --> 00:51:30,563
Yeah, all right.

728
00:51:32,572 --> 00:51:34,847
$600.

729
00:51:34,932 --> 00:51:38,322
Michael, drop it!
Things went pretty well, didn't they?

730
00:51:38,412 --> 00:51:40,972
- Yeah.
- I thought they went pretty good.

731
00:51:41,052 --> 00:51:43,202
You know what?

732
00:51:43,292 --> 00:51:45,886
They went great.

733
00:51:47,412 --> 00:51:51,963
- You really charmed the pants off Lurie.
- Oh, please!

734
00:51:52,052 --> 00:51:54,043
Thanks.

735
00:52:55,532 --> 00:52:57,284
Stay here and lock the door.

736
00:52:57,372 --> 00:52:59,044
- What are you doing?
- Do it!

737
00:53:24,292 --> 00:53:26,089
Karen, it's all right.

738
00:53:28,692 --> 00:53:30,683
Hello, yes.

739
00:53:30,772 --> 00:53:32,569
This is Michael Carr.

740
00:53:32,652 --> 00:53:35,450
Codeword is pyramid.

741
00:53:35,532 --> 00:53:38,569
We just had our cat
knock over a screen door.

742
00:53:38,652 --> 00:53:40,370
Thank you. Bye.

743
00:53:42,092 --> 00:53:44,890
I never thought l'd be so happy to see him.

744
00:53:51,292 --> 00:53:53,760
I thought it was the right thing to do.

745
00:53:53,852 --> 00:53:57,765
Thank you for making that decision
for both of us without my having a say.

746
00:53:57,852 --> 00:54:00,412
Goddammit, you know how l feel about guns!

747
00:54:00,492 --> 00:54:04,167
You know how l feel watching a man
come into my home and attack my wife?

748
00:54:04,252 --> 00:54:06,971
I won't be in that position again, Karen.

749
00:54:08,852 --> 00:54:12,447
I don't care what the police say.
I'm keeping that gun.

750
00:54:15,492 --> 00:54:17,801
I'm sorry. I should have told you.

751
00:54:21,772 --> 00:54:23,763
Are you all right?

752
00:54:23,852 --> 00:54:25,331
Yeah.

753
00:54:25,412 --> 00:54:27,004
Are you?

754
00:55:36,972 --> 00:55:38,963
Jesus Christ!

755
00:55:39,052 --> 00:55:41,043
Just a goddamn minute! Hey!

756
00:55:41,652 --> 00:55:43,483
What the fuck are you doing?

757
00:55:43,572 --> 00:55:46,370
I was responding to your alarm, Michael.

758
00:55:46,452 --> 00:55:49,171
- Bullshit! You tripped it yourself!
- What?

759
00:55:49,252 --> 00:55:52,801
And the credit card and the boot on my car!
You did that, didn't you?

760
00:55:52,892 --> 00:55:56,202
- Is everything all right?
- It's fine. Just a false alarm.

761
00:55:56,292 --> 00:55:58,089
False alarm, my ass!

762
00:55:58,172 --> 00:55:59,969
I'm embarrassed about this, too.

763
00:56:00,052 --> 00:56:02,008
Get the fuck out of my house!

764
00:56:03,092 --> 00:56:05,083
I'm very sorry, Mrs Carr.

765
00:56:15,652 --> 00:56:17,643
That son of a bitch is crazy.

766
00:56:27,052 --> 00:56:29,088
- Hello?
- Yeah, Roger.

767
00:56:29,172 --> 00:56:31,083
It's Michael. I know it's late.

768
00:56:31,172 --> 00:56:34,847
How do l get a psycho cop off my back?

769
00:56:38,212 --> 00:56:40,009
You're the Michael Carr...

770
00:56:40,092 --> 00:56:43,050
..that l okayed to do
a ride-along with Officer Davis?

771
00:56:43,132 --> 00:56:45,123
Yes, sir. That's right.

772
00:56:45,212 --> 00:56:48,727
The same Michael Carr whose wife called
to commend Officer Davis?

773
00:56:48,812 --> 00:56:54,091
The same two people that are now being
terrorised by this out-of-control sicko.

774
00:56:54,172 --> 00:56:55,969
Out-of-control sicko?

775
00:56:56,052 --> 00:56:58,771
Are you sure
there's nothing personal in this?

776
00:56:58,852 --> 00:57:01,412
There's no question that it's personal.

777
00:57:01,492 --> 00:57:04,802
He bust into my bedroom
when l was having sex with my wife.

778
00:57:06,092 --> 00:57:07,889
Yes, well...

779
00:57:07,972 --> 00:57:12,045
Officer Cole's report says
they were responding to an alarm.

780
00:57:12,132 --> 00:57:15,010
That was verified by your security company.

781
00:57:15,092 --> 00:57:18,562
Sure. How about the boot
he had put on my car? My credit cards?

782
00:57:18,652 --> 00:57:21,928
What about them?
Do you have proof he did those things?

783
00:57:22,012 --> 00:57:25,129
You're accusing a highly-decorated officer.

784
00:57:25,212 --> 00:57:27,521
I don't care how many medals he has.

785
00:57:27,612 --> 00:57:30,729
- I want this taken care of.
- Or else what, Mr Carr?

786
00:57:30,812 --> 00:57:33,849
You're not giving me anything. No evidence.

787
00:57:33,932 --> 00:57:37,242
You don't have any witnesses.
You don't even have a home video.

788
00:57:37,332 --> 00:57:40,290
These days, everybody's
got a goddamn home video.

789
00:57:40,372 --> 00:57:43,091
Fine. You're just going to bury this thing.

790
00:57:43,172 --> 00:57:46,721
Mr Carr! This is a professional organisation.

791
00:57:46,812 --> 00:57:49,770
We're going to do
a professional investigation, OK?

792
00:57:49,852 --> 00:57:52,924
Matt, bring me the complaint forms, will you?

793
00:57:53,012 --> 00:57:57,961
If there's any truth to your allegations,
we'll take care of it, all right?

794
00:57:58,732 --> 00:58:00,211
Thank you.

795
00:58:00,292 --> 00:58:05,002
The department doesn't want an unstable
officer on the street any more than you do.

796
00:58:05,092 --> 00:58:07,686
- Fill this out. Have you got a pen?
- No, sir.

797
00:58:07,772 --> 00:58:09,763
Thank you.

798
00:58:18,692 --> 00:58:21,650
- Roger, how are you doing?
- He's not coming.

799
00:58:21,732 --> 00:58:26,044
Your friend, Officer Davis, called Lurie
and asked him lots of questions.

800
00:58:26,132 --> 00:58:29,488
How well does he know you?
Has he done business with you before?

801
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:34,123
Lurie's pulling his people out.
He thinks you're under investigation.

802
00:58:34,212 --> 00:58:36,487
This fucker is ruining me.

803
00:58:36,572 --> 00:58:40,247
We can maybe smooth it over,
if we deal with your friend.

804
00:58:40,332 --> 00:58:43,449
I already filed a complaint, Roger.
You told me to do it.

805
00:58:43,532 --> 00:58:46,444
You know what this is?
Some kind of cop scam.

806
00:58:46,532 --> 00:58:49,922
This putz is just supplementing
his lousy income.

807
00:58:50,012 --> 00:58:51,923
Pay him off.

808
00:58:52,012 --> 00:58:56,563
Roger, as my lawyer,
you're advising me to bribe a police officer?

809
00:58:56,652 --> 00:59:00,850
No. I'm advising you to donate to
the son of a bitch's favourite charity.

810
00:59:33,133 --> 00:59:35,124
Thanks for meeting me, Pete.

811
00:59:35,213 --> 00:59:37,204
It gives us

812
00:59:38,493 --> 00:59:40,484
a chance to talk a little bit.

813
00:59:40,573 --> 00:59:43,770
You know, l don't remember
how this all began

814
00:59:43,853 --> 00:59:45,844
or what l did.

815
00:59:46,733 --> 00:59:50,123
But... whatever, l...

816
00:59:50,213 --> 00:59:51,362
I'm sorry.

817
00:59:51,453 --> 00:59:53,444
You know, l...

818
00:59:53,533 --> 00:59:56,445
I'm not looking to get you into trouble, Pete.

819
00:59:56,533 --> 00:59:58,842
I certainly don't need any myself.

820
00:59:59,453 --> 01:00:01,444
What do you say?

821
01:00:01,533 --> 01:00:03,524
Water under the bridge?

822
01:00:03,613 --> 01:00:06,002
Hell, we can part friends.

823
01:00:08,773 --> 01:00:11,492
Of course, l'll withdraw the complaint.

824
01:00:19,213 --> 01:00:21,204
OK. Here it is.

825
01:00:22,533 --> 01:00:24,524
- What's this?
- $5,000.

826
01:00:24,613 --> 01:00:28,242
You walk away
and don't mess with my investors.

827
01:00:28,933 --> 01:00:30,924
A bribe, Mikey?

828
01:00:31,013 --> 01:00:33,208
Call it whatever you want, Pete.

829
01:00:33,293 --> 01:00:35,284
- I need this deal.
- Sssh.

830
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:39,563
Do you hear that?

831
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:44,004
I used to work these hills.

832
01:00:45,893 --> 01:00:47,884
I knew this lady.

833
01:00:47,973 --> 01:00:50,533
She was out walking her little poodle.

834
01:00:52,213 --> 01:00:56,604
A coyote comes charging out,
snatches up the poodle and takes off.

835
01:00:58,293 --> 01:01:03,321
All we ever found ofthat little doggy
was its diamond-studded leash.

836
01:01:05,213 --> 01:01:08,967
When Karen first met you,
she thought you were different...

837
01:01:09,053 --> 01:01:12,284
- than her gambling father.
- What?

838
01:01:12,373 --> 01:01:14,807
It's interesting how people follow patterns.

839
01:01:15,533 --> 01:01:18,650
She doesn't feel safe with you either, Michael.

840
01:01:18,733 --> 01:01:23,090
Karen needs to feel protected
when those coyotes come charging out.

841
01:01:23,173 --> 01:01:25,482
Listen. You stay the fuck away from her...

842
01:01:25,893 --> 01:01:26,882
Ugh!

843
01:01:29,013 --> 01:01:31,004
Assaulting a police officer?

844
01:01:31,173 --> 01:01:33,846
A nice, civilised man like you, Michael?

845
01:01:33,933 --> 01:01:36,891
What are you going to do? Arrest me?

846
01:01:36,973 --> 01:01:38,964
Arrest you?

847
01:01:42,853 --> 01:01:45,287
I could kill you.

848
01:02:22,133 --> 01:02:24,124
What's wrong?

849
01:02:26,733 --> 01:02:28,724
What's going on, Karen?

850
01:02:28,813 --> 01:02:31,202
What the hell are you talking about?

851
01:02:31,293 --> 01:02:34,603
You and Pete. What's going on?

852
01:02:34,693 --> 01:02:37,446
What are you accusing me of?
We had a cup of coffee!

853
01:02:37,533 --> 01:02:39,922
It must have been a hot cup of coffee!

854
01:02:40,013 --> 01:02:45,133
He gave a talk to the kids. Ifyou think
there was anything else, you're crazy.

855
01:02:45,213 --> 01:02:47,283
I am? He just put a gun to my head.

856
01:02:47,373 --> 01:02:49,568
What?

857
01:02:49,653 --> 01:02:52,850
He just put a fucking gun to my head.
He wants you.

858
01:02:52,933 --> 01:02:55,049
He thinks you want him.

859
01:02:55,133 --> 01:02:57,772
I swear he didn't get
any ofthose ideas from me.

860
01:02:57,853 --> 01:03:00,572
He didn't pull them out ofthe air, Karen.

861
01:03:02,773 --> 01:03:05,890
So, what is it? You get off on leading him on?

862
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:08,524
Talking to him about us?

863
01:03:09,133 --> 01:03:11,124
About our marriage? Jesus!

864
01:03:12,133 --> 01:03:14,124
I told you he's dangerous.

865
01:03:14,213 --> 01:03:16,681
What's it gonna take? Me in a body bag?

866
01:03:20,133 --> 01:03:22,408
I'm sorry.

867
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:26,124
I'm sorry.

868
01:03:53,253 --> 01:03:54,971
Officer Cole.

869
01:03:55,053 --> 01:03:58,409
Your partner.
I went to him, tried to work things out.

870
01:03:58,493 --> 01:04:01,291
Didn't you know enough
to stay away from him?

871
01:04:01,373 --> 01:04:04,524
He's playing you.
Every time you react, it gets worse.

872
01:04:04,613 --> 01:04:07,286
Cops on one side,
everybody else on the other?

873
01:04:07,373 --> 01:04:10,126
Yeah. That's it.

874
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:12,488
He threatened to kill me last night.

875
01:04:12,573 --> 01:04:14,484
How should l react to that?

876
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:20,682
If anybody knows this guy is coming apart,
it's got to be you.

877
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:23,003
Come on, man. The guy's after my wife.

878
01:04:23,093 --> 01:04:25,084
I don't know where else to go.

879
01:04:38,493 --> 01:04:40,882
Come on in.

880
01:04:49,013 --> 01:04:52,528
He doesn't understand.
I'm better for her than he is.

881
01:04:52,613 --> 01:04:56,322
He doesn't love her.
He can't take care of her the way that l can.

882
01:04:56,413 --> 01:04:57,812
She needs it.

883
01:04:57,893 --> 01:05:00,123
What the hell are you going on about?

884
01:05:00,213 --> 01:05:02,124
She's never gonna be yours.

885
01:05:02,213 --> 01:05:04,852
You listen to me. Nothing...

886
01:05:04,933 --> 01:05:08,369
Nothing is ever going to happen
between you and her.

887
01:05:08,453 --> 01:05:10,921
She is some fantasy in your head.

888
01:05:11,013 --> 01:05:13,447
You don't know what you're talking about.

889
01:05:13,533 --> 01:05:15,364
- I don't, huh?
- You don't.

890
01:05:15,453 --> 01:05:19,332
You tell me what you were doing
with him the other night.

891
01:05:19,413 --> 01:05:22,291
Tell me you didn't stick a gun in his face.

892
01:05:22,373 --> 01:05:24,728
I was just playing with him.

893
01:05:24,813 --> 01:05:26,610
I'm not playing with you!

894
01:05:26,693 --> 01:05:29,002
You've got to back offthis madness.

895
01:05:29,093 --> 01:05:32,210
You've got to put in
for stress leave and see a doctor

896
01:05:32,293 --> 01:05:34,011
and get your head straight.

897
01:05:35,933 --> 01:05:37,252
Or?

898
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:42,361
Or l will go upstairs and tell them exactly
what is going on with you. Understand?

899
01:05:42,453 --> 01:05:44,364
You'd do that?

900
01:05:44,453 --> 01:05:46,125
You're goddamn right.

901
01:05:46,213 --> 01:05:48,807
And ifyou don't do it in the next 24 hours,

902
01:05:48,893 --> 01:05:50,849
that is exactly what l will do.

903
01:05:52,093 --> 01:05:54,084
Now,

904
01:05:54,173 --> 01:05:56,482
you go have coffee with a shrink.

905
01:05:57,213 --> 01:05:59,283
And it will be all right.

906
01:06:00,133 --> 01:06:01,725
You'll see.

907
01:06:39,213 --> 01:06:41,204
Would you look at that?

908
01:06:43,613 --> 01:06:45,604
Hell with it, man. Leave it.

909
01:06:46,933 --> 01:06:48,924
Leon! Freeze!

910
01:07:27,733 --> 01:07:28,563
Shit!

911
01:07:53,133 --> 01:07:54,532
Leon!

912
01:07:59,173 --> 01:08:00,083
Leon!

913
01:08:00,173 --> 01:08:02,164
Open the door!

914
01:08:08,693 --> 01:08:10,684
Put the box down!

915
01:08:10,773 --> 01:08:12,729
- It's finished.
- Put it down!

916
01:08:12,813 --> 01:08:15,646
What the hell are you making us
chase you for? Huh?

917
01:08:15,733 --> 01:08:18,201
Get over there. You know the routine.

918
01:08:18,293 --> 01:08:19,851
Spread 'em!

919
01:08:19,933 --> 01:08:21,969
You could be busting real crime.

920
01:08:22,053 --> 01:08:23,850
Yeah, l've got a benny bust.

921
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:25,924
What have we got here?

922
01:08:26,053 --> 01:08:28,362
I'm providing a service

923
01:08:28,453 --> 01:08:32,048
for those cabbies
who fall asleep behind the wheel.

924
01:08:32,133 --> 01:08:34,203
Hey! That's enough.

925
01:08:40,733 --> 01:08:44,248
I need something more than this.
Come on, Leon!

926
01:08:47,733 --> 01:08:50,930
Look what we got here.
You really are Mr Clean!

927
01:08:51,013 --> 01:08:53,527
Keep this. You might need it later on!

928
01:08:53,613 --> 01:08:56,127
Don't you believe in safe sex?

929
01:08:56,213 --> 01:08:58,932
He's got a gun! He's gonna shoot me!

930
01:09:07,693 --> 01:09:09,126
Shit...

931
01:09:09,213 --> 01:09:11,124
What are you doing?

932
01:09:13,573 --> 01:09:15,564
- What? Come on!
- Take the gun.

933
01:09:15,653 --> 01:09:18,087
No, l don't want the gun. I don't want the gun!

934
01:09:18,173 --> 01:09:20,243
- Take the gun.
- I don't want it!

935
01:09:20,333 --> 01:09:22,324
Take the gun. Go.

936
01:09:31,573 --> 01:09:33,962
You killed my partner, Leon.

937
01:09:56,253 --> 01:09:59,211
You're not going upstairs to talk to anyone.

938
01:10:41,333 --> 01:10:43,324
I went around the back.

939
01:10:46,653 --> 01:10:48,644
Roy...

940
01:10:48,733 --> 01:10:51,042
..followed the suspect in, l guess.

941
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:56,324
Then l heard shots.

942
01:10:59,933 --> 01:11:01,924
That scumbag shot Roy.

943
01:11:05,533 --> 01:11:07,524
And l guess Roy...

944
01:11:08,373 --> 01:11:11,331
..nailed him before he died.

945
01:11:50,133 --> 01:11:52,124
Wiseman, Acken and Shyer.

946
01:11:52,213 --> 01:11:54,852
This is Michael Carr.
I need to talk with Roger.

947
01:11:54,933 --> 01:11:57,527
He's out ofhis offiice. Can l take a message?

948
01:11:57,613 --> 01:12:00,605
Page him. Tell him l'm at home.
I'm being set up.

949
01:12:00,693 --> 01:12:03,082
There's cops all over my yard.

950
01:12:03,533 --> 01:12:04,761
Michael!

951
01:12:04,853 --> 01:12:06,764
Tell him to call me immediately.

952
01:12:06,853 --> 01:12:10,607
We have a warrant to search
your dwelling for narcotics.

953
01:12:11,013 --> 01:12:13,004
Please, sir. Step over here.

954
01:12:13,093 --> 01:12:15,368
An informant has given us your address

955
01:12:15,453 --> 01:12:18,923
as a residence where he purchased
narcotics from a Michael Carr.

956
01:12:19,013 --> 01:12:21,686
- This is crazy!
- Are you Michael Carr?

957
01:12:21,773 --> 01:12:23,764
Yeah.

958
01:12:49,253 --> 01:12:51,164
Surprise, surprise.

959
01:12:51,253 --> 01:12:55,883
Michael Carr, l'm placing you under arrest
for possession of narcotics.

960
01:12:55,973 --> 01:12:59,727
You have the right to remain silent
and to contact an attorney.

961
01:12:59,813 --> 01:13:01,531
If you cannot afford one...

962
01:13:01,613 --> 01:13:04,491
I'm removing your glasses
for your safety, sir.

963
01:13:04,573 --> 01:13:06,962
We'll take you down to the station now.

964
01:13:07,053 --> 01:13:10,329
We can pull a car up to the back
so your neighbours won't see.

965
01:13:10,413 --> 01:13:12,483
That's very thoughtful ofyou.

966
01:13:12,573 --> 01:13:16,168
Call Roger. Make sure you get hold of Roger.

967
01:13:40,213 --> 01:13:42,408
I'm Detective Noble. How do you do?

968
01:13:42,493 --> 01:13:46,247
I want to offer you the opportunity
to make it easy on yourself.

969
01:13:46,333 --> 01:13:50,121
If you name your connection,
you can be out of here as soon as possible.

970
01:13:50,213 --> 01:13:53,888
I'm not talking to anybody
until l speak with my lawyer.

971
01:13:54,733 --> 01:13:56,724
That's your right, Mr Carr.

972
01:14:46,533 --> 01:14:48,524
You've got ten minutes.

973
01:15:01,933 --> 01:15:03,924
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

974
01:15:04,013 --> 01:15:05,844
How's Karen?

975
01:15:05,933 --> 01:15:07,810
Hanging in there.

976
01:15:07,893 --> 01:15:09,770
Do l get to see her?

977
01:15:09,853 --> 01:15:13,846
After the arraignment.
You're only allowed legal counsel now.

978
01:15:13,933 --> 01:15:15,525
What about bail?

979
01:15:15,613 --> 01:15:17,763
That will be set at your hearing.

980
01:15:18,333 --> 01:15:20,563
What's your money situation?

981
01:15:20,653 --> 01:15:24,931
Everything l had went into the party
to impress Lurie.

982
01:15:25,013 --> 01:15:27,004
I need to know exactly.

983
01:15:30,973 --> 01:15:32,964
$2,200.

984
01:15:33,733 --> 01:15:39,365
I don't think they'll set bail too high.
It's not like you're a professional dope dealer.

985
01:15:40,693 --> 01:15:42,365
Professional?

986
01:15:43,573 --> 01:15:47,532
There was half a pound of cocaine
in your house. We've got a problem.

987
01:15:47,613 --> 01:15:48,887
My problem's simple.

988
01:15:48,973 --> 01:15:51,646
A cop wants me out ofthe way
because he wants my wife.

989
01:15:55,373 --> 01:15:57,364
Look. This is way over my head.

990
01:15:58,333 --> 01:16:02,770
I got in touch with Sam Gershon.
He's the best criminal attorney l know.

991
01:16:02,853 --> 01:16:05,128
He'll represent you at your hearing.

992
01:16:05,213 --> 01:16:09,843
You guys need to talk to Roy Cole.
Davis' partner, Officer Roy Cole.

993
01:16:09,933 --> 01:16:14,563
He told me that if anything else happened,
he'd help me out.

994
01:16:15,573 --> 01:16:17,564
Cole's dead.

995
01:16:19,773 --> 01:16:23,527
In the line of duty, in a shoot-out.
I talked to his captain.

996
01:16:29,453 --> 01:16:31,489
He won't stop until he kills me.

997
01:16:31,573 --> 01:16:33,564
Get me out of here, Roger.

998
01:16:33,653 --> 01:16:36,213
I will. It's all in hand.

999
01:16:36,293 --> 01:16:38,727
No, no, no. You listen to me.

1000
01:16:40,133 --> 01:16:42,522
Just get me out of here.

1001
01:16:42,613 --> 01:16:46,526
Case PA846059. People versus Alvarez.

1002
01:16:46,613 --> 01:16:51,129
Mr Alvarez is charged with
illegal possession of an automatic weapon

1003
01:16:51,213 --> 01:16:54,046
as set forth in the California Penal Code.

1004
01:16:54,133 --> 01:16:56,249
Is he represented by counsel?

1005
01:16:56,333 --> 01:16:57,925
He pleads innocent.

1006
01:16:58,013 --> 01:17:01,892
Nothing can be served
by his detention until trial.

1007
01:17:01,973 --> 01:17:07,411
- We request release on OR.
- Denied. Bail set at $25,000.

1008
01:17:07,493 --> 01:17:11,008
Case PA855327.

1009
01:17:11,093 --> 01:17:12,890
People versus Michael Carr.

1010
01:17:12,973 --> 01:17:17,524
Mr Carr is charged with possession
of cocaine with intent to distribute

1011
01:17:17,613 --> 01:17:23,131
as set forth in section 11351 and 11352
of the California Health and Safety Code.

1012
01:17:24,053 --> 01:17:27,329
- Is he represented by counsel?
- He pleads innocent.

1013
01:17:27,413 --> 01:17:31,088
Your Honour, he is a model citizen
who owns his own home.

1014
01:17:31,173 --> 01:17:33,164
He's in business locally.

1015
01:17:33,253 --> 01:17:37,212
His wife is a teacher
in a respected local private school.

1016
01:17:37,293 --> 01:17:39,363
We request bail on OR.

1017
01:17:39,893 --> 01:17:45,525
Your Honour, it's come to our attention
that Mr Carr pled out a similar case in Texas.

1018
01:17:53,333 --> 01:17:55,324
What about this?

1019
01:17:55,413 --> 01:17:57,404
It wasn't me.

1020
01:17:57,493 --> 01:17:59,723
I took an investor out on the town.

1021
01:17:59,813 --> 01:18:03,567
The guy had a vial of blow in his pocket
and stuck it under the car seat.

1022
01:18:03,653 --> 01:18:07,487
A lawyer told me the easiest thing
to do was plead it out, so...

1023
01:18:07,573 --> 01:18:09,962
- But it wasn't me.
- It doesn't matter.

1024
01:18:10,053 --> 01:18:12,521
You took the deal, it's on the record.

1025
01:18:14,173 --> 01:18:18,963
This OR is denied. Bail is set at $250,000.

1026
01:18:19,053 --> 01:18:24,207
Case PA861288. People versus Jenkins.

1027
01:18:24,293 --> 01:18:26,682
Mr Jenkins is charged with felony

1028
01:18:26,773 --> 01:18:30,049
as set forth in section 4873
of the California Penal Code.

1029
01:18:30,133 --> 01:18:33,682
Mr Jenkins pleads not guilty, Your Honour...

1030
01:18:48,533 --> 01:18:50,808
Having trouble making bail, Mike?

1031
01:18:50,893 --> 01:18:52,884
Money's a little tight, huh?

1032
01:18:55,013 --> 01:18:57,004
Karen's really upset.

1033
01:18:57,093 --> 01:19:00,768
You really shouldn't have done this to her.

1034
01:19:02,533 --> 01:19:04,524
She's all alone now.

1035
01:19:05,693 --> 01:19:07,684
But don't worry, not for long.

1036
01:19:13,733 --> 01:19:16,930
I want you to know
that she's gonna be taken care of.

1037
01:19:17,013 --> 01:19:19,004
I know what Karen needs.

1038
01:19:20,293 --> 01:19:23,205
And isn't it her happiness that we both want?

1039
01:19:23,293 --> 01:19:25,284
Hmm?

1040
01:19:28,773 --> 01:19:31,526
If you could find us,
why don't you look us up?

1041
01:19:31,613 --> 01:19:34,252
I'd love to have you over for a barbecue.

1042
01:19:34,333 --> 01:19:36,324
If you go near her,

1043
01:19:38,373 --> 01:19:40,329
I'll kill you.

1044
01:19:44,933 --> 01:19:46,924
So long, Mikey.

1045
01:19:52,053 --> 01:19:54,044
You look good in blue!

1046
01:20:08,533 --> 01:20:11,206
- Hey.
- Hi.

1047
01:20:11,293 --> 01:20:12,965
How are you doing?

1048
01:20:13,053 --> 01:20:15,283
I'm fine. I'm just a little tired.

1049
01:20:15,973 --> 01:20:17,452
There you are!

1050
01:20:17,533 --> 01:20:19,524
I thought he might be hungry.

1051
01:20:19,613 --> 01:20:21,649
- Thanks.
- How about you?

1052
01:20:21,733 --> 01:20:24,088
I could use something, yeah.

1053
01:20:24,173 --> 01:20:26,164
Good.

1054
01:20:26,253 --> 01:20:28,130
Penny...

1055
01:20:28,213 --> 01:20:30,204
I'm really glad you're here.

1056
01:20:30,293 --> 01:20:33,410
It's no problem.
I'll stay till Michael gets home.

1057
01:20:33,493 --> 01:20:35,211
It's gonna be a while.

1058
01:20:35,293 --> 01:20:38,763
That's OK. Get some rest.

1059
01:20:39,773 --> 01:20:41,764
Guard!

1060
01:20:41,853 --> 01:20:43,844
Make a telephone call!

1061
01:20:45,933 --> 01:20:47,924
Guard!

1062
01:20:48,533 --> 01:20:51,605
Guard! Thanks, man.
Can l make a telephone call?

1063
01:20:51,693 --> 01:20:54,366
Guard! Make a telephone call?

1064
01:20:54,453 --> 01:20:55,203
Shut up!

1065
01:20:58,773 --> 01:21:01,651
You're just a fat little piggy, aren't you?

1066
01:21:10,453 --> 01:21:12,444
There you go.

1067
01:21:14,413 --> 01:21:16,608
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

1068
01:21:16,693 --> 01:21:17,967
Pete?

1069
01:21:18,053 --> 01:21:20,647
Karen's upstairs. She's got a headache.

1070
01:21:20,733 --> 01:21:22,724
Oh.

1071
01:21:22,813 --> 01:21:24,929
I've brought some groceries

1072
01:21:25,013 --> 01:21:28,926
in case she didn't have time
after everything that's been going on.

1073
01:21:29,013 --> 01:21:30,651
I'll tell her you came by.

1074
01:21:31,733 --> 01:21:33,883
Why don't l just give them to you?

1075
01:21:33,973 --> 01:21:36,043
I gotta get going to work, so...

1076
01:21:42,053 --> 01:21:44,965
I'm not very popular here, am l, Penny?

1077
01:21:46,533 --> 01:21:47,966
All right.

1078
01:21:48,053 --> 01:21:50,283
I'll just leave them here.

1079
01:21:50,373 --> 01:21:52,409
You can get them...

1080
01:21:52,493 --> 01:21:54,484
You can get them later.

1081
01:21:55,133 --> 01:21:56,930
Take care.

1082
01:21:57,013 --> 01:21:59,322
You look great. I'll see you later.

1083
01:22:00,133 --> 01:22:02,124
Bye.

1084
01:23:00,213 --> 01:23:02,204
250. That's a hard bullet.

1085
01:23:02,293 --> 01:23:04,363
You're looking at $25K, Mr Graham.

1086
01:23:04,453 --> 01:23:06,444
Here's the deed to my house.

1087
01:23:08,093 --> 01:23:11,529
This takes care ofthe bail,
but what about my premium?

1088
01:23:11,613 --> 01:23:14,207
I'm writing you a $25,000 personal cheque.

1089
01:23:14,293 --> 01:23:16,090
That's a nice Rolex.

1090
01:23:16,173 --> 01:23:19,449
Forget the watch. Sam Gershon
said you'd take care of me.

1091
01:23:19,533 --> 01:23:22,809
This should be a cashier's cheque,
but you're a friend of Sam.

1092
01:23:22,893 --> 01:23:25,202
If the bank says you've got funds, OK.

1093
01:23:27,533 --> 01:23:30,172
Touch-tone phones, you don't have that?

1094
01:24:01,853 --> 01:24:05,243
All right. Can l make that phone call now?
Please?

1095
01:24:05,333 --> 01:24:08,882
It would just take a second.
I'd really appreciate it.

1096
01:24:08,973 --> 01:24:10,964
Talk to you when l can.

1097
01:24:21,013 --> 01:24:23,402
- Operator.
- A collect, from Michael.

1098
01:24:23,493 --> 01:24:25,006
One moment.

1099
01:24:41,093 --> 01:24:44,642
I'm sorry, sir.
The phone mustbe offthe hook.

1100
01:24:44,733 --> 01:24:48,009
Can you cut in or something?
This is an emergency.

1101
01:24:48,093 --> 01:24:49,242
I did that, sir.

1102
01:24:49,333 --> 01:24:52,211
Can you help me?
l won't get to a phone again.

1103
01:24:52,293 --> 01:24:56,206
It's a machine, l can't tellit what to do.
I can reportit...

1104
01:24:56,293 --> 01:24:59,365
- Are you sure it's offthe hook?
- Yes, sir, itis.

1105
01:25:11,533 --> 01:25:13,842
Penny, it smells so good!

1106
01:25:13,933 --> 01:25:16,083
I didn't know cooking was one ofyour...

1107
01:25:16,613 --> 01:25:18,205
Hi.

1108
01:25:18,293 --> 01:25:20,853
Are you feeling better?

1109
01:25:22,133 --> 01:25:24,124
I got some erm...

1110
01:25:24,213 --> 01:25:27,205
..mushrooms, onions, dried tomatoes,

1111
01:25:28,013 --> 01:25:30,004
parsley.

1112
01:25:30,093 --> 01:25:33,085
- Where's Penny?
- Penny?

1113
01:25:33,173 --> 01:25:35,164
Erm...

1114
01:25:35,253 --> 01:25:37,244
I told her to go home.

1115
01:25:39,013 --> 01:25:41,004
She'd just be a third wheel.

1116
01:25:56,133 --> 01:25:59,364
I took the phone offthe hook
so you could sleep

1117
01:25:59,453 --> 01:26:01,364
and have no distractions.

1118
01:26:01,453 --> 01:26:03,444
I'm not sleeping now, am l?

1119
01:26:03,533 --> 01:26:05,524
I want you to leave.

1120
01:26:05,613 --> 01:26:07,365
Wait.

1121
01:26:07,453 --> 01:26:09,444
I know l shouldn't be here.

1122
01:26:09,533 --> 01:26:11,683
I know you're upset.

1123
01:26:11,773 --> 01:26:14,082
But let's stop kidding ourselves, Karen.

1124
01:26:14,173 --> 01:26:17,290
We've bent over backwards
to do the right thing.

1125
01:26:17,373 --> 01:26:20,445
You playing the perfect wife,
me the good friend.

1126
01:26:20,533 --> 01:26:23,491
I can't take it any more, l just can't.

1127
01:26:24,493 --> 01:26:26,529
Now we can stop pretending.

1128
01:26:27,453 --> 01:26:29,444
We can stop pretending now.

1129
01:26:29,533 --> 01:26:31,603
Pete, l'm very tired.

1130
01:26:31,693 --> 01:26:35,288
I... I need some time alone.
I've got to be by myself.

1131
01:26:35,373 --> 01:26:37,364
I know, l know. I understand.

1132
01:26:40,453 --> 01:26:42,205
Come here. Sit down.

1133
01:26:43,493 --> 01:26:45,484
Sit down.

1134
01:26:45,573 --> 01:26:47,564
I know what's scaring you.

1135
01:26:48,733 --> 01:26:50,325
Listen.

1136
01:26:50,413 --> 01:26:52,483
I don't have to be a cop any more.

1137
01:26:54,693 --> 01:26:57,730
OK? l could do something different
with my life.

1138
01:26:58,613 --> 01:27:00,604
Something clean.

1139
01:27:01,813 --> 01:27:04,122
I think that's good.

1140
01:27:04,213 --> 01:27:08,047
No-one should have to live their life
the way you have been.

1141
01:27:08,133 --> 01:27:11,443
You wouldn't have to carry a gun any more.

1142
01:27:14,133 --> 01:27:16,124
Why don't you put it away? Hmm?

1143
01:27:25,373 --> 01:27:27,568
No gun. No badge.

1144
01:27:36,133 --> 01:27:38,522
I'd better go cook.

1145
01:27:42,173 --> 01:27:44,164
- Pete...
- What?

1146
01:27:44,253 --> 01:27:46,244
I forgot about Tiny.

1147
01:27:48,173 --> 01:27:50,164
The cat!

1148
01:27:50,253 --> 01:27:53,051
I don't like leaving him outside at night.

1149
01:27:56,693 --> 01:27:58,445
OK.

1150
01:27:58,533 --> 01:28:00,251
I'll be right back.

1151
01:28:39,333 --> 01:28:41,130
Karen!

1152
01:28:53,373 --> 01:28:55,011
You got him.

1153
01:28:56,493 --> 01:28:58,484
Yeah.

1154
01:29:02,293 --> 01:29:04,284
Hey, Tiny.

1155
01:29:09,053 --> 01:29:11,044
- Are you OK?
- Mm-hm.

1156
01:29:12,333 --> 01:29:13,925
Yeah.

1157
01:29:17,533 --> 01:29:19,524
Are you sure?

1158
01:29:19,613 --> 01:29:21,604
Mm-hm.

1159
01:29:21,973 --> 01:29:24,692
- You're really tense.
- I am a little bit.

1160
01:29:27,133 --> 01:29:29,203
Come here. I know what you need.

1161
01:29:29,293 --> 01:29:31,284
Come here. It's OK, come on.

1162
01:29:48,853 --> 01:29:51,321
- Move over.
- Move over?

1163
01:29:51,413 --> 01:29:53,005
Come on, let's go.

1164
01:29:53,093 --> 01:29:54,811
Go ahead, take my car!

1165
01:29:54,893 --> 01:29:57,009
I already put up my house to get you out.

1166
01:29:57,093 --> 01:29:58,492
Put on your seat belt.

1167
01:30:11,853 --> 01:30:14,811
You keep all your tension in your shoulders.

1168
01:30:17,133 --> 01:30:19,124
All up here.

1169
01:30:19,213 --> 01:30:21,204
Just relax.

1170
01:30:23,613 --> 01:30:25,604
Just relax.

1171
01:30:27,053 --> 01:30:29,044
Breathe.

1172
01:30:40,493 --> 01:30:43,053
I feel so lucky being alone here with you.

1173
01:30:47,253 --> 01:30:50,290
Tell me how much you love me.

1174
01:30:50,373 --> 01:30:53,490
It will never be as much as l love you.

1175
01:30:56,253 --> 01:30:58,244
Pete, don't.

1176
01:30:59,133 --> 01:31:01,124
Don't what?

1177
01:31:01,693 --> 01:31:03,684
Don't what?

1178
01:31:03,773 --> 01:31:06,082
I don't feel very pretty right now.

1179
01:31:06,533 --> 01:31:09,366
Karen, you're beautiful.

1180
01:31:10,373 --> 01:31:11,488
No.

1181
01:31:14,373 --> 01:31:16,364
I want to look better.

1182
01:31:18,693 --> 01:31:21,366
I want to put on something nice for you,

1183
01:31:21,453 --> 01:31:23,523
something that you'll like.

1184
01:31:31,973 --> 01:31:33,964
I'll call you when l'm ready.

1185
01:31:36,093 --> 01:31:38,084
Don't be long.

1186
01:31:39,653 --> 01:31:40,768
Slow down!

1187
01:31:40,853 --> 01:31:42,969
We won't make it.

1188
01:31:43,053 --> 01:31:45,362
You can't make it! Michael, no!

1189
01:31:46,413 --> 01:31:47,732
Jesus!

1190
01:32:06,933 --> 01:32:08,605
Karen.

1191
01:32:08,693 --> 01:32:11,127
Are you looking for this?

1192
01:32:13,853 --> 01:32:15,844
Yeah, you read my mind.

1193
01:32:15,933 --> 01:32:18,493
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1194
01:32:18,573 --> 01:32:21,849
I hate the damn thing.
I wanted you to get rid of it.

1195
01:32:24,893 --> 01:32:27,248
I thought you were gonna get changed.

1196
01:32:50,173 --> 01:32:51,322
Fuck!

1197
01:32:53,653 --> 01:32:55,325
Hang on.

1198
01:33:07,173 --> 01:33:09,164
Don't shoot, l'm a lawyer.

1199
01:35:13,133 --> 01:35:14,725
Get out!

1200
01:35:14,813 --> 01:35:16,405
What are you doing?

1201
01:35:16,493 --> 01:35:19,769
You're a sick fucking brutal asshole! Get out!

1202
01:35:20,813 --> 01:35:22,804
You're not gonna to shoot me.

1203
01:35:22,893 --> 01:35:26,408
- I swear l'll kill you.
- You're not gonna kill anyone.

1204
01:35:26,493 --> 01:35:28,688
You know that this is right.

1205
01:35:28,773 --> 01:35:30,445
Get away!

1206
01:35:30,533 --> 01:35:32,251
Now, put the gun down.

1207
01:35:32,333 --> 01:35:35,052
Put the gun down.

1208
01:35:39,733 --> 01:35:42,122
Try it again. Shoot again.

1209
01:35:42,973 --> 01:35:45,806
Do you think l'd give you
a loaded fucking gun! Huh?

1210
01:35:48,173 --> 01:35:50,289
See how things are now, huh?

You little cock-teaser!

1213

You wanna shoot me?

1214
01:35:58,373 --> 01:36:00,364
You know what you are, Karen?

1215
01:36:00,453 --> 01:36:02,444
You're a little fucking whore!

1216
01:36:02,533 --> 01:36:06,731
You're a worthless whore, just like
every fucking whore l've ever met.

1217
01:36:06,853 --> 01:36:11,643
That's exactly what l'm going to treat you like.

1218
01:36:12,213 --> 01:36:14,204
Get them fucking open!

1219
01:36:14,293 --> 01:36:17,922
I'm gonna treat you like a whore, Karen!

1220
01:36:56,533 --> 01:36:57,966
Shit!

1221
01:37:01,933 --> 01:37:03,685
No!

1222
01:37:05,373 --> 01:37:07,011
Michael!

1223
01:37:07,093 --> 01:37:09,084
He found your gun.

1224
01:37:12,973 --> 01:37:15,282
I gotta get you out ofthis house!

1225
01:37:46,573 --> 01:37:48,211
Aaagh!

1226
01:38:12,013 --> 01:38:14,163

1227
01:38:58,133 --> 01:38:59,532
Hello.

1228
01:39:01,293 --> 01:39:03,284
Yeah, this is Michael Carr.

1229
01:39:03,373 --> 01:39:05,091
Thank you for calling.

1230
01:39:05,173 --> 01:39:08,529
I was swinging a golf club
and it went though the...

1231
01:39:08,613 --> 01:39:11,127
It went through the patio window.

1232
01:39:11,213 --> 01:39:14,410
It's OK. There's glass everywhere, but it's OK.

1233
01:39:15,413 --> 01:39:17,449
Yeah, the password's pyramid.

1234
01:39:21,933 --> 01:39:23,525
No.

1235
01:39:23,613 --> 01:39:25,843
No, l did not change the password.

1236
01:39:25,933 --> 01:39:28,163
I did.

1237
01:39:31,493 --> 01:39:33,484
What's the password?

1238
01:39:33,573 --> 01:39:35,564
Figure it out, asshole.

1239
01:39:36,173 --> 01:39:38,164
Seven letters.

1240
01:39:38,253 --> 01:39:40,130
Fuck you!

1241
01:39:43,293 --> 01:39:45,966
This is going to cost you, Michael.

1242
01:39:49,293 --> 01:39:51,284
Come on, get up here.

1243
01:39:53,533 --> 01:39:55,524
Karen!

1244
01:39:56,453 --> 01:39:58,250
Karen! This is the way it is.

1245
01:39:58,333 --> 01:40:01,484
We've got two minutes
to get in my car and get out of here.

1246
01:40:01,573 --> 01:40:05,088
Do you hear?
lf you don't open the door, Michael dies.

1247
01:40:05,173 --> 01:40:08,006
- Understand?
- He'll kill you, too. Stay there.

1248
01:40:08,093 --> 01:40:10,368
- Just shut up.
- Don't come out!

1249
01:40:10,453 --> 01:40:14,446
- Karen, don't fuck around.
- He'll shoot me anyway.

1250
01:40:14,533 --> 01:40:18,811
I won't kill him. Open the door
and l'll let Michael live, l swear.

1251
01:40:18,893 --> 01:40:21,202
If you don't, your husband's dead.

1252
01:40:21,293 --> 01:40:23,363
OK, Karen? That's the way it is.

1253
01:40:23,453 --> 01:40:25,250
I'm giving you a count ofthree.

1254
01:40:25,333 --> 01:40:27,005
One,

1255
01:40:27,093 --> 01:40:29,084
two...

1256
01:40:29,173 --> 01:40:31,323
Pull the trigger, you son of a bitch!

1257
01:40:35,853 --> 01:40:36,842
Karen!

1258
01:40:36,933 --> 01:40:39,367
Karen, don't open the fucking door!

1259
01:42:23,013 --> 01:42:24,366
Michael!

1260
01:42:24,453 --> 01:42:26,444
What are you going to do, tough guy?

1261
01:42:26,533 --> 01:42:29,570
Are you going to make a citizen's arrest?

1262
01:42:29,653 --> 01:42:31,644
Arrest you?

1263
01:42:33,853 --> 01:42:34,888
Aaagh!
