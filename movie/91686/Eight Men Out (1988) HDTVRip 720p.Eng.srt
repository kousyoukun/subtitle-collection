1
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,701
Bucky!

2
00:02:52,206 --> 00:02:53,810
Bucky!

3
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,455
Bucky!

4
00:02:59,447 --> 00:03:00,824
Bucky!

5
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:05,896
I got it, Bucky! We're in!

6
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,196
I got me the 2 bits!
We're in!

7
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:09,428
How'd you get it?

8
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:11,960
Hawking papers.
C'mon, it's starting!

9
00:03:11,993 --> 00:03:14,599
We're going to see the Sox!

10
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:22,842
Two bleachers.
- Two bleachers.

11
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,213
Thank you.

12
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:25,410
Three, please.

13
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,853
Safe!

14
00:03:32,914 --> 00:03:35,087
We'll divvy it up.
Two makes heavy dough.

15
00:03:35,116 --> 00:03:38,063
These are the best seats in the joint!
- You bet!

16
00:03:46,861 --> 00:03:49,278
If Cicotte's arm holds up it will be murder.

17
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,204
Better get movin', boys.
Commy's forum is in the clubhouse.

18
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:57,046
Commy sure knows the way to a writer's heart.
- Sports writers of the world, unite!

19
00:03:57,071 --> 00:04:00,018
You have nothing to lose
but your bar privileges.

20
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,816
Here comes the old Roman.

21
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:05,255
Hello, my boys! Everybody happy?

22
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:06,758
Hi, Billy!

23
00:04:06,781 --> 00:04:09,125
Tommy! Smitty!

24
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,458
Hey, sourpuss.

25
00:04:11,853 --> 00:04:12,959
So, Hughie?

26
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:16,259
- Ban Johnson says he's pretty sure
your boys are going to win.

27
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,861
No question <i>if</i>  my boys will win.

28
00:04:18,893 --> 00:04:21,134
Just a matter of how many games
it's going to take 'em.

29
00:04:21,162 --> 00:04:22,573
Think it'll go the full nine?

30
00:04:22,597 --> 00:04:25,077
Nine games? Not a chance.

31
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:26,908
You sound pretty cocky.

32
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:31,110
I got the horses, Smitty.
I got the horses.

33
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:35,086
And, more than that,
I got the team, fellas!

34
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:37,614
Kid Gleason has done a heck of
a job at the helm this year,

35
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:39,114
bringing these boys together.

36
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:42,150
Smoothing out the defense.
Building up the offense.

37
00:04:42,183 --> 00:04:45,027
Getting the boys to think and move together.

38
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:47,498
Hell! They eat together, travel together,

39
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:49,159
room together on the road

40
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,533
and when it's time to play
they let off steam together.

41
00:04:50,558 --> 00:04:53,164
No room for prima donnas in this ball club!

42
00:04:53,194 --> 00:04:56,107
Every man for the good of the team!

43
00:05:00,735 --> 00:05:01,939
Out!

44
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,571
You're out!

45
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:09,680
That one wake you up, Collins?

46
00:05:10,845 --> 00:05:14,156
Hey, "college boy" needs his beauty sleep.

47
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:16,427
What for?
He goes to bed at 9:00 o'clock.

48
00:05:16,461 --> 00:05:18,653
Wouldn't hurt you guys
to get a little sleep once in a while.

49
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:20,393
Shove it, "college boy".

50
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:22,264
It's like a family, ya know?

51
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:23,996
What about the odds on your boys?

52
00:05:24,025 --> 00:05:27,234
It's already 3 to 1 in their favor.

53
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:30,936
They are... underestimating us.

54
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:38,712
Any bet against my Sox this series
is a sucker bet.

55
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:40,412
Of course, I'm not a gambling man.

56
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:46,689
Collins?
- Nah.

57
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:50,127
"College boy" is the only one on the club
who's getting paid what he's worth.

58
00:05:50,151 --> 00:05:53,047
Tied it in his contract
when he got traded.

59
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:56,966
C'mon... Go!

60
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:07,946
Hey, mister! Hey, mister!
You made my brother spill his Cracker Jacks!

61
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:09,811
Mister!

62
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:12,317
- Here, kid. Shut him up, will ya?

63
00:06:15,643 --> 00:06:17,645
- What about Chick Gandil?

64
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,121
He might do business.

65
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:23,958
Chickie's a sport.

66
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:27,022
Gandil? Only first sack in the league
doesn't need his glove to play.

67
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:28,965
Hands of steel.

68
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:30,764
I'll put my Joe Jackson...

69
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,964
up against any player in the circuit.

70
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:36,668
The boy can hit...
he can run... he can throw.

71
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:38,836
- If he could read he'd be perfect.

72
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:43,138
C'mon, Betsy, it needs a walk now.
Big walk.

73
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,116
Tell me when, Betsy.

74
00:06:46,107 --> 00:06:47,780
Does it ever talk back to you, Joe?

75
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,219
- He probably sleeps with it, too.

76
00:06:53,047 --> 00:06:54,583
Lay off, you guys.

77
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:56,686
Ah, you crackers stick together, huh?

78
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:58,390
- Ask him for a triple, Joe.

79
00:06:58,419 --> 00:06:59,489
Did you hear me?

80
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,400
Sixty years since the civil war, Lefty.
Ease up.

81
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:05,995
Besides, you guys lost.
It's in all the papers.

82
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:07,903
That wouldn't help Jackson, though.

83
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:10,498
Just leave 'em be.

84
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:16,014
What are you lookin' at, busher?

85
00:07:20,975 --> 00:07:22,613
Here he comes!

86
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:24,714
C'mon, Joe! Nail it!

87
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,882
- Hey, professor...

88
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:29,724
read any good books lately?

89
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:32,764
- Hey, professor...!

90
00:07:41,996 --> 00:07:43,304
Run, Joe, run!

91
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,105
C'mon go, go, go!

92
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:51,616
C'mon, take it!

93
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,346
C'mon, Joe, slide!

94
00:07:53,374 --> 00:07:54,580
Safe!

95
00:07:54,878 --> 00:07:58,556
Whoopee!
Whoopee! Way to go, Joe!

96
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:02,684
- Hey, Jackson! Hey, Jackson!

97
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:04,059
Can you spell "Cat"?

98
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:09,662
C'mon "Shoeless Joe",
can you spell "Cat"?

99
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,967
Hey, mister, can you spell "Shit"?

100
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,904
Buck Weaver?

101
00:08:20,935 --> 00:08:22,608
Bucky is one of the boys.

102
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:26,140
But, the thing about Bucky is
he don't like to lose.

103
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,846
Everyone's standing up!

104
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,081
Here.

105
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,619
C'mon, Buck! Repeat Joe's!

106
00:08:41,322 --> 00:08:42,596
Out!

107
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:48,305
He can't stand to lose.
Put him on the "maybe list".

108
00:08:50,231 --> 00:08:51,801
What about Schalk?

109
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:53,402
- Not a prayer.

110
00:08:53,434 --> 00:08:56,074
Listen, Ray, settle a bet
between me and Hap, will ya?

111
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:59,016
He says everybody knows how to smile.
Even you.

112
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:03,078
And I said your puss would crack
if you ever tried.

113
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,112
Go piss up a rope.

114
00:09:09,183 --> 00:09:11,993
OK, Eddie! C'mon, ball five, Eddie!

115
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:13,726
Ball five. Here we go, Eddie!

116
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:16,530
- Eddie Cicotte has had
his control back this year.

117
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,867
And I think his record speaks for itself.

118
00:09:18,893 --> 00:09:23,273
I wouldn't be surprised if he's got two,
maybe three good seasons left in that arm.

119
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:34,377
Foul ball!

120
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:41,753
C'mon, Eddie. Let's make a lot of noise.
Let's just make a lot of noise, Eddie!

121
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:43,125
C'mon, get it in here, Eddie.

122
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:46,290
Here we go. Here we go, Eddie.

123
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,130
C'mon, fast as you can, Eddie!

124
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:50,760
Let's get it. Let's get it!

125
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:01,742
Foul ball!

126
00:10:04,138 --> 00:10:06,976
C'mon, Knuckles.
Don't make me nervous.

127
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,414
Keep it down there.
Keep it down there, Eddie!

128
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:12,151
Hey, frag arm! Frag arm!

129
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:15,388
Hey, old man! Get a rockin' chair!

130
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:17,760
OK, Eddie, one more strike.
Don't worry about it!

131
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:19,389
Their luck is running thin.

132
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,457
Pitch it right in there!
One more ace, c'mon!

133
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:23,434
OK, let's do it, Eddie!

134
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:25,403
Big five, Eddie.

135
00:10:25,426 --> 00:10:28,270
Here we go! Big five, Eddie!

136
00:10:30,898 --> 00:10:32,377
Strike three!

137
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,879
50 years of baseball.

138
00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:37,678
He's got the best knuckle ball
I've ever seen.

139
00:10:37,705 --> 00:10:41,607
If he's such a fan why doesn't he
pay him a living wage?

140
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,412
Eddie's getting old for this game.

141
00:10:44,445 --> 00:10:48,188
I know the feeling when you walk
out on the mound with your arm hanging.

142
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:51,924
You couldn't pitch
when you were young, Burnsy.

143
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:55,559
Eddie is the key.
We don't get Eddie, we forget about it.

144
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:57,159
- OK, Eddie, let's finish 'em off here now!

145
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:14,475
We're going to the series!

146
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:20,651
A guy could knock his brains out doing that.

147
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:22,058
What brains?

148
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:25,894
"Shoeless Joe" is ignorant.
Hap Felsch is dumb.

149
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:30,799
Jesus, Hap. Save it, will ya?

150
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:32,701
Save it for what?

151
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:47,375
- Stay hungry, you guys.

152
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:56,086
Uh, what's the scoop, Harry?

153
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:58,596
Mr. Comiskey sent these down to you.

154
00:11:58,619 --> 00:12:01,657
His congratulations
for a successful pennant race.

155
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:03,599
Ah, that's white of him.

156
00:12:03,624 --> 00:12:05,630
He didn't happen to mention when

157
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:08,630
we could expect that bonus he promised us
if we took the flag, did he?

158
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,407
This is your bonus.

159
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:18,114
Cheap bastard.

160
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,352
Fellows, if it was up to me --
- Kid, we got no beef with you.

161
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:28,852
It's flat.

162
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:36,660
To the old Roman,
Charles Comiskey.

163
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,068
To Commy! To Commy!
- Beat their pants off, Commy.

164
00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:41,164
To the Sox!

165
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:49,013
Hey, Buck.

166
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:56,554
- Hey, Winslow.

167
00:12:56,577 --> 00:12:57,647
Gentlemen.

168
00:12:57,678 --> 00:13:00,056
Winslow, your boys look sharp.
- Yeah.

169
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,254
They're the best I've seen yet.

170
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:06,492
The best white folks team, anyways.

171
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,195
I say they're the best, Hughie.
The best ever.

172
00:13:10,224 --> 00:13:12,334
Time will tell, kid.

173
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:14,765
Time will tell.

174
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:18,074
C'mon, fellas,
pretend this is Commy's wake.

187
00:13:54,268 --> 00:13:57,147
Don't want me to skip and
find what they talk about you?

188
00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:59,048
Start from the beginning, baby.

189
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:01,814
"Now that we have
put the Hun in his place

190
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:06,723
it is time for Americans to turn their
attentions to more pleasurable pastimes".

191
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:12,794
Hey, they're sayin' we got no bench.

192
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:14,298
That's you they're talking about.

193
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:17,029
- Hey, if Gleason puts me on,
I'm gonna put a hole through them Reds.

194
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:19,628
Yeah? You going to fart at 'em
or swing a bat?

195
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:22,903
Hey, wise guy. Pow!

196
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,967
Hey, Freddie got
the best hands in the league.

197
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:28,172
I never once seen him drop a mug of beer
once he's got his mitts on it.

198
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:31,240
Look at the way he fits this stool.

199
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:35,481
That's a professional bench warmer's butt
if ever I've seen one.

200
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:38,149
I hear you're quite a performer, Mr. Gandil.

201
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:42,251
Yeah. I ain't bad on the diamond, neither.

202
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:45,593
They say you don't even
need a glove to catch a ball.

203
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:47,656
Let me see your hands.

204
00:14:47,688 --> 00:14:49,690
Look at them mitts, ladies.

205
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:52,067
You should have been a pug, Chickie,
with mitts like that.

206
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:54,470
Oh, I done some scrappin'.

207
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:01,004
- Spiffy lookin' bird is "Sport" Sullivan.

208
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:03,878
Anything that moves in Boston,
he's got a bet down on it.

209
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:05,406
Think he's beat us to it?

210
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,785
Nah. He's just fishing around
for some inside dope, is all.

211
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,952
- My nose is broke...

212
00:15:13,981 --> 00:15:17,793
my eyes is swelled up so bad
I can't hardly see.

213
00:15:17,818 --> 00:15:21,288
And somehow I bust the guy square
with this upper cut.

214
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:22,891
He goes down.

215
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:26,894
Somebody shoves 50 bucks in my hand.
50 bucks!

216
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:30,739
I'm stepping on something
and it's the other guy's teeth.

217
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,869
"What's he get?", I say.

218
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:35,537
Referee kneels over the guy and he says,

219
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:39,881
"From the look of his jaw,
he gets a liquid diet for 6 weeks".

220
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,747
Now, what we should have done...

221
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,316
was waltz around for a few rounds...

222
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:51,329
then one of us takes a turn

223
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:53,797
and we split 25 bucks apiece later on.

224
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,857
And nobody gets hurt.

225
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:00,262
Chickie is smart money.

226
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:03,366
Whenever I'm in town,
he's the man I see.

227
00:16:03,397 --> 00:16:07,971
- If you don't play the angles,
you're a sap.

228
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:16,280
Say, why don't you ladies
go powder your noses for awhile?

229
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,716
The way I figure it
that son of a bitch Comiskey's

230
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,816
the only one that's going to
make a killing on this deal.

231
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:23,157
It's his ball club, his stadium.

232
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:25,459
His grass, his dirt, his air.

233
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,487
In fact, Commy owns you, Buck.

234
00:16:27,521 --> 00:16:30,661
I'm surprised he ain't got you all
doing yard work for him in the off season.

235
00:16:30,691 --> 00:16:32,466
Nobody owns me.

236
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,470
- That's a laugh.

237
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:34,995
Claude?

238
00:16:35,028 --> 00:16:36,530
You're getting paged, Lefty.

239
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:39,869
It's time, Claude. You promised.

240
00:16:49,943 --> 00:16:53,356
Gleason caught him sneaking back
at the Cruxie one night in Philly.

241
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,223
Asked him what his wife would think

242
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:57,125
and he said that's who he'd gone to see.

243
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,187
His own wife on the road?

244
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,728
Pitiful.

245
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:04,836
Just supposing...?

246
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,337
Yes--

247
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,738
You'd need at least 2 starting pitchers...

248
00:17:08,762 --> 00:17:11,368
a couple of infielders...

249
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:14,106
a couple of heavy hitters.

250
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:16,842
I mean, if you really want to be sure.

251
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,907
What about the Sox?

252
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,916
Six, maybe seven, they'd go for it.

253
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:30,252
I'd say you'd need at least 10,000 apiece.

254
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:34,060
Of course, who could put
that kind of money together?

255
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:35,725
I could.

256
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:41,998
You go back to Boston and
turn 70,000 at the drop of a hat?

257
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:44,235
I find that hard to believe.

258
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:46,642
You say you can find seven men

259
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,805
on the best club
that ever took the field

260
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:52,044
willing to throw the world series?

261
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:54,484
I find <i>that</i>  hard to believe

262
00:17:54,508 --> 00:17:57,717
You never played with Charlie Comiskey.

263
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:07,322
♫ <i>I see you flirt
with some frail skirt</i>

264
00:18:07,354 --> 00:18:12,303
♫ <i>And I'm in a purple rage</i>

265
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:15,795
♫ <i>White hot passion's</i>

266
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:18,503
♫ <i>Been the fashion</i>

267
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:23,277
♫ <i>Since the old golden days</i>... ♫♫

268
00:18:23,804 --> 00:18:27,547
It would take 4 seasons
sweating it out for Commy to make 10,000.

269
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:31,021
Now, if we did get an advance,
put it down on the Reds...

270
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:34,116
It gets heavy odds--
it starts to multiply.

271
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:36,457
Just a couple of games we're talking,
or the whole series?

272
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:38,690
That's one thing that
we'd have to work out.

273
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:40,925
Now, the way I figure it--

274
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:43,765
Hey, guys.

275
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,269
Damn!

276
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,396
Freddie...

277
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:52,308
You oughtn't creep around like that, pal.
You made Chick wet his pants.

278
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:53,640
How about letting me in?

279
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:56,218
In what? What are you talking about?

280
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:59,059
Whatever you guys got goin'.

281
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:00,393
The fix.

282
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,299
You're in, Freddie.
- What?

283
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:06,871
You want in, Freddie? You're in.

284
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:09,816
Now, if you can just
leave us alone here...

285
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,830
we've got some things to iron out.

286
00:19:11,932 --> 00:19:14,248
Sure, Swede.

287
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:15,288
Freddie.

288
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:17,179
Keep a lid on it, eh?

289
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:20,603
Sure, Swede. You know me.

290
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:26,673
Listen.
I know he's your buddy and all, but--

291
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,407
- He's in.

292
00:19:28,435 --> 00:19:31,882
Swede, hey.
He's not even going to play.

293
00:19:31,905 --> 00:19:34,852
Chick... He's in.

294
00:19:38,945 --> 00:19:41,949
Okay, he's in.

295
00:19:41,982 --> 00:19:43,586
What next?

296
00:19:43,617 --> 00:19:47,326
Chick Gandil! Hey, long time no see!

297
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:50,392
Bill Burns. Remember me?

298
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:54,031
Oh yeah. Right, yeah.

299
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:58,440
Listen, Chick, long as I'm here there are
a couple of things I'd like to pitch to you.

300
00:19:58,465 --> 00:20:01,344
He'll chase after almost anything
with 2 strikes on him.

301
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:04,906
I saw him whip on a curve in the dirt
against the Cubs last month.

302
00:20:04,938 --> 00:20:07,418
Congratulations, fellas.
Hell of a season.

303
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,919
Thanks, Hughie.

304
00:20:08,942 --> 00:20:11,422
Surprised to see you fellows in a gin mill.

305
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:12,855
- It's a celebration.

306
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:14,517
The whole team should be here.

307
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:18,394
Ginger ale. I had some of this once.

308
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:19,658
I think I was 6. Maybe 7.

309
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:23,532
Suppose that's what
they're drinking over there?

310
00:20:28,662 --> 00:20:31,768
Everybody's got their own
way of letting off steam, Ring.

311
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:34,335
It's what you do on the field that counts.

312
00:20:37,137 --> 00:20:40,880
So, if the thing with "Sport" falls through
we can try them two birds.

313
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:43,012
Why don't we just deal with them both?

314
00:20:43,043 --> 00:20:46,820
That way it's twice the payoff
for the same games.

315
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:50,020
Well, what if they
find out about each other?

316
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:53,827
Big deal. What are they going to do?
Call the cops?

317
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:59,960
Six or seven guys, $10,000 each?

318
00:20:59,993 --> 00:21:03,964
One guy who's got the scratch
to back that kind of action.

319
00:21:03,997 --> 00:21:05,442
Rothstein?

320
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:09,436
If we can get Rothstein
and they get Eddie Cicotte--

321
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:13,545
Eddie. Eddie's the man.

322
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:16,851
Real bad?

323
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:19,788
No worse than it's been.

324
00:21:19,813 --> 00:21:22,487
We'll get you rested pretty soon.

325
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:24,756
I'll dose three games in the series.

326
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,321
You'll do fine. You always do.

327
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:35,497
Every time I throw the fast ball
I feel it all the way down my spine.

328
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:39,107
And the knuckler--

329
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:41,703
Well, you know, I try to put it
where it don't wanna go.

330
00:21:42,702 --> 00:21:45,546
Some days it just does what it wants to.

331
00:21:45,572 --> 00:21:49,179
You always worry and you always do fine.

332
00:21:51,945 --> 00:21:53,822
Hi, girls.

333
00:21:53,847 --> 00:21:57,056
Your daddy's going to
pitch in the world series.

334
00:22:07,627 --> 00:22:09,265
- Hey, Mr. Weaver.

335
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:11,070
Don't you fellas never go home?

336
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:13,175
We saw you play today.

337
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,480
Here's your 2 bits back.

338
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:17,345
I stunk up the joint.

339
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:21,114
Nah. You'll straighten up
before the series.

340
00:22:21,141 --> 00:22:22,518
Sure.

341
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:26,388
His name's <i>Bucky</i>. We named him
after you on account you're his favorite.

342
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:29,121
No kiddin'?
- "Shoeless Joe" is my favorite.

343
00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:32,961
Joe's a heck of a player.
- Can you show me some tricks?

344
00:22:34,554 --> 00:22:36,033
No, it's gettin' kind of late.

345
00:22:36,056 --> 00:22:38,093
I gotta go. The wife, you know.

346
00:22:38,124 --> 00:22:39,601
Please?

347
00:22:45,165 --> 00:22:46,235
Alright.

348
00:22:46,266 --> 00:22:47,870
Get on your third sack and stance.

349
00:22:47,901 --> 00:22:49,346
Sure thing, Mr. Weaver.

350
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:52,373
Buck. Call me Buck.
Ready?

351
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:54,442
Bend your knees.

352
00:23:02,449 --> 00:23:06,727
Forget it. I make 6,000 a year.
A lot of people are out of work.

353
00:23:06,753 --> 00:23:10,462
How old are you, Eddie?
How long is the arm going to hold up?

354
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,764
Arm's fine.

355
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:14,499
You got hurt Commy  wouldn't even
pay your train fare home.

356
00:23:14,527 --> 00:23:16,473
What do you do then?

357
00:23:16,496 --> 00:23:18,806
I hear you're planning on
sending those girls of yours to college.

358
00:23:18,832 --> 00:23:21,278
Lookit, Chick, will you
just get off my back.

359
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:24,214
Just hear me out, will ya?

360
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:27,707
Hey, what's your hurry?
- I got a meeting with the old man.

361
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:30,483
Right now?
- Yes. Five, please.

362
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,080
You wouldn't say nothin',
would you, Eddie?

363
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:37,392
- You said if I won 30 games this year

364
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:39,226
there'd be a 10,000 dollar bonus.

365
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:40,230
So?

366
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:43,063
I think you owe it to me.

367
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:47,333
Harry, how many games did
Mr. Cicotte win for us this year?

368
00:23:49,696 --> 00:23:51,471
29, sir.

369
00:23:51,498 --> 00:23:56,447
You had Kid bench me for 2 whole
weeks in August. I missed 5 starts.

370
00:23:56,469 --> 00:23:58,312
We had to rest your arm for the series.

371
00:23:58,338 --> 00:24:01,342
I would have won
at least 2 of those games.

372
00:24:01,374 --> 00:24:02,785
You knew that.

373
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:07,383
I have to keep the best
interests of the club in mind, Eddie.

374
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:11,789
I think you owe me that bonus.

375
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:15,897
29 is not 30, Eddie.

376
00:24:15,922 --> 00:24:19,392
You will get only the money you deserve.

377
00:24:21,227 --> 00:24:22,900
Anything else?

378
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:28,575
No, Mr. Comiskey, that's it.

379
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:12,084
10,000.

380
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:14,581
Huh?

381
00:25:14,614 --> 00:25:16,594
Before the first game.

382
00:25:17,784 --> 00:25:19,457
Cash.

383
00:25:20,587 --> 00:25:21,998
What?

384
00:25:23,256 --> 00:25:24,894
You heard me.

385
00:25:45,678 --> 00:25:50,354
That's him, Burnsy. I seen him fight once,
just before he lost his featherweight title.

386
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:53,523
Held some kid up for three rounds
until he could drop the decision.

387
00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:55,157
It takes a real artist

388
00:25:55,188 --> 00:25:57,725
to dump a fight without hitting the canvas.

389
00:26:04,831 --> 00:26:07,937
See, I told you, Bill,
it's the little champ.

390
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:10,709
They don't take
nickel bets down here, fellas.

391
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:12,080
Abe Attell, right?

392
00:26:12,105 --> 00:26:15,416
You.
You were a ball player.

393
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:18,979
Bill Burns.
- "Sleepy" Bill Burns.

394
00:26:19,012 --> 00:26:20,582
Strictly bench material.

395
00:26:20,613 --> 00:26:24,186
I won a few games.
- You lost a few more.

396
00:26:24,217 --> 00:26:27,630
And, you my friend,
did not get that nose bobbing for apples.

397
00:26:27,654 --> 00:26:31,033
I'm a fighter, sort of.
- Sort of.

398
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:34,231
Let's see... Philly?

399
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,261
Yeah.

400
00:26:35,295 --> 00:26:36,968
Billy Maharg!

401
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:40,910
You seen me fight?
- Yeah, I seen ya. You're a bum!

402
00:26:40,934 --> 00:26:42,072
Hey.

403
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,705
Yeah!

404
00:26:43,736 --> 00:26:45,579
So, wadda you 2 birds want with me?

405
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:49,242
Word is you work for Arnold Rothstein.

406
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:53,348
We got a proposition to make.
Could be big money.

407
00:26:53,379 --> 00:26:57,156
Well, I'm Mr. Rothstein's ears,
so let's hear it.

408
00:27:06,426 --> 00:27:08,136
No dice.

409
00:27:09,262 --> 00:27:10,469
No dice.

410
00:27:10,997 --> 00:27:13,568
You're a practical man, Lefty.
You can see the advantages.

411
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:15,374
- Claude, who's that?

412
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:17,711
We got Cicotte in the bag already.

413
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:20,211
The hell you do!

414
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:22,116
He's in, Lefty. You can ask him.

415
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:24,747
Eddie can dump 3 games all on his own.

416
00:27:24,777 --> 00:27:27,553
The thing is done, Lefty.
With you or without you.

417
00:27:28,548 --> 00:27:31,051
We just didn't want to
leave you out of the payday.

418
00:27:32,385 --> 00:27:34,296
If you got Eddie...

419
00:27:35,855 --> 00:27:38,597
you got me, too.

420
00:27:40,393 --> 00:27:43,806
- Claude! Who is that?

421
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,366
Salesman.

422
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:48,743
- Well, whatever he's selling,
we don't want none.

423
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:55,445
Maxie Schwartz and "Irish Tommy" Flynn.

424
00:27:55,475 --> 00:27:57,079
Very tough boys.

425
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:59,112
What's the action on them?

426
00:27:59,145 --> 00:28:02,490
- Both are young and stupid.
Trying to make it the hard way.

427
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:06,895
I'd lay off if I was you.

428
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:08,398
Fight's on the level, huh?

429
00:28:09,822 --> 00:28:10,800
Listen, A.R...

430
00:28:10,823 --> 00:28:12,996
this serie thing
those 'ham and eggers' pitched--

431
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:14,630
Not interested.

432
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,231
We could see a good hunk of change on it.

433
00:28:18,431 --> 00:28:22,402
If it's Burns and Maharg you're worried about,
we could just cut them out and do it ourselves.

434
00:28:22,435 --> 00:28:24,278
Word gets out Arnold Rothstein

435
00:28:24,303 --> 00:28:27,841
is betting against the Sox,
what happens to the odds?

436
00:28:27,874 --> 00:28:30,616
They drop down the john,
but I can bet through these guys.

437
00:28:30,643 --> 00:28:33,624
How long do you think they're
going to keep their mouths shut?

438
00:28:33,646 --> 00:28:36,627
20 minutes?
Half hour? What?

439
00:28:36,649 --> 00:28:39,220
Yeah, but, they got six guys, maybe seven.

440
00:28:39,252 --> 00:28:41,858
Doesn't surprise me.

441
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:43,367
But, they're the champs.

442
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:45,869
You were the champ once, Abe.

443
00:28:45,892 --> 00:28:47,963
You went down for the bucks.

444
00:28:47,994 --> 00:28:50,201
This is different.

445
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:55,435
Look, champ, I know who these guys are.

446
00:28:55,468 --> 00:28:57,277
I grew up with guys like that.

447
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:00,517
I was the fat kid they wouldn't let play.

448
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,986
"Sit down fat boy",
that's what they tell me.

449
00:29:03,009 --> 00:29:06,650
"Sit down. Maybe you'll learn something".

450
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:08,955
Well, I learned something, alright.

451
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:12,724
Pretty soon I owned the game.

452
00:29:12,752 --> 00:29:16,791
And, those guys I come up with, they come
to me now with their hats in their hands.

453
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:19,664
Tell me, champ.

454
00:29:19,692 --> 00:29:23,367
All those years of pugging,
how much you make?

455
00:29:23,396 --> 00:29:25,672
The honest fights, or the ones I tanked?

456
00:29:25,698 --> 00:29:29,578
Altogether I must have made 10 times more
betting on you  than you did slugging it out.

457
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:31,604
I never took a punch.

458
00:29:31,637 --> 00:29:33,708
Yeah, but I was champ.

459
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:36,777
Featherweight champion of the world.

460
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:38,584
Yesterday.

461
00:29:40,213 --> 00:29:42,193
That was yesterday.

462
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:44,217
No, A.R., you're wrong.

463
00:29:45,418 --> 00:29:49,730
I was champ
and can nothin' take that away.

464
00:29:55,962 --> 00:29:57,873
Now, about this fix thing.
Maybe if we--

465
00:29:57,897 --> 00:30:00,070
I'm not interested, Abe.

466
00:30:05,538 --> 00:30:07,074
I gotta go get me some air.

467
00:30:07,106 --> 00:30:08,107
I'll see you later.

468
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:25,569
Grammercy 8439.

469
00:30:27,026 --> 00:30:30,667
8...4...3...9.

470
00:30:31,797 --> 00:30:33,105
Right.

471
00:30:36,469 --> 00:30:37,880
Nat?

472
00:30:37,904 --> 00:30:39,577
A.R.

473
00:30:39,605 --> 00:30:43,553
Tell your Mr. Sullivan
he can stop by tonight.

474
00:30:43,576 --> 00:30:46,216
Have him use the servant's entrance.

475
00:30:46,245 --> 00:30:47,656
Yeah, he's in...

476
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,557
but, he wants his name kept out of this.

477
00:30:49,582 --> 00:30:51,220
Mr. Rothstein don't like publicity.

478
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,593
- No problem.

479
00:30:52,618 --> 00:30:56,156
'Cuz if this gets out the
odds go to shit and he goes off it .

480
00:30:56,189 --> 00:30:59,432
Gandil wants $100,000 for the players.

481
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:02,962
That shouldn't be any
problem for Arnold Rothstein.

482
00:31:02,995 --> 00:31:06,499
No. It's a cinch.

483
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:11,573
Yeah, yeah, I understand, Joey.
My heart bleeds.

484
00:31:11,604 --> 00:31:13,982
But, Mr. Rothstein's been
carrying you on this for months now

485
00:31:14,006 --> 00:31:16,987
and you ain't come back with a nickel.

486
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:19,080
That's right,
I'm collecting for him now.

487
00:31:19,111 --> 00:31:21,284
What, you'd rather talk
with Monk Eastman?

488
00:31:23,316 --> 00:31:27,731
No, no, Joey. I don't expect
the whole 40,000 right up front.

489
00:31:27,753 --> 00:31:32,202
But, listen, Joey, how about 10 or 15
as a gesture of good faith?

490
00:31:34,126 --> 00:31:37,005
It makes me happy
to hear you say that, Joey.

491
00:31:41,234 --> 00:31:42,611
Come in.

492
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:47,862
Mr. Rothstein.

493
00:31:48,067 --> 00:31:49,557
Let's hear it.

494
00:31:49,996 --> 00:31:52,219
It's the series, Mr. Rothstein.

495
00:31:52,645 --> 00:31:55,056
Seems to be a popular topic today.

496
00:31:55,248 --> 00:31:59,624
I can get eight men in,
including Cicotte.

497
00:31:59,952 --> 00:32:02,059
So, what do you need me for?

498
00:32:02,188 --> 00:32:05,169
Well, I'm a big man in Boston...

499
00:32:05,191 --> 00:32:07,967
but, Boston's a small town.

500
00:32:07,994 --> 00:32:09,735
The kinda cash that I need--

501
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:12,834
A man shouldn't bite off
more than he can chew.

502
00:32:12,865 --> 00:32:17,678
People watch what you do
real close, Mr. Rothstein.

503
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:23,312
If you, or one of your people,
were to bet heavily on the Reds, well--

504
00:32:23,342 --> 00:32:27,188
If I lay the action, the odds stay fat.

505
00:32:27,213 --> 00:32:29,159
And, there's no direct link.

506
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:31,457
Go home.

507
00:32:31,484 --> 00:32:34,431
Don't do anything until you hear from me.

508
00:32:38,224 --> 00:32:40,170
Yes, sir.

509
00:32:43,229 --> 00:32:45,231
Good night, Mr. Rothstein.

510
00:32:54,307 --> 00:32:56,667
Big man in Boston.

511
00:32:59,045 --> 00:33:01,958
You should've seen his place, Jimmy.

512
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:04,825
Them big bankrolls.

513
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:07,353
I never seen the like of it
outside of a museum.

514
00:33:09,722 --> 00:33:11,963
Message from Mr. Rothstein.

515
00:33:13,326 --> 00:33:14,566
You--

516
00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:16,539
go away.

517
00:33:16,562 --> 00:33:17,563
- Jimmy...

518
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:20,270
go get me some cigarettes for the trip.

519
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:22,279
Sure.

520
00:33:26,806 --> 00:33:29,446
Mr. Rothstein says he's in.

521
00:33:30,276 --> 00:33:31,949
40,000 to the players, up front.

522
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:37,959
You hold the other 40
'til they blow the series.

523
00:33:37,983 --> 00:33:40,395
Tell Cicotte to hit the first batter

524
00:33:40,419 --> 00:33:41,864
if the fix is on.

525
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:44,561
Anybody connects Mr. Rothstein with this,

526
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,831
I come see you again.

527
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:48,736
You don't want that.

528
00:33:49,795 --> 00:33:53,299
You tell Mr. Rothstein he's got my word.

529
00:34:00,473 --> 00:34:02,316
I never knew you smoked, Sport.

530
00:34:02,341 --> 00:34:04,547
Holy mother.

531
00:34:04,977 --> 00:34:08,754
When you look at it, Jimmy,
all spread out like that...

532
00:34:08,781 --> 00:34:11,887
Whose is it?
- Who do you think?

533
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:15,763
I want you to take this 20,000
back to Boston.

534
00:34:15,788 --> 00:34:17,461
I want you to go over to Mullcahy.

535
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:19,401
You know the password.

536
00:34:19,425 --> 00:34:22,929
I want you to put it all
down on Cincinnati for the first game.

537
00:34:22,962 --> 00:34:24,999
Tell him it's just a hunch I've got.

538
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,065
Some hunch!

539
00:34:26,098 --> 00:34:29,136
Then, I want you to
take this to McGinnis.

540
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:32,308
And, you tell him
you're sure I've gone crazy...

541
00:34:32,338 --> 00:34:35,615
but, I want to place
10 big ones on the Reds

542
00:34:35,641 --> 00:34:37,245
for the whole show.

543
00:34:37,276 --> 00:34:38,880
I'm laying bets for Rothstein?

544
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:40,913
You're laying bets for me.

545
00:34:40,946 --> 00:34:44,010
That thievin' jew don't know it,
but he just givin' me a loan.

546
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:45,620
Well, then what's left for the players?

547
00:34:45,662 --> 00:34:48,017
Jimmy, you know what you feed
a dray horse in the morning

548
00:34:48,053 --> 00:34:49,930
if you want a day's work out of him?

549
00:34:49,955 --> 00:34:51,059
- What?

550
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:55,049
Just enough so he knows he's hungry.

551
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:03,437
Fellas.
- Hey, Ring.

552
00:35:05,137 --> 00:35:07,777
Hey, boys.
- Hughie.

553
00:35:07,807 --> 00:35:09,787
Hey, you guys want in on this?

554
00:35:09,809 --> 00:35:13,188
No. I hear Gandil deals from the bottom.

555
00:35:13,212 --> 00:35:14,782
Good luck with the Reds, fellas.

556
00:35:14,814 --> 00:35:16,384
Thanks, Ring.

557
00:35:20,986 --> 00:35:22,556
Hey, fellas.
- Hi, Ring.

558
00:35:22,588 --> 00:35:24,932
Good luck. Knock 'em dead.

559
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:26,095
Hiya, Eddie.

560
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:31,506
How's the old soup bone feeling?

561
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:32,873
Uh... Bad.

562
00:35:32,898 --> 00:35:36,539
- Hughie's bringing his nest-egg down
to lay it on you birds for the series.

563
00:35:36,569 --> 00:35:39,345
Ha. He shouldn't ought to do that.

564
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:41,476
Anything can happen in baseball.

565
00:35:41,507 --> 00:35:43,384
Hughie's a lucky man.

566
00:35:44,577 --> 00:35:46,818
Luck won't have nothin' to do with it.

567
00:35:46,846 --> 00:35:47,847
- Eddie?

568
00:35:50,049 --> 00:35:51,585
Excuse me, Ring.

569
00:35:54,854 --> 00:35:56,424
- C'mon, it's in the bag.

570
00:35:56,455 --> 00:35:58,992
I just wanted to let you and Buck
in on the take.

571
00:35:59,024 --> 00:36:01,834
In on what take?
- Sounds like you're already in pretty deep.

572
00:36:01,861 --> 00:36:05,502
C'mon, Hap. We lose a couple of games,
we make 20,000 dollars.

573
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:07,067
A couple, or the whole bit?

574
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:09,170
Hey, whoa, whoa!
What are you guys talking about?

575
00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:12,876
What about Jackson?
- Swede's pitching him now. He'll come around.

576
00:36:12,905 --> 00:36:15,181
You can be sure if Joe ain't in, I ain't in.

577
00:36:15,207 --> 00:36:18,120
So what if they find you're dealing double?
You cross a guy like Rothstein

578
00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:20,817
they're gonna find you in the gutter
with your toes curled up.

579
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:22,416
Hey, fellas...

580
00:36:22,448 --> 00:36:24,428
Who's this?!

581
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:26,726
Anyone care for a drink?

582
00:36:29,889 --> 00:36:31,527
- Hey, Joe.

583
00:36:31,557 --> 00:36:32,558
Hi.

584
00:36:41,133 --> 00:36:44,171
I stare at it 'til the eye goes blind.

585
00:36:45,207 --> 00:36:49,079
Oh...
What then?

586
00:36:49,408 --> 00:36:51,452
Do the other one.

587
00:36:54,747 --> 00:36:57,626
It's good for my batting eye.

588
00:36:59,919 --> 00:37:01,296
Something wrong?

589
00:37:02,521 --> 00:37:04,831
Hey, you're the doctor.

590
00:37:04,857 --> 00:37:09,769
Listen, Joe. We got together, most of
the guys. And the thing is, uh...

591
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:12,672
we're going to drop
a couple of games in the series.

592
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:16,269
Who?

593
00:37:16,302 --> 00:37:18,077
Oh, everybody.

594
00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:22,245
Chick, me, Cicotte, Lefty--
- Lefty?

595
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:26,347
Sure, Lefty.
And Fred and Hap and Bucky.

596
00:37:26,378 --> 00:37:28,119
Everybody.

597
00:37:28,147 --> 00:37:30,627
And Joe... some of them--

598
00:37:30,649 --> 00:37:32,651
I won't name names, but--

599
00:37:32,685 --> 00:37:33,993
I had to tell them no.

600
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:37,193
We can't leave Joe out of this.
He's one of us.

601
00:37:37,222 --> 00:37:39,463
You want me?

602
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:41,869
We need you, Joe.

603
00:37:41,894 --> 00:37:44,306
I don't know.

604
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:47,800
- You'd be an awful sap to
turn it down at this point, Joe.

605
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:50,006
Lefty and Eddie?

606
00:37:50,035 --> 00:37:52,606
I mean it would just be
stupid not to do it.

607
00:37:52,638 --> 00:37:54,311
You don't want to be stupid, do you, Joe?

608
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,411
I don't know.

609
00:37:56,442 --> 00:37:59,719
People are going to be awful pissed
if you fuck up their plans, Joe.

610
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:02,692
You don't want to piss everybody off,
do you, Joe. Huh?

611
00:38:02,715 --> 00:38:05,218
You don't want me mad at you, do you?

612
00:38:07,219 --> 00:38:09,086
Everybody else is in?

613
00:38:09,274 --> 00:38:11,200
Everybody we need.

614
00:38:13,626 --> 00:38:15,037
Okay.

615
00:38:17,029 --> 00:38:19,009
There's a good boy.

616
00:38:19,031 --> 00:38:21,307
You won't have to look bad.

617
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:22,869
Just ease off a bit.

618
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:25,142
That's all we want.

619
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,808
Oh... About the money--

620
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:30,082
At least 10,000,
on top of your regular series pay.

621
00:38:32,311 --> 00:38:34,778
Chick's workin' on it.

622
00:38:48,093 --> 00:38:49,128
Hey, Bucky.

623
00:38:49,161 --> 00:38:50,970
Welcome to the club.

624
00:38:52,965 --> 00:38:55,002
Now, Sport, how about it, hey?

625
00:38:55,034 --> 00:38:56,945
If your fellas come through, Chickie,
you'll see the rest of it.

626
00:38:56,969 --> 00:38:58,744
But, you gotta show something for this.

627
00:38:58,771 --> 00:39:02,480
Now, listen. I told the boys before--
- Hey, Swede. You're lookin' fit, boy.

628
00:39:05,678 --> 00:39:07,021
He come through?

629
00:39:07,046 --> 00:39:09,492
Yeah, everything's well.

630
00:39:09,515 --> 00:39:12,792
Listen now. Burns and Maharg are in
the bar car with this Abe Attell character.

631
00:39:12,818 --> 00:39:14,957
They say they got the jack lined up,
so I'll go in there

632
00:39:14,987 --> 00:39:18,799
and have a couple of pops with 'em
'til I'm through with the boys in there.

633
00:39:18,824 --> 00:39:21,532
Sure. And which way's Bucky?

634
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,800
No problem.

635
00:39:22,828 --> 00:39:25,308
Bucky's one of the boys.

636
00:39:48,187 --> 00:39:49,165
Hughie!

637
00:39:49,188 --> 00:39:50,166
Ring!

638
00:39:50,189 --> 00:39:54,103
Get it all down?
- I go to bet last night at 7 to 3 on the Sox.

639
00:39:54,126 --> 00:39:55,730
Now it's even money.
- You're kidding?

640
00:39:55,761 --> 00:39:59,971
No, I'm not kidding. some very big money
from New York went down on the Reds.

641
00:39:59,998 --> 00:40:02,000
Maybe they know something we don't.

642
00:40:02,034 --> 00:40:03,570
Think Cicotte's arm is sore?

643
00:40:03,602 --> 00:40:06,082
Eddie's had a sore arm for 10 years.

644
00:40:06,105 --> 00:40:07,948
Something's up.

645
00:40:13,612 --> 00:40:14,784
Hey, Bill.

646
00:40:14,813 --> 00:40:18,283
Not a trace of Attell.
- Where is that little rat?

647
00:40:18,317 --> 00:40:19,728
It's all out on bets.

648
00:40:19,752 --> 00:40:22,255
That's not good enough.

649
00:40:22,287 --> 00:40:23,823
Jesus.

650
00:40:23,856 --> 00:40:25,858
You'll get it soon enough.

651
00:40:25,891 --> 00:40:26,892
When?

652
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,063
How much?

653
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:31,768
100,000, like I said.
20 after each game.

654
00:40:31,797 --> 00:40:34,277
Now, wait a minute.
That's five games.

655
00:40:34,299 --> 00:40:35,710
I thought we were just
going to dump a few.

656
00:40:35,734 --> 00:40:37,213
No, you lose the first three.

657
00:40:37,236 --> 00:40:39,341
Kerr is going in the third.
He's not with us.

658
00:40:39,371 --> 00:40:42,716
So what? If we don't hit for him
he'll fold. He's a busher.

659
00:40:42,741 --> 00:40:43,981
After that we'll play it by ear.

660
00:40:44,009 --> 00:40:46,182
We gotta make this look good, see?

661
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:49,550
I said before the first game, Chick.

662
00:40:49,581 --> 00:40:51,527
Look under your pillow.
- Huh?

663
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,496
Compliments of "Sport" Sullivan.

664
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:56,398
Whenever Mr. Rothstein fixes something,
it stays fixed.

665
00:41:19,812 --> 00:41:21,655
Getting the jump on us, Bucky?

666
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,886
Hi, Kid.

667
00:41:22,915 --> 00:41:25,725
No.
It's just all them reporters at the hotel.

668
00:41:25,751 --> 00:41:27,162
I couldn't think.

669
00:41:28,854 --> 00:41:32,199
I hear some of you fellows
got together on the train last night.

670
00:41:33,258 --> 00:41:34,760
Pep talk, you know.

671
00:41:37,296 --> 00:41:39,776
Something on your mind, Bucky?

672
00:41:39,798 --> 00:41:41,778
You don't look so good.

673
00:41:44,236 --> 00:41:46,307
Kid, what would you--

674
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:49,319
No, forget it. It's just nerves.
Nerves is all.

675
00:41:52,544 --> 00:41:55,787
Remember all that ground ball patch
when you first come on?

676
00:41:55,814 --> 00:41:58,556
Yeah. You made a ball player out of me.

677
00:41:58,584 --> 00:42:00,655
You were a ball player all along.

678
00:42:00,686 --> 00:42:03,189
I just took some of the rough edges off,
that's all.

679
00:42:03,222 --> 00:42:05,563
Do you miss it, Kid? Playing?

680
00:42:06,425 --> 00:42:09,167
Every day and every night.

681
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:11,231
I don't know what I'd do without it.

682
00:42:13,665 --> 00:42:15,338
Better go back and get some sleep.

683
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:17,108
We gotta be sharp for them Reds tomorrow.

684
00:42:17,135 --> 00:42:18,773
Alright.

685
00:42:18,804 --> 00:42:21,648
In the morning.
- Good night, son.

686
00:42:32,086 --> 00:42:35,624
Cicotte, you're a bum!
Go! Go home, Cicotte!

687
00:43:17,195 --> 00:43:19,471
...good seats.

688
00:43:19,498 --> 00:43:21,671
These guys don't look so tough.

689
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,340
Yeah? That's what Custer said
when the Indians took the field.

690
00:43:55,302 --> 00:43:58,404
Smitty... Today's the day!

691
00:43:58,437 --> 00:43:59,575
- It's a fine day.

692
00:43:59,604 --> 00:44:02,312
A beautiful day for it, huh?

693
00:44:02,341 --> 00:44:04,287
- Look, I heard the same thing, fellas.

694
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:08,553
Every series I've been to there's been some
rumor about a fix just to shake up the odds.

695
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,856
Hang out in bars you
hear a lot of screwy things.

696
00:44:10,882 --> 00:44:12,657
Doesn't mean they're not true.

697
00:44:14,219 --> 00:44:16,221
My guys would've told me
if something was up.

698
00:44:16,254 --> 00:44:18,131
- Sure they would, Kid.

699
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:19,794
Give 'em a hard day.

700
00:44:23,895 --> 00:44:26,637
Let's keep separate score cards.

701
00:44:26,665 --> 00:44:30,169
You circle every play that smells fishy.
I'll do the same.

702
00:44:30,202 --> 00:44:32,648
We'll compare them after the game.

703
00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:34,517
Probably nothing to it.

704
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:38,050
Yeah, nothing to it.

705
00:44:47,919 --> 00:44:49,398
How's it feeling, Joe?

706
00:44:50,389 --> 00:44:52,130
I don't want to play.

707
00:44:52,157 --> 00:44:53,534
What?!

708
00:44:53,558 --> 00:44:55,231
I don't want to play.

709
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,467
You can tell the boss that, too.

710
00:44:57,496 --> 00:44:59,737
You'll play, Jackson!

711
00:44:59,765 --> 00:45:01,506
You'll play!

712
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:12,506
[ Band Playing ]
♫ I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles ♫

713
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:22,364
- I've been hearing a lot about odds lately,
like this is a race track.

714
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:24,458
Everybody's a damn handicapper.

715
00:45:24,489 --> 00:45:26,628
Well, sometimes the smart money

716
00:45:26,658 --> 00:45:30,071
gets a little too smart for its own good.

717
00:45:31,063 --> 00:45:32,235
But, I tell you...

718
00:45:32,264 --> 00:45:34,403
I've been in this game over 30 years.

719
00:45:34,433 --> 00:45:38,040
I never yet seen a club
could hold a candle to you fellas.

720
00:45:39,037 --> 00:45:40,612
That's the straight dope.

721
00:45:41,873 --> 00:45:43,853
The way I figure, we can't be beaten.

722
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:46,287
We can only beat ourselves.

723
00:45:48,213 --> 00:45:50,591
You fellas know what I mean.

724
00:45:54,186 --> 00:45:56,291
Alright, let's get 'em!

725
00:46:06,498 --> 00:46:08,000
Excuse me.

726
00:46:10,635 --> 00:46:13,548
- Weaver fouled out to Roush.

727
00:46:13,572 --> 00:46:17,486
Sox, no score.
First half inning.

728
00:46:17,509 --> 00:46:20,490
Cincinnati coming to bat.

729
00:46:20,512 --> 00:46:23,322
Would you like a seat, Mr. Rothstein?

730
00:46:23,348 --> 00:46:25,658
I won't be here that long.

731
00:46:32,724 --> 00:46:34,829
Alright, let's play ball!

732
00:46:36,495 --> 00:46:38,566
- Let's go, Eddie!
Let's get 'em now! Let's get 'em!

733
00:46:38,597 --> 00:46:40,076
Here we go, Eddie!

734
00:46:40,098 --> 00:46:41,907
Right in here!
Throw a five, Eddie!

735
00:46:45,237 --> 00:46:46,238
Strike!

736
00:46:59,851 --> 00:47:01,626
Take your base!

737
00:47:11,897 --> 00:47:15,310
Rath, hit by a pitched ball...

738
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:17,779
advances to first.

739
00:47:26,244 --> 00:47:27,848
- Right in here, Eddie.

740
00:47:27,879 --> 00:47:29,358
Let's do it, Eddie!

741
00:47:29,381 --> 00:47:31,827
C'mon! Right in here, Eddie!

742
00:47:54,339 --> 00:47:56,046
- Okay, Eddie, breeze it here, Eddie!

743
00:47:56,074 --> 00:47:57,610
C'mon, Eddie!

744
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:03,185
Back, back!

745
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:13,763
Way to go, Happy.

746
00:48:20,165 --> 00:48:22,736
What the hell's he doing?
- No one wants to look bad.

747
00:48:22,767 --> 00:48:25,771
Eddie's going to have to
do it all by himself.

748
00:48:45,223 --> 00:48:46,827
Safe!

749
00:48:46,858 --> 00:48:48,166
- He was off the bag!

750
00:48:48,193 --> 00:48:50,434
C'mon, guys. That coulda been two!

751
00:48:57,235 --> 00:48:59,112
One out!

752
00:49:05,877 --> 00:49:07,788
Swede! Swede!

753
00:49:11,383 --> 00:49:13,886
Risberg, you zero, What are you doing?

754
00:49:13,918 --> 00:49:15,158
You woulda had him!

755
00:49:26,564 --> 00:49:28,601
- C'mon, Eddie! Cut him down!

756
00:49:39,544 --> 00:49:41,080
You okay?
- Gimme the ball.

757
00:49:41,124 --> 00:49:43,044
Take it easy.
- Gimme the ball.

758
00:49:44,149 --> 00:49:46,192
Hey, Eddie! Keep it down!

759
00:50:04,602 --> 00:50:06,582
Short! Short!

760
00:50:09,607 --> 00:50:11,883
Eddie, he's the goddamn pitcher!

761
00:50:17,148 --> 00:50:19,560
- The pitcher's finished!

762
00:50:34,599 --> 00:50:37,705
Guess it's not your day, Eddie.

763
00:50:37,736 --> 00:50:39,443
Guess not.

764
00:50:44,676 --> 00:50:48,385
- Gandil grounds out to second base.

765
00:50:48,413 --> 00:50:50,415
Final out.

766
00:50:50,448 --> 00:50:54,590
Redlegs 9, White Sox 1.

767
00:51:07,899 --> 00:51:10,038
So, what's the story, Buck?

768
00:51:13,071 --> 00:51:15,073
What does it look like?

769
00:51:15,106 --> 00:51:17,077
It looked like you skunked out on us.

770
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:20,951
I haven't taken a nickel.
I don't owe any of you a damn thing.

771
00:51:21,946 --> 00:51:23,254
We let you in on a meeting.

772
00:51:23,281 --> 00:51:27,956
You just play your ball game and I'll
play mine and we'll see how it comes out.

773
00:51:39,564 --> 00:51:41,376
Come on in.

774
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,188
Ring.

775
00:51:43,334 --> 00:51:44,506
Hiya, Eddie.

776
00:51:44,536 --> 00:51:45,981
Have a seat.

777
00:51:47,605 --> 00:51:49,212
I thought Cincy was a dry town.

778
00:51:49,441 --> 00:51:51,421
Laws were made to be broken.

779
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:53,687
Catch.

780
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:56,717
- What's this?

781
00:51:56,748 --> 00:51:59,354
The new ball they're
thinking of using next year.

782
00:51:59,384 --> 00:52:01,295
It's wound tighter.

783
00:52:02,287 --> 00:52:04,324
This thing will take off like a rabbit.

784
00:52:04,355 --> 00:52:07,131
- The word is they'll
outlaw the spitter next year.

785
00:52:07,158 --> 00:52:08,637
And, your shine ball.

786
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:10,663
Things will be tough for pitchers.

787
00:52:10,862 --> 00:52:13,242
Things are always tough for pitchers.

788
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,907
You really took a shelling out there today.

789
00:52:17,936 --> 00:52:19,574
Ah, they got their raps in.

790
00:52:19,604 --> 00:52:23,313
That one Reuther caught hold of
looked like you tossed it in underhand.

791
00:52:23,341 --> 00:52:24,877
It didn't break.

792
00:52:24,909 --> 00:52:27,048
You didn't put anything on it.

793
00:52:27,078 --> 00:52:28,685
Why should it break?

794
00:52:30,215 --> 00:52:32,891
You bring me up here
to tell me I had a lousy day?

795
00:52:36,521 --> 00:52:39,525
I wanna know if the series
is on the level, Eddie.

796
00:52:42,293 --> 00:52:44,530
What if I told you
we're doing our best?

797
00:52:44,763 --> 00:52:46,902
I'll believe you.

798
00:52:49,234 --> 00:52:52,078
We played like a bunch of bushers today.

799
00:52:52,103 --> 00:52:53,980
But nobody's in the bag.

800
00:52:56,541 --> 00:52:58,759
Don't be sore at me for asking, okay?

801
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:02,414
Nah. We're just dumb ball players.

802
00:53:03,715 --> 00:53:06,926
We need a mug like you to keep us honest.

803
00:53:10,121 --> 00:53:11,828
Yeah.

804
00:53:11,856 --> 00:53:13,028
- It's me, Joe.

805
00:53:20,865 --> 00:53:22,776
I got something for you, Joe.

806
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,643
On the dresser.

807
00:53:29,474 --> 00:53:31,511
Swede said he'd appreciate it

808
00:53:31,543 --> 00:53:34,990
if you'd ease up a little on the field.

809
00:53:35,013 --> 00:53:38,294
You looked awful good out there today.

810
00:53:46,658 --> 00:53:48,399
- Hey, c'mon, Lefty, let's groove one!

811
00:53:48,426 --> 00:53:50,337
Let's get this guy!

812
00:53:52,997 --> 00:53:54,340
Ball!

813
00:53:55,833 --> 00:53:58,541
Just stick 'em on for the glove, will ya?

814
00:54:04,342 --> 00:54:06,288
- C'mon, Dale!

815
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,585
- C'mon, Claude, let's go!

816
00:54:11,616 --> 00:54:13,152
Get it in here!

817
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:24,264
Safe!

818
00:54:24,295 --> 00:54:25,296
Time!

819
00:54:26,631 --> 00:54:28,804
I called for a curve ball.
- That's what I threw.

820
00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:31,677
Looked pretty straight to me.

821
00:54:31,703 --> 00:54:32,841
Two outs!

822
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:34,645
Let's go!

823
00:54:57,061 --> 00:54:58,165
I got it.

824
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:04,510
Safe!
- Curve ball, damn it!

825
00:55:07,205 --> 00:55:09,185
- You White Sox stink!

826
00:55:09,207 --> 00:55:10,811
- Williams! You stink!

827
00:55:10,842 --> 00:55:12,685
- Okay, let's go, Lefty! C'mon!

828
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:15,213
Bring it in here!
Let's go, let's go!

829
00:55:15,246 --> 00:55:18,523
Okay, Lefty! Hump it!

830
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,098
Out!

831
00:55:23,121 --> 00:55:24,566
Alright, Bucky!

832
00:55:24,589 --> 00:55:28,162
You guys see that? Way to go, Buck!

833
00:55:30,228 --> 00:55:31,298
Nice grab.

834
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:32,706
Yeah.

835
00:55:40,072 --> 00:55:43,179
- If you can't hit good, go back to Chicago!
- Go back!

836
00:55:44,742 --> 00:55:46,312
- You got shit for brains, Schalk!

837
00:55:53,551 --> 00:55:55,895
Hold it! Hold it!

838
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:56,921
Go! Go!

839
00:55:58,056 --> 00:55:59,660
Safe!

840
00:56:01,426 --> 00:56:03,372
Alright, fellas! C'mon! C'mon!

841
00:56:38,029 --> 00:56:40,509
Ask it if it can pitch.

842
00:56:59,817 --> 00:57:02,263
Williams, you son of a bitch!

843
00:57:02,286 --> 00:57:04,766
- What's the matter with you guys?

844
00:57:04,789 --> 00:57:07,463
Son of a bitch!

845
00:57:07,492 --> 00:57:10,905
He blocked me up all day out there
with those goddamn curve balls!

846
00:57:10,928 --> 00:57:12,271
What's this, Williams?

847
00:57:12,296 --> 00:57:15,607
What's that?!
- How about it, Lefty?

848
00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:20,443
- There he is! Hey, Kid!
- How about a few quotables, Kid?

849
00:57:20,471 --> 00:57:21,643
I got nothing to say!

850
00:57:21,672 --> 00:57:23,345
Hey, c'mon. Don't be a sore loser.

851
00:57:23,374 --> 00:57:24,512
I got nothin' to say!

852
00:57:24,542 --> 00:57:26,283
Now, get off my back, all of you!

853
00:57:28,446 --> 00:57:30,050
What's the scoop, Buck?

854
00:57:31,415 --> 00:57:33,417
Print what you want, Smitty.

855
00:57:43,594 --> 00:57:45,437
Have a good game, Gandil?

856
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:48,842
Not bad. Did you?

857
00:57:51,169 --> 00:57:54,378
I know what you're doing,
you son of a bitch!

858
00:57:54,405 --> 00:57:56,749
I know what you're doing!

859
00:57:56,774 --> 00:57:58,811
So help me...!

860
00:57:58,843 --> 00:58:00,322
Gandil! Gandil!

861
00:58:00,344 --> 00:58:03,123
C'mon, boys! C'mon, let's go!

862
00:58:03,748 --> 00:58:05,819
- Hey, Gleason! Comiskey!

863
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:10,299
We got one of your stiffs down here!

864
00:58:32,944 --> 00:58:34,787
Mr. Comiskey?

865
00:58:34,812 --> 00:58:36,917
- Who is it?
Gleason!

866
00:58:42,353 --> 00:58:44,526
I gotta talk to you.

867
00:58:44,555 --> 00:58:46,535
It better be important.

868
00:59:02,707 --> 00:59:05,210
If I'm being robbed of my world series

869
00:59:05,243 --> 00:59:08,520
he damn well better
do something about it!

870
00:59:31,603 --> 00:59:33,404
- What do you two birds want?

871
00:59:33,437 --> 00:59:35,041
We need the rest of the player's cut.

872
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:36,608
It's all out on bets.

873
00:59:37,508 --> 00:59:39,715
What's this?
- You heard me.

874
00:59:40,845 --> 00:59:44,759
I made an agreement with those guys.
- Well, that's your problem, ain't it?

875
00:59:44,782 --> 00:59:46,853
You little prick!

876
00:59:49,987 --> 00:59:54,163
Hey. A couple of boy scouts here,
they made a deal.

877
00:59:54,191 --> 00:59:56,467
The players are in now, get it?

878
00:59:56,494 --> 00:59:58,303
We got 'em by the short ones.

879
00:59:58,329 --> 01:00:00,434
What are they going to do?
Call a cop?

880
01:00:01,432 --> 01:00:05,778
Here... 10,000.

881
01:00:06,904 --> 01:00:09,111
But, that's all of it.
That's the end.

882
01:00:11,442 --> 01:00:14,082
Here. You give it to them.
- No, Burnsy, not me.

883
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:17,787
C'mon, Billy.

884
01:00:17,815 --> 01:00:20,318
It stinks in here.

885
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:22,888
And, tell them bums to
make it look good tomorrow.

886
01:00:29,527 --> 01:00:31,165
It's 2:00 in the morning.

887
01:00:31,195 --> 01:00:34,335
He's president of the league.
He has to do something.

888
01:00:34,365 --> 01:00:37,244
He isn't even talking to you, Commy.

889
01:00:37,268 --> 01:00:39,214
He's got to talk to me.

890
01:00:47,278 --> 01:00:48,655
- What do you want?

891
01:00:48,679 --> 01:00:50,386
Now, I just talked to Gleason.

892
01:00:50,414 --> 01:00:52,621
He thinks Williams threw the game.

893
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:55,631
- All I saw was that your boys
didn't have a shot--

894
01:00:55,653 --> 01:00:57,132
Sure thing, Sport.

895
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:59,634
- They lost it fair and square.

896
01:00:59,657 --> 01:01:01,136
I'm being robbed

897
01:01:01,158 --> 01:01:04,105
and you're going
to do something about it!

898
01:01:09,066 --> 01:01:12,104
That's the welcome of baiting currs!

899
01:01:13,404 --> 01:01:14,678
Commy!

900
01:01:21,012 --> 01:01:22,355
How you doin', Kid?

901
01:01:39,764 --> 01:01:40,936
Did you get it down?

902
01:01:40,965 --> 01:01:43,502
Every penny.
6 to 5 for the Reds is all.

903
01:01:43,534 --> 01:01:47,038
Even though the Chicago bunch
think Dickie Kerr will win.

904
01:01:51,442 --> 01:01:53,285
How's it feel, Dickie?

905
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:55,312
My arms great.

906
01:01:55,346 --> 01:01:56,950
It's my knees.

907
01:01:56,981 --> 01:01:58,551
Just another ball game.

908
01:01:58,582 --> 01:01:59,652
Sure.

909
01:02:01,385 --> 01:02:04,161
Pitch 'em one at a time, son.

910
01:02:04,188 --> 01:02:06,532
I remember the time I threw
a clean slate at the Cleveland club.

911
01:02:06,557 --> 01:02:09,060
You beat Cy Young one to nothing.

912
01:02:09,093 --> 01:02:11,539
Hughie Jennings hit a homer in the ninth.
- Huh?

913
01:02:11,562 --> 01:02:14,839
My grandfather took me.

914
01:02:14,865 --> 01:02:17,607
First big league game I ever went to.

915
01:02:17,635 --> 01:02:20,138
Kid Gleason beat the Indians
with a no-hitter.

916
01:02:20,171 --> 01:02:21,479
No kiddin'?!

917
01:02:24,208 --> 01:02:26,381
You're havin' a hell of a series, Buck.

918
01:02:28,112 --> 01:02:29,921
What's that supposed to mean?

919
01:02:29,947 --> 01:02:33,258
Nothin'. Just keep it up is all.

920
01:02:33,284 --> 01:02:35,924
Why wouldn't I?

921
01:02:35,953 --> 01:02:38,524
You'd know the answer to that
better than I would, Buck.

922
01:02:43,761 --> 01:02:45,399
- Take your base.

923
01:03:15,993 --> 01:03:17,394
Run, damn it!

924
01:03:18,662 --> 01:03:19,970
You're out!

925
01:03:19,997 --> 01:03:21,908
What the hell was that?

926
01:03:21,932 --> 01:03:25,470
I could have beaten that throwout
with my shoes tied together!

927
01:03:25,503 --> 01:03:27,613
- Never get work as an actor.

928
01:03:31,675 --> 01:03:35,145
- Okay, Dickie, this is it, Dickie.
You got 'em!

929
01:03:35,179 --> 01:03:37,159
Here we go! Here we go, Dickie!

930
01:03:37,181 --> 01:03:38,558
Let's do it!

931
01:03:38,582 --> 01:03:41,961
Here we go, Dickie, here we go!

932
01:03:47,124 --> 01:03:49,104
- Swing!
- Swing!

933
01:03:49,126 --> 01:03:50,605
You're out!

934
01:03:55,399 --> 01:03:58,209
Beautiful, Dickie, that's the way!

935
01:04:00,971 --> 01:04:02,314
Come on, Dickie!

936
01:04:27,731 --> 01:04:29,369
Slide! You've got it!

937
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:30,845
Safe!

938
01:04:33,103 --> 01:04:34,081
Swing!

939
01:04:34,104 --> 01:04:35,583
Swing!

940
01:04:35,606 --> 01:04:38,382
You're out! Three strikes!

941
01:04:41,111 --> 01:04:42,215
Out!

942
01:04:42,246 --> 01:04:44,692
Great throw, buddy!

943
01:04:56,527 --> 01:05:01,067
That's the winner! Alright, Dickie!

944
01:05:05,669 --> 01:05:08,707
Bill?
- Yeah?

945
01:05:08,739 --> 01:05:12,118
Think you can stake me
the train fare back to Philly?

946
01:05:14,311 --> 01:05:17,224
Hey, Joey, I hate to bother you but, it's
about that 20,000 you still owe Mr. Rothstein.

947
01:05:17,248 --> 01:05:19,421
You gonna come up with it?
What?

948
01:05:21,018 --> 01:05:23,726
Well, if it's all clear between you two,
I'm delighted to hear it.

949
01:05:23,754 --> 01:05:27,668
Listen, Joey. Since you're sitting pretty
over there I could use 2,000 over here--

950
01:05:29,293 --> 01:05:31,000
What do you mean it's all out on bets?

951
01:05:31,028 --> 01:05:33,599
Kerr had the day of his life...

952
01:05:33,631 --> 01:05:37,511
but, if it wasn't 5 out of 9 this year,
they'd be cooked.

953
01:05:37,534 --> 01:05:40,037
We'll have to see what
Eddie Cicotte shows them tomorrow.

954
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:42,482
Yeah, Eddie is the ticket.

955
01:05:47,645 --> 01:05:50,649
Ah, so that's where you went.

956
01:05:50,681 --> 01:05:52,922
Keep you up last night?

957
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:54,952
Don't make any difference.

958
01:05:54,985 --> 01:05:56,862
You're the one needs the sleep.

959
01:05:58,656 --> 01:06:00,693
You shouldn't worry so much.

960
01:06:00,724 --> 01:06:02,897
You're gonna wallop 'em today.

961
01:06:02,926 --> 01:06:04,132
You got the home field.

962
01:06:04,161 --> 01:06:06,641
The whole city's there backing you up.

963
01:06:09,833 --> 01:06:12,914
If I tell you something,
you swear you'll never tell a soul?

964
01:06:14,138 --> 01:06:15,139
What is it?

965
01:06:17,341 --> 01:06:19,912
Some of the guys
ain't playing on the level.

966
01:06:19,943 --> 01:06:21,650
Nah?!

967
01:06:21,679 --> 01:06:25,525
Chick, Swede, Lefty, Eddie Cicotte and
some of the others. It's hard for me to tell.

968
01:06:25,549 --> 01:06:28,428
Eddie?
- Eddie.

969
01:06:28,452 --> 01:06:29,829
They wanted me in on it, too.

970
01:06:29,853 --> 01:06:32,026
What'd you tell 'em?

971
01:06:32,056 --> 01:06:33,660
I told them to take a hike!

972
01:06:35,826 --> 01:06:40,399
Now, I go out there on the field, you know.
I make the plays. I don't feel right.

973
01:06:41,031 --> 01:06:43,170
Isn't there somebody you can tell?

974
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,541
Kid knows. He's got to.

975
01:06:46,570 --> 01:06:48,144
Sometimes I figure he's like me.

976
01:06:48,172 --> 01:06:51,745
He's waiting for the boys to
straighten up in time to take the series.

977
01:06:54,345 --> 01:06:56,621
The dugout is like--

978
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:02,026
Nobody can look each other in the eye.

979
01:07:03,454 --> 01:07:07,459
Go out on the field and you
don't know who's trying and who's not.

980
01:07:15,833 --> 01:07:19,280
I wish I didn't know.

981
01:07:19,303 --> 01:07:22,409
Yeah, me either.

982
01:07:22,439 --> 01:07:24,441
- Okay, Eddie!

983
01:07:24,475 --> 01:07:26,477
Let's get 'em!

984
01:07:26,510 --> 01:07:28,319
Right in there! Throw a five, Eddie!

985
01:07:39,923 --> 01:07:42,597
Eddie! Eddie!

986
01:07:42,626 --> 01:07:44,503
Cicotte! What was that?

987
01:07:44,528 --> 01:07:46,337
You look like a busher.

988
01:07:50,601 --> 01:07:53,800
- C'mon, Knuckles, keep it down!

989
01:07:53,837 --> 01:07:55,612
C'mon, Eddie! Let's go!
Let's get it in here!

990
01:07:59,943 --> 01:08:02,321
Joe, four!

991
01:08:02,346 --> 01:08:03,791
Joe, four!

992
01:08:05,115 --> 01:08:06,924
Let it go! Let it go!

993
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:10,363
Eddie, what are you doing?!

994
01:08:10,387 --> 01:08:13,095
How do you make a play like that?

995
01:08:13,123 --> 01:08:15,428
- What did you grab it off for, Eddie?

996
01:08:20,831 --> 01:08:23,072
You lied to me, Eddie.

997
01:08:27,237 --> 01:08:28,614
- Don't worry, Commy.

998
01:08:28,639 --> 01:08:31,085
Your boys will be right tomorrow.

999
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:39,020
- Okay! Okay!
Let's get 'em!

1000
01:08:52,629 --> 01:08:53,630
Safe.

1001
01:08:57,301 --> 01:08:59,347
Now it's Felsch.

1002
01:09:09,746 --> 01:09:11,384
Get it down, Happer!

1003
01:09:14,818 --> 01:09:17,230
- Go! Run! Run!

1004
01:09:18,455 --> 01:09:20,162
Safe.

1005
01:09:20,190 --> 01:09:24,605
Safe? You goddamn fiddlesticks, I had him!
Who's paying you?

1006
01:09:24,628 --> 01:09:25,732
Take a walk, Ray.

1007
01:09:25,762 --> 01:09:29,232
That's the worst call I've ever seen, Draper,
and that I've seen for seven years!

1008
01:09:29,266 --> 01:09:32,213
You heard me, Ray--
Out of the ball game!

1009
01:09:33,203 --> 01:09:35,342
It's all yours, Kid!

1010
01:09:43,447 --> 01:09:45,484
C'mon, let's go!

1011
01:09:45,516 --> 01:09:47,223
It's all yours!

1012
01:09:49,152 --> 01:09:50,358
Throw it!

1013
01:09:50,387 --> 01:09:51,365
Hey, Buck.

1014
01:09:51,388 --> 01:09:53,629
Hi, fellas.

1015
01:09:53,657 --> 01:09:56,934
Hey, guys! Look, it's Buck Weaver.

1016
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,371
Tough breaks today.

1017
01:09:58,395 --> 01:10:00,898
Yeah, I couldn't get the wood on the ball.
- No kiddin'.

1018
01:10:00,931 --> 01:10:03,309
My old man says you guys just gave up.

1019
01:10:03,333 --> 01:10:05,677
He says the Sox just
laid down for the Reds.

1020
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:07,739
Your old man don't know beans!
- Says who?

1021
01:10:09,973 --> 01:10:12,078
Hey! Hey, ease up!

1022
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:14,946
Thanks for sticking up for us.

1023
01:10:14,978 --> 01:10:16,719
A guy's gotta stick up for his friends.

1024
01:10:16,747 --> 01:10:18,488
- Even when they play
like a bunch of stiffs?

1025
01:10:18,515 --> 01:10:20,290
Yeah, especially then.

1026
01:10:21,418 --> 01:10:24,058
A guy who don't stick up for his friends...

1027
01:10:24,087 --> 01:10:26,260
there ain't much to say for him.

1028
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:29,499
Right, Buck?

1029
01:10:51,148 --> 01:10:56,791
♫ I'm forever blowing ball games

1030
01:10:56,820 --> 01:11:00,632
♫ Pretty ball games in the air

1031
01:11:00,657 --> 01:11:03,365
♫ I come from Chi

1032
01:11:03,393 --> 01:11:05,600
♫ I hardly try

1033
01:11:05,629 --> 01:11:10,510
♫ Just go to bat,
and fade and die

1034
01:11:10,534 --> 01:11:13,777
♫ Fortune's coming my way

1035
01:11:13,804 --> 01:11:17,217
♫ That's why I don't care

1036
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:21,655
♫ I'm forever blowing ball games

1037
01:11:21,678 --> 01:11:27,128
♫ And the gamblers
treat us fair ♫♫

1038
01:11:32,589 --> 01:11:34,630
A crackpot.

1039
01:11:35,025 --> 01:11:37,335


1040
01:11:37,361 --> 01:11:40,831


1041
01:11:40,864 --> 01:11:43,936


1042
01:11:52,442 --> 01:11:56,083
Yes! Way to go, Joey!

1043
01:12:00,384 --> 01:12:02,261
Quiet! Quiet!

1044
01:12:02,285 --> 01:12:04,629
Kerr must have got out Knight or something.

1045
01:12:04,655 --> 01:12:06,726
They say it's tied
going into the eigth inning.

1046
01:12:06,757 --> 01:12:08,202
Wait a minute!

1047
01:12:10,994 --> 01:12:13,133
- Here we go, Chick!

1048
01:12:16,867 --> 01:12:18,540
Let's go! C'mon!

1049
01:12:19,836 --> 01:12:22,180
Play ball!

1050
01:12:22,205 --> 01:12:25,709
C'mon, Chickie baby!
We gotta do something here now, Chick.

1051
01:12:25,742 --> 01:12:28,086
C'mon, Chick!

1052
01:12:28,111 --> 01:12:31,115
C'mon, Chick, show me something.

1053
01:12:57,874 --> 01:13:00,484
Oh, shit.

1054
01:13:29,773 --> 01:13:31,719
It's open.

1055
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:35,956
Hey, Eddie.

1056
01:13:43,286 --> 01:13:44,663
How's it goin'?

1057
01:13:44,688 --> 01:13:45,826
Okay.

1058
01:13:45,856 --> 01:13:49,303
Still now word from Chick about the money.

1059
01:13:49,326 --> 01:13:51,670
I don't care about the money.

1060
01:13:51,695 --> 01:13:52,969
- Yeah.

1061
01:13:52,996 --> 01:13:56,239
Peculiar way to find that out, isn't it?

1062
01:14:03,673 --> 01:14:06,279
What are you going to
do out there tomorrow, Eddie?

1063
01:14:07,644 --> 01:14:09,749
I don't know yet.

1064
01:14:13,150 --> 01:14:15,106
I thought you were supposed to
be in charge of this thing.

1065
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:16,529
What happened to Sullivan?

1066
01:14:16,553 --> 01:14:19,159
He switched hotels.
We can't seem to track him down.

1067
01:14:19,189 --> 01:14:20,668
- And what happened to Attell?

1068
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:22,727
He says he shot his wad
in the third game when Kerr won.

1069
01:14:22,759 --> 01:14:24,329
He says he's busted.

1070
01:14:24,361 --> 01:14:25,840
Well, the hell with them then.

1071
01:14:25,862 --> 01:14:27,341
You two made an agreement.

1072
01:14:27,364 --> 01:14:29,037
Hey, we lose one more game and it's over.

1073
01:14:29,065 --> 01:14:31,671
We dumped four games,
I've only been paid for one.

1074
01:14:31,701 --> 01:14:32,771
You don't know what these guys are like.

1075
01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:37,343
Once you're in, you're in for good.
You can't welch on these guys!

1076
01:14:39,876 --> 01:14:42,584
It's your funeral, assholes.

1077
01:14:42,612 --> 01:14:43,886
Problems?

1078
01:14:45,315 --> 01:14:48,319
No. We still got Eddie.

1079
01:15:02,899 --> 01:15:05,175
Put it away, Eddie.
I'm going with Wilkinson today.

1080
01:15:08,138 --> 01:15:09,515
Why?

1081
01:15:09,539 --> 01:15:11,951
You haven't had the stuff lately,
have you.

1082
01:15:11,975 --> 01:15:13,852
But I feel alright today.

1083
01:15:13,877 --> 01:15:15,914
I can't take any chances. I'm sorry.

1084
01:15:15,946 --> 01:15:17,926
I say I can't lose.
That's how right i feel.

1085
01:15:17,948 --> 01:15:19,723
Sure you do, Eddie.

1086
01:15:19,749 --> 01:15:21,228
- Kid?

1087
01:15:21,251 --> 01:15:23,527
I can't miss.

1088
01:15:26,656 --> 01:15:28,329
Watch him.

1089
01:15:33,830 --> 01:15:36,106
Your move, Eddie.

1090
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:44,446
- Give it a change up.

1091
01:15:45,442 --> 01:15:47,388
- What a waste! You stink up the lawn!

1092
01:15:48,910 --> 01:15:50,767
- Go back home, Eddie!

1093
01:16:07,697 --> 01:16:10,507
How long do you think he'll go
before he dumps it?

1094
01:16:10,533 --> 01:16:11,841
Play ball!

1095
01:16:15,639 --> 01:16:17,676
Okay, Eddie baby, this is it!

1096
01:16:17,707 --> 01:16:19,380
It's up to you, Eddie baby.

1097
01:16:19,409 --> 01:16:21,719
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's get this guy, Eddie!

1098
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:25,892
Strike!

1099
01:16:27,117 --> 01:16:28,892
Forget it, Morey.

1100
01:16:31,721 --> 01:16:32,893
Strike!

1101
01:16:35,525 --> 01:16:37,505
Strike three! You're outa there!

1102
01:16:45,302 --> 01:16:46,804
You're out!

1103
01:16:46,836 --> 01:16:48,213
You're out!

1104
01:16:48,238 --> 01:16:50,445
One more!

1105
01:16:58,081 --> 01:17:00,618
Okay, Hap! That's the way!

1106
01:17:01,818 --> 01:17:03,058
Strike!

1107
01:17:03,086 --> 01:17:04,895
Strike!

1108
01:17:06,089 --> 01:17:07,727
Strike!

1109
01:17:07,757 --> 01:17:09,930
Two more men, eh?!

1110
01:17:12,395 --> 01:17:15,069
Yeah, let's go! That was a beauty!

1111
01:17:35,185 --> 01:17:38,496
C'mon, Eddie! Bring it on in there!
You got the power! You got the fire!

1112
01:17:38,521 --> 01:17:39,898
Give 'em another one!

1113
01:17:39,923 --> 01:17:42,494
C'mon, Eddie! One more batter!

1114
01:17:42,525 --> 01:17:45,028
Throw 'em a shine ball,
then blow it right by 'em.

1115
01:17:45,061 --> 01:17:47,337
Okay, Eddie baby, this is it!

1116
01:17:47,364 --> 01:17:49,571
It's up to you, Eddie!
Let's get this guy!

1117
01:17:49,599 --> 01:17:51,510
You got the fire!

1118
01:17:54,404 --> 01:17:55,508
Strike two!

1119
01:17:55,538 --> 01:17:57,711
Did you see that pitch?!

1120
01:17:57,741 --> 01:18:00,187
Okay, Eddie! One more, Eddie!

1121
01:18:00,210 --> 01:18:02,588
Let's get 'em!

1122
01:18:02,612 --> 01:18:05,855
Let's get 'em now, Eddie!

1123
01:18:05,882 --> 01:18:08,886
You got 'em! Bring it in here, Eddie!

1124
01:18:08,918 --> 01:18:09,988
Here we go, Eddie!!

1125
01:18:12,622 --> 01:18:13,862
You're out!

1126
01:18:13,890 --> 01:18:17,997
Alright, Eddie! Yes!

1127
01:18:18,028 --> 01:18:19,974
That's beautiful, Eddie!

1128
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:33,517
And I figured I ought to
save my blue-chip ball players.

1129
01:18:33,543 --> 01:18:35,614
If you've got faith in your fellas
they'll come around.

1130
01:18:35,645 --> 01:18:39,991
The Reds only need one more game to take
the series. That's do or die for your club.

1131
01:18:40,016 --> 01:18:43,156
No sweat.
- What makes you so confident, Kid?

1132
01:18:43,186 --> 01:18:44,824
I think the boys
are back on their form.

1133
01:18:44,854 --> 01:18:46,856
They've got the look of Moran's staff now.

1134
01:18:46,890 --> 01:18:49,097
And they'll be swinging free
from this point on.

1135
01:18:49,125 --> 01:18:51,935
I tell you, trust always
comes through in the clinchers.

1136
01:18:51,961 --> 01:18:55,636
Eddie came to me this morning and he said,
"Kid, I can't miss".

1137
01:18:55,665 --> 01:18:59,545
We got Lefty Williams pitching tomorrow.
One of the finest pitchers I ever seen.

1138
01:18:59,569 --> 01:19:01,139
Super big game, Lefty.

1139
01:19:01,171 --> 01:19:04,618
How do you explain the way your boys
laid down in the other games?

1140
01:19:04,641 --> 01:19:06,143
What do you mean, 'laid down'?

1141
01:19:06,176 --> 01:19:09,817
Well, they didn't seem
too enthusiastic about their jobs

1142
01:19:09,846 --> 01:19:12,053
- Nobody did any laying down.

1143
01:19:12,082 --> 01:19:15,086
Might have been a little overconfident...
Maybe we didn't have the fine edge...

1144
01:19:15,118 --> 01:19:16,756
but the boys have been putting out.

1145
01:19:16,786 --> 01:19:20,563
- The boys been put out
more than they've been putting out.

1146
01:19:20,590 --> 01:19:24,003
- You really think you can
turn this series around, Kid?

1147
01:19:24,027 --> 01:19:25,028
No sweat!

1148
01:19:25,061 --> 01:19:27,234
- The odds are pretty steep.

1149
01:19:27,263 --> 01:19:29,174
My boys don't care about the odds!

1150
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:33,375
Anything can happen in this game.
Anything!

1151
01:19:33,503 --> 01:19:35,813
So, you figure the boys
will be hitting tomorrow?

1152
01:19:35,839 --> 01:19:37,375
I sure hope so.

1153
01:19:37,407 --> 01:19:39,580
You gotta pitch
better than your last time out.

1154
01:19:39,609 --> 01:19:41,282
I suspect I will.

1155
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:42,847
Thank you very much.

1156
01:19:42,879 --> 01:19:44,517
You're welcome.

1157
01:19:45,949 --> 01:19:47,053
Hello, friend.

1158
01:19:47,083 --> 01:19:48,323
You want me to sign this, too?

1159
01:19:48,351 --> 01:19:49,830
You're going to lose tomorrow.

1160
01:19:49,853 --> 01:19:52,459
Oh, is that so.
- I know it for a fact.

1161
01:19:52,489 --> 01:19:54,491
Is that your wife?

1162
01:19:55,825 --> 01:19:57,463
Yeah, what's it to you?

1163
01:19:57,494 --> 01:19:59,804
You're going to lose tomorrow
or she dies.

1164
01:20:07,203 --> 01:20:10,207
Who sent you?
- You made a promise to certain people.

1165
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:12,686
You son of a bitch!
- You can't protect her.

1166
01:20:12,709 --> 01:20:15,053
If I don't do it, somebody else will.

1167
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,757
First inning, Mr. Williams.

1168
01:20:24,787 --> 01:20:26,824
What did he want, honey?

1169
01:20:26,856 --> 01:20:30,463
Oh, nothin'.
He just give me some advice

1170
01:20:30,493 --> 01:20:32,370
on how to pitch the game tomorrow.

1171
01:20:32,395 --> 01:20:34,636
Everybody's an expert.

♫ At the twilight's last gleaming?

1176

♫ Whose broad stripes and bright stars

1177
01:20:56,819 --> 01:21:00,392
♫ Through the perilous fight

1178

♫ O'er the ramparts we watched,

1179

♫ Were so gallantly streaming?

1180

♫ And the rocket's red glare

Excuse me, sir.

1188
01:22:06,489 --> 01:22:09,129
I would like to bet you
that my husband, Lefty Williams,

1189
01:22:09,158 --> 01:22:11,297
will pitch a no-hitter game.

1190
01:22:11,327 --> 01:22:13,671
Ma'am, in my opinion,
it won't go past the very first inning.

1191
01:22:13,696 --> 01:22:16,108
I will bet you $5.00.

1192
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:29,280


1193
01:22:48,264 --> 01:22:52,508
Okay, Lefty, bring it in!
Bring it in!

1194
01:22:56,205 --> 01:22:58,981
- Take a shower, Williams!

1195
01:22:59,008 --> 01:23:01,352
Bear down, Lefty! You can do it!

1196
01:23:06,416 --> 01:23:07,827
Ball.

1197
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:09,852
- Put the ball over the plate!

1198
01:23:11,821 --> 01:23:14,199
James, get your arm ready!

1199
01:23:21,532 --> 01:23:24,211
Shit!
What the hell are you throwing?

1200
01:23:53,796 --> 01:23:56,106
Nothin' but fast balls.

1201
01:23:56,132 --> 01:23:58,305
Slow ones.

1202
01:23:58,334 --> 01:24:00,336
James, your in.

1203
01:24:08,811 --> 01:24:11,849
Didn't take you long, did it, Lefty?

1204
01:24:16,652 --> 01:24:18,859
Told you it wouldn't go past the first.

1205
01:24:18,888 --> 01:24:20,333
Got a tip on it.

1206
01:24:22,925 --> 01:24:24,495
Thank you.

1207
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:40,150
- Cincinnati scores again.

1208
01:24:40,176 --> 01:24:43,123
Score is four to nothing.

1209
01:24:43,146 --> 01:24:46,787
Tough inning, huh?
- Yes, but they'll come through.

1210
01:24:46,816 --> 01:24:49,092
Comeback! Comeback!

maybe more.

Yup.

1217
01:26:05,928 --> 01:26:08,101
You had a damn fine series, Bucky.

1218
01:26:08,130 --> 01:26:09,575
We lost.

1219
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:14,506
We didn't get the breaks.

1220
01:26:14,537 --> 01:26:16,915
Maybe we just weren't good enough.

What's that mean?

1264
01:29:14,050 --> 01:29:17,725
Now, some kind of investigation
is going to be launched.

1265
01:29:17,753 --> 01:29:22,133
Our job is to control that investigation.

1266

In fact, to appear

You might not have to.
- They are guilty.

Well, that from a business point of view,
is irrelevant.

1270
01:29:32,034 --> 01:29:34,446
What's important is that
your business, baseball,

01:29:37,039 --> 01:29:39,246
unless you and your fellow owners
make the public think

1273
01:29:39,275 --> 01:29:41,846
that you are absolutely
clean in this matter.

1274
01:29:41,877 --> 01:29:43,686
How do we manage that?

1275
01:29:44,847 --> 01:29:47,418
- We felt that with
your record of service

1276
01:29:47,450 --> 01:29:49,760
and with the high esteem
the public holds for you--

1277
01:29:49,785 --> 01:29:51,765
We need a commission--

1278
01:29:51,787 --> 01:29:54,427
Someone outside of baseball...

1279
01:29:54,457 --> 01:29:56,960
who'd have certain powers to--

1280
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:59,438
Absolute power.

1281
01:29:59,462 --> 01:30:03,535
Absolute powers?
- It won't work any other way.

1282
01:30:03,566 --> 01:30:05,739
People won't believe it.

1283
01:30:05,768 --> 01:30:07,748
Absolute power.

1284
01:30:07,770 --> 01:30:09,750
Well, anyhow, we felt that the man

1285
01:30:09,772 --> 01:30:12,048
that cleaned the Reds
out of the country during the war

1286
01:30:12,074 --> 01:30:15,749
was the right man to clean up baseball.

1287
01:30:15,778 --> 01:30:17,621
We are prepared to offer you
a two year contract--

1288
01:30:17,646 --> 01:30:19,182
- Lifetime contract.

1289
01:30:19,215 --> 01:30:20,626
Lifetime?

1290
01:30:20,649 --> 01:30:23,892
A man worried about his job

1291
01:30:23,919 --> 01:30:26,229
is bound to play favorites.

1292
01:30:26,255 --> 01:30:28,201
You gentlemen don't want that, do you?

1293
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:30,898
But, a lifetime contract seems--

1294
01:30:34,563 --> 01:30:38,773
I'm back in court
in five minutes, gentlemen.

1295
01:30:38,801 --> 01:30:41,514
Let's talk salary.

1296
01:30:41,737 --> 01:30:44,183
A man, who in the dark days

1297
01:30:44,206 --> 01:30:46,447
of the last great conflict

1298
01:30:46,475 --> 01:30:48,955
made use of his official trust

1299
01:30:48,978 --> 01:30:53,051
to fight the Hun on these very shores.

1300
01:30:53,082 --> 01:30:57,189
A patriot of the first order.
A family man...

1301
01:30:57,219 --> 01:31:01,133
Landis used to lead the league
in reversed decisions.

1302
01:31:01,157 --> 01:31:03,763
He says he's gonna clean up baseball.

1303
01:31:03,793 --> 01:31:06,865
He can start with the birds
up on the stairs with him.

1304
01:31:06,896 --> 01:31:10,935
...over our all American pastime
of baseball.

1305
01:31:12,334 --> 01:31:14,871
It gives me great honor

1306
01:31:14,904 --> 01:31:22,288
to introduce Judge Kenesaw Mulkin Landis.

1307
01:31:26,115 --> 01:31:28,994
Read all about it! Baseball corrupt!
Read it here!

1308
01:31:29,018 --> 01:31:31,692
Grand jury called!
Read all about it!

1309
01:31:33,355 --> 01:31:35,801
So long, suckers.

1310
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:51,801
[ Practicing Spanish ]

1311
01:32:10,492 --> 01:32:12,904
Wait here, Mr. Cicotte.

1312
01:32:31,780 --> 01:32:33,050
- Eddie.

1313
01:32:33,082 --> 01:32:35,459
This is the man
handling the grand jury, Eddie.

1314
01:32:35,494 --> 01:32:38,763
He's got the goods on you.
Just come clean, he'll take care of you.

1315
01:32:38,787 --> 01:32:40,130
- Eddie.

1316
01:32:40,155 --> 01:32:41,828
- Sign this, Eddie.

1317
01:32:56,872 --> 01:32:58,579
I know what you wanna know.

1318
01:33:00,609 --> 01:33:02,919
I know.

1319
01:33:07,349 --> 01:33:09,556
Yeah, we were crooked.

1320
01:33:13,322 --> 01:33:15,563
We were crooked!

1321
01:33:19,528 --> 01:33:21,508
- What's the story?
- What can you tell us?

1322
01:33:21,530 --> 01:33:23,271
- Was it fixed, Eddie?

1323
01:33:23,299 --> 01:33:25,507
- Who was the brains, Eddie?
- Did you get immunity, Eddie?

1324
01:33:25,699 --> 01:33:27,907
For spilling the beans.
Did you get immunity?

1325
01:33:27,937 --> 01:33:29,075
What's that?

1326
01:33:29,104 --> 01:33:31,880
- They just wanna
clean up the gamblers, Joe...

1327
01:33:31,907 --> 01:33:33,409
not the ball players.

1328
01:33:35,377 --> 01:33:37,983
I gotta stay out of trouble.
- They don't want you in jail.

1329
01:33:38,013 --> 01:33:41,586
They want you to be a witness.
Now, you just sign right there.

1330
01:33:42,618 --> 01:33:43,653
My wife usually--

1331
01:33:43,686 --> 01:33:46,132
- You gotta sign to be a witness, Joe.
Everybody does.

1332
01:33:46,155 --> 01:33:49,295
Eddie signed it. Lefty...

1333
01:34:06,709 --> 01:34:09,656
- What's the scoop here, Hap?
- Yeah, the word is that you made a bundle!

1334
01:34:09,678 --> 01:34:11,385
Yeah, sure, I saw some cash.

1335
01:34:11,418 --> 01:34:13,785
They promised us all 20,000 each
and all I saw was 5.

1336
01:34:13,816 --> 01:34:16,057
What am I gonna do?
Call the cops?

1337
01:34:16,085 --> 01:34:19,191
- You looked pretty good out there
for a guy dumping games.

1338
01:34:19,221 --> 01:34:20,461
It's something that
must have come over me.

1339
01:34:20,489 --> 01:34:22,526
- You mean you
double-crossed the gamblers?

1340
01:34:22,558 --> 01:34:24,663
No. No, I'm a man of my word.

1341
01:34:24,693 --> 01:34:27,970
- So, why did you do it, Hap?
Somebody lean on you?

1342
01:34:27,997 --> 01:34:29,977
Everybody else was getting some.

1343
01:34:29,999 --> 01:34:32,000
I figured without the pitchers
we're going to lose anyway.

1344
01:34:32,034 --> 01:34:33,640
So, why shouldn't I get fat, too?

1345
01:34:33,669 --> 01:34:36,843
I may be dumb, fellas,
but I'm not stúpid.

1346
01:34:38,874 --> 01:34:41,650
Well, that wasn't so bad, was it, Joe?

1347
01:34:41,677 --> 01:34:43,953
Kinda felt good
to get it off my chest.

1348
01:34:43,979 --> 01:34:46,858
You did the right thing, Joe.
We're proud of you.

1349
01:34:46,882 --> 01:34:48,919
- What did you say, Joe?

1350
01:34:48,951 --> 01:34:51,591
- Were you in on it?

1351
01:34:51,620 --> 01:34:54,066
- C'mon, who was the big cheese?
Who did all the brain work?

1352
01:34:54,089 --> 01:34:55,899
- Why'd you wait so long
to spill it, Joe?

1353
01:34:55,933 --> 01:34:57,099
A hard guy.

1354
01:34:57,125 --> 01:34:58,427
Swede is a hard guy.
- Joe!

1355
01:34:59,528 --> 01:35:02,031
Say it ain't so, Joe.

1356
01:35:02,064 --> 01:35:04,510
Say it ain't so!

1357
01:35:07,770 --> 01:35:09,408
- Wait, Joe!

1358
01:35:09,438 --> 01:35:11,076
- Joe!

1359
01:35:11,106 --> 01:35:12,744
- Wait, Joe!

1360
01:35:12,775 --> 01:35:14,220
Joe...!

1361
01:35:27,756 --> 01:35:30,327
I'd like to introduce you
to Mr. Ben Short,

1362
01:35:30,359 --> 01:35:34,034
Mr. Tom Nash and Mr. Michael Ahearn.

1363
01:35:34,063 --> 01:35:35,872
Now, you may not be
familiar with their names

1364
01:35:35,898 --> 01:35:41,143
but I would say they are the Ty Cobb,
Tris Speaker and Zack Wheat

1365
01:35:41,170 --> 01:35:42,911
of the legal world.

1366
01:35:42,938 --> 01:35:44,975
Who's the Babe Ruth?

1367
01:35:45,007 --> 01:35:46,418
That's me.

1368
01:35:48,310 --> 01:35:52,349
Now, these are the men who are going to
be taking care of you during the trial.

1369
01:35:52,381 --> 01:35:54,884
You have only two choices.

1370
01:35:54,917 --> 01:35:58,865
Do exactly what we tell you to do
or go to jail.

1371
01:35:58,887 --> 01:36:01,595
You guys are such hot shots, you don't
come cheap. Who's footin' the bill?

1372
01:36:01,623 --> 01:36:05,127
Well, you boys have a lot of fans in this town.
Some of them are very wealthy people.

1373
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:06,264
How about a name?

1374
01:36:06,295 --> 01:36:09,037
Rule number one in a conspiracy trial...

1375
01:36:09,064 --> 01:36:13,746
The less you know,
the better off you are.

1376
01:36:13,969 --> 01:36:16,381
Mr. Rothstein feels

1377
01:36:16,405 --> 01:36:18,442
that he and your Mr. Comiskey

1378
01:36:18,474 --> 01:36:21,114
have certain interests in common.

1379
01:36:21,143 --> 01:36:22,952
Negative publicity can be very bad

1380
01:36:22,978 --> 01:36:25,117
for both of their businesses.

1381
01:36:25,147 --> 01:36:27,184
What does he want?

1382
01:36:27,216 --> 01:36:28,786
The confessions.

1383
01:36:31,386 --> 01:36:33,093
And, the players?

1384
01:36:33,122 --> 01:36:36,535
I'm certain you can help them understand
where their best interests lie.

1385
01:36:36,558 --> 01:36:38,333
They'll do what they're told.

1386
01:36:40,095 --> 01:36:43,235
If I had the jack
I'd get my own damn lawyer.

1387
01:36:43,265 --> 01:36:46,075
Commy won't let us
have our series bonuses.

1388
01:36:46,101 --> 01:36:48,672
Who do you think is paying
for the guys you've got?

1389
01:36:48,704 --> 01:36:50,581
Think it's Commy?

1390
01:36:53,175 --> 01:36:55,746
Put your shoulders back.

1391
01:36:55,777 --> 01:36:57,279
Of course it's him.

1392
01:36:57,312 --> 01:36:59,383
You think he's going to let
the best ball players in the game

1393
01:36:59,414 --> 01:37:02,952
slip away without a fight?

1394
01:37:02,985 --> 01:37:05,022
You look handsome.

1395
01:37:06,288 --> 01:37:09,201
I look like a future jailbird.

1396
01:37:09,224 --> 01:37:11,204
Sox trial starts today!

1397
01:37:11,226 --> 01:37:14,901
Get the news!
Trial starts for 'black' Sox!

1398
01:37:14,930 --> 01:37:17,433
Sox trial starts today!

1399
01:37:26,141 --> 01:37:28,246
It looks like schools's out.

1400
01:37:28,277 --> 01:37:29,517
There's Commy's lawyer.

1401
01:37:29,545 --> 01:37:31,718
He's got counsel lined up for the boys.

1402
01:37:31,747 --> 01:37:33,784
I thought Commy was
testifying against them.

1403
01:37:33,815 --> 01:37:35,624
Depends on which way the ball rolls.

1404
01:37:35,651 --> 01:37:37,028
If Commy says one thing

1405
01:37:37,052 --> 01:37:39,362
that will hurt him in the cash register,
I'll eat my hat.

1406
01:37:39,388 --> 01:37:42,164
Three signed confessions.
That's a tough hand to beat.

1407
01:37:42,191 --> 01:37:45,764
This is Chicago, my friend.
Anything can happen.

1408
01:37:45,794 --> 01:37:47,364
- Here they are!

1409
01:38:35,377 --> 01:38:37,323
Edward Cicotte...

1410
01:38:37,346 --> 01:38:39,826
Joseph Jefferson Jackson...

1411
01:38:39,848 --> 01:38:41,828
Arnold Gandil...

1412
01:38:41,850 --> 01:38:43,989
Charles Risberg...

1413
01:38:44,019 --> 01:38:46,329
Oscar Felsch...

1414
01:38:46,355 --> 01:38:48,494
Frederick McMullen...

1415
01:38:48,523 --> 01:38:50,332
Claude Williams...

1416
01:38:50,359 --> 01:38:52,532
and George Weaver are hereby accused

1417
01:38:52,561 --> 01:38:55,667
of conspiracy to
commit a confidence game

1418
01:38:55,697 --> 01:38:59,406
on one Charles Nims.

1419
01:38:59,434 --> 01:39:01,937
Who the hell is Charles Nims?

1420
01:39:01,970 --> 01:39:05,213
Some sucker who bet on us in the series.

1421
01:39:10,045 --> 01:39:13,618
When did you first
become aware of the conspiracy?

1422
01:39:13,649 --> 01:39:16,220
You mean the possibility of a conspiracy?

1423
01:39:16,251 --> 01:39:19,528
- Pardon me,
the possibility of a conspiracy.

1424
01:39:19,554 --> 01:39:21,591
Shortly after the series began.

1425
01:39:21,623 --> 01:39:22,897
And, you took no action?

1426
01:39:22,924 --> 01:39:25,302
I informed commissioner Ban Johnson,

1427
01:39:25,327 --> 01:39:28,308
I hired private detectives
to check on the players

1428
01:39:28,330 --> 01:39:31,311
and I personnaly kept
a scorecard of every game.

1429
01:39:31,333 --> 01:39:32,539
What did you find?

1430
01:39:32,567 --> 01:39:36,310
Hearsay. Nothing that would warrant

1431
01:39:36,338 --> 01:39:38,944
publically slandering honest ball players.

1432
01:39:40,475 --> 01:39:41,818
If they're honest.

1433
01:39:41,843 --> 01:39:43,584
So, you think they're innocent.

1434
01:39:43,612 --> 01:39:45,421
I'll abide by the ruling of the court.

1435
01:39:45,447 --> 01:39:48,223
- Why are you
appearing today for the prosecution?

1436
01:39:48,250 --> 01:39:51,493
I owe it to baseball.
- So, you are making an accusation.

1437
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:54,000
Not if they're innocent.
- But, you have suspicions.

1438
01:39:54,022 --> 01:39:57,333
They have been
indicted by a criminal court!

1439
01:39:57,359 --> 01:40:01,501
If that isn't suspicious,
I don't know what the heck is!

1440
01:40:04,399 --> 01:40:08,040
They pitched it to me.
They asked me if I knew somebody

1441
01:40:08,070 --> 01:40:10,482
willing to put up money
if they dumped the series.

1442
01:40:10,505 --> 01:40:12,212
- And, you made this connection?

1443
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:13,620
I know a few people.

1444
01:40:13,653 --> 01:40:16,120
- Did you ever stop to think
about the legality of your action?

1445
01:40:16,144 --> 01:40:19,387
Introducing people
who want to get together?

1446
01:40:19,414 --> 01:40:21,485
Bettin' on the Reds?

1447
01:40:21,516 --> 01:40:25,293
I was just acting on a tip
from inside dope, like any guy would.

1448
01:40:25,320 --> 01:40:28,358
And, how much did you profit
from your inside dope?

1449
01:40:28,390 --> 01:40:30,700
Not a red cent.

1450
01:40:30,726 --> 01:40:33,536
They busted me in the third game.

1451
01:40:33,562 --> 01:40:34,700
- So, the players doublecrossed you?

1452
01:40:34,730 --> 01:40:38,177
There's no honesty in this world.

1453
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:41,807
In fact, your reason for testifying
is revenge, isn't it, Bill?

1454
01:40:41,837 --> 01:40:44,943
If the players had really been crooked
and lost the third game

1455
01:40:44,973 --> 01:40:46,543
you would have been satisfied.

1456
01:40:46,575 --> 01:40:50,648
You think you're even with them now?
- I will be before I leave here.

1457
01:40:50,679 --> 01:40:53,660
You don't like me much, do you, Bill?

1458
01:40:53,682 --> 01:40:55,628
Sure I do, Ben.

1459
01:40:55,650 --> 01:40:58,631
If we'd a had a smart fellow like you
at the head of this deal

1460
01:40:58,653 --> 01:41:00,530
we'd all be rich now.

1461
01:41:04,593 --> 01:41:06,834
- Who was present at this meeting?

1462
01:41:06,862 --> 01:41:08,535
Chick Gandil...

1463
01:41:08,563 --> 01:41:10,099
Risberg...

1464
01:41:10,132 --> 01:41:12,134
Hap Felsch...

1465
01:41:12,167 --> 01:41:14,909
Cicotte,
Williams, McMullen...

1466
01:41:14,936 --> 01:41:16,438
and Buck Weaver.

1467
01:41:16,471 --> 01:41:18,212
Joe Jackson was not present?

1468
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:20,811
No, but he knew what was going on,

1469
01:41:20,842 --> 01:41:22,651
just like he said in the confession.

1470
01:41:22,677 --> 01:41:25,123
To what confession are you referring?

1471
01:41:25,147 --> 01:41:27,923
The confession he gave to the grand jury.

1472
01:41:27,949 --> 01:41:29,724
Can I ask that the prosecution

1473
01:41:29,751 --> 01:41:32,357
produce these alleged confessions?

1474
01:41:32,387 --> 01:41:34,128
Please bring them forward.

1475
01:41:35,557 --> 01:41:37,594
We don't have them, your honor.

1476
01:41:37,626 --> 01:41:39,572
They've been stolen.

1477
01:41:43,231 --> 01:41:44,232
Order!

1478
01:41:47,336 --> 01:41:48,947
Order!

1479
01:41:48,970 --> 01:41:51,712
Sit down, or I'm going to clear this court.

1480
01:41:51,740 --> 01:41:53,947
Must have cost somebody an arm and a leg.

1481
01:41:53,975 --> 01:41:55,977
Rothstein?
- Or Comiskey?

1482
01:41:56,011 --> 01:41:59,515
Or, maybe Rothstein's arm
and Comiskey's leg?

1483
01:42:00,916 --> 01:42:03,328


1484
01:42:07,055 --> 01:42:09,467
I want you to move out to the farm

1485
01:42:09,491 --> 01:42:11,471
if I go to jail.

1486
01:42:11,493 --> 01:42:13,700
You think they'll decide guilty?

1487
01:42:16,565 --> 01:42:18,875
I always figured it was talent

1488
01:42:18,900 --> 01:42:20,345
that made a man big, you know,

1489
01:42:20,368 --> 01:42:22,439
if I was the best at something?

1490
01:42:22,471 --> 01:42:25,145
I mean, we're the guys they come to see.

1491
01:42:25,173 --> 01:42:28,086
Without us there ain't a ball game.

1492
01:42:28,109 --> 01:42:31,090
Yeah, but look at who's holding the money
and look at who's facing a jail cell.

1493
01:42:31,112 --> 01:42:33,558
See, talent don't mean nothin'!

1494
01:42:35,116 --> 01:42:38,689
And, where's Comiskey and Sullivan...

1495
01:42:38,720 --> 01:42:40,563
Attell, Rothstein?

1496
01:42:42,123 --> 01:42:45,661
Out in the back room cuttin' up profits,
that's where.

1497
01:42:47,128 --> 01:42:49,574
That's the damn conspiracy.

1498
01:42:50,832 --> 01:42:52,243
- You woulda won, too.

1499
01:42:52,267 --> 01:42:55,214
You woulda beat those guys so easy.

1500
01:42:55,237 --> 01:42:58,582
Well, won't nobody ever know that now.

1501
01:43:03,144 --> 01:43:06,148
You lived and worked
with these men every day.

1502
01:43:06,181 --> 01:43:09,628
Shared trains and hotels and locker rooms.

1503
01:43:09,651 --> 01:43:11,961
And they never purposely or inadvertently

1504
01:43:11,987 --> 01:43:13,625
let slip of their plans?

1505
01:43:13,655 --> 01:43:14,998
I find that hard to believe.

1506
01:43:15,023 --> 01:43:18,800
Relations between me
and most of the defendants...

1507
01:43:18,827 --> 01:43:20,204
were strained.

1508
01:43:20,228 --> 01:43:21,298
- Why was that?

1509
01:43:21,329 --> 01:43:23,331
Personal differences.

1510
01:43:23,365 --> 01:43:25,507
And yet you were positive
that there was a fix on.

1511
01:43:25,565 --> 01:43:28,007
It sounds like you
had it in for the defendants.

1512
01:43:28,036 --> 01:43:30,949
I suspected there was a fix.
- You said you were positive.

1513
01:43:30,972 --> 01:43:32,212
No, you said that.

1514
01:43:32,240 --> 01:43:35,380
And, if you want, I can show you
where in the court transcript.

1515
01:43:36,978 --> 01:43:39,618
- On what were these suspicions based?

1516
01:43:39,648 --> 01:43:41,594
Some of the guys didn't seem to be

1517
01:43:41,616 --> 01:43:44,096
putting out 100%.

1518
01:43:44,119 --> 01:43:46,565
- Mr. Collins, have you ever played a game

1519
01:43:46,588 --> 01:43:50,126
when you were not in
peak mental and physical condition?

1520
01:43:50,158 --> 01:43:51,603
Occasionally.

1521
01:43:51,626 --> 01:43:54,069
Have you ever played a game
where you were distracted,

1522
01:43:54,106 --> 01:43:55,539
or upset,

1523
01:43:55,574 --> 01:43:57,641
and couldn't find it in you
to give your best effort?

1524
01:43:57,666 --> 01:43:59,202
No.

1525
01:43:59,234 --> 01:44:02,010
- Couldn't or didn't put out 100%?

1526
01:44:02,037 --> 01:44:04,210
Didn't give it the old 'college try'?

1527
01:44:04,239 --> 01:44:06,549
No, never.

1528
01:44:07,709 --> 01:44:10,713
Then you're a very remarkable man,
Mr. Collins.

1529
01:44:10,745 --> 01:44:13,419
Well, you said it, I didn't.

1530
01:44:13,448 --> 01:44:16,429
Your honor, please. Can I say something?
This man is not asking the right questions!

1531
01:44:16,451 --> 01:44:18,522
Can we have some order here, please?

1532
01:44:18,553 --> 01:44:20,157
Your bunchng us all together!
And, who is he to talk?

1533
01:44:20,188 --> 01:44:23,032
Collins wouldn't even hit his own weight!
Your honor, if it pleases the court...

1534
01:44:23,058 --> 01:44:25,095
Sit down, Bucky.
- Shut up!

1535
01:44:25,126 --> 01:44:27,504
If it pleases the court I would
like to take the stand.

1536
01:44:27,529 --> 01:44:29,372
You'll take the stand when you're called.

1537
01:44:29,397 --> 01:44:31,377
What if they don't call me?

1538
01:44:31,399 --> 01:44:34,039
- Please be seated.
- Wait a minute. What if they don't call me?

1539
01:44:34,069 --> 01:44:36,549
Be seated.
- Your honor, I want a separate trial!

1540
01:44:36,571 --> 01:44:39,177
The fact that I never took a penny
hasn't been brought up once!

1541
01:44:39,207 --> 01:44:40,845
I hit .327 in the series!

1542
01:44:40,875 --> 01:44:42,280
I didn't make an error!

1543
01:44:42,319 --> 01:44:44,880
I'm being charged with a conspiracy
I didn't have nothin' to do with!

1544
01:44:46,181 --> 01:44:50,220
Sit down, Mr. Weaver, or I'm going to
have to hold you in contempt of this court!

1545
01:44:50,251 --> 01:44:52,458
- C'mon, Buck. Sit down.

1546
01:44:52,487 --> 01:44:55,058
Nobody's interested in your batting average.

1547
01:44:58,193 --> 01:45:01,470
- Would the prosecution
care to cross examine?

1548
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:03,772
- No, your honor.

1549
01:45:06,468 --> 01:45:08,846
"Trial will continue tomorrow

1550
01:45:08,870 --> 01:45:11,248
"with 'black' Sox manager Kid Gleason

1551
01:45:11,272 --> 01:45:13,081
"expected to take the stand."

1552
01:45:13,108 --> 01:45:14,678
What's all this 'Black Sox' stuff?

1553
01:45:14,709 --> 01:45:17,383
Smart guys.
Reporters think they're smart guys.

1554
01:45:17,412 --> 01:45:20,188
All I wanna do is go back and play ball
and forget about it.

1555
01:45:21,583 --> 01:45:24,359
I don't know if they're
going to let you do that, Joe.

1556
01:45:24,386 --> 01:45:27,390
There's all this stuff about how
baseball can never have no cheaters.

1557
01:45:27,422 --> 01:45:29,129
I played good!

1558
01:45:29,157 --> 01:45:31,194
They gotta let me play!

1559
01:45:33,194 --> 01:45:35,470
If they don't, what are you all gonna do?

1560
01:45:38,700 --> 01:45:40,236
I don't know.

1561
01:46:00,155 --> 01:46:03,102
- How long were you a player
in the big leagues, Mr. Gleason?

1562
01:46:03,124 --> 01:46:06,662
A long time. Over 20 years.
I was a pitcher.

1563
01:46:06,695 --> 01:46:11,075
- As a pitcher you had a great deal
of control over the outcome of a game.

1564
01:46:11,099 --> 01:46:14,376
Well, sometimes the other team
had more control than I did...

1565
01:46:14,402 --> 01:46:17,815
but, yes. The pitcher, the catcher,
they had the most control.

1566
01:46:17,839 --> 01:46:21,218
- Were there gamblers involved in sports
in your day, Mr. Gleason?

1567
01:46:21,242 --> 01:46:22,846
Sure. How you gonna keep them out?

1568
01:46:22,877 --> 01:46:26,415
- Were there incidents
where games were thrown?

1569
01:46:27,615 --> 01:46:29,356
- I heard stories.

1570
01:46:29,384 --> 01:46:31,227
- Were you ever approached personally?

1571
01:46:31,252 --> 01:46:33,926
No. No, not personally.

1572
01:46:33,955 --> 01:46:37,562
I, uh... I had a reputation...

1573
01:46:37,592 --> 01:46:41,506
for being the kind of guy who
wouldn't go for something like that.

1574
01:46:41,529 --> 01:46:43,372
- So, you never had any thought

1575
01:46:43,398 --> 01:46:44,809
of instigating a deal?

1576
01:46:44,833 --> 01:46:46,710
Oh, no, no. I never--

1577
01:46:49,871 --> 01:46:52,613
I mean I can see, though, where a--

1578
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:56,452
Well, maybe if a guy feels
he's being underpaid and, uh, maybe...

1579
01:46:56,478 --> 01:47:01,723
falls in with the wrong kind of people
and they feed him a line how he could--

1580
01:47:03,785 --> 01:47:06,129
You know, people are human.

1581
01:47:06,154 --> 01:47:08,395
But, I never--

1582
01:47:08,423 --> 01:47:10,926
Well, not that I'm a 'holy Joe'...
Nothin' like that--

1583
01:47:10,959 --> 01:47:12,495
- You don't have to apologize

1584
01:47:12,527 --> 01:47:14,734
for being honest, Mr. Gleason.

1585
01:47:14,763 --> 01:47:16,640
Yeah.

1586
01:47:16,664 --> 01:47:18,735
- Well...

1587
01:47:18,767 --> 01:47:22,681
What do you think of these
players of yours now, Mr. Gleason?

1588
01:47:33,314 --> 01:47:37,194
I think they're the greatest ball club
I ever seen. Period.

1589
01:48:08,616 --> 01:48:09,890
Hey, Buck.

1590
01:48:09,918 --> 01:48:11,955
Hi, fellas.

1591
01:48:11,986 --> 01:48:14,227
Seen you outside court today.

1592
01:48:14,255 --> 01:48:16,792
Some circus, huh?

1593
01:48:16,825 --> 01:48:19,305
Is it true what they're sayin' in there?

1594
01:48:19,327 --> 01:48:21,307
About Joe and the others.

1595
01:48:21,329 --> 01:48:24,469
Don't be too down on the guys, fellas.

1596
01:48:24,499 --> 01:48:28,174
When you grow up things get...
complicated.

1597
01:48:28,203 --> 01:48:30,581
You didn't do nothin' wrong, did you, Buck?

1598
01:48:31,940 --> 01:48:33,544
Guess I never grew up.

1599
01:48:43,985 --> 01:48:46,226
I still get such a bang out of it...

1600
01:48:46,254 --> 01:48:47,733
playing ball.

1601
01:48:48,923 --> 01:48:51,529
Same as I did when I first come up.

1602
01:48:51,559 --> 01:48:54,438
When you get out there
and the stands are full...

1603
01:48:54,462 --> 01:48:56,237
everybody's cheering.

1604
01:48:57,665 --> 01:49:01,010
It's like everybody in the world
come to see you.

1605
01:49:01,035 --> 01:49:04,482
Then, inside, the players...
They're yacking it up.

1606
01:49:04,505 --> 01:49:06,610
The pitcher throws...

1607
01:49:06,641 --> 01:49:09,417
You look for that 'pill'...

1608
01:49:09,444 --> 01:49:12,550
and suddenly there's nothing else
in the ballpark except you and it.

1609
01:49:14,215 --> 01:49:16,957
And, sometimes, when you feelin' right...

1610
01:49:16,985 --> 01:49:18,692
there's a groove there...

1611
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:21,599
and the bat just eases into it

1612
01:49:21,623 --> 01:49:23,694
and meets that ball.

1613
01:49:23,725 --> 01:49:27,138
When the bat meets that ball you
can see that ball just give...

1614
01:49:27,161 --> 01:49:30,540
You know it's gonna go a long way.

1615
01:49:30,565 --> 01:49:33,205
Damn! It feels like
you're gonna live forever.

1616
01:49:38,206 --> 01:49:40,413
You couldn't give that up.

1617
01:49:42,143 --> 01:49:44,214
Not for nothin'.

1618
01:49:46,314 --> 01:49:48,453
How do you think their
going to call it tomorrow?

1619
01:49:50,218 --> 01:49:53,995
You stay out at third base next season you're
going to see Buck Weaver playing his butt off!

1620
01:49:54,022 --> 01:49:55,626
Yeah!

1621
01:49:59,427 --> 01:50:02,203
"The aforementioned parties
are also accused

1622
01:50:02,230 --> 01:50:04,904
"of conspiracy to
commit a confidence game,

1623
01:50:04,933 --> 01:50:09,780
"an offense which, in this case, carries
a maximum penalty of five years in jail

1624
01:50:09,804 --> 01:50:12,307
" and a $2,000 fine."

1625
01:50:12,340 --> 01:50:13,944
- Does anyone have a statement to make

1626
01:50:13,975 --> 01:50:15,955
before the final verdict is made?

1627
01:50:15,977 --> 01:50:17,888
I do, your honor.

1628
01:50:17,912 --> 01:50:20,518
- Very well. Mr. Weaver.

1629
01:50:20,548 --> 01:50:22,459
I want to put on the record somewhere

1630
01:50:22,483 --> 01:50:25,396
that I asked for a separate trial
and I was refused.

1631
01:50:25,420 --> 01:50:28,162
That evidence of my playing
in world series games was not admitted,

1632
01:50:28,189 --> 01:50:31,102
and that I never got a chance
to take the stand on my own behalf.

1633
01:50:31,125 --> 01:50:32,832
It will be so noted.

1634
01:50:32,860 --> 01:50:34,965
A big setup!

1635
01:50:37,231 --> 01:50:38,767
Will the foreman read the veredict?

1636
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:40,939
Yes, your honor.

1637
01:50:42,971 --> 01:50:46,578
We find the defendants...

1638
01:50:46,607 --> 01:50:49,986
not guilty on all charges.

1639
01:50:58,553 --> 01:51:00,794
That was a bigger fix than the series.

1640
01:51:00,822 --> 01:51:03,928
Gamblers 8, baseball nothing.

1641
01:51:07,628 --> 01:51:09,767
You got your ball club back, Commy!

1642
01:51:09,797 --> 01:51:12,539
I will make them pay for this!

1643
01:51:44,032 --> 01:51:45,511
- Hey, Chick!

1644
01:51:45,533 --> 01:51:47,513
Hey, small world, huh?!

1645
01:51:47,535 --> 01:51:49,640
Well done!

1646
01:51:49,670 --> 01:51:51,343
Make room for the 'clean' Sox!

1647
01:51:53,674 --> 01:51:55,722
How you feeling, Joe?
- Like a million bucks!

1648
01:51:56,145 --> 01:52:00,516
I've seen some lawyerin' in my day, but you
people in Chicago got some lawyerin' birds!

1649
01:52:00,554 --> 01:52:03,654
Those guys could talk a  buffalo
off a nickel if they put their minds to it!

1650
01:52:03,684 --> 01:52:07,632
What did I tell you, partner?
It was in the bag all the time.

1651
01:52:10,158 --> 01:52:12,434
"Regardless of the veredict of juries...

1652
01:52:14,062 --> 01:52:17,737
"no player who throws a ball game...

1653
01:52:17,765 --> 01:52:21,542
"no player who undertakes
or promises to throw a game...

1654
01:52:22,537 --> 01:52:24,312
"no player who sits in conference

1655
01:52:24,338 --> 01:52:27,911
"with a bunch of
crooked players and gamblers...

1656
01:52:27,942 --> 01:52:32,220
"where the ways and means
of throwing a ball game are discussed,

1657
01:52:32,246 --> 01:52:36,126
"and does not promptly
tell his club about it,

1658
01:52:36,150 --> 01:52:40,724
"will ever play
professional baseball again."

1659
01:52:42,590 --> 01:52:44,092
To baseball!

1660
01:53:01,175 --> 01:53:02,916
- Ball!

1661
01:53:02,944 --> 01:53:05,185
Fellow's playing kind of
shallow in center, isn't he?

1662
01:53:05,213 --> 01:53:06,317
He's new.

1663
01:53:06,347 --> 01:53:09,851
Damned if that doesn't look like him.

1664
01:53:09,884 --> 01:53:11,727
Look like who?

1665
01:53:11,752 --> 01:53:13,561
Nah, couldn't be.

1666
01:53:13,588 --> 01:53:16,330
He's gonna get burned
playing in so close.

1667
01:53:28,269 --> 01:53:31,216
How did he get back there?!
- Who is that guy?

1668
01:53:33,908 --> 01:53:35,319
It is. It's him!

1669
01:53:35,343 --> 01:53:38,119
What's his name... the new guy?
- He don't look so new to me.

1670
01:53:38,146 --> 01:53:39,819
It says his name is Brown.

1671
01:53:39,847 --> 01:53:42,054
A name is easy to change.
It's him.

1672
01:53:42,083 --> 01:53:44,029
Who is 'him'?

1673
01:53:44,051 --> 01:53:45,689
It's Joe Jackson.

1674
01:53:45,720 --> 01:53:47,597
What?!
- Get outa here!

1675
01:53:47,622 --> 01:53:49,033
- Who's Joe Jackson?

1676
01:53:49,056 --> 01:53:51,229
- Look at how he's hitting us.
He's killing us out there.

1677
01:53:51,259 --> 01:53:53,205
A double. Two home runs.

1678
01:53:53,227 --> 01:53:56,231
These bushers make peanuts, Les.
Jackson made a fortune on those games.

1679
01:53:56,264 --> 01:53:57,641
It's him!

1680
01:53:57,665 --> 01:53:59,076
You ever see him play?

1681
01:53:59,100 --> 01:54:00,477
Yeah, I saw pictures.

1682
01:54:00,501 --> 01:54:02,071
Pictures!

1683
01:54:03,504 --> 01:54:05,006
- I saw him play.

1684
01:54:06,040 --> 01:54:07,246
Yeah?

1685
01:54:08,576 --> 01:54:10,214
What do you think?

1686
01:54:12,280 --> 01:54:13,691
He was the best!

1687
01:54:14,949 --> 01:54:16,587
Run, hit, throw...

1688
01:54:17,652 --> 01:54:19,563
He was the best.

1689
01:54:23,558 --> 01:54:24,559
So, what do you think?

1690
01:54:25,393 --> 01:54:26,736
Is that him?

1691
01:54:28,496 --> 01:54:29,634
Nah.

1692
01:54:31,632 --> 01:54:33,976
Those fellows are all gone now.

1693
01:54:41,572 --> 01:54:44,279
Home run!

1694
01:54:47,848 --> 01:54:48,826
- Stand up!

1695
01:54:48,849 --> 01:54:50,487
You got it beat!

1696
01:54:50,518 --> 01:54:51,758
Safe!

1697
01:54:54,589 --> 01:54:57,126
- Yeah. Brown, huh?

1698
01:54:57,158 --> 01:54:58,762
- Who is Joe Jackson?

1699
01:54:58,793 --> 01:55:02,400
One of the guys who
threw the series back in '19.

1700
01:55:02,430 --> 01:55:04,933
One of them bums from Chicago, kid.

1701
01:55:04,966 --> 01:55:07,173
One of the 'black' Sox.

1702
01:59:40,051 --> 01:59:41,690
