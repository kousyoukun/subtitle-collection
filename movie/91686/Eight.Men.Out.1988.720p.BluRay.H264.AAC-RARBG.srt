1
00:02:47,645 --> 00:02:48,646
Bucky!

2
00:02:54,151 --> 00:02:55,755
Bucky!

3
00:02:57,955 --> 00:02:59,400
Bucky!

4
00:03:01,392 --> 00:03:02,769
Bucky!

5
00:03:04,962 --> 00:03:07,841
I got it, Bucky! We're in!

6
00:03:07,865 --> 00:03:10,141
I got me the 2 bits!
We're in!

7
00:03:10,167 --> 00:03:11,373
How'd you get it?

8
00:03:11,402 --> 00:03:13,905
Hawking papers.
C'mon, it's starting!

9
00:03:13,938 --> 00:03:16,544
We're going to see the Sox!

10
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,787
Two bleachers.
- Two bleachers.

11
00:03:24,815 --> 00:03:26,158
Thank you.

12
00:03:26,183 --> 00:03:27,355
Three, please.

13
00:03:31,455 --> 00:03:32,798
Safe!

14
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:37,032
We'll divvy it up.
Two makes heavy dough.

15
00:03:37,061 --> 00:03:40,008
These are the best seats in the joint!
- You bet!

16
00:03:48,806 --> 00:03:51,223
If Cicotte's arm holds up it will be murder.

17
00:03:51,475 --> 00:03:54,149
Better get movin', boys.
Commy's forum is in the clubhouse.

18
00:03:54,178 --> 00:03:58,991
Commy sure knows the way to a writer's heart.
- Sports writers of the world, unite!

19
00:03:59,016 --> 00:04:01,963
You have nothing to lose
but your bar privileges.

20
00:04:01,986 --> 00:04:03,761
Here comes the old Roman.

21
00:04:03,787 --> 00:04:07,200
Hello, my boys! Everybody happy?

22
00:04:07,224 --> 00:04:08,703
Hi, Billy!

23
00:04:08,726 --> 00:04:11,070
Tommy! Smitty!

24
00:04:11,095 --> 00:04:12,403
Hey, sourpuss.

25
00:04:13,798 --> 00:04:14,904
So, Hughie?

26
00:04:15,132 --> 00:04:18,204
- Ban Johnson says he's pretty sure
your boys are going to win.

27
00:04:18,235 --> 00:04:20,806
No question <i>if</i>  my boys will win.

28
00:04:20,838 --> 00:04:23,079
Just a matter of how many games
it's going to take 'em.

29
00:04:23,107 --> 00:04:24,518
Think it'll go the full nine?

30
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:27,022
Nine games? Not a chance.

31
00:04:27,044 --> 00:04:28,853
You sound pretty cocky.

32
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:33,055
I got the horses, Smitty.
I got the horses.

33
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:37,031
And, more than that,
I got the team, fellas!

34
00:04:37,054 --> 00:04:39,559
Kid Gleason has done a heck of
a job at the helm this year,

35
00:04:39,598 --> 00:04:41,059
bringing these boys together.

36
00:04:41,091 --> 00:04:44,095
Smoothing out the defense.
Building up the offense.

37
00:04:44,128 --> 00:04:46,972
Getting the boys to think and move together.

38
00:04:46,997 --> 00:04:49,443
Hell! They eat together, travel together,

39
00:04:49,466 --> 00:04:51,104
room together on the road

40
00:04:51,135 --> 00:04:52,478
and when it's time to play
they let off steam together.

41
00:04:52,503 --> 00:04:55,109
No room for prima donnas in this ball club!

42
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:58,052
Every man for the good of the team!

43
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,884
Out!

44
00:05:04,515 --> 00:05:05,516
You're out!

45
00:05:09,987 --> 00:05:11,625
That one wake you up, Collins?

46
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,101
Hey, "college boy" needs his beauty sleep.

47
00:05:16,126 --> 00:05:18,372
What for?
He goes to bed at 9:00 o'clock.

48
00:05:18,406 --> 00:05:20,598
Wouldn't hurt you guys
to get a little sleep once in a while.

49
00:05:20,631 --> 00:05:22,338
Shove it, "college boy".

50
00:05:22,366 --> 00:05:24,209
It's like a family, ya know?

51
00:05:24,234 --> 00:05:25,941
What about the odds on your boys?

52
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,179
It's already 3 to 1 in their favor.

53
00:05:29,206 --> 00:05:32,881
They are... underestimating us.

54
00:05:35,412 --> 00:05:40,657
Any bet against my Sox this series
is a sucker bet.

55
00:05:40,684 --> 00:05:42,357
Of course, I'm not a gambling man.

56
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,634
Collins?
- Nah.

57
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:52,072
"College boy" is the only one on the club
who's getting paid what he's worth.

58
00:05:52,096 --> 00:05:54,992
Tied it in his contract
when he got traded.

59
00:05:57,034 --> 00:05:58,911
C'mon... Go!

60
00:06:04,475 --> 00:06:09,891
Hey, mister! Hey, mister!
You made my brother spill his Cracker Jacks!

61
00:06:09,913 --> 00:06:11,756
Mister!

62
00:06:11,782 --> 00:06:14,262
- Here, kid. Shut him up, will ya?

63
00:06:17,588 --> 00:06:19,590
- What about Chick Gandil?

64
00:06:22,826 --> 00:06:24,066
He might do business.

65
00:06:24,094 --> 00:06:25,903
Chickie's a sport.

66
00:06:25,929 --> 00:06:28,967
Gandil? Only first sack in the league
doesn't need his glove to play.

67
00:06:28,999 --> 00:06:30,910
Hands of steel.

68
00:06:30,934 --> 00:06:32,709
I'll put my Joe Jackson...

69
00:06:32,736 --> 00:06:34,909
up against any player in the circuit.

70
00:06:34,938 --> 00:06:38,613
The boy can hit...
he can run... he can throw.

71
00:06:38,642 --> 00:06:40,781
- If he could read he'd be perfect.

72
00:06:42,546 --> 00:06:45,083
C'mon, Betsy, it needs a walk now.
Big walk.

73
00:06:45,115 --> 00:06:47,061
Tell me when, Betsy.

74
00:06:48,052 --> 00:06:49,725
Does it ever talk back to you, Joe?

75
00:06:51,355 --> 00:06:53,164
- He probably sleeps with it, too.

76
00:06:54,992 --> 00:06:56,528
Lay off, you guys.

77
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,631
Ah, you crackers stick together, huh?

78
00:06:58,662 --> 00:07:00,335
- Ask him for a triple, Joe.

79
00:07:00,364 --> 00:07:01,434
Did you hear me?

80
00:07:01,465 --> 00:07:05,345
Sixty years since the civil war, Lefty.
Ease up.

81
00:07:05,369 --> 00:07:07,940
Besides, you guys lost.
It's in all the papers.

82
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:09,848
That wouldn't help Jackson, though.

83
00:07:10,941 --> 00:07:12,443
Just leave 'em be.

84
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:17,959
What are you lookin' at, busher?

85
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,558
Here he comes!

86
00:07:24,588 --> 00:07:26,659
C'mon, Joe! Nail it!

87
00:07:28,325 --> 00:07:29,827
- Hey, professor...

88
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,669
read any good books lately?

89
00:07:32,763 --> 00:07:34,709
- Hey, professor...!

90
00:07:43,941 --> 00:07:45,249
Run, Joe, run!

91
00:07:45,275 --> 00:07:47,050
C'mon go, go, go!

92
00:07:50,614 --> 00:07:53,561
C'mon, take it!

93
00:07:53,584 --> 00:07:55,291
C'mon, Joe, slide!

94
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:56,525
Safe!

95
00:07:56,823 --> 00:08:00,501
Whoopee!
Whoopee! Way to go, Joe!

96
00:08:00,624 --> 00:08:04,629
- Hey, Jackson! Hey, Jackson!

97
00:08:04,661 --> 00:08:06,004
Can you spell "Cat"?

98
00:08:08,398 --> 00:08:11,607
C'mon "Shoeless Joe",
can you spell "Cat"?

99
00:08:11,635 --> 00:08:14,912
Hey, mister, can you spell "Shit"?

100
00:08:20,744 --> 00:08:22,849
Buck Weaver?

101
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,553
Bucky is one of the boys.

102
00:08:24,581 --> 00:08:28,085
But, the thing about Bucky is
he don't like to lose.

103
00:08:28,118 --> 00:08:29,791
Everyone's standing up!

104
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,026
Here.

105
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,564
C'mon, Buck! Repeat Joe's!

106
00:08:43,267 --> 00:08:44,541
Out!

107
00:08:46,837 --> 00:08:50,250
He can't stand to lose.
Put him on the "maybe list".

108
00:08:52,176 --> 00:08:53,746
What about Schalk?

109
00:08:53,777 --> 00:08:55,347
- Not a prayer.

110
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:58,019
Listen, Ray, settle a bet
between me and Hap, will ya?

111
00:08:58,048 --> 00:09:00,961
He says everybody knows how to smile.
Even you.

112
00:09:00,984 --> 00:09:05,023
And I said your puss would crack
if you ever tried.

113
00:09:05,055 --> 00:09:07,057
Go piss up a rope.

114
00:09:11,128 --> 00:09:13,938
OK, Eddie! C'mon, ball five, Eddie!

115
00:09:13,964 --> 00:09:15,671
Ball five. Here we go, Eddie!

116
00:09:15,699 --> 00:09:18,475
- Eddie Cicotte has had
his control back this year.

117
00:09:18,502 --> 00:09:20,812
And I think his record speaks for itself.

118
00:09:20,838 --> 00:09:25,218
I wouldn't be surprised if he's got two,
maybe three good seasons left in that arm.

119
00:09:34,718 --> 00:09:36,322
Foul ball!

120
00:09:39,556 --> 00:09:43,698
C'mon, Eddie. Let's make a lot of noise.
Let's just make a lot of noise, Eddie!

121
00:09:43,727 --> 00:09:45,070
C'mon, get it in here, Eddie.

122
00:09:45,095 --> 00:09:48,235
Here we go. Here we go, Eddie.

123
00:09:48,265 --> 00:09:51,075
C'mon, fast as you can, Eddie!

124
00:09:51,101 --> 00:09:52,705
Let's get it. Let's get it!

125
00:10:01,912 --> 00:10:03,687
Foul ball!

126
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,921
C'mon, Knuckles.
Don't make me nervous.

127
00:10:09,152 --> 00:10:11,359
Keep it down there.
Keep it down there, Eddie!

128
00:10:11,388 --> 00:10:14,096
Hey, frag arm! Frag arm!

129
00:10:14,124 --> 00:10:17,333
Hey, old man! Get a rockin' chair!

130
00:10:17,361 --> 00:10:19,705
OK, Eddie, one more strike.
Don't worry about it!

131
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,334
Their luck is running thin.

132
00:10:21,365 --> 00:10:23,402
Pitch it right in there!
One more ace, c'mon!

133
00:10:23,433 --> 00:10:25,379
OK, let's do it, Eddie!

134
00:10:25,402 --> 00:10:27,348
Big five, Eddie.

135
00:10:27,371 --> 00:10:30,215
Here we go! Big five, Eddie!

136
00:10:32,843 --> 00:10:34,322
Strike three!

137
00:10:34,344 --> 00:10:36,824
50 years of baseball.

138
00:10:36,847 --> 00:10:39,623
He's got the best knuckle ball
I've ever seen.

139
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:43,552
If he's such a fan why doesn't he
pay him a living wage?

140
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,357
Eddie's getting old for this game.

141
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:50,133
I know the feeling when you walk
out on the mound with your arm hanging.

142
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,869
You couldn't pitch
when you were young, Burnsy.

143
00:10:53,897 --> 00:10:57,504
Eddie is the key.
We don't get Eddie, we forget about it.

144
00:10:57,534 --> 00:10:59,104
- OK, Eddie, let's finish 'em off here now!

145
00:11:14,384 --> 00:11:16,420
We're going to the series!

146
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:22,596
A guy could knock his brains out doing that.

147
00:11:22,626 --> 00:11:24,003
What brains?

148
00:11:24,027 --> 00:11:27,839
"Shoeless Joe" is ignorant.
Hap Felsch is dumb.

149
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,744
Jesus, Hap. Save it, will ya?

150
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:34,646
Save it for what?

151
00:11:47,818 --> 00:11:49,320
- Stay hungry, you guys.

152
00:11:55,892 --> 00:11:58,031
Uh, what's the scoop, Harry?

153
00:11:58,061 --> 00:12:00,541
Mr. Comiskey sent these down to you.

154
00:12:00,564 --> 00:12:03,602
His congratulations
for a successful pennant race.

155
00:12:03,633 --> 00:12:05,544
Ah, that's white of him.

156
00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:07,575
He didn't happen to mention when

156
00:12:07,669 --> 00:12:10,575
we could expect that bonus he promised us
if we took the flag, did he?

157
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:13,352
This is your bonus.

158
00:12:17,681 --> 00:12:20,059
Cheap bastard.

159
00:12:21,985 --> 00:12:26,297
Fellows, if it was up to me --
- Kid, we got no beef with you.

160
00:12:28,692 --> 00:12:30,797
It's flat.

161
00:12:35,999 --> 00:12:38,605
To the old Roman,
Charles Comiskey.

162
00:12:38,635 --> 00:12:41,013
To Commy! To Commy!
- Beat their pants off, Commy.

163
00:12:41,038 --> 00:12:43,109
To the Sox!

164
00:12:49,012 --> 00:12:50,958
Hey, Buck.

165
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,499
- Hey, Winslow.

166
00:12:58,522 --> 00:12:59,592
Gentlemen.

167
00:12:59,623 --> 00:13:02,001
Winslow, your boys look sharp.
- Yeah.

168
00:13:02,025 --> 00:13:05,199
They're the best I've seen yet.

169
00:13:05,228 --> 00:13:08,437
The best white folks team, anyways.

170
00:13:08,465 --> 00:13:12,140
I say they're the best, Hughie.
The best ever.

171
00:13:12,169 --> 00:13:14,279
Time will tell, kid.

172
00:13:14,504 --> 00:13:16,710
Time will tell.

173
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:20,019
C'mon, fellas,
pretend this is Commy's wake.

"The Sox assured the best of the 9".

186
00:13:56,213 --> 00:13:59,092
Don't want me to skip and
find what they talk about you?

187
00:13:59,116 --> 00:14:00,993
Start from the beginning, baby.

188
00:14:01,017 --> 00:14:03,759
"Now that we have
put the Hun in his place

189
00:14:03,787 --> 00:14:08,668
it is time for Americans to turn their
attentions to more pleasurable pastimes".

190
00:14:12,896 --> 00:14:14,739
Hey, they're sayin' we got no bench.

191
00:14:14,764 --> 00:14:16,243
That's you they're talking about.

192
00:14:16,266 --> 00:14:18,974
- Hey, if Gleason puts me on,
I'm gonna put a hole through them Reds.

193
00:14:19,002 --> 00:14:21,573
Yeah? You going to fart at 'em
or swing a bat?

194
00:14:22,572 --> 00:14:24,848
Hey, wise guy. Pow!

195
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,912
Hey, Freddie got
the best hands in the league.

196
00:14:26,943 --> 00:14:30,117
I never once seen him drop a mug of beer
once he's got his mitts on it.

197
00:14:31,114 --> 00:14:33,185
Look at the way he fits this stool.

198
00:14:33,216 --> 00:14:37,426
That's a professional bench warmer's butt
if ever I've seen one.

199
00:14:37,454 --> 00:14:40,094
I hear you're quite a performer, Mr. Gandil.

200
00:14:40,123 --> 00:14:44,196
Yeah. I ain't bad on the diamond, neither.

201
00:14:44,227 --> 00:14:47,538
They say you don't even
need a glove to catch a ball.

202
00:14:47,564 --> 00:14:49,601
Let me see your hands.

203
00:14:49,633 --> 00:14:51,635
Look at them mitts, ladies.

204
00:14:51,668 --> 00:14:54,012
You should have been a pug, Chickie,
with mitts like that.

205
00:14:54,037 --> 00:14:56,415
Oh, I done some scrappin'.

206
00:15:00,343 --> 00:15:02,949
- Spiffy lookin' bird is "Sport" Sullivan.

207
00:15:02,979 --> 00:15:05,823
Anything that moves in Boston,
he's got a bet down on it.

208
00:15:05,849 --> 00:15:07,351
Think he's beat us to it?

209
00:15:07,784 --> 00:15:11,730
Nah. He's just fishing around
for some inside dope, is all.

210
00:15:14,224 --> 00:15:15,897
- My nose is broke...

211
00:15:15,926 --> 00:15:19,738
my eyes is swelled up so bad
I can't hardly see.

212
00:15:19,763 --> 00:15:23,233
And somehow I bust the guy square
with this upper cut.

213
00:15:23,266 --> 00:15:24,836
He goes down.

214
00:15:24,868 --> 00:15:28,839
Somebody shoves 50 bucks in my hand.
50 bucks!

215
00:15:28,872 --> 00:15:32,684
I'm stepping on something
and it's the other guy's teeth.

216
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:34,814
"What's he get?", I say.

217
00:15:34,844 --> 00:15:37,482
Referee kneels over the guy and he says,

218
00:15:37,513 --> 00:15:41,826
"From the look of his jaw,
he gets a liquid diet for 6 weeks".

219
00:15:45,655 --> 00:15:47,692
Now, what we should have done...

220
00:15:47,724 --> 00:15:50,261
was waltz around for a few rounds...

221
00:15:50,293 --> 00:15:53,274
then one of us takes a turn

222
00:15:53,296 --> 00:15:55,742
and we split 25 bucks apiece later on.

223
00:15:55,765 --> 00:15:57,802
And nobody gets hurt.

224
00:16:00,136 --> 00:16:02,207
Chickie is smart money.

225
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:05,311
Whenever I'm in town,
he's the man I see.

226
00:16:05,342 --> 00:16:09,916
- If you don't play the angles,
you're a sap.

227
00:16:12,582 --> 00:16:18,225
Say, why don't you ladies
go powder your noses for awhile?

228
00:16:18,255 --> 00:16:20,661
The way I figure it
that son of a bitch Comiskey's

228
00:16:20,695 --> 00:16:22,761
the only one that's going to
make a killing on this deal.

229
00:16:22,792 --> 00:16:25,102
It's his ball club, his stadium.

230
00:16:25,128 --> 00:16:27,404
His grass, his dirt, his air.

231
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,432
In fact, Commy owns you, Buck.

232
00:16:29,466 --> 00:16:32,606
I'm surprised he ain't got you all
doing yard work for him in the off season.

233
00:16:32,636 --> 00:16:34,411
Nobody owns me.

234
00:16:34,437 --> 00:16:35,415
- That's a laugh.

235
00:16:35,438 --> 00:16:36,940
Claude?

236
00:16:36,973 --> 00:16:38,475
You're getting paged, Lefty.

237
00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:41,814
It's time, Claude. You promised.

238
00:16:51,888 --> 00:16:55,301
Gleason caught him sneaking back
at the Cruxie one night in Philly.

239
00:16:55,325 --> 00:16:57,168
Asked him what his wife would think

240
00:16:57,193 --> 00:16:59,070
and he said that's who he'd gone to see.

241
00:16:59,095 --> 00:17:01,132
His own wife on the road?

242
00:17:02,365 --> 00:17:03,673
Pitiful.

243
00:17:05,302 --> 00:17:06,781
Just supposing...?

244
00:17:06,803 --> 00:17:08,282
Yes--

245
00:17:08,305 --> 00:17:10,683
You'd need at least 2 starting pitchers...

246
00:17:10,707 --> 00:17:13,313
a couple of infielders...

247
00:17:13,343 --> 00:17:16,051
a couple of heavy hitters.

248
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,787
I mean, if you really want to be sure.

249
00:17:18,815 --> 00:17:20,852
What about the Sox?

250
00:17:24,654 --> 00:17:26,861
Six, maybe seven, they'd go for it.

251
00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:32,197
I'd say you'd need at least 10,000 apiece.

252
00:17:32,228 --> 00:17:36,005
Of course, who could put
that kind of money together?

253
00:17:36,032 --> 00:17:37,670
I could.

254
00:17:39,836 --> 00:17:43,943
You go back to Boston and
turn 70,000 at the drop of a hat?

255
00:17:43,973 --> 00:17:46,180
I find that hard to believe.

256
00:17:46,209 --> 00:17:48,587
You say you can find seven men

257
00:17:48,611 --> 00:17:50,750
on the best club
that ever took the field

258
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,989
willing to throw the world series?

259
00:17:54,017 --> 00:17:56,429
I find <i>that</i>  hard to believe

260
00:17:56,453 --> 00:17:59,662
You never played with Charlie Comiskey.

261
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:09,267
♫ <i>I see you flirt
with some frail skirt</i>

262
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:14,248
♫ <i>And I'm in a purple rage</i>

263
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:17,740
♫ <i>White hot passion's</i>

264
00:18:17,774 --> 00:18:20,448
♫ <i>Been the fashion</i>

265
00:18:20,477 --> 00:18:25,222
♫ <i>Since the old golden days</i>... ♫♫

266
00:18:25,749 --> 00:18:29,492
It would take 4 seasons
sweating it out for Commy to make 10,000.

267
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:32,966
Now, if we did get an advance,
put it down on the Reds...

268
00:18:32,989 --> 00:18:36,061
It gets heavy odds--
it starts to multiply.

269
00:18:36,092 --> 00:18:38,402
Just a couple of games we're talking,
or the whole series?

270
00:18:38,428 --> 00:18:40,635
That's one thing that
we'd have to work out.

271
00:18:40,663 --> 00:18:42,870
Now, the way I figure it--

272
00:18:44,367 --> 00:18:45,710
Hey, guys.

273
00:18:45,735 --> 00:18:47,214
Damn!

274
00:18:48,304 --> 00:18:50,341
Freddie...

275
00:18:50,373 --> 00:18:54,253
You oughtn't creep around like that, pal.
You made Chick wet his pants.

276
00:18:54,277 --> 00:18:55,585
How about letting me in?

277
00:18:55,612 --> 00:18:58,163
In what? What are you talking about?

278
00:18:58,224 --> 00:19:01,004
Whatever you guys got goin'.

279
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,338
The fix.

280
00:19:02,385 --> 00:19:05,244
You're in, Freddie.
- What?

281
00:19:05,288 --> 00:19:08,816
You want in, Freddie? You're in.

282
00:19:08,858 --> 00:19:11,761
Now, if you can just
leave us alone here...

283
00:19:11,795 --> 00:19:13,775
we've got some things to iron out.

284
00:19:13,877 --> 00:19:16,193
Sure, Swede.

285
00:19:16,232 --> 00:19:17,233
Freddie.

286
00:19:17,267 --> 00:19:19,124
Keep a lid on it, eh?

287
00:19:19,169 --> 00:19:22,548
Sure, Swede. You know me.

288
00:19:25,842 --> 00:19:28,618
Listen.
I know he's your buddy and all, but--

289
00:19:28,645 --> 00:19:30,352
- He's in.

290
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,827
Swede, hey.
He's not even going to play.

291
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:36,797
Chick... He's in.

292
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,894
Okay, he's in.

293
00:19:43,927 --> 00:19:45,531
What next?

294
00:19:45,562 --> 00:19:49,271
Chick Gandil! Hey, long time no see!

295
00:19:50,266 --> 00:19:52,337
Bill Burns. Remember me?

296
00:19:53,336 --> 00:19:55,976
Oh yeah. Right, yeah.

297
00:19:56,005 --> 00:20:00,385
Listen, Chick, long as I'm here there are
a couple of things I'd like to pitch to you.

298
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:03,289
He'll chase after almost anything
with 2 strikes on him.

299
00:20:03,313 --> 00:20:06,851
I saw him whip on a curve in the dirt
against the Cubs last month.

300
00:20:06,883 --> 00:20:09,363
Congratulations, fellas.
Hell of a season.

301
00:20:09,385 --> 00:20:10,864
Thanks, Hughie.

302
00:20:10,887 --> 00:20:13,367
Surprised to see you fellows in a gin mill.

303
00:20:13,389 --> 00:20:14,800
- It's a celebration.

304
00:20:14,824 --> 00:20:16,462
The whole team should be here.

305
00:20:16,493 --> 00:20:20,339
Ginger ale. I had some of this once.

306
00:20:20,363 --> 00:20:21,603
I think I was 6. Maybe 7.

307
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:25,477
Suppose that's what
they're drinking over there?

308
00:20:30,607 --> 00:20:33,713
Everybody's got their own
way of letting off steam, Ring.

309
00:20:33,743 --> 00:20:36,280
It's what you do on the field that counts.

310
00:20:39,082 --> 00:20:42,825
So, if the thing with "Sport" falls through
we can try them two birds.

311
00:20:42,852 --> 00:20:44,957
Why don't we just deal with them both?

312
00:20:44,988 --> 00:20:48,765
That way it's twice the payoff
for the same games.

313
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:51,965
Well, what if they
find out about each other?

314
00:20:51,995 --> 00:20:55,772
Big deal. What are they going to do?
Call the cops?

315
00:20:58,401 --> 00:21:01,905
Six or seven guys, $10,000 each?

316
00:21:01,938 --> 00:21:05,909
One guy who's got the scratch
to back that kind of action.

317
00:21:05,942 --> 00:21:07,387
Rothstein?

318
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:11,381
If we can get Rothstein
and they get Eddie Cicotte--

319
00:21:13,249 --> 00:21:15,490
Eddie. Eddie's the man.

320
00:21:17,453 --> 00:21:18,796
Real bad?

321
00:21:19,822 --> 00:21:21,733
No worse than it's been.

322
00:21:21,758 --> 00:21:24,432
We'll get you rested pretty soon.

323
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,701
I'll dose three games in the series.

324
00:21:26,729 --> 00:21:29,266
You'll do fine. You always do.

325
00:21:33,403 --> 00:21:37,442
Every time I throw the fast ball
I feel it all the way down my spine.

326
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:41,052
And the knuckler--

327
00:21:41,077 --> 00:21:43,648
Well, you know, I try to put it
where it don't wanna go.

328
00:21:44,647 --> 00:21:47,491
Some days it just does what it wants to.

329
00:21:47,517 --> 00:21:51,124
You always worry and you always do fine.

330
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,767
Hi, girls.

331
00:21:55,792 --> 00:21:59,001
Your daddy's going to
pitch in the world series.

332
00:22:09,572 --> 00:22:11,210
- Hey, Mr. Weaver.

333
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,015
Don't you fellas never go home?

334
00:22:13,042 --> 00:22:15,120
We saw you play today.

335
00:22:15,445 --> 00:22:17,425
Here's your 2 bits back.

336
00:22:17,447 --> 00:22:19,290
I stunk up the joint.

337
00:22:20,283 --> 00:22:23,059
Nah. You'll straighten up
before the series.

338
00:22:23,086 --> 00:22:24,463
Sure.

339
00:22:24,487 --> 00:22:28,333
His name's <i>Bucky</i>. We named him
after you on account you're his favorite.

340
00:22:28,358 --> 00:22:31,066
No kiddin'?
- "Shoeless Joe" is my favorite.

341
00:22:31,094 --> 00:22:34,906
Joe's a heck of a player.
- Can you show me some tricks?

342
00:22:36,499 --> 00:22:37,978
No, it's gettin' kind of late.

343
00:22:38,001 --> 00:22:40,038
I gotta go. The wife, you know.

344
00:22:40,069 --> 00:22:41,546
Please?

345
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,180
Alright.

346
00:22:48,211 --> 00:22:49,815
Get on your third sack and stance.

347
00:22:49,846 --> 00:22:51,291
Sure thing, Mr. Weaver.

348
00:22:51,314 --> 00:22:54,318
Buck. Call me Buck.
Ready?

349
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,387
Bend your knees.

350
00:23:04,394 --> 00:23:08,672
Forget it. I make 6,000 a year.
A lot of people are out of work.

351
00:23:08,698 --> 00:23:12,407
How old are you, Eddie?
How long is the arm going to hold up?

352
00:23:12,435 --> 00:23:13,709
Arm's fine.

353
00:23:13,736 --> 00:23:16,444
You got hurt Commy  wouldn't even
pay your train fare home.

354
00:23:16,472 --> 00:23:18,418
What do you do then?

355
00:23:18,441 --> 00:23:20,751
I hear you're planning on
sending those girls of yours to college.

356
00:23:20,777 --> 00:23:23,223
Lookit, Chick, will you
just get off my back.

357
00:23:24,213 --> 00:23:26,159
Just hear me out, will ya?

358
00:23:26,182 --> 00:23:29,652
Hey, what's your hurry?
- I got a meeting with the old man.

359
00:23:29,686 --> 00:23:32,428
Right now?
- Yes. Five, please.

360
00:23:32,455 --> 00:23:34,025
You wouldn't say nothin',
would you, Eddie?

361
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:39,337
- You said if I won 30 games this year

362
00:23:39,362 --> 00:23:41,171
there'd be a 10,000 dollar bonus.

363
00:23:41,197 --> 00:23:42,175
So?

364
00:23:42,198 --> 00:23:45,008
I think you owe it to me.

365
00:23:45,034 --> 00:23:49,278
Harry, how many games did
Mr. Cicotte win for us this year?

366
00:23:51,641 --> 00:23:53,416
29, sir.

367
00:23:53,443 --> 00:23:58,392
You had Kid bench me for 2 whole
weeks in August. I missed 5 starts.

368
00:23:58,414 --> 00:24:00,257
We had to rest your arm for the series.

369
00:24:00,283 --> 00:24:03,287
I would have won
at least 2 of those games.

370
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:04,730
You knew that.

371
00:24:04,754 --> 00:24:09,328
I have to keep the best
interests of the club in mind, Eddie.

372
00:24:11,394 --> 00:24:13,734
I think you owe me that bonus.

373
00:24:13,996 --> 00:24:17,842
29 is not 30, Eddie.

374
00:24:17,867 --> 00:24:21,337
You will get only the money you deserve.

375
00:24:23,172 --> 00:24:24,845
Anything else?

376
00:24:26,743 --> 00:24:30,520
No, Mr. Comiskey, that's it.

377
00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:14,029
10,000.

378
00:25:15,024 --> 00:25:16,526
Huh?

379
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,539
Before the first game.

380
00:25:19,729 --> 00:25:21,402
Cash.

381
00:25:22,532 --> 00:25:23,943
What?

382
00:25:25,201 --> 00:25:26,839
You heard me.

383
00:25:47,623 --> 00:25:52,299
That's him, Burnsy. I seen him fight once,
just before he lost his featherweight title.

384
00:25:52,328 --> 00:25:55,468
Held some kid up for three rounds
until he could drop the decision.

385
00:25:55,498 --> 00:25:57,102
It takes a real artist

386
00:25:57,133 --> 00:25:59,670
to dump a fight without hitting the canvas.

387
00:26:06,776 --> 00:26:09,882
See, I told you, Bill,
it's the little champ.

388
00:26:09,912 --> 00:26:12,654
They don't take
nickel bets down here, fellas.

389
00:26:12,682 --> 00:26:14,025
Abe Attell, right?

390
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:17,361
You.
You were a ball player.

391
00:26:17,386 --> 00:26:20,924
Bill Burns.
- "Sleepy" Bill Burns.

392
00:26:20,957 --> 00:26:22,527
Strictly bench material.

393
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:26,131
I won a few games.
- You lost a few more.

394
00:26:26,162 --> 00:26:29,575
And, you my friend,
did not get that nose bobbing for apples.

395
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:32,978
I'm a fighter, sort of.
- Sort of.

396
00:26:33,002 --> 00:26:36,176
Let's see... Philly?

397
00:26:36,205 --> 00:26:37,206
Yeah.

398
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,913
Billy Maharg!

399
00:26:38,941 --> 00:26:42,855
You seen me fight?
- Yeah, I seen ya. You're a bum!

400
00:26:42,879 --> 00:26:44,017
Hey.

401
00:26:44,046 --> 00:26:45,650
Yeah!

402
00:26:45,681 --> 00:26:47,524
So, wadda you 2 birds want with me?

403
00:26:48,684 --> 00:26:51,187
Word is you work for Arnold Rothstein.

404
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:55,293
We got a proposition to make.
Could be big money.

405
00:26:55,324 --> 00:26:59,101
Well, I'm Mr. Rothstein's ears,
so let's hear it.

406
00:27:08,371 --> 00:27:10,081
No dice.

407
00:27:11,207 --> 00:27:12,414
No dice.

408
00:27:12,942 --> 00:27:15,513
You're a practical man, Lefty.
You can see the advantages.

409
00:27:15,544 --> 00:27:17,319
- Claude, who's that?

410
00:27:17,346 --> 00:27:19,656
We got Cicotte in the bag already.

411
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,156
The hell you do!

412
00:27:22,184 --> 00:27:24,061
He's in, Lefty. You can ask him.

413
00:27:24,086 --> 00:27:26,692
Eddie can dump 3 games all on his own.

414
00:27:26,722 --> 00:27:29,498
The thing is done, Lefty.
With you or without you.

415
00:27:30,493 --> 00:27:32,996
We just didn't want to
leave you out of the payday.

416
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:36,241
If you got Eddie...

417
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,542
you got me, too.

418
00:27:42,338 --> 00:27:45,751
- Claude! Who is that?

419
00:27:45,775 --> 00:27:47,311
Salesman.

420
00:27:47,343 --> 00:27:50,688
- Well, whatever he's selling,
we don't want none.

421
00:27:54,216 --> 00:27:57,390
Maxie Schwartz and "Irish Tommy" Flynn.

422
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,024
Very tough boys.

423
00:27:59,055 --> 00:28:01,057
What's the action on them?

424
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:04,435
- Both are young and stupid.
Trying to make it the hard way.

425
00:28:06,963 --> 00:28:08,840
I'd lay off if I was you.

426
00:28:08,864 --> 00:28:10,343
Fight's on the level, huh?

427
00:28:11,767 --> 00:28:12,745
Listen, A.R...

428
00:28:12,768 --> 00:28:14,941
this serie thing
those 'ham and eggers' pitched--

429
00:28:14,971 --> 00:28:16,575
Not interested.

430
00:28:16,605 --> 00:28:19,176
We could see a good hunk of change on it.

431
00:28:20,376 --> 00:28:24,347
If it's Burns and Maharg you're worried about,
we could just cut them out and do it ourselves.

432
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,223
Word gets out Arnold Rothstein

433
00:28:26,248 --> 00:28:29,786
is betting against the Sox,
what happens to the odds?

434
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:32,561
They drop down the john,
but I can bet through these guys.

435
00:28:32,588 --> 00:28:35,569
How long do you think they're
going to keep their mouths shut?

436
00:28:35,591 --> 00:28:38,572
20 minutes?
Half hour? What?

437
00:28:38,594 --> 00:28:41,165
Yeah, but, they got six guys, maybe seven.

438
00:28:41,197 --> 00:28:43,803
Doesn't surprise me.

439
00:28:43,833 --> 00:28:45,312
But, they're the champs.

440
00:28:45,334 --> 00:28:47,814
You were the champ once, Abe.

441
00:28:47,837 --> 00:28:49,908
You went down for the bucks.

442
00:28:49,939 --> 00:28:52,146
This is different.

443
00:28:53,876 --> 00:28:57,380
Look, champ, I know who these guys are.

444
00:28:57,413 --> 00:28:59,222
I grew up with guys like that.

445
00:29:00,516 --> 00:29:02,462
I was the fat kid they wouldn't let play.

446
00:29:02,485 --> 00:29:04,931
"Sit down fat boy",
that's what they tell me.

447
00:29:04,954 --> 00:29:08,595
"Sit down. Maybe you'll learn something".

448
00:29:08,624 --> 00:29:10,900
Well, I learned something, alright.

449
00:29:10,926 --> 00:29:14,669
Pretty soon I owned the game.

450
00:29:14,697 --> 00:29:18,736
And, those guys I come up with, they come
to me now with their hats in their hands.

451
00:29:19,902 --> 00:29:21,609
Tell me, champ.

452
00:29:21,637 --> 00:29:25,312
All those years of pugging,
how much you make?

453
00:29:25,341 --> 00:29:27,617
The honest fights, or the ones I tanked?

454
00:29:27,643 --> 00:29:31,523
Altogether I must have made 10 times more
betting on you  than you did slugging it out.

455
00:29:31,547 --> 00:29:33,549
I never took a punch.

456
00:29:33,582 --> 00:29:35,653
Yeah, but I was champ.

457
00:29:35,684 --> 00:29:38,722
Featherweight champion of the world.

458
00:29:38,754 --> 00:29:40,529
Yesterday.

459
00:29:42,158 --> 00:29:44,138
That was yesterday.

460
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,162
No, A.R., you're wrong.

461
00:29:47,363 --> 00:29:51,675
I was champ
and can nothin' take that away.

462
00:29:57,907 --> 00:29:59,818
Now, about this fix thing.
Maybe if we--

463
00:29:59,842 --> 00:30:02,015
I'm not interested, Abe.

464
00:30:07,483 --> 00:30:09,019
I gotta go get me some air.

465
00:30:09,051 --> 00:30:10,052
I'll see you later.

466
00:30:25,534 --> 00:30:27,514
Grammercy 8439.

467
00:30:28,971 --> 00:30:32,612
8...4...3...9.

468
00:30:33,742 --> 00:30:35,050
Right.

469
00:30:38,414 --> 00:30:39,825
Nat?

470
00:30:39,849 --> 00:30:41,522
A.R.

471
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:45,498
Tell your Mr. Sullivan
he can stop by tonight.

472
00:30:45,521 --> 00:30:48,161
Have him use the servant's entrance.

473
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,601
Yeah, he's in...

474
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:51,502
but, he wants his name kept out of this.

475
00:30:51,527 --> 00:30:53,165
Mr. Rothstein don't like publicity.

476
00:30:53,195 --> 00:30:54,538
- No problem.

477
00:30:54,563 --> 00:30:58,101
'Cuz if this gets out the
odds go to shit and he goes off it .

478
00:30:58,134 --> 00:31:01,377
Gandil wants $100,000 for the players.

479
00:31:01,403 --> 00:31:04,907
That shouldn't be any
problem for Arnold Rothstein.

480
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:08,444
No. It's a cinch.

481
00:31:10,412 --> 00:31:13,518
Yeah, yeah, I understand, Joey.
My heart bleeds.

482
00:31:13,549 --> 00:31:15,927
But, Mr. Rothstein's been
carrying you on this for months now

483
00:31:15,951 --> 00:31:18,932
and you ain't come back with a nickel.

484
00:31:18,954 --> 00:31:21,025
That's right,
I'm collecting for him now.

485
00:31:21,056 --> 00:31:23,229
What, you'd rather talk
with Monk Eastman?

486
00:31:25,261 --> 00:31:29,676
No, no, Joey. I don't expect
the whole 40,000 right up front.

487
00:31:29,698 --> 00:31:34,147
But, listen, Joey, how about 10 or 15
as a gesture of good faith?

488
00:31:36,071 --> 00:31:38,950
It makes me happy
to hear you say that, Joey.

489
00:31:43,179 --> 00:31:44,556
Come in.

490
00:31:48,184 --> 00:31:49,807
Mr. Rothstein.

491
00:31:50,012 --> 00:31:51,502
Let's hear it.

492
00:31:51,941 --> 00:31:54,164
It's the series, Mr. Rothstein.

493
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:57,001
Seems to be a popular topic today.

494
00:31:57,193 --> 00:32:01,569
I can get eight men in,
including Cicotte.

495
00:32:01,897 --> 00:32:04,004
So, what do you need me for?

496
00:32:04,133 --> 00:32:07,114
Well, I'm a big man in Boston...

497
00:32:07,136 --> 00:32:09,912
but, Boston's a small town.

498
00:32:09,939 --> 00:32:11,680
The kinda cash that I need--

499
00:32:11,707 --> 00:32:14,779
A man shouldn't bite off
more than he can chew.

500
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:19,623
People watch what you do
real close, Mr. Rothstein.

501
00:32:19,648 --> 00:32:25,257
If you, or one of your people,
were to bet heavily on the Reds, well--

502
00:32:25,287 --> 00:32:29,133
If I lay the action, the odds stay fat.

503
00:32:29,158 --> 00:32:31,104
And, there's no direct link.

504
00:32:31,126 --> 00:32:33,402
Go home.

505
00:32:33,429 --> 00:32:36,376
Don't do anything until you hear from me.

506
00:32:40,169 --> 00:32:42,115
Yes, sir.

507
00:32:45,174 --> 00:32:47,176
Good night, Mr. Rothstein.

508
00:32:56,252 --> 00:32:58,612
Big man in Boston.

509
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:03,903
You should've seen his place, Jimmy.

510
00:33:03,926 --> 00:33:06,770
Them big bankrolls.

511
00:33:06,795 --> 00:33:09,298
I never seen the like of it
outside of a museum.

512
00:33:11,667 --> 00:33:13,908
Message from Mr. Rothstein.

513
00:33:15,271 --> 00:33:16,511
You--

514
00:33:16,538 --> 00:33:18,484
go away.

515
00:33:18,507 --> 00:33:19,508
- Jimmy...

516
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:22,215
go get me some cigarettes for the trip.

517
00:33:22,244 --> 00:33:24,224
Sure.

518
00:33:28,751 --> 00:33:31,391
Mr. Rothstein says he's in.

519
00:33:32,221 --> 00:33:33,894
40,000 to the players, up front.

520
00:33:36,525 --> 00:33:39,904
You hold the other 40
'til they blow the series.

521
00:33:39,928 --> 00:33:42,340
Tell Cicotte to hit the first batter

522
00:33:42,364 --> 00:33:43,809
if the fix is on.

523
00:33:43,832 --> 00:33:46,506
Anybody connects Mr. Rothstein with this,

524
00:33:46,535 --> 00:33:48,776
I come see you again.

525
00:33:48,804 --> 00:33:50,681
You don't want that.

526
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:55,244
You tell Mr. Rothstein he's got my word.

527
00:34:02,418 --> 00:34:04,261
I never knew you smoked, Sport.

528
00:34:04,286 --> 00:34:06,492
Holy mother.

529
00:34:06,922 --> 00:34:10,699
When you look at it, Jimmy,
all spread out like that...

530
00:34:10,726 --> 00:34:13,832
Whose is it?
- Who do you think?

531
00:34:13,862 --> 00:34:17,708
I want you to take this 20,000
back to Boston.

532
00:34:17,733 --> 00:34:19,406
I want you to go over to Mullcahy.

533
00:34:19,435 --> 00:34:21,346
You know the password.

534
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:24,874
I want you to put it all
down on Cincinnati for the first game.

535
00:34:24,907 --> 00:34:26,944
Tell him it's just a hunch I've got.

536
00:34:26,975 --> 00:34:28,010
Some hunch!

537
00:34:28,043 --> 00:34:31,081
Then, I want you to
take this to McGinnis.

538
00:34:31,113 --> 00:34:34,253
And, you tell him
you're sure I've gone crazy...

539
00:34:34,283 --> 00:34:37,560
but, I want to place
10 big ones on the Reds

540
00:34:37,586 --> 00:34:39,190
for the whole show.

541
00:34:39,221 --> 00:34:40,825
I'm laying bets for Rothstein?

542
00:34:40,856 --> 00:34:42,858
You're laying bets for me.

543
00:34:42,891 --> 00:34:45,955
That thievin' jew don't know it,
but he just givin' me a loan.

544
00:34:45,994 --> 00:34:47,565
Well, then what's left for the players?

545
00:34:47,607 --> 00:34:49,962
Jimmy, you know what you feed
a dray horse in the morning

546
00:34:49,998 --> 00:34:51,875
if you want a day's work out of him?

547
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,004
- What?

548
00:34:53,035 --> 00:34:56,994
Just enough so he knows he's hungry.

549
00:35:03,812 --> 00:35:05,382
Fellas.
- Hey, Ring.

550
00:35:07,082 --> 00:35:09,722
Hey, boys.
- Hughie.

551
00:35:09,752 --> 00:35:11,732
Hey, you guys want in on this?

552
00:35:11,754 --> 00:35:15,133
No. I hear Gandil deals from the bottom.

553
00:35:15,157 --> 00:35:16,727
Good luck with the Reds, fellas.

554
00:35:16,759 --> 00:35:18,329
Thanks, Ring.

555
00:35:22,931 --> 00:35:24,501
Hey, fellas.
- Hi, Ring.

556
00:35:24,533 --> 00:35:26,877
Good luck. Knock 'em dead.

557
00:35:26,902 --> 00:35:28,040
Hiya, Eddie.

558
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,451
How's the old soup bone feeling?

559
00:35:33,475 --> 00:35:34,818
Uh... Bad.

560
00:35:34,843 --> 00:35:38,484
- Hughie's bringing his nest-egg down
to lay it on you birds for the series.

561
00:35:38,514 --> 00:35:41,290
Ha. He shouldn't ought to do that.

562
00:35:41,316 --> 00:35:43,421
Anything can happen in baseball.

563
00:35:43,452 --> 00:35:45,329
Hughie's a lucky man.

564
00:35:46,522 --> 00:35:48,763
Luck won't have nothin' to do with it.

565
00:35:48,791 --> 00:35:49,792
- Eddie?

566
00:35:51,994 --> 00:35:53,530
Excuse me, Ring.

567
00:35:56,799 --> 00:35:58,369
- C'mon, it's in the bag.

568
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,937
I just wanted to let you and Buck
in on the take.

569
00:36:00,969 --> 00:36:03,779
In on what take?
- Sounds like you're already in pretty deep.

570
00:36:03,806 --> 00:36:07,447
C'mon, Hap. We lose a couple of games,
we make 20,000 dollars.

571
00:36:07,476 --> 00:36:09,012
A couple, or the whole bit?

572
00:36:09,044 --> 00:36:11,115
Hey, whoa, whoa!
What are you guys talking about?

573
00:36:11,146 --> 00:36:14,821
What about Jackson?
- Swede's pitching him now. He'll come around.

574
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:17,126
You can be sure if Joe ain't in, I ain't in.

575
00:36:17,152 --> 00:36:20,065
So what if they find you're dealing double?
You cross a guy like Rothstein

576
00:36:20,088 --> 00:36:22,762
they're gonna find you in the gutter
with your toes curled up.

577
00:36:22,791 --> 00:36:24,361
Hey, fellas...

578
00:36:24,393 --> 00:36:26,373
Who's this?!

579
00:36:26,395 --> 00:36:28,671
Anyone care for a drink?

580
00:36:31,834 --> 00:36:33,472
- Hey, Joe.

581
00:36:33,502 --> 00:36:34,503
Hi.

582
00:36:43,078 --> 00:36:46,116
I stare at it 'til the eye goes blind.

583
00:36:47,152 --> 00:36:51,024
Oh...
What then?

584
00:36:51,353 --> 00:36:53,397
Do the other one.

585
00:36:56,692 --> 00:36:59,571
It's good for my batting eye.

586
00:37:01,864 --> 00:37:03,241
Something wrong?

587
00:37:04,466 --> 00:37:06,776
Hey, you're the doctor.

588
00:37:06,802 --> 00:37:11,714
Listen, Joe. We got together, most of
the guys. And the thing is, uh...

589
00:37:12,341 --> 00:37:14,617
we're going to drop
a couple of games in the series.

590
00:37:17,179 --> 00:37:18,214
Who?

591
00:37:18,247 --> 00:37:20,022
Oh, everybody.

592
00:37:20,048 --> 00:37:24,190
Chick, me, Cicotte, Lefty--
- Lefty?

593
00:37:24,219 --> 00:37:28,292
Sure, Lefty.
And Fred and Hap and Bucky.

594
00:37:28,323 --> 00:37:30,064
Everybody.

595
00:37:30,092 --> 00:37:32,572
And Joe... some of them--

596
00:37:32,594 --> 00:37:34,596
I won't name names, but--

597
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,938
I had to tell them no.

598
00:37:35,964 --> 00:37:39,138
We can't leave Joe out of this.
He's one of us.

599
00:37:39,167 --> 00:37:41,408
You want me?

600
00:37:41,436 --> 00:37:43,814
We need you, Joe.

601
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,251
I don't know.

602
00:37:46,275 --> 00:37:49,745
- You'd be an awful sap to
turn it down at this point, Joe.

603
00:37:49,778 --> 00:37:51,951
Lefty and Eddie?

604
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,551
I mean it would just be
stupid not to do it.

605
00:37:54,583 --> 00:37:56,256
You don't want to be stupid, do you, Joe?

606
00:37:56,285 --> 00:37:58,356
I don't know.

607
00:37:58,387 --> 00:38:01,664
People are going to be awful pissed
if you fuck up their plans, Joe.

608
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:04,637
You don't want to piss everybody off,
do you, Joe. Huh?

609
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:07,163
You don't want me mad at you, do you?

610
00:38:09,164 --> 00:38:11,031
Everybody else is in?

611
00:38:11,219 --> 00:38:13,145
Everybody we need.

612
00:38:15,571 --> 00:38:16,982
Okay.

613
00:38:18,974 --> 00:38:20,954
There's a good boy.

614
00:38:20,976 --> 00:38:23,252
You won't have to look bad.

615
00:38:23,278 --> 00:38:24,814
Just ease off a bit.

616
00:38:24,846 --> 00:38:27,087
That's all we want.

617
00:38:27,115 --> 00:38:28,753
Oh... About the money--

618
00:38:28,784 --> 00:38:32,027
At least 10,000,
on top of your regular series pay.

619
00:38:34,256 --> 00:38:36,723
Chick's workin' on it.

620
00:38:50,038 --> 00:38:51,073
Hey, Bucky.

621
00:38:51,106 --> 00:38:52,915
Welcome to the club.

622
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:56,947
Now, Sport, how about it, hey?

623
00:38:56,979 --> 00:38:58,890
If your fellas come through, Chickie,
you'll see the rest of it.

624
00:38:58,914 --> 00:39:00,689
But, you gotta show something for this.

625
00:39:00,716 --> 00:39:04,425
Now, listen. I told the boys before--
- Hey, Swede. You're lookin' fit, boy.

626
00:39:07,623 --> 00:39:08,966
He come through?

627
00:39:08,991 --> 00:39:11,437
Yeah, everything's well.

628
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,737
Listen now. Burns and Maharg are in
the bar car with this Abe Attell character.

629
00:39:14,763 --> 00:39:16,902
They say they got the jack lined up,
so I'll go in there

630
00:39:16,932 --> 00:39:20,744
and have a couple of pops with 'em
'til I'm through with the boys in there.

631
00:39:20,769 --> 00:39:23,477
Sure. And which way's Bucky?

632
00:39:23,505 --> 00:39:24,745
No problem.

633
00:39:24,773 --> 00:39:27,253
Bucky's one of the boys.

634
00:39:50,132 --> 00:39:51,110
Hughie!

635
00:39:51,133 --> 00:39:52,111
Ring!

636
00:39:52,134 --> 00:39:56,048
Get it all down?
- I go to bet last night at 7 to 3 on the Sox.

637
00:39:56,071 --> 00:39:57,675
Now it's even money.
- You're kidding?

638
00:39:57,706 --> 00:40:01,916
No, I'm not kidding. some very big money
from New York went down on the Reds.

639
00:40:01,943 --> 00:40:03,945
Maybe they know something we don't.

640
00:40:03,979 --> 00:40:05,515
Think Cicotte's arm is sore?

641
00:40:05,547 --> 00:40:08,027
Eddie's had a sore arm for 10 years.

642
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,893
Something's up.

643
00:40:15,557 --> 00:40:16,729
Hey, Bill.

644
00:40:16,758 --> 00:40:20,228
Not a trace of Attell.
- Where is that little rat?

645
00:40:20,262 --> 00:40:21,673
It's all out on bets.

646
00:40:21,697 --> 00:40:24,200
That's not good enough.

647
00:40:24,232 --> 00:40:25,768
Jesus.

648
00:40:25,801 --> 00:40:27,803
You'll get it soon enough.

649
00:40:27,836 --> 00:40:28,837
When?

650
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,008
How much?

651
00:40:30,038 --> 00:40:33,713
100,000, like I said.
20 after each game.

652
00:40:33,742 --> 00:40:36,222
Now, wait a minute.
That's five games.

653
00:40:36,244 --> 00:40:37,655
I thought we were just
going to dump a few.

654
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:39,158
No, you lose the first three.

655
00:40:39,181 --> 00:40:41,286
Kerr is going in the third.
He's not with us.

656
00:40:41,316 --> 00:40:44,661
So what? If we don't hit for him
he'll fold. He's a busher.

657
00:40:44,686 --> 00:40:45,926
After that we'll play it by ear.

658
00:40:45,954 --> 00:40:48,127
We gotta make this look good, see?

659
00:40:49,424 --> 00:40:51,495
I said before the first game, Chick.

660
00:40:51,526 --> 00:40:53,472
Look under your pillow.
- Huh?

661
00:40:53,495 --> 00:40:55,441
Compliments of "Sport" Sullivan.

662
00:40:55,464 --> 00:40:58,343
Whenever Mr. Rothstein fixes something,
it stays fixed.

663
00:41:21,757 --> 00:41:23,600
Getting the jump on us, Bucky?

664
00:41:23,625 --> 00:41:24,831
Hi, Kid.

665
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:27,670
No.
It's just all them reporters at the hotel.

666
00:41:27,696 --> 00:41:29,107
I couldn't think.

667
00:41:30,799 --> 00:41:34,144
I hear some of you fellows
got together on the train last night.

668
00:41:35,203 --> 00:41:36,705
Pep talk, you know.

669
00:41:39,241 --> 00:41:41,721
Something on your mind, Bucky?

670
00:41:41,743 --> 00:41:43,723
You don't look so good.

671
00:41:46,181 --> 00:41:48,252
Kid, what would you--

672
00:41:48,283 --> 00:41:51,264
No, forget it. It's just nerves.
Nerves is all.

673
00:41:54,489 --> 00:41:57,732
Remember all that ground ball patch
when you first come on?

674
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:00,501
Yeah. You made a ball player out of me.

675
00:42:00,529 --> 00:42:02,600
You were a ball player all along.

676
00:42:02,631 --> 00:42:05,134
I just took some of the rough edges off,
that's all.

677
00:42:05,167 --> 00:42:07,508
Do you miss it, Kid? Playing?

678
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:11,112
Every day and every night.

679
00:42:11,139 --> 00:42:13,176
I don't know what I'd do without it.

680
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:17,283
Better go back and get some sleep.

681
00:42:17,312 --> 00:42:19,053
We gotta be sharp for them Reds tomorrow.

682
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,718
Alright.

683
00:42:20,749 --> 00:42:23,593
In the morning.
- Good night, son.

684
00:42:34,031 --> 00:42:37,569
Cicotte, you're a bum!
Go! Go home, Cicotte!

685
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,416
...good seats.

686
00:43:21,443 --> 00:43:23,616
These guys don't look so tough.

687
00:43:23,645 --> 00:43:26,285
Yeah? That's what Custer said
when the Indians took the field.

688
00:43:57,247 --> 00:44:00,349
Smitty... Today's the day!

689
00:44:00,382 --> 00:44:01,520
- It's a fine day.

690
00:44:01,549 --> 00:44:04,257
A beautiful day for it, huh?

691
00:44:04,286 --> 00:44:06,232
- Look, I heard the same thing, fellas.

692
00:44:06,254 --> 00:44:10,498
Every series I've been to there's been some
rumor about a fix just to shake up the odds.

693
00:44:10,525 --> 00:44:12,801
Hang out in bars you
hear a lot of screwy things.

694
00:44:12,827 --> 00:44:14,602
Doesn't mean they're not true.

695
00:44:16,164 --> 00:44:18,166
My guys would've told me
if something was up.

696
00:44:18,199 --> 00:44:20,076
- Sure they would, Kid.

697
00:44:20,101 --> 00:44:21,739
Give 'em a hard day.

698
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,582
Let's keep separate score cards.

699
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:32,114
You circle every play that smells fishy.
I'll do the same.

700
00:44:32,147 --> 00:44:34,593
We'll compare them after the game.

701
00:44:34,616 --> 00:44:36,462
Probably nothing to it.

702
00:44:37,085 --> 00:44:39,995
Yeah, nothing to it.

703
00:44:49,864 --> 00:44:51,343
How's it feeling, Joe?

704
00:44:52,334 --> 00:44:54,075
I don't want to play.

705
00:44:54,102 --> 00:44:55,479
What?!

706
00:44:55,503 --> 00:44:57,176
I don't want to play.

707
00:44:57,205 --> 00:44:59,412
You can tell the boss that, too.

708
00:44:59,441 --> 00:45:01,682
You'll play, Jackson!

709
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:03,451
You'll play!

710
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:14,451
[ Band Playing ]
♫ I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles ♫

711
00:45:20,395 --> 00:45:24,309
- I've been hearing a lot about odds lately,
like this is a race track.

712
00:45:24,332 --> 00:45:26,403
Everybody's a damn handicapper.

713
00:45:26,434 --> 00:45:28,573
Well, sometimes the smart money

714
00:45:28,603 --> 00:45:32,016
gets a little too smart for its own good.

715
00:45:33,008 --> 00:45:34,180
But, I tell you...

716
00:45:34,209 --> 00:45:36,348
I've been in this game over 30 years.

717
00:45:36,378 --> 00:45:39,985
I never yet seen a club
could hold a candle to you fellas.

718
00:45:40,982 --> 00:45:42,557
That's the straight dope.

719
00:45:43,818 --> 00:45:45,798
The way I figure, we can't be beaten.

720
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:48,232
We can only beat ourselves.

721
00:45:50,158 --> 00:45:52,536
You fellas know what I mean.

722
00:45:56,131 --> 00:45:58,236
Alright, let's get 'em!

723
00:46:08,443 --> 00:46:09,945
Excuse me.

724
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:15,493
- Weaver fouled out to Roush.

725
00:46:15,517 --> 00:46:19,431
Sox, no score.
First half inning.

726
00:46:19,454 --> 00:46:22,435
Cincinnati coming to bat.

727
00:46:22,457 --> 00:46:25,267
Would you like a seat, Mr. Rothstein?

728
00:46:25,293 --> 00:46:27,603
I won't be here that long.

729
00:46:34,669 --> 00:46:36,774
Alright, let's play ball!

730
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,511
- Let's go, Eddie!
Let's get 'em now! Let's get 'em!

731
00:46:40,542 --> 00:46:42,021
Here we go, Eddie!

732
00:46:42,043 --> 00:46:43,852
Right in here!
Throw a five, Eddie!

733
00:46:47,182 --> 00:46:48,183
Strike!

734
00:47:01,796 --> 00:47:03,571
Take your base!

735
00:47:13,842 --> 00:47:17,255
Rath, hit by a pitched ball...

736
00:47:17,278 --> 00:47:19,724
advances to first.

737
00:47:28,189 --> 00:47:29,793
- Right in here, Eddie.

738
00:47:29,824 --> 00:47:31,303
Let's do it, Eddie!

739
00:47:31,326 --> 00:47:33,772
C'mon! Right in here, Eddie!

740
00:47:56,284 --> 00:47:57,991
- Okay, Eddie, breeze it here, Eddie!

741
00:47:58,019 --> 00:47:59,555
C'mon, Eddie!

742
00:48:03,992 --> 00:48:05,130
Back, back!

743
00:48:14,035 --> 00:48:15,708
Way to go, Happy.

744
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:24,681
What the hell's he doing?
- No one wants to look bad.

745
00:48:24,712 --> 00:48:27,716
Eddie's going to have to
do it all by himself.

746
00:48:47,168 --> 00:48:48,772
Safe!

747
00:48:48,803 --> 00:48:50,111
- He was off the bag!

748
00:48:50,138 --> 00:48:52,379
C'mon, guys. That coulda been two!

749
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:01,057
One out!

750
00:49:07,822 --> 00:49:09,733
Swede! Swede!

751
00:49:13,328 --> 00:49:15,831
Risberg, you zero, What are you doing?

752
00:49:15,863 --> 00:49:17,103
You woulda had him!

753
00:49:28,509 --> 00:49:30,546
- C'mon, Eddie! Cut him down!

754
00:49:41,489 --> 00:49:43,025
You okay?
- Gimme the ball.

755
00:49:43,069 --> 00:49:44,989
Take it easy.
- Gimme the ball.

756
00:49:46,094 --> 00:49:48,137
Hey, Eddie! Keep it down!

757
00:50:06,547 --> 00:50:08,527
Short! Short!

758
00:50:11,552 --> 00:50:13,828
Eddie, he's the goddamn pitcher!

759
00:50:19,093 --> 00:50:21,505
- The pitcher's finished!

760
00:50:36,544 --> 00:50:39,650
Guess it's not your day, Eddie.

761
00:50:39,681 --> 00:50:41,388
Guess not.

762
00:50:46,621 --> 00:50:50,330
- Gandil grounds out to second base.

763
00:50:50,358 --> 00:50:52,360
Final out.

764
00:50:52,393 --> 00:50:56,535
Redlegs 9, White Sox 1.

765
00:51:09,844 --> 00:51:11,983
So, what's the story, Buck?

766
00:51:15,016 --> 00:51:17,018
What does it look like?

767
00:51:17,051 --> 00:51:19,022
It looked like you skunked out on us.

768
00:51:19,153 --> 00:51:22,896
I haven't taken a nickel.
I don't owe any of you a damn thing.

769
00:51:23,891 --> 00:51:25,199
We let you in on a meeting.

770
00:51:25,226 --> 00:51:29,901
You just play your ball game and I'll
play mine and we'll see how it comes out.

771
00:51:41,509 --> 00:51:43,321
Come on in.

772
00:51:43,945 --> 00:51:45,133
Ring.

773
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:46,451
Hiya, Eddie.

774
00:51:46,481 --> 00:51:47,926
Have a seat.

775
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:51,157
I thought Cincy was a dry town.

776
00:51:51,386 --> 00:51:53,366
Laws were made to be broken.

777
00:51:54,355 --> 00:51:55,632
Catch.

778
00:51:57,558 --> 00:51:58,662
- What's this?

779
00:51:58,693 --> 00:52:01,299
The new ball they're
thinking of using next year.

780
00:52:01,329 --> 00:52:03,240
It's wound tighter.

781
00:52:04,232 --> 00:52:06,269
This thing will take off like a rabbit.

782
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:09,076
- The word is they'll
outlaw the spitter next year.

783
00:52:09,103 --> 00:52:10,582
And, your shine ball.

784
00:52:10,605 --> 00:52:12,608
Things will be tough for pitchers.

785
00:52:12,807 --> 00:52:15,187
Things are always tough for pitchers.

786
00:52:17,645 --> 00:52:19,852
You really took a shelling out there today.

787
00:52:19,881 --> 00:52:21,519
Ah, they got their raps in.

788
00:52:21,549 --> 00:52:25,258
That one Reuther caught hold of
looked like you tossed it in underhand.

789
00:52:25,286 --> 00:52:26,822
It didn't break.

790
00:52:26,854 --> 00:52:28,993
You didn't put anything on it.

791
00:52:29,023 --> 00:52:30,630
Why should it break?

792
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,836
You bring me up here
to tell me I had a lousy day?

793
00:52:38,466 --> 00:52:41,470
I wanna know if the series
is on the level, Eddie.

794
00:52:44,238 --> 00:52:46,475
What if I told you
we're doing our best?

795
00:52:46,708 --> 00:52:48,847
I'll believe you.

796
00:52:51,179 --> 00:52:54,023
We played like a bunch of bushers today.

797
00:52:54,048 --> 00:52:55,925
But nobody's in the bag.

798
00:52:58,486 --> 00:53:00,704
Don't be sore at me for asking, okay?

799
00:53:00,855 --> 00:53:04,359
Nah. We're just dumb ball players.

800
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:08,871
We need a mug like you to keep us honest.

801
00:53:12,066 --> 00:53:13,773
Yeah.

802
00:53:13,801 --> 00:53:14,973
- It's me, Joe.

803
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:24,721
I got something for you, Joe.

804
00:53:24,745 --> 00:53:26,588
On the dresser.

805
00:53:31,419 --> 00:53:33,456
Swede said he'd appreciate it

806
00:53:33,488 --> 00:53:36,935
if you'd ease up a little on the field.

807
00:53:36,958 --> 00:53:40,239
You looked awful good out there today.

808
00:53:48,603 --> 00:53:50,344
- Hey, c'mon, Lefty, let's groove one!

809
00:53:50,371 --> 00:53:52,282
Let's get this guy!

810
00:53:54,942 --> 00:53:56,285
Ball!

811
00:53:57,778 --> 00:54:00,486
Just stick 'em on for the glove, will ya?

812
00:54:06,287 --> 00:54:08,233
- C'mon, Dale!

813
00:54:11,425 --> 00:54:13,530
- C'mon, Claude, let's go!

814
00:54:13,561 --> 00:54:15,097
Get it in here!

815
00:54:24,605 --> 00:54:26,209
Safe!

816
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,241
Time!

817
00:54:28,576 --> 00:54:30,749
I called for a curve ball.
- That's what I threw.

818
00:54:30,778 --> 00:54:33,622
Looked pretty straight to me.

819
00:54:33,648 --> 00:54:34,786
Two outs!

820
00:54:34,815 --> 00:54:36,590
Let's go!

821
00:54:59,006 --> 00:55:00,110
I got it.

822
00:55:04,145 --> 00:55:06,455
Safe!
- Curve ball, damn it!

823
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:11,130
- You White Sox stink!

824
00:55:11,152 --> 00:55:12,756
- Williams! You stink!

825
00:55:12,787 --> 00:55:14,630
- Okay, let's go, Lefty! C'mon!

826
00:55:14,655 --> 00:55:17,158
Bring it in here!
Let's go, let's go!

827
00:55:17,191 --> 00:55:20,468
Okay, Lefty! Hump it!

828
00:55:24,065 --> 00:55:25,043
Out!

829
00:55:25,066 --> 00:55:26,511
Alright, Bucky!

830
00:55:26,534 --> 00:55:30,107
You guys see that? Way to go, Buck!

831
00:55:32,173 --> 00:55:33,243
Nice grab.

832
00:55:33,274 --> 00:55:34,651
Yeah.

833
00:55:42,017 --> 00:55:45,124
- If you can't hit good, go back to Chicago!
- Go back!

834
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:48,257
- You got shit for brains, Schalk!

835
00:55:55,496 --> 00:55:57,840
Hold it! Hold it!

836
00:55:57,865 --> 00:55:58,866
Go! Go!

837
00:56:00,001 --> 00:56:01,605
Safe!

838
00:56:03,371 --> 00:56:05,317
Alright, fellas! C'mon! C'mon!

839
00:56:39,974 --> 00:56:42,454
Ask it if it can pitch.

840
00:57:01,762 --> 00:57:04,208
Williams, you son of a bitch!

841
00:57:04,231 --> 00:57:06,711
- What's the matter with you guys?

842
00:57:06,734 --> 00:57:09,408
Son of a bitch!

843
00:57:09,437 --> 00:57:12,850
He blocked me up all day out there
with those goddamn curve balls!

844
00:57:12,873 --> 00:57:14,216
What's this, Williams?

845
00:57:14,241 --> 00:57:17,552
What's that?!
- How about it, Lefty?

846
00:57:19,715 --> 00:57:22,388
- There he is! Hey, Kid!
- How about a few quotables, Kid?

847
00:57:22,416 --> 00:57:23,588
I got nothing to say!

848
00:57:23,617 --> 00:57:25,290
Hey, c'mon. Don't be a sore loser.

849
00:57:25,319 --> 00:57:26,457
I got nothin' to say!

850
00:57:26,487 --> 00:57:28,228
Now, get off my back, all of you!

851
00:57:30,391 --> 00:57:31,995
What's the scoop, Buck?

852
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:35,362
Print what you want, Smitty.

853
00:57:45,539 --> 00:57:47,382
Have a good game, Gandil?

854
00:57:48,375 --> 00:57:50,787
Not bad. Did you?

855
00:57:53,114 --> 00:57:56,323
I know what you're doing,
you son of a bitch!

856
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:58,694
I know what you're doing!

857
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:00,756
So help me...!

858
00:58:00,788 --> 00:58:02,267
Gandil! Gandil!

859
00:58:02,289 --> 00:58:05,068
C'mon, boys! C'mon, let's go!

860
00:58:05,693 --> 00:58:07,764
- Hey, Gleason! Comiskey!

861
00:58:07,795 --> 00:58:12,244
We got one of your stiffs down here!

862
00:58:34,889 --> 00:58:36,732
Mr. Comiskey?

863
00:58:36,757 --> 00:58:38,862
- Who is it?
Gleason!

864
00:58:44,298 --> 00:58:46,471
I gotta talk to you.

865
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,480
It better be important.

866
00:59:04,652 --> 00:59:07,155
If I'm being robbed of my world series

867
00:59:07,188 --> 00:59:10,465
he damn well better
do something about it!

868
00:59:33,548 --> 00:59:35,349
- What do you two birds want?

869
00:59:35,382 --> 00:59:36,986
We need the rest of the player's cut.

870
00:59:37,017 --> 00:59:38,553
It's all out on bets.

871
00:59:39,453 --> 00:59:41,660
What's this?
- You heard me.

872
00:59:42,790 --> 00:59:46,704
I made an agreement with those guys.
- Well, that's your problem, ain't it?

873
00:59:46,727 --> 00:59:48,798
You little prick!

874
00:59:51,932 --> 00:59:56,108
Hey. A couple of boy scouts here,
they made a deal.

875
00:59:56,136 --> 00:59:58,412
The players are in now, get it?

876
00:59:58,439 --> 01:00:00,248
We got 'em by the short ones.

877
01:00:00,274 --> 01:00:02,379
What are they going to do?
Call a cop?

878
01:00:03,377 --> 01:00:07,723
Here... 10,000.

879
01:00:08,849 --> 01:00:11,056
But, that's all of it.
That's the end.

880
01:00:13,387 --> 01:00:16,027
Here. You give it to them.
- No, Burnsy, not me.

881
01:00:18,025 --> 01:00:19,732
C'mon, Billy.

882
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,263
It stinks in here.

883
01:00:22,296 --> 01:00:24,833
And, tell them bums to
make it look good tomorrow.

884
01:00:31,472 --> 01:00:33,110
It's 2:00 in the morning.

885
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:36,280
He's president of the league.
He has to do something.

886
01:00:36,310 --> 01:00:39,189
He isn't even talking to you, Commy.

887
01:00:39,213 --> 01:00:41,159
He's got to talk to me.

888
01:00:49,223 --> 01:00:50,600
- What do you want?

889
01:00:50,624 --> 01:00:52,331
Now, I just talked to Gleason.

890
01:00:52,359 --> 01:00:54,566
He thinks Williams threw the game.

891
01:00:54,595 --> 01:00:57,576
- All I saw was that your boys
didn't have a shot--

892
01:00:57,598 --> 01:00:59,077
Sure thing, Sport.

893
01:00:59,099 --> 01:01:01,579
- They lost it fair and square.

894
01:01:01,602 --> 01:01:03,081
I'm being robbed

895
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:06,050
and you're going
to do something about it!

896
01:01:11,011 --> 01:01:14,049
That's the welcome of baiting currs!

897
01:01:15,349 --> 01:01:16,623
Commy!

898
01:01:22,957 --> 01:01:24,300
How you doin', Kid?

899
01:01:41,709 --> 01:01:42,881
Did you get it down?

900
01:01:42,910 --> 01:01:45,447
Every penny.
6 to 5 for the Reds is all.

901
01:01:45,479 --> 01:01:48,983
Even though the Chicago bunch
think Dickie Kerr will win.

902
01:01:53,387 --> 01:01:55,230
How's it feel, Dickie?

903
01:01:55,255 --> 01:01:57,257
My arms great.

904
01:01:57,291 --> 01:01:58,895
It's my knees.

905
01:01:58,926 --> 01:02:00,496
Just another ball game.

906
01:02:00,527 --> 01:02:01,597
Sure.

907
01:02:03,330 --> 01:02:06,106
Pitch 'em one at a time, son.

908
01:02:06,133 --> 01:02:08,477
I remember the time I threw
a clean slate at the Cleveland club.

909
01:02:08,502 --> 01:02:11,005
You beat Cy Young one to nothing.

910
01:02:11,038 --> 01:02:13,484
Hughie Jennings hit a homer in the ninth.
- Huh?

911
01:02:13,507 --> 01:02:16,784
My grandfather took me.

912
01:02:16,810 --> 01:02:19,552
First big league game I ever went to.

913
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:22,083
Kid Gleason beat the Indians
with a no-hitter.

914
01:02:22,116 --> 01:02:23,424
No kiddin'?!

915
01:02:26,153 --> 01:02:28,326
You're havin' a hell of a series, Buck.

916
01:02:30,057 --> 01:02:31,866
What's that supposed to mean?

917
01:02:31,892 --> 01:02:35,203
Nothin'. Just keep it up is all.

918
01:02:35,229 --> 01:02:37,869
Why wouldn't I?

919
01:02:37,898 --> 01:02:40,469
You'd know the answer to that
better than I would, Buck.

920
01:02:45,706 --> 01:02:47,344
- Take your base.

921
01:03:17,938 --> 01:03:19,339
Run, damn it!

922
01:03:20,607 --> 01:03:21,915
You're out!

923
01:03:21,942 --> 01:03:23,853
What the hell was that?

924
01:03:23,877 --> 01:03:27,415
I could have beaten that throwout
with my shoes tied together!

925
01:03:27,448 --> 01:03:29,558
- Never get work as an actor.

926
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:37,090
- Okay, Dickie, this is it, Dickie.
You got 'em!

927
01:03:37,124 --> 01:03:39,104
Here we go! Here we go, Dickie!

928
01:03:39,126 --> 01:03:40,503
Let's do it!

929
01:03:40,527 --> 01:03:43,906
Here we go, Dickie, here we go!

930
01:03:49,069 --> 01:03:51,049
- Swing!
- Swing!

931
01:03:51,071 --> 01:03:52,550
You're out!

932
01:03:57,344 --> 01:04:00,154
Beautiful, Dickie, that's the way!

933
01:04:02,916 --> 01:04:04,259
Come on, Dickie!

934
01:04:29,676 --> 01:04:31,314
Slide! You've got it!

935
01:04:31,345 --> 01:04:32,790
Safe!

936
01:04:35,048 --> 01:04:36,026
Swing!

937
01:04:36,049 --> 01:04:37,528
Swing!

938
01:04:37,551 --> 01:04:40,327
You're out! Three strikes!

939
01:04:43,056 --> 01:04:44,160
Out!

940
01:04:44,191 --> 01:04:46,637
Great throw, buddy!

941
01:04:58,472 --> 01:05:03,012
That's the winner! Alright, Dickie!

942
01:05:07,614 --> 01:05:10,652
Bill?
- Yeah?

943
01:05:10,684 --> 01:05:14,063
Think you can stake me
the train fare back to Philly?

944
01:05:16,256 --> 01:05:19,169
Hey, Joey, I hate to bother you but, it's
about that 20,000 you still owe Mr. Rothstein.

945
01:05:19,193 --> 01:05:21,366
You gonna come up with it?
What?

946
01:05:22,963 --> 01:05:25,671
Well, if it's all clear between you two,
I'm delighted to hear it.

947
01:05:25,699 --> 01:05:29,613
Listen, Joey. Since you're sitting pretty
over there I could use 2,000 over here--

948
01:05:31,238 --> 01:05:32,945
What do you mean it's all out on bets?

949
01:05:32,973 --> 01:05:35,544
Kerr had the day of his life...

950
01:05:35,576 --> 01:05:39,456
but, if it wasn't 5 out of 9 this year,
they'd be cooked.

951
01:05:39,479 --> 01:05:41,982
We'll have to see what
Eddie Cicotte shows them tomorrow.

952
01:05:42,015 --> 01:05:44,427
Yeah, Eddie is the ticket.

953
01:05:49,590 --> 01:05:52,594
Ah, so that's where you went.

954
01:05:52,626 --> 01:05:54,867
Keep you up last night?

955
01:05:54,895 --> 01:05:56,897
Don't make any difference.

956
01:05:56,930 --> 01:05:58,807
You're the one needs the sleep.

957
01:06:00,601 --> 01:06:02,638
You shouldn't worry so much.

958
01:06:02,669 --> 01:06:04,842
You're gonna wallop 'em today.

959
01:06:04,871 --> 01:06:06,077
You got the home field.

960
01:06:06,106 --> 01:06:08,586
The whole city's there backing you up.

961
01:06:11,778 --> 01:06:14,859
If I tell you something,
you swear you'll never tell a soul?

962
01:06:16,083 --> 01:06:17,084
What is it?

963
01:06:19,286 --> 01:06:21,857
Some of the guys
ain't playing on the level.

964
01:06:21,888 --> 01:06:23,595
Nah?!

965
01:06:23,624 --> 01:06:27,470
Chick, Swede, Lefty, Eddie Cicotte and
some of the others. It's hard for me to tell.

966
01:06:27,494 --> 01:06:30,373
Eddie?
- Eddie.

967
01:06:30,397 --> 01:06:31,774
They wanted me in on it, too.

968
01:06:31,798 --> 01:06:33,971
What'd you tell 'em?

969
01:06:34,001 --> 01:06:35,605
I told them to take a hike!

970
01:06:37,771 --> 01:06:42,344
Now, I go out there on the field, you know.
I make the plays. I don't feel right.

971
01:06:42,976 --> 01:06:45,115
Isn't there somebody you can tell?

972
01:06:45,145 --> 01:06:48,486
Kid knows. He's got to.

973
01:06:48,515 --> 01:06:50,089
Sometimes I figure he's like me.

974
01:06:50,117 --> 01:06:53,690
He's waiting for the boys to
straighten up in time to take the series.

975
01:06:56,290 --> 01:06:58,566
The dugout is like--

976
01:07:01,695 --> 01:07:03,971
Nobody can look each other in the eye.

977
01:07:05,399 --> 01:07:09,404
Go out on the field and you
don't know who's trying and who's not.

978
01:07:17,778 --> 01:07:21,225
I wish I didn't know.

979
01:07:21,248 --> 01:07:24,354
Yeah, me either.

980
01:07:24,384 --> 01:07:26,386
- Okay, Eddie!

981
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:28,422
Let's get 'em!

982
01:07:28,455 --> 01:07:30,264
Right in there! Throw a five, Eddie!

983
01:07:41,868 --> 01:07:44,542
Eddie! Eddie!

984
01:07:44,571 --> 01:07:46,448
Cicotte! What was that?

985
01:07:46,473 --> 01:07:48,282
You look like a busher.

986
01:07:52,546 --> 01:07:55,745
- C'mon, Knuckles, keep it down!

987
01:07:55,782 --> 01:07:57,557
C'mon, Eddie! Let's go!
Let's get it in here!

988
01:08:01,888 --> 01:08:04,266
Joe, four!

989
01:08:04,291 --> 01:08:05,736
Joe, four!

990
01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:08,869
Let it go! Let it go!

991
01:08:08,895 --> 01:08:12,308
Eddie, what are you doing?!

992
01:08:12,332 --> 01:08:15,040
How do you make a play like that?

993
01:08:15,068 --> 01:08:17,373
- What did you grab it off for, Eddie?

994
01:08:22,776 --> 01:08:25,017
You lied to me, Eddie.

995
01:08:29,182 --> 01:08:30,559
- Don't worry, Commy.

996
01:08:30,584 --> 01:08:33,030
Your boys will be right tomorrow.

997
01:08:38,325 --> 01:08:40,965
- Okay! Okay!
Let's get 'em!

998
01:08:54,574 --> 01:08:55,575
Safe.

999
01:08:59,246 --> 01:09:01,292
Now it's Felsch.

1000
01:09:11,691 --> 01:09:13,329
Get it down, Happer!

1001
01:09:16,763 --> 01:09:19,175
- Go! Run! Run!

1002
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,107
Safe.

1003
01:09:22,135 --> 01:09:26,550
Safe? You goddamn fiddlesticks, I had him!
Who's paying you?

1004
01:09:26,573 --> 01:09:27,677
Take a walk, Ray.

1005
01:09:27,707 --> 01:09:31,177
That's the worst call I've ever seen, Draper,
and that I've seen for seven years!

1006
01:09:31,211 --> 01:09:34,158
You heard me, Ray--
Out of the ball game!

1007
01:09:35,148 --> 01:09:37,287
It's all yours, Kid!

1008
01:09:45,392 --> 01:09:47,429
C'mon, let's go!

1009
01:09:47,461 --> 01:09:49,168
It's all yours!

1010
01:09:51,097 --> 01:09:52,303
Throw it!

1011
01:09:52,332 --> 01:09:53,310
Hey, Buck.

1012
01:09:53,333 --> 01:09:55,574
Hi, fellas.

1013
01:09:55,602 --> 01:09:58,879
Hey, guys! Look, it's Buck Weaver.

1014
01:09:58,905 --> 01:10:00,316
Tough breaks today.

1015
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:02,843
Yeah, I couldn't get the wood on the ball.
- No kiddin'.

1016
01:10:02,876 --> 01:10:05,254
My old man says you guys just gave up.

1017
01:10:05,278 --> 01:10:07,622
He says the Sox just
laid down for the Reds.

1018
01:10:07,647 --> 01:10:09,684
Your old man don't know beans!
- Says who?

1019
01:10:11,918 --> 01:10:14,023
Hey! Hey, ease up!

1020
01:10:15,355 --> 01:10:16,891
Thanks for sticking up for us.

1021
01:10:16,923 --> 01:10:18,664
A guy's gotta stick up for his friends.

1022
01:10:18,692 --> 01:10:20,433
- Even when they play
like a bunch of stiffs?

1023
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:22,235
Yeah, especially then.

1024
01:10:23,363 --> 01:10:26,003
A guy who don't stick up for his friends...

1025
01:10:26,032 --> 01:10:28,205
there ain't much to say for him.

1026
01:10:29,669 --> 01:10:31,444
Right, Buck?

1027
01:10:53,093 --> 01:10:58,736
♫ I'm forever blowing ball games

1028
01:10:58,765 --> 01:11:02,577
♫ Pretty ball games in the air

1029
01:11:02,602 --> 01:11:05,310
♫ I come from Chi

1030
01:11:05,338 --> 01:11:07,545
♫ I hardly try

1031
01:11:07,574 --> 01:11:12,455
♫ Just go to bat,
and fade and die

1032
01:11:12,479 --> 01:11:15,722
♫ Fortune's coming my way

1033
01:11:15,749 --> 01:11:19,162
♫ That's why I don't care

1034
01:11:19,185 --> 01:11:23,600
♫ I'm forever blowing ball games

1035
01:11:23,623 --> 01:11:29,073
♫ And the gamblers
treat us fair ♫♫

1036
01:11:34,534 --> 01:11:36,575
A crackpot.

1037
01:11:36,970 --> 01:11:39,280

1038
01:11:39,306 --> 01:11:42,776

1039
01:11:42,809 --> 01:11:45,881

1040
01:11:54,387 --> 01:11:58,028
Yes! Way to go, Joey!

1041
01:12:02,329 --> 01:12:04,206
Quiet! Quiet!

1042
01:12:04,230 --> 01:12:06,574
Kerr must have got out Knight or something.

1043
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,671
They say it's tied
going into the eigth inning.

1044
01:12:08,702 --> 01:12:10,147
Wait a minute!

1045
01:12:12,939 --> 01:12:15,078
- Here we go, Chick!

1046
01:12:18,812 --> 01:12:20,485
Let's go! C'mon!

1047
01:12:21,781 --> 01:12:24,125
Play ball!

1048
01:12:24,150 --> 01:12:27,654
C'mon, Chickie baby!
We gotta do something here now, Chick.

1049
01:12:27,687 --> 01:12:30,031
C'mon, Chick!

1050
01:12:30,056 --> 01:12:33,060
C'mon, Chick, show me something.

1051
01:12:59,819 --> 01:13:02,429
Oh, shit.

1052
01:13:31,718 --> 01:13:33,664
It's open.

1053
01:13:35,955 --> 01:13:37,901
Hey, Eddie.

1054
01:13:45,231 --> 01:13:46,608
How's it goin'?

1055
01:13:46,633 --> 01:13:47,771
Okay.

1056
01:13:47,801 --> 01:13:51,248
Still now word from Chick about the money.

1057
01:13:51,271 --> 01:13:53,615
I don't care about the money.

1058
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:54,914
- Yeah.

1059
01:13:54,941 --> 01:13:58,184
Peculiar way to find that out, isn't it?

1060
01:14:05,618 --> 01:14:08,224
What are you going to
do out there tomorrow, Eddie?

1061
01:14:09,589 --> 01:14:11,694
I don't know yet.

1062
01:14:15,095 --> 01:14:17,051
I thought you were supposed to
be in charge of this thing.

1062
01:14:17,095 --> 01:14:18,474
What happened to Sullivan?

1063
01:14:18,498 --> 01:14:21,104
He switched hotels.
We can't seem to track him down.

1064
01:14:21,134 --> 01:14:22,613
- And what happened to Attell?

1065
01:14:22,635 --> 01:14:24,672
He says he shot his wad
in the third game when Kerr won.

1066
01:14:24,704 --> 01:14:26,274
He says he's busted.

1067
01:14:26,306 --> 01:14:27,785
Well, the hell with them then.

1068
01:14:27,807 --> 01:14:29,286
You two made an agreement.

1069
01:14:29,309 --> 01:14:30,982
Hey, we lose one more game and it's over.

1070
01:14:31,010 --> 01:14:33,616
We dumped four games,
I've only been paid for one.

1071
01:14:33,646 --> 01:14:34,716
You don't know what these guys are like.

1072
01:14:35,715 --> 01:14:39,288
Once you're in, you're in for good.
You can't welch on these guys!

1073
01:14:41,821 --> 01:14:44,529
It's your funeral, assholes.

1074
01:14:44,557 --> 01:14:45,831
Problems?

1075
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:50,264
No. We still got Eddie.

1076
01:15:04,844 --> 01:15:07,120
Put it away, Eddie.
I'm going with Wilkinson today.

1077
01:15:10,083 --> 01:15:11,460
Why?

1078
01:15:11,484 --> 01:15:13,896
You haven't had the stuff lately,
have you.

1079
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:15,797
But I feel alright today.

1080
01:15:15,822 --> 01:15:17,859
I can't take any chances. I'm sorry.

1081
01:15:17,891 --> 01:15:19,871
I say I can't lose.
That's how right i feel.

1082
01:15:19,893 --> 01:15:21,668
Sure you do, Eddie.

1083
01:15:21,694 --> 01:15:23,173
- Kid?

1084
01:15:23,196 --> 01:15:25,472
I can't miss.

1085
01:15:28,601 --> 01:15:30,274
Watch him.

1086
01:15:35,775 --> 01:15:38,051
Your move, Eddie.

1087
01:15:45,185 --> 01:15:46,391
- Give it a change up.

1088
01:15:47,387 --> 01:15:49,333
- What a waste! You stink up the lawn!

1089
01:15:50,855 --> 01:15:52,712
- Go back home, Eddie!

1090
01:16:09,642 --> 01:16:12,452
How long do you think he'll go
before he dumps it?

1091
01:16:12,478 --> 01:16:13,786
Play ball!

1092
01:16:17,584 --> 01:16:19,621
Okay, Eddie baby, this is it!

1093
01:16:19,652 --> 01:16:21,325
It's up to you, Eddie baby.

1094
01:16:21,354 --> 01:16:23,664
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's get this guy, Eddie!

1095
01:16:26,392 --> 01:16:27,837
Strike!

1096
01:16:29,062 --> 01:16:30,837
Forget it, Morey.

1097
01:16:33,666 --> 01:16:34,838
Strike!

1098
01:16:37,470 --> 01:16:39,450
Strike three! You're outa there!

1099
01:16:47,247 --> 01:16:48,749
You're out!

1100
01:16:48,781 --> 01:16:50,158
You're out!

1101
01:16:50,183 --> 01:16:52,390
One more!

1102
01:17:00,026 --> 01:17:02,563
Okay, Hap! That's the way!

1103
01:17:03,763 --> 01:17:05,003
Strike!

1104
01:17:05,031 --> 01:17:06,840
Strike!

1105
01:17:08,034 --> 01:17:09,672
Strike!

1106
01:17:09,702 --> 01:17:11,875
Two more men, eh?!

1107
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:17,014
Yeah, let's go! That was a beauty!

1108
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:40,441
C'mon, Eddie! Bring it on in there!
You got the power! You got the fire!

1109
01:17:40,466 --> 01:17:41,843
Give 'em another one!

1110
01:17:41,868 --> 01:17:44,439
C'mon, Eddie! One more batter!

1111
01:17:44,470 --> 01:17:46,973
Throw 'em a shine ball,
then blow it right by 'em.

1112
01:17:47,006 --> 01:17:49,282
Okay, Eddie baby, this is it!

1113
01:17:49,309 --> 01:17:51,516
It's up to you, Eddie!
Let's get this guy!

1114
01:17:51,544 --> 01:17:53,455
You got the fire!

1115
01:17:56,349 --> 01:17:57,453
Strike two!

1116
01:17:57,483 --> 01:17:59,656
Did you see that pitch?!

1117
01:17:59,686 --> 01:18:02,132
Okay, Eddie! One more, Eddie!

1118
01:18:02,155 --> 01:18:04,533
Let's get 'em!

1119
01:18:04,557 --> 01:18:07,800
Let's get 'em now, Eddie!

1120
01:18:07,827 --> 01:18:10,831
You got 'em! Bring it in here, Eddie!

1121
01:18:10,863 --> 01:18:11,933
Here we go, Eddie!!

1122
01:18:14,567 --> 01:18:15,807
You're out!

1123
01:18:15,835 --> 01:18:19,942
Alright, Eddie! Yes!

1124
01:18:19,973 --> 01:18:21,919
That's beautiful, Eddie!

1125
01:18:32,185 --> 01:18:35,462
And I figured I ought to
save my blue-chip ball players.

1126
01:18:35,488 --> 01:18:37,559
If you've got faith in your fellas
they'll come around.

1127
01:18:37,590 --> 01:18:41,936
The Reds only need one more game to take
the series. That's do or die for your club.

1128
01:18:41,961 --> 01:18:45,101
No sweat.
- What makes you so confident, Kid?

1129
01:18:45,131 --> 01:18:46,769
I think the boys
are back on their form.

1130
01:18:46,799 --> 01:18:48,801
They've got the look of Moran's staff now.

1131
01:18:48,835 --> 01:18:51,042
And they'll be swinging free
from this point on.

1132
01:18:51,070 --> 01:18:53,880
I tell you, trust always
comes through in the clinchers.

1133
01:18:53,906 --> 01:18:57,581
Eddie came to me this morning and he said,
"Kid, I can't miss".

1134
01:18:57,610 --> 01:19:01,490
We got Lefty Williams pitching tomorrow.
One of the finest pitchers I ever seen.

1135
01:19:01,514 --> 01:19:03,084
Super big game, Lefty.

1136
01:19:03,116 --> 01:19:06,563
How do you explain the way your boys
laid down in the other games?

1137
01:19:06,586 --> 01:19:08,088
What do you mean, 'laid down'?

1138
01:19:08,121 --> 01:19:11,762
Well, they didn't seem
too enthusiastic about their jobs

1139
01:19:11,791 --> 01:19:13,998
- Nobody did any laying down.

1140
01:19:14,027 --> 01:19:17,031
Might have been a little overconfident...
Maybe we didn't have the fine edge...

1141
01:19:17,063 --> 01:19:18,701
but the boys have been putting out.

1142
01:19:18,731 --> 01:19:22,508
- The boys been put out
more than they've been putting out.

1143
01:19:22,535 --> 01:19:25,948
- You really think you can
turn this series around, Kid?

1144
01:19:25,972 --> 01:19:26,973
No sweat!

1145
01:19:27,006 --> 01:19:29,179
- The odds are pretty steep.

1146
01:19:29,208 --> 01:19:31,119
My boys don't care about the odds!

1147
01:19:31,144 --> 01:19:35,320
Anything can happen in this game.
Anything!

1148
01:19:35,448 --> 01:19:37,758
So, you figure the boys
will be hitting tomorrow?

1149
01:19:37,784 --> 01:19:39,320
I sure hope so.

1150
01:19:39,352 --> 01:19:41,525
You gotta pitch
better than your last time out.

1151
01:19:41,554 --> 01:19:43,227
I suspect I will.

1152
01:19:43,256 --> 01:19:44,792
Thank you very much.

1153
01:19:44,824 --> 01:19:46,462
You're welcome.

1154
01:19:47,894 --> 01:19:48,998
Hello, friend.

1155
01:19:49,028 --> 01:19:50,268
You want me to sign this, too?

1156
01:19:50,296 --> 01:19:51,775
You're going to lose tomorrow.

1157
01:19:51,798 --> 01:19:54,404
Oh, is that so.
- I know it for a fact.

1158
01:19:54,434 --> 01:19:56,436
Is that your wife?

1159
01:19:57,770 --> 01:19:59,408
Yeah, what's it to you?

1160
01:19:59,439 --> 01:20:01,749
You're going to lose tomorrow
or she dies.

1161
01:20:09,148 --> 01:20:12,152
Who sent you?
- You made a promise to certain people.

1162
01:20:12,185 --> 01:20:14,631
You son of a bitch!
- You can't protect her.

1163
01:20:14,654 --> 01:20:16,998
If I don't do it, somebody else will.

1164
01:20:18,825 --> 01:20:20,702
First inning, Mr. Williams.

1165
01:20:26,732 --> 01:20:28,769
What did he want, honey?

1166
01:20:28,801 --> 01:20:32,408
Oh, nothin'.
He just give me some advice

1167
01:20:32,438 --> 01:20:34,315
on how to pitch the game tomorrow.

1168
01:20:34,340 --> 01:20:36,581
Everybody's an expert.

♫ Through the perilous fight

Excuse me, sir.

1185
01:22:08,434 --> 01:22:11,074
I would like to bet you
that my husband, Lefty Williams,

1186
01:22:11,103 --> 01:22:13,242
will pitch a no-hitter game.

1187
01:22:13,272 --> 01:22:15,616
Ma'am, in my opinion,
it won't go past the very first inning.

1188
01:22:15,641 --> 01:22:18,053
I will bet you $5.00.

1189

1190
01:22:50,209 --> 01:22:54,453
Okay, Lefty, bring it in!
Bring it in!

1191

- Take a shower, Williams!

1192
01:23:00,953 --> 01:23:03,297
Bear down, Lefty! You can do it!

1193
01:23:08,361 --> 01:23:09,772
Ball.

1194
01:23:09,795 --> 01:23:11,797
- Put the ball over the plate!

1195
01:23:13,766 --> 01:23:16,144
James, get your arm ready!

1196
01:23:23,477 --> 01:23:26,156
Shit!
What the hell are you throwing?

1197
01:23:55,741 --> 01:23:58,051
Nothin' but fast balls.

1198
01:23:58,077 --> 01:24:00,250
Slow ones.

1199
01:24:00,279 --> 01:24:02,281
James, your in.

1200
01:24:10,756 --> 01:24:13,794
Didn't take you long, did it, Lefty?

1201
01:24:18,597 --> 01:24:20,804
Told you it wouldn't go past the first.

1202
01:24:20,833 --> 01:24:22,278
Got a tip on it.

1203

Thank you.

1204
01:24:39,285 --> 01:24:42,095
- Cincinnati scores again.

1205
01:24:42,121 --> 01:24:45,068
Score is four to nothing.

1206
01:24:45,091 --> 01:24:48,732
Tough inning, huh?
- Yes, but they'll come through.

1207

Yup.

You had a damn fine series, Bucky.

1215
01:26:10,075 --> 01:26:11,520
We lost.

1216
01:26:13,345 --> 01:26:16,451
We didn't get the breaks.

1217
01:26:16,482 --> 01:26:18,860

Our job is to control that investigation.

unless you and your fellow owners
make the public think

1270
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:43,791
that you are absolutely
clean in this matter.

1271
01:29:43,822 --> 01:29:45,631
How do we manage that?

1272
01:29:46,792 --> 01:29:49,363
- We felt that with
your record of service

1273
01:29:49,395 --> 01:29:51,705
and with the high esteem
the public holds for you--

1274
01:29:51,730 --> 01:29:53,710
We need a commission--

1275
01:29:53,732 --> 01:29:56,372
Someone outside of baseball...

1276
01:29:56,402 --> 01:29:58,905
who'd have certain powers to--

1277
01:29:58,937 --> 01:30:01,383
Absolute power.

1278
01:30:01,407 --> 01:30:05,480
Absolute powers?
- It won't work any other way.

1279
01:30:05,511 --> 01:30:07,684
People won't believe it.

1280
01:30:07,713 --> 01:30:09,693
Absolute power.

1281
01:30:09,715 --> 01:30:11,695
Well, anyhow, we felt that the man

1282
01:30:11,717 --> 01:30:13,993
that cleaned the Reds
out of the country during the war

1283
01:30:14,019 --> 01:30:17,694
was the right man to clean up baseball.

1284
01:30:17,723 --> 01:30:19,566
We are prepared to offer you
a two year contract--

1285
01:30:19,591 --> 01:30:21,127
- Lifetime contract.

1286
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:22,571
Lifetime?

1287
01:30:22,594 --> 01:30:25,837
A man worried about his job

1288
01:30:25,864 --> 01:30:28,174
is bound to play favorites.

1289
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:30,146
You gentlemen don't want that, do you?

1290
01:30:30,169 --> 01:30:32,843
But, a lifetime contract seems--

1291
01:30:36,508 --> 01:30:40,718
I'm back in court
in five minutes, gentlemen.

1292
01:30:40,746 --> 01:30:43,459
Let's talk salary.

1293
01:30:43,682 --> 01:30:46,128
A man, who in the dark days

1294
01:30:46,151 --> 01:30:48,392
of the last great conflict

1295
01:30:48,420 --> 01:30:50,900
made use of his official trust

1296
01:30:50,923 --> 01:30:54,996
to fight the Hun on these very shores.

1297
01:30:55,027 --> 01:30:59,134
A patriot of the first order.
A family man...

1298
01:30:59,164 --> 01:31:03,078
Landis used to lead the league
in reversed decisions.

1299
01:31:03,102 --> 01:31:05,708
He says he's gonna clean up baseball.

1300
01:31:05,738 --> 01:31:08,810
He can start with the birds
up on the stairs with him.

1301
01:31:08,841 --> 01:31:12,880
...over our all American pastime
of baseball.

1302
01:31:14,279 --> 01:31:16,816
It gives me great honor

1303
01:31:16,849 --> 01:31:24,233
to introduce Judge Kenesaw Mulkin Landis.

1304
01:31:28,060 --> 01:31:30,939
Read all about it! Baseball corrupt!
Read it here!

1305
01:31:30,963 --> 01:31:33,637
Grand jury called!
Read all about it!

1306
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:37,746
So long, suckers.


1306
01:31:48,225 --> 01:31:53,746
[ Practicing Spanish ]

1307
01:32:12,437 --> 01:32:14,849
Wait here, Mr. Cicotte.

1308
01:32:33,725 --> 01:32:34,995
- Eddie.

1309
01:32:35,027 --> 01:32:37,404
This is the man
handling the grand jury, Eddie.

1310
01:32:37,439 --> 01:32:40,708
He's got the goods on you.
Just come clean, he'll take care of you.

1311
01:32:40,732 --> 01:32:42,075
- Eddie.

1312
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:43,773
- Sign this, Eddie.

1313
01:32:58,817 --> 01:33:00,524
I know what you wanna know.

1314
01:33:02,554 --> 01:33:04,864
I know.

1315
01:33:09,294 --> 01:33:11,501
Yeah, we were crooked.

1316
01:33:15,267 --> 01:33:17,508
We were crooked!

1317
01:33:21,473 --> 01:33:23,453
- What's the story?
- What can you tell us?

1318
01:33:23,475 --> 01:33:25,216
- Was it fixed, Eddie?

1319
01:33:25,244 --> 01:33:27,452
- Who was the brains, Eddie?
- Did you get immunity, Eddie?

1319
01:33:27,644 --> 01:33:29,852
For spilling the beans.
Did you get immunity?

1320
01:33:29,882 --> 01:33:31,020
What's that?

1321
01:33:31,049 --> 01:33:33,825
- They just wanna
clean up the gamblers, Joe...

1322
01:33:33,852 --> 01:33:35,354
not the ball players.

1323
01:33:37,322 --> 01:33:39,928
I gotta stay out of trouble.
- They don't want you in jail.

1324
01:33:39,958 --> 01:33:43,531
They want you to be a witness.
Now, you just sign right there.

1325
01:33:44,563 --> 01:33:45,598
My wife usually--

1326
01:33:45,631 --> 01:33:48,077
- You gotta sign to be a witness, Joe.
Everybody does.

1327
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:51,240
Eddie signed it. Lefty...

1328
01:34:08,654 --> 01:34:11,601
- What's the scoop here, Hap?
- Yeah, the word is that you made a bundle!

1329
01:34:11,623 --> 01:34:13,330
Yeah, sure, I saw some cash.

1329
01:34:13,363 --> 01:34:15,730
They promised us all 20,000 each
and all I saw was 5.

1330
01:34:15,761 --> 01:34:18,002
What am I gonna do?
Call the cops?

1331
01:34:18,030 --> 01:34:21,136
- You looked pretty good out there
for a guy dumping games.

1332
01:34:21,166 --> 01:34:22,406
It's something that
must have come over me.

1333
01:34:22,434 --> 01:34:24,471
- You mean you
double-crossed the gamblers?

1334
01:34:24,503 --> 01:34:26,608
No. No, I'm a man of my word.

1335
01:34:26,638 --> 01:34:29,915
- So, why did you do it, Hap?
Somebody lean on you?

1336
01:34:29,942 --> 01:34:31,922
Everybody else was getting some.

1337
01:34:31,944 --> 01:34:33,945
I figured without the pitchers
we're going to lose anyway.

1337
01:34:33,979 --> 01:34:35,585
So, why shouldn't I get fat, too?

1338
01:34:35,614 --> 01:34:38,788
I may be dumb, fellas,
but I'm not stúpid.

1339
01:34:40,819 --> 01:34:43,595
Well, that wasn't so bad, was it, Joe?

1340
01:34:43,622 --> 01:34:45,898
Kinda felt good
to get it off my chest.

1341
01:34:45,924 --> 01:34:48,803
You did the right thing, Joe.
We're proud of you.

1342
01:34:48,827 --> 01:34:50,864
- What did you say, Joe?

1343
01:34:50,896 --> 01:34:53,536
- Were you in on it?

1344
01:34:53,565 --> 01:34:56,011
- C'mon, who was the big cheese?
Who did all the brain work?

1345
01:34:56,034 --> 01:34:57,844
- Why'd you wait so long
to spill it, Joe?

1345
01:34:57,878 --> 01:34:59,044
A hard guy.

1346
01:34:59,070 --> 01:35:00,372
Swede is a hard guy.
- Joe!

1347
01:35:01,473 --> 01:35:03,976
Say it ain't so, Joe.

1348
01:35:04,009 --> 01:35:06,455
Say it ain't so!

1349
01:35:09,715 --> 01:35:11,353
- Wait, Joe!

1350
01:35:11,383 --> 01:35:13,021
- Joe!

1351
01:35:13,051 --> 01:35:14,689
- Wait, Joe!

1352
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:16,165
Joe...!

1353
01:35:29,701 --> 01:35:32,272
I'd like to introduce you
to Mr. Ben Short,

1354
01:35:32,304 --> 01:35:35,979
Mr. Tom Nash and Mr. Michael Ahearn.

1355
01:35:36,008 --> 01:35:37,817
Now, you may not be
familiar with their names

1356
01:35:37,843 --> 01:35:43,088
but I would say they are the Ty Cobb,
Tris Speaker and Zack Wheat

1357
01:35:43,115 --> 01:35:44,856
of the legal world.

1358
01:35:44,883 --> 01:35:46,920
Who's the Babe Ruth?

1359
01:35:46,952 --> 01:35:48,363
That's me.

1360
01:35:50,255 --> 01:35:54,294
Now, these are the men who are going to
be taking care of you during the trial.

1361
01:35:54,326 --> 01:35:56,829
You have only two choices.

1362
01:35:56,862 --> 01:36:00,810
Do exactly what we tell you to do
or go to jail.

1363
01:36:00,832 --> 01:36:03,540
You guys are such hot shots, you don't
come cheap. Who's footin' the bill?

1364
01:36:03,568 --> 01:36:07,072
Well, you boys have a lot of fans in this town.
Some of them are very wealthy people.

1365
01:36:07,105 --> 01:36:08,209
How about a name?

1366
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:10,982
Rule number one in a conspiracy trial...

1367
01:36:11,009 --> 01:36:15,691
The less you know,
the better off you are.

1368
01:36:15,914 --> 01:36:18,326
Mr. Rothstein feels

1369
01:36:18,350 --> 01:36:20,387
that he and your Mr. Comiskey

1370
01:36:20,419 --> 01:36:23,059
have certain interests in common.

1371
01:36:23,088 --> 01:36:24,897
Negative publicity can be very bad

1372
01:36:24,923 --> 01:36:27,062
for both of their businesses.

1373
01:36:27,092 --> 01:36:29,129
What does he want?

1374
01:36:29,161 --> 01:36:30,731
The confessions.

1375
01:36:33,331 --> 01:36:35,038
And, the players?

1376
01:36:35,067 --> 01:36:38,480
I'm certain you can help them understand
where their best interests lie.

1377
01:36:38,503 --> 01:36:40,278
They'll do what they're told.

1378
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:45,180
If I had the jack
I'd get my own damn lawyer.

1379
01:36:45,210 --> 01:36:48,020
Commy won't let us
have our series bonuses.

1380
01:36:48,046 --> 01:36:50,617
Who do you think is paying
for the guys you've got?

1381
01:36:50,649 --> 01:36:52,526
Think it's Commy?

1382
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:57,691
Put your shoulders back.

1383
01:36:57,722 --> 01:36:59,224
Of course it's him.

1384
01:36:59,257 --> 01:37:01,328
You think he's going to let
the best ball players in the game

1385
01:37:01,359 --> 01:37:04,897
slip away without a fight?

1386
01:37:04,930 --> 01:37:06,967
You look handsome.

1387
01:37:08,233 --> 01:37:11,146
I look like a future jailbird.

1388
01:37:11,169 --> 01:37:13,149
Sox trial starts today!

1389
01:37:13,171 --> 01:37:16,846
Get the news!
Trial starts for 'black' Sox!

1390
01:37:16,875 --> 01:37:19,378
Sox trial starts today!

1391
01:37:28,086 --> 01:37:30,191
It looks like schools's out.

1392
01:37:30,222 --> 01:37:31,462
There's Commy's lawyer.

1393
01:37:31,490 --> 01:37:33,663
He's got counsel lined up for the boys.

1394
01:37:33,692 --> 01:37:35,729
I thought Commy was
testifying against them.

1395
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:37,569
Depends on which way the ball rolls.

1396
01:37:37,596 --> 01:37:38,973
If Commy says one thing

1397
01:37:38,997 --> 01:37:41,307
that will hurt him in the cash register,
I'll eat my hat.

1398
01:37:41,333 --> 01:37:44,109
Three signed confessions.
That's a tough hand to beat.

1399
01:37:44,136 --> 01:37:47,709
This is Chicago, my friend.
Anything can happen.

1400
01:37:47,739 --> 01:37:49,309
- Here they are!

1401
01:38:37,322 --> 01:38:39,268
Edward Cicotte...

1402
01:38:39,291 --> 01:38:41,771
Joseph Jefferson Jackson...

1403
01:38:41,793 --> 01:38:43,773
Arnold Gandil...

1404
01:38:43,795 --> 01:38:45,934
Charles Risberg...

1405
01:38:45,964 --> 01:38:48,274
Oscar Felsch...

1406
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:50,439
Frederick McMullen...

1407
01:38:50,468 --> 01:38:52,277
Claude Williams...

1408
01:38:52,304 --> 01:38:54,477
and George Weaver are hereby accused

1409
01:38:54,506 --> 01:38:57,612
of conspiracy to
commit a confidence game 

1410
01:38:57,642 --> 01:39:01,351
on one Charles Nims.

1411
01:39:01,379 --> 01:39:03,882
Who the hell is Charles Nims?

1412
01:39:03,915 --> 01:39:07,158
Some sucker who bet on us in the series.

1413
01:39:11,990 --> 01:39:15,563
When did you first
become aware of the conspiracy?

1414
01:39:15,594 --> 01:39:18,165
You mean the possibility of a conspiracy?

1415
01:39:18,196 --> 01:39:21,473
- Pardon me,
the possibility of a conspiracy.

1416
01:39:21,499 --> 01:39:23,536
Shortly after the series began.

1417
01:39:23,568 --> 01:39:24,842
And, you took no action?

1418
01:39:24,869 --> 01:39:27,247
I informed commissioner Ban Johnson,

1419
01:39:27,272 --> 01:39:30,253
I hired private detectives
to check on the players

1420
01:39:30,275 --> 01:39:33,256
and I personnaly kept
a scorecard of every game.

1421
01:39:33,278 --> 01:39:34,484
What did you find?

1422
01:39:34,512 --> 01:39:38,255
Hearsay. Nothing that would warrant

1423
01:39:38,283 --> 01:39:40,889
publically slandering honest ball players.

1424
01:39:42,420 --> 01:39:43,763
If they're honest.

1425
01:39:43,788 --> 01:39:45,529
So, you think they're innocent.

1426
01:39:45,557 --> 01:39:47,366
I'll abide by the ruling of the court.

1427
01:39:47,392 --> 01:39:50,168
- Why are you
appearing today for the prosecution?

1428
01:39:50,195 --> 01:39:53,438
I owe it to baseball.
- So, you are making an accusation.

1429
01:39:53,465 --> 01:39:55,945
Not if they're innocent.
- But, you have suspicions.

1430
01:39:55,967 --> 01:39:59,278
They have been
indicted by a criminal court!

1431
01:39:59,304 --> 01:40:03,446
If that isn't suspicious,
I don't know what the heck is!

1432
01:40:06,344 --> 01:40:09,985
They pitched it to me.
They asked me if I knew somebody

1433
01:40:10,015 --> 01:40:12,427
willing to put up money
if they dumped the series.

1434
01:40:12,450 --> 01:40:14,157
- And, you made this connection?

1435
01:40:14,185 --> 01:40:15,565
I know a few people.

1435
01:40:15,598 --> 01:40:18,065
- Did you ever stop to think
about the legality of your action?

1436
01:40:18,089 --> 01:40:21,332
Introducing people
who want to get together?

1437
01:40:21,359 --> 01:40:23,430
Bettin' on the Reds?

1438
01:40:23,461 --> 01:40:27,238
I was just acting on a tip
from inside dope, like any guy would.

1439
01:40:27,265 --> 01:40:30,303
And, how much did you profit
from your inside dope?

1440
01:40:30,335 --> 01:40:32,645
Not a red cent.

1441
01:40:32,671 --> 01:40:35,481
They busted me in the third game.

1442
01:40:35,507 --> 01:40:36,645
- So, the players doublecrossed you?

1443
01:40:36,675 --> 01:40:40,122
There's no honesty in this world.

1444
01:40:40,145 --> 01:40:43,752
In fact, your reason for testifying
is revenge, isn't it, Bill?

1445
01:40:43,782 --> 01:40:46,888
If the players had really been crooked
and lost the third game

1446
01:40:46,918 --> 01:40:48,488
you would have been satisfied.

1447
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:52,593
You think you're even with them now?
- I will be before I leave here.

1448
01:40:52,624 --> 01:40:55,605
You don't like me much, do you, Bill?

1449
01:40:55,627 --> 01:40:57,573
Sure I do, Ben.

1450
01:40:57,595 --> 01:41:00,576
If we'd a had a smart fellow like you
at the head of this deal

1451
01:41:00,598 --> 01:41:02,475
we'd all be rich now.

1452
01:41:06,538 --> 01:41:08,779
- Who was present at this meeting?

1453
01:41:08,807 --> 01:41:10,480
Chick Gandil...

1454
01:41:10,508 --> 01:41:12,044
Risberg...

1455
01:41:12,077 --> 01:41:14,079
Hap Felsch...

1456
01:41:14,112 --> 01:41:16,854
Cicotte,
Williams, McMullen...

1457
01:41:16,881 --> 01:41:18,383
and Buck Weaver.

1458
01:41:18,416 --> 01:41:20,157
Joe Jackson was not present?

1459
01:41:20,185 --> 01:41:22,756
No, but he knew what was going on,

1460
01:41:22,787 --> 01:41:24,596
just like he said in the confession.

1461
01:41:24,622 --> 01:41:27,068
To what confession are you referring?

1462
01:41:27,092 --> 01:41:29,868
The confession he gave to the grand jury.

1463
01:41:29,894 --> 01:41:31,669
Can I ask that the prosecution

1464
01:41:31,696 --> 01:41:34,302
produce these alleged confessions?

1465
01:41:34,332 --> 01:41:36,073
Please bring them forward.

1466
01:41:37,502 --> 01:41:39,539
We don't have them, your honor.

1467
01:41:39,571 --> 01:41:41,517
They've been stolen.

1468
01:41:45,176 --> 01:41:46,177
Order!

1469
01:41:49,281 --> 01:41:50,892
Order!

1470
01:41:50,915 --> 01:41:53,657
Sit down, or I'm going to clear this court.

1471
01:41:53,685 --> 01:41:55,892
Must have cost somebody an arm and a leg.

1472
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:57,922
Rothstein?
- Or Comiskey?

1473
01:41:57,956 --> 01:42:01,460
Or, maybe Rothstein's arm
and Comiskey's leg?

1474
01:42:02,861 --> 01:42:05,273

1475
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,412
I want you to move out to the farm

1476
01:42:11,436 --> 01:42:13,416
if I go to jail.

1477
01:42:13,438 --> 01:42:15,645
You think they'll decide guilty?

1478
01:42:18,510 --> 01:42:20,820
I always figured it was talent

1479
01:42:20,845 --> 01:42:22,290
that made a man big, you know,

1480
01:42:22,313 --> 01:42:24,384
if I was the best at something?

1481
01:42:24,416 --> 01:42:27,090
I mean, we're the guys they come to see.

1482
01:42:27,118 --> 01:42:30,031
Without us there ain't a ball game.

1483
01:42:30,054 --> 01:42:33,035
Yeah, but look at who's holding the money
and look at who's facing a jail cell.

1484
01:42:33,057 --> 01:42:35,503
See, talent don't mean nothin'!

1485
01:42:37,061 --> 01:42:40,634
And, where's Comiskey and Sullivan...

1486
01:42:40,665 --> 01:42:42,508
Attell, Rothstein?

1487
01:42:44,068 --> 01:42:47,606
Out in the back room cuttin' up profits,
that's where.

1488
01:42:49,073 --> 01:42:51,519
That's the damn conspiracy.

1489
01:42:52,777 --> 01:42:54,188
- You woulda won, too.

1490
01:42:54,212 --> 01:42:57,159
You woulda beat those guys so easy.

1491
01:42:57,182 --> 01:43:00,527
Well, won't nobody ever know that now.

1492
01:43:05,089 --> 01:43:08,093
You lived and worked
with these men every day.

1493
01:43:08,126 --> 01:43:11,573
Shared trains and hotels and locker rooms.

1494
01:43:11,596 --> 01:43:13,906
And they never purposely or inadvertently

1495
01:43:13,932 --> 01:43:15,570
let slip of their plans?

1496
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:16,943
I find that hard to believe.

1497
01:43:16,968 --> 01:43:20,745
Relations between me
and most of the defendants...

1498
01:43:20,772 --> 01:43:22,149
were strained.

1499
01:43:22,173 --> 01:43:23,243
- Why was that?

1500
01:43:23,274 --> 01:43:25,276
Personal differences.

1501
01:43:25,310 --> 01:43:27,452
And yet you were positive
that there was a fix on.

1501
01:43:27,510 --> 01:43:29,952
It sounds like you
had it in for the defendants.

1502
01:43:29,981 --> 01:43:32,894
I suspected there was a fix.
- You said you were positive.

1503
01:43:32,917 --> 01:43:34,157
No, you said that.

1504
01:43:34,185 --> 01:43:37,325
And, if you want, I can show you
where in the court transcript.

1505
01:43:38,923 --> 01:43:41,563
- On what were these suspicions based?

1506
01:43:41,593 --> 01:43:43,539
Some of the guys didn't seem to be

1507
01:43:43,561 --> 01:43:46,041
putting out 100%.

1508
01:43:46,064 --> 01:43:48,510
- Mr. Collins, have you ever played a game

1509
01:43:48,533 --> 01:43:52,071
when you were not in
peak mental and physical condition?

1510
01:43:52,103 --> 01:43:53,548
Occasionally.

1511
01:43:53,571 --> 01:43:56,014
Have you ever played a game
where you were distracted,

1512
01:43:56,051 --> 01:43:57,484
or upset,

1513
01:43:57,519 --> 01:43:59,586
and couldn't find it in you
to give your best effort?

1514
01:43:59,611 --> 01:44:01,147
No.

1515
01:44:01,179 --> 01:44:03,955
- Couldn't or didn't put out 100%?

1516
01:44:03,982 --> 01:44:06,155
Didn't give it the old 'college try'?

1517
01:44:06,184 --> 01:44:08,494
No, never.

1518
01:44:09,654 --> 01:44:12,658
Then you're a very remarkable man,
Mr. Collins.

1519
01:44:12,690 --> 01:44:15,364
Well, you said it, I didn't.

1520
01:44:15,393 --> 01:44:18,374
Your honor, please. Can I say something?
This man is not asking the right questions!

1521
01:44:18,396 --> 01:44:20,467
Can we have some order here, please?

1522
01:44:20,498 --> 01:44:22,102
Your bunchng us all together!
And, who is he to talk?

1523
01:44:22,133 --> 01:44:24,977
Collins wouldn't even hit his own weight!
Your honor, if it pleases the court...

1524
01:44:25,003 --> 01:44:27,040
Sit down, Bucky.
- Shut up!

1525
01:44:27,071 --> 01:44:29,449
If it pleases the court I would
like to take the stand.

1526
01:44:29,474 --> 01:44:31,317
You'll take the stand when you're called.

1527
01:44:31,342 --> 01:44:33,322
What if they don't call me?

1528
01:44:33,344 --> 01:44:35,984
- Please be seated.
- Wait a minute. What if they don't call me?

1529
01:44:36,014 --> 01:44:38,494
Be seated.
- Your honor, I want a separate trial!

1530
01:44:38,516 --> 01:44:41,122
The fact that I never took a penny
hasn't been brought up once!

1531
01:44:41,152 --> 01:44:42,790
I hit .327 in the series!

1532
01:44:42,820 --> 01:44:44,225
I didn't make an error!

1532
01:44:44,264 --> 01:44:46,825
I'm being charged with a conspiracy
I didn't have nothin' to do with!

1533
01:44:48,126 --> 01:44:52,165
Sit down, Mr. Weaver, or I'm going to
have to hold you in contempt of this court!

1534
01:44:52,196 --> 01:44:54,403
- C'mon, Buck. Sit down.

1535
01:44:54,432 --> 01:44:57,003
Nobody's interested in your batting average.

1536
01:45:00,138 --> 01:45:03,415
- Would the prosecution
care to cross examine?

1537
01:45:04,409 --> 01:45:05,717
- No, your honor.

1538
01:45:08,413 --> 01:45:10,791
"Trial will continue tomorrow

1539
01:45:10,815 --> 01:45:13,193
"with 'black' Sox manager Kid Gleason

1540
01:45:13,217 --> 01:45:15,026
"expected to take the stand."

1541
01:45:15,053 --> 01:45:16,623
What's all this 'Black Sox' stuff?

1542
01:45:16,654 --> 01:45:19,328
Smart guys.
Reporters think they're smart guys.

1543
01:45:19,357 --> 01:45:22,133
All I wanna do is go back and play ball
and forget about it.

1544
01:45:23,528 --> 01:45:26,304
I don't know if they're
going to let you do that, Joe.

1545
01:45:26,331 --> 01:45:29,335
There's all this stuff about how
baseball can never have no cheaters.

1546
01:45:29,367 --> 01:45:31,074
I played good!

1547
01:45:31,102 --> 01:45:33,139
They gotta let me play!

1548
01:45:35,139 --> 01:45:37,415
If they don't, what are you all gonna do?

1549
01:45:40,645 --> 01:45:42,181
I don't know.

1550
01:46:02,100 --> 01:46:05,047
- How long were you a player
in the big leagues, Mr. Gleason?

1551
01:46:05,069 --> 01:46:08,607
A long time. Over 20 years.
I was a pitcher.

1552
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:13,020
- As a pitcher you had a great deal
of control over the outcome of a game.

1553
01:46:13,044 --> 01:46:16,321
Well, sometimes the other team
had more control than I did...

1554
01:46:16,347 --> 01:46:19,760
but, yes. The pitcher, the catcher,
they had the most control.

1555
01:46:19,784 --> 01:46:23,163
- Were there gamblers involved in sports
in your day, Mr. Gleason?

1556
01:46:23,187 --> 01:46:24,791
Sure. How you gonna keep them out?

1557
01:46:24,822 --> 01:46:28,360
- Were there incidents
where games were thrown?

1558
01:46:29,560 --> 01:46:31,301
- I heard stories.

1559
01:46:31,329 --> 01:46:33,172
- Were you ever approached personally?

1560
01:46:33,197 --> 01:46:35,871
No. No, not personally.

1561
01:46:35,900 --> 01:46:39,507
I, uh... I had a reputation...

1562
01:46:39,537 --> 01:46:43,451
for being the kind of guy who
wouldn't go for something like that.

1563
01:46:43,474 --> 01:46:45,317
- So, you never had any thought

1564
01:46:45,343 --> 01:46:46,754
of instigating a deal?

1565
01:46:46,778 --> 01:46:48,655
Oh, no, no. I never--

1566
01:46:51,816 --> 01:46:54,558
I mean I can see, though, where a--

1567
01:46:54,585 --> 01:46:58,397
Well, maybe if a guy feels
he's being underpaid and, uh, maybe...

1568
01:46:58,423 --> 01:47:03,668
falls in with the wrong kind of people
and they feed him a line how he could--

1569
01:47:05,730 --> 01:47:08,074
You know, people are human.

1570
01:47:08,099 --> 01:47:10,340
But, I never--

1571
01:47:10,368 --> 01:47:12,871
Well, not that I'm a 'holy Joe'...
Nothin' like that--

1572
01:47:12,904 --> 01:47:14,440
- You don't have to apologize

1573
01:47:14,472 --> 01:47:16,679
for being honest, Mr. Gleason.

1574
01:47:16,708 --> 01:47:18,585
Yeah.

1575
01:47:18,609 --> 01:47:20,680
- Well...

1576
01:47:20,712 --> 01:47:24,626
What do you think of these
players of yours now, Mr. Gleason?

1577
01:47:35,259 --> 01:47:39,139
I think they're the greatest ball club
I ever seen. Period.

1578
01:48:10,561 --> 01:48:11,835
Hey, Buck.

1579
01:48:11,863 --> 01:48:13,900
Hi, fellas.

1580
01:48:13,931 --> 01:48:16,172
Seen you outside court today.

1581
01:48:16,200 --> 01:48:18,737
Some circus, huh?

1582
01:48:18,770 --> 01:48:21,250
Is it true what they're sayin' in there?

1583
01:48:21,272 --> 01:48:23,252
About Joe and the others.

1584
01:48:23,274 --> 01:48:26,414
Don't be too down on the guys, fellas.

1585
01:48:26,444 --> 01:48:30,119
When you grow up things get...
complicated.

1586
01:48:30,148 --> 01:48:32,526
You didn't do nothin' wrong, did you, Buck?

1587
01:48:33,885 --> 01:48:35,489
Guess I never grew up.

1588
01:48:45,930 --> 01:48:48,171
I still get such a bang out of it...

1589
01:48:48,199 --> 01:48:49,678
playing ball.

1590
01:48:50,868 --> 01:48:53,474
Same as I did when I first come up.

1591
01:48:53,504 --> 01:48:56,383
When you get out there
and the stands are full...

1592
01:48:56,407 --> 01:48:58,182
everybody's cheering.

1593
01:48:59,610 --> 01:49:02,955
It's like everybody in the world
come to see you.

1594
01:49:02,980 --> 01:49:06,427
Then, inside, the players...
They're yacking it up.

1595
01:49:06,450 --> 01:49:08,555
The pitcher throws...

1596
01:49:08,586 --> 01:49:11,362
You look for that 'pill'...

1597
01:49:11,389 --> 01:49:14,495
and suddenly there's nothing else
in the ballpark except you and it.

1598
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:18,902
And, sometimes, when you feelin' right...

1599
01:49:18,930 --> 01:49:20,637
there's a groove there...

1600
01:49:20,665 --> 01:49:23,544
and the bat just eases into it

1601
01:49:23,568 --> 01:49:25,639
and meets that ball.

1602
01:49:25,670 --> 01:49:29,083
When the bat meets that ball you
can see that ball just give...

1603
01:49:29,106 --> 01:49:32,485
You know it's gonna go a long way.

1604
01:49:32,510 --> 01:49:35,150
Damn! It feels like
you're gonna live forever.

1605
01:49:40,151 --> 01:49:42,358
You couldn't give that up.

1606
01:49:44,088 --> 01:49:46,159
Not for nothin'.

1607
01:49:48,259 --> 01:49:50,398
How do you think their
going to call it tomorrow?

1608
01:49:52,163 --> 01:49:55,940
You stay out at third base next season you're
going to see Buck Weaver playing his butt off!

1609
01:49:55,967 --> 01:49:57,571
Yeah!

1610
01:50:01,372 --> 01:50:04,148
"The aforementioned parties
are also accused

1611
01:50:04,175 --> 01:50:06,849
"of conspiracy to
commit a confidence game,

1612
01:50:06,878 --> 01:50:11,725
"an offense which, in this case, carries
a maximum penalty of five years in jail

1613
01:50:11,749 --> 01:50:14,252
" and a $2,000 fine."

1614
01:50:14,285 --> 01:50:15,889
- Does anyone have a statement to make

1615
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:17,900
before the final verdict is made?

1616
01:50:17,922 --> 01:50:19,833
I do, your honor.

1617
01:50:19,857 --> 01:50:22,463
- Very well. Mr. Weaver.

1618
01:50:22,493 --> 01:50:24,404
I want to put on the record somewhere

1619
01:50:24,428 --> 01:50:27,341
that I asked for a separate trial
and I was refused.

1620
01:50:27,365 --> 01:50:30,107
That evidence of my playing
in world series games was not admitted,

1621
01:50:30,134 --> 01:50:33,047
and that I never got a chance
to take the stand on my own behalf.

1622
01:50:33,070 --> 01:50:34,777
It will be so noted.

1623
01:50:34,805 --> 01:50:36,910
A big setup!

1624
01:50:39,176 --> 01:50:40,712
Will the foreman read the veredict?

1625
01:50:40,745 --> 01:50:42,884
Yes, your honor.

1626
01:50:44,916 --> 01:50:48,523
We find the defendants...

1627
01:50:48,552 --> 01:50:51,931
not guilty on all charges.

1628
01:51:00,498 --> 01:51:02,739
That was a bigger fix than the series.

1629
01:51:02,767 --> 01:51:05,873
Gamblers 8, baseball nothing.

1630
01:51:09,573 --> 01:51:11,712
You got your ball club back, Commy!

1631
01:51:11,742 --> 01:51:14,484
I will make them pay for this!

1632
01:51:45,977 --> 01:51:47,456
- Hey, Chick!

1633
01:51:47,478 --> 01:51:49,458
Hey, small world, huh?!

1634
01:51:49,480 --> 01:51:51,585
Well done!

1635
01:51:51,615 --> 01:51:53,288
Make room for the 'clean' Sox!

1636
01:51:55,619 --> 01:51:57,667
How you feeling, Joe?
- Like a million bucks!

1637
01:51:58,090 --> 01:52:02,461
I've seen some lawyerin' in my day, but you
people in Chicago got some lawyerin' birds!

1638
01:52:02,499 --> 01:52:05,599
Those guys could talk a  buffalo
off a nickel if they put their minds to it!

1639
01:52:05,629 --> 01:52:09,577
What did I tell you, partner?
It was in the bag all the time.

1640
01:52:12,103 --> 01:52:14,379
"Regardless of the veredict of juries...

1641
01:52:16,007 --> 01:52:19,682
"no player who throws a ball game...

1642
01:52:19,710 --> 01:52:23,487
"no player who undertakes
or promises to throw a game...

1643
01:52:24,482 --> 01:52:26,257
"no player who sits in conference

1644
01:52:26,283 --> 01:52:29,856
"with a bunch of
crooked players and gamblers...

1645
01:52:29,887 --> 01:52:34,165
"where the ways and means
of throwing a ball game are discussed,

1646
01:52:34,191 --> 01:52:38,071
"and does not promptly
tell his club about it,

1647
01:52:38,095 --> 01:52:42,669
"will ever play
professional baseball again."

1648
01:52:44,535 --> 01:52:46,037
To baseball!

1649
01:53:03,120 --> 01:53:04,861
- Ball!

1650
01:53:04,889 --> 01:53:07,130
Fellow's playing kind of
shallow in center, isn't he?

1651
01:53:07,158 --> 01:53:08,262
He's new.

1652
01:53:08,292 --> 01:53:11,796
Damned if that doesn't look like him.

1653
01:53:11,829 --> 01:53:13,672
Look like who?

1654
01:53:13,697 --> 01:53:15,506
Nah, couldn't be.

1655
01:53:15,533 --> 01:53:18,275
He's gonna get burned
playing in so close.

1656
01:53:30,214 --> 01:53:33,161
How did he get back there?!
- Who is that guy?

1657
01:53:35,853 --> 01:53:37,264
It is. It's him!

1658
01:53:37,288 --> 01:53:40,064
What's his name... the new guy?
- He don't look so new to me.

1659
01:53:40,091 --> 01:53:41,764
It says his name is Brown.

1660
01:53:41,792 --> 01:53:43,999
A name is easy to change.
It's him.

1661
01:53:44,028 --> 01:53:45,974
Who is 'him'?

1662
01:53:45,996 --> 01:53:47,634
It's Joe Jackson.

1663
01:53:47,665 --> 01:53:49,542
What?!
- Get outa here!

1664
01:53:49,567 --> 01:53:50,978
- Who's Joe Jackson?

1665
01:53:51,001 --> 01:53:53,174
- Look at how he's hitting us.
He's killing us out there.

1666
01:53:53,204 --> 01:53:55,150
A double. Two home runs.

1667
01:53:55,172 --> 01:53:58,176
These bushers make peanuts, Les.
Jackson made a fortune on those games.

1668
01:53:58,209 --> 01:53:59,586
It's him!

1669
01:53:59,610 --> 01:54:01,021
You ever see him play?

1670
01:54:01,045 --> 01:54:02,422
Yeah, I saw pictures.

1671
01:54:02,446 --> 01:54:04,016
Pictures!

1672
01:54:05,449 --> 01:54:06,951
- I saw him play.

1673
01:54:07,985 --> 01:54:09,191
Yeah?

1674
01:54:10,521 --> 01:54:12,159
What do you think?

1675
01:54:14,225 --> 01:54:15,636
He was the best!

1676
01:54:16,894 --> 01:54:18,532
Run, hit, throw...

1677
01:54:19,597 --> 01:54:21,508
He was the best.

1678
01:54:25,503 --> 01:54:26,504
So, what do you think?

1679
01:54:27,338 --> 01:54:28,681
Is that him?

1680
01:54:30,441 --> 01:54:31,579
Nah.

1681
01:54:33,577 --> 01:54:35,921
Those fellows are all gone now.

1682
01:54:43,517 --> 01:54:46,224
Home run!

1683
01:54:49,793 --> 01:54:50,771
- Stand up!

1684
01:54:50,794 --> 01:54:52,432
You got it beat!

1685
01:54:52,463 --> 01:54:53,703
Safe!

1686
01:54:56,534 --> 01:54:59,071
- Yeah. Brown, huh?

1687
01:54:59,103 --> 01:55:00,707
- Who is Joe Jackson?

1688
01:55:00,738 --> 01:55:04,345
One of the guys who
threw the series back in '19.

1689
01:55:04,375 --> 01:55:06,878
One of them bums from Chicago, kid.

1690
01:55:06,911 --> 01:55:09,118
One of the 'black' Sox.

1691
01:59:41,996 --> 01:59:43,635
