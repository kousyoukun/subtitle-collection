2
00:01:58,092 --> 00:01:59,802
Fuck.

3
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,696
Let me be blunt.

4
00:02:18,779 --> 00:02:23,451
Art would not exist without criticism.

5
00:02:24,452 --> 00:02:28,914
It would not exist.

6
00:02:29,915 --> 00:02:34,253
I like to think of myself
and my fellow critics, collectively,

7
00:02:34,337 --> 00:02:39,050
as the banks on a river,
and art is the water that flows between us.

8
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:42,720
And we work to channel this flow,

9
00:02:42,803 --> 00:02:45,723
guide it, to restrain it,
you might even say.

10
00:02:46,724 --> 00:02:52,229
Because without banks, even the greatest
of torrents would be, what?

11
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:57,735
Floodplain, listless expanse
of mud and flies.

12
00:02:57,818 --> 00:03:00,613
<i>Now, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

13
00:03:00,696 --> 00:03:03,783
please examine this painting, if you will.

14
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:06,369
What do you feel?

15
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,956
Indifference, am I correct?

16
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:12,333
You are unmoved.

17
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:16,170
Let's be honest, this is no more interesting
than your average wallpaper, is it?

18
00:03:16,253 --> 00:03:19,924
Look at the brushstrokes, so...
So rough and clumsy.

19
00:03:20,007 --> 00:03:22,468
Almost like a child's painting, no?

20
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:28,182
Is anyone here familiar
with the work of Nils Ingen?

21
00:03:28,265 --> 00:03:31,227
Well, don't be ashamed.
He's not very well-known in America.

22
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,896
Don't be ashamed.
He's not very well-known in America.

23
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,357
Let me tell you a little bit about Nils.

24
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:41,445
Nils was 16 and already something
of a prodigy when the Nazis invaded Norway.

25
00:03:41,529 --> 00:03:46,325
Nils and his twin sister joined
the Resistance a year into the occupation.

26
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:48,494
They were betrayed.

27
00:03:50,162 --> 00:03:54,750
Betrayed, arrested and transported
to the concentration camp in Buchenwald.

28
00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:01,048
Nils kept himself and his sister alive
by painting portraits of the camp officers.

29
00:04:01,132 --> 00:04:05,261
And this is something
for which he felt great shame after the war.

30
00:04:05,344 --> 00:04:07,805
So Nils vowed two things:

31
00:04:08,973 --> 00:04:11,434
Never to paint another human figure

32
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:14,312
and never to touch a brush again.

33
00:04:14,395 --> 00:04:15,563
And, therefore...

34
00:04:16,772 --> 00:04:19,107
...the rough working of the paint.

35
00:04:19,191 --> 00:04:21,652
All of Nils's postwar canvases
were undertaken

36
00:04:21,736 --> 00:04:25,698
either with a palette knife
or with his fingers.

37
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:29,660
Nils titled this particular painting, <i>Nora,</i>
after his sister.

38
00:04:31,954 --> 00:04:35,666
She died, in 1955, of consumption,

39
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,336
which she contracted at Buchenwald.

40
00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:40,796
And that gray...

41
00:04:42,381 --> 00:04:43,591
And that... And that gray...

42
00:04:43,674 --> 00:04:47,011
That gray, vaguely avian shape...

43
00:04:49,138 --> 00:04:53,309
some see that as a representation
of Nora's soul,

44
00:04:53,392 --> 00:04:59,065
slipping its earthly bonds, free at last,
after enduring so much horror here.

45
00:05:00,107 --> 00:05:02,610
This painting was Nils's last painting.

46
00:05:02,693 --> 00:05:05,279
With Nora dead, he refused to eat anything,

47
00:05:05,363 --> 00:05:09,909
and nothing but water passed his lips
for the next 27 days.

48
00:05:09,992 --> 00:05:13,537
He continued to work on the canvas
as he weakened,

49
00:05:13,621 --> 00:05:17,249
and reportedly that bird-like shape

50
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,794
was the last detail that he added.

51
00:05:19,877 --> 00:05:24,256
So I suppose you could see this painting...

52
00:05:25,466 --> 00:05:27,009
as a suicide note.

53
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:31,472
A cri de coeur, famous last words,
cry from the heart.

54
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:38,938
Looks like a different painting now,
doesn't it?

55
00:05:39,021 --> 00:05:42,275
It looks like a different painting now.

56
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,778
- Doesn't it?
- Absolutely.

57
00:05:45,861 --> 00:05:48,489
There's a poignancy to it
that you hadn't noticed before,

58
00:05:48,572 --> 00:05:51,534
and there's far more technical skill
than you first assumed.

59
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:55,496
And all of this simply because of what I,
as a critic

60
00:05:55,579 --> 00:05:57,248
and an expert, have shared with you.

61
00:05:57,331 --> 00:06:02,586
I suppose you could say that I have shaped
your experience of this painting.

62
00:06:03,713 --> 00:06:06,465
Would anyone like a print?

63
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:11,304
Let me...

64
00:06:11,387 --> 00:06:14,181
Let me share one last detail with you.

65
00:06:14,265 --> 00:06:17,560
Everything I just told you
about Nils and Nora...

66
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:20,396
Lies. Lies.

67
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,024
Lies. Just a pack of lies.

68
00:06:23,107 --> 00:06:24,859
I painted this painting.

69
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,238
And it's trash. And you can see that, right?

70
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,698
It took me 30 minutes.

71
00:06:30,781 --> 00:06:34,869
And it's just paint slapped down
without any real care or inspiration.

72
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,623
So is anyone still interested in a print?

73
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:43,628
No, I thought not.

74
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:49,050
I single-handedly made you believe
that this was a masterpiece.

75
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:52,595
You believed, you have to admit it.

76
00:06:53,804 --> 00:06:56,474
That, my dear friends,
is the power of the critic,

77
00:06:56,557 --> 00:07:00,227
and that's why you should be careful
with someone like me.

78
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:07,151
Thank you. Thank you.

79
00:07:33,135 --> 00:07:35,680
You're not really how I imagined
an art critic would look.

80
00:07:35,763 --> 00:07:40,059
Well, you know what they say
about the book and its cover, Ms...?

81
00:07:40,142 --> 00:07:42,603
Hollis. Berenice Hollis.

82
00:07:43,604 --> 00:07:45,773
Are you interested in art, Ms. Hollis?

83
00:07:45,856 --> 00:07:48,401
I just came here for the potato chips.

84
00:07:48,484 --> 00:07:50,278
No offense, Mr. Figueras.

85
00:07:50,361 --> 00:07:53,656
I just reached a point in my life
where I appreciate the value of free things.

86
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:54,865
Oh, I see.

87
00:07:56,033 --> 00:07:57,785
So that painting...

88
00:07:58,786 --> 00:08:00,162
I'd like a print.

89
00:08:05,584 --> 00:08:07,253
There aren't any.

90
00:08:07,336 --> 00:08:11,507
That was just what you call
an oratorical gesture.

91
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,509
Oh, you're one of those.

92
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,971
- One of which?
- A liar.

93
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:21,684
That's harsh, don't you think?

94
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,603
If the shoe fits.

95
00:08:25,646 --> 00:08:27,023
Yeah.

96
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,131
Sorry.

97
00:08:52,214 --> 00:08:53,633
Sorry.

98
00:09:07,188 --> 00:09:08,648
Water?

99
00:09:11,901 --> 00:09:15,237
Ever wonder when something
is just starting, how it's gonna end?

100
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:16,197
Like what?

101
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,408
Anything. Us, say.

102
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,791
A week from now,
I'll be planning our wedding.

103
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:31,754
Then I'll take you to an opening,
and as I look across the room,

104
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:33,464
I'll see you talking to this artist,

105
00:09:33,547 --> 00:09:37,927
this broad-shouldered artist, sculptor.

106
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,137
Big hands.

107
00:09:40,221 --> 00:09:43,599
And as you leave with him,
you give me a little wave.

108
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:49,855
And I'll climb to the top of the duomo,
throw myself off in grief.

109
00:09:49,939 --> 00:09:51,774
You're gonna make me your whore.

110
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:55,653
I'll be turning tricks to support you
while you visit your galleries

111
00:09:55,736 --> 00:09:59,657
and you write your articles and you sip
champagne with your high-class friends.

112
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,367
- For love.
- That's right.

113
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:04,704
I'll catch some disease,
lose my teeth, go blind...

114
00:10:04,787 --> 00:10:06,789
- No.
- ...be dead in a year.

115
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:08,416
All for love.

116
00:10:08,499 --> 00:10:10,334
We'll have babies.

117
00:10:11,335 --> 00:10:14,422
Girl named Amy, boy named Matt.

118
00:10:14,505 --> 00:10:17,341
We'll move to the States,
Connecticut probably.

119
00:10:17,425 --> 00:10:20,511
Buy a house, porch with a swing
and a brook.

120
00:10:20,594 --> 00:10:21,762
Babbling.

121
00:10:21,846 --> 00:10:23,931
Of course. And a stone wall.

122
00:10:24,015 --> 00:10:25,182
And I'll die first.

123
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:28,936
Some sort of lingering cancer
that you'll nurse me through.

124
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,062
And then you.

125
00:10:30,146 --> 00:10:34,692
And our kids will insist
that you died of a broken heart.

126
00:10:35,693 --> 00:10:37,194
I'm gonna get up now.

127
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:38,696
Shower, leave.

128
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:41,407
We'll never see each other again.

129
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,993
All you gotta do is lie here
and let it happen.

130
00:10:45,328 --> 00:10:46,954
Got it?

131
00:10:47,038 --> 00:10:48,581
Got it.

132
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,359
Come in.

133
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,236
Want an upper?

134
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,196
Sure.

135
00:11:26,994 --> 00:11:28,955
What are you doing this weekend?

136
00:11:29,038 --> 00:11:30,498
What?

137
00:11:31,499 --> 00:11:34,919
You're supposed to ask me out
before you fuck me.

138
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,798
- Ever heard of Joseph Cassidy?
- The art dealer?

139
00:11:38,881 --> 00:11:41,550
- Yeah.
- Been invited to his estate.

140
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:42,843
You got rich friends.

141
00:11:42,927 --> 00:11:45,763
- Well, I've never met him.
- Then why the invite?

142
00:11:45,846 --> 00:11:48,516
I'm guessing he wants me to write
a catalog for his collection,

143
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:50,851
and it would be a nice gig
if I could land it.

144
00:11:50,935 --> 00:11:55,606
And I bet there'll be
some free cucumber sandwiches.

145
00:11:56,691 --> 00:11:58,150
So, what do you say?

146
00:11:58,234 --> 00:12:02,196
- You'll be my chauffeur?
- Share the driving?

147
00:12:50,494 --> 00:12:52,622
<i>James, hi.</i>

148
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,832
<i>It's Louisa, Louisa Prentes.</i>

149
00:12:54,915 --> 00:12:57,335
<i>It's rather awkward for me
to be calling you about this,</i>

150
00:12:57,418 --> 00:13:00,963
<i>but the check you gave me
was returned by my bank.</i>

151
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:02,715
<i>If you'd give me a call back, thanks.</i>

152
00:13:10,973 --> 00:13:12,642
Who died, little girl?

153
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,644
Your poor Norwegian.

154
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,520
I keep thinking he was real.

155
00:13:16,604 --> 00:13:17,980
He was real.

156
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:21,484
- You said you made him up.
- No, just the end.

157
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:24,028
Nils and Nora were real,

158
00:13:24,111 --> 00:13:28,407
and Nils survived for a time at Buchenwald
by painting the German officers.

159
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:31,243
- For a time.
- For a time.

160
00:13:31,327 --> 00:13:34,455
In medieval painting,
the fly represented sin,

161
00:13:34,538 --> 00:13:38,459
so if an artist added a fly to a portrait,
for instance,

162
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:41,379
it meant that that person was damned.

163
00:13:41,462 --> 00:13:43,756
I suppose you can see where this is headed.

164
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,633
Nils painted flies on the Germans.

165
00:13:45,716 --> 00:13:46,717
He did.

166
00:13:46,801 --> 00:13:52,390
Unfortunately, his camp commandant
was something of an amateur art historian,

167
00:13:52,473 --> 00:13:56,686
and he took exception,
and Nils was gutted like a deer,

168
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,729
- left out in the yard for the flies...
- Stop.

169
00:13:58,813 --> 00:14:01,023
...to feast on.

170
00:14:02,358 --> 00:14:04,110
You asked.

171
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:07,738
What about Nora?

172
00:14:07,822 --> 00:14:12,994
Nora spent her postwar years in Paris,
drinking too much and painting some.

173
00:14:13,077 --> 00:14:14,745
Badly, I'm afraid.

174
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:17,164
She just wasted away, basically.

175
00:14:17,248 --> 00:14:20,126
That was Nora's painting you showed us,
wasn't it?

176
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:23,713
Why didn't you say so?

177
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:26,924
Because my story's much more poignant,
Nils starving and everything.

178
00:14:27,008 --> 00:14:28,926
Yeah, but it's not true.

179
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,886
- Does that matter?
- Of course it matters.

180
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:34,140
That's what art's about, isn't it?
The truth.

181
00:14:34,223 --> 00:14:35,516
No.

182
00:14:36,601 --> 00:14:41,439
I mean, pumpkin, if it's just about telling
the truth, anybody could do it.

183
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,817
My job is to separate the good lies
from the bad ones.

184
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,069
And how do you do that?

185
00:14:48,404 --> 00:14:51,782
Well, is your name really Berenice?

186
00:14:55,286 --> 00:14:57,580
Why would I make that up?

187
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:59,498
That's not a yes.

188
00:14:59,582 --> 00:15:01,917
It's not a no either.

189
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:07,798
Okay.

190
00:16:02,103 --> 00:16:04,105
Let's get the bags.

191
00:16:39,223 --> 00:16:41,475
Lunch is in an hour. Please be prompt.

192
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:43,060
Thank you.

193
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,168
I was a kid...

194
00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:11,589
exactly the kind of place
I dreamed of living.

195
00:17:11,671 --> 00:17:13,174
Princess in a castle.

196
00:17:13,256 --> 00:17:14,925
How about you?

197
00:17:15,009 --> 00:17:17,469
What'd you wanna be when you were a kid?

198
00:17:17,553 --> 00:17:19,513
Oh, I was never a kid.

199
00:17:19,597 --> 00:17:22,099
I hatched from the egg like this,
fully grown.

200
00:17:22,183 --> 00:17:23,434
Come on.

201
00:17:24,435 --> 00:17:27,021
Seriously, you can't tell me
you never wanted to paint.

202
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,400
Have you ever been to New York?

203
00:17:32,401 --> 00:17:33,694
Yeah.

204
00:17:33,778 --> 00:17:38,783
You know those big banners they hang
outside the museums for special exhibitions?

205
00:17:40,076 --> 00:17:42,078
I wanted one.

206
00:17:45,206 --> 00:17:47,041
"Figueras."

207
00:17:48,042 --> 00:17:50,252
I had a teacher in art school.

208
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:51,796
Good teacher.

209
00:17:52,922 --> 00:17:55,758
She took me aside one day
and told me that I was much better

210
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:58,427
at talking about art than doing it,

211
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:01,764
and said it only had to be a tragedy
if I made it one.

212
00:18:02,765 --> 00:18:05,268
You still want that banner though,
don't you?

213
00:18:30,501 --> 00:18:32,878
Follow your heart.

214
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:48,436
Do you realize how many museums
that would consider this their centerpiece?

215
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:52,106
And here, it's just another slap of paint
on the wall.

216
00:18:52,189 --> 00:18:53,524
He live alone?

217
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:57,570
- Has that feel, doesn't it?
- Must be lonely.

218
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:02,158
- What?
- Man like Cassidy? It's a choice.

219
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:07,038
Women can't understand that as a rule,
the allure of solitude.

220
00:19:07,121 --> 00:19:10,166
- And you do?
- Oh, yeah. This is how I live too.

221
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:11,500
On a...

222
00:19:12,501 --> 00:19:15,379
slightly more modest scale, but still.

223
00:19:15,463 --> 00:19:17,089
Just a lone wolf, huh?

224
00:19:17,173 --> 00:19:20,092
Scoff all you want.
I've been a monk here in Italy.

225
00:19:20,176 --> 00:19:23,429
Art my only mistress.

226
00:19:31,395 --> 00:19:34,148
I bet you, he overpaid for these.

227
00:19:34,231 --> 00:19:37,652
And 10 years from now,
he won't be able to give them away.

228
00:19:37,735 --> 00:19:40,363
Would it help you, Mr. Figueras,
if I told you

229
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:43,449
that I had a terrible stammer
when I was a child?

230
00:19:43,532 --> 00:19:47,370
- Took me years to get over it.
- I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

231
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:50,247
A neighbor of mine gave me some advice.

232
00:19:50,331 --> 00:19:54,293
Try and sing through the words
to help ease their passage.

233
00:19:55,461 --> 00:20:00,800
This makes my attachment to these pictures
seem a bit sentimental, I know,

234
00:20:00,883 --> 00:20:03,219
but I like the reminder that they bring,

235
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:07,932
that I should never let
a thing's worth obscure its value.

236
00:20:08,015 --> 00:20:09,475
Ms. Hollis.

237
00:20:09,558 --> 00:20:11,060
Am I correct?

238
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:12,728
Joseph Cassidy.

239
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:16,524
- Welcome to my summer cottage.
- Thank you for having us.

240
00:20:16,607 --> 00:20:18,025
<i>Aperitivo,</i> anyone?

241
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:22,863
I really must apologize.

242
00:20:22,947 --> 00:20:27,285
I couldn't help but overhear
your conversation as I entered.

243
00:20:27,368 --> 00:20:29,078
It was fascinating.

244
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:31,622
People and their hunches.

245
00:20:31,706 --> 00:20:34,125
How some have the gift and others don't.

246
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:37,420
Always trust your hunches, my dear.
You have the gift.

247
00:20:38,421 --> 00:20:41,299
You were quite right to suspect
that Mr. Figueras here

248
00:20:41,382 --> 00:20:46,595
has been leading a decidedly un-monastic
existence during his Italian sojourn.

249
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:48,931
There was a Ms. Sofia Rosselli,

250
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:54,812
and then there was a Mrs. Louisa Prentes,
and then... Oh, come on.

251
00:20:54,895 --> 00:20:57,315
Don't look so uncomfortable, Mr. Figueras.

252
00:20:57,398 --> 00:21:01,027
I invited you over to my house,
I'm bound to make inquiries.

253
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:04,864
By the way, my home life,
you completely misread it.

254
00:21:04,947 --> 00:21:06,115
This is my wife's estate.

255
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:09,327
It's been in her family for generations.
If you'd have come here yesterday,

256
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,704
you would've found
the place swarming with people.

257
00:21:11,787 --> 00:21:15,207
I mean, children, grandchildren,
dogs, cats, nannies.

258
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:18,586
They all decamped for London this morning,
the whole bloody shooting match.

259
00:21:18,669 --> 00:21:23,341
Can still sort of smell them a bit though,
can't you?

260
00:21:23,424 --> 00:21:25,926
That sort of funny child smell.

261
00:21:27,303 --> 00:21:30,389
- Jim. Can I call you Jim?
- Please.

262
00:21:31,515 --> 00:21:36,604
Just winding you up. Why would you think
my children would have a peculiar smell?

263
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:43,152
Berenice, you've been a bit quiet.

264
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:45,988
- I hope we haven't bored you too much.
- Oh, not at all.

265
00:21:46,072 --> 00:21:49,075
Maybe I should've made more of an effort
to draw you out, but I...

266
00:21:49,158 --> 00:21:52,536
I sense you're someone not overly fond
of personal questions.

267
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,539
- And why would that be?
- I don't know.

268
00:21:55,623 --> 00:21:58,793
Just a hunch. Maybe I'm wrong.

269
00:21:58,876 --> 00:22:01,462
- Where are you from?
- Duluth.

270
00:22:01,545 --> 00:22:03,464
Minnesota?

271
00:22:03,547 --> 00:22:04,674
The Art Institute there,

272
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:08,594
they used to have a really lovely
Toulouse-Lautrec, but no more.

273
00:22:08,678 --> 00:22:12,098
When I say Duluth,
I mean a small town south of the city.

274
00:22:12,181 --> 00:22:13,391
Which one?

275
00:22:14,392 --> 00:22:17,395
It's quite small, Mr. Cassidy.
I'm sure you've never heard of it.

276
00:22:17,478 --> 00:22:18,938
Oh, of course not.

277
00:22:19,021 --> 00:22:21,857
Nice to be from a small town though,
isn't it?

278
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:22,984
How so?

279
00:22:23,067 --> 00:22:26,404
Well, you venture into the world
like a newborn,

280
00:22:26,487 --> 00:22:28,656
free to be whomever you choose.

281
00:22:29,991 --> 00:22:34,287
You know, neither of you have mentioned
the empty chair.

282
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:36,247
I assumed that was for your wife.

283
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:39,583
What if I told you that,
at the edge of my property,

284
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:41,752
there's a dilapidated little house,

285
00:22:41,836 --> 00:22:46,299
and in this house there's a man
who I invite for lunch every day,

286
00:22:46,382 --> 00:22:51,679
and the only response I ever get from him
is this empty chair?

287
00:22:51,762 --> 00:22:53,306
Who is it?

288
00:22:53,389 --> 00:22:58,227
This man, my dear young friend,
is the reason that I summoned you here.

289
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:01,856
I don't understand.

290
00:23:01,939 --> 00:23:05,484
Rodolfo, let's have coffee
on the terrace, shall we?

291
00:23:05,568 --> 00:23:06,861
Very well, sir.

292
00:23:13,326 --> 00:23:18,372
If you could interview any living artist,
who do you think it would be?

293
00:23:18,456 --> 00:23:21,125
- Anselm Kiefer.
- Kiefer?

294
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:24,503
Kiefer will speak to anyone
with an open notebook, I think.

295
00:23:24,587 --> 00:23:28,341
No, put yourself
in a bit more rarefied company, okay?

296
00:23:29,425 --> 00:23:34,388
No critic has spoken to this guy
in over 50 years.

297
00:23:34,472 --> 00:23:38,225
It's been that long
since anyone's even seen this man's work.

298
00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:39,518
Still not with you.

299
00:23:39,602 --> 00:23:40,645
Okay.

300
00:23:40,728 --> 00:23:42,271
If I say to you:

301
00:23:42,355 --> 00:23:44,231
Paris, 1968.

302
00:23:44,315 --> 00:23:48,361
Twelve paintings gone up in flames
in a gallery fire.

303
00:23:48,444 --> 00:23:51,072
You're fucking with me.

304
00:23:51,155 --> 00:23:54,283
Two days later,
on the same smoke-stained walls,

305
00:23:54,367 --> 00:23:57,036
an empty picture frame appears.

306
00:23:57,119 --> 00:23:59,872
A little notecard by it, which read:

307
00:23:59,956 --> 00:24:01,999
"Jerome Debney. Number One."

308
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:04,961
Oh, yeah, my college roommate had
a poster of that on her wall.

309
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:07,046
You're really saying Jerome Debney is here?

310
00:24:07,129 --> 00:24:09,131
What was the last you heard of him?

311
00:24:09,215 --> 00:24:12,885
Another fire, about a year ago,
in his studio and house in France.

312
00:24:12,969 --> 00:24:15,888
Everything burned down. He lost everything.

313
00:24:15,972 --> 00:24:18,891
A lifetime's work went up in flames,
and no one ever got to see it.

314
00:24:18,975 --> 00:24:22,270
Gone. As if it never existed.

315
00:24:22,353 --> 00:24:25,481
He is not a wealthy man,
gets all his money from a charitable trust.

316
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:26,816
- The Debney Trust.
- Yeah.

317
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:29,610
Upon whose board I'm very honored to sit.

318
00:24:29,694 --> 00:24:34,115
And in that capacity,
I'm to offer the great man accommodations.

319
00:24:34,198 --> 00:24:35,741
So now every morning,

320
00:24:35,825 --> 00:24:41,038
I got Jerome bloody Debney
sunning himself beside my pool.

321
00:24:42,623 --> 00:24:44,875
- Rodolfo?
- Sir?

322
00:24:44,959 --> 00:24:48,713
What was Mr. Debney reading
when you picked him up the other day?

323
00:24:48,796 --> 00:24:51,257
<i>Flash Art,</i> sir. The March issue.

324
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,926
- Mr. Figueras' column.
- Oh, you're kidding me.

325
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:55,970
And what was he doing
while he was reading it?

326
00:24:56,053 --> 00:24:57,054
Chuckling, sir.

327
00:24:57,138 --> 00:25:00,683
He said, "This young man is quite amusing."

328
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:05,896
Berenice, would you mind if I borrow James
for a little private conversation?

329
00:25:07,023 --> 00:25:08,190
No.

330
00:25:12,153 --> 00:25:17,742
I employ a team of investigators
to ensure authenticity and chain of title.

331
00:25:17,825 --> 00:25:19,201
I see.

332
00:25:19,285 --> 00:25:23,789
One of them came across a recent piece
by you on Modigliani's brushstrokes.

333
00:25:23,873 --> 00:25:26,250
- Do you remember that?
- Yes, of course.

334
00:25:26,334 --> 00:25:28,502
Rather interesting thesis.

335
00:25:28,586 --> 00:25:34,425
Helped me overcome some uncertainty
over a particular Modigliani provenance,

336
00:25:34,508 --> 00:25:36,469
<i>Woman with a Red Scarf.</i>

337
00:25:37,511 --> 00:25:39,972
We made a rather profitable sale
to the Tate.

338
00:25:40,056 --> 00:25:42,183
Oh, it's in the Tate now.

339
00:25:42,266 --> 00:25:45,061
Yeah, it kind of sparked
my curiosity though.

340
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:47,396
So I had my people do a bit more digging.

341
00:25:48,397 --> 00:25:51,400
You were quite the boy wonder,
weren't you, James?

342
00:25:52,401 --> 00:25:54,487
Reading your old articles,

343
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:57,198
one would've thought
you'd be running a museum by now.

344
00:25:57,281 --> 00:25:59,825
- Yeah, well...
- What happened, James?

345
00:26:01,702 --> 00:26:02,870
Embezzlement, right?

346
00:26:03,913 --> 00:26:06,999
Well, that makes it sound
like something it wasn't.

347
00:26:08,042 --> 00:26:09,669
What was it then?

348
00:26:09,752 --> 00:26:13,297
The gallery had an account
for incidental expenses,

349
00:26:13,381 --> 00:26:15,967
and I thought it would be all right to...

350
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:18,719
borrow a small amount and then repay it.

351
00:26:18,803 --> 00:26:21,180
Sounds like something
pretty easy to sort out.

352
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:24,475
I didn't handle that situation very well.

353
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:27,353
I had more of a temper back then.

354
00:26:27,436 --> 00:26:28,854
Oh, did you?

355
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:32,233
Matured with age, have you?

356
00:26:33,609 --> 00:26:35,820
What is this about, Mr. Cassidy?

357
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:38,281
Redemption.

358
00:26:39,282 --> 00:26:41,450
Think of the splash it would make.

359
00:26:42,451 --> 00:26:46,289
The first critic to interview Jerome Debney
in over 50 years,

360
00:26:46,372 --> 00:26:49,709
to see and describe his current work, and...

361
00:26:50,793 --> 00:26:54,797
You know, I could pull quite a few strings,

362
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,383
and you could be running
a major museum soon.

363
00:26:58,384 --> 00:27:01,470
And why would you do this for me?

364
00:27:02,972 --> 00:27:06,100
I'd value a Debney, James,

365
00:27:07,101 --> 00:27:10,771
and I'd like you to procure one for me.

366
00:27:10,855 --> 00:27:12,523
How am I supposed to do that?

367
00:27:12,607 --> 00:27:15,901
Well, that's a transaction
between you and Mr. Debney, isn't it?

368
00:27:15,985 --> 00:27:20,406
Yes, but what's to keep me from doing the
interview without getting you the painting?

369
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:27,872
Did someone pay you
to write that Modigliani article?

370
00:27:28,873 --> 00:27:31,500
A man called Charles Clay?

371
00:27:32,543 --> 00:27:35,296
Charles Clay sold me
<i>Woman with the Red Scarf.</i>

372
00:27:38,966 --> 00:27:42,470
Did you know you were helping
to validate a forgery?

373
00:27:42,553 --> 00:27:44,472
Or were you duped as well?

374
00:27:44,555 --> 00:27:46,349
It's not a forgery.

375
00:27:48,476 --> 00:27:52,688
Anyway, be the end of your fucking career,
wouldn't it?

376
00:27:59,028 --> 00:28:00,613
You sold it to the Tate.

377
00:28:00,696 --> 00:28:05,785
Well, I know, but I rely on the expertise
of scholars in these matters.

378
00:28:07,161 --> 00:28:08,162
Anyway...

379
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:14,126
I'm off to London tomorrow morning, so you
and Berenice can have the run of the place.

380
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:16,671
See what you can manage.

381
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:49,787
Want one?

382
00:28:52,248 --> 00:28:53,791
You got a habit, captain?

383
00:28:53,874 --> 00:28:55,543
Just a little boost now and then.

384
00:28:55,626 --> 00:28:58,296
- How many a day?
- Who's counting?

385
00:28:59,547 --> 00:29:02,800
Where I'm from, that's called a habit.

386
00:29:02,883 --> 00:29:04,844
Duluth, huh?

387
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:09,015
- Thought there was an accent.
- A Duluth accent?

388
00:29:09,098 --> 00:29:11,809
Minnesota. Something weird with the vowels.

389
00:29:12,852 --> 00:29:15,730
I thought all addicts were hapless losers.

390
00:29:15,813 --> 00:29:17,565
Whoa, are we fighting?

391
00:29:17,648 --> 00:29:20,234
- Only if you want to.
- Our first squabble. Okay, bring it on.

392
00:29:20,318 --> 00:29:22,528
- Call me a name.
- Asshole.

393
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:24,822
Put effort into it.

394
00:29:24,905 --> 00:29:26,782
Bastard.

395
00:29:26,866 --> 00:29:30,620
Son of a bitch, piece of shit,
motherfucker, cocksucker.

396
00:29:30,703 --> 00:29:34,665
Say something bad about my character
and make it sting.

397
00:29:34,749 --> 00:29:37,585
You treat serious things
as if they were trivial

398
00:29:37,668 --> 00:29:40,546
and trivial things as if they were serious.

399
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:41,797
Come on.

400
00:29:41,881 --> 00:29:45,760
You have one more go,
then I will show you how it's done.

401
00:29:47,011 --> 00:29:48,596
How many days you think I got left?

402
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:50,806
- Left?
- To live.

403
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:56,520
- I mean, what kind of question is that?
- There's a number, right? For both of us.

404
00:29:56,604 --> 00:29:58,397
Days, hours, minutes.

405
00:29:58,481 --> 00:30:00,900
After this minute right here, one less.

406
00:30:00,983 --> 00:30:04,236
- That's how it works.
- So why waste it like this?

407
00:30:09,033 --> 00:30:11,452
We're friends, right?

408
00:30:11,535 --> 00:30:12,828
The best.

409
00:30:12,912 --> 00:30:15,581
So who gives a fuck where I'm from?

410
00:31:32,533 --> 00:31:34,827
I can mail that for you, ma'am.

411
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:37,663
- If you like.
- Yeah, that'd be great.

412
00:31:40,041 --> 00:31:41,500
Thank you.

413
00:31:43,419 --> 00:31:45,921
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.

414
00:31:46,005 --> 00:31:48,591
Have you got a pen pal, sugarplum?

415
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:50,259
Just my mama.

416
00:31:50,343 --> 00:31:52,386
Back in old Duluth?

417
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:55,014
Had to tell her I met a boy.

418
00:31:58,351 --> 00:32:00,478
Not a word.

419
00:32:02,271 --> 00:32:03,648
Watch.

420
00:32:20,998 --> 00:32:23,417
- Good one.
- Very good one.

421
00:32:23,501 --> 00:32:25,711
Man of many skills.

422
00:32:25,795 --> 00:32:27,463
That's right.

423
00:32:28,714 --> 00:32:31,717
I had the weirdest dream last night.

424
00:32:31,801 --> 00:32:34,428
Weird is how they generally come
in my experience.

425
00:32:34,512 --> 00:32:36,013
I woke up real early.

426
00:32:37,014 --> 00:32:39,392
Heard someone whispering,
so I went to the door,

427
00:32:39,475 --> 00:32:41,310
cracked it open,

428
00:32:41,394 --> 00:32:43,187
and there you were,

429
00:32:43,271 --> 00:32:45,314
down the corridor in a robe with Cassidy,

430
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:49,944
and he gave you an envelope, a thick one.

431
00:32:51,821 --> 00:32:54,657
And here I was thinking flying horses,

432
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,034
sex with your mother, that kind of weird.

433
00:32:57,118 --> 00:32:58,953
I went back to bed and lay there wondering:

434
00:32:59,036 --> 00:33:03,708
"Why would Cassidy give her
an envelope full of cash?"

435
00:33:03,791 --> 00:33:06,460
"Her" being me.

436
00:33:11,674 --> 00:33:14,427
This is a dream we're talking about, right?

437
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,636
Is it?

438
00:33:16,637 --> 00:33:18,806
You're a funny one, aren't you?

439
00:33:32,945 --> 00:33:34,822
Oh, look.

440
00:33:37,325 --> 00:33:40,244
We'll tell our grandchildren about this.

441
00:33:42,371 --> 00:33:45,833
I came here a pauper,
but I'll leave a prince, a fucking emperor.

442
00:33:45,916 --> 00:33:48,210
I saw blue once.

443
00:33:50,671 --> 00:33:53,257
Genuine blue, you understand.

444
00:33:54,258 --> 00:33:56,469
Platonic blue.

445
00:33:57,637 --> 00:34:00,139
In a pool much like this.

446
00:34:01,557 --> 00:34:03,893
I was underwater,

447
00:34:03,976 --> 00:34:06,479
staring upwards at the sky.

448
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:13,361
And perhaps it was merely
a deficit of oxygen.

449
00:34:15,071 --> 00:34:17,073
But for a moment...

450
00:34:18,074 --> 00:34:19,575
blue.

451
00:34:21,701 --> 00:34:25,581
I've been searching for it ever since.

452
00:34:27,708 --> 00:34:29,210
Mr. Figueras,

453
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,754
I thought it might be you.

454
00:34:33,089 --> 00:34:35,383
You've shaved your beard.

455
00:34:35,466 --> 00:34:38,636
You must grow it back. It adds character.

456
00:34:40,513 --> 00:34:42,390
Honored, Mr. Debney.

457
00:34:42,473 --> 00:34:44,475
And startled. How did you...?

458
00:34:44,558 --> 00:34:48,604
Your column, every month,
with its little photo.

459
00:34:48,688 --> 00:34:53,359
Oh, it's a fine thing to see a young man
with such a clear eye.

460
00:34:53,442 --> 00:34:56,654
And your beautiful friend,
you hope to protect her from my charm.

461
00:34:56,737 --> 00:34:59,865
- She has a name, I assume?
- Ms. Berenice Hollis.

462
00:35:02,076 --> 00:35:05,329
Jerome Debney. At your service, Ms. Hollis.

463
00:35:05,413 --> 00:35:07,623
It's an honor, Mr. Debney.

464
00:35:08,624 --> 00:35:09,959
Please.

465
00:35:11,752 --> 00:35:14,588
May I be direct, in the modern way?

466
00:35:14,672 --> 00:35:18,175
Mr. Cassidy has brought us together.
Why, it doesn't matter.

467
00:35:18,259 --> 00:35:20,261
He's a collector.

468
00:35:20,344 --> 00:35:24,432
And collectors, as we both know,
are odd creatures.

469
00:35:24,515 --> 00:35:29,228
I assume an arrangement has been forged,
an agreement that suits you both.

470
00:35:29,312 --> 00:35:31,439
I don't really wish to know, no.

471
00:35:31,522 --> 00:35:33,649
One of the great pleasures
in being an artist

472
00:35:33,733 --> 00:35:37,778
is that one need not traffic with the world
in this fashion.

473
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:42,366
I presume that you would like an interview.

474
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:45,411
Tape recorder spinning away.

475
00:35:46,662 --> 00:35:48,706
I cannot abide such things.

476
00:35:49,874 --> 00:35:51,375
A conversation?

477
00:35:51,459 --> 00:35:54,587
Natural, informal.

478
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:58,174
This, perhaps, might be possible.
Nothing more.

479
00:35:58,257 --> 00:36:00,593
Would such an approach assuage you?

480
00:36:00,676 --> 00:36:02,637
That would mean the world to me.

481
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,765
The holy grail. Be the greatest honor.

482
00:36:05,848 --> 00:36:08,392
But should it come so easily?

483
00:36:09,393 --> 00:36:10,603
Excuse me?

484
00:36:10,686 --> 00:36:12,188
What have you suffered?

485
00:36:12,271 --> 00:36:14,774
The king invites you to his palace.

486
00:36:14,857 --> 00:36:17,526
You sun yourselves by its pool.

487
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:20,363
The grail approaches and presents itself.

488
00:36:20,446 --> 00:36:23,366
No battles, no trials.

489
00:36:23,449 --> 00:36:25,368
The gods would never approve.

490
00:36:25,451 --> 00:36:28,371
Mr. Debney, it was merely a metaphor.

491
00:36:28,454 --> 00:36:30,498
What power lurks in metaphors.

492
00:36:30,581 --> 00:36:32,917
- Are you a swimmer?
- I think...

493
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,921
One length, underwater,
and I'll speak with you.

494
00:36:37,004 --> 00:36:39,256
- But, Mr. Debney, I...
- Two lengths.

495
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:43,678
If your next word is anything but "yes,"
it'll be four lengths.

496
00:36:45,554 --> 00:36:47,181
Very well.

497
00:36:49,392 --> 00:36:52,436
My mother taught me how to haggle.

498
00:36:53,729 --> 00:36:56,816
If you have nothing to lose,
you must be merciless.

499
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,151
Come.

500
00:36:59,235 --> 00:37:02,405
Sit beside me
and we'll cheer him on together.

501
00:37:04,615 --> 00:37:07,743
I didn't expect you to be so sociable,
Mr. Debney.

502
00:37:07,827 --> 00:37:12,290
One of the things I've learned
in my long stay upon this darkling plane,

503
00:37:12,373 --> 00:37:14,458
most things, most people,

504
00:37:14,542 --> 00:37:16,961
they are not what you'd expect.

505
00:37:21,257 --> 00:37:23,634
Are you what one might expect?

506
00:37:24,635 --> 00:37:26,387
What might that be?

507
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:27,513
A stone.

508
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:30,599
Perhaps an egg.

509
00:37:32,018 --> 00:37:33,686
The question being,

510
00:37:33,769 --> 00:37:36,647
how deep the hardness goes.

511
00:37:36,731 --> 00:37:40,151
We'd need to drop you to know for certain.

512
00:37:40,234 --> 00:37:42,403
Bravo! Halfway!

513
00:37:43,863 --> 00:37:46,407
- You're old friends?
- Freshly minted.

514
00:37:47,408 --> 00:37:49,577
He is an ambitious young man.

515
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:52,246
So if you are an egg,

516
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:54,040
I hope you'll be careful.

517
00:37:54,123 --> 00:37:56,042
Trust me, I'm anything but an egg.

518
00:37:56,125 --> 00:37:58,919
Do you know the saddest egg of all?

519
00:37:59,003 --> 00:38:01,464
The egg that believes it's a stone.

520
00:38:03,341 --> 00:38:07,053
Is there anything I might say
that could dissuade you

521
00:38:07,136 --> 00:38:10,264
from writing about me in your magazine?

522
00:38:12,892 --> 00:38:15,227
I suspected as much.

523
00:38:15,311 --> 00:38:19,607
I go now where you are not welcome
to my studio for three hours.

524
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:24,111
After that, a boat ride, and you're welcome
to accompany me if you wish.

525
00:38:24,195 --> 00:38:26,614
After the boat ride, a shower

526
00:38:26,697 --> 00:38:28,574
and then dinner.

527
00:38:28,658 --> 00:38:30,576
For which you are also welcome.

528
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:34,121
The meal, not the shower.

529
00:38:34,205 --> 00:38:35,331
Is that acceptable?

530
00:38:41,087 --> 00:38:43,255
Such sweet sorrow.

531
00:38:49,512 --> 00:38:52,473
Did you find my blue under there?

532
00:38:55,309 --> 00:38:56,769
You okay, champ?

533
00:39:12,535 --> 00:39:15,037
How did you end up with such a pretty name?

534
00:39:16,038 --> 00:39:17,915
Waiting for me when I arrived.

535
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,794
Doesn't strike me
as a common choice in Minnesota.

536
00:39:21,877 --> 00:39:24,797
- We gonna dance to this tune again?
- Tell me.

537
00:39:25,965 --> 00:39:29,343
My mother bet my Aunt Sally
that I'd be a girl.

538
00:39:29,427 --> 00:39:31,887
Which I am, as you maybe noticed.

539
00:39:31,971 --> 00:39:35,349
So "Berenice," bringer of victory.

540
00:39:35,433 --> 00:39:37,602
What did they bet?

541
00:39:37,685 --> 00:39:40,730
- A new set of pickling jars.
- Oh, you're good.

542
00:39:40,813 --> 00:39:43,691
Lying's easy when you tell the truth.

543
00:39:45,026 --> 00:39:47,987
It's the quirky details that carry the day.

544
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,989
Aunt Sally, pickling jars.

545
00:39:50,072 --> 00:39:54,619
Nils vowing never to touch a brush again,
Nora dying of consumption.

546
00:39:55,703 --> 00:39:59,915
Want to know about Nora? Ask Debney.
He probably met her in Paris.

547
00:40:01,626 --> 00:40:04,003
Almost time for our boat ride.

548
00:40:06,213 --> 00:40:08,007
You're on your own for that.

549
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:10,593
If I don't rest, I can't make dinner.

550
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:14,680
What?

551
00:40:16,974 --> 00:40:19,185
We're not supposed to talk about it.
That's the deal?

552
00:40:19,268 --> 00:40:22,730
It's not so complicated, honeybunch.
I had a deadline, the pills helped.

553
00:40:22,813 --> 00:40:26,233
Then I started needing more,
then it wasn't about the deadlines anymore.

554
00:40:26,317 --> 00:40:27,693
I can end it. I just...

555
00:40:27,777 --> 00:40:30,029
I'm just waiting for the right moment.

556
00:40:30,112 --> 00:40:34,325
And I can certainly hear how that sounds,
and it's not like that.

557
00:40:38,913 --> 00:40:39,747
Yeah.

558
00:40:40,748 --> 00:40:43,834
You're probably right.
We shouldn't talk about it.

559
00:41:00,393 --> 00:41:01,894
Where is our Galahad?

560
00:41:01,978 --> 00:41:04,855
Resting. He sends his regrets.

561
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,944
I wore him out, didn't I?
With our little escapade.

562
00:41:10,027 --> 00:41:11,279
Where are you taking me?

563
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:16,367
<i>Come away, O human child!
To the waters and the wild</i>

564
00:42:32,485 --> 00:42:35,404
Did you know a woman named Nora Ingen?

565
00:42:39,033 --> 00:42:40,743
Nora.

566
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:46,874
The beautiful and broken Nora.

567
00:42:50,586 --> 00:42:52,129
What do you know of her?

568
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:55,091
Only what James told me.

569
00:42:56,092 --> 00:43:00,012
The concentration camps,
her brother painting the Germans,

570
00:43:00,096 --> 00:43:01,514
the flies.

571
00:43:01,597 --> 00:43:02,723
Flies?

572
00:43:05,476 --> 00:43:07,270
A fairy tale.

573
00:43:07,353 --> 00:43:12,024
- To give meaning where there was none.
- It's not true?

574
00:43:12,108 --> 00:43:15,361
The camps were not a place
where paintings were made.

575
00:43:15,444 --> 00:43:19,782
The idea of such a thing, it's obscene.

576
00:43:21,534 --> 00:43:23,619
Nils died like all the others.

577
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:26,580
Packed into a narrow room.

578
00:43:27,581 --> 00:43:28,791
Gassed.

579
00:43:28,874 --> 00:43:30,543
How do you know?

580
00:43:32,336 --> 00:43:34,422
- She told me.
- Nora?

581
00:43:35,423 --> 00:43:38,759
We were not very good to her,
the men in my circle.

582
00:43:38,843 --> 00:43:41,846
We passed her around like a talisman,

583
00:43:41,929 --> 00:43:47,893
daring ourselves to kiss
the tiny numbers tattooed on her forearm.

584
00:43:49,228 --> 00:43:51,230
We were callow

585
00:43:51,314 --> 00:43:53,649
when we should've been kind.

586
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:59,196
Now you know the worst of Jerome Debney.

587
00:44:00,406 --> 00:44:02,283
We're still friends?

588
00:44:02,366 --> 00:44:04,493
Of course, Mr. Debney.

589
00:44:04,577 --> 00:44:07,538
- We'll always be friends.
- Oh, wonderful.

590
00:44:07,622 --> 00:44:09,248
Wonderful.

591
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:55,438
A favorite spot of mine.

592
00:45:55,521 --> 00:45:58,274
One must labor to apprehend it.

593
00:45:58,357 --> 00:46:00,943
And those surely don't help.

594
00:46:02,403 --> 00:46:06,115
I try to think of them as regrets.

595
00:46:06,198 --> 00:46:09,327
One can either feel tormented

596
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:11,829
or learn to endure their presence.

597
00:46:11,912 --> 00:46:15,291
I obviously carry mine
less gracefully than you.

598
00:46:15,374 --> 00:46:17,710
Well, then you must tell me a secret.

599
00:46:17,793 --> 00:46:21,922
Something shameful.
It will ease your burden.

600
00:46:25,343 --> 00:46:26,844
I'm a teacher.

601
00:46:26,927 --> 00:46:29,472
And a fine one, I'm sure.

602
00:46:29,555 --> 00:46:31,932
- I made a mistake.
- What sort?

603
00:46:32,016 --> 00:46:34,268
An indiscretion with a colleague.

604
00:46:34,352 --> 00:46:35,436
Married, I assume?

605
00:46:39,315 --> 00:46:42,526
Every year, I have the freshmen girls
for health.

606
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:45,780
The facts of life, that kind of thing.

607
00:46:45,863 --> 00:46:47,615
How not to get pregnant.

608
00:46:48,616 --> 00:46:52,119
The teacher was not such a good student?

609
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:57,333
Officially, I'm on leave
to have a cyst removed.

610
00:46:58,834 --> 00:47:00,419
I have a friend, a best friend.

611
00:47:00,503 --> 00:47:02,672
She's older, married.

612
00:47:03,673 --> 00:47:04,966
Before I left, I told her everything,

613
00:47:05,049 --> 00:47:08,052
and there was this moment
when I was talking,

614
00:47:08,135 --> 00:47:10,262
and she gave me this look...

615
00:47:10,346 --> 00:47:12,682
It was just a flash, you know, reflexive.

616
00:47:12,765 --> 00:47:14,934
...like she wanted to spit on me.

617
00:47:15,935 --> 00:47:18,521
It stung. Keeps stinging.

618
00:47:19,522 --> 00:47:22,858
So when I got to Italy, I thought, "Why not?

619
00:47:22,942 --> 00:47:26,028
Play the whore for a little while.

620
00:47:26,112 --> 00:47:27,446
See how it feels."

621
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:29,323
And does it suit you?

622
00:47:29,407 --> 00:47:30,449
This new mask?

623
00:47:32,702 --> 00:47:34,537
Turns out, I'm all right at it.

624
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:37,039
You have to be careful, my dear.

625
00:47:37,123 --> 00:47:39,208
A mask can be a perilous thing.

626
00:47:39,292 --> 00:47:42,628
When I take mine off at night,
another waits beneath.

627
00:47:42,712 --> 00:47:44,255
And under that?

628
00:47:45,589 --> 00:47:47,591
So many years, Ms. Hollis.

629
00:47:48,592 --> 00:47:50,136
Decades.

630
00:47:50,219 --> 00:47:54,765
And it's masks all the way down by now.

631
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:00,896
And you?

632
00:48:02,231 --> 00:48:04,483
Is there anything left?

633
00:48:08,404 --> 00:48:10,031
I think so.

634
00:48:10,114 --> 00:48:12,074
Then it's not too late, is it?

635
00:50:26,626 --> 00:50:28,294
James?

636
00:50:33,007 --> 00:50:35,384
Sky's still standing, Chicken Little.

637
00:50:35,468 --> 00:50:37,094
Just slipped on the stairs.

638
00:50:38,095 --> 00:50:40,931
Tell Papa all about the boat ride.

639
00:50:41,932 --> 00:50:44,810
I think I lost 3 pounds to mosquitoes.

640
00:50:45,811 --> 00:50:48,648
But I like him. He's a fine old man.

641
00:50:48,731 --> 00:50:51,734
- What did you two lovebirds talk about?
- This and that.

642
00:50:51,817 --> 00:50:55,446
- Not the other thing?
- Never on a first date.

643
00:50:55,529 --> 00:50:57,865
What kind of girl you take me for?

644
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:01,327
Seemed to think I should tell you the truth.

645
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:03,579
- About what?
- Myself.

646
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:06,624
And what would that be?

647
00:51:06,707 --> 00:51:09,251
Small-town girl, made a mistake.

648
00:51:09,335 --> 00:51:13,005
In way over her head,
paddling about with sharks like you.

649
00:51:14,006 --> 00:51:16,592
- Little Bo-Peep, huh?
- Pretty much.

650
00:51:17,593 --> 00:51:20,096
Tell it to Aunt Sally.

651
00:51:33,067 --> 00:51:35,152
Aren't you the little lady?

652
00:51:35,236 --> 00:51:37,363
Bit late for that, turns out.

653
00:51:37,446 --> 00:51:39,365
Did I miss any local sights?

654
00:51:39,448 --> 00:51:41,450
He took me to some ruins.

655
00:51:41,534 --> 00:51:44,328
- Just up the lake?
- Just outside the property.

656
00:51:44,412 --> 00:51:47,164
Felt like the first person to set foot there
in a hundred years.

657
00:51:47,248 --> 00:51:50,334
It scares me to think of him
out there alone, though, on the water.

658
00:51:50,418 --> 00:51:52,003
Why?

659
00:51:53,629 --> 00:51:55,840
He capsizes, no one will ever find him.

660
00:51:55,923 --> 00:51:58,342
Probably what he wants,
vanish without a trace.

661
00:51:58,426 --> 00:52:00,303
Be the perfect close to his legend.

662
00:52:00,386 --> 00:52:03,597
Nobody wants to end up
at the bottom of a lake, chief.

663
00:52:10,313 --> 00:52:11,522
Thank you.

664
00:52:11,606 --> 00:52:12,940
Do me a favor?

665
00:52:13,024 --> 00:52:14,400
What are friends for?

666
00:52:14,483 --> 00:52:18,988
Tonight, when we're at his house, I need
to take a photo of whatever he's working on.

667
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:22,033
- Can you distract him a bit, please?
- Why?

668
00:52:22,116 --> 00:52:24,994
- There's no way he's ever gonna...
- Why do you need to take a picture?

669
00:52:25,077 --> 00:52:28,164
For my work, for my writing, reference.

670
00:52:28,247 --> 00:52:31,042
Seems kind of underhanded, don't you think?

671
00:52:31,125 --> 00:52:33,127
Underhanded?

672
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:34,920
He's inviting us into his home.

673
00:52:35,004 --> 00:52:38,841
It's a memory aid, Pollyanna.
I'll delete it when I'm done.

674
00:52:39,842 --> 00:52:42,595
What makes you think
he's gonna show you anything anyway?

675
00:52:43,596 --> 00:52:46,515
My irresistible charisma.

676
00:52:47,642 --> 00:52:49,685
<i>No, Mr. Figueras.</i>

677
00:52:49,769 --> 00:52:52,104
No, no, no.

678
00:52:52,188 --> 00:52:53,731
It's a ridicule.

679
00:52:53,814 --> 00:52:56,901
Why ruin a pleasant evening?

680
00:52:56,984 --> 00:52:59,278
Let us finish our meal.

681
00:52:59,362 --> 00:53:02,406
I'll pretend you never raised the idea,

682
00:53:02,490 --> 00:53:03,991
and we'll all part as friends.

683
00:53:04,075 --> 00:53:06,869
You have a duty, Mr. Debney.

684
00:53:06,953 --> 00:53:09,246
- To whom?
- Posterity.

685
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:12,541
When you've departed,
the world will come rushing in.

686
00:53:12,625 --> 00:53:15,586
Wouldn't it be better
to share your work now, with me,

687
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:17,546
while you're still here to explain it?

688
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:20,591
I can help you do this. Together, we...

689
00:53:21,592 --> 00:53:24,595
What is the earliest example of art
you can think of?

690
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,765
The caves, I suppose. Lascaux, Altamira.

691
00:53:29,392 --> 00:53:32,186
Odd place to paint, wouldn't you agree?

692
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:33,896
A hole in the ground?

693
00:53:34,897 --> 00:53:37,233
Can you explain the impulse?

694
00:53:37,316 --> 00:53:39,360
Well, it's a long way
from my field of expertise,

695
00:53:39,443 --> 00:53:42,446
but I suppose there's
some sort of ritualized element here.

696
00:53:42,530 --> 00:53:46,659
I mean, the womb, Mother Earth,
a descent into...

697
00:53:46,742 --> 00:53:49,120
I have a much simpler hypothesis.

698
00:53:49,203 --> 00:53:52,081
They had no desire to share their work.

699
00:53:52,164 --> 00:53:55,876
They were hiding it
from eyes they considered unworthy.

700
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:58,421
But I suppose you could also say
it was a way

701
00:53:58,504 --> 00:54:02,008
of safeguarding the paintings
for future generations.

702
00:54:03,009 --> 00:54:06,721
After all, their work was discovered,
just as yours shall be.

703
00:54:06,804 --> 00:54:11,809
And I'll be there to write of it,
Mr. Debney, with you or without you.

704
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:22,737
He's such an earnest young man.

705
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:27,617
To speak so seriously
of such foolish matters.

706
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:30,620
Oh, nothing could be less foolish.

707
00:54:31,621 --> 00:54:34,707
Come. Let me show you my studio.

708
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:36,709
Are you serious?

709
00:54:36,792 --> 00:54:38,502
I think you'll be quite amused.

710
00:54:38,586 --> 00:54:41,047
- Both of us?
- Everyone.

711
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:42,715
It's time.

712
00:54:42,798 --> 00:54:44,258
Past time.

713
00:54:45,259 --> 00:54:46,385
- Take this.
- What?

714
00:54:46,469 --> 00:54:48,304
When I give you the nod, drop it.

715
00:54:48,387 --> 00:54:50,306
- What...?
- Trust me.

716
00:54:52,141 --> 00:54:55,144
We have to be rather fleet of foot,
I'm afraid.

717
00:54:55,227 --> 00:54:58,439
I have a rendezvous this evening.
With a local widow.

718
00:54:58,522 --> 00:55:01,025
And I can write about this,
what you show us?

719
00:55:01,108 --> 00:55:02,360
You have my blessing.

720
00:55:02,443 --> 00:55:06,572
Indeed, I'll be rather intrigued
to learn what you make of it.

721
00:55:06,656 --> 00:55:09,241
This is everything, you understand.

722
00:55:09,325 --> 00:55:11,869
Nothing else exists.

723
00:55:27,927 --> 00:55:31,931
This one has been quite tricky.
I'd value your insight.

724
00:55:33,099 --> 00:55:35,059
Too much blue?

725
00:55:36,352 --> 00:55:39,438
- I don't understand.
- Those are finished.

726
00:55:39,522 --> 00:55:40,940
More or less.

727
00:55:41,023 --> 00:55:44,443
Though if the muse calls, I return.

728
00:55:46,946 --> 00:55:49,198
But, Mr. Debney, there's nothing here.

729
00:55:49,282 --> 00:55:50,741
No?

730
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,625
The blue.

731
00:56:00,626 --> 00:56:02,378
I keep thinking too much.

732
00:56:03,421 --> 00:56:05,589
Mr. Debney, I...

733
00:56:07,091 --> 00:56:10,219
You know of the fire, the first,
at the gallery in Paris?

734
00:56:10,303 --> 00:56:11,762
Yes, of course.

735
00:56:12,888 --> 00:56:17,101
For three weeks,
the world picked up Jerome Debney,

736
00:56:17,184 --> 00:56:20,438
turned him this way and that,
covered him with words.

737
00:56:21,897 --> 00:56:25,484
I'll be honest,
I thought I was quite the success.

738
00:56:25,568 --> 00:56:29,405
- A genius, even.
- You were. Are.

739
00:56:30,489 --> 00:56:34,535
A carelessly discarded cigarette.

740
00:56:34,619 --> 00:56:35,911
In less than an hour...

741
00:56:36,912 --> 00:56:38,331
nothing.

742
00:56:38,414 --> 00:56:41,417
You would've thought I'd lost a loved one,
how I was treated.

743
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:45,504
Letters of condolence, mournful embraces.

744
00:56:46,505 --> 00:56:49,300
And yet, in my heart...

745
00:56:50,301 --> 00:56:52,094
a great burden lifted.

746
00:56:53,095 --> 00:56:56,932
All those words, all those opinions,

747
00:56:57,016 --> 00:56:59,810
that was the meaning of the empty frame.

748
00:56:59,894 --> 00:57:01,270
It was a joke.

749
00:57:01,354 --> 00:57:04,023
Fill this with your chatter.

750
00:57:04,106 --> 00:57:06,317
And look how they did with it.

751
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,528
- I've seen it on a T-shirt.
- Yeah.

752
00:57:09,612 --> 00:57:11,656
From then on in,

753
00:57:11,739 --> 00:57:14,075
there was no one who could make my work

754
00:57:14,158 --> 00:57:16,494
anything other than what it was.

755
00:57:17,495 --> 00:57:20,039
It was Eden, Mr. Figueras.

756
00:57:20,122 --> 00:57:22,291
For nearly 50 years,

757
00:57:22,375 --> 00:57:25,169
I walked naked in the garden.

758
00:57:25,252 --> 00:57:26,712
And then one morning,

759
00:57:27,713 --> 00:57:29,298
I woke with a pain.

760
00:57:30,299 --> 00:57:31,592
Here.

761
00:57:32,593 --> 00:57:34,136
It was nothing.

762
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:36,347
Indigestion.

763
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:39,433
But it reminded me of the serpent.

764
00:57:39,517 --> 00:57:42,103
The serpent that lurks in all our gardens.

765
00:57:43,145 --> 00:57:46,440
One day, Jerome Debney...

766
00:57:46,524 --> 00:57:48,609
will be no more.

767
00:57:49,610 --> 00:57:52,822
And the world, as you so astutely put it,

768
00:57:52,905 --> 00:57:54,573
will come rushing in.

769
00:57:55,574 --> 00:57:57,159
You burned the villa.

770
00:57:58,202 --> 00:58:00,955
I wish you could've seen the colors,
my dear.

771
00:58:01,998 --> 00:58:04,792
The flames feeding on the paint.

772
00:58:04,875 --> 00:58:06,711
It was quite lovely, I assure you.

773
00:58:06,794 --> 00:58:09,547
Jesus fucking Christ.

774
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:10,673
Now...

775
00:58:12,091 --> 00:58:13,134
every morning...

776
00:58:14,135 --> 00:58:18,139
I take the palette, the brush,

777
00:58:18,222 --> 00:58:19,682
and I paint.

778
00:58:20,683 --> 00:58:22,435
Without the paint.

779
00:58:23,436 --> 00:58:26,731
I have become my own cave.

780
00:58:26,814 --> 00:58:29,900
A deep breath, young man, it will pass.

781
00:58:29,984 --> 00:58:31,068
You're a thief.

782
00:58:32,194 --> 00:58:35,781
Your work belongs to the world,
the entire fucking world,

783
00:58:35,865 --> 00:58:37,992
and you've stolen it.

784
00:58:38,075 --> 00:58:39,660
It's despicable.

785
00:58:41,203 --> 00:58:42,788
I think somehow you might be right.

786
00:58:44,165 --> 00:58:47,918
The blue, it does seem a little off somehow.

787
00:58:49,295 --> 00:58:51,714
- Along the bottom, no?
- Right.

788
00:58:51,797 --> 00:58:54,216
You have an excellent eye.

789
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,469
There's writing on the back.

790
00:58:56,552 --> 00:58:58,262
When I'm truly finished,

791
00:58:58,346 --> 00:59:02,558
I scrawl the title,
the date and my initials.

792
00:59:02,642 --> 00:59:04,560
For posterity's sake, you understand.

793
00:59:04,644 --> 00:59:06,771
<i>"The Burnt Orange Heresy."</i>

794
00:59:06,854 --> 00:59:09,106
- A favorite.
- What does it mean?

795
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:13,069
It's a bone tossed to the critics,
those ravenous dogs.

796
00:59:13,152 --> 00:59:15,655
They can wear themselves out chewing on it.

797
00:59:15,738 --> 00:59:17,949
Searching for meaning where there is none.

798
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:22,662
I'll wait outside.
I'm sorry, sir, but I... I...

799
00:59:22,745 --> 00:59:24,330
I lack the stomach for this.

800
00:59:25,498 --> 00:59:27,208
James.

801
00:59:27,291 --> 00:59:31,295
Leave him. He has wounds to lick.

802
00:59:59,156 --> 01:00:02,827
I'm afraid I must part ways
with you here, my dear.

803
01:00:03,828 --> 01:00:06,080
If I tarry much longer,

804
01:00:06,163 --> 01:00:08,749
the widow will have gone to sleep.

805
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:12,253
I wish you much happiness, my dear,

806
01:00:12,336 --> 01:00:14,588
and a long life in which to enjoy it.

807
01:00:15,631 --> 01:00:19,760
It's been an honor
and an even greater pleasure.

808
01:00:20,761 --> 01:00:23,889
I know you're an unhappy young man
right now.

809
01:00:23,973 --> 01:00:27,518
But I believe in time, you will understand.

810
01:00:27,602 --> 01:00:29,020
Yeah.

811
01:00:32,189 --> 01:00:33,274
Good night.

812
01:01:07,975 --> 01:01:09,727
Still friends, partner?

813
01:01:10,728 --> 01:01:12,813
Hey, I'm sorry, but that was a shock.

814
01:01:12,897 --> 01:01:16,067
Got your scoop, didn't you?
It's not the one you thought.

815
01:01:17,068 --> 01:01:18,194
Fuck.

816
01:01:18,277 --> 01:01:20,196
- What?
- I forgot my bag.

817
01:01:20,279 --> 01:01:22,406
- Oh, I'll come with you.
- No, no, no. Wait.

818
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:24,408
Go pack and meet me by the car.

819
01:01:24,492 --> 01:01:25,493
The car?

820
01:01:25,576 --> 01:01:28,371
Listen, I need to write this now,
and I can't do that here, so...

821
01:01:28,454 --> 01:01:32,124
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I am serious. Please, do it.

822
01:01:32,208 --> 01:01:34,126
Promise, I'll make it up to you.

823
01:01:34,210 --> 01:01:35,252
Okay?

824
01:05:38,829 --> 01:05:39,664
What?

825
01:05:40,665 --> 01:05:43,459
Hey, train's leaving. Get on it. Come on.

826
01:06:31,632 --> 01:06:35,678
Embers, ashes, afterglow.

827
01:06:36,721 --> 01:06:41,225
Into the good night. Into the gentle night.

828
01:06:41,309 --> 01:06:45,021
Debney. Embers, ashes, acceptance.

829
01:06:45,104 --> 01:06:47,857
Demurral and acceptance.

830
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:53,195
Debney. Demurral and acceptance.

831
01:06:54,238 --> 01:06:56,866
Acting a little strange, boss.

832
01:06:57,867 --> 01:06:59,410
How long have you known me?

833
01:07:00,411 --> 01:07:02,246
A few days.

834
01:07:03,456 --> 01:07:09,879
So how can you possibly say
what's strange and what's normal?

835
01:07:20,348 --> 01:07:22,350
Home sweet home.

836
01:08:32,003 --> 01:08:34,838
- Where are you going?
- Gotta get writing.

837
01:08:34,922 --> 01:08:35,756
Now?

838
01:08:36,757 --> 01:08:38,426
Well, when the muse calls...

839
01:08:39,552 --> 01:08:41,262
Come on, be a good girl.

840
01:11:27,970 --> 01:11:29,096
Mr. Cassidy.

841
01:11:30,097 --> 01:11:32,183
<i>It seems there's been a fire
on my estate, James.</i>

842
01:11:32,266 --> 01:11:34,352
Yes. Yes, sir. That... That's right.

843
01:11:34,435 --> 01:11:37,188
- That is right.
- <i>Debney's studio?</i>

844
01:11:38,189 --> 01:11:40,191
Yes. Yes, I'm afraid so.

845
01:11:40,274 --> 01:11:45,363
Will you please assure me that this happened
after you procured the painting?

846
01:11:45,446 --> 01:11:47,156
It did. It did.

847
01:11:47,239 --> 01:11:51,994
So my painting is the only Debney
in existence, then. Right?

848
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:56,040
Yes, I suppose
you could say that, sir, yeah.

849
01:11:56,123 --> 01:11:58,292
<i>And Debney, he's...?</i>

850
01:11:58,376 --> 01:12:00,169
He was away for the evening.

851
01:12:00,252 --> 01:12:03,214
I mean, how much more
can he really paint? I mean, he's old.

852
01:12:03,297 --> 01:12:06,842
- He is old.
- <i>Oh, send me a text of it, can you?</i>

853
01:12:07,969 --> 01:12:09,845
No, no, no. I can't do that. It's in my car.

854
01:12:09,929 --> 01:12:14,100
It's hidden, and I can't risk taking it out.
Ms. Hollis is still with me.

855
01:12:15,101 --> 01:12:17,937
<i>Well, can you describe it to me, then?</i>

856
01:12:22,316 --> 01:12:26,237
Well, it's... It's kind of hard to describe,
to be honest.

857
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:29,907
<i>Well, it's your bloody job
describing pictures, isn't it?</i>

858
01:12:35,329 --> 01:12:36,872
<i>James?</i>

859
01:12:38,499 --> 01:12:42,086
It's called <i>The Burnt Orange Heresy.</i>

860
01:12:43,129 --> 01:12:44,130
It's orange?

861
01:12:44,213 --> 01:12:45,965
<i>It's burnt orange.</i>

862
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:48,968
Like the sun.

863
01:12:50,219 --> 01:12:52,430
Like the setting sun.

864
01:12:53,848 --> 01:12:56,642
It's a self-portrait, really. It is.

865
01:12:56,726 --> 01:12:58,102
It's...

866
01:12:58,185 --> 01:13:02,231
<i>the artist, alone in the empyrean,</i>

867
01:13:02,315 --> 01:13:05,985
<i>descending toward a final horizon.</i>

868
01:13:08,404 --> 01:13:10,781
<i>In full acceptance.</i>

869
01:13:12,241 --> 01:13:15,870
<i>That's fantastic, James. Fantastic.</i>

870
01:13:17,246 --> 01:13:18,748
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

871
01:13:20,458 --> 01:13:22,084
<i>Thank you.</i>

872
01:14:36,784 --> 01:14:39,036
Tell me why this isn't a terrible thing.

873
01:14:40,037 --> 01:14:42,873
- It's not what it looks like.
- What does it look like?

874
01:14:43,874 --> 01:14:45,376
What does it look like, James?

875
01:14:45,459 --> 01:14:47,837
Listen to me for a second.

876
01:14:48,838 --> 01:14:52,425
That lecture for those tourists, right?

877
01:14:52,508 --> 01:14:56,637
I do that 20, 30 times a year,
200 euros a pop,

878
01:14:56,721 --> 01:14:58,139
in Milan or Florence or Rome,

879
01:14:58,222 --> 01:15:00,391
and it's the same blank-faced
American tourists

880
01:15:00,474 --> 01:15:03,686
with the same stupid fucking questions
every time about Raphael and da Vinci,

881
01:15:03,769 --> 01:15:06,647
as if no one else ever painted anything.

882
01:15:06,731 --> 01:15:11,068
Debney is stealing from me. Yes, he is.
And from you and from everybody.

883
01:15:11,152 --> 01:15:12,862
This isn't who you are, slick.

884
01:15:12,945 --> 01:15:17,366
Pumpkin, you haven't
the slightest idea who I am.

885
01:15:18,701 --> 01:15:20,411
You know what we need to do.

886
01:15:20,494 --> 01:15:22,079
What?

887
01:15:22,163 --> 01:15:23,998
We need to get rid of that awful painting.

888
01:15:24,081 --> 01:15:26,417
- No. Don't you dare.
- Let go, James.

889
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:28,210
- Don't you dare.
- You're hurting me!

890
01:15:28,294 --> 01:15:32,256
Have you any idea how valuable that is?
That's the only Debney in the world.

891
01:15:33,257 --> 01:15:35,134
Why is he paying you?

892
01:15:35,217 --> 01:15:36,552
Who?

893
01:15:36,636 --> 01:15:39,472
- Cassidy. To spy on me?
- That was a dream.

894
01:15:39,555 --> 01:15:42,350
- You said that was a dream.
- Please go tell him. Tell him.

895
01:15:43,351 --> 01:15:47,355
He won't believe you because
he wants it to be real. And it is real.

896
01:15:47,438 --> 01:15:49,607
Do you know what's gonna happen now?

897
01:15:49,690 --> 01:15:52,193
You're gonna get out of my apartment.

898
01:15:52,276 --> 01:15:54,111
You're gonna get out of my life and go back

899
01:15:54,195 --> 01:15:56,697
to your cheap whoring
and sucking and fucking your...

900
01:15:56,781 --> 01:15:59,200
- We're through here.
- Motherfucker!

901
01:16:30,940 --> 01:16:32,441
Fuck.

902
01:18:24,637 --> 01:18:26,055
No, no, no. Come on.

903
01:18:26,138 --> 01:18:27,807
Easy.

904
01:18:28,808 --> 01:18:30,226
Easy.

905
01:18:34,605 --> 01:18:36,399
No, no, no.

906
01:18:43,030 --> 01:18:44,865
I'm really, really sorry.

907
01:18:46,325 --> 01:18:48,703
It was an accident, okay?

908
01:18:50,663 --> 01:18:52,123
You...

909
01:18:53,457 --> 01:18:55,501
You scared me.

910
01:18:57,503 --> 01:18:59,880
I know. I'm sorry.

911
01:19:01,090 --> 01:19:03,175
You hurt me.

912
01:19:04,218 --> 01:19:05,928
I didn't mean to.

913
01:19:06,929 --> 01:19:10,766
It was an accident, okay? It's over.

914
01:19:12,059 --> 01:19:14,937
Okay? It's over.

915
01:19:19,025 --> 01:19:21,277
I'm so, so sorry.

916
01:19:28,951 --> 01:19:30,703
Can you stand up?

917
01:19:32,288 --> 01:19:34,540
Get you back to the apartment.

918
01:19:35,541 --> 01:19:37,084
Okay?

919
01:19:40,379 --> 01:19:42,173
Give me your hand.

920
01:19:49,472 --> 01:19:51,432
I'm so, so sorry.

921
01:19:52,433 --> 01:19:54,060
Come here.

922
01:19:55,895 --> 01:19:57,104
We're okay?

923
01:19:58,105 --> 01:19:59,607
Come on.

924
01:19:59,690 --> 01:20:01,233
You can do this.

925
01:20:01,317 --> 01:20:03,069
It's gonna be fine.

926
01:20:13,579 --> 01:20:15,331
I'm sorry.

927
01:20:16,540 --> 01:20:19,877
You do know that, right? How sorry I am.

928
01:20:22,797 --> 01:20:25,091
I could buy you a plane ticket.

929
01:20:26,342 --> 01:20:27,885
How will that sound?

930
01:20:28,886 --> 01:20:31,597
First class, anywhere you want to go.

931
01:20:31,681 --> 01:20:35,476
He's paying you. Cassidy.

932
01:20:35,559 --> 01:20:40,731
Oh, no. No, no, no, it's not like that.
He's letting me write about it.

933
01:20:41,899 --> 01:20:46,153
It's actually the opportunity of a lifetime,
to take a Debney, to be allowed...

934
01:20:46,237 --> 01:20:48,239
It's not real, James.

935
01:20:51,659 --> 01:20:54,370
It is so real.

936
01:21:00,918 --> 01:21:02,878
Please get dressed.

937
01:21:03,879 --> 01:21:06,257
You can't even see it, can you?

938
01:21:07,258 --> 01:21:08,426
I can help you.

939
01:21:08,509 --> 01:21:10,177
We're wasting time.

940
01:21:10,261 --> 01:21:12,305
Will you let me help you?

941
01:21:13,556 --> 01:21:15,641
Please, we need to get you
to the airport, and I...

942
01:21:15,725 --> 01:21:17,351
Where's the fly?

943
01:21:21,856 --> 01:21:23,733
Shouldn't there be a fly?

944
01:21:24,734 --> 01:21:27,236
Oh, I need you to be quiet now,
Ms. Hollis, please.

945
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:30,281
- Do you understand?
- Or is that you?

946
01:21:31,282 --> 01:21:34,827
- Be quiet...
- That's why you tell the story, isn't it?

947
01:21:34,910 --> 01:21:38,789
- I'm... I'm not...
- You're the fly, and you fucking know it.

948
01:21:39,790 --> 01:21:41,083
Please be quiet.

949
01:21:41,167 --> 01:21:44,962
You're a fraud, a fake. Buzzing about.

950
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:52,845
Be quiet, please.

951
01:21:55,014 --> 01:21:57,600
It's not real, James.

952
01:21:59,810 --> 01:22:01,771
You're not real.

953
01:25:41,824 --> 01:25:45,911
Legendary artist Jerome Debney
has died at the age of 84.

954
01:25:45,995 --> 01:25:47,747
Debney reportedly suffered a heart attack

955
01:25:47,830 --> 01:25:50,916
at the estate of art dealer Joseph Cassidy
on Lake Como.

956
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,462
The empty frame represented freedom.

957
01:25:54,545 --> 01:25:59,842
It represented a new way to see.
It opened up a way to see.

958
01:26:06,515 --> 01:26:09,477
<i>Reclusive painter Jerome Debney
has died today of a heart attack.</i>

959
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:11,228
<i>The artist had just turned 84.</i>

960
01:26:11,312 --> 01:26:14,774
It's like that,
the disappearance of the act.

961
01:26:14,857 --> 01:26:19,820
The essence of Debney's,
I would say, greatness as an artist.

962
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:22,740
Debney's long career was blighted
by a series of accidental fires,

963
01:26:22,823 --> 01:26:26,035
<i>destroying a gallery in Paris,
his villa in the south of France,</i>

964
01:26:26,118 --> 01:26:29,080
<i>and most recently,
his studio on the Cassidy estate.</i>

965
01:26:29,163 --> 01:26:32,333
Art critic James Figueras,
who recently visited Debney's studio

966
01:26:32,416 --> 01:26:35,419
and is the only critic to have examined
Debney's late work, says that:

967
01:26:35,503 --> 01:26:37,046
"Both as a man and an artist,

968
01:26:37,129 --> 01:26:41,133
Debney possessed the sincerity, depth
and unflinching directness of a prophet.

969
01:26:41,217 --> 01:26:44,011
<i>He was a voice calling out in the desert."</i>

970
01:27:10,413 --> 01:27:11,455
Thank you.

971
01:27:11,539 --> 01:27:13,499
- Thank you so much. Bye.
- Thank you.

972
01:27:14,667 --> 01:27:16,961
Well done, James. Good work.

973
01:27:17,044 --> 01:27:18,296
Excuse me?

974
01:27:18,379 --> 01:27:22,091
Your essay, the real thing.
I mean, so rare nowadays.

975
01:27:23,092 --> 01:27:25,678
I sent an invitation to your friend.

976
01:27:25,761 --> 01:27:28,639
- My friend?
- Yes, you know, Berenice.

977
01:27:28,723 --> 01:27:30,558
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

978
01:27:30,641 --> 01:27:34,395
I had to get a professional acquaintance
to do a bit of research

979
01:27:34,478 --> 01:27:36,856
because she seems to have disappeared.

980
01:27:38,774 --> 01:27:41,861
Difficult thing to do, really, disappear.

981
01:27:41,944 --> 01:27:45,448
- Usually, you need a bit of help.
- What do you mean?

982
01:27:45,531 --> 01:27:49,493
Well, you know, with anything complicated,
you need a bit of assistance.

983
01:27:49,577 --> 01:27:53,205
Bloke I know tried it years ago.
Got into a bit of a scrape.

984
01:27:53,289 --> 01:27:56,459
- Not quite as easy as you think.
- No.

985
01:27:56,542 --> 01:27:59,670
- Lost touch with her, have you?
- Yes. You might say that, yeah.

986
01:27:59,754 --> 01:28:03,716
Yeah. Young love. So volatile.

987
01:28:03,799 --> 01:28:07,637
Yeah. Suppose you had
to sacrifice her to your work.

988
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:12,016
Art can be such a harsh mistress, can't she?

989
01:28:12,099 --> 01:28:13,517
Oh, she can.

990
01:28:14,518 --> 01:28:17,355
Let's mingle a bit, shall we? Come.

991
01:28:19,023 --> 01:28:21,817
Duluth seemed a bit unlikely,
didn't it really?

992
01:28:21,901 --> 01:28:23,069
In which way?

993
01:28:23,152 --> 01:28:27,198
Well, you know, that's where
she was from, really. Just like she said.

994
01:28:27,281 --> 01:28:29,909
Tiny town south of the city.

995
01:28:29,992 --> 01:28:34,538
Lived with her mother and an aunt.
Taught school, if you can imagine that.

996
01:28:35,539 --> 01:28:38,000
- Do you want a drink?
- No, thanks.

997
01:28:38,084 --> 01:28:39,627
No, thanks very much.

998
01:28:41,504 --> 01:28:43,839
I think he might have sent her a drawing.

999
01:28:43,923 --> 01:28:45,675
- Who?
- Debney.

1000
01:28:45,758 --> 01:28:46,801
What do you mean?

1001
01:28:46,884 --> 01:28:52,390
Her mother said she received
a drawing of Berenice, postmark Italy.

1002
01:28:53,891 --> 01:28:56,269
I was a bit upset about that,
as you can imagine.

1003
01:28:56,352 --> 01:28:57,436
Yeah.

1004
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:01,065
Till I found out it wasn't signed
and so it's bloody worthless.

1005
01:29:01,148 --> 01:29:02,984
- Such a shame.
- Oh, yes. What a shame.

1006
01:29:03,067 --> 01:29:04,026
Such a shame.

1007
01:29:05,027 --> 01:29:08,698
I wouldn't worry too much. I mean, she'll
float back into view one of these days.

1008
01:29:08,781 --> 01:29:11,200
I mean, they always do. Yeah.

1009
01:29:11,284 --> 01:29:12,285
Here we are.

1010
01:29:12,368 --> 01:29:14,912
The jewel in the crown.

1011
01:29:16,539 --> 01:29:18,541
You can't smoke in here, James, sorry.

1012
01:29:19,542 --> 01:29:21,460
Oh, I almost forgot.

1013
01:29:21,544 --> 01:29:24,922
This was found in Debney's desk
after he drowned.

1014
01:29:27,008 --> 01:29:28,759
I thought he died of a heart attack.

1015
01:29:28,843 --> 01:29:31,554
Take a pick, one of the two.
I mean, he was in the pool anyway.

1016
01:29:31,637 --> 01:29:33,014
Was he swimming?

1017
01:29:33,097 --> 01:29:35,725
Well, he fell in somehow.
I mean, Rodolfo found him.

1018
01:29:35,808 --> 01:29:38,561
He was all bloated and blue in the face.

1019
01:29:38,644 --> 01:29:41,981
A bit upsetting, really. Hang on a minute.

1020
01:29:42,064 --> 01:29:45,359
Just gonna take this
from <i>The Guardian.</i> Hello?

1021
01:29:46,777 --> 01:29:50,740
James Figueras. Evelina Macri from <i>ARTnews.</i>

1022
01:29:50,823 --> 01:29:51,907
Hello.

1023
01:29:51,991 --> 01:29:53,951
First of all, brilliant job.

1024
01:29:54,035 --> 01:29:56,579
Your restraint is what I found
most extraordinary.

1025
01:29:56,662 --> 01:30:00,666
It's as if you wrote an essay on the solar
system and refused to mention the sun.

1026
01:30:01,959 --> 01:30:05,463
A lesser critic would've hung
his whole thesis on it.

1027
01:30:05,546 --> 01:30:08,716
But you chose to leave it for us
to discover.

1028
01:30:08,799 --> 01:30:10,259
To be shocked by, even.

1029
01:30:10,343 --> 01:30:14,138
- Thank you.
- The ultimate mark of Debney.

1030
01:30:14,221 --> 01:30:17,850
Hidden right in the center of things,
as the truth always is.

1031
01:30:17,934 --> 01:30:23,230
Almost as if he imprinted the mark of Cain
on his own forehead, don't you think?

1032
01:30:23,314 --> 01:30:25,608
Or is that too big a reach?

1033
01:30:26,609 --> 01:30:27,526
Excuse me?

1034
01:30:28,861 --> 01:30:30,529
The fingerprint.

1035
01:30:51,467 --> 01:30:53,219
James.

1036
01:30:53,302 --> 01:30:55,846
James. James, come meet Philip Ricciardi.

1037
01:30:55,930 --> 01:30:58,182
From the Tate Modern.
You'll really like him.

1038
01:30:58,265 --> 01:31:00,393
- You know, don't you?
- Know what?

1039
01:31:00,476 --> 01:31:02,645
- Just say it.
- Say what?

1040
01:31:02,728 --> 01:31:04,397
The truth.

1041
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:06,232
- The truth, James?
- Yes.

1042
01:31:06,315 --> 01:31:09,694
The truth. Come on.

1043
01:31:09,777 --> 01:31:12,071
- Philip. Oh, hello.
- Joseph.

1044
01:31:12,154 --> 01:31:14,282
- You know James?
- James. Of course.

1045
01:31:15,283 --> 01:31:16,742
Evelina.

1046
01:31:37,513 --> 01:31:39,598
Mr. Figueras.

1047
01:31:41,225 --> 01:31:42,351
Thank you.

1048
01:31:56,490 --> 01:31:57,950
<i>Over the weekend, really at worst,</i>

1049
01:31:58,034 --> 01:32:00,286
<i>we're gonna have
just a nuisance round of flurries,</i>

1050
01:32:00,369 --> 01:32:02,496
<i>particularly in Central Minnesota,</i>

1051
01:32:02,580 --> 01:32:05,458
<i>with the real snow starting
either late Sunday night</i>

1052
01:32:05,541 --> 01:32:07,668
<i>or in the predawn hours of Monday.</i>

1053
01:32:07,752 --> 01:32:11,505
<i>It'll be a heavy, wet-consistency snow,
accompanied by wind,</i>

1054
01:32:11,589 --> 01:32:15,426
<i>coming out during the day Monday,
gusts at 30 or 35 miles an hour.</i>

1055
01:32:15,509 --> 01:32:18,054
<i>And this type of storm track favors</i>

1056
01:32:18,137 --> 01:32:22,224
<i>a narrow swath of 8 to 12 inches of snow.</i>

1057
