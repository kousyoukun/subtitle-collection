gotta be someone!

didn't want to tell anybody

got this all figured out!

kind of changed, hasn't it?

Hey, hey, didn't you
take some astrology class

334
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:09,036
a few years ago
when you was trying

335
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:11,404
to be an astronaut or some
stupid shit like that?

336
00:22:11,406 --> 00:22:13,640
No, it was an astronomy class.

337
00:22:13,642 --> 00:22:15,241
I never said I wanted
to be an astronaut.

it's my old biology teacher

we should be talking to.

Okay, whatever,
what's his name?

years ago, John!

Westlake, it was
Professor Westlake.

Are you sure?

Yeah, I'm sure.

I mean, but who knows if
he's still there or not?

00:22:42,604 --> 00:22:44,136
Yeah, he is.

355
00:22:44,138 --> 00:22:46,038
Do you need his cell
phone, email address?

356
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,074
Text it to me.

such a good idea, Brent.

And for two, what
are we gonna do here?

particularly feel safe

You're going back to the field.

367
00:23:10,398 --> 00:23:11,664
And why would I do that?

368
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:13,202
To see if we missed anything.

369

Yeah.

You would do the same.

BRENT: How do you know
you weren't followed?

664
00:39:03,017 --> 00:39:04,316
I just act like
I was in a movie

665
00:39:04,318 --> 00:39:06,084
and made myself hard to find.

666
00:39:06,086 --> 00:39:08,120
Yeah, that must've been easy.

667

You might wanna
take that up with God

with the way that I look.

You might want
to rethink that.

670
00:39:14,995 --> 00:39:17,229
Do we really gotta be
in here with that thing?

671
00:39:17,231 --> 00:39:19,698
I mean, why can't we just go
and talk in the living room?

672
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,435
Because unfortunately
I'm not wireless.

673
00:39:22,437 --> 00:39:24,736
I mean, doesn't that
shit creep y'all out?

674
00:39:24,738 --> 00:39:27,339
Look man, I'm still not
convinced that that thing

675
00:39:27,341 --> 00:39:29,408
is the beginning of
some kind of invasion.

676

It's not.

Oh, and you know?

678
00:39:31,178 --> 00:39:32,981
I know because it showed me.

679
00:39:34,281 --> 00:39:35,613
What did it show you?

680
00:39:35,615 --> 00:39:37,582
Things about itself.

681
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:39,151
About where it comes from.

682
00:39:39,153 --> 00:39:42,053

he's talking about?

686
00:39:48,095 --> 00:39:50,261
Did it show you that
stuff too, or...

687
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:51,066
I'm not sure.

688

What does that mean?

689
00:39:53,234 --> 00:39:55,000
I saw flashes of something
when it touched me,

690
00:39:55,002 --> 00:39:58,104
but it was so fast I
couldn't make sense of it.

691
00:39:58,106 --> 00:40:02,107
Like a dream that you can't
remember in the morning.

692
00:40:02,109 --> 00:40:02,944
I still see it.

693
00:40:03,611 --> 00:40:06,178
You guys, you gotta see it.

694
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,214
Just let it touch you.

695
00:40:08,216 --> 00:40:09,615
Hell nah!

696
00:40:09,617 --> 00:40:12,084
Man, I ain't going
near that thing.

697
00:40:12,086 --> 00:40:13,118
Right?

698
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,086

No.

700
00:40:16,089 --> 00:40:18,189
It actually made me feel better.

701
00:40:18,191 --> 00:40:19,024
Better?

702
00:40:19,026 --> 00:40:21,227
Yeah, like I could
breathe easier.

703
00:40:21,229 --> 00:40:24,662
Well, then why were
you shaking on the floor

704
00:40:24,664 --> 00:40:26,399
when it touched you?

705
00:40:26,401 --> 00:40:28,801
I mean, you were
flailing around in pain,

706
00:40:28,803 --> 00:40:30,602
I saw it, you were in pain!

707
00:40:30,604 --> 00:40:33,238
No, it was trying
to figure me out.

708
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:37,109
My injury confused it.

709
00:40:37,111 --> 00:40:38,444
I don't get it.

710

never walk again...

that you'll understand

Nope.

No thank you.

I don't trust that thing.

717
00:40:51,292 --> 00:40:53,825
Isn't this what they
teach you in church?

718

719

be a miracle, huh?

Why can't this be God?

724

You better talk to
your brother, man.

questioning my faith.

time we might have

to test your little
miracle theory

728
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:25,691

a broken jaw, how about that?

Mr. Doyle, why
don't you have a seat

834
00:47:29,923 --> 00:47:31,557
and tell us what you were doing

835
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:33,894
at Roger Cobb's
farm this morning?

836

I'd rather stand.

837

No, you're gonna sit down.

838

839
00:47:43,571 --> 00:47:46,772
any abnormal sensations
or discomfort?

is quite impossible.

reassured if it could touch you.

It's just a feeling, I guess.

855
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,683
Did it tell you
to let it touch me?

01:04:59,638 --> 01:05:01,037
What do you want?

1145
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:02,939
Want to ask you some
questions, if you don't mind.

1146
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:04,008
I'm working.

1147
01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:05,044
We won't be long.

1148
01:05:08,647 --> 01:05:09,814
What do you want to know?

1149
01:05:09,816 --> 01:05:12,015
Your colleague over there
says that you are friendly

1150
01:05:12,017 --> 01:05:13,519
with a Mr. Marcus Doyle?

1151
01:05:14,586 --> 01:05:15,852
What about him?

1152
01:05:15,854 --> 01:05:18,555
We happen to believe
that he might be here.

1153
01:05:18,557 --> 01:05:19,624
Well, I haven't seen him.

1154
01:05:19,626 --> 01:05:20,691
You positive?

1155
01:05:20,693 --> 01:05:21,926
It's pretty busy.

1156
01:05:21,928 --> 01:05:23,560
He's kinda hard to
miss, don't you think?

1157
01:05:23,562 --> 01:05:25,062
TEVIS: Don't get snippy.

1158
01:05:25,064 --> 01:05:26,296
It's a touchy subject.

1159
01:05:26,298 --> 01:05:28,665
I dated his buddy and
it didn't end well.

1160
01:05:28,667 --> 01:05:30,667
Once a cheater, always
a cheater, right?

1161
01:05:30,669 --> 01:05:31,504
Hmm.

1162
01:05:32,506 --> 01:05:33,941
It wouldn't happen to
be this guy, would it?

1163
01:05:36,175 --> 01:05:37,109
Yep, that's him.

1164
01:05:38,243 --> 01:05:39,146
What's his name?

1165
01:05:39,979 --> 01:05:41,611
John.

1166
01:05:41,613 --> 01:05:42,482
Johnathan Brandt.

1167
01:05:43,649 --> 01:05:45,716
We're looking for him, too.

1168
01:05:45,718 --> 01:05:47,187
Well, I haven't
seen him, either.

1169
01:05:48,988 --> 01:05:50,787
He's probably with Brent.

1170
01:05:50,789 --> 01:05:51,624
Brent who?

1171
01:05:53,292 --> 01:05:54,126
He wouldn't be a friend
of Marcus too, would he?

1172
01:05:56,328 --> 01:05:57,995
Look...

1173
01:05:57,997 --> 01:05:59,296
These are good guys
and I don't want

1174
01:05:59,298 --> 01:06:01,064
to get them into
any kind of trouble.

1175
01:06:01,066 --> 01:06:03,600
Darlin', they're
already in trouble.

1176
01:06:03,602 --> 01:06:05,770
Yeah, we're trying to
get them out of trouble.

1177
01:06:05,772 --> 01:06:08,275
Look, I promise you
we're here to help them.

1178
01:06:09,642 --> 01:06:10,941
You know what, let's
start with an easy one.

1179
01:06:10,943 --> 01:06:12,512
What's Brent's last name?

1180
01:06:16,348 --> 01:06:17,615
Fleming.

1181
01:06:17,617 --> 01:06:18,649
You sure?

1182
01:06:18,651 --> 01:06:19,283
You hesitated a little.

1183
01:06:19,285 --> 01:06:20,750
Brent Fleming?

1184
01:06:20,752 --> 01:06:21,588
Yes.

1185
01:06:24,691 --> 01:06:26,656
I want an APB
on a Brent Fleming

1186
01:06:26,658 --> 01:06:29,093
in any vehicle
registered in his name.

1187
01:06:29,095 --> 01:06:30,196
Oops.

1188
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:37,604
Hey, could you get me a
Diet Coke to go, please?

1189
01:06:40,205 --> 01:06:41,040
Thank you.

1190
01:06:43,676 --> 01:06:45,679
- Hello?
- In here.

1191
01:06:46,879 --> 01:06:47,881
In the garage.

1192
01:06:52,785 --> 01:06:54,588
Hey, thanks for coming.

1193
01:06:55,321 --> 01:06:56,156
You sounded...

1194
01:06:57,055 --> 01:06:58,788
It concerned me.

1195
01:06:58,790 --> 01:06:59,957
So good to see you.

1196
01:06:59,959 --> 01:07:02,993
I can't believe
it's been a year.

1197
01:07:02,995 --> 01:07:04,662
Where are the others?

1198
01:07:04,664 --> 01:07:05,895
I thought they'd be here.

1199
01:07:05,897 --> 01:07:07,131
I don't know,
they're not here.

1200
01:07:07,133 --> 01:07:08,799
They left you
here by yourself?

1201
01:07:08,801 --> 01:07:12,039
Yeah, I mean, I'm a grown-up,
I can take care of myself.

1202
01:07:13,906 --> 01:07:15,238
What did you want
to show me, Will?

1203
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,243
I can't stay long.

1204
01:07:18,044 --> 01:07:21,245
Still so hard to
look at me, huh?

1205
01:07:21,247 --> 01:07:22,245
This is not the time for this.

1206
01:07:22,247 --> 01:07:24,115
Haven't I been
punished enough?

1207
01:07:24,117 --> 01:07:25,049
That's not fair.

1208
01:07:25,051 --> 01:07:25,685
Fair to who?

1209
01:07:26,752 --> 01:07:28,754
Since when is any of this fair?

1210
01:07:29,789 --> 01:07:30,787
I don't want to do this.

1211
01:07:30,789 --> 01:07:31,624
Jess, wait.

1212
01:07:38,731 --> 01:07:40,300
What are you doing?

1213
01:07:50,443 --> 01:07:52,109
What's it look like?

1214
01:07:52,111 --> 01:07:53,343
How?

1215
01:07:53,345 --> 01:07:54,780
That's what I'm
gonna show you.

1216
01:07:57,249 --> 01:07:58,851
This is amazing.

1217
01:08:00,185 --> 01:08:01,021
Ready?

1218
01:08:10,363 --> 01:08:11,765
Oh shit.

1219
01:08:17,169 --> 01:08:19,937
Apparently he doesn't
have any family.

1220
01:08:19,939 --> 01:08:21,171
It's just him.

1221
01:08:21,173 --> 01:08:22,840
So what do they
expect us to do?

1222
01:08:22,841 --> 01:08:23,676
Nothing.

1223
01:08:24,910 --> 01:08:27,010
The way the doctor explained,
it's just a matter of time.

1224
01:08:27,011 --> 01:08:28,411
And John's with him?

1225
01:08:28,412 --> 01:08:30,214
Yeah, room four.

1226
01:08:30,216 --> 01:08:32,349
He was so alive
just a few hours ago.

1227
01:08:32,350 --> 01:08:33,720
- You don't think...
- No.

1228
01:08:34,921 --> 01:08:37,758
The nurse said he was taking
a lot of pain medications.

1229
01:08:38,423 --> 01:08:40,357
I know what you're thinking.

1230
01:08:40,359 --> 01:08:42,361
This wasn't caused
by anything we did.

1231
01:08:43,895 --> 01:08:45,895
Or it did.

1232
01:08:45,897 --> 01:08:47,700
Then how can you be so sure?

1233
01:08:49,033 --> 01:08:50,935
Let's just get
this over with, okay?

1234
01:08:53,805 --> 01:08:56,372
My goal was to die teaching.

1235
01:08:56,374 --> 01:08:59,777
But you already are a teacher.

1236
01:08:59,779 --> 01:09:01,746
No, I mean
physically teaching,

1237
01:09:01,747 --> 01:09:04,749
right in the middle
of a class, boom!

in front of a whole lecture
hall full of students.

1240
01:09:08,886 --> 01:09:11,322
Yeah, that sounds
a little crazy.

Yeah, but it's got a
certain amount of panache.

Oh, what a pleasant surprise.

I wasn't expecting company.

1246

This is our friend Marcus.

1247
01:09:22,968 --> 01:09:25,001
He was one of the people
who found the object.

1248
01:09:25,002 --> 01:09:26,836
I've got someone
else to thank.

1249
01:09:26,837 --> 01:09:28,005
Thank you, Marcus.

Great, let's start with
getting me the hell out of here.

What are you doing?

1254
01:09:36,247 --> 01:09:37,947
I am not spending
the final hours

of my life in a hospital.

1256
01:09:39,417 --> 01:09:41,452
I don't think that
you can do that.

1257
01:09:41,453 --> 01:09:42,923
I can do anything I want.

1258
01:09:44,022 --> 01:09:45,890

of the dying.

if they're in there.

Oh, he's in there.

Instead he got sloppy
and make a mistake.

go in and find out.
