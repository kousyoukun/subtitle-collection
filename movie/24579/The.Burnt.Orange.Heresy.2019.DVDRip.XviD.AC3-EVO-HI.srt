14
00:02:14,876 --> 00:02:18,613
Let me be blunt.

15
00:02:18,747 --> 00:02:24,251
Art would not exist
without criticism.

16
00:02:24,385 --> 00:02:29,758
It would not exist.

17
00:02:29,891 --> 00:02:34,196
I like to think of myself and
my fellow critics, collectively,

18
00:02:34,328 --> 00:02:35,997
as the banks on a river,

19
00:02:36,131 --> 00:02:39,000
and art is the water
that flows between us.

20
00:02:39,134 --> 00:02:42,671
And we work
to channel this flow,

21
00:02:42,804 --> 00:02:44,238
guide it, to restrain it,

22
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:47,576
you might even say.
Because without banks,

23
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:53,048
even the greatest
of torrents would be, what?

24

30
00:03:12,399 --> 00:03:14,435

this is no more interesting

31
00:03:14,568 --> 00:03:16,138
than your average wallpaper,

Well, don't be ashamed. He's not
very well-known in America.

36
00:03:31,285 --> 00:03:33,822
Don't be ashamed. He's not
very well-known in America.

37
00:03:33,955 --> 00:03:36,290
Let me tell you
a little bit about Nils.

38
00:03:36,423 --> 00:03:39,261
Nils was 16 and already
something of a prodigy

39
00:03:39,393 --> 00:03:41,395
when the Nazis invaded Norway.

40
00:03:41,529 --> 00:03:44,833
Nils and his twin sister joined
the Resistance

41
00:03:44,966 --> 00:03:46,268
a year into the occupation.

42
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,402
They were betrayed.

43
00:03:50,138 --> 00:03:52,439
Betrayed, arrested
and transported

44
00:03:52,573 --> 00:03:56,044
to the concentration camp
in Buchenwald.

45
00:03:56,178 --> 00:03:58,847
Nils kept himself
and his sister alive

46
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,982
by painting portraits
of the camp officers.

47
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,852
And this is something
for which he felt great shame

48
00:04:03,985 --> 00:04:05,187
after the war.

49
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:07,689
So Nils vowed two things:

50
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,358
Never to paint
another human figure

51
00:04:11,492 --> 00:04:14,262
and never to touch
a brush again.

52
00:04:14,395 --> 00:04:16,631
And, therefore...

53
00:04:16,765 --> 00:04:19,034
...the rough working
of the paint.

54
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:21,603
All of Nils' postwar canvases
were undertaken

55
00:04:21,736 --> 00:04:25,640
either with a palette knife
or with his fingers.

56
00:04:25,774 --> 00:04:28,542
Nils titled
this particular painting, <i>Nora,</i>

57
00:04:28,677 --> 00:04:30,245
after his sister.

58
00:04:31,947 --> 00:04:35,584
She died, in 1955,
of consumption,

59
00:04:35,717 --> 00:04:38,253
which she contracted
at Buchenwald.

60
00:04:38,385 --> 00:04:40,722
And that gray...

61
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,524
And that... And that gray...

62
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:46,962
That gray,
vaguely avian shape...

63
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:53,235
some see that as
a representation of Nora's soul,

64
00:04:53,367 --> 00:04:56,171
slipping its earthly bonds,
free at last,

65
00:04:56,304 --> 00:04:59,774
after enduring
so much horror here.

66
00:04:59,908 --> 00:05:02,543
Ahem, this painting
was Nils' last painting.

67
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,213
With Nora dead,
he, uh, refused to eat anything,

68
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:09,851
and nothing but water passed
his lips for the next 27 days.

69
00:05:09,985 --> 00:05:13,487
He continued to work
on the canvas as he weakened,

70
00:05:13,622 --> 00:05:17,192
and reportedly
that bird-like shape

71
00:05:17,325 --> 00:05:19,728
was the last detail
that he added.

72
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:24,199
So I suppose
you could see this painting...

73
00:05:25,466 --> 00:05:26,935

skill than you first assumed.

81
00:05:51,593 --> 00:05:55,429
