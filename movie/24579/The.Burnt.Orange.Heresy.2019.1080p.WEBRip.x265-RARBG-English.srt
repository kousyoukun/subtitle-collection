1
00:01:57,247 --> 00:01:58,770
Fuck.

2
00:02:14,003 --> 00:02:17,963
Let me be blunt.

3
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:23,491
Art would not exist
without criticism.

4
00:02:23,665 --> 00:02:29,149
It would not exist.

5
00:02:29,323 --> 00:02:33,414
I like to think of myself and
my fellow critics, collectively,

6
00:02:33,588 --> 00:02:35,459
as the banks on a river,

7
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:38,462
and art is the water
that flows between us.

8
00:02:38,636 --> 00:02:42,031
And we work
to channel this flow,

9
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:43,772
guide it, to restrain it,

10
00:02:43,946 --> 00:02:46,905
you might even say.
Because without banks,

11
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:52,520
even the greatest
of torrents would be, what?

12
00:02:52,694 --> 00:02:57,002
Floodplain, listless expanse
of mud and flies.

13
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,875
Now, ahem,
ladies and gentlemen,

14
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:03,922
please examine this painting,
if you will.

15
00:03:04,096 --> 00:03:06,447
What do you feel?

16
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:09,014
Indifference, am I correct?

17
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,800
You are unmoved.

18
00:03:11,974 --> 00:03:13,715
Let's be honest,
this is no more interesting

19
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:15,630
than your average wallpaper,
is it?

20
00:03:15,804 --> 00:03:19,286
Look at the brushstrokes, so--
Ha, so rough and clumsy.

21
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:22,376
Almost like
a child's painting, no?

22
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:27,598
Is anyone here familiar
with the work of Nils Ingen?

23
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:30,645
Well, don't be ashamed. He's not
very well-known in America.

24
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:33,213
Don't be ashamed. He's not
very well-known in America.

25
00:03:33,387 --> 00:03:35,824
Let me tell you
a little bit about Nils.

26
00:03:35,998 --> 00:03:38,479
Nils was 16 and already
something of a prodigy

27
00:03:38,653 --> 00:03:40,655
when the Nazis invaded Norway.

28
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:44,224
Nils and his twin sister joined
the Resistance

29
00:03:44,398 --> 00:03:45,486
a year into the occupation.

30
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,357
They were betrayed.

31
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,709
Betrayed, arrested
and transported

32
00:03:51,883 --> 00:03:55,496
to the concentration camp
in Buchenwald.

33
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,238
Nils kept himself
and his sister alive

34
00:03:58,412 --> 00:04:00,414
by painting portraits
of the camp officers.

35
00:04:00,588 --> 00:04:02,938
And this is something
for which he felt great shame

36
00:04:03,112 --> 00:04:04,374
after the war.

37
00:04:04,548 --> 00:04:06,724
So Nils vowed two things:

38
00:04:08,422 --> 00:04:10,598
Never to paint
another human figure

39
00:04:10,772 --> 00:04:13,470
and never to touch
a brush again.

40
00:04:13,644 --> 00:04:15,951
And, therefore...

41
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,475
...the rough working
of the paint.

42
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:20,912
All of Nils' postwar canvases
were undertaken

43
00:04:21,086 --> 00:04:24,960
either with a palette knife
or with his fingers.

44
00:04:25,134 --> 00:04:27,832
Nils titled
this particular painting, Nora,

45
00:04:28,006 --> 00:04:29,443
after his sister.

46
00:04:31,358 --> 00:04:34,883
She died, in 1955,
of consumption,

47
00:04:35,057 --> 00:04:37,451
which she contracted
at Buchenwald.

48
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,757
And that gray...

49
00:04:41,498 --> 00:04:42,804
And that-- And that gray...

50
00:04:42,978 --> 00:04:46,068
That gray,
vaguely avian shape...

51
00:04:48,592 --> 00:04:52,727
some see that as
a representation of Nora's soul,

52
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:55,643
slipping its earthly bonds,
free at last,

53
00:04:55,817 --> 00:04:59,124
after enduring
so much horror here.

54
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,823
Ahem, this painting
was Nils' last painting.

55
00:05:01,997 --> 00:05:04,695
With Nora dead,
he, uh, refused to eat anything,

56
00:05:04,869 --> 00:05:09,221
and nothing but water passed
his lips for the next 27 days.

57
00:05:09,396 --> 00:05:12,747
He continued to work
on the canvas as he weakened,

58
00:05:12,921 --> 00:05:16,664
and reportedly
that bird-like shape

59
00:05:16,838 --> 00:05:19,057
was the last detail
that he added.

60
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:23,366
So I suppose
you could see this painting...

61
00:05:24,715 --> 00:05:26,326
as a suicide note.

62
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,458
A cri de coeur,
famous last words,

63
00:05:28,632 --> 00:05:30,591
cry from the heart.

64
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,250
Looks like a different painting
now, doesn't it?

65
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:42,559
It looks like
a different painting now.

66
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:45,040
Doesn't it?
Absolutely.

67
00:05:45,214 --> 00:05:47,869
There's a poignancy to it
you hadn't noticed before,

68
00:05:48,043 --> 00:05:51,002
and there's far more technical
skill than you first assumed.

69
00:05:51,176 --> 00:05:54,658
And all of this simply
because of what I, as a critic

70
00:05:54,832 --> 00:05:56,617
and an expert,
have shared with you.

71
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:59,533
I suppose you could say
that I have shaped

72
00:05:59,707 --> 00:06:02,840
your experience
of this painting.

73
00:06:03,014 --> 00:06:05,626
Would anyone like a print?

74
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,718
Let me, um...

75
00:06:10,892 --> 00:06:13,547
Let me share
one last detail with you.

76
00:06:13,721 --> 00:06:17,246
Everything I just told you
about Nils and Nora...

77
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,509
Lies. Lies.

78
00:06:19,683 --> 00:06:22,338
Lies. Just a pack of lies.

79
00:06:22,512 --> 00:06:23,600
I painted this painting.

80
00:06:25,863 --> 00:06:28,605
And it's trash.
And you can see that, right?

81
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:30,912
It took me 30 minutes.
And it's just paint

82
00:06:31,086 --> 00:06:35,003
slapped down without
any real care or inspiration.

83
00:06:35,177 --> 00:06:37,484
So is anyone
still interested in a print?

84
00:06:40,051 --> 00:06:42,837
Ha-ha, no, I thought not.

85
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:45,492
I single-handedly
made you believe

86
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:48,364
that this was a masterpiece.

87
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:52,934
You believed,
you have to admit it.

88
00:06:53,108 --> 00:06:55,937
That, my dear friends,
is the power of the critic,

89
00:06:56,111 --> 00:06:58,461
and that's why you should be
careful with someone like me.

90
00:07:04,293 --> 00:07:05,947
Thank you. Thank you.

91
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:34,845
You're not really how I imagined
an art critic would look.

92
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:36,847
Well, you know what they say

93
00:07:37,021 --> 00:07:39,371
about the book
and its cover, Ms., um...?

94
00:07:39,546 --> 00:07:42,940
Hollis. Berenice Hollis.

95
00:07:43,114 --> 00:07:44,986
Are you interested in art,
Ms. Hollis?

96
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,378
I just came here
for the chips.

97
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:49,643
No offense, Mr. Figueras.

98
00:07:49,817 --> 00:07:52,036
I just reached a point
in my life where I appreciate

99
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,038
the value of free things.Oh, I see.

100
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:57,825
So that painting...

101
00:07:57,999 --> 00:07:59,174
I'd like a print.

102
00:08:04,788 --> 00:08:06,616
There aren't any.

103
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:10,620
That was just what you call
an oratorical gesture.

104
00:08:10,794 --> 00:08:13,493
Oh, you're one of those.

105
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:15,930
One of which?A liar.

106
00:08:18,802 --> 00:08:20,848
That's harsh, don't you think?

107
00:08:21,022 --> 00:08:22,763
If the shoe fits.

108
00:08:24,895 --> 00:08:26,288
Yeah.

109
00:08:50,486 --> 00:08:51,705
Sorry.Sorry.

110
00:09:06,284 --> 00:09:07,764
Water?

111
00:09:11,202 --> 00:09:13,291
Ever wonder when something
is just starting,

112
00:09:13,465 --> 00:09:14,249
how it's gonna end?

113
00:09:14,423 --> 00:09:15,380
Like what?

114
00:09:16,643 --> 00:09:18,470
Anything. Us, say.

115
00:09:24,128 --> 00:09:26,000
A week from now,
I'll be planning our wedding.

116
00:09:26,174 --> 00:09:27,915
Hm.

117
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:29,438
Then I'll take you
to an opening,

118
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:31,092
and as I look across the room,

119
00:09:31,266 --> 00:09:33,137
I'll see you talking
to this artist,

120
00:09:33,311 --> 00:09:37,141
this broad-shouldered
artist, um, sculptor.

121
00:09:37,315 --> 00:09:39,404
Big hands.

122
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:43,017
And as you leave with him,
you give me a little wave.

123
00:09:43,191 --> 00:09:45,846
And I'll climb to the top
of the duomo,

124
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,066
throw myself off in grief.

125
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,939
You're gonna make me your whore.

126
00:09:52,113 --> 00:09:53,723
I'll be turning tricks
to support you

127
00:09:53,897 --> 00:09:56,334
while you visit your galleries
and write your articles

128
00:09:56,508 --> 00:09:58,772
and you sip champagne
with your high-class friends.

129
00:09:58,946 --> 00:10:00,730
For love. Mm-hm.That's right.

130
00:10:00,904 --> 00:10:03,864
I'll catch some disease,
lose my teeth, go blind...

131
00:10:04,038 --> 00:10:05,953
No....be dead in a year.

132
00:10:06,127 --> 00:10:07,476
All for love.

133
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,522
We'll have babies.

134
00:10:10,697 --> 00:10:13,787
Girl named Amy, boy named Matt.

135
00:10:13,961 --> 00:10:16,703
We'll move to the States,
Connecticut probably.

136
00:10:16,877 --> 00:10:19,619
Buy a house, porch with a swing
and a brook.

137
00:10:19,793 --> 00:10:20,924
Babbling.

138
00:10:21,098 --> 00:10:23,144
Of course. And a stone wall.

139
00:10:23,318 --> 00:10:24,493
And I'll die first.

140
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:26,103
Some sort of lingering cancer

141
00:10:26,277 --> 00:10:28,149
that you'll nurse me through.

142
00:10:28,323 --> 00:10:29,324
And then you.

143
00:10:29,498 --> 00:10:30,978
And our kids will insist

144
00:10:31,152 --> 00:10:33,763
that you died of a broken heart.

145
00:10:34,895 --> 00:10:36,200
I'm gonna get up now.

146
00:10:36,374 --> 00:10:37,811
Shower, leave.

147
00:10:37,985 --> 00:10:40,770
We'll never
see each other again.

148
00:10:40,944 --> 00:10:43,033
All you gotta do is lie here
and let it happen.

149
00:10:44,426 --> 00:10:46,167
Got it?

150
00:10:46,341 --> 00:10:47,603
Got it.

151
00:10:57,265 --> 00:10:58,919
Ciao.

152
00:11:14,064 --> 00:11:15,326
Come in.

153
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,459
Want an upper?

154
00:11:18,373 --> 00:11:19,156
Sure.

155
00:11:26,294 --> 00:11:28,165
What are you doing this weekend?Heh.

156
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:30,777
What?

157
00:11:30,951 --> 00:11:32,996
You're supposed to ask me out
before you fuck me.

158
00:11:35,477 --> 00:11:37,435
Ever heard of Joseph Cassidy?The art dealer?

159
00:11:37,609 --> 00:11:38,567
Mm-hm.Yeah.

160
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:40,917
Been invited to his estate.

161
00:11:41,091 --> 00:11:43,180
You got rich friends.Well, I've never met him.

162
00:11:43,354 --> 00:11:46,053
Then why the invite?I'm guessing he wants me

163
00:11:46,227 --> 00:11:47,881
to write a catalog
for his collection,

164
00:11:48,055 --> 00:11:50,318
and it would be a nice gig
if I could land it.

165
00:11:50,492 --> 00:11:54,670
And I bet there'll be
some free cucumber sandwiches.

166
00:11:54,844 --> 00:11:57,412
Hm.So, what do you say?

167
00:11:57,586 --> 00:12:01,111
You'll be my chauffeur?Share the driving?

168
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:51,988
James, hi. Um...

169
00:12:52,162 --> 00:12:54,164
It's Louisa, Louisa Prentes.

170
00:12:54,338 --> 00:12:56,601
It's rather awkward for me
to be calling about this,

171
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,822
but the check you gave me
was returned by my bank.

172
00:12:59,996 --> 00:13:02,129
Um, if you'd give me
a call back, thanks.

173
00:13:10,224 --> 00:13:11,703
Who died, little girl?

174
00:13:11,878 --> 00:13:13,705
Your poor Norwegian.

175
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,490
I keep thinking he was real.

176
00:13:15,664 --> 00:13:17,448
He was real.

177
00:13:17,622 --> 00:13:20,800
You said you made him up.No, just the end.

178
00:13:20,974 --> 00:13:23,237
Nils and Nora were real,

179
00:13:23,411 --> 00:13:25,674
and Nils survived
for a time at Buchenwald

180
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:27,719
by painting the German officers.

181
00:13:27,894 --> 00:13:30,505
For a time.For a time.

182
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:33,769
In medieval painting,
the fly represented sin,

183
00:13:33,943 --> 00:13:37,773
so if an artist added a fly
to a portrait, for instance,

184
00:13:37,947 --> 00:13:40,689
it meant that
that person was damned.

185
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:43,170
I suppose you can see
where this is headed.

186
00:13:43,344 --> 00:13:44,998
Nils painted flies
on the Germans.

187
00:13:45,172 --> 00:13:48,653
He did. Unfortunately,
his camp commandant

188
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,656
was something
of an amateur art historian,

189
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:56,009
and he took exception,
and Nils was gutted like a deer,

190
00:13:56,183 --> 00:13:57,532
left in the yard
for the flies...

191
00:13:57,706 --> 00:13:59,839
Stop....to feast on.

192
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,929
You asked.

193
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:07,107
What about Nora?

194
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:10,066
Nora spent
her postwar years in Paris,

195
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,155
drinking too much
and painting some.

196
00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:13,809
Badly, I'm afraid.

197
00:14:13,983 --> 00:14:16,377
She just wasted away, basically.

198
00:14:16,551 --> 00:14:20,163
That was Nora's painting
you showed us, wasn't it?

199
00:14:20,337 --> 00:14:23,079
Why didn't you say so?

200
00:14:23,253 --> 00:14:24,951
Because my story's
much more poignant,

201
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,518
Nils starving and everything.Yeah, but it's not true.

202
00:14:27,692 --> 00:14:30,304
Ha-ha, does that matter?Of course it matters.

203
00:14:30,478 --> 00:14:33,350
That's what art's about,
isn't it? The truth.

204
00:14:33,524 --> 00:14:35,831
No.

205
00:14:36,005 --> 00:14:38,921
I mean, pumpkin, if it's just
about telling the truth,

206
00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:41,402
anybody could do it.

207
00:14:41,576 --> 00:14:43,970
My job is to separate
the good lies from the bad ones.

208
00:14:44,144 --> 00:14:47,582
And how do you do that?Oh...

209
00:14:47,756 --> 00:14:50,802
Well, is your name
really Berenice?

210
00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:56,591
Why would I make that up?

211
00:14:56,765 --> 00:14:58,810
That's not a yes.

212
00:14:58,985 --> 00:15:00,987
It's not a no either.

213
00:15:05,426 --> 00:15:06,514
Okay.

214
00:16:01,308 --> 00:16:03,223
Let's get the bags.

215
00:16:38,475 --> 00:16:40,738
Lunch is in an hour.
Please be prompt.

216
00:16:40,912 --> 00:16:42,131
Thank you.

217
00:17:05,285 --> 00:17:07,504
I was a kid...

218
00:17:07,678 --> 00:17:10,855
exactly the kind of place
I dreamed of living.

219
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,335
Princess in a castle.

220
00:17:12,509 --> 00:17:14,294
How about you?

221
00:17:14,468 --> 00:17:16,731
What'd you wanna be
when you were a kid?

222
00:17:16,905 --> 00:17:18,776
Oh, I was never a kid.

223
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:21,214
I hatched from the egg
like this, fully grown.

224
00:17:21,388 --> 00:17:23,781
Come on.

225
00:17:23,955 --> 00:17:26,132
Seriously, you can't tell me
you never wanted to paint.

226
00:17:29,222 --> 00:17:31,528
Have you ever been to New York?

227
00:17:31,702 --> 00:17:34,488
Yeah.Know those big banners they hang

228
00:17:34,662 --> 00:17:36,968
outside the museums
for special exhibitions?

229
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:38,100
Mm-hm.

230
00:17:39,275 --> 00:17:41,147
I wanted one.

231
00:17:44,454 --> 00:17:46,108
"Figueras."

232
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:49,416
I had a teacher in art school.

233
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,634
Good teacher.

234
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,768
She took me aside one day

235
00:17:53,942 --> 00:17:55,335
and told me
that I was much better

236
00:17:55,509 --> 00:17:57,946
at talking about art
than doing it,

237
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,993
and said it only had to be
a tragedy if I made it one.

238
00:18:02,168 --> 00:18:04,431
You still want
that banner though, don't you?

239
00:18:29,804 --> 00:18:31,893
Follow your heart.

240
00:18:37,942 --> 00:18:39,161
Oh...

241
00:18:41,424 --> 00:18:44,514
Do you realize how many museums

242
00:18:44,688 --> 00:18:47,648
that would consider this
their centerpiece?

243
00:18:47,822 --> 00:18:51,217
And here, it's just another
slap of paint on the wall.

244
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:52,479
He live alone?

245
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:54,916
Has that feel, doesn't it?

246
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,396
Must be lonely.

247
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,402
What?Man like Cassidy? It's a choice.

248
00:19:02,576 --> 00:19:06,101
Women can't understand that as
a rule, the allure of solitude.

249
00:19:06,275 --> 00:19:07,537
And you do?Oh, yeah.

250
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:09,278
This is how I live too.

251
00:19:09,452 --> 00:19:11,672
On a...

252
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:14,544
slightly more modest scale,
but still.

253
00:19:14,718 --> 00:19:16,503
Just a lone wolf, huh?

254
00:19:16,677 --> 00:19:19,506
Scoff all you want.
I've been a monk here in Italy.

255
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,335
Art my only mistress.Uh-huh.

256
00:19:30,647 --> 00:19:33,563
I bet you
he overpaid for these.

257
00:19:33,737 --> 00:19:36,914
And 10 years from now, he won't
be able to give them away.

258
00:19:37,088 --> 00:19:39,526
Would it help you, Mr. Figueras,
if I told you

259
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,964
that I had a terrible stammer
when I was a child?

260
00:19:43,138 --> 00:19:46,533
Took me years to get over it.I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

261
00:19:46,707 --> 00:19:49,710
A neighbor of mine gave me
some advice.

262
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:54,541
Try and sing through the words
to help ease their passage.

263
00:19:54,715 --> 00:19:57,413
This makes my attachment
to these pictures

264
00:19:57,587 --> 00:20:00,111
seem a bit sentimental, I know,

265
00:20:00,286 --> 00:20:02,636
but I like the reminder
that they bring,

266
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,855
that I should never let
a thing's worth

267
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:06,944
obscure its value.

268
00:20:07,118 --> 00:20:08,685
Ms. Hollis.

269
00:20:08,859 --> 00:20:10,121
Am I correct?Mm-hm.

270
00:20:10,296 --> 00:20:11,993
Joseph Cassidy.

271
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:15,736
Welcome to my summer cottage.Thank you for having us.

272
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,085
Aperitivo,anyone?

273
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:22,177
I really must apologize.

274
00:20:22,351 --> 00:20:26,399
I couldn't help but overhear
your conversation as I entered.

275
00:20:26,573 --> 00:20:28,139
It was fascinating.

276
00:20:28,314 --> 00:20:30,881
People and their hunches.

277
00:20:31,055 --> 00:20:33,536
How some have the gift
and others don't.

278
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:37,758
Always trust your hunches,
my dear. You have the gift.

279
00:20:37,932 --> 00:20:40,761
You were quite right to suspect
that Mr. Figueras here

280
00:20:40,935 --> 00:20:43,329
has been leading a decidedly
un-monastic existence

281
00:20:43,503 --> 00:20:45,809
during his Italian sojourn.

282
00:20:45,983 --> 00:20:48,247
There was a Ms. Sofia Rosselli,

283
00:20:48,421 --> 00:20:51,119
and then there was
a Mrs. Louisa Prentes,

284
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:54,122
and then, uh-- Oh, come on.

285
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:56,777
Don't look so uncomfortable,
Mr. Figueras.

286
00:20:56,951 --> 00:21:00,389
I invited you over to my house,
I'm bound to make inquiries.

287
00:21:00,563 --> 00:21:04,175
By the way, my home life,
you completely misread it.

288
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,481
This is my wife's estate.

289
00:21:05,655 --> 00:21:07,527
It's been in her family
for generations.

290
00:21:07,701 --> 00:21:09,964
If you'd have come yesterday,
you would've found the place

291
00:21:10,138 --> 00:21:12,532
swarming with people.
I mean, children, grandchildren,

292
00:21:12,706 --> 00:21:14,447
dogs, cats, nannies.

293
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:16,275
They decamped
for London this morning,

294
00:21:16,449 --> 00:21:17,798
the whole bloody shooting match.

295
00:21:17,972 --> 00:21:22,455
Can still sort of smell them
a bit though, can't you?

296
00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:25,806
That sort of funny child smell.

297
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,068
Um...
Jim.

298
00:21:27,242 --> 00:21:30,854
Can I call you Jim?Please.

299
00:21:31,028 --> 00:21:32,856
Just winding you up.
Why would you think

300
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,816
my children
would have a peculiar smell?

301
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:42,213
Berenice, you've been
a bit quiet.

302
00:21:42,388 --> 00:21:43,998
I hope we haven't
bored you too much.

303
00:21:44,172 --> 00:21:46,392
Oh, not at all.Maybe I should've made

304
00:21:46,566 --> 00:21:48,176
more of an effort
to draw you out, but I--

305
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,612
I sense you're someone

306
00:21:49,786 --> 00:21:51,745
not overly fond
of personal questions.

307
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,748
And why would that be?I don't know.

308
00:21:54,922 --> 00:21:58,055
Just a hunch. Maybe I'm wrong.

309
00:21:58,229 --> 00:22:00,623
Where are you from?Duluth.

310
00:22:00,797 --> 00:22:02,930
Minnesota?Mm-hm.

311
00:22:03,104 --> 00:22:05,324
The Art Institute there,
they used to have

312
00:22:05,498 --> 00:22:08,109
a really lovely
Toulouse-Lautrec, but no more.

313
00:22:08,283 --> 00:22:11,155
When I say Duluth, I mean
a small town south of the city.

314
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,288
Which one?

315
00:22:13,462 --> 00:22:14,942
It's quite small, Mr. Cassidy.

316
00:22:15,116 --> 00:22:16,509
I'm sure
you've never heard of it.

317
00:22:16,683 --> 00:22:18,249
Oh, of course not.

318
00:22:18,424 --> 00:22:21,122
Nice to be from a small town
though, isn't it?

319
00:22:21,296 --> 00:22:24,473
How so?Well, you venture into the world

320
00:22:24,647 --> 00:22:29,173
like a newborn,
free to be whomever you choose.

321
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:33,700
You know, neither of you have
mentioned the empty chair.

322
00:22:33,874 --> 00:22:35,658
I assumed
that was for your wife.

323
00:22:35,832 --> 00:22:38,792
What if I told you that,
at the edge of my property,

324
00:22:38,966 --> 00:22:41,011
there's a dilapidated
little house,

325
00:22:41,185 --> 00:22:43,274
and in this house there's a man

326
00:22:43,449 --> 00:22:45,712
who I invite
for lunch every day,

327
00:22:45,886 --> 00:22:50,891
and the only response I ever get
from him is this empty chair?

328
00:22:51,065 --> 00:22:52,414
Who is it?

329
00:22:52,588 --> 00:22:55,504
This man, my dear young friend,

330
00:22:55,678 --> 00:22:57,288
is the reason
that I summoned you here.

331
00:22:59,116 --> 00:23:01,118
I don't understand.

332
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:04,644
Rodolfo, let's have coffee
on the terrace, shall we?

333
00:23:04,818 --> 00:23:06,123
Very well, sir.

334
00:23:12,782 --> 00:23:15,437
If you could interview
any living artist,

335
00:23:15,611 --> 00:23:17,483
who do you think it would be?

336
00:23:17,657 --> 00:23:20,442
Anselm Kiefer.
Kiefer?

337
00:23:20,616 --> 00:23:23,967
Kiefer will speak to anyone
with an open notebook, I think.

338
00:23:24,141 --> 00:23:27,493
No, put yourself in a bit
more rarefied company, okay?

339
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:31,671
Uh...No critic has spoken to this guy

340
00:23:31,845 --> 00:23:33,803
in over 50 years.

341
00:23:33,977 --> 00:23:35,718
It's been that long
since anyone's even seen

342
00:23:35,892 --> 00:23:37,590
this man's work.

343
00:23:37,764 --> 00:23:39,853
Still not with you.Okay.

344
00:23:40,027 --> 00:23:41,332
If I say to you:

345
00:23:41,507 --> 00:23:43,596
Paris, 1968.

346
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:47,469
Twelve paintings gone up
in flames in a gallery fire.

347
00:23:47,643 --> 00:23:50,385
You're fucking with me.Mm.

348
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,649
Two days later,
on the same smoke-stained walls,

349
00:23:53,823 --> 00:23:56,347
an empty picture frame appears.

350
00:23:56,522 --> 00:23:59,133
A little notecard by it,
which read:

351
00:23:59,307 --> 00:24:01,222
"Jerome Debney. Number One."

352
00:24:01,396 --> 00:24:02,528
Oh, yeah, my college roommate

353
00:24:02,702 --> 00:24:04,355
had a poster of that
on her wall.

354
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,532
You're really saying
Jerome Debney is here?

355
00:24:06,706 --> 00:24:08,447
What was the last
you heard of him?

356
00:24:08,621 --> 00:24:10,274
Another fire, about a year ago,

357
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,146
in his studio
and house in France.

358
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,757
Everything burned down.
Uh, he lost everything.

359
00:24:14,931 --> 00:24:16,542
A lifetime's work went up
in flames,

360
00:24:16,716 --> 00:24:18,195
and no one ever got to see it.

361
00:24:18,369 --> 00:24:20,850
Gone. As if it never existed.

362
00:24:21,024 --> 00:24:22,722
He is not a wealthy man,

363
00:24:22,896 --> 00:24:24,593
gets all his money
from a charitable trust.

364
00:24:24,767 --> 00:24:26,203
The Debney Trust.Yeah.

365
00:24:26,377 --> 00:24:28,771
Upon whose board
I'm very honored to sit.

366
00:24:28,945 --> 00:24:30,643
And in that capacity,
I'm to offer

367
00:24:30,817 --> 00:24:33,428
the great man accommodations.

368
00:24:33,602 --> 00:24:37,476
So now every morning,
I got Jerome bloody Debney

369
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:39,565
sunning himself beside my pool.

370
00:24:41,654 --> 00:24:44,134
Uh, Rodolfo?Sir?

371
00:24:44,308 --> 00:24:47,921
What was Mr. Debney reading when
you picked him up the other day?

372
00:24:48,095 --> 00:24:50,010
Flash Art,sir.
The March issue.

373
00:24:50,184 --> 00:24:51,315
Mm.Mr. Figueras' column.

374
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,143
Oh, you're kidding me.

375
00:24:53,317 --> 00:24:55,450
And what was he doing
while he was reading it?

376
00:24:55,624 --> 00:24:57,278
Chuckling, sir.
He said:

377
00:24:57,452 --> 00:24:59,846
"This young man
is quite amusing."

378
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,370
Berenice, would you mind
if I borrow James

379
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:04,503
for a little
private conversation?

380
00:25:06,026 --> 00:25:07,506
No.

381
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,512
I employ a team of investigators

382
00:25:13,686 --> 00:25:16,819
to ensure authenticity
and chain of title.

383
00:25:16,993 --> 00:25:18,517
I see.

384
00:25:18,691 --> 00:25:21,302
One of them came across
a recent piece by you

385
00:25:21,476 --> 00:25:22,999
on Modigliani's brushstrokes.

386
00:25:23,173 --> 00:25:25,567
Do you remember that? Yes, of course.

387
00:25:25,741 --> 00:25:27,917
Rather interesting thesis.

388
00:25:28,091 --> 00:25:30,441
Helped me overcome
some uncertainty

389
00:25:30,616 --> 00:25:33,488
over a particular
Modigliani provenance,

390
00:25:33,662 --> 00:25:36,752
Woman with a Red Scarf.

391
00:25:36,926 --> 00:25:39,233
We made a rather profitable sale
to the Tate.

392
00:25:39,407 --> 00:25:41,496
Oh, it's in the Tate now.

393
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:44,325
Yeah, it kind of sparked
my curiosity though.

394
00:25:44,499 --> 00:25:45,674
So I had my people do

395
00:25:45,848 --> 00:25:47,676
a bit more digging. Mm-hm.

396
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,983
You were quite the boy wonder,
weren't you, James?

397
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,900
Reading your old articles,

398
00:25:54,074 --> 00:25:56,511
one would've thought you'd be
running a museum by now.

399
00:25:56,685 --> 00:25:58,731
Yeah, well...What happened, James?

400
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:03,387
Embezzlement, right?

401
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:06,216
Well, that makes it sound
like something it wasn't.

402
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:09,132
Mm. What was it then?

403
00:26:09,306 --> 00:26:12,614
The gallery had an account
for incidental expenses,

404
00:26:12,788 --> 00:26:15,182
and I thought
it would be all right to...

405
00:26:15,356 --> 00:26:18,185
borrow a small amount
and then repay it.

406
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:21,318
Sounds like something
pretty easy to sort out.

407
00:26:21,492 --> 00:26:23,843
I didn't handle
that situation very well.

408
00:26:24,017 --> 00:26:26,410
I had more of a temper
back then.

409
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,935
Oh, did you? Hm.

410
00:26:29,109 --> 00:26:31,198
Matured with age, have you?

411
00:26:32,808 --> 00:26:34,680
What is this about, Mr. Cassidy?

412
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:38,509
Redemption.

413
00:26:38,684 --> 00:26:41,730
Think of the splash
it would make.

414
00:26:41,904 --> 00:26:45,604
The first critic to interview
Jerome Debney in over 50 years,

415
00:26:45,778 --> 00:26:50,173
to see and describe
his current work, and, uh...

416
00:26:50,347 --> 00:26:53,960
You know, I could pull
quite a few strings,

417
00:26:54,134 --> 00:26:57,616
and you could be running
a major museum soon.

418
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:00,531
And why would you
do this for me?

419
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:06,276
I'd value a Debney, James,

420
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:09,932
and I'd like you
to procure one for me.

421
00:27:10,106 --> 00:27:11,630
How am I supposed to do that?

422
00:27:11,804 --> 00:27:13,327
Well, that's a transaction

423
00:27:13,501 --> 00:27:15,416
between you and Mr. Debney,
isn't it?

424
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,766
Yes, but what's to keep me
from doing the interview

425
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,463
without getting you
the painting?

426
00:27:23,467 --> 00:27:27,907
Did someone pay you to write
that Modigliani article?

427
00:27:28,081 --> 00:27:31,824
A man called Charles Clay?

428
00:27:31,998 --> 00:27:34,304
Charles Clay sold me  Woman with the Red Scarf.

429
00:27:38,526 --> 00:27:41,529
Did you know you were helping
to validate a forgery?

430
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:43,836
Or were you duped as well?

431
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:47,666
It's not a forgery.Hm.

432
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,800
Anyway, be the end of your
fucking career, wouldn't it?

433
00:27:58,328 --> 00:27:59,721
You sold it to the Tate.

434
00:27:59,895 --> 00:28:01,810
Well, I know, but I rely

435
00:28:01,984 --> 00:28:04,900
on the expertise of scholars
in these matters.

436
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:07,120
Anyway...

437
00:28:08,991 --> 00:28:10,427
I'm off to London
tomorrow morning,

438
00:28:10,601 --> 00:28:13,387
so, uh, you and Berenice
can have the run of the place.

439
00:28:13,561 --> 00:28:15,781
See what you can manage.

440
00:28:47,377 --> 00:28:48,857
Want one?

441
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:52,948
You got a habit, captain?

442
00:28:53,122 --> 00:28:54,907
Just a little boost
now and then.

443
00:28:55,081 --> 00:28:57,300
How many a day?Who's counting?

444
00:28:59,085 --> 00:29:01,957
Where I'm from,
that's called a habit.

445
00:29:02,131 --> 00:29:03,959
Duluth, huh?

446
00:29:05,569 --> 00:29:08,224
Thought there was an accent. A Duluth accent?

447
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:12,185
Minnesota. Something weird
with the vowels.

448
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:14,840
I thought all addicts
were hapless losers.

449
00:29:15,014 --> 00:29:16,929
Whoa, are we fighting?

450
00:29:17,103 --> 00:29:18,887
Only if you want to.Our first squabble.

451
00:29:19,061 --> 00:29:20,541
Okay, bring it on.
Call me a name.

452
00:29:20,715 --> 00:29:22,412
Asshole.
Mm!

453
00:29:22,586 --> 00:29:23,936
Put effort into it.

454
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:26,199
Bastard.

455
00:29:26,373 --> 00:29:29,985
Son of a bitch, piece of shit,
motherfucker, cocksucker.

456
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,033
Say something bad about
my character and make it sting.

457
00:29:34,207 --> 00:29:36,949
You treat serious things
as if they were trivial

458
00:29:37,123 --> 00:29:39,908
and trivial things
as if they were serious.

459
00:29:40,082 --> 00:29:42,389
Come on.
You have one more go,

460
00:29:42,563 --> 00:29:44,695
then I will show you
how it's done.

461
00:29:46,262 --> 00:29:47,698
How many days
you think I got left?

462
00:29:47,873 --> 00:29:49,918
Left?
To live.

463
00:29:51,746 --> 00:29:53,443
I mean, what kind
of question is that?

464
00:29:53,617 --> 00:29:55,576
There's a number, right?
For both of us.

465
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,708
Days, hours, minutes.

466
00:29:57,883 --> 00:30:00,363
After this minute right here,
one less.

467
00:30:00,537 --> 00:30:03,062
That's how it works. So why waste it like this?

468
00:30:08,284 --> 00:30:10,460
We're friends, right?

469
00:30:10,634 --> 00:30:11,940
The best.

470
00:30:12,114 --> 00:30:14,595
So who gives a fuck
where I'm from?

471
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,240
I can mail that for you, ma'am.Oh.

472
00:31:34,414 --> 00:31:36,720
If you like. Yeah, that'd be great.

473
00:31:39,245 --> 00:31:40,507
Thank you.

474
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:45,338
Morning, sir. Morning.

475
00:31:45,512 --> 00:31:47,601
Have you got a pen pal,
sugarplum?

476
00:31:47,775 --> 00:31:49,472
Just my mama.

477
00:31:49,646 --> 00:31:51,648
Back in old Duluth?

478
00:31:51,822 --> 00:31:54,086
Had to tell her I met a boy.

479
00:31:57,654 --> 00:31:59,395
Not a word.

480
00:32:01,571 --> 00:32:02,703
Watch.

481
00:32:20,199 --> 00:32:22,679
Good one.Very good one.

482
00:32:22,853 --> 00:32:24,768
Man of many skills.

483
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,379
That's right.

484
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,079
I had the weirdest dream
last night.

485
00:32:31,253 --> 00:32:33,690
Weird is how they generally come
in my experience.

486
00:32:33,864 --> 00:32:35,910
I woke up real early.
Mm-hm.

487
00:32:36,084 --> 00:32:38,652
Uh, heard someone whispering,
so I went to the door,

488
00:32:38,826 --> 00:32:40,523
cracked it open...Mm-hm.

489
00:32:40,697 --> 00:32:42,351
...and there you were,

490
00:32:42,525 --> 00:32:44,527
down the corridor
in a robe with Cassidy,

491
00:32:44,701 --> 00:32:49,402
and he gave you an envelope,
a thick one.

492
00:32:49,576 --> 00:32:53,972
Hm. And here I was
thinking flying horses,

493
00:32:54,146 --> 00:32:56,452
sex with your mother,
that kind of weird.

494
00:32:56,626 --> 00:32:58,628
I went back to bed
and lay there wondering:

495
00:32:58,802 --> 00:33:02,763
"Why would Cassidy give her
an envelope full of cash?"

496
00:33:02,937 --> 00:33:05,374
"Her" being me.

497
00:33:11,076 --> 00:33:13,382
This is a dream
we're talking about, right?

498
00:33:13,556 --> 00:33:15,863
Is it?

499
00:33:16,037 --> 00:33:17,821
You're a funny one, aren't you?

500
00:33:32,097 --> 00:33:33,837
Oh, look.

501
00:33:36,579 --> 00:33:39,060
We'll tell our grandchildren
about this.

502
00:33:41,671 --> 00:33:43,847
I came here a pauper,
but I'll leave a prince,

503
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:44,892
a fucking emperor.

504
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:47,068
I saw blue once.

505
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,073
Genuine blue, you understand.

506
00:33:53,509 --> 00:33:55,337
Platonic blue.

507
00:33:56,991 --> 00:33:59,211
In a pool much like this.

508
00:34:00,908 --> 00:34:02,953
I was underwater,

509
00:34:03,128 --> 00:34:06,609
staring upwards at the sky.

510
00:34:06,783 --> 00:34:12,224
And perhaps it was merely
a deficit of oxygen.

511
00:34:14,269 --> 00:34:16,141
But for a moment...

512
00:34:17,272 --> 00:34:18,534
blue.

513
00:34:21,102 --> 00:34:24,497
I've been searching for it
ever since.

514
00:34:26,803 --> 00:34:29,284
Mr. Figueras,

515
00:34:29,458 --> 00:34:30,981
I thought it might be you.

516
00:34:32,287 --> 00:34:33,549
You've shaved your beard.

517
00:34:34,768 --> 00:34:35,682
You must grow it back.

518
00:34:35,856 --> 00:34:37,553
It adds character.

519
00:34:39,816 --> 00:34:41,601
Honored, Mr. Debney.

520
00:34:41,775 --> 00:34:43,690
And startled.
How did you, um...?

521
00:34:43,864 --> 00:34:47,868
Your column, every month,
with its little photo.

522
00:34:48,042 --> 00:34:50,436
Oh, it's a fine thing
to see a young man

523
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:52,481
with such a clear eye.

524
00:34:52,655 --> 00:34:53,917
And your beautiful friend,

525
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,919
you hope to protect her
from my charm.

526
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,922
She has a name, I assume? Ms. Berenice Hollis.

527
00:35:01,534 --> 00:35:04,537
Jerome Debney.
At your service, Ms. Hollis.

528
00:35:04,711 --> 00:35:06,539
It's an honor, Mr. Debney.

529
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,976
Please.

530
00:35:11,152 --> 00:35:13,850
May I be direct,
in the modern way?

531
00:35:14,024 --> 00:35:15,678
Mr. Cassidy has
brought us together.

532
00:35:15,852 --> 00:35:17,332
Why, it doesn't matter.

533
00:35:17,506 --> 00:35:19,726
He's a collector.

534
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:23,643
And collectors, as we both know,
are odd creatures.

535
00:35:23,817 --> 00:35:26,124
I assume an arrangement
has been forged,

536
00:35:26,298 --> 00:35:28,387
an agreement
that suits you both.

537
00:35:28,561 --> 00:35:30,650
I don't really wish
to know, no.

538
00:35:30,824 --> 00:35:32,913
One of the great pleasures
in being an artist

539
00:35:33,087 --> 00:35:38,310
is that one need not traffic
with the world in this fashion.

540
00:35:38,484 --> 00:35:41,530
I presume that you would
like an interview.

541
00:35:41,704 --> 00:35:44,229
Tape recorder spinning away.

542
00:35:46,013 --> 00:35:47,797
I cannot abide such things.

543
00:35:48,972 --> 00:35:50,539
A conversation?

544
00:35:50,713 --> 00:35:53,847
Natural, informal.

545
00:35:54,021 --> 00:35:57,590
This, perhaps, might be
possible. Nothing more.

546
00:35:57,764 --> 00:35:59,853
Would such an approach
assuage you?

547
00:36:00,027 --> 00:36:01,898
That would mean the world to me.

548
00:36:02,072 --> 00:36:05,075
The holy grail.
Be the greatest honor.

549
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,990
But should it come so easily?

550
00:36:08,644 --> 00:36:09,863
Excuse me?

551
00:36:10,037 --> 00:36:11,604
What have you suffered?

552
00:36:11,778 --> 00:36:14,084
The King invites you
to his palace.

553
00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:16,739
You sun yourselves by his pool.

554
00:36:16,913 --> 00:36:19,525
The Grail approaches
and presents itself.

555
00:36:19,699 --> 00:36:22,528
No battles, no trials.

556
00:36:22,702 --> 00:36:24,530
The Gods would never approve.

557
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:27,533
Mr. Debney,
it was merely a metaphor.

558
00:36:27,707 --> 00:36:29,709
What power lurks in metaphors.

559
00:36:29,883 --> 00:36:32,277
Are you a swimmer? I think--

560
00:36:32,451 --> 00:36:36,237
One length, underwater,
and I'll speak with you.

561
00:36:36,411 --> 00:36:38,674
But, Mr. Debney, I--Two lengths.

562
00:36:38,848 --> 00:36:40,720
If your next word
is anything but "yes,"

563
00:36:40,894 --> 00:36:42,635
it'll be four lengths.

564
00:36:44,854 --> 00:36:46,247
Very well.

565
00:36:48,641 --> 00:36:50,686
My mother taught me
how to haggle.

566
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,735
If you have nothing to lose,
you must be merciless.

567
00:36:57,084 --> 00:36:58,259
Come.

568
00:36:58,433 --> 00:36:59,565
Sit beside me

569
00:36:59,739 --> 00:37:01,262
and we'll cheer him on together.

570
00:37:03,917 --> 00:37:07,007
I didn't expect you
to be so sociable, Mr. Debney.

571
00:37:07,181 --> 00:37:08,748
One of the things I've learned

572
00:37:08,922 --> 00:37:11,446
in my long stay
upon this darkling plane,

573
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,666
most things, most people,

574
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,450
they are not what you'd expect.

575
00:37:20,455 --> 00:37:23,763
Are you what one might expect?

576
00:37:23,937 --> 00:37:25,547
What might that be?

577
00:37:25,721 --> 00:37:26,505
A stone.

578
00:37:27,941 --> 00:37:29,464
Perhaps an egg.

579
00:37:31,118 --> 00:37:32,946
The question being,

580
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,905
how deep the hardness goes.

581
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,168
We'd need to drop you
to know for certain.

582
00:37:39,387 --> 00:37:41,520
Bravo! Halfway!

583
00:37:43,217 --> 00:37:45,524
You're old friends? Freshly minted.

584
00:37:45,698 --> 00:37:48,788
Hm. He is
an ambitious young man.

585
00:37:48,962 --> 00:37:51,356
So if you are an egg,

586
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,401
I hope you'll be careful.

587
00:37:53,575 --> 00:37:55,403
Trust me, I'm anything
but an egg.

588
00:37:55,577 --> 00:37:58,232
Do you know
the saddest egg of all?

589
00:37:58,406 --> 00:38:00,626
The egg that believes
it's a stone.

590
00:38:02,845 --> 00:38:06,414
Is there anything I might say
that could dissuade you

591
00:38:06,588 --> 00:38:09,374
from writing about me
in your magazine?

592
00:38:12,246 --> 00:38:14,640
I suspected as much.

593
00:38:14,814 --> 00:38:16,468
I go now
where you are not welcome

594
00:38:16,642 --> 00:38:18,818
to my studio for three hours.

595
00:38:18,992 --> 00:38:20,472
After that, a boat ride,

596
00:38:20,646 --> 00:38:23,475
and you're welcome
to accompany me if you wish.

597
00:38:23,649 --> 00:38:25,825
After the boat ride, a shower

598
00:38:25,999 --> 00:38:27,783
and then dinner.

599
00:38:27,957 --> 00:38:29,785
For which you are also welcome.

600
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:33,180
The meal, not the shower.

601
00:38:33,354 --> 00:38:34,442
Is that acceptable?

602
00:38:40,187 --> 00:38:42,276
Such sweet sorrow.

603
00:38:48,761 --> 00:38:51,590
Did you find
my blue under there?

604
00:38:54,462 --> 00:38:56,029
You okay, champ?

605
00:39:11,784 --> 00:39:15,222
How did you end up
with such a pretty name?

606
00:39:15,396 --> 00:39:17,790
Waiting for me when I arrived.

607
00:39:17,964 --> 00:39:20,923
Doesn't strike me
as a common choice in Minnesota.

608
00:39:21,097 --> 00:39:22,272
Gonna dance
to this tune again?

609
00:39:22,447 --> 00:39:25,145
Tell me.

610
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:28,453
My mother bet my Aunt Sally
that I'd be a girl.

611
00:39:28,627 --> 00:39:31,151
Which I am,
as you maybe noticed.

612
00:39:31,325 --> 00:39:34,459
So "Berenice,"
bringer of victory.

613
00:39:34,633 --> 00:39:36,809
What did they bet?

614
00:39:36,983 --> 00:39:39,942
A new set of pickling jars. Oh, you're good.

615
00:39:40,116 --> 00:39:42,249
Lying's easy
when you tell the truth.

616
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:47,297
It's the quirky details
that carry the day.

617
00:39:47,472 --> 00:39:49,299
Aunt Sally, pickling jars.

618
00:39:49,474 --> 00:39:51,389
Nils vowing
never to touch a brush again,

619
00:39:51,563 --> 00:39:54,783
Nora dying of consumption.

620
00:39:54,957 --> 00:39:56,481
Want to know about Nora?
Ask Debney.

621
00:39:56,655 --> 00:39:59,571
He probably met her in Paris.

622
00:39:59,745 --> 00:40:02,661
Oh! Almost time
for our boat ride.

623
00:40:02,835 --> 00:40:05,446
Hm?

624
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,317
You're on your own for that.

625
00:40:07,492 --> 00:40:09,407
If I don't rest,
I can't make dinner.

626
00:40:12,932 --> 00:40:13,585
What?

627
00:40:16,196 --> 00:40:18,546
We're not supposed to talk
about it. That's the deal?

628
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,200
It's not so complicated,
honeybunch.

629
00:40:20,374 --> 00:40:21,854
I had a deadline,
the pills helped.

630
00:40:22,028 --> 00:40:23,421
Then I started needing more,

631
00:40:23,595 --> 00:40:25,292
then it wasn't
about the deadlines anymore.

632
00:40:25,466 --> 00:40:26,902
I can end it. I just--

633
00:40:27,076 --> 00:40:29,339
I'm just waiting
for the right moment.

634
00:40:29,514 --> 00:40:31,429
And I can certainly hear
how that sounds,

635
00:40:31,603 --> 00:40:33,431
and it's not like that.

636
00:40:38,261 --> 00:40:39,872
Yeah.

637
00:40:40,046 --> 00:40:42,309
You're probably right.
We shouldn't talk about it.

638
00:40:59,544 --> 00:41:01,154
Where is our Galahad?

639
00:41:01,328 --> 00:41:04,070
Resting. He sends his regrets.

640
00:41:05,898 --> 00:41:09,205
I wore him out, didn't I?
With our little escapade.

641
00:41:09,379 --> 00:41:11,512
Where are you taking me?

642
00:41:11,686 --> 00:41:15,429
Come away, O human child! To the waters and the wild

643
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:34,421
Did you know a woman
named Nora Ingen?

644
00:42:38,381 --> 00:42:39,557
Nora.

645
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:45,737
The beautiful and broken Nora.

646
00:42:49,784 --> 00:42:52,308
What do you know of her?

647
00:42:52,482 --> 00:42:55,181
Only what James told me.

648
00:42:55,355 --> 00:42:56,748
The concentration camps,

649
00:42:56,922 --> 00:42:59,272
her brother painting
the Germans,

650
00:42:59,446 --> 00:43:00,621
the flies.

651
00:43:00,795 --> 00:43:02,623
Flies?

652
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:06,584
A fairy tale.

653
00:43:06,758 --> 00:43:08,890
To give meaning
where there was none.

654
00:43:09,064 --> 00:43:11,284
It's not true?

655
00:43:11,458 --> 00:43:14,722
The camps were not a place
where paintings were made.

656
00:43:14,896 --> 00:43:18,596
The idea of such a thing,
it's obscene.

657
00:43:20,685 --> 00:43:23,644
Nils died like all the others.

658
00:43:23,818 --> 00:43:26,473
Packed into a narrow room.

659
00:43:26,647 --> 00:43:27,953
Gassed.

660
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,607
How do you know?

661
00:43:31,739 --> 00:43:34,612
She told me.
Nora?

662
00:43:34,786 --> 00:43:37,919
We were not very good to her,
the men in my circle.

663
00:43:38,093 --> 00:43:41,053
We passed her around
like a talisman,

664
00:43:41,227 --> 00:43:43,577
daring ourselves to kiss

665
00:43:43,751 --> 00:43:46,754
the tiny numbers tattooed
on her forearm.

666
00:43:48,582 --> 00:43:50,540
We were callow

667
00:43:50,715 --> 00:43:52,717
when we should've been kind.

668
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:58,113
Now you know
the worst of Jerome Debney.

669
00:43:59,506 --> 00:44:01,595
We're still friends?

670
00:44:01,769 --> 00:44:03,858
Of course, Mr. Debney.

671
00:44:04,032 --> 00:44:06,600
We'll always be friends.Oh, wonderful.

672
00:44:06,774 --> 00:44:08,167
Wonderful.

673
00:45:52,314 --> 00:45:54,752
A favorite spot of mine.

674
00:45:54,926 --> 00:45:57,537
One must labor to apprehend it.

675
00:45:57,711 --> 00:45:59,757
And those surely don't help.

676
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:04,805
I try to think of them
as regrets.

677
00:46:04,979 --> 00:46:07,199
One can either feel tormented

678
00:46:08,896 --> 00:46:11,246
or learn
to endure their presence.

679
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:14,554
I obviously carry mine
less gracefully than you.

680
00:46:14,728 --> 00:46:17,122
Well, then you must
tell me a secret.

681
00:46:17,296 --> 00:46:20,778
Something shameful.
It will ease your burden.

682
00:46:24,694 --> 00:46:25,957
I'm a teacher.

683
00:46:26,131 --> 00:46:28,786
And a fine one, I'm sure.

684
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,092
I made a mistake.What sort?

685
00:46:31,266 --> 00:46:33,529
An indiscretion
with a colleague.

686
00:46:33,703 --> 00:46:34,443
Married, I assume?

687
00:46:38,665 --> 00:46:41,102
Every year, I have
the freshmen girls for health.

688
00:46:41,276 --> 00:46:42,930
Uh-huh.The facts of life,

689
00:46:43,104 --> 00:46:44,889
that kind of thing.

690
00:46:45,063 --> 00:46:47,892
How not to get pregnant.

691
00:46:48,066 --> 00:46:51,025
The teacher was
not such a good student?

692
00:46:53,332 --> 00:46:55,638
Officially, I'm on leave
to have a cyst removed.

693
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:56,901
Ah.

694
00:46:58,032 --> 00:46:59,729
I have a friend, a best friend.

695
00:46:59,904 --> 00:47:02,776
She's older, married.

696
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:04,560
Before I left,
I told her everything,

697
00:47:04,734 --> 00:47:07,215
and there was this moment
when I was talking,

698
00:47:07,389 --> 00:47:09,522
and she gave me this look--

699
00:47:09,696 --> 00:47:11,741
It was just a flash,
you know, reflexive.

700
00:47:11,916 --> 00:47:13,439
--like she wanted to spit on me.

701
00:47:15,136 --> 00:47:18,748
It stung. Keeps stinging.

702
00:47:18,923 --> 00:47:22,274
So when I got to Italy,
I thought, "Why not?

703
00:47:22,448 --> 00:47:25,190
Play the whore
for a little while.

704
00:47:25,364 --> 00:47:26,756
See how it feels."

705
00:47:26,931 --> 00:47:28,584
And does it suit you?

706
00:47:28,758 --> 00:47:29,455
This new mask?

707
00:47:32,153 --> 00:47:33,851
Turns out, I'm all right at it.

708
00:47:34,025 --> 00:47:36,201
You have to be careful, my dear.

709
00:47:36,375 --> 00:47:38,420
A mask can be a perilous thing.

710
00:47:38,594 --> 00:47:41,684
When I take mine off at night,
another waits beneath.

711
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,208
And under that?

712
00:47:44,992 --> 00:47:47,473
So many years, Ms. Hollis.

713
00:47:47,647 --> 00:47:49,344
Decades.

714
00:47:49,518 --> 00:47:53,218
And it's masks
all the way down by now.

715
00:47:58,571 --> 00:47:59,964
And you?

716
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:03,402
Is there anything left?

717
00:48:07,754 --> 00:48:09,190
I think so.

718
00:48:09,364 --> 00:48:10,931
Then it's not too late, is it?

719
00:50:25,674 --> 00:50:27,111
James?

720
00:50:32,464 --> 00:50:34,596
Sky's still standing,
Chicken Little.

721
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:37,425
Just slipped on the stairs.

722
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:41,212
Tell Papa all about
the boat ride.

723
00:50:41,386 --> 00:50:45,042
I think I lost
3 pounds to mosquitoes.

724
00:50:45,216 --> 00:50:47,914
But I like him.
He's a fine old man.

725
00:50:48,088 --> 00:50:49,742
What did you
two lovebirds talk about?

726
00:50:49,916 --> 00:50:51,439
This and that.Not the other thing?

727
00:50:52,919 --> 00:50:54,703
Never on a first date.

728
00:50:54,877 --> 00:50:56,314
What kind of girl
you take me for?

729
00:50:58,794 --> 00:51:00,535
Seemed to think
I should tell you the truth.

730
00:51:00,709 --> 00:51:02,363
About what?
Myself.

731
00:51:02,537 --> 00:51:05,932
Oh! And what would that be?

732
00:51:06,106 --> 00:51:08,717
Small-town girl, made a mistake.

733
00:51:08,891 --> 00:51:11,807
In way over her head, paddling
about with sharks like you.

734
00:51:13,461 --> 00:51:16,769
Little Bo-Peep, huh?Pretty much.

735
00:51:16,943 --> 00:51:19,163
Tell it to Aunt Sally.

736
00:51:32,219 --> 00:51:34,265
Aren't you the little lady?

737
00:51:34,439 --> 00:51:36,571
Bit late for that, turns out.

738
00:51:36,745 --> 00:51:38,573
Did I miss any local sights?

739
00:51:38,747 --> 00:51:40,662
He took me to some ruins.

740
00:51:40,836 --> 00:51:43,404
Just up the lake? Just outside the property.

741
00:51:43,578 --> 00:51:45,624
Felt like the first person
to set foot there

742
00:51:45,798 --> 00:51:47,800
in a hundred years.
It scares me to think of him

743
00:51:47,974 --> 00:51:49,628
out there alone, though,
on the water.

744
00:51:49,802 --> 00:51:50,803
Why?

745
00:51:52,544 --> 00:51:55,199
He capsizes,
no one will ever find him.

746
00:51:55,373 --> 00:51:57,549
Probably what he wants,
vanish without a trace.

747
00:51:57,723 --> 00:51:59,768
Be the perfect close
to his legend.

748
00:51:59,942 --> 00:52:03,250
Nobody wants to end up
at the bottom of a lake, chief.

749
00:52:05,557 --> 00:52:06,601
Could you...?

750
00:52:09,561 --> 00:52:10,736
Thank you.

751
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:13,608
Do me a favor?What are friends for?

752
00:52:13,782 --> 00:52:15,393
Tonight,
when we're at his house,

753
00:52:15,567 --> 00:52:18,352
I need to take a photo
of whatever he's working on.

754
00:52:18,526 --> 00:52:19,962
Can you distract him
a bit, please?

755
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:22,487
Why?There's no way he's ever gonna--

756
00:52:22,661 --> 00:52:24,358
Why do you need
to take a picture?

757
00:52:24,532 --> 00:52:27,579
For my work,
for my writing, reference.

758
00:52:27,753 --> 00:52:30,103
Seems kind of underhanded,
don't you think?

759
00:52:30,277 --> 00:52:32,236
Underhanded?

760
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:33,976
He's inviting us into his home.

761
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:36,109
It's a memory aid, Pollyanna.

762
00:52:36,283 --> 00:52:39,068
I'll delete it when I'm done.

763
00:52:39,243 --> 00:52:42,681
What makes you think he's gonna
show you anything anyway?

764
00:52:42,855 --> 00:52:46,815
My irresistible charisma.

765
00:52:46,989 --> 00:52:48,948
No, Mr. Figueras.

766
00:52:49,122 --> 00:52:51,211
No, no, no.

767
00:52:51,385 --> 00:52:53,039
It's a ridicule.

768
00:52:53,213 --> 00:52:55,955
Why ruin
a pleasant evening?

769
00:52:56,129 --> 00:52:58,436
Let us finish our meal.

770
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:01,613
I'll pretend
you never raised the idea,

771
00:53:01,787 --> 00:53:03,049
and we'll all part as friends.

772
00:53:03,223 --> 00:53:05,878
You have a duty, Mr. Debney.

773
00:53:06,052 --> 00:53:08,707
To whom?Posterity.

774
00:53:08,881 --> 00:53:11,753
When you've departed,
the world will come rushing in.

775
00:53:11,927 --> 00:53:14,800
Wouldn't it be better
to share your work now, with me,

776
00:53:14,974 --> 00:53:16,758
while you're still here
to explain it?

777
00:53:16,932 --> 00:53:20,719
I can help you do this.
Together, we--

778
00:53:20,893 --> 00:53:24,897
What is the earliest example
of art you can think of?

779
00:53:25,071 --> 00:53:27,029
The caves, I suppose.
Lascaux, Altamira.

780
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:31,295
Mm. Odd place to paint,
wouldn't you agree?

781
00:53:31,469 --> 00:53:34,036
A hole in the ground?

782
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,474
Can you explain the impulse?

783
00:53:36,648 --> 00:53:39,041
Well, it's a long way
from my field of expertise,

784
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:41,609
but I suppose there's some sort
of ritualized element here.

785
00:53:41,783 --> 00:53:45,918
I mean, the womb, Mother Earth,
a descent into--

786
00:53:46,092 --> 00:53:48,529
I have
a much simpler hypothesis.

787
00:53:48,703 --> 00:53:51,445
They had no desire
to share their work.

788
00:53:51,619 --> 00:53:55,188
They were hiding it from eyes
they considered unworthy.

789
00:53:55,362 --> 00:53:57,886
But I suppose you could also say
it was a way

790
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:02,108
of safeguarding the paintings
for future generations.

791
00:54:02,282 --> 00:54:03,892
After all,
their work was discovered,

792
00:54:04,066 --> 00:54:05,981
just as yours shall be.

793
00:54:06,155 --> 00:54:08,114
And I'll be there
to write of it, Mr. Debney,

794
00:54:08,288 --> 00:54:09,855
with you or without you.

795
00:54:17,776 --> 00:54:21,997
Oh, he's such
an earnest young man.

796
00:54:22,171 --> 00:54:26,828
To speak so seriously
of such foolish matters.

797
00:54:27,002 --> 00:54:30,615
Oh, nothing could be
less foolish.

798
00:54:30,789 --> 00:54:33,966
Huh. Come.
Let me show you my studio.

799
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:35,968
Are you serious?

800
00:54:36,142 --> 00:54:37,665
I think you'll be quite amused.

801
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:40,102
Both of us?
Everyone.

802
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:44,455
It's time. Past time.

803
00:54:44,629 --> 00:54:45,543
Take this.What?

804
00:54:45,717 --> 00:54:47,414
When I give you the nod,
drop it.

805
00:54:47,588 --> 00:54:49,373
What--?
Trust me.

806
00:54:51,592 --> 00:54:54,508
We have to be rather
fleet of foot, I'm afraid.

807
00:54:54,682 --> 00:54:57,903
I have a rendezvous this
evening. With a local widow.

808
00:54:58,077 --> 00:55:00,079
And I can write about this,
what you show us?

809
00:55:00,253 --> 00:55:01,515
You have my blessing.

810
00:55:01,689 --> 00:55:03,822
Indeed, I'll be rather intrigued

811
00:55:03,996 --> 00:55:05,780
to learn what you make of it.

812
00:55:05,954 --> 00:55:08,348
This is everything,
you understand.

813
00:55:08,522 --> 00:55:10,959
Nothing else exists.

814
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,849
This one has been quite tricky.
I'd value your insight.

815
00:55:32,198 --> 00:55:33,765
Too much blue?

816
00:55:35,897 --> 00:55:37,899
I don't understand. Those are finished.

817
00:55:38,073 --> 00:55:40,249
Uh, more or less.

818
00:55:40,424 --> 00:55:43,514
Though if the muse calls,
I return.

819
00:55:46,299 --> 00:55:48,257
But, Mr. Debney,
there's nothing here.

820
00:55:48,432 --> 00:55:49,607
No?

821
00:55:57,136 --> 00:55:58,485
The blue.

822
00:55:59,878 --> 00:56:02,446
I keep thinking too much.

823
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:04,404
Uh, Mr. Debney, I...

824
00:56:06,493 --> 00:56:08,277
You know of the fire,
the first,

825
00:56:08,452 --> 00:56:12,064
at the gallery in Paris? Yes, of course.

826
00:56:12,238 --> 00:56:16,460
For three weeks, the world
picked up Jerome Debney,

827
00:56:16,634 --> 00:56:21,073
turned him this way and that,
covered him with words.

828
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:24,642
I'll be honest, I thought
I was quite the success.

829
00:56:24,816 --> 00:56:28,036
A genius, even.You were. Are.

830
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:33,694
A carelessly
discarded cigarette.

831
00:56:33,868 --> 00:56:37,742
In less than an hour...
nothing.

832
00:56:37,916 --> 00:56:40,832
You would've thought I'd lost
a loved one, how I was treated.

833
00:56:41,006 --> 00:56:43,922
Letters of condolence,
mournful embraces.

834
00:56:45,706 --> 00:56:49,231
And yet, in my heart...

835
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:52,321
a great burden lifted.

836
00:56:52,496 --> 00:56:56,195
All those words,
all those opinions,

837
00:56:56,369 --> 00:56:59,067
that was the meaning
of the empty frame.

838
00:56:59,241 --> 00:57:00,329
It was a joke.

839
00:57:00,504 --> 00:57:03,332
Fill this with your chatter.

840
00:57:03,507 --> 00:57:05,726
And look how they did with it.

841
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:08,686
I've seen it on a T-shirt.Yeah.

842
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:10,862
From then on in,

843
00:57:11,036 --> 00:57:13,386
there was no one
who could make my work

844
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:16,520
anything other than what it was.

845
00:57:16,694 --> 00:57:19,044
It was Eden, Mr. Figueras.

846
00:57:19,218 --> 00:57:21,350
For nearly 50 years,

847
00:57:21,525 --> 00:57:24,179
I walked naked in the garden.

848
00:57:24,353 --> 00:57:25,616
And then one morning,

849
00:57:26,965 --> 00:57:29,184
I woke with a pain.

850
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:31,535
Here.

851
00:57:31,709 --> 00:57:33,145
It was nothing.

852
00:57:33,319 --> 00:57:35,713
Indigestion.

853
00:57:35,887 --> 00:57:38,846
But it reminded me
of the serpent.

854
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:42,284
The serpent that lurks
in all our gardens.

855
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:45,549
One day, Jerome Debney...

856
00:57:45,723 --> 00:57:48,943
will be no more.

857
00:57:49,117 --> 00:57:52,033
And the world,
as you so astutely put it,

858
00:57:52,207 --> 00:57:54,601
will come rushing in.

859
00:57:54,775 --> 00:57:57,386
You burned the villa.

860
00:57:57,561 --> 00:58:01,173
I wish you could've seen
the colors, my dear.

861
00:58:01,347 --> 00:58:04,002
The flames feeding on the paint.

862
00:58:04,176 --> 00:58:05,917
It was quite lovely,
I assure you.

863
00:58:06,091 --> 00:58:08,702
Jesus fucking Christ.

864
00:58:08,876 --> 00:58:09,877
Now...

865
00:58:11,444 --> 00:58:13,359
every morning...

866
00:58:13,533 --> 00:58:17,145
I take the palette, the brush,

867
00:58:17,319 --> 00:58:19,757
and I paint.

868
00:58:19,931 --> 00:58:21,498
Without the paint.

869
00:58:22,586 --> 00:58:25,893
I have become my own cave.

870
00:58:26,067 --> 00:58:29,114
A deep breath, young man.
It will pass.

871
00:58:29,288 --> 00:58:31,333
You're a thief.

872
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:34,989
Your work belongs to the world,
the entire fucking world,

873
00:58:35,163 --> 00:58:37,252
and you've stolen it.

874
00:58:37,426 --> 00:58:38,776
It's despicable.

875
00:58:40,604 --> 00:58:43,258
I think somehow
you might be right.

876
00:58:43,432 --> 00:58:47,132
The blue, it does seem
a little off somehow.

877
00:58:48,699 --> 00:58:49,700
Along the bottom, no?Right.

878
00:58:51,049 --> 00:58:53,530
You have an excellent eye.

879
00:58:53,704 --> 00:58:55,575
There's writing
on the back.

880
00:58:55,749 --> 00:58:57,621
When I'm truly finished,

881
00:58:57,795 --> 00:59:01,973
I scrawl the title,
the date and my initials.

882
00:59:02,147 --> 00:59:03,670
For posterity's sake,
you understand.

883
00:59:03,844 --> 00:59:05,977
"The Burnt Orange Heresy."

884
00:59:06,151 --> 00:59:08,414
A favorite. What does it mean?

885
00:59:08,588 --> 00:59:12,331
It's a bone tossed to the
critics, those ravenous dogs.

886
00:59:12,505 --> 00:59:14,812
They can wear themselves out
chewing on it.

887
00:59:14,986 --> 00:59:17,554
Searching for meaning
where there is none.

888
00:59:17,728 --> 00:59:21,819
Uh, I'll wait outside. Um...
I'm sorry, sir, but I-- I--

889
00:59:21,993 --> 00:59:23,429
I lack the stomach for this.

890
00:59:24,648 --> 00:59:26,519
James.

891
00:59:26,693 --> 00:59:30,305
Leave him.
He has wounds to lick.

892
00:59:58,507 --> 01:00:00,031
I'm afraid I must part ways

893
01:00:00,205 --> 01:00:01,641
with you here, my dear.

894
01:00:03,077 --> 01:00:05,340
If I tarry much longer,

895
01:00:05,514 --> 01:00:08,822
the widow will have
gone to sleep.

896
01:00:08,996 --> 01:00:11,564
I wish you much happiness,
my dear,

897
01:00:11,738 --> 01:00:14,959
and a long life
in which to enjoy it.

898
01:00:15,133 --> 01:00:18,049
It's been an honor
and an even greater pleasure.

899
01:00:20,312 --> 01:00:23,097
I know you're an unhappy
young man right now.

900
01:00:23,271 --> 01:00:26,623
But I believe in time,
you will understand.

901
01:00:26,797 --> 01:00:27,885
Yeah.

902
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:32,280
Good night.

903
01:01:07,272 --> 01:01:10,014
Still friends, partner?

904
01:01:10,188 --> 01:01:12,277
Hey, I'm sorry,
but that was a shock.

905
01:01:12,451 --> 01:01:16,107
Got your scoop, didn't you?
It's not the one you thought.

906
01:01:16,281 --> 01:01:17,456
Fuck.

907
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:19,023
What?I forgot my bag.

908
01:01:19,197 --> 01:01:21,765
Oh, I'll come with you. No, no, no. Wait. Um...

909
01:01:21,939 --> 01:01:23,810
Go pack and meet me by the car.

910
01:01:23,984 --> 01:01:25,899
The car?I need to write this now,

911
01:01:26,073 --> 01:01:27,684
and I can't do that here, so...

912
01:01:27,858 --> 01:01:29,337
Are you serious?Yes, I am serious.

913
01:01:29,511 --> 01:01:31,383
Please, do it.

914
01:01:31,557 --> 01:01:33,080
Promise, I'll make it up to you.

915
01:01:33,254 --> 01:01:34,212
Okay?

916
01:05:37,759 --> 01:05:39,892
What?

917
01:05:40,066 --> 01:05:42,373
Hey, train's leaving.
Get on it. Come on.

918
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:34,642
Embers, ashes, afterglow.

919
01:06:36,122 --> 01:06:37,994
Into the good night.

920
01:06:38,168 --> 01:06:40,431
Into the gentle night.

921
01:06:40,605 --> 01:06:44,130
Debney.
Embers, ashes, acceptance.

922
01:06:44,304 --> 01:06:46,915
Demurral and acceptance.

923
01:06:47,090 --> 01:06:52,051
Debney. Demurral and acceptance.

924
01:06:53,531 --> 01:06:55,881
Acting a little strange, boss.

925
01:06:57,317 --> 01:06:59,537
How long have you known me?

926
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:01,060
A few days.

927
01:07:02,757 --> 01:07:06,196
So how can you possibly say

928
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:08,850
what's strange
and what's normal?

929
01:07:19,644 --> 01:07:21,211
Home sweet home.

930
01:08:31,455 --> 01:08:33,892
Where are you going?Gotta get writing.

931
01:08:34,066 --> 01:08:35,894
Now?

932
01:08:36,068 --> 01:08:37,287
Well, when the muse calls...

933
01:08:38,853 --> 01:08:40,420
Come on, be a good girl.

934
01:11:27,065 --> 01:11:29,372
Mr. Cassidy.

935
01:11:29,546 --> 01:11:31,374
It seems there's been a fire
on my estate, James.

936
01:11:31,548 --> 01:11:33,506
Yes. Yes, sir.
That-- That's right.

937
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:37,118
That is right. Uh, Debney's studio?

938
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:39,599
Yes. Yes, I'm afraid so.

939
01:11:39,773 --> 01:11:42,298
Will you please assure me
that this happened

940
01:11:42,472 --> 01:11:44,517
after you procured the painting?

941
01:11:44,691 --> 01:11:46,214
It did. It did.

942
01:11:46,389 --> 01:11:48,434
So my painting

943
01:11:48,608 --> 01:11:51,916
is, uh, the only Debney
in existence, then. Right?

944
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:55,354
Uh, yes, I-- I suppose
you could say that, sir, yeah.

945
01:11:55,528 --> 01:11:57,400
And Debney, he's, uh...?

946
01:11:57,574 --> 01:11:59,532
He was away for the evening.

947
01:11:59,706 --> 01:12:02,274
I mean, how much more can he
really paint? I mean, he's old.

948
01:12:02,448 --> 01:12:03,797
He is old.

949
01:12:03,971 --> 01:12:06,539
Oh, send me a text of it,
can you?

950
01:12:06,713 --> 01:12:09,020
Uh, no, no, no. I can't do that.
It's in my car.

951
01:12:09,194 --> 01:12:11,239
It's hidden, and I can't risk
taking it out.

952
01:12:11,414 --> 01:12:14,330
Ms. Hollis is still with me.

953
01:12:14,504 --> 01:12:16,854
Well, can you describe it
to me, then?

954
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:21,598
Um...

955
01:12:21,772 --> 01:12:25,602
Well, it's-- It's kind of hard
to describe, to be honest.

956
01:12:25,776 --> 01:12:28,822
Well, it's your bloody job  describing pictures, isn't it?

957
01:12:34,524 --> 01:12:35,786
James?

958
01:12:38,049 --> 01:12:41,835
It's called
The Burnt Orange Heresy.

959
01:12:42,009 --> 01:12:43,184
It's orange?

960
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:45,230
It's burnt orange.

961
01:12:46,449 --> 01:12:47,972
Like the sun.

962
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:51,497
Like the setting sun.

963
01:12:53,194 --> 01:12:55,849
It's a self-portrait, really.
It is.

964
01:12:56,023 --> 01:12:57,416
It's, um...

965
01:12:57,590 --> 01:13:01,594
the artist,
alone in the empyrean,

966
01:13:01,768 --> 01:13:04,989
descending
toward a final horizon.

967
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,080
In full acceptance.

968
01:13:11,691 --> 01:13:14,825
That's fantastic, James.
Fantastic.

969
01:13:16,696 --> 01:13:17,610
Thank you, sir.

970
01:13:19,656 --> 01:13:21,048
Thank you.

971
01:14:36,384 --> 01:14:39,213
Tell me why this
isn't a terrible thing.

972
01:14:39,387 --> 01:14:42,956
It's not what it looks like. What does it look like?

973
01:14:43,130 --> 01:14:44,480
What does it look like, James?

974
01:14:44,654 --> 01:14:47,961
Listen to me for a second.

975
01:14:48,135 --> 01:14:51,835
That lecture
for those tourists, right?

976
01:14:52,009 --> 01:14:55,578
I do that 20, 30 times a year,
200 euros a pop,

977
01:14:55,752 --> 01:14:57,362
in Milan or Florence or Rome,

978
01:14:57,536 --> 01:14:59,799
and it's the same
blank-faced American tourists

979
01:14:59,973 --> 01:15:01,366
with the same
stupid fucking questions

980
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:02,846
about Raphael and da Vinci,

981
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:05,805
as if no one else
ever painted anything.

982
01:15:05,979 --> 01:15:08,547
Debney is stealing from me.
Yes, he is.

983
01:15:08,721 --> 01:15:10,331
And from you and from everybody.

984
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:12,072
This isn't who you are, slick.

985
01:15:12,246 --> 01:15:16,424
Pumpkin, you haven't
the slightest idea who I am.

986
01:15:17,948 --> 01:15:21,125
You know what we need to do.What?

987
01:15:21,299 --> 01:15:23,257
We need to get rid
of that awful painting.

988
01:15:23,431 --> 01:15:25,782
No. Don't you dare.Oh! Let go, James.

989
01:15:25,956 --> 01:15:27,523
Don't you dare.You're hurting me!

990
01:15:27,697 --> 01:15:29,437
Have you any idea
how valuable that is?

991
01:15:29,612 --> 01:15:32,484
That's the only Debney
in the world.

992
01:15:32,658 --> 01:15:34,138
Why is he paying you?

993
01:15:34,312 --> 01:15:35,966
Who?

994
01:15:36,140 --> 01:15:38,882
Cassidy. To spy on me?That was a dream.

995
01:15:39,056 --> 01:15:42,494
You said that was a dream.Please go tell him. Tell him.

996
01:15:42,668 --> 01:15:44,975
He won't believe you
because he wants it to be real.

997
01:15:45,149 --> 01:15:46,716
And it is real.

998
01:15:46,890 --> 01:15:48,761
Do you know
what's gonna happen now?

999
01:15:48,935 --> 01:15:51,459
You're gonna
get out of my apartment.

1000
01:15:51,634 --> 01:15:53,636
You're gonna
get out of my life and go back

1001
01:15:53,810 --> 01:15:55,855
to your cheap whoring
and sucking and fucking your--

1002
01:15:56,029 --> 01:15:58,205
We're through here. Motherfucker!

1003
01:16:30,237 --> 01:16:31,499
Fuck.

1004
01:18:23,786 --> 01:18:25,265
No, no, no. Come on.

1005
01:18:25,439 --> 01:18:26,919
Easy.

1006
01:18:28,007 --> 01:18:29,922
Easy.

1007
01:18:30,096 --> 01:18:31,054
Shh...

1008
01:18:33,752 --> 01:18:36,276
No, no, no.

1009
01:18:36,450 --> 01:18:37,364
Shh...

1010
01:18:42,195 --> 01:18:43,719
I'm really, really sorry.

1011
01:18:45,677 --> 01:18:48,462
It was an accident, okay?

1012
01:18:49,812 --> 01:18:50,987
You...

1013
01:18:52,553 --> 01:18:54,512
You scared me.

1014
01:18:56,601 --> 01:18:58,734
I know. I'm sorry.

1015
01:19:00,387 --> 01:19:02,085
You hurt me.

1016
01:19:03,564 --> 01:19:05,958
I didn't mean to.

1017
01:19:06,132 --> 01:19:09,832
It was an accident, okay?
It's over.

1018
01:19:11,311 --> 01:19:13,661
Okay? It's over.

1019
01:19:18,275 --> 01:19:20,364
I'm so, so sorry.

1020
01:19:28,198 --> 01:19:29,721
Can you stand up?

1021
01:19:31,636 --> 01:19:34,421
Get you back to the apartment.

1022
01:19:34,595 --> 01:19:35,858
Okay?

1023
01:19:37,294 --> 01:19:38,295
Mm-hm.

1024
01:19:39,731 --> 01:19:41,515
Give me your hand.

1025
01:19:48,871 --> 01:19:51,264
I'm so, so sorry.

1026
01:19:51,438 --> 01:19:52,875
Come here.

1027
01:19:55,094 --> 01:19:57,270
We're okay?

1028
01:19:57,444 --> 01:19:58,663
Come on.

1029
01:19:58,837 --> 01:20:00,491
You can do this.

1030
01:20:00,665 --> 01:20:02,319
It's gonna be fine.Mm.

1031
01:20:12,677 --> 01:20:15,767
I'm sorry.

1032
01:20:15,941 --> 01:20:18,465
You do know that, right?
How sorry I am.

1033
01:20:20,206 --> 01:20:21,817
Mm-hm.

1034
01:20:21,991 --> 01:20:23,949
I could buy you a plane ticket.

1035
01:20:25,690 --> 01:20:28,214
How will that sound?

1036
01:20:28,388 --> 01:20:30,651
First class,
anywhere you want to go.

1037
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:34,699
He's paying you. Cassidy.

1038
01:20:34,873 --> 01:20:38,094
Oh, no. No, no, no,
it's not like that.

1039
01:20:38,268 --> 01:20:41,227
He's letting me write about it.

1040
01:20:41,401 --> 01:20:43,186
It's actually the opportunity
of a lifetime,

1041
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:45,362
to take a Debney,
to be allowed--

1042
01:20:45,536 --> 01:20:47,190
It's not real, James.

1043
01:20:51,107 --> 01:20:53,283
It is so real.

1044
01:21:00,116 --> 01:21:02,858
Please get dressed.

1045
01:21:03,032 --> 01:21:06,209
You can't even see it, can you?

1046
01:21:06,383 --> 01:21:07,732
I can help you.

1047
01:21:07,906 --> 01:21:09,386
We're wasting time.

1048
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:12,780
Will you let me help you?

1049
01:21:12,955 --> 01:21:14,695
We need to get you
to the airport, and I--

1050
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:16,262
Where's the fly?

1051
01:21:21,006 --> 01:21:24,009
Shouldn't there be a fly?

1052
01:21:24,183 --> 01:21:26,446
Oh, I need you to be quiet now,
Ms. Hollis, please.

1053
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:30,407
Do you understand? Or is that you?

1054
01:21:30,581 --> 01:21:32,409
Be quiet--That's why you tell the story,

1055
01:21:32,583 --> 01:21:34,715
isn't it?I'm-- I'm not--

1056
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:38,719
You're the fly,
and you fucking know it.

1057
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:40,243
Please be quiet.

1058
01:21:40,417 --> 01:21:44,073
You're a fraud, a fake.
Buzzing about.

1059
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:51,950
Be quiet, please.

1060
01:21:54,213 --> 01:21:56,563
It's not real, James.

1061
01:21:58,957 --> 01:22:00,785
You're not real.

1062
01:25:41,919 --> 01:25:45,183
Legendary artist Jerome Debney
has died at the age of 84.

1063
01:25:45,357 --> 01:25:47,185
Debney reportedly suffered
a heart attack

1064
01:25:47,359 --> 01:25:50,275
at the estate of art dealer
Joseph Cassidy on Lake Como.

1065
01:25:50,449 --> 01:25:53,670
The empty frame
represented freedom.

1066
01:25:53,844 --> 01:25:56,890
It represented a new way to see.

1067
01:25:57,064 --> 01:25:58,849
It opened up a way to see.

1068
01:26:06,117 --> 01:26:07,988
Reclusive painter Jerome Debney has died today

1069
01:26:08,163 --> 01:26:10,643
of a heart attack. The artist had just turned 84.

1070
01:26:10,817 --> 01:26:14,212
It's like that,
the disappearance of the act.

1071
01:26:14,386 --> 01:26:19,130
The essence of Debney's, I would
say, greatness as an artist.

1072
01:26:19,304 --> 01:26:20,523
Debney's long career
was blighted

1073
01:26:20,697 --> 01:26:22,002
by a series of accidental fires,

1074
01:26:22,177 --> 01:26:23,482
destroying a gallery
in Paris,

1075
01:26:23,656 --> 01:26:25,571
his villa
in the south of France,

1076
01:26:25,745 --> 01:26:28,183
and most recently, his studio
on the Cassidy estate.

1077
01:26:28,357 --> 01:26:29,619
Art critic James Figueras,

1078
01:26:29,793 --> 01:26:31,795
who recently visited
Debney's studio

1079
01:26:31,969 --> 01:26:34,406
and is the only critic to have
examined Debney's late work,

1080
01:26:34,580 --> 01:26:36,321
says that:
"Both as a man and an artist,

1081
01:26:36,495 --> 01:26:38,410
Debney possessed
the sincerity, depth

1082
01:26:38,584 --> 01:26:40,543
and unflinching directness
of a prophet.

1083
01:26:40,717 --> 01:26:42,893
He was a voice calling out
in the desert."

1084
01:27:09,615 --> 01:27:10,660
Thank you.

1085
01:27:10,834 --> 01:27:13,750
Thank you so much. Bye.Thanks.

1086
01:27:13,924 --> 01:27:16,318
Well done, James. Good work.

1087
01:27:16,492 --> 01:27:18,929
Excuse me? Your essay, the real thing.

1088
01:27:19,103 --> 01:27:21,671
I mean, so rare nowadays.

1089
01:27:21,845 --> 01:27:24,935
Um, I sent an invitation
to your friend.

1090
01:27:25,109 --> 01:27:27,894
My friend?Yes, you know, Berenice.

1091
01:27:28,068 --> 01:27:29,766
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Her. Mm-hm.

1092
01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:31,985
I had to get
a professional acquaintance

1093
01:27:32,159 --> 01:27:33,857
to do a bit of, uh, research

1094
01:27:34,031 --> 01:27:36,163
because, uh, she seems
to have disappeared.

1095
01:27:38,122 --> 01:27:41,168
Difficult thing to do,
really, disappear.

1096
01:27:41,343 --> 01:27:44,607
Usually, you need a bit of help. What do you mean?

1097
01:27:44,781 --> 01:27:47,044
Well, you know,
with anything complicated,

1098
01:27:47,218 --> 01:27:49,046
you need a bit of assistance.

1099
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:52,615
Bloke I know tried it years ago.
Got into a bit of a scrape.

1100
01:27:52,789 --> 01:27:55,574
Not quite as easy as you think. No.

1101
01:27:55,748 --> 01:27:57,750
Lost touch with her, have you? Uh, yes.

1102
01:27:57,924 --> 01:28:00,187
You might say that, yeah. Yeah. Young love.

1103
01:28:00,362 --> 01:28:02,973
Heh-heh, so volatile.

1104
01:28:03,147 --> 01:28:06,498
Yeah. Suppose you had
to sacrifice her to your work.

1105
01:28:08,979 --> 01:28:11,024
Art can be such
a harsh mistress, can't she?

1106
01:28:11,198 --> 01:28:13,592
Oh, she can.Mm.

1107
01:28:13,766 --> 01:28:15,420
Let's mingle a bit, shall we? Mm-hm.

1108
01:28:15,594 --> 01:28:16,465
Come.

1109
01:28:18,293 --> 01:28:21,078
Duluth seemed a bit unlikely,
didn't it really?

1110
01:28:21,252 --> 01:28:22,906
In which way? Well, you know,

1111
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:26,562
that's where she was from,
really. Just like she said.

1112
01:28:26,736 --> 01:28:29,216
Tiny town south of the city.Mm-hm.

1113
01:28:29,391 --> 01:28:31,349
Lived with her mother
and an aunt.

1114
01:28:31,523 --> 01:28:32,959
Taught school,
if you can imagine that.

1115
01:28:34,787 --> 01:28:37,312
Do you want a drink? Uh, no, thanks.

1116
01:28:37,486 --> 01:28:38,530
Uh, no, thanks very much.

1117
01:28:40,750 --> 01:28:43,100
I think he might have
sent her a drawing.

1118
01:28:43,274 --> 01:28:44,884
Who?Debney.

1119
01:28:45,058 --> 01:28:47,539
What do you mean? Her mother said she received

1120
01:28:47,713 --> 01:28:51,804
a drawing of Berenice,
postmarked Italy.

1121
01:28:51,978 --> 01:28:54,633
Oh. I was a bit upset about that,

1122
01:28:54,807 --> 01:28:56,113
as you can imagine.Yeah.

1123
01:28:56,287 --> 01:28:57,810
Till I found out
it wasn't signed

1124
01:28:57,984 --> 01:29:00,422
and so it's bloody worthless.
Heh.

1125
01:29:00,596 --> 01:29:02,293
Such a shame. Oh, yes. What a shame.

1126
01:29:02,467 --> 01:29:04,251
Such a shame.Mm-hm.

1127
01:29:04,426 --> 01:29:05,905
I wouldn't worry too much.

1128
01:29:06,079 --> 01:29:07,907
She'll float back
into view one of these days.

1129
01:29:08,081 --> 01:29:10,257
I mean, they always do. Yeah.

1130
01:29:10,432 --> 01:29:11,389
Here we are.

1131
01:29:11,563 --> 01:29:13,826
The jewel in the crown.

1132
01:29:15,785 --> 01:29:18,570
You can't smoke
in here, James, sorry.

1133
01:29:18,744 --> 01:29:20,920
Oh, ah! I almost forgot.

1134
01:29:21,094 --> 01:29:23,923
This was found in Debney's desk
after he drowned.

1135
01:29:26,404 --> 01:29:28,319
I thought he died
of a heart attack.

1136
01:29:28,493 --> 01:29:30,713
Take a pick, one of the two. I
mean, he was in the pool anyway.

1137
01:29:30,887 --> 01:29:33,759
Was he swimming? Well, he fell in somehow.

1138
01:29:33,933 --> 01:29:36,066
I mean, Rodolfo found him.
He was all, uh, bloated

1139
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:38,547
and, uh, blue in the face.
A bit upsetting, really.

1140
01:29:40,331 --> 01:29:41,288
Hang on a minute.

1141
01:29:41,463 --> 01:29:42,420
Just gonna take this

1142
01:29:42,594 --> 01:29:44,335
from The Guardian.Hello?

1143
01:29:46,076 --> 01:29:49,949
James Figueras.
Evelina Macri from ARTnews.

1144
01:29:50,123 --> 01:29:51,168
Hello.

1145
01:29:51,342 --> 01:29:53,213
First of all, brilliant job.

1146
01:29:53,388 --> 01:29:56,042
Your restraint is what I found
most extraordinary.

1147
01:29:56,216 --> 01:29:58,349
It's as if you wrote an essay
on the solar system

1148
01:29:58,523 --> 01:30:01,134
and refused to mention the sun. Ha, ha, ha.

1149
01:30:01,308 --> 01:30:04,877
A lesser critic would've hung
his whole thesis on it.

1150
01:30:05,051 --> 01:30:07,924
But you chose to leave it
for us to discover.

1151
01:30:08,098 --> 01:30:09,621
To be shocked by, even.

1152
01:30:09,795 --> 01:30:13,451
Thank you. The ultimate mark of Debney.

1153
01:30:13,625 --> 01:30:17,107
Hidden right in the center of
things, as the truth always is.

1154
01:30:17,281 --> 01:30:19,588
Almost as if he imprinted
the mark of Cain

1155
01:30:19,762 --> 01:30:22,286
on his own forehead,
don't you think?

1156
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:24,419
Or is that too big a reach?

1157
01:30:25,855 --> 01:30:27,944
Excuse me?

1158
01:30:28,118 --> 01:30:29,685
The fingerprint.

1159
01:30:50,662 --> 01:30:52,577
James.

1160
01:30:52,751 --> 01:30:55,101
James. James, come meet
Philip Ricciardi.

1161
01:30:55,275 --> 01:30:57,539
From the Tate Modern.
You'll really like him.

1162
01:30:57,713 --> 01:30:59,497
You know, don't you? Know what?

1163
01:30:59,671 --> 01:31:01,804
Just say it.Say what?

1164
01:31:01,978 --> 01:31:03,501
The truth.

1165
01:31:03,675 --> 01:31:05,285
The truth, James? Yes.

1166
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:08,898
The truth. Come on.

1167
01:31:09,072 --> 01:31:11,378
Philip. Oh, hello. Joseph.

1168
01:31:11,553 --> 01:31:13,337
You know James? James. Of course.

1169
01:31:14,425 --> 01:31:16,558
Evelina.

1170
01:31:36,708 --> 01:31:38,231
Mr. Figueras.

1171
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:41,408
Thank you.

1172
01:31:55,945 --> 01:31:57,512
 Over the weekend, at worst,

1173
01:31:57,686 --> 01:31:59,644
we're gonna have
a round of flurries,

1174
01:31:59,818 --> 01:32:01,907
particularly
in Central Minnesota,

1175
01:32:02,081 --> 01:32:04,867
with the real snow starting
either late Sunday night

1176
01:32:05,041 --> 01:32:07,130
or in the predawn hours
of Monday.

1177
01:32:07,304 --> 01:32:09,306
It'll be a heavy,
wet-consistency snow,

1178
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:12,048
accompanied by wind, coming
out during the day Monday,

1179
01:32:12,222 --> 01:32:14,790
gusts at 30 or 35 miles
an hour.

1180
01:32:14,964 --> 01:32:17,314
And this type
of storm track favors

1181
01:32:17,488 --> 01:32:20,665
a narrow swath
of 8 to 12 inches of snow...
