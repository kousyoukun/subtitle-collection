1
00:01:57,092 --> 00:01:58,802
Fuck.

2
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,696
Let me be blunt.

3
00:02:17,779 --> 00:02:22,451
Art would not exist without criticism.

4
00:02:23,452 --> 00:02:27,914
It would not exist.

5
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:33,253
I like to think of myself
and my fellow critics, collectively,

6
00:02:33,337 --> 00:02:38,050
as the banks on a river,
and art is the water that flows between us.

7
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:41,720
And we work to channel this flow,

8
00:02:41,803 --> 00:02:44,723
guide it, to restrain it,
you might even say.

9
00:02:45,724 --> 00:02:51,229
Because without banks, even the greatest
of torrents would be, what?

10
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:56,735
Floodplain, listless expanse
of mud and flies.

11
00:02:56,818 --> 00:02:59,613
<i>Now, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

12
00:02:59,696 --> 00:03:02,783
please examine this painting, if you will.

13
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:05,369
What do you feel?

14
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,956
Indifference, am I correct?

15
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:11,333
You are unmoved.

16
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:15,170
Let's be honest, this is no more interesting
than your average wallpaper, is it?

17
00:03:15,253 --> 00:03:18,924
Look at the brushstrokes, so...
So rough and clumsy.

18
00:03:19,007 --> 00:03:21,468
Almost like a child's painting, no?

19
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:27,182
Is anyone here familiar
with the work of Nils Ingen?

20
00:03:27,265 --> 00:03:30,227
Well, don't be ashamed.
He's not very well-known in America.

21
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,896
Don't be ashamed.
He's not very well-known in America.

22
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,357
Let me tell you a little bit about Nils.

23
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,445
Nils was 16 and already something
of a prodigy when the Nazis invaded Norway.

24
00:03:40,529 --> 00:03:45,325
Nils and his twin sister joined
the Resistance a year into the occupation.

25
00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:47,494
They were betrayed.

26
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:53,750
Betrayed, arrested and transported
to the concentration camp in Buchenwald.

27
00:03:55,210 --> 00:04:00,048
Nils kept himself and his sister alive
by painting portraits of the camp officers.

28
00:04:00,132 --> 00:04:04,261
And this is something
for which he felt great shame after the war.

29
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,805
So Nils vowed two things:

30
00:04:07,973 --> 00:04:10,434
Never to paint another human figure

31
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:13,312
and never to touch a brush again.

32
00:04:13,395 --> 00:04:14,563
And, therefore...

33
00:04:15,772 --> 00:04:18,107
...the rough working of the paint.

34
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,652
All of Nils's postwar canvases
were undertaken

35
00:04:20,736 --> 00:04:24,698
either with a palette knife
or with his fingers.

36
00:04:24,781 --> 00:04:28,660
Nils titled this particular painting, <i>Nora,</i>
after his sister.

37
00:04:30,954 --> 00:04:34,666
She died, in 1955, of consumption,

38
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,336
which she contracted at Buchenwald.

39
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:39,796
And that gray...

40
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:42,591
And that... And that gray...

41
00:04:42,674 --> 00:04:46,011
That gray, vaguely avian shape...

42
00:04:48,138 --> 00:04:52,309
some see that as a representation
of Nora's soul,

43
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:58,065
slipping its earthly bonds, free at last,
after enduring so much horror here.

44
00:04:59,107 --> 00:05:01,610
This painting was Nils's last painting.

45
00:05:01,693 --> 00:05:04,279
With Nora dead, he refused to eat anything,

46
00:05:04,363 --> 00:05:08,909
and nothing but water passed his lips
for the next 27 days.

47
00:05:08,992 --> 00:05:12,537
He continued to work on the canvas
as he weakened,

48
00:05:12,621 --> 00:05:16,249
and reportedly that bird-like shape

49
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,794
was the last detail that he added.

50
00:05:18,877 --> 00:05:23,256
So I suppose you could see this painting...

51
00:05:24,466 --> 00:05:26,009
as a suicide note.

52
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:30,472
A cri de coeur, famous last words,
cry from the heart.

53
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:37,938
Looks like a different painting now,
doesn't it?

54
00:05:38,021 --> 00:05:41,275
It looks like a different painting now.

55
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:44,778
- Doesn't it?
- Absolutely.

56
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:47,489
There's a poignancy to it
that you hadn't noticed before,

57
00:05:47,572 --> 00:05:50,534
and there's far more technical skill
than you first assumed.

58
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:54,496
And all of this simply because of what I,
as a critic

59
00:05:54,579 --> 00:05:56,248
and an expert, have shared with you.

60
00:05:56,331 --> 00:06:01,586
I suppose you could say that I have shaped
your experience of this painting.

61
00:06:02,713 --> 00:06:05,465
Would anyone like a print?

62
00:06:08,719 --> 00:06:10,304
Let me...

63
00:06:10,387 --> 00:06:13,181
Let me share one last detail with you.

64
00:06:13,265 --> 00:06:16,560
Everything I just told you
about Nils and Nora...

65
00:06:17,561 --> 00:06:19,396
Lies. Lies.

66
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,024
Lies. Just a pack of lies.

67
00:06:22,107 --> 00:06:23,859
I painted this painting.

68
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,238
And it's trash. And you can see that, right?

69
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:29,698
It took me 30 minutes.

70
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:33,869
And it's just paint slapped down
without any real care or inspiration.

71
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,623
So is anyone still interested in a print?

72
00:06:40,417 --> 00:06:42,628
No, I thought not.

73
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:48,050
I single-handedly made you believe
that this was a masterpiece.

74
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:51,595
You believed, you have to admit it.

75
00:06:52,804 --> 00:06:55,474
That, my dear friends,
is the power of the critic,

76
00:06:55,557 --> 00:06:59,227
and that's why you should be careful
with someone like me.

77
00:07:03,941 --> 00:07:06,151
Thank you. Thank you.

78
00:07:32,135 --> 00:07:34,680
You're not really how I imagined
an art critic would look.

79
00:07:34,763 --> 00:07:39,059
Well, you know what they say
about the book and its cover, Ms...?

80
00:07:39,142 --> 00:07:41,603
Hollis. Berenice Hollis.

81
00:07:42,604 --> 00:07:44,773
Are you interested in art, Ms. Hollis?

82
00:07:44,856 --> 00:07:47,401
I just came here for the potato chips.

83
00:07:47,484 --> 00:07:49,278
No offense, Mr. Figueras.

84
00:07:49,361 --> 00:07:52,656
I just reached a point in my life
where I appreciate the value of free things.

85
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:53,865
Oh, I see.

86
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:56,785
So that painting...

87
00:07:57,786 --> 00:07:59,162
I'd like a print.

88
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,253
There aren't any.

89
00:08:06,336 --> 00:08:10,507
That was just what you call
an oratorical gesture.

90
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,509
Oh, you're one of those.

91
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,971
- One of which?
- A liar.

92
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,684
That's harsh, don't you think?

93
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:22,603
If the shoe fits.

94
00:08:24,646 --> 00:08:26,023
Yeah.

95
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,131
Sorry.

96
00:08:51,214 --> 00:08:52,633
Sorry.

97
00:09:06,188 --> 00:09:07,648
Water?

98
00:09:10,901 --> 00:09:14,237
Ever wonder when something
is just starting, how it's gonna end?

99
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:15,197
Like what?

100
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,408
Anything. Us, say.

101
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:25,791
A week from now,
I'll be planning our wedding.

102
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:30,754
Then I'll take you to an opening,
and as I look across the room,

103
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:32,464
I'll see you talking to this artist,

104
00:09:32,547 --> 00:09:36,927
this broad-shouldered artist, sculptor.

105
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,137
Big hands.

106
00:09:39,221 --> 00:09:42,599
And as you leave with him,
you give me a little wave.

107
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:48,855
And I'll climb to the top of the duomo,
throw myself off in grief.

108
00:09:48,939 --> 00:09:50,774
You're gonna make me your whore.

109
00:09:51,775 --> 00:09:54,653
I'll be turning tricks to support you
while you visit your galleries

110
00:09:54,736 --> 00:09:58,657
and you write your articles and you sip
champagne with your high-class friends.

111
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,367
- For love.
- That's right.

112
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,704
I'll catch some disease,
lose my teeth, go blind...

113
00:10:03,787 --> 00:10:05,789
- No.
- ...be dead in a year.

114
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:07,416
All for love.

115
00:10:07,499 --> 00:10:09,334
We'll have babies.

116
00:10:10,335 --> 00:10:13,422
Girl named Amy, boy named Matt.

117
00:10:13,505 --> 00:10:16,341
We'll move to the States,
Connecticut probably.

118
00:10:16,425 --> 00:10:19,511
Buy a house, porch with a swing
and a brook.

119
00:10:19,594 --> 00:10:20,762
Babbling.

120
00:10:20,846 --> 00:10:22,931
Of course. And a stone wall.

121
00:10:23,015 --> 00:10:24,182
And I'll die first.

122
00:10:24,266 --> 00:10:27,936
Some sort of lingering cancer
that you'll nurse me through.

123
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,062
And then you.

124
00:10:29,146 --> 00:10:33,692
And our kids will insist
that you died of a broken heart.

125
00:10:34,693 --> 00:10:36,194
I'm gonna get up now.

126
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:37,696
Shower, leave.

127
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:40,407
We'll never see each other again.

128
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,993
All you gotta do is lie here
and let it happen.

129
00:10:44,328 --> 00:10:45,954
Got it?

130
00:10:46,038 --> 00:10:47,581
Got it.

131
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:15,359
Come in.

132
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,236
Want an upper?

133
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,196
Sure.

134
00:11:25,994 --> 00:11:27,955
What are you doing this weekend?

135
00:11:28,038 --> 00:11:29,498
What?

136
00:11:30,499 --> 00:11:33,919
You're supposed to ask me out
before you fuck me.

137
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,798
- Ever heard of Joseph Cassidy?
- The art dealer?

138
00:11:37,881 --> 00:11:40,550
- Yeah.
- Been invited to his estate.

139
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:41,843
You got rich friends.

140
00:11:41,927 --> 00:11:44,763
- Well, I've never met him.
- Then why the invite?

141
00:11:44,846 --> 00:11:47,516
I'm guessing he wants me to write
a catalog for his collection,

142
00:11:47,599 --> 00:11:49,851
and it would be a nice gig
if I could land it.

143
00:11:49,935 --> 00:11:54,606
And I bet there'll be
some free cucumber sandwiches.

144
00:11:55,691 --> 00:11:57,150
So, what do you say?

145
00:11:57,234 --> 00:12:01,196
- You'll be my chauffeur?
- Share the driving?

146
00:12:49,494 --> 00:12:51,622
<i>James, hi.</i>

147
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:53,832
<i>It's Louisa, Louisa Prentes.</i>

148
00:12:53,915 --> 00:12:56,335
<i>It's rather awkward for me
to be calling you about this,</i>

149
00:12:56,418 --> 00:12:59,963
<i>but the check you gave me
was returned by my bank.</i>

150
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:01,715
<i>If you'd give me a call back, thanks.</i>

151
00:13:09,973 --> 00:13:11,642
Who died, little girl?

152
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:13,644
Your poor Norwegian.

153
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:15,520
I keep thinking he was real.

154
00:13:15,604 --> 00:13:16,980
He was real.

155
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:20,484
- You said you made him up.
- No, just the end.

156
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:23,028
Nils and Nora were real,

157
00:13:23,111 --> 00:13:27,407
and Nils survived for a time at Buchenwald
by painting the German officers.

158
00:13:27,491 --> 00:13:30,243
- For a time.
- For a time.

159
00:13:30,327 --> 00:13:33,455
In medieval painting,
the fly represented sin,

160
00:13:33,538 --> 00:13:37,459
so if an artist added a fly to a portrait,
for instance,

161
00:13:37,542 --> 00:13:40,379
it meant that that person was damned.

162
00:13:40,462 --> 00:13:42,756
I suppose you can see where this is headed.

163
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:44,633
Nils painted flies on the Germans.

164
00:13:44,716 --> 00:13:45,717
He did.

165
00:13:45,801 --> 00:13:51,390
Unfortunately, his camp commandant
was something of an amateur art historian,

166
00:13:51,473 --> 00:13:55,686
and he took exception,
and Nils was gutted like a deer,

167
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:57,729
- left out in the yard for the flies...
- Stop.

168
00:13:57,813 --> 00:14:00,023
...to feast on.

169
00:14:01,358 --> 00:14:03,110
You asked.

170
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:06,738
What about Nora?

171
00:14:06,822 --> 00:14:11,994
Nora spent her postwar years in Paris,
drinking too much and painting some.

172
00:14:12,077 --> 00:14:13,745
Badly, I'm afraid.

173
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:16,164
She just wasted away, basically.

174
00:14:16,248 --> 00:14:19,126
That was Nora's painting you showed us,
wasn't it?

175
00:14:20,127 --> 00:14:22,713
Why didn't you say so?

176
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:25,924
Because my story's much more poignant,
Nils starving and everything.

177
00:14:26,008 --> 00:14:27,926
Yeah, but it's not true.

178
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,886
- Does that matter?
- Of course it matters.

179
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:33,140
That's what art's about, isn't it?
The truth.

180
00:14:33,223 --> 00:14:34,516
No.

181
00:14:35,601 --> 00:14:40,439
I mean, pumpkin, if it's just about telling
the truth, anybody could do it.

182
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,817
My job is to separate the good lies
from the bad ones.

183
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,069
And how do you do that?

184
00:14:47,404 --> 00:14:50,782
Well, is your name really Berenice?

185
00:14:54,286 --> 00:14:56,580
Why would I make that up?

186
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:58,498
That's not a yes.

187
00:14:58,582 --> 00:15:00,917
It's not a no either.

188
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:06,798
Okay.

189
00:16:01,103 --> 00:16:03,105
Let's get the bags.

190
00:16:38,223 --> 00:16:40,475
Lunch is in an hour. Please be prompt.

191
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:42,060
Thank you.

192
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,168
I was a kid...

193
00:17:07,169 --> 00:17:10,589
exactly the kind of place
I dreamed of living.

194
00:17:10,671 --> 00:17:12,174
Princess in a castle.

195
00:17:12,256 --> 00:17:13,925
How about you?

196
00:17:14,009 --> 00:17:16,469
What'd you wanna be when you were a kid?

197
00:17:16,553 --> 00:17:18,513
Oh, I was never a kid.

198
00:17:18,597 --> 00:17:21,099
I hatched from the egg like this,
fully grown.

199
00:17:21,183 --> 00:17:22,434
Come on.

200
00:17:23,435 --> 00:17:26,021
Seriously, you can't tell me
you never wanted to paint.

201
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:30,400
Have you ever been to New York?

202
00:17:31,401 --> 00:17:32,694
Yeah.

203
00:17:32,778 --> 00:17:37,783
You know those big banners they hang
outside the museums for special exhibitions?

204
00:17:39,076 --> 00:17:41,078
I wanted one.

205
00:17:44,206 --> 00:17:46,041
"Figueras."

206
00:17:47,042 --> 00:17:49,252
I had a teacher in art school.

207
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:50,796
Good teacher.

208
00:17:51,922 --> 00:17:54,758
She took me aside one day
and told me that I was much better

209
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:57,427
at talking about art than doing it,

210
00:17:57,511 --> 00:18:00,764
and said it only had to be a tragedy
if I made it one.

211
00:18:01,765 --> 00:18:04,268
You still want that banner though,
don't you?

212
00:18:29,501 --> 00:18:31,878
Follow your heart.

213
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:47,436
Do you realize how many museums
that would consider this their centerpiece?

214
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:51,106
And here, it's just another slap of paint
on the wall.

215
00:18:51,189 --> 00:18:52,524
He live alone?

216
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:56,570
- Has that feel, doesn't it?
- Must be lonely.

217
00:18:57,571 --> 00:19:01,158
- What?
- Man like Cassidy? It's a choice.

218
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:06,038
Women can't understand that as a rule,
the allure of solitude.

219
00:19:06,121 --> 00:19:09,166
- And you do?
- Oh, yeah. This is how I live too.

220
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:10,500
On a...

221
00:19:11,501 --> 00:19:14,379
slightly more modest scale, but still.

222
00:19:14,463 --> 00:19:16,089
Just a lone wolf, huh?

223
00:19:16,173 --> 00:19:19,092
Scoff all you want.
I've been a monk here in Italy.

224
00:19:19,176 --> 00:19:22,429
Art my only mistress.

225
00:19:30,395 --> 00:19:33,148
I bet you, he overpaid for these.

226
00:19:33,231 --> 00:19:36,652
And 10 years from now,
he won't be able to give them away.

227
00:19:36,735 --> 00:19:39,363
Would it help you, Mr. Figueras,
if I told you

228
00:19:39,446 --> 00:19:42,449
that I had a terrible stammer
when I was a child?

229
00:19:42,532 --> 00:19:46,370
- Took me years to get over it.
- I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

230
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:49,247
A neighbor of mine gave me some advice.

231
00:19:49,331 --> 00:19:53,293
Try and sing through the words
to help ease their passage.

232
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:59,800
This makes my attachment to these pictures
seem a bit sentimental, I know,

233
00:19:59,883 --> 00:20:02,219
but I like the reminder that they bring,

234
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:06,932
that I should never let
a thing's worth obscure its value.

235
00:20:07,015 --> 00:20:08,475
Ms. Hollis.

236
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:10,060
Am I correct?

237
00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:11,728
Joseph Cassidy.

238
00:20:11,812 --> 00:20:15,524
- Welcome to my summer cottage.
- Thank you for having us.

239
00:20:15,607 --> 00:20:17,025
<i>Aperitivo,</i> anyone?

240
00:20:19,569 --> 00:20:21,863
I really must apologize.

241
00:20:21,947 --> 00:20:26,285
I couldn't help but overhear
your conversation as I entered.

242
00:20:26,368 --> 00:20:28,078
It was fascinating.

243
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:30,622
People and their hunches.

244
00:20:30,706 --> 00:20:33,125
How some have the gift and others don't.

245
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:36,420
Always trust your hunches, my dear.
You have the gift.

246
00:20:37,421 --> 00:20:40,299
You were quite right to suspect
that Mr. Figueras here

247
00:20:40,382 --> 00:20:45,595
has been leading a decidedly un-monastic
existence during his Italian sojourn.

248
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,931
There was a Ms. Sofia Rosselli,

249
00:20:48,015 --> 00:20:53,812
and then there was a Mrs. Louisa Prentes,
and then... Oh, come on.

250
00:20:53,895 --> 00:20:56,315
Don't look so uncomfortable, Mr. Figueras.

251
00:20:56,398 --> 00:21:00,027
I invited you over to my house,
I'm bound to make inquiries.

252
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:03,864
By the way, my home life,
you completely misread it.

253
00:21:03,947 --> 00:21:05,115
This is my wife's estate.

254
00:21:05,198 --> 00:21:08,327
It's been in her family for generations.
If you'd have come here yesterday,

255
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,704
you would've found
the place swarming with people.

256
00:21:10,787 --> 00:21:14,207
I mean, children, grandchildren,
dogs, cats, nannies.

257
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:17,586
They all decamped for London this morning,
the whole bloody shooting match.

258
00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:22,341
Can still sort of smell them a bit though,
can't you?

259
00:21:22,424 --> 00:21:24,926
That sort of funny child smell.

260
00:21:26,303 --> 00:21:29,389
- Jim. Can I call you Jim?
- Please.

261
00:21:30,515 --> 00:21:35,604
Just winding you up. Why would you think
my children would have a peculiar smell?

262
00:21:38,231 --> 00:21:42,152
Berenice, you've been a bit quiet.

263
00:21:42,235 --> 00:21:44,988
- I hope we haven't bored you too much.
- Oh, not at all.

264
00:21:45,072 --> 00:21:48,075
Maybe I should've made more of an effort
to draw you out, but I...

265
00:21:48,158 --> 00:21:51,536
I sense you're someone not overly fond
of personal questions.

266
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,539
- And why would that be?
- I don't know.

267
00:21:54,623 --> 00:21:57,793
Just a hunch. Maybe I'm wrong.

268
00:21:57,876 --> 00:22:00,462
- Where are you from?
- Duluth.

269
00:22:00,545 --> 00:22:02,464
Minnesota?

270
00:22:02,547 --> 00:22:03,674
The Art Institute there,

271
00:22:03,757 --> 00:22:07,594
they used to have a really lovely
Toulouse-Lautrec, but no more.

272
00:22:07,678 --> 00:22:11,098
When I say Duluth,
I mean a small town south of the city.

273
00:22:11,181 --> 00:22:12,391
Which one?

274
00:22:13,392 --> 00:22:16,395
It's quite small, Mr. Cassidy.
I'm sure you've never heard of it.

275
00:22:16,478 --> 00:22:17,938
Oh, of course not.

276
00:22:18,021 --> 00:22:20,857
Nice to be from a small town though,
isn't it?

277
00:22:20,941 --> 00:22:21,984
How so?

278
00:22:22,067 --> 00:22:25,404
Well, you venture into the world
like a newborn,

279
00:22:25,487 --> 00:22:27,656
free to be whomever you choose.

280
00:22:28,991 --> 00:22:33,287
You know, neither of you have mentioned
the empty chair.

281
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:35,247
I assumed that was for your wife.

282
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:38,583
What if I told you that,
at the edge of my property,

283
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:40,752
there's a dilapidated little house,

284
00:22:40,836 --> 00:22:45,299
and in this house there's a man
who I invite for lunch every day,

285
00:22:45,382 --> 00:22:50,679
and the only response I ever get from him
is this empty chair?

286
00:22:50,762 --> 00:22:52,306
Who is it?

287
00:22:52,389 --> 00:22:57,227
This man, my dear young friend,
is the reason that I summoned you here.

288
00:22:58,812 --> 00:23:00,856
I don't understand.

289
00:23:00,939 --> 00:23:04,484
Rodolfo, let's have coffee
on the terrace, shall we?

290
00:23:04,568 --> 00:23:05,861
Very well, sir.

291
00:23:12,326 --> 00:23:17,372
If you could interview any living artist,
who do you think it would be?

292
00:23:17,456 --> 00:23:20,125
- Anselm Kiefer.
- Kiefer?

293
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:23,503
Kiefer will speak to anyone
with an open notebook, I think.

294
00:23:23,587 --> 00:23:27,341
No, put yourself
in a bit more rarefied company, okay?

295
00:23:28,425 --> 00:23:33,388
No critic has spoken to this guy
in over 50 years.

296
00:23:33,472 --> 00:23:37,225
It's been that long
since anyone's even seen this man's work.

297
00:23:37,309 --> 00:23:38,518
Still not with you.

298
00:23:38,602 --> 00:23:39,645
Okay.

299
00:23:39,728 --> 00:23:41,271
If I say to you:

300
00:23:41,355 --> 00:23:43,231
Paris, 1968.

301
00:23:43,315 --> 00:23:47,361
Twelve paintings gone up in flames
in a gallery fire.

302
00:23:47,444 --> 00:23:50,072
You're fucking with me.

303
00:23:50,155 --> 00:23:53,283
Two days later,
on the same smoke-stained walls,

304
00:23:53,367 --> 00:23:56,036
an empty picture frame appears.

305
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:58,872
A little notecard by it, which read:

306
00:23:58,956 --> 00:24:00,999
"Jerome Debney. Number One."

307
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:03,961
Oh, yeah, my college roommate had
a poster of that on her wall.

308
00:24:04,044 --> 00:24:06,046
You're really saying Jerome Debney is here?

309
00:24:06,129 --> 00:24:08,131
What was the last you heard of him?

310
00:24:08,215 --> 00:24:11,885
Another fire, about a year ago,
in his studio and house in France.

311
00:24:11,969 --> 00:24:14,888
Everything burned down. He lost everything.

312
00:24:14,972 --> 00:24:17,891
A lifetime's work went up in flames,
and no one ever got to see it.

313
00:24:17,975 --> 00:24:21,270
Gone. As if it never existed.

314
00:24:21,353 --> 00:24:24,481
He is not a wealthy man,
gets all his money from a charitable trust.

315
00:24:24,564 --> 00:24:25,816
- The Debney Trust.
- Yeah.

316
00:24:25,899 --> 00:24:28,610
Upon whose board I'm very honored to sit.

317
00:24:28,694 --> 00:24:33,115
And in that capacity,
I'm to offer the great man accommodations.

318
00:24:33,198 --> 00:24:34,741
So now every morning,

319
00:24:34,825 --> 00:24:40,038
I got Jerome bloody Debney
sunning himself beside my pool.

320
00:24:41,623 --> 00:24:43,875
- Rodolfo?
- Sir?

321
00:24:43,959 --> 00:24:47,713
What was Mr. Debney reading
when you picked him up the other day?

322
00:24:47,796 --> 00:24:50,257
<i>Flash Art,</i> sir. The March issue.

323
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,926
- Mr. Figueras' column.
- Oh, you're kidding me.

324
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:54,970
And what was he doing
while he was reading it?

325
00:24:55,053 --> 00:24:56,054
Chuckling, sir.

326
00:24:56,138 --> 00:24:59,683
He said, "This young man is quite amusing."

327
00:24:59,766 --> 00:25:04,896
Berenice, would you mind if I borrow James
for a little private conversation?

328
00:25:06,023 --> 00:25:07,190
No.

329
00:25:11,153 --> 00:25:16,742
I employ a team of investigators
to ensure authenticity and chain of title.

330
00:25:16,825 --> 00:25:18,201
I see.

331
00:25:18,285 --> 00:25:22,789
One of them came across a recent piece
by you on Modigliani's brushstrokes.

332
00:25:22,873 --> 00:25:25,250
- Do you remember that?
- Yes, of course.

333
00:25:25,334 --> 00:25:27,502
Rather interesting thesis.

334
00:25:27,586 --> 00:25:33,425
Helped me overcome some uncertainty
over a particular Modigliani provenance,

335
00:25:33,508 --> 00:25:35,469
<i>Woman with a Red Scarf.</i>

336
00:25:36,511 --> 00:25:38,972
We made a rather profitable sale
to the Tate.

337
00:25:39,056 --> 00:25:41,183
Oh, it's in the Tate now.

338
00:25:41,266 --> 00:25:44,061
Yeah, it kind of sparked
my curiosity though.

339
00:25:44,144 --> 00:25:46,396
So I had my people do a bit more digging.

340
00:25:47,397 --> 00:25:50,400
You were quite the boy wonder,
weren't you, James?

341
00:25:51,401 --> 00:25:53,487
Reading your old articles,

342
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:56,198
one would've thought
you'd be running a museum by now.

343
00:25:56,281 --> 00:25:58,825
- Yeah, well...
- What happened, James?

344
00:26:00,702 --> 00:26:01,870
Embezzlement, right?

345
00:26:02,913 --> 00:26:05,999
Well, that makes it sound
like something it wasn't.

346
00:26:07,042 --> 00:26:08,669
What was it then?

347
00:26:08,752 --> 00:26:12,297
The gallery had an account
for incidental expenses,

348
00:26:12,381 --> 00:26:14,967
and I thought it would be all right to...

349
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:17,719
borrow a small amount and then repay it.

350
00:26:17,803 --> 00:26:20,180
Sounds like something
pretty easy to sort out.

351
00:26:21,181 --> 00:26:23,475
I didn't handle that situation very well.

352
00:26:23,558 --> 00:26:26,353
I had more of a temper back then.

353
00:26:26,436 --> 00:26:27,854
Oh, did you?

354
00:26:28,855 --> 00:26:31,233
Matured with age, have you?

355
00:26:32,609 --> 00:26:34,820
What is this about, Mr. Cassidy?

356
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:37,281
Redemption.

357
00:26:38,282 --> 00:26:40,450
Think of the splash it would make.

358
00:26:41,451 --> 00:26:45,289
The first critic to interview Jerome Debney
in over 50 years,

359
00:26:45,372 --> 00:26:48,709
to see and describe his current work, and...

360
00:26:49,793 --> 00:26:53,797
You know, I could pull quite a few strings,

361
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,383
and you could be running
a major museum soon.

362
00:26:57,384 --> 00:27:00,470
And why would you do this for me?

363
00:27:01,972 --> 00:27:05,100
I'd value a Debney, James,

364
00:27:06,101 --> 00:27:09,771
and I'd like you to procure one for me.

365
00:27:09,855 --> 00:27:11,523
How am I supposed to do that?

366
00:27:11,607 --> 00:27:14,901
Well, that's a transaction
between you and Mr. Debney, isn't it?

367
00:27:14,985 --> 00:27:19,406
Yes, but what's to keep me from doing the
interview without getting you the painting?

368
00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:26,872
Did someone pay you
to write that Modigliani article?

369
00:27:27,873 --> 00:27:30,500
A man called Charles Clay?

370
00:27:31,543 --> 00:27:34,296
Charles Clay sold me
<i>Woman with the Red Scarf.</i>

371
00:27:37,966 --> 00:27:41,470
Did you know you were helping
to validate a forgery?

372
00:27:41,553 --> 00:27:43,472
Or were you duped as well?

373
00:27:43,555 --> 00:27:45,349
It's not a forgery.

374
00:27:47,476 --> 00:27:51,688
Anyway, be the end of your fucking career,
wouldn't it?

375
00:27:58,028 --> 00:27:59,613
You sold it to the Tate.

376
00:27:59,696 --> 00:28:04,785
Well, I know, but I rely on the expertise
of scholars in these matters.

377
00:28:06,161 --> 00:28:07,162
Anyway...

378
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:13,126
I'm off to London tomorrow morning, so you
and Berenice can have the run of the place.

379
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:15,671
See what you can manage.

380
00:28:47,327 --> 00:28:48,787
Want one?

381
00:28:51,248 --> 00:28:52,791
You got a habit, captain?

382
00:28:52,874 --> 00:28:54,543
Just a little boost now and then.

383
00:28:54,626 --> 00:28:57,296
- How many a day?
- Who's counting?

384
00:28:58,547 --> 00:29:01,800
Where I'm from, that's called a habit.

385
00:29:01,883 --> 00:29:03,844
Duluth, huh?

386
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,015
- Thought there was an accent.
- A Duluth accent?

387
00:29:08,098 --> 00:29:10,809
Minnesota. Something weird with the vowels.

388
00:29:11,852 --> 00:29:14,730
I thought all addicts were hapless losers.

389
00:29:14,813 --> 00:29:16,565
Whoa, are we fighting?

390
00:29:16,648 --> 00:29:19,234
- Only if you want to.
- Our first squabble. Okay, bring it on.

391
00:29:19,318 --> 00:29:21,528
- Call me a name.
- Asshole.

392
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:23,822
Put effort into it.

393
00:29:23,905 --> 00:29:25,782
Bastard.

394
00:29:25,866 --> 00:29:29,620
Son of a bitch, piece of shit,
motherfucker, cocksucker.

395
00:29:29,703 --> 00:29:33,665
Say something bad about my character
and make it sting.

396
00:29:33,749 --> 00:29:36,585
You treat serious things
as if they were trivial

397
00:29:36,668 --> 00:29:39,546
and trivial things as if they were serious.

398
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:40,797
Come on.

399
00:29:40,881 --> 00:29:44,760
You have one more go,
then I will show you how it's done.

400
00:29:46,011 --> 00:29:47,596
How many days you think I got left?

401
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,806
- Left?
- To live.

402
00:29:51,558 --> 00:29:55,520
- I mean, what kind of question is that?
- There's a number, right? For both of us.

403
00:29:55,604 --> 00:29:57,397
Days, hours, minutes.

404
00:29:57,481 --> 00:29:59,900
After this minute right here, one less.

405
00:29:59,983 --> 00:30:03,236
- That's how it works.
- So why waste it like this?

406
00:30:08,033 --> 00:30:10,452
We're friends, right?

407
00:30:10,535 --> 00:30:11,828
The best.

408
00:30:11,912 --> 00:30:14,581
So who gives a fuck where I'm from?

409
00:31:31,533 --> 00:31:33,827
I can mail that for you, ma'am.

410
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:36,663
- If you like.
- Yeah, that'd be great.

411
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:40,500
Thank you.

412
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:44,921
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.

413
00:31:45,005 --> 00:31:47,591
Have you got a pen pal, sugarplum?

414
00:31:47,674 --> 00:31:49,259
Just my mama.

415
00:31:49,343 --> 00:31:51,386
Back in old Duluth?

416
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:54,014
Had to tell her I met a boy.

417
00:31:57,351 --> 00:31:59,478
Not a word.

418
00:32:01,271 --> 00:32:02,648
Watch.

419
00:32:19,998 --> 00:32:22,417
- Good one.
- Very good one.

420
00:32:22,501 --> 00:32:24,711
Man of many skills.

421
00:32:24,795 --> 00:32:26,463
That's right.

422
00:32:27,714 --> 00:32:30,717
I had the weirdest dream last night.

423
00:32:30,801 --> 00:32:33,428
Weird is how they generally come
in my experience.

424
00:32:33,512 --> 00:32:35,013
I woke up real early.

425
00:32:36,014 --> 00:32:38,392
Heard someone whispering,
so I went to the door,

426
00:32:38,475 --> 00:32:40,310
cracked it open,

427
00:32:40,394 --> 00:32:42,187
and there you were,

428
00:32:42,271 --> 00:32:44,314
down the corridor in a robe with Cassidy,

429
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:48,944
and he gave you an envelope, a thick one.

430
00:32:50,821 --> 00:32:53,657
And here I was thinking flying horses,

431
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:56,034
sex with your mother, that kind of weird.

432
00:32:56,118 --> 00:32:57,953
I went back to bed and lay there wondering:

433
00:32:58,036 --> 00:33:02,708
"Why would Cassidy give her
an envelope full of cash?"

434
00:33:02,791 --> 00:33:05,460
"Her" being me.

435
00:33:10,674 --> 00:33:13,427
This is a dream we're talking about, right?

436
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,636
Is it?

437
00:33:15,637 --> 00:33:17,806
You're a funny one, aren't you?

438
00:33:31,945 --> 00:33:33,822
Oh, look.

439
00:33:36,325 --> 00:33:39,244
We'll tell our grandchildren about this.

440
00:33:41,371 --> 00:33:44,833
I came here a pauper,
but I'll leave a prince, a fucking emperor.

441
00:33:44,916 --> 00:33:47,210
I saw blue once.

442
00:33:49,671 --> 00:33:52,257
Genuine blue, you understand.

443
00:33:53,258 --> 00:33:55,469
Platonic blue.

444
00:33:56,637 --> 00:33:59,139
In a pool much like this.

445
00:34:00,557 --> 00:34:02,893
I was underwater,

446
00:34:02,976 --> 00:34:05,479
staring upwards at the sky.

447
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:12,361
And perhaps it was merely
a deficit of oxygen.

448
00:34:14,071 --> 00:34:16,073
But for a moment...

449
00:34:17,074 --> 00:34:18,575
blue.

450
00:34:20,701 --> 00:34:24,581
I've been searching for it ever since.

451
00:34:26,708 --> 00:34:28,210
Mr. Figueras,

452
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:30,754
I thought it might be you.

453
00:34:32,089 --> 00:34:34,383
You've shaved your beard.

454
00:34:34,466 --> 00:34:37,636
You must grow it back. It adds character.

455
00:34:39,513 --> 00:34:41,390
Honored, Mr. Debney.

456
00:34:41,473 --> 00:34:43,475
And startled. How did you...?

457
00:34:43,558 --> 00:34:47,604
Your column, every month,
with its little photo.

458
00:34:47,688 --> 00:34:52,359
Oh, it's a fine thing to see a young man
with such a clear eye.

459
00:34:52,442 --> 00:34:55,654
And your beautiful friend,
you hope to protect her from my charm.

460
00:34:55,737 --> 00:34:58,865
- She has a name, I assume?
- Ms. Berenice Hollis.

461
00:35:01,076 --> 00:35:04,329
Jerome Debney. At your service, Ms. Hollis.

462
00:35:04,413 --> 00:35:06,623
It's an honor, Mr. Debney.

463
00:35:07,624 --> 00:35:08,959
Please.

464
00:35:10,752 --> 00:35:13,588
May I be direct, in the modern way?

465
00:35:13,672 --> 00:35:17,175
Mr. Cassidy has brought us together.
Why, it doesn't matter.

466
00:35:17,259 --> 00:35:19,261
He's a collector.

467
00:35:19,344 --> 00:35:23,432
And collectors, as we both know,
are odd creatures.

468
00:35:23,515 --> 00:35:28,228
I assume an arrangement has been forged,
an agreement that suits you both.

469
00:35:28,312 --> 00:35:30,439
I don't really wish to know, no.

470
00:35:30,522 --> 00:35:32,649
One of the great pleasures
in being an artist

471
00:35:32,733 --> 00:35:36,778
is that one need not traffic with the world
in this fashion.

472
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:41,366
I presume that you would like an interview.

473
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:44,411
Tape recorder spinning away.

474
00:35:45,662 --> 00:35:47,706
I cannot abide such things.

475
00:35:48,874 --> 00:35:50,375
A conversation?

476
00:35:50,459 --> 00:35:53,587
Natural, informal.

477
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:57,174
This, perhaps, might be possible.
Nothing more.

478
00:35:57,257 --> 00:35:59,593
Would such an approach assuage you?

479
00:35:59,676 --> 00:36:01,637
That would mean the world to me.

480
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,765
The holy grail. Be the greatest honor.

481
00:36:04,848 --> 00:36:07,392
But should it come so easily?

482
00:36:08,393 --> 00:36:09,603
Excuse me?

483
00:36:09,686 --> 00:36:11,188
What have you suffered?

484
00:36:11,271 --> 00:36:13,774
The king invites you to his palace.

485
00:36:13,857 --> 00:36:16,526
You sun yourselves by its pool.

486
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:19,363
The grail approaches and presents itself.

487
00:36:19,446 --> 00:36:22,366
No battles, no trials.

488
00:36:22,449 --> 00:36:24,368
The gods would never approve.

489
00:36:24,451 --> 00:36:27,371
Mr. Debney, it was merely a metaphor.

490
00:36:27,454 --> 00:36:29,498
What power lurks in metaphors.

491
00:36:29,581 --> 00:36:31,917
- Are you a swimmer?
- I think...

492
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,921
One length, underwater,
and I'll speak with you.

493
00:36:36,004 --> 00:36:38,256
- But, Mr. Debney, I...
- Two lengths.

494
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:42,678
If your next word is anything but "yes,"
it'll be four lengths.

495
00:36:44,554 --> 00:36:46,181
Very well.

496
00:36:48,392 --> 00:36:51,436
My mother taught me how to haggle.

497
00:36:52,729 --> 00:36:55,816
If you have nothing to lose,
you must be merciless.

498
00:36:56,984 --> 00:36:58,151
Come.

499
00:36:58,235 --> 00:37:01,405
Sit beside me
and we'll cheer him on together.

500
00:37:03,615 --> 00:37:06,743
I didn't expect you to be so sociable,
Mr. Debney.

501
00:37:06,827 --> 00:37:11,290
One of the things I've learned
in my long stay upon this darkling plane,

502
00:37:11,373 --> 00:37:13,458
most things, most people,

503
00:37:13,542 --> 00:37:15,961
they are not what you'd expect.

504
00:37:20,257 --> 00:37:22,634
Are you what one might expect?

505
00:37:23,635 --> 00:37:25,387
What might that be?

506
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:26,513
A stone.

507
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:29,599
Perhaps an egg.

508
00:37:31,018 --> 00:37:32,686
The question being,

509
00:37:32,769 --> 00:37:35,647
how deep the hardness goes.

510
00:37:35,731 --> 00:37:39,151
We'd need to drop you to know for certain.

511
00:37:39,234 --> 00:37:41,403
Bravo! Halfway!

512
00:37:42,863 --> 00:37:45,407
- You're old friends?
- Freshly minted.

513
00:37:46,408 --> 00:37:48,577
He is an ambitious young man.

514
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,246
So if you are an egg,

515
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:53,040
I hope you'll be careful.

516
00:37:53,123 --> 00:37:55,042
Trust me, I'm anything but an egg.

517
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:57,919
Do you know the saddest egg of all?

518
00:37:58,003 --> 00:38:00,464
The egg that believes it's a stone.

519
00:38:02,341 --> 00:38:06,053
Is there anything I might say
that could dissuade you

520
00:38:06,136 --> 00:38:09,264
from writing about me in your magazine?

521
00:38:11,892 --> 00:38:14,227
I suspected as much.

522
00:38:14,311 --> 00:38:18,607
I go now where you are not welcome
to my studio for three hours.

523
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:23,111
After that, a boat ride, and you're welcome
to accompany me if you wish.

524
00:38:23,195 --> 00:38:25,614
After the boat ride, a shower

525
00:38:25,697 --> 00:38:27,574
and then dinner.

526
00:38:27,658 --> 00:38:29,576
For which you are also welcome.

527
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:33,121
The meal, not the shower.

528
00:38:33,205 --> 00:38:34,331
Is that acceptable?

529
00:38:40,087 --> 00:38:42,255
Such sweet sorrow.

530
00:38:48,512 --> 00:38:51,473
Did you find my blue under there?

531
00:38:54,309 --> 00:38:55,769
You okay, champ?

532
00:39:11,535 --> 00:39:14,037
How did you end up with such a pretty name?

533
00:39:15,038 --> 00:39:16,915
Waiting for me when I arrived.

534
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,794
Doesn't strike me
as a common choice in Minnesota.

535
00:39:20,877 --> 00:39:23,797
- We gonna dance to this tune again?
- Tell me.

536
00:39:24,965 --> 00:39:28,343
My mother bet my Aunt Sally
that I'd be a girl.

537
00:39:28,427 --> 00:39:30,887
Which I am, as you maybe noticed.

538
00:39:30,971 --> 00:39:34,349
So "Berenice," bringer of victory.

539
00:39:34,433 --> 00:39:36,602
What did they bet?

540
00:39:36,685 --> 00:39:39,730
- A new set of pickling jars.
- Oh, you're good.

541
00:39:39,813 --> 00:39:42,691
Lying's easy when you tell the truth.

542
00:39:44,026 --> 00:39:46,987
It's the quirky details that carry the day.

543
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:48,989
Aunt Sally, pickling jars.

544
00:39:49,072 --> 00:39:53,619
Nils vowing never to touch a brush again,
Nora dying of consumption.

545
00:39:54,703 --> 00:39:58,915
Want to know about Nora? Ask Debney.
He probably met her in Paris.

546
00:40:00,626 --> 00:40:03,003
Almost time for our boat ride.

547
00:40:05,213 --> 00:40:07,007
You're on your own for that.

548
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:09,593
If I don't rest, I can't make dinner.

549
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:13,680
What?

550
00:40:15,974 --> 00:40:18,185
We're not supposed to talk about it.
That's the deal?

551
00:40:18,268 --> 00:40:21,730
It's not so complicated, honeybunch.
I had a deadline, the pills helped.

552
00:40:21,813 --> 00:40:25,233
Then I started needing more,
then it wasn't about the deadlines anymore.

553
00:40:25,317 --> 00:40:26,693
I can end it. I just...

554
00:40:26,777 --> 00:40:29,029
I'm just waiting for the right moment.

555
00:40:29,112 --> 00:40:33,325
And I can certainly hear how that sounds,
and it's not like that.

556
00:40:37,913 --> 00:40:38,747
Yeah.

557
00:40:39,748 --> 00:40:42,834
You're probably right.
We shouldn't talk about it.

558
00:40:59,393 --> 00:41:00,894
Where is our Galahad?

559
00:41:00,978 --> 00:41:03,855
Resting. He sends his regrets.

560
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,944
I wore him out, didn't I?
With our little escapade.

561
00:41:09,027 --> 00:41:10,279
Where are you taking me?

562
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,367
<i>Come away, O human child!
To the waters and the wild</i>

563
00:42:31,485 --> 00:42:34,404
Did you know a woman named Nora Ingen?

564
00:42:38,033 --> 00:42:39,743
Nora.

565
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:45,874
The beautiful and broken Nora.

566
00:42:49,586 --> 00:42:51,129
What do you know of her?

567
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:54,091
Only what James told me.

568
00:42:55,092 --> 00:42:59,012
The concentration camps,
her brother painting the Germans,

569
00:42:59,096 --> 00:43:00,514
the flies.

570
00:43:00,597 --> 00:43:01,723
Flies?

571
00:43:04,476 --> 00:43:06,270
A fairy tale.

572
00:43:06,353 --> 00:43:11,024
- To give meaning where there was none.
- It's not true?

573
00:43:11,108 --> 00:43:14,361
The camps were not a place
where paintings were made.

574
00:43:14,444 --> 00:43:18,782
The idea of such a thing, it's obscene.

575
00:43:20,534 --> 00:43:22,619
Nils died like all the others.

576
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:25,580
Packed into a narrow room.

577
00:43:26,581 --> 00:43:27,791
Gassed.

578
00:43:27,874 --> 00:43:29,543
How do you know?

579
00:43:31,336 --> 00:43:33,422
- She told me.
- Nora?

580
00:43:34,423 --> 00:43:37,759
We were not very good to her,
the men in my circle.

581
00:43:37,843 --> 00:43:40,846
We passed her around like a talisman,

582
00:43:40,929 --> 00:43:46,893
daring ourselves to kiss
the tiny numbers tattooed on her forearm.

583
00:43:48,228 --> 00:43:50,230
We were callow

584
00:43:50,314 --> 00:43:52,649
when we should've been kind.

585
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:58,196
Now you know the worst of Jerome Debney.

586
00:43:59,406 --> 00:44:01,283
We're still friends?

587
00:44:01,366 --> 00:44:03,493
Of course, Mr. Debney.

588
00:44:03,577 --> 00:44:06,538
- We'll always be friends.
- Oh, wonderful.

589
00:44:06,622 --> 00:44:08,248
Wonderful.

590
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:54,438
A favorite spot of mine.

591
00:45:54,521 --> 00:45:57,274
One must labor to apprehend it.

592
00:45:57,357 --> 00:45:59,943
And those surely don't help.

593
00:46:01,403 --> 00:46:05,115
I try to think of them as regrets.

594
00:46:05,198 --> 00:46:08,327
One can either feel tormented

595
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:10,829
or learn to endure their presence.

596
00:46:10,912 --> 00:46:14,291
I obviously carry mine
less gracefully than you.

597
00:46:14,374 --> 00:46:16,710
Well, then you must tell me a secret.

598
00:46:16,793 --> 00:46:20,922
Something shameful.
It will ease your burden.

599
00:46:24,343 --> 00:46:25,844
I'm a teacher.

600
00:46:25,927 --> 00:46:28,472
And a fine one, I'm sure.

601
00:46:28,555 --> 00:46:30,932
- I made a mistake.
- What sort?

602
00:46:31,016 --> 00:46:33,268
An indiscretion with a colleague.

603
00:46:33,352 --> 00:46:34,436
Married, I assume?

604
00:46:38,315 --> 00:46:41,526
Every year, I have the freshmen girls
for health.

605
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:44,780
The facts of life, that kind of thing.

606
00:46:44,863 --> 00:46:46,615
How not to get pregnant.

607
00:46:47,616 --> 00:46:51,119
The teacher was not such a good student?

608
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:56,333
Officially, I'm on leave
to have a cyst removed.

609
00:46:57,834 --> 00:46:59,419
I have a friend, a best friend.

610
00:46:59,503 --> 00:47:01,672
She's older, married.

611
00:47:02,673 --> 00:47:03,966
Before I left, I told her everything,

612
00:47:04,049 --> 00:47:07,052
and there was this moment
when I was talking,

613
00:47:07,135 --> 00:47:09,262
and she gave me this look...

614
00:47:09,346 --> 00:47:11,682
It was just a flash, you know, reflexive.

615
00:47:11,765 --> 00:47:13,934
...like she wanted to spit on me.

616
00:47:14,935 --> 00:47:17,521
It stung. Keeps stinging.

617
00:47:18,522 --> 00:47:21,858
So when I got to Italy, I thought, "Why not?

618
00:47:21,942 --> 00:47:25,028
Play the whore for a little while.

619
00:47:25,112 --> 00:47:26,446
See how it feels."

620
00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:28,323
And does it suit you?

621
00:47:28,407 --> 00:47:29,449
This new mask?

622
00:47:31,702 --> 00:47:33,537
Turns out, I'm all right at it.

623
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:36,039
You have to be careful, my dear.

624
00:47:36,123 --> 00:47:38,208
A mask can be a perilous thing.

625
00:47:38,292 --> 00:47:41,628
When I take mine off at night,
another waits beneath.

626
00:47:41,712 --> 00:47:43,255
And under that?

627
00:47:44,589 --> 00:47:46,591
So many years, Ms. Hollis.

628
00:47:47,592 --> 00:47:49,136
Decades.

629
00:47:49,219 --> 00:47:53,765
And it's masks all the way down by now.

630
00:47:58,270 --> 00:47:59,896
And you?

631
00:48:01,231 --> 00:48:03,483
Is there anything left?

632
00:48:07,404 --> 00:48:09,031
I think so.

633
00:48:09,114 --> 00:48:11,074
Then it's not too late, is it?

634
00:50:25,626 --> 00:50:27,294
James?

635
00:50:32,007 --> 00:50:34,384
Sky's still standing, Chicken Little.

636
00:50:34,468 --> 00:50:36,094
Just slipped on the stairs.

637
00:50:37,095 --> 00:50:39,931
Tell Papa all about the boat ride.

638
00:50:40,932 --> 00:50:43,810
I think I lost 3 pounds to mosquitoes.

639
00:50:44,811 --> 00:50:47,648
But I like him. He's a fine old man.

640
00:50:47,731 --> 00:50:50,734
- What did you two lovebirds talk about?
- This and that.

641
00:50:50,817 --> 00:50:54,446
- Not the other thing?
- Never on a first date.

642
00:50:54,529 --> 00:50:56,865
What kind of girl you take me for?

643
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:00,327
Seemed to think I should tell you the truth.

644
00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:02,579
- About what?
- Myself.

645
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:05,624
And what would that be?

646
00:51:05,707 --> 00:51:08,251
Small-town girl, made a mistake.

647
00:51:08,335 --> 00:51:12,005
In way over her head,
paddling about with sharks like you.

648
00:51:13,006 --> 00:51:15,592
- Little Bo-Peep, huh?
- Pretty much.

649
00:51:16,593 --> 00:51:19,096
Tell it to Aunt Sally.

650
00:51:32,067 --> 00:51:34,152
Aren't you the little lady?

651
00:51:34,236 --> 00:51:36,363
Bit late for that, turns out.

652
00:51:36,446 --> 00:51:38,365
Did I miss any local sights?

653
00:51:38,448 --> 00:51:40,450
He took me to some ruins.

654
00:51:40,534 --> 00:51:43,328
- Just up the lake?
- Just outside the property.

655
00:51:43,412 --> 00:51:46,164
Felt like the first person to set foot there
in a hundred years.

656
00:51:46,248 --> 00:51:49,334
It scares me to think of him
out there alone, though, on the water.

657
00:51:49,418 --> 00:51:51,003
Why?

658
00:51:52,629 --> 00:51:54,840
He capsizes, no one will ever find him.

659
00:51:54,923 --> 00:51:57,342
Probably what he wants,
vanish without a trace.

660
00:51:57,426 --> 00:51:59,303
Be the perfect close to his legend.

661
00:51:59,386 --> 00:52:02,597
Nobody wants to end up
at the bottom of a lake, chief.

662
00:52:09,313 --> 00:52:10,522
Thank you.

663
00:52:10,606 --> 00:52:11,940
Do me a favor?

664
00:52:12,024 --> 00:52:13,400
What are friends for?

665
00:52:13,483 --> 00:52:17,988
Tonight, when we're at his house, I need
to take a photo of whatever he's working on.

666
00:52:18,071 --> 00:52:21,033
- Can you distract him a bit, please?
- Why?

667
00:52:21,116 --> 00:52:23,994
- There's no way he's ever gonna...
- Why do you need to take a picture?

668
00:52:24,077 --> 00:52:27,164
For my work, for my writing, reference.

669
00:52:27,247 --> 00:52:30,042
Seems kind of underhanded, don't you think?

670
00:52:30,125 --> 00:52:32,127
Underhanded?

671
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:33,920
He's inviting us into his home.

672
00:52:34,004 --> 00:52:37,841
It's a memory aid, Pollyanna.
I'll delete it when I'm done.

673
00:52:38,842 --> 00:52:41,595
What makes you think
he's gonna show you anything anyway?

674
00:52:42,596 --> 00:52:45,515
My irresistible charisma.

675
00:52:46,642 --> 00:52:48,685
<i>No, Mr. Figueras.</i>

676
00:52:48,769 --> 00:52:51,104
No, no, no.

677
00:52:51,188 --> 00:52:52,731
It's a ridicule.

678
00:52:52,814 --> 00:52:55,901
Why ruin a pleasant evening?

679
00:52:55,984 --> 00:52:58,278
Let us finish our meal.

680
00:52:58,362 --> 00:53:01,406
I'll pretend you never raised the idea,

681
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:02,991
and we'll all part as friends.

682
00:53:03,075 --> 00:53:05,869
You have a duty, Mr. Debney.

683
00:53:05,953 --> 00:53:08,246
- To whom?
- Posterity.

684
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:11,541
When you've departed,
the world will come rushing in.

685
00:53:11,625 --> 00:53:14,586
Wouldn't it be better
to share your work now, with me,

686
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:16,546
while you're still here to explain it?

687
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:19,591
I can help you do this. Together, we...

688
00:53:20,592 --> 00:53:23,595
What is the earliest example of art
you can think of?

689
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,765
The caves, I suppose. Lascaux, Altamira.

690
00:53:28,392 --> 00:53:31,186
Odd place to paint, wouldn't you agree?

691
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:32,896
A hole in the ground?

692
00:53:33,897 --> 00:53:36,233
Can you explain the impulse?

693
00:53:36,316 --> 00:53:38,360
Well, it's a long way
from my field of expertise,

694
00:53:38,443 --> 00:53:41,446
but I suppose there's
some sort of ritualized element here.

695
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:45,659
I mean, the womb, Mother Earth,
a descent into...

696
00:53:45,742 --> 00:53:48,120
I have a much simpler hypothesis.

697
00:53:48,203 --> 00:53:51,081
They had no desire to share their work.

698
00:53:51,164 --> 00:53:54,876
They were hiding it
from eyes they considered unworthy.

699
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,421
But I suppose you could also say
it was a way

700
00:53:57,504 --> 00:54:01,008
of safeguarding the paintings
for future generations.

701
00:54:02,009 --> 00:54:05,721
After all, their work was discovered,
just as yours shall be.

702
00:54:05,804 --> 00:54:10,809
And I'll be there to write of it,
Mr. Debney, with you or without you.

703
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:21,737
He's such an earnest young man.

704
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:26,617
To speak so seriously
of such foolish matters.

705
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:29,620
Oh, nothing could be less foolish.

706
00:54:30,621 --> 00:54:33,707
Come. Let me show you my studio.

707
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:35,709
Are you serious?

708
00:54:35,792 --> 00:54:37,502
I think you'll be quite amused.

709
00:54:37,586 --> 00:54:40,047
- Both of us?
- Everyone.

710
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:41,715
It's time.

711
00:54:41,798 --> 00:54:43,258
Past time.

712
00:54:44,259 --> 00:54:45,385
- Take this.
- What?

713
00:54:45,469 --> 00:54:47,304
When I give you the nod, drop it.

714
00:54:47,387 --> 00:54:49,306
- What...?
- Trust me.

715
00:54:51,141 --> 00:54:54,144
We have to be rather fleet of foot,
I'm afraid.

716
00:54:54,227 --> 00:54:57,439
I have a rendezvous this evening.
With a local widow.

717
00:54:57,522 --> 00:55:00,025
And I can write about this,
what you show us?

718
00:55:00,108 --> 00:55:01,360
You have my blessing.

719
00:55:01,443 --> 00:55:05,572
Indeed, I'll be rather intrigued
to learn what you make of it.

720
00:55:05,656 --> 00:55:08,241
This is everything, you understand.

721
00:55:08,325 --> 00:55:10,869
Nothing else exists.

722
00:55:26,927 --> 00:55:30,931
This one has been quite tricky.
I'd value your insight.

723
00:55:32,099 --> 00:55:34,059
Too much blue?

724
00:55:35,352 --> 00:55:38,438
- I don't understand.
- Those are finished.

725
00:55:38,522 --> 00:55:39,940
More or less.

726
00:55:40,023 --> 00:55:43,443
Though if the muse calls, I return.

727
00:55:45,946 --> 00:55:48,198
But, Mr. Debney, there's nothing here.

728
00:55:48,282 --> 00:55:49,741
No?

729
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,625
The blue.

730
00:55:59,626 --> 00:56:01,378
I keep thinking too much.

731
00:56:02,421 --> 00:56:04,589
Mr. Debney, I...

732
00:56:06,091 --> 00:56:09,219
You know of the fire, the first,
at the gallery in Paris?

733
00:56:09,303 --> 00:56:10,762
Yes, of course.

734
00:56:11,888 --> 00:56:16,101
For three weeks,
the world picked up Jerome Debney,

735
00:56:16,184 --> 00:56:19,438
turned him this way and that,
covered him with words.

736
00:56:20,897 --> 00:56:24,484
I'll be honest,
I thought I was quite the success.

737
00:56:24,568 --> 00:56:28,405
- A genius, even.
- You were. Are.

738
00:56:29,489 --> 00:56:33,535
A carelessly discarded cigarette.

739
00:56:33,619 --> 00:56:34,911
In less than an hour...

740
00:56:35,912 --> 00:56:37,331
nothing.

741
00:56:37,414 --> 00:56:40,417
You would've thought I'd lost a loved one,
how I was treated.

742
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:44,504
Letters of condolence, mournful embraces.

743
00:56:45,505 --> 00:56:48,300
And yet, in my heart...

744
00:56:49,301 --> 00:56:51,094
a great burden lifted.

745
00:56:52,095 --> 00:56:55,932
All those words, all those opinions,

746
00:56:56,016 --> 00:56:58,810
that was the meaning of the empty frame.

747
00:56:58,894 --> 00:57:00,270
It was a joke.

748
00:57:00,354 --> 00:57:03,023
Fill this with your chatter.

749
00:57:03,106 --> 00:57:05,317
And look how they did with it.

750
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:08,528
- I've seen it on a T-shirt.
- Yeah.

751
00:57:08,612 --> 00:57:10,656
From then on in,

752
00:57:10,739 --> 00:57:13,075
there was no one who could make my work

753
00:57:13,158 --> 00:57:15,494
anything other than what it was.

754
00:57:16,495 --> 00:57:19,039
It was Eden, Mr. Figueras.

755
00:57:19,122 --> 00:57:21,291
For nearly 50 years,

756
00:57:21,375 --> 00:57:24,169
I walked naked in the garden.

757
00:57:24,252 --> 00:57:25,712
And then one morning,

758
00:57:26,713 --> 00:57:28,298
I woke with a pain.

759
00:57:29,299 --> 00:57:30,592
Here.

760
00:57:31,593 --> 00:57:33,136
It was nothing.

761
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:35,347
Indigestion.

762
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:38,433
But it reminded me of the serpent.

763
00:57:38,517 --> 00:57:41,103
The serpent that lurks in all our gardens.

764
00:57:42,145 --> 00:57:45,440
One day, Jerome Debney...

765
00:57:45,524 --> 00:57:47,609
will be no more.

766
00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:51,822
And the world, as you so astutely put it,

767
00:57:51,905 --> 00:57:53,573
will come rushing in.

768
00:57:54,574 --> 00:57:56,159
You burned the villa.

769
00:57:57,202 --> 00:57:59,955
I wish you could've seen the colors,
my dear.

770
00:58:00,998 --> 00:58:03,792
The flames feeding on the paint.

771
00:58:03,875 --> 00:58:05,711
It was quite lovely, I assure you.

772
00:58:05,794 --> 00:58:08,547
Jesus fucking Christ.

773
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:09,673
Now...

774
00:58:11,091 --> 00:58:12,134
every morning...

775
00:58:13,135 --> 00:58:17,139
I take the palette, the brush,

776
00:58:17,222 --> 00:58:18,682
and I paint.

777
00:58:19,683 --> 00:58:21,435
Without the paint.

778
00:58:22,436 --> 00:58:25,731
I have become my own cave.

779
00:58:25,814 --> 00:58:28,900
A deep breath, young man, it will pass.

780
00:58:28,984 --> 00:58:30,068
You're a thief.

781
00:58:31,194 --> 00:58:34,781
Your work belongs to the world,
the entire fucking world,

782
00:58:34,865 --> 00:58:36,992
and you've stolen it.

783
00:58:37,075 --> 00:58:38,660
It's despicable.

784
00:58:40,203 --> 00:58:41,788
I think somehow you might be right.

785
00:58:43,165 --> 00:58:46,918
The blue, it does seem a little off somehow.

786
00:58:48,295 --> 00:58:50,714
- Along the bottom, no?
- Right.

787
00:58:50,797 --> 00:58:53,216
You have an excellent eye.

788
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:55,469
There's writing on the back.

789
00:58:55,552 --> 00:58:57,262
When I'm truly finished,

790
00:58:57,346 --> 00:59:01,558
I scrawl the title,
the date and my initials.

791
00:59:01,642 --> 00:59:03,560
For posterity's sake, you understand.

792
00:59:03,644 --> 00:59:05,771
<i>"The Burnt Orange Heresy."</i>

793
00:59:05,854 --> 00:59:08,106
- A favorite.
- What does it mean?

794
00:59:08,190 --> 00:59:12,069
It's a bone tossed to the critics,
those ravenous dogs.

795
00:59:12,152 --> 00:59:14,655
They can wear themselves out chewing on it.

796
00:59:14,738 --> 00:59:16,949
Searching for meaning where there is none.

797
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:21,662
I'll wait outside.
I'm sorry, sir, but I... I...

798
00:59:21,745 --> 00:59:23,330
I lack the stomach for this.

799
00:59:24,498 --> 00:59:26,208
James.

800
00:59:26,291 --> 00:59:30,295
Leave him. He has wounds to lick.

801
00:59:58,156 --> 01:00:01,827
I'm afraid I must part ways
with you here, my dear.

802
01:00:02,828 --> 01:00:05,080
If I tarry much longer,

803
01:00:05,163 --> 01:00:07,749
the widow will have gone to sleep.

804
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:11,253
I wish you much happiness, my dear,

805
01:00:11,336 --> 01:00:13,588
and a long life in which to enjoy it.

806
01:00:14,631 --> 01:00:18,760
It's been an honor
and an even greater pleasure.

807
01:00:19,761 --> 01:00:22,889
I know you're an unhappy young man
right now.

808
01:00:22,973 --> 01:00:26,518
But I believe in time, you will understand.

809
01:00:26,602 --> 01:00:28,020
Yeah.

810
01:00:31,189 --> 01:00:32,274
Good night.

811
01:01:06,975 --> 01:01:08,727
Still friends, partner?

812
01:01:09,728 --> 01:01:11,813
Hey, I'm sorry, but that was a shock.

813
01:01:11,897 --> 01:01:15,067
Got your scoop, didn't you?
It's not the one you thought.

814
01:01:16,068 --> 01:01:17,194
Fuck.

815
01:01:17,277 --> 01:01:19,196
- What?
- I forgot my bag.

816
01:01:19,279 --> 01:01:21,406
- Oh, I'll come with you.
- No, no, no. Wait.

817
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:23,408
Go pack and meet me by the car.

818
01:01:23,492 --> 01:01:24,493
The car?

819
01:01:24,576 --> 01:01:27,371
Listen, I need to write this now,
and I can't do that here, so...

820
01:01:27,454 --> 01:01:31,124
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I am serious. Please, do it.

821
01:01:31,208 --> 01:01:33,126
Promise, I'll make it up to you.

822
01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:34,252
Okay?

823
01:05:37,829 --> 01:05:38,664
What?

824
01:05:39,665 --> 01:05:42,459
Hey, train's leaving. Get on it. Come on.

825
01:06:30,632 --> 01:06:34,678
Embers, ashes, afterglow.

826
01:06:35,721 --> 01:06:40,225
Into the good night. Into the gentle night.

827
01:06:40,309 --> 01:06:44,021
Debney. Embers, ashes, acceptance.

828
01:06:44,104 --> 01:06:46,857
Demurral and acceptance.

829
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:52,195
Debney. Demurral and acceptance.

830
01:06:53,238 --> 01:06:55,866
Acting a little strange, boss.

831
01:06:56,867 --> 01:06:58,410
How long have you known me?

832
01:06:59,411 --> 01:07:01,246
A few days.

833
01:07:02,456 --> 01:07:08,879
So how can you possibly say
what's strange and what's normal?

834
01:07:19,348 --> 01:07:21,350
Home sweet home.

835
01:08:31,003 --> 01:08:33,838
- Where are you going?
- Gotta get writing.

836
01:08:33,922 --> 01:08:34,756
Now?

837
01:08:35,757 --> 01:08:37,426
Well, when the muse calls...

838
01:08:38,552 --> 01:08:40,262
Come on, be a good girl.

839
01:11:26,970 --> 01:11:28,096
Mr. Cassidy.

840
01:11:29,097 --> 01:11:31,183
<i>It seems there's been a fire
on my estate, James.</i>

841
01:11:31,266 --> 01:11:33,352
Yes. Yes, sir. That... That's right.

842
01:11:33,435 --> 01:11:36,188
- That is right.
- <i>Debney's studio?</i>

843
01:11:37,189 --> 01:11:39,191
Yes. Yes, I'm afraid so.

844
01:11:39,274 --> 01:11:44,363
Will you please assure me that this happened
after you procured the painting?

845
01:11:44,446 --> 01:11:46,156
It did. It did.

846
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:50,994
So my painting is the only Debney
in existence, then. Right?

847
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:55,040
Yes, I suppose
you could say that, sir, yeah.

848
01:11:55,123 --> 01:11:57,292
<i>And Debney, he's...?</i>

849
01:11:57,376 --> 01:11:59,169
He was away for the evening.

850
01:11:59,252 --> 01:12:02,214
I mean, how much more
can he really paint? I mean, he's old.

851
01:12:02,297 --> 01:12:05,842
- He is old.
- <i>Oh, send me a text of it, can you?</i>

852
01:12:06,969 --> 01:12:08,845
No, no, no. I can't do that. It's in my car.

853
01:12:08,929 --> 01:12:13,100
It's hidden, and I can't risk taking it out.
Ms. Hollis is still with me.

854
01:12:14,101 --> 01:12:16,937
<i>Well, can you describe it to me, then?</i>

855
01:12:21,316 --> 01:12:25,237
Well, it's... It's kind of hard to describe,
to be honest.

856
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:28,907
<i>Well, it's your bloody job
describing pictures, isn't it?</i>

857
01:12:34,329 --> 01:12:35,872
<i>James?</i>

858
01:12:37,499 --> 01:12:41,086
It's called <i>The Burnt Orange Heresy.</i>

859
01:12:42,129 --> 01:12:43,130
It's orange?

860
01:12:43,213 --> 01:12:44,965
<i>It's burnt orange.</i>

861
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:47,968
Like the sun.

862
01:12:49,219 --> 01:12:51,430
Like the setting sun.

863
01:12:52,848 --> 01:12:55,642
It's a self-portrait, really. It is.

864
01:12:55,726 --> 01:12:57,102
It's...

865
01:12:57,185 --> 01:13:01,231
<i>the artist, alone in the empyrean,</i>

866
01:13:01,315 --> 01:13:04,985
<i>descending toward a final horizon.</i>

867
01:13:07,404 --> 01:13:09,781
<i>In full acceptance.</i>

868
01:13:11,241 --> 01:13:14,870
<i>That's fantastic, James. Fantastic.</i>

869
01:13:16,246 --> 01:13:17,748
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

870
01:13:19,458 --> 01:13:21,084
<i>Thank you.</i>

871
01:14:35,784 --> 01:14:38,036
Tell me why this isn't a terrible thing.

872
01:14:39,037 --> 01:14:41,873
- It's not what it looks like.
- What does it look like?

873
01:14:42,874 --> 01:14:44,376
What does it look like, James?

874
01:14:44,459 --> 01:14:46,837
Listen to me for a second.

875
01:14:47,838 --> 01:14:51,425
That lecture for those tourists, right?

876
01:14:51,508 --> 01:14:55,637
I do that 20, 30 times a year,
200 euros a pop,

877
01:14:55,721 --> 01:14:57,139
in Milan or Florence or Rome,

878
01:14:57,222 --> 01:14:59,391
and it's the same blank-faced
American tourists

879
01:14:59,474 --> 01:15:02,686
with the same stupid fucking questions
every time about Raphael and da Vinci,

880
01:15:02,769 --> 01:15:05,647
as if no one else ever painted anything.

881
01:15:05,731 --> 01:15:10,068
Debney is stealing from me. Yes, he is.
And from you and from everybody.

882
01:15:10,152 --> 01:15:11,862
This isn't who you are, slick.

883
01:15:11,945 --> 01:15:16,366
Pumpkin, you haven't
the slightest idea who I am.

884
01:15:17,701 --> 01:15:19,411
You know what we need to do.

885
01:15:19,494 --> 01:15:21,079
What?

886
01:15:21,163 --> 01:15:22,998
We need to get rid of that awful painting.

887
01:15:23,081 --> 01:15:25,417
- No. Don't you dare.
- Let go, James.

888
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:27,210
- Don't you dare.
- You're hurting me!

889
01:15:27,294 --> 01:15:31,256
Have you any idea how valuable that is?
That's the only Debney in the world.

890
01:15:32,257 --> 01:15:34,134
Why is he paying you?

891
01:15:34,217 --> 01:15:35,552
Who?

892
01:15:35,636 --> 01:15:38,472
- Cassidy. To spy on me?
- That was a dream.

893
01:15:38,555 --> 01:15:41,350
- You said that was a dream.
- Please go tell him. Tell him.

894
01:15:42,351 --> 01:15:46,355
He won't believe you because
he wants it to be real. And it is real.

895
01:15:46,438 --> 01:15:48,607
Do you know what's gonna happen now?

896
01:15:48,690 --> 01:15:51,193
You're gonna get out of my apartment.

897
01:15:51,276 --> 01:15:53,111
You're gonna get out of my life and go back

898
01:15:53,195 --> 01:15:55,697
to your cheap whoring
and sucking and fucking your...

899
01:15:55,781 --> 01:15:58,200
- We're through here.
- Motherfucker!

900
01:16:29,940 --> 01:16:31,441
Fuck.

901
01:18:23,637 --> 01:18:25,055
No, no, no. Come on.

902
01:18:25,138 --> 01:18:26,807
Easy.

903
01:18:27,808 --> 01:18:29,226
Easy.

904
01:18:33,605 --> 01:18:35,399
No, no, no.

905
01:18:42,030 --> 01:18:43,865
I'm really, really sorry.

906
01:18:45,325 --> 01:18:47,703
It was an accident, okay?

907
01:18:49,663 --> 01:18:51,123
You...

908
01:18:52,457 --> 01:18:54,501
You scared me.

909
01:18:56,503 --> 01:18:58,880
I know. I'm sorry.

910
01:19:00,090 --> 01:19:02,175
You hurt me.

911
01:19:03,218 --> 01:19:04,928
I didn't mean to.

912
01:19:05,929 --> 01:19:09,766
It was an accident, okay? It's over.

913
01:19:11,059 --> 01:19:13,937
Okay? It's over.

914
01:19:18,025 --> 01:19:20,277
I'm so, so sorry.

915
01:19:27,951 --> 01:19:29,703
Can you stand up?

916
01:19:31,288 --> 01:19:33,540
Get you back to the apartment.

917
01:19:34,541 --> 01:19:36,084
Okay?

918
01:19:39,379 --> 01:19:41,173
Give me your hand.

919
01:19:48,472 --> 01:19:50,432
I'm so, so sorry.

920
01:19:51,433 --> 01:19:53,060
Come here.

921
01:19:54,895 --> 01:19:56,104
We're okay?

922
01:19:57,105 --> 01:19:58,607
Come on.

923
01:19:58,690 --> 01:20:00,233
You can do this.

924
01:20:00,317 --> 01:20:02,069
It's gonna be fine.

925
01:20:12,579 --> 01:20:14,331
I'm sorry.

926
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:18,877
You do know that, right? How sorry I am.

927
01:20:21,797 --> 01:20:24,091
I could buy you a plane ticket.

928
01:20:25,342 --> 01:20:26,885
How will that sound?

929
01:20:27,886 --> 01:20:30,597
First class, anywhere you want to go.

930
01:20:30,681 --> 01:20:34,476
He's paying you. Cassidy.

931
01:20:34,559 --> 01:20:39,731
Oh, no. No, no, no, it's not like that.
He's letting me write about it.

932
01:20:40,899 --> 01:20:45,153
It's actually the opportunity of a lifetime,
to take a Debney, to be allowed...

933
01:20:45,237 --> 01:20:47,239
It's not real, James.

934
01:20:50,659 --> 01:20:53,370
It is so real.

935
01:20:59,918 --> 01:21:01,878
Please get dressed.

936
01:21:02,879 --> 01:21:05,257
You can't even see it, can you?

937
01:21:06,258 --> 01:21:07,426
I can help you.

938
01:21:07,509 --> 01:21:09,177
We're wasting time.

939
01:21:09,261 --> 01:21:11,305
Will you let me help you?

940
01:21:12,556 --> 01:21:14,641
Please, we need to get you
to the airport, and I...

941
01:21:14,725 --> 01:21:16,351
Where's the fly?

942
01:21:20,856 --> 01:21:22,733
Shouldn't there be a fly?

943
01:21:23,734 --> 01:21:26,236
Oh, I need you to be quiet now,
Ms. Hollis, please.

944
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:29,281
- Do you understand?
- Or is that you?

945
01:21:30,282 --> 01:21:33,827
- Be quiet...
- That's why you tell the story, isn't it?

946
01:21:33,910 --> 01:21:37,789
- I'm... I'm not...
- You're the fly, and you fucking know it.

947
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:40,083
Please be quiet.

948
01:21:40,167 --> 01:21:43,962
You're a fraud, a fake. Buzzing about.

949
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:51,845
Be quiet, please.

950
01:21:54,014 --> 01:21:56,600
It's not real, James.

951
01:21:58,810 --> 01:22:00,771
You're not real.

952
01:25:40,824 --> 01:25:44,911
Legendary artist Jerome Debney
has died at the age of 84.

953
01:25:44,995 --> 01:25:46,747
Debney reportedly suffered a heart attack

954
01:25:46,830 --> 01:25:49,916
at the estate of art dealer Joseph Cassidy
on Lake Como.

955
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,462
The empty frame represented freedom.

956
01:25:53,545 --> 01:25:58,842
It represented a new way to see.
It opened up a way to see.

957
01:26:05,515 --> 01:26:08,477
<i>Reclusive painter Jerome Debney
has died today of a heart attack.</i>

958
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:10,228
<i>The artist had just turned 84.</i>

959
01:26:10,312 --> 01:26:13,774
It's like that,
the disappearance of the act.

960
01:26:13,857 --> 01:26:18,820
The essence of Debney's,
I would say, greatness as an artist.

961
01:26:18,904 --> 01:26:21,740
Debney's long career was blighted
by a series of accidental fires,

962
01:26:21,823 --> 01:26:25,035
<i>destroying a gallery in Paris,
his villa in the south of France,</i>

963
01:26:25,118 --> 01:26:28,080
<i>and most recently,
his studio on the Cassidy estate.</i>

964
01:26:28,163 --> 01:26:31,333
Art critic James Figueras,
who recently visited Debney's studio

965
01:26:31,416 --> 01:26:34,419
and is the only critic to have examined
Debney's late work, says that:

966
01:26:34,503 --> 01:26:36,046
"Both as a man and an artist,

967
01:26:36,129 --> 01:26:40,133
Debney possessed the sincerity, depth
and unflinching directness of a prophet.

968
01:26:40,217 --> 01:26:43,011
<i>He was a voice calling out in the desert."</i>

969
01:27:09,413 --> 01:27:10,455
Thank you.

970
01:27:10,539 --> 01:27:12,499
- Thank you so much. Bye.
- Thank you.

971
01:27:13,667 --> 01:27:15,961
Well done, James. Good work.

972
01:27:16,044 --> 01:27:17,296
Excuse me?

973
01:27:17,379 --> 01:27:21,091
Your essay, the real thing.
I mean, so rare nowadays.

974
01:27:22,092 --> 01:27:24,678
I sent an invitation to your friend.

975
01:27:24,761 --> 01:27:27,639
- My friend?
- Yes, you know, Berenice.

976
01:27:27,723 --> 01:27:29,558
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

977
01:27:29,641 --> 01:27:33,395
I had to get a professional acquaintance
to do a bit of research

978
01:27:33,478 --> 01:27:35,856
because she seems to have disappeared.

979
01:27:37,774 --> 01:27:40,861
Difficult thing to do, really, disappear.

980
01:27:40,944 --> 01:27:44,448
- Usually, you need a bit of help.
- What do you mean?

981
01:27:44,531 --> 01:27:48,493
Well, you know, with anything complicated,
you need a bit of assistance.

982
01:27:48,577 --> 01:27:52,205
Bloke I know tried it years ago.
Got into a bit of a scrape.

983
01:27:52,289 --> 01:27:55,459
- Not quite as easy as you think.
- No.

984
01:27:55,542 --> 01:27:58,670
- Lost touch with her, have you?
- Yes. You might say that, yeah.

985
01:27:58,754 --> 01:28:02,716
Yeah. Young love. So volatile.

986
01:28:02,799 --> 01:28:06,637
Yeah. Suppose you had
to sacrifice her to your work.

987
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:11,016
Art can be such a harsh mistress, can't she?

988
01:28:11,099 --> 01:28:12,517
Oh, she can.

989
01:28:13,518 --> 01:28:16,355
Let's mingle a bit, shall we? Come.

990
01:28:18,023 --> 01:28:20,817
Duluth seemed a bit unlikely,
didn't it really?

991
01:28:20,901 --> 01:28:22,069
In which way?

992
01:28:22,152 --> 01:28:26,198
Well, you know, that's where
she was from, really. Just like she said.

993
01:28:26,281 --> 01:28:28,909
Tiny town south of the city.

994
01:28:28,992 --> 01:28:33,538
Lived with her mother and an aunt.
Taught school, if you can imagine that.

995
01:28:34,539 --> 01:28:37,000
- Do you want a drink?
- No, thanks.

996
01:28:37,084 --> 01:28:38,627
No, thanks very much.

997
01:28:40,504 --> 01:28:42,839
I think he might have sent her a drawing.

998
01:28:42,923 --> 01:28:44,675
- Who?
- Debney.

999
01:28:44,758 --> 01:28:45,801
What do you mean?

1000
01:28:45,884 --> 01:28:51,390
Her mother said she received
a drawing of Berenice, postmark Italy.

1001
01:28:52,891 --> 01:28:55,269
I was a bit upset about that,
as you can imagine.

1002
01:28:55,352 --> 01:28:56,436
Yeah.

1003
01:28:56,520 --> 01:29:00,065
Till I found out it wasn't signed
and so it's bloody worthless.

1004
01:29:00,148 --> 01:29:01,984
- Such a shame.
- Oh, yes. What a shame.

1005
01:29:02,067 --> 01:29:03,026
Such a shame.

1006
01:29:04,027 --> 01:29:07,698
I wouldn't worry too much. I mean, she'll
float back into view one of these days.

1007
01:29:07,781 --> 01:29:10,200
I mean, they always do. Yeah.

1008
01:29:10,284 --> 01:29:11,285
Here we are.

1009
01:29:11,368 --> 01:29:13,912
The jewel in the crown.

1010
01:29:15,539 --> 01:29:17,541
You can't smoke in here, James, sorry.

1011
01:29:18,542 --> 01:29:20,460
Oh, I almost forgot.

1012
01:29:20,544 --> 01:29:23,922
This was found in Debney's desk
after he drowned.

1013
01:29:26,008 --> 01:29:27,759
I thought he died of a heart attack.

1014
01:29:27,843 --> 01:29:30,554
Take a pick, one of the two.
I mean, he was in the pool anyway.

1015
01:29:30,637 --> 01:29:32,014
Was he swimming?

1016
01:29:32,097 --> 01:29:34,725
Well, he fell in somehow.
I mean, Rodolfo found him.

1017
01:29:34,808 --> 01:29:37,561
He was all bloated and blue in the face.

1018
01:29:37,644 --> 01:29:40,981
A bit upsetting, really. Hang on a minute.

1019
01:29:41,064 --> 01:29:44,359
Just gonna take this
from <i>The Guardian.</i> Hello?

1020
01:29:45,777 --> 01:29:49,740
James Figueras. Evelina Macri from <i>ARTnews.</i>

1021
01:29:49,823 --> 01:29:50,907
Hello.

1022
01:29:50,991 --> 01:29:52,951
First of all, brilliant job.

1023
01:29:53,035 --> 01:29:55,579
Your restraint is what I found
most extraordinary.

1024
01:29:55,662 --> 01:29:59,666
It's as if you wrote an essay on the solar
system and refused to mention the sun.

1025
01:30:00,959 --> 01:30:04,463
A lesser critic would've hung
his whole thesis on it.

1026
01:30:04,546 --> 01:30:07,716
But you chose to leave it for us
to discover.

1027
01:30:07,799 --> 01:30:09,259
To be shocked by, even.

1028
01:30:09,343 --> 01:30:13,138
- Thank you.
- The ultimate mark of Debney.

1029
01:30:13,221 --> 01:30:16,850
Hidden right in the center of things,
as the truth always is.

1030
01:30:16,934 --> 01:30:22,230
Almost as if he imprinted the mark of Cain
on his own forehead, don't you think?

1031
01:30:22,314 --> 01:30:24,608
Or is that too big a reach?

1032
01:30:25,609 --> 01:30:26,526
Excuse me?

1033
01:30:27,861 --> 01:30:29,529
The fingerprint.

1034
01:30:50,467 --> 01:30:52,219
James.

1035
01:30:52,302 --> 01:30:54,846
James. James, come meet Philip Ricciardi.

1036
01:30:54,930 --> 01:30:57,182
From the Tate Modern.
You'll really like him.

1037
01:30:57,265 --> 01:30:59,393
- You know, don't you?
- Know what?

1038
01:30:59,476 --> 01:31:01,645
- Just say it.
- Say what?

1039
01:31:01,728 --> 01:31:03,397
The truth.

1040
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:05,232
- The truth, James?
- Yes.

1041
01:31:05,315 --> 01:31:08,694
The truth. Come on.

1042
01:31:08,777 --> 01:31:11,071
- Philip. Oh, hello.
- Joseph.

1043
01:31:11,154 --> 01:31:13,282
- You know James?
- James. Of course.

1044
01:31:14,283 --> 01:31:15,742
Evelina.

1045
01:31:36,513 --> 01:31:38,598
Mr. Figueras.

1046
01:31:40,225 --> 01:31:41,351
Thank you.

1047
01:31:55,490 --> 01:31:56,950
<i>Over the weekend, really at worst,</i>

1048
01:31:57,034 --> 01:31:59,286
<i>we're gonna have
just a nuisance round of flurries,</i>

1049
01:31:59,369 --> 01:32:01,496
<i>particularly in Central Minnesota,</i>

1050
01:32:01,580 --> 01:32:04,458
<i>with the real snow starting
either late Sunday night</i>

1051
01:32:04,541 --> 01:32:06,668
<i>or in the predawn hours of Monday.</i>

1052
01:32:06,752 --> 01:32:10,505
<i>It'll be a heavy, wet-consistency snow,
accompanied by wind,</i>

1053
01:32:10,589 --> 01:32:14,426
<i>coming out during the day Monday,
gusts at 30 or 35 miles an hour.</i>

1054
01:32:14,509 --> 01:32:17,054
<i>And this type of storm track favors</i>

1055
01:32:17,137 --> 01:32:21,224
<i>a narrow swath of 8 to 12 inches of snow.</i>
