小伙子們  千萬不要亂跑

有些小徑綿延數里遠

我不覺得這是個好點子

00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,200
那是什麼聲音？

- 阿爾弗雷德  你找到了什麼嗎？ - 還沒有

11
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,770
那就繼續挖
Then keep digging.

12
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,810
那小鬼找到東西了
The kid's got something!

Look at that!

16
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,330
- 我們要發財了  - 閉嘴
- We're rich! We're rich!    - Shut up. Shut up.

17
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,490
我們要發財了 是不是？
Well, we're rich, ain't we?

18
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,830
印第

00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,090
印第安納...
Indiana? Indiana?

猶他州  1912年

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,300
我們得找到其他的東西

24
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,430
這是科羅芮多的十字架
It's the Cross of Coronado.

25
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,480
科爾特斯人1520年送他的禮物
Cortez gave it to him in 1520.

26
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:57,820
我要把這枚戒指送給我媽  把它戴在她瘦巴巴的手指頭上
I'm thinkin' about raisin' my dead mama, dig down and put it on her bony finger!

27
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,990
那個十字架是很重要的古物  它是博物館的財產
That cross is an important artifact. It belongs in a museum.

28
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,450
跑回去  找到其他人
Run back and find the others.

29
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,990
告訴海拉克先生  有人在洞穴堸蔽F西
Tell Mr. Havelock that there are men looting in the caves.

30
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,240
請他去通知警長  蛇沒什麼好怕的
Have him bring the sheriff. It's only a snake.

31
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,830
聽到了沒？
Did you hear what I said?

32
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,410
很好  跑回去
Right. Run back...

33
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,670
找海拉克先生  請他通知警長
Mr. Havelock... The sheriff...

34
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,750
你打算怎麼辦？
What, what are you gonna do?

35
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,300
不知道
I don't know.

36
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,920
我會想出辦法來的
I'll think of something.

37
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,890
快點把東西挖出來  別聊天了
Dig with your hands, not with your mouth.

38
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,400
他拿走了我們的東西
He's got our thing!

39
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,200
- 抓住他   - 別擋道
- Get him!    - Get off me!

40
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,870
海拉克先生  快來人
Mr. Havelock! Anybody!

41
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,250
他們丟下我逃跑了
Everybody's lost but me.

42
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,880
他在那  快一點
There he is! Let's go! Let's go!

43
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,560
- 別跑  - 我們一定會抓到你

快點  抓住他
Come on! Get him!

46
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,550
快回來
Hey, come back here!

47
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,120
唐恩與多菲馬戲團

48
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,360
全世界最高的長頸鹿

49
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,200
蛇窩

50
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,500
閃開  讓我來吧
Here, let me.

51
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,120
我的天啊
Holy smokes!

52
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,350
放棄吧  孩子
Come on, kid.

53
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,820
你是插翅難飛了
There's no way out of this.

54
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,910
嘿
Hey!

55
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,020
快把鞭子丟上來
Toss up the whip.

56
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,610
你拿到了 小鬼  那是我的東西
You got heart, kid, but that belongs to me.

57
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,110
那是科羅芮多的東西
It belongs to Coronado.

58
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,530
他跟他的子孫們都死了
Coronado is dead, and so are all of his grandchildren.

59
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,040
它應該被送進博物館
This should be in a museum.

60
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,790
快還給我
Now give it back!

61
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,790
是蛇
A snake! Snake!

62
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,130
別讓他逃了
Don't let him get away!

63
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,460
魔術小屋？
Magic?

64
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,590
且慢
Hold it.

65
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,470
別又讓他溜掉了
Make sure he doesn't double back.

66
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,650
小鬼  快出來
Okay, kid, out of the box, now.

67
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,370
混蛋
Son of a...

68
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,170
該死
Damn.

69
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,940
爸
Dad!

70
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,730
爸
Dad.

71
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,320
- 爸  - 出去
- Dad...    - Out.

72
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,860
- 這件事很重要   - 等一下  你先數到二十
- It's important.     - Then wait. Count to 20.

73
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,450
- 不  聽我說  - 二世
- No, Dad. You listen to me.   - Junior!

74
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:19,860
一  二  三  四...
One, two, three, four...

75
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,740
用希臘文數
In Greek.

76
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:39,770
願萬能的上帝能啟發我的心靈
"May he who illuminated this, illuminate me."

77
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,530
我把警長帶來了
I brought the sheriff.

78
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,140
我正好要找他
Just the man I want to see.

79
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,400
有五到六個人...
Now, there were five or six of them...

80
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,980
- 好了  孩子  - 他們在追我...
- It's all right, son.     - They came after me...

81
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,440
- 東西還在你身上嗎？ - 還在
- You still got it?     - Well, yes, sir.

82
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,730
就在這
It's right here.

83
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,110
這下我就安心了
I'm glad to see that

84
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,180
只要你願意物歸原主  原來的物主就不會告你
because the rightful owner of this cross won't press charges if you give it back.

85
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,830
他有五到六個目擊證人
He's got witnesses, five or six of them.

86
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,090
耶
Yeah!

87
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,730
再見
Good day.

88
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,240
今天你輸了  孩子
You lost today, kid,

89
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,200
但這不代表你得心甘情願地接受事實
but it doesn't mean you have to like it.

90
00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:00,650
1938年  葡萄牙海岸

91
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,730
世界還真小  瓊斯博士
Small world, Dr. Jones.

92
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,900
我們又見面了
Too small for two of us.

93
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,000
我以前就曾從你手上拿回屬於我的東西
This is the second time I've had to reclaim my property from you.

94
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:29,860
那應該被送進博物館
That belongs in a museum.

95
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,620
你也一樣
So do you.

96
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,210
把他丟下去
Throw him over the side.

97
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,250
抓住他  他要逃跑了
Grab him, he's getting away! Stop him!

98
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,620
科羅芮多號

99
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:22,360
考古學要尋找的是事實
Archeology is the search for fact...

100
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,570
而非真相
...not truth.

101
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:27,990
如果你們想要尋找真相
If it's truth you're interested in,

102
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:31,610
哲學課教室在走廊底下
Dr. Tyree's philosophy class is right down the hall.

103
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,450
別夢想著要尋找失落的城市  到世界各地旅行
So forget any ideas you've got about lost cities, exotic travel,

104
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,950
挖掘古物
and digging up the world.

105
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,870
我們不會照地圖找寶藏
We do not follow maps to buried treasure,

106
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,600
打了"X"的地方不會有實物
and "X" never, ever, marks the spot.

107
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:49,130
七成的考古學研究  都是在圖書館塈髡
Seventy percent of all archeology is done in the library.

108
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,510
研究  找資料...
Research. Reading.

109
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,640
我們不能片面地看待神話
We cannot afford to take mythology at face value.

110
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,140
下星期要上埃及古物學
Next week, Egyptology,

111
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:04,060
和1885年諾克拉提斯大撤離
starting with the excavation of Naukratis by Flinders Petrie in 1885.

112
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:09,160
有問題的話  你們可以到辦公室來找我
I will be in my office if anybody's got any problems, for the next hour and a half.

113
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,700
馬庫斯  我成功了
Marcus, I did it.

114
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,660
你真的拿到手了
You've got it!

115
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,430
你知道我找它找了多久嗎？
You know how long I've been looking for that?

116
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,010
你花了一輩子的時間
All your life.

117
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,390
一點都沒錯
All my life.

118
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:37,180
這真的是太棒了
Well done, Indy. Very well done, indeed.

119
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,350
它將會成為西班牙專區的收集品之一
This will find a place of honor in our Spanish collection.

120
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,360
我們可以邊吃晚餐邊喝香檳  好好討論我的酬勞
We can discuss my honorarium over dinner and champagne tonight.

121
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,480
- 你請客  - 好吧
- Your treat.    - Yes.

122
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,030
我請客
My treat.

123
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:55,200

信件全放在你的桌上  這是你的電話留言
Your mail is on your desk. Here are your phone messages.

126
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,960
瓊斯博士  你答應過...
Dr. Jones, you promised...

127
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,130
這是你的日程表
This is your appointment schedule,

128
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,550
這些考卷還沒有改好
and these term papers still haven't been graded.

129
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:14,200
愛琳  把每個人的名字登記下來...
Okay. Irene, put everybody's name on a list, get the order they arrived...

130
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,090
- 拜託  瓊斯博士  - 瓊斯博士
- Oh, come on, Dr. Jones.     - Dr. Jones.

...and I'll see each and every one of them in turn.

132
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,990
"意大利威尼斯"
"Venice, Italy."

133
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,030
瓊斯博士
Dr. Jones!

134
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,690
瓊斯博士
Dr. Jones?

135
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:11,980
瓊斯博士
Dr. Jones.

136
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,250
我想這一路你應該還蠻舒服的  瓊斯博士
I trust your trip down was comfortable, Dr. Jones.

137
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,510
希望我的手下沒嚇到你
My men didn't alarm you, I hope.

138
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,680
我是華特•陶諾文
My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.

139
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,470
我認識你
I know who you are, Mr. Donovan.

140
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:42,610
你對博物館貢獻良多
Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous.

141
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,890
你的收藏品令人留下深刻印象
Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.

142
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,980
我跟你一樣非常喜歡古文物
Well, like yourself, Dr. Jones, I have a passion for antiquities.

143
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,150
請過來這邊看看
Have a look over here.

144
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,980
你可能會有興趣
This might interest you.

145
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,990
這是砂岩板  基督教的聖物
Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol.

146
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,410
內容以古希臘文寫成
Early Latin text.

147
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,750
是十二世紀中期古物
Mid-12th century, I should think.

148
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,660
我們也那麼認為
That was our assessment, as well.

149
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,830
你在哪塈鋮鴠扛滿H
Where did this come from?

150
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,880
我的工程師在安卡拉北部挖銅時
My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara

151
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,170
意外地發現了它
while excavating for copper.

152
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,760
你能翻譯出銘文的內容嗎？
Can you translate the inscription?

153
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,560
上帝說  "喝下這水的人 我會賜福給他"
"...who drinks the water I shall give him, says the Lord,

154
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,600
"讓他擁有源源不絕的力量"
"will have a spring inside him

155
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,160
"獲得長生不死的恩惠"
"welling up for eternal life."

156
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,530
"讓它們帶我走向你居住的聖山"
"Let them bring me to your holy mountain in the place where you dwell."

157
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:38,930
"越過沙漠  爬過高山"
"Across the desert and through the mountain

158
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:42,730
"進入新月峽谷"
"to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon,

159
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,580
"進入安放聖盃的神殿"
"to the temple where the cup that...

160
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:53,680
"裝了耶穌基督之血的聖盃 將永遠地安放於此"
"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever."

161
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,260
它指的是聖盃  瓊斯博士
The Holy Grail, Dr. Jones.

162
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:02,300
耶穌在最後的晚餐中用過的杯子
The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper.

163
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,640
當耶穌被釘上十字架時  它被拿來接住耶穌的血
The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion

164
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,240
之後交由亞利馬太的約瑟保管
and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathea.

165
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,480
還扯上了亞瑟王的故事
The Arthur legend.

166
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,980
我聽過這些童話故事
I've heard this bedtime story before.

167
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,860
用聖盃來喝東西
Eternal life, Dr. Jones!

168
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,690
便可以獲得長生不老的力量
The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.

169
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,150
我很喜歡這種童話故事
Now, that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to.

170
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,490
它也是一個老人的夢想
An old man's dream.

171
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:26,030
更是每一個人的希望  我相信這也包括了你父親在內
Every man's dream, including your father's, I believe.

172
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,170
研究聖盃是他的嗜好
Grail lore is his hobby.

173
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,830
他是中世紀文學教師
He's a teacher of medieval literature.

174
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,750
但學生們都討厭他
The one the students hope they don't get.

175
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,210
你冷落了客人們
Walter, you're neglecting your guests.

176
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,420
我馬上來  親愛的
Be along in a moment, dear.

177
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,720
這真的很難抵抗吧？
Hard to resist, isn't it?

178
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:52,390
它詳細記載了聖盃的最後落腳處
The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail.

179
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,310
它根本就沒有用
What good is it?

180
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,190
石碑提到了沙漠  高山和峽谷
This Grail tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons.

181
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,690
範圍太模糊了
It's pretty vague.

182
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,400
你打算從哪媔}始找？
Where do you want to start looking?

183
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:03,820
只可惜石碑破了
Maybe if the tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on,

184
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,530
上半部整個都不見了
but the entire top portion is missing.

185
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,950
但我們還是可以展開行動  尋找聖盃的下落
Just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway.

186
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,920
我要再告訴你一個故事
Let me tell you another bedtime story, Dr. Jones.

187
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:18,040
聖盃交給約瑟保管後
After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathea,

188
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:21,010
一千年來始終找不到它的下落
it disappeared, and was lost for a thousand years

189
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:24,840
最後在第一次十字軍東征中 有三個騎士發現了聖盃的下落
before it was found again by three knights of the First Crusade.

190
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,390
確切地說  是三兄弟
Three brothers, to be exact.

191
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,470
我也聽過這個故事
I've heard this one, as well.

192
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,600
一百五十年後
Two of these brothers walked out of the desert

193
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,730
三兄弟之中的兩個人走出沙漠
150 years after having found the Grail

194
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,850
他們打算回到法國
and began the long journey back to France,

195
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,980
但只有一個人撐了下來
but only one of them made it.

196
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,440
當時已經垂垂老矣的他在臨終前說出了聖盃的下落
And before dying of extreme old age,

197
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:46,160
傳說他把自己的故事告訴了聖方濟會的修士
he supposedly imparted his tale to a... to a Franciscan friar, I think.

198
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,990
那不是傳說  瓊斯博士
Not "supposedly," Dr. Jones.

199
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:54,120
在這份文稿中  修士記載了騎士的故事
This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the knight's story.

200
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,170
雖然沒有明白指出聖盃的下落
It doesn't reveal the location of the Grail, I'm afraid,

201
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,040
但騎士保證這兩條線索
but the knight promised that two markers

202
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:00,670
能告訴我們它在哪
that had been left behind would.

203
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:04,380
這個石碑就是線索之一
This tablet is one of those markers.

204
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,680
它證明了騎士的故事是真的
It proves the knight's story is true.

205
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,350
可惜石碑破了
But as you pointed out, it's incomplete.

206
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,390
第二條線索 在他死去兄弟的墳墓中
Now, the second marker is entombed with the knight's dead brother.

207
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:18,850
聖盃計劃的負責人相信  這座墳墓就在意大利威尼斯
Our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice, Italy.

208
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,780
你應該可以瞭解
As you can now see, Dr. Jones,

209
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,860
我們即將完成這個偉大使命
we're about to complete a great quest

210
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:28,990
這場尋找之旅有近兩千年的歷史
that began almost 2,000 years ago.

211
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,450
現在我們差一步就能成功
We're only one step away.

212
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,700
那也是最常嘗到失敗滋味的時候
That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.

213
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,420
你說的沒錯
You could be more right than you know.

214
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:38,790
是嗎？
Yes?

215
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,710
我們遇到了大麻煩
We've hit a snag.

216
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:46,560
這項計劃的負責人突然失蹤  他的研究成果也消失不見
Our project leader has vanished, along with all his research.

217
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,340
他的同事史奈德博士
We received a cable from his colleague, Dr. Schneider,

218
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:53,140
不知道他的下落
who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him.

219
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,890
我要你接替他的任務
I want you to pick up the trail where he left off.

220
00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:00,060
只要能找到他  就能找到聖盃
Find the man, and you will find the Grail.

221
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:04,400
你找錯人了  陶諾文先生
You've got the wrong Jones, Mr. Donovan.

222
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,200
你為什麼不去找我老爸呢？
Why don't you try my father?

223
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,070
我們已經找過他了
We already have.

224
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,120
你父親就是那位失蹤的負責人
Your father is the man who has disappeared.

225
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,010
你父親跟我是多年好友
Your father and I have been friends since time began.

226
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,300
我是看著你長大的
I've watched you grow up, Indy.

227
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,090
也是看著你們倆分開的
I've watched the two of you grow apart.

228
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,180
我從來沒看過你這麼擔心他
I've never seen you this concerned about him before.

229
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,390
老爸？
Dad?

230
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,600
他是個學者  不是個冒險家
He's an academic, a bookworm. He's not a field man.

231
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,440
爸？
Dad?

232
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,190
我的老天爺
Dear God.

233
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:46,920
那個老笨蛋  幫自己惹上了什麼樣的麻煩
What has the old fool got himself into now?

234
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,410
我不知道  不管發生了什麼事 他一定是瘋了
I don't know, but whatever it is, he's in over his head.

235
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,160
老爸？
Dad?

236
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,490
這是今天收到的信件  信被拆開過了
It's today's mail, and it's been opened.

237
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,160
信件...
Mail.

238
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,460
就是這個  馬庫斯
That's it, Marcus.

239
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,420
"意大利威尼斯"
Venice, Italy.

240
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,130
那是什麼東西？
What is it?

241
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,310
我老爸的聖盃日記
It's Dad's Grail diary.

242
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,310
記載著他找到的每一條線索和他所有的發現
Every clue he followed. Every discovery he made.

243
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:23,500
完整地記錄了他尋找聖盃的經過
A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail.

244
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:26,570
這是他一生的心血
This is his whole life.

245
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,650
他為什麼要把它寄給我？
Why would he have sent this to me?

246
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,150
我不知道
I don't know,

247
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,870
但一定有人在覬覦這本日記
but someone must want it pretty badly.

248
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,920
你相信嗎 馬庫斯？
Do you believe, Marcus?

249
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,810
你相信聖盃真的存在嗎？
Do you believe the Grail actually exists?

250
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:06,770
事實上尋找聖盃就是在尋找人類的神性
The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.

251
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,860
如果你要的是事實  我沒辦法告訴你答案
But if you want facts, Indy, I've none to give you.

252
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:14,450
我已經一把年紀了  我打算相信上帝真的存在
At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith.

253
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:21,540
打電話通知陶諾文
Call Donovan, Marcus.

254
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,540
我會立刻搭飛機到威尼斯
Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.

255
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:28,910
我會告訴他我們需要兩張機票
I'll tell him we'll take two.

256
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,970
我們到了威尼斯後呢？
All right, tell me what's going to happen when we get to Venice.

257
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:38,010
史奈德博士會去接你們
Don't worry, Dr. Schneider will be there to meet you.

258
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,640
- 史奈德？ - 你們可以住在我在威尼斯的公寓
- Schneider?    - I maintain an apartment in Venice. It's at your disposal.

259
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,640
很好  謝謝
Oh, well, that's good. Thank you.

260
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:47,560
瓊斯博士  祝你好運
Dr. Jones, good luck.

261
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,900
小心點  別相信任何人
Now be very careful. Don't trust anybody.

262
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:56,400
紐約

263
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:02,720
紐芬蘭

264
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:16,290
亞速群島

265
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:19,410
里斯本

266
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:24,590
威尼斯

267
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:37,450
- 這就是威尼斯  - 沒錯
- Ah, Venice...   - Yes.

268
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:41,620
哪一位是史奈德博士？
How will we recognize this Dr. Schneider when we see him?

269
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,750
我不知道  或許他會認得我們
I don't know. Maybe he'll know us.

270
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,660
你是瓊斯博士嗎？
Dr. Jones?

271
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,960
是的
Yes?

272
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:51,290
我就知道是你
I knew it was you.

273
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,130
你有著你父親的眼睛
You have your father's eyes.

274
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,930
我還有我媽媽的耳朵  至於其他的都是你的了
And my mother's ears, but the rest belongs to you.

275
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:03,280
但最棒的都被別人拿走了
Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.

276
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,680
- 你就是馬庫斯•布魯迪？ - 沒錯
- Marcus Brody?     - That's right.

277
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,520
我是艾兒莎•史奈德博士
Dr. Elsa Schneider.

278
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,770
你好嗎？
How do you do?

279
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:12,650
我最後一次見到你父親  是在圖書館
The last time I saw your father, we were in the library.

280
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:15,240
他就快要找到墳墓了
He was very close to tracking down the knight's tomb.

281
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,200
我從來沒見過他如此興奮
I've never seen him so excited.

282
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,610
他跟小學生一樣笑個不停
He was as giddy as a schoolboy.

283
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,700
你說那個鐵血教授？
Who? Attila the Professor?

284
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,950
他從來不會笑個不停  即使他真的只是個小學生
He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy.

285
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,660
美麗的小姐  請收下吧
Freulein, will you permit me?

286
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:29,750
- 通常我是不會答應的  - 通常我也不會這麼做
- I usually don't.     - I usually don't, either.

287
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:32,250
- 那麼我就收下了  - 這會令我高興的
- In that case, I permit you.    - It would make me very happy.

288
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,670
我已經開始傷心了  到了明天  它就會凋謝
But I'm already sad. By tomorrow, it will have faded.

289
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,760
明天我再送你一個
Tomorrow I'll steal you another.

290
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,170
我不想打斷你們  但是...
I hate to interrupt you, but the reason we're here...

291
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,220
有樣東西我希望你能看一下
Yes. I have something to show you.

292
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,100
我留你父親自己在圖書館工作
I left your father working in the library.

293
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:45,270
當時他請我去拿舊都市計劃圖
He sent me to the map section to fetch an ancient plan of the city.

294
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:48,180
我回來時發現他跟文件不見了
When I got back to his table, he'd gone, with all his papers,

295
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:50,770
只剩下這張紙  在他的椅子旁邊發現的
except for that scrap, which I found near his chair.

296
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,350
是羅馬數字
Roman numerals.

297
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,230
圖書館到了
Here is the library.

298
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:57,240
它看起來一點都不像圖書館
That doesn't look much like a library.

299
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,450
比較像是教堂
Looks like a converted church.

300
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:01,610
一點都沒錯
In this case, it's the literal truth.

301
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,450
你們來到了聖地
We are on holy ground.

302
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:07,160
這些柱子飽受戰火蹂躪  之後被送來這
These columns over here were brought back as spoils of war

303
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,540
在十字軍東征時 拜占庭帝國飽受戰爭之苦
after the sacking of Byzantium during the Crusades.

304
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,500
抱歉
Now, please excuse me.

305
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,300
圖書館快關門了
The library's closing in a few moments.

306
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:18,340
我會去安排讓我們再待一會
I'll arrange for us to stay a little longer.

307
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:24,550
馬庫斯  我看過這扇窗戶
Marcus, I've seen this window before.

308
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,640
在哪堙H
Where?

309
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,890
就在老爸的日記
Right here, in Dad's diary.

310
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,650
看到了沒？
You see?

311
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,530
你看  印第  是羅馬數字
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals.

312
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,280
老爸真的找到了線索
Dad was onto something here.

313
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:47,300
但我們不知它們代表什麼意思
Well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still don't know what they mean.

314
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,830
他會把日記寄給我是有原因的
Dad sent me this diary for a reason.

315
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:51,620
這件事千萬別說出去
Until we find out why, I suggest we keep it to ourselves.

316
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:52,920
有發現嗎？
Find something?

317
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
三  七跟十
Yes. Three, seven and ten.

318
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,590
窗戶上的數字
That window seems to be the source of the Roman numerals.

319
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:59,260
我真的太粗心了
My God, I must be blind.

320
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:02,510
他要找的並不是記載墳墓的書
Dad wasn't looking for a book about the knight's tomb,

321
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,550
而是墳墓本身
he was looking for the tomb itself.

322
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,970
你找到了嗎？
Don't you get it?

323
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,010
墳墓就在圖書館
The tomb is somewhere in the library.

324
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,020
你說過這堨H前是教堂
You said yourself it used to be a church.

325
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,230
你看
Look.

326
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,190
三
Three.

327
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,730
七...
Seven.

328
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,360
七  十
Seven. Ten.

329
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,280
十
And ten.

330
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,160
十在哪堙H
Now where's the ten?

331
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,780
找一找十在哪
Look around for the ten.

332
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,590
三跟七...
Three and seven.

333
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,760
七跟七...
Seven and seven

334
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:42,800
十
and ten.

335
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:04,890
十
Ten.

336
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,920
"X"就是墳墓的地點
"X" marks the spot.

337
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,050
找到了
Bingo.

338
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:08,720
你真的很行  瓊斯博士
You don't disappoint, Dr. Jones.

339
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,340
你就跟你父親一樣
You're a great deal like your father.

340
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,970
但他失蹤了  我還在
Except he's lost, and I'm not.

341
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,560
快來幫幫我
Lower me down.

342
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:26,030
幫我看好它
Look after this for me, will you?

343
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,080
快一點
Come on.

344
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,590
四或五世紀的異教徒符號
Pagan symbols. Fourth or fifth century.

345
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,760
沒錯
Right.

346
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:55,310
年代是十字軍東征前六百年
600 years before the Crusades.

347
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,890
幾個世紀後
The Christians would have dug their own passages

348
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:00,190
基督徒挖掘了屬於他們的通道
and burial chambers centuries later.

349
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,230
沒錯
That's right.

350
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:03,860
如果第一次十字軍東征騎士真的埋在這
If there's a knight of the First Crusade down here,

351
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,840
他一定在那邊
that's where we'll find him.

352
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,390
這是什麼東西？
What's this one?

353
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,940
約櫃
The Ark of the Covenant.

354
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,100
- 你確定？ - 非常確定
- Are you sure?    - Pretty sure.

355
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,160
小心
Watch out.

356
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,760
是石油
It's petroleum.

357
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:21,680
我該退休到這堥茷鶞o井
I should sink a well down here and retire.

358
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:40,040
把打火機拿過來
Give me the lighter.

359
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,880
是老鼠
Oh, rats.

360
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,570
快來吧
Come on.

361
00:33:58,450 --> 00:33:59,870
這邊
Come here.

362
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,920
你看  他一定在這些棺木之中
Look, it... it must be one of these.

363
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:15,130
你看看  這些雕刻跟銘文有多漂亮
Look at the artistry of these carvings, and the scrollwork.

364
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,110
就是這具棺木
It's this one.

365
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:51,250
沒錯  我們找到它了
This is it. We found it.

366
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,010
你看
Look.

367
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:01,510
盾牌上的銘文跟聖盃石碑的銘文是一樣的
The engraving on the shield, it's the same as on the Grail tablet.

368
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:05,350
這面盾牌是第二條線索
The shield is the second marker.

369
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,140
那是什麼？
What's that?

370
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:10,270
這是我爸從聖盃石碑上拓印下來的
It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail tablet.

371
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:15,270
你就像你父親一樣  興奮地笑個不停
Just like your father, giddy as a schoolboy.

372
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:18,940
如果他能親自到這堥  那就真的是太棒了
Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?

373
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:23,200
他沒辦法過老鼠那一關
He never would have made it past the rats.

374
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,400
他最害怕的東西就是老鼠
He hates rats. He's scared to death of them.

375
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:50,310
快退回牆邊
Get back! Back against the wall.

376
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:57,150
快趴下  吸氣
Quick! Under it! Air pocket!

377
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,280
- 別走開  - 什麼？
- Don't wander off.   - What?

378
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,780
什麼？
What?

379
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,850
我找到出路了
I think I've found a way out.

380
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:29,310
深呼吸
Deep breath.

381
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,580
這就是威尼斯
Ah, Venice.

382
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,690
你瘋了嗎？別從中間穿過去
Are you crazy? Don't go between them!

383
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:59,190
從中間穿過去？你瘋了嗎？
Go between them? Are you crazy?

384
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:12,200
我叫你繞過去
I said go around!

385
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:14,330
你叫我從中間穿過去
You said go between them!

386
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:17,040
我叫你別從中間穿過去
I said, don't go between them!

387
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:20,440
不
No!

388
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,440
你為什麼要殺我們？
Why are you trying to kill us?

389
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:29,800
因為你們要找聖盃
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.

390
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:33,120
你也殺了我父親嗎？
My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?

391
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,200
沒有
No.

392
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,120
他在哪堙H
Where is he?

393
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,250
快說  不然你就死定了
Talk or you're dead.

394
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:39,960
該死  快告訴我
Damn it, tell me!

395
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,790
告訴我
Tell me!

396
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,420
你不放手的話  我們都會死
If you don't let go, Dr. Jones, we'll both die.

397
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,000
那我們就一起死吧
Then we'll die.

398
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:49,520
我已經準備好受死了  你呢？
My soul is prepared. How's yours?

399
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,220
這是你的最後機會
This is your last chance.

400
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:55,150
不  這是你的最後機會
No, Dr. Jones, it's yours.

401
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:13,610
好吧  我父親在哪堙H
All right, where's my father?

402
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,530
放了我  我就告訴你
If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.

403
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,490
你是誰？
Who are you?

404
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,500
我叫做卡辛姆
My name is Kazim.

405
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,080
你為什麼要殺我？
And why were you trying to kill me?

406
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:26,840
一千年來 沒有人知道聖盃的秘密
The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years,

407
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:28,920
在這段時間
and for all that time,

408
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,960
十字劍兄弟會
the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword

409
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:34,960
不計任何代價保護這個秘密
have been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.

410
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:39,450
讓我下船
Let me off at this jetty.

411
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:46,860
捫心自問一下  為什麼你要尋找聖盃？
Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ?

412
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:51,000
你要追求上帝的光榮  還是自己的光榮呢？
Is it for His glory, or for yours?

413
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:54,530
我要找的不是聖盃  我是來找我的父親
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.

414
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:58,780
既然如此  上帝會與你同在
In that case, God be with you in your quest.

415
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:03,400
他就在德奧邊境的布藍瓦德城堡
Your father is being held in the Castle of Brunwald, on the Austrian-German border.

416
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,510
你的頭還會痛嗎？
How's the head?

417
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:16,010
好多了  我已經看過了
It's better, now I've seen this.

418
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:20,880
它是一座城市的名字 "亞力山勒達"
It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta"?

419
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:28,600
第一次十字軍東征的騎士們圍攻亞力山勒達
The knights of the First Crusade laid siege to the city of Alexandretta for over a year.

420
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:30,900
整個城市被破壞殆盡
The entire city was destroyed.

421
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:37,240
現在的伊斯肯德隆就蓋在該城的遺跡上
The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins.

422
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,580
還記得聖盃石碑上是怎麼寫的嗎？
Marcus, you remember what the Grail tablet said,

423
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,330
"越過沙漠  爬過高山"
"Across the desert and through the mountain

424
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:46,000
"進入新月峽谷"
"to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."

425
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:50,670
到底是哪堙H
But where exactly?

426
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,630
你父親一定知道
Your father would know.

427
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:57,550
你父親真的知道  你看  他還畫了一幅地圖
Your father did know. Look. He made a map.

428
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:02,500
他將尋找聖盃的線索拼湊在一起
He must have pieced it together from clues scattered through the whole history of the Grail quest.

429
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,560
一張無地名地圖
A map with no names.

430
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:07,440
東面有綠洲的城市  就在這
Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east, here.

431
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,360
他知道得由南面進入山區
He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river,

432
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,700
直闖峽谷區
and the river led into the mountains, here. Straight to the canyon.

433
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:18,620
除了該由哪個城市出發外  他什麼都知道
He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.

434
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:21,370
亞力山勒達
Alexandretta.

435
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:24,040
- 我們知道了  - 沒錯  現在我們知道了
- Now we know.    - Yes. Now we know.

436
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,710
請薩拉到伊斯肯德隆跟你會合
Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.

437
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:28,290
你要去哪堙H
What about you?

438
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:29,420
我要去找我爸
I'm going after Dad.

439
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,520
艾兒莎
Elsa?

440
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:00,160
艾兒莎
Elsa? Elsa?

441
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:13,960
- 我的房間  - 我的也差不多
- My room...   - Mine, too.

442
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,340
他們在找什麼？
What were they looking for?

443
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:17,510
就是這個
This.

444
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,510
聖盃日記
The Grail diary?

445
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:22,510
它在你手上？
You had it?

446
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:25,140
你不相信我？
You didn't trust me.

447
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,890
之前我不瞭解你
I didn't know you.

448
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:29,480
至少我讓你跟著我們跑
At least I let you tag along.

449
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:30,770
對
Oh, yes.

450
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:33,770
只要送花給女人  她們就會跟著你跑
Give them a flower, and they'll follow you anywhere.

451
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,610
別這樣  你一點都不生氣
Knock it off. You're not mad.

452
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:39,190
真的嗎？
No?

453
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,910
當然  你喜歡我的行事作風
No. You like the way I do things.

454
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:43,950
還好我的行事作風跟你不一樣
It's lucky I don't do things the same way.

455
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:46,830
不然你現在還在威尼斯碼頭上
You'd still be standing at the Venice pier!

456
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,120
發生了什麼事？
Look, what do you think is going on here?

457
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,670
我幾乎被燒死跟溺死
Since I met you, I've nearly been incinerated,

458
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:55,210
還差點被切成碎片當魚飼料
drowned, shot at, and chopped into fish bait.

459
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,800
我們被拖進一個邪惡計劃中
We're caught in the middle of something sinister here.

460
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,840
老爸有了重大的發現
My guess is Dad found out more than he was looking for.

461
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,220
還沒有找到他之前
And until I'm sure, I'm going to continue to do things

462
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,890
我會用我的方法來做事
the way I think they should be done.

463
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:10,890
你膽子真大 竟敢吻我
How dare you kiss me!

464
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:20,320
放開我  我不喜歡主動的女人
Leave me alone. I don't like fast women.

465
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:24,490
我討厭自大的男人
And I hate arrogant men.

466
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,500
我愛威尼斯
Ah, Venice.

467
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,200
威尼斯

468
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,610
薩爾茨堡

469
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:10,490
你對這個地方瞭解多少？
What do you know about this place?

470
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:13,660
布藍瓦德家族是藝術收藏家
I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.

471
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:17,750
你打算怎麼辦？
What are you going to do?

472
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,300
不知道  我會想出辦法來
Don't know. I'll think of something.

473
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:29,010
什麼事？
Yes?

474
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,890
你的動作真慢
And not before time!

475
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:33,430
你打算讓我們站在門口嗎？
Did you intend to leave us standing on the doorstep all day?

476
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,060
我們全身都濕了
We're drenched!

477
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,900
我一定會感冒鼻塞的
Now look, I've gone and caught a sniffle.

478
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:40,230
你們有預約嗎？
Are you expected?

479
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,070
別用那種語氣跟我說話
Do not take that tone with me, my good man.

480
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:44,990
快通知男爵
Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald

481
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:48,660
克拉倫斯•麥當納爵爺跟助手
that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant

482
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:51,080
來看繡帷了
are here to view the tapestries.

483
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,330
看繡帷？
Tapestries?

484
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:53,910
這傢伙蠢呆了
Dear me, the man is dense.

485
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,290
這是一座城堡  對吧？這埵麻萵c嗎？
This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?

486
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,710
這的確是一座城堡
This is a castle,

487
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:02,340
我們有很多繡帷
and we have many tapestries.

488
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:07,130
如果你是蘇格蘭爵爺  我就是米老鼠
But if you are a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse!

489
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:09,810
他真是大膽
How dare he?

490
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:39,120
是納粹  我討厭這些傢伙
Nazis. I hate these guys.

491
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,220
我想他就在這
This one. I think he's in here.

492
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:55,970
你怎麼知道？
How do you know?

493
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:57,810
因為這媥D到嚴密監控
Because it's wired.

494
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,090
印第
Indy? Indy?

495
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:30,590
別擔心  小事一件
Don't worry. This is kid's play.

496
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,470
我馬上回來
I'll be right back.

497
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,290
二世
Junior?

498
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:00,660
是我  爸爸
Yes, sir.

499
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,710
你真的來了  二世
It is you, Junior!

500
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:05,210
請別叫我那個名字
Don't call me that, please.

501
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:06,630
你來這堸竣偵礡H
Well, what are you doing here?

502
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,510
我是來救你的
I came to get you. What do you thi...

503
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:21,310
十四世紀末期明朝瓷器
Late 14th century, Ming dynasty.

504
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:23,940
這真是令人傷心
It breaks the heart.

505
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:26,360
我的頭好痛  你竟然打我
And the head. You hit me, Dad.

506
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,480
我永遠都不會原諒自己
I'll never forgive myself.

507
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:30,900
別擔心  我沒事
Don't worry, I'm fine.

508
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:34,160
謝天謝地
Thank God.

509
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:38,620
它是假貨
It's fake.

510
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:43,040
從黏合的地方就可以看出來
See, you can tell by the cross section.

511
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,000
不
No!

512
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:48,630
我們得離開這
Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.

513
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:52,800
對不起  我打傷了你的頭 我還以為你是納粹
Well, I'm sorry about your head, though, but I thought you were one of them.

514
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,510
爸  他們會從大門進來
Dad, they come in through the doors.

515
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:57,430
說的好
Good point.

516
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,850
但流汗總比流血好
But better safe than sorry.

517
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:01,930
這一次我錯了
So I was wrong this time.

518
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:05,480
但把日記寄給你是正確的選擇
But, by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my diary.

519
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:06,690
很明顯  你拿到了日記
You obviously got it.

520
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:11,480
我拿到了日記並好好地利用它
I got it, and I used it.

521
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,650
我們找到了地下墓穴的入口
We found the entrance to the catacombs.

522
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:16,240
就在圖書館媔隉H
Through the library?

523
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:18,070
沒錯
Right.

524
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:22,870
我就知道
I knew it.

525
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:24,870
理查爵士的墳墓呢？
And the tomb of Sir Richard?

526
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:27,790
我找到了
Found it.

527
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,170
他真的埋在那堙H
He was actually there?

528
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,340
你看到了他？
You saw him?

529
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:37,550
我只看到他的遺骨
Well, what was left of him.

530
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:39,600
他的盾牌呢？
And his shield,

531
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:43,990
理查爵士盾牌上的銘文呢？
the inscription on Sir Richard's shield?

532
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,770
亞力山勒達
"Alexandretta."

533
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:48,730
亞力山勒達  那是當然的
Alexandretta! Of course!

534
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:52,900
它就位於東土耳其帝國的朝聖路線上
On the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire.

535
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:57,660
二世  你真的辦到了
Junior, you did it.

536
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:01,700
不  爸  你花了四十年的時間終於辦到了
No, Dad. You did. Forty years.

537
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:05,290
真希望我能跟你一起去
If only I could have been with you.

538
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:07,170
那埵釩雃h老鼠  爸
There were rats, Dad.

539
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:08,960
有老鼠？
Rats?

540
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,460
對  又大又肥的老鼠
Yeah, big ones.

541
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:12,170
納粹為什麼要抓你？
What do the Nazis want with you, Dad?

542
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:14,760
- 他們想要我的日記  - 什麼？
- They wanted my diary.  - Yeah?

543
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:19,390
我得盡可能讓那本日記離開我身邊
I knew I had to get that book as far away from me as I possibly could.

544
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:23,390
沒錯
Yeah.

545
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:29,560
瓊斯博士
Dr. Jones.

546
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:30,770
什麼事？
Yes?

547
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:35,780
我現在就要那本書
I will take the book now.

548
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:39,240
哪本書？
What book?

549
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:41,740
你口袋堛漕漸誘敿O
You have the diary in your pocket.

550
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,540
你這個笨蛋
You dolt!

551
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:47,330
你以為我兒子會那麼笨
Do you think my son would be that stupid

552
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:50,790
把我的日記帶回來這堙H
that he would bring my diary all the way back here?

553
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,840
你該不會真的那麼做了？
You didn't, did you?

554
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,220
- 你沒把它帶在身上吧？ - 呃...
- You didn't bring it, did you?   - Well...

555
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:59,180
你真的那麼做了
You did.

556
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:01,220
我們能不能待會再談？
Look, can we discuss this later?

557
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,350
我該把它寄給馬克斯兄弟
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.

558
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:04,970
別激動
Will you take it easy?

559
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:06,470
別激動？
Take it easy?

560
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,560
我把它寄回家
Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?

561
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,230
只為了不讓它落入壞人手中
So it wouldn't fall into their hands!

562
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,310
我來這堭洇A
I came here to save you!

563
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,400
真的嗎？
Oh, yeah?

564
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,900
誰有辦法救你呢  二世？
And who's gonna come to save you, Junior?

565
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:17,190
我跟你說過
I told you...

566
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:26,660
別叫我二世
...don't call me Junior!

567
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:31,000
看看你做的好事
Look what you did!

568
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:34,960
我不敢相信你竟然...
I can't believe what you did...

569
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:39,050
艾兒莎
Elsa? Elsa?

570
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:41,300
夠了  快把槍放下
That's far enough. Put down the gun, Dr. Jones.

571
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:43,430
快把槍放下  不然這位小姐死定了
Put down the gun, or the Freulein dies.

572
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:45,810
- 她跟他們是一夥的  - 印第 求你了
- But she's one of them.   - Indy, please!

573
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:47,770
- 她是納粹  - 什麼？
- She's a Nazi.    - What?

574
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:49,100
- 相信我  - 印第  不
- Trust me.   - Indy, no!

575
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:50,190
我會殺了她
I will kill her!

576
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:53,580
- 快動手吧  - 別開槍
- Yeah? Go ahead!  - No! Don't shoot!

577
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:55,790
別擔心  他不會開槍的
Don't worry. He won't.

578
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:57,780
印第  拜託你照他的話去做
Indy, please! Do what he says!

579
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:59,780
別聽她的
And don't listen to her.

580
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:01,610
夠了  她死定了
Enough! She dies!

581
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:03,240
等一下
Wait! Wait...

582
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:12,210
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

583
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:15,540
不  別說抱歉
No, don't be.

584
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,640
你該聽你父親的話
But you should have listened to your father.

585
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:52,660
她把自己的房間弄得亂七八糟  我中了她的詭計
She ransacked her own room, and I fell for it.

586
00:52:54,880 --> 00:53:00,880
你怎麼知道她是納粹？
How did you know she was a Nazi?

587
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:03,010
她睡覺時會說夢話
She talks in her sleep.

588
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:15,550
我不相信她  你為什麼會相信她？
I didn't trust her. Why did you?

589
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:18,730
因為他沒有聽進我的話
Because he didn't take my advice.

590
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:26,740
陶諾文
Donovan.

591
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:30,620
我不是警告過你別相信任何人嗎？
Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody, Dr. Jones?

592
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:33,200
我看錯你了  華特
I misjudged you, Walter.

593
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:36,370
我就知道  你連自己的母親都會出賣
I knew you would sell your mother for an Etruscan vase,

594
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:39,920
但我沒想到你會將祖國跟靈魂
but I didn't know you would sell your country and your soul

595
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,560
出賣給這堆人渣
to the slime of humanity.

596
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,470
史奈德博士
Dr. Schneider,

597
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:48,140
日記埵釵n幾頁被撕掉了
there are pages torn out of this.

598
00:53:56,810 --> 00:54:00,980
這本日記埵酗@張沒有地名的地圖
This book contained a map, a map with no names,

599
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:03,190
以及從不知名的城市
precise directions from the unknown city

600
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,190
進入神秘峽谷的路線
to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.

601
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,280
以前的確是那樣的
So it did.

602
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,110
被撕掉的那幾頁在哪堙H
Where are these missing pages, this map?

603
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:09,570
我們要找回那幾頁
We must have these pages back.

604
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:10,910
你是在白費口舌
You're wasting your breath.

605
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:12,790
他不會說的
He won't tell us,

606
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:14,700
他不必那麼做
and he doesn't have to.

607
00:54:15,370 --> 00:54:18,330
我知道那幾頁在哪
It's perfectly obvious where the pages are.

608
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,840
他把它們交給了馬庫斯•布魯迪
He's given them to Marcus Brody.

609
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:21,960
馬庫斯？
Marcus?

610
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:24,420
你也把他拖來了？
You didn't drag poor Marcus along, did you?

611
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:25,920
他不是個冒險家
He's not up to the challenge.

612
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:27,470
他一定會露出馬腳
He sticks out like a sore thumb.

613
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:28,680
我們會逮到他的
We'll find him.

614
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,430
少做夢了
The hell you will.

615
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:33,700
他已經提前你們兩天出發了
He's got a two-day head start on you, which is more than he needs.

616
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:36,100
到處都有布魯迪的朋友
Brody's got friends in every town and village

617
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:37,270
從這到蘇丹
from here to the Sudan.

618
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:40,020
他精通十幾種語言
He speaks a dozen languages, knows every local custom.

619
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,940
他會隱身人群中消失不見
He'll blend in, disappear.

620
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:43,860
你們再也見不到他
You'll never see him again.

621
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:47,030
如果運氣好的話  他應該已經找到聖盃了
With any luck, he's got the Grail already.

622
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:51,000
有人會說英語或古希臘語嗎？
Does anyone here speak English? Or even ancient Greek?

623
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:52,200
喝水？不用了
Water? No, thank you, sir.

624
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:53,620
魚都在水堸絲R
No. Fish make love in it.

625
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:54,530
伊斯肯德隆

626
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:56,960
謝謝你  我真的不需要
Goodness me. Thank you so much. No, I don't like that.

627
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,210
我真不需要
No, I really don't want...

628
00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:00,460
不  謝謝你
No, no, thank you very much.

629
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:02,540
不用了  我吃素
No, thank you, madam. I'm a vegetarian.

630
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:05,760
有人聽得懂我的話嗎？
Does anyone understand a word I'm saying here?

631
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:07,300
布魯迪先生
Mr. Brody!

632
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:08,550
這真的是太好了
Sallah. What a relief.

633
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:10,970
馬庫斯•布魯迪
Marcus Brody, sir.

634
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:12,760
- 印第人呢？ - 他在奧地利
- But where is Indy?   - He's in Austria.

635
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:14,310
處理一點小事
A slight detour.

636
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:15,430
你一個人嗎？
You are on your own?

637
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,230
對  不要驚慌  一切都在控制中
Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control.

638
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,560
補給品都安排好了嗎？
Have you, have you arranged our supplies?

639
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:22,480
是的  我們到底要去哪堙H
Yes, of course. But where are we going?

640
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,020
跟著這張地圖走就對了
This map will show you.

641
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:26,070
畫出它的人是...
It was drawn by...

642
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:27,990
布魯迪先生
Mr. Brody.

643
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:29,900
歡迎光臨伊斯肯德隆
Welcome to Iskenderun.

644
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:33,200
博物館館長派車來接你
The director of the Museum of Antiquities has sent a car for you.

645
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,580
請吧  先生
Well, your servant, sir.

646
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:36,910
我跟他是一起的
And I am his.

647
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:38,960
請跟我來
Follow me, please.

648
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:41,000
看來我在這堳雃釵W
My reputation precedes me.

649
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,250
本地沒有博物館
There is no museum in Iskenderun.

650
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,710
請把文件拿出來
Papers, please.

651
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:47,170
你要報紙？沒問題
Papers? Of course.

652
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,720
- 快跑  - 是的
- Run.   - Yes.

653
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,550
報紙？應該就在這
Papers. Got it here.

654
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:52,260
我剛剛才看完
Just finished reading it myself.

655
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:54,510
- 快跑  - 是的
- Run.   - Yes.

656
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,510
埃及郵報的早報版  快跑
Egyptian Mail, morning edition. Run.

657
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,810
你剛剛說...
Did you say...

658
00:55:57,930 --> 00:55:59,350
快跑
Run!

659
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,030
快點上來
Okay, okay, quick, quick, quick!

660
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:19,120
從後門出去
Find the back door! Find the back door!

661
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:34,340
這真的是太誇張了
Intolerable.

662
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:40,500
史奈德博士  你得立刻回柏林
Dr. Schneider. Message from Berlin. You must return immediately.

663
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:43,350
- 有一個會議在亞利安文化中心召開  - 那麼？
- A rally at the Institute of Aryan Culture.   - So?

664
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:47,610
高層要求你親臨參加
Your presence on the platform is requested at the highest level.

665
00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:50,690
謝謝  伊斯肯德隆見
Thank you, Herr Oberst. I will meet you at Iskenderun.

666
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:52,700
把日記送到帝國博物館
Take this diary to the Reichmuseum in Berlin.

667
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:55,320
向他們報告我們的進展
It will show them our progress, ahead of schedule.

668
00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:57,830
沒有那張地圖  它根本一點作用都沒有
Without the map, I'm afraid it's no better than a souvenir.

669
00:56:57,910 --> 00:56:59,160
讓我殺了他們
Let me kill them now.

670
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:00,330
不行
No.

671
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:02,250
如果找不到那幾頁日記
If we fail to recover the pages from Brody,

672
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:03,920
我們需要他們的幫助
we'll need them alive.

673
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,500
博士說的話永遠都是對的
Always do what the doctor orders.

674
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:16,440
別那樣子看我
Don't look at me like that.

675
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,510
我們都想找到聖盃
We both wanted the Grail.

676
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,520
我願意不計代價找到它
I would have done anything to get it.

677
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,600
你也一樣
You would have done the same.

678
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,600
我很遺憾你會那麼想
I'm sorry you think so.

679
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:39,410
我不會忘了跟你在一起的歡愉
I can't forget how wonderful it was.

680
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:40,540
謝謝
Thank you.

681
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:42,540
我也覺得很愉快
It was rather wonderful.

682
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:53,550
史奈德博士
Dr. Schneider.

683
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:56,680
車子已經準備好了
Your car is waiting.

684
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:07,490
奧地利人都是這樣說再見的
That's how Austrians say good-bye.

685
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:17,320
德國人是這樣說再見的  瓊斯博士
And this is how we say good-bye in Germany, Dr. Jones.

686
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:27,500
我比較喜歡奧地利人的方式
I liked the Austrian way better.

687
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:29,250
我也一樣
So did I.

688
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:30,920
快把繩子鬆開
Let's try and get these ropes loose.

689
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,840
我們得比納粹更早找到馬庫斯
We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do.

690
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,630
你說過他提早兩天出發  他可以隱身在人潮中
You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear.

691
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:39,180
你在開玩笑嗎？那是我瞎編的
Are you kidding? I made that up.

692
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:42,470
他連在博物館堻ㄦ|迷路
You know Marcus. He got lost once in his own museum.

693
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:48,020
你摸得到我外套的左邊口袋嗎？
Can you try and reach my left jacket pocket?

694
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:49,980
你要我找什麼？
What am I looking for?

695
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:52,020
我的幸運護身符
My lucky charm.

696
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:54,610
我只摸到一個打火機
Feels like a cigarette lighter.

697
00:58:56,110 --> 00:58:57,320
快把繩子燒斷
Try and burn through the ropes.

698
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:00,450
太好了
Very good.

699
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:26,390
我想告訴你一件事
I ought to tell you something.

700
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,560
現在不是感傷的時候  出去再說
Don't get sentimental now, Dad. Save it till we get out of here.

701
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:30,980
地板著火了
The floor's on fire.

702
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:32,650
- 看到了嗎？ - 什麼？
- See?     - What?

703
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:34,610
椅子也著火了
And the chair.

704
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:37,070
快一點
Move! Move it out of here! Go!

705
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:38,950
到桌子旁邊去
It's scorching the table! Fast!

706
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:40,070
- 快一點  - 好
- Move!    - Okay!

707
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:56,840
我們抓到了馬庫斯•布魯迪
Well, we have Marcus Brody,

708
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:59,170
更重要的是  我們找到了地圖
but more important, we have the map.

709
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:05,100
"聽從元帥的命令"
"By the personal command of the Fehrer.

710
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:07,180
"是成功的關鍵要素"
"Secrecy essential to success.

711
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,680
"消滅美國陰謀者"
"Eliminate the American conspirators."

712
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:13,850
德國人已對瓊斯父子宣戰
Germany has declared war on the Jones boys.

713
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:23,110
- 爸  - 什麼事？
- Dad!    - What?

714
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,820
到壁爐那邊去
Head for the fireplace!

715
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:40,630
我有辦法將繩子鬆開
I think I can get these ropes off.

716
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:55,230
情況還是沒有改善
Our situation has not improved.

717
01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:57,570
聽著  我快把繩子拉開來了
Listen, Dad, I'm almost free.

718
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:15,370
警報
Alarm!

719
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:25,590
這真的是太誇張了
This is intolerable.

720
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:27,350
我自由了  爸
I'm out, Dad.

721
01:01:27,430 --> 01:01:29,180
做得好  兒子
Well done, boy.

722
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:07,090
快來吧  爸
Come on, Dad.

723
01:02:13,350 --> 01:02:15,140
這是死路
Dead end.

724
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:19,190
這堣@定有暗門
There's got to be a...A secret door or a...

725
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:20,440
或秘密通道
Passageway or something.

726
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:23,820
我發現只要坐下來好好思考
I find that if I just sit down and think...

727
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:28,990
爸
Dad!

728
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:34,620
答案自然而然就會出現
...the solution presents itself.

729
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:45,010
太棒了  又是船
Great. More boats.

730
01:02:48,090 --> 01:02:51,640
你平常都是這麼過日子的嗎？
You say this has been just another typical day for you, huh?

731
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:56,230
不  今天的情況還算不錯
No! But better than most.

732
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:00,770
快來吧  爸
Come on, Dad. Come on.

733
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,570
什麼？
What about the boat?

734
01:03:02,650 --> 01:03:03,900
我們不搭船嗎？
We're not going on the boat?

735
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,080
瓊斯
Jones!

736
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:33,820
站住  站住
Halt! Halt!

737
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:34,310
威尼斯- 柏林

738
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:37,850
- 快停車  - 什麼？
- Stop!   - What?

739
01:05:37,930 --> 01:05:40,010
快停車
Stop! Stop!

740
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:44,350
你走錯方向了  我們得到柏林去
You're going the wrong way. We have to get to Berlin.

741
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,890
布魯迪在這邊
Brody's this way.

742
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:47,770
我的日記在柏林
My diary's in Berlin.

743
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:49,820
我們不需要那本日記
We don't need the diary, Dad.

744
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:51,320
地圖在布魯迪手上
Marcus has the map.

745
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:54,610
那本日記堣ㄔu畫了地圖
There is more in the diary than just the map.

746
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:57,620
好吧  爸  快告訴我
All right, Dad. Tell me.

747
01:05:59,370 --> 01:06:03,910
找到聖盃的人  必須面對最後的挑戰
Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.

748
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,790
什麼最後的挑戰？
What final challenge?

749
01:06:05,870 --> 01:06:08,670
你得通過三項狡猾的考驗
Three devices of such lethal cunning.

750
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:10,380
- 你是指機關嗎？ - 沒錯
- Booby traps?     - Yes.

751
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:15,300
我找到了能讓我們安全通過的線索
But I found the clues that will safely take us through,

752
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:17,590
就在聖安生編年史
in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.

753
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,300
到底是什麼？
Well, what are they?

754
01:06:22,850 --> 01:06:24,720
你不記得了嗎？
Can't you remember?

755
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:30,510
我把它們寫在日記  那樣就不必花腦筋去記了
I wrote them down in my diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.

756
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:33,730
一半的德國大軍都在追我們  你想到柏林去？
Half the German army's on our tail, and you want me to go to Berlin?

757
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:35,820
- 深入虎穴？ - 沒錯
- Into the lion's den?   - Yes.

758
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:38,070
最重要的事就是找到聖盃
The only thing that matters is the Grail.

759
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,620
馬庫斯該怎麼辦？
What about Marcus?

760
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:41,780
他會同意我的做法
Marcus would agree with me.

761
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:44,120
兩個無私的殉教者
Two selfless martyrs.

762
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,040
去他的耶穌基督
Jesus Christ.

763
01:06:49,290 --> 01:06:51,880
那是教訓你不該褻瀆上帝
That's for blasphemy.

764
01:06:54,630 --> 01:06:58,960
尋找聖盃  不是為了尋找考古證據
The quest for the Grail is not archeology.

765
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,930
這是一場正邪戰爭
It's a race against evil.

766
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:04,810
如果它落入納粹手中
If it is captured by the Nazis,

767
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:08,520
黑暗大軍將會征服全世界
the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the Earth.

768
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,690
你瞭解嗎？
Do you understand me?

769
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,690
你太著迷了  爸
This is an obsession, Dad.

770
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:17,730
我從來就不瞭解  真的不瞭解
I never understood it. Never.

771
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,200
媽媽也不瞭解
Neither did Mom.

772
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:22,950
不  她瞭解
Yes, she did.

773
01:07:23,030 --> 01:07:25,450
問題出在她太瞭解了
Only too well.

774
01:07:26,370 --> 01:07:30,490
我真的很遺憾  她對我隱瞞她的病情
Unfortunately, she kept her illness from me

775
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:33,490
我知道時  她已經沒救了
until all I could do was mourn her.

776
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:45,730
柏林- 威尼斯

777
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:39,360
孩子  我們是這個濁世堛漱@股清流
My boy, we are pilgrims in an unholy land.

778
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,560
博士
Freulein Doctor.

779
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:12,980
- 它在哪堙H - 你怎麼會到這堥荂H
- Where is it?    - How did you get here?

780
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:15,100
它在哪堙H我要那本日記
Where is it? I want it.

781
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:20,900
你為日記跑回來？為什麼？
You came back for the book? Why?

782
01:09:21,650 --> 01:09:23,490
我爸爸不希望它被燒掉
My father didn't want it incinerated.

783
01:09:23,570 --> 01:09:25,200
你真的以為我是那種人？
Is that what you think of me?

784
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:27,660
我相信的是聖盃  而不是納粹
I believe in the Grail, not the swastika.

785
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:31,500
你也是聖盃的敵人
But you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything that the Grail stands for.

786
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:33,120
誰會在乎你在想什麼？
Who gives a damn what you think?

787
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:35,250
你就在乎
You do.

788
01:09:35,330 --> 01:09:38,420
我會狠狠地教訓你
All I have to do is squeeze.

789
01:09:38,670 --> 01:09:41,660
我會放聲大叫
All I have to do is scream.

790
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:53,850
到手了  我們快離開這塈a
I've got it. Let's get the hell out of here.

791
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:31,490
阿道夫•希特勒

792
01:10:43,950 --> 01:10:48,170
柏林機場

793
01:11:06,550 --> 01:11:09,200
- 你買到票了嗎？ - 我買了最快離開德國的機票
- What did you get?   - I don't know. First available flight out of Germany.

794
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:11,010
很好
Good.

795
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:39,370
我們成功了
Well, we made it.

796
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:43,380
一旦我們順利升空  把德國人全都甩在腦後
When we're airborne, with Germany behind us,

797
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:45,800
我才會說我跟你有同感
then I'll share that sentiment.

798
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:47,510
放輕鬆
Relax.

799
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:35,350
請把票拿出來
Tickets, please.

800
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:49,940
您好  亨利•瓊斯
Guten Tag, Herny Jones.

801
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:55,870
請把票拿出來
Tickets, please.

802
01:13:07,090 --> 01:13:09,000
我們應該離開這
We should get out of here.

803
01:13:11,090 --> 01:13:12,630
他沒有票
No ticket.

804
01:13:15,550 --> 01:13:16,550
我有票
Ticket.

805
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:18,930
- 我的票在這  - 我的票在這
- Ticket!       - Ticket!

806
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:42,700
分享你的冒險經歷  是相當有趣的經驗
You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.

807
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:45,000
我們分享的不只是這個
That's not all we shared.

808
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:49,000
那真的是太丟臉了  你老到可以當她的爺爺
It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa...Her grandfather.

809
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:51,000
我跟其他男人一樣都是人
Well, I'm as human as the next man.

810
01:13:51,090 --> 01:13:53,610
我是她的下一個男人
I was the next man.

811
01:13:56,090 --> 01:13:59,400
沒錯  你就像是在黑暗中航行的船隻
Of course. Well... Ships that pass in the night.

812
01:14:00,010 --> 01:14:03,520
還記得我們上一次坐下來喝一杯的事嗎？
Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink?

813
01:14:05,310 --> 01:14:07,310
當時我喝的是牛奶
I had a milkshake.

814
01:14:08,230 --> 01:14:10,150
我們聊了什麼事？
What did we talk about?

815
01:14:11,230 --> 01:14:13,030
我們根本沒說話
We didn't talk.

816
01:14:14,070 --> 01:14:16,030
我們從不聊天
We never talked.

817
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:20,120
你在責備我嗎？
Do I detect a rebuke?

818
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:24,450
我只是很遺憾  我們相依為命
A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad.

819
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:27,080
成長的路對我來說太寂寞了
It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too.

820
01:14:27,170 --> 01:14:28,790
如果你跟其他老爸一樣平凡
If you'd been an ordinary, average father,

821
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:30,880
或許你就會瞭解
like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.

822
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:34,170
事實上  我是個很棒的父親
Actually, I was a wonderful father.

823
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:35,800
什麼時候？
When?

824
01:14:36,510 --> 01:14:38,930
我曾告訴過你要乖乖吃飯
Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed?

825
01:14:39,010 --> 01:14:40,470
睡覺跟做功課嗎？
Wash your ears? Do your homework?

826
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:45,520
從來沒有  我尊重你的隱私  還教你要靠自己
No. I respected your privacy, and I taught you self-reliance.

827
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,190
你只教我  我是全世界最不重要的人
What you taught me was that I was less important to you

828
01:14:48,270 --> 01:14:51,650
連死了五百年的人都比我重要
than people who'd been dead for 500 years in another country.

829
01:14:51,730 --> 01:14:53,690
我非常清楚
And I learned it so well

830
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:55,990
二十年來我們沒有說過幾次話
that we've hardly spoken for 20 years.

831
01:14:56,070 --> 01:14:58,910
你會離開  是因為你對考古學產生了興趣
You left just when you were becoming interesting.

832
01:14:58,990 --> 01:15:00,070
難以置信
Unbelievable.

833
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:01,950
- 爸  你怎麼能...  - 非常好
- Dad, how can you...     - Very well.

834
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:03,990
現在我就在你面前
I'm here now.

835
01:15:05,370 --> 01:15:07,000
你想跟我聊什麼？
What do you want to talk about?

836
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:10,170
呃  我...
Well, I...

837
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:20,010
我想不出來
I can't think of anything.

838
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:22,350
你為什麼要抱怨？
Then what are you complaining about?

839
01:15:23,970 --> 01:15:25,890
我們還有工作要做
Look, we have work to do.

840
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:32,560
到了亞力山勒達後  我們就得面對三個挑戰
When we get to Alexandretta, we will face three challenges.

841
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:38,030
第一是"上帝的氣息" "只有懺悔的人才能通過"
The first, "The Breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass."

842
01:15:38,110 --> 01:15:41,240
第二 "上帝的話語"
Second, "The Word of God.

843
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:44,370
"跟著上帝腳步的人才能通過"
"Only in the footsteps of God will he proceed."

844
01:15:44,450 --> 01:15:46,790
第三 "上帝的道路"
Third, "The Path of God.

845
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:52,630
"只有從獅子頭一躍而過的人 才能證明他的價值"
"Only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."

846
01:15:54,130 --> 01:15:56,210
那是什麼意思？
What does that mean?

847
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:59,920
我不知道  我們會查出來的
I don't know. We'll find out.

848
01:16:06,470 --> 01:16:09,020
飛船在轉彎
We're turning around.

849
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:11,520
他們要帶我們回德國去
They're taking us back to Germany.

850
01:16:18,070 --> 01:16:20,990
我還以為他們不會這麼快發現無線電壞了
Well, I thought it would take them a lot longer to figure out the radio was dead.

851
01:16:20,990 --> 01:16:22,660
快走
Come on, Dad. Move!

852
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:29,450
快一點  爸
Come on, Dad. Come on!

853
01:16:43,090 --> 01:16:45,180
我不知道你會開飛機
I didn't know you could fly a plane.

854
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:46,950
我的確會開飛機
Fly, yes.

855
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:50,520
但我不會降落
Land, no.

856
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:16,670
你得使用那把機關鎗
Dad, you're going to have to use the machine gun.

857
01:17:16,750 --> 01:17:18,500
快點準備好
Get it ready.

858
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:21,260
十一點鐘方向
Eleven o'clock!

859
01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:23,590
爸  十一點鐘方向
Dad, eleven o'clock!

860
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:27,550
十一點鐘方向怎麼了？
What happens at eleven o'clock?

861
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:29,310
十二點鐘  十一點鐘  十點鐘
Twelve, eleven, ten.

862
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:32,060
十一點鐘方向  快開火
Eleven o'clock, fire!

863
01:17:57,670 --> 01:18:00,380
爸  我們中彈了嗎？
Dad, are we hit?

864
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:02,090
可以那麼說
More or less.

865
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:04,510
兒子  對不起
Son, I'm sorry.

866
01:18:04,590 --> 01:18:06,550
他們打中了我們
They got us.

867
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:10,760
抓緊了  爸  我們要降落了
Hang on, Dad. We're going in!

868
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:25,780
- 降落得很漂亮  - 謝謝誇獎
- Nice landing.    - Thanks.

869
01:18:41,090 --> 01:18:42,340
他們想要殺死我們
Those people are trying to kill us!

870
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:44,170
我知道
I know, Dad!

871
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:47,470
對我來說  這是個全新的經驗
Well. It's a new experience for me.

872
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:49,930
我常常遇到這種事
It happens to me all the time.

873
01:19:20,170 --> 01:19:21,880
這真的是太誇張了
This is intolerable!

874
01:19:23,250 --> 01:19:24,630
他們越來越近了
This could be close.

875
01:19:33,850 --> 01:19:35,520
快一點  兒子
Faster, boy! Faster!

876
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:54,030
他們最多也只能追到這
Well, they don't come any closer than that!

877
01:20:09,470 --> 01:20:12,640
爸  他就快飛回來了
Dad, he's coming back!

878
01:20:59,230 --> 01:21:01,850
我突然想起我的查理曼大帝
I suddenly remembered my Charlemagne.

879
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:07,120
"讓我的大軍成為石頭  樹木跟天空的鳥兒"
"Let my armies be the rocks and the trees and the birds in the sky."

880
01:21:20,030 --> 01:21:23,150
"哈太共和國"

881
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:28,340
這是瓊斯博士被撕去的那幾頁日記
These pages are taken from Professor Jones' diary, Your Highness,

882
01:21:28,420 --> 01:21:29,710
堶惘酗@幅地圖
and they include a map

883
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:32,800
指出了聖盃的位置
that pinpoints the exact location of the Grail.

884
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:35,640
聖盃即將落入我們手
As you can see, the Grail is all but in our hands.

885
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:36,930
但沒有你的許可
However, Your Highness,

886
01:21:37,010 --> 01:21:39,930
我們無法通過你的領地
we would not think of crossing your soil without your permission,

887
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:45,160
也無法帶著聖盃離開你的邊界
nor of removing the Grail from your borders without suitable compensation.

888
01:21:47,730 --> 01:21:49,940
你們帶了什麼東西來？
What have you brought?

889
01:21:57,580 --> 01:22:00,120
全是一些很珍貴的東西  殿下
Precious valuables, Your Highness,

890
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:04,410
這都是德國有錢的家族捐出來的東西
donated by some of the finest families in all of Germany.

891
01:22:09,590 --> 01:22:12,380
勞斯萊斯幽靈二型
Rolls-Royce Phantom Two.

892
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:16,590
4.3公升  30匹馬力  6汽缸引擎
Four-point-three liter, 30 horsepower, six-cylinder engine,

893
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:19,470
配備史洛姆伯格公司製造的下拖式化油器
with Stromberg downdraft carburetor.

894
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:22,850
時速從零加速到一百里
Can go from zero to 100 kilometers an hour

895
01:22:22,930 --> 01:22:25,770
只需要12.5秒
in 12.5 seconds.

896
01:22:25,850 --> 01:22:27,900
我最喜歡的是它的顏色
And I even like the color.

897
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:31,500
鑰匙已經都插好了  殿下
The keys are in the ignition, Your Highness.

898
01:22:32,230 --> 01:22:35,110
我會提供你們駱駝  馬
You shall have camels, horses,

899
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,610
武裝隨從  補給品
an armed escort, provisions,

900
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:40,370
沙漠車輛跟坦克
desert vehicles and tanks.

901
01:22:40,450 --> 01:22:42,200
謝謝你
You're welcome.

902
01:22:57,970 --> 01:22:59,090
沒時間了
We have no time to lose.

903
01:22:59,180 --> 01:23:02,320
印第安納•瓊斯跟他父親已經逃走了
Indiana Jones and his father have escaped.

904
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:06,310
我們得從這邊走
We go this way.

905
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:07,980
快把那頭駱駝拉開
Get that camel out of the way.

906
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:12,690
馬庫斯怎麼了？
What happened to Marcus, Sallah?

907
01:23:12,780 --> 01:23:15,280
今天下午他們要越過沙漠
They set out across the desert this afternoon.

908
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:18,610
還帶著他同行
I believe they took Mr. Brody with them.

909
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:22,120
他們拿到地圖了
Now they have the map.

910
01:23:23,580 --> 01:23:25,200
在這場比賽中
And in this sort of race,

911
01:23:25,290 --> 01:23:28,160
第二名還是拿不到獎牌
there's no silver medal for finishing second.

912
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:53,060
你想喝點水嗎  馬庫斯？
Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?

913
01:23:53,150 --> 01:23:55,020
我寧願往你臉上吐口水
I'd rather spit in your face.

914
01:23:55,110 --> 01:23:57,610
但我並沒有那麼做...
But as I haven't got any spit...

915
01:23:59,990 --> 01:24:02,870
聖盃就在三到四里的範圍內
Must be within three or four miles.

916
01:24:02,950 --> 01:24:05,540
不然的話  就是我們走錯路了
Otherwise we are off the map.

917
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:10,670
馬庫斯  我們就快要找到
Well, Marcus, we are on the brink of the recovery of

918
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:14,380
人類史上最偉大的聖物
the greatest artifact in the history of mankind.

919
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:18,260
你們是不自量力  在幫自己找麻煩
You're meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend.

920
01:24:25,220 --> 01:24:27,270
我看到布魯迪了
I see Brody.

921
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:29,060
他似乎沒事
He seems okay.

922
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:34,770
他們還把坦克搬來了
They've got a tank.

923
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:42,070
還有一把小型火炮
Six-pound gun.

924
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:44,030
你在做什麼？快趴下
What do you think you're doing there? Get down!

925
01:24:44,950 --> 01:24:46,990
爸  我們不在射擊範圍內
Dad, we're well out of range.

926
01:24:57,300 --> 01:24:58,460
那是我大舅子的車
That car belonged to my brother-in-law.

927
01:24:58,550 --> 01:25:00,090
快來吧
Come on, come on!

928
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:02,430
上面沒有人
I can't see anyone up there.

929
01:25:02,510 --> 01:25:03,760
可能不是瓊斯吧
Maybe it wasn't even Jones.

930
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:06,100
不  一定是他
No, it is him, all right.

931
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:07,810
他就在附近
He's here somewhere.

932
01:25:08,850 --> 01:25:10,810
把布魯迪帶到坦克
Put Brody in the tank.

933
01:25:17,730 --> 01:25:20,530
陽光這麼強
Well, in this sun,

934
01:25:20,610 --> 01:25:22,950
沒有交通工具  他們是死定了
without transportation, they're as good as dead.

935
01:25:32,540 --> 01:25:33,870
真的是瓊斯
It's Jones, all right.

936
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:40,460
- 他們是誰？ - 誰在乎？
- Now, who are all these people?    - Who cares?

937
01:25:40,550 --> 01:25:42,380
他們能幫我們纏住陶諾文
As long as they're keeping Donovan busy.

938
01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:46,800
爸  你留在這  我們去弄交通工具
Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I organize some transportation.

939
01:26:11,950 --> 01:26:13,910
- 我去找馬  - 我去找駱駝
- I'm going after those horses.   - I'll take the camels.

940
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,580
- 不要駱駝  - 但是 印第...
- I don't need camels.     - But, Indy...

941
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:17,680
我絕不騎駱駝
No camels.

942
01:26:28,350 --> 01:26:29,470
他是什麼人？
Who is he?

943
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:33,180
他是上帝派來的使者
A messenger from God.

944
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:36,980
為了對抗邪惡
For the unrighteous,

945
01:26:37,060 --> 01:26:40,650
聖盃裝載了永恆的詛咒
the Cup of Life holds everlasting damnation.

946
01:26:59,790 --> 01:27:01,880
馬庫斯
Marcus!

947
01:27:03,460 --> 01:27:05,630
"只要能找回聖盃"
"Genius of the Restoration..."

948
01:27:06,090 --> 01:27:08,470
"就能夠喚醒人心"
"Aid our own resuscitation."

949
01:27:08,550 --> 01:27:09,760
亨利  你在這堸竣偵礡H
Henry, what are you doing here?

950
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:11,220
我來救你
It's a rescue, old boy. Come on.

951
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:19,230
搜他的身
Search him.

952
01:27:20,150 --> 01:27:25,520
你的日記堥鴝頃g了什麼東西？
What is in this book? That miserable little diary of yours.

953
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:27,990
那本日記毫無用處
We have the map. The book is useless.

954
01:27:28,070 --> 01:27:30,950
你卻跑回柏林找它
And yet you come all the way back to Berlin to get it.

955
01:27:31,030 --> 01:27:32,660
為什麼？
Why?

956
01:27:32,740 --> 01:27:34,790
你在隱瞞什麼？
What are you hiding?

957
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:38,970
那本日記能告訴你哪些我們不知道的事？
What does the diary tell you that it doesn't tell us?

958
01:27:39,580 --> 01:27:43,590
它告訴我像你們這樣的大混蛋
It tells me that goose-stepping morons like yourself

959
01:27:43,670 --> 01:27:47,160
應該多看書而不是把書給燒掉
should try reading books instead of burning them.

960
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:48,340
上校
Colonel!

961
01:27:48,430 --> 01:27:50,430
瓊斯要逃走了
Jones is getting away.

962
01:27:50,510 --> 01:27:51,590
不可能的
I think not,

963
01:27:51,890 --> 01:27:53,010
陶諾文先生
Herr Donovan.

964
01:27:53,220 --> 01:27:56,060
不是那個瓊斯  是另一個瓊斯
Not that Jones, the other Jones!

965
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:07,440
薩拉  我不要駱駝
Sallah, I said no camels!

966
01:28:07,530 --> 01:28:09,780
你卻找了五頭駱駝來  你不會數數嗎？
That's five camels. Can't you count?

967
01:28:09,860 --> 01:28:12,200
它們可以代替車子
Compensation for my brother-in-law's car.

968
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:14,330
何況你父親跟布魯迪...
Indy, your father and Brody...

969
01:28:14,620 --> 01:28:15,790
我爸在哪堙H
Where's my father?

970
01:28:15,870 --> 01:28:19,900
他在那頭鋼鐵怪獸的肚子
They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.

971
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:43,600
開槍
Fire!

972
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:46,850
爸 爸
Dad! Dad!

973
01:30:46,940 --> 01:30:49,190
- 爸  - 二世
- Dad!     - Junior?

974
01:30:49,270 --> 01:30:50,610
二世
Junior?

975
01:30:50,860 --> 01:30:52,020
二世
Junior!

976
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:11,060
爸
Dad!

977
01:32:11,190 --> 01:32:12,940
爸  快出來
Dad! Get out!

978
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:34,690
亨利  那枝筆...
Henry, the pen...

979
01:33:34,940 --> 01:33:36,360
- 什麼？ - 你沒看見嗎？
- What?     - But don't you see?

980
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:40,090
筆比槍還有力
The pen is mightier than the sword.

981
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:03,630
看看你做的好事
Look what you did.

982
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:05,220
這是戰爭
It's war.

983
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:14,060
我不是告訴過你我們是來救你的嗎？
Didn't I tell you it was a rescue?

984
01:35:17,580 --> 01:35:19,670
- 爸  - 嗯？
- Dad!    - Yeah?

985
01:35:20,630 --> 01:35:22,130
這就是考古學研究？
You call this archeology?

986
01:35:22,210 --> 01:35:23,880
快離開這兒
Get out of there, Dad.

987
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:36,390
我要怎麼下去？
How does one get off this thing?

988
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:44,440
馬庫斯在哪堙H
Where's Marcus?

989
01:35:49,110 --> 01:35:50,700
爸
Dad!

990
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:55,290
抓緊了  爸
Hang on, Dad!

991
01:36:02,170 --> 01:36:04,810
印第的爹  快把手伸過來
Father of Indy, give me your hand!

992
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,090
薩拉
Sallah!

993
01:36:06,170 --> 01:36:07,460
快去救我爸
Get Dad!

994
01:36:07,550 --> 01:36:09,340
快把手伸過來
Give me your hand!

995
01:36:58,100 --> 01:36:59,890
二世
Junior!

996
01:37:01,770 --> 01:37:03,850
印第
Indy!

997
01:37:12,410 --> 01:37:14,530
我的天啊
Oh, God.

998
01:37:14,620 --> 01:37:16,740
我失去他了
I've lost him.

999
01:37:20,330 --> 01:37:22,960
我還來不及告訴他
And I never told him anything.

1000
01:37:25,460 --> 01:37:28,000
我只是還沒有準備好
I just wasn't ready, Marcus.

1001
01:37:29,010 --> 01:37:31,670
只要五分鐘就夠了
Five minutes would have been enough.

1002
01:38:08,630 --> 01:38:11,300
我還以為我失去你了  兒子
I thought I'd lost you, boy!

1003
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:14,970
我也是那麼想  爸
I thought you had too, sir.

1004
01:38:27,980 --> 01:38:29,520
那麼...
Well...

1005
01:38:31,780 --> 01:38:34,820
做得好  快走吧
Well done. Come on.

1006
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:39,660
我們得出發了
Let's go, then.

1007
01:38:42,160 --> 01:38:45,120
你幹嘛還坐在那堨薿均H我們就快到了
Why are you sitting there resting when we're so near the end?

1008
01:38:45,210 --> 01:38:47,170
來吧
Come on, let's go!

1009
01:38:59,680 --> 01:39:03,430
新月峽谷
The Canyon of the Crescent Moon.

1010
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,890
赫蒙特  又有人自願犧牲
Helmut, another volunteer!

1011
01:42:01,490 --> 01:42:04,150
我沒想到還能再見到你
I never expected to see you again.

1012
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:06,660
我天生黏人  喜歡吃回頭草
I'm like a bad penny, I always turn up.

1013
01:42:06,740 --> 01:42:10,410
快退後  史奈德博士  給瓊斯博士一點空間
Step back now, Dr. Schneider. Give Dr. Jones some room.

1014
01:42:11,160 --> 01:42:13,460
他得幫我們找到聖盃
He's going to recover the Grail for us.

1015
01:42:16,540 --> 01:42:20,750
不可能嗎？你覺得呢？準備好要在歷史上留名了嗎？
Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in history?

1016
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:23,920
留什麼名？跟你一樣變成納粹走狗？
As what? A Nazi stooge like you?

1017
01:42:24,010 --> 01:42:25,550
納粹？
The Nazis?

1018
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:28,050
你的眼界就這麼小嗎？
Is that the limit of your vision?

1019
01:42:28,430 --> 01:42:32,100
納粹想在聖盃傳奇中留名
The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend,

1020
01:42:32,180 --> 01:42:33,600
他們想佔領全世界
take on the world.

1021
01:42:34,310 --> 01:42:36,230
我沒有意見
Well, they're welcome.

1022
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:39,480
但我要的是聖盃
But I want the Grail itself.

1023
01:42:39,570 --> 01:42:42,690
那個杯子擁有長生不老的力量
The cup that gives everlasting life.

1024
01:42:43,690 --> 01:42:46,880
希特勒可以擁有全世界  但他無法將它帶入墳墓
Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him.

1025
01:42:47,320 --> 01:42:51,240
我要的是長生不老  他的願望真的太渺小了
I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the dodo.

1026
01:42:55,210 --> 01:42:57,460
聖盃是我的
The Grail is mine,

1027
01:42:57,540 --> 01:42:59,500
你得幫我找到它
and you're going to get it for me.

1028
01:42:59,590 --> 01:43:01,590
開槍殺了我  對你一點好處都沒有
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.

1029
01:43:02,050 --> 01:43:03,800
你知道嗎？
You know something, Dr. Jones?

1030
01:43:03,880 --> 01:43:05,800
你說的對
You're absolutely right.

1031
01:43:08,470 --> 01:43:11,930
爸
Dad?

1032
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:13,680
二世
Junior...

1033
01:43:13,770 --> 01:43:15,560
- 不  - 快後退
- No!    - Get back!

1034
01:43:33,580 --> 01:43:35,620
你死了就救不了他
You can't save him when you're dead!

1035
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:39,400
只有聖盃的力量能救他
The healing power of the Grail is the only thing that can save your father now.

1036
01:43:39,460 --> 01:43:42,920
你該問問自己相信什麼
It's time to ask yourself what you believe.

1037
01:44:18,460 --> 01:44:20,460
"上帝的氣息"
"The Breath of God.

1038
01:44:21,670 --> 01:44:24,340
"只有懺悔的人才能通過"
"Only the penitent man will pass."

1039
01:44:25,630 --> 01:44:28,170
懺悔的人才能通過
"The penitent man will pass."

1040
01:44:46,230 --> 01:44:49,530
懺悔的人才能通過
The penitent man will pass.

1041
01:44:49,610 --> 01:44:51,660
懺悔的人...
The penitent man...

1042
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:59,250
"只有懺悔的人才能通過"
"Only the penitent man will pass."

1043
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:03,420
懺悔的人才能通過  懺悔的人 懺悔的人
The penitent man will pass. The penitent, penitent...

1044
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:04,790
懺悔的人...
The penitent man...

1045
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:07,500
懺悔的人...
The penitent man... The penitent...

1046
01:45:07,880 --> 01:45:10,630
懺悔的人會在上帝面前卑躬屈膝
The penitent man is humble before God.

1047
01:45:10,720 --> 01:45:12,470
懺悔的人...
Penitent. Penitent...

1048
01:45:12,550 --> 01:45:14,300
懺悔的人？
The penitent man...

1049
01:45:14,550 --> 01:45:19,400
懺悔的人會在上帝面前卑躬屈膝
Penitent man is humble, kneels before God.

1050
01:45:19,430 --> 01:45:21,310
快跪下
Kneel!

1051
01:45:29,190 --> 01:45:30,490
我過關了
I'm through!

1052
01:45:32,740 --> 01:45:34,110
我們過關了
We're through.

1053
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:37,830
他沒事
He's all right.

1054
01:45:37,910 --> 01:45:39,240
不
No.

1055
01:45:39,870 --> 01:45:42,620
第二個挑戰是"上帝的話語"
The second challenge: "The Word of God."

1056
01:45:42,710 --> 01:45:46,460
"跟著上帝腳步的人才能通過"
"Only in the footsteps of God will he proceed."

1057
01:45:50,130 --> 01:45:52,510
上帝的話語？
The Word of God...

1058
01:45:52,590 --> 01:45:53,880
上帝的話語？
The Word of...

1059
01:45:56,970 --> 01:46:00,560
跟著上帝腳步？
Proceed in the footsteps of the Word.

1060
01:46:00,770 --> 01:46:03,940
- 上帝的話語  - 亨利  別說話
- "The Word of God..."   - No, Henry. Try not to talk.

1061
01:46:11,150 --> 01:46:17,120
是上帝的名字
The name of God...

1062
01:46:18,780 --> 01:46:20,990
耶和華
Jehovah.

1063
01:46:21,540 --> 01:46:26,830
但在拉丁文中  耶和華的第一個字母是"I"
But in the Latin alphabet, Jehovah begins with an "I."

1064
01:46:27,540 --> 01:46:28,710
J...

1065
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:36,090
天啊
Oh, dear.

1066
01:46:40,310 --> 01:46:42,220
笨蛋
Idiot!

1067
01:46:42,310 --> 01:46:44,680
拉丁文中  耶和華的字首是"I"
In Latin, Jehovah starts with an "I."

1068
01:46:47,480 --> 01:46:48,980
"I."

1069
01:46:49,690 --> 01:46:50,730
"E."

1070
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:53,440
"H."

1071
01:46:54,030 --> 01:46:55,530
"O."

1072
01:46:56,700 --> 01:46:58,200
"V."

1073
01:46:58,280 --> 01:46:59,740
"A."

1074
01:47:22,220 --> 01:47:23,850
"上帝的道路"
"The Path of God."

1075
01:47:27,650 --> 01:47:29,600
"只有從獅子頭一躍而過的人"
"Only in the leap from the lion's head

1076
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:32,860
"才能證明他的價值"
"will he prove his worth."

1077
01:47:36,610 --> 01:47:39,700
不可能的  誰都沒辦法跳過去
Impossible, nobody can jump this.

1078
01:47:42,580 --> 01:47:43,580
印第
Indy!

1079
01:47:44,200 --> 01:47:45,660
你得快一點
Indy, you must hurry!

1080
01:47:45,870 --> 01:47:47,540
快一點
Come quickly!

1081
01:47:53,460 --> 01:47:56,010
你得靠信心跳過去
It's a leap of faith.

1082
01:47:57,720 --> 01:47:59,970
你得相信上帝  孩子
You must believe, boy.

1083
01:48:00,050 --> 01:48:02,470
你得相信上帝
You must believe.

1084
01:49:49,250 --> 01:49:51,750
我就知道你一定會來
I knew you'd come,

1085
01:49:51,830 --> 01:49:54,080
我已經沒有力氣了
but my strength has left me.

1086
01:49:54,830 --> 01:49:56,000
你是誰？
Who are you?

1087
01:49:56,500 --> 01:49:58,630
我是三兄弟中唯一還活著的人
The last of three brothers

1088
01:49:58,710 --> 01:50:01,800
我們發誓會找到聖盃
who swore an oath to find the Grail

1089
01:50:01,880 --> 01:50:03,760
並且好好看守它
and to guard it.

1090
01:50:04,720 --> 01:50:06,340
那是七百年前的事了
That was 700 years ago.

1091
01:50:06,680 --> 01:50:09,010
我等了很久
A long time to wait.

1092
01:50:11,140 --> 01:50:14,640
就一個騎士來說  你的打扮很奇怪
You're strangely dressed, for a knight.

1093
01:50:15,480 --> 01:50:17,270
事實上我不是騎士
I'm not exactly...

1094
01:50:18,150 --> 01:50:19,770
你是什麼意思？
A knight? What do you mean?

1095
01:50:20,360 --> 01:50:22,070
上帝會選上我
I was chosen

1096
01:50:22,150 --> 01:50:25,700
因為我是最勇敢而有價值的人
because I was the bravest, the most worthy.

1097
01:50:25,780 --> 01:50:32,400
我的榮耀將傳給下一個來到這埵V我單挑的人
The honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat.

1098
01:50:33,540 --> 01:50:39,500
因為你打贏了我  我得把它傳給你
I pass it to you who vanquished me.

1099
01:50:42,970 --> 01:50:45,380
我沒有時間解釋了  但...
Listen, I don't have time to explain, but...

1100
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:03,820
是哪一個呢？
Which one is it?

1101
01:51:04,240 --> 01:51:06,490
你得從中挑選一個
You must choose,

1102
01:51:06,570 --> 01:51:08,700
但你得做出明智的選擇
but choose wisely.

1103
01:51:08,780 --> 01:51:12,160
因為真正的聖盃會讓你長生不老
For as the true Grail will bring you life,

1104
01:51:12,240 --> 01:51:15,600
假聖盃會帶走你的生命
the false Grail will take it from you.

1105
01:51:21,590 --> 01:51:23,340
我不是歷史學家
I'm not a historian.

1106
01:51:23,420 --> 01:51:25,470
不知道它長什麼樣子
I have no idea what it looks like.

1107
01:51:25,550 --> 01:51:27,930
是哪一個？
Which one is it?

1108
01:51:28,010 --> 01:51:29,640
讓我來選吧
Let me choose.

1109
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:32,560
謝謝你  博士
Thank you, Doctor.

1110
01:51:45,490 --> 01:51:47,450
太棒了
Yes.

1111
01:51:52,990 --> 01:51:56,450
它比我想像中還漂亮
It's more beautiful than I'd ever imagined.

1112
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:11,140
這的確是王中之王的杯子
This certainly is the cup of the King of Kings.

1113
01:52:17,600 --> 01:52:19,600
敬長生不老
Eternal life.

1114
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:56,970
我是怎麼了？
What is happening to me?

1115
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:03,400
發生了什麼事？
Tell me, what is happening?

1116
01:53:26,710 --> 01:53:28,880
他的選擇...
He chose

1117
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:30,720
是錯的
poorly.

1118
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:43,020
聖盃不可能用黃金做成
It would not be made out of gold.

1119
01:53:43,100 --> 01:53:45,270
它是木匠使用的杯子
That's the cup of a carpenter.

1120
01:53:55,410 --> 01:53:57,830
只有一個方法能查個清楚
There's only one way to find out.

1121
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:15,680
你做出了明智的選擇
You have chosen wisely.

1122
01:54:16,760 --> 01:54:21,060
但聖盃絕對不能越過大封印
But the Grail cannot pass beyond the Great Seal.

1123
01:54:21,140 --> 01:54:26,270
那是唯一的禁忌  跟長生不老的代價
That is the boundary and the price of immortality.

1124
01:55:52,770 --> 01:55:55,570
請把槍放下
Drop your guns. Please.

1125
01:55:58,910 --> 01:56:00,700
爸  快起來
Dad, come on, get to your feet.

1126
01:56:15,300 --> 01:56:17,260
我們找到聖盃了
We have got it. Come on!

1127
01:56:18,720 --> 01:56:21,140
艾兒莎  不要動
Elsa! Elsa, don't move!

1128
01:56:21,640 --> 01:56:23,260
它是你跟我的  印第
It's ours, Indy, yours and mine.

1129
01:56:23,810 --> 01:56:25,850
不要越過封印
Elsa, don't cross the Seal.

1130
01:56:25,930 --> 01:56:28,890
騎士警告過我們  不能從那塈漈t盃帶走
The knight warned us not to take the Grail from here.

1131
01:56:55,500 --> 01:56:58,420
二世
Junior!

1132
01:57:00,840 --> 01:57:02,050
艾兒莎
Elsa...

1133
01:57:03,260 --> 01:57:05,140
別那麼做  艾兒莎
Elsa, don't. Elsa...

1134
01:57:05,510 --> 01:57:06,930
艾兒莎
Elsa...

1135
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:09,350
把另一隻手伸過來 我拉不住你了
Give me your other hand, honey. I can't hold you!

1136
01:57:09,430 --> 01:57:11,690
我可以摸到它
I can reach it. I can reach it.

1137
01:57:11,770 --> 01:57:14,900
把另一隻手伸過來
Elsa, give me your hand. Give me your other hand!

1138
01:57:17,110 --> 01:57:18,400
艾兒莎
Elsa!

1139
01:57:28,660 --> 01:57:30,290
二世  把另一隻手伸過來
Junior, give me your other hand!

1140
01:57:30,370 --> 01:57:32,290
我拉不住你了
I can't hold on.

1141
01:57:32,370 --> 01:57:33,580
我可以摸到它
I can get it.

1142
01:57:33,670 --> 01:57:35,960
只差一點我就能拿到了  爸
I can almost reach it, Dad.

1143
01:57:36,500 --> 01:57:40,630
印第安納
Indiana...

1144
01:57:44,010 --> 01:57:46,220
放棄吧
Let it go.

1145
01:58:05,490 --> 01:58:07,070
爸
Dad...

1146
01:58:13,670 --> 01:58:15,500
走吧  爸
Please, Dad.

1147
01:58:46,990 --> 01:58:49,830
艾兒莎並不相信聖盃是真的
Elsa never really believed in the Grail.

1148
01:58:49,910 --> 01:58:52,790
她以為自己拿到了寶物
She thought she'd found a prize.

1149
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:01,170
你有什麼發現呢  爸？
What did you find, Dad?

1150
01:59:01,380 --> 01:59:02,880
我嗎？
Me?

1151
01:59:05,510 --> 01:59:07,680
我找到了上帝的光榮
Illumination.

1152
01:59:16,850 --> 01:59:18,060
你又有什麼發現呢  二世？
And what did you find, Junior?

1153
01:59:18,610 --> 01:59:20,610
"二世"？爸...
"Junior"? Dad...

1154
01:59:20,690 --> 01:59:23,190
你為什麼老叫他二世？
Please, what does it always mean, this... This "Junior"?

1155
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:26,150
那是他的名字  亨利•瓊斯二世
That's his name: Henry Jones, Junior.

1156
01:59:26,240 --> 01:59:28,070
我比較喜歡印第安納
I like Indiana.

1157
01:59:28,160 --> 01:59:30,160
我們家的狗就叫印第安納
We named the dog Indiana.

1158
01:59:30,240 --> 01:59:32,410
我們可以回家了嗎？
May we go home now, please?

1159
01:59:32,490 --> 01:59:36,840
你跟你家的狗同名？
The dog? You are named after the dog?

1160
01:59:39,290 --> 01:59:42,920
我跟那隻狗有很多美好的回憶
I've got a lot of fond memories of that dog.

1161
01:59:44,300 --> 01:59:46,840
- 準備好了嗎？- 我準備好了
- Ready?      - Ready.

1162
01:59:46,930 --> 01:59:50,640
印第  亨利  跟我來  我認得路
Indy! Henry! Follow me. I know the way!

1163
01:59:55,930 --> 01:59:57,810
他連在博物館堻ㄦ|迷路  不是嗎？
Got lost in his own museum, huh?

1164
01:59:59,730 --> 02:00:02,190
你走前面  二世
After you, Junior.

1165
02:00:02,270 --> 02:00:04,020
遵命  爸爸
Yes, sir.
