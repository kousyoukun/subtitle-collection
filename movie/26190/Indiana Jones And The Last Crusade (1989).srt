After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph, it was lost for a thousand years,

Two of the brothers walked out of the desert 150 years later

Not "supposedly", Dr Jones.

This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the knight's story.

158
00:20:54,802 --> 00:20:57,002
��Ȼû������ָ��ʥ��������
It doesn't reveal the Grail's location,

161

It proves the knight's story is true, but it's incomplete.

The second marker is in his dead brother's tomb.

His colleague, Dr Schneider, has no idea of his whereabouts.
