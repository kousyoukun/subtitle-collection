他恶名昭著

They'd just share it out and drink it in the pub.

93

00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,840
如果说这钱是对信徒的回复
If the money's an answer to a prayer,

100
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,470

这么和你说吧

我在逃避军事法庭

他们不会原谅我的

145
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,840
你怎么知道自己需要抗生素

146

我断了两根肋骨

147
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,910
骨折处感染了
There's an infection around one of the breaks.

148
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,510
如果扩散到骨头  我就死定了
If it spreads to the bone, I'll die.

149
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,450
我以前也受过伤
I've been wounded before.

150
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,650
如果你和着酒吃药  不会有效果的
If you drink alcohol with these, they won't work.

151
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:15,450
我需要止疼片

给我二氢可待因[一种镇痛剂]

154
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,930
我四处打听了下你的朋友伊莎贝尔

155
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,170
你是怎么认识她的

156

昨晚的事  你不记得了吗

我昨晚来过
Did I come here last night?

158
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:36,040
没做什么傻事吧
Do something stupid?

159
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,580
你说你走运了
You said you'd had some luck.

160
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,510
你说上帝显灵了
"God," You said.

161
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,150
你不信上帝吗
You don't believe?

162
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:51,160
那你如何解释这身新衣服
So how do you explain those new clothes?

163
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,890
我不信
I don't.

164
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,730
伊莎贝尔有什么消息
So what'd you find out about Isabel?

165
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,800
她不来吃救济了
She doesn't come for food anymore.

166
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:11,040
如果你见到她  把这个给她

167
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:14,150
告诉她来找我

告诉她这里很安全

- Did you break in? - I fell.

171
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,720
你没伤害别人吧
Did you hurt someone?

172
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,720
就摔伤了我自己
Only myself.

173
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,670
你知道人们说你是天使吗

《圣经》告诉我们  在蒙难地[基督被犹大出卖之地]
...Bible tells us, you know, in gethsemane,

189
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,890
与上帝对话  想要避免此事

犹豫不决

193

00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:59,190
没听他说有人要住这里
He didn't say anyone was gonna be staying.

224
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,560
你有他在纽约的电话吗

225

没有  他很注重隐私

243
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,420
你以为自己是谁  我们的老妈吗

255
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,010

00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,770
这不稀奇

257
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:31,480
斯坦利叔叔在纽约也雇了一个

258
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,160
芝加哥的婶婶雇了两个

259
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,030
在美国这是身份的象征

260
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,120
雇他们对生意有帮助

261
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,620
容易迷惑警方

262
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,170
他看着像杀过人

263
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,000
听说以前当过兵

264
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:57,640
这年头要找个开过戒的中国孩子太难了

265
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,970
他们一心想读大学

266
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:04,270
我大儿子在一家垃圾广告公司做

267
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:07,310
拍些狗屁广告

268
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,400
他干得好吗

269
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:12,690
这兔崽子不和我联系了

270
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,030
猴子

271
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,570
你能和他一起干活吗

272
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,950
没问题叔叔
他话不多  这点很好

273
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:28,530
-你想要干活吗  -是的
- You wanna work? - Yeah.

274
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:31,230
你知道我是干哪行的吗
You know what kind of work I do.

275
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:34,300
听说你要找一个司机
They say you want a driver.

276
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:37,200
我干的行当很杂
I got a lot of businesses.

277
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,310
他们说你是条硬汉
They say you're a hard man.

278
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:43,810
这地方可不好混
It's a hard city.

279
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:50,690
只管给他开个价就行

280
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,830
等等
Hold on!

281
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,820
我们能玩那个猜动物的游戏吗
Can we play the animal game?

282

285
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:33,330
有的
Yes.

286
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:35,490
再给我个线索

00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:44,240
可能会
Probably.

292
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,310
它有几条腿
Right, so, how many legs has it got?

293
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:49,540
-两条  -前面说四条啊
- Two. - You said four.

294
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,310
你在耍赖吧
Are you tricking me?

295
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,610
听说他要见我
I hear he wants to see me.

296
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:47,500
搞毛啊

不准贴小姐的广告

300
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,310
你他妈在嘀咕些什么
What the fuck are you talking about?

301
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,980
哪里轮得到你这根葱来发号施令
You're not even a fucking chink to be giving out rules.

302
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,340
给他颜色看看
Show him.

303
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:11,620
新规矩

00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:55,500
我来给上帝的天使送外卖

是由乔伊·琼斯付款的

312
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:13,020
好吧  你没有搞错

314
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:36,010
告诉你老板15分钟内

把给周先生的钱准备好

316
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:40,580
同时  我还要点些菜打包带走
Also, I wanna order takeaway for delivery.

317
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:43,350
这太好了  但是这是什么菜
It's very nice, but I've no idea what it is.

318
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,750
可能是鸭子
I think it's probably duck.

319
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,920
这边还有鱼和薄饼
And there's fish and chicken and pancakes.

327
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:58,420
你女儿和我一周的生活费只有25英镑
Me and your daughter live on ￡25 a week.

328
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:01,090
自从我失业以后
Since I lost my job,

329
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:02,490
只有靠给房东口交来付房钱
I've been paying the landlord with blowjobs.

330
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,370
什么都没了
Everything's gone.

331
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:08,460
我失去一切的时候你在哪里
What have you been doing while they cut everything, Joey?

332
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:10,500
我在打仗
I've been fighting.

333
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,030
还会有更多的钱
There's more where this came from.

334
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,630
很多很多
Lots more.

335
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:21,510
你拿到请帖了
You got my invitation.

336
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:23,510
不知道你会不会来
Wasn't sure you'd come.

337
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:25,040
给流浪汉们买食物  那没问题
Buying food for the boys, it's okay,

338
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:27,010
但这事儿不行
But not this.

339
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:31,980
给我买礼物会让我很难堪
Giving me things puts me in a very difficult position.

340
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,490
你不是只吃素的吧
You're not vegetarian, are ya?

341
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:38,890
你在大街上生炉子干什么
Why are you lighting fires on the pavement?

342
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:40,930
我的中国老板派人来这里
My Chinese boss sends his people here

343
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:42,990
给他的餐馆采购生肉
to buy meat for his restaurants.

344
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,800
我有3个小时的空闲时间
I get three hours hanging out on the street.

345
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,760
在这大街上
Doing nothing.

346
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:51,940
所以我想搞个烧烤
So tonight I decided to have a barbecue.

347
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,870
以前总是你给我吃的
You used to feed me.

348
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:57,840
今晚看我的
Tonight, I feed you.

349
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:04,850
这事儿太奇怪了
This is a very strange thing to be doing.

350
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,290
我很怀念柴火的味道
I miss the smell of woodsmoke.

351
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:13,560
我猜你是不是有精神问题
I'm guessing that you have psychological problems.

352
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,060
他们把我派到一个山头上
They put me up a mountain

353
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:19,200
然后让我去杀人
and told me to kill people.

354
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,170
他们哪里知道  山上下来后会成怎么一个人
What'd they think would come back down the mountain?

355
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:24,940
约瑟夫  我之所以过来是因为得到些消息...
Joseph, I came here because I might have some news...

356
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:29,170
关于伊莎贝尔的
About Isabel.

357
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,640
他们找到了一个女孩

昨晚  我的警方联系人

359

给了我这张照片

360
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:37,950
他们在河里发现了她
She was found in the river.

361
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:40,080
他们需要有人去辨认尸体
They need help with identification.

362
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,690
她是北方人  我只知道这些
She was from the north, that's all I know.

363
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:18,360
你爱她吗
Did you love her?

364
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,120
我们只是一起生活
We shared a box.

365
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:21,960
相互取暖
We'd just keep each other warm.

366
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:27,900
你会去联系警方吗
Will you talk to the police?

367
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,170
去他妈的警察
Fuck the police.

368
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:39,780
约瑟夫  我很抱歉给你带来这坏消息
Joseph, I'm really sorry to bring such awful news.

369
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:42,180
从河的哪一段找到的
Where in the river?

370
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:44,220
靠城市那边  加那利码头
The city, near to Canary Wharf.

371
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:46,350
某个有钱人干的
One of those rich guys.

372
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:48,050
是的  他们认为她是被客户杀死的
Yes, they think she was killed by a client.

373
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:50,250
-警方管这事儿吗  -当然
- The police give a shit? - Of course they do.

374
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,720
大卫是个好人
David is a good man.

375
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:54,690
是吗  他是好人
Really? He's a "Good man."

376
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:57,730
好  好  那很好
Good, good. Good for him.

377
00:43:57,730 --> 00:43:59,360
好
Good.

378
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:06,340
在他妈的河里
In the fucking river!

379
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:09,640
如果你是为伊莎贝尔动怒
If you dare to be angry about Isabel...

380
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:10,910
那你真虚伪
you're a hypocrite.

381
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:14,010
我打听了下
I've asked around about your job

382
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:16,780
你给中国老板干的事
for the Chinese boss.

383
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:18,980
他们说  "疯子乔伊是毒贩"
They say, "Crazy Joey deals drugs."

384
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:21,250
我只管送货  自己不碰
I just deliver the stuff. I don't touch the stuff.

385
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:25,720
伊莎贝尔的尸检显示  她沾染了毒瘾
The autopsy said Isabel "Touched the stuff."

386
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:28,730
可能就是出自你手
Maybe stuff you delivered.

387
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:31,300
你就从来没这么想过吗
You don't put those things together in your head.

388
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,000
你知道为什么她会陈尸河里吗
You know why she ended up in the river?

389
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,670
因为那条河就是起这个作用的
Because that's what the river's for.

390
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:38,770
富人们玩腻了  河流帮着冲刷干净
To wash away girls when they're finished with them.

391
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:41,710
这城市的肮脏勾当显而易见
I see what's happening in this fucking city.

392
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:42,940
最近你给多少人送过吃的
How many people you feed these days, huh?

393
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:46,040
你给他们汤喝
You give them soup.

394
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:47,850
他们想要回的是自己的生活
They want their lives back!

395
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:20,810
乔伊  几个月前  当你嗑药磕嗨的时候
Joey, when you were out of your head on drugs

396
00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:22,950
你给了我些钱
a few months ago, you gave me some money.

397
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,750
我用那钱给自己买了些东西
I've spent it on something for myself.

398
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:30,490
那以后就没睡过安稳觉
I haven't been able to sleep properly since.

399
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:33,930
我给远在华沙的姐姐打了电话
I-- I called my sister in Warsaw.

400
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:38,200
托她帮我卖掉了一些东西
She sold some of the possessions I left behind.

401
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,840
我不需要你的钱
I don't need this.

402
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:52,910
伊莎贝尔的事情我很抱歉
I'm really sorry about Isabel.

403
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:54,510
我知道你关心她
I know you cared for her,

404
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:58,780
但是请你想想和她一样的其他女孩
but think about all the other Isabels.

405
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:03,290
你浪子回头吧
Start to do the right thing.

406
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:07,990
这钱来路正当  我已为你洗去了罪恶
It is honest money. I cleaned it for you.

407
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:10,800
用这钱开启一个正当的生活吧
Use it to start an honest life.

408
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,980
请你收下这衣服
I want you to have this.

409
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:32,280
这个夏天我会做很多好事

给人们他们想要的东西
Give people what they want.

411
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:36,490
我想你可能想要条裙子

412
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:38,860
乔伊  我是个修女

有修女专门的服装
I used to wear a uniform.

414
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:43,030
没关系  你脱掉就是了
Don't mean a thing, you just take it off.

415
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,800
如果你穿着合身
If it looks beautiful on you,

416
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,530
上帝也会准许的  不是吗
then god would say it's okay, wouldn't he?

417
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,470
我会把这衣服捐给非洲
I will put it in the bag of clothes for Africa.

422
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:15,330
她为政策制定出谋划策...
Advising on policies and influencing...

423
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,470
操

424
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:44,190
交钱  交货
Your cash and your rocks, boys.

425
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:55,370
你不记得我了
Don't remember me, do you?

426
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,200
也难怪
Not surprised.

427
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,470

430

我不知道
I don't know.

434
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:07,970
我需要情报  所以才留你狗命
You're only alive because I need information.

435
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,410
以眼还眼

436
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:16,710
告诉我她的遭遇
You tell me what happened to her,

437
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,650
要不然我用勺子解决你

有个客户一直点她

打她
Beat her up.

00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:28,030
有次他来找她

我们不问名字
We don't use names.

00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,630
他长什么样
Describe him to me.

445

眼睛上有条疤

448
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,350
我就知道那么多
That's all I know.

449
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:55,320
这两个人要是再找你们麻烦
You get any trouble from these two again,

450
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:57,250
你们来找我疯子乔
You tell Crazy Joe, okay?

451
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,100
上帝
Jesus.

452
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:32,080
我靠
Fuck.

453
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:34,650
你看上去...
You look...

454
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:36,090
你留言说关于杀害伊莎贝尔的凶手
Your note said you had information

455
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:38,420
你有信息要提供给警方
for the police about isabel's killer.

456
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:40,390
因为如此我才来的
That is the only reason I am here.

457
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:42,560
我穿这裙子
And I put on this dress because

458
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,100
因为我只有这一条裙子
it is the only dress I have.

459
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,770
别以为我不会把它捐到非洲去
And don't think I won't send it to Africa.

460
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:49,270
我会的
Because I will.

461
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:53,700
顺便说下  他们认为我是叫达蒙
They think my name's Damon, by the way.

462
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:55,370
别提醒我
Please don't remind me.

463
00:51:57,310 --> 00:51:59,780
-我想我要晕了  -什么
- I think I might faint. - What?

464
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:01,810
我一天都没吃东西
I haven't eaten anything all day...

465
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:04,120
纠结着是否要来
Worrying whether or not I would come.

466
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,460
而且  我不知道
Also, I didn't realize

467
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:12,690
这里会有那么多裸男的照片
there would be so many naked men.

468
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:23,470
我之所以安排在这里见面
Look, I arranged to meet you here

469
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:25,440
因为我想你喜欢摄影
because I thought you might like the photographs.

470
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,770
我不知道这些照片
I didn't realize there'd be photographs

471
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:28,640
是拍男人老二的

472
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:31,410
抱歉
Sorry.

473
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:34,210
乔伊  事实上  我喜欢摄影
Joey, actually, I do like photographs.

474
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:37,380
我自己也拍照片  通常是自然景色

475
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:40,650
老二也属于自然景色

476
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:42,850
是的  也算
Yes, I suppose they are.

477
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,390
你是怎么和你们院长说的
So what'd you tell the mother?

478
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:47,260
我说谎了  一次又一次
I lied, I lied, I lied.

479
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:50,760
那么你有什么消息

480
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,630
告诉警方  找一个年龄30左右的男性

489

我是卡尔  您是哪位
I'm Karl. What's your name?

490
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:16,520
我们就随便逛逛
Just looking around.

491
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:19,760
他们告诉我  你在签到台交的请柬
I'm told the invitation you handed in at the desk

492
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,890
是寄给达蒙·科菲尔德的

493

我就是他的经济人

494
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,500
他人在纽约

495
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,630
你到底是谁
Who the hell are you?

496
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:47,250
我想你是醉了
I think you're a bit drunk.

497
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:48,750
是的
Yes.

498
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:53,660
自从我买了票子
I'm having a crazy patch.

499
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,260
就一直做疯狂的事情
Starting when I bought the ticket.

500
00:53:58,630 --> 00:54:00,660
什么票子
What ticket?

501
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:07,370
我用你给的钱买了张芭蕾票
I used your money to buy a ticket to a ballet.

502
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,450
你的消费习惯真奇怪
That's a pretty wicked thing to do.

503
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:25,560
但是  要知道
But, you see...

504
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,630
我从小就仰慕她
I've loved her since I was a little girl.

505
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:30,890
仰慕谁
Loved who?

506
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
玛利亚·叶林斯卡
Maria Zielinska.

507
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:39,670
她42岁了  还在跳舞
She's 42 and still dancing.

508
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:43,570
她一直是我的榜样
She is who I always wanted to be.

509
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:47,340
我就应该成为她那样的人
She is who I should have been.

510
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:57,620
而现在  我穿着丝裙  站在巷子里
I'm in a silk dress in an alleyway...

511
00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:58,760
身边有位黑帮
with a gangster.

512
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,760
还喝醉了酒
And I'm drunk.

513
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,390
乔伊  你还是黑帮吗
Are you still a gangster, Joey,

514
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:08,470
我有没有改变你
or did I change you?

515
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,470
这对我来说也是件疯狂的事
Just having a crazy patch, too.

516
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:19,010
但有些事我必须要完成
There are things that I have to do.

517
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:21,880
夏天结束时  我就收手
When the summer's over, I'll stop.

518
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:24,380
是因为我吗
Because of me, yes?

519
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:26,350
我必须知道自己在做好事
I have to think I'm doing good.

520
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:30,720
这就是你穿漂亮裙子的借口吗
Your excuse for wearing a pretty dress.

521
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:38,060
达蒙什么时候回来
When does Damon return?

522
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,030
十月一日
October the first.

523
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:44,000
命运如此
Then it's fate.

524
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,570
什么
What is?

525
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:48,970
说是命运
When I say it's fate...

526
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:52,440
我应该说是上帝  但是我没那么说
I should really say it's god, but I don't.

527
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,650
知道为什么吗
You know why?

528
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:01,490
因为我不确定上帝是否存在
Because I'm not so sure that god is there anymore.

529
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,620
就因为这个
That's the truth.

530
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:15,430
我觉得我要吐了
I think I'm going to throw up.

531
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:19,400
我没事
No, I'm fine.

532

修女  我是天主教徒
Sister, I'm catholic.

533
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:35,720
我不是你的修女
I'm not your Sister.

534
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,760
我醉了  靠墙而站
I'm drunk and I'm up against the wall.

00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:12,720

00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:06,670
我只收现金
I'm taking the cash.

565
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:14,950
把现金给我
Give me the fucking cash.

566
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:18,720
你让开
Step out of the way, my friend.

567
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:21,620
让我拿些现金
And let me take some of what you owe in cash

568
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:24,020
算你是对周先生示好
as a gesture of goodwill.

569
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:26,620
不行
No!

570
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:45,310
请别伤害他
Please don't hurt him!

571
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:05,360
这钱是我们家的
That money belongs to my family.

572
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:07,000
文森佐  不要
Vincenzo, no!

573
01:00:27,350 --> 01:00:29,050
在妈妈丽塔餐馆
Of mamarita restaurant.

574
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:31,220
克兰西街18号  克兰西街18号
18 Clancey Street. That's 1-8 Clancey Street.

575
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:32,890
嫌疑人名叫乔伊·琼斯
Known by the name of Joey Jones.

576
01:00:32,890 --> 01:00:36,160
没有住址  请谨慎行动
No known address. Approach with caution.

577
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,890
据说与"上帝天使"救助活动有关
Reported connection to the angel of the lord

578
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,100
在修道院花园
homeless mission, Covent Garden.

579
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:51,980
有什么事吗  你吓到我的客人了
Is there a problem? You are scaring my clients.

580
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:54,310
我们在找人
We're looking for someone.

581
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:56,380
这人自称乔伊·琼斯
Calls himself Joey Jones.

582
01:00:58,650 --> 01:01:00,380
听说他过去常来这里
We've been told he used to come down here.

583
01:01:02,650 --> 01:01:04,920
他们说你知道在哪里能找到他
They said you'd know where to find him.

584
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:22,040
我来帮你
Let me help ya.

585
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:25,740
你来这里干什么
What are you doing here?

586
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:37,820
我刚对警察说了谎
I just lied to the police.

587
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:40,120
你一点没变
You haven't changed at all.

588
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:42,090
如果我能干其他活  我早就干了
If I could do something else, I would do it.

589
01:01:43,830 --> 01:01:45,300
你把那人长相告诉警察
What did the policeman say

590
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:47,830
他怎么说
when you gave him the description?

591
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:51,940
他嘲笑我
He laughed at me.

592
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:53,840
说描述得太笼统
He said it was "Too vague."

593
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,940
他说要你自己去
He said, "Tell Joey Jones to come

594
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:57,970
描述给他听
and speak to us himself."

595
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:59,980
你的意思是  他们压根不准备调查
You mean they can't be bothered to fucking look

596
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:02,150
就因为她是个妓女
'cause she was a whore.

597
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:05,280
事实是
The truth is...

598
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,880
警方对抓到你
The police are more interested

599
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:08,090
更感兴趣
in finding out more about you.

600
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:11,350
你出名了
You're becoming famous, Joey.

601
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:13,020
伊莎贝尔没有出名吗
And Isabel isn't famous?

602
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:16,930
你真是个伪君子
You really are a hypocrite.

603
01:02:16,930 --> 01:02:21,260
你把那个收保护费得打成重伤送医院
You beat taxman so bad he's still in hospital.

604
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:23,030
你不是在扮演天使
You're not just an angel,

605
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:26,500
而是在扮演上帝  主持公正
you're god almighty dispensing justice.

606
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:29,170
是的  我相信公正
Yeah, well, I believe in justice.

607
01:02:29,170 --> 01:02:31,780
有时得靠自己声张正义
Sometimes you have to make it happen yourself.

608
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:34,810
这儿可不只我一个伪君子
I'm not the only hypocrite here.

609
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:38,480
想要接吻吗
Want a kiss?

610
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:56,330
-对不起  -从我的轿车上下去
- Sorry. - Get out of my car.

611
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:57,530
这是辆货车
It's a van.

612
01:03:03,310 --> 01:03:05,940
我想你一定觉得我醉了很好玩
I suppose you think it was very funny that I got drunk.

613
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:08,780
我自己偶尔也醉酒
I've been drunk myself on occasion.

614
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:10,510
当时发生什么事
What exactly happened?

615
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:11,920
你不记得了
You don't remember?

616
01:03:13,350 --> 01:03:15,550
印象模糊
It's all a blur.

617
01:03:15,550 --> 01:03:17,950
你让我吻你  我吻了你
You asked me to kiss you, so I kissed you.

618
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:26,230
你不必因为我让你吻
You didn't have to kiss me

619
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:28,870
而吻我
just because I asked.

620
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:31,070
我愿意
I wanted to.

621
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:42,580
你为什么愿意
Why did you want to?

622
01:03:42,580 --> 01:03:44,480
这问题好傻
That's a really stupid question.

623
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:48,520
你找找镜子
Look in the mirror.

624
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:52,360
我成现在这样子  妈的不是我的错
It's not my fault that I'm fucked up.

625
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:54,960
作为修女  你的言语够粗俗的
For a nun, your language is pretty bad.

626
01:03:59,230 --> 01:04:01,160
那是谁的错
So whose fault is it?

627
01:04:22,290 --> 01:04:24,190
是我的体操教练
He was my gymnastics instructor.

628
01:04:29,590 --> 01:04:31,600
事情发生在华沙
It was in Warsaw.

629
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:39,540
我父亲逼我练体操
It was my father who made me do gymnastics.

630
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:44,340
我想跳芭蕾
I wanted to be a ballerina,

631
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:46,110
但他不同意
but he said no.

632
01:04:57,020 --> 01:05:00,520
如果我跳了芭蕾
If I had become a ballerina,

633
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:01,660
就不会出事了
it wouldn't have happened.

634
01:05:11,470 --> 01:05:13,570
我的体操教练开始...
My instructor began to...

635
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:25,020
从我10岁起  他就开始侵犯我
He began to do it when I was 10 years old.

636
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:34,360
他侵犯了我17次
He did it 17 times.

637
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,030
第18次的时候
It was going to be the 18th time.

638
01:05:54,210 --> 01:05:56,950
之后的很长时间  我觉得自己该下地狱
For a very long time, I believed I belonged in hell.

639
01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:01,690
因为我还小
Because I was so young...

640
01:06:03,650 --> 01:06:06,460
他们决定不把我送进监狱
they decided not to send me to prison.

641
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:15,330
而是把我送到修道院
Instead, they sent me to a convent.

642
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,710
乔伊
Joey, I...

643
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:34,550
我从没对人提起过这事
I have never told this to anyone before.

644
01:06:42,690 --> 01:06:44,330
要我来开车吗
Want me to drive?

645
01:06:44,330 --> 01:06:47,160
非常想
I want someone to drive.

646
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:04,580
送到这儿就行了
Here will be fine.

647
01:07:15,130 --> 01:07:16,630
你怎么回去
How will you get home?

648
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:22,630
我是黑帮  偷辆车
I'm a gangster. I'll steal a car.

649
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:32,640
我走回去
I'll walk.

650
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:34,810
是个美好的早晨
It's a lovely morning.

651
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:42,120
克里斯提娜  到最后
Cristina, in the end,

652
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:44,550
我脱下军装  撒腿就跑
I just took off my uniform and ran.

653
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:50,090
看看你都成什么样了
And look what happened to you.

654
01:08:03,410 --> 01:08:05,380
克里斯提娜修女  我很吃惊
Sister Cristina, I am deeply shocked.

655
01:08:07,210 --> 01:08:09,610
你提出了去非洲的申请
You filled in the Africa application.

656
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:12,480
我倾向去塞拉利昂的山谷
My preference is for the valley mission in Sierra Leone.

657
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,320
那你在这里的工作呢
But what about your work here

658
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:15,590
苏豪区的工作怎么办
at the Soho mission?

659
01:08:15,590 --> 01:08:18,560
去非洲一直是我的计划
Africa was always part of my life plan.

660
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,760
是的  但那是两年后
Yes, in two years.

661
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:23,260
我想要提前
I want permission to move it forward.

662
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:26,560
为什么
But why?

663
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:29,400
我感觉在伦敦有太多东西让我分神
I am finding there are too many distractions here in London.

664
01:08:31,470 --> 01:08:33,200
你脸红了
You're blushing.

665
01:08:33,210 --> 01:08:35,110
这里很热
It's very warm in here.

666
01:08:35,110 --> 01:08:36,610
塞拉利昂会更热
It's even warmer in Sierra Leone.

667
01:08:36,610 --> 01:08:38,440
炙热
Hot, even.

668
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:41,180
那我就戴个帽子
I will wear a hat.

669
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:50,150
你提请这个季度出发
You have applied to leave in this quarter.

670
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:53,290
我准备好了  10月1日之后随时能出发
I am ready to leave any time after October the first.

671
01:09:04,270 --> 01:09:08,440
乔伊  听说你要找老板
Joey, they said you wanted to speak to the boss.

672
01:09:11,910 --> 01:09:13,340
跟我来
Come with me.

673
01:09:21,650 --> 01:09:22,750
坐下
Sit.

674
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:30,430
夫人  这一块发生的事情
Madame, you know everything that happens

675
01:09:30,430 --> 01:09:31,830
您都知晓
in your back garden.

676
01:09:33,630 --> 01:09:36,670
如果有个男的招妓  而且又很暴力
If a man pays for girls and he's violent,

677
01:09:36,670 --> 01:09:38,640
那应该很惹人眼
he soon becomes famous.

678
01:09:47,610 --> 01:09:49,550
我们不做他生意
We refuse to deal with them.

679
01:09:49,550 --> 01:09:51,920
但俄罗斯人会出双倍价格
The Russians will just charge double.

680
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:54,720
我知道您这儿有份黑名单
I understand you have a blacklist of violent men.

681
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:00,520
我在找一个非常暴力
I'm looking for a very violent man

682
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,730
对女孩动粗的男人
who attacks girls.

683
01:10:05,230 --> 01:10:07,660
他很年轻  30左右
He's young. Around 30.

684
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:11,430
眼睛上还有一条疤
And he has a scar above his eye.

685
01:10:15,910 --> 01:10:18,270
他穿着考究
He wears very expensive suits.

686
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:19,680
我们知道他
We know him.

687
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:22,880
我这描述没有太过笼统吧
The description is not too vague for you?

688
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,410
我们要照顾生意
We have a business to protect.

689
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:26,480
夫人  您是否能
Madame, would you be able to

690
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:27,520
查出这人的身份
find out the name of this man?

691
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,250
有什么他能做的吗

692
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:38,960
可以让他干那个没人愿意做的活

693
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:49,740
等价交换
A favor for a favor.

694
01:12:05,090 --> 01:12:07,050
伸出左手

695
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:09,130
握拳

696
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:46,670
握拳

697
01:13:51,690 --> 01:13:54,190
-他们告诉过你吗  -告诉我什么
- Did they tell you? - Tell me what?

698
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:58,830
他们竟然没告诉你
They didn't tell you.

699
01:14:03,730 --> 01:14:07,200
不要不要  住手
No, no, stop!

700
01:14:07,210 --> 01:14:08,970
他们没告诉你
They didn't tell you.

701
01:14:37,230 --> 01:14:39,070
住手
Stop.

702
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:19,940
58个人
58.

703
01:15:21,290 --> 01:15:23,750
有些还是孩子
Some of them are kids.

704
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:25,780
有些是小女孩  你要吗
And some of them are girls. You want one?

705
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:31,920
说好的信息呢
I also asked for information.

706
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:34,160
会来的
