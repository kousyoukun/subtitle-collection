<i>Moving 964 southeast, over.</i>

2
00:00:18,342 --> 00:00:20,275
<i>Hummingbird drone.</i>

3
00:00:20,277 --> 00:00:22,444
<i>Roger. They're not sure
what that impacted.</i>

4
00:00:22,446 --> 00:00:24,379
<i>Make sure it wasn't one of your friendlies, Roger.</i>

5
00:00:28,585 --> 00:00:30,452
<i>Red Hotel six, this is Longhorn.</i>

6
00:00:30,454 --> 00:00:31,653
<i>I see possible contact.</i>

7
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:38,293
<i>That was right where they were making contact from,</i>

8
00:00:38,295 --> 00:00:40,829
<i>Red Hotel Tower.</i>

9
00:00:40,831 --> 00:00:42,697
<i>There's an RPG coming from the east.</i>

10
00:00:45,936 --> 00:00:48,637
<i>4-2-0,
this is 4-2 Charlie.</i>

11
00:00:48,639 --> 00:00:50,338
- <i>Message over.</i>
- <i>Send, over.</i>

12
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,975
<i>4-2 Charlie, are you aware
at grid 4-1?</i>

13
00:00:53,977 --> 00:00:56,478
<i>...only thing that was
bad about it...</i>

14
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,846
<i>...I know...</i>

15
00:00:57,848 --> 00:00:59,047
<i>...There's been an ambush...</i>

16
00:01:02,386 --> 00:01:05,453
<i>Do you copy, over?
Sergeant Smith, do you copy?</i>

17
00:01:05,455 --> 00:01:08,390
<i>4-2 Charlie contact involving
small arms fire on vehicle.</i>

18
00:01:08,392 --> 00:01:10,092
<i>There are three guys running out there at the back.</i>

19
00:01:14,965 --> 00:01:16,898
<i>Yep, he's got a weapon on the right.</i>

20
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,600
<i>Roger that.
Hummingbird can see it.</i>

21
00:01:18,602 --> 00:01:20,735
<i>He's got a weapon.</i>

22
00:01:20,737 --> 00:01:22,037
<i>He's still shooting up in the air right now.</i>

23
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:24,539
<i>We see him.</i>

24
00:01:25,574 --> 00:01:28,777
<i>Sergeant Smith, I have good arcs on your position.</i>

25
00:01:28,779 --> 00:01:30,745
- <i>I believe he's British.</i>
- <i>He's shooting.</i>

26
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:36,785
<i>Echo 3-5-2, over.</i>

27
00:01:36,787 --> 00:01:41,790
<i>Installation Provost Marshal

28
00:01:41,792 --> 00:01:43,625
<i>Sergeant Joseph Smith.</i>

29
00:01:43,627 --> 00:01:46,628
<i>Absconded from Stanbrook Military Hospital Secure Wing.</i>

30
00:01:52,802 --> 00:01:55,337
<i>Diagnosed with combat stress.</i>

31
00:01:55,339 --> 00:01:57,206
<i>Filed as Department of Defense,
long-term missing person.</i>

32
00:02:12,456 --> 00:02:14,456
<i>Sorry, mate.</i>

33
00:02:32,408 --> 00:02:35,410
Taxman!

34
00:02:35,412 --> 00:02:38,446
<i>All we want is your cash and your rocks.</i>

35
00:02:38,448 --> 00:02:39,714
Joey, don't fight back.

36
00:03:25,661 --> 00:03:27,095
<i>Run, Isabel!</i>

37
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:52,874
<i>Hi, this is Damon.</i>

38
00:10:52,876 --> 00:10:54,442
<i>I won't be available at this number</i>

39
00:10:54,444 --> 00:10:56,010
<i>until October the first.</i>

40
00:10:56,012 --> 00:10:58,145
<i>If you need me, you can call my agent Paul</i>

41
00:10:58,147 --> 00:11:00,448
<i>or reach me on my New York number.</i>

42
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:04,051
<i>212-555-9898.</i>

43
00:11:04,053 --> 00:11:07,488
<i>That's 212-555-9898.</i>

44
00:11:12,227 --> 00:11:14,662
<i>You have no new messages.</i>

45
00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:31,505
<i>Anybody lost or needs direction?</i>

46
00:12:31,974 --> 00:12:36,043
<i>Anybody lost or needs direction?</i>

47
00:12:36,045 --> 00:12:39,046
<i>Anybody lost or needs direction?</i>

48
00:12:40,749 --> 00:12:42,583
Anybody lost or needs--

49
00:12:51,259 --> 00:12:53,627
Oh!

50
00:12:53,629 --> 00:12:54,729
Get off, get off!

51
00:12:54,731 --> 00:12:56,130
Don't do it!

52
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,666
Happy birthday, Cristina.

53
00:13:32,668 --> 00:13:34,802
Actually, it was two days ago, but thank you.

54
00:13:39,474 --> 00:13:41,509
Happy birthday, Cristina.

55
00:13:41,511 --> 00:13:43,744
Actually, it was two days ago, but thank you.

56
00:14:01,363 --> 00:14:02,630
No alcohol.

57
00:14:10,405 --> 00:14:12,106
I'm looking for someone.

58
00:14:19,081 --> 00:14:21,482
Joseph, where did you get those clothes?

59
00:14:21,484 --> 00:14:25,086
Her name's Isabel.

60
00:14:25,088 --> 00:14:26,854
They saw her.

61
00:14:26,856 --> 00:14:28,722
I've come to save her.

62
00:14:28,724 --> 00:14:32,159
Joseph, did you rob someone?

63
00:14:32,161 --> 00:14:35,129
I had some luck.

64
00:14:35,131 --> 00:14:36,797
Maybe God, you know?

65
00:14:39,501 --> 00:14:40,601
God gave me this.

66
00:14:42,671 --> 00:14:44,305
Joseph, I'm going to call David,

67
00:14:44,307 --> 00:14:47,775
my police liaison officer.

68
00:14:49,545 --> 00:14:53,314
This is for you, sister.

69
00:14:53,316 --> 00:14:55,583
You're okay.

70
00:14:57,686 --> 00:14:58,819
Buy something nice for yourself.

71
00:16:23,838 --> 00:16:27,775
20, 40, 60, 80, 100.

72
00:16:27,777 --> 00:16:31,912
<i>20, 40, 60, 80, 200.</i>

73
00:16:31,914 --> 00:16:35,583
<i>20, 40, 60, 80, 300.</i>

74
00:16:35,585 --> 00:16:38,619
<i>20, 40, 60, 80, 400.</i>

75
00:16:38,621 --> 00:16:40,788
<i>450, 500.</i>

76
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,390
Sister Cristina.

77
00:16:43,392 --> 00:16:44,892
<i>So, do you know how much is there?</i>

78
00:16:44,894 --> 00:16:46,927
£500.

79
00:16:50,765 --> 00:16:52,499
A donation is a donation.

80
00:16:52,501 --> 00:16:53,968
I don't see the quandary.

81
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,436
<i>He's quite famous among them.</i>

82
00:16:55,438 --> 00:16:57,404
They say he was a commando.

83
00:16:57,406 --> 00:16:58,872
He killed people in Afghanistan.

84
00:16:58,874 --> 00:17:00,741
That's what soldiers do.

85
00:17:00,743 --> 00:17:02,643
It doesn't mean he's a thief.

86
00:17:04,012 --> 00:17:06,914
<i>Did he say where he got the money from?</i>

87
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,382
He said, "Maybe God."

88
00:17:13,321 --> 00:17:15,990
Anyway, what do you think the police themselves

89
00:17:15,992 --> 00:17:17,791
would do with it if you handed it in?

90
00:17:17,793 --> 00:17:20,294
<i>They'd just share it out and drink it in the pub</i>

91
00:17:21,931 --> 00:17:24,932
or at Christmas, get them all jumpers or something.

92
00:17:30,872 --> 00:17:32,506
Actually, he told me to buy something for myself.

93
00:17:36,878 --> 00:17:40,381
I thought perhaps maybe I could use

94
00:17:40,383 --> 00:17:42,683
<i>just a small proportion of it.</i>

95
00:17:42,685 --> 00:17:45,819
You see, there is something I have been praying for.

96
00:17:45,821 --> 00:17:47,888
<i>You're a good and holy woman, Sister Cristina.</i>

97
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:50,024
If the money's an answer to a prayer,

98
00:17:50,026 --> 00:17:51,659
<i>how can it be wrong?</i>

99
00:17:53,428 --> 00:17:54,995
<i>Let me put it this way.</i>

100
00:17:54,997 --> 00:17:57,798
I've not written anything down about this in the book.

101
00:18:24,693 --> 00:18:26,060
One for Maria Zielinska.

102
00:18:26,062 --> 00:18:27,594
One what?

103
00:18:27,596 --> 00:18:30,864
One for the Maria Zielinska farewell performance.

104
00:18:30,866 --> 00:18:32,966
I'm afraid it's all sold out.

105
00:18:32,968 --> 00:18:34,735
Sold out?

106
00:18:34,737 --> 00:18:36,403
But it isn't until October.

107
00:18:36,405 --> 00:18:38,672
It sold out online in two hours.

108
00:18:38,674 --> 00:18:40,374
Online.

109
00:18:40,376 --> 00:18:42,910
We do still have one box available.

110
00:18:42,912 --> 00:18:45,612
A box?

111
00:18:45,614 --> 00:18:48,515
On Tuesday, October first.

112
00:18:48,517 --> 00:18:50,617
And how much is a box?

113
00:18:52,654 --> 00:18:57,424
A box for the farewell performance is £500.

114
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:09,903
Contact! Contact!

115
00:19:40,136 --> 00:19:41,902
Contact!

116
00:20:29,918 --> 00:20:33,220
<i>...Possible contact.</i>

117
00:20:33,222 --> 00:20:35,022
<i>Hummingbird drone, over.</i>

118
00:20:38,026 --> 00:20:40,494
<i>Yeah, he's got a weapon on the right.</i>

119
00:20:40,496 --> 00:20:42,229
<i>Hummingbird can see it.
He's got a weapon.</i>

120
00:20:44,499 --> 00:20:45,632
<i>He's still shooting up in the air right now.</i>

121
00:20:45,634 --> 00:20:47,801
<i>We see him.</i>

122
00:20:47,803 --> 00:20:49,837
<i>Can we just cut the guy off?</i>

123
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:51,071
<i>Do you copy?</i>

124
00:21:33,948 --> 00:21:35,148
Sister.

125
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:37,184
I'm afraid you're too late for soup.

126
00:21:37,186 --> 00:21:39,653
I'm not hungry.

127
00:21:39,655 --> 00:21:42,089
I need medicine.

128
00:21:42,091 --> 00:21:43,290
You're hurt?

129
00:21:43,292 --> 00:21:45,726
I need antibiotics.

130
00:21:45,728 --> 00:21:48,028
I'm not allowed to dispense antibiotics.

131
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:51,698
But you do it for people who can't get into the system.

132
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,067
- <i>Go to emergency.</i>
- <i>I can't.</i>

133
00:21:54,069 --> 00:21:56,904
Why not?
If you don't want to give your name,

134
00:21:56,906 --> 00:21:59,239
just call yourself Smith or something.

135
00:21:59,241 --> 00:22:00,874
That would be a mistake.

136
00:22:00,876 --> 00:22:03,310
- Why?
- My name <i>is</i> Smith.

137
00:22:03,312 --> 00:22:05,178
Jones, then.

138
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,113
Sister...

139
00:22:08,283 --> 00:22:10,717
I'm on the run from a court-martial.

140
00:22:10,719 --> 00:22:13,120
I was in a Special Forces unit.

141
00:22:13,122 --> 00:22:15,589
There'll be no forgiveness.

142
00:22:18,226 --> 00:22:21,028
How do you know it's antibiotics you need?

143
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,629
I've got two broken ribs.

144
00:22:22,631 --> 00:22:24,097
There's an infection around one of the breaks.

145
00:22:24,099 --> 00:22:25,699
If it spreads to the bone, I'll die.

146
00:22:27,869 --> 00:22:29,636
I've been wounded before.

147
00:22:29,638 --> 00:22:31,838
If you drink alcohol with these, they won't work.

148
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,640
I'll need painkillers.

149
00:22:33,642 --> 00:22:35,876
Give me something with dihydrocodeine.

150
00:22:35,878 --> 00:22:37,945
Yes, sir.

151
00:22:40,782 --> 00:22:43,116
I've asked around about your friend Isabel.

152
00:22:44,786 --> 00:22:47,354
How'd you know about Isabel?

153
00:22:47,356 --> 00:22:49,990
Last night, don't you remember?

154
00:22:49,992 --> 00:22:51,758
Did I come here last night?

155
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,227
Do something stupid?

156
00:22:54,229 --> 00:22:56,763
You said you'd had some luck.

157
00:22:56,765 --> 00:22:59,700
<i>"God," you said.</i>

158
00:23:03,071 --> 00:23:04,338
You don't believe?

159
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,343
So how do you explain those new clothes?

160
00:23:09,345 --> 00:23:11,078
I don't.

161
00:23:12,647 --> 00:23:14,915
So what'd you find out about Isabel?

162
00:23:14,917 --> 00:23:16,984
She doesn't come for food anymore.

163
00:23:25,927 --> 00:23:29,229
If you see her, give her this.

164
00:23:29,231 --> 00:23:32,332
Tell her she can come to me.

165
00:23:32,334 --> 00:23:34,801
Tell her she can be safe.

166
00:23:34,803 --> 00:23:37,938
- Who lives here?
- Me.

167
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,206
- Did you break in?
- I fell.

168
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:40,907
Did you hurt someone?

169
00:23:40,909 --> 00:23:42,909
Only myself.

170
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,855
Do you know the boys say you're an angel?

171
00:23:56,658 --> 00:23:57,691
Good night, Joseph.

172
00:24:22,116 --> 00:24:24,284
<i>The solid sterling silver.</i>

173
00:24:24,286 --> 00:24:26,787
<i>You've got lots of pieces of solid
sterling silver and, of course--</i>

174
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:28,155
<i>there we go--
you can see all of that</i>

175
00:24:28,157 --> 00:24:29,890
<i>from your hat pins to your...</i>

176
00:24:29,892 --> 00:24:32,192
<i>uh-- to your--
shepherd's hook,</i>

177
00:24:32,194 --> 00:24:34,895
<i>your-- your clasp,
your crimp beads,</i>

178
00:24:34,897 --> 00:24:36,830
<i>and six meters of elastic,</i>

179
00:24:36,832 --> 00:24:40,133
<i>one large and one small gift pack.</i>

180
00:25:01,255 --> 00:25:03,056
<i>...showers good.</i>

181
00:25:03,058 --> 00:25:06,259
<i>40s, Cromarty, Forth, Tyne, Dogger.</i>

182
00:25:06,261 --> 00:25:08,195
<i>Easterly or northeasterly</i>

183
00:25:08,197 --> 00:25:09,763
<i>four or five, occasionally...</i>

184
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:14,768
<i>...Bible tells us,
you know, in Gethsemane,</i>

185
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:18,071
<i>talking to God and wanting to
not go through with this thing</i>

186
00:25:18,073 --> 00:25:19,973
<i>and hesitating, you know.</i>

187
00:25:19,975 --> 00:25:21,308
<i>And as all these incredible things,</i>

188
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,342
<i>Judas going to the priests...</i>

189
00:26:10,024 --> 00:26:11,958
<i>Joey, it's Isabel.</i>

190
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,161
<i>There's no need
to look for me. I'm okay.</i>

191
00:26:14,163 --> 00:26:15,796
<i>And I'll just cause trouble.</i>

192
00:26:15,798 --> 00:26:17,397
<i>I've agreed to work for them for a few weeks</i>

193
00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:20,167
<i>until I've got enough for a deposit on a nice place.</i>

194
00:26:20,169 --> 00:26:23,303
<i>Then I'll go back up north</i>

195
00:26:23,305 --> 00:26:27,541
<i>and for thinkin' of me.
When I get away from London,</i>

196
00:26:27,543 --> 00:26:29,309
<i>I'll call you if you're still there.</i>

197
00:26:29,311 --> 00:26:31,411
<i>I've gotta go.</i>

198
00:26:40,288 --> 00:26:43,023
<i>You have two messages.</i>

199
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:13,253
<i>I've agreed to work for them for a few weeks</i>

200
00:27:13,255 --> 00:27:16,423
<i>until I've got enough for a deposit on a nice place.</i>

201
00:27:16,425 --> 00:27:18,992
<i>Then I'll go back up north.</i>

202
00:27:18,994 --> 00:27:20,393
<i>Thanks for looking after me, Joey,</i>

203
00:27:20,395 --> 00:27:22,028
<i>and for thinking of me.</i>

204
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,396
<i>When I get away from London,</i>

205
00:27:23,398 --> 00:27:25,065
<i>I'll call you if you're still there.</i>

206
00:27:25,067 --> 00:27:26,933
<i>I've gotta go.</i>

207
00:27:29,271 --> 00:27:32,038
<i>You have no more messages.</i>

208
00:28:42,344 --> 00:28:45,045
<i>'cause I saw you go in.</i>

209
00:28:47,415 --> 00:28:49,349
<i>I'm gonna call the police.</i>

210
00:28:54,021 --> 00:28:56,256
Who are you?

211
00:28:56,258 --> 00:28:59,192
Damon said he was gonna be in New York all summer.

212
00:28:59,194 --> 00:29:02,095
I'm Damon's boyfriend.

213
00:29:02,097 --> 00:29:03,530
One of 'em.

214
00:29:03,532 --> 00:29:07,067
<i>He said I could use his flat while he was away.</i>

215
00:29:07,069 --> 00:29:08,468
Are you a model?

216
00:29:11,305 --> 00:29:13,406
Sometimes.

217
00:29:13,408 --> 00:29:17,377
<i>He didn't say anyone was gonna be staying.</i>

218
00:29:17,379 --> 00:29:18,745
Do you have his number in New York?

219
00:29:20,548 --> 00:29:23,216
No, he keeps himself very private.

220
00:29:23,218 --> 00:29:26,753
Pity, you could've called him.

221
00:29:26,755 --> 00:29:28,221
Do you have a number?

222
00:29:28,223 --> 00:29:32,025
He doesn't give it to me.

223
00:29:32,027 --> 00:29:33,360
In case I call him late at night.

224
00:29:33,362 --> 00:29:37,030
- I'm Tracy.
- Joey.

225
00:29:37,032 --> 00:29:40,166
Joey Jones.

226
00:29:40,168 --> 00:29:42,435
Damon said I should stay here for the summer,

227
00:29:42,437 --> 00:29:44,371
get my life back together.

228
00:29:44,373 --> 00:29:47,140
So that's what I'm gonna do.

229
00:29:51,112 --> 00:29:52,612
Whew.

230
00:29:52,614 --> 00:29:53,646
Fuck.

231
00:30:35,356 --> 00:30:37,524
Joey, there's trouble.

232
00:31:11,592 --> 00:31:14,594
Fucking dickhead's trying to throw us out.

233
00:31:16,131 --> 00:31:17,263
Is he fucking following?

234
00:31:17,265 --> 00:31:19,265
Dick, mate.

235
00:31:22,838 --> 00:31:25,205
- Here we go.
- It's Soho, I wanna see some tits.

236
00:31:25,207 --> 00:31:26,573
It's late, boys.

237
00:31:26,575 --> 00:31:27,740
You're gonna miss your train.

238
00:31:27,742 --> 00:31:29,609
Who are you, our fuckin' mum?

239
00:31:29,611 --> 00:31:31,845
He thinks he is.
Fuck me if he ain't.

240
00:31:31,847 --> 00:31:34,881
- Tits, mate.
- Fucking there's your tit.

241
00:31:34,883 --> 00:31:36,783
- That's right, mate.
- Here's your fucking tit, man.

242
00:31:38,486 --> 00:31:40,220
Hey, don't fucking touch my boy!

243
00:31:48,762 --> 00:31:50,597
Fucking leave it, mate.

244
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:53,800
He's a fucking soft, southern fucking cunt.

245
00:31:55,737 --> 00:31:57,370
- Easy, pal.
- Fucking get off him.

246
00:31:57,372 --> 00:31:59,539
- You'll miss your train.
- I'll fucking have him!

247
00:32:02,343 --> 00:32:04,144
Come on, then!

248
00:32:04,146 --> 00:32:05,512
<i>Fucking get him!</i>

249
00:32:17,558 --> 00:32:19,159
Now you've missed your train.

250
00:33:31,932 --> 00:33:32,966
Huh?

251
00:33:43,577 --> 00:33:46,713
- You wanna work?
- Yeah.

252
00:33:46,715 --> 00:33:49,415
You know what kind of work I do.

253
00:33:49,417 --> 00:33:52,485
They say you want a driver.

254
00:33:52,487 --> 00:33:55,388
I got a lot of businesses.

255
00:33:58,025 --> 00:34:00,493
They say you're a hard man.

256
00:34:00,495 --> 00:34:01,995
It's a hard city.

257
00:34:17,012 --> 00:34:19,012
<i>Hold on!</i>

258
00:34:41,402 --> 00:34:43,002
Can we play the animal game?

259
00:34:43,004 --> 00:34:44,570
Go on, then.

260
00:34:44,572 --> 00:34:47,774
- Um... has it got four legs?
- Yes.

261
00:34:47,776 --> 00:34:49,976
All right, has it got fur?

262
00:34:49,978 --> 00:34:51,511
<i>Yes.</i>

263
00:34:51,513 --> 00:34:53,680
<i>Um, give me another clue.</i>

264
00:34:53,682 --> 00:34:55,481
<i>It's gray.
Gray?</i>

265
00:34:55,483 --> 00:34:56,649
Yeah.

266
00:34:56,651 --> 00:34:58,351
- Is it a dog?
- No.

267
00:34:58,353 --> 00:35:01,354
<i>Um, could it eat me?</i>

268
00:35:01,356 --> 00:35:02,422
<i>Probably.</i>

269
00:35:02,424 --> 00:35:05,491
Right, so, how many legs has it got?

270
00:35:05,493 --> 00:35:07,727
- Two.
- You said four.

271
00:35:07,729 --> 00:35:09,495
<i>Are you tricking me?</i>

272
00:35:39,626 --> 00:35:40,793
I hear he wants to see me.

273
00:36:03,517 --> 00:36:05,685
What the fuck?

274
00:36:05,687 --> 00:36:07,587
New rules.

275
00:36:07,589 --> 00:36:09,789
No room service cards anywhere between

276
00:36:09,791 --> 00:36:11,023
Lisle Street and The Crown.

277
00:36:11,025 --> 00:36:13,493
What the fuck are you talking about?

278
00:36:13,495 --> 00:36:15,161
You're not even a fucking Chink to be giving out rules.

279
00:36:15,163 --> 00:36:16,529
Show him.

280
00:36:28,475 --> 00:36:29,809
New rules.

281
00:36:42,656 --> 00:36:43,589
No.

282
00:37:09,584 --> 00:37:11,651
Can I help you?

283
00:37:11,653 --> 00:37:13,686
I've got a delivery for the Angel of the Lord's Mission.

284
00:37:13,688 --> 00:37:17,190
<i>45 Margheritas, 45 garlic breads,</i>

285
00:37:17,192 --> 00:37:19,125
45 Coke Zeroes,

286
00:37:19,127 --> 00:37:21,661
<i>45 chicken dippers, and 45 coleslaws.</i>

287
00:37:21,663 --> 00:37:22,995
There must be a mistake.

288
00:37:24,832 --> 00:37:28,801
It's paid for by Joey Jones.

289
00:37:28,803 --> 00:37:31,204
Okay, it's not a mistake.

290
00:37:31,206 --> 00:37:32,205
Who wants pizza?

291
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,193
<i>Tell your boss in fifteen minutes</i>

292
00:37:54,195 --> 00:37:56,128
to have Mr. Choy's
envelope ready.

293
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:58,764
Also, I wanna order takeaway for delivery.

294
00:37:58,766 --> 00:38:01,534
It's very nice, but I've no idea what it is.

295
00:38:01,536 --> 00:38:02,935
I think it's probably duck.

296
00:38:02,937 --> 00:38:05,104
And there's fish and chicken and pancakes.

297
00:38:05,106 --> 00:38:07,940
- And this is from Crazy Joe the angel, yeah?
- Next?

298
00:38:16,518 --> 00:38:18,117
Just drive, man.
Just fucking drive.

299
00:38:25,893 --> 00:38:28,828
That's his little sister.
She won't talk.

300
00:39:00,594 --> 00:39:03,262
Dawn?

301
00:39:03,264 --> 00:39:04,697
It's me.

302
00:39:04,699 --> 00:39:06,866
Joe.

303
00:39:12,339 --> 00:39:14,774
Nice suit.

304
00:39:14,776 --> 00:39:16,609
Me and your daughter live on £25 a week.

305
00:39:18,579 --> 00:39:20,713
Since I lost my job, I've been
paying the landlord with blowjobs.

306
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:25,851
What have you been doing while they cut everything, Joey?

307
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,688
I've been fighting.

308
00:39:50,143 --> 00:39:53,212
There's more where this came from.

309
00:39:53,214 --> 00:39:54,814
Lots more.

310
00:40:37,958 --> 00:40:39,692
<i>You got my invitation.</i>

311
00:40:39,694 --> 00:40:41,694
Wasn't sure you'd come.

312
00:40:41,696 --> 00:40:45,197
Buying food for the boys, it's okay, but not this.

313
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,169
Giving me things puts me in a very difficult position.

314
00:40:50,171 --> 00:40:52,672
You're not vegetarian, are ya?

315
00:40:54,775 --> 00:40:57,076
Why are you lighting fires on the pavement?

316
00:40:57,078 --> 00:40:59,111
My Chinese boss sends his people here

317
00:40:59,113 --> 00:41:01,180
to buy meat for his restaurants.

318
00:41:01,182 --> 00:41:04,950
<i>I get three hours hanging out
on the street doing nothing.</i>

319
00:41:06,687 --> 00:41:10,122
So tonight I decided to have a barbecue.

320
00:41:10,124 --> 00:41:12,058
<i>You used to feed me.</i>

321
00:41:14,728 --> 00:41:16,028
Tonight, I feed you.

322
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,035
This is a very strange thing to be doing.

323
00:41:27,107 --> 00:41:28,474
I miss the smell of woodsmoke.

324
00:41:28,476 --> 00:41:31,744
I'm guessing that you have psychological problems.

325
00:41:31,746 --> 00:41:34,246
They put me up a mountain

326
00:41:34,248 --> 00:41:37,383
and told me to kill people.

327
00:41:37,385 --> 00:41:40,352
What'd they think would come back down the mountain?

328
00:41:40,354 --> 00:41:43,122
Joseph, I came here because I might have some news...

329
00:41:45,492 --> 00:41:47,359
about Isabel.

330
00:41:47,361 --> 00:41:49,829
<i>They found a girl.</i>

331
00:41:49,831 --> 00:41:53,399
Last night, my police liaison officer
gave me this photograph.

332
00:41:54,835 --> 00:41:56,135
She was found in the river.

333
00:41:56,137 --> 00:41:58,270
They need help with identification.

334
00:42:31,271 --> 00:42:33,873
She was from the north, that's all I know.

335
00:42:33,875 --> 00:42:36,542
Did you love her?

336
00:42:36,544 --> 00:42:38,310
We shared a box.

337
00:42:38,312 --> 00:42:40,146
We'd just keep each other warm.

338
00:42:44,317 --> 00:42:46,085
Will you talk to the police?

339
00:42:46,087 --> 00:42:47,353
Fuck the police.

340
00:42:55,495 --> 00:42:57,963
Joseph, I'm really sorry to bring such awful news.

341
00:42:57,965 --> 00:43:00,366
Where in the river?

342
00:43:00,368 --> 00:43:02,401
The city, near to Canary Wharf.

343
00:43:02,403 --> 00:43:04,537
One of those rich guys.

344
00:43:04,539 --> 00:43:06,238
Yes, they think she was killed by a client.

345
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,440
- The police give a shit?
- Of course they do.

346
00:43:08,442 --> 00:43:09,909
David is a good man.

347
00:43:09,911 --> 00:43:12,878
Really?
He's a "good man".

348
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,915
Good, good.
Good for him.

349
00:43:15,917 --> 00:43:17,550
<i>Good.</i>

350
00:43:21,922 --> 00:43:24,523
In the fucking river!

351
00:43:24,525 --> 00:43:27,827
If you dare to be angry about Isabel...

352
00:43:27,829 --> 00:43:29,094
<i>you're a hypocrite.</i>

353
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:32,198
<i>I've asked around about your job</i>

354
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,967
for the Chinese boss.

355
00:43:34,969 --> 00:43:37,169
They say, "Crazy Joey deals drugs."

356
00:43:37,171 --> 00:43:39,438
I just deliver the stuff.
I don't touch the stuff.

357
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,909
The autopsy said Isabel
"touched the stuff."

358
00:43:43,911 --> 00:43:46,912
Maybe stuff you delivered.

359
00:43:46,914 --> 00:43:49,481
You don't put those things together in your head.

360
00:43:49,483 --> 00:43:51,183
You know why she ended up in the river?

361
00:43:51,185 --> 00:43:53,853
Because that's what the river's for.

362
00:43:53,855 --> 00:43:56,956
To wash away girls when they're finished with them.

363
00:43:56,958 --> 00:43:59,892
I see what's happening in this fucking city.

364
00:43:59,894 --> 00:44:01,126
<i>How many people you feed these days, huh?</i>

365
00:44:01,128 --> 00:44:04,230
You give them soup.

366
00:44:04,232 --> 00:44:06,031
They want their lives back!

367
00:44:35,896 --> 00:44:38,998
Joey, when you were out of your head on drugs

368
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,133
a few months ago, you gave me some money.

369
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:45,938
I've spent it on something for myself.

370
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:48,674
I haven't been able to sleep properly since.

371
00:44:48,676 --> 00:44:52,111
I-- I called my sister in Warsaw.

372
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,382
She sold some of the possessions I left behind.

373
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:05,024
I don't need this.

374
00:45:09,095 --> 00:45:11,096
I'm really sorry about Isabel.

375
00:45:11,098 --> 00:45:12,698
I know you cared for her,

376
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:16,969
but think about all the other Isabels.

377
00:45:19,372 --> 00:45:21,473
Start to do the right thing.

378
00:45:23,043 --> 00:45:26,178
It is honest money.
I cleaned it for you.

379
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:28,981
Use it to start an honest life.

380
00:45:44,464 --> 00:45:46,165
I want you to have this.

381
00:45:49,035 --> 00:45:50,469
I'm gonna do a lot of good things this summer.

382
00:45:50,471 --> 00:45:52,738
Give people what they want.

383
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:54,673
I thought you might want a dress.

384
00:45:54,675 --> 00:45:57,042
Joey, I'm a nun.

385
00:45:57,044 --> 00:45:59,044
I used to wear a uniform.

386
00:45:59,046 --> 00:46:01,213
Don't mean a thing, you just take it off.

387
00:46:03,984 --> 00:46:05,985
If it looks beautiful on you,

388
00:46:05,987 --> 00:46:07,720
then God would say it's okay, wouldn't He?

389
00:46:10,023 --> 00:46:12,658
I will put it in the bag of clothes for Africa.

390
00:46:21,301 --> 00:46:23,736
<i>My guest this week is Baroness Glennis Baker,</i>

391
00:46:23,738 --> 00:46:26,739
<i>a emeritus professor of psychology.</i>

392
00:46:26,741 --> 00:46:29,341
<i>She has specialized in the health and welfare</i>

393
00:46:29,343 --> 00:46:31,176
<i>of people with learning disabilities,</i>

394
00:46:31,178 --> 00:46:33,512
<i>advising on policies and influencing...</i>

395
00:46:42,222 --> 00:46:43,655
Fuck.

396
00:46:56,803 --> 00:46:59,571
Yeah!

397
00:46:59,573 --> 00:47:02,374
Your cash and your rocks, boys.

398
00:47:11,818 --> 00:47:13,552
Don't remember me, do you?

399
00:47:16,222 --> 00:47:18,390
Not surprised.

400
00:47:18,392 --> 00:47:19,658
I've changed.

401
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:24,630
You've got a knife...

402
00:47:28,501 --> 00:47:29,802
I've got a spoon.

403
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:39,111
Who killed Isabel?

404
00:47:55,628 --> 00:47:58,464
Go on, Joey.
Show 'em. Show 'em!

405
00:48:15,349 --> 00:48:17,216
Who killed Isabel?

406
00:48:17,218 --> 00:48:19,184
I don't know.

407
00:48:23,456 --> 00:48:26,158
You're only alive because I need information.

408
00:48:27,627 --> 00:48:29,595
An eye for an eye.

409
00:48:33,166 --> 00:48:34,900
You tell me what happened to her,

410
00:48:34,902 --> 00:48:37,836
or I'll kill you with this spoon.

411
00:48:39,906 --> 00:48:42,541
Some guy used to rent her regular.

412
00:48:42,543 --> 00:48:44,143
Beat her up.

413
00:48:44,145 --> 00:48:46,211
He used to ask for her.

414
00:48:46,213 --> 00:48:48,313
He went too far.

415
00:48:48,315 --> 00:48:49,848
Name.

416
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:51,450
We don't use names.

417
00:48:53,286 --> 00:48:54,820
Describe him to me.

418
00:48:56,489 --> 00:48:58,757
- Ah!
- Describe him to me.

419
00:48:58,759 --> 00:49:02,194
He was about 30, city boy,

420
00:49:02,196 --> 00:49:03,862
scar over his eye.

421
00:49:03,864 --> 00:49:05,531
That's all I know.

422
00:49:11,938 --> 00:49:13,505
You get any trouble from these two again,

423
00:49:13,507 --> 00:49:15,440
you tell Crazy Joe, okay?

424
00:50:35,722 --> 00:50:37,289
Jesus.

425
00:50:48,835 --> 00:50:50,269
Fuck.

426
00:50:51,404 --> 00:50:52,838
You look--

427
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,273
Your note said you had information

428
00:50:54,275 --> 00:50:56,608
for the police about Isabel's killer.

429
00:50:56,610 --> 00:50:58,577
That is the only reason I am here.

430
00:50:58,579 --> 00:51:00,746
And I put on this dress because

431
00:51:00,748 --> 00:51:02,281
it is the only dress I have.

432
00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:07,452
And don't think I won't send it to Africa,
because I will.

433
00:51:10,456 --> 00:51:11,890
They think my name's Damon, by the way.

434
00:51:11,892 --> 00:51:13,558
Please don't remind me.

435
00:51:15,495 --> 00:51:17,963
- I think I might faint.
- What?

436
00:51:17,965 --> 00:51:19,998
I haven't eaten anything all day...

437
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,301
worrying whether or not I would come.

438
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:29,641
Also, I didn't realize

439
00:51:29,643 --> 00:51:30,876
there would be so many naked men.

440
00:51:40,053 --> 00:51:41,653
Look, I arranged to meet you here

441
00:51:41,655 --> 00:51:43,622
because I thought you might like the photographs.

442
00:51:43,624 --> 00:51:46,825
I didn't realize there'd be photographs
of men's... penises.

443
00:51:48,361 --> 00:51:49,594
Sorry.

444
00:51:49,596 --> 00:51:52,397
Joey, actually, I do like photographs.

445
00:51:52,399 --> 00:51:55,567
I take photographs--
usually of nature.

446
00:51:55,569 --> 00:51:58,837
Penises are nature, I suppose.

447
00:51:58,839 --> 00:52:01,039
Yes, I suppose they are.

448
00:52:01,041 --> 00:52:02,574
So what'd you tell the mother?

449
00:52:02,576 --> 00:52:05,444
I lied, I lied, I lied.

450
00:52:06,779 --> 00:52:08,947
So what information do you have?

451
00:52:08,949 --> 00:52:11,817
Tell your policeman to look for a guy around 30.

452
00:52:11,819 --> 00:52:13,819
He has a scar above his eye.

453
00:52:13,821 --> 00:52:15,620
Works in the city.

454
00:52:15,622 --> 00:52:17,589
Should I write this down?

455
00:52:17,591 --> 00:52:19,658
That's all I have.

456
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:21,593
Okay...

457
00:52:21,595 --> 00:52:24,863
30 years old, scar above his eye,

458
00:52:24,865 --> 00:52:27,099
works in the city.
Got it.

459
00:52:27,101 --> 00:52:29,067
We haven't been introduced.

460
00:52:29,069 --> 00:52:30,936
I'm Karl.
What's your name?

461
00:52:33,005 --> 00:52:34,706
Just looking around.

462
00:52:34,708 --> 00:52:37,943
I'm told the invitation you handed in at the desk

463
00:52:37,945 --> 00:52:40,078
was addressed to Damon Coldfield.

464
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,481
I happen to be Damon's photographic agent.

465
00:52:42,483 --> 00:52:43,682
He's in New York.

466
00:52:44,884 --> 00:52:46,818
<i>Who the hell are you?</i>

467
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:05,437
I think you're a bit drunk.

468
00:53:05,439 --> 00:53:06,938
Yes.

469
00:53:09,876 --> 00:53:11,843
I'm having a crazy patch.

470
00:53:13,146 --> 00:53:15,447
Starting when I bought the ticket.

471
00:53:16,816 --> 00:53:18,850
What ticket?

472
00:53:22,088 --> 00:53:25,557
I used your money to buy a ticket to a ballet.

473
00:53:31,431 --> 00:53:33,632
That's a pretty wicked thing to do.

474
00:53:41,008 --> 00:53:43,742
But, you see...

475
00:53:43,744 --> 00:53:45,811
I've loved her since I was a little girl.

476
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,080
Loved who?

477
00:53:51,184 --> 00:53:53,185
Maria Zielinska.

478
00:53:55,922 --> 00:53:57,856
She's 42 and still dancing.

479
00:53:59,926 --> 00:54:01,760
She is who I always wanted to be.

480
00:54:03,496 --> 00:54:05,530
She is who I should have been.

481
00:54:13,806 --> 00:54:15,807
I'm in a silk dress in an alleyway...

482
00:54:15,809 --> 00:54:16,942
with a gangster.

483
00:54:16,944 --> 00:54:19,144
- Whoa!
- Oop!

484
00:54:19,146 --> 00:54:20,946
And I'm drunk.

485
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:26,651
Are you still a gangster, Joey, or did I change you?

486
00:54:30,223 --> 00:54:32,657
Just having a crazy patch, too.

487
00:54:34,694 --> 00:54:37,195
There are things that I have to do.

488
00:54:37,197 --> 00:54:40,065
When the summer's over, I'll stop.

489
00:54:40,067 --> 00:54:42,567
Because of me, yes?

490
00:54:42,569 --> 00:54:44,536
I have to think I'm doing good.

491
00:54:46,873 --> 00:54:48,907
Your excuse for wearing a pretty dress.

492
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,248
When does Damon return?

493
00:54:57,984 --> 00:54:59,217
October the first.

494
00:54:59,219 --> 00:55:02,187
Then it's fate.

495
00:55:02,189 --> 00:55:04,756
What is?

496
00:55:04,758 --> 00:55:07,158
<i>When I say it's fate...</i>

497
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:10,629
I should really say it's God, but I don't.

498
00:55:11,864 --> 00:55:13,832
You know why?

499
00:55:16,702 --> 00:55:19,671
Because I'm not so sure that God is there anymore.

500
00:55:21,941 --> 00:55:23,808
That's the truth.

501
00:55:32,118 --> 00:55:33,618
I think I'm going to throw up.

502
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:35,921
Oh.

503
00:55:35,923 --> 00:55:37,589
No, I'm fine.

504
00:55:43,095 --> 00:55:45,063
Sister, I'm Catholic.

505
00:55:51,337 --> 00:55:53,905
I'm not your sister.

506
00:55:55,241 --> 00:55:57,943
I'm drunk and I'm up against the wall.

507
00:56:29,342 --> 00:56:31,810
30...

508
00:56:31,812 --> 00:56:34,312
a scar above the eye...

509
00:56:34,314 --> 00:56:36,815
works in the city.

510
00:56:56,402 --> 00:56:58,003
<i>A massive 50% off.</i>

511
00:56:58,005 --> 00:57:00,639
<i>Rain jackets half price.</i>

512
00:57:00,641 --> 00:57:03,908
Fleece half price,
T-shirts half price.

513
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:06,144
<i>Walking shoes half price.</i>

514
00:57:06,146 --> 00:57:08,113
<i>A massive 50% off.</i>

515
00:57:11,283 --> 00:57:12,984
Joey...

516
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:15,153
H-how are things?

517
00:57:15,155 --> 00:57:16,688
Things are okay.

518
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:18,390
Have you heard from Damon?

519
00:57:18,392 --> 00:57:19,824
Yeah, he's okay.

520
00:57:19,826 --> 00:57:21,092
You seem so together now.

521
00:57:21,094 --> 00:57:22,827
I'm really together now.

522
00:57:22,829 --> 00:57:25,397
You're like a different person.

523
00:57:25,399 --> 00:57:27,999
So, Joey...

524
00:57:28,001 --> 00:57:30,902
are you exclusively gay?

525
00:57:30,904 --> 00:57:33,672
You know, it's interesting...

526
00:57:33,674 --> 00:57:35,807
recently...

527
00:57:35,809 --> 00:57:37,442
I've found myself attracted to...

528
00:57:38,878 --> 00:57:40,278
nuns.

529
00:58:06,972 --> 00:58:08,239
Who the fuck are you?

530
00:58:10,042 --> 00:58:11,309
You owe Mr. Choy money.

531
00:58:11,311 --> 00:58:13,845
What the fuck do you know about Mr. Choy?

532
00:58:13,847 --> 00:58:15,380
<i>He's my boss.</i>

533
00:58:15,382 --> 00:58:16,881
What are you talking about?

534
00:58:16,883 --> 00:58:19,317
Mr. Choy only employ Chinese.

535
00:58:19,319 --> 00:58:21,419
Tell Mr. Choy I'll send him a check.

536
00:58:23,323 --> 00:58:24,856
I'm taking the cash.

537
00:58:30,963 --> 00:58:33,131
Give me the fucking cash.

538
00:58:34,768 --> 00:58:36,901
Step out of the way, my friend,

539
00:58:36,903 --> 00:58:39,804
and let me take some of what you owe in cash

540
00:58:39,806 --> 00:58:42,207
as a gesture of goodwill.

541
00:58:42,209 --> 00:58:44,809
No!

542
00:59:01,327 --> 00:59:03,495
<i>Please don't hurt him!</i>

543
00:59:21,413 --> 00:59:23,548
That money belongs to my family.

544
00:59:23,550 --> 00:59:25,183
<i>Vincenzo, no!</i>

545
00:59:45,539 --> 00:59:47,238
<i>...of Mamarita Restaurant.</i>

546
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,407
<i>18 Clancey Street.
That's 1-8 Clancey Street.</i>

547
00:59:49,409 --> 00:59:51,075
<i>...known by the name of Joey Jones.</i>

548
00:59:51,077 --> 00:59:54,345
<i>No known address.
Approach with caution.</i>

549
00:59:54,347 --> 00:59:56,080
<i>Reported connection to the Angel of the Lord</i>

550
00:59:56,082 --> 00:59:57,282
<i>Homeless Mission, Covent Garden.</i>

551
01:00:07,526 --> 01:00:10,161
Is there a problem?
You are scaring my clients.

552
01:00:10,163 --> 01:00:12,497
We're looking for someone.

553
01:00:12,499 --> 01:00:14,566
<i>Calls himself Joey Jones.</i>

554
01:00:16,837 --> 01:00:18,570
We've been told he used to come down here.

555
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:23,107
<i>They said you'd know where to find him.</i>

556
01:00:39,024 --> 01:00:40,225
Let me help ya.

557
01:00:42,528 --> 01:00:43,928
What are you doing here?

558
01:00:52,371 --> 01:00:56,007
I just lied to the police.

559
01:00:56,009 --> 01:00:58,309
You haven't changed at all.

560
01:00:58,311 --> 01:01:00,278
If I could do something else, I would do it.

561
01:01:02,014 --> 01:01:03,481
What did the policeman say

562
01:01:03,483 --> 01:01:06,017
when you gave him the description?

563
01:01:07,319 --> 01:01:10,121
He laughed at me.

564
01:01:10,123 --> 01:01:12,023
He said it was "too vague."

565
01:01:12,025 --> 01:01:16,160
He said, "Tell Joey Jones to come
and speak to us himself."

566
01:01:16,162 --> 01:01:18,162
You mean they can't be bothered to fucking look

567
01:01:18,164 --> 01:01:20,331
'cause she was a whore.

568
01:01:20,333 --> 01:01:23,468
The truth is...

569
01:01:23,470 --> 01:01:26,271
the police are more interested
in finding out more about <i>you</i>.

570
01:01:27,539 --> 01:01:29,540
You're becoming famous, Joey.

571
01:01:29,542 --> 01:01:31,209
<i>And Isabel isn't famous?</i>

572
01:01:32,912 --> 01:01:35,113
You really are a hypocrite.

573
01:01:35,115 --> 01:01:39,450
You beat Taxman so bad he's still in hospital.

574
01:01:39,452 --> 01:01:44,689
You're not just an angel,
you're God Almighty dispensing justice.

575
01:01:44,691 --> 01:01:47,358
<i>Yeah, well, I believe in justice.</i>

576
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,961
Sometimes you have to make it happen yourself.

577
01:01:51,563 --> 01:01:52,997
I'm not the only hypocrite here.

578
01:01:55,367 --> 01:01:56,668
Want a kiss?

579
01:02:12,618 --> 01:02:14,519
- Sorry.
- Get out of my car.

580
01:02:14,521 --> 01:02:15,720
It's a van.

581
01:02:21,493 --> 01:02:24,128
I suppose you think it was very funny that I got drunk.

582
01:02:24,130 --> 01:02:26,965
I've been drunk myself on occasion.

583
01:02:26,967 --> 01:02:28,700
What exactly happened?

584
01:02:28,702 --> 01:02:30,101
You don't remember?

585
01:02:31,537 --> 01:02:33,738
It's all a blur.

586
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:36,140
You asked me to kiss you, so I kissed you.

587
01:02:42,048 --> 01:02:44,415
You didn't have to kiss me

588
01:02:44,417 --> 01:02:47,051
just because I asked.

589
01:02:47,053 --> 01:02:49,253
I wanted to.

590
01:02:58,764 --> 01:03:00,765
Why did you want to?

591
01:03:00,767 --> 01:03:02,667
That's a really stupid question.

592
01:03:05,437 --> 01:03:06,704
Look in the mirror.

593
01:03:08,407 --> 01:03:10,541
It's not my fault that I'm fucked up.

594
01:03:10,543 --> 01:03:13,144
For a nun, your language is pretty bad.

595
01:03:17,416 --> 01:03:19,350
So whose fault is it?

596
01:03:40,472 --> 01:03:42,373
He was my gymnastics instructor.

597
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:49,781
It was in Warsaw.

598
01:03:55,087 --> 01:03:57,722
It was my father who made me do gymnastics.

599
01:03:57,724 --> 01:04:02,527
I wanted to be a ballerina,

600
01:04:02,529 --> 01:04:04,295
but he said no.

601
01:04:15,208 --> 01:04:18,709
<i>If I had become a ballerina,</i>

602
01:04:18,711 --> 01:04:19,844
<i>it wouldn't have happened.</i>

603
01:04:29,655 --> 01:04:31,756
My instructor began to...

604
01:04:39,765 --> 01:04:43,201
He began to do it when I was 10 years old.

605
01:04:50,442 --> 01:04:52,543
He did it 17 times.

606
01:04:56,181 --> 01:04:58,216
<i>It was going to be the 18th time.</i>

607
01:05:12,397 --> 01:05:15,133
For a very long time, I believed I belonged in hell.

608
01:05:18,337 --> 01:05:19,871
Because I was so young...

609
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:24,642
they decided not to send me to prison.

610
01:05:30,849 --> 01:05:33,518
Instead, they sent me to a convent.

611
01:05:43,629 --> 01:05:44,896
Joey, I...

612
01:05:49,868 --> 01:05:52,737
I have never told this to anyone before.

613
01:06:00,879 --> 01:06:02,513
Want me to drive?

614
01:06:02,515 --> 01:06:05,349
I want someone to drive.

615
01:06:21,333 --> 01:06:22,767
<i>Here will be fine.</i>

616
01:06:33,313 --> 01:06:34,812
How will you get home?

617
01:06:38,450 --> 01:06:40,818
I'm a gangster.
I'll steal a car.

618
01:06:48,227 --> 01:06:50,828
I'll walk.

619
01:06:50,830 --> 01:06:52,997
It's a lovely morning.

620
01:06:57,869 --> 01:07:00,304
Cristina, in the end,

621
01:07:00,306 --> 01:07:02,740
I just took off my uniform and ran.

622
01:07:06,411 --> 01:07:08,279
And look what happened to you.

623
01:07:21,593 --> 01:07:23,561
Sister Cristina, I am deeply shocked.

624
01:07:25,397 --> 01:07:27,798
You filled in the Africa application.

625
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:30,668
My preference is for the Valley Mission in Sierra Leone.

626
01:07:30,670 --> 01:07:33,771
But what about your work here at the Soho Mission?

627
01:07:33,773 --> 01:07:36,741
Africa was always part of my life plan.

628
01:07:36,743 --> 01:07:38,943
Yes, in two years.

629
01:07:38,945 --> 01:07:41,445
I want permission to move it forward.

630
01:07:41,447 --> 01:07:44,749
<i>But why?</i>

631
01:07:44,751 --> 01:07:47,585
I am finding there are too many
distractions here in London.

632
01:07:49,655 --> 01:07:51,389
You're blushing.

633
01:07:51,391 --> 01:07:53,291
It's very warm in here.

634
01:07:53,293 --> 01:07:54,792
It's even warmer in Sierra Leone.

635
01:07:54,794 --> 01:07:56,627
Hot, even.

636
01:07:56,629 --> 01:07:59,363
I will wear a hat.

637
01:08:05,804 --> 01:08:08,339
You have applied to leave in this quarter.

638
01:08:08,341 --> 01:08:11,475
I am ready to leave any time after October the first.

639
01:08:22,454 --> 01:08:26,624
Joey, they said you wanted to speak to the boss.

640
01:08:30,095 --> 01:08:31,529
Come with me.

641
01:08:39,838 --> 01:08:40,938
Sit.

642
01:08:47,045 --> 01:08:50,014
Madame, you know everything that happens
in your back garden.

643
01:08:51,818 --> 01:08:56,821
If a man pays for girls and he's violent,
he soon becomes famous.

644
01:09:05,797 --> 01:09:07,732
We refuse to deal with them.

645
01:09:07,734 --> 01:09:10,101
<i>The Russians will just charge double.</i>

646
01:09:10,103 --> 01:09:12,903
I understand you have a blacklist of violent men.

647
01:09:17,409 --> 01:09:18,709
<i>I'm looking for a very violent man</i>

648
01:09:18,711 --> 01:09:20,911
who attacks girls.

649
01:09:23,415 --> 01:09:25,850
He's young.
Around 30.

650
01:09:27,586 --> 01:09:29,620
And he has a scar above his eye.

651
01:09:34,092 --> 01:09:36,460
He wears very expensive suits.

652
01:09:36,462 --> 01:09:37,862
We know him.

653
01:09:37,864 --> 01:09:41,065
The description is not too vague for you?

654
01:09:41,067 --> 01:09:42,600
We have a business to protect.

655
01:09:42,602 --> 01:09:44,668
Madame, would you be able to

656
01:09:44,670 --> 01:09:45,703
find out the name of this man?

657
01:09:58,116 --> 01:09:59,483
Hmm.

658
01:10:06,592 --> 01:10:07,925
A favor for a favor.

659
01:13:09,874 --> 01:13:12,376
- Did they tell you?
- Tell me what?

660
01:13:15,146 --> 01:13:17,014
They didn't tell you.

661
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:25,389
No, no, stop!

662
01:13:25,391 --> 01:13:27,157
- Ah!
- They didn't tell you.

663
01:13:55,420 --> 01:13:57,254
Stop.

664
01:14:36,261 --> 01:14:38,128
58.

665
01:14:39,397 --> 01:14:41,932
Some of them are kids.

666
01:14:41,934 --> 01:14:43,967
And some of them are girls.
You want one?

667
01:14:47,105 --> 01:14:50,107
I also asked for information.

668
01:14:50,109 --> 01:14:52,342
It's coming, okay?

669
01:16:17,028 --> 01:16:19,029
It's the latest.
Do you know how to work it?

670
01:16:19,031 --> 01:16:20,364
Yes, of course.

671
01:16:20,366 --> 01:16:24,334
You could afford to get a professional to do this.

672
01:16:24,336 --> 01:16:26,503
Yeah, but I wanted you.

673
01:16:32,577 --> 01:16:34,178
So who are the photographs for?

674
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:36,413
My daughter.

675
01:16:36,415 --> 01:16:38,282
You have a daughter?

676
01:16:38,284 --> 01:16:39,883
Nine years old.

677
01:16:42,854 --> 01:16:44,488
I came here with her once when she was small.

678
01:16:44,490 --> 01:16:46,590
<i>She might remember.</i>

679
01:16:46,592 --> 01:16:47,825
I want her to have some photographs of me

680
01:16:47,827 --> 01:16:49,326
looking like a normal man.

681
01:16:52,330 --> 01:16:54,064
What do you think?

682
01:16:55,133 --> 01:16:57,301
Like this?

683
01:16:58,938 --> 01:17:00,003
Smile.

684
01:17:00,005 --> 01:17:03,507
Why?

685
01:17:03,509 --> 01:17:05,843
Okay, actually, you look okay.

686
01:17:07,345 --> 01:17:09,446
Do I look like a good man?

687
01:17:10,982 --> 01:17:12,516
What do you mean?

688
01:17:14,152 --> 01:17:16,220
I want her to think I'm a good man.

689
01:17:17,555 --> 01:17:20,257
Yes, you look like a good man.

690
01:17:20,259 --> 01:17:22,359
So take a picture.

691
01:17:26,898 --> 01:17:29,099
Did your daughter ask for photos?

692
01:17:29,101 --> 01:17:31,068
<i>No, but when she's older,</i>

693
01:17:31,070 --> 01:17:33,370
I want her to have something to remind her of me.

694
01:17:33,372 --> 01:17:35,038
You won't see her?

695
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:38,275
I don't think I'll look like this for much longer.

696
01:17:42,580 --> 01:17:44,948
Why not?

697
01:17:44,950 --> 01:17:46,917
Why shouldn't you stay like this?

698
01:17:46,919 --> 01:17:48,919
Just take a picture.

699
01:17:56,594 --> 01:17:57,494
You should have one like this.

700
01:17:57,496 --> 01:17:59,263
More natural.

701
01:17:59,265 --> 01:18:01,932
The businessman drinking his morning coffee.

702
01:18:01,934 --> 01:18:03,300
Such a successful man.

703
01:18:03,302 --> 01:18:04,601
So rich.

704
01:18:04,603 --> 01:18:06,937
- Charitable.
- <i>Of course.</i>

705
01:18:06,939 --> 01:18:09,239
She will be very proud of you.

706
01:18:09,241 --> 01:18:10,374
Enough.

707
01:18:13,411 --> 01:18:14,378
I said enough.

708
01:18:17,448 --> 01:18:19,082
At last a laugh.

709
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:25,088
There.
I am changing you.

710
01:18:30,595 --> 01:18:32,329
Send those ones to me.

711
01:18:32,331 --> 01:18:34,131
I'll take them with me to Africa.

712
01:18:41,306 --> 01:18:42,639
You're going to Africa?

713
01:18:42,641 --> 01:18:45,475
A valley in Sierra Leone where there is no water.

714
01:18:45,477 --> 01:18:48,245
When do you leave?

715
01:18:48,247 --> 01:18:50,113
Tomorrow.

716
01:18:57,221 --> 01:18:59,623
So this is the end of my crazy patch, Joey.

717
01:19:02,226 --> 01:19:05,095
And I've decided I want to end it with you.

718
01:19:38,696 --> 01:19:40,998
<i>Sport coats, shorts...</i>

719
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:44,234
half price.
T-shirts half price.

720
01:19:44,236 --> 01:19:46,603
<i>I've got rain jackets half price.</i>

721
01:19:46,605 --> 01:19:48,672
<i>Fleece half price.</i>

722
01:19:48,674 --> 01:19:52,442
<i>Walking boots half price.
Trousers, half price.</i>

723
01:19:52,444 --> 01:19:53,643
Keep the change.

724
01:19:53,645 --> 01:19:56,480
...half price.
A massive 50...

725
01:19:56,482 --> 01:20:01,251
<i>...half price.
Rain jackets half price.</i>

726
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:17,601
Hello?
Who's there?

727
01:20:19,304 --> 01:20:22,272
<i>Hello?</i>

728
01:20:25,643 --> 01:20:27,277
<i>Cristina!</i>

729
01:20:33,818 --> 01:20:37,220
Who the bloody hell are you?

730
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:44,061
I don't know who you are, but open this door.

731
01:20:50,702 --> 01:20:53,837
<i>Did you hear me?
I said open the door.</i>

732
01:21:04,615 --> 01:21:07,684
Cristina.

733
01:21:07,686 --> 01:21:11,121
There's enough money in here to get us away.

734
01:21:11,123 --> 01:21:12,255
We could go anywhere in the world.

735
01:21:12,257 --> 01:21:13,190
No, Joey...

736
01:21:15,860 --> 01:21:20,297
if you want to be a good man, be a good man.

737
01:21:27,505 --> 01:21:31,174
Joey, will you come with me to the ballet tonight?

738
01:21:31,176 --> 01:21:34,578
I have a box.
There is room for two.

739
01:21:34,580 --> 01:21:36,413
Tonight at 7:00.

740
01:21:52,730 --> 01:21:54,431
<i>My time here at this mission</i>

741
01:21:54,433 --> 01:21:56,466
<i>has been a fulfilling time.</i>

742
01:21:56,468 --> 01:21:58,468
<i>Surprises all along the way.</i>

743
01:21:58,470 --> 01:22:02,172
Our mission has had some failures.

744
01:22:02,174 --> 01:22:05,308
Some tragedies...

745
01:22:05,310 --> 01:22:07,677
the poor girl Isabel.

746
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:09,746
But we have also had successes.

747
01:22:09,748 --> 01:22:12,482
And we have also had some who,

748
01:22:12,484 --> 01:22:15,352
<i>in spite of how it may appear,</i>

749
01:22:15,354 --> 01:22:17,487
<i>give us reason to hope.</i>

750
01:22:35,306 --> 01:22:36,907
Who are you?

751
01:22:36,909 --> 01:22:39,709
I've got something for your mother.

752
01:22:45,316 --> 01:22:46,650
And something for you.

753
01:22:57,762 --> 01:22:59,462
Can I just hold your hand for a minute?

754
01:23:12,310 --> 01:23:13,677
<i>Ruby, who is it?</i>

755
01:23:24,255 --> 01:23:26,523
You be good, okay?

756
01:23:43,507 --> 01:23:45,709
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

757
01:23:45,711 --> 01:23:49,479
<i>and the farewell performance of Maria Zielinska.</i>

758
01:24:38,629 --> 01:24:41,298
<i>Tonight's performance will begin in five minutes.</i>

759
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:43,300
<i>Please take your seats.</i>

760
01:24:45,770 --> 01:24:47,871
<i>Closing doors.</i>

761
01:25:10,728 --> 01:25:12,562
Absolutely, no.

762
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:26,843
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Maria Zielinska.</i>

763
01:26:08,619 --> 01:26:10,153
Max?

764
01:26:10,155 --> 01:26:11,688
Max Forrester?

765
01:26:13,157 --> 01:26:14,791
Yes.
Who are you?

766
01:26:14,793 --> 01:26:17,093
How was your bonus this year?
Was it good?

767
01:26:17,095 --> 01:26:19,829
It was very good.

768
01:26:19,831 --> 01:26:21,598
Are you from Cisco or American Eagle?

769
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:24,100
No. I'm from down there.

770
01:26:25,836 --> 01:26:28,538
Listen, can I talk to you for a minute?

771
01:26:28,540 --> 01:26:30,940
I was actually just getting some drinks.

772
01:26:30,942 --> 01:26:32,575
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

773
01:26:32,577 --> 01:26:34,711
Let me think...

774
01:26:34,713 --> 01:26:36,479
<i>Oof!</i>

775
01:26:40,885 --> 01:26:43,086
What the--
what the hell do you want?

776
01:26:43,088 --> 01:26:44,921
I think you should know how it feels to be down there.

777
01:26:44,923 --> 01:26:46,623
What?

778
01:27:01,439 --> 01:27:05,608
<i>A reported fatality.
Paramedics are on the scene.</i>

779
01:27:05,610 --> 01:27:08,445
<i>Witnesses report he was pushed or thrown from the roof.</i>

780
01:27:08,447 --> 01:27:11,881
<i>Military Police reference blotter AR630.</i>

781
01:27:11,883 --> 01:27:15,151
<i>Surveillance footage matches visual of Joseph Smith.</i>

782
01:27:15,153 --> 01:27:17,687
<i>Department of Defense,
long-term missing person.</i>

783
01:27:17,689 --> 01:27:20,223
- <i>Do you have a visual?</i>
- <i>Negative, no further sightings.</i>

784
01:28:51,649 --> 01:28:53,082
What are you doing here?

785
01:28:55,286 --> 01:28:57,220
I'm waiting for Maria Zielinska.

786
01:28:59,757 --> 01:29:01,024
There was a party after the show.

787
01:29:01,026 --> 01:29:02,191
I want to see her walk to her car.

788
01:29:23,247 --> 01:29:25,014
Let me explain.

789
01:29:31,255 --> 01:29:33,089
When I'm sober...

790
01:29:36,260 --> 01:29:37,860
when I'm healthy and well...

791
01:29:41,999 --> 01:29:43,700
I hurt people.

792
01:29:45,836 --> 01:29:47,804
<i>I'm lethal.</i>

793
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:52,375
I drink to weaken the machine they made.

794
01:29:56,213 --> 01:29:58,915
I've finished the work I had to do.

795
01:30:13,364 --> 01:30:15,698
And already, look.

796
01:30:19,003 --> 01:30:20,103
You see 'em?

797
01:30:23,073 --> 01:30:25,141
Hummingbirds.

798
01:30:34,084 --> 01:30:37,120
Hummingbirds were there that day.

799
01:30:39,024 --> 01:30:41,858
<i>Do you copy?</i>

800
01:30:41,860 --> 01:30:45,695
Surveillance drones saw what happened.

801
01:30:45,697 --> 01:30:47,330
<i>Roger that.
Hummingbird can see it.</i>

802
01:30:47,332 --> 01:30:49,032
<i>He's got a weapon...</i>

803
01:30:49,034 --> 01:30:51,734
<i>He's shooting up in the air right now..</i>

804
01:30:59,276 --> 01:31:01,010
Please, please!

805
01:31:10,821 --> 01:31:13,022
The enemy killed five of ours...

806
01:31:20,431 --> 01:31:22,832
so I killed five of theirs.

807
01:31:26,170 --> 01:31:28,337
<i>The first five I could find.</i>

808
01:31:33,277 --> 01:31:36,045
I left the father hanging.

809
01:32:28,532 --> 01:32:30,099
You see her?

810
01:32:32,870 --> 01:32:35,071
She is my witness.

811
01:33:22,386 --> 01:33:24,020
Sister.

812
01:33:43,907 --> 01:33:46,075
<i>"Dear Cristina,</i>

813
01:33:46,077 --> 01:33:49,846
<i>I just wanted to say thank you
for taking the photographs.</i>

814
01:33:49,848 --> 01:33:54,450
<i>Considering it's me in the pictures,</i>
<i>they turned out pretty well.</i>

815
01:33:54,452 --> 01:33:58,221
<i>I gave all the best ones to my daughter,</i>
<i>so you're left with the ugly ones</i>

816
01:33:58,223 --> 01:34:00,990
<i>and the scary ones.
Sorry.</i>

817
01:34:03,026 --> 01:34:04,927
<i>I've sent Damon the money I took from his account</i>

818
01:34:04,929 --> 01:34:06,896
<i>and added some extra for rent.</i>

819
01:34:08,932 --> 01:34:12,268
<i>I left the boys at the mission some cash for pizzas.</i>

820
01:34:12,270 --> 01:34:14,237
<i>And I sent details of the people smugglers</i>

821
01:34:14,239 --> 01:34:17,473
<i>to the police.</i>

822
01:34:17,475 --> 01:34:20,009
<i>I also rid the city of a bad man.</i>

823
01:34:20,011 --> 01:34:22,345
<i>I know that doesn't make me a good man,</i>

824
01:34:22,347 --> 01:34:24,647
<i>but I tried to do the right thing.</i>

825
01:34:28,986 --> 01:34:31,621
<i>Now I'll go back to the street and disappear.</i>

826
01:34:31,623 --> 01:34:35,024
<i>I was alive again for one summer.</i>

827
01:34:35,026 --> 01:34:36,492
<i>I'm glad I spent it with you.</i>

828
01:34:38,629 --> 01:34:40,563
<i>I hope Africa treats you well.</i>

829
01:34:40,565 --> 01:34:43,332
<i>All my love, Joseph Smith."</i>

830
01:34:45,403 --> 01:34:50,172
<i>Surveillance camera profile matched to Joseph Smith.</i>

831
01:34:50,174 --> 01:34:53,342
<i>Target heading eastbound on Brewer Street</i>

832
01:34:53,344 --> 01:34:54,543
<i>towards Glasshouse Street.</i>

833
01:34:54,545 --> 01:34:56,379
<i>Absent without leave.</i>

834
01:34:56,381 --> 01:34:58,581
<i>File zero-four-zero
for profile and visual.</i>

835
01:34:58,583 --> 01:35:00,583
<i>I repeat that's east--
east on Brewer Street.</i>

836
01:35:00,585 --> 01:35:03,052
<i>...matches visual of Joseph Smith.</i>

837
01:35:03,054 --> 01:35:04,620
<i>Approach with extreme caution.</i>

838
01:35:04,622 --> 01:35:05,988
<i>I think we have him.</i>

839
01:35:05,990 --> 01:35:07,323
<i>Okay, target in sight. Go.</i>

840
01:35:07,325 --> 01:35:08,457
<i>Yeah, we got him.
Take him.</i>
