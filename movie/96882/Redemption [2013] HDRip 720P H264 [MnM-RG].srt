00:01:02,096 --> 00:01:04,263
<i>Roger. They're not sure</i>
<i>what that impacted.</i>

4
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:06,198
<i>Make sure it wasn't</i>
<i>one of your friendlies, Roger.</i>

5
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,271
<i>Red Hotel six,</i>
<i>this is Longhorn.</i>

6
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:13,472
<i>I see possible contact.</i>

7
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:20,112
<i>That was right where</i>
<i>they were making contact from,</i>

8
00:01:20,114 --> 00:01:22,648
<i>Red Hotel Tower.</i>

9
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,516
<i>There's an RPG</i>
<i>coming from the east.</i>

00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:30,456
<i>4-2-0,</i>
<i>this is 4-2 Charlie.</i>

11
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:32,157
- <i>Message over.</i>
<i>- 420:</i> <i>Send, over.</i>

12
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,794
<i>4-2 Charlie, are you aware</i>
<i>at grid 4-1?</i>

13
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:38,297
<i>...only thing that was</i>
<i>bad about it...</i>

14
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:39,665
<i>...I know...</i>

15
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:40,866
<i>...There's been</i>
<i>an ambush...</i>

16
00:01:44,205 --> 00:01:47,272
<i>Do you copy, over?</i>
<i>Sergeant Smith, do you copy?</i>

17
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:50,209
<i>4-2 Charlie contact involving</i>
<i>small arms fire on vehicle.</i>

18
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:51,844
<i>There are three guys</i>
<i>running out there at the back.</i>

19
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:58,717
<i>Yep, he's got</i>
<i>a weapon on the right.</i>

20
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,419
<i>Roger that.</i>
<i>Hummingbird can see it.</i>

21
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:02,554
<i>He's got a weapon.</i>

22
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:03,856
<i>He's still shooting</i>
<i>up in the air right now.</i>

23
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:04,890
<i>We see him.</i>

24
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:10,596
<i>Sergeant Smith, I have</i>
<i>good arcs on your position.</i>

25
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:12,564
<i>I believe he's British.</i>
<i>He's shooting.</i>

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,604

32
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:56,275
<i>Sorry, mate.</i>

33
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:17,229
Taxman!

34
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:20,265
<i>All we want is your cash</i>
<i>and your rocks.</i>

35
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:21,533
Joey, don't fight back.

36
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,914
<i>Run, Isabel!</i>

37
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,693
<i>Hi, this is Damon.</i>

38
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:36,261
<i>I won't be available</i>
<i>at this number</i>

39
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:37,829
<i>until October the first.</i>

40
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:39,964
<i>If you need me,</i>
<i>you can call my agent Paul</i>

41
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:42,267
<i>or reach me</i>
<i>on my New York number.</i>

<i>That's 212-555-9898.</i>

00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,481
<i>You have no new messages.</i>

45
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:13,324
<i>Anybody lost</i>
<i>or needs direction?</i>

46
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:17,862
<i>Anybody lost</i>
<i>or needs direction?</i>

47
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:20,865
<i>Anybody lost</i>
<i>or needs direction?</i>

48
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,402
Anybody lost or needs--

49
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:35,446
Oh!

50
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:36,548
Get off, get off!

51
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,949
Don't do it!

52
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:14,485
Happy birthday,
Cristina.

53
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:16,621
Actually, it was two days ago,
but thank you.

54
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:23,328
Happy birthday,
Cristina.

55
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,563
Actually, it was two days ago,
but thank you.

56
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:44,449
No alcohol.

57
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,925
I'm looking for someone.

58
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,301
Joseph, where did you
get those clothes?

59
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:06,905
Her name's Isabel.

60
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:08,673
They saw her.

61
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:10,541
I've come
to save her.

62
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:13,978
Joseph, did you
rob someone?

63
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,948
I had some luck.

64
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,616
Maybe God, you know?

65
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,420
God gave me this.

66
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,124
Joseph, I'm going
to call David,

67
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:29,594
my police
liaison officer.

68
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:35,133
This is
for you, sister.

69
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:37,402
You're okay.

70
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:40,638
Buy something nice
for yourself.

71
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:09,594
20, 40, 60, 80, 100.

72
00:17:09,596 --> 00:17:13,731
<i>20, 40, 60, 80, 200.</i>

73
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:17,402
<i>20, 40, 60, 80, 300.</i>

74
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:20,438
<i>20, 40, 60, 80, 400.</i>

75
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,607
<i>450, 500.</i>

76
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:25,209
Sister Cristina.

77
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,711
<i>So, do you know how much</i>
<i>is there?</i>

78
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,746
£500.

79
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:34,318
A donation
is a donation.

80
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,787
I don't see
the quandary.

81
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:37,255
<i>He's quite famous</i>
<i>among them.</i>

82
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:39,223
They say he was
a commando.

83
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,691
He killed people
in Afghanistan.

84
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:42,560
That's what
soldiers do.

85
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,462
It doesn't mean
he's a thief.

86
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:48,733
<i>Did he say where</i>
<i>he got the money from?</i>

87
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,201
He said,
"Maybe God."

88
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,809
Anyway, what do you think
the police themselves

89
00:17:57,811 --> 00:17:59,610
would do with it
if you handed it in?

90
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:02,113
<i>They'd just share it out</i>
<i>and drink it in the pub.</i>

91
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,751
or at Christmas,
get them all jumpers or something.

92
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:14,158
Actually, he told me
to buy something for myself.

93
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:22,200
I thought perhaps maybe
I could use

94
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:24,502
<i>just a small</i>
<i>proportion of it.</i>

95
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:27,638
You see, there is something
I have been praying for.

96
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,707
<i>You're a good and holy woman,</i>
<i>Sister Cristina.</i>

97
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,843
If the money's
an answer to a prayer,

98
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:33,478
<i>how can it be wrong?</i>

99
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:36,814
<i>Let me</i>
<i>put it this way.</i>

100
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:39,617
I've not written anything down
about this in the book.

101
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:07,879
One for Maria
Zielinska.

102
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:09,413
One what?

103
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:12,683
One for the Maria Zielinska
farewell performance.

104
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:14,785
I'm afraid
it's all sold out.

105
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:16,554
Sold out?

106
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:18,222
But it isn't
until October.

107
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:20,491
It sold out online
in two hours.

108
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,193
Online.

109
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:24,729
We do still have
one box available.

110
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:27,431
A box?

111
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:30,334
On Tuesday,
October first.

112
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,436
And how much
is a box?

113
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:36,707
A box for
the farewell performance

114
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:39,243
is £500.

115
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,722
Contact! Contact!

116
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:23,721
Contact!

117
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:15,039
<i>...Possible contact.</i>

118
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,841
<i>Hummingbird drone, over.</i>

119
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:22,313
<i>Yeah, he's got a weapon</i>
<i>on the right.</i>

120
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:24,048
<i>Hummingbird can see it.</i>
<i>He's got a weapon.</i>

121
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,451
<i>He's still shooting</i>
<i>up in the air right now.</i>

122
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,620
<i>We see him.</i>

123
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,656
<i>Can we just</i>
<i>cut the guy off?</i>

124
00:21:31,658 --> 00:21:32,890
<i>Do you copy?</i>

125
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:16,967
Sister.

126
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:19,003
I'm afraid you're
too late for soup.

127
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,472
I'm not hungry.

128
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:23,908
I need medicine.

129
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,109
You're hurt?

130
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:27,545
I need antibiotics.

131
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:29,847
I'm not allowed
to dispense antibiotics.

132
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:33,517
But you do it for people
who can't get into the system.

133
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,886
- <i>Go to emergency.</i>
<i>- I can't.</i>

134
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:38,723
Why not?
If you don't want to give your name,

135
00:22:38,725 --> 00:22:41,058
just call yourself
Smith or something.

136
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,693
That would be
a mistake.

137
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:45,129
- Why?
- My name <i>is</i> Smith.

138
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:46,997
Jones, then.

139
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:47,932
Sister...

140
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:52,536
I'm on the run
from a court-martial.

141
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,939
I was in
a Special Forces unit.

142
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:57,408
There'll be
no forgiveness.

143
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,847
How do you know
it's antibiotics you need?

144
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:04,448
I've got two broken ribs.

145
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,916
There's an infection
around one of the breaks.

146
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:07,518
If it spreads
to the bone, I'll die.

147
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:11,455
I've been
wounded before.

148
00:23:11,457 --> 00:23:13,657
If you drink alcohol
with these, they won't work.

149
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:15,459
I'll need
painkillers.

150
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:17,695
Give me something
with dihydrocodeine.

151
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:19,764
Yes, sir.

152
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:24,935
I've asked around
about your friend Isabel.

153
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:29,173
How'd you know
about Isabel?

154
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:31,809
Last night,
don't you remember?

155
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:33,577
Did I come here
last night?

156
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:36,046
Do something stupid?

157
00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:38,582
You said you'd
had some luck.

158
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:41,519
<i>"God," you said.</i>

159
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,157
You don't believe?

160
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:51,162
So how do you explain
those new clothes?

161
00:23:51,164 --> 00:23:52,897
I don't.

162
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,734
So what'd you find out
about Isabel?

163
00:23:56,736 --> 00:23:58,803
She doesn't come
for food anymore.

164
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:11,048
If you see her,
give her this.

165
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:14,151
Tell her she
can come to me.

166
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:16,620
Tell her
she can be safe.

167
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:19,757
- Who lives here?
- Me.

168
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:21,025
- Did you break in?
- I fell.

169
00:24:21,027 --> 00:24:22,726
Did you hurt someone?

170
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:24,728
Only myself.

171
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,674
Do you know the boys
say you're an angel?

172
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,510
Good night, Joseph.

173
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:06,103
<i>The solid sterling silver.</i>

174
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:08,606
<i>You've got lots of pieces</i>
<i>of solid sterling silver and, of course--</i>

175
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,974
<i>there we go--</i>
<i>you can see all of that</i>

176
00:25:09,976 --> 00:25:11,709
<i>from your hat pins</i>
<i>to your...</i>

177
00:25:11,711 --> 00:25:14,011
<i>uh-- to your--</i>
<i>shepherd's hook,</i>

178
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:16,714
<i>your-- your clasp,</i>
<i>your crimp beads,</i>

179
00:25:16,716 --> 00:25:18,649
<i>and six meters</i>
<i>of elastic,</i>

180
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:21,952
<i>one large</i>
<i>and one small gift pack.</i>

181
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:44,875
<i>...showers good.</i>

182
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:48,078
<i>40s, Cromarty,</i>
<i>Forth, Tyne, Dogger.</i>

183
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,014
<i>Easterly or northeasterly</i>

184
00:25:50,016 --> 00:25:51,582
<i>four or five,</i>
<i>occasionally...</i>

185
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:56,587
<i>...Bible tells us,</i>
<i>you know, in Gethsemane,</i>

186
00:25:56,589 --> 00:25:59,890
<i>talking to God and wanting</i>
<i>to not go through with this thing</i>

187
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,792
<i>and hesitating,</i>
<i>you know.</i>

188
00:26:01,794 --> 00:26:03,127
<i>And as all these</i>
<i>incredible things,</i>

189
00:26:03,129 --> 00:26:04,161
<i>Judas going</i>
<i>to the priests...</i>

190
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:53,777
<i>Joey, it's Isabel.</i>

191
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,980
<i>There's no need</i>
<i>to look for me. I'm okay.</i>

192
00:26:55,982 --> 00:26:57,615
<i>And I'll just</i>
<i>cause trouble.</i>

193
00:26:57,617 --> 00:26:59,216
<i>I've agreed to work for them</i>
<i>for a few weeks</i>

194
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:01,986
<i>until I've got enough</i>
<i>for a deposit on a nice place.</i>

195
00:27:01,988 --> 00:27:05,122
<i>Then I'll go back</i>
<i>up north.</i>

196
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:09,360
<i>and for thinkin' of me.</i>
<i>When I get away from London,</i>

197
00:27:09,362 --> 00:27:11,128
<i>I'll call you</i>
<i>if you're still there.</i>

198
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,230
<i>I've gotta go.</i>

199
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:24,842
<i>You have two messages.</i>

200
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,072
<i>I've agreed to work</i>
<i>for them for a few weeks</i>

201
00:27:55,074 --> 00:27:58,242
<i>until I've got enough</i>
<i>for a deposit on a nice place.</i>

202
00:27:58,244 --> 00:28:00,811
<i>Then I'll go back up north.</i>

203
00:28:00,813 --> 00:28:02,212
<i>Thanks for</i>
<i>looking after me, Joey,</i>

204
00:28:02,214 --> 00:28:03,847
<i>and for thinking of me.</i>

205
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:05,215
<i>When I get</i>
<i>away from London,</i>

206
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:06,884
<i>I'll call you</i>
<i>if you're still there.</i>

207
00:28:06,886 --> 00:28:08,752
<i>I've gotta go.</i>

208
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:13,857
<i>You have no more messages.</i>

209
00:29:24,163 --> 00:29:26,864
<i>'cause I saw you go in.</i>

210
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:31,168
<i>I'm gonna</i>
<i>call the police.</i>

211
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,075
Who are you?

212
00:29:38,077 --> 00:29:41,011
Damon said he was gonna be
in New York all summer.

213
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:43,914
I'm Damon's boyfriend.

214
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:45,349
One of 'em.

215
00:29:45,351 --> 00:29:48,886
<i>He said I could use his flat</i>
<i>while he was away.</i>

216
00:29:48,888 --> 00:29:50,287
Are you a model?

217
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,225
Sometimes.

218
00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:59,196
<i>He didn't say anyone</i>
<i>was gonna be staying.</i>

219
00:29:59,198 --> 00:30:00,564
Do you have his number
in New York?

220
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:05,035
No, he keeps
himself very private.

221
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:08,572
Pity, you could've
called him.

222
00:30:08,574 --> 00:30:10,040
Do you have a number?

223
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:13,844
He doesn't give it
to me.

224
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:15,179
In case I call him
late at night.

225
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:18,849
- I'm Tracy.
- Joey.

226
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:21,985
Joey Jones.

227
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,254
Damon said I should stay here
for the summer,

228
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,190
get my life
back together.

229
00:30:26,192 --> 00:30:28,959
So that's what
I'm gonna do.

230
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:34,431
Whew.

231
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:35,465
Fuck.

232
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:19,343
Joey, there's trouble.

233
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:56,413
Fucking dickhead's
trying to throw us out.

234
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,082
Is he fucking
following?

235
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:01,084
Dick, mate.

236
00:32:04,657 --> 00:32:07,024
- Here we go.
- It's Soho, I wanna see some tits.

237
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:08,392
It's late, boys.

238
00:32:08,394 --> 00:32:09,559
You're gonna
miss your train.

239
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:11,428
Who are you,
our fuckin' mum?

240
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,664
He thinks he is.
Fuck me if he ain't.

241
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:16,700
- Tits, mate.
- Fucking there's your tit.

242
00:32:16,702 --> 00:32:18,602
- That's right, mate.
- Here's your fucking tit, man.

243
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:22,039
Hey, don't fucking
touch my boy!

244
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:32,416
Fucking leave it, mate.

245
00:32:32,418 --> 00:32:35,619
He's a fucking soft,
southern fucking cunt.

246
00:32:37,556 --> 00:32:39,189
- Easy, pal.
- Fucking get off him.

247
00:32:39,191 --> 00:32:41,358
- You'll miss your train.
- I'll fucking have him!

248
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:47,331
<i>Fucking get him!</i>

249
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:00,978
Now you've missed
your train.

250
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:14,785
Huh?

251
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:28,532
- You wanna work?
- Yeah.

252
00:34:28,534 --> 00:34:31,234
You know what
kind of work I do.

253
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:34,304
They say you want
a driver.

254
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:37,207
I got a lot
of businesses.

255
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:42,312
They say you're
a hard man.

256
00:34:42,314 --> 00:34:43,814
It's a hard city.

257
00:34:58,831 --> 00:35:00,831
<i>Hold on!</i>

258
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:24,821
Can we play
the animal game?

259
00:35:24,823 --> 00:35:26,389
Go on, then.

260
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:29,593
- Um... has it got four legs?
- Yes.

261
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:31,795
All right,
has it got fur?

262
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:33,330
<i>Yes.</i>

263
00:35:33,332 --> 00:35:35,499
<i>Um, give me</i>
<i>another clue.</i>

264
00:35:35,501 --> 00:35:37,300
- <i>It's gray.</i>
<i>- Gray?</i>

265
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:38,468
Yeah.

266
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,170
- Is it a dog?
- No.

267
00:35:40,172 --> 00:35:43,173
<i>Um, could it eat me?</i>

268
00:35:43,175 --> 00:35:44,241
<i>Probably.</i>

269
00:35:44,243 --> 00:35:47,310
Right, so,
how many legs has it got?

270
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:49,546
- Two.
- You said four.

271
00:35:49,548 --> 00:35:51,314
<i>Are you tricking me?</i>

272
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:22,612
I hear he wants
to see me.

273
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:47,504
What the fuck?

274
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:49,406
New rules.

275
00:36:49,408 --> 00:36:51,608
No room service cards
anywhere between

276
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:52,842
Lisle Street
and The Crown.

277
00:36:52,844 --> 00:36:55,312
What the fuck
are you talking about?

278
00:36:55,314 --> 00:36:56,980
You're not even
a fucking Chink to be giving out rules.

279
00:36:56,982 --> 00:36:58,348
Show him.

280
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:11,628
New rules.

281
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:25,408
No.

282
00:37:51,403 --> 00:37:53,470
Can I help you?

283
00:37:53,472 --> 00:37:55,505
I've got a delivery
for the Angel of the Lord's Mission.

284
00:37:55,507 --> 00:37:59,009
<i>45 Margheritas,</i>
<i>45 garlic breads,</i>

285
00:37:59,011 --> 00:38:00,944
45 Coke Zeroes,

286
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:03,480
<i>45 chicken dippers,</i>
<i>and 45 coleslaws.</i>

287
00:38:03,482 --> 00:38:04,814
There must be
a mistake.

288
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:10,620
It's paid for
by Joey Jones.

289
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:13,023
Okay, it's not
a mistake.

290
00:38:13,025 --> 00:38:14,024
Who wants pizza?

291
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,012
<i>Tell your boss</i>
<i>in fifteen minutes</i>

292
00:38:36,014 --> 00:38:37,947
to have Mr. Choy's
envelope ready.

293
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:40,583
Also, I wanna order
takeaway for delivery.

294
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:43,353
It's very nice,
but I've no idea what it is.

295
00:38:43,355 --> 00:38:44,754
I think
it's probably duck.

296
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:46,923
And there's fish
and chicken and pancakes.

297
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:49,759
- And this is from Crazy Joe
the angel, yeah?
- Next?

298
00:38:58,337 --> 00:38:59,936
Just drive, man.
Just fucking drive.

299
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:10,647
That's his little sister.
She won't talk.

300
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:45,081
Dawn?

301
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:46,516
It's me.

302
00:39:46,518 --> 00:39:48,685
Joe.

303
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:56,593
Nice suit.

304
00:39:56,595 --> 00:39:58,428
Me and your daughter
live on £25 a week.

305
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,499
Since I lost my job, I've been
paying the landlord with blowjobs.

306
00:40:03,969 --> 00:40:07,670
What have you been doing
while they cut everything, Joey?

307
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:10,507
I've been fighting.

308
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:35,031
There's more
where this came from.

309
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:36,633
Lots more.

310
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:21,511
<i>You got my invitation.</i>

311
00:41:21,513 --> 00:41:23,513
Wasn't sure
you'd come.

312
00:41:23,515 --> 00:41:25,048
Buying food for the boys,
it's okay,

313
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:27,016
but not this.

314
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:31,988
Giving me things puts me
in a very difficult position.

315
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,491
You're not vegetarian, are ya?

316
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:38,895
Why are you lighting fires
on the pavement?

317
00:41:38,897 --> 00:41:40,930
My Chinese boss
sends his people here

318
00:41:40,932 --> 00:41:42,999
to buy meat
for his restaurants.

319
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:44,801
<i>I get three hours</i>
<i>hanging out on the street</i>

320
00:41:44,803 --> 00:41:46,769
doing nothing.

321
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,941
So tonight I decided
to have a barbecue.

322
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:53,877
<i>- You used to feed me.</i>

323
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:57,847
Tonight, I feed you.

324
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:04,854
This is a very strange
thing to be doing.

325
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:10,293
I miss the smell
of woodsmoke.

326
00:42:10,295 --> 00:42:13,563
I'm guessing that you have
psychological problems.

327
00:42:13,565 --> 00:42:16,065
They put me
up a mountain

328
00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:19,202
and told me
to kill people.

329
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:22,171
What'd they think would
come back down the mountain?

330
00:42:22,173 --> 00:42:24,941
Joseph, I came here
because I might have some news...

331
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:29,178
about Isabel.

332
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,648
<i>They found a girl.</i>

333
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:33,683
Last night,
my police liaison officer

334
00:42:33,685 --> 00:42:35,218
gave me
this photograph.

335
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:37,954
She was found
in the river.

336
00:42:37,956 --> 00:42:40,089
They need help
with identification.

337
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,692
She was from the north,
that's all I know.

338
00:43:15,694 --> 00:43:18,361
Did you love her?

339
00:43:18,363 --> 00:43:20,129
We shared a box.

340
00:43:20,131 --> 00:43:21,965
We'd just keep
each other warm.

341
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:27,904
Will you talk
to the police?

342
00:43:27,906 --> 00:43:29,172
Fuck the police.

343
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:39,782
Joseph, I'm really sorry
to bring such awful news.

344
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:42,185
Where in the river?

345
00:43:42,187 --> 00:43:44,220
The city, near
to Canary Wharf.

346
00:43:44,222 --> 00:43:46,356
One of those
rich guys.

347
00:43:46,358 --> 00:43:48,057
Yes, they think she
was killed by a client.

348
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:50,259
- The police give a shit?
- Of course they do.

349
00:43:50,261 --> 00:43:51,728
David is a good man.

350
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:54,697
Really?
He's a "good man."

351
00:43:54,699 --> 00:43:57,734
Good, good.
Good for him.

352
00:43:57,736 --> 00:43:59,369
- <i>Good.</i>

353
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:06,342
 In the fucking river!

354
00:44:06,344 --> 00:44:09,646
If you dare to be angry
about Isabel...

355
00:44:09,648 --> 00:44:10,913
<i>you're a hypocrite.</i>

356
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:14,017
<i>I've asked around</i>
<i>about your job</i>

357
00:44:14,019 --> 00:44:16,786
for the Chinese boss.

358
00:44:16,788 --> 00:44:18,988
They say, "Crazy Joey
deals drugs."

359
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:21,257
I just deliver the stuff.
I don't touch the stuff.

360
00:44:21,259 --> 00:44:25,728
The autopsy said Isabel
"touched the stuff."

361
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:28,731
Maybe stuff
you delivered.

362
00:44:28,733 --> 00:44:31,300
You don't put those things
together in your head.

363
00:44:31,302 --> 00:44:33,002
You know why she
ended up in the river?

364
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:35,672
Because that's what
the river's for.

365
00:44:35,674 --> 00:44:38,775
To wash away girls when
they're finished with them.

366
00:44:38,777 --> 00:44:41,711
I see what's happening
in this fucking city.

367
00:44:41,713 --> 00:44:42,945
<i>How many people</i>
<i>you feed these days, huh?</i>

368
00:44:42,947 --> 00:44:46,049
You give them soup.

369
00:44:46,051 --> 00:44:47,850
They want
their lives back!

370
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:20,817
Joey, when you were
out of your head on drugs

371
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:22,952
a few months ago,
you gave me some money.

372
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:27,757
I've spent it on
something for myself.

373
00:45:27,759 --> 00:45:30,493
I haven't been able
to sleep properly since.

374
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:33,930
I-- I called
my sister in Warsaw.

375
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:38,201
She sold some of
the possessions I left behind.

376
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:46,843
I don't need this.

377
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:52,915
I'm really sorry
about Isabel.

378
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:54,517
I know you
cared for her,

379
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:58,788
but think about
all the other Isabels.

380
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:03,292
Start to do
the right thing.

381
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:07,997
It is honest money.
I cleaned it for you.

382
00:46:07,999 --> 00:46:10,800
Use it to start
an honest life.

383
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,984
I want you
to have this.

384
00:46:30,854 --> 00:46:32,288
I'm gonna do a lot
of good things this summer.

385
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:34,557
Give people
what they want.

386
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:36,492
I thought you might
want a dress.

387
00:46:36,494 --> 00:46:38,861
Joey, I'm a nun.

388
00:46:38,863 --> 00:46:40,863
I used to wear
a uniform.

389
00:46:40,865 --> 00:46:43,032
Don't mean a thing,
you just take it off.

390
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:47,804
If it looks
beautiful on you,

391
00:46:47,806 --> 00:46:49,539
then God would say
it's okay, wouldn't He?

392
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:54,477
I will put it in the bag of clothes
for Africa.

393
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,555
<i>My guest this week</i>
<i>is Baroness Glennis Baker,</i>

394
00:47:05,557 --> 00:47:08,558
<i>a emeritus professor</i>
<i>of psychology.</i>

395
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,160
<i>She has specialized</i>
<i>in the health and welfare</i>

396
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:12,995
<i>of people with learning</i>
<i>disabilities,</i>

397
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:15,331
<i>advising on policies</i>
<i>and influencing...</i>

398
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:25,474
Fuck.

399
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:41,390
Yeah!

400
00:47:41,392 --> 00:47:44,193
Your cash
and your rocks, boys.

401
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:55,371
Don't remember me,
do you?

402
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:00,209
Not surprised.

403
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:01,477
I've changed.

404
00:48:04,649 --> 00:48:06,449
You've got a knife...

405
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,621
I've got a spoon.

406
00:48:19,129 --> 00:48:20,930
Who killed Isabel?

407
00:48:37,447 --> 00:48:40,283
Go on, Joey.
Show 'em. Show 'em!

408
00:48:57,168 --> 00:48:59,035
Who killed Isabel?

409
00:48:59,037 --> 00:49:01,003
I don't know.

410
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,977
You're only alive
because I need information.

411
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,414
An eye for an eye.

412
00:49:14,985 --> 00:49:16,719
You tell me
what happened to her,

413
00:49:16,721 --> 00:49:19,655
or I'll kill you
with this spoon.

414
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:24,360
Some guy used to
rent her regular.

415
00:49:24,362 --> 00:49:25,962
Beat her up.

416
00:49:25,964 --> 00:49:28,030
He used to ask
for her.

417
00:49:28,032 --> 00:49:30,132
He went too far.

418
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:31,667
Name.

419
00:49:31,669 --> 00:49:33,269
We don't use names.

420
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:36,639
Describe him to me.

421
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,576
- Ah!
- Describe him to me.

422
00:49:40,578 --> 00:49:44,013
He was about 30,
city boy,

423
00:49:44,015 --> 00:49:45,681
scar over his eye.

424
00:49:45,683 --> 00:49:47,350
That's all I know.

425
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:55,324
You get any trouble
from these two again,

426
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:57,259
you tell
Crazy Joe, okay?

427
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:19,108
Jesus.

428
00:51:30,654 --> 00:51:32,088
Fuck.

429
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:34,657
You look--

430
00:51:34,659 --> 00:51:36,092
Your note said
you had information

431
00:51:36,094 --> 00:51:38,427
for the police
about Isabel's killer.

432
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,396
That is the only reason
I am here.

433
00:51:40,398 --> 00:51:42,565
And I put on
this dress because

434
00:51:42,567 --> 00:51:44,100
it is the only dress
I have.

435
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:47,770
And don't think I won't
send it to Africa,

436
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:49,271
because I will.

437
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:53,709
They think my name's Damon,
by the way.

438
00:51:53,711 --> 00:51:55,377
Please don't remind me.

439
00:51:57,314 --> 00:51:59,782
- I think I might faint.
- What?

440
00:51:59,784 --> 00:52:01,817
I haven't eaten
anything all day...

441
00:52:01,819 --> 00:52:04,120
worrying whether
or not I would come.

442
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,460
Also, I didn't realize

443
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:12,695
there would be
so many naked men.

444
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:23,472
Look, I arranged
to meet you here

445
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:25,441
because I thought
you might like the photographs.

446
00:52:25,443 --> 00:52:26,775
I didn't realize
there'd be photographs

447
00:52:26,777 --> 00:52:28,644
of men's... penises.

448
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:31,413
Sorry.

449
00:52:31,415 --> 00:52:34,216
Joey, actually,
I do like photographs.

450
00:52:34,218 --> 00:52:37,386
I take photographs--
usually of nature.

451
00:52:37,388 --> 00:52:40,656
Penises are nature,
I suppose.

452
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:42,858
Yes, I suppose they are.

453
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,393
So what'd
you tell the mother?

454
00:52:44,395 --> 00:52:47,263
I lied, I lied,
I lied.

455
00:52:48,598 --> 00:52:50,766
So what information
do you have?

456
00:52:50,768 --> 00:52:53,636
Tell your policeman
to look for a guy around 30.

457
00:52:53,638 --> 00:52:55,638
He has a scar
above his eye.

458
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,439
Works in the city.

459
00:52:57,441 --> 00:52:59,408
Should I
write this down?

460
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:01,477
That's all I have.

461
00:53:01,479 --> 00:53:03,412
Okay...

462
00:53:03,414 --> 00:53:06,682
30 years old,
scar above his eye,

463
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:08,918
works in the city.
Got it.

464
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,886
We haven't been
introduced.

465
00:53:10,888 --> 00:53:12,755
I'm Karl.
What's your name?

466
00:53:14,824 --> 00:53:16,525
Just looking around.

467
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:19,762
I'm told the invitation
you handed in at the desk

468
00:53:19,764 --> 00:53:21,897
was addressed
to Damon Coldfield.

469
00:53:21,899 --> 00:53:24,300
I happen to be Damon's
photographic agent.

470
00:53:24,302 --> 00:53:25,501
He's in New York.

471
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,637
<i>Who the hell are you?</i>

472
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:47,256
I think you're
a bit drunk.

473
00:53:47,258 --> 00:53:48,757
Yes.

474
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:53,662
I'm having
a crazy patch.

475
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:57,266
Starting when
I bought the ticket.

476
00:53:58,635 --> 00:54:00,669
What ticket?

477
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:07,376
I used your money to buy
a ticket to a ballet.

478
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,451
That's a pretty
wicked thing to do.

479
00:54:22,827 --> 00:54:25,561
But, you see...

480
00:54:25,563 --> 00:54:27,630
I've loved her
since I was a little girl.

481
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:30,899
Loved who?

482
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:35,004
Maria Zielinska.

483
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:39,675
She's 42
and still dancing.

484
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:43,579
She is who I always
wanted to be.

485
00:54:45,315 --> 00:54:47,349
She is who
I should have been.

486
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,626
I'm in a silk dress
in an alleyway...

487
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:58,761
with a gangster.

488
00:54:58,763 --> 00:55:00,963
- Whoa!
- Oop!

489
00:55:00,965 --> 00:55:02,765
And I'm drunk.

490
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:08,470
Are you still a gangster, Joey,
or did I change you?

491
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:14,476
Just having
a crazy patch, too.

492
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:19,014
There are things
that I have to do.

493
00:55:19,016 --> 00:55:21,884
When the summer's over,
I'll stop.

494
00:55:21,886 --> 00:55:24,386
Because of me, yes?

495
00:55:24,388 --> 00:55:26,355
I have to think
I'm doing good.

496
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:30,726
Your excuse for wearing
a pretty dress.

497
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:38,067
When does Damon return?

498
00:55:39,803 --> 00:55:41,036
October the first.

499
00:55:41,038 --> 00:55:44,006
Then it's fate.

500
00:55:44,008 --> 00:55:46,575
What is?

501
00:55:46,577 --> 00:55:48,977
<i>When I say</i>
<i>it's fate...</i>

502
00:55:48,979 --> 00:55:52,448
I should really say
it's God, but I don't.

503
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:55,651
You know why?

504
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:01,490
Because I'm not so sure
that God is there anymore.

505
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,627
That's the truth.

506
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:15,437
I think I'm going
to throw up.

507
00:56:15,439 --> 00:56:17,740
Oh.

508
00:56:17,742 --> 00:56:19,408
No, I'm fine.

509
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:26,882
Sister,
I'm Catholic.

510
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:35,724
I'm not your sister.

511
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,762
I'm drunk and I'm
up against the wall.

512
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:13,629
30...

513
00:57:13,631 --> 00:57:16,131
a scar
above the eye...

514
00:57:16,133 --> 00:57:18,634
works in the city.

515
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:39,822
<i>A massive 50% off.</i>

516
00:57:39,824 --> 00:57:42,458
<i>Rain jackets</i>
<i>half price.</i>

517
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:45,727
Fleece half price,
T-shirts half price.

518
00:57:45,729 --> 00:57:47,963
<i>Walking shoes</i>
<i>half price.</i>

519
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:49,932
- <i>A massive 50% off.</i>

520
00:57:53,102 --> 00:57:54,803
Joey...

521
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:56,972
H-how are things?

522
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:58,507
Things are okay.

523
00:57:58,509 --> 00:58:00,209
Have you heard
from Damon?

524
00:58:00,211 --> 00:58:01,643
Yeah, he's okay.

525
00:58:01,645 --> 00:58:02,911
You seem
so together now.

526
00:58:02,913 --> 00:58:04,646
I'm really
together now.

527
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:07,216
You're like
a different person.

528
00:58:07,218 --> 00:58:09,818
So, Joey...

529
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:12,721
are you
exclusively gay?

530
00:58:12,723 --> 00:58:15,491
You know,
it's interesting...

531
00:58:15,493 --> 00:58:17,626
recently...

532
00:58:17,628 --> 00:58:19,261
I've found myself
attracted to...

533
00:58:20,697 --> 00:58:22,097
nuns.

534
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:50,058
Who the fuck are you?

535
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:53,128
You owe
Mr. Choy money.

536
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:55,664
What the fuck do you know
about Mr. Choy?

537
00:58:55,666 --> 00:58:57,199
<i>He's my boss.</i>

538
00:58:57,201 --> 00:58:58,700
What are you
talking about?

539
00:58:58,702 --> 00:59:01,136
Mr. Choy only
employ Chinese.

540
00:59:01,138 --> 00:59:03,238
Tell Mr. Choy
I'll send him a check.

541
00:59:05,142 --> 00:59:06,675
I'm taking the cash.

542
00:59:12,782 --> 00:59:14,950
Give me
the fucking cash.

543
00:59:16,587 --> 00:59:18,720
Step out of the way,
my friend,

544
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:21,623
and let me take
some of what you owe in cash

545
00:59:21,625 --> 00:59:24,026
as a gesture
of goodwill.

546
00:59:24,028 --> 00:59:26,628
No!

547
00:59:43,146 --> 00:59:45,314
<i>Please don't hurt him!</i>

548
01:00:03,232 --> 01:00:05,367
That money belongs
to my family.

549
01:00:05,369 --> 01:00:07,002
<i>Vincenzo, no!</i>

550
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:29,057
<i>...of Mamarita Restaurant.</i>

551
01:00:29,059 --> 01:00:31,226
<i>18 Clancey Street.</i>
<i>That's 1-8 Clancey Street.</i>

552
01:00:31,228 --> 01:00:32,894
<i>...known by the name of</i>
<i>Joey Jones.</i>

553
01:00:32,896 --> 01:00:36,164
<i>No known address.</i>
<i>Approach with caution.</i>

554
01:00:36,166 --> 01:00:37,899
<i>Reported connection to the</i>
<i>Angel of the Lord</i>

555
01:00:37,901 --> 01:00:39,101
<i>Homeless Mission,</i>
<i>Covent Garden.</i>

556
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:51,980
Is there a problem?
You are scaring my clients.

557
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:54,316
We're looking
for someone.

558
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:56,385
<i>Calls himself</i>
<i>Joey Jones.</i>

559
01:00:58,656 --> 01:01:00,389
We've been told
he used to come down here.

560
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,926
<i>They said you'd know</i>
<i>where to find him.</i>

561
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:22,044
Let me help ya.

562
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:25,747
What are you
doing here?

563
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:37,826
I just lied
to the police.

564
01:01:37,828 --> 01:01:40,128
You haven't
changed at all.

565
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:42,097
If I could do something else,
I would do it.

566
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:45,300
What did
the policeman say

567
01:01:45,302 --> 01:01:47,836
when you gave him
the description?

568
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:51,940
He laughed at me.

569
01:01:51,942 --> 01:01:53,842
He said it was
"too vague."

570
01:01:53,844 --> 01:01:55,944
He said, "Tell
Joey Jones to come

571
01:01:55,946 --> 01:01:57,979
and speak
to us himself."

572
01:01:57,981 --> 01:01:59,981
You mean they can't be bothered
to fucking look

573
01:01:59,983 --> 01:02:02,150
'cause she was
a whore.

574
01:02:02,152 --> 01:02:05,287
The truth is...

575
01:02:05,289 --> 01:02:06,888
the police
are more interested

576
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:08,090
in finding out
more about <i>you.</i>

577
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:11,359
You're becoming
famous, Joey.

578
01:02:11,361 --> 01:02:13,028
<i>And Isabel</i>
<i>isn't famous?</i>

579
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,932
You really are
a hypocrite.

580
01:02:16,934 --> 01:02:21,269
You beat Taxman so bad
he's still in hospital.

581
01:02:21,271 --> 01:02:23,038
You're not
just an angel,

582
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:26,508
you're God Almighty
dispensing justice.

583
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:29,177
<i>Yeah, well,</i>
<i>I believe in justice.</i>

584
01:02:29,179 --> 01:02:31,780
Sometimes you have to
make it happen yourself.

585
01:02:33,382 --> 01:02:34,816
I'm not the only
hypocrite here.

586
01:02:37,186 --> 01:02:38,487
Want a kiss?

587
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:56,338
- Sorry.
- Get out of my car.

588
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:57,539
It's a van.

589
01:03:03,312 --> 01:03:05,947
I suppose you think it was
very funny that I got drunk.

590
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:08,784
I've been drunk myself
on occasion.

591
01:03:08,786 --> 01:03:10,519
What exactly happened?

592
01:03:10,521 --> 01:03:11,920
You don't remember?

593
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:15,557
It's all a blur.

594
01:03:15,559 --> 01:03:17,959
You asked me to kiss you,
so I kissed you.

595
01:03:23,867 --> 01:03:26,234
You didn't have
to kiss me

596
01:03:26,236 --> 01:03:28,870
just because
I asked.

597
01:03:28,872 --> 01:03:31,072
I wanted to.

598
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:42,584
Why did you want to?

599
01:03:42,586 --> 01:03:44,486
That's a really
stupid question.

600
01:03:47,256 --> 01:03:48,523
Look in the mirror.

601
01:03:50,226 --> 01:03:52,360
It's not my fault
that I'm fucked up.

602
01:03:52,362 --> 01:03:54,963
For a nun, your language
is pretty bad.

603
01:03:59,235 --> 01:04:01,169
So whose fault is it?

604
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:24,192
He was my
gymnastics instructor.

605
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:31,600
It was in Warsaw.

606
01:04:36,906 --> 01:04:39,541
It was my father
who made me do gymnastics.

607
01:04:39,543 --> 01:04:44,346
I wanted to be
a ballerina,

608
01:04:44,348 --> 01:04:46,114
but he said no.

609
01:04:57,027 --> 01:05:00,528
<i>If I had become</i>
<i>a ballerina,</i>

610
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:01,663
<i>it wouldn't</i>
<i>have happened.</i>

611
01:05:11,474 --> 01:05:13,575
My instructor
began to...

612
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:25,020
He began to do it
when I was 10 years old.

613
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:34,362
He did it 17 times.

614
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,035
<i>It was going to be</i>
<i>the 18th time.</i>

615
01:05:54,216 --> 01:05:56,952
For a very long time,
I believed I belonged in hell.

616
01:06:00,156 --> 01:06:01,690
Because I was
so young...

617
01:06:03,659 --> 01:06:06,461
they decided not
to send me to prison.

618
01:06:12,668 --> 01:06:15,337
Instead, they sent me
to a convent.

619
01:06:25,448 --> 01:06:26,715
Joey, I...

620
01:06:31,687 --> 01:06:34,556
I have never told this
to anyone before.

621
01:06:42,698 --> 01:06:44,332
Want me to drive?

622
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:47,168
I want someone
to drive.

623
01:07:03,152 --> 01:07:04,586
<i>Here will be fine.</i>

624
01:07:15,132 --> 01:07:16,631
How will you
get home?

625
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:22,637
I'm a gangster.
I'll steal a car.

626
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:32,647
I'll walk.

627
01:07:32,649 --> 01:07:34,816
It's a lovely
morning.

628
01:07:39,688 --> 01:07:42,123
Cristina,
in the end,

629
01:07:42,125 --> 01:07:44,559
I just took off
my uniform and ran.

630
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:50,098
And look
what happened to you.

631
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:05,380
Sister Cristina,
I am deeply shocked.

632
01:08:07,216 --> 01:08:09,617
You filled in
the Africa application.

633
01:08:09,619 --> 01:08:12,487
My preference is for the
Valley Mission in Sierra Leone.

634
01:08:12,489 --> 01:08:14,322
But what about
your work here

635
01:08:14,324 --> 01:08:15,590
at the Soho Mission?

636
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:18,560
Africa was always
part of my life plan.

637
01:08:18,562 --> 01:08:20,762
Yes, in two years.

638
01:08:20,764 --> 01:08:23,264
I want permission
to move it forward.

639
01:08:23,266 --> 01:08:26,568
<i>But why?</i>

640
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:29,404
I am finding there are too many
distractions here in London.

641
01:08:31,474 --> 01:08:33,208
You're blushing.

642
01:08:33,210 --> 01:08:35,110
It's very warm
in here.

643
01:08:35,112 --> 01:08:36,611
It's even warmer
in Sierra Leone.

644
01:08:36,613 --> 01:08:38,446
Hot, even.

645
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:41,182
I will wear a hat.

646
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:50,158
You have applied
to leave in this quarter.

647
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:53,294
I am ready to leave any time
after October the first.

648
01:09:04,273 --> 01:09:08,443
Joey, they said you wanted
to speak to the boss.

649
01:09:11,914 --> 01:09:13,348
Come with me.

650
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:22,757
Sit.

651
01:09:28,864 --> 01:09:30,431
Madame, you know
everything that happens

652
01:09:30,433 --> 01:09:31,833
in your back garden.

653
01:09:33,637 --> 01:09:36,671
If a man pays for girls
and he's violent,

654
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:38,640
he soon becomes famous.

655
01:09:47,616 --> 01:09:49,551
We refuse to deal
with them.

656
01:09:49,553 --> 01:09:51,920
<i>The Russians will</i>
<i>just charge double.</i>

657
01:09:51,922 --> 01:09:54,722
I understand you have
a blacklist of violent men.

658
01:09:59,228 --> 01:10:00,528
<i>I'm looking</i>
<i>for a very violent man</i>

659
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,730
who attacks girls.

660
01:10:05,234 --> 01:10:07,669
He's young.
Around 30.

661
01:10:09,405 --> 01:10:11,439
And he has a scar
above his eye.

662
01:10:15,911 --> 01:10:18,279
He wears
very expensive suits.

663
01:10:18,281 --> 01:10:19,681
We know him.

664
01:10:19,683 --> 01:10:22,884
The description
is not too vague for you?

665
01:10:22,886 --> 01:10:24,419
We have a business
to protect.

666
01:10:24,421 --> 01:10:26,487
Madame,
would you be able to

667
01:10:26,489 --> 01:10:27,522
find out the name
of this man?

668
01:10:39,935 --> 01:10:41,302
Hmm.

669
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:49,744
A favor for a favor.

670
01:13:51,693 --> 01:13:54,195
- Did they tell you?
- Tell me what?

671
01:13:56,965 --> 01:13:58,833
They didn't
tell you.

672
01:14:03,739 --> 01:14:07,208
No, no, stop!

673
01:14:07,210 --> 01:14:08,976
- Ah!
- They didn't tell you.

674
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:39,073
Stop.

675
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:19,947
58.

676
01:15:21,216 --> 01:15:23,751
Some of them
are kids.

677
01:15:23,753 --> 01:15:25,786
And some of them are girls.
You want one?

678
01:15:28,924 --> 01:15:31,926
I also asked
for information.

679
01:15:31,928 --> 01:15:34,161
It's coming, okay?

680
01:16:58,847 --> 01:17:00,848
It's the latest.
Do you know how to work it?

681
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:02,183
Yes, of course.

682
01:17:02,185 --> 01:17:06,153
You could afford to get
a professional to do this.

683
01:17:06,155 --> 01:17:08,322
Yeah, but I wanted you.

684
01:17:14,396 --> 01:17:15,997
So who are
the photographs for?

685
01:17:15,999 --> 01:17:18,232
My daughter.

686
01:17:18,234 --> 01:17:20,101
You have a daughter?

687
01:17:20,103 --> 01:17:21,702
Nine years old.

688
01:17:24,673 --> 01:17:26,307
I came here with her once
when she was small.

689
01:17:26,309 --> 01:17:28,409
<i>She might remember.</i>

690
01:17:28,411 --> 01:17:29,644
I want her to have
some photographs of me

691
01:17:29,646 --> 01:17:31,145
looking like
a normal man.

692
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:35,883
What do you think?

693
01:17:36,952 --> 01:17:39,120
Like this?

694
01:17:40,757 --> 01:17:41,822
Smile.

695
01:17:41,824 --> 01:17:45,326
Why?

696
01:17:45,328 --> 01:17:47,662
Okay, actually,
you look okay.

697
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:51,265
Do I look like
a good man?

698
01:17:52,801 --> 01:17:54,335
What do you mean?

699
01:17:55,971 --> 01:17:58,039
I want her to think
I'm a good man.

700
01:17:59,374 --> 01:18:02,076
Yes, you look like
a good man.

701
01:18:02,078 --> 01:18:04,178
So take a picture.

702
01:18:08,717 --> 01:18:10,918
Did your daughter
ask for photos?

703
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:12,887
<i>No, but</i>
<i>when she's older,</i>

704
01:18:12,889 --> 01:18:15,189
I want her to have something
to remind her of me.

705
01:18:15,191 --> 01:18:16,857
You won't see her?

706
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:20,094
I don't think I'll look
like this for much longer.

707
01:18:24,399 --> 01:18:26,767
Why not?

708
01:18:26,769 --> 01:18:28,736
Why shouldn't you
stay like this?

709
01:18:28,738 --> 01:18:30,738
Just take a picture.

710
01:18:38,413 --> 01:18:39,313
You should have
one like this.

711
01:18:39,315 --> 01:18:41,082
More natural.

712
01:18:41,084 --> 01:18:43,751
The businessman drinking
his morning coffee.

713
01:18:43,753 --> 01:18:45,119
Such a successful man.

714
01:18:45,121 --> 01:18:46,420
So rich.

715
01:18:46,422 --> 01:18:48,756
- Charitable.
- <i>Of course.</i>

716
01:18:48,758 --> 01:18:51,058
She will be
very proud of you.

717
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:52,193
Enough.

718
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:56,197
I said enough.

719
01:18:59,267 --> 01:19:00,901
At last a laugh.

720
01:19:04,139 --> 01:19:06,907
There.
I am changing you.

721
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:14,148
Send those ones to me.

722
01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:15,950
I'll take them with me
to Africa.

723
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:24,458
You're going to Africa?

724
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:27,294
A valley in Sierra Leone
where there is no water.

725
01:19:27,296 --> 01:19:30,064
When do you leave?

726
01:19:30,066 --> 01:19:31,932
Tomorrow.

727
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,442
So this is the end
of my crazy patch, Joey.

728
01:19:44,045 --> 01:19:46,914
And I've decided
I want to end it with you.

729
01:20:20,515 --> 01:20:22,817
<i>Sport coats, shorts...</i>

730
01:20:22,819 --> 01:20:26,053
half price.
T-shirts half price.

731
01:20:26,055 --> 01:20:28,422
<i>I've got rain jackets</i>
<i>half price.</i>

732
01:20:28,424 --> 01:20:30,491
<i>Fleece half price.</i>

733
01:20:30,493 --> 01:20:34,261
<i>Walking boots half price.</i>
<i>Trousers, half price.</i>

734
01:20:34,263 --> 01:20:35,462
Keep the change.

735
01:20:35,464 --> 01:20:38,299
...half price.
A massive 50...

736
01:20:38,301 --> 01:20:43,070
<i>...half price.</i>
<i>Rain jackets half price.</i>

737
01:20:57,619 --> 01:20:59,420
Hello?
Who's there?

738
01:21:01,123 --> 01:21:04,091
<i>- Hello?</i>

739
01:21:07,462 --> 01:21:09,096
<i>Cristina!</i>

740
01:21:15,637 --> 01:21:19,039
Who the bloody
hell are you?

741
01:21:22,011 --> 01:21:25,880
I don't know who you are,
but open this door.

742
01:21:32,521 --> 01:21:35,656
<i>Did you hear me?</i>
<i>I said open the door.</i>

743
01:21:46,434 --> 01:21:49,503
Cristina.

744
01:21:49,505 --> 01:21:52,940
There's enough money in here
to get us away.

745
01:21:52,942 --> 01:21:54,074
We could go anywhere
in the world.

746
01:21:54,076 --> 01:21:55,009
No, Joey...

747
01:21:57,679 --> 01:22:00,014
if you want to be
a good man,

748
01:22:00,016 --> 01:22:02,116
be a good man.

749
01:22:09,324 --> 01:22:12,993
Joey, will you come with me
to the ballet tonight?

750
01:22:12,995 --> 01:22:16,397
I have a box.
There is room for two.

751
01:22:16,399 --> 01:22:18,232
Tonight at 7:00.

752
01:22:34,549 --> 01:22:36,250
<i>My time here</i>
<i>at this mission</i>

753
01:22:36,252 --> 01:22:38,285
<i>has been</i>
<i>a fulfilling time.</i>

754
01:22:38,287 --> 01:22:40,287
<i>Surprises</i>
<i>all along the way.</i>

755
01:22:40,289 --> 01:22:43,991
Our mission has had
some failures.

756
01:22:43,993 --> 01:22:47,127
Some tragedies...

757
01:22:47,129 --> 01:22:49,496
the poor girl Isabel.

758
01:22:49,498 --> 01:22:51,565
But we have also
had successes.

759
01:22:51,567 --> 01:22:54,301
And we have also
had some who,

760
01:22:54,303 --> 01:22:57,171
<i>in spite of how</i>
<i>it may appear,</i>

761
01:22:57,173 --> 01:22:59,306
<i>give us</i>
<i>reason to hope.</i>

762
01:23:17,125 --> 01:23:18,726
Who are you?

763
01:23:18,728 --> 01:23:21,528
I've got something
for your mother.

764
01:23:27,135 --> 01:23:28,469
And something
for you.

765
01:23:39,581 --> 01:23:41,281
Can I just hold your hand
for a minute?

766
01:23:54,129 --> 01:23:55,496
<i>Ruby, who is it?</i>

767
01:24:06,074 --> 01:24:08,342
You be good, okay?

768
01:24:25,326 --> 01:24:27,528
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

769
01:24:27,530 --> 01:24:31,298
<i>and the farewell performance</i>
<i>of Maria Zielinska.</i>

770
01:25:20,448 --> 01:25:23,117
<i>Tonight's performance</i>
<i>will begin in five minutes.</i>

771
01:25:23,119 --> 01:25:25,119
<i>Please take your seats.</i>

772
01:25:27,589 --> 01:25:29,690
<i>Closing doors.</i>

773
01:25:52,547 --> 01:25:54,381
Absolutely, no.

774
01:26:03,659 --> 01:26:08,662
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>Maria Zielinska.</i>

775
01:26:50,438 --> 01:26:51,972
Max?

776
01:26:51,974 --> 01:26:53,507
Max Forrester?

777
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:56,610
Yes.
Who are you?

778
01:26:56,612 --> 01:26:58,912
How was your bonus
this year? Was it good?

779
01:26:58,914 --> 01:27:01,648
It was very good.

780
01:27:01,650 --> 01:27:03,417
Are you from Cisco
or American Eagle?

781
01:27:03,419 --> 01:27:05,919
No. I'm from down there.

782
01:27:07,655 --> 01:27:10,357
Listen, can I talk to you
for a minute?

783
01:27:10,359 --> 01:27:12,759
I was actually
just getting some drinks.

784
01:27:12,761 --> 01:27:14,394
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

785
01:27:14,396 --> 01:27:16,530
Let me think...

786
01:27:16,532 --> 01:27:18,298
<i>- Oof!</i>

787
01:27:22,704 --> 01:27:24,905
What the--
what the hell do you want?

788
01:27:24,907 --> 01:27:26,740
I think you should know
how it feels to be down there.

789
01:27:26,742 --> 01:27:28,442
What?

790
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:47,427
<i>A reported fatality.</i>
<i>Paramedics are on the scene.</i>

791
01:27:47,429 --> 01:27:50,264
<i>Witnesses report he was pushed</i>
<i>or thrown from the roof.</i>

792
01:27:50,266 --> 01:27:53,700
<i>Military Police</i>
<i>reference blotter AR630.</i>

793
01:27:53,702 --> 01:27:56,970
<i>Surveillance footage matches</i>
<i>visual of Joseph Smith.</i>

794
01:27:56,972 --> 01:27:59,506
<i>Department of Defense,</i>
<i>long-term missing person.</i>

795
01:27:59,508 --> 01:28:02,042
-  <i>Do you have a visual?</i>
<i>Negative, no further sightings.</i>

796
01:29:33,468 --> 01:29:34,901
What are you doing here?

797
01:29:37,105 --> 01:29:39,039
I'm waiting
for Maria Zielinska.

798
01:29:41,576 --> 01:29:42,843
There was a party
after the show.

799
01:29:42,845 --> 01:29:44,010
I want to see her
walk to her car.

800
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:06,833
Let me explain.

801
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:14,908
When I'm sober...

802
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:19,679
when I'm healthy
and well...

803
01:30:23,818 --> 01:30:25,519
I hurt people.

804
01:30:27,655 --> 01:30:29,623
<i>I'm lethal.</i>

805
01:30:31,659 --> 01:30:34,194
I drink to weaken
the machine they made.

806
01:30:38,032 --> 01:30:40,734
I've finished the work
I had to do.

807
01:30:55,183 --> 01:30:57,517
And already, look.

808
01:31:00,822 --> 01:31:01,922
You see 'em?

809
01:31:04,892 --> 01:31:06,960
Hummingbirds.

810
01:31:15,903 --> 01:31:18,939
Hummingbirds were there
that day.

811
01:31:20,843 --> 01:31:23,677
<i>Do you copy?</i>

812
01:31:23,679 --> 01:31:27,514
Surveillance drones
saw what happened.

813
01:31:27,516 --> 01:31:29,149
<i>Roger that.</i>
<i>Hummingbird can see it.</i>

814
01:31:29,151 --> 01:31:30,851
<i>He's got a weapon...</i>

815
01:31:30,853 --> 01:31:33,553
<i>He's shooting up</i>
<i>in the air right now..</i>

816
01:31:41,095 --> 01:31:42,829
Please, please!

817
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:54,841
The enemy killed
five of ours...

818
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:04,651
so I killed
five of theirs.

819
01:32:07,989 --> 01:32:10,156
<i>The first five</i>
<i>I could find.</i>

820
01:32:15,096 --> 01:32:17,864
I left the father
hanging.

821
01:33:10,351 --> 01:33:11,918
You see her?

822
01:33:14,689 --> 01:33:16,890
She is my witness.

823
01:34:04,205 --> 01:34:05,839
Sister.

824
01:34:25,726 --> 01:34:27,894
<i>"Dear Cristina,</i>

825
01:34:27,896 --> 01:34:31,665
<i>I just wanted to say thank you</i>
<i>for taking the photographs.</i>

826
01:34:31,667 --> 01:34:32,899
<i>Considering it's me</i>
<i>in the pictures,</i>

827
01:34:32,901 --> 01:34:36,269
<i>they turned out</i>
<i>pretty well.</i>

828
01:34:36,271 --> 01:34:38,371
<i>I gave all the best ones</i>
<i>to my daughter,</i>

829
01:34:38,373 --> 01:34:40,040
<i>so you're left</i>
<i>with the ugly ones</i>

830
01:34:40,042 --> 01:34:42,809
<i>and the scary ones.</i>
<i>Sorry.</i>

831
01:34:44,845 --> 01:34:46,746
<i>I've sent Damon the money</i>
<i>I took from his account</i>

832
01:34:46,748 --> 01:34:48,715
<i>and added some extra</i>
<i>for rent.</i>

833
01:34:50,751 --> 01:34:54,087
<i>I left the boys at the mission</i>
<i>some cash for pizzas.</i>

834
01:34:54,089 --> 01:34:56,056
<i>And I sent details</i>
<i>of the people smugglers</i>

835
01:34:56,058 --> 01:34:59,292
<i>to the police.</i>

836
01:34:59,294 --> 01:35:01,828
<i>I also rid the city</i>
<i>of a bad man.</i>

837
01:35:01,830 --> 01:35:04,164
<i>I know that doesn't</i>
<i>make me a good man,</i>

838
01:35:04,166 --> 01:35:06,466
<i>but I tried to do</i>
<i>the right thing.</i>

839
01:35:10,805 --> 01:35:13,440
<i>Now I'll go back to the street</i>
<i>and disappear.</i>

840
01:35:13,442 --> 01:35:16,843
<i>I was alive again</i>
<i>for one summer.</i>

841
01:35:16,845 --> 01:35:18,311
<i>I'm glad I spent it</i>
<i>with you.</i>

842
01:35:20,448 --> 01:35:22,382
<i>I hope Africa</i>
<i>treats you well.</i>

843
01:35:22,384 --> 01:35:25,151
<i>All my love,</i>
<i>Joseph Smith."</i>

844
01:35:27,222 --> 01:35:31,991
<i>Surveillance camera profile</i>
<i>matched to Joseph Smith.</i>

845
01:35:31,993 --> 01:35:35,161
<i>Target heading eastbound</i>
<i>on Brewer Street</i>

846
01:35:35,163 --> 01:35:36,362
<i>towards</i>
<i>Glasshouse Street.</i>

847
01:35:36,364 --> 01:35:38,198
<i>Absent without leave.</i>

848
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:40,400
<i>File zero-four-zero</i>
<i>for profile and visual.</i>

849
01:35:40,402 --> 01:35:42,402
<i>I repeat that's east--</i>
<i>east on Brewer Street.</i>

850
01:35:42,404 --> 01:35:44,871
<i>...matches visual</i>
<i>of Joseph Smith.</i>

851
01:35:44,873 --> 01:35:46,439
<i>Approach with</i>
<i>extreme caution.</i>

852
01:35:46,441 --> 01:35:47,807
<i>I think we have him.</i>

853
01:35:47,809 --> 01:35:49,142
<i>Okay, target in sight. Go.</i>

854
01:35:49,144 --> 01:35:50,276
<i>Yeah, we got him.</i>
<i>Take him.</i>
