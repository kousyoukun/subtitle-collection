1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,989
Czech National Archives present

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,517
Valerie and Her Week of Wonders

3
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,832
Music

4
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,120
Who's there?

5
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,954
Weasel!

6
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:17,275
Valerie, forgive me...

7
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,749
What did you do with her earrings?
Speak!

8
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,915
- I lost them, Constable.
- You'll not escape punishment.

9
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,674
It's the water torture for you.

10
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,758
- Eagle!
- Bend over!

11
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,235
I'm going to jump on your back.

12
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,914
Hurry up, you guttersnipe!

13
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,831
Grandmother, the actors have come.

14
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,235
You should care more
about the missionaries coming.

15
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,319
- When?
- Today or tomorrow.

16
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,908
One of them will stay with us.

17
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,033
Playing with your earrings again, child?

18
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,312
I'm no longer a child, Grandmother.

19
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,394
Last night, I...

20
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,310
At the age of 13,
just like your mother.

21
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,759
I warn you...

22
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,390
Get rid of those earrings.

23
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,595
Your mother put them away
the day she entered the convent.

24
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,669
Your father was a bishop.
Now they are both in heaven.

25
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,595
Is there something secret
about these earrings?

26
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:23,591
No. I got them from a constable
when they auctioned this house.

27
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,234
You knew him?

28
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,556
Grandmother,
the actors are here!

29
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,316
No, that's a wedding.

30
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,479
Hedvika is getting married.

31
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,870
Lord, have mercy on her...
Poor Hedvika.

32
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,958
Why?
She's marrying a rich farmer.

33
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,397
Grandmother, a monster!

34
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,991
It can't be him. He died.

35
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,950
Who are you talking about?

36
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,872
Go and practise your minor scales.

37
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,676
Yes, Grandmother.

38
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:45,638
Beautiful maiden,
it was I who stole your earrings,

39
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,395
and who returned them to you.

40
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,718
My uncle, the constable
wants to get his hands on them.

41
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,756
He killed my father and mother,
and I fear for your life,

42
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,036
At church today...

43
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,516
At church today,
there's a sermon for virgins.

44
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,148
Leave me a dress in the gazebo

45
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,949
so I can speak to you
for a moment in disguise.

46
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,516
Yours, unhappy Eagle.

47
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,790
Valerie!

48
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,835
Valerie!

49
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,709
Where are you, child? Valerie!

50
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,638
It's time to dress for church.

51
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,509
Grandmother, may I bring
a sprig of rosemary?

52
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:31,033
I, a servant of God,
a missionary,

53
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,397
have come unto your maidens
to instruct you.

54
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:41,829
Oh, virgin,
do you know what you are?

55
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,154
You are the touch of an
alabaster hand.

56
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:51,550
A still unsplit pomegranate.

57
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,309
The hollow of a petal
of a blossoming rose.

58
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,674
The rude hand
that touches your breast

59
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,276
will leave an ineffaceable mark.

60
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,275
But I am here with you, my lady.

61
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,479
I bow before you
in place of your guardian angel.

62
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,217
With the most exquisite oil, I anoint

63
00:15:25,218 --> 00:15:29,074
your mouth, your breast, your womb.

64
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,836
Amen.

65
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,115
Eagle...

66
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,314
Eagle!

67
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,590
Eagle.

68
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,679
Eagle!

69
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,671
Valerie, is it you?

70
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,918
That monster tortured me.

71
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,191
Valerie, I want to give you some advice.

72
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,474
- We're on the square.
- Forgive me, don't look.

73
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,876
- Now?
- Yes.

74
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,150
I'm up here.
Well, first of all...

75
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,070
Where's the local poorhouse,
my dear child?

76
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,519
There, Reverend Father.

77
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,152
You are performing an act of charity.

78
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,519
- Do you mind helping me?
- Not at all, Reverend Father.

79
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,558
Oh God, please...

80
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,152
You go first.

81
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,189
Go on, don't be afraid.

82
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,791
Do come in...

83
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,478
This is my kingdom.

84
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,076
Valerie!

85
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,789
Come...

86
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,119
Closer...

87
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,390
Come... and see.

88
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,393
Look.

89
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,793
No!

90
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:13,792
I know I no longer please you, Gracian.

91
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,871
When you were last here
five years ago...

92
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,476
But now...

93
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,197
Be gone.

94
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,433
- I'll whip myself.
- Grandmother!

95
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,591
Watch!

96
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,395
It's just a dream...

97
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,998
I'm sleeping...
I'm dreaming it all...

98
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,954
- Did he hurt you?
- No.

99
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,070
He wants you to love him.

100
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,070
How could I when I'm afraid of him?

101
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,353
For that very reason.

102
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,314
Eagle!

103
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,956
- Ready and waiting, constable!
- Damned schemer!

104
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,758
Hands up, thief or I'll shoot!

105
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,830
Elsa, it's me.

106
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,150
Don't you recognise me?

107
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,751
Richard...

108
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,953
How long it's been since
anyone's called me by that name.

109
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,473
Why did you come, Richard?

110
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,035
I missed you.

111
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,955
Since you seduced me then left me...

112
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,715
I've never loved another man.

113
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,952
Oh, I'm so sorry.

114
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,996
How old you are, Elsa.
You were 17 then.

115
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,754
What I wouldn't give
to become young like you.

116
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:45,311
Richard, reveal your secret.

117
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,032
I'll give you anything you want.

118
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,598
Give me back this house.

119
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,760
And steal Valerie's inheritance?

120
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,913
You intend to do far worse.

121
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,911
- I'll obey your every command.
- Good...

122
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,550
Then let's draw up
a little sales contract.

123
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,629
You will become
young and beautiful again.

124
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,434
It will happen tonight
at the greedy farmer's wedding.

125
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,756
You're a demon!

126
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,392
- This pearl will protect you.
- Eagle, where's Valerie?

127
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,389
- I abducted her.
- Where to?

128
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,832
The church tower.

129
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,433
Come here, you dolt!
You'll take me there too.

130
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,595
Let us pray.

131
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,033
Hear that?

132
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,308
The bells have tolled
and fallen silent for the third time.

133
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,878
This is excellent.

134
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,308
Hardship always
whets one's appetite.

135
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,793
I, for one, experienced terrible things
among the cannibals.

136
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,111
We saved a young black girl.
She was very beautiful.

137
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,238
What happened to her,
Reverend Father?

138
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:55,152
We took her into our tent...
and turned her to our faith.

139
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,838
- She showed great promise.
- Did she become a nun?

140
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,872
Unfortunately not.

141
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,437
- We lost her at a French harbour.
- Martha, where's the wine?

142
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,912
Listen well to what happened.

143
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:20,436
She fell into immoral ways
and broke the sixth commandment.

144
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,151
- I must instruct you in this.
- Thank you, Reverend Father.

145
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,235
Your father, the bishop,
was a delicate man.

146
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,991
He fainted when harlots
came to confession.

147
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:42,030
Gorgeous women adored him.
I'll tell you more someday.

148
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:47,115
- How many children did he have?
- You and a boy.

149
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,591
His name was Eagle.

150
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,428
Eagle?

151
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,996
What's the matter?

152
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,670
I have a headache.
May I go and lie down?

153
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,719
- Dinner isn't over yet.
- Sorry.

154
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,316
Will you toast with us?

155
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,874
- I've never drunk wine before.
- Make an exception today.

156
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,792
To the memory
of the departed bishop.

157
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,958
Eagle!

158
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,900
Eagle...

159
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,432
I've come to chat with you,
dear child.

160
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,556
Now, Reverend Father?

161
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,518
No better time for contemplation.

162
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,678
What breasts you have...

163
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,432
Go away, Reverend Father.

164
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,876
What I want from you
is so sweet.

165
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,120
You are so beautiful.

166
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,516
- You're divine.
- Go away.

167
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,836
You're ravishing!

168
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,596
I can protect myself, you wimp!
My death is on your conscience.

169
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,115
What have you done?

170
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:30,077
The chicken plague is here!

171
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:35,115
The chicken plague is here!

172
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,312
Done.

173
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,072
My house is yours again.

174
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,279
Now we'll wait till midnight.

175
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,351
Come...

176
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,431
It's time.

177
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,474
The end of all my hopes.

178
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:34,196
Come, it's time.

179
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,480
I'm old...

180
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,200
I will also grow old.

181
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,354
- Do you love me.
- I do.

182
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,398
Not a drop of blood.

183
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,397
Don't cry.
You look old when you cry.

184
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,716
Valerie!

185
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,555
Valerie!

186
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,400
Eagle!

187
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:45,075
- Eagle...
- Valerie...

188
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,278
Here...

189
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,950
- Don't look at me like that.
- How?

190
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,678
Kneel down.

191
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,679
Kneel!

192
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,750
- Is it cold?
- No.

193
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,470
I feel like a blind man.

194
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:31,350
We have a guest room.
You can rest there.

195
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:38,197
He threw me from the tower.
The bell's clapper saved me.

196
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,234
I heard it tolling so strangely.

197
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,510
I prayed for you.

198
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,108
The plague is a blessing.

199
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,198
My uncle, the constable
needs blood or he'll die like a dog.

200
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,952
You're so cruel.

201
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:06,795
That monster should have died
100 years ago.

202
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,390
It's nothing...
Just a hanging man.

203
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:34,275
- Where are we?
- Beneath your house.

204
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,437
- I'm scared.
- Be brave.

205
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,676
Who's in the coffins?

206
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,230
Weasel's victims, drained of blood.

207
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,074
Grandmother!

208
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,116
Valerie...

209
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,278
Sorry, I wasn't dressed properly.

210
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,270
This is your room.

211
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:43,316
- I thought it was empty.
- I came by the midnight coach.

212
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:48,317
Don't you recognise me?
I'm a distant cousin.

213
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,839
- Call me Elsa.
- I'm Valerie.

214
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,954
And this... this is my brother.

215
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,633
Eagle.

216
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:05,716
I've taken your room...
or so it seems.

217
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:11,113
- You can have it.
- No, give me another.

218
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:18,072
- I'll speak to Grandmother.
- Your grandmother is gone.

219
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,676
- Without saying goodbye?
- Old people have their whims.

220
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:32,628
- If you'd permit, I'll stay in her room.
- With pleasure.

221
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,873
Now the room is yours.

222
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,910
This way.

223
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,632
- How I'd love to ride a horse.
- I'll lend you mine.

224
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,469
I'm tired. I'm going to lie down.

225
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,473
- You really don't recognise me?
- No.

226
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,313
You aren't afraid of me, are you?

227
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,955
Just an idle question, my dear.

228
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,389
After all,
we've never seen each other.

229
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,675
My earrings!

230
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,832
Your sister isn't back yet?

231
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,195
You know where Valerie is!

232
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,476
You're charming when you're angry!

233
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,517
Where's Valerie?

234
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,675
I'll tell you on one condition.

235
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,120
That you love me.

236
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,436
Never!

237
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,598
Leave, sir!

238
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:31,151
No, I'm not your guest.
You get out.

239
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,429
You'll regret this.

240
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:30,872
Your death will be beautiful.
Die, Valerie, die!

241
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,551
Eagle!

242
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,309
Good night, my sweet brunette

243
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,519
Sweetly sleep this night

244
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:55,879
And when you wake, my pet

245
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:00,192
Hold your secret tight

246
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:04,438
Valerie, you are saved.

247
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:08,036
I heard everything,
my cousin loves you.

248
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:11,192
- Cousin?
- I know.

249
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:15,638
She's my grandmother.
She stole my earrings.

250
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:20,715
But they were empty.
Here is their secret.

251
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:27,711
They'll protect you from death.
Beware of Weasel.

252
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:32,036
- Where is he?
- Dying.

253
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,350
Poor thing.

254
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,034
You've fallen under his spell.

255
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,075
Valerie, I love you.

256
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:48,436
You can't, you're my brother.
Our father was the bishop.

257
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,670
It isn't true, come back!

258
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,436
Weasel is my father.

259
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,956
I should... I shouldn't...

260
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,870
I should!

261
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:30,190
I'm dying... I'm dying...

262
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:33,308
Now you know what it's like to be old.

263
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,958
Valerie!

264
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:40,599
You call her in vain!

265
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:45,158
You sacrificed her to my youth.

266
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,837
You're just as lost as I am.

267
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,514
You'll have the same spasms.

268
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:02,676
Only your granddaughter
could have saved the two of us.

269
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,474
Because she is my blood.

270
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:11,957
Impossible her father was the bishop.
I was the bishop.

271
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,999
- I'm Valerie's father.
- You're lying.

272
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,116
I need to drink...

273
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:22,990
No. First tell me
how to prolong my youth.

274
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,196
Save Valerie.

275
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:30,996
In her blood lies our salvation.

276
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:36,832
Valerie. That cursed Valerie.

277
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,112
It's me.

278
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:50,795
- Father.
- My child...

279
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,954
Help yourself.

280
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,188
No, suddenly it disgusts me.

281
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:13,032
- I'm human again and must die.
- No, you won't die.

282
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,388
You have saved me.

283
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,118
Daddy...

284
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,036
- Let me go.
- I'm a monster again.

285
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,835
Let me go!

286
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,236
No, no...

287
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,915
Gracian!

288
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,435
My Gracian!

289
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,669
Gracian...

290
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,876
Your lover sleeps like a log.

291
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,276
Gracian...

292
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,278
Poor Gracian.

293
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:42,836
I have a plan, Elsa.

294
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,754
I need Eagle's heart.

295
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:53,992
- Will you kill him?
- His heart will give Valerie eternal youth.

296
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,914
Richard, transfer Eagle's heart
into my breast.

297
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,548
You are betraying Valerie.

298
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,436
No, Richard, that's what you're doing.

299
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:12,155
With a bleeding heart...

300
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:23,675
Eagle, why did I leave you?

301
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:48,877
Help! Why do you appear
to me Valerie?

302
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,152
Don't worry, I'm not dead
and neither are you.

303
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,632
Come on, I'll get you out of here.

304
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:06,312
The presbytery is over there,
Reverend Father.

305
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:11,070
Sinner, you tempted me!
Just you wait!

306
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,752
Valerie...

307
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:27,920
Valerie, this is goodbye.
You left me.

308
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:31,231
And that monster violated your mouth.

309
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:36,428
We could have been happy. Too late.

310
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:40,354
Believe me, Weasel is neither
your father nor mine.

311
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:43,273
Now you have prolonged his life.

312
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:48,318
I wanted to be your protector,
friend and husband. Too late.

313
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,631
Goodbye, Valerie. Yours Eagle.

314
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:55,509
Valerie, what's the matter?

315
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,240
- Come here.
- Hedvika...

316
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:15,029
Hedvika, what's wrong?

317
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:22,479
- I've been fading since I wed.
- You need some strong soup.

318
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,153
No.

319
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:29,068
I'm in a vampire's power.

320
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,792
Valerie.

321
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,758
Look what I have on my shoulder.

322
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,995
- Does it hurt?
- Not at all.

323
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:59,152
- Do my lips seem strange?
- No, why?

324
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,470
Aren't they stained?

325
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:04,871
You've just been eating fruit.

326
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:14,157
When you're with me,
I'm not afraid of anything.

327
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:19,838
I am so happy.
I never had a girlfriend before.

328
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:50,999
Valerie, I'm saved...

329
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:55,670
- Hedvika!
- Look, the mark is gone.

330
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:05,233
- Your kisses have cured me.
- You're so beautiful.

331
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:11,154
A witch lives among you.

332
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:15,357
She tortured me with sinful words.

333
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,432
She rubbed her sleek hips
against me.

334
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:23,115
When she realised I could
withstand her seductive ways

335
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,555
she threw a noose around my neck.

336
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:30,516
I thank God I escaped with my life.

337
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:37,036
The witch is hiding among you.

338
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:41,431
In God's name, give her up.
She should burn!

339
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:44,068
Don't believe him!

340
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:50,269
- That's her, the witch.
- I swear he's lying.

341
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:55,514
Grab her, tie her to the stake.

342
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:18,435
Confess that you are a witch.

343
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,311
Liar, liar!

344
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,357
Repent!

345
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,871
Bearded comedian!

346
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,390
Eagle, why did you leave me?

347
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:30,708
Here she is... Valerie...

348
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:58,395
Our masters after their travels
will offer their hands and feet.

349
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:04,556
As they rest their weary heads,
our lips will give them a treat.

350
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:15,359
Get over here, you tramps!

351
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:22,075
You ever had a beating?

352
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,311
Animal!

353
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:04,634
Drink it down, Richard.

354
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,678
He's gone.

355
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,876
A weasel!

356
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:55,392
If only this night
of devilry would end...

357
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,590
Grandmother...

358
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:25,560
- Where did you come from?
- Church. Where else, my child?

359
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:36,108
Did the missionaries leave?

360
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:43,319
What missionaries?

361
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:45,915
What's wrong with you, child?

362
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,190
Nothing, Grandmother.

363
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:15,076
Grandmother, there's a stranger.

364
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:21,908
Just one of the actors
wandering through town.

365
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:50,954
My love, don't go to the theatre.

366
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:57,278
Hitch... up... the horses

367
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:03,308
and drive to Blue Lake.

368
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:13,754
For God's sake, don't shoot.

369
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:17,994
No!

370
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:31,795
Miss, your grandmother is dying.

371
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:39,318
Grandmother...
What's the matter, dearest?

372
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:46,356
Grandmother...

373
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:56,989
The mirror.

374
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:16,070
A carriage drove out without a driver.

375
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:20,236
That's a good sign.

376
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:24,956
I never had the courage
to tell you the truth.

377
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,709
Your mother loved
a young gamekeeper.

378
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:45,753
She bore him two children,
a boy and a girl.

379
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:53,794
But my lover, Richard,
told me the children were his.

380
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:58,557
I sent your mother away
out ofjealousy.

381
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:03,468
I kept the little girl. It's you.

382
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,914
I don't know
where Richard took Eagle.

383
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:10,833
I turned your mother out
with these words.

384
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:16,120
"I'll take you back
only when lone horses bring you."

385
01:06:16,155 --> 01:06:18,634
So my mother is alive?

386
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:26,555
Grandmother!

387
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:56,679
Mummy!

388
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,876
My child!

389
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:11,238
This is your father, my dear.

390
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:18,200
I've seen you before, Father.

391
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:21,318
It must be a childhood memory.

392
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:38,198
Isn't it all just a dream?

393
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:46,153
If only your grandmother
would forgive me.

394
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:40,748
Good night, my sweet brunette

395
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:46,949
Sweetly sleep this night

396
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:53,189
And when you wake, my pet

397
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:59,071
Hold your secret tight

398
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:05,675
Good night, my sweet brunette

399
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:11,876
Sweetly sleep this night

400
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:18,149
And when you wake, my pet

401
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:24,515
Hold your secret tight

402
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:21,193
The End
