VALERIE AND HER WEEK OF WONDERS

2
00:01:08,463 --> 00:01:09,579
Who's there?

3
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,128
Weasel!

4
00:01:46,376 --> 00:01:50,639
Valerie, forgive me.

5
00:01:58,273 --> 00:02:01,012
Where are her earrings?

6
00:02:01,671 --> 00:02:02,717
Speak!

7
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:04,230
I lost them, Constable.

8
00:02:04,287 --> 00:02:05,588
- You're lying, Eagle.
- No I'm not.

9
00:02:05,593 --> 00:02:08,879
You can't get out of this.
I'll give you the water torture!

10
00:02:14,527 --> 00:02:15,643
Eagle!

11
00:02:16,226 --> 00:02:17,454
Bend down!

12
00:02:18,101 --> 00:02:19,526
I will jump on your back.

13
00:02:26,904 --> 00:02:28,416
Hurry up.

14
00:02:28,778 --> 00:02:30,004
You brat.

15
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:27,216
Goodnight, my dark haired girl

16
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:36,890
Goodnight, and sweet dreams

17
00:05:07,576 --> 00:05:09,683
Grandma, the actors have arrived.

18
00:05:10,887 --> 00:05:13,689
You should be more concerned
that the missionaries are coming.

19
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:14,768
When?

20
00:05:16,335 --> 00:05:17,724
Today or tomorrow.

21
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:20,448
One of them will be living with us.

22
00:05:24,222 --> 00:05:26,851
Playing with your earrings, child?

23
00:05:28,755 --> 00:05:30,701
I'm not a child anymore, Grandma.

24
00:05:32,328 --> 00:05:34,200
You see, last night...

25
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,453
At the age of thirteen...

26
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,238
Just like your mother.

27
00:05:51,676 --> 00:05:52,929
I'm warning you...

28
00:05:55,075 --> 00:05:57,121
Get rid of those earrings.

29
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,805
Your mother put them away
on the day she entered the convent.

30
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:04,836
Your father was a bishop.

31
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:08,380
As you know, both are now in heaven.

32
00:06:08,934 --> 00:06:12,256
Is there some secret in these earrings?

33
00:06:14,686 --> 00:06:15,690
Oh, no.

34
00:06:16,385 --> 00:06:20,464
I got them at an auction,
with this house, from a certain Constable.

35
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:22,362
Did you know him?

36
00:06:42,794 --> 00:06:44,604
Grandma, the actors have arrived!

37
00:06:45,975 --> 00:06:47,512
That's just a wedding, dear.

38
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,960
Hedvika is getting married.

39
00:07:01,314 --> 00:07:04,289
Have mercy on her, oh Lord!

40
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:08,278
Deliver her from thy wrath...

41
00:07:08,592 --> 00:07:10,179
Poor Hedvika.

42
00:07:12,906 --> 00:07:13,998
Why?

43
00:07:14,781 --> 00:07:16,900
She'll be a rich farmer's wife now.

44
00:07:43,935 --> 00:07:45,074
Grandma!

45
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,177
Grandma, a monster!

46
00:07:58,185 --> 00:08:00,378
It can't be.

47
00:08:01,453 --> 00:08:03,076
He's dead, after all.

48
00:08:03,893 --> 00:08:05,975
Who are you talking about, Grandma?

49
00:08:09,601 --> 00:08:13,010
Go and practice your piano scales.

50
00:08:13,829 --> 00:08:15,105
Yes, Grandma.

51
00:09:54,495 --> 00:09:56,143
Beautiful maiden,

52
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:00,721
It was I who stole your earrings,

53
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:03,801
and who returned them to your hands again.

54
00:10:04,474 --> 00:10:09,184
My uncle, the Constable,
longs to possess them.

55
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:14,347
He kilted my father and mother,
and now I fear for you.

56
00:10:15,194 --> 00:10:16,793
In church today,

57
00:10:19,683 --> 00:10:22,781
there will be a sermon for maidens.

58
00:10:23,735 --> 00:10:26,375
Pease leave a dress of yours in the arbour,

59
00:10:26,567 --> 00:10:30,423
so that I can talk to you in disguise.

60
00:10:31,622 --> 00:10:33,991
Your unhappy Eagle

61
00:10:34,193 --> 00:10:35,495
Valerie?

62
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:39,860
Valerie?

63
00:10:42,255 --> 00:10:43,743
Where are you my child?

64
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:45,910
Valerie?

65
00:10:47,702 --> 00:10:49,092
Valerie?

66
00:10:52,845 --> 00:10:55,870
It's time to dress for church.

67
00:10:58,292 --> 00:11:01,714
Grandma, may I take
with me a sprig of rosemary?

68
00:12:54,821 --> 00:13:00,349
I, God's servant, a missionary...

69
00:13:01,705 --> 00:13:05,065
I've come before you, dear maidens,

70
00:13:05,932 --> 00:13:08,573
to give you knowledge and God's blessing.

71
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:13,051
Oh maiden, do you know what you are?

72
00:13:14,343 --> 00:13:17,207
You are an alabaster handshake.

73
00:13:18,178 --> 00:13:22,777
You are an uncut pomegranate.

74
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:29,990
You are a boat full of leaves,
and an unfurling rosebud.

75
00:13:32,036 --> 00:13:36,288
The coarse hand that touches your breast

76
00:13:37,221 --> 00:13:41,275
would leave an indelible fingerprint.

77
00:13:43,585 --> 00:13:46,559
But I am here with you, dear maiden.

78
00:13:48,204 --> 00:13:52,047
Like your guardian angel, I bow to you.

79
00:13:55,306 --> 00:13:58,207
And I bless with this wine,

80
00:13:58,663 --> 00:14:01,340
your lips, your breast,

81
00:14:03,107 --> 00:14:04,582
your lap.

82
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:08,612
Amen.

83
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,132
Amen.

84
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:22,450
Eagle?

85
00:14:24,373 --> 00:14:25,799
Eagle?

86
00:14:27,424 --> 00:14:29,011
Eagle?

87
00:15:09,782 --> 00:15:10,898
Eagle!

88
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:16,194
Eagle?

89
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,508
Valerie, is that you?

90
00:15:42,989 --> 00:15:44,822
That monster tortured me.

91
00:15:46,257 --> 00:15:49,504
Valerie, a few words of advice...

92
00:15:51,138 --> 00:15:53,146
- We're in the town square.
- I'm sorry.

93
00:15:54,145 --> 00:15:55,384
Don't look.

94
00:15:58,066 --> 00:15:59,058
Now?

95
00:15:59,244 --> 00:16:00,321
Now!

96
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:02,301
I'm here.

97
00:16:03,469 --> 00:16:04,647
First of all...

98
00:17:12,803 --> 00:17:16,906
Where is the public poorhouse, dear child?

99
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,541
There, Father.

100
00:17:24,264 --> 00:17:27,077
You have acted out of mercy.

101
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:30,170
Or do you not like me?

102
00:17:31,411 --> 00:17:33,357
It's not that, Father.

103
00:17:38,689 --> 00:17:41,006
Bless me, please.

104
00:17:47,448 --> 00:17:48,737
You enter first.

105
00:17:56,773 --> 00:17:59,066
Go on, don't worry.

106
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,841
Please.

107
00:18:09,498 --> 00:18:12,820
This is my kingdom.

108
00:18:40,699 --> 00:18:41,791
Valerie?

109
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,746
Come...

110
00:18:48,719 --> 00:18:49,908
Closer...

111
00:18:52,596 --> 00:18:56,092
Look... come closer.

112
00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:01,401
Look.

113
00:19:02,793 --> 00:19:04,666
Oh no!

114
00:19:09,287 --> 00:19:14,147
I know that I don't
appeal to you anymore, my Gracing.

115
00:19:14,777 --> 00:19:18,831
Only five years ago,
when you were last here...

116
00:19:20,181 --> 00:19:21,768
but now!

117
00:19:28,853 --> 00:19:30,081
Go away!

118
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:33,822
I will lash myself!

119
00:19:34,737 --> 00:19:36,361
Grandma!

120
00:19:36,655 --> 00:19:38,612
Watch!

121
00:19:56,874 --> 00:19:58,424
It's only a dream.

122
00:20:01,842 --> 00:20:06,342
I'm asleep and everything is a dream.

123
00:20:20,101 --> 00:20:21,515
Did he hurt you?

124
00:20:22,323 --> 00:20:23,353
No.

125
00:20:27,161 --> 00:20:29,108
He wants you to love him.

126
00:20:30,256 --> 00:20:32,350
How can I love him when I'm afraid of him?

127
00:20:33,436 --> 00:20:34,602
That's exactly why.

128
00:20:40,584 --> 00:20:41,699
Eagle?

129
00:20:42,413 --> 00:20:43,542
Eagle!

130
00:20:43,939 --> 00:20:45,588
I'm expecting you, Constable.

131
00:20:45,986 --> 00:20:48,019
Damned meddler.

132
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:52,124
Hands up, burglar, or I'll shoot!

133
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:56,672
Elsa, it's me.

134
00:20:58,015 --> 00:21:00,184
Don't you remember me?

135
00:21:04,072 --> 00:21:05,869
Richard...

136
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:12,594
How long since
anybody called me by that name.

137
00:21:18,321 --> 00:21:21,223
Why did you come, Richard?

138
00:21:22,984 --> 00:21:24,597
I missed you so much.

139
00:21:28,302 --> 00:21:32,057
I have never loved another man...

140
00:21:33,226 --> 00:21:36,684
Since the day you seduced me and left.

141
00:21:38,237 --> 00:21:40,071
I'm really sorry about that.

142
00:21:45,428 --> 00:21:48,861
Look at how old you are, Elsa!

143
00:21:49,263 --> 00:21:51,072
You were seventeen then.

144
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,310
I'd give anything
to be young again like you!

145
00:21:54,622 --> 00:21:59,097
Richard, tell me your secret.

146
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:02,818
I'll give you everything you want.

147
00:22:11,443 --> 00:22:13,699
Give me back this house, Elsa!

148
00:22:16,848 --> 00:22:18,843
Then I'd be robbing Valerie.

149
00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:24,724
You are capable of
deeds much worse than that.

150
00:22:31,402 --> 00:22:32,840
Yes, I'll do it.

151
00:22:33,408 --> 00:22:38,551
Very well, let's make a contra_.

152
00:22:41,381 --> 00:22:43,985
You will be young and beautiful again.

153
00:22:45,303 --> 00:22:49,382
It will happen tonight,
at that miserly farmer's wedding.

154
00:22:50,663 --> 00:22:52,002
You're a devil!

155
00:22:55,893 --> 00:22:57,865
This pearl will save you.

156
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:00,373
Eagle, where is Valerie?

157
00:23:00,905 --> 00:23:02,739
- I kidnapped her.
- Where?

158
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,735
To the church tower.

159
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:11,301
Come here, fool!
You will take me there too!

160
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:22,272
Let us pray.

161
00:24:35,165 --> 00:24:36,403
Hear that?

162
00:24:43,792 --> 00:24:47,437
Three times the bells have tolled,
then gone silent again.

163
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,129
This is excellent.

164
00:25:00,484 --> 00:25:03,297
One enjoys any meal after hardships.

165
00:25:03,838 --> 00:25:08,102
Especially after the things
I saw when I was among the cannibals.

166
00:25:10,245 --> 00:25:12,662
We saved a young black girl.

167
00:25:13,296 --> 00:25:14,969
She was very beautiful.

168
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:17,400
What happened to her, Father?

169
00:25:19,876 --> 00:25:25,962
We took her to our tent,
and turned her to our faith.

170
00:25:28,634 --> 00:25:30,680
She showed a great talent.

171
00:25:31,379 --> 00:25:33,624
And did she really become a nun?

172
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,205
Unfortunately not.

173
00:25:38,092 --> 00:25:42,269
- We lost her in a certain French port.
- Martha, where's the wine?

174
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,700
One day I'll tell you what happened to her.

175
00:25:47,155 --> 00:25:49,164
She fell into immoral ways,

176
00:25:49,334 --> 00:25:53,648
and sinned against the sixth commandment.

177
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:58,173
I must give you
a talk on the subject_, dear child.

178
00:25:58,354 --> 00:25:59,979
Thank you, Father.

179
00:26:01,361 --> 00:26:05,081
Your father, the Bishop,
was a sensitive man.

180
00:26:07,202 --> 00:26:10,052
He fainted when prostitutes confessed.

181
00:26:10,732 --> 00:26:13,892
All the beautiful women adored him.

182
00:26:14,566 --> 00:26:16,636
I will tell you more sometime.

183
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:19,351
And how many children did he have?

184
00:26:19,709 --> 00:26:24,828
You, and a boy named Eagle.

185
00:26:26,028 --> 00:26:27,118
Eagle?

186
00:26:28,815 --> 00:26:29,932
What is it?

187
00:26:31,604 --> 00:26:34,667
I've got a headache. May I go and lie down?

188
00:26:35,484 --> 00:26:36,760
Dinner isn't over yet.

189
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,410
Sorry.

190
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,478
Will you toast with us?

191
00:26:44,592 --> 00:26:46,091
I've never had wine before.

192
00:26:46,334 --> 00:26:47,871
Make an exception today.

193
00:26:55,181 --> 00:26:57,325
In memory of the late Bishop.

194
00:27:07,383 --> 00:27:08,474
Eagle!

195
00:27:13,222 --> 00:27:14,300
Eagle!

196
00:27:56,757 --> 00:27:59,731
I want to talk to you, dear child.

197
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:01,798
Now, Father?

198
00:28:02,422 --> 00:28:05,136
There is no better time for contemplation.

199
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,931
What beautiful breasts you have.

200
00:28:10,135 --> 00:28:12,118
Please go away, Father!

201
00:28:16,192 --> 00:28:19,204
I want something sweet from you.

202
00:28:25,301 --> 00:28:27,420
You're beautiful!

203
00:28:30,443 --> 00:28:33,108
- You're so lovely!
- Go away!

204
00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:36,448
You're magnificent!

205
00:28:37,851 --> 00:28:41,669
I will resist you, you coward!
You'll be responsible for my death!

206
00:28:54,628 --> 00:28:56,674
What have you done?

207
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:20,231
The fowl plague is here!

208
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,276
It is done.

209
00:30:10,498 --> 00:30:12,965
My house is yours again.

210
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:20,287
And now we will wait until midnight.

211
00:30:23,396 --> 00:30:25,269
In the bridal chamber.

212
00:31:10,461 --> 00:31:15,146
Come, come, it is time.

213
00:31:20,048 --> 00:31:22,069
The end of all my dreams.

214
00:31:31,902 --> 00:31:34,369
Come, it's time.

215
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:49,094
I'm so old.

216
00:31:51,251 --> 00:31:52,849
I will be too.

217
00:32:30,775 --> 00:32:33,404
- Do you love me?
- I do.

218
00:32:58,448 --> 00:33:00,406
Not one drop of blood.

219
00:33:03,284 --> 00:33:04,450
Don't cry.

220
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:07,806
You look old when you cry.

221
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:32,361
Valerie!

222
00:33:34,182 --> 00:33:35,483
Valerie!

223
00:33:40,064 --> 00:33:41,391
Eagle!

224
00:33:52,965 --> 00:33:54,279
Eagle...

225
00:33:57,061 --> 00:33:58,126
Valerie!

226
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:08,622
Please.

227
00:34:15,101 --> 00:34:16,998
- Don't look at me like that.
- What way?

228
00:34:17,499 --> 00:34:18,639
Kneel down!

229
00:34:22,946 --> 00:34:24,321
Kneel down!

230
00:34:30,311 --> 00:34:31,971
- Is it too cold?
- No.

231
00:34:40,683 --> 00:34:42,170
I'm like a blind man.

232
00:34:43,297 --> 00:34:45,788
There is an empty guest room at our house.

233
00:34:46,566 --> 00:34:48,338
You can relax there.

234
00:34:50,007 --> 00:34:52,227
He threw me down from the tower.

235
00:34:53,232 --> 00:34:55,290
The bell saved my life.

236
00:34:57,504 --> 00:34:59,809
I heard the strange toll.

237
00:35:01,643 --> 00:35:03,949
I prayed for you.

238
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,031
The fowl plague is our best friend.

239
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:19,732
If my uncle, the Constable,
doesn't get enough fresh blood,

240
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,125
- He will die a terrible death.
- You're cruel.

241
00:35:22,865 --> 00:35:25,135
He's a hundred years overdue for death.

242
00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:26,919
The monster.

243
00:35:37,116 --> 00:35:40,091
It's nothing, only a man hanging.

244
00:35:52,892 --> 00:35:54,305
Where are we?

245
00:35:54,765 --> 00:35:56,587
Still under your house.

246
00:35:58,076 --> 00:35:59,366
I'm afraid.

247
00:35:59,951 --> 00:36:01,475
Be brave.

248
00:36:02,784 --> 00:36:04,370
Who is in these coffins?

249
00:36:05,136 --> 00:36:08,595
Weasel's victims.
He sucked their blood. Look here.

250
00:36:16,205 --> 00:36:18,053
Grandma!

251
00:36:19,823 --> 00:36:21,062
Valerie!

252
00:36:52,549 --> 00:36:55,029
Excuse me, I wasn't suitably dressed.

253
00:36:58,606 --> 00:37:00,120
This is your room.

254
00:37:05,929 --> 00:37:08,358
I thought that the room was empty.

255
00:37:09,371 --> 00:37:11,589
I came on the midnight coach.

256
00:37:12,945 --> 00:37:14,605
Don't you recognize me?

257
00:37:15,385 --> 00:37:17,665
I'm your second cousin.

258
00:37:18,129 --> 00:37:19,667
Call me Elsa.

259
00:37:20,832 --> 00:37:22,146
Valerie.

260
00:37:23,926 --> 00:37:27,235
And this is... This is my brother.

261
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:29,474
Eagle.

262
00:37:31,509 --> 00:37:36,269
I have taken your room, it seems.

263
00:37:37,434 --> 00:37:38,674
You may have it.

264
00:37:39,483 --> 00:37:42,619
No, no, you can give me another one.

265
00:37:44,103 --> 00:37:45,936
I'll talk to Grandmother about it.

266
00:37:46,542 --> 00:37:49,729
Your grandmother has gone away, dear child.

267
00:37:50,987 --> 00:37:52,587
Without saying goodbye?

268
00:37:53,429 --> 00:37:56,006
Old people have strange habits.

269
00:38:00,401 --> 00:38:04,256
I hope you will allow me to take her room.

270
00:38:04,367 --> 00:38:05,643
With pleasure.

271
00:38:07,548 --> 00:38:09,321
This room is yours.

272
00:38:14,781 --> 00:38:15,859
Please.

273
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,990
I'd love to ride a horse.

274
00:38:34,174 --> 00:38:35,723
I'll lend you mine.

275
00:38:38,836 --> 00:38:41,154
I'm very tired, I must go to bed.

276
00:38:47,248 --> 00:38:51,028
- You really don't recognize me, Valerie?
- No.

277
00:38:59,275 --> 00:39:01,270
Are you afraid of me?

278
00:39:05,768 --> 00:39:08,408
I'm just joking, my dear.

279
00:39:10,126 --> 00:39:12,257
After all, we've never met before.

280
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:09,747
My earrings!

281
00:41:45,045 --> 00:41:47,624
Your sister hasn't returned yet?

282
00:41:48,444 --> 00:41:50,453
Where is Valerie? Do you know?

283
00:41:52,148 --> 00:41:55,236
You're handsome when you're angry.

284
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,192
Where is Valerie?

285
00:42:00,822 --> 00:42:03,784
I will tell you on one condition...

286
00:42:05,659 --> 00:42:07,617
You must make love to me.

287
00:42:13,154 --> 00:42:14,666
Never!

288
00:42:18,993 --> 00:42:20,382
Leave this room.

289
00:42:21,128 --> 00:42:22,331
No.

290
00:42:22,871 --> 00:42:25,574
I'm not your guest. You go!

291
00:42:26,881 --> 00:42:28,454
You will regret this.

292
00:43:23,489 --> 00:43:26,042
You will have a glorious death!

293
00:43:26,801 --> 00:43:30,879
Die, maiden! Die!

294
00:43:32,422 --> 00:43:35,869
Eagle! Eagle! Eagle!

295
00:43:42,401 --> 00:43:47,508
Goodnight, my dark haired girl

296
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:51,945
Goodnight, and sweet dreams

297
00:43:52,774 --> 00:43:57,930
When you awake, my love

298
00:43:58,308 --> 00:44:02,783
Don't reveal your secret

299
00:44:04,366 --> 00:44:06,212
Valerie, you are saved.

300
00:44:07,328 --> 00:44:08,742
I heard everything.

301
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:11,142
My cousin is in love with you.

302
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:13,118
Your cousin?

303
00:44:13,254 --> 00:44:15,870
I know. She's really Grandma.

304
00:44:17,176 --> 00:44:18,900
She stole my earrings.

305
00:44:19,878 --> 00:44:21,292
But they were empty.

306
00:44:22,843 --> 00:44:24,763
Here is their secret...

307
00:44:28,027 --> 00:44:30,173
They will protect you
from danger and death.

308
00:44:30,948 --> 00:44:32,336
Beware of Weasel.

309
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:35,027
Where is he?

310
00:44:35,829 --> 00:44:37,006
He's dying.

311
00:44:37,832 --> 00:44:38,986
Wretch.

312
00:44:40,447 --> 00:44:42,171
He has bewitched you.

313
00:44:44,762 --> 00:44:45,927
Valerie...

314
00:44:46,854 --> 00:44:48,217
I love you.

315
00:44:50,427 --> 00:44:51,493
You can't!

316
00:44:51,779 --> 00:44:53,600
- We are brother and sister.
- But...

317
00:44:53,695 --> 00:44:56,162
- We have the same father.
- That's not true!

318
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,313
Valerie, come back!

319
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:02,589
Valerie, my father is Weasel!

320
00:45:50,346 --> 00:45:52,478
I will, I won't...

321
00:45:54,181 --> 00:45:56,562
I will, I won't...

322
00:45:57,059 --> 00:45:58,198
I will!

323
00:46:40,853 --> 00:46:43,147
I'm dying!

324
00:46:44,165 --> 00:46:46,385
I'm dying!

325
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:49,733
Now you know what old age is like.

326
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:52,709
Valerie? Valerie?

327
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,612
You're wasting your breath.

328
00:46:56,586 --> 00:46:57,999
Valerie's dying.

329
00:46:59,461 --> 00:47:02,337
I sacrificed her for my youth.

330
00:47:07,218 --> 00:47:10,069
You are as lost as I am.

331
00:47:11,968 --> 00:47:14,238
You will fall into the same agony.

332
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:19,444
Only your granddaughter
could have saved us both.

333
00:47:19,901 --> 00:47:22,032
She has my blood.

334
00:47:24,039 --> 00:47:26,929
How is that?
Her father was the Bishop.

335
00:47:28,397 --> 00:47:30,815
I was the Bishop!

336
00:47:31,622 --> 00:47:33,854
I'm Valerie's father!

337
00:47:34,324 --> 00:47:35,478
You lie.

338
00:47:36,329 --> 00:47:37,494
A drink...

339
00:47:38,421 --> 00:47:39,858
- A drink...
- No!

340
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,401
First tell me how to prolong my youth.

341
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:45,633
Save Valerie!

342
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:52,134
Our salvation lies in her blood.

343
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:55,266
Valerie.

344
00:47:56,375 --> 00:47:58,965
Cursed Valerie.

345
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:07,202
It's me.

346
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:11,266
Father!

347
00:48:12,064 --> 00:48:13,712
My child!

348
00:48:18,164 --> 00:48:19,465
Take this.

349
00:48:27,053 --> 00:48:29,273
No, I'm squeamish!

350
00:48:30,932 --> 00:48:35,011
Im only human again, and I must die.

351
00:48:35,726 --> 00:48:37,758
No, you won't die.

352
00:49:12,114 --> 00:49:13,812
You have saved me.

353
00:49:14,772 --> 00:49:16,011
Father!

354
00:49:22,615 --> 00:49:26,372
- Let me go! Please!
- I'm the monster again!

355
00:49:29,545 --> 00:49:30,747
Let me go!

356
00:49:32,901 --> 00:49:34,474
Leave me alone!

357
00:49:36,299 --> 00:49:38,246
No! No! No!

358
00:50:45,197 --> 00:50:46,945
Gracing!

359
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:50,880
My Gracing!

360
00:50:56,918 --> 00:50:58,257
Gracing!

361
00:51:01,713 --> 00:51:04,650
Your lover sleeps like a log.

362
00:51:06,811 --> 00:51:08,187
Gracing.

363
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:15,754
Poor Gracing.

364
00:51:18,011 --> 00:51:21,705
I have a certain plan, Elsa.

365
00:51:22,979 --> 00:51:24,838
I need Eagle's heart.

366
00:51:27,773 --> 00:51:29,507
You want to kill Eagle?

367
00:51:29,776 --> 00:51:33,223
His heart will reanimate my daughter
and give her eternal youth.

368
00:51:33,656 --> 00:51:37,485
Richard, place Eagle's heart into my chest.

369
00:51:37,751 --> 00:51:40,007
You are betraying Valerie.

370
00:51:42,415 --> 00:51:46,170
Richard, you will do it.

371
00:51:51,044 --> 00:51:53,275
With a bleeding heart.

372
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:01,988
Eagle?

373
00:52:02,505 --> 00:52:03,595
Eagle?

374
00:52:03,898 --> 00:52:05,647
Why did I leave you?

375
00:52:28,651 --> 00:52:29,804
Help!

376
00:52:30,088 --> 00:52:31,229
Help!

377
00:52:31,397 --> 00:52:33,429
Why are you haunting me, Valerie?

378
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:38,198
Don't worry, I'm not dead.
Neither are you.

379
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:41,735
Come on, I'll show you the way out.

380
00:52:49,219 --> 00:52:51,302
The rectory is on the other side, Father.

381
00:52:52,575 --> 00:52:55,563
Sinner, you tempted me to sin!

382
00:52:55,975 --> 00:52:58,094
You will see!

383
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:08,284
Valerie,

384
00:53:10,311 --> 00:53:11,440
Valerie,

385
00:53:11,837 --> 00:53:13,362
This is goodbye.

386
00:53:14,408 --> 00:53:18,449
You have le_ me,
and the monster has disgraced your lips.

387
00:53:19,593 --> 00:53:21,986
We could have been so happy together...

388
00:53:23,342 --> 00:53:24,742
Believe me Valerie,

389
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:28,650
Weasel is neither your father nor mine.

390
00:53:29,835 --> 00:53:32,364
You have prolonged his life.

391
00:53:33,452 --> 00:53:37,431
I wanted be your protector,
friend, and husband, but it's too late.

392
00:53:38,288 --> 00:53:41,127
Farewell Valerie, Your Eagle.

393
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:43,513
Valerie?

394
00:53:44,084 --> 00:53:45,559
Valerie, what happened to you?

395
00:53:45,958 --> 00:53:47,013
Come.

396
00:53:47,266 --> 00:53:48,369
Hedvika.

397
00:54:02,955 --> 00:54:04,119
Hedvika?

398
00:54:05,525 --> 00:54:08,339
Hedvika, what happened to you? Hedvika?

399
00:54:10,841 --> 00:54:12,689
I've wasted away since my wedding.

400
00:54:13,893 --> 00:54:15,900
- You should eat hearty soups.
- No.

401
00:54:16,202 --> 00:54:17,838
No. No. No.

402
00:54:19,776 --> 00:54:21,784
I'm under the spell of a vampire.

403
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:38,882
Valerie?

404
00:54:40,954 --> 00:54:42,615
Look at my shoulder.

405
00:54:48,013 --> 00:54:49,266
Does it hurt?

406
00:54:49,801 --> 00:54:51,635
Oh no. No.

407
00:54:51,936 --> 00:54:53,795
Do you see anything on my lips?

408
00:54:54,072 --> 00:54:56,624
- No, why?
- Aren't they stained?

409
00:54:58,298 --> 00:55:00,293
You've been eating berries.

410
00:55:08,235 --> 00:55:11,358
I'm not afraid of anything
when you're with me.

411
00:55:13,377 --> 00:55:14,926
I'm so happy.

412
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:17,800
I've never had a close friend.

413
00:55:47,673 --> 00:55:48,874
Valerie?

414
00:55:50,068 --> 00:55:51,978
Valerie, I'm saved!

415
00:55:53,293 --> 00:55:55,252
- Hedvika.
- See?

416
00:55:55,472 --> 00:55:57,046
The mark is gone.

417
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:05,703
Your kisses have restored my health.

418
00:56:05,757 --> 00:56:07,208
You're so beautiful.

419
00:56:11,291 --> 00:56:13,560
A witch lives among you!

420
00:56:15,169 --> 00:56:17,711
She tortured me with sinful words.

421
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:21,804
She rubbed her fawning hips against me.

422
00:56:22,839 --> 00:56:26,645
When she found
that I could resist her seduction,

423
00:56:26,893 --> 00:56:29,334
she threw a noose around my neck.

424
00:56:31,164 --> 00:56:34,795
I thank God that I escaped with my life.

425
00:56:38,004 --> 00:56:42,009
But the witch is hidden among you!

426
00:56:43,408 --> 00:56:45,553
In the name of God, hand her over!

427
00:56:45,806 --> 00:56:49,499
- She should be burned to death!
- That's a lie! Don't believe him!

428
00:56:51,165 --> 00:56:53,322
It's her! The witch!

429
00:56:53,563 --> 00:56:56,252
Don't believe him! I swear he's lying.

430
00:56:56,525 --> 00:56:58,200
Be gone, Satan!

431
00:56:59,577 --> 00:57:02,290
Seize her! To the stake with her!

432
00:57:24,503 --> 00:57:27,044
Confess! You are a witch!

433
00:57:29,384 --> 00:57:30,908
Liar, liar.

434
00:57:31,431 --> 00:57:32,906
Atone for your sins!

435
00:57:38,447 --> 00:57:40,431
Moustachioed comedian!

436
00:58:51,397 --> 00:58:54,645
Eagle, why hast thou forsaken me?

437
00:59:46,436 --> 00:59:50,354
Here she is, she's beautiful...

438
01:00:16,157 --> 01:00:18,723
Our masters, back from their travels,

439
01:00:18,903 --> 01:00:21,158
will give us their hands, their feet,

440
01:00:21,342 --> 01:00:23,760
they'll rest their heads,

441
01:00:23,913 --> 01:00:26,306
and we will kiss them.

442
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:38,717
Come here, you whore!

443
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:46,089
Do you want a beating?

444
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:03,677
Beast!

445
01:01:30,936 --> 01:01:34,061
Drink deeply, Richard.

446
01:02:12,119 --> 01:02:13,383
Disappeared!

447
01:02:18,872 --> 01:02:20,844
Weasel!

448
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:33,778
I wish for all this magic to end.

449
01:03:58,535 --> 01:04:06,544
Goodnight, my dark haired girl

450
01:04:06,946 --> 01:04:14,979
Goodnight, and sweet dreams

451
01:04:15,401 --> 01:04:23,532
When you awake, my love

452
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:31,727
Don't reveal your secret

453
01:05:00,242 --> 01:05:01,470
Grandma?

454
01:05:06,954 --> 01:05:08,305
You're back again?

455
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:11,895
Where would I have gone?
I was in church, my child.

456
01:05:21,117 --> 01:05:23,199
Have the missionaries gone yet?

457
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:30,484
What missionaries?

458
01:05:32,186 --> 01:05:33,846
What's wrong, my child?

459
01:05:40,161 --> 01:05:41,561
Nothing, Grandma.

460
01:06:02,647 --> 01:06:03,837
Grandma?

461
01:06:04,607 --> 01:06:06,356
There's a strange boy.

462
01:06:09,923 --> 01:06:13,829
It's only one of the
actors who have come to town.

463
01:06:40,515 --> 01:06:42,449
My dearest,

464
01:06:43,174 --> 01:06:45,282
Do not go to the theatre.

465
01:06:46,529 --> 01:06:48,128
Instead,

466
01:06:49,406 --> 01:06:52,394
as soon as possible,

467
01:06:53,372 --> 01:06:58,602
harness horses,
and drive your carriage to the blue lake.

468
01:07:07,448 --> 01:07:09,456
Don't shoot for God's sake!

469
01:07:13,591 --> 01:07:14,769
No!

470
01:07:24,835 --> 01:07:26,223
Miss!

471
01:07:26,578 --> 01:07:29,652
Miss, your grandmother is dying!

472
01:07:33,682 --> 01:07:34,933
Grandma!

473
01:07:35,730 --> 01:07:37,787
Dearest Grandma, how do you feel?

474
01:07:43,616 --> 01:07:44,943
Grandma.

475
01:07:53,815 --> 01:07:54,991
Grandma.

476
01:07:55,165 --> 01:07:56,455
My mirror.

477
01:08:14,514 --> 01:08:16,919
A driverless carriage
has left the courtyard.

478
01:08:20,571 --> 01:08:22,306
That is a good sign.

479
01:08:24,276 --> 01:08:27,510
I never had the
courage to tell you the truth.

480
01:08:35,737 --> 01:08:39,492
Your mother loved a certain young hunter.

481
01:08:44,757 --> 01:08:46,927
And gave birth to his two children.

482
01:08:48,025 --> 01:08:50,417
A boy and a girl.

483
01:08:54,170 --> 01:08:58,694
But Richard, my lover,
insisted that the children were his.

484
01:08:59,531 --> 01:09:01,898
And I, from jealousy,

485
01:09:02,144 --> 01:09:04,513
drove your mother out of this house.

486
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:07,975
I kept the girl.

487
01:09:08,681 --> 01:09:09,996
That's you.

488
01:09:10,903 --> 01:09:13,768
But Eagle was
stolen away to an unknown place.

489
01:09:14,914 --> 01:09:17,305
I drove out your mother with these words:

490
01:09:17,963 --> 01:09:19,599
"I will only take you in..."

491
01:09:20,578 --> 01:09:23,168
"when the horses
bring you back on their own."

492
01:09:23,542 --> 01:09:25,414
My mother is still alive?

493
01:09:32,737 --> 01:09:34,360
Grandma!

494
01:10:06,162 --> 01:10:07,388
Mother!

495
01:10:07,774 --> 01:10:09,385
My child!

496
01:10:20,585 --> 01:10:22,693
This is your father, my dear.

497
01:10:28,124 --> 01:10:31,062
I know your face from somewhere, Father.

498
01:10:31,436 --> 01:10:34,126
You probably remember it from childhood.

499
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,132
Isn't this only a dream?

500
01:10:58,847 --> 01:11:01,921
If only your grandmother had forgiven me...

501
01:15:40,667 --> 01:15:47,645
Goodnight, my dark haired girl

502
01:15:48,293 --> 01:15:54,850
Don't reveal your secret

503
01:15:55,527 --> 01:15:58,960
Your secret

504
01:15:59,317 --> 01:16:02,578
Your secret

505
01:16:03,197 --> 01:16:10,348
Goodnight, my dark haired girl

506
01:16:10,736 --> 01:16:17,677
Goodnight, and sweet dreams

507
01:16:18,230 --> 01:16:25,322
When you awake, my love

508
01:16:25,857 --> 01:16:33,195
Don't reveal your secret

509
01:16:33,527 --> 01:16:37,084
Your secret

510
01:17:02,506 --> 01:17:06,101
THE END
