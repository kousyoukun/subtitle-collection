00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,090
Stieg Larsson's
The Girl Who Played With Fire

2
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,993
Hello. Welcome.

3
00:01:10,191 --> 00:01:13,368
Come here.
Yes, like that. Much better.

4
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,200
Will you be good to me?

5
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,294
Will you be good to me?
Then I'll be good to you.

6
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:25,753
It's too late.

7
00:04:05,323 --> 00:04:07,335
Solicitor Bjurman?

8
00:04:09,073 --> 00:04:10,678
Yes?

9
00:04:11,116 --> 00:04:15,105
This is regarding a police file
dated 1993. Lisbeth Salander.

10
00:04:16,781 --> 00:04:19,198
My employer would like to take a look at it.

11
00:04:23,324 --> 00:04:27,022
Really?
And who is your employer?

12
00:04:52,532 --> 00:04:54,105
I have the case files stored at my retreat.

13
00:04:54,521 --> 00:04:56,937
- Do you have copies?
- No.

14
00:05:05,032 --> 00:05:08,501
- Is she still abroad?
- Yes, most likely.

15
00:05:25,187 --> 00:05:26,541
Thank you.

16
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,303
Bjurman?

17
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,135
I will stay in touch.

18
00:07:33,196 --> 00:07:36,520
You're supposed file reports about me to
the Guardianship.

19
00:07:37,197 --> 00:07:39,613
- I do.
- Each month. You're sloppy.

20
00:07:40,154 --> 00:07:43,081
- I have some reports stored at my retreat.
- Shut your mouth.

21
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:45,883
If your reports say I'm
behaving well,

22
00:07:46,404 --> 00:07:48,968
I will let you go when I'm no
longer under the Guardianship.

23
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:52,999
If you can't do it, I'll send
our movie to every newspaper in the country.

24
00:07:53,696 --> 00:07:57,206
If something happens to me,
or if I die, it will be made public.

25
00:07:57,905 --> 00:08:01,009
And if you touch me again,
I'll kill you.

26
00:08:01,655 --> 00:08:03,519
And one more thing:

27
00:08:03,987 --> 00:08:07,645
If you visit that clinic in Marseilles
for tattoo removal,

28
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:11,144
I'll redo my work.
On your forehead.

29
00:08:11,737 --> 00:08:14,551
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

30
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:32,029
Is this Zala?

31
00:08:32,487 --> 00:08:34,831
Nils Bjurman.

32
00:08:35,362 --> 00:08:39,789
You're interested the police file on
Lisbeth Salander.

33
00:08:40,613 --> 00:08:42,914
I have it
in a safe place.

34
00:08:43,446 --> 00:08:48,049
I'll let you have it, but only if you
take care of Salander first,

35
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:52,341
She has a DVD
which belongs to me,

36
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,696
When I have it,
you'll get the file,

37
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:58,842
She's back in Sweden,
and probably not difficult to find,

38
00:09:12,321 --> 00:09:14,436
- Do you still see her?
- Who?

39
00:09:14,946 --> 00:09:19,080
- Lisbeth Salander.
- I haven't seen her in a year.

40
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:22,113
- Why is that?
- I don't know.

41
00:09:22,654 --> 00:09:26,571
One day we'll talk.
The next day she won't answer the phone.

42
00:09:27,321 --> 00:09:31,488
We must go now. Dag Svensson
will show up at the editorial meeting today.

43
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:35,383
- Dag who?
- He writes about human trafficking.

44
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:38,112
The girls from Eastern Europe.

45
00:09:39,196 --> 00:09:42,852
- What kind of guy is he?
- Freelance. Young and bold.

46
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:47,519
- Fit.
- Fit?

47
00:09:48,101 --> 00:09:52,236
- For how long have you been working on it?
- About four years.

48
00:09:53,028 --> 00:09:57,601
I found the subject through my girlfriend.
She's researching gender and is a criminologist.

49
00:09:58,446 --> 00:10:01,154
She's pursuing a PhD.
in human trafficking.

50
00:10:01,736 --> 00:10:03,383
So you work as a team?

51
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,675
No, Mia focuses on the girls.

52
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,267
I focus more on distributors
and the span of customers.

53
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,455
And what have you found?

54
00:10:13,861 --> 00:10:16,966
I have found
several prominent customers.

55
00:10:17,612 --> 00:10:19,800
Amongst them
someone from the Justice Department,

56
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,882
who participated in
shaping the new sex market legislation.

57
00:10:23,445 --> 00:10:24,684
Three police men,

58
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:28,029
one from vice,
one from S�K.

59
00:10:28,654 --> 00:10:31,393
Five solicitors
one judge and one prosecutor

60
00:10:31,975 --> 00:10:33,727
The affected girls -

61
00:10:34,194 --> 00:10:37,819
are so low on the social ladder
they're irrelevant to the justice system.

62
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:42,299
Crimes against young Eastern European
girls is not a priority.

63
00:10:43,027 --> 00:10:45,257
A whore is a whore.
That...

64
00:10:45,777 --> 00:10:47,528
...is a part of the system.

65
00:10:48,695 --> 00:10:52,497
How far have you progressed?
- I've completed the research.

66
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:55,758
What's missing is checking the facts -

67
00:10:56,319 --> 00:10:58,841
and confronting the customers I want
to expose.

68
00:10:59,403 --> 00:11:00,935
Hang on.

69
00:11:01,362 --> 00:11:04,756
The last time I didn't check my facts properly,
I spent three months behind bars.

70
00:11:05,444 --> 00:11:08,152
Everybody will get their
chance to comment on the allegations.

71
00:11:08,737 --> 00:11:11,808
There is no need for you to worry.
The documentation is water proof.

72
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19,424
- That sounds reassuring.
- Yes.

73
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,820
Okay...
We don't pay any huge salary.

74
00:11:32,445 --> 00:11:36,173
I suggest
a two month project position.

75
00:11:36,903 --> 00:11:38,986
You can have a desk there.

76
00:11:41,402 --> 00:11:44,549
- Does it sound good?
- Yes, excellent.

77
00:11:45,195 --> 00:11:49,954
We're poking our heads out with this
case. We have to realize that.

78
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:54,851
That is supposedly the whole point of
of Millennium?

79
00:11:55,443 --> 00:11:59,507
- That's why we're sitting here.
- Yes, welcome to Millennium.

80
00:12:02,111 --> 00:12:03,465
Thanks.

81
00:12:30,902 --> 00:12:32,433
Sandstr�m?

82
00:12:35,568 --> 00:12:37,288
Sandstr�m?

83
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:46,902
- We have a job for you.
- I don't think...

84
00:12:47,526 --> 00:12:49,788
Yes, we do, actually.

85
00:13:14,734 --> 00:13:16,453
Hello, Armanskij.

86
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,652
May I come in?

87
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:39,662
More than a year.

88
00:13:47,735 --> 00:13:49,964
What do you want?
Do you need a job?

89
00:13:53,443 --> 00:13:55,672
Do you work some place else?

90
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:04,006
I have been traveling.
I just recently returned to Sweden.

91
00:14:06,235 --> 00:14:08,828
- Where have you been?
- Here and there.

92
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,870
Australia, New Zealand.
The last few months in the Caribbean.

93
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,442
I don't know why
I didn't say goodbye.

94
00:14:22,984 --> 00:14:26,202
Because you don't really
care about other people.

95
00:14:26,859 --> 00:14:30,807
You treat people trying to be your
friends like shit.

96
00:14:32,483 --> 00:14:34,495
It's that simple.

97
00:14:42,193 --> 00:14:44,858
Blomkvist has been looking for you.

98
00:14:46,234 --> 00:14:50,255
He's called at least once
a month to inquire about you.

99
00:14:51,026 --> 00:14:55,088
He cares as well.
Just like Holger Palmgren.

100
00:14:55,859 --> 00:14:58,275
It has been two years since he had a stroke,

101
00:14:58,818 --> 00:15:01,047
and you haven't even visited him.

102
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,316
Is he alive?

103
00:15:03,776 --> 00:15:07,067
You don't even know
if he's dead or alive.

104
00:15:44,025 --> 00:15:46,588
You've been missing.

105
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:52,139
I've been traveling.
I had to run away for a while.

106
00:15:52,734 --> 00:15:54,993
Have you been worried?

107
00:15:56,234 --> 00:15:58,795
No. You can do anything.

108
00:16:01,317 --> 00:16:02,994
That's how it is.

109
00:16:09,732 --> 00:16:12,369
How are things with the new...

110
00:16:14,608 --> 00:16:16,838
...guardian?

111
00:16:17,983 --> 00:16:19,921
Bjurman.

112
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,067
He's okay.
It's okay.

113
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,723
And you're still forced to be
under the supervision of a guardian?

114
00:16:27,358 --> 00:16:29,733
Don't worry about me.

115
00:16:30,274 --> 00:16:33,233
I'll fix it.
It's no longer your job.

116
00:16:33,858 --> 00:16:35,973
No, I'm too old.

117
00:16:36,483 --> 00:16:39,337
I'm just a silly, old fool.

118
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,472
Yes, you are.

119
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:44,827
Truly silly,
if that's what you think.

120
00:16:53,899 --> 00:16:57,524
- I thought you were dead or something.
- Or something.

121
00:16:58,233 --> 00:17:01,263
We didn't meet that often
before you left.

122
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,973
- I was busy.
- It's good to have you back.

123
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,129
I only know one person
who dares knock on the door -

124
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:12,346
after one and a half years of silence
to ask if I want to fuck.

125
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:16,983
...then I broke up with her and
went to Paris. Mom and dad lives there.

126
00:17:17,733 --> 00:17:20,690
I worked in a club
near Clichy.

127
00:17:21,315 --> 00:17:23,398
A fantastic place.

128
00:17:23,899 --> 00:17:26,930
But I had applied for law school,
and been accepted.

129
00:17:27,565 --> 00:17:31,263
- Mom found the letter and told...
- Do you want my apartment?

130
00:17:33,233 --> 00:17:35,940
- What?
- Do you want my apartment?

131
00:17:36,524 --> 00:17:39,264
- Are you moving?
- I have already moved.

132
00:17:40,566 --> 00:17:42,753
I can't afford buying anything.

133
00:17:43,274 --> 00:17:46,420
The rent has been paid for a year.
Do you want it?

134
00:18:00,691 --> 00:18:03,284
- There's just one thing.
- I assumed that much.

135
00:18:03,857 --> 00:18:07,075
I'm still registered here.
My mail is sent here.

136
00:18:07,732 --> 00:18:09,887
You'll take care of it.

137
00:18:11,441 --> 00:18:13,887
I can do that.
Where do you live?

138
00:18:14,441 --> 00:18:17,836
- Some place else.
- Can I visit?

139
00:18:20,816 --> 00:18:22,752
No. Not now.

140
00:18:23,231 --> 00:18:26,596
But you'll come over to fuck me
when you feel like it?

141
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:30,159
I'd like that,
but it's not a part of the contract.

142
00:18:31,846 --> 00:18:34,805
You're not wired properly.
Are you serious?

143
00:18:35,439 --> 00:18:36,460
Yes.

144
00:18:41,939 --> 00:18:43,399
Come here.

145
00:20:11,813 --> 00:20:14,188
Damn, I have something for you.

146
00:20:27,647 --> 00:20:30,313
There you are.
Happy birthday.

147
00:20:31,636 --> 00:20:34,856
- This isn't my birthday.
- It's from last year.

148
00:21:01,439 --> 00:21:03,814
If you're going to keep smoking
that crap,

149
00:21:04,356 --> 00:21:06,658
you might as well do it with elegance.

150
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:15,396
You are the only one
who gives me presents.

151
00:21:30,564 --> 00:21:33,635
- How are you?
- I'm good. Excellent.

152
00:21:36,187 --> 00:21:39,657
Or just OK. I'm trying to get a hold
of one of the customers.

153
00:21:40,354 --> 00:21:43,605
A policeman from S�K.
Gunnar Bj�rck.

154
00:21:44,271 --> 00:21:47,782
But he's nowhere to be found.
As if swallowed by the earth.

155
00:21:48,469 --> 00:21:50,219
It's hopeless.

156
00:21:52,438 --> 00:21:55,584
- What do you have?
- A PO Box address.

157
00:21:57,271 --> 00:21:59,312
A PO Box address?

158
00:22:02,647 --> 00:22:05,062
Try the lottery trick.

159
00:22:06,645 --> 00:22:08,541
- What?
- The lottery trick.

160
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:12,385
Write to the PO Box
and tell him he's won...

161
00:22:13,063 --> 00:22:16,864
...a monster cell phone with GPS
and that he's one of 20 selected

162
00:22:17,604 --> 00:22:21,667
to win 100.000 if he'll participate
in a market research study.

163
00:22:22,438 --> 00:22:24,083
Is it legal?

164
00:22:24,521 --> 00:22:27,303
It can't be illegal
to give away a phone?

165
00:22:27,896 --> 00:22:31,145
Say you're from
Indigo Market Research.

166
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:44,156
Hi, honey.
Sorry I'm late.

167
00:22:46,104 --> 00:22:49,177
We're hitting the press next week,
so we're fucking busy.

168
00:22:49,813 --> 00:22:52,886
Are you the only one
working in that paper?

169
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,104
Everybody's working like animals.
I need more time than the others.

170
00:22:59,896 --> 00:23:03,145
Micke has begun confronting
some of the customers.

171
00:23:03,813 --> 00:23:07,395
He's so experienced
they crap their pants if he just...

172
00:23:08,103 --> 00:23:11,135
It's finished. Printed.
Yes.

173
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:15,645
It's already finished?
"From Russia With Love".

174
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:20,561
"Organized crime and
human trafficking".

175
00:23:21,353 --> 00:23:23,583
- By Mia Bergman.
- That's me.

176
00:23:24,104 --> 00:23:25,603
My girlfriend.

177
00:23:28,645 --> 00:23:30,728
- We have to celebrate.
- Yes.

178
00:23:31,229 --> 00:23:32,874
Give me a kiss.

179
00:23:33,312 --> 00:23:36,385
- Give me a kiss.
- It's finished.

180
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:53,281
Lovely food.
Truly lovely, Annika.

181
00:23:53,978 --> 00:23:57,821
Why do you tell her?
I did the cooking.

182
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:00,791
It's quite tasty, Annika.

183
00:24:01,312 --> 00:24:06,291
- Why don't you get married?
- Leave him be, aunt Angelina.

184
00:24:07,186 --> 00:24:09,561
- He doesn't want to.
- Why not?

185
00:24:10,103 --> 00:24:12,405
He's so handsome.

186
00:24:12,936 --> 00:24:16,229
Mikael, do you have a woman?
You must have a woman.

187
00:24:16,894 --> 00:24:18,791
Yes, I have a woman.

188
00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:23,510
- So marry her.
- I'd love to, but she's already married.

189
00:24:27,852 --> 00:24:29,718
Hi, am I interrupting?

190
00:24:30,186 --> 00:24:33,624
No, I'm at my sister's and
half a platoon of her husbands family.

191
00:24:34,311 --> 00:24:37,312
Sounds nice.
About the pictures...

192
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:42,071
They are on paper, and Mia
and I leave for Dalarna tomorrow.

193
00:24:42,852 --> 00:24:45,374
I don't know if I should send
them with a messenger,

194
00:24:45,937 --> 00:24:50,217
No, don't use a messenger.
I'm leaving soon.

195
00:24:51,019 --> 00:24:53,060
I can give you a lift.

196
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,572
- I'll stop by.
- Great,

197
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:57,488
and one more thing.

198
00:24:57,895 --> 00:25:02,322
I want to run a name.
A criminal named Zala.

199
00:25:03,145 --> 00:25:06,394
Tell him he's Anton
in my dissertation.

200
00:25:07,061 --> 00:25:10,279
- Did you hear that?
- Don't give me new material this late.

201
00:25:10,936 --> 00:25:14,706
No, I know,
but I think it can pay off.

202
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:20,185
- We'll talk about it later.
- Yes,

203
00:25:36,728 --> 00:25:38,551
Two minutes.

204
00:25:52,894 --> 00:25:55,998
- Did something happen?
- It sounded like a gunshot.

205
00:25:56,643 --> 00:25:58,321
Just now.

206
00:26:00,144 --> 00:26:01,862
Dag?

207
00:26:03,227 --> 00:26:06,405
Hello? Hello?

208
00:26:37,602 --> 00:26:39,861
But you reported it?

209
00:26:41,393 --> 00:26:42,747
Yes.

210
00:26:44,018 --> 00:26:48,445
- Did you see what happened?
- No. I found them.

211
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:55,008
It can't have been
more than ten minutes after...

212
00:26:55,726 --> 00:26:58,903
Do you have a description?
Did you see anyone run away from the scene?

213
00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:02,017
No.

214
00:27:03,727 --> 00:27:05,810
Maybe the neighbors saw something.

215
00:27:07,476 --> 00:27:09,123
Do you live here?

216
00:27:11,309 --> 00:27:15,445
No, I was going to visit
the couple living here.

217
00:27:20,268 --> 00:27:22,059
I'll be back.

218
00:27:22,517 --> 00:27:25,591
Hello? Blomkvist?
We have a couple of questions.

219
00:28:13,476 --> 00:28:15,341
You can't have that here!

220
00:28:18,184 --> 00:28:21,913
The murdered couple
was a journalist and a criminologist.

221
00:28:22,642 --> 00:28:26,298
They were found by another journalist.
Blomkvist from Millennium.

222
00:28:27,018 --> 00:28:29,580
- What do we know about the motive?
- Not much at this point.

223
00:28:30,143 --> 00:28:32,736
The girl was about to get her PhD.
in a couple of weeks.

224
00:28:33,309 --> 00:28:36,777
This case has the highest priority.
Assemble a task force.

225
00:28:37,476 --> 00:28:40,330
- Hans Faste, Jerker Holmberg.
- Sonja Modig.

226
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:48,683
You can pick out the team yourself.
But make it quick.

227
00:28:49,892 --> 00:28:52,267
Ekstr�m, prosecutors.

228
00:28:57,726 --> 00:29:01,454
You described the murders
as pure executions.

229
00:29:02,184 --> 00:29:05,840
Which ones on the list are capable of that?
And getting away with it?

230
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,996
We're about to publish the names of
several persons

231
00:29:10,684 --> 00:29:13,101
who'd prefer to stay out of the spotlight.

232
00:29:13,642 --> 00:29:16,308
Some of them
had already been contacted by Dag.

233
00:29:16,891 --> 00:29:21,392
- This is speculation.
- Shouldn't we hand the list over to the police?

234
00:29:22,225 --> 00:29:25,038
- Yes, I suppose we should.
- No.

235
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:34,318
They can have the names of some customers,
but we must never reveal our sources.

236
00:29:35,308 --> 00:29:40,392
It's about the safety of those
girls Mia interviewed.

237
00:29:42,309 --> 00:29:44,538
It can be life or death.

238
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:48,380
Back to the first question:
Are we printing this?

239
00:29:51,557 --> 00:29:55,329
- I think that's what Dag would've wanted.
- Agreed.

240
00:29:57,766 --> 00:29:59,413
Christer?

241
00:30:02,974 --> 00:30:04,694
Sure.

242
00:30:54,183 --> 00:30:58,203
We have received a temporary report
about the murder weapon.

243
00:30:58,973 --> 00:31:02,995
- It's illegal?
- No, it's perfectly legal.

244
00:31:03,766 --> 00:31:07,494
It belongs to
solicitor Nils Erik Bjurman.

245
00:31:08,224 --> 00:31:10,932
Acquired in 1983.
He's got an address on Gardet.

246
00:31:11,516 --> 00:31:13,046
There you go.

247
00:31:13,473 --> 00:31:16,619
We could also identify
two sets of fingerprints.

248
00:31:17,266 --> 00:31:19,714
A woman born in 1981.

249
00:31:21,557 --> 00:31:26,130
Arrested for assault in Gamla Stan
in 1998, when the fingerprints were taken.

250
00:31:26,974 --> 00:31:30,963
- Do you have a name?
- Her name is Lisbeth... Salander.

251
00:31:34,931 --> 00:31:37,599
Lisbeth Salander
seems quite disturbed.

252
00:31:38,182 --> 00:31:40,995
She's under a legal guardian.

253
00:31:41,598 --> 00:31:44,015
Guess who the guardian is?

254
00:31:44,556 --> 00:31:48,286
Solicitor Nils Bjurman.
The owner of the murder weapon in Enskede.

255
00:31:49,016 --> 00:31:51,432
She was already violent in school.

256
00:31:51,974 --> 00:31:55,557
Psychiatric treatment as a teen.
We think she supports herself through prostitution.

257
00:31:56,264 --> 00:31:59,150
And documented
violent tendencies.

258
00:32:00,474 --> 00:32:04,682
- Do we have Salander's address?
- Lundagatan in S�dermalm.

259
00:32:06,139 --> 00:32:08,952
Stop! Police.
Cross the street.

260
00:32:09,556 --> 00:32:13,838
- Have you arrested Salander?
- No, we're waiting for backup.

261
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,587
- Call me.
- I'll call when we're done.

262
00:32:21,099 --> 00:32:24,389
Hookers have no class anymore.

263
00:32:25,057 --> 00:32:28,306
They look more fucked up every day.
Would you pick her up?

264
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:33,651
There has to be a simpler way.

265
00:32:34,222 --> 00:32:38,139
Why call in the storm troopers
to catch one small fish?

266
00:32:38,889 --> 00:32:41,703
The girl is 150 cm tall
and weighs 40 kg.

267
00:32:44,431 --> 00:32:47,243
We're in
but the apartment is empty.

268
00:32:47,847 --> 00:32:49,420
Affirmative.

269
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,255
- Faste?
- Yes?

270
00:32:56,765 --> 00:32:59,400
Why did it say Salander Wu
on the door?

271
00:33:01,932 --> 00:33:03,577
Have no idea.

272
00:33:24,055 --> 00:33:29,211
Hello, this is Bjurman. Please leave
a message and I'll get back to you.

273
00:33:45,806 --> 00:33:47,159
Hello?

274
00:33:53,056 --> 00:33:54,482
Hello?

275
00:34:05,473 --> 00:34:08,941
Snap one from that angle as well,
so we get it properly.

276
00:34:12,721 --> 00:34:14,441
She's in there..

277
00:34:22,888 --> 00:34:25,669
Thanks. My coffee craving was
about to kill me.

278
00:34:26,263 --> 00:34:27,983
What have you found?

279
00:34:28,431 --> 00:34:32,711
Bjurman, and an empty Magnum bullet box.
We're checking it for prints.

280
00:34:33,513 --> 00:34:36,222
And copies of monthly reports on
Salander,

281
00:34:36,806 --> 00:34:39,471
which he's been sending
to the Guardianship.

282
00:34:41,638 --> 00:34:44,742
According to the reports
Salander is basically an angel.

283
00:34:47,472 --> 00:34:51,273
We have turned him around.
There is something you should see.

284
00:34:54,472 --> 00:35:00,106
"I am a sadistic pig and a rapist."

285
00:35:02,971 --> 00:35:06,367
- What do you think?
- Not a bad motive for murder.

286
00:35:17,347 --> 00:35:20,232
LISBETH 28
SOUGHT FOR THREE MURDERS

287
00:35:30,804 --> 00:35:32,596
SOUGHT FOR THREE MURDERS
IN ENSKEDE

288
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:35,887
HUNTED FOR THREE MURDERS

289
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:42,847
JOURNALIST BLOMKVIST
FOUND THE MURDER VICTIMS

290
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:07,367
This afternoon another
victim was found.

291
00:36:08,054 --> 00:36:12,648
The 56 year old socially committed
solicitor was found shot in his apartment.

292
00:36:13,263 --> 00:36:17,627
Police is investigating
if the murders are connected.

293
00:36:18,553 --> 00:36:22,471
One of the victims worked for
the newspaper Millennium,

294
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:26,398
where Blomkvist
is editor in charge.

295
00:36:27,054 --> 00:36:31,221
According to Blomkvist,
Svensson was about to write about

296
00:36:32,012 --> 00:36:34,971
IT security and hackers.

297
00:36:35,596 --> 00:36:39,658
It's a great loss
for his family and colleagues

298
00:36:40,428 --> 00:36:43,095
and the whole journalist community.

299
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:47,148
A brutal attack
on free society.

300
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,533
- Why did you tell them that?
- Because it's true.

301
00:36:53,386 --> 00:36:55,834
One of Dag's specialties was hacking.

302
00:36:56,387 --> 00:36:59,606
We had agreed that it would
be his next case.

303
00:37:00,252 --> 00:37:04,314
And I want to find a certain person
before the police does.

304
00:37:05,096 --> 00:37:09,408
Lisbeth reads everything I write.
No matter where she is.

305
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:13,136
And she's quite interested in the subject.

306
00:37:13,761 --> 00:37:17,533
This statement might make her contact me.

307
00:37:18,262 --> 00:37:21,221
- You have no doubts?
- About what?

308
00:37:22,971 --> 00:37:24,136
No.

309
00:37:27,261 --> 00:37:29,898
- No?
- Lisbeth has not murdered anyone.

310
00:37:38,293 --> 00:37:42,460
- That's Dag's phone.
- I'll get it.

311
00:37:50,219 --> 00:37:54,533
- Indigo Market Research.
- Good morning, my name is Gunnar Bj�rck.

312
00:37:55,344 --> 00:37:58,896
I have received an
interesting offer from you.

313
00:38:48,303 --> 00:38:51,188
THIS IS WHERE POLICE FOUND IRINA

314
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,657
DAG SVENSSON'S RESEARCH COPY

315
00:39:04,011 --> 00:39:08,583
- Which documents were she looking for?
- The e-mail log from Svensson.

316
00:39:09,417 --> 00:39:11,573
Or his research.

317
00:39:12,084 --> 00:39:15,333
- Can you track her?
- No. She doesn't work like that.

318
00:39:16,011 --> 00:39:18,574
She's got a reason to stay hidden.

319
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:23,510
- Do you think she's guilty as well?
- I'm not saying anything.

320
00:39:25,303 --> 00:39:29,251
I know she hasn't done anything.
Not this time.

321
00:39:31,594 --> 00:39:34,260
Why do you ask, mom?

322
00:39:34,843 --> 00:39:39,302
The fucking police did it.
The pigs!

323
00:39:40,135 --> 00:39:42,584
This place looks fucking awful.

324
00:39:43,135 --> 00:39:46,573
I don't know.
She has vanished.

325
00:39:47,261 --> 00:39:49,636
Wait, somebody is at the door.

326
00:39:53,844 --> 00:39:55,999
Hi, Miriam.
Tony Scala, journalist.

327
00:39:56,511 --> 00:39:59,145
Your girlfriend
is suspected of three murders.

328
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:03,156
Can you confirm that you
spent time abroad with Salander?

329
00:40:03,844 --> 00:40:06,990
You have to talk to the media
sooner or later. I can help you.

330
00:40:07,634 --> 00:40:10,124
Go to hell, you fucking pig!

331
00:40:18,676 --> 00:40:20,687
A double espresso.

332
00:40:24,552 --> 00:40:27,114
Why do you think Lisbeth is innocent?

333
00:40:27,677 --> 00:40:30,969
She had no reason to kill Dag or Mia.
Especially not Mia.

334
00:40:31,634 --> 00:40:35,218
Mia wanted to expose human trafficking.
Sounds like something Lisbeth could've done.

335
00:40:35,916 --> 00:40:38,479
Lisbeth detests men
who hate women.

336
00:40:39,041 --> 00:40:42,000
We have proof she was at
the scene of the crime.

337
00:40:42,634 --> 00:40:46,729
- So you found fingerprints?
- Yes, she's connected to the murder weapon.

338
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:50,614
That doesn't mean she
pulled the trigger.

339
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:55,323
- And Bjurman? Her guardian?
- The answer lies in Svensson's research.

340
00:40:56,092 --> 00:41:00,333
This is a police matter. We do not need
private detectives and their wild theories.

341
00:41:01,135 --> 00:41:05,781
I have no theories. I'm stating
that Lisbeth did not kill Dag and Mia.

342
00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:10,061
I want to present evidence.
I want to point out an alternative killer

343
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:15,291
and write an article you and your
peers won't like ...at all.

344
00:41:40,499 --> 00:41:43,645
- This is Bj�rck.
- Hi, this is Indigo.

345
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:48,581
- Good, did you receive the travel instructions?
- Yes, that's not a problem.

346
00:41:49,374 --> 00:41:52,404
This lottery and the cell phone ...

347
00:41:53,051 --> 00:41:55,937
You're still one of the 20 selected.

348
00:42:01,593 --> 00:42:03,895
- Have we met before?
- No.

349
00:42:04,416 --> 00:42:06,165
You seem familiar.

350
00:42:08,301 --> 00:42:10,561
Maybe you've seen me in the paper.

351
00:42:12,509 --> 00:42:15,655
- What was your name again?
- Mikael Blomkvist. Journalist.

352
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,789
I work for Millennium.

353
00:42:19,343 --> 00:42:22,414
I didn't know
you do market research.

354
00:42:24,467 --> 00:42:26,186
Sure, sometimes.

355
00:42:27,509 --> 00:42:31,676
Look at these three pictures
and tell me...

356
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:35,644
...which model you prefer.

357
00:42:37,675 --> 00:42:40,488
First off, this is Lidia Kamarova.

358
00:42:41,092 --> 00:42:45,445
She is 16 years old
and from Minsk in Belarus.

359
00:42:47,123 --> 00:42:50,009
Then we have Myang So Hun.

360
00:42:50,633 --> 00:42:54,102
She is 25 years old, a little older,
but it doesn't show.

361
00:42:54,799 --> 00:42:57,759
She's also called Jo-Jo.
She's from Thailand.

362
00:42:59,759 --> 00:43:05,060
And then we have Silvia,
her real name is Jelena Barasova.

363
00:43:07,259 --> 00:43:09,747
She's 19 years old and from Tallinn.

364
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:13,372
You have paid for sex
from all these women.

365
00:43:14,009 --> 00:43:17,446
So what I want to know is
which one is your favorite.

366
00:43:20,217 --> 00:43:22,956
- Is this a joke?
- No.

367
00:43:24,591 --> 00:43:28,976
Our journalist Dag Svensson had
documentation proving

368
00:43:29,799 --> 00:43:31,987
that you paid them for sex.

369
00:43:32,498 --> 00:43:34,800
- Did he contact you?
- Who?

370
00:43:35,342 --> 00:43:39,111
- Dag Svensson.
- I've never heard that name.

371
00:43:41,008 --> 00:43:43,643
- Now I want you to leave.
- Yes, that might be so.

372
00:43:44,217 --> 00:43:47,435
He did not manage to confront you
with the documentation

373
00:43:48,081 --> 00:43:50,455
before someone shot him.

374
00:43:51,008 --> 00:43:53,967
Do you know solicitor Bjurman,
who was also shot and killed?

375
00:43:54,592 --> 00:43:56,456
What do you want?

376
00:43:56,914 --> 00:44:01,196
I want to allow the sex buyers to
comment on the facts

377
00:44:02,007 --> 00:44:05,372
in our next theme issue on
human trafficking.

378
00:44:13,581 --> 00:44:17,050
You do understand that you will
ruin my life if you print this?

379
00:44:18,383 --> 00:44:19,694
Yes.

380
00:44:35,133 --> 00:44:37,320
Several visits with Irina
Check Anton = Zala

381
00:45:32,924 --> 00:45:34,819
Come on. Get up.

382
00:45:36,591 --> 00:45:38,195
Get up.

383
00:45:41,548 --> 00:45:45,610
I'm going to ask you some questions,
Per Ake. If you answer, I'll let you live.

384
00:45:46,382 --> 00:45:50,549
If you refuse, I'll zap you again.
100.000 volts.

385
00:45:51,339 --> 00:45:54,965
If you lie or answer confusingly,
I'll zap you.

386
00:45:56,256 --> 00:45:59,403
Your muscles will stop working,
and you'll hang yourself.

387
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:02,902
And I'm leaving.
Understand?

388
00:46:07,799 --> 00:46:09,767
I don't want to die.

389
00:46:10,256 --> 00:46:13,653
My mistake. I forgot to tell you that
you can't speak without my permission.

390
00:46:25,297 --> 00:46:28,590
- Is this your daughter?
- Yes. She'll be here any minute...

391
00:46:29,257 --> 00:46:31,340
You're breaking the rules again.

392
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,923
- Do you want to die?
- No.

393
00:46:45,423 --> 00:46:49,880
In January you visited Irina
in an apartment in Norsborg. Why?

394
00:46:52,631 --> 00:46:56,100
I don't know...
I wanted her. She was beautiful.

395
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,797
- Beautiful?
- Yes, she was beautiful.

396
00:47:00,255 --> 00:47:03,620
And that gave you the right
to tie her up and fuck her?

397
00:47:13,423 --> 00:47:16,714
You are a sadistic pig and a rapist.

398
00:47:18,547 --> 00:47:20,121
Isn't that so?

399
00:47:34,256 --> 00:47:36,079
Who is Zala?

400
00:47:38,006 --> 00:47:40,713
- I don't know.
- Don't abuse your chance.

401
00:47:41,297 --> 00:47:45,214
I don't know who he is.
The journalist you shot asked about him as well.

402
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:48,526
If I knew I would tell you.

403
00:47:49,088 --> 00:47:51,683
I only spoke to someone who said
his name was Zala.

404
00:47:52,255 --> 00:47:55,110
- One minute on the phone.
- Why?

405
00:47:55,714 --> 00:47:59,005
I was supposed to import a car
with amphetamine from Tallinn.

406
00:47:59,671 --> 00:48:01,277
I didn't want to.

407
00:48:01,713 --> 00:48:06,359
They showed up a few days later
and told me I couldn't pull out.

408
00:48:07,214 --> 00:48:09,702
Then they forced me
to come with them to...

409
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:14,558
- To?
- Some storage facility.

410
00:48:15,171 --> 00:48:19,412
The first thing I saw was a man
on the floor, beaten to a pulp.

411
00:48:21,338 --> 00:48:23,599
- And he was there...
- Who? Zala?

412
00:48:24,129 --> 00:48:28,150
No, a blond fucker.
Pure muscle.

413
00:48:28,922 --> 00:48:31,807
I've only seen him once before.
Damn.

414
00:48:32,421 --> 00:48:35,057
- What's his name?
- I don't know.

415
00:48:37,422 --> 00:48:39,390
What else happened?

416
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,879
They said the guy
on the floor was a snitch.

417
00:48:43,505 --> 00:48:47,599
The blond raised him up
on a chair in front of me.

418
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:52,296
Then he put his hands
around his neck.

419
00:48:55,047 --> 00:48:57,462
I heard his neck snapping.

420
00:48:59,962 --> 00:49:03,359
He died before my eyes.

421
00:49:07,879 --> 00:49:11,870
Then the blond wrapped his
hands around my neck.

422
00:49:13,297 --> 00:49:18,567
Magge held a phone to my ear
and told me Zala wanted to speak to me.

423
00:49:19,505 --> 00:49:22,098
What did he say?
Zala?

424
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:29,014
I was to do as I was told.
What choice did I have?

425
00:49:31,712 --> 00:49:33,212
Hello.

426
00:50:22,378 --> 00:50:25,890
We have to get back.
I have a lunch meeting.

427
00:50:40,586 --> 00:50:43,149
Have you been in contact with her?

428
00:50:44,879 --> 00:50:46,483
Who?

429
00:50:49,253 --> 00:50:51,482
Who do you think?

430
00:50:53,545 --> 00:50:57,607
An old friend called this morning.

431
00:50:58,379 --> 00:51:02,294
He's also convinced
Lisbeth Salander is innocent.

432
00:51:03,046 --> 00:51:05,461
- Who?
- That's completely skewed.

433
00:51:07,169 --> 00:51:09,139
Erika?

434
00:51:09,628 --> 00:51:14,680
It's best if you meet and
discuss it yourselves.

435
00:51:18,128 --> 00:51:21,056
Jab, Paolo! Come on!
Give him a jab!

436
00:51:24,462 --> 00:51:28,159
Move your feet, man.
Concentrate on your foot work. Come on!

437
00:51:28,878 --> 00:51:30,670
Don't give up.

438
00:51:32,837 --> 00:51:34,920
From where do you know Lisbeth?

439
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:37,681
We've boxed together since
she was 17.

440
00:51:38,211 --> 00:51:43,044
- Not in the same weight class.
- She's quite tough.

441
00:51:48,336 --> 00:51:50,524
She's in trouble, yes?

442
00:52:03,712 --> 00:52:07,732
She's in deep deep trouble.
Paolo, you have to help me.

443
00:52:08,502 --> 00:52:12,085
I need to get in touch with
Lisbeth's girlfriend, Miriam Wu.

444
00:52:12,794 --> 00:52:16,117
- Have you read about her?
- I know her. Kick boxer.

445
00:52:16,794 --> 00:52:20,232
She refuses to talk to me because I'm
a journalist.

446
00:52:20,919 --> 00:52:24,284
If you, as a known boxer,
talk to her...

447
00:52:24,961 --> 00:52:28,137
And try to reach Lisbeth through her?

448
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:41,730
Fuck...!
Come on!

449
00:54:25,168 --> 00:54:28,969
Micke? You asked me to dig into
Gunnar Bj�rck's past.

450
00:54:29,709 --> 00:54:32,085
I ran into Nils Bjurman.

451
00:54:32,627 --> 00:54:36,064
He was an officer in the security
department of the National Police Force.

452
00:54:36,752 --> 00:54:39,928
- What? When was that?
- From '76 until '78.

453
00:54:42,792 --> 00:54:46,929
- Same time as Bj�rck.
- Fuck...!

454
00:56:32,209 --> 00:56:34,438
- Where is she?
- Who?

455
00:56:34,959 --> 00:56:37,916
- Lisbeth Salander.
- I told you, I don't know!

456
00:56:38,542 --> 00:56:40,551
Wrong answer.

457
00:56:46,041 --> 00:56:49,406
You have one more chance.
Then I'll start using this.

458
00:57:00,249 --> 00:57:01,781
Run, Miriam!

459
01:01:23,873 --> 01:01:26,434
- Hello?
- Micke, it's Paolo,

460
01:01:26,997 --> 01:01:29,925
I'm at the hospital
with Miriam Wu.

461
01:01:30,538 --> 01:01:33,133
- What?
- Would be nice if you could come by.

462
01:01:53,664 --> 01:01:57,684
I didn't shoot Dag and Mia.
If you want to help, find Zala, Lisbeth.

463
01:02:12,163 --> 01:02:14,465
I can give and receive punches,

464
01:02:14,997 --> 01:02:17,996
but he was no ordinary human.

465
01:02:18,622 --> 01:02:22,642
- What did he look like?
- A blond, armor penetrating robot.

466
01:02:23,414 --> 01:02:26,590
- He was pure muscle.
- And you never saw him before?

467
01:02:27,246 --> 01:02:30,278
Never.
He moved exactly like a boxer.

468
01:02:30,912 --> 01:02:34,466
He kept his guard up,
but at the same time seemed completely clueless.

469
01:02:35,162 --> 01:02:38,787
- Clueless in what way? On drugs?
- No, it was very strange.

470
01:02:39,497 --> 01:02:43,122
As if he had trained,
but never listened to his coach!

471
01:02:47,372 --> 01:02:50,111
And then there was something
fucking scary.

472
01:02:51,997 --> 01:02:55,214
I hit him rock hard.
About 100 punches went straight in.

473
01:02:55,871 --> 01:02:59,674
But nothing happened.
As if he didn't feel anything.

474
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:05,517
- Hello. Ward 1B?
- Further down the hall.

475
01:03:06,205 --> 01:03:07,924
Jan Bublanski.

476
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:11,528
- How are you?
- Splendid.

477
01:03:15,996 --> 01:03:19,245
I'll find a place where
we can talk uninterrupted.

478
01:03:22,788 --> 01:03:26,183
- How is Miriam Wu?
- They're still examining her.

479
01:03:26,871 --> 01:03:29,506
She looks like me.
It wasn't her they were after.

480
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:32,526
It was Lisbeth Salander.

481
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:37,913
We have identified 29 customers
and pimps from Dag's list.

482
01:03:38,788 --> 01:03:42,703
In theory, they all had a motive
to murder Dag.

483
01:03:43,454 --> 01:03:48,392
Eight names are missing.
We've given them pseudonyms.

484
01:03:49,288 --> 01:03:52,392
- What are we doing about them?
- Malin is trying to identify them.

485
01:03:53,038 --> 01:03:56,183
Some of the pseudonyms are
mentioned in Mia's dissertation.

486
01:03:56,828 --> 01:04:00,995
We can find references there
which can lead to the names.

487
01:04:01,788 --> 01:04:05,996
First I'd like to visit the
Dag wanted to expose.

488
01:04:06,786 --> 01:04:10,807
- They have the most to lose.
- Then we can do the following.

489
01:04:13,329 --> 01:04:15,996
Sten Falstr�m, done.
He's done.

490
01:04:16,578 --> 01:04:19,433
Karl Pettersson, done.
Per �ke Sandstr�m.

491
01:04:20,037 --> 01:04:23,109
He's been confronted by Dag,
so we'll expose him.

492
01:04:23,746 --> 01:04:26,485
And the guy from the security police force?
Bj�rck?

493
01:04:27,078 --> 01:04:30,880
What about the connection between him
and Bjurman? What about this Zala?

494
01:04:31,621 --> 01:04:34,579
I'm not completely finished
with Bj�rck.

495
01:04:50,370 --> 01:04:53,515
- It's Bj�rck.
- Blomkvist here. You never called.

496
01:04:54,161 --> 01:04:55,693
What do you want?

497
01:04:56,119 --> 01:04:59,671
You lied to me. You and Bjurman
worked together at S�PO in the 70s,

498
01:05:00,369 --> 01:05:04,287
Why would I tell you
who I worked with?

499
01:05:05,036 --> 01:05:09,203
Tomorrow I'm holding a press conference
regarding the murders of Dag and Mia,

500
01:05:09,995 --> 01:05:13,245
I will give details about
our article series on sex trade,

501
01:05:13,911 --> 01:05:16,473
and you're the only customer
I'll expose.

502
01:05:17,036 --> 01:05:19,598
So you'll have the opportunity
to comment.

503
01:05:20,161 --> 01:05:23,411
You want to destroy my life.
Why would I talk to you?

504
01:05:24,078 --> 01:05:27,401
Since you know Bjurman,
you probably know Zala as well?

505
01:05:29,245 --> 01:05:30,672
Hello?

506
01:05:34,495 --> 01:05:36,724
You know who he is?

507
01:05:39,369 --> 01:05:42,224
What is that information
worth to you?

508
01:05:58,578 --> 01:06:02,016
His real name is Zalachenko,
but he's called Zala.

509
01:06:06,745 --> 01:06:10,297
What I'm about to tell you now is
top secret.

510
01:06:10,995 --> 01:06:15,566
You understand it's important to me
that you guarantee source protection.

511
01:06:16,410 --> 01:06:18,452
I've already done that.

512
01:06:18,952 --> 01:06:22,974
Zalachenko was born in 1940
in what was then the Soviet Union.

513
01:06:23,743 --> 01:06:28,463
Both parents died during the war..
I assume you know what GRU was?

514
01:06:29,328 --> 01:06:32,505
Yes, the military intelligence.

515
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:37,078
He made his career in GRU.
Speaks six languages fluently.

516
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:41,078
Expert in camouflage
and survival techniques.

517
01:06:42,244 --> 01:06:44,692
Over the years he became
more and more corrupt.

518
01:06:45,244 --> 01:06:49,160
GRU sent a military attach� -

519
01:06:49,911 --> 01:06:53,859
from the embassy in Madrid
to find him -

520
01:06:54,619 --> 01:06:56,733
and correct his ways.

521
01:06:58,827 --> 01:07:02,483
Something went wrong
during that conversation.

522
01:07:06,577 --> 01:07:08,369
Cut to the chase.

523
01:07:11,201 --> 01:07:13,941
Zalachenko killed the
man from the embassy.

524
01:07:15,494 --> 01:07:18,056
He realized he had burned all bridges,

525
01:07:18,619 --> 01:07:21,869
went to Sweden, contacted the
security police and applied for asylum.

526
01:07:22,535 --> 01:07:25,462
- And?
- The actions of the government?

527
01:07:26,077 --> 01:07:29,660
When a soviet top spy
applies for asylum?

528
01:07:30,368 --> 01:07:34,795
Never before had an operation's chief
for one of GRU's elite commands

529
01:07:36,869 --> 01:07:38,586
deserted to Sweden.

530
01:07:39,035 --> 01:07:41,003
- So he could stay?
- Yes.

531
01:07:41,494 --> 01:07:44,816
- And started working for you?
- He was a gold mine.

532
01:07:45,493 --> 01:07:49,410
We gave him a Swedish identity,
a passport and some money.

533
01:07:50,159 --> 01:07:52,243
From then on he managed on his own.

534
01:07:52,743 --> 01:07:56,295
In return we received good favors for
the information he provided us.

535
01:08:02,952 --> 01:08:05,909
What about Bjurman?
Where does he enter the picture?

536
01:08:06,535 --> 01:08:08,139
Bjurman...

537
01:08:08,577 --> 01:08:11,681
We were young back then.
What were we? 25? 30?

538
01:08:12,327 --> 01:08:16,712
Not really qualified to handle
someone like Zalachenko.

539
01:08:18,742 --> 01:08:22,107
He came to us
on election day in '76.

540
01:08:22,785 --> 01:08:25,743
Hardly a soul to be found
at the police station.

541
01:08:26,368 --> 01:08:30,212
Everybody had time off
or were busy with the election.

542
01:08:30,952 --> 01:08:35,118
I was the officer in charge, and considered
it a common immigration matter.

543
01:08:35,909 --> 01:08:39,014
I brought Bjurman as caseworker.

544
01:08:39,659 --> 01:08:43,430
His further involvement
was completely random.

545
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:47,045
- Random?
- Yes, actually.

546
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:49,305
"Praktvindel." (Beach Moonflower)

547
01:08:50,868 --> 01:08:52,951
- What?
- That's what it's called.

548
01:08:56,867 --> 01:08:59,680
- Where is Zalachenko today?
- I don't know.

549
01:09:00,285 --> 01:09:03,981
I had his case until 1985.
I then received other tasks.

550
01:09:08,867 --> 01:09:12,264
You gave him a new identity
and a Swedish name. What is it?

551
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:15,211
- That I won't tell you.
- Come on.

552
01:09:15,743 --> 01:09:17,753
You wanted to know who Zala is.

553
01:09:18,242 --> 01:09:20,804
I'm not saying more until I know
you're true to your word.

554
01:09:21,367 --> 01:09:24,992
I believe Zalachenko committed three murders,
and the police is hunting the wrong person.

555
01:09:25,701 --> 01:09:29,545
- Why isn't Salander the murderer?
- I believe Zalachenko did it.

556
01:09:30,283 --> 01:09:32,106
You are mistaken.

557
01:09:32,576 --> 01:09:36,305
Zala has not murdered anyone.
He's 69 and somewhat disabled.

558
01:09:37,033 --> 01:09:41,128
Walks around on crutches. He's not been
running around shooting people.

559
01:09:41,909 --> 01:09:45,564
If he wants to commit murder,
he'll have to order welfare transport.

560
01:09:46,283 --> 01:09:49,168
I hope I won't have to see
my name in your paper now.

561
01:11:50,323 --> 01:11:52,365
What do you want for it?

562
01:11:52,866 --> 01:11:56,261
Half. 200.000.
Cash.

563
01:11:58,366 --> 01:12:02,095
Okay. I don't have the money here,
but we'll go pick them up.

564
01:12:02,823 --> 01:12:05,417
- When?
- At once.

565
01:12:05,990 --> 01:12:08,105
I'll go pick them up.

566
01:12:09,272 --> 01:12:12,969
- How did it go?
- With what?

567
01:12:14,522 --> 01:12:16,168
What do you mean?

568
01:12:16,605 --> 01:12:19,927
Bjurman's retreat, you were
supposed to burn it to the ground.

569
01:12:22,573 --> 01:12:26,376
We... We were just about to.
We haven't had time yet.

570
01:12:28,241 --> 01:12:29,845
No time?

571
01:12:30,282 --> 01:12:34,230
We'll fix it right away.
We'll pick up the money afterwards.

572
01:12:34,990 --> 01:12:37,918
We'll be right back with the cash.
Okay?

573
01:12:47,157 --> 01:12:48,906
I'll wait here.

574
01:14:40,989 --> 01:14:43,843
What the fuck...?
It's that little bitch Salander.

575
01:14:45,906 --> 01:14:48,166
We've been fucking looking for you.

576
01:14:48,687 --> 01:14:51,613
Not even your little girlfriend
knew where you were.

577
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:55,677
At least that's what she told us.
Right, Magge?

578
01:14:56,364 --> 01:14:58,259
Fucking carpet muncher.

579
01:15:00,406 --> 01:15:02,708
I think she could use some cock.

580
01:15:09,031 --> 01:15:10,748
Try it.

581
01:15:11,197 --> 01:15:13,499
Move, fucking retard.

582
01:15:22,406 --> 01:15:24,894
What the fuck are you doing?

583
01:15:26,739 --> 01:15:28,489
Oh shit...

584
01:15:32,113 --> 01:15:34,196
Knock her out, man!

585
01:16:59,695 --> 01:17:02,258
- There is something you don't know.
- What is that?

586
01:17:03,904 --> 01:17:05,623
About Reine.

587
01:17:06,821 --> 01:17:09,165
Love, nostalgia ...

588
01:17:10,237 --> 01:17:14,664
A 35 year old male was shot today
in a cabin area.

589
01:17:15,487 --> 01:17:20,644
The man was taken to hospital.
His condition is not critical.

590
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:25,810
Police said that shooting might
be linked to...

591
01:17:26,613 --> 01:17:31,738
...murders in the suburbs Enskede
and G�rdet, Stockholm.

592
01:17:43,445 --> 01:17:46,518
We have a couple of traffic reports
from Radio Stockholm.

593
01:17:47,154 --> 01:17:51,289
Emergency vehicles are on their way
from S�dert�je to Sv�velsj�.

594
01:17:52,060 --> 01:17:55,279
We're asking all motorist to pay
extra attention.

595
01:18:05,696 --> 01:18:07,486
He has agreed to meet you.

596
01:18:07,946 --> 01:18:11,309
But if he doesn't like you,
he'll throw you out on your ass.

597
01:18:11,987 --> 01:18:15,684
And you can't interview him
or write anything in the media.

598
01:18:27,319 --> 01:18:31,528
Who are you calling yourself
Lisbeth's friend?

599
01:18:32,319 --> 01:18:34,508
My name is Mikael Blomkvist.

600
01:18:35,029 --> 01:18:37,810
I know you've been bothered
by journalists,

601
01:18:38,404 --> 01:18:41,143
but I'm not here for an interview.

602
01:18:41,736 --> 01:18:43,819
I'm here for Lisbeth.

603
01:18:47,153 --> 01:18:50,956
I don't think she's got anything to do
with those murders.

604
01:18:51,695 --> 01:18:54,840
I believe a man named Zalachenko
is behind them.

605
01:19:01,362 --> 01:19:03,038
Sit down.

606
01:19:07,278 --> 01:19:08,850
Zalachenko.

607
01:19:10,944 --> 01:19:15,007
- Alexander Zalachenko.
- You know who he is?

608
01:19:17,862 --> 01:19:20,164
He's Lisbeth's father.

609
01:19:41,778 --> 01:19:43,746
Lisbeth's mother, her name was...

610
01:19:44,235 --> 01:19:46,277
...Agneta Sj�lander.

611
01:19:47,903 --> 01:19:52,590
She was only 17 years old
when Zalachenko met her.

612
01:19:53,976 --> 01:19:56,902
When Lisbeth was born,

613
01:19:57,528 --> 01:20:00,924
her mother changed her name

614
01:20:01,611 --> 01:20:04,788
from Sj�lander to Salander.

615
01:20:05,434 --> 01:20:07,329
Zala... Salander.

616
01:20:11,318 --> 01:20:14,131
Zalachenko was seldom home.

617
01:20:14,726 --> 01:20:18,892
But he showed up in between
at the apartment in Lundagatan.

618
01:20:20,902 --> 01:20:24,891
He got drunk,
abused the mother.

619
01:20:25,653 --> 01:20:29,965
Forced her to have sex.
Then he disappeared.

620
01:20:30,778 --> 01:20:34,330
This happened dozens of times.

621
01:20:35,027 --> 01:20:39,266
The municipality should have intervened,
but they did nothing.

622
01:20:41,194 --> 01:20:44,892
Not until 1993.

623
01:20:47,860 --> 01:20:49,871
What happened then?

624
01:20:54,652 --> 01:20:57,360
Attempted murder. She tried to kill
her father with a fire bomb.

625
01:20:57,944 --> 01:21:00,902
Lisbeth was 12 years old.

626
01:21:02,443 --> 01:21:05,953
Zalachenko laughed
when Lisbeth found her mother...

627
01:21:06,651 --> 01:21:09,069
...unconscious on the kitchen floor.

628
01:21:10,402 --> 01:21:14,464
He went out and got in his car,
but Lisbeth ran after him...

629
01:21:15,225 --> 01:21:20,642
...and threw a milk carton
filled with gasoline into the car.

630
01:21:29,110 --> 01:21:31,526
A man burns like a torch.

631
01:21:35,651 --> 01:21:37,515
My God.

632
01:21:37,984 --> 01:21:42,298
And this time
it had consequences.

633
01:21:43,109 --> 01:21:45,079
Lisbeth was taken...

634
01:21:45,568 --> 01:21:49,298
...and ended up in a children's
psychiatric ward in Uppsala.

635
01:21:51,152 --> 01:21:54,776
Her mother was admitted to hospital
during those few years she had left.

636
01:21:57,484 --> 01:21:59,672
She never recovered.

637
01:22:02,318 --> 01:22:06,671
- About her having psychiatric problems...
- Peter Teleborian.

638
01:22:07,485 --> 01:22:10,848
He got her admitted
to psychiatric care.

639
01:22:14,943 --> 01:22:20,213
On the other hand, her father,
Alexander Zalachenko, received no punishment.

640
01:22:22,891 --> 01:22:24,495
God damn ...

641
01:22:40,943 --> 01:22:42,223
Hello.

642
01:22:43,151 --> 01:22:46,473
Alexander Zalachenko.
Does the name tell you anything?

643
01:22:47,151 --> 01:22:51,839
- No. The press conference is about to start.
- He's Lisbeth Salander's father.

644
01:22:54,609 --> 01:22:57,275
She assaulted him
with a fire bomb in 1993,

645
01:22:57,859 --> 01:23:02,358
and the police investigated the matter.
Notice that it was the security police.

646
01:23:03,192 --> 01:23:06,516
- Why?
- Zalachenko worked for them.

647
01:23:07,193 --> 01:23:10,296
He could not be identified.
Officially he doesn't exist.

648
01:23:10,943 --> 01:23:14,411
- He's not listed in any public records.
- And how do you know this?

649
01:23:15,109 --> 01:23:18,911
You will go find the old case file,
if it's in there some place.

650
01:23:23,349 --> 01:23:26,640
I think it can lead us to Zalachenko.

651
01:23:27,984 --> 01:23:31,785
I'm convinced he's got something to do
with the murders in Enskede.

652
01:23:32,525 --> 01:23:35,816
Mostly likely the murder of
solicitor Bjurman as well.

653
01:23:36,483 --> 01:23:39,151
Contrary to Lisbeth Salander?

654
01:23:39,733 --> 01:23:44,015
- Her fingerprints are on the weapon.
- I know it sounds peculiar.

655
01:23:44,816 --> 01:23:48,442
Peculiar, indeed. Why are you
so interested in Lisbeth Salander?

656
01:23:49,149 --> 01:23:51,452
If she's innocent,
why won't she turn herself in?

657
01:23:51,984 --> 01:23:53,775
Lisbeth is...

658
01:23:57,316 --> 01:24:00,536
...a very private person.

659
01:24:01,192 --> 01:24:05,722
I don't like that you're constantly trying
to create a lead.

660
01:24:06,567 --> 01:24:10,484
We have enough problems. We'll solve
this case without private investigators.

661
01:24:25,524 --> 01:24:27,347
Welcome back.

662
01:24:31,608 --> 01:24:36,473
Paolo Roberto saved
Miriam from the flames.

663
01:24:43,608 --> 01:24:46,900
Do you still consider Lisbeth
a danger to her surroundings?

664
01:24:47,566 --> 01:24:50,743
She has shot a person.
She is armed.

665
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:54,066
Of course we'll capture her.

666
01:24:54,649 --> 01:24:57,430
Do you know who was behind
Miriam's kidnapping?

667
01:24:58,014 --> 01:25:01,483
We'll pass on that question to
lead investigator Bublanski.

668
01:25:02,181 --> 01:25:05,733
A man involved in
this morning's shooting incident

669
01:25:06,431 --> 01:25:11,077
was possibly the driver during a
previous kidnapping attempt.

670
01:25:11,941 --> 01:25:15,493
- The man who was shot?
- No comment.

671
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:21,242
The one abusing
Miriam Wu and Paolo Roberto...

672
01:25:21,972 --> 01:25:24,014
...left no traces.

673
01:25:24,525 --> 01:25:27,087
And you have no description of him?

674
01:25:27,649 --> 01:25:30,899
We've had this drawing made.

675
01:25:31,566 --> 01:25:35,035
It's based on witness descriptions.

676
01:25:35,733 --> 01:25:40,712
It's a large, muscular male
around 35-40 years old.

677
01:25:41,607 --> 01:25:45,483
Built like a body builder.
Short, blond hair.

678
01:25:46,233 --> 01:25:51,284
The drawing will be made available to everybody
after the press conference.

679
01:25:54,065 --> 01:25:59,440
Police informed that they have not
apprehended the 28 year old woman,

680
01:26:00,398 --> 01:26:04,940
which after the shooting incident
in the cabin area at Str�ngn�s

681
01:26:05,190 --> 01:26:07,908
fled the scene on a motorcycle.

682
01:26:08,606 --> 01:26:12,335
According to information available,
it may be gang related.

683
01:26:13,981 --> 01:26:16,357
They have no fucking clue!

684
01:26:18,482 --> 01:26:22,106
Bublanski didn't listen.
They are locked in on one single lead.

685
01:26:22,816 --> 01:26:26,586
If the police apprehends Lisbeth,
anything can happen.

686
01:26:27,315 --> 01:26:29,398
- Where are you going?
- Home.

687
01:26:29,899 --> 01:26:33,002
- Should I come with?
- No, I wouldn't be pleasant company at the moment.

688
01:26:33,648 --> 01:26:36,460
You don't have to be.

689
01:26:48,430 --> 01:26:50,992
And you, Teleborian,
are even more critical.

690
01:26:51,555 --> 01:26:55,940
You're calling it a scandal
that she did not receive treatment.

691
01:26:56,763 --> 01:27:00,232
I won't comment on individual cases.

692
01:27:00,930 --> 01:27:05,836
But I have to say that
certain complex cases...

693
01:27:06,732 --> 01:27:09,180
...require qualified treatment.

694
01:27:09,732 --> 01:27:13,242
I can only say I'm sorry
that three people lost their lives

695
01:27:13,940 --> 01:27:18,107
as a result of the budgetary cuts
in psychiatric care.

696
01:27:18,898 --> 01:27:21,345
So this woman should be locked up?

697
01:27:24,647 --> 01:27:27,648
There are patients
who should be institutionalized

698
01:27:28,273 --> 01:27:31,784
instead of moving around
freely in society.

699
01:28:04,272 --> 01:28:06,502
I know who Zalachenko is.

700
01:28:07,023 --> 01:28:10,126
I have talked to Palmgren
and understand Teleborian's part,

701
01:28:10,762 --> 01:28:14,231
and why you had to be locked up
in the children's psychiatric ward.

702
01:28:14,929 --> 01:28:17,189
I believe I know
who killed Dag and Mia.

703
01:28:17,730 --> 01:28:22,564
But I don't understand Bjurman's part in this.
Turn yourself in, we can solve this.

704
01:28:59,314 --> 01:29:01,658
Thank you for being my friend.

705
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:27,990
It's me.

706
01:29:28,970 --> 01:29:30,281
Okay.

707
01:29:42,470 --> 01:29:44,730
Did he look like this?

708
01:29:46,354 --> 01:29:50,418
He was horrible.
A real monster.

709
01:29:59,313 --> 01:30:02,126
Fuck.
Fuck, I'm sorry.

710
01:30:04,730 --> 01:30:07,583
You're the one they were looking for.
But you know that?

711
01:30:10,897 --> 01:30:12,573
What have you done?

712
01:30:15,761 --> 01:30:19,416
Paolo said Blomkvist contacted him
to get to you.

713
01:30:21,895 --> 01:30:24,532
- What is there between you two?
- I have to go.

714
01:30:25,094 --> 01:30:28,718
- Where are you going?
- There is something I have to finish.

715
01:30:29,438 --> 01:30:30,896
What the fuck...?

716
01:30:41,729 --> 01:30:44,396
There was a lady in here.

717
01:30:44,969 --> 01:30:48,291
A short blonde, she left.

718
01:30:48,979 --> 01:30:51,978
I'll bring you something to help you sleep.
I'll be right back.

719
01:31:26,812 --> 01:31:29,667
I should've done it a long time ago.

720
01:31:57,104 --> 01:31:58,927
Inside. Inside!

721
01:32:00,894 --> 01:32:03,197
I want to see your records
of rented cars.

722
01:32:03,728 --> 01:32:06,582
- They are on the computer.
- Turn it on.

723
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:13,707
Come. Slowly.

724
01:32:20,979 --> 01:32:22,656
Open the closet.

725
01:32:24,644 --> 01:32:26,582
Give me your cell phone.

726
01:32:28,312 --> 01:32:31,707
Go inside the closet.
And I won't have to hurt you.

727
01:32:39,602 --> 01:32:44,248
- Where do you keep your rental contracts?
- In a folder on the shelf.

728
01:32:56,437 --> 01:32:59,989
I need to rent a car.
I'm leaving 10.000 here.

729
01:33:00,687 --> 01:33:02,291
You will get your car back.

730
01:33:31,978 --> 01:33:34,978
Thank you for being my friend.

731
01:33:48,935 --> 01:33:52,258
Hello, it's Miriam, Miriam Wu.

732
01:33:53,603 --> 01:33:56,415
Can you stop by the hospital?

733
01:33:58,894 --> 01:34:02,696
- So she's been here? When?
- A few hours ago.

734
01:34:03,436 --> 01:34:05,810
Did she say where she was going?

735
01:34:09,018 --> 01:34:11,175
No, Lisbeth doesn't do that.

736
01:34:11,686 --> 01:34:15,310
If she tracks down that monster,
he'll kill her.

737
01:34:19,894 --> 01:34:22,049
Here. She forgot these.

738
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:25,080
- Forgot?
- No, she dropped them.

739
01:34:25,643 --> 01:34:28,092
They fell out of her backpack.

740
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:32,195
I have no idea where she lives.
Do you?

741
01:34:37,101 --> 01:34:41,165
- What is it?
- Looks like a PO Box key.

742
01:35:01,184 --> 01:35:03,924
- Can you use this?
- Yes please.

743
01:36:34,434 --> 01:36:35,892
Hello?

744
01:37:20,226 --> 01:37:21,725
Lisbeth?

745
01:38:00,517 --> 01:38:05,496
Gothenburg Traffic Radio. There's been
an accident on Grabov�gen, road F90.

746
01:38:06,391 --> 01:38:10,485
The accident has caused traffic jams,
and traffic is moving slowly.

747
01:38:16,766 --> 01:38:21,891
The social board in Biskopsgarden requests
support for measures against domestic violence.

748
01:38:25,266 --> 01:38:27,683
It's most certainly called an apple core.

749
01:38:28,224 --> 01:38:30,640
Back to pretensions.

750
01:38:31,183 --> 01:38:36,194
In retrospect, what is the
most pretentious work you have written?

751
01:39:34,931 --> 01:39:39,359
This picture is 17 years old.
His name is Ronald Niederman.

752
01:39:40,181 --> 01:39:43,692
He was 18 when he was caught
so today he's 35.

753
01:39:44,390 --> 01:39:47,390
- Where did you get the picture?
- Dynamic in Hamburg.

754
01:39:48,016 --> 01:39:51,964
Like I told Micke, he's not worth
jack shit as a boxer.

755
01:39:52,723 --> 01:39:56,859
But he moved like a boxer,
so somebody must've coached him.

756
01:39:57,641 --> 01:40:00,890
I e-mailed several boxing gyms
in Europe.

757
01:40:01,557 --> 01:40:05,255
Told them what had happened
and tried to describe him.

758
01:40:06,807 --> 01:40:10,431
He has an illness.
He was born with analgesia.

759
01:40:12,224 --> 01:40:15,370
- What is that?
- I looked it up. Genetic error.

760
01:40:16,015 --> 01:40:19,265
The nerve synapses do not work.
You feel no pain.

761
01:40:57,056 --> 01:40:59,139
- Yes?
- Hi, this is Malin.

762
01:40:59,640 --> 01:41:02,379
Paolo has identified the blond.

763
01:41:02,973 --> 01:41:04,764
Good.

764
01:41:05,223 --> 01:41:08,692
- Where are you?
- It's a bit hard to say.

765
01:41:09,390 --> 01:41:12,024
- You sound strange.
- What did you say?

766
01:41:12,598 --> 01:41:15,483
Paolo knows who the
blond boxer is.

767
01:41:16,097 --> 01:41:19,389
- His name is Niederman.
- Great. Do you have the address?

768
01:41:21,097 --> 01:41:24,900
All we have is a 17 year old picture
from Hamburg, Germany.

769
01:41:27,098 --> 01:41:29,108
Hello? Micke?

770
01:41:29,597 --> 01:41:32,816
Try to find him in the phone book.
I'm on my cell phone. Good bye.

771
01:42:19,471 --> 01:42:21,774
Will you be good to me?

772
01:42:28,013 --> 01:42:31,930
Will you be good to me?
Then I'll be good to you.

773
01:42:35,722 --> 01:42:37,471
It's too late.

774
01:43:05,722 --> 01:43:08,753
Hello, it's Malin.
I think I have something now.

775
01:43:09,388 --> 01:43:12,856
There is no Niederman
in Sweden's public records.

776
01:43:13,554 --> 01:43:17,325
But in '98 a shareholder company
was registered...

777
01:43:18,054 --> 01:43:20,356
...called KKAB Import.

778
01:43:20,888 --> 01:43:25,722
The chairman of the board is named
Karl Axel Bodin, born in 1944.

779
01:43:26,597 --> 01:43:30,440
Third member of the board is
a man named R. Niederman.

780
01:43:31,180 --> 01:43:33,222
- Do you have an address?
- Yes.

781
01:43:33,721 --> 01:43:36,753
Karl Axel Bodin
is registered in Western Sweden -

782
01:43:37,388 --> 01:43:41,597
with address PO Box 612
in Gosseberga.

783
01:43:52,013 --> 01:43:54,503
Neat...

784
01:43:57,304 --> 01:43:59,794
- Erika?
- Hi. Where have you been?

785
01:44:00,346 --> 01:44:02,357
- Come!
- What is it?

786
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:12,805
We can't keep information from the police
in the middle of a murder investigation.

787
01:44:13,721 --> 01:44:18,107
That's not what we're doing.
I want to ask you for a favor.

788
01:44:20,846 --> 01:44:24,689
This is Bj�rck's report from 1993.

789
01:44:25,429 --> 01:44:28,315
It contains parts of
Bj�rck's and Teleborian's...

790
01:44:28,928 --> 01:44:31,012
...correspondence about Lisbeth.

791
01:44:31,513 --> 01:44:35,283
Can you make a copy of it and
send the originals to Bublanski?

792
01:44:36,012 --> 01:44:37,876
I'm leaving for Gothenburg.

793
01:44:38,345 --> 01:44:41,898
I want to find her before the police does,
and be there for her.

794
01:44:42,596 --> 01:44:44,679
I owe her that.

795
01:44:47,804 --> 01:44:52,116
Be careful!!
Mikael, really...

796
01:48:28,052 --> 01:48:29,583
Hello, father.

797
01:48:43,510 --> 01:48:46,291
- Yes?
- Bublanski and Modig is here.

798
01:48:46,884 --> 01:48:49,844
They just read the report
about Salander from '93.

799
01:48:52,134 --> 01:48:56,124
Now they want Bj�rck's address.
Can we give it to them?

800
01:48:56,885 --> 01:48:59,146
They can find it themselves.

801
01:48:59,676 --> 01:49:03,113
How hard can it be?
They're the fucking police.

802
01:49:04,842 --> 01:49:06,884
Let me speak to him.

803
01:49:08,092 --> 01:49:12,333
Blomkvist, I think it's best that you come
in and give us your witness statement.

804
01:49:13,134 --> 01:49:16,165
I have no time for it.
I'm not in Stockholm.

805
01:49:16,802 --> 01:49:18,333
Where are you?

806
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:22,384
Remember that I'm a private snoop and
I don't understand jack shit.

807
01:49:23,093 --> 01:49:26,749
Don't be childish.
I'm also doubting Salander's guilt.

808
01:49:28,135 --> 01:49:30,479
May I talk to Erika again?

809
01:49:32,551 --> 01:49:35,114
- Yes?
- Give them Bj�rck's address.

810
01:49:35,676 --> 01:49:39,186
I'm turning my cell phone off now.
I don't want to be traced. Good bye.

811
01:49:45,093 --> 01:49:47,614
You set off every alarm on the farm.

812
01:49:49,634 --> 01:49:51,645
Movement sensors?

813
01:50:01,551 --> 01:50:03,374
You look like shit.

814
01:50:07,676 --> 01:50:09,499
But you have my eyes...

815
01:50:14,051 --> 01:50:15,727
Are you in pain?

816
01:50:17,717 --> 01:50:18,810
No.

817
01:50:19,176 --> 01:50:21,593
I have given you some
thought over the years.

818
01:50:22,758 --> 01:50:26,050
About every time I look in the mirror.

819
01:50:26,718 --> 01:50:29,352
You should've left my mother alone.

820
01:50:29,926 --> 01:50:32,779
Your mother...
Your mother was a whore.

821
01:50:33,383 --> 01:50:37,405
No. She was a cashier and tried her best
to make ends meet.

822
01:50:38,176 --> 01:50:41,029
You can think what you want
about your mother.

823
01:50:41,633 --> 01:50:43,498
But she was a whore.

824
01:50:46,467 --> 01:50:48,259
I hated you.

825
01:50:53,133 --> 01:50:55,477
- But I have forgiven you.
- Bullshit!

826
01:50:56,008 --> 01:50:58,122
Bjurman hired you to kill me.

827
01:50:58,634 --> 01:51:02,727
That was a whole different matter.
That was business.

828
01:51:04,674 --> 01:51:07,488
You had a movie he wanted.

829
01:51:09,591 --> 01:51:12,519
And I'm running a small business.

830
01:51:17,759 --> 01:51:19,800
Did he really rape you?

831
01:51:23,675 --> 01:51:26,967
He must've had some
fucking bad taste in women.

832
01:51:30,967 --> 01:51:32,320
Sit!

833
01:51:32,716 --> 01:51:36,300
Sit down,
or I'll shoot you like a dog.

834
01:51:42,508 --> 01:51:47,154
- Where did you find that retard?
- You really haven't figured it out yet?

835
01:51:49,382 --> 01:51:53,153
They claimed you're a
really good researcher.

836
01:51:54,674 --> 01:51:56,716
Obviously not.

837
01:51:59,799 --> 01:52:01,696
He's your brother.

838
01:52:03,049 --> 01:52:07,215
- What?
- Correction, you half brother.

839
01:52:08,007 --> 01:52:11,925
The result of a recreational incident
a long time ago in Germany.

840
01:52:36,465 --> 01:52:39,758
Did Niederman shoot Bjurman as well?
Why?

841
01:52:41,590 --> 01:52:46,236
Bjurman was a moron.
He had papers that were mine.

842
01:52:47,091 --> 01:52:50,341
He was one of very few
who knew about my background.

843
01:52:51,007 --> 01:52:54,184
I could not trust that he
would keep his mouth shut.

844
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:58,279
Especially not when journalists began
meddling in our affairs.

845
01:52:58,965 --> 01:53:01,153
That was the drop.

846
01:53:01,674 --> 01:53:04,819
You made too many mistakes.
The police will identify you.

847
01:53:05,465 --> 01:53:08,133
Oh, I'm scared.

848
01:53:10,966 --> 01:53:13,341
No, I didn't shoot anyone.

849
01:53:13,881 --> 01:53:17,277
I'm just an old, wounded invalid.

850
01:53:23,256 --> 01:53:24,976
Ready?

851
01:53:58,132 --> 01:54:00,287
I should probably say something.

852
01:54:02,132 --> 01:54:04,798
But I have nothing to say to you.

853
01:54:05,382 --> 01:54:07,798
That's okay. Neither do I.

854
01:54:09,299 --> 01:54:10,870
Let's get it over with.

855
01:54:11,299 --> 01:54:16,131
Fortunately I managed to catch you red handed.
The police will come tonight.

856
01:54:17,007 --> 01:54:18,610
Bullshit!

857
01:54:19,757 --> 01:54:22,245
I was waiting for you to make a bluff.

858
01:54:24,298 --> 01:54:28,537
You came here to kill me.
You didn't talk to anyone.

859
01:54:29,340 --> 01:54:31,423
May I show you something?

860
01:54:40,381 --> 01:54:43,892
Everything you said the last hour
has been published online.

861
01:54:46,422 --> 01:54:47,954
May I see?

862
01:54:57,047 --> 01:55:00,443
No, this isn't one of those.

863
01:55:21,090 --> 01:55:22,661
Idiot!

864
01:55:27,714 --> 01:55:29,464
What are you waiting for?

865
02:00:05,377 --> 02:00:07,867
Come here! Come here!

866
02:03:17,875 --> 02:03:19,261
It's me.

867
02:03:22,167 --> 02:03:23,813
It's me.

868
02:03:31,584 --> 02:03:33,406
Lisbeth...

869
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:51,970
Thank you.

870
02:05:10,720 --> 02:05:13,529
