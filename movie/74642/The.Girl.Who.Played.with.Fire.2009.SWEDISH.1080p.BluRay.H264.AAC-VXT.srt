不 米娅侧重研究被卖的女孩

处于社会最低层

81
00:10:36,204 --> 00:10:38,005
完全得不到司法庇护
They're irrelevant to the justice system.

82
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:42,509
因此针对东欧少女的犯罪不会被优先处理

83

慢着

上次我没仔细验证证据

切记 我们是在以身涉险
We're poking our heads out with this case. We have to realize that.

100
00:11:52,346 --> 00:11:55,082
这可能也是千禧年的办社宗旨
That is supposedly the whole point of of Millennium?

101
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:59,753
这是我们相聚的理由 是的 欢迎加入千禧年

我不知道为什么不辞而别
I don't know why I didn't say goodbye.

116
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:26,433
因为你并不在乎别人
Because you don't really care about other people.

117
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:31,038
你把那些想成为你朋友的人当垃圾
You treat people trying to be your friends like shit.

118
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,708
就这么简单
It's that simple.

布罗姆科斯特一直在找你

你甚至连他的死活都不知道
You don't even know if he's dead or alive.

126

00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:03,197
事实如比
That's how it is.

131
00:16:09,903 --> 00:16:12,573
新监护人
How are things with the new...

132
00:16:14,842 --> 00:16:17,077
这么样
... guardian?

133
00:16:18,212 --> 00:16:20,180
彼尤曼
Bjurman.

134
00:16:20,614 --> 00:16:23,283
他还可以 不错
He's okay. It's okay.

135
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:26,987
你仍被强制接受监护人的监管吗
And you're still forced to be under the supervision of a guardian?

136
00:16:27,588 --> 00:16:29,957
别为我担心
Don't worry about me.

137
00:16:30,491 --> 00:16:33,460
我会处理的 不再关你的事了
I'll fix it. It's no longer your job.

138

139
00:16:36,697 --> 00:16:39,600
我只是个愚蠢的笨老头
I'm just a silly, old fool.

140
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:41,702
是 你是
Yes, you are.

141
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:45,038
如果你这么想 就真的很蠢
Truly silly, if that's what you think.

142
00:16:58,452 --> 00:17:01,488
你离开前我们没这么常见面
We didn't meet that often before you left.

143
00:17:02,122 --> 00:17:05,192
我很忙 你回来真好
I was busy. It's good to have you back.

144
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,328
我只认识一个人敢这样销声匿迹一年半
I only know one person who dares knock on the door

145
00:17:08,962 --> 00:17:12,599
还来问我是否想上床

149
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:23,610

A fantastic place.

150
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:27,181
但法学院接受了我的入学申请
But I had applied for law school, and been accepted.

151
00:17:27,781 --> 00:17:31,451
我母亲发现了邀请函说... 你要住我的公寓吗

彼尤曼 她的监护人

I want to present evidence. I want to point out an alternative killer

00:46:49,617 --> 00:46:50,110
为什么
why?

445
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,316
我不知道 我想她 她很漂亮
I don't know... I wanted her. she was beautiful.

446
00:46:58,285 --> 00:47:00,053
漂亮 是的 她很漂亮
Beautiful? Yes, she was beautiful.

447
00:47:00,487 --> 00:47:03,891
这就让你有权把她绑起来干她
And that gave you the right to tie her up and fuck her?

448
00:47:13,634 --> 00:47:16,904
你是个粗暴的猪和强奸犯
You are a sadistic pig and a rapist.

449
00:47:18,806 --> 00:47:20,407
不是吗
Isn't that so?

450
00:47:34,488 --> 00:47:36,323
萨拉是谁
Who is Zala?

451
00:47:38,258 --> 00:47:40,928
我不知道 别浪费你的机会
I don't know. Don't abuse your chance.

452
00:47:41,528 --> 00:47:43,028
我不知道他是谁
I don't know who he is.

453
00:47:43,029 --> 00:47:45,466
那个被你枪杀的记者也问起他
The journalist you shot asked about him as well.

454
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,735
如果我知道肯定会告诉你
If I knew I would tell you.

455
00:47:49,336 --> 00:47:51,905
我只和某个说他名叫萨拉的人说过话
I only spoke to some who said his name was Zala.

456
00:47:52,506 --> 00:47:55,275
只在电话里谈了一分钟 为什么
One minute on the phone. why?

457
00:47:55,943 --> 00:47:59,246
我本该从塔林弄进一车的安非他命
I was supposed to import a car with amphetamine from Tallinn.

458
00:47:59,913 --> 00:48:01,448
我不想干
I didn't want to.

459
00:48:01,949 --> 00:48:06,587
他们几天后来说不让我退出
They showed up a few days later and told me I couldn't pull out.

460
00:48:07,454 --> 00:48:09,957
于是他们强迫我和他们一起去
Then they forced me to come with them to...

461
00:48:11,859 --> 00:48:14,795
哪儿 某个仓库
To? Some storage facility.

462
00:48:15,462 --> 00:48:18,710
我第一眼看见的是个人躺在地板上
The first thing I saw was a man on the floor,

463
00:48:18,711 --> 00:48:19,666
都被打烂了
beaten to a pulp.

464
00:48:21,635 --> 00:48:23,837
他就在那儿 谁 萨拉
And he was there... who? zala?

465
00:48:24,371 --> 00:48:28,375
不是 一个金发混蛋 肌肉男
No, a blond fucker. pure muscle.

466
00:48:29,176 --> 00:48:32,045
我之前只见过他一次 妈的
I've only seen him once before. damn.

467
00:48:32,679 --> 00:48:35,282
他叫什么 不知道
What's his name? I don't know.

468
00:48:37,651 --> 00:48:39,620
还有什么
What else happened?

469
00:48:40,087 --> 00:48:43,090
他们说地板上那人是个告密者
They said the guy on the floor was a snitch.

470
00:48:43,757 --> 00:48:47,828
金发男在我面前把他抬到椅子上
The blonde raised him up on a chair in front of me.

471
00:48:48,595 --> 00:48:52,533
然后手绕过他脖子
Then he put his hands around his neck.

472
00:48:55,302 --> 00:48:57,704
我听到他脖子咔咔作响
I heard his neck cracking.

473
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,577
他就在我面前死了
He died before my eyes.

474
00:49:08,115 --> 00:49:12,119
后来金发男的手又绕着我的脖子
Then the blonde wrapped his hands around my neck.

475
00:49:13,554 --> 00:49:16,360
麦吉拿着电话放在我耳边
Magge held a phone to my ear

476
00:49:16,361 --> 00:49:18,792
说萨拉要和我说话
and told me Zala wanted to speak to me.

477
00:49:19,693 --> 00:49:22,329
他说了什么 萨拉
What did he say? Zala?

478
00:49:24,832 --> 00:49:29,203
我只能听命 还能有什么选择
I was to do as I was told. What choice did I have?

479
00:49:31,905 --> 00:49:33,407
有人吗
Hello.

480
00:50:22,656 --> 00:50:26,126
我们得回去了 我还有个午餐会
We have to get back. I have a lunch meeting.

481
00:50:40,841 --> 00:50:43,377
和她联系上了吗
Have you been in contact with her?

482
00:50:45,112 --> 00:50:46,747
谁
Who?

483
00:50:49,516 --> 00:50:51,718
你以为是谁
Who do you think?

484
00:50:53,787 --> 00:50:57,825
早上有个老朋友来电
An old friend called this morning.

485
00:50:58,592 --> 00:51:02,529
他也确信丽莎白斯·萨兰德是无罪的
He's also convinced Lisbeth Salander is innocent.

486
00:51:03,297 --> 00:51:05,699
谁 全扣错了
Who? That's completely skewed.

487
00:51:07,468 --> 00:51:09,403
伊利卡
Erika?

488
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:14,908
你们最好面谈
It's best if you meet and discuss it yourselves.

489
00:51:18,378 --> 00:51:21,281
出拳 波罗 上 给他一拳
Jab, Paolo! Come on! Give him a jab!

490
00:51:24,718 --> 00:51:28,422
移动 伙计 注意步伐 加油
Move your feet, man. concentrate on your foot work. come on!

491
00:51:29,123 --> 00:51:30,924
别放弃
Don't give up.

492
00:51:33,093 --> 00:51:35,129
你怎么认识丽莎白斯的
From where do you know Lisbeth?

493
00:51:35,662 --> 00:51:37,931
从她17岁起我们就一起打拳了
We've boxed together since she was 17.

494
00:51:38,432 --> 00:51:43,303
不在同一个重量级 她很厉害的
Not in the same weight class. She's quite tough.

495
00:51:48,542 --> 00:51:50,711
她遇到麻烦了 对吗
She's in trouble, yes?

496
00:52:03,957 --> 00:52:07,995
超级大麻烦 波罗 你得帮我
She's in deep deep trouble. Paolo, you have to help me.

497
00:52:08,796 --> 00:52:11,195
我要联系丽莎白斯的女友
I need to get in touch with Lisbeth's girlfriend,

498
00:52:11,196 --> 00:52:12,332
米里亚姆·吴
Miriam Wu.

499
00:52:13,033 --> 00:52:14,330
你知道她吗
Have you read about her?

500
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:16,370
我认识她 踢拳手
I know her. Kick boxer.

501
00:52:17,037 --> 00:52:20,507
她不和我谈因为我是记者
She refuses to talk to me because I'm a journalist.

502
00:52:21,175 --> 00:52:24,545
如果作为相熟的拳手 你和她谈谈
If you, as a known boxer, talk to her...

503
00:52:25,179 --> 00:52:28,348
试着通过她联系到丽莎白斯
And try to reach Lisbeth through her?

504
00:53:39,453 --> 00:53:41,955
操 来啊
Fuck...! come on!

505
00:54:25,432 --> 00:54:29,203
米克 你让我去深挖古纳·彼尤曼的过去
Mmicke? you asked me to dig into Gunnar Bjurman's past.

506
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:32,339
我偶然查到尼尔斯·彼尤曼
I ran into Nils Bjurman.

507
00:54:32,873 --> 00:54:36,343
他曾是国家警察局安保部门的官员。
He was an officer in the security department of the national police force.

508
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:39,123

What? when was that?

509
00:54:39,124 --> 00:54:40,180
76到78年
From 76 until 78.

510
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:47,154
与彼尤曼同一时间 妈的
Same time as Bjurman. Fuck...!

511
00:56:32,493 --> 00:56:34,661
她在哪儿 谁
Where is she? Who?

512
00:56:35,195 --> 00:56:38,165
丽莎白斯·萨兰德 我说过 不知道
Lisbeth Salander. I told you, I don't know!

513
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:40,801
回答错误
Wrong answer.

514
00:56:46,306 --> 00:56:49,676
你还有一次机会 然后我就上这个了
You have one more chance. Then I'll start using this.

515

516
01:01:24,118 --> 01:01:26,653
你好 米克 我是波罗

517
01:01:27,254 --> 01:01:30,157
我和米里亚姆·吴在医院
I'm at the hospital with Miriam Wu.

518
01:01:30,791 --> 01:01:33,360
什么 你最好能来一下
What? Would be nice if you could come by.

519
01:01:53,914 --> 01:01:55,429
我没枪杀道格和米娅
I didn't shoot Dag and Mia.

520
01:01:55,430 --> 01:01:57,160
如果你想帮忙 找到萨拉
If you want to help, find Zala,

521
01:01:57,161 --> 01:01:57,918
丽莎白斯
Lisbeth.

522
01:02:12,433 --> 01:02:14,668
我揍别人 也挨揍
I can give and receive punches.

523
01:02:15,235 --> 01:02:18,238
可他不是普通人
But he was no ordinary human.

524
01:02:18,839 --> 01:02:19,840
他长什么样
What did he look like?

525
01:02:19,841 --> 01:02:22,843
金发 像装甲机器人
A blonde, armour penetrating robot.

526
01:02:23,677 --> 01:02:25,049
一身肌肉
He was pure muscle.

527
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:26,880
你以前从没见过他
And you never saw him before?

528
01:02:27,548 --> 01:02:30,584
没有 他步伐像拳击手
Never. He moved exactly like a boxer.

529
01:02:31,151 --> 01:02:32,802
始终保持防守
He kept his guard up,

530
01:02:32,803 --> 01:02:34,755
可同时又似乎完全没章法
but at the same time seemed completely clueless.

531
01:02:35,422 --> 01:02:37,816
怎么没章法 嗑药了
Clueless in what way? On drugs?

532
01:02:37,817 --> 01:02:39,093
不是 是很奇怪
No, it was very strange.

533
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:43,363
就像受过训练 但从不听教练的话
As if he had trained, but never listened to his coach!

534
01:02:47,634 --> 01:02:50,370
然后还有他妈更吓人的
And then there was something fucking scary.

535
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:55,409
我用力击打他的身体 正中无数拳
I hit him rock hard. About 100 punches went straight in.

536
01:02:56,110 --> 01:02:59,913
但毫无效果 他就像没知觉
But nothing happened. As if he didn't feel anything.

537
01:03:02,349 --> 01:03:04,595
你好 1B病房在哪
Hello. ward 1B?

538
01:03:04,596 --> 01:03:05,719
走廊继续往里
Further down the hall.

539
01:03:06,453 --> 01:03:08,155
詹·巴兰斯基
Jan Bublanski.

540
01:03:09,323 --> 01:03:11,792
你好吗 好极了
How are you? Splendid.

541
01:03:16,263 --> 01:03:19,533
找个没人打扰的地方谈话
I'll find a place where we can talk uninterrupted.

542
01:03:23,036 --> 01:03:26,406
米里亚姆·吴怎样了 还在给她做检查
How are Miriam Wu? they're still examining her.

543
01:03:27,141 --> 01:03:29,743
她和我一样 他们要找的不是她
She looks like me. It wasn't her they were after.

544
01:03:30,344 --> 01:03:32,780
而是丽莎白斯·萨兰德
It was Lisbeth Salander.

545
01:03:33,347 --> 01:03:35,732
我们已经从道格的名单上
We have identified

546
01:03:35,733 --> 01:03:38,118
确认了29名嫖客和皮条客
29 customers and pimps from dag's list.

547
01:03:39,052 --> 01:03:42,956
理论上说他们都有杀道格的动机
In theory, they all had a motive to murder Dag.

548
01:03:43,724 --> 01:03:48,662
还缺8个名字 我们起了假名
Eight names are missing. we've given them pseudonyms.

549
01:03:49,496 --> 01:03:52,633
我们要怎么做 马琳试着指认他们
What are we doing about them? Malin is trying to identify them.

550
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:56,403
一些假名米娅在论文里提到过
Some of the pseudonyms are mentioned in Mia's dissertation.

551
01:03:57,070 --> 01:04:01,308
我们可以参考下 也许能找到真名
We can find references there which can lead to the names.

552
01:04:02,042 --> 01:04:06,246
我先去拜访那些道格想揭露的人
First I'd like to visit the Dag wanted to expose.

553
01:04:07,047 --> 01:04:11,051
他们是最有可能的 然后我们就可以跟进了
They have the most to lose. Then we can do the following.

554
01:04:13,587 --> 01:04:16,256
斯坦·福斯特 搞定
Sten Falstre done. he's done.

555
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:19,660
卡尔·皮特森 搞定 皮埃尔·桑德斯特
Karl Petersson, done. Perier Sandstre

556
01:04:20,294 --> 01:04:23,363
他和道格见过面了 所以我们曝光他
He's been confronted by Dag, so we'll expose him.

557
01:04:23,964 --> 01:04:26,733
还有反间谍机关那个家伙 彼尤曼
And the guy from the security police force? Bjurman?

558
01:04:27,334 --> 01:04:31,071
他和彼尤曼有什么联系 和萨拉呢
What about the connection between him and bjurman? what about this zala?

559
01:04:31,872 --> 01:04:34,842
我和彼尤曼还没彻底结束呢
I'm not completely finished with Bjurman.

560
01:04:50,624 --> 01:04:51,709
我是彼尤曼
It's Bjurman.

561
01:04:51,710 --> 01:04:53,761
我是布罗姆科斯特 你没给我打电话
Blomkvist here. You never called.

562
01:04:54,461 --> 01:04:55,963
你要干嘛
What do you want?

563
01:04:56,430 --> 01:04:59,933
你说谎了 你和彼尤曼一起工作
You lied to me. You and Bjurman worked together.

564
01:05:00,667 --> 01:05:04,538
为什么我要告诉你和谁工作过
Why would I tell you who I worked with?

565
01:05:05,305 --> 01:05:06,810
明天我会召开
Tomorrow I'm holding a press

566
01:05:06,810 --> 01:05:09,443
关于道格和米娅的谋杀案新闻发布会

567
01:05:10,244 --> 01:05:13,514
我会发布性交易系列报道里的细节

568
01:05:14,181 --> 01:05:16,717
而你是唯一我要曝光的嫖客
And you're the only customer I'll expose.

569
01:05:17,284 --> 01:05:19,820
所以你会有机会发表评论
So you'll have the opportunity to comment.

570
01:05:20,421 --> 01:05:23,657
你想毁了我的生活 我为什么要和你谈
You want to destroy my life. Why would I talk to you?

571
01:05:24,291 --> 01:05:27,661
因为你认识彼尤曼 有可能也认识萨拉
Since you know Bjurman, you probably know Zala as well?

572
01:05:29,496 --> 01:05:30,964
喂
Hello?

573
01:05:34,735 --> 01:05:37,037

01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:42,509
那消息对你有多重要
What is that information worth to you?

575
01:05:58,792 --> 01:06:02,262
他的真名叫做萨拉千古 但大家都叫他萨拉
His real name is Zalachenko, but he's called Zala.

576
01:06:06,967 --> 01:06:10,537
我现在要告诉你的是最高机密
What I'm about to tell you now is top secret.

577
01:06:11,205 --> 01:06:15,876
你明白对我最重要的是你要保密
You understand it's important to me that you guarantee source protection.

578
01:06:16,710 --> 01:06:18,746
我已经做了
I've already done that.

579
01:06:19,213 --> 01:06:23,250
萨拉千古生于1940年的苏联
Zalachenko was born in 1940 in what was then the soviet union.

580
01:06:24,051 --> 01:06:25,608
战争中父母双亡
Both parents died during the war.

581
01:06:25,609 --> 01:06:28,722
我想你应该知道苏军总参谋部情报总局吧
I assume you know what GRU was?

582
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:32,760
是的 军情部门

583
01:06:33,427 --> 01:06:37,331
他在那儿工作 精通6种语言

是伪装和生存技能的专家

585
01:06:42,469 --> 01:06:44,972
过去几年来他变得越来越堕落
Over the years he became more and more corrupt.

586
01:06:45,506 --> 01:06:49,410
GRU从马德里的大使馆派出一名军情联系员
Gru sent a military attach

587
01:06:50,177 --> 01:06:54,114
去寻找他
From the embassy in Madrid to find him 

588
01:06:54,848 --> 01:06:56,950
并规劝他
And correct his ways.

589
01:06:59,086 --> 01:07:02,790
交谈不愉快
Something went wrong during that conversation.

590
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:08,662
说直接点
Cut to the chase.

591
01:07:11,465 --> 01:07:14,201
萨拉千古杀死了使馆的人
Zalachenko killed the man from the embassy.

592
01:07:15,736 --> 01:07:18,338
他意识到无路可退
He realized he had burned all bridges,

593
01:07:18,872 --> 01:07:22,109
去了瑞典 联系反间谍人员申请庇护
Went to sweden, contacted the security police and applied for asylum.

594
01:07:23,243 --> 01:07:26,180
然后呢 你说政府的反应
And? The actions of the government?

595
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:30,317
当一个苏联顶级间谍申请避难
When a soviet top spy applies for asylum?

596
01:07:31,085 --> 01:07:35,456
从未有主管因GRU的一名间谍精英落难瑞典
Never before had an operation's chief for one of gru's elite commands 

597
01:07:37,558 --> 01:07:39,293
而有所动作
Desserted to sweden

598
01:07:39,693 --> 01:07:41,662
所以他留下来了 是的
So he could stay? Yes.

599
01:07:42,196 --> 01:07:45,599
开始为你工作 他是一座金矿
And started working for you? He was a gold mine.

600
01:07:46,266 --> 01:07:50,137
我们给他瑞典身份 护照和钱
We gave him a swedish identity, a passport and some money.

601
01:07:50,871 --> 01:07:52,973
从那时起 他自生自灭
From then on he managed on his own.

602
01:07:53,507 --> 01:07:57,010
作为回报 他提供了很多有利情报
In return we received good favors for the information he provided us.

603
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:06,620
彼尤曼呢 他怎么卷进来了
What about Bjurman? where does he enter the picture?

604
01:08:07,254 --> 01:08:08,822
彼尤曼
Bjurman...

605
01:08:09,289 --> 01:08:12,426
我们那时很年轻 多大 25 30
We were young back then. what were we? 25? 30?

606
01:08:13,026 --> 01:08:17,431
没资格处理萨拉千古这样的人
Not really qualified to handle someone like Zalachenko.

607
01:08:19,433 --> 01:08:22,836
他在76年选举日来找我们
He came to us on election day in 76.

608
01:08:23,470 --> 01:08:26,407
警察局连个鬼影都没有
Hardly a soul to be found at the police station.

609
01:08:27,074 --> 01:08:30,911
每个人都休假或是忙于选举的事
Everybody had time off or were busy with the election.

610
01:08:31,678 --> 01:08:33,180
我是当时的负责人
I was the officer in charge,

611
01:08:33,180 --> 01:08:35,849
把他当做普通移民事务来办
And considered it a common immigration matter.

612
01:08:36,617 --> 01:08:39,753
我让彼尤曼作为社工参加
I brought Bjurman as caseworker.

613
01:08:40,421 --> 01:08:44,124
他后来的参与完全是偶然
His further involvement was completely random.

614
01:08:44,892 --> 01:08:47,761
偶然 是的 确实是
Random? Yes, actually.

615
01:08:48,362 --> 01:08:49,997
普罗瓦克戴尔
Praktvindel.

616
01:08:51,598 --> 01:08:53,667
什么 这植物的名字
What? That's what it's called.

617
01:08:57,571 --> 01:09:00,407
萨拉千古现在在哪 不知道
Where is Zalachenko today? I don't know.

618
01:09:00,974 --> 01:09:04,711
办他的案子直到1985年 后来我接到了其他任务
I had his case until 1985. I then received other tasks.

619
01:09:09,583 --> 01:09:12,986
你给他新的身份和瑞典名字 是什么
You gave him a new identity and a Wwedish name. What is it?

620
01:09:13,654 --> 01:09:15,956
不能告诉你 说吧
That I won't tell you. Come on.

621
01:09:16,457 --> 01:09:18,459
你想知道谁是萨拉
You wanted to know who Zala is.

622
01:09:18,992 --> 01:09:21,495
确信你遵守承诺我才说更多
I'm not saying more until I know you're true to your word.

623
01:09:22,129 --> 01:09:23,894
我相信萨拉千古涉嫌三起谋杀
I believe Zalachenko committed three murders,

624
01:09:23,894 --> 01:09:25,699
而警察通缉错了人
And the police is hunting the wrong person.

625
01:09:26,433 --> 01:09:28,652
为什么萨兰德不是凶手 
Why isn't Salander the murderer?

626
01:09:28,653 --> 01:09:30,237
我相信是萨拉千古做的
I believe Zalachenko did it.

627
01:09:31,004 --> 01:09:32,840
你错了
You are mistaken.

628
01:09:33,307 --> 01:09:37,010
萨拉没有杀任何人 他69岁了而且有点残疾
Zala has not murdered anyone. He's 69 and somewhat disabled.

629
01:09:37,745 --> 01:09:41,849
走路拄拐 他不可能东奔西跑杀人的
Walks around on crutches. He's not been running around shooting people.

630
01:09:42,616 --> 01:09:46,286
如果他想犯案 还得让福利机构开车送他
If he wants to commit murder, he'll have to order welfare transport.

631
01:09:46,987 --> 01:09:49,823
希望在你的报道里不会看到我的名字
I hope I won't have to see my name in your paper now.

632
01:11:51,044 --> 01:11:53,080
你想要多少
What do you want for it?

633
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:56,950
一半 20万现金
Half. 200000. cash.

01:12:15,235 --> 01:12:16,837
你什么意思
What do you mean?

639
01:12:17,371 --> 01:12:20,641
彼尤曼的仓库 你应该烧成平地
Bjurman's retreat, you were supposed to burn it to the ground.

连你小女友都不知道你在哪儿
Not even your little girlfriend knew where you were.

648
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:56,430

我觉得她和那些谋杀无关
I don't think she's got anything to do with those murders.

我相信事件的主谋是个叫萨拉千古的人

坐下

Does the name tell you anything?

718
01:22:47,835 --> 01:22:50,490
没 记者招待会要开始了
No. The press conference is about to start.

719
01:22:50,490 --> 01:22:52,639
他是丽莎白斯·萨兰德的父亲

她在1993年用燃烧弹袭击了他

注意是秘密警察
Make a note it was the security police.

723
01:23:03,951 --> 01:23:07,254
为什么 萨拉千古为他们工作

724
01:23:07,921 --> 01:23:10,991
他不可能被指认 官方来讲他是不存在的
He could not be identified. Officially he doesn't exist.

725
01:23:11,658 --> 01:23:14,072
他没有任何公共记录

731
01:23:37,151 --> 01:23:39,887
不是丽莎白斯·萨兰德

01:23:40,487 --> 01:23:44,792
凶器上有她的指纹 我知道这听起来很荒诞
Her fingerprints are on the weapon. I know it sounds peculiar.

733
01:23:45,592 --> 01:23:46,553
的确是荒诞

就等着你虚张声势呢

01:54:24,998 --> 01:54:29,236
你是来杀我的 你谁都没有告诉
You came here to kill me. You didn't talk to anyone.

953
01:54:30,037 --> 01:54:32,139
能给你看样东西吗
May I show you something?

954
