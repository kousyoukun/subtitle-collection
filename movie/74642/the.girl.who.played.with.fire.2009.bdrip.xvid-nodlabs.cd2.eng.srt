1
00:00:04,362 --> 00:00:13,532
No GRU senior officer had
ever defected to Sweden before.

2
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:17,604
So he was allowed to stay.
And he worked for you.

3
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:23,977
He was a gold mine.
He received a Swedish identity,

4
00:00:24,282 --> 00:00:26,773
a passport, some money,
and he took care of himself.

5
00:00:27,552 --> 00:00:31,784
We used his
information to get favors.

6
00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:41,120
Where does Bjurman fit in?

7
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:47,332
Well, we were young back then.
25, 30...

8
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:53,067
Completely unqualified to take care
of a man like Zalachenko.

9
00:00:54,245 --> 00:00:57,703
He showed up on election day,

10
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:03,416
in Police Headquarters
was practically empty...

11
00:01:04,055 --> 00:01:06,546
Nearly everyone
was out on special duty.

12
00:01:07,058 --> 00:01:12,997
I was on call, and I thought
he was an ordinary refugee.

13
00:01:13,498 --> 00:01:19,562
So I brought Bjurman along
to manage the paperwork.

14
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:22,533
- Bjurman got involved by accident.
- By accident?

15
00:01:23,441 --> 00:01:25,500
Morning Glory...

16
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:29,172
That's what it's called.

17
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:38,288
- Where is Zalachenko?
- I was only his contact until 1985.

18
00:01:38,456 --> 00:01:40,924
After that,
I was assigned to other duties.

19
00:01:44,695 --> 00:01:50,861
- What's his Swedish name?
- I won't reveal that.

20
00:01:51,035 --> 00:01:56,632
I've told you who Zala is
and that's all you get.

21
00:01:56,908 --> 00:02:00,935
He's committed three murders,
the police are on the wrong track.

22
00:02:01,112 --> 00:02:03,740
Why are you so sure Salander
didn't do it?

23
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:06,577
- I believe Zalachenko did it.
- You're wrong.

24
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:12,781
Zala is 69,
and severely handicapped.

25
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:17,450
The guy needs a cane, so he can't
exactly run around shooting people.

26
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:21,630
He'd need to call a mobility service
to get to his victims.

27
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:24,828
I hope I won't
be seeing my name in the papers.

28
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,384
All right, how much?

29
00:04:28,793 --> 00:04:32,354
Half.
200 grand. In cash.

30
00:04:35,766 --> 00:04:39,258
- I'll have to go get the money.
- When?

31
00:04:40,104 --> 00:04:43,073
- We can do it right now.
- I'll do it.

32
00:04:44,942 --> 00:04:49,402
By the way, how did it go?

33
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,910
- What do you mean?
- The summer house.

34
00:04:53,784 --> 00:04:57,151
Bjurman's place
You were going to torch it.

35
00:04:58,222 --> 00:05:02,591
We were just about...
We haven't gotten around to it yet.

36
00:05:03,661 --> 00:05:04,923
You haven't?

37
00:05:05,296 --> 00:05:07,821
We'll do it now.
And get your money.

38
00:05:08,065 --> 00:05:11,000
We'll be back with the money
in a little while, okay?

39
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,077
I'll wait right here.

40
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,752
Shit, if it isn't
that Salander bitch...

41
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:24,067
We've been looking all over for you.

42
00:07:25,136 --> 00:07:27,764
Not even that dyke
knew where you were.

43
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,203
At least that's what she said.

44
00:07:31,108 --> 00:07:34,043
- Isn't that so, Magge?
- Well, I'll be damned.

45
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,647
She looks like she could use
a good honest fuck...

46
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,054
Out of the way, you ugly freak.

47
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,130
What the hell?

48
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,572
Christ...

49
00:08:08,078 --> 00:08:09,670
Get the bitch!

50
00:09:34,598 --> 00:09:35,758
<i>What's wrong?</i>

51
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,065
<i>There's something you don't know...</i>

52
00:09:43,173 --> 00:09:45,607
<i>Love, nostalgia...</i>

53
00:09:46,243 --> 00:09:51,078
<i>A man in his mid 30s was shot today</i>
<i>on the outskirts of Str��ngn��s.</i>

54
00:09:51,515 --> 00:09:57,215
<i>He sustained injuries in the legs</i>,
<i>but is not in critical condition.</i>

55
00:09:57,521 --> 00:09:59,455
<i>The police decline to go into</i>
<i>details</i>

56
00:09:59,623 --> 00:10:02,922
<i>but say there is a connection</i>

57
00:10:03,093 --> 00:10:08,087
<i>to the three murders</i>
<i>that took place a week ago.</i>

58
00:10:19,877 --> 00:10:21,936
<i>This is a special traffic bulletin.</i>

59
00:10:22,112 --> 00:10:27,778
<i>Emergency vehicles are on their way</i>
<i>from S��dert��lje to Svavelsj��.</i>

60
00:10:28,786 --> 00:10:31,619
<i>Please use caution...</i>

61
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:43,596
He's willing to see you.

62
00:10:44,001 --> 00:10:47,129
But if he doesn't like you,
he'll throw you out.

63
00:10:48,072 --> 00:10:52,338
No interviews and
nothing in the media, is that clear?

64
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:07,982
Who are you?
Claiming to be Lisbeth's frend?

65
00:11:08,659 --> 00:11:14,529
I'm Mikael Blomkvist. I know other
reporters have been pestering you,

66
00:11:14,765 --> 00:11:19,532
but I'm not here for an article.
I'm here for Lisbeth's sake.

67
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:26,773
I don't think Lisbeth Salander's
involved in these killings.

68
00:11:27,344 --> 00:11:30,973
I think a man named Za achenko
is behind it all.

69
00:11:37,054 --> 00:11:38,453
Sit down.

70
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,050
Zalachenko...

71
00:11:47,197 --> 00:11:50,655
Alexander Zalachenko.

72
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,059
Do you know who he is?

73
00:11:54,071 --> 00:11:55,868
He's Lisbeth's father.

74
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:22,931
Lisbeth's mother's name
was Agneta Sj��lander.

75
00:12:24,501 --> 00:12:26,025
She was only 17

76
00:12:26,603 --> 00:12:32,564
when she met Zalachenko.
When Lisbeth was born...

77
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:39,448
...Agneta changed her name
from Sj��lander to Salander.

78
00:12:39,783 --> 00:12:42,343
Zala - Salander...

79
00:12:47,624 --> 00:12:50,957
Zalachenko wasn't around much.

80
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:56,094
But every now and then he'd show up
at the apartment on Lundagatan.

81
00:12:57,067 --> 00:13:01,697
He'd get drunk.
He'd beat Agneta.

82
00:13:02,272 --> 00:13:06,436
Sexually assault her and leave.

83
00:13:08,145 --> 00:13:10,773
It happened dozens of times...

84
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:16,284
Social Services should have done
something, but nothing happened.

85
00:13:17,454 --> 00:13:21,823
Not until 1993.

86
00:13:24,128 --> 00:13:25,117
What happened then?

87
00:13:33,904 --> 00:13:37,772
Lisbeth...was 12 years old.

88
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:42,238
Zalachenko laughed
when Lisbeth found her mother

89
00:13:42,646 --> 00:13:45,979
unconscious on the kitchen floor.

90
00:13:46,683 --> 00:13:50,915
He went to his car,
but Lisbeth ran after him...

91
00:13:52,156 --> 00:13:54,852
She dumped a carton

92
00:13:55,425 --> 00:13:57,950
full of gasoline over him...

93
00:14:05,869 --> 00:14:08,337
The man burned like a torch.

94
00:14:12,109 --> 00:14:13,167
Oh my God...

95
00:14:14,545 --> 00:14:18,879
This time there were consequences.

96
00:14:20,117 --> 00:14:26,147
Lisbeth was sent to a psychiatric
institution for juveniles.

97
00:14:27,524 --> 00:14:35,454
Her mother spent the last years
of her life in the hospital.

98
00:14:38,635 --> 00:14:40,728
She was never herself after that.

99
00:14:40,871 --> 00:14:46,400
She was allegedly
mentally disturbed...

100
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,081
Peter Teleborian.

101
00:14:53,317 --> 00:14:55,046
He was the one who committed her.

102
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:58,712
But her father, Alexander Zalachenko,
was never charged with anything.

103
00:14:59,423 --> 00:15:01,015
Jesus...

104
00:15:16,506 --> 00:15:17,734
Hi.

105
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:23,341
Does the name Zalachenko
mean anything to you?

106
00:15:23,447 --> 00:15:25,711
No. I'm late for a
press conference.

107
00:15:25,849 --> 00:15:29,114
He's Lisbeth Salander's father.

108
00:15:31,054 --> 00:15:34,046
She threw a fire
bomb at him in 1993,

109
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,384
and it was investigated
by the police.

110
00:15:36,793 --> 00:15:39,853
But not the regular police,
the Secret Police.

111
00:15:40,797 --> 00:15:43,425
Because Zalachenko worked for them.

112
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:48,399
They didn't want it made public.
He doesn't officially exist, you see.

113
00:15:48,705 --> 00:15:51,401
Where did you get this information?

114
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:56,069
I want you to find the files.
They've got to be in there somewhere.

115
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:03,777
I believe the files
will lead us to Zalachenko.

116
00:16:04,454 --> 00:16:08,914
And I'm convinced he was
involved in Dag and Mia's deaths.

117
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,925
Possibly even Bjurman's death.

118
00:16:13,063 --> 00:16:15,156
But it couldn't be
Lisbeth Salander, right?

119
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,565
Even though her
prints are on the gun.

120
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:23,231
- I know it seems strange.
- Real fucking strange.

121
00:16:23,407 --> 00:16:25,500
What's between you?

122
00:16:25,909 --> 00:16:29,675
- Why doesn't she come forward?
- Because Lisbeth is...

123
00:16:33,917 --> 00:16:36,112
She's a very private person.

124
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:41,815
I don't like these allegations
against the police.

125
00:16:42,192 --> 00:16:44,626
We have enough problems.

126
00:16:44,928 --> 00:16:47,954
We don't need the help of
some amateur private eye.

127
00:17:01,511 --> 00:17:02,808
Thank you...

128
00:17:08,051 --> 00:17:12,385
Paolo Roberto Braved Blaze
To Save Miriam

129
00:17:20,364 --> 00:17:23,993
<i>Do you still regard Lisbeth</i>
<i>as posing a public threat?</i>

130
00:17:24,201 --> 00:17:27,864
<i>She shot a man.</i>
<i>She's armed.</i>

131
00:17:28,138 --> 00:17:30,971
<i>So obviously</i>,
<i>we'd like to apprehend her.</i>

132
00:17:31,174 --> 00:17:34,007
<i>Do you know who</i>
<i>kidnapped Miriam Wu?</i>

133
00:17:34,144 --> 00:17:38,080
<i>I'll turn that question</i>
<i>over to Jan Bublanski.</i>

134
00:17:38,248 --> 00:17:42,082
<i>In connection with today's</i>
<i>shooting, we identified a man</i>

135
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:44,480
<i>who may have driven the van</i>

136
00:17:44,721 --> 00:17:47,417
<i>during the attempted kidnapping.</i>

137
00:17:48,725 --> 00:17:52,593
<i>- The man who was shot?</i>
- <i>I decline to comment on that.</i>

138
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:58,426
<i>However, we have no leads on the</i>
<i>person who assaulted Wu and</i>
<i>Roberto.</i>

139
00:17:58,668 --> 00:18:03,662
- <i>Do you have a description?</i>
- <i>A forensic sketch has been made.</i>

140
00:18:03,907 --> 00:18:06,603
<i>Based on witness accounts.</i>

141
00:18:06,943 --> 00:18:10,538
<i>A tall man with a muscular bulld.</i>

142
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:15,950
<i>Mid to late 30s. A body-builder.</i>

143
00:18:16,253 --> 00:18:18,016
<i>Short, pale blond hair.</i>

144
00:18:18,288 --> 00:18:21,223
<i>The media will have access</i>

145
00:18:21,425 --> 00:18:25,623
<i>to this image</i>
<i>after this conference...</i>

146
00:18:30,634 --> 00:18:33,432
<i>The police have</i>
<i>not yet apprehended</i>

147
00:18:33,603 --> 00:18:36,367
<i>the armed woman in her late 20s</i>,

148
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:40,134
<i>who was observed after the shooting</i>

149
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:45,071
<i>on the outskirts of Str��ngn��s,</i>
<i>leaving the scene on a motorcycle.</i>

150
00:18:45,449 --> 00:18:49,317
<i>Certain information may indicate</i>
<i>an underworld dispute...</i>

151
00:18:50,487 --> 00:18:53,081
They haven't understood a damn thing.

152
00:18:55,325 --> 00:18:58,453
Bublanski won't listen,
they're chasing the wrong lead.

153
00:18:59,729 --> 00:19:03,665
If the police arrest Lisbeth,
all hell could break loose.

154
00:19:04,301 --> 00:19:05,768
- Where are you going?
- Home.

155
00:19:06,803 --> 00:19:09,271
- Want me to come along?
- No, I m not good company.

156
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:13,235
You don't have to be good company...

157
00:19:25,322 --> 00:19:29,258
<i>Peter Teleborian, you are highly</i>
<i>critical and say it's a scandal</i>

158
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:32,860
<i>that she didn't receive</i>
<i>the treatment she needed.</i>

159
00:19:33,763 --> 00:19:37,164
<i>I prefer not</i>
<i>to discuss individual patients</i>,

160
00:19:37,701 --> 00:19:42,331
<i>but I do believe</i>
<i>that certain complex cases</i>

161
00:19:42,606 --> 00:19:45,837
<i>require a certain type of care.</i>

162
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:50,011
<i>And it's unfortunate</i>
<i>that three lives were lost</i>

163
00:19:50,614 --> 00:19:55,051
<i>as a result of cutbacks</i>
<i>in the psychiatric care sector.</i>

164
00:19:55,318 --> 00:19:58,116
<i>So this woman should have</i>
<i>remained incarcerated?</i>

165
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:02,823
<i>Certain patients</i>

166
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:07,828
<i>are better off in institutions,</i>
<i>than on their own in society, yes.</i>

167
00:20:40,497 --> 00:20:45,332
<i>Lisbeth, I know who Zalachenko is.</i>
<i>Palmgren told me.</i>

168
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:49,437
<i>I know what Teleborian did and why</i>
<i>you were locked up at that clinic.</i>

169
00:20:51,441 --> 00:20:55,844
<i>I know who killed Dag and Mia</i>,
<i>but not where Bjurman fits in.</i>

170
00:20:56,613 --> 00:20:59,946
<i>Please contact me.</i>
<i>We can solve this.</i>

Thank you for being my friend

174
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,611
It's me...

175
00:22:19,195 --> 00:22:21,095
Is this the guy?

176
00:22:23,366 --> 00:22:27,769
He was awful...
A fucking monster.

177
00:22:35,845 --> 00:22:39,440
Chrst...I'm so sorry.

178
00:22:41,785 --> 00:22:45,619
They were looking for you.
You do realize that, don't you?

179
00:22:47,691 --> 00:22:49,215
What have you done?

180
00:22:52,128 --> 00:22:57,122
Paolo said Blomkvist contacted him,
trying to get hold of you.

181
00:22:58,702 --> 00:23:01,830
- What's going on between you?
- I've got to go.

182
00:23:02,472 --> 00:23:06,465
- Where are you going?
- I have some unfinished business.

183
00:23:06,643 --> 00:23:07,667
Damn it, Lisbeth.

184
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:20,379
Someone was in here.

185
00:23:22,492 --> 00:23:25,928
Short, with fair hair...

186
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,494
I'll be back with something
to help you sleep.

187
00:24:03,266 --> 00:24:05,962
I should have done
it a long time ago.

188
00:24:33,663 --> 00:24:35,631
Inside. Go on!

189
00:24:37,567 --> 00:24:41,401
- Show me your rental records.
- They're on the computer.

190
00:24:42,172 --> 00:24:43,139
Turn it on.

191
00:24:48,344 --> 00:24:50,778
Come on...Nice and easy.

192
00:24:57,987 --> 00:24:58,954
Open that locker.

193
00:25:01,658 --> 00:25:02,750
Give me your phone.

194
00:25:05,195 --> 00:25:09,154
Get in.
Do it, so I won't have to hurt you.

195
00:25:12,502 --> 00:25:14,993
License plate number

196
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:21,672
- Where are your rental contracts?
- A red binder, above my desk.

197
00:25:33,723 --> 00:25:36,624
I need to rent a car.
Here's ten grand.

198
00:25:38,127 --> 00:25:39,492
And you'll get the car back.

199
00:26:09,425 --> 00:26:11,655
Thank you for being my friend

200
00:26:25,508 --> 00:26:27,908
- Hello?
- Hi, it's Miriam.

201
00:26:29,178 --> 00:26:32,238
Miriam Wu...
Could you come to the hospital?

202
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,219
- She was here? When?
- A few hours ago.

203
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,382
Did she say
where she was going?

204
00:26:46,596 --> 00:26:49,895
- No, she wouldn't.
- If she finds that monster...

205
00:26:50,199 --> 00:26:53,191
She won't be able to take him.
He'll kill her.

206
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:00,137
- Here. She forgot these.
- Forgot?

207
00:27:01,277 --> 00:27:03,802
Well, they fell out of her backpack.

208
00:27:06,616 --> 00:27:08,413
I have no idea where she lives.

209
00:27:08,751 --> 00:27:09,445
Do you?

210
00:27:14,223 --> 00:27:18,717
- What is it?
- This looks like a PO box key.

211
00:27:38,247 --> 00:27:40,772
- Will this do?
- Yes. Thanks.

Hello?

214
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,053
Lisbeth?

215
00:30:37,527 --> 00:30:40,758
<i>This is Radio G��teborg</i>
<i>with a traffic update.</i>

216
00:30:40,997 --> 00:30:43,488
<i>Route 190</i>

217

<i>is now open again</i>
<i>after the accident earlier today...</i>

218
00:32:12,355 --> 00:32:14,516
This was taken 17 years ago.

219
00:32:14,857 --> 00:32:17,018
This guy, Ronald Niederman,

220
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:21,557
was 18 at the time,
so he'd be 35 now.

221
00:32:22,198 --> 00:32:24,928
- Where'd you get this?
- Dynamic, in Hamburg.

222
00:32:25,868 --> 00:32:28,803
I told Micke
that the guy was a lousy boxer,

223
00:32:29,272 --> 00:32:34,938
but that he circled like one.
So he must have had training.

224
00:32:35,478 --> 00:32:38,641
I e-mailed a bunch
of European boxing clubs.

225
00:32:38,981 --> 00:32:42,974
Told them what had happened
and described the guy.

226
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,620
Turns out, he has a rare disorder,
"congenital analgesia".

227
00:32:49,458 --> 00:32:52,950
- What's that?
- It's a genetic disorder.

228
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:57,126
Nerve impulses aren't transmitted
properly, you don't experience pain.

<i>Hi, it's Malin. Roberto's</i>
<i>identified our blond giant.</i>

- It's complicated...

231
00:33:47,516 --> 00:33:48,983
You sound distracted...

232
00:33:50,152 --> 00:33:55,112
Paolo found his name,
it's Niederman.

233
00:33:55,524 --> 00:33:59,221
- Great. Do you have an address?
- No...

234
00:33:59,395 --> 00:34:01,886
All we have is
a 17-year-old German photo.

235
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,961
Hello? Micke?

236
00:34:07,069 --> 00:34:09,731
See if you can find any record
of him and call me.

237
00:34:57,019 --> 00:34:58,350
<i>If you're good to me...</i>

<i>I'll be good to you.</i>

239

a company called KAB Import

Any address?

248
00:36:11,293 --> 00:36:13,124
Bodin lives in western Sweden,

and his address
is PO Box 612, Gosseberga.

Mikael...

254
00:36:44,627 --> 00:36:48,154
We can't withhold information
from the police,

255
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:51,527
not in a murder case.

256
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:52,964
We won't.

257
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:57,063
I want you to do something for me.

258
00:36:58,474 --> 00:37:02,877
Here are Bj��rck's files
from the 1993 investigation.

259
00:37:03,879 --> 00:37:08,248
It includes correspondence between
Bj��rck and Teleborian about Lisbeth.

260
00:37:08,651 --> 00:37:13,179
Make copies and send
the originals to Bublanski.

261
00:37:15,724 --> 00:37:18,090
I'm going to G��teborg,
to find her before the police do.

262
00:37:18,327 --> 00:37:19,658
I'm going to be there
for her all the way.

263
00:37:20,095 --> 00:37:21,687
I owe her that.

264
00:37:25,167 --> 00:37:27,601
Christ, please be careful...

265
00:37:29,238 --> 00:37:31,263
Oh, Micke...

266
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:07,279
Hello, Daddy...

267
00:41:22,004 --> 00:41:23,995
<i>Bublanski and Modig are here.</i>

268
00:41:24,473 --> 00:41:27,601
They have read the files.

269
00:41:28,644 --> 00:41:32,637
And they want
Gunnar Bj��rck's address...

270
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:36,751
- Should we give it to them?
- They can find it themselves.

271
00:41:36,919 --> 00:41:41,253
How hard can it be, for God's sake?
They're fucking cops.

272
00:41:42,624 --> 00:41:43,921
Let me speak to him.

273
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:51,024
Come down to the station
and make a formal statement.

274
00:41:51,633 --> 00:41:55,091
It's not convenient.
I'm not in Stockholm.

275
00:41:56,705 --> 00:42:00,835
I'm just an ignorant amateur
private eye, remember?

276
00:42:01,043 --> 00:42:04,638
Don't be a child. I don't think
Salander's guilty, either.

277
00:42:05,647 --> 00:42:07,012
Put Erika back on.

278
00:42:11,019 --> 00:42:12,452
<i>Give them Bj��rck's address.</i>

279
00:42:13,956 --> 00:42:16,948
<i>And I'm switching off my phone</i>,
<i>so they can't track me. Bye.</i>

280
00:42:23,365 --> 00:42:26,459
You managed to set off
every single alarm.

281
00:42:27,636 --> 00:42:29,035
You've got motion detectors?

282
00:42:39,548 --> 00:42:40,879
You look like shit.

283
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:47,648
But you've got my eyes.

284
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:52,820
Does it hurt?

285
00:42:57,399 --> 00:42:59,833
I've thought about
you over the years.

286
00:43:00,769 --> 00:43:04,432
Like every time
I see myself in the mirror.

287
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,431
You should have
left my mother alone.

288
00:43:07,709 --> 00:43:08,539
Your mother...

289
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:12,570
- Your mother was a whore.
- No, she wasn't.

290
00:43:12,915 --> 00:43:15,782
She worked at a grocery store
and tried hard to make ends meet.

291
00:43:16,285 --> 00:43:19,083
Believe whatever you like
about your mother.

292
00:43:19,855 --> 00:43:21,755
But she was a whore.

293
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:26,292
I hated you...

294
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,924
But I've forgiven you.

295
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:35,798
Bullshit. Bjurman
hired you to kill me.

296
00:43:35,971 --> 00:43:40,806
That's completely different...
that's business.

297
00:43:42,778 --> 00:43:45,645
You had a little movie he wanted...

298
00:43:47,616 --> 00:43:50,710
And I have a modest
business operation.

299
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:58,150
Did he really rape you?

300
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:05,664
Christ, the guy
must have had shitty taste...

301
00:44:08,971 --> 00:44:11,667
Sit down!

302
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:14,667
Or I'll shoot you like a dog.

303
00:44:20,182 --> 00:44:22,673
Where did you find that freak?

304
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:25,818
Do you mean you
haven't figured it out?

305
00:44:27,856 --> 00:44:32,088
They say you're a skilled researcher.

306
00:44:32,794 --> 00:44:34,091
But I guess that's not true.

307
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,297
He's your brother.

308
00:44:40,869 --> 00:44:45,533
- What?
- Actually, he's your half-brother.

309
00:44:46,341 --> 00:44:50,778
The result of a fling long ago,
in Germany.

310
00:45:14,803 --> 00:45:18,364
Did Niederman kill Bjurman, too?
Why?

311
00:45:19,708 --> 00:45:24,168
Bjurman was a fool, and he
had documents that belonged to me.

312
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:29,248
He was one of the few people
who knew about my past.

313
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:32,976
I couldn't trust him
to keep his mouth shut.

314
00:45:33,255 --> 00:45:36,918
Particularly when those journalists
were poking around.

315
00:45:37,325 --> 00:45:39,418
It was too much...

316
00:45:39,995 --> 00:45:42,930
You've been too sloppy.
The police will find you.

317
00:45:43,231 --> 00:45:45,199
Oh dear, I'm so scared...

318
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:51,104
I didn't shoot anybody.

319
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:55,836
I'm just a poor old cripple, right?

320
00:46:01,516 --> 00:46:02,574
Ready?

321
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:38,549
Maybe I should say something...

322
00:46:40,455 --> 00:46:42,980
But I don't think
I have anything to say to you.

323
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:49,390
- That goes for me, too.
- Let's get this over with.

324
00:46:49,564 --> 00:46:51,293
I've nailed you, that's enough.

325
00:46:51,933 --> 00:46:53,491
The cops will be here tonight.

326
00:46:55,403 --> 00:46:56,631
Bullshit.

327
00:46:58,573 --> 00:47:00,905
I expected some bluffing...

328
00:47:02,577 --> 00:47:05,671
But you came here to kill me,
and that's that.

329
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:08,973
- You haven't talked to anyone.
- Can I show you something?

330
00:47:18,693 --> 00:47:21,628
Everything you've said for the past
hour has been broadcast online.

331
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:25,691
Let me see.

332
00:47:34,709 --> 00:47:35,801
No...

333
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:39,204
Not possible with this.

334
00:47:59,401 --> 00:48:00,561
You idiot!

335
00:48:06,041 --> 00:48:07,167
What are you waiting for?

336
00:52:43,818 --> 00:52:46,582
Come here...

337
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:57,945
It's me...

338
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:02,313
I'm here.

339
00:56:10,491 --> 00:56:11,981
Lisbeth...

340
00:56:28,543 --> 00:56:29,373
Thank you.
