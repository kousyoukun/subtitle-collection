00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,090
Stieg Larsson's
The Girl Who Played With Fire

2
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,480
Hello. Welcome.

3
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,640
Come here.
Yes, like that. Much better.

4
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:14,319
Will you be good to me?

5
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,209
Will you be good to me?
Then I'll be good to you.

6
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,530
It's too late.

7
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,789


8
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,639


9
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,449


10
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:57,009


11
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:58,969


12
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,729


13
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:11,439


14
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,319


15
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,610


16
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,560


17
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:57,650
Solicitor Bjurman?

18
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:00,860
Yes?

19
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,110
This is regarding a police file
dated 1993. Lisbeth Salander.

20
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:09,039
My employer would like to take a look at it.

21
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,550
Really?
And who is your employer?

22
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,550
I have the case files stored at my retreat.

23
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,269
- Do you have copies?
- No.

24
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,370
- Is she still abroad?
- Yes, most likely.

25
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:13,689
Thank you.

26
00:05:15,829 --> 00:05:17,300
Bjurman?

27
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,939
I will stay in touch.

28
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:18,470
You're supposed file reports about me to
the Guardianship.

29
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,439
- I do.
- Each month. You're sloppy.

30
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:24,769
- I have some reports stored at my retreat.
- Shut your mouth.

31
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,459
If your reports say I'm
behaving well,

32
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:30,420
I will let you go when I'm no
longer under the Guardianship.

33
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:34,290
If you can't do it, I'll send
our movie to every newspaper in the country.

34
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:38,329
If something happens to me,
or if I die, it will be made public.

35
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,980
And if you touch me again,
I'll kill you.

36
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,389
And one more thing:

37
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:48,350
If you visit that clinic in Marseilles
for tattoo removal,

38
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,709
I'll redo my work.
On your forehead.

39
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:54,980
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

40
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:11,759
Is this Zala?

41
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:14,449
Nils Bjurman.

42
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:19,209
You're interested the police file on
Lisbeth Salander.

43
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,209
I have it
in a safe place.

44
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,139
I'll let you have it, but only if you
take care of Salander first,

45
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:31,259
She has a DVD
which belongs to me,

46
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,480
When I have it,
you'll get the file,

47
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,500
She's back in Sweden,
and probably not difficult to find,

48
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,470
- Do you still see her?
- Who?

49
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,929
- Lisbeth Salander.
- I haven't seen her in a year.

50
00:08:57,669 --> 00:08:59,840
- Why is that?
- I don't know.

51
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,120
One day we'll talk.
The next day she won't answer the phone.

52
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,840
We must go now. Dag Svensson
will show up at the editorial meeting today.

53
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,580
- Dag who?
- He writes about human trafficking.

54
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,200
The girls from Eastern Europe.

55
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,750
- What kind of guy is he?
- Freelance. Young and bold.

56
00:09:21,669 --> 00:09:24,230
- Fit.
- Fit?

57
00:09:24,789 --> 00:09:28,759
- For how long have you been working on it?
- About four years.

58
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,909
I found the subject through my girlfriend.
She's researching gender and is a criminologist.

59
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,320
She's pursuing a PhD.
in human trafficking.

60
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,460
So you work as a team?

61
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,620
No, Mia focuses on the girls.

62
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,029
I focus more on distributors
and the span of customers.

63
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:49,129
And what have you found?

64
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,500
I have found
several prominent customers.

65
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,220
Amongst them
someone from the Justice Department,

66
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,179
who participated in
shaping the new sex market legislation.

67
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,909
Three police men,

68
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:03,120
one from vice,
one from S�K.

69
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,350
Five solicitors
one judge and one prosecutor

70
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:08,590
The affected girls -

71
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:12,519
are so low on the social ladder
they're irrelevant to the justice system.

72
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,820
Crimes against young Eastern European
girls is not a priority.

73
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,659
A whore is a whore.
That...

74
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,840
...is a part of the system.

75
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,610
How far have you progressed?
- I've completed the research.

76
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,740
What's missing is checking the facts -

77
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:32,700
and confronting the customers I want
to expose.

78
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,710
Hang on.

79
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,379
The last time I didn't check my facts properly,
I spent three months behind bars.

80
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,639
Everybody will get their
chance to comment on the allegations.

81
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,149
There is no need for you to worry.
The documentation is water proof.

82
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,460
- That sounds reassuring.
- Yes.

83
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,360
Okay...
We don't pay any huge salary.

84
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,539
I suggest
a two month project position.

85
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,240
You can have a desk there.

86
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:16,580
- Does it sound good?
- Yes, excellent.

87
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,769
We're poking our heads out with this
case. We have to realize that.

88
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,470
That is supposedly the whole point of
of Millennium?

89
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:30,940
- That's why we're sitting here.
- Yes, welcome to Millennium.

90
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,740
Thanks.

91
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,549
Sandstr�m?

92
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,210
Sandstr�m?

93
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:16,440
- We have a job for you.
- I don't think...

94
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:19,210
Yes, we do, actually.

95
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:44,809
Hello, Armanskij.

96
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,720
May I come in?

97
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,090
More than a year.

98
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,980
What do you want?
Do you need a job?

99
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,460
Do you work some place else?

100
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:30,460
I have been traveling.
I just recently returned to Sweden.

101
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,090
- Where have you been?
- Here and there.

102
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:38,970
Australia, New Zealand.
The last few months in the Caribbean.

103
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:48,159
I don't know why
I didn't say goodbye.

104
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:51,769
Because you don't really
care about other people.

105
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,190
You treat people trying to be your
friends like shit.

106
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:59,730
It's that simple.

107
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,679
Blomkvist has been looking for you.

108
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,860
He's called at least once
a month to inquire about you.

109
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,500
He cares as well.
Just like Holger Palmgren.

110
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,559
It has been two years since he had a stroke,

111
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,220
and you haven't even visited him.

112
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,399
Is he alive?

113
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,000
You don't even know
if he's dead or alive.

114
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,940
You've been missing.

115
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:14,269
I've been traveling.
I had to run away for a while.

116
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,009
Have you been worried?

117
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,659
No. You can do anything.

118
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,690
That's how it is.

119
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:33,690
How are things with the new...

120
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,980
...guardian?

121
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,940
Bjurman.

122
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,960
He's okay.
It's okay.

123
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:47,470
And you're still forced to be
under the supervision of a guardian?

124
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,360
Don't worry about me.

125
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:53,720
I'll fix it.
It's no longer your job.

126
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,350
No, I'm too old.

127
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,580
I'm just a silly, old fool.

128
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,629
Yes, you are.

129
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:04,850
Truly silly,
if that's what you think.

130
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:17,039
- I thought you were dead or something.
- Or something.

131
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,629
We didn't meet that often
before you left.

132
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,190
- I was busy.
- It's good to have you back.

133
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:27,220
I only know one person
who dares knock on the door -

134
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,269
after one and a half years of silence
to ask if I want to fuck.

135
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,720
...then I broke up with her and
went to Paris. Mom and dad lives there.

136
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,279
I worked in a club
near Clichy.

137
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:41,879
A fantastic place.

138
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,269
But I had applied for law school,
and been accepted.

139
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:49,429
- Mom found the letter and told...
- Do you want my apartment?

140
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,919
- What?
- Do you want my apartment?

141
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,110
- Are you moving?
- I have already moved.

142
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,460
I can't afford buying anything.

143
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,980
The rent has been paid for a year.
Do you want it?

144
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,170
- There's just one thing.
- I assumed that much.

145
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,809
I'm still registered here.
My mail is sent here.

146
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,509
You'll take care of it.

147
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,349
I can do that.
Where do you live?

148
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,140
- Some place else.
- Can I visit?

149
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,859
No. Not now.

150
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:42,549
But you'll come over to fuck me
when you feel like it?

151
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,970
I'd like that,
but it's not a part of the contract.

152
00:17:47,589 --> 00:17:50,430
You're not wired properly.
Are you serious?

153
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,019
Yes.

154
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:58,680
Come here.

155
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:25,839
Damn, I have something for you.

156
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:41,319
There you are.
Happy birthday.

157
00:19:42,589 --> 00:19:45,680
- This isn't my birthday.
- It's from last year.

158
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,480
If you're going to keep smoking
that crap,

159
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,210
you might as well do it with elegance.

160
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:24,599
You are the only one
who gives me presents.

161
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,109
- How are you?
- I'm good. Excellent.

162
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,890
Or just OK. I'm trying to get a hold
of one of the customers.

163
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,680
A policeman from S�K.
Gunnar Bj�rck.

164
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:55,690
But he's nowhere to be found.
As if swallowed by the earth.

165
00:20:56,349 --> 00:20:58,029
It's hopeless.

166
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,180
- What do you have?
- A PO Box address.

167
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,759
A PO Box address?

168
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,279
Try the lottery trick.

169
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:15,619
- What?
- The lottery trick.

170
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:19,309
Write to the PO Box
and tell him he's won...

171
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,609
...a monster cell phone with GPS
and that he's one of 20 selected

172
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:28,220
to win 100.000 if he'll participate
in a market research study.

173
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,539
Is it legal?

174
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,630
It can't be illegal
to give away a phone?

175
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,319
Say you're from
Indigo Market Research.

176
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,809
Hi, honey.
Sorry I'm late.

177
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,630
We're hitting the press next week,
so we're fucking busy.

178
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,190
Are you the only one
working in that paper?

179
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,240
Everybody's working like animals.
I need more time than the others.

180
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,039
Micke has begun confronting
some of the customers.

181
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,119
He's so experienced
they crap their pants if he just...

182
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,710
It's finished. Printed.
Yes.

183
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,039
It's already finished?
"From Russia With Love".

184
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:24,759
"Organized crime and
human trafficking".

185
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:27,660
- By Mia Bergman.
- That's me.

186
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,599
My girlfriend.

187
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:34,519
- We have to celebrate.
- Yes.

188
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,579
Give me a kiss.

189
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,950
- Give me a kiss.
- It's finished.

190
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:56,170
Lovely food.
Truly lovely, Annika.

191
00:22:56,839 --> 00:23:00,529
Why do you tell her?
I did the cooking.

192
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,380
It's quite tasty, Annika.

193
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:08,660
- Why don't you get married?
- Leave him be, aunt Angelina.

194
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:11,799
- He doesn't want to.
- Why not?

195
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:14,529
He's so handsome.

196
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,200
Mikael, do you have a woman?
You must have a woman.

197
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:20,660
Yes, I have a woman.

198
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:25,190
- So marry her.
- I'd love to, but she's already married.

199
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:31,150
Hi, am I interrupting?

200
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:34,900
No, I'm at my sister's and
half a platoon of her husbands family.

201
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:38,440
Sounds nice.
About the pictures...

202
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:43,009
They are on paper, and Mia
and I leave for Dalarna tomorrow.

203
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:46,180
I don't know if I should send
them with a messenger,

204
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,829
No, don't use a messenger.
I'm leaving soon.

205
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:53,559
I can give you a lift.

206
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:55,970
- I'll stop by.
- Great,

207
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,809
and one more thing.

208
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,450
I want to run a name.
A criminal named Zala.

209
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,359
Tell him he's Anton
in my dissertation.

210
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,089
- Did you hear that?
- Don't give me new material this late.

211
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,339
No, I know,
but I think it can pay off.

212
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:19,599
- We'll talk about it later.
- Yes,

213
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,230
Two minutes.

214
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,980
- Did something happen?
- It sounded like a gunshot.

215
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:56,210
Just now.

216
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,609
Dag?

217
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,970
Hello? Hello?

218
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,089
But you reported it?

219
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:38,859
Yes.

220
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:44,329
- Did you see what happened?
- No. I found them.

221
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:50,630
It can't have been
more than ten minutes after...

222
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:54,369
Do you have a description?
Did you see anyone run away from the scene?

223
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,359
No.

224
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Maybe the neighbors saw something.

225
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:04,180
Do you live here?

226
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:10,250
No, I was going to visit
the couple living here.

227
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,599
I'll be back.

228
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,990
Hello? Blomkvist?
We have a couple of questions.

229
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,750
You can't have that here!

230
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,059
The murdered couple
was a journalist and a criminologist.

231
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:18,269
They were found by another journalist.
Blomkvist from Millennium.

232
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,420
- What do we know about the motive?
- Not much at this point.

233
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,450
The girl was about to get her PhD.
in a couple of weeks.

234
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,329
This case has the highest priority.
Assemble a task force.

235
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,740
- Hans Faste, Jerker Holmberg.
- Sonja Modig.

236
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:39,759
You can pick out the team yourself.
But make it quick.

237
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,200
Ekstr�m, prosecutors.

238
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,019
You described the murders
as pure executions.

239
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,230
Which ones on the list are capable of that?
And getting away with it?

240
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,220
We're about to publish the names of
several persons

241
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,200
who'd prefer to stay out of the spotlight.

242
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,279
Some of them
had already been contacted by Dag.

243
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:11,160
- This is speculation.
- Shouldn't we hand the list over to the police?

244
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,660
- Yes, I suppose we should.
- No.

245
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:23,569
They can have the names of some customers,
but we must never reveal our sources.

246
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:29,400
It's about the safety of those
girls Mia interviewed.

247
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,380
It can be life or death.

248
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,069
Back to the first question:
Are we printing this?

249
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:43,740
- I think that's what Dag would've wanted.
- Agreed.

250
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:47,660
Christer?

251
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:52,730
Sure.

252
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,099
We have received a temporary report
about the murder weapon.

253
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:48,700
- It's illegal?
- No, it's perfectly legal.

254
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,019
It belongs to
solicitor Nils Erik Bjurman.

255
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,319
Acquired in 1983.
He's got an address on Gardet.

256
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,349
There you go.

257
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:01,779
We could also identify
two sets of fingerprints.

258
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,750
A woman born in 1981.

259
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:10,910
Arrested for assault in Gamla Stan
in 1998, when the fingerprints were taken.

260
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,549
- Do you have a name?
- Her name is Lisbeth... Salander.

261
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,920
Lisbeth Salander
seems quite disturbed.

262
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,180
She's under a legal guardian.

263
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:28,079
Guess who the guardian is?

264
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:32,180
Solicitor Nils Bjurman.
The owner of the murder weapon in Enskede.

265
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,200
She was already violent in school.

266
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,160
Psychiatric treatment as a teen.
We think she supports herself through prostitution.

267
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:42,609
And documented
violent tendencies.

268
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,920
- Do we have Salander's address?
- Lundagatan in S�dermalm.

269
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:52,019
Stop! Police.
Cross the street.

270
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:56,710
- Have you arrested Salander?
- No, we're waiting for backup.

271
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,269
- Call me.
- I'll call when we're done.

272
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,839
Hookers have no class anymore.

273
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,599
They look more fucked up every day.
Would you pick her up?

274
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,730
There has to be a simpler way.

275
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:20,039
Why call in the storm troopers
to catch one small fish?

276
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:23,460
The girl is 150 cm tall
and weighs 40 kg.

277
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:28,779
We're in
but the apartment is empty.

278
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:30,869
Affirmative.

279
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,430
- Faste?
- Yes?

280
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,450
Why did it say Salander Wu
on the door?

281
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,460
Have no idea.

282
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:09,069
Hello, this is Bjurman. Please leave
a message and I'll get back to you.

283
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,299
Hello?

284
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,329
Hello?

285
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,210
Snap one from that angle as well,
so we get it properly.

286
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:52,490
She's in there..

287
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:03,269
Thanks. My coffee craving was
about to kill me.

288
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:05,490
What have you found?

289
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:10,029
Bjurman, and an empty Magnum bullet box.
We're checking it for prints.

290
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,400
And copies of monthly reports on
Salander,

291
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,519
which he's been sending
to the Guardianship.

292
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:21,579
According to the reports
Salander is basically an angel.

293
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,849
We have turned him around.
There is something you should see.

294
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:36,329
"I am a sadistic pig and a rapist."

295
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:42,339
- What do you think?
- Not a bad motive for murder.

296
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,650
LISBETH 28
SOUGHT FOR THREE MURDERS

297
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:07,519
SOUGHT FOR THREE MURDERS
IN ENSKEDE

298
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,679
HUNTED FOR THREE MURDERS

299
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:17,360
JOURNALIST BLOMKVIST
FOUND THE MURDER VICTIMS

300
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,900
This afternoon another
victim was found.

301
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:45,970
The 56 year old socially committed
solicitor was found shot in his apartment.

302
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,750
Police is investigating
if the murders are connected.

303
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:55,400
One of the victims worked for
the newspaper Millennium,

304
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:59,170
where Blomkvist
is editor in charge.

305
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,800
According to Blomkvist,
Svensson was about to write about

306
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:07,400
IT security and hackers.

307
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,900
It's a great loss
for his family and colleagues

308
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:15,199
and the whole journalist community.

309
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,090
A brutal attack
on free society.

310
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:23,300
- Why did you tell them that?
- Because it's true.

311
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:27,429
One of Dag's specialties was hacking.

312
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,050
We had agreed that it would
be his next case.

313
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:35,570
And I want to find a certain person
before the police does.

314
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,460
Lisbeth reads everything I write.
No matter where she is.

315
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:44,039
And she's quite interested in the subject.

316
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:48,260
This statement might make her contact me.

317
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,800
- You have no doubts?
- About what?

318
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,599
No.

319
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,130
- No?
- Lisbeth has not murdered anyone.

320
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:12,190
- That's Dag's phone.
- I'll get it.

321
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:23,780
- Indigo Market Research.
- Good morning, my name is Gunnar Bj�rck.

322
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:27,969
I have received an
interesting offer from you.

323
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,070


324
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:43,070


325
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,170
THIS IS WHERE POLICE FOUND IRINA

326
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:22,460
DAG SVENSSON'S RESEARCH COPY

327
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,869
- Which documents were she looking for?
- The e-mail log from Svensson.

328
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,739
Or his research.

329
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:41,349
- Can you track her?
- No. She doesn't work like that.

330
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,460
She's got a reason to stay hidden.

331
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,199
- Do you think she's guilty as well?
- I'm not saying anything.

332
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:54,710
I know she hasn't done anything.
Not this time.

333
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,519
Why do you ask, mom?

334
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:04,360
The fucking police did it.
The pigs!

335
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:07,510
This place looks fucking awful.

336
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:11,340
I don't know.
She has vanished.

337
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,280
Wait, somebody is at the door.

338
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,389
Hi, Miriam.
Tony Scala, journalist.

339
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,409
Your girlfriend
is suspected of three murders.

340
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,260
Can you confirm that you
spent time abroad with Salander?

341
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,940
You have to talk to the media
sooner or later. I can help you.

342
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,949
Go to hell, you fucking pig!

343
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:44,090
A double espresso.

344
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,260
Why do you think Lisbeth is innocent?

345
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,960
She had no reason to kill Dag or Mia.
Especially not Mia.

346
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:58,039
Mia wanted to expose human trafficking.
Sounds like something Lisbeth could've done.

347
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:01,170
Lisbeth detests men
who hate women.

348
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:04,550
We have proof she was at
the scene of the crime.

349
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:09,090
- So you found fingerprints?
- Yes, she's connected to the murder weapon.

350
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,820
That doesn't mean she
pulled the trigger.

351
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,340
- And Bjurman? Her guardian?
- The answer lies in Svensson's research.

352
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:22,150
This is a police matter. We do not need
private detectives and their wild theories.

353
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:27,380
I have no theories. I'm stating
that Lisbeth did not kill Dag and Mia.

354
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:31,489
I want to present evidence.
I want to point out an alternative killer

355
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:36,510
and write an article you and your
peers won't like ...at all.

356
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:03,730
- This is Bj�rck.
- Hi, this is Indigo.

357
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:08,469
- Good, did you receive the travel instructions?
- Yes, that's not a problem.

358
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:12,139
This lottery and the cell phone ...

359
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,530
You're still one of the 20 selected.

360
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,170
- Have we met before?
- No.

361
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:25,349
You seem familiar.

362
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,570
Maybe you've seen me in the paper.

363
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,460
- What was your name again?
- Mikael Blomkvist. Journalist.

364
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:37,469
I work for Millennium.

365
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,949
I didn't know
you do market research.

366
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,570
Sure, sometimes.

367
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:49,840
Look at these three pictures
and tell me...

368
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:53,650
...which model you prefer.

369
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,300
First off, this is Lidia Kamarova.

370
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,059
She is 16 years old
and from Minsk in Belarus.

371
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,440
Then we have Myang So Hun.

372
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:11,369
She is 25 years old, a little older,
but it doesn't show.

373
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:14,880
She's also called Jo-Jo.
She's from Thailand.

374
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,889
And then we have Silvia,
her real name is Jelena Barasova.

375
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,389
She's 19 years old and from Tallinn.

376
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,869
You have paid for sex
from all these women.

377
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,780
So what I want to know is
which one is your favorite.

378
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,070
- Is this a joke?
- No.

379
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:44,849
Our journalist Dag Svensson had
documentation proving

380
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:47,739
that you paid them for sex.

381
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:50,440
- Did he contact you?
- Who?

382
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,579
- Dag Svensson.
- I've never heard that name.

383
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,929
- Now I want you to leave.
- Yes, that might be so.

384
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,570
He did not manage to confront you
with the documentation

385
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,469
before someone shot him.

386
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,840
Do you know solicitor Bjurman,
who was also shot and killed?

387
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,230
What do you want?

388
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:15,780
I want to allow the sex buyers to
comment on the facts

389
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:19,789
in our next theme issue on
human trafficking.

390
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:31,000
You do understand that you will
ruin my life if you print this?

391
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,539
Yes.

392
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,460
Several visits with Irina
Check Anton = Zala

393
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,659
Come on. Get up.

394
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,900
Get up.

395
00:43:52,119 --> 00:43:56,019
I'm going to ask you some questions,
Per Ake. If you answer, I'll let you live.

396
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,760
If you refuse, I'll zap you again.
100.000 volts.

397
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:05,000
If you lie or answer confusingly,
I'll zap you.

398
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:09,260
Your muscles will stop working,
and you'll hang yourself.

399
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,619
And I'm leaving.
Understand?

400
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,210
I don't want to die.

401
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:22,940
My mistake. I forgot to tell you that
you can't speak without my permission.

402
00:44:34,119 --> 00:44:37,280
- Is this your daughter?
- Yes. She'll be here any minute...

403
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,920
You're breaking the rules again.

404
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,320
- Do you want to die?
- No.

405
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,719
In January you visited Irina
in an apartment in Norsborg. Why?

406
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:03,690
I don't know...
I wanted her. She was beautiful.

407
00:45:05,559 --> 00:45:07,239
- Beautiful?
- Yes, she was beautiful.

408
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:10,909
And that gave you the right
to tie her up and fuck her?

409
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:23,480
You are a sadistic pig and a rapist.

410
00:45:25,239 --> 00:45:26,750
Isn't that so?

411
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,070
Who is Zala?

412
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,519
- I don't know.
- Don't abuse your chance.

413
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:50,840
I don't know who he is.
The journalist you shot asked about him as well.

414
00:45:51,559 --> 00:45:54,019
If I knew I would tell you.

415
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:57,050
I only spoke to someone who said
his name was Zala.

416
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:00,340
- One minute on the phone.
- Why?

417
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:04,079
I was supposed to import a car
with amphetamine from Tallinn.

418
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:06,260
I didn't want to.

419
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:11,139
They showed up a few days later
and told me I couldn't pull out.

420
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:14,349
Then they forced me
to come with them to...

421
00:46:16,199 --> 00:46:19,010
- To?
- Some storage facility.

422
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:23,670
The first thing I saw was a man
on the floor, beaten to a pulp.

423
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:27,690
- And he was there...
- Who? Zala?

424
00:46:28,199 --> 00:46:32,059
No, a blond fucker.
Pure muscle.

425
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,570
I've only seen him once before.
Damn.

426
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:38,690
- What's his name?
- I don't know.

427
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,849
What else happened?

428
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,199
They said the guy
on the floor was a snitch.

429
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,730
The blond raised him up
on a chair in front of me.

430
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:55,239
Then he put his hands
around his neck.

431
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:00,199
I heard his neck snapping.

432
00:47:02,599 --> 00:47:05,860
He died before my eyes.

433
00:47:10,199 --> 00:47:14,030
Then the blond wrapped his
hands around my neck.

434
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:20,460
Magge held a phone to my ear
and told me Zala wanted to speak to me.

435
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,849
What did he say?
Zala?

436
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:30,489
I was to do as I was told.
What choice did I have?

437
00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:34,519
Hello.

438
00:48:21,719 --> 00:48:25,090
We have to get back.
I have a lunch meeting.

439
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:41,659
Have you been in contact with her?

440
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,860
Who?

441
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:49,659
Who do you think?

442
00:48:51,639 --> 00:48:55,539
An old friend called this morning.

443
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:00,039
He's also convinced
Lisbeth Salander is innocent.

444
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:03,079
- Who?
- That's completely skewed.

445
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:06,610
Erika?

446
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:11,929
It's best if you meet and
discuss it yourselves.

447
00:49:15,239 --> 00:49:18,050
Jab, Paolo! Come on!
Give him a jab!

448
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:24,869
Move your feet, man.
Concentrate on your foot work. Come on!

449
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:27,280
Don't give up.

450
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,360
From where do you know Lisbeth?

451
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,010
We've boxed together since
she was 17.

452
00:49:34,519 --> 00:49:39,159
- Not in the same weight class.
- She's quite tough.

453
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:46,340
She's in trouble, yes?

454
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,860
She's in deep deep trouble.
Paolo, you have to help me.

455
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:07,039
I need to get in touch with
Lisbeth's girlfriend, Miriam Wu.

456
00:50:07,719 --> 00:50:10,909
- Have you read about her?
- I know her. Kick boxer.

457
00:50:11,559 --> 00:50:14,860
She refuses to talk to me because I'm
a journalist.

458
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:18,750
If you, as a known boxer,
talk to her...

459
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,449
And try to reach Lisbeth through her?

460
00:51:30,679 --> 00:51:33,099
Fuck...!
Come on!

461
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,449
Micke? You asked me to dig into
Gunnar Bj�rck's past.

462
00:52:19,159 --> 00:52:21,440
I ran into Nils Bjurman.

463
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:25,260
He was an officer in the security
department of the National Police Force.

464
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,969
- What? When was that?
- From '76 until '78.

465
00:52:31,719 --> 00:52:35,690
- Same time as Bj�rck.
- Fuck...!

466
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,900
- Where is she?
- Who?

467
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:22,239
- Lisbeth Salander.
- I told you, I don't know!

468
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,769
Wrong answer.

469
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:33,269
You have one more chance.
Then I'll start using this.

470
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:45,150
Run, Miriam!

471
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,219
- Hello?
- Micke, it's Paolo,

472
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,570
I'm at the hospital
with Miriam Wu.

473
00:59:03,159 --> 00:59:05,650
- What?
- Would be nice if you could come by.

474
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:29,219
I didn't shoot Dag and Mia.
If you want to help, find Zala, Lisbeth.

475
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:45,329
I can give and receive punches,

476
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:48,719
but he was no ordinary human.

477
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:53,179
- What did he look like?
- A blond, armor penetrating robot.

478
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,969
- He was pure muscle.
- And you never saw him before?

479
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:00,510
Never.
He moved exactly like a boxer.

480
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:04,530
He kept his guard up,
but at the same time seemed completely clueless.

481
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:08,679
- Clueless in what way? On drugs?
- No, it was very strange.

482
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:12,840
As if he had trained,
but never listened to his coach!

483
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:19,550
And then there was something
fucking scary.

484
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:24,449
I hit him rock hard.
About 100 punches went straight in.

485
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:28,730
But nothing happened.
As if he didn't feel anything.

486
01:00:31,039 --> 01:00:34,340
- Hello. Ward 1B?
- Further down the hall.

487
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,650
Jan Bublanski.

488
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,110
- How are you?
- Splendid.

489
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,519
I'll find a place where
we can talk uninterrupted.

490
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:54,179
- How is Miriam Wu?
- They're still examining her.

491
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:57,369
She looks like me.
It wasn't her they were after.

492
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,269
It was Lisbeth Salander.

493
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:05,440
We have identified 29 customers
and pimps from Dag's list.

494
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:10,039
In theory, they all had a motive
to murder Dag.

495
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:15,500
Eight names are missing.
We've given them pseudonyms.

496
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:19,340
- What are we doing about them?
- Malin is trying to identify them.

497
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:22,980
Some of the pseudonyms are
mentioned in Mia's dissertation.

498
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:27,599
We can find references there
which can lead to the names.

499
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:32,400
First I'd like to visit the
Dag wanted to expose.

500
01:01:33,159 --> 01:01:37,019
- They have the most to lose.
- Then we can do the following.

501
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:42,000
Sten Falstr�m, done.
He's done.

502
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:45,300
Karl Pettersson, done.
Per �ke Sandstr�m.

503
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:48,829
He's been confronted by Dag,
so we'll expose him.

504
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,070
And the guy from the security police force?
Bj�rck?

505
01:01:52,639 --> 01:01:56,289
What about the connection between him
and Bjurman? What about this Zala?

506
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,840
I'm not completely finished
with Bj�rck.

507
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,019
- It's Bj�rck.
- Blomkvist here. You never called.

508
01:02:18,639 --> 01:02:20,110
What do you want?

509
01:02:20,519 --> 01:02:23,929
You lied to me. You and Bjurman
worked together at S�PO in the 70s,

510
01:02:24,599 --> 01:02:28,360
Why would I tell you
who I worked with?

511
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:33,079
Tomorrow I'm holding a press conference
regarding the murders of Dag and Mia,

512
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:36,960
I will give details about
our article series on sex trade,

513
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:40,059
and you're the only customer
I'll expose.

514
01:02:40,599 --> 01:02:43,059
So you'll have the opportunity
to comment.

515
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:46,719
You want to destroy my life.
Why would I talk to you?

516
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:50,550
Since you know Bjurman,
you probably know Zala as well?

517
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,690
Hello?

518
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:59,500
You know who he is?

519
01:03:02,039 --> 01:03:04,780
What is that information
worth to you?

520
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:23,780
His real name is Zalachenko,
but he's called Zala.

521
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:31,730
What I'm about to tell you now is
top secret.

522
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:36,789
You understand it's important to me
that you guarantee source protection.

523
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:39,559
I've already done that.

524
01:03:40,039 --> 01:03:43,900
Zalachenko was born in 1940
in what was then the Soviet Union.

525
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:49,170
Both parents died during the war..
I assume you know what GRU was?

526
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,050
Yes, the military intelligence.

527
01:03:53,679 --> 01:03:57,440
He made his career in GRU.
Speaks six languages fluently.

528
01:03:58,159 --> 01:04:01,280
Expert in camouflage
and survival techniques.

529
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,750
Over the years he became
more and more corrupt.

530
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:09,039
GRU sent a military attach� -

531
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:13,550
from the embassy in Madrid
to find him -

532
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,309
and correct his ways.

533
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:21,829
Something went wrong
during that conversation.

534
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,480
Cut to the chase.

535
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:32,829
Zalachenko killed the
man from the embassy.

536
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:36,780
He realized he had burned all bridges,

537
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:40,440
went to Sweden, contacted the
security police and applied for asylum.

538
01:04:41,079 --> 01:04:43,889
- And?
- The actions of the government?

539
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:47,920
When a soviet top spy
applies for asylum?

540
01:04:48,599 --> 01:04:52,849
Never before had an operation's chief
for one of GRU's elite commands

541
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:56,489
deserted to Sweden.

542
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:58,809
- So he could stay?
- Yes.

543
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:02,469
- And started working for you?
- He was a gold mine.

544
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:06,880
We gave him a Swedish identity,
a passport and some money.

545
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:09,599
From then on he managed on his own.

546
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:13,489
In return we received good favors for
the information he provided us.

547
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:22,719
What about Bjurman?
Where does he enter the picture?

548
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:24,860
Bjurman...

549
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:28,260
We were young back then.
What were we? 25? 30?

550
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:33,090
Not really qualified to handle
someone like Zalachenko.

551
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:38,269
He came to us
on election day in '76.

552
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:41,760
Hardly a soul to be found
at the police station.

553
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:46,050
Everybody had time off
or were busy with the election.

554
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:50,760
I was the officer in charge, and considered
it a common immigration matter.

555
01:05:51,519 --> 01:05:54,500
I brought Bjurman as caseworker.

556
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:58,739
His further involvement
was completely random.

557
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:02,210
- Random?
- Yes, actually.

558
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,380
"Praktvindel." (Beach Moonflower)

559
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:07,880
- What?
- That's what it's called.

560
01:06:11,639 --> 01:06:14,340
- Where is Zalachenko today?
- I don't know.

561
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:18,469
I had his case until 1985.
I then received other tasks.

562
01:06:23,159 --> 01:06:26,420
You gave him a new identity
and a Swedish name. What is it?

563
01:06:27,079 --> 01:06:29,250
- That I won't tell you.
- Come on.

564
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,690
You wanted to know who Zala is.

565
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:34,619
I'm not saying more until I know
you're true to your word.

566
01:06:35,159 --> 01:06:38,639
I believe Zalachenko committed three murders,
and the police is hunting the wrong person.

567
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:43,010
- Why isn't Salander the murderer?
- I believe Zalachenko did it.

568
01:06:43,719 --> 01:06:45,469
You are mistaken.

569
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:49,500
Zala has not murdered anyone.
He's 69 and somewhat disabled.

570
01:06:50,199 --> 01:06:54,130
Walks around on crutches. He's not been
running around shooting people.

571
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:58,389
If he wants to commit murder,
he'll have to order welfare transport.

572
01:06:59,079 --> 01:07:01,849
I hope I won't have to see
my name in your paper now.

573
01:08:58,159 --> 01:09:00,119
What do you want for it?

574
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:03,859
Half. 200.000.
Cash.

575
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:09,460
Okay. I don't have the money here,
but we'll go pick them up.

576
01:09:10,159 --> 01:09:12,649
- When?
- At once.

577
01:09:13,199 --> 01:09:15,229
I'll go pick them up.

578
01:09:16,350 --> 01:09:19,899
- How did it go?
- With what?

579
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:22,970
What do you mean?

580
01:09:23,390 --> 01:09:26,579
Bjurman's retreat, you were
supposed to burn it to the ground.

581
01:09:29,119 --> 01:09:32,770
We... We were just about to.
We haven't had time yet.

582
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,100
No time?

583
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:40,310
We'll fix it right away.
We'll pick up the money afterwards.

584
01:09:41,039 --> 01:09:43,850
We'll be right back with the cash.
Okay?

585
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:54,399
I'll wait here.

586
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,739
What the fuck...?
It's that little bitch Salander.

587
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:48,890
We've been fucking looking for you.

588
01:11:49,390 --> 01:11:52,199
Not even your little girlfriend
knew where you were.

589
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:56,100
At least that's what she told us.
Right, Magge?

590
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:58,579
Fucking carpet muncher.

591
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,850
I think she could use some cock.

592
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:10,569
Try it.

593
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,210
Move, fucking retard.

594
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:24,149
What the fuck are you doing?

595
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:27,600
Oh shit...

596
01:12:31,079 --> 01:12:33,079
Knock her out, man!

597
01:13:55,159 --> 01:13:57,619
- There is something you don't know.
- What is that?

598
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:00,850
About Reine.

599
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,250
Love, nostalgia ...

600
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:09,529
A 35 year old male was shot today
in a cabin area.

601
01:14:10,319 --> 01:14:15,270
The man was taken to hospital.
His condition is not critical.

602
01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:20,229
Police said that shooting might
be linked to...

603
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:25,920
...murders in the suburbs Enskede
and G�rdet, Stockholm.

604
01:14:37,159 --> 01:14:40,109
We have a couple of traffic reports
from Radio Stockholm.

605
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:44,689
Emergency vehicles are on their way
from S�dert�je to Sv�velsj�.

606
01:14:45,430 --> 01:14:48,520
We're asking all motorist to pay
extra attention.

607
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:00,239
He has agreed to meet you.

608
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:03,909
But if he doesn't like you,
he'll throw you out on your ass.

609
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:08,109
And you can't interview him
or write anything in the media.

610
01:15:19,279 --> 01:15:23,319
Who are you calling yourself
Lisbeth's friend?

611
01:15:24,079 --> 01:15:26,180
My name is Mikael Blomkvist.

612
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:29,350
I know you've been bothered
by journalists,

613
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:32,550
but I'm not here for an interview.

614
01:15:33,119 --> 01:15:35,119
I'm here for Lisbeth.

615
01:15:38,319 --> 01:15:41,970
I don't think she's got anything to do
with those murders.

616
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:45,699
I believe a man named Zalachenko
is behind them.

617
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:53,569
Sit down.

618
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:59,149
Zalachenko.

619
01:16:01,159 --> 01:16:05,060
- Alexander Zalachenko.
- You know who he is?

620
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:10,010
He's Lisbeth's father.

621
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:32,649
Lisbeth's mother, her name was...

622
01:16:33,119 --> 01:16:35,079
...Agneta Sj�lander.

623
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:41,140
She was only 17 years old
when Zalachenko met her.

624
01:16:42,470 --> 01:16:45,279
When Lisbeth was born,

625
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:49,140
her mother changed her name

626
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:52,850
from Sj�lander to Salander.

627
01:16:53,470 --> 01:16:55,289
Zala... Salander.

628
01:16:59,119 --> 01:17:01,819
Zalachenko was seldom home.

629
01:17:02,390 --> 01:17:06,390
But he showed up in between
at the apartment in Lundagatan.

630
01:17:08,319 --> 01:17:12,149
He got drunk,
abused the mother.

631
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:17,020
Forced her to have sex.
Then he disappeared.

632
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:21,210
This happened dozens of times.

633
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:25,949
The municipality should have intervened,
but they did nothing.

634
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:31,350
Not until 1993.

635
01:17:34,199 --> 01:17:36,130
What happened then?

636
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:43,319
Attempted murder. She tried to kill
her father with a fire bomb.

637
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:46,720
Lisbeth was 12 years old.

638
01:17:48,199 --> 01:17:51,569
Zalachenko laughed
when Lisbeth found her mother...

639
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:54,560
...unconscious on the kitchen floor.

640
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:59,739
He went out and got in his car,
but Lisbeth ran after him...

641
01:18:00,470 --> 01:18:05,670
...and threw a milk carton
filled with gasoline into the car.

642
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:16,119
A man burns like a torch.

643
01:18:20,079 --> 01:18:21,869
My God.

644
01:18:22,319 --> 01:18:26,460
And this time
it had consequences.

645
01:18:27,239 --> 01:18:29,130
Lisbeth was taken...

646
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:33,180
...and ended up in a children's
psychiatric ward in Uppsala.

647
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:38,439
Her mother was admitted to hospital
during those few years she had left.

648
01:18:41,039 --> 01:18:43,140
She never recovered.

649
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:49,859
- About her having psychiatric problems...
- Peter Teleborian.

650
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:53,869
He got her admitted
to psychiatric care.

651
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:02,859
On the other hand, her father,
Alexander Zalachenko, received no punishment.

652
01:19:05,430 --> 01:19:06,970
God damn ...

653
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:23,989
Hello.

654
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:28,069
Alexander Zalachenko.
Does the name tell you anything?

655
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:33,220
- No. The press conference is about to start.
- He's Lisbeth Salander's father.

656
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:38,439
She assaulted him
with a fire bomb in 1993,

657
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:43,319
and the police investigated the matter.
Notice that it was the security police.

658
01:19:44,119 --> 01:19:47,310
- Why?
- Zalachenko worked for them.

659
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:50,939
He could not be identified.
Officially he doesn't exist.

660
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:54,890
- He's not listed in any public records.
- And how do you know this?

661
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:59,210
You will go find the old case file,
if it's in there some place.

662
01:20:03,470 --> 01:20:06,630
I think it can lead us to Zalachenko.

663
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:11,569
I'm convinced he's got something to do
with the murders in Enskede.

664
01:20:12,279 --> 01:20:15,439
Mostly likely the murder of
solicitor Bjurman as well.

665
01:20:16,079 --> 01:20:18,640
Contrary to Lisbeth Salander?

666
01:20:19,199 --> 01:20:23,310
- Her fingerprints are on the weapon.
- I know it sounds peculiar.

667
01:20:24,079 --> 01:20:27,560
Peculiar, indeed. Why are you
so interested in Lisbeth Salander?

668
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:30,449
If she's innocent,
why won't she turn herself in?

669
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,680
Lisbeth is...

670
01:20:36,079 --> 01:20:39,170
...a very private person.

671
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:44,149
I don't like that you're constantly trying
to create a lead.

672
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:48,720
We have enough problems. We'll solve
this case without private investigators.

673
01:21:03,159 --> 01:21:04,909
Welcome back.

674
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:13,670
Paolo Roberto saved
Miriam from the flames.

675
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:23,680
Do you still consider Lisbeth
a danger to her surroundings?

676
01:21:24,319 --> 01:21:27,369
She has shot a person.
She is armed.

677
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,560
Of course we'll capture her.

678
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:33,789
Do you know who was behind
Miriam's kidnapping?

679
01:21:34,350 --> 01:21:37,680
We'll pass on that question to
lead investigator Bublanski.

680
01:21:38,350 --> 01:21:41,760
A man involved in
this morning's shooting incident

681
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:46,890
was possibly the driver during a
previous kidnapping attempt.

682
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:51,130
- The man who was shot?
- No comment.

683
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:56,649
The one abusing
Miriam Wu and Paolo Roberto...

684
01:21:57,350 --> 01:21:59,310
...left no traces.

685
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:02,260
And you have no description of him?

686
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:05,920
We've had this drawing made.

687
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:09,890
It's based on witness descriptions.

688
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:15,340
It's a large, muscular male
around 35-40 years old.

689
01:22:16,199 --> 01:22:19,920
Built like a body builder.
Short, blond hair.

690
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:25,489
The drawing will be made available to everybody
after the press conference.

691
01:22:28,159 --> 01:22:33,319
Police informed that they have not
apprehended the 28 year old woman,

692
01:22:34,239 --> 01:22:38,599
which after the shooting incident
in the cabin area at Str�ngn�s

693
01:22:38,839 --> 01:22:41,449
fled the scene on a motorcycle.

694
01:22:42,119 --> 01:22:45,699
According to information available,
it may be gang related.

695
01:22:47,279 --> 01:22:49,560
They have no fucking clue!

696
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:55,079
Bublanski didn't listen.
They are locked in on one single lead.

697
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:59,380
If the police apprehends Lisbeth,
anything can happen.

698
01:23:00,079 --> 01:23:02,079
- Where are you going?
- Home.

699
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:05,539
- Should I come with?
- No, I wouldn't be pleasant company at the moment.

700
01:23:06,159 --> 01:23:08,859
You don't have to be.

701
01:23:20,350 --> 01:23:22,810
And you, Teleborian,
are even more critical.

702
01:23:23,350 --> 01:23:27,560
You're calling it a scandal
that she did not receive treatment.

703
01:23:28,350 --> 01:23:31,680
I won't comment on individual cases.

704
01:23:32,350 --> 01:23:37,060
But I have to say that
certain complex cases...

705
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:40,270
...require qualified treatment.

706
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:44,170
I can only say I'm sorry
that three people lost their lives

707
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:48,840
as a result of the budgetary cuts
in psychiatric care.

708
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:51,949
So this woman should be locked up?

709
01:23:55,119 --> 01:23:58,000
There are patients
who should be institutionalized

710
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:01,970
instead of moving around
freely in society.

711
01:24:33,159 --> 01:24:35,300
I know who Zalachenko is.

712
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:38,779
I have talked to Palmgren
and understand Teleborian's part,

713
01:24:39,390 --> 01:24:42,720
and why you had to be locked up
in the children's psychiatric ward.

714
01:24:43,390 --> 01:24:45,560
I believe I know
who killed Dag and Mia.

715
01:24:46,079 --> 01:24:50,720
But I don't understand Bjurman's part in this.
Turn yourself in, we can solve this.

716
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,250
Thank you for being my friend.

717
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:53,529
It's me.

718
01:25:54,470 --> 01:25:55,729
Okay.

719
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:09,600
Did he look like this?

720
01:26:11,159 --> 01:26:15,060
He was horrible.
A real monster.

721
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:26,300
Fuck.
Fuck, I'm sorry.

722
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:31,539
You're the one they were looking for.
But you know that?

723
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:36,329
What have you done?

724
01:26:39,390 --> 01:26:42,899
Paolo said Blomkvist contacted him
to get to you.

725
01:26:45,279 --> 01:26:47,810
- What is there between you two?
- I have to go.

726
01:26:48,350 --> 01:26:51,829
- Where are you going?
- There is something I have to finish.

727
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:53,920
What the fuck...?

728
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:06,880
There was a lady in here.

729
01:27:07,430 --> 01:27:10,619
A short blonde, she left.

730
01:27:11,279 --> 01:27:14,159
I'll bring you something to help you sleep.
I'll be right back.

731
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:50,340
I should've done it a long time ago.

732
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:18,430
Inside. Inside!

733
01:28:20,319 --> 01:28:22,529
I want to see your records
of rented cars.

734
01:28:23,039 --> 01:28:25,779
- They are on the computer.
- Turn it on.

735
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:32,619
Come. Slowly.

736
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:41,210
Open the closet.

737
01:28:43,119 --> 01:28:44,979
Give me your cell phone.

738
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:49,899
Go inside the closet.
And I won't have to hurt you.

739
01:28:57,479 --> 01:29:01,939
- Where do you keep your rental contracts?
- In a folder on the shelf.

740
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:17,050
I need to rent a car.
I'm leaving 10.000 here.

741
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:19,260
You will get your car back.

742
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:50,640
Thank you for being my friend.

743
01:30:04,039 --> 01:30:07,229
Hello, it's Miriam, Miriam Wu.

744
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:11,220
Can you stop by the hospital?

745
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:17,250
- So she's been here? When?
- A few hours ago.

746
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:20,239
Did she say where she was going?

747
01:30:23,319 --> 01:30:25,390
No, Lisbeth doesn't do that.

748
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:29,359
If she tracks down that monster,
he'll kill her.

749
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:35,829
Here. She forgot these.

750
01:30:36,319 --> 01:30:38,739
- Forgot?
- No, she dropped them.

751
01:30:39,279 --> 01:30:41,630
They fell out of her backpack.

752
01:30:43,039 --> 01:30:45,569
I have no idea where she lives.
Do you?

753
01:30:50,279 --> 01:30:54,180
- What is it?
- Looks like a PO Box key.

754
01:31:13,399 --> 01:31:16,029
- Can you use this?
- Yes please.

755
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:35,449


756
01:31:37,199 --> 01:31:40,569


757
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:44,319
Hello?

758
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:28,319
Lisbeth?

759
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:10,340
Gothenburg Traffic Radio. There's been
an accident on Grabov�gen, road F90.

760
01:34:11,199 --> 01:34:15,130
The accident has caused traffic jams,
and traffic is moving slowly.

761
01:34:21,159 --> 01:34:26,079
The social board in Biskopsgarden requests
support for measures against domestic violence.

762
01:34:29,319 --> 01:34:31,640
It's most certainly called an apple core.

763
01:34:32,159 --> 01:34:34,479
Back to pretensions.

764
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:39,810
In retrospect, what is the
most pretentious work you have written?

765
01:35:36,199 --> 01:35:40,449
This picture is 17 years old.
His name is Ronald Niederman.

766
01:35:41,239 --> 01:35:44,609
He was 18 when he was caught
so today he's 35.

767
01:35:45,279 --> 01:35:48,159
- Where did you get the picture?
- Dynamic in Hamburg.

768
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:52,550
Like I told Micke, he's not worth
jack shit as a boxer.

769
01:35:53,279 --> 01:35:57,250
But he moved like a boxer,
so somebody must've coached him.

770
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:01,119
I e-mailed several boxing gyms
in Europe.

771
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:05,310
Told them what had happened
and tried to describe him.

772
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:10,279
He has an illness.
He was born with analgesia.

773
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,020
- What is that?
- I looked it up. Genetic error.

774
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:18,760
The nerve synapses do not work.
You feel no pain.

775
01:36:55,039 --> 01:36:57,039
- Yes?
- Hi, this is Malin.

776
01:36:57,520 --> 01:37:00,149
Paolo has identified the blond.

777
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:02,439
Good.

778
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:06,210
- Where are you?
- It's a bit hard to say.

779
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:09,409
- You sound strange.
- What did you say?

780
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:12,729
Paolo knows who the
blond boxer is.

781
01:37:13,319 --> 01:37:16,479
- His name is Niederman.
- Great. Do you have the address?

782
01:37:18,119 --> 01:37:21,770
All we have is a 17 year old picture
from Hamburg, Germany.

783
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:25,810
Hello? Micke?

784
01:37:26,279 --> 01:37:29,369
Try to find him in the phone book.
I'm on my cell phone. Good bye.

785
01:38:14,159 --> 01:38:16,369
Will you be good to me?

786
01:38:22,359 --> 01:38:26,119
Will you be good to me?
Then I'll be good to you.

787
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:31,439
It's too late.

788
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:01,470
Hello, it's Malin.
I think I have something now.

789
01:39:02,079 --> 01:39:05,409
There is no Niederman
in Sweden's public records.

790
01:39:06,079 --> 01:39:09,699
But in '98 a shareholder company
was registered...

791
01:39:10,399 --> 01:39:12,609
...called KKAB Import.

792
01:39:13,119 --> 01:39:17,760
The chairman of the board is named
Karl Axel Bodin, born in 1944.

793
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:22,289
Third member of the board is
a man named R. Niederman.

794
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,960
- Do you have an address?
- Yes.

795
01:39:25,439 --> 01:39:28,350
Karl Axel Bodin
is registered in Western Sweden -

796
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:33,000
with address PO Box 612
in Gosseberga.

797
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,390
Neat...

798
01:39:48,079 --> 01:39:50,470
- Erika?
- Hi. Where have you been?

799
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,930
- Come!
- What is it?

800
01:39:58,079 --> 01:40:02,960
We can't keep information from the police
in the middle of a murder investigation.

801
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:08,050
That's not what we're doing.
I want to ask you for a favor.

802
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:14,369
This is Bj�rck's report from 1993.

803
01:40:15,079 --> 01:40:17,850
It contains parts of
Bj�rck's and Teleborian's...

804
01:40:18,439 --> 01:40:20,439
...correspondence about Lisbeth.

805
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:24,539
Can you make a copy of it and
send the originals to Bublanski?

806
01:40:25,239 --> 01:40:27,029
I'm leaving for Gothenburg.

807
01:40:27,479 --> 01:40:30,890
I want to find her before the police does,
and be there for her.

808
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:33,560
I owe her that.

809
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:40,699
Be careful!!
Mikael, really...

810
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,470
Hello, father.

811
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:25,510
- Yes?
- Bublanski and Modig is here.

812
01:44:26,079 --> 01:44:28,920
They just read the report
about Salander from '93.

813
01:44:31,119 --> 01:44:34,949
Now they want Bj�rck's address.
Can we give it to them?

814
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:37,850
They can find it themselves.

815
01:44:38,359 --> 01:44:41,659
How hard can it be?
They're the fucking police.

816
01:44:43,319 --> 01:44:45,279
Let me speak to him.

817
01:44:46,439 --> 01:44:50,510
Blomkvist, I think it's best that you come
in and give us your witness statement.

818
01:44:51,279 --> 01:44:54,189
I have no time for it.
I'm not in Stockholm.

819
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:56,270
Where are you?

820
01:44:56,680 --> 01:45:00,159
Remember that I'm a private snoop and
I don't understand jack shit.

821
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:04,350
Don't be childish.
I'm also doubting Salander's guilt.

822
01:45:05,680 --> 01:45:07,930
May I talk to Erika again?

823
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:12,380
- Yes?
- Give them Bj�rck's address.

824
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:16,289
I'm turning my cell phone off now.
I don't want to be traced. Good bye.

825
01:45:21,960 --> 01:45:24,380
You set off every alarm on the farm.

826
01:45:26,319 --> 01:45:28,250
Movement sensors?

827
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:39,510
You look like shit.

828
01:45:43,640 --> 01:45:45,390
But you have my eyes...

829
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:51,369
Are you in pain?

830
01:45:53,279 --> 01:45:54,329
No.

831
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:57,000
I have given you some
thought over the years.

832
01:45:58,119 --> 01:46:01,279
About every time I look in the mirror.

833
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:04,449
You should've left my mother alone.

834
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,739
Your mother...
Your mother was a whore.

835
01:46:08,319 --> 01:46:12,180
No. She was a cashier and tried her best
to make ends meet.

836
01:46:12,920 --> 01:46:15,659
You can think what you want
about your mother.

837
01:46:16,239 --> 01:46:18,029
But she was a whore.

838
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:22,600
I hated you.

839
01:46:27,279 --> 01:46:29,529
- But I have forgiven you.
- Bullshit!

840
01:46:30,039 --> 01:46:32,069
Bjurman hired you to kill me.

841
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:36,489
That was a whole different matter.
That was business.

842
01:46:38,359 --> 01:46:41,060
You had a movie he wanted.

843
01:46:43,079 --> 01:46:45,890
And I'm running a small business.

844
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:52,880
Did he really rape you?

845
01:46:56,600 --> 01:46:59,760
He must've had some
fucking bad taste in women.

846
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:04,899
Sit!

847
01:47:05,279 --> 01:47:08,720
Sit down,
or I'll shoot you like a dog.

848
01:47:14,680 --> 01:47:19,140
- Where did you find that retard?
- You really haven't figured it out yet?

849
01:47:21,279 --> 01:47:24,899
They claimed you're a
really good researcher.

850
01:47:26,359 --> 01:47:28,319
Obviously not.

851
01:47:31,279 --> 01:47:33,100
He's your brother.

852
01:47:34,399 --> 01:47:38,399
- What?
- Correction, you half brother.

853
01:47:39,159 --> 01:47:42,920
The result of a recreational incident
a long time ago in Germany.

854
01:48:06,479 --> 01:48:09,640
Did Niederman shoot Bjurman as well?
Why?

855
01:48:11,399 --> 01:48:15,859
Bjurman was a moron.
He had papers that were mine.

856
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:19,800
He was one of very few
who knew about my background.

857
01:48:20,439 --> 01:48:23,489
I could not trust that he
would keep his mouth shut.

858
01:48:24,119 --> 01:48:27,420
Especially not when journalists began
meddling in our affairs.

859
01:48:28,079 --> 01:48:30,180
That was the drop.

860
01:48:30,680 --> 01:48:33,699
You made too many mistakes.
The police will identify you.

861
01:48:34,319 --> 01:48:36,880
Oh, I'm scared.

862
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:41,880
No, I didn't shoot anyone.

863
01:48:42,399 --> 01:48:45,659
I'm just an old, wounded invalid.

864
01:48:51,399 --> 01:48:53,050
Ready?

865
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:26,949
I should probably say something.

866
01:49:28,720 --> 01:49:31,279
But I have nothing to say to you.

867
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:34,159
That's okay. Neither do I.

868
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:37,109
Let's get it over with.

869
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:42,159
Fortunately I managed to catch you red handed.
The police will come tonight.

870
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:44,539
Bullshit!

871
01:49:45,640 --> 01:49:48,029
I was waiting for you to make a bluff.

872
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:54,069
You came here to kill me.
You didn't talk to anyone.

873
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:56,840
May I show you something?

874
01:50:05,439 --> 01:50:08,810
Everything you said the last hour
has been published online.

875
01:50:11,239 --> 01:50:12,710
May I see?

876
01:50:21,439 --> 01:50:24,699
No, this isn't one of those.

877
01:50:44,520 --> 01:50:46,029
Idiot!

878
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:52,560
What are you waiting for?

879
01:55:17,439 --> 01:55:19,829
Come here! Come here!

880
01:58:22,239 --> 01:58:23,569
It's me.

881
01:58:26,359 --> 01:58:27,939
It's me.

882
01:58:35,399 --> 01:58:37,149
Lisbeth...

883
01:58:53,079 --> 01:58:54,970
Thank you.

884
02:02:10,720 --> 02:02:13,529
