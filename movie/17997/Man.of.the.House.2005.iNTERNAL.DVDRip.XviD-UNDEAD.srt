1
00:00:56,923 --> 00:01:00,086
Says your source got religion
while he was in the can.

2
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:02,423
- You trust him?
- No.

3
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,661
Sharp, we're going to a church.

4
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,068
That's why I didn't bring a helicopter.

5
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:14,732
Everybody, get your hands up.

6
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:17,671
Now keep them up...

7
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:19,808
and say, "Hey!"

8
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,377
Say, "Oh!"

9
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,783
All right. Then go ahead.

10
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,384
We have learned from the three wise men...

11
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:33,725
The O'Jays...

12
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:38,256
Eddie, Walter, and the other guy...

13
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,500
that there is a train coming...

14
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,093
and it is a train of love.

15
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:48,903
Michael rowed his boat ashore.

16
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:57,648
Because he, too, wanted to get
off that water and get on the train.

17
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,374
<i>Had the ticket.</i>

18
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:17,735
And I, too, want to be on that same train.

19
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:21,532
So I will see everyone next week. Hopefully.

20
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,184
Percy Stevens. What's it been?

21
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:35,049
Three to five years with time off
for good behavior?

22
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,521
Sharp, how are you?

23
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:41,387
This is a church, all right?

24
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,691
A place that's sacred.
And it shall remain untainted.

25
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:47,960
We're looking for an old cellmate of yours,
Morgan Ball. You seen him?

26
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:49,932
He's a key witness in one of my cases.

27
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:53,563
Come on, man.
I don't hang with that crowd anymore.

28
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:57,710
I am a prophet in a nonprofit world.

29
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:24,566
Aren't you worried about him getting away?

30
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:31,270
I'm more worried
about him having a heart attack.

31
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:58,603
You want me to call an ambulance for you?

32
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,440
Look, man, I don't even know
why I'm running in the first place.

33
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:05,909
I'm on God's side now.

34
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,980
Give us the phone, Percy.

35
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:12,715
Man, why are you all treating me
like I'm some little punk kid?

36
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,978
Besides, the Lord says:

37
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:18,080
"He who is without sin cast the first stone."

38
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:23,385
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- It slipped.

39
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,088
Where's the damn phone at?

40
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,236
Holy cow!

41
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:39,810
It's a musical cow. Look at it. It's a miracle.

42
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:42,073
Like the parting of the Red Sea.

43
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:45,412
Or the time I saw Mike Tyson's face
in a taco.

44
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:47,786
What is he doing?

45
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:51,488
No. I know he's not about to do that.
Come on, man.

46
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:53,582
He gonna really put his hand up that cow?

47
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:56,786
You can't do that.
It's against the cow's rights, man.

48
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,154
What's up with the...

49
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:01,563
All the way... In the hand...

50
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,742
It's for you.

51
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:20,044
Hello.

52
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:23,051
Hey, Morgan. Calm down, man.

53
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:26,886
All units, stand by for the whereabouts
of our friend Morgan Ball.

54
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:48,838
They're coming in.

55
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,184
Texas Rangers looking for Morgan Ball!
Sure hope we don't have the wrong house!

56
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:55,652
Go to hell!

57
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,147
Morgan, don't run.

58
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,370
Eddie Zane, FBI.
How the hell did that fire start?

59
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,036
I don't know. We heard some shots.

60
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,615
- Who's in there?
- Sharp and Swanson.

61
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:58,978
Christ.

62
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,287
You know what's in those barrels, right?

63
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:10,862
One wrong shot and we could all go.

64
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:15,398
Look, Ball, you have three choices:

65
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:19,171
A: You could stay in this hellhole
and burn to death.

66
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:23,302
B: You can come with us
and testify against John Cortland.

67
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,035
A and B suck.

68
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:26,868
What about C?

69
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,306
C is my personal favorite.

70
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,582
Take it easy.

71
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:34,209
I'm sure there's a way
we can work out this whole thing.

72
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,084
Seems like it's pretty well worked out to me.

73
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,556
I got money. Lots of money.

74
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:42,451
If you get me out of here,
I'll make you both rich.

75
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:45,622
Look, see this key? It's yours.

76
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,722
Thank you. I'll put that in evidence.

77
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:51,964
Look, I can't testify.
Cortland will kill me. It's a death sentence.

78
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:57,133
Let's go outside and talk it over.

79
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,995
You gotta be kidding me.

80
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,422
Nice job, Sharp.

81
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,293
What's that they say?
"Texas Rangers always get their man"?

82
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,232
That's the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

83
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,363
You both have funny hats and funny boots.
Who can tell you apart?

84
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:29,168
- Long time, Eddie.
- More than five years.

85
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:32,676
Margaret Swanson, Eddie Zane.
He's with the Federal Bureau of Idiots.

86
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:36,009
I'd have become a Ranger
if they said my partner would look like you.

87
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:39,084
If you were a Ranger,
you'd have caught this bastard by yourself.

88
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,313
That's the beautiful thing
about working for the federal government.

89
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:44,218
Other people do your grunt work for you.

90
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:50,123
- How's your daughter doing?
- Real good.

91
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:51,924
Excuse me, I'm bleeding here.

92
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:55,795
Get down!

93
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,736
You're gonna be okay.

94
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:06,437
Just hang in there. EMT is on the way.

95
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:11,700
Oh, my God, you guys. It is so hot out there.

96
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:13,533
I'm so hot, I think I'm sweaty.

97
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:16,972
Oh, God. I need to get some air.

98
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:25,147
Oh, my God. You guys, come here.

99
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:27,148
- What?
- Just come here.

100
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,253
Guys, come here.

101
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:34,288
I think this guy got mugged or something.

102
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:35,451
- What?
- Where?

103
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,756
- Should we call the cops?
- No.

104
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:41,992
I think this guy's coming to help him.

105
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:49,267
<i>Once again, put it together...</i>

106
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:54,210
<i>for the lovely ladies</i>
<i>of your Texas Longhorn cheer squad.</i>

107
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:07,622
What the hell happened?

108
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,992
I heard a shot.
I turned the corner, I got clipped.

109
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,589
- Did you get a good look at him?
- No.

110
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:31,141
Hello.

111
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,046
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

112
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,551
- I ordered for you.
- Good.

113
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:38,646
- Medium rare, right?
- Yeah.

114
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,494
How's school?

115
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:45,994
You know. The usual.

116
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:47,955
How's your mom?

117
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:52,269
I wouldn't really know.
She and Keith took up scuba diving.

118
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:56,831
Anyway, she was cleaning the house
and she wanted you to have these.

119
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:06,040
This is a beautiful picture of you
and your mom there in little bathing suits.

120
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,143
Oh, there's that donkey.

121
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:14,853
I keep looking for a picture of you and me,
but I guess I was always taking the pictures.

122
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,226
No, you were just never there.

123
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:19,257
Or that.

124
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:26,303
So, I'm applying to a few colleges.
Rice, SMU and...

125
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:28,465
Sharp.

126
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:31,871
Yeah, I'm on my way.

127
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,513
- Look, I've got to...
- Go. I get it.

128
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:43,847
Sorry.

129
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,784
I'm fine.

130
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,697
- Looks like you've been busy.
- Yes, sir.

131
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,663
- Hell, ain't it?
- Yes, sir.

132
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,975
They said you had some witnesses.

133
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,544
Yeah, they came waltzing in here
about a half hour ago.

134
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:08,044
Said they saw the whole thing.

135
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:10,274
- Anybody else know about this?
- No.

136
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:13,146
Can we keep it that way?
I'm tired of being shot at.

137
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:14,480
You bet.

138
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:16,652
Who are your witnesses?

139
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:18,689
Cheerleaders.

140
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,324
<i>You know, I think we could be on the news.</i>

141
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:27,365
<i>I'm not talking local.</i>
<i>I'm thinking maybe Katie Couric or Oprah.</i>

142
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:29,700
<i>We shouldn't have come here.</i>

143
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:31,335
<i>I need to get to the library.</i>

144
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:35,203
<i>Now I'll never get my psych paper done.</i>
<i>I'll just keep seeing his head explode.</i>

145
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:36,797
<i>Evie, remember what we said?</i>

146
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:40,936
<i>You got to breathe.</i>
<i>Let air in, and now let that air out, okay?</i>

147
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,105
I totally have a double chin.

148
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,341
I don't trust cops.

149
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,816
We shouldn't say anything
till our lawyers get here.

150
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,547
<i>We don't need lawyers.</i>
<i>We didn't do anything.</i>

151
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:52,783
<i>Relax, everybody.</i>
<i>We just came here to tell them what we saw.</i>

152
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,917
- Do we have to?
- Yes.

153
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:58,595
As cheerleaders,
we're role models to the community at large.

154
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:01,393
If we don't do the right thing,
how can we expect others to?

155
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,058
Now I'm gonna throw up.

156
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,796
I'm not gonna be staying here all night long.

157
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:09,568
Why don't we just tell these people
that we need to reschedule for tomorrow?

158
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:12,007
Well, I can't do morning.
I'm having my legs waxed.

159
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,806
I have a biochem lab at noon.

160
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,007
I'm good between 2:30 and 4:00.
Would that work for everybody?

161
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:18,743
Don't work for me.

162
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,178
And who are you?

163
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,687
Roland Sharp, Texas Ranger.

164
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:25,752
Oh, my God. Do you know Derek Jeter?

165
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:29,191
No, he means the other Texas Rangers.
You know, like the Lone Ranger.

166
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:32,389
He had that cool Indian friend.
What was his name?

167
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:33,590
Tonto?

168
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:36,827
He was hot.
Why don't guys wear loincloths anymore?

169
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:40,770
A Texas Ranger was shot this evening
in connection to the murder you witnessed.

170
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,273
Anything you remember,
no matter how insignificant...

171
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,673
may be of the utmost importance.

172
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,673
- Do you want a piece?
- No, I do not.

173
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,376
- You don't like gum?
- No.

174
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:57,444
Chewing gum is the most significant factor
in the decline of Western civilization.

175
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:58,818
The decline of what?

176
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:01,791
When people chew gum,
nobody can read their expressions.

177
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,452
Like with BOTOX.

178
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:15,230
I like an older man
who knows what he wants.

179
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:17,538
All right.

180
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:20,368
We should so not get involved in this.

181
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,504
Oh, God, here she goes again.

182
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:24,980
- She do this a lot?
- Whenever she gets nervous.

183
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:27,552
She drops, like, 10 pounds around finals.

184
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,644
Can anybody describe the perpetrator?

185
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,120
"Perpetrator"?

186
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:33,591
The bad man with the gun.

187
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,760
Actually, he was kind of cute.

188
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:40,161
Gross. He was a total skank.
On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give him a 4.

189
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:43,393
No, a ruthless killer's kind of sexy.
I give him an 8.

190
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,232
Let's try to concentrate. How tall was he?

191
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,033
Average. Like, 5'10".

192
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,903
No way. 6'2" at least.

193
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,738
I thought he was kind of short.

194
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,436
What about his hair?

195
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,103
Definitely needs to rethink his cut.

196
00:16:55,214 --> 00:17:00,049
- I mean the color of his hair.
- It was dark. Almost black.

197
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:01,449
I thought it was blond.

198
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:04,044
- What?
- This is bad.

199
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:07,051
Did he have any...

200
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:10,954
distinctive facial characteristics?

201
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:20,105
Sideburns? A mustache?

202
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:23,807
- There might've been a mustache.
- No, definitely not.

203
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,534
Was I the only one who saw a goatee?

204
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,220
Look at these guys.

205
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,050
You guys, wait.

206
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:49,891
Wait. Looks like your ex-boyfriend,
Brook Burton.

207
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:51,625
No, he doesn't.

208
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:54,838
Morning, Cap.

209
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:56,740
The Dixie Chicks here...

210
00:17:56,842 --> 00:18:01,472
looked at 5,759 mug shots last night.

211
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:06,480
<i>Wee. Look at this bad boy.</i>

212
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,008
<i>He is yummy!</i>

213
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,886
<i>He's kind of a cross between</i>
<i>the Unabomber and Mark Wahlberg.</i>

214
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,825
I now know the hottie rating
of every ex-convict...

215
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,125
in the western United States.

216
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,697
Been up all night,
haven't learned a goddamn thing.

217
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,994
<i>Please tell me this sweet thing</i>
<i>is out on parole.</i>

218
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,006
<i>Look at him. He's fine.</i>

219
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,075
<i>Girl, good.</i>

220
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:33,508
<i>Oh, my God, you guys,</i>
<i>I think this guy is in my poli- sci class.</i>

221
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,412
They all said they could ID that feller
if they saw him again.

222
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:48,191
That's a two-way mirror, girl.
People are watching you.

223
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,920
I know.

224
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:55,626
What do you think?

225
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:01,564
I don't know what to think.

226
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,506
I feel really...

227
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:13,642
old.

228
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:17,919
Excuse me, Captain.

229
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:22,187
The Governor's office just called.

230
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:24,954
Good.

231
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,728
Thanks for coming, fellas.

232
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,798
I'm getting phone calls from some daddies
that are worried about their daughters.

233
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,878
They have good reason to be concerned, sir.

234
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:43,539
If Cortland finds out there are witnesses,
he'll come after them sure as hell.

235
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:47,380
Gentlemen, I told those guys we'd take care
of their daughters. Stay with them.

236
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:49,647
- Yes, sir.
- Good luck, Roland.

237
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:21,010
Is the taller blond Anne or Barb?
I can't remember their names.

238
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,677
- HE-BAT.
- "He" what?

239
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,483
HE-BAT. It's a mnemonic device, son.

240
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,525
Heather, Evie, Barbara, Anne, Teresa.
HE-BAT.

241
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,125
This is a plainclothes operation.

242
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,255
Take your hat off. Conceal your badge.
Try to look normal.

243
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:37,529
Yes, sir. And I just want to say thank you
for taking me along on this one, sir.

244
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,729
That's the third time today
you've thanked me...

245
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:43,968
and I can honestly say at this point
I feel the full brunt of your gratitude.

246
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,575
Thank you again, sir.

247
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:48,407
Get in the damn van.

248
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:50,915
You, move over.

249
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:55,883
You think you could turn some music on
or something?

250
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,858
- Turn the motor off.
- Problem, sir?

251
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:05,429
We don't have a secure cabin.

252
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:08,397
This vehicle will not move
until all these ladies buckle up.

253
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,626
You're kidding, right?

254
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:14,297
One thing you'll learn about me is
I do not kid, or jest, or joke, or jape...

255
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:15,867
or quip.

256
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:23,508
Looks like we're waiting on you, Teresa.

257
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:25,914
I saw that.

258
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:34,216
I saw that, too.

259
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:37,986
I see everything.

260
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:50,969
Mr. Cortland, do you expect
any further charges to be filed against you?

261
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:54,136
Mr. Cortland,
how do you feel about the verdict?

262
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:56,009
After failing to produce any evidence...

263
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:59,277
the government has dropped all charges
against John W. Cortland.

264
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:02,046
Needless to say,
my client is pleased with this outcome.

265
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,952
What about the murder
of a key government witness last night?

266
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:08,356
If you'll excuse us, Mr. Cortland
is anxious to get home to his family.

267
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,722
No further comment.

268
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,989
Are you denying any prior knowledge?

269
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:27,211
Zane.

270
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:30,338
<i>It's me. I still don't have the money</i>
<i>Ball stole from me.</i>

271
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:32,974
<i>And the shooter you brought in</i>
<i>shot a Ranger.</i>

272
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:35,144
I covered for him. The job got done.

273
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:38,279
<i>Even shot myself in the arm.</i>
<i>You're a free man.</i>

274
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:41,826
Yeah, well, here's the thing.
You left some witnesses.

275
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:43,959
Hey, pull up over here.

276
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:53,428
Now you listen here.
You better start cleaning this mess up.

277
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:55,563
Already on it.

278
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:33,105
I got to shower.

279
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:36,271
Triple-lock all the doors,
put magnetic contacts on all the windows.

280
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:37,746
I only want one port of entry.

281
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:41,649
Y'all can put your audio and visual stuff
upstairs and downstairs.

282
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:45,780
I want you to check all the crawl spaces,
if they got any, for outside access.

283
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:50,089
Put a tap on that telephone and a bunch
of Barq's Root Beer in the refrigerator.

284
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:51,787
Where do you want your stuff at, sir?

285
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:53,956
On the couch in the front room,
facing the door.

286
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:56,556
Yes, sir. Where do we bed down, sir?

287
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:59,997
With that bunch of scholars over there.

288
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:08,206
Have fun.

289
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:19,016
Ladies, if I might have y'all assemble
in the living area.

290
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:37,909
Is my root beer in the refrigerator?

291
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,300
Root beer? No, sir.

292
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:42,346
Then why are you still here?

293
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:48,252
Antonio? Baby! Where are you?

294
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:51,083
- It's her boyfriend.
- It's a very codependent relationship.

295
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:54,317
Well, at least I have a relationship.
What do you have? Nothing.

296
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:57,259
Antonio.
Teresa's gonna have to get back to you.

297
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:06,365
You couldn't possibly be talking about
my mother because she's allergic to dogs.

298
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:09,736
- First rule: no cellphones.
- What?

299
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:13,743
No pagers, no Palm Pilots and no e-mail.

300
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:18,111
And the telephone downstairs may be used
in the event of emergencies only.

301
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:19,581
Give it up.

302
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:22,584
Send us back to the Stone Age,
why don't you?

303
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,780
You don't understand
what serious business this is.

304
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:28,018
In order for us to do our job,
we're gonna need your cooperation...

305
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:30,185
and that means paying attention
to what I say...

306
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:32,763
and doing what I ask you to do
when I ask you to do it.

307
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:36,766
Furthermore, I'd appreciate it
if you'd cover yourselves in our presence.

308
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,631
I realize how very proud you are...

309
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:41,763
of your tattoos, piercings,
and other body modifications.

310
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:44,501
However, my colleagues and I
do not need to see these.

311
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:45,837
Are there any questions?

312
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:48,777
I have one. Are you always such a dick?

313
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:51,883
Yes. There will be no guests
in the house ever.

314
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:54,884
Nobody may leave the house
without an escort.

315
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:56,476
But this is our house.

316
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:59,421
What about classes?
I'm in an advanced pre-med program.

317
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:01,719
- I have a--
- 4.0, we know.

318
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:05,887
Okay, guys. If I miss my biochem class,
I'm gonna lose my scholarship.

319
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:07,624
There are five of y'all, three of us.

320
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:10,997
You'll have to pare your schedules down
to the absolute essentials.

321
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:13,627
I'll skip all my classes
for the greater good of the group.

322
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:14,966
Work it out amongst yourselves.

323
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:18,270
- What about dates? Barb's got two tonight.
- Not anymore.

324
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:20,776
Hello! We've got a game on Saturday.

325
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:23,074
Don't even think about telling us
we're not going.

326
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:24,478
You're not going.

327
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:25,880
Don't say it.

328
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:30,614
As captain of this squad, I must inform you
that to stop us from cheerleading...

329
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:34,658
you're gonna have to pry the pom-poms
from our cold, dead hands.

330
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:53,811
I'm all clear.

331
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:58,913
Come on, Asst. Cheerleading Coach Sharp,
show me your spirit.

332
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:00,575
Where's your happy face?

333
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:02,482
This is my happy face.

334
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:06,854
Well, I think we're gonna have to turn
that frown upside down.

335
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:12,095
Now this cannot be how you helped
Florida State to the regional finals.

336
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:14,857
- Coach Beauregard?
- Please, Binky.

337
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,297
Okay, Binky.

338
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:18,562
I specialize in strength and conditioning...

339
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:21,901
and I'm gonna leave the grinning
and the smiling up to you.

340
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:25,943
Well, okey-dokey then.
Assignment accepted.

341
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:31,743
<i>Time-out...</i>

342
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,076
<i>Texas.</i>

343
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:14,515
Gun!

344
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:31,301
A water gun, sir.

345
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:33,570
Please don't hurt me. It's just a joke.

346
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:43,949
Nice hit!

347
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,205
Check it out.

348
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:43,971
Howdy, neighbor.

349
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:46,717
I'm Jimmy from next door.

350
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:50,521
Just wanted to come by
and welcome you to the building.

351
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:54,852
And, you know,
if you need any weed or anything...

352
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:57,985
just come bang on my door.

353
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:01,723
That's good to know, Jimmy.

354
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:04,834
- You'll definitely be hearing from us.
- Cool.

355
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:09,704
2200 hours.

356
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,400
<i>HE-BAT is secure.</i>

357
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:14,376
Roger that. We'll see y'all in the morning.

358
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:29,192
I don't sleep.

359
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:34,197
Isn't that your partner?

360
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:40,701
- Shouldn't you have gone to the hospital?
- No.

361
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:42,934
I'm here.

362
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,400
Right. But she's been shot.

363
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:47,408
That's part of the job.

364
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,442
You ever kill anyone, Sharp?

365
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:09,861
Cold bastard probably doesn't even care.

366
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:19,210
Her middle name is Ellen.

367
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:24,673
A lot of the fellas weren't happy when
the Rangers started recruiting women...

368
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:27,012
and I was sure enough one of them.

369
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:31,717
She changed my mind.

370
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:37,892
I also hear everything.

371
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:43,456
"The brightness of her cheek
would shame those stars

372
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,661
"As daylight doth a lamp

373
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:48,068
"her eyes in heaven

374
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:50,470
"Would through the airy region
stream so bright

375
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:54,136
"That birds would sing
and think it were not night"

376
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:59,382
So your assignment is
to write a five-page paper...

377
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,247
due a week from Friday...

378
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:04,515
describing the function
of the recurrent imagery...

379
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:07,785
of light against darkness
in <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

380
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:10,986
What does it mean? How does it mean it?

381
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:14,358
And is it possible that this play...

382
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:18,060
is more than just a teenage romance
with a sad ending?

383
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:25,504
Miss Thompson.
I want to see you in my office. Now.

384
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:37,448
- She'd like to see you.
- What for?

385
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:39,022
I don't know.

386
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:46,389
Mr. Sharp. Come in. Have a seat.

387
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:55,131
So, I understand you're
the new assistant cheerleading coach.

388
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:56,263
That's right.

389
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:58,274
May I ask what you were doing in my class?

390
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:02,676
That's the way we do things on our squad.
If somebody's in the--

391
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,839
Let me be blunt, Mr. Sharp.

392
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:08,043
Barb's cheerleading
is interfering with her work.

393
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:11,652
And for the record, you should know
I think cheerleading is stupid.

394
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:14,054
I couldn't agree with you more.

395
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:19,286
She downloaded this paper
on plant imagery in <i>Macbeth</i>...

396
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:20,996
off the Internet.

397
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:25,229
I know, because I wrote it 20 years ago
when I was an undergraduate.

398
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,728
Must be a hell of a paper.

399
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:31,173
Yes, I thought it was pretty good.

400
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:36,236
But that is not the point.
Plagiarism is simply not acceptable.

401
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:39,015
I've given Barb an F on that assignment.

402
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:42,917
If she wants to remain on the squad,
or in the school, for that matter...

403
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:46,684
her next paper on <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>
had better be wholly original.

404
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:48,520
I'll explain your position to Barb...

405
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:51,857
and make sure she understands it,
explicitly.

406
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:54,562
Well, good.

407
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:57,225
Fine.

408
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:03,232
Okay, what's the big deal?
Presidents don't write their speeches.

409
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:06,970
When you're President, you can be
as lenient as you want to on plagiarism.

410
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:09,069
But wait. This play has five acts.

411
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,205
She can't expect me to read the whole thing.

412
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:13,977
It's all written in ye olde
weird English anyway.

413
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:16,713
- Hey, Barb.
- Hi, Scoot.

414
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:21,387
Besides, people think being a cheerleader
is this nonstop party and everything...

415
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:23,357
but, you know, they're so wrong.

416
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,292
- Hey, Barb.
- Hi, Chase.

417
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:27,894
Aside from all my games and my practices...

418
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:31,901
they still expect me to maintain
this 2.0 average, and I can't do that.

419
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:33,664
You need to manage your time better.

420
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:37,070
Time? What time? I don't have any time.

421
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:39,541
- Hey, Barb.
- Hi, Tim.

422
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:42,579
- Tom.
- Shoot! Sorry. Tom.

423
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:44,308
I really liked him, too.

424
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,906
You got some admirers on this campus,
don't you?

425
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:49,646
Don't be jealous. They're just silly boys.

426
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,655
We can stop this charade
and run away together.

427
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,554
You got a paper to write.

428
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:57,219
I know. But if I write it myself,
it'll just be stupid.

429
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:59,262
You don't know that
because you haven't tried.

430
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:01,627
Cheating is a hell of a lot worse
than being stupid.

431
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:06,192
Plagiarism is an academic crime.
It is punishable by academic death.

432
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,364
What do you care anyway?

433
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:13,535
I wanna see you stay alive, academically,
physically, and every other way.

434
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,538
- You like me, don't you?
- No.

435
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:51,415
<i>Guys, stand by one moment.</i>

436
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,515
Sergeant, your pizza's here.

437
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,649
Roger that.

438
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:01,253
Set the pizza on the porch...

439
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,954
take two steps back,
and place your hands behind your head.

440
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:23,707
What's the problem, dude?

441
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:26,510
If that pizza's hot,
there won't be any problem.

442
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:41,254
- All right, what do I owe you?
- $13.75.

443
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:49,101
Hey, do you live here with all these girls?

444
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,605
Temporarily.

445
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:52,743
Dude, you're my new hero.

446
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:56,206
Imagine what that means to me.

447
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:04,912
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

448
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:09,250
Without my phone, I am nothing,
I am worthless.

449
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:11,859
I need to speak to my Antonio...

450
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,995
- What is that?
- The Carnivore.

451
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:23,235
Pepperoni, sausage, ground beef, ham, and
olive loaf, all together in one savory pie.

452
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:26,265
With jalapeños.

453
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:28,545
- Want some?
- Yes. No.

454
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,505
Extra-thick crust.

455
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:32,674
- I can't. I'm on the Zone.
- What zone?

456
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:35,377
The proper combination
of protein, fat, and carbohydrates.

457
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:37,317
This combination's proper as hell.

458
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,854
I'm a total Atkins girl.

459
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:40,218
I do Weight Watchers.

460
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:43,122
You'll probably blow all your daily points
with just one bite.

461
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:47,789
This baby has one point and one point only,
and that is tasting good.

462
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:52,665
I don't know why you girls are on a diet.
You couldn't weigh any more than--

463
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:54,769
Don't even go there.

464
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:57,466
No, there are some things
we just don't discuss.

465
00:37:57,575 --> 00:37:59,509
My daughter has a very healthy appetite.

466
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,771
Interesting. You never mentioned
you had a daughter.

467
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:03,176
- What's her name?
- Emma.

468
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,873
- How old is she?
- Seventeen.

469
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:06,643
- Is she a cheerleader?
- I hope not.

470
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:09,618
- What's her favorite band?
- You got me.

471
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,119
How about her sign?

472
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:12,950
Is she sexually active?

473
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:14,888
- Hell, no.
- She probably is.

474
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:17,654
68% of high-school students
in Texas have had sex...

475
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:19,662
by the time they've reached the 12th grade.

476
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:21,994
Slightly higher than the national average.

477
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:23,532
Thank you for ruining my day.

478
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:26,967
I'll tell you one thing about this daughter
you know nothing about.

479
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:31,098
She must be supremely messed up
in the head from living in a house with you.

480
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:32,835
She lives with her mother.

481
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:34,467
Why did your marriage fall apart?

482
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:37,138
That's one of many things
that you and I will never discuss.

483
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:40,547
You see, you clearly don't know
how to speak to women.

484
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:44,382
I know how to speak to women.
I clearly choose not to.

485
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:18,417
We need to establish
this bathroom at the end of the hall...

486
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,456
is a 100% masculine bathroom.

487
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:24,722
From this moment on, it is off-limits to
you people and your foolish undergarments.

488
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:27,457
- You want an egg-white omelet?
- Does that mean no yolks?

489
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:28,998
- No yolks.
- No, thanks.

490
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,863
- Want some kamut flakes?
- What?

491
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:34,267
- Ancient grain. Tastes great with soymilk.
- Soymilk.

492
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:40,101
- Who ate all my kamut flakes?
- Not me.

493
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:44,342
What am I,
the Organization to End World Hunger?

494
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:46,780
This is my cereal.

495
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:51,514
Why do you girls find it necessary
to listen to this constant crap?

496
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:53,817
You don't like vagina music?

497
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:57,416
Do you have to use that word
before I've had my coffee and soymilk?

498
00:39:57,528 --> 00:40:00,053
- Vagina.
- Whose?

499
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:04,464
- What did I tell y'all about wearing clothes?
- Jog bras are clothes.

500
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,033
That's it.

501
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:09,773
That is it.

502
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:41,667
Just sign right there.

503
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:44,570
- Awful big unit for a house this size.
- I get hot.

504
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:46,040
I hear you.

505
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:14,303
All right. You win, okay?
We all agree to put on more clothes.

506
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:16,305
Now, can you please
turn the temperature up?

507
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:19,035
That's a very mature decision
and I'm proud of you girls.

508
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,202
But we should come
to a common understanding...

509
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:24,338
the meaning, the definition
of the word "more."

510
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:26,673
We thought you might say that.

511
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,876
Barb!

512
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:34,047
All righty.
This is Courtney Ryan, my personal hero.

513
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:38,694
Like Courtney, we feel we should not
be penalized for maximizing our assets.

514
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:42,163
However, we've all agreed to cover up...

515
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:44,462
these areas here...

516
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:46,529
and this area right here.

517
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:47,695
Good.

518
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,974
But what about these other problem areas?

519
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:54,137
Here...

520
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:56,139
here...

521
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:58,243
and here.

522
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:01,210
You're killing me.

523
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:04,684
Come here.

524
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:13,894
All right. We'll cave on the first two.

525
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:16,432
But we absolutely must maintain
navel visibility.

526
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,593
We want to be realistic, not Amish.

527
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,636
- One inch on either side.
- Three.

528
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:22,103
- Two.
- Done.

529
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:35,475
<i>These girls are a different kettle of worms.</i>

530
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:38,487
Something just came up. I'll get back to you.

531
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:42,157
I need to speak to your witnesses.

532
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,793
Eddie, how's the arm?

533
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:49,893
Let's not change the subject.

534
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,490
There are no witnesses.

535
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:54,628
Even if there was, I couldn't let you
talk to them. You know that.

536
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:57,468
Come on, Captain,
we're on the same team here.

537
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,270
I think I can help.

538
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,512
At least let me talk to Sharp.
That was him on the phone, right?

539
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:04,911
Sharp's in the field right now.

540
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:06,642
Right.

541
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:10,411
Your Ranger screwed up my whole case.

542
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:12,986
He blew up that lab
and all the evidence in it.

543
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,888
Ball is dead
and I got shot in the arm, for Christ's sake.

544
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:20,555
I need to speak to those witnesses.
So I'm asking you again. Where are they?

545
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:30,363
This "One Riot, One Ranger" shit won't fly
when I slap a subpoena on your desk.

546
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:32,374
My desk's already a mess.

547
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:35,775
One more piece of paper
won't make me no never mind.

548
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:41,216
Circle the wagons if you want.
This is a federal case.

549
00:44:03,707 --> 00:44:06,335
- You learn quick.
- Five years of college.

550
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:09,310
$13.75, right? Here's $14. Keep the change.

551
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:19,483
How's my favorite pep-squad leader?

552
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:20,579
What?

553
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:22,989
I said, how's my favorite pep-squad leader?

554
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:26,859
Not real peppy.
Would somebody turn that music down?

555
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:28,924
Hang on, Cap.

556
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:31,058
Is there any more pizza left?

557
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:38,000
Somebody, please turn that music off!

558
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:39,666
Throw this away.

559
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:47,640
I cannot hear myself think.

560
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:54,514
Okay, as we involuntarily enter
into this enforced period of silence...

561
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:57,116
can I ask if there's any medication
you forgot to take...

562
00:44:57,227 --> 00:44:59,252
or some I might recommend you should try?

563
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,558
Yes. Like take a chill pill.

564
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:03,527
I only need one witness.

565
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:04,828
Get out.

566
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:07,963
What's up, Cap?

567
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:11,473
It's a subpoena from your buddy Zane.
The feds want our witnesses.

568
00:45:11,575 --> 00:45:13,770
<i>We're now officially in contempt.</i>

569
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:17,813
Don't worry. If Cortland don't send
somebody to kill them soon, I'll do it myself.

570
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:21,851
One other thing.
I got this invoice here for an air conditioner.

571
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:26,386
$7,572.44.

572
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:27,650
Can you explain that to me?

573
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:29,589
I'll have to get back to you on that one.

574
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:31,251
Where do you think you're going?

575
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:33,693
To the Cactus Cafe.
Asleep at the Wheel's playing.

576
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:36,766
Too many people. You know the rules.
Nobody goes out after dark.

577
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:40,303
We're young, we're strong,
and we're tired of being cooped up.

578
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:43,100
I haven't had phone sex with my boyfriend
in almost a week.

579
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:44,435
I have oats to plow.

580
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:46,634
You got oats to sow,
and it ain't gonna happen.

581
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:51,181
Like hell it's not. What's to stop me
from walking out that door? The <i>Tontos</i>?

582
00:45:51,281 --> 00:45:53,010
I eat men like that for breakfast.

583
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:56,712
And what, you?
I'd like to see you try it, Mr. Ranger-man.

584
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:00,183
Come on.

585
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:17,933
Anybody else wanna go see
Asleep at the Wheel?

586
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,470
You think he needs backup?

587
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:25,570
No.

588
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:28,508
I think he can handle it.

589
00:46:40,197 --> 00:46:43,792
Let me guess, Clay.
You're looking for Jimmy.

590
00:46:45,702 --> 00:46:49,365
Totally. Dude, are you like a psychic
or some kind of shit?

591
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:51,834
Some kind of shit.

592
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:53,476
The thing is...

593
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,176
Jimmy moved.

594
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:58,014
- Where to?
- Travis County Jailhouse.

595
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:00,474
That ain't good.

596
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:12,091
Okay, a hairdo this phenomenal
only happens twice a year.

597
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:15,632
Please. It really needs to be shared
with the world.

598
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:18,564
- What if we have to go to the bathroom?
- Go ahead.

599
00:47:18,802 --> 00:47:20,360
You're evil, you know that?

600
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:22,768
Face it, girl. You're with me tonight.

601
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:24,568
We didn't ask for this.

602
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,439
We just went into the bathroom
and saw a guy die.

603
00:47:27,544 --> 00:47:31,480
We could've kept quiet, but we didn't.
I feel like we're getting punished for it.

604
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:34,915
- Sorry, but you're not being punished.
- Then let us out of here.

605
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:38,249
Even prisoners on death row
get a little yard time.

606
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:41,716
- How about the mall?
- Shopping with y'all? I don't think so.

607
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:44,191
- What about a movie?
- Not in the mood.

608
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:47,889
As captain of the cheerleading squad,
I demand that you take us someplace...

609
00:47:47,998 --> 00:47:51,161
where you can protect us
and we can have some fun.

610
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:20,457
Look who's skating!

611
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:33,076
Last time I was here, it was Emma's
sixth birthday. She loved this place.

612
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:34,939
You don't speak to her much, do you?

613
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:36,842
I don't think Emma wants to talk to me.

614
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:40,883
Every girl wants to talk to her dad.
She may act like she doesn't, but she does.

615
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:44,750
Everything I say around her is wrong.
I've been wrong since she turned 11.

616
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:47,790
Maybe you're just not asking her
the right questions.

617
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:50,485
First of all, never ask, "So how's school?"

618
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:53,893
Nope. Dumb question. It's too easy.
Our brains just shut off.

619
00:48:53,997 --> 00:48:57,956
And don't become her best friend.
We have enough friends, thank you.

620
00:48:58,068 --> 00:48:59,797
What do you wish you could say to her?

621
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,996
That I wish I could see her more...

622
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:05,233
and I'm sorry it didn't work out
between her mother and me...

623
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:08,277
and it wasn't her fault, and stuff like that.

624
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:11,609
If my daddy told me them things,
I'd be the happiest girl alive.

625
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:14,377
I haven't seen my dad
since he left me nine years ago.

626
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:15,883
I'm sorry that happened to you.

627
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:18,614
You have a daughter and you love her.
You should tell her.

628
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:22,021
Yeah, maybe you should take her
skating again, because you know what?

629
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:24,218
You're getting pretty good.

630
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:26,228
I am getting the hang of it.

631
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:30,630
All right, we're going to let you go.
Show us your funky groove. Come on, boy!

632
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:34,804
All right! Yes, sir!

633
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:41,841
- Are you okay?
- That was bad.

634
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:50,820
Morning, Emma.

635
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:52,248
Mr. Zane?

636
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:54,415
Look at you, you're all grown up.

637
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:56,856
Yeah. Wow, it's been a long time.

638
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,018
Sure has.

639
00:49:58,128 --> 00:49:59,288
What are you doing here?

640
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:01,956
I'm looking for your father.
It's a professional matter.

641
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:03,828
You got any idea where I might find him?

642
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:06,402
No. He doesn't really tell me anything.

643
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,198
What happened to your arm?

644
00:50:08,305 --> 00:50:11,001
It's just one of the hazards of the job.

645
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:13,807
You wouldn't happen
to have a number on him, would you?

646
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:15,002
Is he in trouble?

647
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:18,309
No. It's just that I'm working on a case
and I need his help.

648
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:20,246
If I need to get ahold of him...

649
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:24,252
I usually call dispatch and
they patch me through on a restricted line.

650
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:26,583
- I'll give that a try then.
- Okay.

651
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,817
- Good to see you again.
- Bye.

652
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:35,089
Sharp, look here.

653
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:38,835
Remember that John Doe
they pulled out of a rest stop last week?

654
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:41,904
Rifle from his trunk matches the bullet
they dug out of Swanson.

655
00:50:42,005 --> 00:50:44,701
Is this the fella y'all see shoot Morgan Ball?

656
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:48,175
No. The guy who shot Ball
seemed a lot nicer.

657
00:50:48,278 --> 00:50:49,836
And a lot less dead.

658
00:50:49,946 --> 00:50:52,312
- It was like Ball knew him or something.
- Knew him?

659
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:56,147
Yeah. If you're through playing detective,
can you get us home so we can rest?

660
00:50:56,253 --> 00:50:57,311
Nope.

661
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:58,885
- Please?
- Come on.

662
00:50:59,122 --> 00:51:00,316
Load up.

663
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:23,035
Yeah, I like that.
That's where we're gonna kill them.

664
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:27,281
Remind me to take a collection
right after that.

665
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:30,046
That's gonna be a good time
to get the money.

666
00:51:30,153 --> 00:51:32,747
Well, if it ain't Martin Luther Vandross.

667
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:36,257
Why don't you all take a break.
Everybody go ahead, real quick.

668
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:39,419
This man's probably got
a lot of sins he needs to confess.

669
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:41,326
Probably may have to exorcise him.

670
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,592
Y'all go about your business.

671
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:46,702
Can't you see
I'm doing the Lord's business?

672
00:51:46,803 --> 00:51:48,430
You know this guy?

673
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,137
I mean, that is...

674
00:51:52,242 --> 00:51:55,405
He got roughed up.
That is pretty bad right there.

675
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:57,770
- Is he dead?
- He way dead.

676
00:51:58,482 --> 00:52:01,815
Yeah, I mean, looks like a guy
that was in the can with me.

677
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:04,916
Think his name's Jack Carter.

678
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:06,249
He work for Cortland?

679
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:09,018
No. He was more of a freelance artist...

680
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:11,924
if you know what I'm saying.

681
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:18,466
Looks like Cortland hired a second shooter.
Pull up Jack Carter, see what we got on him.

682
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:23,233
So, you girls are cheerleaders, huh?

683
00:52:25,008 --> 00:52:28,068
Y'all recognize me? It's me, Percy.

684
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:32,008
Yeah. Percy "Pirouette"...

685
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,177
Stevens.

686
00:52:34,284 --> 00:52:37,583
Class of '89. I was bad. I was a bad man.

687
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:41,620
Y'all think that's funny? I'm good. Okay.

688
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:45,394
All right, you think that's funny?
You wait one second.

689
00:53:02,078 --> 00:53:05,377
"Ungawa, Texas got the power

690
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:07,677
"I said, yes"

691
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:13,786
Yeah, that was real fresh, Bobby Brown.

692
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:15,152
Oh, yeah?

693
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:17,590
Yeah, let me tell you something.

694
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,787
Now, I may have missed the '90s...

695
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:23,058
due to a previous engagement...

696
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:26,067
but back in my day, we brought it.

697
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:29,396
Oh, yeah. I'm talking real old school.

698
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:32,736
Not like that little tired crap you trot out to.

699
00:53:32,842 --> 00:53:36,073
A-G-G-I-E.

700
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:38,073
What's that spell?

701
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:39,808
What's that smell?

702
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:42,111
Ladies.

703
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,579
- All set?
- You bet.

704
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:50,126
"More power, more power
more power to the hour

705
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:53,924
"More bounce, more bounce
more bounce to the ounce"

706
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:55,258
Boring.

707
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:58,968
"Hot, now show us what you got"

708
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,319
Now that's old school.

709
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:12,908
<i>Hello?</i>

710
00:55:13,009 --> 00:55:13,976
- Hi, Emma, it's--
- <i>Psych!</i>

711
00:55:14,077 --> 00:55:16,443
<i>You got my machine. You know what to do.</i>

712
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,275
Hey, Emma, it's your father.

713
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:22,476
Dad.

714
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:26,121
I was just calling to see how you're doing.

715
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:29,919
It's kind of hard to reach me right now.
I'm working on a case.

716
00:55:31,795 --> 00:55:36,289
You know, like I'm always doing.
Just working on a case.

717
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:42,700
Anyway, I'd like to talk to you.
So call me. You know how to reach me.

718
00:55:43,873 --> 00:55:47,741
If you feel like it.
There's no pressure or anything like that.

719
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,308
You know.

720
00:55:54,784 --> 00:55:57,753
- So I guess that's it.
- Tell her you miss her.

721
00:55:58,722 --> 00:56:00,656
Except, I miss you, baby.

722
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:04,416
Can I help you?

723
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:06,659
Teresa had a visit from her little friend.

724
00:56:06,763 --> 00:56:09,231
What did I tell you people about visitors?

725
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:12,392
Not that kind of visitor. Her menses.

726
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:15,828
- The curse of Eve. The crimson tide.
- I get it.

727
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:19,534
So, someone has to go shopping.
Do you want me to go?

728
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:21,600
<i>Holt, get over here.</i>

729
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,770
<i>I'm going out for some air.</i>

730
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:35,086
<i>Attention.</i>
<i>Price check on register three, please.</i>

731
00:56:57,514 --> 00:56:59,448
Can't make up your mind?

732
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:04,280
Do I need the slim fit, the regular protection
or the one with wings?

733
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:07,481
The ones with the wings. Definitely.

734
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:13,458
Cucumber-melon body spray.

735
00:57:13,863 --> 00:57:16,093
Vanilla-smoothie bikini cream.

736
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:18,531
Sounds like a busy and painful night
for your wife.

737
00:57:18,635 --> 00:57:20,364
I'm divorced. These are for the girls.

738
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:23,598
The cheerleaders?
You do their shopping for them?

739
00:57:24,507 --> 00:57:27,101
You are a curious fella, Mr. Sharp. You gay?

740
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:29,701
No. Girls are all tied up, studying.

741
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:32,807
I volunteered to help out
and pick up a few things.

742
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:35,851
Are you sleeping with any
or possibly all of these girls?

743
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:36,919
No.

744
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,749
Wanna have dinner with me
tomorrow night?

745
00:57:38,855 --> 00:57:40,117
Negative.

746
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:44,252
- Negative?
- It's not really possible, with work and all.

747
00:57:45,228 --> 00:57:48,356
Well, okay, that plane just flew
into the side of the mountain.

748
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:51,798
Call off the search, no survivors.
Have a pleasant evening.

749
00:58:08,451 --> 00:58:09,850
These yours?

750
00:58:12,288 --> 00:58:14,415
- Yes.
- You left them on the counter.

751
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:16,121
Thank you.

752
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:25,531
Thank you.

753
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,898
I think I made a mistake back there.

754
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,369
Didn't want the wings after all?

755
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:32,270
No. In regard to dinner.
It's not that I don't want to.

756
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:34,969
It's hard for me to get away
with my busy schedule...

757
00:58:35,078 --> 00:58:37,979
as an assistant cheerleading coach.

758
00:58:38,581 --> 00:58:41,948
This whole cheerleading thing
must be a really tough racket.

759
00:58:42,051 --> 00:58:43,643
You have no idea.

760
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:45,418
Anyway, I was thinking...

761
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:49,322
maybe you could come over
to the house tomorrow and I'll fix dinner.

762
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:55,856
Okay.

763
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,427
- 8:00?
- Yeah, good.

764
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,472
By the way, I'm Molly.

765
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:09,208
I'm Roland.

766
00:59:15,685 --> 00:59:19,587
You're not on the Zone or counting points
or anything like that, are you?

767
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,379
No.

768
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:30,363
Is that the North Star?

769
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:35,436
No. I think that's an airplane.
You see the way it's moving?

770
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:38,637
That's the North Star.

771
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:41,608
So that's where they've been keeping it.

772
00:59:42,812 --> 00:59:45,406
Someday I want to do more
than look at the stars.

773
00:59:45,515 --> 00:59:47,710
I'm fixing to soar with them.

774
00:59:48,017 --> 00:59:50,679
What, you mean,
like an astronaut or something?

775
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:54,188
No, not exactly. Not a living one, at least.

776
00:59:54,724 --> 00:59:57,056
They got this company out of Beaumont...

777
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:00,027
and they will launch your remains
right out into outer space.

778
01:00:00,129 --> 01:00:02,324
Really? I love shit like that.

779
01:00:02,498 --> 01:00:04,898
- But how?
- What they do is they park you--

780
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:07,401
Holt, what the hell are you doing?

781
01:00:09,172 --> 01:00:12,232
Contemplating the vastness
of the universe, sir.

782
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:26,817
It's supposed to be red.
Does this look like red to you?

783
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:29,856
Just shoot her, Sharp.
You'd be doing her a favor.

784
01:00:30,393 --> 01:00:32,827
- Where are Teresa and Anne?
- I don't know.

785
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:34,362
You're lying.

786
01:00:34,864 --> 01:00:36,991
- How do you know?
- You broke eye contact.

787
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:39,568
It's a sign of stress and possible deception.

788
01:00:39,669 --> 01:00:42,399
So is picking at your clothes.
Stop picking at your clothes.

789
01:00:42,505 --> 01:00:44,700
Look me in the eye
and tell me where they're at.

790
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:46,798
Teresa and Antonio had a really big fight.

791
01:00:46,909 --> 01:00:50,538
She had to blow off some steam,
so they went to the Buffalo Billiards.

792
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:53,241
You stay here.

793
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:56,147
Don't be contemplating the universe
with anybody.

794
01:01:10,066 --> 01:01:12,967
Look, a native approaches.
Avoid eye contact.

795
01:01:17,974 --> 01:01:21,000
You guys are the cheerleaders, right?
The ones with the calendar?

796
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:22,168
Nope.

797
01:01:22,378 --> 01:01:25,370
Could have sworn you were June.
June kicks ass.

798
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:27,242
Sorry, wrong girl.

799
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:31,844
Well, me and my buddies over there,
we go to every game.

800
01:01:32,221 --> 01:01:33,552
Have you seen us?

801
01:01:33,656 --> 01:01:35,521
Yeah.

802
01:01:35,758 --> 01:01:38,090
I thought I recognized you guys.

803
01:01:38,294 --> 01:01:42,253
You guys were the ones getting really drunk
going, "woo, woo," right?

804
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:44,492
- You saw us.
- No.

805
01:01:45,401 --> 01:01:47,301
Your school spirit sucks.

806
01:01:47,403 --> 01:01:50,930
I'm captain of the cheer squad.
Our school spirit kicks ass.

807
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:54,999
Yeah, and it's getting hit on
by idiots like you that really sucks.

808
01:01:55,111 --> 01:01:57,511
You're a sassy bitch. I like that.

809
01:01:58,848 --> 01:02:01,043
- Get your hands--
- Hang on now.

810
01:02:01,818 --> 01:02:04,946
Everybody cool off.
We've had enough fun tonight.

811
01:02:07,423 --> 01:02:08,856
Now I've had enough fun.

812
01:02:08,958 --> 01:02:13,019
Was that completely necessary? You could
seriously injure a young man by doing that.

813
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:24,532
I should warn you.

814
01:02:25,141 --> 01:02:26,608
I know karate.

815
01:02:26,843 --> 01:02:28,868
You better know something.

816
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:34,080
Any of the rest of you boys here
wanna play the winner?

817
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:47,119
We had the situation under control.

818
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:50,825
Yeah. We were about to go all Buffy
on their gringo asses.

819
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:05,038
I brought you a pillow.

820
01:03:05,148 --> 01:03:07,343
It's better than the ones you've been using.

821
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:10,510
Buckwheat hulls. It's good for neck support.

822
01:03:11,053 --> 01:03:12,350
Thank you.

823
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:16,654
That was cool what you did for the girls.

824
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,125
It was cool.

825
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:22,794
That's one big honking bullet.

826
01:03:22,899 --> 01:03:25,265
You fixing to send a monkey up
in that thing?

827
01:03:25,368 --> 01:03:28,235
That thing
is a personnel suppressor deluxe.

828
01:03:28,704 --> 01:03:31,730
Personnel suppressor? You mean killing?

829
01:03:32,441 --> 01:03:35,877
Can't you just wound them or something?
Shoot the gun out of their hand?

830
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:37,707
No, it's impossible.

831
01:03:41,417 --> 01:03:44,113
You're not really the cheerleading type,
are you?

832
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:46,620
For me, it's more penance than a passion.

833
01:03:46,722 --> 01:03:49,953
Religious ascetics wear a hair shirt,
I carry the pom-poms.

834
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:52,026
I don't know.

835
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:55,660
I guess it's the duality of man, you know?

836
01:03:56,032 --> 01:03:58,057
"That Jungian thing, sir."

837
01:03:58,434 --> 01:04:00,299
Matthew Modine, <i>Full Metal Jacket</i>.

838
01:04:00,403 --> 01:04:03,304
Peace sign on one side of his helmet,
"Born to Kill" on the other.

839
01:04:03,406 --> 01:04:04,873
It's my favorite movie.

840
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:10,606
My favorite movie is <i>The Sound of Music</i>.

841
01:04:17,386 --> 01:04:18,978
"What's in a name?

842
01:04:19,388 --> 01:04:23,552
"that which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet"

843
01:04:24,227 --> 01:04:25,819
I don't understand any of this.

844
01:04:25,928 --> 01:04:29,557
Pretty simple, really.
She's a Capulet, he's a Montague.

845
01:04:29,665 --> 01:04:33,897
The two families have always hated each
other and they always will hate each other.

846
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:37,636
- Why couldn't Shakespeare say it like that?
- He could have.

847
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:40,800
But nobody would be talking about it
410 years later.

848
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:42,969
How do you know so much
about <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>?

849
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:44,205
I read the play.

850
01:04:44,313 --> 01:04:47,407
- Why would you read the play?
- Molly's coming over for dinner tonight.

851
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:48,744
Who's Molly?

852
01:04:48,851 --> 01:04:50,409
Professor McCarthy.

853
01:04:50,519 --> 01:04:51,918
You call her Molly?

854
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:55,115
This whole house totally reeks.
What is that smell?

855
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:58,022
Five Alarm Chili. It's my specialty.

856
01:04:58,594 --> 01:05:01,085
You're putting meat into my lentil pot?

857
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:03,091
He's making dinner for Molly.

858
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:04,564
Who's Molly?

859
01:05:04,667 --> 01:05:06,931
Professor McCarthy, Intro to English Lit.

860
01:05:07,036 --> 01:05:10,528
I had her last quarter. She's a babe.
And this is what you're serving her?

861
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,107
It's his specialty.

862
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:13,573
My wife loved my chili.

863
01:05:13,676 --> 01:05:16,110
Your wife left your gassy old ass.

864
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:18,772
- What's going on?
- Sharp's got a date.

865
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:26,344
- What are you gonna wear?
- Clothes.

866
01:05:26,455 --> 01:05:28,582
- Pants, sport coat.
- Not that butt-ugly thing.

867
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:29,715
I like that sport coat.

868
01:05:29,825 --> 01:05:31,122
I grabbed everything I could find.

869
01:05:31,227 --> 01:05:33,559
What comes first,
astringent or exfoliating lotion?

870
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:34,891
I don't use that stuff.

871
01:05:34,997 --> 01:05:37,022
You've got pores
the size of manhole covers.

872
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:41,229
And the ears, the nose.
We better do something about all this hair.

873
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:43,396
You can use some bronzer.
You need some color.

874
01:05:43,506 --> 01:05:46,270
- I don't bronze.
- You'll bronze, white boy.

875
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:50,141
I have been successfully grooming myself
for longer than y'all have been alive.

876
01:05:50,246 --> 01:05:52,237
Some things have changed
since you were young.

877
01:05:52,348 --> 01:05:54,873
We've discovered fire and the wheel.

878
01:05:54,984 --> 01:05:57,817
She's right. If you wanna get over,
you better listen to us.

879
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,148
I'm just having dinner.

880
01:05:59,255 --> 01:06:02,691
Not looking like that you won't.
Barb, can you do anything with the hair?

881
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,123
Shave it all off.

882
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:05,750
Go talk to her. Give me that.

883
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:13,662
Come on. I mean, it's never gonna work out
between you and Sharp.

884
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:15,964
He's old enough to be your...

885
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:20,341
great-great-great-great grandfather.

886
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:25,106
And you have an opportunity to help him.
You went to beauty school.

887
01:06:25,715 --> 01:06:27,182
I flunked out.

888
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:28,843
I know.

889
01:06:29,752 --> 01:06:31,049
But he doesn't know that.

890
01:06:46,535 --> 01:06:48,730
"Natural-looking dramatic highlights...

891
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:51,807
"that enhance and brighten
your natural hair color."

892
01:06:51,941 --> 01:06:53,169
- Yes.
- No.

893
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:08,451
Okay, let's focus on the conversation.
How are you gonna get things rolling?

894
01:07:08,557 --> 01:07:09,546
I don't know.

895
01:07:09,658 --> 01:07:11,922
It's been a long time
since I went out on a date.

896
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:15,191
That's okay.
Look, just give us a little preview.

897
01:07:16,565 --> 01:07:17,759
I'm her.

898
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:19,264
I come in.

899
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:20,691
Go.

900
01:07:20,803 --> 01:07:23,169
Well, I'll start out by saying "hello."

901
01:07:23,272 --> 01:07:24,864
No, I'll say "hi."

902
01:07:26,142 --> 01:07:28,269
No, "hello" is better. I think.

903
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:30,345
I'll wait and see how I feel at the time.

904
01:07:30,446 --> 01:07:33,006
Then I'll probably start out saying...

905
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:35,741
Asking her if she ever...

906
01:07:40,523 --> 01:07:42,684
We'll start talking about...

907
01:07:45,795 --> 01:07:47,786
I'm in deep shit, ain't I?

908
01:07:52,601 --> 01:07:54,125
Who knew you were such a babe?

909
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:56,067
Even if you didn't let us frost your tips.

910
01:07:56,172 --> 01:07:57,867
You clean up pretty nice, Sergeant.

911
01:07:57,973 --> 01:08:00,567
- You're all that and then some.
- Thank you.

912
01:08:00,676 --> 01:08:03,236
Remember, a woman is like a horse.

913
01:08:03,345 --> 01:08:06,473
She likes the guy on the saddle
to have a tight grip on the reins.

914
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:09,915
Excuse me, a woman is not a horse.
Just be yourself.

915
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:12,952
I'm not so sure being himself
is going in the right direction.

916
01:08:13,055 --> 01:08:16,786
Okay. Just be yourself,
but not the you who you really are.

917
01:08:16,892 --> 01:08:19,725
Be the you who you would be
if you were somebody else.

918
01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:22,627
- Somebody better.
- That's what I mean. Somebody better.

919
01:08:22,731 --> 01:08:24,596
- Maybe we ought to call this off.
- Okay.

920
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:25,667
No!

921
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:29,066
It's too late.
Okay, just don't be the schizoid Sharp.

922
01:08:29,171 --> 01:08:31,435
Be the Sharp who embraces life.

923
01:08:36,645 --> 01:08:39,910
Now, don't worry.
We'll be with you every step of the way.

924
01:08:40,082 --> 01:08:43,779
Sgt. Holt provided us
with a spare set of eyes and ears.

925
01:08:44,687 --> 01:08:46,245
Can you hear me?

926
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:48,418
Can you hear me now?

927
01:08:49,658 --> 01:08:51,626
- Out of here!
- Sorry.

928
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:55,555
Just take these.

929
01:09:00,236 --> 01:09:01,260
Get!

930
01:09:08,177 --> 01:09:09,337
Hello.

931
01:09:09,712 --> 01:09:10,906
Come in.

932
01:09:23,058 --> 01:09:24,992
Tell her she looks nice.

933
01:09:26,896 --> 01:09:28,363
You look nice.

934
01:09:28,597 --> 01:09:31,065
Thank you. So do you.

935
01:09:31,467 --> 01:09:32,900
Nifty jacket.

936
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:36,494
Give her the flowers.

937
01:09:36,605 --> 01:09:38,232
Girls thought you might like those.

938
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:39,830
No, they were your idea.

939
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:43,810
They're my idea,
but the girls thought you might like those.

940
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:46,911
Well, they were right.

941
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:49,747
- They're not here, are they?
- No.

942
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:51,979
Good. That would have been
a little awkward.

943
01:09:52,087 --> 01:09:53,714
<i>Yes. Real awkward.</i>

944
01:09:54,924 --> 01:09:56,391
Take the wine.

945
01:09:56,926 --> 01:09:58,120
<i>Take it.</i>

946
01:09:58,494 --> 01:10:00,359
I'll just go open this.

947
01:10:10,506 --> 01:10:12,098
Where do you keep the corkscrew?

948
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,369
Left of the sink, top drawer.

949
01:10:26,388 --> 01:10:27,480
Look.

950
01:10:27,823 --> 01:10:30,815
Base to Ranger One, we've got
a makeup check in the dining room.

951
01:10:30,926 --> 01:10:34,020
- <i>I repeat, makeup check in the dining room.</i>
- What does that mean?

952
01:10:34,129 --> 01:10:37,098
It means she digs you, man.
Now, loosen the hell up.

953
01:10:46,609 --> 01:10:47,906
Thank you.

954
01:10:49,044 --> 01:10:50,033
Root beer.

955
01:10:50,145 --> 01:10:52,375
I gave up alcohol about 10 years ago.

956
01:10:52,481 --> 01:10:54,711
Didn't like yourself
when you were drinking, huh?

957
01:10:54,817 --> 01:10:58,617
Hell, I loved myself when I drank.
It was other people that had the problem.

958
01:11:00,723 --> 01:11:01,712
He's a dork.

959
01:11:06,795 --> 01:11:09,559
Well, why don't I put these in some water.

960
01:11:11,467 --> 01:11:15,836
All right, look, you got a laugh.
Now go to the table and light the candles.

961
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:18,236
No, that's such a lame move.

962
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:20,069
<i>Candles are a total cliché.</i>

963
01:11:20,175 --> 01:11:22,609
<i>What do you know about clichés?</i>
<i>You've got a waterbed.</i>

964
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:24,941
I say, light the candle. It's sexy.

965
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:29,245
<i>He might as well pull out the bearskin rug</i>
<i>and the disco ball, for God's sake.</i>

966
01:11:29,351 --> 01:11:30,784
I need confirmation.

967
01:11:30,886 --> 01:11:34,083
<i>Is lighting the candle</i>
<i>a cool move or not a cool move?</i>

968
01:11:34,189 --> 01:11:35,247
Fine.

969
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:37,557
All in favor of candles?

970
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:39,628
- Me.
- Opposed?

971
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:44,299
Mission Control to Sharp.
Light those candles.

972
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:53,407
<i>I don't know.</i>

973
01:11:53,676 --> 01:11:58,340
<i>So many of my colleagues just stick it out</i>
<i>for the paycheck and the benefits.</i>

974
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:01,245
Or, in my ex-husband's case...

975
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:04,649
for the endless supply
of fresh, young coeds.

976
01:12:04,953 --> 01:12:08,548
Why would a man want to be with a girl
when he can be with a woman?

977
01:12:09,124 --> 01:12:12,184
Or in your case, with five girls.

978
01:12:13,595 --> 01:12:15,290
What is your story?

979
01:12:16,098 --> 01:12:18,157
My work became my mistress.

980
01:12:19,201 --> 01:12:21,761
Before I knew it, that was all I had.

981
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:43,558
Willie Nelson.

982
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:49,096
Man after my own heart.

983
01:12:51,133 --> 01:12:52,760
You want to dance?

984
01:13:06,315 --> 01:13:08,613
So, what's really going on here?

985
01:13:12,921 --> 01:13:14,115
Dancing.

986
01:13:16,525 --> 01:13:18,516
No, I mean here.

987
01:13:19,862 --> 01:13:22,763
What is a man like you doing in this house?

988
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:26,100
Well, it's...

989
01:13:27,536 --> 01:13:29,401
a temporary assignment.

990
01:13:31,974 --> 01:13:36,308
And I venture to guess it has nothing
to do with cheerleading, does it?

991
01:13:36,512 --> 01:13:37,945
Not much, no.

992
01:13:39,448 --> 01:13:41,416
It's kind of complicated.

993
01:13:46,889 --> 01:13:48,584
You want to go in the living room?

994
01:13:52,194 --> 01:13:53,252
Yeah.

995
01:13:58,033 --> 01:14:00,593
Gross. What are you gonna do,
bag her on the couch?

996
01:14:12,147 --> 01:14:14,775
<i>Good night, Barb. Do your homework.</i>

997
01:14:16,185 --> 01:14:17,914
I can still see you.

998
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:24,318
You're killing me.

999
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:45,105
<i>Hello?</i>

1000
01:14:45,581 --> 01:14:49,039
Hi, I'm returning a call
from somebody named Evie.

1001
01:14:49,284 --> 01:14:51,582
<i>That's me. Is this Emma?</i>

1002
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:54,414
Yeah. I'm sorry, do I know you?

1003
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:56,616
No. But I know your dad.

1004
01:14:57,025 --> 01:14:59,619
I got your number from his cellphone.

1005
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:03,161
I hope you don't mind,
but I'm doing this psych paper...

1006
01:15:03,265 --> 01:15:05,859
and I was wondering
if I could ask you some questions.

1007
01:15:06,535 --> 01:15:08,594
- <i>Yeah, okay.</i>
- <i>Great.</i>

1008
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:10,934
<i>I have this Hex Rally tomorrow night...</i>

1009
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:14,202
<i>but I was wondering</i>
<i>if we can get started tonight.</i>

1010
01:15:26,688 --> 01:15:28,656
Five, six, seven, eight.

1011
01:15:42,271 --> 01:15:44,432
- This is--
- Terrible, I know.

1012
01:15:44,673 --> 01:15:46,436
I was gonna say good.

1013
01:15:46,842 --> 01:15:48,935
I'm proud of you. It's good.

1014
01:15:50,312 --> 01:15:52,644
- What are y'all doing?
- Getting pumped for Hex Rally.

1015
01:15:52,748 --> 01:15:54,545
- We'll have to nix the Hex Rally.
- What?

1016
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:57,778
No. There's no nixing the Hex.
It must go on.

1017
01:15:57,886 --> 01:15:59,945
You can't stop the Hex, Mr. Ranger-man.

1018
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:02,023
- It's bigger than all of us.
- Is that right?

1019
01:16:02,124 --> 01:16:06,959
If we were doctors, we'd cure cancer.
If we were nurses, we'd give people shots.

1020
01:16:07,296 --> 01:16:11,255
If we were astronauts,
we would do other things.

1021
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:15,632
But we're not. We're cheerleaders.
And we're going to the Hex Rally.

1022
01:16:16,138 --> 01:16:18,606
- You don't respect cheerleading, do you?
- No.

1023
01:16:18,707 --> 01:16:20,732
That's because you still don't get it.

1024
01:16:20,842 --> 01:16:23,572
Samuel L. Jackson, Sandra Bullock,
Cameron Diaz...

1025
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:26,045
Calista Flockhart, Madonna and Halle Berry.

1026
01:16:26,148 --> 01:16:30,312
Not to mention Franklin D. Roosevelt,
Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush...

1027
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:33,149
and the governor of our fair state,
Rick Perry.

1028
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:34,381
All cheerleaders.

1029
01:16:34,489 --> 01:16:38,619
See, you're a negative person, Sharp.
Cheerleading is all about the positive.

1030
01:16:38,727 --> 01:16:42,629
Our job is to inspire, support and electrify.

1031
01:16:42,731 --> 01:16:44,562
Any fool can feel good
when you're winning.

1032
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:47,191
But when you're down 27 points
in the fourth quarter...

1033
01:16:47,302 --> 01:16:49,896
that's when you got to ask yourself,
"Who you gonna call?"

1034
01:16:54,843 --> 01:16:56,811
I might call Halle Berry.

1035
01:17:39,187 --> 01:17:43,317
<i>Hey, Longhorns.</i>
<i>Are we ready to take A&M to the mat?</i>

1036
01:17:46,094 --> 01:17:48,688
<i>I don't think these guys can hear you.</i>

1037
01:17:51,099 --> 01:17:54,626
<i>All right, well, now that we've put the hex</i>
<i>on those Aggies...</i>

1038
01:17:54,736 --> 01:17:57,000
<i>I want y'all to raise your flames up high...</i>

1039
01:17:57,105 --> 01:17:59,630
<i>for someone who knows</i>
<i>a thing or two about spirit.</i>

1040
01:17:59,741 --> 01:18:04,144
<i>I am talking about</i>
<i>Assistant Cheer Coach Roland Sharp.</i>

1041
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:09,907
What am I supposed to do with this?

1042
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:12,384
Inspire and electrify. Go!

1043
01:18:14,923 --> 01:18:16,220
<i>All right.</i>

1044
01:18:16,391 --> 01:18:17,619
Bring it.

1045
01:18:19,227 --> 01:18:22,094
<i>This torch right here represents...</i>

1046
01:18:22,497 --> 01:18:24,897
<i>the spirit burning deep within the heart...</i>

1047
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,163
<i>of each and every Longhorn</i>
<i>that never can be extinguished.</i>

1048
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:39,611
<i>All right.</i>

1049
01:18:40,348 --> 01:18:42,748
<i>All right, you're all here because...</i>

1050
01:18:42,851 --> 01:18:45,979
<i>you want to see your Longhorns</i>
<i>emerge victorious.</i>

1051
01:18:46,321 --> 01:18:49,449
<i>You want to see them</i>
<i>dominate the football field...</i>

1052
01:18:49,991 --> 01:18:52,721
<i>and win the football game.</i>

1053
01:18:55,530 --> 01:18:59,091
<i>Well, then it's up to each</i>
<i>and every one of us to help them.</i>

1054
01:18:59,201 --> 01:19:01,135
<i>We got to raise them up.</i>

1055
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:03,496
<i>We got to hoist them high...</i>

1056
01:19:03,972 --> 01:19:06,702
<i>to put them on a platform of positivity.</i>

1057
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:10,271
<i>Any fool can feel good</i>
<i>when you're winning.</i>

1058
01:19:10,378 --> 01:19:13,142
<i>But when you're down 27 points</i>
<i>in the fourth quarter...</i>

1059
01:19:13,248 --> 01:19:16,513
<i>you got to ask yourself,</i>
<i>"Who you gonna call?"</i>

1060
01:19:16,718 --> 01:19:20,745
<i>I tell you who I'm going to call,</i>
<i>and that's these ladies right here.</i>

1061
01:19:20,856 --> 01:19:23,848
<i>They're the most spirited group</i>
<i>of young ladies I've ever seen...</i>

1062
01:19:23,959 --> 01:19:28,157
<i>or had a chance to get to know and</i>
<i>had the privilege of coming in contact with.</i>

1063
01:19:28,263 --> 01:19:30,959
<i>Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition!</i>

1064
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:52,286
Okay, now can I get a witness?
This man has got the spirit.

1065
01:19:52,387 --> 01:19:55,356
Swear to God, I thought
he was gonna start speaking in tongues.

1066
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:57,687
What about "platform of positivity"?

1067
01:19:57,793 --> 01:20:01,559
I was gonna do a cartwheel,
but didn't want to steal the limelight.

1068
01:20:03,698 --> 01:20:05,290
I think Sharp just made a joke.

1069
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:08,028
It's more of a jape or a jest,
but still, it's progress.

1070
01:20:08,136 --> 01:20:10,502
- Can we go to the party?
- <i>Negativo</i>, baby.

1071
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:15,408
Please. When are you guys
gonna get over yourselves?

1072
01:20:15,577 --> 01:20:18,603
Nobody, I repeat, nobody is trying to kill us.

1073
01:20:24,286 --> 01:20:26,550
Get out of this van, right now! Let's go.

1074
01:20:26,788 --> 01:20:27,982
Come on.

1075
01:20:28,390 --> 01:20:30,881
This thing is not working.

1076
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:33,156
- I'm stuck.
- Let's go!

1077
01:20:33,261 --> 01:20:35,320
I'm stuck! I can't get out!

1078
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:38,560
Get down!

1079
01:20:54,449 --> 01:20:57,282
Okay, maybe somebody is trying to kill us.

1080
01:21:00,488 --> 01:21:02,615
How did they, like, find us?

1081
01:21:02,757 --> 01:21:04,452
They looked for us.

1082
01:21:05,293 --> 01:21:07,693
- What about Emma?
- She doesn't know where I am.

1083
01:21:07,796 --> 01:21:11,562
Yes, sir, she does.
She called last night on the house phone.

1084
01:21:13,034 --> 01:21:15,025
She was returning my call.

1085
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:16,965
Was that a mistake?

1086
01:21:20,308 --> 01:21:21,741
Get them upstairs.

1087
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:23,504
Come on, let's go.

1088
01:21:25,046 --> 01:21:26,513
Come on, move.

1089
01:21:33,021 --> 01:21:34,010
Hello?

1090
01:21:34,122 --> 01:21:36,215
- Where you at?
- I'm at home.

1091
01:21:36,324 --> 01:21:37,484
Where's your mother?

1092
01:21:37,626 --> 01:21:40,754
Dad, I told you. She and Keith
went to Cancún for a couple of days.

1093
01:21:40,862 --> 01:21:42,295
<i>You don't have to check up on me.</i>

1094
01:21:42,397 --> 01:21:45,093
Your friend from the FBI is here.
He told me everything.

1095
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:46,895
Let me talk to him.

1096
01:21:48,436 --> 01:21:50,404
He wants to talk to you.

1097
01:21:51,539 --> 01:21:53,598
Hey, Sharp. How are your witnesses doing?

1098
01:21:53,708 --> 01:21:54,732
Everyone safe?

1099
01:21:54,843 --> 01:21:56,708
You're making a big mistake.

1100
01:21:56,811 --> 01:22:00,838
Good. I was just telling Emma that
a desperate guy is trying to cover a crime...

1101
01:22:00,949 --> 01:22:04,214
and if he couldn't get to you,
he might come looking for her.

1102
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:07,447
Don't worry.
I'm here now, and everything's cool.

1103
01:22:09,357 --> 01:22:10,881
Emma doll, is there any more coffee?

1104
01:22:10,992 --> 01:22:13,085
- Sure, Mr. Zane.
- Thank you.

1105
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:20,361
<i>I'm a dead man, Sharp.</i>

1106
01:22:20,468 --> 01:22:22,265
<i>I don't care about your witnesses anymore.</i>

1107
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:25,498
<i>All I want is the money</i>
<i>Ball stole from Cortland.</i>

1108
01:22:26,308 --> 01:22:29,903
<i>All right, the night you arrested Ball,</i>
<i>you took a key from him.</i>

1109
01:22:30,345 --> 01:22:31,369
Yeah.

1110
01:22:31,513 --> 01:22:33,674
Good. Here's what you're gonna do.

1111
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:37,013
<i>You go to the bank,</i>
<i>take the money out of the safe deposit box...</i>

1112
01:22:37,118 --> 01:22:40,349
<i>put the money in a duffle bag,</i>
<i>get in your truck...</i>

1113
01:22:40,689 --> 01:22:44,125
<i>and meet me in Eagle Pass</i>
<i>near the border at 2:00 p.m.</i>

1114
01:22:44,492 --> 01:22:47,393
<i>Only you, Sharp. No one else.</i>

1115
01:23:19,394 --> 01:23:23,353
Put your keys in the bag
and get out of the truck with the money.

1116
01:23:33,541 --> 01:23:35,168
Bag on the ground.

1117
01:23:36,578 --> 01:23:38,671
Put your weapon in the bag.

1118
01:23:41,549 --> 01:23:45,007
Put your cellphone in the bag,
get back in the truck...

1119
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:47,680
and handcuff yourself to the steering wheel.

1120
01:23:47,789 --> 01:23:51,748
Don't try any tricks, Sharp.
I will shoot her right here and now.

1121
01:24:24,059 --> 01:24:26,050
Thanks, Roland. You're a good parent.

1122
01:24:26,161 --> 01:24:27,924
<i>Please board immediately.</i>

1123
01:24:29,864 --> 01:24:31,729
<i>This is the last announcement...</i>

1124
01:24:31,833 --> 01:24:35,929
<i>for the bus leaving</i>
<i>for Laredo, Nuevo Laredo...</i>

1125
01:24:41,943 --> 01:24:43,410
What the hell?

1126
01:24:48,216 --> 01:24:50,707
- What are y'all doing here?
- Barb's got a plan.

1127
01:24:50,819 --> 01:24:52,377
Barb has a plan?

1128
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:55,120
You know what you're doing?

1129
01:24:55,223 --> 01:24:57,817
I spent a year in juvenile detention
for stealing cars.

1130
01:24:57,926 --> 01:25:00,156
It was an educational experience.

1131
01:25:07,435 --> 01:25:09,995
- How'd y'all get here?
- Brand-new car.

1132
01:25:52,247 --> 01:25:54,875
I think I'm having the baby.

1133
01:25:58,553 --> 01:25:59,747
I can't.

1134
01:26:00,188 --> 01:26:03,248
Evie, get it together.
I know you can do it. Just breathe.

1135
01:26:03,391 --> 01:26:05,325
Come on. Breathe. Ready?

1136
01:26:11,432 --> 01:26:14,492
Driver, stop the bus!
My friend's having a baby!

1137
01:26:21,709 --> 01:26:22,903
I did it!

1138
01:26:31,753 --> 01:26:36,213
I have to get off <i>el autobús</i>!
I have to have my baby in America!

1139
01:26:36,925 --> 01:26:38,552
I've got the bags.

1140
01:26:44,499 --> 01:26:47,024
Whoa, that's my bag.

1141
01:26:47,602 --> 01:26:50,162
- No, it's mine.
- It's my bag.

1142
01:26:54,409 --> 01:26:57,537
Hi, Emma. We're friends of your dad's,
so just follow me, okay?

1143
01:26:57,645 --> 01:26:59,579
Look, it's my bag, okay?

1144
01:26:59,814 --> 01:27:01,247
Drop the bag.

1145
01:27:01,416 --> 01:27:02,815
It's my bag!

1146
01:27:03,585 --> 01:27:05,018
Drop the bag.

1147
01:27:16,598 --> 01:27:17,826
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1148
01:27:22,604 --> 01:27:25,095
It's just like dismounting a stretch pyramid.

1149
01:27:25,206 --> 01:27:26,867
Off the bus!

1150
01:27:27,141 --> 01:27:28,438
You ready?

1151
01:27:28,676 --> 01:27:29,904
One, two.

1152
01:27:32,313 --> 01:27:33,803
Move it!

1153
01:27:34,749 --> 01:27:36,910
- Come on, Emma.
- Are you guys serious?

1154
01:27:37,018 --> 01:27:38,212
I'm a math major.

1155
01:27:38,319 --> 01:27:39,513
Move it!

1156
01:27:40,488 --> 01:27:42,547
You, too! Off the bus, now!

1157
01:27:47,729 --> 01:27:49,924
- Come on, you can do it!
- Jump!

1158
01:28:20,395 --> 01:28:21,862
You all right?

1159
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:30,832
I'm fine.

1160
01:30:27,789 --> 01:30:29,154
Halt, <i>señor</i>.

1161
01:30:57,618 --> 01:31:01,918
Eddie, there's doctors, air conditioning
and three meals a day back in town.

1162
01:31:02,023 --> 01:31:03,991
And I need you to testify.

1163
01:31:05,927 --> 01:31:08,395
You're gonna have to kill me, Sharp.

1164
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:20,664
God!

1165
01:31:21,609 --> 01:31:22,667
Damn.

1166
01:31:57,011 --> 01:31:58,774
Looking sharp, Sharp.

1167
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:02,608
I don't know.
Maybe we should do another mask.

1168
01:32:02,917 --> 01:32:05,750
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. I almost forgot.

1169
01:32:09,590 --> 01:32:10,648
Cute.

1170
01:32:10,758 --> 01:32:13,693
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry. Damn it.

1171
01:32:14,462 --> 01:32:17,659
The language! Hello, we're in a church.

1172
01:32:20,434 --> 01:32:21,799
Look at you.

1173
01:32:23,437 --> 01:32:26,531
Hey, you guys.
Could you excuse us for a second?

1174
01:32:27,141 --> 01:32:28,768
- Sure.
- Yeah, okay.

1175
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:30,575
Don't be nervous.

1176
01:32:30,678 --> 01:32:34,444
And Sharp, remember,
inspire and electrify, okay?

1177
01:32:34,715 --> 01:32:36,205
See you. Great.

1178
01:32:41,455 --> 01:32:43,446
I feel like a freak show in this dress.

1179
01:32:43,558 --> 01:32:46,755
Prettiest freak show I ever saw.
Wait till they see you at Vassar.

1180
01:32:46,861 --> 01:32:48,192
Actually...

1181
01:32:48,596 --> 01:32:52,555
I was thinking of turning Vassar down
and becoming a cheerleader.

1182
01:32:55,102 --> 01:32:56,763
Dad, that was a joke.

1183
01:32:57,705 --> 01:33:00,299
A joke. That's why I'm laughing so hard.

1184
01:33:07,448 --> 01:33:09,075
I love you, Daddy.

1185
01:33:13,854 --> 01:33:15,685
I love you, too, baby.

1186
01:33:17,525 --> 01:33:19,117
Dearly beloved...

1187
01:33:19,427 --> 01:33:22,157
we are gathered here for this most...

1188
01:33:22,597 --> 01:33:27,125
splendiferous and loquacious occasion...

1189
01:33:28,769 --> 01:33:31,738
to join this couple in holy matrimony.

1190
01:33:32,473 --> 01:33:34,441
Now, Roland...

1191
01:33:35,376 --> 01:33:39,039
do you promise to love this woman, and...

1192
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:42,872
before you answer, remember that...

1193
01:34:00,868 --> 01:34:02,028
Percy!

1194
01:34:03,838 --> 01:34:05,169
Get on with it.

1195
01:34:05,439 --> 01:34:07,168
Sure, but of course.

1196
01:34:08,109 --> 01:34:09,838
- Well, do you?
- I do.

1197
01:34:10,344 --> 01:34:11,971
And, Molly...

1198
01:34:12,947 --> 01:34:15,438
radiant, beautiful Molly.

1199
01:34:16,450 --> 01:34:19,419
Molly. Good Golly, Miss Molly.

1200
01:34:24,025 --> 01:34:27,461
Do you promise to love Roland...

1201
01:34:28,562 --> 01:34:30,996
when he is odiferous...

1202
01:34:31,732 --> 01:34:33,996
indifferent, belligerent?

1203
01:34:34,301 --> 01:34:35,359
I do.

1204
01:34:36,370 --> 01:34:38,031
- You do?
- I do.

1205
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:40,798
Well.

1206
01:34:41,409 --> 01:34:44,867
By the power vested in me
in the state of Texas...

1207
01:34:45,179 --> 01:34:47,511
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1208
01:34:47,615 --> 01:34:49,549
You may kiss your bride.

1209
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:09,169
Come on, y'all, let's get this party started.

1210
01:35:52,279 --> 01:35:53,712
Who put this table here?
