1
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,208
<i>It was a quiet day at the
Rigby Reardon Detective Agency.</i>

2
00:02:32,344 --> 00:02:37,089
<i>I had a hangover, and business was
so slow I was rereading old newspapers.</i>

3
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:40,723
<i>I was even thinking of closing up
the office for a few days...</i>

4
00:02:40,852 --> 00:02:43,853
<i>...when all of a sudden...</i>

5
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:00,369
- Mr Reardon?
- That's right.

6
00:03:01,206 --> 00:03:03,245
My...

7
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,616
...my name... my...

8
00:03:16,972 --> 00:03:21,432
<i>In all my years in the business,
I'd never seen anything like her.</i>

9
00:03:50,255 --> 00:03:54,169
<i>Was she real? There was
only one way to find out.</i>

10
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:58,294
<i>But I remembered Marlowe's words.</i>

11
00:04:03,518 --> 00:04:05,807
What the hell does Marlowe know?

12
00:04:06,688 --> 00:04:09,642
<i>She was real all right.</i>

13
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:15,691
What are you doing?

14
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:18,313
Adjusting your breasts.

15
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,447
You fainted and they...
shifted all outta whack.

16
00:04:26,374 --> 00:04:28,782
- There.
- Thank you.

17
00:04:29,628 --> 00:04:31,916
You're welcome.

18
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:42,171
Thank you. I... I apologise
for my dramatic entrance.

19
00:04:42,307 --> 00:04:45,925
It's just when I saw
the... newspaper headlines...

20
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:53,769
- You must be quite a Dodgers fan.
<i>- No, I saw... the front page.</i>

21
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,748
- What's your name, Dollface?
- Juliet Forrest.

22
00:05:09,834 --> 00:05:11,874
Forrest...

23
00:05:12,587 --> 00:05:16,252
Daughter of the big cheesemaker.
You could use a cup of my famous java.

24
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:21,003
Cheese was Daddy's hobby.
He was a scientist.

25
00:05:21,972 --> 00:05:25,305
- Quite an accident he had.
- That's what I came to see you about.

26
00:05:25,433 --> 00:05:28,553
You don't think it was an accident.
You think he was murdered.

27
00:05:28,687 --> 00:05:31,094
How did you know?

28
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:34,850
It's my business to know,
Miss Forrest. Sit down.

29
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,772
What makes you think
it wasn't an accident?

30
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:43,577
Just before it... it happened...

31
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:49,536
...he behaved very erratically, writing
out lists of names, dozens of them.

32
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:53,331
He wrote them on blotters
and scratch pads, whatever was handy.

33
00:05:53,461 --> 00:05:56,415
Here's one of the lists... or part of one.

34
00:05:57,465 --> 00:05:59,921
It's from a dollar bill.

35
00:06:02,053 --> 00:06:06,383
Somehow I got the feeling he was
the victim of a giant conspiracy.

36
00:06:09,185 --> 00:06:13,053
You deducted murder
<i>and a giant conspiracy from this?</i>

37
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:16,475
You think I'm too impulsive,
don't you, Mr Reardon?

38
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,851
Maybe.

39
00:06:19,404 --> 00:06:21,646
Maybe not.

40
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:27,576
If you want me to investigate
your father's death, I get $10 a day.

41
00:06:27,704 --> 00:06:30,112
Plus expenses.

42
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:34,452
Will $200 be enough
in advance, Mr Reardon?

43
00:06:34,586 --> 00:06:38,037
- For $200 I'd shoot my grandmother.
- That won't be necessary.

44
00:06:38,173 --> 00:06:43,250
You never can tell. On my last case, I
had to throw my brother out of a plane.

45
00:06:43,386 --> 00:06:46,091
Where'd your father
keep his correspondence?

46
00:06:46,223 --> 00:06:50,137
He had a small private office downtown.
Here's the key.

47
00:06:51,728 --> 00:06:55,393
Thank you, Mr Reardon.
I appreciate this.

48
00:06:56,066 --> 00:06:58,354
- Miss Forrest?
- Yes?

49
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:02,399
Save me some shoe leather if you
told me what address this key fits.

50
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:05,484
It was 429 Firehouse Row.

51
00:07:05,617 --> 00:07:08,286
Pretty seedy part of town
for a renowned scientist.

52
00:07:08,411 --> 00:07:11,329
It was the only place
he could experiment with cheese...

53
00:07:11,456 --> 00:07:14,991
...without the smell
bothering the neighbours.

54
00:07:15,126 --> 00:07:17,582
I'll see what I can turn up.

55
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,219
Good day, Mr Reardon.

56
00:07:25,637 --> 00:07:29,717
<i>On my way to Firehouse Row,
I tried not to think of Juliet Forrest.</i>

57
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,593
<i>I hadn't seen a body like that...</i>

58
00:07:31,726 --> 00:07:35,973
<i>...since I'd solved the case of
the murdered girl with the big tits.</i>

59
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,976
<i>I had no trouble finding
Dr Forrest's cheese lab.</i>

60
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,435
<i>It smelled like the number on the door.</i>

61
00:07:43,321 --> 00:07:45,812
<i>Inside, I turned up
something interesting.</i>

62
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:53,244
"To John Forrest, a dear man who, like
his cheeses, gets stronger with age."

63
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:55,449
"Love, Kitty."

64
00:07:55,584 --> 00:07:59,451
So the old renowned scientist
was getting a little on the side.

65
00:08:12,142 --> 00:08:14,633
"Enemies of Carlotta."

66
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,594
"Friends of Carlotta."

67
00:08:23,111 --> 00:08:25,316
"Kitty Collins"?

68
00:08:32,454 --> 00:08:34,114
Sounds like company.

69
00:08:41,338 --> 00:08:43,793
Exterminator.

70
00:08:45,008 --> 00:08:47,250
Just a minute.

71
00:08:53,642 --> 00:08:55,385
Come in.

72
00:08:59,481 --> 00:09:01,723
Sit down.

73
00:09:07,864 --> 00:09:10,438
There's some cookies on the table.

74
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:14,777
Have one.

75
00:09:19,417 --> 00:09:21,659
Good, aren't they?

76
00:09:29,219 --> 00:09:33,051
Guess to be a really good exterminator
you have to enjoy killing things.

77
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:34,556
Yeah.

78
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:40,203
- Yes?
- I'd like to see Miss Forrest.

79
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:44,871
- Who shall I say is calling?
- Mr Reardon. Tell her I've been shot.

80
00:10:45,003 --> 00:10:46,663
Very good, sir.

81
00:10:46,796 --> 00:10:50,165
- May I tell her by whom?
- No. I don't know myself.

82
00:10:51,843 --> 00:10:55,923
Are you all right? You look
as though you're going to faint.

83
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:58,511
Faint? Ha!

84
00:10:59,351 --> 00:11:01,390
Never.

85
00:11:02,646 --> 00:11:04,971
- Catch me.
- Sorry.

86
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,109
I'm a butler... not a catcher.

87
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:20,114
Dollface...

88
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:26,034
What are you doing?!

89
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,881
It should feel better now.

90
00:11:38,557 --> 00:11:41,474
<i>- Where'd you learn that?</i>
- At camp.

91
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:47,562
- You learned that at girls' camp?
- It's really for snakebite, but...

92
00:11:47,691 --> 00:11:49,814
...I find it works for everything.

93
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:55,151
You mumbled about Kitty Collins
and Swede Anderson being on a list.

94
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:58,982
- "Friends of Carlotta"?
- That's right. Do you know them?

95
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,785
Kitty was...

96
00:12:04,249 --> 00:12:08,578
...Kitty was someone Daddy
trifled with after Mother dried up.

97
00:12:08,712 --> 00:12:11,167
And Swede was Kitty's boyfriend.

98
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:14,581
Where are they now?

99
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:18,043
The last I heard,
they were in Santa Barbara.

100
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:21,513
He used to be a boxer.
Now he works in a gas station...

101
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:23,764
...and she sings in a private club.

102
00:12:27,898 --> 00:12:32,026
You may be interested in this.
I found it in Daddy's study.

103
00:12:33,862 --> 00:12:36,732
"Thanks for the check.
In case I'm indisposed...

104
00:12:36,865 --> 00:12:40,909
...the dollar you gave me for safekeeping
is in the top of the sugar bowl."

105
00:12:41,036 --> 00:12:43,194
- "Shh."
- Why?

106
00:12:43,914 --> 00:12:46,037
No. This.

107
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:51,245
No, no, no. That's not "Shh."
It's S-H-H. Samuel H Hastings.

108
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:53,787
My brother-in-law. Or at least he was.

109
00:12:53,924 --> 00:12:57,791
He and my sister Leona are separated.
He's a hopeless drunk.

110
00:12:57,928 --> 00:13:00,300
- Where is he now?
- I don't know.

111
00:13:01,723 --> 00:13:04,392
Get your sister Leona for me.

112
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,142
All right.

113
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:09,021
I'm afraid she may
not be very much help.

114
00:13:09,147 --> 00:13:12,397
- She's very disturbed.
- How disturbed?

115
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:15,396
She's been diagnosed
as a paranoid hypochondriac.

116
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:19,147
- Doctors think she may be faking.
- I'll know after one word if she is.

117
00:13:22,661 --> 00:13:24,404
- Hello?
- She's faking.

118
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:28,701
Mrs Hastings? My name's Reardon.
Sorry to hear your father's passed on.

119
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,538
No, he hasn't.
He won't be back till Sunday.

120
00:13:31,795 --> 00:13:34,500
Sunday? You don't understand,
Mrs Hastings.

121
00:13:34,631 --> 00:13:37,169
I'm investigating your father's death.

122
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:41,345
My father called me from Chicago
tonight. He never mentioned a word!

123
00:13:41,471 --> 00:13:44,140
Maybe it slipped his mind.

124
00:13:44,266 --> 00:13:47,469
Look, uh, your father
<i>is dead, Mrs Hastings.</i>

125
00:13:47,602 --> 00:13:50,769
Your sister Juliet feels
his death wasn't an accident.

126
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:53,019
What are you talking about?

127
00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:55,901
<i>I had a long talk with him
just a little while ago.</i>

128
00:13:56,027 --> 00:14:00,903
<i>- He told me terrible things about you.</i>
- Listen, you phony fruitcake!

129
00:14:02,826 --> 00:14:06,610
Sorry I called you a fruitcake.
I just don't have time to listen to...

130
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:09,202
All right, don't listen! Who cares?

131
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:13,453
Your sister has a lot to learn
about phone courtesy.

132
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:15,745
You got any idea
how I could locate Sam?

133
00:14:15,881 --> 00:14:18,751
You might ask the bartenders
along 5th Street.

134
00:14:18,884 --> 00:14:21,339
I'll call you if I turn up anything.

135
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:27,637
Oh... If I'm not home, leave a message
with the butler or the cleaning woman.

136
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:34,060
Cleaning woman.

137
00:14:35,692 --> 00:14:38,100
Cleaning woman.

138
00:14:38,736 --> 00:14:40,979
Cleaning woman.

139
00:14:41,865 --> 00:14:45,316
Cleaning woman! Cleaning woman!

140
00:14:45,577 --> 00:14:47,984
Cleaning woman! Cleaning woman!

141
00:14:48,246 --> 00:14:50,453
Cleaning woman! Cleaning woman!

142
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,133
Sorry.

143
00:15:11,686 --> 00:15:14,094
Why did you do that?

144
00:15:18,568 --> 00:15:21,190
When I was seven years old...

145
00:15:21,862 --> 00:15:24,532
...my father ran off with the cleaning...

146
00:15:29,246 --> 00:15:31,238
My mother died of a broken heart.

147
00:15:32,374 --> 00:15:35,244
Now every time
someone says cleaning...

148
00:15:42,467 --> 00:15:45,801
...I go berserk.
- Oh! You poor dear.

149
00:15:46,805 --> 00:15:49,343
I don't blame you for strangling me.

150
00:15:50,308 --> 00:15:52,799
I'll never say it again.

151
00:15:53,895 --> 00:15:55,935
Thanks.

152
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:00,433
So long, Dollface.

153
00:16:10,161 --> 00:16:13,495
<i>I legged it down 5th Street
looking for Samuel H Hastings.</i>

154
00:16:13,623 --> 00:16:16,541
<i>It was a street of frustrated hopes
and broken dreams.</i>

155
00:16:16,668 --> 00:16:21,959
<i>Everything was cheap, cut-rate.
Even the prostitutes were having a sale.</i>

156
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:27,085
<i>There was no problem finding Hastings.
He owed money to every bartender.</i>

157
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:31,681
<i>He was staying at the Hotel Ward on
5th Street. It used to be on 8th Street...</i>

158
00:16:31,808 --> 00:16:36,387
<i>...but they took so many rubber cheques,
it bounced all the way across town.</i>

159
00:16:36,521 --> 00:16:38,977
<i>I went to his room and knocked.</i>

160
00:16:51,161 --> 00:16:54,446
- Hastings? Sam Hastings?
- Who is it?

161
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:58,031
My name is Reardon.
I... have a proposition for ya.

162
00:16:59,211 --> 00:17:01,452
But not today. Does it have to be today?

163
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:04,126
- Yeah.
- Come on Monday.

164
00:17:05,175 --> 00:17:09,219
- I got that money for ya.
- What money?

165
00:17:09,346 --> 00:17:12,300
There's a dollar bill
hidden in your sugar bowl.

166
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:14,888
I'll give you five bucks for it.

167
00:17:15,644 --> 00:17:19,143
- You could buy a lotta booze with that.
- Just a minute.

168
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:26,144
Look in the top.

169
00:17:40,043 --> 00:17:44,255
It fits perfectly.
Most of the names are illegible...

170
00:17:44,381 --> 00:17:47,915
...but I can work out
Kitty Collins and Swede Anderson.

171
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:51,049
But what does "FOC" mean?

172
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:56,221
It's a slang word. When a man and a
woman are in love, the man puts his...

173
00:17:56,351 --> 00:17:58,807
No, no. Written here. F-O-C.

174
00:17:59,396 --> 00:18:03,524
Oh. Unless I miss my guess,
that stands for "Friends of Carlotta".

175
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:08,437
- I'm impressed.
<i>- You think that's impressive...</i>

176
00:18:13,785 --> 00:18:17,119
<i>There I was, standing like a kid
doing corny tricks for her...</i>

177
00:18:17,247 --> 00:18:20,532
<i>...driving miles out of my way
just to see her.</i>

178
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,790
<i>Why?</i>

179
00:18:23,587 --> 00:18:26,042
What are you thinking, Mr Reardon?

180
00:18:27,716 --> 00:18:31,049
So long, Dollface. I'll be
in Santa Barbara if you need me.

181
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:43,017
<i>I found out Kitty Collins
was working at the Brentwood Room.</i>

182
00:18:43,148 --> 00:18:44,808
<i>The Brentwood Room.</i>

183
00:18:44,941 --> 00:18:49,069
<i>Where rich women go to meet rich men
so they can have rich kids.</i>

184
00:18:58,788 --> 00:19:00,781
Miss Collins?

185
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:04,995
<i>Kitty wouldn't give me any information
if she thought I was a private eye...</i>

186
00:19:05,128 --> 00:19:06,587
Excuse me.

187
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:10,082
<i>...so I decided to act like
a big-shot movie producer.</i>

188
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:14,419
- My name's Reardon. I make movies.
- How wonderful of you.

189
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:18,553
- You like boxing pictures?
- I'm afraid I've never seen one.

190
00:19:18,683 --> 00:19:24,389
I'm casting a big boxing picture at RKO.
I'm looking for a singer. You interested?

191
00:19:24,522 --> 00:19:28,567
The idea of two men beating
each other to a pulp makes me ill.

192
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:32,143
Well, I'm also doing a religious picture.

193
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,483
The Story of Saint... Betty.

194
00:19:37,118 --> 00:19:41,578
You know, the... nun who
taught the lepers how to sing.

195
00:19:42,457 --> 00:19:44,829
- How wonderful of you.
- Thanks.

196
00:19:46,628 --> 00:19:49,878
John Hay Forrest said
you were a friend of Carlotta's.

197
00:19:50,006 --> 00:19:51,999
Will you excuse me?

198
00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:55,549
<i>I must have hit a nerve.
She went white as a ghost.</i>

199
00:19:56,011 --> 00:19:59,962
<i>The next day I tailed Kitty Collins
to a fancy restaurant.</i>

200
00:20:03,228 --> 00:20:07,308
<i>Midway through the meal, she noticed
me and did a pretty strange thing.</i>

201
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:09,930
<i>She took off her brooch and ditched it.</i>

202
00:20:10,694 --> 00:20:13,363
<i>I had a pretty good idea where.</i>

203
00:20:28,211 --> 00:20:30,998
Hold it, pal. I'm from
the health department.

204
00:20:31,131 --> 00:20:35,342
We have a report that your soup
has too much jewellery in it.

205
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:59,407
"EOC." Enemies of Carlotta.

206
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:05,570
<i>The only name on the list that
wasn't crossed out was Swede Anderson.</i>

207
00:21:05,707 --> 00:21:09,539
<i>I decided to drop in on him
before they crossed him out too.</i>

208
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:11,828
<i>Swede wasn't living in luxury.</i>

209
00:21:11,963 --> 00:21:15,794
<i>As a matter of fact, for a moment,
I thought he wasn't living at all.</i>

210
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:20,171
Swede?

211
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:25,224
Sorry, Swede. I thought
you'd been murdered.

212
00:21:26,561 --> 00:21:28,803
Come on, wake up!

213
00:21:30,315 --> 00:21:31,726
Come on, Swede.

214
00:21:34,109 --> 00:21:36,732
You need a cup of my java.

215
00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:02,480
You're up. Good. The java
will be ready in a minute.

216
00:23:20,717 --> 00:23:23,504
This is never gonna heal.

217
00:23:34,772 --> 00:23:39,518
Anyway, my guess is by now Kitty
Collins is a million miles from here.

218
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:44,320
Do you think Swede was killed by
the same man who murdered my father?

219
00:23:44,449 --> 00:23:48,992
Hold it, Dollface. No one's proved
your father's been murdered...

220
00:23:50,872 --> 00:23:52,745
...yet.

221
00:23:52,874 --> 00:23:56,290
But you may be right about
this being a conspiracy.

222
00:23:56,419 --> 00:24:00,287
It's big. Maybe too big
for me to handle alone.

223
00:24:00,966 --> 00:24:03,089
Get me a cup of java, will ya?

224
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,388
- Yeah?
<i>- Hello, Marlowe?</i>

225
00:24:09,516 --> 00:24:11,805
- Oh, hello, Bernie.
- No, it's me, Rigby.

226
00:24:11,935 --> 00:24:12,931
<i>What's up?</i>

227
00:24:13,061 --> 00:24:16,596
I'm on an important case. I need
your help. How soon can you get here?

228
00:24:16,731 --> 00:24:20,895
- I haven't had breakfast.
- Breakfast? You're late for lunch, pal.

229
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:23,353
<i>- It's two o'clock.</i>
- Two o'clock?

230
00:24:23,488 --> 00:24:26,442
Hustle on over here.
I'll make you a cup of my famous java.

231
00:24:26,575 --> 00:24:30,193
- I'd rather buy my own.
- Suit yourself. See ya in a half-hour.

232
00:24:30,328 --> 00:24:33,282
And Marlowe. Wear a tie, for God's sake.

233
00:24:37,127 --> 00:24:39,250
What's that?

234
00:24:39,379 --> 00:24:41,418
I found it in Daddy's desk.

235
00:24:43,466 --> 00:24:47,546
It looks like a key to one of
those lockers at the train station.

236
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,511
Number's been filed off.
What's it say on that envelope?

237
00:24:52,475 --> 00:24:54,717
"Most recent rat."

238
00:24:56,313 --> 00:24:59,479
- Very clever.
- You understand what it means?

239
00:24:59,608 --> 00:25:03,392
Just a hunch. You know the Chinese
have a different animal for every year?

240
00:25:03,528 --> 00:25:06,648
- Yes.
- Unless I miss my guess...

241
00:25:06,781 --> 00:25:09,866
...the most recent
Year of the Rat was 1936.

242
00:25:10,702 --> 00:25:13,656
This is the key to locker number 1936.

243
00:25:14,915 --> 00:25:17,869
- You're a very smart man.
- So was Abraham Lincoln.

244
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,500
Look what happened to him.
Smart can get you killed.

245
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:27,292
I hope not.

246
00:25:28,595 --> 00:25:31,050
Sometimes I feel I would like to...

247
00:25:34,184 --> 00:25:36,675
<i>You'd like to what? Kiss me?</i>

248
00:25:37,354 --> 00:25:39,227
<i>Yeah, that would be nice.</i>

249
00:25:39,356 --> 00:25:43,603
<i>It would give me a chance to tell her
I was starting to feel something for her.</i>

250
00:25:43,735 --> 00:25:46,024
<i>Something warm and squishy.</i>

251
00:25:46,488 --> 00:25:51,648
<i>But a man in my business can't
take on a wife, have a bunch of kids.</i>

252
00:25:53,328 --> 00:25:56,448
- We wouldn't have to have kids.
- What?

253
00:25:59,793 --> 00:26:02,035
Look, this is getting us nowhere.

254
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:03,795
But thanks anyway.

255
00:26:03,922 --> 00:26:07,836
You'd better go now. Marlowe's
coming over here to talk.

256
00:26:11,972 --> 00:26:14,260
If you need me, just call.

257
00:26:17,894 --> 00:26:20,266
You know how to dial, don't you?

258
00:26:20,397 --> 00:26:25,058
You just put your finger in the hole,
and make tiny little circles.

259
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:41,955
Come on in. It's open.

260
00:26:46,255 --> 00:26:48,498
Hello, Marlowe.

261
00:26:48,633 --> 00:26:51,551
Dammit. You didn't do what I told ya.

262
00:26:52,095 --> 00:26:55,630
I hate that dumb way of wearing
your shirt buttoned with no tie.

263
00:26:55,765 --> 00:26:58,256
Let me get you a tie.

264
00:26:58,852 --> 00:27:02,684
Here. This one's blue,
but you can wear it with brown.

265
00:27:02,813 --> 00:27:05,483
- You annoy me.
- I annoy you?

266
00:27:05,609 --> 00:27:09,024
You come in here with no tie...
Are you drunk?

267
00:27:09,154 --> 00:27:11,941
- How many have you had?
- One martini.

268
00:27:12,073 --> 00:27:14,695
- I knew I was gonna see you.
- Sit down.

269
00:27:20,207 --> 00:27:22,780
Here's what I want you to do.

270
00:27:26,546 --> 00:27:30,129
Here's a list of names I found in a
bowl of soup. Don't ask me to explain.

271
00:27:30,258 --> 00:27:32,928
I think they're all dead.
I want you to check 'em out.

272
00:27:33,053 --> 00:27:36,552
And Marlowe? Put this on
for me, huh? As a favour.

273
00:27:36,681 --> 00:27:38,923
It's a clip-on.

274
00:27:42,395 --> 00:27:46,892
<i>I put Marlowe to work checking Kitty's
list against recent unsolved murders...</i>

275
00:27:47,025 --> 00:27:49,314
<i>...while I yellow-cabbed it
to the station...</i>

276
00:27:49,444 --> 00:27:53,276
<i>...to see how Dr Forrest's key
would fit into the puzzle.</i>

277
00:27:53,406 --> 00:27:56,740
<i>I sashayed over to locker number 1936.</i>

278
00:27:58,203 --> 00:28:02,034
<i>The key fit like a glove.
As I opened the locker...</i>

279
00:28:02,165 --> 00:28:05,747
<i>...I noticed a handsome guy
in a grey pinstripe watching me.</i>

280
00:28:05,877 --> 00:28:10,041
<i>It seemed I wasn't the only one who was
interested in the contents of that locker.</i>

281
00:28:10,465 --> 00:28:13,999
<i>Inside were two long lists of
Carlotta's friends and enemies.</i>

282
00:28:14,135 --> 00:28:16,805
<i>The first name that jumped out
was FX Huberman...</i>

283
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:20,179
<i>...number 46 Bay Court Drive,
Grunion Point.</i>

284
00:28:21,268 --> 00:28:25,348
<i>I decided to take a little train ride
and visit Mr Huberman.</i>

285
00:28:26,022 --> 00:28:29,107
<i>I knew "Handsome" would follow me,
so to throw him off...</i>

286
00:28:29,234 --> 00:28:32,934
<i>...I cleverly ducked into
the men's room and lost him.</i>

287
00:28:33,822 --> 00:28:38,282
<i>There was no way he could follow me
unless I had toilet paper on my shoe.</i>

288
00:28:41,037 --> 00:28:43,077
Damn!

289
00:28:48,211 --> 00:28:51,082
<i>It wasn't really toilet paper,
it was a seat cover...</i>

290
00:28:51,214 --> 00:28:54,915
<i>...but it was enough for
a smart guy to make the connection.</i>

291
00:28:55,927 --> 00:28:57,883
<i>As soon as we went into a tunnel...</i>

292
00:28:58,013 --> 00:29:02,758
<i>...Handsome popped in and started
looking for a match... in my pockets.</i>

293
00:29:03,892 --> 00:29:07,512
Oh! Was that your leg?
- No, it was my face.

294
00:29:07,647 --> 00:29:09,854
I had no idea we were
going into a tunnel.

295
00:29:09,983 --> 00:29:12,225
I'm sure.

296
00:29:12,903 --> 00:29:14,942
I thought the compartment was empty.

297
00:29:15,071 --> 00:29:17,194
Yeah, right. Uh-huh, sure.

298
00:29:18,658 --> 00:29:22,573
- I'm so sorry. I hope I didn't hurt you.
- It's all right.

299
00:29:25,582 --> 00:29:28,073
To what do I owe
the pleasure of your company?

300
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:31,543
The man in the next compartment's
smoking a vile cigar.

301
00:29:31,671 --> 00:29:34,956
I had to come in here.
You don't smoke, do you?

302
00:29:35,091 --> 00:29:38,258
- No, I have tuberculosis.
- Oh, thank heavens for that.

303
00:29:38,386 --> 00:29:41,471
After last night,
my head couldn't stand it.

304
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:50,519
<i>I didn't want him to know where I was
going so I decided to put him away fast.</i>

305
00:29:52,275 --> 00:29:54,398
<i>I always carry my harmonica.</i>

306
00:29:54,527 --> 00:29:58,442
<i>It's lighter than an accordion,
and more powerful than a sleeping pill.</i>

307
00:30:05,247 --> 00:30:09,327
<i>I left him napping like a baby
when I ducked out at Grunion Point.</i>

308
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:18,674
Here's three bucks if you can get
this cab to 46 Bay Court in ten minutes.

309
00:30:22,973 --> 00:30:25,428
Follow that cab!

310
00:30:27,769 --> 00:30:29,845
<i>It was a pretty clever thing I did.</i>

311
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:34,725
<i>By taking the only two cabs, I made
sure Handsome couldn't follow me.</i>

312
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,862
<i>When I arrived at Mr Huberman's,
I was surprised.</i>

313
00:30:39,989 --> 00:30:44,236
<i>Mr Huberman turned out to be
a sexy dame who was throwing a party.</i>

314
00:30:44,369 --> 00:30:48,663
<i>She didn't even ask me what I wanted,
just made me feel real welcome.</i>

315
00:30:53,253 --> 00:30:57,084
How about you, handsome?
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?

316
00:30:57,215 --> 00:30:59,753
Maybe. I've been somewhere before.

317
00:31:00,302 --> 00:31:04,086
It's nice of you to invite me.
I feel a little like a party crasher.

318
00:31:04,222 --> 00:31:06,630
I like party crashers.

319
00:31:06,766 --> 00:31:09,388
I like classy dames with bedroom eyes.

320
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,559
You know something? I like you.

321
00:31:11,687 --> 00:31:13,562
I like me too.

322
00:31:13,689 --> 00:31:18,232
When these people leave, maybe...
you and I can have a party of our own.

323
00:31:18,361 --> 00:31:20,769
Oh, I... I have to think that over.

324
00:31:22,406 --> 00:31:23,687
<i>She was a fast thinker.</i>

325
00:31:24,284 --> 00:31:28,745
I'm very sorry. You all have to go.
It has been a perfectly hideous party.

326
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:32,532
- Good night.
- Good night.

327
00:31:54,189 --> 00:31:56,643
Stuffy in here, isn't it?

328
00:31:58,568 --> 00:32:01,651
<i>Suddenly I realised
she'd slipped me a Mickey.</i>

329
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:06,442
<i>My lips felt like two manhole covers.
My tongue felt like it had hair on it.</i>

330
00:32:06,576 --> 00:32:10,074
<i>My ears started to ring. I felt like a dog.</i>

331
00:32:12,749 --> 00:32:14,457
Woof!

332
00:32:14,584 --> 00:32:16,577
Woof, Huberman, woof!

333
00:32:16,711 --> 00:32:19,380
Come on. Let's go out dancin'.

334
00:32:20,381 --> 00:32:23,916
You put on your black dress,
and I'll go shave my tongue.

335
00:32:33,186 --> 00:32:35,808
# Barbasol, Barbasol

336
00:32:36,273 --> 00:32:38,312
# No brush, no lather, no rub-in

337
00:32:38,441 --> 00:32:40,149
# Wet your razor then begin

338
00:32:40,277 --> 00:32:43,692
# Barbasol, Barbasol

339
00:32:43,822 --> 00:32:46,360
# 0ompah, oompah, oompah, oompah

340
00:33:16,104 --> 00:33:17,729
Come on, FX. I'm ready!

341
00:33:19,232 --> 00:33:21,474
Let's go dancing.

342
00:33:34,956 --> 00:33:36,071
Hold it!

343
00:33:36,791 --> 00:33:39,247
Sorry, Dollface.

344
00:33:39,544 --> 00:33:43,245
<i>- How did you get here?</i>
- Your door was open, so I walked in.

345
00:33:44,174 --> 00:33:47,922
- I've been trying to call you all night.
- How did I get here?

346
00:33:48,052 --> 00:33:51,469
- I guess you must have crawled.
- Oh, God!

347
00:33:52,724 --> 00:33:55,262
- Oh, no, that's OK.
- It's just a little alcohol.

348
00:33:55,393 --> 00:33:57,351
- They don't hurt.
- Don't be a baby.

349
00:33:57,478 --> 00:33:59,886
Get back!

350
00:34:03,693 --> 00:34:06,065
What's up?

351
00:34:07,364 --> 00:34:09,984
Sam Hastings is dead.

352
00:34:10,116 --> 00:34:12,607
Poor rummy. How did he get it?

353
00:34:12,743 --> 00:34:16,112
Fell out of a window
reaching for a bottle of whisky.

354
00:34:16,248 --> 00:34:20,410
He could have been pushed. I'll have
Marlowe check his back for fingerprints.

355
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:23,081
- Anything else?
- Yes.

356
00:34:23,213 --> 00:34:26,248
I found another note
Daddy wrote to himself.

357
00:34:26,383 --> 00:34:28,210
"NYTAG-216."

358
00:34:28,343 --> 00:34:31,214
I think it's a New York
licence plate number.

359
00:34:31,346 --> 00:34:34,715
Not bad, Dollface.
Unless I'm... Ohh! Agh!

360
00:34:34,849 --> 00:34:37,090
Careful. Let me get you some alcohol.

361
00:34:37,227 --> 00:34:39,266
No!

362
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:48,481
It's not N-Y TAG. It's N-Y-T.

363
00:34:49,446 --> 00:34:51,689
<i>New York Times.</i>

364
00:34:57,414 --> 00:34:59,371
So what's "A-G"?

365
00:34:59,499 --> 00:35:03,413
- Standard library talk for August.
- And 216?

366
00:35:03,837 --> 00:35:07,537
Stands for the August 2nd issue,
page one, column six.

367
00:35:08,758 --> 00:35:11,000
Extension 20, please.

368
00:35:11,469 --> 00:35:13,628
Hi. It's me, Rigby.

369
00:35:13,763 --> 00:35:15,721
Sorry, Hot Legs, I've been busy.

370
00:35:15,849 --> 00:35:18,304
You sashay over to
<i>your New York Times file...</i>

371
00:35:18,434 --> 00:35:22,514
...read me what's on page one,
column six of the August 2nd issue...

372
00:35:22,647 --> 00:35:25,221
...maybe I'll wine and dine you
some night soon.

373
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:26,390
I'll wait.

374
00:35:26,526 --> 00:35:28,934
You'd wine and dine her for information?

375
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:31,443
Her? Him.

376
00:35:31,572 --> 00:35:34,242
Yeah... Then read me the whole article.

377
00:35:37,871 --> 00:35:40,113
<i>"Immer Essen".</i>

378
00:35:40,957 --> 00:35:43,329
Walter Neff's the owner.

379
00:35:44,336 --> 00:35:46,791
Thanks, Hot Legs. I owe you a big one.

380
00:35:47,421 --> 00:35:49,664
<i>Immer essen.</i>

381
00:35:52,594 --> 00:35:55,167
<i>Immer essen.</i>
That means "always eating".

382
00:35:55,388 --> 00:35:57,796
- What language?
- German.

383
00:35:58,475 --> 00:36:01,310
It's also the name of
a South American cruise ship.

384
00:36:01,436 --> 00:36:06,394
I know! When Sam Hastings
and my sister separated last July...

385
00:36:07,274 --> 00:36:09,683
...he took a South American tour
on that ship.

386
00:36:09,819 --> 00:36:11,941
Very interesting.

387
00:36:12,072 --> 00:36:15,571
Right after that tour,
the company cancelled its cruises.

388
00:36:15,699 --> 00:36:18,370
Now Sam Hastings is dead.

389
00:36:18,495 --> 00:36:23,038
- I don't see the connection.
- I don't either. That's what bothers me.

390
00:36:35,845 --> 00:36:38,087
Hello?

391
00:36:39,641 --> 00:36:41,514
- Who is it?
- This is Marlowe.

392
00:36:41,935 --> 00:36:45,553
Oh, hello, Mr Marlowe.
Would you hold a moment, please?

393
00:36:46,439 --> 00:36:48,895
- It's Marlowe.
- Good.

394
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:06,324
Hello, Marlowe. Listen, don't check out
those unsolved murders right now.

395
00:37:06,459 --> 00:37:07,539
Yeah? Why not?

396
00:37:07,668 --> 00:37:12,580
I got something more important. You
ever had any dealings with Walter Neff?

397
00:37:12,716 --> 00:37:16,049
Walter Neff. He runs
a South American cruise-ship company.

398
00:37:17,094 --> 00:37:18,886
Good. Tell me about him.

399
00:37:19,055 --> 00:37:22,140
Cruises supermarkets
looking for blondes?

400
00:37:23,517 --> 00:37:26,436
Good. I'll supply the blonde.

401
00:37:31,693 --> 00:37:33,021
One other thing.

402
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:37,062
If Walter Neff leaves the country,
I may have to take a little boat ride.

403
00:37:37,198 --> 00:37:42,193
If I do, stay off the booze. These
people we're dealing with are killers.

404
00:37:42,329 --> 00:37:45,910
<i>Well, thanks for telling me.</i>
Have a nice trip.

405
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:49,492
I may not leave right away,
but thanks anyway. And Marlowe?

406
00:37:49,628 --> 00:37:51,953
<i>- You wearin' a tie?</i>
- Goodbye.

407
00:37:56,092 --> 00:37:58,630
<i>- What was that all about?</i>
- Marlowe knows Neff.

408
00:37:58,762 --> 00:38:01,632
Says he's a pushover
for beautiful blondes.

409
00:38:01,765 --> 00:38:04,137
It means we need a female spy.

410
00:38:09,314 --> 00:38:11,307
Why not use me?

411
00:38:16,154 --> 00:38:18,277
Sorry.

412
00:38:18,406 --> 00:38:20,779
You're not blonde enough.

413
00:38:33,588 --> 00:38:37,253
- I can always dye my hair.
- No dice, Dollface. You're a client.

414
00:38:37,384 --> 00:38:42,461
That's one thing I've learned about
clients. Dead ones don't pay their bills.

415
00:38:46,601 --> 00:38:48,890
Is that all you think of me?

416
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,392
Someone who pays you $10 a day?

417
00:38:57,737 --> 00:39:01,189
That's right, Dollface.
To me you're just a meal ticket.

418
00:39:03,617 --> 00:39:05,907
<i>How could I tell her that I was lying?</i>

419
00:39:06,036 --> 00:39:10,035
<i>I'd work for nothing just to watch
her hair bounce as she walked...</i>

420
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:13,915
<i>...smell her creamy skin,
cradle her head on my shoulder.</i>

421
00:39:14,588 --> 00:39:18,039
<i>Feel the slope of her waist,
the curve of her back...</i>

422
00:39:18,173 --> 00:39:21,259
<i>...and then gently caress
her two beautiful...</i>

423
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:29,299
I'm sorry.

424
00:39:29,436 --> 00:39:32,556
I just don't like
being called a meal ticket.

425
00:39:47,829 --> 00:39:52,206
<i>As I started my search for a blonde spy,
I tried to get rid of the image of Juliet...</i>

426
00:39:52,334 --> 00:39:56,247
<i>...storming out of my office
with toothpaste on her shoes.</i>

427
00:39:57,964 --> 00:40:02,128
<i>First on my list was Monica Stillpond,
a bombshell who once told me...</i>

428
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:06,803
<i>...she would do anything
for anybody anywhere at any time.</i>

429
00:40:09,016 --> 00:40:11,638
<i>But muscle gave me
my start in politics.</i>

430
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:15,103
It was when I was assistant
to old man Zimmerman, the plumber.

431
00:40:15,232 --> 00:40:19,063
- Mr Madvig, you're joking.
- About the plumbing, or the muscle?

432
00:40:19,194 --> 00:40:21,732
I just can't imagine you as a plumber.

433
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:24,564
<i>She was in the middle
of a fancy dinner party.</i>

434
00:40:24,699 --> 00:40:28,744
<i>But I couldn't waste time being polite.
I caught her attention.</i>

435
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,741
Coffee will be served
in the living room, Mr Madvig.

436
00:40:36,962 --> 00:40:42,169
<i>One thing about Monica: The words
"I can't" weren't in her vocabulary.</i>

437
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,791
Monica, I want you
to do something for me.

438
00:40:44,928 --> 00:40:47,004
I can't.

439
00:40:47,137 --> 00:40:50,921
<i>I guess she had added them
since the last time I'd seen her.</i>

440
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:55,928
<i>The next one on my list was
Doris Devermont, an old flame of mine.</i>

441
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:59,729
<i>With her I'd had the most honest
relationship I'd ever had with a woman.</i>

442
00:40:59,859 --> 00:41:04,438
<i>The only thing I'd lied about was my
name. I'd told her I was Teddy Novak...</i>

443
00:41:04,573 --> 00:41:08,072
<i>...so she couldn't track me down
if I got her pregnant.</i>

444
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:17,456
<i>Doris remembered me, naturally.</i>

445
00:41:17,586 --> 00:41:19,543
How do you do, Mr Novak?

446
00:41:19,671 --> 00:41:24,914
Mr Novak? No hugs, no kisses? We used
to flop into each other's arms, Doris.

447
00:41:25,051 --> 00:41:29,095
Well, don't you think we really ought to
get to know each other all over again?

448
00:41:29,222 --> 00:41:33,801
It's only been five years. You were about
to serve me dinner when I had to leave.

449
00:41:33,935 --> 00:41:36,307
How stupid of me.
You must be famished.

450
00:41:36,438 --> 00:41:40,435
I should have thought of it sooner.
I'll get some coffee and sandwiches.

451
00:41:41,735 --> 00:41:44,142
<i>Coffee and sandwiches.</i>

452
00:41:44,279 --> 00:41:47,446
<i>Now I remembered Doris's
famous stale-bread sandwiches.</i>

453
00:41:48,325 --> 00:41:53,283
<i>She'd buy day-old bread, then toast it
to cover up. I wonder if she's changed.</i>

454
00:41:53,413 --> 00:41:56,284
The bread's none too fresh.
Shall I toast it?

455
00:41:57,125 --> 00:42:00,079
No, thanks.
I gave up stale toast for Lent.

456
00:42:00,545 --> 00:42:03,119
- Lent?
- Nothing.

457
00:42:03,882 --> 00:42:05,874
<i>Same old Doris.</i>

458
00:42:06,009 --> 00:42:09,092
<i>She used to get smoked turkey
so it would keep for months.</i>

459
00:42:09,221 --> 00:42:11,972
<i>When it finally went bad,
she'd feed it to the maid.</i>

460
00:42:12,097 --> 00:42:16,048
I had some smoked turkey. I guess
the cleaning woman had it for her lunch.

461
00:42:16,186 --> 00:42:18,428
Oh, here's some pâté.

462
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,182
Cleaning woman.

463
00:42:25,862 --> 00:42:28,104
Cleaning woman.

464
00:42:28,656 --> 00:42:30,898
Cleaning woman!

465
00:42:31,284 --> 00:42:34,451
Cleaning woman! Cleaning woman!

466
00:42:34,955 --> 00:42:37,280
Cleaning woman! Cleaning woman!

467
00:42:53,056 --> 00:42:54,219
Sorry.

468
00:42:57,269 --> 00:43:02,263
<i>I was too embarrassed to ask Doris for
a favour after I'd tried to strangle her...</i>

469
00:43:02,399 --> 00:43:05,849
<i>...so I went to the next name
in my little black book.</i>

470
00:43:05,986 --> 00:43:10,778
<i>The blondest one on my list was a rich
society dame named Jimmi Sue Altfeld.</i>

471
00:43:10,907 --> 00:43:15,699
<i>I almost hated to use her - she was so
in love with me, it nearly made me sick.</i>

472
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:18,236
<i>But business was more important.</i>

473
00:43:18,373 --> 00:43:21,374
<i>I wined her and dined her
at the Plantation Club.</i>

474
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,743
<i>Then I made my move.</i>

475
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:29,548
Last time we saw each other, I left you
alone sitting at a counter at Schwab's.

476
00:43:30,342 --> 00:43:33,547
- You don't hate me for that, do you?
- Of course I don't.

477
00:43:33,889 --> 00:43:35,595
Good...

478
00:43:35,724 --> 00:43:38,393
I'd like to discuss something with you.

479
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,264
- Where to?
- Take me home.

480
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,690
<i>There was no way I was gonna
take her home. Her father hated me.</i>

481
00:43:46,818 --> 00:43:51,112
<i>So I told her to meet me at a motel and
I'd show her something with my hands.</i>

482
00:44:23,647 --> 00:44:25,888
Come in.

483
00:44:30,278 --> 00:44:32,151
Well, Jimmi Sue, you ready?

484
00:44:33,073 --> 00:44:35,480
What are we going to do?

485
00:44:36,243 --> 00:44:38,697
Kinsey from cover to cover.

486
00:44:54,469 --> 00:44:59,048
Has anyone ever told you that your lips
are like two succulent Brussels sprouts...

487
00:44:59,182 --> 00:45:03,310
...waiting to be buttered and bitten?
- Plenty of men have.

488
00:45:04,229 --> 00:45:06,471
Really?

489
00:45:07,691 --> 00:45:09,482
Have these men ever told you...

490
00:45:09,609 --> 00:45:14,485
...that your eyes are like Chinese coins
with dollops of caviar in the centre?

491
00:45:14,614 --> 00:45:17,105
Can't you see how happy
you and I would be here?

492
00:45:17,242 --> 00:45:21,702
Yes, I do. But I want you to come
back to the city with me first.

493
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:27,286
I'm working on an important case. It's
dangerous, and you'll probably be killed.

494
00:45:27,418 --> 00:45:30,787
- But if you love me, you'll do it.
- Yes, I do love you.

495
00:45:30,922 --> 00:45:36,426
And I love you. And I mean that more
than anything I've ever said in my life.

496
00:45:47,772 --> 00:45:52,648
<i>I rented an apartment and started giving
Jimmi instructions on how to pump Neff.</i>

497
00:45:52,777 --> 00:45:55,814
<i>She took direction
like a pig takes to garbage.</i>

498
00:45:55,947 --> 00:45:58,023
Here's a picture of our Mr Neff.

499
00:45:58,158 --> 00:46:00,826
Do, uh, whatever you have to...

500
00:46:00,952 --> 00:46:03,656
...to find out what happened
<i>on the Immer Essen.</i>

501
00:46:03,788 --> 00:46:07,370
Your father threatened to have me
beat up if I continue to see ya.

502
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:11,166
Thought I'd drop over there tomorrow
with a little peace offering.

503
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:13,668
What could I take that'd soften him up?

504
00:46:13,798 --> 00:46:16,254
He never had a dog when he was a boy.

505
00:46:17,135 --> 00:46:19,377
Never had a dog, huh?

506
00:46:29,356 --> 00:46:31,313
Mr Altfeld?

507
00:46:35,195 --> 00:46:37,567
Totally house-broken.

508
00:46:38,448 --> 00:46:41,200
His name is... Ramon.

509
00:46:41,576 --> 00:46:43,818
He's yours.

510
00:46:49,667 --> 00:46:52,123
Get out, thief!

511
00:46:52,253 --> 00:46:56,999
I'm not stealing your daughter. I'm just
borrowing her for an important case.

512
00:46:57,551 --> 00:47:02,889
Don't go near my daughter. Don't try
to see her. Don't write and don't phone.

513
00:47:03,014 --> 00:47:05,719
Can I use her underwear to make soup?

514
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:08,342
- Get out!
- Mr Altfeld...

515
00:47:08,478 --> 00:47:11,562
...by helping me,
your daughter's life is in danger.

516
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:15,354
But she may save hundreds of lives.
You wouldn't stand in the way of that.

517
00:47:15,485 --> 00:47:17,525
Why certainly I would!

518
00:47:17,821 --> 00:47:22,363
I'd frame you or kill you...
if it would protect my daughter.

519
00:47:23,201 --> 00:47:27,447
And I brought you a puppy,
something you never had as a boy.

520
00:47:27,581 --> 00:47:29,822
Now get out!

521
00:47:30,458 --> 00:47:32,913
Come on, Ramon.

522
00:47:35,212 --> 00:47:37,288
You don't deserve a puppy.

523
00:47:39,134 --> 00:47:40,924
Wait!

524
00:47:42,178 --> 00:47:44,419
Pick that up.

525
00:47:45,807 --> 00:47:49,009
- But it's all soft and steamy.
- Pick that up!

526
00:47:52,062 --> 00:47:54,519
You're a sick man, Altfeld.

527
00:48:02,072 --> 00:48:06,819
You can make me pick up dog dirt,
but you can't stop me seeing Jimmi Sue.

528
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:16,165
- You want a puppy?
- I'd love a dog.

529
00:48:17,172 --> 00:48:18,915
Thank you.

530
00:48:19,048 --> 00:48:22,252
- Here's something for you, too.
- Oh, thank you.

531
00:48:24,345 --> 00:48:25,425
Eugh!

532
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:33,468
Well, Larry, Moe and Curly.

533
00:48:38,026 --> 00:48:40,398
Thanks, Dan.

534
00:48:40,528 --> 00:48:43,446
Not a nice way to treat
a friend of Mr Altfeld's daughter.

535
00:48:43,573 --> 00:48:45,732
<i>There's only one way to treat you.</i>

536
00:48:50,037 --> 00:48:52,327
You got some
pretty smart monkeys here.

537
00:48:54,793 --> 00:48:58,291
I notice this one's wearing
a Phi Beta Kappa key here.

538
00:49:01,258 --> 00:49:04,757
- Ow!
- Your move.

539
00:49:04,885 --> 00:49:07,423
I'm gonna have some sense
beaten into you.

540
00:49:08,265 --> 00:49:12,594
What's he payin' you boys? I'll double it
and we'll beat the shit outta him.

541
00:49:12,727 --> 00:49:14,968
All right, Dan.

542
00:49:56,646 --> 00:49:58,685
Rigby?

543
00:50:01,192 --> 00:50:03,232
Rigby?

544
00:50:06,155 --> 00:50:08,195
Rigby?

545
00:50:33,516 --> 00:50:35,474
Juliet!

546
00:50:35,602 --> 00:50:39,219
Those dirty bastards!
Beating up a woman.

547
00:50:42,067 --> 00:50:44,902
They even knocked
your breasts out of whack.

548
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:47,860
Rigby?

549
00:50:48,697 --> 00:50:51,368
Juliet... Are you all right?

550
00:50:51,868 --> 00:50:53,493
Oh!

551
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:55,658
Yes, I'm fine.

552
00:50:56,997 --> 00:51:00,083
- You look awful.
- It's all in a day's work.

553
00:51:01,169 --> 00:51:04,087
No, Rigby. It's not worth it.

554
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:09,174
- I want you to quit.
- Why? Because I've been roughed up?

555
00:51:09,302 --> 00:51:12,007
You've also been shot and drugged...

556
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:15,765
...and probably had to go to bed
with women you didn't know.

557
00:51:15,892 --> 00:51:19,390
You're just upset
about me interviewing blondes.

558
00:51:19,521 --> 00:51:21,846
You can forget about it.

559
00:51:34,952 --> 00:51:38,037
I've decided to get
the information myself.

560
00:51:40,083 --> 00:51:42,123
How?

561
00:51:44,045 --> 00:51:46,452
By disguising myself
as a beautiful blonde.

562
00:52:11,489 --> 00:52:14,407
- Do I look like a dame?
- Not as much as I do.

563
00:52:14,868 --> 00:52:19,030
- I haven't turned on the charm yet.
- Rigby, I wish you'd let me go instead.

564
00:52:19,164 --> 00:52:22,080
Have Neff try and feel you up?
No chance, Dollface.

565
00:52:22,209 --> 00:52:24,960
Oh. You don't want
Mr Neff to feel me up?

566
00:52:25,085 --> 00:52:28,454
That doesn't mean you're beginning
to... care for me, does it?

567
00:52:28,590 --> 00:52:31,425
I don't want
any of my clients felt up.

568
00:52:31,718 --> 00:52:36,961
I'm late. Neff cruises supermarkets
every Thursday looking for blondes.

569
00:52:37,098 --> 00:52:39,554
If I'm half the woman I think I am...

570
00:52:39,684 --> 00:52:42,353
...I'll have a date with Neff by tonight.

571
00:52:43,396 --> 00:52:45,685
Good luck.

572
00:52:46,566 --> 00:52:50,231
<i>Neff's favourite hunting ground
was Jerry's Market on Melrose.</i>

573
00:52:50,361 --> 00:52:54,193
<i>I spotted him right away and
sidled down the aisle opposite him.</i>

574
00:52:54,324 --> 00:52:57,527
<i>I was wearing a special perfume
called "Fondle Me".</i>

575
00:52:57,661 --> 00:53:01,493
<i>Its aroma drew Neff to me
like fat to a mother-in-law.</i>

576
00:53:04,751 --> 00:53:08,915
<i>He was a ladies' man, all right.
He made me feel beautiful, alive.</i>

577
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:13,339
<i>He asked me up to his place,
and I didn't play hard to get.</i>

578
00:53:13,468 --> 00:53:15,709
All right.

579
00:53:17,264 --> 00:53:21,593
<i>On his home ground, Neff was
more aggressive and I played along.</i>

580
00:53:24,521 --> 00:53:29,147
- I'm crazy about you, baby.
- I'm crazy about you too, Walter.

581
00:53:29,276 --> 00:53:31,517
That perfume. What's the name of it?

582
00:53:31,653 --> 00:53:33,444
"Fondle Me".

583
00:53:33,572 --> 00:53:35,610
Silly!

584
00:53:36,198 --> 00:53:38,441
That's the name of the perfume.

585
00:53:39,536 --> 00:53:42,821
- I feel like a drink.
- All I've got is bourbon.

586
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:45,573
I'll make the drinks.

587
00:53:49,212 --> 00:53:51,454
Sit over there.

588
00:54:04,394 --> 00:54:09,222
<i>I wanted to knock him out fast. I slipped
him 15 milligrams of Aphrodisiamil...</i>

589
00:54:09,357 --> 00:54:13,437
<i>...and hoped it would take effect
before he tried to pick my lock.</i>

590
00:54:28,876 --> 00:54:32,080
Sorry, Walter. That's as far
as I go on a first date.

591
00:55:14,673 --> 00:55:18,089
<i>I didn't know what I was looking for,
but what I found was dynamite.</i>

592
00:55:18,218 --> 00:55:21,917
<i>The passenger list of
the Immer Essen's final cruise.</i>

593
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:26,012
<i>It was the same as
the Carlotta "Enemies" list.</i>

594
00:55:28,019 --> 00:55:31,969
<i>One name rang a bell. Cody Jarrett,
captain of the Immer Essen.</i>

595
00:55:32,107 --> 00:55:37,267
<i>I went to the public library and looked
up everything I could on Captain Jarrett.</i>

596
00:55:38,696 --> 00:55:41,532
"Framed Because He Knew Too Much."

597
00:55:41,658 --> 00:55:45,821
"But He Refuses to Divulge What
He Knew to Anyone but His Mother."

598
00:55:46,788 --> 00:55:50,738
<i>I hoped to find out why the passengers
on the Immer Essen's final cruise...</i>

599
00:55:50,876 --> 00:55:53,331
<i>...were being knocked off one by one.</i>

600
00:55:53,461 --> 00:55:56,712
<i>They all must have
seen something. But what?</i>

601
00:55:58,132 --> 00:55:59,330
What do you think?

602
00:55:59,467 --> 00:56:02,219
I think you enjoy
dressing up as a woman.

603
00:56:02,345 --> 00:56:05,382
Jarrett's mother's
the only visitor he'll talk to.

604
00:56:05,515 --> 00:56:09,643
And I think I look enough like her
to get a gift on Mother's Day.

605
00:56:22,157 --> 00:56:24,196
Rigby, wait!

606
00:56:25,493 --> 00:56:27,781
Don't... don't call me Rigby.

607
00:56:28,663 --> 00:56:30,952
I'm worried.
Since you were beaten up...

608
00:56:31,082 --> 00:56:35,460
...I've had nightmares about
something awful happening to you.

609
00:56:35,587 --> 00:56:38,042
I care about you, Rigby.

610
00:56:40,008 --> 00:56:42,250
What?

611
00:56:42,384 --> 00:56:44,627
I care about you.

612
00:56:47,849 --> 00:56:50,091
What's the matter?

613
00:56:50,225 --> 00:56:52,634
You. You're the matter.

614
00:56:53,313 --> 00:56:56,433
Did... did I... do something wrong?

615
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:00,232
Yeah. You crept into my gut.

616
00:57:00,362 --> 00:57:04,359
You've got me thinking silly thoughts,
like... hanging up my gun for good.

617
00:57:04,491 --> 00:57:07,112
Becoming a one-woman guy.

618
00:57:07,242 --> 00:57:10,529
Settling down in
an ivy-covered cottage...

619
00:57:10,663 --> 00:57:12,786
...raking leaves out of the backyard...

620
00:57:12,916 --> 00:57:15,407
...squeezing orange juice
for you in the morning.

621
00:57:15,544 --> 00:57:17,666
You'd do that for me?

622
00:57:20,465 --> 00:57:22,837
- Yeah, I would.
- Oh, Rigby.

623
00:57:58,502 --> 00:58:00,745
Cody Jarrett's mother.

624
00:58:10,265 --> 00:58:12,174
Hello, Ma.

625
00:58:13,018 --> 00:58:15,768
My name is Reardon.
I have important news for you.

626
00:58:15,896 --> 00:58:18,183
So just pretend I'm your ma, OK?

627
00:58:18,315 --> 00:58:22,726
The paper said you were hit in the head
by a flying wrench in the machine shop.

628
00:58:22,861 --> 00:58:25,897
Friends of Carlotta are
after you because you know too much.

629
00:58:26,031 --> 00:58:29,564
- I see what you mean.
- So the flying wrench was no accident.

630
00:58:29,701 --> 00:58:31,610
For a minute I thought it was.

631
00:58:31,745 --> 00:58:34,698
Something like that
may happen again, so...

632
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:38,031
The guard looks suspicious.
Act like I'm your ma.

633
00:58:38,168 --> 00:58:41,252
- Sure.
- Pretend I'm crying. You comfort me.

634
00:58:45,383 --> 00:58:47,008
Relax, Ma.

635
00:58:49,679 --> 00:58:52,964
Say something like, uh,
"No, no, Ma. Look, listen to me."

636
00:58:53,099 --> 00:58:55,851
No, no, Ma. Look, listen to me.

637
00:58:57,062 --> 00:58:59,600
That was good. Real good.

638
00:59:00,314 --> 00:59:03,150
Look, as long as the other
prisoners can get to you...

639
00:59:03,276 --> 00:59:05,980
...you're not safe.
But don't worry, I have a plan.

640
00:59:06,112 --> 00:59:08,650
<i>I contacted Warden Dudley,
who owed me a favour.</i>

641
00:59:08,782 --> 00:59:12,910
<i>I asked him to let me pose as a prisoner
so I could keep an eye on Jarrett...</i>

642
00:59:13,035 --> 00:59:15,242
<i>...maybe learn something about Carlotta.</i>

643
00:59:15,372 --> 00:59:19,072
<i>I learned fast. Jarrett had
a prison break planned that very night.</i>

644
00:59:19,209 --> 00:59:23,787
<i>I was invited along... at gunpoint.
When they stuffed me in the trunk...</i>

645
00:59:23,922 --> 00:59:27,670
<i>...I realised he was a friend
of Carlotta, and I was their enemy.</i>

646
00:59:28,759 --> 00:59:32,259
Ryley, you get in the front.
And you, you drive.

647
00:59:33,597 --> 00:59:36,172
<i>I bounced along in that trunk
a long time.</i>

648
00:59:36,308 --> 00:59:41,552
<i>Five hours later, I had given up hope of
ever going to a regular bathroom again.</i>

649
00:59:42,022 --> 00:59:44,894
<i>I decided to have a little chat
with Captain Jarrett.</i>

650
00:59:45,025 --> 00:59:47,482
Hey, Cody!

651
00:59:52,784 --> 00:59:55,452
- How ya doin', partner?
- I can't breathe.

652
00:59:55,578 --> 00:59:57,618
Oh. Stuffy, huh?

653
00:59:57,789 --> 01:00:00,244
- I'll give you a little air.
- Thanks.

654
01:00:08,174 --> 01:00:13,050
<i>Her lips were warm, and my arm wasn't
the only thing that was throbbing.</i>

655
01:00:13,179 --> 01:00:15,504
<i>Our hearts were, too.</i>

656
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:18,973
<i>My plan was to kiss her
with every lip on my face...</i>

657
01:00:19,644 --> 01:00:24,057
<i>...then slowly move her to the next room,
manoeuvre her next to the bed...</i>

658
01:00:24,732 --> 01:00:27,817
<i>...marry her, and start
the whoopee machine.</i>

659
01:00:28,737 --> 01:00:30,776
<i>My plan was working fine until...</i>

660
01:00:30,906 --> 01:00:33,989
Agh! You stuck your finger
in my bullet hole.

661
01:00:34,117 --> 01:00:36,573
- Sorry, Rigby.
- I'll be all right.

662
01:00:38,579 --> 01:00:40,572
Why don't you lie down?

663
01:00:40,706 --> 01:00:44,621
I'll go to the drugstore
and get you something for your arm.

664
01:00:46,379 --> 01:00:49,049
It's raining too hard.
Call a cab. Hurry back.

665
01:00:49,174 --> 01:00:51,463
I feel like kissing somebody.

666
01:00:51,593 --> 01:00:54,001
Don't start without me.

667
01:01:02,646 --> 01:01:04,437
Hello?

668
01:01:04,563 --> 01:01:06,223
<i>- It's me, Margaret.</i>
- Who?

669
01:01:06,358 --> 01:01:08,149
<i>- Margaret.</i>
- Margaret?

670
01:01:08,275 --> 01:01:10,850
<i>Margaret Croyden.</i>

671
01:01:10,986 --> 01:01:13,905
Margaret Croyden? I don't believe it!

672
01:01:14,990 --> 01:01:18,028
- I don't believe you'd call me.
- I'd have called sooner...

673
01:01:18,161 --> 01:01:20,617
- You shouldn't call at all.
- It's so quiet here.

674
01:01:20,747 --> 01:01:23,701
Oh, Victor's gone
for the weekend, huh?

675
01:01:23,832 --> 01:01:26,241
Sorry. Not interested.

676
01:01:28,379 --> 01:01:32,247
Because I'm in love. Yeah, really in love.

677
01:01:35,178 --> 01:01:39,258
A few days ago I said something
to a woman I thought I'd never say.

678
01:01:39,641 --> 01:01:43,888
I actually said "I want to settle down
in an ivy-covered cottage with you...

679
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:46,511
<i>...rake leaves out of the backyard...</i>

680
01:01:46,648 --> 01:01:49,851
<i>...squeeze orange juice
for you in the morning."</i>

681
01:01:49,985 --> 01:01:53,104
<i>I spoke to Victor.
He'll give me the divorce.</i>

682
01:01:53,237 --> 01:01:56,773
<i>I'll tell you what. Come down
tomorrow. We'll drive back together.</i>

683
01:01:56,908 --> 01:02:01,902
<i>Wonderful! I can't wait to
come bouncing back into your life again.</i>

684
01:02:05,541 --> 01:02:08,163
No dice, Margaret.
Call me in another 12 years.

685
01:02:08,295 --> 01:02:10,536
All right, darling.

686
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,992
- Hello?
<i>- Mr Reardon...</i>

687
01:02:49,127 --> 01:02:52,081
<i>...I have decided to close this case
as of this moment.</i>

688
01:02:52,212 --> 01:02:55,581
A cheque will be in the mail
for you tomorrow.

689
01:02:55,717 --> 01:02:59,465
Please do not try to contact me
as I will be out of town for some time.

690
01:02:59,971 --> 01:03:02,842
Juliet, has someone
got a gun to your head?

691
01:03:03,683 --> 01:03:05,142
Juliet!

692
01:03:09,188 --> 01:03:11,514
<i>A half-bottle of bourbon later
I still couldn't believe it.</i>

693
01:03:11,649 --> 01:03:13,856
<i>Was Juliet crazy like her sister?</i>

694
01:03:13,985 --> 01:03:18,398
<i>Had she fallen in love with the cab
driver on the way to the drugstore?</i>

695
01:03:18,531 --> 01:03:22,612
<i>Or was she a member of the Carlotta
conspiracy and had set me up?</i>

696
01:03:22,744 --> 01:03:26,112
<i>Finally, I arrived at
a very important conclusion.</i>

697
01:03:26,789 --> 01:03:29,032
Shit on her!

698
01:03:41,930 --> 01:03:44,385
All dames are alike.

699
01:03:45,934 --> 01:03:49,432
They reach down your throat,
grab your heart... and pull it out.

700
01:03:49,563 --> 01:03:54,224
They throw it on the floor... and
they step on it with their high heels.

701
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:59,028
They spit on it, shove it in the oven,
then cook the shit out of it.

702
01:04:00,614 --> 01:04:03,782
They slice it into little pieces,
slam it on a hunk of toast...

703
01:04:03,909 --> 01:04:06,366
...and they serve it to ya.

704
01:04:06,496 --> 01:04:10,197
They expect you to say
"Thanks, honey, it's delicious."

705
01:04:13,086 --> 01:04:16,289
Well, it's not delicious, Juliet Forrest.

706
01:04:16,423 --> 01:04:18,664
It's rotten.

707
01:04:19,174 --> 01:04:21,749
I don't give a damn
if I ever hear from you again.

708
01:04:28,017 --> 01:04:29,677
- Juliet?
- This is Alan.

709
01:04:29,811 --> 01:04:31,934
Alan?

710
01:04:32,605 --> 01:04:36,520
- Come on, Marlowe, no games.
- I never could fool you, could I?

711
01:04:37,944 --> 01:04:40,020
No.

712
01:04:40,154 --> 01:04:42,064
Listen, Marlowe.

713
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:44,863
Juliet left me, and...

714
01:04:46,035 --> 01:04:48,787
...I feel like I've been hit
with a wet frying pan.

715
01:04:48,914 --> 01:04:50,990
How the hell do you pick up the pieces?

716
01:04:51,124 --> 01:04:55,073
I'm beginning to realise it's better
to have something to look forward to.

717
01:04:55,212 --> 01:04:58,166
"Look forward to." Like what? Work?

718
01:04:58,297 --> 01:05:00,207
I can't get a break on this case.

719
01:05:00,342 --> 01:05:02,962
I don't even know who the hell
this Carlotta dame is.

720
01:05:03,094 --> 01:05:05,549
<i>Can you get a map of South America?</i>

721
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:08,254
- Yeah. You got something?
- Look up Peru.

722
01:05:12,687 --> 01:05:13,553
Got it!

723
01:05:13,688 --> 01:05:16,559
There's a little town
on the coast called Paita.

724
01:05:16,691 --> 01:05:19,099
<i>Tell me where it is.</i>

725
01:05:21,196 --> 01:05:24,279
It's right next to
a tiny little island called...

726
01:05:24,406 --> 01:05:27,611
You son of a gun! Carlotta!

727
01:05:28,745 --> 01:05:31,116
Damn! It's not a woman's name.

728
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:34,448
It's a place.

729
01:05:34,583 --> 01:05:37,206
- Thanks, Marlowe. I owe ya.
- Good.

730
01:05:37,337 --> 01:05:40,338
I'm leaving for Carlotta right now.

731
01:05:40,465 --> 01:05:43,799
Even if Juliet's gone,
I'm gonna solve this case...

732
01:05:43,927 --> 01:05:48,007
...no matter how many killers are
involved, even if Juliet's one of 'em.

733
01:05:48,138 --> 01:05:50,809
Any idea where in Carlotta
I should start looking?

734
01:05:50,934 --> 01:05:53,555
<i>There's a little café right on the bay.</i>

735
01:05:54,938 --> 01:06:00,063
<i>When I arrived, I thought of the words
Marlowe had said to me 15 years ago:</i>

736
01:06:01,069 --> 01:06:03,394
<i>"Dead men don't wear plaid."</i>

737
01:06:05,907 --> 01:06:08,232
<i>Dead men don't wear plaid.</i>

738
01:06:09,578 --> 01:06:12,198
<i>I still don't know what it means.</i>

739
01:06:13,290 --> 01:06:17,369
<i>Carlotta was the kind of town where
they spell trouble t-r-u-b-i-l...</i>

740
01:06:17,502 --> 01:06:20,787
<i>...and if you try to
correct them, they kill you.</i>

741
01:06:35,729 --> 01:06:37,805
<i>I knew Marlowe had steered me right.</i>

742
01:06:37,939 --> 01:06:41,770
<i>There was Kitty Collins, the girl
who ditched me in Santa Barbara.</i>

743
01:06:44,070 --> 01:06:46,396
Señor Reardon.

744
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:53,902
Manuel Alesandro.

745
01:06:57,334 --> 01:06:59,243
Not quite.

746
01:06:59,376 --> 01:07:01,335
Carlos Rodriguez.

747
01:07:03,757 --> 01:07:05,666
- Carlos Rodriguez?
<i>- Sí.</i>

748
01:07:06,051 --> 01:07:10,428
Before the war...
we ran guns to the rebels.

749
01:07:12,097 --> 01:07:13,925
Oh, yeah.

750
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:16,467
You're a cop.

751
01:07:16,603 --> 01:07:18,512
<i>Sí, sí, sí.</i>

752
01:07:18,646 --> 01:07:20,972
I have joined the establishment.

753
01:07:22,484 --> 01:07:27,395
That's good, Carlos. I'm here on an
investigation. Maybe you can help me.

754
01:07:27,529 --> 01:07:30,068
There is much to investigate in Carlotta.

755
01:07:30,867 --> 01:07:33,572
The whole island is like a powder keg.

756
01:07:33,703 --> 01:07:37,914
There is much tension, the...
the smell of something rotten.

757
01:07:39,125 --> 01:07:43,039
That's what I'm here for.
To find out what it is that smells.

758
01:07:43,171 --> 01:07:44,748
Psst!

759
01:07:44,881 --> 01:07:49,258
Be careful of the, uh,
fat one who sweats a lot.

760
01:07:51,804 --> 01:07:53,180
What about Kitty Collins?

761
01:07:53,306 --> 01:07:56,639
She doesn't sweat as much,
but she's just as dangerous.

762
01:07:56,767 --> 01:07:59,140
# What you want

763
01:07:59,271 --> 01:08:01,309
# Everybody wants

764
01:08:05,651 --> 01:08:08,108
They say she is one of them.

765
01:08:08,904 --> 01:08:11,313
Who is..."them"?

766
01:08:11,992 --> 01:08:15,491
Nobody knows.
Only they know who is "them".

767
01:08:16,371 --> 01:08:20,120
But there is a man.
<i>His name is Arroz. Rice.</i>

768
01:08:21,792 --> 01:08:24,283
Kitty Collins is in love with him.

769
01:08:25,045 --> 01:08:27,372
He is a killer.

770
01:08:27,506 --> 01:08:29,796
Rice, huh?

771
01:08:30,594 --> 01:08:33,085
- Thanks, Carlos.
<i>- De nada, señor.</i>

772
01:08:35,223 --> 01:08:38,259
- Where are you staying?
- Hotel Guano.

773
01:08:38,393 --> 01:08:41,228
Ha! I'll be in touch.

774
01:08:41,353 --> 01:08:43,810
<i>Cuidado, Señor Reardon.</i>

775
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:47,523
<i>Cuidado, Carlos... <i>Cuidado. </i></i>

776
01:08:47,652 --> 01:08:51,103
<i>I wanted Kitty Collins
to tell "them" I was in town...</i>

777
01:08:51,239 --> 01:08:54,572
<i>...so I tossed a five-pesetaria coin
into the bowl.</i>

778
01:08:54,826 --> 01:08:57,827
<i>The clank was loud enough
to make her look my way.</i>

779
01:08:58,162 --> 01:09:02,326
<i>That five-pesetaria coin was
the best investment I ever made.</i>

780
01:09:02,458 --> 01:09:07,619
<i>The next day, I hooked a big fish:
A fat one who sweats a lot.</i>

781
01:09:10,133 --> 01:09:13,882
<i>- Señor?</i>
- Nothing alcoholic. Oh, a beer, maybe.

782
01:09:14,346 --> 01:09:16,006
<i>Sí, señor.</i>

783
01:09:16,889 --> 01:09:19,345
Hard liquor goes to my feet.

784
01:09:22,019 --> 01:09:25,104
Just a minute, Mr Rigby.

785
01:09:25,982 --> 01:09:28,520
We know who you are, Mr Rigby.

786
01:09:28,652 --> 01:09:30,609
I'm interested. Who am I?

787
01:09:30,736 --> 01:09:34,023
You could be a guy
who collects $10,000...

788
01:09:34,699 --> 01:09:36,858
...just to leave this stinkin' town.

789
01:09:36,993 --> 01:09:39,663
- I could, could I?
- You know who I could be?

790
01:09:41,706 --> 01:09:43,913
Hunchback of Notre Dame?

791
01:09:44,041 --> 01:09:48,537
I could be the guy
who hands ya... them $10,000.

792
01:09:49,463 --> 01:09:53,081
$10,000. Me to you... just like that.

793
01:09:53,218 --> 01:09:57,465
Sorry. My price for leaving
stinking towns is 11,500...

794
01:09:57,596 --> 01:10:00,383
...and a kiss on the lips
from Carmen Miranda.

795
01:10:00,517 --> 01:10:04,384
Pass it on to "them". Room 204.

796
01:10:05,605 --> 01:10:07,313
Room 204, señora.

797
01:10:17,449 --> 01:10:19,277
Come in.

798
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:24,121
Right on time, Kitty. Been expecting ya.

799
01:10:24,249 --> 01:10:26,490
Thought you'd come last night.

800
01:10:26,626 --> 01:10:29,746
- I wasn't thinking too well last night.
- Keep talking.

801
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:32,714
You see, I just
found out something, Rigby.

802
01:10:33,592 --> 01:10:37,589
Who you are, what you do,
and why you're in Carlotta.

803
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:40,176
I'm here to bust up your game.

804
01:10:43,226 --> 01:10:48,053
I don't get it. A class girl like you
in love with a killer like Rice.

805
01:10:48,189 --> 01:10:50,810
Who... what... why?

806
01:10:50,942 --> 01:10:52,982
When you love someone...

807
01:10:53,110 --> 01:10:57,357
...I guess it doesn't make
any difference who, what or why.

808
01:10:57,490 --> 01:10:59,945
You go right on loving them.

809
01:11:02,078 --> 01:11:04,319
Yeah, you do, don't ya?

810
01:11:05,207 --> 01:11:07,661
I feel as if...

811
01:11:12,254 --> 01:11:15,126
Make me another drink, will you, baby?

812
01:11:19,845 --> 01:11:21,802
Hello?

813
01:11:21,932 --> 01:11:24,423
<i>- What's up, amigo?</i>
- Plenty.

814
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:28,435
A plane arrived today, and
all the passengers spoke German.

815
01:11:28,562 --> 01:11:32,014
- German?
<i>- Mm-hm. Our friend Rice was there.</i>

816
01:11:32,150 --> 01:11:35,233
They gave him a packet.
It was marked today's date...

817
01:11:35,362 --> 01:11:37,899
...and "Final Instructions".
- How do you know?

818
01:11:38,031 --> 01:11:42,942
I was hired to protect Rice until he
gets on that plane with Kitty Collins...

819
01:11:43,078 --> 01:11:45,651
<i>...tonight after the Carlotta Festival.</i>

820
01:11:46,706 --> 01:11:48,533
<i>Why are you telling me this?</i>

821
01:11:48,666 --> 01:11:51,620
Because the lives of
millions of innocent p...

822
01:11:51,753 --> 01:11:54,125
Carlos? Carlos!

823
01:11:55,256 --> 01:11:57,296
Carlos!

824
01:11:57,425 --> 01:11:59,465
Damn.

825
01:12:06,476 --> 01:12:08,883
Where are you and Rice headed tonight?

826
01:12:09,271 --> 01:12:12,141
What do you know about
a plane with Germermans on it?

827
01:12:12,274 --> 01:12:14,313
Germerm... Germans.

828
01:12:15,193 --> 01:12:17,233
Germermans.

829
01:12:18,196 --> 01:12:21,565
There's a plane with mermans on it.

830
01:12:23,410 --> 01:12:25,734
The plane's in town.

831
01:12:27,038 --> 01:12:29,279
Ethel Merman came in on it.

832
01:12:35,338 --> 01:12:37,875
Wanna go see Ethel Merman with me?

833
01:12:39,426 --> 01:12:41,668
I'll buy two tickets.

834
01:12:41,802 --> 01:12:45,137
Let me get on my pyjamas,
I'll be ready to go.

835
01:12:46,850 --> 01:12:49,007
<i>I'd done some brilliant things
in my time.</i>

836
01:12:49,144 --> 01:12:53,058
<i>Asking Kitty Collins to mix me
a drink wasn't one of them.</i>

837
01:12:54,733 --> 01:12:58,813
<i>When I came to, I could make out
only light and shadow at first.</i>

838
01:12:58,944 --> 01:13:02,231
<i>Then I saw an unfamiliar face.
But even in my stupor...</i>

839
01:13:02,364 --> 01:13:06,529
<i>...I knew he was one of the big fish
in the conspiracy: Rice!</i>

840
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:08,950
Well, I believe
that about winds things up.

841
01:13:09,456 --> 01:13:13,121
<i>- I'm gonna wind you up on a rope.</i>
- But you're the one who's gonna die.

842
01:13:13,251 --> 01:13:18,162
Better make it look good. If anything
fishy happens to me, the FBI...

843
01:13:18,298 --> 01:13:19,840
It'll look very natural.

844
01:13:19,966 --> 01:13:24,129
People who know Rigby Reardon
know I'd never die a natural death.

845
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:28,387
Do you think
I'd leave you around to talk?!

846
01:13:28,516 --> 01:13:30,722
You've already talked too much!

847
01:13:37,984 --> 01:13:40,060
Hold it, Rice!

848
01:13:40,570 --> 01:13:43,939
You're not getting on that plane
tonight. I want those papers.

849
01:13:44,074 --> 01:13:47,157
I'm gonna walk out of this room.
You won't shoot.

850
01:13:47,285 --> 01:13:49,526
I won't?

851
01:13:50,539 --> 01:13:54,999
That was a warning shot, Rice. And I
don't fire as many of 'em as I used to.

852
01:14:08,431 --> 01:14:10,553
<i>Rigby! Señor!</i>

853
01:14:10,684 --> 01:14:12,722
- I heard shots.
- I'm all right.

854
01:14:12,852 --> 01:14:15,140
- Rice went that way.
- Come on, Carlos!

855
01:14:15,272 --> 01:14:19,104
Are you wearing pyjamas?
<i>Señor, I'll help you take them off.</i>

856
01:14:20,734 --> 01:14:23,440
I don't need help
with my pyjamas! Stop!

857
01:14:23,572 --> 01:14:25,444
<i>- Sí.</i>
- Carlos!

858
01:14:25,572 --> 01:14:30,033
<i>Sí. Don't worry about your pyjamas,</i>
<i>señor. I'll take care of them.</i>

859
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:33,328
Out of the way!
We are chasing a killer!

860
01:14:33,455 --> 01:14:35,912
Everybody stand back! He's with me.

861
01:14:37,961 --> 01:14:40,084
Coming through!

862
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:43,625
<i>Señor!</i>

863
01:14:43,757 --> 01:14:45,798
<i>Cuidado, señor. Cuidado!</i>

864
01:14:47,053 --> 01:14:49,722
- Stand back!
<i>- Cuidado!</i>

865
01:14:51,349 --> 01:14:53,507
<i>Señor! Your pyjamas!</i>

866
01:14:53,643 --> 01:14:56,216
Forget the pyjamas!

867
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:01,516
- Are you all right?
- It's just a bullet.

868
01:15:01,651 --> 01:15:05,151
My wife Carmelita
<i>will suck it out. Go ahead, señor.</i>

869
01:15:05,906 --> 01:15:10,116
And don't worry about your pyjamas.
I'll take care of them!

870
01:15:58,333 --> 01:16:00,575
"Final Instructions".

871
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,421
So that's their game.

872
01:16:18,394 --> 01:16:20,635
"Rasmussen Place".

873
01:16:41,418 --> 01:16:45,665
<i>The last thing I expected to see
was Juliet and her father, alive...</i>

874
01:16:45,796 --> 01:16:49,794
<i>...talking with their butler,
who was dressed in a Nazi uniform.</i>

875
01:16:49,926 --> 01:16:52,463
<i>Yeah. That explained a lot.</i>

876
01:16:52,596 --> 01:16:56,011
<i>Why Juliet was able
to translate German, for one thing.</i>

877
01:16:56,141 --> 01:16:58,430
<i>I'd been played for a sucker.</i>

878
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:01,643
<i>But it wasn't too late
to set things straight.</i>

879
01:17:06,902 --> 01:17:08,774
Yaaah!

880
01:17:11,113 --> 01:17:13,985
OK, hands in the air.
Over on the steps. Let's go!

881
01:17:14,117 --> 01:17:17,949
It's time for a class picture.
Tall ones in back, short ones in front.

882
01:17:18,245 --> 01:17:20,702
Now sit! Hold hands.

883
01:17:21,916 --> 01:17:24,157
Now smile.

884
01:17:24,628 --> 01:17:26,037
- That's nice.
- Rigby...

885
01:17:26,171 --> 01:17:29,455
Hold it! Stay where you are,
you dirty, lying Nazi scum.

886
01:17:29,591 --> 01:17:30,870
Rigby!

887
01:17:31,009 --> 01:17:34,259
I should have known. I fell for
a dame who played me for a sucker.

888
01:17:34,386 --> 01:17:36,925
No, Mr Reardon. She did not
play you for a sucker.

889
01:17:37,056 --> 01:17:43,011
<i>I did. Pretending to be a butler, waiting
on inferior races was galling to me.</i>

890
01:17:43,146 --> 01:17:47,190
- But I fooled everyone.
- You see, Rigby? I didn't betray you.

891
01:17:47,317 --> 01:17:50,353
- How did you know to come here?
- Marlowe told me.

892
01:17:50,486 --> 01:17:53,571
That's how I found Daddy.
I smelled his cheese moulds.

893
01:17:53,698 --> 01:17:56,070
I am sorry to interrupt
such a tender scene...

894
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:58,656
...but we have a plan to carry out now.

895
01:17:59,037 --> 01:18:03,117
- Who are you really, kraut?
- Field Marshal Wilfred von Kluck.

896
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:05,621
- At your service.
- Von Kluck?

897
01:18:05,751 --> 01:18:08,670
Former chief of Hitler's
Special Secret Weapons Corps.

898
01:18:08,796 --> 01:18:11,335
I'm flattered. How did you know?

899
01:18:11,465 --> 01:18:13,922
I figured out
your whole stinking scheme.

900
01:18:14,051 --> 01:18:17,966
How you duped Dr Forrest into helping
you. How you flew in your agents!

901
01:18:18,098 --> 01:18:20,968
The finest officers in the Führer's army.

902
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:25,094
- Former army.
- For the moment.

903
01:18:25,230 --> 01:18:27,138
But we shall rise again.

904
01:18:27,274 --> 01:18:30,310
- We'll see about that.
- How did they use Daddy?

905
01:18:30,443 --> 01:18:34,192
Bullet-head here found out your father
had developed a cheese mould...

906
01:18:34,321 --> 01:18:37,856
...so powerful it could decompose
rocks, trees and mountains.

907
01:18:37,993 --> 01:18:41,196
He devised a plan to dissolve
the entire United States.

908
01:18:41,328 --> 01:18:44,615
At first your father gave
this swine information because...

909
01:18:44,748 --> 01:18:48,413
Please, Mr Reardon.
<i>Allow me to tell the story.</i>

910
01:18:48,877 --> 01:18:51,119
- Your father went along...
- Mr Reardon.

911
01:18:51,256 --> 01:18:55,752
It is customary in these situations for
the developer of the plan to describe it.

912
01:18:55,884 --> 01:19:00,961
I beg your pardon. It's customary for the
private eye to tell how he figured it out.

913
01:19:01,099 --> 01:19:02,926
No, it is my right!

914
01:19:03,058 --> 01:19:06,843
We were able to dupe Dr Forrest by
posing as a humanitarian organisation...

915
01:19:06,980 --> 01:19:10,230
...who planned to wipe out hunger
by ageing cheese faster.

916
01:19:10,358 --> 01:19:14,486
- When he saw what they were doing...
- He assembled lists of our agents...

917
01:19:14,612 --> 01:19:19,440
- And seemed about to go to the FBI...
- We had to drug him and bring him...

918
01:19:19,575 --> 01:19:22,660
Here, faking his death
so there'd be no investigation...

919
01:19:22,787 --> 01:19:25,823
But while testing the mould
on a small island nearby...

920
01:19:25,957 --> 01:19:30,001
<i>The Immer Essen passed by. Some of</i>
the passengers saw the island dissolve...

921
01:19:30,128 --> 01:19:32,797
They were therefore labelled "enemies".

922
01:19:32,923 --> 01:19:35,378
We had Neff cancel
all further tours, and our...

923
01:19:35,508 --> 01:19:39,719
...friends systematically began to
eliminate everyone on that cruise ship!

924
01:19:39,846 --> 01:19:42,302
<i>- Schweinehund!</i>
- Jerk!

925
01:19:44,935 --> 01:19:46,677
Now...

926
01:19:47,687 --> 01:19:50,724
...we are ready.
Our agents have just returned...

927
01:19:50,856 --> 01:19:53,775
...after planting cheese bombs
throughout America.

928
01:19:53,902 --> 01:19:57,352
With America destroyed,
we will win the next war.

929
01:19:57,489 --> 01:19:59,197
And the one after that, too!

930
01:19:59,323 --> 01:20:03,652
When these switches are thrown, your
meddling country will disintegrate...

931
01:20:03,787 --> 01:20:05,778
...like a mouldy hunk of Liederkranz!

932
01:20:05,914 --> 01:20:09,198
Hold the mould, Kluck. Those switches
aren't going to be thrown.

933
01:20:09,334 --> 01:20:13,118
<i>Und I think they will be.</i>

934
01:20:13,255 --> 01:20:15,294
<i>Halt ihn!</i>

935
01:20:18,677 --> 01:20:21,677
Good... good.

936
01:20:23,138 --> 01:20:26,722
I'm sorry to prevent
your becoming a hero, Herr Reardon.

937
01:20:26,850 --> 01:20:30,303
Actually, it is too bad
you and I are on opposite sides.

938
01:20:30,605 --> 01:20:34,140
I admire your tenacity.
Under different circumstances...

939
01:20:34,275 --> 01:20:39,732
...I might have even allowed you to live,
perhaps as my, uh... valet, or butler.

940
01:20:40,864 --> 01:20:44,151
And what would you have me
become, Herr Field Marshal?

941
01:20:44,285 --> 01:20:46,077
- What?
- I said...

942
01:20:46,204 --> 01:20:50,367
...what position could I hold
in your "New Order"?

943
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:53,703
Juliet! What are you saying?
He's a Nazi! Don't beg a Nazi!

944
01:20:53,836 --> 01:20:56,410
<i>Would I be your... Reinemachefrau?</i>

945
01:20:56,547 --> 01:20:59,715
<i>Ja, you could, uh... you could be that.</i>

946
01:20:59,842 --> 01:21:02,760
- What is that? What is it?!
- Tell him.

947
01:21:02,888 --> 01:21:05,757
<i>- Reinemachefrau.
- Rrrreinemachefrau.</i>

948
01:21:07,475 --> 01:21:11,972
It means she could be
my... cleaning woman.

949
01:21:12,355 --> 01:21:14,562
Cleaning woman!

950
01:21:24,618 --> 01:21:26,859
All right, join your pals.
Let's go! Move it!

951
01:21:26,994 --> 01:21:30,364
Great work, Juliet.
Go find Carlos Rodriguez for me.

952
01:21:30,498 --> 01:21:31,827
All right.

953
01:21:31,957 --> 01:21:34,995
Your having that gun
won't stop us, Herr Reardon.

954
01:21:35,127 --> 01:21:38,745
We are a dedicated people,
willing to sacrifice ourselves!

955
01:21:38,882 --> 01:21:42,666
There are only six bullets
in that gun. There are nine of us.

956
01:21:42,801 --> 01:21:46,633
Thus at least three will survive
to throw those switches.

957
01:21:46,765 --> 01:21:49,766
OK. But who's going to win the lottery...

958
01:21:49,893 --> 01:21:52,465
...and who's going to lose?

959
01:21:54,731 --> 01:21:58,064
Cowards! Fools!

960
01:21:58,902 --> 01:22:00,940
I'll do it myself!

961
01:22:01,070 --> 01:22:02,730
Sorry, pal. You're through.

962
01:22:08,870 --> 01:22:11,538
Not... quite.

963
01:22:15,877 --> 01:22:17,916
At least... we got...

964
01:22:18,588 --> 01:22:22,799
...Terre Haute, India... na.

965
01:22:24,052 --> 01:22:27,338
Damn! They were just about
to get a public library.

966
01:22:28,139 --> 01:22:30,215
Carlos, lock these creeps up.

967
01:22:30,349 --> 01:22:32,259
With pleasure!

968
01:22:32,393 --> 01:22:35,727
<i>0K, creeps. Vámonos! Let's go!</i>

969
01:22:36,647 --> 01:22:38,806
<i>Schweinehunds! Pig dogs!</i>

970
01:22:39,276 --> 01:22:43,404
I pity the Devil the day
you boys start arriving in bunches.

971
01:22:47,033 --> 01:22:50,237
<i>Señor Reardon, when will</i>
you be leaving Carlotta?

972
01:22:51,121 --> 01:22:53,159
- Next plane out, Carlos.
- Aha!

973
01:22:53,290 --> 01:22:56,989
That gives me four hours
to wash and press your pyjamas.

974
01:22:57,626 --> 01:22:59,667
No, thanks, Carlos.

975
01:23:00,337 --> 01:23:03,008
I don't think I'll be
needing my pyjamas any more.

976
01:23:09,139 --> 01:23:11,381
What a guy!

977
01:23:24,653 --> 01:23:26,481
What are you... doing?

978
01:23:26,614 --> 01:23:28,524
Adjusting your willie.

979
01:23:28,658 --> 01:23:32,703
When you fell through the window,
it shifted out of whack.

980
01:23:32,829 --> 01:23:35,154
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

981
01:23:36,749 --> 01:23:40,450
<i>I hadn't had my willie
adjusted like that in a long time...</i>

982
01:23:41,129 --> 01:23:43,750
<i>...especially without having to beg.</i>

983
01:23:44,632 --> 01:23:47,206
<i>So there it was - the Carlotta mystery...</i>

984
01:23:47,343 --> 01:23:50,048
<i>...all wrapped up in a neat little bundle.</i>

985
01:23:50,513 --> 01:23:54,511
<i>As I stood there kissing Juliet, I thought
of nothing but hanging up my gun...</i>

986
01:23:54,643 --> 01:23:58,475
<i>...and spending the rest of my days
in that ivy-covered cottage.</i>

987
01:23:58,604 --> 01:24:01,605
<i>Little did I realise
that less than a year later...</i>

988
01:24:01,732 --> 01:24:04,817
<i>...she and I would have
an even more exciting adventure...</i>

989
01:24:04,945 --> 01:24:08,147
<i>...which is coming soon
to your neighbourhood theatre...</i>

990
01:24:08,281 --> 01:24:10,951
<i>...with a possible nude scene by Juliet.</i>
