1
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,590
<i>It was a quiet day at the</i>
<i>Rigby Reardon Detective Agency.</i>

2
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,271
<i>I had a hangover, and business was</i>
<i>so slow I was rereading old newspapers.</i>

3
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,756
<i>I was even thinking of closing up</i>
<i>the office for a few days...</i>

4
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,758
<i>...when all of a sudden...</i>

5
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,597
- Mr Reardon?
- That's right.

6
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,356
My...

7
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,630
...my name... my...

8
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,798
<i>In all my years in the business,</i>
<i>I'd never seen anything like her.</i>

9
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,194
<i>Was she real? There was</i>
<i>only one way to find out.</i>

10
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,150
<i>But I remembered Marlowe's words.</i>

11
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,355
What the hell does Marlowe know?

12
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,033
<i>She was real all right.</i>

13
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,834
What are you doing?

14
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,349
Adjusting your breasts.

15
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,314
You fainted and they...
shifted all outta whack.

16
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,389
- There.
- Thank you.

17
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,395
You're welcome.

18
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,230
Thank you. I... I apologise
for my dramatic entrance.

19
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,830
It's just when I saw
the... newspaper headlines...

20
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,353
- You must be quite a Dodgers fan.
- No, I saw... the <i>front</i> page.

21
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,718
- What's your name, Dollface?
- Juliet Forrest.

22
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,716
Forrest...

23
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,915
Daughter of the big cheesemaker.
You could use a cup of my famous java.

24
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,471
Cheese was Daddy's hobby.
He was a scientist.

25
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,597
- Quite an accident he had.
- That's what I came to see you about.

26
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,712
You don't think it was an accident.
You think he was murdered.

27
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,149
How did you know?

28
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,751
It's my business to know,
Miss Forrest. Sit down.

29
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,430
What makes you think
it wasn't an accident?

30
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,120
Just before it... it happened...

31
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,835
...he behaved very erratically, writing
out lists of names, dozens of them.

32
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,475
He wrote them on blotters
and scratch pads, whatever was handy.

33
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,433
Here's one of the lists... or part of one.

34
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,795
It's from a dollar bill.

35
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,992
Somehow I got the feeling he was
the victim of a giant conspiracy.

36
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,389
You deducted murder
and a giant conspiracy from <i>this?</i>

37
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,671
You think I'm too impulsive,
don't you, Mr Reardon?

38
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,950
Maybe.

39
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,630
Maybe not.

40
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,317
If you want me to investigate
your father's death, I get $10 a day.

41
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,749
Plus expenses.

42
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,912
Will $200 be enough
in advance, Mr Reardon?

43
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,350
- For $200 I'd shoot my grandmother.
- That won't be necessary.

44
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:26,349
You never can tell. 0n my last case, I
had to throw my brother out of a plane.

45
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,074
Where'd your father
keep his correspondence?

46
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,954
He had a small private office downtown.
Here's the key.

47
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,995
Thank you, Mr Reardon.
I appreciate this.

48
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,835
- Miss Forrest?
- Yes?

49
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,714
Save me some shoe leather if you
told me what address this key fits.

50
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,673
It was 429 Firehouse Row.

51
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,360
Pretty seedy part of town
for a renowned scientist.

52
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,278
It was the only place
he could experiment with cheese...

53
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,790
...without the smell
bothering the neighbours.

54
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,275
I'll see what I can turn up.

55
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,640
Good day, Mr Reardon.

56
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,913
<i>On my way to Firehouse Row,</i>
<i>I tried not to think of Juliet Forrest.</i>

57
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,712
<i>I hadn't seen a body like that...</i>

58
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,913
<i>... since I'd solved the case of</i>
<i>the murdered girl with the big tits.</i>

59
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,752
<i>I had no trouble finding</i>
<i>Dr Forrest's cheese lab.</i>

60
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,110
<i>It smelled like the number on the door.</i>

61
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,349
<i>Inside, I turned up</i>
<i>something interesting.</i>

62
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,476
"To John Forrest, a dear man who, like
his cheeses, gets stronger with age."

63
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,591
"Love, Kitty."

64
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,429
So the old renowned scientist
was getting a little on the side.

65
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,989
"Enemies of Carlotta."

66
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,829
"Friends of Carlotta."

67
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,236
"Kitty Collins"?

68
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,672
Sounds like company.

69
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,955
Exterminator.

70
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,270
Just a minute.

71
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,072
Come in.

72
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,150
Sit down.

73
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,508
There's some cookies on the table.

74
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,670
Have one.

75
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,270
Good, aren't they?

76
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,195
Guess to be a really good exterminator
you have to enjoy killing things.

77
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,639
Yeah.

78
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,597
- Yes?
- I'd like to see Miss Forrest.

79
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,073
- Who shall I say is calling?
- Mr Reardon. Tell her I've been shot.

80
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,792
Very good, sir.

81
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,151
- May I tell her by whom?
- No. I don't know myself.

82
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,673
Are you all right? You look
as though you're going to faint.

83
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,155
Faint? Ha!

84
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,916
Never.

85
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,350
- Catch me.
- Sorry.

86
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,360
I'm a butler... not a catcher.

87
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,873
Dollface...

88
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,550
What are you doing?!

89
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,035
It should feel better now.

90
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,358
- Where'd you learn <i>that?</i>
- At camp.

91
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,197
- You learned that at girls' camp?
- It's really for snakebite, but...

92
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,356
...I find it works for everything.

93
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,475
You mumbled about Kitty Collins
and Swede Anderson being on a list.

94
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,149
- "Friends of Carlotta"?
- That's right. Do you know them?

95
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,756
Kitty was...

96
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,352
...Kitty was someone Daddy
trifled with after Mother dried up.

97
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,835
And Swede was Kitty's boyfriend.

98
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,109
Where are they now?

99
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,429
The last I heard,
they were in Santa Barbara.

100
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,757
He used to be a boxer.
Now he works in a gas station...

101
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,916
...and she sings in a private club.

102
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,839
You may be interested in this.
I found it in Daddy's study.

103
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,353
"Thanks for the check.
In case I'm indisposed...

104
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,359
...the dollar you gave me for safekeeping
is in the top of the sugar bowl."

105
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,550
- "Shh."
- Why?

106
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,276
No. This.

107
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,271
No, no, no. That's not "Shh."
It's S-H-H. Samuel H Hastings.

108
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,709
My brother-in-law. 0r at least he was.

109
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,549
He and my sister Leona are separated.
He's a hopeless drunk.

110
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,955
- Where is he now?
- I don't know.

111
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,880
Get your sister Leona for me.

112
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,558
All right.

113
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,319
I'm afraid she may
not be very much help.

114
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,557
- She's very disturbed.
- How disturbed?

115
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,433
She's been diagnosed
as a paranoid hypochondriac.

116
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,030
- Doctors think she may be faking.
- I'll know after one word if she is.

117
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,072
- Hello?
- She's faking.

118
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,193
Mrs Hastings? My name's Reardon.
Sorry to hear your father's passed on.

119
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,914
No, he hasn't.
He won't be back till Sunday.

120
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,754
Sunday? You don't understand,
Mrs Hastings.

121
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,314
I'm investigating your father's death.

122
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,319
My father called me from Chicago
tonight. He never mentioned a word!

123
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,000
Maybe it slipped his mind.

124
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,192
Look, uh, your father
<i>is</i> dead, Mrs Hastings.

125
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,357
Your sister Juliet feels
his death wasn't an accident.

126
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,516
What are you talking about?

127
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,279
<i>I had a long talk with him</i>
<i>just a little while ago.</i>

128
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:26,076
<i>- He told me terrible things about you.</i>
- Listen, you phony fruitcake!

129
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,549
Sorry I called you a fruitcake.
I just don't have time to listen to...

130
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,035
All right, don't listen! Who cares?

131
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,112
Your sister has a lot to learn
about phone courtesy.

132
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,310
You got any idea
how I could locate Sam?

133
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,193
You might ask the bartenders
along 5th Street.

134
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,675
I'll call you if I turn up anything.

135
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:51,715
0h... If I'm not home, leave a message
with the butler or the cleaning woman.

136
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,875
Cleaning woman.

137
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,749
Cleaning woman.

138
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,510
Cleaning woman.

139
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,670
Cleaning woman! Cleaning woman!

140
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,229
Cleaning woman! Cleaning woman!

141
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,596
Cleaning woman! Cleaning woman!

142
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,511
Sorry.

143
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,269
Why did you do that?

144
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,074
When I was seven years old...

145
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,280
...my father ran off with the cleaning...

146
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,711
My mother died of a broken heart.

147
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,553
Now every time
someone says cleaning...

148
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,677
...I go berserk.
- 0h! You poor dear.

149
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,074
I don't blame you for strangling me.

150
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,389
I'll never say it again.

151
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,396
Thanks.

152
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,710
So long, Dollface.

153
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,237
<i>I legged it down 5th Street</i>
<i>looking for Samuel H Hastings.</i>

154
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,158
<i>It was a street of frustrated hopes</i>
<i>and broken dreams.</i>

155
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:41,354
<i>Everything was cheap, cut-rate.</i>
<i>Even the prostitutes were having a sale.</i>

156
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,270
<i>There was no problem finding Hastings.</i>
<i>He owed money to every bartender.</i>

157
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,678
<i>He was staying at the Hotel Ward on</i>
<i>5th Street. It used to be on 8th Street...</i>

158
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,191
<i>... but they took so many rubber cheques,</i>
<i>it bounced all the way across town.</i>

159
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,675
<i>I went to his room and knocked.</i>

160
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,511
- Hastings? Sam Hastings?
- Who is it?

161
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,950
My name is Reardon.
I... have a proposition for ya.

162
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,230
But not today. Does it have to be today?

163
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,794
- Yeah.
- Come on Monday.

164
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,679
- I got that money for ya.
- What money?

165
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,633
There's a dollar bill
hidden in your sugar bowl.

166
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,115
I'll give you five bucks for it.

167
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,196
- You could buy a lotta booze with that.
- Just a minute.

168
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,910
Look in the top.

169
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,279
It fits perfectly.
Most of the names are illegible...

170
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,790
...but I can work out
Kitty Collins and Swede Anderson.

171
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,796
But what does "F0C" mean?

172
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:11,755
It's a slang word. When a man and a
woman are in love, the man puts his...

173
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,235
No, no. Written here. F-0-C.

174
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,759
0h. Unless I miss my guess,
that stands for "Friends of Carlotta".

175
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,471
- I'm impressed.
- You think <i>that's</i> impressive...

176
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,797
<i>There I was, standing like a kid</i>
<i>doing corny tricks for her...</i>

177
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,071
<i>... driving miles out of my way</i>
<i>just to see her.</i>

178
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,236
<i>Why?</i>

179
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,355
What are you thinking, Mr Reardon?

180
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,157
So long, Dollface. I'll be
in Santa Barbara if you need me.

181
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,636
<i>I found out Kitty Collins</i>
<i>was working at the Brentwood Room.</i>

182
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,352
<i>The Brentwood Room.</i>

183
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,439
<i>Where rich women go to meet rich men</i>
<i>so they can have rich kids.</i>

184
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,671
Miss Collins?

185
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,713
<i>Kitty wouldn't give me any information</i>
<i>if she thought I was a private eye...</i>

186
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,239
Excuse me.

187
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,591
<i>... so I decided to act like</i>
<i>a big-shot movie producer.</i>

188
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,750
- My name's Reardon. I make movies.
- How wonderful of you.

189
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,715
- You like boxing pictures?
- I'm afraid I've never seen one.

190
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:36,312
I'm casting a big boxing picture at RK0.
I'm looking for a singer. You interested?

191
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,319
The idea of two men beating
each other to a pulp makes me ill.

192
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,748
Well, I'm also doing a religious picture.

193
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,952
<i>The Story of Saint... Betty.</i>

194
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,798
You know, the... nun who
taught the lepers how to sing.

195
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,915
- How wonderful of you.
- Thanks.

196
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,757
John Hay Forrest said
you were a friend of Carlotta's.

197
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,791
Will you excuse me?

198
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,196
<i>I must have hit a nerve.</i>
<i>She went white as a ghost.</i>

199
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,428
<i>The next day I tailed Kitty Collins</i>
<i>to a fancy restaurant.</i>

200
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,473
<i>Midway through the meal, she noticed</i>
<i>me and did a pretty strange thing.</i>

201
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,989
<i>She took off her brooch and ditched it.</i>

202
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,280
<i>I had a pretty good idea where.</i>

203
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,193
Hold it, pal. I'm from
the health department.

204
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,359
We have a report that your soup
has too much jewellery in it.

205
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,438
"E0C." Enemies of Carlotta.

206
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,349
<i>The only name on the list that</i>
<i>wasn't crossed out was Swede Anderson.</i>

207
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,155
<i>I decided to drop in on him</i>
<i>before they crossed him out too.</i>

208
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,350
<i>Swede wasn't living in luxury.</i>

209
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,155
<i>As a matter of fact, for a moment,</i>
<i>I thought he wasn't living at all.</i>

210
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,352
Swede?

211
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,198
Sorry, Swede. I thought
you'd been murdered.

212
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,630
Come on, wake up!

213
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,433
Come on, Swede.

214
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,234
You need a cup of my java.

215
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,470
You're up. Good. The java
will be ready in a minute.

216
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,633
This is never gonna heal.

217
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,991
Anyway, my guess is by now Kitty
Collins is a million miles from here.

218
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,596
Do you think Swede was killed by
the same man who murdered my father?

219
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,077
Hold it, Dollface. No one's proved
your father's been murdered...

220
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,677
...yet.

221
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,076
But you may be right about
this being a conspiracy.

222
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,909
It's big. Maybe too big
for me to handle alone.

223
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,596
Get me a cup of java, will ya?

224
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,637
- Yeah?
<i>- Hello, Marlowe?</i>

225
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,955
- 0h, hello, Bernie.
- No, it's me, Rigby.

226
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,035
<i>What's up?</i>

227
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,550
I'm on an important case. I need
your help. How soon can you get here?

228
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:20,673
- I haven't had breakfast.
- Breakfast? You're late for lunch, pal.

229
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,030
<i>- It's two o'clock.</i>
- Two o'clock?

230
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,993
Hustle on over here.
I'll make you a cup of my famous java.

231
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,590
- I'd rather buy my own.
- Suit yourself. See ya in a half-hour.

232
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,553
And Marlowe. Wear a tie, for God's sake.

233
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,276
What's that?

234
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,356
I found it in Daddy's desk.

235
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,233
It looks like a key to one of
those lockers at the train station.

236
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:50,035
Number's been filed off.
What's it say on that envelope?

237
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,110
"Most recent rat."

238
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,677
- Very clever.
- You understand what it means?

239
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,429
Just a hunch. You know the Chinese
have a different animal for every year?

240
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,552
- Yes.
- Unless I miss my guess...

241
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,638
...the most recent
Year of the Rat was 1936.

242
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,273
This is the key to locker number 1936.

243
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,313
- You're a very smart man.
- So was Abraham Lincoln.

244
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,796
Look what happened to him.
Smart can get you killed.

245
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,350
I hope not.

246
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,955
Sometimes I feel I would like to...

247
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,349
<i>You'd like to what? Kiss me?</i>

248
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,797
<i>Yeah, that would be nice.</i>

249
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,993
<i>It would give me a chance to tell her</i>
<i>I was starting to feel something for her.</i>

250
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,315
<i>Something warm and squishy.</i>

251
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:47,709
<i>But a man in my business can't</i>
<i>take on a wife, have a bunch of kids.</i>

252
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,312
- We wouldn't have to have kids.
- What?

253
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,670
Look, this is getting us nowhere.

254
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,358
But thanks anyway.

255
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,234
You'd better go now. Marlowe's
coming over here to talk.

256
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,395
If you need me, just call.

257
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,155
You know how to dial, don't you?

258
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:19,751
You just put your finger in the hole,
and make tiny little circles.

259
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,955
Come on in. It's open.

260
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,230
Hello, Marlowe.

261
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,158
Dammit. You didn't do what I told ya.

262
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,070
I hate that dumb way of wearing
your shirt buttoned with no tie.

263
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,589
Let me get you a tie.

264
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,835
Here. This one's blue,
but you can wear it with brown.

265
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,520
- You annoy me.
<i>- I annoy you?</i>

266
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,916
You come in here with no tie...
Are you drunk?

267
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,713
- How many have you had?
- 0ne martini.

268
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,354
- I knew I was gonna see you.
- Sit down.

269
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,108
Here's what I want you to do.

270
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,156
Here's a list of names I found in a
bowl of soup. Don't ask me to explain.

271
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,840
I think they're all dead.
I want you to check 'em out.

272
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,316
And Marlowe? Put this on
for me, huh? As a favour.

273
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,590
It's a clip-on.

274
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:38,232
<i>I put Marlowe to work checking Kitty's</i>
<i>list against recent unsolved murders...</i>

275
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,555
<i>... while I yellow-cabbed it</i>
<i>to the station...</i>

276
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,355
<i>... to see how Dr Forrest's key</i>
<i>would fit into the puzzle.</i>

277
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,677
<i>I sashayed over to locker number 1936.</i>

278
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,755
<i>The key fit like a glove.</i>
<i>As I opened the locker...</i>

279
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,316
<i>... I noticed a handsome guy</i>
<i>in a grey pinstripe watching me.</i>

280
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,433
<i>It seemed I wasn't the only one who was</i>
<i>interested in the contents of that locker.</i>

281
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,230
<i>Inside were two long lists of</i>
<i>Carlotta's friends and enemies.</i>

282
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,920
<i>The first name that jumped out</i>
<i>was FX Huberman...</i>

283
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,157
<i>... number 46 Bay Court Drive,</i>
<i>Grunion Point.</i>

284
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,113
<i>I decided to take a little train ride</i>
<i>and visit Mr Huberman.</i>

285
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,718
<i>I knew "Handsome" would follow me,</i>
<i>so to throw him off...</i>

286
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,389
<i>... I cleverly ducked into</i>
<i>the men's room and lost him.</i>

287
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,518
<i>There was no way he could follow me</i>
<i>unless I had toilet paper on my shoe.</i>

288
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,116
Damn!

289
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,793
<i>It wasn't really toilet paper,</i>
<i>it was a seat cover...</i>

290
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:43,469
<i>... but it was enough for</i>
<i>a smart guy to make the connection.</i>

291
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,317
<i>As soon as we went into a tunnel...</i>

292
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,991
<i>... Handsome popped in and started</i>
<i>looking for a match... in my pockets.</i>

293
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,550
Oh! Was that your leg?
- No, it was my face.

294
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,796
I had no idea we were
going into a tunnel.

295
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,070
I'm sure.

296
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,676
I thought the compartment was empty.

297
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,836
Yeah, right. Uh-huh, sure.

298
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,994
- I'm so sorry. I hope I didn't hurt you.
- It's all right.

299
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,269
To what do I owe
the pleasure of your company?

300
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,597
The man in the next compartment's
smoking a vile cigar.

301
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,871
I had to come in here.
You don't smoke, do you?

302
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,037
- No, I have tuberculosis.
- 0h, thank heavens for that.

303
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,118
After last night,
my head couldn't stand it.

304
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:36,796
<i>I didn't want him to know where I was</i>
<i>going so I decided to put him away fast.</i>

305
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,516
<i>I always carry my harmonica.</i>

306
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,394
<i>It's lighter than an accordion,</i>
<i>and more powerful than a sleeping pill.</i>

307
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:54,833
<i>I left him napping like a baby</i>
<i>when I ducked out at Grunion Point.</i>

308
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,797
Here's three bucks if you can get
this cab to 46 Bay Court in ten minutes.

309
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,275
Follow that cab!

310
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,511
<i>It was a pretty clever thing I did.</i>

311
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,191
<i>By taking the only two cabs, I made</i>
<i>sure Handsome couldn't follow me.</i>

312
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,118
<i>When I arrived at Mr Huberman's,</i>
<i>I was surprised.</i>

313
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,313
<i>Mr Huberman turned out to be</i>
<i>a sexy dame who was throwing a party.</i>

314
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,558
<i>She didn't even ask me what I wanted,</i>
<i>just made me feel real welcome.</i>

315
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,635
How about you, handsome?
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?

316
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,194
Maybe. I've been somewhere before.

317
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,349
It's nice of you to invite me.
I feel a little like a party crasher.

318
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,789
I like party crashers.

319
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,434
I like classy dames with bedroom eyes.

320
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,516
You know something? I like you.

321
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,437
I like me too.

322
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:00,917
When these people leave, maybe...
you and I can have a party of our own.

323
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,349
0h, I... I have to think that over.

324
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,148
<i>She was a fast thinker.</i>

325
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,998
I'm very sorry. You all have to go.
It has been a perfectly hideous party.

326
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,630
- Good night.
- Good night.

327
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,755
Stuffy in here, isn't it?

328
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,558
<i>Suddenly I realised</i>
<i>she'd slipped me a Mickey.</i>

329
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:47,151
<i>My lips felt like two manhole covers.</i>
<i>My tongue felt like it had hair on it.</i>

330
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,636
<i>My ears started to ring. I felt like a dog.</i>

331
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,838
Woof!

332
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,871
Woof, Huberman, woof!

333
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,560
Come on. Let's go out dancin'.

334
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,910
You put on your black dress,
and I'll go shave my tongue.

335
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,314
# Barbasol, Barbasol

336
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,716
# No brush, no lather, no rub-in

337
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,478
# Wet your razor then begin

338
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,876
# Barbasol, Barbasol

339
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,434
# 0ompah, oompah, oompah, oompah

340
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,518
Come on, FX. I'm ready!

341
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,110
Let's go dancing.

342
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,109
Hold it!

343
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,155
Sorry, Dollface.

344
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,989
- How did <i>you</i> get here?
- Your door was open, so I walked in.

345
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,475
- I've been trying to call you all night.
- How did <i>I get here?

346
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,876
- I guess you must have crawled.
- 0h, God!

347
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,514
- 0h, no, that's 0K.
- It's just a little alcohol.

348
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,517
- They don't hurt.
- Don't be a baby.

349
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,949
Get back!

350
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,875
What's up?

351
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,634
Sam Hastings is dead.

352
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,149
Poor rummy. How did he get it?

353
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:51,511
Fell out of a window
reaching for a bottle of whisky.

354
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,633
He could have been pushed. I'll have
Marlowe check his back for fingerprints.

355
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,194
- Anything else?
- Yes.

356
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,232
I found another note
Daddy wrote to himself.

357
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,112
"NYTAG-216."

358
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,993
I think it's a New York
licence plate number.

359
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,351
Not bad, Dollface.
Unless I'm... 0hh! Agh!

360
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,630
Careful. Let me get you some alcohol.

361
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,716
No!

362
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,553
It's not N-Y TAG. It's N-Y-T.

363
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,630
<i>New York Times.</i>

364
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,997
So what's "A-G"?

365
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,874
- Standard library talk for August.
- And 216?

366
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,829
Stands for the August 2nd issue,
page one, column six.

367
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,150
Extension 20, please.

368
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,670
Hi. It's me, Rigby.

369
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,677
Sorry, Hot Legs, I've been busy.

370
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,155
You sashay over to
your <i>New York Times</i> file...

371
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:55,193
...read me what's on page one,
column six of the August 2nd issue...

372
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,788
...maybe I'll wine and dine you
some night soon.

373
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,909
I'll wait.

374
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,349
You'd wine and dine her for information?

375
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,755
Her? Him.

376
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,440
Yeah... Then read me the whole article.

377
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,070
<i>"Immer Essen".</i>

378
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,155
Walter Neff's the owner.

379
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,475
Thanks, Hot Legs. I owe you a big one.

380
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,230
<i>Immer essen.</i>

381
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,508
<i>Immer essen.</i>
That means "always eating".

382
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,029
- What language?
- German.

383
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,399
It's also the name of
a South American cruise ship.

384
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:37,275
I know! When Sam Hastings
and my sister separated last July...

385
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,429
...he took a South American tour
on that ship.

386
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,596
Very interesting.

387
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,076
Right after that tour,
the company cancelled its cruises.

388
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,760
Now Sam Hastings is dead.

389
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:53,237
- I don't see the connection.
- I don't either. That's what bothers me.

390
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,670
Hello?

391
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,957
- Who is it?
- This is Marlowe.

392
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,830
0h, hello, Mr Marlowe.
Would you hold a moment, please?

393
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,035
- It's Marlowe.
- Good.

394
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,751
Hello, Marlowe. Listen, don't check out
those unsolved murders right now.

395
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,915
Yeah? Why not?

396
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:40,750
I got something more important. You
ever had any dealings with Walter Neff?

397
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,077
Walter Neff. He runs
a South American cruise-ship company.

398
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,798
Good. Tell me about him.

399
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,918
Cruises supermarkets
looking for blondes?

400
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,038
Good. I'll supply the blonde.

401
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,354
0ne other thing.

402
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:04,229
If Walter Neff leaves the country,
I may have to take a little boat ride.

403
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:09,150
If I do, stay off the booze. These
people we're dealing with are killers.

404
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,716
Well, thanks for telling <i>me.</i>
Have a nice trip.

405
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:16,150
I may not leave right away,
but thanks anyway. And Marlowe?

406
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,510
<i>- You wearin' a tie?</i>
- Goodbye.

407
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,914
- What was <i>that</i> all about?
- Marlowe knows Neff.

408
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,793
Says he's a pushover
for beautiful blondes.

409
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,195
It means we need a female spy.

410
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,071
Why not use me?

411
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,756
Sorry.

412
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,155
You're not blonde enough.

413
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,955
- I can always dye my hair.
- No dice, Dollface. You're a client.

414
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:06,949
That's one thing I've learned about
clients. Dead ones don't pay their bills.

415
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,115
Is that all you think of me?

416
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,515
Someone who pays you $10 a day?

417
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,910
That's right, Dollface.
To me you're just a meal ticket.

418
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,435
<i>How could I tell her that I was lying?</i>

419
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:33,394
<i>I'd work for nothing just to watch</i>
<i>her hair bounce as she walked...</i>

420
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,115
<i>... smell her creamy skin,</i>
<i>cradle her head on my shoulder.</i>

421
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,070
<i>Feel the slope of her waist,</i>
<i>the curve of her back...</i>

422
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,158
<i>... and then gently caress</i>
<i>her two beautiful...</i>

423
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,869
I'm sorry.

424
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,992
I just don't like
being called a meal ticket.

425
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:13,838
<i>As I started my search for a blonde spy,</i>
<i>I tried to get rid of the image of Juliet...</i>

426
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,714
<i>... storming out of my office</i>
<i>with toothpaste on her shoes.</i>

427
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:23,353
<i>First on my list was Monica Stillpond,</i>
<i>a bombshell who once told me...</i>

428
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:27,837
<i>... she would do anything</i>
<i>for anybody anywhere at any time.</i>

429
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,474
But muscle gave me
<i>my</i> start in politics.

430
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,797
It was when I was assistant
to old man Zimmerman, the plumber.

431
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,595
- Mr Madvig, you're joking.
- About the plumbing, or the muscle?

432
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,154
I just can't imagine you as a plumber.

433
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,870
<i>She was in the middle</i>
<i>of a fancy dinner party.</i>

434
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,879
<i>But I couldn't waste time being polite.</i>
<i>I caught her attention.</i>

435
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,589
Coffee will be served
in the living room, Mr Madvig.

436
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:01,754
<i>One thing about Monica: The words</i>
<i>"I can't" weren't in her vocabulary.</i>

437
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,269
Monica, I want you
to do something for me.

438
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,391
I can't.

439
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:10,149
<i>I guess she had added them</i>
<i>since the last time I'd seen her.</i>

440
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,950
<i>The next one on my list was</i>
<i>Doris Devermont, an old flame of mine.</i>

441
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:18,595
<i>With her I'd had the most honest</i>
<i>relationship I'd ever had with a woman.</i>

442
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:23,111
<i>The only thing I'd lied about was my</i>
<i>name. I'd told her I was Teddy Novak...</i>

443
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,596
<i>... so she couldn't track me down</i>
<i>if I got her pregnant.</i>

444
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,596
<i>Doris remembered me, naturally.</i>

445
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,597
How do you do, Mr Novak?

446
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:42,748
Mr Novak? No hugs, no kisses? We used
to flop into each other's arms, Doris.

447
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,759
Well, don't you think we really ought to
get to know each other all over again?

448
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,271
It's only been five years. You were about
to serve me dinner when I had to leave.

449
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,675
How stupid of me.
You must be famished.

450
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,634
I should have thought of it sooner.
I'll get some coffee and sandwiches.

451
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,189
<i>Coffee and sandwiches.</i>

452
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,357
<i>Now I remembered Doris's</i>
<i>famous stale-bread sandwiches.</i>

453
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,955
<i>She'd buy day-old bread, then toast it</i>
<i>to cover up. I wonder if she's changed.</i>

454
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,833
The bread's none too fresh.
Shall I toast it?

455
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,473
No, thanks.
I gave up stale toast for Lent.

456
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,388
- Lent?
- Nothing.

457
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,031
<i>Same old Doris.</i>

458
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,118
<i>She used to get smoked turkey</i>
<i>so it would keep for months.</i>

459
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,879
<i>When it finally went bad,</i>
<i>she'd feed it to the maid.</i>

460
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,788
I had some smoked turkey. I guess
the cleaning woman had it for her lunch.

461
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,070
0h, here's some pâté.

462
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,630
Cleaning woman.

463
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,350
Cleaning woman.

464
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,030
Cleaning woman!

465
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,437
Cleaning woman! Cleaning woman!

466
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,150
Cleaning woman! Cleaning woman!

467
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,395
Sorry.

468
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:16,110
<i>I was too embarrassed to ask Doris for</i>
<i>a favour after I'd tried to strangle her...</i>

469
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,550
<i>... so I went to the next name</i>
<i>in my little black book.</i>

470
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:24,276
<i>The blondest one on my list was a rich</i>
<i>society dame named Jimmi Sue Altfeld.</i>

471
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,996
<i>I almost hated to use her - she was so</i>
<i>in love with me, it nearly made me sick.</i>

472
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,429
<i>But business was more important.</i>

473
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,438
<i>I wined her and dined her</i>
<i>at the Plantation Club.</i>

474
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,710
<i>Then I made my move.</i>

475
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:42,277
Last time we saw each other, I left you
alone sitting at a counter at Schwab's.

476
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,112
- You don't hate me for that, do you?
- 0f course I don't.

477
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,078
Good...

478
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,760
I'd like to discuss something with you.

479
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,472
- Where to?
- Take me home.

480
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,717
<i>There was no way I was gonna</i>
<i>take her home. Her father hated me.</i>

481
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:02,958
<i>So I told her to meet me at a motel and</i>
<i>I'd show her something with my hands.</i>

482
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,310
Come in.

483
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,317
Well, Jimmi Sue, you ready?

484
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,509
What are we going to do?

485
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,595
Kinsey from cover to cover.

486
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:08,111
Has anyone ever told you that your lips
are like two succulent Brussels sprouts...

487
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,199
...waiting to be buttered and bitten?
- Plenty of men have.

488
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,230
Really?

489
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,118
Have these men ever told you...

490
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:22,916
...that your eyes are like Chinese coins
with dollops of caviar in the centre?

491
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,429
Can't you see how happy
you and I would be here?

492
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:29,838
Yes, I do. But I want you to come
back to the city with me first.

493
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:35,193
I'm working on an important case. It's
dangerous, and you'll probably be killed.

494
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:38,551
- But if you love me, you'll do it.
- Yes, I do love you.

495
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:43,959
And I love you. And I mean that more
than anything I've ever said in my life.

496
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:59,516
<i>I rented an apartment and started giving</i>
<i>Jimmi instructions on how to pump Neff.</i>

497
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,552
<i>She took direction</i>
<i>like a pig takes to garbage.</i>

498
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,671
Here's a picture of our Mr Neff.

499
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,360
Do, uh, whatever you have to...

500
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,074
...to find out what happened
on the <i>Immer Essen.</i>

501
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,636
Your father threatened to have me
beat up if I continue to see ya.

502
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,275
Thought I'd drop over there tomorrow
with a little peace offering.

503
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,676
What could I take that'd soften him up?

504
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,155
He never had a dog when he was a boy.

505
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,150
Never had a dog, huh?

506
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,597
Mr Altfeld?

507
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,595
Totally house-broken.

508
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,079
His name is... Ramon.

509
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,590
He's yours.

510
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,555
Get out, thief!

511
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:01,231
I'm not stealing your daughter. I'm just
borrowing her for an important case.

512
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:06,880
Don't go near my daughter. Don't try
to see her. Don't write and don't phone.

513
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,594
Can I use her underwear to make soup?

514
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,109
- Get out!
- Mr Altfeld...

515
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,198
...by helping me,
your daughter's life is in danger.

516
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,835
But she may save hundreds of lives.
You wouldn't stand in the way of that.

517
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,916
Why certainly I would!

518
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:25,557
I'd frame you or kill you...
if it would protect my daughter.

519
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:30,433
And I brought you a puppy,
something you never had as a boy.

520
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,710
Now get out!

521
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,675
Come on, Ramon.

522
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,871
You don't deserve a puppy.

523
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,358
Wait!

524
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,710
Pick that up.

525
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:51,112
- But it's all soft and steamy.
- Pick that up!

526
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,395
You're a sick man, Altfeld.

527
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:08,191
You can make me pick up dog dirt,
but you can't stop me seeing Jimmi Sue.

528
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,155
- You want a puppy?
- I'd love a dog.

529
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,792
Thank you.

530
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,992
- Here's something for you, too.
- 0h, thank you.

531
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,035
Eugh!

532
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,749
Well, Larry, Moe and Curly.

533
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,395
Thanks, Dan.

534
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:43,318
Not a nice way to treat
a friend of Mr Altfeld's daughter.

535
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,510
There's only one way to treat <i>you.</i>

536
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,835
You got some
pretty smart monkeys here.

537
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,556
I notice this one's wearing
a Phi Beta Kappa key here.

538
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,756
- 0w!
- Your move.

539
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:06,314
I'm gonna have some sense
beaten into you.

540
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:11,272
What's he payin' you boys? I'll double it
and we'll beat the shit outta him.

541
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,550
All right, Dan.

542
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,476
Rigby?

543
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,836
Rigby?

544
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,596
Rigby?

545
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,757
Juliet!

546
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,350
Those dirty bastards!
Beating up a woman.

547
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,799
They even knocked
your breasts out of whack.

548
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,636
Rigby?

549
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,000
Juliet... Are you all right?

550
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,038
0h!

551
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,116
Yes, I'm fine.

552
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,358
- You look awful.
- It's all in a day's work.

553
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,198
No, Rigby. It's not worth it.

554
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,077
- I want you to quit.
- Why? Because I've been roughed up?

555
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,794
You've also been shot and drugged...

556
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,398
...and probably had to go to bed
with women you didn't know.

557
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,876
You're just upset
about me interviewing blondes.

558
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,230
You can forget about it.

559
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,758
I've decided to get
the information myself.

560
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,676
How?

561
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,829
By disguising myself
as a beautiful blonde.

562
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,638
- Do I look like a dame?
- Not as much as I do.

563
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:10,073
- I haven't turned on the charm yet.
- Rigby, I wish you'd let me go instead.

564
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,998
Have Neff try and feel you up?
No chance, Dollface.

565
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,759
0h. You don't want
Mr Neff to feel me up?

566
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:19,111
That doesn't mean you're beginning
to... care for me, does it?

567
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,959
I don't want
any of my clients felt up.

568
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:27,268
I'm late. Neff cruises supermarkets
every Thursday looking for blondes.

569
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,755
If I'm half the woman I think I am...

570
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,440
...I'll have a date with Neff by tonight.

571
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,635
Good luck.

572
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,995
<i>Neff's favourite hunting ground</i>
<i>was Jerry's Market on Melrose.</i>

573
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,795
<i>I spotted him right away and</i>
<i>sidled down the aisle opposite him.</i>

574
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,992
<i>I was wearing a special perfume</i>
<i>called "Fondle Me".</i>

575
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:50,795
<i>Its aroma drew Neff to me</i>
<i>like fat to a mother-in-law.</i>

576
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,913
<i>He was a ladies' man, all right.</i>
<i>He made me feel beautiful, alive.</i>

577
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,156
<i>He asked me up to his place,</i>
<i>and I didn't play hard to get.</i>

578
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,430
All right.

579
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:10,072
<i>On his home ground, Neff was</i>
<i>more aggressive and I played along.</i>

580
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:17,317
- I'm crazy about you, baby.
- I'm crazy about you too, Walter.

581
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,590
That perfume. What's the name of it?

582
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,438
"Fondle Me".

583
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,516
Silly!

584
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,230
That's the name of the perfume.

585
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,431
- I feel like a drink.
- All I've got is bourbon.

586
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:33,070
I'll make the drinks.

587
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,710
Sit over there.

588
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:55,750
<i>I wanted to knock him out fast. I slipped</i>
<i>him 15 milligrams of Aphrodisiamil...</i>

589
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:59,793
<i>... and hoped it would take effect</i>
<i>before he tried to pick my lock.</i>

590
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:17,672
Sorry, Walter. That's as far
as I go on a first date.

591
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:01,796
<i>I didn't know what I was looking for,</i>
<i>but what I found was dynamite.</i>

592
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,469
<i>The passenger list of</i>
<i>the Immer Essen's final cruise.</i>

593
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:09,395
<i>It was the same as</i>
<i>the Carlotta "Enemies" list.</i>

594
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:15,108
<i>One name rang a bell. Cody Jarrett,</i>
<i>captain of the Immer Essen.</i>

595
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:20,189
<i>I went to the public library and looked</i>
<i>up everything I could on Captain Jarrett.</i>

596
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:24,279
"Framed Because He Knew Too Much."

597
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,393
"But He Refuses to Divulge What
He Knew to Anyone but His Mother."

598
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:33,108
<i>I hoped to find out why the passengers</i>
<i>on the Immer Essen's final cruise...</i>

599
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,595
<i>... were being knocked off one by one.</i>

600
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,837
<i>They all must have</i>
<i>seen something. But what?</i>

601
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,349
What do you think?

602
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:44,119
I think you enjoy
dressing up as a woman.

603
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,152
Jarrett's mother's
the only visitor he'll talk to.

604
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:51,239
And I think I look enough like her
to get a gift on Mother's Day.

605
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,196
Rigby, wait!

606
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,635
Don't... don't call me Rigby.

607
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,675
I'm worried.
Since you were beaten up...

608
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:15,998
...I've had nightmares about
something awful happening to you.

609
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,475
I care about you, Rigby.

610
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,510
What?

611
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,790
I care about you.

612
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,030
What's the matter?

613
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,469
You. You're the matter.

614
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:36,112
Did... did I... do something wrong?

615
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:39,757
Yeah. You crept into my gut.

616
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:43,714
You've got me thinking silly thoughts,
like... hanging up my gun for good.

617
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:46,354
Becoming a one-woman guy.

618
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,631
Settling down in
an ivy-covered cottage...

619
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,796
...raking leaves out of the backyard...

620
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,309
...squeezing orange juice
for you in the morning.

621
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:56,476
You'd do that for me?

622
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,435
- Yeah, I would.
- 0h, Rigby.

623
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,790
Cody Jarrett's mother.

624
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,751
Hello, Ma.

625
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:52,199
My name is Reardon.
I have important news for you.

626
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,515
So just pretend I'm your ma, 0K?

627
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:58,872
The paper said you were hit in the head
by a flying wrench in the machine shop.

628
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,912
Friends of Carlotta are
after you because you know too much.

629
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:05,430
- I see what you mean.
- So the flying wrench was no accident.

630
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,391
For a minute I thought it was.

631
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:10,353
Something like that
may happen again, so...

632
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:13,549
The guard looks suspicious.
Act like I'm your ma.

633
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,638
- Sure.
- Pretend I'm crying. You comfort me.

634
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,158
Relax, Ma.

635
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,871
Say something like, uh,
"No, no, Ma. Look, listen to me."

636
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,639
No, no, Ma. Look, listen to me.

637
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,234
That was good. Real good.

638
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:37,639
Look, as long as the other
prisoners can get to you...

639
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,354
...you're not safe.
But don't worry, I have a plan.

640
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,914
<i>I contacted Warden Dudley,</i>
<i>who owed me a favour.</i>

641
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:46,999
<i>I asked him to let me pose as a prisoner</i>
<i>so I could keep an eye on Jarrett...</i>

642
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:49,236
<i>... maybe learn something about Carlotta.</i>

643
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:52,909
<i>I learned fast. Jarrett had</i>
<i>a prison break planned that very night.</i>

644
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:57,431
<i>I was invited along... at gunpoint.</i>
<i>When they stuffed me in the trunk...</i>

645
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:01,155
<i>... I realised he was a friend</i>
<i>of Carlotta, and I was their enemy.</i>

646
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:05,556
Ryley, you get in the front.
And you, you drive.

647
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,308
<i>I bounced along in that trunk</i>
<i>a long time.</i>

648
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:14,468
<i>Five hours later, I had given up hope of</i>
<i>ever going to a regular bathroom again.</i>

649
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:17,673
<i>I decided to have a little chat</i>
<i>with Captain Jarrett.</i>

650
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,155
Hey, Cody!

651
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,800
- How ya doin', partner?
- I can't breathe.

652
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,876
0h. Stuffy, huh?

653
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:32,395
- I'll give you a little air.
- Thanks.

654
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,676
<i>Her lips were warm, and my arm wasn't</i>
<i>the only thing that was throbbing.</i>

655
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:47,030
<i>Our hearts were, too.</i>

656
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:50,357
<i>My plan was to kiss her</i>
<i>with every lip on my face...</i>

657
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,232
<i>... then slowly move her to the next room,</i>
<i>manoeuvre her next to the bed...</i>

658
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,838
<i>... marry her, and start</i>
<i>the whoopee machine.</i>

659
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,676
<i>My plan was working fine until...</i>

660
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:04,758
Agh! You stuck your finger
in my bullet hole.

661
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,235
- Sorry, Rigby.
- I'll be all right.

662
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,071
Why don't you lie down?

663
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:14,954
I'll go to the drugstore
and get you something for your arm.

664
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,200
It's raining too hard.
Call a cab. Hurry back.

665
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:21,515
I feel like kissing somebody.

666
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:23,949
Don't start without me.

667
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,958
Hello?

668
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,672
<i>- It's me, Margaret.</i>
- Who?

669
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,518
<i>- Margaret.</i>
- Margaret?

670
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:40,108
<i>Margaret Croyden.</i>

671
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:43,038
Margaret Croyden? I don't believe it!

672
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:46,992
- I don't believe you'd call me.
- I'd have called sooner...

673
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,475
- You shouldn't call at all.
- It's so quiet here.

674
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:52,433
0h, Victor's gone
for the weekend, huh?

675
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,869
Sorry. Not interested.

676
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:00,629
Because I'm in love. Yeah, really in love.

677
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,353
A few days ago I said something
to a woman I thought I'd never say.

678
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:11,793
I actually said "I want to settle down
in an ivy-covered cottage with you...

679
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,309
<i>... rake leaves out of the backyard...</i>

680
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:17,512
<i>... squeeze orange juice</i>
<i>for you in the morning. "

681
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:20,632
<i> I spoke to Victor.</i>
<i>He'll give me the divorce.</i>

682
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:24,150
<i>I'll tell you what. Come down</i>
<i>tomorrow. We'll drive back together.</i>

683
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:29,070
<i> Wonderful! I can't wait to</i>
<i>come bouncing back into your life again.</i>

684
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:35,074
No dice, Margaret.
Call me in another 12 years.

685
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,350
All right, darling.

686
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,231
- Hello?
<i>- Mr Reardon...</i>

687
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:17,193
<i>... I have decided to close this case</i>
<i>as of this moment.</i>

688
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:20,551
A cheque will be in the mail
for you tomorrow.

689
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:24,275
Please do not try to contact me
as I will be out of town for some time.

690
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:27,513
Juliet, has someone
got a gun to your head?

691
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,719
Juliet!

692
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,830
<i>A half-bottle of bourbon later</i>
<i>I still couldn't believe it.</i>

693
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:38,076
<i>Was Juliet crazy like her sister?</i>

694
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:42,432
<i>Had she fallen in love with the cab</i>
<i>driver on the way to the drugstore?</i>

695
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:46,473
<i>Or was she a member of the Carlotta</i>
<i>conspiracy and had set me up?</i>

696
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:49,831
<i>Finally, I arrived at</i>
<i>a very important conclusion.</i>

697
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,630
Shit on her!

698
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,355
All dames are alike.

699
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:12,196
They reach down your throat,
grab your heart... and pull it out.

700
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:16,791
They throw it on the floor... and
they step on it with their high heels.

701
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:21,399
They spit on it, shove it in the oven,
then cook the shit out of it.

702
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:25,957
They slice it into little pieces,
slam it on a hunk of toast...

703
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:28,435
...and they serve it to ya.

704
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:32,109
They expect you to say
"Thanks, honey, it's delicious."

705
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:37,952
Well, it's not delicious, Juliet Forrest.

706
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:40,230
It's rotten.

707
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:43,188
I don't give a damn
if I ever hear from you again.

708
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,792
- Juliet?
- This is Alan.

709
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:52,956
Alan?

710
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:57,354
- Come on, Marlowe, no games.
- I never could fool you, could I?

711
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,711
No.

712
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:02,671
Listen, Marlowe.

713
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:05,355
Juliet left me, and...

714
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:09,119
...I feel like I've been hit
with a wet frying pan.

715
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:11,231
How the hell do you pick up the pieces?

716
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:15,148
I'm beginning to realise it's better
to have something to look forward to.

717
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:18,113
"Look forward to." Like what? Work?

718
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,071
I can't get a break on this case.

719
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,714
I don't even know who the hell
this Carlotta dame is.

720
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:25,195
<i>Can you get a map of South America?</i>

721
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:27,788
- Yeah. You got something?
- Look up Peru.

722
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:32,870
Got it!

723
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,753
There's a little town
on the coast called Paita.

724
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:38,189
<i>Tell me where it is.</i>

725
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:43,158
It's right next to
a tiny little island called...

726
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:46,352
You son of a gun! Carlotta!

727
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,715
Damn! It's not a woman's name.

728
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,909
It's a place.

729
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:55,554
- Thanks, Marlowe. I owe ya.
- Good.

730
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:58,558
I'm leaving for Carlotta right now.

731
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:01,877
Even if Juliet's gone,
I'm gonna solve this case...

732
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,913
...no matter how many killers are
involved, even if Juliet's one of 'em.

733
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:08,600
Any idea where in Carlotta
I should start looking?

734
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:11,234
<i>There's a little café right on the bay.</i>

735
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:17,475
<i>When I arrived, I thought of the words</i>
<i>Marlowe had said to me 15 years ago:</i>

736
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:20,670
<i>"Dead men don't wear plaid."</i>

737
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:25,310
<i>Dead men don't wear plaid.</i>

738
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:29,114
<i>I still don't know what it means.</i>

739
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:34,073
<i>Carlotta was the kind of town where</i>
<i>they spell trouble t-r-u-b-i-l...</i>

740
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:37,351
<i>... and if you try to</i>
<i>correct them, they kill you.</i>

741
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,671
<i>I knew Marlowe had steered me right.</i>

742
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:57,475
<i>There was Kitty Collins, the girl</i>
<i>who ditched me in Santa Barbara.</i>

743
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,910
Señor Reardon.

744
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:09,110
Manuel Alesandro.

745
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,231
Not quite.

746
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:16,237
Carlos Rodriguez.

747
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,391
- Carlos Rodriguez?
<i>- Sí.</i>

748
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:24,958
Before the war...
we ran guns to the rebels.

749
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:28,312
0h, yeah.

750
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:30,751
You're a cop.

751
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,711
<i>Sí, sí, sí.</i>

752
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:35,070
I have joined the establishment.

753
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:41,230
That's good, Carlos. I'm here on an
investigation. Maybe you can help me.

754
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:43,794
There is much to investigate in Carlotta.

755
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:47,154
The whole island is like a powder keg.

756
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:51,319
There is much tension, the...
the smell of something rotten.

757
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:56,234
That's what I'm here for.
To find out what it is that smells.

758
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:57,873
Psst!

759
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,198
Be careful of the, uh,
fat one who sweats a lot.

760
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:05,959
What about Kitty Collins?

761
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:09,277
She doesn't sweat as much,
but she's just as dangerous.

762
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,675
# What you want

763
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:13,756
# Everybody wants

764
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,275
They say she is one of them.

765
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:23,349
Who is..."them"?

766
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,356
Nobody knows.
0nly they know who is "them".

767
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:31,795
But there is a man.
His name is <i>Arroz.</i> Rice.

768
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,789
Kitty Collins is in love with him.

769
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,750
He is a killer.

770
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:41,075
Rice, huh?

771
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:44,229
- Thanks, Carlos.
<i>- De nada, señor.</i>

772
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:49,192
- Where are you staying?
- Hotel Guano.

773
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:52,039
Ha! I'll be in touch.

774
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,515
<i>Cuidado,</i> Señor Reardon.

775
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:58,076
<i>Cuidado,</i> Carlos... <i>Cuidado.</i>

776
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:01,510
<i>I wanted Kitty Collins</i>
<i>to tell "them" I was in town...</i>

777
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:04,837
<i>... so I tossed a five-pesetaria coin</i>
<i>into the bowl.</i>

778
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:07,958
<i>The clank was loud enough</i>
<i>to make her look my way.</i>

779
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:12,273
<i>That five-pesetaria coin was</i>
<i>the best investment I ever made.</i>

780
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:17,349
<i>The next day, I hooked a big fish:</i>
<i>A fat one who sweats a lot.</i>

781
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:23,355
<i>- Señor?</i>
- Nothing alcoholic. 0h, a beer, maybe.

782
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,392
<i>Sí, señor.</i>

783
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:28,595
Hard liquor goes to my feet.

784
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:34,118
Just a minute, Mr Rigby.

785
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:37,394
We know who you are, Mr Rigby.

786
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:39,397
I'm interested. Who am I?

787
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:42,671
You could be a guy
who collects $10,000...

788
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:45,390
...just to leave this stinkin' town.

789
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:48,080
- I could, could I?
- You know who I could be?

790
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:52,156
Hunchback of Notre Dame?

791
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:56,592
I could be the guy
who hands ya... them $10,000.

792
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:00,950
$10,000. Me to you... just like that.

793
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:05,153
Sorry. My price for leaving
stinking towns is 11,500...

794
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,953
...and a kiss on the lips
from Carmen Miranda.

795
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:11,789
Pass it on to "them". Room 204.

796
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:14,598
Room 204, señora.

797
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:26,072
Come in.

798
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:30,718
Right on time, Kitty. Been expecting ya.

799
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:32,990
Thought you'd come last night.

800
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:36,112
- I wasn't thinking too well last night.
- Keep talking.

801
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:38,959
You see, I just
found out something, Rigby.

802
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:43,634
Who you are, what you do,
and why you're in Carlotta.

803
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:46,115
I'm here to bust up your game.

804
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:53,670
I don't get it. A class girl like you
in love with a killer like Rice.

805
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:56,314
Who... what... why?

806
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,396
When you love someone...

807
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:02,593
...I guess it doesn't make
any difference who, what or why.

808
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:05,075
You go right on loving them.

809
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:09,270
Yeah, you do, don't ya?

810
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:12,475
I feel as if...

811
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:19,633
Make me another drink, will you, baby?

812
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:26,037
Hello?

813
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:28,549
- What's up, <i>amigo?</i>
- Plenty.

814
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:32,397
A plane arrived today, and
all the passengers spoke German.

815
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:35,830
- German?
<i>- Mm-hm. Our friend Rice was there.</i>

816
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:38,918
They gave him a packet.
It was marked today's date...

817
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:41,474
...and "Final Instructions".
- How do you know?

818
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:46,310
I was hired to protect Rice until he
gets on that plane with Kitty Collins...

819
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:48,908
<i>... tonight after the Carlotta Festival.</i>

820
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:51,672
Why are you telling <i>me</i> this?

821
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:54,633
Because the lives of
millions of innocent p...

822
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:57,035
Carlos? Carlos!

823
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:00,076
Carlos!

824
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,156
Damn.

825
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:11,189
Where are you and Rice headed tonight?

826
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:14,313
What do you know about
a plane with Germermans on it?

827
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:16,396
Germerm... Germans.

828
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:19,196
Germermans.

829
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:23,351
There's a plane with mermans on it.

830
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,350
The plane's in town.

831
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,750
Ethel Merman came in on it.

832
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,994
Wanna go see Ethel Merman with me?

833
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:42,630
I'll buy two tickets.

834
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:45,957
Let me get on my pyjamas,
I'll be ready to go.

835
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,670
<i>I'd done some brilliant things</i>
<i>in my time.</i>

836
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:53,554
<i>Asking Kitty Collins to mix me</i>
<i>a drink wasn't one of them.</i>

837
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:59,073
<i>When I came to, I could make out</i>
<i>only light and shadow at first.</i>

838
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:02,351
<i>Then I saw an unfamiliar face.</i>
<i>But even in my stupor...</i>

839
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:06,473
<i>... I knew he was one of the big fish</i>
<i>in the conspiracy: Rice!</i>

840
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,795
Well, I believe
that about winds things up.

841
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:12,795
- I'm gonna wind <i>you</i> up on a rope.
- But you're the one who's gonna die.

842
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:17,630
Better make it look good. If anything
fishy happens to me, the FBI...

843
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,239
It'll look very natural.

844
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:23,353
People who know Rigby Reardon
know I'd never die a natural death.

845
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:27,436
Do you think
I'd leave you around to talk?!

846
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:29,676
You've already talked too much!

847
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,631
Hold it, Rice!

848
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:42,351
You're not getting on that plane
tonight. I want those papers.

849
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:45,438
I'm gonna walk out of this room.
You won't shoot.

850
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:47,710
I won't?

851
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:52,958
That was a warning shot, Rice. And I
don't fire as many of 'em as I used to.

852
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:07,876
Rigby! Señor!

853
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,956
- I heard shots.
- I'm all right.

854
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,275
- Rice went that way.
- Come on, Carlos!

855
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:16,075
Are you wearing pyjamas?
Señor, I'll help you take them off.

856
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:20,234
I don't need help
with my pyjamas! Stop!

857
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:22,157
<i>- Sí.</i>
- Carlos!

858
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:26,558
<i>Sí.</i> Don't worry about your pyjamas,
señor. I'll take care of them.

859
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:29,717
0ut of the way!
We are chasing a killer!

860
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:32,195
Everybody stand back! He's with me.

861
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:36,196
Coming through!

862
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,592
<i>Señor!</i>

863
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:41,676
<i>Cuidado, señor. Cuidado!</i>

864
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:45,440
- Stand back!
<i>- Cuidado!</i>

865
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,070
Señor! Your pyjamas!

866
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,668
Forget the pyjamas!

867
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:56,751
- Are you all right?
- It's just a bullet.

868
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:00,236
My wife Carmelita
will suck it out. Go ahead, señor.

869
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:04,999
And don't worry about your pyjamas.
I'll take care of them!

870
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:53,390
"Final Instructions".

871
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:01,874
So that's their game.

872
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:12,630
"Rasmussen Place".

873
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:36,633
<i>The last thing I expected to see</i>
<i>was Juliet and her father, alive...</i>

874
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:40,594
<i>... talking with their butler,</i>
<i>who was dressed in a Nazi uniform.</i>

875
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:43,154
<i>Yeah. That explained a lot.</i>

876
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:46,556
<i>Why Juliet was able</i>
<i>to translate German, for one thing.</i>

877
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:48,875
<i>I'd been played for a sucker.</i>

878
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,958
<i>But it wasn't too late</i>
<i>to set things straight.</i>

879
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,797
Yaaah!

880
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:03,793
0K, hands in the air.
0ver on the steps. Let's go!

881
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:07,595
It's time for a class picture.
Tall ones in back, short ones in front.

882
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:10,235
Now sit! Hold hands.

883
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:13,550
Now smile.

884
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,353
- That's nice.
- Rigby...

885
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:18,631
Hold it! Stay where you are,
you dirty, lying Nazi scum.

886
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:19,988
Rigby!

887
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:23,237
I should have known. I fell for
a dame who played me for a sucker.

888
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:25,794
No, Mr Reardon. She did not
play you for a sucker.

889
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:31,631
<i>I did. Pretending to be a butler, waiting
on inferior races was galling to me.

890
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:35,639
- But I fooled everyone.
- You see, Rigby? I didn't betray you.

891
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:38,672
- How did you know to come here?
- Marlowe told me.

892
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,758
That's how I found Daddy.
I smelled his cheese moulds.

893
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:44,155
I am sorry to interrupt
such a tender scene...

894
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:46,635
...but we have a plan to carry out now.

895
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,913
- Who are you really, kraut?
- Field Marshal Wilfred von Kluck.

896
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,315
- At your service.
- Von Kluck?

897
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:56,238
Former chief of Hitler's
Special Secret Weapons Corps.

898
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:58,794
I'm flattered. How did you know?

899
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:01,275
I figured out
your whole stinking scheme.

900
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:05,154
How you duped Dr Forrest into helping
you. How you flew in your agents!

901
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:08,033
The finest officers in the Führer's army.

902
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:11,990
- Former army.
- For the moment.

903
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:13,951
But we shall rise again.

904
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,992
- We'll see about that.
- How did they use Daddy?

905
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:20,715
Bullet-head here found out your father
had developed a cheese mould...

906
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:24,230
...so powerful it could decompose
rocks, trees and mountains.

907
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:27,432
He devised a plan to dissolve
the entire United States.

908
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:30,711
At first your father gave
this swine information because...

909
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:34,355
Please, Mr Reardon.
Allow <i>me</i> to tell the story.

910
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,950
- Your father went along...
- Mr Reardon.

911
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:41,392
It is customary in these situations for
the developer of the plan to describe it.

912
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:46,389
I beg your pardon. It's customary for the
private eye to tell how he figured it out.

913
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:48,272
No, it is my right!

914
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:52,029
We were able to dupe Dr Forrest by
posing as a humanitarian organisation...

915
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:55,277
...who planned to wipe out hunger
by ageing cheese faster.

916
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:59,359
- When he saw what they were doing...
- He assembled lists of our agents...

917
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:04,110
- And seemed about to go to the FBI...
- We had to drug him and bring him...

918
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:07,198
Here, faking his death
so there'd be no investigation...

919
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:10,232
But while testing the mould
on a small island nearby...

920
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:14,239
The <i>Immer Essen</i> passed by. Some of
the passengers saw the island dissolve...

921
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:16,920
They were therefore labelled "enemies".

922
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:19,395
We had Neff cancel
all further tours, and our...

923
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:23,559
...friends systematically began to
eliminate everyone on that cruise ship!

924
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:26,035
<i>- Schweinehund!</i>
- Jerk!

925
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,232
Now...

926
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:34,112
...we are ready.
0ur agents have just returned...

927
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:37,038
...after planting cheese bombs
throughout America.

928
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:40,470
With America destroyed,
we will win the next war.

929
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:42,238
And the one after that, too!

930
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:46,512
When these switches are thrown, your
meddling country will disintegrate...

931
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:48,551
...like a mouldy hunk of Liederkranz!

932
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:51,831
Hold the mould, Kluck. Those switches
aren't going to be thrown.

933
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:55,589
<i>Und</i> I think they will be.

934
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:57,676
<i>Halt ihn!</i>

935
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:03,798
Good... good.

936
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:08,636
I'm sorry to prevent
your becoming a hero, Herr Reardon.

937
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:12,070
Actually, it is too bad
you and I are on opposite sides.

938
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:15,750
I admire your tenacity.
Under different circumstances...

939
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:21,113
...I might have even allowed you to live,
perhaps as my, uh... valet, or butler.

940
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:25,351
And what would you have me
become, Herr Field Marshal?

941
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:27,198
- What?
- I said...

942
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:31,313
...what position could <i>I hold
in your "New 0rder"?

943
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:34,512
Juliet! What are you saying?
He's a Nazi! Don't beg a Nazi!

944
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:37,108
Would I be your... <i>Reinemachefrau?</i>

945
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:40,277
<i>Ja,</i> you could, uh... you could be that.

946
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:43,198
- What is that? What is it?!
- Tell him.

947
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:46,073
<i>- Reinemachefrau.</i>
<i>- Rrrreinemachefrau.</i>

948
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:52,032
It means she could be
my... cleaning woman.

949
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:54,516
Cleaning woman!

950
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:06,310
All right, join your pals.
Let's go! Move it!

951
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:09,671
Great work, Juliet.
Go find Carlos Rodriguez for me.

952
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:11,074
All right.

953
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:14,112
Your having that gun
won't stop us, Herr Reardon.

954
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:17,710
We are a dedicated people,
willing to sacrifice ourselves!

955
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:21,469
There are only six bullets
in that gun. There are nine of us.

956
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:25,275
Thus at least three will survive
to throw those switches.

957
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:28,278
0K. But who's going to win the lottery...

958
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:30,868
...and who's going to lose?

959
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:36,237
Cowards! Fools!

960
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:38,996
I'll do it myself!

961
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:40,712
Sorry, pal. You're through.

962
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:49,160
Not... quite.

963
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:55,276
At least... we got...

964
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:59,959
...Terre Haute, India... na.

965
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:04,311
Damn! They were just about
to get a public library.

966
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:07,071
Carlos, lock these creeps up.

967
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:09,031
With pleasure!

968
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:12,357
0K, creeps. <i>¡Vámonos!</i> Let's go!

969
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:15,310
<i>Schweinehunds!</i> Pig dogs!

970
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:19,719
I pity the Devil the day
you boys start arriving in bunches.

971
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:26,272
Señor Reardon, when will
you be leaving Carlotta?

972
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:29,076
- Next plane out, Carlos.
- Aha!

973
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:32,749
That gives me four hours
to wash and press your pyjamas.

974
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,316
No, thanks, Carlos.

975
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:38,520
I don't think I'll be
needing my pyjamas any more.

976
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,550
What a guy!

977
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:01,032
What are you... doing?

978
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:02,991
Adjusting your willie.

979
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:06,999
When you fell through the window,
it shifted out of whack.

980
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:09,350
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

981
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:14,429
<i>I hadn't had my willie</i>
<i>adjusted like that in a long time...</i>

982
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:17,594
<i>... especially without having to beg.</i>

983
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:20,908
<i>So there it was - the Carlotta mystery...</i>

984
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,634
<i>... all wrapped up in a neat little bundle.</i>

985
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:27,914
<i>As I stood there kissing Juliet, I thought</i>
<i>of nothing but hanging up my gun...</i>

986
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:31,715
<i>... and spending the rest of my days</i>
<i>in that ivy-covered cottage.</i>

987
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:34,718
<i>Little did I realise</i>
<i>that less than a year later...</i>

988
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:37,798
<i>... she and I would have</i>
<i>an even more exciting adventure...</i>

989
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:40,992
<i>... which is coming soon</i>
<i>to your neighbourhood theatre...</i>

990
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:43,680
<i>... with a possible nude scene by Juliet.</i>
