<i>I had a hangover, and business was
so slow I was rereading old newspapers.</i>

00:02:38,123 --> 00:02:41,627
<i>I was even thinking of closing up
the office for a few days...</i>

[ KNOCK AT DOOR ]

5
00:02:59,311 --> 00:03:01,272
Mr Reardon?
- That's right.

6
00:03:02,106 --> 00:03:04,150
My...

7
00:03:04,275 --> 00:03:06,527
...my name... my...

8
00:03:17,872 --> 00:03:22,334
<i>In all my years in the business,
I'd never seen anything like her.</i>

9
00:03:51,155 --> 00:03:55,075
<i>Was she real? There was
only one way to find out.</i>

10
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:59,205
<i>But I remembered Marlowe's words.</i>

11
00:04:04,418 --> 00:04:06,712
What the hell does Marlowe know?

12
00:04:07,588 --> 00:04:10,549
<i>She was real all right.</i>

13
00:04:14,006 --> 00:04:15,237
What are you doing?

14
00:04:16,722 --> 00:04:19,225
Adjusting your breasts.

15
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:23,354
You fainted and they...
shifted all outta whack.

16
00:04:27,274 --> 00:04:29,693
There.
- Thank you.

17
00:04:30,528 --> 00:04:32,222
You're welcome.

18
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:43,082
Thank you. I... I apologise
for my dramatic entrance.

19
00:04:43,207 --> 00:04:46,836
It's just when I saw
the... newspaper headlines...

20
00:04:50,422 --> 00:04:54,677
- You must be quite a Dodgers fan.
No, I saw... the front page.

21
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:09,650
- What's your name, Dollface?
Juliet Forrest.

22
00:05:10,734 --> 00:05:12,778
Forrest...

23
00:05:13,487 --> 00:05:17,158
Daughter of the big cheesemaker.
You could use a cup of my famous java.

24
00:05:18,617 --> 00:05:21,912
Cheese was Daddy's hobby.
He was a scientist.

25
00:05:22,872 --> 00:05:26,508
Quite an accident he had.
- That's what I came to see you about.

26
00:05:26,553 --> 00:05:29,461
You don't think it was an accident.
You think he was murdered.

27
00:05:29,587 --> 00:05:31,006
How did you know?

28
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:35,759
It's my business to know,
Miss Forrest. Sit down.

29
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,682
What makes you think your father's
death wasn't an accident?

30
00:05:41,807 --> 00:05:44,477
Just before it... it happened...

31
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:50,441
...he behaved very erratically, writing
out lists of names, dozens of them.

32
00:05:50,566 --> 00:05:54,236
He wrote them on blotters
and scratch pads, whatever was handy.

33
00:05:54,361 --> 00:05:57,323
Here's one of the lists... or part of one.

34
00:05:58,365 --> 00:06:00,826
It's from a dollar bill.

35
00:06:02,953 --> 00:06:06,291
Somehow I got the feeling he was
the victim of a giant conspiracy.

36
00:06:10,085 --> 00:06:13,964
You deducted murder
and a giant conspiracy from this?

37
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:16,984
You think I'm too impulsive,
don't you, Mr Reardon?

38
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,962
Maybe.

39
00:06:20,304 --> 00:06:21,756
Maybe not.

40
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:28,179
If you want me to investigate
your father's death, I get $10 a day.

41
00:06:28,604 --> 00:06:30,023
Plus expenses.

42
00:06:32,316 --> 00:06:35,361
Will $200 be enough
in advance, Mr Reardon?

43
00:06:35,486 --> 00:06:38,948
For $200 I'd shoot my grandmother.
- That won't be necessary.

44
00:06:39,073 --> 00:06:40,561
You never can tell.

45
00:06:44,286 --> 00:06:46,997
Where'd your father keep his
papers and correspondence?

46
00:06:47,122 --> 00:06:51,043
- He had a small private office downtown.
Here's the key.

47
00:06:52,628 --> 00:06:56,298
Thank you, Mr Reardon.
I appreciate this.

48
00:06:56,966 --> 00:06:59,260
- Miss Forrest?
Yes?

49
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:03,305
It'd save me some shoe leather if you
told me what address this key fits.

50
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:06,392
It was 429 Firehouse Row.

51
00:07:06,517 --> 00:07:09,186
Pretty seedy part of town
for a renowned scientist.

52
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:12,231
It was the only place he could
experiment with his cheeses...

53
00:07:12,356 --> 00:07:14,501
...without the smell
bothering the neighbours.

54
00:07:16,006 --> 00:07:17,787
I'll see what I can turn up.

55
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:25,119
Good day, Mr Reardon.

56
00:07:26,537 --> 00:07:30,624
<i>On my way to Firehouse Row,
I tried not to think of Juliet Forrest.</i>

57
00:07:30,749 --> 00:07:32,501
<i>I hadn't seen a body
put together like that...</i>

58
00:07:32,626 --> 00:07:36,881
<i>... since I'd solved the case of
the murdered girl with the big tits.</i>

59
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,885
<i>I had no trouble finding
Dr Forrest's cheese lab.</i>

60
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,345
<i>It smelled like the number on the door.</i>

61
00:07:44,221 --> 00:07:46,724
<i>Inside, I turned up
something interesting.</i>

62
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:54,148
"To John Forrest, a dear man who, like
his cheeses, gets stronger with age."

63
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:56,358
"Love, Kitty."

64
00:07:56,484 --> 00:08:00,362
So the old renowned scientist
was getting a little on the side.

65
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:15,544
"Enemies of Carlotta."

66
00:08:16,003 --> 00:08:18,506
"Friends of Carlotta."

67
00:08:24,011 --> 00:08:26,222
"Kitty Collins"?

68
00:08:33,354 --> 00:08:35,022
Sounds like company.

69
00:08:42,938 --> 00:08:44,498
<i>Exterminator.</i>

70
00:08:45,908 --> 00:08:47,660
Just a minute.

71
00:08:54,542 --> 00:08:55,893
Come in.

72
00:09:00,381 --> 00:09:01,733
Sit down.

73
00:09:08,564 --> 00:09:10,050
There's some cookies on the table.

74
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:14,688
Have one.

75
00:09:20,317 --> 00:09:21,670
Good, aren't they?

76
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:33,956
Guess to be a really good exterminator
you have to enjoy killing things.

77
00:09:34,081 --> 00:09:35,257
Yeah.

78
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:41,106
Yes?
- I'd like to see Miss Forrest.

79
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:45,778
Who shall I say is calling?
- Mr Reardon. Tell her I've been shot.

80
00:10:45,903 --> 00:10:47,571
Very good, sir.

81
00:10:47,696 --> 00:10:51,575
May I tell her by whom?
- No. I don't know myself.

82
00:10:52,743 --> 00:10:56,831
Are you all right? You look
as though you're going to faint.

83
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:59,416
Faint? Ha!

84
00:11:00,251 --> 00:11:01,794
Never.

85
00:11:03,546 --> 00:11:05,881
Catch me.
- Sorry.

86
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,309
I'm a butler... not a catcher.

87
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:21,021
Dollface...

88
00:11:24,692 --> 00:11:26,944
What are you doing?!

89
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:35,786
It should feel better now.

90
00:11:39,456 --> 00:11:42,376
Where'd you learn that?
- At camp.

91
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:48,466
You learned that at girls' camp?
- It's really for snakebite, but...

92
00:11:48,591 --> 00:11:50,718
...I find it works for everything.

93
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:56,056
You mumbled about Kitty Collins
and Swede Anderson being on a list.

94
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:59,894
"Friends of Carlotta"?
- That's right. Do you know them?

95
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,390
Kitty was...

96
00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:09,187
...Kitty was someone Daddy
trifled with after Mother dried up.

97
00:12:09,912 --> 00:12:12,572
And Swede was Kitty's boyfriend.

98
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,993
Where are they now?

99
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:18,954
The last I heard,
they were in Santa Barbara.

100
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:22,416
He used to be a boxer.
Now he works in a gas station...

101
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,668
...and she sings in a private club.

102
00:12:28,798 --> 00:12:32,927
You may be interested in this.
I found it in Daddy's study.

103
00:12:34,762 --> 00:12:37,640
"Thanks for the check.
In case I'm indisposed...

104
00:12:37,765 --> 00:12:41,811
...the dollar you gave me for safekeeping
is in the top of the sugar bowl."

105
00:12:41,936 --> 00:12:44,104
- "Shh."
Why?

106
00:12:44,814 --> 00:12:46,441
No. This.

107
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:52,154
No, no, no. That's not "Shh."
It's S-H-H. Samuel H Hastings.

108
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:54,698
My brother-in-law. 0r at least he was.

109
00:12:54,824 --> 00:12:58,702
He and my sister Leona are separated.
He's a hopeless drunk.

110
00:12:58,828 --> 00:13:01,405
Where is he now?
- I don't know.

111
00:13:02,623 --> 00:13:04,292
Get your sister Leona for me.

112
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,044
All right.

113
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:09,922
I'm afraid she may
not be very much help.

114
00:13:10,047 --> 00:13:13,300
She's very disturbed.
- How disturbed?

115
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:16,303
She's been diagnosed
as a paranoid hypochondriac.

116
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:20,057
Doctors think she may be faking.
- I'll know after one word if she is.

117
00:13:23,561 --> 00:13:25,312
Hello?
- She's faking.

118
00:13:25,407 --> 00:13:26,508
Mrs Hastings?

119
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:32,444
No, he hasn't.
He won't be back till Sunday.

120
00:13:32,695 --> 00:13:35,406
Sunday? You don't understand,
Mrs Hastings.

121
00:13:35,531 --> 00:13:37,675
I'm investigating your father's death.

122
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:41,346
My father called me from Chicago
tonight. He never mentioned a word!

123
00:13:42,371 --> 00:13:44,040
Maybe it slipped his mind.

124
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:48,377
Look, uh, your father
is dead, Mrs Hastings.

125
00:13:48,502 --> 00:13:51,372
Your sister Juliet feels
his death wasn't an accident.

126
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:53,924
What are you talking about?

127
00:13:54,049 --> 00:13:56,802
<i>I had a long talk with him
just a little while ago.</i>

128
00:13:56,927 --> 00:14:01,807
<i>He told me terrible things about you.</i>
- Listen, you phony fruitcake!

129
00:14:03,726 --> 00:14:07,521
Sorry I called you a fruitcake.
I just don't have time to listen to...

130
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:10,107
All right, don't listen! Who cares?

131
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,861
Your sister has a lot to learn
about phone courtesy.

132
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:16,455
You got any idea
how I could locate Sam?

133
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,358
You might ask the bartenders
along 5th Street.

134
00:14:19,783 --> 00:14:22,244
I'll call you if I turn up anything.

135
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:28,102
0h... If I'm not home, leave a message
with the butler or the cleaning woman.

136
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:34,665
Cleaning woman.

137
00:14:36,592 --> 00:14:39,011
Cleaning woman.

138
00:14:39,637 --> 00:14:41,889
Cleaning woman.

139
00:14:42,765 --> 00:14:46,227
Cleaning woman! Cleaning woman!

140
00:14:46,477 --> 00:14:48,896
Cleaning woman! Cleaning woman!

141
00:14:49,146 --> 00:14:51,357
Cleaning woman! Cleaning woman!

142
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,642
Sorry.

143
00:15:12,586 --> 00:15:15,005
Why did you do that?

144
00:15:19,468 --> 00:15:22,096
When I was seven years old...

145
00:15:22,763 --> 00:15:25,432
...my father ran off with the cleaning...

146
00:15:30,146 --> 00:15:32,148
My mother died of a broken heart.

147
00:15:33,274 --> 00:15:36,152
Now every time
someone says cleaning...

148
00:15:43,367 --> 00:15:46,704
...I go berserk.
- 0h! You poor dear.

149
00:15:47,705 --> 00:15:50,249
I don't blame you for strangling me.

150
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,011
I'll never say it again.

151
00:15:54,795 --> 00:15:56,839
Thanks.

152
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,343
So long, Dollface.

153
00:16:11,061 --> 00:16:14,398
<i>I legged it down 5th Street
looking for Samuel H Hastings.</i>

154
00:16:14,523 --> 00:16:17,443
<i>It was a street of frustrated hopes
and broken dreams.</i>

155
00:16:17,568 --> 00:16:22,865
<i>Everything was cheap, cut-rate.
Even the prostitutes were having a sale.</i>

156
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:27,995
<i>There was no problem finding Hastings.
He owed money to every bartender.</i>

157
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,583
<i>He was staying at the Hotel Ward on
5th Street. It used to be on 8th Street...</i>

158
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:37,296
<i>... but they took so many rubber cheques,
it bounced all the way across town.</i>

159
00:16:37,421 --> 00:16:39,882
<i>I went to his room and knocked.</i>

160
00:16:52,061 --> 00:16:55,356
Hastings? Sam Hastings?
- Who is it?

161
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:58,943
My name is Reardon.
I... have a proposition for ya.

162
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,363
But not today. Does it have to be today?

163
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:03,532
Yeah.

164
00:17:06,075 --> 00:17:08,120
I got that money for ya.

165
00:17:10,246 --> 00:17:13,207
- There's a dollar bill
hidden in your sugar bowl.

166
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,793
I'll give you five bucks for it.

167
00:17:16,544 --> 00:17:20,047
You could buy a lotta booze with that.
- Just a minute.

168
00:17:24,718 --> 00:17:25,954
Look in the top.

169
00:17:40,943 --> 00:17:45,156
It fits perfectly.
Most of the names are illegible...

170
00:17:45,281 --> 00:17:48,006
...but I can work out
Kitty Collins and Swede Anderson.

171
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,754
But what does "F0C" mean?

172
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:57,126
It's a slang word. When a man and a
woman are in love, the man puts his...

173
00:17:57,251 --> 00:17:59,712
No, no. Written here. F-0-C.

174
00:18:00,296 --> 00:18:04,425
0h. Unless I miss my guess,
that stands for "Friends of Carlotta".

175
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:09,346
I'm impressed.
- You think that's impressive...

176
00:18:14,685 --> 00:18:18,022
<i>There I was, standing like a kid
doing corny tricks for her...</i>

177
00:18:18,147 --> 00:18:21,442
<i>... driving miles out of my way
just to see her.</i>

178
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,694
<i>Why?</i>

179
00:18:24,487 --> 00:18:26,947
What are you thinking, Mr Reardon?

180
00:18:28,616 --> 00:18:32,252
So long, Dollface. I'll be
in Santa Barbara if you need me.

181
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:43,923
<i>I found out Kitty Collins
was working at the Brentwood Room.</i>

182
00:18:44,048 --> 00:18:45,716
<i>The Brentwood Room.</i>

183
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:49,970
<i>Where rich women go to meet rich men
so they can have rich kids.</i>

184
00:18:59,688 --> 00:19:01,690
Miss Collins?

185
00:19:01,816 --> 00:19:05,903
<i>Kitty wouldn't give me any information
if she thought I was a private eye...</i>

186
00:19:06,028 --> 00:19:07,488
Excuse me.

187
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:10,991
<i>... so I decided to act like
a big-shot movie producer.</i>

188
00:19:11,867 --> 00:19:15,329
My name's Reardon. I make movies.
- How wonderful of you.

189
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:17,458
You like boxing pictures?

190
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:25,297
- I'm casting a big boxing picture at RK0.
I'm looking for a singer. You interested?

191
00:19:25,422 --> 00:19:29,468
The idea of two men beating
each other to a pulp makes me ill.

192
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:33,055
Well, I'm also doing a religious picture.

193
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:36,392
<i>The Story of Saint... Betty.</i>

194
00:19:38,018 --> 00:19:42,481
You know, the... nun who
taught the lepers how to sing.

195
00:19:43,357 --> 00:19:45,734
- <i>How wonderful of you.</i>
Thanks.

196
00:19:47,528 --> 00:19:50,781
John Hay Forrest said
you were a friend of Carlotta's.

197
00:19:50,906 --> 00:19:52,908
- <i>Will you excuse me?</i>

198
00:19:53,033 --> 00:19:56,453
<i>I must have hit a nerve.
She went white as a ghost.</i>

199
00:19:56,912 --> 00:20:00,875
<i>The next day I tailed Kitty Collins
to a fancy restaurant.</i>

200
00:20:04,128 --> 00:20:08,215
<i>Midway through the meal, she noticed
me and did a pretty strange thing.</i>

201
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,843
<i>She took off her brooch and ditched it.</i>

202
00:20:11,594 --> 00:20:14,263
<i>I had a pretty good idea where.</i>

203
00:20:29,111 --> 00:20:31,906
Hold it, pal. I'm from
the health department.

204
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:36,243
We have a report that your soup
has too much jewellery in it.

205
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:00,309
"E0C." Enemies of Carlotta.

206
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:06,482
<i>The only name on the list that
wasn't crossed out was Swede Anderson.</i>

207
00:21:06,607 --> 00:21:10,444
<i>I decided to drop in on him
before they crossed him out too.</i>

208
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:12,738
<i>Swede wasn't living in luxury.</i>

209
00:21:12,863 --> 00:21:16,700
<i>As a matter of fact, for a moment,
I thought he wasn't living at all.</i>

210
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:21,080
Swede?

211
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,127
Sorry, Swede. I thought
you'd been murdered.

212
00:21:27,461 --> 00:21:29,713
Come on, wake up!

213
00:21:31,215 --> 00:21:32,633
Come on, Swede.

214
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,638
You need a cup of my java.

215
00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:03,390
You're up. Good. The java
will be ready in a minute.

216
00:23:21,617 --> 00:23:24,411
This is never gonna heal.

217
00:23:35,673 --> 00:23:40,427
Anyway, my guess is by now Kitty
Collins is a million miles from here.

218
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,224
Do you think Swede was killed by
the same man who murdered my father?

219
00:23:45,349 --> 00:23:49,895
Hold it, Dollface. No one's proved
your father's been murdered...

220
00:23:51,772 --> 00:23:53,649
...yet.

221
00:23:53,774 --> 00:23:57,194
But you may be right about
this being a conspiracy.

222
00:23:57,319 --> 00:24:01,198
It's big. Maybe too big
for me to handle alone.

223
00:24:01,866 --> 00:24:03,993
Get me a cup of java, will ya?

224
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:10,291
Yeah?
- <i>Hello, Marlowe?</i>

225
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,710
0h, hello, Bernie.
- No, it's me, Rigby.

226
00:24:12,835 --> 00:24:13,836
<i>- What's up?</i>

227
00:24:13,961 --> 00:24:17,506
I'm on an important case. I need
your help. How soon can you get here?

228
00:24:17,631 --> 00:24:19,602
I just woke up.
I haven't had breakfast.

229
00:24:22,927 --> 00:24:23,863
<i>- It's two o'clock.</i>
Two o'clock?

230
00:24:24,388 --> 00:24:27,349
- Hustle on over here.
I'll make you a cup of my famous java.

231
00:24:27,475 --> 00:24:29,003
I'd rather buy my own.

232
00:24:31,228 --> 00:24:34,190
And Marlowe. Wear a tie, for God's sake.

233
00:24:38,027 --> 00:24:39,354
What's that?

234
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:42,323
I found it in Daddy's desk.

235
00:24:44,366 --> 00:24:48,454
It looks like a key to one of
those lockers at the train station.

236
00:24:48,579 --> 00:24:52,416
Number's been filed off.
What's it say on that envelope?

237
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:55,628
"Most recent rat."

238
00:24:57,213 --> 00:25:00,382
Very clever.
- You mean you understand what it means?

239
00:25:00,508 --> 00:25:04,303
Just a hunch. You know the Chinese
have a different animal for every year?

240
00:25:04,428 --> 00:25:07,556
Yes.
- Unless I miss my guess...

241
00:25:07,681 --> 00:25:10,768
...the most recent
Year of the Rat was 1936.

242
00:25:11,602 --> 00:25:14,563
This is the key to locker number 1936.

243
00:25:15,815 --> 00:25:18,776
You're a very smart man.
- So was Abraham Lincoln.

244
00:25:18,901 --> 00:25:22,404
Look what happened to him.
Smart can get you killed.

245
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:28,202
I hope not.

246
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:31,956
Sometimes I feel I would like to...

247
00:25:35,084 --> 00:25:37,586
<i>You'd like to what? Kiss me?</i>

248
00:25:38,254 --> 00:25:40,131
<i>Yeah, that would be nice.</i>

249
00:25:40,256 --> 00:25:44,510
<i>It would give me a chance to tell her
I was starting to feel something for her.</i>

250
00:25:44,635 --> 00:25:46,929
<i>Something warm and squishy.</i>

251
00:25:47,388 --> 00:25:52,560
<i>But a man in my business can't
take on a wife, have a bunch of kids.</i>

252
00:25:54,228 --> 00:25:57,356
We wouldn't have to have kids.
- What?

253
00:26:00,693 --> 00:26:02,945
Look, this is getting us nowhere.

254
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,697
But thanks anyway.

255
00:26:04,822 --> 00:26:08,742
You'd better go now.
Marlowe's coming over here to talk.

256
00:26:12,872 --> 00:26:15,166
If you need me, just call.

257
00:26:18,794 --> 00:26:21,172
You know how to dial, don't you?

258
00:26:21,297 --> 00:26:25,968
You just put your finger in the hole,
and make tiny little circles.

259
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:42,860
Come on in. It's open.

260
00:26:47,156 --> 00:26:48,408
Hello, Marlowe.

261
00:26:49,533 --> 00:26:52,453
Dammit. You didn't do what I told ya.

262
00:26:52,995 --> 00:26:56,540
I hate that dumb way of wearing
your shirt buttoned with no tie.

263
00:26:56,665 --> 00:26:58,168
Let me get you a tie.

264
00:26:59,752 --> 00:27:03,389
Here. This one's blue,
but you can wear it with brown.

265
00:27:03,714 --> 00:27:04,883
You annoy me.

266
00:27:06,509 --> 00:27:09,929
You come in here with no tie...
Are you drunk?

267
00:27:10,054 --> 00:27:12,848
How many have you had?
- 0ne martini.

268
00:27:12,973 --> 00:27:15,601
I knew I was gonna see you.
- Sit down.

269
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:23,292
- Here's what I want you to do.

270
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:31,033
Here's a list of names I found in a
bowl of soup. Don't ask me to explain.

271
00:27:31,158 --> 00:27:33,828
I think they're all dead.
I want you to check 'em out.

272
00:27:33,953 --> 00:27:37,456
And Marlowe? Put this on
for me, huh? As a favour.

273
00:27:37,581 --> 00:27:39,234
It's a clip-on.

274
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:47,800
<i>I put Marlowe to work checking Kitty's
soup list against recent unsolved murders...</i>

275
00:27:47,925 --> 00:27:50,219
<i>... while I Yellow-cabbed it
down to the train station...</i>

276
00:27:50,344 --> 00:27:54,181
<i>... to see how Dr Forrest's key
would fit into the puzzle.</i>

277
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:57,643
<i>I sashayed over to locker number 1936.</i>

278
00:27:59,103 --> 00:28:02,940
<i>The key fit like a glove.
As I opened the locker...</i>

279
00:28:03,065 --> 00:28:06,652
<i>... I noticed a handsome guy
in a grey pinstripe watching me.</i>

280
00:28:06,777 --> 00:28:10,948
<i>It seemed I wasn't the only one who was
interested in the contents of that locker.</i>

281
00:28:11,365 --> 00:28:14,910
<i>Inside were two long lists of
Carlotta's friends and enemies.</i>

282
00:28:15,035 --> 00:28:17,705
<i>The first name that jumped out
was FX Huberman...</i>

283
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:21,083
<i>... number 46 Bay Court Drive,
Grunion Point.</i>

284
00:28:22,168 --> 00:28:26,255
<i>I decided to take a little train ride
and visit Mr Huberman.</i>

285
00:28:26,922 --> 00:28:30,009
<i>I knew "Handsome" would follow me,
so to throw him off...</i>

286
00:28:30,134 --> 00:28:33,846
<i>... I cleverly ducked into
the men's room and lost him.</i>

287
00:28:34,722 --> 00:28:39,185
<i>There was no way he could follow me
unless I had toilet paper on my shoe.</i>

288
00:28:41,937 --> 00:28:43,981
Damn!

289
00:28:49,111 --> 00:28:51,989
<i>It wasn't really toilet paper,
it was a seat cover...</i>

290
00:28:52,114 --> 00:28:55,826
<i>... but it was enough for
a smart guy to make the connection.</i>

291
00:28:56,827 --> 00:28:58,787
<i>As soon as we went into a tunnel...</i>

292
00:28:58,913 --> 00:29:03,667
<i>... Handsome popped in and started
looking for a match... in my pockets.</i>

293
00:29:04,794 --> 00:29:08,422
Oh! Was that your leg?
- No, it was my face.

294
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:10,758
I had no idea we were
going into a tunnel.

295
00:29:10,883 --> 00:29:13,135
I'm sure.

296
00:29:13,803 --> 00:29:15,846
I thought the compartment was empty.

297
00:29:15,971 --> 00:29:18,098
Yeah, right. Uh-huh, sure.

298
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:23,479
I'm so sorry. I hope I didn't hurt you.
- It's all right.

299
00:29:26,482 --> 00:29:28,984
To what do I owe
the pleasure of your company?

300
00:29:29,109 --> 00:29:32,006
The man in the next compartment's
smoking a vile cigar.

301
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:35,866
I had to come in here.
You don't smoke, do you?

302
00:29:35,991 --> 00:29:39,161
No, I have tuberculosis.
- 0h, thank heavens for that.

303
00:29:39,186 --> 00:29:41,223
After last night,
my head couldn't stand it.

304
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:51,423
<i>I didn't want him to know where I was
going so I decided to put him away fast.</i>

305
00:29:53,175 --> 00:29:55,302
<i>I always carry my harmonica.</i>

306
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:59,748
<i>It's lighter than an accordion,
and more powerful than a sleeping pill.</i>

307
00:30:06,147 --> 00:30:10,234
<i>I left him napping like a baby
when I ducked out at Grunion Point.</i>

308
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:19,577
Here's three bucks if you can get
this cab to 46 Bay Court in ten minutes.

309
00:30:23,873 --> 00:30:26,333
Follow that cab!

310
00:30:28,669 --> 00:30:30,754
<i>It was a pretty clever thing I did.</i>

311
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,634
<i>By taking the only two cabs, I made
sure Handsome couldn't follow me.</i>

312
00:30:37,761 --> 00:30:40,764
<i>When I arrived at Mr Huberman's,
I was surprised.</i>

313
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:45,144
<i>Mr Huberman turned out to be
a sexy dame who was throwing a party.</i>

314
00:30:45,269 --> 00:30:49,565
<i>She didn't even ask me what I wanted,
just made me feel real welcome.</i>

315
00:30:54,153 --> 00:30:57,990
How about you, handsome?
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?

316
00:30:58,115 --> 00:31:00,659
Maybe. I've been somewhere before.

317
00:31:01,202 --> 00:31:04,997
It's nice of you to invite me.
I feel a little like a party crasher.

318
00:31:05,122 --> 00:31:07,541
I like party crashers.

319
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:09,894
I like classy dames with bedroom eyes.

320
00:31:10,419 --> 00:31:12,463
You know something? I like you.

321
00:31:12,588 --> 00:31:13,665
I like me too.

322
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:19,136
When these people leave, maybe...
you and I can have a party of our own.

323
00:31:19,261 --> 00:31:21,680
0h, I... I have to think that over.

324
00:31:23,007 --> 00:31:24,600
<i>She was a fast thinker.</i>

325
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:29,647
- I'm very sorry. You all have to go.
It has been a perfectly hideous party.

326
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:33,442
Good night.
- Good night.

327
00:31:55,009 --> 00:31:57,050
Stuffy in here, isn't it?

328
00:31:59,468 --> 00:32:02,555
<i>Suddenly I realised
she'd slipped me a Mickey.</i>

329
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:07,351
<i>My lips felt like two manhole covers.
My tongue felt like it had hair on it.</i>

330
00:32:07,476 --> 00:32:10,980
<i>My ears started to ring. I felt like a dog.</i>

331
00:32:13,649 --> 00:32:15,359
Woof!

332
00:32:15,484 --> 00:32:17,486
Woof, Huberman, woof!

333
00:32:17,611 --> 00:32:20,281
Come on. Let's go out dancin'.

334
00:32:21,282 --> 00:32:24,827
You put on your black dress,
and I'll go shave my tongue.

335
00:32:34,086 --> 00:32:36,714
♫ Barbasol, Barbasol

336
00:32:37,173 --> 00:32:39,216
♫ No brush, no lather, no rub-in

337
00:32:39,341 --> 00:32:41,051
♫ Wet your razor then begin

338
00:32:41,177 --> 00:32:44,597
♫ Barbasol, Barbasol

339
00:32:44,722 --> 00:32:47,266
♫ 0ompah, oompah, oompah, oompah,
Barbasol... ♫

340
00:33:17,004 --> 00:33:18,631
Come on, FX. I'm ready!

341
00:33:20,132 --> 00:33:22,384
Let's go dancing.

342
00:33:35,856 --> 00:33:36,982
Hold it!

343
00:33:37,491 --> 00:33:39,052
Sorry, Dollface.

344
00:33:40,444 --> 00:33:44,156
How did you get here?
- Your door was open, so I walked in.

345
00:33:45,074 --> 00:33:48,828
I've been trying to call you all night.
- How did I get here?

346
00:33:48,953 --> 00:33:52,373
I guess you must have crawled.
- 0h, God!

347
00:33:53,624 --> 00:33:56,168
0h, no, that's 0K.
- It's just a little alcohol.

348
00:33:56,293 --> 00:33:58,254
Really, they don't hurt at all.
- Don't be a baby.

349
00:33:58,379 --> 00:34:00,298
Get back!

350
00:34:04,593 --> 00:34:06,271
What's up?

351
00:34:08,264 --> 00:34:10,891
Sam Hastings is dead.

352
00:34:11,016 --> 00:34:13,519
Poor rummy. How did he get it?

353
00:34:13,644 --> 00:34:16,422
Fell out of a window
reaching for a bottle of whisky.

354
00:34:17,148 --> 00:34:21,318
He could have been pushed. I'll have
Marlowe check his back for fingerprints.

355
00:34:21,443 --> 00:34:23,988
Anything else?
- Yes.

356
00:34:24,113 --> 00:34:27,158
I found another note
Daddy wrote to himself.

357
00:34:27,283 --> 00:34:29,118
"NYTAG-216."

358
00:34:29,243 --> 00:34:31,821
I think it's a New York
licence plate number.

359
00:34:32,246 --> 00:34:35,624
Not bad, Dollface.
Unless I'm... 0hh! Agh!

360
00:34:35,749 --> 00:34:38,002
Careful. Let me get you some alcohol.

361
00:34:38,127 --> 00:34:40,171
No!

362
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:49,388
It's not N-Y TAG. It's N-Y-T.

363
00:34:50,347 --> 00:34:52,600
<i>New York Times.</i>

364
00:34:58,314 --> 00:35:00,274
So what's "A-G"?

365
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:04,320
That's standard library talk for August.
- And 216?

366
00:35:04,737 --> 00:35:08,449
Stands for the August 2nd issue,
page one, column six.

367
00:35:09,658 --> 00:35:11,911
Extension 20, please.

368
00:35:12,369 --> 00:35:14,538
Hi. It's me, Rigby.

369
00:35:14,663 --> 00:35:16,624
Sorry, Hot Legs, I've been busy.

370
00:35:16,749 --> 00:35:19,210
Look, you sashay over to
your <i>New York Times</i> file...

371
00:35:19,335 --> 00:35:23,422
...read me what's on page one,
column six of the August 2nd issue...

372
00:35:23,547 --> 00:35:26,133
...maybe I'll wine and dine you
some night soon.

373
00:35:26,258 --> 00:35:27,301
I'll wait.

374
00:35:27,426 --> 00:35:29,845
You'd wine and dine her for information?

375
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:32,348
Her? Him.

376
00:35:32,473 --> 00:35:35,142
Yeah... Then read me the whole article.

377
00:35:38,771 --> 00:35:41,023
<i>"Immer Essen".</i>

378
00:35:41,857 --> 00:35:44,235
Walter Neff's the owner.

379
00:35:45,236 --> 00:35:47,696
Thanks, Hot Legs. I owe you a big one.

380
00:35:48,322 --> 00:35:50,574
<i>Immer essen.</i>

381
00:35:53,494 --> 00:35:56,080
<i>Immer essen.</i>
That means "always eating".

382
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:58,707
What language?
- German.

383
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:02,211
It's also the name of
a South American cruise ship.

384
00:36:02,336 --> 00:36:07,299
I know! When Sam Hastings
and my sister separated last July...

385
00:36:08,175 --> 00:36:10,594
...he took a South American tour
on that ship.

386
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:12,847
Very interesting.

387
00:36:12,972 --> 00:36:16,475
Right after that tour,
the company cancelled its cruises.

388
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,270
Now Sam Hastings is dead.

389
00:36:19,395 --> 00:36:23,941
I don't see the connection.
- I don't either. That's what bothers me.

390
00:36:38,745 --> 00:36:39,838
Hello?

391
00:36:40,541 --> 00:36:42,418
Who is it?
- This is Marlowe.

392
00:36:42,835 --> 00:36:46,464
0h, hello, Mr Marlowe.
Would you hold a moment, please?

393
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:49,501
It's Marlowe.
- Good.

394
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,234
Hello, Marlowe. Listen, don't check out
those unsolved murders right now.

395
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:08,444
Yeah? Why not?

396
00:37:08,569 --> 00:37:12,491
I got something more important. You
ever had any dealings with Walter Neff?

397
00:37:13,616 --> 00:37:16,952
Walter Neff. He runs
a South American cruise-ship company.

398
00:37:17,995 --> 00:37:19,789
Good. Tell me about him.

399
00:37:19,955 --> 00:37:23,042
Cruises supermarkets
looking for blondes?

400
00:37:24,418 --> 00:37:27,338
Good. I'll supply the blonde.

401
00:37:32,593 --> 00:37:33,928
Marlowe, one other thing.

402
00:37:34,261 --> 00:37:37,973
If Walter Neff leaves the country,
I may have to take a little boat ride.

403
00:37:38,098 --> 00:37:43,103
If I do, stay off the booze. These
people we're dealing with are killers.

404
00:37:43,229 --> 00:37:46,816
Well, thanks for telling me.
Have a nice trip.

405
00:37:46,941 --> 00:37:49,702
I may not leave right away,
but thanks anyway. And Marlowe?

406
00:37:50,528 --> 00:37:52,863
<i>- You wearin' a tie?</i>
Goodbye.

407
00:37:56,992 --> 00:37:59,537
What was that all about?
- Marlowe knows Neff.

408
00:37:59,662 --> 00:38:02,540
Says he's a pushover
for beautiful blondes.

409
00:38:02,665 --> 00:38:05,042
It means we need a female spy.

410
00:38:10,214 --> 00:38:12,216
Why not use me?

411
00:38:17,054 --> 00:38:19,181
Sorry.

412
00:38:19,306 --> 00:38:21,684
You're not blonde enough.

413
00:38:34,488 --> 00:38:38,159
I can always dye my hair.
- No dice, Dollface. You're a client.

414
00:38:38,284 --> 00:38:42,372
That's one thing I've learned about
clients. Dead ones don't pay their bills.

415
00:38:47,501 --> 00:38:49,795
Is that all you think of me?

416
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,298
Someone who pays you $10 a day?

417
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:02,099
That's right, Dollface.
To me you're just a meal ticket.

418
00:39:04,518 --> 00:39:06,812
<i>How could I tell her that I was lying?</i>

419
00:39:06,937 --> 00:39:10,941
<i>I'd work for nothing just to watch
her hair bounce as she walked...</i>

420
00:39:11,066 --> 00:39:14,820
<i>... smell her creamy skin,
cradle her head on my shoulder.</i>

421
00:39:15,488 --> 00:39:18,949
<i>Feel the slope of her waist,
the curve of her back...</i>

422
00:39:19,074 --> 00:39:22,161
<i>... and then gently caress
her two beautiful...</i>

423
00:39:27,792 --> 00:39:30,211
I'm sorry.

424
00:39:30,336 --> 00:39:33,464
I just don't like
being called a meal ticket.

425
00:39:48,729 --> 00:39:53,108
<i>As I started my search for a blonde spy,
I tried to get rid of the image of Juliet...</i>

426
00:39:53,234 --> 00:39:57,154
<i>... storming out of my office
with toothpaste on her shoes.</i>

427
00:39:58,864 --> 00:40:03,035
<i>First on my list was Monica Stillpond,
a bombshell who once told me...</i>

428
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:07,706
<i>... she would do anything
for anybody anywhere at any time.</i>

429
00:40:09,917 --> 00:40:12,545
- But muscle gave me
my start in politics.

430
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:16,006
It was when I was assistant
to old man Zimmerman, the plumber.

431
00:40:16,132 --> 00:40:19,969
Mr Madvig, you're joking.
- About the plumbing, or the muscle?

432
00:40:20,094 --> 00:40:22,638
I just can't imagine you as a plumber.

433
00:40:23,139 --> 00:40:25,474
<i>She was in the middle
of a fancy dinner party.</i>

434
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:29,645
<i>But I couldn't waste time being polite.
I caught her attention.</i>

435
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:36,652
Coffee will be served
in the living room, Mr Madvig.

436
00:40:37,862 --> 00:40:43,075
<i>One thing about Monica: The words
"I can't" weren't in her vocabulary.</i>

437
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,703
Monica, I want you
to do something for me.

438
00:40:46,228 --> 00:40:47,413
I can't.

439
00:40:48,038 --> 00:40:51,834
<i>I guess she had added them
since the last time I'd seen her.</i>

440
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:56,839
<i>The next one on my list was
Doris Devermont, an old flame of mine.</i>

441
00:40:56,964 --> 00:41:00,634
<i>With her I'd had the most honest
relationship I'd ever had with a woman.</i>

442
00:41:00,759 --> 00:41:05,347
<i>The only thing I'd lied about was my
name. I'd told her I was Teddy Novak...</i>

443
00:41:05,473 --> 00:41:08,976
<i>... so she couldn't track me down
if I got her pregnant.</i>

444
00:41:16,233 --> 00:41:18,360
<i>Doris remembered me, naturally.</i>

445
00:41:18,486 --> 00:41:20,446
How do you do, Mr Novak?

446
00:41:20,571 --> 00:41:25,826
Mr Novak? No hugs, no kisses? We used
to flop into each other's arms, Doris.

447
00:41:25,951 --> 00:41:29,997
Well, don't you think we really ought to
get to know each other all over again?

448
00:41:30,122 --> 00:41:34,710
It's only been five years. You were about
to serve me dinner when I had to leave.

449
00:41:34,835 --> 00:41:37,213
How stupid of me.
You must be famished.

450
00:41:37,338 --> 00:41:41,342
I should have thought of it sooner.
I'll get some coffee and sandwiches.

451
00:41:42,635 --> 00:41:45,054
<i>Coffee and sandwiches.</i>

452
00:41:45,179 --> 00:41:48,349
<i>Now I remembered Doris's
famous stale-bread sandwiches.</i>

453
00:41:49,225 --> 00:41:54,188
<i>She'd buy day-old bread, then toast it
to cover up. I wonder if she's changed.</i>

454
00:41:54,313 --> 00:41:57,191
The bread's none too fresh.
Shall I toast it?

455
00:41:58,025 --> 00:42:00,706
No, thanks.
I gave up stale toast for Lent.

456
00:42:01,445 --> 00:42:04,431
Lent?
- Nothing.

457
00:42:04,782 --> 00:42:06,784
<i>Same old Doris.</i>

458
00:42:06,909 --> 00:42:09,995
<i>She used to get smoked turkey
so it would keep for months.</i>

459
00:42:10,121 --> 00:42:12,873
<i>When it finally went bad,
she'd feed it to the maid.</i>

460
00:42:12,998 --> 00:42:16,961
I had some smoked turkey. I guess
the cleaning woman had it for her lunch.

461
00:42:17,086 --> 00:42:19,338
0h, here's some pâté.

462
00:42:21,841 --> 00:42:24,093
Cleaning woman.

463
00:42:26,762 --> 00:42:29,014
Cleaning woman.

464
00:42:29,557 --> 00:42:31,809
Cleaning woman!

465
00:42:32,184 --> 00:42:35,354
Cleaning woman! Cleaning woman!

466
00:42:35,855 --> 00:42:38,190
Cleaning woman! Cleaning woman!

467
00:42:53,956 --> 00:42:55,124
Sorry.

468
00:42:58,169 --> 00:43:03,174
<i>I was too embarrassed to ask Doris for
a favour after I'd tried to strangle her...</i>

469
00:43:03,299 --> 00:43:06,760
<i>... so I went to the next name
in my little black book.</i>

470
00:43:06,886 --> 00:43:11,682
<i>The blondest one on my list was a rich
society dame named Jimmi Sue Altfeld.</i>

471
00:43:11,807 --> 00:43:16,604
<i>I almost hated to use her - she was so
in love with me, it nearly made me sick.</i>

472
00:43:16,729 --> 00:43:19,148
<i>But business was more important.</i>

473
00:43:19,273 --> 00:43:22,276
<i>I wined her and dined her
at the Plantation Club.</i>

474
00:43:22,401 --> 00:43:24,653
<i>Then I made my move.</i>

475
00:43:25,821 --> 00:43:30,451
Last time we saw each other, I left you
alone sitting at a counter at Schwab's.

476
00:43:31,243 --> 00:43:34,455
- You don't hate me for that, do you?
0f course I don't.

477
00:43:34,789 --> 00:43:36,499
Good...

478
00:43:36,624 --> 00:43:39,293
I'd like to discuss something with you.

479
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,172
Where to?
- Take me home.

480
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:47,593
<i>There was no way I was gonna
take her home. Her father hated me.</i>

481
00:43:47,718 --> 00:43:52,014
<i>So I told her to meet me at a motel and
I'd show her something with my hands.</i>

482
00:44:24,747 --> 00:44:26,199
Come in.

483
00:44:31,178 --> 00:44:33,055
Well, Jimmi Sue, you ready?

484
00:44:33,973 --> 00:44:35,592
What are we going to do?

485
00:44:37,203 --> 00:44:39,103
Kinsey from cover to cover.

486
00:44:55,369 --> 00:44:59,957
Has anyone ever told you that your lips
are like two succulent Brussels sprouts...

487
00:45:00,002 --> 00:45:03,701
...waiting to be buttered and bitten?
- Plenty of men have.

488
00:45:05,129 --> 00:45:07,081
Really?

489
00:45:08,591 --> 00:45:10,384
Have these men ever told you...

490
00:45:10,509 --> 00:45:15,389
...that your eyes are like Chinese coins
with dollops of caviar in the centre?

491
00:45:15,514 --> 00:45:18,017
Can't you see how happy
you and I would be together here?

492
00:45:18,142 --> 00:45:22,605
Yes, I do. But I want you to come
back to the city with me first.

493
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:28,194
I'm working on an important case. It's
dangerous, and you'll probably be killed.

494
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:31,697
But if you love me, you'll do it.
- Yes, I do love you.

495
00:45:31,822 --> 00:45:37,328
And I love you. And I mean that more
than anything I've ever said in my life.

496
00:45:48,672 --> 00:45:53,552
<i>I rented an apartment and started giving
Jimmi instructions on how to pump Neff.</i>

497
00:45:53,677 --> 00:45:56,722
<i>She took direction
like a pig takes to garbage.</i>

498
00:45:56,847 --> 00:45:58,933
Here's a picture of our Mr Neff.

499
00:45:59,058 --> 00:46:01,727
Do, uh, whatever you have to...

500
00:46:01,852 --> 00:46:04,563
...to find out what happened
on the <i>Immer Essen.</i>

501
00:46:04,688 --> 00:46:08,275
Your father threatened to have me
beat up if I continue to see ya.

502
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,071
Thought I'd drop over there tomorrow
with a little peace offering.

503
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:14,573
What could I take that'd soften him up?

504
00:46:14,698 --> 00:46:16,859
He never had a dog when he was a boy.

505
00:46:18,035 --> 00:46:20,287
Never had a dog, huh?

506
00:46:30,256 --> 00:46:31,316
Mr Altfeld?

507
00:46:36,095 --> 00:46:38,472
Totally house-broken.

508
00:46:39,348 --> 00:46:42,101
His name is... Ramon.

509
00:46:42,476 --> 00:46:44,728
He's yours.

510
00:46:50,568 --> 00:46:52,328
Get out, thief!

511
00:46:53,054 --> 00:46:57,508
I'm not stealing your daughter. I'm just
borrowing her for an important case.

512
00:46:58,451 --> 00:47:03,789
Don't go near my daughter. Don't try
to see her. Don't write and don't phone.

513
00:47:03,914 --> 00:47:06,625
Can I use her underwear to make soup?

514
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:09,253
- Get out!
Mr Altfeld...

515
00:47:09,378 --> 00:47:12,465
... it's true that by helping me,
your daughter's life is in danger.

516
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:16,260
But she may save hundreds of lives.
You wouldn't stand in the way of that.

517
00:47:16,385 --> 00:47:18,429
Why certainly I would!

518
00:47:18,721 --> 00:47:23,567
I'd frame you or kill you...
if it would protect my daughter.

519
00:47:24,101 --> 00:47:28,355
And I brought you a puppy,
something you never had as a boy.

520
00:47:28,481 --> 00:47:30,233
- Now get out!

521
00:47:31,358 --> 00:47:33,219
Come on, Ramon.

522
00:47:36,113 --> 00:47:37,509
You don't deserve a puppy.

523
00:47:40,034 --> 00:47:41,827
Wait!

524
00:47:42,908 --> 00:47:43,931
Pick that up.

525
00:47:46,707 --> 00:47:50,189
But it's all soft and steamy.
- Pick that up!

526
00:47:52,963 --> 00:47:55,424
You're a sick man, Altfeld.

527
00:48:02,973 --> 00:48:07,728
You can make me pick up dog dirt,
but you can't stop me seeing Jimmi Sue.

528
00:48:14,610 --> 00:48:17,071
You want a puppy?
- I'd love a dog.

529
00:48:18,072 --> 00:48:19,824
Thank you.

530
00:48:19,949 --> 00:48:23,160
Here's something for you, too.
- 0h, thank you.

531
00:48:25,246 --> 00:48:26,330
- Eugh!

532
00:48:31,961 --> 00:48:34,380
Well, Larry, Moe and Curly.

533
00:48:38,926 --> 00:48:40,003
Thanks, Dan.

534
00:48:41,428 --> 00:48:44,348
Not a very nice way to treat
a friend of Mr Altfeld's daughter.

535
00:48:44,473 --> 00:48:46,642
There's only one way to treat you.

536
00:48:50,938 --> 00:48:53,232
You got some pretty smart monkeys here.

537
00:48:55,693 --> 00:48:59,196
I notice this one's wearing
a Phi Beta Kappa key here.

538
00:49:02,158 --> 00:49:03,261
0w!

539
00:49:05,786 --> 00:49:08,530
I'm gonna have some sense
beaten into you.

540
00:49:09,165 --> 00:49:13,502
What's he payin' you boys? I'll double
it and we'll beat the shit outta him.

541
00:49:13,627 --> 00:49:15,880
All right, Dan.

542
00:49:57,546 --> 00:49:59,590
Rigby?

543
00:50:02,092 --> 00:50:04,136
Rigby?

544
00:50:07,056 --> 00:50:09,099
Rigby?

545
00:50:34,416 --> 00:50:36,377
Juliet!

546
00:50:36,502 --> 00:50:40,131
Those dirty bastards!
Beating up a woman.

547
00:50:42,967 --> 00:50:45,803
They even knocked
your breasts out of whack.

548
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,164
Rigby?

549
00:50:49,598 --> 00:50:52,268
Juliet... Are you all right?

550
00:50:52,768 --> 00:50:54,395
0h!

551
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,564
Yes, I'm fine.

552
00:50:57,898 --> 00:51:00,985
You look awful.
- It's all in a day's work.

553
00:51:02,069 --> 00:51:05,389
No, Rigby. It's not worth it.

554
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:10,077
I want you to quit.
- Why? Because I've been roughed up?

555
00:51:10,202 --> 00:51:12,913
You've also been shot and drugged...

556
00:51:13,581 --> 00:51:16,667
...and probably had to go to bed
with women you didn't know.

557
00:51:16,792 --> 00:51:20,296
You're just upset
about me interviewing blondes.

558
00:51:20,421 --> 00:51:22,756
You can forget about it.

559
00:51:35,853 --> 00:51:38,939
I've decided to get
the information myself.

560
00:51:40,983 --> 00:51:43,027
How?

561
00:51:44,945 --> 00:51:47,664
By disguising myself
as a beautiful blonde.

562
00:52:12,389 --> 00:52:15,609
Do I look like a dame?
- Not as much as I do.

563
00:52:15,768 --> 00:52:19,939
I haven't turned on the charm yet.
- Rigby, I wish you'd let me go instead.

564
00:52:20,064 --> 00:52:22,983
Have Neff try and feel you up?
No chance, Dollface.

565
00:52:23,108 --> 00:52:25,861
0h. You don't want
Mr Neff to feel me up?

566
00:52:25,986 --> 00:52:29,365
That doesn't mean you're beginning
to... care for me, does it?

567
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:32,326
I don't want
any of my clients felt up.

568
00:52:32,618 --> 00:52:37,873
I'm late. Neff cruises supermarkets
every Thursday looking for blondes.

569
00:52:37,998 --> 00:52:40,459
If I'm half the woman I think I am...

570
00:52:40,584 --> 00:52:43,254
...I'll have a date with Neff by tonight.

571
00:52:44,296 --> 00:52:46,590
Good luck.

572
00:52:47,466 --> 00:52:51,137
<i>Neff's favourite hunting ground
was Jerry's Market on Melrose.</i>

573
00:52:51,262 --> 00:52:55,099
<i>I spotted him right away and
sidled down the aisle opposite him.</i>

574
00:52:55,224 --> 00:52:58,435
<i>I was wearing a special perfume
called "Fondle Me".</i>

575
00:52:58,561 --> 00:53:02,398
<i>Its aroma drew Neff to me
like fat to a mother-in-law.</i>

576
00:53:05,651 --> 00:53:09,822
<i>He was a ladies' man, all right.
He made me feel beautiful, alive.</i>

577
00:53:10,739 --> 00:53:14,243
<i>He asked me up to his place,
and I didn't play hard to get.</i>

578
00:53:14,368 --> 00:53:16,620
All right.

579
00:53:18,004 --> 00:53:21,701
<i>On his home ground, Neff was
more aggressive and I played along.</i>

580
00:53:25,421 --> 00:53:30,050
I'm crazy about you, baby.
- I'm crazy about you too, Walter.

581
00:53:30,176 --> 00:53:32,428
That perfume on your hair.
What's the name of it?

582
00:53:32,553 --> 00:53:34,346
"Fondle Me".

583
00:53:34,472 --> 00:53:36,515
Silly!

584
00:53:37,099 --> 00:53:39,351
That's the name of the perfume.

585
00:53:40,436 --> 00:53:43,731
I feel like a drink.
- All I've got is bourbon.

586
00:53:44,231 --> 00:53:46,484
I'll make the drinks.

587
00:53:50,112 --> 00:53:52,364
Sit over there.

588
00:54:05,294 --> 00:54:10,132
<i>I wanted to knock him out fast. I slipped
him 15 milligrams of Aphrodisiamil...</i>

589
00:54:10,257 --> 00:54:14,145
<i>... and hoped it would take effect
before he tried to pick my lock.</i>

590
00:54:29,777 --> 00:54:32,988
Sorry, Walter. That's as far
as I go on a first date.

591
00:55:15,573 --> 00:55:18,993
<i>I didn't know what I was looking for,
but what I found was dynamite.</i>

592
00:55:19,118 --> 00:55:22,830
<i>The passenger list of
the Immer Essen's final cruise.</i>

593
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:27,917
<i>It was exactly the same as
the Carlotta "Enemies" list.</i>

594
00:55:28,919 --> 00:55:32,882
<i>One name rang a bell. Cody Jarrett,
captain of the Immer Essen.</i>

595
00:55:33,007 --> 00:55:38,179
<i>I went to the public library and looked
up everything I could on Captain Jarrett.</i>

596
00:55:39,597 --> 00:55:42,433
"Framed Because He Knew Too Much."

597
00:55:42,558 --> 00:55:46,729
"But He Refuses to Divulge What
He Knew to Anyone but His Mother."

598
00:55:47,688 --> 00:55:51,650
<i>I hoped to find out why the passengers
on the Immer Essen's final cruise...</i>

599
00:55:51,775 --> 00:55:54,236
<i>... were being knocked off one by one.</i>

600
00:55:54,361 --> 00:55:57,915
<i>They all must have
seen something. But what?</i>

601
00:55:59,033 --> 00:56:00,242
What do you think?

602
00:56:00,367 --> 00:56:03,120
I think you're beginning to
enjoy dressing up as a woman.

603
00:56:03,245 --> 00:56:06,290
Jarrett's mother's
the only visitor he'll talk to.

604
00:56:06,415 --> 00:56:10,544
And I think I look enough like her
to get a gift on Mother's Day.

605
00:56:23,057 --> 00:56:25,100
Rigby, wait!

606
00:56:26,393 --> 00:56:28,687
Don't... don't call me Rigby.

607
00:56:29,563 --> 00:56:31,857
I'm worried.
Since you were beaten up...

608
00:56:31,982 --> 00:56:36,362
...I've had nightmares about
something awful happening to you.

609
00:56:36,487 --> 00:56:38,948
I care about you, Rigby.

610
00:56:40,908 --> 00:56:43,160
What?

611
00:56:43,285 --> 00:56:45,538
I care about you.

612
00:56:48,749 --> 00:56:51,001
What's the matter?

613
00:56:51,127 --> 00:56:53,546
You. You're the matter.

614
00:56:54,213 --> 00:56:57,341
Did... did I... do something wrong?

615
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:01,137
Yeah. You crept into my gut.

616
00:57:01,262 --> 00:57:05,266
You've got me thinking silly thoughts,
like... hanging up my gun for good.

617
00:57:05,391 --> 00:57:08,018
Becoming a one-woman guy.

618
00:57:08,144 --> 00:57:11,438
Settling down in
an ivy-covered cottage...

619
00:57:11,564 --> 00:57:13,691
...raking the autumn leaves
out of the backyard...

620
00:57:13,816 --> 00:57:16,318
...squeezing orange juice
for you in the morning.

621
00:57:16,444 --> 00:57:18,571
You'd do that for me?

622
00:57:21,365 --> 00:57:23,942
Yeah, I would.
- 0h, Rigby.

623
00:57:59,403 --> 00:58:01,655
Cody Jarrett's mother.

624
00:58:11,165 --> 00:58:13,083
Hello, Ma.

625
00:58:13,918 --> 00:58:16,670
My name is Reardon.
I have important news for you.

626
00:58:16,796 --> 00:58:19,089
So just pretend I'm your ma, 0K?

627
00:58:19,215 --> 00:58:23,636
The paper said you were hit in the head
by a flying wrench in the machine shop.

628
00:58:23,761 --> 00:58:26,806
Friends of Carlotta are after
your head because you know too much.

629
00:58:26,931 --> 00:58:30,476
I see what you mean.
- So the flying wrench was no accident.

630
00:58:30,601 --> 00:58:32,520
For a minute I thought it was.

631
00:58:32,645 --> 00:58:35,606
Something like that
may happen again, so...

632
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:38,943
The guard looks suspicious.
Act like I'm your ma.

633
00:58:39,068 --> 00:58:42,154
Sure.
- Pretend I'm crying. You comfort me.

634
00:58:46,283 --> 00:58:47,910
Relax, Ma.

635
00:58:50,579 --> 00:58:53,874
Say something like, uh,
"No, no, Ma. Look, listen to me."

636
00:58:53,999 --> 00:58:56,252
No, no, Ma. Look, listen to me.

637
00:58:57,962 --> 00:59:00,506
That was good. Real good.

638
00:59:01,215 --> 00:59:04,051
Look, as long as the other
prisoners can get to you...

639
00:59:04,176 --> 00:59:06,887
...you're not safe.
But don't worry, I have a plan.

640
00:59:07,012 --> 00:59:09,557
<i>I contacted Warden Dudley,
who owed me a favour.</i>

641
00:59:09,682 --> 00:59:13,811
<i>I asked him to let me pose as a prisoner
so I could keep an eye on Jarrett...</i>

642
00:59:13,936 --> 00:59:16,147
<i>... maybe learn something about Carlotta.</i>

643
00:59:16,272 --> 00:59:19,984
<i>I learned fast. Jarrett had
a prison break planned that very night.</i>

644
00:59:20,109 --> 00:59:24,697
<i>I was invited along... at gunpoint.
When they stuffed me in the trunk...</i>

645
00:59:24,822 --> 00:59:28,576
<i>... I realised he was a friend
of Carlotta, and I was their enemy.</i>

646
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:33,164
Ryley, you get in the front.
And you, you drive.

647
00:59:34,498 --> 00:59:37,084
<i>I bounced along in that trunk
a long time.</i>

648
00:59:37,209 --> 00:59:42,465
<i>Five hours later, I had given up hope of
ever going to a regular bathroom again.</i>

649
00:59:42,923 --> 00:59:45,801
<i>I decided to have a little chat
with Captain Jarrett.</i>

650
00:59:45,926 --> 00:59:48,387
- Hey, Cody!

651
00:59:53,684 --> 00:59:56,353
How ya doin', partner?
- I can't breathe.

652
00:59:56,479 --> 00:59:58,522
0h. Stuffy, huh?

653
00:59:58,689 --> 01:00:01,150
I'll give you a little air.
- Thanks.

654
01:00:09,074 --> 01:00:13,954
<i>Her lips were warm, and my arm wasn't
the only thing that was throbbing.</i>

655
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:16,415
<i>Our hearts were, too.</i>

656
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:19,877
<i>My plan was to kiss her
with every lip on my face...</i>

657
01:00:20,544 --> 01:00:24,965
<i>... then slowly move her to the next room,
manoeuvre her next to the bed...</i>

658
01:00:25,633 --> 01:00:29,319
<i>... marry her, and start
the whoopee machine.</i>

659
01:00:29,637 --> 01:00:31,680
<i>My plan was working fine until...</i>

660
01:00:31,806 --> 01:00:34,892
Agh! You stuck your finger
in my bullet hole.

661
01:00:35,017 --> 01:00:37,478
Sorry, Rigby.
- I'll be all right.

662
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:41,482
Why don't you lie down?

663
01:00:41,607 --> 01:00:45,528
I'll go to the drugstore
and get you something for your arm.

664
01:00:47,279 --> 01:00:49,949
It's raining too hard.
Call a cab. Hurry back.

665
01:00:50,074 --> 01:00:52,368
I feel like kissing somebody.

666
01:00:52,493 --> 01:00:54,912
Don't start without me.

667
01:01:04,546 --> 01:01:05,339
Hello?

668
01:01:05,464 --> 01:01:07,133
<i>- It's me, Margaret.</i>
Who?

669
01:01:07,258 --> 01:01:09,051
<i>Margaret.</i>
- Margaret?

670
01:01:09,176 --> 01:01:11,762
<i>Margaret Croyden.</i>

671
01:01:11,887 --> 01:01:14,997
Margaret Croyden? I don't believe it!

672
01:01:15,891 --> 01:01:18,936
I don't believe you've called me.
- I should have called sooner...

673
01:01:19,061 --> 01:01:21,522
You shouldn't have called at all.
- It's so quiet here.

674
01:01:21,647 --> 01:01:24,608
0h, Victor's gone for the weekend, huh?

675
01:01:24,733 --> 01:01:26,853
Sorry. Not interested.

676
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:33,159
Because I'm in love. Yeah, really in love.

677
01:01:36,078 --> 01:01:39,766
A few days ago I said something
to a woman I thought I'd never say.

678
01:01:40,541 --> 01:01:44,795
I actually said "I want to settle down
in an ivy-covered cottage with you...

679
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:47,423
<i>... rake the autumn leaves
out of the backyard...</i>

680
01:01:47,548 --> 01:01:50,759
<i>... squeeze orange juice
for you in the morning. "</i>

681
01:01:50,885 --> 01:01:54,013
<i>- I spoke to Victor.
He'll give me the divorce.</i>

682
01:01:54,138 --> 01:01:57,683
<i>I'll tell you what. Come down
tomorrow. We'll drive back together.</i>

683
01:01:57,808 --> 01:02:02,813
<i> Wonderful! I can't wait to
come bouncing back into your life again.</i>

684
01:02:07,002 --> 01:02:09,569
No dice, Margaret.
Call me in another 12 years.

685
01:02:09,645 --> 01:02:10,647
All right, darling.

686
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:49,902
Hello?
<i>- Mr Reardon...</i>

687
01:02:50,027 --> 01:02:52,988
<i>... I have decided to close this case
as of this moment.</i>

688
01:02:53,114 --> 01:02:56,492
A cheque will be in the mail
for you tomorrow.

689
01:02:56,617 --> 01:03:00,371
Please do not try to contact me
as I will be out of town for some time.

690
01:03:00,871 --> 01:03:02,949
Juliet, has someone
got a gun to your head?

691
01:03:04,983 --> 01:03:06,443
Juliet!

692
01:03:10,089 --> 01:03:12,424
<i>A half-bottle of bourbon later
I still couldn't believe it.</i>

693
01:03:12,550 --> 01:03:14,760
<i>Was Juliet crazy like her sister?</i>

694
01:03:14,885 --> 01:03:19,306
<i>Had she fallen in love with the cab
driver on the way to the drugstore?</i>

695
01:03:19,431 --> 01:03:23,519
<i>Or was she a member of the Carlotta
conspiracy and had set me up?</i>

696
01:03:23,644 --> 01:03:27,022
<i>Finally, I arrived at
a very important conclusion.</i>

697
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:29,942
Shit on her!

698
01:03:42,830 --> 01:03:45,291
All dames are alike.

699
01:03:46,834 --> 01:03:50,337
They reach down your throat,
grab your heart... and pull it out.

700
01:03:50,463 --> 01:03:55,134
They throw it on the floor... and
they step on it with their high heels.

701
01:03:55,801 --> 01:04:00,930
They spit on it, shove it in the oven,
then cook the shit out of it.

702
01:04:01,515 --> 01:04:05,185
They slice it into little pieces,
slam it on a hunk of toast...

703
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:07,271
...and they serve it to ya.

704
01:04:07,396 --> 01:04:11,108
They expect you to say
"Thanks, honey, it's delicious."

705
01:04:13,986 --> 01:04:17,198
Well, it's not delicious, Juliet Forrest.

706
01:04:17,323 --> 01:04:19,575
It's rotten.

707
01:04:20,075 --> 01:04:22,661
I don't give a damn
if I ever hear from you again.

708
01:04:28,918 --> 01:04:30,586
Juliet?
- This is Alan.

709
01:04:30,711 --> 01:04:32,838
Alan?

710
01:04:33,506 --> 01:04:37,426
Come on, Marlowe, no games.
- I never could fool you, could I?

711
01:04:38,844 --> 01:04:40,930
No.

712
01:04:41,055 --> 01:04:42,973
Listen, Marlowe.

713
01:04:43,390 --> 01:04:45,768
Juliet left me, and...

714
01:04:46,936 --> 01:04:49,688
...I feel like I've been hit
with a wet frying pan.

715
01:04:49,814 --> 01:04:51,899
How the hell do you pick up the pieces?

716
01:04:52,024 --> 01:04:55,986
I'm beginning to realise it's better
to have something to look forward to.

717
01:04:56,112 --> 01:04:59,073
"Look forward to." Like what? Work?

718
01:04:59,198 --> 01:05:01,117
I can't get a break on this case.

719
01:05:01,242 --> 01:05:03,869
I don't even know who the hell
this Carlotta dame is.

720
01:05:03,994 --> 01:05:06,455
<i>Can you get a map of South America?</i>

721
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:08,966
Yeah. You got something?
- Look up Peru.

722
01:05:13,587 --> 01:05:14,463
Got it!

723
01:05:14,588 --> 01:05:17,466
There's a little town
on the coast called Paita.

724
01:05:17,591 --> 01:05:20,010
<i>Tell me where it is.</i>

725
01:05:22,096 --> 01:05:25,182
It's right next to
a tiny little island called...

726
01:05:25,307 --> 01:05:28,519
You son of a gun! Carlotta!

727
01:05:29,645 --> 01:05:32,022
Damn! It's not a woman's name.

728
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:35,359
It's a place.

729
01:05:35,484 --> 01:05:38,112
Thanks, Marlowe. I owe ya.
- Good.

730
01:05:38,237 --> 01:05:41,240
I'm leaving for Carlotta right now.

731
01:05:41,365 --> 01:05:44,702
Even if Juliet's gone,
I'm gonna solve this case...

732
01:05:44,827 --> 01:05:48,714
...no matter how many killers are
involved, even if Juliet's one of 'em.

733
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:51,709
Any idea where in Carlotta
I should start looking?

734
01:05:51,834 --> 01:05:54,462
<i>There's a little café right on the bay.</i>

735
01:05:55,838 --> 01:06:00,968
<i>When I arrived, I thought of the words
Marlowe had said to me 15 years ago:</i>

736
01:06:01,969 --> 01:06:04,305
<i>"Dead men don't wear plaid."</i>

737
01:06:06,807 --> 01:06:09,143
<i>Dead men don't wear plaid.</i>

738
01:06:10,478 --> 01:06:13,105
<i>I still don't know what it means.</i>

739
01:06:14,190 --> 01:06:18,277
<i>Carlotta was the kind of town where
they spell trouble t-r-u-b-i-l...</i>

740
01:06:18,402 --> 01:06:21,697
<i>... and if you try to
correct them, they kill you.</i>

741
01:06:36,629 --> 01:06:38,714
<i>I knew Marlowe had steered me right.</i>

742
01:06:38,839 --> 01:06:42,676
<i>There was Kitty Collins, the girl
who ditched me in Santa Barbara.</i>

743
01:06:44,970 --> 01:06:47,306
Señor Reardon.

744
01:06:52,561 --> 01:06:54,814
Manuel Alesandro.

745
01:06:58,234 --> 01:07:00,152
Not quite.

746
01:07:00,277 --> 01:07:02,238
Carlos Rodriguez.

747
01:07:04,657 --> 01:07:06,575
Carlos Rodriguez?
- Sí.

748
01:07:06,951 --> 01:07:11,330
Before the war...
we ran guns to the rebels.

749
01:07:12,998 --> 01:07:14,834
0h, yeah.

750
01:07:15,459 --> 01:07:17,378
You're a cop.

751
01:07:17,503 --> 01:07:19,421
Sí, sí, sí.

752
01:07:19,547 --> 01:07:21,482
I have joined the establishment.

753
01:07:23,384 --> 01:07:27,305
That's good, Carlos. I'm here on an
investigation. Maybe you can help me.

754
01:07:28,430 --> 01:07:30,975
There is much to investigate in Carlotta.

755
01:07:31,767 --> 01:07:34,478
The whole island is like a powder keg.

756
01:07:34,603 --> 01:07:38,816
There is much tension, the...
the smell of something rotten.

757
01:07:40,025 --> 01:07:43,946
That's what I'm here for.
To find out what it is that smells.

758
01:07:44,071 --> 01:07:45,656
Psst!

759
01:07:45,781 --> 01:07:50,161
Be careful of the, uh,
fat one who sweats a lot.

760
01:07:52,705 --> 01:07:54,081
What about Kitty Collins?

761
01:07:54,206 --> 01:07:57,543
She doesn't sweat as much,
but she's just as dangerous.

762
01:07:57,668 --> 01:08:00,045
♫ What you want

763
01:08:00,171 --> 01:08:02,214
♫ Everybody wants

764
01:08:06,552 --> 01:08:09,013
They say she is one of them.

765
01:08:09,805 --> 01:08:12,224
Who is..."them"?

766
01:08:12,892 --> 01:08:16,395
Nobody knows.
0nly they know who is "them".

767
01:08:17,271 --> 01:08:21,025
But there is a man.
His name is <i>Arroz</i>. Rice.

768
01:08:22,693 --> 01:08:25,196
Kitty Collins is in love with him.

769
01:08:25,946 --> 01:08:28,282
He is a killer.

770
01:08:28,407 --> 01:08:30,701
Rice, huh?

771
01:08:31,494 --> 01:08:34,596
Thanks, Carlos.
- De nada, señor.

772
01:08:36,123 --> 01:08:39,168
Where are you staying?
- Hotel Guano.

773
01:08:39,293 --> 01:08:42,129
Ha! I'll be in touch.

774
01:08:42,254 --> 01:08:44,715
Cuidado, Señor Reardon.

775
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:48,427
Cuidado, Carlos... Cuidado.

776
01:08:48,552 --> 01:08:52,014
<i>I wanted Kitty Collins
to tell "them" I was in town...</i>

777
01:08:52,139 --> 01:08:55,476
<i>... so I tossed a five-pesetaria coin
into the bowl.</i>

778
01:08:55,726 --> 01:08:58,729
<i>The clank was loud enough
to make her look my way.</i>

779
01:08:59,063 --> 01:09:03,234
<i>That five-pesetaria coin was
the best investment I ever made.</i>

780
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:08,531
<i>The next day, I hooked a big fish:
A fat one who sweats a lot.</i>

781
01:09:11,033 --> 01:09:14,787
Señor?
- Nothing alcoholic. 0h, a beer, maybe.

782
01:09:15,246 --> 01:09:16,914
Sí, señor.

783
01:09:17,790 --> 01:09:20,251
Hard liquor goes to my feet.

784
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:26,506
Just a minute, Mr Rigby.

785
01:09:26,882 --> 01:09:29,826
We know who you are, Mr Rigby.

786
01:09:29,952 --> 01:09:31,812
I'm interested. Who am I?

787
01:09:31,937 --> 01:09:35,332
You could be a guy
who collects $10,000...

788
01:09:35,599 --> 01:09:37,768
...just to leave this stinkin' town.

789
01:09:37,893 --> 01:09:40,963
I could, could I?
- You know who I could be?

790
01:09:42,606 --> 01:09:44,317
Hunchback of Notre Dame?

791
01:09:44,942 --> 01:09:49,447
I could be the guy
who hands ya... them $10,000.

792
01:09:50,364 --> 01:09:53,993
$10,000. Me to you... just like that.

793
01:09:54,118 --> 01:09:58,372
Sorry. My price for leaving
stinking towns is 11,500...

794
01:09:58,497 --> 01:10:01,292
...and a kiss on the lips
from Carmen Miranda.

795
01:10:01,417 --> 01:10:05,296
Pass it on to "them".
Room 204.

796
01:10:06,505 --> 01:10:08,215
Room 204, señora.

797
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:20,186
Come in.

798
01:10:22,021 --> 01:10:25,024
Right on time, Kitty. Been expecting ya.

799
01:10:25,149 --> 01:10:27,401
Thought you'd come last night.

800
01:10:27,526 --> 01:10:30,654
I wasn't thinking too well last night.
- Keep talking.

801
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:33,916
You see, I just
found out something, Rigby.

802
01:10:34,492 --> 01:10:38,496
Who you are, what you do,
and why you're in Carlotta.

803
01:10:38,621 --> 01:10:41,081
I'm here to bust up your game.

804
01:10:44,126 --> 01:10:48,964
I don't get it. A class girl like you
in love with a killer like Rice.

805
01:10:49,089 --> 01:10:51,717
Who... what... why?

806
01:10:51,992 --> 01:10:53,886
When you love someone...

807
01:10:54,011 --> 01:10:57,665
...I guess it doesn't make
any difference who, what or why.

808
01:10:58,390 --> 01:11:00,851
You go right on loving them.

809
01:11:02,978 --> 01:11:05,231
Yeah, you do, don't ya?

810
01:11:06,107 --> 01:11:08,167
I feel as if...

811
01:11:13,155 --> 01:11:15,433
Make me another drink,
will you, baby?

812
01:11:21,146 --> 01:11:22,106
Hello?

813
01:11:22,992 --> 01:11:26,194
What's up, amigo?
- Plenty.

814
01:11:26,401 --> 01:11:29,738
A plane arrived today, and
all the passengers spoke German.

815
01:11:30,283 --> 01:11:33,425
German?
- <i>Mm-hm. Our friend Rice was there.</i>

816
01:11:33,650 --> 01:11:36,237
They gave him a packet.
It was marked today's date...

817
01:11:36,272 --> 01:11:39,286
<i>...and "Final Instructions".</i>
- How do you know all this?

818
01:11:39,431 --> 01:11:43,653
I was hired to protect Rice until he
gets on that plane with Kitty Collins...

819
01:11:43,978 --> 01:11:46,494
<i>... tonight after the Carlotta Festival.</i>

820
01:11:48,106 --> 01:11:49,442
Why are you telling me this, Carlos?

821
01:11:49,567 --> 01:11:52,528
Because the lives of
millions of innocent p...

822
01:11:52,653 --> 01:11:55,030
Carlos? Carlos!

823
01:11:56,157 --> 01:11:57,601
Carlos!

824
01:11:58,725 --> 01:12:00,009
Damn.

825
01:12:07,376 --> 01:12:09,795
Where are you and Rice headed tonight?

826
01:12:10,171 --> 01:12:13,048
What do you know about
a plane with Germermans on it?

827
01:12:13,174 --> 01:12:15,217
Germerm... Germans.

828
01:12:16,093 --> 01:12:18,137
Germermans.

829
01:12:19,096 --> 01:12:22,475
There's a plane with mermans on it.

830
01:12:24,310 --> 01:12:26,645
The plane's in town.

831
01:12:27,938 --> 01:12:30,191
Ethel Merman came in on it.

832
01:12:36,238 --> 01:12:38,783
Wanna go see Ethel Merman with me?

833
01:12:40,326 --> 01:12:42,578
I'll buy two tickets.

834
01:12:42,703 --> 01:12:46,040
Let me get on my pyjamas,
I'll be ready to go.

835
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:49,919
<i>I'd done some brilliant things
in my time.</i>

836
01:12:50,044 --> 01:12:53,564
<i>Asking Kitty Collins to mix me
a drink wasn't one of them.</i>

837
01:12:55,633 --> 01:12:59,720
<i>When I came to, I could make out
only light and shadow at first.</i>

838
01:12:59,845 --> 01:13:03,140
<i>Then I saw an unfamiliar face.
But even in my stupor...</i>

839
01:13:03,265 --> 01:13:07,436
<i>... I knew he was one of the big fish
in the conspiracy: Rice!</i>

840
01:13:07,561 --> 01:13:09,855
Well, I believe
that about winds things up.

841
01:13:10,356 --> 01:13:14,026
I'm gonna wind you up on a rope.
- But you're the one who's gonna die.

842
01:13:14,151 --> 01:13:19,073
Better make it look good. If anything
fishy happens to me, the FBI...

843
01:13:19,198 --> 01:13:20,741
It'll look very natural.

844
01:13:20,866 --> 01:13:25,037
People who know Rigby Reardon
know I'd never die a natural death.

845
01:13:27,081 --> 01:13:29,291
Do you think I'd
leave you around to talk?!

846
01:13:29,416 --> 01:13:31,627
You've already talked too much!

847
01:13:39,484 --> 01:13:40,970
Hold it, Rice!

848
01:13:41,470 --> 01:13:44,849
You're not getting on that plane
tonight. I want those papers.

849
01:13:44,974 --> 01:13:48,521
I'm gonna walk out of this room.
You won't shoot.

850
01:13:48,785 --> 01:13:50,038
I won't?

851
01:13:51,439 --> 01:13:55,901
That was a warning shot, Rice. And I
don't fire as many of 'em as I used to.

852
01:14:09,331 --> 01:14:11,459
Rigby! Señor!

853
01:14:11,584 --> 01:14:13,627
Are you all right? I heard shots.
- I'm all right.

854
01:14:13,752 --> 01:14:16,046
Rice went that way.
- Come on, Carlos!

855
01:14:16,172 --> 01:14:20,009
Are you wearing pyjamas?
Señor, I'll help you take them off.

856
01:14:21,635 --> 01:14:24,346
I don't need help
with my pyjamas! Stop!

857
01:14:24,472 --> 01:14:26,348
Sí.
- Carlos!

858
01:14:26,474 --> 01:14:30,936
Sí. Don't worry about your pyjamas,
señor. I'll take care of them.

859
01:14:31,061 --> 01:14:34,231
0ut of the way!
We are chasing a killer!

860
01:14:34,356 --> 01:14:36,817
Everybody stand back! He's with me.

861
01:14:38,861 --> 01:14:40,988
Coming through!

862
01:14:42,782 --> 01:14:44,533
Señor!

863
01:14:44,658 --> 01:14:46,702
Cuidado, señor. Cuidado!

864
01:14:47,953 --> 01:14:50,623
Stand back!
- Cuidado!

865
01:14:52,249 --> 01:14:54,418
Señor! Your pyjamas!

866
01:14:54,543 --> 01:14:57,129
Forget the pyjamas!

867
01:15:00,341 --> 01:15:02,426
Are you all right?
- It's just a bullet.

868
01:15:02,551 --> 01:15:06,055
My wife Carmelita
will suck it out. Go ahead, señor.

869
01:15:06,806 --> 01:15:11,018
And don't worry about your pyjamas.
I'll take care of them!

870
01:15:59,233 --> 01:16:01,485
"Final Instructions".

871
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:10,327
So that's their game.

872
01:16:19,295 --> 01:16:21,547
"Rasmussen Place".

873
01:16:42,318 --> 01:16:46,572
<i>The last thing I expected to see
was Juliet and her father, alive...</i>

874
01:16:46,697 --> 01:16:50,701
<i>... talking with their butler,
who was dressed in a Nazi uniform.</i>

875
01:16:50,826 --> 01:16:53,370
<i>Yeah. That explained a lot.</i>

876
01:16:53,496 --> 01:16:56,916
<i>Why Juliet was able
to translate German, for one thing.</i>

877
01:16:57,041 --> 01:16:59,335
<i>I'd been played for a sucker.</i>

878
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:02,546
<i>But it wasn't too late
to set things straight.</i>

879
01:17:07,802 --> 01:17:09,678
Yaaah!

880
01:17:12,014 --> 01:17:14,892
0K, everybody! Hands in the air!
0ver on the steps. Let's go!

881
01:17:15,017 --> 01:17:18,854
It's time for a class picture.
Tall ones in back, short ones in front.

882
01:17:19,146 --> 01:17:21,607
Now sit! Hold hands.

883
01:17:22,817 --> 01:17:25,069
Now smile.

884
01:17:25,528 --> 01:17:26,946
That's nice.
- Rigby...

885
01:17:27,071 --> 01:17:30,666
Hold it! Stay where you are,
you dirty, lying Nazi scum.

886
01:17:30,691 --> 01:17:31,784
Rigby!

887
01:17:31,909 --> 01:17:35,162
I should have known. I fell for
a dame who played me for a sucker.

888
01:17:35,287 --> 01:17:37,832
No, Mr Reardon. She did not
play you for a sucker.

889
01:17:37,957 --> 01:17:43,921
I did. Pretending to be a butler, waiting
on inferior races was galling to me.

890
01:17:44,046 --> 01:17:48,092
But I fooled everyone.
- You see, Rigby? I didn't betray you.

891
01:17:48,217 --> 01:17:51,262
How did you know to come here?
- Marlowe told me.

892
01:17:51,387 --> 01:17:54,473
That's how I found Daddy.
I smelled his cheese moulds.

893
01:17:54,598 --> 01:17:56,976
I am sorry to interrupt
such a tender scene...

894
01:17:57,101 --> 01:17:59,562
...but we have a plan to carry out now.

895
01:17:59,937 --> 01:18:04,024
Who are you really, kraut?
- Field Marshal Wilfred von Kluck.

896
01:18:04,150 --> 01:18:06,527
- At your service.
Von Kluck?

897
01:18:06,652 --> 01:18:09,572
Former chief of Hitler's
Special Secret Weapons Corps.

898
01:18:09,697 --> 01:18:12,641
I'm flattered. How did you know?

899
01:18:12,786 --> 01:18:14,827
I figured out
your whole stinking scheme.

900
01:18:14,952 --> 01:18:18,873
How you duped Dr Forrest into helping
you. How you flew in your German agents!

901
01:18:18,998 --> 01:18:21,876
The finest officers in the Führer's army.

902
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:26,005
- Former army.
For the moment.

903
01:18:26,130 --> 01:18:28,048
But we shall rise again.

904
01:18:28,174 --> 01:18:31,218
We'll see about that.
- How did they use Daddy?

905
01:18:31,343 --> 01:18:35,097
Bullet-head here found out your father
had developed a cheese mould...

906
01:18:35,222 --> 01:18:38,768
...so powerful it could decompose
rocks, trees and mountains.

907
01:18:38,893 --> 01:18:42,104
He devised a plan to dissolve
the entire United States.

908
01:18:42,229 --> 01:18:45,994
At first your father unknowingly gave
this swine information because...

909
01:18:46,049 --> 01:18:49,320
- Please, Mr Reardon.
Allow me to tell the story.

910
01:18:49,779 --> 01:18:52,031
- Your father went along...
Mr Reardon.

911
01:18:52,156 --> 01:18:56,660
It is customary in these situations for
the developer of the plan to describe it.

912
01:18:56,786 --> 01:19:01,874
I beg your pardon. It's customary for the
private eye to tell how he figured it out.

913
01:19:01,999 --> 01:19:03,834
No, it is my right!

914
01:19:03,959 --> 01:19:07,755
We were able to dupe Dr Forrest by
posing as a humanitarian organisation...

915
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:11,133
...who planned to wipe out hunger
by ageing cheese faster.

916
01:19:11,258 --> 01:19:15,387
But when he saw what they were doing...
- He assembled lists of our agents...

917
01:19:15,513 --> 01:19:20,351
And seemed about to go to the FBI...
- We had to drug him and bring him...

918
01:19:20,476 --> 01:19:23,562
Here, first faking his death
so there'd be no investigation...

919
01:19:23,687 --> 01:19:26,732
But while testing the mould
on a small island nearby...

920
01:19:26,857 --> 01:19:30,903
The <i>Immer Essen</i> passed by. Some of
the passengers saw the island dissolve...

921
01:19:31,028 --> 01:19:33,697
They were therefore labelled "enemies".

922
01:19:33,823 --> 01:19:36,283
We had Neff cancel
all further tours, and our...

923
01:19:36,408 --> 01:19:40,621
...friends systematically began to
eliminate everyone on that cruise ship!

924
01:19:40,746 --> 01:19:43,207
Schweinehund!
- Jerk!

925
01:19:45,835 --> 01:19:47,586
Now...

926
01:19:48,587 --> 01:19:51,632
...we are ready.
0ur agents have just returned...

927
01:19:51,757 --> 01:19:54,677
...after planting deadly
cheese bombs throughout America.

928
01:19:54,802 --> 01:19:58,264
With America destroyed,
we will win the next war.

929
01:19:58,389 --> 01:20:00,099
And the one after that, too!

930
01:20:00,224 --> 01:20:04,562
When these switches are thrown, your
meddling country will disintegrate...

931
01:20:04,687 --> 01:20:06,689
...like a mouldy hunk of Liederkranz!

932
01:20:06,814 --> 01:20:10,109
Hold the mould, Kluck. Those switches
aren't going to be thrown.

933
01:20:10,234 --> 01:20:14,029
Und I think they will be.

934
01:20:14,155 --> 01:20:16,198
Halt ihn!

935
01:20:19,577 --> 01:20:22,580
Good... good.

936
01:20:24,039 --> 01:20:27,626
I'm sorry to prevent
your becoming a hero, Herr Reardon.

937
01:20:27,751 --> 01:20:31,663
Actually, it is too bad
you and I are on opposite sides.

938
01:20:31,705 --> 01:20:35,050
Because I admire your tenacity.
Under different circumstances...

939
01:20:35,176 --> 01:20:40,639
...I might have even allowed you to live,
perhaps as my, uh... valet, or butler.

940
01:20:41,765 --> 01:20:45,060
And what would you have me
become, Herr Field Marshal?

941
01:20:45,186 --> 01:20:46,979
What?
- I said...

942
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:51,275
...what position could I hold
in your "<i>New 0rder</i>"?

943
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:54,612
Juliet! What are you saying?
He's a Nazi! Don't beg a Nazi!

944
01:20:54,737 --> 01:20:57,323
Would I be your... <i>Reinemachefrau?</i>

945
01:20:57,448 --> 01:21:00,618
Ja, you could, uh... you could be that.

946
01:21:00,743 --> 01:21:03,662
What is that? What is it?!
- Tell him what it means.

947
01:21:03,788 --> 01:21:06,665
<i>Reinemachefrau.
- Rrrreinemachefrau.</i>

948
01:21:08,375 --> 01:21:12,880
It means she could be
my... cleaning woman.

949
01:21:13,255 --> 01:21:15,466
Cleaning woman!

950
01:21:25,518 --> 01:21:27,770
All right, join your pals.
Let's go! Move it!

951
01:21:27,895 --> 01:21:31,273
Great work, Juliet.
Go find Carlos Rodriguez for me.

952
01:21:31,398 --> 01:21:32,733
All right.

953
01:21:32,858 --> 01:21:35,903
Your having that gun
won't stop us, Herr Reardon.

954
01:21:36,028 --> 01:21:39,657
We are a dedicated people,
willing to sacrifice ourselves!

955
01:21:39,782 --> 01:21:43,577
There are only six bullets
in that gun. There are nine of us.

956
01:21:43,702 --> 01:21:47,540
Thus at least three will survive
to throw those switches.

957
01:21:47,665 --> 01:21:50,668
0K.
But who's going to win the lottery...

958
01:21:50,793 --> 01:21:52,879
...and who's going to lose?

959
01:21:55,631 --> 01:21:58,968
Cowards! Fools!

960
01:21:59,802 --> 01:22:01,846
I'll do it myself!

961
01:22:01,971 --> 01:22:03,639
Sorry, pal. You're through.

962
01:22:09,770 --> 01:22:12,440
Not... quite.

963
01:22:16,777 --> 01:22:18,821
At least... we got...

964
01:22:19,488 --> 01:22:23,701
...Terre Haute, India... na.

965
01:22:24,952 --> 01:22:28,747
Damn! They were just about
to get a public library.

966
01:22:29,039 --> 01:22:31,125
Carlos, lock these creeps up.

967
01:22:31,250 --> 01:22:33,169
With pleasure!

968
01:22:33,294 --> 01:22:36,630
0K, creeps. <i>¡Vámonos!</i>  Let's go!

969
01:22:37,548 --> 01:22:39,717
<i>Schweinehunds</i>! Pig dogs!

970
01:22:40,176 --> 01:22:44,305
I pity the Devil the day
you boys start arriving in bunches.

971
01:22:47,933 --> 01:22:51,145
Señor Reardon, when will
you be leaving Carlotta?

972
01:22:52,021 --> 01:22:54,064
Next plane out, Carlos.
- Aha!

973
01:22:54,190 --> 01:22:57,902
That gives me four hours
to wash and press your pyjamas.

974
01:22:58,527 --> 01:23:00,571
No, thanks, Carlos.

975
01:23:01,238 --> 01:23:03,908
I don't think I'll be
needing my pyjamas any more.

976
01:23:10,039 --> 01:23:12,291
What a guy!

977
01:23:25,554 --> 01:23:27,389
What are you... doing?

978
01:23:27,515 --> 01:23:29,433
Adjusting your willie.

979
01:23:29,558 --> 01:23:33,604
When you fell through the window,
it shifted out of whack.

980
01:23:33,729 --> 01:23:36,565
Thanks.
- You're welcome.

981
01:23:37,650 --> 01:23:41,362
<i>I hadn't had my willie
adjusted like that in a long time...</i>

982
01:23:42,029 --> 01:23:44,657
<i>... especially without having to beg.</i>

983
01:23:45,533 --> 01:23:48,119
<i>So there it was - the Carlotta mystery...</i>

984
01:23:48,244 --> 01:23:50,955
<i>... all wrapped up in a neat little bundle.</i>

985
01:23:51,413 --> 01:23:55,417
<i>As I stood there kissing Juliet, I thought
of nothing but hanging up my gun...</i>

986
01:23:55,543 --> 01:23:59,380
<i>... and spending the rest of my days
in that ivy-covered cottage.</i>

987
01:23:59,505 --> 01:24:02,508
<i>Little did I realise
that less than a year later...</i>

988
01:24:02,633 --> 01:24:05,719
<i>... she and I would have
an even more exciting adventure...</i>

989
01:24:05,845 --> 01:24:09,056
<i>... which is coming soon
to your neighbourhood theatre...</i>

990
01:24:09,181 --> 01:24:11,851
<i>... with a possible nude scene by Juliet.</i>
