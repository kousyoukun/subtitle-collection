“躺 槍 真 探 與 中 R 童 顏”                   



yuan18--原創字幕








為什麼我要這樣翻譯片名，你只要傾情欣賞完此片，聯想一下電影情結，就會“撥雲見日”了！！！（順便吐槽一下，原來兩個片名翻譯得毫無喜劇感與此片不搭嘎，真心辣眼睛）

00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:31,888
第二次做電影字幕翻譯，扯蛋打諢而已。































為：此片個性創意剪輯而來，為美女豬腳而go，不帶走一片雲彩，只帶走了顏色，所以此片是黑白的，不信請打10086號碼百事通：）


00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:41,888
順便說一句，本人一直在鎮上，國家四級也沒過，老師幫我過了院四級，就當是“三級”吧。


————扯蛋從畫面出現報紙開始，一會就到，不用快進。

00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:46,888
“躺 槍 真 探 與 中 R 童 顏”

Reardon Detective Agency.</i>
裡格比·里爾頓偵探事務所平靜的一天

slow I was rereading old newspapers.</i>
我宿醉剛醒，沒有生意上門，閑來無事看舊報紙。

<i>I was even thinking of closing
up the office for a few days...</i>
我甚至在想把偵探事務所關門幾天

- That's right.

正式在下！

My name... my...
我芳名...我...
8
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:21,532
<i>In all my years in the business,
I'd never seen anything like her.</i>
行走江湖這麼多年，從未見過這等尤物！

00:03:23,072 --> 00:03:27,532
“天將降大任於斯人也，必將先來一口”

00:03:29,202 --> 00:03:30,632
“一吻定音”plus

00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:54,269
<i>Was she real? There was
only one way to find out.</i>
尼瑪這不是在做夢吧？？只有一個方法能夠檢驗一下。
10
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,394
<i>But I remembered Marlowe's words.</i>
但是這有違馬婁的名言

00:03:58,236 --> 00:04:02,394
don`t fall in love with a client
“不要和客戶成炮友，即便“一見姦情”也不行！

11
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,907
What the hell does Marlowe know?
馬婁懂個毛，他哪見過這等尤物
12
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,742
<i>She was real all right.</i>
她長得太尼瑪正點了，心中陡然無數隻小鹿。
13
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,791
What are you doing?
你在摸我中號咪咪幹嘛？
14
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,413
Adjusting your breasts.
只是你的乳房放進你的胸罩裡而已（星爺來也）。
15
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:22,547
You fainted and they...
shifted all outta whack.
你剛才暈倒了，乳房從胸罩裡跑了出來

You're welcome.

for my dramatic entrance.
謝謝，我很抱歉，剛才進門那戲劇性的一幕

It's just when I saw the...
newspaper headlines...
正好看見報紙的大標題

00:04:47,07 --> 00:04:49,025
（體育版）道奇隊又輸了.

Forrest...
福里斯特....

23
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:16,352
Daughter of the big cheesemaker. You
could use a cup of my famous java.
乳酪大王的千金，你可以來一杯我很滿意爪哇咖啡。
24
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:21,103
Cheese was Daddy's hobby.
He was a scientist.
乳酪是爸爸的愛好。
他是一名科學家。

25
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:25,405
- Quite an accident he had.
- That's what I came to see you about.
超速駕駛意外事故而死，
這就是我來這裡找你的原因。
26
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,653
You don't think it was an accident.
You think he was murdered.
你認為不是意外事故？
你認為是謀殺？
27
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,194
How did you know?
你咋知道？

00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,950
It's my business to know,
Miss Forrest. Sit down.
我靠這個吃飯，
美女先坐下
29
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,872
What makes you think
it wasn't an accident?
你有啥證據嗎？
30
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,677
Just before it... it happened...
就在家父意外死亡之前...
31
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:49,636
he behaved very erratically, writing
out lists of names, dozens of them.
他行為異常，寫了個名單，裡面有數十人
32
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:53,431
He wrote them on blotters and
scratch pads, whatever was handy.
他把它們寫在紙板和便箋，不像順手寫的
33
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:56,515
Here's one of the lists...
or part of one.
這是便箋一個部分
34
00:05:57,565 --> 00:06:00,021
It's from a dollar bill.
來自于一美元的鈔票
35
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:06,483
Somehow I got the feeling he was
the victim of a giant conspiracy.
不知何故，我感覺他是一個巨大陰謀的受害者。
36
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:13,153
You deducted murder and a
giant conspiracy from <i>this?</i>
你自己腦海中演繹的巨大陰謀來自於這個？
37
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,575
You think I'm too impulsive,
don't you, Mr Reardon?
你認為是在受感情驅使嗎？
不是嗎？里爾登先生
38
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,951
Maybe.
可能是
39
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,746
Maybe not.
可能不是

If you want me to investigate your
father's death, I get $10 a day.

Plus expenses.

42
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:34,552
Will $200 be enough in
advance, Mr Reardon?
預支200刀夠了吧？
43
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:38,137
- For $200 I'd shoot my grandmother.
- That won't be necessary.
為200刀我可以去槍殺我的祖母，這玩笑有點過了
44
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:43,350
You never can tell. On my last case, I
had to throw my brother out of a plane.
你永遠不會知道。在我的最後一個案子中，我不得不把我弟弟扔下飛機
45
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,191
Where'd your father keep
his correspondence?
你父親一般在哪裡看信件什麼的？
46
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:50,237
He had a small private office
downtown. Here's the key.
他在市中心有一個小私人辦公室。這是鑰匙
47
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:55,493
Thank you, Mr Reardon.
I appreciate this.
感謝你接手這個案子，真心感謝
48
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,454
- Miss Forrest?
- Yes?
福里斯特小姐。在

49
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:02,499
Save me some shoe leather if you
told me what address this key fits.
如果你告訴我地址，我就能少跑些路
50
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,584
It was 429 Firehouse Row.
429 消防站 羅
51
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:08,386
Pretty seedy part of town
for a renowned scientist.
對於一個著名的科學家來說這小鎮夠破舊的
52
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,429
It was the only place he could
experiment with cheese...
這是家父實驗乳酪的唯一地方
53
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:15,091
without the smell
bothering the neighbours.
不會有氣味騷擾鄰居
54
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,682
I'll see what I can turn up.
我看我會大有作為一番的
55
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:24,319
Good day, Mr Reardon.
祝好
56
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:29,817
<i>On my way to Firehouse Row, I tried
not to think of Juliet Forrest.</i>
在去死者辦公室的路上，我儘量不去想那個“中乳童顏”美女

57
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,693
<i>I hadn't seen a body like that...</i>
但是“中乳童顏”那曼妙的身姿，讓我震精......

58
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:36,073
<i>since I'd solved the case of the
murdered girl with the big tits.</i>
自從上次大山雀案中，救過那個差點被謀殺女孩後
59
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,076

Dr Forrest's cheese lab.</i>
我毫不費力地找到了“中乳童顏”他爹的乳酪實驗室
60
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,535
<i>It smelled like the
number on the door.</i>
它聞起來像門上的號碼
61
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,912
<i>Inside, I turned up
something interesting.</i>
進到裡面，我發現了些有意思的東西。
62
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:53,344
"To John Forrest, a dear man who, like
his cheeses, gets stronger with age."
致親愛的約翰·福里斯特，祝願你像乳酪一樣，老而彌“挺”
63
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,549
"Love, Kitty."
愛人凱蒂
64
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:59,551
So the old renowned scientist
was getting a little on the side.
原來這是著名老科學家的“嫩草枕邊風”
65
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,733

68
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,214
Sounds like company.
有人向這裡走過來了
69
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,893
Exterminator.
害蟲驅除劑推銷
70
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,350
Just a minute.
等一下
71
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,485
Come in.
進來
72
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,823
Sit down.
坐吧
73
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,538
There's some cookies on the table.
那裡有餅乾。
74
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,877
Have one.
來點

00:09:15,052 --> 00:09:19,977
（此人為艾倫·拉德--Alan Ladd，這橋段來自 "This Gun For Hire")
（注：來自“時光網”，這些演員注解找到真尼瑪不容易，時光網還是挺專業的）
75
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,759
Good, aren't they?
味道不錯
76
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:33,151
Guess to be a really good exterminator
you have to enjoy killing things.
猜你是個不錯的害蟲驅除劑推銷員，你必須享受“搞死小強全家老小”

77
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,656
（這個動作，我給12分）

78
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:40,303
- Yes?
- I'd like to see Miss Forrest.
神馬事？
我是來找福里斯特小姐的
79
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,971
- Who shall I say is calling?
- Mr Reardon. Tell her I've been shot.
你是哪個？
老子是大名鼎鼎的躺槍真探——里爾登，告訴她我中彈了
80
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,763
Very good, sir.
好的
81
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:50,265
- May I tell her by whom?
- No. I don't know myself.
我可以告訴她是誰開的槍嗎？不，我都不知道是誰開的槍
82
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:56,023
Are you all right? You look as
though you're going to faint.
你還好嗎？你看起來好像要暈倒了
83
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,611
Faint? Ha!
昏倒？
84
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:01,490
Never.
從來不會
85
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:05,071
- Catch me.
- Sorry.
抓住我，對不起
86
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,209
I'm a butler... not a catcher.
我是男管家，不是接球手

00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,209
—發功準備—
87
00:11:19,044 --> 00:11:20,214
Dollface...
中乳童顏...

00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,714
我靠.難道是傳說中的：“吸星大法，第七重？？”那什麼來著？？？


88
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:26,134
What are you doing?!
我想！我想！我使勁想！

00:11:27,892 --> 00:11:29,888
對！“口到蛋來”？？

89
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,981
It should feel better now.
感覺好點了吧？
90
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,574
- Where'd you learn <i>that?</i>
- At camp.
你在哪學的？？任我行教你的？？

我是在課外活動學的？
91
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:47,662
- You learned that at girls' camp?
- It's really for snakebite, but...
你是在那種專門女孩的營學的？那裡真有被毒舌咬過的，
92
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,914
I find it works for everything.
但是我後來知道這“口活”用途廣泛。
93
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:55,251
You mumbled about Kitty Collins and
Swede Anderson being on a list.
你含糊地自言自語凱蒂·柯林斯和瑞典人安德森在名單上

00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:59,082
- "Friends of Carlotta"?
- That's right. Do you know them?

對了，你認識他們嗎？

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,886
Kitty was...

with after Mother dried up.

were in Santa Barbara.

he works in a gas station...
他曾經是一個拳擊手。現在一個加油站工作
101
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,864
And she sings in a private club.
凱蒂在一個私人俱樂部唱歌
102
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:32,126
You may be interested in this.
I found it in Daddy's study.
你可能對這個感興趣，我在爸爸書房找到的。

- Why?
噓，為毛？
106
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:46,136
No. This.
不是這個意思，上面寫的
107
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:51,345
No, no, no. That's not "Shh."
It's S-H-H. Samuel H Hastings.
不不，不是這個意思，不是噓，是S-H-H，撒母耳·H·赫斯廷斯。

00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,887
My brother-in-law.
Or at least he was.
我妹夫或者至少他曾經是
109
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:57,891

他和我的妹妹李奧娜分開了。他是個爛醉如泥的人

death wasn't an accident.

But what does "FOC" mean?
但是，“操·我”啥意思？

It's a slang word. When a man and a
woman are in love, the man puts his...
這是俚語，當一個男人和女人有姦情是就用這個......

other to a pulp makes me ill.
兩個大男人相互對歐，這種低級趣味讓我感到不舒服。

this being a conspiracy.

for me to handle alone.

I found it in Daddy's desk.
我在我爸的桌子上找到這個。

It looks like a key to one of those
lockers at the train station.
像是火車站儲物櫃的鑰匙

it say on that envelope?

- You understand what it means?
很清楚。
你知道意思了？

a different animal for every year?

你還真聰明。
猶如亞伯拉罕·林肯

Smart can get you killed.

如果是這樣那就對了，我就是好這一口。

was starting to feel something for her.</i>
要是給我機會我會告訴她，我開始感覺到她
250
00:25:43,835 --> 00:25:46,124

on a wife, have a bunch of kids.</i>
但是就我這門在刀尖上行走的職業，不能有妻子和一群孩子。

- What?
我們不會有孩子。
神馬？
253
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:02,135
Look, this is getting us nowhere.
這讓我們無處可去
254
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,895
But thanks anyway.
但還是要謝謝你

coming over here to talk.

You know how to dial, don't you?

You just put your finger in the
hole, and make tiny little circles.

do what I told ya.

your shirt buttoned with no tie.
我討厭你這種煞筆的穿衣方式，襯衫扣上最上面的扣子而不系領帶。

Let me get you a tie.

你惹我生氣了。

I want you to check 'em out.
我想名單上的人都死了。
我想讓你逐一確認一下是不是這樣。

for me, huh? As a favour.
還有，系上這個領節，就當是幫我個忙。

Sorry, Dollface.
對不起，中乳童顏。

我整個晚上都在給你打電話。

- Oh, God!
我猜你是爬回來的。
我來個去！

不，不，我這樣就好。
我來給你抹點酒精。

Sam Hastings is dead.

for a bottle of whisky.
從窗戶上掉下來，伸手去拿一瓶威士卡

He could have been pushed. I'll have
Marlowe check his back for fingerprints.
他可能是被推下去的，我會讓馬婁檢查他的背部的指紋。
355
00:34:20,643 --> 00:34:23,181
- Anything else?
- Yes.
還有別的事嗎？
有
356
00:34:23,313 --> 00:34:26,349
I found another note
Daddy wrote to himself.
我找的了我爸寫的別的紙片

I think it's a New York
license plate number.
我想是紐約車牌的數字

Not bad, Dollface.

有進步，中乳童顏。

幫我看一下：第一頁，第六欄，8月2日的問題

I'll wait.

375
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:31,543
Her? Him.

Yeah... Then read me

啥語言。

00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:01,410
It's also the name of a
South American cruise ship.
這名字好像南美的遊輪在用
384
00:36:01,536 --> 00:36:06,494
I know! When Sam Hastings and my
sister separated last July...

tour on that ship.

Right after that tour, the
company canceled its cruises.

Now Sam Hastings is dead.
可現在撒母耳·黑斯廷掛了。

馬婁，聽我說，現在不要查那些懸而未決的謀殺案了。

Yeah? Why not?
好，為毛？

I got something more important. You
ever had any dealings with Walter Neff?
我現在有更重要的事要你查，你以前與沃爾特·內夫打交道嗎？

American cruise-ship company.

Cruises supermarkets
looking for blondes?

Good. I'll supply the blonde.

One other thing.

If Walter Neff leaves the country,
I may have to take a little boat ride.
如果沃爾特·內夫要離開美國，我可能要跟著去。
403
00:37:37,298 --> 00:37:42,293
If I do, stay off the booze. These
people we're dealing with are killers.
如果我去了，你得戒酒，我們正在對付的這些人可都是殺手
404
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:46,011
Well, thanks for telling <i>me.</i>
Have a nice trip.
感謝你的忠告，旅途愉快。

but thanks anyway. And Marlowe?
我可能不會馬上離開，管他的，但是馬婁？

- Goodbye.
你帶了領帶嗎？
再見

- Marlowe knows Neff.
情況如何？
馬婁知道一下關於內夫的情況。

Says he's a pushover
for beautiful blondes.
正在招金髮尤物。
409
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:04,237
It means we need a female spy.
換句話說我們需要一個女間諜
410
00:38:09,414 --> 00:38:11,407
Why not use me?

411
00:38:16,254 --> 00:38:18,377
Sorry.
呵呵
412
00:38:18,506 --> 00:38:20,879
You're not blonde enough.
你不夠金髮。
413
00:38:33,688 --> 00:38:37,353
- I can always dye my hair.
- No dice, Dollface. You're a client.
我總是染髮。
不行，中乳童顏。你是客戶。
414
00:38:37,484 --> 00:38:42,561
That's one thing I've learned about
clients. Dead ones don't pay their bills.
這是我學到的關於客戶的一件事。死人不付帳單。

415
00:38:46,701 --> 00:38:48,990
Is that all you think of me?
你就是這樣“薄情寡義”的看待我的嗎？
416
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,492
Someone who pays you $10 a day?
一個每日支付你10美元的，又讓你摸過咪咪的人嗎？

00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:56,492
槍不會殺死真探，但與客戶“震情”會！——馬婁

417
00:38:57,837 --> 00:39:01,289
That's right, Dollface. To me
you're just a meal ticket.
是的，中乳童顏，你Y就是我的飯票。
418
00:39:03,718 --> 00:39:06,007
<i>How could I tell her
that I was lying?</i>
我怎麼能告訴她我在撒謊？

419
00:39:06,137 --> 00:39:10,135
<i>I'd work for nothing just to watch
her hair bounce as she walked...</i>
我呆滯的站著只是為看她的頭髮大波浪，如同她行走起來身姿的搖曳...

<i>Smell her creamy skin, cradle
her head on my shoulder.</i>
感受她滑膩的皮膚，當她的頭靠在我的肩上時
421
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:18,139

the curve of her back...</i>
感受她腰部的曲線，背部的曲線
422
00:39:18,274 --> 00:39:22,359
<i>And then gently caress
her two beautiful...</i>
然後輕輕撫摸她的兩個美麗......
（真心意淫無極限——吊絲冰紅茶）
423
00:39:26,991 --> 00:39:29,399
I'm sorry.
對不起。
424
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:32,655
I just don't like being
called a meal ticket.
我只是不喜歡別人叫我飯票
425
00:39:47,929 --> 00:39:52,306
<i>As I started my search for a blonde spy, I
tried to get rid of the image of Juliet...</i>
當我開始尋找一個金髮間諜美女時，我試圖不去想茱麗葉的樣子。
426
00:39:52,434 --> 00:39:56,348
<i>Storming out of my office
with toothpaste on her shoes.</i>
中乳童顏沖出了我的辦公室，鞋上還帶著“intel牙膏廠的牙膏”

427
00:39:58,064 --> 00:40:02,228
<i>First on my list was Monica Stillpond,
a bombshell who once told me...</i>
我的第一選擇是莫妮卡·斯多芬迪，別人告訴我這個狠角色
428
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:07,603
<i>She would do anything for
anybody anywhere at any time.</i>
她可以拳打南帝，腳踢北丐，頭撞東邪，奶翻西毒。


433
00:40:22,339 --> 00:40:24,664
<i>She was in the middle of
a fancy dinner party.</i>
她正在一個華麗的晚宴上。
434
00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:28,844
<i>But I couldn't waste time being
polite. I caught her attention.</i>
但是我沒有把時間浪費在政治演說上，我給她來了個“響指”

00:40:28,864 --> 00:40:31,064
（此人為維羅妮卡·萊克--Veronica Lake，這橋段來自  "The Glass Key" )


435
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:35,841
Coffee will be served in the
living room, Mr Madvig.
咖啡會是在客廳，馬茲維先生
436
00:40:37,062 --> 00:40:42,269
<i>One thing about Monica: The words
"I can't" weren't in her vocabulary.</i>
莫妮卡的一大特點是：有求必應！
437
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,891
Monica, I want you to
do something for me.
莫妮卡，我想讓你去做點事情。
438
00:40:45,028 --> 00:40:47,104
I can't.
我不能
439
00:40:47,238 --> 00:40:51,022
<i>I guess she had added them since
the last time I'd seen her.</i>
我猜她墮落了，自從我上次見過她後。
440
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:56,028
<i>The next one on my list was Doris
Devermont, an old flame of mine.</i>
我的下一個人選是桃莉絲·多沃曼，我的一個老炮友
441

relationship I'd ever had with a woman.</i>
自從我和她搞上就沒有去碰過其他女人
442
00:40:59,959 --> 00:41:04,538
<i>The only thing I'd lied about was my
name. I'd told her I was Teddy Novak...</i>
只是真名我沒有告訴她，我假稱我為泰迪·諾瓦克
443
00:41:04,673 --> 00:41:08,172
<i>So she couldn't track me
down if I got her pregnant.</i>
我是怕她懷孕了，來找我要奶粉錢。


444
00:41:15,433 --> 00:41:17,656
<i>Doris remembered me, naturally.</i>
桃莉絲還記得我
（此人為貝蒂·大衛斯--Bette Davis，這橋段來自  "Deception" )

445
00:41:17,686 --> 00:41:19,643
How do you do, Mr Novak?
過得咋樣，諾瓦克先生？
446
00:41:19,771 --> 00:41:25,014
Mr Novak? No hugs, no kisses? We used
to flop into each other's arms, Doris.
諾瓦克先生？沒有擁抱，沒有親吻，我們可是大戰過300回合的喲，桃莉絲。
447
00:41:25,151 --> 00:41:29,196
Well, don't you think we really ought to
get to know each other all over again?
難道你不認為我們真的應該再次瞭解彼此嗎？
448
00:41:29,322 --> 00:41:33,901
It's only been five years. You were about
to serve me dinner when I had to leave.
這只是五年時光而已。我正要離開你時，你正為我準備晚餐。
449
00:41:34,035 --> 00:41:36,407
How stupid of me.
You must be famished.
我多愚蠢呀，你一定是餓了。
450
00:41:36,538 --> 00:41:40,535
I should have thought of it sooner.
I'll get some coffee and sandwiches.
我早該想到的，我去弄點咖啡，三明治
451
00:41:41,835 --> 00:41:44,242
<i>Coffee and sandwiches.</i>
咖啡，三明治

452
00:41:44,379 --> 00:41:47,546
<i>Now I remembered Doris's
famous stale-bread sandwiches.</i>
我現在想起來了，桃莉絲很擅長做不新鮮的三明治
453
00:41:48,425 --> 00:41:53,383
<i>She'd buy day-old bread, then toast it
to cover up. I wonder if she's changed.</i>
她買不太新鮮的麵包，烤一下，掩蓋一下那股味道，我還以為她改掉這習慣了。
454
00:41:53,513 --> 00:41:56,384
The bread's none too fresh.
Shall I toast it?
麵包不太新鮮，我要烤一下嗎？
455
00:41:57,225 --> 00:42:00,179
No, thanks. I gave up
stale toast for Lent.
謝了，我不要不新鮮的麵包在大齋節時
456
00:42:00,645 --> 00:42:03,219
- Lent?

<i>Same old Doris.</i>
還是那個熟悉的桃莉絲

<i>She used to get smoked turkey
so it would keep for months.</i>
她過去常吃煙熏火雞，這會持續保存幾個月
459
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:12,072
<i>When it finally went bad,
she'd feed it to the maid.</i>
當雞最終變壞時，她會把它給女僕吃
460
00:42:12,198 --> 00:42:16,148
I had some smoked turkey. I guess the
cleaning woman had it for her lunch.
我其實還有一下煙熏火雞，我猜我女傭的當午飯吃了
461
00:42:16,286 --> 00:42:18,528
Oh, here's some p?té.
還有幾塊（法語）
462
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:23,282
Cleaning woman.

Cleaning woman! Cleaning woman!
女傭，女傭
466
00:42:35,055 --> 00:42:37,380
Cleaning woman! Cleaning woman!
女傭！女傭！
467
00:42:53,156 --> 00:42:54,319
Sorry.
對不住。
468
00:42:57,369 --> 00:43:02,363
<i>I was too embarrassed to ask Doris for a
favour after I'd tried to strangle her...</i>
真心太尷尬了，我試圖掐死她，還讓她個忙...
469
00:43:02,499 --> 00:43:05,950
<i>So I went to the next name
in my little black book.</i>
所以我去找下一個人選
470
00:43:06,086 --> 00:43:10,878
<i>The blondest one on my list was a rich
society dame named Jimmi Sue Altfeld.</i>
這是最金髮可人的一個，也是上流社會的女人，傑蜜·蘇·阿特菲
471
00:43:11,007 --> 00:43:15,799
<i>I almost hated to use her - she was so
in love with me, it nearly made me sick.</i>
我其實不願意使用她，她是如此的愛我，愛我到幾乎讓我感到噁心。
472
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:18,336
<i>But business was more important.</i>
但是正所謂“生意如手足，女人如衣服”
473
00:43:18,473 --> 00:43:21,474
<i>I wined her and dined her
at the Plantation Club.</i>
我請她在普蘭泰申俱樂部喝酒吃飯。
474
00:43:21,601 --> 00:43:23,843
<i>Then I made my move.</i>
然後我們離開
475
00:43:25,021 --> 00:43:29,648
Last time we saw each other, I left you
alone sitting at a counter at Schwab's.
我們最後一次見面，我離開你時你一個人坐在施瓦布的櫃檯邊
476
00:43:30,443 --> 00:43:33,646

- You don't hate me for that, do you?
- Of course I don't.
你不生我的氣吧？對嗎？
我沒有
477
00:43:33,988 --> 00:43:35,696
Good...

478
00:43:35,824 --> 00:43:38,493
I'd like to discuss
something with you.

我們現在去哪？
我家
480
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:46,790
<i>There was no way I was gonna
take her home. Her father hated me.</i>
我是不可能去她家的，他爸恨死我了
481
00:43:46,918 --> 00:43:51,212
<i>So I told her to meet me at a motel and
I'd show her something with my hands.</i>
所以，我讓她來旅館和我見面，我個她表演“手影秀”

00:44:23,747 --> 00:44:25,988
Come in.
進來

00:44:26,007 --> 00:44:30,188
（此人為拉娜·特納--Lana Turner，這橋段來自  "The Postman Always Rings Twice" )


483
00:44:30,378 --> 00:44:32,252
Well, Jimmi Sue, you ready?
好了，可人兒，準備好了嗎？
484
00:44:33,173 --> 00:44:35,580
What are we going to do?
我們接下來做神馬？
485

Kinsey from cover to cover.
做點成人該做的壞事。

Has anyone ever told you that your lips
are like two succulent Brussels sprouts...
有人說過你的雙唇像多汁的布魯塞爾幼芽嗎？
487
00:44:59,282 --> 00:45:03,410
- ...waiting to be buttered and bitten?
- Plenty of men have.
需要黃油滋潤和輕咬
很多男人都有

Have these men ever told you...

00:45:09,709 --> 00:45:14,585
that your eyes are like Chinese coins
with dollops of caviar in the center?
你的眼睛像中國錢幣帶著塊魚子醬色的中心？
491
00:45:14,714 --> 00:45:17,205
Can't you see how happy
you and I would be here?
你看不出有多幸福嗎？
你和我在這裡？
492
00:45:17,342 --> 00:45:21,803
Yes, I do. But I want you to come
back to the city with me first.
是的，我能感受到，但是我希望你和我先回到城裡。
493

dangerous, and you'll probably be killed.
我手裡有一個重要的案子，很危險，你也可能被殺.

但是，如果你愛我的話，你會去的。
是的，我愛你。

00:45:31,022 --> 00:45:36,527
And I love you. And I mean that more
than anything I've ever said in my life.
我愛你，勝過愛我自己的生命。


00:45:43,022 --> 00:45:47,527
這是什麼鬼指型？——六脈神劍？？


496
00:45:47,872 --> 00:45:52,748
<i>I rented an apartment and started giving
Jimmi instructions on how to pump Neff.</i>
我租了一套公寓，開始給傑蜜介紹內夫的情況
497
00:45:52,877 --> 00:45:55,914
<i>She took direction like
a pig takes to garbage.</i>
她根本就不是做女間諜的料。
498
00:45:56,047 --> 00:45:58,123
Here's a picture of our Mr Neff.
這是內夫的照片
499
00:45:58,258 --> 00:46:00,927
Do, uh, whatever you have to...
哦，無論如何你必須

To find out what happened
on the <i>Immer Essen.</i>
找出在伊默·埃森號上發生了什麼

Your father threatened to have me
beat up if I continue to see ya.
你父親威脅要修理我，如果我繼續和你搞在一起。
502
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:11,266
Thought I'd drop over there tomorrow
with a little peace offering.
我想明天我會用點和平的方法來解決這個問題。
503
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:13,769
What could I take
that'd soften him up?
我能拿什麼來軟化他？
504
00:46:13,898 --> 00:46:16,354
He never had a dog
when he was a boy.
他小時候從來沒有養過狗。
505
00:46:17,235 --> 00:46:19,477
Never had a dog, huh?
從來沒有養過狗？

00:46:20,835 --> 00:46:23,877
（此人為愛德華·阿諾德--Edward Arnold，這橋段來自  "Johnny Eager" )

Mr Altfeld?
阿特菲爾德先生？
507
00:46:35,295 --> 00:46:37,667
Totally house-broken.

His name is... Ramon.
他名字叫，雷蒙
509
00:46:41,676 --> 00:46:43,918
He's yours.
他是你的了
510
00:46:49,768 --> 00:46:52,223
Get out, thief!
滾出起，小偷
511
00:46:52,354 --> 00:46:57,099
I'm not stealing your daughter. I'm just
borrowing her for an important case.
我不是來偷走你女兒的，我是借她來辦一個案子的。
512
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:02,989
Don't go near my daughter. Don't try to
see her. Don't write and don't phone.
不准你靠近她！看她！寫信給她！打電話給她！反正不准！
513
00:47:03,114 --> 00:47:05,819
Can I use her underwear
to make soup?
那我可以拿她的內衣內褲煮湯嗎？
514
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:08,441
- Get out!
- Mr Altfeld...
鬼出去！
阿特菲爾德先生...

515
00:47:08,578 --> 00:47:11,662
By helping me, your
daughter's life is in danger.
在幫助我時，你女兒的生命處於危險之中。
516
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:15,455
But she may save hundreds of lives.
You wouldn't stand in the way of that.
但是她可能會挽救上百條生命。你不能這樣斷人活路
517
00:47:15,585 --> 00:47:17,625
Why certainly I would!
我一定會的
518
00:47:17,921 --> 00:47:22,464
I'd frame you or kill you... if
it would protect my daughter.
老子弄死你就是為了保護好我女兒。
519
00:47:23,301 --> 00:47:27,548
And I brought you a puppy,
something you never had as a boy.
我買了小狗，是為了打動你。
520
00:47:27,681 --> 00:47:29,922
Now get out!

00:47:30,558 --> 00:47:33,014
Come on, Ramon.

00:47:35,313 --> 00:47:37,389
You don't deserve a puppy.
你不配養這小狗
523
00:47:39,234 --> 00:47:41,025
Wait!
站住
524
00:47:42,278 --> 00:47:44,520
Pick that up.
把這個撿走
525
00:47:45,907 --> 00:47:49,110
- But it's all soft and steamy.
- Pick that up!
但是這又軟又濕。
趕緊撿走
526
00:47:52,163 --> 00:47:54,619
You're a sick man, Altfeld.
你真尼瑪讓人噁心，阿特菲爾德
527
00:48:02,173 --> 00:48:06,919
You can make me pick up dog dirt, but
you can't stop me seeing Jimmi Sue.
你能讓我撿走狗屎，但是不能讓我不去見你女兒。
528
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:16,266
- You want a puppy?
- I'd love a dog.
你想要這只小狗嗎？
我就是喜歡小狗。
529
00:48:17,272 --> 00:48:19,015
Thank you.

謝謝
531
00:48:24,446 --> 00:48:25,525

Well, Larry, Moe and Curly.
這尼瑪好，拉裡，莫伊，克雷

Thanks, Dan.
謝了，丹
534
00:48:40,628 --> 00:48:43,546
Not a nice way to treat a friend
of Mr Altfeld's daughter.
這不是對待阿特菲爾德女兒盆友的友好方法。
535
00:48:43,673 --> 00:48:45,832
There's only one way to treat <i>you.</i>
這裡只有一種方法對待你。
536
00:48:50,138 --> 00:48:52,427
You got some pretty
smart monkeys here.
這裡有一些很聰明的猴子

537
00:48:54,893 --> 00:48:58,392
I notice this one's wearing
a Phi Beta Kappa key here.
我注意到在這這裡有一個穿著a Phi Beta Kappa key的。
538
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:04,857
- Ow!
- Your move.
去
該你放大招了。
539
00:49:04,986 --> 00:49:07,524
I'm gonna have some
sense beaten into you.
我會有些懲罰你快感。
540
00:49:08,365 --> 00:49:12,694
What's he payin' you boys? I'll double
it and we'll beat the shit outta him.
什麼是他給你的孩子？我會雙倍給你，我們一起圍毆這個煞筆，然後你們跟我混。
541
00:49:25,027 --> 00:49:29,569
瞬間變長鼻子哥哥！！！

00:49:33,127 --> 00:49:41,069
果然是“躺槍真探”，罵要還口，打不還手，混你妹了。

00:49:45,127 --> 00:49:50,069
最後來個“渾身清蒸黃燜”的。

542
00:49:56,746 --> 00:49:58,786
Rigby?
裡格比
543
00:50:01,292 --> 00:50:03,332
Rigby?
裡格比
544
00:50:06,056 --> 00:50:07,095
Rigby?
裡格比

00:50:10,156 --> 00:50:13,295
我去，“廬山升龍霸”盲狙炮友，幹的漂亮，加10分。

545
00:50:33,616 --> 00:50:35,574
Juliet!
茱麗葉
546
00:50:35,702 --> 00:50:39,320
Those dirty bastards!
Beating up a woman.
骯髒的混蛋還毆打女人。
547
00:50:42,167 --> 00:50:45,002
They even knocked your
breasts out of whack.
他們甚至把你的中號咪咪震出胸罩了。
548
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,960
Rigby?
裡格比
549
00:50:48,798 --> 00:50:51,468
Juliet... Are you all right?
茱麗葉，你沒事吧？
550
00:50:51,968 --> 00:50:53,593
Oh!

551
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,759
Yes, I'm fine.
沒事
552
00:50:57,098 --> 00:51:00,183
- You look awful.
- It's all in a day's work.
你看起來極壞了。
是呀 ，整天都在忘我的查案。
553
00:51:01,269 --> 00:51:04,187
No, Rigby. It's not worth it.
不能這樣，裡格比，不值得！
554
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:09,274
- I want you to quit.
- Why? Because I've been roughed up?
我想你不要查這個案子了。
為毛？因為我剛被群毆了？
555
00:51:09,402 --> 00:51:12,107
You've also been
shot and drugged...
你是被躺槍，又是被下迷藥....
556
00:51:12,781 --> 00:51:15,865
And probably had to go to bed
with women you didn't know.
你還可能和你不認識女人炮戰一百回合不下火線。
557
00:51:15,992 --> 00:51:19,491
You're just upset about
me interviewing blondes.
你現在還在擔心我和我要面試的金髮美女約炮。
558
00:51:19,621 --> 00:51:22,946
You can forget about it.
少吃點地溝油，少操點中南海的心，好吧。

00:51:25,621 --> 00:51:31,946
（以前也抽煙，這招可是點煙神技哦）

559
00:51:35,053 --> 00:51:38,137
I've decided to get the
information myself.
我會自己去搞資訊的。
560
00:51:40,183 --> 00:51:42,223
How?
如何搞？
561
00:51:44,145 --> 00:51:46,553
By disguising myself
as a beautiful blonde.
去趟泰國，立馬搞定。
562
00:52:11,589 --> 00:52:14,507
- Do I look like a dame?
- Not as much as I do.
我像個美女嗎？
有點吧
563
00:52:14,968 --> 00:52:19,131
- I haven't turned on the charm yet.
- Rigby, I wish you'd let me go instead.
我還沒有開啟魅力發騷模式。
裡格比，我希望你能讓我去
564
00:52:19,264 --> 00:52:22,181
Have Neff try and feel you up?
No chance, Dollface.
讓內夫盡情的上你？
沒可能，中乳童顏。
565
00:52:22,308 --> 00:52:25,060
Oh. You don't want
Mr Neff to feel me up?
你不想讓內夫上我？
566
00:52:25,186 --> 00:52:28,555
That doesn't mean you're beginning
to... care for me, does it?
換句話說就是你想獨霸我了，不是嗎？
567
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:31,525
I don't want any of
my clients felt up.
我不想和我的客戶“七上八下”
568
00:52:31,818 --> 00:52:37,061
I'm late. Neff cruises supermarkets
every Thursday looking for blondes.
我要完了，內夫遊輪超市在每星期四招聘金髮美女
569
00:52:37,198 --> 00:52:39,654
If I'm half the woman
I think I am...
如果有一點女人味的話，我想
570
00:52:39,784 --> 00:52:42,454
I'll have a date with
Neff by tonight.
我會和內夫在今晚約會
571
00:52:43,496 --> 00:52:45,785
Good luck.
祝你好遠。
572
00:52:46,666 --> 00:52:50,331
<i>Neff's favourite hunting ground
was Jerry's Market on Melrose.</i>
內夫最喜歡約炮的地方是在梅爾羅斯的傑裡的大市場
573
00:52:50,462 --> 00:52:54,294

down the aisle opposite him.</i>
我認出他了，並馬上移向他對面的過道
574
00:52:54,424 --> 00:52:57,627
<i>I was wearing a special
perfume called "Fondle Me".</i>
我用了一種叫：“愛撫我”的香水
575

不要再來聯繫我，我會馬上離開這裡

01:03:00,071 --> 01:03:02,942
Juliet, has someone got
a gun to your head?
茱麗葉，有人用槍威脅你嗎？
691
01:03:03,783 --> 01:03:05,242
Juliet!
茱麗葉
692
01:03:09,289 --> 01:03:11,708
<i>A half-bottle of bourbon later
I still couldn't believe it.</i>
悶著喝了半瓶波旁威士卡後，我還是無法相信這個突變

<i>Was Juliet crazy like her sister?</i>
茱麗葉被剛才的大雨淋感冒而瘋掉了？就像她那個失心瘋妹妹？
694
01:03:14,085 --> 01:03:18,498
<i>Had she fallen in love with the cab
driver on the way to the drugstore?</i>
還是在去雜貨店的路上和計程車司機“車震定情”了
695
01:03:18,631 --> 01:03:22,712
<i>Or was she a member of the Carlotta
conspiracy and had set me up?</i>
或是她是卡洛塔的陰謀中的一員，專門過來玩弄我的感情的？

<i>Finally, I arrived at a
very important conclusion.</i>
最終我得出了一個重要的結論。

Shit on her!
我去她娘親的！
698
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:44,485
All dames are alike.
所以女人都善變，都來自於泰坦星球。
699
01:03:46,034 --> 01:03:49,533
They reach down your throat,
grab your heart... and pull it out.
她們把手伸到你的喉嚨，抓住你的心房…把它拔出來。
700
01:03:49,662 --> 01:03:54,324
They throw it on the floor... and they
step on it with their high heels.
她們把它扔在地板上…用高跟鞋踩著它。
701
01:03:55,001 --> 01:03:59,129
They spit on it, shove it in the
oven, then cook the shit out of it.
她們吐口水在上面，把它推到烤箱裡，然後把它拿出來煮。
702
01:04:00,715 --> 01:04:03,882
They slice it into little pieces,
slam it on a hunk of toast...
她們把它切成小塊，鋪滿一大塊麵包
703
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:06,466
And they serve it to ya.
然後給你吃。
704
01:04:06,596 --> 01:04:10,297
They expect you to say "Thanks,
honey, it's delicious."
她們希望你說“謝謝”，
親愛的，很好吃
705
01:04:13,186 --> 01:04:16,389
Well, it's not delicious,
Juliet Forrest.
嗯，但這不好吃，
茱麗葉·福里斯特
706
01:04:16,523 --> 01:04:18,765
It's rotten.
是臭的。
707
01:04:19,275 --> 01:04:21,849
I don't give a damn if
I ever hear from you again.
如果我能再聽到你的聲音，我一點也不在乎。
708
01:04:28,118 --> 01:04:29,778
- Juliet?
- This is Alan.
茱麗葉?
艾倫
709
01:04:29,911 --> 01:04:32,034
Alan?
艾倫？
710
01:04:32,706 --> 01:04:36,620
- Come on, Marlowe, no games.
- I never could fool you, could I?
不要這樣，馬婁，不要開玩笑。
我以前有欺騙你，我有嗎？
（此人為亨弗萊·鮑嘉--Humphrey Bogart，這橋段來自 "archive footage")

712
01:04:40,255 --> 01:04:42,164
Listen, Marlowe.
好好聽著，馬婁
713
01:04:42,590 --> 01:04:44,963
Juliet left me, and...
茱麗葉剛剛棄我而去....
714
01:04:46,136 --> 01:04:48,887
I feel like I've been hit
with a wet frying pan.
我心如壓路機壓過一樣
715
01:04:49,014 --> 01:04:51,090
How the hell do you
pick up the pieces?
你是怎麼應對這種情況的？
716
01:04:51,224 --> 01:04:55,174
I'm beginning to realise it's better
to have something to look forward to.
要是我的話，我就馬上向前看。
717
01:04:55,311 --> 01:04:58,265
"Look forward to." Like what? Work?
向前看？用工作來抵消過去？
718
01:04:58,398 --> 01:05:00,307
I can't get a break on this case.
我不能對這個案子中途而廢
719
01:05:00,442 --> 01:05:03,063
I don't even know who the
hell this Carlotta dame is.
我甚至不知道誰是卡洛塔夫人。
720

<i>Can you get a map of South America?</i>
你手上有南美的地圖嗎？
721
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:08,354

the coast called Paita.

little island called...

You son of a gun! Carlotta!

Damn! It's not a woman's name.
該死！這不是女人的名字。
728
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:34,548
It's a place.

- Good.
謝了，馬婁，我欠你一個人情。

I'm leaving for Carlotta right now.

gonna solve this case...
即使茱麗葉走了，我也要解決這個案子
732
01:05:44,027 --> 01:05:48,107
No matter how many killers are
involved, even if Juliet's one of 'em.
不管有多少殺手在那兒等著，即使中乳童顏也是他們的殺手。
733
01:05:48,239 --> 01:05:50,909
Any idea where in Carlotta
I should start looking?
在卡洛塔有什麼線索需要我去查嗎？

right on the bay.</i>
在海灣右邊有個小咖啡館

當我到達的時候，我想起了，馬婁在15年前曾對我說過的話。

我至今不能理解其意。
740

they spell trouble T-R-U-B-I-L...</i>
卡洛塔是混雜著各種麻煩的城市
741
01:06:17,602 --> 01:06:20,888

them, they kill you.</i>
如果你想改變這一切，那你就玩完了。

steered me right.</i>
馬婁有操控我的權利。

who ditched me in Santa Barbara.</i>
是凱蒂·柯林斯，那個在聖巴巴拉逃避我的女孩

I have joined the establishment.
我加入了當權派

很好，卡洛斯，我來這裡是為了調查一個案子，也許你能助我一臂之力。

There is much to
investigate in Carlotta.

The whole island is
like a powder keg.

the smell of something rotten.
這裡氣氛緊張，彌漫著腐爛的味道。

find out what it is that smells.

What about Kitty Collins?
凱蒂·柯林斯是啥貨色？

She doesn't sweat as much,
but she's just as dangerous.
她並不是看起來那樣“甜美可口且水多如注”，反倒是危險角色。

They say she is one of them.

Who is... "them"?

know who is "them".

tell "them" I was in town...</i>
我想在城裡，要凱蒂·柯林斯告訴我關於“他們”是什麼

coin into the bowl.</i>
所以我打賞5個pesetaria硬幣。

to make her look my way.</i>
想讓硬幣落入碗中的叮噹聲吸引她的注意並向我這邊看。

best investment I ever made.</i>
5個pesetaria硬幣是我能做的最好投資

01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:19,445
Hard liquor goes to my feet.
烈酒流來，我為何要拒。
785
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:25,204
Just a minute, Mr Rigby.

We know who you are, Mr Rigby.

I'm interested. Who am I?

hands ya... them $10,000.
我可能是那個給你1萬美刀的那個人

just like that.
1萬美刀，我給你，如此輕鬆

Sorry. My price for leaving
stinking towns is 11,500...
對不起，我離開臭城鎮的代價是11,500...
795
01:09:57,697 --> 01:10:00,484
And a kiss on the lips
from Carmen Miranda.
外加要和卡門·米蘭達“唇戰舌綿震春曉”

01:10:00,617 --> 01:10:04,484
Pass it on to "them". Room 204.

Thought you'd come last night.

我昨晚有個不太好的感覺。

You see, I just found
out something, Rigby.
裡格比，我發現了些問題。

01:10:33,692 --> 01:10:37,689
Who you are, what you do,
and why you're in Carlotta.
你是哪個？想幹什麼？為什麼要來卡洛塔
804
01:10:37,821 --> 01:10:40,276
I'm here to bust up your game.
我來這裡結果你
805
01:10:43,326 --> 01:10:48,154
I don't get it. A class girl like you
in love with a killer like Rice.
我想不明白，像你這樣優雅端莊的女孩為毛會喜歡一個像賴斯這樣的殺手。

When you love someone...
當你真愛某人時

difference who, what or why.

You go right on loving them.

01:20:18,777 --> 01:20:21,778
Good... good.
好的，做的好
937
01:20:23,239 --> 01:20:26,822
I'm sorry to prevent your
becoming a hero, Herr Reardon.
里爾頓先生，很抱歉，不能讓你成為大英雄了！
938
01:20:26,951 --> 01:20:30,403
Actually, it is too bad you
and I are on opposite sides.
事實上，你和我站在對立面上太糟糕了。
939

I admire your tenacity. Under
different circumstances...
我佩服你的堅韌。在不同的情況下...
940
01:20:34,376 --> 01:20:39,832
I might have even allowed you to live,
perhaps as my, uh... valet, or butler.
我甚至可以讓你活下去，也許是我，呃…當我的男僕，或者管家.
941
01:20:40,965 --> 01:20:44,251
And what would you have me
become, Herr Field Marshal?
你會讓我成為什麼，陸軍元帥先生？
942
01:20:44,386 --> 01:20:46,177
- What?
- I said...
什麼？
我是說...
943
01:20:46,304 --> 01:20:50,468
What position could <i>I hold
in your "New Order"?</i>
在你的新秩序中我能擔任什麼位置？
944
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:53,803
Juliet! What are you saying?
He's a Nazi! Don't beg a Nazi!
茱麗葉！你在亂說啥？
他是納粹，不要乞求納粹！

01:20:53,937 --> 01:20:56,510
Would I be your... <i>Reinemachefrau?</i>
或許我能成為你的...（德語-女傭）
946
01:20:56,648 --> 01:20:59,815
<i>Ja,</i> you could, uh...
you could be that.
對，你可能成為那樣。
947
01:20:59,943 --> 01:21:02,860
- What is that? What is it?!
- Tell him.
說啥毛線？神馬呀！
告訴他！
948
01:21:02,987 --> 01:21:05,858
<i>- Reinemachefrau.
- Rrrreinemachefrau.</i>
（德語-女傭）

949
01:21:07,575 --> 01:21:12,072
It means she could be
my... cleaning woman.
意思就是，她將成為女傭.
950
01:21:12,455 --> 01:21:14,662
Cleaning woman!
女傭!
951
01:21:24,718 --> 01:21:26,959
All right, join your pals.
Let's go! Move it!
到你的朋友那邊去，快過去，馬上！
952
01:21:27,095 --> 01:21:30,464
Great work, Juliet. Go find
Carlos Rodriguez for me.
做的不錯，茱麗葉，去幫我找卡洛斯·羅德里格斯來這裡。
953
01:21:30,598 --> 01:21:31,927
All right.
好的。
954
01:21:32,058 --> 01:21:35,095
Your having that gun won't
stop us, Herr Reardon.
里爾頓先生，你槍裡的子彈不足以全部殺死我們。
955
01:21:35,228 --> 01:21:38,846
We are a dedicated people,
willing to sacrifice ourselves!
我們都是獻身的人，願意犧牲自己！
956
01:21:38,982 --> 01:21:42,766
There are only six bullets in
that gun. There are nine of us.
你槍裡只有6顆子彈，我這裡卻有9個人。
957
01:21:42,902 --> 01:21:46,734
Thus at least three will survive
to throw those switches.
因此，至少有三個人將生存下來去打開這些開關。
958
01:21:46,865 --> 01:21:49,866
OK. But who's going
to win the lottery...
好啊.但是誰會贏得彩票...
959
01:21:49,993 --> 01:21:52,566
And who's going to lose?
誰會輸？
960
01:21:54,831 --> 01:21:58,165
Cowards! Fools!
懦夫！傻瓜！
961
01:21:59,002 --> 01:22:01,041
I'll do it myself!
我親自來打開！
962
01:22:01,171 --> 01:22:02,831
Sorry, pal. You're through.
對不起，夥計。你走遠了！！
963
01:22:08,970 --> 01:22:11,639
Not... quite.

Terre Haute, India... na.
特雷霍特，印度...

01:22:24,152 --> 01:22:27,438
Damn! They were just about
to get a public library.
該死的！世界地圖要換了（他們馬上去弄一個公共圖書館）。
967
01:22:28,239 --> 01:22:30,315
Carlos, lock these creeps up.
卡洛斯，把害蟲們都銬起來。
968
01:22:30,450 --> 01:22:32,359
With pleasure!
馬上辦！
969
01:22:32,494 --> 01:22:35,827
OK, creeps. <i>? Vámonos!</i> Let's go!
好吧！害蟲們！都出去！
970
01:22:36,748 --> 01:22:38,906
<i>Schweinehunds!</i> Pig dogs!
豬狗不如的東西！
971
01:22:39,376 --> 01:22:43,504
I pity the Devil the day you
boys start arriving in bunches.
我同情惡魔的那一天，就會讓你們的孩子成群結隊的來探望你們。
972
01:22:47,133 --> 01:22:50,337
Se?or Reardon, when will
you be leaving Carlotta?
里爾頓，你要啥時候離開卡洛塔？
973
01:22:51,221 --> 01:22:53,260
- Next plane out, Carlos.
- Aha!
下班飛機吧，卡洛斯。
哈！
974
01:22:53,390 --> 01:22:57,090
That gives me four hours to
wash and press your pajamas.
給我四個小時清洗你的睡衣。
975
01:22:57,727 --> 01:22:59,767
No, thanks, Carlos.
謝謝，不用了，卡洛斯。

976
01:23:00,438 --> 01:23:03,108
I don't think I'll be needing
my pajamas any more.
我想我不再需要睡衣了。
977
01:23:09,239 --> 01:23:11,481
What a guy!
好一個真性情！
978
01:23:24,754 --> 01:23:26,581
What are you... doing?
你想做...神馬？
979
01:23:26,715 --> 01:23:28,624
Adjusting your willie.
只是調整一下你小雞雞的角度而已。（片子前後照應哦！）
980
01:23:28,758 --> 01:23:32,803
When you fell through the window,
it shifted out of whack.
當你從窗戶跳進來時，你小雞雞就被猛震了一下，擺的位置不受用。
981
01:23:32,929 --> 01:23:36,254
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
謝謝.

這樣就更對我妹妹的口味了！

982
01:23:36,850 --> 01:23:45,550
下面都是裡格比·里爾頓前面對中乳童顏說過了的煽情屁話了，我就不翻譯了，劇透一下：這兩人會互“啃”很久且是同一個姿勢，沒啥觀賞性，不如看下我的另外一個原創字幕電影廣告。

01:23:46,150 --> 01:23:58,550
我做的第一部電影字幕：《不簽名的造偽者-英簡雙語-yuan18-原創字幕-絕命大逃亡》Incognito.1997.DVDRip.XviD-VH-PROD——“偽造倫勃朗油畫的驚險動作片，其中也有一位法國女神，不是蘇菲·瑪索哦！”，有興趣盆友可以到國內各大字幕站搜索，注釋“yuan18”的就是我的版本。

01:23:59,850 --> 01:24:15,550
最後，如果有翻譯不對之處，可以Email指正：fasf163@163.com，或者在http://subhd.com搜索該片，給我留言：）

01:24:16,081 --> 01:24:21,051
        “躺 槍 真 探 與 中 R 童 顏”  
                 
      
yuan18--原創字幕（翻譯，字幕軸，校對都是我哦：））

           
                （完）
