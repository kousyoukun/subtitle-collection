1
00:00:58,977 --> 00:01:00,437
You're all better now.

2
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:02,856
You're safe.

3
00:02:43,623 --> 00:02:45,166
What do you think? The black one?

4
00:02:50,213 --> 00:02:53,091
Where in the fu--

5
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:56,928
heck is your daddy?
Should we go find him?

6
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:01,933
Daddy? Where are you?

7
00:03:13,778 --> 00:03:17,156
Now? Hello?

8
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:20,410
- You chose now to do this?
- Oh, hey.

9
00:03:20,493 --> 00:03:23,788
<i>Gordita.</i> Come to Papa.

10
00:03:23,872 --> 00:03:25,999
Even though you shouldn't be here.

11
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,377
It's too dusty for you.

12
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,672
Daddy's the only one who gets to hide away
in this man cave of his.

13
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:33,756
I know.

14
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,091
You going somewhere?

15
00:03:38,011 --> 00:03:39,804
No, we are going somewhere.

16
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:42,724
Yeah, no. I'm ready.

17
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:58,740
You know what? I'm sorry, okay?

18
00:03:58,823 --> 00:04:00,408
I'm sorry I forgot our date night.

19
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:01,951
Forget it.

20
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:12,462
Could you please just not sigh?

21
00:04:12,545 --> 00:04:15,131
Really? Okay.

22
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:18,468
You don't honestly expect me to believe
that you forgot your own argument

23
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:21,346
about how date night was cheaper
than therapy, do you?

24
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:25,099
Right, like you forgot we agreed your mom
wasn't allowed in our house anymore.

25
00:04:25,183 --> 00:04:28,269
We're broke. I don't see you
finding a free babysitter.

26
00:04:28,353 --> 00:04:30,688
I would have. What?

27
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:34,442
Don't start this right now, please.

28
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:39,197
Can we just try to have fun?

29
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,950
We're out, okay? Let's just try.

30
00:04:43,368 --> 00:04:46,412
It's kind of cool to be out after dark,
you know?

31
00:04:46,496 --> 00:04:50,875
Childless people do this all the time.
Gets dark and they go out.

32
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:56,172
All the neon lights.
It's like a fucking video game.

33
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:58,424
It's like-- like <i>Tron.</i>

34
00:05:01,094 --> 00:05:02,571
Hey. We're so glad you could make it.

35
00:05:02,595 --> 00:05:04,222
Thanks for having us.

36
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:05,807
- Wow.
- This place is beautiful.

37
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,267
Matteo and Adrienne just bought the house
down the street.

38
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:09,852
- But they--
- Thank you. Yeah.

39
00:05:09,936 --> 00:05:12,772
But they can't move in
until, what, next October?

40
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:15,900
Yeah, there's this co-op
living community renting it.

41
00:05:15,984 --> 00:05:20,154
- It's, like, eight kids in their 20s.
- It's, like, ten kids, actually.

42
00:05:20,238 --> 00:05:22,216
Mm. I'm sure someone's sleeping
in the laundry room.

43
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,283
- Ew!
- It's kind of fun. Come on.

44
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:26,494
Shared space, you know. Cooking, cleaning.

45
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:29,205
- Life on the porch with a ukulele.
- Excuse me.

46
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:30,928
We showed up
for inspection with our baby.

47
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:34,419
She was, what? Like, seven days old.

48
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:37,213
- Yeah. So little--
- We scared them shitless.

49
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:39,173
Married people with babies. Run!

50
00:05:39,257 --> 00:05:41,134
We're not married. No.

51
00:05:41,217 --> 00:05:43,845
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to assume.

52
00:05:43,928 --> 00:05:46,681
No, we just-- We've got the house
and the baby, and so...

53
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:50,059
Also, like, I mean, marriage,
whatever, it's like...

54
00:05:50,143 --> 00:05:51,894
Totally. We wouldn't have
done it, honestly,

55
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:53,479
except my family would've killed me.

56
00:05:53,563 --> 00:05:56,107
No, you mean me. They would've
cut my dick off with a machete.

57
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:59,569
And I thought Adrienne's mom hated me.

58
00:05:59,652 --> 00:06:00,820
I mean, she does,

59
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:05,074
but more in a "I'm praying to God to curse
your eternal soul" kind of way.

60
00:06:05,158 --> 00:06:07,702
When she comes to the house,
we play this game

61
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:09,996
where we pretend we can't see
or hear each other.

62
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,497
Very pleasant.

63
00:06:11,581 --> 00:06:13,499
Okay, excuse me.

64
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:17,962
- Liam? Hey!
- Hey!

65
00:06:18,046 --> 00:06:19,922
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

66
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:22,216
I'm good.
I haven't seen you here in so long.

67
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,190
I guess now I know
why you wanted to come so badly.

68
00:06:37,273 --> 00:06:40,693
I had no idea that he was
going to be there, okay?

69
00:06:40,777 --> 00:06:44,655
And God forbid I have friends.
You certainly have friends, right?

70
00:06:54,874 --> 00:06:57,085
You know,
we both deserve to be happy.

71
00:06:57,168 --> 00:06:58,795
Liam makes you happy?

72
00:06:58,878 --> 00:07:00,588
I didn't say that. Are you happy?

73
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:02,256
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

74
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,383
Oh, that's convincing.

75
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:06,803
We agreed not to do anything crazy
in the first year.

76
00:07:06,886 --> 00:07:08,679
We just have to get through
the first year.

77
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:10,949
I don't want to just get through it.
I want to enjoy it.

78
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:12,975
- You want to control it.
- What choice do I have?

79
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:15,061
I'm dragging you
through the motions of our life.

80
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:18,397
Your life. You wanted to have a baby,
we had a baby.

81
00:07:18,481 --> 00:07:20,691
You wanted a house,
we bought the house. What now?

82
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:23,277
How about the truth?

83
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:28,241
- Don't.
- You can't do it.

84
00:07:28,324 --> 00:07:31,077
No, you want me to make up
some pretend confession

85
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,454
to justify your paranoia,
and I won't do that.

86
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:35,706
Yeah, right.

87
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,792
You're not gonna
be happy till you're miserable.

88
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:41,254
You know, I just-- I actually-- Honestly,
I do not know what the point is.

89
00:07:41,337 --> 00:07:42,839
Of life?

90
00:07:42,922 --> 00:07:46,175
Of us. Why are we
even together anymore?

91
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:52,739
We--

92
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:56,811
We have a newborn baby.
We just closed escrow. What?

93
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:00,273
Now what? You want to split up?

94
00:08:00,356 --> 00:08:01,899
I want to--

95
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,436
<i>All these neon lights...</i>

96
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:42,023
<i>It's like a video game.</i>

97
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:46,694
<i>Can you hear me? Can you hear me?</i>

98
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:51,741
<i>You know,
we both deserve to be happy.</i>

99
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,496
<i>Are you happy?</i>

100
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:19,435
<i>Time of death: 12:34 a.m.</i>

101
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:43,167
Chica! Please don't!

102
00:09:43,251 --> 00:09:45,294
Chica!

103
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:56,722
- We'll give you a minute.
- No!

104
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,147
Wait.

105
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:44,854
<i>Is there something
beyond all this? Is there an afterlife?</i>

106
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:47,606
<i>Today on our show, we'll seek answers
to those questions.</i>

107
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:51,193
<i>Our first guest was rushed to the
hospital...</i>

108
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:03,012
Ellie.

109
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,640
Ellie.

110
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,005
Look at Mommy, baby.

111
00:11:15,468 --> 00:11:17,887
Ellie. Ellie.

112
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:20,723
Ellie, look at Mama.

113
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:25,144
<i>I remember
one minute being in this world</i>

114
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:27,980
<i>and the next minute being, like, I died.</i>

115
00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:56,634
- I miss her so much.
- Maggie?

116
00:11:56,717 --> 00:12:00,012
- I can't believe she's gone.
- I know.

117
00:12:00,096 --> 00:12:02,681
- That's in my face.
- Sorry. I'm quitting.

118
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:04,558
I just can't lose you.

119
00:12:04,642 --> 00:12:06,018
Come here.

120
00:12:15,111 --> 00:12:17,321
<i>Thank you all for being here.</i>

121
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:24,286
Okay.

122
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:28,833
"To everything there is a season...

123
00:12:30,668 --> 00:12:34,171
and a time to every purpose
under the heavens...

124
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:38,217
a time to be born...

125
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:43,973
and a time to die."

126
00:12:46,434 --> 00:12:48,144
I'm sorry.

127
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:51,313
This feels so unreal.

128
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,860
Like a mistake, you know?

129
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:04,201
Like I could reach into the hourglass
and stir the sands and just change it all.

130
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:09,707
No, I'm sorry. I...

131
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,251
I can't do this. Sorry.

132
00:13:13,252 --> 00:13:14,378
Sorry.

133
00:13:20,426 --> 00:13:23,554
Poor thing.
I'm gonna go check on him.

134
00:13:24,722 --> 00:13:26,098
"Love is patient, love is kind."

135
00:13:26,182 --> 00:13:27,433
Shea!

136
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:29,396
- "It does not envy, it does not boast."
- Shea!

137
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:33,939
Let's let the body cool off first, okay?

138
00:13:34,023 --> 00:13:35,691
It's better this way.

139
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:41,197
My sweet girl. See? All the toys.

140
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,033
Yeah! So many pretty toys.

141
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:53,042
See, this is Ellie's room now,
and we're gonna do just great. Mm.

142
00:13:57,338 --> 00:14:01,425
Ellie Bellie, you're gonna live
with Grandma and Grandpa now.

143
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:18,400
Look at you.

144
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,364
- Grandma?
- Hmm?

145
00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:27,368
Do you really think she loved my dad?

146
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:31,038
Are those my journals? Oh, God, no. Fuck.
Don't-- Please don't look at those.

147
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:35,417
I think your dad was hard to love.

148
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:38,170
Stop now.

149
00:14:38,254 --> 00:14:41,632
It's not your fault your father left.

150
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:46,262
Tears won't solve anything.
They won't bring him back.

151
00:14:47,263 --> 00:14:49,974
Bring him back from where?

152
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:53,018
Where is your dad?
Where the shit is your dad?

153
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,772
Matteo?

154
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:51,493
Hey! Adrienne!

155
00:15:51,577 --> 00:15:53,996
Come down. What are you doing?

156
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:56,874
You can see me.

157
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:58,584
What?

158
00:16:00,044 --> 00:16:02,046
I died.

159
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:05,090
- I died, Matteo.
- Okay.

160
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:09,094
It's so wrong that that was it.
It was just headlights and a half gasp--

161
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:10,278
Stop. Stop.

162
00:16:11,347 --> 00:16:14,767
You're confused. We had an accident.

163
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:17,561
Oh, my God, you're dead too.

164
00:16:17,645 --> 00:16:18,937
What? No!

165
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:20,689
No, I'm not.

166
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,567
And you're not.

167
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:24,985
How do you know?

168
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:28,238
Because I know.

169
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:31,033
Well, because we're here.

170
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:36,288
I mean, spending eternity
on the 10 Freeway--

171
00:16:36,372 --> 00:16:37,873
What did we do to deserve that?

172
00:16:41,377 --> 00:16:43,671
You weren't there with Ellie.

173
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:45,631
Where do you go?

174
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:49,802
What happens to you? You just get scared
and then, what, you just-- you disappear?

175
00:16:50,803 --> 00:16:52,596
You concussed. That's it.

176
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:55,933
No. I'm dead.

177
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:57,976
I could step into traffic now.
It wouldn't matter.

178
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:03,857
It's okay.

179
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:07,778
What is this, like, Purgatory?
What's happening to me?

180
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,488
Just hold on to me. Hmm?

181
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:27,881
We just want
what's best for Ellie.

182
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:30,259
We can't leave her here, Steve.

183
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:33,470
If she had just left instructions

184
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:36,348
for what she would've wanted
in a situation like this...

185
00:17:36,432 --> 00:17:38,559
She would want us
to take care of Ellie.

186
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:39,742
What about Matteo?

187
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:43,814
God forgive me, but this is all his fault.

188
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:46,316
He couldn't take care of her.
He wouldn't marry her.

189
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,235
He couldn't protect her, and now she's--

190
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:50,404
I don't think we should get ahead
of ourselves.

191
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:52,448
We should take the baby home.

192
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:31,779
Shit!

193
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,990
What? What happened?

194
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:40,788
There was somebody outside.
I thought I saw some--

195
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:44,792
Outside? It was me. I was outside.

196
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,503
The door was locked.
I had to go around the house.

197
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:56,553
I don't know how much time
I have left here, Matteo.

198
00:18:57,554 --> 00:18:59,223
Well, none of us do, right?

199
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:00,766
It's part of the mystery.

200
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:03,018
I heard them talking.
They're gonna take Ellie.

201
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:04,102
- Who said--
- My mother.

202
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:06,188
I just heard them.

203
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,276
I'm perfectly capable
of taking care of my family, Patty.

204
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,654
Thank you very much.

205
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:15,030
As if it was my fault.

206
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:19,076
Hey. We got to get you better, okay?

207
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:22,871
But no one is taking our baby. Okay?

208
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:26,708
Hey. Come.

209
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:28,919
Come, come.

210
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:34,091
It will take a pack of wolves more rabid
than your mother to take her away.

211
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:35,274
All right?

212
00:19:38,554 --> 00:19:40,389
Do we even have a baby?

213
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:43,141
- What?
- The baby was in the car,

214
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:45,686
- but the car seat was emp--
- Hey. You--

215
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:47,896
Maybe I just imagined that we have a baby.

216
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,400
You-- You didn't want to have a baby.

217
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:56,613
We have a baby. Ellie is our baby.

218
00:19:56,697 --> 00:20:00,200
She's six months old, kinda cute.

219
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:05,455
Remember when she was born,
that she couldn't latch?

220
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:06,957
We were freaking out.

221
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,795
And then these researchers
from Denmark came.

222
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:13,547
Remember what he said?

223
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:18,552
"We're doing a study on the benefits
of..." Of what?

224
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:22,222
Of narrative therapy
for new mothers and newborns.

225
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:24,725
You've been through
a traumatic experience,

226
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:27,477
but you've been able to process
by talking through it.

227
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:30,022
The birth was traumatic for you,

228
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:32,250
but you've been able to talk about it
with your husband.

229
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:33,374
Boyfriend.

230
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:36,695
- Sorry? Right.
- Nothing. Nothing.

231
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:39,990
But the baby, she has no idea
what has happened.

232
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:42,910
She needs to process too.

233
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:47,748
You need to tell her her story.

234
00:20:53,128 --> 00:20:54,379
Um, okay.

235
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:03,180
We had kind of a crazy birth, huh?

236
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:06,808
It was hard, and it was painful...

237
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:10,687
because the cord was wrapped around you

238
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:13,941
and you couldn't breathe.

239
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:21,323
And then all these people rushed in,
and it was bright, and it was loud,

240
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:24,201
but those people were helping you.

241
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:25,869
You weren't alone.

242
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:29,373
And we were there the whole time.

243
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:32,626
We were just not breathing
with you for those 90 seconds...

244
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:35,253
and then you did.

245
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:39,049
You breathed.

246
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:42,344
And I know you're so tired
from all that craziness,

247
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:44,429
but you're all better now.

248
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:47,766
You're safe.

249
00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:55,190
But, my baby, you've got to eat.

250
00:22:07,703 --> 00:22:09,579
She's on.

251
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:31,393
You see?

252
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:34,980
Remember, we have a baby.

253
00:22:39,735 --> 00:22:42,821
I'm gonna help you make sense
of everything else.

254
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:46,116
I'm gonna-- I'm gonna tell you
our story, okay?

255
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:51,246
That way you can know that you're okay.

256
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:54,041
You can know you're safe.

257
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:57,419
What if you're wrong?

258
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:00,922
What if it's a sad story?

259
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,760
No.

260
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:08,138
- It's not.
- Sorry to wake you.

261
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:10,390
One second, Patty.

262
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:11,892
You need anything?

263
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:13,393
Tell her you're fine, please.

264
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:15,729
I'm not even here.

265
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:17,856
So she's talking to a dead girl?

266
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:19,039
To you.

267
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:20,275
Okay.

268
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:24,488
Okay, so you won't talk
to anyone for a bit. Okay?

269
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:28,283
We'll stay here, and we'll figure
this out ourselves.

270
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:30,160
I did some laundry,

271
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:33,246
and I was thinking
I'd make soup tonight.

272
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:36,958
I have to go to the store,
so if you want anything...

273
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:40,087
Thank you, Patty.
We're fine. Thank you. Take your time.

274
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:43,465
Okay, let's stay in bed.

275
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:46,802
One step at a time. Hey.

276
00:23:48,804 --> 00:23:51,556
- Shall we start from the beginning?
- Of time?

277
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:53,657
Of us.

278
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,686
Fine.

279
00:23:58,188 --> 00:24:00,440
If it means you'll stay, then fine.

280
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:05,237
I will stay. Close your eyes.

281
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:11,576
- Where are we? What is it?
- Okay, this way.

282
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,638
- Okay, all right, stop. Stop. Stop.
- I don't like it.

283
00:24:13,662 --> 00:24:16,665
- I don't want it.
- Okay, one, two, three.

284
00:24:16,748 --> 00:24:18,083
Surprise!

285
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:20,752
Yeah!

286
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:27,050
Oh, my God, you guys, this is awesome.

287
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,972
What is this?

288
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:40,939
I was so uncomfortable in the spotlight.

289
00:24:41,022 --> 00:24:43,525
- Hi!
- And I thought that was so cute.

290
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:45,944
All these people are here
because they love you so much.

291
00:24:46,027 --> 00:24:47,612
Look, and there's so many snacks.

292
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:15,515
I remember you blushed.

293
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:17,225
No, I didn't.

294
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:19,686
- Okay.
- What? I didn't.

295
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:22,647
I lured you in with my boyish charm.
That's what I did.

296
00:25:25,317 --> 00:25:29,112
Oh, yeah, this one. Shia. Sean?

297
00:25:29,196 --> 00:25:30,989
Come on. You remember her name.

298
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,408
Shea.

299
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:36,912
She was always just so much.

300
00:25:39,414 --> 00:25:42,626
She never really talked to me
after we got together.

301
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:43,960
She talked to you.

302
00:25:45,253 --> 00:25:47,422
I told you nothing happened with Shea.

303
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:50,550
Yeah, you did tell me that.

304
00:26:03,939 --> 00:26:06,524
Shea got me a job
in a hotel in Palm Springs.

305
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:10,070
All the woodwork and doors.

306
00:26:10,153 --> 00:26:12,322
- With her?
- Just two months.

307
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:26,294
I haven't finished with the night we met.

308
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:30,966
You remember what we talked about?

309
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:35,595
- Hmm. Movies?
<i>- Aliens.</i>

310
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:37,806
- My love of show tunes.
- Yes,

311
00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:40,058
and yet, I kept talking to you.

312
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:44,271
And, oh, <i>The Bluest Eye.</i>
You love Toni Morrison.

313
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:46,439
And I wanted to give you
a blowjob right there.

314
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:48,066
What? No.

315
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:49,442
- No way.
- Way.

316
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:52,862
Fuck, I wish I knew.

317
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:58,868
You were focused on me so intently,
like we were the only ones there.

318
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:04,833
- And you told me about your stepdad.
- Not that night.

319
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:07,168
No, you did. About the last time
that you saw him.

320
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:10,422
Oh, yeah. I was ten.

321
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:14,426
He had his hands around my mom's neck,

322
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:18,013
so I called the cops,
and of course he denied it.

323
00:27:19,139 --> 00:27:21,391
Then my mom blamed me when he left.

324
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:23,977
I'm sorry.

325
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,980
No, I'm sorry.
What a downer.

326
00:27:29,858 --> 00:27:34,362
My parents are a pain, but not painful
enough that I can get rid of them.

327
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:36,531
That's too bad.

328
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:38,283
- I mean...
- No, I mean, that's good.

329
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:40,410
It's good, I guess.

330
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:41,593
- Anyway...
- Cheers.

331
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:55,133
You can spend the night in my room
if you promise to, um, not molest me.

332
00:27:59,471 --> 00:28:02,891
- No, wait. That was weeks later.
- I remember.

333
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:06,019
You asked to crash on my couch.

334
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:13,443
- What time's your meeting in the morning?
- It's at 9:00.

335
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:16,613
Thank you for letting me stay.

336
00:28:16,696 --> 00:28:20,200
It's just that traffic in the morning,
it's crazy heading this way, so...

337
00:28:20,283 --> 00:28:23,828
- I thought it would be easier.
- Yeah, no worries. It's fine.

338
00:28:27,248 --> 00:28:29,250
You know, I lied about the meeting.

339
00:28:30,502 --> 00:28:31,920
There was no meeting.

340
00:28:33,588 --> 00:28:35,048
I know.

341
00:28:46,017 --> 00:28:48,436
It was almost dawn.

342
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,313
I thought you were never gonna kiss me.

343
00:28:56,152 --> 00:28:59,739
- Oh!
- I tri-- I'm sorry.

344
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:03,243
I'm sorry. Come back.
Come back. Come back. Please.

345
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:09,958
Mm. I'm sorry.

346
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:27,559
Make love to me.

347
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:33,648
You got a condom?

348
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:36,943
- Don't you?
- No.

349
00:29:38,111 --> 00:29:39,821
- What? You light--
- Are you serious?

350
00:29:39,904 --> 00:29:42,407
I mean, you light a hundred candles,
and you have no condom?

351
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:44,409
I thought you'd have one. I'm sorry.

352
00:29:44,492 --> 00:29:48,288
No. What kind of feminist are you?

353
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:50,123
Wait.

354
00:29:56,463 --> 00:29:59,632
Thank God we don't use
these fucking things anymore.

355
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:02,302
Yeah, because we don't have sex anymore.

356
00:30:03,303 --> 00:30:05,513
No, I'm sorry. Shh, shh.

357
00:30:05,597 --> 00:30:09,434
Let's-- Let's not think about that. Focus.

358
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:25,783
Do you smell smoke?

359
00:30:29,162 --> 00:30:30,455
Fire!

360
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:33,416
Fuck!

361
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,503
Matteo! Matteo!

362
00:30:40,381 --> 00:30:41,633
You just left me there.

363
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:47,222
You just left me there to die.

364
00:30:47,305 --> 00:30:48,806
That's not what happened.

365
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:56,856
I came back. I came back and put it out.

366
00:30:58,024 --> 00:31:01,194
I saved the day.
I was fucking Superman that night.

367
00:31:02,195 --> 00:31:04,697
- We laughed about this.
- Yeah.

368
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,413
I love you.

369
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:15,708
No, I was the one that said it first.

370
00:31:17,335 --> 00:31:19,754
- Does it matter?
- Yes.

371
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,050
No. I don't know.

372
00:32:47,342 --> 00:32:48,718
There you are.

373
00:32:50,678 --> 00:32:52,639
Hey. You scared me.

374
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,308
I'm a good ghost.

375
00:32:57,727 --> 00:33:00,104
You promised you'd stay with me.

376
00:33:00,188 --> 00:33:02,231
I've been doing some research.

377
00:33:02,315 --> 00:33:06,152
It's kind of crazy what happens
to people after trauma.

378
00:33:06,235 --> 00:33:08,696
I mean, what they experience,
you know?

379
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,448
Makes sense that you feel off.

380
00:33:10,531 --> 00:33:13,159
- Off?
- Yeah.

381
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:15,995
What do you think happens when you die?

382
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:19,248
- Nothing.
- What if it's bad?

383
00:33:19,332 --> 00:33:24,545
Painful, some extension or manifestation
of your fears and your failings?

384
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:27,983
Of your last moments, again
and again and again and again?

385
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:29,842
No. No, no. Uh, wait.

386
00:33:31,386 --> 00:33:34,180
It can't just be
an insular emotional repetition.

387
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:39,060
I mean, if it's not nothing, it's gotta be
something bigger than that, right?

388
00:33:41,688 --> 00:33:44,524
We're space dust. Right?

389
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:47,068
So we just go back to that,
to be part of everything.

390
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:50,655
- The water, the trees.
- "Ashes to ashes, dust to dust."

391
00:33:50,738 --> 00:33:54,075
If you want to get Catholic
about it, yeah.

392
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:56,536
When you die, Adrienne...

393
00:33:57,704 --> 00:33:58,996
but you're not dead yet.

394
00:34:00,915 --> 00:34:03,710
I think I'm here to get you to step up
and take care of Ellie.

395
00:34:03,793 --> 00:34:05,813
- We talked about this.
- I saw it, and you weren't there.

396
00:34:05,837 --> 00:34:08,005
- Hey, stop it.
- I saw her, and you weren't there.

397
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:10,758
So maybe you are lying,
and that's why I'm stuck here.

398
00:34:10,842 --> 00:34:13,720
- I wouldn't lie about that. Wait.
- And that's why I'm still here.

399
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:14,971
No.

400
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:20,560
I know you're always the fixer,
always in control, but...

401
00:34:22,228 --> 00:34:24,230
you gotta trust me on this one. Hmm?

402
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:28,443
When I go, you'll be a good dad.

403
00:34:28,526 --> 00:34:30,337
- You're gonna learn to braid hair...
- Hey, stop.

404
00:34:30,361 --> 00:34:31,505
- ...and sing lullabies.
- Okay.

405
00:34:31,529 --> 00:34:33,364
- She's gonna need you.
- Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

406
00:34:35,825 --> 00:34:37,744
Let's talk about what's real.

407
00:34:38,828 --> 00:34:40,246
What really happened.

408
00:34:42,415 --> 00:34:43,708
Okay?

409
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:49,422
Mexico. A happy memory.

410
00:34:53,634 --> 00:34:55,136
- It's okay.
- Don't.

411
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:56,637
It's okay.

412
00:35:12,904 --> 00:35:15,656
- I just met your family.
- Uh-huh.

413
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:18,743
They loved you.

414
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:21,162
I'm so glad you made us do this trip.

415
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:25,166
Afterwards.
You were always glad afterwards.

416
00:35:25,249 --> 00:35:28,628
Well, how could I ever imagine
it was going to be so...

417
00:35:28,711 --> 00:35:30,880
- Magical.
- It was.

418
00:35:32,507 --> 00:35:35,551
I could see our whole life, just this...

419
00:35:35,635 --> 00:35:39,138
beautiful adventure
carved out on the horizon.

420
00:35:41,015 --> 00:35:44,310
You made me rethink everything
I thought I knew about what I wanted.

421
00:35:59,784 --> 00:36:02,620
- Will they come?
- Yeah, they're coming.

422
00:36:10,962 --> 00:36:12,062
Here!

423
00:36:23,766 --> 00:36:25,142
Right here! Right here!
Right here!

424
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,522
There!

425
00:36:48,332 --> 00:36:49,667
<i>Gracias.</i>

426
00:36:56,382 --> 00:36:57,758
And then we died.

427
00:36:59,176 --> 00:37:01,762
<i>Hostel: Mexico,</i> straight to DVD.

428
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:13,566
I have told this story so many times,
it's almost like it's a fantasy.

429
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:17,445
This was real. This is real.

430
00:37:26,621 --> 00:37:28,748
I could stay
in this place forever.

431
00:37:29,749 --> 00:37:31,792
I so wanted you to propose.

432
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:34,211
I was going to.

433
00:37:35,212 --> 00:37:37,506
- What?
- Yeah.

434
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,675
I even looked at rings
and everything, but...

435
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:42,803
I thought you'd be mad.
I didn't have a ring.

436
00:37:42,887 --> 00:37:45,181
No, I wouldn't have.
I wouldn't have been mad.

437
00:37:45,264 --> 00:37:47,391
Yes, you would.

438
00:37:50,561 --> 00:37:53,272
Okay, I didn't propose,
but you remember what I said?

439
00:37:54,941 --> 00:37:59,153
I want to kiss you at the end of every day
for the rest of my life.

440
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:02,782
One for yesterday...

441
00:38:05,076 --> 00:38:06,494
one for today...

442
00:38:07,995 --> 00:38:09,747
one for tomorrow.

443
00:38:19,465 --> 00:38:22,176
It's so sad that we fell apart, isn't it?

444
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,846
Yeah.

445
00:38:34,105 --> 00:38:36,023
- What's wrong?
- What's happening?

446
00:38:36,107 --> 00:38:38,317
- What's happening?
- Hey.

447
00:38:38,401 --> 00:38:40,277
Hey. What's wrong?

448
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:41,612
What's happening?

449
00:38:41,696 --> 00:38:45,074
Adrienne. Adrienne, take a breath.

450
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:47,576
Adrienne, take a breath.

451
00:38:52,415 --> 00:38:55,376
Okay. Breathe. Breathe.

452
00:38:55,459 --> 00:38:57,503
Breathe. Breathe.

453
00:38:58,504 --> 00:39:01,048
Breathe. Adrienne, breathe.

454
00:39:01,132 --> 00:39:02,508
Okay. You're okay.

455
00:39:03,509 --> 00:39:04,677
You're okay.

456
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,138
You keep saying that, but clearly--

457
00:39:07,221 --> 00:39:08,973
What's wrong?

458
00:39:10,141 --> 00:39:12,852
- The water-- You didn't see the water.
- What?

459
00:39:15,813 --> 00:39:20,192
Just breathe, please.
Breathe. You're okay.

460
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,737
Look me in the eyes.

461
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:26,282
There you go. That works.

462
00:39:32,955 --> 00:39:35,291
Okay. Okay.

463
00:39:37,126 --> 00:39:40,546
Let me get you a towel. You'll be fine.

464
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:43,132
Okay? Don't move.

465
00:39:54,435 --> 00:39:56,062
<i>It's over now.</i>

466
00:39:57,897 --> 00:39:59,523
<i>Where's the baby?</i>

467
00:40:01,942 --> 00:40:04,278
No. No, you can't have her.

468
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:08,339
Ellie?

469
00:40:10,493 --> 00:40:11,593
Ellie!

470
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:14,955
Please! Somebody help me!

471
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:16,457
Help me!

472
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,876
Somebody help me!

473
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:20,544
Adrienne!

474
00:40:20,628 --> 00:40:24,131
- She's not breathing!
- What is it? Stop it. Stop it.

475
00:40:24,215 --> 00:40:26,092
Let Mama have the baby.

476
00:40:26,175 --> 00:40:28,886
- You're gonna hurt her. Steve!
- What happened?

477
00:40:28,969 --> 00:40:30,346
Let go. Let the baby go.

478
00:40:30,429 --> 00:40:33,724
- Oh...
- He can't have her! He can't have her!

479
00:40:33,808 --> 00:40:36,352
- Is she okay?
- She's fine.

480
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:40,439
- She's okay. She's okay.
- It's okay.

481
00:40:40,523 --> 00:40:42,066
Adrienne, what's going on?

482
00:40:42,149 --> 00:40:44,026
He's coming-- He's coming for her.

483
00:40:46,904 --> 00:40:50,032
- He's coming for her.
- What? What's coming?

484
00:40:50,116 --> 00:40:52,201
- What are you talking about?
- Dea--

485
00:40:53,452 --> 00:40:54,552
Death.

486
00:41:04,547 --> 00:41:05,548
Your mom tells me

487
00:41:05,631 --> 00:41:08,717
you've been experiencing some confusion
since the accident.

488
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:11,554
Are you in any pain?

489
00:41:18,018 --> 00:41:19,937
- Does that hurt?
- I don't know.

490
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:33,951
Adrienne, can you hear me?

491
00:41:35,786 --> 00:41:37,079
Do you know what day it is?

492
00:41:38,914 --> 00:41:41,167
Sorry, I'm not really here.

493
00:41:42,293 --> 00:41:43,711
Which one is it?

494
00:41:47,131 --> 00:41:48,799
She just needs her medicine.

495
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:56,265
Take two pills, three times a day...

496
00:42:07,151 --> 00:42:09,195
She's gonna be okay. She's a strong girl.

497
00:42:09,278 --> 00:42:10,878
Thanks for coming by.
I do appreciate it.

498
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:21,123
Ellie wanted to say hi.
Why don't you give her a hug?

499
00:42:22,917 --> 00:42:24,501
Okay, here, I'll take her.

500
00:42:24,585 --> 00:42:28,005
They've got her on so many pills,
I can't even keep them straight.

501
00:42:28,088 --> 00:42:31,425
I'm just gonna sit here with you,
okay? Just so you know.

502
00:42:33,052 --> 00:42:34,220
We don't even have to talk.

503
00:42:34,303 --> 00:42:35,930
She has physical therapy,

504
00:42:36,013 --> 00:42:39,099
and an appointment with a psychiatrist
on Tuesday.

505
00:42:39,183 --> 00:42:42,895
Okay, well, you know I'm here
if she needs anything. She'll be fine.

506
00:42:42,978 --> 00:42:47,274
I'm gonna take Ellie to our place
for a while, and Steve will stay with her.

507
00:43:00,788 --> 00:43:06,460
Children need stability, and this just is
not a good environment for her.

508
00:43:07,586 --> 00:43:09,255
So, the good news is,

509
00:43:09,338 --> 00:43:12,758
the other driver was at fault,
per the police report.

510
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:19,765
- Is he okay?
- He isn't claiming any injuries.

511
00:43:19,848 --> 00:43:22,142
Will you be taking Matteo's statement
separately

512
00:43:22,226 --> 00:43:26,272
to make sure we're telling the truth?
Because it was not his fault.

513
00:43:26,355 --> 00:43:29,525
No matter what
my mother may have told you.

514
00:43:31,235 --> 00:43:34,822
There was a witness who said he saw
the other driver gun through the yellow.

515
00:43:34,905 --> 00:43:36,532
Do you remember that?

516
00:43:41,161 --> 00:43:42,413
Adrienne?

517
00:43:56,302 --> 00:43:57,402
Zombies?

518
00:43:58,304 --> 00:43:59,847
You hate zombies.

519
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:02,182
They're my people now.

520
00:44:02,266 --> 00:44:04,518
I feel really connected to them, actually.

521
00:44:06,061 --> 00:44:07,521
They're very misunderstood.

522
00:44:11,317 --> 00:44:12,985
I--

523
00:44:15,279 --> 00:44:18,157
I know there's something wrong with me.

524
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,533
Yeah.

525
00:44:21,243 --> 00:44:22,911
But you're gonna get better.

526
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:25,706
If I was actually a zombie,

527
00:44:25,789 --> 00:44:28,167
would you tie me up
and keep me in your garage?

528
00:44:30,961 --> 00:44:33,881
Yeah, I guess so.

529
00:44:33,964 --> 00:44:36,925
I've been always
afraid of losing you, so yeah.

530
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:40,637
Because you knew you would?

531
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:46,185
Adrienne...

532
00:44:47,936 --> 00:44:49,730
doesn't it make sense, right...

533
00:44:51,273 --> 00:44:52,816
that you're alive?

534
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:56,695
That people can see you?
They talk to you.

535
00:44:57,821 --> 00:44:59,490
You <i>are</i> here.

536
00:44:59,573 --> 00:45:01,200
But I feel soulless.

537
00:45:03,702 --> 00:45:05,120
Hollowed out.

538
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:13,921
Do you remember when we realized
we were having a baby?

539
00:45:14,004 --> 00:45:15,964
Please don't.

540
00:45:16,048 --> 00:45:20,135
You keep trying to prove that I'm okay,
but I can prove I'm not.

541
00:45:21,303 --> 00:45:23,013
Can I tell you something?

542
00:45:25,974 --> 00:45:28,519
- Yeah.
- I knew I was gonna die.

543
00:45:30,896 --> 00:45:32,314
What do you mean?

544
00:45:33,899 --> 00:45:38,445
She told me, when we went to the house
to look at the broken window.

545
00:45:45,327 --> 00:45:47,037
I'm gonna check the window.

546
00:45:47,121 --> 00:45:48,622
- Hi.
- Hey, welcome.

547
00:45:48,705 --> 00:45:50,749
- Hey! How are you?
- Hey!

548
00:45:52,251 --> 00:45:54,837
- What are you guys doing?
- A reading.

549
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,840
- Oh, yeah?
- I'm an assistant to Psychic Elaine.

550
00:45:59,383 --> 00:46:01,760
She's, like, the best in L.A.,
like, the real, real deal.

551
00:46:01,844 --> 00:46:04,430
Like, not a storefront,
like, otherworldly,

552
00:46:04,513 --> 00:46:07,057
- and I'm studying under her.
- Wow.

553
00:46:07,141 --> 00:46:08,934
You want me to do a reading on you?

554
00:46:09,017 --> 00:46:12,729
- Sure, why not?
- I can get you later.

555
00:46:12,813 --> 00:46:16,066
Just don't tell me I feel old
because I think that much is obvious.

556
00:46:18,944 --> 00:46:21,822
Weird, your lifeline's really short.

557
00:46:21,905 --> 00:46:22,906
What?

558
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:25,367
I mean, it doesn't necessarily mean death.

559
00:46:25,451 --> 00:46:27,453
It could be like-- like you're not living,

560
00:46:27,536 --> 00:46:29,216
like you're not living life
to the fullest.

561
00:46:29,288 --> 00:46:32,166
Um... Or I could be doing it wrong.

562
00:46:32,249 --> 00:46:36,336
No. Yes, it's crazy. I'm-- It's true.

563
00:46:37,337 --> 00:46:38,547
I'm dead.

564
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:42,801
I die in a car accident,
two weeks after this.

565
00:46:42,885 --> 00:46:46,972
Whoa. That is crazy.

566
00:46:47,055 --> 00:46:49,933
We'll never get to move
into this house. It sucks.

567
00:46:50,017 --> 00:46:52,978
But if you knew, why did you let yourself
get into the car?

568
00:46:53,979 --> 00:46:55,079
Did you want to die?

569
00:46:57,232 --> 00:46:58,525
I don't know. I--

570
00:46:58,609 --> 00:47:01,361
This is grasping at straws, Adrienne.

571
00:47:01,445 --> 00:47:02,946
It's coincidence.

572
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:04,948
That's what you said to her, but then...

573
00:47:05,032 --> 00:47:07,159
How old were you when your mother died?

574
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,578
What...

575
00:47:09,661 --> 00:47:12,623
- Did-Did-Did you tell her?
- No, I swear I didn't.

576
00:47:12,706 --> 00:47:14,374
He was 17.

577
00:47:14,458 --> 00:47:16,293
She's lingering for you.

578
00:47:16,376 --> 00:47:18,670
There's something unresolved.

579
00:47:18,754 --> 00:47:21,590
She says she wishes
that you spoke at her funeral.

580
00:47:21,673 --> 00:47:24,051
That's it.

581
00:47:27,179 --> 00:47:30,265
Okay. That's our cue to go. Sorry.

582
00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:33,143
- You never told me. Was that true?
- Ye-- No.

583
00:47:33,227 --> 00:47:35,979
Well, yes. Yes. Yes, it was true.

584
00:47:36,063 --> 00:47:38,315
I was young. I didn't know what to say.

585
00:47:38,398 --> 00:47:42,528
I was mad at her, but that doesn't prove
that she's psychic or that you're dead.

586
00:47:42,611 --> 00:47:46,073
I kept asking myself again and again,
what is the point of life?

587
00:47:46,156 --> 00:47:49,243
Of us. You kept asking yourself
what's the point of us.

588
00:47:49,326 --> 00:47:53,872
But then when I left Gary and Kevin's
that night, I had a really bad feeling.

589
00:47:53,956 --> 00:47:55,165
Adrienne...

590
00:47:58,794 --> 00:48:01,463
I had this feeling like everything
was falling apart.

591
00:48:05,676 --> 00:48:06,776
Adrienne.

592
00:48:09,805 --> 00:48:11,682
You were pissed at me.

593
00:48:11,765 --> 00:48:14,035
If we hadn't bought the house,
none of this would've happened.

594
00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:15,870
- What? It could've been a plane crash.
- It's my fault.

595
00:48:15,894 --> 00:48:18,814
Stop trying to find meaning
in something meaningless and random.

596
00:48:18,897 --> 00:48:20,941
You didn't cause the accident.

597
00:48:21,024 --> 00:48:22,985
If there's someone to blame,
it's me. Yeah.

598
00:48:23,068 --> 00:48:24,069
I wanted to go out that night,

599
00:48:24,152 --> 00:48:26,214
- so we did.
- I didn't see the guy coming. No, no, no.

600
00:48:26,238 --> 00:48:30,033
I didn't see the guy coming.
I wanted to stay late.

601
00:48:30,117 --> 00:48:33,203
Hey, stop hijacking this.
Let me finish the story.

602
00:48:33,287 --> 00:48:36,623
I don't want you to finish your story.
I want you to tell the truth.

603
00:48:36,707 --> 00:48:38,292
- You want the truth?
- Yes!

604
00:48:38,375 --> 00:48:40,752
Fine. It wasn't all good.

605
00:48:40,836 --> 00:48:43,171
Do you remember that work event?

606
00:48:43,255 --> 00:48:47,092
You had just gotten your job
doing grunt work at the museum.

607
00:48:47,175 --> 00:48:49,011
Oh, my God. Grunt work?

608
00:48:49,094 --> 00:48:52,306
I'm managing major design installations.
This is not grunt work.

609
00:48:52,389 --> 00:48:54,224
I don't know why you took it.

610
00:48:54,308 --> 00:48:56,602
Well, aside from the fact
that it's my dream job,

611
00:48:56,685 --> 00:48:58,525
some people actually have
to work for a living,

612
00:48:58,562 --> 00:49:01,690
so that they can support their family,
so they can buy a house.

613
00:49:01,773 --> 00:49:02,899
- Okay, yeah?
- Thank you.

614
00:49:02,983 --> 00:49:04,419
Have piles of shit, right? Thank you.

615
00:49:04,443 --> 00:49:06,695
You don't want things?
You don't want tools and tech toys

616
00:49:06,778 --> 00:49:09,299
and whatever other shit it is
you get shipped direct to your garage?

617
00:49:09,323 --> 00:49:11,533
Okay, I'm just saying
that if we stay in the apartment,

618
00:49:11,617 --> 00:49:16,622
we have a low rent, we keep some freedom,
and we're not tied to a mortgage.

619
00:49:16,705 --> 00:49:19,374
If you're never tied to anything,
then you'll never be free.

620
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:22,044
What musical is that from?

621
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:25,130
It's from <i>Pippin.</i> It doesn't--

622
00:49:25,213 --> 00:49:27,341
Doesn't mean that it's not true.

623
00:49:27,424 --> 00:49:29,551
What about this beautiful
adventure we're on?

624
00:49:29,635 --> 00:49:32,846
You're going to be working
from 9:00 to 9:00 every day.

625
00:49:32,929 --> 00:49:38,352
We're gonna be laden with kids,
the house, with no time to go anywhere.

626
00:49:38,435 --> 00:49:42,230
Not everyone can not finish school
and not get a real job...

627
00:49:42,314 --> 00:49:43,625
- I have a real job.
- ...and not care.

628
00:49:43,649 --> 00:49:46,234
- I have a real job.
- This is what I want.

629
00:49:46,318 --> 00:49:50,155
If you don't want it too, you should
just... get out of my way.

630
00:49:56,787 --> 00:49:57,887
See?

631
00:49:59,706 --> 00:50:01,249
Where do you go?

632
00:50:06,505 --> 00:50:09,716
- Adrienne.
- Hey! How are you?

633
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,385
I'm good. Champagne?

634
00:50:11,468 --> 00:50:13,178
Mind reader. Thank you.

635
00:50:14,805 --> 00:50:17,391
The look in your eyes. So alive.

636
00:50:17,474 --> 00:50:19,559
He is a work colleague,
and he's on the board.

637
00:50:19,643 --> 00:50:22,020
- I am supposed to be nice to him.
- Thank you.

638
00:50:22,104 --> 00:50:24,815
- For what?
- For making this event worth attending.

639
00:50:24,898 --> 00:50:29,820
I'm-- Yeah. Frida Kahlo and Maya Deren
in one space? Be still my heart.

640
00:50:29,903 --> 00:50:33,990
Yeah. I know I should be
focused on the art, but I just can't.

641
00:50:34,074 --> 00:50:36,243
- Why?
- You're distracting me.

642
00:50:36,326 --> 00:50:39,121
I just-- I threw on...

643
00:50:39,204 --> 00:50:41,707
like, frazzled, like, whatever work thing.

644
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:45,252
Don't underestimate yourself.

645
00:50:52,175 --> 00:50:56,471
Okay, fine. Fine.
You saw that. So what? So what?

646
00:50:57,973 --> 00:51:00,308
I'm sorry. Matteo is trying
to prove that I'm alive

647
00:51:00,392 --> 00:51:04,813
by making me feel,
what, like, guilty? Thanks.

648
00:51:04,896 --> 00:51:07,190
He invited me to check out
his woodworking.

649
00:51:08,233 --> 00:51:11,194
- The same night?
- Yeah, I think so.

650
00:51:11,278 --> 00:51:12,738
I bought a bench.

651
00:51:27,419 --> 00:51:30,172
- Here it comes.
- Such terror.

652
00:51:30,255 --> 00:51:31,923
You told me it was referred by a friend.

653
00:51:32,007 --> 00:51:33,592
How did you kill me that fast?

654
00:51:33,675 --> 00:51:35,635
I didn't even know
you guys knew each other.

655
00:51:35,719 --> 00:51:37,220
Hmm. So you lied.

656
00:51:37,304 --> 00:51:40,807
Now you know the truth. Feel better?

657
00:51:40,891 --> 00:51:42,642
I'm just saying, most guys

658
00:51:42,726 --> 00:51:45,270
would punch a guy
who was making moves on their girlfriend.

659
00:51:45,353 --> 00:51:48,774
Okay.
You wanted me to punch him?

660
00:51:48,857 --> 00:51:51,401
He's got six inches on me. No way.

661
00:51:51,485 --> 00:51:53,171
Why didn't you just tell me
you were jealous?

662
00:51:53,195 --> 00:51:55,530
I didn't think
I could do anything about it.

663
00:51:56,782 --> 00:51:59,785
I mean, probably delay it. Did I?

664
00:52:00,786 --> 00:52:02,746
I didn't cheat on you.

665
00:52:03,747 --> 00:52:05,832
- Did you want to?
- It doesn't matter.

666
00:52:05,916 --> 00:52:08,251
It matters. It fucking matters.

667
00:52:18,011 --> 00:52:19,971
Bullshit! Bullshit!
That-- That never happened.

668
00:52:20,055 --> 00:52:23,016
Okay. Look me in the eye
and tell me I am making this up.

669
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:25,060
You live so in your head.
You exaggerate things.

670
00:52:25,143 --> 00:52:26,704
- You conflate things.
- Stop lying to me.

671
00:52:26,728 --> 00:52:29,940
Stop ignoring-- Stop disappearing on me.

672
00:52:30,023 --> 00:52:31,316
On our baby.

673
00:52:31,399 --> 00:52:34,402
Even me dying isn't enough
to get you to step up.

674
00:52:36,696 --> 00:52:39,783
It's so unfair you expect me to fail.

675
00:52:39,866 --> 00:52:42,244
You can't pretend to know
what's going to happen,

676
00:52:42,327 --> 00:52:44,454
how I would feel if I lost you.

677
00:52:45,622 --> 00:52:47,624
What fucking living hell
that would be for me.

678
00:52:50,627 --> 00:52:53,421
Maybe I would never recover.

679
00:52:54,422 --> 00:52:55,841
Maybe I would be no good for Ellie.

680
00:52:57,676 --> 00:52:59,302
Maybe I would break if I lost you.

681
00:53:05,016 --> 00:53:06,977
Who is that?

682
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:08,160
I'm gonna check.

683
00:53:11,356 --> 00:53:13,316
Hi, Steve. How you holding up?

684
00:53:14,317 --> 00:53:18,113
- Hello, Father Richard.
- Proof that I'm dead.

685
00:53:18,196 --> 00:53:22,367
Your mother calls Father Richard
if the milk is past its due date.

686
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:25,704
Adrienne, they're planning a bingo night
at the church.

687
00:53:27,038 --> 00:53:28,206
What are you doing?

688
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:30,959
I'm trying... I'm trying to work out

689
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:32,752
- what to be buried in.
- What?

690
00:53:32,836 --> 00:53:34,629
This one actually
doesn't zip up at the back,

691
00:53:34,713 --> 00:53:37,382
but if you leave it unzipped,
I don't think anybody's gonna notice.

692
00:53:37,465 --> 00:53:38,717
- Slow down.
- Actually,

693
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,678
I think I would rather be
scattered somewhere beautiful.

694
00:53:41,761 --> 00:53:43,346
Oh, okay.

695
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:46,433
You have a second chance, Matteo,
and you've just got to move on.

696
00:53:47,434 --> 00:53:49,644
And you gotta find somebody that you love.

697
00:53:49,728 --> 00:53:51,271
Not Shea. Please don't marry Shea.

698
00:53:51,354 --> 00:53:54,024
Somebody--

699
00:53:54,107 --> 00:53:55,984
Somebody educated
and somebody funny.

700
00:53:57,402 --> 00:54:02,157
Find somebody funny and just love them.
And let them love you.

701
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,634
It's gonna be weird to bring a girl

702
00:54:03,658 --> 00:54:05,911
with my dead girlfriend
still in my bed, right?

703
00:54:05,994 --> 00:54:10,916
And I want my funeral to be fun.
Not in a church, please.

704
00:54:10,999 --> 00:54:12,476
- Okay.
- No matter what my mother says.

705
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:15,545
We'll have a dance-pop party funeral.

706
00:54:15,629 --> 00:54:17,023
You're the one who likes pop music.

707
00:54:17,047 --> 00:54:19,633
I don't like pop music.
I want Missy Elliott.

708
00:54:19,716 --> 00:54:23,845
Okay, we'll have a bunch
of geriatrics dancing to Missy Elliott.

709
00:54:23,929 --> 00:54:26,765
Man, life.

710
00:54:26,848 --> 00:54:29,768
- Perfect.
- What a tricky little minx.

711
00:54:32,938 --> 00:54:34,522
Hey, stop. Stop!

712
00:54:34,606 --> 00:54:36,107
Stop!

713
00:54:36,191 --> 00:54:38,818
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.

714
00:54:38,902 --> 00:54:40,403
What the fuck are you doing?

715
00:54:43,323 --> 00:54:45,492
You don't get to be dead yet, okay?

716
00:54:46,868 --> 00:54:49,537
Fuck. So impatient.

717
00:54:58,838 --> 00:54:59,965
Adrienne.

718
00:55:09,891 --> 00:55:12,936
Look at me. So impatient.

719
00:55:15,981 --> 00:55:19,109
Even having kids.
You remember it? Last year.

720
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:21,736
<i>El Día de Muertos?</i>

721
00:55:25,949 --> 00:55:27,993
Stay with me.

722
00:55:28,076 --> 00:55:29,744
I know you remember.

723
00:55:41,256 --> 00:55:42,549
- Yeah.
- Okay.

724
00:55:42,632 --> 00:55:45,093
- I'd be down.
- Can we get two of those, please?

725
00:55:45,176 --> 00:55:48,221
Okay, I gotta say this quick.
Uh, A wants a baby.

726
00:55:48,304 --> 00:55:50,348
- What?
- Here is a cute--

727
00:55:50,432 --> 00:55:53,184
She's gonna break up with you
if you don't pull the goalie right now.

728
00:55:53,268 --> 00:55:56,062
What the--
We just started talking about this.

729
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:58,773
He shouldn't have told you that.

730
00:55:58,857 --> 00:56:01,234
She said she was going to poke a hole
in her diaphragm.

731
00:56:01,317 --> 00:56:02,944
I was kidding.

732
00:56:03,028 --> 00:56:04,696
I was kidding, obviously.

733
00:56:04,779 --> 00:56:06,340
Okay, it didn't sound
like you were kidding.

734
00:56:06,364 --> 00:56:08,199
- Maggie.
- I'm just being honest.

735
00:56:08,283 --> 00:56:10,952
Okay, she was upset,
and I talked her down.

736
00:56:11,036 --> 00:56:12,328
So impatient.

737
00:56:12,412 --> 00:56:15,957
I'm just asking you to be patient
with me, with us.

738
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:20,462
- May I finish the story?
- Okay, sure.

739
00:56:20,545 --> 00:56:23,423
I remember what else happened that day.

740
00:56:23,506 --> 00:56:26,092
Fucking Matteo!

741
00:56:26,176 --> 00:56:29,220
Hi! You said you were out of town.

742
00:56:30,972 --> 00:56:33,433
No. No. Um...

743
00:56:33,516 --> 00:56:35,101
- The-The trip got canceled.
- Oh...

744
00:56:35,185 --> 00:56:38,146
It's so funny that Shea would know
about a trip of yours that got canceled,

745
00:56:38,229 --> 00:56:39,856
'cause you guys "don't talk."

746
00:56:39,939 --> 00:56:42,317
This is not why I brought this memory up.

747
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,568
- Hey!
- Shea.

748
00:56:43,651 --> 00:56:47,447
- Hi! Wow, you look so great.
- Hi. So do you, always.

749
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:49,115
- How are you guys?
- Great.

750
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:50,867
- Yeah? Are you married yet?
- Uh-huh.

751
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:52,327
Oh, God, no.

752
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:55,455
No, I cannot bear the idea
of letting this oaf own me,

753
00:56:55,538 --> 00:56:59,793
but it's so great that you guys
still talk, that you kept in touch.

754
00:56:59,876 --> 00:57:03,213
Even though you swore to me
that you didn't talk to her anymore. Liar.

755
00:57:03,296 --> 00:57:06,424
Of course. I'm sorry we haven't talked.
That's so--

756
00:57:06,508 --> 00:57:09,427
- That's stupid. It's so stupid.
- No, totally. Right, right.

757
00:57:09,511 --> 00:57:11,012
We should have lunch. Lie.

758
00:57:11,096 --> 00:57:12,305
- Totally.
- Lie.

759
00:57:13,431 --> 00:57:15,225
Hey, are you still, um, woodworking?

760
00:57:15,308 --> 00:57:16,893
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Oh.

761
00:57:16,976 --> 00:57:19,354
Amazing, because my dad
just bought this huge property.

762
00:57:19,437 --> 00:57:21,898
So I actually, um--
I might have a job for you.

763
00:57:21,981 --> 00:57:23,081
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

764
00:57:23,108 --> 00:57:24,818
- That's so sweet.
- Yeah.

765
00:57:24,901 --> 00:57:27,237
This was the beginning
of the end, wasn't it?

766
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,405
- What? No, no, no, no.
- Cool, so, um...

767
00:57:31,491 --> 00:57:33,660
It was so good to see you, girl.

768
00:57:35,453 --> 00:57:36,955
Hey. Bye.

769
00:57:37,956 --> 00:57:39,290
I love you.

770
00:57:39,374 --> 00:57:42,210
What?

771
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,381
Why don't you just be with Shea, Matteo?

772
00:57:46,464 --> 00:57:48,925
Are you crazy?
If I wanted to be with her, I would be.

773
00:57:49,008 --> 00:57:51,511
- Is that a threat?
- No, I'm just saying, I'm with you.

774
00:57:54,889 --> 00:57:56,975
God, I was so much, wasn't I?

775
00:57:57,976 --> 00:57:59,978
No. We made up, didn't we?

776
00:58:00,979 --> 00:58:02,438
- Did we?
- Yeah.

777
00:58:03,439 --> 00:58:04,941
Yeah, yeah, yeah. This--

778
00:58:05,024 --> 00:58:07,777
This wasn't the beginning of the end.

779
00:58:07,861 --> 00:58:09,863
This was the moment when we...

780
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:12,198
when I told you...

781
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:18,246
I wanna have babies with you, okay?

782
00:58:19,455 --> 00:58:20,555
I wanna have a kid.

783
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:23,585
Let's have a baby.

784
00:58:25,545 --> 00:58:28,673
You only agreed because I threatened
to leave you if you didn't.

785
00:58:28,756 --> 00:58:32,385
Okay, yeah, but I still agreed. Right?

786
00:58:34,304 --> 00:58:35,597
Because I wanted to.

787
00:58:36,598 --> 00:58:39,309
You're right. Let's do it.

788
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,938
No, what's wrong?

789
00:58:45,481 --> 00:58:47,108
I'm so glad you said yes.

790
00:58:48,359 --> 00:58:50,278
And I'm so glad we had Ellie.

791
00:59:07,712 --> 00:59:10,340
Hey, what's wrong? I said yes, right?

792
00:59:26,105 --> 00:59:28,233
- Adrienne.
- He's here.

793
00:59:28,316 --> 00:59:29,692
Who's here?

794
00:59:31,027 --> 00:59:32,362
Adrienne.

795
00:59:48,670 --> 00:59:50,088
Adrienne, talk to me.

796
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,767
Wake up. Hey!

797
01:00:03,768 --> 01:00:06,521
Hey, wake up. Adrienne.

798
01:00:09,732 --> 01:00:12,277
Adrienne, wake up.
Adrienne, wake up.

799
01:00:13,278 --> 01:00:14,487
Wake up!

800
01:00:16,823 --> 01:00:19,867
Fuck. Don't do that to me, please.

801
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:25,623
I don't know how to help you.

802
01:00:27,166 --> 01:00:28,668
This is bigger than me.

803
01:00:31,754 --> 01:00:32,854
You saw it.

804
01:00:35,091 --> 01:00:36,926
No, I didn't see anything.

805
01:00:42,724 --> 01:00:44,600
Let's get you out of this thing.

806
01:01:09,167 --> 01:01:10,293
I give up.

807
01:01:12,295 --> 01:01:14,255
I can't do this anymore.

808
01:01:38,654 --> 01:01:39,822
Wait.

809
01:01:58,091 --> 01:01:59,926
Okay.

810
01:02:00,009 --> 01:02:03,221
I guess I'll go avoid your mom.

811
01:04:03,674 --> 01:04:05,259
Go away.

812
01:04:06,427 --> 01:04:07,527
I can't.

813
01:04:09,096 --> 01:04:11,849
- You can't help me.
- What if you're wrong?

814
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:19,232
Adrienne.

815
01:04:19,315 --> 01:04:22,652
You want this to be the truth
Ellie has to live with her whole life?

816
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:30,826
Don't talk to me about truth.

817
01:04:37,959 --> 01:04:39,502
You were right about Shea.

818
01:04:46,884 --> 01:04:48,219
What you saw.

819
01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:01,983
Look, it's a job, a well-paid job.

820
01:05:02,066 --> 01:05:04,402
- We can't afford to both take time off.
- Oh, my...

821
01:05:04,485 --> 01:05:06,737
No, you look, Matteo.

822
01:05:06,821 --> 01:05:10,700
You brought this baby
into the world, a bastard.

823
01:05:10,783 --> 01:05:13,452
- Mom.
- Well, she is. You did that.

824
01:05:13,536 --> 01:05:14,745
It's the truth.

825
01:05:14,829 --> 01:05:17,331
And now you turn your back on her?

826
01:05:17,415 --> 01:05:20,001
Look, Patty, go fuck yourself. Okay?

827
01:05:20,084 --> 01:05:21,502
- Matteo!
- What?

828
01:05:21,586 --> 01:05:24,130
- You're gonna defend her crap?
- Mom. Mom.

829
01:05:24,213 --> 01:05:26,382
- Please--
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Adrienne.

830
01:05:26,465 --> 01:05:27,925
I can't be around this.

831
01:05:28,926 --> 01:05:30,845
Thank fucking God!

832
01:05:30,928 --> 01:05:32,930
Are you kidding me?

833
01:05:33,014 --> 01:05:36,559
That was the only help I had,
the only person I had.

834
01:05:36,642 --> 01:05:38,269
Please, stop being dramatic, okay?

835
01:05:38,352 --> 01:05:39,452
Me?

836
01:05:41,063 --> 01:05:44,859
You're the one who left. You're the one
who couldn't handle it.

837
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:08,674
And I stood there forever,
just hoping you would come back.

838
01:06:17,808 --> 01:06:20,102
Slow down, or you're going to get
in an accident.

839
01:06:20,186 --> 01:06:23,981
I didn't. I just needed an escape.

840
01:06:28,152 --> 01:06:30,905
I was afraid of being like my stepfather.

841
01:06:31,906 --> 01:06:34,116
Of family, of all of it.

842
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:36,827
All my life trying
to avoid becoming that man,

843
01:06:36,911 --> 01:06:39,497
and here I am, just turning into him.

844
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:41,957
But you're not him.
You're nothing like him.

845
01:06:42,041 --> 01:06:45,252
And when I got back to you,
I swear, nothing happened

846
01:06:45,336 --> 01:06:47,213
because I was afraid you would...

847
01:06:48,547 --> 01:06:51,509
I was afraid
I would lose you if I told you.

848
01:06:56,597 --> 01:06:57,932
Tell me now.

849
01:07:34,844 --> 01:07:36,804
And then...

850
01:07:36,887 --> 01:07:38,055
And then what?

851
01:07:39,765 --> 01:07:40,975
And then, I stopped.

852
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:45,688
Because I felt like you were there.

853
01:07:46,689 --> 01:07:48,274
Like you were right there.

854
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:51,944
And I couldn't be anything but yours.

855
01:07:54,405 --> 01:07:56,073
It was never clearer to me.

856
01:07:57,742 --> 01:08:02,747
I was just so ashamed of lying
and of failing.

857
01:08:07,418 --> 01:08:10,921
I should have been honest
about feeling overwhelmed.

858
01:08:11,922 --> 01:08:13,132
I should have stayed.

859
01:08:17,344 --> 01:08:19,889
I should have stood up for you
with my mom. I just--

860
01:08:21,182 --> 01:08:22,725
No wonder you left.

861
01:08:22,808 --> 01:08:25,144
I just made it so hard for you to love me.

862
01:08:25,227 --> 01:08:26,520
No.

863
01:08:26,604 --> 01:08:30,316
I was always tearing it down
and pulling you apart.

864
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:32,151
No.

865
01:08:32,234 --> 01:08:33,402
Liar.

866
01:08:38,282 --> 01:08:40,034
We just had so little time.

867
01:09:02,765 --> 01:09:04,391
I should have loved you better.

868
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:07,520
We still have time.

869
01:09:10,606 --> 01:09:12,233
We just got to hold on to it.

870
01:09:14,902 --> 01:09:16,779
Even if it gets messy and hard.

871
01:09:19,406 --> 01:09:21,116
Take the good and the bad.

872
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:22,993
For better or worse.

873
01:09:25,871 --> 01:09:27,122
Give me your hand.

874
01:09:29,542 --> 01:09:30,751
Give me your hand.

875
01:09:32,211 --> 01:09:33,311
Please.

876
01:10:12,710 --> 01:10:14,920
Do you remember the day we got married?

877
01:10:17,089 --> 01:10:18,189
What?

878
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:22,610
Marry me.

879
01:10:25,055 --> 01:10:26,599
It's too late.

880
01:10:26,682 --> 01:10:28,684
No. No, no, no.

881
01:10:29,685 --> 01:10:31,186
Just say yes.

882
01:10:36,692 --> 01:10:37,792
Marry me.

883
01:10:41,030 --> 01:10:42,364
Yes.

884
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:05,054
<i>Adrienne, you are my best friend.</i>

885
01:11:05,137 --> 01:11:07,431
<i>Matteo, you are my calm and my truth.</i>

886
01:11:07,514 --> 01:11:10,225
<i>My strength, my compass.</i>

887
01:11:10,309 --> 01:11:13,103
<i>I promise to have the patience
that love demands.</i>

888
01:11:13,187 --> 01:11:15,564
<i>I promise to be always yours.</i>

889
01:11:15,648 --> 01:11:19,401
<i>You know I don't believe
in soulmates, but...</i>

890
01:11:19,485 --> 01:11:22,071
I married you the minute I met you.

891
01:11:22,154 --> 01:11:27,242
And loving you is the closest thing
to faith I've ever known.

892
01:11:27,326 --> 01:11:31,246
I promise to love you and let you love me.

893
01:11:34,083 --> 01:11:37,252
I promise to always be the person
who earns your love.

894
01:11:40,923 --> 01:11:43,926
I... that one.

895
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:46,220
I give you my hand.

896
01:11:47,221 --> 01:11:49,223
I give you my hand.

897
01:11:50,432 --> 01:11:51,809
I give you my heart.

898
01:11:52,810 --> 01:11:53,978
I give you my heart.

899
01:11:55,896 --> 01:11:57,439
From this day forward...

900
01:11:57,523 --> 01:12:01,068
From this day forward
for the rest of our lives.

901
01:12:01,151 --> 01:12:03,654
For the rest of our lives.

902
01:12:03,737 --> 01:12:07,324
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

903
01:12:17,001 --> 01:12:18,669
And one for tomorrow.

904
01:12:35,102 --> 01:12:37,896
- You see? I'm dancing.
- I can't believe it.

905
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:40,065
Will wonders never cease?

906
01:12:41,775 --> 01:12:43,694
Look. Even the she-beast is happy.

907
01:12:44,695 --> 01:12:46,697
Now I know it's a dream.

908
01:12:55,164 --> 01:12:57,791
- You know how I feel?
- Hmm?

909
01:12:59,334 --> 01:13:00,335
Alive.

910
01:13:00,419 --> 01:13:02,171
- Really?
- Yeah.

911
01:13:04,006 --> 01:13:05,883
Oh, say it again. Say it again.

912
01:13:05,966 --> 01:13:07,634
I feel alive.

913
01:13:10,471 --> 01:13:12,306
You are alive, so alive.

914
01:13:12,389 --> 01:13:14,475
It makes sense. My ribs are killing me.

915
01:13:14,558 --> 01:13:16,602
- I'm sorry.
- Stop pressing on them.

916
01:13:16,685 --> 01:13:19,188
I'm sorry.

917
01:13:19,271 --> 01:13:21,356
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Ow.

918
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,983
Thank God for seat belts.

919
01:13:25,319 --> 01:13:27,237
I'm so happy you were right.

920
01:13:29,531 --> 01:13:32,034
- Can you say that again?
- What?

921
01:13:32,117 --> 01:13:34,912
- The-the part where I'm right.
- Oh.

922
01:13:34,995 --> 01:13:37,247
You were right! You're right!

923
01:13:37,331 --> 01:13:39,083
I'm so grateful.

924
01:13:40,542 --> 01:13:41,877
I'm so lucky.

925
01:13:44,254 --> 01:13:45,354
Me too.

926
01:14:02,147 --> 01:14:03,247
Hello, baby.

927
01:14:04,024 --> 01:14:06,777
You're so strong. You're so strong.

928
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:08,946
You gave us quite a scare,
you know.

929
01:14:09,029 --> 01:14:11,990
- I'm feeling better now.
- Well, you're a strong girl too.

930
01:14:12,074 --> 01:14:14,076
You know, Matteo really helped me.

931
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:17,579
I know he doesn't share your beliefs,
but he's a pretty extraordinary person.

932
01:14:17,663 --> 01:14:19,599
- I don't want to speak--
- Can we not do this right now?

933
01:14:19,623 --> 01:14:20,624
I'm just saying that there is no reason

934
01:14:20,707 --> 01:14:23,710
why he couldn't take care of Ellie
on his own if he needed to.

935
01:14:23,794 --> 01:14:25,897
- You don't have to attack me.
- I'm not attacking you.

936
01:14:25,921 --> 01:14:27,381
- Adrienne.
- Maggie.

937
01:14:27,464 --> 01:14:29,341
- Maggie.
- Needs to get changed anyhow.

938
01:14:29,424 --> 01:14:31,426
- Come on, baby.
- Hi.

939
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:32,845
Oh, my gosh.

940
01:14:32,928 --> 01:14:34,388
Think you're still in shock?

941
01:14:34,471 --> 01:14:36,348
You know, I actually thought I was dead.

942
01:14:36,431 --> 01:14:38,767
- Oh, honey. I'm so sorry.
- Dead.

943
01:14:38,851 --> 01:14:40,185
I just feel really raw.

944
01:14:40,269 --> 01:14:42,396
Yeah, that's totally normal.

945
01:14:42,479 --> 01:14:46,441
You know what? I'm here for you, okay?
Whatever you need.

946
01:14:46,525 --> 01:14:50,779
Right now, we have to get you dressed
because you have a doctor's appointment.

947
01:14:50,863 --> 01:14:52,114
Okay, Mom.

948
01:14:52,197 --> 01:14:55,409
<i>This is Matteo.
Leave a message and I'll call you back.</i>

949
01:14:55,492 --> 01:14:59,163
Hey, where'd you go?
We should be home by...

950
01:15:02,499 --> 01:15:05,502
Sorry. Home by 2:00. Call me.

951
01:15:10,174 --> 01:15:11,633
How are you feeling?

952
01:15:12,926 --> 01:15:15,220
Like I don't want to be in a car.

953
01:15:15,304 --> 01:15:18,515
I heard you talking
with Maggie, and I just...

954
01:15:18,599 --> 01:15:21,393
I'm glad that you have her
to process with.

955
01:15:22,436 --> 01:15:24,062
Yeah, she's amazing.

956
01:15:27,357 --> 01:15:28,859
I'm not good at these things.

957
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:32,154
That's okay. That's okay.

958
01:15:32,237 --> 01:15:34,114
I haven't known what to say.

959
01:15:34,198 --> 01:15:36,658
I've been trying
to find the words, but I...

960
01:15:38,452 --> 01:15:40,662
I cook and I clean,
and that's what I can do.

961
01:15:41,663 --> 01:15:43,916
It's okay, Mom. I'm okay.

962
01:15:46,168 --> 01:15:48,921
Got to take the good
with the bad, right? That's life.

963
01:15:52,466 --> 01:15:54,009
For better or worse.

964
01:15:57,221 --> 01:16:00,349
<i>I am just... I'm just so sorry.</i>

965
01:16:04,019 --> 01:16:07,105
As a parent, all you want to do
is protect your children.

966
01:16:18,158 --> 01:16:20,077
And right now,
I feel this for you,

967
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:23,038
the same way
that you will feel Ellie's pain.

968
01:16:24,122 --> 01:16:25,249
What?

969
01:16:32,464 --> 01:16:34,925
Stop. Stop the car.

970
01:16:35,008 --> 01:16:36,134
- Jesus!
- Honey!

971
01:16:36,218 --> 01:16:38,428
- What are you doing? Come back here!
- Adrienne!

972
01:17:36,528 --> 01:17:40,073
Hey. It's over now. Okay?
I'm going to get you out of here.

973
01:17:44,953 --> 01:17:49,458
Is the baby in the car? Where's the baby?
Hey, where's the baby?

974
01:17:51,209 --> 01:17:53,128
Come on.

975
01:18:16,651 --> 01:18:17,903
I know you.

976
01:18:22,657 --> 01:18:24,993
You're the lady whose husband died
in that accident.

977
01:18:27,496 --> 01:18:28,596
What?

978
01:18:31,249 --> 01:18:32,584
What did you just say?

979
01:18:37,422 --> 01:18:38,757
Hey, are you okay?

980
01:18:40,467 --> 01:18:41,760
I can't-- I can't breathe.

981
01:18:43,053 --> 01:18:44,471
I can't breathe.

982
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:02,572
Sit down. Hey.

983
01:19:04,616 --> 01:19:05,867
I can't breathe.

984
01:19:08,078 --> 01:19:09,798
Are you okay?
Are you okay? Can you hear me?

985
01:19:09,830 --> 01:19:12,707
Where's Matteo? Where's Matteo?

986
01:19:12,791 --> 01:19:13,891
Breathe. Just breathe.

987
01:19:13,959 --> 01:19:16,920
Just breathe. Just breathe.

988
01:19:17,003 --> 01:19:19,714
You're okay. Breathe. It's okay.
Just breathe. Just relax. Relax.

989
01:19:53,081 --> 01:19:54,458
Hey, sit down.

990
01:19:55,459 --> 01:19:56,877
Sit down--

991
01:19:58,879 --> 01:20:00,338
- You took him!
- What?

992
01:20:00,422 --> 01:20:03,008
- You-- You took him!
- What? No!

993
01:20:03,091 --> 01:20:04,468
You took him!

994
01:20:04,551 --> 01:20:08,555
Look! I tried to save him,
okay? I'm sorry.

995
01:20:08,638 --> 01:20:11,141
It was-- He was already gone.

996
01:20:12,142 --> 01:20:13,894
No.

997
01:20:13,977 --> 01:20:17,230
Adrienne! Hey! Hey!

998
01:20:17,314 --> 01:20:18,732
No!

999
01:20:18,815 --> 01:20:20,567
- Adrienne, come here.
- I'm sorry.

1000
01:20:20,650 --> 01:20:22,736
No, no. no. Come here. Come on.

1001
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:28,700
It's all right. It's all right.

1002
01:20:28,783 --> 01:20:30,827
Don't worry.

1003
01:20:30,911 --> 01:20:32,287
There you go. Be careful.

1004
01:20:35,582 --> 01:20:40,504
There we go. There we go.
We'll go home. We'll go home.

1005
01:20:55,018 --> 01:20:56,144
How did it go?

1006
01:21:01,233 --> 01:21:02,359
Adrienne?

1007
01:21:07,864 --> 01:21:09,241
Adrienne?

1008
01:21:44,734 --> 01:21:46,027
Adrienne.

1009
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:50,323
Please don't-- don't touch me.

1010
01:21:50,407 --> 01:21:52,409
- Slow down. Okay?
- Honey, honey.

1011
01:21:52,492 --> 01:21:53,785
It's okay.

1012
01:22:01,251 --> 01:22:02,351
What?

1013
01:22:04,421 --> 01:22:05,547
I had him.

1014
01:22:05,630 --> 01:22:08,133
He was right here.
I had him in my bed.

1015
01:22:08,216 --> 01:22:10,635
- He was right here. He was in my--
- Oh, honey.

1016
01:22:13,221 --> 01:22:16,933
I was the one that got hurt.
He was fine. He was fine.

1017
01:22:17,017 --> 01:22:18,643
Should I call Father Richard?

1018
01:22:18,727 --> 01:22:22,772
Just get him to bring him back. Can he
bring him back, please?

1019
01:22:22,856 --> 01:22:27,777
I need him to come back. Please, Mom.

1020
01:22:28,778 --> 01:22:30,155
I can't.

1021
01:22:37,746 --> 01:22:40,332
Can I have a minute, Mom?

1022
01:22:40,415 --> 01:22:44,961
Of course. I'll be right here
if you need me, okay?

1023
01:22:46,004 --> 01:22:47,172
You just...

1024
01:22:50,216 --> 01:22:51,551
You just rest.

1025
01:23:23,041 --> 01:23:24,334
Come back to me.

1026
01:23:45,397 --> 01:23:48,024
Come back to me.

1027
01:23:49,025 --> 01:23:50,902
Come back to me.

1028
01:24:54,841 --> 01:24:57,427
<i>Nurse practitioner Ramon
to the Family Birth Center,</i>

1029
01:24:57,510 --> 01:24:59,095
<i>Room 4, please.</i>

1030
01:24:59,179 --> 01:25:04,267
<i>Nurse practitioner Ramon to the Family
Birth Center, Room 4, please.</i>

1031
01:26:04,369 --> 01:26:05,995
She's still sleeping.

1032
01:26:06,079 --> 01:26:07,580
Are you ready to eat?

1033
01:26:08,581 --> 01:26:11,042
She hasn't had anything.

1034
01:26:11,125 --> 01:26:15,088
I mean, they gave her some sugar water IV,

1035
01:26:15,171 --> 01:26:17,340
but she's mostly sleeping on and off.

1036
01:26:20,593 --> 01:26:21,803
Come here.

1037
01:26:57,213 --> 01:26:58,590
I know.

1038
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:27,702
Whoosh!

1039
01:27:31,039 --> 01:27:34,042
Come for a walk.

1040
01:27:35,043 --> 01:27:36,143
Look.

1041
01:27:38,004 --> 01:27:40,089
It's Daddy's chair. Should we have a rock?

1042
01:28:01,694 --> 01:28:04,739
What do you think? The black one?

1043
01:28:06,407 --> 01:28:08,868
What are you doing, you little monkey?

1044
01:28:16,376 --> 01:28:17,476
Blow a kiss.

1045
01:28:19,879 --> 01:28:21,297
Matteo was unassuming.

1046
01:28:22,423 --> 01:28:24,884
He was kind and good.

1047
01:28:25,885 --> 01:28:31,891
If he was here now, he would tell you that
there's no reason for this, no purpose.

1048
01:28:32,892 --> 01:28:34,852
Except what we make of it.

1049
01:28:46,197 --> 01:28:49,117
Mommy, I'm up. I'm up.

1050
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:51,953
- I'm awake.
- I'm up. I'm up. I'm up.

1051
01:28:54,998 --> 01:28:57,000
- I'm up.
- I know.

1052
01:28:57,083 --> 01:28:58,626
Yoink.

1053
01:28:58,710 --> 01:29:03,381
Come here, munchkin. Come here.

1054
01:29:03,464 --> 01:29:04,882
T-bear.

1055
01:29:06,384 --> 01:29:09,887
I'll get it. I can do it.
I can do it. I can do it.

1056
01:29:09,971 --> 01:29:11,472
Okay. See who it is.

1057
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,503
Dolphins, where are you?

1058
01:29:42,587 --> 01:29:45,214
They're coming. They'll be here.

1059
01:29:55,141 --> 01:29:57,602
Keep your eyes open.

1060
01:30:21,125 --> 01:30:22,811
Here they come!
Here they come! Here they come!

1061
01:30:22,835 --> 01:30:24,295
Pretty dolphins!

1062
01:30:24,378 --> 01:30:28,257
- Hello, dolphin! Hello!
- Look! Hello!

1063
01:30:53,366 --> 01:30:55,535
- Hold on tight, okay?
- Okay.

1064
01:31:13,803 --> 01:31:15,054
Goodbye.
