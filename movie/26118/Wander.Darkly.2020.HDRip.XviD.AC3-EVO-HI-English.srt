00:00:47,774 --> 00:00:50,877
- Hey. Shh.
- [crying]

3
00:00:52,477 --> 00:00:53,946
Hey.

4
00:00:58,717 --> 00:01:00,318
You're all better now.

5
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,654
You're safe.

00:02:35,748 --> 00:02:36,916

9
00:02:43,488 --> 00:02:44,924
What do you think?
The black one?

10
00:02:49,929 --> 00:02:55,667
Where in the fu...
heck is your daddy?

11
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,036
Should we go find him?

12
00:02:58,771 --> 00:03:01,741
Daddy? Where are you?

13
00:03:01,774 --> 00:03:03,675
[buzzing]

14
00:03:13,585 --> 00:03:16,923
Now? Hello?

15
00:03:16,956 --> 00:03:18,157
[buzzing stops]

16
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,126
- You chose now to do this?
- Oh, hey.

17
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,628
- <i>Gordita.</i> Come to Papa.
- [cries]

18
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:25,798
Even though
you shouldn't be here.

19
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,168
- It's too dusty for you.
- [crying]

20
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:32,537
Daddy's the only one who gets to
hide away in this man cave of his.

21
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:33,605
I know.

22
00:03:33,638 --> 00:03:34,874
You going somewhere?

23
00:03:37,777 --> 00:03:39,812
No, we are going somewhere.

24
00:03:40,612 --> 00:03:42,580
Yeah, no. I'm ready.

25
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:52,959
[whistling]

26
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,596
You know what?
I'm sorry, okay?

27
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,132
I'm sorry
I forgot our date night.

28
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,767
Forget it.

29
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:07,706
[sighs]

30
00:04:08,941 --> 00:04:12,178
Could you please
just not sigh?

31
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:14,914
[scoffs] Really? Okay.

32
00:04:14,947 --> 00:04:18,184
You don't honestly expect me to believe
that you forgot your own argument

33
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:21,087
about how date night was cheaper
than therapy, do you?

34
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,890
Right, like you forgot we agreed your
mom wasn't allowed in our house anymore.

35
00:04:24,924 --> 00:04:28,027
We're broke. I don't see you
finding a free babysitter.

36
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,562
- [man] I would have. What?
- [scoffs]

37
00:04:31,964 --> 00:04:34,166
Don't start this
right now, please.

38
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:38,971
Can we just try to have fun?

39
00:04:39,005 --> 00:04:41,774
We're out, okay?
Let's just try.

40
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:46,145
It's kind of cool to be out
after dark, you know?

41
00:04:46,178 --> 00:04:50,715
Childless people do this all the time.
Gets dark and they go out.

42
00:04:52,051 --> 00:04:55,955
All the neon lights.
It's like a fucking video game.

43
00:04:55,988 --> 00:04:58,157
It's like... like <i>Tron.</i>

44
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,826
[both chuckle]

45
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,996
- Hey. We're so glad you could make it.
- [woman] Thanks for having us.

46
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,831
- [man] Wow.
- [woman] This place is beautiful.

47
00:05:05,865 --> 00:05:08,034
Matteo and Adrienne just bought
the house down the street.

48
00:05:08,067 --> 00:05:09,735
- But they...
- [Matteo] Thank you. Yeah.

49
00:05:09,769 --> 00:05:12,637
But they can't move in
until, what, next October?

50
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:15,741
Yeah, there's this co-op
living community renting it.

51
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:19,945
- It's, like, eight kids in their 20s.
- It's, like, ten kids, actually.

52
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:21,947
Mm. I'm sure someone's sleeping
in the laundry room.

53
00:05:21,981 --> 00:05:24,050
- Ew!
- It's kind of fun. Come on.

54
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,218
Shared space, you know.
Cooking, cleaning.

55
00:05:26,252 --> 00:05:28,988
- Life on the porch with a ukulele.
- [man] Excuse me.

56
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:31,223
[Matteo] We showed up
for inspection with our baby.

57
00:05:31,257 --> 00:05:34,160
She was, what, like,
seven days old.

58
00:05:34,193 --> 00:05:36,996
- Yeah. So little...
- [Matteo chuckles] We scared them shitless.

59
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:38,964
Married people with babies.
Run!

60
00:05:38,998 --> 00:05:40,933
We're not married. No.

61
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:43,701
[man 1] I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to assume.

62
00:05:43,736 --> 00:05:46,372
No, we just... We've got the
house and the baby, and so...

63
00:05:46,405 --> 00:05:49,875
Also, like, a new marriage,
whatever, it's like...

64
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:51,744
[man 2] Totally.
We wouldn't have done it, honestly,

65
00:05:51,777 --> 00:05:53,645
except my family
would've killed me.

66
00:05:53,678 --> 00:05:55,915
No, you mean me. They would've
cut my dick off with a machete.

67
00:05:55,948 --> 00:05:57,249
Oh. [chuckles] Ow!

68
00:05:57,283 --> 00:05:59,285
And I thought
Adrienne's mom hated me.

69
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:02,121
I mean, she does,
but more in a

70
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:04,890
"I'm praying to God to curse
your eternal soul" kind of way.

71
00:06:04,924 --> 00:06:07,393
When she comes to the
house, we play this game

72
00:06:07,426 --> 00:06:09,829
where we pretend we can't
see or hear each other.

73
00:06:09,862 --> 00:06:11,230
Very pleasant.

74
00:06:11,263 --> 00:06:13,232
Okay, excuse me.

75
00:06:15,134 --> 00:06:16,668
Liam?

76
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:17,970
- Hey!
- Hey!

77
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,939
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

78
00:06:19,972 --> 00:06:22,007
[Adrienne] I'm good.
I haven't seen you here in so long.

79
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,989
I guess now I know
why you wanted to come so badly.

80
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:40,392
I had no idea that
he was going to be there, okay?

81
00:06:40,426 --> 00:06:44,363
And God forbid I have friends.
You certainly have friends, right?

82
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,909
You know,
we both deserve to be happy.

83
00:06:56,942 --> 00:06:58,676
[scoffs] Liam makes you happy?

84
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,312
I didn't say that.
Are you happy?

85
00:07:00,346 --> 00:07:02,047
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

86
00:07:02,081 --> 00:07:04,150
Oh, that's convincing.

87
00:07:04,183 --> 00:07:06,684
We agreed not to do anything
crazy in the first year.

88
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,387
We just have to get through
the first year.

89
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,756
I don't want to just get through it.
I want to enjoy it.

90
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:12,825
- You want to control it.
- What choice do I have?

91
00:07:12,858 --> 00:07:14,894
I'm dragging you
through the motions of our life.

92
00:07:14,927 --> 00:07:18,164
Your life. You wanted to have a
baby, we had a baby.

93
00:07:18,197 --> 00:07:20,766
You wanted a house, we bought the house.
What now?

94
00:07:21,367 --> 00:07:23,068
How about the truth?

95
00:07:24,837 --> 00:07:28,040
- [scoffs] Don't.
- You can't do it.

96
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,910
No, you want me to make up
some pretend confession

97
00:07:30,943 --> 00:07:33,212
to justify your paranoia,
and I won't do that.

98
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,048
Yeah, right.

99
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,317
[Matteo] You're not gonna
be happy till you're miserable.

100
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:41,053
[Adrienne] You know, I just... I actually...
Honestly, I do not know what the point is.

101
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,720
Of life?

102
00:07:42,755 --> 00:07:46,058
Of us. Why are we
even together anymore?

103
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:50,062
[Matteo scoffs]

104
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,299
We...

105
00:07:53,332 --> 00:07:56,701
We have a newborn baby.
We just closed escrow. What?

106
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:00,072
Now what?
You want to split up?

107
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:01,774
I want to...

00:12:59,271 --> 00:13:04,076
Like I could reach into the hourglass and
stir the sands and just change it all.

160
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,278
[sniffles]

161
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,715
No, I'm sorry. I...

162
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:12,284
I can't do this. Sorry.

163
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:14,219
Sorry.

164
00:13:20,225 --> 00:13:21,393
Poor thing.

165
00:13:21,995 --> 00:13:23,362
I'm gonna go check on him.

166
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:27,266
- [priest] "Love is patient, love is kind."
- Shea!

167
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:30,536
- "It does not envy, it does not boast."
- Shea!

168
00:13:30,569 --> 00:13:33,672
Let's let the body
cool off first, okay?

169
00:13:33,705 --> 00:13:35,474
[Adrienne's mom]
It's better this way.

170
00:13:36,475 --> 00:13:41,079
- My sweet girl. See all the toys.
- [Ellie babbles]

171
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:43,750
Yeah! So many pretty toys.

172
00:13:47,386 --> 00:13:50,155
See, this is Ellie's room now,

173
00:13:50,188 --> 00:13:53,292
and we're gonna do
just great. Mm.

174
00:13:54,861 --> 00:13:57,129
Aw.

175
00:13:57,162 --> 00:14:01,266
Ellie Bellie, you're gonna live
with Grandma and Grandpa now.

176
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:07,406
[sings lullaby]

177
00:14:16,682 --> 00:14:18,250
Look at you.

178
00:14:21,553 --> 00:14:23,221
- Grandma?
- Hmm?

179
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,659
Do you really think
she loved my dad?

180
00:14:27,693 --> 00:14:30,763
Are those my journals? Oh, God, no. Fuck.
Don't... Please don't look at those.

181
00:14:30,797 --> 00:14:35,267
[Adrienne's mom] I think
your dad was hard to love.

182
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,568
[sobbing]

183
00:14:36,602 --> 00:14:37,870
Stop now.

184
00:14:37,904 --> 00:14:41,440
It's not your fault
your father left.

185
00:14:41,473 --> 00:14:46,278
Now, tears won't solve anything.
They won't bring him back.

186
00:14:46,913 --> 00:14:49,715
Bring him back
from where?

187
00:14:49,749 --> 00:14:52,752
Where is your dad?
Where the shit is your dad?

188
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,555
[echoing] Matteo?

189
00:15:48,674 --> 00:15:51,343
[Matteo]
Hey! Adrienne!

190
00:15:51,376 --> 00:15:53,746
Come down.
What are you doing?

191
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:56,648
You can see me.

192
00:15:56,682 --> 00:15:58,417
What?

193
00:15:59,752 --> 00:16:01,788
I died.

194
00:16:01,821 --> 00:16:04,824
- I died, Matteo.
- Okay.

195
00:16:04,857 --> 00:16:08,828
It's so wrong that that was it.
It was just headlights and a half gasp...

196
00:16:08,861 --> 00:16:09,962
Stop. Stop.

197
00:16:10,797 --> 00:16:14,533
You're confused.
We had an accident.

198
00:16:15,534 --> 00:16:17,402
Oh, my God,
you're dead too.

199
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:18,704
What? No!

200
00:16:18,738 --> 00:16:20,740
No, I'm not.

201
00:16:21,473 --> 00:16:22,708
And you're not.

202
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:24,744
How do you know?

203
00:16:26,478 --> 00:16:27,947
Because I know.

204
00:16:28,981 --> 00:16:30,783
Well, because we're here.

205
00:16:32,484 --> 00:16:35,988
I mean, spending eternity
on the 10 Freeway...

206
00:16:36,022 --> 00:16:37,656
What did we do
to deserve that?

207
00:16:41,027 --> 00:16:43,495
You weren't there with Ellie.

208
00:16:43,528 --> 00:16:45,732
Where do you go?

209
00:16:45,765 --> 00:16:49,736
What happens to you? You just get scared
and then, what, you just... you disappear?

210
00:16:50,368 --> 00:16:52,437
You concussed. That's it.

211
00:16:53,438 --> 00:16:55,707
No. I'm dead.

212
00:16:55,742 --> 00:16:57,910
- I could step into traffic now. It wouldn't matter.
- Hey!

213
00:16:57,944 --> 00:16:58,911
[tires screech]

214
00:16:59,544 --> 00:17:00,645
Hey.

215
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:04,016
It's okay.

216
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:07,586
What is this, like, purgatory?
What's happening to me?

217
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,354
Just hold on to me. Hmm?

218
00:17:18,097 --> 00:17:21,901
[Ellie babbling]

219
00:17:21,934 --> 00:17:25,370
[Ellie crying]

220
00:17:25,403 --> 00:17:27,672
[Adrienne's mom] We just want
what's best for Ellie.

221
00:17:27,706 --> 00:17:29,976
We can't leave her here, Steve.

222
00:17:30,009 --> 00:17:33,345
[Steve] If she had
just left instructions

223
00:17:33,378 --> 00:17:36,048
for what she would've wanted
in a situation like this.

224
00:17:36,082 --> 00:17:38,416
[Adrienne's mom] She would
want us to take care of Ellie.

225
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,484
What about Matteo?

226
00:17:40,787 --> 00:17:43,622
God forgive me,
but this is all his fault.

227
00:17:43,655 --> 00:17:46,025
He couldn't take care of her.
He wouldn't marry her.

228
00:17:46,058 --> 00:17:47,960
He couldn't protect her,
and now she's...

229
00:17:47,994 --> 00:17:50,096
[Steve] I don't think we
should get ahead of ourselves.

230
00:17:50,129 --> 00:17:52,330
[Adrienne's mom]
We should take the baby home.

231
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,902
[pounding]

232
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,939
[screams, panting]
Shit!

233
00:18:32,972 --> 00:18:34,774
What? What happened?

234
00:18:35,741 --> 00:18:40,612
There was somebody outside.
I thought I saw some...

235
00:18:40,645 --> 00:18:44,616
Outside? It was me.
I was outside.

236
00:18:44,649 --> 00:18:47,385
The door was locked.
I had to go around the house.

237
00:18:52,058 --> 00:18:53,759
Hey.

238
00:18:53,793 --> 00:18:56,528
I don't know how much time
I have left here, Matteo.

239
00:18:57,196 --> 00:18:58,965
Well, none of us do, right?

240
00:18:58,998 --> 00:19:00,632
It's part of the mystery.

241
00:19:00,665 --> 00:19:02,802
I heard them talking.
They're gonna take Ellie.

242
00:19:02,835 --> 00:19:03,870
- Who said...
- My mother.

243
00:19:03,903 --> 00:19:05,938
- I just heard them.
- [scoffs]

244
00:19:08,107 --> 00:19:11,010
I'm perfectly capable of taking
care of my family, Patty.

245
00:19:11,043 --> 00:19:13,511
Thank you very much.
[scoffs]

246
00:19:13,545 --> 00:19:14,814
As if it was my fault.

247
00:19:16,015 --> 00:19:18,851
Hey. We got
to get you better, okay?

248
00:19:18,885 --> 00:19:22,687
But no one is taking our baby.
Okay?

249
00:19:25,191 --> 00:19:26,658
Hey. Come.

250
00:19:27,525 --> 00:19:28,728
Come, come.

251
00:19:30,162 --> 00:19:34,834
It will take a pack of wolves more rabid than
your mother to take her away. All right?

252
00:19:38,204 --> 00:19:40,106
Do we even have a baby?

253
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,909
- What?
- The baby was in the car,

254
00:19:42,942 --> 00:19:45,044
but the car seat was emp...

255
00:19:45,077 --> 00:19:47,712
- Hey. You...
- Maybe I just imagined that we have a baby.

256
00:19:47,747 --> 00:19:51,117
You... You didn't want
to have a baby.

257
00:19:52,785 --> 00:19:56,488
We have a baby.
Ellie is our baby.

258
00:19:56,521 --> 00:19:59,959
She's six months old,
kinda cute.

259
00:20:00,927 --> 00:20:04,629
Remember when she was born,
that she couldn't latch?

260
00:20:05,197 --> 00:20:06,766
We were freaking out.

261
00:20:08,566 --> 00:20:11,636
And then these researchers
from Denmark came.

262
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,239
Remember what he said?

263
00:20:13,272 --> 00:20:18,244
"We're doing a study on the
benefits of..." Of what?

264
00:20:18,277 --> 00:20:21,981
Of narrative therapy
for new mothers and newborns.

265
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:24,582
You've been through
a traumatic experience,

266
00:20:24,616 --> 00:20:27,519
but you've been able to process
by talking through it.

267
00:20:28,154 --> 00:20:29,956
The birth was traumatic for you,

268
00:20:29,989 --> 00:20:31,958
but you've been able to talk
about it with your husband.

269
00:20:31,991 --> 00:20:33,125
Boyfriend.

270
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:36,561
- Sorry?
- Nothing. Nothing.

271
00:20:36,594 --> 00:20:39,832
Right. But the baby,
she has no idea what has happened.

272
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,735
She needs to process too.

273
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:47,605
You need to tell her
her story.

274
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:54,113
Um, okay.

275
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:57,016
Hey.

276
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:03,022
We had kind of
a crazy birth, huh?

277
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:06,959
It was hard,
and it was painful...

278
00:21:07,793 --> 00:21:10,628
because the cord
was wrapped around you

279
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,099
and you couldn't breathe.

280
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:15,835
[coos]

281
00:21:15,868 --> 00:21:21,073
And then all these people rushed in,
and it was bright, and it was loud,

282
00:21:21,107 --> 00:21:23,242
but those people
were helping you.

283
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,710
You weren't alone.

284
00:21:26,812 --> 00:21:29,115
And we were there
the whole time.

285
00:21:29,148 --> 00:21:32,517
We were just not breathing
with you for those 90 seconds...

286
00:21:33,618 --> 00:21:35,021
and then you did.

287
00:21:36,355 --> 00:21:38,858
You breathed.

288
00:21:38,891 --> 00:21:42,094
And I know you're so tired
from all that craziness,

289
00:21:42,128 --> 00:21:44,163
but you're all better now.

290
00:21:46,065 --> 00:21:47,632
You're safe.

291
00:21:52,238 --> 00:21:54,974
But, my baby, you've got to eat.

292
00:21:59,845 --> 00:22:01,914
[babbles]

293
00:22:07,353 --> 00:22:09,288
[sniffles] She's on.

294
00:22:12,258 --> 00:22:13,759
[chuckles]

295
00:22:29,842 --> 00:22:31,143
You see?

296
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:34,814
Remember, we have a baby.

297
00:22:39,385 --> 00:22:42,687
I'm gonna help you make sense
of everything else.

298
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,925
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna tell you our story, okay?

299
00:22:47,993 --> 00:22:51,030
That way you can know
that you're okay.

300
00:22:52,231 --> 00:22:53,866
You can know you're safe.

301
00:22:55,768 --> 00:22:57,169
What if you're wrong?

302
00:22:58,771 --> 00:23:00,773
What if it's a sad story?

303
00:23:02,441 --> 00:23:04,642
- [knocking]
- No.

304
00:23:05,444 --> 00:23:07,947
- It's not.
- [Patty] Sorry to wake you.

305
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,149
One second, Patty.

306
00:23:10,182 --> 00:23:11,750
You need anything?

307
00:23:11,784 --> 00:23:13,252
Tell her you're fine, please.

308
00:23:14,153 --> 00:23:15,421
I'm not even here.

309
00:23:15,454 --> 00:23:17,722
So she's talking to a dead girl?

310
00:23:17,756 --> 00:23:18,824
To you.

311
00:23:18,858 --> 00:23:20,059
Okay.

312
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,230
Okay, so you won't talk
to anyone for a bit. Okay?

313
00:23:24,263 --> 00:23:28,067
We'll stay here,
and we'll figure this out ourselves.

314
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,969
[Patty]
I did some laundry,

315
00:23:30,002 --> 00:23:33,038
and I was thinking
I'd make soup tonight.

316
00:23:33,072 --> 00:23:36,809
I have to go to the store,
so if you want anything...

317
00:23:36,842 --> 00:23:39,912
[Matteo] Thank you, Patty. We're fine.
Thank you. Take your time.

318
00:23:41,113 --> 00:23:43,315
Okay, let's stay in bed.

319
00:23:44,183 --> 00:23:46,684
One step at a time. Hey.

320
00:23:48,454 --> 00:23:50,389
Shall we start
from the beginning?

321
00:23:50,422 --> 00:23:51,656
Of time?

322
00:23:52,258 --> 00:23:53,359
Of us.

323
00:23:55,261 --> 00:23:56,395
Fine.

324
00:23:57,963 --> 00:24:00,933
If it means you'll stay,
then fine.

325
00:24:02,368 --> 00:24:05,037
I will stay.
Close your eyes.

326
00:24:08,908 --> 00:24:11,310
- [Adrienne] Where are we? What is it?
- [Maggie] Okay, this way.

327
00:24:11,343 --> 00:24:13,312
- Okay, all right, stop. Stop. Stop.
- I don't like it.

328
00:24:13,345 --> 00:24:16,382
- I don't want it.
- Okay, one, two, three.

329
00:24:16,415 --> 00:24:17,917
[all] Surprise!

330
00:24:19,051 --> 00:24:20,452
- [man] Yeah!
- [pop music playing]

331
00:24:20,486 --> 00:24:23,122
[both laugh]

332
00:24:23,155 --> 00:24:26,892
Oh, my God, you guys,
this is awesome.

333
00:24:26,926 --> 00:24:29,094
[chattering]

334
00:24:29,128 --> 00:24:30,362
Hey!

335
00:24:30,396 --> 00:24:31,830
What is this?

336
00:24:37,403 --> 00:24:40,806
I was so uncomfortable
in the spotlight.

337
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:43,275
- Hi!
- And I thought that was so cute.

338
00:24:43,309 --> 00:24:45,811
All these people are here
because they love you so much.

339
00:24:45,844 --> 00:24:47,346
Look, and there's
so many snacks.

340
00:24:47,379 --> 00:24:51,951
[laughter, chattering]

341
00:24:51,984 --> 00:24:55,754
[pop music continues]

342
00:25:01,794 --> 00:25:03,128
[laughs]

343
00:25:04,096 --> 00:25:05,164
[laughs]

344
00:25:13,906 --> 00:25:15,274
I remember you blushed.

345
00:25:15,307 --> 00:25:17,042
No, I didn't.

346
00:25:17,076 --> 00:25:19,411
- Okay.
- What? I didn't.

347
00:25:19,445 --> 00:25:22,381
I lured you in with my boyish charm.
That's what I did.

348
00:25:22,414 --> 00:25:24,250
[chuckles]

349
00:25:24,883 --> 00:25:28,954
Oh, yeah, this one. Shia. Sean?

350
00:25:28,988 --> 00:25:30,856
Come on. You remember her name.

351
00:25:32,024 --> 00:25:33,192
Shea.

352
00:25:34,226 --> 00:25:36,795
She was always just so much.

353
00:25:39,164 --> 00:25:41,834
She never really talked to me
after we got together.

354
00:25:42,401 --> 00:25:43,836
She talked to you.

355
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:47,206
I told you nothing happened
with Shea.

356
00:25:48,407 --> 00:25:50,309
Yeah, you did tell me that.

357
00:25:58,484 --> 00:26:00,853
[Ellie crying]

358
00:26:03,589 --> 00:26:06,458
Shea got me a job
in a hotel in Palm Springs.

359
00:26:07,059 --> 00:26:09,928
All the woodwork and doors.

360
00:26:09,962 --> 00:26:12,131
- With her?
- Just two months.

361
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,002
- [footsteps departing]
- [door unlocking]

362
00:26:20,272 --> 00:26:21,840
[door closes]

363
00:26:21,874 --> 00:26:23,342
[Matteo] <i>Hey.</i>

364
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:26,111
I haven't finished
with the night we met.

365
00:26:26,145 --> 00:26:28,180
[laughter, chattering]

366
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:30,849
You remember what
we talked about?

367
00:26:30,883 --> 00:26:33,085
[soft, slow music playing]

368
00:26:33,118 --> 00:26:35,554
- Hmm. Movies?
- <i>Aliens.</i>

369
00:26:36,322 --> 00:26:37,523
My love of show tunes.

370
00:26:37,556 --> 00:26:39,925
Yes, and yet,
I kept talking to you.

371
00:26:39,958 --> 00:26:44,096
[chuckles] And, oh, <i>The Bluest Eye.</i>
You love Toni Morrison.

372
00:26:44,129 --> 00:26:46,231
And I wanted to give you
a blow job right there.

373
00:26:46,265 --> 00:26:47,933
What? No.

374
00:26:47,966 --> 00:26:49,234
- No way.
- Way.

375
00:26:49,268 --> 00:26:52,571
- Fuck, I wish I knew.
- [chuckles]

376
00:26:53,773 --> 00:26:58,577
You were focused on me so intently
like we were the only ones there.

377
00:27:00,512 --> 00:27:04,550
- And you told me about your stepdad.
- Not that night.

378
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:07,086
No, you did.
About the last time that you saw him.

379
00:27:07,986 --> 00:27:10,222
Oh, yeah. I was ten.

380
00:27:11,657 --> 00:27:14,226
He had his hands
around my mom's neck,

381
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:17,896
so I called the cops,
and of course he denied it.

382
00:27:18,964 --> 00:27:21,200
Then my mom blamed me
when he left.

383
00:27:22,368 --> 00:27:24,036
I'm sorry.

384
00:27:24,069 --> 00:27:26,672
[scoffs, chuckles] No, I'm sorry.
What a downer.

385
00:27:26,705 --> 00:27:29,508
[both chuckle]

386
00:27:29,541 --> 00:27:34,179
My parents are a pain, but not painful
enough that I can get rid of them.

387
00:27:34,213 --> 00:27:36,315
That's too bad.

388
00:27:36,348 --> 00:27:38,117
- I mean...
- No, I mean, that's good.

389
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:40,219
It's good, I guess.
[laughs]

390
00:27:40,252 --> 00:27:41,320
- Anyway...
- Cheers.

391
00:27:49,528 --> 00:27:55,434
You can spend the night in my room
if you promise to, um, not molest me.

392
00:27:59,238 --> 00:28:02,641
- No, wait. That was weeks later.
- I remember.

393
00:28:03,575 --> 00:28:05,911
You asked to crash on my couch.

394
00:28:09,681 --> 00:28:13,252
- What time's your meeting in the morning?
- It's at 9:00.

395
00:28:14,286 --> 00:28:16,522
Thank you
for letting me stay.

396
00:28:16,555 --> 00:28:20,058
It's just that traffic in the morning,
it's crazy heading this way, so...

397
00:28:20,092 --> 00:28:21,960
I thought
it would be easier.

398
00:28:21,994 --> 00:28:24,163
Yeah, no worries.
It's fine.

399
00:28:27,065 --> 00:28:29,101
You know,
I lied about the meeting.

400
00:28:30,269 --> 00:28:31,637
There was no meeting.

401
00:28:33,338 --> 00:28:34,940
I know.

402
00:28:38,677 --> 00:28:42,214
[soft music playing]

403
00:28:42,247 --> 00:28:44,550
[both chuckle]

404
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:48,253
It was almost dawn.

405
00:28:48,287 --> 00:28:50,155
I thought you were
never gonna kiss me.

406
00:28:55,795 --> 00:28:59,498
- Oh! [chuckles]
- I tri... [chuckles] I'm sorry.

407
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:03,101
I'm sorry. Come back.
Come back. Come back. Please.

408
00:29:04,603 --> 00:29:06,773
[both chuckling]

409
00:29:06,806 --> 00:29:09,675
Mm. I'm sorry.

410
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,657
[moaning]

411
00:29:25,691 --> 00:29:27,359
Make love to me.

412
00:29:31,764 --> 00:29:33,432
You got a condom?

413
00:29:34,533 --> 00:29:36,668
- Don't you?
- No.

414
00:29:36,702 --> 00:29:38,036
[chuckles]

415
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,705
- What? You light...
- Are you serious?

416
00:29:39,739 --> 00:29:42,241
I mean, you light a hundred
candles, and you have no condom?

417
00:29:42,274 --> 00:29:44,243
I thought you'd have one.
I'm sorry.

418
00:29:44,276 --> 00:29:48,146
- No. What kind of feminist are you?
- [both laugh]

419
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,015
Wait.

420
00:29:53,786 --> 00:29:56,221
Bam. [chuckles]

421
00:29:56,255 --> 00:29:59,424
Thank God we don't use
these fucking things anymore.

422
00:29:59,458 --> 00:30:02,327
Yeah, because
we don't have sex anymore.

423
00:30:02,929 --> 00:30:05,330
No, I'm sorry. Shh, shh.

424
00:30:05,364 --> 00:30:09,268
Let's... Let's not think
about that. Focus.

425
00:30:23,415 --> 00:30:25,551
Do you smell smoke?

426
00:30:26,585 --> 00:30:28,788
[speaking Spanish]

427
00:30:28,821 --> 00:30:30,289
Fire!

428
00:30:30,322 --> 00:30:32,658
[grunts] Fuck!

429
00:30:33,325 --> 00:30:34,493
Matteo!

430
00:30:34,526 --> 00:30:36,328
Matteo!

431
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:40,165
[coughs, panting]

432
00:30:40,198 --> 00:30:41,433
You just left me there.

433
00:30:44,904 --> 00:30:47,105
You just left me there to die.

434
00:30:47,139 --> 00:30:48,574
[Matteo]
That's not what happened.

435
00:30:53,512 --> 00:30:57,683
I came back.
I came back and put it out.

436
00:30:57,716 --> 00:31:01,186
I saved the day.
I was fucking Superman that night.

437
00:31:01,854 --> 00:31:04,489
- We laughed about this.
- Yeah.

438
00:31:06,291 --> 00:31:08,160
Hey. Hey.

439
00:31:10,596 --> 00:31:12,264
I love you.

440
00:31:13,365 --> 00:31:15,500
No, I was the one
that said it first.

441
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:19,538
- Does it matter?
- Yes.

442
00:31:22,174 --> 00:31:23,776
No. I don't know.

443
00:32:11,289 --> 00:32:12,324
[gasps]

444
00:32:15,293 --> 00:32:17,529
[groaning]

445
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,604
[breathing heavily]

446
00:32:46,993 --> 00:32:48,527
There you are.

447
00:32:50,462 --> 00:32:52,464
Hey. You scared me.

448
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:55,200
I'm a good ghost.

449
00:32:57,502 --> 00:32:59,839
You promised you'd stay
with me.

450
00:32:59,872 --> 00:33:01,941
I've been doing
some research.

451
00:33:01,974 --> 00:33:05,878
It's kind of crazy what happens
to people after trauma.

452
00:33:05,912 --> 00:33:08,513
I mean, what they
experience, you know?

453
00:33:08,547 --> 00:33:10,315
Makes sense
that you feel off.

454
00:33:10,348 --> 00:33:12,885
- Off?
- Yeah.

455
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:15,755
What do you think happens
when you die?

456
00:33:16,722 --> 00:33:18,958
- Nothing.
- What if it's bad?

457
00:33:18,991 --> 00:33:24,396
Painful, some extension or manifestation
of your fears and your failings?

458
00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:27,699
- Hey.
- Of your last moments, again and again and again and again?

459
00:33:27,734 --> 00:33:29,601
No. No, no.
Uh, wait.

460
00:33:31,037 --> 00:33:34,239
It can't just be an insular
emotional repetition.

461
00:33:34,874 --> 00:33:36,541
I mean,
if it's not nothing,

462
00:33:36,575 --> 00:33:38,811
it's gotta be something bigger
than that, right?

463
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,382
We're space dust. Right?

464
00:33:44,416 --> 00:33:46,819
So we just go back to that,
to be part of everything.

465
00:33:46,853 --> 00:33:50,489
- The water, the trees.
- "Ashes to ashes, dust to dust."

466
00:33:50,522 --> 00:33:53,826
[chuckles] If you want to
get Catholic about it, yeah.

467
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:58,765
When you die, Adrienne...
but you're not dead yet.

468
00:34:00,665 --> 00:34:03,535
I think I'm here to get you to
step up and take care of Ellie.

469
00:34:03,568 --> 00:34:05,570
- We talked about this.
- I saw it, and you weren't there.

470
00:34:05,604 --> 00:34:07,774
- Hey, stop it.
- I saw her, and you weren't there.

471
00:34:07,807 --> 00:34:10,575
So maybe you were lying,
and that's why I'm stuck here.

472
00:34:10,609 --> 00:34:13,545
- I wouldn't lie about that. Wait.
- And that's why I'm still here.

473
00:34:13,578 --> 00:34:14,713
No.

474
00:34:16,414 --> 00:34:20,418
I know you're always the fixer,
always in control, but...

475
00:34:21,921 --> 00:34:23,956
you gotta trust me
on this one. Hmm?

476
00:34:25,423 --> 00:34:28,326
When I go,
you'll be a good dad.

477
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,996
- You're gonna learn to braid hair...
- Hey, stop.

478
00:34:30,029 --> 00:34:31,563
- ...and sing lullabies.
- Okay.

479
00:34:31,596 --> 00:34:33,065
- She's gonna need you.
- Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

480
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,569
Let's talk about
what's real.

481
00:34:38,603 --> 00:34:39,972
What really happened.

482
00:34:42,074 --> 00:34:43,542
Okay?

483
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,115
Mexico. A happy memory.

484
00:34:49,148 --> 00:34:50,649
[knocking]

485
00:34:53,451 --> 00:34:54,887
- It's okay.
- Don't.

486
00:34:54,921 --> 00:34:56,488
It's okay.

487
00:34:59,591 --> 00:35:00,960
[boat captain speaking Spanish]

488
00:35:00,993 --> 00:35:04,329
[waves lapping]

489
00:35:12,671 --> 00:35:15,507
- [Adrienne] I just met your family.
- [Matteo] Uh-huh.

490
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:18,577
They loved you.

491
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:20,913
I'm so glad you made us
do this trip.

492
00:35:20,947 --> 00:35:24,917
[Adrienne] Afterwards.
You were always glad afterwards.

493
00:35:24,951 --> 00:35:28,486
Well, how could I ever imagine
it was going to be so...

494
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,689
- Magical.
- It was.

495
00:35:32,158 --> 00:35:35,427
I could see our whole life,
just this...

496
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,898
beautiful adventure
carved out on the horizon.

497
00:35:40,766 --> 00:35:44,036
You made me rethink everything I
thought I knew about what I wanted.

498
00:35:59,584 --> 00:36:00,987
Will they come?

499
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,889
[Matteo]
Yeah, they're coming.

500
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:11,764
Here!

501
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,969
- [Adrienne screams]
- Whoa! Wow!

502
00:36:19,171 --> 00:36:20,672
Yay!

503
00:36:20,705 --> 00:36:21,941
[Matteo chuckles]

504
00:36:23,175 --> 00:36:26,946
- [Adrienne] Right here! Right here! Right here!
- [Matteo] Wow!

505
00:36:26,979 --> 00:36:29,414
- [Adrienne] There!
- [Matteo laughs]

506
00:36:48,034 --> 00:36:49,534
[Matteo] <i>Gracias.</i>

507
00:36:56,075 --> 00:36:57,609
And then we died...

508
00:36:58,911 --> 00:37:01,613
- <i>Hostel: Mexico,</i> straight to DVD.
- [chuckles]

509
00:37:09,822 --> 00:37:13,558
I have told this story so many times,
it's almost like it's a fantasy.

510
00:37:14,226 --> 00:37:17,163
This was real. This is real.

511
00:37:26,272 --> 00:37:28,707
[Matteo] I could stay
in this place forever.

512
00:37:29,574 --> 00:37:31,643
I so wanted you to propose.

513
00:37:32,845 --> 00:37:34,180
I was going to.

514
00:37:34,981 --> 00:37:37,216
- What?
- Yeah.

515
00:37:37,249 --> 00:37:39,551
I even looked at rings
and everything, but...

516
00:37:40,419 --> 00:37:42,654
I thought you'd be mad.
I didn't have a ring.

517
00:37:42,687 --> 00:37:44,957
No, I wouldn't have.
I wouldn't have been mad.

518
00:37:44,991 --> 00:37:46,591
[chuckles]
Yes, you would.

519
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:50,196
- [scoffs]
- Hey. Hey.

520
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:53,032
Okay, I didn't propose,
but you remember what I said?

521
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:58,938
I want to kiss you at the end of
every day for the rest of my life.

522
00:38:00,873 --> 00:38:02,640
One for yesterday...

523
00:38:04,844 --> 00:38:06,212
one for today...

524
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,614
one for tomorrow.

525
00:38:09,647 --> 00:38:11,017
[chuckles]

526
00:38:19,158 --> 00:38:21,961
It's so sad that we fell
apart, isn't it?

527
00:38:24,196 --> 00:38:25,697
Yeah.

528
00:38:33,873 --> 00:38:35,841
- [Matteo] What's wrong?
- What's happening?

529
00:38:35,875 --> 00:38:38,077
- What's happening?
- Hey.

530
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:40,046
- Adrienne. What's wrong?
- [gasps]

531
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,313
What's happening?

532
00:38:41,347 --> 00:38:44,884
- [groaning]
- Adrienne, take a breath.

533
00:38:44,917 --> 00:38:47,286
- [groaning]
- Adrienne, take a breath.

534
00:38:50,322 --> 00:38:52,091
- Adrienne!
- [gasps]

535
00:38:52,124 --> 00:38:55,127
- Okay. Breathe. Breathe.
- [groans, breathes heavily]

536
00:38:55,161 --> 00:38:57,629
- Breathe. Breathe.
- [breathes heavily]

537
00:38:58,197 --> 00:39:00,866
Breathe. Adrienne, breathe.

538
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,567
Okay. You're okay.

539
00:39:03,202 --> 00:39:04,370
You're okay.

540
00:39:04,403 --> 00:39:06,939
You keep saying that,
but clearly...

541
00:39:06,972 --> 00:39:08,808
- What's wrong?
- [groaning]

542
00:39:09,707 --> 00:39:12,710
- The water... You didn't see the water.
- What?

543
00:39:12,745 --> 00:39:15,613
[crying]

544
00:39:15,647 --> 00:39:19,985
Just breathe, please.
Breathe. You're okay.

545
00:39:21,087 --> 00:39:22,620
Look me in the eyes.

546
00:39:24,223 --> 00:39:26,058
There you go.
That works.

547
00:39:29,028 --> 00:39:31,197
[sighs]

548
00:39:32,765 --> 00:39:35,067
Okay. Okay.

549
00:39:36,902 --> 00:39:39,839
Let me get you a towel.
You'll be fine.

550
00:39:40,306 --> 00:39:42,942
Okay? Don't move.

551
00:39:44,777 --> 00:39:47,813
[breathes heavily]

552
00:39:54,153 --> 00:39:55,888
[male voice]
<i>It's over now.</i>

553
00:39:57,722 --> 00:39:59,258
<i>Where's the baby?</i>

554
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,063
No. No, you can't have her.

555
00:40:06,999 --> 00:40:08,367
Ellie?

556
00:40:10,202 --> 00:40:12,071
Ellie!

557
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,807
Please!
Somebody help me!

558
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,208
Help me!

559
00:40:16,242 --> 00:40:18,744
Somebody help me!
[crying]

560
00:40:18,777 --> 00:40:20,279
Adrienne!

561
00:40:20,312 --> 00:40:23,949
- She's not breathing!
- What is it? Stop it. Stop it.

562
00:40:23,983 --> 00:40:25,918
- [Ellie crying]
- Let Mama have the baby.

563
00:40:25,951 --> 00:40:28,754
- You're gonna hurt her. Steve!
- [Matteo] What happened?

564
00:40:28,787 --> 00:40:30,322
Let go. Let the baby go.

565
00:40:30,356 --> 00:40:33,425
- Oh...
- He can't have her! He can't have her!

566
00:40:33,459 --> 00:40:36,095
- [Steve] Is she okay?
- [Matteo] She's fine.

567
00:40:37,429 --> 00:40:40,199
- She's okay. She's okay.
- [Steve] It's okay.

568
00:40:40,232 --> 00:40:41,901
[Matteo] Adrienne,
what's going on?

569
00:40:41,934 --> 00:40:43,869
He's coming...
He's coming for her.

570
00:40:43,903 --> 00:40:46,704
[crying]

571
00:40:46,739 --> 00:40:49,875
- He's coming for her.
- What? What's coming?

572
00:40:49,909 --> 00:40:52,011
- What are you talking about?
- Dea...

573
00:40:53,179 --> 00:40:54,213
Death.

574
00:40:59,251 --> 00:41:03,122
[crying]

575
00:41:04,056 --> 00:41:06,358
[doctor] Your mom tells me
you've been experiencing

576
00:41:06,392 --> 00:41:08,794
some confusion
since the accident.

577
00:41:09,395 --> 00:41:11,297
Are you in any pain?

578
00:41:17,836 --> 00:41:19,805
- Does that hurt?
- I don't know.

579
00:41:30,816 --> 00:41:33,819
[doctor]
Adrienne, can you hear me?

580
00:41:35,454 --> 00:41:36,922
Do you know what day it is?

581
00:41:38,557 --> 00:41:40,993
Sorry, I'm not really here.

582
00:41:42,061 --> 00:41:43,429
Which one is it?

583
00:41:46,932 --> 00:41:48,500
[doctor]
She just needs her medicine.

584
00:41:48,534 --> 00:41:53,539
[indistinct]

585
00:41:53,572 --> 00:41:56,075
Take two pills,
three times a day...

586
00:42:00,512 --> 00:42:05,784
[indistinct]

587
00:42:06,952 --> 00:42:09,221
She's gonna be okay.
She's a strong girl.

588
00:42:09,255 --> 00:42:11,223
[Steve] Thanks for coming by.
I do appreciate it.

589
00:42:11,257 --> 00:42:13,292
[Ellie crying]

590
00:42:17,529 --> 00:42:20,966
Ellie wanted to say hi.
Why don't you give her a hug?

591
00:42:22,568 --> 00:42:25,004
Okay, here,
I'll take her.

592
00:42:25,037 --> 00:42:27,873
[Patty] They've got her on so many
pills, I can't even keep them straight.

593
00:42:27,906 --> 00:42:31,210
[Maggie] I'm just gonna sit here with
you, okay? Just so you know.

594
00:42:32,878 --> 00:42:34,046
We don't even have to talk.

595
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,814
[Patty]
She has physical therapy,

596
00:42:35,848 --> 00:42:38,951
and an appointment with a
psychiatrist on Tuesday.

597
00:42:38,984 --> 00:42:42,588
[Maggie] Okay, well, you know I'm here
if she needs anything. She'll be fine.

598
00:42:42,621 --> 00:42:47,092
[Patty] I'm gonna take Ellie to our place
for a while, and Steve will stay with her.

599
00:42:49,295 --> 00:42:55,334
- [babbling]
- [crashing sounds]

600
00:43:00,472 --> 00:43:06,245
Children need stability, and this just
is not a good environment for her.

601
00:43:07,112 --> 00:43:09,081
[insurance agent]
So, the good news is,

602
00:43:09,114 --> 00:43:12,484
the other driver was at fault,
per the police report.

603
00:43:16,021 --> 00:43:19,491
- Is he okay?
- He isn't claiming any injuries.

604
00:43:19,525 --> 00:43:21,994
Will you be taking
Matteo's statement separately

605
00:43:22,027 --> 00:43:26,098
to make sure we're telling the truth?
Because it was not his fault.

606
00:43:26,131 --> 00:43:29,301
No matter what
my mother may have told you.

607
00:43:30,636 --> 00:43:34,540
There was a witness who said he saw the
other driver gun through the yellow.

608
00:43:34,573 --> 00:43:36,308
Do you remember that?

609
00:43:40,979 --> 00:43:42,214
Adrienne?

610
00:43:46,352 --> 00:43:49,388
- [zombies grunting]
- [woman screams]

611
00:43:56,095 --> 00:43:57,396
Zombies?

612
00:43:58,097 --> 00:43:59,565
You hate zombies.

613
00:43:59,598 --> 00:44:02,034
They're my people now.

614
00:44:02,067 --> 00:44:04,303
I feel really connected
to them, actually.

615
00:44:05,704 --> 00:44:07,306
They're very misunderstood.

616
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:12,878
I... [exhales]

617
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:18,016
I know there's
something wrong with me.

618
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:19,318
Yeah.

619
00:44:21,053 --> 00:44:22,621
But you're gonna get better.

620
00:44:24,123 --> 00:44:25,491
If I was actually a zombie,

621
00:44:25,524 --> 00:44:28,026
would you tie me up
and keep me in your garage?

622
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:30,596
[scoffs, chuckles]

623
00:44:30,629 --> 00:44:33,599
Yeah, I guess so.

624
00:44:33,632 --> 00:44:36,635
I've been always afraid
of losing you, so, yeah.

625
00:44:38,437 --> 00:44:40,406
Because you knew you would?

626
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:46,278
Adrienne...

627
00:44:47,613 --> 00:44:49,481
doesn't it make sense, right...

628
00:44:51,083 --> 00:44:52,551
that you're alive?

629
00:44:52,584 --> 00:44:56,455
That people can see you?
They talk to you.

630
00:44:57,523 --> 00:44:59,291
You are here.

631
00:44:59,324 --> 00:45:01,059
But I feel soulless.

632
00:45:03,429 --> 00:45:04,997
Hollowed out.

633
00:45:09,568 --> 00:45:13,639
Do you remember when we realized
we were having a baby?

634
00:45:13,672 --> 00:45:15,707
Please don't.

635
00:45:15,742 --> 00:45:20,012
You keep trying to prove that I'm
okay, but I can prove I'm not.

636
00:45:21,113 --> 00:45:22,714
Can I tell you something?

637
00:45:25,651 --> 00:45:28,320
- Yeah.
- I knew I was gonna die.

638
00:45:30,589 --> 00:45:32,157
What do you mean?

639
00:45:33,392 --> 00:45:38,263
She told me, when we went to the
house to look at the broken window.

640
00:45:43,235 --> 00:45:45,103
[chuckles]

641
00:45:45,137 --> 00:45:46,739
I'm gonna check the window.

642
00:45:46,773 --> 00:45:48,407
- Hi.
- [young woman] Hey, welcome.

643
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,509
- Hey! How are you?
- [young woman] Hey!

644
00:45:52,077 --> 00:45:54,580
- What are you guys doing?
- A reading.

645
00:45:54,613 --> 00:45:57,549
- Oh, yeah?
- I'm an assistant to Psychic Elaine.

646
00:45:59,184 --> 00:46:01,520
She's, like, the best in LA,
like, the real, real deal.

647
00:46:01,553 --> 00:46:05,390
Like, not a storefront, like,
otherworldly, and I'm studying under her.

648
00:46:05,424 --> 00:46:06,759
Wow.

649
00:46:06,793 --> 00:46:08,660
You want me
to do a reading on you?

650
00:46:08,694 --> 00:46:12,498
- Sure, why not?
- I can get you later.

651
00:46:12,531 --> 00:46:16,335
Just don't tell me I feel old
because I think that much is obvious.

652
00:46:16,368 --> 00:46:18,604
[chuckles]

653
00:46:18,637 --> 00:46:21,573
Weird,
your lifeline's really short.

654
00:46:21,607 --> 00:46:23,175
What?

655
00:46:23,208 --> 00:46:25,210
I mean, it doesn't
necessarily mean death.

656
00:46:25,244 --> 00:46:27,279
It could be like...
like you're not living,

657
00:46:27,312 --> 00:46:29,081
like you're not living life
to the fullest.

658
00:46:29,114 --> 00:46:32,050
Um... Or I could be
doing it wrong.

659
00:46:32,084 --> 00:46:36,288
No. Yes, it's crazy.
I'm... It's true.

660
00:46:37,155 --> 00:46:38,490
I'm dead.

661
00:46:38,524 --> 00:46:42,561
I die in a car accident,
two weeks after this.

662
00:46:42,594 --> 00:46:46,698
Whoa. That is crazy.

663
00:46:46,733 --> 00:46:49,668
We'll never get to move into this house.
It sucks.

664
00:46:49,701 --> 00:46:52,772
But if you knew,
why did you let yourself get into the car?

665
00:46:53,672 --> 00:46:54,741
Did you want to die?

666
00:46:56,876 --> 00:46:58,343
I don't know. I...

667
00:46:58,377 --> 00:47:01,213
This is grasping
at straws, Adrienne.

668
00:47:01,246 --> 00:47:02,681
It's coincidence.

669
00:47:02,714 --> 00:47:04,683
That's what you said to her,
but then...

670
00:47:04,716 --> 00:47:07,252
How old were you
when your mother died?

671
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:09,454
What...

672
00:47:09,488 --> 00:47:12,424
- Did-Did-Did you tell her?
- No, I swear I didn't.

673
00:47:12,457 --> 00:47:14,226
He was 17.

674
00:47:14,259 --> 00:47:16,161
She's lingering for you.

675
00:47:16,194 --> 00:47:18,463
There's something
unresolved.

676
00:47:18,497 --> 00:47:21,400
She says she wishes
that you spoke at her funeral.

677
00:47:21,433 --> 00:47:23,770
- [scoffs]
- That's it.

678
00:47:23,803 --> 00:47:26,806
[laughs] Uh...

679
00:47:26,839 --> 00:47:30,142
Okay. That's our cue
to go. Sorry.

680
00:47:30,175 --> 00:47:32,845
- You never told me. Was that true?
- Ye... No.

681
00:47:32,879 --> 00:47:35,714
Well, yes. Yes.
Yes, it was true.

682
00:47:35,748 --> 00:47:38,183
I was young.
I didn't know what to say.

683
00:47:38,216 --> 00:47:40,452
I was mad at her,
but that doesn't prove

684
00:47:40,485 --> 00:47:42,354
that she's psychic
or that you're dead.

685
00:47:42,387 --> 00:47:45,792
I kept asking myself again and
again, what is the point of life?

686
00:47:45,825 --> 00:47:49,127
Of us. You kept asking yourself
what's the point of us.

687
00:47:49,161 --> 00:47:53,632
But then when I left Gary and Kevin's
that night, I had a really bad feeling.

688
00:47:53,665 --> 00:47:54,867
[Matteo] Adrienne...

689
00:47:57,603 --> 00:47:59,171
- Hey!
- I had this feeling

690
00:47:59,204 --> 00:48:01,306
like everything
was falling apart.

691
00:48:05,444 --> 00:48:06,846
[Matteo] Adrienne.

692
00:48:09,548 --> 00:48:12,785
- You were pissed at me.
- If we hadn't bought the house,

693
00:48:12,819 --> 00:48:15,153
- none of this would've happened.
- What? It could've been a plane crash.

694
00:48:15,187 --> 00:48:16,488
- It's my fault.
- Stop trying to find meaning

695
00:48:16,521 --> 00:48:18,590
in something meaningless
and random.

696
00:48:18,624 --> 00:48:20,692
You didn't cause
the accident.

697
00:48:20,726 --> 00:48:22,829
If there's someone to blame,
it's me. Yeah.

698
00:48:22,862 --> 00:48:25,865
- I wanted to go out that night, so we did.
- I didn't see the guy coming.

699
00:48:25,898 --> 00:48:29,769
No, no, no. I didn't see the guy coming.
I wanted to stay late.

700
00:48:29,802 --> 00:48:32,905
Hey, stop hijacking this.
Let me finish the story.

701
00:48:32,939 --> 00:48:36,441
I don't want you to finish your story.
I want you to tell the truth.

702
00:48:36,475 --> 00:48:38,176
- You want the truth?
- Yes!

703
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:40,545
Fine.
It wasn't all good.

704
00:48:40,579 --> 00:48:42,882
Do you remember
that work event?

705
00:48:42,915 --> 00:48:46,819
You had just gotten your job
doing grunt work at the museum.

706
00:48:46,853 --> 00:48:48,821
[Adrienne]
Oh, my God. Grunt work?

707
00:48:48,855 --> 00:48:52,190
I'm managing major design installations.
This is not grunt work.

708
00:48:52,224 --> 00:48:53,926
I don't know
why you took it.

709
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,428
Well, aside from the fact
that it's my dream job,

710
00:48:56,461 --> 00:48:58,330
some people actually have
to work for a living,

711
00:48:58,363 --> 00:49:01,500
so that they can support their
family, so they can buy a house.

712
00:49:01,533 --> 00:49:02,701
- Okay, yeah?
- Thank you.

713
00:49:02,735 --> 00:49:04,636
Have piles of shit, right?
Thank you.

714
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:06,638
You don't want things?
You don't want tools and tech toys

715
00:49:06,672 --> 00:49:08,941
and whatever other shit it is you
get shipped direct to your garage?

716
00:49:08,975 --> 00:49:11,376
Okay, I'm just saying that
if we stay in the apartment,

717
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:16,448
we have a low rent, we keep some freedom,
and we're not tied to a mortgage.

718
00:49:16,481 --> 00:49:19,317
If you're never tied to anything,
then you'll never be free.

719
00:49:20,019 --> 00:49:21,754
What musical is that from?

720
00:49:22,654 --> 00:49:24,857
- It's from <i>Pippin.</i> It doesn't...
- [laughs]

721
00:49:24,891 --> 00:49:27,225
Doesn't mean that
it's not true.

722
00:49:27,259 --> 00:49:29,394
What about this beautiful
adventure we're on?

723
00:49:29,428 --> 00:49:32,631
You're going to be working
from 9:00 to 9:00 every day.

724
00:49:32,664 --> 00:49:38,236
Gonna be laden with kids, the
house, with no time to go anywhere.

725
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:41,941
Not everyone can not finish
school and not get a real job...

726
00:49:41,974 --> 00:49:43,408
- I have a real job.
- ...and not care.

727
00:49:43,442 --> 00:49:45,945
- I have a real job.
- This is what I want.

728
00:49:45,978 --> 00:49:49,882
If you don't want it too,
you should just... get out of my way.

729
00:49:56,555 --> 00:49:57,589
See?

730
00:49:59,491 --> 00:50:00,960
Where do you go?

731
00:50:06,331 --> 00:50:09,534
- [Liam] Adrienne.
- Hey! How are you?

732
00:50:09,568 --> 00:50:11,269
I'm good. Champagne?

733
00:50:11,303 --> 00:50:12,905
Mind reader. Thank you.

734
00:50:14,573 --> 00:50:17,275
[Matteo]
The look in your eyes. So alive.

735
00:50:17,309 --> 00:50:19,411
He is a work colleague,
and he's on the board.

736
00:50:19,444 --> 00:50:21,781
- I am supposed to be nice to him.
- Thank you.

737
00:50:21,814 --> 00:50:24,616
- For what?
- For making this event worth attending.

738
00:50:24,649 --> 00:50:29,621
I'm... Yeah. Frida Kahlo and Maya
Deren in one space? Be still, my heart.

739
00:50:29,654 --> 00:50:33,760
[chuckles] Yeah. I know I should be
focused on the art, but I just can't.

740
00:50:33,793 --> 00:50:35,962
- Why?
- You're distracting me.

741
00:50:35,995 --> 00:50:38,865
I just... I threw on...

742
00:50:38,898 --> 00:50:41,533
like, frazzled, like,
whatever work thing.

743
00:50:42,935 --> 00:50:44,971
Don't underestimate
yourself.

744
00:50:51,878 --> 00:50:56,348
Okay, fine. Fine. You saw that.
So what? So what?

745
00:50:57,716 --> 00:51:00,019
I'm sorry. Matteo is trying
to prove that I'm alive

746
00:51:00,052 --> 00:51:04,623
by making me feel,
what, like, guilty? Thanks.

747
00:51:04,656 --> 00:51:06,893
He invited me
to check out his woodworking.

748
00:51:07,927 --> 00:51:10,462
- The same night?
- Yeah, I think so.

749
00:51:10,963 --> 00:51:12,564
I bought a bench.

750
00:51:25,544 --> 00:51:27,046
- [Matteo laughs]
- [Liam] Oh!

751
00:51:27,079 --> 00:51:29,916
- Here it comes.
- Such terror.

752
00:51:29,949 --> 00:51:31,716
You told me it was
referred by a friend.

753
00:51:31,751 --> 00:51:33,451
[Liam] How did you kill me
that fast?

754
00:51:33,485 --> 00:51:35,487
I didn't even know
you guys knew each other.

755
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,956
Hmm. So you lied.

756
00:51:36,989 --> 00:51:40,625
Now you know the truth.
Feel better?

757
00:51:40,659 --> 00:51:43,095
I'm just saying,
most guys would punch a guy

758
00:51:43,129 --> 00:51:44,997
who was making moves
on their girlfriend.

759
00:51:45,031 --> 00:51:48,600
[chuckles] Okay.
You wanted me to punch him?

760
00:51:48,633 --> 00:51:51,103
He's got six inches on me.
No way.

761
00:51:51,137 --> 00:51:52,872
Why didn't you just tell me
you were jealous?

762
00:51:52,905 --> 00:51:55,407
I didn't think
I could do anything about it.

763
00:51:56,575 --> 00:51:59,812
I mean, probably delay it.
Did I?

764
00:52:00,378 --> 00:52:02,581
I didn't cheat on you.

765
00:52:03,381 --> 00:52:05,650
- Did you want to?
- It doesn't matter.

766
00:52:05,684 --> 00:52:07,987
It matters.
It fucking matters.

767
00:52:15,862 --> 00:52:17,730
[Ellie crying]

768
00:52:17,763 --> 00:52:19,765
Bullshit! Bullshit!
That... That never happened.

769
00:52:19,799 --> 00:52:22,802
Okay. Look me in the eye
and tell me I am making this up.

770
00:52:22,835 --> 00:52:24,837
You live so in your head.
You exaggerate things.

771
00:52:24,871 --> 00:52:26,504
- You conflate things.
- Stop lying to me.

772
00:52:26,538 --> 00:52:29,742
Stop ignoring...
Stop disappearing on me.

773
00:52:29,775 --> 00:52:31,409
On our baby.

774
00:52:31,443 --> 00:52:34,146
Even me dying isn't enough
to get you to step up.

775
00:52:36,514 --> 00:52:38,516
It's so unfair you expect me
to fail.

776
00:52:39,451 --> 00:52:41,988
You can't pretend to know
what's going to happen,

777
00:52:42,021 --> 00:52:44,156
how I would feel
if I lost you.

778
00:52:45,057 --> 00:52:47,626
What fucking living hell
that would be for me.

779
00:52:50,462 --> 00:52:53,465
Maybe I would never recover.

780
00:52:54,166 --> 00:52:55,868
Maybe I would be no good
for Ellie.

781
00:52:57,502 --> 00:52:59,138
Maybe I would break
if I lost you.

782
00:53:01,207 --> 00:53:02,707
[doorbell rings]

783
00:53:04,777 --> 00:53:06,178
Who is that?

784
00:53:06,611 --> 00:53:07,914
I'm gonna check.

785
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:13,119
[priest] Hi, Steve.
How you holding up?

786
00:53:13,819 --> 00:53:15,988
[Patty]
Hello, Father Richard.

787
00:53:16,022 --> 00:53:18,090
Proof that I'm dead.

788
00:53:18,124 --> 00:53:22,094
[Matteo] Your mother calls Father
Richard if the milk is past its due date.

789
00:53:22,128 --> 00:53:25,563
Adrienne, I'm planning a
bingo night at the church.

790
00:53:26,799 --> 00:53:28,100
What are you doing?

791
00:53:28,134 --> 00:53:30,770
I'm trying...
I'm trying to work out

792
00:53:30,803 --> 00:53:32,604
- what to be buried in.
- What?

793
00:53:32,637 --> 00:53:34,740
This one actually
doesn't zip up at the back,

794
00:53:34,774 --> 00:53:37,109
but if you leave it unzipped,
I don't think anybody's gonna notice.

795
00:53:37,143 --> 00:53:38,844
- Slow down.
- Actually,

796
00:53:38,878 --> 00:53:41,546
I think I would rather be
scattered somewhere beautiful.

797
00:53:41,579 --> 00:53:43,581
Oh, okay.

798
00:53:43,615 --> 00:53:46,152
You have a second chance, Matteo,
and you've just got to move on.

799
00:53:46,185 --> 00:53:49,521
- [scoffs]
- And you gotta find somebody that you love.

800
00:53:49,554 --> 00:53:51,023
Not Shea.
Please don't marry Shea.

801
00:53:51,057 --> 00:53:52,624
[chuckles]

802
00:53:52,657 --> 00:53:55,962
Somebody... Somebody educated
and somebody funny.

803
00:53:57,096 --> 00:54:00,900
Find somebody funny
and just love them.

804
00:54:00,933 --> 00:54:02,835
- And let them love you.
- It's gonna be weird

805
00:54:02,868 --> 00:54:05,738
to bring a girl with my dead
girlfriend still in my bed, right?

806
00:54:05,771 --> 00:54:10,743
And I want my funeral to be fun.
Not in a church, please.

807
00:54:10,776 --> 00:54:12,144
- Okay.
- No matter what my mother says.

808
00:54:12,178 --> 00:54:15,247
We'll have a dance-pop
party funeral.

809
00:54:15,281 --> 00:54:16,983
You're the one
who likes pop music.

810
00:54:17,016 --> 00:54:19,517
I don't like pop music.
I want Missy Elliott.

811
00:54:19,551 --> 00:54:23,688
Okay, we'll have a bunch of
geriatrics dancing to Missy Elliott.

812
00:54:23,722 --> 00:54:26,624
Man, life.

813
00:54:26,658 --> 00:54:29,627
- Perfect.
- What a tricky little minx.

814
00:54:32,732 --> 00:54:34,233
Hey, stop. Stop!

815
00:54:34,266 --> 00:54:35,901
Stop!

816
00:54:35,935 --> 00:54:38,670
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.

817
00:54:38,703 --> 00:54:40,139
What the fuck are you doing?

818
00:54:43,042 --> 00:54:45,211
You don't get
to be dead yet, okay?

819
00:54:46,678 --> 00:54:49,248
Fuck. So impatient.

820
00:54:58,656 --> 00:54:59,992
Adrienne.

821
00:55:03,262 --> 00:55:04,696
Hey.

822
00:55:09,701 --> 00:55:12,772
Look at me.
So impatient.

823
00:55:14,106 --> 00:55:15,741
Shh, shh.

824
00:55:15,775 --> 00:55:18,911
Even having kids.
You remember it? Last year.

825
00:55:19,879 --> 00:55:21,613
<i>Día de Muertos.</i>

826
00:55:25,751 --> 00:55:27,119
Stay with me.

827
00:55:27,853 --> 00:55:29,621
I know you remember.

828
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:38,898
[chattering]

829
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,835
- [man 1] Yeah.
- [man 2] Okay.

830
00:55:42,868 --> 00:55:44,904
- I'd be down.
- [man 1] Can we get two of those, please?

831
00:55:44,937 --> 00:55:48,007
Okay, I gotta say this quick.
Uh, A wants a baby.

832
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,176
- What?
- Here is a cute...

833
00:55:50,209 --> 00:55:52,978
She's gonna break up with you if
you don't pull the goalie right now.

834
00:55:53,012 --> 00:55:55,881
What the...
We just started talking about this.

835
00:55:57,149 --> 00:55:58,851
He shouldn't
have told you that.

836
00:55:58,884 --> 00:56:01,020
She said she was going to
poke a hole in her diaphragm.

837
00:56:01,053 --> 00:56:02,788
I was kidding.

838
00:56:02,822 --> 00:56:04,390
I was kidding,
obviously.

839
00:56:04,423 --> 00:56:06,058
Okay, it didn't sound like
you were kidding.

840
00:56:06,092 --> 00:56:07,993
- Maggie.
- I'm just being honest.

841
00:56:08,027 --> 00:56:10,796
Okay, she was upset,
and I talked her down.

842
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:12,398
So impatient.

843
00:56:12,431 --> 00:56:15,801
I'm just asking you to be
patient with me, with us.

844
00:56:17,303 --> 00:56:20,206
- May I finish the story?
- Okay, sure.

845
00:56:20,239 --> 00:56:23,175
I remember what else
happened that day.

846
00:56:23,209 --> 00:56:25,911
Fucking Matteo!

847
00:56:25,945 --> 00:56:29,014
Hi! You said
you were out of town.

848
00:56:29,048 --> 00:56:30,749
- Uh...
- [chuckles]

849
00:56:30,783 --> 00:56:33,185
No. No. Um...
[chuckles]

850
00:56:33,219 --> 00:56:35,354
- The-The trip got canceled.
- Oh...

851
00:56:35,387 --> 00:56:37,957
It's so funny that Shea would know
about a trip of yours that got canceled,

852
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:41,626
- 'cause you guys don't talk.
- This is not why I brought this memory up.

853
00:56:42,128 --> 00:56:43,729
- Hey!
- Shea.

854
00:56:43,762 --> 00:56:47,199
- Hi! Wow, you look so great.
- Hi. So do you, always.

855
00:56:47,233 --> 00:56:48,934
- How are you guys?
- [Adrienne] Great.

856
00:56:48,968 --> 00:56:50,736
- Yeah? Are you married yet?
- [Matteo] Uh-huh.

857
00:56:50,769 --> 00:56:52,238
Oh, God, no.

858
00:56:52,271 --> 00:56:55,207
No, I cannot bear the idea
of letting this oaf own me,

859
00:56:55,241 --> 00:56:59,677
but it's so great that you guys still
talk, that you kept in touch.

860
00:56:59,711 --> 00:57:03,015
Even though you swore to me that you
didn't talk to her anymore. Liar.

861
00:57:03,048 --> 00:57:06,185
Of course. I'm sorry we haven't talked.
That's so...

862
00:57:06,218 --> 00:57:09,188
- That's stupid. It's so stupid.
- No, totally. Right, right.

863
00:57:09,221 --> 00:57:10,856
We should have lunch. Lie.

864
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:12,091
- Totally.
- Lie.

865
00:57:13,159 --> 00:57:15,027
Hey, are you still,
um, woodworking?

866
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:16,762
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Oh.

867
00:57:16,795 --> 00:57:19,131
Amazing, because my dad
just bought this huge property.

868
00:57:19,165 --> 00:57:21,767
So I actually, um...
I might have a job for you.

869
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:22,868
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

870
00:57:22,902 --> 00:57:24,702
- That's so sweet.
- Yeah.

871
00:57:24,737 --> 00:57:27,039
This was the beginning
of the end, wasn't it?

872
00:57:27,072 --> 00:57:29,175
- What? No, no, no, no.
- Cool, so, um...

873
00:57:29,208 --> 00:57:31,177
[speaking Spanish]

874
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:33,379
It was so good
to see you, girl.

875
00:57:33,412 --> 00:57:35,147
- [chuckles]
- [chuckles]

876
00:57:35,181 --> 00:57:36,815
Hey. Bye.

877
00:57:37,783 --> 00:57:39,084
I love you.

878
00:57:39,118 --> 00:57:41,320
[scoffs] What?

879
00:57:41,353 --> 00:57:43,721
[chuckles]

880
00:57:43,756 --> 00:57:46,158
Why don't you just be
with Shea, Matteo?

881
00:57:46,192 --> 00:57:48,794
Are you crazy?
If I wanted to be with her, I would be.

882
00:57:48,827 --> 00:57:51,263
- Is that a threat?
- No, I'm just saying, I'm with you.

883
00:57:54,533 --> 00:57:57,002
God, I was so much, wasn't I?

884
00:57:57,603 --> 00:58:00,005
No. We made up, didn't we?

885
00:58:00,839 --> 00:58:02,208
- Did we?
- Yeah.

886
00:58:03,175 --> 00:58:04,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah. This...

887
00:58:04,843 --> 00:58:07,479
This wasn't the beginning
of the end.

888
00:58:07,513 --> 00:58:09,748
This was the moment when we...

889
00:58:10,849 --> 00:58:12,017
when I told you...

890
00:58:14,119 --> 00:58:15,321
Hey.

891
00:58:15,354 --> 00:58:18,057
I wanna have babies
with you, okay?

892
00:58:19,191 --> 00:58:20,226
I wanna have a kid.

893
00:58:22,027 --> 00:58:23,329
Let's have a baby.

894
00:58:25,264 --> 00:58:28,400
You only agreed because I threatened
to leave you if you didn't.

895
00:58:28,434 --> 00:58:32,171
Okay, yeah,
but I still agreed. Right?

896
00:58:34,073 --> 00:58:35,407
Because I wanted to.

897
00:58:36,308 --> 00:58:39,111
You're right. Let's do it.

898
00:58:42,248 --> 00:58:43,816
No, what's wrong?

899
00:58:45,217 --> 00:58:46,952
I'm so glad you said yes.

900
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,089
And I'm so glad
we had Ellie.

901
00:59:07,406 --> 00:59:10,142
Hey, what's wrong?
I said yes, right?

902
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,788
Hey.

903
00:59:25,924 --> 00:59:27,426
- Adrienne.
- He's here.

904
00:59:28,093 --> 00:59:29,428
Who's here?

905
00:59:30,863 --> 00:59:32,164
Adrienne.

906
00:59:45,644 --> 00:59:46,945
Hey.

907
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:49,948
Adrienne, talk to me.

908
01:00:00,359 --> 01:00:02,928
Adrienne, wake up. Hey!

909
01:00:03,495 --> 01:00:04,830
Hey, wake up.

910
01:00:05,331 --> 01:00:06,498
Adrienne.

911
01:00:09,435 --> 01:00:12,271
Adrienne, wake up.
Adrienne, wake up.

912
01:00:13,072 --> 01:00:14,273
Wake up!

913
01:00:16,508 --> 01:00:19,578
Fuck. Don't do that
to me, please.

914
01:00:23,916 --> 01:00:25,384
I don't know
how to help you.

915
01:00:26,985 --> 01:00:28,420
This is bigger than me.

916
01:00:31,457 --> 01:00:32,558
You saw it.

917
01:00:34,927 --> 01:00:36,628
No, I didn't see anything.

918
01:00:42,434 --> 01:00:44,370
Let's get you out
of this thing.

919
01:01:08,994 --> 01:01:10,129
I give up.

920
01:01:12,097 --> 01:01:14,099
I can't do this anymore.

921
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:39,558
Wait.

922
01:01:57,744 --> 01:01:59,645
Okay.

923
01:01:59,678 --> 01:02:03,515
I guess
I'll go avoid your mom.

924

Hey.

929
01:04:03,435 --> 01:04:05,137
[groans] Go away.

930
01:04:06,238 --> 01:04:07,339
I can't.

931
01:04:08,775 --> 01:04:10,676
You can't help me.

932
01:04:10,709 --> 01:04:12,210
What if you're wrong?

933
01:04:16,883 --> 01:04:19,117
Adrienne.

934
01:04:19,151 --> 01:04:22,454
You want this to be the truth Ellie
has to live with her whole life?

935
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:30,596
Don't talk to me about truth.

936
01:04:37,669 --> 01:04:39,338
You were right about Shea.

937
01:04:46,612 --> 01:04:48,113
What you saw.

938
01:04:54,186 --> 01:04:57,189
[Ellie crying]

939
01:04:58,891 --> 01:05:01,727
Look, it's a job,
a well-paid job.

940
01:05:01,761 --> 01:05:04,262
- We can't afford to both take time off.
- [mumbles]

941
01:05:04,296 --> 01:05:06,531
No, you look, Matteo.

942
01:05:06,565 --> 01:05:10,502
You brought this baby
into the world, a bastard.

943
01:05:10,535 --> 01:05:13,305
- Mom.
- Well, she is. You did that.

944
01:05:13,338 --> 01:05:14,539
It's the truth.

945
01:05:14,573 --> 01:05:17,209
And now you turn your back
on her?

946
01:05:17,242 --> 01:05:19,746
Look, Patty,
go fuck yourself. Okay?

947
01:05:19,779 --> 01:05:21,346
- Matteo!
- What?

948
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:23,850
- You're gonna defend her crap?
- Mom. Mom.

949
01:05:23,883 --> 01:05:26,251
- Please...
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Adrienne.

950
01:05:26,284 --> 01:05:27,754
I can't be around this.

951
01:05:28,654 --> 01:05:30,622
Thank fucking God!

952
01:05:30,656 --> 01:05:32,691
Are you kidding me?

953
01:05:32,724 --> 01:05:36,395
That was the only help I had,
the only person I had.

954
01:05:36,428 --> 01:05:37,964
Please,
stop being dramatic, okay?

955
01:05:37,997 --> 01:05:39,297
Me?

956
01:05:40,565 --> 01:05:44,636
You're the one who left.
You're the one who couldn't handle it.

957
01:06:05,424 --> 01:06:08,493
And I stood there forever
just hoping you would come back.

958
01:06:17,569 --> 01:06:19,839
Slow down, or you're going
to get in an accident.

959
01:06:19,872 --> 01:06:23,743
I didn't.
I just needed an escape.

960
01:06:27,847 --> 01:06:30,750
I was afraid of being
like my stepfather.

961
01:06:31,683 --> 01:06:33,853
Of family, of all of it.

962
01:06:33,886 --> 01:06:36,621
All my life trying
to avoid becoming that man,

963
01:06:36,655 --> 01:06:39,357
and here I am,
just turning into him.

964
01:06:39,391 --> 01:06:41,727
You're not him.
You're nothing like him.

965
01:06:41,761 --> 01:06:44,964
And when I got back to you,
I swear, nothing happened

966
01:06:44,997 --> 01:06:46,899
because I was afraid
you would...

967
01:06:48,366 --> 01:06:51,369
I was afraid
I would lose you if I told you.

968
01:06:56,408 --> 01:06:57,709
Tell me now.

969
01:07:01,748 --> 01:07:06,786

[romantic pop music playing]

973
01:07:34,613 --> 01:07:36,615
And then...

974
01:07:36,648 --> 01:07:37,817
[Adrienne]
And then what?

975
01:07:39,551 --> 01:07:40,753
And then, I stopped.

976
01:07:42,789 --> 01:07:45,724
Because I felt like
you were there.

977
01:07:46,291 --> 01:07:47,994
Like you were right there.

978
01:07:49,494 --> 01:07:51,731
And I couldn't be anything
but yours.

979
01:07:54,066 --> 01:07:55,835
It was never clearer to me.

980
01:07:57,536 --> 01:08:02,574
I was just so ashamed of lying
and of failing.

981
01:08:07,079 --> 01:08:10,917
I should have been honest
about feeling overwhelmed.

982
01:08:11,683 --> 01:08:12,885
I should have stayed.

983
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:19,691
I should have stood up for you
with my mom. I just...

984
01:08:20,893 --> 01:08:22,561
No wonder you left.

985
01:08:22,594 --> 01:08:26,398
- I just made it so hard for you to love me.
- No.

986
01:08:26,431 --> 01:08:30,036
I was always tearing it down
and pulling you apart.

987
01:08:30,069 --> 01:08:31,103
No.

988
01:08:31,938 --> 01:08:33,105
Liar.

989
01:08:37,977 --> 01:08:39,812
We just had so little time.

01:09:02,567 --> 01:09:04,103
I should have loved you better.

993
01:09:06,005 --> 01:09:07,405
We still have time.

994
01:09:10,442 --> 01:09:12,778
We just got to hold on to it.

995
01:09:14,679 --> 01:09:16,615
Even if it gets messy
and hard.

996
01:09:19,085 --> 01:09:20,887
Take the good and the bad.

997
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:22,788
For better or worse.

998
01:09:25,657 --> 01:09:26,893
Give me your hand.

999
01:09:29,195 --> 01:09:30,595
Give me your hand.

1000
01:09:31,931 --> 01:09:32,965
Please.

1001
01:10:12,537 --> 01:10:14,740
Do you remember the day
we got married?

1002
01:10:16,842 --> 01:10:17,877
What?

1003
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:22,214
Marry me.

1004
01:10:24,817 --> 01:10:26,484
It's too late.

1005
01:10:26,518 --> 01:10:28,553
No. No, no, no.

1006
01:10:29,521 --> 01:10:30,957
Just say yes.

1007
01:10:36,528 --> 01:10:37,629
Marry me.

1008
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,101
Yes.

1009
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:04,857

you are my best friend.</i>

1010

you are my calm and my truth.</i>

[Matteo]

<i>You know I don't believe
in soul mates, but...</i>

1015
01:11:19,171 --> 01:11:21,874
I married you
the minute I met you.

1016
01:11:21,907 --> 01:11:27,013
And loving you is the closest
thing to faith I've ever known.

1017
01:11:27,046 --> 01:11:31,017
I promise to love you
and let you love me.

1018
01:11:33,853 --> 01:11:37,023
I promise to always be the
person who earns your love.

1019
01:11:40,725 --> 01:11:41,894
I... that one.

[laughing]

1021
01:11:44,797 --> 01:11:46,698
I give you my hand.

1022
01:11:46,732 --> 01:11:49,001
I give you my hand.

1023
01:11:50,136 --> 01:11:52,071
And I give you my heart.

1024
01:11:52,104 --> 01:11:53,806
I give you my heart.

1025
01:11:55,707 --> 01:11:57,176
From this day forward...

1026

From this day forward
for the rest of our lives.

1027

For the rest of our lives.

1028
01:12:03,382 --> 01:12:07,086
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

Will wonders never cease?

1034
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:43,655
[Matteo] Look.
Even the she-beast is happy.

1035
01:12:44,356 --> 01:12:46,591
Now I know it's a dream.
[chuckles]

1036
01:12:54,934 --> 01:12:57,669
- You know how I feel?
- Hmm?

1037
01:12:59,071 --> 01:13:00,106
Alive.

1038
01:13:00,139 --> 01:13:01,974
- Really?
- Yeah.

Oh, say it again.
Say it again.

1041
01:13:05,778 --> 01:13:07,346
I feel alive.

1042
01:13:10,182 --> 01:13:12,084
You are alive, so alive.

1043
01:13:12,118 --> 01:13:14,220
It makes sense.
My ribs are killing me.

1044
01:13:14,253 --> 01:13:16,322
- [laughs] I'm sorry.
- Stop pressing on them.

- I'm sorry.
- [laughing]

1046

- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Ow.

01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:22,828
Thank God for seat belts.

I'm so happy you were right.

1049
01:13:29,235 --> 01:13:31,871
- Can you say that again?
- What?

- The-The part where I'm right.
- Oh. [laughs]

Me too.

1055
01:14:01,934 --> 01:14:03,002
Hello, baby.

1056
01:14:03,836 --> 01:14:05,938
You're so strong.

1057
01:14:05,971 --> 01:14:08,807
- You're so strong.
- [Patty] You gave us quite a scare, you know.

- I'm feeling better now.
- Well, you're a strong girl too.

You know,
Matteo really helped me.

1060
01:14:14,180 --> 01:14:17,316
I know he doesn't share your beliefs,
but he's a pretty extraordinary person.

1061
01:14:17,349 --> 01:14:19,717
- I don't want to speak...
- Can we not do this right now?

1062
01:14:19,752 --> 01:14:22,021
I'm just saying that there is no reason
why he couldn't take care of Ellie

1063
01:14:22,054 --> 01:14:23,789
on his own if he needed to.

1064
01:14:23,822 --> 01:14:25,723
- You don't have to attack me.
- I'm not attacking you.

1065
01:14:25,758 --> 01:14:27,159
- Adrienne.
- [Patty] Maggie.

1066

- Maggie.
- Needs to get changed anyhow.

1067
01:14:29,161 --> 01:14:31,197
- Come on, baby.
- Hi.

1068

Oh, my gosh.

1069
01:14:32,765 --> 01:14:34,166
Think you're still in shock?

1070
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:36,135
You know,
I actually thought I was dead.

1071
01:14:36,168 --> 01:14:38,470
- Oh, honey. I'm so sorry.
- Dead.

1072
01:14:38,504 --> 01:14:40,005
I just feel really raw.

1073
01:14:40,039 --> 01:14:42,174
Yeah, that's totally normal.

1074
01:14:42,208 --> 01:14:46,212
You know what? I'm here for you, okay?
Whatever you need.

1075
01:14:46,245 --> 01:14:50,482
Right now, we have to get you dressed
because you have a doctor's appointment.

1076
01:14:50,516 --> 01:14:52,284
Okay, Mom.

and I'll call you back.</i>

Hey, where'd you go?
We should be home by...

1079
01:15:02,228 --> 01:15:05,264
Sorry. Home by 2:00. Call me.

1080
01:15:09,969 --> 01:15:11,370
How are you feeling?

1081
01:15:12,805 --> 01:15:15,040
Like I don't want
to be in a car.

1082
01:15:15,074 --> 01:15:18,277
[Patty] I heard you talking
with Maggie, and I just...

1083
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:21,180
I'm glad that you have her
to process with.

1084
01:15:22,181 --> 01:15:23,916
Yeah, she's amazing.

1085
01:15:27,119 --> 01:15:28,754
I'm not good at these things.

1086
01:15:30,122 --> 01:15:31,991
That's okay. That's okay.

1087
01:15:32,024 --> 01:15:33,959
[Patty]
I haven't known what to say.

1088
01:15:33,993 --> 01:15:36,395
I've been trying to find the
words, but I...

1089
01:15:38,197 --> 01:15:40,799
I cook and I clean,
and that's what I can do.

1090
01:15:41,367 --> 01:15:43,802
It's okay, Mom. I'm okay.

1091
01:15:45,971 --> 01:15:48,807
Got to take the good with the bad, right?
That's life.

1092
01:15:52,211 --> 01:15:53,912
For better or worse.

1093
01:15:57,016 --> 01:16:00,152
[Patty]
I am just... I'm just so sorry.

1094
01:16:03,856 --> 01:16:06,959
As a parent, all you want to do
is protect your children.

1095
01:16:09,628 --> 01:16:13,265
[breathing heavily]

[fluid dripping]

1097
01:16:17,970 --> 01:16:19,938
