00:05:12,486 --> 00:05:15,576
Yeah, there'’s this co-op

[Matteo] We showed upfor inspection with our baby.

58
00:05:31,243 --> 00:05:34,116
She was, what, like,
seven days old.

59
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:36,901
Yeah. So little--[Matteo chuckles]
We scared them shitless.

Married people with babies.
Run!

61
00:05:38,903 --> 00:05:40,818
We'’re not married. No.

62
00:05:40,862 --> 00:05:43,517
[man 1] I'’m sorry.I didn'’t mean to assume.

63
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,389
No, we just--We'’ve got the houseand the baby, and so...

64
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:49,740
Also, like, a new marriage,whatever, it'’s like...

65

[man 2] Totally.We wouldn'’t havedone it, honestly,

66
00:05:51,612 --> 00:05:53,440
except my family
would'’ve killed me.

67
00:05:53,483 --> 00:05:55,790
No, you mean me. They would'’vecut my dick off with a machete.

68
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,226
Oh. [chuckles] Ow!

69
00:05:57,269 --> 00:05:59,271
And I thought
Adrienne'’s mom hated me.

70
00:05:59,315 --> 00:06:02,057
I mean, she does,
but more in a

71
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,755
"I'’m praying to God
to curse your eternal soul"
kind of way.

72
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,410
When she comes
to the house,
we play this game

73
00:06:07,454 --> 00:06:09,673
where we pretend
we can'’t see
or hear each other.

74
00:06:09,717 --> 00:06:11,196
Very pleasant.

75
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,198

81
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:40,400
I had no idea thathe was going to be there, okay?

82
00:06:40,443 --> 00:06:44,360
And God forbid I have friends.You certainly have friends,right?

83
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:56,764
You know,
we both deserve to be happy.

84

get through it.
I want to enjoy it.

[scoffs] Don'’t.You can'’t do it.

97
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:30,754
No, you want me to make upsome pretend confession

00:07:30,798 --> 00:07:33,148
to justify your paranoia,and I won'’t do that.

99
00:07:34,105 --> 00:07:35,933
Yeah, right.

Ellie Bellie, you'’re gonna livewith Grandma and Grandpa now.

175
00:14:02,363 --> 00:14:07,281
[sings lullaby]

176
00:14:16,638 --> 00:14:18,074
Look at you.

177
00:14:21,469 --> 00:14:23,036
Grandma?Hmm?

178
00:14:25,255 --> 00:14:27,605
Do you really thinkshe loved my dad?

179
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:30,739
Are those my journals?
Oh, God, no. Fuck. Don'’t--
Please don'’t look at those.

180
00:14:30,782 --> 00:14:35,091
[Adrienne'’s mom]I think your dadwas hard to love.

181
00:14:35,135 --> 00:14:36,484
[sobbing]

182
00:14:36,527 --> 00:14:37,877
Stop now.

183
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,315
It'’s not your faultyour father left.

184
00:14:41,358 --> 00:14:46,102
Now, tears won'’t solve anything.They won'’t bring him back.

185
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:49,671
Bring him back
from where?

186
00:14:49,714 --> 00:14:52,717
Where is your dad?
Where the shit is your dad?

187
00:14:54,415 --> 00:14:56,460
[echoing] Matteo?

188
00:15:48,599 --> 00:15:51,167
[Matteo]
Hey! Adrienne!

189
00:15:51,211 --> 00:15:53,691
Come down.
What are you doing?

190
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,564
You can see me.

191
00:15:56,607 --> 00:15:58,261
What?

192
00:15:59,697 --> 00:16:01,743
I died.

193
00:16:01,786 --> 00:16:04,789
-I died, Matteo.
-Okay.

194
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:08,793
It'’s so wrong that that was it.It was just headlightsand a half gasp--

195
00:16:08,837 --> 00:16:09,969
Stop. Stop.

196
00:16:11,057 --> 00:16:14,408
You'’re confused.
We had an accident.

197
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:17,237
Oh, my God,
you'’re dead too.

198
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,629
What? No!

199
00:16:18,673 --> 00:16:20,675
No, I'’m not.

200
00:16:21,328 --> 00:16:22,633
And you'’re not.

201
00:16:23,286 --> 00:16:24,679
How do you know?

202
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,943
Because I know.

203
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,728
Well, because we'’re here.

204
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:35,995
I mean, spending eternity
on the 10 Freeway--

205
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:37,561
What did we do
to deserve that?

206
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:43,350
You weren'’t there with Ellie.

207
00:16:43,393 --> 00:16:45,656
Where do you go?

208
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:49,660
What happens to you?You just get scared and then,what, you just-- you disappear?

209
00:16:50,487 --> 00:16:52,272
You concussed. That'’s it.

210
00:16:53,273 --> 00:16:55,623
No. I'’m dead.

211
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,886
I could step into traffic now.It wouldn'’t matter.Hey!

212
00:16:57,929 --> 00:16:58,887
[tires screech]

213
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:00,541
Hey.

214
00:17:02,325 --> 00:17:04,023
It'’s okay.

215
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:07,461
What is this, like, purgatory?What'’s happening to me?

216
00:17:07,504 --> 00:17:09,158
Just hold on to me. Hmm?

217
00:17:18,124 --> 00:17:21,866
[Ellie babbling]

218
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:25,174
[Ellie crying]

219
00:17:25,218 --> 00:17:27,568
[Adrienne'’s mom] We just wantwhat'’s best for Ellie.

220
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:29,961
We can'’t leave her here, Steve.

221
00:17:30,005 --> 00:17:33,139
[Steve] If she had
just left instructions

222
00:17:33,182 --> 00:17:36,055
for what she would'’ve wanted
in a situation like this.

223
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:38,231
[Adrienne'’s mom]She would want usto take care of Ellie.

224
00:17:38,274 --> 00:17:39,319
What about Matteo?

225
00:17:40,711 --> 00:17:43,497
God forgive me,
but this is all his fault.

226
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,021
He couldn'’t take care of her.He wouldn'’t marry her.

227
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,936
He couldn'’t protect her,
and now she'’s--

228
00:17:47,979 --> 00:17:50,112
[Steve] I don'’t think
we should get ahead
of ourselves.

229
00:17:50,156 --> 00:17:52,114
[Adrienne'’s mom]We should take the baby home.

230
00:18:27,976 --> 00:18:29,847
[pounding]

231
00:18:30,674 --> 00:18:32,894
[screams, panting]Shit!

232
00:18:32,937 --> 00:18:34,678
What? What happened?

233
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:40,467
There was somebody outside.I thought I saw some...

234
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:44,471
Outside? It was me.
I was outside.

235
00:18:44,514 --> 00:18:47,169
The door was locked.I had to go around the house.

236
00:18:52,043 --> 00:18:53,654
Hey.

237
00:18:53,697 --> 00:18:56,352
I don'’t know how much timeI have left here, Matteo.

238
00:18:57,223 --> 00:18:58,920
Well, none of us do, right?

239
00:18:58,963 --> 00:19:00,487
It'’s part of the mystery.

240
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,706
I heard them talking.They'’re gonna take Ellie.

241
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,794
Who said--My mother.

242
00:19:03,838 --> 00:19:05,883
I just heard them.[scoffs]

243
00:19:08,103 --> 00:19:10,975
I'’m perfectly capable
of taking care of my family,
Patty.

244
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:13,326
Thank you very much.
[scoffs]

245
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:14,718
As if it was my fault.

246
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,766
Hey. We got
to get you better, okay?

247
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:22,552
But no one
is taking our baby.
Okay?

248
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:26,513
Hey. Come.

249
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,602
Come, come.

250
00:19:30,473 --> 00:19:34,738
It will take a pack of wolvesmore rabid than your motherto take her away. All right?

251
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,091
Do we even have a baby?

252
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:42,833
What?The baby was in the car,

253
00:19:42,877 --> 00:19:45,009
but the car seat was emp--

254
00:19:45,053 --> 00:19:47,577
Hey. You--Maybe I just imaginedthat we have a baby.

255
00:19:47,621 --> 00:19:51,102
You-- You didn'’t wantto have a baby.

256
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:56,282
We have a baby.
Ellie is our baby.

257
00:19:56,325 --> 00:19:59,894
She'’s six months old,
kinda cute.

258
00:20:01,156 --> 00:20:04,464
Remember when she was born,
that she couldn'’t latch?

259
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,640
We were freaking out.

260
00:20:08,381 --> 00:20:11,471
And then these researchers
from Denmark came.

261
00:20:11,514 --> 00:20:13,255
Remember what he said?

262
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:18,260
"We'’re doing a study
on the benefits of..."
Of what?

263
00:20:18,304 --> 00:20:21,916
Of narrative therapyfor new mothers and newborns.

264
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:24,397
You'’ve been through
a traumatic experience,

265
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,313
but you'’ve been able to processby talking through it.

266
00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:29,880
The birth was traumatic for you,

267
00:20:29,924 --> 00:20:31,882
but you'’ve been able
to talk about it
with your husband.

268
00:20:31,926 --> 00:20:33,101
Boyfriend.

269
00:20:33,841 --> 00:20:36,365
Sorry?Nothing. Nothing.

270
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:39,716
Right. But the baby,
she has no idea
what has happened.

271
00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:42,589
She needs to process too.

272
00:20:44,547 --> 00:20:47,420
You need to tell her
her story.

273
00:20:52,773 --> 00:20:54,078
Um, okay.

274
00:20:55,776 --> 00:20:56,951
Hey.

275
00:21:00,346 --> 00:21:02,957
We had kind ofa crazy birth, huh?

276
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,874
It was hard,
and it was painful...

277
00:21:07,962 --> 00:21:10,443
because the cord
was wrapped around you

278
00:21:11,357 --> 00:21:13,054
and you couldn'’t breathe.

279
00:21:13,663 --> 00:21:15,709
[coos]

280
00:21:15,752 --> 00:21:21,018
And then all these peoplerushed in, and it was bright,and it was loud,

281
00:21:21,062 --> 00:21:23,238
but those peoplewere helping you.

282
00:21:23,934 --> 00:21:25,545
You weren'’t alone.

283
00:21:26,676 --> 00:21:29,070
And we were therethe whole time.

284
00:21:29,113 --> 00:21:32,291
We were just not breathingwith you for those 90 seconds...

285
00:21:33,422 --> 00:21:34,945
and then you did.

286
00:21:36,382 --> 00:21:38,732
You breathed.

287
00:21:38,775 --> 00:21:42,039
And I know you'’re so tiredfrom all that craziness,

288
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,128
but you'’re all better now.

289
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,436
You'’re safe.

290
00:21:52,223 --> 00:21:54,878
But, my baby, you'’ve got to eat.

291
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:01,798
[babbles]

292
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:09,284
[sniffles] She'’s on.

293
00:22:12,243 --> 00:22:13,593
[chuckles]

294
00:22:29,696 --> 00:22:31,088
You see?

295
00:22:32,438 --> 00:22:34,657
Remember, we have a baby.

296
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:42,491
I'’m gonna help you make senseof everything else.

297
00:22:42,535 --> 00:22:45,799
I'’m gonna--
I'’m gonna tell you
our story, okay?

298
00:22:47,888 --> 00:22:50,934
That way you can know
that you'’re okay.

299
00:22:52,196 --> 00:22:53,720
You can know you'’re safe.

300
00:22:55,591 --> 00:22:57,114
What if you'’re wrong?

301
00:22:58,594 --> 00:23:00,596
What if it'’s a sad story?

302
00:23:02,468 --> 00:23:04,426
[knocking]No.

303
00:23:05,471 --> 00:23:07,821
It'’s not.[Patty] Sorry to wake you.

304
00:23:07,864 --> 00:23:10,084
One second, Patty.

305
00:23:10,127 --> 00:23:11,564
You need anything?

306
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:13,217
Tell her you'’re fine, please.

307
00:23:14,088 --> 00:23:15,437
I'’m not even here.

308
00:23:15,481 --> 00:23:17,526
So she'’s talking to a dead girl?

309
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:18,658
To you.

310
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:19,963
Okay.

311
00:23:21,356 --> 00:23:24,185
Okay, so you won'’t talk
to anyone for a bit. Okay?

312
00:23:24,228 --> 00:23:27,971
We'’ll stay here,
and we'’ll figure
this out ourselves.

313
00:23:28,015 --> 00:23:29,843
[Patty]
I did some laundry,

314
00:23:29,886 --> 00:23:32,933
and I was thinking
I'’d make soup tonight.

315
00:23:32,976 --> 00:23:36,632
I have to go to the store,so if you want anything...

316
00:23:36,676 --> 00:23:39,766
[Matteo] Thank you, Patty.
We'’re fine. Thank you.
Take your time.

317
00:23:41,028 --> 00:23:43,291
Okay, let'’s stay in bed.

318
00:23:44,118 --> 00:23:46,468
One step at a time. Hey.

319
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,385
Shall we start
from the beginning?

320
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,430
Of time?

321
00:23:52,213 --> 00:23:53,344
Of us.

322
00:23:55,216 --> 00:23:56,391
Fine.

323
00:23:57,827 --> 00:24:00,787
If it means you'’ll stay,then fine.

324
00:24:02,353 --> 00:24:04,921
I will stay.
Close your eyes.

325
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:11,275
[Adrienne] Where are we?What is it?[Maggie] Okay, this way.

326
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:13,277
Okay, all right, stop.
Stop. Stop.I don'’t like it.

327
00:24:13,321 --> 00:24:16,367
I don'’t want it.Okay, one, two, three.

328
00:24:16,411 --> 00:24:17,760
[all] Surprise!

329
00:24:18,935 --> 00:24:20,459
[man] Yeah![pop music playing]

330

[both laugh]

331
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:26,726
Oh, my God, you guys,this is awesome.

332
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:28,989
[chattering]

333
00:24:29,032 --> 00:24:30,338
Hey!

334
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:31,644
What is this?

335
00:24:37,388 --> 00:24:40,609
I was so uncomfortable
in the spotlight.

336
00:24:40,653 --> 00:24:43,220
Hi!And I thought
that was so cute.

337
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,614
All these people are herebecause they love you so much.

338
00:24:45,658 --> 00:24:47,311
Look, and there'’sso many snacks.

339
00:24:47,355 --> 00:24:51,794
[laughter, chattering]

00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,068
[laughs]

342
00:25:13,729 --> 00:25:15,209
I remember you blushed.

343
00:25:15,252 --> 00:25:16,906
No, I didn'’t.

344
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:19,387
Okay.What? I didn'’t.

345
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:22,346
I lured you in
with my boyish charm.
That'’s what I did.

346
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,174
[chuckles]

347
00:25:25,001 --> 00:25:28,788
Oh, yeah, this one. Shia. Sean?

350
00:25:34,141 --> 00:25:36,578
She was always just so much.

351
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:41,627
She never really talked to meafter we got together.

352
00:25:42,366 --> 00:25:43,629
She talked to you.

353
00:25:44,934 --> 00:25:47,110
I told you nothing happened
with Shea.

354
00:25:48,372 --> 00:25:50,244
Yeah, you did tell me that.

356
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:06,434
Shea got me a job
in a hotel in Palm Springs.

357
00:26:07,217 --> 00:26:09,742
All the woodwork and doors.

358
00:26:09,785 --> 00:26:12,005
With her?Just two months.

364
00:26:28,108 --> 00:26:30,632
You remember what
we talked about?

[soft, slow music playing]

366
00:26:32,982 --> 00:26:35,550
Hmm. Movies? <i>Aliens.</i>

367
00:26:36,246 --> 00:26:37,508
My love of show tunes.

368
00:26:37,552 --> 00:26:39,728
Yes, and yet,
I kept talking to you.

369
00:26:39,772 --> 00:26:43,950
[chuckles]And, oh, <i>The Bluest Eye.You love Toni Morrison.</i>

370
00:26:43,993 --> 00:26:46,126
And I wanted to give youa blow job right there.

371
00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:47,736
What? No.

372
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,129
No way.Way.

Fuck, I wish I knew.[chuckles]

374
00:26:54,134 --> 00:26:58,573
You were focused on meso intently like we werethe only ones there.

375
00:27:00,488 --> 00:27:04,535
And you told meabout your stepdad.Not that night.

376
00:27:04,579 --> 00:27:06,929
No, you did.About the last timethat you saw him.

377
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,106
Oh, yeah. I was ten.

378
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:14,110
He had his hands
around my mom'’s neck,

379
00:27:14,154 --> 00:27:17,679
so I called the cops,
and of course he denied it.

380
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:21,074
Then my mom blamed me
when he left.

381
00:27:22,292 --> 00:27:23,859
I'’m sorry.

382
00:27:23,903 --> 00:27:26,688
[scoffs, chuckles]
No, I'’m sorry.
What a downer.

[both chuckle]

384
00:27:29,517 --> 00:27:34,043
My parents are a pain,but not painful enoughthat I can get rid of them.

385
00:27:34,087 --> 00:27:36,219
That'’s too bad.

386
00:27:36,263 --> 00:27:37,960
I mean...No, I mean,
that'’s good.

387
00:27:38,004 --> 00:27:40,093
It'’s good, I guess.
[laughs]

388
00:27:40,136 --> 00:27:41,224
Anyway...Cheers.

389
00:27:49,493 --> 00:27:55,369
You can spend the nightin my room if you promiseto, um, not molest me.

390
00:27:59,112 --> 00:28:02,637
-No, wait.
That was weeks later.

391

You asked to crash on my couch.

392
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:13,126
What time'’s your meeting
in the morning?It'’s at 9:00.

393
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:16,477
Thank youfor letting me stay.

394
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,872
It'’s just that traffic
in the morning, it'’s crazy
heading this way, so...

395
00:28:19,915 --> 00:28:21,743
I thoughtit would be easier.

396
00:28:21,787 --> 00:28:24,006
Yeah, no worries.
It'’s fine.

397
00:28:26,879 --> 00:28:28,924
You know,
I lied about the meeting.

398
00:28:30,143 --> 00:28:31,622
There was no meeting.

399
00:28:33,233 --> 00:28:34,713

It was almost dawn.

403
00:28:48,161 --> 00:28:49,989
I thought you were
never gonna kiss me.

404
00:28:55,821 --> 00:28:59,433
Oh! [chuckles]I tri-- [chuckles]

Make love to me.

410

You got a condom?

411

I mean, you lighta hundred candles,and you have no condom?

415
00:29:42,128 --> 00:29:44,086

I'’m sorry.

416
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:47,960
No. What kindof feminist are you?[both laugh]

417
00:29:48,003 --> 00:29:49,788

You just left me there.

430
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,888
You just left me there to die.

431
00:30:46,932 --> 00:30:48,498
[Matteo]That'’s not what happened.

432
00:30:53,416 --> 00:30:57,638
I came back.
I came back
and put it out.

I saved the day.I was fucking Supermanthat night.

434

436
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,087
I love you.

437
00:31:13,219 --> 00:31:15,395
No, I was the onethat said it first.

438
00:31:16,962 --> 00:31:19,442
Does it matter?Yes.

439
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:23,751

some research.

448

It'’s kind of crazy what happensto people after trauma.

449
00:33:05,896 --> 00:33:08,377
I mean,
what they experience,
you know?

450
00:33:08,421 --> 00:33:10,118
Makes sense
that you feel off.

451
00:33:10,162 --> 00:33:12,860
Off?Yeah.

452
00:33:12,903 --> 00:33:15,689
What do you think happenswhen you die?

453

Nothing.What if it'’s bad?

No. No, no.
Uh, wait.

457
00:33:31,052 --> 00:33:34,012
It can'’t just be an insular
emotional repetition.

458
00:33:34,838 --> 00:33:36,405
I mean,
if it'’s not nothing,

459
00:33:36,449 --> 00:33:38,755
it'’s gotta be something biggerthan that, right?

460
00:33:41,323 --> 00:33:44,196
We'’re space dust. Right?

461
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:46,763

to be part of everything.

466

We talked about this.I saw it,and you weren'’t there.

467
00:34:05,478 --> 00:34:07,697
Hey, stop it.I saw her,and you weren'’t there.

468
00:34:07,741 --> 00:34:10,439
So maybe you were lying,and that'’s why I'm stuck here.

469
00:34:10,483 --> 00:34:13,399
I wouldn'’t lie
about that. Wait.And that'’s why I'm still here.

470
00:34:13,442 --> 00:34:14,617
No.

471

you gotta trust me
on this one. Hmm?

She'’s gonna need you.Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

477
00:34:35,464 --> 00:34:37,423
Let'’s talk about
what'’s real.

00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:39,947
What really happened.

so many times, it'’s almost
like it'’s a fantasy.

507

This was real. This is real.

508
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:28,550
[Matteo] I could stay
in this place forever.

509

00:38:09,461 --> 00:38:10,940
[chuckles]

523
00:38:19,122 --> 00:38:21,864
It'’s so sadthat we fell apart,isn'’t it?

524
00:38:24,171 --> 00:38:25,520
Yeah.

525
00:38:33,746 --> 00:38:35,704
[Matteo] What'’s wrong?What'’s happening?

526
00:38:35,748 --> 00:38:38,011
What'’s happening?Hey.

527
00:38:38,054 --> 00:38:39,969
Adrienne. What'’s wrong?[gasps]

528
00:38:40,013 --> 00:38:41,319
What'’s happening?

529
00:38:41,362 --> 00:38:44,757
[groaning]Adrienne, take a breath.

530
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,281
-[groaning]
-Adrienne, take a breath.

531
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,025
Adrienne![gasps]

532
00:38:52,068 --> 00:38:55,071
Okay. Breathe. Breathe.[groans, breathes heavily]

533
00:38:55,115 --> 00:38:57,422
Breathe. Breathe.[breathes heavily]

534
00:38:58,161 --> 00:39:00,729
Breathe. Adrienne, breathe.

535
00:39:00,773 --> 00:39:02,340
Okay. You'’re okay.

536
00:39:03,166 --> 00:39:04,385
You'’re okay.

537
00:39:04,429 --> 00:39:06,822
You keep saying that,but clearly--

538
00:39:06,866 --> 00:39:08,650
What'’s wrong?[groaning]

539
00:39:09,825 --> 00:39:12,524
The water--You didn'’t see the water.What?

540
00:39:12,567 --> 00:39:15,396
[crying]

541
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,879
Just breathe, please.
Breathe. You'’re okay.

542
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:22,403
Look me in the eyes.

543
00:39:24,187 --> 00:39:25,972
There you go.
That works.

544
00:39:28,931 --> 00:39:31,151
[sighs]

545
00:39:32,587 --> 00:39:34,981
Okay. Okay.

546
00:39:36,765 --> 00:39:39,681
Let me get you a towel.
You'’ll be fine.

547
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:42,815
Okay? Don'’t move.

548
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:47,646
[breathes heavily]

549
00:39:54,087 --> 00:39:55,741
[male voice] <i>
It'’s over now.</i>

550
00:39:57,525 --> 00:39:59,222
<i>Where'’s the baby?</i>

551
00:40:01,573 --> 00:40:03,966
No. No, you can'’t have her.

552
00:40:06,882 --> 00:40:08,362
Ellie?

553
00:40:10,146 --> 00:40:11,974
Ellie!

554
00:40:12,758 --> 00:40:14,629
Please!
Somebody help me!

555
00:40:14,673 --> 00:40:16,152
Help me!

556
00:40:16,196 --> 00:40:18,546
Somebody help me!
[crying]

557
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,243
Adrienne!

558
00:40:20,287 --> 00:40:23,812
She'’s not breathing!What is it? Stop it. Stop it.

559
00:40:23,856 --> 00:40:25,771
[Ellie crying]Let Mama have the baby.

560
00:40:25,814 --> 00:40:28,556
You'’re gonna hurt her. Steve![Matteo] What happened?

561
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,297
Let go. Let the baby go.

562
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:33,431
Oh...He can'’t have her!He can'’t have her!

563
00:40:33,474 --> 00:40:35,998
[Steve] Is she okay?[Matteo] She'’s fine.

564
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:40,133
She'’s okay.
She'’s okay.[Steve] It'’s okay.

565
00:40:40,176 --> 00:40:41,743
[Matteo] Adrienne,
what'’s going on?

566
00:40:41,787 --> 00:40:43,702
He'’s coming--He'’s coming for her.

567
00:40:43,745 --> 00:40:46,487
[crying]

568
00:40:46,531 --> 00:40:49,708
He'’s coming for her.What? What'’s coming?

569
00:40:49,751 --> 00:40:51,884
What are you
talking about?Dea--

570
00:40:53,102 --> 00:40:54,147
Death.

571
00:40:59,195 --> 00:41:03,025
[crying]

572
00:41:04,244 --> 00:41:06,333
[doctor] Your mom tells meyou'’ve been experiencing

573
00:41:06,376 --> 00:41:08,596
some confusionsince the accident.

574
00:41:09,379 --> 00:41:11,251
Are you in any pain?

575
00:41:17,649 --> 00:41:19,607
Does that hurt?I don'’t know.

576
00:41:30,618 --> 00:41:33,621
[doctor]Adrienne, can you hear me?

577
00:41:35,449 --> 00:41:36,755
Do you know what day it is?

578
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:40,846
Sorry, I'’m not really here.

579
00:41:41,934 --> 00:41:43,413
Which one is it?

580
00:41:46,765 --> 00:41:48,506
[doctor]She just needs her medicine.

581
00:41:48,549 --> 00:41:53,554
[indistinct]

582
00:41:53,598 --> 00:41:55,948
Take two pills,
three times a day...

583
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:05,566
[indistinct]

584
00:42:06,785 --> 00:42:09,135
She'’s gonna be okay.
She'’s a strong girl.

585
00:42:09,178 --> 00:42:11,137
[Steve] Thanks for coming by.I do appreciate it.

586
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,226
[Ellie crying]

587
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:20,799
Ellie wanted to say hi.Why don'’t you give her a hug?

588
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:24,846
Okay, here,
I'’ll take her.

589
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:27,675
[Patty] They'’ve got her onso many pills, I can'’t evenkeep them straight.

590
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:31,113
[Maggie] I'’m just gonna
sit here with you, okay?
Just so you know.

591
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,899
We don'’t even have to talk.

592
00:42:33,942 --> 00:42:35,596
[Patty]
She has physical therapy,

593
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,773
and an appointment
with a psychiatrist
on Tuesday.

594
00:42:38,817 --> 00:42:42,603
[Maggie] Okay, well, you knowI'’m here if she needs anything.She'’ll be fine.

595
00:42:42,647 --> 00:42:46,955
[Patty] I'’m gonna take Ellieto our place for a while,and Steve will stay with her.

596
00:42:49,218 --> 00:42:55,268
[babbling][crashing sounds]

597
00:43:00,447 --> 00:43:06,148
Children need stability,
and this just is not
a good environment for her.

598
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,934
[insurance agent]
So, the good news is,

599
00:43:08,977 --> 00:43:12,459
the other driver was at fault,per the police report.

600
00:43:15,854 --> 00:43:19,466
-Is he okay?-He isn'’t claiming any injuries.

601
00:43:19,509 --> 00:43:21,816
Will you be takingMatteo'’s statement separately

602
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:25,951
to make surewe'’re telling the truth?Because it was not his fault.

603
00:43:25,994 --> 00:43:29,215
No matter whatmy mother may have told you.

604
00:43:30,956 --> 00:43:34,524
There was a witness who said
he saw the other driver
gun through the yellow.

605
00:43:34,568 --> 00:43:36,222
Do you remember that?

606
00:43:40,792 --> 00:43:42,097
Adrienne?

607
00:43:46,275 --> 00:43:49,322
[zombies grunting][woman screams]

608
00:43:55,937 --> 00:43:57,330
Zombies?

609
00:43:57,939 --> 00:43:59,549
You hate zombies.

610
00:43:59,593 --> 00:44:01,856
They'’re my people now.

611
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:04,206
I feel really connectedto them, actually.

612
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:07,209
They'’re very misunderstood.

613
00:44:10,952 --> 00:44:12,650
I-- [exhales]

614
00:44:14,913 --> 00:44:17,829
I know there'’s
something wrong with me.

615
00:44:17,872 --> 00:44:19,221
Yeah.

616
00:44:20,875 --> 00:44:22,616
But you'’re gonna get better.

617
00:44:23,965 --> 00:44:25,445
If I was actually a zombie,

618
00:44:25,488 --> 00:44:27,839
would you tie me upand keep me in your garage?

619
00:44:27,882 --> 00:44:30,580
[scoffs, chuckles]

620
00:44:30,624 --> 00:44:33,583
Yeah, I guess so.

621
00:44:33,627 --> 00:44:36,630
I'’ve been always afraidof losing you, so, yeah.

622
00:44:38,371 --> 00:44:40,329
Because you knew you would?

623
00:44:44,594 --> 00:44:46,161
Adrienne...

624
00:44:47,597 --> 00:44:49,425
doesn'’t it make sense, right...

625
00:44:50,905 --> 00:44:52,515
that you'’re alive?

626
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:56,389
That people can see you?They talk to you.

627
00:44:57,477 --> 00:44:59,174
You are here.

628
00:44:59,218 --> 00:45:00,872
But I feel soulless.

629
00:45:03,352 --> 00:45:04,789
Hollowed out.

630
00:45:09,532 --> 00:45:13,623
Do you remember when we realizedwe were having a baby?

631
00:45:13,667 --> 00:45:15,713
Please don'’t.

632
00:45:15,756 --> 00:45:19,804
You keep trying to prove
that I'’m okay,
but I can prove I'’m not.

633
00:45:20,935 --> 00:45:22,720
Can I tell you something?

634
00:45:25,635 --> 00:45:28,203
Yeah.I knew I was gonna die.

635
00:45:30,553 --> 00:45:31,990
What do you mean?

636
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:38,126
She told me,when we went to the houseto look at the broken window.

637
00:45:43,088 --> 00:45:44,916
[chuckles]

638
00:45:44,959 --> 00:45:46,744
I'’m gonna check the window.

639
00:45:46,787 --> 00:45:48,310
Hi.[young woman]
Hey, welcome.

640
00:45:48,354 --> 00:45:50,443
Hey! How are you?[young woman] Hey!

641
00:45:51,879 --> 00:45:54,534
What are you guys doing?A reading.

642
00:45:54,577 --> 00:45:57,493
Oh, yeah?I'’m an assistant
to Psychic Elaine.

643
00:45:59,017 --> 00:46:01,454
She'’s, like, the best in LA,
like, the real, real deal.

644
00:46:01,497 --> 00:46:05,284
Like, not a storefront,
like, otherworldly,
and I'’m studying under her.

645
00:46:05,327 --> 00:46:06,764
Wow.

646
00:46:06,807 --> 00:46:08,635
You want me
to do a reading on you?

647
00:46:08,678 --> 00:46:12,421
Sure, why not?I can get you later.

648
00:46:12,465 --> 00:46:16,208
Just don'’t tell me I feel oldbecause I thinkthat much is obvious.

649
00:46:16,251 --> 00:46:18,558
[chuckles]

650
00:46:18,601 --> 00:46:21,517
Weird,your lifeline'’s really short.

651
00:46:21,561 --> 00:46:22,997
What?

652
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:25,043
I mean, it doesn'’t
necessarily mean death.

653
00:46:25,086 --> 00:46:27,132
It could be like--
like you'’re not living,

654
00:46:27,175 --> 00:46:28,873
like you'’re not living life
to the fullest.

655
00:46:28,916 --> 00:46:31,832
Um... Or I could be
doing it wrong.

656
00:46:31,876 --> 00:46:36,141
No. Yes, it'’s crazy.I'’m-- It's true.

657
00:46:36,968 --> 00:46:38,404
I'’m dead.

658
00:46:38,447 --> 00:46:42,495
I die in a car accident,two weeks after this.

659
00:46:42,538 --> 00:46:46,673
Whoa. That is crazy.

660
00:46:46,716 --> 00:46:49,632
We'’ll never get to
move into this house.
It sucks.

661
00:46:49,676 --> 00:46:52,766
But if you knew,why did you let yourselfget into the car?

662
00:46:53,636 --> 00:46:54,724
Did you want to die?

663
00:46:56,901 --> 00:46:58,206
I don'’t know. I--

664
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:01,035
This is graspingat straws, Adrienne.

665
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:02,645
It'’s coincidence.

666
00:47:02,689 --> 00:47:04,647
That'’s what you said to her,
but then...

667
00:47:04,691 --> 00:47:07,085
How old were youwhen your mother died?

668
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,348
What...

669
00:47:09,391 --> 00:47:12,307
Did-Did-Did you tell her?No, I swear I didn'’t.

670
00:47:12,351 --> 00:47:14,048
He was 17.

671
00:47:14,092 --> 00:47:15,963
She'’s lingering for you.

672
00:47:16,007 --> 00:47:18,357
There'’s something
unresolved.

673
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,273
She says she wishesthat you spoke at her funeral.

674
00:47:21,316 --> 00:47:23,753
[scoffs]That'’s it.

675
00:47:23,797 --> 00:47:26,800
[laughs] Uh...

676
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:29,934
Okay. That'’s our cue
to go. Sorry.

677
00:47:29,977 --> 00:47:32,850
You never told me.
Was that true?Ye-- No.

678
00:47:32,893 --> 00:47:35,678
Well, yes. Yes.
Yes, it was true.

679
00:47:35,722 --> 00:47:37,985
I was young.
I didn'’t know what to say.

680
00:47:38,029 --> 00:47:40,335
I was mad at her,
but that doesn'’t prove

681
00:47:40,379 --> 00:47:42,207
that she'’s psychicor that you'’re dead.

682
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:45,775
I kept asking myself
again and again,
what is the point of life?

683
00:47:45,819 --> 00:47:48,909
Of us. You kept asking yourselfwhat'’s the point of us.

684
00:47:48,953 --> 00:47:53,566
But then when I left Gary
and Kevin'’s that night,
I had a really bad feeling.

685
00:47:53,609 --> 00:47:54,872
[Matteo] Adrienne...

686
00:47:57,526 --> 00:47:58,963
Hey!I had this feeling

687
00:47:59,006 --> 00:48:01,139
like everything
was falling apart.

688
00:48:05,317 --> 00:48:06,840
[Matteo] Adrienne.

689
00:48:09,451 --> 00:48:12,759
You were pissed at me.If we hadn'’t bought the house,

690
00:48:12,802 --> 00:48:14,935
none of this would'’ve happened.
What? It could'’ve been
a plane crash.

691
00:48:14,979 --> 00:48:16,371
It'’s my fault.Stop trying to find meaning

692
00:48:16,415 --> 00:48:18,504
in something meaningless
and random.

693
00:48:18,547 --> 00:48:20,636
You didn'’t cause
the accident.

694
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:22,812
If there'’s someone to blame,
it'’s me. Yeah.

695
00:48:22,856 --> 00:48:25,859
I wanted to go outthat night, so we did.I didn'’t see the guy coming.

696
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:29,732
No, no, no.
I didn'’t see the guy coming.
I wanted to stay late.

697
00:48:29,776 --> 00:48:32,910
Hey, stop hijacking this.
Let me finish the story.

698
00:48:32,953 --> 00:48:36,304
I don'’t want youto finish your story.I want you to tell the truth.

699
00:48:36,348 --> 00:48:37,958
You want the truth?Yes!

700
00:48:38,002 --> 00:48:40,439
Fine.
It wasn'’t all good.

701
00:48:40,482 --> 00:48:42,876
Do you remember
that work event?

702
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,793
You had just gotten your jobdoing grunt work at the museum.

703
00:48:46,836 --> 00:48:48,795
[Adrienne]
Oh, my God. Grunt work?

704
00:48:48,838 --> 00:48:51,972
I'’m managingmajor design installations.This is not grunt work.

705
00:48:52,016 --> 00:48:53,931
I don'’t know
why you took it.

706
00:48:53,974 --> 00:48:56,281
Well, aside from the factthat it'’s my dream job,

707
00:48:56,324 --> 00:48:58,152
some people actually haveto work for a living,

708
00:48:58,196 --> 00:49:01,373
so thatthey can support their family,so they can buy a house.

709
00:49:01,416 --> 00:49:02,635
Okay, yeah?Thank you.

710
00:49:02,678 --> 00:49:04,550
Have piles of shit, right?Thank you.

711
00:49:04,593 --> 00:49:06,552
You don'’t want things?
You don'’t want tools
and tech toys

712
00:49:06,595 --> 00:49:08,946
and whatever other shit it isyou get shipped directto your garage?

713
00:49:08,989 --> 00:49:11,209
Okay, I'’m just saying thatif we stay in the apartment,

714
00:49:11,252 --> 00:49:16,301
we have a low rent,we keep some freedom, andwe'’re not tied to a mortgage.

715
00:49:16,344 --> 00:49:19,130
If you'’re never tied
to anything,
then you'’ll never be free.

716
00:49:20,044 --> 00:49:21,697
What musical is that from?

717
00:49:22,872 --> 00:49:24,831
It'’s from <i>Pippin.
It doesn'’t--[laughs]</i>

718
00:49:24,874 --> 00:49:27,007
Doesn'’t mean that
it'’s not true.

719
00:49:27,051 --> 00:49:29,227
What about this beautifuladventure we'’re on?

720
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:32,534
You'’re going to be working
from 9:00 to 9:00 every day.

721
00:49:32,578 --> 00:49:38,018
Gonna be laden with kids,
the house, with no time
to go anywhere.

722
00:49:38,062 --> 00:49:41,935
Not everyone can
not finish school
and not get a real job...

723
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:43,241
I have a real job....and not care.

724
00:49:43,284 --> 00:49:45,939
I have a real job.This is what I want.

725
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:49,856
If you don'’t want it too,
you should just...
get out of my way.

726
00:49:56,428 --> 00:49:57,472
See?

727
00:49:59,344 --> 00:50:00,954
Where do you go?

728
00:50:06,133 --> 00:50:09,397
[Liam] Adrienne.Hey! How are you?

729
00:50:09,441 --> 00:50:11,051
I'’m good. Champagne?

730
00:50:11,095 --> 00:50:12,879
Mind reader. Thank you.

731
00:50:14,446 --> 00:50:17,057
[Matteo]The look in your eyes. So alive.

732
00:50:17,101 --> 00:50:19,233
He is a work colleague,
and he'’s on the board.

733
00:50:19,277 --> 00:50:21,714
I am supposed
to be nice to him.Thank you.

734
00:50:21,757 --> 00:50:24,499
For what?For making this eventworth attending.

735
00:50:24,543 --> 00:50:29,504
I'’m-- Yeah. Frida Kahlo
and Maya Deren in one space?
Be still, my heart.

736
00:50:29,548 --> 00:50:33,682
[chuckles]Yeah. I know I should be focusedon the art, but I just can'’t.

737
00:50:33,726 --> 00:50:35,945
Why?You'’re distracting me.

738
00:50:35,989 --> 00:50:38,818
I just-- I threw on...

739
00:50:38,861 --> 00:50:41,386
like, frazzled, like,
whatever work thing.

740
00:50:42,909 --> 00:50:44,954
Don'’t underestimate
yourself.

741
00:50:51,831 --> 00:50:56,140
Okay, fine. Fine.
You saw that. So what?
So what?

742
00:50:57,619 --> 00:51:00,013
I'’m sorry. Matteo is trying
to prove that I'’m alive

743
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:04,496
by making me feel,
what, like, guilty? Thanks.

744
00:51:04,539 --> 00:51:06,846
He invited meto check out his woodworking.

745
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:10,284
The same night?Yeah, I think so.

746
00:51:10,937 --> 00:51:12,417
I bought a bench.

747
00:51:25,386 --> 00:51:27,040
[Matteo laughs][Liam] Oh!

748
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:29,869
Here it comes.Such terror.

749
00:51:29,912 --> 00:51:31,610
You told me
it was referred
by a friend.

750
00:51:31,653 --> 00:51:33,264
[Liam] How did you kill me
that fast?

751
00:51:33,307 --> 00:51:35,309
I didn'’t even know
you guys knew each other.

752
00:51:35,353 --> 00:51:36,919
Hmm. So you lied.

753
00:51:36,963 --> 00:51:40,488
Now you know the truth.
Feel better?

754
00:51:40,532 --> 00:51:43,100
I'’m just saying,most guys would punch a guy

755
00:51:43,143 --> 00:51:44,971
who was making moveson their girlfriend.

756
00:51:45,014 --> 00:51:48,453
[chuckles] Okay.
You wanted me to punch him?

757
00:51:48,496 --> 00:51:51,108
He'’s got six inches on me.
No way.

758
00:51:51,151 --> 00:51:52,805
Why didn'’t you just tell meyou were jealous?

759
00:51:52,848 --> 00:51:55,199
I didn'’t thinkI could do anything about it.

760
00:51:56,417 --> 00:51:59,725
I mean, probably delay it.
Did I?

761
00:52:00,465 --> 00:52:02,423
I didn'’t cheat on you.

762
00:52:03,424 --> 00:52:05,513
-Did you want to?
-It doesn'’t matter.

763
00:52:05,557 --> 00:52:07,950
It matters.
It fucking matters.

764
00:52:15,784 --> 00:52:17,612
[Ellie crying]

765
00:52:17,656 --> 00:52:19,658
Bullshit! Bullshit!That-- That never happened.

766
00:52:19,701 --> 00:52:22,704
Okay. Look me in the eyeand tell me I am making this up.

767
00:52:22,748 --> 00:52:24,750
You live so in your head.
You exaggerate things.

768
00:52:24,793 --> 00:52:26,317
You conflate things.Stop lying to me.

769
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:29,624
Stop ignoring--Stop disappearing on me.

770
00:52:29,668 --> 00:52:31,191
On our baby.

771
00:52:31,235 --> 00:52:34,151
Even me dying isn'’t enoughto get you to step up.

772
00:52:36,327 --> 00:52:38,329
It'’s so unfair you expect me
to fail.

773
00:52:39,547 --> 00:52:41,941
You can'’t pretend to know
what'’s going to happen,

774
00:52:41,984 --> 00:52:44,161
how I would feel
if I lost you.

775
00:52:45,336 --> 00:52:47,468
What fucking living hell
that would be for me.

776
00:52:50,254 --> 00:52:53,257
Maybe I would never recover.

777
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:55,781
Maybe I would be no good
for Ellie.

778
00:52:57,304 --> 00:52:59,132
Maybe I would break
if I lost you.

779
00:53:01,221 --> 00:53:02,570
[doorbell rings]

780
00:53:04,659 --> 00:53:06,183
Who is that?

781
00:53:06,748 --> 00:53:07,836
I'’m gonna check.

782
00:53:11,013 --> 00:53:13,102
[priest] Hi, Steve.
How you holding up?

783
00:53:14,016 --> 00:53:15,931
[Patty]
Hello, Father Richard.

784
00:53:15,975 --> 00:53:18,064
Proof that I'’m dead.

785
00:53:18,107 --> 00:53:22,068
[Matteo] Your mother calls
Father Richard if the milk
is past its due date.

786
00:53:22,111 --> 00:53:25,376
Adrienne,
I'’m planning a bingo night
at the church.

787
00:53:26,681 --> 00:53:28,074
What are you doing?

788
00:53:28,117 --> 00:53:30,642
I'’m trying...
I'’m trying to work out

789
00:53:30,685 --> 00:53:32,426
what to be buried in.What?

790
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:34,602
This one actuallydoesn'’t zip up at the back,

791
00:53:34,646 --> 00:53:37,083
but if you leave it unzipped,I don'’t think anybody'sgonna notice.

792
00:53:37,126 --> 00:53:38,737
Slow down.Actually,

793
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:41,348
I think I would rather bescattered somewhere beautiful.

794
00:53:41,392 --> 00:53:43,394
Oh, okay.

795
00:53:43,437 --> 00:53:46,135
You have a second chance,
Matteo, and you'’ve just got
to move on.

796
00:53:46,179 --> 00:53:49,313
-[scoffs]
-And you gotta find somebody
that you love.

797
00:53:49,356 --> 00:53:50,966
Not Shea.Please don'’t marry Shea.

798
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:52,446
[chuckles]

799
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:55,884
Somebody-- Somebody educatedand somebody funny.

800
00:53:57,059 --> 00:54:00,802
Find somebody funny
and just love them.

801
00:54:00,846 --> 00:54:02,717
And let them love you.It'’s gonna be weird

802
00:54:02,761 --> 00:54:05,590
to bring a girl
with my dead girlfriend
still in my bed, right?

803
00:54:05,633 --> 00:54:10,595
And I want my funeral to be fun.Not in a church, please.

804
00:54:10,638 --> 00:54:12,118
Okay.No matter what my mother says.

805
00:54:12,161 --> 00:54:15,252
We'’ll have a dance-pop
party funeral.

806
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,905
You'’re the one
who likes pop music.

807
00:54:16,949 --> 00:54:19,299
I don'’t like pop music.
I want Missy Elliott.

808
00:54:19,343 --> 00:54:23,521
Okay, we'’ll have a bunch
of geriatrics dancing
to Missy Elliott.

809
00:54:23,564 --> 00:54:26,437
Man, life.

810
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,440
Perfect.What a tricky little minx.

811
00:54:32,573 --> 00:54:34,227
Hey, stop. Stop!

812
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:35,794
Stop!

813
00:54:35,837 --> 00:54:38,492
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.

814
00:54:38,536 --> 00:54:40,102
What the fuck are you doing?

815
00:54:42,975 --> 00:54:45,194
You don'’t get
to be dead yet, okay?

816
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:49,242
Fuck. So impatient.

817
00:54:58,469 --> 00:54:59,905
Adrienne.

818
00:55:03,256 --> 00:55:04,518
Hey.

819
00:55:09,523 --> 00:55:12,613
Look at me.
So impatient.

820
00:55:14,049 --> 00:55:15,573
Shh, shh.

821
00:55:15,616 --> 00:55:18,793
Even having kids.
You remember it? Last year.

822
00:55:19,751 --> 00:55:21,405
<i>Día de Muertos.</i>

823
00:55:25,583 --> 00:55:27,062
Stay with me.

824
00:55:27,715 --> 00:55:29,413
I know you remember.

825
00:55:34,722 --> 00:55:38,770
[chattering]

826
00:55:40,902 --> 00:55:42,687
[man 1] Yeah.[man 2] Okay.

827
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:44,776
-I'’d be down.
-[man 1] Can we get two
of those, please?

828
00:55:44,819 --> 00:55:47,909
Okay, I gotta say this quick.Uh, A wants a baby.

829
00:55:47,953 --> 00:55:50,129
-What?
-Here is a cute--

830
00:55:50,172 --> 00:55:52,871
She'’s gonna break up with youif you don'’t pull the goalieright now.

831
00:55:52,914 --> 00:55:55,743
What the--
We just started talking
about this.

832
00:55:57,092 --> 00:55:58,703
He shouldn'’t
have told you that.

833
00:55:58,746 --> 00:56:00,922
She said she was going topoke a hole in her diaphragm.

834
00:56:00,966 --> 00:56:02,620
I was kidding.

835
00:56:02,663 --> 00:56:04,404
I was kidding,
obviously.

836
00:56:04,448 --> 00:56:05,971
Okay, it didn'’t sound likeyou were kidding.

837
00:56:06,014 --> 00:56:07,886
Maggie.I'’m just being honest.

838
00:56:07,929 --> 00:56:10,628
Okay, she was upset,
and I talked her down.

839
00:56:10,671 --> 00:56:12,412
So impatient.

840
00:56:12,456 --> 00:56:15,633
I'’m just asking youto be patientwith me, with us.

841
00:56:17,286 --> 00:56:20,159
May I finish the story?Okay, sure.

842
00:56:20,202 --> 00:56:23,118
I remember
what else happened
that day.

843
00:56:23,162 --> 00:56:25,773
Fucking Matteo!

844
00:56:25,817 --> 00:56:28,907
Hi! You said
you were out of town.

845
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:30,561
Uh...[chuckles]

846
00:56:30,604 --> 00:56:33,128
No. No. Um...[chuckles]

847
00:56:33,172 --> 00:56:35,348
The-The trip got canceled.Oh...

848
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:37,829
It'’s so funny that Shea wouldknow about a trip of yoursthat got canceled,

849
00:56:37,872 --> 00:56:41,398
'’cause you guys don't talk.This is not why I broughtthis memory up.

850
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:43,530
Hey!Shea.

851
00:56:43,574 --> 00:56:47,142
Hi! Wow, you look so great.Hi. So do you, always.

852
00:56:47,186 --> 00:56:48,796
How are you guys?[Adrienne] Great.

853
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,537
Yeah? Are you married yet?[Matteo] Uh-huh.

854
00:56:50,581 --> 00:56:52,191
Oh, God, no.

855
00:56:52,234 --> 00:56:55,150
No, I cannot bear the idea
of letting this oaf own me,

856
00:56:55,194 --> 00:56:59,459
but it'’s so great
that you guys still talk,
that you kept in touch.

857
00:56:59,503 --> 00:57:02,897
Even though you swore to me
that you didn'’t talk
to her anymore. Liar.

858
00:57:02,941 --> 00:57:06,118
Of course.
I'’m sorry we haven't talked.
That'’s so--

859
00:57:06,161 --> 00:57:09,121
That'’s stupid.
It'’s so stupid.No, totally. Right, right.

860
00:57:09,164 --> 00:57:10,688
We should have lunch. Lie.

861

um, woodworking?

863
00:57:14,953 --> 00:57:16,563
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.Oh.

864
00:57:16,607 --> 00:57:19,044
Amazing, because my dadjust bought this huge property.

865
00:57:19,087 --> 00:57:21,568
So I actually, um--
I might have a job for you.

866
00:57:21,612 --> 00:57:22,700
Oh, really?Yeah.

867
00:57:22,743 --> 00:57:24,484
That'’s so sweet.Yeah.

868
00:57:24,528 --> 00:57:26,921
This was the beginning
of the end, wasn'’t it?

869
00:57:26,965 --> 00:57:29,097
What? No, no, no, no.Cool, so, um...

871
00:57:31,143 --> 00:57:33,362
It was so good
to see you, girl.

[chuckles]

877
00:57:43,547 --> 00:57:46,071
Why don'’t you just be
with Shea, Matteo?

878
00:57:46,114 --> 00:57:48,595
Are you crazy?If I wanted to be with her,I would be.

879
00:57:48,639 --> 00:57:51,206
Is that a threat?No, I'’m just saying,
I'’m with you.

880
00:57:54,558 --> 00:57:56,864
God, I was so much, wasn'’t I?

881
00:57:57,648 --> 00:57:59,867
No. We made up, didn'’t we?

882
00:58:00,651 --> 00:58:02,130
Did we?Yeah.

883
00:58:03,088 --> 00:58:04,611
Yeah, yeah, yeah. This--

884
00:58:04,655 --> 00:58:07,484
This wasn'’t the beginningof the end.

885
00:58:07,527 --> 00:58:09,529
This was the moment when we...

886
00:58:10,661 --> 00:58:11,879
when I told you...

887
00:58:14,012 --> 00:58:15,274
Hey.

888
00:58:15,317 --> 00:58:17,929
I wanna have babies
with you, okay?

889
00:58:19,104 --> 00:58:20,148
I wanna have a kid.

890
00:58:21,889 --> 00:58:23,282
Let'’s have a baby.

891
00:58:25,197 --> 00:58:28,374
You only agreed
because I threatened
to leave you if you didn'’t.

892
00:58:28,417 --> 00:58:32,073
Okay, yeah,
but I still agreed. Right?

893
00:58:33,945 --> 00:58:35,381
Because I wanted to.

894
00:58:36,251 --> 00:58:38,993
You'’re right. Let's do it.

895
00:58:42,170 --> 00:58:43,607
No, what'’s wrong?

896
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:46,784
I'’m so glad you said yes.

897
00:58:48,002 --> 00:58:49,961
And I'’m so glad
we had Ellie.

898
00:59:07,369 --> 00:59:10,024
Hey, what'’s wrong?I said yes, right?

899
00:59:21,253 --> 00:59:22,559

Wake up!

910
01:00:16,482 --> 01:00:19,572
Fuck. Don'’t do that
to me, please.

911
01:00:23,707 --> 01:00:25,317
I don'’t know
how to help you.

912
01:00:26,797 --> 01:00:28,363
This is bigger than me.

913
01:00:31,410 --> 01:00:32,541
You saw it.

914
01:00:34,718 --> 01:00:36,633
No, I didn'’t see anything.

915
01:00:42,377 --> 01:00:44,292
Let'’s get you out
of this thing.

916
01:01:08,795 --> 01:01:09,970
I give up.

917
01:01:11,929 --> 01:01:13,931
I can'’t do this anymore.

918
01:01:38,303 --> 01:01:39,521
Wait.

919
01:01:57,757 --> 01:01:59,628
Okay.

920
01:01:59,672 --> 01:02:03,458
I guess
I'’ll go avoid your mom.

927
01:04:06,059 --> 01:04:07,191
I can'’t.

928
01:04:08,757 --> 01:04:10,629
You can'’t help me.

929
01:04:10,672 --> 01:04:12,022
What if you'’re wrong?

930
01:04:16,896 --> 01:04:18,898
Adrienne.

931
01:04:18,942 --> 01:04:22,336
You want this to be the truthEllie has to live withher whole life?

932
01:04:28,603 --> 01:04:30,518
Don'’t talk to me about truth.

933
01:04:37,612 --> 01:04:39,179
You were right about Shea.

934
01:04:46,534 --> 01:04:47,884
What you saw.

935
01:04:53,977 --> 01:04:56,980
[Ellie crying]

936
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:01,680
Look, it'’s a job,
a well-paid job.

937
01:05:01,723 --> 01:05:04,074
We can'’t afford
to both take time off.[mumbles]

938
01:05:04,117 --> 01:05:06,424
No, you look, Matteo.

939
01:05:06,467 --> 01:05:10,384
You brought this babyinto the world, a bastard.

940
01:05:10,428 --> 01:05:13,126
Mom.Well, she is.You did that.

941
01:05:13,170 --> 01:05:14,432
It'’s the truth.

942
01:05:14,475 --> 01:05:17,000
And now you turn your backon her?

943
01:05:17,043 --> 01:05:19,698
Look, Patty,
go fuck yourself. Okay?

944
01:05:19,741 --> 01:05:21,178
Matteo!What?

945
01:05:21,221 --> 01:05:23,832
You'’re gonna defend her crap?Mom. Mom.

946
01:05:23,876 --> 01:05:26,052
Please--I'’m sorry.
I'’m sorry, Adrienne.

947
01:05:26,096 --> 01:05:27,706
I can'’t be around this.

948
01:05:28,576 --> 01:05:30,535
Thank fucking God!

949
01:05:30,578 --> 01:05:32,624
Are you kidding me?

950
01:05:32,667 --> 01:05:36,236
That was the only help I had,the only person I had.

951
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:37,977
Please,stop being dramatic, okay?

952
01:05:38,021 --> 01:05:39,109
Me?

953
01:05:40,762 --> 01:05:44,549
You'’re the one who left.
You'’re the one
who couldn'’t handle it.

954
01:06:05,265 --> 01:06:08,355
And I stood there foreverjust hoping you would come back.

955
01:06:17,451 --> 01:06:19,801
Slow down,or you'’re going to getin an accident.

956
01:06:19,845 --> 01:06:23,675
I didn'’t.
I just needed an escape.

957
01:06:27,809 --> 01:06:30,682
I was afraid of being
like my stepfather.

958
01:06:31,596 --> 01:06:33,815
Of family, of all of it.

959
01:06:33,859 --> 01:06:36,514
All my life tryingto avoid becoming that man,

960
01:06:36,557 --> 01:06:39,169
and here I am,
just turning into him.

961
01:06:39,212 --> 01:06:41,649
You'’re not him.
You'’re nothing like him.

962
01:06:41,693 --> 01:06:44,957
And when I got back to you,I swear, nothing happened

963
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:46,872
because I was afraid
you would...

964
01:06:48,178 --> 01:06:51,181
I was afraidI would lose you if I told you.

965
01:06:56,229 --> 01:06:57,622
Tell me now.

And then...

971
01:07:36,530 --> 01:07:37,749
[Adrienne]And then what?

972
01:07:39,403 --> 01:07:40,665
And then, I stopped.

973
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:45,626
Because I felt like
you were there.

974
01:07:46,366 --> 01:07:47,976
Like you were right there.

975
01:07:49,326 --> 01:07:51,632
And I couldn'’t be anything
but yours.

976
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:55,767
It was never clearer to me.

977
01:07:57,377 --> 01:08:02,426
I was just so ashamed of lyingand of failing.

978
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:10,869
I should have been honestabout feeling overwhelmed.

979
01:08:11,565 --> 01:08:12,827
I should have stayed.

980
01:08:17,005 --> 01:08:19,573
I should have stood up for youwith my mom. I just--

981
01:08:20,835 --> 01:08:22,402
No wonder you left.

982
01:08:22,446 --> 01:08:26,189
I just made it so hard
for you to love me.No.

983
01:08:26,232 --> 01:08:30,018
I was always tearing it down
and pulling you apart.

984
01:08:30,062 --> 01:08:31,107
No.

985
01:08:31,890 --> 01:08:33,109

We still have time.

991
01:09:10,233 --> 01:09:12,670
We just got to hold on to it.

Even if it gets messyand hard.

993
01:09:19,067 --> 01:09:20,808
Take the good and the bad.
