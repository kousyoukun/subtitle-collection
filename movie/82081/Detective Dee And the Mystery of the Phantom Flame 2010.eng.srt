1
00:00:49,709 --> 00:00:52,791
ln 689 A.D.

2
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:58,249
upon Emperor Tang Gaozhong's death

3
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:05,291
Empress Wu, a regent for 7 years,

4
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:10,208
would soon be coronated

5
00:01:12,334 --> 00:01:16,916
as history's first female Emperor.

6
00:01:20,542 --> 00:01:23,791
Royal clansmen and founding officials

7
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:27,833
resented a woman usurping the throne

8
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:31,833
and colluded...

9
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:35,666
to overthrow her reign.

10
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:43,458
Behind its peaceful faÃ§ade the capital
was lurking with danger.

11
00:01:46,167 --> 00:01:49,916
All hell was about to break loose...

12
00:02:01,084 --> 00:02:05,874
Detective Dee and the Mystery
of the Phantom Flame

13
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,291
The Empress hereby decrees:

14
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:30,374
The Court of State Ceremonials shall
welcome Umayyad diplomat Aspar

15
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:36,958
and escort him to the Towering Buddha
to revere the Empress's divine glory.

16
00:02:44,084 --> 00:02:46,999
This is Master Jia.

17
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:49,916
The Buddha is sixty-six yards high

18
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,708
symbolizing the sixty-sixth heaven
or the ninth cloud.

19
00:02:54,792 --> 00:02:58,874
-Please translate for the General.
-I already explained it to the General.

20
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,666
Does this project need
to be finished before the Coronation?

21
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,791
The General asked
if it will be ready before the Coronation.

22
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:11,958
Sure, or my life will not be spared.

23
00:03:21,417 --> 00:03:24,083
This is so spectacular!

24
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:27,708
Huge resources have been spent on this.

25
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:33,624
Two million catties of metal were used.
More than 1000 catties are melted each day.

26
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:37,624
The temperature is too high here.

27
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:41,666
Bring water and a towel for the General!

28
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:47,166
It's too hot.
We need water to avoid dehydration.

29
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:56,749
Who is the person in the painting?

30
00:03:56,834 --> 00:04:00,041
The General asked whose portrait this is.

31
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,749
This is Lu Li, our Imperial Chaplain.

32
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:06,291
He's very powerful
and trusted by the Empress!

33
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:09,791
These are amulets
bestowed by the Chaplain.

34
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,874
They can dispel evil and thwart disaster.

35
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,124
Master Jia is here.

36
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:19,333
Is somebody going to speak with him?
What shall we do?

37
00:04:19,417 --> 00:04:22,833
We had better speak up

38
00:04:22,917 --> 00:04:25,333
before lives are lost!

39
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,083
Who should do that?

40
00:04:31,042 --> 00:04:33,249
You go.

41
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:37,833
Let's go up from here.

42
00:04:37,917 --> 00:04:40,833
Today's so clear
we can see for miles from up there!

43
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,499
Lift him up.

44
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:58,416
This tubular pillar is crucial to the Buddha.

45
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,291
It's 82 yards long
and made from one casting.

46
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,916
It is surrounded by 81 steel chains.

47
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,708
In the face of hurricanes or earthquakes,
the chains will pull in the opposite direction,

48
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:13,708
-preventing the Buddha from collapsing.
-They're here. Mind your step.

49
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:21,708
General, these are the Buddha's two eyes.
And here...

50
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:25,791
-Master Jia... Master Jia...
-What's the matter?

51
00:05:26,917 --> 00:05:30,416
Please go ahead.

52
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,249
What is it?

53
00:05:32,334 --> 00:05:35,499
When you inspected the pillar yesterday,
you removed some amulets.

54
00:05:35,584 --> 00:05:39,499
-Should we put them back?
-They haven't been put back?

55
00:05:39,584 --> 00:05:43,041
Moving the amulets
will bring bad luck, so...

56
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:47,041
ever since you moved them,
everybody has been scared.

57
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:55,583
-Our work has been suffering.
-Put them back right away. Hurry up.

58
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:58,249
This way, please.

59
00:06:06,917 --> 00:06:08,666
Please...

60
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:19,499
Magnificent.
You can see the whole Empire from here.

61
00:06:19,584 --> 00:06:23,958
From here you'll be able to see
the Queen's Coronation.

62
00:06:24,042 --> 00:06:28,916
He says we can see
the Coronation stage from here.

63
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,458
From here it looks like the Sun
is very close to us. Marvellous.

64
00:06:33,542 --> 00:06:36,083
The General says...

65
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:48,249
He's on fire! He's burning!

-MasterXue
-Huh?

78
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,333
Sir, the corpse has been burnt to ashes.
No flesh was left.

79
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:20,916
Any forensic findings from the corpse?

80
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:29,666
Sir! We found this on the corpse.

81
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,583
Phosphorus!

82
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,291
The corpse is filled with it!

83
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:41,666
In order to melt the copper, there is
a lot of phosphorus inside the Buddha.

84
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:48,333
I bet this gave the murderer the opportunity
to use what was already at the scene.

85
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:55,916
Master Jia was burnt by yellow phosphorus!

86
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,916
No!

87
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:07,333
The flame ignited inside his body.

88
00:09:07,417 --> 00:09:10,666
Pei? How could the flame
ignite inside him?

89
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,583
Sir, have a look.

90
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,999
The bones were burnt to ashes.

91
00:09:17,084 --> 00:09:20,916
Though there are ashes inside the shoe,
its outside remains unscathed.

92
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,249
The flame must have burnt from inside
to leave such remains.

93
00:09:25,334 --> 00:09:26,583
Perhaps!

94
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:31,999
But the corpse is dense with phosphorus.
Someone must have poisoned his food!

95
00:09:32,084 --> 00:09:34,291
Phosphorus stinks. He couldn't miss it.

96
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,124
Even if he had taken it by mistake,

97
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:39,541
the symptoms should be shortness
of breath and bodily pain.

98
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:40,916
He shouldn't burst into flames.

99
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:44,458
Cut the crap.

100
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,166
The murderer is among you.

101
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,249
Take them all back for interrogation!

102
00:09:57,792 --> 00:09:59,458
Sir...

103
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,374
Sir.

104
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:04,708
You!

105
00:10:04,792 --> 00:10:06,583
The supervisor!

106
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:14,333
Sir, if you arrest me, our work
will be delayed and we'll be doomed.

107
00:10:14,417 --> 00:10:15,541
What's in your left hand?

108
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,083
What is this?

109
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:26,458
I was punished by the Ministry of Justice,

110
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:38,708
and was jailed for eight years for being
involved in Detective Dee's treason.

111
00:10:38,792 --> 00:10:41,374
Treason?

112
00:10:44,292 --> 00:10:47,041
A fool like you involved in treason?

113
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:58,999
Sir, if the Buddha isn't finished on time,
the Empress will blame us.

114
00:10:59,084 --> 00:11:02,083
The Supreme Court
won't be any better off either.

115
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:05,583
You dare to threaten us with the Empress?

116
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:08,458
Good. I'll give you what you want.

117
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:13,666
I'll chop your right hand off as well.

118
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:16,791
He was struck by divine intervention!

119
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:20,749
Master Jia was struck by divine intervention!

120
00:11:20,834 --> 00:11:22,291
Out of my way!

121
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:27,291
What's this crap? Divine intervention?

122
00:11:28,834 --> 00:11:35,041
Master Jia... moved the amulets
during his inspection a few days ago.

123
00:11:38,542 --> 00:11:40,166
Amulets?

124
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:56,916
Sir...

125
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,874
What superstition!

126
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,874
Divine intervention?

127
00:12:07,292 --> 00:12:10,374
Let divine intervention strike me now!

128
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:17,374
Arrest all those who went to the top today
and take them back to the Supreme Court.

129
00:12:24,459 --> 00:12:30,208
Donglai, you come with me to the Palace.
Everybody else remains on guard here.

130
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:34,624
This case is very important.
I need to report to the Empress in person.

131
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:36,416
-Yes, Sir!
-Yes, Sir!

132
00:12:57,667 --> 00:13:03,291
Your Majesty, General Yao just entered,
leading 200 soldiers from Longzhou.

133
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:10,374
Following behind is General Qiu,
with an army of 600 to protect Your Majesty.

134
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,874
Your Majesty, Master Xue of
the Supreme Court and his subordinate Pei

135
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,708
-request an audience!
-Let them approach!

136
00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:34,583
Your Majesty, Pei Donglai
of the Supreme Court.

137
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:40,083
Regarding the torched death of Jia Yi,
my preliminary investigation indicates...

138
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:52,541
-Protect Her Majesty!
-On guard!

139
00:14:30,084 --> 00:14:32,583
The Empress hereby decrees:

140
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:37,708
2000 more imperial guards shall
be garrisoned inside the palace.

141
00:14:37,792 --> 00:14:42,583
Going in or out without permits
is punishable by death without reprieve.

142
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:47,791
All flames have been replaced by night
pearls. Even the stoves were extinguished!

143
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:50,124
All food and drinks came from outside...

144
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:53,333
The Empress has not eaten much.
She's probably still worried...

145
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,666
Your Majesty... Your Majesty.

146
00:15:06,667 --> 00:15:09,541
-I'm not hungry!
-The coronation is imminent.

147
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:13,333
Your Majesty should mind her health.
I've even ordered your favourite soup.

148
00:15:23,167 --> 00:15:28,833
You don't need to test everything anymore.
Leave that to your subordinates.

149
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:36,374
Your Majesty has saved my life.
I live and die for Your Majesty.

150
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:40,874
Remember...

151
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,749
you have to stay alive.

152
00:15:43,834 --> 00:15:46,791
Only then can you defeat your enemies.

153
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:51,874
Since l entered the palace at the age of 14,
l've lived through crises after crises.

154
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:55,583
Had I been careless,
I'd have been crushed,

155
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:02,624
and no woman would
ever ascend the throne.

156
00:16:05,042 --> 00:16:08,916
Your Majesty, dinner is safe to eat.

157
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:26,958
The lmperial Chaplain's Magic Deer is here.

158
00:16:40,084 --> 00:16:44,124
Everything is transient;
follow Heaven's Mandate.

159
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:47,124
Welcome, Chaplain.

160
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,708
-Everyone, on your knees!
-Yes, Your Majesty.

161
00:16:52,584 --> 00:16:54,916
The astronomical phenomena
have been chaotic.

162
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,916
An evil availed of my spiritual sabbatical
to disturb the royal soil against nature.

163
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,666
Would the Chaplain please enlighten me?

164
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:07,416
The evil has been committing crimes
as Venus has left the Palace for 8 years.

165
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,499
It has been locked up and has not returned.

166
00:17:10,584 --> 00:17:12,291
Locked up?

167
00:17:13,542 --> 00:17:16,749
Is Venus a prisoner?

168
00:17:16,834 --> 00:17:22,041
Venus originated
from Yang Qui of Dee City.

169
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:25,749
Left the Palace for 8 years?
Originated from Dee City?

170
00:17:25,834 --> 00:17:30,583
Does the Chaplain mean Detective Dee?

171
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:34,916
8 years ago, Dee opposed your regency
and was jailed for treason.

172
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,083
If we release him, the dissenters
will become more recalcitrant!

173
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:41,541
Please think twice, Your Majesty.

174
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:49,874
As soon as Venus has returned, chaos
will end and all stars will be at peace.

175
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:54,666
Find out whether Dee is dead or alive.

176
00:18:07,292 --> 00:18:10,041
Welcome, Officer Shangguan.

177
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,166
LlAlSON OFFlCE

178
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,999
Dong Jin of Jiang Nan reported
that he wants to deploy

179
00:18:13,084 --> 00:18:17,166
6,000 soldiers to suppress the barbarians.
Memorial to be transferred to Military Dept.

180
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,083
The Chief of Jiang Nan also reported that
the river flooding

181
00:18:19,167 --> 00:18:20,458
will kill and ruin the paddies.

182
00:18:20,542 --> 00:18:22,916
Memorial to be transferred
to Public Works Dept.

183
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:30,124
The South has been such a mess lately.
After the flood came the plague.

184
00:18:33,042 --> 00:18:36,624
Here come the memorials to the throne.

185
00:18:36,709 --> 00:18:38,499
Hurry up and burn the memorials.

186
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:41,791
Stop nagging like a girl. Get to work!

187
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,958
Memorials are prescriptions for the state.

188
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:49,291
We know the state's illness
by reading them.

189
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:53,499
But the memorials in recent years show
that the people's livelihood has improved

190
00:18:53,584 --> 00:18:56,374
and they are living in contentment.

191
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:00,541
So what?

192
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,874
You really think you can get out of here?

193
00:19:04,417 --> 00:19:08,874
-Ling.
-Yes.

194
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:15,124
-Perhaps it's time I left here.
-What are you talking about?

195
00:19:24,167 --> 00:19:27,041
Oh! I hear that! Quite a few men...

196
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:34,291
You said if you were to leave here alive,
you might have to fight a big battle.

197
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:37,749
A battle of life and death.
Remember what I taught you?

198
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:38,916
Got it!

199
00:20:22,417 --> 00:20:24,541
Push the cart!

200
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:53,499
20cm to the left!

201
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,916
1cm below!

202
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:59,166
Do it again!

203
00:21:24,542 --> 00:21:25,999
Kill the assassins!

204
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:29,499
Hurry! Hurry up!
Kill the assassins!

205
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,583
-Protect Her Excellency!
-Get lost!

206
00:21:36,292 --> 00:21:37,958
Watch out! Someone's on the roof!

207
00:21:38,042 --> 00:21:40,874
Hidden archers! Get down!

208
00:21:42,709 --> 00:21:45,833
No, they are going to jump!

209
00:21:45,917 --> 00:21:50,499
-Don't let the assassins escape!
-Take them alive!

210
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,916
-They are all dead.
-You follow me up!

211
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,749
-Don't let anyone escape, dead or alive!
-Yes Sir!

212
00:22:11,084 --> 00:22:14,291
-You! Go after the archers on the roof!
-Yes Sir!

213
00:22:19,167 --> 00:22:20,416
No need to give chase.

214
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,999
This is a maximum security prison,
and yet they can come and go at ease.

215
00:22:24,084 --> 00:22:26,458
They must be aided by someone inside.

216
00:22:27,209 --> 00:22:29,374
Nonsense!

217
00:22:29,459 --> 00:22:31,583
How can the killers be our men?

218
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:35,583
The killers from outside
must know someone from inside.

219
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:38,666
These people are too powerful for you.

220
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:41,208
Perhaps not for her.

221
00:22:41,292 --> 00:22:44,833
This official is elegantly dressed
with an impressing bearing.

222
00:22:44,917 --> 00:22:49,541
It doesn't look like you're from here.
I bet you're from the Palace.

223
00:22:55,334 --> 00:22:56,374
No need.

224
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:01,249
He's really blind.

225
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:04,624
Why did you feign blindness?

226
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:08,416
The world is marked by misfortunes.

227
00:23:09,417 --> 00:23:13,708
I tried to stay away but failed after all.

228
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:18,083
If I'm blind like him I can be at peace.

229
00:23:18,167 --> 00:23:20,124
Your prediction was correct.

230
00:23:20,209 --> 00:23:23,999
You said the day that trouble found you
would be the day you could leave jail.

231
00:23:24,084 --> 00:23:26,166
It's a pity we can't leave together.

232
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:33,166
I have nothing to do with the world outside.
But you never managed to extricate yourself.

233
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,833
Thanks for keeping me company
all this time.

234
00:23:35,917 --> 00:23:38,999
We are beyond such formality.

235
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:45,499
Perhaps you'll discover that being outside
is not as free as being inside.

236
00:23:47,584 --> 00:23:50,624
You think I'm right?

237
00:24:09,084 --> 00:24:13,833
Military examination in the year 689!

238
00:24:13,917 --> 00:24:19,624
On the right is Chen from Xiangzhou.
His weapon will be the iron rod.

239
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:25,749
On the left is Yen from Yangzhou.
His weapon will be the meteor hammer.

240
00:24:25,834 --> 00:24:30,083
The tournament begins!

241
00:24:47,209 --> 00:24:50,166
Your Majesty, Dee has been brought here.

242
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:54,333
You knew you were coming to see me,
but you're still in prison clothes

243
00:24:54,417 --> 00:24:56,374
and you didn't even shave?

244
00:24:56,459 --> 00:25:00,083
Years ago when I opposed your regency,
I had already been accused of treason.

245
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:04,124
Now that your coronation is imminent,
even if I got out of these prison clothes,

246
00:25:04,209 --> 00:25:06,666
I might have to put them on again soon.
So I decided not to change.

247
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,958
Leave us alone.

248
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:16,166
-You too, Jing'er.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

249
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:35,999
The Crown Prince was very little then.
I helped him rule as an Empress Dowager.

250
00:25:36,084 --> 00:25:39,499
What was wrong with that?
And yet you had to oppose me.

251
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,416
During my rule for the last 8 years,
the state has not been corrupt

252
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,208
and the people are rich.

253
00:25:45,292 --> 00:25:49,249
Even the Prince begged me
in writing to ascend the throne.

254
00:25:49,334 --> 00:25:53,624
-What more can you say?
-Nothing.

255
00:25:55,292 --> 00:25:57,583
You men are just not used
to women in power.

256
00:25:57,667 --> 00:26:02,666
One can't be conservative in state matters
but has to reform constantly.

257
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:07,791
Reform is good, but all new things
will become old one day.

258
00:26:08,292 --> 00:26:10,541
While the old are being replaced
by the new,

259
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:13,624
if that involves their lives as well,
then rebellions become inevitable.

260
00:26:13,709 --> 00:26:15,958
Not only men... even dogs will try to flee.

261
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:29,166
Detective Dee is still Detective Dee.

262
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,208
Your words are so hurtful to the ears.

263
00:26:37,292 --> 00:26:41,124
That was your badge.

264
00:26:41,209 --> 00:26:43,458
I'm returning it to you.

265
00:26:43,542 --> 00:26:46,874
You shall be my Imperial Commissioner
in charge of the Phantom Flame Case.

266
00:26:46,959 --> 00:26:49,791
You shall work with the Supreme Court

267
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:53,791
to crack the case before my coronation!

268
00:27:17,917 --> 00:27:20,916
Why do you keep following me?

269
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,833
Her Majesty knows you've suffered in jail
and specifically ordered me to serve you.

270
00:27:26,917 --> 00:27:32,708
You have such a murderous look.
It will be a pain to be served by you!

271
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:42,541
It's so lively here.
There are more people inside the inn.

272
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:45,541
The Prince of Lanya is having a banquet.

273
00:27:45,542 --> 00:27:48,583
Li Xiao commands an army of 100,000
and is haughty because of his royal status.

274
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:52,291
He is at loggerheads with the Empress
and has long intended to revolt.

275
00:27:52,375 --> 00:27:56,541
He must be involved in this case.
You had better check him out.

276
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:59,583
Having the intention to revolt
doesn't mean he's involved in this case.

277
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:01,958
You better get it right.

278
00:28:07,084 --> 00:28:11,958
These were your clothes
before you were jailed.

279
00:28:12,042 --> 00:28:15,624
Only my Dragon Taming Mace is missing.

280
00:28:15,709 --> 00:28:17,708
It's getting late.

281
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:21,874
Do you want to stay here with me?

282
00:28:26,042 --> 00:28:30,291
Have you forgotten?
Her Majesty has ordered me to serve you.

283
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:37,499
To serve me?

284
00:28:55,334 --> 00:28:58,041
What are you standing there for?
Get me some water.

285
00:28:58,125 --> 00:28:59,791
I need to shave.

286
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:06,708
You call this service?

287
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,999
Look at you! Neither male nor a...

288
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,833
That's how you serve people?

289
00:29:14,667 --> 00:29:16,041
That's how I serve you!

290
00:29:37,792 --> 00:29:41,583
I've given you the blade.

291
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:44,374
Come, shave me.

292
00:29:50,792 --> 00:29:55,916
The Empress asked you to serve me,
but don't take it at face value.

293
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,958
She wants you to spy on me
but also to test you.

294
00:30:00,042 --> 00:30:05,916
I'll report every word to Her Majesty.

295
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,333
All right, let me tell you this.
She does not trust anyone.

296
00:30:10,334 --> 00:30:12,874
If we really work together,

297
00:30:12,959 --> 00:30:20,041
her intense suspicion
will turn her against you.

298
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:24,458
Why have you stopped shaving?
My beard is not there...

299
00:30:24,542 --> 00:30:26,416
It's here.

300
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:37,291
I suggest you tell her we can't get along.
That will set her mind at ease.

301
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:43,458
Let me see if she is what you said she is.

302
00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:02,749
Don't make it difficult for yourself.
If you don't want it, don't force yourself.

303
00:31:06,042 --> 00:31:07,291
But do you want it?

304
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:49,499
-Why didn't you tell me sooner?
-I gave you the whip. You still didn't get it?

305
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:41,041
Don't touch me.

306
00:33:14,709 --> 00:33:17,708
There are Assassins!

307
00:33:17,792 --> 00:33:21,166
Go and hide!

308
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:25,249
I've been waiting for you, Brother Dee.

309
00:33:25,334 --> 00:33:28,249
Why aren't you on your knees?

310
00:33:28,334 --> 00:33:31,499
I'm chasing suspects.
There is no time for formality.

311
00:33:31,584 --> 00:33:34,499
What suspects are you chasing?

312
00:33:34,584 --> 00:33:38,958
The Phantom Flame was staged by the
Chaplain under the order of the Empress!

313
00:33:39,042 --> 00:33:43,916
She wants to usurp the throne
and eliminate old officials like us.

314
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,749
I'm occupied. See you later!

315
00:33:46,834 --> 00:33:50,458
Dee, receive the Military Tally!

316
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:54,958
With this tally, you can deploy any troops.

317
00:33:55,042 --> 00:34:00,041
In view of your loyal nature,
I'm inviting you to join my Army of Justice.

318
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:03,583
I'm in command of 100,000 soldiers
and have a fail-proof plan

319
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:07,791
to overturn the evil Empress!

320
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:10,291
-Assassins!
-Protect the Duke!

321
00:34:14,334 --> 00:34:17,874
That's outrageous, Li Xiao!
How dare you rave like that?

322
00:34:20,834 --> 00:34:25,041
I won't talk with you now that she's here.

323
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:29,249
But remember, one of these days

324
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:33,208
you'll grovel before me

325
00:34:33,292 --> 00:34:35,916
and take my orders.

326
00:34:37,125 --> 00:34:38,291
Remember!

327
00:34:38,834 --> 00:34:43,583
-Grovel before me and take my orders.
-He's hopeless. Let's go.

328
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:45,958
You'll ruin your integrity!

329
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:53,083
He must have ordered the attack just now.

330
00:34:53,167 --> 00:34:55,499
Why kill me if he wants to buy me off?

331
00:34:56,542 --> 00:34:58,624
He wants you dead
because he can't buy you off.

332
00:34:58,709 --> 00:35:00,666
No.

333
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:10,749
He doesn't want me dead.
It's someone else who does.

334
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,583
The Empress hereby decrees:

335
00:35:17,209 --> 00:35:20,041
Mysterious cases are rampant lately.

336
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:23,249
These are the work of villains
who are spreading fallacies to cheat people.

337
00:35:23,334 --> 00:35:27,083
I hereby appoint Dee as Imperial
Commissioner to lead the Supreme Court

338
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:31,708
to solve the Phantom Flame Case
before my Coronation.

339
00:35:31,792 --> 00:35:32,958
I humbly receive the Imperial Edict.

340
00:35:34,584 --> 00:35:38,166
Commissioner, you do have a unique style.

341
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:40,374
You bring your bird out while on duty?

342
00:35:40,459 --> 00:35:44,374
Don't underestimate it. It can solve crimes.

343
00:35:46,625 --> 00:35:48,874
Where's the sun so early in the morning?

344
00:35:53,334 --> 00:35:57,583
This is the mortuary. This way, please.

345
00:36:05,167 --> 00:36:09,166
The bird is afraid to go in.
Find someone outside to take care of it.

346
00:36:21,167 --> 00:36:25,749
The deceased was Jia of the 4th rank,

347
00:36:25,834 --> 00:36:28,499
Vice Minister of Public Works.

348
00:36:28,584 --> 00:36:31,833
On the 17th day of the 8th month,
at 5pm,

349
00:36:31,917 --> 00:36:36,083
he burnt to ashes inside the Buddha.

350
00:36:38,042 --> 00:36:40,041
What do you think of this case?

351
00:36:47,292 --> 00:36:50,333
Go watch over the evidence outside.

352
00:36:52,542 --> 00:36:55,166
I was ordered to follow you closely.

353
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:57,624
You want to return
this badge to the Empress?

354
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:08,791
Don't touch the evidence or get too close!

355
00:37:08,875 --> 00:37:11,166
Shut the door!

356
00:37:24,084 --> 00:37:26,958
Keep reading.

357
00:37:27,042 --> 00:37:32,458
-The deceased was Xue of the 3rd rank...
-Louder!

358
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,583
The deceased was Xue...

359
00:37:44,792 --> 00:37:46,749
You can speak now.

360
00:37:52,417 --> 00:37:54,374
The murder technique is not human.

361
00:37:54,459 --> 00:37:58,499
Cut the generality. Get to the point.
Who do you think it is?

362
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:08,291
Rumour has it that the Chaplain Lu Li
is on a murder spree before the Coronation.

363
00:38:18,417 --> 00:38:23,333
To set an example and warn
the dissenters not to act rashly.

364
00:38:23,417 --> 00:38:26,374
Jia was sent by the Empress.
Why kill him?

365
00:38:26,459 --> 00:38:30,041
She's unfathomable.

366
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:31,958
I read Jia's memorials before.

367
00:38:32,042 --> 00:38:35,333
He inspected the Buddha every month.
The time-table for the Buddha is very tight.

368
00:38:35,417 --> 00:38:37,749
Wouldn't killing him hinder the Coronation?

369
00:38:40,375 --> 00:38:44,791
You read Master Jia's memorials?

370
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:49,749
I read memorials at the Liaison Office
before they were burnt every day.

371
00:38:53,584 --> 00:38:55,958
Moving the amulet
causes divine intervention.

372
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:58,749
The Chaplain is killing with black magic.

373
00:38:58,834 --> 00:39:01,624
-You believe all this nonsense?
-It's evident. Why can't I believe it?

374
00:39:01,709 --> 00:39:03,833
You're lying.

375
00:39:03,917 --> 00:39:07,916
We both know the amulets are just a front.

376
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,208
The murderer is trying to hide the truth.

377
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:18,333
She's still spying on us.

378
00:39:18,417 --> 00:39:20,583
Let's play her.

379
00:39:27,459 --> 00:39:32,041
According to your theory,
you'll be promoted now that Xue has died.

380
00:39:32,125 --> 00:39:34,666
That makes you a suspect as well.

381
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:41,416
Then why do you think I killed Master Jia?

382
00:39:43,459 --> 00:39:45,458
You killed Master Jia as a diversion.

383
00:39:45,542 --> 00:39:49,499
Your real target was your superior.
That fits your hypothesis perfectly.

384
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:56,208
Perhaps your real goal
is to thwart the Coronation.

385
00:39:59,834 --> 00:40:02,916
-Don't stop.
-I'm done...

386
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,666
Start again till I ask you to stop.

387
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,541
Twice already. There's nothing to read!

388
00:40:14,875 --> 00:40:18,166
The deceased Detective Dee
is fighting with Minister Pei.

389
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:23,333
-You're framing me!
-Didn't you ask us to play her?

390
00:40:25,709 --> 00:40:30,458
I was acting. Couldn't you tell?

391
00:40:39,625 --> 00:40:41,458
Sir! The birdcage is on fire, Master Pei!

392
00:40:42,209 --> 00:40:45,833
-Sir! Sir!
-What's the matter?

393
00:40:45,917 --> 00:40:47,624
I don't know.

394
00:40:49,792 --> 00:40:50,791
Detective Dee!

395
00:40:50,875 --> 00:40:56,166
Your evidence is aflame like those officials.

396
00:40:56,167 --> 00:40:57,416
Let's go to the kitchen.

397
00:41:03,834 --> 00:41:07,333
-What's for lunch?
-Stir-fried cucumbers with snow lotus.

398
00:41:07,417 --> 00:41:09,541
-Any chicken blood?
-Over there.

399
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:11,166
What's he doing?

400
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:14,708
He probably found out
why the victims caught fire.

401
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,499
Master Xue caught fire at 5pm
when the sun descended towards the west.

402
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,291
The Buddha was surrounded by shadows.

403
00:41:46,375 --> 00:41:49,041
But once he was on the parade ground,
he started catching fire,

404
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:51,791
because the parade ground was uncovered.

405
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,541
So I infer that the sun triggers the poison!

406
00:42:04,334 --> 00:42:07,374
Let's stay away from this.

407
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:53,374
Watch out.

408
00:43:14,417 --> 00:43:17,041
Detective Dee!

409
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:20,874
Fancy seeing you again before I die!

410
00:43:21,792 --> 00:43:26,749
That's Fate.
We're kept alive for a purpose.

411
00:43:33,417 --> 00:43:36,083
You're back in the Supreme Court?

412
00:43:39,375 --> 00:43:42,666
The Empress put me in charge
of the Phantom Flame Case.

413
00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:47,499
Dee's position is unclear.
We can't let him dupe us.

414
00:43:47,584 --> 00:43:52,458
-Let's join forces and watch over him.
-Join forces?

415
00:43:52,542 --> 00:43:55,749
I work directly under the Empress.
It's not up to you to make suggestions.

416
00:44:17,042 --> 00:44:18,333
What's the matter?

417
00:44:19,417 --> 00:44:22,416
Before the accidents,

418
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:28,124
both officials did one thing
besides moving the amulets.

419
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:32,541
-What was it?
-Drinking water.

420
00:44:32,625 --> 00:44:36,208
They both drank the water here

421
00:44:36,292 --> 00:44:43,249
and they were killed
by intaking that liquid poison.

422
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,833
But that can't be!

423
00:44:47,542 --> 00:44:49,208
I was supposed to move the amulet first.

424
00:44:49,292 --> 00:44:51,624
Master Xue just happened
to do it before me.

425
00:44:51,709 --> 00:44:56,791
If the murderer killed because of the amulet,
how did he know Master Xue

426
00:44:56,875 --> 00:44:59,333
would snatch it
and poison his water beforehand?

427
00:44:59,417 --> 00:45:02,666
It should have nothing to do with the water.

428
00:45:04,209 --> 00:45:08,166
You work directly under the Empress.

429
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:11,541
Do you need to hear my humble opinion?

430
00:45:15,167 --> 00:45:17,666
After I was in jail,
I kept professing my loyalty in writing.

431
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:20,749
Eventually the Empress pardoned me.

432
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:24,874
I joined the Department of Public Works,
in charge of repairing royal palaces.

433
00:45:26,084 --> 00:45:29,999
I was then made supervisor of the Buddha.

434
00:45:30,084 --> 00:45:33,249
In other words, I've been promoted.

435
00:45:36,625 --> 00:45:38,499
How magnificent!

436
00:45:38,584 --> 00:45:41,708
The Tubular Pillar in the Book of Fanyanna?

437
00:45:41,792 --> 00:45:47,416
Yes, I was inspired
by the Fanyanna Buddha.

438
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:51,291
The pillar's base is 100 feet underground.

439
00:45:51,375 --> 00:45:55,208
It can withstand earthquakes
and hurricanes.

440
00:45:58,125 --> 00:46:01,374
This is the top level of the Buddha.

441
00:46:01,375 --> 00:46:05,499
Master Jia died inside the Buddha's left eye.

442
00:46:14,292 --> 00:46:16,083
You have also been re-enacting the case?

443
00:46:19,917 --> 00:46:24,291
After working under you for so many years,
I'm used to doing case re-enactments.

444
00:46:25,959 --> 00:46:27,124
So what have you learnt?

445
00:46:29,584 --> 00:46:31,083
Fire beetles...

446
00:46:32,167 --> 00:46:33,999
What are fire beetles?

447
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,541
You also read the Book of Fanyanna.

448
00:46:37,625 --> 00:46:41,416
Remember the section on fire beetles?

449
00:46:41,792 --> 00:46:43,124
What?

450
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:48,416
The most venomous beetles
in Western Regions.

451
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,791
They feed on yellow phosphorus
and their bodies catch fire under the sun.

452
00:46:52,792 --> 00:46:56,041
So the beetles are related
to the two deaths?

453
00:46:56,125 --> 00:47:02,458
I witnessed what happened that day.
Only later did I think of the fire beetles.

454
00:47:02,917 --> 00:47:05,749
Stop it, Donglai!

455
00:47:07,709 --> 00:47:13,708
You knew about this all along.
Why did you rant about divine intervention?

456
00:47:13,792 --> 00:47:18,999
As a menial,
I use my wit when threatened.

457
00:47:19,667 --> 00:47:22,291
To be honest, even if I'd told you my theory,

458
00:47:22,375 --> 00:47:26,874
given your wisdom, you wouldn't believe it.

459
00:47:27,584 --> 00:47:28,958
You son of a bitch!

460
00:47:29,042 --> 00:47:33,708
Calm down. I've known him for years.
That's how he is.

461
00:47:38,417 --> 00:47:41,874
Come!
Detain him for extreme torture later.

462
00:47:41,959 --> 00:47:43,624
-Yes Sir.
-Stop!

463
00:47:45,959 --> 00:47:50,374
Donglai. The Empress has asked me
to lead the case.

464
00:47:50,459 --> 00:47:54,833
I can decide everything without intervention.
All of you stand down!

465
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,624
What else do you know? Spit it out!

466
00:48:00,917 --> 00:48:05,208
I'm only speculating.
After all, fire beetles are not indigenous.

467
00:48:05,292 --> 00:48:09,208
For more details we need help.

468
00:48:10,209 --> 00:48:11,583
The Phantom Bazaar.

469
00:48:13,917 --> 00:48:15,416
What is the Phantom Bazaar?

470
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:21,833
It's a spooky pandemonium.

471
00:48:21,917 --> 00:48:25,833
High officials like you would never go there.

472
00:48:27,084 --> 00:48:32,833
Shatuo, do you still remember
Donkey Wang?

473
00:48:35,084 --> 00:48:39,749
Luoyang City was built
a thousand years ago.

474
00:48:39,834 --> 00:48:42,416
The old city subsided
during the Han Dynasty.

475
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:45,416
A new city was built on top
during the Sui Dynasty.

476
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:49,083
The old city underground
became a black market.

477
00:48:49,084 --> 00:48:51,666
They call it the Phantom Bazaar.

478
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:17,624
Who rang for a boat?

479
00:49:17,709 --> 00:49:20,333
We rang for a boat
to take us to Dr Donkey Wang.

480
00:49:20,417 --> 00:49:24,041
-You know the place?
-Wang the Donkey with Scabies?

481
00:49:24,125 --> 00:49:29,124
Five silver coins. Non refundable!

482
00:50:10,334 --> 00:50:13,791
Anybody here? Is anybody here?

483
00:50:27,834 --> 00:50:29,374
Hey!

484
00:50:31,875 --> 00:50:33,583
You're still alive, Detective Dee?

485
00:50:33,667 --> 00:50:36,791
Scram! This is no place for official curs!

486
00:50:36,875 --> 00:50:38,791
I'm here to save you.

487
00:50:38,875 --> 00:50:45,374
Save me? No, I'm fine!
I don't want trouble!

488
00:50:49,667 --> 00:50:55,208
Now that I'm here
your good days are over.

489
00:50:55,292 --> 00:50:59,583
True. You always bring me troubles.

490
00:50:59,667 --> 00:51:05,041
-I'm really so sorry.
-If you don't go, I'll go.

491
00:51:06,459 --> 00:51:08,791
I'll move house.

492
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:15,958
Pei! Give me the money!

493
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:30,166
-What do you want to know?
-Ever heard of fire beetles?

494
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:41,999
-Fire beetles? This creature...
-It has been reported that they're extinct.

495
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,958
-I have no idea.
-Could it be they exist in Central Plains?

496
00:51:45,042 --> 00:51:46,166
It's no use.

497
00:51:51,584 --> 00:51:55,708
You won't solve this case! Pay up!

498
00:51:55,792 --> 00:51:59,791
Don't worry. Tell us first and I'll pay.

499
00:51:59,875 --> 00:52:02,708
I'll only tell you after you've paid.

500
00:52:02,792 --> 00:52:04,083
What is it?

501
00:52:05,292 --> 00:52:09,083
I'll pay after you've told us.

502
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:11,958
I'll only speak after you've paid.

503
00:52:16,959 --> 00:52:17,999
Look out!

504
00:52:40,084 --> 00:52:41,749
There's somebody above!

505
00:52:46,417 --> 00:52:49,833
-Hey, where's Detective Dee?
-He's chasing Dr Wang!

506
00:54:46,084 --> 00:54:49,458
-It's the Imperial Chaplain!
-Impossible!

507
00:55:10,125 --> 00:55:13,583
Split! Can't you split? Split!

508
00:55:49,375 --> 00:55:52,916
Come on... Get in there.

509
00:57:29,709 --> 00:57:31,624
Jing'er is in trouble! I'll help her!

510
00:57:54,084 --> 00:57:57,458
Donglai! Jing'er! Move!

511
00:58:13,792 --> 00:58:17,374
Who is he?
Why does the Chaplain want to kill him?

512
00:58:17,459 --> 00:58:19,833
-He's not the Chaplain!
-How can you be so sure?

513
00:58:19,917 --> 00:58:22,374
I've seen the Chaplain! I'm positive he is...

514
00:58:29,209 --> 00:58:31,541
Hey! The Chaplain is over there!

515
00:58:33,875 --> 00:58:35,249
It's him again!

516
00:58:43,042 --> 00:58:45,749
Donglai! Jing'er!
It's a diversion.

517
00:58:47,792 --> 00:58:48,874
But Jing'er is by herself...

518
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:51,416
She wants to find out his identity
more than we do.

519
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:55,541
Their target is Wang.
We need to protect him.

520
00:58:56,834 --> 00:59:00,124
Jing'er knows where to find us.
Stop wasting time and follow me!

521
01:00:37,875 --> 01:00:38,916
Jing'er?

522
01:01:40,959 --> 01:01:45,374
Almighty infinity? Infinity Monastery?

523
01:02:04,917 --> 01:02:06,999
There's nobody here. Stop pretending.

524
01:02:09,042 --> 01:02:10,083
Take your pins out.

525
01:02:12,834 --> 01:02:17,541
I was fine down there.
Why drag me up here?

526
01:02:17,625 --> 01:02:21,041
Speak up! Where can we find fire beetles?

527
01:02:21,125 --> 01:02:23,541
If I can crack this case,
I'll help you get back to the Palace.

528
01:02:23,625 --> 01:02:26,083
To hell with it! Who wants to go back?

529
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:41,708
I advise you not to take up this case!
You can't mess with the people behind it.

530
01:02:41,792 --> 01:02:46,041
It can't be done... and then... and then...

531
01:02:47,084 --> 01:02:52,958
Your transfiguration makes you inarticulate.
Let me see.

532
01:02:53,042 --> 01:02:57,208
Don't touch these two acupoints!

533
01:02:57,292 --> 01:03:01,416
They are anathema to transfiguration!

534
01:03:06,334 --> 01:03:08,041
Don't touch me!

535
01:03:08,125 --> 01:03:11,666
-What's the matter?
-Nothing. I thought of someone.

536
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:15,666
-Like you, she didn't let me touch her.
-Who?

537
01:03:19,459 --> 01:03:22,624
It's all right. It's Donglai.

538
01:03:37,417 --> 01:03:41,166
-Who is he?
-The Imperial Physician, Wang Bo.

539
01:03:42,542 --> 01:03:46,833
-Also known as Donkey Wang.
-He's Donkey Wang?

540
01:03:49,417 --> 01:03:52,041
Could that be the so-called transfiguration?

541
01:03:52,834 --> 01:03:55,333
Well, this is my first time seeing it.

542
01:03:55,334 --> 01:03:58,874
That's petty stuff. What's so special?

543
01:03:58,959 --> 01:04:04,249
We wasted our whole evening on him.
What's this piece of crap good for?

544
01:04:04,334 --> 01:04:06,708
Who is she? So arrogant!

545
01:04:06,792 --> 01:04:12,624
Officer Shangguan, the Empress's favourite.

546
01:04:12,709 --> 01:04:18,374
So you are Shangguan Jing'er?
You are the Empress's bitch?

547
01:04:30,167 --> 01:04:32,958
Let go of me!
We need to torture him to make him talk!

548
01:04:33,042 --> 01:04:36,624
A confession under torture is useless.

549
01:04:36,709 --> 01:04:41,583
Don't you know that it's torture
which alienates people from the Empress

550
01:04:41,667 --> 01:04:44,249
and makes them turn against her?

551
01:04:47,334 --> 01:04:52,999
The fire beetles you're looking for
were used for the late Emperor's asthenia.

552
01:04:53,084 --> 01:04:57,416
I heard about them from Western people

553
01:04:57,500 --> 01:05:00,791
and decided to use them to treat
his loss of strength and energy.

554
01:05:00,875 --> 01:05:02,708
I presented a memorial to the late Emperor.

555
01:05:02,792 --> 01:05:06,999
The late Emperor personally commanded
Western merchants

556
01:05:07,084 --> 01:05:09,166
to present him 20 of them.

557
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:13,166
We soon discovered that
they had no medical value.

558
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:15,958
In fact, they were a very lethal poison.

559
01:05:16,042 --> 01:05:20,291
Once ingested,
one would burn under the sun.

560
01:05:20,375 --> 01:05:21,874
That's the symptom
of the Phantom Flame Case!

561
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:26,874
After this failure I fled for my life.

562
01:05:26,959 --> 01:05:32,416
Before I fled, I exposed them under the sun,
hoping they would be exterminated.

563
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:36,624
But in my rush, I'm not sure if they died out.

564
01:05:36,709 --> 01:05:43,166
-So where did you keep the fire beetles?
-It's where Infinity Monastery is now.

565
01:05:43,667 --> 01:05:47,749
You try to harm Infinity Monastery
and the Chaplain. Let me kill him now.

566
01:05:47,834 --> 01:05:52,791
Jing'er, the Chaplain can help his case.

567
01:05:52,875 --> 01:05:57,958
-Can you tell him I want to talk to him?
-What about?

568
01:05:59,167 --> 01:06:02,708
I want to know why the Chaplain wants me
to handle the case.

569
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:06,583
The Chaplain is so powerful.
Couldn't he just tell me who did it?

570
01:06:08,834 --> 01:06:11,666
The Chaplain is on spiritual sabbatical.

571
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:17,874
-Then I'll go to the Monastery to find him.
-Detective Dee, you can't just go there.

572
01:06:17,959 --> 01:06:23,166
I know, without the Imperial Edict,
trespassers are punishable by death.

573
01:06:23,875 --> 01:06:31,583
Please tell the Chaplain I must see him,
whether he wants to or not.

574
01:06:40,375 --> 01:06:42,499
You are unsure.

575
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,458
Apparently, Dee is at the end of his tether.

576
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:02,291
There's no need to see him anymore.
I'll handle it.

577
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:11,624
Remember! To achieve greatness,
everyone is expendable!

578
01:07:11,709 --> 01:07:16,208
One needs to be committed absolutely.

579
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:34,541
If fire beetles are found in the Monastery,
then the Chaplain has to be involved.

580
01:07:34,625 --> 01:07:38,041
But what's the Chaplain's
motive for murder?

581
01:07:38,125 --> 01:07:41,291
Both men moved
the amulets before they died.

582
01:07:41,375 --> 01:07:47,374
I don't believe in divine intervention, but
there might be a clue behind the amulets.

583
01:07:47,459 --> 01:07:50,458
Xue moved it during the investigation.

584
01:07:50,542 --> 01:07:53,624
Jia moved them
while inspecting the tubular pillar.

585
01:07:53,709 --> 01:07:58,041
I think during his inspection,
Jia must have found something.

586
01:07:58,125 --> 01:08:01,999
The clue may be in Jia's inspection report.

587
01:08:02,084 --> 01:08:05,166
We have to find this report.

588
01:08:05,250 --> 01:08:07,416
I'll go to Jia's residence tonight.

589
01:08:23,875 --> 01:08:26,083
Pei of the Supreme Court
welcomes the Prince!

590
01:08:34,417 --> 01:08:38,624
Detective Dee, receive the mace.

591
01:08:57,625 --> 01:09:00,874
The late Emperor gave you this weapon.

592
01:09:00,959 --> 01:09:03,958
It was confiscated when you were in jail.

593
01:09:04,042 --> 01:09:07,124
After I got hold of it, I kept it for you!

594
01:09:09,209 --> 01:09:14,291
Dee, I'm bestowing this mace on you.

595
01:09:14,375 --> 01:09:17,083
If I make mistakes in my rule in the future,

596
01:09:17,167 --> 01:09:21,624
you should advise me
frankly with this mace.

597
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:29,541
The Empress has spies everywhere.

598
01:09:29,625 --> 01:09:33,208
You are returning the mace to me in public.

599
01:09:33,292 --> 01:09:36,624
You want the Empress to suspect me?

600
01:09:36,709 --> 01:09:40,083
I have an agreement with the Empress.

601
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,583
I only care about the investigation.
The power struggle is none of my concern.

602
01:09:48,209 --> 01:09:55,208
The bitch was right to put you in jail.
You've become a different person.

603
01:09:55,292 --> 01:09:59,499
Dee, do you know
how the late Emperor died?

604
01:10:04,834 --> 01:10:09,916
The Empress ordered
the Chaplain to kill him!

605
01:10:19,334 --> 01:10:22,124
Detective Dee!

606
01:10:23,834 --> 01:10:26,416
Get up! Detective Dee!

607
01:10:27,375 --> 01:10:28,958
I've won!

608
01:10:30,959 --> 01:10:33,124
Your Highness, you've won this time!

609
01:10:33,209 --> 01:10:35,374
No matter how good Dee is,
he can't beat you!

610
01:10:35,459 --> 01:10:38,166
He kneeled before you after all.

611
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:40,374
Detective Dee has a talent.

612
01:10:40,459 --> 01:10:43,499
Instead of crushing him,
we can win him over.

613
01:10:43,584 --> 01:10:47,749
But some people believe
he's a threat to our plan

614
01:10:47,834 --> 01:10:51,041
and must be eliminated.

615
01:10:51,125 --> 01:10:55,333
Nonsense! So short-sighted!

616
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:58,624
Who needs force to subdue Detective Dee?

617
01:10:58,709 --> 01:11:03,166
To win without fighting, what do you need?

618
01:11:03,250 --> 01:11:05,416
-Here!
-Yes, you are right.

619
01:11:12,084 --> 01:11:14,416
Assassins!

620
01:11:15,584 --> 01:11:17,166
What's wrong with his body?

621
01:11:19,959 --> 01:11:21,958
-Look!
-The Prince...

622
01:12:09,375 --> 01:12:15,999
Since you're here, why not have a drink?

623
01:12:34,375 --> 01:12:37,833
That is the mace
the late Emperor gave you?

624
01:12:37,917 --> 01:12:39,624
What's so special about it?

625
01:12:39,709 --> 01:12:43,708
-It can detect the crack in a weapon.
-How?

626
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:47,791
By hitting the enemy's weapon
with this mace, you can hear the crack.

627
01:12:51,375 --> 01:12:55,249
When you strike it, it will break!
Break!

628
01:13:12,125 --> 01:13:17,541
Men have weak points like weapons.
They will also break when struck.

629
01:13:19,542 --> 01:13:25,499
Dee, this is your last chance!

630
01:13:25,584 --> 01:13:30,249
Your Majesty, please answer me
facing this mace.

631
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:34,874
How did the late Emperor die?

632
01:13:46,792 --> 01:13:49,291
You still suspect me after all?

633
01:13:49,375 --> 01:13:53,249
As reported, he died of liver disease.

634
01:13:53,334 --> 01:13:58,458
Contrary to rumours, I didn't poison him!

635
01:13:58,542 --> 01:14:01,083
I'm ascending the throne
on Heaven's Mandate.

636
01:14:01,167 --> 01:14:05,249
But since I'm a woman, I'm being vilified.

637
01:14:11,917 --> 01:14:15,124
You know why I came to see you?

638
01:14:15,125 --> 01:14:17,374
To dissuade me
from going to the Monastery.

639
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:24,416
The Monastery is the Chaplain's retreat.
Nobody has ever dared to disturb it.

640
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:28,541
The murderer is trying
to misguide you and hurt our relationship.

641
01:14:28,625 --> 01:14:31,374
I order you not to investigate the Monastery!

642
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,791
The Chaplain is on spiritual sabbatical.

643
01:14:35,875 --> 01:14:41,291
After my coronation,
he will leave the palace.

644
01:14:41,375 --> 01:14:43,791
There's no need to visit him.

645
01:14:43,875 --> 01:14:46,874
Will the Chaplain vanish forever?

646
01:14:51,375 --> 01:14:54,541
Protect Her Majesty!

647
01:14:54,625 --> 01:14:57,458
Stop! Don't let him in!

648
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:00,666
I'm looking for Detective Dee.

649
01:15:05,792 --> 01:15:07,624
Protect the Empress!

650
01:15:16,542 --> 01:15:18,958
-Your Majesty!
-Spit it out!

651
01:15:19,042 --> 01:15:22,041
The Prince was killed at his residence.

652
01:15:27,334 --> 01:15:30,666
Detective Dee has fled!
That way! He's gone that way!

653
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:34,249
Go and arrest him.
The rest are to stay with the Empress.

654
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:58,374
Madame Jia, I know you're in mourning,
but our investigation is very urgent.

655
01:15:58,459 --> 01:16:01,374
My apologies for such a late visit.

656
01:16:03,459 --> 01:16:08,166
Two days after my husband's death,

657
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:11,791
a mysterious fire burnt down his study.

658
01:16:18,417 --> 01:16:21,749
Why didn't you report it?

659
01:16:21,834 --> 01:16:24,708
-Was I supposed to report it?
-Of course, the cause of fire is suspicious.

660
01:16:24,792 --> 01:16:29,499
Someone wants to destroy the evidence.
It's so important and you...

661
01:16:30,125 --> 01:16:32,499
Madame, Madame.

662
01:16:39,625 --> 01:16:43,124
Is your residence being renovated?

663
01:16:43,209 --> 01:16:47,416
It leaked earlier, so we're fixing the roof.

664
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:50,708
It's been going on for more than a month.

665
01:16:52,709 --> 01:16:55,458
More than a month?

666
01:16:55,542 --> 01:16:59,624
That means before Master Jia's accident,
the renovation had already begun.

667
01:16:59,709 --> 01:17:01,249
Correct.

668
01:17:02,375 --> 01:17:07,583
Such a big renovation for a leak!
So where did he work?

669
01:17:07,667 --> 01:17:10,291
He moved to the east wing to work.

670
01:17:10,375 --> 01:17:11,916
Show me the way.

671
01:19:14,084 --> 01:19:15,749
Don't move!

672
01:19:36,250 --> 01:19:38,541
Detective Dee!

673
01:19:38,625 --> 01:19:42,416
You know it's a capital crime to come here.

674
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:45,624
Why do you walk right into the trap?

675
01:19:45,709 --> 01:19:50,291
For saving me from jail,
I must thank you in person.

676
01:19:50,375 --> 01:19:52,291
But you are such a lofty personage.

677
01:19:52,375 --> 01:19:55,874
Why do you need to resort
to ventriloquism?

678
01:19:58,792 --> 01:20:02,208
Detective Dee!
You tried all means to see me.

679
01:20:02,292 --> 01:20:06,124
Here I am. Say what you have to say.

680
01:20:07,417 --> 01:20:10,249
I heard fire beetles were bred here.

681
01:20:10,334 --> 01:20:13,374
I must ascertain this for my investigation.

682
01:20:15,334 --> 01:20:17,916
Nonsense.
I've been in retreat here for years.

683
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,833
I've never seen any fire beetles.
Leave right away and I'll spare your life.

684
01:20:22,917 --> 01:20:25,999
My life or death is still undetermined.

685
01:20:26,084 --> 01:20:30,041
But Jing'er, your life is in real danger.

686
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:34,208
Am I right, Officer Shangguan?

687
01:20:36,584 --> 01:20:38,083
Under the Empress's instructions,

688
01:20:38,167 --> 01:20:41,583
you threw yourself into my arms
and tried to have sex with me.

689
01:20:41,667 --> 01:20:44,041
But you gave away the show unexpectedly.

690
01:20:44,125 --> 01:20:48,499
You wouldn't let me touch your acupoint.
That smacked of transfiguration.

691
01:20:48,584 --> 01:20:52,583
When I entered the Monasteryjust now,
you spoke for the deer with ventriloquism.

692
01:20:52,667 --> 01:20:58,458
Every time the deer appeared,
it's you who spoke for it, right, Jing'er?

693
01:20:58,542 --> 01:21:02,041
In the Phantom Bazaar, you knew right away
the Chaplain was a fake.

694
01:21:02,125 --> 01:21:05,791
Is it because you're the same person?

695
01:21:05,875 --> 01:21:12,041
The Chaplain is Jing'er. Jing'er is him.

696
01:21:12,125 --> 01:21:19,333
Jing'er, it's time to show your real face.

697
01:21:46,167 --> 01:21:50,624
In order to ascend the throne, the Empress
eliminated clansmen and old officials,

698
01:21:50,709 --> 01:21:52,583
blaming everything on the Chaplain.

699
01:21:52,667 --> 01:21:54,541
In order to shut people's mouths,

700
01:21:54,625 --> 01:21:56,583
she even brought me back
to solve the case,

701
01:21:56,584 --> 01:21:59,208
never expecting that I would suspect her.

702
01:21:59,292 --> 01:22:03,916
She told me the Chaplain would disappear
after her coronation.

703
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,333
That has been her way
of doing things all along.

704
01:22:07,417 --> 01:22:12,124
To achieve greatness,
everyone is expendable!

705
01:22:12,209 --> 01:22:16,874
Jing'er, you know too many of her secrets.

706
01:22:16,959 --> 01:22:20,124
Once the Chaplain's gone,
what about Jing'er?

707
01:23:32,125 --> 01:23:33,458
It's sleeping smoke.

708
01:26:08,209 --> 01:26:10,291
Break!

709
01:26:32,084 --> 01:26:38,208
Remember! To achieve greatness,
everyone is expendable!

710
01:27:24,084 --> 01:27:26,791
I told you not to come here but you did!

711
01:27:29,250 --> 01:27:32,583
Don't think I'll be grateful because you
stepped in front of the sword to save me.

712
01:27:32,667 --> 01:27:34,999
You smart ass!

713
01:28:03,667 --> 01:28:06,791
They should be snared!

714
01:28:06,875 --> 01:28:08,333
Where are they?

715
01:28:10,542 --> 01:28:11,708
They can't be far.

716
01:28:15,875 --> 01:28:17,708
Go find them!

717
01:28:35,250 --> 01:28:36,833
You're awake.

718
01:28:38,625 --> 01:28:42,041
It's good you woke up.

719
01:28:43,792 --> 01:28:45,374
Did I hurt you?

720
01:28:48,875 --> 01:28:54,499
Detective Dee, you're so pathetic.

721
01:28:54,584 --> 01:28:57,833
The world is so big, but you can't fit in.

722
01:28:58,834 --> 01:29:03,333
Everybody wants to kill you.

723
01:29:03,417 --> 01:29:08,541
The Empress also asked me to kill you,
but I cannot.

724
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:19,291
Can you take me back?

725
01:29:31,084 --> 01:29:32,999
Your theory is correct.

726
01:29:33,084 --> 01:29:38,041
The Empress set up lnfinity Monastery

727
01:29:38,125 --> 01:29:42,499
to use the Chaplain to eliminate dissenters.

728
01:29:42,584 --> 01:29:47,249
At that time, we did kill many people.

729
01:29:47,334 --> 01:29:51,833
But we didn't cause the Phantom Flame!

730
01:29:51,917 --> 01:29:57,291
The murderer will strike again.

731
01:29:57,375 --> 01:30:05,083
You have to help the Empress!
Find out who the real culprit is.

732
01:30:22,834 --> 01:30:25,291
Be gentle and careful.

733
01:30:27,084 --> 01:30:30,124
Call the Imperial Physician!
Hurry up!

734
01:30:30,125 --> 01:30:34,874
-Call the Imperial Physician immediately!
-Yes, Your Majesty.

735
01:30:35,959 --> 01:30:38,166
Leave us.

736
01:30:43,250 --> 01:30:50,208
-Can I ask you one question, Your Majesty?
-Go ahead.

737
01:30:52,375 --> 01:30:58,249
Have you ever loved one person in your life?

738
01:31:04,417 --> 01:31:10,541
Yes. But the price was too high.

739
01:31:16,625 --> 01:31:24,999
Was it worth it?

740
01:31:27,625 --> 01:31:29,833
It's worth it.

741
01:32:59,542 --> 01:33:00,916
Detective Dee!

742
01:33:12,250 --> 01:33:14,833
We don't have time.
No need to untie me.

743
01:33:14,917 --> 01:33:21,666
I know why Jia had to die.
I saw his inspection diagram.

744
01:33:46,917 --> 01:33:49,208
Rein buckle...

745
01:37:20,334 --> 01:37:22,458
-Let's start!
-Yes Sir!

746
01:37:52,042 --> 01:37:56,708
This is the inspection diagram
Pei found in Jia's residence.

747
01:37:57,375 --> 01:37:58,833
According to Jia's last report,

748
01:37:58,917 --> 01:38:03,916
the Tubular Pillar is different
from the original design.

749
01:38:05,542 --> 01:38:07,874
According to Jia's memorial
before his death,

750
01:38:07,959 --> 01:38:11,499
holes were found underneath
all of the amulets.

751
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:17,583
Although he did not know the reason,
he was murdered nonetheless.

752
01:38:23,459 --> 01:38:28,249
The Towering Buddha is 66 yards high,
overlooking the palace.

753
01:38:28,334 --> 01:38:31,291
It can fall right upon the coronation stage.

754
01:38:31,375 --> 01:38:34,749
The Coronation Ceremony
would be the perfect time.

755
01:38:48,709 --> 01:38:51,249
Xue's death was a diversion.

756
01:38:51,334 --> 01:38:56,374
You wanted to divert our attention,
linking the death to the amulets,

757
01:38:56,375 --> 01:38:59,749
blaming it all on the Imperial Chaplain.

758
01:39:01,084 --> 01:39:05,833
You also took advantage of our relationship,
pre-empting my every move.

759
01:39:05,917 --> 01:39:09,374
Be it to Donkey Wang or to the Monastery,

760
01:39:09,459 --> 01:39:12,333
you managed to set up
ambushes beforehand.

761
01:39:12,417 --> 01:39:16,458
And you killed Jing'er outside the
Monastery.

762
01:39:16,542 --> 01:39:20,124
What a thorough analysis!

763
01:39:20,209 --> 01:39:22,874
You're indeed the "Extraordinary Detective"!

764
01:39:29,292 --> 01:39:34,083
Six years ago, you were the supervisor
when the Monastery was under renovation.

765
01:39:34,167 --> 01:39:39,166
I discovered the remnants of the fire beetles
left by Donkey Wang.

766
01:39:39,250 --> 01:39:41,583
Donglai was right.

767
01:39:41,667 --> 01:39:45,624
The poison entered the body
through the water.

768
01:39:45,709 --> 01:39:50,833
Jia drank the water but Xue did not.

769
01:39:50,917 --> 01:39:55,208
After he snatched the amulet,
he didn't drink any water.

770
01:39:55,292 --> 01:39:58,083
So the poison must have come
from outside.

771
01:39:58,167 --> 01:40:01,958
The poison must have seeped
into his body.

772
01:40:07,292 --> 01:40:11,291
Incredible!

773
01:40:11,375 --> 01:40:16,333
Don't do it, brother!
It's harmful to the empire and the people.

774
01:40:16,417 --> 01:40:19,541
Don't continue to make mistakes.

775
01:40:19,625 --> 01:40:22,833
For the last eight years,

776
01:40:22,917 --> 01:40:27,166
I've only lived for one thing.

777
01:40:33,250 --> 01:40:37,958
She gave me this, I have to repay her!

778
01:41:16,250 --> 01:41:17,791
Release them!

779
01:42:40,542 --> 01:42:43,166
Tubular pillar...

780
01:42:45,042 --> 01:42:46,416
Molten metal...

781
01:43:30,959 --> 01:43:32,749
Break!

782
01:43:37,709 --> 01:43:43,291
8 years ago, you led a revolt against her.
Now you're giving your life for her.

783
01:43:43,375 --> 01:43:45,541
Where's your integrity?

784
01:43:45,625 --> 01:43:50,249
She might be evil,
but you'll be killing more than her.

785
01:43:50,334 --> 01:43:52,124
What kind of monster have you become?

786
01:44:01,250 --> 01:44:04,374
-Release the molten metal!
-Yes!

787
01:44:08,709 --> 01:44:11,124
The die is cast.

788
01:44:11,209 --> 01:44:14,291
The molten metal will run into
the tubular pillar and melt its base.

789
01:44:14,375 --> 01:44:15,958
The Buddha will fall upon
the coronation stage.

790
01:44:16,042 --> 01:44:18,374
No one will survive in the Palace.

791
01:44:20,334 --> 01:44:22,124
l know you too well.

792
01:44:22,209 --> 01:44:27,458
I heard you were brought back for the case,
so I advised the Prince to kill you,

793
01:44:27,542 --> 01:44:33,874
or you would ruin our plan.
But that old fool refused to listen.

794
01:44:33,875 --> 01:44:38,749
He even called me a flunkey,
so I killed him.

795
01:44:39,792 --> 01:44:43,791
Now I have his tally in my hand.
100,000 soldiers are outside the city.

796
01:44:43,875 --> 01:44:47,791
Once the Buddha falls down,
they will enter the city to kill the bitch.

797
01:44:50,542 --> 01:44:52,749
Even you can't survive this.

798
01:45:04,084 --> 01:45:05,874
Break!

799
01:46:19,292 --> 01:46:22,458
The molten metal will run
into the tubular pillar and melt its base.

800
01:46:22,542 --> 01:46:25,416
The Buddha will fall upon
the coronation stage.

801
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:27,958
No one will survive in the Palace.

802
01:46:31,917 --> 01:46:36,416
The time is ripe and Heaven has spoken.

803
01:46:36,500 --> 01:46:40,999
Empress Wu is wise, gentle and generous.

804
01:46:41,084 --> 01:46:46,208
For unification, she shall become Emperor.

805
01:46:46,292 --> 01:46:53,291
Let this be known to the world!

806
01:46:54,625 --> 01:47:00,291
Detective Dee! You can't get out!
I'll let you be buried with the bitch!

807
01:47:24,250 --> 01:47:28,208
Shatuo, your plan has failed!

808
01:47:51,375 --> 01:47:53,499
I can't stop the Buddha from collapsing,

809
01:47:53,584 --> 01:47:55,833
but the molten metal from the southwest
has stopped.

810
01:47:55,917 --> 01:48:00,124
The angle of the collapse will change.
It won't fall upon the coronation stage.

811
01:48:02,209 --> 01:48:05,541
I won't give up!

812
01:48:15,459 --> 01:48:17,624
I haven't failed. I haven't.

813
01:48:17,709 --> 01:48:20,416
After the Buddha has fallen,
the guards will be in panic!

814
01:48:20,500 --> 01:48:22,333
I haven't failed!

815
01:48:25,042 --> 01:48:28,249
Wait and see. I haven't failed!

816
01:48:40,084 --> 01:48:42,208
Open the door!

817
01:48:44,792 --> 01:48:47,374
-It's collapsing!
-Run!

818
01:49:19,375 --> 01:49:23,749
Shatuo! Give up!
This is your last chance!

819
01:50:26,667 --> 01:50:28,999
Your Majesty!
The Towering Buddha is wobbling.

820
01:50:29,084 --> 01:50:33,083
It's falling towards the palace.
Please take shelter, your Majesty!

821
01:51:46,167 --> 01:51:48,458
I haven't failed.

822
01:51:58,667 --> 01:51:59,958
It's really collapsing!

823
01:52:00,042 --> 01:52:04,749
Your Majesty! We can't stay here.
Let's leave right now.

824
01:52:04,834 --> 01:52:06,499
Your Majesty?
Your Majesty!

825
01:52:17,417 --> 01:52:21,666
Protect Her Majesty!
Please leave immediately!

826
01:52:42,625 --> 01:52:44,499
Hey!

827
01:52:45,125 --> 01:52:48,458
Don't run that way!

828
01:53:27,917 --> 01:53:29,458
Go save the Empress!

829
01:53:29,542 --> 01:53:32,791
Your Majesty!

830
01:53:32,875 --> 01:53:34,124
Let's go over there.

831
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:48,708
Your Majesty!

832
01:53:54,375 --> 01:53:56,916
It was Detective Dee who saved me...

833
01:53:58,834 --> 01:54:01,291
A rebel army is gathered
30 miles from here.

834
01:54:01,375 --> 01:54:04,541
They will invade once the Buddha
collapses.

835
01:54:08,834 --> 01:54:12,624
-Where's General Yao?
-I am here!

836
01:54:12,709 --> 01:54:15,124
Report the situation outside the city!

837
01:54:15,125 --> 01:54:19,833
60,000 imperial guards have been
in Bianzhou since before daybreak!

838
01:54:19,917 --> 01:54:25,458
Tell General Zhang to lead 100,000 soldiers
to attack the enemies in the east

839
01:54:25,542 --> 01:54:31,166
-until the rebels are totally destroyed.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

840
01:54:37,667 --> 01:54:40,624
You were well prepared indeed.

841
01:54:42,917 --> 01:54:47,249
Detective Dee, from this day onwards,

842
01:54:47,334 --> 01:54:52,541
the whole world shall know
you were my saviour.

843
01:54:54,292 --> 01:54:59,958
May I venture to say a few words
to you in front of the mace?

844
01:55:00,042 --> 01:55:02,666
Preposterous!

845
01:55:02,750 --> 01:55:06,166
-Stand down.
-Your Majesty!

846
01:55:06,250 --> 01:55:11,166
-I told you to stand down!
-Stand down, everybody!

847
01:55:15,542 --> 01:55:20,166
Under Heaven,
with this mace as the witness,

848
01:55:20,250 --> 01:55:25,083
would the sacred Empress Wu
please listen:

849
01:55:28,417 --> 01:55:32,666
On the pretence of magic,
you wantonly killed clansmen and officials.

850
01:55:32,750 --> 01:55:34,416
This is unpardonable!

851
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:39,374
But society is on the brink of extinction,
so your punishment is hereby suspended.

852
01:55:39,459 --> 01:55:44,624
Ruling requires power and stratagems,
but right and wrong cannot be confused!

853
01:55:44,709 --> 01:55:47,208
May the Empress know her every move,

854
01:55:47,292 --> 01:55:52,833
and let Tang clansmen succeed her, so
that everything will be back as it should be.

855
01:55:56,667 --> 01:55:59,374
You called me "Empress"?

856
01:55:59,459 --> 01:56:04,458
Long live the Empress!

857
01:56:11,792 --> 01:56:17,208
Officials are lazy, nobody can help me.

858
01:56:17,292 --> 01:56:21,083
For the people, will you stay and help me.

859
01:56:21,167 --> 01:56:29,333
I've been in rebellion several times.
How dare I meddle with state affairs?

860
01:56:32,959 --> 01:56:39,666
My assignment is over.
I'm returning this mace to the Empress.

861
01:57:18,959 --> 01:57:21,708
The truth has come to light.

862
01:57:21,792 --> 01:57:24,874
The world is at peace finally.

863
01:57:24,959 --> 01:57:28,541
But Detective Dee is in the Phantom
Bazaar.

864
01:57:32,084 --> 01:57:37,624
Whether your fire beetle poison is curable
will depend on the will of Heaven.

865
01:57:37,709 --> 01:57:40,249
The will of Heaven is bright and clear,
but I'm travelling alone.

866
01:57:40,334 --> 01:57:44,374
Heaven and Earth have no space for me,
but my heart is at peace.

867
01:57:48,417 --> 01:57:52,083
The sun is up. Let's go down.

868
01:58:15,375 --> 01:58:19,541
ln 690 A.D., Empress Wu
became the first and only female Emperor

869
01:58:19,625 --> 01:58:21,791
in the history of China.

870
01:58:24,667 --> 01:58:30,708
15 years later, in 705 A.D.,
Empress Wu retired from the throne,

871
01:58:30,792 --> 01:58:38,666
returning the title to the Crown Prince,
in honour of her promise to Detective Dee.
