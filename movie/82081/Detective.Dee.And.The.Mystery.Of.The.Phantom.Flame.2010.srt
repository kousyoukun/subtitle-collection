< Detective Dee
and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame >

16
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:40,374
The Empress hereby decrees:

17
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:44,957
The Court of State Ceremonials shall

18
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,207
welcome Umayyad diplomat Aspar

19
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,999
and escort him to the Towering Buddha

20
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:52,624
to revere the Empress's divine glory.

21
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:05,374
The Buddha is sixty six yards high,

22
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,832
which means there are thirty three heavens

23
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,832
beyond the first thirty three heavens,

24
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,415
symbolizing reaching the ninth cloud.

25
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:16,124
I already explained it to the General.

26
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:24,124
Will it be ready before the Coronation?

27
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,874
Sure, otherwise. . .

28
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,999
my life cannot be spared.

29
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,374
This is so spectacular!

30
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:44,624
Huge resources have been spent on this.

31
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:48,124
2 million catties of metal were used.

32
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:52,665
More than 1 000 catties are burnt each day.

33
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,624
The temperature is too high here.

34
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:59,790
Bring water and a towel for the General!

35
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,499
The General asked of whom the portrait is.

36
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,415
This is Lu Li, our Imperial Chaplain.

37
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:23,624
He's very potent and trusted by the Empress!

38
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:27,415
These are amulets bestowed by the Chaplain.

39
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:30,207
They can dispel evil and thwart disaster...

40
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,707
It's unbearably hot inside the Buddha.

41
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:39,790
We need to drink at least 2 liters of water a day.

42
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,415
We have to report this!

43
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:46,415
This is serious and we should do it
before lives are lost!

44
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,374
Shatuo, you better go.

45
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,415
Let's go up from here.

46
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:58,915
Today's so clear we can see miles from here!

47
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:15,457
This tubular pillar is crucial to the Buddha.

48
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:19,040
It's 72 yards long and made from one casting.

49
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,165
It is surrounded by. . .

50
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,624
81 steel chains.

51
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,040
In the face of hurricanes or earthquakes,

52
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,874
the chains will pull in the opposite
direction to prevent collapsing.

53
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:41,040
General, these are the Buddha's two eyes.

54
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,624
Master Jia... Master Jia. . .

55
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:43,790
Don't you see we have guests here?

56
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,915
Please. . .

57
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,040
- What's the matter with you?
- When you...

58
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:51,790
inspected the pillar yesterday,

59
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,540
you removed some amulets.

60
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,665
Should we put them back?

61
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,082
They haven't been put back?

62
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:01,582
Moving the amulets will bring bad luck, so...

63
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:03,749
After you have moved them,

64
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,082
- we all feel so scared that. . .
- I know.

65
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,165
nobody dared to put them back.

66
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,457
Our work has been stuck.

67
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,749
Put them back right away. Hurry up!

68
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:13,499
It's needless to say.

69
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:26,832
This way, please.

70
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,624
The General says we can see

71
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,499
the coronation stage here.

72
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:52,624
The General says...

73
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,290
Sir... Sir...

74
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,790

Master Xue.

87
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:28,707
Yes. . .

88
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,457
Sir, the corpse has been burnt to ashes.

89
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,207
No flesh was left.

90
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,540
So strange?

91
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,415
We must find out the cause of the fire.

92
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,124
Any forensic findings from the corpse?

93
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,957
Sir! We found this on the corpse.

94
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:54,082
Phosphorus! The corpse is filled with it!

95
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:59,457
Much phosphorus is stored inside the Buddha
to melt the copper.

96
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:03,040
I bet this gave the murderer the opportunity

97
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,499
to use what's already in the scene.

98
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:13,499
Master Jia was burnt by yellow phosphorus!

99
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,040
No, not the phosphorus.

100
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:24,624
The flame exploded from inside the body.

101
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:28,582
Pei? How could the flame explode from inside?

102
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,124
Sir, look at his shoe.

103
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,124
The bones were burnt to ashes

104
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:35,290
and left inside the shoe,

105
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,124
but its outside remains unscathed.

106
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,624
The flame must have been burnt from inside.

107
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:41,540
Otherwise, how could this have happened?

108
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,207
Perhaps not!

109
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,790
But the corpse is dense with phosphorus.

110
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:49,874
Someone must have poisoned his food!

111
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:53,624
Phosphorus stinks. He couldn't miss it.

112
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,165
Even if he had taken it by mistake,

113
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,165
the symptoms should be. . .

114
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,832
shortness of breath and bodily pain,
but not be aflame.

115
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:05,207
Cut the crap. The murderer is among you.

116
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,749
Nab them all back for interrogation!

117
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:08,999
Sir... Sir.

118
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,665
Don't panic!

119
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:20,665
We can continue our work after the interrogation.

120
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,665
You... the supervisor.

121
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,915
Sir, if you arrest me,

122
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,457
our work will be delayed and we're doomed.

123
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:33,707
What's in your left hand?

124
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:41,582
What is this? What happened to your hand?

125
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,874
I was punished by the Ministry of Justice

126
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,582
and had been jailed for eight years

127
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:55,332
for involving in Detective Dee's treason.

128
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:57,832
Treason?

129
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,624
A dork like you in treason?

130
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,749
Then you had to be involved.

131
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:16,290
Sir, if the Buddha can't be finished on time,
the Empress will blame us.

132
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:19,457
Supreme Court won't be better off either.

133
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,790
You dare to threaten us with the Empress?

134
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,457
Good. I'll give you want you want.

135
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:30,915
I'll chop your right hand off as well.

136
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:33,165
He was struck by divine intervention!

137
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,707
Master Jia was struck by divine intervention!

138
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:39,707
Out of my way!

139
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,624
You bugger, cut this crap!

140
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,749
What superstition are you trying to say?

141
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,582
What divine intervention? Spit it out!

142
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,957
Master Jia moved the amulets

143
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,332
during his inspection a few days ago.

144
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:55,415
Bestowed amulets should never be moved.

145
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,290
Stop spreading these fallacies!

146
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:01,082
Amulets? Can't be moved?

147
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,374
Let me do it.

148
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,415
What's up? You want to try too?

149
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,457
Do you believe it?

150
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:22,665
Let me move one and you'll all see

151
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:28,332
if divine intervention would strike me now!

152
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,040
Nab all those who went to the top today

153
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:33,665
and take them back.

154
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:36,999
Handcuff them up at the main gate.

155
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,665
Donglai, you come with me to the Palace

156
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,665
and report the case to the Empress.

157
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,290
Everybody else guards over here.

158
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,457
Arrest them all when you've order
from the Empress.

159
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:53,499
Yes, Sir!

160
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:17,999
Your Majesty, General Yao just entered,

161
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:21,874
leading 200 soldiers from Longzhou.

162
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:25,874
Following behind is General Qiu,

163
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:29,082
with an army of 600 to protect Your Majesty.

164
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,374
Your Majesty, Master Xue of Supreme Court

165
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,165
and his subordinate Pei request an interview!

166
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,707
Let them approach!

167
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,040
Your Majesty, Pei Donglai of Supreme Court.

168
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,665
Regarding the torched death of Jia Yi,

169
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,624
- my preliminary investigation indicates. . .
- He's on fire!

170
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:05,957
What's wrong with Master Jia?

171
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,249
How come he's on fire?

172
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,374
- Protect Her Majesty!
- Protect Her Majesty!

173
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,249
The Empress hereby decrees:

174
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:53,040
2000 more Guards shall be garrisoned
inside the palace.

175
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:56,124
Those without permits shall be killed
without reprieve.

176
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,790
The Palace becomes so dark by night.

177
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,415
Fire is not allowed in the palace any more.

178
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,790
All flames were replaced by night pearls.

179
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,957
Nobody knows what had happened to the Empress.

180
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:10,707
All food and drinks came from outside...

181
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,874
and they all turned cold
when delivered to the Empress.

182
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,999
We all worry about her.

183
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:22,040
Your Majesty... Your Majesty.

184
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:25,832
I don't want to smell that again!

185
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:27,457
The coronation is imminent.

186
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:28,874
Your Majesty should mind your health.

187
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,415
I've even ordered your favorite soup.

188
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:44,290
You don't need to test-eat anymore.

189
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,665
Leave that to your subordinates.

190
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,499
Your Majesty has to rule the world.

191
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,665
I live and die for Your Majesty.

192
00:15:56,041 --> 00:16:00,499
Remember you have to stay alive.

193
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:04,165
Only then can you defeat your enemies.

194
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,790
Since I entered the palace at the age of 14,

195
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,749
I've braved through crises after crises.

196
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:13,832
Had I been careless, I'd have been crushed

197
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:19,915
I would never think of ascending
the throne by a woman.

198
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,290
Your Majesty, dinner is safe to eat.

199
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:43,082
Your Majesty, the Imperial Chaplain is here.

200
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,915
- Hurry up... - Where?

201
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,624
Everything is transient;

202
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,665
follow Heaven's Mandate.

203
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:06,999
Welcome, Chaplain. Everyone, on your knees!

204
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,290
Yes, Your Majesty.

205
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,374
The astronomical phenomena have been chaotic.

206
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,249
An evil availed of my spiritual sabbatical

207
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:17,624
to disturb the royal soil against nature.

208
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,540
Would the Chaplain please enlighten me?

209
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,540
The evil has been committing crimes

210
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,415
as Venus has left the Palace for 8 years.

211
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:28,457
It's being locked up and has not returned.

212
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:33,249
Locked up? Is Venus a prisoner?

213
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:38,624
Venus originated from Yang Qui of Dee City.

214
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,332
Left the Palace for 8 years?

215
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,374
Originated from Dee City?

216
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:47,124
Does the Chaplain mean Detective Dee?

217
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,915
8 years ago, Dee opposed your regency

218
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,582
and was jailed for treason.

219
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,957
If we release him,

220
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,874
the dissenters will become more recalcitrant!

221
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,332
Please think twice, Your Majesty.

222
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:03,332
As soon as Venus has returned,

223
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,040
chaos will end and all stars are at peace.

224
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:13,165
Find out whether Dee is dead or alive?

225
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,457
May I know who you are?

226
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,832
"MINISTER OFFICE"

227
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,874
Welcome, Officer Shangguan.

228
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:32,790
LIAISON OFFICE, for filing provincial memorials

229
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,540
The East needs 6,000 soldiers
to suppress the barbarians.

230
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:39,665
The South reported floodings along Yao River.

231
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,332
Memorial to Public Works Dept.

232
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,249
The South has been such a mess lately.

233
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,040
After the flood came the starvation.

234
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:53,374
Tie your tongue and get the memorials.

235
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,624
Here come the memorials. Talk later.

236
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:59,165
The earlier we burn them, the earlier we can rest.

237
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:03,707
Memorials are prescriptions for the state.

238
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:06,915
We know the state's illness by reading them.

239
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:10,499
But the memorials in recent years show that

240
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,082
people are living in contentment.

241
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,290
people's livelihood has improved

242
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:15,957
and they are living in contentment.

243
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,915
You might as well save your breath.

244
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:23,499
Ling. . .

245
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:29,999
we might get involved this time.

246
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,374
What?

247
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,707
Listen.

248
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,999
Yes!

249
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,915
I hear that! Quite a number of men. . .

250
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,749
You said if you were to leave here alive,

251
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:51,332
you might have to fight a big battle. . .

252
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,540
A battle of life and death.

253
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:54,957
Do what I taught you.

254
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,832
Yes, I'm ready for it.

255
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:41,332
Push the cart down.

256
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:11,332
20cm to the left!

257
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:13,290
1 cm below!

258
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,999
Turn around and swing. . .

259
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:16,582
Do it again!

260
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:43,540
Surround the furnace!

261
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:44,457
Get them alive!

262
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:45,957
Don't let anyone flee!

263
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:49,790
Protect the Officer!

264
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:50,790
Get lost!

265
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:54,665
There's ambush on the roof!

266
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,374
Hidden arrows! Bend over!

267
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:02,624
Nab them alive! Check who they are!

268
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,540
They're killing themselves as their last resort.

269
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:20,165
Don't let the assassins jump! Stop them!

270
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:22,374
Help me to grab them back from the furnace.

271
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:23,415
Yes.

272
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:31,124
You! Go after the archer on the roof!

273
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:35,124
Didn't you hear? Go after the archer!

274
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:36,499
Yes.

275
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:38,040
No need to chase.

276
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,915
They can come and go at ease

277
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:41,582
in this maximum security prison,

278
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,582
They must be abetted by someone inside.

279
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:46,249
Nonsense!

280
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:49,207
How can the killers be our men?

281
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:52,040
They can even kill themselves in the end.

282
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:56,249
The leader behind is way too powerful for you.

283
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,582
Perhaps not for her.

284
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:03,124
This official is elegantly dressed
with an impressing bearing.

285
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,915
I bet you're from the Palace.

286
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:17,374
No need. He's really blind.

287
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:21,999
Why did you feign blindness?

288
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:26,499
A peaceful heart will enhance my observations.

289
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:30,165
To observe by heart is different from by eye.

290
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:31,915
You're speaking my words.

291
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:34,207
A blind like him

292
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:35,999
sees the world clearer than we do.

293
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,707
Forget it, Dee.

294
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,124
You are no longer a prisoner.

295
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:41,374
Can I call you Detective Dee now?

296
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:44,040
Good or bad luck, only I myself will know

297
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,665
This furnace is very hot

298
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:47,999
but it's nothing when compared
to the outside world.

299
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:50,999
A single mistake will make myself on fire.

300
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:53,832
If I don't leave, the fire will also come for me.

301
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:55,832
Struggling for power starts the fire.

302
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,707
No power means no fire, heaven for everyone.

303
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:03,582
The outside world is really on fire now.

304
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:07,332
Watch out for fire!

305
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:31,499
Military examination in the year 689!

306
00:24:31,916 --> 00:24:35,165
On the right is Chen from Xiangzhou;

307
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:37,124
his weapon will be the iron rod.

308
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:41,499
On the left is Yen from Yangzhou;

309
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,582
his weapon will be the meteor hammer.

310
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:46,040
The tournament begins!

311
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:07,415
Your Majesty, Dee has been brought here.

312
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,582
You knew you're coming to see me,

313
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,332
but you're still in prison clothes

314
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,665
and you didn't even shave?

315
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:16,874
Years ago when I opposed your regency,

316
00:25:17,041 --> 00:25:18,040
I had already been accused of treason.

317
00:25:18,666 --> 00:25:20,165
Now that your coronation is imminent,

318
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:22,915
I might have to put them on again soon...

319
00:25:23,375 --> 00:25:25,332
So I decided not to change.

320
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,540
Leave us alone, Jing'er.

321
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:32,957
Yes.

322
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:50,624
The Crown Prince was very little then.

323
00:25:50,833 --> 00:25:52,874
I helped him rule as an Empress Dowager.

324
00:25:53,041 --> 00:25:55,665
What's wrong with that?

325
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:57,790
And yet you had to oppose.

326
00:25:57,958 --> 00:25:59,665
During my rule for the last 8 years,

327
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:02,915
the state is incorrupt and the people rich.

328
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:06,165
Even the Crown Prince begged me
in writing to ascend the throne.

329
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:09,832
What more can you say?

330
00:26:10,541 --> 00:26:11,624
Nothing.

331
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,290
You men are just not used to women in power.

332
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,124
One can't be conservative in state matters

333
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:20,957
but has to reform constantly.

334
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:22,165
Reform is good,

335
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:25,540
but all new things will turn old one day.

336
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:27,957
While the old are being replaced by the new,

337
00:26:28,416 --> 00:26:29,832
if it also involves their lives as well,

338
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:31,082
then rebellions become inevitable.

339
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,874
Not only men. . . even dogs will try to flee.

340
00:26:44,458 --> 00:26:46,415
Detective Dee is still Detective Dee.

341
00:26:47,291 --> 00:26:49,165
Your precious words are so hurtful to the ears.

342
00:26:55,375 --> 00:26:58,665
That was your badge 8 years ago.

343
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:00,832
I'm returning it to you.

344
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:02,874
You shall be my Imperial Commissioner

345
00:27:03,041 --> 00:27:04,499
in charge of the Phantom Flame Case.

346
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:07,249
You shall work with Supreme Court

347
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,999
to crack the case before my coronation!

348
00:27:36,375 --> 00:27:37,790
Why do you keep following me?

349
00:27:38,916 --> 00:27:41,207
Her Majesty knows you've suffered in jail

350
00:27:41,583 --> 00:27:43,707
and specifically ordered me to serve you.

351
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:46,040
You have such a deadly look.

352
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:48,915
It must be a pain to be served by you!

353
00:27:55,916 --> 00:27:57,624
So lively here?

354
00:27:57,958 --> 00:27:59,832
Who's having dinner in the inn?

355
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:02,249
The Prince of Lanya is having a banquet.

356
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:04,415
Li Xiao commands an army of 1 00,000

357
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:06,374
and is haughty because of his royal status.

358
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:07,915
He is at loggerheads with the Empress

359
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:09,415
and has long intended to revolt.

360
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:11,749
He must be involved in this case.

361
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:13,665
You better check him out.

362
00:28:14,583 --> 00:28:15,499
Having the intention to revolt

363
00:28:15,666 --> 00:28:17,332
does not mean he's involved in this case.

364
00:28:17,625 --> 00:28:18,624
You better get it right.

365
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:26,874
These are your clothings before you were jailed.

366
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:29,040
Her Majesty ordered me to find these for you.

367
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:31,624
Only my Dragon Taming Mace is missing.

368
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,957
It's getting late and I won't go out any more.

369
00:28:37,541 --> 00:28:39,124
You don't have to keep an eye on me too.

370
00:28:43,833 --> 00:28:44,957
Have you forgotten?

371
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:47,540
Her Majesty has ordered me to serve you.

372
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:51,749
Without the order from the Empress,

373
00:28:51,916 --> 00:28:53,499
I will not go back tonight.

374
00:29:00,541 --> 00:29:04,957
To serve me. . .

375
00:29:13,416 --> 00:29:15,457
Where's the water?

376
00:29:15,791 --> 00:29:16,957
That's how you serve people?

377
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:25,082
How can the Empress stand you?

378
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:27,207
You are too weird to serve people

379
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:32,040
and you're so impetuous.

380
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,415
Yes, I am.

381
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:58,540
I've given you the blade.

382
00:29:59,458 --> 00:30:01,499
Come, shave for me.

383
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:08,707
Stop dodging if you have guts!

384
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:10,457
The Empress asked you to serve me,

385
00:30:11,416 --> 00:30:12,540
but don't take it in face value.

386
00:30:13,875 --> 00:30:17,207
She wants you to spy on me but also to test you. . .

387
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:19,374
For every single word you've said,

388
00:30:20,708 --> 00:30:22,874
I'll report to Her Majesty.

389
00:30:23,875 --> 00:30:25,499
All right, let me tell you this.

390
00:30:25,666 --> 00:30:27,540
She always overestimate herself and

391
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:30,374
she does not believe in anyone.

392
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,249
If we really become together,

393
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:35,540
her suspicion will turn her against you.

394
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:37,624
She won't let you off.

395
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,040
Why do you stop shaving?

396
00:30:39,208 --> 00:30:41,249
My beard is not there. . .

397
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,749
It's here.

398
00:30:48,083 --> 00:30:49,957
I suggest you tell her we can't get along.

399
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:55,207
That will set her mind at peace.

400
00:30:57,083 --> 00:31:00,124
Let me see if she is what you said she is.

401
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:16,165
Don't make it difficult for yourself.

402
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:20,124
If you don't want it, don't force yourself.

403
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:25,457
But do you want it?

404
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:39,499
Come over!

405
00:31:41,625 --> 00:31:42,124
What do you want?

406
00:31:42,291 --> 00:31:43,374
Hold this.

407
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:04,249
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

408
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:05,874
I gave you the whip. You still didn't get it?

409
00:32:58,041 --> 00:32:58,832
Don't touch me.

410
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:33,374
Who are these people?

411
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,999
- Protect the Prince!
- Assassins!

412
00:33:39,125 --> 00:33:42,457
I've been waiting for you, Brother Dee.

413
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:45,082
Why aren't you on your knees?

414
00:33:46,208 --> 00:33:49,415
I'm chasing suspects. No time for formality.

415
00:33:49,583 --> 00:33:53,457
The Phantom Flame was staged by

416
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:56,249
the Chaplain under the order of the Empress!

417
00:33:57,291 --> 00:33:59,165
She wants to usurp the throne

418
00:33:59,833 --> 00:34:01,790
and eliminate old officials like us.

419
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:04,665
I'm occupied. See you later!

420
00:34:04,833 --> 00:34:07,374
Dee, receive the Military Tally!

421
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:12,415
With this tally, you can deploy any troops.

422
00:34:12,625 --> 00:34:15,457
In view of your loyal nature,

423
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:18,124
I'm inviting you to join my Army of Justice.

424
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:19,707
I'm in command of 1 00,000 soldiers

425
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:21,582
and have a fail-proof plan

426
00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:25,290
to overturn the evil empress!

427
00:34:26,375 --> 00:34:28,124
- Assassins? Who is it?
- Who is it?

428
00:34:28,291 --> 00:34:28,999
That's outrageous.

429
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:33,165
Li Xiao!

430
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:36,290
How dare you rave like that?

431
00:34:38,708 --> 00:34:41,332
I won't chat with you now that she's here.

432
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,082
But remember, one of these days...

433
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:51,207
you'll grovel before me

434
00:34:51,708 --> 00:34:53,582
and take my orders.

435
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:56,457
It won't be far.

436
00:34:56,875 --> 00:35:00,582
Grovel before me and take my orders...

437
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,624
You'll ruin your integrity.

438
00:35:08,666 --> 00:35:10,790
He must have ordered the kill just now.

439
00:35:11,166 --> 00:35:13,790
Why kills me if he wants to buy me off?

440
00:35:14,458 --> 00:35:16,624
He wants you dead as he can't buy you off.

441
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:17,499
No.

442
00:35:17,666 --> 00:35:18,665
No?

443
00:35:22,666 --> 00:35:23,749
He doesn't want me dead.

444
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:28,249
It's someone else who does.

445
00:35:32,166 --> 00:35:34,790
The Empress hereby decrees:

446
00:35:35,291 --> 00:35:38,207
Mysterious cases are rampant lately.

447
00:35:38,541 --> 00:35:41,040
Theses are works of villains to cheat people.

448
00:35:41,291 --> 00:35:43,040
I hereby appoint Dee as Imperial Commissioner

449
00:35:43,416 --> 00:35:45,124
to lead Supreme Court

450
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:49,707
to solve the Phantom Flame Case
before my Coronation.

451
00:35:49,875 --> 00:35:50,915
I humbly receive the Imperial Edict.

452
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:56,374
Commissioner, you do have a unique style.

453
00:35:56,583 --> 00:35:58,082
You bring your bird out while on duty?

454
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,749
I must bring this along with me.

455
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:02,999
We can't solve the case without it.

456
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:06,124
Where does the sun go this morning?

457
00:36:11,541 --> 00:36:14,540
This is the mortuary. This way, please.

458
00:36:23,208 --> 00:36:24,415
The bird is afraid to go in.

459
00:36:25,041 --> 00:36:26,665
Find someone outside to take care of it.

460
00:36:39,375 --> 00:36:42,582
The deceased was Jia of the 4th rank,

461
00:36:43,125 --> 00:36:47,499
Vice Minister of Public Works.

462
00:36:48,791 --> 00:36:52,499
On the 1 7th day of the 8th month, 1 -3pm. . .

463
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:55,124
he was self-burnt to ashes. . .

464
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,457
- inside the Buddha,
- What do you think of this case?

465
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:05,290
leaving remains of...

466
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:07,749
- Go watch over the bird outside.
- left fibula...

467
00:37:10,541 --> 00:37:12,957
I was ordered to follow you closely.

468
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:15,457
You want to return this badge to the Empress?

469
00:37:21,625 --> 00:37:23,582
Just keep an eye on it but don't touch it.

470
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:25,957
Don't get too close too!

471
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:27,790
Shut the door!

472
00:37:42,208 --> 00:37:43,207
Keep reading.

473
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:48,499
The deceased was Xue of the 3rd rank...

474
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,332
Louder!

475
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:54,665
The deceased was Xue of the 3rd rank...

476
00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:03,832
You can speak now.

477
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:12,207
The murder technique is not human.

478
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:14,915
Cut the generality. You're not to the point.

479
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,415
Who do you think it is?

480
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,374
Rumor has it that the Chaplain Lu Li

481
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:24,874
is on a murder spree before the Coronation

482
00:38:25,041 --> 00:38:26,040
to set an example.

483
00:38:36,666 --> 00:38:38,499
To warn the dissenters

484
00:38:38,708 --> 00:38:40,582
not to act rashly.

485
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:44,082
Jia was sent by the Empress. Why betrayed her?

486
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,207
He's unfathomable.

487
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,540
I read Jia's memorials before.

488
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,457
He inspected the Buddha every month.

489
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,249
The schedule for the Buddha is very tight.

490
00:38:53,416 --> 00:38:55,915
Wouldn't killing him hinder the Coronation?

491
00:38:58,333 --> 00:39:01,915
You read Master Jia's memorials?

492
00:39:02,916 --> 00:39:04,790
I read memorials at the Liaison Office

493
00:39:04,958 --> 00:39:06,249
before they were burnt every day.

494
00:39:10,541 --> 00:39:13,707
Moving the amulet causes divine intervention.

495
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:15,165
The Chaplain is killing with black magic.

496
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:17,582
You believe all this nonsense?

497
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,624
It's evident. Why can't I believe it?

498
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:23,624
You're lying.

499
00:39:24,583 --> 00:39:26,124
We both know the amulets are just a front.

500
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:28,582
The murderer is trying to hide the truth.

501
00:39:31,083 --> 00:39:32,540
I thought only I got that.

502
00:39:32,916 --> 00:39:34,249
So you also think likewise.

503
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:35,915
She's still spying on us.

504
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:37,582
Let's play her.

505
00:39:45,625 --> 00:39:49,874
What I think of is. . .
you'll be promoted after Xue died.

506
00:39:50,041 --> 00:39:52,249
That makes you a suspect as well.

507
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:58,290
Then why do you think I killed Master Jia?

508
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:03,207
You killed Master Jia as a diversion.

509
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:05,374
Your real target is your superior.

510
00:40:05,541 --> 00:40:07,415
You may have another reason for killing Jia.

511
00:40:12,833 --> 00:40:14,415
You can also thwart the Coronation.

512
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:19,790
Don't stop.

513
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:20,874
I'm done. . .

514
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:23,499
Start again till I ask you to stop.

515
00:40:27,208 --> 00:40:28,832
The deceased Detective Dee

516
00:40:29,375 --> 00:40:31,915
had a fierce fight with Minister Pei...

517
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:37,040
You're framing me!

518
00:40:37,541 --> 00:40:39,082
Didn't you ask us to play her?

519
00:40:39,541 --> 00:40:40,832
Why are you so serious?

520
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:47,374
I was acting. Couldn't you tell?

521
00:40:57,666 --> 00:40:59,499
Master Pei, the birdcage is on fire!

522
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:03,082
Sir... the birdcage is on fire, Master Pei!

523
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:03,749
What's the cause?

524
00:41:03,916 --> 00:41:04,832
No cause at all.

525
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:09,874
The bird is aflame

526
00:41:10,541 --> 00:41:11,707
like those officials.

527
00:41:11,875 --> 00:41:12,790
How could this have happened?

528
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:15,082
Let's go to the dining room.

529
00:41:21,708 --> 00:41:22,832
What are you cooking?

530
00:41:23,541 --> 00:41:24,999
Stir-fried cucumbers with snow lotus.

531
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:26,624
Any chicken blood?

532
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:27,957
Over there.

533
00:41:28,125 --> 00:41:28,999
What's he doing?

534
00:41:29,458 --> 00:41:31,624
He probably found out why the victims caught fire.

535
00:41:55,125 --> 00:41:58,749
Master Xue caught fire at 3-5pm?

536
00:41:58,916 --> 00:41:59,582
Right.

537
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:03,290
The Buddha was surrounded by shadows
as the sun decended.

538
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,957
But once he entered the drill ground,
he's on fire.

539
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:10,415
It is because the drill ground was not covered.

540
00:42:11,083 --> 00:42:13,957
So I infer that the sun triggers the poison!

541
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:23,374
Let's stay away from this.

542
00:43:32,458 --> 00:43:33,540
Detective Dee!

543
00:43:35,833 --> 00:43:39,332
Fancy seeing you again before I die!

544
00:43:41,708 --> 00:43:45,040
We're kept alive for a purpose.

545
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:54,165
You're back in Supreme Court?

546
00:43:57,333 --> 00:43:59,332
The Empress put me in charge of

547
00:44:01,708 --> 00:44:02,957
Dee's position is unclear.

548
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:05,082
We can't let him dupe us.

549
00:44:05,708 --> 00:44:08,207
Let's join forces to check him out.

550
00:44:08,583 --> 00:44:09,582
Join forces?

551
00:44:10,541 --> 00:44:11,957
I work directly under the Empress.

552
00:44:12,458 --> 00:44:15,582
It's not up to you to make suggestions.

553
00:44:34,875 --> 00:44:36,082
What's the matter?

554
00:44:37,458 --> 00:44:40,457
Before the accidents, both officials

555
00:44:41,083 --> 00:44:42,749
did one thing besides

556
00:44:43,625 --> 00:44:45,082
moving the amulets.

557
00:44:47,708 --> 00:44:48,707
What is it?

558
00:44:48,916 --> 00:44:50,082
Water!

559
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:53,040
Before the incidents took place,

560
00:44:53,541 --> 00:44:55,915
they both drank the water here.

561
00:44:56,625 --> 00:44:58,249
It is because the heat here

562
00:44:58,708 --> 00:45:00,415
make them thirsty.

563
00:45:03,291 --> 00:45:07,082
But that can't be! I was supposed
to move the amulet first.

564
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:09,582
Master Xue just happened to come before me.

565
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:12,624
If the murderer killed because of the amulet,

566
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,082
how did he know Master Xue would snatch it

567
00:45:15,416 --> 00:45:17,374
and poison the water beforehand?

568
00:45:18,083 --> 00:45:20,707
It should have nothing to do with the water.

569
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:25,665
You work directly under the Empress.

570
00:45:26,208 --> 00:45:28,249
Do you need to hear my humble opinion?

571
00:45:31,708 --> 00:45:33,082
How have you been all these years?

572
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:34,082
After I was in jail,

573
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,999
I kept professing my loyalty in writing.

574
00:45:36,291 --> 00:45:38,040
Eventually the Empress pardoned me.

575
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:40,082
I joined the Department of Public Works,

576
00:45:40,541 --> 00:45:42,790
in charge of repairing royal palaces.

577
00:45:44,166 --> 00:45:46,165
I was then made supervisor of the Buddha.

578
00:45:48,041 --> 00:45:49,499
In other words, I've been promoted.

579
00:45:54,166 --> 00:45:55,165
How magnificent!

580
00:45:55,333 --> 00:45:58,124
The Tubular Pillar in the Book of Fanyanna?

581
00:45:58,291 --> 00:46:01,332
Yes, I was inspired

582
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:04,415
by the Fanyanna Buddha.

583
00:46:05,791 --> 00:46:07,582
The pillar's base is 1 00 feet underground.

584
00:46:07,916 --> 00:46:09,749
It can withstand earthquakes

585
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,665
and hurricanes.

586
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,415
This is the top level of the Buddha.

587
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,749
Master Jia died inside the Buddha's left eye.

588
00:46:32,208 --> 00:46:33,832
You were also re-enacting the case?

589
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:39,457
After working under you for so many years,

590
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,124
I've been used to case re-enactment.

591
00:46:43,916 --> 00:46:44,957
So what do you think?

592
00:46:47,583 --> 00:46:49,207
Fire turtles...

593
00:46:50,208 --> 00:46:52,832
What are fire turtles?
Are they related to this case?

594
00:46:53,125 --> 00:46:54,874
You also read Book of Fanyanna.

595
00:46:55,708 --> 00:46:59,040
Remember the section on fire turtles?

596
00:46:59,208 --> 00:47:00,040
You think so too?

597
00:47:00,208 --> 00:47:02,374
You haven't answered my questions!

598
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,957
The most venomous beetles in Western Regions.

599
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:06,207
They feed on yellow phosphorus

600
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,374
and their bodies catch fire under the sun.

601
00:47:10,791 --> 00:47:12,957
So the beetles are related to the two deaths?

602
00:47:14,541 --> 00:47:16,540
I witnessed what happened that day.

603
00:47:17,041 --> 00:47:19,582
Only later did I think of the fire turtles.

604
00:47:21,208 --> 00:47:21,749
You think!

605
00:47:21,916 --> 00:47:24,415
Stop it, Donglai!

606
00:47:25,791 --> 00:47:28,415
You knew this clue all along.

607
00:47:28,708 --> 00:47:30,415
Why did you rant about divine intervention?

608
00:47:31,791 --> 00:47:35,082
As a menial

609
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:36,874
I used my wit when threatened.

610
00:47:37,625 --> 00:47:39,540
To be honest, even if I'd told you my theory,

611
00:47:40,375 --> 00:47:43,749
given your wisdom, you wouldn't believe it.

612
00:47:45,583 --> 00:47:46,624
Bullshit!

613
00:47:47,083 --> 00:47:49,665
Calm down. I've known him for years.

614
00:47:49,958 --> 00:47:51,249
That's how he is.

615
00:47:56,333 --> 00:47:57,082
Come!

616
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,915
Detain him for extreme torture later.

617
00:48:00,083 --> 00:48:00,874
Yes!

618
00:48:01,333 --> 00:48:02,207
Stop it!

619
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,790
The Empress has asked me to lead the case.

620
00:48:08,125 --> 00:48:10,707
I can decide everything without intervention.

621
00:48:10,875 --> 00:48:12,124
All of you stand down!

622
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:17,957
What other clues do you have? Spit it out!

623
00:48:18,875 --> 00:48:20,290
I'm only speculating.

624
00:48:20,583 --> 00:48:23,165
After all, fire turtles are not indigenous.

625
00:48:23,458 --> 00:48:25,124
For more details

626
00:48:25,625 --> 00:48:27,165
we need help. . .

627
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:29,290
Phantom Bazaar.

628
00:48:31,958 --> 00:48:33,165
What is Phantom Bazaar?

629
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:36,624
It's a spooky pandemonium.

630
00:48:37,625 --> 00:48:43,290
High officials like you would never go there.

631
00:48:44,875 --> 00:48:45,790
Shatuo

632
00:48:48,166 --> 00:48:49,749
you still remember Donkey Wang?

633
00:48:52,666 --> 00:48:54,915
Luoyang City was built

634
00:48:55,791 --> 00:48:57,624
a thousand years ago.

635
00:48:58,166 --> 00:49:00,999
The old city subsided during Han Dynasty.

636
00:49:01,666 --> 00:49:04,499
A new city was built on top in Sui Dynasty.

637
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,665
The underground became

638
00:49:07,833 --> 00:49:09,582
a black market.

639
00:49:10,333 --> 00:49:11,749
They call it Phantom Bazaar.

640
00:49:33,208 --> 00:49:35,915
Who ordered a boat?

641
00:49:36,541 --> 00:49:37,749
We are looking for Dr Donkey Wang.

642
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:39,290
You know the place?

643
00:49:39,458 --> 00:49:41,540
Wang the Donkey with Scabies?

644
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,624
Five silver coins. Nonrefundable!

645
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:31,582
Anybody here?

646
00:50:34,083 --> 00:50:37,957
Who's been so noisy? It's hell here.

647
00:50:38,583 --> 00:50:40,582
I've never seen in a true villain here.

648
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,165
Speak up.

649
00:50:42,625 --> 00:50:45,499
One... Two. . .

650
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:51,290
you're still alive, Dee!

651
00:50:51,583 --> 00:50:55,040
Scram! This is no place for you people!

652
00:50:55,333 --> 00:50:56,415
I'm here to save you.

653
00:50:56,791 --> 00:51:00,374
Save me? No, I'm fine!

654
00:51:01,541 --> 00:51:03,082
I don't want trouble!

655
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:05,249
It's you who are in trouble. Cut the crap.

656
00:51:09,458 --> 00:51:10,624
- Yummy... yummy.
- Now that I'm here

657
00:51:10,791 --> 00:51:12,165
your good days are over.

658
00:51:12,375 --> 00:51:15,457
Dee, you always bring me troubles.

659
00:51:16,083 --> 00:51:19,999
My luck will help me overcome them.

660
00:51:20,125 --> 00:51:22,332
Since you're here, I better move out now.

661
00:51:22,625 --> 00:51:24,415
Don't be so mean!

662
00:51:29,208 --> 00:51:31,665
Pei! Give me the money!

663
00:51:32,708 --> 00:51:33,665
Put it right here.

664
00:51:37,541 --> 00:51:39,332
Look what I've got here.

665
00:51:43,833 --> 00:51:46,332
What exactly do you want to know?

666
00:51:46,666 --> 00:51:48,249
Ever heard of fire turtles?

667
00:51:51,666 --> 00:51:56,040
Fire turtles? This creature. . .

668
00:51:56,166 --> 00:51:59,915
It has been reported that they're extinct.

669
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:01,332
Could it be they exist in Central Plains?

670
00:52:02,833 --> 00:52:04,040
Can you see

671
00:52:09,375 --> 00:52:10,499
the power of money?

672
00:52:10,666 --> 00:52:13,707
You won't solve this case! Don't even ask.

673
00:52:14,375 --> 00:52:16,499
You haven't answered me. Answer again.

674
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:19,499
- I've answered but you didn't take it.
- Up there.

675
00:52:19,708 --> 00:52:20,790
You don't believe in me at all.

676
00:52:20,958 --> 00:52:21,540
- What's that sound?
- Then why. . .

677
00:52:21,708 --> 00:52:22,749
asked me?

678
00:52:23,083 --> 00:52:24,540
Pay more for additional questions.

679
00:52:27,375 --> 00:52:29,165
Better settle the old bills first.

680
00:52:29,333 --> 00:52:30,249
I'll pay after you've told us.

681
00:52:30,416 --> 00:52:31,665
But you're not trustworthy.

682
00:52:31,833 --> 00:52:32,999
Don't worry about this.

683
00:52:33,208 --> 00:52:34,707
I promise I'll pay after you've told us.

684
00:52:58,208 --> 00:52:58,999
Something is still above!

685
00:53:04,375 --> 00:53:05,582
What are you looking at?

686
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:07,999
Dee is chasing Dr Wang! I'll go to see it.

687
00:55:04,375 --> 00:55:05,249
It's the Imperial Chaplain!

688
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:07,540
Impossible!

689
00:55:28,125 --> 00:55:31,415
Split! Can't you split? Split!

690
00:57:47,541 --> 00:57:49,457
Jing'er is in trouble! I'll help her!

691
00:58:11,791 --> 00:58:14,874
Donglai! Jing'er! Run!

692
00:58:30,583 --> 00:58:32,790
Who is this Wang?

693
00:58:33,083 --> 00:58:34,332
Why does the Chaplain want to kill him?

694
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:35,499
He's not the Chaplain!

695
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:36,957
How can you be so sure?

696
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:39,165
I'm sure because I've seen the Chaplain before.

697
00:58:41,083 --> 00:58:42,207
You don't believe in me?

698
00:58:47,375 --> 00:58:48,957
Hey! The Chaplain is over there!

699
00:58:49,916 --> 00:58:50,915
Told you he isn't.

700
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:52,915
You're so stubborn.

701
00:59:01,458 --> 00:59:03,165
Don't chase. Something weird.

702
00:59:03,458 --> 00:59:04,207
Why?

703
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,415
But Jing'er is by herself...

704
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:09,415
She wants to find his identity more than we.

705
00:59:11,083 --> 00:59:13,749
Their target is Wang. We need to protect him.

706
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,999
Jing'er knows where to find us.

707
00:59:16,458 --> 00:59:18,290
Stop wasting time and let's go!

708
01:00:56,041 --> 01:00:56,874
Jing'er

709
01:01:59,416 --> 01:02:00,749
Almighty infinity?

710
01:02:02,458 --> 01:02:03,540
Infinity Monastery?

711
01:02:23,541 --> 01:02:25,499
There's nobody here. Stop pretending.

712
01:02:26,125 --> 01:02:27,665
Take your pins out.

713
01:02:27,791 --> 01:02:29,749
Dee, you shouldn't put your fingers in every pie.

714
01:02:30,791 --> 01:02:32,290
I was fine down there.

715
01:02:32,541 --> 01:02:34,665
Why dragged me up?

716
01:02:35,666 --> 01:02:38,124
Speak up! Where can we find fire turtles?

717
01:02:38,916 --> 01:02:39,832
If I can crack this case,

718
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,082
I'll help you get back to the Palace.

719
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:42,499
To hell with it!

720
01:02:43,083 --> 01:02:47,749
Who wants to go back? Did I say it?

721
01:02:53,541 --> 01:02:55,832
I advise you not to take up this case!

722
01:02:56,041 --> 01:02:58,707
You can't mess with the people behind it.

723
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:04,832
It can't be done. . . and then. . . and then. . .

724
01:03:05,041 --> 01:03:05,957
Look!

725
01:03:06,541 --> 01:03:09,124
Your transfiguration makes you inarticulate.

726
01:03:10,208 --> 01:03:10,832
Let me see.

727
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,165
Don't touch

728
01:03:12,333 --> 01:03:14,665
these two acupoints!

729
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:17,415
They are anathema to transfiguration!
Don't you know that?

730
01:03:24,875 --> 01:03:25,749
Don't touch me!

731
01:03:26,125 --> 01:03:26,915
What's the matter?

732
01:03:27,083 --> 01:03:30,707
Nothing. These acupoints

733
01:03:31,125 --> 01:03:32,082
remind me of someone.

734
01:03:32,833 --> 01:03:33,707
Who is it?

735
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:39,374
It's all right. It's Donglai and Jing'er.

736
01:03:52,916 --> 01:03:53,707
Who is he?

737
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:57,749
The Imperial Physician, Wang Bo.

738
01:03:58,041 --> 01:04:00,165
A. K.A. Donkey Wang.

739
01:04:03,833 --> 01:04:04,832
He's Donkey Wang?

740
01:04:06,083 --> 01:04:08,624
Could that be the so-called transfiguration?

741
01:04:11,041 --> 01:04:13,290
Well, it's my first time.

742
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:16,082
That's petty stuff. What's so special?

743
01:04:16,291 --> 01:04:18,874
We wasted our whole evening on him.

744
01:04:19,083 --> 01:04:21,624
What's this piece of crap good for?

745
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:24,707
Who is she? So arrogant!

746
01:04:24,875 --> 01:04:30,415
Officer Shangguan, the Empress's favorite.

747
01:04:31,291 --> 01:04:32,832
So you are Shangguan Jing'er?

748
01:04:33,083 --> 01:04:34,915
You are the Empress's bitch?

749
01:04:36,791 --> 01:04:37,707
Bitch?

750
01:04:44,791 --> 01:04:46,624
Speak up! Tell me all you know.

751
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:49,082
Let go of me!

752
01:04:49,416 --> 01:04:51,249
We need torture to make him talk!

753
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:54,290
A confession under torture is useless.

754
01:04:54,458 --> 01:04:56,957
The Empress created many cases of injustice

755
01:04:57,291 --> 01:05:01,165
because of torture and this will only
alienate people from her.

756
01:05:04,291 --> 01:05:06,249
The fire turtles you're looking for

757
01:05:07,625 --> 01:05:10,957
were used for the late Emperor's asthenia.

758
01:05:11,125 --> 01:05:14,624
I heard about them from Western people

759
01:05:14,916 --> 01:05:18,207
and decided to use them to treat asthenia.

760
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:21,124
I presented a memorial to the late Emperor.

761
01:05:21,625 --> 01:05:23,124
The late Emperor personally commanded

762
01:05:23,958 --> 01:05:26,624
Western merchants to present him 20 of them.

763
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,165
We soon discovered that

764
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:33,499
they had no medical value
but a very lethal poison.

765
01:05:34,166 --> 01:05:38,165
Once ingested, one would burn under the sun.

766
01:05:38,333 --> 01:05:41,290
That's the symptom of the Phantom Flame Case!

767
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:45,165
After this failure, I fled for my life.

768
01:05:45,666 --> 01:05:48,790
Before I fled, I exposed them under the sun,

769
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,415
hoping they would be exterminated.

770
01:05:50,875 --> 01:05:54,290
But in a rush, I'm not sure if they died out.

771
01:05:54,458 --> 01:05:56,540
So where did you keep the fire turtles?

772
01:05:57,208 --> 01:06:01,290
It's where Infinity Monastery is now.

773
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:03,999
You try to frame Infinity Monastery

774
01:06:04,166 --> 01:06:05,332
You're mongering rumours. Let me kill you now.

775
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:06,415
Jing'er,

776
01:06:07,333 --> 01:06:10,040
the Chaplain can help this case.

777
01:06:10,875 --> 01:06:12,082
Can you tell him

778
01:06:14,625 --> 01:06:16,207
I want to talk to him?

779
01:06:16,375 --> 01:06:18,249
I want to ask the Chaplian face to face. . .

780
01:06:18,416 --> 01:06:20,499
why he wants me to handle the case.

781
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,040
The Chaplain is so powerful.

782
01:06:22,208 --> 01:06:24,540
Couldn't he just tell me who did it?

783
01:06:26,708 --> 01:06:29,540
The Chaplain is on spiritual sabbatical.

784
01:06:31,375 --> 01:06:32,874
Then I'll go to the Monastery to find him.

785
01:06:33,166 --> 01:06:35,707
Detective Dee, you can't just go there.

786
01:06:35,916 --> 01:06:36,999
I know,

787
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:40,790
without the Imperial Edict,
trespassers will be killed.

788
01:06:42,166 --> 01:06:44,915
Please tell the Chaplain I must see him,

789
01:06:46,291 --> 01:06:49,707
whether he wants to or not.

790
01:06:58,416 --> 01:06:59,749
You're swayed.

791
01:07:01,041 --> 01:07:03,915
How dare you help him pass the Chaplain a message?

792
01:07:08,125 --> 01:07:12,290
Apparently, Dee is at the end of his tether.

793
01:07:16,416 --> 01:07:17,832
No need to see him anymore.

794
01:07:18,666 --> 01:07:20,207
I'll handle it myself.

795
01:07:22,958 --> 01:07:28,790
Remember! To achieve greatness,
everyone is expendable!

796
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:32,415
One needs to be committed absolutely.

797
01:07:45,291 --> 01:07:47,790
If fire turtles are found in the Monastery,

798
01:07:49,166 --> 01:07:51,915
then the Chaplain has to be involved.

799
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,499
But what's the Chaplain's murder motive?

800
01:07:56,125 --> 01:07:59,332
Both men moved the amulets before they died.

801
01:07:59,791 --> 01:08:02,999
I don't believe in divine intervention,

802
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:05,457
but there might be a clue behind the amulets.

803
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,957
Xue moved it during investigation;

804
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:14,040
Jia moved them while inspecting the Buddha.

805
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:16,415
I think during his inspection,

806
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:18,290
Jia must have found something.

807
01:08:18,458 --> 01:08:19,874
The clue...

808
01:08:20,208 --> 01:08:22,165
may be in Jia's inspection diagram.

809
01:08:23,291 --> 01:08:25,582
We have to find this diagram.

810
01:08:41,541 --> 01:08:43,665
Pei of Supreme Court welcomes the Prince!

811
01:08:52,583 --> 01:08:55,957
Detective Dee, receive the mace. . .

812
01:09:15,833 --> 01:09:18,457
The late Emperor gave you this weapon.

813
01:09:19,125 --> 01:09:20,457
It was confiscated when you were in jail.

814
01:09:20,625 --> 01:09:24,332
After I got hold of it, I've kept it for you!

815
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:29,207
I give you back as I hope you still
respect the late Emperor.

816
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:32,832
Dee, I'm bestowing this mace on you.

817
01:09:33,291 --> 01:09:36,082
If I make mistakes in my rule in future,

818
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:40,874
you should advise me frankly with this mace.

819
01:09:44,583 --> 01:09:46,582
The Empress has informers everywhere.

820
01:09:47,666 --> 01:09:49,082
And you are returning the mace to me in public.

821
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:51,124
You want the Empress...

822
01:09:51,541 --> 01:09:53,582
to suspect me?

823
01:09:55,666 --> 01:09:58,915
My agreement with the Empress
is for investigation only.

824
01:09:59,125 --> 01:10:02,207
Power struggle is none of my concern.

825
01:10:06,291 --> 01:10:09,999
The bitch was right to put you in jail.

826
01:10:10,458 --> 01:10:12,290
You've become an obedient dog.

827
01:10:13,958 --> 01:10:17,249
Dee, do you know how the late Emperor died?

828
01:10:22,666 --> 01:10:26,915
The Empress ordered the Chaplain to kill him!

829
01:10:37,375 --> 01:10:39,624
Detective Dee!

830
01:10:42,083 --> 01:10:44,540
Get up! Detective Dee!

831
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:47,040
I've won!

832
01:10:49,125 --> 01:10:51,040
You Highness, you've won this time!

833
01:10:51,208 --> 01:10:53,624
No matter how good Dee is, he can't beat you!

834
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:56,290
He kneeled before you after all.

835
01:10:56,458 --> 01:10:58,082
Detective Dee is a talent.

836
01:10:58,625 --> 01:11:01,874
- Instead of crushing him, we can win him over.
- That's right.

837
01:11:02,041 --> 01:11:03,540
But some of our people believe

838
01:11:03,833 --> 01:11:07,999
he's a threat and must be eliminated.

839
01:11:09,416 --> 01:11:12,499
Nonsense! So short-sighted!

840
01:11:13,541 --> 01:11:15,790
Who needs force to subdue Detective Dee?

841
01:11:16,875 --> 01:11:20,582
To win without fighting, what do you need?

842
01:11:21,333 --> 01:11:22,457
Here!

843
01:12:27,458 --> 01:12:32,457
Since you're here, why not show up?

844
01:12:52,458 --> 01:12:55,665
This is the mace the late Emperor gave you?

845
01:12:56,166 --> 01:12:57,665
What's so special about it?

846
01:12:57,833 --> 01:12:59,790
It can detect the crack in a weapon.

847
01:13:00,583 --> 01:13:01,582
How?

848
01:13:01,916 --> 01:13:04,290
By hitting the enemy's weapon with this mace,

849
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:06,415
you can hear the crack...

850
01:13:08,166 --> 01:13:10,665
When you strike it, it will break!

851
01:13:30,208 --> 01:13:33,790
Men have weak points like weapons.

852
01:13:34,166 --> 01:13:35,582
They will break when struck.

853
01:13:37,625 --> 01:13:41,290
Dee, this is your last chance!

854
01:13:44,416 --> 01:13:45,374
Your Majesty,

855
01:13:45,875 --> 01:13:47,749
please answer me facing this mace.

856
01:13:49,375 --> 01:13:50,957
How did the late Emperor die?

857
01:14:04,958 --> 01:14:06,874
You still suspect me after all?

858
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,040
As reported, he died of liver disease.

859
01:14:11,208 --> 01:14:15,082
Contrary to rumors, I didn't poison him!

860
01:14:16,583 --> 01:14:18,874
I'm ascending the throne on Heaven's Mandate.

861
01:14:19,375 --> 01:14:22,957
But since I'm a woman, I'm being vilified.

862
01:14:30,125 --> 01:14:31,874
You know why I came to see you?

863
01:14:33,291 --> 01:14:35,415
To dissuade me from going to the Monastery.

864
01:14:37,041 --> 01:14:40,374
The Monastery is the Chaplain's retreat.

865
01:14:40,791 --> 01:14:43,624
And it is also where the spiritual energy
of our Kingdom lies.

866
01:14:43,875 --> 01:14:45,790
Nobody ever dared to disturb it.

867
01:14:46,708 --> 01:14:49,082
I order you not to investigate the Monastery!

868
01:14:51,166 --> 01:14:52,915
The Chaplain is on spiritual sabbatical.

869
01:14:54,041 --> 01:14:55,249
After my coronation,

870
01:14:55,708 --> 01:14:58,540
he will leave the palace.

871
01:14:59,458 --> 01:15:01,124
There's no need to visit him.

872
01:15:02,125 --> 01:15:05,249
Will the Chaplain vanish forever?

873
01:15:06,708 --> 01:15:08,540
Master Dee

874
01:15:09,416 --> 01:15:10,207
Something bad happened.

875
01:15:11,375 --> 01:15:14,165
Who is it? Get down and say your visiting purpose.

876
01:15:16,708 --> 01:15:17,707
I'm Pei from Supreme Court.

877
01:15:18,125 --> 01:15:19,665
Her Majesty has ordered

878
01:15:19,875 --> 01:15:21,165
the visitor to see her immediately.

879
01:15:23,875 --> 01:15:25,665
Please report to me directly.

880
01:15:27,166 --> 01:15:30,290
Pei from Supreme Court
humbly welcomes the Empress.

881
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:33,874
What's so urgent that
you have to report at midnight?

882
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:35,290
I've just received the news that

883
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:40,040
the Prince... was poisoned to death. . .
in his residence.

884
01:15:44,708 --> 01:15:46,082
Detective Dee has fled!

885
01:15:47,333 --> 01:15:48,499
Archers! Move Quickly!

886
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:51,582
He's gone to the roof top! Outflank him!

887
01:15:53,083 --> 01:15:55,249
Go arrest him and the rest stay for the Empress.

888
01:15:55,416 --> 01:15:56,540
Yes.

889
01:16:01,625 --> 01:16:03,707
I think during his inspection,

890
01:16:03,916 --> 01:16:05,124
Jia must have found something.

891
01:16:05,291 --> 01:16:06,624
The major clues of this case

892
01:16:06,791 --> 01:16:08,874
should be in Jia's inspection diagram.

893
01:16:10,208 --> 01:16:13,790
Madame Jia, I know you're in mourning,

894
01:16:13,958 --> 01:16:14,999
but our investigation is very urgent.

895
01:16:15,166 --> 01:16:16,415
My apologies for such a late visit.

896
01:16:16,583 --> 01:16:18,374
- Let's go. - Yes.

897
01:16:21,625 --> 01:16:23,499
Two days after my husband's death,

898
01:16:24,541 --> 01:16:26,040
a mysterious fire broke out

899
01:16:26,625 --> 01:16:29,707
and burnt down his whole study.

900
01:16:36,541 --> 01:16:37,540
Why didn't you report it?

901
01:16:37,791 --> 01:16:40,582
I have no idea about this.
Was I supposed to report it?

902
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:42,624
Of course, the cause of fire is suspicious.

903
01:16:43,083 --> 01:16:44,290
Someone wants to destroy the evidence.

904
01:16:44,833 --> 01:16:46,624
It's so important and you...

905
01:16:47,083 --> 01:16:51,540
- Madame...
- Madame...

906
01:16:57,916 --> 01:17:00,249
Is your residence being under renovation?

907
01:17:00,541 --> 01:17:02,999
There are leaks everywhere at the study.

908
01:17:03,291 --> 01:17:06,707
So, we're fixing the roof earlier.

909
01:17:06,875 --> 01:17:08,374
It's been going on for more than a month.

910
01:17:10,833 --> 01:17:11,665
More than a month?

911
01:17:13,666 --> 01:17:15,415
That means before Master Jia's accident,

912
01:17:15,916 --> 01:17:17,165
renovation has already begun.

913
01:17:17,833 --> 01:17:18,665
Correct.

914
01:17:20,583 --> 01:17:23,999
During the long renovation of the study,

915
01:17:24,166 --> 01:17:25,499
where did Master Jia work?

916
01:17:25,833 --> 01:17:27,874
He moved to the east wing for work.

917
01:17:28,458 --> 01:17:29,332
Show me the way.

918
01:19:54,125 --> 01:19:55,290
Detective Dee!

919
01:19:56,666 --> 01:19:59,624
You know it's a capital crime to come here.

920
01:19:59,875 --> 01:20:02,540
Why do you walk right into the trap?

921
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:06,582
But you Chaplain are such a lofty personage.

922
01:20:08,375 --> 01:20:09,915
Why do you need to resort

923
01:20:10,916 --> 01:20:13,207
to ventriloquism?

924
01:20:16,875 --> 01:20:20,332
Detective Dee! You tried all means to see me.

925
01:20:20,583 --> 01:20:24,124
Here I am. Say what you have to say.

926
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:28,624
I heard fire turtles were bred here.

927
01:20:28,833 --> 01:20:32,207
I must ascertain this for my investigation.

928
01:20:33,375 --> 01:20:34,165
Nonsense.

929
01:20:34,333 --> 01:20:35,415
I've been in retreat here for years.

930
01:20:35,583 --> 01:20:37,207
I've never seen any fire turtles.

931
01:20:37,625 --> 01:20:40,374
Leave right away and I'll spare your life.

932
01:20:41,583 --> 01:20:43,207
My life or death is still undetermined.

933
01:20:44,208 --> 01:20:47,082
But Jing'er, your life is in real danger.

934
01:20:48,125 --> 01:20:51,082
Am I right, Officer Shangguan?

935
01:20:54,791 --> 01:20:56,124
Under the Empress's instructions,

936
01:20:56,333 --> 01:20:57,332
you threw yourself into my arms

937
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:58,999
and tried to have sex with me.

938
01:20:59,333 --> 01:21:01,915
But you gave away the show unexpectedly.

939
01:21:02,166 --> 01:21:04,207
You wouldn't let me touch your acupoint...

940
01:21:04,416 --> 01:21:05,582
That smacked of transfiguration.

941
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:07,415
When I entered the Monastery just now,

942
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:10,207
You spoke for the deer with ventriloquism.

943
01:21:10,625 --> 01:21:13,082
Every time the deer appeared,

944
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:16,207
it's you who spoke for it, right, Jing'er?

945
01:21:16,375 --> 01:21:18,207
In Phantom Bazaar,

946
01:21:18,375 --> 01:21:20,165
you knew right away the Chaplain was a fake.

947
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:23,999
Is it because you're the same person?

948
01:21:30,166 --> 01:21:36,790
Jing'er, it's time to show your real face.

949
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,332
In order to ascend the throne,

950
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:07,207
the Empress eliminated clansmen and old officials.

951
01:22:07,541 --> 01:22:10,540
But she never knows that the Phantom Flame case
is so complicated.

952
01:22:10,833 --> 01:22:12,165
In order to crack the case,

953
01:22:12,375 --> 01:22:13,874
she even brought me back for it,

954
01:22:14,041 --> 01:22:16,999
never expecting that I would suspect her.

955
01:22:17,208 --> 01:22:19,165
She told me the Chaplain would disappear

956
01:22:19,333 --> 01:22:21,290
after her coronation.

957
01:22:22,375 --> 01:22:23,999
That's her way of doing things all along.

958
01:22:25,416 --> 01:22:28,415
To achieve greatness, everyone is expendable!

959
01:22:30,333 --> 01:22:31,165
Jing'er,

960
01:22:32,291 --> 01:22:33,874
You know too many of her secrets.

961
01:22:34,958 --> 01:22:38,082
Once the Chaplain's gone, what about Jing'er?

962
01:23:50,250 --> 01:23:51,207
It's ecstacy scent.

963
01:26:26,416 --> 01:26:27,415
Break!

964
01:26:50,208 --> 01:26:50,999
Remember!

965
01:26:51,916 --> 01:26:56,040
To achieve greatness, everyone is expendable!

966
01:27:40,416 --> 01:27:43,165
I told you not to come here but you did!

967
01:27:43,708 --> 01:27:45,499
Don't think I'll be grateful

968
01:27:45,916 --> 01:27:47,249
because you've taken the sword for me.

969
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:48,957
You smart ass!

970
01:28:23,541 --> 01:28:24,415
They should be snared!

971
01:28:25,375 --> 01:28:26,165
Where are they?

972
01:28:32,250 --> 01:28:33,249
Couldn't be far.

973
01:28:33,541 --> 01:28:34,374
Go find them!

974
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:54,749
You're awake.

975
01:28:56,708 --> 01:28:58,290
It's good you woke up.

976
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,249
Did I hurt you?

977
01:29:07,041 --> 01:29:09,957
Detective Dee, you're so pathetic.

978
01:29:10,916 --> 01:29:15,165
The world is so big, but you can't fit in.

979
01:29:16,458 --> 01:29:18,207
Why does everybody want to kill you?

980
01:29:19,541 --> 01:29:21,415
The Empress also asked me to kill you,

981
01:29:22,041 --> 01:29:24,540
but I cannot.

982
01:29:34,333 --> 01:29:36,082
Can you take me back?

983
01:29:49,625 --> 01:29:50,790
Your guess is right on track.

984
01:29:52,458 --> 01:29:54,540
The Empress set up Infinity Monastery

985
01:29:55,541 --> 01:29:57,999
to use the Chaplain to eliminate dissenters.

986
01:29:59,750 --> 01:30:02,832
At that time, we did kill many people.

987
01:30:03,333 --> 01:30:07,124
But we didn't cause the Phantom Flame!

988
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:10,332
The murderer will strike again.

989
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:16,207
You have to help the Empress!

990
01:30:16,541 --> 01:30:18,124
Find out who the real culprit is.

991
01:30:25,458 --> 01:30:27,624
Her Majesty is here!

992
01:30:30,333 --> 01:30:31,582
I humbly welcome Your Majesty.

993
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,832
Call the Imperial Physician! Hurry up!

994
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,040
Go find the Imperial Physician immediately!

995
01:30:51,875 --> 01:30:52,874
Yes, Your Majesty.

996
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,207
Stand down.

997
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:57,499
Yes.

998
01:30:58,291 --> 01:30:59,957
Call the Imperial Physician.

999
01:31:01,291 --> 01:31:05,165
Can I ask you one question, Your Majesty?

1000
01:31:06,833 --> 01:31:07,665
Go ahead.

1001
01:31:10,625 --> 01:31:13,207
Have you ever

1002
01:31:13,958 --> 01:31:16,415
loved one person in your life?

1003
01:31:22,458 --> 01:31:23,415
Yes.

1004
01:31:25,750 --> 01:31:28,332
But the price was too high.

1005
01:31:31,208 --> 01:31:32,207
So. . .

1006
01:31:34,833 --> 01:31:35,915
was it worth it?

1007
01:31:40,583 --> 01:31:41,874
Was it worth it?

1008
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:46,874
It's worth it.

1009
01:31:53,916 --> 01:31:58,915
Jing'er.

1010
01:33:17,625 --> 01:33:19,207
Detective Dee!

1011
01:33:30,458 --> 01:33:32,624
We don't have time. No need to untie me.

1012
01:33:33,208 --> 01:33:34,665
I know why Jia had to die.

1013
01:33:37,208 --> 01:33:39,457
I saw his inspection diagram.

1014
01:33:43,833 --> 01:33:44,957
That Buddha...

1015
01:33:45,291 --> 01:33:52,249
will be used to kill the Empress.

1016
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:53,165
Rein buckle. . .

1017
01:36:14,916 --> 01:36:18,999
With the righteous sky above me, I am fearless.

1018
01:36:24,791 --> 01:36:29,124
Like the sea waves,
the new always supersedes the old.

1019
01:36:40,041 --> 01:36:44,540
I am the only one who dare to challenge
the tradition.

1020
01:36:51,583 --> 01:36:52,582
You, the witch Empress

1021
01:36:53,875 --> 01:36:56,874
has upturned our whole Kingdom.

1022
01:36:58,541 --> 01:37:01,082
But I will be the one

1023
01:37:01,250 --> 01:37:04,124
who destroy all your venomous plans.

1024
01:37:06,333 --> 01:37:08,999
I know the winner takes it all.

1025
01:37:10,666 --> 01:37:14,374
And the heaven above will help me
fight for justice.

1026
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:16,415
Today

1027
01:37:17,083 --> 01:37:19,124
at day break

1028
01:37:20,208 --> 01:37:23,332
let's see how I combat with you.

1029
01:37:33,333 --> 01:37:34,207
It's the signal.

1030
01:37:38,791 --> 01:37:39,582
Let's start!

1031
01:38:10,250 --> 01:38:13,707
This is the inspection diagram by Master Jia.

1032
01:38:13,958 --> 01:38:16,249
Pei found it in Jia's residence.

1033
01:38:16,458 --> 01:38:19,707
Jia found out the Tubular Pillar is different
from the original design.

1034
01:38:22,166 --> 01:38:24,124
According to Jia's memorial before his death,

1035
01:38:25,625 --> 01:38:29,249
holes were found underneath all amulets.

1036
01:38:29,833 --> 01:38:32,957
Although he did not know the reason,

1037
01:38:33,458 --> 01:38:35,624
he was murdered nonetheless.

1038
01:38:41,458 --> 01:38:44,457
The Towering Buddha is 66 yards high,

1039
01:38:45,041 --> 01:38:49,832
overlooking the palace.
It can fall right upon the coronation stage

1040
01:38:51,083 --> 01:38:54,999
The Coronation Ceremony is the best timing.

1041
01:39:06,750 --> 01:39:09,790
Xue's death was a camouflage.

1042
01:39:09,958 --> 01:39:11,374
You wanted to divert our attention,

1043
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,915
linking the death to the amulets,

1044
01:39:14,750 --> 01:39:16,165
blaming it all on the Imperial Chaplain.

1045
01:39:19,166 --> 01:39:20,874
You also took advantage of our relationship,

1046
01:39:21,708 --> 01:39:23,707
preempting my every move.

1047
01:39:23,958 --> 01:39:26,624
Be it to Donkey Wang or to the Monastery,

1048
01:39:26,791 --> 01:39:28,207
you managed to set up ambushes beforehand.

1049
01:39:28,416 --> 01:39:29,415
So I am sure that

1050
01:39:29,916 --> 01:39:32,249
it's you who killed Jing'er outside the Monastery.

1051
01:39:34,708 --> 01:39:36,665
I would never underestimate your ability.

1052
01:39:38,083 --> 01:39:40,832
Dee, what more do you know about this?

1053
01:39:47,333 --> 01:39:50,999
Six years ago, you were the supervisor
when the Monastery was under renovation.

1054
01:39:52,375 --> 01:39:55,915
I discovered the remnants of the fire turtles
left by Donkey Wang.

1055
01:39:57,166 --> 01:39:58,374
Donglai was right.

1056
01:39:59,666 --> 01:40:02,915
The poison entered the body through water.

1057
01:40:03,791 --> 01:40:05,374
Jia drank the water

1058
01:40:05,541 --> 01:40:07,082
but Xue did not.

1059
01:40:08,916 --> 01:40:11,915
After he snatched the amulet,
he didn't drink any water.

1060
01:40:12,291 --> 01:40:15,249
So the poison must have come

1061
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:17,165
from outside.

1062
01:40:17,916 --> 01:40:20,457
The poison must have seeped through his body.

1063
01:40:25,333 --> 01:40:27,957
Dee, what else do you know?

1064
01:40:29,416 --> 01:40:32,457
Stop it, brother!

1065
01:40:33,083 --> 01:40:34,457
It's baneful to the empire and the people.

1066
01:40:35,125 --> 01:40:36,999
Don't make continuous mistakes.

1067
01:40:37,750 --> 01:40:39,040
Since 8 years ago,

1068
01:40:40,750 --> 01:40:41,999
I have made up mind long time ago.

1069
01:40:43,208 --> 01:40:45,082
I've only lived for one thing.

1070
01:40:51,416 --> 01:40:55,457
She gave me this; I have to repay her!

1071
01:41:11,125 --> 01:41:12,415
I know you will be back.

1072
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:22,124
Getting in here is easy but not going out.

1073
01:41:56,666 --> 01:41:57,540
Archers.

1074
01:41:59,166 --> 01:42:00,332
Kill him!

1075
01:42:58,583 --> 01:42:59,957
Tubular pillar...

1076
01:43:02,750 --> 01:43:03,749
Molten fluid. . .

1077
01:43:55,666 --> 01:43:58,457
8 years ago, you led a revolt against her.

1078
01:43:59,250 --> 01:44:00,749
Now you're giving your life for her.

1079
01:44:01,541 --> 01:44:03,415
Why did you go back on your words?

1080
01:44:03,583 --> 01:44:04,749
If you destroy the palace like this,

1081
01:44:05,208 --> 01:44:07,707
many more officials will be killed
at the same time.

1082
01:44:08,416 --> 01:44:10,415
So you'll be killing more than her.

1083
01:44:19,666 --> 01:44:20,665
Release the molten fluid!

1084
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:28,874
The die is cast.

1085
01:44:29,208 --> 01:44:30,915
The fluid will run into the tubular pillar

1086
01:44:31,125 --> 01:44:32,415
and melt its base.

1087
01:44:32,583 --> 01:44:34,040
The Buddha will fall upon the coronation stage.

1088
01:44:34,333 --> 01:44:36,999
No one will survive in the Palace.

1089
01:44:38,375 --> 01:44:40,124
I know you too well.

1090
01:44:40,291 --> 01:44:42,332
I heard you were brought back for the case,

1091
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,874
so I advised the Prince to kill you,

1092
01:44:46,416 --> 01:44:48,832
or you would ruin our plan.

1093
01:44:49,458 --> 01:44:51,457
But that old fool refused to listen.

1094
01:44:52,041 --> 01:44:53,665
He even called me a flunkey,

1095
01:44:54,333 --> 01:44:57,082
so I killed him.

1096
01:44:58,041 --> 01:45:00,790
1 00,000 soldiers are outside the city.

1097
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:02,582
Once the Buddha falls down,

1098
01:45:02,791 --> 01:45:05,082
they will enter the city to kill the bitch.

1099
01:45:08,375 --> 01:45:09,707
Even you can't survive this.

1100
01:45:22,250 --> 01:45:23,124
Break!

1101
01:46:38,250 --> 01:46:39,999
The fluid will run into the tubular pillar

1102
01:46:40,291 --> 01:46:41,415
and melt its base.

1103
01:46:41,583 --> 01:46:43,124
The Buddha will fall upon the coronation stage.

1104
01:46:43,416 --> 01:46:46,124
No one will survive in the Palace.

1105
01:46:49,541 --> 01:46:52,582
The time is ripe and Heaven has spoken.

1106
01:46:53,708 --> 01:46:58,790
Empress Wu is wise, gentle and generous.

1107
01:46:59,708 --> 01:47:03,790
For unification, she shall become Emperor.

1108
01:47:05,125 --> 01:47:08,290
Let this be known to the world!

1109
01:47:12,625 --> 01:47:15,665
Detective Dee. . . You can't get out!

1110
01:47:15,916 --> 01:47:16,957
Once the Buddha falls down,

1111
01:47:17,166 --> 01:47:18,874
I'll let you be buried with the bitch!

1112
01:47:42,666 --> 01:47:45,332
Shatuo, your plan has failed!

1113
01:48:09,416 --> 01:48:11,082
I can't stop the Buddha from collapsing,

1114
01:48:11,250 --> 01:48:13,707
but the fluid from the southwest has stopped.

1115
01:48:13,875 --> 01:48:15,874
The angle of the collapse will change.

1116
01:48:16,250 --> 01:48:17,957
It won't fall upon the coronation stage.

1117
01:48:18,125 --> 01:48:19,540
Oh!

1118
01:48:20,458 --> 01:48:22,040
I haven't failed!

1119
01:48:35,666 --> 01:48:38,165
After the Buddha has fallen,
the guards will be in panic!

1120
01:48:43,125 --> 01:48:45,874
I'll now go to the palace and kill her myself.

1121
01:49:37,500 --> 01:49:39,124
Shatuo! Give up!

1122
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:40,707
This is your last chance!

1123
01:50:44,875 --> 01:50:45,499
Your Majesty!

1124
01:50:45,666 --> 01:50:46,749
The Towering Buddha is wobbling.

1125
01:50:46,916 --> 01:50:47,957
It's falling towards the palace.

1126
01:50:48,125 --> 01:50:49,874
Please take shelter, your Majesty!

1127
01:50:51,708 --> 01:50:53,874
I'll go to see it.

1128
01:50:55,208 --> 01:50:57,832
How could this be happened?

1129
01:50:58,041 --> 01:50:59,540
Is it an omen?

1130
01:51:17,625 --> 01:51:19,957
Run! The Budda is collapsing!

1131
01:52:04,125 --> 01:52:06,957
I haven't failed

1132
01:52:12,166 --> 01:52:13,290
Go check what happened.

1133
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:14,457
Is it really collapsing?

1134
01:52:20,125 --> 01:52:22,540
Your Majesty, it's not safe here
and please leave at once.

1135
01:52:23,750 --> 01:52:24,624
Your Majesty!

1136
01:52:34,416 --> 01:52:35,707
Protect Her Majesty!

1137
01:52:35,958 --> 01:52:37,624
- Protect Her Majesty to leave here immediately!
- Protect Her Majesty

1138
01:52:38,875 --> 01:52:40,124
The Buddha is falling towards the palace.

1139
01:53:00,833 --> 01:53:01,832
Hey!

1140
01:53:02,166 --> 01:53:05,290
It's falling towards you. Don't go that way!

1141
01:53:48,208 --> 01:53:51,957
Go save the Emperor

1142
01:54:12,791 --> 01:54:14,374
It's Detective Dee who saved me. . .

1143
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,082
A rebel army is gathered 30 miles from here.

1144
01:54:19,416 --> 01:54:22,457
They will invade once the Buddha collapses.

1145
01:54:26,958 --> 01:54:28,790
Where's General Yao?

1146
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:29,999
Yau is here!

1147
01:54:30,791 --> 01:54:33,249
Report the situation outside the city!

1148
01:54:33,416 --> 01:54:34,874
60,000 Imperial Guards

1149
01:54:35,041 --> 01:54:37,249
were in ambush in Bianzhou before daybreak!

1150
01:54:38,083 --> 01:54:42,082
Call General Zhang to lead 1 00,000 soldiers

1151
01:54:42,250 --> 01:54:44,707
to attack the enemies in the east

1152
01:54:44,875 --> 01:54:46,915
until the rebels are totally demolished.

1153
01:54:47,083 --> 01:54:48,374
Yes, Your Majesty.

1154
01:54:55,916 --> 01:54:57,957
You were well prepared indeed.

1155
01:55:00,958 --> 01:55:01,957
Detective Dee,

1156
01:55:03,291 --> 01:55:06,499
from this day onwards,

1157
01:55:07,291 --> 01:55:09,540
the whole world shall know you're my savior.

1158
01:55:12,458 --> 01:55:14,124
May I venture to say a few words to you

1159
01:55:14,958 --> 01:55:17,957
in front of the mace?

1160
01:55:18,125 --> 01:55:20,124
Preposterous!

1161
01:55:20,958 --> 01:55:21,957
Stand down.

1162
01:55:22,250 --> 01:55:23,040
Your Majesty!

1163
01:55:24,291 --> 01:55:25,624
I asked you to stand down!

1164
01:55:26,666 --> 01:55:29,040
- Stand down, everybody! - Yes

1165
01:55:33,708 --> 01:55:36,957
Under Heaven, with this mace as the witness,

1166
01:55:38,333 --> 01:55:43,040
would the sacred Empress Wu please listen:

1167
01:55:46,666 --> 01:55:48,082
On the pretense of magic,

1168
01:55:48,500 --> 01:55:50,165
you wantonly killed clansmen and officials.

1169
01:55:50,708 --> 01:55:52,040
This is unpardonable!

1170
01:55:52,333 --> 01:55:54,165
But society is on the brink of extinction,

1171
01:55:54,333 --> 01:55:55,332
So your punishment is hereby suspended.

1172
01:55:56,250 --> 01:55:59,665
Ruling requires power and stratagems,

1173
01:56:00,166 --> 01:56:02,832
but right and wrong cannot be confused!

1174
01:56:03,166 --> 01:56:05,290
May the Emperor know her every move,

1175
01:56:06,166 --> 01:56:08,165
and let Tang clansmen succeed her,

1176
01:56:09,083 --> 01:56:10,874
so that everything will be back to track.

1177
01:56:14,708 --> 01:56:16,415
You called me "Emperor"?

1178
01:56:18,083 --> 01:56:21,665
Long live the Emperor! Long Live!

1179
01:56:29,916 --> 01:56:34,040
Officials are lazy; nobody can help me.

1180
01:56:35,375 --> 01:56:39,165
For the people, you stay and help me.

1181
01:56:39,458 --> 01:56:42,415
I've been in rebellion several times.

1182
01:56:43,541 --> 01:56:46,915
How dare I meddle with state affairs?

1183
01:56:51,041 --> 01:56:52,915
My assignment is over.

1184
01:56:54,041 --> 01:56:56,749
I'm returning this mace to the late Emperor.

1185
01:57:38,666 --> 01:57:40,165
The truth has come to light...

1186
01:57:40,458 --> 01:57:42,457
The world is at peace finally. . .

1187
01:57:44,416 --> 01:57:46,957
But Detective Dee is in Phantom Bazaar.

1188
01:57:50,083 --> 01:57:52,290
Whether your fire turtle poison is curable

1189
01:57:53,041 --> 01:57:54,790
will depend on the will of Heaven.

1190
01:57:55,583 --> 01:57:58,040
The will of Heaven is bright and clear,

1191
01:57:58,291 --> 01:58:01,332
but I'm travelling alone.

1192
01:58:01,958 --> 01:58:03,374
Heaven and Earth have no space for me,

1193
01:58:03,541 --> 01:58:05,582
but my heart is at peace.

1194
01:58:06,500 --> 01:58:08,749
