1
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
In 689 A.D.

2
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,082
upon Emperor Tang Gaozhong's death

3
00:01:15,832 --> 00:01:24,125
Empress Wu a regent for 7 years

4
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,248
would soon be coronated

5
00:01:27,582 --> 00:01:37,707
as history's first female emperor.

6
00:01:38,374 --> 00:01:42,581
Royal clansmen and founding officials

7
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,915
resented a woman usurping the throne

8
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:50,709
and colluded

9
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:54,165
to overthrow her reign.

10
00:01:54,498 --> 00:02:02,500
Behind its peaceful fa?
ade the capital was lurking with danger.

11
00:02:02,874 --> 00:02:09,748
All hell was about to break loose...

12
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:40,791
The Empress hereby decrees:

13
00:02:41,124 --> 00:02:45,748
The Court of State Ceremonials shall

14
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,832
welcome Umayyad diplomat Aspar

15
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:51,498
and escort him to the Towering Buddha

16
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,499
to revere the Empress's divine glory.

17
00:03:01,624 --> 00:03:03,623
This is Master Jia.

18
00:03:03,957 --> 00:03:08,249
The Buddha is sixty six yards high

19
00:03:08,624 --> 00:03:10,416
symbolizing the sixty sixth heaven

20
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,416
or the ninth cloud.

21
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:14,791
Please translate for the General.

22
00:03:15,082 --> 00:03:16,540
I already explained it to the General.

23
00:03:21,707 --> 00:03:24,708
The General asked if it be ready before the Coronation.

24
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:26,040
Sure

25
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:30,416
or my life cannot be spared.

26
00:03:39,748 --> 00:03:42,582
This is so spectacular!

27
00:03:42,874 --> 00:03:45,665
Huge resources have been spent on this.

28
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,457
2 million catties of metal were used.

29
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,083
More than 1000 catties are burnt each day.

30
00:03:50,374 --> 00:03:54,664
The temperature is too high here.

31
00:03:57,081 --> 00:04:00,165
Bring water and a towel for the General!

32
00:04:00,457 --> 00:04:05,457
Bring water and a towel for the General!

33
00:04:11,957 --> 00:04:13,998
( ###)

34
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,999
The General asked of whom the portrait is.

35
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:21,123
This is Lu Li our Imperial Chaplain.

36
00:04:21,498 --> 00:04:23,790
He's very potent and trusted by the Empress!

37
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:27,831
These are amulets bestowed by the Chaplain.

38
00:04:28,122 --> 00:04:29,582
They can dispel evil and thwart disaster...

39
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,497
Master Jia is here.

40
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,331
Is somebody going to speak with him?

41
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,832
What shall we do?

42
00:04:37,123 --> 00:04:39,665
We better speak up

43
00:04:39,956 --> 00:04:42,956
before lives are lost!

44
00:04:45,123 --> 00:04:47,248
Who should do that?

45
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:50,289
You go.

46
00:04:53,456 --> 00:04:55,832
Let's go up from here.

47
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:59,540
Today's so clear we can see miles from here!

48
00:05:01,747 --> 00:05:04,415
Lift him up.

49
00:05:11,997 --> 00:05:14,205
This tubular pillar

50
00:05:14,497 --> 00:05:16,539
is crucial to the Buddha.

51
00:05:16,831 --> 00:05:18,622
It's 82 yards long

52
00:05:18,913 --> 00:05:21,832
and made from one casting.

53
00:05:22,123 --> 00:05:24,165
It is surrounded by 81 steel chains.

54
00:05:24,456 --> 00:05:25,831
In the face of hurricanes or earthquakes,

55
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:27,539
the chains will pull in the opposite direction,

56
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,705
prevending the Buddha from collapsing.

57
00:05:28,956 --> 00:05:30,372
They're here. Mind your steps,

58
00:05:36,123 --> 00:05:37,248
General,

59
00:05:37,581 --> 00:05:41,663
these are the Buddha's two eyes.And here...

60
00:05:41,955 --> 00:05:43,539
Master Jia... Master Jia...

61
00:05:43,788 --> 00:05:44,413
What's the matter?

62
00:05:44,664 --> 00:05:46,580
Please go ahead...

63
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,997
What is it?

64
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:52,165
When you inspected the pillar yesterday,

65
00:05:52,414 --> 00:05:53,665
you removed some amulets.

66
00:05:53,913 --> 00:05:55,706
Should we put them back?

67
00:05:55,997 --> 00:05:57,997
They haven't been put back?

68
00:05:58,247 --> 00:06:00,955
Moving the amulets will bring bad luck,

69
00:06:01,247 --> 00:06:02,289
so...

70
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,372
after you have moved them,

71
00:06:04,623 --> 00:06:05,914
everybody is so scared...

72
00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:10,789
Our work has been stuck.

73
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,663
Put them back right away. Hurry up

74
00:06:26,289 --> 00:06:27,205
this way, please.

75
00:06:27,413 --> 00:06:29,497
Please...

76
00:06:30,914 --> 00:06:42,873
( ###)

77
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,831
He says we can see the coronation stage here.

78
00:06:46,164 --> 00:06:52,373
( ###)

79
00:06:52,622 --> 00:06:53,248
The General says...

80
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:06,914
Sir... Sir...

81
00:07:18,581 --> 00:07:20,788
Water! Hurry up!

82
00:08:29,121 --> 00:08:29,873
Master Xue.

83
00:08:30,122 --> 00:08:30,580
Huh?

84
00:08:30,788 --> 00:08:34,580
Sir, the corpse has been burnt to ashes.

85
00:08:34,831 --> 00:08:35,621
No flesh was left.

86
00:08:35,829 --> 00:08:37,913
Any forensic findings from the corpse?

87
00:08:42,413 --> 00:08:46,455
Sir! We found this on the corpse.

88
00:08:48,664 --> 00:08:50,829
Phosphorus!

89
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:54,620
The corpse is filled with it!

90
00:08:54,953 --> 00:08:57,662
In order to melt the copper,

91
00:08:57,955 --> 00:08:59,871
much phosphorus is left inside the Buddha.

92
00:09:00,204 --> 00:09:02,246
I bet this gave the murderer the opportunity

93
00:09:02,536 --> 00:09:06,079
to use what's already in the scene.

94
00:09:09,911 --> 00:09:13,996
Master Jia was burnt by yellow phosphorus!

95
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:15,371
No.

96
00:09:20,704 --> 00:09:25,079
The flame exploded from inside the body.

97
00:09:25,371 --> 00:09:29,205
Pei? How could the flame explode from inside?

98
00:09:29,495 --> 00:09:30,495
Sir, have a look.

99
00:09:30,746 --> 00:09:34,579
The bones were burnt to ashes.

100
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:37,495
Though there are ashes inside the shoe,

101
00:09:37,787 --> 00:09:39,329
its outside remains unscathed.

102
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,787
The flame must have been burnt from inside.

103
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:41,913
to make such remains.

104
00:09:42,163 --> 00:09:44,537
Perhaps!

105
00:09:44,787 --> 00:09:47,495
But the corpse is dense with phosphorus.

106
00:09:47,744 --> 00:09:50,537
Someone must have poisoned his food!

107
00:09:50,787 --> 00:09:52,328
Phosphorus stinks. He couldn't miss it.

108
00:09:52,579 --> 00:09:54,080
Even if he had taken it by mistake,the symptoms

109
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:57,912
should be shortness of breath and bodily pain.

110
00:09:58,161 --> 00:09:59,828
He shouldn't be aflame.

111
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:02,078
Cut the crap.

112
00:10:02,328 --> 00:10:06,329
The murderer is among you.

113
00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:08,579
Nab them all back for interrogation!

114
00:10:08,828 --> 00:10:22,079
Sir...Sir.

115
00:10:22,287 --> 00:10:24,870
You...the supervisor.

116
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,870
come to my front.

117
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:29,786
Sir...

118
00:10:30,037 --> 00:10:31,537
if you arrest me,our work will be delayed

119
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:33,161
and we're doomed.

120
00:10:33,412 --> 00:10:34,495
What's in your left hand?

121
00:10:39,869 --> 00:10:42,037
What is this?

122
00:10:42,286 --> 00:10:44,328
I was punished by the Ministry of Justice

123
00:10:47,412 --> 00:10:52,286
and had been jailed for eight years

124
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:56,120
for involving in Detective Dee's treason.

125
00:10:56,411 --> 00:10:58,495
Treason?

126
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:05,329
A dork like you in treason?

127
00:11:10,954 --> 00:11:14,829
Sir, if the Buddha can't be finished on time,

128
00:11:15,121 --> 00:11:16,995
the Empress will blame us.

129
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:19,786
Supreme Court won't be better off either.

130
00:11:19,828 --> 00:11:23,204
You dare to threaten us with the Empress?

131
00:11:23,454 --> 00:11:26,870
Good. I'll give you want you want.

132
00:11:29,454 --> 00:11:31,203
I'll chop your right hand off as well.

133
00:11:32,411 --> 00:11:34,786
He was struck by divine intervention!

134
00:11:35,077 --> 00:11:38,204
Master Jia was struck by divine intervention!

135
00:11:38,496 --> 00:11:39,996
Out of my way!

136
00:11:41,578 --> 00:11:44,995
What's this crap? Divine intervention?

137
00:11:46,703 --> 00:11:48,537
Master Jia...

138
00:11:48,787 --> 00:11:52,620
moved the amulets during
his inspection a few days ago.

139
00:11:54,454 --> 00:11:58,077
Amulets?

140
00:12:12,202 --> 00:12:14,953
Sir...

141
00:12:15,244 --> 00:12:16,953
What superstition!

142
00:12:16,995 --> 00:12:19,911
Divine intervention?

143
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:29,411
Let divine intervention strike me now!

144
00:12:29,702 --> 00:12:33,953
Nab all those who went to the top today

145
00:12:34,203 --> 00:12:35,869
and take them back to Supreme Court.

146
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:45,536
Donglai, you come with me to the Palace.

147
00:12:45,827 --> 00:12:47,287
Everybody else guards over here.

148
00:12:47,578 --> 00:12:49,620
This case is very important.

149
00:12:49,953 --> 00:12:53,243
I need to report to the Empress in person.

150
00:12:53,494 --> 00:12:53,994
Yes, Sir!

151
00:13:16,452 --> 00:13:19,536
Your Majesty, General Yao just entered,

152
00:13:19,828 --> 00:13:22,661
leading 200 soldiers from Longzhou.

153
00:13:22,911 --> 00:13:25,619
Following behind is General Qiu,

154
00:13:25,911 --> 00:13:28,661
with an army of 600 to protect Your Majesty.

155
00:13:31,785 --> 00:13:34,828
Your Majesty, Master Xue of Supreme Court

156
00:13:35,077 --> 00:13:36,285
and his subordinate Pei request an interview!

157
00:13:36,577 --> 00:13:37,744
Let them approach!

158
00:13:49,077 --> 00:13:52,368
Your Majesty, Pei Donglai of Supreme Court.

159
00:13:52,703 --> 00:13:55,161
Regarding the torched death of Jia Yi,

160
00:13:55,453 --> 00:13:56,910
my preliminary investigation indicates...

161
00:14:05,619 --> 00:14:10,202
Protect Her Majesty!

162
00:14:48,827 --> 00:14:50,868
The Empress hereby decrees:

163
00:14:51,119 --> 00:14:53,702
2000 more imperial guards shall

164
00:14:54,035 --> 00:14:55,992
be garrisoned inside the palace.

165
00:14:56,326 --> 00:14:58,159
Going in or out without permits

166
00:14:58,159 --> 00:14:59,744
is punishable by death without reprieve.

167
00:15:01,535 --> 00:15:04,035
All flames were replaced by night pearls.

168
00:15:04,369 --> 00:15:05,826
Even the stoves were extinguished!

169
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:07,951
All food and drinks came from outside...

170
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:10,284
The Empress has not eaten much.

171
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:11,409
She's probably still worried...

172
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:22,118
Your Majesty...Your Majesty.

173
00:15:24,285 --> 00:15:25,994
I'm not hungry!

174
00:15:26,327 --> 00:15:27,827
The coronation is imminent.

175
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:29,452
Your Majesty should mind your health.

176
00:15:29,744 --> 00:15:31,910
I've even ordered your favorite soup.

177
00:15:41,785 --> 00:15:44,785
You don't need to test-eat anymore.

178
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:46,575
Leave that to your subordinates.

179
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:49,743
Your Majesty has saved my life.

180
00:15:49,994 --> 00:15:54,368
I live and die for Your Majesty.

181
00:15:54,619 --> 00:15:57,911
Remember...

182
00:15:58,202 --> 00:16:00,243
you have to stay alive.

183
00:16:00,534 --> 00:16:04,534
Only then can you defeat your enemies.

184
00:16:04,868 --> 00:16:07,869
Since I entered the palace at the age of 14,

185
00:16:08,202 --> 00:16:10,243
I've braved through crises after crises.

186
00:16:10,535 --> 00:16:14,034
Had I been careless, I'd have been crushed

187
00:16:16,285 --> 00:16:20,159
and no woman would ever ascend the throne.

188
00:16:24,493 --> 00:16:26,617
Your Majesty, dinner is safe to eat.

189
00:16:40,784 --> 00:16:46,993
The Imperial Chaplain's Magic Deer is here.

190
00:16:55,366 --> 00:17:00,242
Everything is transient

191
00:17:00,575 --> 00:17:01,784
follow Heaven's Mandate.

192
00:17:02,076 --> 00:17:04,784
Welcome, Chaplain.

193
00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:07,367
Everyone, on your knees!

194
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,076
Yes, Your Majesty.

195
00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:12,700
The astronomical phenomena
have been chaotic.

196
00:17:12,992 --> 00:17:14,909
An evil availed of my spiritual sabbatical

197
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:17,826
to disturb the royal soil against nature.

198
00:17:17,826 --> 00:17:20,908
Would the Chaplain please enlighten me?

199
00:17:21,242 --> 00:17:23,034
The evil has been committing crimes

200
00:17:23,367 --> 00:17:25,867
as Venus has left the Palace for 8 years.

201
00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:29,117
It's being locked up and has not returned.

202
00:17:29,409 --> 00:17:33,700
Locked up? Is Venus a prisoner?

203
00:17:34,033 --> 00:17:39,076
Venus originated from Yang Qui of Di City.

204
00:17:39,409 --> 00:17:42,076
Left the Palace for 8 years?

205
00:17:42,368 --> 00:17:43,993
Originated from Dee City?

206
00:17:44,326 --> 00:17:47,449
Does the Chaplain mean Detective Dee?

207
00:17:47,783 --> 00:17:51,242
8 years ago, Dee opposed your regency

208
00:17:51,576 --> 00:17:52,991
and was jailed for treason.

209
00:17:53,284 --> 00:17:54,867
If we release him,

210
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,660
the dissenters will become more recalcitrant!

211
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,326
Please think twice, Your Majesty.

212
00:17:59,617 --> 00:18:02,449
As soon as Venus has returned,

213
00:18:02,783 --> 00:18:07,367
chaos will end and all stars are at peace.

214
00:18:07,701 --> 00:18:13,491
Find out whether Dee is dead or alive?

215
00:18:16,993 --> 00:18:18,491
((##))

216
00:18:25,492 --> 00:18:27,326
Welcome, Officer Shangguan.

217
00:18:27,658 --> 00:18:29,784
((###))

218
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:31,324
Dong Jin of Jiang Nan reported that he wants to...

219
00:18:31,617 --> 00:18:33,616
The South needs 6,000 soldiers
to suppress the barbarians.

220
00:18:33,866 --> 00:18:34,992
Memorial to be transferred to Military Dept.

221
00:18:35,283 --> 00:18:36,492
The South also reported that...

222
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,784
the river flooding destroyed houses and farmlands.

223
00:18:39,075 --> 00:18:40,950
Memorial to be transferred to Public Works Dept.

224
00:18:43,616 --> 00:18:45,324
The South has been such a mess lately.

225
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:48,575
After the flood came the plague.

226
00:18:51,324 --> 00:18:53,450
Here come the memorials to the throne.

227
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,698
Hurry up and burn the memorials.

228
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:59,532
Stop nagging like a girl. Get to work!

229
00:19:01,699 --> 00:19:04,324
Memorials are prescriptions for the state.

230
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:07,366
We know the state's illness by reading them.

231
00:19:07,658 --> 00:19:10,198
But the memorials in recent years show that

232
00:19:10,491 --> 00:19:12,532
people's livelihood has improved

233
00:19:12,824 --> 00:19:13,824
and they are living in contentment.

234
00:19:15,907 --> 00:19:18,574
So what?

235
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:22,241
You really think you can get out of here?

236
00:19:22,532 --> 00:19:23,658
Ling...

237
00:19:23,824 --> 00:19:26,116
Yes...

238
00:19:27,949 --> 00:19:30,867
Perhaps it's time I left here.

239
00:19:31,075 --> 00:19:32,283
What are you talking about?

240
00:19:41,158 --> 00:19:45,366
Oh! I hear that! Quite a few men...

241
00:19:45,699 --> 00:19:49,657
You said if you were to leave here alive,

242
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,574
you might have to fight a big battle...

243
00:19:52,032 --> 00:19:53,741
A battle of life and death.

244
00:19:54,033 --> 00:19:55,283
Remember what I taught you?

245
00:19:55,574 --> 00:19:57,075
Got it!

246
00:20:41,075 --> 00:20:41,908
Push the cart!

247
00:21:10,282 --> 00:21:11,782
20cm to the left!

248
00:21:12,073 --> 00:21:13,574
1cm below!

249
00:21:13,824 --> 00:21:16,907
Do it again!

250
00:21:41,323 --> 00:21:43,866
Kill the assassins!

251
00:21:44,157 --> 00:21:45,949
Very quick! Very quick movement!

252
00:21:46,198 --> 00:21:47,198
Kill the assassins!

253
00:21:48,658 --> 00:21:50,364
Protect Her Excellency!

254
00:21:50,615 --> 00:21:51,366
Get lost!

255
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:56,282
Watch out! Someone's on the roof!

256
00:21:56,532 --> 00:21:59,282
Hidden arrows! Bend over!

257
00:22:00,991 --> 00:22:05,406
No, they are going to jump!

258
00:22:05,739 --> 00:22:09,323
Don't let the assassins flee! Nab them alive!

259
00:22:18,615 --> 00:22:20,615
They all died.

260
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:21,949
You follow me up!

261
00:22:22,198 --> 00:22:23,406
Don't let anyone flee, dead or alive!

262
00:22:23,657 --> 00:22:26,531
Yes!

263
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:32,365
You! Go after the archer on the roof!

264
00:22:32,573 --> 00:22:33,114
Yes!

265
00:22:37,073 --> 00:22:38,615
No need to chase.

266
00:22:38,865 --> 00:22:40,906
This is a maximum security prison,

267
00:22:41,198 --> 00:22:42,240
and yet they can come and go at ease.

268
00:22:42,657 --> 00:22:44,323
They must be abetted by someone inside.

269
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:46,990
Nonsense!

270
00:22:47,239 --> 00:22:50,156
How can the killers be our men?

271
00:22:50,532 --> 00:22:53,989
The killers from outside must
know someone from inside.

272
00:22:54,281 --> 00:22:56,448
These people are too powerful for you.

273
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,448
Perhaps not for her.

274
00:22:58,739 --> 00:23:01,614
This official is elegantly dressed

275
00:23:01,948 --> 00:23:02,864
with an impressing bearing.

276
00:23:03,156 --> 00:23:04,490
It doesn't look like you're from here.

277
00:23:04,782 --> 00:23:07,240
I bet you're from the Palace.

278
00:23:09,906 --> 00:23:14,823
No need.

279
00:23:15,031 --> 00:23:17,906
He's really blind.

280
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:22,406
Why did you feign blindness?

281
00:23:22,698 --> 00:23:25,364
The world is marked by misfortunes.

282
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:30,280
I tried to stay away but failed after all.

283
00:23:30,531 --> 00:23:34,906
If I'm blind like him

284
00:23:35,239 --> 00:23:36,739
I can be at peace.

285
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:38,281
Your prediction is right on track.

286
00:23:38,572 --> 00:23:40,697
You said the day that trouble found you

287
00:23:40,989 --> 00:23:42,697
would be the day you could leave jail.

288
00:23:42,948 --> 00:23:44,031
It's a pity we can't leave together.

289
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:47,322
I got nothing to do with the world outside.

290
00:23:47,573 --> 00:23:51,488
But you never manage to extricate yourself.

291
00:23:51,738 --> 00:23:54,613
Thanks for keeping me company all this time.

292
00:23:54,863 --> 00:23:56,905
We are beyond such formality.

293
00:23:57,197 --> 00:24:00,156
Perhaps you'll discover that being outside

294
00:24:00,364 --> 00:24:03,614
is not as free as being inside.

295
00:24:03,864 --> 00:24:07,613
You think I'm right?

296
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,613
Military examination in the year 689!

297
00:24:31,822 --> 00:24:35,864
On the right is Chen from Xiangzhou

298
00:24:36,073 --> 00:24:37,697
his weapon will be the iron rod.

299
00:24:37,906 --> 00:24:41,572
On the left is Yen from Yangzhou

300
00:24:41,865 --> 00:24:43,573
his weapon will be the meteor hammer.

301
00:24:43,781 --> 00:24:46,447
The tournament begins!

302
00:25:05,322 --> 00:25:07,697
Your Majesty, Dee has been brought here.

303
00:25:07,988 --> 00:25:10,906
You knew you're coming to see me,

304
00:25:11,156 --> 00:25:12,197
but you're still in prison clothes

305
00:25:12,405 --> 00:25:14,197
and you didn't even shave?

306
00:25:14,447 --> 00:25:17,156
Years ago when I opposed your regency,

307
00:25:17,405 --> 00:25:18,530
I had already been accused of treason.

308
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,365
Now that your coronation is imminent,

309
00:25:20,656 --> 00:25:22,447
even if I got out of these prison clothes,

310
00:25:22,698 --> 00:25:24,114
I might have to put them on again soon...

311
00:25:24,406 --> 00:25:25,072
So I decided not to change.

312
00:25:25,239 --> 00:25:25,905
Leave us alone.

313
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,572
Leave us alone. You too, Jing'er.

314
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:33,030
Yes, Your Majesty.

315
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:51,322
The Crown Prince was very little then.

316
00:25:51,614 --> 00:25:54,488
I helped him rule as an Empress Dowager.

317
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:55,821
What's wrong with that?

318
00:25:56,072 --> 00:25:58,238
And yet you had to oppose.

319
00:25:58,489 --> 00:25:59,822
During my rule for the last 8 years,

320
00:26:00,113 --> 00:26:03,073
the state is incorrupt and the people rich.

321
00:26:03,364 --> 00:26:06,529
Even the Prince begged me
in writing to ascend the throne.

322
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:09,863
What more can you say?

323
00:26:10,071 --> 00:26:11,696
Nothing.

324
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,989
You men are just not used to women in power.

325
00:26:16,238 --> 00:26:19,279
One can't be conservative in state matters

326
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:21,112
but has to reform constantly.

327
00:26:21,363 --> 00:26:22,655
Reform is good,

328
00:26:22,946 --> 00:26:26,071
but all new things will turn old one day.

329
00:26:26,363 --> 00:26:28,321
While the old are being replaced by the new,

330
00:26:28,613 --> 00:26:30,530
if that involves their lives as well,

331
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,780
then rebellions become inevitable.

332
00:26:32,072 --> 00:26:34,571
Not only men...even dogs will try to flee.

333
00:26:44,572 --> 00:26:46,904
Detective Dee is still Detective Dee.

334
00:26:47,195 --> 00:26:49,695
Your words are so hurtful to the ears.

335
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:59,445
That was your badge.

336
00:26:59,778 --> 00:27:01,487
I'm returning it to you.

337
00:27:01,778 --> 00:27:03,571
You shall be my Imperial Commissioner

338
00:27:03,863 --> 00:27:05,362
in charge of the Phantom Flame Case.

339
00:27:05,654 --> 00:27:07,696
You shall work with Supreme Court

340
00:27:08,029 --> 00:27:11,696
to crack the case before my coronation!

341
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:37,820
Why do you keep following me?

342
00:27:39,529 --> 00:27:41,487
Her Majesty knows you've suffered in jail

343
00:27:41,778 --> 00:27:44,195
and specifically ordered me to serve you.

344
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:46,613
You have such a murderous look.

345
00:27:46,862 --> 00:27:49,113
It must be a pain to be served by you!

346
00:27:56,987 --> 00:27:58,944
So lively here?

347
00:27:59,237 --> 00:28:00,529
There are more people inside the inn.

348
00:28:00,862 --> 00:28:02,820
The Prince of Lanya is having a banquet.

349
00:28:03,071 --> 00:28:05,446
Li Xiao commands an army of 100,000

350
00:28:05,737 --> 00:28:07,028
and is haughty because of his royal status.

351
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,527
He is at loggerheads with the Empress

352
00:28:08,778 --> 00:28:09,862
and has long intended to revolt.

353
00:28:10,154 --> 00:28:12,237
He must be involved in this case.

354
00:28:12,487 --> 00:28:14,320
You better check him out.

355
00:28:14,612 --> 00:28:16,111
Having the intention to revolt

356
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:17,612
does not mean he's involved in this case.

357
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:19,112
You better get it right.

358
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:27,987
These are your clothings before you were jailed.

359
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:32,153
Only my Dragon Taming Mace is missing.

360
00:28:32,445 --> 00:28:34,820
It's getting late.

361
00:28:35,111 --> 00:28:39,153
You want to stay here with me?

362
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:45,405
Have you forgotten?

363
00:28:45,613 --> 00:28:49,194
Her Majesty has ordered me to serve you.

364
00:28:53,487 --> 00:28:54,987
To serve me?

365
00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:14,861
Huh? What are you standing there for?

366
00:29:15,152 --> 00:29:17,528
Get me some water. I need to shave.

367
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:24,903
You call this service?

368
00:29:25,195 --> 00:29:29,278
Look at you! Neither male nor a...

369
00:29:29,569 --> 00:29:32,195
That's how you serve people?

370
00:29:32,445 --> 00:29:34,486
That's how I serve you!

371
00:29:55,818 --> 00:29:58,946
I've given you the blade.

372
00:29:59,195 --> 00:30:01,987
Come, shave for me.

373
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,487
The Empress asked you to serve me,

374
00:30:11,778 --> 00:30:13,195
but don't take it in face value.

375
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:17,403
She wants you to spy on me but also to test you...

376
00:30:17,695 --> 00:30:23,027
I'll report every word to Her Majesty.

377
00:30:24,654 --> 00:30:26,820
All right, let me tell you this.

378
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,069
She does not believe in anyone.

379
00:30:28,361 --> 00:30:30,903
If we really become together,

380
00:30:31,194 --> 00:30:33,570
her intense suspicion

381
00:30:33,861 --> 00:30:36,151
will turn her against you.

382
00:30:38,569 --> 00:30:40,028
Why do you stop shaving?

383
00:30:40,236 --> 00:30:41,320
My beard is not there...

384
00:30:41,569 --> 00:30:43,778
It's here.

385
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:53,236
I suggest you tell her we can't get along.

386
00:30:53,528 --> 00:30:55,736
That will set her mind at peace.

387
00:30:56,028 --> 00:31:00,487
Let me see if she is what you said she is.

388
00:31:14,027 --> 00:31:16,277
Don't make it difficult for yourself.

389
00:31:16,568 --> 00:31:20,735
If you don't want it, don't force yourself.

390
00:31:22,695 --> 00:31:25,320
But do you want it?

391
00:32:03,777 --> 00:32:04,694
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

392
00:32:04,985 --> 00:32:06,277
I gave you the whip. You still didn't get it?

393
00:32:57,694 --> 00:32:58,984
Don't touch me.

394
00:33:33,235 --> 00:33:38,901
There're assasins! Move and hide!

395
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:42,819
I've been waiting for you, Brother Dee.

396
00:33:43,109 --> 00:33:45,360
Why aren't you on your knees?

397
00:33:45,651 --> 00:33:49,735
I'm chasing suspects. No time for formality.

398
00:33:50,027 --> 00:33:51,693
What suspects are you chasing?

399
00:33:51,943 --> 00:33:55,068
The Phantom Flame was staged by the Chaplain

400
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:56,527
under the order of the Empress!

401
00:33:56,776 --> 00:33:59,027
She wants to usurp the throne

402
00:33:59,276 --> 00:34:01,443
and eliminate old officials like us.

403
00:34:01,735 --> 00:34:05,026
I'm occupied. See you later!

404
00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:08,151
Dee, receive the Military Tally!

405
00:34:08,444 --> 00:34:12,733
With this tally, you can deploy any troops.

406
00:34:13,068 --> 00:34:15,233
In view of your loyal nature,

407
00:34:15,527 --> 00:34:17,985
I'm inviting you to join my Army of Justice.

408
00:34:18,277 --> 00:34:20,235
I'm in command of 100,000 soldiers

409
00:34:20,484 --> 00:34:21,901
and have a fail-proof plan

410
00:34:22,109 --> 00:34:25,610
to overturn the evil empress!

411
00:34:25,901 --> 00:34:28,152
Assasins!

412
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:30,151
Protect the Duke!

413
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:33,610
That's outrageous, Li Xiao!

414
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,901
How dare you rave like that?

415
00:34:39,442 --> 00:34:40,734
I won't chat with you

416
00:34:40,901 --> 00:34:43,401
now that she's here.

417
00:34:43,651 --> 00:34:45,943
But remember,

418
00:34:46,235 --> 00:34:47,651
one of these days...

419
00:34:47,901 --> 00:34:51,485
you'll grovel before me

420
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,860
and take my orders.

421
00:34:54,109 --> 00:34:56,401
Remember!

422
00:34:56,651 --> 00:35:00,776
Grovel before me and take my orders...

423
00:35:01,026 --> 00:35:01,984
He's hopeless. Let's go.

424
00:35:02,234 --> 00:35:03,443
You will ruin your integrety!

425
00:35:09,651 --> 00:35:11,734
He must have ordered the kill just now.

426
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,817
Why kills me if he wants to buy me off?

427
00:35:14,067 --> 00:35:16,735
He wants you dead as he can't buy you off.

428
00:35:16,984 --> 00:35:24,277
No, he doesn't want me dead.

429
00:35:24,568 --> 00:35:28,192
It's someone else who does.

430
00:35:31,942 --> 00:35:35,025
The Empress hereby decrees:

431
00:35:35,317 --> 00:35:38,608
Mysterious cases are rampant lately.

432
00:35:38,901 --> 00:35:39,984
Theses are works of villains

433
00:35:40,234 --> 00:35:41,192
who are spreading fallacies to cheat people.

434
00:35:41,442 --> 00:35:43,317
I hereby appoint Dee as Imperial Commissioner

435
00:35:43,609 --> 00:35:45,275
to lead Supreme Court to solve the

436
00:35:45,524 --> 00:35:48,358
Phantom Flame Case

437
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:50,233
before my Coronation.

438
00:35:50,442 --> 00:35:50,984
I humbly receive the Imperial Edict.

439
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:56,775
Commissioner, you do have a unique style.

440
00:35:57,067 --> 00:35:58,858
You bring your bird out while on duty?

441
00:35:59,108 --> 00:36:01,441
Don't underestimate it.

442
00:36:01,691 --> 00:36:02,609
It can solve crime.

443
00:36:04,901 --> 00:36:06,899
Where's the sun so early in the morning?

444
00:36:11,399 --> 00:36:14,274
This is the mortuary. This way, please.

445
00:36:21,983 --> 00:36:24,649
The bird is afraid to go in.

446
00:36:24,899 --> 00:36:26,733
Find someone outside to take care of it.

447
00:36:39,482 --> 00:36:43,983
The deceased was Jia of the 4th rank,

448
00:36:44,274 --> 00:36:46,692
Vice Minister of Public Works.

449
00:36:46,983 --> 00:36:50,150
On the 17th day of the 8th month, 1-3pm...

450
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:54,191
he was self-burnt to ashes inside the Buddha,

451
00:36:54,232 --> 00:36:57,982
What do you think of this case?

452
00:37:05,149 --> 00:37:07,649
Go watch over the ''evidence'' outside.

453
00:37:10,024 --> 00:37:13,024
I was ordered to follow you closely.

454
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:15,857
You want to return this badge to the Empress?

455
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,400
Don't touch the evidence or get too close!

456
00:37:26,651 --> 00:37:28,651
Shut the door!

457
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:43,775
Keep reading.

458
00:37:45,109 --> 00:37:49,692
The deceased was Xue of the 3rd rank...

459
00:37:49,983 --> 00:37:50,858
Louder!

460
00:37:52,275 --> 00:37:55,025
The deceased was Xue...

461
00:38:03,149 --> 00:38:04,191
You can speak now.

462
00:38:10,274 --> 00:38:12,441
The murder technique is not human.

463
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:15,483
Cut the generality. You're not to the point.

464
00:38:15,816 --> 00:38:16,857
Who do you think it is?

465
00:38:18,733 --> 00:38:24,482
Rumor has it that the Chaplain Lu Li

466
00:38:24,816 --> 00:38:26,524
is on a murder spree before the Coronation.

467
00:38:35,025 --> 00:38:39,274
To set an example and warn the dissenters

468
00:38:39,482 --> 00:38:40,316
not to act rashly.

469
00:38:42,525 --> 00:38:44,565
Jia was sent by the Empress. Why killed him?

470
00:38:44,815 --> 00:38:47,149
She's unfathomable.

471
00:38:47,399 --> 00:38:49,815
I read Jia's memorials before.

472
00:38:50,108 --> 00:38:51,691
He inspected the Buddha every month.

473
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,398
The time-table for the Buddha is very tight.

474
00:38:53,732 --> 00:38:55,899
Wouldn't killing him hinder the Coronation?

475
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:02,232
You read Master Jia's memorials?

476
00:39:02,524 --> 00:39:05,024
I read memorials at the Liaison Office

477
00:39:05,024 --> 00:39:06,524
before they were burnt every day.

478
00:39:11,774 --> 00:39:13,941
Moving the amulet causes divine intervention.

479
00:39:14,232 --> 00:39:15,733
The Chaplain is killing with black magic.

480
00:39:15,983 --> 00:39:18,191
You believe all this nonsense?

481
00:39:18,441 --> 00:39:20,190
It's evident. Why can't I believe it?

482
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,482
You're lying.

483
00:39:22,606 --> 00:39:26,440
We both know the amulets are just a front.

484
00:39:26,648 --> 00:39:28,732
The murderer is trying to hide the truth.

485
00:39:30,691 --> 00:39:34,898
She's still spying on us.

486
00:39:35,148 --> 00:39:37,898
Let's play her.

487
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:46,815
According to your theory,

488
00:39:48,314 --> 00:39:51,690
you'll be promoted after Xue died.

489
00:39:51,981 --> 00:39:53,023
That makes you a suspect as well.

490
00:39:54,482 --> 00:39:59,607
Then why do you think I killed Master Jia?

491
00:40:01,231 --> 00:40:03,899
You killed Master Jia as a diversion.

492
00:40:04,148 --> 00:40:06,189
Your real target is your superior.

493
00:40:06,399 --> 00:40:08,107
That fits your hypothesis squarely.

494
00:40:11,023 --> 00:40:12,607
Perhaps your real goal

495
00:40:12,816 --> 00:40:14,773
is to thwart the Coronation.

496
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:18,897
Don't stop.

497
00:40:19,149 --> 00:40:21,230
I'm done...

498
00:40:21,524 --> 00:40:23,565
Start again till I ask you to stop.

499
00:40:25,439 --> 00:40:29,481
Twice already. There's nothing to read!

500
00:40:29,689 --> 00:40:35,356
The deceased Detective Dee
is fighting with Minister Pei.

501
00:40:36,564 --> 00:40:37,398
You're framing me!

502
00:40:44,355 --> 00:40:47,647
Didn't you ask us to play her?
I was acting. Couldn't you tell?

503
00:40:57,939 --> 00:40:59,899
Sir... the birdcage is on fire, Master Pei!

504
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:02,690
Sir... Sir...

505
00:41:02,732 --> 00:41:04,481
What's the matter?

506
00:41:04,732 --> 00:41:05,607
I don't know.

507
00:41:07,814 --> 00:41:08,813
Detective Dee!

508
00:41:09,064 --> 00:41:13,314
Your evidence is aflame like those officials.

509
00:41:13,605 --> 00:41:15,356
Let's go to the kitchen.

510
00:41:21,522 --> 00:41:23,313
What's for lunch?

511
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:25,273
Stir-fried cucumbers with snow lotus.

512
00:41:25,522 --> 00:41:26,772
Any chicken blood?

513
00:41:27,022 --> 00:41:28,189
Over there.

514
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,605
What's he doing?

515
00:41:29,855 --> 00:41:32,230
He probably found out why
the victims caught fire.

516
00:41:52,814 --> 00:41:58,648
Master Xue caught fire at 3-5pm

517
00:41:58,898 --> 00:42:01,147
when the sun descended towards the west.

518
00:42:02,356 --> 00:42:04,689
The Buddha was surrounded by shadows.

519
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,523
But once he's in the drill ground,
he started catching fire.

520
00:42:07,564 --> 00:42:09,731
because the drill ground was uncovered.

521
00:42:09,981 --> 00:42:13,815
So I infer that the sun triggers the poison!

522
00:42:22,064 --> 00:42:24,731
Let's stay away from this.

523
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,188
Watch out.

524
00:43:33,022 --> 00:43:33,855
Detective Dee!

525
00:43:34,104 --> 00:43:38,563
Fancy seeing you again before I die!

526
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:41,605
That's Fate.

527
00:43:42,063 --> 00:43:45,314
We're kept alive for a purpose.

528
00:43:51,271 --> 00:43:53,104
You're back in Supreme Court?

529
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:59,479
The Empress put me in charge
of the Phantom Flame Case.

530
00:44:01,272 --> 00:44:03,729
Dee's position is unclear.

531
00:44:03,938 --> 00:44:05,896
We can't let him dupe us.

532
00:44:06,147 --> 00:44:08,480
Let's join forces and watch over him.

533
00:44:09,395 --> 00:44:10,229
Join forces?

534
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,271
I work directly under the Empress.

535
00:44:12,564 --> 00:44:14,230
It's not up to you to make suggestions.

536
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:36,230
What's the matter?

537
00:44:37,687 --> 00:44:40,479
Before the accidents, both officials

538
00:44:40,771 --> 00:44:43,187
did one thing besides

539
00:44:43,438 --> 00:44:45,436
moving the amulets.

540
00:44:47,728 --> 00:44:49,230
What is it?

541
00:44:49,479 --> 00:44:51,438
Drinking water.

542
00:44:51,688 --> 00:44:56,438
They both drank the water here

543
00:44:56,729 --> 00:45:01,229
and they were killed by intaking that liquid poison.

544
00:45:03,104 --> 00:45:05,146
But that can't be!

545
00:45:05,479 --> 00:45:07,771
I was supposed to move the amulet first.

546
00:45:08,021 --> 00:45:09,479
Master Xue just happened to come before me.

547
00:45:09,729 --> 00:45:13,062
If the murderer killed because of the amulet,

548
00:45:13,311 --> 00:45:15,478
how did he know Master Xue would snatch it

549
00:45:15,728 --> 00:45:17,271
and poison the water beforehand?

550
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:21,647
It should have nothing to do with the water.

551
00:45:21,896 --> 00:45:26,103
You work directly under the Empress.

552
00:45:26,354 --> 00:45:28,479
Do you need to hear my humble opinion?

553
00:45:33,562 --> 00:45:34,896
After I was in jail,

554
00:45:35,145 --> 00:45:36,478
I kept professing my loyalty in writing.

555
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:38,603
Eventually the Empress pardoned me.

556
00:45:38,853 --> 00:45:40,895
I joined the Department of Public Works,

557
00:45:41,187 --> 00:45:43,021
in charge of repairing royal palaces.

558
00:45:43,312 --> 00:45:46,436
I was then made supervisor of the Buddha.

559
00:45:46,729 --> 00:45:49,563
In other words, I've been promoted.

560
00:45:54,645 --> 00:45:55,979
How magnificent!

561
00:45:56,228 --> 00:45:59,771
The Tubular Pillar in the Book of Fanyanna?

562
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:03,353
Yes, I was inspired

563
00:46:03,394 --> 00:46:05,311
by the Fanyanna Buddha.

564
00:46:05,603 --> 00:46:07,770
The pillar's base is 100 feet underground.

565
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:11,687
It can withstand earthquakes

566
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:13,354
and hurricanes.

567
00:46:15,771 --> 00:46:18,145
This is the top level of the Buddha.

568
00:46:20,521 --> 00:46:22,895
Master Jia died inside the Buddha's left eye.

569
00:46:31,312 --> 00:46:34,187
You were also re-enacting the case?

570
00:46:37,186 --> 00:46:40,646
After working under you for so many years,

571
00:46:40,855 --> 00:46:42,855
I've been used to case re-enactment.

572
00:46:44,311 --> 00:46:45,437
So what have you learnt?

573
00:46:47,312 --> 00:46:49,271
Fire turtles...

574
00:46:49,521 --> 00:46:51,812
What are fire turtles?

575
00:46:52,062 --> 00:46:55,020
You also read Book of Fanyanna.

576
00:46:55,353 --> 00:46:59,520
Remember the section on fire turtles?

577
00:46:59,812 --> 00:47:01,229
What?

578
00:47:01,479 --> 00:47:06,437
The most venomous beetles in Western Regions.

579
00:47:06,687 --> 00:47:08,313
They feed on yellow phosphorus

580
00:47:08,563 --> 00:47:10,145
and their bodies catch fire under the sun.

581
00:47:10,395 --> 00:47:13,186
So the beetles are related to the two deaths?

582
00:47:13,479 --> 00:47:16,812
I witnessed what happened that day.

583
00:47:17,103 --> 00:47:20,854
Only later did I think of the fire turtles.

584
00:47:21,146 --> 00:47:22,937
Stop it, Donglai!

585
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:27,144
You knew this clue all along.

586
00:47:27,478 --> 00:47:30,644
Why did you rant about divine intervention?

587
00:47:30,978 --> 00:47:33,645
As a menial

588
00:47:33,937 --> 00:47:37,271
I used my wit when threatened.

589
00:47:37,561 --> 00:47:39,853
To be honest, even if I'd told you my theory,

590
00:47:40,145 --> 00:47:44,270
given your wisdom, you wouldn't believe it.

591
00:47:45,437 --> 00:47:47,145
You son of a bitch!

592
00:47:47,437 --> 00:47:50,062
Calm down. I've known him for years.

593
00:47:50,353 --> 00:47:51,520
That's how he is.

594
00:47:55,436 --> 00:47:57,394
Come!

595
00:47:57,645 --> 00:48:00,479
Detain him for extreme torture later.

596
00:48:00,729 --> 00:48:01,520
Yes.

597
00:48:01,729 --> 00:48:02,395
Stop!

598
00:48:04,271 --> 00:48:05,061
Donglai.

599
00:48:05,395 --> 00:48:07,604
The Empress has asked me to lead the case.

600
00:48:07,895 --> 00:48:10,936
I can decide everything without intervention.

601
00:48:11,311 --> 00:48:12,311
All of you stand down!

602
00:48:13,811 --> 00:48:18,144
What other clues do you have? Spit it out!

603
00:48:18,352 --> 00:48:20,311
I'm only speculating.

604
00:48:20,602 --> 00:48:23,102
After all, fire turtles are not indigenous.

605
00:48:23,603 --> 00:48:25,020
For more details

606
00:48:25,228 --> 00:48:27,145
we need help...

607
00:48:27,353 --> 00:48:29,061
Phantom Bazaar.

608
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:33,186
What is Phantom Bazaar?

609
00:48:33,435 --> 00:48:39,228
It's a spooky pandemonium.

610
00:48:39,477 --> 00:48:43,728
High officials like you would never go there.

611
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:46,269
Shatuo...

612
00:48:48,436 --> 00:48:49,851
you still remember Donkey Wang?

613
00:48:49,893 --> 00:48:55,645
Luoyang City was built

614
00:48:55,894 --> 00:48:57,562
a thousand years ago.

615
00:48:57,812 --> 00:49:00,269
The old city subsided during Han Dynasty.

616
00:49:00,519 --> 00:49:03,019
A new city was built on top in Sui Dynasty.

617
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:05,728
The underground became

618
00:49:05,977 --> 00:49:07,311
a black market.

619
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:08,603
They call it Phantom Bazaar.

620
00:49:34,269 --> 00:49:35,811
Who ordered a boat?

621
00:49:36,062 --> 00:49:38,186
We ordered a boat to Dr Donkey Wang.

622
00:49:38,436 --> 00:49:39,518
You know the place?

623
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:41,518
Wang the Donkey with Scabies?

624
00:49:41,769 --> 00:49:47,268
Five silver coins. Nonrefundable!

625
00:50:27,977 --> 00:50:31,686
Anybody here?

626
00:50:46,226 --> 00:50:47,102
Hey!

627
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:51,352
You're still alive, Detective Dee?

628
00:50:51,352 --> 00:50:54,562
Scram! This is no place for official curs!

629
00:50:54,602 --> 00:50:56,352
I'm here to save you.

630
00:50:56,644 --> 00:51:00,435
Save me? No, I'm fine!

631
00:51:02,435 --> 00:51:03,811
I don't want trouble!

632
00:51:08,353 --> 00:51:09,853
Now that I'm here

633
00:51:10,102 --> 00:51:12,686
your good days are over.

634
00:51:12,893 --> 00:51:14,642
True.

635
00:51:14,894 --> 00:51:17,685
You always bring me troubles.

636
00:51:17,936 --> 00:51:20,185
I'm really so sorry.

637
00:51:20,436 --> 00:51:21,560
If you don't go, I'll go.

638
00:51:24,393 --> 00:51:26,643
I'll move house.

639
00:51:30,852 --> 00:51:33,518
Pei! Give me the money!

640
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:46,560
What do you want to know?

641
00:51:47,101 --> 00:51:48,393
Ever heard of fire turtles?

642
00:51:53,434 --> 00:51:58,101
Fire turtles? This creature...

643
00:51:58,394 --> 00:52:00,017
It has been reported that they're extinct.

644
00:52:00,309 --> 00:52:01,726
I have no idea.

645
00:52:01,977 --> 00:52:02,851
Could it be they exist in Central Plains?

646
00:52:03,101 --> 00:52:04,352
It's no use.

647
00:52:09,393 --> 00:52:12,851
You won't solve this case!

648
00:52:13,142 --> 00:52:13,976
Pay up!

649
00:52:14,226 --> 00:52:15,726
Don't worry.

650
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:17,518
Tell us first and I'll pay.

651
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:19,977
I'll only tell you after you've paid.

652
00:52:20,309 --> 00:52:22,101
What is it?

653
00:52:22,351 --> 00:52:24,685
I'll pay after you've told us.

654
00:52:26,642 --> 00:52:29,476
I'll only speak after you've paid.

655
00:52:34,934 --> 00:52:37,309
Stay away!

656
00:52:58,268 --> 00:52:59,726
There's somebody above!

657
00:53:05,309 --> 00:53:06,350
Hey, where's Detective Dee?

658
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:07,518
He's chasing Dr Wang!

659
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:05,683
It's the Imperial Chaplain!

660
00:55:05,933 --> 00:55:07,808
Impossible!

661
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:31,808
Split! Can't you split? Split!

662
00:56:08,101 --> 00:56:10,641
You get in first.

663
00:57:47,974 --> 00:57:49,806
Jing'er is in trouble! I'll help her!

664
00:58:13,014 --> 00:58:14,806
Donglai! Jing'er! Move!

665
00:58:31,556 --> 00:58:33,057
Who is he?

666
00:58:33,348 --> 00:58:35,432
Why does the Chaplain want to kill him?

667
00:58:35,724 --> 00:58:37,222
He's not the Chaplain!

668
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:38,181
How can you be so sure?

669
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:39,889
I've seen the Chaplain! I'm positive he is...

670
00:58:46,806 --> 00:58:49,306
Hey! The Chaplain is over there!

671
00:58:51,389 --> 00:58:52,890
It's he again!

672
00:59:00,764 --> 00:59:02,181
Donglai!

673
00:59:02,389 --> 00:59:03,182
Jing'er!

674
00:59:03,348 --> 00:59:03,931
That's diversion.

675
00:59:05,763 --> 00:59:07,139
But Jing'er is by herself...

676
00:59:07,430 --> 00:59:09,680
She wants to find his identity more than we.

677
00:59:10,014 --> 00:59:12,931
Their target is Wang. We need to protect him.

678
00:59:14,764 --> 00:59:16,765
Jing'er knows where to find us.

679
00:59:17,056 --> 00:59:19,139
Stop wasting time and follow me!

680
01:00:57,472 --> 01:00:58,098
Jing'er?

681
01:01:53,680 --> 01:02:03,429
Almighty infinity? Infinity Monastery?

682
01:02:22,055 --> 01:02:25,055
There's nobody here. Stop pretending.

683
01:02:27,096 --> 01:02:28,512
Take your pin out.

684
01:02:30,471 --> 01:02:32,720
I was fine down there.

685
01:02:33,012 --> 01:02:35,054
Why dragged me up?

686
01:02:35,346 --> 01:02:38,305
Speak up! Where can we find fire turtles?

687
01:02:38,596 --> 01:02:40,095
If I can crack this case,

688
01:02:40,388 --> 01:02:41,346
I'll help you get back to the Palace.

689
01:02:41,637 --> 01:02:43,930
To hell with it! Who wants to go back?

690
01:02:52,388 --> 01:02:56,178
I advise you not to take up this case!

691
01:02:56,470 --> 01:02:58,928
You can't mess with the people behind it.

692
01:02:59,304 --> 01:03:03,470
It can't be done... and then... and then...

693
01:03:04,930 --> 01:03:06,219
Your transfiguration

694
01:03:06,512 --> 01:03:09,137
makes you inarticulate.

695
01:03:09,429 --> 01:03:10,345
Let me see.

696
01:03:10,637 --> 01:03:12,595
Don't touch

697
01:03:12,929 --> 01:03:15,470
these two acupoints!

698
01:03:15,762 --> 01:03:17,595
They are anathema

699
01:03:17,888 --> 01:03:18,888
to transfiguration!

700
01:03:24,262 --> 01:03:25,804
Don't touch me!

701
01:03:26,096 --> 01:03:27,554
What's the matter?

702
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:29,638
Nothing. I thought of someone.

703
01:03:29,929 --> 01:03:32,346
Like you, she didn't let me touch her.

704
01:03:32,638 --> 01:03:33,928
Who?

705
01:03:35,887 --> 01:03:39,136
It's all right. It's Donglai.

706
01:03:54,679 --> 01:03:56,680
Who is he?

707
01:03:56,722 --> 01:03:59,471
The Imperial Physician, Wang Bo.

708
01:03:59,763 --> 01:04:03,096
A.K.A. Donkey Wang.

709
01:04:03,387 --> 01:04:05,012
He's Donkey Wang?

710
01:04:07,805 --> 01:04:10,930
Could that be the so-called transfiguration?

711
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:12,637
Well, it's my first time.

712
01:04:14,303 --> 01:04:16,595
That's petty stuff. What's so special?

713
01:04:16,887 --> 01:04:19,678
We wasted our whole evening on him.

714
01:04:20,011 --> 01:04:21,763
What's this piece of crap good for?

715
01:04:22,096 --> 01:04:25,179
Who is she? So arrogant!

716
01:04:25,513 --> 01:04:31,054
Officer Shangguan, the Empress's favorite.

717
01:04:31,387 --> 01:04:33,221
So you are Shangguan Jing'er?

718
01:04:33,595 --> 01:04:36,054
You are the Empress's bitch?

719
01:04:46,596 --> 01:04:49,387
Let go of me!

720
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:51,680
We need torture to make him talk!

721
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:54,678
A confession under torture is useless.

722
01:04:55,011 --> 01:04:57,054
Don't you know that it's torture

723
01:04:57,345 --> 01:04:59,303
which alienates people from the Empress

724
01:04:59,636 --> 01:05:01,429
and go against her?

725
01:05:05,846 --> 01:05:08,053
The fire turtles you're looking for

726
01:05:08,345 --> 01:05:10,970
were used for the late Emperor's asthenia.

727
01:05:11,261 --> 01:05:13,887
I heard about them

728
01:05:14,179 --> 01:05:15,596
from Western people

729
01:05:15,887 --> 01:05:19,303
and decided to use them to treat asthenia.

730
01:05:19,554 --> 01:05:20,928
I presented a memorial to the late Emperor.

731
01:05:21,219 --> 01:05:23,428
The late Emperor personally commanded

732
01:05:23,761 --> 01:05:27,054
Western merchants to present him 20 of them.

733
01:05:27,346 --> 01:05:28,636
We soon discovered that

734
01:05:28,927 --> 01:05:31,220
they had no medical value.

735
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,511
In fact, they were a very lethal poison.

736
01:05:33,844 --> 01:05:38,762
Once ingested, one would burn under the sun.

737
01:05:39,095 --> 01:05:40,220
That's the symptom of the Phantom Flame Case!

738
01:05:40,261 --> 01:05:41,971
After this failure

739
01:05:42,304 --> 01:05:44,261
I fled for my life.

740
01:05:45,761 --> 01:05:48,594
Before I fled, I exposed them under the sun,

741
01:05:49,219 --> 01:05:50,511
hoping they would be exterminated.

742
01:05:50,803 --> 01:05:54,386
But in a rush, I'm not sure if they died out.

743
01:05:54,678 --> 01:05:56,553
So where did you keep the fire turtles?

744
01:05:56,886 --> 01:06:01,636
It's where Infinity Monastery is now.

745
01:06:01,927 --> 01:06:05,095
You try to harm Infinity Monastery and the Chaplain.

746
01:06:05,137 --> 01:06:06,344
Let me kill you now.

747
01:06:06,636 --> 01:06:10,387
Jing'er, the Chaplain can help his case.

748
01:06:10,428 --> 01:06:12,512
Can you tell him

749
01:06:12,845 --> 01:06:14,677
I want to talk to him?

750
01:06:14,719 --> 01:06:16,219
What about?

751
01:06:16,594 --> 01:06:18,344
I want to know...

752
01:06:18,636 --> 01:06:20,719
why the Chaplain wants me to handle the case.

753
01:06:21,094 --> 01:06:22,385
The Chaplain is so powerful.

754
01:06:22,595 --> 01:06:24,803
Couldn't he just tell me who did it?

755
01:06:25,095 --> 01:06:29,802
The Chaplain is on spiritual sabbatical.

756
01:06:30,178 --> 01:06:32,969
Then I'll go to the Monastery to find him.

757
01:06:33,302 --> 01:06:36,428
Detective Dee, you can't just go there.

758
01:06:36,761 --> 01:06:39,136
I know, without the Imperial Edict,

759
01:06:39,469 --> 01:06:40,970
trespassers are punishable by death.

760
01:06:41,303 --> 01:06:45,176
Please tell the Chaplain I must see him,

761
01:06:45,512 --> 01:06:49,677
whether he wants to or not.

762
01:06:57,427 --> 01:07:00,260
You are wavered.

763
01:07:06,636 --> 01:07:12,427
Apparently, Dee is at the end of his tether.

764
01:07:15,551 --> 01:07:20,635
No need to see him anymore. I'll handle it.

765
01:07:22,343 --> 01:07:24,219
Remember!

766
01:07:24,468 --> 01:07:28,719
To achieve greatness, everyone is expendable!

767
01:07:29,011 --> 01:07:31,927
One needs to be committed absolutely.

768
01:07:46,968 --> 01:07:49,552
If fire turtles are found in the Monastery,

769
01:07:49,843 --> 01:07:51,676
then the Chaplain has to be involved.

770
01:07:52,010 --> 01:07:54,719
But what's the Chaplain's murder motive?

771
01:07:55,010 --> 01:07:58,551
Both men moved the amulets before they died.

772
01:07:58,843 --> 01:08:02,260
I don't believe in divine intervention,

773
01:08:03,509 --> 01:08:05,800
but there might be a clue behind the amulets.

774
01:08:06,051 --> 01:08:09,093
Xue moved it during investigation

775
01:08:09,385 --> 01:08:11,676
Jia moved them while inspecting the tubular pillar.

776
01:08:11,969 --> 01:08:14,345
I think during his inspection,

777
01:08:14,637 --> 01:08:15,927
Jia must have found something.

778
01:08:16,176 --> 01:08:20,135
The clue may be in Jia's inspection report.

779
01:08:20,469 --> 01:08:22,260
We have to find this report.

780
01:08:22,552 --> 01:08:25,636
I'll go to Jia's residence tonight.

781
01:08:42,387 --> 01:08:44,552
Pei of Supreme Court welcomes the Prince!

782
01:08:52,343 --> 01:08:56,053
Detective Dee, receive the mace...

783
01:09:15,093 --> 01:09:18,635
The late Emperor gave you this weapon.

784
01:09:19,010 --> 01:09:21,011
It was confiscated when you were in jail.

785
01:09:21,344 --> 01:09:24,885
After I got hold of it, I've kept it for you!

786
01:09:27,926 --> 01:09:31,885
Dee, I'm bestowing this mace on you.

787
01:09:32,260 --> 01:09:35,093
If I make mistakes in my rule in future,

788
01:09:35,384 --> 01:09:38,885
you should advise me frankly with this mace.

789
01:09:44,676 --> 01:09:46,135
The Empress has spies everywhere.

790
01:09:46,427 --> 01:09:51,302
You are returning the mace to me in public.

791
01:09:51,635 --> 01:09:53,551
You want the Empress to suspect me?

792
01:09:53,884 --> 01:09:57,052
I had an agreement with the Empress.

793
01:09:57,301 --> 01:09:58,218
I only care about the investigation.

794
01:09:58,509 --> 01:10:02,010
Power struggle is none of my concern.

795
01:10:07,884 --> 01:10:10,801
The bitch was right to put you in jail.

796
01:10:11,176 --> 01:10:12,677
You've become a different person.

797
01:10:12,968 --> 01:10:17,925
Dee, do you know how the late Emperor died?

798
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:28,134
The Empress ordered the Chaplain to kill him!

799
01:10:37,676 --> 01:10:39,801
Detective Dee!

800
01:10:41,968 --> 01:10:44,967
Get up! Detective Dee!

801
01:10:45,258 --> 01:10:47,175
I've won!

802
01:10:49,383 --> 01:10:51,509
You Highness, you've won this time!

803
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:53,842
No matter how good Dee is, he can't beat you!

804
01:10:54,092 --> 01:10:56,551
He kneeled before you after all.

805
01:10:56,884 --> 01:10:58,258
Detective Dee is a talent.

806
01:10:58,592 --> 01:11:01,966
Instead of crushing him, we can win him over.

807
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:03,925
But some people below believe

808
01:11:04,216 --> 01:11:05,717
he's a threat to our plan

809
01:11:05,967 --> 01:11:08,592
and must be eliminated.

810
01:11:08,842 --> 01:11:12,758
Nonsense! So short-sighted!

811
01:11:13,050 --> 01:11:16,050
Who needs force to subdue Detective Dee?

812
01:11:16,342 --> 01:11:20,759
To win without fighting, what do you need?

813
01:11:21,050 --> 01:11:22,301
Here!

814
01:11:22,676 --> 01:11:24,383
Yes... you are right.

815
01:11:28,925 --> 01:11:31,217
Assasins!

816
01:11:34,133 --> 01:11:35,342
What's wrong with his body?

817
01:11:38,425 --> 01:11:40,133
Look!

818
01:11:40,426 --> 01:11:41,633
The Prince...

819
01:12:26,883 --> 01:12:32,340
Since you're here, why not have a drink?

820
01:12:52,884 --> 01:12:55,717
This is the mace the late Emperor gave you?

821
01:12:55,966 --> 01:12:57,801
What's so special about it?

822
01:12:58,050 --> 01:13:00,507
It can detect the crack in a weapon.

823
01:13:00,758 --> 01:13:01,717
How?

824
01:13:01,925 --> 01:13:04,800
By hitting the enemy's weapon with this mace,

825
01:13:04,842 --> 01:13:06,591
you can hear the crack...

826
01:13:08,842 --> 01:13:10,759
When you strike it, it will break!

827
01:13:10,967 --> 01:13:13,632
Break!

828
01:13:30,424 --> 01:13:33,758
Men have weak points like weapons.

829
01:13:34,091 --> 01:13:35,717
They will break when struck.

830
01:13:37,675 --> 01:13:42,842
Dee, this is your last chance!

831
01:13:43,091 --> 01:13:45,508
Your Majesty,

832
01:13:45,799 --> 01:13:48,299
please answer me facing this mace.

833
01:13:48,508 --> 01:13:51,759
How did the late Emperor die?

834
01:14:04,091 --> 01:14:07,256
You still suspect me after all?

835
01:14:08,883 --> 01:14:11,632
As reported, he died of liver disease.

836
01:14:11,924 --> 01:14:15,467
Contrary to rumors, I didn't poison him!

837
01:14:15,758 --> 01:14:19,340
I'm ascending the throne on Heaven's Mandate.

838
01:14:19,674 --> 01:14:23,674
But since I'm a woman, I'm being vilified.

839
01:14:30,091 --> 01:14:33,257
You know why I came to see you?

840
01:14:33,590 --> 01:14:36,133
To dissuade me from going to the Monastery.

841
01:14:36,424 --> 01:14:40,132
The Monastery is the Chaplain's retreat.

842
01:14:40,423 --> 01:14:42,174
Nobody ever dared to disturb it.

843
01:14:42,507 --> 01:14:46,257
The murderer is trying to misguide
you and hurt our relationship.

844
01:14:46,549 --> 01:14:49,340
I order you not to investigate the Monastery!

845
01:14:49,631 --> 01:14:53,007
The Chaplain is on spiritual sabbatical.

846
01:14:53,299 --> 01:14:55,466
After my coronation,

847
01:14:55,799 --> 01:14:58,758
he will leave the palace.

848
01:14:59,091 --> 01:15:01,215
There's no need to visit him.

849
01:15:02,716 --> 01:15:05,257
Will the Chaplain vanish forever?

850
01:15:09,841 --> 01:15:12,133
Protect Her Majesty!

851
01:15:12,424 --> 01:15:13,923
Stop! Don't let him in!

852
01:15:14,215 --> 01:15:14,923
Who is this?

853
01:15:17,174 --> 01:15:18,007
I'm looking for Detective Dee.

854
01:15:23,423 --> 01:15:24,923
Protect the Empress!

855
01:15:34,881 --> 01:15:35,965
Your Majesty!

856
01:15:36,257 --> 01:15:37,090
Spit it out!

857
01:15:37,341 --> 01:15:40,048
The Prince...was poisoned
to death...in his residence.

858
01:15:45,798 --> 01:15:46,797
Detective Dee has fled!

859
01:15:47,090 --> 01:15:48,506
That way! He's gone that way!

860
01:15:48,797 --> 01:15:50,965
Go arrest him and the rest stay for the Empress.

861
01:16:10,090 --> 01:16:14,464
Madame Jia, I know you're in mourning,

862
01:16:14,798 --> 01:16:16,340
but our investigation is very urgent.

863
01:16:16,631 --> 01:16:19,256
My apologies for such a late visit.

864
01:16:21,215 --> 01:16:23,381
Two days after my husband's death,

865
01:16:23,673 --> 01:16:26,381
a mysterious fire

866
01:16:26,672 --> 01:16:29,381
burnt down his study.

867
01:16:36,672 --> 01:16:37,548
Why didn't you report it?

868
01:16:39,422 --> 01:16:41,006
Was I supposed to report it?

869
01:16:41,297 --> 01:16:43,006
Of course, the cause of fire is suspicious.

870
01:16:43,257 --> 01:16:44,631
Someone wants to destroy the evidence.

871
01:16:45,090 --> 01:16:47,048
It's so important and you...

872
01:16:48,422 --> 01:16:50,465
Madame...

873
01:16:58,173 --> 01:17:00,048
Is your residence being under renovation?

874
01:17:01,630 --> 01:17:05,630
It leaked earlier, so we're fixing the roof.

875
01:17:06,049 --> 01:17:07,381
It's been going on

876
01:17:07,672 --> 01:17:08,882
for more than a month.

877
01:17:10,464 --> 01:17:11,674
More than a month?

878
01:17:13,215 --> 01:17:15,673
That means before Master Jia's accident,

879
01:17:16,007 --> 01:17:17,255
renovation has already begun.

880
01:17:17,548 --> 01:17:18,590
Correct.

881
01:17:20,089 --> 01:17:24,257
Such a long renovation for a leak!

882
01:17:24,548 --> 01:17:25,715
So where did he work?

883
01:17:26,007 --> 01:17:28,214
He moved to the east wing for work.

884
01:17:28,505 --> 01:17:29,673
Show me the way.

885
01:19:30,921 --> 01:19:33,922
Don't move!

886
01:19:54,130 --> 01:19:55,547
Detective Dee!

887
01:19:55,837 --> 01:19:59,713
You know it's a capital crime to come here.

888
01:20:00,046 --> 01:20:02,672
Why do you walk right into the trap?

889
01:20:03,879 --> 01:20:06,505
For saving me from jail,

890
01:20:06,839 --> 01:20:08,005
I must thank you in person.

891
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:09,962
But you are such a lofty personage.

892
01:20:10,253 --> 01:20:12,046
Why do you need to resort

893
01:20:12,504 --> 01:20:14,047
to ventriloquism?

894
01:20:16,213 --> 01:20:20,379
Detective Dee! You tried all means to see me.

895
01:20:20,670 --> 01:20:24,254
Here I am. Say what you have to say.

896
01:20:24,545 --> 01:20:28,421
I heard fire turtles were bred here.

897
01:20:28,713 --> 01:20:32,588
I must ascertain this for my investigation.

898
01:20:32,796 --> 01:20:34,713
Nonsense.

899
01:20:34,962 --> 01:20:36,254
I've been in retreat here for years.

900
01:20:36,462 --> 01:20:37,796
I've never seen any fire turtles.

901
01:20:37,879 --> 01:20:40,671
Leave right away and I'll spare your life.

902
01:20:40,712 --> 01:20:43,254
My life or death is still undetermined.

903
01:20:43,504 --> 01:20:47,004
But Jing'er, your life is in real danger.

904
01:20:47,255 --> 01:20:51,253
Am I right, Officer Shangguan?

905
01:20:51,503 --> 01:20:56,253
Under the Empress's instructions,

906
01:20:56,503 --> 01:20:57,879
you threw yourself into my arms

907
01:20:58,087 --> 01:20:59,671
and tried to have sex with me.

908
01:20:59,963 --> 01:21:02,379
But you gave away the show unexpectedly.

909
01:21:02,630 --> 01:21:04,211
You wouldn't let me touch your acupoint...

910
01:21:04,461 --> 01:21:06,961
That smacked of transfiguration.

911
01:21:07,213 --> 01:21:08,837
When I entered the Monastery just now,

912
01:21:08,879 --> 01:21:10,795
You spoke for the deer with ventriloquism.

913
01:21:11,046 --> 01:21:12,837
Every time the deer appeared,

914
01:21:13,128 --> 01:21:16,213
it's you who spoke for it, right, Jing'er?

915
01:21:16,503 --> 01:21:18,462
In Phantom Bazaar,

916
01:21:18,712 --> 01:21:20,338
you knew right away the Chaplain was a fake.

917
01:21:20,587 --> 01:21:24,086
Is it because you're the same person?

918
01:21:24,379 --> 01:21:28,589
The Chaplain is Jing'er. Jing'er is him?

919
01:21:31,295 --> 01:21:36,796
Jing'er, it's time to show your real face.

920
01:22:04,546 --> 01:22:06,130
In order to ascend the throne, the Empress

921
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:08,256
eliminated clansmen and old officials,

922
01:22:08,463 --> 01:22:11,088
blaming everything on the Chaplain.

923
01:22:11,421 --> 01:22:13,296
In order to shut people's mouths,

924
01:22:13,588 --> 01:22:14,753
she even brought me back to solve the case,

925
01:22:15,046 --> 01:22:17,004
never expecting that I would suspect her.

926
01:22:17,295 --> 01:22:19,753
She told me the Chaplain would disappear

927
01:22:20,087 --> 01:22:22,087
after her coronation.

928
01:22:22,463 --> 01:22:24,128
That's her way of doing things all along.

929
01:22:24,503 --> 01:22:28,503
To achieve greatness, everyone is expendable!

930
01:22:30,712 --> 01:22:31,503
Jing'er,

931
01:22:31,755 --> 01:22:34,003
You know too many of her secrets.

932
01:22:34,379 --> 01:22:39,212
Once the Chaplain's gone, what about Jing'er?

933
01:23:50,336 --> 01:23:51,378
It's sleeping smoke.

934
01:26:27,503 --> 01:26:28,460
Break!

935
01:26:50,378 --> 01:26:51,627
Remember!

936
01:26:51,918 --> 01:26:56,086
To achieve greatness, everyone is expendable!

937
01:27:41,710 --> 01:27:44,668
I told you not to come here but you did!

938
01:27:47,292 --> 01:27:48,877
Don't think I'll be grateful

939
01:27:49,168 --> 01:27:49,917
because you've taken the sword for me.

940
01:27:50,251 --> 01:27:52,710
You smart ass!

941
01:28:20,375 --> 01:28:23,001
They should be snared!

942
01:28:24,126 --> 01:28:26,084
Where are they?

943
01:28:29,209 --> 01:28:30,000
Couldn't be far.

944
01:28:31,917 --> 01:28:34,834
Go find them!

945
01:28:54,084 --> 01:28:55,167
You're awake.

946
01:28:56,959 --> 01:28:58,625
It's good you woke up.

947
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:03,250
Did I hurt you?

948
01:29:06,042 --> 01:29:10,417
Detective Dee, you're so pathetic.

949
01:29:12,751 --> 01:29:15,500
The world is so big, but you can't fit in.

950
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:20,250
Everybody wants to kill you.

951
01:29:20,793 --> 01:29:24,125
The Empress also asked me to kill you,

952
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:26,875
but I cannot.

953
01:29:34,126 --> 01:29:36,458
Can you take me back?

954
01:29:49,625 --> 01:29:50,582
Your guess is right on track.

955
01:29:50,874 --> 01:29:54,167
The Empress set up Infinity Monastery

956
01:29:54,208 --> 01:29:59,916
to use the Chaplain to eliminate dissenters.

957
01:30:00,208 --> 01:30:05,249
At that time, we did kill many people.

958
01:30:05,541 --> 01:30:09,166
But we didn't cause the Phantom Flame!

959
01:30:09,459 --> 01:30:13,834
The murderer will strike again.

960
01:30:15,459 --> 01:30:19,916
You have to help the Empress!

961
01:30:20,376 --> 01:30:22,792
Find out who the real culprit is.

962
01:30:26,709 --> 01:30:28,416
Be gentle and careful.

963
01:30:45,375 --> 01:30:48,208
Call the Imperial Physician! Hurry up!

964
01:30:48,499 --> 01:30:49,208
Call the Imperial Physician immediately!

965
01:30:52,001 --> 01:30:52,792
Yes, Your Majesty.

966
01:30:54,292 --> 01:30:55,624
Stand down.

967
01:30:55,916 --> 01:30:56,500
Stand down.

968
01:31:01,666 --> 01:31:05,667
Can I ask you one question, Your Majesty?

969
01:31:06,916 --> 01:31:07,918
Go ahead.

970
01:31:09,498 --> 01:31:11,999
Have you ever loved one person

971
01:31:12,374 --> 01:31:15,958
in your life?

972
01:31:22,666 --> 01:31:23,250
Yes.

973
01:31:24,457 --> 01:31:28,083
But the price was too high.

974
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:41,999
Was it worth it?

975
01:31:45,124 --> 01:31:47,208
It's worth it.

976
01:33:15,873 --> 01:33:19,791
Detective Dee!

977
01:33:30,999 --> 01:33:33,041
We don't have time. No need to untie me.

978
01:33:33,332 --> 01:33:35,040
I know why Jia had to die.

979
01:33:37,289 --> 01:33:39,663
I saw his inspection diagram.

980
01:34:04,955 --> 01:34:10,414
Rein buckle...

981
01:37:38,664 --> 01:37:39,412
Let's start!

982
01:37:39,662 --> 01:37:40,454
Yes!

983
01:38:09,788 --> 01:38:13,455
This is the inspection diagram

984
01:38:13,871 --> 01:38:14,746
Pei found in Jia's residence.

985
01:38:15,079 --> 01:38:17,080
According to Jia's last report,

986
01:38:17,372 --> 01:38:19,871
the Tubular Pillar is different.from the original design.

987
01:38:22,287 --> 01:38:25,622
According to Jia's memorial before his death,

988
01:38:25,913 --> 01:38:29,245
holes were found underneath all amulets.

989
01:38:29,538 --> 01:38:31,912
Although he did not know the reason,

990
01:38:32,163 --> 01:38:35,246
he was murdered nonetheless.

991
01:38:41,537 --> 01:38:44,830
The Towering Buddha is 66 yards high,

992
01:38:45,205 --> 01:38:49,037
overlooking the palace.
It can fall right upon the coronation stage.

993
01:38:49,370 --> 01:38:52,412
The Coronation Ceremony is the best timing.

994
01:39:06,704 --> 01:39:09,746
Xue's death was a camouflage.

995
01:39:10,121 --> 01:39:11,080
You wanted to divert our attention,

996
01:39:11,371 --> 01:39:13,621
linking the death to the amulets,

997
01:39:13,912 --> 01:39:16,079
blaming it all on the Imperial Chaplain.

998
01:39:19,121 --> 01:39:21,413
You also took advantage of our relationship,

999
01:39:21,746 --> 01:39:24,204
preempting my every move.

1000
01:39:24,496 --> 01:39:27,204
Be it to Donkey Wang or to the Monastery,

1001
01:39:27,579 --> 01:39:29,704
you managed to set up ambushes beforehand.

1002
01:39:30,037 --> 01:39:32,579
And you killed Jing'er outside the Monastery.

1003
01:39:34,246 --> 01:39:36,788
What a thorough analysis!

1004
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:41,037
You're indeed the ''Extraordinary Detective''!

1005
01:39:46,871 --> 01:39:51,830
Six years ago, you were the supervisor
when the Monastery was under renovation.

1006
01:39:52,205 --> 01:39:55,578
I discovered the remnants
ofthe fire turtles left by Donkey Wang.

1007
01:39:55,912 --> 01:39:58,705
Donglai was right.

1008
01:39:59,038 --> 01:40:03,246
The poison entered the body through water.

1009
01:40:03,580 --> 01:40:05,663
Jia drank the water but Xue did not.

1010
01:40:05,996 --> 01:40:07,579
After he snatched the amulet,

1011
01:40:07,870 --> 01:40:12,579
he didn't drink any water.

1012
01:40:12,871 --> 01:40:16,454
So the poison must have come

1013
01:40:16,746 --> 01:40:18,204
from outside.

1014
01:40:18,453 --> 01:40:20,413
The poison must have seeped through his body.

1015
01:40:24,870 --> 01:40:28,411
Incredible!

1016
01:40:31,621 --> 01:40:33,787
Stop it, brother!

1017
01:40:34,079 --> 01:40:34,995
It's baneful to the empire and the people.

1018
01:40:35,328 --> 01:40:37,246
Don't make continuous mistakes.

1019
01:40:37,537 --> 01:40:39,746
Since 8 years ago,

1020
01:40:41,203 --> 01:40:45,412
I've only lived for one thing.

1021
01:40:51,703 --> 01:40:55,662
She gave me this I have to repay her!

1022
01:41:33,953 --> 01:41:35,828
Release them!

1023
01:42:59,536 --> 01:43:01,369
Tubular pillar...

1024
01:43:03,326 --> 01:43:06,368
Molten fluid...

1025
01:43:48,827 --> 01:43:50,453
Break!

1026
01:43:55,286 --> 01:43:58,786
8 years ago, you led a revolt against her.

1027
01:43:59,077 --> 01:44:00,911
Now you're giving your life for her.

1028
01:44:01,203 --> 01:44:03,578
Where's your integrity?

1029
01:44:03,827 --> 01:44:04,785
She might be an evil,

1030
01:44:04,993 --> 01:44:07,786
but you'll be killing more than her.

1031
01:44:08,078 --> 01:44:10,453
What kind of monster have you become?

1032
01:44:19,577 --> 01:44:20,786
Release the molten fluid!

1033
01:44:21,036 --> 01:44:21,577
Yes!

1034
01:44:27,202 --> 01:44:28,952
The die is cast.

1035
01:44:29,244 --> 01:44:31,244
The fluid will run into the tubular pillar

1036
01:44:31,494 --> 01:44:32,452
and melt its base.

1037
01:44:32,701 --> 01:44:34,036
The Buddha will fall upon the coronation stage.

1038
01:44:34,286 --> 01:44:36,535
No one will survive in the Palace.

1039
01:44:38,535 --> 01:44:40,702
I know you too well.

1040
01:44:40,952 --> 01:44:42,993
I heard you were brought back for the case,

1041
01:44:43,285 --> 01:44:46,119
so I advised the Prince to kill you,

1042
01:44:46,369 --> 01:44:49,160
or you would ruin our plan.

1043
01:44:49,452 --> 01:44:52,034
But that old fool refused to listen.

1044
01:44:52,285 --> 01:44:54,410
He even called me a flunkey,

1045
01:44:54,660 --> 01:44:57,743
so I killed him.

1046
01:44:57,994 --> 01:45:00,285
Now I have his tally in my hand.

1047
01:45:00,618 --> 01:45:02,244
100,000 soldiers are outside the city.

1048
01:45:02,536 --> 01:45:03,868
Once the Buddha falls down,

1049
01:45:04,201 --> 01:45:05,576
they will enter the city to kill the bitch.

1050
01:45:07,952 --> 01:45:10,327
Even you can't survive this.

1051
01:45:20,743 --> 01:45:23,492
Break!

1052
01:46:37,575 --> 01:46:39,158
The fluid will run into the tubular pillar

1053
01:46:39,449 --> 01:46:40,576
and melt its base.

1054
01:46:40,825 --> 01:46:42,284
The Buddha will fall upon the coronation stage.

1055
01:46:43,784 --> 01:46:46,159
No one will survive in the Palace.

1056
01:46:50,535 --> 01:46:54,242
The time is ripe and Heaven has spoken.

1057
01:46:54,492 --> 01:47:01,492
Empress Wu is wise, gentle and generous.

1058
01:47:01,825 --> 01:47:06,409
For unification, she shall become Emperor.

1059
01:47:06,659 --> 01:47:11,117
Let this be known to the world!

1060
01:47:12,408 --> 01:47:16,076
Detective Dee... You can't get out!

1061
01:47:16,368 --> 01:47:18,534
I'll let you be buried with the bitch!

1062
01:47:42,700 --> 01:47:45,532
Shatuo, your plan has failed!

1063
01:48:09,034 --> 01:48:11,742
I can't stop the Buddha from collapsing,

1064
01:48:12,034 --> 01:48:13,866
but the fluid from the southwest has stopped.

1065
01:48:14,199 --> 01:48:16,283
The angle of the collapse will change.

1066
01:48:16,533 --> 01:48:18,284
It won't fall upon the coronation stage.

1067
01:48:18,575 --> 01:48:22,285
Oh! I won't give up!

1068
01:48:33,908 --> 01:48:35,117
I haven't failed. I haven't.

1069
01:48:35,409 --> 01:48:38,409
After the Buddha has fallen,
the guards will be in panic!

1070
01:48:38,699 --> 01:48:40,117
I haven't failed!

1071
01:48:42,450 --> 01:48:46,325
Wait and see. I haven't failed!

1072
01:48:57,741 --> 01:48:59,491
Open the door!

1073
01:49:02,993 --> 01:49:04,491
It's collapsing!

1074
01:49:04,741 --> 01:49:05,825
Run!

1075
01:49:37,740 --> 01:49:39,408
Shatuo! Give up!

1076
01:49:39,741 --> 01:49:40,992
This is your last chance!

1077
01:50:44,031 --> 01:50:45,907
Your Majesty!

1078
01:50:46,198 --> 01:50:47,324
The Towering Buddha is wobbling.

1079
01:50:47,615 --> 01:50:48,490
It's falling towards the palace.

1080
01:50:48,781 --> 01:50:50,033
Please take shelter, your Majesty!

1081
01:52:05,405 --> 01:52:09,281
I haven't failed.

1082
01:52:16,532 --> 01:52:18,073
It's really collapsing!

1083
01:52:18,532 --> 01:52:21,282
Your Majesty!
We can't stay here. Let's leave right now.

1084
01:52:21,532 --> 01:52:22,282
Your Majesty!?

1085
01:52:23,365 --> 01:52:24,615
Your Majesty!

1086
01:52:35,282 --> 01:52:39,866
Protect Her Majesty!Please leave immediately!

1087
01:53:03,906 --> 01:53:05,073
Hey! Don't run that way!

1088
01:53:46,490 --> 01:53:47,907
Go save the Emperor

1089
01:53:48,157 --> 01:53:50,572
Your Majesty!?

1090
01:53:50,823 --> 01:53:52,322
Let's go over there.

1091
01:54:04,781 --> 01:54:08,530
Your Majesty!

1092
01:54:10,905 --> 01:54:14,614
It's Detective Dee who saved me...

1093
01:54:16,363 --> 01:54:19,073
A rebel army is gathered 30 miles from here.

1094
01:54:19,322 --> 01:54:22,655
They will invade once the Buddha collapses.

1095
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:28,947
Where's General Yao?

1096
01:54:29,238 --> 01:54:30,446
Yau is here!

1097
01:54:30,781 --> 01:54:33,114
Report the situation outside the city!

1098
01:54:33,406 --> 01:54:35,363
60,000 imperial guards

1099
01:54:35,656 --> 01:54:37,613
were in ambush in Bianzhou before daybreak!

1100
01:54:37,906 --> 01:54:42,320
Call General Zhang to lead 100,000 soldiers

1101
01:54:42,571 --> 01:54:45,238
to attack the enemies in the east

1102
01:54:45,529 --> 01:54:47,363
until the rebels are totally demolished.

1103
01:54:47,614 --> 01:54:48,780
Yes, Your Majesty.

1104
01:54:55,406 --> 01:54:58,113
You were well prepared indeed.

1105
01:54:59,405 --> 01:55:02,447
Detective Dee,

1106
01:55:02,780 --> 01:55:06,781
from this day onwards,

1107
01:55:07,156 --> 01:55:09,821
the whole world shall know you're my savior.

1108
01:55:12,779 --> 01:55:13,989
May I venture to say a few words to you

1109
01:55:15,487 --> 01:55:18,113
in front of the mace?

1110
01:55:18,321 --> 01:55:20,280
Preposterous!

1111
01:55:20,571 --> 01:55:21,905
Stand down.

1112
01:55:22,156 --> 01:55:24,779
Your Majesty!

1113
01:55:25,029 --> 01:55:26,154
I asked you to stand down!

1114
01:55:26,613 --> 01:55:27,988
Stand down, everybody!

1115
01:55:33,779 --> 01:55:36,987
Under Heaven, with this mace as the witness,

1116
01:55:37,321 --> 01:55:43,238
would the sacred Empress Wu please listen:

1117
01:55:46,737 --> 01:55:48,737
On the pretense of magic,

1118
01:55:49,112 --> 01:55:50,571
you wantonly killed clansmen and officials.

1119
01:55:50,945 --> 01:55:52,363
This is unpardonable!

1120
01:55:52,779 --> 01:55:55,363
But society is on the brink of extinction,

1121
01:55:55,696 --> 01:55:57,196
So your punishment is hereby suspended.

1122
01:55:57,571 --> 01:56:00,155
Ruling requires power and stratagems,

1123
01:56:00,446 --> 01:56:03,070
but right and wrong cannot be confused!

1124
01:56:03,403 --> 01:56:05,529
May the Emperor know her every move,

1125
01:56:05,863 --> 01:56:08,571
and let Tang clansmen succeed her,

1126
01:56:08,946 --> 01:56:10,572
so that everything will be back to track.

1127
01:56:14,821 --> 01:56:16,404
You called me ''Emperor''?

1128
01:56:16,737 --> 01:56:21,445
Long live the Emperor! Long Live!

1129
01:56:30,238 --> 01:56:33,945
Officials are lazy nobody can help me.

1130
01:56:34,237 --> 01:56:39,029
For the people, you stay and help me.

1131
01:56:39,405 --> 01:56:42,447
I've been in rebellion several times.

1132
01:56:42,739 --> 01:56:46,904
How dare I meddle with state affairs?

1133
01:56:49,779 --> 01:56:52,988
My assignment is over.

1134
01:56:53,321 --> 01:56:56,904
I'm returning this mace to the late Emperor.

1135
01:57:37,070 --> 01:57:39,113
The truth has come to light...

1136
01:57:39,446 --> 01:57:42,778
The world is at peace finally...

1137
01:57:43,112 --> 01:57:47,030
But Detective Dee is in Phantom Bazaar.

1138
01:57:48,696 --> 01:57:52,320
Whether your fire turtle poison is curable

1139
01:57:52,695 --> 01:57:54,779
will depend on the will of Heaven.

1140
01:57:55,070 --> 01:57:57,154
The will of Heaven is bright and clear,

1141
01:57:57,487 --> 01:57:58,321
but I'm travelling alone.

1142
01:57:58,696 --> 01:58:00,030
Heaven and Earth have no space for me,

1143
01:58:00,404 --> 01:58:02,070
but my heart is at peace.

1144
01:58:06,195 --> 01:58:09,613
The sun is up. Let's go down.

1145
01:58:37,778 --> 01:58:38,404
In 690 A.D.,

1146
01:58:38,612 --> 01:58:39,153
Empress Wu became the first and only

1147
01:58:39,362 --> 01:58:40,278
female emperor in the history of China.

1148
01:58:43,238 --> 01:58:46,195
15 years later, in 705 A.D.,

1149
01:58:46,486 --> 01:58:48,486
Empress Wu retired from the throne,

1150
01:58:48,861 --> 01:58:50,695
returning the title to the Crown Prince,

1151
01:58:51,070 --> 01:58:54,654
in honor of her promise to Detective Dee.
