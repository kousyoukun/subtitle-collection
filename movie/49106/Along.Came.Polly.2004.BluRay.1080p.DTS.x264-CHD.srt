1
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:49,674
I, Reuben, take you, Lisa...

2
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:57,181
I, Reuben, take you, Lisa,
to be my lawfully wedded wife.

3
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:00,017
I do.

4
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:06,274
- Lois, the room looks beautiful.
- Thanks.

5
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:09,402
The candles have been replaced
by the mini-lamps you asked for.

6
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:12,405
- So no fire hazard.
- Great. Did we sanitize these?

7
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,408
The best man is in the house!

8
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,828
- Oh, my God!
- Sandy, are you okay?

9
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,080
Jorgé, ice. The best man went down.

10
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:22,874
Dance floor's a Slip 'N Slide, dude.

11
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,876
I thought I told them
not to wax this.

12
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,254
23% of the guests are over 70.
I don't want anyone breaking a hip.

13
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,214
Don't worry,
I'm gonna take care of it.

14
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,633
I analyze risk for a living.
It's my job to worry.

15
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:35,887
Let me do the worrying,
because you got to get married.

16
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,430
I'm good.

17
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40,641
You got my note that Harry Bard
at table 7's allergic to seafood?

18
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:42,685
His chicken will go nowhere
near the fish.

19
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,021
We're putting the finishing touches
on the cake.

20
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,731
This looks great.
Lisa is gonna love it.

21
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:47,190
This looks great.
Lisa is gonna love it.

22
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:48,483
Hit me, dude.

23
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:58,242
Aren't you that kid
from Crocodile Tears?

24
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:00,286
That's right. I'm Sandy Lyle.

25
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,246
I saw that movie in high school.

26
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:04,207
That bagpipe scene
was the funniest shit.

27
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,918
We had a good time on that picture.
Want an autograph?

28
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:08,127
No, thanks.

29
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:12,048
It's good to see you, man.
I thought you died 15 years ago.

30
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,426
Ah! Nah.

31
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:18,429
I'm very much alive.
I've been stage-acting.

32
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:20,181
- Getting back to my roots.
- We should...

33
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,350
They're making
an E! True Hollywood Story on me.

34
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:23,476
That'll clear up questions.

35
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,478
They're really doing a show
about your life?

36
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,939
I got a camera crew
following me the next few weeks.

37
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:29,857
- It's gonna be huge.
- Cool!

38
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:32,318
Reuben! Two-minute warning.
Lisa's on her way down.

39
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,486
Thanks.

40
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,404
- Look, Reuben.
- Yeah?

41
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:37,281
I'm asking you this

42
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,408
because you're my oldest friend
in the world.

43
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,370
- And I'm your wingman.
- Okay. What?

44
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:46,290
Are you sure you want to do this?

45
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,503
Sandy, there's not a doubt
in my mind.

46
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,505
Okay?

47
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,883
I found the perfect woman.
We're totally in love.

48
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,679
My life's working out
just like I planned.

49
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,639
Let's go get married.

50
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,393
Mazel tov!

51
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,770
Go on. Kiss each other.

52
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,443
Big smile, everyone!

53
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:16,571
Come on, you love each other.

54
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,239
Smile, Grandma.

55
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,700
Having fun.

56
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,794
Hello, everybody.
I'm Stan Indursky, Reuben's boss.

57
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,546
Thank you. You're very kind.

58
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,799
Now Reub's not the sort of fellow
to brag about his own success

59
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,801
so I'm going to do it for him.

60
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,803
The fact is this young man here,

61
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,806
is the best
risk assessment expert

62
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:47,059
in this whole meshugaas
we call the insurance business.

63
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:49,979
Irving, Vivian,
you've raised a wonderful son.

64
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:51,731
Let's hear it for him.

65
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,275
Reuben, Lisa, let me just say...

66
00:03:56,486 --> 00:04:00,323
that I would insure your marriage
any day of the week.

67
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:03,075
Mazel, you two. Good things.

68
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,915
Oh, and, Lisa, don't tire him out
too bad on the honeymoon.

69
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,459
I need this kid fresh
when he gets back.

70
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,629
Mazel! Good things.

71
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,172
You know, the truth is,

72
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:19,300
I've been waiting for this day
my entire life.

73
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,260
About four-and-a-half years ago

74
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:24,096
I met a real-estate agent
named Lisa Kramer...

75
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:27,016
who showed me an apartment,
which I rented...

76
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,517
just so she'd go out with me.

77
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:32,104
- I gave him a good price.
- Not good enough. She's a killer.

78
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,773
No, seriously...

79
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:37,026
after about a month of dating,
I knew she was the one.

80
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,279
And I couldn't be happier

81
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:43,866
that on this day that I've been
dreaming about for so long...

82
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:47,328
the woman I'm standing next to
is you.

83
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,189
Oh, my goodness!

84
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,985
- Look at this place!
- I lost my shoe!

85
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,737
- So pretty!
- It's beautiful.

86
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,072
What?

87
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,251
- How's your bruise?
- It's okay.

88
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:38,004
You know, it's a little sore.

89
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,672
They really should tell you...

90
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,258
if they let Komodo dragons
run around the hotel.

91
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,592
Really.

92
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,096
Oh!

93
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,849
- How about this one?
- Let's see.

94
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:54,478
"Recently renovated colonial
in Montclair, three-bedroom..."

95
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,523
Sweetie, we took a virtual tour
of this one on the Internet.

96
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,900
It was perfect,
but just a little pricey.

97
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:01,861
Oh, right. That's right.

98
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,739
It's probably off the market anyway.

99
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:07,658
- Why do you say that?
- Because I bought it.

100
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,828
You what?

101
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,289
I bought it!

102
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:21,505
Reuben, I'm in shock.
You don't do things like that.

103
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,008
- You love it, right?
- I do, but, Reuby...

104
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:27,303
- We have a house!
- Oh, my God, we have a house! Honey!

105
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:28,304
Hi. Hello.

106
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:29,597
Hi. Hello.

107
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,558
How's it going?

108
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:36,228
It's going great. Thank you.

109
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,314
I see you gang
are new to the island,

110
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,232
I want to come have a meet with you.

111
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:43,652
I show you my boat. That is
my boat there on the sandbar.

112
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:46,489
It's very big.

113
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:48,574
Yeah, it's pretty good size.

114
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,577
So, tell me true,
are you guys for scuba?

115
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,080
What does that mean?

116
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:57,083
I'm the unofficial scuba king
of St. Barts.

117
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,668
So if you're for scuba,
I take you out on the boat,

118
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:03,255
I show you the coral reef
and we have like a scuba party?

119
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:07,176
That sounds great, but we're not
certified, so we'll have to pass.

120
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:09,762
That is no biggie.
I get you resort-certified...

121
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,180
couple of hours.

122
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,849
- I have always wanted to try it.
- Yeah?

123
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,977
Good. My name is Claude.
What is you guys' name?

124
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:20,106
My name is Reuben.
This is my wife, Lisa.

125
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,274
I am here all afternoon.

126
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:25,194
All right, au revoir, Reuben, Lisa.
Solid.

127
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:26,946
Solid.

128
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:29,824
Hi. Hello. How's it going?

129
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,373
Reuben! Lisa!

130
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:40,292
- Hi.
- Hello.

131
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,171
- Isn't this exciting?
- It is. It's fun.

132
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:48,634
You know what? I think
I'm gonna skip the scuba diving.

133
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:52,388
Reuben, no. You called eight hotels.
They all said this guy was the best.

134
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:55,558
I know, but you know how I am
about boats, and I feel queasy.

135
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,143
Your stomach's acting funny?

136
00:07:57,227 --> 00:08:00,729
It's okay now, but you know
how it gets. So why don't you go?

137
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:03,065
We're on our honeymoon.
I won't go without you.

138
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,402
No, you've been wanting to try this.
I want you to go, okay?

139
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,488
It will be fun.
I'll pick you up at 4:00, all right?

140
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:11,699
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

141
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,833
You're not for scuba, Reuben?

142
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,669
No, Claude, I'm gonna go
run some errands in town.

143
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,672
But you guys go. Have fun.
Can I talk to you for a second?

144
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,090
Of course.

145
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:34,430
Listen, this woman means more to me
than anything else in the world,

146
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:35,848
so be careful.

147
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:39,518
Scuba can be very dangerous
if proper precautions aren't taken.

148
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:41,604
Reuben, look to me in my eyeball.

149
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,856
I promise you I take care of Lisa

150
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,275
as if she were
my own flesh and blood.

151
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,444
- Thank you.
- Okay?

152
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,071
- Solid.
- Okay, solid.

153
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:55,534
All right? Are you ready?

154
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:57,536
Yeah. Will a little boat come over...

155
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:58,746
Ally oop.

156
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,628
Au revoir, Reuben.

157
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,797
- Bye-bye, honey! I love you!
- I love you!

158
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:28,943
Lisa!

159
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,153
Claude!

160
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,280
Guys?

161
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,407
Hello!

162
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:38,160
Lisa?

163
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,540
Knock-knock!

164
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:47,211
Oh, my God.

165
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,880
- I love you!
- Ooh, la la!

166
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,091
Oh, my God!

167
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:55,511
Holy shit, Reuben!
This is not what it looks like.

168
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,680
You're staying on the island
with Claude?

169
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,765
I'm a little confused
right now, Reuben.

170
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,351
I think I need a little time
to figure things out.

171
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:05,145
What did you do to her?
Did you mess with her oxygen tanks?

172
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,522
I did nothing, Leuben.

173
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,607
My name's not Leuben! It is Reuben.

174
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:12,486
Look, we had a scuba, we talk about
life, we drink some white wine.

175
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,239
We cannot help it.
It is like love at first sight.

176
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:18,075
She make like the fire
in my trouser.

177
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:21,036
What he's trying to say, Reuben...

178
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:24,540
is that we didn't plan it.
It just... It happened.

179
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,167
It's like the story of the hippo.

180
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,545
I'm not familiar with that story.

181
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,755
The hippopotamus is not born going,

182
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,383
"Cool bean, I am a hippo."
No way, José.

183
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:38,304
So he tried to paint a stripe
on himself to be like the zebra

184
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:39,596
but he fool no one.

185
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:43,267
Then he tried to put the spot
on his skin to be like the leopard.

186
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,394
But everyone know he is a hippo.

187
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,229
So, at certain point,

188
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:50,190
he look himself in the mirror
and he just say,

189
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,443
"Hey, I am a hippopotamus...

190
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,737
"and there is nothing
I can do about it."

191
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:58,699
And, as soon as he accepts this,
he live life happy.

192
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:00,951
Happy as a hippo.

193
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:03,912
You understand?

194
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:08,250
- I'm gonna kill you!
- Reuben, no!

195
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:12,087
No, Reuben. This is not the way.

196
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,761
- You're gonna be fine, Reuben.
- No, I'm not gonna be fine.

197
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,222
I'm not gonna be fine at all.

198
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:25,434
Don't come back to me
when you change your mind,

199
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,519
because this ship has sailed.

200
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,006
Hey, Tina.

201
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:40,926
Hey, Mitch.

202
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,970
Hey, Reub.

203
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,140
- Cheryl.
- Hey.

204
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,150
Indursky & Sons, how may I help you?

205
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:03,198
What?

206
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,039
How does everyone know about this?

207
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:14,960
Your mother called Mr. Indursky
and told him what happened.

208
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,714
- I am so sorry, Reuben.
- Thanks, Gladys.

209
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,675
- Come here.
- Okay. Thank you.

210
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,470
- All right.
- I know.

211
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,934
Hey, there he is!
The big man's back.

212
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:34,855
Come on in here, I want to spitball
something with you.

213
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:38,358
Can you give me a minute?
I'm just going to the men's room.

214
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:40,986
I'll join you.

215
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:46,033
I heard about your honeymoon.
Just terrible.

216
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,704
I knew that girl was a slut
the second I met her.

217
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,790
Well, it's kind of complicated.
I mean, there's...

218
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,167
Don't make excuses.

219
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:59,171
She's a dime-store hooker and always
will be. Just put it behind you.

220
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:03,634
Speaking of which, you ever hear
of a guy named Leland Van Lew?

221
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,763
Leland Van Lew...
Yeah, Australian guy, right?

222
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,933
- Made the cover of Forbes last year?
- Exactly.

223
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:14,728
He started one of those high-tech,
modem-scrotum,

224
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:18,023
God-only-knows-what-they-do
companies anyway. Jesus Christ.

225
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,858
They want to take
the company public

226
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:23,487
and to remain CEO of the company,
guess what he needs?

227
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,739
- Life insurance.
- Bingo was his name.

228
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:29,701
- You want me to check him out?
- Yeah. There's just one catch.

229
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:34,498
This Van Lew has a reputation
as a cowboy.

230
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,501
Apparently, he's one
of these extreme-sports nuts.

231
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:40,045
So, it's a long shot

232
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,589
but if you can
pull this thing together,

233
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:44,758
there might be
a lot of dough in it for us,

234
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,761
an extra bonus for you,
help you with those house payments.

235
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:51,056
All right. Let's make sure
he checks out first, and...

236
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:56,019
You see? This is why you're the only
one I can trust with these jobs.

237
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:58,689
I was worried you'd been
through hell and back

238
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,566
with that whore wife of yours.

239
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,651
You sure you don't need
some more time off?

240
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:03,735
Mmm-hmm.

241
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,154
- I'm good. I'm fine.
- Absolutely sure?

242
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,949
All right, good things.

243
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:30,762
Excuse me.
This is private property.

244
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:33,932
Yeah, I know.
I just bought this house.

245
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:35,225
I move in next month.

246
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,478
Oh, sure. Mr. Phifer, right?

247
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:41,356
Feffer. But you can
just call me Reuben.

248
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:44,651
- Okay. Welcome to the neighborhood.
- Thanks.

249
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,697
Sorry about your wife, Reuben.

250
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:56,872
First of all, I want
to thank everybody for coming out.

251
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,541
This has been
an incredible day and night.

252
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:03,837
It's just so great to see all these
people, friends and family.

253
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,675
To tell you the truth, I've waited
for this day my entire life.

254
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,846
I'm so sorry, Reuben.

255
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,723
Thanks, Sandy.

256
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,517
- I'm here for you, brother.
- Thank you.

257
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,062
- We're rolling.
- Sound speed.

258
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,648
- What the hell is this?
- Remember Dustin and Vic?

259
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,567
They're doing the
E! True Hollywood Story on me.

260
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,736
Sorry about your wife.

261
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,822
- Sandy, you want us over here?
- By the table.

262
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,407
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

263
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,496
- Is this better?
- Yeah, thanks.

264
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,831
Look, forget it.
I'm not going to a party?

265
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,166
What do you think will happen?

266
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,169
Lisa'll waltz through that door,
saying she made a mistake?

267
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,171
No, of course not, I'm just...

268
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,840
I'm trying to make sense
out of what the hell she did.

269
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:51,259
What can I say,
you're my best friend.

270
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:52,761
You're my partner...

271
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,346
Hold on. Let me see something.

272
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,015
You're my wife!
Man, it feels good to say that!

273
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,350
And

274
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:03,105
you're my wife!
Man, it feels good to say that!

275
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,613
Check out her expression.
She's terrified.

276
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:18,286
- She's smiling.
- I'm a student of acting.

277
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:22,874
She's faking it.
The woman got spooked.

278
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,544
She needed to explore,
which is exactly what you'll do.

279
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:28,380
You've been gifted with freedom.
Don't turn your back on it.

280
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:31,049
I don't want freedom!
I want to be married!

281
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:32,551
I bought a goddamn house!

282
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:35,595
I got to move out of this apartment
in, like, six weeks!

283
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:40,142
Look at her.
She's not thinking about having

284
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,060
a deep, committed relationship

285
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:44,938
with a complex individual
like yourself.

286
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,151
- She's not?
- No!

287
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:53,071
She's daydreaming about having hot,
shallow sex with a French nudist!

288
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:56,908
"Oh, I'm hugging.
Oh, I love you so much." Liar!

289
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,828
Whose party? Is this again?

290
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,998
It's an art opening
for this Dutch guy, Jost.

291
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:07,002
His art sucks, but he used
to sell me really good pot.

292
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,465
Oh, man, I'm so frigging horny.

293
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,098
Just don't leave me alone.

294
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:22,684
I haven't been to a party? By myself
in a long time.

295
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:26,354
Relax. I'm your wingman.
I'll be by your side the whole time.

296
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,024
So what do we do?

297
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,110
Do we get a drink
or take a lap around the...

298
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:35,864
Sandy?

299
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,837
- More wine?
- Sure.

300
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:53,882
Thank you.

301
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:57,219
This party? 's so boring,
and there are no cute guys.

302
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:00,013
I haven't noticed.
I'm appreciating the art.

303
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,265
I'm not looking for cute guys.

304
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,976
You swore off men
since dumping your last boyfriend?

305
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:07,646
He was not my boyfriend.
We went out for three days.

306
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,564
- It was two months!
- Really?

307
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:22,077
I hope he doesn't have
to buy that now.

308
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:33,255
Oh, my God! I think I know that guy.

309
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,602
- You're Reuben Feffer, right?
- Yes?

310
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,272
I'm Polly Prince.

311
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:53,275
We went to junior high
or middle school

312
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,360
or whatever it's called, together.

313
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,195
- Yeah! Polly Prince!
- Yes.

314
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,031
It's coming back to me now.
You left before high school.

315
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:03,368
After seventh grade,
my mum and I moved to Michigan.

316
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,872
- Now you live here in New York?
- Moved here a few months ago.

317
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,707
- So, you know.
- Wow.

318
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:15,547
- Friend of yours?
- Yeah, that's Roxanne.

319
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:20,385
She does that with bread,
wine bottles, and... Anyway...

320
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:22,053
So what's your deal?

321
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:26,099
You've got to be married
with kids and the whole thing.

322
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:30,145
No, I'm not. I'm single.
I haven't taken the plunge.

323
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:32,647
Can I talk to you for a sec?

324
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:36,651
Sandy, this is Polly Prince.
Remember? From middle school?

325
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,653
- How you doing?
- Wow.

326
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:42,824
Okay, Sandy Lyle,
last time I saw you,

327
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:45,827
you were playing bagpipes
in that movie.

328
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,829
Croco Tears. Yep, that's me.

329
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:50,665
Polly! Can I have a word with you?

330
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,751
- Sorry.
- Excuse us.

331
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,502
What happened to you?

332
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,755
I'm in a situation here.
We must leave now.

333
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,423
Can we stay a couple more minutes?

334
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,092
Dude, no. This is serious.
I just sharted.

335
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,094
I don't know what that means.

336
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,764
I tried to fart, and a little
shit came out. I sharted.

337
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:07,349
Now let's go.

338
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:12,187
You're the most disgusting person
I've ever met in my life.

339
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:15,106
You have to walk around
and pour wine.

340
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,692
Polly? Focus for one second, okay?

341
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,323
So, hey, I got to go circulate.

342
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,453
So, Sandy, you're good though?
You're still acting?

343
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,206
I am.
Yeah, it's going incredibly well.

344
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:34,960
I'm actually headlining a new
revival of Jesus Christ Superstar.

345
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,544
That's great!

346
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:39,214
- It was really good seeing you guys.
- You, too.

347
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,299
- See you!
- All right. Bye, Polly.

348
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:42,717
Be good.

349
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:43,969
More wine?

350
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,889
Polly Prince. It's funny, huh?
Seeing her.

351
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,976
- Are you okay?
- Great, thank you.

352
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:55,480
She looks good.

353
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:56,481
Let it rain!

354
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:57,732
Let it rain!

355
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,236
I did a lot of thinking
last night...

356
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:03,238
and there's something
I'm excited about.

357
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,324
What's up? Nice. Let it rain!

358
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:10,161
I feel like I might be ready
to move on,

359
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:12,205
get my life back on track.

360
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:15,917
So, I am going to ask
Polly Prince on a date.

361
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:18,920
That's a mistake!
She's not right for you, dude.

362
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:20,880
Rain dance!

363
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,009
You guys want
to play some twos?

364
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:26,261
Actually, we're in
the middle of a conversation.

365
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,054
Did you douche bags
bring your "A" game?

366
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:29,848
What was that?

367
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:31,683
I'm just messing
with you, Sasquatch.

368
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,351
Let's get it on.

369
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:37,939
Pick and roll! Take it rough!
Outlet!

370
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:39,899
Rain dance!

371
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:41,860
Sandy, come on.

372
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,363
I got him.

373
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:47,782
White Chocolate!

374
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,285
Raindrops!

375
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,121
Old school!

376
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,791
T. Time-out.

377
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,252
I'm burning. My lungs are burning.

378
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,463
Time-out.

379
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,382
So why do you think
Polly's so wrong for me?

380
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,635
You don't even know this girl.

381
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:10,055
You haven't seen her
since seventh grade.

382
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:11,389
How different could she be?

383
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:13,475
She was a senior delegate
at the Model UN,

384
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,477
she was in the chess club,
a Mathlete.

385
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:17,395
Her yearbook stats are impressive.

386
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,647
Did you see the tattoo on her back?

387
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:20,982
Yeah. So what?

388
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:24,652
Mathletes don't wear body art
like that. Enough said. Ball in!

389
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:28,406
I really feel like I ran
into Polly for a reason. Really.

390
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:30,408
I'm sorry if you don't agree.

391
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:33,286
But I believe
in a little thing called destiny.

392
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,291
You guys ready?

393
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:43,004
You know what? You think maybe
you could put your shirt back on?

394
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:45,173
You guys ready to play?

395
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,681
Good shot.

396
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:56,434
Could I have the ball for a second?

397
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,693
You know what? Could we switch?

398
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:09,781
I'd rather not. I just found out
how to cover this man right here.

399
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,199
Let's play.

400
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:39,727
Can I get the number for a Polly
Prince, please? Prince with a "P."

401
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,400
Okay, great.
Can I get the address as well?

402
00:24:58,622 --> 00:24:59,706
Hello.

403
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:09,048
Oh, shit!

404
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,719
- Hi. This is Reuben.
- No!

405
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:15,013
I'm unable to get to the phone
right now

406
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:17,473
but please leave a detailed message
after the beep.

407
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,934
If you're calling for Lisa...

408
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:14,197
Gladys, I got to call you back.

409
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,870
This is so funny.
I didn't know you lived down here.

410
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,915
Yeah, I do.
Do you live around here, too?

411
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,668
No, I don't. I don't live down here.

412
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,381
Hey. Did you call me last night?

413
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:35,051
No. I don't think so.

414
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:36,386
Are you sure?

415
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:39,764
Because I got a hang-up
so I did that star-69 thingy.

416
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:43,017
And I swore
I got your answering machine.

417
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:46,062
Really? I heard that
from a few people,

418
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:48,815
so maybe the phone lines
got crossed or something.

419
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:51,859
- You doing some shopping?
- Oh, yeah.

420
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:55,697
Gosh, I spent like $200
on this loofah.

421
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:59,701
It's supposed to be specially made
in Sweden or something.

422
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:00,868
Wow.

423
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,247
Would you like to go
to dinner sometime?

424
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:08,876
Oh, yeah. Okay.
You know, I'm not sure.

425
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:11,212
Okay. Really?

426
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,923
Not that I wouldn't. I'd like to.

427
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,634
It would be great
to catch up on stuff and all that.

428
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:19,220
I just got to check my schedule.

429
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:22,098
All right, how about
I give you my card?

430
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:23,683
Here you go.

431
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,228
On the back I've written
my home and my cell number.

432
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,230
- There's also a fax number.
- Right on.

433
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,024
And a pager number, too.

434
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:33,901
"Reuben Feffer,
Senior Risk Assessment Analysist."

435
00:27:34,028 --> 00:27:35,945
- Right. Analyst.
- Analyst.

436
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,281
Right.

437
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:40,450
All right.

438
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:43,911
See you.

439
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,376
- See you.
- See you later.

440
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:59,302
Leland Van Lew's office.
This is Deborah.

441
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:02,972
Reuben Feffer from Indursky & Sons
calling for Mr. Van Lew.

442
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:06,642
Right. The insurance man.
He's in the hospital.

443
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:09,187
He got bit swimming
with great whites.

444
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:11,230
- Swimming with who?
- Great white sharks.

445
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:13,107
But don't worry.
It was only a flesh wound.

446
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:18,780
He's due in Los Angeles
next week.

447
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:22,033
- Should I set something up for then?
- Could you hang on, please?

448
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,618
No worries.

449
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:27,163
- Hi, Reuben. It's Polly Prince.
- Hey, Polly.

450
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,248
How's it going?

451
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,958
Good. I'm calling to say

452
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:34,128
I'm free tomorrow night
if you want to get together.

453
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,964
I'd love to get together.
That would be great.

454
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:39,467
Should I pick a restaurant, or...

455
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:41,010
No. You know what?

456
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:44,639
I should probably check my schedule,
see if I can even do it.

457
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:48,476
Okay. Did you say you were free?

458
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:52,438
No, I'm actually not sure.
I'll talk to you later. Bye!

459
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:53,940
Okay, hello?

460
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,276
One, two, three, and...

461
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:59,404
What's the buzz?
Tell me what's a-happening

462
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,531
What's the buzz?
Tell me what's a-happening

463
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:03,616
What's the buzz?
Tell me what's a-happening

464
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,743
What's the buzz?
Tell me what's a-happening

465
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:07,870
What's the buzz?
Tell me what's a-happening

466
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,039
What's the buzz?
Tell me what's a-happening

467
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,792
Why should you want to know?

468
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:15,169
Don't you mind about the future

469
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:19,799
Don't you try to think ahead

470
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:23,469
Save tomorrow for tomorrow

471
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,348
Think about today instead

472
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,016
- Sandy?
- What?

473
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:32,854
I'm playing Jesus. That's my song.

474
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:37,191
I know it's your song, but I felt
something and decided to go with it.

475
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,776
But you're playing Judas.

476
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:42,572
Judas. Look, here's the deal.
I'm the star of the show, okay?

477
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:47,034
So if I decide to bust out a solo,
give me the freedom to rock out.

478
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:48,870
From the top, Wonsuk.

479
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:52,665
- So the play's going well?
- Yeah, I think it's gonna be fun.

480
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:55,835
I just wish they wouldn't surround
me with a bunch of amateurs.

481
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,796
Isn't that
the point of community theatre?

482
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:00,047
Whatever.

483
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:04,051
- So I'm going on a date with Polly.
- All right! Where you taking her?

484
00:30:04,178 --> 00:30:08,222
Some restaurant in the East Village.
She left the address on my machine.

485
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:12,018
How could you let
Polly pick the restaurant?

486
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:14,312
I had no choice.

487
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:16,230
She called me seven times
to confirm

488
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,149
and then cancel
and then confirm again.

489
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,568
Why? What's wrong with letting her
pick the place?

490
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:23,362
You've got
irritable bowel syndrome, dude.

491
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,616
If she chose an ethnic restaurant,

492
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:29,911
you'll be running to the bathroom
every five seconds.

493
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,954
Oh, my God. You're right.

494
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:34,248
Thank you.

495
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:36,167
I doubt it will get this far

496
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:39,045
but if she turns out
to be easier than I thought...

497
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:41,005
there's something you need to know.

498
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,424
- I'm not a virgin, Sandy.
- Not technically

499
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,843
but times have changed
since you were last single.

500
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:47,261
Now listen...

501
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,890
when I'm making out with a girl
for the first time,

502
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:53,267
I like to give her
a little spanking.

503
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:55,061
- What?
- Nothing violent.

504
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:58,022
Just tap her real light
on the tush and say,

505
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:01,275
"Hey, I'm your daddy."

506
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,486
Listen to me.

507
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:06,531
- What are you doing?
- I'm blotting the grease.

508
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:10,284
That's the best part. Don't be shy.
It's just a little tap.

509
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,245
It's like saying,
"Boop, I'm your daddy."

510
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:13,412
I'm not gonna tap her.

511
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,122
Brings them right back to childhood.

512
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:18,042
Trust me, they're putty
in your hands after that.

513
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,962
I'm really excited about this.

514
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:23,297
I feel like
this could be one of those...

515
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:26,467
defining moments of my life,
or something, you know?

516
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:31,138
I actually think it's not gonna
work out, but I'm pulling for you.

517
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,850
Just pray to God
she doesn't go ethnic.

518
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,145
- The place didn't sound ethnic.
- What was the name?

519
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,397
Al Hafez.

520
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:46,904
- So, when did you live in Morocco?
- In the late '90s.

521
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:50,032
I bounced around to a bunch
of places over the past few years.

522
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,993
- Like where?
- Oh, God, where?

523
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:56,706
Let's see, Austin, Istanbul,
Sri Lanka, Portland,

524
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:59,250
Costa Rica, Buffalo,
a couple other places.

525
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:02,587
- Wow. Were you in the Peace Corps?
- No, I just like to move a lot.

526
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:05,756
I get stir-crazy if I'm stuck
in one place too long, you know?

527
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:07,258
Yeah, completely.

528
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:09,885
Remember,
you were the person who...

529
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,178
Oh, my God!

530
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,681
I can't believe you remember that.

531
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:17,435
Of course! You were the greatest
delegate in Model UN history.

532
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,688
I guess I did manage
to pass a few resolutions.

533
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:25,651
Are you okay? Because you're
sweating pretty profusely.

534
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:29,030
No, I'm fine. I always react
this way to spicy food.

535
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:30,740
But I love it.

536
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:33,034
I can't believe you're not married.

537
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,827
Even when we were kids,

538
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,622
I saw you as the guy
who'd settle down at a young age.

539
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:39,874
You were always kind of
like an old young guy.

540
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,208
Well, it just hasn't happened.

541
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:44,962
But what about you?
You ever gotten close?

542
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:49,258
To the whole marriage thing?
Oh, God, no. No way, no. No.

543
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:53,971
I'm not really big on the whole
long-term commitment thing.

544
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,266
Why, are you coming
out of a bad relationship?

545
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,769
No. I'm coming
out of eight bad relationships.

546
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:00,936
Eight?

547
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:04,398
- You sure I can't get you a towel?
- No, I'm good.

548
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:08,402
But if the right person came along,
things might be different, right?

549
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:11,739
Yeah. You're probably right.

550
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:15,493
Sorry.

551
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:20,539
- You mind if I go to the men's room?
- Please, sure.

552
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:21,666
Oh, gosh!

553
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:27,672
Occupied. I'm going to be here
all night, dude.

554
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,719
- All right, well, this is me.
- Great.

555
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:35,262
Why don't you come upstairs

556
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:37,306
and I'll make you
some coffee or tea.

557
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:38,557
Great.

558
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:41,060
I just got to find my keys here.

559
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,520
Oh, shoot.

560
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,775
Right there, I hear them.

561
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:52,530
Oh, yeah. Okay.

562
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:53,489
- Wow! This is great, so cozy.
- Thanks.

563
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,908
- Wow! This is great, so cozy.
- Thanks.

564
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:59,620
- Did you just move in?
- No, I've been here four months.

565
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:01,914
Rat! Rat in the house!

566
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:06,043
Oh, no. This is Rodolfo.
He's a ferret.

567
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,879
I got him in Sicily
at a flea market years ago.

568
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:11,298
He's old.
He can't really see anymore.

569
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:14,635
Cute. You mind
if I use your bathroom?

570
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,761
Sure.

571
00:34:15,846 --> 00:34:18,889
That's not the bathroom.
My bathroom's right here.

572
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,309
Okay. Yeah, because I just...

573
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:26,230
had a lot to drink, a lot of water.
I'll just be a second.

574
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,898
Okay, take your time.

575
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:36,198
I don't believe this.

576
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:43,998
Go away.

577
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:12,735
Oh, no.

578
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:52,942
God, I beg you, please,
if you make this water go down,

579
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:56,403
I'll sit at your feet
and serve you for all of eternity.

580
00:35:57,489 --> 00:36:00,783
I'll adopt a Somalian kid
or I'll work in Calcutta

581
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:04,328
or I'll just...
Please, make the water go down.

582
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,510
Oh, my God!

583
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,931
- This was fun.
- Yes.

584
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,810
If I'd known your grandmother
embroidered that towel,

585
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:30,521
- I would've never...
- Really, that's okay.

586
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:35,109
- Okay, well, good night, Polly.
- Good night, Reuben.

587
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:37,194
- Good night.
- Okay.

588
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:39,530
- All right, okay.
- All right, that's nice.

589
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:48,664
Why would you make
number two in her apartment?

590
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:51,458
She asked me to come upstairs.
What should I have done?

591
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:54,211
Tell her you're tired
and shag ass out of there.

592
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:55,337
Guys.

593
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,382
- What was that?
- I called her to apologize.

594
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:02,177
It doesn't matter, because I doubt
she'll ever want to see me again.

595
00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:04,388
- I got to call you back.
- Cool.

596
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,639
Mr. Van Lew?

597
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,393
- Feffer?
- Yes. Hi, Reuben Feffer.

598
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,437
I recognized you
from the Forbes cover.

599
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:14,440
You're way early, sport.
Come on, then. Get in.

600
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:16,817
- Is this the service elevator?
- Yeah.

601
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:20,362
I don't think we'll have a problem
with this insurance business.

602
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:23,574
Sure, I take chances, but you can't
build a successful business

603
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,492
- without the occasional risk.
- Of course.

604
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:29,079
What I'm trying to determine are the
kinds of risks you actually take.

605
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:30,539
Only the calculated ones.

606
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:32,708
Trust me, I plan on being around
for ages.

607
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:36,337
I know we'd really love to give you
a policy if we can make it work.

608
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,672
- We'll make it work, sport.
- Great.

609
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:42,801
- So, what are we doing on the roof?
- I'm doing a bit of a BASE jump.

610
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:46,013
Here, keep the walkie on channel 13,
all right?

611
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,890
I don't know
what you're talking about.

612
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,975
A free-fall
from an inanimate object.

613
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,937
Always carry me chute in case
I find a good launching point.

614
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:54,313
Oh, no.

615
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,649
Look, just don't do anything,
all right?

616
00:37:56,733 --> 00:38:00,861
- Hey, Reuben, it's Polly Prince.
- Polly, how's it going?

617
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:04,239
- I'll shout when I'm through, okay?
- No, that's not all right.

618
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:05,407
Can I call you back?

619
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:08,077
I just wanted to tell you
I got your message.

620
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:11,246
Let's just start over
and forget about the loofah thing.

621
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:12,665
Holy shit! No!

622
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,459
Holy shit!

623
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,169
I didn't even like that loofah.

624
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:20,255
Relax. Leland's meeting
with the insurance guy right now.

625
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,758
Whoa! Yeah!

626
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,514
Oh, crap!

627
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,225
- Oh, shit!
- I'll call you in the next few days.

628
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,852
Leland to Feffer. You there, mate?

629
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,397
Yes, Feffer to Leland, hello?

630
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:37,982
Come on down and give us a hand.

631
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:40,067
I think I fractured me coccyx.

632
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,910
Look at that.
You got me a new loofah.

633
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:51,203
It's from Finland

634
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:54,206
and the salesman said
it has a very ergonomic design.

635
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:58,252
Oh, Reuben, that's really...
Thank you, that's really sweet.

636
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,878
Oh, my God!

637
00:39:00,422 --> 00:39:02,256
I don't believe this!

638
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,133
What are you doing here?

639
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:05,843
We're having an early supper.

640
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:07,761
I wanted your father
to try new cuisines.

641
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:08,929
It's only 3:00.

642
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:10,889
It's a crime to beat
the dinner crowds?

643
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:14,268
- Who is this young woman...
- This is Polly Prince.

644
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:17,604
Polly, these are my parents,
Irving and Vivian Feffer.

645
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:20,441
- It's so good meeting you.
- How are you?

646
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:23,402
I can't believe you're
eating Indian. You hate spicy food.

647
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:24,945
No, I don't.

648
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:28,615
Well, I'm going to... Psst!
I'm going to ask...

649
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:31,201
I'm going to ask
this nice Native American man

650
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:32,411
to get us a bigger table.

651
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,872
They're Indian.
You can call them Indian. It's okay.

652
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:39,752
Hi. Need big table, please.
Four people. Many thanks.

653
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:43,672
Okay.

654
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:46,842
Now, how do you kids
know each other?

655
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:50,846
We went to middle school together.
We were both in the Model UN.

656
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,432
You still work in government, honey?

657
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:56,185
No. I'm a waitress.

658
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,521
She's also writing
a children's book.

659
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:01,315
Oh, very nice.

660
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:04,401
You'll never guess
who I ran into yesterday.

661
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:06,111
- Who's that?
- Lisa's mother.

662
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:07,279
Mmm-hmm. That's good.

663
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,698
Dad, did you try this...
What's this called?

664
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:11,742
- Saag.
- Saag. Did you try this?

665
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:15,537
Apparently, Lisa's doing wonderfully
down there in St. Barts...

666
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:17,122
selling villas, happy.

667
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:18,624
That's good for her.

668
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:21,293
- Now, who's Lisa?
- Not important.

669
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,003
Lisa is Reuben's wife.

670
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:26,924
She left him for another man
on their honeymoon.

671
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,677
Are we ready for the check?
I think we'll take the check.

672
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:31,970
What?

673
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:37,017
- Well, your dad seems really nice.
- Yes, a man of few words.

674
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:41,855
I just want you to know, I was going
to tell you about Lisa. I just...

675
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,066
I was embarrassed and I...

676
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:46,693
I guess because I hadn't seen you
for so long...

677
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,779
It's so okay. I understand.

678
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:51,990
I was an idiot. I should've told you
the truth from the start.

679
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:53,992
Really, I'm not upset.

680
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:58,372
- But when did this happen?
- Two weeks ago.

681
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:01,208
Two weeks ago?

682
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:05,003
Oh, my God! Are you okay?

683
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,383
Well, it was a pretty big shock.

684
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:14,930
I walked in on her, on Lisa with...

685
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:18,934
a scuba instructor on the first day
of our honeymoon.

686
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:23,564
They were still wearing
their flippers. Anyway...

687
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,654
I mean...

688
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:39,788
Hey, Reuben, it's Polly Prince.

689
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:44,168
I don't know
if you have any plans tonight

690
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:48,672
but if not, you should swing by
37 Gansevort Street around 9:00...

691
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,884
if you can make it.
You know, it's no big deal.

692
00:41:51,968 --> 00:41:55,304
But it could be fun,
so, you know, think about it.

693
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:58,348
Okay, so...

694
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,267
I'll see you later.

695
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:02,019
Or not. I mean, either way.

696
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:05,606
Oh, if you do come,
you should wear comfortable shoes.

697
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:08,483
That is, if you come,
which you totally don't have to.

698
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:10,777
I mean, I might not even be there.

699
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:19,494
I am so glad that you came.

700
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:21,788
I wore comfortable shoes
like you said.

701
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:23,540
So, what are we doing?

702
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,835
Oh, crap.

703
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:35,219
This place is a total secret.

704
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:38,013
It's the best underground
salsa club in New York.

705
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:42,017
- I'm not really a big dancer.
- It's easier than it looks.

706
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:46,730
- There you go. Feel it in your legs.
- All right.

707
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:48,315
Sorry.

708
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:51,610
It's okay. Just step on my feet
a little less than that.

709
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:01,828
Work it!

710
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:09,378
- Looking good, Pollyanna.
- Hey, Javi.

711
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:14,007
Oh, you should stop that.
This is my friend Reuben.

712
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:16,009
This is Javi.

713
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:18,720
Mind if I dance
with the beautiful lady?

714
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:22,182
- I guess not.
- Thanks, man.

715
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:03,390
- I think I might take off.
- Really?

716
00:44:03,933 --> 00:44:05,350
Are you having a bad time?

717
00:44:05,435 --> 00:44:08,270
No, I'm just not into
this whole dirty? Dancing thing.

718
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:10,188
What do you mean, "dirty? Dancing"?

719
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:13,567
I saw that movie. I know that's what
you and that Spaniard were doing.

720
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:17,070
Whoa! Wait a minute.
First of all, he's Cuban.

721
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:20,449
And that wasn't dirty? Dancing,
that was just salsa.

722
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:23,869
Okay, I'm just really, truthfully
not the kind of guy

723
00:44:23,953 --> 00:44:26,121
that's ever gonna be
into these kind of clubs...

724
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:28,081
Okay, Reuben, then...

725
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:31,001
tell me, what kind of guy are you?

726
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:33,462
What kind of guy am I?
What do you mean?

727
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:37,049
Up until now, you haven't exactly
been the portrait of honesty.

728
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:40,594
So just come clean, okay?
Just tell me who you are.

729
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,555
- I hate spicy food.
- I knew it!

730
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:46,516
I don't like it at all.
I have a mild case of IBS and...

731
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:48,352
- What's that?
- Irritable bowel syndrome.

732
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:50,687
- What?
- Irritable bowel syndrome.

733
00:44:50,772 --> 00:44:54,024
Oh, God. That's terrible. What else?

734
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:56,526
The thing is,
I assess risk for a living.

735
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:59,863
So I know I have a 0.013% chance
of being hit by a car

736
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:02,491
on my way home,
or a 1 in 46,000 chance

737
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:04,659
- of falling through a subway grate.
- Really?

738
00:45:04,786 --> 00:45:08,038
I manage that risk by
avoiding danger, having a plan

739
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,498
and knowing my next move.

740
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:12,459
And I guess
you don't live your life that way...

741
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,127
No, I do it a little differently.

742
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:17,130
Which is great, but I'm not
gonna ever be a dirty? Dancer

743
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:18,840
and I don't eat food
with my hands

744
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,133
and I really like you

745
00:45:20,218 --> 00:45:22,969
but I just don't think
this is gonna work out.

746
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:33,063
- I just have to go pee.
- Okay.

747
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:50,539
Just kidding!

748
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:53,583
Oh! Funny.

749
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:24,197
Hi.

750
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,050
Ow!

751
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:47,137
Did you just spank me?

752
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:50,056
No! I don't...

753
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,935
Are you sure? Because it felt
like you just swatted me.

754
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:55,979
No, I have a little crick
in my wrist.

755
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,148
You felt that, I was just...
Do you hear that?

756
00:46:58,232 --> 00:46:59,858
- Really?
- Yeah, you hear that?

757
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,443
Well, I got it out.

758
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:14,164
Oh, wow. This is incredible.

759
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:16,249
Oh, man.

760
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:19,794
Oh, God. Oh, yeah.

761
00:47:20,046 --> 00:47:23,215
Oh, no! No, you can't be done yet.

762
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:24,883
Come on, Reuben, focus.

763
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:27,344
You have to last
at least five minutes here.

764
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:30,722
Four minutes, twenty-seven,
twenty-six, twenty-five.

765
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:35,727
Two minutes, twenty, nineteen,
eighteen, seventeen.

766
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:40,273
Come on, you can do it.
55, 54, 53, 52, 51, oh, God!

767
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:41,608
Fifty!

768
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,948
Fifty? Yeah!

769
00:47:49,075 --> 00:47:50,116
Whoo!

770
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:52,369
Let it rain!

771
00:47:53,746 --> 00:47:56,039
I think I might end up marrying
this woman.

772
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:58,166
Really? After one night?

773
00:47:58,376 --> 00:48:00,126
Did you spank her?

774
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:02,879
Yeah, I tried,
but I don't think she liked it.

775
00:48:02,964 --> 00:48:05,173
Yeah, some women find it offensive.

776
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,384
Iceman!

777
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,930
I did not sleep with him
out of charity.

778
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,099
You weren't interested
till you found out

779
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:15,976
his wife boned a guy
on their honeymoon.

780
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:20,188
That's not it.
He is a kind, decent, solid guy.

781
00:48:20,273 --> 00:48:22,482
I've never been
with anybody like that.

782
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:25,151
Still sounds like a charity boning.

783
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:28,488
Do you have to use
the word "bone" every time?

784
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:31,408
I use it when it's appropriate.

785
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:35,996
Ever heard of a guy shouting out
"fifty" when he orgasmed?

786
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:42,419
Okay, so throw pillows
go in this cabinet here.

787
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:47,424
You don't sleep on these?

788
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,343
No, they're decorative.

789
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:53,430
- For who?
- What do you mean?

790
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:56,808
You're the only one who sees them,
but you don't sleep on them.

791
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:59,060
You take them off the bed,
put them in a box,

792
00:48:59,145 --> 00:49:02,522
take them out, put them...
I just don't understand the point.

793
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:05,400
I don't know.
Lisa thought they looked nice.

794
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:06,693
Oh, I see.

795
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:22,375
I don't see what the big deal is.
They make the bed look nice.

796
00:49:27,048 --> 00:49:28,757
What are you doing?
That's goose down.

797
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:30,634
I'm liberating you.

798
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:33,428
- Try it.
- No, I'm not going to...

799
00:49:33,554 --> 00:49:36,222
Just one stab.
Come on, see how you feel.

800
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,683
- This is ridiculous.
- It's not ridiculous.

801
00:49:38,768 --> 00:49:41,227
It's not like driving a knife
into a pillow

802
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:43,563
is suddenly going
to make me feel...

803
00:49:44,065 --> 00:49:46,149
Wow. That feels really good.

804
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:47,942
Right?

805
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:51,363
- What did I tell you?
- You're right.

806
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:52,656
Come on, bigger one!

807
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:55,408
- What's the point of these things?
- No point.

808
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:56,743
Stupid.

809
00:49:58,579 --> 00:50:01,581
- Am I running a bed-and-breakfast?
- Not anymore.

810
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:03,041
Know how many minutes I spend

811
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:04,751
- getting them on and off?
- How many?

812
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:07,087
Four in the morning, four at night.
Eight minutes.

813
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:09,339
Fifty-six minutes a week,
two days a year,

814
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:12,592
spent putting pillows
on and off a stupid bed!

815
00:50:13,761 --> 00:50:15,011
Whoa!

816
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,139
Wait, you hit mattress.

817
00:50:18,224 --> 00:50:19,224
Oh!

818
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:23,520
You know what? I really got to go.
I'm late. Shoot!

819
00:50:23,604 --> 00:50:25,146
What's wrong?
Lose your keys again?

820
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:28,149
No, they're just not
where I left them before.

821
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,318
Why don't you use that key-finder
I bought you?

822
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:32,445
- I don't...
- I think it could help.

823
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,698
...need the stupid key-finder!

824
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:37,784
All right. Anyway, I was thinking
I'd come meet you.

825
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:40,578
Really? I thought you hated
dirty? Dancing clubs.

826
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,082
It's just salsa. It will be fun.
I'll watch.

827
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:45,792
- What's that noise?
- Nothing.

828
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:49,254
- It's the key-finder, isn't it?
- It's so not the key-finder.

829
00:50:49,338 --> 00:50:52,173
- Yes, it is!
- It's not. I'll see you later. Bye.

830
00:50:53,843 --> 00:50:54,968
How?

831
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:27,500
- Reuby Tuesday, ¿cómo estás?
- Doing all right.

832
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:36,551
You know what? Actually,
me no estás too good, Javier.

833
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:41,681
I want you to stay away from Polly.
Find yourself another dance partner.

834
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:43,683
Why?

835
00:51:44,185 --> 00:51:47,061
Because she and I are a couple.
Yeah, we're dating.

836
00:51:47,188 --> 00:51:50,023
And I'm not going to let
some big-shot salsa king

837
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:53,067
sweep in, with your mambo moves
and your Erik Estrada look

838
00:51:53,194 --> 00:51:56,905
and take her away. That's happened
before, and it won't again...

839
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:59,824
- Reuben, I am gay.
- I don't care what you... What?

840
00:51:59,909 --> 00:52:01,534
I'm homosexual.

841
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:04,704
My boyfriend, Hector, plays
the keyboards in the house band.

842
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:05,789
Oh.

843
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:10,585
You think maybe you could give me
some salsa lessons?

844
00:52:40,783 --> 00:52:44,160
- You hated it.
- No, I don't. It's just...

845
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:47,747
It's very graphic
for a children's book.

846
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:50,416
You know? Like this one...

847
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:55,088
- "The boy with a nub for an arm."
- That one has a moral.

848
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:59,259
To teach kids to be careful when
they're playing with fireworks.

849
00:52:59,385 --> 00:53:02,929
Right, and I think it's brilliant,
by the way, seriously.

850
00:53:04,473 --> 00:53:05,682
I mean, you really convey...

851
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:09,435
the pain and the fear,
and I love the little doggy, too.

852
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:12,939
But, and I don't mean this
in a bad way...

853
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:14,107
Right.

854
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:17,402
...just what were you thinking?

855
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:37,964
I put all the risks and rewards
into the program,

856
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,216
which helps me finalize my
recommendations...

857
00:53:40,301 --> 00:53:42,969
"Leland Van Lew. BASE jumping."

858
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:47,473
That's supposed to be so much fun!
That should be on the rewards side.

859
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:51,060
It's one of the most dangerous
activities a human being can do.

860
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:52,228
- Really?
- Yeah.

861
00:53:52,313 --> 00:53:53,730
Have you done it?

862
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:56,232
Have I parachuted
off the top of a building?

863
00:53:56,317 --> 00:53:57,483
No.

864
00:53:57,818 --> 00:54:00,320
So how do you know what it's like?

865
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:03,948
I don't.

866
00:54:05,326 --> 00:54:06,826
Interesting.

867
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:09,996
Would you like some more bulgogi?

868
00:54:10,122 --> 00:54:12,582
Sure, thanks. I actually like this.

869
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:13,958
- You do?
- It's good.

870
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:19,172
Now you look like
a pro racquetballer.

871
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:21,466
- How's that shirt fit?
- It's fine.

872
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:23,468
I thought maybe
we could just sit and talk.

873
00:54:23,552 --> 00:54:25,303
I'm not a big racquetball player...

874
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:27,430
No worries.
We'll have a few giggles.

875
00:54:33,479 --> 00:54:35,480
I've been running the numbers.

876
00:54:37,483 --> 00:54:40,818
And I got to say, things don't look
good from our end.

877
00:54:40,903 --> 00:54:42,320
- Bollocks!
- Jesus!

878
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:49,786
Please, Leland, I mean,
it's not just the BASE jumping.

879
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:53,748
It's the heli-skiing,
volcano-luging, shark-diving.

880
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:58,169
Bottom line is, unless you
drastically alter your lifestyle,

881
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:02,340
- we won't be able to insure you.
- Reuben, I came to you for a reason.

882
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:06,886
I was told you had more imagination
than other blokes in the big firms.

883
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:09,931
That you analyze the man
and not just the numbers.

884
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:11,641
I guess I was wrong.

885
00:55:12,977 --> 00:55:14,727
Are you trying to manipulate me?

886
00:55:14,812 --> 00:55:17,855
Of course I am.
But I want to hold on to me company.

887
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:24,696
I'll tell you what.

888
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,824
I'll be in Nantucket
at the end of the month.

889
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:30,326
Come up and be my guest
aboard The 'Roo Shooter.

890
00:55:30,411 --> 00:55:32,120
- Aboard the what?
- My sailboat.

891
00:55:32,204 --> 00:55:34,831
I'll take you for a sail,
give you a chance to know me.

892
00:55:34,915 --> 00:55:38,334
By the end of the weekend,
you'll know what a safe bet I am.

893
00:55:38,419 --> 00:55:41,879
You know what?
You're bleeding pretty bad.

894
00:55:41,964 --> 00:55:44,007
I think I've swallowed a tooth.

895
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:48,761
No. Got it.

896
00:55:50,222 --> 00:55:51,514
Your serve.

897
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:55,101
So I tell Leland
we can't insure him.

898
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:57,311
He responds by inviting me
to Nantucket

899
00:55:57,396 --> 00:55:59,147
for some
Death Race Sailing Challenge.

900
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:02,692
Really? We got to go do that.
I've never been to Nantucket.

901
00:56:02,943 --> 00:56:06,112
- You want to come?
- Is that rude, to invite myself?

902
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:09,824
Lt'd be great! Good, you'll actually
commit to something in advance.

903
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:11,951
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

904
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:16,247
Okay, yeah, I am.
I think that would be really fun.

905
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:18,499
- What?
- What are you doing?

906
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:21,044
I'm going to have some nuts.

907
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:25,048
No. You don't eat mixed nuts
at a bar. Everybody knows that.

908
00:56:25,174 --> 00:56:27,133
What are you talking about?

909
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,969
Okay, let's say, conservatively...

910
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:33,765
17 people eat these nuts
on a given night. Okay?

911
00:56:33,849 --> 00:56:36,726
If they've been here for two weeks,
we're talking about...

912
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:39,979
238 people who've dipped their
dirty? Hands into that bowl.

913
00:56:40,064 --> 00:56:41,981
Dirty? Why are their hands dirty??

914
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:43,775
Only one out of six people

915
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:45,693
wash hands
when they go to the bathroom.

916
00:56:45,778 --> 00:56:48,362
When you think you're innocently
eating a bar snack,

917
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:50,573
you're ingesting
potentially deadly bacteria

918
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,742
from 39 soil-handed strangers.

919
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:55,036
People wonder why
they get E. Coli poisoning

920
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,454
or salmonella or hepatitis.

921
00:56:56,538 --> 00:57:00,041
They should look at the snack bowl
at their local watering hole.

922
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:04,879
I'm not being neurotic.
It's a hot zone in there.

923
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:11,552
How could you have eaten those?

924
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:14,263
I made such a compelling argument.

925
00:57:14,348 --> 00:57:16,682
I like to live life on the edge.

926
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,852
- Thank you.
- Yeah, you never know.

927
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:33,908
You don't have to do this.

928
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:36,869
I don't care that you don't know
how to dance!

929
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:39,539
I thought I'd give it one last try.
Hey, Javi.

930
00:57:39,623 --> 00:57:41,624
Hey, Reuben. You ready?

931
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:42,834
Uh-huh.

932
00:57:42,918 --> 00:57:44,043
What's happening?

933
00:57:44,128 --> 00:57:45,920
- IFuerte!
- What?

934
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:50,216
What are you doing?

935
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:13,507
I don't know where that came from!

936
00:59:13,634 --> 00:59:15,301
It was just awesome.

937
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:17,470
Holy shit.

938
00:59:25,145 --> 00:59:27,230
What are you doing here?

939
00:59:30,234 --> 00:59:31,567
I'm back.

940
00:59:34,196 --> 00:59:35,613
Who's this?

941
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:38,783
- Who's this? This is my girlfriend.
- What?

942
00:59:38,867 --> 00:59:41,118
- You have a girlfriend?
- I'm not your girlfriend.

943
00:59:41,203 --> 00:59:44,497
I mean, we're just, kind of...
Hi, I'm Polly.

944
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:48,167
- Lisa.
- Right.

945
00:59:55,968 --> 01:00:00,346
You guys probably have a lot
to talk about, so I'll just go.

946
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:03,266
- I don't want you to go.
- Please, I want to go. Bye, Lisa.

947
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:05,309
- Nice to meet you.
- I don't want you to go.

948
01:00:05,394 --> 01:00:07,478
You got to talk about it.

949
01:00:08,272 --> 01:00:09,855
I'm just going to go.

950
01:00:16,697 --> 01:00:17,780
I don't understand.

951
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:20,658
I thought you were really happy
with Claude.

952
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:24,704
I was, for a few weeks, but all he
talked about was scuba diving.

953
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:27,164
- Really?
- I missed you, Reuben.

954
01:00:27,249 --> 01:00:30,584
I missed you, too, but come on!
What was I supposed to do?

955
01:00:30,669 --> 01:00:32,962
I moved on. I'm in a relationship.

956
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,630
- What, with that Polly person?
- Yeah.

957
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:36,632
She doesn't call herself
your girlfriend.

958
01:00:36,717 --> 01:00:39,468
That's... No, she just doesn't like
the phrasing.

959
01:00:39,553 --> 01:00:42,138
Okay, then,
let me just ask you this.

960
01:00:42,222 --> 01:00:46,225
Are you really going to spend
the rest of your life with her?

961
01:00:46,727 --> 01:00:48,311
I don't know, Lisa.

962
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:51,355
Because I'm ready to do that
with you.

963
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:54,233
I made a mistake,
and I took you for granted.

964
01:00:54,401 --> 01:00:58,404
But I promise you that I will
never, ever hurt you again.

965
01:01:00,866 --> 01:01:02,867
I love you, Reuben.

966
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,417
You know what?

967
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:15,629
I think you should
go stay with your parents. Okay?

968
01:01:15,714 --> 01:01:18,507
- I've to leave in a week.
- What? Where are you going?

969
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:21,802
I'm going into the house
I bought for us. Remember?

970
01:01:21,887 --> 01:01:24,847
Let's do it together.
Let's go move into our house.

971
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:28,476
We don't just...
No. We can't just go... I can't...

972
01:01:31,897 --> 01:01:34,982
I don't even know
what to say right now, okay? So...

973
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,487
Okay.

974
01:01:42,991 --> 01:01:45,076
If you want to get back together
with her...

975
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:48,120
No, I wouldn't be seeing you
if I was planning...

976
01:01:48,205 --> 01:01:51,415
It's cool. You guys are married.
She came back.

977
01:01:52,084 --> 01:01:54,377
How's it coming
with Herb Lazare, D.D. S?

978
01:01:54,795 --> 01:01:57,588
I haven't even gotten to it.
I'm still working on Van Lew.

979
01:01:57,672 --> 01:02:00,299
I thought you decided on Van Lew
two weeks ago.

980
01:02:00,384 --> 01:02:02,635
We present to AFLAC on Wednesday.

981
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:05,179
- Can you hang on? Hang on.
- I have to go.

982
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:08,057
- Better not be bonus-hunting on me.
- Bonus-hunting?

983
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:11,560
That man's career's on the line.
I owe him a thorough analysis.

984
01:02:11,645 --> 01:02:12,770
All right.

985
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:15,523
I'm going to Barbados with
my mistress for the weekend.

986
01:02:15,607 --> 01:02:18,317
I want this Van Lew thing settled
by the time I get back.

987
01:02:18,402 --> 01:02:20,653
I am on it, and I'll make it happen.

988
01:02:20,779 --> 01:02:22,238
Good things.

989
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:25,241
Damn!

990
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:28,077
- Hey, pal.
- Hey, Larry.

991
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:30,162
Lisa dropped this off for you.

992
01:02:30,831 --> 01:02:32,081
Oh!

993
01:02:32,916 --> 01:02:34,041
Thanks.

994
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:49,932
I met Lisa Kramer, who showed me
an apartment, which I rented...

995
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:52,726
- just so she'd go out with me.
- I gave him a good price.

996
01:02:52,811 --> 01:02:54,895
Not good enough. She's a killer.

997
01:03:06,283 --> 01:03:08,159
I just can't believe she came back.

998
01:03:08,243 --> 01:03:11,620
Can we just focus for a second?
I'm almost finished.

999
01:03:11,705 --> 01:03:14,748
- What's next?
- Polly's career prospects.

1000
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:17,877
Risky. She's writing a children's
book where kids get maimed.

1001
01:03:17,961 --> 01:03:22,173
Her lack of career is a positive.
She'd have more time for the kids.

1002
01:03:22,466 --> 01:03:26,385
You're skewing the numbers in
her favor. Why are we doing this?

1003
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:28,387
Because I'm confused.

1004
01:03:28,472 --> 01:03:30,014
My goddamn wife

1005
01:03:30,098 --> 01:03:32,766
shows up on my doorstep
wanting to get back together.

1006
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:34,727
Polly's freaking out.

1007
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:37,938
I just want to make sure
I'm making the right decision.

1008
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:42,109
I don't see how putting these
two girls in the Riskmaster

1009
01:03:42,194 --> 01:03:44,236
will help you make up your mind.

1010
01:03:48,867 --> 01:03:50,784
- Interesting.
- What's it say?

1011
01:03:51,453 --> 01:03:52,495
Polly!

1012
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:54,663
- Polly?
- Yeah.

1013
01:03:54,873 --> 01:03:57,958
No way. Just cut your losses
and get back with Lisa.

1014
01:03:58,043 --> 01:04:01,212
I checked it three times.
It says she's the safer choice.

1015
01:04:01,296 --> 01:04:02,630
Whatever.

1016
01:04:03,924 --> 01:04:07,551
By the way, is your health okay?
You're looking thin.

1017
01:04:07,636 --> 01:04:09,845
Polly's been making me
eat ethnic food,

1018
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:12,348
so I've been throwing up
a lot lately.

1019
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:13,933
Cool.

1020
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:15,351
Polly Prince.

1021
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:18,812
Polly Feffer.

1022
01:04:21,316 --> 01:04:23,234
Polly Prince-Feffer.

1023
01:04:23,652 --> 01:04:26,320
You can't cancel.
You were so excited to go.

1024
01:04:26,488 --> 01:04:27,696
I know, but...

1025
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:31,033
We fell in love
with these funny Bolivian mud huts.

1026
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:32,826
- Hold on.
- So we had our designer

1027
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:35,079
use a similar color palette
in here.

1028
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:38,999
Hi. I'm sorry, I'm on the phone.
Would you just please keep it...

1029
01:04:40,669 --> 01:04:43,963
Also, I feel weird going away
for the weekend

1030
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:47,466
- when your wife just came back.
- You're making this such a big deal.

1031
01:04:47,551 --> 01:04:50,469
I told you, I'm not getting back
together with her.

1032
01:04:51,846 --> 01:04:53,347
- So are you coming?
- I'm coming.

1033
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:55,432
- All right.
- Okay?

1034
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:56,850
Bye.

1035
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:25,296
- You're good. You're a natural.
- This is amazing!

1036
01:05:25,547 --> 01:05:28,632
Hey, Leland, are those storm clouds
up ahead?

1037
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:34,305
No, we might get a light dusting.
Nothing to write home about.

1038
01:05:38,602 --> 01:05:40,019
Are you sure you're all right?

1039
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:43,063
I'm okay. I don't think I have
my sea legs yet.

1040
01:05:43,148 --> 01:05:45,316
- I'll be out in a sec.
- All right.

1041
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:47,234
Oh, God.

1042
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:56,327
I know we haven't been seeing each
other long, but I feel like...

1043
01:05:56,411 --> 01:05:58,787
it's time we take things
to the next level

1044
01:05:58,872 --> 01:06:02,291
and I'd like you
to consider moving in with me.

1045
01:06:11,051 --> 01:06:13,177
Why don't we just move in together?

1046
01:06:21,186 --> 01:06:24,021
Oh, yeah, we're going to have
ourselves a tussle.

1047
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:30,736
Rodolfo's in your toiletry kit.
Did you know that?

1048
01:06:31,029 --> 01:06:33,155
Did you pack him, or did you...

1049
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:34,573
What is this?

1050
01:06:34,658 --> 01:06:38,077
Why am I in your computer
on your Riskmaster thingy?

1051
01:06:38,161 --> 01:06:40,162
Okay, you know what?
I can explain this.

1052
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:42,998
It's fascinating, actually.
I learned a lot about myself.

1053
01:06:43,083 --> 01:06:46,960
I've learned that I have no career,
I'm flaky, I like ethnic food.

1054
01:06:47,045 --> 01:06:48,712
Would you let me explain?

1055
01:06:48,797 --> 01:06:52,091
Lisa came back, and I've been trying
to figure things out.

1056
01:06:52,175 --> 01:06:56,095
- What are you figuring out?
- Just about us, and our future.

1057
01:06:56,638 --> 01:06:59,682
Future? What are you talking about?
What future?

1058
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:02,685
Reuben, come on.
This is a fling, you know?

1059
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:05,229
What, did you think
we'd get married?

1060
01:07:05,313 --> 01:07:06,772
Whoa! Maybe.

1061
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:09,692
I was gonna ask you
to move in with me first.

1062
01:07:09,776 --> 01:07:13,320
You expect me to move to the
suburbs with you? Are you insane?

1063
01:07:13,947 --> 01:07:16,281
Why is that so crazy?
People do that all the time.

1064
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:20,202
They have kids, they make plans,
they get married, they buy houses.

1065
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:22,204
That's you, Reuben. You do that.

1066
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:24,790
That's what you do.
I don't live my life that way.

1067
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:27,501
Is your lack of a plan
that different than my plan?

1068
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:30,796
- I don't have a plan.
- You're on the non-plan plan.

1069
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:34,007
- I am not on a non-plan plan.
- You are, too.

1070
01:07:34,092 --> 01:07:36,593
I've never met anybody
more afraid of commitment.

1071
01:07:36,678 --> 01:07:39,930
You were a senior delegate
at the Model UN, Polly.

1072
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:41,765
What the hell happened to you?

1073
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:49,356
Come on, you mother!
You can do better than that!

1074
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:51,442
I've been living my life, okay?

1075
01:07:51,526 --> 01:07:54,403
I've been in good relationships
and in shitty ones.

1076
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:58,031
And I've moved a lot
and I've been happy and sad

1077
01:07:58,116 --> 01:08:00,159
and lonely and that's what
I've been doing.

1078
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:02,453
Which is more than I can say
for some freak

1079
01:08:02,537 --> 01:08:05,873
who thinks he'll get Ebola virus
from a bowl of mixed nuts.

1080
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:08,584
Those nuts have pee on them!
It's common sense.

1081
01:08:08,668 --> 01:08:11,837
Trust me, that is so far
beyond common sense.

1082
01:08:14,716 --> 01:08:16,550
You don't understand
what I grew up with.

1083
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:18,302
My mother made me
afraid of everything.

1084
01:08:18,386 --> 01:08:21,722
Big deal, Reuben.
My dad had a whole second family.

1085
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:24,057
- What?
- Yeah, on Long Island.

1086
01:08:24,142 --> 01:08:27,311
A wife and kids
and a golden retriever.

1087
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,188
A second family?

1088
01:08:30,148 --> 01:08:32,483
Whatever. Hey, you know what?

1089
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:36,570
I'm glad I saw that. I am.

1090
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:40,783
Because I'm going to make this
really easy for you, Reuben.

1091
01:08:40,867 --> 01:08:43,744
I have no interest...

1092
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:47,331
in getting married
and moving to the suburbs.

1093
01:08:47,415 --> 01:08:50,000
And obviously that's
really important to you.

1094
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:52,544
So here's what I think
your new plan should be.

1095
01:08:52,629 --> 01:08:56,131
You should get back together
with Lisa, move into your house

1096
01:08:56,216 --> 01:08:57,841
and move on with your life.

1097
01:08:57,926 --> 01:09:01,220
And I think you guys
will be really happy together.

1098
01:09:01,805 --> 01:09:03,013
Oh, dear Lord.

1099
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:11,939
You're not making my job
any easier, Leland.

1100
01:09:12,023 --> 01:09:15,526
Come on, Reub.
Weather report said sunny skies.

1101
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:49,393
Hey, it's Polly Prince.

1102
01:09:49,519 --> 01:09:52,980
Leave me a message,
or call back, or not.

1103
01:09:53,064 --> 01:09:55,065
You know, whatever. Okay, bye.

1104
01:09:55,149 --> 01:09:57,609
Hey, Polly, it's me. Listen...

1105
01:09:58,069 --> 01:10:01,697
I'd like to talk to you, because I
feel bad about what happened.

1106
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:04,074
Give me a call on my cell phone.

1107
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:20,632
- Hello?
- Hi. It's Lisa.

1108
01:10:23,344 --> 01:10:25,178
So, how's the house?

1109
01:10:25,847 --> 01:10:27,848
The house is great.

1110
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:31,059
It's big, but, you know, great.

1111
01:10:31,269 --> 01:10:34,730
I can't wait to see it.
Did you get the gift I sent you?

1112
01:10:34,814 --> 01:10:36,523
Yeah, I did. Thanks.

1113
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,192
I really want to see you.

1114
01:10:40,528 --> 01:10:42,321
I don't know, Lisa.

1115
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:44,114
Let me think about it.

1116
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:49,786
Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

1117
01:10:49,871 --> 01:10:53,040
The premiere of Jesus Christ
Superstar is about to begin.

1118
01:10:53,124 --> 01:10:55,417
Hey, Reuby Tuesday!

1119
01:10:56,544 --> 01:10:58,211
- ¿Cómo estás?
- What are you doing here?

1120
01:10:58,296 --> 01:11:01,214
What else? Hector's playing
keyboards in the band.

1121
01:11:01,299 --> 01:11:03,342
I didn't figure you a fan
of musical theatre.

1122
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:06,094
My friend Sandy Lyle is in the show.

1123
01:11:06,471 --> 01:11:08,931
Have you talked to Polly?

1124
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:13,185
She was upset, bro.
It must've been some kind of fight.

1125
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:16,146
Yeah, I keep calling her
and she won't pick up the phone.

1126
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:19,733
I don't know, I was thinking about
maybe dropping by tomorrow.

1127
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:23,320
It's a bit too late, papi.
She's leaving town in two hours.

1128
01:11:23,738 --> 01:11:24,947
What?

1129
01:11:25,907 --> 01:11:26,990
Why? Where is she going?

1130
01:11:27,075 --> 01:11:29,618
I don't know. She said goodbye.
That's it.

1131
01:11:29,911 --> 01:11:33,080
- Hi, I'm sorry I'm late.
- No, yeah. Hi.

1132
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:39,086
Hey, Javi, this is Lisa, my wife.

1133
01:11:57,981 --> 01:12:02,025
Her mother told me she was back.
You're doing the right thing here.

1134
01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:05,696
- Relax. I'm not promising anything.
- It's very exciting.

1135
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:13,912
Reuben, Stan. Change of plan.

1136
01:12:13,997 --> 01:12:17,416
The meeting with Van Lew's board
and AFLAC has moved to 4:00.

1137
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,167
4:00? I don't know if I can do that.

1138
01:12:19,252 --> 01:12:21,878
What's wrong with you?
Get your ass over here!

1139
01:12:21,963 --> 01:12:24,506
Good evening, folks.
I'm Sandy Lyle

1140
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:27,092
and I've got
a very special announcement.

1141
01:12:27,385 --> 01:12:29,302
Please note
that in tonight's performance,

1142
01:12:29,387 --> 01:12:33,348
in addition to playing Judas,
I'll be playing Jesus as well.

1143
01:12:33,433 --> 01:12:35,684
Thank you and enjoy the show.

1144
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:38,228
Sandy, what are you doing?
Wonsuk is playing Jesus.

1145
01:12:38,312 --> 01:12:41,023
It's cool. I'll play dual roles.
Give me the crown, Wonsuk.

1146
01:12:41,107 --> 01:12:43,150
Screw you, Sandy,
you're a has-been.

1147
01:12:43,234 --> 01:12:45,610
No one even cares
you were in that stupid movie.

1148
01:12:45,695 --> 01:12:47,279
- Oh, no.
- Oh, shit!

1149
01:12:50,324 --> 01:12:51,742
Judas is biting me!

1150
01:12:54,412 --> 01:12:55,787
What happened in there?

1151
01:12:55,872 --> 01:12:59,958
I'm a professional and I won't put
my reputation on the line

1152
01:13:00,043 --> 01:13:02,085
for a group of freaking amateurs.

1153
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:05,380
It's always the same story
with you, pal.

1154
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:10,552
You did this one movie
a hundred years ago.

1155
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:14,473
From then on, you thought you were
better than everybody else.

1156
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:17,601
Why don't you let go,
move on with your life?

1157
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:20,729
It's not about
what happened in the past

1158
01:13:20,813 --> 01:13:22,939
or what you think
might happen in the future.

1159
01:13:23,024 --> 01:13:25,525
It's about the ride,
for Christ's sake.

1160
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:29,237
There's no point in going through
all this crap

1161
01:13:29,322 --> 01:13:31,239
if you don't enjoy the ride.

1162
01:13:31,532 --> 01:13:32,699
And you know what?

1163
01:13:32,784 --> 01:13:36,286
When you least expect it,
something great might come along.

1164
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:38,955
Something better than
you even planned for.

1165
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:45,045
You were funny as hell
playing those bagpipes, though.

1166
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:47,714
Did I ever tell you that?

1167
01:13:48,549 --> 01:13:51,927
I don't think I've ever heard you
speak before, Mr. Feffer.

1168
01:13:57,934 --> 01:14:02,312
So, Reuby, are we going to grab
a bite after your work thingamajigy?

1169
01:14:03,106 --> 01:14:04,731
No, Lisa...

1170
01:14:05,817 --> 01:14:08,485
I shouldn't have asked you
to come down here.

1171
01:14:08,736 --> 01:14:11,113
I'm not getting back together
with you.

1172
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:13,824
What are you talking about?

1173
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:15,534
- Why?
- "Why?"

1174
01:14:17,745 --> 01:14:20,872
You screwed a scuba-diving
instructor on our honeymoon.

1175
01:14:21,541 --> 01:14:26,002
What kind of cold, heartless bitch
would do that to someone they love?

1176
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:30,924
I'd have to be an idiot to get back
together with you after that.

1177
01:14:31,884 --> 01:14:35,220
And by the way, I destroyed
all your little throw pillows.

1178
01:14:35,388 --> 01:14:38,890
Yeah, because throw pillows suck.
They serve no purpose.

1179
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:40,767
They're purely decorative.

1180
01:14:44,939 --> 01:14:47,107
Dude, that was incredible!

1181
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:50,026
You told me I should get back
together with her.

1182
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:53,113
Whatever you do, don't ever take
my advice again.

1183
01:14:53,197 --> 01:14:55,407
Your dad totally put it
in perspective for me.

1184
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:59,411
I was barely famous back then,
and I'll never be famous again.

1185
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:02,205
What about your
E! True Hollywood Story?

1186
01:15:02,290 --> 01:15:05,584
The E! Channel doesn't even know
we're making this show.

1187
01:15:05,793 --> 01:15:07,294
What do you mean?

1188
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:09,671
I hired Dustin and Vic myself.

1189
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:13,842
I was going to try and sell it
to the network when I'm done.

1190
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:18,763
You're doing an
E! True Hollywood Story on yourself?

1191
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:23,101
Sandy, that's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

1192
01:15:23,186 --> 01:15:25,270
I know. I'm such a loser.

1193
01:15:31,152 --> 01:15:34,446
I need you to do something for me
that's really important

1194
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:36,907
so promise me, this one time
you won't screw it up.

1195
01:15:36,991 --> 01:15:39,075
Reuben, I'm your wingman.

1196
01:15:39,202 --> 01:15:41,786
Whatever it is,
I will not let you down.

1197
01:15:42,121 --> 01:15:44,664
You're Reuben's proxy?
What the hell does that mean?

1198
01:15:44,749 --> 01:15:46,875
He's dealing with
a personal situation,

1199
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:50,712
so he asked me to fill in.
Relax, I'm a professional actor.

1200
01:15:50,796 --> 01:15:52,505
They will never know the difference.

1201
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:56,509
- I can't freaking believe this.
- Quiet. I'm trying to prepare.

1202
01:16:01,349 --> 01:16:02,515
I'm going to vomit.

1203
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:15,695
I am so sorry
for the delay, folks...

1204
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:19,199
but one of our senior analysts,
Reuben Feffer,

1205
01:16:19,283 --> 01:16:22,994
had his spleen burst
just a few moments ago and...

1206
01:16:23,162 --> 01:16:25,664
- That's not good. Will he be okay?
- God willing.

1207
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:28,875
Be that as it may, we have
Mr. Feffer's associate here...

1208
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:32,045
Mr. Sanford Lyle,
who's been briefed on the case

1209
01:16:32,129 --> 01:16:34,673
and will present
Reuben's recommendations.

1210
01:16:35,049 --> 01:16:36,591
Thank you, Stanley.

1211
01:16:45,685 --> 01:16:47,519
I just need a little water.

1212
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:02,993
As you know, this is a highly
complex case.

1213
01:17:05,204 --> 01:17:06,871
Let me see here.

1214
01:17:11,544 --> 01:17:15,672
On the plus side, Leland's
blood pressure is pretty solid.

1215
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:19,175
And he's at a decent weight.

1216
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:22,095
And he looks
pretty damn healthy, right?

1217
01:17:22,513 --> 01:17:24,389
I mean, he's a sexy guy.

1218
01:17:24,682 --> 01:17:25,724
Right?

1219
01:17:25,933 --> 01:17:29,519
And he is sexually active
in the community.

1220
01:17:45,202 --> 01:17:46,244
Polly!

1221
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:48,121
JFK, please.

1222
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:21,780
Let's not bullcrap each other.

1223
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:25,533
On paper, Van Lew is one of
the riskiest sons of bitches alive.

1224
01:18:25,785 --> 01:18:28,870
But, people,
we cannot sum up a man's life

1225
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:32,123
with a bunch of numbers
on a computer screen.

1226
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:35,585
We all need to look
into our hearts and go,

1227
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:39,631
"Do I think this dude is going
to die in a few years or not?"

1228
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:45,011
Is Leland here going to fight off
a man with the last name Reaper...

1229
01:18:45,262 --> 01:18:48,973
first name...
Who goes by the last name Reaper...

1230
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:50,975
first name Grim?

1231
01:18:51,268 --> 01:18:53,520
Or will this BASE-jumping...

1232
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:58,233
crocodile-wrestling...

1233
01:18:58,651 --> 01:19:00,235
shark-diving...

1234
01:19:00,903 --> 01:19:03,071
volcano-luging...

1235
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:06,324
bear-fighting, snake-wrangling...

1236
01:19:06,409 --> 01:19:09,619
motocross-racing bastard die?

1237
01:19:10,329 --> 01:19:11,996
And the answer...

1238
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:14,499
is no, friends.

1239
01:19:14,792 --> 01:19:17,001
Which is why myself...

1240
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,922
Reuben Feffer, Stan...

1241
01:19:22,508 --> 01:19:25,385
and all of us here
at Indurby & Friends,

1242
01:19:25,469 --> 01:19:27,887
are willing to lay our asses
on the line

1243
01:19:27,972 --> 01:19:30,765
and proudly recommend
that Leland Van Lew

1244
01:19:30,850 --> 01:19:33,226
receive $50 million,

1245
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:36,396
in life and health
and automobile insurance,

1246
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:40,483
for a duration
of no less than 20 years.

1247
01:19:44,321 --> 01:19:46,364
What do you think, guys?

1248
01:19:48,868 --> 01:19:51,578
Are you that kid
from Crocodile Tears?

1249
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:57,584
- You're goddamn right I am.
- I thought so.

1250
01:19:57,918 --> 01:20:00,295
Impressive presentation.
He's insured.

1251
01:20:00,754 --> 01:20:03,506
- Congratulations.
- Bloody ripper!

1252
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:05,508
Love you, son!

1253
01:20:16,228 --> 01:20:17,812
Rodolfo, wait!

1254
01:20:18,731 --> 01:20:20,398
I'm so sorry!

1255
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:30,074
Reuben, it's too late. I have to be
on a plane in 45 minutes.

1256
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:32,118
I don't think
you really want to leave here.

1257
01:20:32,203 --> 01:20:34,454
You have no idea what I want.

1258
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:37,999
You left Rodolfo behind.
Does that mean anything?

1259
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:43,087
I made a mistake. I should've
never put you in the Riskmaster.

1260
01:20:43,172 --> 01:20:45,590
Truth is, no matter what happened
on our honeymoon,

1261
01:20:45,674 --> 01:20:48,218
- you're much riskier than Lisa.
- Yes! Right!

1262
01:20:48,302 --> 01:20:50,470
That's why it won't work out
between us.

1263
01:20:50,554 --> 01:20:53,640
Reuben, you're a nice,
safe, conventional guy.

1264
01:20:53,724 --> 01:20:55,892
It's not going to work out.

1265
01:20:56,143 --> 01:20:57,769
I don't think
that's who I really am.

1266
01:20:57,853 --> 01:21:00,396
It is. That's okay.

1267
01:21:00,481 --> 01:21:03,274
What do I have to do
to prove it to you?

1268
01:21:05,611 --> 01:21:07,654
What are you... Oh, my God.

1269
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:11,241
Hey, look! Look, I'm eating nuts.

1270
01:21:12,284 --> 01:21:15,328
- What are you doing?
- Those nuts aren't even dirty?

1271
01:21:22,962 --> 01:21:26,047
Since we've been together,
I've felt more uncomfortable,

1272
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:29,676
out of place, embarrassed
and just physically sick

1273
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,261
than in my entire life.

1274
01:21:31,345 --> 01:21:33,304
But I couldn't have
gone through all that...

1275
01:21:33,389 --> 01:21:36,432
I couldn't have thrown up
19 times in 48 days...

1276
01:21:37,851 --> 01:21:40,144
if I wasn't in love with you.

1277
01:21:43,482 --> 01:21:46,067
Maybe you're right.
Maybe this is just a fling.

1278
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:49,195
But if you get on that plane
and go to Cincinnati or Tanzania

1279
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:52,532
or wherever, we'll never know
if it could've been more.

1280
01:21:55,244 --> 01:21:56,494
Oh, no.

1281
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:11,342
Please don't eat those.

1282
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:14,345
No, really.

1283
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:25,064
I don't want you to go away.

1284
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:29,986
- I'm not going to marry you.
- I don't want to get married.

1285
01:22:30,696 --> 01:22:33,239
I just want to take you to dinner.

1286
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:35,325
Sometime this week.

1287
01:22:40,831 --> 01:22:42,707
Can I pick the place?

1288
01:22:57,848 --> 01:22:59,057
Solid!

1289
01:23:01,518 --> 01:23:03,394
Excuse me. Hi. Hello.

1290
01:23:03,729 --> 01:23:07,398
I see you two are new to the island.
I want to come have a meet...

1291
01:23:07,483 --> 01:23:09,567
Oh, my stars and stripe, Reuben!

1292
01:23:09,652 --> 01:23:12,111
Oh, my God,
I cannot believe it is you.

1293
01:23:12,196 --> 01:23:14,530
- This is Polly.
- Hi, Polly. I am Claude.

1294
01:23:14,615 --> 01:23:16,240
Wow, hi.

1295
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:17,909
So, how's it going?

1296
01:23:18,077 --> 01:23:21,954
In truth, it has been a little bit
tough noogies for me.

1297
01:23:22,122 --> 01:23:25,166
Lisa, she broke my heart.

1298
01:23:25,417 --> 01:23:28,378
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- That is life.

1299
01:23:29,421 --> 01:23:31,714
Well, you have to be like the hippo.

1300
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,008
Exactly. Like the hippo.

1301
01:23:34,927 --> 01:23:38,054
So, let me guess.
You are here on honeymoon again?

1302
01:23:38,138 --> 01:23:41,849
- This is your beautiful bride?
- No, we're just hanging out.

1303
01:23:41,934 --> 01:23:45,353
- It's more serious than that.
- I'm just saying we're not married.

1304
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:47,772
Right. Definitely not married.
But it's possible.

1305
01:23:47,856 --> 01:23:48,940
It is possible.

1306
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:52,402
We're taking things step by step,
seeing how they work out.

1307
01:23:52,486 --> 01:23:55,613
I don't really understand
what you're talking about...

1308
01:23:55,906 --> 01:23:57,949
but any chance
you're for scuba today?

1309
01:23:58,033 --> 01:24:00,118
You know what,
actually we are for scuba.

1310
01:24:00,202 --> 01:24:02,620
- No way, José!
- Yes way, José!

1311
01:24:02,705 --> 01:24:05,289
But, we're going out with that guy.

1312
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:09,168
We'll be out there in a minute!

1313
01:24:10,129 --> 01:24:13,297
You know what? As long as
you're for scuba, I am happy.

1314
01:24:13,674 --> 01:24:15,466
Oh, that's sweet.

1315
01:24:15,551 --> 01:24:17,510
So, au revoir, my good friend.

1316
01:24:19,513 --> 01:24:22,014
Thank you for everything, Claude.

1317
01:24:22,474 --> 01:24:25,143
It's good to see you again.
Good-bye, Polly.

1318
01:24:25,602 --> 01:24:28,104
- Nice to meet you, Claude.
- You, as well.

1319
01:24:30,441 --> 01:24:32,817
- So you're ready?
- Let's do it!
