Philippe!

00:03:46,756 --> 00:03:49,788
I can't breathe!

00:03:53,313 --> 00:03:56,148
I can't breathe!

5
00:04:00,059 --> 00:04:01,930
Can you help me?

6
00:04:03,964 --> 00:04:06,017
Can you help me please?

7
00:04:30,422 --> 00:04:32,939
Help me! Please!

Hey! You know what you are?

00:09:55,557 --> 00:09:57,138
You know what you are?

36
00:10:01,008 --> 00:10:03,154
You're the devil!

37

Do you know what that means?

38
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:17,999
That means that you won't even...

have a chance... going to hell!

40

I don't understand
what difference it makes.

I am afraid of time

56
00:14:34,063 --> 00:14:37,450
It seems to me like a pan
without a handle

57
00:14:39,575 --> 00:14:42,111
A sign without light

58
00:14:43,724 --> 00:14:46,704
Disappearing,
looking at my back

59
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,880
that bends and breaks

60
00:14:53,203 --> 00:14:54,884
When the clouds

61
00:14:55,674 --> 00:14:57,852
at daybreak

62

Mercy on my left!

111
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,031
There is no mercy!

112
00:21:52,692 --> 00:21:55,053
There is no justice!

113
00:22:02,944 --> 00:22:04,869
The sea shall rise...

114
00:22:05,376 --> 00:22:09,930
Over your head and drown you all!

115
00:22:11,148 --> 00:22:12,980
All of you!

<i>To his spirit I confess</i>

<i>I don't recognize
the scream of jubilation</i>

122
00:23:50,598 --> 00:23:55,290
<i>That destroys
the holy peace for me</i>

123
00:23:55,291 --> 00:24:00,242
<i>His silent mouth,
his sleeping chest</i>

124
00:24:00,243 --> 00:24:05,500
<i>Awaiting delicately
for sweet desire</i>

125

O King, let yourself be guided
across this wide beach.

128
00:28:50,674 --> 00:28:55,464
Let me keep you company.
Take my hand.

129
00:28:56,549 --> 00:29:01,881
I want to give you everything
that's keeping me alive.

130
00:29:03,674 --> 00:29:05,457
Desire...

131
00:29:07,341 --> 00:29:10,522
Your gaze reaching inside my tent.

132
00:30:34,507 --> 00:30:35,922
Sheila.

133
00:30:42,832 --> 00:30:44,172
Sheila.

134
00:30:52,729 --> 00:30:54,059
Sheila!

135
00:32:58,783 --> 00:33:01,463
We can never be here.

136
00:33:02,879 --> 00:33:06,226
We can never be here
until we're gone.

137
00:33:11,276 --> 00:33:13,484
We can never be here.

138
00:33:14,731 --> 00:33:16,965
Not until we're gone.

139
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:26,149
You know that.

140
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:34,266
You know that.

141
00:33:35,732 --> 00:33:37,949
We can never be here.

142
00:33:38,526 --> 00:33:40,896
Not until we're gone.

143
00:33:51,499 --> 00:33:53,678
Not until we're gone.

144
00:41:36,591 --> 00:41:38,561
Little father of the people!

145
00:41:40,824 --> 00:41:42,384
I salute you!

146
00:41:43,674 --> 00:41:46,697
I've come from a faraway star
called earth.

147
00:41:47,549 --> 00:41:50,439
I've brought you this modest gift,

148
00:41:51,216 --> 00:41:53,215
that can triumph at last,

149
00:41:53,216 --> 00:41:59,022
so that love and peace,
too often drowned in blood...

150
00:41:59,882 --> 00:42:02,439
I salute you, child of nature.

151
00:42:02,716 --> 00:42:05,772
And your descendants,

152
00:42:05,799 --> 00:42:08,439
and yourself, eternity!

153
00:44:43,774 --> 00:44:46,093
He gave me my senses.

154
00:44:47,698 --> 00:44:49,789
He gave me my pride.

155
00:44:51,705 --> 00:44:55,644
But my eye must betray
what it sees through the light.

156
00:45:19,426 --> 00:45:21,618
I beg you to stay.

157
00:45:24,717 --> 00:45:26,859
I will give you a name.

158
00:45:33,043 --> 00:45:36,007
A name you can remember me by.

159
00:51:26,757 --> 00:51:29,939
And if your crown falls into the sea

160
00:51:30,757 --> 00:51:33,264
I'll get up again

161
00:51:35,216 --> 00:51:38,322
Wait on the other side

162
00:51:40,882 --> 00:51:43,847
where your path awaits you!

163
00:54:04,632 --> 00:54:06,981
And no-one will ask me

164
00:54:07,382 --> 00:54:09,397
for the answer

165
00:54:10,882 --> 00:54:16,064
I could tell you
but the secret holds me back

166
00:54:18,841 --> 00:54:24,147
Strength depends on this magic,
the power to lose oneself

167
00:54:32,799 --> 00:54:35,322
Wherever there's a way out

168
00:54:36,289 --> 00:54:38,642
follow its lead.

169
00:55:21,207 --> 00:55:28,941
<i>O King, may you lead</i>

170
00:55:29,454 --> 00:55:36,213
<i>Let me accompany you</i>

171
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:42,928
<i>O King, may you lead</i>

172
