1
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:44,563
- Hold it, boys, hold it!

2
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,649
Before we get out, let's
remember the agreement.

3
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:47,733
- Set your
brakes, turn your lights off

4
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:50,528
and take your keys with you if you wish.

5
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,613
- Now, one hour.

6
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:54,365
It is now 11:00 p.m.

7
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:57,743
One hour, then we all leave quietly,

8
00:01:58,035 --> 00:01:58,994
no matter how much money you've won

9
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,830
or how many girls you've met.

10
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:02,414
I repeat for the record, one hour.

11
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:05,543
- Has there ever been
such a college boy before?

12
00:02:05,835 --> 00:02:07,461
- So anxious to get back to his studies

13
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:09,046
that the thought of winning $10,000

14
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:11,215
at a crap table merely disgusts him.

15
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:12,675
- It could be that girl, too.

16
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:13,509
- Who's that?

17
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:14,385
- That heavenly girl.

18
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:15,261
- Hey.
- What does he care

19
00:02:15,553 --> 00:02:17,805
about girls when he can
shack up with his law books?

20
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:19,473
- One hour.

21
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:20,307
- Not what you'd call

22
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,893
an interesting conversationalist, is he?

23
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:58,596
- Your old daddy flew one
of those in the war, son.

24
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:00,472
- And was that how you
were killed in action, sir?

25
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:01,473
- Yes, indeed.

26
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:15,154
- I don't want to bother you, boys,

27
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:16,989
but it is now 11:03.

28
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:19,491
- Yeah, man, let's go where the money is.

29
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:20,659
- Yeah, man.

30
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:37,384
- Is this the place where the people live

31
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:38,552
who want to give us all this money?

32
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:40,012
- This must be the place.

33
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:42,598
This is my infallible roulette system.

34
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:43,933
- Now, he has a system.

35
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:44,892
- Well, if you've got a system,

36
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:46,685
you might as well get
it out of your system.

37
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:47,561
That's what I always say.

38
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:49,647
- And you know, he always does say that!

39
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:51,023
- Sir, I wonder if you'd arrange

40
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:52,233
to have a Brink's armored car

41
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:53,901
at the side door in about an hour?

42
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:56,528
I expect to be making a
gold shipment about then.

43
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:58,822
- We're his male nurses.

44
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:03,369
- Ready?

45
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:05,120
- Is everybody all right?

46
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:06,914
- Come on,
time to make a million.

47
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:08,415
- Right, last round.

48
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:09,917
Five and 10.

49
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,295
- Excuse me.

50
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:16,382
- Dear, are you serious?

51
00:04:16,674 --> 00:04:18,425
- No it looks strange.

52
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,469
- Here they go, lucky!

53
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,352
- On the right.
- Hold 'em off.

54
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,525
- He hit the top.
- Oh yeah.

55
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:36,527
- Here they go.
- Deal me!

56
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:40,072
- Is that right?

57
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:42,866
- Well, pay me double, you in?

58
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:44,660
- Deal a round.

59
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:53,502
- You got seven, now 37.

60
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:54,670
- Hey!

61
00:04:56,547 --> 00:04:58,382
- What's going around there?

62
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:02,011
- Madam, would you give up
this sinful life of gambling

63
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:03,887
if the right man came along?

64
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:05,014
- I might, yes.

65
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:07,016
- Excuse me.

66
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:09,310
How's the play?

67
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,770
- I put it down, they pick it up.

68
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,273
- Maybe you ain't putting
it down in the right place.

69
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:16,108
- That could explain it.

70
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,568
Aren't you playing?

71
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,402
- Well, I'd like to,

72
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:20,029
but I just get a nosebleed every time

73
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:22,114
I see that happening to my money.

74
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:23,949
- Does it bother you when
it's my money that's going?

75
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:27,328
- No, not as long as you can
assure me you got plenty more.

76
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,998
- One red.

77
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,334
- Do you mind my standing here?

78
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,919
- I haven't called for a guard, have I?

79
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,505
- No, they just get in the way.

80
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:41,550
- All right, bub, six
you want now, six you in.

81
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:42,551
- Jackpot!

82
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:45,095
- Deal a round.

83
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:50,267
- R152, the giant jackpot,
$50, a bonus, R152.

84
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:52,644
- Good luck to you, sir.

85
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:53,896
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

86
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,106
- You must lead a clean life.

87
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:59,443
- Yeah, and up until now
it's been driving me crazy.

88
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:04,656
- 21 red.

89
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:08,410
- I know this system is infallible

90
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,120
because I worked it out myself.

91
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,165
Do you suppose I could
be reading it wrong?

92
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:16,919
- Deal me another hand.

93
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:19,922
- Oh five, five's enough for mine.

94
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:24,426
- On the slots.

95
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:25,719
I win.

96
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,304
- Yeah.

97
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:28,138
- Oh, boy!

98
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,223
Now I can buy that atom-powered

99
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:30,849
steam shovel I've always wanted.

100
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,101
- With that?

101
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,983
- And of course it was
completely ridiculous.

102
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:41,568
I didn't know she was a countess.

103
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,403
- 8 and three.

104
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,488
- So it was right after that
my poor old gray-haired mother

105
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,573
said to me, she said, Brick, son,

106
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:49,243
I just know you're gonna be
terribly attractive to women.

107
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:51,995
And I do so hope you're not
going to be a beast about it.

108
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,039
- Tell me, have you been a beast about it?

109
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:54,957
- Well, certainly.

110
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:56,834
What did my poor old gray-haired
mother know about fun?

111
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:00,003
It is now 11:19.

112
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:01,713
- Thank you, thank you.

113
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:04,842
I don't like to wear a watch.

114
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:05,968
I hired him to follow me around

115
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:06,927
and tell me what time it is.

116
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:08,679
- All right, here we come now.
- Hey!

117
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:10,973
- 25 red.
- Hit me.

118
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:12,099
- What's going down there?

119
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:14,685
- Hit twice, there.

120
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,479
- Out of the way.

121
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,481
If you don't live here,
get out of the way.

122
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:20,941
- You let me know.

123
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,484
- Well, this is it!

124
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:23,318
- Didn't you explain to him

125
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,736
that your system was infallible?

126
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,448
- I knew there was
someone I forgot to tell.

127
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,158
Well, I've got to cash a check.

128
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,077
- You know, only someone whose
father owned an oil company

129
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:32,953
could afford that system.

130
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:34,413
- You've always hated me

131
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:35,956
just because my family
has money, haven't you?

132
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:38,417
- No, I have a lot
better reasons than that.

133
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:41,044
Shew.

134
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:41,879
- Place your bets, please,

135
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:42,713
ladies and gentlemen.

136
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,633
Boys, it is now 11:21.

137
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:50,762
- The old lamplighter.

138
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,308
- Down the roll, well it looks good.

139
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,142
- Do you see that?

140
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:56,435
- Nine red, would appear.

141
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:58,896
- What, that mirror?

142
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:00,522
- You know what that's for?

143
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,150
- Yeah, so tall Texans can
see to comb their hair.

144
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,944
- Those are observation posts.

145
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,071
Guards sit up there and
keep an eye on things.

146
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:15,287
- Alright, gentlemen,

147
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:16,872
six you wanted, six you in.

148
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,499
- Four, too, please.

149
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,333
- Yes, 700, seven.
- Well we have--

150
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,210
- Pardon me.
- Hey!

151
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:22,044
- You're on five.

152
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:23,045
- I'm writing a new telephone book,

153
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:24,463
and I'd like to include
your name and number.

154
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:26,423
- Eight, six and out.

155
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:27,424
- Shew.

156
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:29,009
- I don't know if he told you,

157
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:30,802
but he's only 13 years old.

158
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:31,970
- Be gone, son.

159
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,266
I am the oldest 13 you'll ever run into.

160
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:39,978
- They're cute.

161
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:40,896
- 16, see.

162
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:42,773
- Hold it off.

163
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:43,607
- I don't understand.

164
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:45,484
- I understand, I know what it is.

165
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:47,236
- Oh I don't know.
- You don't understand?

166
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,280
- Tell me.

167
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,492
- Will you pardon me, please?

168
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:54,326
Excuse me.

169
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:57,746
- I'll need one of those

170
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:58,914
when my system starts working.

171
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:00,916
- By then you'll be too old to push it.

172
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:06,421
- Turn to your left side.

173
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,048
- Can you handle that for me?

174
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,843
Don't make me have to shoot!

175
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:12,719
- How would you like it, sir?

176
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:14,263
Any particular denomination?

177
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:15,514
- Any denomination will do.

178
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:24,773
- Cashier number three.

179
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,525
Guy in a gray suit and gray hat.

180
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:28,527
Two guys backing him up.

181
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:31,655
The gun's in the magazine he's holding.

182
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,532
- Take two.

183
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:35,075
- The dice is coming right now,

184
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:36,577
coming right out on the old come out roll.

185
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:37,411
- Seven wins.

186
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:38,370
- Come on honey, you win.

187
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:40,247
- You win on the seven.

188
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:41,081
- Just hand us that magazine.

189
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:43,166
- What magazine, what's going on here?

190
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,126
- Yeah, what's going on?

191
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,628
- Take it easy and no one'll get hurt.

192
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,879
Hand me that check, please.

193
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:54,970
$5,000 or I'll blow your head off.

194
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,849
Okay, friend, let's not
disturb the customers.

195
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:01,184
- On five.
- Where is this?

196
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:03,854
- Five in the house.

197
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:06,106
- You're a mad man.

198
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,233
- I win.

199
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,611
- Yeah.
- I usual deal low nine.

200
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:12,529
- Under nine.

201
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,292
- Hey, wait a minute,

202
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:26,918
who's in charge here?
- Who's asking?

203
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:27,753
- I'm asking.

204
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:28,670
What are you arresting them for?

205
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,005
- These characters have flipped, Al.

206
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:31,089
- He's behind in his quota for the night.

207
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,050
- Shut up, both of you.

208
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:34,676
- I asked you why you were arresting them.

209
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:35,636
- Who are you?

210
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:36,470
- A friend of theirs.

211
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:37,512
We're on our way back

212
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,556
to Midwestern University from summer jobs.

213
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:42,934
We stopped in here to have
a drink and a few laughs.

214
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:43,935
- Well?

215
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:46,146
- Tell him the truth!

216
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:48,649
- Now there's a real democratic guy.

217
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,483
He hates everybody.

218
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:51,360
- Look, I told you we were students!

219
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:53,403
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, I'm not kidding.

220
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:55,489
We don't have anything to do with him.

221
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:59,951
All right, show them your
last year's students' cards.

222
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,411
- I never saw them before.

223
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:06,875
- Sorry, boys, one of those things.

224
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:08,710
- What happened in there?

225
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,962
- The man tried a real crazy stunt.

226
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,215
- Attempted robbery, he means.

227
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:16,134
- Who would be crazy enough
to try and rob Harold's place?

228
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:16,968
- Are you kidding?

229
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,221
- 'Cause that's where the money is.

230
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:21,682
- 10,000 people a day gamble in there.

231
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:24,643
Every now and then, some wise
Joe figures a smart angle.

232
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:27,771
It'd be easier to knock off Fort Knox.

233
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,691
There's no way it could be done!

234
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:36,238
- Well, gentlemen.

235
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,365
- Dad, you missed out on all the fun.

236
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:39,533
- I did not.

237
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:44,079
I would like to make one of
my deathless remarks now.

238
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,331
There may be some things better than sex,

239
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:50,752
some worse, but there's
nothing quite like it.

240
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,380
- That was kind of a
deathless remark at that.

241
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:54,339
It is now 10 minutes to 12:00,

242
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,174
or don't you care anymore?

243
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:57,509
- Well, let's hop in the old car,

244
00:11:57,801 --> 00:11:58,552
drive back to the old college,

245
00:11:58,844 --> 00:11:59,636
dig into those old studies,

246
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:00,470
and start taking out

247
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:02,264
those old, old, old college
gals again!

248
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:03,098
You with me?

249
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,851
- Yeah, but I wish
everybody didn't know it.

256
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:31,168
- Sure, it's an excerpt
from Beethoven's 12th.

257
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,544
- Beethoven must have written that one

258
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:33,962
underwater with broken pencils.

259
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,214
- Broken fingers, where are we anyway?

260
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:37,340
- Now he wants to know where he is!

261
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:38,633
- Kansas someplace.

262
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,343
- 300 miles to go.

263
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:41,386
- What are you loafing for?

264
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:42,971
- 85 miles an hour is loafing?

265
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:46,099
- Anything going 85 miles
an hour is a guided missile.

266
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,185
Are you still worrying
about getting back to Kay?

267
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:49,102
Now what has she got?

268
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:49,978
- I'll tell you what she's got--

269
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,480
- Hold it, don't tell him, don't tell him.

270
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:52,314
- Why?

271
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:53,648
- I don't want him to know.

272
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,483
- Oh, yeah.

273
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:55,942
- Hey, about that cop in Reno

274
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:58,195
saying you couldn't rob Harold's Club.

275
00:12:58,487 --> 00:12:59,738
What did he mean it couldn't be done?

276
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:00,906
- Oh, beats me.

277
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:02,949
- Anything can be done.

278
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:06,578
Of course it could be done.

Good old Lincoln Hall.

285
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,456
- Be safe.
- Hi, Al.

286
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,208
- Hats off, freshman.

287
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,668
- What's your name, boy?

288
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,795
- It's Spieglebauer, sir,
Francis Spieglebauer.

289
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:59,506
- I see, well, son, men have overcome

290
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:00,507
greater handicaps than that.

291
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,759
But I have loose teeth, you see.

292
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,553
I think I'll just call you Spiegy, okay?

293
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:05,428
- Yes, sir.

294
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,263
- Good lad.

295
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:07,097
- Now hear this, Spiegy.

296
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:08,139
Every year we choose a freshman

297
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:09,766
to help us with a few
chores we have to have done.

298
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,351
- Since the work sort
of piled up last year,

299
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:12,894
they all thought we'd get
two freshmen this year,

300
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,021
but you look like you could
do the work of two men!

301
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:16,064
- Hat on, Spiegy.

302
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:19,484
- Now first, in there
is some of our luggage.

303
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:20,694
Suitcases, heavy articles.

304
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:21,695
In there is where we live.

305
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:25,365
Your job is to transport one
inside the other, understand?

306
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:27,033
- Are you sure I have to do this?

307
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:28,743
- Yes, I'm sure, are you sure?

308
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:29,870
- Oh, I'm sure.

309
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:31,621
- Well, what I mean is,

310
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:34,207
in the booklet that
the university sent me,

311
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:36,960
they said they didn't haze
freshmen here anymore.

312
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:38,545
- That's right, Spiegy.

313
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:40,755
You see, the fellows who wrote the booklet

314
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,257
don't haze freshmen here anymore.

315
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:43,091
- Oh.

316
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:43,967
- See?

317
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:45,135
Carry on, Spiegy.

318
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:46,052
- The keys, Spiegy.

319
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:47,137
- To work, Spiegy.

320
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:49,306
Shew.

321
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,858
- It's wonderful to hear
your voice again, Kay.

322
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:00,859
No, I mean it.

323
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:02,444
- Don't you think he'd be embarrassed

324
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:03,403
to talk like that in front of us?

325
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:04,529
- Just wait a minute.

326
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,364
No, I'm not embarrassed.

327
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:07,490
But if a couple of characters I know

328
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:08,825
don't stop listening in,

329
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,911
I may be crowded into a little violence.

330
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:11,912
- Ruffian.

331
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:16,458
- Hm, yeah, the Katzenjammer Kids, honey.

332
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,584
Oh, they're fine, fine.

333
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:20,253
A little more mentally
retarded perhaps, but fine.

334
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:24,049
Yeah, surprise?

335
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:26,718
Well, that makes me nervous.

336
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:28,386
Yeah, I wanted everything

337
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,639
just exactly the way it was when I left.

338
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,186
Come on, tell me about it.

339
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:45,445
- Look at him!

340
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:47,155
See how happy he is?

341
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:51,409
Why, just a few short hours ago,

342
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,453
he didn't know a soul in this college

343
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:56,039
and now he has friends!

344
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:58,708
I'm telling you, it makes a man appreciate

345
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,001
the American educational system.

346
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,629
- Spiegy, you see what
a deep thinker he is?

347
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:03,713
You should feel privileged

348
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,340
to know a man who thinks that deeply.

349
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:06,383
- Yes, sir.

350
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,177
Can I ask a question?

351
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,136
- Why not?

352
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:12,847
Why not spoil him just a little, go ahead.

353
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,182
- Well, the guys in the next room

354
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,309
said that Al and Brick
were in Korea together.

355
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:17,143
- So?

356
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:19,020
- Well, they said that
Brick saved AI's life.

357
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:19,854
- So?

358
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,356
- They said that Brick got a medal

359
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,108
and a bad head wound doing it.

360
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:23,942
- So?

361
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:25,276
- Well, so nothing.

362
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:26,778
That's what the guys
in the next room said.

363
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,029
- Don't pay any attention to them.

364
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,073
- They're drunk most of the time.

365
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:32,158
- Were you two guys in Korea?

366
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,535
- What's that?

367
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,996
- I said, were you two in Korea?

368
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:37,831
- Are you questioning our patriotism?

369
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:38,665
- Why, no, I--

370
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:39,666
- I suppose you think we
wouldn't have been there

371
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,167
if it hadn't been for
our liver conditions.

372
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:42,002
- I suppose you think it's fun

373
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:42,836
to have a liver condition

374
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:44,629
and never get to go to any
wars with the rest of the guys?

375
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:45,672
- Why, I didn't mean anything, I--

376
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:46,548
- You just better take it easy

377
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,091
and watch who you call yellow from now on.

378
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,175
- Whom.
- Yeah, whom.

379
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,301
- I didn't call whom yellow, I--

380
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:51,136
- Get on with your work, Spiegy.

381
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:52,470
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

382
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:54,305
Shew.

383
00:16:58,143 --> 00:16:59,019
How's Kay?

384
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,353
- She's got a surprise for me.

385
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,105
- Maybe she's turned into a boy.

386
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:02,939
- That girl?

387
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,900
- Wants me to meet her at
the Campus Club tonight.

388
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:06,943
Wonder what that could mean.

389
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:08,028
- Any number of things,

390
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,113
and none of them too good
from your standpoint.

391
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:10,947
- What are you talking about?

392
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:12,449
- Now I'm supposed to know
what I'm talking about!

393
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:14,034
- Oh, it would ruin all your charm.

394
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:15,660
- Hm-mm.
- Eh.

395
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:16,661
- Spiegy, don't just stand there.

396
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,038
Move, boy, move.

- I don't get it.

417
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:23,705
How did this happen?

418
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:25,707
- When we left, she was
working in a department store.

419
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:28,209
- This must be the surprise.

420
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:30,837
- Hi, Kay.

421
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:31,713
- Welcome home, boys.

422
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:32,964
- Hello, Kay.

423
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:36,801
I think you gentlemen made a mistake.

424
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:38,178
Your table's over there.

425
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:39,804
- He's ashamed of us.

426
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,681
- He wishes we were dead.

427
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:42,682
- That's right.

428
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,018
- I'll be back in a minute.

429
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,187
I want to get out of this singing dress.

430
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:49,772
- And you know, she's right.

431
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:51,524
That dress actually does sing.

432
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:55,028
- Why don't you guys go ahead and order,

433
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,821
I want to talk to Kay privately.

434
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:57,655
- What's with you?

435
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:58,990
You on a diet or something?

436
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:00,617
- Diet?

437
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:03,077
That's at least 2,500
calories he's following.

438
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,840
- Hey, when did all this happen?

439
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:17,508
- About two weeks ago.

440
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,343
It began as a joke.

441
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:21,262
Not that it hasn't gone
right on being that.

442
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:22,430
A bunch of us came in one night,

443
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,724
and someone dared me to get up and sing.

444
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:26,267
So you know me.

445
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,602
- I don't know whether I know you or not.

446
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:29,646
The girl I knew couldn't sing a note.

447
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:33,441
- Nothing's changed.

448
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,235
It's just that the
management thinks I can,

449
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,111
and they're willing to
pay for their opinions.

450
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:40,114
Now you tell me, how was the summer?

451
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:41,157
- I wrote you.

452
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:43,743
There has never been
such a long, long summer.

453
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:46,663
- Well, I'm glad to see that all the time

454
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:48,039
you were wasting away for me

455
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:48,873
you weren't forgetting to eat

456
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,166
some of those cows you were punching.

457
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,043
- Same old story, huh?

458
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:54,963
You just won't believe anything
I tell you about how I feel.

459
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:58,007
Don't you want me to feel the way I do?

460
00:20:58,299 --> 00:20:59,217
- I'd tell you if I didn't.

461
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:01,052
- I know that, so what is it?

462
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:03,888
- Al, I grew up in this town.

463
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:05,723
I've been dating college boys

464
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:07,475
since I was old enough
to be noticed by them.

465
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,435
- Well, that, I agree,
must have been horrible.

466
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:10,395
- It's no trick for a girl

467
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:12,230
to be busy in a college town.

468
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:15,233
And these weren't cheap little liars, Al.

469
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:16,567
They meant it, I guess.

470
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:20,613
But there's something
about being away to college

471
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:22,532
makes for deep and lasting love affairs,

472
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:24,617
which are forgotten the
minute graduation's over.

473
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,828
- Hm, yeah.

474
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:32,125
You know, you've had a real rough life

475
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:36,587
and I wish there was some way
I could make it up to you.

476
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,756
- Okay, but you asked me for the reason

477
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:40,675
I couldn't take you too seriously.

478
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:43,594
- And you haven't answered me yet.

479
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:45,972
Look, this isn't my
first trip away from home

480
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:48,182
and it's only technical that,

481
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:49,767
I'm one of the boola-boola boys at all.

482
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:51,185
- You're not all that old.

483
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:52,645
- No, but I'm all that experienced

484
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,105
that I know the difference

485
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:56,733
between a few early fumblings with a girl

486
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:58,776
and something that's nice and lasting

487
00:21:59,068 --> 00:21:59,777
that's happened to me.

488
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:02,196
It's time you begin realizing

489
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,032
that I know the difference.

490
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:07,785
- This summer, if anything,
has only made you more lovable

491
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:10,288
and willing to admit it.

492
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:13,791
- Would you care to dance?

493
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,419
- No, but it's part of my duties here.

494
00:22:19,464 --> 00:22:21,424
- Whatever will the other B-girls think!

495
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:24,177
- That you've finally gotten a live one.

496
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:36,439
- Want a light?

497
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:38,983
- Okay.

498
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:41,527
- I'm a stranger in town.

499
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,321
Can you direct me to your house?

500
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:47,241
- Did you lose the address?

501
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,160
- Why, I was wrestling cows all summer,

502
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:50,620
and my writing hand got all cramped up--

503
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:52,705
- Oh, I see, how are the cows out West?

504
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:55,833
- Oh, they're, oh, you mean the cows?

505
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:56,834
Well.

506
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:01,547
- Look, I guess I must have
been all crossed up last spring.

507
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,926
I thought you and I were a
big, hot, breathless item,

508
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:06,803
then not even a card this summer.

509
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:09,889
- Well, Jean, I meant to
call you, I really did--

510
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:12,016
- Oh, fine, now I feel much better.

511
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:17,146
- How could you possibly
feel any better, hm?

512
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:23,486
- Real cozy.

513
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:28,699
- Look, buddy, why don't
you go back to your table

514
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:30,701
before somebody eats up your minimum?

515
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:32,787
- She happens to belong with me, pal.

516
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,163
- Only in spirit, son.

517
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,376
- You get back inside.

518
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:47,802
I know all about you,
pal, a real war hero.

519
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,555
One of the fruit salad boys.

520
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:54,892
Well, how do you like your beatings, huh?

521
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:56,853
Standing up or on the ground?

522
00:23:57,145 --> 00:23:58,521
- Don't crowd me, Mac.

523
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:07,196
You'd better leave it lay, junior.

524
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:21,419
- Brick, Brick!

525
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:23,463
Get him out of here, fast!

526
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:25,006
- I'll kill that.

527
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:27,425
- Brick, Brick, Brick!

528
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:29,594
It's me, Al, Al.

529
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:55,161
Come on, Brick, I'll take you home.

530
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:56,162
Come on.

531
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:06,881
Here, Brick.

532
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:15,264
Listen to me, Brick.

533
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:19,852
You know, it might not be a bad idea

534
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:21,187
going back to the vets hospital to check--

535
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:22,188
- I'm not going back there, Al.

536
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,272
- Just a check--
- I'm not going back!

537
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:25,191
I don't want any part of that cage.

538
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:28,444
- They were only trying to help you.

539
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:29,362
- Treat you like an animal.

540
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:30,821
Like something under a rock.

541
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:33,241
All the time telling you you're psycho.

542
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:35,493
- A lot of guys went
through shock like you did.

543
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:37,703
- Look, Al, I'm okay, I'm okay!

544
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:39,747
- Sure, sure, you're okay.

545
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:40,706
You're in great shape.

546
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:42,166
But it still wouldn't
hurt to have a check-up.

547
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,418
- Look, lay off of me, will you?

548
00:25:45,545 --> 00:25:46,587
You want to get rid of me?

549
00:25:47,672 --> 00:25:48,256
What's the matter?

550
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:49,090
You tired of having me
hanging on your back?

551
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:50,424
Okay, I'll get out of
here, I'll get out now!

552
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:51,884
- You're not going anywhere.

553
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:53,803
- They told you to call, didn't they, huh?

554
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:55,930
Give us a call, Captain, in case 3742

555
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:57,223
starts going off his rocker again.

556
00:25:57,515 --> 00:25:59,100
- I'm not making any calls.

557
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:02,395
- That for sure?

558
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:03,771
- Sure.

559
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:32,049
You know, you really could
have hurt that kid at the club.

560
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:33,092
- I know!

561
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:41,726
- What do you think is going
to happen to you if you,

562
00:26:43,728 --> 00:26:44,729
be sensible, Brick.

563
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,481
Go over and have a talk with the doc.

564
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:55,239
- Look, Al, I'm a lot better now.

565
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:56,532
This isn't going to happen again.

566
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,534
I just had a couple of
drinks too many, that's all.

567
00:26:58,826 --> 00:26:59,827
- Sure, that's what you said up in

568
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:02,163
San Francisco last year
with that cab driver.

569
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:03,623
- Yeah, but, Al, these things take time.

570
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:05,708
That's all I need. Just a little time.

571
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:07,585
- Sure.

572
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:13,132
- If those doctors hear about tonight,

573
00:27:13,424 --> 00:27:15,468
it's going to sound a
lot worse than it was.

574
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,302
- They won't hear about it.

575
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:18,220
- You won't say anything, Al?

576
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:20,306
- No, I won't say anything, I promise.

577
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:31,859
Brick, you're gonna
have to watch yourself.

578
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:35,237
- I know.

579
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:36,864
It'll work out, it'll work out.

580
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:06,310
- Well, this is the last time

581
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:07,937
I'm going to double date with you.

582
00:28:08,229 --> 00:28:11,023
You know she danced like
7 miles of unpaved road?

583
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:12,650
Spiegy's got better taste than you have.

584
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:13,609
- Oh, stop.

585
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:15,361
- Oh boy, what's happening to me?

586
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:17,154
How could you trap me like this?

587
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:21,492
- What's the matter with Brick?

588
00:28:21,784 --> 00:28:23,786
- Nothing a good night's sleep won't cure.

589
00:28:25,246 --> 00:28:26,622
- Well, that's the trouble with liquor.

590
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:30,042
You take one drink and it
makes a new man out of you.

591
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:32,420
Then the new man has to have a drink, too.

592
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:34,130
Quote and unquote.

593
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:49,603
- You can tell me your troubles.

594
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:52,231
How's Brick?

595
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:53,566
- Brick?

596
00:28:53,858 --> 00:28:55,735
Oh, he's fine, fine.

597
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:56,736
Why?

598
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,822
- One of the men at the club
said he ought to be put away.

599
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:03,200
- The guy that said that ought
to be put away, Brick's okay.

600
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:04,243
- Like last night?

601
00:29:05,453 --> 00:29:06,787
- Well, he had one too many.

602
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:10,833
- Then how come you're so, so quiet today?

603
00:29:12,126 --> 00:29:14,920
- Well, since you brought
it up, I'll tell you.

604
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:17,089
It all started about the time I met you.

605
00:29:18,132 --> 00:29:20,176
- Others have complained
about that before.

606
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:21,469
What are the symptoms?

607
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,972
- Well, studying that
used to take me one hour,

608
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:26,474
now takes me half the night.

609
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:27,892
In the middle of a law lecture,

610
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:29,226
I suddenly find I'm repeating

611
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:31,020
the marriage ceremony to myself.

612
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,939
Now, would you say this is significant?

613
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:36,942
- No, frightening is the word I'd use.

614
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:37,777
- You know, I've been places

615
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:39,862
where if you didn't make
up your mind in a hurry,

616
00:29:40,154 --> 00:29:41,530
you never got a second chance.

617
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:46,869
- Honey, you're not in Korea anymore.

618
00:29:48,162 --> 00:29:50,456
Nobody's gonna drop a bomb on you now.

619
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:52,333
- I'd better do something.

620
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,251
- What do you want to do, Al?

621
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:56,337
- Get married.

622
00:29:58,214 --> 00:29:58,798
- Now?

623
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:00,508
- Yesterday would have been better.

624
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:04,470
- What's the big rush?

625
00:30:04,762 --> 00:30:06,222
What's the matter with
being sure of ourselves?

626
00:30:06,514 --> 00:30:09,266
- I'm so sure of myself now,
I'm nearly dead from it.

627
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:14,522
- I guess that's the
roadblock, you're not.

628
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:16,148
- I may look like the blonde bombshell

629
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,235
who's been everyplace, and
done everything, but I'm not.

630
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:23,322
And all these big emotions are wonderful.

631
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,991
But they just kind of scare me, too.

632
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:29,286
- Well, look, why don't
you just relax, huh?

633
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:30,913
- I'm like you, I can't.

634
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:35,334
I want to get married today
just as much as you do.

635
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:37,962
But then when I stop to think about it,

636
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:41,090
I get so scared, I just want to run.

637
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:57,940
- What's the good word?

638
00:30:58,232 --> 00:30:59,525
- There aren't any good words.

639
00:30:59,817 --> 00:31:02,319
They don't make good words
the way they used to.

640
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:03,529
- Don't just stand there, Spiegy.

641
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:04,572
Run around, do something!

642
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:06,115
I don't want your muscles to stiffen up.

643
00:31:06,407 --> 00:31:06,949
- Yes, sir!

644
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:09,410
- Tear on over and get
Cokes for everybody, Spiegy.

645
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:13,497
- I tell you, that boy's getting lazy.

646
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:14,832
Why, he had the audacity to ask me

647
00:31:15,124 --> 00:31:16,292
to brush my own teeth this morning.

648
00:31:16,584 --> 00:31:17,960
- They don't make freshmen
the way they used to.

649
00:31:18,252 --> 00:31:20,004
- No, they've even quit trying.

650
00:31:20,296 --> 00:31:20,838
- Hi, Brick!

651
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:21,839
- Hi, hi, hi.

652
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,092
- Are you coming

653
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:27,177
to our Halloween dance tonight, Brick?

654
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:28,429
- Probably not.

655
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:29,305
- It's
going to be one of the

656
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:31,015
best dances of the year.

657
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:35,686
- Sweetheart, let me tell you something.

658
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:37,605
I wonder if now is the time

659
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:39,773
when any of us should be dancing,

660
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:41,191
when we don't know if Little Orphan Annie

661
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:43,569
is ever going to find Daddy Warbucks.

662
00:31:43,861 --> 00:31:45,654
- She's just got to.

663
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:47,406
- I know, I know.

664
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:54,079
- Maybe one of your
own would taste better.

665
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:54,914
- No, it's not that.

666
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:56,749
I'm suffering from something.

667
00:31:57,041 --> 00:32:00,252
I think it's the
edges-off-of-everything blues.

668
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:02,546
- Maybe you should organize a panty raid.

669
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:04,632
- No, no, it goes deeper than that.

670
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:06,258
I don't want to get drunk.

671
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,134
I'm sick of being sober.

672
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,011
I've seen both movies in town.

673
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:11,680
- It's the mid-semester whim-whams.

674
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,224
What you need is a nice girl.

675
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:20,314
- Child, what I need has got
nothing to do with nice girls.

676
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:22,942
- I know what Brick
means, I've got it myself.

677
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:24,735
Bored with classes that have just begun

678
00:32:25,027 --> 00:32:26,987
and notes I haven't taken yet.

679
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,405
Bored with being in a place

680
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:30,950
that's run by thinkers and not doers.

681
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:33,077
I come from a family that does things.

682
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:34,119
- Well, they can afford to.

683
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:36,872
- A family that does things first.

684
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:39,291
That's what I need in
my life, a big first.

685
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:43,170
You guys ever hear of
a man named Schliemann?

686
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,339
- Sure, played first base for the Giants

687
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:48,175
and later invented a
plastic breakfast food.

688
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,761
- He dug up the ancient
city of Troy in Greece.

689
00:32:51,053 --> 00:32:53,430
- Hey, what a cat, to dig Troy!

690
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:55,307
- That was a first, get my point?

691
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:56,809
- Well, I couldn't hope to do that.

692
00:32:57,101 --> 00:32:57,685
- And that's what we've got to think of

693
00:32:57,977 --> 00:32:59,687
to pull ourselves out of the swamp.

694
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:01,105
To be first at something.

695
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:04,817
Like the guy who flew
under the London Bridge.

696
00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:07,277
Characters who stole the
Stone of Scone in England.

697
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:09,071
- Just like Plinehouser.

698
00:33:09,363 --> 00:33:10,447
- Who was Plinehouser?

699
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:11,281
- Well, just the first guy

700
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:12,992
to be called Plinehouser, that's all.

701
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:15,285
- He's right, though,
this boy's got a point.

702
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:16,704
Everybody's got a headache today.

703
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:18,747
We've living in the aspirin age.

704
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:22,292
- It's really
very simple, Mr. Cruikshank.

705
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:24,211
- Now wait a minute.
- Mind if I file these?

706
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:25,212
- Help yourself.

707
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:28,799
- You bet me $5 I can't do what?

708
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:30,217
- It's a very simple bet.

709
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,511
Now you're sitting right
here where I'm sitting.

710
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:33,595
Follow me?
- Yeah.

711
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:36,265
- I pour a glass of water
on the floor, right here.

712
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:37,099
- Yeah.

713
00:33:37,391 --> 00:33:38,225
- You got a knife in your hands.

714
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:39,018
- A knife?

715
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:40,519
- Now, I'll bet you five bucks

716
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:42,104
that I can dry up the water

717
00:33:42,396 --> 00:33:44,648
before you stab me on
the hands with the knife.

718
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:48,235
- All right, who's got a knife?

719
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:53,866
- Are these regular
issue for law students?

720
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:56,952
- I've been getting into a
lot of strange closets lately.

721
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:58,037
Dangerous moths.

722
00:33:59,455 --> 00:34:01,373
- Now, you sit right where I was sitting.

723
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:14,344
Now, remember, 5 bucks
if I dry up the water

724
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:15,971
before you stab my hands.

725
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:17,639
- Spiegy, are you sure?

726
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:19,183
I mean, the blood.

727
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:21,477
- I'm sure, now you ready?

728
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:22,811
- Okay.

729
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:26,315
- One, two, three.

730
00:34:30,194 --> 00:34:31,403
- They grow up fast these days.

731
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:32,529
- Pay me.

732
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:41,622
- I'll bet you $5 that you
never get the $5 I owe you.

733
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:43,499
And having won that bet, we're even,

734
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:45,459
so quit worrying about
money and get to work.

735
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:46,585
- Yes, sir.

736
00:34:51,632 --> 00:34:52,758
- Something you invented?

737
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:58,889
- Glad
to meet you, mister.

738
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:00,641
Hope I don't have to kill you.

739
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:03,352
- Special research.

740
00:35:03,644 --> 00:35:05,270
- What for, what's My Crime?

741
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:07,064
- Remember what that cop
said in Harold's Club

742
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:08,941
when we got involved in that hold-up?

743
00:35:09,233 --> 00:35:11,360
He said there's no way it could be done.

744
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:13,487
He should only know.

745
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:15,447
- You mean you've been thinking
about it all this time?

746
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:17,616
- I've worked out a plan
how to rob Harold's Club

747
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:19,618
of a million dollars, maybe more.

748
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:20,452
- Oh.

749
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:22,746
How much time you figure on
researching our penal system?

750
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:23,705
- When I say a plan,

751
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:26,291
I mean one where you'd
walk away free and clear.

752
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:31,088
- You know what bitsy brain's doing now?

753
00:35:32,256 --> 00:35:34,174
- Last year he planned
to drain Foster's Lake

754
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:35,843
and collect all the pennies
that had been thrown there

755
00:35:36,135 --> 00:35:37,761
for the last 130 years.

756
00:35:39,263 --> 00:35:40,889
He figured it would
amount to over $70,000.

757
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:43,517
- A man is never appreciated
in his own century.

758
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:45,060
- Yeah, well, maybe when
you get out of prison

759
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:46,311
in the next one, you'll be with people

760
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:48,147
that understand your language.

761
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:50,649
You really think you could
knock off Harold's Club?

762
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:52,317
A joint that's open 24 hours a day,

763
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:54,236
seven days a week, 52
weeks out of the year,

764
00:35:54,528 --> 00:35:56,029
with over 1,000 people in it every second.

765
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:57,114
- I do.

766
00:35:57,406 --> 00:35:58,866
- The main cash vault
is right in the middle

767
00:35:59,158 --> 00:36:00,242
of the floor of the gambling room.

768
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:01,451
It looks like the Rock of Gibraltar

769
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:03,328
and opens like the Panama Canal.

770
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,913
- It has two doors, both steel-barred,

771
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:06,707
and one doesn't open
until the other's closed.

772
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:07,916
- Oh, great, that's a cinch.

773
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:09,710
All you need is a hairpin
and a toy hammer, huh?

774
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:11,628
- I've got that all worked out.

775
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,172
The only thing left I've got to figure

776
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:15,382
is how to leave Reno without a trace.

777
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,176
This boy's got a little
Dillinger blood in him.

778
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:19,928
- This boy has the spirit
of adventure in his heart.

779
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,555
- You really think you could do it?

780
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:23,223
- Oh, I could do it all right.

781
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,100
The question is, would I do it?

782
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:28,187
Of course, I wouldn't
keep the money if I did.

783
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:30,272
- Now he's a communist, he hates money.

784
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:32,274
- He's a crazy, mixed-up rich kid.

785
00:36:32,566 --> 00:36:33,859
And they're the worst kind, you know.

786
00:36:34,151 --> 00:36:35,319
- Yeah.

787
00:36:35,611 --> 00:36:37,863
Okay, Mr. First, what's the gimmick?

788
00:36:38,155 --> 00:36:40,824
I wouldn't mind being first
with a million bucks myself.

789
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,828
- You
louse this deal, Jack,

790
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,664
I'll gut you and shoot my way out of here.

791
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:51,001
- It's all done with psychology.

792
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:55,339
A simple and basic
motivation, fear, gentlemen.

793
00:36:55,631 --> 00:36:58,508
In this case, worth one million dollars.

794
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,928
- Gee, a million bucks.

795
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:03,263
Well, I wouldn't be afraid.

796
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:05,390
I'd be petrified.

797
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:39,132
This must be the place where
they rehearsed Tobacco Road.

798
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:41,051
Now, why would he want a trailer?

799
00:37:41,343 --> 00:37:42,761
- Well, to transport his old money

800
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:44,304
to the scrap heap, perhaps.

801
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:45,514
- Or to take his old girlfriends in

802
00:37:45,806 --> 00:37:46,848
for a retread job, perhaps?

803
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,100
- I bought both the car and the trailer,

804
00:37:48,392 --> 00:37:50,102
and I did it without
leaving a single trace.

805
00:37:50,394 --> 00:37:51,103
- This is desirable?

806
00:37:51,395 --> 00:37:52,187
- Ah, I used a fictitious name

807
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:53,438
and bought them across the state line

808
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:54,815
from the smiling Dutchman.

809
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:57,276
- Who must be laughing
out loud after this deal.

810
00:37:57,567 --> 00:37:58,110
- You're sure you didn't steal it?

811
00:37:58,402 --> 00:37:59,903
- Does this look like I stole it?

812
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:01,905
- How can I think when I'm blinded?

813
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:03,573
- His folks must have
clipped a coupon last night,

814
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:04,574
or sold a state.

815
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:05,867
- Well, it was just a small one.

816
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,911
Rhode Island, wasn't it, Ronnie?

817
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:08,912
- Why, it's a perfect set-up.

818
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:10,914
One guy drives, the others
hide inside, out of sight,

819
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:12,874
and no one can trace it back.

820
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,752
- According to the law I've studied,

821
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:18,130
it's a misdemeanor to ride in a trailer

822
00:38:18,422 --> 00:38:19,923
when it is in motion.

823
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:22,259
- You think a couple of
misdemeanors is gonna bother Ronnie?

824
00:38:22,551 --> 00:38:24,261
He's only interested in felonies.

825
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:25,929
- Yeah, but you're still
going to have to stop

826
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:27,431
for gas, oil and water.

827
00:38:27,723 --> 00:38:29,349
- Everything you need,
you carry in the trailer.

828
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:31,768
Gasoline, drinking water, canned foods.

829
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,437
- Dynamite for blasting out of jail.

830
00:38:33,729 --> 00:38:35,188
- And Thanksgiving is
a perfect time for it.

831
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,398
It's Jamboree Week in Reno.

832
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:38,984
And everybody wears cowboy
outfits and false beards.

833
00:38:39,276 --> 00:38:41,278
It's just like a Western Mardi Gras.

834
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:44,531
- You, uh, you're talking
like this could be done.

835
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:45,657
I mean, actually.

836
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:47,784
- It can be done, Brick
and I mean actually.

837
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:48,618
- So what?

838
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:49,453
None of us are gonna do it.

839
00:38:49,745 --> 00:38:50,287
- Why not?

840
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:52,414
Call it a field experiment in psychology.

841
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:54,207
- It's not what
we call it that matters.

842
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:55,125
- If we don't keep the money,

843
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:56,752
we're not committing any actual crime.

844
00:38:57,044 --> 00:38:57,544
- Suppose they grab us

845
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:58,587
before we get a chance to show them

846
00:38:58,879 --> 00:38:59,671
we weren't going to keep the money.

847
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:00,547
- They won't, I tell you.

848
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:01,381
I've got everything worked out

849
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:02,382
and it's foolproof.

850
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:03,717
We leave the trailer in Reno.

851
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:04,551
We board a train

852
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:05,385
and we're out of town before

853
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:07,429
anybody knows we've even been there.

854
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:08,430
- Yeah.

855
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:10,724
What are you shutting up about?

856
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:12,517
- It all takes place in seven minutes.

857
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:13,894
At the first stop, we get on the phone

858
00:39:14,186 --> 00:39:15,812
and let them know where the money is.

859
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:16,730
- Well, you know me,

860
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:18,482
always the first one to
tear down a goalpost,

861
00:39:18,774 --> 00:39:20,484
or any other red-blooded college prank.

862
00:39:20,776 --> 00:39:22,903
- Please, don't talk about blood!

863
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:23,820
- What else will you need?

864
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:25,030
- A cart.

865
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:25,989
We'd have to build a cart,

866
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:27,532
just like the one we saw at Harold's Club.

867
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:28,533
- Yeah.

868
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:30,327
- And we'd need another guy.

869
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:31,161
- Why?

870
00:39:31,453 --> 00:39:33,955
- Well, the plan calls for
four guys to make it work.

871
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:36,625
Do you think Al would go for it?

872
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:39,669
- Not if he knew what he was doing.

873
00:39:40,754 --> 00:39:42,923
Last couple of days, I
promise you he hasn't.

874
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:46,510
Do you think it would work with Al,

875
00:39:46,802 --> 00:39:49,262
if he didn't know what was
up until the last minute?

876
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:50,263
- Hm-mm.

877
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,391
- You really need him?

878
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:57,312
It might be fun if we all did it together.

879
00:39:58,939 --> 00:39:59,689
- Clear out the attic, Mother,

880
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:01,942
I'm having in a few friends to hide.

881
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:03,527
- It's easier than swallowing goldfish.

882
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:05,320
- Well, who said I want
to do that, either?

883
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:06,696
- About Al.

884
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:07,531
- Yeah?

885
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:09,032
- I've got to have four guys.

886
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:10,534
- How about Spiegy?

887
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:12,911
- You got Al.

888
00:40:13,954 --> 00:40:15,580
- Spiegy, shew!

889
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:36,059
- The Ancient Mariner.

890
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:37,644
- Ah, very funny.

891
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:38,770
What are you doing here, Brick?

892
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:39,896
I thought you were packing.

893
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:41,314
- How's Kay doing?

894
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:42,274
- Oh, fine, fine.

895
00:40:42,566 --> 00:40:44,401
Took three encores tonight.

896
00:40:44,693 --> 00:40:47,529
And she'll be out of the
shower in five minutes.

897
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:49,114
- You're getting to be a
regular night-club Johnny,

898
00:40:49,406 --> 00:40:50,031
aren't you?

899
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:51,408
- Yeah, I like it.

900
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,035
- Listen, the guys insist you come along.

901
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:55,287
Vacation starts tomorrow.

902
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:56,455
We go to Reno a couple of days

903
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:58,290
and then up to Ronnie's ranch.

904
00:40:58,582 --> 00:41:00,041
- Why drive all that distance?

905
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:03,211
- Well, everybody gets their
own private monogrammed turkey.

906
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:04,921
Maybe we win a couple
of dollars at roulette.

907
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:08,049
- Hm, I can have more fun right here.

908
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:10,677
- You know, it might do you

909
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,846
and Kay some good not to see
each other for a week or so.

910
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:17,017
You know the old gag about
absence makes the something.

911
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:20,061
- Yeah, I know that old gag.

912
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:21,938
Brick, this year we're stuffing our turkey

913
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,316
with dressing rooms, not dressing.

914
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:37,996
- Who is it?

915
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:41,875
- Why?

916
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:44,669
- No reason, except
I'm just out of the shower.

917
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:48,798
- You know, I never told you,

918
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,426
but I used to have a job
in a ladies' Turkish bath.

919
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:53,011
- Hey, what about those Turkish women?

920
00:41:53,303 --> 00:41:53,845
Pretty cute?

921
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:56,306
- Yeah, but they all had Turkish men.

922
00:41:56,598 --> 00:41:57,933
- Oh, you do get the
bad breaks, don't you?

923
00:41:58,225 --> 00:42:00,477
- Hm-mm, you know, a soap opera is a fast,

924
00:42:00,769 --> 00:42:02,562
funny musical compared to my life.

925
00:42:06,483 --> 00:42:07,776
However, there are moments

926
00:42:08,068 --> 00:42:10,570
I wouldn't trade for mountains of uranium.

927
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:15,492
- You know, I've been doing
a lot of thinking about us.

928
00:42:15,784 --> 00:42:18,161
- Oh, you, too?

929
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:18,995
- You told me the boys invited you

930
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:20,288
to go along with them to Reno

931
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,415
over the Thanksgiving holidays.

932
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:24,292
- Yeah, Brick's outside
now trying to sign me on.

933
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:25,877
You know, why they should want me

934
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:28,171
with my sad face is
more than I can figure.

935
00:42:30,257 --> 00:42:31,466
- You know, I was thinking

936
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:33,885
that if you went along with them

937
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:34,970
and we didn't see each other

938
00:42:35,262 --> 00:42:36,721
until after you got back,

939
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:41,518
I just thought that it
would give us a week

940
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:43,061
to get away from each other

941
00:42:44,646 --> 00:42:46,898
and just kind of think things over.

942
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,191
- Sure.

943
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:53,905
- Don't get sore, Al.

944
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:54,739
It's just that

945
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:56,032
when we're together I can't--
- Look,

946
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:57,367
you don't have to explain anything to me.

947
00:42:57,659 --> 00:42:59,744
You can see or not see anybody you want.

948
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:00,662
- It's only a week, Al.

949
00:43:00,954 --> 00:43:02,497
- It's not the seven long
miserable days, baby.

950
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:04,749
It's the fact that you still
have to think up trick gimmicks

951
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:06,459
to find out whether
you're in love with me.

952
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:07,711
- It isn't that.

953
00:43:08,003 --> 00:43:08,587
I know I'm in love with you.
- Do you?

954
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:09,629
Well, then maybe when
we're talking about love

955
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:12,382
we're talking about two different things.

956
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:13,842
- Maybe we're not.

957
00:43:14,134 --> 00:43:15,260
In my book, it means consideration

958
00:43:15,552 --> 00:43:16,261
for the feelings of the person

959
00:43:16,553 --> 00:43:17,095
you're supposed to be in love with!

960
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:17,929
- Have you noticed
my feelings lately?

961
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:18,805
They're pretty well beat.

962
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:20,724
- You feel real sorry
for yourself, don't you?

963
00:43:21,016 --> 00:43:22,017
- No, I don't feel sorry for myself.

964
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:23,435
I feel sorry for you.

965
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:26,896
You just can't make up your mind, can you?

966
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:29,107
- Al.
- What?

967
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:34,821
- Let's forget what I said.

968
00:43:36,323 --> 00:43:37,490
Maybe it was a lousy idea at that.

969
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:39,117
- No, maybe it's a good idea.

970
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:40,327
Anyway, let's give it a try.

971
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:42,454
It can't get any worse,
as far as I'm concerned.

972
00:43:42,746 --> 00:43:45,206
- Look, we don't have to
decide anything this minute.

973
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:46,374
I'll give you a call later.

974
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:48,835
- No, don't, maybe,
maybe we can get together

975
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:50,712
after Thanksgiving if we still want to,

976
00:43:51,004 --> 00:43:52,631
and you can make up your mind.

977
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:53,798
- Al, please.

978
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:04,017
- Let's get out of here.

979
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:05,018
- Sure.

980
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:06,811
- When are you leaving for Reno?

981
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:07,937
- In the morning.

982
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:09,898
- Okay, the sooner, the better.

983
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:18,281
- Hey, Al.

984
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:19,157
- Yeah?
- There's a cream cheese

985
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:19,991
looking for you.

986
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:22,202
She's downstairs, said it's urgent.

987
00:44:22,494 --> 00:44:23,036
She wanted to come up,

988
00:44:23,328 --> 00:44:24,746
but I told her it was against the.

989
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:27,749
- The house rules.

990
00:44:30,502 --> 00:44:31,544
- Thanks, Larry.

991
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,719
- Would there be any room
in there for my things?

992
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,304
- I don't know.

993
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:42,722
It depends on where you're going.

994
00:44:44,683 --> 00:44:46,935
- I hear they marry
people in a hurry in Reno.

995
00:44:48,228 --> 00:44:50,271
I have a friend who's going there.

996
00:44:56,486 --> 00:44:57,153
If what you've been going through is

997
00:44:57,445 --> 00:44:59,989
anything like what I've
been going through,

998
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:02,367
then I'm marrying the
toughest guy in the world.

999
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:07,122
- You're absolutely sure now?

1000
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:10,291
- I tell you, I've been boiled in oil,

1001
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:11,751
and I know what I'm doing.

1002
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:21,469
- Well, I know I should
get discreetly out of here,

1003
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:23,012
but I'm going to stay and watch.

1004
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:23,847
- We're getting married.

1005
00:45:24,139 --> 00:45:25,140
- Mm-hm.

1006
00:45:25,432 --> 00:45:26,683
- Hey, I said we're getting married.

1007
00:45:26,975 --> 00:45:27,517
- Yeah, I heard you.

1008
00:45:27,809 --> 00:45:30,437
I was just wondering if I should
sing something appropriate.

1009
00:45:31,521 --> 00:45:33,064
- Easy, boy, easy.
- There, that'll ruin you

1010
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:34,649
for all other men.

1011
00:45:34,941 --> 00:45:36,234
Well, I think you two are
going to like marriage.

1012
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:37,527
I've heard it described as something like

1013
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:39,487
tennis played with 40-millimeter cannons.

1014
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:41,281
- No, that's before you get married.

1015
00:45:41,573 --> 00:45:42,449
- Oh, I see.

1016
00:45:42,741 --> 00:45:43,450
- Say, I wonder if Ronnie would mind

1017
00:45:43,742 --> 00:45:44,951
giving us a lift as far as Reno?

1018
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:46,995
We'll leave you fast enough after that.

1019
00:45:47,287 --> 00:45:47,996
- Well.

1020
00:45:48,288 --> 00:45:49,581
- Well, never mind, we'll catch a train.

1021
00:45:49,873 --> 00:45:51,040
Come on, I'll take you home.

1022
00:45:54,127 --> 00:45:55,044
- Hey, wait a minute.

1023
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:55,879
You're going to need money

1024
00:45:56,171 --> 00:45:57,046
like you never needed money before.

1025
00:45:57,338 --> 00:45:58,298
Like you never dreamed of.

1026
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:00,383
And this child is not going
to travel alone with you

1027
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:02,510
until you've done the right thing, by her.

1028
00:46:02,802 --> 00:46:05,054
Old Brick is gonna see that
he doesn't get away from you

1029
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:07,056
now that he's ruined you!

1030
00:46:07,348 --> 00:46:08,892
- Thank you, old Brick.

1031
00:46:09,184 --> 00:46:09,684
- Hey, won't it be great on a honeymoon

1032
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:11,686
with just the five of us?

1033
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:12,520
- We'll see you, Brick.

1034
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:14,063
- Good night.
- Good night.

sharp since Tokyo, buddy.

1045
00:47:19,504 --> 00:47:22,674

about the chance he's taking?

1046
00:47:22,966 --> 00:47:24,217
- Chance, what chance?

1047
00:47:24,509 --> 00:47:25,051
- You know they're going to

1048
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:26,845
throw the book at you if you're caught.

1049
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:28,555
- What are you talking about?

1050
00:47:28,847 --> 00:47:31,057
- Well, riding back here,
it's against the law.

1051
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:33,184
- Oh, well, we just won't tell the cops

1052
00:47:33,476 --> 00:47:34,894
what we're doing, that's all.

1053
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:36,896
- Okay by me, it's your funeral.

1054
00:47:37,939 --> 00:47:38,523
Hey, you hungry?

1055
00:47:38,815 --> 00:47:39,607
- Starved.

1056
00:47:39,899 --> 00:47:40,441
- What do you say we stop

1057
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:42,068
in the next town and get a bite to eat?

1058
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,736
- Oh, when we're so
completely self-sufficient?

1059
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:45,029
Everything we need is right here.

1060
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:47,490
Food, gas and oil, water, you name it.

1061
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:50,410
- Yeah, we figured on getting
you two to Reno non-stop.

1062
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:52,996
- Come on, Brick, let's eat.

1063
00:47:53,288 --> 00:47:53,997
- Right.

1064
00:47:55,999 --> 00:47:57,917
- Complete down to the red, rough hands.

1065
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:04,799
- Where'd you get the cart, Ronnie?

1066
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:07,677
I built it, electric torch,
book of instructions.

1067
00:48:08,845 --> 00:48:10,763
Tom Swift and His
Radioactive Uncle, you know.

1068
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:11,598
- I didn't know

1069
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:13,349
you could do anything like that, Ronnie.

1070
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:15,852
Not a bad job, either.

1071
00:48:17,562 --> 00:48:18,730
Pretty nice along the seams.

1072
00:48:19,022 --> 00:48:21,190
- Al, here are your sandwiches.

1073
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:25,570
It's something I designed for Dad's ranch.

1074
00:48:25,862 --> 00:48:27,447
- I've seen a cart like
that somewhere before.

1075
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:29,198
I can't remember where.

1076
00:48:30,283 --> 00:48:31,701
- I'll trade you.

1077
00:48:31,993 --> 00:48:32,660

Now, is this what you've been
yapping about for so long?

1096
00:50:17,682 --> 00:50:19,308
- Just about.

1097
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,852
- You know, I must've been batty

1098
00:50:21,144 --> 00:50:22,103
to be scared about us.

1099
00:50:23,146 --> 00:50:25,314
- Well, you were young.

1100
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:28,401
We'll change all that.

1101
00:50:28,693 --> 00:50:32,071
- I was young, happy,
successful at my work,

1102
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:33,948
and now you're taking me out of all this.

1103
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,324
- Well, sometimes a little misery

1104
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:37,201
and poverty is character building.

1105
00:50:38,453 --> 00:50:41,789
- That's what I want to
build first, character.

1106
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:46,377
- Don't miss a one of them, Roy.

1107
00:50:46,669 --> 00:50:48,755
We can't leave a single
print inside this trailer.

1108
00:50:49,047 --> 00:50:50,256
- What happens if we do?

1109
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:52,550
- Then this rig can be traced back to us.

1110
00:50:52,842 --> 00:50:53,384
- What happens if someone

1111
00:50:53,676 --> 00:50:54,844
in Harold's Club starts shooting?

1112
00:50:55,136 --> 00:50:55,720
You know, with guns?

1113
00:50:56,012 --> 00:50:57,388
- I told you, no guns.

1114
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,890
- Yeah, but you didn't tell them.

1115
00:50:59,182 --> 00:51:01,017
- This plan is absolutely foolproof.

1116
00:51:01,309 --> 00:51:02,769
- He's a genius, if he says it is, it is.

1117
00:51:03,061 --> 00:51:05,438
- You know, they charge
double fares for bodies.

1118
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:06,606
- What do you mean by that?

1119
00:51:06,898 --> 00:51:07,523
- Just that.

1120
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:10,526
A body has to have two
tickets on a train or plane.

1121
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:13,321
There's a regulation about it somewhere.

1122
00:51:13,613 --> 00:51:16,282
- There's an example of
real positive thinking.

1123
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:18,493
- Listen, let's get
serious a minute, Ronnie.

1124
00:51:18,785 --> 00:51:20,203
All of us within the next 24 hours

1125
00:51:20,495 --> 00:51:21,370
could be lying on a dirty floor

1126
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:22,914
surrounded by cigarette butts,

1127
00:51:23,206 --> 00:51:24,916
staring up at a ring of strange faces

1128
00:51:25,208 --> 00:51:26,626
with bullet holes in our heads.

1129
00:51:26,918 --> 00:51:28,920
- Just wipe the cards and relax.

1130
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:31,964
- I've just rubbed this queen of spades

1131
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:33,966
so hard I've turned her into a jack.

1132
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:36,260
- We'll pull off the road up ahead.

1133
00:51:36,552 --> 00:51:38,054
It's good and dark outside.

1134
00:51:38,346 --> 00:51:39,722
Brick, you bury all that stuff.

1135
00:51:40,014 --> 00:51:42,266
Break the glass jugs
and scatter the pieces.

1136
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:43,392
- When do these go on?

1137
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:46,145
- When we stop, I'll take care of that.

1138
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:48,272
Roy, your job is to keep Al and Kay busy

1139
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:49,941
while we handle everything here.

1140
00:51:50,233 --> 00:51:51,275
- Keep them busy?

1141
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:54,028
I never saw two busier
people in my whole life.

1142
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,571
They haven't stopped once!

1143
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:02,120
- What are your folks
going to say about this?

1144
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:03,621
- It's been the ambition
of the whole family

1145
00:52:03,913 --> 00:52:07,250
to get somebody in good-looking
enough to answer the door.

1146
00:52:08,209 --> 00:52:10,628
- And what do the others do
while I'm answering the door?

1147
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,506
- Oh, they peek out
from behind the curtain

1148
00:52:13,798 --> 00:52:15,007
and look at you.

1149
00:52:17,385 --> 00:52:20,012
Hey, you trying for some
insurance money or something?

1150
00:52:21,681 --> 00:52:24,267
- I just lost all my shame for a minute.

1151
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:27,103
- Well, don't go looking for it.

1152
00:52:29,105 --> 00:52:31,649
You know, you're a nut, but I love you.

1153
00:53:02,471 --> 00:53:03,389
- Harold's Club!

1154
00:53:05,725 --> 00:53:07,476
Sure, that's what it looks like.

1155
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:09,395
- You're right.

1156
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:11,480
It looks like a dead ringer, doesn't it?

1157
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:13,649
- Glad
to meet you, mister.

1158
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:15,776
Hope I don't have to kill you.

1159
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:17,111
You louse this deal, Jack,

1160
00:53:17,403 --> 00:53:19,864
I'll gut you and shoot my way out of here.

1161
00:53:20,156 --> 00:53:20,781
- What's the pitch?

1162
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:22,366
- Brilliant, isn't it?

1163
00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:23,409
Now watch!

1164
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:28,456
- Yeah,
Jack, you getting this?

1165
00:53:28,748 --> 00:53:29,665
Get going!

1166
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:31,542
- What is it?

1167
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:32,376
- I don't know.

1168
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:34,086
- It's the greatest hoax of the century.

1169
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:35,838
As nefarious as Fu Manchu

1170
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:37,924
and as practical as a zipper.

1171
00:53:38,216 --> 00:53:39,717
It's a way to hold up
Harold's Club in Reno

1172
00:53:40,009 --> 00:53:42,220
and get away with it, a perfect crime.

1173
00:53:44,096 --> 00:53:46,140
- Did you know about this, Brick?

1174
00:53:46,432 --> 00:53:48,517
- Yeah, sure, I knew about it.

1175
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:50,770
- Yeah, you set him up for it, huh?

1176
00:53:51,062 --> 00:53:52,772
- No, it's his own idea, not mine.

1177
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:56,651
- Well, there's no harm done yet.

1178
00:53:56,943 --> 00:53:57,777
At least you haven't broken any laws

1179
00:53:58,069 --> 00:53:58,653
as far as I can see,

1180
00:53:58,945 --> 00:54:00,363
but you're trying hard for a cell block

1181
00:54:00,655 --> 00:54:01,948
and your varsity number.

1182
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,699
- Ronnie, how could you
dream up such a thing?

1183
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:05,326
- I don't know what everyone's
getting so excited about.

1184
00:54:05,618 --> 00:54:06,827
I've just come up with the greatest idea

1185
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:08,204
since the bikini bathing suit

1186
00:54:08,496 --> 00:54:09,622
and you treat me like a hardened criminal.

1187
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:10,456
- All right.

1188
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:12,083
Let's pull this rig over
to the side of the road.

1189
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:13,209
- Okay, Al.

1190
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:19,090
- All right, honey.

1191
00:54:19,382 --> 00:54:21,634
You stay here in the
trailer with Ronnie there.

1192
00:54:40,653 --> 00:54:42,154
How could you let these kids fool around

1193
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:43,739
with anything this stupid, Brick?

1194
00:54:44,031 --> 00:54:44,657
- Oh, you know how Roy is,

1195
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:47,285
he'll go along with anything for laughs.

1196
00:54:47,576 --> 00:54:50,162
But Ronnie's gone to a lot
of trouble and expense.

1197
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:53,207
He's worked out a plan, great plan.

1198
00:54:53,499 --> 00:54:54,959
He really could rob
Harold's Club, you know?

1199
00:54:55,251 --> 00:54:56,002
- Yeah, I know, he could do anything.

1200
00:54:56,294 --> 00:54:57,378
But how about you?

1201
00:54:57,670 --> 00:54:58,212
- Me?

1202
00:54:58,504 --> 00:54:59,046
- Yeah, you.

1203
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:00,047
- I'm dead serious.

1204
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:01,924
- Come on, let's quit horsing each other.

1205
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:03,884
- Don't talk down to me, Al.

1206
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:05,594
I don't feel a fit coming on or anything.

1207
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:06,846
I'm as cool as a trench knife.

1208
00:55:07,138 --> 00:55:08,014
- I'm not talking down to you.

1209
00:55:08,306 --> 00:55:10,057
Just tell me about it.

1210
00:55:10,349 --> 00:55:12,393
- All right, any guy who
wants to lead himself

1211
00:55:12,685 --> 00:55:14,061
a quiet, peaceful, uneventful life

1212
00:55:14,353 --> 00:55:15,354
picked the wrong time to get born.

1213
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:17,606
- Sure, sure, you had it tough, so did I.

1214
00:55:17,898 --> 00:55:19,984
But we made it back, that evens things up.

1215
00:55:20,276 --> 00:55:21,485
- No, it doesn't.

1216
00:55:21,777 --> 00:55:23,195
I did a lot of brain-beating
in that hospital.

1217
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:25,656
I got it figured out,
I figured it this way.

1218
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:28,367
A guy's got to have a little
money to call his own.

1219
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:29,660
Every time I thought I
could make ends meet,

1220
00:55:29,952 --> 00:55:31,203
some joker came along
and moved the ends out.

1221
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:32,163
Well, no more.

1222
00:55:32,455 --> 00:55:33,414
I'm gonna do anything to get what I want.

1223
00:55:33,706 --> 00:55:34,540
- Keep talking, keep talking.

1224
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:36,417
- I'm not going to graduate
this year or any year!

1225
00:55:36,709 --> 00:55:37,376
You know it, and I know it.

1226
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:38,252
- Sure you'll graduate.

1227
00:55:38,544 --> 00:55:39,378
We'll help pull you through.

1228
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:41,964
- No, you guys had me hanging
around your neck long enough.

1229
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:43,466
I wasn't cut out for law.

1230
00:55:44,425 --> 00:55:45,009
- Well, you're not cut out

1231
00:55:45,301 --> 00:55:46,469
for 50 years in prison, either.

1232
00:55:46,761 --> 00:55:48,262
- Look, I've already had my lost years.

1233
00:55:48,554 --> 00:55:50,097
You realize there are guys our age

1234
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:51,098
that are in practice already?

1235
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:52,266
- You're not thinking straight, Brick.

1236
00:55:52,558 --> 00:55:53,809
You better get yourself
back to that hospital fast.

1237
00:55:54,101 --> 00:55:56,187
- How much money you got in
your pocket, right now, huh?

1238
00:55:56,479 --> 00:55:57,021
How much you think you're gonna have

1239
00:55:57,313 --> 00:55:58,814
a year after you get out of school?

1240
00:55:59,106 --> 00:55:59,940
10, 20, 50 bucks?

1241
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:01,359
Ronnie's cooked up a sure thing.

1242
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:02,234
- You're both wrong!

1243
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:03,319
- We can be in and out of that club

1244
00:56:03,611 --> 00:56:05,488
in six minutes tonight,
Al, with a fortune.

1245
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:08,491
Tonight, Al, tonight you can
have 50,000 bucks, maybe.

1246
00:56:08,783 --> 00:56:09,325
You and Kay could live

1247
00:56:09,617 --> 00:56:10,159
high on the hog on that.
- I hear words

1248
00:56:10,451 --> 00:56:11,619
and they don't make sense.

1249
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:13,996
- We're counting on you.

1250
00:56:15,164 --> 00:56:16,040
- Counting on me?

1251
00:56:16,332 --> 00:56:17,708
- Sure, I figured it right down the line.

1252
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,418
Just like old times, Al.

1253
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,879
- Look, Brick, you saved my life once.

1254
00:56:22,171 --> 00:56:23,964
I'm grateful to you for that.

1255
00:56:24,256 --> 00:56:25,800
I'm going to help you.

1256
00:56:26,092 --> 00:56:27,593
We're going over to that
trailer, get that cart out

1257
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:29,637
and shove it over right down there.

1258
00:56:29,929 --> 00:56:30,679
Then we're going in to Reno

1259
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:32,890
and forget we ever had this conversation.

1260
00:56:34,642 --> 00:56:35,226
- Al.

1261
00:56:35,518 --> 00:56:36,227
- Yeah?

1262
00:56:37,478 --> 00:56:39,230
- You know, when you first
decided to bring Kay along,

1263
00:56:39,522 --> 00:56:41,190
it kind of worried me.

1264
00:56:41,482 --> 00:56:43,234
Now I can see how it's going to help.

1265
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:47,196
- You leave Kay out of this, Brick.

1266
00:56:47,488 --> 00:56:48,197
- Know why?

1267
00:56:49,448 --> 00:56:51,033
I got a part in the hold-up for her, too.

1268
00:56:51,325 --> 00:56:52,243
She's going to drive the car.

1269
00:56:54,829 --> 00:56:55,538
Ooh.

1270
00:56:57,915 --> 00:57:01,043
Hey, only got one punch for me, old buddy?

1271
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:02,670
- Don't push me, Brick.

1272
00:57:05,881 --> 00:57:08,342
You involve Kay in anything,
I'm going to kill you.

1273
00:57:10,511 --> 00:57:11,679
- Hey, that'd boost your legal career

1274
00:57:11,971 --> 00:57:13,347
real good, wouldn't it?

1275
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:14,557
Every law firm in the country would

1276
00:57:14,849 --> 00:57:16,225
want you for a junior partner.

1277
00:57:16,517 --> 00:57:17,685
- You're really sick.

1278
00:57:21,397 --> 00:57:22,022
Ronnie, go in that trailer

1279
00:57:22,314 --> 00:57:23,858
and bring that cart out here!

1280
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:24,859
- Al!

1281
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:29,155
- No guns, Brick, the deal was no guns.

1282
00:57:29,447 --> 00:57:29,989
- Now this is the way it works.

1283
00:57:30,281 --> 00:57:32,324
You three stay inside the trailer.

1284
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:34,118
Give me the trailer key, Ronnie.

1285
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:36,370
Come on, toss it.

1286
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,464
- Okay, you'll stay in deep
freeze till we get to Reno.

1287
00:57:46,755 --> 00:57:47,882
My old buddy here is gonna drive.

1288
00:57:48,174 --> 00:57:49,008
He has to rehearse his part,

1289
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,634
so he'll know what he's doing
when we get to Harold's Club.

1290
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:52,094
- You won't get
away with this, Brick.

1291
00:57:52,386 --> 00:57:53,846
Gun or no gun.

1292
00:57:54,138 --> 00:57:57,641
- Yes, I will, you want to know why?

1293
00:57:59,059 --> 00:58:00,769
'Cause your only chance of
getting out of this thing alive

1294
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:03,147
is to pull it off and get away clean.

1295
00:58:03,439 --> 00:58:04,148
- You're worse off than I thought.

1296
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,317
You ought to be back in that psycho ward.

1297
00:58:06,609 --> 00:58:07,776
- Psycho ward!

1298
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:08,611
- Yeah, that's right.

1299
00:58:08,903 --> 00:58:09,820
I should've told you guys before.

1300
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:11,572
- Shut up!
- That's where he--

1301
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:15,034
- Look at the evidence, Counselor.

1302
00:58:15,326 --> 00:58:17,661
Who bought the trailer and
the car you're riding in?

1303
00:58:17,953 --> 00:58:18,913
Ronnie.

1304
00:58:19,205 --> 00:58:20,748
Used a phony name and address.

1305
00:58:22,124 --> 00:58:25,127
And the license plates don't
go with this rig, either.

1306
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:27,129
Roy bought the groceries.

1307
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:28,756
He helped Ronnie to build the cart, too.

1308
00:58:29,048 --> 00:58:31,217
And that's Ronnie's voice you
heard on the tape recorder.

1309
00:58:31,509 --> 00:58:32,218
- Is that right?

1310
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:38,557
- You and Kay just came
along for the ride,

1311
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:41,268
but who's gonna believe it
was just to get married?

1312
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,895
You're part of a gang, Al.

1313
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:45,439
- He hasn't done anything.

1314
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:47,483
- The police aren't going to believe that.

1315
00:58:47,775 --> 00:58:48,817
- I'll take my chances.

1316
00:58:50,402 --> 00:58:51,612
- Maybe you don't read me.

1317
00:58:53,489 --> 00:58:54,073
If you guys don't back me up,

1318
00:58:54,365 --> 00:58:56,450
I'm going to rob Harold's
Club all by myself.

1319
00:58:57,493 --> 00:58:59,453
- You couldn't, Brick, not by yourself.

1320
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,289
- Well, then I'll say it again slowly,

1321
00:59:02,581 --> 00:59:03,832
so you'll understand.

1322
00:59:04,124 --> 00:59:08,420
I am going to rob Harold's
Club with or without you guys.

1323
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:11,674
And I'm going to use the gimmick
that you figured, Ronnie.

1324
00:59:11,966 --> 00:59:14,301
- They'll follow you
around like Lady Godiva.

1325
00:59:14,593 --> 00:59:16,428
- Well, you'd better pray I make it.

1326
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:17,263
'Cause if I get caught,

1327
00:59:17,555 --> 00:59:19,223
I'm going to drag you all in with me.

1328
00:59:20,766 --> 00:59:23,060
- Go on, get in
the back like he says.

1329
00:59:23,352 --> 00:59:24,979
- Now you're thinking straight, Al.

1330
00:59:27,314 --> 00:59:29,233
Oh, I want that cart moved up
in the back seat of the car

1331
00:59:29,525 --> 00:59:30,067
where I can watch it,

1332
00:59:30,359 --> 00:59:32,903
and cover it up with a blanket.

1333
00:59:33,195 --> 00:59:33,988
Come on, move!

1334
00:59:43,831 --> 00:59:46,875
And then you walk up to
the guy with the cart, see?

1335
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:50,337
And you say, I guess
you don't remember me.

1336
00:59:50,629 --> 00:59:51,589
Mr. Gunderson introduced us,

1337
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:53,215
but that was a long time ago.

1338
00:59:56,468 --> 00:59:57,970
Oh, look, Al.

1339
00:59:58,971 --> 00:59:59,972
You play this through with me,

1340
01:00:00,264 --> 01:00:02,099
you're not going to get in any trouble.

1341
01:00:03,225 --> 01:00:04,727
You were forced into a crime.

1342
01:00:05,019 --> 01:00:06,937
Now, even I can defend you on that.

1343
01:00:08,439 --> 01:00:09,023
- I should've sent you
back to that hospital

1344
01:00:09,315 --> 01:00:11,734
the night you clobbered
that kid at the club.

1345
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:14,320
- I'm not going back there, Al.

1346
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:16,113
I wouldn't have gone back there then

1347
01:00:16,405 --> 01:00:18,282
and I'm not going back now, either.

1348
01:00:20,868 --> 01:00:23,120
I'll do anything to keep
from going back there, Al.

1349
01:00:24,496 --> 01:00:25,581
Anything, you get that?

1350
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:29,335
- This is the best way
I know to get there.

1351
01:00:29,627 --> 01:00:30,502
- After I get that money,

1352
01:00:30,794 --> 01:00:33,881
I'm going to put a million miles
between me and the doctors.

1353
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:38,552
I can't live with that place
hanging over my head, Al.

1354
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:39,928
You think I like holding a gun on you?

1355
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:41,263
You think I like that?

1356
01:00:42,348 --> 01:00:43,682
You're the only guy ever
meant anything to me.

1357
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:44,725
But I'll cut you down, Al.

1358
01:00:45,017 --> 01:00:46,935
Even you, I'll cut you down
if you try to stop me, see?

1359
01:00:47,227 --> 01:00:48,687
- You've made that point enough.

1360
01:00:50,856 --> 01:00:52,232
- You think I'm crummy, don't you?

1361
01:00:53,942 --> 01:00:54,735
- No, I don't think you're crummy.

1362
01:00:55,027 --> 01:00:55,986
I know you're sick.

1363
01:00:57,946 --> 01:00:59,740
- Not sick enough to let you stop me.

1364
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:03,369
- I'm not going to stop you, Brick.

1365
01:01:04,453 --> 01:01:05,037
I'm gonna help you,

1366
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:06,330
because I don't want a
lot of innocent people

1367
01:01:06,622 --> 01:01:07,164
to get messed up.

1368
01:01:07,456 --> 01:01:08,832
You kill anyone, I'd feel responsible.

1369
01:01:09,124 --> 01:01:10,042
- Al, Al, I--

1370
01:01:10,334 --> 01:01:11,335
- Shut up, shut up!

1371
01:01:14,129 --> 01:01:15,547
I'm liable to get sick myself.

1372
01:01:50,541 --> 01:01:53,085
- Kay, take this.

1373
01:01:55,754 --> 01:01:56,672
- Why?

1374
01:01:56,964 --> 01:01:59,007
- In 65 seconds, Brick will stop.

1375
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:01,802
He'll unhitch the trailer and abandon it.

1376
01:02:02,094 --> 01:02:04,430
30 seconds later, we'll
walk into Harold's Club.

1377
01:02:04,722 --> 01:02:06,974
Exactly six minutes later, we'll come out.

1378
01:02:07,266 --> 01:02:09,393
An eastbound train
leaves one minute later.

1379
01:02:09,685 --> 01:02:10,561
- Ronnie figures we can walk from the club

1380
01:02:10,853 --> 01:02:12,312
to the station in 15 seconds.

1381
01:02:12,604 --> 01:02:14,523
- We'll board
her just as she rolls out.

1382
01:02:17,276 --> 01:02:18,736
- Why are you telling me this?

1383
01:02:19,027 --> 01:02:20,195
- I know how Brick thinks.

1384
01:02:21,363 --> 01:02:23,741
My job is to drop the
cart at the alley entrance

1385
01:02:24,032 --> 01:02:25,868
three minutes and 15
seconds after Al, Brick

1386
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,578
and Roy enter the club.

1387
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:29,705
Then I park the car in Harold's garage.

1388
01:02:29,997 --> 01:02:31,957
No one will notice it
there for a day or two.

1389
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:32,791
- You don't think Brick's going to let you

1390
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:34,710
out of his sight now, do you?

1391
01:02:35,002 --> 01:02:37,796
- No, but he will trust Kay.

1392
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:38,797
The minute he turns his head,

1393
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:41,049
I'm going to yell for the
first policeman I see.

1394
01:02:42,634 --> 01:02:44,303
- Not if you want Al alive.

1395
01:02:44,595 --> 01:02:46,054
- Brick would kill him for sure.

1396
01:02:50,058 --> 01:02:50,809
- Take this.

1397
01:02:52,311 --> 01:02:55,022
You have six minutes to
deliver the cart, park the car

1398
01:02:55,314 --> 01:02:57,107
and buy three tickets at the depot.

1399
01:02:57,399 --> 01:02:58,150
- Three tickets?

1400
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:01,195
- Brick and I won't be going back.

1401
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:04,031
- Now, don't talk like that, Ronnie.

1402
01:03:04,323 --> 01:03:06,950
Listen, maybe Kay is right,
maybe she could get the cops

1403
01:03:07,242 --> 01:03:08,118
and they could surround the place.

1404
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:09,620
- No, it's too late, Roy.

1405
01:03:09,912 --> 01:03:11,288
And they couldn't get Al clear of Brick.

1406
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:14,583
Cross Brick now and he'd
turn into a shooting maniac.

1407
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:16,627
He'd mow us down, and that's not all.

1408
01:03:16,919 --> 01:03:20,422
He'd kill a lot of innocent
people before they stopped him.

1409
01:03:20,714 --> 01:03:21,256
No, we've got to wait

1410
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:24,134
and let the professionals
catch him, after the hold-up.

1411
01:03:25,719 --> 01:03:27,387
It'll all be over in seven minutes.

1412
01:03:32,267 --> 01:03:34,019
It wasn't just a stunt, Roy.

1413
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:35,604
I wanted to see it work.

1414
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:38,482
And I want to see it work right now.

1415
01:03:39,566 --> 01:03:40,567
I don't mean for the money or anything,

1416
01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:43,654
but just to know I was able to do it.

1417
01:04:12,933 --> 01:04:17,187
- All right, bring out the cowboy outfits.

1418
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:21,441
Unhitch it.

1419
01:04:29,324 --> 01:04:31,034
Come on, start putting that stuff on.

1420
01:04:44,172 --> 01:04:46,008
All right, 25 seconds.

1421
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:47,759
I'm going to say this once, Kay.

1422
01:04:49,303 --> 01:04:50,387
Ronnie's supposed to deliver the cart

1423
01:04:50,679 --> 01:04:51,722
to the back entrance of Harold's Club

1424
01:04:52,014 --> 01:04:54,558
three minutes and 15
seconds after we enter.

1425
01:04:54,850 --> 01:04:57,769
Then he's supposed to park
the car in Harold's garage.

1426
01:04:58,061 --> 01:04:59,479
Now, this is a change of plans.

1427
01:05:00,731 --> 01:05:03,317
Ronnie's going to stay
with me and you do his job.

1428
01:05:03,609 --> 01:05:05,360
Drive the car, follow us.

1429
01:05:05,652 --> 01:05:08,113
I'll point out the spot
for you to leave the cart.

1430
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:10,574
The garage is across the
tracks from the club.

1431
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:13,201
And if the cart isn't there three minutes

1432
01:05:13,493 --> 01:05:16,538
and 15 seconds after we
enter, on the button,

1433
01:05:17,998 --> 01:05:18,832
I'm gonna kill Al.

1434
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:22,544
- I thought I told you
to leave her out of this.

1435
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:25,672
- You put your beards on.

1436
01:05:29,718 --> 01:05:30,552
Okay, time.

1437
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:34,556
Make up your mind, Kay, we're rolling.

1438
01:05:34,848 --> 01:05:36,558
Six minutes after we get into
Harold's Club, we'll be out.

1439
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:38,810
You'll see a train, get on it.

1440
01:05:39,102 --> 01:05:41,438
We'll enter different
cars and meet you later.

1441
01:05:41,730 --> 01:05:43,857
Ronnie's going to buy
the tickets on the train.

1442
01:05:48,195 --> 01:05:49,404
All right, Al, you decide.

1443
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:54,576
- Al, he's insane, do what he says!

1444
01:06:35,784 --> 01:06:36,743
- Let's move.

1445
01:06:40,706 --> 01:06:41,999
- On
the line, shoot it new.

1446
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:43,500
First to pass.

1447
01:06:43,792 --> 01:06:44,668
Here we go now.

1448
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:45,794
Come out with a winner.

1449
01:06:46,086 --> 01:06:47,295
You're next, eh.

1450
01:06:49,047 --> 01:06:51,425
Stand behind the line now.

1451
01:06:51,717 --> 01:06:52,426
Get back.

1452
01:06:57,347 --> 01:06:59,891
9:40 tonight, hanging on, hanging on.

1453
01:07:04,604 --> 01:07:05,814
Five and four now, sir.

1454
01:07:06,106 --> 01:07:06,898
- Good night.

1455
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:08,025
- Hi!

1456
01:07:08,316 --> 01:07:08,859
- Oh, hi!

1457
01:07:09,151 --> 01:07:11,445
- I guess you don't remember me.

1458
01:07:11,737 --> 01:07:12,988
Mr. Gunderson introduced us.

1459
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:15,073
- Well, you meet an awful lot of people.

1460
01:07:15,365 --> 01:07:15,907
- Sure, sure. I know,

1461
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:17,826
but I wanted to talk
to you, it's important.

1462
01:07:18,118 --> 01:07:20,078
If you could spare a second.

1463
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:21,079
- Oh?

1464
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:23,123
- Don't turn your head too quickly,

1465
01:07:23,415 --> 01:07:25,292
but if you look over your right shoulder,

1466
01:07:25,584 --> 01:07:26,418
you'll see a man.

1467
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:33,091
- What about him?

1468
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:34,259
- Well, that man's my partner.

1469
01:07:34,551 --> 01:07:36,219
He's got a gun pointed at your back.

1470
01:07:37,888 --> 01:07:40,807
You make the wrong move in the
next second, he'll kill you.

1471
01:07:41,099 --> 01:07:42,309
You getting it?

1472
01:07:42,601 --> 01:07:43,143
- Same good thing.

1473
01:07:43,435 --> 01:07:44,352
- Yeah, I hear you.

1474
01:07:44,644 --> 01:07:45,687
- No, don't look up there, look at me.

1475
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:51,443
- Seven winner, main line.

1476
01:07:51,735 --> 01:07:53,528
- I know they're watching us up there.

1477
01:07:54,863 --> 01:07:57,074
Right about now you'd
better start smiling.

1478
01:07:58,366 --> 01:07:59,951
Look at me and smile.

1479
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:03,455
This is a friendly conversation,
in case anybody's watching.

1480
01:08:03,747 --> 01:08:04,456
- Smile.

1481
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:07,584
- You can do better than that.

1482
01:08:07,876 --> 01:08:10,962
- Same Shooter.

1483
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:12,130
- All right.

1484
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:14,758
- What are we going to do now?

1485
01:08:15,801 --> 01:08:16,635
- Well, you're gonna push your cart

1486
01:08:16,927 --> 01:08:18,887
down to the blackjack table
at the head of the stairs

1487
01:08:19,179 --> 01:08:20,639
right next to the dealer

1488
01:08:20,931 --> 01:08:23,183
and ask her to keep an eye on it for you.

1489
01:08:23,475 --> 01:08:25,227
- But she'll think that's
funny if I do that.

1490
01:08:25,519 --> 01:08:26,728
Oh, she'll think it's funny,
but she'll do it anyway,

1491
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:28,230
because you asked her to.

1492
01:08:28,522 --> 01:08:29,689
And while we're walking down there,

1493
01:08:29,981 --> 01:08:31,817
you keep looking at us and smiling.

1494
01:08:34,277 --> 01:08:35,028
- Get going.

1495
01:08:49,626 --> 01:08:51,128
- Keep an eye on this for me.

1496
01:08:52,129 --> 01:08:52,879
- Okay.

1497
01:08:58,093 --> 01:08:59,219
- Got enough, Jesse?

1498
01:08:59,511 --> 01:09:00,929
- That's all yours.

1499
01:09:01,221 --> 01:09:02,806
- Wow.
- Next shooter.

1500
01:09:04,432 --> 01:09:05,016
- Coming
out on the line here.

1501
01:09:05,308 --> 01:09:05,851
- Don't look at the ceiling.

1502
01:09:06,143 --> 01:09:07,519
Just go out there to the alley.

1503
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:11,148
Smile, keep smiling.

1504
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:19,698
- Uh, sorry, we're working in here.

1505
01:09:19,990 --> 01:09:20,782
- But we--
- You'll have to use

1506
01:09:21,074 --> 01:09:22,075
the Virginia Street entrance.

1507
01:09:22,367 --> 01:09:22,909
- But we gamble
- That's the only

1508
01:09:23,201 --> 01:09:24,452
- there every day.
- entrance that's open.

1509
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:34,254
- Give him that cigarette.

1510
01:09:34,546 --> 01:09:35,839
- You yell for help and we'll run.

1511
01:09:36,131 --> 01:09:37,841
You'll save your boss a little money,

1512
01:09:38,758 --> 01:09:41,011
but just before we run,
I'm going to kill you.

1513
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:56,359
That's right, that's a duplicate.

1514
01:09:57,277 --> 01:09:58,361
You're gonna push that
into the money room,

1515
01:09:58,653 --> 01:10:00,197
just like it's your regular cart.

1516
01:10:02,324 --> 01:10:03,533
Stuff the bills in there.

1517
01:10:03,825 --> 01:10:06,369
No silver, just bills.

1518
01:10:06,661 --> 01:10:08,121
All you say is the boss wanted the money.

1519
01:10:08,413 --> 01:10:10,290
He sent you to get it,
and he wants it quick.

1520
01:10:10,582 --> 01:10:12,292
Anybody wants to know why, you don't know

1521
01:10:12,584 --> 01:10:14,377
and you don't care.

1522
01:10:14,669 --> 01:10:16,296
Then you tie the sack up,
put it on top of the cart

1523
01:10:16,588 --> 01:10:18,173
and push it right back here.

1524
01:10:18,465 --> 01:10:19,257
You got that?

1525
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:20,717
- Sure.

1526
01:10:21,009 --> 01:10:22,886
- I guess you're wondering
why you ought to do this,

1527
01:10:23,178 --> 01:10:24,763
once you're inside, huh?

1528
01:10:26,014 --> 01:10:27,515
- Well, it had crossed my mind.

1529
01:10:28,725 --> 01:10:30,477
- Meet the other member of our group.

1530
01:10:33,188 --> 01:10:34,940
- Glad
to meet you, mister.

1531
01:10:35,232 --> 01:10:37,150
Hope I don't have to kill you.

1532
01:10:37,442 --> 01:10:39,778
- See, you're going to have
company in the cash room,

1533
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:42,197
our little friend in the cart.

1534
01:10:43,365 --> 01:10:43,949
You're going to wheel
him in there with you

1535
01:10:44,241 --> 01:10:45,450
and then out again.

1536
01:10:47,327 --> 01:10:48,078
Wonder why?

1537
01:10:49,496 --> 01:10:50,497
Tell him why, Charlie.

1538
01:10:51,748 --> 01:10:54,751
- Guy in there's 5 feet tall,
no bigger than most jockeys.

1539
01:10:55,043 --> 01:10:57,629
He's served time, I won't say where.

1540
01:10:57,921 --> 01:10:59,881
He's out, because he escaped.

1541
01:11:00,173 --> 01:11:01,841
He says he'll never serve time again.

1542
01:11:02,133 --> 01:11:03,301
- You
louse this deal, Jack,

1543
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:05,845
I'll gut you and shoot my way out of here.

1544
01:11:06,137 --> 01:11:06,680
- See, he's going to watch you

1545
01:11:06,972 --> 01:11:08,640
all the time through these louvers.

1546
01:11:08,932 --> 01:11:09,808
The top isn't fastened down.

1547
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:13,228
All he has to do is stand
up and he's shooting at you.

1548
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:14,271
Got that?

1549
01:11:14,562 --> 01:11:15,230
- Yeah, Jack!

1550
01:11:15,522 --> 01:11:17,649
You getting this?

1551
01:11:17,941 --> 01:11:18,692
- Yeah.

1552
01:11:18,984 --> 01:11:19,693
- Get going.

1553
01:11:19,985 --> 01:11:22,070
- You're due back in the vault now.

1554
01:11:22,362 --> 01:11:24,072
Don't stall on the way
and set off the alarm

1555
01:11:24,364 --> 01:11:27,075
or our friend in here is
gonna have to dust you.

1556
01:11:47,178 --> 01:11:48,888
- Jackpot, I did it!

1557
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:52,183
I hit a jackpot, I did it, I did it!

1558
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:54,978
- Another
giant $1,000 jackpot!

1559
01:11:55,270 --> 01:11:56,104
Machine C408.

1560
01:11:57,397 --> 01:11:59,399
A $1,000 jackpot!

1561
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:14,331
- Hold up.

1562
01:12:15,248 --> 01:12:17,250
- Here they go.

1563
01:13:00,752 --> 01:13:02,545
- You're all set.

1564
01:13:05,048 --> 01:13:06,508
- 10 cent.

1565
01:13:17,685 --> 01:13:18,436
- Having any luck?

1566
01:13:18,728 --> 01:13:22,440
- No, no, I won one
last time I was here.

1567
01:13:23,608 --> 01:13:24,734
- Of course, you'll do.

1568
01:13:28,696 --> 01:13:30,990
- Let's see, 10 cent machine.

1569
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:34,452
- Yeah.

1570
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:35,745
- Where's the quarter machine?

1571
01:13:36,037 --> 01:13:38,581
- They're down that way.

1572
01:13:38,873 --> 01:13:40,250
- Okay, good luck.

1573
01:13:42,252 --> 01:13:43,795
- Ah, clear.

1574
01:13:52,887 --> 01:13:54,222
- Now
dices are coming on out,

1575
01:13:54,514 --> 01:13:56,641
coming right out on the
old come out drawer.

1576
01:13:56,933 --> 01:13:57,767
- Come out on even.

1577
01:14:06,568 --> 01:14:08,903
Standing on the main line.

1578
01:14:09,195 --> 01:14:10,321
Here you are, 99 in your hand.

1579
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:12,073
- Fine, that's fine.

1580
01:14:12,365 --> 01:14:13,366
- Huh?
- Can't believe this thing.

1581
01:14:15,702 --> 01:14:17,078
- Your coin?

1582
01:14:18,496 --> 01:14:20,123
- What's your name?

1583
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:24,878
- Going?
- I think I won one last time.

1584
01:14:25,170 --> 01:14:26,212
- You got to go.

1585
01:14:31,426 --> 01:14:33,219
- Now, look, Eric.

1586
01:14:33,511 --> 01:14:35,930
We're going to pick up a bag
now and go outside the door.

1587
01:14:36,890 --> 01:14:38,558
We're going to a car we got
waiting out in the alley.

1588
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:41,019
We're going to blow the horn twice.

1589
01:14:41,311 --> 01:14:43,271
Now, the minute he hears it in there,

1590
01:14:43,563 --> 01:14:44,397
he's going to push out the sides

1591
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:46,274
and go out the door, too.

1592
01:14:46,566 --> 01:14:47,108
Now you wait right here

1593
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:48,860
till you hear the horn honk twice.

1594
01:14:49,944 --> 01:14:51,029
You getting this?

1595
01:14:52,113 --> 01:14:53,364
- Yeah, I'm getting it.

1596
01:14:54,699 --> 01:14:56,910
Look, I've done everything
you've asked me to.

1597
01:14:57,869 --> 01:15:00,413
I don't want him getting
wild at the last minute.

1598
01:15:03,166 --> 01:15:05,168
- Just follow instructions and
nobody's going to get hurt.

1599
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:07,879
He's not going to shoot
anybody he doesn't have to.

1600
01:15:14,135 --> 01:15:14,719
- Look out!

1601
01:15:15,011 --> 01:15:16,137
There's a man with a gun in there!

1602
01:15:23,478 --> 01:15:24,896
- Brick, this has gone far enough.

1603
01:15:40,203 --> 01:15:41,412
- I'm okay.

1604
01:16:04,352 --> 01:16:05,103
Al, I've gone to the
police, I've told them!

1605
01:16:05,395 --> 01:16:06,771
- Tell them to stay back.
- I've gone to the police.

1606
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:08,273
Darling, please, it's too late.

1607
01:16:08,565 --> 01:16:09,107
- It's in their hands.
- Look, Brick

1608
01:16:09,399 --> 01:16:09,941
is a real sick guy

1609
01:16:10,233 --> 01:16:11,150
but he's not gonna hurt
anybody unless he's crowded.

1610
01:16:11,442 --> 01:16:12,443
Now, tell them to stay back

1611
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:13,945
and give me a chance with him.

1612
01:16:14,237 --> 01:16:15,154
Tell them!

1613
01:17:27,644 --> 01:17:28,853
Hey, mister, did you see a big fellow

1614
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:30,104
come by here carrying a bag?

1615
01:17:30,396 --> 01:17:31,105
- Nope.

1616
01:17:34,192 --> 01:17:35,818
Sorry, sir, no people, just cars.

1617
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:37,612
- Look, I've got to find this guy.

1618
01:17:37,904 --> 01:17:40,657
- Look, buster, sorry,
no people, just cars.

1619
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:00,176
- Brick!

1620
01:18:01,636 --> 01:18:03,304
Brick, where are you?

1621
01:18:05,723 --> 01:18:06,474
Brick!

1622
01:18:16,484 --> 01:18:17,235
Brick!

1623
01:18:30,707 --> 01:18:31,999
- Please, you've got to believe me.

1624
01:18:32,291 --> 01:18:33,918
Look, if you'll just let him alone,

1625
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:35,503
then he might be able to get him down

1626
01:18:35,795 --> 01:18:36,713
without anyone being hurt.

1627
01:18:37,004 --> 01:18:38,297
- Look, lady, you never
know about a psycho,

1628
01:18:38,589 --> 01:18:41,134
especially if he's got a gun.
- No, no, please.

1629
01:18:45,722 --> 01:18:46,597
- Stay back!

1630
01:18:53,062 --> 01:18:53,813
- Stop!

1631
01:18:54,772 --> 01:18:55,523
- Hold it, Mac!

1632
01:19:22,425 --> 01:19:23,176
- Brick!

1633
01:19:24,427 --> 01:19:25,178
It's me. Al.

1634
01:19:43,446 --> 01:19:44,781
I'm not crowding you.

1635
01:19:50,328 --> 01:19:52,079
I wouldn't crowd you, Brick.

1636
01:19:55,958 --> 01:19:57,877
- I'm going to kill you.

1637
01:20:00,546 --> 01:20:01,297
- I'm going away.

1638
01:20:03,633 --> 01:20:05,676
I thought maybe you'd
like to come with me.

1639
01:20:09,514 --> 01:20:10,640
- I'm going to kill you.

1640
01:20:21,984 --> 01:20:23,861
- You remember the time you brought me in?

1641
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:30,576
I had a hole in my side.

1642
01:20:34,163 --> 01:20:35,957
The commies were shooting at you then.

1643
01:20:39,836 --> 01:20:41,712
Do you remember the tracer bullets?

1644
01:20:46,425 --> 01:20:49,971
How they lit up the snow
and made it look all red?

1645
01:20:53,599 --> 01:20:54,350
Remember?

1646
01:21:54,243 --> 01:21:56,245
- Just because I wanted to be a Mr. First.

1647
01:22:02,793 --> 01:22:03,544
- Hey.

1648
01:22:09,050 --> 01:22:10,301
- And will you check his records?

1649
01:22:10,593 --> 01:22:11,802
- We check everything.

1650
01:22:12,094 --> 01:22:12,845
- In Washington, I mean.

1651
01:22:13,137 --> 01:22:14,847
- I got most of the details from her.

1652
01:22:15,139 --> 01:22:16,349
I'll get the rest from you.

1653
01:22:17,516 --> 01:22:19,268
- What's going to happen to him?

1654
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:20,353
- Well, he'll have to stay

1655
01:22:20,645 --> 01:22:22,605
in the hospital this time until he's well.

1656
01:22:23,731 --> 01:22:24,398
- It certainly is a terrible way

1657
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:26,108
for you to start your marriage.

1658
01:22:27,693 --> 01:22:29,570
- You mean there's another way?

1659
01:22:29,862 --> 01:22:31,447
- Sure is.

1660
01:22:31,739 --> 01:22:33,157
There sure is, honey.
