Come on, let's go.

what my life is like ?

- Excuse me ?
- I wake up in the morning

Retail, Kate.

697
00:56:04,781 --> 00:56:08,327
I pick the kids up, 
walk the dog,

00:56:08,452 --> 00:56:11,371
which, by the way, 
carries the added bonus...

of carting away

all over again.

You know what ?
Maybe you're not.
