00:23:13,784 --> 00:23:16,495
- You stole my car.
- I know this whole thing is
really bizarre to you...

291
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,622
and you're feeling
quite shocked, but just hop in.

292
00:23:18,705 --> 00:23:22,334
I'll explain everything
to you, okay ?

293
00:23:22,417 --> 00:23:25,378
Come on.

294
00:23:25,503 --> 00:23:27,380
Come on.

295
00:23:33,677 --> 00:23:37,389
You're probably gonna
wanna buckle up, Jack.
This thing moves.

## [ Ends ]

297
00:23:41,434 --> 00:23:45,647
- What's happening to me ?
- Breathe into the bag, Jack.

298
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:49,692
This kind of thing makes
a lot of guys have to throw up.
I seen it happen before.

299
00:23:49,775 --> 00:23:53,279
So if you feel the urge,
you roll down the window
and do it out there.

[ Groaning ]
Try not to get
so worked up, Jack.

301
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,367
After all, you brought
this on yourself.

302
00:23:58,492 --> 00:24:00,577
Brought what on myself ?
I didn't do anything !

303
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:04,080
" I got everything I need."
That sound familiar ?

304
00:24:04,205 --> 00:24:08,543
You mean 'cause you thought
I was cocky, I'm now on
a permanent acid trip ?

305
00:24:08,668 --> 00:24:11,379
Bag yourself, Jack.

[ Screaming ]

307
00:24:14,965 --> 00:24:17,676
Oh, my God! Ah !

308
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:21,471
The way you intervened
in that store last night, you
did a good thing there, Jack.

309
00:24:21,555 --> 00:24:25,391
I mean, it was
incredibly impressive all
the way across the board...

310
00:24:25,475 --> 00:24:27,143
Oh, God !
to the upper echelons
of the organization.

311
00:24:27,268 --> 00:24:30,855
Please just tell me
what's happening to me
in plain English...

312
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,732
without the mumbo-jumbo.

313
00:24:33,816 --> 00:24:37,361
This is a glimpse, Jack.
A glimpse ?

314
00:24:37,486 --> 00:24:39,905
I--A glimpse of what ?

315
00:24:40,071 --> 00:24:42,907
You're gonna have to
figure that out for yourself
and you got plenty of time.

316
00:24:43,033 --> 00:24:44,701
- How much time ?
- As much time as it takes,

317
00:24:44,784 --> 00:24:46,911
which in your case is probably
gonna be considerable.

318
00:24:46,994 --> 00:24:50,623
Okay, look, look. I-I-I
just want my life back, okay ?

319
00:24:50,748 --> 00:24:54,084
Now, what's it gonna take ?
You wanna talk turkey ?

320
00:24:54,168 --> 00:24:56,837
Let's talk turkey.
How much money ?

321
00:24:56,962 --> 00:25:00,549
- It doesn't work like that,
and I can't tell you why.
- Why not ?

322
00:25:00,674 --> 00:25:03,593
Because you have to figure
this thing out for yourself.

323
00:25:03,718 --> 00:25:06,929
Are you listening to me ?
Figure it out, figure it out.
Figure out what ?

324
00:25:07,013 --> 00:25:10,266
- Let it come to you, man.
- I don't have time for this
right now.

325
00:25:10,433 --> 00:25:14,395
- I'm in the middle of a deal.
- Well, you're working on
a new deal now, baby.

326
00:25:18,565 --> 00:25:20,484
What's this ?
Open it.

327
00:25:20,567 --> 00:25:23,236
What is it,
some kind of a signal ?

328
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,699
[ Bell Dings ]
Will you come
whenever I ring it ?

329
00:25:28,783 --> 00:25:30,785
Now you gotta
get out of the car, Jack.

330
00:25:33,329 --> 00:25:36,665
But what do I do ?
I'm sorry. I can't spend
any more time with you.

331
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:40,418
I got some other business
I gotta take care of.
No, y-y-you did this to me.

332
00:25:40,544 --> 00:25:42,671
You can't just
leave me like this.

333
00:25:46,424 --> 00:25:49,719
Okay. Look, you wanna
get some air ? Let's get
outside, get some air.

334
00:25:49,802 --> 00:25:52,763
We'll walk and I'll explain
everything to you, okay ?

335
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:57,559
- Thanks, man.
- Sure.

336
00:26:48,981 --> 00:26:51,734
Excuse me. Do you know
where Merrison Street is ?

337
00:26:51,859 --> 00:26:53,944
[ Chuckles ]
Jeannie.

338
00:26:54,111 --> 00:26:56,780
I found Jack.
Oh, there you are, stranger.

339
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:00,367
Where you been ?

340
00:27:04,037 --> 00:27:06,289
[ Sighs ]

341
00:27:06,414 --> 00:27:09,750
You look terrible.
Truth is, I expected you.

342
00:27:09,834 --> 00:27:13,420
Kate called and asked
if I knew where you were, so--

343
00:27:16,465 --> 00:27:20,260
Oh, I put the Barcalounger
in the center of the room.
It's throwing everybody off.

344
00:27:20,343 --> 00:27:22,262
What do you think ?

345
00:27:26,099 --> 00:27:28,518
It's a great room.
Great room.

346
00:27:28,643 --> 00:27:30,436
You and me, buddy,
we know how to live, huh ?

347
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:32,396
Come on.

348
00:27:34,315 --> 00:27:37,442
Come on, Jack.

Come on, buddy.

Are you okay ?

352
00:27:54,166 --> 00:27:57,961
I mean, you take off Christmas
morning and you don't tell
anyone where you're going.

00:28:01,715 --> 00:28:05,426
- We're friends ?
- Talk to me.

I'm having kind of
a bad day.

355
00:28:11,515 --> 00:28:15,060
You know, I read somewhere
that the suicide rate doubles
during the holiday.

356

What am I saying that for ?
You don't wanna hear that.

Is it--
Is it trouble at work ?

each other's heads.

Kate's my wife.
[ Chuckles ]

362
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:42,335
Just keep saying it over
and over again, Jack,
like a mantra. Keep saying it.

363
00:28:49,467 --> 00:28:51,802
Look, you know,
you fit the profile exactly--

364
00:28:51,886 --> 00:28:56,265
in your 30s, house, kids,
financial responsibilities.

365

You start thinking
this isn't the life
I dreamt about.

366
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:02,520
Where's the romance,
you know ?

367
00:29:02,687 --> 00:29:05,064
Where's the joie de vivre ?

368
00:29:06,566 --> 00:29:10,528
Suddenly every lingerie ad
in the Newark Star-Ledger...

369
00:29:10,611 --> 00:29:13,197
represents a life
that you can't have.

370
00:29:16,325 --> 00:29:18,535
It's just two kids,
right ?

371
00:29:21,496 --> 00:29:24,124
Come on. Come on.

372
00:29:24,207 --> 00:29:27,919
All right, sometimes
it feels like you gave up
the whole world. I know that.

373
00:29:28,044 --> 00:29:31,380
But look what you got.
Look at that:
four bedrooms,

374
00:29:31,505 --> 00:29:34,550
two-and-a-half baths,
a partially finished basement.

375
00:29:34,675 --> 00:29:37,636
And good kids.
Look. You know what ?

376
00:29:37,803 --> 00:29:40,096
You probably don't wanna
hear this right now.

377
00:29:40,222 --> 00:29:43,975
But remember last summer when
I almost had that thing with
Arnie, Jr.'s speech therapist ?

378
00:29:44,058 --> 00:29:45,935
You remember what
you said to me ?

379
00:29:48,146 --> 00:29:50,898
You said, " Don't screw up
the best thing in your life...

just because
you're a little unsure
about who you are."

what you put us through today ?

where you're going,
or even that you're going.

And I don't see you
till hours later ?

390
00:31:14,391 --> 00:31:17,811
I called all of our friends.
I had the state troopers
looking for you.

00:31:17,936 --> 00:31:20,981
I was on the phone
with the hospital,
for God's sakes.

family Christmas morning without
a word about where he's going ?

does that, Jack ?

Could you--Could you please
stop yelling at me ?

that going to a party...

The closing tip was
a mildly bullish plus-76.

today was fueled by the latest

to hit Wall Street...

the largest ever
in the health care industry.

When asked about the possible
anti-competitive implications,

We had a lot of good times,
didn't we ?

740
00:58:49,367 --> 00:58:52,077
Do you remember
the place on Charles Street
where we used to go ?

741
00:58:52,203 --> 00:58:54,496
Charles Street ?

742
00:58:56,373 --> 00:58:58,834
In the village ?

743
00:58:58,959 --> 00:59:01,127
When we were living
in Greenwich Village.

744
00:59:01,253 --> 00:59:05,131
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Great times. Great place.

745
00:59:05,256 --> 00:59:07,133
Why did we ever leave ?

746
00:59:07,258 --> 00:59:10,469
You can't really raise a kid
in an apartment in the village.

747
00:59:10,594 --> 00:59:13,514
Then there was the whole trek
out to the hospital.
That didn't help either.

748
00:59:16,975 --> 00:59:20,353
You were great. I mean,
surviving the heart attack
was one thing.

749
00:59:20,437 --> 00:59:22,939
- You had a heart attack ?
- Hey, Jack, stop that.

750
00:59:23,064 --> 00:59:26,692
'Cause I am--
I'm still mad at you.

751
00:59:26,776 --> 00:59:31,322
Who knows what would
have happened if you hadn't
stepped in at the store ?

752
00:59:31,405 --> 00:59:34,241
That's why I work
for Big Ed.

753
00:59:36,076 --> 00:59:39,079
That's why I work
for Big Ed. Yeah.

754
00:59:41,623 --> 00:59:45,001
So we had a baby,
Big Ed had a heart attack.

755
00:59:45,084 --> 00:59:48,045
Bought that house,
and I've been working
for him ever since.

If you want to
look at it that way.

How would you look at it ?

760
01:00:03,184 --> 01:00:06,062
A great success story.

Show 'em how to do it, baby.
Jack, we need a strike.

- Damn !
-Jesus, Jack.
What are you doing ?

763
01:00:19,783 --> 01:00:23,786
It's a league match.
Where's your follow through ?
Where's your stance ?

764
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:27,039
You know what ?
I'm doing the best I can.

765
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:29,375
It's okay, Jack.

766

[ Arnie ]
Why am I so competitive
all the time ?

pick up that spare.
Crack 'em, Jack !

Here we go.
Hurt 'em.

769

You're Jack Campbell.
You're better than the sport.

770
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:45,973
You shot the rapids in Kanai.
You ran with the bulls
in Pamplona.

771
01:00:46,099 --> 01:00:48,893
You've jumped out of an airplane
over the Mojave Desert,
for Christ's sake.

772
01:00:49,018 --> 01:00:49,810
You can do this.
You can do this.

773

You can do this.
You can do this.

Huh ? All right!

High five !

You're up.
Go get 'em.

779
01:01:25,051 --> 01:01:27,178
Hi, Jack.

780
01:01:28,512 --> 01:01:32,391
Evelyn, right ?
[ Laughs ]
Very funny.

781
01:01:32,516 --> 01:01:35,352
I saw you on lane 20.
You got the flu
or something ?

782
01:01:35,477 --> 01:01:37,521
Something like that,
yeah.

783
01:01:37,688 --> 01:01:40,357
Need a nurse ?

784
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,359
Are you a nurse ?

785
01:01:42,442 --> 01:01:44,611
If that's what you want.

786
01:01:46,154 --> 01:01:48,531
Hey, wait a minute.

787
01:01:48,614 --> 01:01:50,950
Um, don't run away.

Are we what, Jack ?

790

Well--

791
01:01:59,207 --> 01:02:02,210
Is there something
going on between us ?

792
01:02:07,632 --> 01:02:10,217
Are we finally
being honest ?

793
01:02:10,343 --> 01:02:13,387
It would help me
if we were.

794
01:02:13,512 --> 01:02:15,556
Okay. You're right.

795

We've been dancing
around this for years.

[ Sighs ]
Here goes.

797
01:02:22,687 --> 01:02:26,357
When I get dressed
for a party, and I know
you're gonna be there,

798
01:02:26,566 --> 01:02:30,986
let's just say
I don't go strapless
because my husband likes it.

799
01:02:31,153 --> 01:02:34,740
I've got six sets
of snow tires piled up
in my garage,

800
01:02:34,865 --> 01:02:38,410
and I won't even drive
in the snow.

801
01:02:38,493 --> 01:02:41,079
And our kids
just happen to be...

802
01:02:41,204 --> 01:02:44,582
in the same ballet class
every year.

803
01:02:44,666 --> 01:02:49,337
So, if you're asking
whether I'd like it
to be more,

804
01:02:49,462 --> 01:02:52,298
the answer's yes.

805
01:02:52,381 --> 01:02:54,299
Kate would never
have to know.

806
01:02:58,512 --> 01:03:00,639
Do I have your number ?

807
01:03:02,349 --> 01:03:06,019
Steve's out of town
with the kids this weekend.

808
01:03:06,102 --> 01:03:08,563
Why don't you
just stop by ?

809
01:03:21,908 --> 01:03:24,327
Hey, Jack.
You're all flushed.

810
01:03:24,410 --> 01:03:26,996
I feel good.
Guess that 71 took
a lot out of you.

811
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:31,167
No. I just saw
Evelyn Thompson.

812
01:03:31,333 --> 01:03:33,210
She's relentless.

813
01:03:33,335 --> 01:03:35,587
She wants to have
an affair with me.

814
01:03:37,673 --> 01:03:40,342
- She said that ?
- Pretty much.

815
01:03:42,135 --> 01:03:44,387
What is it about you ?

816
01:03:44,512 --> 01:03:49,975
So... if you would write
her exact address down there.

817
01:03:50,101 --> 01:03:53,354
You have a pen ? Please.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on a second.

818
01:03:53,437 --> 01:03:56,940
You're not actually thinking
about cheating on Kate ?

819
01:03:57,107 --> 01:04:00,318
Well, it wouldn't really
be cheating, Arnie.

820
01:04:02,195 --> 01:04:03,655
It's complicated.

821
01:04:03,655 --> 01:04:04,614
It's complicated.

822
01:04:04,739 --> 01:04:08,326
Maybe I haven't been as good
a consigliere as you've been
to me, but hear me out on this.

823
01:04:08,492 --> 01:04:10,953
A little flirtation
is harmless,

824
01:04:11,078 --> 01:04:13,580
but you're dealing
with fire here, man.

825
01:04:13,664 --> 01:04:16,750
The Fidelity Bank and Trust
is a tough creditor.

826

somewhere else, they
close your account...

forever, all right ?

Arnie, I don't want
your head to explode,

829

but I'm telling you,
those rules don't apply to me.

in Union County who wouldn't
give his left nut...

01:04:38,729 --> 01:04:40,897
to be with Kate,
all right ?

835
01:04:41,064 --> 01:04:44,400
She's amazing, and you're
gonna fuck it up.

all right ?

Hey, honey.
How was the game ?

Long and boring
and generally pretty sad.

this chocolate cake ?
- That's my piece.

and you're quiet,

01:29:28,469 --> 01:29:30,846
you watch yourself,
stay away from Lassiter,

1178

keeping you on here

A company called P.K. Lassiter
Investment House...

new executives.

It's like the needy people

Your Jersey clients aren't
a tenth as pathetic as the
ones you could find here.

1220
01:31:55,771 --> 01:31:59,441
I can't even believe
you're talking about
moving back into the city.

1221
01:31:59,524 --> 01:32:03,194
I thought the reason we left
was because we didn't want to
raise the kids here.

1222

No. No.
This is the center

get us back on track.

01:56:55,604 --> 01:56:57,522
And Josh,

1490
01:56:57,606 --> 01:56:59,858
he has your eyes.

1491
01:57:00,025 --> 01:57:03,528
He doesn't say much,
but we know he's smart.

1492
01:57:03,611 --> 01:57:05,822
He's always got
his eyes open.

1493
01:57:05,947 --> 01:57:08,324
You know,
he's always watching us.

1494
01:57:08,449 --> 01:57:12,286
Sometimes you can look at him
and you just know...

1495
01:57:12,411 --> 01:57:14,997
he's learning something new.

1496
01:57:15,205 --> 01:57:17,624
It's like witnessing
a miracle.

1497
01:57:17,707 --> 01:57:21,503
The house is a mess,
but it's ours.

1498
01:57:21,628 --> 01:57:26,174
After 122 more payments,
it's going to be ours.

1499
01:57:26,299 --> 01:57:30,094
And you,
you're a nonprofit lawyer.

1500
01:57:30,177 --> 01:57:34,139
That's right.
You're completely nonprofit.

1501
01:57:34,264 --> 01:57:36,808
But that doesn't seem
to bother you.

1502
01:57:39,269 --> 01:57:42,063
And we're in love.

1503
01:57:42,147 --> 01:57:45,691
After 13 years of marriage,
we're still unbelievably
in love.

1504
01:57:47,318 --> 01:57:51,030
You won't even let me touch you
till I've said it.

1505
01:57:51,155 --> 01:57:53,032
I sing to you.

1506
01:57:53,115 --> 01:57:57,702
Not all the time,
but definitely
on special occasions.

1507
01:57:57,786 --> 01:58:02,415
And we've--we've dealt
with our share of surprises
and made a lot of sacrifices,

1508
01:58:02,499 --> 01:58:05,376
but we stayed together.

1509
01:58:05,460 --> 01:58:07,378
You see,

1510
01:58:08,629 --> 01:58:11,924
you're a better person
than I am,

1511
01:58:12,007 --> 01:58:16,762
and it made me
a better person
to be around you.

1512
01:58:16,845 --> 01:58:19,431
I don't know.
Maybe it was all
just a dream.

1513
01:58:19,556 --> 01:58:22,183
Maybe I went to bed
one lonely night
in December,

1514
01:58:22,308 --> 01:58:24,852
and I imagined it all,
but...

1515
01:58:25,019 --> 01:58:28,022
I swear, nothing's ever
felt more real.

1516
01:58:30,816 --> 01:58:34,862
And if you get
on that plane right now,

1517
01:58:34,987 --> 01:58:37,531
it'll disappear forever.

1518
01:58:40,492 --> 01:58:44,203
I know we could both
go on with our lives,
and we'd both be fine.

1519
01:58:44,329 --> 01:58:46,706
But I've seen...

1520
01:58:46,831 --> 01:58:48,958
what we could be like
together.

1521
01:58:52,836 --> 01:58:55,672
And I choose us.

1522
01:58:57,549 --> 01:58:59,426
Please, Kate.

1523
01:58:59,509 --> 01:59:02,470
One cup of coffee.

1524
01:59:02,554 --> 01:59:05,264
You can always
go to Paris.

1525
01:59:05,348 --> 01:59:07,975
Just... please,

1526
01:59:09,143 --> 01:59:11,061
not tonight.

1527
01:59:21,196 --> 01:59:23,114
Okay, Jack.

1528
01:59:28,619 --> 01:59:30,496
Okay.
