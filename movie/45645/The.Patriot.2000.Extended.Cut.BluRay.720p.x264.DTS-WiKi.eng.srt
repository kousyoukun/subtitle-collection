2
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,589
I have long feared...

3
00:01:08,509 --> 00:01:12,008
...that my sins would return
to visit me.

4
00:01:13,264 --> 00:01:16,134
And the cost is more than I can bear.

5
00:01:44,127 --> 00:01:46,166
Samuel! A postrider!

6
00:01:57,307 --> 00:01:58,302
An "R."

7
00:01:58,558 --> 00:01:59,720
Good.

8
00:02:01,561 --> 00:02:02,723
What about this one?

9
00:02:41,266 --> 00:02:43,139
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

10
00:03:25,643 --> 00:03:28,098
Father! Father!

11
00:03:29,521 --> 00:03:33,435
Nine pounds, eleven ounces.
That's perfect. Perfect.

12
00:03:34,026 --> 00:03:35,983
Father, a postrider!

13
00:03:36,695 --> 00:03:38,189
Did you finish planting
the field?

14
00:03:38,655 --> 00:03:39,650
More than half.

15
00:03:39,907 --> 00:03:43,240
Those swimming breaks really cut
into the day, don't they?

16
00:03:45,454 --> 00:03:46,829
Told you.

17
00:03:57,257 --> 00:03:58,501
Thomas.

18
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,080
Wait for Father.

19
00:05:00,151 --> 00:05:01,146
Sorry.

20
00:05:33,517 --> 00:05:37,051
That's her. The North Star.

21
00:05:38,397 --> 00:05:39,559
See?

22
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,190
You start from the front two stars
of the Big Dipper.

23
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,270
And then you count up.

24
00:05:45,404 --> 00:05:48,737
You count up five finger lengths...

25
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,659
...and it's right there.

26
00:05:52,994 --> 00:05:55,829
And she'll always be
looking down on us.

27
00:05:56,164 --> 00:05:59,248
And protect us. Forever.

28
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:02,836
Come. Into bed.

29
00:06:10,428 --> 00:06:12,883
Good night. Good night, Meg.

30
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:17,350
It helps her to know Mother's there.

31
00:06:21,897 --> 00:06:22,928
Good night.

32
00:07:05,023 --> 00:07:06,980
So what was in the mail?

33
00:07:18,744 --> 00:07:21,199
"The New York and
Pennsylvania assemblies...

34
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,655
...are debating independence."

35
00:07:23,874 --> 00:07:26,411
What about the middle colonies?

36
00:07:29,046 --> 00:07:31,334
"In Chestertown,
they burned the customs house...

37
00:07:31,548 --> 00:07:33,836
...and tar and feathered
two magistrates.

38
00:07:34,218 --> 00:07:36,506
They died of... They died of burns."

39
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,759
Damn fools.

40
00:07:38,972 --> 00:07:42,175
Who? The writers or the magistrates?

41
00:07:42,893 --> 00:07:45,893
What does it say about
the Continental Congress?

42
00:07:48,648 --> 00:07:53,190
It says here they'll make
a declaration of independence by July.

43
00:08:10,628 --> 00:08:12,667
Peter Cuppin joined the Continentals.

44
00:08:19,178 --> 00:08:21,466
He's 17, a year younger than I.

45
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:36,277
Well, the assembly's been convened,
so I've been called to Charles Town.

46
00:08:36,403 --> 00:08:38,478
- We're going to Charles Town?
- We are.

47
00:08:38,864 --> 00:08:40,108
We leave in the morning.

48
00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:24,277
Charlotte.

49
00:09:24,367 --> 00:09:26,442
The children are here.

50
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,655
Thank you.

51
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,795
Aunt Charlotte!

52
00:09:38,964 --> 00:09:40,873
Margaret, William, look at you.

53
00:09:41,925 --> 00:09:43,419
Missed you.

54
00:09:44,177 --> 00:09:46,798
They're huge.
What have you been feeding them?

55
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:51,138
Well, they're from good stock.
On their mother's side, of course.

56
00:09:52,185 --> 00:09:55,636
Thank you. Come inside.
Wait until you see what I have.

57
00:09:55,981 --> 00:09:58,436
- Presents? Presents for us?
- Move slowly.

58
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:01,105
Keep an eye on these heathens,
will you?

59
00:10:03,613 --> 00:10:04,608
Sorry.

60
00:10:12,789 --> 00:10:16,833
I have this for you, Susan.
It belonged to your mother.

61
00:10:23,007 --> 00:10:25,046
She's still not talking?

62
00:10:26,552 --> 00:10:27,880
No.

63
00:10:30,806 --> 00:10:32,597
It does me good to see you.

64
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:50,526
Look, there's Gabriel.

65
00:10:50,701 --> 00:10:52,823
Gabriel.

66
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,951
Hang King George!

67
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:10,131
Harry Burwell is here recruiting.

68
00:11:10,386 --> 00:11:13,339
The governor has vowed if the
assembly votes a single shilling...

69
00:11:13,514 --> 00:11:16,349
...to the Continental Army,
he'll dissolve the body.

70
00:11:18,227 --> 00:11:22,935
Wouldn't that force our delegates in
Philadelphia to vote for independence?

71
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:24,940
Yes.

72
00:11:25,609 --> 00:11:29,191
Send us off to war alongside
Massachusetts.

73
00:11:31,282 --> 00:11:34,282
Get King George!

74
00:11:34,952 --> 00:11:38,036
- Hang them all!
- Hang the lot of them!

75
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,579
That's enough.
Very well, children, inside.

76
00:11:41,792 --> 00:11:45,125
Come along now. Inside now.

77
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:57,217
Burwell will be counting on your vote.

78
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:00,758
And he'll expect you
to be the first to enlist.

79
00:12:00,977 --> 00:12:03,646
Yes, I imagine so.

80
00:12:05,523 --> 00:12:09,105
I'm sorry, the heathens are...

81
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:13,235
They have long needed
a woman in their lives.

82
00:12:14,324 --> 00:12:15,782
A mother.

83
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:18,238
Especially Susan.

84
00:12:29,922 --> 00:12:32,044
My name is Peter Howard.

85
00:12:32,716 --> 00:12:36,215
I lost most of my hearing
and my left leg...

86
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:40,094
...fighting for the Crown
in the French and Indian War.

87
00:12:40,808 --> 00:12:43,512
And how did King George reward me?

88
00:12:43,811 --> 00:12:46,515
He cuts off my other leg
with his taxes.

89
00:12:48,065 --> 00:12:49,772
Miss Howard, isn't it?

90
00:12:51,026 --> 00:12:52,899
You know who I am, Gabriel Martin.

91
00:12:54,488 --> 00:12:58,532
The last time you saw me,
I was 11 and you put ink in my tea.

92
00:12:59,409 --> 00:13:03,655
I believe that was one of my younger
brothers. Perhaps Samuel or Nathan.

93
00:13:04,164 --> 00:13:08,291
It was you, and it turned
my teeth black for a month.

94
00:13:10,837 --> 00:13:15,629
- And send a message to King George
he will never forget!

95
00:13:17,927 --> 00:13:19,302
Our first order of business...

96
00:13:19,554 --> 00:13:21,427
And our last, if we vote a levy!

97
00:13:21,931 --> 00:13:23,010
Order, order!

98
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,215
Mr. Simms, you do not have the floor.

99
00:13:25,601 --> 00:13:29,681
First, an address by Colonel
Harry Burwell of the Continental Army.

100
00:13:29,897 --> 00:13:31,272
Colonel Burwell.

101
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,232
You all know why I'm here.

102
00:13:37,738 --> 00:13:39,481
I'm not an orator.

103
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,451
And I would not try to convince you
of the worthiness of our cause.

104
00:13:45,787 --> 00:13:47,329
I'm a soldier.

105
00:13:48,123 --> 00:13:50,245
And we are at war.

106
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,410
From Philadelphia, we expect
a declaration of independence.

107
00:13:55,297 --> 00:13:57,752
8 of the 13 colonies have
levied money...

108
00:13:57,966 --> 00:14:00,088
...in support of a continental army.

109
00:14:00,552 --> 00:14:02,758
I ask that South Carolina be the ninth.

110
00:14:03,471 --> 00:14:06,637
Massachusetts and Virginia
may be at war...

111
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:09,008
...but South Carolina is not!

112
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:10,264
Hear, hear.

113
00:14:10,603 --> 00:14:14,647
This is not a war for the independence
of one or two colonies...

114
00:14:14,983 --> 00:14:17,189
...but for the independence
of one nation.

115
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,435
And what nation is that?

116
00:14:19,695 --> 00:14:21,901
An American nation!

117
00:14:22,114 --> 00:14:24,651
There is no such nation
and to speak of one is treason.

118
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:27,786
We are citizens
of an American nation.

119
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,700
And our rights are being threatened...

120
00:14:30,915 --> 00:14:33,452
...by a tyrant 3000 miles away.

121
00:14:33,751 --> 00:14:36,123
Would you tell me, please,
Mr. Howard...

122
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:40,251
...why should I trade one tyrant
3000 miles away...

123
00:14:40,507 --> 00:14:43,377
...for 3000 tyrants one mile away?

124
00:14:48,348 --> 00:14:52,641
An elected legislature can trample
a man's rights as easily as a king can.

125
00:14:53,854 --> 00:14:55,182
Captain Martin...

126
00:14:56,731 --> 00:14:58,438
...I understood you to be a patriot.

127
00:14:58,984 --> 00:15:02,566
If you mean by "patriot," am I angry
about taxation without representation?

128
00:15:02,737 --> 00:15:04,065
Well, yes, I am.

129
00:15:05,156 --> 00:15:09,449
Should the American colonies govern
themselves independently?

130
00:15:09,828 --> 00:15:12,615
I believe they can. And they should.

131
00:15:13,498 --> 00:15:17,080
But if you're asking me am I willing
to go to war with England...

132
00:15:17,335 --> 00:15:19,908
...then the answer is
most definitely no.

133
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:28,671
This from the same Captain Benjamin
Martin whose fury was so famous...

134
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:30,969
...during the Wilderness campaign?

135
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:34,182
I was intemperate in my youth.

136
00:15:34,435 --> 00:15:36,308
Temperance can be
a disguise for fear.

137
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:39,974
Mr. Middleton, I fought
with Captain Martin...

138
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,859
...under Washington
in the French and Indian War.

139
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:45,146
There's not a man in this room...

140
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:49,573
...or anywhere for that matter, to whom
I would more willingly trust my life.

141
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,781
There are alternatives to war.

142
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,036
We take our case before the king.

143
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:57,706
- We plead with him.
- We tried.

144
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:01,415
Well, then, we try again and again
if necessary to avoid a war.

145
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,419
I was at Bunker Hill.

146
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,337
The British advanced three times.

147
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:11,631
We killed 700 at point-blank range
and still they took the ground.

148
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:14,925
That is the measure of their resolve.

149
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,221
If your principles dictate
independence...

150
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,766
...then war is the only way.

151
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:22,849
It is come to that.

152
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,559
Hear, hear.

153
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,561
I have seven children.

154
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,816
My wife is dead.

155
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,864
Now, who's to care for them
if I go to war?

156
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,663
Wars are not fought
only by childless men.

157
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,530
Granted.

158
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,412
But mark my words.

159
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:53,588
This war will be fought,
not on the frontier...

160
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:56,597
...or on some distant battlefield...

161
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,265
...but amongst us.

162
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,433
Among our homes.

163
00:17:02,562 --> 00:17:05,562
Our children will learn of it
with their own eyes.

164
00:17:08,651 --> 00:17:11,486
And the innocent will die
with the rest of us.

165
00:17:15,491 --> 00:17:17,068
I will not fight.

166
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:20,870
And because I will not fight,
I will not cast a vote...

167
00:17:21,122 --> 00:17:23,873
...that will send others to fight
in my stead.

168
00:17:26,085 --> 00:17:28,077
And your principles?

169
00:17:31,632 --> 00:17:34,798
I'm a parent. I haven't got
the luxury of principles.

170
00:17:43,811 --> 00:17:45,602
We must vote to levy!

171
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,567
28 to 12! The levy passed!

172
00:18:32,733 --> 00:18:34,690
You intend to enlist
without my permission?

173
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:36,777
Yes, I do.

174
00:18:42,493 --> 00:18:46,360
Father, I thought you were
a man of principle.

175
00:18:50,417 --> 00:18:53,667
When you have a family of your own,
perhaps you'll understand.

176
00:18:56,381 --> 00:18:59,547
When I have a family of my own,
I won't hide behind them.

177
00:19:15,817 --> 00:19:19,648
He's as imprudent as his father was
at his age.

178
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:21,695
Regrettably so.

179
00:19:23,658 --> 00:19:26,195
I'll see to it that he
serves under me.

180
00:19:27,245 --> 00:19:31,408
Make him a clerk or quartermaster,
something of that sort.

181
00:19:33,918 --> 00:19:35,376
Good luck.

182
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,815
Dear Thomas:
Though many seasons have passed...

183
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:07,275
...it seems like only yesterday when we
last saw each other in Charles Town.

184
00:20:07,951 --> 00:20:11,035
With sadness, I learned
of its recent fall to the British...

185
00:20:11,287 --> 00:20:12,911
...under General Cornwallis.

186
00:20:17,085 --> 00:20:19,077
I received a letter
from Aunt Charlotte...

187
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:22,752
...saying she closed her home
in Charles Town after the city fell...

188
00:20:22,924 --> 00:20:25,841
...and moved to her plantation
on the Santee.

189
00:20:36,145 --> 00:20:40,771
Here in the north, our campaign has
been marked by defeat and privation.

190
00:20:42,484 --> 00:20:44,606
Our losses have been grievous.

191
00:20:50,909 --> 00:20:55,155
My good friend, Peter Cuppin,
fell at Elizabethtown.

192
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,624
His death has been difficult to bear.

193
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,967
We will march south
with General Gates...

194
00:21:20,229 --> 00:21:23,016
...to fight the Redcoats
under Cornwallis.

195
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:27,147
Thank you, sir.

196
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,583
I envy you...

197
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:47,295
...your youth and distance from this
cruel conflict of which I am a part.

198
00:21:48,757 --> 00:21:51,544
"But I am fortunate to be
serving the cause of Liberty.

199
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,927
And though I fear death...

200
00:21:55,097 --> 00:21:57,884
...each day in prayer I reaffirm
my willingness...

201
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,306
...to give my life in its service.

202
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:02,384
Pray for me.

203
00:22:04,064 --> 00:22:06,436
But above all, pray for the cause.

204
00:22:07,567 --> 00:22:09,440
Your loving brother, Gabriel."

205
00:22:45,729 --> 00:22:46,724
What are you doing?

206
00:22:53,487 --> 00:22:54,767
Turn around.

207
00:22:59,743 --> 00:23:01,782
Not yet, Thomas.

208
00:23:02,245 --> 00:23:03,240
When?

209
00:23:08,418 --> 00:23:09,413
Seventeen.

210
00:23:11,046 --> 00:23:13,797
That's two years.
It's already been two.

211
00:23:14,048 --> 00:23:17,048
- The war could be over by then.
- God willing.

212
00:23:21,347 --> 00:23:24,016
All right. Seventeen.

213
00:23:27,478 --> 00:23:28,640
All right.

214
00:23:36,195 --> 00:23:37,689
Put it back, please.

215
00:23:41,867 --> 00:23:43,325
Father?

216
00:23:44,578 --> 00:23:46,866
What happened at Fort Wilderness?

217
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:51,411
Put it away.

218
00:23:57,466 --> 00:24:00,881
- Throw it faster.
- You throw it faster. You're the one...

219
00:24:12,939 --> 00:24:16,438
Margaret, you go get your brothers
back up here right now.

220
00:25:21,547 --> 00:25:24,998
Back to the house. Come on.
Back to the house now.

221
00:25:25,343 --> 00:25:29,257
Come with me. Margaret, go now.

222
00:25:36,604 --> 00:25:37,848
They're going to come.

223
00:25:38,105 --> 00:25:40,940
Quiet. Sit down.

224
00:26:12,597 --> 00:26:14,091
Six-pounders.

225
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:15,594
Lots of them.

226
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:17,839
How far away?

227
00:26:18,853 --> 00:26:22,767
They're a long way off. They're most
likely heading the other direction.

228
00:26:24,609 --> 00:26:26,186
Put those in the house.

229
00:26:26,694 --> 00:26:29,149
- They might come this way.
- Must I tell you again?

230
00:26:32,658 --> 00:26:35,528
Let's all stay close in to the house,
all right?

231
00:26:55,722 --> 00:26:57,097
We'll have to fight them off.

232
00:26:57,474 --> 00:26:59,181
Won't Father do that?

233
00:27:00,227 --> 00:27:02,599
They'll probably kill us men...

234
00:27:04,481 --> 00:27:06,603
...and do Lord-knows-what
to you women.

235
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:08,435
Nathan!

236
00:27:35,011 --> 00:27:36,291
Slowly turn.

237
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:41,094
Father.

238
00:27:44,395 --> 00:27:45,675
Abigale!

239
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,104
Water and bandages, fast.

240
00:27:52,945 --> 00:27:54,652
The battle. Were you there?

241
00:27:55,322 --> 00:27:56,899
Have you seen any Redcoats?

242
00:27:57,157 --> 00:27:58,699
No, not yet.

243
00:27:58,992 --> 00:28:01,447
Abigale, the children, please.

244
00:28:01,745 --> 00:28:04,117
Children, come. Upstairs.

245
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,292
Gates marched us straight
at the Redcoats.

246
00:28:12,505 --> 00:28:16,253
Our lines broke. The British
Green Dragoons cut us to bits.

247
00:28:16,509 --> 00:28:18,715
I was given these dispatches.

248
00:28:19,137 --> 00:28:22,885
As I left, I saw
the Virginia Regulars surrender.

249
00:28:26,102 --> 00:28:28,011
The Dragoons rode into them.

250
00:28:29,772 --> 00:28:30,767
Killed them all.

251
00:28:32,149 --> 00:28:33,773
Over 200 men.

252
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:36,820
I have to get these dispatches
to Hillsborough.

253
00:28:37,071 --> 00:28:38,233
You can't ride.

254
00:28:38,489 --> 00:28:40,695
I can't stay here!
It's not safe for...

255
00:29:14,065 --> 00:29:15,523
Fire!

256
00:29:23,866 --> 00:29:25,324
Fire!

257
00:31:49,091 --> 00:31:51,498
Thank you for the care
of His Majesty's soldiers.

258
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:25,790
Have a detachment take our wounded
to our surgeons at Winnsboro.

259
00:32:26,336 --> 00:32:27,415
Yes, sir.

260
00:32:29,297 --> 00:32:30,459
Fire the house and barns.

261
00:32:32,925 --> 00:32:36,091
Let it be known if you harbour
the enemy you will lose your home.

262
00:32:40,182 --> 00:32:42,055
By order of King George...

263
00:32:42,268 --> 00:32:45,683
...all slaves of the American colonies
who fight for the Crown...

264
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:49,313
...will be granted their freedom
with our victory.

265
00:32:51,318 --> 00:32:54,900
We're not slaves. We work this land.
We're freedmen.

266
00:32:55,114 --> 00:32:58,198
Then you're freedmen who will have
the privilege...

267
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:00,572
...of fighting in the king's army.

268
00:33:06,541 --> 00:33:08,332
Rebel dispatches, sir.

269
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,174
Who carried this?

270
00:33:25,351 --> 00:33:26,382
Who carried this?!

271
00:33:27,437 --> 00:33:28,468
I did, sir.

272
00:33:35,403 --> 00:33:37,360
I was wounded.
These people gave me care.

273
00:33:38,406 --> 00:33:40,778
They have nothing to do
with the dispatches.

274
00:33:43,744 --> 00:33:45,617
Take this one to Camden.
He is a spy.

275
00:33:45,871 --> 00:33:47,993
Hang him, put his body on display.

276
00:33:48,541 --> 00:33:50,367
He's a dispatch rider.

277
00:33:50,626 --> 00:33:53,295
Destroy the livestock.
Save the horses for the Dragoons.

278
00:33:54,046 --> 00:33:57,877
Colonel, this is a uniformed
dispatch rider carrying a marked case.

279
00:33:58,091 --> 00:33:59,419
He cannot be held as a spy.

280
00:33:59,635 --> 00:34:02,339
Well, we won't hold him.
We're going to hang him.

281
00:34:05,932 --> 00:34:07,474
- Colonel...
- Father!

282
00:34:10,896 --> 00:34:13,849
Oh, I see. He's your son.

283
00:34:14,858 --> 00:34:17,728
Perhaps you should've taught him
something of loyalty.

284
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:23,281
Colonel, I beg you, please reconsider.
By the rules of war...

285
00:34:23,491 --> 00:34:27,073
Would you like a lesson, sir,
in the rules of war?

286
00:34:29,998 --> 00:34:31,705
Or perhaps your children would.

287
00:34:36,838 --> 00:34:38,332
No lesson is necessary.

288
00:34:41,467 --> 00:34:42,498
Sir.

289
00:34:42,802 --> 00:34:44,593
What of the rebel wounded?

290
00:34:47,097 --> 00:34:48,341
Kill them.

291
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,391
Father.

292
00:34:58,525 --> 00:35:00,232
Father, do something!

293
00:35:00,527 --> 00:35:01,522
Be quiet!

294
00:35:14,332 --> 00:35:16,205
Gabriel, run!

295
00:35:17,335 --> 00:35:18,330
Wait!

296
00:35:21,089 --> 00:35:22,333
No!!

297
00:35:48,908 --> 00:35:50,781
Stupid boy.

298
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:58,034
Captain.

299
00:36:02,796 --> 00:36:04,669
Thomas!

300
00:36:59,977 --> 00:37:01,387
Come, child.

301
00:37:03,188 --> 00:37:05,643
I'm not leaving these children!

302
00:37:05,857 --> 00:37:07,232
Mercy!

303
00:37:08,485 --> 00:37:10,027
Get ready!

304
00:37:10,195 --> 00:37:11,190
Present!

305
00:37:11,404 --> 00:37:12,483
Fire!

306
00:37:56,699 --> 00:37:58,109
All of you, stay here.

307
00:38:33,526 --> 00:38:34,984
Nathan, Samuel.

308
00:38:39,782 --> 00:38:40,944
Margaret.

309
00:38:43,369 --> 00:38:45,906
Hide in the fields
with William and Susan.

310
00:38:46,122 --> 00:38:48,957
If we're not back by sunset,
take them to Aunt Charlotte's.

311
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:51,497
- Is that clear?
- Yeah.

312
00:38:52,169 --> 00:38:53,248
Boys.

313
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:47,883
It's a good spot.

314
00:39:49,308 --> 00:39:51,430
Boys, listen to me.

315
00:39:51,936 --> 00:39:53,643
I'll fire first.

316
00:39:55,731 --> 00:39:58,648
Start with the officers
and work your way down.

317
00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:00,518
Can you tell the difference?

318
00:40:00,736 --> 00:40:01,565
Yes, Father.

319
00:40:02,029 --> 00:40:03,653
- Yes, Father.
- Good.

320
00:40:04,406 --> 00:40:06,778
Samuel, after your first shot,
reload for Nathan.

321
00:40:08,076 --> 00:40:09,071
Now...

322
00:40:09,369 --> 00:40:11,990
...if anything should happen to me,
drop your weapons.

323
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:13,954
Run as quickly as you can.

324
00:40:14,082 --> 00:40:16,655
Get your brother and your sisters...

325
00:40:16,877 --> 00:40:19,628
...and take them to
Aunt Charlotte's. Understood?

326
00:40:21,172 --> 00:40:22,796
What did I say about shooting?

327
00:40:23,341 --> 00:40:24,503
Aim small, miss small.

328
00:40:25,093 --> 00:40:26,800
Aim small, miss small.

329
00:40:28,012 --> 00:40:29,174
Boys...

330
00:40:29,681 --> 00:40:31,009
...Samuel...

331
00:40:31,391 --> 00:40:32,719
...steady.

332
00:41:20,272 --> 00:41:22,727
Lord, make me fast and accurate.

333
00:41:24,275 --> 00:41:26,647
Aim small, miss small.

334
00:41:26,903 --> 00:41:29,654
Aim small, miss small.

335
00:41:29,906 --> 00:41:32,610
Aim small, miss small.

336
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,922
- On the right!
- To the left!

337
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,255
Behind us! Up on the ridge!

338
00:42:00,769 --> 00:42:02,097
Form right!

339
00:42:04,106 --> 00:42:05,101
To the right!

340
00:42:07,234 --> 00:42:08,609
About face!

341
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:12,940
On the right to the rear!

342
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:15,776
To the right!

343
00:42:15,951 --> 00:42:16,946
Fire!

344
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:20,236
- Reload!
- Reload!

345
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,932
Behind you!

346
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:47,349
Look on the rear!

347
00:47:15,242 --> 00:47:16,356
Lord...

348
00:47:17,619 --> 00:47:20,323
...we pray that you accept this child...

349
00:47:20,497 --> 00:47:23,497
...and keep him at your side
with his mother.

350
00:47:24,668 --> 00:47:27,419
We ask that you embrace him...

351
00:47:29,714 --> 00:47:34,091
...and help us to understand the
manner in which your mercy works.

352
00:47:34,594 --> 00:47:37,429
And forgive us our sins.

353
00:47:37,597 --> 00:47:40,763
This we ask in your name.

354
00:47:40,933 --> 00:47:42,724
Amen.

355
00:48:07,709 --> 00:48:10,579
Sir, we have the private
the Cherokee scouts brought in.

356
00:48:22,057 --> 00:48:23,467
Private?

357
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:24,762
Private.

358
00:48:25,018 --> 00:48:26,975
Colonel William Tavington,
Green Dragoons.

359
00:48:27,896 --> 00:48:30,184
What happened? Who did this?

360
00:48:31,107 --> 00:48:32,186
Him.

361
00:48:33,526 --> 00:48:34,936
It was mad.

362
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:37,444
I couldn't tell you who it was.

363
00:48:37,697 --> 00:48:39,736
Calm down. Calm down, man.

364
00:48:40,408 --> 00:48:43,243
Twenty of His Majesty's soldiers
are dead.

365
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:45,825
And I need to know how.

366
00:48:46,038 --> 00:48:48,113
- He said there was...
- Were you there?

367
00:48:48,708 --> 00:48:50,747
Then let him speak.

368
00:48:51,252 --> 00:48:54,751
Take your time and tell me.
How many were there?

369
00:48:55,005 --> 00:48:56,878
Were they militia?
Were they Regulars?

370
00:48:57,424 --> 00:48:59,582
I don't really remember how many.

371
00:49:02,179 --> 00:49:03,258
Maybe one.

372
00:49:05,516 --> 00:49:07,923
One man. Really?

373
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:10,017
He was in the flank.

374
00:49:11,522 --> 00:49:13,146
All around us.

375
00:49:13,523 --> 00:49:15,017
Amongst us.

376
00:49:15,609 --> 00:49:18,230
I could barely see him.
He was there, then he was gone.

377
00:49:18,362 --> 00:49:20,021
He just vanished.

378
00:49:21,239 --> 00:49:23,564
Sounds more like a ghost than a man.

379
00:49:23,992 --> 00:49:25,534
A ghost.

380
00:49:26,995 --> 00:49:28,702
He was like a ghost.

381
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:31,618
Enough.

382
00:49:33,751 --> 00:49:36,455
Bordon? Take a patrol.

383
00:49:36,671 --> 00:49:39,624
Capture this ghost before
word of his exploits spread.

384
00:49:39,841 --> 00:49:42,758
- Who's this?
- Sir, this is Captain Wilkins.

385
00:49:42,969 --> 00:49:46,468
He was with the Loyalist Colonial
Militia. He might be of use.

386
00:49:46,973 --> 00:49:48,597
Another colonial.

387
00:49:49,267 --> 00:49:51,722
Captain Wilkins,
where do your loyalties lie?

388
00:49:52,019 --> 00:49:53,098
To king and country.

389
00:49:53,437 --> 00:49:55,892
Why should I trust a man who'd
betray his neighbours?

390
00:49:56,732 --> 00:49:59,732
Those neighbours of mine who stand
against England...

391
00:49:59,985 --> 00:50:01,692
...deserve to die a traitor's death.

392
00:50:02,863 --> 00:50:03,858
We'll see.

393
00:50:10,204 --> 00:50:11,532
Mr. Martin!

394
00:50:18,003 --> 00:50:19,627
Miss Charlotte!

395
00:50:31,266 --> 00:50:34,053
You're safe now. Try to sleep.

396
00:50:34,269 --> 00:50:35,513
Good night.

397
00:50:35,895 --> 00:50:36,974
Good night.

398
00:50:37,605 --> 00:50:38,933
Father?

399
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:40,434
Yes.

400
00:50:41,401 --> 00:50:43,523
I killed those men.

401
00:50:44,779 --> 00:50:46,237
You did what I told you to do.

402
00:50:47,698 --> 00:50:50,782
You did what you had to.
There was no wrong in it.

403
00:50:53,245 --> 00:50:55,320
I'm glad I killed them.

404
00:50:59,001 --> 00:51:00,543
I'm glad.

405
00:51:10,387 --> 00:51:11,881
Get some rest.

406
00:51:19,563 --> 00:51:20,891
Samuel.

407
00:51:41,626 --> 00:51:44,959
You've done nothing for which
you should be ashamed.

408
00:51:46,839 --> 00:51:48,416
I've done nothing.

409
00:51:50,218 --> 00:51:52,257
And for that, I am ashamed.

410
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,959
We'll go to Saint Helena.

411
00:52:34,385 --> 00:52:38,548
That's a free slave island
just north of Charles Town.

412
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:41,176
Right under the British noses.

413
00:52:41,351 --> 00:52:44,684
- They won't think of look...
- I'm joining up with them.

414
00:52:45,354 --> 00:52:46,896
Gabriel.

415
00:52:48,983 --> 00:52:51,022
No. Your place is here now.

416
00:52:51,068 --> 00:52:53,356
I'm going back.
I'm a soldier, it's my duty.

417
00:52:54,196 --> 00:52:56,271
Your duty is to your family.

418
00:52:58,033 --> 00:52:59,906
Don't you walk away from me, boy!

419
00:53:00,077 --> 00:53:01,452
I'll find you when it's over.

420
00:53:01,495 --> 00:53:03,452
No, I forbid you to go!

421
00:53:03,581 --> 00:53:06,118
- I'm not a child!
- You're my child!

422
00:53:08,794 --> 00:53:10,252
Goodbye, Father.

423
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:13,212
Gabriel.

424
00:53:13,882 --> 00:53:15,506
Thomas is dead.

425
00:53:16,093 --> 00:53:18,928
How many more have to die
before you'll heed my word?

426
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,957
I'm losing my family.

427
00:53:54,672 --> 00:53:56,747
When will you be back, Father?

428
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,175
I don't know.

429
00:53:59,635 --> 00:54:00,915
Tomorrow?

430
00:54:01,345 --> 00:54:03,004
No, not tomorrow.

431
00:54:03,639 --> 00:54:05,346
You say your prayers.

432
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:06,761
I will.

433
00:54:07,518 --> 00:54:11,100
Take care of your brothers and sisters
and your Aunt Charlotte.

434
00:54:11,355 --> 00:54:13,228
I'm depending on you.

435
00:54:14,233 --> 00:54:16,106
As I am on you, Samuel.

436
00:54:17,611 --> 00:54:18,642
All right.

437
00:54:25,619 --> 00:54:26,863
Susan...

438
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:30,360
...goodbye.

439
00:54:45,304 --> 00:54:46,548
Thank you.

440
00:56:54,639 --> 00:56:56,049
Halt!

441
00:57:00,269 --> 00:57:01,893
Make ready!

442
00:57:06,775 --> 00:57:08,352
Take aim!

443
00:57:12,781 --> 00:57:14,156
Fire!

444
00:57:26,211 --> 00:57:27,918
I'm not going back.

445
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:30,836
No, I didn't expect you would.

446
00:57:35,428 --> 00:57:37,716
That Gates is a damn fool.

447
00:57:39,682 --> 00:57:41,970
He spent too many years
in the British army.

448
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:46,354
Going muzzle-to-muzzle with Redcoats
in open field. It's madness.

449
00:57:47,065 --> 00:57:48,144
Halt!

450
00:57:48,608 --> 00:57:50,315
Make ready!

451
00:57:50,985 --> 00:57:52,776
Present!

452
00:57:53,821 --> 00:57:55,065
Fire!

453
00:58:17,845 --> 00:58:20,466
This battle was over before it began.

454
00:58:30,148 --> 00:58:31,392
Retreat!

455
00:58:32,025 --> 00:58:33,851
Retreat!

456
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:43,487
These rustics are so inept.

457
00:58:43,912 --> 00:58:46,367
Nearly takes the honour
out of victory.

458
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:48,452
Nearly.

459
00:59:10,187 --> 00:59:12,226
Hello general, gentlemen.

460
00:59:12,439 --> 00:59:15,190
A glorious day
for His Majesty and England.

461
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:17,481
Colonel Tavington.

462
00:59:17,736 --> 00:59:20,606
Always too early.

463
00:59:20,864 --> 00:59:22,358
Always too eager for glory.

464
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:26,451
For victory, my lord.

465
00:59:27,037 --> 00:59:28,910
I believe we took the field.

466
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:31,701
Next time, you'll wait
for my command.

467
00:59:32,292 --> 00:59:36,669
It appears that Colonel Tavington
prefers to follow his own commands.

468
00:59:36,921 --> 00:59:38,249
General O'Hara tells me...

469
00:59:38,423 --> 00:59:42,254
...you've earned the nickname
"The Butcher" among the populous.

470
00:59:42,468 --> 00:59:44,425
We'll discuss it tomorrow.

471
00:59:44,804 --> 00:59:47,425
Gentlemen, my compliments.

472
00:59:47,598 --> 00:59:50,053
- To a victory.
- Hear, hear.

473
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:01,398
Hold him firm.

474
01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:22,547
- Where's your commanding officer?
- That tent there.

475
01:00:29,306 --> 01:00:31,097
It's a lost cause.

476
01:00:47,907 --> 01:00:49,449
Benjamin Martin.

477
01:00:49,659 --> 01:00:51,616
I'm in no mood for a lecture.

478
01:00:51,994 --> 01:00:54,282
Where's your General Gates now?

479
01:00:54,664 --> 01:00:58,791
The last anyone saw,
riding hard northeast...

480
01:00:59,043 --> 01:01:01,960
...his staff 100 yards behind,
trying to catch up.

481
01:01:02,838 --> 01:01:04,545
So who's in command?

482
01:01:05,132 --> 01:01:06,330
I am.

483
01:01:07,384 --> 01:01:08,842
I think.

484
01:01:10,012 --> 01:01:11,387
What are my orders?

485
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:19,476
We're a breath away from losing
this war, Benjamin.

486
01:01:22,316 --> 01:01:25,316
In the north, Washington is
reeling from Morristown.

487
01:01:25,569 --> 01:01:28,238
He's running and hiding
from 12,000 Redcoats.

488
01:01:28,488 --> 01:01:31,025
In the south, Cornwallis has
broken our back.

489
01:01:31,241 --> 01:01:34,491
Captured over 5000 of our troops
when he took Charles Town.

490
01:01:34,744 --> 01:01:37,828
And he destroyed the only army
between him and New York.

491
01:01:39,582 --> 01:01:42,832
Nothing will stop him from
heading north to finish off Washington.

492
01:01:43,253 --> 01:01:47,001
Unless we can keep Cornwallis
in the south till the French arrive.

493
01:01:48,257 --> 01:01:51,127
They've promised a fleet
and 10,000 troops.

494
01:01:51,386 --> 01:01:53,010
When?

495
01:01:54,055 --> 01:01:56,380
Six months at the earliest.

496
01:01:56,724 --> 01:01:59,012
You trust the French
to keep their word?

497
01:01:59,268 --> 01:02:00,548
Absolument.

498
01:02:02,938 --> 01:02:05,607
Benjamin Martin.
Major Jean Villeneuve.

499
01:02:05,775 --> 01:02:08,526
French Seventh Light Foot.
He will help train the militia.

500
01:02:09,445 --> 01:02:12,695
The hero of Fort Wilderness.
Your reputation precedes you.

501
01:02:17,619 --> 01:02:20,703
You really expect to hold Cornwallis
here using just militia?

502
01:02:20,998 --> 01:02:23,204
Not me. You.

503
01:02:25,544 --> 01:02:27,417
They're not soldiers, they're farmers.

504
01:02:27,629 --> 01:02:30,298
They'd be better off letting
the British march through.

505
01:02:30,507 --> 01:02:33,211
They'd be better off,
but the cause wouldn't.

506
01:02:34,261 --> 01:02:36,300
How many men
does Cornwallis have?

507
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:38,719
8000 infantry.

508
01:02:38,973 --> 01:02:41,214
Around 600 cavalry.

509
01:02:41,601 --> 01:02:44,138
I'm giving you a field commission
as a colonel.

510
01:02:44,604 --> 01:02:47,439
Might I request that you transfer
my son under my command?

511
01:02:47,482 --> 01:02:48,976
Sir, no, I...

512
01:02:49,192 --> 01:02:50,520
That's done.

513
01:02:54,030 --> 01:02:55,109
Thank you.

514
01:02:57,116 --> 01:02:58,942
Colonel, I've been a soldier
for two years.

515
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:01,782
As a scout, horseman,
marksman, scavenger.

516
01:03:01,996 --> 01:03:04,533
- Is that so?
- I'd be of better use with Regulars.

517
01:03:04,749 --> 01:03:06,871
Where'd you learn all that
riding, shooting, scavenging?

518
01:03:07,084 --> 01:03:08,708
My father taught me.

519
01:03:10,754 --> 01:03:12,331
Teach you any humility?

520
01:03:13,007 --> 01:03:14,584
He tried. It didn't take.

521
01:03:16,093 --> 01:03:19,675
He also taught you every trail
between here and Charles Town...

522
01:03:19,805 --> 01:03:21,631
...which is why he transferred you.

523
01:03:22,349 --> 01:03:24,970
We'll put the word out.
Start on the south side of...

524
01:03:25,227 --> 01:03:27,433
We'll cover more ground
if we split up.

525
01:03:31,024 --> 01:03:34,392
Very well, corporal. You take
Harrisville, Pembroke, Wakefield.

526
01:03:34,778 --> 01:03:38,941
I'll start on the north side.
Meet at the mission in Black Swamp.

527
01:03:42,952 --> 01:03:44,031
Corporal.

528
01:03:45,788 --> 01:03:47,282
Be careful.

529
01:03:49,584 --> 01:03:50,746
Yes, sir.

530
01:03:55,715 --> 01:03:57,209
You have children?

531
01:04:01,929 --> 01:04:03,304
French.

532
01:04:27,412 --> 01:04:29,203
It skirts the mountain and then...

533
01:04:29,456 --> 01:04:31,744
...extends down towards
the headwater here...

534
01:04:32,042 --> 01:04:35,541
...and right across to the far bank
of the Ohio River.

535
01:04:35,921 --> 01:04:37,201
It's 100,000 acres.

536
01:04:37,464 --> 01:04:39,752
It's an imposing land grant, my lord.

537
01:04:39,966 --> 01:04:42,635
You will be a country unto yourself.

538
01:04:46,347 --> 01:04:48,054
His Majesty is most generous.

539
01:04:50,852 --> 01:04:54,683
Though your service in this war
more than warrants such a gift.

540
01:04:55,648 --> 01:05:00,356
Yes, this is how His Majesty
rewards those...

541
01:05:00,611 --> 01:05:02,650
...who fight for him as gentlemen.

542
01:05:02,947 --> 01:05:06,991
I dare to presume my own meagre
contributions will be rewarded one day.

543
01:05:07,201 --> 01:05:09,240
You may presume too much.

544
01:05:09,954 --> 01:05:13,453
His Majesty, like history,
judges us by the outcome of the war...

545
01:05:13,749 --> 01:05:15,788
...and the manner in which
it was fought.

546
01:05:16,877 --> 01:05:19,712
We serve the Crown, and we must
conduct ourselves accordingly.

547
01:05:20,756 --> 01:05:22,748
Surrendering troops
will be given quarter.

548
01:05:23,175 --> 01:05:25,297
These brutal tactics must stop!

549
01:05:25,969 --> 01:05:28,376
Is it not enough that I have
never lost a battle?

550
01:05:28,638 --> 01:05:29,800
You serve me...

551
01:05:30,015 --> 01:05:34,308
...and the manner in which
you serve me reflects upon me!

552
01:05:35,353 --> 01:05:38,971
I would've thought that a gentleman
from a family as esteemed as yours...

553
01:05:39,190 --> 01:05:40,565
...would understand that.

554
01:05:42,569 --> 01:05:45,486
My late father squandered any esteem
in which we were held...

555
01:05:45,697 --> 01:05:47,570
...along with my inheritance.

556
01:05:50,994 --> 01:05:53,663
I advance myself
only through victory.

557
01:05:53,871 --> 01:05:57,204
You advance yourself
only through my good graces.

558
01:05:58,918 --> 01:06:00,957
These Colonials are our brethren.

559
01:06:01,212 --> 01:06:06,004
And when this conflict is over, we
will re-establish commerce with them.

560
01:06:06,509 --> 01:06:08,382
Do you understand, colonel?

561
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,427
Perfectly, my lord.

562
01:06:54,347 --> 01:06:57,431
Reverend, with your permission,
I'd like to make an announcement.

563
01:06:57,725 --> 01:07:00,761
Young man, this is a house of God.

564
01:07:01,395 --> 01:07:03,968
I understand that, reverend.
I apologize.

565
01:07:05,775 --> 01:07:08,859
The South Carolina Militia is
being called up.

566
01:07:09,195 --> 01:07:11,104
I'm here to enlist every man willing.

567
01:07:12,531 --> 01:07:13,360
Son...

568
01:07:14,074 --> 01:07:15,865
...we are here to pray...

569
01:07:16,118 --> 01:07:18,953
...for the souls of those men
hanging outside.

570
01:07:19,163 --> 01:07:21,036
Yes, pray for them.

571
01:07:21,290 --> 01:07:23,578
But honour them by
taking up arms with us.

572
01:07:25,419 --> 01:07:27,458
And bring more suffering
to this town?

573
01:07:27,838 --> 01:07:31,503
If King George can hang those men,
he can hang any one of us.

574
01:07:33,552 --> 01:07:34,714
Dan Scott...

575
01:07:34,928 --> 01:07:38,379
...barely a week ago you railed
for two hours about independence.

576
01:07:41,226 --> 01:07:43,598
Mr. Hardwick, how many times
have I heard you...

577
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:46,557
...speak of freedom
at my father's table?

578
01:07:48,107 --> 01:07:51,440
Half the men in this church,
including you, Father...

579
01:07:52,695 --> 01:07:54,486
...and you, reverend...

580
01:07:54,947 --> 01:07:57,900
...are as ardent patriots as I.

581
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:07,040
Will you now, when you are needed
most, stop at only words?

582
01:08:07,543 --> 01:08:09,334
Is that the sort of men you are?

583
01:08:18,971 --> 01:08:21,129
I ask only that you act
upon the beliefs...

584
01:08:21,473 --> 01:08:24,260
...of which you have
so strongly spoken...

585
01:08:25,227 --> 01:08:28,311
...and in which you
so strongly believe.

586
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:41,943
Who's with us?

587
01:09:43,803 --> 01:09:44,798
Mr. Howard.

588
01:09:46,014 --> 01:09:47,009
Sir...

589
01:09:47,515 --> 01:09:49,721
...may I have permission to
write to Anne?

590
01:09:53,563 --> 01:09:56,729
- May I have permission to write Anne?
- Yes.

591
01:09:57,734 --> 01:09:59,144
You have permission...

592
01:09:59,610 --> 01:10:01,567
...to write me.

593
01:10:02,029 --> 01:10:03,902
Oh, write her.

594
01:10:05,408 --> 01:10:06,736
Very well.

595
01:10:08,786 --> 01:10:09,948
Thank you, sir.

596
01:10:12,498 --> 01:10:13,742
Reverend?

597
01:10:20,631 --> 01:10:22,753
A shepherd must tend his flock.

598
01:10:24,051 --> 01:10:27,301
And, at times, fight off the wolves.

599
01:11:06,175 --> 01:11:09,425
Are you sure this is the right place
to recruit for a militia?

600
01:11:16,852 --> 01:11:18,394
God save King George!

601
01:11:38,165 --> 01:11:40,122
I think we came to the right place.

602
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:49,627
- Any bounty?
- No scalp money this time, Rollins.

603
01:11:49,884 --> 01:11:54,130
But you can keep or sell me the muskets
and gear of any Redcoat you kill.

604
01:12:06,192 --> 01:12:08,729
They hanged my brother
down in Acworth.

605
01:12:09,487 --> 01:12:12,156
Every damned one of them Redcoats
deserves to die.

606
01:12:12,406 --> 01:12:13,983
- Sign up.
- With all my ailments...

607
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:17,200
...I wouldn't make it through
the first skirmish. No, sir.

608
01:12:17,411 --> 01:12:20,328
But you can have my Negro.
He'll fight in my stead.

609
01:12:20,539 --> 01:12:21,997
Occam! Get over here.

610
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:26,999
Ain't overly smart.
He's strong as a bull.

611
01:12:27,212 --> 01:12:28,243
Can you write?

612
01:12:29,298 --> 01:12:31,124
No, no, sir.

613
01:12:31,383 --> 01:12:33,090
- Well, then, make your mark.
- Why?

614
01:12:33,468 --> 01:12:35,259
I just signed him over to you.

615
01:12:35,512 --> 01:12:37,634
If you're willing, make your mark.

616
01:12:44,479 --> 01:12:45,474
That'll do.

617
01:12:51,027 --> 01:12:52,569
I'll kill me some Redcoats.

618
01:12:53,488 --> 01:12:54,816
I believe you would.

619
01:12:55,198 --> 01:12:56,360
How old are you?

620
01:12:56,616 --> 01:12:59,153
Not quite old enough.
But his time will come.

621
01:12:59,410 --> 01:13:01,865
John Billings.
I was hoping you'd turn up.

622
01:13:02,121 --> 01:13:04,576
There's a story going around
about 20 Redcoats...

623
01:13:04,749 --> 01:13:07,500
...got killed by a ghost
or some damn thing.

624
01:13:07,710 --> 01:13:09,334
Carried a Cherokee tomahawk.

625
01:13:11,464 --> 01:13:14,464
Aren't you a little old to be
believing in ghost stories?

626
01:14:20,698 --> 01:14:22,322
How many did you get?

627
01:14:22,825 --> 01:14:23,820
Twelve.

628
01:14:24,618 --> 01:14:25,613
Good.

629
01:14:26,703 --> 01:14:29,538
These men,
they're not the sort we need.

630
01:14:32,834 --> 01:14:34,956
They're exactly the sort we need.

631
01:14:36,171 --> 01:14:38,293
They've fought
this kind of war before.

632
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:43,801
What about me?
Am I one of that sort?

633
01:14:44,512 --> 01:14:45,756
Hell, no.

634
01:14:46,306 --> 01:14:48,345
Your sort gives that sort a bad name.

635
01:14:54,105 --> 01:14:57,355
I want accuracy and precision.

636
01:14:57,859 --> 01:14:59,021
Make ready!

637
01:15:03,865 --> 01:15:05,323
Take aim!

638
01:15:10,496 --> 01:15:11,824
Fire!

639
01:15:51,327 --> 01:15:52,571
Dear Anne:

640
01:15:52,871 --> 01:15:54,910
Our force continues to grow.

641
01:15:55,123 --> 01:15:59,583
As long as we continue to fight,
others will come to fight beside us.

642
01:15:59,794 --> 01:16:02,794
I long to see you and speak to you.

643
01:16:03,047 --> 01:16:05,584
I'm hopeful that our duties
will bring me near you.

644
01:16:05,842 --> 01:16:10,135
Until then, I am and will remain
most affectionately yours.

645
01:16:10,346 --> 01:16:11,341
Gabriel.

646
01:16:37,789 --> 01:16:39,331
We surrender!

647
01:16:41,543 --> 01:16:42,918
No! God, stop!

648
01:16:43,128 --> 01:16:44,586
For the love of God, we...

649
01:16:45,797 --> 01:16:47,421
These men were about to surrender!

650
01:16:49,467 --> 01:16:50,795
Perhaps.

651
01:16:51,010 --> 01:16:52,041
We will never know.

652
01:16:52,554 --> 01:16:53,549
This is murder!

653
01:16:54,138 --> 01:16:57,257
Hell, reverend, they're Redcoats.
They've earned it.

654
01:17:00,019 --> 01:17:02,474
- We're better than that.
- What do you know about war?

655
01:17:02,688 --> 01:17:04,561
I know the difference
between fighting...

656
01:17:04,816 --> 01:17:06,440
Go back to church!

657
01:17:06,651 --> 01:17:07,931
Quiet!

658
01:17:09,779 --> 01:17:11,107
He's right.

659
01:17:11,864 --> 01:17:15,446
Quarter will be given to British
wounded and any who surrender.

660
01:17:15,659 --> 01:17:19,407
They gave no quarter when they fired on
a ship carrying my wife and daughters.

661
01:17:20,456 --> 01:17:23,789
I watched from 200 yards off
as they were burned alive.

662
01:17:24,376 --> 01:17:27,376
- All my sympathy, but my order stands.
- Damn your sympathy.

663
01:17:28,172 --> 01:17:30,378
Who are you to give such an order?

664
01:17:31,258 --> 01:17:34,342
I know what you did
to my countrymen at Fort Wilderness.

665
01:17:36,888 --> 01:17:40,303
We're militia.
This is not regular army.

666
01:17:41,393 --> 01:17:43,848
Every man here is free to
come and go as he pleases.

667
01:17:44,104 --> 01:17:45,218
But while you're here...

668
01:17:45,605 --> 01:17:48,060
...you will obey my command
or I will have you shot.

669
01:17:53,988 --> 01:17:56,027
- Damn dogs!
- Shoot the damn things!

670
01:17:56,282 --> 01:17:59,366
- Stay that pistol.
- They won't let you near the wagon.

671
01:18:05,416 --> 01:18:07,788
- Rum, Madeira.
- No wonder they were guarding it.

672
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:09,204
Officers' uniforms.

673
01:18:09,462 --> 01:18:11,288
What you think all this is worth?

674
01:18:12,798 --> 01:18:16,131
It's the personal correspondence
of Lord Cornwallis.

675
01:18:18,471 --> 01:18:19,466
This is his journal.

676
01:18:20,973 --> 01:18:24,840
I say we drink the wine, eat the dogs
and use the papers for musket wadding.

677
01:18:25,311 --> 01:18:26,639
Eat the dogs?

678
01:18:27,813 --> 01:18:29,604
Dog is a fine meal.

679
01:18:30,774 --> 01:18:32,149
Good heavens.

680
01:18:45,330 --> 01:18:47,287
I have some maps here for you.

681
01:18:48,667 --> 01:18:51,204
Put them down over there.
Thank you.

682
01:18:52,462 --> 01:18:54,750
Here. A proper musket for you.

683
01:18:55,006 --> 01:18:59,169
I don't know about you, but I don't like
the idea giving muskets to slaves.

684
01:19:01,846 --> 01:19:04,134
Your sense of freedom is
as pale as your skin.

685
01:19:10,938 --> 01:19:12,645
Don't listen to them.

686
01:19:14,775 --> 01:19:17,312
If we win this war,
a lot of things will change.

687
01:19:18,237 --> 01:19:19,779
What will change?

688
01:19:21,156 --> 01:19:25,817
They call this the New World.
It's not. It's the same as the old.

689
01:19:28,455 --> 01:19:30,992
But we'll have a chance
to build a new world.

690
01:19:34,127 --> 01:19:38,587
A world where all men are
created equal under God.

691
01:19:39,383 --> 01:19:40,627
Equal.

692
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:43,669
Sounds good.

693
01:19:44,846 --> 01:19:47,218
I've just been in the mind
of a genius.

694
01:19:49,976 --> 01:19:54,518
Cornwallis knows more about warfare
than we could learn in a dozen lifetimes.

695
01:19:55,106 --> 01:19:56,434
That's cheerful news.

696
01:19:56,900 --> 01:20:01,193
His victories at Camden and
Charles Town were perfect. Perfect.

697
01:20:02,155 --> 01:20:04,112
And he knows it, what's more.

698
01:20:06,492 --> 01:20:07,867
Perhaps that's his weakness.

699
01:20:08,369 --> 01:20:09,531
Sir?

700
01:20:10,830 --> 01:20:11,992
Pride.

701
01:20:13,207 --> 01:20:14,617
Pride's a weakness.

702
01:20:15,167 --> 01:20:17,704
Personally, I would prefer stupidity.

703
01:20:20,005 --> 01:20:21,333
Pride will do.

704
01:20:32,559 --> 01:20:34,350
Finished, my lord.

705
01:20:34,853 --> 01:20:36,810
I've taken it in at the back...

706
01:20:37,064 --> 01:20:39,768
...added wider epaulets
and looped gold braiding.

707
01:20:39,983 --> 01:20:42,770
- It's a horse blanket.
- I don't know, my lord.

708
01:20:43,278 --> 01:20:45,603
It's really quite nice.

709
01:20:45,947 --> 01:20:48,734
- Very nice, my lord.
- Very well. It's a nice horse blanket.

710
01:20:50,493 --> 01:20:53,410
Colonel Tavington,
why, after six weeks...

711
01:20:53,621 --> 01:20:56,705
...am I still attending a ball
in South Carolina...

712
01:20:56,958 --> 01:20:59,662
...when I should be attending balls
in North Carolina?

713
01:20:59,836 --> 01:21:01,246
First, the theft of my baggage...

714
01:21:01,671 --> 01:21:04,375
...including my memoirs,
on which I spent countless hours.

715
01:21:04,966 --> 01:21:08,465
Then half the bridges and ferries
between here and Charles Town burned.

716
01:21:08,970 --> 01:21:11,674
If you can't protect our supply lines
against militia...

717
01:21:12,056 --> 01:21:15,471
...how do you intend doing so against
the Regulars or the French?

718
01:21:15,685 --> 01:21:18,306
They won't fight like Regulars.
We can't find them.

719
01:21:18,521 --> 01:21:20,976
Colonel, they're militia.

720
01:21:21,649 --> 01:21:23,937
They're farmers with pitchforks!

721
01:21:24,777 --> 01:21:27,232
They're rather more than that,
I'm afraid.

722
01:21:27,529 --> 01:21:30,446
Made so by their commander,
this ghost.

723
01:21:30,699 --> 01:21:33,534
Oh, ghost, ghost, ghost.

724
01:21:34,119 --> 01:21:36,692
You created this ghost, colonel.

725
01:21:37,539 --> 01:21:39,330
Your brutality swelled his ranks.

726
01:21:39,583 --> 01:21:41,871
Without them this ghost
would've disappeared...

727
01:21:41,918 --> 01:21:44,455
...and I'd be
in North Carolina by now!

728
01:21:44,713 --> 01:21:45,957
In my defence, my lord...

729
01:21:46,089 --> 01:21:48,046
Oh, enough, enough!

730
01:21:48,758 --> 01:21:53,004
A fine soldier you are,
bested by a bedtime story.

731
01:21:54,347 --> 01:21:56,304
Give me the horse blanket.

732
01:21:59,519 --> 01:22:02,603
O'Hara, our supply ship appears
to have arrived.

733
01:22:03,231 --> 01:22:04,641
Yes, my lord, it has.

734
01:22:04,857 --> 01:22:07,312
Then why am I still wearing this rag?

735
01:22:07,527 --> 01:22:10,444
Your replacement wardrobe is
aboard ship, but...

736
01:22:10,655 --> 01:22:14,735
...Colonel Tavington thought it best to
secure our arms and munitions first.

737
01:22:14,909 --> 01:22:16,071
They are being unloaded.

738
01:22:27,796 --> 01:22:29,254
You look good in that colour.

739
01:22:31,383 --> 01:22:32,627
It stinks.

740
01:22:34,636 --> 01:22:36,427
Well, it's had a dead man in it.

741
01:22:36,805 --> 01:22:38,596
The beasts took your dogs too?

742
01:22:38,974 --> 01:22:40,218
Yes.

743
01:22:41,226 --> 01:22:44,392
Fine animals.
A gift from His Majesty.

744
01:22:45,313 --> 01:22:46,855
Dead now, for all I know.

745
01:22:47,315 --> 01:22:49,521
Is there no decency?

746
01:22:58,785 --> 01:23:02,533
Oh, fireworks. Lovely!

747
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:36,070
Mr. Howard.

748
01:23:37,030 --> 01:23:39,152
I've come to call on Anne.

749
01:23:44,955 --> 01:23:48,039
I've come to call on Anne!

750
01:23:48,291 --> 01:23:50,497
Well, of course you
call yourself a man.

751
01:23:51,503 --> 01:23:54,836
Father, stop it. You heard him.

752
01:23:57,383 --> 01:23:58,378
Well...

753
01:23:59,093 --> 01:24:00,587
...call on her.

754
01:24:26,370 --> 01:24:27,698
I'm nearly finished.

755
01:24:29,456 --> 01:24:31,247
You needn't worry, Father.

756
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:32,910
Yeah, I know.

757
01:24:33,502 --> 01:24:37,333
Bundling bags are a wonderful
tradition. I don't mind in the least.

758
01:24:39,132 --> 01:24:40,674
Be still.

759
01:24:41,259 --> 01:24:42,290
Tea?

760
01:24:43,345 --> 01:24:44,673
Please.

761
01:24:46,473 --> 01:24:47,504
There.

762
01:24:56,066 --> 01:24:57,310
Come, dear.

763
01:25:08,870 --> 01:25:10,328
It's very good.

764
01:25:13,332 --> 01:25:15,538
I'm pleased that you like it.

765
01:25:24,385 --> 01:25:25,547
Peter.

766
01:25:26,303 --> 01:25:29,885
Don't worry. I sew better
than my mother did.

767
01:25:32,976 --> 01:25:34,434
I hope so.

768
01:25:40,692 --> 01:25:42,731
If you're just gonna stand there...

769
01:25:43,028 --> 01:25:44,735
...why don't you read it for us?

770
01:25:44,863 --> 01:25:46,570
I can't read.

771
01:25:49,367 --> 01:25:50,611
I can.

772
01:25:53,872 --> 01:25:54,867
"Take notice.

773
01:25:55,790 --> 01:25:59,289
By order of General Washington
and the Continental Congress...

774
01:25:59,461 --> 01:26:02,580
...all bound slaves who give
minimum one year service...

775
01:26:03,006 --> 01:26:04,500
...in the Continental Army...

776
01:26:05,341 --> 01:26:07,380
...will be granted freedom...

777
01:26:08,052 --> 01:26:11,800
...and be paid a bounty of five
shillings for each month of service."

778
01:26:12,306 --> 01:26:13,681
Did you hear that?

779
01:26:13,891 --> 01:26:16,132
First they'll free them,
then they'll pay them.

780
01:26:17,478 --> 01:26:19,684
Only another six months.

781
01:26:22,358 --> 01:26:24,149
What will you do with freedom?

782
01:26:35,579 --> 01:26:37,203
I made this for you.

783
01:26:53,597 --> 01:26:55,388
Look after your mother.

784
01:27:00,895 --> 01:27:02,389
You know, Peter...

785
01:27:03,064 --> 01:27:04,688
...I can't pay you for this.

786
01:27:04,899 --> 01:27:09,062
Benjamin, you pay me what you can,
when you can.

787
01:27:09,529 --> 01:27:10,939
I'm obliged.

788
01:27:12,281 --> 01:27:15,566
Gabriel sure reminds me a lot of you.

789
01:27:16,827 --> 01:27:19,033
No, no, he's more like his mother.

790
01:27:20,790 --> 01:27:22,034
Corporal!

791
01:27:23,584 --> 01:27:25,457
Take your time. Dogs.

792
01:27:42,686 --> 01:27:43,717
Sir.

793
01:28:30,149 --> 01:28:32,022
This road is closed.

794
01:28:32,443 --> 01:28:34,731
These wagons now belong to
the Continental Army.

795
01:28:35,195 --> 01:28:37,650
Ready arms!

796
01:28:50,460 --> 01:28:51,870
By twos!

797
01:29:00,887 --> 01:29:04,505
There's no need for your men to die.
Leave the wagons and go.

798
01:29:05,058 --> 01:29:06,765
This is the king's highway.

799
01:29:07,143 --> 01:29:09,894
And I advise you and your men
to make way.

800
01:29:16,819 --> 01:29:17,898
Charge!

801
01:29:18,946 --> 01:29:20,025
Fire!

802
01:29:21,365 --> 01:29:22,740
Retreat!

803
01:29:29,748 --> 01:29:31,123
Save yourselves!

804
01:29:59,277 --> 01:30:00,308
Retreat!

805
01:30:18,921 --> 01:30:21,162
Ambush! Ambush!

806
01:30:54,873 --> 01:30:56,497
I have the count.

807
01:30:57,959 --> 01:30:59,750
22 are dead.

808
01:31:00,503 --> 01:31:02,875
18 wounded and 20 are missing.

809
01:31:03,173 --> 01:31:04,501
I'm through.

810
01:31:10,513 --> 01:31:12,137
He won't be the last to leave.

811
01:31:12,849 --> 01:31:15,055
Trust me.
Soon my countrymen will arrive.

812
01:31:15,309 --> 01:31:17,266
- The French army is...
- To hell with you.

813
01:31:17,478 --> 01:31:19,055
And to hell with the French army.

814
01:31:19,272 --> 01:31:20,351
We don't need them.

815
01:31:20,606 --> 01:31:23,725
We got Benjamin Martin.
We know what he done to the French.

816
01:31:38,332 --> 01:31:39,707
Father.

817
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:44,579
Men always buy you drinks because
of what happened at Fort Wilderness.

818
01:31:47,090 --> 01:31:49,711
Strangers know more
about you than I do.

819
01:31:51,803 --> 01:31:53,427
Tell me what happened.

820
01:31:54,598 --> 01:31:59,176
Your mother asked me that question
around about the time you were born.

821
01:32:02,021 --> 01:32:04,725
I was drunk and foolish enough
to answer it.

822
01:32:11,364 --> 01:32:14,815
The French and the Cherokee
had raided along the Blue Ridge.

823
01:32:15,576 --> 01:32:18,660
The English settlers had sought refuge
at Fort Charles.

824
01:32:18,996 --> 01:32:22,115
By the time we got there,
the fort was abandoned.

825
01:32:23,626 --> 01:32:25,748
They'd left about a week before.

826
01:32:27,213 --> 01:32:29,750
But what we found was...

827
01:32:32,551 --> 01:32:33,795
Go on.

828
01:32:36,930 --> 01:32:40,429
They'd killed all the settlers,
the men.

829
01:32:42,477 --> 01:32:44,268
With the women and...

830
01:32:44,479 --> 01:32:46,685
...some of the children, they had...

831
01:32:49,776 --> 01:32:52,729
We buried them all,
what was left of them.

832
01:32:55,407 --> 01:32:58,111
We caught up with them
at Fort Wilderness.

833
01:33:01,204 --> 01:33:02,781
We took our time.

834
01:33:05,125 --> 01:33:07,995
We cut them apart slowly.

835
01:33:08,795 --> 01:33:10,502
Piece by piece.

836
01:33:15,843 --> 01:33:17,800
I can see their faces.

837
01:33:21,098 --> 01:33:23,304
I can still hear their screams.

838
01:33:25,436 --> 01:33:28,769
All but two. We let them live.

839
01:33:30,149 --> 01:33:32,271
We sent the heads on a pallet...

840
01:33:32,484 --> 01:33:35,105
...with the two that lived
back to Fort Ambercon.

841
01:33:35,863 --> 01:33:39,113
The eyes, tongues, fingers...

842
01:33:39,283 --> 01:33:41,275
...we put in baskets.

843
01:33:41,702 --> 01:33:44,489
Sent them down the Asheulot
to the Cherokee.

844
01:33:46,581 --> 01:33:50,115
Soon after, the Cherokee broke
their treaty with the French.

845
01:33:52,838 --> 01:33:54,913
That's how we justified it.

846
01:34:04,015 --> 01:34:05,343
We were...

847
01:34:07,018 --> 01:34:08,393
...heroes.

848
01:34:10,813 --> 01:34:12,935
And men bought you drinks.

849
01:34:17,695 --> 01:34:21,692
Not a day goes by where I don't ask
God's forgiveness for what I did.

850
01:34:29,874 --> 01:34:33,871
Thomas was my brother,
as well as your son.

851
01:34:34,211 --> 01:34:38,125
You may not believe this, but I want
satisfaction as much as you do.

852
01:34:40,175 --> 01:34:42,214
But not at the expense of our cause.

853
01:34:43,470 --> 01:34:46,007
There will be a time for revenge.

854
01:34:47,015 --> 01:34:49,470
But until then, stay the course.

855
01:34:51,603 --> 01:34:54,769
Your mother said that when
I'd get drunk or lose my temper.

856
01:34:55,023 --> 01:34:57,478
She'd say it to me
when I picked on Thomas.

857
01:35:03,531 --> 01:35:04,775
I miss him.

858
01:35:21,424 --> 01:35:24,508
The British got 18 of our men
at Fort Carolina.

859
01:35:24,969 --> 01:35:27,969
They'll be hung one at a time until
they give up the rest of us.

860
01:35:43,946 --> 01:35:45,190
Reverend...

861
01:35:45,447 --> 01:35:47,404
...can you write a letter for me?

862
01:35:47,950 --> 01:35:50,487
- To my wife and boy.
- Yes, of course I will.

863
01:35:50,660 --> 01:35:53,660
But first let us pray.

864
01:36:08,386 --> 01:36:09,417
My lord...

865
01:36:09,804 --> 01:36:11,511
...there is a rider at the gates.

866
01:36:11,889 --> 01:36:14,640
A civilian carrying a white flag.

867
01:36:15,018 --> 01:36:16,595
I am occupied.

868
01:36:17,103 --> 01:36:19,475
He has a pair of dogs with him.

869
01:36:20,148 --> 01:36:22,520
Great Danes.

870
01:36:23,484 --> 01:36:24,479
And dear Lord...

871
01:36:24,694 --> 01:36:26,982
...protect us in this,
our hour of need.

872
01:36:27,154 --> 01:36:30,902
This we ask in the name
of the Father, the Son...

873
01:36:31,117 --> 01:36:32,824
And the Holy Ghost.

874
01:36:37,998 --> 01:36:39,160
Wait here.

875
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:41,741
General Lord Cornwallis will be
with you shortly.

876
01:37:25,336 --> 01:37:28,206
Jupiter, Mars. Come, boys.

877
01:37:31,133 --> 01:37:32,128
Come.

878
01:37:35,638 --> 01:37:39,552
My good boys. My brave boys.
You seem to be well fed.

879
01:37:41,435 --> 01:37:43,012
I thank you for that.

880
01:37:43,228 --> 01:37:45,765
I'm afraid I don't know your name.

881
01:37:46,023 --> 01:37:50,234
I'm a colonel in the Continental Army.
My rank should be sufficient for now.

882
01:37:51,111 --> 01:37:52,569
As you wish.

883
01:37:53,405 --> 01:37:54,567
Please be seated.

884
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:55,771
Thank you.

885
01:37:57,743 --> 01:38:01,408
Would you, as the initiating officer,
care to begin?

886
01:38:02,039 --> 01:38:04,956
I will, unless you'd like to
claim aggrieved status.

887
01:38:05,167 --> 01:38:07,836
Yes, I would like to claim
aggrieved status.

888
01:38:08,045 --> 01:38:09,753
Very well, sir. Proceed.

889
01:38:10,089 --> 01:38:14,466
You have in your possession
belongings of mine including clothing...

890
01:38:14,761 --> 01:38:18,260
...furniture, personal effects
of a non-military nature...

891
01:38:18,974 --> 01:38:20,682
...which I'd like returned to me.

892
01:38:21,143 --> 01:38:23,894
Indeed. I will do so
as soon as possible.

893
01:38:25,481 --> 01:38:26,560
Thank you.

894
01:38:26,899 --> 01:38:30,065
Now we come to the matter
of the specific targeting...

895
01:38:30,194 --> 01:38:32,186
...of officers during engagements.

896
01:38:32,655 --> 01:38:35,821
You must know that in civilized
warfare, officers in the field...

897
01:38:36,034 --> 01:38:40,411
...must not be accorded inappropriate
levels of hostile attention.

898
01:38:41,415 --> 01:38:44,998
To your mind, what are appropriate
levels of hostile attention?

899
01:38:45,210 --> 01:38:47,498
Imagine the chaos that would follow...

900
01:38:47,755 --> 01:38:50,921
...from leaderless armies
having at each other.

901
01:38:51,384 --> 01:38:54,550
There must be gentlemen in command
to lead...

902
01:38:54,804 --> 01:38:58,137
...and, where necessary,
restrain their men.

903
01:38:59,142 --> 01:39:03,270
Restrain them from, say, targeting
civilians. Women, children and such.

904
01:39:06,608 --> 01:39:07,722
That's a separate issue.

905
01:39:08,026 --> 01:39:09,817
No. I consider them linked.

906
01:39:10,654 --> 01:39:13,358
And as long as your soldiers
attack civilians...

907
01:39:13,574 --> 01:39:16,658
...I will order the shooting
of officers at every engagement.

908
01:39:19,205 --> 01:39:21,660
And my men are excellent marksmen.

909
01:39:25,921 --> 01:39:26,916
Very well.

910
01:39:27,547 --> 01:39:30,501
- Now, let us move on to...
- Prisoner exchange.

911
01:39:31,677 --> 01:39:32,672
Sir?

912
01:39:33,512 --> 01:39:36,845
You have 18 of my men.
I want them back.

913
01:39:43,690 --> 01:39:48,316
I do have 18 criminals
under sentence of death...

914
01:39:48,612 --> 01:39:51,067
...but I hold no prisoners of war.

915
01:39:51,532 --> 01:39:54,616
If that's your position,
18 of your officers will have to die.

916
01:39:54,868 --> 01:39:56,741
Nineteen, if you hang me
with my men.

917
01:39:57,163 --> 01:39:58,158
My officers?

918
01:39:58,414 --> 01:39:59,409
Sir.

919
01:40:07,006 --> 01:40:09,960
Top of the ridge, to your left.
Below the tree line.

920
01:40:23,107 --> 01:40:24,269
Their names and ranks?

921
01:40:24,609 --> 01:40:28,523
They refused to give names. There are
9 lieutenants, 5 captains, 3 majors...

922
01:40:28,780 --> 01:40:30,571
...and one fat colonel
who called me...

923
01:40:32,534 --> 01:40:34,242
...a cheeky fellow.

924
01:40:34,703 --> 01:40:37,407
This is not the conduct
of a gentleman.

925
01:40:37,706 --> 01:40:40,541
If the conduct of your officers is
the measure of a gentleman...

926
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:42,999
...I'll take that as a compliment.

927
01:40:45,047 --> 01:40:46,209
Get my men.

928
01:40:50,178 --> 01:40:52,929
- Arrange the exchange.
- My lord.

929
01:40:53,056 --> 01:40:54,336
Thank you, sir.

930
01:41:25,841 --> 01:41:27,465
Release the prisoners!

931
01:41:32,431 --> 01:41:34,554
- What is this?
- Prisoner exchange.

932
01:41:34,767 --> 01:41:36,344
He has 18 of our officers.

933
01:41:36,561 --> 01:41:38,434
Who is he? I recognize him.

934
01:41:38,938 --> 01:41:40,562
He's the commander of the militia.

935
01:41:42,067 --> 01:41:44,902
- Your ghost.
- Stay that sword, colonel!

936
01:41:45,195 --> 01:41:47,520
He rode in under a white flag
for formal parley.

937
01:41:47,865 --> 01:41:49,110
This is madness.

938
01:41:49,825 --> 01:41:51,948
If you harm him,
you condemn our officers.

939
01:41:53,537 --> 01:41:57,700
With respect, sir, he's killed as many
officers in the last two months.

940
01:41:58,042 --> 01:42:02,503
He has shown no aggression here.
Hence he cannot be touched.

941
01:42:02,839 --> 01:42:04,381
Has he not?

942
01:42:07,970 --> 01:42:08,965
You!

943
01:42:09,722 --> 01:42:12,676
So you're the ghost, are you?
I remember you!

944
01:42:12,892 --> 01:42:14,931
On that farm! That stupid little boy!

945
01:42:21,985 --> 01:42:23,360
Did he die?

946
01:42:27,491 --> 01:42:28,570
You know...

947
01:42:28,992 --> 01:42:31,661
...it's an ugly business,
doing one's duty.

948
01:42:31,870 --> 01:42:33,993
But just occasionally...

949
01:42:34,665 --> 01:42:36,289
...it's a real pleasure.

950
01:42:40,421 --> 01:42:43,256
Before this war is over,
I'm going to kill you.

951
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:48,380
Why wait?

952
01:42:57,731 --> 01:42:58,893
Soon.

953
01:43:31,935 --> 01:43:33,097
Move out!

954
01:43:37,816 --> 01:43:41,267
But I still think it's imperative
to push north.

955
01:43:44,448 --> 01:43:46,736
One of our captured officers, my lord.

956
01:43:51,664 --> 01:43:54,914
My reputation suffers
because of your incompetence!

957
01:43:55,168 --> 01:43:58,085
That man insults me!

958
01:43:58,964 --> 01:44:02,629
Quite impressive for a farmer with
a pitchfork, wouldn't you say?

959
01:44:09,850 --> 01:44:12,554
I want you to find that man.

960
01:44:13,271 --> 01:44:15,310
I want you to capture him.

961
01:44:16,733 --> 01:44:18,939
The man has
the loyalty of the people.

962
01:44:19,444 --> 01:44:21,816
They protect him. Protect his family.

963
01:44:22,030 --> 01:44:23,654
Protect the families of his men.

964
01:44:25,075 --> 01:44:27,032
I can capture him for you.

965
01:44:28,621 --> 01:44:32,453
But to do so requires the use
of tactics that are somewhat...

966
01:44:33,751 --> 01:44:35,957
What was the word
your lordship used?

967
01:44:37,839 --> 01:44:39,333
"Brutal," I think.

968
01:44:48,183 --> 01:44:49,178
Go on.

969
01:44:58,361 --> 01:45:00,899
I am prepared to do
what is necessary.

970
01:45:01,239 --> 01:45:05,700
I alone will assume the full mantle
of responsibility for my actions...

971
01:45:05,911 --> 01:45:08,034
...free of the chain of command...

972
01:45:08,246 --> 01:45:10,452
...rendering you blameless.

973
01:45:11,125 --> 01:45:12,500
However...

974
01:45:12,710 --> 01:45:14,501
...if I do this...

975
01:45:14,712 --> 01:45:18,626
...you and I both know that I can
never return to England with honour.

976
01:45:21,928 --> 01:45:25,676
What, I wonder, is to become of me?

977
01:45:33,273 --> 01:45:36,227
When this war is over here
in the Colonies...

978
01:45:36,694 --> 01:45:38,485
...the new aristocracy...

979
01:45:40,573 --> 01:45:42,364
...will be landowners.

980
01:45:49,708 --> 01:45:52,329
Tell me about Ohio.

981
01:45:57,966 --> 01:45:59,128
Make way.

982
01:46:00,261 --> 01:46:01,506
As you were.

983
01:46:04,640 --> 01:46:08,720
Wilkins. A plantation seven miles
from Wakefield, on the Santee...

984
01:46:08,937 --> 01:46:11,095
...east of Black Swamp.
Who lived there?

985
01:46:13,191 --> 01:46:14,685
Benjamin Martin.

986
01:46:14,901 --> 01:46:16,609
He's the ghost.

987
01:46:17,362 --> 01:46:18,772
What do you know about him?

988
01:46:18,989 --> 01:46:22,572
Hell, everything.
I could tell you the size of his boot.

989
01:46:23,494 --> 01:46:27,326
Does he have family?
Where would he hide his children?

990
01:46:36,132 --> 01:46:38,801
His wife's sister has a plantation.

991
01:46:39,261 --> 01:46:40,885
It's not far.

992
01:47:14,674 --> 01:47:17,840
Aunt Charlotte!
Wake up, someone's coming!

993
01:47:23,391 --> 01:47:25,015
Get the boys.

994
01:47:27,479 --> 01:47:30,100
Margaret, come quickly.

995
01:47:30,316 --> 01:47:33,103
- Let's go.
- Boys, come.

996
01:47:33,694 --> 01:47:34,524
Go.

997
01:47:39,367 --> 01:47:41,075
Stay close.

998
01:47:46,875 --> 01:47:48,285
This way.

999
01:48:04,769 --> 01:48:06,014
Follow me.

1000
01:48:09,441 --> 01:48:11,979
We'll go downstairs to the kitchen.

1001
01:48:18,117 --> 01:48:20,405
Margaret, quick!
Get down there! Fast!

1002
01:48:32,299 --> 01:48:34,338
Samuel, get down there fast!

1003
01:49:31,696 --> 01:49:33,653
Beneath the sill. There.

1004
01:49:36,242 --> 01:49:37,784
There's no one in the house.

1005
01:49:37,994 --> 01:49:39,452
They can't be far.

1006
01:49:39,871 --> 01:49:42,243
Search the outbuildings
and the woods, quickly.

1007
01:50:19,998 --> 01:50:21,871
Prepare to fire the house.

1008
01:50:22,667 --> 01:50:24,042
Go.

1009
01:50:43,773 --> 01:50:45,730
This one's head of the house slaves.

1010
01:50:50,948 --> 01:50:52,525
Where are they hiding?

1011
01:50:56,370 --> 01:50:58,742
Keep looking!
They're here somewhere!

1012
01:51:04,587 --> 01:51:06,211
- Gabriel.
- Where's Father?

1013
01:51:06,548 --> 01:51:08,256
Torch the house!

1014
01:51:25,902 --> 01:51:26,897
To horse!

1015
01:51:34,286 --> 01:51:35,994
Come on! It's all right.

1016
01:51:36,204 --> 01:51:38,077
Susan, come here.

1017
01:51:47,300 --> 01:51:48,462
Charlotte!

1018
01:52:04,318 --> 01:52:07,188
They won't stop looking for us.

1019
01:52:09,490 --> 01:52:11,613
You'll be safe where we're taking you.

1020
01:52:12,493 --> 01:52:15,031
Father said it was
a perfect place to hide.

1021
01:52:17,666 --> 01:52:19,160
How is he?

1022
01:52:24,423 --> 01:52:26,166
I don't know. I'm his son.

1023
01:52:26,467 --> 01:52:28,340
Where is Father?

1024
01:52:29,887 --> 01:52:31,464
Speaking for months now.

1025
01:52:31,681 --> 01:52:33,258
Speaking for months.

1026
01:52:33,474 --> 01:52:35,265
Why did he go?

1027
01:52:37,479 --> 01:52:41,311
He didn't want those mean men
to find you, so he led them away.

1028
01:52:41,566 --> 01:52:43,938
He'll come see you
as soon as he can.

1029
01:52:44,236 --> 01:52:46,857
I don't care. I hate him.

1030
01:52:48,616 --> 01:52:50,324
Susan, you don't hate him.

1031
01:52:50,493 --> 01:52:54,028
I hate him, and I hope
he never comes back.

1032
01:53:27,866 --> 01:53:29,739
It's the children.

1033
01:53:30,786 --> 01:53:31,781
Abigale!

1034
01:53:33,706 --> 01:53:35,248
You're alive!

1035
01:53:45,385 --> 01:53:49,217
I know it's not much,
but you can stay here with me.

1036
01:54:08,284 --> 01:54:10,739
It's beautiful.

1037
01:54:11,288 --> 01:54:12,865
Thank you.

1038
01:54:25,178 --> 01:54:29,010
She spoke. Susan talked to you?

1039
01:54:29,224 --> 01:54:30,848
In full sentences.

1040
01:54:31,101 --> 01:54:33,722
As if she'd been speaking all along.

1041
01:54:36,106 --> 01:54:37,897
Damn, I wasn't there for it.

1042
01:54:39,276 --> 01:54:40,355
What did she say?

1043
01:54:42,947 --> 01:54:44,738
She said...

1044
01:54:46,242 --> 01:54:49,362
...that she loves you
and misses you...

1045
01:54:49,787 --> 01:54:52,075
...but understands
why you can't be with her.

1046
01:54:55,460 --> 01:54:57,251
My Lord, she said that.

1047
01:54:57,963 --> 01:54:58,745
Isn't that something?

1048
01:55:03,218 --> 01:55:06,053
Tavington has a list of our men.
He's burning our homes...

1049
01:55:06,305 --> 01:55:08,131
...killing whomever resists.

1050
01:55:08,808 --> 01:55:12,224
- Where?
- Seven homes along the Santee so far.

1051
01:56:00,280 --> 01:56:02,153
John.

1052
01:56:10,958 --> 01:56:13,283
John, this is not a time
for vengeance.

1053
01:56:14,170 --> 01:56:16,743
This is a time for mourning.

1054
01:56:21,386 --> 01:56:23,129
John.

1055
01:56:31,897 --> 01:56:33,177
No!

1056
01:56:51,209 --> 01:56:52,952
Attend to your families.

1057
01:56:55,339 --> 01:56:57,627
One week furlough for all men.

1058
01:56:58,467 --> 01:57:02,761
Any man who does not return will not
be thought a coward or uncommitted.

1059
01:57:18,864 --> 01:57:20,192
Father!

1060
01:57:21,617 --> 01:57:23,325
Papa!

1061
01:57:29,375 --> 01:57:31,533
They're huge.
What have you been feeding them?

1062
01:57:31,711 --> 01:57:34,831
They're from good stock
on their father's side.

1063
01:57:43,515 --> 01:57:44,795
Susan?

1064
01:58:24,977 --> 01:58:28,346
I see it. There it is. Look.
Look, Father.

1065
01:58:30,441 --> 01:58:32,398
I got it! I got it!

1066
01:58:32,777 --> 01:58:33,808
You got it.

1067
01:58:34,612 --> 01:58:35,987
I got it!

1068
01:58:36,197 --> 01:58:37,276
- Careful.
- I caught it.

1069
01:58:37,490 --> 01:58:40,111
- All the fish are over here.
- Let's get them.

1070
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:48,873
Father, what changed you?

1071
01:58:51,296 --> 01:58:53,169
Are you sure I have?

1072
01:58:53,382 --> 01:58:56,336
Yes. You changed.

1073
01:59:03,810 --> 01:59:05,185
That's simple.

1074
01:59:05,895 --> 01:59:06,926
It was your mother.

1075
01:59:12,361 --> 01:59:15,278
A woman can have a strange effect
on a man.

1076
01:59:16,574 --> 01:59:18,198
There were times...

1077
01:59:18,868 --> 01:59:21,109
...I had trouble breathing
around your mother.

1078
01:59:22,330 --> 01:59:23,990
I know the feeling.

1079
01:59:26,084 --> 01:59:27,708
You once said...

1080
01:59:30,672 --> 01:59:33,210
...when I had a family of my own,
I'd understand.

1081
01:59:37,179 --> 01:59:38,721
You were right.

1082
01:59:41,308 --> 01:59:43,181
You're trying to tell me something.

1083
02:00:00,079 --> 02:00:01,454
- Apple?
- Thank you.

1084
02:00:08,463 --> 02:00:09,494
Congratulations.

1085
02:00:09,881 --> 02:00:11,541
Anne Patricia Howard...

1086
02:00:11,841 --> 02:00:15,969
...will you have this man to be
your husband to live in marriage?

1087
02:00:16,304 --> 02:00:18,877
Will you love, comfort
and honour him...

1088
02:00:19,099 --> 02:00:21,305
...for so long as you both shall live?

1089
02:00:21,894 --> 02:00:23,269
I will.

1090
02:00:23,687 --> 02:00:26,890
Gabriel Edward Martin, will you have
this woman to be your wife...

1091
02:00:27,108 --> 02:00:29,777
...to live together
in the covenant of marriage?

1092
02:00:30,153 --> 02:00:34,067
Will you love, comfort and honour her
as long as you both shall live?

1093
02:00:34,532 --> 02:00:35,563
I will.

1094
02:00:35,825 --> 02:00:38,660
Then by the power vested in me
by our mutual faith...

1095
02:00:38,912 --> 02:00:40,785
...in the Lord, our God...

1096
02:00:41,039 --> 02:00:44,324
...I now pronounce you man and wife.

1097
02:01:11,489 --> 02:01:13,730
I'm sorry we didn't give you
more warning.

1098
02:01:13,950 --> 02:01:14,981
It's fine.

1099
02:01:15,576 --> 02:01:16,986
I have something for you.

1100
02:01:19,747 --> 02:01:21,455
It belonged to Gabriel's mother.

1101
02:01:21,708 --> 02:01:23,416
It's beautiful.

1102
02:01:24,419 --> 02:01:25,617
Allow me.

1103
02:01:27,005 --> 02:01:28,463
It's the North Star.

1104
02:01:29,049 --> 02:01:32,632
That's the only star in the sky
that never moves.

1105
02:01:32,928 --> 02:01:35,964
It's constant, unwavering.

1106
02:01:36,474 --> 02:01:37,802
A guide.

1107
02:01:41,271 --> 02:01:42,895
I'd be honoured.

1108
02:01:48,153 --> 02:01:49,184
May I?

1109
02:01:49,404 --> 02:01:51,480
- If you must.
- I must.

1110
02:02:07,757 --> 02:02:09,251
May I sit with you?

1111
02:02:09,426 --> 02:02:11,502
It's a free country.

1112
02:02:12,262 --> 02:02:13,590
Or at least it will be.

1113
02:02:25,944 --> 02:02:28,020
I'm not my sister.

1114
02:02:29,072 --> 02:02:30,732
I know that.

1115
02:02:31,324 --> 02:02:32,901
Do you?

1116
02:02:34,202 --> 02:02:35,744
Yes, I do.

1117
02:02:36,788 --> 02:02:38,365
Very well, then.

1118
02:02:42,795 --> 02:02:43,826
Well?

1119
02:02:45,715 --> 02:02:46,960
Well what?

1120
02:03:09,198 --> 02:03:10,941
I'll see you in Pembroke soon.

1121
02:03:11,242 --> 02:03:12,985
Not soon enough.

1122
02:03:13,661 --> 02:03:15,570
I'm counting on you to make sure...

1123
02:03:15,789 --> 02:03:17,199
- I know.
- What?

1124
02:03:17,541 --> 02:03:21,076
- Say my prayers, take care of everyone.
- Couldn't have said it better.

1125
02:03:25,883 --> 02:03:26,914
Goodbye.

1126
02:03:27,510 --> 02:03:28,672
Goodbye.

1127
02:03:48,949 --> 02:03:50,194
Goodbye, Susan.

1128
02:03:52,662 --> 02:03:53,942
Goodbye?

1129
02:03:57,083 --> 02:03:58,743
Just one word, that's all I want.

1130
02:04:07,970 --> 02:04:09,049
All right.

1131
02:04:36,751 --> 02:04:38,161
Papa!

1132
02:04:40,838 --> 02:04:43,210
Papa, don't go! I'll say anything.

1133
02:04:47,929 --> 02:04:49,339
Please, Papa.

1134
02:04:51,767 --> 02:04:53,806
I'll say anything you want.

1135
02:04:54,019 --> 02:04:57,139
Tell me what you want me to say.
I'll say anything.

1136
02:05:00,026 --> 02:05:02,813
I promise, Papa. Please don't go.

1137
02:05:03,946 --> 02:05:05,274
I promise.

1138
02:05:06,157 --> 02:05:07,615
I'll come back.

1139
02:05:08,451 --> 02:05:10,490
I'll come back. You believe me?

1140
02:05:13,915 --> 02:05:15,991
You know, you make me very happy.

1141
02:05:51,956 --> 02:05:53,616
Just the three of us?

1142
02:05:54,167 --> 02:05:56,574
John Raskin did come by earlier.

1143
02:05:57,420 --> 02:05:59,329
He looked around, then he left.

1144
02:06:00,424 --> 02:06:01,752
He would've made four.

1145
02:06:02,259 --> 02:06:04,002
Four would have been better.

1146
02:06:39,299 --> 02:06:42,632
I got another two months to go
before I get to twelve months.

1147
02:06:48,058 --> 02:06:49,089
Colonel.

1148
02:06:50,269 --> 02:06:51,549
Reverend.

1149
02:06:55,066 --> 02:06:56,524
Trust the French.

1150
02:06:57,235 --> 02:06:58,515
Yes, trust the French.

1151
02:06:58,736 --> 02:07:02,319
Where else do I get the opportunity
to kill a few Redcoats?

1152
02:07:02,866 --> 02:07:06,069
Perhaps a few wounded ones
when you are not looking.

1153
02:07:32,689 --> 02:07:34,765
Everyone must gather at the church.

1154
02:07:35,401 --> 02:07:36,432
Mr. Wilkins?

1155
02:07:37,903 --> 02:07:41,023
Colonel Tavington wishes to address
the whole village.

1156
02:07:58,676 --> 02:08:02,804
This town has given aid to
Benjamin Martin and his rebels.

1157
02:08:03,389 --> 02:08:05,215
I wish to know his whereabouts.

1158
02:08:06,684 --> 02:08:08,012
So...

1159
02:08:08,144 --> 02:08:10,136
...anyone who comes forward...

1160
02:08:10,522 --> 02:08:12,680
...may be forgiven their treason.

1161
02:08:18,363 --> 02:08:19,394
Very well.

1162
02:08:19,615 --> 02:08:22,106
- You had your chance.
- Wait!

1163
02:08:23,244 --> 02:08:25,450
- This man gives them supplies.
- Quiet!

1164
02:08:25,663 --> 02:08:27,620
- He brings them to Black Swamp.
- Liar!

1165
02:08:27,832 --> 02:08:29,908
In the marsh,
by the old Spanish mission.

1166
02:08:30,919 --> 02:08:32,081
This man here?

1167
02:08:32,504 --> 02:08:34,461
- Yes.
- The Black Swamp, you say?

1168
02:08:34,839 --> 02:08:36,831
By the old Spanish mission.

1169
02:08:38,927 --> 02:08:40,337
Thank you very much.

1170
02:08:46,519 --> 02:08:48,061
Shut the doors.

1171
02:08:50,273 --> 02:08:52,230
But you said we'd be forgiven.

1172
02:08:52,442 --> 02:08:53,687
And indeed you may!

1173
02:08:56,446 --> 02:08:58,106
That's between you and God.

1174
02:09:05,331 --> 02:09:06,529
Be strong. We must.

1175
02:09:08,626 --> 02:09:10,334
I'll fire the town on your orders.

1176
02:09:10,503 --> 02:09:11,748
The town?

1177
02:09:12,630 --> 02:09:14,172
Burn the church.

1178
02:09:16,718 --> 02:09:18,461
There's no honour in this.

1179
02:09:20,805 --> 02:09:23,592
Didn't you say all those who stand
against England...

1180
02:09:23,809 --> 02:09:26,300
...deserve to die a traitor's death?

1181
02:09:28,981 --> 02:09:31,554
Burn the church, captain.

1182
02:09:43,788 --> 02:09:44,819
Give me the torch.

1183
02:10:27,877 --> 02:10:30,498
The honour is found in the end,
not the means.

1184
02:10:31,798 --> 02:10:33,506
This will be forgotten.

1185
02:10:34,134 --> 02:10:35,379
Bordon.

1186
02:12:15,034 --> 02:12:16,314
Anne!

1187
02:12:20,498 --> 02:12:22,158
Mrs. Howard?

1188
02:12:26,338 --> 02:12:28,081
Where is everybody?

1189
02:12:33,012 --> 02:12:35,088
They're not here.

1190
02:13:43,379 --> 02:13:44,921
Gabriel's gone.

1191
02:14:30,221 --> 02:14:32,593
To arms! To arms!

1192
02:18:52,252 --> 02:18:53,532
Father.

1193
02:18:54,963 --> 02:18:57,121
Just don't talk. Don't talk.

1194
02:19:03,598 --> 02:19:04,712
Father.

1195
02:19:05,099 --> 02:19:07,424
- I'm sorry.
- Be quiet.

1196
02:19:07,644 --> 02:19:09,767
I'll take care of you.
You'll be all right.

1197
02:19:12,816 --> 02:19:16,399
I'm sorry about Thomas.

1198
02:19:22,326 --> 02:19:24,651
Oh, son, that wasn't your fault.

1199
02:19:28,750 --> 02:19:29,995
That was mine.

1200
02:19:34,297 --> 02:19:37,417
Hold on. You're gonna be all right.

1201
02:19:40,220 --> 02:19:43,137
Don't go. Gabriel, don't.

1202
02:20:12,213 --> 02:20:14,501
Oh, God help me. God help me.

1203
02:20:48,585 --> 02:20:49,865
Where is he?

1204
02:20:57,720 --> 02:20:59,712
I'll help you bury him.

1205
02:21:01,891 --> 02:21:03,219
I'll bury him.

1206
02:21:06,480 --> 02:21:09,184
My wife in Alexandria is with child.

1207
02:21:10,734 --> 02:21:12,311
My first.

1208
02:21:13,070 --> 02:21:14,943
I fight for that child.

1209
02:21:17,533 --> 02:21:20,071
Benjamin, nothing will replace
your sons.

1210
02:21:21,412 --> 02:21:25,575
But if you come with us,
you can justify their sacrifice.

1211
02:21:27,419 --> 02:21:28,829
Why?

1212
02:21:30,589 --> 02:21:34,587
Why do men feel
they can justify death?

1213
02:21:41,183 --> 02:21:43,092
Is it arrogance or?

1214
02:21:47,774 --> 02:21:49,766
I have long feared...

1215
02:21:51,486 --> 02:21:55,021
...that my sins would return
to visit me.

1216
02:21:57,993 --> 02:22:00,614
And the cost is more than I can bear.

1217
02:22:01,956 --> 02:22:05,788
Benjamin, we have a chance.

1218
02:22:06,335 --> 02:22:09,538
Greene and Dan Morgan are
down from Virginia.

1219
02:22:12,258 --> 02:22:15,793
If we win this next battle, victory
in the war is within our grasp.

1220
02:22:15,929 --> 02:22:16,960
Go, then.

1221
02:22:17,306 --> 02:22:19,049
Seek your victory.

1222
02:22:22,478 --> 02:22:25,562
- I'm small issue to it.
- You're wrong, Benjamin.

1223
02:22:26,315 --> 02:22:28,307
You matter to your men...

1224
02:22:29,819 --> 02:22:31,562
...and to others as well.

1225
02:22:32,155 --> 02:22:33,946
Your victories...

1226
02:22:34,157 --> 02:22:36,030
...and your losses...

1227
02:22:37,327 --> 02:22:39,568
...are shared by more than you know.

1228
02:22:40,664 --> 02:22:42,822
Stay with us.

1229
02:22:43,333 --> 02:22:45,124
Stay the course.

1230
02:22:55,054 --> 02:22:57,177
I have run my course.

1231
02:23:17,203 --> 02:23:19,528
You men will be leaving with us.

1232
02:23:22,542 --> 02:23:24,084
Prepare the baggage.

1233
02:24:28,613 --> 02:24:29,644
Jean.

1234
02:25:28,177 --> 02:25:30,300
You will be missed tomorrow, colonel.

1235
02:25:30,638 --> 02:25:33,010
- Missed, my lord?
- Your wound.

1236
02:25:34,267 --> 02:25:36,639
It's nothing, my lord.

1237
02:25:36,978 --> 02:25:40,062
I am, as ever, ready to serve.

1238
02:25:40,232 --> 02:25:42,105
Very well.

1239
02:25:42,276 --> 02:25:44,683
Make sure you do.

1240
02:25:45,237 --> 02:25:48,653
I stand on the eve of the greatest
victory of my career. Don't fail me.

1241
02:25:49,617 --> 02:25:54,409
My efforts in no small measure
have brought you here.

1242
02:25:54,580 --> 02:25:56,204
I grant you that small measure...

1243
02:25:56,374 --> 02:25:59,873
...in spite of your failure
to deliver the ghost to me.

1244
02:26:00,879 --> 02:26:02,503
Thus far.

1245
02:26:03,757 --> 02:26:06,793
I will not tolerate
a premature charge...

1246
02:26:06,969 --> 02:26:10,801
...born of your eagerness for glory.

1247
02:26:11,223 --> 02:26:14,592
Wait for my order.

1248
02:26:14,977 --> 02:26:19,306
Or you may abandon
any hope of Ohio.

1249
02:26:22,777 --> 02:26:25,943
Tomorrow's battle can alter
the course of the war.

1250
02:26:26,156 --> 02:26:29,157
General Greene, what exactly is
the task before us?

1251
02:26:29,326 --> 02:26:32,446
Gentlemen,
Cornwallis has us cornered.

1252
02:26:33,122 --> 02:26:34,830
Not only does he outnumber us...

1253
02:26:35,040 --> 02:26:38,076
...but nearly half of our force
is militia.

1254
02:26:39,420 --> 02:26:41,708
Unreliable, at best.

1255
02:26:42,048 --> 02:26:43,874
Excuse me, sir.

1256
02:26:45,593 --> 02:26:47,336
You underestimate our militia.

1257
02:26:49,556 --> 02:26:50,931
All of you do.

1258
02:26:51,725 --> 02:26:54,346
We've seen our militia lines break
time and again.

1259
02:26:54,603 --> 02:26:56,227
Kips Bay, Princeton.

1260
02:26:56,438 --> 02:26:58,514
But the British have seen that too.

1261
02:26:59,567 --> 02:27:03,351
Cornwallis' own letters bear out that
he has no respect for the militia.

1262
02:27:04,113 --> 02:27:06,485
What are you suggesting, Ben?

1263
02:27:07,909 --> 02:27:09,818
I'm suggesting we use that.

1264
02:27:17,002 --> 02:27:21,000
I know you men have sacrificed
a lot so far.

1265
02:27:21,215 --> 02:27:24,584
But all I'm asking is that you...

1266
02:27:24,802 --> 02:27:27,968
...let the front line of the militia
fire two shots tomorrow.

1267
02:27:30,141 --> 02:27:33,225
A lot can happen in the time it takes
to fire two shots.

1268
02:27:33,520 --> 02:27:35,975
Especially against British Regulars.

1269
02:27:36,982 --> 02:27:40,730
Indeed. That's why I'm not asking you
to fire three.

1270
02:28:37,881 --> 02:28:40,253
If I die, I will die well dressed.

1271
02:29:26,474 --> 02:29:27,588
Fire!

1272
02:29:31,438 --> 02:29:34,308
- Battalion!
- Company, halt!

1273
02:29:51,418 --> 02:29:52,497
Harry...

1274
02:29:53,462 --> 02:29:55,419
...will you give this to my children?

1275
02:30:05,975 --> 02:30:07,137
Thank you.

1276
02:30:16,361 --> 02:30:18,069
It's October now.

1277
02:30:20,699 --> 02:30:21,861
I know.

1278
02:30:22,868 --> 02:30:24,777
It's more than 12 months.

1279
02:30:25,246 --> 02:30:26,526
You're a free man.

1280
02:30:27,707 --> 02:30:30,494
I'm here now on my own accord.

1281
02:30:34,339 --> 02:30:36,415
I'm honoured to have you with us.

1282
02:30:38,760 --> 02:30:40,005
Honoured.

1283
02:30:41,638 --> 02:30:44,176
Shoulder arms!

1284
02:30:49,897 --> 02:30:51,521
Forward...

1285
02:30:52,317 --> 02:30:53,597
...march!

1286
02:30:58,573 --> 02:31:00,364
How old were your daughters?

1287
02:31:02,452 --> 02:31:04,943
Violette was 12 and Pauline, 10.

1288
02:31:06,123 --> 02:31:08,080
They had green eyes.

1289
02:31:09,377 --> 02:31:11,120
I'm sure they were lovely.

1290
02:31:12,797 --> 02:31:14,588
Yes, they were.

1291
02:31:26,311 --> 02:31:27,509
- Battalion!
- Company!

1292
02:31:27,896 --> 02:31:29,058
March!

1293
02:31:31,275 --> 02:31:32,555
Fire!

1294
02:31:35,321 --> 02:31:36,566
Unless I'm dreaming...

1295
02:31:37,282 --> 02:31:41,114
...I believe I see militia forming
at their centre.

1296
02:31:55,676 --> 02:31:58,001
Battalion, halt!

1297
02:32:16,157 --> 02:32:17,983
Dress ranks!

1298
02:32:26,793 --> 02:32:28,287
Make ready!

1299
02:32:40,016 --> 02:32:41,842
Battalion!

1300
02:32:42,059 --> 02:32:43,090
Halt!

1301
02:32:46,189 --> 02:32:47,351
Take aim!

1302
02:32:50,861 --> 02:32:51,892
Fire!

1303
02:33:02,999 --> 02:33:04,078
Fire!

1304
02:33:25,106 --> 02:33:26,351
Hold the line!

1305
02:33:32,322 --> 02:33:35,572
- Prepare to charge!
- We haven't been given that order.

1306
02:33:35,825 --> 02:33:37,200
Charge!

1307
02:33:38,370 --> 02:33:39,449
Charge!

1308
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:44,375
Tavington.

1309
02:33:44,585 --> 02:33:46,791
Damn him! Damn that man!

1310
02:33:48,673 --> 02:33:50,167
Make ready.

1311
02:33:50,758 --> 02:33:52,252
Take aim!

1312
02:33:53,136 --> 02:33:54,167
Fire!

1313
02:33:55,472 --> 02:33:56,670
Take aim!

1314
02:33:57,724 --> 02:33:58,766
Fire!

1315
02:33:58,767 --> 02:34:00,047
Retreat!

1316
02:34:06,066 --> 02:34:10,110
Bayonet charge. We'll see who takes
the glory from this field.

1317
02:34:10,488 --> 02:34:12,065
Charge!

1318
02:34:31,969 --> 02:34:33,167
Congratulations, my lord.

1319
02:34:33,596 --> 02:34:35,220
Infantry reserve into the centre.

1320
02:34:35,264 --> 02:34:36,722
But you've taken the field.

1321
02:34:36,933 --> 02:34:38,308
Now we'll take their spirits.

1322
02:34:38,393 --> 02:34:41,513
Send the battalion over that hill
and crush them.

1323
02:34:41,771 --> 02:34:43,229
It ends today.

1324
02:35:06,506 --> 02:35:07,585
Hold the charge!

1325
02:35:08,633 --> 02:35:09,664
Fire!

1326
02:35:09,926 --> 02:35:12,214
Hold the charge!

1327
02:35:15,933 --> 02:35:17,343
Fire!

1328
02:35:22,899 --> 02:35:23,978
Take aim!

1329
02:35:25,652 --> 02:35:27,276
Fire!

1330
02:35:35,537 --> 02:35:37,079
Charge!

1331
02:35:43,921 --> 02:35:45,498
Charge bayonets!

1332
02:36:14,704 --> 02:36:15,866
Halt!

1333
02:36:17,082 --> 02:36:18,492
Hold! Dress your ranks!

1334
02:36:21,128 --> 02:36:22,326
Fire!

1335
02:36:25,800 --> 02:36:27,377
Charge!

1336
02:36:51,035 --> 02:36:52,695
Retreat!

1337
02:36:57,959 --> 02:36:59,038
Colonel!

1338
02:37:00,962 --> 02:37:02,290
The line is faltering!

1339
02:37:03,840 --> 02:37:06,331
Retreat! Retreat!

1340
02:37:14,227 --> 02:37:15,637
Wait!

1341
02:37:16,437 --> 02:37:18,180
No retreat!

1342
02:37:21,985 --> 02:37:24,191
Hold the line!

1343
02:37:25,822 --> 02:37:27,945
Hold the line!

1344
02:37:39,670 --> 02:37:42,706
Push forward, men!

1345
02:38:32,185 --> 02:38:34,473
Artillery, concentrate on the centre.

1346
02:38:49,704 --> 02:38:53,404
If we reform and wheel right,
we may be able to turn their flank.

1347
02:38:53,708 --> 02:38:55,617
You dream, general.

1348
02:41:58,156 --> 02:42:00,528
Kill me before the war is over,
will you?

1349
02:42:02,369 --> 02:42:05,038
It appears you are not...

1350
02:42:05,247 --> 02:42:07,453
...the better man.

1351
02:42:21,139 --> 02:42:22,170
You're right.

1352
02:42:26,979 --> 02:42:29,102
My sons were better men.

1353
02:42:56,844 --> 02:42:58,302
Sound the retreat.

1354
02:43:01,850 --> 02:43:03,308
Sound...

1355
02:43:04,436 --> 02:43:05,634
...retreat.

1356
02:43:23,665 --> 02:43:24,696
Dear Charlotte:

1357
02:43:25,458 --> 02:43:27,082
The war has turned.

1358
02:43:27,419 --> 02:43:30,918
General Cornwallis took flight
with his army and moved north.

1359
02:43:31,089 --> 02:43:34,292
We continued to engage the British,
and in the following months...

1360
02:43:34,385 --> 02:43:37,718
...Cornwallis entrenched himself
at Yorktown, Virginia.

1361
02:43:39,348 --> 02:43:41,506
Washington escaped from the north...

1362
02:43:41,684 --> 02:43:44,804
...and surrounded Cornwallis,
who could not retreat to the seas.

1363
02:43:45,271 --> 02:43:48,474
It was blocked off by
our long-lost friends...

1364
02:43:48,733 --> 02:43:51,058
...who had finally arrived.

1365
02:43:55,741 --> 02:43:57,151
Vive la France.

1366
02:43:59,870 --> 02:44:01,447
Vive la libert.

1367
02:44:13,635 --> 02:44:15,508
My lord, I beseech you.

1368
02:44:16,096 --> 02:44:18,384
You must order the surrender.

1369
02:44:19,224 --> 02:44:22,344
How could it come to this?
An army of rabble.

1370
02:44:23,062 --> 02:44:24,437
Peasants.

1371
02:44:26,524 --> 02:44:28,600
Everything will change.

1372
02:44:32,113 --> 02:44:34,105
Everything has changed.

1373
02:44:34,866 --> 02:44:36,942
Though he eventually surrendered...

1374
02:44:37,160 --> 02:44:39,615
...Cornwallis himself hid in shame...

1375
02:44:39,830 --> 02:44:43,413
...appointing his subordinate to
relinquish his sword.

1376
02:44:44,627 --> 02:44:47,747
With the war ending,
and our militia disbanding...

1377
02:44:47,964 --> 02:44:50,502
...I take measure of what
we have lost...

1378
02:44:50,842 --> 02:44:52,384
...and what we have won.

1379
02:44:53,553 --> 02:44:58,262
My hope and prayer is that
the sacrifices borne by so many...

1380
02:44:58,516 --> 02:45:02,348
...will spawn and fulfil the promise
of our new nation.

1381
02:45:03,772 --> 02:45:07,686
Tell the children, and especially
Susan, that I will keep my promise...

1382
02:45:07,902 --> 02:45:11,353
...as I will be returning
to you all soon.

1383
02:45:17,620 --> 02:45:19,328
Where will you go now?

1384
02:45:20,081 --> 02:45:22,322
Home. Start over.

1385
02:45:22,584 --> 02:45:24,909
Your wife's expecting a child,
isn't she?

1386
02:45:25,128 --> 02:45:27,879
She gave birth to a son
three weeks ago.

1387
02:45:29,049 --> 02:45:30,424
What'd you name him?

1388
02:45:32,511 --> 02:45:34,503
We named him Gabriel.

1389
02:45:40,103 --> 02:45:41,134
Thank you, Harry.

1390
02:45:48,362 --> 02:45:50,983
Gabriel is a good name for a farmer.

1391
02:45:51,573 --> 02:45:53,980
It is. It is.

1392
02:45:54,535 --> 02:45:55,649
Jean.

1393
02:45:55,911 --> 02:45:56,942
Ben.

1394
02:47:04,360 --> 02:47:07,064
Gabriel said if we won the war...

1395
02:47:07,447 --> 02:47:09,404
...we could build a whole new world.

1396
02:47:10,241 --> 02:47:13,195
Just figured we'd get started
right here...

1397
02:47:14,621 --> 02:47:16,329
...with your home.

1398
02:47:20,335 --> 02:47:21,710
Sounds good.

1399
02:47:25,174 --> 02:47:26,205
Thank you.

1400
02:47:31,014 --> 02:47:32,045
Ma'am.
