Yes, sir.

332

Fire the house and barns.

333
00:27:47,308 --> 00:27:49,610
Let it be known,
if you harbor the enemy,

334
00:27:49,677 --> 00:27:51,645
you will lose your home.

335
00:27:54,816 --> 00:27:56,984
By standing order of His
Majesty, King George,

336
00:27:57,051 --> 00:27:59,186
all slaves of the
American colonies

337
00:27:59,253 --> 00:28:02,556
who fight for the Crown
will be granted their freedom

338
00:28:02,623 --> 00:28:03,891
with our victory.

339
00:28:03,958 --> 00:28:05,026
Sir.

340
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,228
We're not slaves.

341
00:28:07,294 --> 00:28:09,831
We work this land.
We're freed men.

342
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:12,366
Well, then, you're freed men
who will have the opportunity

343
00:28:12,433 --> 00:28:16,237
and the privilege of fighting
in the king's army, aren't you?

Who carried this?

347
00:28:42,463 --> 00:28:43,831
I did, sir.

348
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:53,074
I was wounded. These
people gave me care.

349
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:56,043
They have nothing to do
with the dispatches.

350
00:28:58,545 --> 00:28:59,814
Take this one to Camden.

351
00:28:59,881 --> 00:29:02,649
He's a spy. Hang him,
put his body on display.

352
00:29:02,716 --> 00:29:05,052
He's a dispatch rider,
and that's a marked case.

353
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:06,587
Destroy the livestock.

354
00:29:06,653 --> 00:29:08,389
Save the horses
for the Dragoons.

355

Colonel,

356
00:29:09,757 --> 00:29:11,325
this is a uniformed

357
00:29:11,392 --> 00:29:12,894
carrying a marked case.

358
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,295
He cannot be held as a spy.

359
00:29:14,361 --> 00:29:16,097
Well, we're not going
to hold him.

360
00:29:16,163 --> 00:29:18,132
We're going to hang him.

361
00:29:20,601 --> 00:29:23,237
Colonel... (SOFTLY) Father!

362
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:27,441
Oh, I see.

363
00:29:27,508 --> 00:29:29,510
He's your son.

364
00:29:29,576 --> 00:29:33,247
Well, perhaps you should have
taught him something of loyalty.

365
00:29:33,314 --> 00:29:36,250
Colonel, I beg you,
please reconsider.

The rules of war?

367

Would you like a lesson,
sir, in the rules of war?

368
00:29:44,826 --> 00:29:47,128
Or perhaps your children would.

00:30:01,708 --> 00:30:03,044

Who's this? Sir, this
is Captain Wilkins.

He was with the
Loyalist Colonial Militia.

be of some use.

where do your loyalties lie?

To King and country, sir.

who'd betray his neighbors?

Captured over 5,000 of our

between him and New York.

marksman, scavenger.

Yes, sir.

I could be of better
service with the Regulars.

Where'd you learn all that
riding, shooting, scavenging?

647
00:54:35,581 --> 00:54:37,350
My father taught me.

648

649
00:54:41,621 --> 00:54:44,624
He tried.
It didn't take.

650
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:47,793
He also taught you every deer path and
swan trail between here and Charleston,

651
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:50,796
which is why I asked
for your transfer.

It skirts the mountain

towards the headwater here

Though, of course,
your service in this war

672

will be rewarded one day.

You may presume too much.

679

His Majesty, like history,

680
00:56:40,406 --> 00:56:42,274
judges us not only
by the outcome of the war

681

in which it was fought.

We serve the crown,

ourselves accordingly.

Is it not enough, my Lord, that
I have never lost a battle?

687
00:56:57,189 --> 00:57:02,027
You serve me, and the manner in which
you serve me reflects upon me!

00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:05,631
I would've thought
that a gentleman

689
00:57:05,698 --> 00:57:09,268
from a family as esteemed as
yours would understand that.

we will reestablish

he's killed as many officers

He has shown no aggression here.

It is. It is.

Gabriel said if we won the war,

1812
02:36:54,981 --> 02:36:57,917
we could build

Just figured we'd
get started right here.

Sounds good.
