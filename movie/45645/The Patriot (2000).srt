1
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,831
<i>I have long feared...</i>

2
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,070
<i>...that my sins would return
to visit me.</i>

3
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,999
<i>And the cost is more than I can bear.</i>

4
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,831
SamueI! A postrider!

5
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,470
An " R."

6
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,795
Good.

7
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,709
What about this one?

8
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,471
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

9
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,589
Father! Father!

10
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,708
Nine pounds, eleven ounces.
That's perfect. Perfect.

11
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,117
Father, a postrider!

12
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,313
Did you finish planting
the field?

13
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,675
More than half.

14
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,077
Those swimming breaks really cut
into the day, don't they?

15
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,519
Told you.

16
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,748
Thomas.

17
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,399
Wait for Father.

18
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,830
Sorry.

19
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,389
That's her. The North Star.

20
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,669
See?

21
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,151
You start from the front two stars
of the Big Dipper.

22
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,113
And then you count up.

23
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,472
You count up five finger lengths...

24
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,319
...and it's right there.

25
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,239
And she'll always be
looking down on us.

26
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,552
And protect us. Forever.

27
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,959
Come. Into bed.

28
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,629
Good night. Good night, Meg.

29
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,879
It helps her to know Mother's there.

30
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,315
Good night.

31
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,477
So what was in the maiI?

32
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,036
Peter Cuppin joined the Continentals.

33
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,510
He's 17, a year younger than I.

34
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,679
Well, the assembly's been convened,
so I've been called to Charles Town.

35
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,950
- We're going to Charles Town?
- We are.

36
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,388
We leave in the morning.

37
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,159
Aunt Charlotte!

38
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,152
Margaret, William, look at you.

39
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,553
Missed you.

40
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,828
They're huge.
What have you been feeding them?

41
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,956
Well, they're from good stock.
On their mother's side, of course.

42
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,396
Thank you. Come inside.
Wait untiI you see what I have.

43
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,955
- Presents? Presents for us?
- Move slowly.

44
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,549
Keep an eye on these heathens,
will you?

45
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,875
Sorry.

46
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,599
I have this for you, Susan.
It belonged to your mother.

47
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,511
She's still not talking?

48
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,875
No.

49
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,752
It does me good to see you.

50
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,073
Look, there's GabrieI.

51
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,118
Hang King George!

52
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,152
- Hang them all!
- Hang the lot of them!

53
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,916
My name is Peter Howard.

54
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,836
I lost most of my hearing
and my left leg...

55
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,556
...fighting for the Crown
in the French and Indian War.

56
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,834
And how did King George reward me?

57
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,714
He cuts off my other leg
with his taxes.

58
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,918
Miss Howard, isn't it?

59
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,951
You know who I am, GabrieI Martin.

60
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,239
The last time you saw me,
I was 11 and you put ink in my tea.

61
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,153
I believe that was one of my younger
brothers. Perhaps SamueI or Nathan.

62
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,599
It was you, and it turned
my teeth black for a month.

63
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,636
- and send a message to King George
he will never forget!

64
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,119
Our first order of business-

65
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,157
And our last, if we vote a levy!

66
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,709
Order, order!

67
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,876
Mr. Simms, you do not have the floor.

68
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,073
First, an address by ColoneI
Harry Burwell of the ContinentaI Army.

69
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,599
ColoneI Burwell.

70
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,316
You all know why I'm here.

71
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,512
I'm not an orator.

72
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,239
And I would not try to convince you
of the worthiness of our cause.

73
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,999
I'm a soldier.

74
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,876
And we are at war.

75
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,870
From Philadelphia, we expect
a declaration of independence.

76
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,995
8 of the 13 colonies have
levied money...

77
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,236
...in support of a continentaI army.

78
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,955
I ask that South Carolina be the ninth.

79
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,552
Massachusetts and Virginia
may be at war...

80
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,836
...but South Carolina is not!

81
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,029
Hear, hear.

82
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,199
This is not a war for the independence
of one or two colonies...

83
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,670
...but for the independence
of one nation.

84
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,836
And what nation is that?

85
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,156
An American nation!

86
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,874
There is no such nation
and to speak of one is treason.

87
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,878
We are citizens of an American nation.

88
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,594
And our rights are being threatened...

89
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,268
...by a tyrant 3000 miles away.

90
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,875
Would you tell me, please,
Mr. Howard...

91
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,789
...why should I trade one tyrant
3000 miles away...

92
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,753
...for 3000 tyrants one mile away?

93
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,672
An elected legislature can trample
a man's rights as easily as a king can.

94
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,109
Captain Martin...

95
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,198
...I understood you to be a patriot.

96
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,116
If you mean by " patriot," am I angry
about taxation without representation?

97
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,594
Well, yes, I am.

98
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,792
Should the American colonies govern
themselves independently?

99
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,839
I believe they can. And they should.

100
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,110
But if you're asking me am I willing
to go to war with England...

101
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,880
...then the answer is
most definitely no.

102
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,193
This from the same Captain Benjamin
Martin whose fury was so famous...

103
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,477
...during the Wilderness campaign?

104
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,512
I was intemperate in my youth.

105
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,517
Temperance can be a disguise for fear.

106
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,033
Mr. Middleton, I fought
with Captain Martin...

107
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,879
...under Washington
in the French and Indian War.

108
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,993
There's not a man in this room...

109
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,239
...or anywhere for that matter, to whom
I would more willingly trust my life.

110
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,316
There are alternatives to war.

111
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,437
We take our case before the king.

112
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,039
- We plead with him.
- We tried.

113
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,596
Well, then, we try again and again
if necessary to avoid a war.

114
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,511
I was at Bunker Hill.

115
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,311
The British advanced three times.

116
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,394
We killed 700 at point-blank range
and still they took the ground.

117
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,553
That is the measure of their resolve.

118
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,750
If your principles dictate
independence...

119
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,155
...then war is the only way.

120
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,153
It is come to that.

121
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,793
Hear, hear.

122
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,672
I have seven children.

123
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,873
My wife is dead.

124
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,710
Now, who's to care for them
if I go to war?

125
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,271
Wars are not fought
only by childIess men.

126
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,068
Granted.

127
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,717
But mark my words.

128
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,635
This war will be fought,
not on the frontier...

129
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,513
...or on some distant battlefield...

130
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,078
...but amongst us.

131
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,157
Among our homes.

132
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,152
Our children will learn of it
with their own eyes.

133
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,799
And the innocent will die
with the rest of us.

134
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,153
I will not fight.

135
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,833
And because I will not fight,
I will not cast a vote...

136
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,679
...that will send others to fight
in my stead.

137
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,751
And your principles?

138
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,192
I'm a parent. I haven't got
the luxury of principles.

139
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,552
We must vote to levy!

140
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,869
28 to 12! The levy passed!

141
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,631
You intend to enlist
without my permission?

142
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,599
Yes, I do.

143
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,834
Father, I thought you were
a man of principle.

144
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,877
When you have a family of your own,
perhaps you'll understand.

145
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,472
When I have a family of my own,
I won't hide behind them.

146
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,749
He's as imprudent as his father was
at his age.

147
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,678
Regrettably so.

148
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,994
I'll see to it that he
serves under me.

149
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,993
Make him a clerk or quartermaster,
something of that sort.

150
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,879
Good luck.

151
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,115
<i>Dear Thomas.;
Though many seasons have passed...</i>

152
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:09,393
<i>...it seems like only yesterday when
we last saw each other in Charles Town.</i>

153
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,032
<i>With sadness, I learned
of its recent fall to the British...</i>

154
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,992
<i>...under General Cornwallis.</i>

155
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,752
<i>I received a letter
from Aunt Charlotte...</i>

156
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,872
<i>...saying she closed her home
in Charles Town after the city fell...</i>

157
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,198
<i>...and moved to her plantation
on the Santee.</i>

158
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,551
<i>Here in the north, our campaign has
been marked by defeat and privation.</i>

159
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,230
<i>Our losses have been grievous.</i>

160
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,313
<i>My good friend, Peter Cuppin,
fell at E lizabethtown.</i>

161
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,394
<i>His death has been difficult to bear.</i>

162
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,149
<i>We will march south
with General Gates...</i>

163
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,033
<i>...to fight the Redcoats
under Cornwallis.</i>

164
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,029
Thank you, sir.

165
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,112
Easy, Red. Easy.

166
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,833
<i>I envy you...</i>

167
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,352
<i>...your youth and distance from this
cruel conflict of which I am a part.</i>

168
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,393
" But I am fortunate to be
serving the cause of Liberty.

169
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,671
And though I fear death...

170
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,480
...each day in prayer I reaffirm
my willingness...

171
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,910
...to give my life in its service.

172
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,915
Pray for me.

173
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,675
But above all, pray for the cause.

174
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,557
Your loving brother, GabrieI."

175
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,355
What are you doing?

176
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,068
Turn around.

177
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,791
Not yet, Thomas.

178
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,195
When?

179
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,115
Seventeen.

180
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,279
That's two years.
It's already been two.

181
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,398
- The war could be over by then.
- God willing.

182
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,080
All right. Seventeen.

183
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,549
All right.

184
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,193
Put it back, please.

185
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,599
Father?

186
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,030
What happened at Fort Wilderness?

187
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,354
Put it away.

188
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,153
Six-pounders.

189
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,629
Lots of them.

190
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,794
How far away?

191
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,508
They're a long way off. They're most
likely heading the other direction.

192
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,753
Put those in the house.

193
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,595
- They might come this way.
- Must I tell you again?

194
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,713
Let's all stay close in to the house,
all right?

195
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,399
We'll have to fight them off.

196
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,399
Won't Father do that?

197
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,675
They'll probably kill us men...

198
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,550
...and do Lord-knows-what
to you women.

199
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,279
Nathan!

200
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,028
Slowly turn.

201
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,629
Father.

202
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,028
Abigale!

203
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,313
Water and bandages, fast.

204
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,632
The battle. Were you there?

205
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,798
Have you seen any Redcoats?

206
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,479
No, not yet.

207
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,150
Abigale, the children, please.

208
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,675
Children, come. Upstairs.

209
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,515
Gates marched us straight
at the Redcoats.

210
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,315
Our lines broke. The British
Green Dragoons cut us to bits.

211
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,676
I was given these dispatches.

212
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,709
As I left, I saw
the Virginia Regulars surrender.

213
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,597
The Dragoons rode into them.

214
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,275
Killed them all.

215
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,152
Over 200 men.

216
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,039
I have to get these dispatches
to Hillsborough.

217
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,395
You can't ride.

218
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,949
I can't stay here!
It's not safe for-

219
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,159
Fire!

220
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,593
Fire!

221
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,508
Thank you for the care
of His Majesty's soldiers.

222
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,232
Have a detachment take our
wounded to our surgeons at Winnsboro.

223
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,789
Yes, sir.

224
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,709
Fire the house and barns.

225
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,077
Let it be known if you harbor
the enemy you will lose your home.

226
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,797
By order of King George...

227
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,310
...all slaves of the American colonies
who fight for the Crown...

228
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,791
...will be granted their freedom
with our victory.

229
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:55,116
We're not slaves. We work this land.
We're freedmen.

230
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,278
Then you're freedmen who will have
the privilege...

231
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,590
...of fighting in the king's army.

232
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,032
RebeI dispatches, sir.

233
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,519
Who carried this?

234
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,469
Who carried this?!

235
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,390
I did, sir.

236
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,871
I was wounded.
These people gave me care.

237
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,359
They have nothing to do
with the dispatches.

238
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,791
Take this one to Camden.
He is a spy.

239
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,036
Hang him, put his body on display.

240
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,357
He's a dispatch rider.

241
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,120
Destroy the livestock.
Save the horses for the Dragoons.

242
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,515
ColoneI, this is a uniformed
dispatch rider carrying a marked case.

243
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,994
He cannot be held as a spy.

244
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,794
Well, we won't hold him.
We're going to hang him.

245
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,719
- ColoneI-
- Father!

246
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,833
Oh, I see. He's your son.

247
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,553
Perhaps you should've taught him
something of loyalty.

248
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,879
ColoneI, I beg you, please reconsider.
By the rules of war-

249
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,516
Would you like a lesson, sir,
in the rules of war?

250
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,959
Or perhaps your children would.

251
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,359
No lesson is necessary.

252
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,355
Sir.

253
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,477
What of the rebeI wounded?

254
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,948
Kill them.

255
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,749
Father.

256
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,478
Father, do something!

257
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,669
Be quiet!

258
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,717
GabrieI, run!

259
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,789
Wait!

260
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,595
No!!

261
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,797
Stupid boy.

262
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,754
Captain.

263
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,513
Come, child.

264
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,595
I'm not leaving these children!

265
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,119
Mercy!

266
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,793
Get ready!

267
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,910
Present!

268
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,189
Fire!

269
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,913
All of you, stay here.

270
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,279
Nathan, SamueI.

271
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,029
Margaret.

272
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,834
Hide in the fields
with William and Susan.

273
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,634
If we're not back by sunset,
take them to Aunt Charlotte's.

274
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,034
Is that clear?

275
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,869
Boys.

276
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,268
It's a good spot.

277
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,670
Boys, listen to me.

278
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,758
I'll fire first.

279
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,558
Start with the officers
and work your way down.

280
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,398
Can you tell the difference?

281
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,595
Yes, Father.

282
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,552
- Yes, Father.
- Good.

283
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,548
SamueI, after your first shot,
reload for Nathan.

284
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,635
Now...

285
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,479
...if anything should happen to me,
drop your weapons.

286
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,272
Run as quickly as you can.

287
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,835
Get your brother and your sisters...

288
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,679
...and take them to
Aunt Charlotte's. Understood?

289
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,718
What did I say about shooting?

290
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,468
Aim small, miss small.

291
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,558
Aim small, miss small.

292
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,835
Boys...

293
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,594
...SamueI...

294
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,234
...steady.

295
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,195
Lord, make me fast and accurate.

296
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,989
Aim small, miss small.

297
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,839
Aim small, miss small.

298
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,674
Aim small, miss small.

299
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,518
- On the right!
- To the left!

300
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,351
Behind us! Up on the ridge!

301
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,954
Form right!

302
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,835
To the right!

303
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,034
About face!

304
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,353
On the right to the rear!

305
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,470
To the right!

306
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,195
Fire!

307
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,550
- Reload!
- Reload!

308
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,199
Behind you!

309
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,518
Look on the rear!

310
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,354
We have the private
the Cherokee scouts brought in.

311
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,588
Private?

312
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,829
Private.

313
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,951
ColoneI William Tavington,
Green Dragoons.

314
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,995
What happened? Who did this?

315
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,949
Him.

316
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,559
It was mad.

317
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,958
I couldn't tell you who it was.

318
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,191
Calm down. Calm down, man.

319
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,519
Twenty of His Majesty's soldiers
are dead.

320
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,029
And I need to know how.

321
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,390
- He said there was-
- Were you there?

322
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,751
Then let him speak.

323
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,591
Take your time and tell me.
How many were there?

324
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,631
Were they militia?
Were they Regulars?

325
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,350
I don't really remember how many.

326
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,749
Maybe one.

327
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,269
One man. Really?

328
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,198
He was in the flank.

329
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,232
All around us.

330
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,993
Amongst us.

331
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,995
I could barely see him.
He was there, then he was gone.

332
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,838
He just vanished.

333
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,349
Sounds more like a ghost than a man.

334
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,079
A ghost.

335
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,118
He was like a ghost.

336
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,914
Enough.

337
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,554
Bordon? Take a patroI.

338
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,593
Capture this ghost before
word of his exploits spread.

339
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,598
- Who's this?
- Sir, this is Captain Wilkins.

340
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,156
He was with the Loyalist ColoniaI
Militia. He might be of use.

341
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,392
Another coloniaI.

342
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,229
Captain Wilkins,
where do your loyalties lie?

343
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,515
To king and country.

344
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,229
Why should I trust a man who'd
betray his neighbors?

345
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,912
Those neighbors of mine who stand
against England...

346
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,712
...deserve to die a traitor's death.

347
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,790
We'll see.

348
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,353
Mr. Martin!

349
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,992
Miss Charlotte!

350
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,793
You're safe now. Try to sleep.

351
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,319
Good night.

352
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,629
Good night.

353
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,508
Father?

354
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,914
Yes.

355
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,910
I killed those men.

356
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,479
You did what I told you to do.

357
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,872
You did what you had to.
There was no wrong in it.

358
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,316
I'm glad I killed them.

359
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,278
I'm glad.

360
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,073
Get some rest.

361
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,797
You've done nothing for which
you should be ashamed.

362
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,113
I've done nothing.

363
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,831
And for that, I am ashamed.

364
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,040
Gates and the ContinentaI Army
are at Hillsborough.

365
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,714
I'm joining up with them.

366
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,836
No. Your place is here now.

367
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,110
I'm going back.
I'm a soldier, it's my duty.

368
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,911
Your duty is to your family.

369
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,357
Don't you walk away from me, boy!

370
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,834
I'll find you when it's over.

371
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,758
No, I forbid you to go!

372
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,349
- I'm not a child!
- You're my child!

373
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,275
Goodbye, Father.

374
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,318
Thomas is dead.

375
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,639
How many more have to die
before you'll heed my word?

376
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,391
I'm losing my family.

377
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,031
When will you be back, Father?

378
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,234
I don't know.

379
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:35,954
Tomorrow?

380
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,072
No, not tomorrow.

381
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,192
You say your prayers.

382
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,549
I will.

383
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,710
Take care of your brothers and sisters
and your Aunt Charlotte.

384
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,718
I'm depending on you.

385
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,477
As I am on you, SamueI.

386
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:52,989
All right.

387
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,828
Susan...

388
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,189
...goodbye.

389
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,674
Thank you.

390
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,873
Halt!

391
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,519
Make ready!

392
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,673
Take aim!

393
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,234
Fire!

394
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,472
I'm not going back.

395
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,236
No, I didn't expect you would.

396
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,870
That Gates is a damn fooI.

397
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,950
He spent too many years
in the British army.

398
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:12,119
Going muzzle-to-muzzle with Redcoats
in open field. It's madness.

399
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:13,869
Halt!

400
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,998
Make ready!

401
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,278
Present!

402
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,474
Fire!

403
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,834
This battle was over before it began.

404
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,314
Retreat!

405
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,712
Retreat!

406
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,994
These rustics are so inept.

407
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,754
Nearly takes the honor out of victory.

408
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:11,709
Nearly.

409
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,069
Hold him firm.

410
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,478
- Where's your commanding officer?
- That tent there.

411
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,552
It's a lost cause.

412
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,119
Benjamin Martin.

413
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,197
I'm in no mood for a lecture.

414
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,755
Where's your GeneraI Gates now?

415
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:13,079
The last anyone saw,
riding hard northeast...

416
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:16,118
...his staff 100 yards behind,
trying to catch up.

417
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,632
So who's in command?

418
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,479
I am.

419
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:22,713
I think.

420
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,159
What are my orders?

421
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,952
We're a breath away from losing
this war, Benjamin.

422
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:38,552
In the north, Washington is
reeling from Morristown.

423
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,320
He's running and hiding
from 12,000 Redcoats.

424
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,994
In the south, Cornwallis has
broken our back.

425
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:47,317
Captured over 5000 of our troops
when he took Charles Town.

426
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:50,552
And he destroyed the only army
between him and New York.

427
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:55,510
Nothing will stop him from
heading north to finish off Washington.

428
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:59,508
Unless we can keep Cornwallis
in the south till the French arrive.

429
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,273
They've promised a fleet
and 10,000 troops.

430
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:04,475
When?

431
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,389
Six months at the earliest.

432
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,870
You trust the French
to keep their word?

433
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,479
<i>Absolument.</i>

434
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:17,194
Benjamin Martin.
Major Jean Villeneuve.

435
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,960
French Seventh Light Foot.
He will help train the militia.

436
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:23,991
The hero of Fort Wilderness.
Your reputation precedes you.

437
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,717
You really expect to hold Cornwallis
here using just militia?

438
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,070
Not me. You.

439
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,396
They're not soldiers,
they're farmers.

440
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,870
They'd be better off letting
the British march through.

441
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,674
They'd be better off,
but the cause wouldn't.

442
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,636
How many men does Cornwallis have?

443
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,991
8000 infantry.

444
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,509
Around 600 cavalry.

445
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:54,188
I'm giving you a field commission
as a coloneI.

446
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,319
Might I request that you transfer
my son under my command?

447
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:58,794
Sir, no, I-

448
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,274
That's done.

449
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:04,709
Thank you.

450
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,511
ColoneI, I've been a soldier
for two years.

451
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,075
As a scout, horseman,
marksman, scavenger.

452
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,714
- Is that so?
- I'd be of better use with Regulars.

453
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,956
Where'd you learn all that
riding, shooting, scavenging?

454
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,752
My father taught me.

455
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,193
Teach you any humility?

456
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,512
He tried. It didn't take.

457
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,270
He also taught you every traiI
between here and Charles Town...

458
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,152
...which is why he transferred you.

459
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,314
We'll put the word out.
Start on the south side of-

460
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,676
We'll cover more ground
if we split up.

461
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:42,510
Very well, corporaI. You take
Harrisville, Pembroke, Wakefield.

462
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:46,713
I'll start on the north side.
Meet at the mission in Black Swamp.

463
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,629
CorporaI.

464
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,713
Be carefuI.

465
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:58,069
Yes, sir.

466
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,233
You have children?

467
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,079
French.

468
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,952
It skirts the mountain and then...

469
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:37,390
...extends down towards
the headwater here...

470
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:41,030
...and right across to the far bank
of the Ohio River.

471
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,629
It's 100,000 acres.

472
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:45,035
It's an imposing land grant, my lord.

473
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,800
You will be a country unto yourself.

474
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,998
His Majesty is most generous.

475
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:59,468
Though your service in this war
more than warrants such a gift.

476
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:04,831
Yes, this is how His Majesty
rewards those...

477
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,031
...who fight for him as gentlemen.

478
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:11,159
I dare to presume my own meager
contributions will be rewarded one day.

479
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:13,351
You may presume too much.

480
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,390
His Majesty, like history,
judges us by the outcome of the war...

481
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,631
...and the manner in which
it was fought.

482
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,518
We serve the Crown, and we must
conduct ourselves accordingly.

483
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,317
Surrendering troops
will be given quarter.

484
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,750
These brutaI tactics must stop!

485
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:31,710
Is it not enough that I have
never lost a battle?

486
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,035
You serve me...

487
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:37,392
...and the manner in which
you serve me reflects upon me!

488
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,831
I would've thought that a gentleman
from a family as esteemed as yours...

489
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,519
...would understand that.

490
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:48,074
My late father squandered any esteem
in which we were held...

491
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,077
...along with my inheritance.

492
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,914
I advance myself only through victory.

493
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:59,317
You advance yourself
only through my good graces.

494
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,951
These Colonials are our brethren.

495
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:07,756
And when this conflict is over,
we will reestablish commerce with them.

496
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,071
Do you understand, coloneI?

497
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:12,958
Perfectly, my lord.

498
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:57,079
Reverend, with your permission,
I'd like to make an announcement.

499
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,273
Young man, this is a house of God.

500
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,519
I understand that, reverend.
I apologize.

501
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:08,072
The South Carolina Militia is
being called up.

502
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,197
I'm here to enlist every man willing.

503
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:12,549
Son...

504
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,792
...we are here to pray...

505
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,719
...for the souls of those men
hanging outside.

506
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,717
Yes, pray for them.

507
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,155
But honor them by
taking up arms with us.

508
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,876
And bring more suffering to this town?

509
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:29,755
If King George can hang those men,
he can hang any one of us.

510
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:32,835
Dan Scott...

511
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:36,476
...barely a week ago you railed
for two hours about independence.

512
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,548
Mr. Hardwick, how many times
have I heard you...

513
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,194
...speak of freedom
at my father's table?

514
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:48,877
Half the men in this church,
including you, Father...

515
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,798
...and you, reverend...

516
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:55,073
...are as ardent patriots as I.

517
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:03,872
Will you now, when you are needed most,
stop at only words?

518
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,072
Is that the sort of men you are?

519
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,475
I ask only that you act
upon the beliefs...

520
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:20,513
...of which you have
so strongly spoken...

521
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,238
...and in which you
so strongly believe.

522
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:37,313
Who's with us?

523
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:37,550
Mr. Howard.

524
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:39,749
Sir...

525
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,350
...may I have permission to
write to Anne?

526
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,037
- May I have permission to write Anne?
- Yes.

527
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,513
You have permission...

528
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,677
...to write me.

529
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,951
Oh, write her.

530
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:58,634
Very well.

531
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:01,715
Thank you, sir.

532
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,388
Reverend?

533
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,996
A shepherd must tend his flock.

534
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:18,550
And, at times, fight off the wolves.

535
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:58,791
Are you sure this is the right place
to recruit for a militia?

536
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:07,472
God save King George!

537
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:28,231
I think we came to the right place.

538
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:37,313
- Any bounty?
- No scalp money this time, Rollins.

539
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:41,633
But you can keep or sell me the muskets
and gear of any Redcoat you kill.

540
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,634
They hanged my brother
down in Acworth.

541
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,948
Every damned one of them Redcoats
deserves to die.

542
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:00,673
- Sign up.
- With all my ailments...

543
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:03,758
...I wouldn't make it through
the first skirmish. No, sir.

544
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,758
But you can have my Negro.
He'll fight in my stead.

545
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,518
Occam! Get over here.

546
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:13,190
Ain't overly smart.
He's strong as a bull.

547
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:14,515
Can you write?

548
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:17,152
No, no, sir.

549
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:18,992
- Well, then, make your mark.
- Why?

550
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,112
I just signed him over to you.

551
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,390
If you're willing,
make your mark.

552
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:30,915
That'll do.

553
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:37,679
I'll kill me some Redcoats.

554
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:39,834
I believe you would.

555
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,315
How old are you?

556
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:44,028
Not quite old enough.
But his time will come.

557
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:46,629
John Billings.
I was hoping you'd turn up.

558
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:49,229
There's a story going around
about 20 Redcoats...

559
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:51,994
...got killed by a ghost
or some damn thing.

560
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,838
Carried a Cherokee tomahawk.

561
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:58,712
Aren't you a little old to be
believing in ghost stories?

562
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:03,758
How many did you get?

563
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,235
Twelve.

564
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:06,955
Good.

565
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:10,679
These men,
they're not the sort we need.

566
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:15,876
They're exactly the sort we need.

567
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:19,076
They've fought
this kind of war before.

568
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,551
What about me? Am I one of that sort?

569
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:26,268
Hell, no.

570
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,751
Your sort gives that sort a bad name.

571
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:37,391
I want accuracy and precision.

572
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:38,955
Make ready!

573
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:44,999
Take aim!

574
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,234
Fire!

575
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:30,357
<i>Dear Anne.;</i>

576
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,556
<i>Our force continues to grow.</i>

577
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:37,038
<i>As long as we continue to fight,
others will come to fight beside us.</i>

578
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:40,152
<i>I long to see you and speak to you.</i>

579
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:42,828
<i>I'm hopeful that our duties
will bring me near you.</i>

580
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:47,158
<i>Until then, I am and will remain
most affectionately yours.</i>

581
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:48,349
<i>Gabriel.</i>

582
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:15,119
We surrender!

583
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:18,559
No! God, stop!

584
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:20,159
For the love of God, we-

585
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:22,912
These men were about to surrender!

586
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:26,114
Perhaps.

587
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:27,355
We will never know.

588
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:28,789
This is murder!

589
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:32,318
Hell, reverend, they're Redcoats.
They've earned it.

590
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:37,349
- We're better than that.
- What do you know about war?

591
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,318
I know the difference
between fighting-

592
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,152
Go back to church!

593
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:42,554
Quiet!

594
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:45,594
He's right.

595
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:49,790
Quarter will be given to British
wounded and any who surrender.

596
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,549
They gave no quarter when they fired on
a ship carrying my wife and daughters.

597
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:57,757
I watched from 200 yards off
as they were burned alive.

598
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:01,154
- All my sympathy, but my order stands.
- Damn your sympathy.

599
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:04,110
Who are you to give such an order?

600
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:07,912
I know what you did
to my countrymen at Fort Wilderness.

601
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:13,597
We're militia.
This is not regular army.

602
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:17,029
Every man here is free to
come and go as he pleases.

603
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,468
But while you're here...

604
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:21,069
...you will obey my command
or I will have you shot.

605
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:28,711
- Damn dogs!
- Shoot the damn things!

606
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:30,399
Stay that pistoI.

607
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:31,914
They won't let you near the wagon.

608
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,989
- Rum, Madeira.
- No wonder they were guarding it.

609
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:41,309
Officers' uniforms.

610
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:43,357
What you think all this is worth?

611
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:47,957
It's the personaI correspondence
of Lord Cornwallis.

612
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:51,155
This is his journaI.

613
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:56,479
I say we drink the wine, eat the dogs
and use the papers for musket wadding.

614
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,034
Eat the dogs?

615
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:00,878
Dog is a fine meaI.

616
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,479
Good heavens.

617
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:17,871
I have some maps here for you.

618
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,594
Put them down over there. Thank you.

619
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:25,030
Here. A proper musket for you.

620
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:29,233
I don't know about you, but I don't like
the idea giving muskets to slaves.

621
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:33,995
Your sense of freedom is
as pale as your skin.

622
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:42,158
Don't listen to them.

623
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:46,668
If we win this war,
a lot of things will change.

624
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:48,999
What will change?

625
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:54,831
They call this the New World.
It's not. It's the same as the old.

626
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:59,788
But we'll have a chance
to build a new world.

627
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:07,072
A world where all men are
created equaI under God.

628
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:09,028
EquaI.

629
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:11,918
Sounds good.

630
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:15,474
I've just been in the mind
of a genius.

631
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:22,317
Cornwallis knows more about warfare than
we could learn in a dozen lifetimes.

632
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,154
That's cheerfuI news.

633
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:28,752
His victories at Camden and
Charles Town were perfect. Perfect.

634
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,517
And he knows it, what's more.

635
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,119
Perhaps that's his weakness.

636
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:36,715
Sir?

637
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:39,109
Pride.

638
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:41,593
Pride's a weakness.

639
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:44,554
Personally, I would prefer stupidity.

640
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:48,034
Pride will do.

641
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,552
Finished, my lord.

642
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,911
I've taken it in at the back...

643
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:05,714
...added wider epaulets
and looped gold braiding.

644
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:08,593
- It's a horse blanket.
- I don't know, my lord.

645
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:11,469
It's really quite nice.

646
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:14,319
- Very nice, my lord.
- Very well. It's a nice horse blanket.

647
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,798
ColoneI Tavington,
why, after six weeks...

648
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,992
...am I still attending a ball
in South Carolina...

649
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,794
...when I should be attending balls
in North Carolina?

650
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,513
First, the theft of my baggage...

651
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:29,393
...including my memoirs,
on which I spent countless hours.

652
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:33,236
Then half the bridges and ferries
between here and Charles Town burned.

653
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:36,473
If you can't protect our supply lines
against militia...

654
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:39,956
...how do you intend doing so against
the Regulars or the French?

655
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:42,674
They won't fight like Regulars.
We can't find them.

656
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:45,269
ColoneI, they're militia.

657
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:48,110
They're farmers with pitchforks!

658
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:51,235
They're rather more than that,
I'm afraid.

659
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,353
Made so by their commander,
this ghost.

660
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,279
Oh, ghost, ghost, ghost.

661
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,479
You created this ghost, coloneI.

662
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:02,872
Your brutality swelled his ranks.

663
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:05,275
Without them this ghost
would've disappeared...

664
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:07,755
...and I'd be
in North Carolina by now!

665
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,228
In my defense, my lord-

666
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:11,198
Oh, enough, enough!

667
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:15,953
A fine soldier you are,
bested by a bedtime story.

668
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:19,151
Give me the horse blanket.

669
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:25,237
O'Hara, our supply ship appears
to have arrived.

670
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,113
Yes, my lord, it has.

671
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:29,675
Then why am I still wearing this rag?

672
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:32,678
Your replacement wardrobe is
aboard ship, but...

673
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:36,839
...ColoneI Tavington thought it best to
secure our arms and munitions first.

674
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:38,109
They are being unloaded.

675
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:50,753
You look good in that color.

676
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,028
It stinks.

677
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,672
Well, it's had a dead man in it.

678
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,718
The beasts took your dogs too?

679
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:01,274
Yes.

680
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:05,277
Fine animals.
A gift from His Majesty.

681
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:07,639
Dead now, for all I know.

682
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:10,230
Is there no decency?

683
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:22,675
Oh, fireworks. Lovely!

684
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:54,839
Mr. Howard.

685
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:57,830
I've come to call on Anne.

686
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:06,352
I've come to call on Anne!

687
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,676
Well, of course you
call yourself a man.

688
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:12,871
Father, stop it. You heard him.

689
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:16,235
Well...

690
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:18,353
...call on her.

691
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:44,399
I'm nearly finished.

692
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:47,792
You needn't worry, Father.

693
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,399
Yeah, I know.

694
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:53,629
Bundling bags are a wonderfuI
tradition. I don't mind in the least.

695
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:56,799
Be still.

696
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:58,549
Tea?

697
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:00,635
Please.

698
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:03,475
There.

699
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:12,788
Come, dear.

700
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,239
It's very good.

701
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:30,236
I'm pleased that you like it.

702
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:39,869
Peter.

703
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:43,996
Don't worry. I sew better
than my mother did.

704
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,393
I hope so.

705
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:56,351
If you're just gonna stand there...

706
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,272
...why don't you read it for us?

707
01:13:58,520 --> 01:13:59,999
I can't read.

708
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:03,908
I can.

709
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:07,989
"Take notice.

710
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:12,230
By order of GeneraI Washington
and the ContinentaI Congress...

711
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:15,552
...all bound slaves who give
minimum one year service...

712
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,193
...in the ContinentaI Army...

713
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,956
...will be granted freedom...

714
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:24,229
...and be paid a bounty of five
shillings for each month of service. "

715
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:25,999
Did you hear that?

716
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:28,395
First they'll free them,
then they'll pay them.

717
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:31,790
Only another six months.

718
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,072
What will you do with freedom?

719
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,592
I made this for you.

720
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:05,998
Look after your mother.

721
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:12,713
You know, Peter...

722
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:14,913
...I can't pay you for this.

723
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:19,113
Benjamin, you pay me what you can,
when you can.

724
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:20,913
I'm obliged.

725
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:25,476
GabrieI sure reminds me a lot of you.

726
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,710
No, no, he's more like his mother.

727
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:31,555
CorporaI!

728
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:34,837
Take your time. Dogs.

729
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:52,469
Sir.

730
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,677
This road is closed.

731
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:41,236
These wagons now belong to
the ContinentaI Army.

732
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:44,109
Ready arms!

733
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:57,719
By twos!

734
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:09,836
There's no need for your men to die.
Leave the wagons and go.

735
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:11,998
This is the king's highway.

736
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,994
And I advise you and your men
to make way.

737
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:22,709
Charge!

738
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:24,749
Fire!

739
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,319
Retreat!

740
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:35,393
Save yourselves!

741
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:03,355
Retreat!

742
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:23,475
Ambush! Ambush!

743
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:57,238
I have the count.

744
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:00,392
22 are dead.

745
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:03,355
18 wounded and 20 are missing.

746
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:04,914
I'm through.

747
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:12,272
He won't be the last to leave.

748
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:15,070
Trust me.
Soon my countrymen will arrive.

749
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:17,032
- The French army is-
- To hell with you.

750
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:18,873
And to hell with the French army.

751
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:20,149
We don't need them.

752
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:23,472
We got Benjamin Martin.
We know what he done to the French.

753
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:38,674
Father.

754
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:43,478
Men always buy you drinks because
of what happened at Fort Wilderness.

755
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:48,274
Strangers know more
about you than I do.

756
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:51,872
Tell me what happened.

757
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:57,511
Your mother asked me that question
around about the time you were born.

758
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:02,674
I was drunk and foolish enough
to answer it.

759
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:12,396
The French and the Cherokee had raided
along the Blue Ridge.

760
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:16,038
The English settlers had sought refuge
at Fort Charles.

761
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:19,552
By the time we got there,
the fort was abandoned.

762
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,836
They'd left about a week before.

763
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:26,708
<i>But what we found was...</i>

764
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:30,554
Go on.

765
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:36,916
They'd killed all the settlers,
the men.

766
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,598
With the women and...

767
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,916
<i>...some of the children, they had...</i>

768
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:48,713
We buried them all,
what was left of them.

769
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,874
We caught up with them
at Fort Wilderness.

770
01:20:56,840 --> 01:20:58,353
We took our time.

771
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:03,478
We cut them apart slowly.

772
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:05,758
Piece by piece.

773
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:12,791
I can see their faces.

774
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:18,070
I can still hear their screams.

775
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:23,277
All but two. We let them live.

776
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:26,636
We sent the heads on a pallet...

777
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:29,354
...with the two that lived
back to Fort Ambercon.

778
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:33,231
The eyes, tongues, fingers...

779
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:35,311
...we put in baskets.

780
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:38,513
Sent them down the Asheulot
to the Cherokee.

781
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:43,756
Soon after, the Cherokee broke
their treaty with the French.

782
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:48,397
That's how we justified it.

783
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:58,399
We were...

784
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:01,279
...heroes.

785
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,670
And men bought you drinks.

786
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:14,034
Not a day goes by where I don't ask
God's forgiveness for what I did.

787
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:25,714
Thomas was my brother,
as well as your son.

788
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:29,828
You may not believe this, but I want
satisfaction as much as you do.

789
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:33,751
But not at the expense of our cause.

790
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:37,388
There will be a time for revenge.

791
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:40,675
But untiI then, stay the course.

792
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:45,792
Your mother said that when
I'd get drunk or lose my temper.

793
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,389
She'd say it to me
when I picked on Thomas.

794
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:55,479
I miss him.

795
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:14,312
The British got 18 of our men
at Fort Carolina.

796
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:17,639
They'll be hung one at a time untiI
they give up the rest of us.

797
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:34,148
Reverend...

798
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:36,237
...can you write a letter for me?

799
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:39,228
- To my wife and boy.
- Yes, of course I will.

800
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:42,233
But first let us pray.

801
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:57,510
<i>My lord...</i>

802
01:23:57,720 --> 01:23:59,517
...there is a rider at the gates.

803
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:02,518
A civilian carrying a white flag.

804
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:04,233
I am occupied.

805
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:06,995
He has a pair of dogs with him.

806
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:09,915
Great Danes.

807
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:11,790
<i>And dear Lord...</i>

808
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,230
...protect us in this,
our hour of need.

809
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:17,956
<i>This we ask in the name
of the Father, the Son...</i>

810
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:19,832
And the Holy Ghost.

811
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:25,909
<i>Wait here.</i>

812
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:28,475
GeneraI Lord Cornwallis will be
with you shortly.

813
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:12,913
Jupiter, Mars. Come, boys.

814
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:16,709
Come.

815
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:23,794
My good boys. My brave boys.
You seem to be well-fed.

816
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,113
I thank you for that.

817
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:29,754
I'm afraid I don't know your name.

818
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:34,039
I'm a coloneI in the ContinentaI Army.
My rank should be sufficient for now.

819
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:36,279
As you wish.

820
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:38,229
Please be seated.

821
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:39,475
Thank you.

822
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:44,789
Would you, as the initiating officer,
care to begin?

823
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:48,158
I will, unless you'd like to
claim aggrieved status.

824
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:50,920
Yes, I would like to claim
aggrieved status.

825
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:52,758
Very well, sir. Proceed.

826
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:57,312
You have in your possession belongings
of mine including clothing...

827
01:25:57,560 --> 01:26:00,950
...furniture, personaI effects
of a non-military nature...

828
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,272
...which I'd like returned to me.

829
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:06,319
Indeed. I will do so
as soon as possible.

830
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:08,875
Thank you.

831
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:12,237
Now we come to the matter
of the specific targeting...

832
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,277
...of officers during engagements.

833
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:17,757
You must know that in civilized
warfare, officers in the field...

834
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:22,158
...must not be accorded inappropriate
levels of hostile attention.

835
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:26,556
To your mind, what are appropriate
levels of hostile attention?

836
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:28,955
Imagine the chaos that would follow...

837
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:32,272
...from leaderless armies
having at each other.

838
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:35,752
There must be gentlemen in command
to lead...

839
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:39,157
...and, where necessary,
restrain their men.

840
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:44,079
Restrain them from, say, targeting
civilians. Women, children and such.

841
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:48,429
That's a separate issue.

842
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:50,517
No. I consider them linked.

843
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:53,754
And as long as your soldiers
attack civilians...

844
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:56,918
...I will order the shooting
of officers at every engagement.

845
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:01,715
And my men are excellent marksmen.

846
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:06,789
Very well.

847
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:10,193
- Now, let us move on to-
- Prisoner exchange.

848
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:12,275
Sir?

849
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:16,277
You have 18 of my men.
I want them back.

850
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:27,311
I do have 18 criminals
under sentence of death...

851
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:29,949
...but I hold no prisoners of war.

852
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:33,313
If that's your position,
18 of your officers will have to die.

853
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:35,551
Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.

854
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:36,749
My officers?

855
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:37,949
Sir.

856
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:48,033
Top of the ridge, to your left.
Below the tree line.

857
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:01,755
Their names and ranks?

858
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:05,868
They refused to give names. There are
9 lieutenants, 5 captains, 3 majors...

859
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:07,798
...and one fat coloneI
who called me...

860
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:11,318
...a cheeky fellow.

861
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:14,399
This is not the conduct
of a gentleman.

862
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:17,552
If the conduct of your officers is
the measure of a gentleman...

863
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,751
...I'll take that as a compliment.

864
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:22,829
Get my men.

865
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:29,239
- Arrange the exchange.
- My lord.

866
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:30,595
Thank you, sir.

867
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:02,552
Release the prisoners!

868
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:09,190
- What is this?
- Prisoner exchange.

869
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:10,879
He has 18 of our officers.

870
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:12,911
Who is he? I recognize him.

871
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:14,952
He's the commander of the militia.

872
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:17,275
Your ghost.

873
01:29:17,480 --> 01:29:19,072
Stay that sword, coloneI!

874
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:21,550
He rode in under a white flag
for formaI parley.

875
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:23,148
This is madness.

876
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:25,870
If you harm him,
you condemn our officers.

877
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:31,478
With respect, sir, he's killed as many
officers in the last two months.

878
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:35,992
He has shown no aggression here.
Hence he cannot be touched.

879
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:37,759
Has he not?

880
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:42,195
You!

881
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:45,713
So you're the ghost, are you?
I remember you!

882
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:47,911
On that farm! That stupid little boy!

883
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:55,959
Did he die?

884
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:00,955
You know...

885
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:03,914
...it's an ugly business,
doing one's duty.

886
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:06,156
But just occasionally...

887
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:08,392
...it's a reaI pleasure.

888
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:15,039
Before this war is over,
I'm going to kill you.

889
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:19,953
Why wait?

890
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:30,035
Soon.

891
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:02,869
Move out!

892
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:10,677
But I still think it's imperative
to push north.

893
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:15,950
One of our captured officers, my lord.

894
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:23,791
<i>My reputation suffers
because of your incompetence!</i>

895
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:27,151
That man insults me!

896
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:31,189
Quite impressive for a farmer with
a pitchfork, wouldn't you say?

897
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:40,674
I want you to find that man.

898
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:43,316
I want you to capture him.

899
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:46,796
The man has the loyalty of the people.

900
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:49,555
They protect him. Protect his family.

901
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:51,318
Protect the families of his men.

902
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:54,591
I can capture him for you.

903
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:59,789
<i>But to do so requires the use
of tactics that are somewhat...</i>

904
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,116
What was the word
your lordship used?

905
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:06,478
" BrutaI," I think.

906
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:15,829
Go on.

907
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:27,034
I am prepared to do what is necessary.

908
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:31,638
I alone will assume the full mantle
of responsibility for my actions...

909
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:33,876
...free of the chain of command...

910
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:36,230
...rendering you blameless.

911
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:38,159
However...

912
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:40,078
...if I do this...

913
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:44,068
...you and I both know that I can
never return to England with honor.

914
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:50,795
What, I wonder, is to become of me?

915
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:00,913
When this war is over here
in the Colonies...

916
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:03,078
...the new aristocracy...

917
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:06,832
...will be landowners.

918
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:16,354
Tell me about Ohio.

919
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:22,909
Make way.

920
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:25,154
As you were.

921
01:33:28,160 --> 01:33:32,073
Wilkins. A plantation seven miles
from Wakefield, on the Santee...

922
01:33:32,280 --> 01:33:34,475
...east of Black Swamp.
Who lived there?

923
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:37,799
Benjamin Martin.

924
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:38,955
He's the ghost.

925
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:41,714
What do you know about him?

926
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:45,549
Hell, everything.
I could tell you the size of his boot.

927
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:49,949
Does he have family?
Where would he hide his children?

928
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:00,948
His wife's sister has a plantation.

929
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:02,913
It's not far.

930
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:38,392
Aunt Charlotte!
Wake up, someone's coming!

931
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:45,272
Get the boys.

932
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:50,114
Margaret, come quickly.

933
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:52,993
- Let's go.
- Boys, come.

934
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:54,549
Go.

935
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,672
Stay close.

936
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:07,553
This way.

937
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:24,588
Follow me.

938
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:30,274
We'll go downstairs to the kitchen.

939
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:38,355
Margaret, quick!
Get down there! Fast!

940
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,716
SamueI, get down there fast!

941
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:48,631
Beneath the sill. There.

942
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:52,559
There's no one in the house.

943
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:54,159
They can't be far.

944
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:56,869
Search the outbuildings
and the woods, quickly.

945
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:34,837
Prepare to fire the house.

946
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:36,919
Go.

947
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:57,751
This one's head of the house slaves.

948
01:38:02,720 --> 01:38:04,233
Where are they hiding?

949
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:10,195
Keep looking!
They're here somewhere!

950
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:17,472
- GabrieI.
- Where's Father?

951
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:19,318
Torch the house!

952
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:37,235
To horse!

953
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:45,918
Come on! It's all right.

954
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:47,951
Susan, come here.

955
01:38:56,760 --> 01:38:57,909
Charlotte!

956
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:15,833
They won't stop looking for us.

957
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:20,110
You'll be safe where we're taking you.

958
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:23,514
Father said it was
a perfect place to hide.

959
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:27,313
How is he?

960
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:34,072
I don't know. I'm his son.

961
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,117
Where is Father?

962
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,113
Speaking for months now.

963
01:39:39,320 --> 01:39:40,833
Speaking for months.

964
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:42,792
Why did he go?

965
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:48,589
He didn't want those mean men
to find you, so he led them away.

966
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:51,075
He'll come see you as soon as he can.

967
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:53,909
I don't care. I hate him.

968
01:39:55,560 --> 01:39:57,198
Susan, you don't hate him.

969
01:39:57,400 --> 01:40:00,756
I hate him, and I hope
he never comes back.

970
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:34,997
It's the children.

971
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:36,989
Abigale!

972
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:40,279
You're alive!

973
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:52,715
She spoke. Susan talked to you?

974
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:54,512
In full sentences.

975
01:40:54,720 --> 01:40:57,234
As if she'd been speaking all along.

976
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:01,397
Damn, I wasn't there for it.

977
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:03,629
What did she say?

978
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:07,798
She said...

979
01:41:09,240 --> 01:41:12,277
...that she loves you
and misses you...

980
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:14,835
...but understands
why you can't be with her.

981
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:19,832
My Lord, she said that.

982
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:21,799
Isn't that something?

983
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:28,513
Tavington has a list of our men.
He's burning our homes...

984
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:30,517
...killing whomever resists.

985
01:41:31,120 --> 01:41:32,075
Where?

986
01:41:32,280 --> 01:41:34,396
Seven homes along the Santee so far.

987
01:42:30,720 --> 01:42:32,950
John, this is not a time
for vengeance.

988
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:36,188
This is a time for mourning.

989
01:43:09,240 --> 01:43:10,912
Attend to your families.

990
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:15,395
One week furlough for all men.

991
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:20,318
Any man who does not return will not
be thought a coward or uncommitted.

992
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:37,034
Father!

993
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:40,039
Papa!

994
01:43:46,040 --> 01:43:47,871
They're huge.
What have you been feeding them?

995
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:51,072
They're from good stock
on their father's side.

996
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:00,628
Susan?

997
01:44:39,160 --> 01:44:42,391
I see it. There it is. Look.
Look, father.

998
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:46,277
I got it! I got it!

999
01:44:46,720 --> 01:44:47,675
You got it.

1000
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:49,719
I got it!

1001
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:50,955
- CarefuI.
- I caught it.

1002
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:53,674
- All the fish are over here.
- Let's get them.

1003
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:02,077
Father, what changed you?

1004
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:06,198
Are you sure I have?

1005
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:09,233
Yes. You changed.

1006
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:17,719
That's simple.

1007
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:19,475
It was your mother.

1008
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:27,398
A woman can have a strange effect
on a man.

1009
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:30,198
There were times...

1010
01:45:30,840 --> 01:45:32,990
...I had trouble breathing
around your mother.

1011
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:35,752
I know the feeling.

1012
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:39,318
You once said...

1013
01:45:42,160 --> 01:45:44,594
...when I had a family of my own,
I'd understand.

1014
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:49,879
You were right.

1015
01:45:52,360 --> 01:45:54,157
You're trying to tell me something.

1016
01:46:10,360 --> 01:46:11,679
- Apple?
- Thank you.

1017
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:19,549
Congratulations.

1018
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:21,352
<i>Anne Patricia Howard...</i>

1019
01:46:21,640 --> 01:46:25,599
...will you have this man to be
your husband to live in marriage?

1020
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:28,388
Will you love, comfort
and honor him...

1021
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:30,716
...for so long as you both shall live?

1022
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:32,599
I will.

1023
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:36,072
GabrieI Edward Martin, will you have
this woman to be your wife...

1024
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:38,840
...to live together
in the covenant of marriage?

1025
01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:42,954
Will you love, comfort and honor her
as long as you both shall live?

1026
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:44,435
I will.

1027
01:46:44,640 --> 01:46:47,359
Then by the power vested in me
by our mutuaI faith...

1028
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:49,397
...in the Lord, our God...

1029
01:46:49,640 --> 01:46:52,791
...I now pronounce you man and wife.

1030
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:20,990
I'm sorry we didn't give you
more warning.

1031
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:22,189
It's fine.

1032
01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:24,113
I have something for you.

1033
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:28,478
It belonged to GabrieI's mother.

1034
01:47:28,680 --> 01:47:30,318
It's beautifuI.

1035
01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:32,474
Allow me.

1036
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:35,159
It's the North Star.

1037
01:47:35,720 --> 01:47:39,156
That's the only star in the sky
that never moves.

1038
01:47:39,560 --> 01:47:42,358
It's constant, unwavering.

1039
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:44,114
A guide.

1040
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:48,993
I'd be honored.

1041
01:47:54,080 --> 01:47:55,035
May I?

1042
01:47:55,240 --> 01:47:57,231
- If you must.
- I must.

1043
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:14,273
May I sit with you?

1044
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:16,471
It's a free country.

1045
01:48:17,160 --> 01:48:18,513
Or at least it will be.

1046
01:48:30,280 --> 01:48:32,271
I'm not my sister.

1047
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:34,872
I know that.

1048
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:36,959
Do you?

1049
01:48:38,200 --> 01:48:39,679
Yes, I do.

1050
01:48:40,680 --> 01:48:42,193
Very well, then.

1051
01:48:46,640 --> 01:48:47,595
Well?

1052
01:48:49,240 --> 01:48:50,468
Well what?

1053
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:13,512
I'll see you in Pembroke soon.

1054
01:49:13,720 --> 01:49:15,392
Not soon enough.

1055
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:17,871
I'm counting on you to make sure-

1056
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:19,559
- I know.
- What?

1057
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:21,398
Say my prayers, take care of everyone.

1058
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:23,159
Couldn't have said it better.

1059
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:28,749
Goodbye.

1060
01:49:29,320 --> 01:49:30,548
Goodbye.

1061
01:49:49,880 --> 01:49:51,074
Goodbye, Susan.

1062
01:49:53,560 --> 01:49:54,675
Goodbye?

1063
01:49:57,680 --> 01:49:59,272
Just one word, that's all I want.

1064
01:50:08,120 --> 01:50:09,155
All right.

1065
01:50:35,720 --> 01:50:37,073
Papa!

1066
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:41,915
Papa, don't go! I'll say anything.

1067
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:47,799
Please, Papa.

1068
01:50:50,120 --> 01:50:52,076
I'll say anything you want.

1069
01:50:52,280 --> 01:50:55,272
Tell me what you want me to say.
I'll say anything.

1070
01:50:58,040 --> 01:51:00,713
I promise, Papa. Please don't go.

1071
01:51:01,800 --> 01:51:03,074
I promise.

1072
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:05,319
I'll come back.

1073
01:51:06,120 --> 01:51:08,076
I'll come back. You believe me?

1074
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:13,351
You know, you make me very happy.

1075
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:49,512
Just the three of us?

1076
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:52,269
John Raskin did come by earlier.

1077
01:51:53,080 --> 01:51:54,911
He looked around, then he left.

1078
01:51:55,960 --> 01:51:57,234
He would've made four.

1079
01:51:57,720 --> 01:51:59,392
Four would have been better.

1080
01:52:33,240 --> 01:52:36,471
I got another two months to go
before I get to twelve months.

1081
01:52:41,640 --> 01:52:42,629
ColoneI.

1082
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:44,988
Reverend.

1083
01:52:48,360 --> 01:52:49,759
Trust the French.

1084
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:51,669
Yes, trust the French.

1085
01:52:51,880 --> 01:52:55,316
Where else do I get the opportunity
to kill a few Redcoats?

1086
01:52:55,840 --> 01:52:58,912
Perhaps a few wounded ones
when you are not looking.

1087
01:53:24,520 --> 01:53:26,556
Everyone must gather at the church.

1088
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:27,950
Mr. Wilkins?

1089
01:53:29,480 --> 01:53:32,472
ColoneI Tavington wishes to address
the whole village.

1090
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:53,319
This town has given aid to
Benjamin Martin and his rebels.

1091
01:53:53,880 --> 01:53:55,632
I wish to know his whereabouts.

1092
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:58,314
So...

1093
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:00,357
...anyone who comes forward...

1094
01:54:00,720 --> 01:54:02,790
...may be forgiven their treason.

1095
01:54:08,280 --> 01:54:09,235
Very well.

1096
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:11,829
- You had your chance.
- Wait!

1097
01:54:12,920 --> 01:54:15,036
- This man gives them supplies.
- Quiet!

1098
01:54:15,240 --> 01:54:17,117
- He brings them to Black Swamp.
- Liar!

1099
01:54:17,320 --> 01:54:19,311
In the marsh,
by the old Spanish mission.

1100
01:54:20,280 --> 01:54:21,395
This man here?

1101
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:23,677
- Yes.
- The Black Swamp, you say?

1102
01:54:24,040 --> 01:54:25,951
By the old Spanish mission.

1103
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:29,313
Thank you very much.

1104
01:54:35,240 --> 01:54:36,719
Shut the doors.

1105
01:54:38,840 --> 01:54:40,717
But you said we'd be forgiven.

1106
01:54:40,920 --> 01:54:42,035
And indeed you may!

1107
01:54:44,760 --> 01:54:46,352
That's between you and God.

1108
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:54,599
Be strong. We must.

1109
01:54:56,480 --> 01:54:58,038
I'll fire the town on your orders.

1110
01:54:58,240 --> 01:54:59,514
The town?

1111
01:55:00,280 --> 01:55:01,759
Burn the church.

1112
01:55:04,200 --> 01:55:05,872
There's no honor in this.

1113
01:55:08,120 --> 01:55:10,793
Didn't you say all those who stand
against England...

1114
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,389
...deserve to die a traitor's death?

1115
01:55:15,960 --> 01:55:18,554
Burn the church, captain.

1116
01:55:30,200 --> 01:55:31,155
Give me the torch.

1117
01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:14,949
The honor is found in the end,
not the means.

1118
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:17,838
This will be forgotten.

1119
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:19,629
Bordon.

1120
01:57:55,200 --> 01:57:56,474
Anne!

1121
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:02,038
Mrs. Howard?

1122
01:58:06,040 --> 01:58:07,712
Where is everybody?

1123
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:14,590
They're not here.

1124
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:21,399
GabrieI's gone.

1125
02:00:04,840 --> 02:00:07,115
To arms! To arms!

1126
02:04:16,120 --> 02:04:17,348
Father.

1127
02:04:18,680 --> 02:04:20,796
Just don't talk. Don't talk.

1128
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:28,069
Father.

1129
02:04:28,600 --> 02:04:30,670
- I'm sorry.
- Be quiet.

1130
02:04:30,880 --> 02:04:32,916
I'll take care of you.
You'll be all right.

1131
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:39,276
I'm sorry about Thomas.

1132
02:04:44,960 --> 02:04:47,190
Oh, son, that wasn't your fault.

1133
02:04:51,120 --> 02:04:52,314
That was mine.

1134
02:04:56,520 --> 02:04:59,592
Hold on. You're gonna be all right.

1135
02:05:02,120 --> 02:05:04,918
Don't go. GabrieI, don't.

1136
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:34,995
Oh, God help me. God help me.

1137
02:06:07,680 --> 02:06:08,908
Where is he?

1138
02:06:16,560 --> 02:06:18,357
I'll help you bury him.

1139
02:06:20,480 --> 02:06:21,708
I'll bury him.

1140
02:06:24,840 --> 02:06:27,513
My wife in Alexandria is with child.

1141
02:06:28,920 --> 02:06:30,558
My first.

1142
02:06:31,160 --> 02:06:32,957
I fight for that child.

1143
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:37,875
Benjamin, nothing will replace
your sons.

1144
02:06:39,160 --> 02:06:43,153
But if you come with us,
you can justify their sacrifice.

1145
02:06:44,920 --> 02:06:46,273
Why?

1146
02:06:47,960 --> 02:06:51,794
Why do men feeI
they can justify death?

1147
02:06:58,120 --> 02:06:59,951
Is it arrogance or...?

1148
02:07:04,480 --> 02:07:06,357
I have long feared...

1149
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:11,390
...that my sins would return
to visit me.

1150
02:07:14,240 --> 02:07:16,754
And the cost is more than I can bear.

1151
02:07:18,040 --> 02:07:21,715
Benjamin, we have a chance.

1152
02:07:22,240 --> 02:07:25,312
Greene and Dan Morgan are
down from Virginia.

1153
02:07:27,920 --> 02:07:31,310
If we win this next battle, victory
in the war is within our grasp.

1154
02:07:31,560 --> 02:07:32,515
Go, then.

1155
02:07:32,760 --> 02:07:34,557
Seek your victory.

1156
02:07:37,720 --> 02:07:40,712
- I'm small issue to it.
- You're wrong, Benjamin.

1157
02:07:41,400 --> 02:07:43,311
You matter to your men...

1158
02:07:44,760 --> 02:07:46,591
...and to others as well.

1159
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:48,718
Your victories...

1160
02:07:48,920 --> 02:07:50,717
...and your losses...

1161
02:07:51,960 --> 02:07:54,110
...are shared by more than you know.

1162
02:07:55,160 --> 02:07:57,230
Stay with us.

1163
02:07:57,720 --> 02:07:59,551
Stay the course.

1164
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:10,996
I have run my course.

1165
02:08:30,200 --> 02:08:32,589
You men will be leaving with us.

1166
02:08:35,320 --> 02:08:36,799
Prepare the baggage.

1167
02:09:38,680 --> 02:09:39,669
Jean.

1168
02:10:30,640 --> 02:10:33,677
Tomorrow's battle can alter
the course of the war.

1169
02:10:33,880 --> 02:10:36,758
GeneraI Greene, what exactly is
the task before us?

1170
02:10:36,960 --> 02:10:39,918
Gentlemen, Cornwallis has us cornered.

1171
02:10:40,560 --> 02:10:42,198
Not only does he outnumber us...

1172
02:10:42,400 --> 02:10:45,312
...but nearly half of our force
is militia.

1173
02:10:46,600 --> 02:10:48,795
Unreliable, at best.

1174
02:10:49,120 --> 02:10:50,872
Excuse me, sir.

1175
02:10:52,520 --> 02:10:54,192
You underestimate our militia.

1176
02:10:56,320 --> 02:10:57,639
All of you do.

1177
02:10:58,400 --> 02:11:00,960
We've seen our militia lines break
time and again.

1178
02:11:01,160 --> 02:11:02,718
Kips Bay, Princeton.

1179
02:11:03,080 --> 02:11:05,071
But the British have seen that too.

1180
02:11:05,960 --> 02:11:09,555
Cornwallis' own letters bear out that
he has no respect for the militia.

1181
02:11:10,280 --> 02:11:12,555
What are you suggesting, Ben?

1182
02:11:13,920 --> 02:11:15,751
I'm suggesting we use that.

1183
02:11:22,640 --> 02:11:26,474
I know you men have sacrificed
a lot so far.

1184
02:11:26,680 --> 02:11:29,911
But all I'm asking is that you...

1185
02:11:30,120 --> 02:11:33,157
...let the front line of the militia
fire two shots tomorrow.

1186
02:11:35,240 --> 02:11:38,198
A lot can happen in the time it takes
to fire two shots.

1187
02:11:38,480 --> 02:11:40,835
Especially against British Regulars.

1188
02:11:41,800 --> 02:11:45,395
Indeed. That's why I'm not asking you
to fire three.

1189
02:12:40,200 --> 02:12:42,475
If I die, I will die well-dressed.

1190
02:13:26,800 --> 02:13:27,869
Fire!

1191
02:13:31,560 --> 02:13:34,313
- Battalion!
- Company, halt!

1192
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:51,755
Harry...

1193
02:13:52,680 --> 02:13:54,557
...will you give this to my children?

1194
02:14:04,680 --> 02:14:05,795
Thank you.

1195
02:14:14,640 --> 02:14:16,278
It's October now.

1196
02:14:18,800 --> 02:14:19,994
I know.

1197
02:14:20,760 --> 02:14:22,591
It's more than 12 months.

1198
02:14:23,040 --> 02:14:24,268
You're a free man.

1199
02:14:25,400 --> 02:14:28,073
I'm here now on my own accord.

1200
02:14:31,760 --> 02:14:33,751
I'm honored to have you with us.

1201
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:37,194
Honored.

1202
02:14:38,760 --> 02:14:41,194
Shoulder arms!

1203
02:14:46,680 --> 02:14:48,238
Forward...

1204
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:50,228
...march!

1205
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:56,718
How old were your daughters?

1206
02:14:58,720 --> 02:15:01,109
Violette was 12 and Pauline, 10.

1207
02:15:02,240 --> 02:15:04,117
They had green eyes.

1208
02:15:05,360 --> 02:15:07,032
I'm sure they were lovely.

1209
02:15:08,640 --> 02:15:10,358
Yes, they were.

1210
02:15:21,600 --> 02:15:22,749
- Battalion!
- Company!

1211
02:15:23,120 --> 02:15:24,235
March!

1212
02:15:26,360 --> 02:15:27,588
Fire!

1213
02:15:30,240 --> 02:15:31,468
Unless I'm dreaming...

1214
02:15:32,120 --> 02:15:35,954
...I believe I see militia forming
at their center.

1215
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:51,990
Battalion, halt!

1216
02:16:09,400 --> 02:16:11,152
Dress ranks!

1217
02:16:19,600 --> 02:16:21,033
Make ready!

1218
02:16:32,280 --> 02:16:34,032
Battalion!

1219
02:16:34,240 --> 02:16:35,275
Halt!

1220
02:16:38,200 --> 02:16:39,315
Take aim!

1221
02:16:42,760 --> 02:16:43,670
Fire!

1222
02:16:54,320 --> 02:16:55,389
Fire!

1223
02:17:15,520 --> 02:17:16,714
Hold the line!

1224
02:17:22,480 --> 02:17:25,597
- Prepare to charge!
- We haven't been given that order.

1225
02:17:25,960 --> 02:17:27,154
Charge!

1226
02:17:28,280 --> 02:17:29,315
Charge!

1227
02:17:32,720 --> 02:17:34,039
Tavington.

1228
02:17:34,240 --> 02:17:36,356
Damn him! Damn that man!

1229
02:17:38,160 --> 02:17:39,593
Make ready.

1230
02:17:40,160 --> 02:17:41,593
Take aim!

1231
02:17:42,480 --> 02:17:43,390
Fire!

1232
02:17:44,680 --> 02:17:45,954
Take aim!

1233
02:17:46,840 --> 02:17:47,795
Fire!

1234
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:49,069
Retreat!

1235
02:17:54,880 --> 02:17:58,714
Bayonet charge. We'll see who takes
the glory from this field.

1236
02:17:59,080 --> 02:18:00,638
Charge!

1237
02:18:19,680 --> 02:18:20,999
Congratulations, my lord.

1238
02:18:21,400 --> 02:18:22,799
Infantry reserve into the center.

1239
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:24,228
But you've taken the field.

1240
02:18:24,480 --> 02:18:25,754
Now we'll take their spirits.

1241
02:18:25,960 --> 02:18:28,872
Send the battalion over that hill
and crush them.

1242
02:18:29,080 --> 02:18:30,479
It ends today.

1243
02:18:52,800 --> 02:18:53,915
Hold the charge!

1244
02:18:54,840 --> 02:18:55,875
Fire!

1245
02:18:56,080 --> 02:18:58,275
Hold the charge!

1246
02:19:01,880 --> 02:19:03,199
Fire!

1247
02:19:08,520 --> 02:19:09,555
Take aim!

1248
02:19:11,120 --> 02:19:12,075
Fire!

1249
02:19:20,640 --> 02:19:22,119
Charge!

1250
02:19:28,680 --> 02:19:30,193
Charge bayonets!

1251
02:19:58,200 --> 02:19:59,315
Halt!

1252
02:20:00,480 --> 02:20:01,959
Hold! Dress your ranks!

1253
02:20:04,360 --> 02:20:05,509
Fire!

1254
02:20:08,920 --> 02:20:10,353
Charge!

1255
02:20:33,040 --> 02:20:34,632
Retreat!

1256
02:20:39,680 --> 02:20:40,749
ColoneI!

1257
02:20:42,560 --> 02:20:43,913
The line is faltering!

1258
02:20:45,320 --> 02:20:47,709
Retreat! Retreat!

1259
02:20:55,280 --> 02:20:56,633
Wait!

1260
02:20:57,400 --> 02:20:59,072
No retreat!

1261
02:21:02,720 --> 02:21:04,870
Hold the line!

1262
02:21:06,400 --> 02:21:08,470
Hold the line!

1263
02:21:19,680 --> 02:21:22,592
Push forward, men!

1264
02:22:10,040 --> 02:22:12,235
Artillery, concentrate on the center.

1265
02:22:26,840 --> 02:22:30,389
If we reform and wheeI right,
we may be able to turn their flank.

1266
02:22:30,680 --> 02:22:32,511
You dream, generaI.

1267
02:25:27,560 --> 02:25:29,994
Kill me before the war is over,
will you?

1268
02:25:31,600 --> 02:25:34,160
It appears you are not...

1269
02:25:34,360 --> 02:25:36,476
...the better man.

1270
02:25:49,640 --> 02:25:50,629
You're right.

1271
02:25:55,200 --> 02:25:57,236
My sons were better men.

1272
02:26:23,840 --> 02:26:25,239
Sound the retreat.

1273
02:26:28,640 --> 02:26:30,039
Sound...

1274
02:26:31,120 --> 02:26:32,269
...retreat.

1275
02:26:49,600 --> 02:26:50,555
<i>Dear Charlotte.;</i>

1276
02:26:51,280 --> 02:26:52,952
<i>The war has turned.</i>

1277
02:26:53,160 --> 02:26:56,630
<i>General Cornwallis took flight
with his army and moved north.</i>

1278
02:26:56,920 --> 02:26:59,718
<i>We continued to engage the British,
and in the following months...</i>

1279
02:26:59,920 --> 02:27:03,037
<i>...Cornwallis entrenched himself
at Yorktown, Virginia.</i>

1280
02:27:04,400 --> 02:27:06,675
<i>Washington escaped from the north...</i>

1281
02:27:06,880 --> 02:27:09,952
<i>...and surrounded Cornwallis,
who could not retreat to the seas.</i>

1282
02:27:10,280 --> 02:27:13,352
<i>It was blocked off by
our long-lost friends...</i>

1283
02:27:13,600 --> 02:27:15,955
<i>...who had finally arrived.</i>

1284
02:27:20,320 --> 02:27:21,673
<i>Vive la France.</i>

1285
02:27:24,280 --> 02:27:25,793
<i>Vive la libert.</i>

1286
02:27:37,480 --> 02:27:39,277
My lord, I beseech you.

1287
02:27:39,880 --> 02:27:42,030
You must order the surrender.

1288
02:27:42,840 --> 02:27:45,912
How could it come to this?
An army of rabble.

1289
02:27:46,520 --> 02:27:47,873
Peasants.

1290
02:27:49,960 --> 02:27:51,837
Everything will change.

1291
02:27:55,200 --> 02:27:57,111
Everything has changed.

1292
02:27:57,880 --> 02:27:59,836
<i>Though he eventually surrendered...</i>

1293
02:28:00,040 --> 02:28:02,395
<i>...Cornwallis himself hid in shame...</i>

1294
02:28:02,600 --> 02:28:06,036
<i>...appointing his subordinate to
relinquish his sword.</i>

1295
02:28:07,200 --> 02:28:10,192
<i>With the war ending,
and our militia disbanding...</i>

1296
02:28:10,400 --> 02:28:12,960
<i>...I take measure of what
we have lost...</i>

1297
02:28:13,160 --> 02:28:14,639
<i>...and what we have won.</i>

1298
02:28:15,760 --> 02:28:20,276
<i>My hope and prayer is that
the sacrifices borne by so many...</i>

1299
02:28:20,520 --> 02:28:24,195
<i>...will spawn and fulfill the promise
of our new nation.</i>

1300
02:28:25,560 --> 02:28:29,314
<i>Tell the children, and especially
Susan, that I will keep my promise...</i>

1301
02:28:29,520 --> 02:28:32,990
<i>...as I will be returning
to you all soon.</i>

1302
02:28:38,880 --> 02:28:40,472
Where will you go now?

1303
02:28:41,200 --> 02:28:43,350
Home. Start over.

02:28:43,600 --> 02:28:45,830
Your wife's expecting a child,
isn't she?

1305
02:28:46,040 --> 02:28:48,679
She gave birth to a son
three weeks ago.

1306
02:28:49,800 --> 02:28:51,119
What'd you name him?

1307
02:28:53,120 --> 02:28:55,031
We named him GabrieI.

1308
02:29:00,400 --> 02:29:01,389
Thank you, Harry.

1309
02:29:08,320 --> 02:29:10,959
GabrieI is a good name for a farmer.

1310
02:29:11,400 --> 02:29:13,709
It is. It is.

1311
02:29:14,240 --> 02:29:15,309
Jean.

1312
02:29:15,560 --> 02:29:16,515
Ben.

1313
02:30:21,200 --> 02:30:23,794
GabrieI said if we won the war...

1314
02:30:24,160 --> 02:30:26,037
...we could build a whole new world.

1315
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,673
Just figured we'd get started
right here...

1316
02:30:31,040 --> 02:30:32,678
...with your home.

1317
02:30:36,520 --> 02:30:37,873
Sounds good.

1318
02:30:41,200 --> 02:30:42,155
Thank you.

1319
02:38:00,720 --> 02:38:01,709
