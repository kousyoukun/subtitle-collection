1
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:07,090
我长久以来的恐惧…
I have long feared...

2
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,510
就是我旧日的罪愆会回来纠缠我
...that my sins would return to visit me.

3
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,340
代价之高，我无法承受
And the cost is more than I can bear.

4
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:22,900
决战　　  时刻

5
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,670
山缪！信差来了！
Samuel! A postrider!

6
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,800
“R” An "R."

7
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,220
很好
Good.

8
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,230
这个呢？
What about this one?

9
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,640
谢谢　　不客气
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

10
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,600
爸爸…
Father! Father!

11
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,940
9磅，11盎司，好极了
Nine pounds, eleven ounces. That's perfect. Perfect.

12
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,490
爸爸，有信差！
Father, a postrider!

13
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,100
你南田的种子种好了吗？
Did you finish planting the field?

14
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,160
种好一半多了
More than half.

15
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:43,440
偷偷去游泳，浪费了一些时间吧？
Those swimming breaks really cut into the day, don't they?

16
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,330
告诉你了吧
Told you.

17
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,010
托马斯
Thomas.

18
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,590
等爸爸
Wait for Father.

19
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,650
对不起
Sorry.

20
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:07,280
1776年，南卡罗莱纳州

21
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:31,390
伊丽莎白・普顿・马汀之墓 卒于1773年2月18日，享年35岁

22
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,570
那就是了，北极星
That's her. The North Star.

23
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,070
看到了吗？
See?

24
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,300
你要从北斗七星的最前面两颗星开始看
You start from the front two stars of the Big Dipper.

25
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,780
然后往上数
And then you count up.

26
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:48,240
数到五指的宽度时…
You count up five finger lengths...

27
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,160
就在那儿了
...and it's right there.

28
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,330
它会一直俯视着我们
And she'll always be looking down on us.

29
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,750
永远保护我们
And protect us. Forever.

30
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,340
来，睡觉了
Come. Into bed.

31
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,390
晚安，晚安，梅格
Good night. Good night, Meg.

32
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,860
让她知道妈在那儿会好得多
It helps her to know Mother's there.

33
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,440
晚安
Good night.

34
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,490
邮件里有什么？
So what was in the mail?

35
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,710
纽约州和宾夕法尼亚的议会…
"The New York and Pennsylvania assemblies...

36
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,170
在辩论独立事宜
...are debating independence."

37
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,920
中部的殖民地呢？
What about the middle colonies?

38
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,850
在切斯特城，他们烧毁了海关
"In Chestertown, they burned the customs house...

39
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,350
严惩了两名官员
...and tar and feathered two magistrates.

40
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,020
他们被烧死
They died of... They died of burns."

41
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,270
真是蠢货
Damn fools.

42
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,390
你是说谁？作者还是那两个官员？
Who? The writers or the magistrates?

43
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,400
有没谈及大陆会议的事？
What does it say about the Continental Congress?

44
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,700
上面说会在七月宣布独立
It says here they'll make a declaration of independence by July.

45
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,180
彼德・库本加入独立军了
Peter Cuppin joined the Continentals.

46
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,980
他才十七，比我还小一岁
He's 17, a year younger than I.

47
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,790
国民大会开会，我被叫到查理士城去了
Well, the assembly's been convened, so I've been called to Charles Town.

48
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:38,000
我们要去查理士城？　对
- We're going to Charles Town? - We are.

49
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,620
我们明早就动身
We leave in the morning.

50
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,790
夏绿蒂
Charlotte.

51
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,960
孩子在这里
The children are here.

52
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,170
谢谢你
Thank you.

53
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,310
夏绿蒂阿姨！
Aunt Charlotte!

54
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,390
玛格莉特，威廉，看看你们
Margaret, William, look at you.

55
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,940
好想你
Missed you.

56
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:47,120
他们长得好大，你给他们吃了什么啊？
They're huge. What have you been feeding them?

57
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,650
他们的种好，因为是遗传自母亲
Well, they're from good stock. On their mother's side, of course.

58
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,160
谢谢，进来吧，我有不少好东西
Thank you. Come inside. Wait until you see what I have.

59
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,950
给我们的礼物？　慢慢来
- Presents? Presents for us? - Move slowly.

60
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,620
你们看好那些野蛮人，好吗？
Keep an eye on these heathens, will you?

61
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,120
对不起
Sorry.

62
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,350
我帮你准备了这个，苏珊，是你妈的
I have this for you, Susan. It belonged to your mother.

63
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,560
她还是不开口？
She's still not talking?

64
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,400
没错
No.

65
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,110
看到你，我的感觉真好
It does me good to see you.

66
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,050
看，那是佳百列
Look, there's Gabriel.

67
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,340
佳百列
Gabriel.

68
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,470
吊死乔治国王！
Hang King George!

69
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,650
哈利・布尔在招兵
Harry Burwell is here recruiting.

70
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,860
州长已经发誓，如果议会给大陆军
The governor has vowed if the assembly votes a single shilling...

71
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,860
支持一分钱，就会解散议会
...to the Continental Army, he'll dissolve the body.

72
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,250
那是否使我们在宾州的代表…
Wouldn't that force our delegates in Philadelphia

73
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,450
一定要投独立的票？
to vote for independence?

74
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,450
是的
Yes.

75
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,710
使我们在麻省附近发生战争
Send us off to war alongside Massachusetts.

76
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,800
处死乔治国王！
Get King George!

77
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:38,450
把他们全都吊死！　一个都不要放过！
- Hang them all! - Hang the lot of them!

78
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,100
够了，很好，孩子，进去吧
That's enough. Very well, children, inside.

79
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:44,640
走吧，进去
Come along now. Inside now.

80
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,740
布尔指靠你的选票
Burwell will be counting on your vote.

81
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,280
他希望成为第一个当选的人
And he'll expect you to be the first to enlist.

82
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,160
是的，我想是
Yes, I imagine so.

83
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,620
对不起，这些野蛮人是…
I'm sorry, the heathens are...

84
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,750
他们非常渴望一个女人
They have long needed a woman in their lives.

85
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,300
一个妈妈
A mother.

86
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,760
特别是苏珊
Especially Susan.

87
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,560
我是彼得・霍尔
My name is Peter Howard.

88
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:36,130
我丧失了大部份的听力和我的左腿…
I lost most of my hearing and my left leg...

89
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:40,310
全都是为了法国和印第安人之间的战事
...fighting for the Crown in the French and Indian War.

90
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,030
乔治国王是怎么报答我的？
And how did King George reward me?

91
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,040
他用税废了我另一条腿
He cuts off my other leg with his taxes.

92
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,290
是你吗，霍华小姐？
Miss Howard, isn't it?

93
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,420
你知道我是谁，佳百列・马汀
You know who I am, Gabriel Martin.

94
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,300
我们最后一次见面，我才11岁
The last time you saw me, I was 11

95
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,450
你在我茶中加了墨水
and you put ink in my tea.

96
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:03,480
那应该是我弟弟吧，也许是山缪或纳森
I believe that was one of my younger brothers. Perhaps Samuel or Nathan.

97
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,810
是你，那让我的牙齿黑了一个月
It was you, and it turned my teeth black for a month.

98
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:16,150
我们就给乔治国王一个永生难忘的教训吧
- And send a message to King George he will never forget!

99
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,820
我们的第一个议题
Our first order of business...

100
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,450
也是最后的，让我们来投票表决征兵！
And our last, if we vote a levy!

101
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,530
安静…！
Order, order!

102
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,740
西门斯先生，你没有发言权
Mr. Simms, you do not have the floor.

103
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,400
首先是哈利・布尔上校对独立军的演说
First, an address by Colonel Harry Burwell of the Continental Army.

104
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:30,790
布尔上校
Colonel Burwell.

105
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,750
大家都知道我为什么来这儿
You all know why I'm here.

106
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,010
我不是个演说家
I'm not an orator.

107
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,970
我也不想说服大家接受我们作战的理由
And I would not try to convince you of the worthiness of our cause.

108
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,850
我是个军人
I'm a soldier.

109
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,770
我们正在作战
And we are at war.

110
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,940
我们在等宾州发表独立宣言
From Philadelphia, we expect a declaration of independence.

111
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:57,270
13个州中有8个州都决定出资…
8 of the 13 colonies have levied money...

112
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,610
赞助独立军
...in support of a continental army.

113
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,280
我希望南卡能够成为第9个州
I ask that South Carolina be the ninth.

114
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:06,160
麻州和维吉尼亚州也许在打仗…
Massachusetts and Virginia may be at war...

115
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,540
但是南卡不是！
...but South Carolina is not!

116
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,790
赞成…
Hear, hear.

117
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,470
这一场战争不是为争取一两个州的独立…
This is not a war for the independence of one or two colonies...

118
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,710
而是争取整个国家的独立
...but for the independence of one nation.

119
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,960
哪个国家呢？
And what nation is that?

120
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:21,420
美国！
An American nation!

121
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:24,180
没有这个国家，这么说是叛国
There is no such nation and to speak of one is treason.

122
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:27,300
我们是美国的国民
We are citizens of an American nation.

123
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,220
我们的权利却受到三千英哩外…
And our rights are being threatened...

124
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,980
暴君的威胁
...by a tyrant 3000 miles away.

125
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,650
霍华先生，请告诉我
Would you tell me, please, Mr. Howard...

126
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:39,780
我为什么要用三千哩外的暴君…
...why should I trade one tyrant 3000 miles away...

127
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,900
来换一英哩外的三千个暴君？
...for 3000 tyrants one mile away?

128
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,160
民选国会也能像国王一样
An elected legislature can trample

129
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,460
践踏我们的人权
a man's rights as easily as a king can.

130
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,710
马汀上尉…
Captain Martin...

131
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,960
我知道你很爱国
...I understood you to be a patriot.

132
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,250
如果你想知道我是否因遭重税而愤愤不平？
If you mean by "patriot," am I angry about taxation without representation?

133
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,590
是的，我很生气
Well, yes, I am.

134
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,970
美国是否该独立自主？
Should the American colonies govern themselves independently?

135
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:12,140
我认为他们可以也应该
I believe they can. And they should.

136
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:16,600
但若你问我是否该跟英国宣战…
But if you're asking me am I willing to go to war with England...

137
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,440
我的答复是否定的
...then the answer is most definitely no.

138
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:28,200
难道这就是在英法战争时…
This from the same Captain Benjamin Martin whose fury was so famous...

139
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,490
怒气勃发的马汀上尉说的话吗？
...during the Wilderness campaign?

140
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,700
当年我年少轻狂
I was intemperate in my youth.

141
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,830
节制很可能是恐惧的伪装
Temperance can be a disguise for fear.

142
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,500
米德顿先生，我和马汀上尉…
Mr. Middleton, I fought with Captain Martin...

143
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,380
一起在华盛顿将军的麾下打过仗
...under Washington in the French and Indian War.

144
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,670
这屋里没有任何人…
There's not a man in this room...

145
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,090
比他还值得我信任的
...or anywhere for that matter, to whom I would more willingly trust my life.

146
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,310
除了战争还有别的选择
There are alternatives to war.

147
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,560
我们可以向国王陈情
We take our case before the king.

148
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,230
我们可以跟他讲理　　我们试过了
- We plead with him. - We tried.

149
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,440
那我们应一试再试，极力避免战争
Well, then, we try again and again if necessary to avoid a war.

150
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,940
我参加过邦克山之役
I was at Bunker Hill.

151
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,860
英军推进了三次
The British advanced three times.

152
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,350
我们近距离杀了七百名英军
We killed 700 at point-blank range

153
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,460
但他们仍然攻下邦克山
and still they took the ground.

154
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,450
这是他们解决的方式
That is the measure of their resolve.

155
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,750
如果你的原则是坚持独立…
If your principles dictate independence...

156
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:20,290
那唯有作战一途
...then war is the only way.

157
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,380
战争是无法避免的
It is come to that.

158
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,090
对…
Hear, hear.

159
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:28,090
我有七个小孩
I have seven children.

160
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,340
内人已死
My wife is dead.

161
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,390
我去作战谁来照顾他们？
Now, who's to care for them if I go to war?

162
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:40,190
不光是没有小孩的男人才去作战
Wars are not fought only by childless men.

163
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,060
同意
Granted.

164
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,940
但请记下我的话
But mark my words.

165
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:53,120
这场战争将不是在前线进行…
This war will be fought, not on the frontier...

166
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,120
也不是在遥远的战场…
...or on some distant battlefield...

167
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,790
战火会在身边燃烧
...but amongst us.

168
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,960
在我们的家中燃烧
Among our homes.

169
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:06,130
我们的孩子们将会亲身体验战争的可怕
Our children will learn of it with their own eyes.

170
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:11,010
他们的童真将会和我们一起死去
And the innocent will die with the rest of us.

171
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,600
我不参战
I will not fight.

172
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,630
正因为如此，我不打算参与投票…
And because I will not fight, I will not cast a vote...

173
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,400
将别人送上战场
...that will send others to fight in my stead.

174
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:27,610
你的原则呢？
And your principles?

175
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:35,320
我是有孩子的人，我没有讲原则的权利
I'm a parent. I haven't got the luxury of principles.

176
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,130
我们一定要投票赞成征兵！
We must vote to levy!

177
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,100
28比l2！征兵通过了！
28 to 12! The levy passed!

178
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,220
你打算擅自入伍？
You intend to enlist without my permission?

179
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,300
是的
Yes, I do.

180
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:46,400
父亲，我还以为你是个有原则的人
Father, I thought you were a man of principle.

181
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:53,200
你有家室后自会明白
When you have a family of your own, perhaps you'll understand.

182
00:18:55,910 --> 00:19:00,080
我有家室，也不会用他们来当挡箭牌
When I have a family of my own, I won't hide behind them.

183
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:19,180
他像他父亲小时候一样鲁莽
He's as imprudent as his father was at his age.

184
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,220
恐怕是这样
Regrettably so.

185
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:26,730
我会尽量将他收在我的羽翼之下
I'll see to it that he serves under me.

186
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:31,440
我叫他去做文官，或补给官之类的
Make him a clerk or quartermaster, something of that sort.

187
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,900
祝你好运
Good luck.

188
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,350
亲爱的托马斯，虽然过了许多年…
Dear Thomas: Though many seasons have passed...

189
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:07,410
但在查理士城见面，仿佛是昨日的事
...it seems like only yesterday when we last saw each other in Charles Town.

190
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,800
很遗憾听说，英军在康瓦理斯将军指挥下…
With sadness, I learned of its recent fall to the British...

191
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,440
打败我们的消息
...under General Cornwallis.

192
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,610
我今天接到夏绿蒂阿姨的信…
I received a letter from Aunt Charlotte...

193
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,280
告诉我…她在查理士城沦陷后锁上家门…
...saying she closed her home in Charles Town after the city fell...

194
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:25,370
然后搬到山提河畔的农场
...and moved to her plantation on the Santee.

195
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:40,300
在北边我们弹尽粮绝
Here in the north, our campaign has been marked by defeat and privation.

196
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:44,140
我们伤亡惨重
Our losses have been grievous.

197
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:55,390
我的好友彼德・库本，在伊丽莎白镇战死
My good friend, Peter Cuppin, fell at Elizabethtown.

198
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:04,160
他的死讯让我伤痛欲绝
His death has been difficult to bear.

199
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:19,510
我们即将和盖兹将军南进…
We will march south with General Gates...

200
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,550
和康瓦理斯将军的红衫军对决
...to fight the Redcoats under Cornwallis.

201
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,680
谢谢你，长官
Thank you, sir.

202
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,110
我羡慕你…
I envy you...

203
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,430
我羡慕你和战争毫无瓜葛
...your youth and distance from this cruel conflict of

204
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:47,830
而我却是这场战争的一部份
 which I am a part.

205
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:52,080
但我觉得，自己有幸能够为自由而战
"But I am fortunate to be serving the cause of Liberty.

206
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,460
虽然我畏惧死亡…
And though I fear death...

207
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:57,620
但每天我都祈祷，我在必要时…
...each day in prayer I reaffirm my willingness...

208
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,840
能为自由捐躯
...to give my life in its service.

209
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,930
为我祷告
Pray for me.

210
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,970
为争取自由而祷告
But above all, pray for the cause.

211
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,970
爱你的哥哥，佳百列上
Your loving brother, Gabriel."

212
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,260
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

213
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,310
转身
Turn around.

214
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,320
现在还不行，托马斯
Not yet, Thomas.

215
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,780
那什么时候？
When?

216
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:08,950
等你17岁
Seventeen.

217
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,490
那还要两年，我已经等了两年
That's two years. It's already been two.

218
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:17,580
到时战争说不定结束了　　老天保佑
- The war could be over by then. - God willing.

219
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,550
17岁就17岁
All right. Seventeen.

220
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,180
好
All right.

221
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,230
请放回去
Put it back, please.

222
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,860
父亲？
Father?

223
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,410
威尔德尼斯堡发生了什么事？
What happened at Fort Wilderness?

224
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,950
收好
Put it away.

225
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,420
扔远一点　　你扔远一点，你来
- Throw it faster. - You throw it faster. You're the one...

226
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:16,480
玛格莉特，你让弟弟马上回来这里
Margaret, you go get your brothers back up here right now.

227
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,540
回屋去，快
Back to the house. Come on. Back to the house now.

228
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,800
跟我来，玛格莉特，快
Come with me. Margaret, go now.

229
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,390
他们快来了
They're going to come.

230
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,480
静点，坐下
Quiet. Sit down.

231
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:13,640
六磅炮
Six-pounders.

232
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,140
好多
Lots of them.

233
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,390
有多远？
How far away?

234
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:22,310
还远着呢，看来是瞄准别的方向
They're a long way off. They're most likely heading the other direction.

235
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,730
把枪收进去
Put those in the house.

236
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:29,690
他们可能朝这里来　　要我再说一遍吗？
- They might come this way. - Must I tell you again?

237
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,070
我们全躲在家里，懂吗？
Let's all stay close in to the house, all right?

238
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,640
我们要赶走英军
We'll have to fight them off.

239
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:58,720
父亲不会这么做吗？
Won't Father do that?

240
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:02,140
他们也许会杀了我们男人…
They'll probably kill us men...

241
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,150
凌虐你们女生
...and do Lord-knows-what to you women.

242
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,980
纳森！
Nathan!

243
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,840
慢慢转过来
Slowly turn.

244
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,640
父亲
Father.

245
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,230
艾比佳！
Abigale!

246
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,650
快去拿水和绷带
Water and bandages, fast.

247
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,190
你有在作战现场吗？
The battle. Were you there?

248
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,450
你有看见红衫军吗？
Have you seen any Redcoats?

249
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,240
还没有
No, not yet.

250
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:00,990
艾比佳，快去照顾孩子们
Abigale, the children, please.

251
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:03,660
孩子们，跟我上楼
Children, come. Upstairs.

252
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,840
盖兹带着我们直捣红衫军黄龙
Gates marched us straight at the Redcoats.

253
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:16,000
我们的防线失散了，被英军打得溃不成军
Our lines broke. The British Green Dragoons cut us to bits.

254
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:18,260
上级给我这些急件
I was given these dispatches.

255
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:23,430
我离开时，看到维吉尼亚正规军投降
As I left, I saw the Virginia Regulars surrender.

256
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,560
英军长驱直入
The Dragoons rode into them.

257
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,310
把他们杀光了
Killed them all.

258
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,320
两百多个人
Over 200 men.

259
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,610
我一定要把这些急件送到西尔斯堡
I have to get these dispatches to Hillsborough.

260
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:37,980
你不能骑马
You can't ride.

261
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:41,240
我不能留在这，我在这里会危及…
I can't stay here! It's not safe for...

262
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:15,070
开火！
Fire!

263
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:24,870
开火！
Fire!

264
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,060
谢谢你们照顾国王的士兵
Thank you for the care of His Majesty's soldiers.

265
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,340
中尉，派一队人马送伤兵去看医生
Have a detachment take our wounded to our surgeons at Winnsboro.

266
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,970
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

267
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,010
放火烧了那栋房子和谷仓
Fire the house and barns.

268
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:36,440
你们要是敢窝藏敌军，就会无家可归
Let it be known if you harbour the enemy you will lose your home.

269
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:41,610
乔治国王有令…
By order of King George...

270
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:45,240
任何只要为英国效力的美国奴隶
...all slaves of the American colonies who fight for the Crown...

271
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,860
只要我们战胜就能成为自由之身
...will be granted their freedom with our victory.

272
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:54,450
我们不是奴隶，是在这工作的自由人
We're not slaves. We work this land. We're freedmen.

273
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:57,750
那各位就是有幸为…
Then you're freedmen who will have the privilege...

274
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,130
英国军队效力的自由人了
...of fighting in the king's army.

275
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,880
敌军的快递，长官
Rebel dispatches, sir.

276
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,720
这是谁的？
Who carried this?

277
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,940
谁的？！
Who carried this?!

278
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:28,030
我的
I did, sir.

279
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,910
我受伤了，这些人照顾我
I was wounded. These people gave me care.

280
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,330
他们和这些密令没有关系
They have nothing to do with the dispatches.

281
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:45,170
带他去坎登，他是间谍
Take this one to Camden. He is a spy.

282
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,550
吊死他，尸首示众
Hang him, put his body on display.

283
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:49,930
他是个传令兵
He's a dispatch rider.

284
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,840
杀了活口把马留给英军
Destroy the livestock. Save the horses for the Dragoons.

285
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,430
上校，他是带着密令的制服传令兵
Colonel, this is a uniformed dispatch rider carrying a marked case.

286
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,980
他不能被视为间谍
He cannot be held as a spy.

287
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,900
我们不打算关他，我们要吊死他
Well, we won't hold him. We're going to hang him.

288
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,030
上校…　父亲！
- Colonel... - Father!

289
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:13,410
我懂了，他是你儿子
Oh, I see. He's your son.

290
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:17,290
也许你该教他什么叫做爱国
Perhaps you should've taught him something of loyalty.

291
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:22,830
上校，我求你根据作战时的规定…
Colonel, I beg you, please reconsider. By the rules of war...

292
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,630
你想知道什么叫作战规则吗？
Would you like a lesson, sir, in the rules of war?

293
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,260
也许你的小孩想上一课
Or perhaps your children would.

294
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:37,890
无此必要
No lesson is necessary.

295
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,060
长官
Sir.

296
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:44,150
那些受伤的叛军怎么办？
What of the rebel wounded?

297
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:47,900
杀了他们
Kill them.

298
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:53,950
父亲
Father.

299
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,790
父亲，快想想办法！
Father, do something!

300
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,080
安静！
Be quiet!

301
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,760
佳百列，快跑！
Gabriel, run!

302
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:17,890
等等！
Wait!

303
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,890
不！！
No!!

304
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,340
愚蠢的孩子
Stupid boy.

305
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,590
上尉
Captain.

306
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:04,230
托马斯！
Thomas!

307
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:00,950
来吧，孩子
Come, child.

308
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:05,200
不　　我不会留下这些孩子！
I'm not leaving these children!

309
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:06,790
手下留情！
Mercy!

310
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,580
准备！
Get ready!

311
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:10,750
举枪！
Present!

312
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,040
开火！
Fire!

313
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,670
你们都留在这里
All of you, stay here.

314
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,540
纳森，山缪
Nathan, Samuel.

315
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,510
玛格莉特
Margaret.

316
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:45,470
我要你们带着威廉和苏珊躲在田里
Hide in the fields with William and Susan.

317
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,520
若我黄昏时没回来，就去找夏绿蒂阿姨
If we're not back by sunset, take them to Aunt Charlotte's.

318
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,060
懂了吗？
- Is that clear? - Yeah.

319
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:52,810
孩子们
Boys.

320
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,450
这个地点不错
It's a good spot.

321
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:50,990
孩子们，听我说
Boys, listen to me.

322
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,210
我先开枪
I'll fire first.

323
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:58,210
我要你们先开枪打军官，再打士兵
Start with the officers and work your way down.

324
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,090
你们知道哪些是军官吧？
Can you tell the difference?

325
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,130
知道，父亲
Yes, Father.

326
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:03,220
知道　　很好
- Yes, Father. - Good.

327
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:07,540
山缪，在你开第一枪后就帮纳森装子弹
Samuel, after your first shot, reload for Nathan.

328
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,640
现在…
Now...

329
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:11,860
万一我有个三长两短，我要你们放下武器
...if anything should happen to me, drop your weapons.

330
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:13,520
能跑多快就跑多快
Run as quickly as you can.

331
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,230
回家去找弟弟，妹妹…
Get your brother and your sisters...

332
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,190
带他们去夏绿蒂阿姨家，懂吗？
...and take them to Aunt Charlotte's. Understood?

333
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:22,360
还记得我教你们怎么开枪吗？
What did I say about shooting?

334
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,070
瞄小目标失误就少
Aim small, miss small.

335
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:26,360
瞄小目标失误就少
Aim small, miss small.

336
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:28,740
孩子们…
Boys...

337
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,580
山缪…
...Samuel...

338
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,290
不要慌
...steady.

339
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:22,290
上帝，保佑我又快又准
Lord, make me fast and accurate.

340
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,220
瞄小目标失误就少
Aim small, miss small.

341
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:29,220
瞄小目标失误就少
Aim small, miss small.

342
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:32,180
瞄小目标失误就少
Aim small, miss small.

343
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,490
上面，在右边！　在左边！
- On the right! - To the left!

344
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,830
在后面！
Behind us! Up on the ridge!

345
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:01,670
从右边来的！
Form right!

346
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:04,670
右转！
To the right!

347
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,170
向后转！
About face!

348
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:12,510
在右边的山上！
On the right to the rear!

349
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:15,350
向右转！
To the right!

350
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:16,520
开火！
Fire!

351
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,810
装子弹！　装子弹！
- Reload! - Reload!

352
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,500
在后面！
Behind you!

353
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,920
注意后面！
Look on the rear!

354
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:15,940
上帝
Lord...

355
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:19,900
我们祈祷您接受这个孩子
...we pray that you accept this child...

356
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:23,070
让他和他妈留在您身边
...and keep him at your side with his mother.

357
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,990
我们请求你收留他
We ask that you embrace him...

358
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:33,670
帮助我们理解你的仁慈
...and help us to understand the manner in which your mercy works.

359
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:37,000
原谅我们的罪行
And forgive us our sins.

360
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:40,340
我们以您的名义祈祷
This we ask in your name.

361
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:42,300
阿门
Amen.

362
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,160
我们印地安斥候带回来的二等兵
Sir, we have the private the Cherokee scouts brought in.

363
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:23,050
二等兵？
Private?

364
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:24,340
二等兵
Private.

365
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:27,450
我是青龙部队的威廉・塔维顿上校
Colonel William Tavington, Green Dragoons.

366
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:29,760
怎么了？谁干的好事？
What happened? Who did this?

367
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:31,770
他
Him.

368
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:34,520
当时情况一团乱
It was mad.

369
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:37,020
我也说不上来是谁干的
I couldn't tell you who it was.

370
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:39,310
冷静点…
Calm down. Calm down, man.

371
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:42,820
我们损失了20名皇家士兵
Twenty of His Majesty's soldiers are dead.

372
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:45,400
我要知道是怎么回事
And I need to know how.

373
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:47,700
他说有…　你在场吗？
- He said there was... - Were you there?

374
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,330
那就让他说
Then let him speak.

375
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:54,330
慢慢来，告诉我有多少人？
Take your time and tell me. How many were there?

376
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:56,460
是民兵吗？还是正规军？
Were they militia? Were they Regulars?

377
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,170
我不记得有多少人
I don't really remember how many.

378
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:02,840
也许只有一个
Maybe one.

379
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:07,510
一个人，真的吗？
One man. Really?

380
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:09,600
他在侧面攻击
He was in the flank.

381
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:12,720
似乎在我们周边游走
All around us.

382
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,600
又仿佛在我们之间
Amongst us.

383
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:17,810
他来无影去无踪，我几乎看不到他
I could barely see him. He was there, then he was gone.

384
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:19,610
他就这样消失了
He just vanished.

385
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:23,150
听起来像鬼不像人
Sounds more like a ghost than a man.

386
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:25,110
鬼
A ghost.

387
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:28,280
他是很像鬼
He was like a ghost.

388
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:31,200
够了
Enough.

389
00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:36,040
波顿？带一队侦察队
Bordon? Take a patrol.

390
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:39,410
看看能不能在消息传开前抓到这个鬼
Capture this ghost before word of his exploits spread.

391
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:42,340
这是谁？　他是威尔金上尉
- Who's this? - Sir, this is Captain Wilkins.

392
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:46,450
他曾是英国民兵，说不定派得上用场
He was with the Loyalist Colonial Militia. He might be of use.

393
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:48,180
又一个殖民地居民
Another colonial.

394
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,300
威尔金上尉，你忠于哪一方？
Captain Wilkins, where do your loyalties lie?

395
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:52,680
我忠于英王和祖国
To king and country.

396
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:56,270
我为什么要信任一个出卖邻居的人？
Why should I trust a man who'd betray his neighbours?

397
00:49:56,310 --> 00:49:59,310
我那些出卖英国的邻居…
Those neighbours of mine who stand against England...

398
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,270
罪该万死
...deserve to die a traitor's death.

399
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,440
咱们走着瞧吧
We'll see.

400
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:11,110
马汀先生！
Mr. Martin!

401
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,210
夏绿蒂小姐…！
Miss Charlotte!

402
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:33,640
你们安全了，睡吧
You're safe now. Try to sleep.

403
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:35,100
晚安
Good night.

404
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:36,560
晚安
Good night.

405
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:38,520
父亲？
Father?

406
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:40,020
什么事？
Yes.

407
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:43,110
我杀了那些人
I killed those men.

408
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,820
你只是照我的话去做
You did what I told you to do.

409
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,360
那是你该做的，这没什么不对
You did what you had to. There was no wrong in it.

410
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:54,910
我很高兴杀了他们
I'm glad I killed them.

411
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:00,120
我真的很高兴
I'm glad.

412
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:11,470
睡吧
Get some rest.

413
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:20,480
山缪
Samuel.

414
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:45,340
你做了…没什么好觉得羞耻的事
You've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.

415
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:48,000
我什么都没做
I've done nothing.

416
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,840
所以我很羞愧
And for that, I am ashamed.

417
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,550
我们要去圣海伦纳
We'll go to Saint Helena.

418
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:38,140
在查理士城南边，是个自由奴隶岛
That's a free slave island just north of Charles Town.

419
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:40,760
就在英国人的眼皮底下
Right under the British noses.

420
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:44,270
他们不会想…　我要去加入他们
- They won't think of look... - I'm joining up with them.

421
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:46,480
佳百列
Gabriel.

422
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,610
不，你得留在这里
No. Your place is here now.

423
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:53,740
我要回去，我是个军人，这是我的职责
I'm going back. I'm a soldier, it's my duty.

424
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:55,860
你要对你的家庭负责
Your duty is to your family.

425
00:52:57,610 --> 00:52:59,490
不准你弃我于不顾！
Don't you walk away from me, boy!

426
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:01,030
战争结束后我会来找你们
I'll find you when it's over.

427
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,040
我不准你去！
No, I forbid you to go!

428
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:06,710
我不是个小孩！　你是我的小孩！
- I'm not a child! - You're my child!

429
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:09,840
再见，父亲
Goodbye, Father.

430
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,800
佳百列
Gabriel.

431
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:15,090
托马斯死了
Thomas is dead.

432
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:19,410
到底要死多少人，你才肯听我的话？
How many more have to die before you'll heed my word?

433
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:50,540
我在失去我的家人
I'm losing my family.

434
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:56,340
父亲，你什么时候会回来？
When will you be back, Father?

435
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:58,760
我不知道
I don't know.

436
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:00,510
明天吗？
Tomorrow?

437
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:02,600
不是明天
No, not tomorrow.

438
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:04,930
乖乖祷告
You say your prayers.

439
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:06,350
我会的
I will.

440
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:10,690
照顾弟弟、妹妹和夏绿蒂阿姨
Take care of your brothers and sisters and your Aunt Charlotte.

441
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:12,810
我只能靠你了
I'm depending on you.

442
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:15,690
还有你，山缪
As I am on you, Samuel.

443
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:18,240
好
All right.

444
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,450
苏珊
Susan...

445
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:29,960
再见
...goodbye.

446
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:46,140
谢谢！
Thank you.

447
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:55,640
停！
Halt!

448
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:01,480
准备！
Make ready!

449
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,950
瞄准！
Take aim!

450
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:13,750
开火！
Fire!

451
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,510
我不会回去的
I'm not going back.

452
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:30,430
我也没有指望你回去
No, I didn't expect you would.

453
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:37,310
那个盖兹是个傻瓜
That Gates is a damn fool.

454
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:41,570
他在英国部队混了太久
He spent too many years in the British army.

455
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:46,440
居然想在旷野中击败红衫军，真疯狂
Going muzzle-to-muzzle with Redcoats in open field. It's madness.

456
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:47,740
停！
Halt!

457
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,910
准备！
Make ready!

458
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:52,370
举枪！
Present!

459
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:54,660
开火！
Fire!

460
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:20,460
这场战争在开始前就结束了
This battle was over before it began.

461
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:30,990
撤退！
Retreat!

462
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:33,450
撤退！
Retreat!

463
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:43,090
这些乡巴佬真笨
These rustics are so inept.

464
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,960
差点害我们赢得毫无光彩
Nearly takes the honour out of victory.

465
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,050
差一点
Nearly.

466
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,820
大家好
Hello general, gentlemen.

467
00:59:12,030 --> 00:59:14,780
今天是陛下和英格兰的荣耀之日
A glorious day for His Majesty and England.

468
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:17,080
塔维顿上校
Colonel Tavington.

469
00:59:17,330 --> 00:59:20,210
总是太早
Always too early.

470
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:21,960
总是太渴求荣耀
Always too eager for glory.

471
00:59:23,290 --> 00:59:26,040
渴求胜利
For victory, my lord.

472
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:28,510
我相信我们已经占领了地方
I believe we took the field.

473
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:31,300
下次，你要等我的命令
Next time, you'll wait for my command.

474
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:36,460
塔维顿上校好像更喜欢听自己下的命令
It appears that Colonel Tavington prefers to follow his own commands.

475
00:59:36,510 --> 00:59:37,850
奥哈拉将军告诉我…
General O'Hara tells me...

476
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:41,850
你得了一个“屠夫”的称号
...you've earned the nickname "The Butcher" among the populous.

477
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:44,020
我们明天讨论
We'll discuss it tomorrow.

478
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,020
诸位，我的赞扬
Gentlemen, my compliments.

479
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:49,650
庆祝胜利　　说得好！
- To a victory. - Hear, hear.

480
00:59:59,910 --> 01:00:01,000
压住他
Hold him firm.

481
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:23,140
你们的指挥官呢？　在那个帐篷里
- Where's your commanding officer? - That tent there.

482
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,690
那是个失败的行动
It's a lost cause.

483
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:49,040
班杰明・马汀
Benjamin Martin.

484
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:51,210
我不想听训
I'm in no mood for a lecture.

485
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:53,880
你们的盖兹将军呢？
Where's your General Gates now?

486
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:58,390
有人看到他骑着马朝东南方走了
The last anyone saw, riding hard northeast...

487
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:02,360
他的属下在百码后…苦苦追赶
...his staff 100 yards behind, trying to catch up.

488
01:01:02,430 --> 01:01:04,140
现在由谁指挥？
So who's in command?

489
01:01:04,730 --> 01:01:05,940
我
I am.

490
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:08,440
我想
I think.

491
01:01:09,610 --> 01:01:10,980
你要下什么命令给我？
What are my orders?

492
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:19,070
班杰明，我们差一口气就输了
We're a breath away from losing this war, Benjamin.

493
01:01:21,910 --> 01:01:24,910
华盛顿在莫瑞斯镇重整军备
In the north, Washington is reeling from Morristown.

494
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,830
他在躲一万两千名红衫军
He's running and hiding from 12,000 Redcoats.

495
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:30,830
我们在南方的军队又被康瓦理斯打散了
In the south, Cornwallis has broken our back.

496
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:34,330
他攻陷查理士城时，俘掳了我们五千弟兄
Captured over 5000 of our troops when he took Charles Town.

497
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:38,430
他也击溃了唯一挡在他和纽约间的军队
And he destroyed the only army between him and New York.

498
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:42,830
我们无力阻挡他长驱直入击败华盛顿军队
Nothing will stop him from heading north to finish off Washington.

499
01:01:42,850 --> 01:01:44,840
除非想办法把康瓦理斯留在南方
Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the south

500
01:01:44,850 --> 01:01:47,300
直到法军抵达
till the French arrive.

501
01:01:47,850 --> 01:01:50,930
他们答应要派一支舰队和一万名士兵来
They've promised a fleet and 10,000 troops.

502
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:52,610
何时？
When?

503
01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:55,990
最快还要六个月
Six months at the earliest.

504
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,610
你相信法国人会言而有信？
You trust the French to keep their word?

505
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:00,160
那当然
Absolument.

506
01:02:02,530 --> 01:02:05,200
班杰明・马汀，这位是维伦少校
Benjamin Martin. Major Jean Villeneuve.

507
01:02:05,370 --> 01:02:09,020
他是法国第七步兵连的，来帮我们训练民兵
French Seventh Light Foot. He will help train the militia.

508
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:12,290
你是维尔德尼斯的英雄，久仰了
The hero of Fort Wilderness. Your reputation precedes you.

509
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:20,300
你真的想用民兵来阻止康瓦理斯推进？
You really expect to hold Cornwallis here using just militia?

510
01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:22,800
不是我，是你
Not me. You.

511
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:27,020
哈利，他们不是军人，是农民
They're not soldiers, they're farmers.

512
01:02:27,230 --> 01:02:29,900
让英军通过…对他们比较好
They'd be better off letting the British march through.

513
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:32,810
没错，但形势不允许
They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't.

514
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:35,900
康瓦理斯手下有多少人？
How many men does Cornwallis have?

515
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:38,320
八千名步兵
8000 infantry.

516
01:02:38,570 --> 01:02:40,820
六百名骑兵
Around 600 cavalry.

517
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,740
我任命你为上校
I'm giving you a field commission as a colonel.

518
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:47,040
长官，可以把我儿子派到我的部队吗？
Might I request that you transfer my son under my command?

519
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:48,580
长官，不，我…
Sir, no, I...

520
01:02:48,790 --> 01:02:50,120
就这么定了
That's done.

521
01:02:53,630 --> 01:02:54,710
谢谢
Thank you.

522
01:02:56,710 --> 01:02:58,550
上校，我已经当了两年兵
Colonel, I've been a soldier for two years.

523
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:01,390
我当过斥候骑兵，狙击兵，清道兵
As a scout, horseman, marksman, scavenger.

524
01:03:01,590 --> 01:03:04,140
是吗？　我在正规军比较有发展
- Is that so? - I'd be of better use with Regulars.

525
01:03:04,350 --> 01:03:06,470
你是从哪儿学会骑马，开枪的？
Where'd you learn all that riding, shooting, scavenging?

526
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:08,310
是我父亲教的
My father taught me.

527
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:11,940
他有没有教你如何谦虚？
Teach you any humility?

528
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:14,190
他试过，但我不受教
He tried. It didn't take.

529
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:19,280
他也教你认从这到查理士城的每条小路…
He also taught you every trail between here and Charles Town...

530
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,240
所以才会把你调过来
...which is why he transferred you.

531
01:03:21,950 --> 01:03:24,820
我们放话出去，我们从山提河南岸开始…
We'll put the word out. Start on the south side of...

532
01:03:24,830 --> 01:03:27,040
分头进行比较快
We'll cover more ground if we split up.

533
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:32,000
很好，下士
Very well, corporal.

534
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:34,300
你去哈利斯维尔、潘布克、维克菲尔德
You take Harrisville, Pembroke, Wakefield.

535
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:38,550
我从北边开始，到黑沼泽会合
I'll start on the north side. Meet at the mission in Black Swamp.

536
01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:43,640
下士
Corporal.

537
01:03:45,390 --> 01:03:46,890
小心点
Be careful.

538
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:50,350
遵命
Yes, sir.

539
01:03:55,310 --> 01:03:56,820
你有孩子吗？
You have children?

540
01:04:01,530 --> 01:04:02,910
法国人
French.

541
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:28,810
这从山上…
It skirts the mountain and then...

542
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:31,350
一直到这里的水边…
...extends down towards the headwater here...

543
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:35,150
跨越俄亥俄河
...and right across to the far bank of the Ohio River.

544
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:36,810
一共十万英亩
It's 100,000 acres.

545
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:39,360
好大一片土地啊
It's an imposing land grant, my lord.

546
01:04:39,410 --> 01:04:42,080
你可以自己成立一个小国家
You will be a country unto yourself.

547
01:04:45,790 --> 01:04:47,500
国王真的很大方
His Majesty is most generous.

548
01:04:50,290 --> 01:04:55,030
但是您在战争中的表现也当之无愧
Though your service in this war more than warrants such a gift.

549
01:04:55,090 --> 01:04:59,800
是的，国王对为他效命的人…
Yes, this is how His Majesty rewards those...

550
01:05:00,050 --> 01:05:02,100
就是这么大方
...who fight for him as gentlemen.

551
01:05:02,390 --> 01:05:06,430
我想我也有一天能得到奖赏吧
I dare to presume my own meagre contributions will be rewarded one day.

552
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,690
你想得太多了
You may presume too much.

553
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:12,900
国王看的不光是战争的结果…
His Majesty, like history, judges us by the outcome of the war...

554
01:05:13,190 --> 01:05:15,230
也很注重作战的过程
...and the manner in which it was fought.

555
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:20,150
我们为英国皇室打仗，就要有个作战的样子
We serve the Crown, and we must conduct ourselves accordingly.

556
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:22,200
我们要善待投降的士兵
Surrendering troops will be given quarter.

557
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:24,740
这种惨无人道的事必须停止！
These brutal tactics must stop!

558
01:05:25,410 --> 01:05:27,830
我百战百胜还不够吗？
Is it not enough that I have never lost a battle?

559
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:29,250
你为我作战…
You serve me...

560
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:33,750
你作战的方式会影响别人对我的看法！
...and the manner in which you serve me reflects upon me!

561
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:38,420
我以为像你这样的名门子弟…
I would've thought that a gentleman from a family as esteemed as yours...

562
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:40,010
应该了解这点才是
...would understand that.

563
01:05:42,010 --> 01:05:44,930
我父亲把我的遗产
My late father squandered any esteem in which we were held...

564
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:47,020
和自尊挥霍一空
...along with my inheritance.

565
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:53,110
打胜仗是我力争上游的方式
I advance myself only through victory.

566
01:05:53,310 --> 01:05:56,650
你要靠我的战功才能得利
You advance yourself only through my good graces.

567
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,400
殖民地的人民是我们的弟兄
These Colonials are our brethren.

568
01:06:00,650 --> 01:06:05,450
战争结束之后我们会重修旧好
And when this conflict is over, we will re-establish commerce with them.

569
01:06:05,950 --> 01:06:07,830
懂吗，上校？
Do you understand, colonel?

570
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:10,870
懂，大人
Perfectly, my lord.

571
01:06:53,790 --> 01:06:56,880
牧师，如你允许，我想宣布一件事
Reverend, with your permission, I'd like to make an announcement.

572
01:06:57,170 --> 01:07:00,210
年轻人，这是上帝的圣地
Young man, this is a house of God.

573
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:03,430
我了解，牧师，请容我道歉
I understand that, reverend. I apologize.

574
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:08,310
我们来召集南卡民兵
The South Carolina Militia is being called up.

575
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:10,560
有志加入的人请来我这儿登记
I'm here to enlist every man willing.

576
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:12,810
年轻人…
Son...

577
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,310
我们在这里
...we are here to pray...

578
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:18,400
为在外面被吊死的人祷告
...for the souls of those men hanging outside.

579
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:20,480
为他们祷告吧
Yes, pray for them.

580
01:07:20,730 --> 01:07:23,030
但加入我们不要让他们白死
But honour them by taking up arms with us.

581
01:07:24,860 --> 01:07:26,910
让人民吃更多苦？
And bring more suffering to this town?

582
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:31,450
如果英王乔治能吊死那些人 他就能吊死我们
If King George can hang those men, he can hang any one of us.

583
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,170
丹史考特…
Dan Scott...

584
01:07:34,370 --> 01:07:37,840
一周前，你大赞独立自主两小时
...barely a week ago you railed for two hours about independence.

585
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:43,050
哈伟先生，你在我家提及过
Mr. Hardwick, how many times have I heard you...

586
01:07:43,470 --> 01:07:46,010
多少次自由？
...speak of freedom at my father's table?

587
01:07:47,550 --> 01:07:50,890
这里半数的人包括你父亲…
Half the men in this church, including you, Father...

588
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:53,930
和你，牧师…
...and you, reverend...

589
01:07:54,390 --> 01:07:57,350
都和我一样爱国
...are as ardent patriots as I.

590
01:08:02,030 --> 01:08:06,490
你们现在却只敢空谈吗？
Will you now, when you are needed most, stop at only words?

591
01:08:06,990 --> 01:08:08,780
你们是这种人吗？
Is that the sort of men you are?

592
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:20,590
我要求你们起而行…
I ask only that you act upon the beliefs...

593
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:23,710
贯彻你们的理念…
...of which you have so strongly spoken...

594
01:08:24,670 --> 01:08:27,760
为你们的信仰奋斗
...and in which you so strongly believe.

595
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:41,400
谁要加入我们？
Who's with us?

596
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:44,250
霍华先生
Mr. Howard.

597
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:46,460
先生…
Sir...

598
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:49,180
我可以写信给安吗？
...may I have permission to write to Anne?

599
01:09:53,010 --> 01:09:56,180
我可以写信给安吗？　可以
- May I have permission to write Anne? - Yes.

600
01:09:57,180 --> 01:09:58,600
你可以…
You have permission...

601
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:01,020
写信给我
...to write me.

602
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:03,360
写给她
Oh, write her.

603
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:06,190
很好
Very well.

604
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:09,400
谢谢你，先生
Thank you, sir.

605
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:13,200
牧师？
Reverend?

606
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:22,210
牧羊人要保护他的羊群
A shepherd must tend his flock.

607
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:26,750
有时要赶走野狼
And, at times, fight off the wolves.

608
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:09,880
你确定这是合适的地方去找民兵吗？
Are you sure this is the right place to recruit for a militia?

609
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:17,850
天佑吾王！
God save King George!

610
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:39,580
我想是来对地方了
I think we came to the right place.

611
01:11:46,290 --> 01:11:49,090
有没有赏金？　这次恐怕没有赏金
- Any bounty? - No scalp money this time, Rollins.

612
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:50,790
但你杀了红衫军
But you can keep

613
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:54,490
就可以卖给我他们的枪和装备
or sell me the muskets and gear of any Redcoat you kill.

614
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:08,190
他们在艾克华斯吊死我弟
They hanged my brother down in Acworth.

615
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:11,610
那些红衫军都该死
Every damned one of them Redcoats deserves to die.

616
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:13,640
那就加入我们　　我浑身残疾…
- Sign up. - With all my ailments...

617
01:12:13,650 --> 01:12:16,660
我撑不到前哨战，我看还是算了
...I wouldn't make it through the first skirmish. No, sir.

618
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:19,780
但是我的黑奴可以代我上阵
But you can have my Negro. He'll fight in my stead.

619
01:12:19,990 --> 01:12:21,450
欧坎！过来
Occam! Get over here.

620
01:12:22,950 --> 01:12:26,460
他不聪明，但很强壮
Ain't overly smart. He's strong as a bull.

621
01:12:26,670 --> 01:12:27,710
你会写字吗？
Can you write?

622
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:30,590
不会
No, no, sir.

623
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:32,850
那就画押吧　　为什么？
- Well, then, make your mark. - Why?

624
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:34,720
我把他让给你了
I just signed him over to you.

625
01:12:34,970 --> 01:12:37,490
你愿意的话，我想要你画押
If you're willing, make your mark.

626
01:12:43,930 --> 01:12:44,930
这样就行了
That'll do.

627
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:52,020
我要去杀红衫军
I'll kill me some Redcoats.

628
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:54,280
我相信你会
I believe you would.

629
01:12:54,650 --> 01:12:55,820
你几岁？
How old are you?

630
01:12:56,070 --> 01:12:58,610
还不够大，但时候会到的
Not quite old enough. But his time will come.

631
01:12:58,860 --> 01:13:01,330
约翰・比林斯，我希望你会来
John Billings. I was hoping you'd turn up.

632
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:04,040
传说有20名红衫军…
There's a story going around about 20 Redcoats...

633
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:06,960
被鬼杀了
...got killed by a ghost or some damn thing.

634
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:08,790
这鬼带一个印第安斧头
Carried a Cherokee tomahawk.

635
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:13,920
你相信鬼故事，不嫌老吗？
Aren't you a little old to be believing in ghost stories?

636
01:14:20,150 --> 01:14:21,780
你找到几个？
How many did you get?

637
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:23,280
12个
Twelve.

638
01:14:24,070 --> 01:14:25,080
很好
Good.

639
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:29,000
我们要的不是这种人
These men, they're not the sort we need.

640
01:14:32,290 --> 01:14:34,420
我们要的正是这种人
They're exactly the sort we need.

641
01:14:35,630 --> 01:14:37,760
他们以前打过这种仗
They've fought this kind of war before.

642
01:14:41,470 --> 01:14:43,260
那我呢？我也是之一吗？
What about me? Am I one of that sort?

643
01:14:43,970 --> 01:14:45,220
当然不
Hell, no.

644
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:47,810
你这种人把耻辱带给那种人
Your sort gives that sort a bad name.

645
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:56,820
我要求快狠准
I want accuracy and precision.

646
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:58,480
准备！
Make ready!

647
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:04,780
瞄准！
Take aim!

648
01:15:09,950 --> 01:15:11,290
开火！
Fire!

649
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:50,790
悬赏：抓鬼

650
01:15:50,790 --> 01:15:51,080
悬赏：抓鬼，亲爱的安：
Dear Anne:

651
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:52,040
亲爱的安：
Dear Anne:

652
01:15:52,330 --> 01:15:54,370
我们的军力越来越强
Our force continues to grow.

653
01:15:54,580 --> 01:15:59,240
只要我们奋战不懈，其它人就会起而效尤
As long as we continue to fight, others will come to fight beside us.

654
01:15:59,250 --> 01:16:02,260
我很想见你和跟你说话
I long to see you and speak to you.

655
01:16:02,510 --> 01:16:05,250
也希望我能因职务之便靠近你
I'm hopeful that our duties will bring me near you.

656
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:09,600
在见面之前，我会时时想着你
Until then, I am and will remain most affectionately yours.

657
01:16:09,810 --> 01:16:10,810
佳百列上
Gabriel.

658
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:38,790
我们投降！
We surrender!

659
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,380
不！天啊，不要！
No! God, stop!

660
01:16:42,590 --> 01:16:44,050
看在老天的份上…
For the love of God, we...

661
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:46,880
这些人就要投降了！
These men were about to surrender!

662
01:16:48,930 --> 01:16:50,260
也许吧
Perhaps.

663
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:51,510
我们永远也无从得知
We will never know.

664
01:16:52,010 --> 01:16:53,020
这是谋杀！
This is murder!

665
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:57,730
牧师，他们是红衫军，他们罪该万死
Hell, reverend, they're Redcoats. They've earned it.

666
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:02,140
我们比他们好多了　　你对战争懂什么？
- We're better than that. - What do you know about war?

667
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:04,030
我知道为崇高目标而战…
I know the difference between fighting...

668
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:05,950
回你的教堂！
Go back to church!

669
01:17:06,110 --> 01:17:07,400
安静！
Quiet!

670
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:10,570
他说得对
He's right.

671
01:17:11,330 --> 01:17:14,910
我们要收容那些受伤及投降的英军
Quarter will be given to British wounded and any who surrender.

672
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:17,120
当他们对我的妻儿坐的船开火时
They gave no quarter when they fired on a ship

673
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:19,370
也没想到要手下留情
 carrying my wife and daughters.

674
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:23,750
我在200码外眼睁睁看着他们被烧死
I watched from 200 yards off as they were burned alive.

675
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:27,540
我很同情你，但就这样…　去你的同情
- All my sympathy, but my order stands. - Damn your sympathy.

676
01:17:27,630 --> 01:17:29,840
你凭什么下这种命令？
Who are you to give such an order?

677
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:32,810
我知道你和你手下在维尔德尼斯堡…
I know what you did to

678
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:34,810
是怎么对我的同胞
my countrymen at Fort Wilderness.

679
01:17:36,350 --> 01:17:39,770
我们是民兵，不是正规军
We're militia. This is not regular army.

680
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:43,320
这里的人可以自行决定去留
Every man here is free to come and go as he pleases.

681
01:17:43,570 --> 01:17:44,690
但你们留下来的话…
But while you're here...

682
01:17:45,070 --> 01:17:47,530
就要听我的命令，否则军法处置
...you will obey my command or I will have you shot.

683
01:17:53,450 --> 01:17:55,690
该死的狗辈！　杀了它们！
- Damn dogs! - Shoot the damn things!

684
01:17:55,740 --> 01:17:59,430
别开枪　　它们不让任何人靠近车
- Stay that pistol. - They won't let you near the wagon.

685
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:07,260
是兰姆酒　　难怪它们看的这么紧
- Rum, Madeira. - No wonder they were guarding it.

686
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:08,670
军官的制服
Officers' uniforms.

687
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:10,760
你们猜这值多少钱？
What you think all this is worth?

688
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:15,600
这是康瓦理斯将军的私人物品
It's the personal correspondence of Lord Cornwallis.

689
01:18:17,930 --> 01:18:18,930
这是他的日记
This is his journal.

690
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:22,440
我们喝了他的酒，吃了他的狗
I say we drink the wine, eat the dogs

691
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:24,720
用这些纸来塞毛瑟枪
and use the papers for musket wadding.

692
01:18:24,770 --> 01:18:26,110
吃他的狗？
Eat the dogs?

693
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:29,070
狗肉很好吃
Dog is a fine meal.

694
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:31,610
我的天啊
Good heavens.

695
01:18:44,790 --> 01:18:46,750
我这里有地图
I have some maps here for you.

696
01:18:48,130 --> 01:18:50,670
放在那里，谢谢
Put them down over there. Thank you.

697
01:18:51,930 --> 01:18:54,220
给你一把毛瑟枪
Here. A proper musket for you.

698
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:56,470
我不知道你们怎么样
I don't know about you,

699
01:18:56,470 --> 01:18:59,440
但我觉得不该让黑奴拿枪
 but I don't like the idea giving muskets to slaves.

700
01:19:01,310 --> 01:19:03,600
你对自由一点概念都没有
Your sense of freedom is as pale as your skin.

701
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:12,110
别听他们的
Don't listen to them.

702
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:16,830
打赢这场仗很多事都会变
If we win this war, a lot of things will change.

703
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:19,250
什么会变？
What will change?

704
01:19:20,620 --> 01:19:22,620
他们说这里是新大陆，不是
They call this the New World. It's not.

705
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:25,290
这里和旧大陆一样
It's the same as the old.

706
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:30,460
但我们有机会建立新世界
But we'll have a chance to build a new world.

707
01:19:33,590 --> 01:19:38,060
新世界中人人平等
A world where all men are created equal under God.

708
01:19:38,850 --> 01:19:40,100
平等
Equal.

709
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:43,140
听起来很不错
Sounds good.

710
01:19:44,310 --> 01:19:46,690
我刚刚看了天才的杰作
I've just been in the mind of a genius.

711
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:53,990
康瓦理斯对战争的知识丰富得令人咋舌
Cornwallis knows more about warfare than we could learn in a dozen lifetimes.

712
01:19:54,570 --> 01:19:55,910
那倒是令人振奋的好消息
That's cheerful news.

713
01:19:56,370 --> 01:20:00,660
他在坎登和查理士城的胜利无懈可击
His victories at Camden and Charles Town were perfect. Perfect.

714
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:03,580
而且他心里明白
And he knows it, what's more.

715
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:07,330
也许这就是他的弱点
Perhaps that's his weakness.

716
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:09,000
长官？
Sir?

717
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:11,460
骄傲
Pride.

718
01:20:12,670 --> 01:20:14,090
骄傲是弱点
Pride's a weakness.

719
01:20:14,630 --> 01:20:17,180
我还是希望他蠢一些
Personally, I would prefer stupidity.

720
01:20:19,470 --> 01:20:20,810
骄傲就行了
Pride will do.

721
01:20:32,030 --> 01:20:33,820
做好了
Finished, my lord.

722
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:36,280
我把背后改紧…
I've taken it in at the back...

723
01:20:36,530 --> 01:20:39,240
加了肩章和金边
...added wider epaulets and looped gold braiding.

724
01:20:39,450 --> 01:20:42,740
这简直是马用的毛毯　　这我就不知道了
- It's a horse blanket. - I don't know, my lord.

725
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:45,080
看起来很不错
It's really quite nice.

726
01:20:45,410 --> 01:20:48,210
非常不错　　这是一条很好的马毛毯
- Very nice, my lord. - Very well. It's a nice horse blanket.

727
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:52,880
塔维顿上校，为什么都等了六个星期…
Colonel Tavington, why, after six weeks...

728
01:20:53,090 --> 01:20:56,180
我还在南卡参加舞会
...am I still attending a ball in South Carolina...

729
01:20:56,430 --> 01:20:59,140
而我现在应该早就在北卡了
...when I should be attending balls in North Carolina?

730
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:00,720
先是我的行李被偷…
First, the theft of my baggage...

731
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:03,850
包括我费尽心力写的日志
...including my memoirs, on which I spent countless hours.

732
01:21:04,430 --> 01:21:06,240
接着从这儿到查理士城
Then half the bridges

733
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:08,440
半数以上的渡口及桥梁都被烧了
and ferries between here and Charles Town burned.

734
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:11,150
如果你无法对抗民兵，保护补给线…
If you can't protect our supply lines against militia...

735
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:14,940
你要怎么对抗正规军和法军呢？
...how do you intend doing so against the Regulars or the French?

736
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:17,780
他们不打正规战，我们找不到他们
They won't fight like Regulars. We can't find them.

737
01:21:17,990 --> 01:21:20,450
他们是民兵
Colonel, they're militia.

738
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:23,410
他们是拿着耙子的农夫！
They're farmers with pitchforks!

739
01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:26,710
他们不止是农夫
They're rather more than that, I'm afraid.

740
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,920
他们是鬼影指挥官调教的
Made so by their commander, this ghost.

741
01:21:30,170 --> 01:21:33,000
鬼，鬼，鬼
Oh, ghost, ghost, ghost.

742
01:21:33,590 --> 01:21:36,170
那个鬼是你塑造出来的
You created this ghost, colonel.

743
01:21:37,010 --> 01:21:38,800
他的阶级是你帮他挂的
Your brutality swelled his ranks.

744
01:21:39,050 --> 01:21:41,350
要是没有他们就没有这个鬼…
Without them this ghost would've disappeared...

745
01:21:41,390 --> 01:21:43,930
而我现在已到北卡了！
...and I'd be in North Carolina by now!

746
01:21:44,180 --> 01:21:45,430
我要为我辩护…
In my defence, my lord...

747
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:47,520
够了…！
Oh, enough, enough!

748
01:21:48,230 --> 01:21:52,480
亏你是个好军人居然会怕鬼
A fine soldier you are, bested by a bedtime story.

749
01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:55,780
把那个马毛毯给我
Give me the horse blanket.

750
01:21:58,990 --> 01:22:02,070
奥哈拉，我们的补给船似乎来了
O'Hara, our supply ship appears to have arrived.

751
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:04,120
是的
Yes, my lord, it has.

752
01:22:04,330 --> 01:22:06,790
那我为什么要穿这个地毯？
Then why am I still wearing this rag?

753
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,920
长官，您的礼服在船上，但是…
Your replacement wardrobe is aboard ship, but...

754
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:14,210
塔维顿上校认为要先搬军用品
...Colonel Tavington thought it best to secure our arms and munitions first.

755
01:22:14,380 --> 01:22:15,550
弟兄们现在正在搬
They are being unloaded.

756
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:28,730
你穿这个颜色很好看
You look good in that colour.

757
01:22:30,850 --> 01:22:32,100
臭死了
It stinks.

758
01:22:34,110 --> 01:22:35,900
原来是死人穿的
Well, it's had a dead man in it.

759
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:38,070
那些野蛮人连你的狗都不放过？
The beasts took your dogs too?

760
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:39,700
是的
Yes.

761
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:43,870
那两只好狗是国王送我的
Fine animals. A gift from His Majesty.

762
01:22:44,780 --> 01:22:46,330
据我所知，大概已经死了
Dead now, for all I know.

763
01:22:46,790 --> 01:22:49,000
没有天理了吗？
Is there no decency?

764
01:22:58,260 --> 01:23:02,010
太棒了！是烟火
Oh, fireworks. Lovely!

765
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,540
霍华先生
Mr. Howard.

766
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:38,630
我是来看安的
I've come to call on Anne.

767
01:23:44,430 --> 01:23:47,510
我是来看安的！
I've come to call on Anne!

768
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:49,970
你当然是个男人
Well, of course you call yourself a man.

769
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:54,310
父亲，别逗了，你听到他说的
Father, stop it. You heard him.

770
01:23:56,860 --> 01:23:57,860
这个嘛…
Well...

771
01:23:58,570 --> 01:24:00,070
去看她吧
...call on her.

772
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:27,180
我快好了
I'm nearly finished.

773
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:30,720
别担心，父亲
You needn't worry, Father.

774
01:24:30,970 --> 01:24:32,390
我知道
Yeah, I know.

775
01:24:32,980 --> 01:24:35,310
我觉得这布丁袋是很好的传统
Bundling bags are a wonderful tradition.

776
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:37,410
我一点都不介意
I don't mind in the least.

777
01:24:38,610 --> 01:24:40,150
不要动
Be still.

778
01:24:40,730 --> 01:24:41,780
要茶吗？
Tea?

779
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:44,150
麻烦你
Please.

780
01:24:45,950 --> 01:24:46,990
好了
There.

781
01:24:55,540 --> 01:24:56,790
来吧，亲爱的
Come, dear.

782
01:25:08,340 --> 01:25:09,800
很好
It's very good.

783
01:25:12,810 --> 01:25:15,020
你喜欢我就放心了
I'm pleased that you like it.

784
01:25:23,860 --> 01:25:25,030
彼德
Peter.

785
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:29,370
别担心，我的针上工夫比我妈好
Don't worry. I sew better than my mother did.

786
01:25:32,450 --> 01:25:33,910
希望如此
I hope so.

787
01:25:40,170 --> 01:25:42,210
如果你只是站在那里…
If you're just gonna stand there...

788
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:44,210
为什么不念出来给我们听？
...why don't you read it for us?

789
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:46,050
我不识字
I can't read.

790
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:50,090
我会
I can.

791
01:25:53,350 --> 01:25:54,350
请注意
"Take notice.

792
01:25:55,270 --> 01:25:58,770
华盛顿将军及大陆会议下令…
By order of General Washington and the Continental Congress...

793
01:25:58,940 --> 01:26:02,060
在独立军中…
...all bound slaves who give minimum one year service...

794
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:03,980
服役一年以上的奴隶…
...in the Continental Army...

795
01:26:04,820 --> 01:26:06,860
将可重获自由…
...will be granted freedom...

796
01:26:07,530 --> 01:26:11,280
并可得到每个月五先令的薪水
...and be paid a bounty of five shillings for each month of service."

797
01:26:11,780 --> 01:26:13,160
你听到了吗？
Did you hear that?

798
01:26:13,370 --> 01:26:16,620
先是要放他们自由，接下来又要付他们钱
First they'll free them, then they'll pay them.

799
01:26:16,950 --> 01:26:19,170
只要再六个月
Only another six months.

800
01:26:21,830 --> 01:26:23,630
你自由后要做什么？
What will you do with freedom?

801
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:36,680
这是我帮你做的
I made this for you.

802
01:26:53,070 --> 01:26:54,870
好好照顾你妈
Look after your mother.

803
01:27:00,370 --> 01:27:01,870
你知道吗，彼德…
You know, Peter...

804
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:04,170
我没有办法付你钱
...I can't pay you for this.

805
01:27:04,380 --> 01:27:08,550
你方便时再给
Benjamin, you pay me what you can, when you can.

806
01:27:09,010 --> 01:27:10,420
感激不尽
I'm obliged.

807
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:15,050
佳百列真的很像你
Gabriel sure reminds me a lot of you.

808
01:27:16,310 --> 01:27:18,520
不，他比较像他妈
No, no, he's more like his mother.

809
01:27:20,270 --> 01:27:21,520
下士！
Corporal!

810
01:27:23,060 --> 01:27:24,940
你慢慢来，狗儿们
Take your time. Dogs.

811
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:43,210
先生
Sir.

812
01:28:29,630 --> 01:28:31,510
道路封闭了
This road is closed.

813
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:34,670
这些车辆现在正式成为独立军的财产
These wagons now belong to the Continental Army.

814
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:37,140
准备！
Ready arms!

815
01:28:49,940 --> 01:28:51,360
排成两列
By twos!

816
01:29:00,370 --> 01:29:04,400
你和你的手下不必死，留下车子就走吧
There's no need for your men to die. Leave the wagons and go.

817
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:06,250
这是国王的公路
This is the king's highway.

818
01:29:06,620 --> 01:29:09,380
我劝你和你的手下让开
And I advise you and your men to make way.

819
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:17,380
进攻！
Charge!

820
01:29:18,430 --> 01:29:19,510
开火！
Fire!

821
01:29:20,850 --> 01:29:22,220
撤退！
Retreat!

822
01:29:29,230 --> 01:29:30,610
保留实力！
Save yourselves!

823
01:29:58,760 --> 01:29:59,800
撤退！
Retreat!

824
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:20,660
有埋伏…！
Ambush! Ambush!

825
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:55,980
我统计了一下
I have the count.

826
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:59,240
死了二十二个人
22 are dead.

827
01:30:59,990 --> 01:31:02,360
十八个人受伤，二十人失踪
18 wounded and 20 are missing.

828
01:31:02,660 --> 01:31:03,990
我不干了
I'm through.

829
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,620
他不是最后一个要走的人
He won't be the last to leave.

830
01:31:12,330 --> 01:31:14,540
相信我，我的同胞很快就会到
Trust me. Soon my countrymen will arrive.

831
01:31:14,790 --> 01:31:16,750
法国军队…　你下地狱
- The French army is... - To hell with you.

832
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:18,550
法国军队下地狱
And to hell with the French army.

833
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:19,840
我们不需要他们
We don't need them.

834
01:31:20,090 --> 01:31:21,420
我们有班杰明・马汀
We got Benjamin Martin.

835
01:31:21,420 --> 01:31:24,220
我们知道他是怎么对付法国人的
We know what he done to the French.

836
01:31:37,820 --> 01:31:39,190
父亲
Father.

837
01:31:39,740 --> 01:31:45,070
你在维尔德尼斯堡的英勇事迹，人人佩服
Men always buy you drinks because of what happened at Fort Wilderness.

838
01:31:46,580 --> 01:31:49,200
陌生人都比我了解你
Strangers know more about you than I do.

839
01:31:51,290 --> 01:31:52,920
告诉我当时的情况
Tell me what happened.

840
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:58,670
你出生时，你母亲也问过我这个问题
Your mother asked me that question around about the time you were born.

841
01:32:01,510 --> 01:32:04,220
我当时烂醉如泥才会回答
I was drunk and foolish enough to answer it.

842
01:32:10,850 --> 01:32:14,310
法国人和印地安人突击蓝桥
The French and the Cherokee had raided along the Blue Ridge.

843
01:32:15,060 --> 01:32:18,150
英国殖民到查尔斯堡寻求庇护
The English settlers had sought refuge at Fort Charles.

844
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:21,610
我们抵达时那里已经没人了
By the time we got there, the fort was abandoned.

845
01:32:23,110 --> 01:32:25,240
他们一周前就离开了
They'd left about a week before.

846
01:32:26,700 --> 01:32:29,240
但是我们发现…
But what we found was...

847
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:33,290
继续说
Go on.

848
01:32:36,420 --> 01:32:39,920
他们杀光所有的男的殖民
They'd killed all the settlers, the men.

849
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:43,760
女人和…
With the women and...

850
01:32:43,970 --> 01:32:46,180
某些孩童被他们…
...some of the children, they had...

851
01:32:49,260 --> 01:32:52,220
我们把他们的遗骸全埋了
We buried them all, what was left of them.

852
01:32:54,890 --> 01:32:57,610
我们在维尔德尼斯堡追上他们
We caught up with them at Fort Wilderness.

853
01:33:00,690 --> 01:33:02,280
我们好整以暇
We took our time.

854
01:33:04,610 --> 01:33:07,490
把他们五马分尸
We cut them apart slowly.

855
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:09,990
千刀万剐
Piece by piece.

856
01:33:15,330 --> 01:33:17,290
他们的脸庞历历在目
I can see their faces.

857
01:33:20,590 --> 01:33:22,800
耳边仿佛回荡着他们的尖叫
I can still hear their screams.

858
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:28,260
我们只留了两个活口
All but two. We let them live.

859
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:31,760
我们让那两个人
We sent the heads on a pallet...

860
01:33:31,970 --> 01:33:34,600
带着那些人的项上人头回去
...with the two that lived back to Fort Ambercon.

861
01:33:35,350 --> 01:33:38,600
眼睛，舌头，手指…
The eyes, tongues, fingers...

862
01:33:38,770 --> 01:33:40,770
我们则装在篮子里
...we put in baskets.

863
01:33:41,190 --> 01:33:43,980
送到印地安人那儿去
Sent them down the Asheulot to the Cherokee.

864
01:33:46,070 --> 01:33:50,620
不久后，印地安人便不再与法国人合作
Soon after, the Cherokee broke their treaty with the French.

865
01:33:52,330 --> 01:33:54,410
我们就是这样平衡的
That's how we justified it.

866
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:04,840
我们是…
We were...

867
01:34:06,510 --> 01:34:07,880
英雄
...heroes.

868
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:12,430
那些人请你喝酒
And men bought you drinks.

869
01:34:17,180 --> 01:34:21,190
我每天都在祈求上帝宽恕我
Not a day goes by where I don't ask God's forgiveness for what I did.

870
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:33,370
托马斯是我的弟弟，也是你的儿子
Thomas was my brother, as well as your son.

871
01:34:33,700 --> 01:34:38,620
你也许不信，但我和你一样想要报仇
You may not believe this, but I want satisfaction as much as you do.

872
01:34:39,670 --> 01:34:41,710
但在不影响原则下
But not at the expense of our cause.

873
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:45,500
仇终究是要报的
There will be a time for revenge.

874
01:34:46,510 --> 01:34:48,970
但在那之前我会为自由奋斗
But until then, stay the course.

875
01:34:51,090 --> 01:34:54,490
我喝醉或发脾气时，你妈会说这句话
Your mother said that when I'd get drunk or lose my temper.

876
01:34:54,510 --> 01:34:56,970
我挑托马斯毛病时她会这么说
She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas.

877
01:35:03,020 --> 01:35:04,270
我好想他
I miss him.

878
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:24,400
我们有十八名弟兄在卡罗莱纳州堡被俘
The British got 18 of our men at Fort Carolina.

879
01:35:24,460 --> 01:35:28,460
除非他们说出我们下落，否则都会被吊死
They'll be hung one at a time until they give up the rest of us.

880
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:44,690
牧师…
Reverend...

881
01:35:44,940 --> 01:35:46,900
能帮我写封信吗？
...can you write a letter for me?

882
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:49,990
写给我太太和儿子　　没问题
- To my wife and boy. - Yes, of course I will.

883
01:35:50,150 --> 01:35:53,160
不过，我们先来祷告
But first let us pray.

884
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:08,920
大人…
My lord...

885
01:36:09,300 --> 01:36:11,010
大门外有一名骑士
...there is a rider at the gates.

886
01:36:11,380 --> 01:36:14,130
一名举白旗的平民
A civilian carrying a white flag.

887
01:36:14,510 --> 01:36:16,100
我很忙
I am occupied.

888
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:18,970
他带了两只狗
He has a pair of dogs with him.

889
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:22,020
是大丹狗
Great Danes.

890
01:36:22,980 --> 01:36:23,980
主啊…
And dear Lord...

891
01:36:24,190 --> 01:36:26,480
请在这个危急的时刻，保佑我们
...protect us in this, our hour of need.

892
01:36:26,650 --> 01:36:30,400
我们以圣父，圣子…
This we ask in the name of the Father, the Son...

893
01:36:30,610 --> 01:36:32,320
和圣灵之名求您
And the Holy Ghost.

894
01:36:37,490 --> 01:36:38,660
在这里等
Wait here.

895
01:36:38,990 --> 01:36:41,250
康瓦理斯将军马上来
General Lord Cornwallis will be with you shortly.

896
01:37:24,830 --> 01:37:27,710
木星，土星，来
Jupiter, Mars. Come, boys.

897
01:37:30,630 --> 01:37:31,630
来
Come.

898
01:37:35,130 --> 01:37:39,050
我的乖狗狗，你们似乎没有吃苦
My good boys. My brave boys. You seem to be well fed.

899
01:37:40,930 --> 01:37:42,520
谢谢你
I thank you for that.

900
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:45,270
我还不知道你的名字
I'm afraid I don't know your name.

901
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:50,430
我是独立军上校，你只要知道这个就够了
I'm a colonel in the Continental Army. My rank should be sufficient for now.

902
01:37:50,610 --> 01:37:52,070
随你便
As you wish.

903
01:37:52,900 --> 01:37:54,070
请坐
Please be seated.

904
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:55,280
谢谢
Thank you.

905
01:37:57,240 --> 01:38:00,910
请你开始说明来意吧？
Would you, as the initiating officer, care to begin?

906
01:38:01,530 --> 01:38:04,450
我会的，除非你要先申报你的损失
I will, unless you'd like to claim aggrieved status.

907
01:38:04,660 --> 01:38:07,330
是的，我要先这么做
Yes, I would like to claim aggrieved status.

908
01:38:07,540 --> 01:38:09,250
那么，请继续吧
Very well, sir. Proceed.

909
01:38:09,580 --> 01:38:13,960
你手上有我的私人物品，包括衣服…
You have in your possession belongings of mine including clothing...

910
01:38:14,260 --> 01:38:17,760
家具及私人日志…
...furniture, personal effects of a non-military nature...

911
01:38:18,470 --> 01:38:20,180
我希望你能还我
...which I'd like returned to me.

912
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:23,390
我会尽快办到的
Indeed. I will do so as soon as possible.

913
01:38:24,970 --> 01:38:26,060
谢谢
Thank you.

914
01:38:26,390 --> 01:38:29,560
现在我们来谈谈，你们在战场上…
Now we come to the matter of the specific targeting...

915
01:38:29,690 --> 01:38:31,690
针对我们军官开枪的事
...of officers during engagements.

916
01:38:32,150 --> 01:38:35,490
你应该知道在文明战争中，战场上军官…
You must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field...

917
01:38:35,530 --> 01:38:39,910
不该表现出不合时宜的敌意
...must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention.

918
01:38:40,910 --> 01:38:44,690
你认为怎样才叫做不合时宜的敌意？
To your mind, what are appropriate levels of hostile attention?

919
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:47,000
想想看，要是群龙无首…
Imagine the chaos that would follow...

920
01:38:47,250 --> 01:38:50,420
两军相争时，会如何混乱
...from leaderless armies having at each other.

921
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:54,040
一定要有指挥官…
There must be gentlemen in command to lead...

922
01:38:54,300 --> 01:38:57,630
才能够在必要时控制军队
...and, where necessary, restrain their men.

923
01:38:58,630 --> 01:39:02,760
例如，不让他们欺凌老弱妇孺
Restrain them from, say, targeting civilians. Women, children and such.

924
01:39:06,100 --> 01:39:07,220
那又是另一回事了
That's a separate issue.

925
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:09,310
不，我认为是同一件事
No. I consider them linked.

926
01:39:10,140 --> 01:39:12,860
只要你的手下攻击平民百姓…
And as long as your soldiers attack civilians...

927
01:39:13,060 --> 01:39:17,150
我就会命令我手下，开战时屠杀你的军官
...I will order the shooting of officers at every engagement.

928
01:39:18,690 --> 01:39:21,160
我的手下都是神枪手
And my men are excellent marksmen.

929
01:39:25,410 --> 01:39:26,410
那好
Very well.

930
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:30,000
让我们继续讨论…　战俘交换事宜
- Now, let us move on to... - Prisoner exchange.

931
01:39:31,170 --> 01:39:32,170
先生？
Sir?

932
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:36,340
我这边确有18名犯人，我要你放了他们
You have 18 of my men. I want them back.

933
01:39:43,180 --> 01:39:47,810
我这边的确有18名死囚
I do have 18 criminals under sentence of death...

934
01:39:48,100 --> 01:39:51,000
但我绝对不会扣留战犯
...but I hold no prisoners of war.

935
01:39:51,020 --> 01:39:54,350
如果你拒绝，你就要为你18名军官的死负责
If that's your position, 18 of your officers will have to die.

936
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:56,430
19名，如果你把我一起吊死
Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.

937
01:39:56,650 --> 01:39:57,650
我的军官？
My officers?

938
01:39:57,900 --> 01:39:58,900
先生
Sir.

939
01:40:06,490 --> 01:40:09,450
在你左方的山顶的树下
Top of the ridge, to your left. Below the tree line.

940
01:40:22,590 --> 01:40:23,760
他们的名字和官阶？
Their names and ranks?

941
01:40:24,090 --> 01:40:26,090
他们不透露姓名，有九名少尉
They refused to give names. There are 9 lieutenants,

942
01:40:26,090 --> 01:40:28,210
五名上尉，三名少校…
5 captains, 3 majors...

943
01:40:28,260 --> 01:40:30,060
和一个说我厚颜无耻的…
...and one fat colonel who called me...

944
01:40:32,020 --> 01:40:33,730
肥上尉
...a cheeky fellow.

945
01:40:34,190 --> 01:40:36,900
这不是绅士该有的作为
This is not the conduct of a gentleman.

946
01:40:37,190 --> 01:40:40,030
如果你军官的作为…叫绅士作风
If the conduct of your officers is the measure of a gentleman...

947
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:42,490
那我觉得，你这是天大的恭维
...I'll take that as a compliment.

948
01:40:44,530 --> 01:40:45,700
去带我的手下来
Get my men.

949
01:40:49,660 --> 01:40:52,410
安排交换事宜　　大人
- Arrange the exchange. - My lord.

950
01:40:52,540 --> 01:40:53,830
谢谢你
Thank you, sir.

951
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:26,950
释放囚犯！
Release the prisoners!

952
01:41:31,910 --> 01:41:34,040
将军，这是做什么？　交换战俘
- What is this? - Prisoner exchange.

953
01:41:34,250 --> 01:41:35,830
他俘掳了我们十八名军官
He has 18 of our officers.

954
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:37,920
他是谁？我看过他
Who is he? I recognize him.

955
01:41:38,420 --> 01:41:40,040
他是民兵的指挥官
He's the commander of the militia.

956
01:41:41,550 --> 01:41:44,380
就是你说的鬼　　不要动，上校！
- Your ghost. - Stay that sword, colonel!

957
01:41:44,670 --> 01:41:47,310
他举着白旗前来谈判，没有敌意　是吗？
He rode in under a white flag for formal parley.

958
01:41:47,340 --> 01:41:48,590
这太疯狂了
This is madness.

959
01:41:49,300 --> 01:41:52,930
如果你伤害他，会害死我们的军官
If you harm him, you condemn our officers.

960
01:41:53,020 --> 01:41:57,190
请恕我说一句，他过去杀了不少军官
With respect, sir, he's killed as many officers in the last two months.

961
01:41:57,520 --> 01:42:01,980
他没有敌意，所以我们不能伤害他
He has shown no aggression here. Hence he cannot be touched.

962
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:03,860
他没有吗？
Has he not?

963
01:42:07,450 --> 01:42:08,450
你！
You!

964
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:12,160
原来你就是那个鬼，我记得你
So you're the ghost, are you? I remember you!

965
01:42:12,370 --> 01:42:14,410
在农场上！那个笨小孩
On that farm! That stupid little boy!

966
01:42:21,460 --> 01:42:22,840
他死了吗？
Did he die?

967
01:42:26,970 --> 01:42:28,050
你知道吗…
You know...

968
01:42:28,470 --> 01:42:31,140
有时克尽职责实在很不好受
...it's an ugly business, doing one's duty.

969
01:42:31,350 --> 01:42:33,470
但有时候…
But just occasionally...

970
01:42:34,140 --> 01:42:35,770
是赏心乐事
...it's a real pleasure.

971
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:42,730
在这场战争结束之前，我会杀了你
Before this war is over, I'm going to kill you.

972
01:42:46,190 --> 01:42:47,860
为什么要等？
Why wait?

973
01:42:57,200 --> 01:42:58,370
很快的
Soon.

974
01:43:31,410 --> 01:43:32,570
出发！
Move out!

975
01:43:37,290 --> 01:43:40,750
我还是觉得，北进太鲁莽
But I still think it's imperative to push north.

976
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:46,210
这是我们被俘的军官之一
One of our captured officers, my lord.

977
01:43:51,130 --> 01:43:54,390
你们的无能，害我脸上无光！
My reputation suffers because of your incompetence!

978
01:43:54,640 --> 01:43:57,560
那家伙羞辱我！
That man insults me!

979
01:43:58,430 --> 01:44:02,100
这乡巴佬还真不简单
Quite impressive for a farmer with a pitchfork, wouldn't you say?

980
01:44:09,320 --> 01:44:12,030
我要你去找他
I want you to find that man.

981
01:44:12,740 --> 01:44:14,780
我要你把他捉来
I want you to capture him.

982
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:18,410
人民对他很忠心
The man has the loyalty of the people.

983
01:44:18,910 --> 01:44:21,290
他们保护他和他的家人
They protect him. Protect his family.

984
01:44:21,500 --> 01:44:23,120
保护他手下的家人
Protect the families of his men.

985
01:44:24,540 --> 01:44:26,500
我可以帮你捉到他
I can capture him for you.

986
01:44:28,090 --> 01:44:32,120
但这就要用到一些不太光明的手段…
But to do so requires the use of tactics that are somewhat...

987
01:44:33,220 --> 01:44:35,430
大人之前是怎么说的？
What was the word your lordship used?

988
01:44:37,300 --> 01:44:38,810
好像说“残忍”
"Brutal," I think.

989
01:44:47,650 --> 01:44:48,650
继续
Go on.

990
01:44:57,830 --> 01:45:00,670
我准备好去做该做的事
I am prepared to do what is necessary.

991
01:45:00,700 --> 01:45:05,170
我愿意为我的行为负全责…
I alone will assume the full mantle of responsibility for my actions...

992
01:45:05,370 --> 01:45:07,500
我不受上级指挥…
...free of the chain of command...

993
01:45:07,710 --> 01:45:09,920
不管我做什么，你都不能怪我
...rendering you blameless.

994
01:45:10,590 --> 01:45:11,960
如果…
However...

995
01:45:12,170 --> 01:45:13,970
我这么做…
...if I do this...

996
01:45:14,180 --> 01:45:18,400
我们两个都知道，我永远无法载誉归国
...you and I both know that I can never return to England with honour.

997
01:45:21,390 --> 01:45:25,140
我将会有何下场？
What, I wonder, is to become of me?

998
01:45:32,740 --> 01:45:35,700
当这里的战争结束之后…
When this war is over here in the Colonies...

999
01:45:36,160 --> 01:45:37,950
新兴贵族…
...the new aristocracy...

1000
01:45:40,030 --> 01:45:41,830
将会是地主
...will be landowners.

1001
01:45:49,170 --> 01:45:51,800
告诉我俄亥俄州的事
Tell me about Ohio.

1002
01:45:57,430 --> 01:45:58,590
让开
Make way.

1003
01:45:59,720 --> 01:46:00,970
稍息
As you were.

1004
01:46:04,100 --> 01:46:08,190
威尔金，离维克菲尔七英哩处…
Wilkins. A plantation seven miles from Wakefield, on the Santee...

1005
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:12,560
山提河东岸的黑沼泽，是什么人住的？
...east of Black Swamp. Who lived there?

1006
01:46:12,650 --> 01:46:14,150
班杰明・马汀
Benjamin Martin.

1007
01:46:14,360 --> 01:46:16,070
他就是我们说的鬼
He's the ghost.

1008
01:46:16,820 --> 01:46:18,240
你对他知道多少？
What do you know about him?

1009
01:46:18,450 --> 01:46:22,030
无所不知，我连他几号鞋都知道
Hell, everything. I could tell you the size of his boot.

1010
01:46:22,950 --> 01:46:26,790
他有家人吗？他把孩子藏在哪里？
Does he have family? Where would he hide his children?

1011
01:46:35,890 --> 01:46:38,560
他的小姨子有一个农庄
His wife's sister has a plantation.

1012
01:46:39,020 --> 01:46:40,640
不远
It's not far.

1013
01:47:14,430 --> 01:47:17,600
夏绿蒂阿姨，醒醒，有人来了！
Aunt Charlotte! Wake up, someone's coming!

1014
01:47:23,150 --> 01:47:24,770
去叫孩子们
Get the boys.

1015
01:47:27,230 --> 01:47:29,860
玛格莉特，快来
Margaret, come quickly.

1016
01:47:30,070 --> 01:47:32,860
我们走　　孩子们，来吧
- Let's go. - Boys, come.

1017
01:47:33,450 --> 01:47:34,280
快！
Go.

1018
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:40,830
跟着我
Stay close.

1019
01:47:46,630 --> 01:47:48,050
走这边，从窗台下出去
This way.

1020
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:05,770
跟着我
Follow me.

1021
01:48:09,190 --> 01:48:11,740
我们下楼到厨房
We'll go downstairs to the kitchen.

1022
01:48:17,870 --> 01:48:20,160
玛格莉特，快！从这下面！快！
Margaret, quick! Get down there! Fast!

1023
01:48:32,050 --> 01:48:34,090
山缪，快下来！
Samuel, get down there fast!

1024
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:33,400
在下面，那里
Beneath the sill. There.

1025
01:49:35,990 --> 01:49:37,530
房子里没有人
There's no one in the house.

1026
01:49:37,740 --> 01:49:39,200
他们一定没走远
They can't be far.

1027
01:49:39,620 --> 01:49:41,990
去树林里找找
Search the outbuildings and the woods, quickly.

1028
01:50:19,740 --> 01:50:21,620
准备放火烧房子
Prepare to fire the house.

1029
01:50:22,410 --> 01:50:23,780
快走
Go.

1030
01:50:43,510 --> 01:50:45,470
这是他们家里的奴隶
This one's head of the house slaves.

1031
01:50:50,690 --> 01:50:52,270
他们躲在哪里？
Where are they hiding?

1032
01:50:56,110 --> 01:50:58,490
继续找，他们一定在附近！
Keep looking! They're here somewhere!

1033
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:05,950
佳百列　　父亲呢？
- Gabriel. - Where's Father?

1034
01:51:06,290 --> 01:51:08,000
放火烧房子！
Torch the house!

1035
01:51:25,640 --> 01:51:26,640
上马！
To horse!

1036
01:51:34,020 --> 01:51:35,730
跟我来，不要紧的
Come on! It's all right.

1037
01:51:35,940 --> 01:51:37,820
苏珊，过来
Susan, come here.

1038
01:51:47,030 --> 01:51:48,200
夏绿蒂！
Charlotte!

1039
01:52:04,050 --> 01:52:06,930
他们不会放弃找我们的
They won't stop looking for us.

1040
01:52:09,220 --> 01:52:11,350
我们会带你们去安全的地方
You'll be safe where we're taking you.

1041
01:52:12,230 --> 01:52:14,770
父亲说在那里藏身最适合了
Father said it was a perfect place to hide.

1042
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:18,900
他还好吗？
How is he?

1043
01:52:24,150 --> 01:52:25,910
我不知道，我是他的儿子
I don't know. I'm his son.

1044
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:28,080
父亲呢？
Where is Father?

1045
01:52:29,620 --> 01:52:31,200
几个月前开始说话
Speaking for months now.

1046
01:52:31,410 --> 01:52:33,000
几个月前开始说话
Speaking for months.

1047
01:52:33,210 --> 01:52:35,000
他到哪里去了？
Why did he go?

1048
01:52:37,210 --> 01:52:39,210
他不要那些人找到你们
He didn't want those mean men to find you,

1049
01:52:39,210 --> 01:52:41,250
所以他引他们离开
so he led them away.

1050
01:52:41,300 --> 01:52:43,670
他会尽快回来看你们
He'll come see you as soon as he can.

1051
01:52:43,970 --> 01:52:46,590
我不管，我恨他
I don't care. I hate him.

1052
01:52:48,350 --> 01:52:50,060
苏珊，你不恨他
Susan, you don't hate him.

1053
01:52:50,220 --> 01:52:53,770
我恨他，我希望他永远不回来
I hate him, and I hope he never comes back.

1054
01:53:27,590 --> 01:53:29,470
是孩子们
It's the children.

1055
01:53:30,510 --> 01:53:31,510
艾比佳！
Abigale!

1056
01:53:33,430 --> 01:53:34,980
你还活着！
You're alive!

1057
01:53:45,110 --> 01:53:48,950
我知道不多，但你可以跟我一起
I know it's not much, but you can stay here with me.

1058
01:54:08,010 --> 01:54:10,470
很美
It's beautiful.

1059
01:54:11,010 --> 01:54:12,600
谢谢
Thank you.

1060
01:54:24,900 --> 01:54:28,740
她说话了，苏珊跟你说话了？
She spoke. Susan talked to you?

1061
01:54:28,950 --> 01:54:30,570
整句
In full sentences.

1062
01:54:30,820 --> 01:54:33,450
好像她一直都可以说话
As if she'd been speaking all along.

1063
01:54:35,830 --> 01:54:37,620
可恶，我居然不在场
Damn, I wasn't there for it.

1064
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:40,080
她说什么？
What did she say?

1065
01:54:42,670 --> 01:54:44,460
她说…
She said...

1066
01:54:45,960 --> 01:54:49,090
她很爱你也很想你…
...that she loves you and misses you...

1067
01:54:49,510 --> 01:54:53,800
她也了解你为什么不能来陪她
...but understands why you can't be with her.

1068
01:54:55,180 --> 01:54:56,970
天啊，真的吗？
My Lord, she said that.

1069
01:54:57,680 --> 01:54:58,480
真不可思议
Isn't that something?

1070
01:55:02,940 --> 01:55:06,010
塔维顿有我们的名单，在烧我们的房子…
Tavington has a list of our men. He's burning our homes...

1071
01:55:06,020 --> 01:55:08,460
若有不从，格杀勿论
...killing whomever resists.

1072
01:55:08,530 --> 01:55:12,750
在哪里？　他烧了山提河岸的七栋房子
- Where? - Seven homes along the Santee so far.

1073
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,870
约翰
John.

1074
01:56:10,670 --> 01:56:13,010
现在不是报仇的时候
John, this is not a time for vengeance.

1075
01:56:13,880 --> 01:56:16,470
是哀悼的时候
This is a time for mourning.

1076
01:56:21,100 --> 01:56:22,850
约翰
John.

1077
01:56:31,610 --> 01:56:32,900
不！
No!

1078
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:52,670
去照顾你们的家人
Attend to your families.

1079
01:56:55,050 --> 01:56:57,340
所有的人都放一周假
One week furlough for all men.

1080
01:56:58,180 --> 01:57:00,170
如果收假时，不回来的人
Any man who does not return

1081
01:57:00,180 --> 01:57:02,470
不会当你是懦夫临阵脱逃
 will not be thought a coward or uncommitted.

1082
01:57:18,570 --> 01:57:19,910
父亲！
Father!

1083
01:57:21,330 --> 01:57:23,040
爸爸！
Papa!

1084
01:57:29,080 --> 01:57:31,250
天啊，他们长得好大，你给他们吃什么？
They're huge. What have you been feeding them?

1085
01:57:31,420 --> 01:57:34,550
他们有爸爸的优良血统
They're from good stock on their father's side.

1086
01:57:43,220 --> 01:57:44,520
苏珊？
Susan?

1087
01:58:24,680 --> 01:58:28,060
我看到了，在那里，快看，父亲！
I see it. There it is. Look. Look, Father.

1088
01:58:30,150 --> 01:58:32,110
我抓到了…！
I got it! I got it!

1089
01:58:32,480 --> 01:58:33,520
你抓到了
You got it.

1090
01:58:34,320 --> 01:58:35,690
我抓到了！
I got it!

1091
01:58:35,900 --> 01:58:36,990
小心　　我抓到了
- Careful. - I caught it.

1092
01:58:37,190 --> 01:58:39,820
鱼都在这里　　我们去抓
- All the fish are over here. - Let's get them.

1093
01:58:46,700 --> 01:58:48,580
父亲，什么事情改变了你？
Father, what changed you?

1094
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:52,880
你确定我变了吗？
Are you sure I have?

1095
01:58:53,090 --> 01:58:56,050
是的，你变了
Yes. You changed.

1096
01:59:03,510 --> 01:59:04,890
很简单
That's simple.

1097
01:59:05,600 --> 01:59:06,640
是你妈妈
It was your mother.

1098
01:59:12,060 --> 01:59:14,980
女人对男人会有很奇怪的影响力
A woman can have a strange effect on a man.

1099
01:59:16,280 --> 01:59:17,900
曾经…
There were times...

1100
01:59:18,570 --> 01:59:20,820
在你妈身边，我连呼吸都有困难
...I had trouble breathing around your mother.

1101
01:59:22,030 --> 01:59:23,700
我了解你的感受
I know the feeling.

1102
01:59:25,780 --> 01:59:27,410
你说过…
You once said...

1103
01:59:30,370 --> 01:59:32,920
等我成家之后自然会明白
...when I had a family of my own, I'd understand.

1104
01:59:36,880 --> 01:59:38,420
你说得对
You were right.

1105
01:59:41,010 --> 01:59:42,890
你想告诉我什么？
You're trying to tell me something.

1106
01:59:59,780 --> 02:00:01,150
要吃苹果吗？　谢谢
- Apple? - Thank you.

1107
02:00:08,160 --> 02:00:09,200
恭喜
Congratulations.

1108
02:00:09,580 --> 02:00:11,250
安・派翠莎・霍华…
Anne Patricia Howard...

1109
02:00:11,540 --> 02:00:15,670
你愿意嫁给此人为妻？
...will you have this man to be your husband to live in marriage?

1110
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,590
你会爱他，照顾他，荣显他…
Will you love, comfort and honour him...

1111
02:00:18,800 --> 02:00:21,010
至死方休？
...for so long as you both shall live?

1112
02:00:21,590 --> 02:00:22,970
我愿意
I will.

1113
02:00:23,380 --> 02:00:26,790
佳百列・艾德华・马汀，你愿娶此女为妻…
Gabriel Edward Martin, will you have this woman to be your wife...

1114
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:29,470
共同生活吗？
...to live together in the covenant of marriage?

1115
02:00:29,850 --> 02:00:34,170
你会爱她，安慰她，荣显她至死方休吗？
Will you love, comfort and honour her as long as you both shall live?

1116
02:00:34,230 --> 02:00:35,270
我愿意
I will.

1117
02:00:35,520 --> 02:00:38,360
我依上帝…
Then by the power vested in me by our mutual faith...

1118
02:00:38,610 --> 02:00:40,480
赋予我的权力…
...in the Lord, our God...

1119
02:00:40,730 --> 02:00:44,030
宣布你们二人结为夫妻
...I now pronounce you man and wife.

1120
02:01:11,180 --> 02:01:13,430
抱歉没有早点告诉你
I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.

1121
02:01:13,640 --> 02:01:14,690
没关系
It's fine.

1122
02:01:15,270 --> 02:01:16,690
我有东西要给你
I have something for you.

1123
02:01:19,440 --> 02:01:21,150
这是佳百列他妈妈的
It belonged to Gabriel's mother.

1124
02:01:21,400 --> 02:01:23,110
好漂亮
It's beautiful.

1125
02:01:24,110 --> 02:01:25,320
让我来
Allow me.

1126
02:01:26,700 --> 02:01:28,160
这是北极星
It's the North Star.

1127
02:01:28,740 --> 02:01:32,330
是天空中唯一不会动的星星
That's the only star in the sky that never moves.

1128
02:01:32,620 --> 02:01:35,660
它永远不会动摇
It's constant, unwavering.

1129
02:01:36,170 --> 02:01:37,500
为人指引方向
A guide.

1130
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:42,590
我很荣幸
I'd be honoured.

1131
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:48,890
我可以吗？
May I?

1132
02:01:49,090 --> 02:01:51,180
你坚持的话　　我坚持
- If you must. - I must.

1133
02:02:07,450 --> 02:02:08,950
我能坐在你身边吗？
May I sit with you?

1134
02:02:09,110 --> 02:02:11,200
这是个自由的国家
It's a free country.

1135
02:02:11,950 --> 02:02:13,290
至少以后会是
Or at least it will be.

1136
02:02:25,630 --> 02:02:27,720
我不是我姐
I'm not my sister.

1137
02:02:28,760 --> 02:02:30,430
我知道
I know that.

1138
02:02:31,010 --> 02:02:32,600
是吗？
Do you?

1139
02:02:33,890 --> 02:02:35,430
是的
Yes, I do.

1140
02:02:36,480 --> 02:02:38,060
很好
Very well, then.

1141
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:43,520
怎么样？
Well?

1142
02:02:45,400 --> 02:02:46,650
什么怎么样？
Well what?

1143
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:10,630
我们很快就在潘布克见
I'll see you in Pembroke soon.

1144
02:03:10,930 --> 02:03:12,680
那不够快
Not soon enough.

1145
02:03:13,350 --> 02:03:15,260
我现在要靠你了…
I'm counting on you to make sure...

1146
02:03:15,470 --> 02:03:16,890
我知道　　知道什么？
- I know. - What?

1147
02:03:17,220 --> 02:03:21,770
帮我祷告，照顾每个人　　一点都没错
- Say my prayers, take care of everyone. - Couldn't have said it better.

1148
02:03:25,570 --> 02:03:26,610
再见
Goodbye.

1149
02:03:27,190 --> 02:03:28,360
再见
Goodbye.

1150
02:03:48,630 --> 02:03:49,880
再见，苏珊
Goodbye, Susan.

1151
02:03:52,340 --> 02:03:53,640
再见？
Goodbye?

1152
02:03:56,760 --> 02:03:58,430
我只要你说一句话就好了
Just one word, that's all I want.

1153
02:04:07,650 --> 02:04:08,730
好吧
All right.

1154
02:04:36,430 --> 02:04:37,850
爸爸！
Papa!

1155
02:04:40,520 --> 02:04:42,890
爸爸，别走！我什么都说
Papa, don't go! I'll say anything.

1156
02:04:47,610 --> 02:04:49,020
求求你，爸爸
Please, Papa.

1157
02:04:51,440 --> 02:04:53,490
你要我说什么，我就说什么
I'll say anything you want.

1158
02:04:53,700 --> 02:04:56,820
告诉我你要我说什么，我什么都说
Tell me what you want me to say. I'll say anything.

1159
02:04:59,700 --> 02:05:02,500
我保证，爸爸，不要走
I promise, Papa. Please don't go.

1160
02:05:03,620 --> 02:05:04,960
我保证
I promise.

1161
02:05:05,830 --> 02:05:07,290
我会回来的
I'll come back.

1162
02:05:08,130 --> 02:05:10,170
我会回来的，你相信我吗？
I'll come back. You believe me?

1163
02:05:13,590 --> 02:05:15,680
你让我非常快乐
You know, you make me very happy.

1164
02:05:51,630 --> 02:05:53,300
只有我们三个？
Just the three of us?

1165
02:05:53,840 --> 02:05:56,260
约翰・蓝斯金来过
John Raskin did come by earlier.

1166
02:05:57,090 --> 02:05:59,010
他看了看就走了
He looked around, then he left.

1167
02:06:00,100 --> 02:06:01,430
那就四个人了
He would've made four.

1168
02:06:01,930 --> 02:06:03,680
四个人会比较好
Four would have been better.

1169
02:06:38,970 --> 02:06:42,300
我再撑两个月就满一年了
I got another two months to go before I get to twelve months.

1170
02:06:47,730 --> 02:06:48,770
上校
Colonel.

1171
02:06:49,940 --> 02:06:51,230
牧师
Reverend.

1172
02:06:54,730 --> 02:06:56,190
相信法国人
Trust the French.

1173
02:06:56,900 --> 02:06:58,200
是，相信法国人
Yes, trust the French.

1174
02:06:58,400 --> 02:07:01,990
还有什么其它机会能杀红衫军？
Where else do I get the opportunity to kill a few Redcoats?

1175
02:07:02,530 --> 02:07:06,740
也许趁你不注意时，能杀几个受伤的
Perhaps a few wounded ones when you are not looking.

1176
02:07:32,350 --> 02:07:34,440
大家都到教堂去集合
Everyone must gather at the church.

1177
02:07:35,070 --> 02:07:36,110
威尔金先生？
Mr. Wilkins?

1178
02:07:37,570 --> 02:07:40,700
塔维顿上校有话对村民说
Colonel Tavington wishes to address the whole village.

1179
02:07:58,340 --> 02:08:02,790
本镇人民帮助班杰明・马汀和他的叛党
This town has given aid to Benjamin Martin and his rebels.

1180
02:08:03,050 --> 02:08:04,890
我要知道他的下落
I wish to know his whereabouts.

1181
02:08:06,350 --> 02:08:07,680
所以…
So...

1182
02:08:07,850 --> 02:08:09,850
只要有人说出他的下落…
...anyone who comes forward...

1183
02:08:10,180 --> 02:08:12,350
我就饶了他的叛国罪
...may be forgiven their treason.

1184
02:08:18,030 --> 02:08:19,070
好吧
Very well.

1185
02:08:19,280 --> 02:08:22,780
别说我没给过你们机会　　等等！
- You had your chance. - Wait!

1186
02:08:22,910 --> 02:08:25,320
他给过他们补给品　　安静！
- This man gives them supplies. - Quiet!

1187
02:08:25,320 --> 02:08:27,480
他带他们去黑沼泽　　他说谎！
- He brings them to Black Swamp. - Liar!

1188
02:08:27,490 --> 02:08:29,580
就在西班牙教会旁的沼泽
In the marsh, by the old Spanish mission.

1189
02:08:30,580 --> 02:08:31,750
这个人吗？
This man here?

1190
02:08:32,160 --> 02:08:34,120
是的　　你说黑沼泽？
- Yes. - The Black Swamp, you say?

1191
02:08:34,510 --> 02:08:37,510
就在西班牙教会旁的沼泽
By the old Spanish mission.

1192
02:08:38,590 --> 02:08:40,010
谢谢
Thank you very much.

1193
02:08:46,190 --> 02:08:47,730
把门关上
Shut the doors.

1194
02:08:49,940 --> 02:08:51,900
你说会原谅我们
But you said we'd be forgiven.

1195
02:08:52,110 --> 02:08:53,360
你是会被原谅！
And indeed you may!

1196
02:08:56,110 --> 02:08:57,780
那是你和上帝之间的事
That's between you and God.

1197
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:06,210
我们一定要坚强
Be strong. We must.

1198
02:09:08,290 --> 02:09:10,000
我们准备放火烧城了
I'll fire the town on your orders.

1199
02:09:10,170 --> 02:09:11,420
烧城？
The town?

1200
02:09:12,290 --> 02:09:13,840
把教堂放火烧了
Burn the church.

1201
02:09:16,380 --> 02:09:18,130
这样做太不磊落
There's no honour in this.

1202
02:09:20,470 --> 02:09:23,260
你不是说，任何背叛英国的人…
Didn't you say all those who stand against England...

1203
02:09:23,470 --> 02:09:25,980
都罪该万死吗？
...deserve to die a traitor's death?

1204
02:09:28,640 --> 02:09:31,230
放火烧教堂
Burn the church, captain.

1205
02:09:43,450 --> 02:09:44,490
把火把拿来
Give me the torch.

1206
02:10:27,540 --> 02:10:30,160
荣耀是来自结果，而不是手段
The honour is found in the end, not the means.

1207
02:10:31,460 --> 02:10:33,170
这一切会被忘记的
This will be forgotten.

1208
02:10:33,790 --> 02:10:35,040
波顿
Bordon.

1209
02:12:14,690 --> 02:12:15,980
安！
Anne!

1210
02:12:20,150 --> 02:12:21,820
霍尔夫人？
Mrs. Howard?

1211
02:12:25,990 --> 02:12:27,740
大家都到哪儿去了？
Where is everybody?

1212
02:12:32,660 --> 02:12:34,750
他们不在这里
They're not here.

1213
02:13:43,020 --> 02:13:44,570
佳百列走了
Gabriel's gone.

1214
02:14:29,860 --> 02:14:32,240
快去拿武器…！
To arms! To arms!

1215
02:18:51,870 --> 02:18:53,170
父亲
Father.

1216
02:18:54,590 --> 02:18:56,750
不要讲话…
Just don't talk. Don't talk.

1217
02:19:03,220 --> 02:19:04,350
父亲
Father.

1218
02:19:04,720 --> 02:19:07,060
我很抱歉　　安静
- I'm sorry. - Be quiet.

1219
02:19:07,260 --> 02:19:09,390
我会照顾你的，你不会有事的
I'll take care of you. You'll be all right.

1220
02:19:12,440 --> 02:19:16,020
托马斯的事我很抱歉
I'm sorry about Thomas.

1221
02:19:21,950 --> 02:19:24,280
儿子，那不是你的错
Oh, son, that wasn't your fault.

1222
02:19:28,370 --> 02:19:29,620
是我的错
That was mine.

1223
02:19:33,920 --> 02:19:37,040
忍着点，你不会有事的
Hold on. You're gonna be all right.

1224
02:19:39,840 --> 02:19:42,760
不要死，佳百列
Don't go. Gabriel, don't.

1225
02:20:11,830 --> 02:20:14,120
上帝，帮帮我…
Oh, God help me. God help me.

1226
02:20:48,200 --> 02:20:49,490
他在哪里？
Where is he?

1227
02:20:57,330 --> 02:20:59,340
我来帮你埋了他
I'll help you bury him.

1228
02:21:01,500 --> 02:21:02,840
我自己来
I'll bury him.

1229
02:21:06,090 --> 02:21:08,800
我太太怀孕了
My wife in Alexandria is with child.

1230
02:21:10,350 --> 02:21:11,930
是我们的第一胎
My first.

1231
02:21:12,680 --> 02:21:14,560
我为那孩子作战
I fight for that child.

1232
02:21:17,140 --> 02:21:19,690
班杰明，没有人能取代你儿子
Benjamin, nothing will replace your sons.

1233
02:21:21,020 --> 02:21:25,690
但如果你跟我们来，他们就不会白死
But if you come with us, you can justify their sacrifice.

1234
02:21:27,030 --> 02:21:28,450
为什么？
Why?

1235
02:21:30,200 --> 02:21:34,200
为何你们会觉得他们不会白死
Why do men feel they can justify death?

1236
02:21:40,790 --> 02:21:42,710
是傲慢还是…？
Is it arrogance or?

1237
02:21:47,380 --> 02:21:49,390
我长久以来的恐惧…
I have long feared...

1238
02:21:51,100 --> 02:21:55,640
就是我旧日的罪愆…会回来纠缠我
...that my sins would return to visit me.

1239
02:21:57,600 --> 02:22:00,230
代价之高，我无法承受
And the cost is more than I can bear.

1240
02:22:01,560 --> 02:22:05,400
班杰明，我们有机会
Benjamin, we have a chance.

1241
02:22:05,940 --> 02:22:09,160
葛林和丹摩根从维吉尼亚来了
Greene and Dan Morgan are down from Virginia.

1242
02:22:11,870 --> 02:22:15,410
如果我们打赢下一战，就胜利在望了
If we win this next battle, victory in the war is within our grasp.

1243
02:22:15,540 --> 02:22:16,580
那么，去吧
Go, then.

1244
02:22:16,910 --> 02:22:18,660
去追求你们的胜利
Seek your victory.

1245
02:22:22,080 --> 02:22:25,170
我不重要　　你错了，班杰明
- I'm small issue to it. - You're wrong, Benjamin.

1246
02:22:25,920 --> 02:22:27,920
你对你的手下…
You matter to your men...

1247
02:22:29,430 --> 02:22:31,180
和对其他人都很重要
...and to others as well.

1248
02:22:31,760 --> 02:22:33,550
你的胜利…
Your victories...

1249
02:22:33,760 --> 02:22:35,640
和失去的…
...and your losses...

1250
02:22:36,930 --> 02:22:39,190
大家都感同身受
...are shared by more than you know.

1251
02:22:40,270 --> 02:22:42,440
和我们一起吧
Stay with us.

1252
02:22:42,940 --> 02:22:44,730
为自由而战
Stay the course.

1253
02:22:54,660 --> 02:22:56,790
我已经为我的理由奋斗过了
I have run my course.

1254
02:23:16,810 --> 02:23:19,140
你的手下跟我们走
You men will be leaving with us.

1255
02:23:22,140 --> 02:23:23,690
准备出发
Prepare the baggage.

1256
02:24:28,210 --> 02:24:29,250
尚
Jean.

1257
02:25:27,770 --> 02:25:29,900
你明天不能上，上校
You will be missed tomorrow, colonel.

1258
02:25:30,230 --> 02:25:32,610
不能上？　你的伤
- Missed, my lord? - Your wound.

1259
02:25:33,860 --> 02:25:36,240
没关系的
It's nothing, my lord.

1260
02:25:36,570 --> 02:25:39,660
我随时准备效命
I am, as ever, ready to serve.

1261
02:25:39,820 --> 02:25:41,700
很好
Very well.

1262
02:25:41,870 --> 02:25:44,290
你最好可以
Make sure you do.

1263
02:25:44,830 --> 02:25:49,200
马上就能取得最大一场胜利，别让我失望
I stand on the eve of the greatest victory of my career. Don't fail me.

1264
02:25:49,210 --> 02:25:54,000
我的努力，不能把你弄来这里
My efforts in no small measure have brought you here.

1265
02:25:54,170 --> 02:25:55,800
我赐给你一次机会
I grant you that small measure...

1266
02:25:55,970 --> 02:25:59,470
虽然你没能把鬼带给我
...in spite of your failure to deliver the ghost to me.

1267
02:26:00,470 --> 02:26:02,100
从现在开始
Thus far.

1268
02:26:03,350 --> 02:26:06,390
我不会再容忍你由于…
I will not tolerate a premature charge...

1269
02:26:06,560 --> 02:26:10,400
渴求荣耀而产生的擅断
...born of your eagerness for glory.

1270
02:26:10,810 --> 02:26:14,190
等候我的命令
Wait for my order.

1271
02:26:14,570 --> 02:26:18,900
不然我就得抛弃所有俄亥俄州的希望
Or you may abandon any hope of Ohio.

1272
02:26:22,370 --> 02:26:25,540
明天的战役，将会改变整场战事
Tomorrow's battle can alter the course of the war.

1273
02:26:25,750 --> 02:26:28,750
葛林将军，我们究竟会遭遇何种情况？
General Greene, what exactly is the task before us?

1274
02:26:28,910 --> 02:26:32,040
各位，我们被康瓦理斯包围了
Gentlemen, Cornwallis has us cornered.

1275
02:26:32,710 --> 02:26:34,420
他的人数比我们多
Not only does he outnumber us...

1276
02:26:34,630 --> 02:26:37,670
我们的手下几乎全是民兵
...but nearly half of our force is militia.

1277
02:26:39,010 --> 02:26:41,300
他们靠不住
Unreliable, at best.

1278
02:26:41,640 --> 02:26:43,470
对不起，长官
Excuse me, sir.

1279
02:26:45,180 --> 02:26:46,930
你低估了我们的民兵
You underestimate our militia.

1280
02:26:49,140 --> 02:26:50,520
你们都一样
All of you do.

1281
02:26:51,310 --> 02:26:54,140
我们看过民兵防线接二连三地被击溃
We've seen our militia lines break time and again.

1282
02:26:54,190 --> 02:26:55,820
克比斯湾，普林斯顿
Kips Bay, Princeton.

1283
02:26:56,030 --> 02:26:58,110
但英国人也这么想
But the British have seen that too.

1284
02:26:59,150 --> 02:27:02,950
康瓦理斯的信中，完全看不起民兵
Cornwallis' own letters bear out that he has no respect for the militia.

1285
02:27:03,700 --> 02:27:06,080
你有何建议？
What are you suggesting, Ben?

1286
02:27:07,500 --> 02:27:09,410
我建议我们利用这点
I'm suggesting we use that.

1287
02:27:16,590 --> 02:27:20,590
我知道你们已经牺牲了很多
I know you men have sacrificed a lot so far.

1288
02:27:20,800 --> 02:27:24,180
但我只要求你们…
But all I'm asking is that you...

1289
02:27:24,390 --> 02:27:27,560
让前两排的民兵开两枪
...let the front line of the militia fire two shots tomorrow.

1290
02:27:29,730 --> 02:27:33,100
发射两轮子弹期间，可能会发生很多事
A lot can happen in the time it takes to fire two shots.

1291
02:27:33,100 --> 02:27:35,560
特别是在对抗英国正规军时
Especially against British Regulars.

1292
02:27:36,570 --> 02:27:40,320
没错，所以我才不叫你们开三枪
Indeed. That's why I'm not asking you to fire three.

1293
02:28:37,460 --> 02:28:39,840
如果我死的话，至少死得体面
If I die, I will die well dressed.

1294
02:29:26,050 --> 02:29:27,180
开火！
Fire!

1295
02:29:31,010 --> 02:29:33,890
大队！　停！
- Battalion! - Company, halt!

1296
02:29:50,990 --> 02:29:52,080
哈利…
Harry...

1297
02:29:53,040 --> 02:29:55,000
麻烦把这给我的孩子们
...will you give this to my children?

1298
02:30:05,550 --> 02:30:06,720
谢谢
Thank you.

1299
02:30:15,930 --> 02:30:17,640
现在是十月
It's October now.

1300
02:30:20,270 --> 02:30:21,440
我知道
I know.

1301
02:30:22,440 --> 02:30:24,360
现在已经超过十二个月了
It's more than 12 months.

1302
02:30:24,820 --> 02:30:26,110
你自由了
You're a free man.

1303
02:30:27,280 --> 02:30:30,070
我自愿留下来
I'm here now on my own accord.

1304
02:30:33,910 --> 02:30:36,000
你愿留下来我很荣幸
I'm honoured to have you with us.

1305
02:30:38,330 --> 02:30:39,580
真的很荣幸
Honoured.

1306
02:30:41,210 --> 02:30:43,750
举枪！
Shoulder arms!

1307
02:30:49,470 --> 02:30:51,090
前进…
Forward...

1308
02:30:51,890 --> 02:30:53,180
齐步走！
...march!

1309
02:30:58,140 --> 02:30:59,940
你女儿几岁了？
How old were your daughters?

1310
02:31:02,020 --> 02:31:04,520
维尔莉特十二，宝琳十岁
Violette was 12 and Pauline, 10.

1311
02:31:05,690 --> 02:31:07,650
他们的眼睛都是绿的
They had green eyes.

1312
02:31:08,940 --> 02:31:10,700
她们一定很可爱
I'm sure they were lovely.

1313
02:31:12,360 --> 02:31:14,160
没错
Yes, they were.

1314
02:31:25,880 --> 02:31:27,090
大队！　注意！
- Battalion! - Company!

1315
02:31:27,460 --> 02:31:28,630
齐步走！
March!

1316
02:31:30,840 --> 02:31:32,130
瞄准！
Fire!

1317
02:31:34,890 --> 02:31:36,140
除非我在做梦…
Unless I'm dreaming...

1318
02:31:36,850 --> 02:31:41,680
我好像看到…他们队伍中央居然是民兵
...I believe I see militia forming at their centre.

1319
02:31:55,240 --> 02:31:57,580
大队！停！
Battalion, halt!

1320
02:32:15,720 --> 02:32:17,560
第一排向前！
Dress ranks!

1321
02:32:26,360 --> 02:32:27,860
准备！
Make ready!

1322
02:32:39,580 --> 02:32:41,410
大队！
Battalion!

1323
02:32:41,620 --> 02:32:42,660
停！
Halt!

1324
02:32:45,750 --> 02:32:46,920
瞄准！
Take aim!

1325
02:32:50,420 --> 02:32:51,460
开火！
Fire!

1326
02:33:02,560 --> 02:33:03,640
开火！
Fire!

1327
02:33:24,660 --> 02:33:25,920
不要走散！
Hold the line!

1328
02:33:31,880 --> 02:33:35,130
准备进攻！　我们还没有接到命令！
- Prepare to charge! - We haven't been given that order.

1329
02:33:35,380 --> 02:33:36,760
进攻！
Charge!

1330
02:33:37,930 --> 02:33:39,010
进攻！
Charge!

1331
02:33:42,560 --> 02:33:43,930
塔维顿
Tavington.

1332
02:33:44,140 --> 02:33:46,350
他真该死！该死！
Damn him! Damn that man!

1333
02:33:48,230 --> 02:33:49,730
瞄准！
Make ready.

1334
02:33:50,310 --> 02:33:51,820
开火！
Take aim!

1335
02:33:52,690 --> 02:33:53,730
开火！
Fire!

1336
02:33:55,030 --> 02:33:56,240
开火！
Take aim!

1337
02:33:57,280 --> 02:33:59,620
开火！ 撤退！
Fire! Retreat!

1338
02:34:05,620 --> 02:34:09,670
上刺刀，看看鹿死谁手
Bayonet charge. We'll see who takes the glory from this field.

1339
02:34:10,040 --> 02:34:11,630
进攻！
Charge!

1340
02:34:31,520 --> 02:34:32,730
恭喜你，大人
Congratulations, my lord.

1341
02:34:33,150 --> 02:34:34,780
叫步兵储备军过来
Infantry reserve into the centre.

1342
02:34:34,820 --> 02:34:36,280
我们已经占领了此地
But you've taken the field.

1343
02:34:36,490 --> 02:34:37,860
现在我们要打垮他们的士气
Now we'll take their spirits.

1344
02:34:37,950 --> 02:34:41,070
叫我们的士兵去击溃他们
Send the battalion over that hill and crush them.

1345
02:34:41,320 --> 02:34:42,780
战争今天就要结束
It ends today.

1346
02:35:06,060 --> 02:35:07,140
暂停进攻！
Hold the charge!

1347
02:35:08,180 --> 02:35:09,230
开火！
Fire!

1348
02:35:09,480 --> 02:35:11,770
暂停进攻！
Hold the charge!

1349
02:35:15,480 --> 02:35:16,900
开火！
Fire!

1350
02:35:22,450 --> 02:35:23,530
瞄准！
Take aim!

1351
02:35:25,200 --> 02:35:26,830
开火！
Fire!

1352
02:35:35,090 --> 02:35:36,630
进攻！
Charge!

1353
02:35:43,470 --> 02:35:45,050
上刺刀！
Charge bayonets!

1354
02:36:14,250 --> 02:36:15,420
等等！不要走散！
Halt!

1355
02:36:16,630 --> 02:36:18,050
等等！不要走散！
Hold! Dress your ranks!

1356
02:36:20,670 --> 02:36:21,880
开火！
Fire!

1357
02:36:25,340 --> 02:36:26,930
进攻！
Charge!

1358
02:36:50,580 --> 02:36:52,250
撤退！
Retreat!

1359
02:36:57,500 --> 02:36:58,590
上校！
Colonel!

1360
02:37:00,500 --> 02:37:01,840
我们的军队要瓦解了！
The line is faltering!

1361
02:37:03,380 --> 02:37:05,890
撤退…
Retreat! Retreat!

1362
02:37:13,770 --> 02:37:15,190
等等！
Wait!

1363
02:37:15,980 --> 02:37:17,730
不要撤退！
No retreat!

1364
02:37:21,530 --> 02:37:23,740
保持队形！
Hold the line!

1365
02:37:25,360 --> 02:37:27,490
保持队形！
Hold the line!

1366
02:37:39,210 --> 02:37:42,250
推进！
Push forward, men!

1367
02:38:31,720 --> 02:38:34,010
叫炮兵到中间集合！
Artillery, concentrate on the centre.

1368
02:38:49,240 --> 02:38:51,240
如果我们重新整队朝右前进
If we reform and wheel right,

1369
02:38:51,240 --> 02:38:53,240
也许能逼他们撤退
we may be able to turn their flank.

1370
02:38:53,240 --> 02:38:55,160
你想得美，将军
You dream, general.

1371
02:41:57,680 --> 02:42:01,050
拜托你在战争结束之前杀了我
Kill me before the war is over, will you?

1372
02:42:01,890 --> 02:42:04,560
看来你…
It appears you are not...

1373
02:42:04,770 --> 02:42:06,980
还是不如我
...the better man.

1374
02:42:20,660 --> 02:42:21,700
你说得对
You're right.

1375
02:42:26,500 --> 02:42:28,620
我的儿子比你好多了
My sons were better men.

1376
02:42:56,360 --> 02:42:57,820
叫他们撤退
Sound the retreat.

1377
02:43:01,370 --> 02:43:02,830
叫他们…
Sound...

1378
02:43:03,950 --> 02:43:05,160
撤退
...retreat.

1379
02:43:23,180 --> 02:43:24,220
亲爱的夏绿蒂
Dear Charlotte:

1380
02:43:24,970 --> 02:43:26,600
战事已经改观
The war has turned.

1381
02:43:26,930 --> 02:43:30,440
康瓦理斯将军带着手下逃向北方
General Cornwallis took flight with his army and moved north.

1382
02:43:30,600 --> 02:43:33,810
我们持续与英军交战在未来数月间…
We continued to engage the British, and in the following months...

1383
02:43:33,900 --> 02:43:37,230
康瓦理斯会被困在维吉尼亚州约克镇
...Cornwallis entrenched himself at Yorktown, Virginia.

1384
02:43:38,110 --> 02:43:41,660
约克镇，1781年

1385
02:43:38,860 --> 02:43:41,030
乔治・华盛顿悄悄地突围到北方
Washington escaped from the north...

1386
02:43:41,200 --> 02:43:44,780
包围了康瓦理斯，他无法撤退至海上
...and surrounded Cornwallis, who could not retreat to the seas.

1387
02:43:44,780 --> 02:43:48,200
因为我们期待已久的朋友终于抵达
It was blocked off by our long-lost friends...

1388
02:43:48,250 --> 02:43:50,580
挡住他的去路
...who had finally arrived.

1389
02:43:55,250 --> 02:43:56,670
法国万岁
Vive la France.

1390
02:43:59,380 --> 02:44:00,970
自由万岁
Vive la liberté.

1391
02:44:13,150 --> 02:44:15,020
大人，我求你
My lord, I beseech you.

1392
02:44:15,610 --> 02:44:17,900
你一定要下令投降
You must order the surrender.

1393
02:44:18,730 --> 02:44:22,560
怎么可能会变成这样？他们只是杂牌军
How could it come to this? An army of rabble.

1394
02:44:22,570 --> 02:44:23,950
庄稼汉
Peasants.

1395
02:44:26,030 --> 02:44:28,120
一切都会不同
Everything will change.

1396
02:44:31,620 --> 02:44:33,620
一切都不同了
Everything has changed.

派他的手下前来投降

1400

战争就要结束，民兵团即将解散…

1401

我希望这么多人的牺牲…

能够让我们的新国家诞生

告诉孩子们，尤其要告诉苏珊
Tell the children, and especially Susan,

1406
02:45:05,600 --> 02:45:07,400
我会遵守诺言…

1407
02:45:07,410 --> 02:45:10,870
我很快就会回到你们身边

回家，从头开始

你太太就快生了，对吧？

她三周前生了个儿子

1412
02:45:28,550 --> 02:45:29,930
你帮他取什么名字？
What'd you name him?

1413
02:45:32,020 --> 02:45:34,020
我们叫他佳百列

1414

谢谢，哈利

1415

我们会建立一个全新的世界

我想我们就从这里开始…

从你们的家开始
