288
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:37,391
你好好照顾自己就好。
You just take care of yourself.

289
00:37:52,229 --> 00:37:53,229
上帝该死。
God dammit.

290
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:01,779
什么……
What the...

291
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:08,035
你的母亲!
You mother!

292
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,831
我要杀了你，狗娘养的!
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!

293
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:14,918
这到底是怎么回事?
What the hell?

294
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,270
什么……
What the...

295
00:38:40,694 --> 00:38:41,694
不,不。

299
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:16,188
-他们杀了他!

300
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:11,576
-比利，我觉得我有问题。
- Billy, I think there's something wrong with me.

301
00:40:11,577 --> 00:40:14,161
我能在事情发生之前就感知到。
I can sense things before they even happen.

302
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:15,830
我在公寓里找东西。
I find things in the apartment.

303
00:40:15,831 --> 00:40:18,040
我都不知道它们是从哪来的。
And I don't even know where they came from.

304
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:19,251
看看这个。
Look at this.

305
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:22,296
——耶稣!
- Jesus!

306
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:24,630
你怎么知道的?
How did you get that?

307
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:25,715
-我不记得了
- I don't remember.

308
00:40:25,716 --> 00:40:26,550
-什么叫你不记得了?
- What do you mean you don't remember?

309
00:40:26,551 --> 00:40:28,510
-我不记得了。
- I mean I don't remember.

310
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:31,429
我脑子一片空白好几个小时。
I go blank for hours.

311
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:32,639
甚至更长时间。
Maybe even longer.

312
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:38,061
我觉得有人在逼我做事。
I feel like there's somebody making me do things.

313
00:40:40,314 --> 00:40:41,981
我不想做的事情。
Things that I don't wanna do.

314
00:40:41,982 --> 00:40:44,359
-那就做点什么。
- Then do something about it.

315
00:40:45,235 --> 00:40:47,946
-亲爱的，我不知道该怎么办。
- Honey, I don't know what to do.

316
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:53,785
-我会帮你的，宝贝。
- I'll help you sweetheart.

317
00:41:02,753 --> 00:41:05,630
-医学上你是个很健康的年轻女人
- Medically you're a very fit young woman.

318
00:41:05,631 --> 00:41:08,674
没有任何大脑异常的迹象。
No evidence of any abnormality in the brain.

319
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:09,717
没有肿瘤。
No tumor.

320
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:11,218
你有一颗坚强的心。
You have a strong heart.

321
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:13,596
你的饮食比一般人好。
Your diet is better than average.

322
00:41:13,597 --> 00:41:16,390
当然，你的压力很大。
You are under severe stress of course.

323
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:22,271
但除此之外，boland医生，你看的那个精神病医生，说没有什么异常。
But otherwise, doctor boland, the psychiatrist you saw, says there's nothing out of the ordinary.

324
00:41:22,272 --> 00:41:25,566
除了你特殊的感官知觉。
Aside from your exceptional extra sensory perception.

325
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:28,070
还有你对日本文化的痴迷。
And your pre-occupation with Japanese culture.

326
00:41:29,655 --> 00:41:30,739
这没什么坏处。
No harm in that.

327
00:41:36,745 --> 00:41:38,037
——请问?
- Excuse me?

328
00:41:38,038 --> 00:41:39,205
你看到西科德警官了吗?
Have you seen officer Secord?

329
00:41:39,206 --> 00:41:40,248
-不，我没有。
- No I haven't.

330
00:41:59,059 --> 00:42:02,311
-好吧，我们就看看是谁让我这么做的。
- Oh well, we'll just see who put me up to it.

331
00:42:02,312 --> 00:42:03,146
我们要和你一起去吗?
So are we going with you?

332
00:42:03,147 --> 00:42:05,272
-你知道我真正想做什么吗?
- You know what I really want to do?

333
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:06,899
我想坐警车去。
I wanna go in a police car.

334
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:07,900
我也是，我也是!
- Me too, me too!

335
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:10,695
我能打开警笛和警灯吗?
Can I put on the siren and the lights?

336
00:42:10,696 --> 00:42:12,655
-马上就把我打倒了。
- Shot me down right away.

337
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:31,048
- - - - - -来吧。——好吧,好吧!
- Come on. - Okay, okay!

338
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:50,067
-我去拿。
- I'll get it.

339
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:51,695
你们就坐在那里。
You guys just sit there.

340
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:55,197
这是谁呢?
Who could this be?

341
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:56,198
这是疯狂的。
This is crazy.

342
00:42:57,909 --> 00:42:58,909
哦,嗨。
Oh hi.

343
00:42:58,910 --> 00:42:59,745
进来吧。
Come on in.

344
00:42:59,746 --> 00:43:00,946
我们还需要一些毛巾。
We could use some more towels.

345
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:05,875
哦很热。
Ooh it's hot.

346
00:43:05,876 --> 00:43:06,876
不要拉我。
Don't pull me.

347
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:10,755
这感觉很好。
This feels good.

348
00:43:10,756 --> 00:43:11,798
我们玩得很开心!
We've been having fun!

349
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,640
——她是谁?
- Who's she?

350
00:43:23,018 --> 00:43:24,935
我不知道。
I don't know.

351
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:25,812
但它是好的。
But it's alright.

352
00:43:25,813 --> 00:43:27,939
-你最好小心点，大个子!

353
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:34,112
这到底是个什么地方?

354
00:43:37,574 --> 00:43:38,575
-滚开，婊子!

355
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:43,871
这是怎么呢
What's going on?

356
00:43:43,872 --> 00:43:44,831
呀。
Jeez.

357
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:45,791
来吧孩子。

那狗娘养的归你了。

362
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,813
她对他做了什么?

363
00:44:08,814 --> 00:44:09,648
-我不知道。

366
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:17,321
他怎么了?
What's the matter with him?

367
00:44:18,199 --> 00:44:20,241
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

368
00:44:20,242 --> 00:44:21,242
——不!

克里斯蒂?
Christie?

371
00:45:26,183 --> 00:45:27,100
你到底去哪儿了?

372
00:45:27,101 --> 00:45:29,476
我到处找你。

373
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:30,477
克里斯蒂?

这是怎么回事?
What is going on?

376

00:45:45,118 --> 00:45:46,328
-我不知道。
- I don't know.

378
00:45:47,287 --> 00:45:48,121
-你得知道。
- You gotta know.

379
00:45:48,122 --> 00:45:49,372
你中午就走了。

380
00:45:53,335 --> 00:45:56,879
-比利，我不管这些医生怎么说。

381
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,006
我有问题。
There's something wrong with me.

382
00:45:59,007 --> 00:46:00,091
我试着与它抗争。

00:46:08,308 --> 00:46:09,517
有个人,比利。

我能感觉到它就在房间里，有时就在我身边。

387
00:46:18,485 --> 00:46:19,319
——倾听。

388
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,279
有个军官在亚洲分部。
There's an officer in the asiatic division.

389
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:25,824
他告诉我市中心有个日本人很崇拜的人。
He told me there's this guy downtown the local Japanese swear by.

-我也不知道
- Well neither do I.

392
00:46:34,501 --> 00:46:38,171
但当你失去记忆时，我们不知道该相信什么，不是吗?
But when you blank out, we don't know what to believe in do we?

393
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:52,519
-比利，我不认为这是个好主意。
- Billy, I don't think this is such a good idea.

394
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:57,564
——冥界。我叫比利·西科德。

以防幽灵生气。

407
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:21,274
-他都不问问我有什么问题吗?

408
00:48:22,984 --> 00:48:24,027
——我们只想放松一下。

409
00:48:24,986 --> 00:48:26,446
-退后，离开她

410
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:30,199
-别担心，甜心。

411
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,200

413
00:50:24,022 --> 00:50:25,272

00:50:25,273 --> 00:50:26,273
——是的。

418
00:50:42,832 --> 00:50:43,832
-天啊。

-我必须服从神灵。

426
00:51:34,259 --> 00:51:36,885
他希望我放了她。

427
00:51:36,886 --> 00:51:37,886
——不!
- No!

454
00:53:57,652 --> 00:53:59,486
什么也做不了。

-我觉得他不知道自己在做什么。

504
01:03:30,057 --> 01:03:32,392
他让我躺在绿色的牧场上。

他领我在可安歇的水边。

你的杖，你的竿，都安慰我。
Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.

510
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:51,537
在我仇敌面前，你为我摆设筵席。

我的杯子溢出。
