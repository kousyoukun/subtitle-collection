Do you need any help?

[Speaking japanese]

62
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,170
You didn't see any kind of a weapon?
Not even a gun or a knife?

63
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,530
No..
Lying nearby maybe?

64
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,080
I told you. He was dead when I found him.

65
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,210
But are you sure?

66
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,550
I didn't examine him. I'm not a paramedic for christ sakes.

67
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,100
What is this anyway?

68
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:44,950
Calm down.

69
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,550
Now, this man murdered a very important scientist -

70
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,490
killed security guards, police men -

71
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:51,080
and we know nothing about him.

72
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,440
Give her a break lieutenant.

73
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,440
Alright?

74
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,310
Yeah, OK.

75
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,890
Look, miss Ryder, you may go now.

76
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,810
You keep in touch.

77
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,420
Rough day, huh?

78
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:12,150
Yeah, thanks, but I don't use soft-drinks.

79
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,210
How about some coffee?

80
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,690
No.

81
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,020
Whiskey?

82
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,440
A daiquiri?

83
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,260
Sorry.

84
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,110
Pizza?

85
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:21,600
Taco?

86
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,510
How about some candy?

87
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,690
Are you alright?

88
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,250
Yeah I'm OK. I just need to be alone.

89
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,340
Let me take you home.

90
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,440
No!

91
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,840
Look, you get this straight. I don't go out with cops, alright?

92
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,230
The name is Secord.

93
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,880
Billy Secord.

94
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,990
I'll be in touch.

95
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,760
Oh christ.

96
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,100
God is she beautiful.

97
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,030
No, no, no, no, no.

98
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,300
Hello?

99
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,590
Yeah, she's right here.

101
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,090

Fine.

103
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,150
Sorry, I've got an aerobics class.

104
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,480
No, I'm not gonna tell you where it's at.

105
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:01,460
Hey look, would you just lay off it buddy. It's just not in the cards alright?

106
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,500
What a friend you are..

107
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,910
Hey Christie.

108
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,090
What the hell is this?

109
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,830
You got this to kill the cop with or something?

110
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,550
Most people prefer guns you know.

111
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,790
Come on let's go. We're gonna be late.

143
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:47,570
You mean you went all the way to my aerobics class just to tell me that?

144
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,570
You still won't make it easy will you?

145
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:51,970
Oh. So now it should be easy?

Just this once. So..

How about some coffee?

148
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,520
You know coffee is really bad for your health?

149

165
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:16,580
Get your hands off of me!

166
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,480
Come on!

167
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,820
What do you want?

168
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:58,080
Just keep quiet and move your butt. You're under arrest.

169
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,040
Look. If you're gonna book me. Then book me.

170
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,760
Otherwise just don't bother me anymore.

171
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:05,230
Oh I'm not gonna arrest you.

172
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,970
I just wanna take you back to my old neighborhood.

173
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,970
There's a guy there I want you to beat up for me.

174
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,700
<i>Would you stop the car?</i>

175
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,380
<i>Oh come on. I'm only teasing you.</i>

176
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,070
<i>Stop the car!</i>

177
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,920
Look Christie I'm only trying to help.

178
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,100
You'd get charged for assault for what you did to those guys.

179
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,100
Well that's my problem.

180
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,050
And I don't need any help.

181
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:28,940
Especially from you, officer Secord.

182
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:37,790
You know. I am sick and tired of hearing about how you don't like cops.

183
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:40,730
Because I wanna tell you something, miss Independence.

184
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,330
I like being a cop.

185
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,530
And if you don't wanna go out with me just 'cause I'm a cop -

186
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,660
Then to hell with you, lady.

187
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,190
You can go now.

188
00:25:59,060 --> 00:25:59,980
Listen..

189
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:03,270
I don't have any coffee in my apartment -

190
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,770
But I do have some V-8 juice.

191
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,050
Would you like to take me home?

That was quite a show you put on in your car.

207
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:21,790
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to get so angry.

208

That's OK.

209
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:26,280
You're very sexy when you get angry.

Oh god.

211
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:14,950
<i>Christie?</i>

212
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,900
What are you doing?

213
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,350
Nothing.

214
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,230
I just couldn't sleep.

215
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,740
I had a nightmare so I decided to put some clothes away.

216
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,690
God. This is beautiful.

217
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:39,400
Where did you get this?

218
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,890
It's Japanese.

219
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,340
One of these days I'm gonna hang it on my wall.

220
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,090
You're full of surprises aren't ya?

<i>Local flight 21: Non stop into Tokyo now boarding at gate 22.</i>

223
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,850
It is an honor to be your guest.

224
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,900
The honor is ours, Yamada san.

225
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:28,890
I'm grateful for the letter you sent me to Japan.

226
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,110
We have bad news, Yamada san.

227
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:32,780
But we'll talk later.

228
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,220
Hi! What's wrong?

229
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,910
I gotta break our date. They gave me off-duty work.

230
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,940
That's OK.

231
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,500
Are you alright?

232
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:14,030
Listen. I gotta drive Case back. I'll call you later OK?

233
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:15,640
Sure.

234
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,100
Bye.

235
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,710
Hey!

236
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:33,700
Christie!

237
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:23,230
Billy? Where in the hell are you for christ sakes!

238
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,450
What's the matter with you?
<i>Stop it Billy..</i>

239
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:28,560
It's just that I'm feeling really weird.

240
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,310
Just go to sleep. And I'll be there by morning.

241
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,010
Never mind. I'll be OK.

242
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,650
<i>You just take care of yourself.</i>

243
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,870
Son of a bitch.

244
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,360
God dammit.

245
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:02,130
What the..

246
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:10,870
You mother.. I'll kill you. You son of a bitch!

247
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:15,140
What the hell..

248
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:34,930
What the..

249
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,460
No. No..

250
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,320
No. Please. No. No. Please.

251
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:51,210
Please. Oh. God.

252
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:10,150
<i>Billy, I think there's something wrong with me.</i>

253
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,480
I can sense things before they even happen.

254
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,360
<i>I find things in the apartment.</i>

255
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,970
<i>And I don't even know where they came from.</i>

256
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,190
<i>Look at this.</i>

257
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,140
Jesus!

258
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,250
How did you get that?

259
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,380
I don't remember.

260
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,510
What do you mean you don't remember?

261
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:29,510
I mean I don't remember.

262
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:32,970
I go blank. For hours. Maybe even longer.

263
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,730
I feel like there's somebody making me do things.

264
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:42,130
Things that I don't wanna do.

265
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,220
Then do something about it.

266
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,170
Honey, I don't know what to do.

267
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,910
I'll help you sweetheart.

268
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:05,550
Medically you're a very fit young woman.

269
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:08,710
No evidence of any abnormality in the brain.

270
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,350
<i>No tumor.</i>

271
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,870
<i>You have a strong heart.</i>

272
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,730
<i>Your diet is better than average.</i>

273
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,510
You are under severe stress of course.

274
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:20,390
But otherwise, doctor Boland, the psychiatrist you saw, says -

275
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:22,320
Says there's nothing out of the ordinary.

276
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:25,790
<i>Aside from your exceptional extra sensory perception.</i>

277
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,740
<i>And your pre-occupation with Japanese culture.</i>

278
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,460
No harm in that.

279
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,660
Excuse me?

280
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,890
Have you seen officer Secord?

281
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:40,750
No I haven't.

282
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,590
Oh well, we'll just see who put me up to it.

283
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,020
<i>So are we going with you?</i>

284
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:05,520
<i>Heck yes..</i>

285
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:07,500
<i>I wanna go in a police car.</i>

286
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,500
<i>Well good..</i>

287
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,640
<i> Can I put on the siren and the lights?</i>

288
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:50,870
Oh I'll get it.

289
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:52,780
You guys just sit there.

290
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,680
Who could this be? This is crazy.

291
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:01,260
Oh hi. Come on in. We could use some more towels.

292
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:07,450
Ooh it's hot. Don't pull me..

293
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,280
<i>This feels good. We've been having fun..</i>

294
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:22,860
Who's she?

295
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:26,330
<i>I don't know. But it's alright.</i>

296
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:28,970
<i>You better watch yourself big man!</i>

297
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,730
What the hell kind of place is this?

298
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,720
Beat it bitch!

299
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,480
<i>What's going on?</i>

300
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,380
<i>Jeez..</i>

301
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,990
Go ahead kid. The son of bitch is all yours.

302
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:53,300
<i>Oh let's split..</i>

303
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,940
<i>No. I wanna watch.</i>

304
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:57,990
<i>This guy is a real jerk.</i>

305
00:43:58,700 --> 00:43:59,960
<i>Boy. You said it.</i>

306
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:05,240
<i>Let's get outta here.</i>

307
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:08,960
What is she doing to him?

308
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:12,220
I don't know. But the bastard seems to be enjoying it doesn't he?

309
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,820
<i>Sure is.</i>

310
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:15,970
<i>Hey. What's the matter with him?</i>

311
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:19,520
No! What are you doing?

312
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:22,010
No!

313
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:15,570
Christie?

314
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:25,960
<i>Christie?</i>

315
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,480
Where the hell have you been? I looked everywhere for you.

316
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:31,140
<i>Christie?</i>

317
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:39,410
Christie?

318
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:44,150
What is going on? Where have you been?

319
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:46,960
I don't know.

320
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,010
You gotta know. You've been gone since noon.

321
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,920
Billy, I don't care what these doctors say.

322
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,290
There's something wrong with me.

323
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:01,350
<i>I try to fight it.</i>

324
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:04,690
But I can't even remember what.

325
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,410
Or why.

326
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:10,990
There's somebody, Billy.

327

01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:10,820
<i>Billy you scared me.</i>

495
01:14:11,090 --> 01:14:12,570
God, I'm so glad you're here..

496
01:14:12,590 --> 01:14:13,860
Don't move.

497
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:15,050
What are you doing?

498
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:16,820
I said just don't move.

499
01:14:18,210 --> 01:14:19,720
They're all dead Christie..

500
01:14:20,510 --> 01:14:22,020
You killed them.

501
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:24,270
I saw everything.

502
01:14:24,270 --> 01:14:25,940
I haven't killed anybody..

503
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:27,570
Listen to me -

504
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:29,800
There's a man here from Japan.

505
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:31,940
A ninja.

506
01:14:32,190 --> 01:14:34,320
We're gonna go meet him at that old temple on the hill.

507
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:36,730
And he is going to help you.

508
01:14:38,250 --> 01:14:40,100
I can.. - Don't move!

509
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:43,020
I could never do anything to hurt you..

510
01:14:44,430 --> 01:14:45,990
Oh god I hope that's true.

511
01:14:47,970 --> 01:14:49,600
Put your hands out in front of you.

512
01:14:50,180 --> 01:14:51,030
But Billy..

513
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:53,030
Put your hands out in front of you!

514
01:14:57,020 --> 01:14:58,570
I love you..

515
01:15:20,090 --> 01:15:21,290
Christie no..

516
01:15:22,180 --> 01:15:23,600
<i>Christie no.</i>

517
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:25,660
Christie!!

518
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:15,890
Wake up now. Come on. Come on.

519
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:22,740
Damn!

520
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:15,060
[Speaking Japanese]

521
01:18:09,410 --> 01:18:10,960
You're the ninja.

522
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:12,640
You can help me?

523
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:13,720
Yes.

524
01:18:13,790 --> 01:18:16,410
Is it true that only a ninja can destroy a ninja?

525
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:17,620
It's true.

526
01:18:17,620 --> 01:18:20,180
Help me please. I must get rid of him.

527
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:23,630
Do you know what I must do?

528
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:26,870
Do what you have to. I don't wanna hurt anyone else.

529
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:28,110
It might be dangerous for you.

530
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:31,310
Will I die?

531
01:18:31,310 --> 01:18:33,180
Not if the spirit leaves you.

532
01:18:33,670 --> 01:18:35,310
And returns to his body.

533
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:37,590
<i>Then I will destroy him.</i>

534
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:39,910
<i>And you will be safe.</i>

535
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:43,750
And if it doesn't -

536
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:45,760
You'll kill me.

537
01:22:45,990 --> 01:22:47,270
Oh no..

538
01:22:57,980 --> 01:22:59,260
Come on Christie.

539
01:23:00,650 --> 01:23:01,670
Come on.

540
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:07,140
Billy?

541
01:23:14,020 --> 01:23:15,650
I think I'm gonna be alright now..

542
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:18,840
Oh I love you!

543
01:23:20,810 --> 01:23:22,190
I love you.

544
01:23:37,250 --> 01:23:38,360
Billy wait.

545
01:26:15,790 --> 01:26:16,710
Christie no!

546
01:28:51,230 --> 01:28:52,590
It's over now.
