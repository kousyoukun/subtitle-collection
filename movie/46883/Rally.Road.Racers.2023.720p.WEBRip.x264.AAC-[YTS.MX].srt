3
00:00:55,707 --> 00:00:58,188
So it's the last
day of the Bonzer Rally

4
00:00:58,232 --> 00:00:59,798
here in the Land Down Under.

5
00:00:59,842 --> 00:01:04,542
And Archie Vainglorious is
still the driver to beat.

6
00:01:13,377 --> 00:01:14,900
Oh, come on.

7
00:01:14,944 --> 00:01:17,033
It looks like
Team Hot Spots race has just

8
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,208
been cut short.

9
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,519
Ha ha!

10
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:29,959
What did I tell you, folks?

11
00:01:30,002 --> 00:01:32,657
Nobody's been able to
get close to Vainglorious

12
00:01:32,701 --> 00:01:37,575
since the amazing Gnash
mysteriously stopped racing.

13
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:38,881
Thank you.

14
00:01:38,924 --> 00:01:40,274
So that's
one more rally cap

15
00:01:40,317 --> 00:01:44,452
for Archie Vainglorious.

16
00:01:44,495 --> 00:01:47,585
Legend, champ.

17
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:51,502
One day, I'm going
to be the champ.

18
00:01:51,546 --> 00:01:53,852
Rebel.

19
00:02:10,782 --> 00:02:11,261
Yeah!

20
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:14,743
Woo-hoo!

21
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:20,401
Yeah!

22
00:02:20,444 --> 00:02:27,799
Once again, it's time for the
annual Slow Loris Day Festival

23
00:02:27,843 --> 00:02:28,887
here in the--

24
00:02:28,931 --> 00:02:31,194
Yeah!

25
00:02:31,238 --> 00:02:31,760
Wahoo!

26
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,941
Coming through!

27
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:48,559
Yeah!

28
00:02:48,603 --> 00:02:49,125
Waah!

29
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,912
We have a new champion!

30
00:02:53,956 --> 00:02:55,610
The crowd is going wild!

31
00:02:55,653 --> 00:02:57,655
The crown is on its--

32
00:02:57,699 --> 00:02:58,178
oh.

33
00:03:01,093 --> 00:03:01,746
Weirdo.

34
00:03:04,488 --> 00:03:06,621
How shameful for your granny.

35
00:03:11,278 --> 00:03:14,194
That was the coolest
thing I've ever seen.

36
00:03:14,237 --> 00:03:14,933
Really?

37
00:03:14,977 --> 00:03:17,719
Totally.

38
00:03:17,762 --> 00:03:19,242
I really like your helmet.

39
00:03:19,286 --> 00:03:20,112
Thanks.

40
00:03:20,156 --> 00:03:21,940
I painted it myself.

41
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,551
It's a soup pot.

42
00:03:23,594 --> 00:03:24,987
I know.

43
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,684
By the way, I'm Zhi.

44
00:03:26,728 --> 00:03:28,077
Hi, I'm--

45
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,947
Zhi-zhi.

46
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:30,645
Uh-oh, hide me, please.

47
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,995
How many times do
I have to tell you?

48
00:03:33,038 --> 00:03:34,562
Ow, ow, ow!

49
00:03:34,605 --> 00:03:36,825
You need to stop with your
foolish racing fantasies.

50
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,743
Granny Bai, Granny Bai.

51
00:03:41,786 --> 00:03:43,397
Uhm, nice meeting you.

52
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,664
I swear he's
just a stubborn as you were.

53
00:03:49,707 --> 00:03:52,667
Look at it, my best soup pot.

54
00:03:58,803 --> 00:04:00,283
I don't get it, mama.

55
00:04:00,327 --> 00:04:02,938
Everyone thinks I'm a weirdo
when I'm just being me.

56
00:04:05,593 --> 00:04:08,770
And Granny, she
doesn't get me at all.

57
00:04:08,813 --> 00:04:11,338
She just makes me
practice Tai Chi.

58
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:14,341
Tai Chi is how we
lorises slow down

59
00:04:14,384 --> 00:04:20,651
the world by allowing the breath
of life to flow through us.

60
00:04:30,182 --> 00:04:31,183
Whoa!

61
00:04:31,227 --> 00:04:33,795
And she makes me trim plants.

62
00:04:33,838 --> 00:04:35,275
The
tree just knows how

63
00:04:35,318 --> 00:04:38,016
to grow, the leaves to bloom.

64
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,018
This is their Dao.

65
00:04:40,062 --> 00:04:45,110
The question you must
answer is, what is your Dao?

66
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:50,507
But I don't care

67
00:04:50,551 --> 00:04:52,596
about that kind of stuff, mama.

68
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,728
I just want to race.

69
00:05:08,395 --> 00:05:09,961
Mama, mama!

70
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:12,094
I got a slot in tonight's race.

71
00:05:12,137 --> 00:05:15,924
And I know I can win this one.

72
00:05:15,967 --> 00:05:18,753
Oh, hey, don't tell Granny, OK?

73
00:05:18,796 --> 00:05:19,623
Who's racing?

74
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:20,494
I'm racing.

75
00:05:20,537 --> 00:05:21,625
Who's racing?

76
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:22,583
I'm racing.

77
00:05:22,626 --> 00:05:23,627
Who's racing?

78
00:05:23,671 --> 00:05:24,628
This guy.

79
00:05:24,672 --> 00:05:26,543
I am racing.

80
00:05:26,587 --> 00:05:27,109
Whoa!

81
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:32,636
And it
looks like it's

82
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,161
going to be a drag race into the
final stretch with Local Loris

83
00:05:36,205 --> 00:05:37,380
Zhi on the move.

84
00:05:39,948 --> 00:05:41,210
Zhi finds his pocket.

85
00:05:44,256 --> 00:05:46,520
And he takes the lead.

86
00:05:46,563 --> 00:05:47,434
This is it.

87
00:05:47,477 --> 00:05:48,435
I got this.

88
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:49,523
I totally got this.

89
00:05:53,483 --> 00:05:54,963
Oh!

90
00:05:58,445 --> 00:06:01,404
Ahh, ahh!

91
00:06:01,448 --> 00:06:02,927
Wah-- ahh!

92
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:09,325
Oof!

93
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,544
Ugh-- ugh.

94
00:06:13,764 --> 00:06:16,550
Urgh--

95
00:06:16,593 --> 00:06:20,075
Ooh, and with no
one to blame but himself--

96
00:06:20,989 --> 00:06:22,817
--that has got to sting.

97
00:06:30,172 --> 00:06:31,695
Hey, kid.

98
00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:33,654
Why the cloudy face?

99
00:06:33,697 --> 00:06:36,918
Oh, hey, Gnash.

100
00:06:36,961 --> 00:06:38,223
I saw you out there tonight.

101
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:39,573
You looked pretty good.

102
00:06:39,616 --> 00:06:41,096
Ha.

103
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:42,837
I think you might need to
get your glasses fixed.

104
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,058
Eh, I learned long ago to
trust my gut, not my eyes.

105
00:06:47,102 --> 00:06:47,581
Ooh.

106
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,239
Ah?

107
00:06:54,283 --> 00:06:57,329
Pretty good, right?

108
00:06:57,373 --> 00:06:59,462
OK, how about this one?

109
00:07:04,032 --> 00:07:09,037
Winners are always winning
even when they're losing.

110
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,867
Hmm, I-- I got to go.

111
00:07:44,942 --> 00:07:46,509
Do we have to do this?

112
00:07:46,553 --> 00:07:50,948
Yes, your D is blocked again.

113
00:08:03,613 --> 00:08:04,527
Hey, check it out.

114
00:08:04,571 --> 00:08:07,356
Tai Chi with a beetle--

115
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,139
Tai Chitle.

116
00:08:25,287 --> 00:08:26,549
Wow.

117
00:08:26,593 --> 00:08:28,551
Tai Chitle is not a thing.

118
00:08:31,815 --> 00:08:32,990
Off you go.

119
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:35,297
I'm begging your
pardon, Granny Bai.

120
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,125
I'm worried about you.

121
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:39,519
When will you find your Dao?

122
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:41,085
How do you know I haven't?

123
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:44,785
Because Dao is
the path to harmony.

124
00:08:44,828 --> 00:08:48,615
And this, this is
not harmonious.

125
00:08:48,658 --> 00:08:50,660
What if that's because
I have a different path?

126
00:08:50,704 --> 00:08:51,748
And this is it.

127
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:53,271
It's just a loop--

128
00:08:53,315 --> 00:08:56,927
a never-ending loop of
humiliation and rejection.

129
00:08:56,971 --> 00:08:59,147
What if this is my harmony?

130
00:08:59,190 --> 00:08:59,930
It's not.

131
00:09:03,586 --> 00:09:04,892
Whoa!

132
00:09:04,935 --> 00:09:07,938
What is going on?

133
00:09:07,982 --> 00:09:09,113
What the--

134
00:09:09,157 --> 00:09:09,723
That's it.

135
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:10,593
That's it.

136
00:09:10,637 --> 00:09:11,638
Down it goes.

137
00:09:26,522 --> 00:09:29,046
Vainglorious Industries?

138
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,179
Like Archie Vainglorious?

139
00:09:32,702 --> 00:09:34,661
ARCHIE VAINGLORIOUS : Congratulations.

140
00:09:34,704 --> 00:09:37,185
Your lovely home has
been hand-selected

141
00:09:37,228 --> 00:09:41,406
by me, Archie Vainglorious,
for total repossession

142
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,365
and extreme demolition.

143
00:09:43,408 --> 00:09:44,758
Demolition?

144
00:09:44,801 --> 00:09:46,629
ARCHIE VAINGLORIOUS : Yes, demolition.

145
00:09:46,673 --> 00:09:49,284
Echo, diabolical laugh.

146
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:54,985
ARCHIE VAINGLORIOUS : Have a nice day.

147
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:56,639
How can they do this?

148
00:09:59,337 --> 00:10:00,077
No.

149
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:01,470
Don't cry, Granny.

150
00:10:01,513 --> 00:10:03,951
This has to be some kind
of misunderstanding.

151
00:10:03,994 --> 00:10:07,737
I'm going to go and try
to sort this out somehow.

152
00:10:37,854 --> 00:10:40,683
Whoa!

153
00:10:40,727 --> 00:10:42,642
And Archie
Vainglorious has just

154
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:44,295
taken the Bonzer Rally Cup.

155
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,167
Ooh.

156
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:46,689
What the?

157
00:10:51,215 --> 00:10:55,350
Whoa, that's a big toad.

158
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,228
Huh?

159
00:11:17,241 --> 00:11:18,155
Right, who are you?

160
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:19,679
And who let you in?

161
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:21,506
Oh, hi.

162
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,682
My name's Zhi.

163
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:25,075
But usually, people call me Zhi.

164
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:27,338
I'm a-- I'm a huge fan.

165
00:11:27,382 --> 00:11:29,079
Of course, you are.

166
00:11:31,865 --> 00:11:35,825
Congratulations, you met
me, Archie Vainglorious.

167
00:11:40,264 --> 00:11:41,657
OK.

168
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:46,053
Thanks, but I actually
came for something else.

169
00:11:46,096 --> 00:11:47,881
I'm from the Slow Loris Village.

170
00:11:47,924 --> 00:11:50,622
And I want to talk
about my Granny's house.

171
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,886
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

172
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:55,802
I mean, what would a cane
toad and a legendary racer

173
00:11:55,845 --> 00:11:58,413
like you even want with
the Slow Loris Village?

174
00:11:58,456 --> 00:11:59,806
Nothing.

175
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:01,329
That's why I'm going to
plow it and flood it.

176
00:12:01,372 --> 00:12:03,461
Let me show you.

177
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:04,332
Ahh!

178
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,813
Wait, wait, wait-- ahh!

179
00:12:06,856 --> 00:12:10,251
Muddy Meadows-- luxury,
high-end swamplands

180
00:12:10,294 --> 00:12:12,079
for the posh toad set.

181
00:12:12,122 --> 00:12:13,776
Muddy Meadows?

182
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,474
It tested better
than Funky Fields.

183
00:12:16,518 --> 00:12:18,955
But it's the last Slow
Loris Village in China.

184
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:20,827
How can you even be
allowed to do this?

185
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,177
Quite easily, actually,
because who really

186
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,005
knows what a Slow Loris is?

187
00:12:25,048 --> 00:12:28,051
Hey, now, if you were
pandas, forget about it.

188
00:12:28,095 --> 00:12:29,879
But slow lorises?

189
00:12:29,923 --> 00:12:32,142
Please, who even cares?

190
00:12:32,186 --> 00:12:33,665
I do!

191
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:36,103
OK, OK, no need to get
your knickers in a twist.

192
00:12:36,146 --> 00:12:40,063
You and your Granny still
have 10 days to pay.

193
00:12:40,107 --> 00:12:41,543
10 days?

194
00:12:41,586 --> 00:12:44,067
We can't raise this
much money in 10 days.

195
00:12:44,111 --> 00:12:45,416
Well, in that case--

196
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,334
Huh?

197
00:12:50,378 --> 00:12:50,813
Hold on.

198
00:12:50,857 --> 00:12:51,553
Hold on.

199
00:12:51,596 --> 00:12:52,684
Hey, hey, wait.

200
00:12:52,728 --> 00:12:57,037
Oh, coming soon.

201
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:02,129
Ah The Silk Road Rally,
Kashgar to Shanghai.

202
00:13:02,172 --> 00:13:04,566
Oh, it's going to be epic.

203
00:13:04,609 --> 00:13:06,524
It's a little
presumptuous, isn't it?

204
00:13:06,568 --> 00:13:08,004
Building a trophy case?

205
00:13:08,048 --> 00:13:10,093
I mean, you haven't
even won yet.

206
00:13:10,137 --> 00:13:11,312
But I will.

207
00:13:11,355 --> 00:13:14,271
Let me break it down
for you, fellow.

208
00:13:14,315 --> 00:13:16,665
Daddy, grandaddy,
my imbecile brothers

209
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,058
helped me join in
on the business.

210
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:19,494
Help us bump the numbers.

211
00:13:19,537 --> 00:13:20,538
Real estate is boring.

212
00:13:20,582 --> 00:13:22,018
It's really quite a blunder.

213
00:13:22,062 --> 00:13:24,107
So they bring the coins
while I bring the thunder.

214
00:13:24,151 --> 00:13:25,326
The fastest car, I got it.

215
00:13:25,369 --> 00:13:26,936
Your village, I bought it.

216
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,982
It makes my daddy proud to
have our name in gold on it.

217
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:31,332
Rally after rally, knocking
trophies down like pins.

218
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,421
Plain and simple, loris,
Vainglorious wins.

219
00:13:38,426 --> 00:13:39,906
The album drops next year.

220
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,868
You seem pretty confident
you're going to win.

221
00:13:45,912 --> 00:13:47,565
Willing to stake a bet on it?

222
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:48,871
What do you have in mind?

223
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:50,003
If I win the cup--

224
00:13:50,046 --> 00:13:50,873
Wait!

225
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:52,309
You?

226
00:13:52,353 --> 00:13:53,920
You are the one who
is personally going

227
00:13:53,963 --> 00:13:56,313
to be doing the beating of me?

228
00:13:56,357 --> 00:13:57,793
I laugh at the idea.

229
00:14:05,148 --> 00:14:07,194
I know it's crazy.

230
00:14:07,237 --> 00:14:08,064
Sorry, little champ.

231
00:14:08,108 --> 00:14:09,587
You were saying?

232
00:14:09,631 --> 00:14:12,373
If I win, you give me
the deed to Granny's house

233
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:13,940
free and clear.

234
00:14:13,983 --> 00:14:16,681
Such hutzpah, I love it!

235
00:14:16,725 --> 00:14:18,509
I accept your bet.

236
00:14:18,553 --> 00:14:24,167
But if I win, you become
the face of Muddy Meadows.

237
00:14:24,211 --> 00:14:25,081
Me?

238
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,474
But I'm not a toad.

239
00:14:26,517 --> 00:14:31,261
No, but you are
toad-ally adorable.

240
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:35,744
See you at the starting
line, slow loris.

241
00:14:35,787 --> 00:14:36,614
Slow loris.

242
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:41,881
Super nice guy.

243
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:43,883
I look forward to
annihilating him.

244
00:14:53,066 --> 00:14:56,112
Why the long face, kid?

245
00:14:56,156 --> 00:15:04,599
I kind of have to sort of race
the Silk Road Rally and win it.

246
00:15:04,642 --> 00:15:07,080
The Silk Road Rally?

247
00:15:07,123 --> 00:15:10,779
Oh, that the race
is no holds barred.

248
00:15:10,822 --> 00:15:14,478
200 miles per hour
for four days straight

249
00:15:14,522 --> 00:15:19,179
across unforgiving terrain
against the craziest drivers

250
00:15:19,222 --> 00:15:19,962
in the world.

251
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,317
Yeah, so why would you
want to get mixed up

252
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:29,450
in the kamikaze
mission like that?

253
00:15:29,493 --> 00:15:30,973
Because it's
the only shot I've

254
00:15:31,017 --> 00:15:35,195
got as saving our house
from becoming Muddy Meadows.

255
00:15:35,238 --> 00:15:36,674
I don't follow.

256
00:15:36,718 --> 00:15:38,807
If I don't win that
cup, Vainglorious Industry

257
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,678
is going to tear down our house.

258
00:15:40,722 --> 00:15:42,419
Vainglorious?

259
00:15:42,463 --> 00:15:44,769
As in Archie Vainglorious?

260
00:15:44,813 --> 00:15:46,249
I know!

261
00:15:46,293 --> 00:15:48,512
How am I going to beat the
best racer in the world?

262
00:15:50,514 --> 00:15:53,300
I'm in way
over my head, Gnash.

263
00:15:55,824 --> 00:15:58,827
Our home is all we have.

264
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,698
It's my mom's final
resting place.

265
00:16:04,876 --> 00:16:05,877
Hmm.

266
00:16:05,921 --> 00:16:07,967
All right, kid, come with me.

267
00:16:11,622 --> 00:16:12,667
Whoa!

268
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,408
This place is awesome.

269
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,988
You were a race car driver?

270
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:31,642
I've been lots of things.

271
00:16:31,686 --> 00:16:33,644
So this is how I see it, kid.

272
00:16:33,688 --> 00:16:35,603
You are like this part.

273
00:16:35,646 --> 00:16:39,607
You got everything you need,
but it's just a tangled up mess.

274
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,435
It can't do you any good.

275
00:16:41,478 --> 00:16:45,047
But you and me together--

276
00:16:48,181 --> 00:16:50,009
--mm-- ooh.

277
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:51,575
Looking good, Gnash.

278
00:16:51,619 --> 00:16:53,882
Looking real good.

279
00:16:53,925 --> 00:16:57,407
Together, there ain't
nothing we can't do.

280
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,151
Together like me and you?

281
00:17:02,195 --> 00:17:04,980
Yeah, I've probably seen
every one of your crashes--

282
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,025
I mean, races.

283
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:07,417
You have?

284
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:08,940
You've got raw talent.

285
00:17:08,984 --> 00:17:12,379
And you've got guts, but
you're missing something.

286
00:17:12,422 --> 00:17:13,989
I can help you find it.

287
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,079
But only if you're
willing to listen.

288
00:17:17,123 --> 00:17:18,515
No questions asked.

289
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:19,821
You would do that?

290
00:17:19,864 --> 00:17:21,388
But why?

291
00:17:21,431 --> 00:17:23,085
OK, that was two questions
right off the line there.

292
00:17:23,129 --> 00:17:27,959
What part of no questions
asked did you not understand?

293
00:17:28,003 --> 00:17:31,876
Hey, the heart of a champion
beats in all of us, kid.

294
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,616
See you tomorrow.

295
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,407
That apple really didn't fall
far from the tree, did it?

296
00:17:54,421 --> 00:17:55,074
I know.

297
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:56,684
I know.

298
00:17:56,727 --> 00:18:01,732
I said I was walking away
for good, but he's your son.

299
00:18:01,776 --> 00:18:03,125
What am I supposed to do?

300
00:18:08,174 --> 00:18:09,392
Birds got to fly.

301
00:18:09,436 --> 00:18:11,090
Fishes got to swim.

302
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:15,181
And the goat-- well, a
goat has got to race.

303
00:18:24,015 --> 00:18:28,019
So Zhi-zhi, how did
it go with Vainglorious?

304
00:18:28,063 --> 00:18:30,152
Yeah, good.

305
00:18:30,196 --> 00:18:31,197
Very good.

306
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,502
Yeah, I have it under control.

307
00:18:32,546 --> 00:18:35,592
Just leave it-- leave it at me.

308
00:18:35,636 --> 00:18:38,726
I just have to go
away for a while.

309
00:18:38,769 --> 00:18:40,119
Go away?

310
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:42,164
Where?

311
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:52,043
To How to Defeat an
Evil Cane Toad TedTalk?

312
00:18:52,087 --> 00:18:53,306
I got to go.

313
00:18:53,349 --> 00:18:54,263
See you later, Granny.

314
00:18:57,484 --> 00:19:01,705
You do know that when he lies
to me, his left eye twitches.

315
00:19:01,749 --> 00:19:04,534
Exactly the same way yours did.

316
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,148
OK, kid.

317
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:11,628
Let's talk about your last race.

318
00:19:11,672 --> 00:19:16,155
It was yours to win, but then--

319
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:17,112
Ugh.

320
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,635
So what happened?

321
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:19,897
Do you see that guy's car?

322
00:19:19,941 --> 00:19:21,464
If I had a car like that--

323
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:22,987
What the?

324
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:24,424
Cars don't win races.

325
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:27,731
Drivers do.

326
00:19:27,775 --> 00:19:31,344
Although, yeah, we actually
are going to need a car.

327
00:19:31,387 --> 00:19:34,216
What?

328
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,958
Appearance is an illusion.

329
00:19:37,001 --> 00:19:38,264
It's what's inside that counts.

330
00:19:44,487 --> 00:19:46,620
Reluctantly
crouched at the starting line.

331
00:19:46,663 --> 00:19:49,318
Engines pumping and
thumping in time.

332
00:19:49,362 --> 00:19:50,667
The green light flashes.

333
00:19:50,711 --> 00:19:52,103
The flames go up.

334
00:19:52,147 --> 00:19:54,497
Churning and burning,
they yearn for the cup.

335
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:57,544
They deftly maneuver
and muscle for rank.

336
00:19:57,587 --> 00:20:00,242
Fuel burning fast
on an empty tank.

337
00:20:00,286 --> 00:20:02,636
Reckless and wild, they
pour through the turns.

338
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:05,116
Their prowess is potent
and secretly stern.

339
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,902
As they speed through the
finish, the flags go down.

340
00:20:07,945 --> 00:20:08,946
The fans get up.

341
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,600
And they get out of town.

342
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:11,645
The sun has gone down.

343
00:20:11,688 --> 00:20:12,994
And the moon has gone up.

344
00:20:13,037 --> 00:20:14,517
Ha!

345
00:20:14,561 --> 00:20:16,127
And long ago,
somebody left with the cup.

346
00:20:16,171 --> 00:20:18,129
But he's driving and striving
and hugging the turns

347
00:20:18,173 --> 00:20:19,174
and thinking of someone--

348
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,221
OK, let's see what you got.

349
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:25,180
He's
going the distance.

350
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,183
He's going for speed.

351
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,619
She's all alone.

352
00:20:29,663 --> 00:20:31,142
All alone.

353
00:20:34,189 --> 00:20:36,235
It's just like
in his last race.

354
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:40,282
The moment he takes
the lead, he chokes.

355
00:20:40,326 --> 00:20:44,330
The key to winning is focusing
on the road ahead of you.

356
00:20:50,336 --> 00:20:51,424
Also, not crashing
into walls is good.

357
00:20:58,605 --> 00:21:01,260
He always gets nervous
when he's ahead.

358
00:21:04,654 --> 00:21:06,134
Oh, oh, oh.

359
00:21:06,177 --> 00:21:06,656
Whoa!

360
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,446
Maybe if I hold him back--

361
00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:14,098
that's it!

362
00:21:18,364 --> 00:21:18,842
Not yet.

363
00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:23,586
Not yet.

364
00:21:26,894 --> 00:21:27,373
Now.

365
00:21:33,553 --> 00:21:35,424
That was awesome!

366
00:21:40,037 --> 00:21:41,430
Ha, ha, ha!

367
00:21:41,474 --> 00:21:42,388
Go, Gnash.

368
00:21:42,431 --> 00:21:43,998
Yeah.

369
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:44,912
Yeah, I like it.

370
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:48,132
Pathetic.

371
00:21:50,831 --> 00:21:51,310
Moronic.

372
00:21:54,138 --> 00:21:56,271
Beyond ridiculous.

373
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,752
Oh, this is too easy.

374
00:21:58,795 --> 00:22:00,014
Seahorses?

375
00:22:00,057 --> 00:22:02,538
Seriously?

376
00:22:02,582 --> 00:22:03,931
Hold the line.

377
00:22:03,974 --> 00:22:06,063
Who's this?

378
00:22:06,107 --> 00:22:08,327
The Amazing Gnash?

379
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:09,937
Right.

380
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,896
Well, you're not nearly as
dead as I thought you were.

381
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,208
Hmm, this is quite the wrinkle.

382
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:25,735
If you're in the
race, I could lose.

383
00:22:28,695 --> 00:22:29,609
It's V.

384
00:22:29,652 --> 00:22:30,958
What do you want?

385
00:22:31,001 --> 00:22:34,396
I'm ready for you to
repay me that favor.

386
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:39,532
Neil will be in touch
with further instructions.

387
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:19,789
Welcome race
fans to the Silk Road Rally.

388
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:21,356
I am Abby Jacks.

389
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,315
And with me, at the repeated
request of my husband,

390
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:28,407
is my sister-in-law,
Juni Hakansdotter.

391
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,583
Hey, that's me.

392
00:23:39,026 --> 00:23:44,335
And hailing from
India, India's team, Tandem.

393
00:23:44,379 --> 00:23:46,860
I wonder how they
put their pants on.

394
00:23:46,903 --> 00:23:50,951
And there they are,
the British Invasion.

395
00:23:50,994 --> 00:23:54,563
And straight out of South
Central, China, Bling

396
00:23:54,607 --> 00:23:55,346
and Bling.

397
00:23:58,785 --> 00:24:00,221
Good
morning race fans

398
00:24:00,264 --> 00:24:04,312
and welcome to the main event.

399
00:24:04,355 --> 00:24:05,661
Ha-ha!

400
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,709
Who
let the frog out?

401
00:24:09,752 --> 00:24:12,668
I got him.

402
00:24:12,712 --> 00:24:15,062
Who let the frog out?

403
00:24:15,105 --> 00:24:16,629
Who
let the frog out?

404
00:24:16,672 --> 00:24:17,847
And,
of course, no race

405
00:24:17,891 --> 00:24:19,501
would be complete
without an entry

406
00:24:19,545 --> 00:24:22,983
from Britain's notorious,
Team Vainglorious.

407
00:24:23,026 --> 00:24:25,725
Oh, he looks slimy.

408
00:24:25,768 --> 00:24:26,639
Come on, kid.

409
00:24:26,682 --> 00:24:29,903
Let's get out of here.

410
00:24:29,946 --> 00:24:30,904
Hey.

411
00:24:32,775 --> 00:24:35,082
I'm just so excited.

412
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:37,084
By Vainglorious?

413
00:24:37,127 --> 00:24:38,825
No, by this.

414
00:24:38,868 --> 00:24:41,828
I'm due in less than two weeks.

415
00:24:41,871 --> 00:24:42,655
Wait.

416
00:24:42,698 --> 00:24:43,525
What?

417
00:24:43,569 --> 00:24:45,484
I'm pregnant.

418
00:24:45,527 --> 00:24:46,833
Oh, men.

419
00:24:46,876 --> 00:24:48,704
We are such a miracles, eh?

420
00:24:48,748 --> 00:24:51,490
Oh, I'm Berpe,
Team Wet Lightning.

421
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:53,753
Oh, hi, nice to meet you.

422
00:24:53,796 --> 00:24:55,406
I'm Zhi.

423
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,757
Berpe, would you get your
sweet little tail over here?

424
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,802
Race is about to start.

425
00:24:59,846 --> 00:25:01,412
That's my Adalina.

426
00:25:01,456 --> 00:25:03,763
Well, Zhi, good luck out there.

427
00:25:09,943 --> 00:25:12,467
Long before the
internet connected the world,

428
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,861
there was the
legendary Silk Road.

429
00:25:14,904 --> 00:25:16,906
A road that's made of silk?

430
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,778
I can't believe this.

431
00:25:18,821 --> 00:25:20,214
No, it's not made of--

432
00:25:20,257 --> 00:25:21,781
forget it.

433
00:25:21,824 --> 00:25:24,697
The course is a 4,000 clickhorse
straight across China.

434
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:28,265
The race will take place in
four legs over four days.

435
00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:31,878
And the racer with the shortest
overall time takes the cup.

436
00:25:31,921 --> 00:25:34,184
Other than that,
there are no rules.

437
00:26:02,343 --> 00:26:04,563
And as the racers
wait at the line,

438
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:06,565
they're all thinking
the same thing.

439
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:07,914
Did I remember

440
00:26:07,957 --> 00:26:09,829
to put on my
fireproof underpants?

441
00:26:09,872 --> 00:26:12,614
No, just
for one brief moment,

442
00:26:12,658 --> 00:26:14,703
it's still anyone's cup.

443
00:26:25,409 --> 00:26:27,629
Remember Vainglorious
drives dirty.

444
00:26:27,673 --> 00:26:29,805
And he doesn't waste any time.

445
00:26:29,849 --> 00:26:30,763
Trust me.

446
00:26:31,851 --> 00:26:32,373
Are you ready, Steve?

447
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:32,895
Uh-huh.

448
00:26:32,939 --> 00:26:33,853
Andy?

449
00:26:33,896 --> 00:26:34,854
Yeah.

450
00:26:34,897 --> 00:26:35,811
Mick?

451
00:26:35,855 --> 00:26:37,291
OK.

452
00:26:37,334 --> 00:26:39,206
All right, fellas.

453
00:26:39,249 --> 00:26:39,728
Let's go.

454
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:47,301
Vainglorious
wastes no time

455
00:26:47,344 --> 00:26:48,389
trying to clear the field.

456
00:26:48,432 --> 00:26:48,868
Look out!

457
00:26:48,911 --> 00:26:49,390
Ah!

458
00:27:00,749 --> 00:27:01,881
You weren't kidding.

459
00:27:01,924 --> 00:27:03,447
That toad is crazy.

460
00:27:03,491 --> 00:27:06,450
You said you wanted to
race the Silk Road Rally.

461
00:27:06,494 --> 00:27:09,671
Welcome to it.

462
00:27:09,715 --> 00:27:11,673
And the racers
begin to make their way

463
00:27:11,717 --> 00:27:14,458
across the Taklamakan Desert.

464
00:27:14,502 --> 00:27:16,199
You're supposed to
be out of the race.

465
00:27:16,243 --> 00:27:17,287
Supposed to be.

466
00:27:20,769 --> 00:27:21,422
Ah!

467
00:27:21,465 --> 00:27:22,075
Get it off!

468
00:27:22,118 --> 00:27:22,771
Get it off!

469
00:27:22,815 --> 00:27:24,468
Ah, new idea.

470
00:27:24,512 --> 00:27:25,469
Echoes, attack.

471
00:27:28,777 --> 00:27:30,257
Haha!

472
00:27:33,739 --> 00:27:35,218
Gah!

473
00:27:38,613 --> 00:27:40,223
Ballroom
blitz, ballroom blitz.

474
00:27:40,267 --> 00:27:42,704
Ballroom blitz.

475
00:27:42,748 --> 00:27:45,185
Ballroom blitz.

476
00:27:45,228 --> 00:27:47,187
Ballroom blitz.

477
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:50,103
And here comes
Argentina's Team Kale

478
00:27:50,146 --> 00:27:53,062
driving a car with no
steering wheel at all.

479
00:27:56,022 --> 00:27:56,544
Ah!

480
00:28:08,948 --> 00:28:10,950
Holy
molly, newbie team

481
00:28:10,993 --> 00:28:14,257
Muddy Meadows just took
the lead from Vainglorious.

482
00:28:14,301 --> 00:28:16,433
Enjoy the moment, loris.

483
00:28:16,477 --> 00:28:19,219
It will not last.

484
00:28:19,262 --> 00:28:20,263
Diabolical laugh.

485
00:28:24,006 --> 00:28:24,659
Oh, yeah!

486
00:28:28,576 --> 00:28:31,013
I can't get him off my tail.

487
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:35,844
All right, kid.

488
00:28:35,888 --> 00:28:37,585
It's all about focus now.

489
00:28:37,628 --> 00:28:39,152
Enter the zone.

490
00:28:39,195 --> 00:28:40,240
No distraction.

491
00:28:40,283 --> 00:28:41,415
OK, I get it.

492
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:43,025
Hey, is that a loris?

493
00:28:43,069 --> 00:28:44,897
I'm pretty sure it's
a loris right there.

494
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,767
Gee, focus.

495
00:28:45,811 --> 00:28:46,289
Whoa!

496
00:28:49,815 --> 00:28:50,772
Whoa!

497
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,512
You're right.

498
00:28:51,555 --> 00:28:52,382
That is a loris.

499
00:28:52,426 --> 00:28:53,166
We should stop.

500
00:28:53,209 --> 00:28:54,167
What?

501
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:55,690
I was to say we just-- stop!

502
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,648
Ta-ta, loser!

503
00:28:57,692 --> 00:28:58,780
Unbelievable!

504
00:28:58,824 --> 00:29:02,349
The lead car just
chucked to U-ey.

505
00:29:02,392 --> 00:29:03,872
What are you doing?

506
00:29:03,916 --> 00:29:05,178
No questions asked.

507
00:29:05,221 --> 00:29:06,483
You agreed.

508
00:29:06,527 --> 00:29:08,094
Gnash!

509
00:29:08,137 --> 00:29:09,486
Oh, come on, Gnash.

510
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:10,444
Get back here.

511
00:29:11,488 --> 00:29:12,881
Huh--

512
00:29:14,665 --> 00:29:15,362
Hmm?

513
00:29:15,405 --> 00:29:16,406
What--

514
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,668
Hey, Neil.

515
00:29:17,712 --> 00:29:19,279
It's been a long time.

516
00:29:19,322 --> 00:29:23,152
Well, if it isn't
the Average Gnash.

517
00:29:23,196 --> 00:29:24,675
Seriously?

518
00:29:24,719 --> 00:29:26,199
15 years, that's the best
you could come up with?

519
00:29:34,555 --> 00:29:35,774
Hey, you OK over here?

520
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:38,037
Yeah, I'm fine.

521
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,255
Whoa!

522
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:43,999
Wow, this is heavier
than it looks.

523
00:29:44,043 --> 00:29:46,567
Whoa, you're a loris.

524
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:47,089
Uh.

525
00:29:54,531 --> 00:29:59,362
So you got a name or--

526
00:29:59,406 --> 00:30:01,321
Uh.

527
00:30:01,364 --> 00:30:04,193
What if I just
call you Speedy?

528
00:30:04,237 --> 00:30:06,979
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

529
00:30:07,022 --> 00:30:08,284
Uh, uh-huh.

530
00:30:08,328 --> 00:30:10,634
A racer and a great
conversationalist--

531
00:30:10,678 --> 00:30:11,592
my lucky day.

532
00:30:14,334 --> 00:30:15,988
Gnash, you all right?

533
00:30:16,031 --> 00:30:17,250
Never better.

534
00:30:17,293 --> 00:30:18,338
Hey, you dropped this.

535
00:30:18,381 --> 00:30:20,427
Huh?

536
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:22,255
Well, that was fun.

537
00:30:22,298 --> 00:30:23,691
I don't think that
tiger is going

538
00:30:23,734 --> 00:30:25,388
to give you any more grief.

539
00:30:25,432 --> 00:30:27,216
You'd be surprised.

540
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,739
Thanks for stopping guys.

541
00:30:28,783 --> 00:30:31,830
And maybe I'll see you
around sometimes, Speedy.

542
00:30:31,873 --> 00:30:32,961
Uh.

543
00:30:33,005 --> 00:30:34,136
Aw.

544
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,094
Sorry to break
up the fun, kids.

545
00:30:35,137 --> 00:30:36,356
Gnash, don't--

546
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,010
But we have to get
back to our race.

547
00:30:38,053 --> 00:30:39,141
Bye.

548
00:30:39,185 --> 00:30:42,623
Nice meeting you.

549
00:30:42,666 --> 00:30:46,279
Penny for your
thoughts, Speedy?

550
00:30:46,322 --> 00:30:47,236
Huh?

551
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,890
Oh, it's nothing.

552
00:30:48,934 --> 00:30:49,412
All good.

553
00:31:00,946 --> 00:31:03,339
Oh, there you are, Shelby.

554
00:31:03,383 --> 00:31:04,950
I'm dying to hear.

555
00:31:04,993 --> 00:31:06,516
Give me the deets.

556
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,171
Why didn't you tell me
that your mark was a loris?

557
00:31:09,215 --> 00:31:11,130
What a scintillating question.

558
00:31:11,173 --> 00:31:12,958
Let me have a think on that.

559
00:31:13,001 --> 00:31:14,437
I don't know.

560
00:31:14,481 --> 00:31:17,658
Maybe because, uh,
you work for me!

561
00:31:17,701 --> 00:31:18,964
So what happened?

562
00:31:19,007 --> 00:31:20,487
Let's just say
your pet kitty is

563
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:22,706
going to have quite the
headache when he wakes up.

564
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,012
Sorry, I don't follow.

565
00:31:24,056 --> 00:31:26,362
Your tiger couldn't
handle the goat.

566
00:31:33,979 --> 00:31:36,546
Vainglorious will be
the first to throw his name up

567
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,939
on the leaderboard.

568
00:31:37,983 --> 00:31:39,767
But with three more
days of racing ahead,

569
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:41,943
this race is far from over.

570
00:31:41,987 --> 00:31:45,033
Wait, so
this race is actually four days.

571
00:31:45,077 --> 00:31:46,992
You cost us the race.

572
00:31:47,035 --> 00:31:49,733
Races aren't won or lost
until the final second.

573
00:31:54,042 --> 00:31:55,130
We were ahead.

574
00:31:55,174 --> 00:31:56,523
Why would you make a stop?

575
00:32:05,445 --> 00:32:09,840
Feel with
your gut, not with your eyes.

576
00:32:09,884 --> 00:32:11,799
That's not what I sound like.

577
00:32:11,842 --> 00:32:14,193
Let's
do a whole training montage.

578
00:32:14,236 --> 00:32:17,544
But then, let's make it
totally irrelevant by stopping

579
00:32:17,587 --> 00:32:19,111
and blowing our time.

580
00:32:19,154 --> 00:32:21,374
I don't know
where this kid has come from,

581
00:32:21,417 --> 00:32:23,332
but he's clearly come to win.

582
00:32:23,376 --> 00:32:24,986
Oh, I know this one.

583
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:27,206
He came from China.

584
00:32:27,249 --> 00:32:27,858
Oh, Madonna.

585
00:32:32,994 --> 00:32:36,215
Sixth place--
super impressive--

586
00:32:36,258 --> 00:32:38,173
on opposite day.

587
00:32:38,217 --> 00:32:39,479
Sixth place?

588
00:32:39,522 --> 00:32:40,871
You did great, kid.

589
00:32:40,915 --> 00:32:42,525
I was in the lead.

590
00:32:42,569 --> 00:32:44,614
Which is when
you always lose it.

591
00:32:44,658 --> 00:32:48,531
But when you're behind, kid,
you're a force of nature.

592
00:32:53,188 --> 00:32:55,712
Zhi, how could
you not have told me

593
00:32:55,756 --> 00:32:57,236
that you are such a driver?

594
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,585
Fantastico!

595
00:32:58,628 --> 00:33:00,326
Fantastico?

596
00:33:00,369 --> 00:33:02,284
Anyone else would
have come in last

597
00:33:02,328 --> 00:33:04,460
after stopping
like you did today.

598
00:33:04,504 --> 00:33:08,899
But then, oh,
watching you drive,

599
00:33:08,943 --> 00:33:11,598
it's like a poetry in motion.

600
00:33:15,384 --> 00:33:17,082
I need a snack.

601
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:19,562
I don't know, maybe a pint of
ice cream and some seaweed pad

602
00:33:19,606 --> 00:33:20,085
thai.

603
00:33:40,757 --> 00:33:43,499
I know why he's
doing it, but I'm still

604
00:33:43,543 --> 00:33:46,937
terrified every time he
walks out of that gate.

605
00:33:50,811 --> 00:33:52,987
Watch over him up there, OK?

606
00:33:57,861 --> 00:33:59,298
For both of us.

607
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:03,824
Who could that be at this hour?

608
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:14,748
Oh my dears, come in, come in.

609
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:15,575
Oh, thank you.

610
00:34:33,027 --> 00:34:35,464
What the?

611
00:34:35,508 --> 00:34:37,336
That was seriously me?

612
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:38,641
How did I--

613
00:34:38,685 --> 00:34:39,947
Not a big
fan of parties, huh?

614
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:41,644
Who said that?

615
00:34:41,688 --> 00:34:42,384
Hey!

616
00:34:42,428 --> 00:34:43,864
You, wait up.

617
00:34:43,907 --> 00:34:46,345
Hey, where did you go?

618
00:34:46,388 --> 00:34:48,738
Oh, hey.

619
00:34:48,782 --> 00:34:50,000
Hey, hi.

620
00:34:50,044 --> 00:34:53,221
It's-- it's you.

621
00:34:53,265 --> 00:34:56,268
Oh, I see you've been working
on your conversation skills.

622
00:34:56,311 --> 00:34:58,139
Ha!

623
00:34:58,183 --> 00:35:03,013
my conversation skills, because
that's what you said last time.

624
00:35:03,057 --> 00:35:05,364
So sixth place, huh, Speedy?

625
00:35:05,407 --> 00:35:06,800
It could be worse.

626
00:35:06,843 --> 00:35:08,149
Hmm.

627
00:35:08,193 --> 00:35:09,890
Oh, I get it.

628
00:35:09,933 --> 00:35:11,631
You're one of those
all-or-nothing racers.

629
00:35:11,674 --> 00:35:13,676
And it's just all
about the trophy.

630
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,591
I wouldn't say that exactly.

631
00:35:15,635 --> 00:35:18,246
OK, so you're more of
the fame and glory type.

632
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:21,293
I don't think
that's it either.

633
00:35:21,336 --> 00:35:22,903
Then what are you?

634
00:35:22,946 --> 00:35:25,210
Well, I'm really only
here for my Granny.

635
00:35:25,253 --> 00:35:29,257
I'm trying to save our home
from this psychotic toad.

636
00:35:29,301 --> 00:35:30,693
Save your home?

637
00:35:30,737 --> 00:35:31,564
Yeah.

638
00:35:31,607 --> 00:35:33,174
And not just my home.

639
00:35:33,218 --> 00:35:35,394
He's actually planning on
destroying the entire loris

640
00:35:35,437 --> 00:35:36,351
village.

641
00:35:36,395 --> 00:35:37,831
The entire loris village?

642
00:35:37,874 --> 00:35:39,137
Yeah.

643
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,138
And it's going to
kill my Granny Bai.

644
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:41,574
I just know it.

645
00:35:41,617 --> 00:35:43,097
Granny Bai?

646
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,054
Granny Bai!

647
00:35:44,098 --> 00:35:44,751
Wait!

648
00:35:44,794 --> 00:35:46,187
You're that Zhi?

649
00:35:46,231 --> 00:35:47,536
I don't know.

650
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:50,235
I guess it depends which
Zhi you think I am.

651
00:35:50,278 --> 00:35:52,585
From the park at the
Loris Day Festival.

652
00:35:52,628 --> 00:35:56,632
When we were kids, you were
wearing a painted soup pot

653
00:35:56,676 --> 00:35:57,633
on your head.

654
00:35:57,677 --> 00:35:59,069
That was you?

655
00:35:59,113 --> 00:36:03,117
I looked for you a lot,
but I couldn't find you.

656
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,901
I never even knew your name.

657
00:36:04,945 --> 00:36:06,599
I still don't know your name.

658
00:36:06,642 --> 00:36:07,991
It's Shelby.

659
00:36:08,035 --> 00:36:10,037
Shelby.

660
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,865
Why didn't I ever see you again?

661
00:36:11,908 --> 00:36:15,956
We moved to the
city for my dad's job.

662
00:36:15,999 --> 00:36:20,047
My last happy memories are
actually in that village.

663
00:36:23,485 --> 00:36:25,661
What?

664
00:36:25,705 --> 00:36:29,796
I just can't believe it's
really you after all this time.

665
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,101
I know.

666
00:36:31,145 --> 00:36:34,061
This is-- this is crazy.

667
00:36:34,104 --> 00:36:35,018
What are the chances?

668
00:36:40,981 --> 00:36:43,331
No, go back.

669
00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:48,249
Uh-- uh, what do you
say we take a walk, Speedy?

670
00:36:48,293 --> 00:36:49,337
What's going on?

671
00:36:49,381 --> 00:36:50,382
Nothing.

672
00:36:50,425 --> 00:36:52,384
I just need to stretch my quads.

673
00:36:52,427 --> 00:36:53,820
Stretch your quads?

674
00:36:59,434 --> 00:37:01,044
I bet he's over you.

675
00:37:01,088 --> 00:37:02,568
I don't think he knows others.

676
00:37:18,366 --> 00:37:21,282
Time for round 2.

677
00:37:23,806 --> 00:37:24,894
Here, kitty, kitty.

678
00:37:33,642 --> 00:37:35,644
Not smart.

679
00:37:38,168 --> 00:37:40,083
Mm-mm-mm.

680
00:37:44,044 --> 00:37:45,306
And welcome, folks.

681
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:47,395
It's fight night at
the Happy Pagoda.

682
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:48,918
Oh, I'm love a theme party.

683
00:37:58,014 --> 00:37:59,189
So tell me something.

684
00:37:59,233 --> 00:38:00,669
What happened to old Bing?

685
00:38:00,713 --> 00:38:02,671
Did she ever actually
start bottling and selling

686
00:38:02,715 --> 00:38:03,498
her own tea?

687
00:38:03,542 --> 00:38:04,891
No.

688
00:38:04,934 --> 00:38:06,153
But she's still claiming
that when she does,

689
00:38:06,196 --> 00:38:07,197
she's going to be--

690
00:38:07,241 --> 00:38:08,764
Steeped in tea money.

691
00:38:10,418 --> 00:38:11,898
Oh, what about
the Chu triplets?

692
00:38:11,941 --> 00:38:13,073
Are they still there?

693
00:38:13,116 --> 00:38:14,379
Yeah, they're
all still there--

694
00:38:14,422 --> 00:38:15,728
I think.

695
00:38:15,771 --> 00:38:17,251
I'm not really sure, actually.

696
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,687
It's kind of hard to tell.

697
00:38:26,782 --> 00:38:29,698
Hey, you think
you want to maybe--

698
00:38:29,742 --> 00:38:31,483
I don't know.

699
00:38:31,526 --> 00:38:35,008
Are you asking me
to dance, Speedy?

700
00:38:35,051 --> 00:38:36,096
I mean I--

701
00:38:41,406 --> 00:38:44,104
Aw.

702
00:38:44,147 --> 00:38:46,846
The number you have dialed
is no longer in service.

703
00:38:46,889 --> 00:38:48,761
Please check the
number and try again.

704
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,026
Gnash is in there.

705
00:38:53,069 --> 00:38:54,114
Oh, OK.

706
00:38:54,157 --> 00:38:54,636
Bye.

707
00:38:59,293 --> 00:39:01,077
Whoa, that the--

708
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:02,383
Gnash, hold on!

709
00:39:02,427 --> 00:39:03,123
I'm coming.

710
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,740
Oh, snack time.

711
00:39:11,784 --> 00:39:13,220
Whoa.

712
00:39:13,263 --> 00:39:13,916
Ahh--

713
00:39:15,744 --> 00:39:16,919
Oh, boy.

714
00:39:22,838 --> 00:39:23,796
What is going on?

715
00:39:27,103 --> 00:39:27,974
This is weird.

716
00:39:30,672 --> 00:39:32,065
Wait a minute.

717
00:39:32,108 --> 00:39:33,632
Is this what Granny was
always talking about?

718
00:39:41,248 --> 00:39:42,597
Holy golly.

719
00:39:42,641 --> 00:39:44,033
Did you see that?

720
00:39:44,077 --> 00:39:47,080
I did not.

721
00:39:47,123 --> 00:39:48,777
Oh, this is interesting.

722
00:40:01,486 --> 00:40:02,225
Excuse me.

723
00:40:06,099 --> 00:40:07,056
Thank you.

724
00:40:21,244 --> 00:40:23,638
Not bad, Speedy.

725
00:40:23,682 --> 00:40:24,857
Not bad at all.

726
00:40:31,994 --> 00:40:33,561
Well, good day, race fans.

727
00:40:33,605 --> 00:40:35,084
It's Abby Jacks.

728
00:40:35,128 --> 00:40:37,435
And welcome back to day
2 of the Silk Road Rally.

729
00:40:45,355 --> 00:40:47,749
Oh, not necessary at all.

730
00:40:47,793 --> 00:40:51,100
Well, obviously,
absolutely necessary.

731
00:40:51,144 --> 00:40:54,060
They're not the
cheering for you.

732
00:40:54,103 --> 00:40:56,062
Of course, they
are, horse of the sea

733
00:40:56,105 --> 00:40:58,368
who is hardly a horse at all.

734
00:40:58,412 --> 00:41:00,153
I don't think so.

735
00:41:00,196 --> 00:41:03,199
They are cheering
for my best friend.

736
00:41:03,243 --> 00:41:08,074
Videos of Zhi saving me and
by bambinos have gone viral.

737
00:41:08,117 --> 00:41:09,554
Viral?

738
00:41:09,597 --> 00:41:12,513
He doesn't even have a
social media coordinator.

739
00:41:18,911 --> 00:41:19,868
Zhi!

740
00:41:19,912 --> 00:41:20,390
Zhi!

741
00:41:20,434 --> 00:41:21,348
Zhi!

742
00:41:21,391 --> 00:41:24,090
I think you got some fans.

743
00:41:27,006 --> 00:41:27,485
Zhi!

744
00:41:27,528 --> 00:41:27,963
Zhi!

745
00:41:28,007 --> 00:41:28,486
Zhi!

746
00:41:28,529 --> 00:41:28,964
Zhi!

747
00:41:29,008 --> 00:41:31,924
Zhi!

748
00:41:31,967 --> 00:41:33,969
Hey, slow loris.

749
00:41:34,013 --> 00:41:36,232
Emphasis on the slow.

750
00:41:36,276 --> 00:41:39,888
Care to engage in a classic
raising of the stakes?

751
00:41:39,932 --> 00:41:41,281
What do you have in mind?

752
00:41:41,324 --> 00:41:43,675
If you win, not
only will I give you

753
00:41:43,718 --> 00:41:45,415
the deed to your
house, I'll give you

754
00:41:45,459 --> 00:41:48,723
the deed to the
whole loris village.

755
00:41:48,767 --> 00:41:50,029
What's the catch?

756
00:41:50,072 --> 00:41:55,077
If you lose, you
become my echo.

757
00:41:55,121 --> 00:41:55,600
Hmm?

758
00:42:01,606 --> 00:42:02,084
Deal.

759
00:42:05,871 --> 00:42:06,698
Aw!

760
00:42:06,741 --> 00:42:08,613
Hand buzzer-- classic.

761
00:42:27,936 --> 00:42:28,415
Zhi!

762
00:42:28,458 --> 00:42:28,894
Zhi!

763
00:42:28,937 --> 00:42:29,372
Zhi!

764
00:42:29,416 --> 00:42:29,895
Zhi!

765
00:42:39,861 --> 00:42:40,819
Hmm?

766
00:42:48,043 --> 00:42:49,262
What?

767
00:43:17,638 --> 00:43:20,206
We're talking away.

768
00:43:20,249 --> 00:43:22,774
I don't know what I'm to say.

769
00:43:22,817 --> 00:43:25,298
I'll say it anyway.

770
00:43:25,341 --> 00:43:31,783
Today is another day to
find you shying away.

771
00:43:31,826 --> 00:43:34,742
Oh, I'll be coming
for your love, OK?

772
00:43:34,786 --> 00:43:38,267
Take on me.

773
00:43:38,311 --> 00:43:39,747
Take on me.

774
00:43:39,791 --> 00:43:44,230
Take me on.

775
00:43:44,273 --> 00:43:46,232
Take on me.

776
00:43:46,275 --> 00:43:52,717
I'll be gone in a day or two.

777
00:43:56,242 --> 00:43:58,679
Take on me.

778
00:43:58,723 --> 00:44:01,160
Take me on.

779
00:44:01,203 --> 00:44:03,162
Take on me.

780
00:44:03,205 --> 00:44:05,643
I'll be gone.

781
00:44:12,171 --> 00:44:14,260
See that tree?

782
00:44:14,303 --> 00:44:15,304
Aim for that.

783
00:44:15,348 --> 00:44:16,262
Aim for--

784
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,617
Nice work.

785
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,705
Nice work.

786
00:44:24,749 --> 00:44:26,707
I was talking to the tree.

787
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:30,276
Congrats, you're no
longer on my list.

788
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:31,843
You, you're fired.

789
00:44:31,886 --> 00:44:33,235
You're fired.

790
00:44:33,279 --> 00:44:36,586
Take on me.

791
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:37,892
Take on me.

792
00:44:37,936 --> 00:44:41,069
Take me on.

793
00:44:41,113 --> 00:44:42,505
Take me on.

794
00:44:42,549 --> 00:44:44,159
Well, that was weird.

795
00:44:44,203 --> 00:44:45,726
Well,
you're not wrong.

796
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:47,946
Unless Zhi has a rope and
a trunkfull of tiny toads,

797
00:44:47,989 --> 00:44:51,253
he might be in some
serious trouble.

798
00:44:51,297 --> 00:44:51,776
Aha!

799
00:44:58,130 --> 00:44:58,652
Hmm?

800
00:45:14,973 --> 00:45:15,756
All right.

801
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,452
We did it, Gnash.

802
00:45:16,496 --> 00:45:17,236
Way to go, kid.

803
00:45:17,279 --> 00:45:18,411
That was awesome.

804
00:45:21,806 --> 00:45:23,329
There you go, little fella.

805
00:45:23,372 --> 00:45:26,462
Little fella?

806
00:45:26,506 --> 00:45:27,420
Come on, Gnash.

807
00:45:27,463 --> 00:45:29,465
We can still take the leg.

808
00:45:29,509 --> 00:45:30,379
Hey!

809
00:45:30,423 --> 00:45:30,902
Mama mia.

810
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:37,691
Back up gently, gently.

811
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,309
Oh, wait.

812
00:45:59,669 --> 00:46:01,062
My bambini!

813
00:46:01,106 --> 00:46:01,628
Zhi.

814
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:18,601
I gotcha.

815
00:46:25,608 --> 00:46:27,567
Oh, no.

816
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:29,308
My bambinos!

817
00:46:29,351 --> 00:46:30,526
Berpe!

818
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:32,659
Gnash, don't
disconnect that hitch.

819
00:46:32,702 --> 00:46:35,227
We're going to lose
a ton of time, kid.

820
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:36,750
I know.

821
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,492
But I entered a Silk Road
Rally to save a family.

822
00:46:39,535 --> 00:46:41,799
And that's exactly
what I'm going to do.

823
00:46:44,453 --> 00:46:45,715
Let's just make it quick, OK?

824
00:46:53,071 --> 00:46:54,942
Do you think this will work?

825
00:46:54,986 --> 00:46:57,466
Not a chance.

826
00:46:57,510 --> 00:46:58,816
I've got you.

827
00:46:58,859 --> 00:46:59,773
Punch it, kid.

828
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:00,818
Punch it, kid.

829
00:47:07,085 --> 00:47:09,043
Oh, this is
not looking good, folks.

830
00:47:09,087 --> 00:47:12,960
The weight and pressure are
going to rip Zhi's car in two.

831
00:47:13,004 --> 00:47:15,571
Oh,
he'd love two cars.

832
00:47:15,615 --> 00:47:16,442
Come on.

833
00:47:16,485 --> 00:47:17,443
Don't give out on me.

834
00:47:22,883 --> 00:47:24,798
Come on.

835
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:25,886
Come on!

836
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:26,800
Oh, no!

837
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,628
Hurry!

838
00:47:28,671 --> 00:47:30,978
Ah, Zhi did it!

839
00:47:31,022 --> 00:47:31,805
We're safe.

840
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,863
It was super scary, guys.

841
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:54,219
Ooh, yes!

842
00:47:54,262 --> 00:47:55,611
Berpe, Adalina!

843
00:47:55,655 --> 00:47:57,657
I'm so glad you guys are safe.

844
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:00,703
Thank you so much for saving

845
00:48:00,747 --> 00:48:03,097
my babies and my Berpe.

846
00:48:03,141 --> 00:48:05,186
I don't know what
I'd do without him.

847
00:48:08,929 --> 00:48:11,323
Well, this is truly
a remarkable moment, folks.

848
00:48:11,366 --> 00:48:13,455
And one that I don't think
we'll forget in a hurry.

849
00:48:13,499 --> 00:48:15,109
The moment went on unlikely.

850
00:48:15,153 --> 00:48:19,026
Little loris named Zhi became
the face of this Silk Road

851
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:19,592
Rally.

852
00:48:22,682 --> 00:48:23,683
Look, Granny Bai, look!

853
00:48:23,726 --> 00:48:24,771
It's Zhi!

854
00:48:24,814 --> 00:48:27,121
He saved all the other racers.

855
00:48:27,165 --> 00:48:30,559
New
face on the Silk Road Rally.

856
00:48:30,603 --> 00:48:34,215
My goodness, look at
what your boy has done.

857
00:48:34,259 --> 00:48:36,391
You must be so proud.

858
00:48:36,435 --> 00:48:37,262
Oh, I am.

859
00:48:40,004 --> 00:48:44,878
But I'm also so
ashamed of myself.

860
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:51,276
I wasn't ever really helping
him find his Dao, was I?

861
00:48:51,319 --> 00:48:55,019
I was just trying to
force him to accept mine.

862
00:48:58,631 --> 00:49:00,676
So, folks, we
are at the end of day 2.

863
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:04,202
And what a spectacular
day of racing it has been.

864
00:49:04,245 --> 00:49:06,682
Team Vainglorious nabbed
first place again.

865
00:49:06,726 --> 00:49:08,162
No big surprise there.

866
00:49:08,206 --> 00:49:10,556
But the big story of the
day is Team Muddy Meadows

867
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:13,689
who has shocked the world
by climbing into third place

868
00:49:13,733 --> 00:49:15,430
after a harrowing rescue.

869
00:49:15,474 --> 00:49:21,001
We are here with fan favorite
and hero of the day, Zhi.

870
00:49:21,045 --> 00:49:23,525
So she we would be
remiss if we didn't

871
00:49:23,569 --> 00:49:26,441
ask you the question that
is on everyone's mind.

872
00:49:26,485 --> 00:49:28,922
If you hit yourself
and it hurts,

873
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:31,403
does that mean you're
strong or weak?

874
00:49:31,446 --> 00:49:32,665
No.

875
00:49:32,708 --> 00:49:34,319
What were you thinking
when you stopped

876
00:49:34,362 --> 00:49:35,973
in the middle of the race to
rescue all your competitors?

877
00:49:36,016 --> 00:49:37,322
What was going
through your mind?

878
00:49:37,365 --> 00:49:38,149
Talk us through it.

879
00:49:38,192 --> 00:49:39,019
Honestly?

880
00:49:39,063 --> 00:49:40,151
I wasn't thinking.

881
00:49:40,194 --> 00:49:42,022
My friends were in danger.

882
00:49:42,066 --> 00:49:44,285
Besides, I still
have two more days.

883
00:49:44,329 --> 00:49:45,591
Like seriously?

884
00:49:45,634 --> 00:49:47,332
Two more?

885
00:49:47,375 --> 00:49:49,769
Well, Zhi, you definitely came
off looking like a real winner

886
00:49:49,812 --> 00:49:50,596
today.

887
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:52,337
Thanks.

888
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:55,949
It's like an old friend told me,
winners are always winning even

889
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:56,819
when they're losing.

890
00:50:11,356 --> 00:50:12,270
OK.

891
00:50:12,313 --> 00:50:14,098
When I say vain, you say--

892
00:50:14,141 --> 00:50:17,188
When I say vain, you say--

893
00:50:17,231 --> 00:50:18,102
Idiots!

894
00:50:18,145 --> 00:50:19,059
Glorious!

895
00:50:19,103 --> 00:50:20,626
Reply is glorious!

896
00:50:20,669 --> 00:50:21,453
Idiots!

897
00:50:21,496 --> 00:50:22,410
Glorious!

898
00:50:22,454 --> 00:50:24,804
The reply is glorious!

899
00:50:24,847 --> 00:50:27,372
It's ironically hard to
get a good call or response

900
00:50:27,415 --> 00:50:29,852
game with echoes.

901
00:50:29,896 --> 00:50:30,810
Ah!

902
00:50:30,853 --> 00:50:31,376
Daddy!

903
00:50:31,419 --> 00:50:32,290
Daddy!

904
00:50:33,552 --> 00:50:35,206
Imbecile brothers.

905
00:50:35,249 --> 00:50:36,859
Imbecile brothers.

906
00:50:36,903 --> 00:50:40,254
I'm so happy you can join
the festivities in honor of

907
00:50:40,298 --> 00:50:42,952
and sponsored by me.

908
00:50:42,996 --> 00:50:44,693
A brochure?

909
00:50:44,737 --> 00:50:50,786
Archiebold you have risked our
family's business over a bet.

910
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:51,396
Bet?

911
00:50:51,439 --> 00:50:53,093
What bet?

912
00:50:53,137 --> 00:50:54,877
Oh, that guy.

913
00:50:54,921 --> 00:50:56,618
Don't even, daddy.

914
00:50:56,662 --> 00:50:59,969
He's in third place which is so
many places behind first place.

915
00:51:00,013 --> 00:51:02,363
You couldn't even count
him if you wanted to.

916
00:51:02,407 --> 00:51:09,675
If you lose Muddy Meadows,
you lose everything.

917
00:51:09,718 --> 00:51:11,155
Everything?

918
00:51:11,198 --> 00:51:13,809
Please, daddy, I'm not
as moronic as my brothers.

919
00:51:13,853 --> 00:51:14,636
No offense.

920
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,855
Well, some offense.

921
00:51:15,898 --> 00:51:19,380
I've taken out an
insurance policy.

922
00:51:20,207 --> 00:51:21,687
It's V.

923
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:22,340
You
don't have to say, It's V,

924
00:51:22,383 --> 00:51:23,776
every time.

925
00:51:23,819 --> 00:51:24,864
Your name shows up on
my phone when you call.

926
00:51:24,907 --> 00:51:26,387
It's how phones work.

927
00:51:26,431 --> 00:51:27,171
Never mind.

928
00:51:27,214 --> 00:51:28,737
What do you want?

929
00:51:28,781 --> 00:51:31,000
Nearly striking out with
the goat so it's up to you.

930
00:51:31,044 --> 00:51:33,046
You want me to
beat up the goat?

931
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:36,354
No, I want you to
find Zhi's weakness.

932
00:51:36,397 --> 00:51:37,790
Greetings, dance fans.

933
00:51:37,833 --> 00:51:40,401
And welcome to the
Nuorilang Falls Ball.

934
00:51:40,445 --> 00:51:43,274
And what a beautiful
place to be.

935
00:51:58,158 --> 00:51:58,811
Hey.

936
00:51:58,854 --> 00:51:59,681
Muddy Meadows.

937
00:51:59,725 --> 00:52:00,552
You realize--

938
00:52:00,595 --> 00:52:01,379
If you take--

939
00:52:01,422 --> 00:52:02,119
Tomorrow--

940
00:52:02,162 --> 00:52:03,294
By 20 minutes--

941
00:52:03,337 --> 00:52:04,164
You'll only be--

942
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:04,860
10 minutes--

943
00:52:04,904 --> 00:52:06,210
From the top.

944
00:52:06,253 --> 00:52:08,516
If you can pull that
off, mate, the next day,

945
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:12,781
you'd have a real
chance at the cup.

946
00:52:12,825 --> 00:52:13,608
Too right.

947
00:52:13,652 --> 00:52:14,566
Touch a nitro.

948
00:52:14,609 --> 00:52:15,610
I hope you seal the deal.

949
00:52:15,654 --> 00:52:17,221
Yeah, that'd be great.

950
00:52:17,264 --> 00:52:20,311
But nitro is a bit outside
our budget which is nothing.

951
00:52:24,619 --> 00:52:26,317
Whoa, seriously?

952
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:28,014
Thanks.

953
00:52:28,057 --> 00:52:32,497
This could really help us
close that 29-minute gap, kid.

954
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:33,062
Kid?

955
00:52:47,381 --> 00:52:51,211
So this is what a burgeoning
superstar does in his off time.

956
00:52:51,255 --> 00:52:53,431
I'm no superstar.

957
00:52:53,474 --> 00:52:55,911
Oh, then what are
you doing on my cup?

958
00:53:01,134 --> 00:53:04,093
So last time I
saw you, I believe

959
00:53:04,137 --> 00:53:08,228
you were asking me to dance.

960
00:53:08,272 --> 00:53:09,229
Was I?

961
00:53:09,273 --> 00:53:09,751
Whoa!

962
00:53:13,929 --> 00:53:16,193
Looking good, kid.

963
00:53:16,236 --> 00:53:16,889
OK.

964
00:53:25,941 --> 00:53:27,987
OK, whoa, slow
down there, Speedy.

965
00:53:34,036 --> 00:53:35,081
See?

966
00:53:35,124 --> 00:53:36,387
Isn't that better?

967
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:36,952
Yeah.

968
00:53:45,265 --> 00:53:46,527
I like the way you dance.

969
00:53:46,571 --> 00:53:48,747
Then you should
probably thank my Granny.

970
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:51,315
She's the only person
I've ever danced with.

971
00:53:51,358 --> 00:53:54,274
She taught me all my moves.

972
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:57,973
Well, how do you like it
then dancing with someone else?

973
00:53:58,017 --> 00:53:58,887
I like it.

974
00:53:58,931 --> 00:54:00,062
A lot less elbow skin.

975
00:54:23,608 --> 00:54:24,739
I'm sorry.

976
00:54:24,783 --> 00:54:26,001
I can't.

977
00:54:26,045 --> 00:54:27,481
Not like this.

978
00:54:27,525 --> 00:54:29,527
But wait!

979
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:31,093
Shelby!

980
00:54:31,137 --> 00:54:31,616
Hey.

981
00:54:39,406 --> 00:54:41,365
Something get
under your warts, V?

982
00:54:41,408 --> 00:54:43,192
Oh, there she is.

983
00:54:43,236 --> 00:54:46,239
Tell me what's the dirt
on my little friend?

984
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:48,415
You told me you were
getting even with someone

985
00:54:48,459 --> 00:54:50,112
who double crossed you.

986
00:54:50,156 --> 00:54:51,984
You didn't say anything about
hurting an innocent loris

987
00:54:52,027 --> 00:54:53,899
and destroying my
childhood home.

988
00:54:53,942 --> 00:54:55,553
I'm out.

989
00:54:55,596 --> 00:54:58,991
You came to me appealing to
my love of taking advantage

990
00:54:59,034 --> 00:55:00,732
of the helpless in
their times of need

991
00:55:00,775 --> 00:55:03,082
and, in detriment,
my evil whims,

992
00:55:03,125 --> 00:55:06,172
and asked me to have your
father's name cleared

993
00:55:06,215 --> 00:55:08,305
for a crime that I
clearly framed him

994
00:55:08,348 --> 00:55:12,787
for which I did for you and
which, of course, I can undo.

995
00:55:12,831 --> 00:55:17,575
Therefore, when I
say jump, you say--

996
00:55:17,618 --> 00:55:19,533
You say--

997
00:55:19,577 --> 00:55:21,274
How high?

998
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:22,580
Right.

999
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:25,800
And when I say side
vegetable, you say--

1000
00:55:25,844 --> 00:55:27,280
Stewed carrots?

1001
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:28,803
Ooh, nice one.

1002
00:55:28,847 --> 00:55:29,804
And when I say--

1003
00:55:29,848 --> 00:55:31,197
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

1004
00:55:35,419 --> 00:55:36,333
Bop, bop, bop.

1005
00:55:42,904 --> 00:55:47,605
What the-- Shelby
and the Vainglorious?

1006
00:55:47,648 --> 00:55:50,956
Oh, no, this is going
to kill the kid.

1007
00:55:50,999 --> 00:55:54,655
Well, don't let him find
out until the race is over.

1008
00:55:54,699 --> 00:55:59,094
And when I say dream
first date, you say--

1009
00:55:59,138 --> 00:56:01,053
Moonlit dance
beside a waterfall

1010
00:56:01,096 --> 00:56:03,925
with a sweet guy
who makes me laugh.

1011
00:56:03,969 --> 00:56:06,754
I would have also
accepted putting on a show.

1012
00:56:11,759 --> 00:56:12,760
Blimey!

1013
00:56:12,804 --> 00:56:14,153
How did I don't see it before?

1014
00:56:14,196 --> 00:56:16,938
It's so obvious.

1015
00:56:16,982 --> 00:56:18,418
See what?

1016
00:56:18,462 --> 00:56:20,202
Perhaps if you're
standing where I'm standing

1017
00:56:20,246 --> 00:56:22,248
and I'm standing
where you're standing,

1018
00:56:22,291 --> 00:56:24,424
you could see what
I clearly see.

1019
00:56:24,468 --> 00:56:27,949
Go, stand where I was standing.

1020
00:56:27,993 --> 00:56:28,472
Hmm.

1021
00:56:28,515 --> 00:56:29,821
Huh?

1022
00:56:29,864 --> 00:56:32,519
What exactly am I
supposed to be seeing?

1023
00:56:32,563 --> 00:56:33,433
You're right.

1024
00:56:33,477 --> 00:56:35,522
It is worse this way.

1025
00:56:35,566 --> 00:56:37,916
Go back, go back, go back.

1026
00:56:37,959 --> 00:56:38,743
Hmm?

1027
00:56:38,786 --> 00:56:39,961
What?

1028
00:56:40,005 --> 00:56:41,659
What you are
supposed to be saying

1029
00:56:41,702 --> 00:56:45,619
is that you two silly lorises
are falling for each other.

1030
00:56:45,663 --> 00:56:48,622
You are the secret
weapon I've been

1031
00:56:48,666 --> 00:56:50,276
looking for the whole time.

1032
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:52,713
So wouldn't it just
break his simple heart

1033
00:56:52,757 --> 00:56:57,631
to learn that you've been
working for me all along?

1034
00:56:57,675 --> 00:56:58,327
Pow!

1035
00:56:58,371 --> 00:57:01,113
No.

1036
00:57:01,156 --> 00:57:04,333
Welcome race fans to
day 3 of this Silk Road Rally.

1037
00:57:04,377 --> 00:57:07,467
Today's course takes us right
through the Stone Forest.

1038
00:57:07,511 --> 00:57:09,426
- A
- forest made of stone?

1039
00:57:09,469 --> 00:57:10,862
I can't believe this.

1040
00:57:18,173 --> 00:57:19,174
Huh?

1041
00:57:19,218 --> 00:57:20,480
Oh, Zhi, great, there you are.

1042
00:57:20,524 --> 00:57:22,090
In the car, let's go.

1043
00:57:22,134 --> 00:57:23,875
I got to hand
it to you, Gnash.

1044
00:57:23,918 --> 00:57:26,181
You were totally right
making a stop for Shelby.

1045
00:57:26,225 --> 00:57:26,965
She is--

1046
00:57:27,008 --> 00:57:28,140
Dead weight, yeah.

1047
00:57:28,183 --> 00:57:29,358
I don't know what
I was thinking.

1048
00:57:29,402 --> 00:57:32,318
That's not what
I was going to say.

1049
00:57:33,232 --> 00:57:34,625
You seem a little jumpy.

1050
00:57:34,668 --> 00:57:35,234
Yes?

1051
00:57:35,277 --> 00:57:36,017
What?

1052
00:57:36,061 --> 00:57:37,062
What do you want?

1053
00:57:37,105 --> 00:57:37,758
Here, let me get that for you.

1054
00:57:37,802 --> 00:57:38,803
Gnash, what the?

1055
00:57:38,846 --> 00:57:40,892
Oh, no, the window is broken.

1056
00:57:40,935 --> 00:57:43,895
Uhh--

1057
00:57:43,938 --> 00:57:46,245
Shelby doesn't love you.

1058
00:57:46,288 --> 00:57:48,203
She works for me.

1059
00:57:48,247 --> 00:57:49,466
What's he saying?

1060
00:57:49,509 --> 00:57:53,034
She does it long
view rehearse the flea?

1061
00:57:53,078 --> 00:57:53,948
Cuckoo, am I right?

1062
00:58:00,085 --> 00:58:00,868
Uh-oh.

1063
00:58:00,912 --> 00:58:02,783
Hey, Gnash!

1064
00:58:02,827 --> 00:58:04,393
What the heck?

1065
00:58:04,437 --> 00:58:06,744
These screens are a
serious distraction.

1066
00:58:06,787 --> 00:58:07,658
They destroy focus.

1067
00:58:07,701 --> 00:58:09,703
You can't have that.

1068
00:58:09,747 --> 00:58:11,052
You're welcome.

1069
00:58:11,096 --> 00:58:12,837
All racers
to your vehicles.

1070
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,535
Oh, yes, finally, here we go.

1071
00:58:45,217 --> 00:58:47,175
Last night,
dancing with Shelby,

1072
00:58:47,219 --> 00:58:49,351
it was like a dream come true.

1073
00:58:49,395 --> 00:58:51,310
But one I never
even knew I wanted.

1074
00:58:51,353 --> 00:58:52,398
Ah-ha.

1075
00:58:52,441 --> 00:58:53,573
Well, look out.

1076
00:58:53,617 --> 00:58:55,575
What if she never comes back?

1077
00:58:55,619 --> 00:58:57,316
How could I ever be
happy again knowing

1078
00:58:57,359 --> 00:58:58,752
what life could have been?

1079
00:58:58,796 --> 00:58:59,666
I couldn't, Gnash.

1080
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:02,364
I just couldn't.

1081
00:59:02,408 --> 00:59:05,846
Then again, a winter
wedding would be so Shelby.

1082
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:07,065
But a summer wedding--

1083
00:59:07,108 --> 00:59:08,632
Oh, enough already.

1084
00:59:08,675 --> 00:59:11,417
You've been talking about
this girl for 1,000 miles.

1085
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:13,854
You need to get your
head back in this race.

1086
00:59:13,898 --> 00:59:15,943
How's this for
head in the race?

1087
00:59:15,987 --> 00:59:18,555
Whoa, kid, that's
100% pure nitro.

1088
00:59:18,598 --> 00:59:21,253
You will just--

1089
00:59:21,296 --> 00:59:22,559
Holy moly.

1090
00:59:25,126 --> 00:59:30,131
Zhi just took off like a roo
with a rocket in its rump.

1091
00:59:38,313 --> 00:59:40,707
After I save
Granny's house, I think

1092
00:59:40,751 --> 00:59:42,796
maybe I'll get a
place of my own,

1093
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:45,407
something worthy of
Shelby, you know.

1094
00:59:45,451 --> 00:59:47,627
I'm thinking karaoke room.

1095
00:59:47,671 --> 00:59:49,020
Oh, for the love of--

1096
00:59:49,063 --> 00:59:50,761
Hey, seriously, what
is up with you today?

1097
00:59:50,804 --> 00:59:51,283
Who?

1098
00:59:51,326 --> 00:59:52,980
Me?

1099
00:59:53,024 --> 00:59:54,939
You're the one that wants to
quit yammering on about Shelby

1100
00:59:54,982 --> 00:59:56,418
when you should be racing.

1101
00:59:56,462 --> 00:59:58,159
You're jealous.

1102
00:59:58,203 --> 01:00:00,640
Oh, what in the world
would I be jealous of?

1103
01:00:00,684 --> 01:00:05,079
Me because it's not the
amazing Gnash show this time.

1104
01:00:05,123 --> 01:00:07,212
Oh, give me a
break, wouldn't you?

1105
01:00:09,867 --> 01:00:12,870
Team Muddy Meadows
have broken the land speed

1106
01:00:12,913 --> 01:00:14,567
record.

1107
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,613
Yeah, they're
definitely going to crash.

1108
01:00:18,919 --> 01:00:20,051
Whoa, we're too hot.

1109
01:00:20,094 --> 01:00:21,052
Lay off the nitro.

1110
01:00:27,014 --> 01:00:27,928
Come on!

1111
01:00:27,972 --> 01:00:28,494
Whoa!

1112
01:00:44,771 --> 01:00:45,467
Yes!

1113
01:00:45,511 --> 01:00:46,730
Go, Zhi-zhi, go!

1114
01:00:49,428 --> 01:00:51,560
Let's take
another look at that finish.

1115
01:00:51,604 --> 01:00:52,257
Yes, Speedy!

1116
01:00:59,046 --> 01:01:00,961
You could have killed us.

1117
01:01:01,005 --> 01:01:03,224
Nitro can't handle
that kind of heat.

1118
01:01:03,268 --> 01:01:05,052
You can't handle
that kind of heat.

1119
01:01:08,012 --> 01:01:11,276
Your pistons are misfiring, son.

1120
01:01:14,975 --> 01:01:16,716
You are just like your mother.

1121
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,196
As soon as you
don't get your way,

1122
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:20,154
you just fly off the handle.

1123
01:01:20,198 --> 01:01:21,765
My mother?

1124
01:01:28,772 --> 01:01:31,731
I taught her how to race.

1125
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:34,734
My mother raced cars?

1126
01:01:34,778 --> 01:01:38,390
And she was great
too just like you.

1127
01:01:38,433 --> 01:01:41,741
But then this one rally,
we were racing as a team.

1128
01:01:41,785 --> 01:01:45,571
And I signaled to her
to slow down and not

1129
01:01:45,614 --> 01:01:48,487
take the easy pass,
but she couldn't

1130
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:52,447
resist so she blazed by me.

1131
01:01:52,491 --> 01:01:58,018
And-- and when she hit
that next turn, she--

1132
01:01:58,062 --> 01:02:00,629
She what, Gnash?

1133
01:02:00,673 --> 01:02:04,546
She-- she should
have listened to me.

1134
01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:08,159
What happened, Gnash?

1135
01:02:08,202 --> 01:02:09,682
I lost my best friend.

1136
01:02:21,476 --> 01:02:23,914
We could have been amazing.

1137
01:02:23,957 --> 01:02:25,002
Could have been amazing.

1138
01:02:31,095 --> 01:02:32,618
Oh, yeah?

1139
01:02:32,661 --> 01:02:35,839
If I had middle fingers,
you'd all know it right now.

1140
01:02:39,843 --> 01:02:41,627
Hey, what's this?

1141
01:02:44,848 --> 01:02:46,414
One, get out of here.

1142
01:02:46,458 --> 01:02:47,024
Get away.

1143
01:02:47,067 --> 01:02:47,676
Go on.

1144
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:48,634
Shoo.

1145
01:02:48,677 --> 01:02:50,070
It's all mine--

1146
01:02:50,114 --> 01:02:53,857
the trophy, Muddy Meadows,
totally conditional

1147
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:56,120
love of my family.

1148
01:02:56,163 --> 01:02:59,819
Echoes, cue the
victory simulation.

1149
01:03:07,653 --> 01:03:09,350
Well, that
was a dramatic end

1150
01:03:09,394 --> 01:03:11,918
to a dramatic day, folks.

1151
01:03:11,962 --> 01:03:14,486
He and Vainglorious somehow now

1152
01:03:14,529 --> 01:03:16,227
both in first place.

1153
01:03:16,270 --> 01:03:18,664
And with his car and
his relationship with teammate

1154
01:03:18,707 --> 01:03:22,102
Gnash both up in flames,
there's suddenly no way for Zhi

1155
01:03:22,146 --> 01:03:25,671
to finish the rally,
let alone win it.

1156
01:03:25,714 --> 01:03:26,803
He needs us.

1157
01:03:37,161 --> 01:03:37,683
Oh!

1158
01:03:37,726 --> 01:03:38,640
Yeah!

1159
01:03:38,684 --> 01:03:40,120
Haha!

1160
01:03:40,164 --> 01:03:42,253
Hey, there she is.

1161
01:03:42,296 --> 01:03:43,341
There she is.

1162
01:03:43,384 --> 01:03:45,256
Oh, what are you
so happy about?

1163
01:03:45,299 --> 01:03:46,474
Haven't you heard?

1164
01:03:46,518 --> 01:03:49,521
Zhi is out of the race.

1165
01:03:49,564 --> 01:03:50,522
We did it!

1166
01:03:50,565 --> 01:03:53,873
You and me, the two amigos.

1167
01:03:53,917 --> 01:03:55,222
I don't want this.

1168
01:03:55,266 --> 01:03:56,615
Oh, don't be shy.

1169
01:03:56,658 --> 01:03:59,357
Take a pic.

1170
01:03:59,400 --> 01:03:59,879
Shelby?

1171
01:04:02,621 --> 01:04:04,623
Zhi, what are you--

1172
01:04:04,666 --> 01:04:07,931
what are you-- what are you--
what are you doing here?

1173
01:04:07,974 --> 01:04:09,976
I came to make a trade--

1174
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:12,413
me for the village.

1175
01:04:12,457 --> 01:04:14,372
How noble of you.

1176
01:04:14,415 --> 01:04:19,899
But seeing as your leverage
just blew up-- what?

1177
01:04:19,943 --> 01:04:21,596
Five minutes ago?

1178
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:24,469
Yeah, I was kind of hoping
you didn't hear about that yet.

1179
01:04:24,512 --> 01:04:28,516
I think I'll just take
you and the village.

1180
01:04:31,606 --> 01:04:34,348
Echo Training Program?

1181
01:04:34,392 --> 01:04:36,220
Benefits?

1182
01:04:36,263 --> 01:04:37,221
Wait a second.

1183
01:04:37,264 --> 01:04:39,136
Why are you here, Shelby?

1184
01:04:39,179 --> 01:04:41,486
What-- what's going on?

1185
01:04:41,529 --> 01:04:44,793
Well, OK-- so this
is a crazy story.

1186
01:04:44,837 --> 01:04:46,708
You'll think this is funny.

1187
01:04:46,752 --> 01:04:50,364
The thing is-- well the--

1188
01:04:53,324 --> 01:04:56,370
Oh, enough with
the dramatic pauses.

1189
01:04:56,414 --> 01:04:59,286
The lady loris works for me.

1190
01:04:59,330 --> 01:05:00,113
No, no, wait.

1191
01:05:00,157 --> 01:05:01,114
It's not like that.

1192
01:05:01,158 --> 01:05:03,508
I hired her to destroy you.

1193
01:05:03,551 --> 01:05:04,378
How did she do?

1194
01:05:09,122 --> 01:05:12,560
She killed it.

1195
01:05:12,604 --> 01:05:13,083
Speedy.

1196
01:05:16,651 --> 01:05:19,480
Well, that was awkward.

1197
01:05:22,179 --> 01:05:24,703
Oh, what an
emotional roller coaster

1198
01:05:24,746 --> 01:05:26,487
ride this has been for Zhi.

1199
01:05:26,531 --> 01:05:30,230
And now, it looks like
everyone's favorite slow loris

1200
01:05:30,274 --> 01:05:33,320
is in for a dark
night of the soul.

1201
01:05:33,364 --> 01:05:35,888
It feels like a
saxophone moment to me.

1202
01:06:12,316 --> 01:06:14,579
Zhi-zhi, where did
you find that car?

1203
01:06:24,763 --> 01:06:27,853
Kid, you're a force of nature.

1204
01:06:27,896 --> 01:06:31,813
That was the coolest
thing I've ever seen.

1205
01:06:31,857 --> 01:06:34,294
When will you find your Dao?

1206
01:07:13,246 --> 01:07:14,682
Going
somewhere, Gnash?

1207
01:07:14,726 --> 01:07:19,818
Granny Bai,
what are you doing here?

1208
01:07:19,861 --> 01:07:23,517
Making sure the past
doesn't repeat itself.

1209
01:07:23,561 --> 01:07:27,956
You need to help him
finally embrace his Dao.

1210
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,656
I think you
should talk to Zhi.

1211
01:07:31,699 --> 01:07:34,398
You owe me this, Gnash.

1212
01:07:34,441 --> 01:07:37,053
And you owe it to Zhi.

1213
01:07:37,096 --> 01:07:41,970
But mostly, you
owe it to yourself.

1214
01:07:42,014 --> 01:07:47,019
It wasn't your fault.

1215
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:49,717
It was nice to see
you again, Granny.

1216
01:07:49,761 --> 01:07:52,677
You take care of yourself.

1217
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:53,504
Aw!

1218
01:07:53,547 --> 01:07:55,158
Aw, aw, aw, aw, aw.

1219
01:07:55,201 --> 01:07:57,334
Granny, let go.

1220
01:07:57,377 --> 01:07:58,596
Oh, come on, Granny.

1221
01:08:04,167 --> 01:08:06,517
"Don't be an idiot."

1222
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:08,214
Well, that's a good one.

1223
01:08:08,258 --> 01:08:11,087
Darn bumper stickers, why do
they have to be so persuasive?

1224
01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:12,000
So persuasive.

1225
01:08:21,619 --> 01:08:23,490
Next race to
start in one hour.

1226
01:08:23,534 --> 01:08:24,056
What?

1227
01:08:43,249 --> 01:08:45,947
The plant just
knows how to grow.

1228
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:06,272
Zhi!

1229
01:09:06,316 --> 01:09:07,143
Zhi!

1230
01:09:07,186 --> 01:09:08,796
Where have you been?

1231
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:10,233
Come on, it's Berpe.

1232
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:17,065
Zhi!

1233
01:09:17,109 --> 01:09:18,893
Look at what my Berpe did.

1234
01:09:18,937 --> 01:09:22,201
It was awesome and
a little disgusting.

1235
01:09:22,245 --> 01:09:25,987
I swear I have a whole
new respect for men.

1236
01:09:26,031 --> 01:09:28,860
Come and meet the
little tailbiters.

1237
01:09:28,903 --> 01:09:31,384
They're so cute.

1238
01:09:31,428 --> 01:09:32,733
Wow.

1239
01:09:32,777 --> 01:09:34,082
Hi.

1240
01:09:34,126 --> 01:09:35,432
They're beautiful.

1241
01:09:35,475 --> 01:09:38,304
Everyone, say hi to Uncle Zhi.

1242
01:09:46,356 --> 01:09:49,359
Look at him all tuckered out.

1243
01:09:49,402 --> 01:09:51,448
I'm so proud of him.

1244
01:09:51,491 --> 01:09:54,929
But doc says he's in no
condition to finish the rally.

1245
01:09:54,973 --> 01:09:57,845
Well, then, we can watch
the last leg together

1246
01:09:57,889 --> 01:10:00,370
because I'm out too.

1247
01:10:00,413 --> 01:10:01,458
No, Zhi.

1248
01:10:01,501 --> 01:10:04,025
This is where our road led us.

1249
01:10:04,069 --> 01:10:06,985
But you, you need to
get back out there

1250
01:10:07,028 --> 01:10:09,857
and find out where
your road goes.

1251
01:10:09,901 --> 01:10:11,250
But even if I wanted to--

1252
01:10:11,294 --> 01:10:13,687
Zhi, we are a familia.

1253
01:10:13,731 --> 01:10:17,256
I cannot sit here and let
you offer this a hook.

1254
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:18,953
No.

1255
01:10:18,997 --> 01:10:22,653
Familia, we push each other
forward even when we think we

1256
01:10:22,696 --> 01:10:27,571
can't possibly go on, especially
when we think we can't.

1257
01:10:27,614 --> 01:10:29,616
You can do this, Zhi.

1258
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:33,098
We believe in you.

1259
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:39,278
Shelby?

1260
01:10:39,322 --> 01:10:41,411
I'm so sorry.

1261
01:10:41,454 --> 01:10:44,022
Everything Vainglorious
said is true.

1262
01:10:44,065 --> 01:10:45,676
When we met, I was
working for him

1263
01:10:45,719 --> 01:10:47,373
but I didn't really
know what I was doing

1264
01:10:47,417 --> 01:10:48,505
or who I was doing it to.

1265
01:10:48,548 --> 01:10:50,333
And then-- and then we met.

1266
01:10:50,376 --> 01:10:52,030
And we got along so well.

1267
01:10:52,073 --> 01:10:55,294
And you-- you were the kid
with the soup pot on your head.

1268
01:10:55,338 --> 01:10:57,078
And then I realized
that you were fighting

1269
01:10:57,122 --> 01:11:00,865
for the Loris Village which
meant that I was the one trying

1270
01:11:00,908 --> 01:11:02,823
to destroy it.

1271
01:11:02,867 --> 01:11:04,129
Shelby, I get it.

1272
01:11:04,172 --> 01:11:05,304
You didn't know.

1273
01:11:05,348 --> 01:11:06,958
No, but that
doesn't make it right.

1274
01:11:07,001 --> 01:11:09,439
My whole life, I have been
trying to find my way back

1275
01:11:09,482 --> 01:11:10,091
to the village.

1276
01:11:11,702 --> 01:11:14,835
And when you offered
it to me, I betrayed you.

1277
01:11:14,879 --> 01:11:18,665
But I want to make it right
so that's what I'm doing here.

1278
01:11:18,709 --> 01:11:23,322
I'm trying to do right by
the guy I'm sort of into.

1279
01:11:23,366 --> 01:11:25,933
The guy you're sort of into?

1280
01:11:29,502 --> 01:11:30,373
She loves me!

1281
01:11:30,416 --> 01:11:31,504
Did you guys hear that?

1282
01:11:31,548 --> 01:11:34,377
She totally loves me.

1283
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:36,596
Whoa, slow down there, Speedy.

1284
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,599
We still got a race to finish.

1285
01:11:39,643 --> 01:11:41,122
Shelby, I--

1286
01:11:41,166 --> 01:11:42,950
I blew up my car.

1287
01:11:42,994 --> 01:11:45,344
There's no way for me
to finish the race.

1288
01:11:45,388 --> 01:11:49,305
There's-- there's not going
to be a village to go back to.

1289
01:11:49,348 --> 01:11:49,827
Unless--

1290
01:11:54,701 --> 01:11:56,355
Isn't this Neil's car?

1291
01:11:56,399 --> 01:11:57,530
Not anymore.

1292
01:12:03,710 --> 01:12:06,104
The starting line is
the other direction.

1293
01:12:06,147 --> 01:12:06,931
Oh, I know.

1294
01:12:11,501 --> 01:12:13,111
Hey, wait.

1295
01:12:13,154 --> 01:12:13,633
Gnash.

1296
01:12:18,377 --> 01:12:19,378
Zhi?

1297
01:12:19,422 --> 01:12:20,379
Gnash?

1298
01:12:20,423 --> 01:12:21,728
What are you doing here, kid?

1299
01:12:24,731 --> 01:12:26,994
I'm so sorry about
what I said, Gnash.

1300
01:12:27,038 --> 01:12:30,781
You've been nothing but good
to me, and I blew it all up.

1301
01:12:30,824 --> 01:12:32,348
We blew it up.

1302
01:12:32,391 --> 01:12:34,219
I'm sorry too, kid.

1303
01:12:34,262 --> 01:12:37,309
I should have told you
about your mama sooner.

1304
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:39,746
And then when the
road got rough,

1305
01:12:39,790 --> 01:12:42,662
I just up and split
without so much as a glance

1306
01:12:42,706 --> 01:12:44,403
in the rearview.

1307
01:12:44,447 --> 01:12:46,536
You know, truth is I would
have been on that bus

1308
01:12:46,579 --> 01:12:48,929
there too if an old
friend hadn't stopped by

1309
01:12:48,973 --> 01:12:51,367
to drop some wisdom on me.

1310
01:12:51,410 --> 01:12:54,021
An old friend?

1311
01:12:54,065 --> 01:12:55,849
Come
on now, you two.

1312
01:12:55,893 --> 01:12:57,416
I'm not that old.

1313
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:57,938
Granny!

1314
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:03,857
I'm sorry, Zhi-zhi.

1315
01:13:03,901 --> 01:13:05,206
I never intended--

1316
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:06,164
It's OK, Granny.

1317
01:13:06,207 --> 01:13:06,730
It's OK.

1318
01:13:09,472 --> 01:13:11,822
I'm so proud of you.

1319
01:13:11,865 --> 01:13:14,433
You're proud of me?

1320
01:13:14,477 --> 01:13:16,130
Even though I'm racing?

1321
01:13:16,174 --> 01:13:19,133
Because you're racing.

1322
01:13:19,177 --> 01:13:22,180
You found your Dao, Zhi, Zhi.

1323
01:13:22,223 --> 01:13:23,747
Now, go save our home.

1324
01:13:26,358 --> 01:13:28,447
I hate to be the one
to break it to you guys,

1325
01:13:28,491 --> 01:13:32,016
but I think it might be a
little too late for that.

1326
01:13:32,059 --> 01:13:33,626
Too late?

1327
01:13:33,670 --> 01:13:37,021
But you're the one who said,
"Races aren't won or lost

1328
01:13:37,064 --> 01:13:39,197
until the final second."

1329
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:39,937
Hmm?

1330
01:13:39,980 --> 01:13:41,199
Yeah.

1331
01:13:41,242 --> 01:13:42,113
Again, that's not
what I sound like.

1332
01:13:45,159 --> 01:13:47,771
Well, race fans,
it's the last day of the rally.

1333
01:13:47,814 --> 01:13:50,904
And with Zhi out, the only
question on everyone's mind

1334
01:13:50,948 --> 01:13:52,384
is--

1335
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:53,646
Why don't croissants
come in any other shapes?

1336
01:13:53,690 --> 01:13:55,039
No, not that.

1337
01:13:55,082 --> 01:13:57,737
Can anyone else left
in this race actually

1338
01:13:57,781 --> 01:14:00,305
beat Archie Vainglorious?

1339
01:14:00,348 --> 01:14:01,480
Of course not.

1340
01:14:04,222 --> 01:14:05,223
Where's Zhi?

1341
01:14:06,616 --> 01:14:09,357
Yeah, he's totes
going to miss the race.

1342
01:14:09,401 --> 01:14:12,491
His village is going
to be destroyed.

1343
01:14:12,535 --> 01:14:18,454
We've got to find a
way to buy him some time.

1344
01:14:18,497 --> 01:14:20,499
Lovely idea, lads.

1345
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:22,458
All right, you lot,
follow our lead.

1346
01:14:35,122 --> 01:14:35,601
Hm?

1347
01:14:38,604 --> 01:14:39,126
Hmm.

1348
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:54,446
Huh?

1349
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:02,280
Tucks away.

1350
01:15:06,850 --> 01:15:09,417
Well, that's just a waste
of perfectly good tea pots.

1351
01:15:15,772 --> 01:15:18,949
Hey, what are you doing?

1352
01:15:18,992 --> 01:15:20,820
7 minutes
in, and the other teams

1353
01:15:20,864 --> 01:15:23,127
have a deadlock on Vainglorious.

1354
01:15:23,170 --> 01:15:25,172
Wow,
this map is really handy.

1355
01:15:31,701 --> 01:15:33,441
Oh, we
are four hours now.

1356
01:15:33,485 --> 01:15:36,575
And these guys have no intention
of letting Vainglorious pass.

1357
01:15:36,619 --> 01:15:37,968
Four hours?

1358
01:15:38,011 --> 01:15:40,710
It was just 7 minutes
like 12 seconds ago.

1359
01:15:40,753 --> 01:15:41,885
Oh, that's a lot of numbers.

1360
01:15:41,928 --> 01:15:43,451
My head hurts.

1361
01:15:48,848 --> 01:15:50,894
I don't know
what these guys are up to,

1362
01:15:50,937 --> 01:15:52,548
but they're up to something.

1363
01:16:03,297 --> 01:16:04,864
They're corralling him.

1364
01:16:04,908 --> 01:16:06,997
Five trapped Vainglorious.

1365
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:07,563
Oh.

1366
01:16:13,307 --> 01:16:13,786
Ta-ta!

1367
01:16:16,659 --> 01:16:19,575
Ta-ta!

1368
01:16:19,618 --> 01:16:22,012
And Vainglorious
has broken free.

1369
01:16:22,055 --> 01:16:24,928
Who would've seen that coming?

1370
01:16:24,971 --> 01:16:25,493
Ha!

1371
01:16:31,369 --> 01:16:32,326
Ha-ha!

1372
01:16:32,370 --> 01:16:33,284
Ahh!

1373
01:16:33,327 --> 01:16:34,764
Huh?

1374
01:16:34,807 --> 01:16:35,721
Ugh!

1375
01:16:35,765 --> 01:16:37,723
Huh?

1376
01:16:46,297 --> 01:16:49,605
Well, folks, it seems like
it's a great day for evil

1377
01:16:49,648 --> 01:16:53,173
everywhere as Archie
Vainglorious has just secured

1378
01:16:53,217 --> 01:16:54,914
himself a certain victory.

1379
01:16:59,092 --> 01:17:00,311
Yey!

1380
01:17:00,354 --> 01:17:01,529
Hang on a second.

1381
01:17:01,573 --> 01:17:02,530
What's this?

1382
01:17:05,490 --> 01:17:07,535
Some fool has just
joined the race.

1383
01:17:07,579 --> 01:17:09,755
Is that Neil?

1384
01:17:09,799 --> 01:17:11,191
Oh!

1385
01:17:11,235 --> 01:17:12,845
Oh, no way,
that's not some fool.

1386
01:17:12,889 --> 01:17:18,068
It's Muddy Meadows,
the mini miracle!

1387
01:17:18,111 --> 01:17:19,939
Mini miracle?

1388
01:17:19,983 --> 01:17:21,985
Oh, that's a cool nickname.

1389
01:17:34,737 --> 01:17:36,477
There it is, Shanghai!

1390
01:17:42,222 --> 01:17:45,095
You got this, Speedy.

1391
01:17:45,138 --> 01:17:48,664
If there's ever been
a more exciting race for a cup,

1392
01:17:48,707 --> 01:17:52,102
I, for one, cannot recall it.

1393
01:17:52,145 --> 01:17:53,843
I've got to agree.

1394
01:17:53,886 --> 01:17:55,366
That's because this
is the first race you've ever

1395
01:17:55,409 --> 01:17:56,889
seen, Juni.

1396
01:17:56,933 --> 01:17:58,412
I've got
to agree with you again.

1397
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:03,635
Steady, steady.

1398
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:05,028
Ha-ha!

1399
01:18:05,071 --> 01:18:06,159
As if, loris.

1400
01:18:06,203 --> 01:18:07,857
As if.

1401
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:10,511
I can't get past him.

1402
01:18:10,555 --> 01:18:12,426
Not yet.

1403
01:18:12,470 --> 01:18:12,949
Not yet.

1404
01:18:16,039 --> 01:18:16,561
Now!

1405
01:18:23,742 --> 01:18:25,135
Cheerio!

1406
01:18:25,178 --> 01:18:27,572
Ahh!

1407
01:18:27,615 --> 01:18:30,488
Yeah, way to go, kid.

1408
01:18:34,405 --> 01:18:35,275
Hm?

1409
01:18:35,319 --> 01:18:36,363
Uh-- right--

1410
01:18:36,407 --> 01:18:38,278
left-- right?

1411
01:18:38,322 --> 01:18:39,366
Hold on.

1412
01:18:41,455 --> 01:18:43,370
Whoa!

1413
01:18:43,414 --> 01:18:44,371
Uh--

1414
01:18:44,415 --> 01:18:46,809
Speedy!

1415
01:18:46,852 --> 01:18:47,374
Ahh!

1416
01:18:51,335 --> 01:18:53,772
Dang it!

1417
01:19:01,824 --> 01:19:03,216
Hm?

1418
01:19:08,265 --> 01:19:10,180
Ahhh!

1419
01:19:10,223 --> 01:19:11,355
Back up, back up!

1420
01:19:11,398 --> 01:19:12,704
You can get around
him and take it.

1421
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:13,923
Coming down, look out!

1422
01:19:13,966 --> 01:19:15,489
You're not going
to make it through!

1423
01:19:19,102 --> 01:19:19,929
Forward, Zhi!

1424
01:19:19,972 --> 01:19:21,321
Forward fast, forward!

1425
01:19:26,196 --> 01:19:29,939
Oh, Vainglorious
has pulled ahead yet again.

1426
01:19:29,982 --> 01:19:32,898
And this time, it looks
like it's curtains for Zhi.

1427
01:19:34,508 --> 01:19:36,075
What are we going to do?

1428
01:19:36,119 --> 01:19:37,076
Gnash?

1429
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:38,599
I'm sorry.

1430
01:19:38,643 --> 01:19:40,558
I'm all out of bumper stickers.

1431
01:19:40,601 --> 01:19:41,777
Speedy?

1432
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:43,779
Hmm?

1433
01:19:59,272 --> 01:20:00,447
Go save our home.

1434
01:20:05,409 --> 01:20:08,891
What exactly is going through
that giant head of yours right

1435
01:20:08,934 --> 01:20:10,501
now, kid?

1436
01:20:10,544 --> 01:20:14,374
Like you said, when I'm
behind, I'm a force of nature.

1437
01:20:18,161 --> 01:20:20,554
Oh, stiffen the
wombat and thump the lizard.

1438
01:20:20,598 --> 01:20:23,644
The mini miracle is headed
straight into a colossal death

1439
01:20:23,688 --> 01:20:25,168
spiral.

1440
01:20:25,211 --> 01:20:26,517
It sounds
like a very stupid idea.

1441
01:20:43,664 --> 01:20:44,665
This is crazy.

1442
01:21:20,397 --> 01:21:22,616
The cup is mine!

1443
01:21:26,969 --> 01:21:27,491
No!

1444
01:21:33,410 --> 01:21:37,936
Well, vanquish me
Vegemite and call me a koala.

1445
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:39,764
You are a koala.

1446
01:21:39,807 --> 01:21:43,028
The mini miracle
has just won the first

1447
01:21:43,072 --> 01:21:46,118
ever Silk Road Race!

1448
01:21:47,859 --> 01:21:48,686
We did it!

1449
01:21:55,127 --> 01:21:55,649
Hey.

1450
01:21:59,610 --> 01:22:00,828
I'm his friend!

1451
01:22:00,872 --> 01:22:01,351
Go, Zhi!

1452
01:22:27,681 --> 01:22:29,640
Zhi, can I have
your autograph please?

1453
01:22:29,683 --> 01:22:32,121
That was great.

1454
01:22:32,164 --> 01:22:33,600
Hey, you did it.

1455
01:22:33,644 --> 01:22:36,081
What's up, Zhi?

1456
01:22:36,125 --> 01:22:39,476
Hey, it's supposed to
say the Amazing Gnash.

1457
01:22:43,088 --> 01:22:44,220
Fired!

1458
01:22:44,263 --> 01:22:44,916
Fired!

1459
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:45,438
Fired.

1460
01:22:45,482 --> 01:22:46,222
Fired.

1461
01:22:46,265 --> 01:22:46,787
Fired.

1462
01:22:46,831 --> 01:22:47,310
Fired.

1463
01:22:47,353 --> 01:22:47,875
Fired.

1464
01:22:47,919 --> 01:22:48,702
Fired.

1465
01:22:48,746 --> 01:22:50,356
Fired.

1466
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,010
Hey, Vainglorious.

1467
01:22:52,054 --> 01:22:54,926
Ready to settle that bet?

1468
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:57,711
I'm sorry what bet was that?

1469
01:22:59,017 --> 01:23:00,801
We got you, Zhi.

1470
01:23:00,845 --> 01:23:01,324
Hmm?

1471
01:23:07,852 --> 01:23:11,899
We had-- someone must
have hacked my account.

1472
01:23:11,943 --> 01:23:15,642
Daddy, you appeared to
have accidentally nabbed me

1473
01:23:15,686 --> 01:23:17,122
with your giant claw device.

1474
01:23:20,430 --> 01:23:23,302
Yes.

1475
01:23:23,346 --> 01:23:23,868
Look.

1476
01:23:29,265 --> 01:23:30,222
We did it!

1477
01:23:30,266 --> 01:23:31,745
Let me think.

1478
01:23:31,789 --> 01:23:33,269
I never really liked that
neighborhood anyway--

1479
01:23:33,312 --> 01:23:35,445
too many lorises-- sees?

1480
01:23:35,488 --> 01:23:36,707
Lorisees?

1481
01:23:36,750 --> 01:23:37,664
Lorises.

1482
01:23:37,708 --> 01:23:38,404
Lorisi?

1483
01:23:38,448 --> 01:23:40,798
Aw.

1484
01:23:40,841 --> 01:23:42,756
I'm really going
to miss that guy.

1485
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:43,496
Really?

1486
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:44,019
No.

1487
01:23:59,425 --> 01:24:00,209
OK.

1488
01:24:00,252 --> 01:24:01,384
Yay, Granny.

1489
01:24:01,427 --> 01:24:02,341
Go, Granny.

1490
01:24:02,385 --> 01:24:03,342
Go, Granny.

1491
01:24:03,386 --> 01:24:04,300
Oh, yeah.

1492
01:24:04,343 --> 01:24:05,692
Oh, yeah.

1493
01:24:05,736 --> 01:24:06,215
Hey.

1494
01:24:14,788 --> 01:24:18,618
You know I seem to recall
we've been here before.

1495
01:24:18,662 --> 01:24:21,186
Or was it here?

1496
01:24:21,230 --> 01:24:25,103
Actually, I think
I was more like here.

1497
01:24:25,147 --> 01:24:26,800
Oh, that's right.

1498
01:24:26,844 --> 01:24:31,457
Hmm, I can't remember
what happened next.

1499
01:24:31,501 --> 01:24:32,328
Not this.

1500
01:24:35,113 --> 01:24:38,725
Zhi-zhi, Shelby, are
we going to play or not?

1501
01:24:42,425 --> 01:24:43,817
Whoa.

1502
01:24:43,861 --> 01:24:46,037
I don't know why
I call you, Speedy.

1503
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:46,559
Hmm?

1504
01:24:59,006 --> 01:25:01,052
Yellow mountain fruit peak?

1505
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:03,620
I know it was
always your favorite.

1506
01:25:03,663 --> 01:25:04,360
Your favorite?

1507
01:25:07,232 --> 01:25:09,626
I'm still getting
used to that.

1508
01:25:09,669 --> 01:25:11,149
All right, game on.

1509
01:25:11,193 --> 01:25:14,152
OK, but Shelby has to take
it easy on me this time.

1510
01:25:14,196 --> 01:25:15,327
Not a chance.

1511
01:25:15,371 --> 01:25:16,633
I've been learning
from the best.

1512
01:25:16,676 --> 01:25:18,983
Thank you.

1513
01:25:19,026 --> 01:25:21,159
Wait, I've lived
with her all my life.

1514
01:25:21,203 --> 01:25:23,118
How come I never learn
to play like this?

1515
01:25:23,161 --> 01:25:25,642
Because you actually
have to listen.

1516
01:25:28,253 --> 01:25:31,300
Oh, and as the sun
sets over this happily restored

1517
01:25:31,343 --> 01:25:35,042
Slow Loris community, there's
only one thing left to say.

1518
01:25:35,086 --> 01:25:37,306
This story
is a lot like that turtle

1519
01:25:37,349 --> 01:25:38,263
and the rabbit one.

1520
01:25:38,307 --> 01:25:39,525
No, that's--

1521
01:25:39,569 --> 01:25:41,048
forget it.

1522
01:25:41,092 --> 01:25:44,356
I get
to be in the sequel, yeah?

1523
01:25:45,227 --> 01:25:46,141
OK, OK.

1524
01:25:46,184 --> 01:25:49,231
I got a rhythm in my body.

1525
01:25:49,274 --> 01:25:50,275
No way, no way.

1526
01:25:50,319 --> 01:25:53,626
Nobody's going to stop me now.

1527
01:25:53,670 --> 01:25:54,888
Today, today.

1528
01:25:54,932 --> 01:25:56,760
I'm going to hold
onto the feeling,

1529
01:25:56,803 --> 01:26:00,111
not going to worry
about the reasons.

1530
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:02,157
No.

1531
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:06,378
The song is getting started
to the beating of my heart.

1532
01:26:06,422 --> 01:26:11,340
And it's getting
me carried away.

1533
01:26:11,383 --> 01:26:13,342
I got the feeling,
feeling right now.

1534
01:26:13,385 --> 01:26:15,866
Keeping it moving,
and I'm making a part.

1535
01:26:19,348 --> 01:26:20,566
Hey!

1536
01:26:20,610 --> 01:26:22,786
This is electric,
electric in there.

1537
01:26:22,829 --> 01:26:25,789
Back in the rhythm and
I ain't going to stop.

1538
01:26:37,235 --> 01:26:38,758
OK, OK.

1539
01:26:38,802 --> 01:26:42,197
Walking on the air like magic.

1540
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:43,459
No way, no way.

1541
01:26:43,502 --> 01:26:46,157
I ain't going to let
them drag me down.

1542
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:47,506
Today, today.

1543
01:26:47,550 --> 01:26:49,204
I'm going to hold
onto that feeling.

1544
01:26:49,247 --> 01:26:53,251
I've been awaken
from my dreaming.

1545
01:26:53,295 --> 01:26:55,210
Oh.

1546
01:26:55,253 --> 01:26:59,431
Something is getting started,
the beating of a heart.

1547
01:26:59,475 --> 01:27:03,696
It's getting me carried away.

1548
01:27:03,740 --> 01:27:06,221
I got the feeling,
feeling right now.

1549
01:27:06,264 --> 01:27:08,701
Keeping it moving,
and I'm making a part.

1550
01:27:12,227 --> 01:27:13,402
Hey!

1551
01:27:13,445 --> 01:27:15,142
This is electric,
electric in there.

1552
01:27:15,186 --> 01:27:17,667
Back in the room, and
I ain't going to stop.

1553
01:27:40,037 --> 01:27:43,519
Something getting started.

1554
01:27:43,562 --> 01:27:45,390
There's something
getting started--

1555
01:27:47,958 --> 01:27:54,660
the beating of a heart,
the beating, the beating,

1556
01:27:54,704 --> 01:27:56,836
the beating of a heart.

1557
01:27:56,880 --> 01:28:00,971
Something getting started.

1558
01:28:01,014 --> 01:28:05,454
There's something
getting started--

1559
01:28:05,497 --> 01:28:12,417
the beating of a heart,
the beating, the beating,

1560
01:28:12,461 --> 01:28:14,419
the beating of a heart.

1561
01:28:14,463 --> 01:28:16,943
I got the feeling,
feeling right now.

1562
01:28:16,987 --> 01:28:19,163
Keeping it moving,
and I'm making a part.

1563
01:28:23,036 --> 01:28:24,255
Hey!

1564
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:25,648
This is electric,
electric in there.

1565
01:28:25,691 --> 01:28:27,737
Back in the room, and
I ain't going to stop.
