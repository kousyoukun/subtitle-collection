00:00:44,051 --> 00:00:50,081
This film is
based on real-life events.

2
00:01:24,525 --> 00:01:25,685
Hey, Ebony!

3
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,193
You bastard! I'll knife you in the back!

4
00:01:30,765 --> 00:01:34,064
- Get this guy out of here!
- There's no more room.

5
00:01:34,235 --> 00:01:39,070
We've got to use this cell!
Cool it or there'll be trouble!

6
00:01:41,175 --> 00:01:43,302
Get off me!

7
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,704
I wanna see that. Come on!

8
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,678
You've betrayed me!

9
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,985
Dagger! I'll kill you, you hear?
Stick you like a pig.

10
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,420
Ebony, Lula's freaked out...

11
00:01:57,592 --> 00:02:00,425
...says it's his right to kill Dagger.

12
00:02:00,595 --> 00:02:02,654
Lula needs to be taught a lesson!

13
00:02:03,464 --> 00:02:06,729
Whatever's happened...

14
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:09,301
...it's not for you to decide,
you little shit!

15
00:02:09,804 --> 00:02:13,171
- Dagger!
- Dagger's gonna die!

16
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:16,977
- Gonna die!
- Calm down!

17
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:23,146
You think you're gonna decide this?
Come on, then, I'm ready.

18
00:02:23,317 --> 00:02:26,047
- What's this?
- Gonna die! Gonna die!

19
00:02:28,656 --> 00:02:31,750
Like I said, I've got no one
waiting for me on the outside.

20
00:02:31,993 --> 00:02:34,120
I'm in no hurry to get out.

21
00:02:34,295 --> 00:02:36,160
Anyone wants a fight,
let's get on with it.

22
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,560
I'll crush all of you.

23
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:45,232
What the fuck's wrong with you guys?!
Let's cool it here!

24
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,308
What's going on, Dagger?

25
00:02:48,476 --> 00:02:51,968
- Lula attacked me from behind, Ebony.
- He's a badass!

26
00:02:52,146 --> 00:02:54,614
He went for Dagger from behind!

27
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,508
Right out of line, man!

28
00:02:57,251 --> 00:02:58,718
Gonna die!

29
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,747
Gonna die!

30
00:03:08,796 --> 00:03:12,630
- You locking me in there, Ebony?
- First get in there, then speak!

31
00:03:14,268 --> 00:03:17,066
- Don't throw Dagger in here, Ebony.
- We don't want trouble.

32
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,830
Step away, damn it!

33
00:03:20,007 --> 00:03:22,840
So? I'm all ears.

34
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,212
How come he's so mad at you?

35
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:27,040
You heard.

36
00:03:27,215 --> 00:03:30,446
Lula came out of nowhere with a knife
and tried to kill me.

37
00:03:30,618 --> 00:03:32,017
I dodged.

38
00:03:32,186 --> 00:03:35,644
We scuffled till they broke us up.

39
00:03:36,324 --> 00:03:38,849
The rest you know.

40
00:03:55,343 --> 00:03:56,640
Good morning, Mr. Pires.

41
00:03:57,712 --> 00:04:01,113
I do apologize for this
disgusting behavior...

42
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:05,647
...which has invaded our household
today.

43
00:04:07,488 --> 00:04:13,449
Only this idiot Lula,
a young, inexperienced con...

44
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:18,330
...suddenly got this attitude,
without even asking permission!

45
00:04:18,499 --> 00:04:21,297
Dagger killed my father!
He killed my father!

46
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,460
I sure did, kid.

47
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:27,540
And not only him,
I've killed plenty more besides.

48
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:31,644
Ebony! Mr. Pires!
Dagger killed my father...

49
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:35,374
...in front of my mother.
He's been telling everyone!

50
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,577
You gonna deny that, asshole?!
Are you gonna deny it? Are you?

51
00:04:39,754 --> 00:04:42,348
- Ebony, please.
- What?

52
00:04:42,523 --> 00:04:44,923
Tell the kid he doesn't know
half the story.

53
00:04:45,092 --> 00:04:48,357
- Lf he did...
- Son of a bitch! I'll kill you!

54
00:04:48,963 --> 00:04:53,491
Tell him to ask his mother if she
was really as upset as all that.

55
00:04:53,768 --> 00:04:57,670
Or was it a relief when I came
and grabbed his belt from him?

56
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,397
Lies! That's a lie!

57
00:04:59,574 --> 00:05:03,476
Like hell it is! I saw it for myself.

58
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,048
He'd have thrashed her to death.

59
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:17,021
I thought you'd have heard
by now, kid!

60
00:05:20,394 --> 00:05:23,693
Your mother paid me
to kill your father.

61
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,724
Get it now?

62
00:05:28,135 --> 00:05:29,932
It was your mother who wiped him out!

63
00:05:56,364 --> 00:05:57,592
Hear that?

64
00:06:01,168 --> 00:06:02,362
He's calmed down!

65
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,113
He's calmed down!

66
00:06:15,883 --> 00:06:18,374
I want them both out here
in their underwear.

67
00:06:46,681 --> 00:06:51,414
Lula, as far as I'm concerned,
we're quits.

68
00:06:56,557 --> 00:06:58,024
Let's forget it, shall we?

69
00:07:03,664 --> 00:07:08,465
You've put me to shame, and on
the day of the doctor's first visit.

70
00:07:16,143 --> 00:07:19,374
So, Lula, what brought
you back in here?

71
00:07:19,547 --> 00:07:21,174
I left here...

72
00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:24,580
...went home and found
my wife in bed with someone else.

73
00:07:24,752 --> 00:07:27,346
The son of a bitch had the nerve
to tell me, "That's life."

74
00:07:27,521 --> 00:07:29,989
I shot him three times just
to prove the contrary.

75
00:07:30,157 --> 00:07:34,617
You should know that whatever
goes on outside gets settled outside.

76
00:07:36,063 --> 00:07:40,329
In here, anyone who behaves
knows we'll do what we can...

77
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:45,632
...to show him the front door,
where his family is waiting.

78
00:07:46,273 --> 00:07:50,471
But anyone who's proud of being
a criminal, with blood in his eye...

79
00:07:51,645 --> 00:07:55,081
...we'll do everything to
prolong his life in here.

80
00:07:56,183 --> 00:07:59,084
We usually forget people
like that in here.

81
00:08:04,925 --> 00:08:07,257
Doctor, this is Ebony.

82
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:15,233
Yes, doctor,
Ebony's got a problem.

83
00:08:16,237 --> 00:08:19,138
My kitchen knife is still missing.

84
00:08:20,341 --> 00:08:23,003
Whoever took it,
I'll give you one chance.

85
00:08:23,778 --> 00:08:28,238
Return it or there'll be
one prisoner dead every day!

86
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,845
I'd like to ask our visitors
to turn their backs...

87
00:08:33,654 --> 00:08:36,452
...since there's an ashamed
crook present.

88
00:08:37,591 --> 00:08:41,186
But when I turn around...

89
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,289
...I sure would like to see that knife.

90
00:08:46,467 --> 00:08:48,526
I'll count to three.

91
00:08:49,003 --> 00:08:50,527
One...

92
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,463
...two...

93
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,837
I'm turning.

94
00:08:58,012 --> 00:08:59,343
Three.

95
00:09:08,022 --> 00:09:10,422
- From your kitchen?
- Yes, sir.

96
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:16,596
This is the yellow wing, doctor,
because they're afraid.

97
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,994
It's like a jail within the jail.

98
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:22,158
They're locked up here for their
own safety. They're scared.

99
00:09:22,336 --> 00:09:26,397
Career killers, rapists,
stool pigeons, bad payers.

100
00:09:26,574 --> 00:09:28,906
In here, you know,
prisoners never forgive.

101
00:09:29,076 --> 00:09:32,512
Mr. Pires, don't these people
ever get sun? It's so musty!

102
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,482
Anyone want to go outside?

103
00:09:38,652 --> 00:09:42,713
Take a walk in the yard?
Get some fresh air?

104
00:09:57,605 --> 00:10:01,905
- What do these people do all day?
- They come and go all day long...

105
00:10:02,076 --> 00:10:05,170
...think they're busy,
but it gets them nowhere.

106
00:10:05,546 --> 00:10:08,538
Doctor, 7000 men in jail!

107
00:10:08,716 --> 00:10:11,116
There are 1800
in this pavilion alone.

108
00:10:11,685 --> 00:10:11,886
If they knew how AIDS is spread,
that would already help.

109
00:10:11,886 --> 00:10:15,652
If they knew how AIDS is spread,
that would already help.

110
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:20,624
They catch the disease and have sex,
so there's no stopping the epidemic.

111
00:10:20,794 --> 00:10:24,457
The only ones who'll listen to your
advice are the really smart ones...

112
00:10:24,632 --> 00:10:28,159
...who only want to get out alive
in order to keep robbing.

113
00:10:28,335 --> 00:10:29,529
That's their whole life.

114
00:10:29,703 --> 00:10:33,571
Maybe. But they're living
at the center of the disease.

115
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,139
- They're the prisoners here.
- Prisoners?

116
00:10:37,444 --> 00:10:41,642
They own this cell. This place doesn't
explode because they don't want it to.

117
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,174
God bless you, child.

118
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,413
I didn't know you had a family.

119
00:10:50,424 --> 00:10:53,484
I thought I'd lost it.

120
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:55,559
My whole life in jail...

121
00:10:55,729 --> 00:10:57,788
...but even so I raised 18 kids...

122
00:10:57,965 --> 00:11:00,695
...and not one of them has even been
near a police station.

123
00:11:01,135 --> 00:11:03,729
That girl, my youngest...

124
00:11:03,938 --> 00:11:06,270
...she said she doesn't remember
my face...

125
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,431
...so she's decided to come and visit.

126
00:11:09,276 --> 00:11:15,146
I'd like you to authorize me to see her.

127
00:11:15,316 --> 00:11:18,479
I don't want my daughter
around all the scum.

128
00:11:18,953 --> 00:11:21,183
That's going to be tricky.

129
00:11:21,355 --> 00:11:24,017
What if the 7000 others
ask me the same thing?

130
00:11:26,026 --> 00:11:27,550
Excuse me.

131
00:11:33,701 --> 00:11:34,759
Good morning.

132
00:11:43,611 --> 00:11:45,340
Hey, what's up?

133
00:11:53,387 --> 00:11:58,120
Need anything, doctor?
Coffee, sugar, chocolate, toothpaste?

134
00:11:58,359 --> 00:12:01,294
Joints are only two packs
of Marlboros each. Want one?

135
00:12:01,462 --> 00:12:02,952
I don't smoke.

136
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:07,123
Too bad! Commerce, doctor!
Makes the world go round!

137
00:12:12,306 --> 00:12:13,398
Let's go.

138
00:12:15,175 --> 00:12:16,802
Easy, now. That's it.

139
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,413
Slow.

140
00:12:25,486 --> 00:12:27,249
He can't spit there.

141
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:30,647
Tuberculosis. Anyone steps
on that, spreads the disease.

142
00:12:31,225 --> 00:12:35,355
If he had the strength,
he'd go to the sink.

143
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,088
It's not easy.

144
00:12:39,233 --> 00:12:40,825
He must be isolated.

145
00:12:42,736 --> 00:12:44,226
But where, doctor?

146
00:12:51,612 --> 00:12:52,601
Name?

147
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,112
Everyone calls me the Beard.

148
00:12:57,351 --> 00:12:58,818
Why are you here?

149
00:12:59,853 --> 00:13:00,945
Well...

150
00:13:01,522 --> 00:13:03,387
...my brother was killed.

151
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:08,822
Two days later, the murderer
had a little meeting with death...

152
00:13:09,396 --> 00:13:12,058
...so suspicions fell upon my
good self.

153
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:18,298
Some said I did it and others came
along and said they saw it wasn't me.

154
00:13:18,706 --> 00:13:22,642
With some saying it was me
and others saying not...

155
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:27,804
...here I am, five years now,
waiting for the judge to decide.

156
00:13:28,749 --> 00:13:32,845
Do you have sex here in jail?

157
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:37,589
- Anyone who denies that is a liar.
- Use condoms?

158
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,023
If I've got one, I do.

159
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,921
- IV drugs?
- How dare you, doctor?

160
00:13:43,097 --> 00:13:46,555
I wonder, Beard!
What's that mark on your arm?

161
00:13:53,073 --> 00:13:54,836
Beard is next!

162
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,858
My name's Alípio.

163
00:14:14,528 --> 00:14:16,155
Do you use drugs?

164
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,831
Needles?

165
00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:23,800
No way, doctor. I got AIDS from
all the ass I've had in jail.

166
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,403
Plenty of ass.

167
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,769
Is it still worth taking the test?

168
00:14:35,682 --> 00:14:38,310
I listen, give advice...

169
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:41,113
...a little tenderness,
hold them tight...

170
00:14:41,855 --> 00:14:44,983
...and then they always give us
something nice in return.

171
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:49,755
A pack of cigarettes, some candy,
a slice of cheese.

172
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:53,466
So many men shut up
in here, doctor...

173
00:14:53,634 --> 00:14:56,626
...without our feminine support.

174
00:14:56,804 --> 00:14:59,398
Yeah, I've got AIDS,
but I didn't get it in here.

175
00:14:59,573 --> 00:15:02,406
I brought it in off the streets,
and I can't complain.

176
00:15:02,576 --> 00:15:07,980
You come in here sick and they
treat you with respect, dignity...

177
00:15:08,148 --> 00:15:11,083
...and that's the greatest thing
in a crook's life.

178
00:15:11,251 --> 00:15:13,082
I'm a junkie and a dealer.

179
00:15:13,253 --> 00:15:17,917
In my business, if a guy doesn't
pay up, I can't take back...

180
00:15:18,091 --> 00:15:21,492
...what I sold him. The bastard's
already smoked it, snorted it.

181
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,154
I take whatever he's got.

182
00:15:24,531 --> 00:15:27,193
If he's got nothing, I kill him.

183
00:15:28,702 --> 00:15:32,194
The other day I tried to get
an extra banana from the guy...

184
00:15:32,372 --> 00:15:35,739
...who delivers lunch. The bastard
said only if I kissed his banana.

185
00:15:35,909 --> 00:15:38,377
So what the hell,
I'm just crazy about bananas.

186
00:15:38,545 --> 00:15:41,776
Doctor, everyone in my cell's
got this itch.

187
00:15:41,949 --> 00:15:43,280
It's unbearable.

188
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,685
Scabies. I'll give you some medicine.

189
00:15:48,388 --> 00:15:50,549
So how are you getting along?

190
00:15:51,058 --> 00:15:55,893
Doctor, after shooting cocaine
in the dark with a blunt needle...

191
00:15:56,063 --> 00:15:58,725
...drawing blood with this rig...

192
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:01,265
...is hardly fair play.

193
00:16:03,036 --> 00:16:04,594
Too bad!

194
00:17:11,338 --> 00:17:12,930
See what you did?

195
00:17:13,607 --> 00:17:15,234
See what you did?

196
00:18:40,694 --> 00:18:42,491
- Who are you?
- I'm the doctor.

197
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:45,029
I was taking blood samples.

198
00:18:45,198 --> 00:18:47,189
- Just ask...
- Watch out!

199
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:49,995
Like you have
to tell me who to ask.

200
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:54,402
I'm calling the duty officer.
Wait here.

201
00:18:54,574 --> 00:18:57,509
If no one can identify you,
you're staying right where you are.

202
00:19:23,904 --> 00:19:26,634
Don't take it personally.
It's their job to escape...

203
00:19:26,873 --> 00:19:28,636
...and mine not to let them.

204
00:19:38,585 --> 00:19:39,813
Doctor!

205
00:19:42,823 --> 00:19:44,290
You coming back?

206
00:19:59,806 --> 00:20:04,971
I knew many of those men hadn't
shown their victims any mercy...

207
00:20:05,145 --> 00:20:07,579
...but society has its judges.

208
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,841
And I wasn't one of them.

209
00:20:10,217 --> 00:20:13,414
At the same time,
what did I have to do with all that?

210
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,555
I had two choices;

211
00:20:15,722 --> 00:20:18,350
Forget or go back.

212
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,287
Take a deep breath.

213
00:20:25,365 --> 00:20:26,491
Smoker?

214
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:27,894
Just cigarettes.

215
00:20:28,702 --> 00:20:30,761
- No crack?
- Never.

216
00:20:31,505 --> 00:20:32,995
Sleep well?

217
00:20:33,306 --> 00:20:35,900
Hardly, doctor.
The mind never stops...

218
00:20:36,076 --> 00:20:40,172
...what with one guy trying to settle
a score outside, collecting a debt...

219
00:20:40,347 --> 00:20:44,010
...another trying to dig a tunnel.
And there goes another day.

220
00:20:44,184 --> 00:20:48,382
- You still got much time to do?
- A few more years.

221
00:20:48,688 --> 00:20:50,087
And why did you come here?

222
00:20:50,257 --> 00:20:53,852
- Legitimate self-defense, doctor.
- That lands you in jail nowadays?

223
00:20:54,027 --> 00:20:55,221
It did in my case.

224
00:20:55,395 --> 00:20:59,195
Here's what happened.
It was Christmas...

225
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,563
...the bells ringing,
snow in the windows.

226
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:08,666
Me, Bristles and Fatso arranged
to do a jewelry store job.

227
00:21:10,677 --> 00:21:14,773
Neat work, doctor.
Never even fired a shot.

228
00:21:15,882 --> 00:21:17,679
The problem was later.

229
00:21:57,123 --> 00:21:59,318
How are we going to split it up?

230
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:02,120
Fatso and I will make three
piles and you choose first.

231
00:22:05,432 --> 00:22:09,129
Son, not now.
Get out! Go on!

232
00:22:09,636 --> 00:22:10,898
Go on, son!

233
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:34,455
You fucking moron!

234
00:22:35,128 --> 00:22:38,154
We're splitting the loot and you
come at me with your hand covered?

235
00:22:43,436 --> 00:22:45,301
It's his own fault he died.

236
00:22:48,141 --> 00:22:49,699
What the fuck's going on?

237
00:22:51,311 --> 00:22:53,404
So you shot him in the heat of
the moment...

238
00:22:55,115 --> 00:22:58,778
...but we had agreed for me
to shoot you...

239
00:22:59,185 --> 00:23:01,119
...so we could take your share.

240
00:23:01,288 --> 00:23:02,778
So shoot!

241
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,322
Go on, fire away!

242
00:23:12,532 --> 00:23:14,090
I can't, damn it.

243
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,133
Give me your rod.

244
00:23:22,175 --> 00:23:23,938
Oh, my God!

245
00:23:29,115 --> 00:23:34,178
Being betrayed by your buddy for
nothing, doctor...

246
00:23:34,521 --> 00:23:39,788
...like Judas, the guy who
spat in the face of Jesus.

247
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,928
So how does the story end?

248
00:23:42,329 --> 00:23:45,321
It ends with me in here,
before your eyes, doctor.

249
00:23:45,498 --> 00:23:47,898
Fatso was arrested in
under two months.

250
00:23:48,101 --> 00:23:52,538
Doctor, ever seen a fat man
being beaten? They talk too much.

251
00:24:17,797 --> 00:24:20,630
A man was killed here.
Did you see anything?

252
00:24:20,934 --> 00:24:22,162
No.

253
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,139
Jesus, Fatso. You turned me in
for Bristles' murder!

254
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:35,280
You could have just squealed
about the robbery.

255
00:24:35,982 --> 00:24:39,645
I fingered you for murder because
Bristles' brother would kill me.

256
00:24:40,453 --> 00:24:43,650
We left his place together
for the jewelry store...

257
00:24:43,823 --> 00:24:47,088
...then I came back alive
and he got back dead.

258
00:24:49,629 --> 00:24:51,119
I'm very upset.

259
00:24:53,433 --> 00:24:56,527
I could turn you in as an accomplice...

260
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,736
...but I won't. I'll back your story up.

261
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:04,234
I killed him and I threw him
in the river all by myself.

262
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:10,807
Thanks, Ebony!
I knew I could count on you.

263
00:25:12,352 --> 00:25:16,152
I'll forgive you,
but you owe me one.

264
00:25:17,257 --> 00:25:18,986
And did Fatso ever pay his debt?

265
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:23,323
No way! Fatso died trying to escape.

266
00:25:23,496 --> 00:25:27,125
They spent two years
digging a tunnel.

267
00:25:37,143 --> 00:25:38,440
Wait!

268
00:25:42,682 --> 00:25:44,547
Let's go, come on!

269
00:25:51,291 --> 00:25:52,485
I'm stuck!

270
00:25:55,161 --> 00:25:59,063
Go on, Fatso!
Hurry up, you big pile of shit!

271
00:25:59,232 --> 00:26:00,563
Go on, damn it!

272
00:26:01,234 --> 00:26:02,895
Give me a hand!

273
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:06,363
- I'm stuck.
- Breathe in, man.

274
00:26:06,673 --> 00:26:09,164
- Suck yourself in.
- What do you mean?

275
00:26:09,342 --> 00:26:12,743
- I can't!
- Go back, then.

276
00:26:12,979 --> 00:26:15,948
- Go on!
- Give me a break, Cadão.

277
00:26:16,149 --> 00:26:20,415
- Pull, go on, pull!
- Shit, Fatso, I told you!

278
00:26:20,587 --> 00:26:24,546
- Eating everyone else's leftovers.
- Pull, go on!

279
00:26:28,895 --> 00:26:32,387
Fatso's frustrated brothers knifed him.

280
00:26:34,601 --> 00:26:36,501
Hell of a way to die, eh, doctor?

281
00:26:36,703 --> 00:26:40,469
Right under the Virgin Mary
and not even she could protect him.

282
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,307
Too bad.

283
00:26:44,344 --> 00:26:45,641
What about this pain?

284
00:26:46,246 --> 00:26:50,580
Your problem, Ebony, is stress.
What bigshot executives get.

285
00:26:51,017 --> 00:26:54,418
Take one of these before bed.
They'll help you sleep.

286
00:26:54,587 --> 00:26:58,023
- Lf you don't get better, come back.
- God protect you, doctor.

287
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:05,555
Doctor, come and see...

288
00:27:05,899 --> 00:27:08,060
...Chico's balloon, quick!

289
00:27:17,143 --> 00:27:19,008
It's the old man's obsession,
doctor.

290
00:27:30,056 --> 00:27:31,614
Oh, too bad!

291
00:27:32,158 --> 00:27:33,523
May I?

292
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:35,361
Hi, I'm Lady.

293
00:27:35,361 --> 00:27:37,226
Hi, I'm Lady.

294
00:27:37,397 --> 00:27:42,562
- Lady Di. I've come to take the test.
- Please, take a seat.

295
00:27:52,946 --> 00:27:55,437
First I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

296
00:27:57,483 --> 00:27:59,417
I've seen this movie before,
doctor.

297
00:28:00,787 --> 00:28:05,156
I've never needed a blood transfusion
and I never pierce my veins.

298
00:28:07,193 --> 00:28:10,856
The only drug I use is
a joint now and then...

299
00:28:11,264 --> 00:28:14,893
...when I watch TV
or for a little romance.

300
00:28:15,134 --> 00:28:17,762
And partners? How many?

301
00:28:19,172 --> 00:28:20,696
Oh, about 2000.

302
00:28:41,127 --> 00:28:44,119
The silicone you used
isn't meant for that.

303
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:47,297
As if I had the money
for something better, doctor.

304
00:28:47,467 --> 00:28:49,162
Ever taken hormones?

305
00:28:49,335 --> 00:28:53,601
No way! Hormones are dreadful!
You take them and nothing happens.

306
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,936
And what our clients like, maybe
you know, is to play the girl.

307
00:28:59,445 --> 00:29:03,973
Well, Lady, I think the time's come
for you to find out if you're sick.

308
00:29:06,486 --> 00:29:08,454
I'll do it, doctor.

309
00:29:09,589 --> 00:29:10,817
Will it hurt?

310
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,423
Just a little.

311
00:29:43,856 --> 00:29:45,380
Get out, man!

312
00:29:50,763 --> 00:29:55,962
Hallowed by thy name,
Thy kingdom come

313
00:29:56,135 --> 00:30:01,004
Thy will be done,
On Earth as it is in heaven

314
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,573
Give us this day
Our daily bread

315
00:30:28,501 --> 00:30:29,763
Any room in there?

316
00:30:35,241 --> 00:30:36,265
Sure.

317
00:30:43,983 --> 00:30:45,678
Only it'll cost you 200.

318
00:30:46,152 --> 00:30:48,882
Pay for a bed? I'm in jail, man!

319
00:30:51,758 --> 00:30:54,022
So? Did you live for free
on the outside?

320
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,857
If you want to stay, sleep on the floor.

321
00:31:02,969 --> 00:31:05,369
Deusdete ain't sleeping on no floor.

322
00:31:07,106 --> 00:31:09,301
He already has a place.

323
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,412
Deusdete.

324
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,184
Just like I said, right, brother?

325
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:21,611
You ended up doing something
you shouldn't.

326
00:31:26,692 --> 00:31:28,853
Men with cell phones...

327
00:31:29,028 --> 00:31:34,398
...were patrolling the neighborhood.

328
00:31:40,139 --> 00:31:46,009
It was 4 p.m., the day before
yesterday. It was 4 p. M...

329
00:32:16,409 --> 00:32:17,671
And the rat?

330
00:32:17,877 --> 00:32:22,143
I smashed it against the wall
about 10 times!

331
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:28,719
Damn thing wouldn't let go!

332
00:32:28,888 --> 00:32:29,946
It died?

333
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:36,892
Like hell it did! So I grabbed it
and stuck my teeth into its brain.

334
00:32:37,063 --> 00:32:39,691
Then I just brushed my teeth
and that was that.

335
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:45,437
Easy, man! You've been beaten with
iron bars and never made a sound.

336
00:32:45,605 --> 00:32:47,300
Sweet Mama, pray for me!

337
00:32:56,716 --> 00:32:58,877
Cut your finger, Highness?

338
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:05,122
Jesus, Lula, smoking crack?
You can't operate like that!

339
00:33:05,291 --> 00:33:08,419
Sorry, doctor, only I operate
better when I smoke.

340
00:33:08,661 --> 00:33:11,323
What?! You can't keep
a steady hand on crack!

341
00:33:11,497 --> 00:33:15,729
That's where you're wrong. I see the
veins all shining and fluorescent.

342
00:33:15,902 --> 00:33:18,393
Looks like that casino
in Las Vegas!

343
00:33:20,239 --> 00:33:21,968
Take it easy, man!

344
00:33:22,174 --> 00:33:24,506
See, doctor, isn't that great?

345
00:33:24,677 --> 00:33:27,510
Steady as a rock and hardly
a millimeter between stitches.

346
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,615
God protect you, Lula.
God bless you, God bless you all.

347
00:33:30,783 --> 00:33:34,241
That's enough of God, Highness,
you're not kidding anyone.

348
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,411
What, you married twice?

349
00:33:36,656 --> 00:33:39,853
Well, doctor, to me life's
a merry-go-round...

350
00:33:40,026 --> 00:33:42,221
...and just the one horse isn't enough.

351
00:33:42,428 --> 00:33:45,454
That one there. That's Dalva's.

352
00:33:46,032 --> 00:33:47,624
My princess.

353
00:34:03,049 --> 00:34:06,883
Honey, score a goal for me?

354
00:34:07,053 --> 00:34:09,578
Score a goal for me, please?

355
00:34:12,725 --> 00:34:14,090
Like it?

356
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,454
Yeah, I bet you do.

357
00:34:28,074 --> 00:34:31,339
- You believe in love at first sight?
- What?

358
00:34:33,045 --> 00:34:36,208
Come with me. I'm going to ask
your parents for your hand.

359
00:34:36,382 --> 00:34:40,011
- You don't even know me!
- You're wrong!

360
00:34:40,319 --> 00:34:43,948
- Wrong? You don't know me.
- Sure I do.

361
00:34:44,156 --> 00:34:47,523
- I know you just love spicy...
- Sausage.

362
00:34:47,693 --> 00:34:52,790
And I know you look gorgeous
in that pretty dress.

363
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:56,027
And I know you deserve better
than that klutz over there.

364
00:34:56,202 --> 00:34:57,294
My fiancé!

365
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,301
- Fiancé?!
- Fiancé.

366
00:35:00,806 --> 00:35:02,637
You're wasting your time.

367
00:35:03,776 --> 00:35:05,243
Look...

368
00:35:06,078 --> 00:35:10,606
...what a great blend!
We'll have one kid of each color.

369
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,849
I'll be waiting in the car.

370
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,861
Were you serious?

371
00:35:31,303 --> 00:35:32,964
Never been more.

372
00:35:34,106 --> 00:35:35,801
What the hell is going on, Dalva?

373
00:35:35,975 --> 00:35:37,408
What are you doing there?

374
00:35:40,379 --> 00:35:42,847
Go on, go away, will you?

375
00:35:43,382 --> 00:35:45,748
What?!
Honey, who is this?

376
00:35:45,918 --> 00:35:47,909
- I'm her husband.
- Husband?

377
00:35:48,087 --> 00:35:49,850
Sure. We're marrying.

378
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:52,354
- Come on, Dalva.
- Don't grab me like that!

379
00:35:53,059 --> 00:35:55,289
- Stop it!
- Get out of here, go on!

380
00:35:55,461 --> 00:35:57,190
- Stop it!
- What's this?

381
00:36:01,167 --> 00:36:03,795
See? See that?

382
00:36:03,969 --> 00:36:07,427
If he were in love with you,
he wouldn't have run off!

383
00:36:11,944 --> 00:36:15,641
Jesus! Letting some guy steal his girl!

384
00:36:19,752 --> 00:36:22,915
Tomorrow at 8:00,
get your family together...

385
00:36:23,089 --> 00:36:24,989
...and I'll ask for your hand.

386
00:36:28,213 --> 00:36:32,213
I'd rather my daughter were dead
than marry a thieving nigger.

387
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:36,930
You offend me, sir.
You've only just met me.

388
00:36:36,193 --> 00:36:39,193
I know enough to know you're
nothing but a lazy nigger!

389
00:36:39,206 --> 00:36:41,206
- Look here, sir, I came here...
- Forget it!

390
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,868
You're too old to be
falling for some black man.

391
00:36:45,272 --> 00:36:47,272
Get down there!
Go on!

392
00:36:48,171 --> 00:36:49,171
Easy now!

393
00:36:48,993 --> 00:36:49,993
Down you go.

394
00:36:49,994 --> 00:36:50,994
Come on!

395
00:37:00,252 --> 00:37:02,252
<i>I married her right there.</i>

396
00:37:03,374 --> 00:37:08,053
<i>I took my love with me; my black
fist In hercotton-white hand.</i>

397
00:37:09,314 --> 00:37:11,908
Best thing that could
have happened to me, doctor.

398
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,979
Dalva gave me a family.

399
00:37:14,152 --> 00:37:15,551
So you stopped stealing.

400
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:20,020
Of course not, doctor.
With her by my side, I went upmarket.

401
00:37:20,191 --> 00:37:22,489
Took imported cars and
drove them to Paraguay.

402
00:37:22,661 --> 00:37:26,188
With cash in my pocket,
I returned to the peace of home life.

403
00:37:27,699 --> 00:37:30,065
- Any kids?
- Three with Dalva.

404
00:37:30,669 --> 00:37:32,136
And one with Rosirene.

405
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:35,931
You know how it is: The devil
only tempts those close to God.

406
00:37:36,408 --> 00:37:40,242
That ever happened to you?
Uncontrollable passion?

407
00:38:34,091 --> 00:38:36,491
What's with the babe over there?

408
00:38:45,769 --> 00:38:47,361
What do you think?

409
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:49,203
She's over there.

410
00:38:55,779 --> 00:38:57,644
Don't you dance samba, miss?

411
00:39:00,884 --> 00:39:03,944
What am I, a monkey jumping
around for nothing?

412
00:39:08,625 --> 00:39:11,025
Looking for something to jump to?

413
00:39:12,129 --> 00:39:16,259
Seems like you're the one wanting
to jump. Jump shit.

414
00:39:18,669 --> 00:39:22,400
Look, I'll take my wife home.
Get your bikini...

415
00:39:22,572 --> 00:39:26,099
...and I'll come and fetch you.
We'll spend the weekend at the beach.

416
00:39:27,144 --> 00:39:30,978
- Does she know you belong to me?
- Ease up! I was going to the john.

417
00:39:31,148 --> 00:39:34,447
Like hell you were. And that?
Why is that so hard, then?

418
00:39:34,651 --> 00:39:37,586
Doesn't look like it's being
properly cared for.

419
00:39:39,923 --> 00:39:43,154
- Watch your mouth, you black bitch!
- Wait!

420
00:39:43,326 --> 00:39:45,817
Get away from my man
or you'll be sorry!

421
00:39:45,996 --> 00:39:47,224
You'll be sorry!

422
00:39:49,366 --> 00:39:50,458
Hey, handsome!

423
00:39:51,134 --> 00:39:53,568
So I guess the beach is off, then?

424
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:02,107
So, what happened
to the black girl?

425
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,878
Now, that's where I had to do
a bit of juggling, doctor.

426
00:40:06,049 --> 00:40:09,849
From Monday to Thursday, Dalva.
And the rest, Rosirene.

427
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,955
I rented a little room for us
near the old bus station.

428
00:40:13,123 --> 00:40:15,751
We had this great
love affair going, doctor.

429
00:40:19,496 --> 00:40:20,895
Morning!

430
00:40:28,338 --> 00:40:30,806
- Give me that!
- It's mine!

431
00:40:35,312 --> 00:40:37,678
Stop, you're messing me up!

432
00:40:37,848 --> 00:40:38,872
Stop!

433
00:40:50,527 --> 00:40:52,654
Don't let go of me, Highness.

434
00:40:54,264 --> 00:40:56,892
Don't let go!

435
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,452
You just can't quit this life,
can you?

436
00:41:19,723 --> 00:41:21,623
I told you I'd take care of you.

437
00:41:22,492 --> 00:41:24,585
I've always earned my own money.

438
00:41:26,563 --> 00:41:28,588
And that guy you were with,
know who he is?

439
00:41:28,799 --> 00:41:32,735
What are you doing here?
I thought it was Snow White's day.

440
00:41:32,903 --> 00:41:35,997
Don't change the subject.
You know who he is?

441
00:41:36,339 --> 00:41:38,432
Sure. So what?

442
00:41:39,709 --> 00:41:40,903
So what?

443
00:41:41,711 --> 00:41:44,407
So I told you,
do your thing if you have to...

444
00:41:44,581 --> 00:41:47,948
...but don't screw friends of mine
or I'll break your neck.

445
00:41:48,118 --> 00:41:50,552
Powder's your friend?

446
00:41:50,854 --> 00:41:55,223
Highness, you're a nobody.

447
00:41:55,458 --> 00:42:01,624
He said that when he leaves his wife
we'll move to Miami.

448
00:42:04,167 --> 00:42:05,896
I'm off!

449
00:42:06,069 --> 00:42:07,058
Where to?

450
00:42:09,739 --> 00:42:11,764
To Miami, honey!

451
00:42:12,275 --> 00:42:15,870
- Miami!
- You're taking a souvenir of mine.

452
00:42:17,814 --> 00:42:19,714
No! Get off me!

453
00:42:19,883 --> 00:42:22,113
Highness, get off me!

454
00:42:22,285 --> 00:42:23,718
Get off!

455
00:42:26,323 --> 00:42:30,384
That was rough, screwing a friend
of mine and the two making plans.

456
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,018
That night, I went back to the room.
And what do I see?

457
00:42:37,133 --> 00:42:41,126
Jesus. Get out of here.

458
00:42:42,472 --> 00:42:43,700
No way.

459
00:42:44,708 --> 00:42:46,608
Get out of here right now.

460
00:42:48,845 --> 00:42:50,039
I won't go.

461
00:42:51,581 --> 00:42:52,843
Get out, damn it!

462
00:42:54,284 --> 00:42:56,775
No way, I'm staying.

463
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:00,451
Come on, Highness, bite me.

464
00:43:01,324 --> 00:43:02,416
Come on...

465
00:43:03,326 --> 00:43:04,657
...bite me...

466
00:43:05,629 --> 00:43:07,722
...bite me the way I like it.

467
00:43:11,334 --> 00:43:12,858
Bite!

468
00:43:13,036 --> 00:43:14,867
Bite, go on, bite!

469
00:43:15,038 --> 00:43:17,131
Bite harder...

470
00:43:17,307 --> 00:43:19,138
...harder!

471
00:43:20,844 --> 00:43:22,141
Harder!

472
00:43:22,345 --> 00:43:24,370
Bite harder!

473
00:43:52,976 --> 00:43:54,238
It's over!

474
00:43:57,514 --> 00:43:58,503
Damn it!

475
00:43:58,682 --> 00:44:01,412
There, that's so you learn
not to take what's not yours.

476
00:44:01,584 --> 00:44:03,449
You arsonist bitch!

477
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:04,882
Slut!

478
00:44:05,055 --> 00:44:08,718
Well, you might as well know that
this slut is expecting his child.

479
00:44:08,892 --> 00:44:10,154
No!

480
00:44:12,062 --> 00:44:14,496
Son of a bitch whore!

481
00:44:14,664 --> 00:44:15,995
I'll kill you!

482
00:44:17,167 --> 00:44:18,657
You son of a bitch whore!

483
00:44:18,835 --> 00:44:21,030
You haven't heard
the last of this, Highness!

484
00:44:21,204 --> 00:44:23,764
- You haven't heard the last of this!
- Son of a bitch!

485
00:44:28,111 --> 00:44:29,942
Come here! Come here!

486
00:44:30,113 --> 00:44:31,603
Get your hands off my son!

487
00:44:31,781 --> 00:44:35,512
To keep Dalva out of trouble,
I took the blame for the fire.

488
00:44:36,186 --> 00:44:38,711
Only, the law was already
on my back for other stuff...

489
00:44:39,656 --> 00:44:42,386
...so I got 16 years for the fire...

490
00:44:42,625 --> 00:44:44,593
...reduced to 10.

491
00:44:44,761 --> 00:44:49,357
- And was it worth it?
- The black chick put a spell on me.

492
00:44:50,567 --> 00:44:52,034
I'm out of here!

493
00:44:53,269 --> 00:44:57,035
Therefore, perfectly calmly,
we shall overcome the niggling...

494
00:44:57,207 --> 00:45:02,406
...irresponsible and lying attempts
to involve the government...

495
00:45:17,093 --> 00:45:18,117
So, what's up?

496
00:45:28,471 --> 00:45:29,768
Letter from Franci?

497
00:45:35,812 --> 00:45:38,838
Your sister mention me at all?

498
00:45:40,483 --> 00:45:41,677
Of course she does, right?

499
00:45:49,025 --> 00:45:52,085
Hey, Deusdete! What does
your sister say about me?

500
00:45:53,563 --> 00:45:55,224
She asks if you're okay.

501
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,794
That's all?

502
00:46:00,837 --> 00:46:02,236
What do you think?

503
00:46:03,139 --> 00:46:06,666
If she knew what you've been up to,
she wouldn't even be asking that.

504
00:46:08,545 --> 00:46:10,274
I think she would...

505
00:46:11,481 --> 00:46:13,472
...but you think you know better.

506
00:46:14,818 --> 00:46:18,185
Wasn't it you who used to say,
"If you sell it, don't use it"?

507
00:46:18,421 --> 00:46:19,581
Wasn't it you?

508
00:46:22,492 --> 00:46:23,720
May I?

509
00:46:23,993 --> 00:46:25,221
So, what's up?

510
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:29,061
Come to settle your debt?

511
00:46:29,399 --> 00:46:32,994
Hey, man, right now Ezequiel's
in a tight spot.

512
00:46:33,336 --> 00:46:36,237
So he thinks to himself,
"Zico's a reasonable guy.

513
00:46:36,539 --> 00:46:39,303
He'll take the surfboard
as collateral for the debt."

514
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:43,877
Then Ezequiel can have another
little rock of crack, right, man?

515
00:46:45,081 --> 00:46:46,514
Wrong.

516
00:46:53,923 --> 00:46:56,187
Pay what you owe!

517
00:47:01,498 --> 00:47:03,591
Don't drink that, it's blood!

518
00:47:06,636 --> 00:47:07,830
Shit!

519
00:47:09,339 --> 00:47:11,068
I thought it was water.

520
00:47:11,241 --> 00:47:15,302
Doctor, this guy was
sweating all night long.

521
00:47:15,478 --> 00:47:18,276
I've put him on antibiotics,
but if you ask me, it's no use.

522
00:47:18,448 --> 00:47:19,574
It's AIDS.

523
00:47:22,785 --> 00:47:24,150
Doctor!

524
00:47:26,022 --> 00:47:27,887
Who took away his oxygen?

525
00:47:30,793 --> 00:47:32,488
I don't want to die.

526
00:47:33,329 --> 00:47:37,026
Get me out of here, please!

527
00:47:38,668 --> 00:47:42,832
That's hardly likely.
He's 213. Rape.

528
00:47:43,506 --> 00:47:45,531
To us he's a patient.

529
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:52,443
I can't...

530
00:47:52,615 --> 00:47:54,446
I need...

531
00:47:54,617 --> 00:47:56,608
...to get somewhere safe.

532
00:47:57,086 --> 00:47:59,987
- I don't want to die!
- I'm sorry, doctor.

533
00:48:00,156 --> 00:48:04,820
I'm against the death penalty,
but not for rape.

534
00:48:04,994 --> 00:48:07,189
If you ask me, it's just too bad.

535
00:48:14,237 --> 00:48:15,465
So that's it, doctor.

536
00:48:55,078 --> 00:48:57,706
Come on, old man. It's past lockdown.

537
00:49:19,702 --> 00:49:21,192
Get a move on!

538
00:49:28,945 --> 00:49:31,140
What is it? What are you looking at?

539
00:49:32,382 --> 00:49:35,317
You think your kids
will jump over the wall?

540
00:49:57,650 --> 00:49:59,743
You were asking for it this time,
weren't you?

541
00:50:05,725 --> 00:50:07,750
See you in 30 days.

542
00:50:16,602 --> 00:50:20,163
Doctor, we're here to make
our relationship official.

543
00:50:20,339 --> 00:50:22,398
With all due respect.

544
00:50:22,575 --> 00:50:26,944
You understand, doctor.
So we can be more open.

545
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,578
It's not the same with a rubber.

546
00:50:30,183 --> 00:50:33,710
There's not much sense,
her taking the test and not you.

547
00:50:34,053 --> 00:50:37,648
See? I told him, doctor,
but he's scared.

548
00:50:38,157 --> 00:50:39,454
Scared of what?

549
00:50:40,426 --> 00:50:43,156
- Scared of injections.
- Too Bad!

550
00:50:43,429 --> 00:50:46,421
- It's not that.
- So you're scared of getting married!

551
00:50:46,799 --> 00:50:47,166
Doctor, you're needed, urgently!

552
00:50:47,166 --> 00:50:49,396
Doctor, you're needed, urgently!

553
00:50:49,569 --> 00:50:50,558
Come on!

554
00:50:50,736 --> 00:50:52,601
Down you go, come on!

555
00:50:53,372 --> 00:50:54,896
It's all right now, doctor.

556
00:50:57,410 --> 00:50:58,934
I blacked out, doctor.

557
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:02,577
Giving us all a fright, Zico?

558
00:51:04,016 --> 00:51:07,383
It's just as well, doctor.
Maybe he'll learn what drugs do.

559
00:51:07,653 --> 00:51:08,813
Tell him!

560
00:51:09,055 --> 00:51:11,580
What's there to tell? Drugs kill.

561
00:51:12,692 --> 00:51:14,887
- And you, who are you?
- That's Deusdete.

562
00:51:15,928 --> 00:51:17,919
We grew up together.

563
00:51:19,966 --> 00:51:21,365
You know, doctor...

564
00:51:22,001 --> 00:51:24,265
...one day my mother
didn't come home.

565
00:51:24,737 --> 00:51:26,170
I was left alone.

566
00:51:26,706 --> 00:51:27,764
I waited...

567
00:51:28,674 --> 00:51:29,936
...and waited...

568
00:51:31,878 --> 00:51:37,111
...until he and his sister, Franci,
came and took me to live with them.

569
00:51:47,426 --> 00:51:48,859
We grew up together.

570
00:51:51,898 --> 00:51:54,560
Wait!

571
00:52:16,522 --> 00:52:17,853
Come on, Zico!

572
00:52:33,005 --> 00:52:34,905
Wait, Zico!

573
00:53:01,934 --> 00:53:03,424
Zico!

574
00:53:06,939 --> 00:53:08,065
Help!

575
00:53:41,774 --> 00:53:43,537
Zico saved me, doctor.

576
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:49,076
That's right. I've always
looked after him, from early on.

577
00:53:50,583 --> 00:53:53,416
Then you went the wrong way.

578
00:53:57,390 --> 00:54:02,828
What's wrong with buying some dope
and selling it to folks who like it?

579
00:54:03,896 --> 00:54:06,865
It wasn't even that much!
Another two years and I'm free.

580
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:09,825
But I've never killed anyone.

581
00:54:11,137 --> 00:54:12,866
Unlike Deusdete here.

582
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:15,568
What was your crime?

583
00:54:16,108 --> 00:54:17,769
Answer him, Deusdete!

584
00:54:23,149 --> 00:54:26,949
To tell you the truth,
he's not even a real criminal.

585
00:54:29,088 --> 00:54:31,113
So, what are you in here for?

586
00:54:32,958 --> 00:54:36,223
One night, I was at home...

587
00:54:37,196 --> 00:54:39,221
...when my sister arrived,
acting strange.

588
00:54:40,333 --> 00:54:41,630
Franci!

589
00:54:42,068 --> 00:54:44,969
What's wrong, Franci?
What happened?

590
00:54:45,171 --> 00:54:46,604
Franci!

591
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,441
Franci, what happened?

592
00:54:58,250 --> 00:54:59,512
Open up, come on.

593
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:02,053
What happened?

594
00:55:09,829 --> 00:55:11,387
What happened, Franci?

595
00:55:15,234 --> 00:55:17,464
What happened? Tell me.

596
00:55:18,471 --> 00:55:20,598
What happened?

597
00:55:23,576 --> 00:55:24,770
Tell me!

598
00:55:25,845 --> 00:55:27,642
There were two of them...

599
00:55:29,949 --> 00:55:31,382
...they grabbed me...

600
00:55:33,486 --> 00:55:35,317
...lifted my skirt.

601
00:55:38,290 --> 00:55:40,383
One said he wanted to suck me.

602
00:55:41,127 --> 00:55:44,494
- I told him to go suck his mother!
- What did they do to you?

603
00:55:44,663 --> 00:55:46,392
- They beat me.
- What else?

604
00:55:48,334 --> 00:55:49,392
What else?

605
00:55:49,568 --> 00:55:51,365
- That's all, Deusdete.
- Who was it?

606
00:55:51,537 --> 00:55:52,526
Who was it?

607
00:55:52,705 --> 00:55:55,469
- I just ran off!
- Did you know them?

608
00:56:04,383 --> 00:56:05,475
Hey, Zico!

609
00:56:08,988 --> 00:56:10,387
Deusdete?

610
00:56:10,656 --> 00:56:12,783
What are you doing here, man?

611
00:56:13,392 --> 00:56:14,859
I need to talk.

612
00:56:30,643 --> 00:56:32,235
Is Mother all right?

613
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:34,411
It's not her.

614
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,911
Some guys messed with Franci.

615
00:56:48,794 --> 00:56:50,261
What did they do to her?

616
00:56:51,163 --> 00:56:54,929
Nothing much, she says.
But I reported it to the cops anyway.

617
00:56:55,234 --> 00:56:59,068
The cops?! You think the cops
will do anything?!

618
00:56:59,238 --> 00:57:02,401
The problem is, the guys found out
and now they're after me.

619
00:57:06,479 --> 00:57:10,438
- Leave it to me. I'll sort them out.
- No, Zico. Not your way.

620
00:57:11,016 --> 00:57:12,210
I want...

621
00:57:16,222 --> 00:57:18,952
I just want a gun, to defend myself.

622
00:57:29,468 --> 00:57:30,867
Take your pick.

623
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:47,976
Even with a gun, doctor, I never
thought anything would happen.

624
00:57:50,422 --> 00:57:56,258
But it was my destiny,
and theirs, when they found me.

625
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:05,759
So!

626
00:58:06,772 --> 00:58:09,832
- Where's the stool pigeon off to?
- I'm not looking for a fight.

627
00:58:10,009 --> 00:58:12,876
- Let me go home.
- Sure thing...

628
00:58:13,145 --> 00:58:15,705
...but first we're going to caress you...

629
00:58:15,881 --> 00:58:18,179
...just like we did your little sister.

630
00:59:56,382 --> 00:59:57,610
Hey, man!

631
01:00:31,583 --> 01:00:33,244
Give me a Coke.

632
01:00:39,091 --> 01:00:41,685
You know how old I'll be
when I get out of here, doctor?

633
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:46,420
Forty-eight.

634
01:00:48,233 --> 01:00:49,825
There!

635
01:00:55,607 --> 01:00:56,869
One...

636
01:00:58,010 --> 01:00:59,375
...two...

637
01:01:00,913 --> 01:01:02,073
...three...

638
01:01:03,382 --> 01:01:04,644
...four...

639
01:01:05,851 --> 01:01:07,341
...five...

640
01:01:08,087 --> 01:01:09,384
...six...

641
01:01:10,456 --> 01:01:11,821
...seven...

642
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:16,459
...eight.

643
01:01:23,535 --> 01:01:25,093
Found it.

644
01:01:39,294 --> 01:01:40,886
So it's Visitors Day, is it?

645
01:01:42,497 --> 01:01:43,794
If you like...

646
01:01:44,165 --> 01:01:45,598
...you can go now.

647
01:01:58,847 --> 01:02:01,441
I've got a problem, I need to talk.

648
01:02:02,684 --> 01:02:04,515
This problem got a name?

649
01:02:05,053 --> 01:02:06,315
Ezequiel.

650
01:02:06,788 --> 01:02:09,814
He still owes me and now he's
trying to get more on account.

651
01:02:10,959 --> 01:02:14,417
He comes to my cell, raises his voice.
What's he playing at?

652
01:02:14,929 --> 01:02:16,920
- And you?
- Me?

653
01:02:17,699 --> 01:02:20,395
If I don't get paid,
I can't pay Highness.

654
01:02:21,503 --> 01:02:24,063
I want your permission
to kill the bastard.

655
01:02:24,405 --> 01:02:27,863
This goes on much longer,
I'll start losing respect around here.

656
01:02:28,042 --> 01:02:29,532
Cool it.

657
01:02:30,945 --> 01:02:34,437
I'll tell Ezequiel to get
the money from his family.

658
01:02:35,049 --> 01:02:38,985
If he doesn't pay,
you can go ahead.

659
01:02:49,330 --> 01:02:51,628
This man has already lost a lung...

660
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:55,930
...and the other's in pretty bad shape.
- Take the medicine, man, go on.

661
01:02:57,772 --> 01:03:00,036
See, doctor? He won't take it.

662
01:03:01,309 --> 01:03:03,277
What are you, a kid?
You won't get better...

663
01:03:03,444 --> 01:03:06,845
...if you don't take it.
- Come on, that's right.

664
01:03:08,483 --> 01:03:09,507
That's it.

665
01:03:14,889 --> 01:03:15,878
Come on.

666
01:03:17,559 --> 01:03:18,617
Right.

667
01:03:23,097 --> 01:03:26,294
- Good.
- And on the outside? What did he do?

668
01:03:26,601 --> 01:03:28,831
We used to rob armored trucks.

669
01:03:29,003 --> 01:03:33,201
Just the two of us.
We planned everything. Remember?

670
01:03:33,474 --> 01:03:36,602
Doctor, we'd spend six months
just gathering information.

671
01:03:36,778 --> 01:03:39,144
We'd even make friends
with the guards' families.

672
01:03:39,314 --> 01:03:40,781
And that paid off?

673
01:03:41,115 --> 01:03:45,074
Sure, plenty. Although
we'd only use half the money.

674
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:49,586
The rest we'd put aside
for a rainy day...

675
01:03:49,824 --> 01:03:51,917
...or to bribe the cops.

676
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:06,800
It's coming.

677
01:04:38,039 --> 01:04:39,472
Stop!

678
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:45,038
You going to sit there
on top of other people's money?

679
01:04:45,213 --> 01:04:47,841
If you don't come out it'll be
too bad for your widows.

680
01:04:48,016 --> 01:04:49,745
Open that door,
for Christ's sake!

681
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,678
Come on, get out!

682
01:04:53,922 --> 01:04:56,356
So we paid off the others...

683
01:04:56,524 --> 01:04:59,516
...and each went his own way
back to the family.

684
01:05:01,763 --> 01:05:04,197
So anyway, Antônio,
what's on your mind?

685
01:05:07,535 --> 01:05:08,763
Miro...

686
01:05:10,305 --> 01:05:12,398
...your wife's cheating on you.

687
01:05:13,775 --> 01:05:15,242
With a cop.

688
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:21,772
- Says who?
- Says no one. I saw her.

689
01:05:22,083 --> 01:05:25,280
They were making out in a squad car.

690
01:05:26,421 --> 01:05:28,389
Near the old bakery.

691
01:05:38,299 --> 01:05:40,130
Dina doesn't buy bread there.

692
01:05:40,301 --> 01:05:43,668
Miro, I saw her.
And it wasn't bread she was after.

693
01:05:52,125 --> 01:05:53,387
Célia...

694
01:05:54,961 --> 01:05:57,020
...is Antônio Carlos gay?

695
01:05:58,432 --> 01:06:00,297
What a question, Dina!

696
01:06:03,103 --> 01:06:07,972
He made up this story and told Miro
I've been going out with a cop.

697
01:06:08,141 --> 01:06:12,373
Like hell I made it up.
I saw you crawling all over him.

698
01:06:12,546 --> 01:06:17,245
- You nibbled his ear, damn it!
- Then it's me he's really after.

699
01:06:18,018 --> 01:06:20,714
You forgot the best part...

700
01:06:20,987 --> 01:06:24,286
...how you asked me to run away
with you...

701
01:06:24,458 --> 01:06:26,016
...and that I turned you down...

702
01:06:26,193 --> 01:06:28,024
...because I love my husband...

703
01:06:28,362 --> 01:06:30,193
...and your wife's my friend.

704
01:06:31,264 --> 01:06:32,731
Liar!

705
01:06:32,999 --> 01:06:34,660
Evil slut!

706
01:06:42,669 --> 01:06:47,129
Miro, you don't believe that bitch,
do you?

707
01:06:49,343 --> 01:06:53,074
Man, how many jobs have we
pulled off together?

708
01:06:54,448 --> 01:06:56,848
And our agreement!

709
01:06:57,017 --> 01:07:00,453
Célia, see if you can keep your man
around the house.

710
01:07:00,621 --> 01:07:03,351
I don't want him pestering me
in the street anymore.

711
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:08,122
Miro!

712
01:07:13,267 --> 01:07:15,667
- Miro!
- Bastard! You dirty bastard!

713
01:07:16,003 --> 01:07:17,368
You've never fooled me.

714
01:07:17,537 --> 01:07:20,097
I always knew you had a crush on her.

715
01:07:20,274 --> 01:07:23,471
You can't even respect your
best friend's wife, you dog!

716
01:07:23,644 --> 01:07:25,544
- Calm down.
- Dog!

717
01:07:30,150 --> 01:07:33,415
Miro, I'm telling you the truth!

718
01:07:41,295 --> 01:07:43,229
I lost my friend and partner.

719
01:07:43,597 --> 01:07:46,896
The first robbery without him,
there were so many cops...

720
01:07:47,067 --> 01:07:49,399
...it looked more like a military parade.

721
01:07:49,703 --> 01:07:52,934
- What about him?
- I only found out when he got here.

722
01:07:53,307 --> 01:07:55,935
I thought I'd gone to hell, doctor.

723
01:07:56,109 --> 01:07:57,701
But him? I'll tell you.

724
01:07:58,178 --> 01:07:59,668
Come here, come on.

725
01:08:00,013 --> 01:08:01,480
Come on.

726
01:08:19,232 --> 01:08:20,221
Miro.

727
01:08:21,368 --> 01:08:23,529
Miro, don't you think it's time you quit?

728
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:29,572
Take what you've got and start
a decent life someplace else?

729
01:08:29,743 --> 01:08:31,210
In a new city?

730
01:08:31,545 --> 01:08:35,276
Give the kid a better chance?

731
01:09:02,242 --> 01:09:03,709
Stop! Police!

732
01:09:05,445 --> 01:09:07,276
Party's over, Miro.

733
01:09:08,382 --> 01:09:10,009
I'll cut you in.

734
01:09:10,384 --> 01:09:14,684
It's cheaper for me to cut you guys in
than give it to a lawyer.

735
01:09:14,855 --> 01:09:16,083
You don't get it.

736
01:09:16,256 --> 01:09:18,690
We're taking the lot. Everything.

737
01:09:18,859 --> 01:09:20,724
Hand it over, the dough.
Come on, quick.

738
01:09:34,041 --> 01:09:38,205
Too bad, a smart guy like you
trusting his own wife.

739
01:09:38,879 --> 01:09:41,404
Some guys are born
to be cheated on.

740
01:09:57,998 --> 01:09:59,329
Are you all right?

741
01:10:21,689 --> 01:10:22,986
Doctor...

742
01:10:25,025 --> 01:10:31,362
...do infants remember
everything we do?

743
01:10:33,067 --> 01:10:36,093
No, not a thing.

744
01:10:38,339 --> 01:10:41,240
Doctor, let him go.

745
01:11:11,472 --> 01:11:13,099
And with you now...

746
01:11:13,274 --> 01:11:16,641
...our untamed diva of dance...

747
01:11:16,911 --> 01:11:20,142
...the woman who lives in all
thieves' hearts...

748
01:11:20,314 --> 01:11:25,274
...here at the detention center...

749
01:11:25,452 --> 01:11:30,822
...the one and only Rita Cadillac!

750
01:11:33,294 --> 01:11:35,762
- Rita!
- Rita!

751
01:12:23,577 --> 01:12:24,669
Hello!

752
01:12:25,646 --> 01:12:27,910
I know you all...

753
01:12:28,449 --> 01:12:32,180
...fool around a lot, right?

754
01:12:32,486 --> 01:12:33,976
Yes!

755
01:12:34,989 --> 01:12:37,549
But do you take care
of yourselves?

756
01:12:37,925 --> 01:12:39,256
Yes!

757
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:44,120
Our friend, the doctor,
came here today...

758
01:12:44,298 --> 01:12:47,734
...and he's taught me enough
to teach you too, right?

759
01:12:47,902 --> 01:12:49,199
That's right!

760
01:12:49,503 --> 01:12:53,837
Okay, so some of you are
careful and some forget...

761
01:12:54,008 --> 01:12:57,500
...so I'm going to teach you what to do.

762
01:13:09,256 --> 01:13:11,417
This one's orange!

763
01:14:23,697 --> 01:14:27,224
- Dona Graça, Ebony sent you this.
- Thanks.

764
01:14:29,670 --> 01:14:34,039
- Oh, look. My man. Want some?
- No, thank you.

765
01:14:34,475 --> 01:14:37,308
See, Franci?
That's the sort of man I want.

766
01:14:37,644 --> 01:14:41,410
- You think Deusdete will like me?
- That's up to the two of you.

767
01:14:41,582 --> 01:14:44,881
It's easier for him if he has a
sweetheart waiting on the outside.

768
01:14:45,052 --> 01:14:46,144
You're right.

769
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:49,448
You need a heart full of love
to put up with this life.

770
01:14:49,623 --> 01:14:53,354
Take my boy. He's always
asking about his father.

771
01:14:53,994 --> 01:14:56,588
What did he say when
you told him I was coming?

772
01:14:56,764 --> 01:14:59,232
That you could come,
if you felt like it.

773
01:15:14,148 --> 01:15:15,479
Good work, man.

774
01:16:17,811 --> 01:16:23,511
Agenor Barbosa, inmate 15027.
Your brothers Pedro...

775
01:16:23,684 --> 01:16:27,711
...Luiz and Felício are waiting
for you at the barbershop.

776
01:16:27,888 --> 01:16:31,324
- Deusdete, this is Catarina.
- Hello.

777
01:16:31,492 --> 01:16:32,891
This is me.

778
01:16:34,328 --> 01:16:36,353
Franci's told me a lot about you.

779
01:16:37,097 --> 01:16:38,325
Nothing bad, I hope.

780
01:16:38,599 --> 01:16:40,157
Only the best.

781
01:16:40,334 --> 01:16:44,293
She was even a bit jealous when
I said I wanted to meet you, right?

782
01:16:50,444 --> 01:16:51,604
Zico.

783
01:16:53,413 --> 01:16:54,607
Hi, Franci.

784
01:16:59,119 --> 01:17:01,212
You're so thin.

785
01:17:01,688 --> 01:17:04,486
- Been eating too much junk?
- Sure thing.

786
01:17:04,925 --> 01:17:07,450
But that's the least of it, right, Zico?

787
01:17:10,197 --> 01:17:12,791
Son, have you been taking
good care of your brother?

788
01:17:14,935 --> 01:17:16,368
You bet, Godmother.

789
01:17:17,237 --> 01:17:18,636
The game's starting...

790
01:17:18,805 --> 01:17:21,865
...the referee blows the whistle
and they're off!

791
01:17:22,042 --> 01:17:24,738
There goes Neto, and he's through...

792
01:17:24,912 --> 01:17:27,847
...to the penalty area, playing
beautifully, passing one player...

793
01:17:28,015 --> 01:17:30,779
...slowly, beautifully,
there he goes...

794
01:17:30,951 --> 01:17:34,546
...dribbling that ball.
And Highness takes a shot!

795
01:17:34,721 --> 01:17:40,284
Inmate Josué "Highness" dos Santos,
section 9302...

796
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:43,657
...come immediately to the entrance
of Pavilion 9.

797
01:17:53,907 --> 01:17:55,135
Darling...

798
01:17:57,010 --> 01:17:59,171
...l'll be right back.

799
01:18:24,271 --> 01:18:25,704
Hi, honey!

800
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:31,940
Kiss me on the mouth!

801
01:18:37,017 --> 01:18:38,041
Come on.

802
01:18:38,218 --> 01:18:43,053
Oh, honey, today is not a good day.

803
01:18:43,223 --> 01:18:48,126
You haven't worked a day in your life,
now you tell me you've changed?

804
01:18:48,295 --> 01:18:51,787
- You have to understand...
- You've got that white trash in there.

805
01:18:51,965 --> 01:18:55,457
- No way, I swear!
- Really? So let's go and take a look.

806
01:18:55,636 --> 01:18:58,434
Because I think that white slut
is in there with you!

807
01:18:58,605 --> 01:19:01,199
- Cut it out, honey.
- I'll show you!

808
01:19:10,784 --> 01:19:15,153
Do you think I'm stupid, an idiot?
I know she's in there!

809
01:19:15,322 --> 01:19:17,517
What are you looking at?

810
01:19:21,528 --> 01:19:22,586
There!

811
01:19:22,763 --> 01:19:25,755
I just knew you were with that whore.

812
01:19:26,166 --> 01:19:28,031
Oh, so now I'm the whore, am I?

813
01:19:28,201 --> 01:19:30,692
- Listen!
- Stop, stop!

814
01:19:32,005 --> 01:19:33,597
Let's all sit down.

815
01:19:34,041 --> 01:19:35,406
Sit down, Dalva.

816
01:19:35,809 --> 01:19:37,367
Sit down, please.

817
01:19:38,745 --> 01:19:40,804
Rosirene, sit down.

818
01:19:41,515 --> 01:19:43,949
Rosirene, sit down.

819
01:19:50,657 --> 01:19:54,286
Right, now you're here,
there's no turning back.

820
01:19:54,661 --> 01:19:57,630
The three of us are going
to come to an agreement.

821
01:19:57,964 --> 01:20:01,195
Rosirene, Dalva's no whore, all right?

822
01:20:01,368 --> 01:20:05,304
She works at the textile factory
and raises our kids.

823
01:20:05,472 --> 01:20:07,599
They're my kids, damn it!

824
01:20:12,546 --> 01:20:17,006
And you too. You said Rosirene's
worthless, and that's not true either.

825
01:20:17,184 --> 01:20:21,553
If it weren't for her bringing me
some decent stuff to sell in here...

826
01:20:21,722 --> 01:20:25,351
...we'd all be going hungry.

827
01:20:27,994 --> 01:20:29,962
If you like both of us...

828
01:20:30,497 --> 01:20:32,988
...that's your problem.
- Oh, Jesus!

829
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:39,361
Yeah, Highness. You're going to have
to choose between us right now.

830
01:20:41,475 --> 01:20:43,136
Damn right.

831
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:54,118
Shit. You're breaking my heart
in two, damn it!

832
01:21:03,330 --> 01:21:04,820
Two women, doctor!

833
01:21:05,298 --> 01:21:08,028
What do these crooks have
that we haven't?

834
01:21:08,735 --> 01:21:13,138
- Have you kissed your wife today?
- No, why?

835
01:21:14,641 --> 01:21:16,131
I rest my case.

836
01:21:29,156 --> 01:21:30,953
Can I join you?

837
01:21:42,436 --> 01:21:45,200
So. Nothing to tell?

838
01:21:46,606 --> 01:21:49,507
You're the one who never told us
what happened that day.

839
01:21:50,277 --> 01:21:51,904
That's ancient history, Zico.

840
01:21:54,047 --> 01:21:56,538
You never told me
what they did to you.

841
01:22:13,867 --> 01:22:17,963
When you get out of here,
promise me you'll let your hair grow?

842
01:22:22,709 --> 01:22:24,700
You believe in promises?

843
01:22:30,083 --> 01:22:32,574
Deusdete was right...

844
01:22:33,086 --> 01:22:35,554
...you're not the Zico we used to know.

845
01:23:05,685 --> 01:23:06,913
Anyone home?

846
01:23:08,755 --> 01:23:11,246
What's up, Dagger?

847
01:23:14,494 --> 01:23:16,724
I've got a message for a friend.

848
01:23:17,097 --> 01:23:18,257
I know.

849
01:24:12,619 --> 01:24:14,519
What's that look on your face?

850
01:24:15,822 --> 01:24:19,314
I pretended I had AIDS
so they'd leave me alone...

851
01:24:19,693 --> 01:24:21,490
...but it was no use.

852
01:24:21,995 --> 01:24:24,964
The bastard who did me is infected.

853
01:24:25,265 --> 01:24:29,167
Forget it, kid. He told me
to tell you he lied too.

854
01:24:29,536 --> 01:24:31,504
He hasn't got AIDS either.

855
01:24:38,211 --> 01:24:39,200
What is it?

856
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:41,476
Ezequiel wants to pay.

857
01:24:41,915 --> 01:24:43,746
You don't owe me anything, man.

858
01:24:45,285 --> 01:24:48,186
Ezequiel spoke to her
and she said yes.

859
01:24:52,125 --> 01:24:53,456
I don't get it.

860
01:24:53,893 --> 01:24:56,225
Ezequiel wants to pay with her.

861
01:24:56,496 --> 01:24:58,623
Ezequiel's sister sleeps
with some of the guys...

862
01:24:58,798 --> 01:25:00,925
...raises some cash
and pays the debt with Zico.

863
01:25:03,503 --> 01:25:05,869
Ezequiel has no other possessions.

864
01:25:11,344 --> 01:25:13,676
Do whatever you think is best.

865
01:25:22,389 --> 01:25:23,822
I was blind.

866
01:25:24,324 --> 01:25:26,485
I was blind, I believed her.

867
01:25:28,695 --> 01:25:30,162
Will you ever...

868
01:25:31,431 --> 01:25:33,490
...be able to trust me again?

869
01:25:35,702 --> 01:25:37,533
I never stopped trusting you.

870
01:25:45,879 --> 01:25:48,074
He's our family now.

871
01:25:54,688 --> 01:25:56,986
- Let's sing "Happy Birthday"!
- Shall we?

872
01:25:57,223 --> 01:25:58,781
Here, sit on my lap.

873
01:25:58,958 --> 01:26:01,449
One, two, three.

874
01:26:01,628 --> 01:26:06,224
Happy birthday to you

875
01:26:06,399 --> 01:26:11,393
Happy birthday to you

876
01:26:12,338 --> 01:26:15,171
Sir, we're in love.

877
01:26:15,742 --> 01:26:18,870
Lady and I would like your blessing.

878
01:26:19,279 --> 01:26:20,712
It's Dirceu.

879
01:26:20,980 --> 01:26:22,971
His name is Dirceu.

880
01:26:26,319 --> 01:26:29,720
Son, do you believe in him?

881
01:26:31,958 --> 01:26:35,291
Mother, I've never met anyone
like Matias.

882
01:26:37,030 --> 01:26:39,362
I don't get this kid.

883
01:26:46,206 --> 01:26:49,505
We're too old to know what's right,
Antônio.

884
01:26:50,343 --> 01:26:54,040
If it's what Dirceu wants,
what's the harm?

885
01:26:55,115 --> 01:26:58,744
In here they can get up to all
the disgusting things they live.

886
01:27:05,425 --> 01:27:06,824
Son.

887
01:27:10,563 --> 01:27:11,791
Goodbye.

888
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:17,831
Your attention, please.
Visitors Day is almost over...

889
01:27:18,271 --> 01:27:21,672
...so will family members please
go to the exit.

890
01:27:21,841 --> 01:27:24,708
The gates will close in 10 minutes.

891
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:29,170
Excuse me, doctor.

892
01:27:29,616 --> 01:27:31,015
This is my boy.

893
01:27:31,551 --> 01:27:35,453
I know he's done wrong,
but when I think of him...

894
01:27:35,622 --> 01:27:38,557
...I can't believe he took
someone's life.

895
01:27:38,725 --> 01:27:41,489
I wanted to ask you to keep
an eye on Davilson for me.

896
01:27:41,661 --> 01:27:44,255
I can't look after him in here.

897
01:27:44,864 --> 01:27:47,958
- Come and see me at the infirmary.
- Yes, sir.

898
01:27:48,134 --> 01:27:50,159
Thank you, doctor.

899
01:28:24,604 --> 01:28:27,471
So can I come back next time?

900
01:28:29,008 --> 01:28:30,976
If you think it's worth it.

901
01:28:31,811 --> 01:28:34,041
It'll be so long before I get out.

902
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:42,820
I'm in no hurry.

903
01:28:56,236 --> 01:29:00,104
Mr. Pires, his body was already
hanging here when we woke up.

904
01:29:08,848 --> 01:29:11,442
This one won't be raping anyone else.

905
01:29:28,801 --> 01:29:31,531
The doctor said it
should read positive.

906
01:29:31,704 --> 01:29:35,003
No! Positive means you've
got it in your blood.

907
01:29:35,742 --> 01:29:37,437
It has to be negative.

908
01:29:39,779 --> 01:29:41,440
HIV-negative.

909
01:29:46,486 --> 01:29:47,953
I'll go first.

910
01:29:48,121 --> 01:29:49,554
My case is more desperate.

911
01:30:02,302 --> 01:30:03,701
I'm clean!

912
01:30:06,873 --> 01:30:08,238
I'm clean!

913
01:30:19,552 --> 01:30:23,386
Well, you've had your fun.

914
01:30:23,556 --> 01:30:26,491
You've had over 2000 men
and you're clean.

915
01:30:26,993 --> 01:30:30,793
And me, as square as they come?
It's just too bad.

916
01:30:38,104 --> 01:30:40,197
I'm clean too, Lady.

917
01:30:51,684 --> 01:30:53,049
What's wrong?

918
01:31:04,964 --> 01:31:07,455
They're letting me out, Lady.

919
01:31:15,508 --> 01:31:17,100
So why aren't you happy?

920
01:31:18,745 --> 01:31:20,212
And leave you here?

921
01:31:20,847 --> 01:31:21,939
All alone?

922
01:31:24,484 --> 01:31:25,712
I'm not alone.

923
01:31:37,897 --> 01:31:39,694
I have you.

924
01:31:55,248 --> 01:31:58,479
No one works for me
who can't be trusted.

925
01:31:58,651 --> 01:32:01,142
You ask permission to kill,
then change your mind?

926
01:32:01,387 --> 01:32:04,879
But Ebony, I'll be out in two years.

927
01:32:05,058 --> 01:32:09,119
Better keep quiet and settle the score
on the outside, right?

928
01:32:09,395 --> 01:32:10,885
Ezequiel...

929
01:32:11,964 --> 01:32:13,829
...you owed and didn't pay.

930
01:32:14,967 --> 01:32:17,492
You're alive, but you can't stay here.

931
01:32:18,171 --> 01:32:20,935
Get your things and go
to the yellow wing.

932
01:32:23,643 --> 01:32:27,545
As for you, Zico, you're no criminal.

933
01:32:28,081 --> 01:32:29,776
You're a clown.

934
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:15,787
It's all right, doctor.

935
01:33:16,362 --> 01:33:17,852
So many years locked up...

936
01:33:18,331 --> 01:33:21,994
...the mind learns to control the body.

937
01:33:41,854 --> 01:33:43,947
Chico, how come you're in here?

938
01:33:44,557 --> 01:33:46,889
Oh, doctor, you want to hear
yet another lie?

939
01:33:47,426 --> 01:33:50,884
No one in here is really guilty,
haven't you noticed?

940
01:33:52,431 --> 01:33:56,663
- Much longer to go?
- I should have been out long ago.

941
01:33:56,836 --> 01:34:00,966
It's in the hands of the judge.
Oh, doctor, I can't wait.

942
01:34:01,140 --> 01:34:03,802
Best thing about jail is getting out.

943
01:34:03,976 --> 01:34:05,534
And leave behind all your friends?

944
01:34:05,711 --> 01:34:08,305
Friends?
I don't want inmates for friends.

945
01:34:08,481 --> 01:34:12,178
I finish talking to you,
close the door and that's that.

946
01:34:12,351 --> 01:34:15,149
In here you have to walk alone...

947
01:34:15,321 --> 01:34:18,415
...or maybe with God.

948
01:34:20,259 --> 01:34:22,523
What about your daughter?

949
01:34:28,134 --> 01:34:29,829
What are you thinking, Chico?

950
01:34:31,971 --> 01:34:36,101
I was imagining these two...

951
01:34:36,809 --> 01:34:40,267
...flying up...

952
01:34:40,446 --> 01:34:42,437
...higher into the sky.

953
01:34:58,564 --> 01:34:59,861
It's weird.

954
01:35:02,368 --> 01:35:04,097
This is weird!

955
01:35:09,275 --> 01:35:10,537
Weird.

956
01:35:16,649 --> 01:35:18,276
Come out, you son of a bitch.

957
01:35:19,619 --> 01:35:21,746
Come out!

958
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:29,050
What can you see?

959
01:35:29,462 --> 01:35:31,225
It's trying to stab me in the eye!

960
01:35:38,237 --> 01:35:40,762
Want to stab me?

961
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:42,639
Son of a bitch!

962
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:48,640
There's no one there, man.

963
01:35:48,814 --> 01:35:51,806
There's no one there.
What's wrong, man? It's me!

964
01:35:51,984 --> 01:35:55,943
Jesus, brother, you're too crazy, Zico.
It's me, man!

965
01:35:56,122 --> 01:35:58,147
Give me the knife.

966
01:35:58,424 --> 01:35:59,982
Give me the knife.

967
01:36:01,927 --> 01:36:03,519
Give me the knife.

968
01:36:03,696 --> 01:36:05,561
Get a grip, Zico.

969
01:36:05,731 --> 01:36:07,392
You're trying to get yourself killed?

970
01:36:16,942 --> 01:36:18,500
Stop smoking, Zico.

971
01:36:20,579 --> 01:36:22,240
Stop smoking, man.

972
01:36:23,082 --> 01:36:25,812
I don't want that shit in here anymore!

973
01:36:41,033 --> 01:36:43,866
So, Mr. Pires, shall I go
and fetch the old man?

974
01:36:44,136 --> 01:36:46,195
No, let him be.

975
01:37:51,036 --> 01:37:56,235
When I went to visit Zico, Deusdete
didn't let us do crack in there.

976
01:37:56,409 --> 01:37:59,901
- That's no reason to kill!
- I was scared shitless.

977
01:38:00,079 --> 01:38:04,709
- Went to bed and woke up burned.
- How dare he kill without asking us?

978
01:38:04,884 --> 01:38:07,682
Mind your own business.

979
01:38:07,853 --> 01:38:09,718
He was a childhood friend.

980
01:38:09,889 --> 01:38:13,518
If you had a friend to advise you,
would you have done the same thing?

981
01:38:13,993 --> 01:38:15,460
That's their problem.

982
01:38:16,195 --> 01:38:17,594
You're wrong.

983
01:38:17,963 --> 01:38:20,124
Now it's our problem.

984
01:38:21,934 --> 01:38:23,128
Here she comes!

985
01:39:10,349 --> 01:39:12,408
Too Bad, honey...

986
01:39:13,152 --> 01:39:16,019
...do you take Lady as your true wife?

987
01:39:16,889 --> 01:39:17,947
Yes.

988
01:39:21,927 --> 01:39:23,360
And do you, Lady...

989
01:39:23,996 --> 01:39:26,760
...take Too Bad as your husband?

990
01:39:29,201 --> 01:39:30,259
I do.

991
01:39:35,508 --> 01:39:38,602
Then, as the presiding queen,
I hereby declare you...

992
01:39:38,878 --> 01:39:41,676
...man and wife!

993
01:40:02,968 --> 01:40:03,992
Kiss!

994
01:40:04,169 --> 01:40:05,363
Kiss!

995
01:40:05,771 --> 01:40:08,535
- Kiss!
- First, I want to propose a toast.

996
01:40:08,807 --> 01:40:10,069
To the doctor!

997
01:40:13,379 --> 01:40:16,780
Because thanks to all the
medicine this gentleman...

998
01:40:16,949 --> 01:40:20,077
...has taught me, I'm going out
to open my own clinic.

999
01:40:23,656 --> 01:40:26,216
While I wait for you, my beauty...

1000
01:40:27,326 --> 01:40:30,056
...so we can start our own family.

1001
01:40:33,766 --> 01:40:35,825
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

1002
01:40:36,001 --> 01:40:38,162
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

1003
01:41:03,262 --> 01:41:04,456
Highness...

1004
01:41:05,831 --> 01:41:07,799
...can't I have some on account?

1005
01:41:09,134 --> 01:41:10,396
What the fuck?!

1006
01:41:12,738 --> 01:41:13,864
Son of a bitch!

1007
01:41:59,585 --> 01:42:00,882
Jesus, he chickened out.

1008
01:42:05,991 --> 01:42:07,151
Ezequiel.

1009
01:42:08,527 --> 01:42:10,051
Come here.

1010
01:42:11,997 --> 01:42:13,396
Come here, Ezequiel!

1011
01:42:35,954 --> 01:42:40,391
Hey, Ezequiel, you think
that bastard Zico...

1012
01:42:40,559 --> 01:42:43,357
...is to blame for all your misery, right?

1013
01:42:44,563 --> 01:42:45,587
Sure...

1014
01:42:46,799 --> 01:42:50,701
...but Ezequiel's life has
always been miserable.

1015
01:42:51,937 --> 01:42:54,565
And wasn't it Zico
who made Ezequiel...

1016
01:42:54,740 --> 01:42:57,937
...offer his sister for the drugs?

1017
01:42:58,143 --> 01:43:01,340
Sure, what was I supposed to do?

1018
01:43:03,215 --> 01:43:05,046
So forget it.

1019
01:43:05,651 --> 01:43:07,312
You did it.

1020
01:43:07,486 --> 01:43:09,681
Ezequiel stabbed Zico...

1021
01:43:09,855 --> 01:43:11,789
...over 30 times.

1022
01:43:13,859 --> 01:43:15,383
But Highness...

1023
01:43:17,329 --> 01:43:20,196
...Ezequiel will be out
in just two years.

1024
01:43:21,333 --> 01:43:25,497
- Lf I do that, I'll get another 20!
- Two years, 20 years...

1025
01:43:25,671 --> 01:43:29,198
...what's the difference to Ezequiel?
Ezequiel has AIDS.

1026
01:43:30,109 --> 01:43:34,170
At least you'll get a cell to yourself...

1027
01:43:34,346 --> 01:43:36,177
...laundry...

1028
01:43:36,348 --> 01:43:39,078
...and, of course, crack to smoke.

1029
01:44:15,454 --> 01:44:17,217
I was the one who wiped out Zico.

1030
01:44:19,358 --> 01:44:21,792
Now I don't owe anyone a thing.

1031
01:44:49,555 --> 01:44:50,817
Bye, Chico!

1032
01:44:53,959 --> 01:44:55,187
Have faith!

1033
01:44:57,329 --> 01:44:58,523
Go in peace!

1034
01:45:03,569 --> 01:45:05,036
See you.

1035
01:45:07,673 --> 01:45:09,163
Good luck, Chico!

1036
01:45:30,829 --> 01:45:31,887
Old man?

1037
01:45:33,899 --> 01:45:35,264
Go in peace.

1038
01:45:37,336 --> 01:45:39,167
Keep it.

1039
01:45:39,404 --> 01:45:42,373
You need all the peace
you can get in there.

1040
01:46:04,596 --> 01:46:06,461
Why didn't you knife me?

1041
01:46:10,168 --> 01:46:12,659
I couldn't. What about him?

1042
01:46:13,839 --> 01:46:15,101
He won't leave me alone.

1043
01:46:16,608 --> 01:46:18,235
Follows me everywhere.

1044
01:46:18,610 --> 01:46:22,068
So, Zico, up in heaven,
did you meet anyone?

1045
01:46:22,247 --> 01:46:25,216
No one you know, just him.

1046
01:46:27,085 --> 01:46:30,384
No, Zico, what about God?

1047
01:46:34,927 --> 01:46:38,795
Not God in person.
I haven't seen him yet.

1048
01:47:28,146 --> 01:47:29,170
What's wrong?

1049
01:47:30,382 --> 01:47:35,319
Doctor, how can you tell whether
you're going mad?

1050
01:47:36,855 --> 01:47:42,191
Zico came back to haunt me
because I couldn't kill him.

1051
01:47:42,427 --> 01:47:45,954
You been seeing ghosts, Dagger?

1052
01:47:46,131 --> 01:47:48,361
A guy like me...

1053
01:47:49,434 --> 01:47:51,868
...unable to kill?

1054
01:47:52,537 --> 01:47:55,301
Never happened before!

1055
01:47:56,141 --> 01:47:58,541
Isn't that a good thing?

1056
01:47:58,710 --> 01:48:00,678
I only know how to kill.

1057
01:48:02,381 --> 01:48:03,780
That's how I grew up.

1058
01:48:05,117 --> 01:48:07,051
We change, Dagger.

1059
01:48:07,219 --> 01:48:08,277
Doctor...

1060
01:48:09,321 --> 01:48:12,222
...I have to know what's
happening to me.

1061
01:48:13,058 --> 01:48:15,083
Am I no longer myself?

1062
01:48:16,661 --> 01:48:19,892
Maybe it's your guilt over having
killed so many.

1063
01:48:24,169 --> 01:48:25,500
Doctor...

1064
01:48:28,507 --> 01:48:31,032
...is there a cure for guilt?

1065
01:48:35,881 --> 01:48:38,975
If there were,
everyone would want some.

1066
01:49:32,404 --> 01:49:33,530
Father.

1067
01:50:22,487 --> 01:50:24,114
Enter, brother.

1068
01:50:26,825 --> 01:50:28,292
Come!

1069
01:50:30,762 --> 01:50:31,786
Come!

1070
01:50:32,364 --> 01:50:35,356
Did you know the Lord
has a plan for you?

1071
01:50:36,968 --> 01:50:38,196
Enter!

1072
01:50:38,370 --> 01:50:40,235
This is your home.

1073
01:50:44,509 --> 01:50:45,999
You're lost, brother.

1074
01:50:46,378 --> 01:50:49,779
You don't know it,
but it was he who brought you here.

1075
01:50:52,350 --> 01:50:54,978
- Who, Father?
- Jesus!

1076
01:50:55,887 --> 01:50:59,448
He knows you can't sleep
if you haven't harmed someone...

1077
01:50:59,624 --> 01:51:04,152
...that you have sleepless nights
unless you've thrown a man down.

1078
01:51:04,329 --> 01:51:09,289
Isn't that what it's like every day,
brother? Come on, isn't it?

1079
01:51:09,467 --> 01:51:10,661
Yes, Father!

1080
01:51:12,304 --> 01:51:13,669
Yes, it is!

1081
01:51:14,773 --> 01:51:17,571
There is so much blood on me,
Father!

1082
01:51:17,742 --> 01:51:20,040
So, brother, kneel down.

1083
01:51:20,212 --> 01:51:22,271
Come on, kneel down!

1084
01:51:22,447 --> 01:51:24,574
Will you accept Jesus?

1085
01:51:24,749 --> 01:51:28,276
Will you accept Jesus? Will you?

1086
01:51:28,453 --> 01:51:31,388
Well, brother, will you accept Jesus?!

1087
01:51:34,893 --> 01:51:37,293
Which of you has accepted Jesus?

1088
01:51:37,462 --> 01:51:39,362
- I have!
- I have!

1089
01:51:39,531 --> 01:51:40,691
Hallelujah!

1090
01:51:40,865 --> 01:51:42,127
Hallelujah!

1091
01:51:46,871 --> 01:51:50,807
Criminals of Brazil,
the big day is here:

1092
01:51:51,109 --> 01:51:54,601
The Pavilion 9 finals!

1093
01:51:54,779 --> 01:51:59,546
Marsh going for the trophy
with Valiant, Samuel, Dadá, Saint...

1094
01:51:59,718 --> 01:52:02,881
...lndian Boa Ventura,
Minimum Wage, Valdir...

1095
01:52:03,054 --> 01:52:06,182
...AR15, Hildo, Ribeiro and Gererê!

1096
01:52:08,860 --> 01:52:14,457
Tornado 2000 is here with Little Eye,
Sleeve, White Feather, Gringo...

1097
01:52:14,633 --> 01:52:18,694
...Salomão Ayala, Eddie Murphy,
Greenhouse Joe, Zelão...

1098
01:52:18,870 --> 01:52:22,328
...Flavinho, Ebony 10 and Tafarel!

1099
01:54:20,692 --> 01:54:26,062
To kick off this glorious sporting
event, none other than our healer...

1100
01:54:26,231 --> 01:54:31,533
...the wizard of medical alchemy
and official trainer of the criminals!

1101
01:54:46,251 --> 01:54:47,878
And they're off!

1102
01:54:48,052 --> 01:54:50,247
Saint passes to AR15,
Dadá covering him.

1103
01:54:50,422 --> 01:54:55,086
Marsh on the attack!
Forcing the ball back...

1104
01:54:55,260 --> 01:54:58,093
...into the hands of Tafarel!

1105
01:54:58,363 --> 01:55:02,891
Up goes the ball! And it's out.

1106
01:55:04,936 --> 01:55:06,528
This is one fast kick.

1107
01:55:07,205 --> 01:55:09,264
Eddie Murphy gets the ball...

1108
01:55:09,441 --> 01:55:12,342
...and they go on the attack.

1109
01:55:12,977 --> 01:55:16,743
They go onto the opposite field.
Capote blocks.

1110
01:55:18,783 --> 01:55:19,772
Hello.

1111
01:55:21,052 --> 01:55:23,885
- So, Beard, you all right?
- Couldn't be better.

1112
01:55:24,055 --> 01:55:25,716
Have a good weekend.

1113
01:55:27,091 --> 01:55:31,585
Unfortunately, the Beard was wrong.
He needed some of Chico's wisdom...

1114
01:55:31,763 --> 01:55:36,393
...who once said to me;
"A quiet, obedient jail?

1115
01:55:36,568 --> 01:55:39,036
Sure sign of trouble."

1116
01:55:39,737 --> 01:55:42,797
Two weeks later,
when I got back...

1117
01:55:42,974 --> 01:55:46,740
...there were nothing but bullet holes
covering the walls.

1118
01:55:52,050 --> 01:55:54,041
Hey, you!

1119
01:55:54,219 --> 01:55:56,779
- Go find your own line.
- I'll use this one.

1120
01:56:00,792 --> 01:56:01,986
Go away!

1121
01:56:07,599 --> 01:56:10,159
- Are you crazy, man?!
- Let me dry my clothes!

1122
01:56:10,335 --> 01:56:13,600
- You've got some nerve, man!
- What's it got to do with you?

1123
01:56:13,805 --> 01:56:15,602
Stop!

1124
01:56:16,074 --> 01:56:18,201
Stop or I'll shoot!

1125
01:56:19,611 --> 01:56:22,774
Some say it started because of
a debt for five packs of cigarettes.

1126
01:56:23,147 --> 01:56:26,378
Others say that it was a fight
over the soccer game.

1127
01:56:27,051 --> 01:56:30,418
One or two say it was about
a pair of underpants.

1128
01:56:30,588 --> 01:56:33,056
Like they say:

1129
01:56:33,224 --> 01:56:35,283
"Jail's no home for the truth."

1130
01:56:39,364 --> 01:56:41,332
And Dadá's down, it's a penalty!

1131
01:56:49,040 --> 01:56:51,565
Dadá's taking the penalty himself.

1132
01:56:51,743 --> 01:56:54,473
Getting ready...

1133
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:56,977
...concentrating.
Go on, Dadá!

1134
01:57:00,285 --> 01:57:03,015
Goal!

1135
01:57:03,187 --> 01:57:08,284
Mangue wins!
Dadá's touched.

1136
01:57:13,064 --> 01:57:14,258
Jesus Christ!

1137
01:57:15,066 --> 01:57:18,160
- Let your head...
- Watch out, Rabbit's gang is coming.

1138
01:57:21,706 --> 01:57:24,869
- Just look what you did to him.
- Greedy bastard!

1139
01:57:25,043 --> 01:57:29,139
- You could have used your hand, man!
- Just over a pair of underpants!

1140
01:57:29,314 --> 01:57:30,372
What's wrong with you?

1141
01:57:30,548 --> 01:57:31,947
- Wait!
- Let me go!

1142
01:57:32,116 --> 01:57:35,574
- Why couldn't you have waited?
- What's it got to do with you?

1143
01:57:35,753 --> 01:57:37,584
- Stop it!
- Wait!

1144
01:57:37,956 --> 01:57:40,481
- What is it, man?
- Go fuck yourself, damn it!

1145
01:57:45,863 --> 01:57:47,592
We're the champions!

1146
01:57:48,099 --> 01:57:50,499
We're the champions!

1147
01:57:51,336 --> 01:57:53,998
We're the champions!

1148
01:57:59,744 --> 01:58:00,904
Yeah, yeah!

1149
01:58:04,649 --> 01:58:06,310
I was scared, doctor.

1150
01:58:07,085 --> 01:58:09,076
All hell broke loose...

1151
01:58:09,454 --> 01:58:12,890
...and when the blood boils,
criminals lose all control.

1152
01:58:13,491 --> 01:58:18,224
With the confusion, I could
easily have gotten hurt badly.

1153
01:58:26,671 --> 01:58:28,502
Riot in 9!

1154
01:58:28,740 --> 01:58:31,470
The place is ours!

1155
01:58:32,210 --> 01:58:35,941
Forget it, let them die if they
want. Let's get to our cell!

1156
01:58:47,291 --> 01:58:48,622
The war's started!

1157
01:58:49,327 --> 01:58:50,692
The war's started!

1158
01:58:50,862 --> 01:58:52,261
The war's started!

1159
01:59:11,783 --> 01:59:13,410
War! Let's torch the place!

1160
01:59:34,205 --> 01:59:38,608
Another explosion in the
overcrowded Detention Center...

1161
01:59:38,776 --> 01:59:41,176
...which is the biggest
in Latin America...

1162
01:59:41,345 --> 01:59:43,711
...with a total capacity
of 4000 inmates.

1163
01:59:43,881 --> 01:59:47,840
Only, nowadays it's more crowded
than ever...

1164
01:59:48,019 --> 01:59:50,283
...with 7500 prisoners!

1165
01:59:51,022 --> 01:59:55,584
The riot squad has been called
and is storming the jail...

1166
01:59:55,760 --> 01:59:59,992
...with over 300 men with revolvers,
machine guns and tear gas.

1167
02:00:00,198 --> 02:00:02,928
By then, no one could
hear a damn thing.

1168
02:00:03,101 --> 02:00:08,630
Through the bars we could see
a bunch of masked cops.

1169
02:00:08,806 --> 02:00:13,140
All you could see was their eyes,
the dogs, machine guns...

1170
02:00:13,311 --> 02:00:16,246
...and a helicopter flying real low,
pointing a machine gun at us.

1171
02:01:16,841 --> 02:01:18,604
Certainly, sir, right away!

1172
02:01:19,143 --> 02:01:21,338
Orders from the governor.

1173
02:01:21,612 --> 02:01:25,946
- You're in charge now, colonel.
- The troops will do what's necessary.

1174
02:01:26,117 --> 02:01:27,675
You're an experienced man.

1175
02:01:27,852 --> 02:01:32,186
- Lf you need to move in, go ahead.
- No, he can't! This is my jail!

1176
02:01:36,494 --> 02:01:38,325
Squad, attention!

1177
02:01:38,996 --> 02:01:42,227
Pay attention, men!
Return to your cells!

1178
02:01:42,867 --> 02:01:45,734
Back to your cells,
otherwise the cops are coming in!

1179
02:01:45,903 --> 02:01:48,133
If they come in here, they'll all die!

1180
02:01:48,306 --> 02:01:52,868
Mr. Pires, plenty of men should
have been released by now!

1181
02:01:53,211 --> 02:01:57,614
We want better conditions!

1182
02:01:57,782 --> 02:02:00,182
Mr. Pires, send the riot squad away!

1183
02:02:00,351 --> 02:02:02,512
Go back to your cells!

1184
02:02:02,687 --> 02:02:05,622
Everyone back to his cell
or you'll regret it!

1185
02:02:05,790 --> 02:02:07,883
No regrets in here!

1186
02:02:08,059 --> 02:02:09,856
How many hostages do you have?

1187
02:02:10,161 --> 02:02:12,425
Are there hostages in there?

1188
02:02:12,597 --> 02:02:14,792
We're no hostages, Mr. Pires!

1189
02:02:14,999 --> 02:02:17,263
This is our fight, Mr. Pires!

1190
02:02:18,002 --> 02:02:19,264
See, colonel?

1191
02:02:19,437 --> 02:02:23,635
They've no hostages, no water,
no electricity. They'll give in soon.

1192
02:02:23,808 --> 02:02:26,538
Save us, Mr. Pires!
Don't let them come in here.

1193
02:02:26,711 --> 02:02:28,338
Send the riot squad away!

1194
02:02:28,546 --> 02:02:30,878
I'm having a tough time
holding them back!

1195
02:02:31,048 --> 02:02:32,879
Let's keep calm!

1196
02:02:33,050 --> 02:02:34,984
Let's keep calm!

1197
02:02:35,152 --> 02:02:37,017
Now, hand over your weapons!

1198
02:02:37,188 --> 02:02:39,281
Surrender your weapons!

1199
02:03:20,831 --> 02:03:25,325
See, colonel? Everything's calm.
You can send them away.

1200
02:03:26,804 --> 02:03:30,865
Pay attention!
Everyone back to your cells!

1201
02:03:31,142 --> 02:03:33,940
Return to your cells!

1202
02:03:34,912 --> 02:03:36,812
Let's stay calm!

1203
02:03:37,581 --> 02:03:40,516
Back to your cells!

1204
02:03:45,856 --> 02:03:49,815
With an election coming up, the
governor wouldn't let the jail explode.

1205
02:03:56,467 --> 02:03:57,593
Go on, get in!

1206
02:04:39,910 --> 02:04:40,934
You!

1207
02:04:41,779 --> 02:04:44,043
Show us the way, let's go!

1208
02:04:53,190 --> 02:04:57,627
We may be a bunch of ignorant
thieves and murderers...

1209
02:04:57,795 --> 02:04:59,695
...but we're not stupid.

1210
02:05:00,398 --> 02:05:02,059
No one wants to die.

1211
02:05:02,600 --> 02:05:05,831
As they came in,
we ran to our cells.

1212
02:05:06,003 --> 02:05:09,200
We couldn't put up a fight
with knives and sticks.

1213
02:05:23,187 --> 02:05:26,748
Go back, I'm warning you!
We've got AIDS! You're gonna die!

1214
02:05:31,962 --> 02:05:36,524
They came in to kill us, doctor,
shouting we all had AIDS...

1215
02:05:36,934 --> 02:05:39,459
...that they'd catch it
if they touched us.

1216
02:06:10,734 --> 02:06:12,065
Turn right!

1217
02:06:12,403 --> 02:06:13,893
And left!

1218
02:06:19,143 --> 02:06:20,405
Hey, get out!

1219
02:06:20,578 --> 02:06:22,569
I want to stay with you!

1220
02:07:55,472 --> 02:07:58,635
Sergeant, let's play
cops and robbers.

1221
02:08:39,350 --> 02:08:42,251
You're going to live
to tell the tale.

1222
02:08:54,632 --> 02:08:55,826
I changed my mind.

1223
02:09:22,726 --> 02:09:26,184
Like hell he changed his mind!
It was pure spite.

1224
02:09:26,363 --> 02:09:30,299
He fed Ezequiel a glimmer of hope
so he could come back and kill him.

1225
02:09:34,038 --> 02:09:35,801
You two been causing trouble?

1226
02:09:35,973 --> 02:09:39,704
No way, we're sports fans.

1227
02:09:49,186 --> 02:09:52,553
So, you thief, how do you like
some of your own medicine?

1228
02:09:52,723 --> 02:09:54,452
You got lucky this time.

1229
02:10:44,041 --> 02:10:45,338
Who knows?

1230
02:10:45,976 --> 02:10:48,672
I guess he didn't have the courage
to shoot a woman.

1231
02:10:48,946 --> 02:10:51,005
It was our love that saved us.

1232
02:11:02,359 --> 02:11:05,624
It was the cop's son
who saved my life.

1233
02:11:06,263 --> 02:11:08,493
God bless the cop's son.

1234
02:11:08,665 --> 02:11:11,361
God bless that cop's son!

1235
02:11:11,602 --> 02:11:13,900
I'm unarmed!

1236
02:11:14,071 --> 02:11:15,561
Out of your cell!

1237
02:11:16,907 --> 02:11:18,374
Put your hands on the wall!

1238
02:11:18,742 --> 02:11:22,269
- I know you killed a cop!
- I never killed anyone, sir!

1239
02:11:22,446 --> 02:11:25,609
I'm only in for three years.
Spare me! Spare me!

1240
02:11:25,983 --> 02:11:29,384
Listen here. The only reason
this is your lucky day...

1241
02:11:29,553 --> 02:11:32,147
...is because you look like my son.

1242
02:13:17,361 --> 02:13:19,829
Anyone alive, undress
and come out naked!

1243
02:13:20,097 --> 02:13:22,565
Anyone alive, undress
and come out naked!

1244
02:13:23,367 --> 02:13:25,858
Anyone alive, undress
and come out naked!

1245
02:13:37,080 --> 02:13:39,947
I want to hear you say:
"Long live the riot squad!"

1246
02:13:40,117 --> 02:13:43,211
Go on! "Long live the riot squad!"

1247
02:13:43,887 --> 02:13:45,752
Louder, you murderer!

1248
02:13:46,023 --> 02:13:47,490
Long live the riot squad!

1249
02:13:47,858 --> 02:13:49,223
Long live the riot squad!

1250
02:13:49,726 --> 02:13:52,422
Everyone, now!
Long live the riot squad!

1251
02:13:52,596 --> 02:13:53,961
Long live the riot squad!

1252
02:13:54,131 --> 02:13:55,428
Long live the riot squad!

1253
02:13:55,599 --> 02:13:56,998
Long live the riot squad!

1254
02:14:03,707 --> 02:14:04,696
Go on!

1255
02:14:08,679 --> 02:14:09,907
Move it, come on!

1256
02:14:11,381 --> 02:14:14,475
- There's no one alive inside!
- Let's go, then!

1257
02:14:19,856 --> 02:14:21,187
Undress, everything! Come on!

1258
02:14:21,892 --> 02:14:23,484
Undress, everything!

1259
02:14:23,860 --> 02:14:26,124
- Undress!
- Heads down!

1260
02:17:16,700 --> 02:17:18,793
"Davilson, dearest son...

1261
02:17:20,103 --> 02:17:24,039
...your mother weeps when she thinks
of you when you were little...

1262
02:17:25,142 --> 02:17:27,770
...laughing deep into my eyes.

1263
02:17:29,312 --> 02:17:32,179
I know you never
believed in my God...

1264
02:17:32,682 --> 02:17:35,549
...but today, as I read the Bible...

1265
02:17:35,719 --> 02:17:39,052
...it was as if you were here
in my lap again.

1266
02:17:39,956 --> 02:17:44,325
My heart trembled as
I read Psalm 91.

1267
02:17:45,562 --> 02:17:48,053
What beautiful words.

1268
02:17:50,567 --> 02:17:55,266
A thousand may fall
at your right hand...

1269
02:17:56,206 --> 02:17:58,800
...but no evil will come near you...

1270
02:18:00,210 --> 02:18:02,678
...no scourge come near your tent."

1271
02:18:48,325 --> 02:18:53,627
In the late '80s, AIDS
prevention work in jails...

1272
02:18:53,797 --> 02:18:57,699
...took me to the São Paulo
Detention Center. Carandiru.

1273
02:18:58,235 --> 02:19:02,001
There I heard stories, made
real friends, learned medicine...

1274
02:19:02,172 --> 02:19:06,802
...and penetrated a few
of the mysteries of life in jail...

1275
02:19:06,977 --> 02:19:10,936
...which would have remained
inaccessible were I not a doctor.

1276
02:19:22,025 --> 02:19:24,016
- Morning, doctor.
- Good morning.

1277
02:19:26,897 --> 02:19:30,264
Even today, whenever I hear
the iron gates close behind me...

1278
02:19:30,433 --> 02:19:34,767
...I feel that shudder,
just like all those matinees...

1279
02:19:34,938 --> 02:19:39,568
...where I'd sit glued to my chair as
I watched all those jail films in B&W.

1280
02:19:42,545 --> 02:19:47,005
On October 2, 1992, 111 men died
at the São Paulo Detention Center.

1281
02:19:47,183 --> 02:19:49,913
There were no police deaths.

1282
02:19:50,086 --> 02:19:54,022
The only ones who know what
really happened are God...

1283
02:19:54,190 --> 02:19:56,988
...the police and the inmates.
I only heard the latter.

1284
02:19:59,562 --> 02:20:03,760
On September 15, 2002,
the last inmates were transferred.

1285
02:20:03,934 --> 02:20:06,300
Once empty, Carandiru
closed its doors.

1286
02:20:27,857 --> 02:20:33,386
On December 9, Carandiru
was finally demolished.
