1
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,530
Hey, Ebony!
Ebony!

2
00:01:26,732 --> 00:01:29,667
Hey, Ebony!
Open up!

3
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:32,561
Jesus, Ebony,
get this guy out of here!

4
00:01:32,771 --> 00:01:34,238
There's no more room,
Ebony.

5
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,001
We've got to use this cell.
Cool it, or there'll be trouble!

6
00:01:40,445 --> 00:01:42,413
I'll kill Dagger!

7
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,815
Lula was gonna knife him in
the back, the son of a bitch!

8
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:48,919
"Was"?
I still will!

9
00:01:49,121 --> 00:01:54,423
Dagger! I'll kill you, you hear?
Stick you like a pig.

10
00:01:55,394 --> 00:02:00,331
Ebony, Lula's freaked out,
says it 's his right to kill Dagger.

11
00:02:00,532 --> 00:02:03,262
Lula needs to be taught a lesson!

12
00:02:03,502 --> 00:02:09,031
Whatever's happened, it 's not for
you to decide, you little shit!

13
00:02:09,241 --> 00:02:10,640
Dagger's gonna die!

14
00:02:10,842 --> 00:02:11,831
Gonna die! Gonna die!

15
00:02:12,044 --> 00:02:14,638
Calm down!

16
00:02:19,384 --> 00:02:22,876
So you think you're gonna decide this,
Pimenta? Come on, then, I'm ready.

17
00:02:23,088 --> 00:02:24,487
Shut up, Dagger!

18
00:02:25,924 --> 00:02:28,552
Gonna die! Gonna die!

19
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,957
Like I said, I've got no one
waiting for me on the outside.

20
00:02:32,164 --> 00:02:34,223
I'm in no hurry to get out.

21
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:36,196
Anyone wants a fight,
let 's get on with it.

22
00:02:36,401 --> 00:02:38,596
I'll crush all of you.

23
00:02:38,804 --> 00:02:41,739
So what are we
waiting for?

24
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,740
What the fuck's wrong with
you guys?! Let 's cool it, here!

25
00:02:46,611 --> 00:02:48,306
What 's going on, Dagger?

26
00:02:48,513 --> 00:02:50,845
Lula attacked him from behind,
Ebony! He's a bad ass!

27
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:54,815
- He was within his rights!
- He went for Dagger from behind!

28
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,250
Right out of line, man!

29
00:02:57,456 --> 00:02:58,548
Let 's cool it,
man, calm down!

30
00:02:58,757 --> 00:03:00,987
"Calm down", my ass.
He's gonna die!

31
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,827
Gonna die!

32
00:03:07,032 --> 00:03:08,727
Gonna die!

33
00:03:08,934 --> 00:03:12,836
- You locking me in there, Ebony?
- First get in there, then speak!

34
00:03:13,705 --> 00:03:16,868
- Don't throw Dagger in here, Ebony!
- We don't want trouble.

35
00:03:17,075 --> 00:03:18,736
Get the hell out, damn it!

36
00:03:20,112 --> 00:03:25,209
So? I'm all ears.
How come he's so mad at you?

37
00:03:25,417 --> 00:03:30,411
You heard, Lula came out of nowhere
with a knife and tried to kill me.

38
00:03:30,622 --> 00:03:35,025
I dodged, and we scuffled
till they broke us up.

39
00:03:36,528 --> 00:03:39,122
The rest you know.

40
00:03:55,313 --> 00:03:57,372
Good morning, Mr. Pires.

41
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:01,079
I do apologize for this
disgusting behavior...

42
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:05,517
which has invaded
our household today.

43
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:13,996
Only this idiot Lula, a young,
inexperienced con...

44
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:18,158
suddenly got this attitude, without
even asking permission!

45
00:04:18,436 --> 00:04:21,496
Dagger killed my father!
He killed my father! It was him!

46
00:04:21,706 --> 00:04:23,435
I sure did, kid.

47
00:04:23,642 --> 00:04:27,305
And not only him,
I've killed plenty more besides!

48
00:04:27,512 --> 00:04:30,037
Ebony!
Mr. Pires!

49
00:04:30,448 --> 00:04:32,780
Dagger killed my father
in front of my mother.

50
00:04:32,984 --> 00:04:35,817
He's been telling everyone he
recognized her on Visitors Day.

51
00:04:36,021 --> 00:04:39,684
You gonna deny that, asshole?!
Are you gonna deny it? Are you?

52
00:04:39,891 --> 00:04:41,415
Ebony, please.

53
00:04:41,626 --> 00:04:42,615
What?

54
00:04:42,828 --> 00:04:46,559
Tell the kid he doesn't know
half the story. If he did...

55
00:04:46,765 --> 00:04:49,097
Son of a bitch!
I'll kill you!

56
00:04:49,301 --> 00:04:54,068
Tell him to ask his mother if she
was really as upset as all that.

57
00:04:54,272 --> 00:04:57,901
Or was it a relief when I came
and grabbed his belt from him?

58
00:04:58,109 --> 00:04:59,576
Lies! That 's a lie!

59
00:04:59,778 --> 00:05:02,303
Like hell it is!

60
00:05:02,514 --> 00:05:05,244
I saw it for myself.

61
00:05:05,984 --> 00:05:08,885
He'd have
thrashed her to death!

62
00:05:12,657 --> 00:05:14,750
Hey, Lula!

63
00:05:15,227 --> 00:05:18,685
I thought you'd have
heard by now, kid!

64
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:23,597
Your mother paid me
to kill your father!

65
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:28,003
Get it now?

66
00:05:28,473 --> 00:05:31,670
It was your mother wiped him out!

67
00:05:56,735 --> 00:05:59,169
Hear that?

68
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:04,201
He's calmed down!

69
00:06:13,018 --> 00:06:14,849
He's calmed down!

70
00:06:16,187 --> 00:06:19,384
I want them both out
here in their underwear.

71
00:06:47,152 --> 00:06:49,313
Hey, Lula...

72
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:53,218
as far as I'm concerned,
we're quits.

73
00:06:56,861 --> 00:06:59,022
Let 's forget it, shall we?

74
00:07:04,135 --> 00:07:09,471
You've put me to shame, and on the
day of the doctor's first visit.

75
00:07:16,581 --> 00:07:19,880
So, Lula, what brought
you back in here?

76
00:07:20,085 --> 00:07:24,419
I left here, went home and found
my wife in bed with someone else.

77
00:07:24,923 --> 00:07:27,391
The son of a bitch had the
nerve to tell me, "That 's life".

78
00:07:27,592 --> 00:07:29,787
I shot him three times just
to prove the contrary.

79
00:07:30,528 --> 00:07:35,591
You should know that whatever goes
on outside gets settled outside.

80
00:07:36,468 --> 00:07:40,598
In here,
anyone who behaves...

81
00:07:40,805 --> 00:07:43,774
knows we'll do what we can
to show him the front door...

82
00:07:43,975 --> 00:07:46,603
where his family is waiting.

83
00:07:46,811 --> 00:07:51,578
But anyone who's proud of being
a criminal, with blood in his eye...

84
00:07:51,983 --> 00:07:54,975
we'll do everything to
prolong his life in here!

85
00:07:56,621 --> 00:08:00,216
We usually forget people
like that in here.

86
00:08:05,196 --> 00:08:08,427
Doctor, this is Ebony.

87
00:08:12,237 --> 00:08:15,104
Yes, Doctor,
Ebony's got a problem.

88
00:08:16,674 --> 00:08:20,542
My kitchen knife
is still missing!

89
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,110
Whoever took it,
I'll give you one chance...

90
00:08:24,315 --> 00:08:28,115
return it, or there'll be
one prisoner dead every day!

91
00:08:30,088 --> 00:08:34,081
I'd like to ask our visitors
to turn their backs...

92
00:08:34,292 --> 00:08:37,887
since there's an ashamed
crook present.

93
00:08:38,096 --> 00:08:39,723
But...

94
00:08:39,931 --> 00:08:42,126
when I turn around...

95
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:45,700
I sure would like
to see that knife.

96
00:08:46,838 --> 00:08:49,204
I'll count to three.

97
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,204
One...

98
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:53,434
two...

99
00:08:53,645 --> 00:08:56,739
I'm turning...

100
00:08:58,316 --> 00:09:00,614
Three!

101
00:09:08,426 --> 00:09:11,793
- From your kitchen?
- Yes, sir!

102
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:16,794
This is the yellow wing, Doctor,
because they're afraid.

103
00:09:17,001 --> 00:09:19,299
It 's like a jail within the jail.

104
00:09:19,504 --> 00:09:22,439
They're locked up here for their
own safety. They're scared.

105
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,838
Career killers, rapists, stool
pigeons, bad payers.

106
00:09:27,045 --> 00:09:29,309
In here, you know,
prisoners never forgive.

107
00:09:29,514 --> 00:09:34,008
Mr. Pires, don't these people
ever get sun? It 's so musty!

108
00:09:36,955 --> 00:09:41,187
Anyone want to go outside?
Take a walk in the yard?

109
00:09:41,659 --> 00:09:44,685
Get some fresh air?

110
00:09:57,876 --> 00:09:59,867
Mr. Pires, what do these
people do all day?

111
00:10:00,078 --> 00:10:03,445
They come and go all day long,
think they're busy...

112
00:10:03,648 --> 00:10:05,843
but it gets them nowhere.

113
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:09,019
Doctor, 7,OOO men in jail!

114
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,688
There are 1,8OO
in this pavilion alone.

115
00:10:12,123 --> 00:10:15,957
If they knew how AIDS is spread,
that 'd already help.

116
00:10:16,161 --> 00:10:19,460
They catch the disease, then have
sex with their wife, girlfriend...

117
00:10:19,664 --> 00:10:20,926
so there's no stopping
the epidemic.

118
00:10:21,132 --> 00:10:24,795
The only ones who'll listen to your
advice are the really smart ones...

119
00:10:25,003 --> 00:10:28,302
who only want to get out alive
in order to keep robbing.

120
00:10:28,506 --> 00:10:29,598
That 's their whole life.

121
00:10:29,807 --> 00:10:34,301
Maybe. But they're living
at the center of the disease.

122
00:10:35,013 --> 00:10:36,241
They're the prisoners here.

123
00:10:36,447 --> 00:10:39,575
Prisoners? They own this jail.
The only reason...

124
00:10:39,784 --> 00:10:41,752
this place doesn't explode
is because they don't want it to.

125
00:10:42,387 --> 00:10:44,446
God bless you, child.

126
00:10:46,658 --> 00:10:50,150
I didn't know you had a family.

127
00:10:50,828 --> 00:10:53,922
I thought I'd lost it.

128
00:10:54,132 --> 00:10:57,829
My whole life in jail, but even
so, I raised 18 kids...

129
00:10:58,036 --> 00:11:00,834
and not one of them has even been
near a police station.

130
00:11:01,439 --> 00:11:06,467
That girl, my youngest, she said
she no longer remembers my face...

131
00:11:06,678 --> 00:11:09,647
so she's decided
to come and visit.

132
00:11:09,847 --> 00:11:13,840
I'd like you to authorize
me to see her...

133
00:11:14,052 --> 00:11:15,246
on a day other than Visitors Day.

134
00:11:15,453 --> 00:11:18,251
I don't want my daughter
around all the scum.

135
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,485
That 's going to be tricky.

136
00:11:21,693 --> 00:11:25,561
What if the 7,OOO others
ask me the same thing?

137
00:11:26,397 --> 00:11:28,957
Excuse me.

138
00:11:33,905 --> 00:11:35,770
Good morning!

139
00:11:53,691 --> 00:11:56,592
Need anything, Doctor?
Coffee, sugar, chocolate?

140
00:11:56,794 --> 00:11:58,659
Soap, toothpaste?

141
00:11:58,863 --> 00:12:01,798
Joints are only two packs
of Marlboros each. Want one?

142
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,834
- I don't smoke.
- Too bad. Commerce, Doctor!

143
00:12:06,037 --> 00:12:08,801
Makes the world go round!

144
00:12:12,677 --> 00:12:14,668
Easy now...

145
00:12:15,546 --> 00:12:17,707
that 's it.

146
00:12:25,823 --> 00:12:27,882
He can't spit there.

147
00:12:28,092 --> 00:12:30,424
Tuberculosis. Anyone steps
on that spreads the disease.

148
00:12:31,429 --> 00:12:36,731
Doctor, if he had the strength,
he'd go to the sink.

149
00:12:36,934 --> 00:12:39,562
It 's not easy.

150
00:12:39,771 --> 00:12:43,036
He must be isolated.

151
00:12:43,241 --> 00:12:45,709
But where, Doctor?

152
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:55,181
- Name?
- Everyone calls me The Beard.

153
00:12:57,722 --> 00:13:00,156
Why are you here?

154
00:13:00,358 --> 00:13:01,882
Well...

155
00:13:02,026 --> 00:13:04,517
my brother was killed.

156
00:13:04,729 --> 00:13:09,757
Two days later, the murderer
had a little meeting with death...

157
00:13:09,967 --> 00:13:15,462
so suspicions fell upon my
good self. Some said I did it...

158
00:13:15,673 --> 00:13:19,200
and others came along and
said they saw it wasrt me.

159
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:22,937
So what with some saying it was
me and others saying not...

160
00:13:23,147 --> 00:13:24,774
here I am, five years now...

161
00:13:25,116 --> 00:13:28,711
waiting for the judge to decide.

162
00:13:29,087 --> 00:13:33,285
So, Beard, do you have
sex here in jail?

163
00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:36,359
Anyone who denies that is a liar.

164
00:13:36,561 --> 00:13:38,654
Use condoms?

165
00:13:38,863 --> 00:13:40,694
If I've got one, I do.

166
00:13:40,898 --> 00:13:43,128
- IV drugs?
- How dare you, Doctor?!

167
00:13:43,334 --> 00:13:46,326
I wonder, Beard!
What 's that mark on your arm?

168
00:13:53,411 --> 00:13:55,140
Bears next!

169
00:14:10,695 --> 00:14:12,287
My name's Alpio.

170
00:14:14,866 --> 00:14:17,630
Do you use drugs?

171
00:14:17,835 --> 00:14:18,961
Needles?

172
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:24,972
No way, Doctor, I got AIDS from
all the ass I've had in jail.

173
00:14:25,543 --> 00:14:27,204
Plenty of ass.

174
00:14:30,014 --> 00:14:33,973
Is it still won'th
taking the test?

175
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:42,220
I listen, give advice, a little
tenderness, hold them tight...

176
00:14:42,427 --> 00:14:45,521
and then they always give us
something nice in return...

177
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:50,463
a pack of cigarettes, some candy,
a slice of cheese.

178
00:14:50,668 --> 00:14:53,865
So many men shut up
in here, Doctor...

179
00:14:54,071 --> 00:14:56,631
without our feminine support.

180
00:14:56,841 --> 00:14:59,674
Yeah, I've got AIDS, Doctor,
but I didn't get it in here.

181
00:14:59,877 --> 00:15:03,313
I brought it in off the streets,
Doctor, and I can't complain.

182
00:15:03,514 --> 00:15:08,679
You come in here sick and they
treat you with respect, dignity...

183
00:15:08,886 --> 00:15:11,184
and that 's the greatest thing
in a crook's life.

184
00:15:11,456 --> 00:15:13,549
I'm a junky and dealer.

185
00:15:13,758 --> 00:15:16,750
In my business, if a guy doesn't
pay up, I can't take back...

186
00:15:16,961 --> 00:15:21,057
what I sold him. The bastars
already smoked it, snorted it.

187
00:15:21,265 --> 00:15:27,932
I take whatever he's got, and
if he's got nothing, I kill him.

188
00:15:29,207 --> 00:15:30,731
The other day, I tried to get an
extra banana from the guy who...

189
00:15:30,942 --> 00:15:35,709
delivers lunch. The bastard
said only if I kissed his banana.

190
00:15:36,047 --> 00:15:38,538
So what the hell,
I'm just crazy about bananas.

191
00:15:38,749 --> 00:15:43,186
Doctor, everyone in my cell's
got this itch. It 's unbearable.

192
00:15:44,055 --> 00:15:47,889
Scabies. I'll give
you some medicine.

193
00:15:48,693 --> 00:15:51,423
So how are you getting along?

194
00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:56,123
Doctor, after shooting cocaine
in the dark with a blunt needle...

195
00:15:56,334 --> 00:16:02,000
drawing blood with this rig
is hardly fair play, Doctor.

196
00:16:03,407 --> 00:16:05,136
Too bad!

197
00:18:40,931 --> 00:18:42,796
- Who are you?
- I'm the Doctor.

198
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,298
I was in the infirmary
taking blood samples.

199
00:18:45,503 --> 00:18:47,471
Just ask...

200
00:18:47,672 --> 00:18:50,436
Oh sure, like you have
to tell me who to ask!

201
00:18:50,641 --> 00:18:52,905
I'm calling the duty officer.

202
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,578
Wait here.
If no one can identify you...

203
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,578
you're staying
right where you are.

204
00:19:24,308 --> 00:19:25,570
Don't take it personally, Doctor.

205
00:19:25,776 --> 00:19:29,906
It 's their job to escape
and mine not to let them.

206
00:19:38,923 --> 00:19:41,255
Doctor!

207
00:19:43,227 --> 00:19:45,058
You coming back?

208
00:20:00,244 --> 00:20:05,375
I knew many of those men hadrt
shown thelrvlctlms any mercy...

209
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:10,452
but soclety has its judges.
And Iwasrt one of them.

210
00:20:10,654 --> 00:20:13,817
At the same tlme,
what dld I have to do with all that?

211
00:20:14,024 --> 00:20:19,155
I had two cholces:
Forget or go back.

212
00:20:21,031 --> 00:20:23,795
Take a deep breath.

213
00:20:25,703 --> 00:20:28,968
- Smoker?
- Just cigarettes, Doctor.

214
00:20:29,173 --> 00:20:31,733
- No crack?
- Never.

215
00:20:31,942 --> 00:20:33,773
Sleep well?

216
00:20:33,978 --> 00:20:36,208
Hardly, Doctor.
The mind never stops...

217
00:20:36,413 --> 00:20:38,540
what with one guy trying
to settle a score outside...

218
00:20:38,749 --> 00:20:42,515
another collecting a debt,
another trying to dig a tunnel.

219
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,551
And there goes another day.

220
00:20:44,755 --> 00:20:46,780
You still got much time to do?

221
00:20:46,991 --> 00:20:49,050
A few more years.

222
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,559
- And why did you come here?
- Legitimate self-defense, Doctor.

223
00:20:52,763 --> 00:20:53,752
That lands you
in jail nowadays?

224
00:20:53,964 --> 00:20:58,264
It did in my case.
Here's what happened, Doctor.

225
00:20:58,469 --> 00:21:03,372
It was Christmas, the bells
ringing, snow in the windows.

226
00:21:03,574 --> 00:21:09,535
Me, Bristles and Fatso arranged
to do a jewelry store job.

227
00:21:11,215 --> 00:21:16,175
Neat work, Doctor.
Never even fired a shot.

228
00:21:16,387 --> 00:21:17,411
The problem was later.

229
00:21:57,428 --> 00:21:59,794
How are we going to split it up?

230
00:21:59,997 --> 00:22:02,022
Fatso and I will make three
piles, and you choose first.

231
00:22:05,836 --> 00:22:08,327
Son, not now.

232
00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:11,702
Get out! Go on!

233
00:22:32,696 --> 00:22:36,154
You fucking moron!
We're splitting the loot...

234
00:22:36,367 --> 00:22:39,393
and you come at me with
your hand covered?

235
00:22:43,674 --> 00:22:46,734
It 's his own fault he died.

236
00:22:48,445 --> 00:22:51,437
What the fuck's going on?

237
00:22:51,782 --> 00:22:57,118
So you shot him in the heat of
the moment, but we'd agreed...

238
00:22:57,321 --> 00:23:01,485
for me to shoot you,
so we could take your share.

239
00:23:01,692 --> 00:23:04,286
So shoot!

240
00:23:07,064 --> 00:23:09,555
Go on, fire away!

241
00:23:12,836 --> 00:23:14,963
I can't, damn it.

242
00:23:15,172 --> 00:23:17,868
Give me your rod.

243
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,243
Oh my God!

244
00:23:29,486 --> 00:23:34,651
Being betrayed by your buddy for
nothing, Doctor...

245
00:23:34,858 --> 00:23:39,886
like Judas, the guy who
spat in the face of Jesus!

246
00:23:40,264 --> 00:23:42,596
So how does the story end?

247
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,826
It ends with me in here,
before your very eyes, Doctor.

248
00:23:46,036 --> 00:23:48,402
Fatso was arrested
in under two months.

249
00:23:48,605 --> 00:23:51,005
Doctor, ever seen a fat man
being beaten?

250
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:54,006
They even spill stuff they
werert asked.

251
00:24:18,202 --> 00:24:21,069
A man was killed here.
Did you see anything?

252
00:24:21,271 --> 00:24:22,932
No.

253
00:24:27,678 --> 00:24:33,082
Jesus, Fatso, you turned
me in for Bristles' murder!

254
00:24:33,283 --> 00:24:36,275
You could have just squealed
about the robbery.

255
00:24:36,487 --> 00:24:38,250
I fingered you for murder
because Bristles' brother...

256
00:24:38,455 --> 00:24:40,685
was going to kill me.

257
00:24:40,891 --> 00:24:43,985
We left his place together
for the jewelry store...

258
00:24:44,194 --> 00:24:48,358
then I came back alive,
and he got back dead.

259
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,767
I'm very upset.

260
00:24:53,804 --> 00:24:57,672
I could turn you in as
an accomplice...

261
00:24:57,875 --> 00:25:00,901
but I won't.
I'll back your story up...

262
00:25:01,111 --> 00:25:05,480
I killed him and threw him
in the river all by myself.

263
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:09,483
Thanks, Ebony!

264
00:25:09,686 --> 00:25:12,780
I knew I could count on you.

265
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:17,188
I'll forgive you,
but you owe me one.

266
00:25:17,394 --> 00:25:19,328
And did Fatso ever pay his debt?

267
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:23,626
No way! Fatso died
trying to escape.

268
00:25:23,834 --> 00:25:26,268
They spent two years
digging a tunnel.

269
00:25:42,853 --> 00:25:45,014
Let 's go, come on!

270
00:25:55,432 --> 00:26:00,631
Go on, Fatso.
Hurry up you big pile of shit!

271
00:26:01,538 --> 00:26:04,632
Cado! Give me a hand!
I'm stuck.

272
00:26:04,842 --> 00:26:08,403
Breathe in, man.
Suck yourself in.

273
00:26:08,612 --> 00:26:11,342
What do you mean?
I can't!

274
00:26:11,548 --> 00:26:13,243
Go back, then!

275
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:15,077
Go on!

276
00:26:16,353 --> 00:26:19,379
Gimme a break, Cado.
Pull, go on, pull!

277
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:22,718
Shit, Fatso, I told you! Eating
everyone else's leftovers!

278
00:26:22,926 --> 00:26:25,121
Pull, go on!

279
00:26:25,329 --> 00:26:28,389
- Please!
- Get him out the way!

280
00:26:29,266 --> 00:26:32,758
Fatso's frustrated
brothers knifed him.

281
00:26:34,972 --> 00:26:37,065
Hell of a way to die,
eh Doctor?

282
00:26:37,274 --> 00:26:39,765
Right under the Virgin Mary, and
not even she could protect him.

283
00:26:41,378 --> 00:26:42,777
Too bad.

284
00:26:44,715 --> 00:26:46,546
What about this pain?

285
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:51,346
Your problem, Ebony, is stress...
what big shot executives get.

286
00:26:51,555 --> 00:26:54,490
Take one of these before bed.
They'll help you sleep.

287
00:26:54,691 --> 00:26:56,989
If you don't get better,
come back.

288
00:26:57,194 --> 00:27:00,129
God protect you, Doctor.

289
00:27:03,867 --> 00:27:08,804
Doctor, come and see Chico's
balloon, quick!

290
00:27:17,548 --> 00:27:20,244
It 's the old mars obsession,
Doctor.

291
00:27:30,394 --> 00:27:32,328
Oh, too bad.

292
00:27:32,529 --> 00:27:34,554
May I?

293
00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:39,699
Hi, I'm Lady.
Lady Di.

294
00:27:39,903 --> 00:27:40,892
I've come to take the test.

295
00:27:41,104 --> 00:27:42,628
Please, take a seat.

296
00:27:53,283 --> 00:27:55,911
First I'd like to ask you
a few questions, Lady Di.

297
00:27:57,788 --> 00:28:00,951
I've seen this movie before,
Doctor.

298
00:28:01,158 --> 00:28:03,854
I've never needed
a blood transfusion...

299
00:28:04,061 --> 00:28:07,258
and I never pierce my veins.

300
00:28:07,598 --> 00:28:11,659
The only drug I use is
a joint now and then...

301
00:28:11,868 --> 00:28:15,031
when I watch
TV or for a little romance.

302
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:18,940
And partners, how many?

303
00:28:19,543 --> 00:28:21,204
Oh, about 2,OOO.

304
00:28:35,525 --> 00:28:37,652
May I?

305
00:28:41,431 --> 00:28:44,366
Lady, the silicone you
used isn't meant for that.

306
00:28:45,369 --> 00:28:47,234
As if I had the money for
something better, Doctor.

307
00:28:47,771 --> 00:28:49,238
Ever taken hormones?

308
00:28:49,439 --> 00:28:52,272
No way!
Hormones are dreadful!

309
00:28:52,476 --> 00:28:54,444
You take them and
nothing happens.

310
00:28:54,645 --> 00:28:57,808
And what our clients really like,
maybe you know, is to play the girl.

311
00:28:59,883 --> 00:29:00,907
Well, Lady...

312
00:29:01,118 --> 00:29:04,087
I think the time's come for you
to find out whether you're sick.

313
00:29:06,823 --> 00:29:09,291
I'll do it, Doctor.

314
00:29:09,926 --> 00:29:12,622
- Will it hurt?
- Not much.

315
00:29:43,427 --> 00:29:46,555
Get out of here.
Get out, man!

316
00:30:28,772 --> 00:30:30,296
Any room in there?

317
00:30:35,545 --> 00:30:37,604
Sure.

318
00:30:44,354 --> 00:30:46,288
Only it 'll cost you 2OO.

319
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:51,086
Pay for a bed?
I'm in jail, man!

320
00:30:52,062 --> 00:30:55,361
So you lived for free
on the outside, did you?

321
00:30:58,201 --> 00:31:01,295
If you want to stay,
sleep on the floor.

322
00:31:03,306 --> 00:31:07,208
Deusdete ain't sleeping
on no floor.

323
00:31:07,411 --> 00:31:10,710
He already has a place.

324
00:31:14,985 --> 00:31:17,249
Deusdete...

325
00:31:17,454 --> 00:31:19,684
just like I said,
right brother?

326
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:23,348
You ended up doing something
you shouldn't.

327
00:32:16,613 --> 00:32:18,103
And the rat?

328
00:32:18,315 --> 00:32:20,476
I smashed it against
the wall about ten times!

329
00:32:20,684 --> 00:32:23,175
Damn thing wouldn't let go!

330
00:32:26,156 --> 00:32:28,386
Sweet Mama, pray for me!

331
00:32:28,792 --> 00:32:31,352
It died?

332
00:32:31,661 --> 00:32:32,719
Like hell it did!

333
00:32:32,929 --> 00:32:37,229
So I grabbed it tight and stuck
my teeth into its brain.

334
00:32:37,434 --> 00:32:40,835
Then I just brushed my teeth,
and that was that.

335
00:32:41,838 --> 00:32:42,998
Easy, man!

336
00:32:43,206 --> 00:32:45,538
You've been beaten with iron bars
and never made a sound.

337
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,884
Cut your finger, Highness?

338
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:05,061
Jesus, Lula, smoking crack?
You can't operate like that!

339
00:33:05,262 --> 00:33:08,857
Sorry, Doctor, only I operate
better when I smoke.

340
00:33:09,065 --> 00:33:11,192
What?! You can't keep
a steady hand on crack!

341
00:33:11,535 --> 00:33:13,332
Ah, that 's where
you're wrong, Doctor.

342
00:33:13,537 --> 00:33:16,233
I see the veins all
shining and fluorescent.

343
00:33:16,439 --> 00:33:19,704
Looks like that casino
in Las Vegas!

344
00:33:20,577 --> 00:33:22,545
Take it easy, man!

345
00:33:22,746 --> 00:33:27,581
See, steady as a rock, and hardly
a millimeter between stitches.

346
00:33:27,784 --> 00:33:31,117
God protect you, Lula.
God bless you, God bless you all.

347
00:33:31,321 --> 00:33:34,813
That 's enough of God, Highness,
you're not kidding anyone!

348
00:33:35,025 --> 00:33:37,050
What, you married twice?

349
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:40,195
Well, Doctor, to me life's
a merry-go-round...

350
00:33:40,397 --> 00:33:42,695
and just the one horse
isn't enough.

351
00:33:42,899 --> 00:33:48,132
That one there, that 's Dalva's,
my princess!

352
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:10,187
Honey, score a goal for me?
Please?

353
00:34:13,096 --> 00:34:15,656
Like it?
Yeah, I bet you do.

354
00:34:28,311 --> 00:34:30,779
Do you believe in love
at first sight?

355
00:34:30,981 --> 00:34:33,541
What?!

356
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:36,617
Come with me. I'm going to ask
your parents for your hand.

357
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,220
Get out of here!
You don't even know me!

358
00:34:39,422 --> 00:34:42,687
- You're wrong!
- Wrong? You don't know me!

359
00:34:42,892 --> 00:34:46,988
Sure I do.
I know you just love spicy...

360
00:34:47,197 --> 00:34:49,290
- Sausage...
- Sausage!

361
00:34:49,499 --> 00:34:53,697
And I know you look gorgeous
in that pretty dress...

362
00:34:53,903 --> 00:34:56,269
And I know you deserve better
than that klutz over there.

363
00:34:56,473 --> 00:35:00,170
- My fianc!
- Fianc?!

364
00:35:00,377 --> 00:35:03,505
You're wasting your time.

365
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:08,783
Look what a great blend!

366
00:35:08,985 --> 00:35:12,011
We'll have one kid of each color.

367
00:35:14,491 --> 00:35:17,824
I'll be waiting in the car.

368
00:35:27,404 --> 00:35:30,202
Were you serious?

369
00:35:31,541 --> 00:35:34,203
Never been more.

370
00:35:34,411 --> 00:35:37,312
What the hell's going on, Dalva?
What are you doing here?

371
00:35:41,117 --> 00:35:43,677
Go on, go away, will you?

372
00:35:43,887 --> 00:35:45,878
What?! Honey, who is this?

373
00:35:46,189 --> 00:35:48,316
- I'm her husband.
- Husband?

374
00:35:48,525 --> 00:35:50,720
Sure. We're marrying.

375
00:35:50,927 --> 00:35:53,987
Don't grab me like that!
Stop it!

376
00:35:54,197 --> 00:35:57,166
Get out of here, go on!

377
00:36:01,438 --> 00:36:03,133
See?

378
00:36:03,339 --> 00:36:08,675
If he were in love with you,
he wouldn't have run off!

379
00:36:12,982 --> 00:36:17,316
Jesus! Letting some
guy steal his girl!

380
00:36:20,256 --> 00:36:23,555
Tomorrow at eight,
get your family together...

381
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,957
and I'll ask for your hand.

382
00:36:28,498 --> 00:36:32,059
I'd rather my daughter were dead
than marry a thieving nigger.

383
00:36:33,636 --> 00:36:35,866
You offend me, sir.
You've only just met me.

384
00:36:36,072 --> 00:36:39,564
I know enough to know you're
nothing but a lazy nigger!

385
00:36:39,776 --> 00:36:42,301
- Look here, sir, I came here...
- Forget it!

386
00:36:42,512 --> 00:36:45,037
You're too old to be
falling for some black man.

387
00:36:45,248 --> 00:36:47,876
Get down there!
Go on!

388
00:36:48,084 --> 00:36:49,073
Easy now!

389
00:36:49,285 --> 00:36:50,445
Down you go.

390
00:36:50,653 --> 00:36:53,747
Come on!

391
00:37:00,797 --> 00:37:02,992
I marrled her rlght there.

392
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:08,136
I took my love with me; my black
flst In hercotton-white hand.

393
00:37:09,706 --> 00:37:12,573
Best thing that could have
happened to me, Doctor.

394
00:37:12,776 --> 00:37:14,573
Dalva gave me a family.

395
00:37:14,778 --> 00:37:15,767
So you stopped stealing.

396
00:37:15,979 --> 00:37:20,245
Of course not, Doctor! With her
by my side, I went up-market.

397
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:22,816
Took imported cars and
drove them to Paraguay.

398
00:37:23,019 --> 00:37:25,954
With cash in my pocket, I returned
to the peace of home life.

399
00:37:28,057 --> 00:37:29,046
Any kids?

400
00:37:29,259 --> 00:37:32,524
Three with Dalva.
And one with Rosirene.

401
00:37:32,729 --> 00:37:36,825
You know how it is, the devil
only tempts those close to God.

402
00:37:37,033 --> 00:37:40,901
That ever happened to you?
Uncontrollable passion?

403
00:38:34,757 --> 00:38:38,090
What 's with the babe over there?

404
00:38:46,502 --> 00:38:50,632
What do you think?
She's over there.

405
00:38:55,478 --> 00:38:59,039
Don't you dance samba, miss?

406
00:39:01,584 --> 00:39:06,044
What am I, a monkey jumping
around for nothing?

407
00:39:09,492 --> 00:39:12,188
Looking for something
to jump to?

408
00:39:12,829 --> 00:39:16,765
Seems like you're the one wanting
to jump... jump ship.

409
00:39:19,335 --> 00:39:21,667
Look, I'll take my wife home.

410
00:39:21,871 --> 00:39:24,032
Get your bikini, and
I'll come and fetch you.

411
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,505
We'll go and spend the
weekend at the beach.

412
00:39:27,944 --> 00:39:29,536
Does that sister know you
belong to me?

413
00:39:29,746 --> 00:39:31,441
Ease up, Dalva!
I was only going to the john!

414
00:39:31,648 --> 00:39:35,084
Like hell you were. And that,
why's that so hard then?

415
00:39:35,285 --> 00:39:37,913
Doesrt look like it 's being
properly cared for.

416
00:39:40,623 --> 00:39:43,683
Watch your mouth,
you stinking black bitch!

417
00:39:43,893 --> 00:39:48,227
Get away from my man,
or you'll be sorry!

418
00:39:50,266 --> 00:39:54,362
Hey, handsome! So I guess
the beach is off, then?

419
00:40:01,077 --> 00:40:03,841
So what happened
to the black girl?

420
00:40:04,047 --> 00:40:06,880
Ah, now that 's where I had
to do a bit of juggling, Doctor.

421
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:10,610
From Monday to Thursday, Dalva.
And the rest, Rosirene.

422
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:13,584
I rented a little room for us
near the old bus station.

423
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:16,122
We had this great love affair
going, Doctor.

424
00:40:20,263 --> 00:40:22,094
Morning!

425
00:40:29,072 --> 00:40:30,869
Give me that!

426
00:40:31,074 --> 00:40:33,508
It 's mine!

427
00:40:36,212 --> 00:40:39,807
Stop, you're messing me up!

428
00:40:51,394 --> 00:40:57,390
Don't let go of me, Highness.
Don't let go!

429
00:40:59,669 --> 00:41:02,570
Thanks, Powder, see you around!

430
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,380
You just can't quit this life,
can you?

431
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:23,150
I thought I told you
I'd take care of you.

432
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:26,590
I've always earned
my own money.

433
00:41:27,263 --> 00:41:29,026
And that guy you were with,
know who he is?

434
00:41:29,232 --> 00:41:33,225
What are you doing here?
I thought it was Snow White's day.

435
00:41:33,436 --> 00:41:36,701
Don't change the subject!
You know who he is?

436
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,066
Sure!
So what?

437
00:41:40,443 --> 00:41:44,937
So I told you... do your
thing if you have to...

438
00:41:45,148 --> 00:41:48,675
but don't screw a friend of mine,
or I'll break your neck!

439
00:41:48,885 --> 00:41:51,513
Powder's your friend?!

440
00:41:51,721 --> 00:41:56,158
Highness, you're a nobody.

441
00:41:56,359 --> 00:42:02,764
He said that when he leaves
his wife, we'll move to Miami.

442
00:42:04,967 --> 00:42:07,458
- I'm off!
- Where to?

443
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:14,073
To Miami, honey!

444
00:42:14,277 --> 00:42:17,974
Well you're taking a souvenir
of mine with you!

445
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:29,522
That was rough, Doctor,
screwing a friend of mine...

446
00:42:29,725 --> 00:42:31,090
and the two of
them making plans!

447
00:42:31,294 --> 00:42:34,559
That night I went back to the
room and what do I see?

448
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,891
Jesus...

449
00:42:40,336 --> 00:42:43,203
get out of here!

450
00:42:43,406 --> 00:42:45,135
No way.

451
00:42:45,341 --> 00:42:48,367
Get out of here right now!

452
00:42:49,579 --> 00:42:52,070
I won't go.

453
00:42:52,281 --> 00:42:54,749
Get out, damn it!

454
00:42:54,951 --> 00:42:57,886
No way, I'm staying.

455
00:42:58,087 --> 00:43:01,784
Come on, Highness, bite me.

456
00:43:01,991 --> 00:43:05,620
Come on, bite me...

457
00:43:06,295 --> 00:43:09,458
bite me the way I like it.

458
00:43:11,534 --> 00:43:16,528
Bite, go on, bite!

459
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:25,744
Bite harder...

460
00:43:26,749 --> 00:43:28,979
harder!

461
00:43:53,676 --> 00:43:55,576
It 's over!

462
00:43:59,115 --> 00:44:02,050
There, that 's so you learn
not to take what 's not yours!

463
00:44:02,185 --> 00:44:03,743
You arsonist bitch!

464
00:44:03,953 --> 00:44:05,420
Slut!

465
00:44:05,621 --> 00:44:09,284
Well, you might as well know that
this slut is expecting his child.

466
00:44:09,492 --> 00:44:11,983
No!

467
00:44:12,862 --> 00:44:19,028
Son of a bitch whore!
I'll kill you!

468
00:44:19,235 --> 00:44:22,136
You haven't heard
the last of this, Highness...

469
00:44:22,338 --> 00:44:24,363
you son of a bitch whore!

470
00:44:24,574 --> 00:44:27,839
Son of a bitch!

471
00:44:30,613 --> 00:44:32,444
Get your hands off my son!

472
00:44:32,648 --> 00:44:35,583
To keep Dalva out of trouble,
I took the blame forthe flre.

473
00:44:36,953 --> 00:44:40,252
Only the law was already
on my back for other stuff...

474
00:44:40,456 --> 00:44:45,155
so I got 16 years for the fire,
reduced to 1O.

475
00:44:45,361 --> 00:44:46,350
And was it won'th it?

476
00:44:46,562 --> 00:44:53,024
But Doctor, the black chick put
a spell on me. I'm outta here!

477
00:44:53,436 --> 00:44:58,339
Therefore, perfectly calmly,
we shall overcome the nlggllng...

478
00:44:58,541 --> 00:45:02,136
Irresponslble and lylng attempts
to Involve the government...

479
00:45:02,345 --> 00:45:05,041
and presldent In accusatlons
by fallures who only survlve...

480
00:45:05,248 --> 00:45:09,150
through statements
Impregnated with jealousy...

481
00:45:09,352 --> 00:45:12,082
fabrlcatlons and resentment.

482
00:45:12,288 --> 00:45:15,155
Tlme wlll reveal the absurdity
of these attempts...

483
00:45:15,358 --> 00:45:18,623
and the law wlll punlsh
those truly responslble...

484
00:45:18,828 --> 00:45:22,025
forthe Irregularitles, for any
wrongdolngwhlch took place...

485
00:45:22,231 --> 00:45:24,222
and the creators of the false
accusatlons.

486
00:45:29,105 --> 00:45:32,131
Letter from Franci?

487
00:45:38,014 --> 00:45:40,710
Your sister mention me at all?

488
00:45:41,117 --> 00:45:44,052
Course she does, right?

489
00:45:48,724 --> 00:45:52,421
Hey, Deusdete! What does
your sister say about me?

490
00:45:54,263 --> 00:45:56,993
She asks if you're okay.

491
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,293
That all?

492
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:04,564
What do you think? If she knew
what you've been up to...

493
00:46:04,774 --> 00:46:07,140
she wouldn't even be asking that.

494
00:46:09,278 --> 00:46:12,076
I think she would...

495
00:46:12,281 --> 00:46:15,546
but you think you know better.

496
00:46:15,751 --> 00:46:20,779
Wasrt it you used to say,
"If you sell it, don't use it"?

497
00:46:23,192 --> 00:46:24,454
May I?

498
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:26,525
So what 's up?

499
00:46:27,897 --> 00:46:29,888
Come to settle your debt?

500
00:46:30,099 --> 00:46:34,058
Hey man, right now Ezequiel's
in a tight spot.

501
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:37,103
So he thinks to himself,
"Zico's a reasonable guy...

502
00:46:37,306 --> 00:46:40,537
He'll take the surfboard
as collateral for the debt."

503
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:44,409
Then Ezequiel can have another
little rock of crack, right man?

504
00:46:45,815 --> 00:46:47,715
Wrong!

505
00:46:54,657 --> 00:46:57,592
Pay what you owe!

506
00:47:02,198 --> 00:47:04,758
Don't drink that, it 's blood!

507
00:47:07,303 --> 00:47:09,464
Shit!

508
00:47:10,039 --> 00:47:11,506
I thought it was water.

509
00:47:11,707 --> 00:47:15,905
Doctor, this guy was
sweating all night long.

510
00:47:16,112 --> 00:47:18,876
I've put him on antibiotics,
but if you ask me, it 's no use...

511
00:47:19,081 --> 00:47:21,811
it 's AIDS.

512
00:47:23,619 --> 00:47:26,611
Doctor! Doctor!

513
00:47:26,822 --> 00:47:29,552
Who took away his oxygen?

514
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:34,151
I don't want to die.

515
00:47:34,363 --> 00:47:38,390
Get me out of here, please!

516
00:47:39,402 --> 00:47:43,395
That 's hardly likely.
He's 213, rape.

517
00:47:44,206 --> 00:47:46,401
To us he's a patient.

518
00:47:46,609 --> 00:47:48,270
Doctor...

519
00:47:48,477 --> 00:47:50,502
Doctor...

520
00:47:50,713 --> 00:47:53,341
send me
to the yellow wing.

521
00:47:53,549 --> 00:47:57,781
I need to get somewhere safe.

522
00:47:57,987 --> 00:47:58,976
I don't want to die!

523
00:47:59,188 --> 00:48:03,022
I'm sorry, Doctor,
I'm against the death penalty...

524
00:48:03,225 --> 00:48:05,455
but not for rape.

525
00:48:05,661 --> 00:48:09,062
If you ask me,
it 's just too bad.

526
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:17,700
So that 's it, Doctor.

527
00:48:55,644 --> 00:48:59,410
Come on, old man,
it 's past lock-down.

528
00:49:20,336 --> 00:49:22,861
Get a move on!

529
00:49:29,645 --> 00:49:32,910
What is it, what
are you looking at?

530
00:49:33,115 --> 00:49:36,983
You think your kids will jump
over the wall?

531
00:49:58,607 --> 00:50:02,134
You were asking for it this time,
werert you, Chico?

532
00:50:06,715 --> 00:50:10,173
See you in 3O days.

533
00:50:17,459 --> 00:50:23,193
Doctor, we're here to make
our relationship official.

534
00:50:23,399 --> 00:50:25,458
You understand,
Doctor...

535
00:50:25,668 --> 00:50:29,536
so we can be more open.
It 's not the same with a rubber.

536
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:34,906
There's not much sense,
her taking the test and not you.

537
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:39,137
See? I told him, Doctor,
but he's scared.

538
00:50:39,348 --> 00:50:42,215
- Scared of what?
- Scared of injections.

539
00:50:42,418 --> 00:50:43,578
Too Bad?!

540
00:50:44,219 --> 00:50:45,208
It 's not that.

541
00:50:45,421 --> 00:50:47,651
So you're scared
of getting married!

542
00:50:47,856 --> 00:50:51,223
Doctor, you're needed, urgently!

543
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:54,054
Down you go, come on.

544
00:50:54,263 --> 00:50:57,460
It 's all right now, Doctor.

545
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,426
I blacked out, Doctor.

546
00:51:01,637 --> 00:51:04,868
Giving us all a fright, Zico?

547
00:51:05,174 --> 00:51:08,507
It 's just as well, Doctor.
Maybe he'll learn what drugs do.

548
00:51:08,711 --> 00:51:09,871
Tell him!

549
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:13,606
What 's there to tell?
Drugs kill.

550
00:51:13,816 --> 00:51:16,808
- And you, who are you?
- That 's Deusdete.

551
00:51:17,019 --> 00:51:20,648
We grew up together.

552
00:51:20,956 --> 00:51:24,653
You know, Doctor, one day
my mom didn't come home.

553
00:51:25,828 --> 00:51:31,198
I was left alone.
I waited and waited...

554
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:36,136
until he and his sister,
Franci, came...

555
00:51:36,338 --> 00:51:39,432
and took me to live with them.

556
00:51:48,384 --> 00:51:49,612
We grew up together.

557
00:52:17,479 --> 00:52:20,209
Come on, Zico!

558
00:52:34,596 --> 00:52:36,860
Wait, Zico!

559
00:53:07,830 --> 00:53:11,766
Help! Help!

560
00:53:42,731 --> 00:53:45,529
It was Zico saved me, Doctor.

561
00:53:45,734 --> 00:53:51,400
That 's right, Doctor, I've always
looked after him, from early on.

562
00:53:51,607 --> 00:53:55,134
Then you went the wrong way.

563
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:01,875
Doctor, what 's wrong with buying
some dope in Pernambuco...

564
00:54:02,017 --> 00:54:04,747
and selling it to folks
who like it?

565
00:54:04,953 --> 00:54:08,150
It wasrt even that much!
Another two years, and I'm free.

566
00:54:08,357 --> 00:54:11,986
But I've never killed anyone.

567
00:54:12,194 --> 00:54:14,788
Unlike Deusdete, here.

568
00:54:14,997 --> 00:54:16,931
What was your crime?

569
00:54:17,132 --> 00:54:20,192
Answer him, Deusdete!

570
00:54:22,171 --> 00:54:28,735
To tell you the truth, Doctor,
he's not even a real criminal.

571
00:54:30,012 --> 00:54:32,947
So what are you in here for?

572
00:54:33,916 --> 00:54:37,215
One night, I was at home...

573
00:54:38,187 --> 00:54:41,213
when my sister arrived,
acting strange.

574
00:54:41,423 --> 00:54:46,918
What 's wrong, Franci?
What happened?

575
00:54:47,129 --> 00:54:48,790
Franci!

576
00:54:55,237 --> 00:54:58,297
Franci, what happened?

577
00:54:59,174 --> 00:55:01,734
Open up, come on!

578
00:55:01,944 --> 00:55:04,344
What happened?

579
00:55:10,786 --> 00:55:13,346
What happened, Franci?

580
00:55:16,258 --> 00:55:19,159
Tell me!

581
00:55:19,361 --> 00:55:22,421
What happened?

582
00:55:24,533 --> 00:55:26,626
Tell me!

583
00:55:26,835 --> 00:55:29,770
There were two of them.

584
00:55:30,939 --> 00:55:33,840
They grabbed me...

585
00:55:34,643 --> 00:55:37,441
lifted my skirt...

586
00:55:39,448 --> 00:55:43,680
one said he wanted to suck me.
I told him to go suck his mother!

587
00:55:43,886 --> 00:55:46,047
- What did they do to you?
- They beat me.

588
00:55:46,255 --> 00:55:49,053
What else, huh?

589
00:55:49,258 --> 00:55:50,316
What else?!

590
00:55:50,525 --> 00:55:53,426
- That 's all, Deusdete.
- Who was it?

591
00:55:53,629 --> 00:55:55,062
I just ran off!

592
00:56:05,207 --> 00:56:07,402
Hey, Zico!

593
00:56:09,845 --> 00:56:13,872
Deusdete! What are you
doing here, man?

594
00:56:14,082 --> 00:56:16,710
I need to talk.

595
00:56:16,919 --> 00:56:19,479
Excuse us.

596
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,591
Is Mother all right?

597
00:56:33,802 --> 00:56:38,000
It 's not her. Some guys
messed with Franci.

598
00:56:49,685 --> 00:56:51,983
What did they do to her?

599
00:56:52,187 --> 00:56:55,156
Nothing much, she says. But I
reported it to the cops, anyway.

600
00:56:56,058 --> 00:56:59,755
The cops?! You think
the cops'll do anything?!

601
00:56:59,962 --> 00:57:04,092
The problem is, the guys found
out, and now they're after me.

602
00:57:07,469 --> 00:57:08,766
Leave it to me.
I'll sort them out.

603
00:57:08,971 --> 00:57:15,069
No, Zico. Not your way.
I don't want that.

604
00:57:17,112 --> 00:57:20,707
I just want a gun,
to defend myself.

605
00:57:30,292 --> 00:57:32,920
Take your pick.

606
00:57:46,008 --> 00:57:49,944
Even with a gun, Doctor, I never
thought anything would happen.

607
00:57:51,346 --> 00:57:52,938
But...

608
00:57:53,148 --> 00:57:54,172
it was my destiny.

609
00:57:54,383 --> 00:57:56,817
And theirs,
when they found me.

610
00:58:05,761 --> 00:58:09,527
So! Where's the stool pigeon
off to tonight, then?

611
00:58:09,731 --> 00:58:11,722
I'm not looking for a fight.
Let me go home!

612
00:58:11,933 --> 00:58:16,393
Sure thing, but first we're
going to caress you...

613
00:58:16,605 --> 00:58:19,574
just like we did
your little sister.

614
00:59:57,339 --> 00:59:59,364
Hey, man!

615
01:00:32,707 --> 01:00:34,800
Give me a Coke.

616
01:00:40,182 --> 01:00:43,982
You know how old I'll be
when I get out of here, Doctor?

617
01:00:45,854 --> 01:00:48,186
Forty-eight!

618
01:00:49,457 --> 01:00:51,425
There!

619
01:00:56,831 --> 01:00:58,594
One...

620
01:00:59,301 --> 01:01:01,166
two...

621
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:04,100
three...

622
01:01:04,472 --> 01:01:06,497
four...

623
01:01:06,942 --> 01:01:08,807
five...

624
01:01:09,144 --> 01:01:10,736
six...

625
01:01:11,646 --> 01:01:13,614
seven...

626
01:01:16,184 --> 01:01:18,277
eight!

627
01:01:24,759 --> 01:01:27,956
Found it!

628
01:01:40,375 --> 01:01:43,435
So it 's Visitors Day, is it?

629
01:01:43,645 --> 01:01:46,045
If you like, you can go now.

630
01:01:56,691 --> 01:01:59,125
Ebony...

631
01:01:59,894 --> 01:02:03,694
I've got a problem.
I need to talk.

632
01:02:03,898 --> 01:02:06,025
This problem got a name?

633
01:02:06,234 --> 01:02:07,565
Ezequiel.

634
01:02:07,769 --> 01:02:10,431
He still owes me, and now he's
even trying to get more on account.

635
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:15,899
He comes to my cell, raises his
voice, what 's he playing at?!

636
01:02:16,111 --> 01:02:18,636
- And you?
- Me?

637
01:02:18,847 --> 01:02:22,305
If I don't get paid,
I can't pay Highness.

638
01:02:22,517 --> 01:02:25,350
I want your permission
to kill the bastard.

639
01:02:25,553 --> 01:02:28,522
This goes on much longer, I'll
start losing respect around here.

640
01:02:28,723 --> 01:02:30,486
Cool it!

641
01:02:31,893 --> 01:02:35,920
I'll tell Ezequiel to get
the money from his family.

642
01:02:36,131 --> 01:02:39,794
If he doesn't pay,
you can go ahead.

643
01:02:50,478 --> 01:02:52,810
This man has already lost a lung...

644
01:02:53,014 --> 01:02:54,675
and the other's in pretty
bad shape.

645
01:02:54,883 --> 01:02:57,681
Take the medicine, man, go on.

646
01:02:58,853 --> 01:03:00,946
See, Doctor?
He won't take it.

647
01:03:01,156 --> 01:03:06,219
What are you, a kid? You won't
get better if you don't take it.

648
01:03:07,262 --> 01:03:09,389
Come on, that 's right.

649
01:03:09,597 --> 01:03:12,430
Come on.

650
01:03:18,473 --> 01:03:20,270
That 's it.

651
01:03:22,143 --> 01:03:23,633
Right.

652
01:03:23,845 --> 01:03:24,834
Good.

653
01:03:25,046 --> 01:03:27,014
And on the outside?
What did he do?

654
01:03:27,649 --> 01:03:29,981
We used to rob armored trucks.

655
01:03:30,185 --> 01:03:34,519
Just the two of us, we planned
everything, remember?

656
01:03:34,723 --> 01:03:37,624
Doctor, we'd spend six months
just gathering information.

657
01:03:37,826 --> 01:03:39,885
We'd even make friends
with the guards' families.

658
01:03:40,095 --> 01:03:42,154
And that paid off?

659
01:03:42,364 --> 01:03:43,854
Sure, plenty.

660
01:03:44,065 --> 01:03:46,192
Although we'd
only use half the money.

661
01:03:46,401 --> 01:03:51,338
The rest we'd put aside
for a rainy day...

662
01:03:51,539 --> 01:03:52,767
or to bribe the cops.

663
01:04:06,588 --> 01:04:08,783
It 's coming.

664
01:04:13,061 --> 01:04:15,621
Right, get over there!

665
01:04:37,485 --> 01:04:38,474
Come on!

666
01:04:38,686 --> 01:04:40,153
Stop!

667
01:04:42,957 --> 01:04:45,926
Come on! You going to sit there
on top of other people's money?!

668
01:04:46,127 --> 01:04:48,652
If you don't come out, it 'll be
too bad for your widows.

669
01:04:48,863 --> 01:04:50,990
Open that door,
for Christ 's sake!

670
01:04:53,134 --> 01:04:54,692
Come on, get out!

671
01:04:54,903 --> 01:04:56,962
So we paid off the others...

672
01:04:57,172 --> 01:04:59,970
and each went his own way,
back to the family.

673
01:05:02,777 --> 01:05:06,611
So anyway, Antnio,
what 's on your mind?

674
01:05:08,483 --> 01:05:10,542
Miro...

675
01:05:11,386 --> 01:05:14,355
your wife's cheating on you.

676
01:05:14,823 --> 01:05:17,485
With a cop.

677
01:05:19,694 --> 01:05:20,683
Says who?

678
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:22,863
Says no one.
I saw her.

679
01:05:23,064 --> 01:05:27,057
They were making out
in a squad car.

680
01:05:27,435 --> 01:05:30,461
Near the old bakery.

681
01:05:39,347 --> 01:05:41,076
Dina doesn't buy bread there.

682
01:05:41,282 --> 01:05:44,513
Miro, I saw her. And it
wasrt bread she was after.

683
01:05:52,827 --> 01:05:54,385
Clia...

684
01:05:55,597 --> 01:05:59,055
is Antnio Carlos gay?

685
01:05:59,467 --> 01:06:02,163
What a question, Dina!

686
01:06:04,038 --> 01:06:05,062
I'm sorry, but he made
up this story...

687
01:06:05,273 --> 01:06:08,174
and told Miro I've been
going out with a cop.

688
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:12,976
Like hell I made it up.
I saw you crawling all over him.

689
01:06:13,181 --> 01:06:15,115
You nibbled his ear, damn it!

690
01:06:15,316 --> 01:06:18,717
Then it 's me he's really after,
honey.

691
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:21,388
You forgot the best part:

692
01:06:21,589 --> 01:06:25,116
How you asked me to run away
with you and dump Miro...

693
01:06:25,326 --> 01:06:28,921
and that I turned you down
because I love my husband...

694
01:06:29,130 --> 01:06:31,928
and your wife's my friend!

695
01:06:32,133 --> 01:06:34,658
Liar! Evil slut!

696
01:06:43,478 --> 01:06:48,575
Miro, you don't believe
that bitch, do you?

697
01:06:49,484 --> 01:06:54,820
Man, how many jobs have
we pulled off together?

698
01:06:55,290 --> 01:06:57,383
And our agreement!

699
01:06:57,592 --> 01:07:01,119
Clia, see if you can't keep
your man around the house.

700
01:07:01,329 --> 01:07:03,422
I don't want him pestering
me in the street anymore.

701
01:07:07,702 --> 01:07:09,670
Miro!

702
01:07:13,308 --> 01:07:14,297
Miro...

703
01:07:14,509 --> 01:07:18,070
Bastard! You dirty bastard!
You've never fooled me...

704
01:07:18,279 --> 01:07:21,442
I always knew you
had a crush on her.

705
01:07:21,649 --> 01:07:24,049
Can't even respect your best
friens wife, you dog!

706
01:07:24,252 --> 01:07:27,119
- Calm down.
- Dog!

707
01:07:30,925 --> 01:07:33,723
Miro, I'm telling
you the truth!

708
01:07:42,236 --> 01:07:45,933
I lost my friend and partner.
The first robbery without him...

709
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:48,267
there were so many cops, Doctor,
it looked more like...

710
01:07:48,476 --> 01:07:51,274
- a military parade.
- What about him?

711
01:07:51,479 --> 01:07:54,107
I only found out when
he arrived here.

712
01:07:54,315 --> 01:07:58,251
I thought I'd gone to hell,
Doctor, but him?

713
01:07:58,853 --> 01:08:01,981
Come here, come on.

714
01:08:05,693 --> 01:08:07,991
Come here.

715
01:08:20,041 --> 01:08:24,774
Miro, don't you think
it 's time you quit?

716
01:08:27,048 --> 01:08:32,145
Take what you've got and start
a decent life someplace else?

717
01:08:32,353 --> 01:08:36,255
Give the kid a better chance.

718
01:09:02,784 --> 01:09:05,685
Stop!
Police!

719
01:09:06,154 --> 01:09:08,884
Party's over, Miro!

720
01:09:09,090 --> 01:09:12,787
I'll cut you in. It 's cheaper
for me to cut you guys in...

721
01:09:12,994 --> 01:09:15,485
than give it to a lawyer.

722
01:09:15,697 --> 01:09:19,326
You don't get it. We're taking
the lot. Everything.

723
01:09:19,534 --> 01:09:22,662
Hand it over, the dough,
come on, quick!

724
01:09:34,482 --> 01:09:39,317
Too bad, a smart guy like you
trusting his own wife.

725
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:43,047
Some guys are born
to be cheated on.

726
01:09:58,372 --> 01:10:01,569
Are you all right?

727
01:10:21,963 --> 01:10:24,193
Doctor...

728
01:10:25,366 --> 01:10:31,601
do small kids remember
everything we do?

729
01:10:33,508 --> 01:10:36,773
No, not a thing.

730
01:10:38,746 --> 01:10:40,577
Doctor...

731
01:10:40,782 --> 01:10:43,774
let him go.

732
01:11:11,946 --> 01:11:17,350
And with you now,
our untamed diva of dance...

733
01:11:17,552 --> 01:11:20,680
the woman who lives in all
thieves' hearts...

734
01:11:20,888 --> 01:11:24,016
here at the Detention Center...

735
01:11:24,225 --> 01:11:30,892
the one and only
Rita Cadillac!

736
01:12:23,885 --> 01:12:25,853
Hello!

737
01:12:26,053 --> 01:12:32,720
I know you all fool around
a lot, right?

738
01:12:35,429 --> 01:12:38,694
But do you take care
of yourselves?

739
01:12:39,834 --> 01:12:44,771
Our friend the doctor
came here today...

740
01:12:44,972 --> 01:12:47,566
and he's taught me enough
to teach you, too, right?

741
01:12:47,975 --> 01:12:49,909
That 's right!

742
01:12:50,111 --> 01:12:54,104
Okay, so some of you are
careful, and others forget...

743
01:12:54,315 --> 01:12:58,411
so I'm going to teach you
what to do.

744
01:13:09,363 --> 01:13:11,627
This one's orange!

745
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:26,492
Dona Graa,
Ebony sent you this.

746
01:14:26,695 --> 01:14:28,754
Thanks.

747
01:14:30,166 --> 01:14:32,930
Oh, look, my man!
Want some?

748
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:34,830
No, thank you.

749
01:14:35,037 --> 01:14:37,904
See, Franci,
that 's the sort of man I want.

750
01:14:38,107 --> 01:14:40,371
Tell me, you think Deusdete
will like me?

751
01:14:40,576 --> 01:14:41,565
That 's up to the two of you.

752
01:14:41,777 --> 01:14:44,769
It 's easier for him if he has a
sweetheart waiting on the outside.

753
01:14:45,114 --> 01:14:49,881
You're right. You need a heart full
of love to put up with this life.

754
01:14:50,085 --> 01:14:54,522
Take my boy, he's always
asking about his father.

755
01:14:54,723 --> 01:14:57,055
What did he say when you
told him I was coming?

756
01:14:57,259 --> 01:14:59,227
That you could come
if you felt like it.

757
01:15:14,877 --> 01:15:16,742
Good work, man.

758
01:16:18,307 --> 01:16:24,610
Agenor Barbosa, Inmate 15027,
your brothers Pedro, Luls...

759
01:16:24,813 --> 01:16:28,214
and Fellclo are waitlng
foryou at the barbershop.

760
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:30,851
Deusdete, this is Catarina
I told you about.

761
01:16:31,887 --> 01:16:34,253
This is me.

762
01:16:35,324 --> 01:16:37,155
Franci's told me a lot about you.

763
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:38,924
Nothing good, I hope!

764
01:16:39,128 --> 01:16:41,221
Only the best.
She was even a bit jealous...

765
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:45,594
when I said I wanted to meet you,
right Franci?

766
01:16:50,906 --> 01:16:52,874
Zico.

767
01:16:53,976 --> 01:16:56,444
Hi, Franci.

768
01:16:59,882 --> 01:17:03,682
Wow, you're so thin.
Been eating too much junk?

769
01:17:03,886 --> 01:17:07,788
Sure thing. But that 's the least
of it, right Zico?

770
01:17:10,659 --> 01:17:13,253
Son, have you been taking
good care of your brother?

771
01:17:15,364 --> 01:17:17,059
You bet, Godmother!

772
01:17:17,833 --> 01:17:22,395
The game's starting, the referee
blows the whistle...

773
01:17:22,605 --> 01:17:27,201
and they're off! There goes Neto,
and he's through...

774
01:17:27,409 --> 01:17:32,403
to the penalty area, playing
beautifully, passing one player...

775
01:17:32,615 --> 01:17:34,810
dribbling that ball, and Highness
takes a shot...

776
01:17:35,017 --> 01:17:40,819
Inmate Josu 'HIghness'Santos,
Sectlon 9302...

777
01:17:41,023 --> 01:17:44,686
come Immedlately to the entrance
of Pavlllon 9.

778
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:56,301
Darling...

779
01:17:57,373 --> 01:18:00,206
I'll be right back.

780
01:18:00,776 --> 01:18:06,043
Joel Flrmlno and hls wlfe, Luclnda,
please come to the loudspeakers...

781
01:18:06,248 --> 01:18:09,149
where your lost son
Is waitlng foryou.

782
01:18:29,238 --> 01:18:30,296
Hi, honey!

783
01:18:30,506 --> 01:18:33,339
Kiss me on the mouth!

784
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:40,075
Oh honey,
today's not a good day.

785
01:18:40,282 --> 01:18:43,649
The boiler burst and the guy said
I've got to fix it by tonight.

786
01:18:43,852 --> 01:18:45,820
Look here, Highness, you haven't
worked a day in your life.

787
01:18:46,021 --> 01:18:49,957
You're not going to tell me
you've turned over a new leaf!

788
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:52,093
You've got that white
trash in there!

789
01:18:52,294 --> 01:18:53,556
No way, I swear!
Where did you get that idea?!

790
01:18:53,762 --> 01:18:55,627
Really?
So let 's go and take a look!

791
01:18:55,831 --> 01:18:59,198
'Cause I think that white
slut is in there with you!

792
01:18:59,401 --> 01:19:02,564
Get out of my way!

793
01:19:05,074 --> 01:19:10,671
Do you think I'm stupid, an idiot?!
I know she's in there!

794
01:19:10,879 --> 01:19:15,543
I know, you can't get rid of her!

795
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:19,050
What are you looking at?!

796
01:19:21,957 --> 01:19:26,417
There! I just knew you
were with that whore!

797
01:19:26,628 --> 01:19:28,596
Oh, so now I'm the whore,
am I?

798
01:19:28,797 --> 01:19:32,324
Stop, stop!

799
01:19:32,534 --> 01:19:34,399
Go on, Son.

800
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:38,039
Sit down, Dalva.

801
01:19:39,208 --> 01:19:44,202
Rosirene, sit down.

802
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:54,920
Right, now you're here,
there's no turning back.

803
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:58,287
The three of us are going
to come to an agreement.

804
01:19:58,494 --> 01:20:01,657
Rosirene, Dalva's no whore,
all right?

805
01:20:01,864 --> 01:20:05,732
She works at the textile factory
and raises our kids.

806
01:20:05,934 --> 01:20:09,165
They're my kids, damn it!

807
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:15,838
And you, too, you said
Rosirene's won'thless...

808
01:20:16,044 --> 01:20:17,636
and that 's not true, either.

809
01:20:17,846 --> 01:20:21,612
If it werert for her bringing
me some decent stuff...

810
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:26,584
to sell in here, we'd
all be going hungry.

811
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:32,085
If you like both of us,
that 's your problem.

812
01:20:32,294 --> 01:20:33,283
Oh, Jesus!

813
01:20:33,629 --> 01:20:36,621
Yeah, Highness...

814
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:40,233
you're going to have to choose
between us, right now.

815
01:20:42,037 --> 01:20:44,005
Damn right!

816
01:20:50,712 --> 01:20:55,809
Shit, you're breaking
my heart in two, damn it!

817
01:21:03,892 --> 01:21:08,955
Two women, Doctor! What do these
crooks have that we haven't?

818
01:21:09,431 --> 01:21:11,922
Have you kissed your
wife today, Mr. Pires?

819
01:21:12,134 --> 01:21:15,035
No, why?

820
01:21:15,237 --> 01:21:17,262
I rest my case.

821
01:21:29,651 --> 01:21:32,814
Can I join you?

822
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:47,096
So, nothing to tell?

823
01:21:47,302 --> 01:21:50,794
You're the one never told us
what happened that day.

824
01:21:51,006 --> 01:21:54,567
That 's ancient history, Zico.

825
01:21:54,776 --> 01:21:58,576
You never told me what
they did to you!

826
01:22:14,329 --> 01:22:18,698
When you get out of here, promise
me you'll let your hair grow?

827
01:22:23,205 --> 01:22:26,766
You believe in promises?!

828
01:22:30,512 --> 01:22:33,538
Deusdete was right...

829
01:22:33,749 --> 01:22:37,014
you're not the Zico
we used to know.

830
01:23:06,181 --> 01:23:08,672
Anyone home?

831
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:12,483
What 's up, Dagger?

832
01:23:15,090 --> 01:23:17,558
I've got a message for a friend.

833
01:23:17,759 --> 01:23:20,159
I know.

834
01:24:12,948 --> 01:24:16,281
What 's that look on your face?

835
01:24:16,485 --> 01:24:20,114
I pretended I had AIDS,
so they'd leave me alone...

836
01:24:20,322 --> 01:24:24,986
but it was no use. The bastard
who did me is infected.

837
01:24:25,527 --> 01:24:30,021
Forget it, kid, he told me
to tell you he lied, too.

838
01:24:30,232 --> 01:24:33,395
He hasn't got AIDS, either.

839
01:24:38,673 --> 01:24:40,004
What is it?

840
01:24:40,208 --> 01:24:42,369
Ezequiel wants to pay.

841
01:24:42,577 --> 01:24:45,341
You don't owe me anything, man.

842
01:24:45,547 --> 01:24:47,845
Ezequiel spoke to her
and she said yes.

843
01:24:52,654 --> 01:24:54,281
I don't get it.

844
01:24:54,489 --> 01:24:58,425
Ezequiel wants to pay with her.
Ezequiel's sister sleeps with...

845
01:24:58,627 --> 01:25:02,825
some of the guys, raises some
cash and pays the debt with Zico.

846
01:25:03,965 --> 01:25:06,365
Ezequiel has no other possessions.

847
01:25:11,873 --> 01:25:15,400
Do whatever you think's best.

848
01:25:23,018 --> 01:25:27,478
I was blind, I believed her.

849
01:25:29,191 --> 01:25:31,887
Will you ever...

850
01:25:32,094 --> 01:25:34,221
be able to trust me again?

851
01:25:36,098 --> 01:25:38,362
I never stopped trusting you.

852
01:25:46,408 --> 01:25:49,468
He's our family now.

853
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:57,684
Let 's sing "Happy Birthday"!

854
01:25:57,886 --> 01:26:00,377
Here, sit on my lap.

855
01:26:02,190 --> 01:26:06,991
Happy blrthday to you...

856
01:26:12,901 --> 01:26:18,737
Sir, we're in love. Lady and
I would like your blessing.

857
01:26:19,808 --> 01:26:23,266
It 's Dirceu. His name is Dirceu.

858
01:26:26,815 --> 01:26:31,411
Son, do you believe in him?

859
01:26:32,454 --> 01:26:36,288
Mother, I've never met
anyone like Matias.

860
01:26:37,559 --> 01:26:39,686
I don't get this kid.

861
01:26:46,768 --> 01:26:50,829
We're too old to know
what 's right, Antnio.

862
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:55,339
If it 's what Dirceu wants,
what 's the harm?

863
01:26:55,610 --> 01:27:00,411
In here they can get up to all
the disgusting things they like.

864
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:08,117
Son...

865
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:13,789
bye!

866
01:27:14,663 --> 01:27:18,531
Your attentlon, please!
Vlsitors Day Is almost over...

867
01:27:18,733 --> 01:27:22,191
so wlll famlly members please
go to the exit.

868
01:27:22,404 --> 01:27:26,272
The gates wlll close
In ten mlnutes.

869
01:27:28,210 --> 01:27:31,179
Excuse me, Doctor.
This is my boy.

870
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:34,344
I know he's done wrong...

871
01:27:34,549 --> 01:27:39,077
but when I think of him, I can't
believe he took someone's life.

872
01:27:39,287 --> 01:27:41,847
I want to ask you to keep
an eye on Davilson for me.

873
01:27:42,057 --> 01:27:43,888
I can't look after him in here.

874
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:48,320
Come and see me at the infirmary.

875
01:27:48,530 --> 01:27:51,693
Thank you, Doctor.

876
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:29,332
So, can I come back next time?

877
01:28:29,537 --> 01:28:32,267
If you think it 's won'th it.

878
01:28:32,474 --> 01:28:35,375
It 'll be so long
before I get out.

879
01:28:41,449 --> 01:28:43,883
I'm in no hurry.

880
01:28:56,865 --> 01:29:01,700
Mr. Pires, his body was already
hanging here when we woke up.

881
01:29:09,444 --> 01:29:13,073
This one won't be raping
anyone else.

882
01:29:29,631 --> 01:29:31,861
The Doctor said it should
read positive.

883
01:29:32,067 --> 01:29:36,367
No! Positive means you've
got it in your blood!

884
01:29:36,571 --> 01:29:40,234
It has to be negative.

885
01:29:40,442 --> 01:29:43,434
HIV-negative.

886
01:29:47,048 --> 01:29:51,007
I'll go first; my case
is more desperate.

887
01:30:02,797 --> 01:30:05,561
I'm clean!

888
01:30:07,435 --> 01:30:09,733
I'm clean!

889
01:30:19,948 --> 01:30:26,046
Well, you've had your fun,
had over 2,OOO men...

890
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:27,482
and you're clean.

891
01:30:27,689 --> 01:30:30,681
And me, as square as they come?
It 's just too bad.

892
01:30:38,666 --> 01:30:42,193
I'm clean too, Lady.

893
01:30:52,213 --> 01:30:53,908
What 's wrong?

894
01:30:59,254 --> 01:31:02,746
"TOO BAD"

895
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:08,623
They're letting me out, Lady.

896
01:31:14,302 --> 01:31:17,965
So why aren't you happy?

897
01:31:19,407 --> 01:31:23,366
And leave you here all alone?

898
01:31:24,913 --> 01:31:28,110
I'm not alone.

899
01:31:38,426 --> 01:31:41,088
I have you.

900
01:31:54,843 --> 01:31:58,142
No one works for me
who can't be trusted.

901
01:31:59,214 --> 01:32:01,512
You ask permission to kill,
then change your mind?

902
01:32:01,950 --> 01:32:05,408
But Ebony, I'll be
out in two years.

903
01:32:05,620 --> 01:32:08,282
Better keep quiet and settle the
score on the outside, right?

904
01:32:09,991 --> 01:32:12,255
Ezequiel...

905
01:32:12,494 --> 01:32:15,588
you owed and didn't pay.

906
01:32:15,797 --> 01:32:18,789
You're alive,
but you can't stay here.

907
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,764
Get your things and
go to the yellow wing.

908
01:32:24,105 --> 01:32:26,403
As for you, Zico...

909
01:32:26,608 --> 01:32:28,473
you're no criminal.

910
01:32:28,676 --> 01:32:31,736
You're a clown.

911
01:33:14,789 --> 01:33:16,882
It 's all right, Doctor.

912
01:33:17,091 --> 01:33:18,854
So many years locked up...

913
01:33:19,060 --> 01:33:23,429
the mind learns to control
the body.

914
01:33:42,317 --> 01:33:45,081
Chico, how come you're in here?

915
01:33:45,286 --> 01:33:48,119
Oh, Doctor, you want to hear
yet another lie?

916
01:33:48,323 --> 01:33:52,521
No one in here is really guilty,
haven't you noticed?

917
01:33:52,961 --> 01:33:55,054
Much longer to go?

918
01:33:55,263 --> 01:33:59,097
I should have been out long ago.
It 's in the hands of the judge.

919
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:01,860
Oh, Doctor,
I can't wait.

920
01:34:02,070 --> 01:34:04,197
Best thing about jail
is getting out!

921
01:34:04,405 --> 01:34:05,963
And leave behind all
your friends, Chico?

922
01:34:06,174 --> 01:34:08,904
Friends? I don't want
inmates for friends.

923
01:34:09,110 --> 01:34:12,705
I finish talking to you,
close the door, and that 's that.

924
01:34:12,914 --> 01:34:15,781
In here you have to walk alone...

925
01:34:15,984 --> 01:34:18,817
or maybe with God.

926
01:34:20,855 --> 01:34:24,222
What about your daughter?

927
01:34:28,696 --> 01:34:31,893
What are you thinking, Chico?

928
01:34:32,634 --> 01:34:37,697
I was imagining these two...

929
01:34:37,905 --> 01:34:41,068
flying up...

930
01:34:41,275 --> 01:34:43,641
higher into the sky.

931
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:01,321
It 's weird.

932
01:35:02,897 --> 01:35:05,388
This is weird!

933
01:35:09,704 --> 01:35:12,537
Weird.

934
01:35:17,045 --> 01:35:19,809
Come out, you son of a bitch!

935
01:35:20,014 --> 01:35:21,606
Come out!

936
01:35:28,022 --> 01:35:29,956
What can you see?

937
01:35:30,158 --> 01:35:32,285
It 's trying to stab me in the eye!

938
01:35:38,733 --> 01:35:41,566
Want to stab me?

939
01:35:41,769 --> 01:35:44,101
Son of a bitch!

940
01:35:48,009 --> 01:35:52,139
There's no one there, man. Jesus,
brother, you're too crazy, Zico.

941
01:35:52,346 --> 01:35:53,677
It 's me, man!

942
01:35:54,215 --> 01:35:59,881
Give me that knife, Zico.
Come on, give me the knife!

943
01:36:02,790 --> 01:36:03,984
Give me the knife!

944
01:36:04,192 --> 01:36:08,390
Get a grip, Zico. You trying
to get yourself killed?

945
01:36:17,472 --> 01:36:22,739
Stop smoking, Zico.

946
01:36:23,611 --> 01:36:26,580
I don't want
that shit in here anymore!

947
01:36:41,529 --> 01:36:44,259
So Mr. Pires, shall I go
and fetch the old man?

948
01:36:44,465 --> 01:36:47,992
No, let him be.

949
01:37:51,399 --> 01:37:54,300
Look, Ebony, I know that
when I went to visit Zico...

950
01:37:54,502 --> 01:37:56,834
Deusdete didn't let us
do crack in there.

951
01:37:57,038 --> 01:37:59,097
That 's no reason
to kill like a coward!

952
01:37:59,307 --> 01:38:03,141
I was scared shitless.
Went to bed and woke up burned!

953
01:38:03,344 --> 01:38:05,835
How dare he kill without
asking us?

954
01:38:06,514 --> 01:38:08,106
Mind your own business.

955
01:38:08,316 --> 01:38:12,412
He was a childhood friend. If you
had a friend to advise you...

956
01:38:12,620 --> 01:38:15,111
would you have done
the same thing to him?

957
01:38:15,323 --> 01:38:16,756
That 's their problem!

958
01:38:16,958 --> 01:38:20,917
You're wrong.
Now it 's our problem.

959
01:38:22,363 --> 01:38:24,456
Here she comes!

960
01:39:10,645 --> 01:39:13,705
Too Bad, honey...

961
01:39:13,915 --> 01:39:16,076
do you take Lady
as your true wife?

962
01:39:17,418 --> 01:39:19,283
Yes.

963
01:39:22,456 --> 01:39:26,392
And do you, Lady,
take Too Bad as your husband?

964
01:39:29,730 --> 01:39:31,527
I do.

965
01:39:36,037 --> 01:39:37,732
Then as the presiding queen...

966
01:39:37,939 --> 01:39:41,033
I hereby declare you man...

967
01:39:41,242 --> 01:39:43,676
and wife!

968
01:40:03,531 --> 01:40:06,864
Kiss! Kiss!

969
01:40:07,068 --> 01:40:09,263
First I want to propose
a toast...

970
01:40:09,470 --> 01:40:12,633
to the Doctor!

971
01:40:14,008 --> 01:40:16,442
Because thanks to all the
medicine this gentleman...

972
01:40:16,644 --> 01:40:21,274
has taught me, I'm going out
to open my own clinic.

973
01:40:24,385 --> 01:40:27,684
While I wait for you,
my beauty...

974
01:40:27,888 --> 01:40:31,415
so we can start our own family.

975
01:40:32,593 --> 01:40:37,257
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

976
01:41:03,858 --> 01:41:05,917
Highness?

977
01:41:06,427 --> 01:41:08,725
Can't I have some on account?

978
01:41:10,097 --> 01:41:12,691
What the fuck?!

979
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:15,632
Son of a bitch!

980
01:42:00,047 --> 01:42:01,571
Jesus, he chickened out!

981
01:42:06,487 --> 01:42:08,455
Ezequiel...

982
01:42:08,989 --> 01:42:11,389
come here!

983
01:42:12,493 --> 01:42:15,087
Come here, Ezequiel!

984
01:42:36,383 --> 01:42:41,116
Hey, Ezequiel, you think
that bastard Zico...

985
01:42:41,322 --> 01:42:44,985
is to blame
for all your misery, right?

986
01:42:45,192 --> 01:42:50,459
Sure, but Ezequiel's life has
always been miserable.

987
01:42:52,633 --> 01:42:58,333
And wasrt it Zico made Ezequiel
offer his sister for the drugs?

988
01:42:58,539 --> 01:43:02,498
Sure, what was I supposed to do?

989
01:43:03,744 --> 01:43:07,510
So forget it, you did it.

990
01:43:07,715 --> 01:43:11,776
Ezequiel stabbed Zico,
over 3O times.

991
01:43:14,321 --> 01:43:16,653
But Highness...

992
01:43:17,858 --> 01:43:21,089
Ezequiel will be
out in just two years.

993
01:43:21,896 --> 01:43:23,591
If I do that I'll get another twenty!

994
01:43:23,797 --> 01:43:27,961
Two years, twenty years, what 's the
difference to Ezequiel?

995
01:43:28,169 --> 01:43:30,603
Ezequiel has AIDS.

996
01:43:30,804 --> 01:43:36,640
At least you'll get a cell
to yourself, laundry...

997
01:43:36,844 --> 01:43:40,575
and of course, crack to smoke.

998
01:44:15,983 --> 01:44:19,077
I was the one wiped out Zico.

999
01:44:19,954 --> 01:44:23,082
Now I don't owe anyone a thing.

1000
01:45:31,392 --> 01:45:33,326
Old man?

1001
01:45:34,461 --> 01:45:37,123
Go in peace.

1002
01:45:37,898 --> 01:45:42,995
Keep it, you need all the peace
you can get in there.

1003
01:46:05,024 --> 01:46:08,187
Why didn't you knife me?

1004
01:46:10,663 --> 01:46:14,224
I couldn't!
What about him?

1005
01:46:14,433 --> 01:46:18,893
He won't leave me alone,
follows me everywhere.

1006
01:46:19,105 --> 01:46:21,972
So, Zico, up in heaven,
did you meet anyone?

1007
01:46:22,608 --> 01:46:26,044
No one you know, just him.

1008
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:31,507
No, Zico, what about God?

1009
01:46:35,388 --> 01:46:39,222
Not God in person,
haven't seen Him yet.

1010
01:47:28,507 --> 01:47:30,737
What 's wrong?

1011
01:47:30,943 --> 01:47:36,540
Doctor, how can you tell whether
you're going mad?

1012
01:47:37,249 --> 01:47:39,979
Zico came back...

1013
01:47:40,186 --> 01:47:42,848
to haunt me
because I couldn't kill him.

1014
01:47:43,055 --> 01:47:46,547
You been seeing ghosts,
Dagger?

1015
01:47:46,759 --> 01:47:52,197
A guy like me,
unable to kill?

1016
01:47:53,132 --> 01:47:56,590
Never happened before!

1017
01:47:56,802 --> 01:47:58,793
Isn't that a good thing?

1018
01:47:59,004 --> 01:48:02,235
I only know how to kill.

1019
01:48:02,741 --> 01:48:05,642
That 's how I grew up.

1020
01:48:05,845 --> 01:48:06,834
We change, Dagger.

1021
01:48:07,279 --> 01:48:13,479
Doctor, I have to know what 's
happening to me, Doctor!

1022
01:48:13,686 --> 01:48:16,655
Am I no longer myself?!

1023
01:48:17,156 --> 01:48:19,647
Maybe it 's your guilt over
having killed so many.

1024
01:48:24,697 --> 01:48:26,961
Doctor...

1025
01:48:29,034 --> 01:48:31,525
is there a cure for guilt?

1026
01:48:36,408 --> 01:48:39,468
If there were,
everyone would want some.

1027
01:49:32,698 --> 01:49:33,960
Father.

1028
01:50:22,881 --> 01:50:25,076
Enter, Brother.

1029
01:50:27,286 --> 01:50:29,151
Come!

1030
01:50:31,190 --> 01:50:32,555
Come!

1031
01:50:32,758 --> 01:50:34,919
Did you know the Lord
has a plan for you?

1032
01:50:37,396 --> 01:50:38,454
Enter!

1033
01:50:38,831 --> 01:50:41,800
This is your home.

1034
01:50:44,970 --> 01:50:46,801
You are lost, Brother.

1035
01:50:47,006 --> 01:50:50,965
You don't know it,
but it was He who brought you here.

1036
01:50:53,012 --> 01:50:54,001
Who, Father?

1037
01:50:54,213 --> 01:50:59,446
Jesus! He knows you can't sleep
if you haven't harmed someone...

1038
01:50:59,918 --> 01:51:04,184
that you have sleepless nights
unless you've thrown a man down.

1039
01:51:04,523 --> 01:51:06,150
Isn't that what it 's like
every day, Brother?

1040
01:51:06,358 --> 01:51:09,759
Come on, isn't it?

1041
01:51:09,962 --> 01:51:12,192
Yes, Father!

1042
01:51:12,765 --> 01:51:14,699
Yes it is!

1043
01:51:15,067 --> 01:51:17,535
There is so much blood on me,
Father!

1044
01:51:18,137 --> 01:51:22,699
So, Brother, kneel down.
Come on, kneel down!

1045
01:51:22,908 --> 01:51:28,039
Will you accept Jesus?
Will you accept Jesus?

1046
01:51:28,614 --> 01:51:32,550
Well, Brother,
will you accept Jesus?!

1047
01:51:35,354 --> 01:51:38,983
Which of you has accepted Jesus?

1048
01:51:39,191 --> 01:51:40,783
Hallelujah!

1049
01:51:40,993 --> 01:51:44,485
Hallelujah!

1050
01:51:47,166 --> 01:51:49,430
Criminals of Brazil...

1051
01:51:49,635 --> 01:51:55,096
the big day is here,
the Pavilion 9 finals!

1052
01:51:55,307 --> 01:51:57,400
Marsh going
for the trophy with...

1053
01:51:57,609 --> 01:51:59,941
Vallent, Samuel,
Dad, Saint...

1054
01:52:00,145 --> 01:52:04,206
Indian Boa Ventura, Minimum Wage,
Valdir, ARI5...

1055
01:52:04,416 --> 01:52:07,544
Hildo Ribeiro and Gerer!

1056
01:52:09,355 --> 01:52:11,687
Tornado 2000
Is here with...

1057
01:52:11,890 --> 01:52:14,688
Little Eye, Sleeve,
White Feather, Grlngo...

1058
01:52:15,027 --> 01:52:20,431
Salomo Ayala, Ed Murphy,
Greenouse Joe, Zelo, Flavino...

1059
01:52:20,632 --> 01:52:23,726
Ebony Ten and Tafarel!

1060
01:54:21,086 --> 01:54:24,021
To kick off this glorious
sporting event...

1061
01:54:24,223 --> 01:54:29,160
none other than our healer,
the wizard of medicinal alchemy...

1062
01:54:29,361 --> 01:54:33,024
and official trainer of the
criminal classes!

1063
01:54:46,712 --> 01:54:52,014
And they're off! Saint passes
to ARI5,Dad covering him...

1064
01:54:52,217 --> 01:54:56,916
Marsh on the attack!
Forcing the ball back...

1065
01:54:57,122 --> 01:54:58,919
Into the hands of Tafarel.

1066
01:54:59,124 --> 01:55:03,356
Up goes the ball! And it's out...

1067
01:55:21,513 --> 01:55:22,741
So, Beard, you all right?

1068
01:55:22,948 --> 01:55:27,214
Couldn't be better.
Have a good weekend.

1069
01:55:27,686 --> 01:55:29,847
Unfortunately,
The Beard was wrong.

1070
01:55:30,055 --> 01:55:33,957
He needed some of old Chico's
wisdom, who once said to me:

1071
01:55:34,159 --> 01:55:39,859
'A quiet, obedient jail?
Sure sign of trouble.'

1072
01:55:40,399 --> 01:55:43,368
Two weeks later,
when I got back...

1073
01:55:43,569 --> 01:55:46,436
there were nothing but bullet
holes covering the walls.

1074
01:55:53,512 --> 01:55:55,673
Hey, you!
Go find your own line.

1075
01:55:55,881 --> 01:55:58,509
I'll use this one.

1076
01:56:01,353 --> 01:56:02,980
Go away!

1077
01:56:07,759 --> 01:56:08,748
Are you crazy, man?!

1078
01:56:08,961 --> 01:56:10,189
So let me dry my clothes!

1079
01:56:10,395 --> 01:56:11,657
You've got some nerve, man!

1080
01:56:11,863 --> 01:56:14,161
What's it got to do with you?

1081
01:56:14,366 --> 01:56:15,628
Stop!

1082
01:56:16,501 --> 01:56:18,435
Stop, or I shoot!

1083
01:56:20,138 --> 01:56:23,767
Some say it started because of
a debt for five packs of cigarettes.

1084
01:56:23,976 --> 01:56:27,537
Others that it was a fight over
the soccer game.

1085
01:56:27,746 --> 01:56:30,874
One or two say it was about
a pair of underpants.

1086
01:56:31,083 --> 01:56:36,180
Like they say,
"Jail's no home for the truth".

1087
01:56:37,522 --> 01:56:40,355
And Dad's down, it's a penalty!

1088
01:56:40,559 --> 01:56:45,656
Penalty for Marsh one minute
before the end!

1089
01:56:45,864 --> 01:56:49,425
The referee's surrounded, and he's
sending a playeroff!

1090
01:56:49,635 --> 01:56:52,069
Dad's taking the penalty himself.

1091
01:56:52,270 --> 01:56:54,568
Getting ready...

1092
01:56:55,007 --> 01:56:57,908
concentrating.

1093
01:56:58,110 --> 01:57:00,738
Go on, Dad!

1094
01:57:00,946 --> 01:57:03,779
Goal!!!

1095
01:57:13,458 --> 01:57:15,892
Jesus Christ!

1096
01:57:16,094 --> 01:57:18,392
Watch out,
Rabbit 's gang is coming!

1097
01:57:22,267 --> 01:57:23,928
Just look what you did to him.

1098
01:57:24,136 --> 01:57:27,162
- Greedy bastard!
- Could have used your hand, man!

1099
01:57:27,372 --> 01:57:30,341
Just over a pair of underpants,
Jesus!

1100
01:57:32,344 --> 01:57:34,039
Why couldn't you have waited?

1101
01:57:34,246 --> 01:57:39,684
- What 's it got to do with you?
- Go fuck yourself, damn it!

1102
01:57:40,419 --> 01:57:42,910
Fucking asshole!

1103
01:57:47,859 --> 01:57:50,123
We're the champions!

1104
01:58:05,077 --> 01:58:07,409
I was scared, Doctor!

1105
01:58:07,612 --> 01:58:11,241
All hell broke loose, and
when the blood boils...

1106
01:58:11,450 --> 01:58:13,975
criminals lose all control.

1107
01:58:14,186 --> 01:58:19,385
With the confusion, I could
easily have got hurt badly.

1108
01:58:26,031 --> 01:58:29,467
Sound the alarm!
Riot in nine!

1109
01:58:29,868 --> 01:58:32,234
The place is ours!
We're locked in!

1110
01:58:32,571 --> 01:58:36,632
Forget it, let them die if they
want. Let 's get to our cell!

1111
01:58:48,787 --> 01:58:51,915
The war's started!

1112
01:59:02,634 --> 01:59:05,762
War! Let 's torch the place!

1113
01:59:09,407 --> 01:59:10,704
Go on!

1114
01:59:34,599 --> 01:59:39,036
Another explosion in the
overcrowded Detention Center...

1115
01:59:39,237 --> 01:59:41,398
which is the biggest
In Latin America...

1116
01:59:41,606 --> 01:59:44,336
with a total capacity
of 4,000 Inmates.

1117
01:59:44,543 --> 01:59:50,709
0nly nowadays it's more crowded
than ever, with 7,500 prisoners!

1118
01:59:51,516 --> 01:59:54,349
The riot squad has been called
and is storming the jail-

1119
01:59:54,553 --> 02:00:00,150
over 300 men with revolvers,
machine guns and tear gas.

1120
02:00:00,592 --> 02:00:03,686
By then, no one could
hear a damn thing.

1121
02:00:03,895 --> 02:00:07,387
Through the bars we could see
a bunch of masked cops.

1122
02:00:07,599 --> 02:00:11,330
All you could see was their eyes,
the dogs, machine guns...

1123
02:00:11,536 --> 02:00:16,439
and an helicopter flying real low,
pointing a machine gun at us.

1124
02:01:17,302 --> 02:01:19,463
Certainly, sir, right away!

1125
02:01:19,671 --> 02:01:24,108
Orders from the governor...
you're in charge now, Colonel.

1126
02:01:24,309 --> 02:01:26,334
The troops are here to do
whatever's necessary.

1127
02:01:26,544 --> 02:01:30,241
You're an experienced man.
If you need to move in, go ahead.

1128
02:01:30,448 --> 02:01:33,440
No, I can't accept that!
This is my jail!

1129
02:01:36,855 --> 02:01:39,221
Squad... attention!

1130
02:01:39,424 --> 02:01:43,258
Pay attention, men!
Return to your cells!

1131
02:01:43,461 --> 02:01:46,021
Back to your cells, otherwise
the cops are coming in!

1132
02:01:46,231 --> 02:01:48,096
If they come in here,
they'll all die!

1133
02:01:48,533 --> 02:01:53,266
Mr. Pires, plenty of men should
have been released by now!

1134
02:01:53,872 --> 02:01:58,036
We want better conditions!

1135
02:01:58,243 --> 02:02:00,734
Mr. Pires, send the riot
squad away!

1136
02:02:00,946 --> 02:02:03,005
So go back to your cells!

1137
02:02:03,214 --> 02:02:05,375
Everyone back to his cell,
or you'll regret it!

1138
02:02:06,017 --> 02:02:08,349
No regrets in here!

1139
02:02:08,553 --> 02:02:10,612
How many hostages do you have?

1140
02:02:10,822 --> 02:02:13,052
Are there hostages in there?

1141
02:02:13,258 --> 02:02:14,987
We've no hostages, Mr. Pires!

1142
02:02:15,360 --> 02:02:17,658
This is our fight, Mr. Pires!

1143
02:02:18,330 --> 02:02:22,289
See, Colonel, they've no hostages,
no water, no electricity!

1144
02:02:22,500 --> 02:02:23,694
They can't hold out for long!

1145
02:02:23,902 --> 02:02:25,494
Save us, Mr. Pires!

1146
02:02:25,704 --> 02:02:28,400
Don't let them come in here.
Send the riot squad away!

1147
02:02:29,274 --> 02:02:31,242
I'm having a tough time
holding them back!

1148
02:02:31,443 --> 02:02:35,243
Let 's keep calm!

1149
02:02:35,447 --> 02:02:37,381
Now hand over your weapons!

1150
02:02:37,582 --> 02:02:39,743
Surrender your weapons!

1151
02:03:21,292 --> 02:03:26,389
See, Colonel? Everything's calm.
You can send them away.

1152
02:03:27,298 --> 02:03:31,667
Pay attention!
Everyone back to your cells!

1153
02:03:31,870 --> 02:03:34,031
Return to your cells!

1154
02:03:35,473 --> 02:03:38,033
Let 's stay calm!

1155
02:03:38,243 --> 02:03:41,872
Back to your cells!

1156
02:03:46,317 --> 02:03:48,012
With an election coming up...

1157
02:03:48,219 --> 02:03:49,982
the governor wasn't going to
let the jail explode.

1158
02:04:40,505 --> 02:04:41,631
You!

1159
02:04:42,173 --> 02:04:43,936
Show us the way, let 's go.

1160
02:04:53,551 --> 02:04:58,250
We may be a bunch of ignorant
thieves and murderers...

1161
02:04:58,389 --> 02:05:02,917
but we're not stupid.
No one wants to die.

1162
02:05:03,128 --> 02:05:07,155
We ran to our cells.
We couldn't put up a fight...

1163
02:05:07,365 --> 02:05:09,799
with knives and sticks.

1164
02:05:23,615 --> 02:05:26,482
Go back, I'm warning you, we've
all got AIDS! You're gonna die!

1165
02:05:32,257 --> 02:05:37,320
They came in to kill us, Doctor,
shouting we all had AIDS...

1166
02:05:37,529 --> 02:05:39,554
that they'd catch
it if they touched us.

1167
02:06:17,135 --> 02:06:19,126
Shit, I don't want to die!

1168
02:06:19,337 --> 02:06:22,864
Hey, get out!

1169
02:06:24,209 --> 02:06:25,471
Let me through!

1170
02:06:32,483 --> 02:06:33,472
Open the fuck up!

1171
02:07:55,833 --> 02:07:58,393
Sergeant, let 's play
cops and robbers!

1172
02:08:08,079 --> 02:08:10,070
Open! Open up!

1173
02:08:22,894 --> 02:08:25,294
They're killing everyone!

1174
02:08:39,677 --> 02:08:43,078
You're going to live
to tell the tale.

1175
02:08:54,926 --> 02:08:56,985
I changed my mind.

1176
02:09:23,187 --> 02:09:24,950
Like hell he changed his mind!

1177
02:09:25,156 --> 02:09:28,683
It was pure spite. He only fed
Ezequiel a glimmer of hope...

1178
02:09:28,893 --> 02:09:30,383
just so he could come
back and kill him.

1179
02:09:34,465 --> 02:09:36,228
You two been causing trouble?

1180
02:09:36,434 --> 02:09:39,733
No way, we're sports fans.

1181
02:09:49,680 --> 02:09:53,013
So, you thief, how do you like
some of your own medicine!

1182
02:09:53,217 --> 02:09:54,980
You got lucky this time.

1183
02:10:44,235 --> 02:10:46,362
Who knows?

1184
02:10:46,571 --> 02:10:49,233
I guess he didn't have the courage
to shoot a woman.

1185
02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:51,965
It was our love that saved us.

1186
02:11:02,720 --> 02:11:09,284
It was the cop's son who saved my
life. God bless the cop's son!

1187
02:11:09,494 --> 02:11:11,485
God bless that cop's son!

1188
02:11:12,697 --> 02:11:16,531
- Get out, scum, stand up!
- For God's sake, I'm unarmed!

1189
02:11:17,335 --> 02:11:19,064
Out of your cell!

1190
02:11:19,270 --> 02:11:20,862
I know you killed a cop!
No fooling me!

1191
02:11:21,172 --> 02:11:26,405
I never killed anyone, sir! I'm only in
for 3 years. Spare me, spare me!

1192
02:11:26,611 --> 02:11:29,774
Listen here, the only reason this
is your lucky day...

1193
02:11:29,981 --> 02:11:32,415
is because you look like my son.

1194
02:13:17,588 --> 02:13:23,652
Anyone alive, undress
and come out naked!

1195
02:13:23,861 --> 02:13:26,955
Anyone alive, undress
and come out naked!

1196
02:13:37,608 --> 02:13:41,203
I want to hear you say,
"Long live the riot squad!" Go on!

1197
02:13:42,513 --> 02:13:44,276
Long live the riot squad!

1198
02:13:44,482 --> 02:13:48,213
Louder, you murderer!
Long live the riot squad!

1199
02:13:48,419 --> 02:13:49,886
- Long live the riot squad!
- Long live the riot squad!

1200
02:13:50,087 --> 02:13:52,453
Everyone now!
Long live the riot squad!

1201
02:13:52,657 --> 02:13:57,959
- Long live the riot squad!
- Long live the riot squad!

1202
02:14:11,642 --> 02:14:14,770
Lieutenant, the only ones left
inside won't be going anywhere.

1203
02:14:20,951 --> 02:14:25,047
Undress, everything,
come on!

1204
02:14:25,256 --> 02:14:26,848
Heads down!

1205
02:17:17,127 --> 02:17:20,358
Davilson, dear Son...

1206
02:17:20,664 --> 02:17:25,499
your mother weeps when she thinks
of you when you were little...

1207
02:17:25,703 --> 02:17:29,139
laughing deep into my eyes.

1208
02:17:29,707 --> 02:17:33,074
I know you never
believed in my God...

1209
02:17:33,277 --> 02:17:37,543
but today, as I read the Bible,
it was as if you were here...

1210
02:17:37,748 --> 02:17:40,615
in my lap again.

1211
02:17:40,818 --> 02:17:45,517
My heart trembled as
I read salm 91.

1212
02:17:46,056 --> 02:17:48,889
What beautiful words:

1213
02:17:50,961 --> 02:17:56,695
"A thousand may fall
at your right hand...

1214
02:17:56,901 --> 02:18:00,735
but no evil will come near you...

1215
02:18:00,938 --> 02:18:03,099
no scourge come near your tent."

1216
02:18:48,752 --> 02:18:54,054
In the late '80s, AIDS
prevention work in jails...

1217
02:18:54,258 --> 02:18:58,661
took me to the So Paulo
Detention Center. Carandiru.

1218
02:18:58,862 --> 02:19:04,494
There, I heard stories, made real
friends, learned medicine...

1219
02:19:04,702 --> 02:19:08,661
and penetrated a few of the
mysteries of life in jail...

1220
02:19:08,872 --> 02:19:12,273
which would have remained
Inaccessible were I not a doctor.

1221
02:19:22,553 --> 02:19:25,249
- Morning, Doctor.
- Good morning.

1222
02:19:27,424 --> 02:19:30,757
Even today, whenever I hear
the iron gates close behind me...

1223
02:19:30,961 --> 02:19:33,555
I feel that shudder, just like
all those matinees...

1224
02:19:33,764 --> 02:19:36,858
at the Rialto Cinema, where
I'd sit glued to my chair...

1225
02:19:37,067 --> 02:19:40,503
as I watched all those jail films
in black-and-white.

1226
02:19:42,906 --> 02:19:46,239
"On October 2, 1992, 111 men died
at the So Paulo Detention Center.

1227
02:19:46,443 --> 02:19:49,776
There were no police deaths.

1228
02:19:49,980 --> 02:19:53,313
The only ones who know what
really happened are God...

1229
02:19:53,517 --> 02:19:56,850
the police, and the inmates.
I just heard the latter."

1230
02:20:00,157 --> 02:20:03,183
"On September 15, 2OO2, the last
inmates were transferred.

1231
02:20:03,394 --> 02:20:06,420
Once empty,
Carandiru closed its doors."

1232
02:20:28,152 --> 02:20:33,647
"On December 9, Carandiru
was finally demolished."
