CARANDIRU
A FILM BY HECTOR BABENCO

2
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,647
BASED ON THE NOVEL ESTACAO
CARANDIRU BY DRAUZIO VARELLA

3
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,010
I was shocked when I came in.

4
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,161
DRAUZIO VARELLA

5
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,409
I saw the little tables, the people,
the women and children.

6
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,211
It looks like
a normal visiting day.

7
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,803
So let's go and take a look.

8
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,366
In terms of people,
it looks identical.

9
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,367
Do you think I'm stupid, an idiot?

10
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,042
I know she's in there!

11
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,568
What are you looking at?

12
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,046
There!

13
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,601
I just knew you were with that whore.

14
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,969
Oh, so now I'm the whore, am I?

15
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,528
- Listen!
-Stop, stop!

16
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,090
Sit down, Dalva.

17
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,362
You're crazy.

18
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,646
Sit down, please.

19
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,244
Rosirene, sit down.

20
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,767
She throws the bag,
and he is out of the shot.

21
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,765
Then he walks off.

22
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,042
If you like both of us...

23
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,811
...that's your problem.
-Oh, Jesus!

24
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:30,603
Yeah, Highness. You're going to have
to choose between us right now.

25
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,446
Damn right.

26
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,648
I have no right to tell a story like this...

27
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,801
DRAUZIO VARELLA

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,846
...if someone's going to identify
the person I'm talking about.

29
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,044
This guy didn't tell me this story
so I can use it in a book.

30
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,443
He told me because I'm
a doctor and he trusted his doctor.

31
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,447
However, the story should be told,
and it can be very interesting.

32
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,121
You have to find a way
of telling the story...

33
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,330
...so that even the person involved
can't recognize himself if he reads it.

34
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,848
Stay between that tree
and the guard shack.

35
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,041
- Deusdete, this is Catarina.
-Hello.

36
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,770
This is me.

37
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,927
- Franci's told me a lot about you.
-Nothing bad, I hope.

38
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,850
Only the best.

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,289
She was even a bit jealous when
I said I wanted to meet you, right?

40
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,011
Just so I won't need to do that...

41
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,931
That's better.

42
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,491
Zico.

43
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,326
I think we need a two-shot.

44
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,764
The story has
changed so much...

45
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,251
DRAUZIO VARELLA

46
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,842
...it's impossible to separate things.
Hector did the same thing.

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,971
He merged the characters
to create new ones...

48
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,250
...and based the film on all
the stories mixed together.

49
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,610
It's nobody's story anymore.
And the doctor is not really me.

50
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,766
Slow.

51
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,571
Lean on the wall.

52
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,725
He can't spit there.

53
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,451
Tuberculosis. Anyone steps
on that, spreads the disease.

54
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,609
He must be isolated.

55
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,970
But where, doctor?

56
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,243
There are terrible situations...

57
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,050
DOCTOR
LUIZ CARLOS VASCONCELOS

58
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,807
...the doctor has to deal with.
It's been very...

59
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,008
It's been very important...

60
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,051
...to try and understand how
he distanced himself.

61
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,811
In your face.

62
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,010
Doctor, stop bullshitting me...

63
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,602
...l've been in jail for ten years
having plenty of ass.

64
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,531
That's how I got AIDS.
It's as clear as that.

65
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,803
Do you use drugs?

66
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,763
- Needles?
-No way, doctor.

67
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,801
That doesn't mean anything.

68
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,804
Now, looking to the doctor
asking for help...

69
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,883
...that means everything.

70
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,521
Less messing around.

71
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,530
The scene needs something
I'm not seeing. That's the truth.

72
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,765
- Okay.
-Sometimes we emphasize...

73
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,807
...the dramatic aspect too much.
The situation is already tragic.

74
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,483
Why are you coming to the doctor?
Because you are certain...

75
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,122
...you have AIDS.
You want to take the test...

76
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,248
...because there could
still be some hope.

77
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,761
I need to see that in your face.

78
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,891
I need to see it.
It has to come from the heart.

79
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,567
Is it still worth taking the test?

80
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,244
Cut!

81
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,764
That's it.
Excellent work, everybody.

82
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,929
There is no room...

83
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,162
DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY
WALTER CARVALHO

84
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,850
Even if I wanted to...

85
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,522
...there's no room to add
superfluous details to the shots.

86
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,446
There is a very...

87
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,242
...tangible, specific
and real objective...

88
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,770
...as far as what Hector wants from
each sequence and from each shot.

89
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,249
None of Hector's frames
are unnecessary.

90
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,047
Because we were following this...

91
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:33,446
...orientation, we created
the photography you see here.

92
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,246
<i>It was 4 p.m., the day before
yesterday. It was 4 p.m...</i>

93
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,611
Yeah, that's a good place.

94
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,810
That seems natural.

95
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,282
You're hurting. It's biting you.

96
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,284
The trick is in your hand,
not your wrist.

97
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,005
It died?

98
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,723
Like hell it did! So I grabbed it
and stuck my teeth into its brain.

99
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,043
Then ljust brushed my teeth
and that was that.

100
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,806
Easy, man!

101
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,203
God protect you, Lula.
God bless you, God bless you all.

102
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,847
That's enough of God, Highness,
you're not kidding anyone.

103
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,048
What, you married twice?

104
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,726
Well, doctor, to me life's
a merry-go-round...

105
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,008
...and just the one horse
isn't enough.

106
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,083
Scene 47-2, take 3.
Tail slate.

107
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,601
Camera...

108
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,009
...action!

109
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,041
-L'm getting excited.
-Let's do it. Excuse me.

110
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,202
I'll be sad.

111
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,326
That's just...

112
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,971
There, that's so you learn
not to take what's not yours.

113
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,167
Gosh, I beat you up.

114
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,209
I love these beatings.

115
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,204
- Cut.
-Marker.

116
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,601
- Fire extinguisher!
-Fire extinguisher.

117
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:46,006
This looks like a ghetto barbeque.
That's what I have to say.

118
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,206
Okay, it's time.

119
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,681
Okay, it looks great now. Come on.

120
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,484
Is this one loaded?

121
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,085
- Two and three.
-That's it.

122
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,601
Now let your hand slide,
open up your arms...

123
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,808
...and point it at the height
they tell you.

124
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,811
- Like this?
-Exactly.

125
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,247
You going to sit there
on top of other people's money?

126
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,006
If you don't come out
it'll be too bad for your widows.

127
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,083
- Okay?
-Perfect!

128
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,924
Doctor...

129
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:47,126
...do infants remember
everything we do?

130
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,091
No, not a thing.

131
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,009
Okay, put him down.

132
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,090
The doctor is almost like a priest.

133
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,605
DOCTOR
LUIZ CARLOS VASCONCELOS

134
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,330
They come to him for confession.

135
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,609
He tells them what they
want to hear during difficult times.

136
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,526
And with you now...

137
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,121
...our untamed diva of dance...

138
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,369
...the woman who lives
in all thieves' hearts...

139
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,683
...here at the detention centre...

140
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,128
Rita Cadillac!

141
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,843
I'm known as Carandiru's godmother...

142
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,286
RITA CADILLAC

143
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,081
...because it's the biggest prison
in Latin America...

144
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,651
...and so it became famous.

145
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,321
Even though the prisoners
are no longer here...

146
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,448
PRODUCTION DESIGNER
CLOVIS BUENO

147
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,810
...we're constantly seeing traces
of the way they lived here.

148
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,883
I've never worked like this before.

149
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,089
It's like shooting a Dracula movie
at Dracula's house...

150
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,408
...or a Snow White movie
at her castle.

151
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,284
You come out first.

152
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,442
Come and then let her out.

153
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,331
Come here, please.

154
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,002
You walk through here.

155
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,850
When the camera reaches you,
continue and you'll end up there.

156
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,963
The judge is here.
Everybody quiet, please.

157
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,010
“Take Too Bad as your husband?

158
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,886
I do.

159
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,042
I learned a lot and overcame
misconceptions.

160
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,201

00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,251
It was hard looking in the mirror
and trying to find Lady Di.

162
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,803
I couldn't just mimic a woman's
voice or hand movements.

163
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,405
It's far beyond the stereotype.

164
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,210
I lifted the veil...

165
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,091
Learning to understand,
accept and not judge...

166
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,046
...is the real challenge.

167
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,006
- Let's finish this, okay?
-Okay.

168
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,367
You are mezzo-soprano
or soprano?

169
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,370
-L'm bass, man.
-Our Maria Carlo.

170
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,490
I'm bass, man.

171
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,331
Okay, you're going to
sing a samba for us today.

172
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,846
No, no.
Let's do the "Ave Maria", slowly.

173
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,970
I compare the character with a flower
that grew in the asphalt.

174
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,406
LADY DI
RODRIGO SANTORO

175
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,006
The contrast makes
the character very rich.

176
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,970
This is very interesting
for the actor.

177
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,531
There are ghosts in here...

178
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,125
PRODUCTION DESIGNER
CLOVIS BUENO

179
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,449
...that whisper things in our ears.
And that works too.

180
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,211
Cut!

181
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,329
Sometimes we have to breathe.

182
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,965
DEUSDETE
CAIO BLAT

183
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,409
Hector comes and thinks
that we're all frightened, shaking.

184
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,326
Rehearsing the scenes.
He thinks it's all very theatrical.

185
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,562
Because we've been living
in this world...

186
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,324
...we need to remember that...

187
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,610
My character is going
to spend 28 years in here.

188
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:29,008
We have to get used to it.
This is everyday life for them.

189
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,766
So that facial expression
belongs to your character?

190
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,049
That's fine then. I thought you
were epileptic for a minute.

191
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,088
I'm being honest.

192
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,808
Is there a cure for guilt?

193
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,885
No two prisoners are alike.

194
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,405
EZEQUIEL
LAZARO RAMOS

195
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,801
You can talk about them as a group...

196
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,167
...but it's a very diverse
group of people.

197
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,728
Come to settle your debt?

198
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,527
Hey, man, right now Ezequiel's
in a tight spot.

199
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,923
So he thinks to himself,
"Zion's a reasonable guy.

200
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,004
He'll take the surfboard
as collateral for the debt."

201
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,447
Then Ezequiel can have another
little rock of crack, right, man?

202
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,483
Wrong.

203
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,686
Pay what you owe!

204
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,524
When you see a movie with inmates...

205
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,011
EZEQUIEL
LAZARO RAMOS

206
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,164
...you think, "Oh, no, jail, criminals."
But once you're in it...

207
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,004
...you realize they
are human beings.

208
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,289
They've committed crimes,
which is a very serious thing...

209
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,523
...but they have their own personality.

210
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,766
When I went to visit Zico, Deusdete
didn't let us do crack in there.

211
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,843
That's no reason to kill!

212
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,967
Before your line, pay attention
to what the others are saying.

213
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,921
You're thinking about what's going on.

214
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,890
I saw you doing this
and turning around.

215
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,162
You can't do that, okay?

216
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,288
Please. Let's go again.

217
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,805
Rolling!

218
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,161
Action!

219
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,606
I was scared shitless.

220
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,286
Went to bed and woke up burned.

221
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,410
How dare he kill without asking us.

222
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,365
How dare he kill without asking us.

223
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,410
Mind your own business.

224
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,006
We all...

225
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,802
This story is very serious. Please.

226
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,682
Lift your chin up.

227
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,889
Is he okay over there?
Let's shoot it again.

228
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,530
- Let's go.
-Let's roll.

229
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,364
Roll sound.

230
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,968
He was a childhood friend.

231
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,569
If you had a friend to advise you,
would you have done the same thing?

232
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,245
That's their problem.

233
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,364
You're wrong.

234
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,087
Now it's our problem.

235
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,606
He's a great character.

236
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,410
EBONY
IVAN DE ALMEIDA

237
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,121
With time, I've started going
to sleep with Ebony...

238
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,451
...waking up with him, talking to him.
He's always with me.

239
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,242
You hear the voice
and then you start walking...

240
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,050
Okay? I'm not as interested in
the entrance if it's a straight line.

241
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,690
One more time.

242
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,928
Do we have enough film?

243
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,651
You're changing the magazines?
Okay!

244
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,000
He enters and stops right here.

245
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,130
He stops for a moment
to make an entrance.

246
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,123
Enter, brother.

247
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,005
Come!

248
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,845
Come!

249
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,446
Did you know the Lord
has a plan for you?

250
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,731
Isn't that what it's like every day,
brother?

251
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,769
He needs to be in the shot.

252
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,369
Let's start from "kneel down."

253
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,689
So, brother, kneel down.

254
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,411
Will you accept Jesus?

255
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,807
Will you accept Jesus? Will you?

256
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,001
Which of you has accepted Jesus?

257
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,446
- I have!
-I have!

258
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,886
Hallelujah!

259
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,520
Hallelujah!

260
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,971
- Cut!
-That's a cut!

261
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,841
I was joking around saying:

262
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,411
CHICO
MILTON GONQALVES

263
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,967
"This is Babenco being a square."

264
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,084
I mean, in this movie,
he believes that after everything...

265
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,483
...things will turn out okay.
There is still hope.

266
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:01,368
After everything, if you can keep
some sort of coherence...

267
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,961
...then dreams will come true.

268
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,929
Chico, how come you're in here?

269
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,805
Oh, doctor, you want to hear
yet another lie?

270
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,009
No one in here is really guilty,
haven't you noticed?

271
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,844
Let's start from here.

272
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,888
We need the players list.

273
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,166
Action!

274
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,450
Criminals of Brazil,
the big day is here:

275
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,924
The Pavilion 9 finals!

276
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,442
Some say it started because of a debt
for five packs of cigarettes.

277
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,888
Others say that it was a fight
over the soccer game.

278
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,683
One or two say it was about
a pair of underpants.

279
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,641
Like they say:
"Jail's no home for the truth."

280
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,845
Watch out.

281
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,969
You walk over here.
Look where I am.

282
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,442
- Is this right, Walter?
-You move a little to the left.

283
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,809
So you have to be here,
but not with your back turned.

284
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,081
The guys are coming.
There's a conflict building up.

285
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,564
This discussion will take place
between the two gangs.

286
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,087
It's like West Side Story.
One gang on each side.

287
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,448
Then we move inside that nucleus.

288
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,604
-It's a classic.
-Classic! There is no--

289
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,450
Let's start on that side.

290
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,807
It's almost dull.
It's been done too many times.

291
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,566
It's practically just
manual labour now.

292
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,764
Manual labour, it's part of our job.
Exactly.

293
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,288
We'll start from here.

294
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,611
- Let's shoot in order or we'll get lost.
-Let's do it.

295
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,922
Come have a look from here.

296
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,162
- You better behave yourself.
-Wait!

297
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,930
Go fuck yourself, damn it!

298
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,489
- That was great.
-Excellent. Now, enter with the rag.

299
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,002
Just look what you did to him.

300
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,731
- Greedy bastard!
-You could have used your hand, man!

301
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,326
- Just over a pair of underpants!
-Calm down.

302
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,211
Why couldn't you have waited?

303
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,006
Now you speak.

304
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,881
- Greedy bastard!
-You could have used your hand, man!

305
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,691
Just over a pair of underpants!
I'm gonna beat your face up.

306
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,126
You're mixing up the lines.

307
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,566
Okay, speak.

308
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,961
Do you think you're growing up,
is that it?

309
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,242
Growing up? That's not in the script.

310
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,686
No, it's not.

311
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,684
There's not really a script anymore.

312
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,043
We're improvising to pick up the pace.
The lines are short.

313
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,650
The speech leads us
straight into the fight scene.

314
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:46,364
Let's stick to the script for now.
Again, please.

315
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,766
- Greedy bastard!
-Look at my hand and imagine it's him.

316
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,445
Greedy bastard!

317
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,605
- You could have used your hand, man!
-Just over a pair of underpants!

318
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,365
Come forward.
Do that thing with your hands.

319
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,125
Just over a pair of underpants!

320
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,521
Come, hit me in the face now.
You son of a bitch.

321
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,730
- Why couldn't you have waited?
-What's it got to do with you?

322
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,567
The problem is the touching.
If you use your hands...

323
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,882
The minute you touch him,
the fight starts.

324
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,042
"Don't touch me."
Then the fight starts.

325
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,283
- What's it got to do with you?
-Wait.

326
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,044
Go fuck yourself, damn it!

327
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,006
"Calm down." You're saying,
"Calm down," remember?

328
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,811
- Then he pushes you.
-Wait!

329
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,721
Right, now you grab him,
lift him and walk out.

330
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,528
Everybody pay attention.

331
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,121
<i>"Which is the biggest
in Latin America...</i>

332
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,726
<i>...with a total capacity
of 4000 inmates.</i>

333
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,487
<i>Only, nowadays it's more crowded
than ever...</i>

334
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,642
<i>...with 7500 prisoners!</i>

335
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,571
They are throwing water on us.

336
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,047
Don't throw it down.
Don't throw it down.

337
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,166
Now, go. Go, g0, g0-

338
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,286
It's nearly ready.
Light the fire. Light the fire.

339
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,011
Fire!

340
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,891
Run. Hurry up. Go, go, go.

341
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,081
When the flames get high around us...

342
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,687
...here is the hottest spot,
because it's the centre of the circle.

343
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,127
We're going to invade it.
Say it like you mean it.

344
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,843
You have to close down
a jail like this...

345
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,047
DRAUZIO VARELLA

346
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,806
...and get smaller jails
with 500 or 600 inmates...

347
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,691
...that you can manage properly...

348
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,481
...and where you can apply the law
accurately and have some justice...

349
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:08,363
...and try to organize a system to help
them to get jobs when they come out.

350
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:12,491
If they have jobs, there's a chance
they won't go back to crime.

351
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,962
I'm not saying they won't.
lam not naive.

352
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,161
Everybody stay back,
otherwise you're gonna die.

353
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,726
- Do you take it off?
-Yes.

354
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,769
Let's go, let's go.

355
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,400
What's the problem with beginning
in the back?

356
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,648
You'll have more time.

357
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,366
- Good.
-lt's good from there.

358
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,491
Scene 157-8, take two.

359
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,087
-8-A, second.
-Camera.

360
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,766
Action!

361
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,968
- Oh, no!
-Go, go, go.

362
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,726
He's gonna shoot!

363
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,403
Ezequiel looked at him,
Silvio hit the door...

364
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,489
...took Ezequiel's
place and got shot.

365
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,971
This is where I fell.

366
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,403
- Now, why did he do that?
-Keep your upper body erect.

367
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,608
- Try to fall on both your knees.
-I got it.

368
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,570
This is what you're doing,
this one first, then the other.

369
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,883
I'm here, and I get shot.
Then I go:

370
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,849
Damn! Why did he do that
with his head?

371
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,970
Cut it there, before he
moves his head again.

372
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,842
It's a pity,
it could go on a bit longer.

373
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,286
I got nervous...

374
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,441
DAGGER
MILHEM CORTAZ

375
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,365
...with all that shooting around,
coming against me...

376
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,011
...and I was a little afraid
that the fake bullets would hurt.

377
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:53,963
I felt so... I was planning
to do the death scene smiling...

378
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,962
...but I couldn't bring myself
to smile.

379
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,567
Slowly start going down.

380
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,808
There. There. There.

381
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,486
Now, go all the way down.

382
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,886
Put your hands on the wall!

383
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,243
Unless... Let me see you
with your arms out.

384
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,641
If his hand is not touching the wall,
it's more complicated.

385
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:29,530
Sure. With coordination
it can be done.

386
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,731
Shoot.

387
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,646
There was the effect we wanted.

388
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,247
The endless gratitude...

389
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,564
...to the divine providence, to life,
to the destiny, for having saved you.

390
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:52,045
Try to use a more colloquial tone
when you speak into the camera.

391
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,405
It's like a make-believe trial...

392
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:01,168
...where people have to say what they
remember about that day.

393
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:05,484
It's a mix of statement and reflection.
That's why it's weird.

394
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:10,089
Please, I am asking you...

395
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,005
...if you want to talk,
do it somewhere else.

396
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,484
It's impossible.

397
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,531
It's a delicate scene.
Everybody needs to concentrate...

398
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,205
...on what has to be done.

399
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,206
You are in the back.

400
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,887
You see the person walking in
with the light behind him.

401
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,566
He comes in, sits down...

402
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:40,242
...and then we cut to this other plan,
in another proportion.

403
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,811
We don't want a jump.

404
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,167
As for me, we could have
revealed that there.

405
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,606
I have a suggestion.

406
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,651
This is not something I will discuss.

407
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,326
I spent three years writing this script.

408
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,960
He is sitting down on his bed
reading the Bible.

409
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,004
Look at the perspective we have
when he comes in. That's it.

410
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,571
It's unnoticeable.

411
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:04,569
When the audience becomes
involved with the reading...

412
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,370
...they should see him getting
smaller and smaller.

413
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,965
What beautiful words.

414
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,850
"A thousand may fall
at your right hand...

415
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,361
...but no evil will come near you...

416
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,642
...no scourge come near your tent."

417
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,922
Anyone alive,
undress and come out naked!

418
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,926
Anyone alive, undress...

419
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:24,405
No one had ever thought of that
before the early '90s.

420
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:28,406
Experiments that have been done
with monkeys, gorillas, chimps...

421
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,326
...and all those animals
very similar to humans...

422
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:38,886
...show that if you lock
several individuals or families...

423
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,202
...of these species
in a confined space...

424
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,843
...if you double the amount
of creatures in that same area...

425
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,606
...violence levels
decrease dramatically.

426
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:53,402
It's as if the animals
recognize the danger...

427
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:57,485
...of the situation
and subconsciously...

428
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:03,767
...their instinct for survival compels
them to act more harmoniously...

429
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:07,049
...in order to survive.
Then we have Drauzio's question:

430
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,931
What would you do if you
were stuck in a community...

431
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,969
...with so many dangerous people?

432
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:16,808
I would try to be of substantial use
to the survival of the group...

433
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,247
...to guarantee my own existence.

434
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,323
We got the shot!
We got the shot!
