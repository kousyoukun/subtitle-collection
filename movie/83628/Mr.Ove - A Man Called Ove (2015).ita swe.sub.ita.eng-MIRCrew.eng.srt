1
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,580
No, no, no.
This line starts behind me.

2
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:58,060
- That will be 50 kronor.
- No. It will be 35 kronor.

3
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:02,020
This is only valid if you buy two bouquets.

4
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,752
Sweetie, I only need one bouquet.

5
00:01:06,252 --> 00:01:09,058
Half of 70 is still only 35.

6
00:01:09,558 --> 00:01:13,935
One bouquet costs 50 kronor.
Two bouquets together cost 70 kronor.

7
00:01:14,435 --> 00:01:15,608
That doesn't make any sense.

8
00:01:16,108 --> 00:01:21,923
It's pure madness. I'm reporting this
to the Consumer Ombudsman.

9
00:01:22,169 --> 00:01:25,592
- Is there a manager here?
- No, she's at lunch.

10
00:01:26,223 --> 00:01:30,916
Lunch? Learning to count would
be a better pursuit.

11
00:01:40,196 --> 00:01:44,916
Two prices for the same thing?
That's pure madness.

12
00:01:50,676 --> 00:01:52,756
But just so you know...

13
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:56,276
Two bouquets won't be a habit.

14
00:02:01,773 --> 00:02:03,203
I miss you.

15
00:02:04,732 --> 00:02:12,677
A MAN CALLED OVE

16
00:03:24,985 --> 00:03:26,659
Good-for-nothings.

17
00:04:10,212 --> 00:04:13,732
- The dog should stop peeing at our place.
- Don't listen to the mean old man.

18
00:04:15,092 --> 00:04:18,618
Anders! Did you see what the old man did?
He tried to kill Prince.

19
00:04:18,672 --> 00:04:20,412
- What did you do to the dog?
- That's no dog.

20
00:04:20,512 --> 00:04:23,032
It looks like a pair of
winter boots with eyes.

21
00:04:23,092 --> 00:04:25,852
- Walking dogs here isn't allowed.
- Don't involve the police.

22
00:04:26,012 --> 00:04:29,497
Can't you say something to him, Anders?
You're Chairman of the Board.

23
00:04:29,997 --> 00:04:33,026
- I just did exactly that.
- No, I mean properly.

24
00:04:49,435 --> 00:04:50,968
Good morning.

25
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:58,712
- Everything okay?
- Aren't you chatty?

26
00:05:00,932 --> 00:05:06,203
- Ove! Can we have a moment with you?
- In the office.

27
00:05:08,815 --> 00:05:11,535
Now you'll be fucking promoted, eh?

28
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:16,775
- Is everything well?
- Yes.

29
00:05:17,975 --> 00:05:21,575
- How long have you worked here, Ove?
- 43 years.

30
00:05:21,735 --> 00:05:24,334
- Shit.
- Shit.

31
00:05:25,535 --> 00:05:29,858
- You took over your father's job?
- Yes.

32
00:05:30,615 --> 00:05:35,278
We have an opportunity for you.

33
00:05:35,778 --> 00:05:40,366
You're only 59. You might want to
do something else with your life.

34
00:05:44,996 --> 00:05:47,886
Does 43 years at the same place suggest that?

35
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,722
It...

36
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:57,647
- You want to fire me.
- That isn't exactly how I'd express it.

37
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:58,612
But it's close.

38
00:05:58,755 --> 00:06:02,749
- We want to offer you a program.
- A kind of government-run training course.

39
00:06:02,975 --> 00:06:09,006
- A further step.
- The digital is taking over more and more.

40
00:06:09,444 --> 00:06:12,164
Yeah, then I have a proposal.

41
00:06:12,324 --> 00:06:16,984
Isn't it easier if I just get up and leave?

42
00:06:19,164 --> 00:06:22,164
Good. Then that's what we'll do.

43
00:06:22,324 --> 00:06:27,758
Wait, Ove. We have a farewell present.

44
00:06:28,564 --> 00:06:31,534
A garden spade.

45
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:20,697
You need to forward your phone service
there if you're going to travel.

46
00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:23,719
- There aren't any phones there.
- You're joking?

47
00:08:50,468 --> 00:08:52,988
Take it easy. Come on.

48
00:08:53,148 --> 00:08:55,508
Careful. Hello, hello!

49
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,280
[speaking Persian]

50
00:09:00,148 --> 00:09:03,028
Stop. Stop! Stop!

51
00:09:03,908 --> 00:09:06,708
- Oh dear.
- What the fuck?

52
00:09:07,868 --> 00:09:12,548
- Drive forward a little. Patrick!
- What are you doing?

53
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:16,308
- He's not very smart.
- Driving here isn't permitted.

54
00:09:16,468 --> 00:09:21,347
- Can't you read Swedish signs?
- Are you blind? Am I the one driving?

55
00:09:21,847 --> 00:09:23,791
Nice to meet you. Patrick.

56
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:28,067
You should be called Mickey Mouse,
but if you're backing up -

57
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:31,651
- turn the opposite direction and
look in the rear-view mirror.

58
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,879
- What's she saying?
- No idea. It's Persian.

59
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:39,279
Isn't it beautiful?

60
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:43,439
No... no, hello!

61
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:46,119
- No, no!
- Did I hit something?

62
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:50,239
Out, now! Stand someplace
where you aren't in the way.

63
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:55,959
- Remember...
- Thanks. I can drive a car.

64
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:06,957
- What is that, now?
- The backup camera.

65
00:10:07,457 --> 00:10:08,792
Camera? What fucking cam...

66
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:11,438
- Hi.
- Hey, you.

67
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,297
Mom!

68
00:10:22,377 --> 00:10:27,097
Backup cameras? You shouldn't
even have a cassette tape.

69
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:03,692
- Petter!
- Idiots.

70
00:11:03,852 --> 00:11:06,212
Fuck, I can't find my jacket.

71
00:11:06,372 --> 00:11:09,932
- Petter! Petter!
- Yeah.

72
00:11:11,012 --> 00:11:15,252
- Come here! Petter!
- What do you want?

73
00:11:26,225 --> 00:11:27,908
PARKING ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN!

74
00:11:38,042 --> 00:11:39,501
Scram!

75
00:12:16,463 --> 00:12:19,343
You took my bike.
Can I get it back?

76
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:23,743
- Wasn't it a woman's bike?
- It's my girlfriend's.

77
00:12:23,903 --> 00:12:26,863
- And where does she live?
- 142 over there.

78
00:12:27,023 --> 00:12:29,983
With the communists who
introduced waste sorting?

79
00:12:30,143 --> 00:12:33,863
- Then she can get it herself.
- Whatever.

80
00:12:34,023 --> 00:12:36,943
- Should I let him take my bike?
- He's weird.

81
00:12:43,257 --> 00:12:46,009
Hey, Ove. Everything okay?

82
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:51,129
Why does everyone ask if it's okay?
Why wouldn't it be okay?

83
00:12:51,289 --> 00:12:56,169
You're not working. It's the middle
of the day and you've never been sick.

84
00:12:56,329 --> 00:12:59,969
Do you want something?
Or do you like talking your life away?

85
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:03,329
Do you want come get some lunch?

86
00:13:03,489 --> 00:13:05,169
Idiots!

87
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:13,809
Bloody maniacs!
Driving here is not permitted!

88
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:21,347
- Did you say something, or?
- Yeah, driving here is forbidden.

89
00:13:21,847 --> 00:13:26,487
- Oh yeah? Well, I have permission.
- The hell you do.

90
00:13:26,647 --> 00:13:29,887
- Goodbye. - Drive!
- Get away from here!

91
00:13:43,487 --> 00:13:45,327
Is something wrong?

92
00:13:45,487 --> 00:13:48,836
If you have visitors, there's guest parking.

93
00:13:50,436 --> 00:13:52,996
That's what we decided.

94
00:13:53,156 --> 00:13:56,996
They were from the municipality.
They were bringing Rune home.

95
00:13:59,716 --> 00:14:03,516
We've been getting so cold inside.
Can you take a look?

96
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,236
No. Put on another blanket.

97
00:14:13,356 --> 00:14:17,076
Sorry I didn't come yesterday
like I was supposed to.

98
00:14:17,236 --> 00:14:22,829
I just couldn't.
It's been a real circus at home.

99
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:26,733
New neighbors moved in across the way.

100
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:31,918
You'd be shocked how people are these
days. No one can do anything anymore.

101
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:35,050
They can't back up with a trailer,
or change a tire.

102
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:39,770
When you ask them the simplest thing
in the world, they're eating lunch.

103
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:46,573
Think about it. Soon we'll have a country
where everyone is busy eating lunch.

104
00:14:48,048 --> 00:14:51,267
You're lucky you don't
have to be a part of it.

105
00:14:52,995 --> 00:14:57,635
A white car showed up in the area.
Complete maniacs.

106
00:15:01,515 --> 00:15:04,595
There's no order when you aren't home.

107
00:15:12,035 --> 00:15:17,166
If I hurry now, maybe we can even
see each other today.

108
00:15:22,712 --> 00:15:25,226
I miss you.

109
00:16:16,825 --> 00:16:19,625
What the fuck now.

110
00:16:29,305 --> 00:16:32,145
Yeah? What's the matter?

111
00:16:32,305 --> 00:16:35,465
- We have rice and chicken.
- Are you selling rice?

112
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:38,765
It's just a little food
to thank you for your help.

113
00:16:39,025 --> 00:16:44,414
Persian food with saffron. Damn good.
Parvaneh is insanely good at cooking -

114
00:16:44,705 --> 00:16:47,025
- and I am insanely good at...

115
00:16:50,404 --> 00:16:55,124
The trailer is gone. I saw the note.
Totally right, it was our fault.

116
00:16:56,164 --> 00:16:59,084
- We thought you might be little hungry.
- No, I'm not hungry.

117
00:16:59,244 --> 00:17:02,564
- Then we'll throw it out.
- No, nothing is thrown out here.

118
00:17:02,724 --> 00:17:07,084
- We thought we heard you have a ladder.
- Of course I have a ladder.

119
00:17:07,244 --> 00:17:11,044
Everyone should have a ladder here.
It's in the bylaws, in fact.

120
00:17:11,204 --> 00:17:13,604
If you are familiar with them.

121
00:17:15,404 --> 00:17:21,112
Then maybe could we... borrow it?

122
00:17:23,492 --> 00:17:26,608
It feels safe with a
guy who's always home.

123
00:17:26,777 --> 00:17:29,697
Here are the supports.

124
00:17:29,857 --> 00:17:32,137
And the instruction manual.

125
00:17:32,297 --> 00:17:34,657
So... Fuck!

126
00:17:34,817 --> 00:17:38,497
- Do you have an 'insect' key?
- Hex key.

127
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:40,737
No, 'insect' key.

128
00:17:40,897 --> 00:17:45,465
What does it have to do with insects?
Six sides - hex key.

129
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:47,800
Google it.

130
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:55,843
Ove? Can you look at the heating now?

131
00:17:55,958 --> 00:18:00,198
- If I ask nicely?
- Try to bleed the radiator.

132
00:18:00,358 --> 00:18:03,478
- Could that be it?
- Hi. I'm Parvaneh.

133
00:18:03,638 --> 00:18:07,358
- This is my husband Patrick.
- Always nice to meet new neighbors.

134
00:18:07,518 --> 00:18:13,028
God, how nice it is here.
It's paradise for the kids.

135
00:18:13,238 --> 00:18:16,943
Goddammit. Does no one have a job anymore?

136
00:18:17,078 --> 00:18:21,891
- Aren't you going to 'lift' her radiator?
- Bleed.

137
00:18:22,318 --> 00:18:26,840
One doesn't lift radiators.
One bleeds them.

138
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:32,127
Maybe Rune should have asked me
about the heating before the coup d'état.

139
00:18:32,287 --> 00:18:35,687
- Please, Ove, it wasn't a coup d'état.
- A coup was what it was!

140
00:18:35,847 --> 00:18:38,607
- Do you want the supports, or what?
- Yeah, yeah.

141
00:18:41,647 --> 00:18:45,967
Ove was Chairman of the Board, then
everyone voted for my husband Rune.

142
00:18:46,127 --> 00:18:48,847
Parvaneh! Check it out.
They're damn nice...

143
00:18:49,007 --> 00:18:51,287
Don't take them. They were for Sonja.

144
00:18:51,447 --> 00:18:55,887
- The thing is that she was in...
- Now shut your mouth! Quiet!

145
00:18:56,047 --> 00:18:59,767
Now that's enough!
Get out of here, everybody! Go home!

146
00:19:00,727 --> 00:19:02,367
Get out of here!

147
00:19:10,564 --> 00:19:12,604
Paradise, huh?

148
00:19:56,303 --> 00:19:57,903
Ove?

149
00:20:01,503 --> 00:20:07,277
Ove? Can you come look at something?

150
00:20:07,503 --> 00:20:09,743
Yeah. Should I come there?

151
00:20:16,889 --> 00:20:18,712
Ove?

152
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:24,353
- How nice the bookshelf is.
- Yeah.

153
00:20:24,513 --> 00:20:27,113
How many books do you have?

154
00:20:27,273 --> 00:20:32,173
It's these here and the box in the kitchen,
and then the ones in the storeroom.

155
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,580
I'll build another.

156
00:20:59,193 --> 00:21:02,913
They say the brain works faster as it dies.

157
00:21:03,073 --> 00:21:07,793
As if the impressions of the outside world
become slow-motion.

158
00:21:07,953 --> 00:21:12,793
I had time to think about a good deal.
Mostly about the radiator, actually.

159
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:24,100
And about Mom.
She died early.

160
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,260
Dad wasn't one of those people
who showed sadness.

161
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,020
- Thanks for coming.
- I didn't, either.

162
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,220
It is what it is.

163
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,180
One thing is for sure.

164
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:51,076
Whatever we do in this life,
we will not live past it.

165
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:53,290
Come on, Ove, we're going home.

166
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:01,130
Dad didn't say much.
He mostly cared about the house.

167
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:03,130
And cars.

168
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:07,512
Clearly they didn't say much either.

169
00:22:08,271 --> 00:22:10,840
Cars can give you freedom.

170
00:22:11,492 --> 00:22:16,492
But if you act like an asshole with them,
they'll take it from you right away.

171
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:19,532
But that night, he talked.

172
00:22:19,692 --> 00:22:24,892
Ove? I want you to know how
everything is connected.

173
00:22:28,052 --> 00:22:30,012
- Uh. In a Saab 92.
- Yeah.

174
00:22:30,972 --> 00:22:35,599
- And what do the spark plugs do?
- They make the car go.

175
00:22:36,332 --> 00:22:38,092
Exactly.

176
00:22:47,204 --> 00:22:51,324
This, Ove... This is the life!

177
00:22:52,964 --> 00:22:56,684
They're never going to make
a better car than Saab.

178
00:23:08,244 --> 00:23:11,684
But for the most part, he said nothing at all.

179
00:23:19,503 --> 00:23:22,743
After school, I went to Dad's job.

180
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:25,143
- Hey, Dad!
- Hey, Ove!

181
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:27,823
He said it was safest.

182
00:23:27,983 --> 00:23:29,743
Get off the track, Ove!

183
00:23:29,903 --> 00:23:33,503
- Get off the track, Ove!
- What are you saying?

184
00:23:34,263 --> 00:23:35,863
Behind you!

185
00:23:43,268 --> 00:23:46,908
It was probably the first time in my life
that my father hugged me.

186
00:23:47,068 --> 00:23:51,548
I don't know why, but for some
strange reason I thought of Mom.

187
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:53,788
You have to be more careful.

188
00:23:53,948 --> 00:23:56,508
He probably did, too.

189
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:04,708
Then I got the opportunity.

190
00:24:09,468 --> 00:24:14,148
There. Ove, it's okay now.
Now let Dad go.

191
00:24:19,343 --> 00:24:24,183
Everyone said that he was too nice.
How can one be too nice?

192
00:24:48,036 --> 00:24:52,076
I got to know my father's fine colleagues.

193
00:24:53,556 --> 00:24:56,396
- Tom was one of them.
- Give it back.

194
00:24:56,556 --> 00:25:00,772
- No. I found it.
- You're going to get such a beating...

195
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,300
Sometimes one doesn't know if what
one is doing is the right thing.

196
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:08,300
- It's just a feeling one gets.
- You fucking little brat.

197
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:14,008
Sometimes feelings can be associated
in a strange way with direct pain.

198
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:21,820
We find what we keep.
That's how it's always been. Always.

199
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,940
Ove?

200
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:29,100
Do whatever you want with the purse.
It was you who found it.

201
00:25:32,909 --> 00:25:36,149
- I found it on the train.
- Thank you so much.

202
00:25:39,629 --> 00:25:45,432
- Why didn't you tell on Tom?
- We don't talk about what others do.

203
00:25:45,469 --> 00:25:48,709
- I thought about keeping the purse.
- Yeah, I know.

204
00:25:48,869 --> 00:25:51,869
But in the end you gave it back.

205
00:25:52,029 --> 00:25:55,087
Honesty is the best thing, Ove.

206
00:25:55,309 --> 00:26:02,157
But sometimes honesty needs a little help.

207
00:26:07,396 --> 00:26:10,836
- Do you understand?
- Yeah, very well. I understand.

208
00:26:16,076 --> 00:26:21,107
Come on, let's go home.
Hop on.

209
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:26,654
Finally the day came when
I got to know real freedom.

210
00:26:32,214 --> 00:26:35,800
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, Ove.

211
00:26:37,214 --> 00:26:43,736
- How did it go?
- Yeah, you... see for yourself.

212
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:02,719
It was damn good. Did you see?

213
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:13,359
Guys?

214
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:18,159
Have you seen Ove's marks?
He's going to be our next foreman!

215
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:36,239
What? Fives and fours.
Fantastic.

216
00:27:43,311 --> 00:27:47,522
Call the foreman!
Call the foreman, for fuck's sake!

217
00:27:51,704 --> 00:27:53,944
Dad!

218
00:28:07,224 --> 00:28:09,104
What the hell?

219
00:28:10,424 --> 00:28:13,384
What's this fucking garbage you're selling?

220
00:28:13,544 --> 00:28:17,390
Universal rope, you said.
"Holds everything".

221
00:28:20,047 --> 00:28:22,847
What did you use it for?

222
00:28:23,007 --> 00:28:24,647
Ugh!

223
00:28:26,047 --> 00:28:27,807
Idiot.

224
00:28:29,687 --> 00:28:33,727
It's impossible to get a
proper rope anymore.

225
00:28:50,575 --> 00:28:56,195
The new neighbors keep making a mess.
Eating rice with saffron.

226
00:28:56,655 --> 00:28:59,495
What's wrong with meat and potatoes?

227
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:03,575
One doesn't need to pour
fancy things in the food!

228
00:29:11,247 --> 00:29:15,087
This must be the first time
you've had to wait for me.

229
00:29:28,847 --> 00:29:32,803
- Hey! What are you doing?
- It scratched Prince.

230
00:29:34,127 --> 00:29:38,946
Throw another stone and I'll
sew a doormat with your mop!

231
00:29:39,446 --> 00:29:43,566
It's a chihuahua. And the cat
surely has both rabies and the plague.

232
00:29:43,726 --> 00:29:47,566
Clearly you do, too.
But we don't throw stones at you.

233
00:29:48,966 --> 00:29:52,526
You still think that you can do
what you want? Slimy fucking old man.

234
00:29:52,686 --> 00:29:55,166
- I'm going to tell Anders.
- Well, go ahead.

235
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:58,926
If you can make someone who
drives an Audi understand.

236
00:29:59,086 --> 00:30:02,326
Four zeros on the grill and
a fifth at the wheel.

237
00:30:05,686 --> 00:30:11,715
If it pisses on our fences again,
I'll electrify them!

238
00:30:12,766 --> 00:30:16,782
Idiot. Yeah, that applies to you, too.

239
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:21,659
Scram! This is private property.

240
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:52,300
August 27th, you borrowed my hose.
I need it now.

241
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:58,740
- Are you going to water in March?
- You watered, now I'm watering.

242
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:02,460
Can't you look at the radiator
now that you're here?

243
00:31:04,505 --> 00:31:08,745
Thanks. That was really nice.
I have food on the stove. Want some?

244
00:31:08,905 --> 00:31:14,736
- Thanks, I've eaten.
- I see. I'll just get the hose.

245
00:31:20,905 --> 00:31:25,293
Rune? Rune?

246
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:40,471
Just so you know, people do whatever
the fuck they want in the association.

247
00:31:41,951 --> 00:31:45,831
Everything you and I built is going to ruin.

248
00:31:45,991 --> 00:31:52,110
To hell with it. I don't care.

249
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:58,180
In fact, I'm thinking of
leaving here. For good.

250
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:06,799
I'm going to Sonja.
I thought you'd be glad to know.

251
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:12,340
You can't do anything about it.
Just sit and watch as everything...

252
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,540
The food is almost ready.

253
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:20,120
Thanks for loaning it.
It was really nice of you.

254
00:32:20,282 --> 00:32:22,762
- You don't want a little food?
- No.

255
00:32:22,922 --> 00:32:26,362
- Jimmy's eating, too.
- Stuffed cabbage, Ove. Damn good.

256
00:32:26,522 --> 00:32:31,162
- Rune would certainly appreciate it.
- He neither hears nor understands a thing.

257
00:32:31,322 --> 00:32:34,642
Rune understands a lot more than people think.

258
00:32:34,802 --> 00:32:39,402
It's as if he knows exactly
what's going on in our heads.

259
00:32:43,442 --> 00:32:45,562
Yeah, I have to go now.

260
00:32:47,522 --> 00:32:49,802
Let go of the hose.

261
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,882
Let go of the hose!

262
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:07,230
Hey, Ove!
We're trying to put up a window.

263
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:12,131
- From outside? Good luck!
- You're holding the ladder, right?

264
00:33:20,121 --> 00:33:24,241
You should be holding the ladder.
Where are you going now?

265
00:33:28,374 --> 00:33:30,800
THANKS, IT WAS GOOD
OVE

266
00:33:33,626 --> 00:33:36,878
One can count on a Saab, at least.

267
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:09,010
The Director will see you now.

268
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:14,490
What a pity this was.

269
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:20,920
If we can help you with
anything, just say so.

270
00:35:20,996 --> 00:35:24,356
They were fine grades.

271
00:35:24,516 --> 00:35:28,356
It's yours. That's half of Dad's salary
up to the end of the month.

272
00:35:28,516 --> 00:35:32,568
He always paid in advance.

273
00:35:32,836 --> 00:35:36,676
- We can't take the money back.
- What's right is right.

274
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:40,636
Maybe we can find another solution.

275
00:35:43,972 --> 00:35:50,132
I knew how it was done, and
I knew all of Dad's colleagues.

276
00:35:50,292 --> 00:35:53,816
What are you going to do now
that Dad is in heaven?

277
00:35:59,452 --> 00:36:01,692
No, not that. Not that.

278
00:36:01,852 --> 00:36:03,412
Not that.

279
00:36:04,985 --> 00:36:08,425
There comes a time when one must decide -

280
00:36:08,585 --> 00:36:10,425
- who one wants to be.

281
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:13,785
Now we're even for the purse,
you little shit.

282
00:36:13,945 --> 00:36:16,105
For me, it was exactly then.

283
00:36:18,785 --> 00:36:20,545
The watch is mine!

284
00:36:40,122 --> 00:36:44,142
- Are you Ove Lindahl?
- Yes.

285
00:36:44,322 --> 00:36:46,962
- We've been looking for you.
- Oh yeah?

286
00:36:48,868 --> 00:36:51,668
We're going to take a look at your house.

287
00:36:51,828 --> 00:36:54,788
There's a new zoning plan for the area.

288
00:36:54,948 --> 00:36:59,188
The house isn't appropriate for
future building plans.

289
00:36:59,348 --> 00:37:02,702
No, Stig, we'll clear everything.

290
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:06,228
You see yourself.
It's a tear-down.

291
00:37:06,681 --> 00:37:10,481
It was the first time I met them,
but not the last.

292
00:37:10,641 --> 00:37:14,041
They never told me their names,
just where they were from.

293
00:37:14,201 --> 00:37:17,656
The men in the white shirts.

294
00:37:20,378 --> 00:37:23,018
And they always got what they wanted.

295
00:37:24,698 --> 00:37:28,138
- Ove? Fika break.
- Finally, it was finished.

296
00:37:28,298 --> 00:37:31,418
And it wasn't so bad if I say so myself.

297
00:37:31,578 --> 00:37:35,778
But the men in the
white shirts didn't like it.

298
00:37:37,658 --> 00:37:39,298
Hi.

299
00:37:41,135 --> 00:37:45,855
Some people say that fate is
the result of our own stupidity -

300
00:37:46,015 --> 00:37:49,375
- so one can probably say that
what changed my fate -

301
00:37:49,535 --> 00:37:53,135
- was the result of my neighbors' stupidity.

302
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:07,320
Is anyone in the house?
Is anyone in the house?

303
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,420
Help!

304
00:38:09,764 --> 00:38:12,084
Hello? Hello?!

305
00:38:12,244 --> 00:38:13,964
Help!

306
00:38:57,167 --> 00:38:59,367
- Disconnect the fire hose!
- I'm going in!

307
00:38:59,527 --> 00:39:02,647
I tried to reason with the firemen.

308
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:04,687
But then he showed up again.

309
00:39:04,847 --> 00:39:08,567
Turn off the water. Turn off the water!
It's going to be demolished anyway.

310
00:39:08,727 --> 00:39:11,747
Stop extinguishing!

311
00:39:12,247 --> 00:39:13,407
The white shirt.

312
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,519
How long have we been going?

313
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:39,679
- About an hour.
- Damn!

314
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:43,119
I could have woken you if
I knew you were getting off.

315
00:40:43,279 --> 00:40:47,439
You were so cute when you slept.
Did you oversleep?

316
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,479
No. It's no problem.

317
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,599
Tickets.

318
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:04,173
- Thank you.
- I don't have a ticket.

319
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:06,310
Then you have to buy a ticket.

320
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:12,152
- I'm sorry, I have no money, either.
- I've got it.

321
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:14,630
There.

322
00:41:19,417 --> 00:41:23,577
- I'll pay you back, of course.
- That's alright.

323
00:41:27,337 --> 00:41:30,097
I'm reading The Master and Margarita.

324
00:41:30,257 --> 00:41:32,217
- Do you know it?
- No.

325
00:41:32,377 --> 00:41:36,686
There's a cat in the book
who also doesn't pay his fare.

326
00:41:37,577 --> 00:41:41,166
Have you read any Mikhail Bulgakov?

327
00:41:41,561 --> 00:41:45,441
- No, I haven't read any of he.
- Of him.

328
00:41:47,921 --> 00:41:52,067
- Mmhmm.
- I'm studying to be a teacher.

329
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,060
I'm getting off here.

330
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:01,966
Wait! You forgot this.

331
00:42:35,962 --> 00:42:40,242
After that day, I got up every morning
and took the 7:30 train.

332
00:42:43,002 --> 00:42:45,642
But she'd completely disappeared.

333
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:53,190
After three weeks, I was about to give up.

334
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:08,310
- Hey.
- Hey.

335
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:19,128
- Do you usually take this train?
- Yeah.

336
00:43:20,408 --> 00:43:23,459
I'm in the army.

337
00:43:23,959 --> 00:43:27,079
In... the regiment.

338
00:43:27,999 --> 00:43:29,599
Mmhmm.

339
00:43:29,759 --> 00:43:36,536
Oh! I thought you should
get your money back.

340
00:43:39,321 --> 00:43:43,041
Wouldn't it be nicer to ask me to dinner?

341
00:43:44,561 --> 00:43:46,721
Dinner? Sure.

342
00:43:51,241 --> 00:43:54,881
I don't really have anywhere to cook dinner.

343
00:43:55,801 --> 00:43:58,201
I meant at a restaurant.

344
00:44:00,681 --> 00:44:03,201
Oh. Okay. Mmhmm.

345
00:44:05,967 --> 00:44:09,647
- If you usually go to restaurants.
- Yeah.

346
00:44:10,807 --> 00:44:13,647
- Then that's that.
- Absolutely.

347
00:44:46,458 --> 00:44:49,138
Hey! Hello.

348
00:44:49,298 --> 00:44:53,550
- You're fifteen minutes late.
- Oh yeah? Am I?

349
00:45:28,825 --> 00:45:30,385
So...

350
00:45:35,225 --> 00:45:38,985
- Do you know anything about cars?
- About cars?

351
00:45:39,145 --> 00:45:45,496
It's maybe a bit interesting to know
how they run.

352
00:45:46,638 --> 00:45:50,318
- It's not as simple as one thinks.
- Uhhuh.

353
00:45:50,478 --> 00:45:55,758
Think of a car. A Saab 93, perhaps.

354
00:45:55,918 --> 00:46:01,038
It needs a power source, an engine.
And Saab uses piston engines.

355
00:46:01,198 --> 00:46:04,798
And the piston drives a crankshaft.

356
00:46:04,958 --> 00:46:09,615
The clever thing about Saabs
is that they're front-wheel drive.

357
00:46:10,115 --> 00:46:12,915
So it doesn't need a propeller shaft.

358
00:46:13,835 --> 00:46:17,355
- Dad was also into cars.
- Mm.

359
00:46:26,315 --> 00:46:30,275
- You've eaten next to nothing.
- No, I ate at home.

360
00:46:31,515 --> 00:46:36,078
Mmhmm. Why did you eat at home?

361
00:46:41,816 --> 00:46:45,776
So that you could order what you wanted.

362
00:46:46,696 --> 00:46:51,176
I lied to you.
I'm not in the army.

363
00:46:51,336 --> 00:46:55,363
I clean trains.
And my house burned down.

364
00:46:55,856 --> 00:46:58,456
And I'm going to go now.

365
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:02,380
Thanks, it was nice.

366
00:47:16,111 --> 00:47:19,231
She asked what I was interested in.

367
00:47:19,391 --> 00:47:23,751
I answered, "houses", because it was
the only thing that came to mind.

368
00:47:23,911 --> 00:47:26,551
Then she told me about a training course.

369
00:47:26,711 --> 00:47:30,669
Two years later, I was an educated engineer.

370
00:47:32,191 --> 00:47:34,591
- Congratulations!
- Thanks.

371
00:47:37,018 --> 00:47:39,738
Oh, how nice.

372
00:47:43,098 --> 00:47:47,218
Well... let's see what's on your diploma.

373
00:47:47,378 --> 00:47:50,058
- "Ove Lind..."
- Will you marry me?

374
00:47:50,218 --> 00:47:54,018
I thought that if you'd like to, we...

375
00:47:56,178 --> 00:47:58,858
Speak calmly and clearly.

376
00:48:01,738 --> 00:48:05,658
- Will you marry me?
- Yes!

377
00:48:05,818 --> 00:48:07,898
Yes, I will!

378
00:48:29,113 --> 00:48:30,593
Yeah, yeah!

379
00:48:33,233 --> 00:48:36,633
Ow! Ow! Goddammit! Shit!

380
00:48:36,793 --> 00:48:40,353
- What are you doing?
- What are YOU doing?

381
00:48:40,513 --> 00:48:45,635
- You have to drive me to the hospital now.
- For a little nosebleed?

382
00:48:46,135 --> 00:48:48,775
Patrick fell off the ladder.

383
00:48:48,935 --> 00:48:52,135
I could have figured that out, the ass.

384
00:48:53,735 --> 00:48:58,015
Drive yourself. Take the little Japanese
sewing machine you came in the other day.

385
00:48:58,175 --> 00:48:59,895
I don't have a driver's license.

386
00:49:00,055 --> 00:49:02,295
- How old are you?
- 30.

387
00:49:02,455 --> 00:49:06,535
- 30 years old and no driver's license?
- Patrick went in an ambulance and may die.

388
00:49:06,695 --> 00:49:09,615
- But I can take the bus. Thanks!
- I'll drive, then.

389
00:49:09,775 --> 00:49:12,215
Great. At last. Was that so hard?

390
00:49:12,375 --> 00:49:15,175
- Where are you going now?
- To get the kids.

391
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:25,358
- It smells disgusting.
- Mom, I can't breathe.

392
00:49:25,946 --> 00:49:29,266
- Roll down the windows, then.
- No, not the windows.

393
00:49:30,546 --> 00:49:32,866
Roll them up. Roll up the windows.

394
00:49:34,226 --> 00:49:37,626
- Stop!
- Can you go a little faster?

395
00:49:38,906 --> 00:49:42,746
Please, Ove, no one is going to
ticket you at a hospital.

396
00:49:44,746 --> 00:49:47,186
It's only going to take fifteen minutes.

397
00:49:50,201 --> 00:49:54,121
He's in for observation.
I'm going in, so we'll meet here later, OK?

398
00:49:54,281 --> 00:49:58,595
- Wait a second. What about the children?
- They'll have to stay with you.

399
00:49:58,681 --> 00:50:00,801
[speaking Persian]

400
00:50:00,961 --> 00:50:02,721
Hey!

401
00:50:08,782 --> 00:50:11,262
- Book.
- Yeah, I see that.

402
00:50:11,422 --> 00:50:14,502
- Book.
- She wants you to read it.

403
00:50:27,302 --> 00:50:32,174
"Herr Brum has just started to do
what he does every Tuesday."

404
00:50:32,302 --> 00:50:36,382
"When you grow up, you're going
to be a train driver, Guld-Ivar exclaims."

405
00:50:36,815 --> 00:50:40,975
- Book isn't that fun.
- No, I don't like it either.

406
00:50:41,135 --> 00:50:45,375
You have to speak with a story voice,
and sound like a talking bear.

407
00:50:45,535 --> 00:50:49,095
- There aren't any talking bears.
- This one does.

408
00:50:58,975 --> 00:51:04,859
"I've already been a train driver for
a long time, says Herr Brum."

409
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:07,399
Yeah! Exactly like that, very good!

410
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:10,359
"Herr Brum presses a red button."

411
00:51:16,399 --> 00:51:19,799
- "Hundreds of Frantic Honeybees"...
- Hey, kids!

412
00:51:19,959 --> 00:51:24,559
- Look, a clown!
- Beppo the Clown is here! Hey!

413
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:30,084
- Do you want to see a magic trick?
- I was reading a story to the children.

414
00:51:30,584 --> 00:51:33,984
He was reading a story to the children...
But now I'm here.

415
00:51:34,144 --> 00:51:39,024
Do you have a five kronor coin?
I need five kronor for my trick.

416
00:51:39,184 --> 00:51:42,264
Give him a five.

417
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:49,664
Thanks. Now the show begins!

418
00:51:51,664 --> 00:51:54,024
[speaking Persian]

419
00:51:57,241 --> 00:51:59,761
Can you tell me where you live?

420
00:52:00,761 --> 00:52:04,121
- How can you just leave my children?
- I didn't leave your children.

421
00:52:04,281 --> 00:52:09,219
These untalented, pretend
policemen forced me.

422
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:13,199
We decided that your father
was a security risk.

423
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:16,399
I just wanted my five kronor back!

424
00:52:20,359 --> 00:52:22,239
Ta-da!

425
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:24,599
Beppo the Clown thanks you.

426
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:33,239
Hey, wait! This isn't the
five kronor coin that I gave you.

427
00:52:33,399 --> 00:52:36,759
- Poor baby.
- I want my five kronor.

428
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:42,279
Are you a total idiot?

429
00:52:42,938 --> 00:52:45,098
Hey! What are you doing over there?

430
00:52:45,258 --> 00:52:52,078
It's not my fault he had long shoes.
It's not even funny, just impractical.

431
00:52:52,818 --> 00:52:57,978
- Fuck! This is insane!
- Uhhuh. What did I say?

432
00:52:58,458 --> 00:53:02,701
- I'll take it. It's my fine.
- It's my car.

433
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:10,070
- Bye, Ove.
- Bye, Ove!

434
00:53:49,924 --> 00:53:54,484
Intercity 3214 is passing on track 3.

435
00:54:27,066 --> 00:54:29,678
Come help, for fuck's sake!

436
00:54:33,986 --> 00:54:37,146
Are you stupid?
Give me your hand.

437
00:54:37,818 --> 00:54:42,712
Give me your hand now!
Come on, dammit! Are you an idiot?

438
00:54:43,876 --> 00:54:45,876
Dad!

439
00:54:54,116 --> 00:54:57,596
What is it with you?
Do you want to fucking die or something?

440
00:54:58,404 --> 00:55:01,204
- You saved he.
- Him.

441
00:55:01,364 --> 00:55:04,284
"Saved him" is how you say it.

442
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:09,204
Idiot.

443
00:55:13,883 --> 00:55:15,842
Ove!

444
00:55:16,177 --> 00:55:20,963
Nasanin made a drawing for you.
Wait there. Wait there.

445
00:55:23,537 --> 00:55:26,537
Here.
Nasanin made a drawing for you.

446
00:55:26,697 --> 00:55:31,309
The one in color is you.
She always draws you in color.

447
00:55:31,504 --> 00:55:34,224
- Always?
- I have the world's best idea.

448
00:55:34,384 --> 00:55:38,744
You and I should practice driving.
Patrick sure can't, and you're a lot better.

449
00:55:38,904 --> 00:55:41,824
- No, I don't have time.
- I'll pay for fuel, of course.

450
00:55:41,984 --> 00:55:45,504
Isn't it a good idea?
...What was that?

451
00:55:54,234 --> 00:55:57,074
Oh god, poor little thing!

452
00:55:59,114 --> 00:56:02,074
There. Ow, ow, ow.

453
00:56:05,434 --> 00:56:08,114
- Open the door.
- Not in my house.

454
00:56:08,274 --> 00:56:10,474
Open the door now!

455
00:56:17,423 --> 00:56:20,103
God, it's freezing in here.
Grab a blanket.

456
00:56:20,263 --> 00:56:23,143
- Why?
- Quickly. Now!

457
00:57:07,833 --> 00:57:11,313
Hey, man.
I was outside and heard someone shout.

458
00:57:11,473 --> 00:57:14,073
No, I know something faster. Wait.

459
00:57:15,279 --> 00:57:18,199
They say fat people generate a ton of heat.

460
00:57:18,359 --> 00:57:22,319
- I'll get something to dry with.
- No, not in the kitchen!

461
00:57:22,479 --> 00:57:25,519
What is this? Shit, it's so low.

462
00:57:26,159 --> 00:57:30,879
- It's for Sonja. My wife.
- Where is she now?

463
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:34,274
She's... dead.

464
00:57:35,631 --> 00:57:40,590
She cooked like the devil.
I ate here all the time. Right, Ove?

465
00:57:42,391 --> 00:57:46,231
I think she's doing a little better now.
Who's going to take her?

466
00:57:46,391 --> 00:57:49,191
I can't. My children are really allergic.

467
00:57:49,668 --> 00:57:53,453
Oh, fuck, I forgot. I'm allergic, too.

468
00:58:02,916 --> 00:58:06,716
It's not as easy to kill oneself
as one might think.

469
00:58:06,876 --> 00:58:11,996
But she moved in, too.
I have to get rid of her.

470
00:58:12,956 --> 00:58:16,493
But I'll come back later.
I promise, Sonja.

471
00:58:17,764 --> 00:58:22,204
She looked like this from the start.
Don't think I had anything to do with it.

472
00:58:22,684 --> 00:58:25,004
See you soon, then.

473
00:58:50,566 --> 00:58:53,126
I thought you didn't like children.

474
00:58:53,286 --> 00:58:59,246
Of course I like children, but I just
don't know if I'd be a good father.

475
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:12,728
Ove, you'd be the best father
our children could have.

476
00:59:13,919 --> 00:59:17,439
I promise.

477
00:59:31,556 --> 00:59:34,196
Idiot!

478
00:59:34,356 --> 00:59:38,916
Sorry, Ove! Did I hit you?
I'm practicing with Anders now.

479
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:43,780
- Hey, Ove.
- Is that dandy going to teach you to drive?

480
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:48,044
- You didn't want to drive with me.
- We should probably have seatbelts on.

481
00:59:48,204 --> 00:59:51,844
- Right.
- Ah, let me just...

482
00:59:52,724 --> 00:59:54,884
- Sorry.
- Bye!

483
01:00:34,596 --> 01:00:36,996
- Weeee!
- Hey, hey, hey.

484
01:00:37,156 --> 01:00:41,796
Be careful. Please, be careful with Dad's leg.

485
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:46,899
How did it go?

486
01:00:51,059 --> 01:00:54,339
- I'll take her if you get the door.
- Sit here.

487
01:00:59,339 --> 01:01:05,539
Do you have the green sign? One needs
it on the back when practicing driving.

488
01:01:05,699 --> 01:01:10,445
I can't watch an idiot teach
another idiot to drive.

489
01:01:11,259 --> 01:01:12,859
Cool. Thanks!

490
01:01:14,392 --> 01:01:18,632
- Hey, Ove. Everything okay?
- Learn to read the instructions.

491
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:29,005
Hey! What lovely weather for driving practice.

492
01:01:29,902 --> 01:01:35,256
Here's some Persian cookies.
I bake about as good as I drive.

493
01:01:37,942 --> 01:01:40,102
Sit.

494
01:01:46,511 --> 01:01:48,671
Stop. It's red.

495
01:01:48,831 --> 01:01:51,231
I'm useless.

496
01:01:54,431 --> 01:01:58,619
Now it's green. You can drive now.
Don't forget the clutch.

497
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:02,119
God, he's stressing me out!

498
01:02:02,279 --> 01:02:05,549
Start it again. Let go of the key.

499
01:02:06,049 --> 01:02:08,729
Clutch up and gas down.

500
01:02:08,889 --> 01:02:11,889
- That's what I'm doing!
- Leave the clutch...

501
01:02:14,169 --> 01:02:16,329
I can't do it!

502
01:02:18,529 --> 01:02:20,609
No, you bastard!

503
01:02:24,689 --> 01:02:28,009
Have you never been a beginner?
Don't you see the sign?

504
01:02:28,169 --> 01:02:31,249
- Take it easy, little old man.
- "Little old man"!

505
01:02:31,409 --> 01:02:35,049
I'm no fucking "little old man" to you,
you fucking bastard.

506
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:37,129
I'm "big old man".

507
01:02:38,209 --> 01:02:43,649
Honk one more time and it'll be
the last thing you do. Got it?

508
01:02:56,783 --> 01:03:00,063
Now you listen to me.
You've had two children -

509
01:03:00,223 --> 01:03:02,623
- and you're about to spit out a third.

510
01:03:02,783 --> 01:03:06,583
You came here from Iran,
fleeing war and whatever the hell else.

511
01:03:06,743 --> 01:03:10,463
You learned a new language, got
an education and a livelihood.

512
01:03:10,623 --> 01:03:16,013
And you're married to a good-for-nothing.
You can fucking learn to drive, too.

513
01:03:16,513 --> 01:03:19,393
It's not brain surgery.

514
01:03:19,553 --> 01:03:22,633
Start the car now, then just drive.

515
01:03:26,673 --> 01:03:28,113
Idiot.

516
01:03:29,873 --> 01:03:31,633
Good.

517
01:03:39,353 --> 01:03:42,193
No, no, no. I already got it.

518
01:03:44,113 --> 01:03:46,433
No, no, no. Over here.

519
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:05,678
This was Sonja's favorite bakery.

520
01:04:07,511 --> 01:04:12,909
Every Thursday at 1:00 we sat here.
Right at this table.

521
01:04:13,409 --> 01:04:15,809
And ate napoleon pastries?

522
01:04:18,689 --> 01:04:22,289
- How did you know that?
- It's Thursday, 1:00.

523
01:04:30,049 --> 01:04:32,329
What did you do after?

524
01:04:34,249 --> 01:04:36,529
At 2:00 we went home.

525
01:04:37,476 --> 01:04:41,956
Sonja usually read some books,
and Rune and I usually washed the car.

526
01:04:42,116 --> 01:04:45,876
It had to be hand-washed.
No machines scratching the paint.

527
01:04:46,036 --> 01:04:47,596
Rune?

528
01:04:51,236 --> 01:04:56,024
- You don't even talk to each other.
- We did at the time.

529
01:05:04,014 --> 01:05:07,672
Actually, we were probably quite similar.

530
01:05:12,854 --> 01:05:15,774
Stop! Stop, I said!

531
01:05:18,893 --> 01:05:20,733
- Rune.
- Ove.

532
01:05:20,893 --> 01:05:24,973
- We worked together.
- I'll take a shortcut across the field.

533
01:05:26,413 --> 01:05:29,693
- You don't do that.
- You can tell your friends that, too.

534
01:05:29,853 --> 01:05:32,213
We shared the same values.

535
01:05:32,373 --> 01:05:36,093
At the association's first meeting,
I was chosen as Chairman of the Board -

536
01:05:36,253 --> 01:05:41,059
- and Rune as Vice Chairman.
A wise choice, we thought.

537
01:05:41,573 --> 01:05:46,733
We were both probably surprised
to have found a friend.

538
01:05:46,893 --> 01:05:51,853
Until we finally discovered
that little difference between us.

539
01:05:52,353 --> 01:05:56,931
- You drive a Volvo?
- Yeah.

540
01:05:58,193 --> 01:06:01,033
What do you drive?

541
01:06:01,193 --> 01:06:03,153
Saab.

542
01:06:05,732 --> 01:06:10,972
At first, we tried to ignore
the problem and hang out as usual.

543
01:06:11,492 --> 01:06:13,852
We handled it nicely.

544
01:06:14,012 --> 01:06:16,052
It's a boy!

545
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:37,998
The years went by.
We lost touch.

546
01:06:40,932 --> 01:06:45,852
But then, without warning,
the bastard threw me off the Board.

547
01:06:46,852 --> 01:06:48,892
I was so pissed off -

548
01:06:49,052 --> 01:06:53,400
- that I went out and bought a Saab 9000 CS.

549
01:06:55,161 --> 01:06:59,081
Then Rune bought a 960 Executive.

550
01:06:59,241 --> 01:07:01,721
When their boy had grown up -

551
01:07:01,881 --> 01:07:05,241
- he suddenly decided to move to the USA.

552
01:07:05,401 --> 01:07:08,001
They didn't say much after that.

553
01:07:08,836 --> 01:07:12,116
I had just looked at the new Saab 9-5 -

554
01:07:12,276 --> 01:07:16,876
- and thought it was time to put
old grudges behind us.

555
01:07:17,036 --> 01:07:22,036
- We just had to talk again.
- I've been thinking.

556
01:07:22,989 --> 01:07:27,429
Isn't it time we put old grudges behind us?

557
01:07:33,589 --> 01:07:36,069
Of course. We're friends.

558
01:07:37,469 --> 01:07:41,709
- That was when it happened.
- Do you want to see my new car?

559
01:07:44,432 --> 01:07:45,952
BMW.

560
01:07:46,788 --> 01:07:51,068
I turned around and went home.
Rune gave up forever.

561
01:07:51,228 --> 01:07:54,828
Surely one can't drive Volvos his whole life?

562
01:07:56,355 --> 01:07:58,275
It was the last betrayal.

563
01:07:59,694 --> 01:08:03,075
Did you never have children?

564
01:08:09,892 --> 01:08:12,212
It's 2:00 now.

565
01:08:13,412 --> 01:08:19,608
Ove, I have to do the written part as well.
Can you help me?

566
01:08:20,452 --> 01:08:25,188
Uhhuh. It's part of the driver's test.

567
01:08:25,688 --> 01:08:30,488
Thanks. That will be really nice.
You know them already.

568
01:08:31,488 --> 01:08:34,768
- Who?
- The children, of course.

569
01:08:36,282 --> 01:08:42,093
- I don't know if this is such a good idea.
- Me neither. Maybe I should stay home?

570
01:08:42,593 --> 01:08:44,353
No, it's a really good idea.

571
01:08:44,513 --> 01:08:46,673
[speaking Persian]

572
01:08:48,058 --> 01:08:51,218
- Call if anything comes up.
- Bye.

573
01:08:56,458 --> 01:08:59,694
I'm hungry, I'm hungry!

574
01:09:01,467 --> 01:09:06,691
You're against animal testing,
but not against testing on children.

575
01:09:08,026 --> 01:09:10,746
Nasanin wants formula
before we go to bed.

576
01:09:10,906 --> 01:09:15,386
You have to wash the bottle yourself.
Dad can't install the dishwasher.

577
01:09:15,546 --> 01:09:21,266
He says that he's going to throw
the dishwasher out the window.

578
01:09:21,426 --> 01:09:23,826
Come, you have to see my room.

579
01:09:28,527 --> 01:09:32,047
What's important to think about
when building a house?

580
01:09:34,167 --> 01:09:35,927
Water.

581
01:09:36,087 --> 01:09:41,306
- And sewage.
- Exactly. And infrastructure, too.

582
01:09:41,847 --> 01:09:45,807
- Have you built houses before?
- Yes, but no stone houses.

583
01:09:45,967 --> 01:09:49,327
He said I was the best in the class.

584
01:09:52,407 --> 01:09:54,967
Did you agree to this?

585
01:09:58,586 --> 01:10:01,386
No! Wow...

586
01:10:06,628 --> 01:10:08,788
- Sepideh?
- Hi, Mom.

587
01:10:08,948 --> 01:10:11,108
[speaking Persian]

588
01:10:12,348 --> 01:10:13,908
She's sleeping.

589
01:10:32,164 --> 01:10:34,084
What's this?

590
01:10:38,884 --> 01:10:42,084
What are you doing?
You again?

591
01:10:42,244 --> 01:10:48,143
Regarding the woman's bicycle, it says,
"Bicycle parking absolutely forbidden".

592
01:10:48,324 --> 01:10:52,324
Didn't Sonja live here?
I was her student.

593
01:10:52,484 --> 01:10:56,324
I couldn't read or write,
but she didn't think I was stupid.

594
01:10:56,484 --> 01:11:01,677
Then I learned everything. She was great.
Sorry for bothering you.

595
01:11:06,422 --> 01:11:11,832
- Hey! What are you doing with the bike?
- Fixing it for my girlfriend.

596
01:11:12,332 --> 01:11:18,092
Maybe my girlfriend if I fix it.
I have to go to my other job.

597
01:11:18,252 --> 01:11:22,972
I work at a kebab stand, too.
I'm saving for a car. A Renault.

598
01:11:23,132 --> 01:11:26,936
French?
You're going to buy a French car?

599
01:11:28,212 --> 01:11:31,252
Then an old student of yours showed up, too.

600
01:11:31,412 --> 01:11:37,646
So now I have to sort out another thing
before I can come. That's just how it is.

601
01:11:57,796 --> 01:11:59,796
Stop! Hello!

602
01:12:04,687 --> 01:12:09,795
Good. Turn it off.
Now you can parallel park, too.

603
01:12:10,041 --> 01:12:13,961
- I just hit a car.
- It's nothing.

604
01:12:14,801 --> 01:12:19,907
It was a Volvo.
Wait here. I have to do something.

605
01:12:35,812 --> 01:12:39,372
The bike is fixed now.
So you can give it to your girlfriend.

606
01:12:39,532 --> 01:12:43,052
- Did you fix it?
- I just changed the tube.

607
01:12:43,212 --> 01:12:47,132
- You eat kebabs?
- No, why would I do that?

608
01:12:48,492 --> 01:12:51,812
- What's he doing here?
- Why do you have black around your eyes?

609
01:12:51,972 --> 01:12:54,692
- It's makeup.
- I thought girls used that.

610
01:12:54,852 --> 01:12:58,052
- He thinks he looks great with it.
- Mmhmm.

611
01:12:58,212 --> 01:13:01,635
- He won't get any girls.
- I don't want any girls.

612
01:13:02,135 --> 01:13:05,055
- Are you a fag?
- Ove! One doesn't say that.

613
01:13:05,215 --> 01:13:09,815
- He can say what he wants.
- Are you one of those gay people?

614
01:13:13,975 --> 01:13:17,215
Yes. I'm one of those gay people.

615
01:13:17,375 --> 01:13:20,055
I see. What are you fussing about?

616
01:13:21,335 --> 01:13:25,415
Don't say anything about Mirsad.
His Dad doesn't know about it.

617
01:13:25,575 --> 01:13:30,989
I don't go around talking
about what others do.

618
01:13:32,483 --> 01:13:35,923
- You have a much worse problem.
- What's that?

619
01:13:36,083 --> 01:13:38,883
Buying French cars?

620
01:13:40,843 --> 01:13:43,763
It might be good to know
what makes a car run.

621
01:13:43,923 --> 01:13:46,683
It's not as simple as one thinks.

622
01:13:46,843 --> 01:13:48,963
I have to pee.

623
01:13:49,123 --> 01:13:53,483
- We should go over the engine.
- I can't. I'll be quick.

624
01:14:05,955 --> 01:14:09,275
- Hi. You're Ove, right?
- You're parked outside the lines.

625
01:14:09,435 --> 01:14:14,035
Lena Samuelsson, local newspaper.
It's about the accident at the train station.

626
01:14:14,195 --> 01:14:16,075
You saved a man's life there.

627
01:14:16,235 --> 01:14:20,435
- You're wrong, that wasn't me.
- I was there and saw it all.

628
01:14:20,985 --> 01:14:23,945
We have a series called
"The Invisible Heroes".

629
01:14:24,105 --> 01:14:26,225
I think you would be a good fit.

630
01:14:26,385 --> 01:14:29,985
I'm sure a lot of exciting things
happened in your life.

631
01:14:30,145 --> 01:14:33,065
- Will you talk about it?
- No.

632
01:14:33,764 --> 01:14:37,684
I have a letter from the man you saved.
You have to read it.

633
01:14:37,844 --> 01:14:42,157
- It's really touching. Wait...
- I'm ready now.

634
01:14:46,564 --> 01:14:50,284
- There won't be anything.
- Why? What was that?

635
01:14:50,444 --> 01:14:54,564
- I didn't hear anything. Come on.
- Can you open up?

636
01:15:00,964 --> 01:15:06,925
Well, so what? I didn't lock it.
Even an idiot can open it from inside.

637
01:15:07,404 --> 01:15:09,444
Idiots.

638
01:15:11,887 --> 01:15:13,607
Ove!

639
01:15:14,887 --> 01:15:16,927
Wait.

640
01:15:19,967 --> 01:15:25,571
Did you think she'd disappear just
because you locked her in the garage?

641
01:15:33,741 --> 01:15:35,781
God...

642
01:15:35,941 --> 01:15:38,541
You fucking knob.

643
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:47,421
Ove...

644
01:15:55,385 --> 01:16:00,110
- I just thought of something.
- Stop bragging.

645
01:16:06,552 --> 01:16:11,672
Seriously. I can help you clean
your house a bit.

646
01:16:11,832 --> 01:16:16,752
- Put things in boxes and the like.
- That won't be necessary.

647
01:16:16,912 --> 01:16:20,872
- Sonja's things are still out.
- That won't be necessary, I said.

648
01:16:21,032 --> 01:16:25,992
- Wouldn't it be nice to move on?
- I said that you should stop talking!

649
01:16:31,674 --> 01:16:35,034
I've never met Sonja, and she was
certainly wonderful.

650
01:16:35,194 --> 01:16:38,394
But you made her into some sort of saint.

651
01:16:38,554 --> 01:16:41,394
She probably would have
wanted to be a regular Sonja.

652
01:16:41,554 --> 01:16:44,474
A wonderful, but regular Sonja.

653
01:16:44,634 --> 01:16:47,554
- Quiet, I said!
- Don't yell.

654
01:16:54,948 --> 01:16:57,868
The more all the idiots babble about her -

655
01:16:58,028 --> 01:17:03,448
- their noise drowns out that little
memory of her voice that I have left.

656
01:17:06,708 --> 01:17:11,188
There was nothing before Sonja.
And there's nothing after, either.

657
01:17:12,068 --> 01:17:14,468
I exist.

658
01:17:14,628 --> 01:17:18,988
No, you bastard!
Stop, for fuck's sake! Stop!

659
01:17:30,574 --> 01:17:32,614
Wait a second.

660
01:17:39,684 --> 01:17:43,244
If you're done with your
neanderthal manners -

661
01:17:43,404 --> 01:17:45,844
- then we'll probably get along.

662
01:17:46,004 --> 01:17:49,684
- Move.
- Never. Go back, get lost.

663
01:17:51,284 --> 01:17:55,484
If you have a problem with us driving here,
call the administrator at the municipality.

664
01:17:55,644 --> 01:18:00,749
- You can help Rune in other ways.
- I don't give a shit about Rune.

665
01:18:01,249 --> 01:18:02,964
Driving in here isn't permitted.

666
01:18:05,326 --> 01:18:07,726
Not another meter.

667
01:18:16,326 --> 01:18:19,646
What is it with you really, Ove?

668
01:18:19,806 --> 01:18:23,486
I know what it is.
You're paranoid.

669
01:18:23,646 --> 01:18:28,333
I did a little research on you
in the municipality archives -

670
01:18:28,833 --> 01:18:31,433
- and on the internet.

671
01:18:31,593 --> 01:18:34,033
And I know everything.

672
01:18:34,193 --> 01:18:40,003
I've read all your silly posts,
your letters to the authorities.

673
01:18:40,195 --> 01:18:43,075
I know everything about your wife
and her accident.

674
01:18:43,235 --> 01:18:46,755
And how you blame everything
and everyone for it.

675
01:18:48,075 --> 01:18:52,995
But you know, what if it was
just that you weren't enough.

676
01:18:56,275 --> 01:18:57,835
I'm going to report you.

677
01:18:57,995 --> 01:19:00,875
I'm employed by a private
healthcare company.

678
01:19:01,035 --> 01:19:04,835
We only do things that
have already been decided.

679
01:19:04,995 --> 01:19:08,755
You must be scared about that heart, Ove.

680
01:19:16,004 --> 01:19:19,084
What do you know about my heart? Huh?

681
01:19:21,124 --> 01:19:23,964
- What do you know about my heart, then?
- Drive.

682
01:19:24,124 --> 01:19:26,964
Answer! What do you know about my...

683
01:19:27,124 --> 01:19:31,404
Stop the car! Stop the car now!
You fucking idio...

684
01:19:31,564 --> 01:19:34,804
Fucking white shirts! What?!

685
01:19:37,644 --> 01:19:43,235
This is the last warning!
Tomorrow that winter boot will be a moccasin!

686
01:19:43,631 --> 01:19:45,591
Now he's really crazy.

687
01:19:57,791 --> 01:20:00,831
Just forget it.
Forget it, dammit.

688
01:20:02,591 --> 01:20:05,231
No! Fight!

689
01:20:17,764 --> 01:20:21,724
- Fucking white shirts.
- Ove.

690
01:20:23,084 --> 01:20:25,924
Ove, hello? Open up!

691
01:20:32,964 --> 01:20:34,924
Hello, Ove?

692
01:20:37,724 --> 01:20:39,924
How are you?

693
01:21:23,449 --> 01:21:27,609
- Ove! You should stop now.
- It's ready.

694
01:21:27,769 --> 01:21:29,409
Yep.

695
01:21:30,729 --> 01:21:34,808
Wait. Close your eyes first. Close your eyes.

696
01:21:36,049 --> 01:21:40,409
Here. Here. Stop. Ta-da!

697
01:21:41,689 --> 01:21:44,649
- What's this?
- Come, we're going to dance.

698
01:21:44,809 --> 01:21:48,449
- No. No, no.
- Yes! Yes. Come on. Come on.

699
01:21:48,609 --> 01:21:51,009
I can't.

700
01:21:51,169 --> 01:21:53,886
You can dance on the inside.

701
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:27,192
Ove.
You're going to be a father.

702
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:30,660
We're going to be parents!

703
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:34,780
I love you, Ove.

704
01:22:34,940 --> 01:22:37,580
I love you, too.

705
01:22:38,564 --> 01:22:42,684
- But then we have to buy a station wagon.
- Yeah, or a cradle.

706
01:22:44,284 --> 01:22:46,884
Good idea. I'll build one.

707
01:24:23,043 --> 01:24:25,683
Fucking rascals!
What are you doing?

708
01:24:25,843 --> 01:24:27,443
Uhh...

709
01:24:31,043 --> 01:24:34,163
- We just wanted to ask something...
- What?!

710
01:24:34,923 --> 01:24:38,803
Mirsad was kicked out of his house.
I thought that maybe he could live here.

711
01:24:39,832 --> 01:24:44,078
Here?
Do you think this is a fucking hotel?

712
01:24:45,512 --> 01:24:47,512
Mirsad came out today.

713
01:24:47,672 --> 01:24:51,472
I told my dad that I was
one of those gay people.

714
01:24:51,632 --> 01:24:53,592
And he hates fags.

715
01:24:53,752 --> 01:24:57,232
He'd kill himself if any of his children were.

716
01:24:57,392 --> 01:25:00,312
But yeah, yeah, whatever. We're going.

717
01:25:01,512 --> 01:25:04,952
Sonja always helped other people.

718
01:25:22,096 --> 01:25:24,176
Okay, come on, then.

719
01:25:49,284 --> 01:25:51,324
Good morning.

720
01:25:53,324 --> 01:25:58,084
I made some toast, if that's okay.
And I made a little coffee, too.

721
01:26:00,067 --> 01:26:03,827
- I'm going to go on my rounds.
- Aren't you going to have coffee first?

722
01:26:05,187 --> 01:26:08,507
I made a little bit here.
Sandwiches with cheese and stuff.

723
01:26:14,747 --> 01:26:16,827
Before the rounds?

724
01:26:34,029 --> 01:26:36,869
No, I have to go do the rounds now.

725
01:26:37,029 --> 01:26:39,349
Can I come along?

726
01:26:40,629 --> 01:26:43,229
It's a free country.

727
01:26:43,389 --> 01:26:44,949
Oh? Okay.

728
01:26:48,829 --> 01:26:50,789
Wait!

729
01:26:54,446 --> 01:26:57,606
Hey. Can I come with?

730
01:26:57,766 --> 01:27:00,366
I started exercising.

731
01:27:00,526 --> 01:27:03,406
- Hey. Jimmy.
- Hey. Mirsad.

732
01:27:07,949 --> 01:27:10,789
- Did you fight with your father?
- Yeah.

733
01:27:10,949 --> 01:27:13,629
He didn't jump for joy.

734
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:30,680
- Did you hear about Rune?
- No.

735
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:34,185
They're picking him up tomorrow.
He's going to go in the institution.

736
01:27:34,445 --> 01:27:38,365
Bullshit. It takes years before it happens.

737
01:27:38,525 --> 01:27:40,605
Ask me, I know.

738
01:27:40,765 --> 01:27:44,925
I promise. The decision was made.
They're coming tomorrow.

739
01:27:45,085 --> 01:27:49,445
She appealed three years ago.
So now they'll be separated.

740
01:27:49,744 --> 01:27:55,374
Three years. Lies.
Sonja would have known about that.

741
01:27:55,874 --> 01:27:58,954
- Me too.
- Anita said nothing to Sonja.

742
01:27:59,114 --> 01:28:02,514
- She didn't want you to know.
- Why didn't she want us to know?

743
01:28:02,674 --> 01:28:04,834
She didn't want to ask for help.

744
01:28:04,994 --> 01:28:08,994
She said that you had enough
problems of your own.

745
01:28:10,194 --> 01:28:12,554
She said that?

746
01:28:12,714 --> 01:28:17,514
She said we shouldn't know because
we had enough of our own problems?

747
01:28:17,674 --> 01:28:19,914
Yeah, so what?

748
01:28:23,866 --> 01:28:27,586
Idiot. That's what I've been.

749
01:28:37,386 --> 01:28:40,226
You mustn't be angry with me, Sonja.

750
01:28:42,499 --> 01:28:45,459
It's hard to admit that one's been wrong.

751
01:28:45,619 --> 01:28:48,659
Especially when one's been
wrong for a long time.

752
01:28:50,419 --> 01:28:52,419
I'm sorry.

753
01:28:55,859 --> 01:28:58,779
But now it's going to be put right.

754
01:29:03,021 --> 01:29:06,941
I know how you tend to worry when I fight.

755
01:29:07,101 --> 01:29:10,301
But this time, I think you'll agree with me.

756
01:29:10,461 --> 01:29:12,461
Now it's fucking war!

757
01:29:12,621 --> 01:29:16,381
Give me every single paper between
you and the municipality -

758
01:29:16,541 --> 01:29:21,301
- and insurance office, county, church.
I want the works on Rune.

759
01:29:26,308 --> 01:29:30,468
To cancel your service, press star.

760
01:29:32,188 --> 01:29:35,108
Can I borrow your phone?

761
01:29:35,828 --> 01:29:38,428
For the neighbors.

762
01:29:38,588 --> 01:29:43,868
It doesn't fucking matter if
we've already appealed.

763
01:29:44,028 --> 01:29:49,628
Because there's a higher court.
Can't you read? Are you illiterate?

764
01:29:51,290 --> 01:29:54,010
Illiterate! Hello?

765
01:29:55,570 --> 01:29:57,410
Hello?!

766
01:29:58,851 --> 01:30:01,539
How can one reason with
people who hang up?

767
01:30:02,039 --> 01:30:05,959
- How can you reason if you're just yelling?
- They're not listening.

768
01:30:06,119 --> 01:30:08,199
Sit down.

769
01:30:09,799 --> 01:30:11,879
Turn that off.

770
01:30:14,222 --> 01:30:17,182
It's the same people all the time.

771
01:30:17,342 --> 01:30:20,422
The same people.
That's how it's always been.

772
01:30:20,582 --> 01:30:24,502
Their names are different,
but they're the same.

773
01:30:24,662 --> 01:30:27,822
The only place for a municipality bastard.

774
01:30:27,982 --> 01:30:30,822
Those fucking white shirts.

775
01:30:35,407 --> 01:30:37,647
Listen to yourself.

776
01:30:38,767 --> 01:30:42,447
You said to me that one never
gives up, right?

777
01:30:42,607 --> 01:30:46,407
Then you sit there
and feel sorry for yourself.

778
01:30:46,567 --> 01:30:50,127
Because you had it bad,
everyone's an idiot...

779
01:30:50,287 --> 01:30:52,767
So you just give up.

780
01:30:52,927 --> 01:30:59,352
All because you think everyone on
this planet can manage without help.

781
01:31:00,226 --> 01:31:02,386
But you know what, Ove?

782
01:31:02,546 --> 01:31:07,386
No one manages alone. No one.
Not even you.

783
01:31:07,546 --> 01:31:09,946
You can go now.

784
01:31:10,906 --> 01:31:15,822
You can go, I said.
I don't have to energy for you anymore.

785
01:31:39,855 --> 01:31:42,495
It was her idea from the start.

786
01:31:42,655 --> 01:31:48,142
That we'd travel together, just she and I,
before the child came.

787
01:31:49,295 --> 01:31:52,655
She was adamant that we
should go by bus.

788
01:31:52,815 --> 01:31:57,272
Because that was more romantic, she said.

789
01:31:58,841 --> 01:32:01,321
And I didn't object.

790
01:32:01,481 --> 01:32:05,401
It was a little cheaper, too.

791
01:32:36,324 --> 01:32:42,200
Down in Spain, Sonja thought
that one should do as the Romans do.

792
01:32:43,164 --> 01:32:47,164
I discovered that the Spaniards
had a lot to learn -

793
01:32:47,324 --> 01:32:51,004
- when it came to Swedish
building standards.

794
01:32:59,011 --> 01:33:01,011
We had it good.

795
01:33:02,051 --> 01:33:05,051
In the evenings, we went out and ate.

796
01:33:07,611 --> 01:33:10,251
We saved a little food from the lunch buffet -

797
01:33:10,411 --> 01:33:13,851
- that made for a fine dinner outside.

798
01:33:17,371 --> 01:33:19,171
Skål.

799
01:33:23,851 --> 01:33:27,171
One day it was time to go home.

800
01:33:33,284 --> 01:33:35,204
Hola.

801
01:33:38,904 --> 01:33:41,704
- Hola.
- No thanks. No, no!

802
01:33:43,424 --> 01:33:46,144
- What did he say?
- He seems happy.

803
01:33:46,304 --> 01:33:49,904
We come, we come, from
Pepperkaker land.

804
01:33:50,064 --> 01:33:53,864
On the road, on the road,
we wander hand in hand.

805
01:33:55,535 --> 01:33:57,375
- Let them be, Ove.
- What?

806
01:33:57,535 --> 01:34:00,175
- They're having fun.
- They are?

807
01:34:12,855 --> 01:34:17,615
On the bus, Sonja wanted me
to feel her stomach -

808
01:34:17,775 --> 01:34:22,061
- because the child, she kicked in there.

809
01:34:22,180 --> 01:34:24,940
Here, feel.

810
01:34:29,020 --> 01:34:32,622
- Do you feel it?
- It's constant.

811
01:34:36,220 --> 01:34:38,620
I'm just going to go to the toilet.

812
01:35:53,978 --> 01:35:55,978
Sonja?

813
01:36:10,158 --> 01:36:12,558
Sonja? Sonja?

814
01:36:20,078 --> 01:36:21,758
Sonja!

815
01:36:25,238 --> 01:36:27,718
Help! Help!

816
01:36:36,998 --> 01:36:39,078
You can go in to her.

817
01:36:58,639 --> 01:37:01,559
I probably sat with her for a week.

818
01:37:01,719 --> 01:37:06,399
Not a soul dared to talk to me.
And that was probably for the best.

819
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:09,919
Until one day...

820
01:37:12,954 --> 01:37:16,314
They said that Sonja would never wake up.

821
01:37:16,474 --> 01:37:19,634
Don't you fucking say that to me!

822
01:37:21,274 --> 01:37:24,274
And then, inexplicably, it happened.

823
01:37:25,123 --> 01:37:30,371
It was as if the best and the worst
happened at the same time.

824
01:37:57,881 --> 01:38:02,161
The day after, I was forced to tell her
about everything that happened.

825
01:38:30,830 --> 01:38:33,990
About a life that no longer existed.

826
01:38:36,070 --> 01:38:41,316
In the midst of that pain,
I felt a kind of inner strength.

827
01:38:41,816 --> 01:38:46,976
At first, I turned that anger into
something fruitful.

828
01:38:51,856 --> 01:38:55,176
Sonja continued to study.

829
01:38:55,336 --> 01:38:58,616
She had a year left on her teaching degree.

830
01:38:59,160 --> 01:39:02,480
But when she finished, there were no jobs.

831
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:04,680
I'm really sorry, but you have good grades.

832
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:08,720
At that time, the schools weren't
handicap-accessible.

833
01:39:11,768 --> 01:39:17,507
But then one day,
Sonja saw an ad in the paper.

834
01:39:18,168 --> 01:39:22,848
A class where they bundled all
the letter combinations that existed -

835
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:26,872
- before the combinations
were even invented.

836
01:39:27,618 --> 01:39:31,378
Your CV seems really good,
but we're unable

837
01:39:31,538 --> 01:39:34,698
to take on a disabled teacher.

838
01:39:37,282 --> 01:39:41,922
Then I went into the great darkness.
I wanted to obliterate everyone.

839
01:39:42,082 --> 01:39:45,682
Every bastard.
The bus company, the driver -

840
01:39:45,842 --> 01:39:48,602
- the vineyard, the travel
company... everyone.

841
01:39:48,762 --> 01:39:52,002
I wrote to the Spanish and
Swedish governments -

842
01:39:52,162 --> 01:39:54,082
- but no one cared.

843
01:39:54,242 --> 01:39:58,362
The idea is that one expands the entrance...

844
01:39:58,522 --> 01:40:03,202
They didn't even want to build a ramp
so that Sonja could start at the school.

845
01:40:04,184 --> 01:40:08,304
I wrote to everyone
to try to get some justice

846
01:40:08,464 --> 01:40:11,704
for something I didn't even
know the answer to myself.

847
01:40:11,864 --> 01:40:16,384
Until finally, Sonja...
She was the strongest of all.

848
01:40:17,464 --> 01:40:19,024
Ove.

849
01:40:23,972 --> 01:40:27,332
Either we die or we live.

850
01:40:32,569 --> 01:40:37,649
That night, I took the car and built
what was needed in one night.

851
01:40:51,983 --> 01:40:55,783
The next day, Sonja was able to start working.

852
01:41:00,663 --> 01:41:02,383
Welcome.

853
01:41:06,883 --> 01:41:10,403
Homer wrote The Iliad about the Trojan war.

854
01:41:10,563 --> 01:41:13,163
But when was The Iliad written?

855
01:41:13,323 --> 01:41:15,563
- David?
- The year 700.

856
01:41:15,723 --> 01:41:18,323
- B.C.
- Tool.

857
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:28,800
Let's say hello to Richard Stenebo.
Welcome to our class.

858
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:31,440
- Hi, Richard!
- Welcome.

859
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:37,280
I'm not lying.
In one year, the same student could

860
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:41,880
cite 400-year-old poetry
with ease at graduation.

861
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:46,280
So infinite in her skills.

862
01:41:46,440 --> 01:41:50,760
So like a god in her form -

863
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:53,600
- and her actions.

864
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:56,120
A model of an animal.

865
01:41:57,240 --> 01:41:59,720
Yet, to me...

866
01:42:01,240 --> 01:42:04,482
...she's only dust.

867
01:42:11,437 --> 01:42:13,477
Bravo!

868
01:42:13,637 --> 01:42:16,597
She fought for what was good.

869
01:42:20,917 --> 01:42:24,621
For the child she never had.

870
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:32,720
She died six months ago - from cancer.

871
01:42:35,680 --> 01:42:39,533
And I promised to follow her.

872
01:43:10,009 --> 01:43:15,246
- Today's the day. Is he ready?
- Don't come any farther.

873
01:43:17,006 --> 01:43:20,966
You've had three years to prepare
for this nice and peacefully.

874
01:43:21,886 --> 01:43:24,806
The decision was made.

875
01:43:24,966 --> 01:43:29,446
- We're doing this for your sake, Anita.
- What about love?

876
01:43:29,606 --> 01:43:33,848
Separating when you need each other most?

877
01:43:35,235 --> 01:43:41,512
The problem is that he has no idea
where he is 24 hours a day.

878
01:43:41,875 --> 01:43:43,915
No, but I know.

879
01:43:44,075 --> 01:43:45,755
Oh!

880
01:43:46,715 --> 01:43:50,475
- And who's going to take care of him?
- I will.

881
01:43:50,635 --> 01:43:56,141
- With a little help... from...
- A little help? From who?

882
01:43:58,671 --> 01:44:03,151
- Hi, how nice. Lena, from the local paper.
- Hey.

883
01:44:03,992 --> 01:44:10,392
I have the last three years' statements
from the healthcare company Konsensus -

884
01:44:10,552 --> 01:44:14,952
- that you're a shareholder of.
There's a marginal profit reported.

885
01:44:15,112 --> 01:44:19,272
At the same time, I have statements
from a bank in the Canary Islands.

886
01:44:19,432 --> 01:44:23,512
It's had millions in deposits.

887
01:44:24,012 --> 01:44:26,972
- Where did you get them?
- On the internet.

888
01:44:27,132 --> 01:44:30,212
My editor would be happy to run this -

889
01:44:30,372 --> 01:44:34,732
- but the decision is mine, if
you understand what I mean.

890
01:44:56,067 --> 01:44:58,707
He left right away.

891
01:45:00,427 --> 01:45:03,347
It was better in our time.

892
01:45:03,507 --> 01:45:07,467
Then, people at least
fought for their principles.

893
01:45:44,856 --> 01:45:47,856
Ove! Ove!

894
01:45:49,656 --> 01:45:51,576
Ove! Call an ambulance!

895
01:45:51,736 --> 01:45:55,896
Don't let the fucking ambulance
drive into the association.

896
01:46:05,988 --> 01:46:08,708
Over by the window.

897
01:46:35,919 --> 01:46:39,999
Hi. Parvaneh, you're listed as next of kin.

898
01:46:40,856 --> 01:46:46,096
Your dad suffers from a heart condition.
One could say his heart is too big.

899
01:46:47,776 --> 01:46:53,485
- Sorry, too big?
- Yes. But he'll survive.

900
01:47:02,382 --> 01:47:03,862
Ove!

901
01:47:04,022 --> 01:47:07,462
You're too fucking sick to die.

902
01:47:20,462 --> 01:47:23,422
Oh shit, I think this is the day, Ove!

903
01:47:24,942 --> 01:47:26,622
Shit!

904
01:47:33,946 --> 01:47:36,706
It was just gathering dust.

905
01:47:36,866 --> 01:47:40,626
- But it was never used.
- It's really nice, Ove. Thanks.

906
01:47:40,786 --> 01:47:44,386
- It might need to be painted a bit.
- Here, hold the baby.

907
01:47:44,546 --> 01:47:47,626
I'm going to show it to Patrick.

908
01:47:58,906 --> 01:48:01,066
Hey, you.

909
01:48:09,626 --> 01:48:12,106
Just lie down here...

910
01:48:19,010 --> 01:48:21,610
You're happy.

911
01:48:28,210 --> 01:48:33,930
- Yeah, you're getting something, too.
- An ipad! Thanks, grandpa!

912
01:48:35,812 --> 01:48:39,052
I know that feeling.

913
01:48:39,212 --> 01:48:41,812
It's like when I buy a new car.

914
01:48:47,572 --> 01:48:50,252
This is the life.

915
01:49:08,068 --> 01:49:12,131
Hey...
It isn't shoveled in front of Ove's house.

916
01:49:12,631 --> 01:49:15,911
- Who cares.
- But it's 8:00.

917
01:49:16,071 --> 01:49:18,951
It's time for his rounds.

918
01:49:24,711 --> 01:49:26,591
Ove!

919
01:49:55,544 --> 01:49:59,344
Don't be worried that I did something stupid.

920
01:49:59,504 --> 01:50:04,304
If you're reading this, the doctor's
diagnosis was right.

921
01:50:04,464 --> 01:50:07,544
She said my heart was too big.

922
01:50:07,704 --> 01:50:11,744
But even if that sounds nice,
it's not so good.

923
01:50:12,664 --> 01:50:16,144
Sooner or later, one pays for it.

I wish for the funeral to be
in a church as it should be.

925
01:50:21,406 --> 01:50:26,486
No fuss with ashes spread in the wind
or any of that nonsense.

01:50:27,321 --> 01:50:30,721
I want it done quietly, with only
those closest to me -

927
01:50:30,881 --> 01:50:33,721
- who think that I've done right by me.

928
01:50:33,881 --> 01:50:37,741
The cat eats tuna twice a day, and
doesn't want shit in other people's houses.

929
01:50:38,241 --> 01:50:39,259

930
01:50:39,521 --> 01:50:43,801
And for fuck's sake, don't let any
fucking cars in the association.
