If you're going to use
a false name,

143
00:13:17,222 --> 00:13:18,765
you could at least
use Haruo Sato,

144
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:22,598

to write in the dedication.

dedicated to "Birdman Hilltop."

183
00:15:38,613 --> 00:15:41,650
There's a textbook on sex.
It'll help you tonight.

184
00:15:41,824 --> 00:15:43,320
Take them.

185
00:15:44,327 --> 00:15:47,993
I get what you're feeling.
- Like hell you do.

186
00:15:48,122 --> 00:15:50,697
"To Miss Whosit Suzuki."

187
00:15:57,966 --> 00:16:00,255
Pick them up.
They're expensive.

188
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,409
I feel humiliated!

189
00:16:26,536 --> 00:16:28,328
<i>Then steal something.</i>

190
00:16:28,496 --> 00:16:32,281
<i>This is Ali Baba</i>

191
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:36,375
<i>Town of mystery</i>

192
00:16:37,005 --> 00:16:42,213
<i>Someone asks you</i>

193
00:16:42,719 --> 00:16:46,800
<i>Morning in the sea</i>

194
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:50,260
<i>Noon on a hill</i>

195
00:16:50,435 --> 00:16:53,306
<i>Night in the river</i>

196
00:16:53,438 --> 00:16:56,012
<i>Who is it?</i>

197
00:16:56,566 --> 00:17:00,481
<i>Bero-bero, a little boy</i>

198
00:17:00,737 --> 00:17:02,730
<i>This is Ali Baba</i>

199
00:17:02,906 --> 00:17:04,484
<i>Town of mystery</i>

200
00:17:06,743 --> 00:17:12,948
<i>An unsolvable solvable riddle</i>

201
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:18,744
<i>Tonight the owl won't hoot</i>

202
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:06,094
Congratulations.

203
00:18:09,097 --> 00:18:12,763
Wait.
You've got to see me in it.

204
00:18:12,934 --> 00:18:18,439
<i>Like a camel's humps</i>

205
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:22,605
<i>Or two gourds</i>

206
00:18:22,694 --> 00:18:29,693
<i>How mysteriously
we resemble one another</i>

207
00:18:30,326 --> 00:18:34,159
<i>From the number of our hairs
to what it looks like down there</i>

208
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:39,918
<i>We even love the same guy</i>

209
00:18:40,461 --> 00:18:43,796
<i>We even say the same things</i>

210
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:48,385
<i>In our sleep</i>

211
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,634
<i>On a lonely night</i>

212
00:18:52,807 --> 00:18:55,015
<i>We embrace before a mirror</i>

213
00:18:55,518 --> 00:18:58,935
<i>Even a wilted pomegranate blooms</i>

214
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:02,775
<i>A lonely winter's night</i>

215
00:19:03,318 --> 00:19:05,774
<i>We gouge out
our Siamese cat's eyes</i>

216
00:19:05,904 --> 00:19:08,360
<i>And stuff them in our mouths</i>

217
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:12,660
<i>The dead give birth in their graves</i>

218
00:19:12,827 --> 00:19:17,075
<i>As long as we</i>

219
00:19:17,206 --> 00:19:19,745
<i>Resemble each other so</i>

220
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:23,709
<i>There's nothing at all</i>

221
00:19:24,214 --> 00:19:26,254
<i>In the world</i>

222
00:19:26,382 --> 00:19:29,337
<i>The whole world is quiet</i>

223
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:33,177
<i>A pig's navel</i>

224
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:38,976
<i>You should have told me before.</i>

225
00:19:40,563 --> 00:19:42,723
So how was it?

226
00:19:42,899 --> 00:19:44,394
<i>Not at all.</i>

227
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:46,644
I'm asking whether
it hurt or not.

228
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:48,352
<i>Not at all.</i>

229
00:19:48,547 --> 00:19:51,039
You actually enjoyed
your first time?

230
00:19:51,241 --> 00:19:52,784
Not at all.

231
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:04,038
Will you clean out my ears?

232
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:07,038
Not at all.

233
00:20:08,091 --> 00:20:10,260
- Maybe the ear pick...
- Not at all.

234
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:14,424
enjoys it more than the ear...
or not.

235
00:20:14,597 --> 00:20:17,516
My anger and frustration
aren't going away at all.

236
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:18,847
PARIS

237
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:20,846
PRESIDENT DE GAULLE

238
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,559
GREAT VICTORY

239
00:20:26,484 --> 00:20:29,486
<i>- What was that?
- Why's she doing that?</i>

240
00:20:39,831 --> 00:20:41,456
Is she nuts?

241
00:20:54,304 --> 00:20:56,262
Hey, cut it out!

242
00:21:00,268 --> 00:21:01,847
Stop that!

243
00:21:01,978 --> 00:21:04,351
Stop that!

244
00:21:11,404 --> 00:21:12,780
Take her home!

245
00:21:14,324 --> 00:21:16,816
- Let's go.
- You go!

246
00:21:18,536 --> 00:21:21,075
- Listen, you --
- Let me go!

247
00:21:22,874 --> 00:21:24,535
Let me go!

248
00:21:26,794 --> 00:21:28,254
No!

249
00:21:30,173 --> 00:21:31,917
Let me go!

250
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,643
Shut up!

251
00:21:56,915 --> 00:22:00,368
SUMMER 1968 -- MONDAY
UMEKO SUZUKI WAS HELD

252
00:22:00,536 --> 00:22:03,408
AT YOTSUYA POLICE STATION
FROM 4:00 TO 9:00 A.M.

253
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:07,372
MR. TANABE GOT
UMEKO SUZUKI OUT OF JAIL.

254
00:22:07,543 --> 00:22:11,412
THIS WAS
AT UMEKO'S REQUEST.

255
00:22:11,589 --> 00:22:14,757
<i>I heard about you two</i>

256
00:22:14,926 --> 00:22:16,754
<i>from Mr. Tanabe.</i>

257
00:22:16,928 --> 00:22:20,013
<i>I think I understand
a few things about you.</i>

258
00:22:20,723 --> 00:22:22,847
<i>My approach is very rigorous,</i>

259
00:22:23,017 --> 00:22:26,719
so I'd like you to tell me

260
00:22:26,896 --> 00:22:29,684
a bit about yourselves.

261
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:33,517
What I think is --
Sorry to do all the talking.

262
00:22:33,695 --> 00:22:36,068
Take off your jacket.
It's so hot.

263
00:22:36,656 --> 00:22:39,113
We must gradually
lift the veils.

264
00:22:39,576 --> 00:22:41,403
After all, a boy and a girl --

265
00:22:41,786 --> 00:22:44,871
it's quite normal and natural.

266
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,875
From what I've heard,
my feeling is that

267
00:22:48,042 --> 00:22:52,456
the young man is too --

268
00:22:52,589 --> 00:22:55,460
I'll put it this way:
He's a pretty boy.

269
00:22:56,092 --> 00:23:00,257
The young woman
is too proper and mature.

270
00:23:00,763 --> 00:23:03,302
That's the fundamental problem.

271
00:23:03,474 --> 00:23:06,429
Well, neither of you
is very mature,

272
00:23:06,811 --> 00:23:09,105
but the young man --

273
00:23:09,105 --> 00:23:13,602
Mr. Mountaintop?
No, Mr. Hilltop, was it?

274
00:23:13,807 --> 00:23:17,806
You're still suckling
at the breast.

275
00:23:18,781 --> 00:23:21,108
You're still a breast-feeding baby,
so to speak.

276
00:23:21,409 --> 00:23:23,403
As for you --
Umeko, was it?

277
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:28,747
You seem quite mature,
but I don't think you really are.

278
00:23:28,917 --> 00:23:31,753
I don't think either of you
really understands

279
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,293
what's happening.

280
00:23:36,507 --> 00:23:41,633
I'd like you to look at some
of Takehisa Yumeji's work.

281
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:44,552
Have you seen <i>shunga</i> erotic prints?
- Yes.

282
00:23:44,682 --> 00:23:46,759
- How about you?
- No.

283
00:23:46,976 --> 00:23:49,053
You look at them first.

284
00:23:51,856 --> 00:23:54,182
Yumeji didn't do many <i>shunga.</i>

285
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:56,352
Yes, they're rare.

286
00:23:57,612 --> 00:23:58,941
This is quite --

287
00:23:59,072 --> 00:24:03,402
Yes, please pass each to her
when you're done.

288
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:11,244
You too, look closely.

289
00:24:21,844 --> 00:24:24,514
This one kind of gets to me.

290
00:24:24,847 --> 00:24:27,137
- It makes you feel something?
- Yes.

291
00:24:28,518 --> 00:24:32,267
So what she's saying...

292
00:24:33,523 --> 00:24:37,356
about this drawing
seems to indicate

293
00:24:37,527 --> 00:24:40,066
that she has a desire
for group sex.

294
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:44,232
You also seem to have

295
00:24:44,367 --> 00:24:47,535
homosexual tendencies.

296
00:24:49,372 --> 00:24:51,449
Homosexual tendencies?

297
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:53,872
Yes, a desire for women.

298
00:24:55,503 --> 00:24:58,042
People call it
lesbianism these days.

299
00:24:58,464 --> 00:25:02,795
This drawing is of two women
and one man.

300
00:25:03,011 --> 00:25:05,929
Since it made
such an impression on you,

301
00:25:06,055 --> 00:25:08,132
I think you have such tendencies.

302
00:25:08,308 --> 00:25:09,803
As for you...

303
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:16,224
I think you're --

304
00:25:19,402 --> 00:25:21,111
You're still not being honest.

305
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,988
You have to get naked.

306
00:25:23,573 --> 00:25:28,568
One can't become naked
just by talking.

307
00:25:36,085 --> 00:25:39,040
There are still many veils.

308
00:25:40,632 --> 00:25:42,709
At least take off your tie.

309
00:25:45,261 --> 00:25:49,342
Come on.
Make yourself comfortable.

310
00:25:49,724 --> 00:25:53,224
You still haven't bared
your souls to me.

311
00:25:53,311 --> 00:25:54,890
either of you.

312
00:25:55,813 --> 00:25:57,937
I mean...

313
00:25:59,067 --> 00:26:02,353
your waist --
I mean your hips.

314
00:26:02,987 --> 00:26:04,103
they're wide for a boy.

315
00:26:04,781 --> 00:26:07,107
They're as wide as my chest.

316
00:26:08,284 --> 00:26:09,945
Exactly as wide?

317
00:26:10,954 --> 00:26:14,537
- Have you taken your measurements?
- No, I haven't.

318
00:26:14,707 --> 00:26:17,413
But judging from my trouser size --

319
00:26:17,794 --> 00:26:20,037
That's good.

320
00:26:20,213 --> 00:26:22,705
But at the same time,

321
00:26:22,882 --> 00:26:25,920
I think it shows
a certain weakness.

322
00:26:26,094 --> 00:26:28,882
I don't mean to offend,

323
00:26:29,013 --> 00:26:32,846
but I feel you have
many feminine elements.

324
00:26:34,394 --> 00:26:37,349
I want to see
the two of you naked...

325
00:26:39,315 --> 00:26:41,143
in both body and soul.

326
00:26:41,317 --> 00:26:43,477
As for you, Umeko...

327
00:26:43,695 --> 00:26:47,480
I think your narcissism --

328
00:26:47,574 --> 00:26:50,860
that is, loving only yourself.

329
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:55,242
I think that deep inside you

330
00:26:55,623 --> 00:26:58,080
there are lesbian feelings,

331
00:26:58,209 --> 00:27:00,618
or you're susceptible
to lesbian tendencies.

332
00:27:00,795 --> 00:27:05,008
Maybe it stems
from your bond with your mother

333
00:27:05,174 --> 00:27:08,176
or some other woman.

334
00:27:09,053 --> 00:27:13,716
Then that turned into narcissism,
focusing solely on yourself.

335
00:27:15,268 --> 00:27:17,842
That's why you won't get naked.

336
00:27:18,021 --> 00:27:22,185
I think you want
to protect yourself.

337
00:27:24,819 --> 00:27:26,480
What do you think?

338
00:27:26,988 --> 00:27:30,239
I think both of you

339
00:27:30,575 --> 00:27:33,244
are wearing

340
00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:37,202
a kind of armor
that's weighing you down.

341
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:42,788
You're both basically
incapable of anything.

342
00:27:42,921 --> 00:27:46,006
That's how I feel.
I want you to undress.

343
00:27:46,174 --> 00:27:50,007
<i>Could you get naked
just because someone said to?</i>

344
00:27:50,178 --> 00:27:54,924
<i>If I'd been alone -- physically,
personally, panhumanly--</i>

345
00:27:55,058 --> 00:27:57,764
<i>I would have stripped naked
right there.</i>

346
00:27:58,394 --> 00:28:03,223
<i>But it’s about whether she and I
can bare ourselves to each other.</i>

347
00:28:03,358 --> 00:28:05,268
<i>Besides, she was a virgin.</i>

348
00:28:05,401 --> 00:28:07,775
<i>She left her cherry blossom
on my sheets.</i>

349
00:28:07,946 --> 00:28:12,407
<i>"Not at all... not at all..."
That's all she could say.</i>

350
00:28:12,951 --> 00:28:15,787
<i>For things to end that way
with a girl like that--</i>

351
00:28:16,496 --> 00:28:19,830
<i>If she pops into my head
over breakfast one day when I'm 80,</i>

352
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:21,993
<i>I think it would bother me.</i>

353
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:27,499
<i>People say that without sexual
liberation, human beings won't be free.</i>

354
00:28:27,757 --> 00:28:31,044
<i>If all the girls in the world
stopped saying "not at all,"</i>

355
00:28:31,219 --> 00:28:34,055
<i>the world would stay the same.</i>

356
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:37,719
<i>I'm sure
Professor Takahashi wanted us</i>

357
00:28:37,892 --> 00:28:40,182
<i>to take the first step by stripping.</i>

358
00:28:40,311 --> 00:28:44,310
<i>He told us to forget
about the world and strip bare,</i>

359
00:28:44,482 --> 00:28:46,392
<i>but it was impossible.</i>

360
00:28:46,776 --> 00:28:49,445
<i>Mr. Tanabe's efforts
were also in vain.</i>

361
00:28:50,196 --> 00:28:53,115
<i>It was a difficult discussion.
I should have ended it.</i>

362
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:57,534
<i>I didn't have to make such a big deal
out of a cherry blossom.</i>

363
00:28:59,289 --> 00:29:02,207
It's pretty vulgar of them
to come ask us for sex advice.

364
00:29:02,375 --> 00:29:05,543
Yet we don't really
have much choice

365
00:29:05,628 --> 00:29:07,373
but to try to respond.

366
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:12,632
But nobody present tonight
is really an authority on the subject.

367
00:29:12,802 --> 00:29:14,630
How would you know?

368
00:29:14,846 --> 00:29:16,389
That's insulting!

369
00:29:16,514 --> 00:29:18,342
No, it isn't.

370
00:29:18,808 --> 00:29:22,261
Nobody here
has a great sex life.

371
00:29:22,395 --> 00:29:23,890
Nonsense!

372
00:29:24,981 --> 00:29:30,486
Okay, let's hear what the guy
who said "Nonsense!" has to say.

373
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:33,988
Do you have a solution
to their troubles?

374
00:29:34,157 --> 00:29:36,150
Well, how do you
define satisfaction?

375
00:29:36,326 --> 00:29:39,162
You're the only one here
who's satisfied.

376
00:29:39,287 --> 00:29:41,197
No, I'm satisfied too.

377
00:29:41,456 --> 00:29:44,790
I'm not satisfied!
Absolutely not!

378
00:29:44,918 --> 00:29:46,199
I am.

379
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,665
I am too.

380
00:29:52,675 --> 00:29:56,840
Let's set all embarrassment aside.
I'll be the MC, okay?

381
00:29:57,013 --> 00:29:58,722
Okay?

382
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:02,474
I'll take the lack of clapping
as consent.

383
00:30:03,353 --> 00:30:05,679
Rokko Toura...

384
00:30:05,855 --> 00:30:07,683
do you know anything

385
00:30:08,524 --> 00:30:10,233
about sexual fulfillment?

386
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:15,188
I do, but I --
You continue.

387
00:30:15,365 --> 00:30:19,198
Fine, I'll ignore Rokko Toura...

388
00:30:19,369 --> 00:30:21,742
and pan over
to Masao Matsuda.

389
00:30:21,913 --> 00:30:25,912
Masao Matsuda, are you
or are you not sexually satisfied?

390
00:30:26,084 --> 00:30:29,086
That's not the issue.
Everyone here is sexually satisfied.

391
00:30:29,212 --> 00:30:32,380
- Are you sexually satisfied?
- I'm having sex.

392
00:30:32,715 --> 00:30:34,424
And now, on to today's guest.

393
00:30:34,551 --> 00:30:36,544
Mr. Tadashi Yamazaki.

394
00:30:36,719 --> 00:30:39,508
Are you sexually satisfied or not?

395
00:30:41,224 --> 00:30:43,264
- Sex...
- Are you getting any?

396
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,396
Having sex? I sure am.

397
00:30:46,813 --> 00:30:50,977
In other words, sex is not --

398
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,725
It's not a duty, is it?
- It's --

399
00:30:54,362 --> 00:30:57,364
Do you consider sex a duty?
- No, I don't.

400
00:30:57,532 --> 00:31:00,487
Okay, let's say I tell you
that I love a woman.

401
00:31:00,618 --> 00:31:03,288
Why do you think I'd say
something so embarrassing?

402
00:31:03,288 --> 00:31:05,039
How should I know?

403
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,207
Rokko Toura has announced
that he loves a woman.

404
00:31:08,376 --> 00:31:10,204
I find that rather hard to believe.

405
00:31:10,378 --> 00:31:14,543
If I may be so bold
what is love exactly?

406
00:31:14,966 --> 00:31:16,960
- Well --
- Please answer.

407
00:31:17,135 --> 00:31:18,678
Let's ask Kei Sato.

408
00:31:21,055 --> 00:31:24,390
Love? Love isn't
something you talk about.

409
00:31:25,977 --> 00:31:30,474
Kei Sato
on TV you look as if you've been

410
00:31:30,607 --> 00:31:33,478
bleached out psychologically.

411
00:31:33,693 --> 00:31:35,817
What's that like?

412
00:31:37,071 --> 00:31:38,187
Shut up, boy!

413
00:31:38,323 --> 00:31:40,731
What about it?
- What about what?

414
00:31:41,659 --> 00:31:45,325
You're worse than a boy!

415
00:31:45,663 --> 00:31:47,624
I have my doubts.

416
00:31:47,624 --> 00:31:50,198
On TV,
instead of playing a character,

417
00:31:50,376 --> 00:31:53,544
you look to me like
you're simply being yourself.

418
00:31:53,671 --> 00:31:56,507
So when you appear as yourself,
as Kei Sato,

419
00:31:56,633 --> 00:31:58,875
I'm not sure what to make of it.

420
00:31:59,135 --> 00:32:02,505
- Why?
- It's just confusing somehow.

421
00:32:04,557 --> 00:32:08,390
- That's my intention.
- That's your intention?

422
00:32:08,603 --> 00:32:10,980
What kind of woman do I love?

423
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,606
That's an utterly trivial point.

424
00:32:12,732 --> 00:32:18,107
That's something you either
just understand or you don't.

425
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:21,780
One doesn't have to reveal
everything about one's sex life.

426
00:32:21,908 --> 00:32:25,076
- You're being difficult.
- I'm what?

427
00:32:25,411 --> 00:32:28,746
- Explain why you're being difficult.
- How am I doing that?

428
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:32,077
In various ways.

429
00:32:32,252 --> 00:32:34,126
You think I'm being difficult,

430
00:32:34,254 --> 00:32:36,294
but I don't think I am at all.

431
00:32:36,422 --> 00:32:37,372
Well --

432
00:32:38,174 --> 00:32:41,425
You're being ridiculous,
thinking that about me!

433
00:32:41,553 --> 00:32:44,720
Don't be absurd.
You're damn annoying.

434
00:32:44,889 --> 00:32:48,722
When pigs fly!
This is a waste of time.

435
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:53,189
So, Kei, if your partner
doesn't matter here,

436
00:32:53,356 --> 00:32:55,563
how is sex different
from masturbation?

437
00:32:55,817 --> 00:32:57,561
Let me put it this way:

438
00:32:57,694 --> 00:32:59,853
As a phenomenon,

439
00:33:00,029 --> 00:33:02,189
or physiologically,

440
00:33:02,323 --> 00:33:04,898
during the act of coitus,

441
00:33:05,034 --> 00:33:09,532
you fall into the illusion
of becoming one with your partner.

442
00:33:09,706 --> 00:33:13,918
But I think men and women
experience that differently.

443
00:33:14,168 --> 00:33:15,961
Nonsense.

444
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:18,081
- Why?
- I think it's nonsense.

445
00:33:18,214 --> 00:33:20,884
- Why?
- I'll explain.

446
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:22,795
- Please do.
- I'll answer.

447
00:33:22,927 --> 00:33:24,422
Answer, please!

448
00:33:24,554 --> 00:33:27,342
Yes, I'm getting to it.

449
00:33:27,515 --> 00:33:32,558
The question is
"What is sex?" generally speaking.

450
00:33:33,313 --> 00:33:35,023
You mean for me?

451
00:33:35,023 --> 00:33:39,816
I mean, I want to answer
the question "What is sex?"

452
00:33:40,403 --> 00:33:42,812
I'm thinking hard

453
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:46,362
about what to say.

454
00:33:46,534 --> 00:33:50,118
But since it's not something
I usually think about,

455
00:33:50,288 --> 00:33:53,243
I really have to think hard.

456
00:33:54,208 --> 00:33:57,246
For instance,

457
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:00,256
when I feel it's "sex time,"

458
00:34:00,423 --> 00:34:02,547
when I think
"just now sex time" --

459
00:34:06,262 --> 00:34:09,679
or her shoulder,
or neck, or tits --

460
00:34:09,807 --> 00:34:13,427
you usually don't see
the nipples --

461
00:34:13,603 --> 00:34:16,854
but even when I see
the upper part,

462
00:34:16,981 --> 00:34:19,651
I think and think about it.

463
00:34:19,817 --> 00:34:22,570
So are a woman's arms

464
00:34:22,737 --> 00:34:25,406
simply there to allure men?

465
00:34:25,573 --> 00:34:29,489
Are they just for embracing men?
No, they're not.

466
00:34:29,619 --> 00:34:34,615
Her arms are for washing cups,
washing this, cleaning that.

467
00:34:35,124 --> 00:34:38,162
Clearly they're there
for that as well.

468
00:34:38,336 --> 00:34:40,828
Simple example:
During the Olympics --

469
00:34:40,964 --> 00:34:45,093
Why is Toura explaining
to everyone how he and his woman

470
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,502
are getting so serious?

471
00:34:48,805 --> 00:34:50,597
My woman and I...

472
00:34:52,308 --> 00:34:54,136
are pretty deeply involved...

473
00:34:54,727 --> 00:35:00,103
but I doubt she's as hot for me
as I am for her.

474
00:35:01,401 --> 00:35:03,560
I even doubt my own feelings.

475
00:35:05,113 --> 00:35:09,942
Because I feel this uncertainty,
I want to go on living.

476
00:35:12,328 --> 00:35:16,161
If nothing's in doubt,
I feel no desire to go on living.

477
00:35:16,416 --> 00:35:21,328
When we talk about sex,
I want to talk about everything...

478
00:35:23,882 --> 00:35:26,338
about how best to live.

479
00:35:28,845 --> 00:35:30,126
That sums it up.

480
00:35:30,305 --> 00:35:34,635
I don't think
sexual liberation is possible.

481
00:35:34,809 --> 00:35:38,393
In the end,
it's up to each individual.

482
00:35:38,521 --> 00:35:42,686
It should be left at that.

483
00:35:42,901 --> 00:35:45,060
I find that much more beautiful.

484
00:35:45,236 --> 00:35:48,820
Things like that report
by Masters and Johnson,

485
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:53,949
all that information and statistics --
they mean nothing.

486
00:35:54,245 --> 00:35:55,657
So...

487
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,872
Okay... well...

488
00:36:04,047 --> 00:36:07,049
a man and a woman
sleep together,

489
00:36:07,217 --> 00:36:10,053
and there's a result.

490
00:36:10,178 --> 00:36:14,342
I'm not talking about
whether a child is born or not.

491
00:36:14,515 --> 00:36:16,059
I'm just saying...

492
00:36:18,895 --> 00:36:23,143
are they glad
they had sex or not?

493
00:36:23,274 --> 00:36:24,900
That's the point.

494
00:36:25,068 --> 00:36:27,145
You're basically saying
their enjoyment

495
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,812
depends on their partner's genitals.

496
00:36:29,989 --> 00:36:34,154
Earlier you were talking about
the Olympics and arms and whatnot.

497
00:36:34,452 --> 00:36:37,371
You're just talking
about parts and pieces.

498
00:36:38,081 --> 00:36:40,703
Whether her genitals
feel good or not --

499
00:36:40,917 --> 00:36:43,076
that's just something
she was born with.

500
00:36:44,212 --> 00:36:45,956
You're talking nonsense.

501
00:36:46,089 --> 00:36:48,415
Don't you appreciate
something that's well-made?

502
00:36:48,591 --> 00:36:51,593
That's irrelevant.
Whether they're good genitals or not,

503
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:55,848
good sex means making
the best of them, understand?

504
00:36:57,433 --> 00:37:02,809
Even if they're not the best,
even if they're awful...

505
00:37:03,773 --> 00:37:07,309
good sex means
making them tasty.

506
00:37:07,443 --> 00:37:10,778
Okay, then just what is sex?

507
00:37:11,489 --> 00:37:14,361
"Sex" should end with an S.

508
00:37:14,534 --> 00:37:16,492
It's got to be plural.

509
00:37:16,744 --> 00:37:18,703
That is, a man and a woman.

510
00:37:19,789 --> 00:37:23,658
It can't just be masturbation.

511
00:37:24,711 --> 00:37:28,128
<i>"Having another person watch
can also be enjoyable.</i>

512
00:37:28,298 --> 00:37:30,790
<i>MAYOR OF THE NIGHT
Then there was the 'kelp roll.'</i>

513
00:37:30,967 --> 00:37:34,170
<i>Explanation may be superfluous
but I offer it anyway.</i>

514
00:37:34,721 --> 00:37:37,557
<i>Until around January 20th,
geisha wear</i>

515
00:37:37,724 --> 00:37:41,805
<i>a long kimono decorated
with a thick, heavy sash.</i>

516
00:37:42,395 --> 00:37:46,014
<i>They usually remove
this sash after getting into bed,</i>

517
00:37:46,149 --> 00:37:50,100
<i>but in this case they leave it on --
thus becoming a 'kelp roll'--</i>

518
00:37:50,278 --> 00:37:54,656
<i>which is considered lucky if done
in the first week of January.</i>

519
00:37:54,991 --> 00:37:58,657
<i>When I heard that,
I thought it sounded like fun.</i>

520
00:37:58,786 --> 00:38:02,785
<i>So I agreed.
But that wasn't enough.</i>

521
00:38:03,291 --> 00:38:05,119
<i>So I made a suggestion:</i>

522
00:38:05,293 --> 00:38:08,081
<i>'I'll be the subject
for an experiment.</i>

523
00:38:08,213 --> 00:38:10,290
<i>Let's have everyone
hide and watch.'</i>

524
00:38:10,465 --> 00:38:12,505
<i>Everyone was sure to agree.</i>

525
00:38:12,675 --> 00:38:14,669
<i>So we arranged everything</i>

526
00:38:14,802 --> 00:38:17,591
<i>and called in a young geisha.</i>

527
00:38:17,722 --> 00:38:21,721
<i>The older geisha

had taken him to Tomorrow Books</i>

737
00:59:57,647 --> 00:59:59,308
<i>to see if he was an editor there.</i>

738
00:59:59,482 --> 01:00:03,066
<i>Others said he was taken
to Bei Xin Books</i>

739

<i>to confirm he was Rou Shi.</i>

740
01:00:05,488 --> 01:00:08,988
<i>Since he was handcuffed,
his case must have been serious.</i>

741

<i>Some said he might be
released on bail,</i>

742
01:00:12,912 --> 01:00:17,077

<i>Had the tin bowls reached him?</i>

750
01:00:36,853 --> 01:00:39,345

<i>Rou Shi and 23 others,</i>

752
01:00:41,858 --> 01:00:44,184

<i>'Used to the long,

773

We meet again.

779
01:03:41,394 --> 01:03:43,222
I think I've got the picture.

780
01:03:43,396 --> 01:03:46,267
I've never been averse
to love affairs myself,

781
01:03:46,399 --> 01:03:48,606
so I've put up
with you two this far,

782
01:03:48,776 --> 01:03:52,360
but let's bring
our little drama to an end now.

783
01:03:57,201 --> 01:03:58,483

Ms. Suzuki, you're acting strangely.
You should stop there.

789
01:04:56,093 --> 01:04:58,632
I've done a lot of wild things
in my time --

790
01:04:58,804 --> 01:05:00,715
well, a few --

791
01:05:00,848 --> 01:05:04,763
and I don't intend
to pursue you two any further.

792
01:05:04,936 --> 01:05:06,265
In baseball,

793
01:05:06,395 --> 01:05:09,397
if you take it easy
in the early innings,

794
01:05:09,565 --> 01:05:13,149
you'll find yourself
losing in the ninth.

795
01:05:34,924 --> 01:05:36,004
Please buy this girl.

796
01:05:46,102 --> 01:05:48,345
That's enough. I get it.

797
01:06:14,213 --> 01:06:15,839
Please buy her.

798
01:06:16,716 --> 01:06:18,045
That's right.

799
01:06:18,217 --> 01:06:19,677
I'm a whore.

800
01:06:20,177 --> 01:06:21,673
A prostitute.

801
01:06:21,971 --> 01:06:23,556
A good-time girl.

802
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:25,224
I was gang-raped.

803
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:50,572
Your bodies make a nice composition,
like a swastika,

804
01:06:50,708 --> 01:06:52,666
but I feel bad for the books.

805
01:06:52,835 --> 01:06:54,710
I am those books.

806
01:06:58,716 --> 01:07:00,342
Please buy her.

807
01:07:07,016 --> 01:07:09,060
The game is over.

808
01:07:09,060 --> 01:07:14,351
I knew from the start you were
only pretending to be my employee.

809
01:07:31,123 --> 01:07:33,283
Umeko Suzuki

THERE ARE ODIOUS
THINGS IN THE WORLD

816
01:08:33,185 --> 01:08:35,678
THE NIGHT DEEPENS AGAIN

817
01:08:35,855 --> 01:08:39,189

<i>Everybody waiting,
doing nothing but waiting,</i>

821
01:08:48,367 --> 01:08:49,697
<i>waiting to see the show:</i>

01:08:49,869 --> 01:08:52,028
<i>Juro Kara's</i> Shosetsu Yui.

823
01:08:52,246 --> 01:08:54,572
<i>Idiots. They could
perform it themselves.</i>

824
01:08:54,749 --> 01:08:56,742
<i>"This is the office
at the Hanazono shrine.</i>

825
01:08:56,918 --> 01:08:58,876
<i>Tonight's performance

826
01:08:59,045 --> 01:09:00,955
<i>Everybody please break it up."</i>

827
01:09:01,088 --> 01:09:04,090
<i>But Umeko and I can't break up.</i>

828
01:09:04,216 --> 01:09:07,337
<i>I have 30,000 yen. They say everyone
leaves you when you're broke.</i>

829
01:09:07,511 --> 01:09:09,304
<i>I took Umeko's money
for when I want to leave.</i>

830
01:09:09,430 --> 01:09:12,598
<i>We're not beggars.
We're really thieves.</i>

831
01:09:12,725 --> 01:09:15,513
<i>Mr. Tanabe
couldn't understand that.</i>

832
01:09:15,686 --> 01:09:18,059
<i>That's why he didn’t join us.</i>

833
01:09:18,689 --> 01:09:22,688
<i>I think Umeko wanted
to steal Mr. Tanabe's manhood,</i>

834
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:25,648
<i>and I wanted
to steal sex from Umeko.</i>

835
01:09:26,072 --> 01:09:27,900
<i>He wanted no part of it.</i>

836
01:09:28,032 --> 01:09:30,701
<i>He taught us many things,</i>

837
01:09:30,701 --> 01:09:33,028
<i>but he might as well
have taught us nothing at all.</i>

838
01:09:33,204 --> 01:09:37,285
<i>Normally we'd split the 30,000
so I could buy a girl for 15,000</i>

839
01:09:37,416 --> 01:09:39,659
<i>and Umeko could buy a boy,</i>

840
01:09:39,835 --> 01:09:41,829
<i>and we could break up.</i>

841
01:09:42,004 --> 01:09:45,955
<i>But rather than buy a girl,
I wanted to become one,</i>

842
01:09:46,092 --> 01:09:48,928
<i>though I don't know
if Umeko wants to be a boy...</i>

843
01:09:55,268 --> 01:09:57,345
May I make an offering
to the spirits?

844
01:10:01,941 --> 01:10:03,317
Why?

845
01:10:03,609 --> 01:10:06,066
Did you kill someone?
- Not yet.

846
01:10:15,121 --> 01:10:18,870
I'd take one of these
and whip it out.

847
01:10:25,047 --> 01:10:28,215
Or wear a woman's costume.
- Are you an actor?

848
01:10:28,384 --> 01:10:31,920
Watching plays, acting in them --
neither is any fun.

849
01:10:32,346 --> 01:10:35,016
Then why'd you act
like a bookstore clerk?

850
01:10:37,977 --> 01:10:41,145
Perfect fit, huh?
- It's obscene.

851
01:10:41,314 --> 01:10:43,307
What are you looking to do?

852
01:10:44,609 --> 01:10:47,101
I want to try being someone else.

853
01:10:47,278 --> 01:10:49,437
- You mean it?
- Yes.

854
01:10:50,489 --> 01:10:53,064
Then you can be Shosetsu Yui.

855
01:10:56,203 --> 01:10:57,948
Don't do it.

856
01:10:59,248 --> 01:11:00,708
There's something wrong with him.

857
01:11:01,417 --> 01:11:03,245
It's all lies.

858
01:11:03,836 --> 01:11:05,830
He's too spineless
to play Shosetsu Yui.

859
01:11:06,005 --> 01:11:09,292
- Oddballs make better actors.
- But he's a rank amateur --

860
01:11:09,467 --> 01:11:12,422
I can see it in his eyes:
the eyes of a thief.

861
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:19,341
In 80 years of modern Japanese drama
no thief ever became an actor.

862
01:11:19,518 --> 01:11:24,228
We can use that
as a selling point on the marquee.

863
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,727
The word "kabuki" comes from

864
01:11:28,903 --> 01:11:32,154
means "to act boldly
and dramatically."

865
01:11:32,698 --> 01:11:36,033
The actors weren't the shogun's
retainers but social outcasts

866
01:11:36,202 --> 01:11:39,370
chased into the riverbeds.
That's what made them great.

867
01:11:39,872 --> 01:11:44,037
But I won't show you the trapdoor
that leads to the riverbed, you hear?

868
01:11:44,877 --> 01:11:47,500
You have to find your own.

869
01:11:47,838 --> 01:11:49,417
If you don't find it,

870
01:11:50,341 --> 01:11:52,050
and people start praising you

871
01:11:52,218 --> 01:11:53,547
with terms like
"underground" and "psychedelic,"

872
01:11:53,928 --> 01:11:57,380
you'll start feeling you've made it
before you really have.

873
01:12:01,394 --> 01:12:04,977
<i>Head for sale!</i>

874
01:12:05,815 --> 01:12:09,683
Head for sale!

875
01:13:22,391 --> 01:13:24,100
Who are you?

876
01:13:24,602 --> 01:13:26,263
Shosetsu Yui!

877
01:13:26,562 --> 01:13:29,434
Head for sale!

878
01:13:30,191 --> 01:13:31,734
Your head!

879
01:13:31,984 --> 01:13:35,187
- Give it here!
- Get out, you crazy bitch!

880
01:13:35,404 --> 01:13:37,197
Get out.

881
01:13:39,575 --> 01:13:41,699
What a strange face!

882
01:13:49,835 --> 01:13:51,414
"I'm really getting it tonight."

883
01:13:56,509 --> 01:13:58,337
Why are you helping him?

884
01:13:58,636 --> 01:14:01,424
Who are you?
Tell me your name.

885
01:14:02,431 --> 01:14:03,428
Shosetsu Yui.

886
01:14:03,599 --> 01:14:05,392
"It's not just the town that's crazy!"

887
01:14:05,476 --> 01:14:07,802
That's right.
It's you and him and everyone.

888
01:14:11,774 --> 01:14:13,150
I know you.

889
01:14:13,484 --> 01:14:16,687
You ran away, didn't you?
Coward!

890
01:14:16,862 --> 01:14:19,070
You're the one
who killed your comrades.

891
01:14:19,198 --> 01:14:22,236
You watched
as you had them killed.

892
01:14:22,410 --> 01:14:23,905
"You're the one
who had your comrades killed!"

893
01:14:24,036 --> 01:14:25,911
"Don't confuse me
with someone else, hag!"

894
01:14:27,456 --> 01:14:29,450
"Don't confuse me
with someone else, hag!"

895
01:14:32,878 --> 01:14:36,046
Listen to the crow caw
as it flies away!

896
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:40,634
Call out his name once more!

897
01:14:41,429 --> 01:14:43,588
Once more! All together!

898
01:14:43,723 --> 01:14:44,922
Caw! Caw!

899
01:14:45,308 --> 01:14:46,507
Caw!

900
01:14:46,767 --> 01:14:49,094
"You dare call me a caw?"

901
01:14:49,437 --> 01:14:51,763
- You dare call me a caw?
- What?

902
01:14:53,858 --> 01:14:55,686
Maruboshi, stand up!

903
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:00,646
Wait a minute.

904
01:15:01,073 --> 01:15:03,067
Let me hear your name again.

905
01:15:05,036 --> 01:15:07,610
What did you say your name was?

906
01:15:08,581 --> 01:15:10,658
Shosetsu Yui.

907
01:15:12,710 --> 01:15:15,463
Yui: "Can anything compare with"
Shosetsu: "Pure snow"

908
01:15:16,756 --> 01:15:19,592
That voice, those teeth,

909
01:15:19,759 --> 01:15:23,425
those big ears,
that strong odor,

910
01:15:23,554 --> 01:15:26,223
that sash, that expression,
those gestures,

911
01:15:26,349 --> 01:15:31,177
that way of adjusting his loincloth
as he walks without using his hands.

912
01:15:33,564 --> 01:15:36,056
Shosetsu was raised
by me, Yozakura.

913
01:15:36,233 --> 01:15:40,149
Impostor!
You're not Shosetsu Yui.

914
01:15:40,279 --> 01:15:41,359
"That's right!"

915
01:15:41,572 --> 01:15:43,780
"Then who do you say
I am, hag?"

916
01:15:44,075 --> 01:15:45,903
Who do you say he is?

917
01:15:50,122 --> 01:15:51,950
Stop!

918
01:15:56,712 --> 01:15:57,709
Get out of the way!

919
01:16:11,143 --> 01:16:13,220
Impostor!
Shameless impostor!

920
01:16:13,354 --> 01:16:16,771
If you were Shosetsu,
I'd recognize you.

921
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:21,521
You senile old streetwalker!

922
01:16:22,029 --> 01:16:24,984
I'll strike your vital points!

923
01:16:25,366 --> 01:16:27,110
What the hell are you doing?

924
01:16:27,493 --> 01:16:29,036
A blow to your vital point!

925
01:16:33,332 --> 01:16:39,169
Pure snow... can anything compare?

926
01:16:43,342 --> 01:16:45,003
Stay away from her!

927
01:17:12,048 --> 01:17:16,659
JOKYO GEKIJO
SPIRIT PERFORMANCE

928
01:17:16,834 --> 01:17:18,662
AUDIENCE:

929
01:17:18,794 --> 01:17:21,286
1,000 GIRLS

930
01:17:21,464 --> 01:17:23,292
AUDIENCE:

931
01:17:23,466 --> 01:17:26,669
10,000 POLICEMEN

932
01:17:27,803 --> 01:17:31,968
"A man should never leave
his promises in a woman's hands.

933
01:17:33,893 --> 01:17:37,179
A man should only
pass over a woman.

934
01:17:38,648 --> 01:17:41,436
A man should only
pass over a woman."

935
01:17:42,610 --> 01:17:44,354
"Hurry up and pass over."

936
01:17:49,992 --> 01:17:53,243
"This is also true
of that immense woman, the nation.

937
01:17:53,537 --> 01:17:55,448
Man must not serve woman.

938
01:17:56,457 --> 01:17:58,700
What is a woman?"
- I am!

939
01:18:01,504 --> 01:18:04,838
"Chuya, women are a pitfall.

940
01:18:05,883 --> 01:18:08,043
Women do not wait for men."

941
01:18:11,806 --> 01:18:15,258
"Chuya, men are a pitfall!

942
01:18:15,810 --> 01:18:17,850
Men do not wait for women."

943
01:18:21,274 --> 01:18:24,477
"Women, Chuya,
are waiting below

944
01:18:24,819 --> 01:18:26,978
at your feet...

945
01:18:28,114 --> 01:18:30,688
to swallow you up
like an octopus trap.

946
01:18:31,284 --> 01:18:33,443
They just want you.

947
01:18:35,246 --> 01:18:38,912
They're like octopus traps
that swallow men's dreams.

948
01:18:40,418 --> 01:18:42,707
Chuya, there are no women.

949
01:18:57,143 --> 01:18:58,638
Believe me,

950
01:18:58,811 --> 01:19:02,146
there's no such thing
as a woman in this world!"

951
01:19:03,816 --> 01:19:05,976
- Hey!
- I'm going to clean up.

952
01:19:07,695 --> 01:19:08,811
Wait.

953
01:19:08,988 --> 01:19:11,147
Excuse us.

954
01:19:12,033 --> 01:19:13,907
Hold on.
What are you doing?

955
01:19:19,498 --> 01:19:21,622
I said wait a second!

956
01:19:25,004 --> 01:19:26,665
What costume do I wear next?

957
01:19:26,839 --> 01:19:29,508
Believe me,
there are no women.

958
01:19:29,926 --> 01:19:32,797
Neither what you nor I imagine
as a woman exists.

959
01:19:32,970 --> 01:19:34,300
Water sprite!

960
01:19:34,430 --> 01:19:36,424
Pay no attention to her.

961
01:19:36,641 --> 01:19:39,133
All we need do is close our eyes

962
01:19:39,268 --> 01:19:41,760
and pass over her like a breeze.

963
01:19:41,896 --> 01:19:45,681
But after all,
Japan is an island nation.

964
01:19:45,858 --> 01:19:48,315
She keeps her legs crossed
just like a woman

965
01:19:48,444 --> 01:19:50,319
for fear of attack
from the outside.

966
01:19:50,488 --> 01:19:53,490
Europe seems so much better.

967
01:19:53,658 --> 01:19:56,576
Holland, Italy, Germany,
Afghanistan --

968
01:19:56,702 --> 01:20:00,831
they're all just whorehouses
wearing goddesses' crowns.

969
01:20:01,624 --> 01:20:04,958
In the West,
ten women wait for one man.

970
01:20:05,086 --> 01:20:09,749
But in this country,
one woman toys with ten men.

971
01:20:12,718 --> 01:20:15,257
You're not Shosetsu anymore.
Let's go.

972
01:20:16,222 --> 01:20:19,307
- Hasn't it stopped yet?
- It's still dribbling out.

973
01:20:19,892 --> 01:20:22,680
Chuya, believe that
there is no woman.

974
01:20:23,062 --> 01:20:25,636
Powerful men have always
ruled this country,

975
01:20:25,773 --> 01:20:29,273
but in the end,
the country raped all her rulers.

976
01:20:29,652 --> 01:20:33,318
Men today must raise themselves
above the men of the past.

977
01:20:33,573 --> 01:20:36,528
No, pay no attention to her.

978
01:20:39,704 --> 01:20:41,282
Shosetsu...

979
01:20:42,081 --> 01:20:45,332
stop whining like a mistress's son!
- Damn it!

980
01:20:48,129 --> 01:20:50,835
After all, here we have
a fine woman named Ogin.

981
01:20:51,465 --> 01:20:54,004
With your arbitrary theories
about women,

982
01:20:54,093 --> 01:20:57,095
Ogin won't know
what to do with herself.

983
01:20:57,930 --> 01:21:02,593
Your ideas are just those
of a bachelor's utopia.

984
01:21:02,768 --> 01:21:04,264
Weak!

985
01:21:04,437 --> 01:21:08,566
You're just an undernourished
king of weak ideas.

986
01:21:08,691 --> 01:21:11,265
<i>Oh, poor thing!</i>

987
01:21:11,611 --> 01:21:14,103
<i>Oh, poor thing!</i>

988
01:21:14,238 --> 01:21:16,232
<i>Since my family was poor</i>

989
01:21:16,866 --> 01:21:19,405
<i>I went to work in an oil shop
when I was little</i>

990
01:21:20,286 --> 01:21:22,992
<i>They let me out once a year</i>

991
01:21:23,331 --> 01:21:26,000
<i>To go to the winter
cherry market fair</i>

992
01:21:27,084 --> 01:21:33,171
<i>The boss's wife
was a nasty woman</i>

993
01:21:34,050 --> 01:21:37,716
<i>Who suspected something
between me and her husband</i>

994
01:21:37,845 --> 01:21:41,345
<i>I trembled in fear,
year after year</i>

995
01:21:42,308 --> 01:21:45,642
<i>She shot sharp glances at me
as I swept or served rice</i>

996
01:21:45,811 --> 01:21:48,979
<i>And of course
when I looked at the boss</i>

997
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:53,190
<i>She paid me so much attention
that the boss started too as well</i>

998
01:21:53,486 --> 01:21:55,526
<i>One night, as I returned home
from the baths</i>

999
01:21:55,655 --> 01:21:58,194
<i>He beckoned me
from behind a trashcan</i>

1000
01:21:58,658 --> 01:22:01,280
<i>"Ogin, come here
and show me your ass"</i>

1001
01:22:01,452 --> 01:22:03,446
<i>I didn’t like him,
but I let him have his way</i>

1002
01:22:03,579 --> 01:22:06,249
<i>It didn't hurt
but I pretended it did</i>

1003
01:22:06,832 --> 01:22:08,826
<i>In due course
his wife found out</i>

1004
01:22:09,210 --> 01:22:11,369
<i>One night I wrapped
my things in a bundle</i>

1005
01:22:11,504 --> 01:22:14,707
<i>And went to work in a bicycle shop --
- Poor thing!</i>

1006
01:22:14,882 --> 01:22:17,208
<i>The boss this time had palsy</i>

1007
01:22:17,635 --> 01:22:20,423
<i>No worries from him</i>

1008
01:22:21,264 --> 01:22:25,594
<i>But his idiot son Yochan</i>

1009
01:22:26,519 --> 01:22:29,889
<i>Came crawling
under my covers every night</i>

1010
01:22:30,022 --> 01:22:33,190
"Yochan, why do you bring
your freezing feet into my bed?"

1011
01:22:33,359 --> 01:22:35,234
No matter
how many times I refused,

1012
01:22:35,361 --> 01:22:37,236
Yochan would
burst out laughing and say,

1013
01:22:37,405 --> 01:22:39,398
"Ogin, let me suck
your 'winter cherries.'

1014
01:22:39,532 --> 01:22:41,572
Where did you pick them?

1015
01:22:41,742 --> 01:22:46,073
I'd like to buy some
an suck them dry."

1016
01:22:46,247 --> 01:22:49,996
"Don't be silly! Like I'd ever be
the plaything of an idiot like you!"

1017
01:22:51,085 --> 01:22:54,870
The shoji whooshed open,
and who was there but the old boss.

1018
01:22:55,423 --> 01:22:58,045
With a pump in one hand,
he screams,

1019
01:22:58,217 --> 01:23:00,341
"Where's the flat tire?"

1020
01:23:00,886 --> 01:23:04,932
He grabs my breast and tries to blow
air into it, cheeks bellowing.

1021
01:23:05,308 --> 01:23:07,218
"That's no inner tube!"

1022
01:23:07,393 --> 01:23:11,439
Yet he keeps puffing furiously.

1023
01:23:11,564 --> 01:23:17,069
Stupid Yochan and his pathetic dad
came to blows over whether...

1024
01:23:17,236 --> 01:23:18,815
How awful it must have been!

1025
01:23:18,946 --> 01:23:23,241
...whether it was a winter cherry
or a flat tire. What a fight!

1026
01:23:24,410 --> 01:23:27,079
<i>Without a word</i>

1027
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:32,993
<i>I fled into the night</i>

1028
01:23:34,420 --> 01:23:36,746
<i>And wandered down the road</i>

1029
01:23:36,923 --> 01:23:39,759
<i>Holding my sandals in one hand</i>

1030
01:23:40,551 --> 01:23:44,846
<i>Trudging along,
where shall I go?</i>

1031
01:23:47,266 --> 01:23:51,347
<i>I asked the stars in vain</i>

1032
01:23:52,730 --> 01:23:55,056
<i>As the night quietly deepened</i>

1033
01:23:55,191 --> 01:23:57,765
<i>The quiet Edo night</i>

1034
01:23:58,778 --> 01:24:01,186
<i>I got soaked</i>

1035
01:24:01,656 --> 01:24:04,195
<i>In the evening dew</i>

1036
01:24:05,952 --> 01:24:09,535
<i>It was then that I learned</i>

1037
01:24:10,081 --> 01:24:13,581
<i>With a delighted laugh
of recognition</i>

1038
01:24:15,378 --> 01:24:20,041
<i>Just how sad</i>

1039
01:24:20,383 --> 01:24:24,796
<i>A woman's fate can be</i>

1040
01:24:26,055 --> 01:24:27,219
Woof woof!

1041
01:24:48,786 --> 01:24:50,578
What are you doing?

1042
01:24:56,043 --> 01:24:57,704
Shall we steal it?

DIARY OF A SHINJUKU THIEF

1044
01:25:01,340 --> 01:25:03,667
- It's all your fault!
- I'm sorry!

1045
01:25:03,884 --> 01:25:05,166
Go find it!

1046
01:25:18,274 --> 01:25:21,442
Hanbei, call my name.

1047
01:25:23,279 --> 01:25:26,150
Didn't I tell you
to tell me who I am

1048
01:25:26,866 --> 01:25:31,030
whenever I cut down somebody
standing in my way?

1049
01:25:35,708 --> 01:25:38,377
You tell me to take off this mask.

1050
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:43,339
My hands are too slippery
with blood!

1051
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:51,137
You tell me to show
my face behind the mask.

1052
01:25:52,850 --> 01:25:54,393
My hands slip.

1053
01:25:55,645 --> 01:26:00,308
I didn't realize
blood was this oily.

1054
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:06,195
Head for sale!

1055
01:26:06,364 --> 01:26:07,527
That head is sold!

1056
01:26:10,743 --> 01:26:12,119
You want that head?

1057
01:26:13,079 --> 01:26:14,325
Or this one?

1058
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,412
Which will it be?

1059
01:26:50,157 --> 01:26:51,238
I...

1060
01:26:57,873 --> 01:27:00,081
I'll have this head!

1061
01:27:04,338 --> 01:27:05,537
No!

1062
01:27:06,299 --> 01:27:09,254
What big, fluffy snowflakes!

1063
01:27:20,605 --> 01:27:23,144
I am Shosetsu Yui.

1064
01:27:33,075 --> 01:27:35,484
Please return my husband's head.

1065
01:27:47,423 --> 01:27:50,758
Juro Kara, it's my fault
it was stolen.

1066
01:27:51,594 --> 01:27:52,674
So don't stop me.

DIARY OF A SHINJUKU THIEF

1068
01:29:39,118 --> 01:29:41,112
What's this?
Where'd you get that scar?

1069
01:29:50,671 --> 01:29:54,540
This? I was about 18.

1070
01:29:55,134 --> 01:29:57,626
<i>I was walking around Shinjuku</i>

1071
01:29:58,137 --> 01:30:02,966
<i>when a boy of about 14</i>

1072
01:30:03,142 --> 01:30:05,385
<i>started following me.</i>

1073
01:30:05,561 --> 01:30:08,100
<i>I didn't realize
he was following me.</i>

1074
01:30:08,272 --> 01:30:12,734
<i>I just kept on walking,</i>

1075
01:30:13,694 --> 01:30:15,439
<i>and he suddenly ran towards me</i>

1076
01:30:15,613 --> 01:30:18,105
<i>He was probably disturbed.</i>

1077
01:30:18,616 --> 01:30:23,991
<i>He stabbed me and then ran off.</i>

1078
01:30:24,163 --> 01:30:27,284
<i>What did he stab you with?
Did he attack from behind?</i>

1079
01:30:27,416 --> 01:30:29,659
<i>Yes. It seems
it was a random attack.</i>

1080
01:30:30,336 --> 01:30:34,999
<i>But he quickly ran off,</i>

1081
01:30:35,216 --> 01:30:37,174
<i>so I couldn't tell.</i>

1082
01:30:37,343 --> 01:30:41,591
<i>Apparently he stabbed
two or three other girls,</i>

1083
01:30:41,722 --> 01:30:44,131
<i>and he was caught
soon thereafter.</i>

1084
01:30:44,308 --> 01:30:46,302
<i>I later asked the police.</i>

1085
01:30:48,604 --> 01:30:51,772
<i>It seems he was an American.</i>

1086
01:30:53,109 --> 01:30:56,194
<i>Did you realize right away
you'd been stabbed?</i>

1087
01:30:56,362 --> 01:31:00,361
<i>Only when I started bleeding.</i>

1088
01:31:01,033 --> 01:31:06,195
<i>But since he was an American,</i>

1089
01:31:06,372 --> 01:31:09,374
<i>alone in Japan without his parents,</i>

1090
01:31:09,542 --> 01:31:12,544
<i>I think he just kind of cracked</i>

1091
01:31:12,795 --> 01:31:17,956
<i>for all sorts of reasons,
and that's why he did it.</i>

1092
01:31:18,134 --> 01:31:22,179
<i>So I felt sorry for him
and didn't blame him.</i>

1093
01:31:24,724 --> 01:31:32,222
<i>But I do feel something like rage
toward nothing in particular.</i>

1094
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:35,358
<i>After that...</i>

1095
01:31:35,526 --> 01:31:40,355
<i>did you perhaps,
because of what had happened,</i>

1096
01:31:40,489 --> 01:31:44,073
<i>develop a phobia of men?</i>

1097
01:31:44,577 --> 01:31:47,662
<i>I don't think that had
anything to do with it.</i>

1098
01:31:48,414 --> 01:31:51,914
<i>So it has no connection
with sex?</i>

1099
01:31:52,084 --> 01:31:55,170
<i>No, there's no connection like that.</i>

1100
01:31:56,213 --> 01:31:59,465
<i>But actually...</i>

1101
01:31:59,592 --> 01:32:02,547
<i>I was afraid of men
for about a month.</i>

1102
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:06,719
<i>So you don't think that that scar
was also a wound to your heart?</i>

1103
01:32:07,767 --> 01:32:12,311
<i>Well, it did have
some effect on me.</i>

1104
01:32:12,438 --> 01:32:14,182
<i>Not a good one, I imagine.</i>

1105
01:32:14,523 --> 01:32:18,190
<i>Not a good effect,
but it was a singular event,</i>

1106
01:32:18,319 --> 01:32:22,234
<i>so in terms of
its place in my life,</i>

1107
01:32:23,282 --> 01:32:26,948
<i>I think getting stabbed
was a big deal.</i>

1108
01:32:27,119 --> 01:32:32,032
<i>Well, in the case --
how should I put it? --</i>

1109
01:32:34,126 --> 01:32:36,167
<i>Maybe you should
treasure that scar.</i>

1110
01:32:36,295 --> 01:32:38,870
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

1111
01:34:21,134 --> 01:34:24,743
Cops, go home!
