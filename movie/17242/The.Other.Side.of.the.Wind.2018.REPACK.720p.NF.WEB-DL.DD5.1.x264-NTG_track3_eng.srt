00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,166
Life was never like this
in Hicksville, huh, Julie?

154
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,416
-[Rich] Hicksville?
-Yeah, that little town you were born in.

155
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,750
I remember, Polack extraction.

156
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,458
Richeviski, huh?

157
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,875
You certainly seem to know quite a lot
about me, Mr. Costello.

158
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:39,375
Call me Matt.

159
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:43,208
-Oh, Matt here, he knows about everybody.
-[Matt] Keep it quiet.

160
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:44,583
He's on that committee,

161
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:47,458
the one that decides
if you're an American.

162
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:51,000
Maybe you didn't know
that these people are still in business.

163
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,291
You mean
that Mr. Hannaford's investigating me?

164
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,333
We're still in business, huh?

165
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,708
So what am I gonna see,
everything he's shot up until now?

166
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,625
Well, the first couple of reels, Max.

167
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:05,166
The last part's already at the ranch.

168
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,458
Zarah's giving him this party.

169
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,916
She's invited all these movie freaks.

170
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,916
We'll see the rest of the stuff
when we get out there.

171
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,375
Zarah's expecting you, Max.

172
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,500
So is Jake.

173
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,833
I was expecting him here.

174
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,750
Fine. Rolling. Hello, hello, hello...
Okay, I'm ready to go.

175
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,750
Just go right ahead and talk,
Mr. Hannaford.

176
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,708
-Don't mind us.
-[Pister] I'll go first.

177
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,833
Mr. Hannaford, is the camera eye
a reflection of reality?

178
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:38,791
Or is reality a reflection
of the camera eye?

179
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,166
Or is the camera merely a phallus?

180
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,166
-I want a drink.
-You heard him. Let's get it out here!

[filmmaker 4] We ought to start
with a broader spectrum. -Here.
-Don't you agree, Otterlake?

182
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,958
[filmmaker 5] True,
the interview is for everybody,

183
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,375
not just us.

184
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,916
[Pister] But today,
there's a special dispensation.

185
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,208
[filmmaker 6] Mr. Hannaford,
could you please slow down?

186
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:56,875
Otherwise, I'm gonna fall off the car.

187
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,416
-[shouts] Mr. Hannaford!

00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:02,166
-[Max] Dale something.
-John Dale, Max.

189
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,958
He-- He's the kid on the motorcycle.

190
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,083
-Look.
-[tires squeal]

191
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,833
According to Jake, the box likes him.

192
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,833
-Box?
-The old magic box.

193
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,875
If the camera doesn't like an actor,

194
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,375
it just stares at him.

195
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,166
Well, that's what Jake says.

196
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,875
And if the actor doesn't like
the old magic director?

197
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,125
[sighs] Yeah.

198
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,583
[Max] Is it true
Dale walked off the movie?

199
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,791
Well...

200
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,625
[stutters] He'll come back.

201
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:47,541
[car door closes]

202
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,625
And if he doesn't come back,
how will you finish it?

203
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:55,666
[Matt] Come on, Zimmie, Jake's fine.
He's just like he always was.

204
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,541
You know how he is sometimes.

205
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:02,291
He's... turning sour, Matt.
He's going bad.

206
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:06,250
-Oh, put a can on it, will you?
-[Zimmer] I'm a makeup man, an expert.

207
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:09,791
All my life, I've been sticking my nose

208
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,083
into other people's wrinkles.

209
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,708
I know the little signs.

210
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,916
It's something you can almost... smell.

211
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,000
[chuckling] That's what the gypsies say.

212
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:23,916
Gypsies?

213
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,041
Nine months, we practically lived
with them.

Right there on her.

Hey, hey.
Can you look over here? That's it...

219
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,208
-[Max] She's an Indian?
-A red, red Indian.

In the story.

221
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,833
You-- You'll meet her at the party, Max. [projector whirring]

222
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,208
How does the box feel about her?

223
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:06,708
To assess, Mr. Hannaford,
just how fully that theme in your work

224
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,416
may be a reflection
of your father's suicide--

225
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,958
The suicide can wait.

226
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,875
We ought to start
with a broader spectrum.

227
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:13,291
Don't you agree, Otterlake?

228
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,916
[imitating James Cagney]
Hannaford began his career...

229
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,833
as a propman...
for the ol' cliffhangers.

230
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,000
You were a property man?

I'm telling your life story.

235
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,416
This was in Hollywood?

236
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,750
Of course it was Hollywood.

237
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:34,875
He, uh...

238
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,583
He shared a-- a bungalow
with his first leading man, you know?

239
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,916
I even know his name. Frank Fryer.
How about that, Skipper?

240
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,125
And I'm the only one
not doing a book about you.

241
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,958
My book on Hannaford has been canceled.

242

-[Pister] Canceled?
-Indefinitely.

243
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,041
The first five chapters

244
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:57,125
took the two of us
three and a half years to-- to do.

I finally-- I had
to start directing myself so I could eat.

[Jake] The rest is history.

247

And now, I suppose you're too busy.

248

No. Well, we both are.
Take it from me, fellas...

he just purely hates being interviewed.

Shh! Um...
Action pictures. Plenty of action.

275

Jake and Frank used to strip to the waist,

Yes, the latest of all those actors

or, uh, way back with the ancestors?

00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:05,250
-<i>Glen Garvey...</i>
-[Jake] <i>I happened to notice them.</i>

306
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,333
Just listen.

307
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,916
[Jake] <i>But Dale, I found.</i> <i>Literally.</i>

308
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,833
<i>Fished him out of the sea.</i>
<i>Yeah, that's what you'd call a discovery.</i>

309
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,000
Do you get it?

310
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,750
He saved the cat's life.

311
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:19,791
[filmmaker 2] So, the boy's indebted
to him, even for that.

312
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,708
Can you imagine
a relationship more all-consuming...

313
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,166
between master and slave?

314
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:29,625
[Jake] <i>Dale was flopping around</i>
<i>like something you'd bring up in a net.</i>

315
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:30,791
<i>We did what we could.</i>

316
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,958
<i>Kept him on the yacht,</i>
<i>signed him on as a deckhand,</i>

317
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:35,208
<i>and made a sailor out of him, or tried to.</i>

318
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:36,791
<i>Sure, I rescued him.</i>

319
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,958
<i>And I've been rescuing him ever since.</i>

320
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:42,708
Look what he did with the others.
Glen Garvey, Courtney Saxon...

321
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:46,250
Courtney? He was selling vacuum cleaners
when Jake discovered him.

322
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:49,208
And as for Hannaford hisself--

323
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:50,125
What about him?

324
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:55,000
-Branch Sutter, he was a dishwasher.
-It could be he's wrong this time.

325
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:55,916
Who says so?

326
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,375
Zimmer says so. Ha!

327
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:00,416
I don't know what I think of this one.

328
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:01,416
[man 2] Who does?

329
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,291
-[exhales]
-[Pister] Jack Simon?

330
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,000
See that cop back there?

331
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:07,166
[shivering]

332
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,666
Uh... you guys are overloaded.

333
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:10,916
Thanks, Jack.

334
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:14,166
-Somebody's gonna have to go.
-[engine roars]

335
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,500
-[filmmaker 5] Pister, you're it.
-[Pister] Come on.

336
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:20,583
-Can he ride with you, Jack?
-Uh, I haven't got the insurance.

337
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:23,541
See you at the party.

338
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Thanks, Jack.

339
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,791
[filmmaker 5]
Good luck getting to the party, Pister!

340
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,208
[jazz music playing]

341
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,166
[Max] What happens here?

342
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,708
I'm not really sure, Max.

343
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,000
Uh, maybe-- maybe it's here
she leaves the-- the...

344
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:48,916
the bomb.

345
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,791
[brakes squeal]

346
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,583
Having fun, Mr. Pister?

347
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:09,416
The people in that last car
were kind of... awful.

348
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,875
Mr. Hannaford's car?

349
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:11,875
They threw me out.

350
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:16,333
And then I-- I tried-- I got a ride
with a bunch of video freaks.

351
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,291
But they ran out of gas,
or needed a fix or something.

352
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:23,083
-[toys squeaking]
-[Max] So, what are the toys about?

353
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:26,000
Well, be-- before this,
she'll be pretending

354
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,708
to look in the window at 'em.

355
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,166
That is, when we get around
to shooting it.

356
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:37,375
-[Max] She's some kind of crook?
-[Billy] Well, some kind of radical.

357
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:40,458
[stammering] Anyway, there's--
there's some more shops there,

358
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:43,708
and then, the boy thinks
she's been looking at these dolls.

359
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:47,833
[Max] Which doll?

360
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,916
Well, the one she...

361
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,000
he thinks she was looking at.

362
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,083
So...

363
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:57,041
well, he goes in and buys it for her.

364
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:59,166
May I see that, please?

365
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,708
-Jake wrote that?
-It's transcribed from tapes, I guess,

366
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,125
but it hasn't been typed.

367
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,375
"The hippies and the beatnicks.

368
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:10,166
The bums. Call them what you want to.

369
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:15,708
They slouch and slack around the floor
because they like it down there.

370
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,625
Talk about the return to the womb,

371
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:21,208
what about the return to the cave?

372
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:22,875
[laughs and slurps]

373
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,833
Junk. Junk is how you get there.

for the cool dreams, kid.
And the cool, dim, anonymous gang shag.

377
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,583
The mutual jack-off."

378
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,375
[laughing]
That's sure telling it like it is, huh?

379
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,833
[projector whirring]

380
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:51,666
What's in the package?

381
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:54,458
Uh, the package.
You-- You mean, what she's got in her bag?

382
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,541
[Max]
Well, it's either a bomb or her lunch.

383
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,583
[Billy] In the kid's package.

384

That-- That's the doll!

-Oh, Billy.

00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,166
Okay, Billy.

388
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:13,916
There is going to be film showing
that there's a doll in this package?

389
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,875
Oh, sure, that's easy, Max.

390
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:17,250
Just-- Just an insert.

391
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:20,000
[engine starts]

392
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:23,416
And the bomb?

393
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:33,791
[Max] And if there is a bomb,
when does it blow up?

394
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:37,541
[stammering] Well,
we don't actually know.

395
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:43,625
What do we know?

396
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,375
You-- You better ask Jake. I better read the script.

397
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,375
[Billy clears throat]

398
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:56,708
Oh. There isn't one.

399
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:02,708
Jake is just making it up
as he goes along.

400
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:06,333
He's done it before.

401
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:10,250
[journalist] Dream projections
of Hannaford himself.

402
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:11,958
Man, they're real.

403
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:14,125
He made them real.
He gave them existence.

404
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:16,333
He molded them out of clay.

405
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:18,416
[camerawoman]
Or cut them out with scissors.

406
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,750
He conceived them.

407
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:21,375
Like a God.

408
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,916
A terrible and jealous God.

409
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,333
That's what he's been
with this new boy of his.

410
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:30,583
John Dale
is Hannaford's personal creation.

411
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:33,000
There's something else, too. An even stronger claim.

412
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:38,250
Very much in the Hannaford style.

413
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:40,833
[engine idles]

414
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:48,916
[Billy] Understand, Max,
this isn't even a rough cut.

415
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:52,208
-[Max] Sure.
-[Billy] You have to see the rest.

416
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:54,583
And Jake's gonna have to shoot it.

417
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:56,458
Oh, like I told you, Max,

418
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:59,458
an awful lot of the footage is
out at the ranch.

419
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:02,291
We'll be screening it for you...
at the party.

420
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:05,041
[Max] Tell Jake he wasted my time.

-[female guest 2] He's over there.
-Oh, yeah.

429
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,666
[interviewer] Nobody can do it like you,
Ms. Valeska.

430
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,833
No. Nobody.

431
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,958
-[whistles] Keep moving.
-[photographer] Add another four feet.

432
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:52,416
It's open season tonight, Mr. Otterlake.

433
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,250
We are in public domain.

434
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:56,500
[all laughing]

435
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:03,708
"Major studio" is a bullshit word,
but that's the word.

436
00:25:03,916 --> 00:25:05,958
I made a picture that made money.
That's what I had to do.

437
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:07,208
That's right. What about those people

438
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:09,083
who can't first make a picture
that makes money?

439
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:12,041
They're not interested in making a picture
that makes money. That's my point!

440
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:14,000
He's a man who could take a mediocre idea, and do something absolutely atrocious
with it.

441
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:18,833
-But it's absurd!
-[male guest 4] It's absurd. I thought--

442
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:20,208
Inevitably, the need to make money

443
00:25:20,291 --> 00:25:22,125
creates the need
for a certain kind of picture.

444
00:25:22,291 --> 00:25:23,333
And the picture...

445
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,708
-[Mazursky] Shh. That's Jewish logic.
-Oh, I'm Jewish.

446
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:29,041
-[female guest 3] That's your opinion.
-The ontology of its iconography...

447
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:30,958
is so incredibly facile.

448
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:33,625
If you indulged in aestheticism
for its own sake,

449
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:35,416
it could be called an abstract.

450
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,875
[male guest 5]
If the audience can't get it,

451
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:38,375
what's the point of going to the movie?

452
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:39,791
[Hopper] I'm trying to, you know...

453
00:25:39,875 --> 00:25:42,291
I'd like to get John Wayne's audience
in to see my movie.

454
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:45,625
[Jaglom] You've got an entire revolution
going on in this country on every level.

455
00:25:45,708 --> 00:25:48,375
-It's not gonna be reflected in films?
-[Mazursky] It's not a revolution.

456
00:25:48,458 --> 00:25:50,166
-Not in the way you think it is.
-Well, okay.

457
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:53,000
There's still rich people,
poor people starving, and a middle class.

458
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:55,708
Why wouldn't they listen to me?
What assholes they were,

459
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:58,166
and what a dying dinosaur
they were involved in.

460
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:01,541
-Why are you defending a corrupt system?
-[Mazursky] I'm not defending the system!

461
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:03,458
You don't see the point at all.

462
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:04,541
I hate the system.

463
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:08,708
I think that it's relatively easy
to make a good... movie.

464
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:10,708
Not a great one.

465
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:12,416
That's... something else.

466
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,208
-Hannaford's new movie?
-You do know about that.

467
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:17,708
Yes, indeedy, ma'am.
We'll be seeing it here tonight.

468
00:26:17,791 --> 00:26:19,541
Not this character.
You won't be seeing him.

469
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:21,708
Not until they find an actor for it.

470
00:26:21,791 --> 00:26:24,833
"Mostly, we're just supposed to feel him
spying on the boy

471
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:28,208
and on the girl, too, of course...
from the shadows."

472
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:30,083
Am I quoting you correctly?
Of course I am.

473
00:26:30,166 --> 00:26:32,833
-[Baron] Of course.
-She has total recall.

474
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,666
And a perfectly splendid imagination.

475
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,375
Don't try and be cute.
Answer the question.

476
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:37,875
Would you just repeat it, please?

477
00:26:37,958 --> 00:26:39,291
I didn't think you asked anything.

478
00:26:39,458 --> 00:26:41,666
[sighs] I guess I haven't asked it.

479
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,166
I just want to know what he represents.

480
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,958
[Pister] Well, as I conceive of it,
this character in the film,

481
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:49,250
well, he's--
he's sort of a hermit living out there.

482
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:51,625
There is a possibility.

483
00:26:51,791 --> 00:26:54,458
A Peeping Tom. You tell us.

484
00:26:54,916 --> 00:26:56,416
This part, we didn't cast.

485
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:58,291
This old man.

486
00:26:58,958 --> 00:26:59,916
He's Hannaford.

487
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:03,416
Hannaford himself.

488
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:07,666
-[guests cheering and applauding]
-[camera shutters clicking]

489
00:27:08,666 --> 00:27:11,500
-[reporter 1] Mr. Hannaford!
-[reporter 2] Mr. Hannaford! Hey!

490
00:27:16,791 --> 00:27:18,916
Mr. Hannaford! Mr. Hannaford!<i> </i>It's me!

491
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,541
Happy birthday, Jake! Happy birthday!

492
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:23,458
-Mr. Hannaford? Mr. Hannaford?
-Happy birthday.

493
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,208
I'm Marvin P. Fassbender.

494
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,791
Of course you are.

495
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:32,833
[Fassbender] Mr. Hannaford? Mr. Hannaford?

496
00:27:39,041 --> 00:27:42,000
[indistinct chatter]

497
00:27:57,291 --> 00:27:59,708
[reporter 3] Mr. Otterlake,
is it true you're planning a Western?

498
00:27:59,791 --> 00:28:03,333
This is Mr. Hannaford's night.
Let's save the questions for him, huh?

499
00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:05,166
You two are very close, aren't you?

500
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,083
Yes, I'd like to ask you about that.

501
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:09,291
-Why?
-Come on, Otterlake. [groans]

502
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:11,458
Why do you think you have to be
as rude as he is?

503
00:28:11,541 --> 00:28:13,416
As rude as you are. In print, anyway...

504
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,041
-I liked your last picture.
-Yeah, sure.

505
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,750
No, I know that it was--
it was repetitive...

506
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:19,958
[stutters] ...but, uh, uh... But I, oh...

507
00:28:20,041 --> 00:28:23,375
And... Oh, shit.
For what it was, it worked.

508
00:28:23,458 --> 00:28:25,916
Yeah, well, she wasn't that kind to me
in her review.

509
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,125
Not that you did much harm.
How much harm can you do

510
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:30,416
to the third biggest grosser
in movie history?

511
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,666
Did it really make that much?
How marvelous.

512
00:28:32,791 --> 00:28:35,583
Yes. Did you know that when
his own production company goes public,

513
00:28:35,666 --> 00:28:39,250
that your friend there stands to walk away
with $40 million.

514
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:41,916
-[Jake] Forty million dollars?
-And she'll keep on writing

515
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,875
that I stole everything from you, Skipper.

516
00:28:43,958 --> 00:28:47,416
-I'm never going to walk away from that.
-It's all right to borrow from each other.

517
00:28:47,541 --> 00:28:49,458
What we must never do
is borrow from ourselves.

518
00:28:49,541 --> 00:28:52,166
[guests laugh]

519
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,708
Of course you are close, you two.

520
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,625
You have to be.

521
00:28:58,791 --> 00:29:00,083
You have no choice.

522
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:04,041
Please, dear lady...

523
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:07,083
don't tell us what you mean by that.

524
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:08,958
[guests laugh]

525
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:10,583
[chuckling]

526
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:16,083
[Matt] Kill the music, will you?
They're still shooting Zarah there.

527
00:29:16,166 --> 00:29:17,916
That's what she wanted,
don't you think?

528
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,125
Okay, if she says so.

529
00:29:19,208 --> 00:29:21,125
She's picking up the tab. [chuckles]

530
00:29:21,416 --> 00:29:24,791
Gypsies, jazz, and mariachis,
all for a bunch of creeps

531
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:27,000
who only want to listen
to themselves talking.

532
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:28,416
Jesus Christ, I tell you!

533
00:29:28,875 --> 00:29:31,375
[crewman]
Zarah Valeska, take one, scene two.

534
00:29:32,416 --> 00:29:34,333
[interviewer] Zarah,
speaking of great men,

535
00:29:34,416 --> 00:29:36,541
your name has been linked romantically

536
00:29:36,625 --> 00:29:38,458
with quite a few celebrities.

537
00:29:39,625 --> 00:29:42,541
Wasn't it understood
that we weren't going to talk

538
00:29:42,625 --> 00:29:43,625
about love affairs?

539
00:29:44,958 --> 00:29:47,708
What you agreed to talk
about is Mr. Hannaford.

540
00:29:47,791 --> 00:29:49,875
-A fascist, for Chrissake.
-[Otterlake] Hannaford? No.

541
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:53,208
-How about Jack Simon, right here?
-You tell us, Brooksie.

542
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:55,166
Jack's got it in his contract.
Right, Jack?

543
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:58,458
Every picture he directs,
he gets to shoot the animals personally...

544
00:29:58,541 --> 00:29:59,458
with a gun!

545
00:29:59,958 --> 00:30:02,916
-They even pay him off in guns.
-No, they pay me money, kid.

546
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,541
Oh. And they say I imitate him.

547
00:30:07,416 --> 00:30:10,541
Well, that's your thing, Otterlake,
you're good at imitations.

548
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,750
[young woman] Do Jack Benny.

549
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:14,458
[man 6] He's the one that's into guns.

550
00:30:14,541 --> 00:30:16,541
A fascist? Shall we define our terms? Spades, spics, micks, hunkies,

551
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:21,416
honkies, hebes, those kind of terms?

552
00:30:21,916 --> 00:30:24,666
Fasci-tists?
We don't like them kinda people.

553
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:27,000
-What kind of people does he like?
-Nobody.

554
00:30:27,291 --> 00:30:28,291
Nobody at all.

555
00:30:28,833 --> 00:30:30,208
Nobody in the plural.

556
00:30:30,416 --> 00:30:32,166
And then, who in the particular?

557
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:36,458
Mr. Otterlake, for instance. Ms. Valeska.

558
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:41,958
[interviewer] Uh, it's been reported
that you call him, uh, GF sometimes.

559
00:30:42,791 --> 00:30:44,333
Jokingly, of course.

560
00:30:44,666 --> 00:30:45,791
Is that right?

561
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:48,166
GF meaning "God the Father."

562
00:30:49,833 --> 00:30:51,458
I call Mr. Hannaford... [sighs]

563
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:53,125
...Mr. Hannaford.

564
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:56,083
[Otterlake, on recording] <i>God isn't dead.</i>
<i>Reflection of your attitude.</i>

565
00:30:56,541 --> 00:30:57,791
<i>Right, Mr. Hannaford?</i>

566
00:30:57,958 --> 00:31:00,166
[Jake, on recording]
<i>Well, kid. He's certainly Jewish.</i>

567
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,333
Thus spaketh Jake.

568
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:02,750
What's that about?

569
00:31:02,833 --> 00:31:06,083
-One of your old tapes, Brooksie?
-[Otterlake] I deeded them to the cause.

570
00:31:06,458 --> 00:31:09,833
-[man 7] From that book you're doing?
-[Otterlake] From the one we're not doing.

571
00:31:09,916 --> 00:31:12,833
[man 5] You're the first big director
that ever tried to write about him.

572
00:31:12,916 --> 00:31:15,291
The first one to give up.
But I still know all the material.

573
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:16,375
You know, religion...

574
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:19,125
Here it is,
the Gospel According to Jake.

575
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:22,625
"God the Father is an old Jew...

576
00:31:23,125 --> 00:31:25,166
invented by a lot of other old Jews...

577
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,708
in a hopeless attempt
to put down the Jewish mother."

578
00:31:27,791 --> 00:31:29,875
-[guests laugh]
-[male guest 7] Jewish mother?

579
00:31:29,958 --> 00:31:33,041
That's what the whole new scene's about,
you know? Everything...

580
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,833
-even his movie.
-Um, what's that about the movie?

581
00:31:35,916 --> 00:31:38,291
-You mean the one--
-We don't talk about the movie.

582
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:39,583
Try the Baron here.

583
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,041
Under torture, he might squeal a little.

584
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:45,458
-He writes the scripts.
-So Mr. Hannaford likes to say.

585
00:31:45,666 --> 00:31:48,625
Please, don't pretend to be stupid.
Now, you're supposed to be the brainy one

586
00:31:48,708 --> 00:31:51,125
in this club or this, I don't know,
this clan, whatever--

587
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:53,583
It's a highly informal organization, lady.

588
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:55,208
The tape that we were hearing.

589
00:31:55,291 --> 00:31:57,041
The subject is God. Is he a member?

590
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:57,958
She.

591
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,083
We're all ruled by the wind,
aren't we, lady?

592
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:05,583
So, uh, if the Lord is a lady,

593
00:32:05,666 --> 00:32:07,291
and God's will is Her will,

594
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:08,833
then we can all relax and...

595
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:11,416
stop expecting the universe to be logical.

596
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:13,458
[Otterlake] You heard the man, lady.

597
00:32:13,708 --> 00:32:15,500
"We're right back where we started.

598
00:32:16,416 --> 00:32:17,458
Back to Mama."

599
00:32:17,541 --> 00:32:19,750
[Jack]
Now, that's when Brooksie's at his best.

600
00:32:19,833 --> 00:32:22,583
When he's using
straight Hannaford dialogue.

601
00:32:23,416 --> 00:32:25,250
Gee, that's real nice, Jack,
coming from you.

602
00:32:27,375 --> 00:32:29,791
-[Rich] What I'd like to clarify...
-Yes?

603
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:32,041
-is... um...
-Yes?

604
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:36,250
-Is... Is...
-[Otterlake] Mm-hmm?

605
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:39,208
how his disciple feels
about the new Hannaford film.

606
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,458
-[Otterlake] Who?
-Who? You.

607
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:45,041
Hey, why pick on me?
The man is infested with disciples.

608
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:46,541
I'm the apostle, lady.

609
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,916
Sure, just like Saint Paul.
I know the lyrics to that one, too.

610
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,083
Oh, we're sure you do, Brooksie. Uh--

611
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:54,750
Yeah. The Apostle Paul packaged it.

612
00:32:55,166 --> 00:32:56,541
You know, by now, Jesus was dead--

613
00:32:56,625 --> 00:32:59,833
-[Jack] You tell us--
-Be quiet about 30 seconds. And, um...

614
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:02,041
so the subject was in public domain,

615
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:03,916
and, um... um...

616
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:05,958
Let's see, now. Where was I, folks?

617
00:33:06,041 --> 00:33:07,083
[guests laughing]

618
00:33:07,583 --> 00:33:09,916
So, when Paul dreamed up Christianity...

619
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:11,708
and...

620
00:33:11,791 --> 00:33:14,083
-[cameras rolling]
-[people laughing]

621
00:33:15,416 --> 00:33:17,625
...and stuck the -anity into Christ--

622
00:33:17,708 --> 00:33:21,333
As long as I'm still twitching, Brooksie,
you ain't gonna stick it into me.

623
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,833
-[guests laughing]
-Isn't that just what he's doing?

624
00:33:24,125 --> 00:33:27,458
Movies and friendship.
Those are mysteries.

625
00:33:27,541 --> 00:33:31,041
And religion. The Baron's into that,
and I know his material, too.

626
00:33:31,125 --> 00:33:32,458
You ought to get away from both.

627
00:33:32,625 --> 00:33:35,083
[in a German accent]
"A mystery may reveal.

628
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:37,666
It never explains." Right?

629
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,500
Yes. Just like you, Mr. Hannaford.

630
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:42,333
Just like me and God.

631
00:33:42,708 --> 00:33:46,125
If it weren't for the difference in sex,
how could you tell us apart?

632
00:33:46,375 --> 00:33:48,375
[piano music playing]

633
00:33:49,625 --> 00:33:51,291
[Rich]
Are those supposed to be John Dale?

634
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:55,083
He asked for them.
It was Mr. Hannaford's idea.

635
00:33:55,958 --> 00:33:56,791
How's this one?

636
00:33:57,458 --> 00:33:58,583
Fine, Joey.

637
00:34:00,458 --> 00:34:02,250
So, how do they look? Hmm?

638
00:34:04,916 --> 00:34:06,375
Stupid, that's how they look.

639
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,708
[Matt] Your leading man.
The poor, sick, hungry kid

you pulled out of the water
and stuck into pictures.

641
00:34:14,416 --> 00:34:17,708
The orphan, Mr. Johnny Dale.
Do you know where he came from?

642
00:34:18,375 --> 00:34:19,875
Where he <i>really </i>came from?

643
00:34:20,083 --> 00:34:24,083
A big rich family in Ohio.
How do you like them apples, huh?

644
00:34:24,458 --> 00:34:27,041
[Matt] Yeah,
he didn't break out of any reformatory.

645
00:34:27,541 --> 00:34:31,541
He graduated from boarding school,
one of the snotty, expensive ones.

646
00:34:32,041 --> 00:34:35,708
We found one of his teachers.
He's coming right out here with Billy.

647
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:38,083
[Jake]
Billy's supposed to bring Max David.

648
00:34:38,166 --> 00:34:39,583
When is he joining the party?

649
00:34:40,458 --> 00:34:41,333
He isn't.

650
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:43,250
No?

651
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:46,333
-Any word from Texas?
-The oil money?

652
00:34:49,291 --> 00:34:50,125
Not yet.

653
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,375
Well, here it is...

654
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,875
if anybody wants to see it.

655
00:34:57,583 --> 00:35:00,208
[interviewer] Darling, this marvelous bash
you're giving him,

656
00:35:00,291 --> 00:35:04,416
and if I understand, your whole idea
was to get Jake Hannaford in touch

657
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,875
with the new generation.

658
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:08,500
And vice versa. Yes. [sighs]

659
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,875
[interviewer]
Very few of your guests are his own age.

660
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:16,958
Most people of Mr. Hannaford's age
are too old for him.

661
00:35:17,041 --> 00:35:18,166
[Jake] Hey, beautiful.

662
00:35:19,875 --> 00:35:20,708
Hello.

663
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,666
We don't have much of a past...
do we, beautiful?

664
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,333
We made just half of a picture together.

665
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:29,458
That was in Ms. Valeska's country.

666
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,375
[Valeska] In Austria.

667
00:35:31,666 --> 00:35:33,541
-[interviewer] What happened?
-Hitler.

668
00:35:33,708 --> 00:35:35,625
-That's what happened.
-[interviewer] He threw you out?

669
00:35:35,958 --> 00:35:37,250
She threw him out.

670
00:35:38,416 --> 00:35:40,083
Her USO Troop led our...

671
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:43,625
armies into battle.
I witnessed it from the rear.

672
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,708
But you did liberate the Ritz.

673
00:35:45,791 --> 00:35:48,250
No, her friend Hemingway put in
for that one.

674
00:35:48,375 --> 00:35:50,291
Jake was three bottles ahead of him.

675
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:51,750
Where did you come from?

676
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:53,541
The studio.

677
00:35:53,875 --> 00:35:55,041
Jake, I told you.

678
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,083
Hemingway? [sighs]

679
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,875
That left hook of his was overrated.

680
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:04,500
"Every man contains within himself...

681
00:36:05,291 --> 00:36:07,333
the whole condition of humanity."

682
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:08,875
Write that down, somebody.

683
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,208
Somebody did.

684
00:36:10,666 --> 00:36:12,125
She even gave me the book.

685
00:36:12,291 --> 00:36:14,750
Mr. Hannaford enjoys
pretending to be ignorant.

686
00:36:14,833 --> 00:36:17,125
Then she spoiled the present by, uh...

687
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,041
telling me who gave it to her.

688
00:36:19,125 --> 00:36:20,125
[interviewer] Who?

689
00:36:20,208 --> 00:36:22,458
Oh, just someone
he doesn't happen to like.

690
00:36:22,541 --> 00:36:24,250
The queers adore great women.

691
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:28,125
They like all women, Uncle.
They're the only sex that does.

692
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:29,041
True.

693
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:33,500
Real men never like us. Men only like men.

694
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:34,583
And, um...

695
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:37,041
Women keep us away from each other.

696
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:40,500
"Ah, but if I cut him off,"
we ask ourselves.

697

"Cut him off from all his good companions,

what will be left of him?

00:36:46,416 --> 00:36:47,708
An amputee, perhaps?

who is not only a great artist,

706
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:09,583
but one who's been called
the Ernest Hemingway of the cinema.

707
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:14,958
The Murnau of the American motion picture.
Who Murnau is, I don't remember.

708
00:37:15,625 --> 00:37:17,875
Let me see...
Murnau and Dean, the vaudeville act.

709
00:37:17,958 --> 00:37:20,541
As I recall,
they played in either Lowes Newark,

710
00:37:20,625 --> 00:37:23,083
or Pickleton on Thames in Great Britain.

711

It'll take a lot of blowing.

718

That should be a job for Ms. Rich.

719

-Because it doesn't work.
-[Baron] What doesn't work?

768
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,250
-The projector.
-[Baron] Which projector?

769
00:49:45,333 --> 00:49:46,458
Both of them.

770
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:48,291
[indistinct chatter]

771
00:49:48,458 --> 00:49:49,708
[man 6] What happened, Jake?

772
00:49:49,791 --> 00:49:52,125
Who knows. Johnny Dale, maybe.

773
00:49:52,291 --> 00:49:53,833
-[Otterlake] Dale?
-[Jake] Could have snuck

774
00:49:53,916 --> 00:49:55,916
into the generator
with his monkey wrench.

775
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,750
[man 8] What is this,
another energy crisis?

776
00:49:58,833 --> 00:50:00,208
[Fassbender] Too many camera lights.

777
00:50:00,291 --> 00:50:03,333
Never went in much for symbolism,
did we, Baron?

778
00:50:03,416 --> 00:50:06,208
[man 2, over megaphone]
<i>All right now, let me have your attention.</i>

779
00:50:06,458 --> 00:50:08,791
<i>We've got a power failure on our hands.</i>

780
00:50:09,208 --> 00:50:11,916
<i>The ranch's generators have broken down.</i>

781
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,791
<i>But, we hope</i>
<i>the situation will be temporary.</i>

782
00:50:16,458 --> 00:50:20,458
<i>Meanwhile, we'll be getting lamps for you</i>
<i>from out in the stables</i>

783
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:22,458
<i>and lighting up candles,</i>

784

[man 9] All passengers to the lifeboats.

791

Our gallant musicians will keep
right on till the end.

792
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:48,458
They can't see the notes, but that's
all right, they can't read them.

793
00:50:48,708 --> 00:50:52,250
Abe, how nice to see you looking so old.

794
00:50:52,541 --> 00:50:54,750
-[crewman] Getting anything?
-[camerawoman] Not with color.

795
00:50:54,833 --> 00:50:56,750
[crewman] Black and white, maybe?

796
00:50:56,833 --> 00:50:58,500
Whistling in the dark, old man?

797
00:50:58,583 --> 00:51:01,625
Well, kid, you whistle or you whimper.
How is it in your corner?

798
00:51:01,708 --> 00:51:03,375
[Abe] Who got him an invitation?

799
00:51:03,458 --> 00:51:05,291
Confrontation's the word for it.

800
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:09,541
-Abe, take it up with the hostess.
-Zarah? You must be nuts.

801
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:12,375
Mother seems to think a little young blood
would be good for us.

802
00:51:12,458 --> 00:51:15,291
-[male guest 8] She could be right.
-Well, she's always right.

803
00:51:16,208 --> 00:51:17,166
Excuse me, fellas,

804
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:19,416
I think we have ourselves
a confrontation.

805
00:51:19,666 --> 00:51:23,458
I dig. It's not that he didn't make
any female stars.

806
00:51:23,791 --> 00:51:26,291
It's just that he didn't make them stars.

807
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:27,750
That's my whole thesis.

808
00:51:27,916 --> 00:51:30,000
Great thesis.
So, the old man can still score.

809
00:51:30,083 --> 00:51:31,083
Who says so?

810
00:51:31,541 --> 00:51:34,458
How he scores, and who he scores with.

811
00:51:35,208 --> 00:51:37,916
That, my friend, gets us
into some very interesting country.

812
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:42,708
-[interviewer] Okay, Zarah, no romance.
-You meant with Mr. Hannaford, I suppose?

813
00:51:42,916 --> 00:51:44,125
There wasn't any.

814
00:51:44,208 --> 00:51:47,541
[interviewer] I do wish you could open up
just a little on Jake.

815
00:51:47,625 --> 00:51:48,791
No sex at all.

-Dr. Burroughs.

818
00:52:01,291 --> 00:52:04,625
[Billy] We have our own generator.
This sometimes happens.

819
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:06,791
These are our storyboards. [Burroughs] Oh, oh.

820
00:52:08,958 --> 00:52:10,916
-All-- All these.
-Oh.

821
00:52:11,166 --> 00:52:12,958
-Here.
-Oh, thank you.

822
00:52:13,416 --> 00:52:15,750
[filmmaker 10] These show
they're going for a closer shot.

823
00:52:15,833 --> 00:52:18,375
-[man 7] A zoom or a dolly?
-[filmmaker 10] Doesn't make a difference.

824
00:52:18,458 --> 00:52:23,416
-[man 7] Of course it does.
-[filmmaker 10] Looks like a crutch.

825
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,416
Some people are old fashioned.

826
00:52:27,083 --> 00:52:29,750
[male guest 8] Jake,
he started out in silent movies.

827
00:52:30,041 --> 00:52:31,125
He goes way back.

828
00:52:31,791 --> 00:52:32,916
The movie he's making now,

829
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,458
-it's a real departure for him.
-[male guest 10] He's losing it.

830
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
-[camerawoman] Run the cable?
-[cameraman] I'm good here.

831
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:43,666
-[camerawoman] Watch the boom.
-He's coming.

832
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:47,958
[Jake] Tomorrow's Sunday, Mavis.
You'll be flying down with us to Mexico.

833
00:52:48,041 --> 00:52:50,083
-[Mavis] What for?
-<i>Montaña rojas.</i>

834
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,541
-[Mavis] Who?
-Bulls.

835
00:52:52,166 --> 00:52:56,583
A very dangerous breed, sweetie.
One of them once killed a friend of ours.

836
00:52:57,333 --> 00:52:59,666
We'll see what happens
to our new boy tomorrow.

837
00:52:59,833 --> 00:53:02,416
[Mavis] Gee, I don't know.
I have school on Monday.

838
00:53:02,958 --> 00:53:06,333
I'll write a note to your teacher.

Who's the joker with the cigarette?

840
00:53:08,666 --> 00:53:09,500
Miguel.

841
00:53:09,583 --> 00:53:11,083
[Baron] He was the best of all.

842
00:53:11,166 --> 00:53:12,333
[man 5] Best of what?

843
00:53:12,416 --> 00:53:17,125
[man 9] The best of all our bullfighters.
We followed old Miguel all over Spain.

844
00:53:17,666 --> 00:53:20,791
That's Jake, aiming his gun at him
in the shooting gallery.

845
00:53:20,875 --> 00:53:21,833
[Jake] Another birthday.

846
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,583
What a party that was. [laughs]

847
00:53:25,666 --> 00:53:27,750
No bums, no movie buffs,

848
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:30,041
no spies, no spooks, just...

849
00:53:30,333 --> 00:53:31,958
paid-up members of the club.

850
00:53:32,291 --> 00:53:34,625
-[man 5] Miguel Ortega.
-[Baron] The best.

851
00:53:34,958 --> 00:53:37,041
-Number one.
-Till he got killed. [man 5] Dad,
I hope you weren't responsible for that.

852
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:41,083
I just had one shot at him.

853
00:53:41,166 --> 00:53:42,000
I missed.

854
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:44,416
-[Billy] But he got the cigarette.
-[laughter]

855
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:45,833
Get that spook out of here.

856

-[camera rolling]
-[Baron yelling]

857
00:53:48,041 --> 00:53:49,666
Get out of here!

858
00:53:50,041 --> 00:53:52,000
[Baron] Respect Mr. Hannaford's privacy.

859
00:53:52,083 --> 00:53:53,958
You, too. [scoffs]

860

[jukebox clicking]

861
00:53:56,416 --> 00:53:59,000
[man 9] Hey Billy,
why don't you leave that jukebox alone?

862
00:53:59,083 --> 00:54:01,000
That thing doesn't work with solar energy.

863
00:54:01,083 --> 00:54:02,625
I need some new music.

864
00:54:02,875 --> 00:54:04,250
And you shall have it, boy,

865
00:54:04,333 --> 00:54:05,416
wherever you go.

866
00:54:05,958 --> 00:54:08,250
A one, and a two and a three.

867
00:54:08,416 --> 00:54:10,416
[upbeat instrumental music playing]

868

[man 2] Where the hell's Matt?
He should be taking this call.

870
00:54:21,416 --> 00:54:23,125
Stupid, that's how they look.

871
00:54:24,291 --> 00:54:25,125
Yeah?

872
00:54:27,083 --> 00:54:29,291
Oh, go on, then, Zimmie. Have a drink.

873
00:54:29,583 --> 00:54:31,166
Oh, how could I?

874
00:54:34,041 --> 00:54:34,875
Besides...

875
00:54:35,958 --> 00:54:37,916
I don't know these people.

876
00:54:38,166 --> 00:54:40,208
It's a whole new business.

877
00:54:42,166 --> 00:54:44,791
These leading actors nowadays... [sighs]

878
00:54:45,875 --> 00:54:47,666
...stars, even. [chuckles]

879
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,416
I don't know their names.

880
00:54:49,916 --> 00:54:53,666
You know the dummy's name?
Old Pat here says we can never guess.

881
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:54,958
John Dale?

882
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:57,375
Oscar, that was his real name.

883
00:54:57,833 --> 00:55:00,041
You know,
at school, what he was famous for?

884
00:55:00,125 --> 00:55:01,250
Fornication?

885
00:55:01,625 --> 00:55:05,583
We got somebody coming here tonight
who's going to tell us all about it.

886
00:55:06,458 --> 00:55:07,291
Yeah?

887
00:55:08,458 --> 00:55:10,916
-[Maggie] Darryl Zanuck?
-[Pat] Got a message for him.

888
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,416
It's for Pocahontas,
or whatever it is Jake calls her.

889
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,375
She's in there, at the screening.

890
00:55:16,458 --> 00:55:19,250
Come on in, Zimmie.
Join the fun and games.

891
00:55:20,458 --> 00:55:23,583
[Pister] All those Mr. Dales of yours
are certainly lifelike.

892
00:55:24,916 --> 00:55:26,208
So is Mr. Dale.

893
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,583
To look at him,
you'd swear he was real.

[guests chattering]

895
00:55:31,541 --> 00:55:35,583
[Matt] I got a message
for you, Minnehaha. It's for you.

896
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:39,666
From Zanuck. Call the secretary
first thing Monday morning

897
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:40,750
for an appointment.

898
00:55:40,833 --> 00:55:43,625
-He's got a picture for her.
-Darryl? Swell.

899
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:46,041
-When's he joining the party?
-He isn't.

900
00:55:46,458 --> 00:55:49,208
The Hannaford mafia isn't looking
very festive. What's--

901
00:55:49,291 --> 00:55:52,375
-What's the big worry, Skipper?
-They like to worry.

902
00:55:54,416 --> 00:55:55,750
Worry is their thing.

903
00:55:55,833 --> 00:55:57,333
Four days is a long time.

904
00:55:57,541 --> 00:55:59,666
-Four days until what?
-[Jake] Friday.

905
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:00,791
Thanks, sweetie.

906
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,416
-[Otterlake] Could you get me one, please?
-What?

907
00:56:07,625 --> 00:56:08,833
[Otterlake] What's Friday?

908
00:56:09,166 --> 00:56:10,166
Friday we, um...

909
00:56:10,625 --> 00:56:11,541
close down.

910
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,208
[Otterlake] Jesus, you can't finish
the picture in four days.

911
00:56:15,458 --> 00:56:17,625
I've been overscheduled before.

912
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:18,750
Let's drink to that.

913
00:56:21,291 --> 00:56:23,833
How many times
have you been broke, Skipper?

914
00:56:25,166 --> 00:56:30,541
At my present age, Brooksie, um...
just, um... once.

915
00:56:31,875 --> 00:56:33,875
[laughs]

916
00:56:34,125 --> 00:56:36,458
Oh, terrific. It's nice being alone.

[Jake] Yes, Mavis.

924
00:56:57,291 --> 00:56:59,333
They got the projector fixed.
Didn't you hear?

925

[Jake] Didn't we all.

926

Aren't you coming to the movie?

927
00:57:01,833 --> 00:57:03,958
Yes,
but first we need a little more booze.

928
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:06,500
We wouldn't want to go in there alone now,
would we?

929
00:57:06,583 --> 00:57:07,666
Oh.

930

He's in there. With all--
With all the other guests.

934

Watching himself on the screen, isn't he?

935

Isn't who?

936

-Oscar... Oh, John, John Dale.
-[projectionist] Yeah?

937
00:58:24,416 --> 00:58:26,750
Yes, your leading man.

[projectionist]
Not my leading man, buddy boy.

939
00:58:51,041 --> 00:58:55,375
You've seen this before.
How is it that they don't have any...

940
00:58:55,958 --> 00:58:56,958
clothes?

941
00:58:57,125 --> 00:58:58,083
They got wet.

942
00:58:58,583 --> 00:58:59,583
In the other reel.

943
00:58:59,833 --> 00:59:01,208
-Wet?
-She didn't know him,

944
00:59:01,291 --> 00:59:04,833

That was last night in this other reel.

945

And now it's today.
She took off her clothes in the toilet...

his pants hung up to dry on the train.

It's funny...

I don't see one of those men
here at your party tonight.

Ask Mr. Hannaford. He knows
everything in Shakespeare.

978
01:02:39,875 --> 01:02:41,666
Shakespeare,
that's the Hannaford family curse.

979
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:44,833
He knows everything about the Hannafords,
which is my curse.

980
01:02:45,166 --> 01:02:47,166
Everybody knows about ol' Granddad.

[Otterlake]
Junius the First, in the tinsel toga.

982
01:02:50,958 --> 01:02:53,875
His limbs were always covered
in dirty pink tights.

983
01:02:53,958 --> 01:02:55,708
So as not to, um...

984

inflame the female members
of his audience.

985
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:01,375
Right, Skipper? That's where
the Shakespeare first comes from.

986
01:03:01,458 --> 01:03:03,291
[photographer] Mr. Hannaford,
would you sit

987
01:03:03,375 --> 01:03:05,000
on the ancestral throne, Mr. Hannaford? [Otterlake] Shall we give them a picture?

988
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,541
Shall we not? [chuckles]
Later, okay?

-[Rich] Come on, let's go.
-[Otterlake] Way later.

[Rich] This is a waste of time anyway.

The noblest Roman.

992
01:03:41,833 --> 01:03:42,708
Mm-hmm.

01:03:43,916 --> 01:03:45,166
Shanty Irish.

Lace curtain.

995
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,041
Like Seneca,

996
01:03:52,625 --> 01:03:54,291
he bled to death in the bathtub.

997
01:03:57,458 --> 01:03:59,166
One of the few times he'd ever...

998
01:03:59,625 --> 01:04:00,791
sat in one.

999
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:16,166
Now, Junius Junior...

1000
01:04:16,291 --> 01:04:17,458
Yeah, he, uh...

1001
01:04:18,583 --> 01:04:21,166
He really made it into high society.
Piss-elegant.

That's me, Skipper. That's me.

1007
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:39,625
Then, um...

1008
01:04:41,333 --> 01:04:43,041
you know about the chandelier.

1009
01:04:49,458 --> 01:04:50,500
I'm the authority.

1010
01:04:52,666 --> 01:04:55,125
The old Hollywood Hotel, was it?

1011
01:05:07,333 --> 01:05:09,708
They found him one Sunday morning.

1012
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:13,041
Hanging from it.

After which, you had to go to work
for a living.

1015
01:05:22,166 --> 01:05:23,625
So, what do you do next?

1016
01:05:25,333 --> 01:05:26,791
[Jake] What does anybody do?

1017

[camera rolling]

1018
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:37,375
And he's on all the credits
of Jake's screenplays.

1019
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:38,333
Right?

1020
01:05:38,458 --> 01:05:40,166
I amuse Mr. Hannaford.

1021
01:05:40,666 --> 01:05:41,958
He has curious pleasures.

1022

Games, he likes to play games.

1023

I'm a writer who stopped writing
one afternoon in Budapest in 1929.

Do I have a camera? Oh.

-he's not what you think, you know?
-Lions are cats.

1029

And Jake, my dear, is a cat.

1030
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,208
A cat that walks like a bear. I'd call him a necromancer.

01:09:18,458 --> 01:09:20,875
[Jake] <i>Both cameras.</i>
<i>I'd like a record of this.</i>

1077
01:09:20,958 --> 01:09:22,333
<i>That's it. Hold it on him.</i>

1078
01:09:22,416 --> 01:09:24,416
<i>And goodbye, Johnny Dale.</i>

1079
01:09:33,208 --> 01:09:34,833
Hey, look what you dropped.

1080
01:09:35,083 --> 01:09:38,625
Fifteen precious minutes of Hannaford.
Every little bit...

1081
01:09:38,708 --> 01:09:42,166
added to what we've got,
makes it just that much more.

1082
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:44,958
-[chattering]
-[male guest 11] I told those guys

1083
01:09:45,041 --> 01:09:47,583
those spots were too much.
Where's the circuit breaker? -[female guest 4] A circuit breaker?
-[male guest 11] I'm pulling up.

1084
01:09:51,458 --> 01:09:52,833
Oh, not again.

1085
01:09:54,791 --> 01:09:56,958
[man 9] We are blacked out for good.

1086
01:09:57,250 --> 01:09:58,791
-Excuse me.
-[murmurs]

1087
01:09:58,875 --> 01:10:02,208
[man 9] Just watch the birthrate
nine months from tonight.

1088
01:10:02,416 --> 01:10:04,833
[Billy] What happened?
Did that gennie break down again?

1089
01:10:05,166 --> 01:10:07,958
[Otterlake] Twice in one night.
This is no accident. It's sabotage.

1090
01:10:08,041 --> 01:10:11,250
Good heavens. Who do you suspect?
This cineaste?

1091
01:10:11,333 --> 01:10:13,500
He wouldn't know a cineaste
from a hole in the ground.

1092
01:10:13,583 --> 01:10:15,291
Probably a midget with a grudge.

1093
01:10:15,916 --> 01:10:16,916
I saw your film.

1094
01:10:17,291 --> 01:10:19,208
You won't see any more of it tonight.

1095
01:10:19,291 --> 01:10:20,375
Why not?

1096
01:10:20,541 --> 01:10:22,958
No lights, no projection, dum-dum.

1097
01:10:23,041 --> 01:10:25,791
-[Billy] Excuse me.
-Besides, I didn't make it.

1098
01:10:25,958 --> 01:10:29,958
You will, kid. You will.
Let me tell you what I think of it.

1099
01:10:30,208 --> 01:10:32,333
Get us a drink, will you, sweetie?

1100
01:10:32,583 --> 01:10:35,625
Just look for Jake Hannaford.
He glows in the dark.

1101
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,750
-Right, Brooksie?
-[Jake grunts]

1102
01:10:38,083 --> 01:10:39,875
What you imitate is him.

1103
01:10:40,458 --> 01:10:43,083
The man, not the movie; your idea of him.

1104
01:10:43,166 --> 01:10:46,125
You know, the bull fights
and the big game,

1105
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:47,625
the whole macho bit.

1106
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:49,833
Now, the truth of the matter is...

1107
01:10:50,458 --> 01:10:51,833
that as a macho,

1108
01:10:52,125 --> 01:10:53,291
he ain't all that much.

1109
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:55,833
That chest ain't near as hairy

1110
01:10:55,916 --> 01:10:58,375
as he'd like you to think. Yeah.

1111
01:10:58,916 --> 01:11:02,125
Your guy's a big pink lobster.

1112
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:04,000
Nothing's really tough.

1113
01:11:04,541 --> 01:11:05,791
Except the shell.

1114
01:11:06,083 --> 01:11:09,000
Now what?
I ask you what's so tough about you,

1115
01:11:09,083 --> 01:11:11,708
and you ask me if I wouldn't like
to find out. Then we...

1116
01:11:11,791 --> 01:11:15,000
entertain the folks with a good
old-fashioned Hollywood fistfight?

1117
01:11:15,125 --> 01:11:16,041
Well...

1118
01:11:18,083 --> 01:11:19,833
if that's the way you want it, kid.

1119
01:11:19,916 --> 01:11:22,000
[Otterlake] Old-fashioned is the word,
all right,

1120
01:11:22,083 --> 01:11:23,750
even in the way you do Hannaford.

1121
01:11:23,833 --> 01:11:26,333
Maybe he was like that, 30 years ago.

1122
01:11:26,583 --> 01:11:28,666
I'll give him... 40 years.

1123
01:11:29,708 --> 01:11:32,166
My Jake can still lick the shit
out of yours.

1124
01:11:32,958 --> 01:11:34,958
-[Jack gasps]
-[sighs]

1125
01:11:37,416 --> 01:11:40,208
-What the hell did you do that for?
-I wasn't even here.

1126
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:41,958
This is all going on film, you know.

1127
01:11:44,083 --> 01:11:45,750
[Billy] Come on, get him out of here.

1128
01:11:45,833 --> 01:11:49,250
-[waiter] Got him? Three, two...
-[men grunting]

1129
01:11:52,416 --> 01:11:55,416
Putting a little extra zing
on the old lobster's claw, Brooksie.

1130
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,250
I'd do the same for you.

1131
01:11:57,333 --> 01:11:59,166
We imitation Hannafords...

1132
01:11:59,541 --> 01:12:01,041
have got to stick together.

1133
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:03,875
I brought that schoolteacher.
Remember?

1134
01:12:04,333 --> 01:12:06,166
You were supposed to bring Max David.

1135
01:12:06,416 --> 01:12:08,666
Jake, I-- I gotta talk to you about that.

1136
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:12,625
[waiters speaking indistinctly]

1137
01:12:12,708 --> 01:12:13,708
[Matt] No sweat.

1138
01:12:13,875 --> 01:12:16,750
A couple of wranglers will take him
to the local first aid.

1139
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:19,500
-[Billy] You think it'll be all right?
-Sure. [chuckles]

1140
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:23,250
We'll donate his motorcycle to charity.
[laughs]

1141
01:12:23,333 --> 01:12:26,125
Please, if you're gonna have a fight,
invite me.

1142
01:12:28,541 --> 01:12:29,791
[laughs]

1143
01:12:30,458 --> 01:12:32,250
Who told you I was broke?

1144
01:12:37,666 --> 01:12:38,500
Well...

1145
01:12:39,541 --> 01:12:40,416
Billy said...

1146
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:41,916
you sold the boat.

1147
01:12:42,041 --> 01:12:45,083
He did, did he?
How about the roof over my head?

1148
01:12:45,208 --> 01:12:46,416
How does that grab you?

1149
01:12:46,666 --> 01:12:47,833
You mean the ranch?

1150
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,208
[Jake] Out in the snow, kid.
Over the hill and down dale...

1151
01:12:53,041 --> 01:12:56,875
But let's not ever speak
of Master John Dale again.

1152
01:13:03,083 --> 01:13:06,000
Dale! Dale.

1153
01:13:06,375 --> 01:13:09,125
That's what really bugs you, isn't it?
Dale.

1154
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:12,166
All your troubles.
What's one lousy leading man?

1155
01:13:12,916 --> 01:13:16,875
Less than the dust
beneath my chariot wheels.

1156
01:13:20,958 --> 01:13:22,541
Cheers. I'll drink to that.

1157
01:13:26,833 --> 01:13:28,833
[sips]

1158
01:13:34,833 --> 01:13:37,041
[Baron] Is that for me? Thank you, Billy.

1159
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,791
-[Billy] Pass it on.
-[glass shatters]

1160
01:13:45,916 --> 01:13:46,875
Right on.

1161
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:52,500
[both laughing] [both pant and laugh]

1162
01:14:06,625 --> 01:14:09,041
[man 6] Billy. Hey!

1163
01:14:10,166 --> 01:14:13,208
-What are you doing, Billy? Smoking?
-What does it look like?

1164
01:14:13,333 --> 01:14:16,416
[man 6] The way things are going tonight,
it could be a reefer.

1165
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:18,291
Nowadays, we call 'em a joint.

1166
01:14:18,375 --> 01:14:21,291
[man 6] What do you need tea for?
You got gumdrops.

1167
01:14:21,875 --> 01:14:24,833
We know. That's to keep you off the juice.

1168
01:14:26,708 --> 01:14:27,875
He wants to see you.

1169
01:14:28,416 --> 01:14:29,250
[Billy] Yeah?

1170
01:14:31,166 --> 01:14:32,625
Well, I wanna see him.

1171
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:34,375
I've got that teacher waiting. I wanna--

1172
01:14:34,458 --> 01:14:36,416
-[man 6] Get on out there!
-Guess who joined us?

1173
01:14:36,541 --> 01:14:37,625
Herman the German.

1174
01:14:37,708 --> 01:14:38,708
[Jake] Hermie?

1175
01:14:40,333 --> 01:14:42,208
How's the boy? And you, Billy?

1176
01:14:42,333 --> 01:14:43,750
Jake, I just told you.

1177
01:14:43,833 --> 01:14:47,000
Kept you busy
just collecting schoolteachers?

1178
01:14:47,666 --> 01:14:49,958
Hey, can I please get myself
something to eat?

1179
01:14:50,041 --> 01:14:52,625
I wasn't just collecting schoolteachers.

1180
01:14:52,833 --> 01:14:54,250
Didn't they feed you?

1181
01:14:54,375 --> 01:14:56,666
All they do on airplanes is feed you.

1182
01:14:57,083 --> 01:14:59,166
Turbulence. Ooh.

1183
01:14:59,833 --> 01:15:01,125
You threw up.

1184
01:15:01,875 --> 01:15:03,666
Give him some candy, Billy.

1185
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:05,416
Jake, those oil guys...

1186
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:06,875
Keep the voices down.

1187
01:15:07,208 --> 01:15:09,250
These freaks got the whole joint
wired for sound.

1188
01:15:09,333 --> 01:15:11,458
I caught one of 'em bugging a cactus.

1189
01:15:11,541 --> 01:15:12,833
What about the old guy?

1190
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,291
Don't be bashful, Hermie.
We know the answer.

1191
01:15:15,375 --> 01:15:16,541
They want no part of us.

1192
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,416
Neither does Max.

1193
01:15:19,875 --> 01:15:21,500
-Right, Billy?
-Nah!

1194
01:15:21,875 --> 01:15:23,166
Max David, that dirty crook?

1195
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:24,583
-Who needs him?
-We do.

1196
01:15:25,041 --> 01:15:27,041
Max? He's so crooked,
he's got rubber pockets

1197
01:15:27,125 --> 01:15:28,791
so he can steal soup.

1198
01:15:29,166 --> 01:15:31,000
Our best chance was that oil money.

1199
01:15:31,375 --> 01:15:34,083
-[Billy] Otterlake, what about him?
-[Otterlake] Yeah, what about me?

1200
01:15:34,375 --> 01:15:38,833
Brooksie. We wondered if you knew
about the screening at the drive-in.

1201
01:15:39,041 --> 01:15:41,916
-We're screening the rest of the movie.
-He's seen the movie.

1202
01:15:42,375 --> 01:15:43,458
Not everything.

1203
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:47,041
Well, we-- we don't have everything.

1204
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:49,875
Leave it to Jake,
pretty soon you'll have too much.

1205
01:15:50,083 --> 01:15:52,375
You bet, we've had our troubles before.

1206
01:15:52,541 --> 01:15:55,000
Want your little friend
to get you a drink, uh, Skipper?

1207
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:58,333
-Thanks, Brooksie.
-He's Max's golden-haired boy, isn't he?

1208
01:15:58,708 --> 01:16:00,458
They gave Brooksie his own company.

1209
01:16:00,625 --> 01:16:05,000
-Come on. Tell us something we don't know.
-I brought that schoolteacher.

1210
01:16:05,125 --> 01:16:07,208
Jake will see him
if and when he feels like it.

1211
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:09,000
What about Max David?

1212
01:16:09,166 --> 01:16:12,166
That's who you were to bring out here,
right after the screening. He blew it.
Must be all that candy he eats.

1213
01:16:16,708 --> 01:16:17,541
Me?

1214
01:16:19,208 --> 01:16:20,666
You were the one with Max.

1215
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:22,458
Where is he?

1216
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:27,333
And what the hell's the candy
got to do with it?

1217
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,250
Could be it's softening your brain,
Uncle.

1218
01:16:29,333 --> 01:16:31,375
It's for the sugar. You know that.

1219
01:16:31,458 --> 01:16:32,958
Since I got off that stuff.

1220
01:16:33,916 --> 01:16:37,041
-And speaking of which...
-[gulps]

1221
01:16:37,583 --> 01:16:39,708
Speaking of which, here's little Mavis,

1222
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:42,000
who'll bring us
a little fresh encouragement,

1223
01:16:42,083 --> 01:16:43,875
um, won't you, sweetie?

1224
01:16:43,958 --> 01:16:46,166
-[Mavis] Shouldn't I go home and pack?
-Pack?

1225
01:16:46,333 --> 01:16:48,083
I mean, if we're going to Mexico.

1226
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:50,500
Oh, we go as we are, sweetie.

1227
01:16:50,833 --> 01:16:52,375
Just as we are.

1228
01:16:54,625 --> 01:16:56,625
[both chuckle]

1229
01:17:01,375 --> 01:17:02,833
Wasn't very smart, you know.

1230
01:17:03,583 --> 01:17:05,500
Poor-mouthing like that
in front of Otterlake.

1231
01:17:05,583 --> 01:17:08,791
-You know who he is, don't you?
-Of course I do.

1232
01:17:08,875 --> 01:17:10,083
I've seen his pictures.

1233
01:17:10,166 --> 01:17:11,333
He's a big success.

1234
01:17:11,416 --> 01:17:14,041
[man 6] Brooks Otterlake is money,
not just success, but money.

1235
01:17:14,125 --> 01:17:16,333
His old man owns half the trees in Canada.

1236
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:20,375
Yes, and you know what Billy told him.
He told him we're in trouble.

1237
01:17:20,791 --> 01:17:21,625
Well, aren't we?

1238
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,500
When you talk poor to the rich,
they jump to conclusions.

1239
01:17:25,583 --> 01:17:28,125
They think we're getting ready
for the touch.

1240
01:17:28,208 --> 01:17:29,666
And that's what we're doing?

1241
01:17:30,708 --> 01:17:34,208
Could have been the general idea
until Uncle Billy loused it up.

1242
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,166
But, Mr. Hannaford, excuse me...

1243
01:17:39,541 --> 01:17:41,958
Didn't I just hear you saying
about Otterlake...?

1244
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:45,041
-[man 6] No more questions, Junior.
-Where did this yo-yo come from?

1245
01:17:45,125 --> 01:17:48,083
[Pister] As it happens, I did one
of the first positive, critical appraisals

1246
01:17:48,166 --> 01:17:51,166
-of Brooks Otterlake.
-Oh, hooray for you, buddy boy.

1247
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:53,291
I just wanna be helpful.
From what I overheard,

1248
01:17:53,375 --> 01:17:55,166
I understand there's thought
of approaching him.

1249
01:17:55,333 --> 01:17:59,000
A word from me certainly couldn't hurt.
He's bound to feel some gratitude--

1250
01:17:59,083 --> 01:18:03,333
Mr. Otterlake's a chum.
We don't hustle our chums for dough.

1251
01:18:03,416 --> 01:18:05,083
We're kind of strict about that.

1252
01:18:05,416 --> 01:18:08,500
Always remember
that your heart is God's little garden.

1253
01:18:10,125 --> 01:18:11,625
[Matt] Is that recorder still running?

1254
01:18:11,708 --> 01:18:13,333
-No.
-Well, see that it isn't.

1255
01:18:13,458 --> 01:18:15,291
[Pister] There's a camera somewhere.

1256
01:18:15,375 --> 01:18:16,916
-[cameras rolling]
-A couple of them.

1257
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:24,916
Studying a man like Jake Hannaford,
that's an experience.

1258
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,500
Don't you miss it. Stick with the job.

1259
01:18:32,916 --> 01:18:35,125
Eat a little shit, Mr. Pister.

1260
01:18:38,666 --> 01:18:41,458
-[door slams]
-[guests chattering]

1261
01:18:42,458 --> 01:18:43,291
[Billy] Have fun.

1262
01:18:43,375 --> 01:18:45,708
-[Baron] What's that, Billy?
-That's the latest message.

1263
01:18:45,791 --> 01:18:46,750
Roger.

1264
01:18:46,833 --> 01:18:49,000
I did something I shouldn't have done.

1265
01:18:49,916 --> 01:18:51,916
[guests laughing]

1266
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:03,583
-But I saw him go into the library.
-Well, it's groovier in here.

1267
01:19:08,541 --> 01:19:10,500
[man 6] Billy? What are you doing?

1268
01:19:12,708 --> 01:19:13,541
[man 7] Otterlake.

1269
01:19:13,625 --> 01:19:16,041
-For Chrissake, Brooksie.
-[Otterlake] What?

1270
01:19:16,125 --> 01:19:17,875
You know about Billy.

1271
01:19:18,250 --> 01:19:21,000
He's been on the program for nine years.

1272
01:19:21,083 --> 01:19:23,250
-What you wanna do that for?
-What is the fundamental

1273
01:19:23,333 --> 01:19:26,000
aesthetic distinction
between a zoom and a dolly?

1274
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:31,416
What possible difference can that make
except to another dolly?

1275
01:19:34,041 --> 01:19:35,500
-Ah, forget it.
-What?

1276
01:19:38,125 --> 01:19:38,958
Hi.

1277
01:19:43,125 --> 01:19:45,125
[both laughing]

1278
01:19:47,708 --> 01:19:49,875
This is the one that hurts, Brooksie.

1279
01:19:52,541 --> 01:19:53,583
[Otterlake] Skipper...

1280
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:57,375
This is a scene
we both hoped we'd never get to.

1281
01:19:58,666 --> 01:20:02,500
I don't think it's gonna play,
not even for comedy.

1282
01:20:06,791 --> 01:20:09,541
Uh, how much do you need?

1283
01:20:11,875 --> 01:20:13,166
How much have you got?

1284
01:20:15,791 --> 01:20:20,291
Hey, remember when you first appeared
on that location of mine out in Iran?

1285
01:20:20,541 --> 01:20:24,250
[Otterlake] Yeah, I didn't even have
fare back home. Just that...

1286
01:20:25,250 --> 01:20:26,708
secondhand tape recorder.

1287
01:20:26,791 --> 01:20:28,250
A raggedy-ass kid.

1288
01:20:28,833 --> 01:20:29,708
When was it?

1289
01:20:30,333 --> 01:20:32,458
Only... uh, four years ago.

1290
01:20:32,916 --> 01:20:35,458
-[Otterlake] Skipper?
-Yes?

1291
01:20:36,458 --> 01:20:39,541
[Otterlake] That... 40 million that was...

1292
01:20:40,458 --> 01:20:41,333
mentioned...

1293
01:20:43,125 --> 01:20:44,208
[sighs]

1294
01:20:46,208 --> 01:20:47,333
I know, kid.

1295
01:20:49,958 --> 01:20:53,666
It's only a distant hope.
How's that for dialogue?

1296
01:20:56,750 --> 01:21:00,625
[Jake] Tell you what, Brooksie...
You might just lean a little on...

1297
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:02,291
-[water running]
-...Max David.

1298
01:21:02,708 --> 01:21:04,000
You do the leaning,

1299
01:21:04,666 --> 01:21:05,833
he's got to give.

1300
01:21:06,708 --> 01:21:09,583
-I did set up the screening.
-[Jake] So you did, Brooksie.

1301
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:12,166
And he hated every frame.

1302
01:21:12,291 --> 01:21:14,375
He's an idiot, Jake. They're all idiots.

1303
01:21:14,458 --> 01:21:15,583
You know that.

1304
01:21:15,666 --> 01:21:16,750
He's your idiot.

1305
01:21:16,833 --> 01:21:18,166
[Otterlake] Up to a point.

1306
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:23,666
Don't be pompous, Brooksie.
You made his company all that loot.

1307
01:21:24,541 --> 01:21:25,833
Christ knows I didn't.

1308
01:21:25,916 --> 01:21:28,375
Oh, don't think I'm not ready
to put up a fight for you.

1309
01:21:28,875 --> 01:21:32,291
-Want me to spare you the embarrassment?
-It's you I'm thinking of.

1310
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:35,041
God, I don't want to have to listen
to Max David...

1311
01:21:35,583 --> 01:21:36,833
and all those stupid...

1312
01:21:38,375 --> 01:21:39,375
Turning you down.

1313
01:21:41,041 --> 01:21:43,625
Don't give up the ship, eh, Brooksie?

1314
01:21:43,791 --> 01:21:45,375
-I'm not.
-[door opens]

1315
01:21:49,791 --> 01:21:51,916
[Jake] I told you this wouldn't play.

1316
01:21:55,166 --> 01:21:56,916
[Pat] You all right, Zimmie?

1317
01:21:57,833 --> 01:21:58,958
Oh, sure.

1318
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,833
Don't worry about me.
You've got troubles of your own.

1319
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,333
[Pat] Jesus, all this TV.

1320
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:07,208
There must be plenty of work
for a good makeup man.

1321
01:22:07,375 --> 01:22:08,583
I got a suggestion.

1322
01:22:08,916 --> 01:22:09,750
[Pat] Yeah?

1323
01:22:09,833 --> 01:22:13,708
-It's what you can do with them dummies.
-I know what I can do with them.

1324
01:22:14,041 --> 01:22:16,708
Listen, Pat.
You take them dummies, see,

1325
01:22:16,958 --> 01:22:19,041
and you take this piece of iron pipe,

1326
01:22:19,625 --> 01:22:22,583
and you slash and beat and chop away

1327
01:22:22,666 --> 01:22:24,083
to your heart's content.

1328
01:22:25,833 --> 01:22:27,583
Or maybe give the pop to Jake.

1329
01:22:28,916 --> 01:22:31,708
He'd feel a whole lot better off
afterwards, believe me.

1330
01:22:32,416 --> 01:22:36,833
-The state requires you...? [mumbles]
-Well, yes, every state does.

1331
01:22:36,958 --> 01:22:39,416
-Is that so?
-So, in order to graduate by January,

1332
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:41,791
I'd have to take
one correspondence course.

1333
01:22:42,375 --> 01:22:43,708
[Billy] Mr. Hannaford...

1334
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:46,708
[Jake] You have two more credits to go
before...?

1335
01:22:46,791 --> 01:22:48,916
-[Billy] Mr. Hannaford.
-[Mavis speaking indistinctly]

1336
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,041
-She doesn't want to pay that?
-She won't sign for it.

1337
01:22:51,125 --> 01:22:52,083
Mr. Hannaford?

1338
01:22:54,083 --> 01:22:56,708
Dr. Bradley Pierce Burroughs.

1339
01:22:57,041 --> 01:22:57,958
Pease.

1340
01:22:59,041 --> 01:23:02,291
-Pease?
-Bradley Pease Burroughs.

1341
01:23:05,833 --> 01:23:08,416
Not that it matters.
[chuckles] How do you, sir?

1342
01:23:09,875 --> 01:23:12,291
-Here you go. May I take your...?
-Oh.

1343
01:23:12,375 --> 01:23:13,708
Oh, yes. Thank you.

1344
01:23:17,166 --> 01:23:18,375
[camera rolling]

1345
01:23:26,083 --> 01:23:28,333
[man 6] The doc here is professor
of English Literature.

1346
01:23:28,416 --> 01:23:32,625
at the Frannahan Boarding Academy
for boys.

1347
01:23:33,166 --> 01:23:34,000
Clivedale.

1348
01:23:38,333 --> 01:23:42,333
-That's the name of the school.
-He also teaches Dramatics.

1349
01:23:44,666 --> 01:23:47,375
And who do you think was my star pupil?

1350
01:23:47,875 --> 01:23:50,208
Of course, we knew him then as Oscar.

1351
01:23:51,625 --> 01:23:53,083
[chuckles]

1352
01:23:53,666 --> 01:23:54,750
Oscar.

1353
01:23:55,333 --> 01:23:58,458
[man 6] Uh, tell about Aunt Daisy
with the funny hats.

1354
01:23:59,583 --> 01:24:00,666
Well, uh...

1355
01:24:01,166 --> 01:24:04,333
-They weren't... that funny.
-[man 6] She raised him, so you said.

1356
01:24:04,833 --> 01:24:09,041
And... from the time he was first able
to walk, he used to put on shows.

1357
01:24:09,333 --> 01:24:12,875
You know, with his auntie's hats
and gowns and dresses.

1358
01:24:13,833 --> 01:24:16,916
[whispers] The way Dale tells it,
he didn't even want to be an actor.

1359
01:24:17,291 --> 01:24:20,916
Supposedly Jake's idea.
He practically forced him into it.

1360
01:24:21,041 --> 01:24:22,000
[Otterlake] Huh.

1361
01:24:22,083 --> 01:24:24,333
[Jake] What was he doing, um...

1362
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:27,583
in Acapulco, besides getting stoned?

1363
01:24:29,458 --> 01:24:31,333
He made the trip just to see you.

1364
01:24:36,166 --> 01:24:37,416
[chuckles]

1365
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:42,958
[both laughing]

1366
01:24:48,166 --> 01:24:51,916
-[Otterlake] Does all this matter?
-[whispers] I think it does to Jake.

1367
01:24:52,708 --> 01:24:56,666
Oh, Christ. [laughs]

1368
01:24:57,833 --> 01:24:58,875
[coughs]

1369
01:25:00,083 --> 01:25:02,958
Um... And the change of name?

1370
01:25:03,250 --> 01:25:04,250
Oh, for that...

1371
01:25:04,750 --> 01:25:06,791
I'm afraid we have to blame Oscar Wilde.

1372
01:25:13,583 --> 01:25:14,416
But...

1373
01:25:14,916 --> 01:25:15,750
we had this...

1374
01:25:16,625 --> 01:25:17,458
Yeah?

1375
01:25:18,166 --> 01:25:21,625
There was, uh, an unpleasant little...
[mutters]

1376
01:25:26,791 --> 01:25:28,333
You see, there was this, um...

1377
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:30,875
We had this teacher.

1378
01:25:32,375 --> 01:25:35,125
-He was just one of those little...
-You mean he was a faggot.

1379
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,083
This teacher was a faggot.

1380
01:25:40,208 --> 01:25:41,041
Well...

1381
01:25:49,166 --> 01:25:51,375
Uh, Mr. Hannaford...

1382
01:25:57,916 --> 01:26:00,291
This story concerns my school.

1383
01:26:00,875 --> 01:26:04,083
I-- I'm in no position to, uh...

1384
01:26:05,208 --> 01:26:07,500
-publish--
-Publish and be damned.

1385
01:26:08,083 --> 01:26:10,833
Look. We've run out of film.

1386
01:26:11,916 --> 01:26:13,708
You can, uh, speak off the record.

1387
01:26:15,333 --> 01:26:18,166
Dale was in no way involved, you know,

1388
01:26:18,666 --> 01:26:21,500
but... among the boys... there was a...

1389
01:26:22,083 --> 01:26:25,708
great deal of morbid conversation, um...

1390
01:26:25,791 --> 01:26:27,916
I'm afraid, on unhealthy subjects.

1391
01:26:30,083 --> 01:26:33,875
As you could imagine,
with a name like Oscar...

1392
01:26:35,083 --> 01:26:36,708
What happened to that teacher?

1393
01:26:37,583 --> 01:26:39,625
-We let him go, of course.
-Let him go?

1394
01:26:39,708 --> 01:26:41,791
-Mm-hmm.
-What about the police?

1395
01:26:42,375 --> 01:26:46,041
Well, the man was sick, Mr. Hannaford.

1396
01:26:46,125 --> 01:26:47,750
But those young boys.

1397
01:26:47,833 --> 01:26:50,458
They must have been sick
after he finished with them.

1398
01:26:50,541 --> 01:26:52,958
Uh, I hope you're not worried about Dale.

1399
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:55,666
You think I should be?

1400
01:26:56,583 --> 01:27:00,458
Wouldn't that depend, Mr. Hannaford,
on your own... personal interest?

1401
01:27:05,791 --> 01:27:08,041
[shouts]
What are you driving at, Dr. Burroughs?

1402
01:27:08,125 --> 01:27:08,958
Nothing.

1403
01:27:14,958 --> 01:27:15,833
Nothing.

1404
01:27:16,333 --> 01:27:17,166
No, no, no!

1405
01:27:19,125 --> 01:27:21,958
I'm just his director, not his Aunt Daisy.

1406
01:27:22,333 --> 01:27:23,750
And I'm just his English teacher.

1407
01:27:27,666 --> 01:27:30,625
[both laugh]

1408
01:27:32,833 --> 01:27:35,041
Certainly, he has every reason
to be grateful to you.

1409
01:27:35,125 --> 01:27:38,041
I'm sure that one day,
when one of his fine performances

1410
01:27:38,125 --> 01:27:40,708
gets the Academy Award,
you'll be grateful to him.

1411
01:27:41,416 --> 01:27:44,500
Notice how careful he is not to refer
to it as an Oscar.

1412
01:27:50,958 --> 01:27:53,375
Would you like to take a dip,
Dr. Burroughs?

1413
01:27:53,708 --> 01:27:54,625
A dip?

1414
01:27:55,791 --> 01:27:59,375
Oh, the pool! What a grand suggestion.
[laughs]

1415
01:28:00,458 --> 01:28:03,583
A little more hooch would be helpful.
I'll be right with you.

1416
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:05,666
Good. Good.

1417
01:28:16,166 --> 01:28:18,458
-Where do I change?
-Right here.

1418
01:28:19,166 --> 01:28:20,375
In the sight of God.

1419
01:28:24,625 --> 01:28:26,541
We all promise not to look, hmm?

1420
01:28:29,708 --> 01:28:31,708
[all laughing]

1421
01:28:34,458 --> 01:28:37,875
Yes, I suppose
all schoolteachers are prigs.

1422
01:28:38,333 --> 01:28:39,500
I suppose...

1423
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:42,125
Prigs or... faggots.

1424
01:28:42,458 --> 01:28:46,791
-Now, now, Mr. Hannaford.
-Now, now, Dr. Burroughs!

1425
01:28:46,958 --> 01:28:48,250
[chuckles]

1426
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:50,750
[chuckles nervously]

1427
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,250
We were conned, Mother.

1428
01:28:59,791 --> 01:29:00,750
He was a fake.

1429
01:29:01,416 --> 01:29:03,041
[Billy] She knows the way they met.

1430
01:29:03,125 --> 01:29:06,041
When Mr. John Dale was pulled
out of the water,

1431
01:29:06,125 --> 01:29:08,125
the famous would-be suicide.

1432
01:29:08,208 --> 01:29:09,541
"Would-be suicide"?

1433
01:29:09,916 --> 01:29:12,333
I'm bored with the whole story. [sighs]

1434
01:29:12,708 --> 01:29:16,000
Would-be suicides
ought to be treated like drunks.

1435
01:29:18,625 --> 01:29:20,541
Turns out he doesn't belong to you.

1436
01:29:20,625 --> 01:29:21,583
[Maggie] "Belong"?

1437
01:29:21,666 --> 01:29:23,750
The old Chinese business, remember?

1438
01:29:25,041 --> 01:29:27,958
You save a life, you own that life.

1439
01:29:28,416 --> 01:29:30,916
-Finders keepers?
-[Maggie] Jake isn't a Chinaman.

1440
01:29:31,208 --> 01:29:32,958
And Dale wasn't no suicide.

1441
01:29:33,041 --> 01:29:34,541
No, he was an actor.

1442
01:29:34,625 --> 01:29:36,750
And he wasn't drowning,
he was auditioning.

1443
01:29:37,041 --> 01:29:39,500
Jake, that boy didn't run away.

1444
01:29:39,916 --> 01:29:41,125
He was <i>thrown </i>away.

1445
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:45,000
Yes, Mother. And sweet, Holy Jesus,
what a relief that was.

1446
01:29:45,083 --> 01:29:48,541
Like getting rid of an aching tooth
or the monkey off your back.

1447
01:29:49,333 --> 01:29:51,541
A drug habit's something
you've gotta kick.

1448
01:29:51,625 --> 01:29:53,750
[Jake] Yes, and my foot was getting sore.

1449
01:29:54,875 --> 01:29:56,625
[sighs] How are you going to finish it?

1450
01:29:56,708 --> 01:29:59,625
That boy is all washed up, Ms. Valeska.

1451
01:29:59,708 --> 01:30:01,708
The picture. Isn't that what matters?

1452
01:30:02,375 --> 01:30:06,875
Well, we've got that footage
of him bringing the clothes to her

1453
01:30:06,958 --> 01:30:09,083
and all that wind. Right, Maggie?

1454
01:30:09,250 --> 01:30:11,916
To the girl. What then?

1455
01:30:12,083 --> 01:30:14,208
The girl. What about her?

1456
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:15,958
Yes, what about her?

1457
01:30:16,291 --> 01:30:18,916
-We're all interested.
-Dale wasn't.

1458
01:30:19,625 --> 01:30:22,916
And neither is Mr. Hannaford.
That's funny, isn't it?

1459
01:30:23,750 --> 01:30:24,708
A scream.

1460
01:30:24,833 --> 01:30:26,666
I'd just like to ask Mr. Hannaford

1461
01:30:26,750 --> 01:30:29,833
if things wouldn't have been
very different if Dale had been her lover?

1462
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:34,458
If they weren't lovers,
doesn't that sort of spoil the pattern?

1463
01:30:35,416 --> 01:30:37,166
-Ms. Rich?
-[Billy] She's on again.

1464
01:30:38,250 --> 01:30:39,166
You ask him.

1465
01:30:44,416 --> 01:30:48,333
-Why don't you get lost?
-Tonight, it's all on the record.

1466
01:30:49,250 --> 01:30:52,166
It's all hanging out.
That's how Zarah wants it.

1467
01:30:52,250 --> 01:30:55,208
-[Pat] Here's a present for you.
-The truth shall set us free.

1468
01:30:55,291 --> 01:30:57,625
-Not from me, from Zimmie.
-Zimmie?

1469
01:30:57,958 --> 01:31:00,666
-There's a card with it.
-We ought to have a drink with Zimmie.

1470
01:31:00,791 --> 01:31:01,708
You fired him.

1471
01:31:02,458 --> 01:31:05,208
I always fire Zimmie.
I fire Zimmie constantly.

1472
01:31:05,708 --> 01:31:09,541
Anyway, it's my birthday.
I always give the presents.

1473
01:31:09,833 --> 01:31:12,250
-[Maggie] That's some kind of a gag.
-We know.

1474
01:31:13,083 --> 01:31:14,833
He makes the gags, too. Did he tell you where I should stick it?

1475
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,625
Oh, Zimmie's jokes.

1476
01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:24,833
[Pat] Just in case you want to use it
on those dummy John Dales he made for you.

1477
01:31:25,250 --> 01:31:28,958
Speaking of presents...
have I got a present!

1478
01:31:29,791 --> 01:31:34,083
"Have a go at the dummies, Jake.
They break even more easily than people.''

1479
01:31:41,375 --> 01:31:43,791
-[guests chattering and laughing]
-Gentlemen!

1480
01:31:43,958 --> 01:31:45,958
[cameras rolling]

1481
01:31:46,916 --> 01:31:47,916
Ladies.

1482
01:31:49,166 --> 01:31:50,875
We are presenting an award

1483
01:31:51,166 --> 01:31:54,125
to the other half
of <i>The Other Side of the Wind.</i>

1484
01:31:54,708 --> 01:31:56,458
The, um, better half.

1485
01:31:56,875 --> 01:31:58,125
A bone...

1486
01:31:58,791 --> 01:31:59,791
for Pocahontas.

1487
01:32:00,583 --> 01:32:03,166
A little curio we picked up somewhere.

1488
01:32:04,083 --> 01:32:07,833
A bit of our own pale-faced craftsmanship.

1489
01:32:08,791 --> 01:32:10,125
Indian bone.

1490
01:32:11,458 --> 01:32:16,125
The inscription goes back
to before all this was movie country.

1491
01:32:16,916 --> 01:32:19,666
Just after... gold was found,

1492
01:32:19,875 --> 01:32:22,333
the Indian population dropped
pretty quickly.

1493
01:32:22,708 --> 01:32:26,875
And in ten years, about 90,000 of them...

1494
01:32:26,958 --> 01:32:28,708
just, uh, disappeared.

1495
01:32:29,333 --> 01:32:34,833
Well, in those good old days,
our gallant honky pioneers

1496
01:32:35,041 --> 01:32:41,166
uh, used to cut off Indian ears
and pickle them in whiskey for souvenirs.

1497
01:32:42,166 --> 01:32:45,333
And on pieces of bone, like this,

1498
01:32:45,708 --> 01:32:48,541
they'd, um, write funny little jokes.

1499
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,500
"I am off the reservation...

1500
01:32:51,708 --> 01:32:53,000
at last."

1501
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:56,916
And so are you, my dear.

1502
01:32:58,125 --> 01:33:00,958
Perhaps you'd like to present this
to our leading man.

1503
01:33:01,875 --> 01:33:03,666
Right up his ass.

1504
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:06,333
[guests murmuring]

1505
01:33:10,666 --> 01:33:12,666
[male guest 12]
The old man is a destroyer.

1506
01:33:12,750 --> 01:33:15,083
What he creates, he has to wreck.
It's a compulsion.

1507
01:33:15,208 --> 01:33:18,458
Then, we must wait, my dear,
for him to eat us alive.

1508
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,250
Unless, perhaps, you are a critic.

1509
01:33:21,791 --> 01:33:24,500
He does rather tend to push them
to the side of his plate.

1510
01:33:25,791 --> 01:33:26,666
But others...

1511
01:33:27,625 --> 01:33:30,250
we who glow a little in his lights,

1512
01:33:31,083 --> 01:33:34,375
-the fireflies...
-Fireflies. I'll drink to that!

1513
01:33:34,458 --> 01:33:37,125
...he does quite often swallow whole.

1514
01:33:38,458 --> 01:33:39,583
It is a fact...

1515
01:33:40,333 --> 01:33:44,000
that some of us,
he chews on rather slowly.

1516
01:33:44,541 --> 01:33:47,125
[man 10]
And you wouldn't call him a destroyer?

1517
01:33:47,208 --> 01:33:48,625
[Baron] I withdraw the aphorism, and give you, in its place,

1518
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:52,416
a simple law of physics.

1519
01:33:54,125 --> 01:33:56,583
"No machine ever produces

1520
01:33:56,666 --> 01:33:59,041
as much as it consumes."

1521
01:33:59,333 --> 01:34:02,416
[Jake, on recording] <i>Everybody was happy</i>
<i>until they found him one Sunday morning</i>

1522
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:04,666
<i>in his suite in the old Hollywood Hotel,</i>

1523
01:34:05,291 --> 01:34:07,083
<i>hanging from a chandelier.</i>

1524
01:34:41,375 --> 01:34:42,625
[slurring] Early morning,

1525
01:34:43,875 --> 01:34:45,041
just before dawn.

1526
01:34:46,583 --> 01:34:47,666
Not yet.

1527
01:34:48,708 --> 01:34:50,125
Flashback, Mavis.

1528
01:34:51,250 --> 01:34:53,750
An old-fashioned flashback.

1529
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,166
We're out on the boat.

1530
01:34:57,208 --> 01:35:00,208
And we just happened
to notice somebody drowning.

1531
01:35:00,958 --> 01:35:04,208
Trying to.
A young punk nobody ever heard of.

1532
01:35:05,166 --> 01:35:06,125
John Dale.

1533
01:35:07,625 --> 01:35:09,000
They've heard of him now.

1534
01:35:09,583 --> 01:35:10,625

What?

1690
01:42:46,166 --> 01:42:47,666
[Otterlake]
<i>They're dropping over Burbank...</i>

1691
01:42:47,791 --> 01:42:51,125
[man 6]
Will the owner of the '74 blue Impala

1692
01:42:51,208 --> 01:42:53,208
please come down and move it?

1693
01:42:57,916 --> 01:43:00,541
I wonder if our leader has any idea
who that belongs to?

1694
01:43:01,458 --> 01:43:02,833
No, but he paid for it.

1695
01:43:02,958 --> 01:43:05,000
-What?
-It was supposed to be Dale's.

1696
01:43:05,125 --> 01:43:07,666
-Wow.
-We weren't giving him much of a salary.

1697
01:43:07,750 --> 01:43:10,208
He would have got that as a bonus
when he finished the picture.

1698
01:43:10,791 --> 01:43:12,458
He didn't, so he doesn't. Hmm?

1699
01:43:12,541 --> 01:43:13,708
[man in car] Whoo-hoo!

1700
01:43:14,750 --> 01:43:16,750
[Billy] <i>Now, here's a late bulletin...</i>

1701
01:43:17,083 --> 01:43:18,250
<i>Marlon Brando,</i>

1702
01:43:18,541 --> 01:43:21,208
<i>who, by the way folks, is not pregnant,</i>

1703
01:43:21,791 --> 01:43:25,875
<i>has gone underground</i>
<i>and is doing splendid work for all of us,</i>

1704
01:43:26,166 --> 01:43:28,708
<i>under the name of Tokyo Rose.</i>

1705
01:43:29,416 --> 01:43:31,875
Chin up, Brooksie!
They haven't got us yet.

1706
01:43:35,125 --> 01:43:38,083
Here's a lady tells us we've got to stick
together, Jake and I.

1707
01:43:38,208 --> 01:43:41,208
The farther you're apart,
the harder it will always be to hide.

1708
01:43:41,291 --> 01:43:44,875
-What would we be hiding, lady?
-How much you really hate each other.

1709
01:43:46,625 --> 01:43:48,208
You've got it slightly wrong.

1710
01:43:49,083 --> 01:43:49,916
Yes?

1711
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:52,500
[footsteps fading] [upbeat music playing]

1712
01:44:04,625 --> 01:44:06,625
[guests chattering]

1713
01:44:08,916 --> 01:44:10,791
[young woman] We made it.
We're over on the left.

1714
01:44:12,291 --> 01:44:14,125
[man] There's a spot over here.

1715
01:44:18,875 --> 01:44:20,416
[camera rolling]

1716
01:44:23,166 --> 01:44:24,833
[Baron] Hot coffee? Over here.

1717
01:44:27,125 --> 01:44:28,958
[waiter] I'd say another case.

1718
01:44:29,708 --> 01:44:31,208
[Otterlake] Black coffee.

1719
01:44:32,583 --> 01:44:34,583
I hope Jake's one of your customers.

1720
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,000
That's the idea.

1721
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:38,833
Of course.

1722
01:44:40,625 --> 01:44:44,250
I wouldn't give much for the rest of them.
But he... Lucky he's got you, Baron.

1723
01:44:44,666 --> 01:44:46,291
Oh, he'll get along without me.

1724
01:44:48,833 --> 01:44:49,833
What does that mean?

1725
01:44:50,083 --> 01:44:53,041
[Baron] There's a time for all things
under the sun, Mr. Otterlake.

1726
01:44:53,583 --> 01:44:55,666
I'm getting much too old for my job.

1727
01:44:56,291 --> 01:44:57,500
If you can call it that.

1728
01:44:58,208 --> 01:44:59,166
Nonsense.

1729
01:44:59,375 --> 01:45:01,625
What I wouldn't give
for somebody like you.

1730
01:45:01,875 --> 01:45:03,250
I'm not on the market.

1731
01:45:04,208 --> 01:45:05,333
You never were.

1732
01:45:05,916 --> 01:45:08,708
Even for the neutral observer,
there is a price.

1733
01:45:09,708 --> 01:45:11,166
Not worth it for you, though.

1734
01:45:11,750 --> 01:45:13,750
You're not quite tough enough for that.

1735
01:45:14,291 --> 01:45:15,125
Not yet.

1736
01:45:16,625 --> 01:45:19,166
But who knows, Mr. Otterlake?
Perhaps you will be.

1737
01:45:19,333 --> 01:45:20,500
[sighs]

1738
01:45:20,625 --> 01:45:23,375
And where will that put me, Baron,
in your estimation?

1739
01:45:23,958 --> 01:45:25,166
Where do you want to be?

1740
01:45:26,958 --> 01:45:29,250
No, what you need, now and always...

1741
01:45:29,500 --> 01:45:30,666
are the soldiers,

1742
01:45:31,375 --> 01:45:32,708
the good soldiers. Men like Billy.

1743
01:45:36,708 --> 01:45:39,000
They followed Hannibal and Napoleon,

1744
01:45:40,125 --> 01:45:41,666
they really crossed the Alps.

1745
01:45:43,208 --> 01:45:45,500
They are the heroes in any story.

1746
01:45:48,208 --> 01:45:49,541
Is there a movie in it?

1747
01:45:51,666 --> 01:45:52,833
[chuckles]

1748
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
[jazz playing]

1749
01:46:06,416 --> 01:46:09,500
[wind blowing loudly]

1750
01:46:35,666 --> 01:46:37,125
[projector whirring]

1751
01:46:37,208 --> 01:46:40,208
[Baron] Excuse me.
I'm afraid we're getting out of sequence.

1752
01:46:40,750 --> 01:46:42,458
Someone must have given you
the wrong reel.

1753
01:46:42,541 --> 01:46:44,375
[projectionist] Does it matter?

1754
01:46:48,333 --> 01:46:51,333
[Baron] Maggie ought to be here,
keeping the reels in order.

1755
01:46:51,875 --> 01:46:53,000
[projectionist] Who?

1756
01:46:54,791 --> 01:46:57,500
-She's the film editor.
-[projectionist] I haven't seen her.

1757
01:46:59,500 --> 01:47:00,333
Well...

1758
01:47:06,583 --> 01:47:07,625
Well...

1759
01:47:09,125 --> 01:47:10,375
You're right, I suppose.

1760
01:47:11,750 --> 01:47:13,125
It doesn't matter at all.

1761
01:47:17,875 --> 01:47:20,333
"But this rough magic he here abjures.

1762
01:47:21,083 --> 01:47:22,958
Take back that last, it doesn't fit."

1763
01:47:24,208 --> 01:47:26,000
[Jake] What does "abjure" mean?

1764
01:47:26,958 --> 01:47:29,083
-You went to Harvard.
-Give up.

1765
01:47:31,375 --> 01:47:32,541
Is that a suggestion?

1766
01:47:33,541 --> 01:47:35,458
"Abjure," he knows what it means.

1767
01:47:36,250 --> 01:47:38,750
I gave up in the seventh grade.

1768
01:47:39,541 --> 01:47:40,500
How about you?

1769
01:47:44,125 --> 01:47:44,958
Never.

1770
01:47:46,083 --> 01:47:47,083
Not even now.

1771
01:47:51,458 --> 01:47:53,708
And I didn't learn my Shakespeare
at Harvard.

1772
01:47:54,625 --> 01:47:56,500
Mr. Otterfield here...

1773
01:47:57,208 --> 01:47:58,541
wanted to be an actor,

1774
01:47:58,625 --> 01:48:00,458
then he saw one of my films.

1775
01:48:00,708 --> 01:48:02,500
We all read the interview.

1776
01:48:03,791 --> 01:48:05,791
He is a rough magician, isn't he?

1777
01:48:08,125 --> 01:48:09,750
You can kiss my sweet ass.

1778
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:12,583
What did I do wrong, Daddy?

1779
01:48:17,958 --> 01:48:18,916
"Our revels...

1780
01:48:20,208 --> 01:48:21,291
now are ended."

1781
01:48:23,625 --> 01:48:25,083
You bet your sweet cheeks.

1782
01:48:32,333 --> 01:48:33,833
[Baron] I thought<i> </i>you had left.

1783
01:48:33,916 --> 01:48:36,041
We had to hire this drive-in
for the whole night.

1784
01:48:36,125 --> 01:48:38,666
Somebody had to make the arrangements,
didn't they?

1785
01:48:38,791 --> 01:48:40,416
It's on the way back to town.

1786
01:48:40,791 --> 01:48:43,333
-Monday, I'll have an office at Universal.
-[engine starts]

1787
01:48:43,416 --> 01:48:44,416
Give me a ring.

1788
01:48:44,916 --> 01:48:46,708
-This station wagon.
-What about it?

1789
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,125
It belongs to Jake.

1790
01:48:48,833 --> 01:48:51,000
Where shall I pick it up? At Universal?

1791
01:48:51,166 --> 01:48:52,708
It goes back to the dealer.

1792
01:48:53,375 --> 01:48:54,208
Yes.

1793
01:48:54,916 --> 01:48:58,291
[Baron] Like the sports car, I suppose.
The one Jake is driving.

1794
01:48:58,375 --> 01:49:02,166
[Matt] Oh, that one's paid for.
That was gonna be a present, remember?

1795
01:49:02,875 --> 01:49:03,916
For John Dale.

1796
01:49:04,416 --> 01:49:05,875
When he finished the picture.

1797
01:49:10,458 --> 01:49:12,958
Wait a minute. Wait a minute!

1798
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,208
What's with Billy?

1799
01:49:16,291 --> 01:49:17,875
He ran out of gumdrops.

1800
01:49:18,666 --> 01:49:20,666
[engine roars] [grunts]

1801
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:31,000
[sighs]

1802
01:49:44,291 --> 01:49:45,541
Going, so soon, honey?

1803
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:47,333
Yes.

1804
01:49:47,708 --> 01:49:49,416
Wasn't much fun for you, was it?

1805
01:49:50,125 --> 01:49:50,958
Goddamn midgets.

1806
01:49:51,750 --> 01:49:52,625
Friends of yours?

1807
01:49:53,250 --> 01:49:57,291
[Otterlake] So sorry, Zarah.
I'm afraid our leader's a little pissed.

1808
01:49:57,625 --> 01:50:00,541
She doesn't like you, kid.
That's why she gave the party.

1809
01:50:00,625 --> 01:50:03,375
She figures I don't relate enough
to the younger generation.

1810
01:50:04,083 --> 01:50:05,333
Just through you.

1811
01:50:05,583 --> 01:50:06,541
But I do, you know.

1812
01:50:06,958 --> 01:50:08,541
I relate all I need to relate.

1813
01:50:19,583 --> 01:50:20,458
Hey, beautiful.

1814
01:50:20,583 --> 01:50:24,833
Couldn't we fix it to see each other
just a little bit less seldom?

1815
01:50:26,041 --> 01:50:27,250
With an old friend...

1816
01:50:28,583 --> 01:50:30,416
It's quite enough to know he's there.

1817
01:50:31,916 --> 01:50:34,125
Like Gibraltar, the Eiffel Tower...

1818
01:50:35,916 --> 01:50:36,875
Durability.

1819
01:50:38,458 --> 01:50:39,750
It can be rather fragile.

1820
01:50:41,875 --> 01:50:44,416
Sometimes, to keep that feeling,

1821
01:50:45,166 --> 01:50:47,041
we need to keep our distance.

1822
01:50:48,791 --> 01:50:51,875
The bad thing is to find out
that a friendship was

1823
01:50:51,958 --> 01:50:53,625
between a couple of other people.

1824
01:50:55,291 --> 01:50:56,375
Thanks, Mother.

1825
01:50:57,583 --> 01:50:59,333
[chanting over speakers]

1826
01:50:59,458 --> 01:51:02,375
You hear that?
 That's old Manolito, remember?

1827
01:51:13,708 --> 01:51:16,166
We found him together. In Spain.

1828
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:20,791
-[Rich] Where is he now?
-Back there, with our hostess,

1829
01:51:21,333 --> 01:51:22,208
by the limo.

1830
01:51:22,375 --> 01:51:25,291
-[Rich] Valeska. Is she leaving?
-[guest] Looks that way.

1831
01:51:26,916 --> 01:51:29,416
Well, she'll have to answer
a few questions first.

1832
01:51:34,625 --> 01:51:36,541
Say goodnight for me to your actress.

1833
01:51:37,166 --> 01:51:39,291
She was pretty good in there
with that gun.

1834
01:51:39,375 --> 01:51:40,916
[Rich] She wasn't shooting at dummies.

1835
01:51:42,833 --> 01:51:45,708
The preferred target, I suppose,
 would have been me.

1836
01:51:46,541 --> 01:51:49,500
Preferred by whom, Mr. Hannaford?
You gave her the gun.

1837
01:51:49,833 --> 01:51:53,166
Now, what does that mean?
What's it supposed to mean?

1838
01:51:53,583 --> 01:51:57,333
Don't worry.
Even if she doesn't know, she'll tell us.

1839
01:51:58,166 --> 01:51:59,375
[Rich] Ms. Valeska,

1840
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,416
you made just one film
with Mr. Hannaford.

1841
01:52:02,625 --> 01:52:03,541
Yes.

1842
01:52:03,625 --> 01:52:05,916
That Garvey...
Glen Garvey was your leading man.

1843
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,958
It is true, isn't it,
that during the shooting of that film,

1844
01:52:09,041 --> 01:52:11,375
Mr. Hannaford had an affair
with Garvey's wife?

1845
01:52:12,375 --> 01:52:16,375
Men are the subject of his films.
And whoever the man is,

1846
01:52:16,458 --> 01:52:18,416
naturally, he's got a girl, right?

1847
01:52:18,666 --> 01:52:23,083
And whoever she is, somehow,
finally, Hannaford seduces her.

1848
01:52:24,250 --> 01:52:26,125
He must. He has to possess her,

1849
01:52:26,208 --> 01:52:28,416
because it's the only way
that he can possess him.

1850
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:30,000
We'll have to stop this, you know?

1851
01:52:30,708 --> 01:52:32,666
[Billy shouts]
Okay, okay, cut it, you guys.

1852
01:52:32,791 --> 01:52:36,500
Expensive vice, isn't it?
After he's had his actor's girl,

1853
01:52:36,583 --> 01:52:37,541
he throws her away.

1854
01:52:37,625 --> 01:52:40,583
And then he's thrown his actor away,
and destroyed him in the process.

1855
01:52:41,333 --> 01:52:43,041
Maybe that's what you really want.

1856
01:52:43,125 --> 01:52:45,125
[Rich gasps]

[shouting] You son of a bitch,
you belong in a B-movie!

1859
01:52:50,916 --> 01:52:53,166
Pick on someone your own size,
motherfucker.

1860
01:52:53,250 --> 01:52:56,333
-[cameras clicking]
-I'm all right. Would you let go of me?

1861
01:52:56,541 --> 01:52:58,416
[Billy] All right! Go home!

1862
01:52:58,541 --> 01:53:00,583
[Otterlake] They're getting all this
on film, you know?

1863
01:53:00,666 --> 01:53:02,208
Who gives a shit?

[shouting]
Where's your public, for Chrissake?

1866
01:53:06,583 --> 01:53:09,958
Before any of you creeps
could put this stuff together,

1867
01:53:10,041 --> 01:53:11,583
we'll have our own movie!

1868
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:13,833
A real movie!

1869
01:53:18,166 --> 01:53:19,750
[horn honks]

1870
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:21,875
[Otterlake]
What happened to the critic lady?

1871
01:53:21,958 --> 01:53:23,083
She'll live.

1872
01:53:23,875 --> 01:53:25,708
Yeah, she'll live to write about it.

1873
01:53:29,625 --> 01:53:32,375
-[Billy] Don't let him get you down.
-Do you?

1874
01:53:33,291 --> 01:53:34,208
Not  yet.

1875

[Jake, on recording]<i> Remember</i>

1877

<i>They wouldn't let us</i>

1878
01:54:00,625 --> 01:54:02,833

So...

1884
01:54:34,208 --> 01:54:35,958
you came to my party after all.

1885

Get in, I'll drive you.
