1
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:48,527
All controls are go. All power is go.

2
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,733
Switch controls. Prepare to launch.

3
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:54,406
Control to pilot.

4
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,667
Checklist complete for test flight.

5
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,872
Stand by for power.

6
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:05,178
Force field established. it's all yours.

7
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:08,712
If this works, the planets are next door...

8
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:11,483
and the universe is just around the corner.

9
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,124
Vince, what is it?

10
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,887
- It's jammed.
- What?

11
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:23,486
Everything is jammed!

12
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:53,752
One of the main reasons
for this refresher course...

13
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,754
is to keep you up to date
on the latest methods and weapons.

14
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:00,190
This little gadget here
dissolves metal electronically.

15
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:03,991
Easy to conceal,
extremely effective in times of danger.

16
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,899
- That's when the danger usually starts.
- I like my way better.

17
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:21,238
Now if you ladies will follow me over here.

18
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:29,784
Lucky Linda!

19
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:34,019
Yes, imagine,
working on a field problem with him.

20
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,874
How do you like that?
I didn't even get to squeeze the trigger.

21
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:57,917
When you say you're a 38,
you ain't just kidding.

22
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:00,112
It's not a gun, Mr. Helm.

23
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:03,780
It's a new weapon they gave me,
developed right here in our lab.

24
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,326
- And developed pretty well, too.
- Here, I'll show you.

25
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,429
If you'll turn around.

26
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,464
Are you aiming or just being modest?

27
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:20,072
I'm sorry I tricked you, Mr. Helm,
but may I point out...

28
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,732
You already did.

29
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,242
That's why you're here:

30
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:26,074
to become familiar
with our latest equipment.

31
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:30,173
You're right. An agent should always
keep abreast of the times.

32
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:33,983
You see, it's sewn right into the stays.

33
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:37,147
A retractable gun barrel. Fires on contact.

34
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,584
That's some kind of crazy holster.

35
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,787
I guess the lesson's over with for today.

36
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,427
- Now, where were we?
- No, you don't.

37
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,698
Those things come in pairs.

38
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,769
- That's him.
- Really?

39
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,312
Matt Helm.

40
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:04,640
Don't shoot.

41
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:10,015
Help me! Help!

42
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,454
- Whoa, honey.
- He's trying to kill me.

43
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,357
- It's all right, Sheila.
- Sheila?

44
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,758
- Please.
- Sheila Sommers?

45
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:20,322
- Do you know her?
- Yeah, we worked an assignment together.

46
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,834
Don't you remember me? Matt Helm.

47
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:25,529
Come along, Sheila. Everything's all right.

48
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,037
Attagirl.

49
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,205
She thinks every man is trying to kill her.

50
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,549
When I knew her, she'd
kill them right back.

51
00:08:33,574 --> 00:08:34,668
What's the story?

52
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:36,045
That's what we'd like to know.

53
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:38,640
She stumbled out of the jungle
a few weeks ago.

54
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:42,621
Beat up pretty bad. In deep shock.
Can't remember anything.

55
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,483
She's going to be here a long time.

56
00:08:57,069 --> 00:09:00,471
Long-distance call for you, Mr. Helm.
Hop aboard.

57
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:07,570
I go pretty fast.
Better find something to hang on to.

58
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:10,210
Crazy.

59
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:14,483
- When am I getting out of here?
- You're not.

60
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,222
Come on, Mac.
I don't need a refresher course.

61
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:22,352
Every girl here is built like
the Aberdeen Proving Grounds.

62
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:26,189
You're not there for a refresher course.
Not anymore.

63
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,331
Matt, do you remember a girl
named Sheila Sommers?

64
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,064
Yeah, I just bumped into,
well, what's left of her.

65
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:33,332
What about her?

66
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,740
I don't want to discuss it now.
Your secretary's on the way.

67
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:40,039
- You'll find out a few things from her.
- You told Lovey?

68
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:44,606
Well, no, not exactly.
But you'll get the message.

69
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:55,087
Mr. Helm, it's time for
your fencing lesson.

70
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:59,591
Fine, now it's The Guns of Navarone.

71
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,895
It is a great pleasure and thrill...

72
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,869
to be part of your wonderful organization.

73
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,962
Where are you from,
Bridgeport or someplace?

74
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,632
I'm from Paris.

75
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:11,540
And we French are using
more and more girls in our work.

76
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,773
It opens up a whole new area.

77
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:17,816
En garde.

78
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:23,989
Right, then maybe later on
we'll do a little fencing, too, huh?

79
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:28,625
- How are you feeling underneath there?
- Just fine.

80
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,662
You just look lovely.

81
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,130
Gil, we have Sheila Sommers here.

82
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:45,142
- You said you'd give her an appointment.
- Sommers?

83
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:47,737
Yes, of course.

84
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:50,915
You're lucky we can squeeze you in today.

85
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:57,950
She looks like she was squeezed in
long before she ever got here.

86
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,127
We want her to feel
like a beautiful young woman again.

87
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:06,165
- Have you tried prayer?
- We've tried everything.

88
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,447
That's Matt Helm's secretary.

89
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:28,147
- What's her name?
- Lovey Kravezit.

90
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,053
- Lovey Kravezit?
- What would you call her?

91
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,453
Okay, Miss Kravezit, you're cleared.

92
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,294
Thank you.

93
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,230
And thank you.

94
00:11:56,982 --> 00:12:00,077
- Would you like powder or cream?
- Surprise me.

95
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,248
I'm just a masseuse.

96
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,183
You surprised me.

97
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:09,923
Relax, you're all tensed up.

98
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:13,863
Mr. Helm, I just this second got here.

99
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:18,098
- Am I interrupting anything?
- No, she's just a masseuse.

100
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:21,405
I think I've got everything you want.

101
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:22,668
Yeah.

102
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:27,873
I brought your electric toothbrush,
and I even brought your mouthwash.

103
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,947
Only 36% more cavities.

104
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,848
But you don't care.

105
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,547
- Will there be anything else?
- No.

106
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:38,454
Yes. I'll meet you in the steam room.

107
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,455
Relax, you're all tensed up.

108
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:47,893
Here?

109
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,768
We're alone.

110
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:53,130
I guess it's kind of romantic.

111
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:55,967
Haven't you got a message for me?

112
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:59,136
- You always said I did.
- From MacDonald.

113
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:03,538
- No.
- No message? Are you sure?

114
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,213
There are messages and there are messages.

115
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,720
That's the way everything's been going
around here.

116
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,415
Haven't they taken good care of you?

117
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:13,481
There's taking care and
there's taking care.

118
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:17,659
There must be some little something
that I can do for you.

119
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,125
Poor Mr. Helm.

120
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,963
Okay, Matt, hold it right there.
I knewyou'd get to it.

121
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:29,563
What is this?

122
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:32,006
- Candid brassiere?
- Now listen.

123
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:34,808
- I'm all ears.
- Stop whatever you're doing.

124
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:38,009
- I can't hear a thing.
- Sheila Sommers holds the key...

125
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,848
to the most serious crisis
our country has ever faced.

126
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:43,581
Get close to her, Matt.
That's your assignment.

127
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,091
I want you on top of this
from morning to night.

128
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,626
I beg your pardon.

129
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:51,425
And furthermore, Matt,
don't let anybody there know what you're...

130
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:56,492
So much for his message.
Now, about your message.

131
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,795
- Who's Sheila Sommers?
- That's what I say.

132
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:12,277
Mr. Helm, it's time for your physical.

133
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,384
I'm way ahead of you.

134
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,549
Your attention, please.

135
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:23,322
As part of your final examination,
here is today's problem.

136
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:27,662
Imagine that you are a group of strangers
sharing a compartment on a European train.

137
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:29,895
One of you is supposed to be
a secret agent...

138
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:32,562
carrying a coded message
for a foreign power.

139
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:37,131
The assignment is to uncover that
secret agent and obtain the coded message.

140
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,701
The lights will be extinguished
from time to time...

141
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,304
to simulate passage
through several tunnels.

142
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,746
Good luck.

143
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,804
The man said to uncover the secret agent.

144
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:49,778
Attention, please.
This concludes today's exercise.

145
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:54,444
Please report to your officer in charge
for further instructions. Thank you.

146
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:04,221
Now we stop playing games, Mr. Helm.

147
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,422
No, not again.

148
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:12,465
This is not an experimental exercise.
This is a real gun with real bullets.

149
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:15,472
The only things loaded around here
are the girls.

150
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:19,442
What are your orders regarding
the missing experimental craft?

151
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:20,842
The what?

152
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:24,678
The so-called flying disc
your scientists have developed.

153
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,944
My lips are sealed.
I will never divulge that information.

154
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,780
Pretty good, huh? Can I go?

155
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,085
If you don't answer the question...

156
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:36,954
I'll kill you.

157
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,325
That's what I call really flunking.

158
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,479
Now you know why you're here.

159
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:01,310
To get killed.

160
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:06,057
Matt, have you ever seen a flying saucer?

161
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:09,518
Is that your way of offering me a drink?

162
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:11,118
We built one.

163
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:15,698
The first earth-built vehicle
to use electromagnetic force.

164
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,228
You're putting me on.

165
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:21,363
- Somebody kidnapped it.
- I don't blame them.

166
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:23,635
And Sheila Sommers took it up and...

167
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,262
Wait a minute. You put
a girl in that thing?

168
00:17:26,287 --> 00:17:28,102
And for a damn good reason.

169
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,739
You had a boy pilot, too?

170
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:33,250
Sheila Sommers is the best pilot
that lCE ever had.

171
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:36,019
But that's not the main reason.

172
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:39,847
What's the difference why?
She came back without it.

173
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:43,259
- What happened?
- That's what you're here to find out.

174
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:47,390
She can't remember.
We think you can help her to remember.

175
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:48,694
- Me?
- Sure.

176
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:52,260
You and Sheila worked an assignment
together once, remember?

177
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:53,566
As man and wife.

178
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:56,539
Yeah, newlyweds.
We were supposed to be on our honeymoon.

179
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:59,009
What I don't do for my country.

180
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:03,445
She won't let a man come near her.
But that's never stopped you before.

181
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:05,916
And maybe you can find out what we can't.

182
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:08,544
But there's one thing
I would like to find out.

183
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,385
There's only one way
he could have gotten in here.

184
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:15,724
Now, somebody on our side isn't.

185
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:24,593
No.

186
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:30,535
Just something to quiet you.
To help you to sleep.

187
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,739
- Help!
- It's locked.

188
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,747
They've heard you do that before,
and it won't...

189
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:41,252
- Help!
- Just put you to sleep.

190
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:43,245
No!

191
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,767
Hello, Mac, what are you doing here?

192
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:04,603
How do you do, Doctor?
I assume you've met my husband.

193
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,184
It's a good fight.

194
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:24,787
Here it comes.

195
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:38,269
When the chilli pot is nice and hot
Then drink some Montezuma

196
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:43,842
It will dance senor on to the floor
And shake senora's bloomer

197
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:46,946
She'll call you a sport
drink pint, drink quart

198
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,784
It will warm your solar plexus

199
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:55,359
Be a real big man, look for the can
That got the double "X's"

200
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,965
That's it?

201
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,528
Yeah.

202
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:06,233
We did some digging around.

203
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,134
That's a very popular
jingle down in Mexico.

204
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,668
That won't do us any good.
Sheila could have heard it anytime.

205
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:15,338
Maybe not.

206
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:18,843
See how you like it in this tempo.

207
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,094
The marching song of a secret organization.

208
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:34,928
A bunch of fanatics from all over Europe.
Their leader was a man named Caselius.

209
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:37,365
We thought they'd gone out of business.

210
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:41,395
Now they're selling beer.
Who is this Mr. Montezuma?

211
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:45,503
He's a millionaire named Quintana.

212
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:48,774
Lives in Acapulco. His
real name is Chibnik.

213
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,545
Ole.

214
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,848
As far as we know...

215
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:57,181
he hasn't been doing
any fooling around there, except with beer.

216
00:20:57,889 --> 00:20:59,448
No fooling around?

217
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:02,858
You don't tell me these two dames
were picked for their singing.

218
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:06,387
How would you like to take
Mr. Quintana's picture?

219
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:11,926
Do a big spread on him and the brewery
for a top magazine.

220
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:14,732
I don't know. ls the beer any good?

221
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:16,865
We've already set it up.

222
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:20,104
There are two tickets
on the 11:00 plane for Acapulco.

223
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,270
Two tickets?

224
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,872
- Sheila's going with you.
- No chance.

225
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:28,282
She thinks you're her husband. As long
as she's with you, she's all right...

226
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,716
- and she can help.
- Help?

227
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:34,453
The last thing I need is a dame around me
who thinks she's my wife.

228
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,220
You know how I operate.

229
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:40,061
Somewhere there's a man
who treated that girl like an animal.

230
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:44,035
Some way, she's going to see him again.
And when she does...

231
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:48,061
we'll know who's got what we want
and how we can get it back.

232
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,403
- I'm not going to do it.
- Yes, you are going to do it.

233
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,240
There's no other way.

234
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:58,045
Because wherever that saucer is,
the only one who can fly it out is Sheila.

235
00:21:58,116 --> 00:21:59,982
Do you want to know why?

236
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:02,213
Before setting up this last flight...

237
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:05,313
they ran a series of lab tests
on a variety of animals.

238
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:07,256
They all came out the same.

239
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,920
The females lived, the males died.

240
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,963
- What were they doing?
- Don't you understand?

241
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:20,132
An electromagnetic field has a strange
effect on the male of the species:

242
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,564
it kills them, dead.

243
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,303
I now pronounce me man and wife.

244
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,830
A second honeymoon in Acapulco.

245
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:47,493
How did you ever arrange it?

246
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:50,261
It wasn't easy.
I just told Mac right straight out.

247
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:53,600
I said I wanted to do this magazine job
in Mexico.

248
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:56,869
And now, no assignment for lCE
till we get back.

249
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:58,966
Is the magazine the only reason?

250
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:03,208
Not exactly. I can't wait to
get you south of the border.

251
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:59,733
Why don't you go unpack
and freshen up a bit...

252
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:03,604
while I check the exposure on this camera?

253
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,258
Manager.

254
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,929
That sweet thing down there,
what's her name?

255
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:34,438
Senor, stay away from that one.

256
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:37,133
You don't want to have
nothing to do with her.

257
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:39,870
- Why not? Who is she?
- My wife.

258
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:47,484
Why, you miserable...

259
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,804
I have an appointment. My name is Helm.

260
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:13,002
Senor Helm? Matt Helm?

261
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,972
Senor Quintana's expecting you.

262
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:21,109
I have a collection
of all of your photographs.

263
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,847
You're fantastic.

264
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:26,413
You seem to make a girl
look so beautiful...

265
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:29,820
so exciting, so...

266
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:33,027
Would you like to pose for me?

267
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:35,323
Oh, no.

268
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,977
Who's gonna want a beer with a head on it?

269
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:55,950
Mr. Helm, at last.

270
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:04,128
- We also have a brand called "Three 'X's."
- That I gotta see.

271
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:07,155
My assistant, Mrs. Helm.

272
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,393
- Delighted.
- Hello.

273
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,367
- That's a crazy six-pack.
- It's quite an occasion.

274
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:13,733
We're rolling
our millionth barrel of beer today.

275
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:15,203
You're my kind of guy.

276
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:18,538
We're going to celebrate.
I'm giving a large party this afternoon.

277
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:20,202
You're both invited, of course.

278
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:22,406
- I'll have my car pick you up.
- Thank you.

279
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:24,846
Allow me to show you around.

280
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,078
I know your work, Mr. Helm.

281
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:29,882
All those beautiful girls you photograph...

282
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:33,321
- Makes you want to...
- I do. I did!

283
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:41,589
In these vats is where the grain boils
at extraordinary temperatures.

284
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:43,865
All the grain vats.

285
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,861
This is our light beer.

286
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:49,404
Care for a taste?

287
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:52,841
I never touch the stuff,
except when I'm working.

288
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:59,448
I always say,
Montezuma is good for what ails you.

289
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:03,245
- Get it?
- I got it. it's clever.

290
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:05,551
I often make humorous remarks.

291
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,854
You Latins are a fun-loving people.

292
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:11,760
Here's another one, an XXX. I'll try that.

293
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,869
Just like Mother used to drink.

294
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,641
Matt, look.

295
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:32,272
Yeah, Sheila?

296
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:36,877
- What do you put in this beer?
- Fantastic, isn't it?

297
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:39,424
It gives an average man
the strength of a giant.

298
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,926
He can handle a 1,500-pound load.

299
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,924
I know the feeling.

300
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:47,556
It's controlled by
hydro-mechanical servo valves.

301
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:52,995
I wonder what that tastes like.
Here's a new one.

302
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:56,506
Matt, darling,
we do want to take in all the brewery.

303
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:59,069
I'm doing the best I can.

304
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:24,165
These young ladies help promote my beer
all over the world.

305
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:27,169
They sure lift the steins
for dear old Montezuma.

306
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:31,368
- The fashions are fabulous.
- The famous creations of Cassini.

307
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:33,838
- Ole!
- Oleg.

308
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:35,504
I never could speak that language.

309
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:37,707
You might want to include them
in your layout.

310
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:38,874
No, I'm a married man.

311
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:02,333
Enjoy yourselves. Excuse me.

312
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:14,743
You sure you've never met him before?

313
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,547
- Of course not.
- I don't know.

314
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:20,852
- He looked at you awful familiar.
- That's more than you do.

315
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,053
You're not acting
very much like a bridegroom.

316
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:25,493
I'll take care of that later.

317
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,236
His name is Jose Ortega.

318
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:52,273
- They say he's a very interesting man.
- What's he do?

319
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:55,276
What does any interesting man do?

320
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:59,686
- Look for it at your newsstand.
- Just a minute.

321
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:02,658
No "unidentified blonde" business.

322
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:06,525
- My name is Francesca Madeiros.
- Madeiros. Is that Greek?

323
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:09,092
Where are you from?

324
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:12,137
- The bar.
- The bar? I've got relatives there.

325
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:16,436
No, I'm really from
the Hotel del Cortez. Cottage F.

326
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,776
It must be beautiful there
this time of the year.

327
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:23,712
- You should see it.
- That's what I like. A girl with spirit.

328
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:27,278
You going to put me in your magazine?

329
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:29,352
Right between the covers.

330
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:41,059
- We're here, if you need us.
- I got the wife with me.

331
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:56,845
As an added feature,
this outfit has been given a belt.

332
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,179
I could use a belt myself.

333
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:11,058
- Somebody knows, I tell you!
- I'm more interested in the girl.

334
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:13,426
Are you certain she's the one?

335
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:16,899
Not completely.
That's why I wanted you to see her.

336
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,767
Looks are sometimes deceiving.

337
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:22,339
What about the husband?

338
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:25,604
His name is Helm,
a very well-known photographer in America.

339
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:29,442
He specializes in girls.
He could be just another one.

340
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:31,345
I'll soon find out.

341
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:35,786
Senor Helm, may I have that film, please?

342
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:37,184
Beg your pardon?

343
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:39,917
Senor Ortega does not like
his picture taken.

344
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:42,959
A small quirk. it's the scar, I think.

345
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:45,295
I'm sure you understand.

346
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:51,060
- No offense.
- Thank you, senor.

347
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:29,801
Send this message to Matt.

348
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:00,658
Is this what you're looking for?

349
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:03,029
For everything you did to me.

350
00:35:57,455 --> 00:36:00,254
- Hey, baby.
- Matt, can we leave now?

351
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:03,856
You honeymooners.
There's work to be done.

352
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:06,693
He's right, honey.
The party's just beginning to swing.

353
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:10,928
Have a drink. Dance a while.
Later on, we can have our interview.

354
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:16,232
- Hi.
- A little.

355
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:20,068
Who's your friend?

356
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:24,411
She invited me to her homeland,
the Hotel del Cortez.

357
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:28,245
- When you honeymoon.
- The more, the merrier.

358
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:30,480
Okay, baby.

359
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:07,955
I don't think I'm going to like
this next number.

360
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:25,003
Hey! Where's the funeral?

361
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:28,006
Come on, get with it.

362
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:30,809
Make them play. Let's go-go!

363
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:32,347
Come on!

364
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,509
Quintana, they won't play.

365
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:37,386
That's it.

366
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:45,522
Come on, everybody,
let's see what's going on.

367
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:10,314
Everybody drink.

368
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:14,023
- Everybody dance.
- What?

369
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:17,358
Everybody swim.

370
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:34,037
Get back to the hotel and wait for me.

371
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:36,910
- Aren't you coming?
- No, I don't want to miss the action.

372
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:41,178
Sometimes these things turn into brawls.
I don't want you here. Get going.

373
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:47,951
You'll tell me later. Now get going.
Come on.

374
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:19,419
Damn it.

375
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:08,093
Turn right on the next road.

376
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:34,091
I've got orders to kill you, baby.

377
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:37,957
But maybe if you're nice to me,
I'll let you live a little longer.

378
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:26,607
You don't waste any time, do you?

379
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:28,338
I just got here.

380
00:42:29,513 --> 00:42:32,073
Looks like you started without me.

381
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:37,747
Home is everything you said it was...

382
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:40,188
loaded with points of interest.

383
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:43,520
What's on your mind?

384
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:47,188
I thought we'd enjoy
the Late Show together.

385
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:49,258
I don't have a television set.

386
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:51,627
All the better.

387
00:42:57,007 --> 00:43:00,136
I certainly enjoyed your
little dance tonight.

388
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:03,874
You should have stayed. it got better.
I got carried away.

389
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:07,507
That's why I left. I didn't want to be.

390
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:09,985
Why did Quintana want to kill you?

391
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:12,489
Maybe he didn't like his proofs.

392
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:15,124
What is it he knows about you, baby?

393
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:18,059
Could be what I know about him.

394
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:20,356
I'd hoped you'd say that.

395
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:24,131
- What?
- His real name is Chibnik.

396
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:27,231
Everyone knows that.

397
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:29,870
Now, look, darling.

398
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:31,808
Darling...

399
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:35,872
I did something for you,
you do something for me.

400
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:40,347
- With pleasure.
- No, that's not it. Maybe later.

401
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:44,544
- Right now, though...
- Right now, what?

402
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:47,147
Where can I find a man named Caselius?

403
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:50,524
The last time I saw him,
he was in a helicopter.

404
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:51,991
Ortega?

405
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:55,557
Everyone knows that. Don't you?

406
00:43:57,167 --> 00:44:00,068
You said he was a rather interesting man.

407
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:03,396
- Where are his headquarters?
- You tell me.

408
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:07,234
It's going to be like that, is it?

409
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:08,842
Don't you know?

410
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:12,371
- If I did, you wouldn't be here.
- I get it.

411
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:16,511
That explains the psychological warfare
in the elevator.

412
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:20,587
The old alma mater,
the double "X" beer march.

413
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:24,127
That was to break Quintana down
so he could run to Caselius...

414
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:26,595
and you could follow him. Why?

415
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:28,698
Would you care for a drink?

416
00:44:28,723 --> 00:44:31,556
No, I'm not too fond
of that chloral hydrate.

417
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:33,195
Suit yourself.

418
00:44:42,913 --> 00:44:45,883
All right, so much for that.

419
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:51,983
Now it is later.

420
00:45:04,134 --> 00:45:05,829
That wasn't nice.

421
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:09,463
You can't blame a girl for trying.

422
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:12,504
You knew he was in there, didn't you?

423
00:45:13,577 --> 00:45:16,569
I could hear his hot breath
every time you moved.

424
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:19,173
I have that effect on some people.

425
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:24,445
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

426
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:27,917
You drugged me.

427
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:29,848
Just in case.

428
00:45:30,961 --> 00:45:32,451
How did you do that?

429
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:36,022
Do you like my lipstick, darling?
It's a special brand.

430
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:39,159
There's a chemical that
penetrates the skin.

431
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:42,364
- How about your skin?
- I just drank the antidote.

432
00:45:47,444 --> 00:45:50,038
That's right, baby. Get angry.

433
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:52,980
That increases the heart beat
and speeds up the drug.

434
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:55,144
Speed it up all the way.

435
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:15,465
Where is Caselius?

436
00:46:21,044 --> 00:46:23,069
I don't know.

437
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:26,141
- The girl... What?
- What girl?

438
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,218
Francesca.

439
00:46:30,654 --> 00:46:33,680
- What about her?
- Beautiful.

440
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:37,084
What a broad.

441
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:38,724
I'd like to...

442
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:42,060
She likes you, too, baby.
She likes you a lot.

443
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:46,732
You want to make it with her?

444
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:50,500
- Just tell her what she wants to hear.
- Beautiful.

445
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:53,942
That is not bad, but you
can do even better.

446
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:56,212
She's built like a...

447
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,840
That's not what she wants to hear.

448
00:46:59,516 --> 00:47:02,042
Tell her where is Caselius.

449
00:47:03,053 --> 00:47:04,452
I'll kill him.

450
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:09,382
I want to kill him, too,
but I have to find him first.

451
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:12,018
So tell me where he is.

452
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:14,722
Guadalajara?

453
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:17,263
Tecate?

454
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:22,199
Mexico City? Am I getting warm?

455
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:25,205
Very warm.

456
00:47:25,642 --> 00:47:27,474
Hold it right there.

457
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:30,110
Where?

458
00:47:30,714 --> 00:47:32,739
Get him out of it, fast.

459
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:37,880
I can bring him to, if
that's what you mean.

460
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:39,753
That's what I mean.

461
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:55,794
What a girl.

462
00:48:10,787 --> 00:48:12,551
How'd you find me?

463
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:15,058
I remembered about her homeland.

464
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:19,895
To think some guys complain
about jealous wives.

465
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:25,292
Were you watching for a long time?

466
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,561
- A long time.
- Did I have fun?

467
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:30,498
Wow.

468
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:32,575
That's "wow"?

469
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:37,074
- I do vaguely remember one thing.
- Yes?

470
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:42,017
I seem to recall you saying something about
getting rid of Caselius yourself. True?

471
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:43,280
Why?

472
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:49,317
A certain country is undergoing
some political unrest...

473
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:51,517
thanks to Mr. Caselius.

474
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:53,688
My orders are simple:

475
00:48:53,797 --> 00:48:57,097
To put the country to rest,
put Caselius to rest.

476
00:48:57,634 --> 00:49:00,160
Now, who are you?

477
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:03,972
- Let's say we're both after the same man.
- Yeah.

478
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:07,600
Tough enough to get him
without fighting each other.

479
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:10,306
Unless, of course, we work together.

480
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,711
- Partners?
- Partners.

481
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:15,215
Once we know where Caselius is...

482
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:18,949
I have some forged papers
that will get us in to him.

483
00:49:19,022 --> 00:49:23,050
We'll all take turns watching Quintana.
The first watch will be in the morning.

484
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,652
And chuckles can handle that one.

485
00:49:29,533 --> 00:49:33,163
- You don't trust her, do you?
- I don't trust any woman.

486
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:35,330
You can drop the act now.

487
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:39,475
- Come on.
- I was going to, anyway.

488
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:42,239
I checked us out of the motel.

489
00:49:42,346 --> 00:49:46,681
By now Quintana's men must be in the beds,
under the beds, and in the closets.

490
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:48,809
When did you snap out of it?

491
00:49:48,885 --> 00:49:52,515
You know that day on the funny farm,
when that nurse tried to kill me?

492
00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:55,991
When you walked in that door,
everything came back.

493
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:58,389
You sure fooled a lot of people.

494
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,725
That was the idea, Dr. Watson.

495
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:14,371
You know how Mac's mind works.
Never in a straight line.

496
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:18,278
I had to convince him that
I was 100% normal only if I were with you.

497
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:21,613
Then he'd have to send me back,
and I had to come back.

498
00:50:21,718 --> 00:50:22,947
Why?

499
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:25,716
To kill Caselius.

500
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:29,382
I tried tonight, with blanks.

501
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:31,689
That's the lousy kind of agent I am.

502
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:35,630
No. You played your own hand.
For you, not us.

503
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:40,801
You jumped a gun.
Took a chance of blowing the whole deal.

504
00:50:40,904 --> 00:50:43,737
That's the kind of a lousy agent you are.

505
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:48,269
Now that I've said that,
and knowing what I do about Caselius...

506
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:51,581
too bad you missed.

507
00:50:57,087 --> 00:51:01,115
Don't answer it. it's Quintana
trying to find out how dead I am.

508
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:02,623
What do you mean?

509
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:06,890
The next time you send me off by myself,
look in the back seat.

510
00:51:11,802 --> 00:51:13,634
Where are we going?

511
00:51:29,286 --> 00:51:32,779
- What are you stopping here for?
- Quintana's a big man.

512
00:51:32,956 --> 00:51:36,824
Every motel in Acapulco
has our description by now.

513
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:39,928
We'll spend the night
at the outdoor Hilton.

514
00:51:41,531 --> 00:51:43,018
Baby, it's cold outside.

515
00:51:43,043 --> 00:51:46,015
Maybe he's got some
blankets in the trunk.

516
00:51:57,981 --> 00:51:59,471
There we are.

517
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:03,517
I wonder what that is.

518
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,021
Look out!

519
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,024
Instant motel.

520
00:53:10,587 --> 00:53:12,715
Come on, step right in.

521
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:18,784
Are you ready for this?

522
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:23,865
Now that we're no longer man and wife...

523
00:53:24,768 --> 00:53:27,066
I'll sleep on the other side.

524
00:53:27,137 --> 00:53:30,801
If that bed tilts up and I
fall in the pool, I'm leaving.

525
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:50,893
Do you have a plan?

526
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:53,428
- Yeah.
- What is it?

527
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:58,662
I'm going to say it's getting a
little chilly and I think that...

528
00:53:59,135 --> 00:54:02,594
we should cuddle up together for warmth.

529
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,808
Good plan. it might work.

530
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,182
I am the old Sheila.

531
00:54:13,783 --> 00:54:16,753
You can depend on me.
I won't disappoint you.

532
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,685
You didn't.

533
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:34,167
I love my wife, but, oh, you, Sheila.

534
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:17,405
Senor, I think a double-cross.

535
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:20,412
I'm going in. You stay here.

536
00:55:20,517 --> 00:55:24,249
- Matt, I'm scared.
- All right, I'll stay here. You go in.

537
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:39,419
Now I know we're partners.
We're trying to kill each other.

538
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:49,138
- Saved.
- Help!

539
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:53,833
I'm drowning!

540
00:56:58,148 --> 00:57:01,641
- I can't swim.
- Drink yourself to the bottom.

541
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:06,014
That madman, Karl, he pushed me in here.

542
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:09,291
And you told him where to find Caselius?

543
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:13,254
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Okay.

544
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:16,659
Please.

545
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:32,880
- Help me.
- What's happening?

546
00:57:33,016 --> 00:57:36,384
The settling vats,
part of the fermentation process.

547
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:38,686
There are iron rollers.

548
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:42,053
- We'll be killed.
- Why? it doesn't hurt the beer.

549
00:57:51,334 --> 00:57:53,462
- Don't let me go.
- Come on.

550
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:56,706
- Where's Caselius?
- I don't know.

551
00:58:01,878 --> 00:58:04,904
- Caselius.
- He's in the jungle.

552
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:08,375
- Where?
- Copala Valley.

553
00:58:08,718 --> 00:58:10,015
Help me!

554
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:32,065
You can still make a spare.

555
00:58:44,787 --> 00:58:47,051
A little on the Brooklyn side.

556
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:27,274
Ole.

557
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:46,098
Copala Valley is about 100 miles from here,
according to this map...

558
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:48,261
and a torture test all the way.

559
01:01:48,905 --> 01:01:50,737
Good.

560
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:08,084
I just hope that ape-man
was able to contact the lady...

561
01:02:08,157 --> 01:02:10,091
and tell her where to find Caselius.

562
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:12,651
- You hope what?
- We can use her.

563
01:02:13,129 --> 01:02:16,622
She has documents
that can get her into Caselius' hideout.

564
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:18,258
You can't trust her.

565
01:02:18,334 --> 01:02:21,668
Maybe not.
But her gorilla tried to kill Quintana.

566
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:24,271
So she's not on their side, either.

567
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:26,775
We'll never catch her.
She has a big head start.

568
01:02:26,843 --> 01:02:30,404
We'll catch her.
And when I called up this morning...

569
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,480
just to touch base...

570
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:36,746
she asked how the roads were around here
and if she needed a jeep or something.

571
01:02:36,819 --> 01:02:40,278
I said the roads were all good
and that her car would do just fine.

572
01:02:40,356 --> 01:02:42,120
So just about now...

573
01:02:42,291 --> 01:02:44,783
she should be calling me
all kinds of a dirty...

574
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:47,829
no-good lying rat.

575
01:03:19,028 --> 01:03:22,157
Howdy, partner. Funny place for a pit stop.

576
01:03:22,231 --> 01:03:24,859
If it isn't the man from the auto club.

577
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:27,834
You were right, mister.
I didn't need a jeep.

578
01:03:27,904 --> 01:03:29,633
I needed a tank.

579
01:03:29,906 --> 01:03:33,706
I've been called that before, too.
Hop in. I'll give you a lift.

580
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,141
Why?

581
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:39,214
- Because you're a fun girl.
- Yeah. You're back on the team.

582
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:42,579
Partners again? I'm surprised you trust me.

583
01:03:43,186 --> 01:03:47,589
You need us as much as we need you,
and you've got the papers to get in there.

584
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:50,421
That's right. So why do I need you?

585
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:53,820
To get out. Now get in.

586
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:16,786
- This must be the place.
- Okay, Big John, what's the caper?

587
01:04:16,953 --> 01:04:18,751
Remember those pictures?

588
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:21,222
Let's stash these in the bushes.

589
01:04:22,124 --> 01:04:24,422
You're taking over, you know.

590
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:27,720
You get to Caselius, show him your papers.

591
01:04:27,797 --> 01:04:30,289
Maybe he'll go for it, maybe he won't.

592
01:04:30,566 --> 01:04:34,264
But tell him somebody's following you.
I want him to be ready for me.

593
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:37,533
- Ready for you?
- I want to walk right into his hands.

594
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:40,142
- But, Matt!
- That'll prove you're really one of them.

595
01:04:40,243 --> 01:04:43,907
And once he's sure that he can trust you,
he'll relax.

596
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:47,416
And the way I figure, he likes to relax.

597
01:04:48,584 --> 01:04:50,416
Here, turn around.

598
01:04:53,956 --> 01:04:55,549
That'll help.

599
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:58,287
Would you like me to leave?

600
01:04:58,661 --> 01:05:01,722
Muss your hair up,
smear some dirt on your face.

601
01:05:01,797 --> 01:05:04,425
- And then what?
- We'll play it by ear.

602
01:05:04,667 --> 01:05:07,602
It's the last place I would have suspected.

603
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:11,236
I've taken a lot from you, little girl.

604
01:05:11,307 --> 01:05:13,674
Maybe we shouldn't
see each other anymore.

605
01:05:13,776 --> 01:05:16,905
That's the spirit. That's fine. Good. Here.

606
01:05:16,979 --> 01:05:19,744
That's heavy. What is it?
A new kind of weapon?

607
01:05:19,815 --> 01:05:22,750
Just put it in your purse.
Chances are they won't search you.

608
01:05:22,818 --> 01:05:26,118
- How do I use it?
- You don't. That's my department.

609
01:05:28,124 --> 01:05:30,183
You'd better get started.

610
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:33,323
How do I find our friend?

611
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:36,694
Just drive towards those mountains.
He'll find you.

612
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:39,995
And good luck, baby. You can do it.

613
01:05:40,536 --> 01:05:41,867
She will.

614
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:44,970
What about a good-luck kiss?

615
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:47,703
Why not? I'm superstitious, myself.

616
01:06:05,528 --> 01:06:08,896
Don't say it.
You may hate her guts, but she's a pro.

617
01:06:09,665 --> 01:06:13,363
- Whatever she's pro, I'm anti.
- Come on, Auntie.

618
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:35,154
- What is it?
- I thought I heard something.

619
01:06:35,224 --> 01:06:36,692
A taxi?

620
01:07:06,255 --> 01:07:08,451
She ought to be there by now.

621
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:12,254
There's the jeep.

622
01:07:13,062 --> 01:07:16,692
- I don't see the saucer.
- Patience, Auntie.

623
01:07:18,934 --> 01:07:22,871
If there's something hidden down there,
we'll get a shot of it.

624
01:07:22,938 --> 01:07:26,101
- What's that?
- It's a heat camera, infrared.

625
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:51,424
Well, look what's going on in the woods.

626
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:54,765
There's a hell of a big truck,
there's some motorcycles...

627
01:07:54,837 --> 01:07:57,329
and there's baby. The man-killer.

628
01:07:57,973 --> 01:07:59,839
They wouldn't keep it out in the open.

629
01:07:59,942 --> 01:08:03,003
That's what the tracks are for,
to bring it to the launch site.

630
01:08:03,112 --> 01:08:04,807
I'm going in at dawn.

631
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:07,576
Give me a few minutes,
then head towards the saucer.

632
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:10,676
I gotta find that controlling device
and put it out of action.

633
01:08:10,786 --> 01:08:14,188
When Caselius hits the fan,
there's gonna be a lot of gunfire.

634
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:16,657
The minute you hear it, you fly.

635
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:19,456
- I fly, what do you do?
- I'll find something.

636
01:08:19,628 --> 01:08:23,861
We have a long wait ahead of us,
so let's get comfortable.

637
01:08:28,838 --> 01:08:30,431
How comfortable?

638
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:32,939
It's broad daylight.

639
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:36,643
What's the matter with a broad in daylight?

640
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:09,877
Suspenders and a belt?

641
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:12,414
I have trouble keeping my pants up.

642
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:16,643
Special brand.

643
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:20,720
Contains a magic ingredient: happy gas.

644
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:23,382
It makes you rather switch than fight.

645
01:09:26,862 --> 01:09:28,660
Here we go.

646
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:34,102
Don't tell me
you're going to say "be careful"?

647
01:09:34,203 --> 01:09:36,171
I wouldn't dream of it.

648
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:41,432
Be careful.

649
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:29,684
Mr. Helm, I've been expecting you.

650
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:36,523
Nothing like roughing it.

651
01:11:37,559 --> 01:11:40,187
It can get rough, Mr. Helm.

652
01:11:40,863 --> 01:11:42,729
Very rough, indeed.

653
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:49,002
You left something.

654
01:12:06,088 --> 01:12:07,522
Show them in.

655
01:12:22,905 --> 01:12:26,102
Gen. Caselius, may you walk in prosperity.

656
01:12:26,575 --> 01:12:30,341
The girl is Helm's partner.
I found her nearby with this gun.

657
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:37,077
She has a great love for firearms.

658
01:12:41,724 --> 01:12:44,523
We're old friends, aren't we, my dear?

659
01:12:52,134 --> 01:12:55,399
- I owe you a debt of gratitude, Senor...
- Nassim.

660
01:12:55,738 --> 01:12:58,799
A letter of introduction
from my organization.

661
01:12:59,808 --> 01:13:02,607
As you can see,
I'm empowered to offer you a large sum...

662
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:05,271
for a certain aircraft in your possession.

663
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:06,915
How did you find me?

664
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:10,247
The light of the gracious moon
illumined my path.

665
01:13:10,619 --> 01:13:12,951
Also, I followed Mr. Helm.

666
01:13:13,789 --> 01:13:17,248
May a thousand tigers break every bone
in your body.

667
01:13:19,762 --> 01:13:22,424
It is a very generous offer.

668
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:39,279
Mexican cigarettes, Mr. Helm?

669
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:41,515
I couldn't find my own brand.

670
01:13:41,617 --> 01:13:45,281
As a matter of fact, I wouldn't mind
an American cigarette right now.

671
01:13:45,354 --> 01:13:47,652
- Anybody have one?
- Sorry.

672
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:54,429
Is this what you're looking for?

673
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:01,635
You made a Picasso out of it.

674
01:14:01,703 --> 01:14:05,367
- And you made something else out of me.
- I did the best I could.

675
01:14:05,474 --> 01:14:10,002
You see, the lady represents
a rather well-known organization.

676
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:12,338
Maybe you have heard of it?

677
01:14:12,681 --> 01:14:15,946
The Bureau for international Government
and Order.

678
01:14:16,018 --> 01:14:17,281
B.l.G.O.

679
01:14:18,187 --> 01:14:20,554
- Big O?
- Bingo.

680
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:28,020
She has made a rather interesting offer
for the saucer, herself.

681
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:30,462
Then we shall be bidding
against each other.

682
01:14:30,532 --> 01:14:32,057
I'm afraid not.

683
01:14:32,367 --> 01:14:36,497
I threw in a little sweetener
I don't think you can match.

684
01:14:38,574 --> 01:14:41,475
I'm sorry to disappoint the both of you.

685
01:14:42,211 --> 01:14:44,179
The bidding is over.

686
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:47,177
Just this morning,
I concluded an arrangement...

687
01:14:47,249 --> 01:14:51,208
with an Oriental gentleman
whose name I cannot pronounce...

688
01:14:51,753 --> 01:14:55,348
for a rather large sum,
which, happily, I can pronounce.

689
01:14:56,024 --> 01:14:59,187
$100 million...

690
01:14:59,261 --> 01:15:02,253
due on delivery of the saucer
this very night.

691
01:15:09,638 --> 01:15:11,106
There it is.

692
01:15:12,641 --> 01:15:16,600
Lovely, graceful, soaring bird.

693
01:15:18,146 --> 01:15:20,308
Who would have ever dreamt...

694
01:15:20,415 --> 01:15:23,612
that the first man on the moon
would be eating chow mein?

695
01:15:23,719 --> 01:15:27,986
If there's two of them, they can have
their choice of egg roll or won ton.

696
01:15:38,467 --> 01:15:42,802
Come, before we go our several ways.

697
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:50,172
A little celebration.

698
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:11,100
What I always wanted, a magic bartender.

699
01:16:30,118 --> 01:16:32,314
The old Indian booze trick.

700
01:16:39,294 --> 01:16:42,628
Cheers, 100 million of them.

701
01:16:44,066 --> 01:16:46,660
- Skol.
- Sure it's cold, it's got ice in it.

702
01:16:49,905 --> 01:16:53,170
And now I must make certain preparations.

703
01:16:58,747 --> 01:16:59,805
Guard.

704
01:17:02,084 --> 01:17:06,817
Francesca, Nassim, you will be shown
to my guest quarters to freshen up.

705
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:11,549
And you, my dear, you will remain with me.

706
01:17:12,761 --> 01:17:14,820
And you, my friend...

707
01:17:15,697 --> 01:17:18,325
You're going to say something rude.

708
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:22,064
The traditional fate of the spy:
the firing squad.

709
01:17:22,738 --> 01:17:24,331
That's class.

710
01:17:24,506 --> 01:17:26,531
- Be brave, partner.
- Don't worry.

711
01:17:26,608 --> 01:17:30,067
The cavalry will come in the nick of time.
It always does.

712
01:17:30,178 --> 01:17:32,112
Remember those pictures?

713
01:17:33,081 --> 01:17:36,949
- My general!
- See?

714
01:17:37,419 --> 01:17:40,354
I came to warn you,
that man Helm is on his...

715
01:17:42,057 --> 01:17:43,422
Hi, gang.

716
01:17:43,625 --> 01:17:45,923
He's on his way to be executed.

717
01:17:46,028 --> 01:17:48,725
I assumed it was you who told him
where he could find me.

718
01:17:48,797 --> 01:17:51,129
I had to. He would have let me drown.

719
01:17:51,967 --> 01:17:54,197
- You swine!
- Good.

720
01:17:54,803 --> 01:17:57,898
I like your attitude.
I put you in charge of the firing squad.

721
01:17:57,973 --> 01:17:59,372
Yes, my general.

722
01:17:59,541 --> 01:18:03,034
- Get down below. Have them report at once.
- Yes, my general.

723
01:18:03,111 --> 01:18:04,772
And no mistakes!

724
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:06,905
No mistakes. Move!

725
01:18:13,622 --> 01:18:16,057
May good fortune smile upon you.

726
01:18:17,659 --> 01:18:20,492
May your steps be bathed in sunshine.

727
01:18:20,595 --> 01:18:23,587
May I have a bottle of
this excellent Scotch?

728
01:18:38,613 --> 01:18:42,345
Snap out of it, honey. You're a mess. Come.

729
01:18:43,685 --> 01:18:45,744
Fix yourself a little bit.

730
01:18:45,821 --> 01:18:48,847
You don't mind a little lipstick on you,
do you?

731
01:18:48,957 --> 01:18:51,688
A general must endure many things.

732
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:58,195
And now a little drink so you can relax.

733
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:00,759
Here you can finish mine.

734
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:07,969
We don't want you passing out
at the wrong time, do we?

735
01:19:08,043 --> 01:19:10,774
There, don't you feel a little better now?

736
01:19:12,114 --> 01:19:15,675
I'll just run along
and leave you two young things...

737
01:19:16,384 --> 01:19:18,375
to spoon in the parlor.

738
01:19:28,663 --> 01:19:30,461
An excellent whiskey.

739
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,459
Have a drink, my friend.

740
01:20:06,334 --> 01:20:07,927
You like that?

741
01:20:09,905 --> 01:20:12,931
Wait. You want to see more?

742
01:20:14,843 --> 01:20:16,277
Turn around.

743
01:20:22,951 --> 01:20:24,578
Now you can look.

744
01:20:56,585 --> 01:20:57,882
Thank you.

745
01:20:57,953 --> 01:21:01,651
I knew you would know how to open it,
the top pilot for B.l.G.O.

746
01:21:01,790 --> 01:21:04,725
Don't be foolish, man, you can't do that!

747
01:21:04,893 --> 01:21:06,827
You'll be killed!

748
01:21:40,428 --> 01:21:43,420
Come on, guys,
don't tell me in this day and age...

749
01:21:43,498 --> 01:21:46,263
of atom bombs, flying saucers,
and secret weapons...

750
01:21:46,334 --> 01:21:50,202
you'll stand me in front of a firing squad.
You're putting me on, right?

751
01:21:50,305 --> 01:21:51,466
Silence!

752
01:21:51,539 --> 01:21:54,941
I believe the expression is,
"Silence, Yankee dog."

753
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:56,774
Or "Yankee pig"?

754
01:22:10,358 --> 01:22:13,453
- No blindfold?
- No blindfold.

755
01:22:14,362 --> 01:22:16,990
- Don't I get a last request?
- No.

756
01:22:18,533 --> 01:22:21,332
You sure got a lot to learn
about firing squads.

757
01:22:21,403 --> 01:22:23,531
- How about a cigarette?
- No.

758
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:28,070
- Come on, just one little cigarette.
- Cigarettes are not good for you.

759
01:22:31,346 --> 01:22:33,906
It's part of the tradition.
I'm a dying man.

760
01:22:34,015 --> 01:22:38,213
I'm entitled to one cigarette, any
cigarette. A Mexican cigarette.

761
01:22:40,255 --> 01:22:42,587
- I haven't any.
- He does.

762
01:22:50,498 --> 01:22:53,195
I'll remember you from the great beyond.

763
01:22:53,735 --> 01:22:56,534
Somewhere around Steubenville, I hope.

764
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:01,532
No matches.

765
01:23:18,193 --> 01:23:19,752
No matches.

766
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:23,721
Now, don't tell me...

767
01:23:24,599 --> 01:23:26,260
I got a match.

768
01:23:30,438 --> 01:23:33,305
- God bless you, sir.
- It is my last one.

769
01:23:37,746 --> 01:23:41,376
- You're nervous?
- You're right.

770
01:23:42,650 --> 01:23:44,709
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

771
01:23:44,786 --> 01:23:46,652
Get ready to shoot him.

772
01:23:49,257 --> 01:23:51,988
- Hurry up!
- I'm doing the best I can.

773
01:24:07,108 --> 01:24:08,906
That means "ready."

774
01:24:15,583 --> 01:24:17,779
- That means...
- I know.

775
01:24:51,886 --> 01:24:54,787
- That is pretty funny, isn't it?
- Yes.

776
01:24:55,156 --> 01:24:57,625
- Having a good time?
- Yes.

777
01:24:57,992 --> 01:25:01,553
I'd better save some of this
for the rest of the guys.

778
01:25:06,167 --> 01:25:09,467
Go ahead, you tell them
they don't want to shoot anybody.

779
01:25:23,685 --> 01:25:26,382
You're doing a good job, a fine job.

780
01:25:26,821 --> 01:25:29,756
I'd better stop. I'll get smashed, myself.

781
01:25:30,391 --> 01:25:35,158
I'll blow everything, you know: Sheila,
Caselius, and the saucer. Everything.

782
01:25:35,530 --> 01:25:38,329
Your gun, please. Can I borrow your gun?

783
01:25:39,868 --> 01:25:41,427
Here, take mine.

784
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:48,002
You're the best friend a fellow ever had.

785
01:25:48,076 --> 01:25:51,671
Why don't you lie down
and sleep this thing off, gang?

786
01:25:51,746 --> 01:25:53,180
Here, lie down.

787
01:26:01,256 --> 01:26:03,190
That means "good night."

788
01:26:18,106 --> 01:26:19,904
Don't make so much noise.

789
01:26:24,779 --> 01:26:27,578
Do not be alarmed
if you hear anything unusual.

790
01:26:27,649 --> 01:26:30,949
Keep your eyes straight ahead.
Do not investigate.

791
01:26:36,491 --> 01:26:38,585
Now, my dear Sheila.

792
01:26:40,595 --> 01:26:43,496
I'm going to ask you a few questions...

793
01:26:43,598 --> 01:26:46,431
about the organization that you work for.

794
01:26:46,834 --> 01:26:50,270
If you answer them correctly,
no harm will come to you.

795
01:26:50,905 --> 01:26:52,339
If you don't...

796
01:26:53,641 --> 01:26:58,238
You remember the experiments
we conducted the last time you were here?

797
01:27:00,315 --> 01:27:01,339
Good.

798
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:07,413
And now...

799
01:27:08,423 --> 01:27:10,448
to lend a little spice.

800
01:27:43,958 --> 01:27:46,825
Okay, big boy, what are you waiting for?

801
01:28:54,095 --> 01:28:55,358
You...

802
01:28:57,198 --> 01:28:59,428
drugged me.

803
01:29:00,435 --> 01:29:01,869
The hard way.

804
01:29:52,186 --> 01:29:54,245
My general!

805
01:29:54,489 --> 01:29:56,583
- Helm has escaped!
- What?

806
01:29:56,691 --> 01:29:59,592
- I'll have you killed for this!
- I know that.

807
01:29:59,660 --> 01:30:02,493
Never mind.
The girl is on her way to the ship.

808
01:30:02,597 --> 01:30:05,589
- Get in there, lock the controls!
- Yes, my general.

809
01:30:24,819 --> 01:30:26,514
The controlling device.

810
01:31:03,191 --> 01:31:06,593
The Iron Lady is in control of the ship.

811
01:31:07,562 --> 01:31:09,326
You have no chance.

812
01:31:09,397 --> 01:31:12,059
Now, where were we, my dear?

813
01:31:43,464 --> 01:31:45,296
Release...

814
01:31:46,634 --> 01:31:48,966
- or we explode.
- All right...

815
01:31:49,904 --> 01:31:51,736
let's play chicken.

816
01:32:24,238 --> 01:32:25,797
That's better.

817
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:28,265
Yes, much better.

818
01:32:29,277 --> 01:32:31,575
You hear about money...

819
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:37,984
Don't struggle. I can be very nice to you.
Very nice.

820
01:32:38,085 --> 01:32:42,488
Why don't you let me hold you in my arms?
Isn't that what you wanted?

821
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:34,466
She'll never get away now.

822
01:36:49,403 --> 01:36:51,030
Welcome aboard.

823
01:36:55,843 --> 01:36:58,244
I'll pick you up on the way back.

824
01:39:07,007 --> 01:39:09,806
Let Helm put you in the driver's seat.

825
01:39:36,003 --> 01:39:37,198
I think we got it made.

826
01:39:38,272 --> 01:39:41,503
Matt, you've had a great deal of success
around here...

827
01:39:41,575 --> 01:39:44,101
instructing the girl recruits.

828
01:39:44,912 --> 01:39:47,404
We're bringing in a new agent...

829
01:39:47,514 --> 01:39:51,212
and I'd like you to teach this new agent
a few tricks.

830
01:39:51,285 --> 01:39:53,913
A new agent? Blonde or redhead?

831
01:39:54,455 --> 01:39:57,550
Brunette. Right in there.

832
01:39:58,192 --> 01:39:59,626
Why not?

833
01:40:09,570 --> 01:40:13,200
- You're the brunette?
- I was. Blondes have more fun.

834
01:40:14,808 --> 01:40:16,970
We'll soon find out.

835
01:40:21,215 --> 01:40:25,118
There'll be times when you'll find yourself
in a romantic situation...

836
01:40:25,219 --> 01:40:27,051
with an enemy agent.

837
01:40:27,454 --> 01:40:30,082
You've got to just let yourself go...

838
01:40:30,157 --> 01:40:32,285
be soft and yielding.

839
01:40:32,626 --> 01:40:35,459
- A little champagne.
- I don't drink.

840
01:40:35,963 --> 01:40:38,557
- A little love.
- I don't drink.

841
01:40:39,666 --> 01:40:42,158
Soft lights and music.

842
01:40:42,269 --> 01:40:45,239
Especially music, that'll do it every time.

843
01:40:45,839 --> 01:40:50,834
- Just relax. Now you pay close attention.
- You can count on me, sir.

844
01:40:57,017 --> 01:40:58,746
Nice voice.

845
01:41:00,821 --> 01:41:04,155
I'm sorry, Mr. Helm.
I guess I'm just not in the mood.

846
01:41:13,700 --> 01:41:15,099
Kiss me.

847
01:41:20,874 --> 01:41:23,605
Do you really like Perry Como that much?
