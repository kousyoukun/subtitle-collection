interrupting anything?

No, she's just a masseuse.

everything you want.

electric toothbrush,

brought your mouthwash.

a secret agent

Carrying a coded message
for a foreign power.

The assignment is to uncover
that secret agent

And obtain the coded message.

328
00:20:25,413 --> 00:20:28,316
The marching song of
a secret organization.

329
00:20:28,349 --> 00:20:30,351
A bunch of fanatics
from all over Europe.

330
00:20:30,384 --> 00:20:33,254
Their leader was
a man named caselius.

331
00:20:33,287 --> 00:20:35,456
We thought they'd
gone out of business.

332
00:20:35,489 --> 00:20:37,025
Now they're selling beer.

333
00:20:37,058 --> 00:20:40,294
Who is this Mr. montezuma?

334
00:20:40,328 --> 00:20:43,832
He's a millionaire
named quintana.

335
00:20:43,865 --> 00:20:47,268
Lives in acapulco.
His real name is chibnik.

337
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:51,472
As far as we know

338
00:20:51,505 --> 00:20:55,243
He hasn't been doing
any fooling around down there,
you know, except with beer.

339
00:20:55,877 --> 00:20:57,378
No fooling around?

You don't tell
me these 2 dames

their singing.

342
00:21:01,482 --> 00:21:05,186
Matt, how would you like
to take Mr. quintana's
picture?

343
00:21:05,219 --> 00:21:08,289
You know, do a big spread
on him and the brewery

344

I don't know.
Is the beer any good?

We've already set it up.

347
00:21:15,429 --> 00:21:17,899
There are 2 tickets
on the 11:00
plane for acapulco.

348
00:21:17,932 --> 00:21:19,133
2 tickets?

349
00:21:19,167 --> 00:21:20,568
Sheila's going with you.

350
00:21:20,601 --> 00:21:21,970
No chance.

351
00:21:22,003 --> 00:21:23,938
Matt, she thinks
you're her husband.

352
00:21:23,972 --> 00:21:26,374
As long as she's with you,
she's all right.

353
00:21:26,407 --> 00:21:27,508
And she can help.

354
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,443
Help?

355
00:21:29,477 --> 00:21:32,580
The last thing I need
is a dame around me
who thinks she's my wife.

356
00:21:32,613 --> 00:21:34,883
You know how I operate.

357
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:38,352
Matt, somewhere there's a man
who treated that
girl like an animal.

358
00:21:38,386 --> 00:21:40,554
Some way, she's going to
see him again.

359
00:21:40,588 --> 00:21:42,290
And when she does

360
00:21:42,323 --> 00:21:44,092
We'll know
who's got what we want

361
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:46,027
And how we can get it back.

362
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,461
I'm not going to do it.

363
00:21:47,495 --> 00:21:49,497
Yes, you are going to do it.

364
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,532
There's no other way.

365
00:21:51,565 --> 00:21:53,434
Because wherever
that saucer is,

366
00:21:53,467 --> 00:21:56,137
The only one who can
fly it out of there is Sheila.

367
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,306
Do you want to know why?

368
00:21:58,339 --> 00:22:00,508
Before setting up
this last flight,

369
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:03,444
They ran
a series of lab tests
on a variety of animals.

370
00:22:03,477 --> 00:22:05,546
They all came out the same.

371
00:22:05,579 --> 00:22:07,982
The females lived,
the males died.

372
00:22:09,918 --> 00:22:11,385
What were they doing?

373
00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:13,888
Matt, don't you understand?

374
00:22:13,922 --> 00:22:18,526
An electromagnetic field
has a very strange effect
on the male of the species:

375
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,896
It kills them, dead.

376
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:24,365
I now pronounce
me man and wife.

ever arrange it?

I just told Mac
right straight out.

381

do this magazine job
in Mexico.

382
00:22:51,592 --> 00:22:55,196
And now,
no assignment for i.C.E.
Till we get back.

383
00:22:55,229 --> 00:22:57,065
Is the magazine
the only reason?

00:45:37,324 --> 00:45:38,891
How about your skin?

651
00:45:38,925 --> 00:45:40,427
I just drank the antidote.

652
00:45:45,332 --> 00:45:48,435
Ah, that's right, baby.
Get angry, get angry.

653
00:45:48,468 --> 00:45:51,003
That increases the heart beat
and speeds up the drug.

654
00:45:51,037 --> 00:45:52,939
Speed it up all the way.

655
00:46:11,458 --> 00:46:13,393
Where is caselius?

656
00:46:14,594 --> 00:46:17,397
Where is caselius?

657
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:18,798
Caselius,

658
00:46:18,831 --> 00:46:21,501
I don't... i don't know, oh.

659
00:46:21,534 --> 00:46:22,769
The girl, what?

660
00:46:22,802 --> 00:46:23,836
What girl?

661
00:46:24,804 --> 00:46:26,072
Francesca.

662
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:28,675

663
00:46:28,708 --> 00:46:30,109
What about her?

664
00:46:30,142 --> 00:46:32,945
Beautiful, beautiful. Oh.

665
00:46:32,979 --> 00:46:35,448

666
00:46:35,482 --> 00:46:37,016
I'd like to...

667
00:46:37,049 --> 00:46:40,387
She likes you, too, baby.
She likes you a lot.

668
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:41,020
Hmm.

669
00:46:42,555 --> 00:46:44,056
You want to make it with her?

670
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:45,558
Oh.

671
00:46:45,592 --> 00:46:47,360
You just tell her
what she wants to hear.

672
00:46:47,394 --> 00:46:48,795
Beautiful.

673
00:46:48,828 --> 00:46:52,432
That is not bad,
but you can do even better.

674
00:46:52,465 --> 00:46:54,133
She's built like a...

675
00:46:54,166 --> 00:46:57,470
That's not what
she wants to hear.

676
00:46:57,504 --> 00:46:59,839
Tell her where is caselius.

677
00:47:01,107 --> 00:47:04,010
I'll kill him. I'll kill him.

678
00:47:04,043 --> 00:47:07,914
I want to kill him, too,
but I have to find him first.

679
00:47:07,947 --> 00:47:09,749
So tell me where he is.

680
00:47:11,451 --> 00:47:12,785
Guadalajara?

681

Tecate?

682
00:47:17,089 --> 00:47:20,159
Mexico city?
Am I getting warm?

683
00:47:20,192 --> 00:47:23,530
Oh, very warm. Very warm.

684
00:47:23,563 --> 00:47:25,398
Hold it right there.

685
00:47:26,699 --> 00:47:28,535
Where?

686
00:47:28,568 --> 00:47:30,603
Get him out of it, fast.

687
00:47:32,839 --> 00:47:35,908
I can bring him to,
if that's what you mean.

688
00:47:35,942 --> 00:47:37,744
That's what I mean.

689

(Matt)
Francesca.

690
00:47:49,822 --> 00:47:52,525
Francesca, phew.

691
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:53,860
What a girl.

692
00:48:08,841 --> 00:48:10,710
How'd you find me?

693
00:48:10,743 --> 00:48:12,779
I remembered
about her homeland.

694
00:48:14,747 --> 00:48:17,750
To think some guys complain
about jealous wives.

695
00:48:20,887 --> 00:48:23,022
Were you watching
for a long time?

696
00:48:23,923 --> 00:48:25,458
A long time.

697
00:48:25,492 --> 00:48:26,493
Did I have fun?

698
00:48:27,193 --> 00:48:28,495
Wow.

699
00:48:29,061 --> 00:48:31,097
That's "wow"?

700
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:33,833
Oh, I do vaguely
remember one thing.

701
00:48:33,866 --> 00:48:35,167
Yes?

702
00:48:35,201 --> 00:48:37,537
I seem to recall
you saying something

703
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:39,939
About getting rid of
caselius yourself. True?

704
00:48:39,972 --> 00:48:42,675
Why?

705
00:48:42,709 --> 00:48:47,580
A certain country
is undergoing
some political unrest

706
00:48:47,614 --> 00:48:49,982
Thanks to Mr. caselius.

707
00:48:50,016 --> 00:48:51,784
My orders are simple:

708
00:48:51,818 --> 00:48:54,921
To put the country to rest,
put caselius to rest.

709
00:48:55,688 --> 00:48:58,558
Now, who are you?

710
00:48:58,591 --> 00:49:00,793
Well, let's say we're both
after the same man.

711
00:49:00,827 --> 00:49:02,829
Yeah.

712
00:49:02,862 --> 00:49:05,732
Tough enough to get him
without fighting each other.

713
00:49:05,765 --> 00:49:08,267
Unless, of course,
we work together.

714
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:09,802
Partners?

715
00:49:09,836 --> 00:49:10,903
(Francesca)
Partners.

716
00:49:10,937 --> 00:49:13,540
Once we know
where caselius is

717
00:49:13,573 --> 00:49:17,109
I have some forged papers
that will get us in to him.

718
00:49:17,143 --> 00:49:19,546
We'll all take
turns watching quintana.

719
00:49:19,579 --> 00:49:21,180
The first watch
will be in the morning.

720
00:49:21,213 --> 00:49:23,716
And chuckles can
handle that one.

721
00:49:27,787 --> 00:49:29,622
You don't trust her, do you?

722
00:49:29,656 --> 00:49:31,257
I don't trust any woman.

723
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:32,925
You can drop the act now.

724
00:49:34,894 --> 00:49:35,928
Come on.

725
00:49:35,962 --> 00:49:37,229
I was going to, anyway.

726
00:49:38,765 --> 00:49:40,266
I checked us
out of the motel.

727
00:49:40,299 --> 00:49:42,802
By now quintana's men
must be in the beds,

728
00:49:42,835 --> 00:49:44,771
Under the beds,
and in the closets.

729
00:49:44,804 --> 00:49:47,006
When did you snap out of it?

730
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:48,975
You know that day
on the funny farm,

731
00:49:49,008 --> 00:49:50,810
When that nurse
tried to kill me?

732
00:49:50,843 --> 00:49:54,180
When you walked in that door,
everything came back.

733
00:49:54,213 --> 00:49:56,583
You sure fooled
a lot of people.

734
00:49:56,616 --> 00:49:58,651
That was the idea,
Dr. Watson.

735
00:50:09,261 --> 00:50:10,863
You know how
Mac's mind works.

736
00:50:10,897 --> 00:50:12,999
Never in a straight line.

737
00:50:13,032 --> 00:50:16,803
I had to convince him that
I was 100% normal
only if I were with you.

738
00:50:16,836 --> 00:50:19,138
Then he'd have
to send me back,
and I had to come back.

739
00:50:19,672 --> 00:50:20,907
Why?

740
00:50:21,974 --> 00:50:24,611
To kill caselius.

741
00:50:24,644 --> 00:50:27,680
I tried tonight, with blanks.

742
00:50:27,714 --> 00:50:29,982
That's the lousy
kind of agent I am.

743
00:50:30,016 --> 00:50:32,051
Um, oh, no. You
played your own hand.

744
00:50:32,084 --> 00:50:33,953
For you, not us.

745
00:50:34,921 --> 00:50:36,889
You jumped a gun.

746
00:50:36,923 --> 00:50:38,958
Took a chance
of blowing the whole deal.

747

That's the kind
of a lousy agent you are.

748

Now that I've said that,
and knowing what
I do about caselius,

The next time you
send me off by myself,

Baby, it's cold outside.

Well, now that we're

How did you find me?

974
01:13:05,503 --> 01:13:08,639
The light of
the gracious moon
illumined my path.

975
01:13:08,673 --> 01:13:12,010
Also, I followed Mr. helm.

May a thousand
tigers break every bone
in your body.

01:13:18,016 --> 01:13:20,285
It is a very generous offer.

Mexican cigarettes, Mr. helm?

979
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:39,670
I couldn't find my own brand.

980
01:13:39,704 --> 01:13:43,308
As a matter of fact,
I wouldn't mind an American
cigarette right now.

You made a Picasso out of it.

And you made
something else out of me.

You see, the lady represents

A rather
well-known organization.

Maybe you have heard of it.

She has made
a rather interesting offer
for the saucer, herself.

Just this morning,
I concluded an arrangement

With an oriental gentleman
whose name I cannot pronounce,

1003

For a rather large sum,
which, happily,
I can pronounce.

That the first
man on the moon
would be eating chow mein?

1011
01:15:21,672 --> 01:15:23,674
And if there's 2 of them,
they can have

01:15:23,708 --> 01:15:25,376
Their choice of
egg roll or won ton.

1013

Come, before we go
our several ways.

1014

You're going to
say something rude.

fate of the spy:

Oh, that's class.

you who told him
where he could find me.
