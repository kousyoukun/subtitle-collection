interrupting anything?

No, she's just a masseuse.

everything you want.

electric toothbrush,

brought your mouthwash.

a secret agent

Carrying a coded message
for a foreign power.

The assignment is to uncover
that secret agent

And obtain the coded message.

328
00:20:24,913 --> 00:20:27,816
The marching song of
a secret organization.

329
00:20:27,849 --> 00:20:29,851
A bunch of fanatics
from all over Europe.

330
00:20:29,884 --> 00:20:32,754
Their leader was
a man named caselius.

331
00:20:32,787 --> 00:20:34,956
We thought they'd
gone out of business.

332
00:20:34,989 --> 00:20:36,525
Now they're selling beer.

333
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:39,794
Who is this Mr. montezuma?

334
00:20:39,828 --> 00:20:43,332
He's a millionaire
named quintana.

335
00:20:43,365 --> 00:20:46,768
Lives in acapulco.
His real name is chibnik.

337
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,972
As far as we know

338
00:20:51,005 --> 00:20:54,743
He hasn't been doing
any fooling around down there,
you know, except with beer.

339
00:20:55,377 --> 00:20:56,878
No fooling around?

You don't tell
me these 2 dames

their singing.

342
00:21:00,982 --> 00:21:04,686
Matt, how would you like
to take Mr. quintana's
picture?

343
00:21:04,719 --> 00:21:07,789
You know, do a big spread
on him and the brewery

344
00:21:07,822 --> 00:21:10,359

I don't know.
Is the beer any good?

We've already set it up.

347
00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:17,399
There are 2 tickets
on the 11:00
plane for acapulco.

348
00:21:17,432 --> 00:21:18,633
2 tickets?

349
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:20,068
Sheila's going with you.

350
00:21:20,101 --> 00:21:21,470
No chance.

351
00:21:21,503 --> 00:21:23,438
Matt, she thinks
you're her husband.

352
00:21:23,472 --> 00:21:25,874
As long as she's with you,
she's all right.

353
00:21:25,907 --> 00:21:27,008
And she can help.

354
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,943
Help?

355
00:21:28,977 --> 00:21:32,080
The last thing I need
is a dame around me
who thinks she's my wife.

356
00:21:32,113 --> 00:21:34,383
You know how I operate.

357
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:37,852
Matt, somewhere there's a man
who treated that
girl like an animal.

358
00:21:37,886 --> 00:21:40,054
Some way, she's going to
see him again.

359
00:21:40,088 --> 00:21:41,790
And when she does

360
00:21:41,823 --> 00:21:43,592
We'll know
who's got what we want

361
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,527
And how we can get it back.

362
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,961
I'm not going to do it.

363
00:21:46,995 --> 00:21:48,997
Yes, you are going to do it.

364
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:51,032
There's no other way.

365
00:21:51,065 --> 00:21:52,934
Because wherever
that saucer is,

366
00:21:52,967 --> 00:21:55,637
The only one who can
fly it out of there is Sheila.

367
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:57,806
Do you want to know why?

368
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:00,008
Before setting up
this last flight,

369
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:02,944
They ran
a series of lab tests
on a variety of animals.

370
00:22:02,977 --> 00:22:05,046
They all came out the same.

371
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:07,482
The females lived,
the males died.

372
00:22:09,418 --> 00:22:10,885
What were they doing?

373
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:13,388
Matt, don't you understand?

374
00:22:13,422 --> 00:22:18,026
An electromagnetic field
has a very strange effect
on the male of the species:

375
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:21,396
It kills them, dead.

376
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,865
I now pronounce
me man and wife.

ever arrange it?

I just told Mac
right straight out.

do this magazine job
in Mexico.

382
00:22:51,092 --> 00:22:54,696
And now,
no assignment for i.C.E.
Till we get back.

383
00:22:54,729 --> 00:22:56,565
Is the magazine
the only reason?

00:45:36,824 --> 00:45:38,391
How about your skin?

651
00:45:38,425 --> 00:45:39,927
I just drank the antidote.

652
00:45:44,832 --> 00:45:47,935
Ah, that's right, baby.
Get angry, get angry.

653
00:45:47,968 --> 00:45:50,503
That increases the heart beat
and speeds up the drug.

654
00:45:50,537 --> 00:45:52,439
Speed it up all the way.

655
00:46:10,958 --> 00:46:12,893
Where is caselius?

656
00:46:14,094 --> 00:46:16,897
Where is caselius?

657
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:18,298
Caselius,

658
00:46:18,331 --> 00:46:21,001
I don't... i don't know, oh.

659
00:46:21,034 --> 00:46:22,269
The girl, what?

660
00:46:22,302 --> 00:46:23,336
What girl?

661
00:46:24,304 --> 00:46:25,572
Francesca.

662
00:46:26,339 --> 00:46:28,175
Francesca.

663
00:46:28,208 --> 00:46:29,609
What about her?

664
00:46:29,642 --> 00:46:32,445
Beautiful, beautiful. Oh.

665
00:46:32,479 --> 00:46:34,948

666
00:46:34,982 --> 00:46:36,516
I'd like to...

667
00:46:36,549 --> 00:46:39,887
She likes you, too, baby.
She likes you a lot.

668
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:40,520
Hmm.

669
00:46:42,055 --> 00:46:43,556
You want to make it with her?

670
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:45,058
Oh.

671
00:46:45,092 --> 00:46:46,860
You just tell her
what she wants to hear.

672
00:46:46,894 --> 00:46:48,295
Beautiful.

673
00:46:48,328 --> 00:46:51,932
That is not bad,
but you can do even better.

674
00:46:51,965 --> 00:46:53,633
She's built like a...

675
00:46:53,666 --> 00:46:56,970
That's not what
she wants to hear.

676
00:46:57,004 --> 00:46:59,339
Tell her where is caselius.

677
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:03,510
I'll kill him. I'll kill him.

678
00:47:03,543 --> 00:47:07,414
I want to kill him, too,
but I have to find him first.

679
00:47:07,447 --> 00:47:09,249
So tell me where he is.

680
00:47:10,951 --> 00:47:12,285
Guadalajara?

681
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,421
Tecate?

682
00:47:16,589 --> 00:47:19,659
Mexico city?
Am I getting warm?

683
00:47:19,692 --> 00:47:23,030
Oh, very warm. Very warm.

684
00:47:23,063 --> 00:47:24,898
Hold it right there.

685
00:47:26,199 --> 00:47:28,035
Where?

686
00:47:28,068 --> 00:47:30,103
Get him out of it, fast.

687
00:47:32,339 --> 00:47:35,408
I can bring him to,
if that's what you mean.

688
00:47:35,442 --> 00:47:37,244
That's what I mean.

689

(Matt)
Francesca.

690
00:47:49,322 --> 00:47:52,025
Francesca, phew.

691
00:47:52,059 --> 00:47:53,360
What a girl.

692
00:48:08,341 --> 00:48:10,210
How'd you find me?

693
00:48:10,243 --> 00:48:12,279
I remembered
about her homeland.

694
00:48:14,247 --> 00:48:17,250
To think some guys complain
about jealous wives.

695
00:48:20,387 --> 00:48:22,522
Were you watching
for a long time?

696
00:48:23,423 --> 00:48:24,958
A long time.

697
00:48:24,992 --> 00:48:25,993
Did I have fun?

698
00:48:26,693 --> 00:48:27,995
Wow.

699
00:48:28,561 --> 00:48:30,597
That's "wow"?

700
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:33,333
Oh, I do vaguely
remember one thing.

701
00:48:33,366 --> 00:48:34,667
Yes?

702
00:48:34,701 --> 00:48:37,037
I seem to recall
you saying something

703
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:39,439
About getting rid of
caselius yourself. True?

704
00:48:39,472 --> 00:48:42,175
Why?

705
00:48:42,209 --> 00:48:47,080
A certain country
is undergoing
some political unrest

706
00:48:47,114 --> 00:48:49,482
Thanks to Mr. caselius.

707
00:48:49,516 --> 00:48:51,284
My orders are simple:

708
00:48:51,318 --> 00:48:54,421
To put the country to rest,
put caselius to rest.

709
00:48:55,188 --> 00:48:58,058
Now, who are you?

710
00:48:58,091 --> 00:49:00,293
Well, let's say we're both
after the same man.

711
00:49:00,327 --> 00:49:02,329
Yeah.

712
00:49:02,362 --> 00:49:05,232
Tough enough to get him
without fighting each other.

713
00:49:05,265 --> 00:49:07,767
Unless, of course,
we work together.

714
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,302
Partners?

715
00:49:09,336 --> 00:49:10,403
(Francesca)
Partners.

716
00:49:10,437 --> 00:49:13,040
Once we know
where caselius is

717
00:49:13,073 --> 00:49:16,609
I have some forged papers
that will get us in to him.

718
00:49:16,643 --> 00:49:19,046
We'll all take
turns watching quintana.

719
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:20,680
The first watch
will be in the morning.

720
00:49:20,713 --> 00:49:23,216
And chuckles can
handle that one.

721
00:49:27,287 --> 00:49:29,122
You don't trust her, do you?

722
00:49:29,156 --> 00:49:30,757
I don't trust any woman.

723
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:32,425
You can drop the act now.

724
00:49:34,394 --> 00:49:35,428
Come on.

725
00:49:35,462 --> 00:49:36,729
I was going to, anyway.

726
00:49:38,265 --> 00:49:39,766
I checked us
out of the motel.

727
00:49:39,799 --> 00:49:42,302
By now quintana's men
must be in the beds,

728
00:49:42,335 --> 00:49:44,271
Under the beds,
and in the closets.

729
00:49:44,304 --> 00:49:46,506
When did you snap out of it?

730
00:49:46,539 --> 00:49:48,475
You know that day
on the funny farm,

731
00:49:48,508 --> 00:49:50,310
When that nurse
tried to kill me?

732
00:49:50,343 --> 00:49:53,680
When you walked in that door,
everything came back.

733
00:49:53,713 --> 00:49:56,083
You sure fooled
a lot of people.

734
00:49:56,116 --> 00:49:58,151
That was the idea,
Dr. Watson.

735
00:50:08,761 --> 00:50:10,363
You know how
Mac's mind works.

736
00:50:10,397 --> 00:50:12,499
Never in a straight line.

737
00:50:12,532 --> 00:50:16,303
I had to convince him that
I was 100% normal
only if I were with you.

738
00:50:16,336 --> 00:50:18,638
Then he'd have
to send me back,
and I had to come back.

739
00:50:19,172 --> 00:50:20,407
Why?

740
00:50:21,474 --> 00:50:24,111
To kill caselius.

741
00:50:24,144 --> 00:50:27,180
I tried tonight, with blanks.

742
00:50:27,214 --> 00:50:29,482
That's the lousy
kind of agent I am.

743
00:50:29,516 --> 00:50:31,551
Um, oh, no. You
played your own hand.

744
00:50:31,584 --> 00:50:33,453
For you, not us.

745
00:50:34,421 --> 00:50:36,389
You jumped a gun.

746
00:50:36,423 --> 00:50:38,458
Took a chance
of blowing the whole deal.

747

That's the kind
of a lousy agent you are.

748

Now that I've said that,
and knowing what
I do about caselius,

749
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:49,136

The next time you
send me off by myself,

Ah, quintana's a big man.

Baby, it's cold outside.

Well, now that we're

I'll sleep on the other side.

How did you find me?

974
01:13:05,003 --> 01:13:08,139
The light of
the gracious moon
illumined my path.

975
01:13:08,173 --> 01:13:11,510
Also, I followed Mr. helm.

01:13:11,543 --> 01:13:14,813
May a thousand
tigers break every bone
in your body.

977
01:13:17,516 --> 01:13:19,785
It is a very generous offer.

978
01:13:34,666 --> 01:13:37,002
Mexican cigarettes, Mr. helm?

979
01:13:37,035 --> 01:13:39,170
I couldn't find my own brand.

980
01:13:39,204 --> 01:13:42,808
As a matter of fact,
I wouldn't mind an American
cigarette right now.

You made a Picasso out of it.

And you made
something else out of me.

You see, the lady represents

A rather
well-known organization.

Maybe you have heard of it.

She has made
a rather interesting offer
for the saucer, herself.

Then we shall be bidding
against each other.

Just this morning,
I concluded an arrangement

1002

With an oriental gentleman
whose name I cannot pronounce,

1003
01:14:49,307 --> 01:14:53,745
For a rather large sum,
which, happily,
I can pronounce.

That the first
man on the moon
would be eating chow mein?

1011
01:15:21,172 --> 01:15:23,174
And if there's 2 of them,
they can have

1012
01:15:23,208 --> 01:15:24,876
Their choice of
egg roll or won ton.

1013

Come, before we go
our several ways.

1014

You're going to
say something rude.

The traditional
fate of the spy:
The firing squad.

Oh, that's class.

you who told him
where he could find me.
