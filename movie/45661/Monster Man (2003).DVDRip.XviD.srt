1
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:04,929
( Panting )

2
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:33,455
( grunting )

3
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,468
<i>This love</i>?

4
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,484
<i>This love</i>?

5
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:06,589
<i>This love</i>?

6
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,595
<i>Is a love like no other, no, no</i>?

7
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:12,131
<i>No, I don't want another...</i>?

8
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:19,200
<i>It would be,</i>
<i>it would be, it would be</i>?

9
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:22,299
<i>It would be this love</i>?

10
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:26,142
<i>Is a love like no other...</i>?

11
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,128
Die, die.

12
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:51,396
( laughing ) I got you, Adam.

13
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,634
- Harley?!
- Talk about skid marks?

14
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,438
I bet the ones on the roads
aren't the only ones around.

15
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,445
That was not funny!

16
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:02,875
So you're off
to Betty Ann McAllistor's wedding.

17
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,918
I just wanted to come along.

18
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:07,476
- No way.
- Oh, yes way. I'm coming.

19
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:09,419
No! No, you're not.
You can...

20
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,116
You can hitch a ride back
for all I care.

21
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,556
- Oh, yeah?
- <i>Yeah!</i>

22
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:16,084
- Is that your final decision?
- Yes.

23
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:24,863
Ow, ow, ow!
Ow, ow, ow!

24
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:27,270
( laughing )
Ow, ow, ow! Ow, ow, ow!

25
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,467
You are such a bastard
with those tittie-twisters, man.

26
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,207
Oh, Adam, come on, man.

27
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:37,716
Let me in, Adam.
It'll be like old times, buddy.

28
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:39,752
- Forget it, Harley.
- Oh come on,

29
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,415
- this trip will let us patch things up.
- That bus has already left town.

30
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,458
We're never gonna be friends again.

31
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:49,658
( Harley laughs )

32
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,029
You still keep your spare
in your magnetic hide-a-key.

33
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,967
You are so predictable!

34
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:58,800
Uh-uh, that's mine, baby.

35
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,870
Harley: I never liked Betty Ann.
You know why?

36
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:05,878
'Cause she was
a major prick tease, dude.

37
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:07,914
You were friends with her
for over 10 years,

38
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:10,074
and not once did she consider you
as a boyfriend.

39
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,981
I know that's what you wanted.

40
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:17,723
Hey, what are you doing?
Come on!

41
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,759
( Harley laughs )

42
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:22,595
Just what I suspected, bro'.

43
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,721
You still keep her picture
in your pocket.

44
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:28,029
And it's laminated, even, man.

45
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,331
- You're such a wussy.
- I'm not a wussy, okay?

46
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:33,100
And you have no idea what
my relationship with Betty Ann is like.

47
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:36,006
Oh, I do. And I'm a lot deeper
than you think.

48
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:38,135
I'm an anthropology major,
you know, bro'?

49
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:41,180
Yeah, for seven and a half years.
You haven't learned anything.

50
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:44,843
I have too. If I was an anthropologist
200 years in the future,

51
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:46,647
and I came across your car,
I would still

52
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,348
- deduce that you were a wussy.
- Okay, and how would you do that?

53
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:51,948
First of all, I would conclude
that you're overly cautious.

54
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,357
'Cause not only do you have

55
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:56,726
a Club for your steering wheel,

56
00:04:56,797 --> 00:05:00,255
but you also have Lowjack as evidenced
by the beeper on your key chain.

57
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:03,598
It's for security purposes
and it protects my car.

58
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,935
And most guys use a little black book
to write babes' numbers in.

59
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:09,237
You, however,
use your little black book

60
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,641
to keep track
of your car's gas mileage.

61
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:15,272
I've got a babe's number in there,
if you just look in the Bs.

62
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,942
You write it all down
with this itty bitty little pencil

63
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:19,986
'cause you're too cheap
to buy a new one.

64
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:24,546
And what kind of person
puts one of these on their antenna?

65
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:28,151
- A little wussy, that's who.
- That's it.

66
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,091
<i>Okay...</i>

67
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,928
That's right, I wanna hear it.
I'm not a wussy.

68
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,264
- No way.
- I'm not gonna let you out,

69
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,304
- until you say it.
- I'm not gonna say it.

70
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:41,738
- I'm not a little wussy.
- No, you're a wussy.

71
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:45,340
I'm not letting you out
until you say it, Harley.

72
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:47,972
- Okay, you're not a little wussy.
- Right.

73
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,579
( Coughs )

74
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,846
You're not a wussy, man.

75
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,785
You're not a little wussy.

76
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,120
You are a complete wussy.

77
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,252
Look, Adam, all I'm trying to say

78
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:03,922
is that after all the term papers
you ghost wrote for Betty Ann

79
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:05,828
and all the finals
you prepped her for,

80
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:08,424
she not once unclamped
her knobby little knees for you,

81
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:10,470
let alone let you make out with her.

82
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:13,438
Just admit it, man.
She used you.

83
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,642
She did not use me.

84
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,507
She just...

85
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:43,999
That was weird.

86
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,470
Yeah.

87
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,547
Yeah, Adam, let's get serious.

88
00:06:56,616 --> 00:07:00,177
You know a girl's pubic hair
is really like her hood ornament?

89
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,312
<i>How she shaves her vagifro says a lot</i>

90
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:04,482
<i>about what she's got under the hood.</i>

91
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:07,391
But if her little sex goatee
is perfectly manicured

92
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,226
into a little caterpillar
or a cute little butterfly,

93
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:13,391
like, I bet this girl's done...

94
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:16,924
<i>Whoo, boy, telling you she's got</i>
<i>a lot of horsepower under that hood,</i>

95
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:19,767
and she's gonna be one sweet ride.

96
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,534
Man, you're too much.

97
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,477
I can't believe I let you come along
on this trip with me.

98
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,639
Good God.

99
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:33,949
Hey, this is
a choice opportunity, all right?

100
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,011
We stopped being pals over Betty Ann.

101
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:38,080
I thought that now
that she was getting hitched

102
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:40,285
you'd be over her
and maybe we could start over.

103
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,056
You know, this road trip, I thought,
would be the trick.

104
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,893
- Tell a few jokes, have a few laughs.
- I don't know, man.

105
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,662
It's a little hard getting over
being punched in the face

106
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,896
- by your best friend.
- You called me a liar.

107
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,735
- You called Betty Ann a slut.
- She is.

108
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,139
The skank can deep throat
a garden hose.

109
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,473
The bitch was humping
everybody, but you.

110
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:00,604
Look, I just didn't want you
to get hurt, man.

111
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,706
Right, right. Well, then
you shouldn't have punched me.

112
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:08,244
Harley:
<i>L am in awe, I am in utter awe.</i>

113
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,448
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

114
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:14,425
The forces of stupidity are far greater
than the forces of intelligence.

115
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:18,260
<i>We're outnumbered, Adam.</i>
<i>We are severely outnumbered.</i>

116
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,459
Now look at this, look at these
pea brain watching this crap.

117
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:23,900
Could you just kind
of keep it down a little bit?

118
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,961
Harley:
<i>These rednecks must have an I.Q.</i>

119
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:29,065
the same number
as my underwear size to enjoy this.

120
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,167
I don't really think
it's such a good idea

121
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,406
to use the phrase redneck
in a place like this.

122
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:37,279
Okay, okay.

123
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,784
How are these hillbillies
ever gonna change

124
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,048
<i>unless someone points out</i>
<i>how lame ass they are.</i>

125
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:45,216
You owe me $12.63 for the meal.

126
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:48,261
They have got to know that watching
a monster truck exhibition

127
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:50,990
is just as bad as buying
a velvet painting of Elvis.

128
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,299
Is there any way I can get you
to just shut up?

129
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,959
If a vehicle could take Viagra,

130
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,970
<i>a monster truck</i>
<i>is what it would look like.</i>

131
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:01,667
Those giant tires make the truck look
like it's got blue balls.

132
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,766
- <i>And another thing...</i>
<i>- ( Velcro ripping )</i>

133
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,834
( Velcro ripping )

134
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:11,550
What?

135
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,051
I'm speechless.

136
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:26,064
Did you know that you suffer
from diarrhea of the mouth?

137
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:29,565
Oh, back there at the diner.

138
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:32,366
Yeah, I was just having
a few shits and grins.

139
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:34,805
Yeah, well you totally pissed
those people off, man.

140
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:37,001
They looked like they were
gonna pummel us.

141
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,739
You know, you haven't changed one bit
since you roomed in college.

142
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:45,176
You secretly like having me around
'cause you know I'm good for you.

143
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,048
How is that?

144
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,145
You live vicariously through me.

145
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:51,622
If it weren't for me,
"Dr. Maestro Sir,"

146
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,524
you wouldn't know the first thing
about free style orifice probing.

147
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:58,394
Your entire sexual knowledge is based
on listening to my experiences,

148
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:01,457
which I kindly give you the blow
by blow, if you know what I mean.

149
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:02,865
Hey, stop that.

150
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,111
And I call you on all
the swishy stuff you do.

151
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,342
- Swishy?
- Yeah, swishy. Like that.

152
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:20,215
- Like what?
- You just used your turn signal

153
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,619
to pass a piece of road kill and there's
not a goddamned car in sight.

154
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,749
Shut up.

155
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:34,033
You're 25 and you never done it.

156
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,763
You never even tried.
You're still a fucking virgin.

157
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:41,102
Fucking virgin?
Isn't that an oxymoron?

158
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:44,234
No, man, it's just plain moron.

159
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,278
Just admit it, man.
You never done it.

160
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:50,009
Never done the dirty deed.
Never conjugated the verb.

161
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,074
You never made the beast
with two backs.

162
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,120
It's not what you think.

163
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:56,678
It's not what you think?
You remind me of the guy

164
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:59,816
with the skull-and-bones full-body
tattoo caught in the crack house

165
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:02,589
with his buck naked, shaved pussy,
skinhead teenage girlfriend.

166
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,222
He's got blow up his nose,
needle sticking out of his arms,

167
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:08,927
a cache of uzies next to his KKK
propaganda and child pornography.

168
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,936
The doors are smashed down
and he's caught.

169
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,939
He says to the SWAT team,
"Hey, it's not what you think."

170
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:18,008
Shut up.

171
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:25,982
No, it's because you've been stupidly
saving yourself for Betty Ann.

172
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:28,020
But you're not fooling me, man.

173
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,988
I figured out what lame ass move
you're gonna pull once you see her.

174
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,923
- What are you talking about?
- I know you.

175
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:38,122
You've never told Betty Ann how you
really feel but you've always wanted to.

<i>Now time is running out,</i>

You're gonna have
to declare your love for her

178
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,262
and hope that she drops this dildo
she's about to marry for you.

00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,881
Hey, buddy, you know what this is?

184
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:05,788
It's a flock of these!

185
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:10,194
- Are you nuts?
- The "rum ranger" deserved it, man.

186
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:35,183
- Can't this thing go any faster?
- I got it floored, I got it floored.

187
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:48,991
This can't be happening.

188
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,439
Oh, man, for once maybe you were right,
I shouldn't have flipped him off.

189
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:59,342
Just let him pass us, man.
Just let him pass us.

190
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:01,039
Come on, man, pass us.

191
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:04,447
Okay, okay, pass me.
Come on, pass me.

192
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:07,042
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to flip you off, man.

Oh, oh, God.

Stop it, Adam, stop it.
Stop it or I'm gonna fart on you.

Okay.

210
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,478
That was a wise choice, Kimosabe.

You know I would've.

212

Give it another try, Adam.
We should be able to get this started.

Hey man, was I right?

00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,260
Are you gonna tell Betty Ann
how you really feel?

219
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,035
Yeah.

220
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:40,766
Yeah, I'm gonna tell her I love her.

221
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,241
I don't expect her to leave her guy
for me or anything,

222
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:48,241
but I couldn't live with myself
if I didn't at least try,

223
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:49,941
right?

224
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,877
That's nice.

Just one thing.

Before you tell Betty Ann that,

227
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,925
you better take those tampons
out of your nose.

Come on, man,
stop being such a douche.

How do you know that?

233

Some guys in my contract law class

were in this nasty
drunk driving accident.

235

As a memorial some of my classmates
put up a cross in the road

236
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,352
- and marked where they died.
- Huh.

237

You know those silicone implants they
give to girls when they get boob jobs?

<i>supposed to last forever.</i>

What freaks me out is
when one of these women dies.

240
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:47,731
After a few years her corpse
will totally be rotting in the ground,

241
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:51,004
but her carcass will have
these perfect silicone implants

Can you not be serious for one minute?
That truck ran us off the road.

You really think
he was trying to kill us?

It sure seemed like it, yeah.

248
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,450
It's probably just a redneck
from back in the diner

trying to get us back
for what I said.

No, it seems like more
than just payback.

Just because you're paranoid,
doesn't mean that...

253
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:21,239
doesn't mean
that someone isn't coming after you.

There's no one home.

262
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:47,361
Probably went for a hike
or something...

263
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,458
I guess we could wait here
until they come back.

You got me Adam,

Speaking of which, did you know

that "Citizen Kane" is

How is that?

279
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:19,322
Well, Charles Foster Kane was based
on William Randolph Hearst,

280

the big newspaper magnate.

281
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:24,961
And William Randolph Hearst named
his girlfriend's pussy, her rosebud.

That's why
the biggest line in the movie

Harley, you gotta get down,
he's coming. Let's go.

Let's go!

Shut up, you're so stupid.

He didn't even know we were there.
We were parked on the south side.

00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:17,869
I don't care,
I saw the guy... he is a freak.

We were hidden behind the dumpster.

331
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,334
He had this one eye... it was all white,
it didn't even look human.

Umm, Adam?

334
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:34,045
Was that like that before we stopped
at the gas station?

335
00:27:36,422 --> 00:27:38,583
Oh no, man, now he knows it was us,

336
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,989
he knows it was you
who pissed in his truck.

337

I been waiting my whole life

Congratulations,
you fulfilled your destiny.

339
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,026
- Adam, I gotta tell you something.
- Yeah, what?

340
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,761
I mean I really don't want
to tell you,

341
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,094
but I'd hate to go to my grave
without letting you know.

Okay.

343
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:56,405
I slept with Betty Ann.

344

Aren't you gonna say anything?

345
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:06,885
That's how I knew
she was sleeping around,

346
00:28:06,952 --> 00:28:08,579
and that's why I was badmouthing her.

347
00:28:08,654 --> 00:28:11,052
I wanted you to get over her
so if you found out what I did

348
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:12,752
you might not be quite as mad.

349

Okay, I parked the car around back

00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,525
so no one should know
we're staying here.

353
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:50,357
You know,
I actually think we're in the clear.

354
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:53,921
I mean, the odds of him finding us
are like winning the lottery.

355
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:57,992
We're more likely to find a dead hooker
stuffed in our mattress.

356
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,231
Hey Harley, look at that.

357
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:03,502
Police discovered the body of a man
murdered inside his motor home.

358

No details were released.

359
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:09,143
Police would only comment that it was a
grisly scene inside the camper trailer,

360
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:11,375
<i>and that part of the body</i>

That's the motor home
where we stole the gas.

I know, I know.

367
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:30,959
Oh man, this whole trip
is turning into a nightmare.

368

We're getting chased around
by a madman in a monster truck.

369

We're running around trailer homes
with corpses inside of them.

I found out you slept with Betty Ann.

371
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,672
I don't know what's worse.

372
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:46,047
We gotta call the police.

373
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:48,780
And tell them what,
I sucked in a mouthful of shit?

374
00:29:48,854 --> 00:29:51,789
- We didn't see any of that.
- Harley, we have an obligation.

375
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:54,325
What if they hold us for questioning.

376
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:57,191
There's no way you're gonna get
to Betty Ann before she gets married.

377
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:59,492
We don't know anything
that's gonna help them.

378
00:29:59,565 --> 00:30:02,363
Do you really wanna drive back
into the monster truck's backyard?

379
00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:04,902
I think it's just best that we get
the hell out of Dodge.

380
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:09,600
Oh, oh, do you have
any tweezers, man?

381
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:19,814

Mm, you like that, don't you?
What's that, honey?

You want me to lick your button, huh?

Harley: <i>Oh yeah, great,</i>
<i>that makes me feel a lot better.</i>

Adam:
<i>Oh shit, we got a flat.</i>

412

Look, he got us back.

413
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:48,626
It was pure payback,
that's all it had to be.

414
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,991
If he wanted us dead,
he would've Dahmered with us.

415
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:53,792
You are one bong hit away
from having absolutely no brain cells.

That guy is gonna kill us.

417
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:58,101
He killed the guy in the woods,
and now he's gonna kill us.

418

He's just waiting for the right moment.
I know it. I just know it.

Come on, come on, help me fix this.

420
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:05,609
No way.
I'm not getting out of this car.

421
00:34:05,677 --> 00:34:07,941
I thought you just said
we had nothing to worry about.

422
00:34:08,013 --> 00:34:11,642
Now come on. I'm not going out there
unless you're there with me,

423
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,343
watching my back.

424
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:16,285
Forget it. My ass is in this seat.
It's not going anywhere.

425
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:22,325
If he kills you, can I tell Betty Ann
that I love her?

426
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:26,622
- That's not funny.
- And what if I'm telling you the truth?

427
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,491
What, you love Betty Ann too?

428
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:33,538
Well yeah, you know
our fling wasn't a one-timer.

429
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:36,039
<i>I was pretty tore up</i>
<i>when she broke things off with me.</i>

430
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:38,200
That's why I said
all those bad things about her.

431
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:42,042
This trip has really got me thinking.
I might wanna tell her how I feel.

432
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:44,741
You wanna tell her how you feel?

433
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:46,875
Well after you, of course.

434
00:34:46,952 --> 00:34:48,943
I figure while she's figuring out
her choices,

435
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,988
I might as well throw my name
into the mix.

436
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:54,150
You're unbelievable.

437

( Both scream )

438
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:22,209
Wow, relax guys,
I was just crashing in your car.

439
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,758
Hi, I'm Sarah.

440
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:30,124
Hey, I'm Harley,

441
00:35:30,195 --> 00:35:32,288
and this is my dorky friend Adam.

442
00:35:33,365 --> 00:35:35,333
Hi.

443
00:35:36,668 --> 00:35:38,795
Nice outfits.

444
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,895
Oh yeah.

445
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,074
Oh yeah.

446
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,442
So what were you guys doing

447
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:50,513
in the middle of the night
in your underwear, huh?

448
00:35:50,582 --> 00:35:53,542
Is this some
sort of frat initiation stunt?

449
00:35:54,753 --> 00:35:57,483
Yeah, I guess you could say
it was something like that.

450
00:35:57,555 --> 00:36:00,888
So, where are you headed?

451
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,095
- Anywhere but here.
- And why is that?

452
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:08,232
None of your business.

453
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,791
Oh, mysterious.

454
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:13,064
I like that.

455
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:16,130
Sarah: <i>Your friend</i>
<i>doesn't say much, does he?</i>

456
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:19,472
No, he gets nervous around girls.

457
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:23,512
Well maybe
I like the strong silent type.

458
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:26,141
Well you got the silent part right.

459
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:29,152
You see, he's a virgin.

460
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,313
Huh.

461
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:34,756
And you're what I call an a-hole.

462
00:36:35,961 --> 00:36:39,624
- Hey, do you need some help?
- Oh, I got it, thanks.

463
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:43,058
What?

464
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:45,102
Your eyes...

465
00:36:47,172 --> 00:36:49,367
I like your root beer colored eyes.

466
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:53,502
Oh, root beer colored eyes.

467
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,776
I like that.

468
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:08,192
Man: <i>What's your name, boy?</i>

469
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:11,023
Adam: <i>I told you, officer,</i>
<i>I don't wanna be identified.</i>

470
00:37:11,096 --> 00:37:13,360
- This is an anonymous tip.
- <i>L need your name.</i>

471
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:16,229
- Please just listen.
<i>- All right. What's this about, boy?</i>

472
00:37:16,301 --> 00:37:18,735
Just north of the motor home
where you found the murder,

473
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:20,998
my friend and I were chased off the road

474
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:24,599
by this huge weird monster truck.

475
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:26,837
And it, I mean,

476
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:31,348
who... whoever was driving the vehicle
was trying to kill us.

477
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:34,852
I think the driver of that monster truck
could be your murderer.

478
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:41,353
It's... it's all yours.

479
00:37:48,033 --> 00:37:50,024
Harley, I just called the cops.

480
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:53,366
Look, maybe they'll actually pick up
that guy in the monster truck.

481
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,906
I think we just gotta get to the wedding
as soon as possible.

482
00:37:55,974 --> 00:37:58,067
I have to talk to Betty Ann
before she's married.

483
00:37:58,143 --> 00:38:00,008
Are you sure
that's what you wanna do?

484
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:02,046
You know, this is your big chance.

485
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:05,276
- What?
- You know, with Sarah.

486
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:07,079
This is your moment to lose it.

487
00:38:07,152 --> 00:38:09,518
Pop your cherry, become a man,
you name it.

488
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:13,421
I'm not interested.
I'm really not interested.

489
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:15,823
Oh, I think you're interested big time.

490
00:38:15,894 --> 00:38:18,328
Come on, man, Stop it, stop it.

491
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:21,854
That chick is hot.
And biology is destiny, baby.

492
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:24,902
Biology is destiny.

493
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:28,063
I find it hard to believe she likes me
with you cutting me down at every turn.

494
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,697
It's all a part of my plan.

495
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:32,004
I'm being an a-hole on purpose
so she's gonna hate me

496
00:38:32,077 --> 00:38:34,011
and thereby like you.
It's brilliant.

497
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,546
Oh, okay.

498
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:38,104
Then how do you explain
being an a-hole before she showed up?

499
00:38:38,183 --> 00:38:40,447
I'm telling you, everything
that happened on this trip

500
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:42,247
has happened for a reason.

501
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,221
All the cosmic forces are conspiring
for you to meet this chick.

502
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:46,882
I don't think so.

503
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:50,189
Come on.
This girl digs you.

504
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:52,229
And I'll bet you this chick
does anything.

505
00:38:52,297 --> 00:38:55,789
I'll bet you she'll even give you those
little eyelash butterfly kisses

506
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:59,268
you like so much...
on your balls, even.

507
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:03,034
Man, you know, you just want me
to get interested in this girl

508
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:05,736
because now you've decided
you're in love with Betty Ann, too.

509
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:08,779
Oh, that is not it at all.
Look man, if you're not gonna go for it,

510
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:10,781
I'm gonna have to.

511
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:13,374
She probably likes me better, anyway.

512
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:16,386
- Cut it out.
- Oh man, she'll never even know

513
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:18,149
- I felt her up.
- Harley, don't.

514
00:39:18,223 --> 00:39:20,316
- Come on.
- No.

515
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:23,451
Come on, don't you wanna know
if she's got root beer colored nipples?

516
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:26,463
Okay, well yes, a little bit, but no,
no, no, don't.

517
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:28,260
Harley, Harley.

518
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:31,769
( Harley chuckles )

519
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:35,328
( moaning ) Oh Adam,

520
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:41,375
I love the way you touch me, baby.

521
00:39:42,447 --> 00:39:45,245
I can't believe that.

522
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:58,161
I can't believe that she's more
attracted to you than she is to me.

523
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:01,596
I mean, that's absurd. I mean,
look at you and look at me.

524
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:03,293
Would you just let this go?

525
00:40:03,368 --> 00:40:06,030
I promise you by the end of this trip
she's gonna be mine.

526
00:40:06,104 --> 00:40:08,368
Why are you getting so competitive
all of a sudden?

527
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:10,566
- Because I like her.
- Yeah, well I like her too.

528
00:40:10,642 --> 00:40:12,667
Yeah, but you're not
gonna do anything about it,

529
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:15,941
- so why don't you just step aside?
- Can't you let me have this one thing?

530
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:17,606
She had a dream about me, so what?

531
00:40:17,682 --> 00:40:19,707
So what? It should've been me.

532
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:22,412
Yeah, well it should've been me
who slept with Betty Ann, not you.

533
00:40:22,487 --> 00:40:24,819
Betty Ann didn't sleep with you
because you're a wussy.

534
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:26,720
- I'm not a wussy.
- You are too.

535
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:28,918
- Am not.
- Are too.

536
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:30,824
- Am not, am not.
- Are too, are too.

537
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:32,692
- Am not, am not.
- Are too, are too.

538
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,629
- Am not, am not.
- Are too, are too.

539
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:36,690
What the hell's going on?

540
00:40:41,506 --> 00:40:43,736
Which one of you I'm attracted to?

541
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:46,072
You two are such little boys.

542
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:48,635
I mean, Jesus Christ, you could've
gotten us all killed.

543
00:40:50,715 --> 00:40:53,115
You know what?
I think I'm gonna hitch another ride.

544
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:56,847
Oh that's great, look what you did.
The best thing about this trip was Sarah

545
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:58,684
- and now you made her leave.
- Me?

546
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:00,314
- Yeah, you.
- This is your fault.

547
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:04,384
Sarah, Sarah come back.

548
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:07,192
<i>- Come on, Sarah</i>
- Harley: Come on, Sarah, we're sorry.

549
00:41:07,265 --> 00:41:09,199
<i>- All right, please?</i>
<i>- Sorry.</i>

550
00:41:09,267 --> 00:41:13,101
- I'm sorry, please, come back.
- Please, Sarah.

551
00:41:13,171 --> 00:41:16,197
I'm sorry.

552
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:27,076
<i>( Heavy metal music playing )</i>

553
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:41,130
Wow! Sweet jelly,
she likes me better!

554
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:44,726
Aah... hold, please.

555
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:47,771
Okay, now is your turn, Adam.

556
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,830
What?

557
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:51,704
Your turn to kiss me.

558
00:41:51,776 --> 00:41:54,210
Then I can tell who turns me on more.

559
00:41:54,279 --> 00:41:57,407
We can settle this for good
and be on our merry way.

560
00:41:57,482 --> 00:41:59,609
Oh, I...
I don't know...

561
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,879
I don't think so.

562
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:13,797
<i>( Soft music playing )</i>

563
00:42:35,086 --> 00:42:38,544
That's settles it.
Adam wins.

564
00:42:38,623 --> 00:42:41,319
Oh, that's it! All right?
I call the backseat.

565
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:44,623
This is one bad dream and I just need
to sleep it off, all right?

566
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,807
( Snoring )

567
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:05,340
So, Sarah, where are you headed?

568
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:08,010
Nowhere.

569
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:10,179
No, seriously, where are you going?

570
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:15,586
Look, I don't want to talk about it.

571
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:19,596
Let's just say
I'm leaving my problems behind.

572
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:28,897
I will tell you one secret though.

573
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:34,140
I wasn't sleeping
when you touched me.

574
00:43:35,213 --> 00:43:37,181
What?

575
00:43:37,248 --> 00:43:39,580
But then, why did you let me...

576
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:42,312
oh jeez, I'm really sorry.

577
00:43:42,387 --> 00:43:44,218
I mean, Harley and I
were goofing off...

578
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,880
it's all right.

579
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:49,154
I pretended to dream about you, because
I wanted to teach Harley a lesson.

580
00:43:49,227 --> 00:43:51,718
Same thing with the kissing contest.

581
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:53,991
You wanted to teach him a lesson?

582
00:43:54,065 --> 00:43:55,896
Yeah,

583
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:58,026
I saw how he was treating you.

584
00:43:58,102 --> 00:44:00,366
I wanted to show him that

585
00:44:00,438 --> 00:44:04,238
you don't have to come on
so tetosterony to be a man.

586
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:10,009
Thanks, I guess.

( Loud snoring )

588
00:44:15,453 --> 00:44:18,820
I have another lesson
to teach Harley.

Nothing, I'm just waking you up.

593
00:44:43,281 --> 00:44:45,272
It's Adam's turn for some shut eye.

Sarah: <i>I don't know, why?</i>

597
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,793
To teach women
how to walk on their hind legs.

( Sarah laughs )

599

Guys, this town
isn't even on the map.

600
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:10,401
Sure you didn't take a wrong turn?

Sarah:
<i>Cheers to that.</i>

Look at these yokels.

605

Look at these hillbillies
putting on a pair of socks

606

as their equipment
to putting on a three-pieces suit.

<i>Check out my suave sense of humor.</i>

615
00:46:20,044 --> 00:46:23,411
- ( flatulence )
- ( Laughing ) That's not funny.

616
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:27,809
Would you like to dance,
little old lady?

617
00:46:27,885 --> 00:46:30,319
Oh no, thanks.

618
00:46:30,388 --> 00:46:32,379
No, I think you'd like to dance.

619
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:36,750
You heard the lady.

620
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:40,160
She's not interested.

621
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:45,560
I wasn't talking to you, Pretty boy.

622
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,263
( Screams )

623
00:46:48,606 --> 00:46:53,441
What? Me dancing with this girl
is gonna ruin your ménage á trois?

624
00:46:54,712 --> 00:46:58,739
Hey, let's take this dance
to the back of my truck.

625
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,807
Yeah.

626
00:47:00,885 --> 00:47:02,716
You see these hands?

627
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:06,822
- Now, watch out for my foot.
- ( Grunt )

628
00:47:06,891 --> 00:47:10,224
( Harley cheering ) Whoo!

629
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:12,922
You just got beat up by a girl.

630
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:14,497
Harley:
That guy was such a dick.

631
00:47:16,601 --> 00:47:19,536
He was a big guy, he was a big dick.

632
00:47:19,604 --> 00:47:22,971
I just can't believe
you let Sarah kick his ass.

633
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,737
Adam?
Adam, where did you go?

634
00:47:26,811 --> 00:47:28,938
Here.

635
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:31,038
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

636
00:47:42,927 --> 00:47:46,488
I can't understand
why you're being so nice to me.

637
00:47:46,564 --> 00:47:49,761
It's nice being nice to the nice.

638
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:53,168
I don't know how you can say that,

639
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:55,603
I'm not even man enough to stick up
for the girl I like.

640
00:47:57,642 --> 00:48:00,611
- You like me?
- Yeah.

641
00:48:05,149 --> 00:48:07,344
Then why don't you
do something about it?

642
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,311
What?

643
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:13,823
Do you have a girlfriend?

644
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:15,916
No.

645
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:18,826
Well no, not really.

646
00:48:20,197 --> 00:48:23,098
I heard you and Harley
talking in the car.

647
00:48:23,167 --> 00:48:26,136
It sounds like you really have a thing
for this Betty Ann.

648
00:48:27,505 --> 00:48:29,530
Yeah.

649
00:48:29,607 --> 00:48:34,340
Listen, I'm not looking
for a commitment here.

650
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:36,380
I know.

651
00:48:36,447 --> 00:48:38,938
You know,

652
00:48:39,016 --> 00:48:42,110
a woman likes a man with experience.

653
00:48:42,186 --> 00:48:45,246
Betty Ann might like you better
if you were...

654
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:47,313
a little more worldly.

655
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:50,827
- Really?
- Yes.

656
00:48:50,895 --> 00:48:54,922
So, what are you waiting for?

657
00:48:54,999 --> 00:48:57,092
I'm afraid.

658
00:48:57,168 --> 00:49:00,137
Why? Do you think
that when a woman's the aggressor,

659
00:49:00,204 --> 00:49:03,799
that makes you less of a man.

660
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:06,138
Yeah.

661
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:10,647
Well no, maybe it's not it, anyways.

662
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:14,549
Then what are you afraid of?

663
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:17,678
Everything.

664
00:49:17,755 --> 00:49:19,780
What if I'm not good?

665
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:25,561
Oh, you'll be good.
I know it.

666
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,720
- Oh, I'm sorry...
- What?

667
00:49:59,797 --> 00:50:03,255
My nose bleed... I've been
having it since I was a a kid.

668
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:06,132
It happens pretty easily,
I'm... sorry.

669
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:09,001
Oh, here,

670
00:50:09,073 --> 00:50:12,236
let nurse Sarah take a look at that.

671
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:15,107
( Both chuckle )

672
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,646
You've got a little bit on your face.

673
00:50:25,456 --> 00:50:28,323
Here, let me kiss that
and make it all better.

674
00:50:30,461 --> 00:50:33,157
Mmm.

675
00:50:47,478 --> 00:50:49,446
Is that better?

676
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:52,209
Much.

677
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,777
Are you really a virgin?

678
00:50:56,854 --> 00:50:59,186
Yeah.

679
00:51:01,025 --> 00:51:03,016
I can't believe that...

680
00:51:03,093 --> 00:51:05,323
a handsome guy like you.

681
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:09,127
( laughs ) it's true.

682
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:13,830
You swear?

683
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:17,203
Yeah, I swear.

684

685
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:22,337
That really turns me on.

Whoo!

687
00:51:35,726 --> 00:51:37,694

Make me come now.

00:51:57,348 --> 00:51:59,509
Okay, can we try.

696
00:52:00,651 --> 00:52:04,883
Do or do not, there is no trying.

697
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:06,616
Huh?

698

It's definitely not Colonel Mustard
in the study with a candlestick.

- Sarah, wait!
- Oh, hell's bells.

You dang kids are up to your assholes

Ask the elbows what?

We can't find a dang thing.

No, Sir, we saw that.
I swear it.

You know what I think?

727
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:15,538
I think you're all pulling
some dang prank.

728
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:17,409
I got a holler from upstate

00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:20,348
about a couple of boys
fitting your description.

730
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:24,046
You left a piece of dang road kill
in a motel room,

731
00:55:24,121 --> 00:55:26,715
thinking it was pretty dang funny.

732
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:31,591
I got half a mind to haul you in
for wasting my time.

733
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:34,927
We're not lying.
We saw the whole dang thing.

734
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:43,199
You angling to get in on some
drop the soap action, boy?

735
00:55:43,273 --> 00:55:45,400
'Cause if you are,

736
00:55:45,476 --> 00:55:49,139
I'll put you in with a whole cell
of hardy hard-ons.

737
00:55:49,213 --> 00:55:53,343
They'll stretch your ass out
till it looks like a spare tire.

738
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:56,011
My advice to you

739
00:55:56,086 --> 00:56:00,523
is to get in your dang car
and get the hell out of my state

740
00:56:00,591 --> 00:56:04,391
before I put you in a place
where your nicknames will be

741
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:07,988
Firestone and Uniroyal.

742
00:56:13,003 --> 00:56:16,530
So, this guy in a monster truck
has been following you for two days?

You got it, sister.

744
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:21,139
Boy, did I hitch a ride
with the wrong car.

745
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:24,174
What are you doing, dude?

746
00:56:24,248 --> 00:56:26,113
I think I took a wrong turn.

747
00:56:26,183 --> 00:56:28,981
Well, this is a perfect place
for old fuck face to nail us.

748
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:32,215
- Fuck face.
- Yeah, you saw the guy.

749
00:56:32,289 --> 00:56:34,052
His face was totally fucked up.

750
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:36,319
Looked like someone
quilted his face together.

751
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:38,020
Wired his jaw shut, too.

752
00:56:38,095 --> 00:56:40,393
So yeah, he's fuck face in my book,
so come on, let's go.

753
00:56:40,464 --> 00:56:43,729
Look, I can't turn back around.
Deputy Dang will throw us behind bars.

754
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,166
If we go this way,
we could run right into fuck face.

755
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,636
Look, I'm not going anywhere
until we check the map.

756
00:57:00,884 --> 00:57:03,352
Come on, make a decision,
make a decision.

757
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:06,389
- Give him a second.
- Oh yeah, that's just great.

758
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:09,391
Gang up on me now that you
and Studmeister General here

759
00:57:09,459 --> 00:57:11,222
have taken your male
and female juices

760
00:57:11,295 --> 00:57:14,924
and mixed them all together into
a flagrant smorgasbord of bodily soup.

761
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:18,593
- Great.
- Flagrant smorgasbord?

762

- What?
- You are next.

765
00:57:29,646 --> 00:57:32,171
Well, that's what it says
on your hood.

766
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:36,051
See?

767
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:38,553
You are next.

768

Even if that weren't on your hood,

769
00:57:41,992 --> 00:57:45,223
I'd tell you folks you shouldn't be
stopped out here on this road.

770
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:47,490
No siree Bob,

771
00:57:47,564 --> 00:57:50,499
not with the demon out there.

772
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:52,660
What demon?

773
00:57:52,736 --> 00:57:57,036
The demon that did this to my arm.

774
00:57:58,508 --> 00:58:00,669
Look how he butchered me.

775
00:58:00,744 --> 00:58:02,541
What happened?

776
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:05,343
Oh, yo, fuck that!

777
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:12,212
I was out hunting,
I was aiming at a deer,

778
00:58:12,289 --> 00:58:15,554
laying as still
as my granddaddy in his casket,

779
00:58:15,626 --> 00:58:19,027
when I feels this cold shadow
come over me.

780
00:58:19,096 --> 00:58:21,690
So I take a look see.

781
00:58:21,765 --> 00:58:25,326
And there's a man,
he's as big as a tree.

782
00:58:25,402 --> 00:58:29,862
His face is a patchwork
of skin and stitches.

783
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:34,240
I calls him demon because
he's the scariest thing I ever seen,

784
00:58:35,646 --> 00:58:37,978
and nothing human
could be that strong.

785
00:58:38,048 --> 00:58:41,074
He lifts me up like I was nothing.

786
00:58:41,151 --> 00:58:45,053
Knocks my head
against a tree limb, and I'm out.

787
00:58:45,122 --> 00:58:49,582
When I wakes up
I'm still in the woods,

788
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:53,027
but my arm's been sawed off.

789
00:58:54,131 --> 00:58:55,758
<i>It's true.</i>

790
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:59,598
It's happened to dozens others
the exact same way.

791
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:02,730
Most of us too poor to leave.

792
00:59:02,806 --> 00:59:04,603
Me?

793
00:59:04,675 --> 00:59:07,109
I ain't afraid of him no more.

794
00:59:07,177 --> 00:59:10,271
He wanted to kill me,
he would have done and done it.

795
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:15,584
No, he's through with me.
He needs fresh meat.

796
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:18,086
Fresh meat, I tell you.

797
00:59:18,155 --> 00:59:19,782
So take my advice.

798
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:23,292
You best not mosey
along this road, you hear?

799
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,885
You heard him,
let's not mosey along this road.

800
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:29,420
- Yeah.
- Good day, folks.

801
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:31,729
Good day.

802
00:59:35,806 --> 00:59:37,865
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh, what?

803
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:39,704
I don't wanna freak you out
or anything,

804
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:41,676
- but we're almost out of gas.
- Sarah: <i>What?</i>

805
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:44,578
- How can we almost get out of gas?
- I don't know. The needle dropped.

806
00:59:44,648 --> 00:59:46,809
- It must've been sticking.
- Oh, this is not good.

807
00:59:46,883 --> 00:59:49,943
- This is not good at all.
- Guys, what's that?

808
00:59:51,221 --> 00:59:54,213
- Adam: <i>it's just a scarecrow.</i>
- If it is, well...

809
00:59:54,291 --> 00:59:56,418
Why isn't it protecting
some farmer's cornfield

810
00:59:56,493 --> 00:59:59,360
instead of standing there
in the middle of the road?

811
01:00:22,586 --> 01:00:25,680
- What are you doing?
- I'm making a pact with God.

812
01:00:25,756 --> 01:00:28,316
If he spares us,
I promise not to be an A-hole anymore.

813
01:00:28,392 --> 01:00:31,623
- <i>( Thud, )</i>
- Oh, Jeez, on the road.

814
01:00:31,695 --> 01:00:34,562
( Screaming )

815
01:00:39,503 --> 01:00:42,597
- How you doing?
- ( All laugh )

816
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:56,976
This road is really creeping me out.

817
01:00:58,221 --> 01:01:01,713
Hey guys, guys, look.
Check it out.

818
01:01:01,792 --> 01:01:04,317
<i>All right,</i>
<i>it looks like they got gas.</i>

819
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:10,766
<i>Hey Sarah, let me show you</i>
<i>what I can really do with my mouth.</i>

820
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:13,234
<i>Check it out.</i>

821
01:01:13,303 --> 01:01:15,271
Sarah:
<i>Jesus, slow down.</i>

822
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:17,169
You're gonna get brain freeze.

823
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:24,404
( Belching )

824
01:01:24,481 --> 01:01:26,415
Oh, that hits the spot.

825
01:01:28,318 --> 01:01:30,513
You know that soda
contains a lot of fructose?

826
01:01:30,587 --> 01:01:33,988
- Yeah, so?
- Well did you that 95%%%

827
01:01:34,057 --> 01:01:36,685
of a man's ejaculate is fructose?

828
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,421
It's totally true.

829
01:01:39,463 --> 01:01:42,330
- Well, what are you trying to say?
- ( Laughs )

830
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:46,999
Hey, you know, I don't think
I like what you're implying there.

831
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:48,765
Oh, food's here.

832
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:54,900
Oh, thank you so much.

833
01:01:54,978 --> 01:01:58,846
So, how do things with you and Sarah
affect the way you feel about Betty Ann?

834
01:01:58,915 --> 01:02:01,383
( Sighs ) I don't know.

835
01:02:01,451 --> 01:02:04,284
You know, I got another day
before we get to the wedding.

836
01:02:04,354 --> 01:02:05,981
I hope to figure it out before then.

837
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:08,616
Well, whatever you decide man,
I'm behind you.

838
01:02:08,692 --> 01:02:11,456
You know, if you go for Betty Ann,
more power to you.

839
01:02:11,528 --> 01:02:15,362
If you decide on Sarah,
well, that's cool too.

840
01:02:17,834 --> 01:02:19,961
I'm really sorry
about everything I did, man.

841
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:24,336
You know, I'm the type of guy
who puts the "ick" in the word dick.

842
01:02:34,351 --> 01:02:38,811
Okay, guys, there's nothing that a bowl
of chili and a hamburger can't fix.

843
01:02:40,023 --> 01:02:41,650
<i>Mmm.</i>

844
01:02:44,895 --> 01:02:48,058
All right guys, from now on
we stop only for gas.

845
01:02:48,131 --> 01:02:51,464
Drive straight through.
If I get tired, we'll switch off.

846
01:02:58,975 --> 01:03:01,944
( Gagging )

847
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:17,124
Oh, dude,
I think you just ate somebody.

848
01:03:20,163 --> 01:03:22,791
Oh, this is not good,
this is not good!

849
01:03:22,866 --> 01:03:24,697
( Screaming )

850
01:03:27,504 --> 01:03:29,904
Harley, come on.

851
01:03:37,914 --> 01:03:41,509
Adam: <i>I can't believe that happened.</i>
<i>There were people in my chili.</i>

852
01:03:41,585 --> 01:03:43,177
- ( panting )
<i>- An eyeball!</i>

853
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:49,391
- I can't believe what just happened.
- Goddamm it, I ate somebody.

854
01:03:49,459 --> 01:03:52,360
There's a dead guy in the back seat.

855
01:03:52,429 --> 01:03:54,090
( Screaming )

856
01:03:56,766 --> 01:03:58,393
Oh, God!

857
01:03:59,803 --> 01:04:01,634
Jesus.

858
01:04:01,705 --> 01:04:05,038
- Get it out of here, Adam.
- You're in the back, you get rid of it.

859
01:04:05,108 --> 01:04:07,599
It's your car, "major domo,"
you get rid of it.

860
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:15,947
Oh shit, it's fuck face.

861
01:04:19,723 --> 01:04:21,520
We're all gonna die.

862
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:25,118
I definitely hitched a ride
with the wrong car.

863
01:04:32,669 --> 01:04:35,160
I can't outrun it.

864
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:45,344
- Do something, Adam, do something!
- I'm open to suggestions.

865
01:05:03,433 --> 01:05:06,493
Adam, hurry,
that guy is gonna kill us.

866
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:25,846
<i>( All screaming )</i>

- ( engine whines )
- Come on.

869
01:05:47,577 --> 01:05:50,045
Adam, hurry, start the car now.

870
01:05:50,113 --> 01:05:53,241
- It's not starting.
- ( Whimpering )

871
01:05:53,316 --> 01:05:56,080
- ( screaming )
- Just start it.

872
01:05:56,152 --> 01:05:58,143
( Screaming )

873
01:05:59,222 --> 01:06:03,249
Sarah: <i>Get it started,</i>
<i>he's coming, oh my God!</i>

874
01:06:06,696 --> 01:06:10,097
What's going on, what's going on,
what's going on?

875
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:12,896
( Screams ) Let me out!

876
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:15,335
Run Harley.

877
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,670
( Screaming )

878
01:06:32,122 --> 01:06:33,749
Harley.

879
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:35,814
( Harley screams, whimpers )

880
01:06:37,427 --> 01:06:38,587
Come on, Harley.

881
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:41,596
I'm a corpse burrito, dude.

882
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:43,962
- We're gonna get you out of here.
- We'll get you out.

883
01:06:45,935 --> 01:06:47,664
- Come on.
- Try wiggling.

884
01:06:47,737 --> 01:06:50,570
- I am wiggling.
- Wiggle more.

885
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,608
- Wiggle.
- Wiggle, come on.

886
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:54,302
He's coming around again.

887
01:06:56,379 --> 01:06:58,973
- What are you doing?
- I'm bringing the dead guy close,

888
01:06:59,048 --> 01:07:01,812
- so I can get Harley out.
- That's fucked up, but okay.

889
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:05,449

I can't run anymore.
I can't do it.

- Do you think we lost him?
- Yeah, sure.

01:15:20,583 --> 01:15:22,517
Give me the shovel.

931
01:15:22,585 --> 01:15:24,212
( laughing )

932
01:15:36,232 --> 01:15:38,291
( laughing )

933
01:15:40,036 --> 01:15:41,731
Man:
<i>Welcome friend.</i>

934
01:15:41,804 --> 01:15:45,296
I'm so glad you could be here
with us tonight.

935
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:47,569
- Go to hell.
- I already did.

936
01:15:47,643 --> 01:15:49,474
And that's why I'm here
with you today.

937
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:52,981
Actually, I have my sister
Sarah here to thank, too.

938
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:56,780
Indeed you do, brother Fred,
indeed you do.

939
01:15:56,852 --> 01:16:00,151
You're probably wondering
why we've brought you here.

940
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:04,625
See, brother Bob
was driving his truck around,

941
01:16:04,694 --> 01:16:08,824
blasting his music,
acting all macho while off roading.

942
01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:11,492
But he was basically drunk
on his own testosterone.

943
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:14,468
Which makes a fellow
do terrible things sometimes,

944
01:16:14,537 --> 01:16:16,198
I always say.

945
01:16:16,272 --> 01:16:19,799
Anyhows, brother Bob doesn't see me

946
01:16:19,875 --> 01:16:22,435
taking a leak over near the creek,

947
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:24,843
he done clean runs me over.

948
01:16:24,914 --> 01:16:26,472
Sarah: <i>Bobby heard</i>
<i>the thump, though.</i>

949
01:16:26,549 --> 01:16:28,608
He turns around
and sees his brother Fred

950
01:16:28,684 --> 01:16:30,345
looking deader
than Robert E. Lee.

951
01:16:33,923 --> 01:16:36,983
But he doesn't notice
the tree up ahead.

952
01:16:37,059 --> 01:16:39,391
- ( Giggling )
- Wham.

953
01:16:39,462 --> 01:16:43,626
Next thing brother Bob knows,
he's flying through the windshield.

954
01:16:43,699 --> 01:16:45,064
Brother Bob survived, though.

955
01:16:45,134 --> 01:16:47,932
And I was able
to sew him back together.

956
01:16:48,003 --> 01:16:52,337
Brother Bob, will you go prepare
the Satan's blood.

957
01:16:56,645 --> 01:16:59,136
I was a different story.

958
01:16:59,215 --> 01:17:03,481
Luckily, sister Sarah's studying
witchcraft.

959
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:07,750
She starts praying to the devil,

960
01:17:07,823 --> 01:17:10,257
and praise Satan

961
01:17:10,326 --> 01:17:13,693
'cause I done rise from the dead.

962
01:17:13,763 --> 01:17:16,323
But there's a catch.

963
01:17:16,399 --> 01:17:19,129
For brother Fred to stay alive,

964
01:17:19,201 --> 01:17:21,863
our lord Lucifer needs a sacrifice.

965
01:17:21,937 --> 01:17:25,634
So every full moon,
brother Bob must go out

966
01:17:25,708 --> 01:17:29,701
and run someone down,
just like he did me.

967
01:17:29,779 --> 01:17:32,339
That explains the guy
he mowed down behind the motel.

968
01:17:32,415 --> 01:17:34,906
You catch on quick, boy.

969
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:37,885
Anyways, once brother Bob
has done his work,

970
01:17:37,953 --> 01:17:40,513
sister Sarah does what she does.

971
01:17:40,589 --> 01:17:44,525
Chanting and drawing her fancy stars.

972
01:17:44,593 --> 01:17:48,359
- Pentagrams.
- Sorry sis, pentagrams.

973
01:17:48,431 --> 01:17:51,798
<i>Anyhows, the life energy</i>

974
01:17:51,867 --> 01:17:54,597
<i>of that poor soul</i>
<i>that brother Bob flattened,</i>

975
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:58,106
goes and restores me.

976
01:17:58,174 --> 01:18:01,541
<i>I was not a pretty picture.</i>

977
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:06,047
The bones in my arms and legs
were shattered... lost an eye, too.

978
01:18:06,115 --> 01:18:09,312
I was nothing but a rag doll, really.

979
01:18:09,385 --> 01:18:13,685
Until Sarah started
experimenting sewing

980
01:18:13,756 --> 01:18:16,418
other people's arms and legs onto me.

981
01:18:16,492 --> 01:18:20,292
Well, we couldn't just kill
peoples and take their limbs, no.

982
01:18:21,831 --> 01:18:23,992
No, we discovered
we had to let them live

983
01:18:24,066 --> 01:18:27,558
if we wanted
my new arm or leg to take.

984
01:18:27,636 --> 01:18:30,833
Yeah, we met some of your friends
you borrowed from.

985
01:18:30,906 --> 01:18:33,932
Yeah, but it's too bad we couldn't
borrow a torso that would work.

986
01:18:34,009 --> 01:18:37,445
<i>Always turned</i>
<i>into a bloody goddamn mess.</i>

987
01:18:37,513 --> 01:18:39,344
That's where you come in.

988
01:18:39,415 --> 01:18:42,111
Sarah found a new book
of spells and such.

989
01:18:42,184 --> 01:18:45,244
She found I could have me
a whole new body

990
01:18:45,321 --> 01:18:47,846
if it were prepared right.

991
01:18:47,923 --> 01:18:50,858
- Prepared right?
- Yeah.

992
01:18:50,926 --> 01:18:53,520
This devil's manual Sarah came by

993
01:18:53,596 --> 01:18:56,429
explains that with the right rituals

994
01:18:56,499 --> 01:18:59,263
and the correct dark ceremonies

995
01:18:59,335 --> 01:19:03,328
prior to slicing and dicing
and hitching and stitching,

996
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:07,171
we wouldn't have the problems we've had
before attaching a torso to me.

997
01:19:07,243 --> 01:19:11,043
My brother
is getting your body, Adam.

998
01:19:11,113 --> 01:19:14,571
<i>( laughing )</i>

999
01:19:20,389 --> 01:19:22,016
What's this, huh?

1000
01:19:22,091 --> 01:19:24,218
What, you gonna leave
before the party starts?

1001
01:19:24,293 --> 01:19:26,022
Fred:
<i>You should be honored.</i>

1002
01:19:26,095 --> 01:19:28,893
Sarah picked you out from the get go.

1003
01:19:28,964 --> 01:19:31,125
It was you in the hearse, wasn't it?

1004
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,225
Sizing me up?

1005
01:19:34,837 --> 01:19:38,466
We needed someone pliable.

1006
01:19:38,541 --> 01:19:42,068
Someone easy to prepare.

1007
01:19:42,144 --> 01:19:44,305
And that you were.

1008
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:48,749
Step one, we needed
a body to voluntarily

1009
01:19:48,817 --> 01:19:52,548
step inside a pentagram
with a decapitated body.

1010
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:54,816
Shit, the trailer home.

1011
01:19:56,725 --> 01:19:58,852
Oh shit is right.

1012
01:19:58,928 --> 01:20:01,920
Phase two, we needed you
to sleep with road kill.

1013
01:20:03,332 --> 01:20:06,790
Item three and four came easy.

1014
01:20:06,869 --> 01:20:08,564
My favorite.

1015
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:12,038
Sarah needed to taste your blood,

1016
01:20:12,107 --> 01:20:13,870
and take your virginity.

1017
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:17,708
Four times just to be sure.

1018
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:21,773
Shut up, Sarah,
you're making me jealous.

1019
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:24,045
What was the last thing?
I had to eat the dead?

1020
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:25,916
Fred:
<i>Almost last thing.</i>

1021
01:20:25,988 --> 01:20:28,183
The final step in preparing you
was simple.

1022
01:20:28,257 --> 01:20:30,122
You had to be scared to death.

1023
01:20:31,327 --> 01:20:34,956
I think brother Bob did a fine job
of doing that.

1024
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:38,459
I want to thank you
for letting me have

1025
01:20:38,534 --> 01:20:41,765
your beautiful body, young man.

1026
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:43,805
I only have one question,

1027
01:20:43,872 --> 01:20:46,932
<i>you diddled my sister with that body,</i>

1028
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:48,636
so when I get your body,

1029
01:20:48,711 --> 01:20:52,203
does that mean
I fucked my own sister?

1030
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:57,078
Stop worrying about that,
brother Fred.

1031
01:20:57,152 --> 01:20:59,245
When you're all brand new,

1032
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:01,812
I'll do something to make
that a moot point.

1033
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,592
Shall we begin?

1034
01:21:13,636 --> 01:21:17,834
Goodbye, Adam.
You'll always be a part of me.

1035
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:22,233
<i>( laughing )</i>

1036
01:21:34,256 --> 01:21:36,451
I take it back,
I never liked the color of your eyes.

1037
01:21:39,628 --> 01:21:42,620
He's getting away, he's getting away.

1038
01:21:45,868 --> 01:21:47,267

1039

01:22:14,296 --> 01:22:15,888
Oww.

1043
01:22:15,964 --> 01:22:17,556
Now your name really is fuck face.

Fuck you!

1052
01:23:42,184 --> 01:23:45,517
Looking for this, boy?

1053
01:23:59,935 --> 01:24:03,200
Oh, you may be quiet
as a church mouse,

1054

but you'll soon make a mistake.

1055

And then I'll get you.

1056
01:24:24,827 --> 01:24:29,264
I'm not dead yet,
but I'm gonna be soon.

1057
01:24:29,331 --> 01:24:32,823
And you're gonna be joining me.

Is the little wussy hurt?

I got a sixth sense for blood,
wussy boy.

1063

It's my own special radar.

1064
01:25:08,670 --> 01:25:13,130
And the more blood there is,
the stronger I'm drawn to it.

There's no hiding from me now,

It's no problem, bro.

1090
01:29:06,608 --> 01:29:09,099
This is probably getting
a little swishy, isn't it?

1091
01:29:09,177 --> 01:29:11,372
Yeah, just a little bit.

1092
01:29:11,446 --> 01:29:15,212
But speaking of swishy,
I got you a little present.

1093
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:20,282
I like that.

1094
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:23,586
So, if you drive like a maniac, we can
still make it to Betty Ann's wedding.

1095
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:28,259
- Screw Betty Ann.
- Excuse me?

1096
01:29:28,330 --> 01:29:30,423
I don't really think
she's my type anymore.

1097
01:29:30,499 --> 01:29:33,093
Well then let's go pick up
some poontang.

1098
01:29:34,636 --> 01:29:36,729
Come on, man,
what are you waiting for?

1099
01:29:36,805 --> 01:29:38,432
Start up this bad boy.

1100
01:29:42,577 --> 01:29:44,545
Harley:
<i>Whoo-ho!</i>

1101
01:29:44,613 --> 01:29:47,309
Whoo-ho!

1102
01:30:05,867 --> 01:30:08,665
( Faint groaning )

1103
01:30:11,773 --> 01:30:13,741
Wussies.

1104
01:30:13,808 --> 01:30:17,369
You can't kill me,

1105
01:30:17,445 --> 01:30:22,007
you can't kill me, wussies.

1106
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:26,213
You can't kill me.

1107
01:30:30,225 --> 01:30:32,455
Fred:
<i>The end?</i>

1108
01:30:32,527 --> 01:30:36,361
This can't be the end.

1109
01:30:36,431 --> 01:30:38,365
I'm still alive,

1110
01:30:39,868 --> 01:30:43,770
and I was gonna fuck my sister.

1111
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:47,503
Now what am I gonna do?

1112
01:30:47,576 --> 01:30:49,840
Oh God!

1113
01:30:51,513 --> 01:30:54,004
( Sobbing )

1114
01:30:55,984 --> 01:30:58,885
This sucks.
