1
00:01:02,466 --> 00:01:04,868
( panting )

2
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:33,368
( grunting )

3
00:01:48,266 --> 00:01:50,368
# Thís love #

4
00:01:56,433 --> 00:01:58,368
# Thís love #

5
00:02:04,633 --> 00:02:06,468
# Thís love #

6
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:09,469
# ís a love líke no other,
no, no #

7
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:12,002
# No, l don't want another... #

8
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:19,068
# ... It would be,
ít would be, ít would be #

9
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:22,169
# It would be thís love #

10
00:02:22,233 --> 00:02:26,003
# Is a love líke no other... #

11
00:02:41,032 --> 00:02:42,967
Die, die.

12
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:51,235
( laughing)
l got you, Adam.

13
00:02:52,266 --> 00:02:54,468
- Harley?!
- Talk about skid marks?

14
00:02:54,533 --> 00:02:57,269
l bet the ones on the roads
aren't the only ones around.

15
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,268
That was not funny!

16
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:02,701
So you're off
to Be_ Ann McAllistor's wedding.

17
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:04,735
l just wanted to come along.

18
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,302
- No way.
- Oh, yes way. l'm coming.

19
00:03:07,366 --> 00:03:09,234
No! No, you're not.
You can--

20
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:10,933
You can hitch a ride back
for all l care.

21
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,368
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

22
00:03:12,433 --> 00:03:15,903
- Is that your final decision?
- Yes.

23
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:24,668
Ow, ow, ow!
Ow, ow, ow!

24
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:27,068
( laughing)
Ow, ow, ow! Ow, ow, ow!

25
00:03:28,733 --> 00:03:31,268
You are such a bastard
with those tittie-_isters, man.

26
00:03:32,867 --> 00:03:35,002
Oh, Adam, come on, man.

27
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:37,501
Let me in, Adam.
It'll be like old times, buddy.

28
00:03:37,566 --> 00:03:39,534
- Forget it, Harley.
- Oh come on,

29
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,203
- this trip will let us patch things up.
- That bus has already leR town.

30
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:45,234
We're never gonna be friends again.

31
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:49,434
( Harley laughs )

32
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,803
You still keep your spare
in your magnetic hide-a-key.

33
00:03:52,867 --> 00:03:55,736
You are so predictable!

34
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,569
Uh-uh, that's mine, baby.

35
00:04:00,967 --> 00:04:03,636
Harley: l never liked Be_ Ann.
You know why?

36
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,635
'Cause she was
a major prick tease, dude.

37
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,668
You were friends with her
for over 10 years,

38
00:04:07,733 --> 00:04:09,835
and not once did she consider you
as a boyFriend.

39
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,735
l know that's what you wanted.

40
00:04:15,533 --> 00:04:17,468
Hey, what are you doing?
Come on!

41
00:04:17,533 --> 00:04:19,501
( Harley laughs )

42
00:04:20,867 --> 00:04:22,335
Just what l suspected, bro'.

43
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,467
You still keep her picture
in your pocket.

44
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:27,769
And it's laminated, even, man.

45
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,068
- You're such a wussy.
- l'm not a wussy, okay?

46
00:04:30,133 --> 00:04:32,835
And you have no idea what
my relationship with Be_ Ann is like.

47
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,736
Oh, l do. And l'm a lot deeper
than you think.

48
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,868
l'm an anthropology major,
you know, bro'?

49
00:04:37,933 --> 00:04:40,902
Yeah, for seven and a half years.
You haven't learned anything.

50
00:04:40,967 --> 00:04:44,570
l have too. If l was an anthropologist
200 years in the future,

51
00:04:44,633 --> 00:04:46,368
and l came across your car,
l would still

52
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:49,068
- deduce that you were a wussy.
- Okay, and how would you do that?

53
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:51,668
First of all, l would conclude
that you're overly cautious.

54
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:54,068
'Cause not only do you have

55
00:04:54,133 --> 00:04:56,435
a Club for your steering wheel,

56
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,970
but you also have Lowjack as evidenced
by the beeper on your key chain.

57
00:05:00,032 --> 00:05:03,301
lt's for security purposes
and it protects my car.

58
00:05:03,366 --> 00:05:06,635
And most guys use a little black book
to write babes' numbers in.

59
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,935
You, however,
use your little black book

60
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,335
to keep track
of your car's gas mileage.

61
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:14,969
l've got a babe's number in there,
if you just look in the Bs.

62
00:05:15,032 --> 00:05:17,634
You write it all down
with this i_ bi_ little pencil

63
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,668
'cause you're too cheap
to buy a new one.

64
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:24,236
And what kind of person
puts one of these on their antenna?

65
00:05:24,299 --> 00:05:27,835
- A little wussy, that's who.
- That's it.

66
00:05:29,032 --> 00:05:30,767
Okay--

67
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,602
That's right, l wanna hear it.
l'm not a wussy.

68
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,934
- No way.
- l'm not gonna let you out,

69
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,968
- until you say it.
- l'm not gonna say it.

70
00:05:38,032 --> 00:05:41,402
- l'm not a little wussy.
- No, you're a wussy.

71
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:45,001
l'm not letting you out
until you say it, Harley.

72
00:05:45,066 --> 00:05:47,635
- Okay, you're not a little wussy.
- Right.

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,235
( coughs )

74
00:05:51,299 --> 00:05:53,501
You're not a wussy, man.

75
00:05:53,566 --> 00:05:55,434
You're not a little wussy.

76
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,768
You are a complete wussy.

77
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,902
Look, Adam,
all l'm tying to say

78
00:06:00,967 --> 00:06:03,569
is that aRer all the term papers
you ghost wrote for Be_ Ann

79
00:06:03,633 --> 00:06:05,468
and all the finals
you prepped her for,

80
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:08,068
she not once unclamped
her knobby little knees for you,

81
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:10,101
let alone let you make out with her.

82
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:13,068
Just admit it, man.
She used you.

83
00:06:14,299 --> 00:06:16,267
She did not use me.

84
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,134
She just--

85
00:06:41,299 --> 00:06:43,601
That was weird.

86
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,068
Yeah.

87
00:06:53,733 --> 00:06:56,135
Yeah, Adam,
Iet's get serious.

88
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:59,769
You know a girl's pubic hair
is really like her hood ornament?

89
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,901
How she shaves
her vagímo says a lot

90
00:07:01,967 --> 00:07:04,069
about what she's
got under the hood.

91
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:06,969
But if her little sex goatee
is pe_ectly manicured

92
00:07:07,032 --> 00:07:10,802
into a little caterpillar
or a cute little butte_ly,

93
00:07:10,867 --> 00:07:12,969
like, l bet this girl's done--

94
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:16,502
Whoo, boy, tellíng you she's got
a lot of horsepower under that hood,

95
00:07:16,566 --> 00:07:19,335
and she's gonna be one sweet ride.

96
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,102
Man, you're too much.

97
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:26,035
l can't believe l let you come along
on this trip with me.

98
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,201
Good God.

99
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,502
Hey, this is
a choice opportunity, all right?

100
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:35,567
We stopped being pals
over Be_ Ann.

101
00:07:35,633 --> 00:07:37,634
l thought that now
that she was getting hitched

102
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,835
you'd be over her
and maybe we could start over.

103
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,602
You know, this road trip, l thought,
would be the trick.

104
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:45,435
- Tell a few jokes, have a few laughs.
- l don't know, man.

105
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,202
lt's a little hard getting over
being punched in the face

106
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:50,434
- by your best friend.
- You called me a liar.

107
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,269
- You called Be_ Ann a slut.
- She is.

108
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,668
The skank can deep throat
a garden hose.

109
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:58,001
The bitch was humping
eveybody, but you.

110
00:07:58,066 --> 00:08:00,134
Look, l just didn't want you
to get hurt, man.

111
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:03,235
Right, right. Well, then
you shouldn't have punched me.

112
00:08:04,733 --> 00:08:07,769
Harley:
l am ín awe, l am ín utter awe.

113
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,968
Thís ís rídículous.

114
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:13,935
The forces of stupidity are far greater
than the forces of intelligence.

115
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,770
We're outnumbered, _dam.
We are severely outnumbered.

116
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,969
Now look at this, look at these
pea brain watching this crap.

117
00:08:21,032 --> 00:08:23,401
Could you just kind
of keep it down a little bit?

118
00:08:23,466 --> 00:08:25,467
Harley:
These rednecks must have an l.Q.

119
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:28,569
the same number
as my unde_ear size to enjoy this.

120
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,667
l don't really think
it's such a good idea

121
00:08:31,733 --> 00:08:33,901
to use the phrase redneck
in a place like this.

122
00:08:33,967 --> 00:08:36,769
Okay, okay.

123
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:39,268
How are these hillbillies
ever gonna change

124
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,535
unless someone poínts out
how lame ass they are.

125
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,703
You owe me $12.63 for the meal.

126
00:08:44,767 --> 00:08:47,736
They have got to know that watching
a monster truck exhibition

127
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,469
is just as bad as buying
a velvet painting of Elvis.

128
00:08:51,867 --> 00:08:53,768
ls there any way l can get you
to just shut up?

129
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,434
lf a vehicle could take Viagra,

130
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,435
a mo_ster truck
ís what ít would look líke.

131
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,136
Those giant tires make the truck look
like it's got blue balls.

132
00:09:01,199 --> 00:09:03,234
- And another thíng--
- ( Velcro ríppíng )

133
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:05,300
( Velcro ripping )

134
00:09:09,032 --> 00:09:11,000
What?

135
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,501
l'm speechless.

136
00:09:22,566 --> 00:09:25,502
Did you know that you suffer
from diarrhea of the mouth?

137
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,002
Oh, back there at the diner.

138
00:09:29,066 --> 00:09:31,802
Yeah, l was just having
a few shits and grins.

139
00:09:31,867 --> 00:09:34,236
Yeah, well you totally pissed
those people off, man.

140
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:36,434
They looked like they were
gonna pummel us.

141
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,169
You know, you haven't changed one bit
since you roomed in college.

142
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,603
You secretly like having me around
'cause you know l'm good for you.

143
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,467
How is that?

144
00:09:46,533 --> 00:09:48,568
You live vicariously through me.

145
00:09:48,633 --> 00:09:51,035
lf it weren't for me,
''Dr. Maestro Sir,''

146
00:09:51,099 --> 00:09:53,935
you wouldn't know the first thing
about free style orifice probing.

147
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,803
Your entire sexual knowledge is based
on listening to my experiences,

148
00:09:57,867 --> 00:10:00,869
which l kindly give you the blow
by blow, if you know what l mean.

149
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,267
Hey, stop that.

150
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:14,502
And l call you on all
the swishy stuffyou do.

151
00:10:14,566 --> 00:10:16,734
- Swishy?
- Yeah, swishy. Like that.

152
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,602
- Like what?
- You just used your turn signal

153
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:23,002
to pass a piece of road kill and there's
not a goddamned car in sight.

154
00:10:23,066 --> 00:10:25,134
Shut up.

155
00:10:30,433 --> 00:10:33,402
You're 25 and you never done it.

156
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:37,136
You never even tried.
You're still a fucking virgin.

157
00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:40,468
Fucking virgin?
Isn't that an oxymoron?

158
00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:43,602
No, man, it's just plain moron.

159
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,634
Just admit it, man.
You never done it.

160
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,370
Never done the dim deed.
Never conjugated the verb.

161
00:10:49,433 --> 00:10:51,434
You never made the beast
with _o backs.

162
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,468
lt's not what you think.

163
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:56,035
lt's not what you think?
You remind me of the guy

164
00:10:56,099 --> 00:10:59,168
with the skull-and-bones full-body
tattoo caught in the crack house

165
00:10:59,233 --> 00:11:01,935
with his buck naked, shaved pussy,
skinhead teenage girlfriend.

166
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,569
He's got blow up his nose,
needle sticking out of his arms,

167
00:11:04,633 --> 00:11:08,269
a cache of uzies next to his KKK
propaganda and child pornography.

168
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,268
The doors are smashed down
and he's caught.

169
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:13,269
He says to the SWAT team,
''Hey, it's not what you think.''

170
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:17,335
Shut up.

171
00:11:18,366 --> 00:11:18,399
You know the reason l've never done it.
l haven't found the right girl.

172
00:11:21,967 --> 00:11:25,303
No, it's because you've been stupidly
saving yourself for Be_ Ann.

173
00:11:25,366 --> 00:11:27,334
But you're not fooling me, man.

174
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:30,301
l figured out what lame ass move
you're gonna pull once you see her.

175
00:11:31,433 --> 00:11:34,235
- What are you talking about?
- l know you.

176
00:11:34,299 --> 00:11:37,435
You've never told Be_ Ann how you
really feel but you've always wanted to.

177
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,969
Now tíme ís runníng out,
ít's your last chance.

178
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,933
You're gonna have
to declare your love for her

179
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,569
and hope that she drops this dildo
she's about to mary for you.

180
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,401
( laughíng)
l'm ríght, aren't l?

181
00:11:47,466 --> 00:11:49,434
That's what you're gonna do.

182
00:11:50,566 --> 00:11:52,968
( approachíng engíne roaríng )

183
00:11:56,233 --> 00:11:58,301
Look at the size of that thing.

184
00:12:01,032 --> 00:12:03,167
Hey, buddy,
you know what this is?

185
00:12:03,233 --> 00:12:05,068
lt's a flock of these!

186
00:12:07,066 --> 00:12:09,468
- Are you nuts?
- The ''rum ranger'' deserved it, man.

187
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:34,435
- Can't this thing go any faster?
- l got it floored, l got it floored.

188
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,234
This can't be happening.

189
00:12:51,867 --> 00:12:55,670
Oh, man, for once maybe you were right,
l shouldn't have flipped him off.

190
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,569
Just let him pass us, man.
Just let him pass us.

191
00:12:58,633 --> 00:13:00,267
Come on, man, pass us.

192
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:03,669
Okay, okay, pass me.
Come on, pass me.

193
00:13:03,733 --> 00:13:06,268
l'm sory, l didn't mean
to flip you off, man.

194
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,501
Oh, oh, God.

195
00:13:15,767 --> 00:13:17,668
- Jesus Christ.
- He's gonna hit us again.

196
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:46,500
( Harley laughs )

197
00:13:48,967 --> 00:13:52,470
l feel like we just played drop
the soap with Godzilla, man.

198
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:54,734
Damn you. It's all your fault.

199
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,167
Get off me, Adam.

200
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,467
Adam, get off me.

201
00:14:05,233 --> 00:14:08,135
Oh, yeah!
It's time for super wedgie time.

202
00:14:09,633 --> 00:14:12,402
Super wedgies!
Wahoo!

203
00:14:12,466 --> 00:14:14,968
You fight like a girl.
You fight like a girl.

204
00:14:15,032 --> 00:14:17,401
How do you like that now, huh?
How do you like that?

205
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,667
Adam, you're pissing me off
right now.

206
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,502
( screaming, laughing )

207
00:14:24,566 --> 00:14:28,970
- ( both scream)
- Captain Harley's cruncher.

208
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,234
Eat the dirt!

209
00:14:35,466 --> 00:14:38,936
Stop it, Adam, stop it.
Stop it or l'm gonna fart on you.

210
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,434
Okay.

211
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,602
That was a wise choice,
Kimosabe.

212
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,801
You know l would've.

213
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:52,103
Give it another ty, Adam.
We should be able to get this started.

214
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,668
These Vísta Cruísers
usually keep goíng forever.

215
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:03,002
Hey, the fuel line's busted
but l can fix that.

216
00:15:04,133 --> 00:15:06,969
Where are we gonna get more gas,
Dr. Maestro Sir?

217
00:15:21,266 --> 00:15:23,301
Hey Adam, wait up.

218
00:15:24,366 --> 00:15:26,868
Hey man, was l right?

219
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:29,335
Are you gonna tell Be_ Ann
how you really feel?

220
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,101
Yeah.

221
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:39,836
Yeah, l'm gonna tell her l love her.

222
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:43,303
l don't expect her to leave her guy
for me or anything,

223
00:15:44,566 --> 00:15:47,302
but l couldn't live with myself
if l didn't at least ty,

224
00:15:47,366 --> 00:15:49,000
right?

225
00:15:50,299 --> 00:15:51,933
That's nice.

226
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,202
Just one thing.

227
00:15:54,266 --> 00:15:56,434
Before you tell Be_ Ann that,

228
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,969
you better take those tampons
out of your nose.

229
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:07,803
Come on, man,
stop being such a douche.

230
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:10,302
You're being
such a fucking douche.

231
00:16:14,566 --> 00:16:16,234
What's that?

232
00:16:16,299 --> 00:16:19,268
lt marks where someone died,
Mr. Anthropology.

233
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:22,035
How do you know that?

234
00:16:22,099 --> 00:16:24,067
Some guys in my contract law class

235
00:16:24,133 --> 00:16:26,568
were in this nasty
drunk driving accident.

236
00:16:26,633 --> 00:16:29,635
As a memorial some of my classmates
put up a cross in the road

237
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,369
- and marked where they died.
- Huh.

238
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,170
You know those silicone implants they
give to girls when they get boob jobs?

239
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:41,301
You k_ow, they're
supposed to last forever.

240
00:16:41,366 --> 00:16:43,568
What freaks me out is
when one of these women dies.

241
00:16:43,633 --> 00:16:46,736
ARer a few years her corpse
will totally be rotting in the ground,

242
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,003
but her carcass will have
these pe_ect silicone implants

243
00:16:50,066 --> 00:16:52,234
still sitting on her decayed chest.

244
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:55,368
- It's disgusting.
- Hey, come on, man.

245
00:16:55,433 --> 00:16:57,468
l'm just tying to make you laugh.

246
00:16:57,533 --> 00:17:01,403
Can you not be serious for one minute?
That truck ran us off the road.

247
00:17:01,466 --> 00:17:03,634
You really think
he was tying to kill us?

248
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,334
lt sure seemed like it, yeah.

249
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,434
lt's probably just a redneck
from back in the diner

250
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,001
tying to get us back
for what l said.

251
00:17:09,066 --> 00:17:10,967
No, it seems like more
than just payback.

252
00:17:11,032 --> 00:17:12,800
- You're paranoid.
- ( crows squawkíng )

253
00:17:12,867 --> 00:17:17,204
Just because you're paranoid,
doesn't mean that--

254
00:17:17,266 --> 00:17:20,202
doesn't mean
that someone isn't coming aRer you.

255
00:17:20,266 --> 00:17:23,469
Hey, look at that.

256
00:17:23,533 --> 00:17:25,501
They have gas.

257
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:29,001
Come on.

258
00:17:29,066 --> 00:17:31,201
Uh, watch that.

259
00:17:33,466 --> 00:17:35,868
Hello? Hello!

260
00:17:35,933 --> 00:17:37,901
Anybody home?

261
00:17:37,967 --> 00:17:41,070
Hello! Anybody home?

262
00:17:42,633 --> 00:17:44,468
There's no one home.

263
00:17:44,533 --> 00:17:46,301
Probably went for a hike
or something...

264
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:48,401
l guess we could wait here
until they come back.

265
00:17:48,466 --> 00:17:50,734
Forget that.
Iet's just siphon in some fuel.

266
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,669
- Can we do that?
- l've done it plenty of times before.

267
00:17:53,733 --> 00:17:57,436
l can use this cup. l'll just
suck it out and spit it right in here.

268
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,467
( laughing )

269
00:18:21,933 --> 00:18:26,103
Hey man, that's not the gas tank,
it's the septic tank.

270
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:29,836
- ( coughing, gagging)
- ( laughíng )

271
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,370
l'm sory, man, l should have told you.
l couldn't resist.

272
00:18:35,466 --> 00:18:37,768
You knew?

273
00:18:43,133 --> 00:18:47,470
Hey, man, at least
you finally made me laugh, right?

274
00:18:49,366 --> 00:18:52,068
( grunts )

275
00:19:04,366 --> 00:19:06,167
Harley:
That was a good one.

276
00:19:06,233 --> 00:19:09,069
You got me Adam,
that was a pre_ good joke.

277
00:19:09,133 --> 00:19:10,767
Speaking of which,
did you know

278
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,569
that ''Citizen Kane'' is
the biggest practical joke in the world?

279
00:19:13,633 --> 00:19:15,234
How is that?

280
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:18,168
Well, Charles Foster Kane was based
on William Randolph Hearst,

281
00:19:18,233 --> 00:19:19,867
the big newspaper magnate.

282
00:19:19,933 --> 00:19:23,803
And William Randolph Hearst named
his girlfriend's pussy, her rosebud.

283
00:19:23,867 --> 00:19:26,202
That's why
the biggest line in the movie

284
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:28,701
is the biggest practical joke
in the world.

285
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:32,704
- Rosebud.
- ( both laugh )

286
00:19:32,767 --> 00:19:36,504
Say it with me once.
Rosebud.

287
00:19:36,566 --> 00:19:40,836
- Rosebud.
- Rosebud, rosebud.

288
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,970
( both)
Rosebud, rosebud, rosebud.

289
00:19:45,032 --> 00:19:47,734
Rosebud, rosebud, rosebud.

290
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,568
Rosebud.

291
00:19:49,633 --> 00:19:53,903
- Rosebud.
- Rosebud.

292
00:19:53,967 --> 00:19:56,836
Rosebud.

293
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,102
Wow, check out this space cowgirl.

294
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,535
Oh, oh, Adam, slow down,
now ís your chance.

295
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,170
- Oh, thís gírl ís made for bangíng.
- l can't pull over.

296
00:20:05,233 --> 00:20:07,401
You could totally buy
your dead hamster in her grave.

297
00:20:07,466 --> 00:20:09,668
She ís absolutely made for bangíng.

298
00:20:09,733 --> 00:20:12,502
Oh, just observe
that comme_dable firm_ess.

299
00:20:12,566 --> 00:20:15,835
That bellybutton ríng ís a sure sígn
that she ís corrupt wíth horníness.

300
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,769
l'll bet you she ís mee and bree_y
underneath that skírt,

301
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:21,936
giving you easy access
to her rosebud.

302
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,335
Yeah right, l can't pick up some chick

303
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:26,234
just before l declare my love
to Be_ Ann.

304
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:27,933
Oh, oh, fuck.

305
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,436
R-O-

306
00:20:41,066 --> 00:20:43,501
S-E-

307
00:20:43,566 --> 00:20:47,736
B-U-D.

308
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,068
( echoíng )

309
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:08,567
Excuse me,
are there restrooms back there?

310
00:21:08,633 --> 00:21:10,267
Okay, thanks.

311
00:21:18,633 --> 00:21:20,334
( screams )

312
00:21:21,867 --> 00:21:24,302
Nasty.

313
00:21:44,233 --> 00:21:47,436
( snoring )

314
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:17,670
Rosebud, rosebud.

315
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,635
( engíne roars )

316
00:24:32,066 --> 00:24:34,067
( growlíng )

317
00:24:40,233 --> 00:24:42,001
( bangíng )

318
00:25:14,366 --> 00:25:17,102
( growlíng and bangíng )

319
00:25:23,767 --> 00:25:26,469
( bangíng stops )

320
00:25:26,533 --> 00:25:30,270
- ( footsteps echoing)
- ( door squeaking )

321
00:25:53,466 --> 00:25:57,102
( panting )

322
00:26:39,867 --> 00:26:41,902
What the hell are you doing?

323
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:44,936
A little payback of our own, buddy.

324
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,435
Harley, you gotta get down,
he's coming. Let's go.

325
00:26:48,967 --> 00:26:52,904
Move your fat ass.
Come on, hury, hury, jump.

326
00:26:52,967 --> 00:26:55,202
Let's go!

327
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,735
That's a first-- you're going
over the speed limit.

328
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,401
Shut up,
you're so stupid.

329
00:27:11,466 --> 00:27:14,202
He didn't even know we were there.
We were parked on the south side.

330
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:16,234
l don't care,
l saw the guy-- he is a freak.

331
00:27:16,299 --> 00:27:17,933
We were hidden
behind the dumpster.

332
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,702
He had this one eye-- it was all white,
it didn't even look human.

333
00:27:20,767 --> 00:27:23,936
There is no way that he saw us,
There is absolutely no way that he saw--

334
00:27:26,199 --> 00:27:29,669
Umm, Adam?

335
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:32,402
Was that like that before we stopped
at the gas station?

336
00:27:34,767 --> 00:27:36,935
Oh no, man, now he knows it was us,

337
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,335
he knows it was you
who pissed in his truck.

338
00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:41,334
l been waiting my whole life
to fuck up like this.

339
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:43,601
Congratulations,
you fulfilled your destiny.

340
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:46,368
- Adam, l gotta tell you something.
- Yeah, what?

341
00:27:46,433 --> 00:27:48,101
l mean l really don't want
to tell you,

342
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,234
but l'd hate to go to my grave
without letting you know.

343
00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:51,833
Okay.

344
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,736
l slept with Be_ Ann.

345
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:01,067
Aren't you gonna say anything?

346
00:28:03,233 --> 00:28:05,201
That's how l knew
she was sleeping around,

347
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:06,900
and that's why
l was badmouthing her.

348
00:28:06,967 --> 00:28:09,269
l wanted you to get over her
so if you found out what l did

349
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:11,068
you might not be quite as mad.

350
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:15,100
l'm sory.

351
00:28:16,166 --> 00:28:18,001
( approachíng engíne roaríng )

352
00:28:41,433 --> 00:28:43,768
Okay, l parked
the car around back

353
00:28:43,833 --> 00:28:45,801
so no one should know
we're staying here.

354
00:28:45,867 --> 00:28:48,636
You know,
l actually think we're in the clear.

355
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:52,203
l mean, the odds of him finding us
are like winning the lottey.

356
00:28:52,266 --> 00:28:56,269
We're more likely to find a dead hooker
stuffed in our mattress.

357
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:58,501
Hey Harley, look at that.

358
00:28:58,566 --> 00:29:01,769
... police discovered the body of a man
murdered inside his motor home.

359
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:03,568
No details were released.

360
00:29:03,633 --> 00:29:07,403
Police would only comment that it was a
grisly scene inside the camper trailer,

361
00:29:07,466 --> 00:29:09,634
a_d that part ofthe body
had bee_ removed.

362
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:14,805
KTML has unsubstantiated reports that
the body was decapitated.

363
00:29:14,867 --> 00:29:18,370
Satanic ritual is suspected as indicated
by the large pentagram

364
00:29:18,433 --> 00:29:20,067
drawn in the field,

365
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,435
apparently with the vehicle's wheels...

366
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,401
That's the motor home
where we stole the gas.

367
00:29:24,466 --> 00:29:26,100
l know, l know.

368
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:29,202
Oh man, this whole trip
is turning into a nightmare.

369
00:29:29,266 --> 00:29:32,469
We're getting chased around
by a madman in a monster truck.

370
00:29:32,533 --> 00:29:35,769
We're running around trailer homes
with corpses inside of them.

371
00:29:35,833 --> 00:29:37,601
l found out you slept
with Be_ Ann.

372
00:29:39,833 --> 00:29:41,901
l don't know what's worse.

373
00:29:41,967 --> 00:29:44,269
We gotta call the police.

374
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:47,002
And tell them what,
l sucked in a mouthful of shit?

375
00:29:47,066 --> 00:29:50,002
- We didn't see any of that.
- Harley, we have an obligation.

376
00:29:50,066 --> 00:29:52,535
What if they hold us for questioning.

377
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,402
There's no way you're gonna get
to Be_ Ann before she gets married.

378
00:29:55,466 --> 00:29:57,701
We don't know anything
that's gonna help them.

379
00:29:57,767 --> 00:30:00,569
Do you really wanna drive back
into the monster truck's backyard?

380
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:03,102
l think it's just best that we get
the hell out of Dodge.

381
00:30:03,166 --> 00:30:07,803
Oh, oh, do you have
any _eezers, man?

382
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:18,003
Oh, shit man, you got evemhing in that
batman utility belt of yours.

383
00:30:19,266 --> 00:30:21,468
Ow, oh god,

384
00:30:21,533 --> 00:30:24,369
ah, l can't get it out.

385
00:30:39,833 --> 00:30:42,468
Man:
l'm gonna get you.

386
00:30:45,199 --> 00:30:47,768
l'm gonna get you.

387
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,469
l'm gonna get you.

388
00:30:52,533 --> 00:30:56,637
l'm gonna get you.
l'm gonna get you.

389
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,401
l'm gonna get you.
l'm gonna get you.

390
00:31:01,099 --> 00:31:03,067
l'm gonna get you.

391
00:31:03,133 --> 00:31:05,735
( faínt whísperíng )

392
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,768
l'm gonna get you.

393
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:12,571
l'm gonna get you.

394
00:31:14,733 --> 00:31:17,035
l'm gonna get you.

395
00:31:18,967 --> 00:31:22,170
l'm gonna get you
and bang your brains out, baby.

396
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:27,402
l'm gonna get you
and bang your braíns out baby, yeah.

397
00:32:16,833 --> 00:32:18,768
( screaming )

398
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:23,734
How do you like that?

399
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,203
Oh, you like that, don't you?
Mm-hmm.

400
00:32:28,933 --> 00:32:33,170
You take it, yeah, baby, yeah.

401
00:32:33,233 --> 00:32:36,402
Oh, oh boy, yeah,

402
00:32:36,466 --> 00:32:39,235
your snatch is so wet for me, honey.

403
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:43,169
Mm, you like that, don't you?
What's that, honey?

404
00:32:43,233 --> 00:32:46,269
You want me to lick your button, huh?

405
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:50,234
Yeah, daddy will
take it home for you, baby.

406
00:32:50,299 --> 00:32:53,368
Mm-hmm.

407
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:09,401
( groaning, screaming )

408
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:15,467
( moaning )

409
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:24,068
( both screaming )

410
00:33:30,566 --> 00:33:30,599
Adam: Well, let's )ust look
on the bríght síde.

411
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:35,502
- There's a bríght síde?
- Well yeah, he could've killed us.

412
00:33:35,566 --> 00:33:37,968
Harley: Oh yeah, great,
that makes me feel a lot better.

413
00:33:38,032 --> 00:33:40,968
Adam:
Oh shít, we got a flat.

414
00:33:42,833 --> 00:33:44,568
Look, he got us back.

415
00:33:44,633 --> 00:33:46,601
lt was pure payback,
that's all it had to be.

416
00:33:46,666 --> 00:33:48,968
lf he wanted us dead,
he would've Dahmered with us.

417
00:33:49,032 --> 00:33:51,768
You are one bong hit away
from having absolutely no brain cells.

418
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:53,568
That guy is gonna kill us.

419
00:33:53,633 --> 00:33:56,068
He killed the guy in the woods,
and now he's gonna kill us.

420
00:33:56,133 --> 00:33:59,302
He's just waiting for the right moment.
l know it. l just know it.

421
00:33:59,366 --> 00:34:01,568
Come on, come on,
help me fix this.

422
00:34:01,633 --> 00:34:03,568
No way.
l'm not getting out of this car.

423
00:34:03,633 --> 00:34:05,901
l thought you just said
we had nothing to wory about.

424
00:34:05,967 --> 00:34:09,603
Now come on. l'm not going out there
unless you're there with me,

425
00:34:09,666 --> 00:34:11,300
watching my back.

426
00:34:11,366 --> 00:34:14,235
Forget it. My ass is in this seat.
It's not going an_here.

427
00:34:17,867 --> 00:34:20,269
lf he kills you, can l tell Be_ Ann
that l love her?

428
00:34:21,466 --> 00:34:24,569
- That's not funny.
- And what if l'm telling you the truth?

429
00:34:26,433 --> 00:34:28,434
What, you love Be_ Ann too?

430
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,469
Well yeah, you know
our fling wasn't a one-timer.

431
00:34:31,533 --> 00:34:33,968
l was pretty tore up
when she broke thíngs oRwíth me.

432
00:34:34,032 --> 00:34:36,134
That's why l said
all those bad things about her.

433
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:39,969
This trip has really got me thinking.
l might wanna tell her how l feel.

434
00:34:40,032 --> 00:34:42,667
You wanna tell her how you feel?

435
00:34:42,733 --> 00:34:44,801
Well aRer you, of course.

436
00:34:44,867 --> 00:34:46,868
l figure while she's figuring out
her choices,

437
00:34:46,933 --> 00:34:48,901
l might as well throw my name
into the mix.

438
00:34:49,933 --> 00:34:52,068
You're unbelievable.

439
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:04,733
( both scream )

440
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:20,101
Wow, relax guys,
l was just crashing in your car.

441
00:35:23,666 --> 00:35:25,634
Hi, l'm Sarah.

442
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,002
Hey, l'm Harley,

443
00:35:28,066 --> 00:35:30,168
and this is my dorky friend Adam.

444
00:35:31,233 --> 00:35:33,201
Hi.

445
00:35:34,533 --> 00:35:36,668
Nice outFits.

446
00:35:36,733 --> 00:35:38,768
Oh yeah.

447
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,935
Oh yeah.

448
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,302
So what were you guys doing

449
00:35:46,366 --> 00:35:48,267
in the middle of the night
in your unde_ear, huh?

450
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:51,402
ls this some
sort of frat initiation stunt?

451
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,336
Yeah, l guess you could say
it was something like that.

452
00:35:55,399 --> 00:35:58,735
So, where are you headed?

453
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,936
- An_here but here.
- And why is that?

454
00:36:04,099 --> 00:36:06,067
None of your business.

455
00:36:06,133 --> 00:36:08,635
Oh, mysterious.

456
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,902
l like that.

457
00:36:11,967 --> 00:36:13,968
Sarah: Your kíend
does_'t say much, does he?

458
00:36:14,032 --> 00:36:17,301
No, he gets nervous around girls.

459
00:36:18,466 --> 00:36:21,335
Well maybe
l like the strong silent type.

460
00:36:21,399 --> 00:36:23,968
Well you got the silent part right.

461
00:36:24,032 --> 00:36:26,968
You see, he's a virgin.

462
00:36:27,032 --> 00:36:29,134
Huh.

463
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:32,569
And you're what l call an a-hole.

464
00:36:33,767 --> 00:36:37,437
- Hey, do you need some help?
- Oh, l got it, thanks.

465
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,868
What?

466
00:36:40,933 --> 00:36:42,901
Your eyes--

467
00:36:44,967 --> 00:36:47,169
l like your root beer colored eyes.

468
00:36:47,233 --> 00:36:51,303
Oh, root beer colored eyes.

469
00:36:52,867 --> 00:36:55,569
l like that.

470
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,968
Man: What's your name, bo_

471
00:37:06,032 --> 00:37:08,801
Adam: l told you, o Mcer,
l don't wanna be ídentífied.

472
00:37:08,867 --> 00:37:11,135
- This is an anonymous tip.
- l need your name.

473
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:14,001
- Please just listen.
- All ríght. What's thís about, boy?

474
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:16,501
Just north of the motor home
where you found the murder,

475
00:37:16,566 --> 00:37:18,768
my friend and l were chased off the road

476
00:37:18,833 --> 00:37:22,369
by this huge weird monster truck.

477
00:37:22,433 --> 00:37:24,601
And it, l mean,

478
00:37:24,666 --> 00:37:29,103
who-- whoever was driving the vehicle
was tying to kill us.

479
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:32,602
l think the driver of that monster truck
could be your murderer.

480
00:37:36,366 --> 00:37:39,102
lt's-- it's all yours.

481
00:37:45,767 --> 00:37:47,768
Harley, l just called the cops.

482
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:51,102
Look, maybe they'll actually pick up
that guy in the monster truck.

483
00:37:51,166 --> 00:37:53,635
l think we just gotta get to the wedding
as soon as possible.

484
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,802
l have to talk to Be_ Ann
before she's married.

485
00:37:55,867 --> 00:37:57,735
Are you sure
that's what you wanna do?

486
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,768
You know,
this is your big chance.

487
00:37:59,833 --> 00:38:03,002
- What?
- You know, with Sarah.

488
00:38:03,066 --> 00:38:04,801
This is your moment to lose it.

489
00:38:04,867 --> 00:38:07,236
Pop your chery, become a man,
you name it.

490
00:38:07,299 --> 00:38:11,136
l'm not interested.
l'm really not interested.

491
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:13,534
Oh, l think you're interested big time.

492
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,035
Come on, man, Stop it, stop it.

493
00:38:16,099 --> 00:38:19,569
That chick is hot.
And biology is destiny, baby.

494
00:38:19,633 --> 00:38:22,602
Biology is destiny.

495
00:38:22,666 --> 00:38:25,769
l find it hard to believe she likes me
with you cutting me down at evey turn.

496
00:38:25,833 --> 00:38:27,401
lt's all a part of my plan.

497
00:38:27,466 --> 00:38:29,701
l'm being an a-hole on purpose
so she's gonna hate me

498
00:38:29,767 --> 00:38:31,702
and thereby like you.
It's brilliant.

499
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,235
Oh, okay.

500
00:38:33,299 --> 00:38:35,801
Then how do you explain
being an a-hole before she showed up?

501
00:38:35,867 --> 00:38:38,135
l'm telling you, evemhing
that happened on this trip

502
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:39,934
has happened for a reason.

503
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,902
All the cosmic forces are conspiring
for you to meet this chick.

504
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:44,568
l don't think so.

505
00:38:44,633 --> 00:38:47,869
Come on.
This girl digs you.

506
00:38:47,933 --> 00:38:49,901
And l'll bet you this chick
does anything.

507
00:38:49,967 --> 00:38:53,470
l'll bet you she'll even give you those
little eyelash butte_ly kisses

508
00:38:53,533 --> 00:38:56,936
you like so much--
on your balls, even.

509
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,702
Man, you know, you just want me
to get interested in this girl

510
00:39:00,767 --> 00:39:03,402
because now you've decided
you're in love with Be_ Ann, too.

511
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:06,435
Oh, that is not it at all.
Look man, if you're not gonna go for it,

512
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,435
l'm gonna have to.

513
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,035
She probably likes me better,
an_ay.

514
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:14,035
- Cut it out.
- Oh man, she'll never even know

515
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:15,800
- l felt her up.
- Harley, don't.

516
00:39:15,867 --> 00:39:17,969
- Come on.
- No.

517
00:39:18,032 --> 00:39:21,101
Come on, don't you wanna know
if she's got root beer colored nipples?

518
00:39:21,166 --> 00:39:24,102
Okay, well yes, a little bit, but no,
no, no, don't.

519
00:39:24,166 --> 00:39:25,901
Harley, Harley.

520
00:39:27,433 --> 00:39:29,401
( Harley chuckles )

521
00:39:29,466 --> 00:39:32,969
( moaning)
Oh Adam,

522
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:39,003
l love the way you touch me, baby.

523
00:39:40,066 --> 00:39:42,868
l can't believe that.

524
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:55,769
l can't believe that she's more
attracted to you than she is to me.

525
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:59,203
l mean, that's absurd. l mean,
Iook at you and look at me.

526
00:39:59,266 --> 00:40:00,900
Would you just let this go?

527
00:40:00,967 --> 00:40:03,636
l promise you by the end of this trip
she's gonna be mine.

528
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,968
Why are you getting so competitive
all of a sudden?

529
00:40:06,032 --> 00:40:08,167
- Because l like her.
- Yeah, well l like her too.

530
00:40:08,233 --> 00:40:10,268
Yeah, but you're not
gonna do anything about it,

531
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:13,536
- so why don't you just step aside?
- Can't you let me have this one thing?

532
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,201
She had a dream about me,
so what?

533
00:40:15,266 --> 00:40:17,301
So what? It should've been me.

534
00:40:17,366 --> 00:40:20,001
Yeah, well it should've been me
who slept with Be_ Ann, not you.

535
00:40:20,066 --> 00:40:22,401
Be_ Ann didn't sleep with you
because you're a wussy.

536
00:40:22,466 --> 00:40:24,301
- l'm not a wussy.
- You are too.

537
00:40:24,366 --> 00:40:26,501
- Am not.
- Are too.

538
00:40:26,566 --> 00:40:28,401
- Am not, am not.
- Are too, are too.

539
00:40:28,466 --> 00:40:30,267
- Am not, am not.
- Are too, are too.

540
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:32,201
- Am not, am not.
- Are too, are too.

541
00:40:32,266 --> 00:40:34,267
What the hell's going on?

542
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,033
That's what this is about?

543
00:40:39,066 --> 00:40:41,301
Which one of you l'm attracted to?

544
00:40:41,366 --> 00:40:43,634
You _o are such little boys.

545
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:46,202
l mean, Jesus Christ, you could've
gotten us all killed.

546
00:40:48,266 --> 00:40:50,668
You know what?
l think l'm gonna hitch another ride.

547
00:40:50,733 --> 00:40:54,403
Oh that's great, look what you did.
The best thing about this trip was Sarah

548
00:40:54,466 --> 00:40:56,234
- and now you made her leave.
- Me?

549
00:40:56,299 --> 00:40:57,867
- Yeah, you.
- This is your fault.

550
00:40:57,933 --> 00:41:01,936
Sarah,
Sarah come back.

551
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,736
- Come on, Sarah
- Harley: Come on, Sarah, we're sory.

552
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,735
- All ríght, please?
- Sory.

553
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,637
- l'm sory, please, come back.
- Please, Sarah.

554
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,736
l'm sory.

555
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:24,603
( heavy metal musíc playíng )

556
00:41:35,733 --> 00:41:38,635
Wow! Sweet jelly,
she likes me better!

557
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:42,236
Aah... hold, please.

558
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:45,268
Okay, now is your turn, Adam.

559
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:47,334
What?

560
00:41:47,399 --> 00:41:49,200
Your turn to kiss me.

561
00:41:49,266 --> 00:41:51,701
Then l can tell
who turns me on more.

562
00:41:51,767 --> 00:41:54,903
We can settle this for good
and be on our mery way.

563
00:41:54,967 --> 00:41:57,102
Oh, l--
l don't know--

564
00:41:57,166 --> 00:41:59,368
l don't think so.

565
00:42:08,333 --> 00:42:11,269
( soft musíc playíng )

566
00:42:32,533 --> 00:42:36,003
That's settles it.
Adam wins.

567
00:42:36,066 --> 00:42:38,768
Oh, that's it! All right?
l call the backseat.

568
00:42:38,833 --> 00:42:42,069
This is one bad dream and l just need
to sleep it off, all right?

569
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:56,235
( snoring )

570
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:02,769
So, Sarah,
where are you headed?

571
00:43:02,833 --> 00:43:05,435
Nowhere.

572
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,602
No, seriously,
where are you going?

573
00:43:09,833 --> 00:43:13,002
Look, l don't want to talk about it.

574
00:43:13,066 --> 00:43:17,003
Let's just say
l'm leaving my problems behind.

575
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:26,302
l will tell you one secret though.

576
00:43:28,266 --> 00:43:31,535
l wasn't sleeping
when you touched me.

577
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,568
What?

578
00:43:34,633 --> 00:43:36,968
But then, why did you let me--

579
00:43:37,032 --> 00:43:39,701
oh jeez, l'm really sory.

580
00:43:39,767 --> 00:43:41,602
l mean, Harley and l
were goofing off--

581
00:43:41,666 --> 00:43:43,267
lt's all right.

582
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:46,536
l pretended to dream about you, because
l wanted to teach Harley a lesson.

583
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,102
Same thing with the kissing contest.

584
00:43:49,166 --> 00:43:51,368
You wanted to teach him a lesson?

585
00:43:51,433 --> 00:43:53,268
Yeah,

586
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:55,401
l saw how he was treating you.

587
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,734
l wanted to show him that

588
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:01,603
you don't have to come on
so tetosterony to be a man.

589
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:07,368
Thanks, l guess.

590
00:44:07,433 --> 00:44:10,102
( loud snoring )

591
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,170
l have another lesson
to teach Harley.

592
00:44:17,466 --> 00:44:20,735
( snoring continues )

593
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,635
( giggling )

594
00:44:36,867 --> 00:44:38,501
What are you doing?

595
00:44:38,566 --> 00:44:40,534
Nothing, l'm just waking you up.

596
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,601
lt's Adam's turn for some shut eye.

597
00:44:47,633 --> 00:44:48,934
( laughíng )

598
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,968
Harley: Why díd god ínvent
shoppíng carts?

599
00:44:51,032 --> 00:44:52,600
Sarah: l don't know, why?

600
00:44:52,666 --> 00:44:55,101
To teach women
how to walk on their hind legs.

601
00:44:55,166 --> 00:44:57,401
( Sarah laughs )

602
00:45:02,767 --> 00:45:04,935
Guys, this town
isn't even on the map.

603
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,702
Sure you didn't take
a wrong turn?

604
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:31,434
Harley: You know, l can please
three women at once.

605
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:35,003
- Sarah: Oh, yeah, in your dreams.
- Yeah, l do it with my toes.

606
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:39,536
Sarah:
Cheers to that.

607
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,068
Look at these yokels.

608
00:45:45,133 --> 00:45:47,401
Look at these hillbillies
putting on a pair of socks

609
00:45:47,466 --> 00:45:50,402
as their equipment
to putting on a three-pieces suit.

610
00:45:52,533 --> 00:45:56,703
Hey, what are you staring at,
A-hole?

611
00:45:56,767 --> 00:45:58,902
( both laughíng )

612
00:45:58,967 --> 00:46:00,401
Harley, quiet!

613
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:04,236
l'll be quiet if you let me
give you another kiss.

614
00:46:04,299 --> 00:46:08,870
And l'll kiss you on your neck
or anyplace else you'd like me to.

615
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:11,268
No, thanks.

616
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:15,103
Ah, Come on, l can be
just as charming as Adam here, okay?

617
00:46:15,166 --> 00:46:17,201
Check out
my suave sense of humor.

618
00:46:17,266 --> 00:46:20,636
- ( flatulence)
- ( laughing) That's not funny.

619
00:46:22,967 --> 00:46:25,035
Would you like to dance,
little old lady?

620
00:46:25,099 --> 00:46:27,534
Oh no, thanks.

621
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,601
No, l think you'd like to dance.

622
00:46:31,933 --> 00:46:33,968
You heard the lady.

623
00:46:34,032 --> 00:46:37,368
She's not interested.

624
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:42,769
l wasn't talking to you,
Pre_ boy.

625
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:44,467
( screams )

626
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:50,638
What? Me dancing with this girl
is gonna ruin your ménage à trois?

627
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:55,937
Hey, let's take this dance
to the back of my truck.

628
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,001
Yeah.

629
00:46:58,066 --> 00:46:59,901
You see these hands?

630
00:47:01,099 --> 00:47:04,001
- Now, watch out for my foot.
- ( grunt )

631
00:47:04,066 --> 00:47:07,402
- ( Harley cheering)
Whoo!

632
00:47:07,466 --> 00:47:10,101
You just got beat up by a girl.

633
00:47:10,166 --> 00:47:10,666
Harley:
That guy was such a dick.

634
00:47:13,767 --> 00:47:16,703
He was a big guy,
he was a big dick.

635
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:20,137
l just can't believe
you let Sarah kick his ass.

636
00:47:20,199 --> 00:47:23,902
Adam?
Adam, where did you go?

637
00:47:23,967 --> 00:47:26,102
Here.

638
00:47:26,166 --> 00:47:28,201
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

639
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:43,636
l can't understand
why you're being so nice to me.

640
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:46,903
lt's nice being nice to the nice.

641
00:47:48,399 --> 00:47:50,300
l don't know how you can say that,

642
00:47:50,366 --> 00:47:52,735
l'm not even man enough to stick up
for the girl l like.

643
00:47:54,767 --> 00:47:57,736
- You like me?
- Yeah.

644
00:48:02,266 --> 00:48:04,468
Then why don't you
do something about it?

645
00:48:06,433 --> 00:48:08,434
What?

646
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,935
Do you have a girlfriend?

647
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,035
No.

648
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:15,935
Well no, not really.

649
00:48:17,299 --> 00:48:20,201
l heard you and Harley
talking in the car.

650
00:48:20,266 --> 00:48:23,235
lt sounds like you really have a thing
for this Be_ Ann.

651
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,635
Yeah.

652
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:31,438
Listen, l'm not looking
for a commitment here.

653
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,468
l know.

654
00:48:33,533 --> 00:48:36,035
You know,

655
00:48:36,099 --> 00:48:39,202
a woman likes a man
with experience.

656
00:48:39,266 --> 00:48:42,335
Be_ Ann might like you better
if you were...

657
00:48:42,399 --> 00:48:44,400
a little more worldly.

658
00:48:44,466 --> 00:48:47,902
- Really?
- Yes.

659
00:48:47,967 --> 00:48:52,004
So, what are you waiting for?

660
00:48:52,066 --> 00:48:54,168
l'm afraid.

661
00:48:54,233 --> 00:48:57,202
Why? Do you think
that when a woman's the aggressor,

662
00:48:57,266 --> 00:49:00,869
that makes you less of a man.

663
00:49:00,933 --> 00:49:03,201
Yeah.

664
00:49:03,266 --> 00:49:07,703
Well no,
maybe it's not it, an_ays.

665
00:49:08,733 --> 00:49:11,602
Then what are you afraid of?

666
00:49:11,666 --> 00:49:14,735
Evemhing.

667
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,835
What if l'm not good?

668
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:22,603
Oh, you'll be good.
l know it.

669
00:49:53,666 --> 00:49:56,735
- Oh, l'm sory...
- What?

670
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,270
My nose bleed-- l've been
having it since l was a a kid.

671
00:50:00,333 --> 00:50:03,135
lt happens pre_ easily,
l'm-- sory.

672
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:06,001
Oh, here,

673
00:50:06,066 --> 00:50:09,235
let nurse Sarah
take a look at that.

674
00:50:09,299 --> 00:50:12,101
( both chuckle )

675
00:50:14,833 --> 00:50:17,635
You've got a little bit
on your face.

676
00:50:22,433 --> 00:50:25,302
Here, let me kiss that
and make it all better.

677
00:50:27,433 --> 00:50:30,135
Mmm.

678
00:50:44,433 --> 00:50:46,401
ls that better?

679
00:50:46,466 --> 00:50:49,168
Much.

680
00:50:51,666 --> 00:50:53,734
Are you really a virgin?

681
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,135
Yeah.

682
00:50:57,967 --> 00:50:59,968
l can't believe that--

683
00:51:00,032 --> 00:51:02,267
a handsome guy like you.

684
00:51:02,333 --> 00:51:06,070
( laughs)
It's true.

685
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:10,768
You swear?

686
00:51:10,833 --> 00:51:14,136
Yeah, l swear.

687
00:51:14,199 --> 00:51:16,601
( chuckles )

688
00:51:16,666 --> 00:51:19,268
That really turns me on.

689
00:51:28,533 --> 00:51:30,401
Whoo!

690
00:51:32,633 --> 00:51:34,601
You're so cute.

691
00:51:38,299 --> 00:51:40,567
P Hey, la, la, la ,la, la ,la, P

692
00:51:40,633 --> 00:51:42,334

693
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:44,768

694
00:51:44,833 --> 00:51:46,401

695
00:51:46,466 --> 00:51:48,801

696
00:51:48,867 --> 00:51:51,469

697
00:51:51,533 --> 00:51:54,168

698
00:51:54,233 --> 00:51:56,401
Okay, can we ty.

699
00:51:57,533 --> 00:52:01,770
Do or do not,
there is no tying.

700
00:52:01,833 --> 00:52:03,501
Huh?

701
00:52:03,566 --> 00:52:06,969
Ooh! Vey white you
make me, young Jedi.

702
00:52:07,032 --> 00:52:08,600
( moaníng )

703
00:52:08,666 --> 00:52:12,503
lt's supposed to be fun.
Just go with it.

704
00:52:12,566 --> 00:52:14,234
And remember--

705
00:52:14,299 --> 00:52:17,068
size matters not.

706
00:52:30,299 --> 00:52:34,002
- ( moaning loudly)
- ( panting )

707
00:52:34,066 --> 00:52:37,602
You feel the force
blowing through you.

708
00:52:37,666 --> 00:52:41,202
( screaming )

709
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:58,537
- You know what l really love?
- Huh?

710
00:53:01,333 --> 00:53:04,035
Your root beer colored nipples.

711
00:53:04,099 --> 00:53:06,100
( laughs )

712
00:53:09,133 --> 00:53:10,968
( screams )

713
00:53:11,032 --> 00:53:12,666
What the hell is that?

714
00:53:12,733 --> 00:53:15,402
( screamíng contínues )

715
00:53:18,666 --> 00:53:21,268
- Somebody help me.
- What's going on?

716
00:53:22,233 --> 00:53:26,537
lt's definitely not Colonel Mustard
in the study with a candlestick.

717
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:30,136
- Sarah, wait!
- Oh, hell's bells.

718
00:53:32,366 --> 00:53:34,367
Sarah, it could be dangerous.

719
00:53:34,433 --> 00:53:39,137
( screamíng)
Somebody help me.

720
00:53:59,032 --> 00:54:01,667
( Sobbing and screaming )

721
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:34,736
( all screaming )

722
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,702
( políce radío chatter )

723
00:54:49,266 --> 00:54:53,136
You dang kids are up to your assholes
and elbows in trouble.

724
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:56,368
Ask the elbows what?

725
00:54:57,399 --> 00:54:59,300
We can't find a dang thing.

726
00:54:59,366 --> 00:55:02,502
Let alone some dead man
flattened like the coyote

727
00:55:02,566 --> 00:55:04,567
in some dang Road Runner cartoon.

728
00:55:04,633 --> 00:55:07,469
No, Sir, we saw that.
l swear it.

729
00:55:07,533 --> 00:55:09,534
You know what l think?

730
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:12,235
l think you're all pulling
some dang prank.

731
00:55:12,299 --> 00:55:14,100
l got a holler from upstate

732
00:55:14,166 --> 00:55:17,035
about a couple of boys
fitting your description.

733
00:55:17,099 --> 00:55:20,735
You leR a piece of dang road kill
in a motel room,

734
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:23,402
thinking it was pre_ dang funny.

735
00:55:23,466 --> 00:55:28,270
l got half a mind to haul you in
for wasting my time.

736
00:55:28,333 --> 00:55:31,602
We're not lying.
We saw the whole dang thing.

737
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:39,869
You angling to get in on some
drop the soap action, boy?

738
00:55:39,933 --> 00:55:42,068
'Cause if you are,

739
00:55:42,133 --> 00:55:45,803
l'll put you in with a whole cell
of hardy hard-ons.

740
00:55:45,867 --> 00:55:50,004
They'll stretch your ass out
till it looks like a spare tire.

741
00:55:51,032 --> 00:55:52,666
My advice to you

742
00:55:52,733 --> 00:55:57,170
is to get in your dang car
and get the hell out of my state

743
00:55:57,233 --> 00:56:01,036
before l put you in a place
where your nicknames will be

744
00:56:01,099 --> 00:56:04,635
Firestone and Uniroyal.

745
00:56:09,633 --> 00:56:13,169
So, this guy in a monster truck
has been following you for _o days?

746
00:56:13,233 --> 00:56:14,934
You got it, sister.

747
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,769
Boy, did l hitch a ride
with the wrong car.

748
00:56:19,099 --> 00:56:20,800
What are you doing, dude?

749
00:56:20,867 --> 00:56:22,735
l think l took a wrong turn.

750
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,602
Well, this is a pe_ect place
for old fuck face to nail us.

751
00:56:25,666 --> 00:56:28,835
- Fuck face.
- Yeah, you saw the guy.

752
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,668
His face was totally fucked up.

753
00:56:30,733 --> 00:56:32,935
Looked like someone
quilted his face together.

754
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,634
Wired his jaw shut, too.

755
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:37,002
So yeah, he's fuck face in my book,
so come on, let's go.

756
00:56:37,066 --> 00:56:40,335
Look, l can't turn back around.
Deputy Dang will throw us behind bars.

757
00:56:40,399 --> 00:56:42,768
lf we go this way,
we could run right into fuck face.

758
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:45,235
Look, l'm not going an_here
until we check the map.

759
00:56:57,466 --> 00:56:59,935
Come on, make a decision,
make a decision.

760
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,969
- Give him a second.
- Oh yeah, that's just great.

761
00:57:03,032 --> 00:57:05,968
Gang up on me now that you
and Studmeister General here

762
00:57:06,032 --> 00:57:07,800
have taken your male
and female juices

763
00:57:07,867 --> 00:57:11,503
and mixed them all together into
a flagrant smorgasbord of bodily soup.

764
00:57:11,566 --> 00:57:15,169
- Great.
- Flagrant smorgasbord?

765
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:18,535
( banging )

766
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:22,103
You are next.

767
00:57:22,166 --> 00:57:25,002
- What?
- You are next.

768
00:57:26,199 --> 00:57:28,734
Well, that's what it says
on your hood.

769
00:57:30,166 --> 00:57:32,601
See?

770
00:57:32,666 --> 00:57:35,101
You are next.

771
00:57:36,133 --> 00:57:38,468
Even if that
weren't on your hood,

772
00:57:38,533 --> 00:57:41,769
l'd tell you folks you shouldn't be
stopped out here on this road.

773
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:44,035
No siree Bob,

774
00:57:44,099 --> 00:57:47,035
not with the demon out there.

775
00:57:47,099 --> 00:57:49,201
What demon?

776
00:57:49,266 --> 00:57:53,570
The demon that did this to my arm.

777
00:57:55,032 --> 00:57:57,200
Look how he butchered me.

778
00:57:57,266 --> 00:57:59,067
What happened?

779
00:58:00,099 --> 00:58:01,867
Oh, yo, fuck that!

780
00:58:04,666 --> 00:58:08,736
l was out hunting,
l was aiming at a deer,

781
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:12,069
laying as still
as my granddaddy in his casket,

782
00:58:12,133 --> 00:58:15,536
when l feels this cold shadow
COMe OVel Me.

783
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:18,202
So l take a look see.

784
00:58:18,266 --> 00:58:21,836
And there's a man,
he's as big as a tree.

785
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:26,371
His face is a patchwork
of skin and stitches.

786
00:58:26,433 --> 00:58:30,737
l calls him demon because
he's the scariest thing l ever seen,

787
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:34,468
and nothing human
could be that strong.

788
00:58:34,533 --> 00:58:37,569
He liRs me up
like l was nothing.

789
00:58:37,633 --> 00:58:41,536
Knocks my head
against a tree limb, and l'm out.

790
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:46,071
When l wakes up
l'm still in the woods,

791
00:58:46,133 --> 00:58:49,503
but my arm's been sawed off.

792
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,234
lt's true.

793
00:58:52,299 --> 00:58:56,069
lt's happened to dozens others
the exact same way.

794
00:58:56,133 --> 00:58:59,202
Most of us too poor to leave.

795
00:58:59,266 --> 00:59:01,067
Me?

796
00:59:01,133 --> 00:59:03,568
l ain't afraid of him no more.

797
00:59:03,633 --> 00:59:06,736
He wanted to kill me,
he would have done and done it.

798
00:59:08,099 --> 00:59:12,036
No, he's through with me.
He needs fresh meat.

799
00:59:12,099 --> 00:59:14,534
Fresh meat, l tell you.

800
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,234
So take my advice.

801
00:59:16,299 --> 00:59:19,735
You best not mosey
along this road, you hear?

802
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:22,335
You heard him,
Iet's not mosey along this road.

803
00:59:22,399 --> 00:59:25,869
- Yeah.
- Good day, folks.

804
00:59:25,933 --> 00:59:28,168
Good day.

805
00:59:32,233 --> 00:59:34,301
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh, what?

806
00:59:34,366 --> 00:59:36,134
l don't wanna freak you out
or anything ,

807
00:59:36,199 --> 00:59:38,100
- but we're almost out of gas.
- Sarah: What?

808
00:59:38,166 --> 00:59:41,002
- How can we almost get out of gas?
- l don't know. The needle dropped.

809
00:59:41,066 --> 00:59:43,234
- It must've been sticking.
- Oh, this is not good.

810
00:59:43,299 --> 00:59:46,368
- This is not good at all.
- Guys, what's that?

811
00:59:47,633 --> 00:59:50,635
- Adam: It's )ust a scarecrow.
- If it is, well...

812
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:52,835
Why isn't it protecting
some farmer's cornfield

813
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:55,769
instead of standing there
in the middle of the road?

814
01:00:18,967 --> 01:00:22,070
- What are you doing?
- l'm making a pact with God.

815
01:00:22,133 --> 01:00:24,702
lf he spares us,
l promise not to be an A- hole anymore.

816
01:00:24,767 --> 01:00:28,003
- (thud, )
- Oh, Jeez, on the road.

817
01:00:28,066 --> 01:00:30,935
( screaming )

818
01:00:35,867 --> 01:00:38,970
- How you doing?
- ( all laugh )

819
01:00:51,299 --> 01:00:53,334
This road
is really creeping me out.

820
01:00:54,566 --> 01:00:58,069
Hey guys, guys, look.
Check it out.

821
01:00:58,133 --> 01:01:00,668
All ríght,
ít looks líke they got gas.

822
01:01:03,166 --> 01:01:07,103
Hey Sarah, let me show you
what l can really do wíth my mouth.

823
01:01:07,166 --> 01:01:09,568
Check ít out.

824
01:01:09,633 --> 01:01:11,601
Sarah:
Jesus, slow down.

825
01:01:11,666 --> 01:01:13,501
You're gonna get brain freeze.

826
01:01:17,666 --> 01:01:20,735
( belching )

827
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,735
Oh, that hits the spot.

828
01:01:24,633 --> 01:01:26,835
You know that soda
contains a lot of fructose?

829
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:30,303
- Yeah, so?
- Well did you that 950/o

830
01:01:30,366 --> 01:01:33,001
of a man's ejaculate is fructose?

831
01:01:33,066 --> 01:01:34,734
lt's totally true.

832
01:01:35,767 --> 01:01:38,636
- Well, what are you tying to say?
- ( laughs )

833
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:43,302
Hey, you know, l don't think
l like what you're implying there.

834
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,067
Oh, food's here.

835
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:51,200
Oh, thank you so much.

836
01:01:51,266 --> 01:01:55,136
So, how do things with you and Sarah
affect the way you feel about Be_ Ann?

837
01:01:55,199 --> 01:01:57,668
( sighs)
l don't know.

838
01:01:57,733 --> 01:02:00,569
You know, l got another day
before we get to the wedding.

839
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:02,267
l hope to figure it out
before then.

840
01:02:02,333 --> 01:02:04,902
Well, whatever you decide man,
l'm behind you.

841
01:02:04,967 --> 01:02:07,736
You know, if you go for Be_ Ann,
more power to you.

842
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:11,637
lf you decide on Sarah,
well, that's cool too.

843
01:02:14,099 --> 01:02:16,234
l'm really sory
about evemhing l did, man.

844
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:20,603
You know, l'm the type of guy
who puts the ''ick'' in the word dick.

845
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:35,071
Okay, guys, there's nothing that a bowl
of chili and a hamburger can't fix.

846
01:02:36,266 --> 01:02:37,900
Mmm.

847
01:02:41,133 --> 01:02:44,302
All right guys, from now on
we stop only for gas.

848
01:02:44,366 --> 01:02:47,702
Drive straight through.
If l get tired, we'll switch off.

849
01:02:55,199 --> 01:02:58,168
( gagging )

850
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:13,336
Oh, dude,
l think you just ate somebody.

851
01:03:16,366 --> 01:03:19,001
Oh, this is not good,
this is not good!

852
01:03:19,066 --> 01:03:20,901
( screaming )

853
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:26,102
- Harley, come on.

854
01:03:34,099 --> 01:03:37,702
Adam: l can't belíeve that happened.
There were people ín my chílí.

855
01:03:37,767 --> 01:03:39,368
- ( panting)
- An eyeball!

856
01:03:41,166 --> 01:03:45,570
- l can't believe what just happened.
- Goddamm it, l ate somebody.

857
01:03:45,633 --> 01:03:48,535
There's a dead guy
in the back seat.

858
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:50,268
( screaming )

859
01:03:52,933 --> 01:03:54,567
Oh, God!

860
01:03:55,967 --> 01:03:57,802
Jesus.

861
01:03:57,867 --> 01:04:01,203
- Get it out of here, Adam.
- You're in the back, you get rid of it.

862
01:04:01,266 --> 01:04:03,768
lt's your car, ''major domo,''
you get rid of it.

863
01:04:10,299 --> 01:04:12,100
Oh shit, it's fuck face.

864
01:04:15,867 --> 01:04:17,668
We're all gonna die.

865
01:04:17,733 --> 01:04:21,269
l definitely hitched a ride
with the wrong car.

866
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:31,302
l can't outrun it.

867
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:41,469
- Do something, Adam, do something!
- l'm open to suggestions.

868
01:04:59,533 --> 01:05:02,602
Adam, hury,

875
01:05:52,199 --> 01:05:54,200
( screaming )

876
01:05:55,266 --> 01:05:59,303
Sarah: Get ít sta_ed,

- Do you think we lost him?
- Yeah, sure.

901
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:48,602

01:14:49,233 --> 01:14:51,902
Move, you dumb ass, move.

931
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:01,669
Good, you're almost there.
We gotta get out of here.

932
01:15:10,299 --> 01:15:12,467
( screaming )

933
01:15:16,066 --> 01:15:18,001
Give me the shovel.

934
01:15:18,066 --> 01:15:19,700
( laughing )

935
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:33,768
( laughing )

936
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:37,201
Man:
Welcome míend.

937
01:15:37,266 --> 01:15:40,769
l'm so glad you could be here
with us tonight.

938
01:15:40,833 --> 01:15:43,035
- Go to hell.
- l already did.

939
01:15:43,099 --> 01:15:44,934
And that's why l'm here
with you today.

940
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,436
Actually, l have my sister
Sarah here to thank, too.

941
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:52,237
lndeed you do, brother Fred,
indeed you do.

942
01:15:52,299 --> 01:15:55,602
You're probably wondering
why we've brought you here.

943
01:15:55,666 --> 01:16:00,070
See, brother Bob
was driving his truck around,

944
01:16:00,133 --> 01:16:04,270
blasting his music,
acting all macho while off roading.

945
01:16:04,333 --> 01:16:06,935
But he was basically drunk
on his own testosterone.

946
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,902
Which makes a fellow
do terrible things sometimes,

947
01:16:09,967 --> 01:16:11,635
l always say.

948
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:15,236
Anyhows,
brother Bob doesn't see me

949
01:16:15,299 --> 01:16:17,868
taking a leak over near the creek,

950
01:16:17,933 --> 01:16:20,268
he done clean runs me over.

951
01:16:20,333 --> 01:16:21,901
Sarah: Bobby heard
the thump, though.

952
01:16:21,967 --> 01:16:24,035
He turns around
and sees his brother Fred

953
01:16:24,099 --> 01:16:25,767
looking deader
than Robert E. Lee.

954
01:16:29,333 --> 01:16:32,402
But he doesn't notice
the tree up ahead.

955
01:16:32,466 --> 01:16:34,801
- ( giggling)
- Wham.

956
01:16:34,867 --> 01:16:39,037
Next thing brother Bob knows,
he's flying through the windshield.

957
01:16:39,099 --> 01:16:40,467
Brother Bob survived, though.

958
01:16:40,533 --> 01:16:43,335
And l was able
to sew him back together.

959
01:16:43,399 --> 01:16:47,736
Brother Bob, will you go prepare
the Satan's blood.

960
01:16:52,032 --> 01:16:54,534
l was a different stoy.

961
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:58,870
Luckily, sister Sarah's studying
witchcraR.

962
01:16:58,933 --> 01:17:03,137
She starts praying to the devil,

963
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:05,634
and praise Satan

964
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:09,070
'cause l done rise
from the dead.

965
01:17:09,133 --> 01:17:11,702
But there's a catch.

966
01:17:11,767 --> 01:17:14,503
For brother Fred
to stay alive,

967
01:17:14,566 --> 01:17:17,235
our lord Lucifer
needs a sacrifice.

968
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:21,002
So evey full moon,
brother Bob must go out

969
01:17:21,066 --> 01:17:25,069
and run someone down,
just like he did me.

970
01:17:25,133 --> 01:17:27,702
That explains the guy
he mowed down behind the motel.

971
01:17:27,767 --> 01:17:30,269
You catch on quick, boy.

972
01:17:30,333 --> 01:17:33,235
An_ays, once brother Bob
has done his work,

973
01:17:33,299 --> 01:17:35,868
sister Sarah
does what she does.

974
01:17:35,933 --> 01:17:39,870
Chanting and drawing
her fancy stars.

975
01:17:39,933 --> 01:17:43,703
- Pentagrams.
- Sory sis, pentagrams.

976
01:17:43,767 --> 01:17:47,137
Anyhows, the lífe energy

977
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:49,935
of that poor soul
that brother Bob flattened,

978
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,436
goes and restores me.

979
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:56,870
l was not a pretty pícture.

980
01:17:56,933 --> 01:18:01,370
The bones in my arms and legs
were shattered-- lost an eye, too.

981
01:18:01,433 --> 01:18:04,636
l was nothing but a rag doll, really.

982
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:09,004
Until Sarah started
experimenting sewing

983
01:18:09,066 --> 01:18:11,735
other people's arms
and legs onto me.

984
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:15,603
Well, we couldn't just kill
peoples and take their limbs, no.

985
01:18:17,133 --> 01:18:19,301
No, we discovered
we had to let them live

986
01:18:19,366 --> 01:18:22,869
if we wanted
my new arm or leg to take.

987
01:18:22,933 --> 01:18:26,136
Yeah, we met some of your friends
you borrowed from.

988
01:18:26,199 --> 01:18:29,235
Yeah, but it's too bad we couldn't
borrow a torso that would work.

989
01:18:29,299 --> 01:18:32,735
Always turned
ínto a bloody goddamn mess.

990
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,635
That's where you come in.

991
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:37,402
Sarah found a new book
of spells and such.

992
01:18:37,466 --> 01:18:40,535
She found l could have me
a whole new body

993
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:43,135
if it were prepared right.

994
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:46,135
- Prepared right?
- Yeah.

995
01:18:46,199 --> 01:18:48,801
This devil's manual
Sarah came by

996
01:18:48,867 --> 01:18:51,703
explains that with
the right rituals

997
01:18:51,767 --> 01:18:54,536
and the correct
dark ceremonies

998
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:58,603
prior to slicing and dicing
and hitching and stitching,

999
01:18:58,666 --> 01:19:02,436
we wouldn't have the problems we've had
before attaching a torso to me.

1000
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:06,303
My brother
is getting your body, Adam.

1001
01:19:06,366 --> 01:19:09,836
( laughíng )

1002
01:19:15,633 --> 01:19:17,267
What's this, huh?

1003
01:19:17,333 --> 01:19:19,468
What, you gonna leave
before the pam starts?

1004
01:19:19,533 --> 01:19:21,268
Fred:
You should be honored.

1005
01:19:21,333 --> 01:19:24,135
Sarah picked you out
from the get go.

1006
01:19:24,199 --> 01:19:26,367
lt was you in the hearse,
wasn't it?

1007
01:19:26,433 --> 01:19:28,468
Sizing me up?

1008
01:19:30,066 --> 01:19:33,702
We needed someone pliable.

1009
01:19:33,767 --> 01:19:37,303
Someone easy to prepare.

1010
01:19:37,366 --> 01:19:39,534
And that you were.

1011
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:43,971
Step one, we needed
a body to voluntarily

1012
01:19:44,032 --> 01:19:47,769
step inside a pentagram
with a decapitated body.

1013
01:19:47,833 --> 01:19:50,035
Shit, the trailer home.

1014
01:19:51,933 --> 01:19:54,068
Oh shit is right.

1015
01:19:54,133 --> 01:19:57,135
Phase _o, we needed you
to sleep with road kill.

1016
01:19:58,533 --> 01:20:02,003
ltem three and four came easy.

1017
01:20:02,066 --> 01:20:03,767
My favorite.

1018
01:20:03,833 --> 01:20:07,236
Sarah needed
to taste your blood,

1019
01:20:07,299 --> 01:20:09,067
and take your virginity.

1020
01:20:10,099 --> 01:20:12,901
Four times just to be sure.

1021
01:20:12,967 --> 01:20:16,970
Shut up, Sarah,
you're making me jealous.

1022
01:20:17,032 --> 01:20:19,234
What was the last thing?
l had to eat the dead?

1023
01:20:19,299 --> 01:20:21,100
Fred:
Almost last thíng.

1024
01:20:21,166 --> 01:20:23,368
The final step in preparing you
was simple.

1025
01:20:23,433 --> 01:20:25,301
You had to be scared to death.

1026
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:30,136
l think brother Bob did a fine job
of doing that.

1027
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:33,635
l want to thank you
for letting me have

1028
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:36,936
your beautiful body,
young man.

1029
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,968
l only have one question,

1030
01:20:39,032 --> 01:20:42,101
you díddled my síster
wíth that body,

1031
01:20:42,166 --> 01:20:43,800
so when l get your body,

1032
01:20:43,867 --> 01:20:47,370
does that mean
l fucked my own sister?

1033
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,235
Stop worying about that,
brother Fred.

1034
01:20:52,299 --> 01:20:54,401
When you're all brand new,

1035
01:20:54,466 --> 01:20:56,968
l'll do something to make
that a moot point.

1036
01:21:06,133 --> 01:21:07,734
Shall we begin?

1037
01:21:08,767 --> 01:21:12,971
Goodbye, Adam.
You'll always be a part of me.

1038
01:21:14,833 --> 01:21:17,368
( laughíng )

1039
01:21:29,366 --> 01:21:31,568
l take it back,
l never liked the color of your eyes.

1040
01:21:34,733 --> 01:21:37,735
He's getting away,
he's getting away.

1041
01:21:40,967 --> 01:21:42,368
( screaming )

1042
01:21:42,433 --> 01:21:46,136
l need that body, l gotta have
that body, don't let hím get away.

1043
01:21:47,166 --> 01:21:49,201
( screaming )

1044
01:22:04,466 --> 01:22:06,434
( screaming )

1045
01:22:09,366 --> 01:22:10,967
Oww.

1046
01:22:11,032 --> 01:22:12,633
Now your name
really is fuck face.

1047
01:22:15,633 --> 01:22:18,869
( all grunting )

1048
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:44,702
( laughing )

1049
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:49,635
( screaming )

1050
01:22:50,833 --> 01:22:52,801
( screaming )

1051
01:22:56,299 --> 01:22:58,034
How's that for prepared right?

1052
01:22:58,099 --> 01:23:00,768
( screaming intensifies )

1053
01:23:04,433 --> 01:23:06,768
Drop dead, Fred.

1054
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:15,604
Fuck you!

1055
01:23:37,166 --> 01:23:40,502
Looking for this, boy?

1056
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:58,169
Oh, you may be quiet
as a church mouse,

1057
01:24:00,166 --> 01:24:03,135
but you'll soon make a mistake.

1058
01:24:05,767 --> 01:24:07,969
and then l'll get you.

1059
01:24:19,767 --> 01:24:24,204
l'm not dead yet,
but l'm gonna be soon.

1060
01:24:24,266 --> 01:24:27,769
And you're gonna be
joining me.

1061
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:32,235
( laughíng )

1062
01:24:32,299 --> 01:24:34,668
( mumbles )

1063
01:24:42,299 --> 01:24:44,334
You're bleeding.

1064
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:49,935
ls the little wussy hurt?

1065
01:24:54,099 --> 01:24:57,702
l got a sixth sense for blood,
wussy boy.

1066
01:24:58,833 --> 01:25:01,869
lt's my own special radar.

1067
01:25:03,566 --> 01:25:08,037
And the more blood there is,
the stronger l'm drawn to it.

1068
01:25:11,166 --> 01:25:14,736
There's no hiding from me now,
wussy boy.

1069
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:17,569
( growling )

1070
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,968
( laughing )

1071
01:25:58,299 --> 01:26:01,235
Oh, you're bleeding badly now.

1072
01:26:04,633 --> 01:26:07,035
( laughing )

1073
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:14,536
( screaming )

1074
01:26:30,166 --> 01:26:32,268
Where's that goddamn key?

1075
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:35,201
Who's the wussy now?

1076
01:27:21,266 --> 01:27:23,534
Who, Adam!
Hey, Adam.

1077
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:26,402
Hey, l take it all back,
buddy.

1078
01:27:26,466 --> 01:27:28,301
You're not a complete wussy.

1079
01:27:28,366 --> 01:27:31,102
Harley?
l thought you were dead.

1080
01:27:31,166 --> 01:27:33,868
Hey, just hand over
that Academy Award, baby.

1081
01:27:33,933 --> 01:27:36,468
- ( both laughing)
- You want to drive?

1082
01:27:41,933 --> 01:27:43,701
Yeah.

1083
01:28:29,700 --> 01:28:31,334
Hey, Adam,

1084
01:28:31,399 --> 01:28:33,834
Adam, hey.

1085
01:28:38,333 --> 01:28:39,967
What?

1086
01:28:41,533 --> 01:28:43,835
l think you got him.

1087
01:28:46,133 --> 01:28:48,301
Hey, Harley,

1088
01:28:48,366 --> 01:28:50,468
thanks for coming back
and helping me, man.

1089
01:28:50,533 --> 01:28:53,035
l mean not just now, today,

1090
01:28:53,099 --> 01:28:55,167
l mean the whole trip.

1091
01:28:55,233 --> 01:28:58,302
You really are a good friend.

1092
01:28:58,366 --> 01:29:00,067
lt's no problem, bro.

1093
01:29:01,266 --> 01:29:03,768
This is probably getting
a little swishy, isn't it?

1094
01:29:03,833 --> 01:29:06,035
Yeah, just a little bit.

1095
01:29:06,099 --> 01:29:09,869
But speaking of swishy,
l got you a little present.

1096
01:29:13,666 --> 01:29:14,933
l like that.

1097
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,236
So, if you drive like a maniac, we can
still make it to Be_ Ann's wedding.

1098
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:22,903
- Screw Be_ Ann.
- Excuse me?

1099
01:29:22,967 --> 01:29:25,069
l don't really think
she's my type anymore.

1100
01:29:25,133 --> 01:29:27,735
Well then let's go pick up
some poontang.

1101
01:29:29,266 --> 01:29:31,368
Come on, man,
what are you waiting for?

1102
01:29:31,433 --> 01:29:33,067
Start up this bad boy.

1103
01:29:37,199 --> 01:29:39,167
Harley:
Whoo-ho!

1104
01:29:39,233 --> 01:29:41,935
Whoo-ho!

1105
01:30:00,466 --> 01:30:03,268
( faint groaning )

1106
01:30:06,366 --> 01:30:08,334
Wussies.

1107
01:30:08,399 --> 01:30:11,969
You can't kill me,

1108
01:30:12,032 --> 01:30:16,603
you can't kill me,
wussies.

1109
01:30:16,666 --> 01:30:20,803
You can't kill me.

1110
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:27,035
Fred:
The e_d?

1111
01:30:27,099 --> 01:30:30,936
This can't be the end.

1112
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,935
l'm still alive,

1113
01:30:34,433 --> 01:30:38,336
and l was gonna fuck my sister.

1114
01:30:39,833 --> 01:30:42,068
Now what am l gonna do?

1115
01:30:42,133 --> 01:30:44,401
Oh God!

1116
01:30:46,066 --> 01:30:48,568
( sobbing )

1117
01:30:50,533 --> 01:30:53,435
This sucks.
