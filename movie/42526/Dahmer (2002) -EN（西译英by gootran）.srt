11
00:02:16,261 -> 00:02:20,182
The basic thing is to ensure that the wraps are aligned ...

14
00:02:30,275 -> 00:02:32,194
Have you worked well before?

00:02:32,277 -> 00:02:35,197

19
00:04:40,280 -> 00:04:42,241

'I buy them.
- Why? 

23
00:05:02,302 -> 00:05:07,266
Because I like doing things good. It makes me feel good. 

24
00:05:08,308 -> 00:05:09,184
Are you crazy? 

25
00:05:12,229 -> 00:05:14,147
-How sad.
- What? 

26
00:05:14,231 -> 00:05:18,193
Do good things for the others is considered mad. 

27
00:05:22,239 -> 00:05:23,198
I'm going. 

28
00:05:25,242 -> 00:05:27,202

00:05:38,255 -> 00:05:42,176
I'll buy you shoes and let take some pictures. 

33
00:05:42,259 -> 00:05:44,219
What kind of pictures? 

34
00:05:47,264 -> 00:05:52,186
Just some pictures of you doing muscle, in a chair ... 

35
00:05:52,269 -> 00:05:54,229
Looking ... rough. 

36
00:05:56,273 -> 00:05:57,191
I ... 

37
00:05:57,274 -> 00:05:58,233

00:06:00,277 -> 00:06:02,237

44
00:08:35,224 -> 00:08:37,226
Can you remove your shirt? 

45
00:08:39,228 -> 00:08:40,229

-Take me to my house.
He's drunk. 

51
00:14:31,246 -> 00:14:35,209
I've never seen anyone like that.
I do not know why you believe it ... 

52
00:14:39,254 -> 00:14:41,173
Do you think you are right?

55
00:14:48,263 -> 00:14:51,266

109
00:20:12,254 -> 00:20:13,255
Auyижntalo. 

110
00:21:46,306 -> 00:21:51,186
I think your grandmother is very kind enough to leave you here without ...

00:22:10,247 -> 00:22:12,207
Yes, do what I can. 

117
00:22:14,251 -> 00:22:17,212
Right. Jeffrey ...there is. 

118
00:22:23,260 -> 00:22:28,223
Your grandmother said he had a dummy in your closet ... 

119
00:22:32,269 -> 00:22:34,188
So what?What is the problem? 

120
00:22:34,271 -> 00:22:36,231
Nothing was altered. 

121
00:22:38,275 -> 00:22:40,235
And I also I was disturbed. 

122
00:22:42,279 -> 00:22:45,199
Look, if you want to review the drawers ... 

123
00:22:45,282 -> 00:22:48,202
'No I'm getting ...Do ... go ahead. 

124
00:22:48,285 -> 00:22:52,206
No one is getting into.Your grandmother came here to put ... 

125
00:22:52,289 -> 00:22:56,210
Her quilts ... and dropped her
Dummy up. He was frightened. 

126
00:22:56,293 -> 00:22:58,253
I'm sorry. What to do? 

127
00:22:59,296 -> 00:23:02,216
A mannequin in the closet.
What's wrong? 

128
00:23:02,299 -> 00:23:03,258
That is rare. 

129
00:23:04,301 -> 00:23:06,261
Do not you think? 

130
00:23:09,264 -> 00:23:11,225
He said he was dressed ... 

131
00:23:13,268 -> 00:23:16,230
'So he came.
- So come? Have you sent him? 

132
00:23:19,274 -> 00:23:20,234
All right. 

133
00:23:22,277 -> 00:23:24,238
You know what, Dad?
It is .. 

134
00:23:27,282 -> 00:23:30,244
It is .. I did something stupid. 

135
00:23:32,287 -> 00:23:34,164
I saw that figure and I thought ... 

136
00:23:34,289 -> 00:23:38,168
... It could be a challenge steal it, no one ... 

137
00:23:38,293 -> 00:23:40,254
I ... see. A prank. 

138
00:23:41,296 -> 00:23:43,173
Do you still have it? 

139
00:23:43,298 -> 00:23:46,176
Yes I will return and that's it. 

140
00:23:46,301 -> 00:23:49,263
- I can see it?
'It's just a mannequin, Dad. 

141
00:23:50,305 -> 00:23:52,266
Plastic people with clothing. 

142
00:23:53,308 -> 00:23:56,186
'Do not be sarcastic.
- I am not! 

143
00:23:56,311 -> 00:23:59,273
Calm down. Let's be rational. 

144
00:24:00,315 -> 00:24:04,194
Why not go down and we to church? I will be attentive and ... 

145
00:24:04,319 -> 00:24:07,197
And return the dummy ...everything will be fine. 

146
00:24:07,322 -> 00:24:11,159
What I want to do now is to return the dummy ... 

147
00:24:11,243 -> 00:24:13,161
You stole it ... from where. 

148
00:24:13,245 -> 00:24:17,207
OK. The clothing store is to be closed, but come on. 

149
00:24:20,252 -> 00:24:22,212
- Are you there?
Yes, in the closet. 

150
00:24:36,268 -> 00:24:39,229
Take it to the store path to church. 

151
00:24:46,278 -> 00:24:47,237
Idiot. 

152
00:24:52,284 -> 00:24:55,245
Is my old box of chemistry? 

153
00:24:57,289 -> 00:24:58,248
Where was I? 

154
00:24:59,291 -> 00:25:00,250
Let's go. 

155
00:25:01,293 -> 00:25:02,211
Is closed. 

156
00:25:02,294 -> 00:25:06,215
- What are you doing here?
- Do you remember this? 

157
00:25:06,298 -> 00:25:09,134
Are you kidding? Is the box
Pandora. 

158
00:25:09,218 -> 00:25:12,137
Do you know who was Pandora, Jeff? 

159
00:25:12,221 -> 00:25:14,139
Yes, I know the story. 

160
00:25:14,223 -> 00:25:17,142
You never knew what when your father would ... 

161
00:25:17,226 -> 00:25:21,146
... Opened that box.
- Do you still have something inside? 

162
00:25:21,230 -> 00:25:23,148
It was empty when the suit. 

163
00:25:23,232 -> 00:25:26,151
I put my things there.
Any problem? 

164
00:25:26,235 -> 00:25:30,155
No problem. I just wanted see if there was something of mine. 

165
00:25:30,239 -> 00:25:31,240
It was empty. 

166
00:25:34,243 -> 00:25:37,162
- And the key, Jeff?
'I tell you it was empty. 

167
00:25:37,246 -> 00:25:39,248
Nothing is yours there. 

168
00:25:40,249 -> 00:25:44,169
Well, yes it should. He had a secret compartment ... 

169
00:25:44,253 -> 00:25:48,173
... And had a small ring I gave my first girlfriend. 

170
00:25:48,257 -> 00:25:50,259
I wanted to see if she was there. 

171
00:25:51,260 -> 00:25:55,180
No, I opened the compartment and it was empty. 

172
00:25:55,264 -> 00:25:58,267
Why not open it? Give me the key. 

173
00:26:03,272 -> 00:26:05,274
I told you, Dad. 

174
00:26:06,275 -> 00:26:07,276
It is the height. 

175
00:26:08,277 -> 00:26:10,195
I have no 12. 

176
00:26:12,239 -> 00:26:16,118
This is your home but not I have privacy ... 

177
00:26:16,243 -> 00:26:18,120
... Not worth being here. 

178
00:26:18,245 -> 00:26:21,123
Stop exaggerating and feel sorry for you. 

179
00:26:21,248 -> 00:26:25,127
-You have the right to privacy.
-Iижsta is my damn box ... 

180
00:26:25,252 -> 00:26:27,129
I see what you ...is inside! 

181
00:26:27,254 -> 00:26:29,131
Do not be childish, Lionel. 

182
00:26:29,256 -> 00:26:33,135
We go to church. And then talk about this. 

183
00:26:33,260 -> 00:26:36,138
Jeffrey, open it or I try to do. 

184
00:26:36,263 -> 00:26:38,223
Whatever. I'm going. 

185
00:26:40,267 -> 00:26:42,227
Jeffrey, wait! Jeffrey! 

186
00:26:45,272 -> 00:26:47,149
This is my fault, not your father. 

187
00:26:47,274 -> 00:26:49,151
I'm sorry I started this. 

188
00:26:49,276 -> 00:26:51,236
It's not your fault, Grandma. 

189
00:26:54,281 -> 00:26:55,240
I will ... 

190
00:26:59,286 -> 00:27:00,162
Just ... 

191
00:27:00,287 -> 00:27:01,246
Finish ... 

192
00:27:03,290 -> 00:27:04,166
Yes? Come on. 

193
00:27:04,291 -> 00:27:06,168
- What is it?
Listen to me ... 

194
00:27:06,293 -> 00:27:08,253
- What is it?
'Listen ... 

195
00:27:11,215 -> 00:27:12,132
It is .. 

196
00:27:12,216 -> 00:27:15,177
Is ... pornographic material.Right? 

197
00:27:16,220 -> 00:27:18,180
Grandma did not want to see. 

198
00:27:19,223 -> 00:27:22,142
Why not low empty the box ... 

199
00:27:22,226 -> 00:27:26,146
... And you lay it.
-Better open it and go down together. 

200
00:27:26,230 -> 00:27:28,148
I'd rather not ... 

201
00:27:28,232 -> 00:27:30,192
Jeffrey, I hurt. 

202
00:27:31,235 -> 00:27:35,197
Sorry, Grandma, I did not intention. It was accidental. 

203
00:27:36,240 -> 00:27:37,199
Excuse me. 

204
00:27:38,242 -> 00:27:41,161
Dad, why do not you come down with Grandma? 

205
00:27:41,245 -> 00:27:43,163
I'll be down in a minute ... 

206
00:27:43,247 -> 00:27:44,206
... Right? 

207
00:27:46,250 -> 00:27:47,209
Please? 

208
00:27:51,255 -> 00:27:54,216
I do not understand what happens.
All right, Mom. Go. 

209
00:27:56,260 -> 00:27:58,220
I'm sorry, Grandma. 

210
00:28:36,258 -> 00:28:38,218
I have the key. Go up. 

211
00:29:00,282 -> 00:29:02,242
You said it was empty. 

212
00:29:04,286 -> 00:29:06,246
Yes Did you want that grandmother to see? 

213
00:29:09,208 -> 00:29:11,168
I'll get rid of them. 

214
00:29:13,212 -> 00:29:14,171
Is it OK? 

215
00:29:26,225 -> 00:29:27,184
Let's go. 

216
00:30:02,261 -> 00:30:04,221
?I can see that knife? 

217
00:30:05,264 -> 00:30:06,181
What? 

218
00:30:06,265 -> 00:30:08,225
-The red handle.
Ah, yes. 

219
00:30:09,268 -> 00:30:10,227
Insurance. 

220
00:30:12,271 -> 00:30:15,190
In fact, is a Fisherman knife. 

221
00:30:15,274 -> 00:30:18,193
See those circles? Help cut in line. 

222
00:30:18,277 -> 00:30:21,238
And this is good.
See how the blade is curved? 

223
00:30:22,281 -> 00:30:25,200
Used to get the bowels. 

224
00:30:25,284 -> 00:30:28,203
If you put it under his chin,the slice. 

225
00:30:28,287 -> 00:30:29,246
Check it out. 

226
00:30:31,290 -> 00:30:33,250
Do fish have chin? 

227
00:30:35,294 -> 00:30:40,257
Yes they have. Most do not knows. Indeed, it is around here ... 

228
00:30:42,301 -> 00:30:43,260
I'll show you ... 

229
00:30:47,306 -> 00:30:52,227
You see here? ? Under the mouth? It cree that the chin is here. 

230
00:30:52,311 -> 00:30:55,230
But no. It is here where the fins. 

231
00:30:55,314 -> 00:30:56,273
Are fins? 

232
00:30:59,318 -> 00:31:02,279
Well, I'm Picasso.
But I give you an idea. 

233
00:31:04,323 -> 00:31:07,242
-You know a lot of fishing.
Yes, sure. 

234
00:31:07,326 -> 00:31:09,244
I love fishing. 

235
00:31:10,245 -> 00:31:14,166
- Why do you like?
I do not know ... I guess ... 

236
00:31:14,249 -> 00:31:17,169
I like ... fool the fish.You know. 

237
00:31:17,252 -> 00:31:19,171
Going into his mind. 

238
00:31:19,254 -> 00:31:22,174
I bet you think are stupid, right? 

239
00:31:22,257 -> 00:31:26,178
So are small smart bastards. 

240
00:31:26,261 -> 00:31:30,182
Some grow and grow old. 

241
00:31:30,265 -> 00:31:32,184
There's a reason.You know what? 

242
00:31:32,267 -> 00:31:33,268
No. 

243
00:31:34,269 -> 00:31:37,272
They are smarter than us! 

244
00:31:39,274 -> 00:31:40,275
Really. 

245
00:31:45,280 -> 00:31:48,200
If you can not fish,What knife you looking for? 

246
00:31:48,283 -> 00:31:51,203
Surely you want a knife with teeth. 

247
00:31:51,286 -> 00:31:55,207
Right. What is the bigger than you? 

248
00:31:55,290 -> 00:31:57,209
Ah, yes. 

249
00:31:57,292 -> 00:31:59,294
This big man here. 

250
00:32:01,296 -> 00:32:02,297
See it. 

251
00:32:04,299 -> 00:32:06,301
- What is it?
I do not know. 

252
00:32:08,303 -> 00:32:09,221
Do not you know? 

253
00:32:10,264 -> 00:32:14,226
It does not really work here.I'm covering my cousin. 

254
00:32:15,269 -> 00:32:17,229
It was for food. 

255
00:32:19,273 -> 00:32:20,232
I cheated. 

256
00:32:23,277 -> 00:32:26,154
That knife does not know him.If you had ... 

257
00:32:26,280 -> 00:32:30,242
Chosen another ... would have had to invent something. 

258
00:32:37,291 -> 00:32:39,251
And when you get your cousin? 

259
00:32:41,295 -> 00:32:46,175
We'll be here a while until we finish and then ... 

260
00:32:46,300 -> 00:32:49,261
... Maybe go on a spree or something. 

261
00:32:52,306 -> 00:32:53,265
Do you want ... 

262
00:32:54,308 -> 00:32:56,268
Go home ... by few beers? 

263
00:33:02,316 -> 00:33:06,195
Bueno. Yes, okay, sounds good.Where do you live? 

264
00:33:06,320 -> 00:33:08,197
I live here. 

265
00:33:08,322 -> 00:33:09,156
Bueno. 

266
00:33:09,239 -> 00:33:11,200
What are you doing? 

267
00:33:12,242 -> 00:33:14,161
I am showing it to him. 

268
00:33:14,244 -> 00:33:17,164
It grips well. It will mess. 

269
00:33:17,247 -> 00:33:19,208
Can you calm down? 

270
00:33:20,250 -> 00:33:24,213
'Not I touched the blade.
I saw so. Give me the knife. 

271
00:33:25,255 -> 00:33:29,176
Quiet. Nor will stain.Ask the customer. 

272
00:33:29,259 -> 00:33:32,179
Lord, may tell you not fouled? 

273
00:33:32,262 -> 00:33:37,226
No, he did a good job.In fact, I would buy it. 

274
00:33:38,268 -> 00:33:40,187
Mmm. Bueno.

00:33:40,270 -> 00:33:41,230

You were just here.How is it going to buy. 

279
00:33:51,281 -> 00:33:55,244
'Oh, no, well I sold that.

Cheers. You have to eat all you want. 

295
00:35:06,315 -> 00:35:11,195
Yes, you get all that want, but then you get tired. 

296
00:35:12,237 -> 00:35:14,156
At times of smell makes me sick.

00:46:06,308 -> 00:46:09,186
- What are you doing there?
-I see your fish. 

329
00:46:12,231 -> 00:46:13,190
Are Betas. 

330
00:46:14,233 -> 00:46:18,195
I know. I bought some.Will we see fight? 

331
00:46:19,238 -> 00:46:22,199
No. The separated for not eat the other. 

332
00:46:24,243 -> 00:46:26,203
Have you seen piranhas? 

333
00:46:28,247 -> 00:46:31,166
'I've seen pictures.
-They are ugly bastards. 

334
00:46:31,250 -> 00:46:34,211
And they have some big teeth thus aligned. 

335
00:46:39,258 -> 00:46:43,220
Also have teeth above,but only see the bottom. 

336
00:46:47,266 -> 00:46:48,225
What is it? 

337
00:46:50,269 -> 00:46:51,228
Whiskey and tails. 

338
00:46:54,273 -> 00:46:56,191
Whiskey? 

339
00:46:56,275 -> 00:46:59,236
Gee, I do not like whiskey. 

340
00:47:01,280 -> 00:47:03,240
Almost everything is tail. 

341
00:47:12,207 -> 00:47:16,128
'I can put more soda.
'I'll take it. Nothing more ... 

342
00:47:16,211 -> 00:47:17,212
I ... stand. 

343
00:47:52,247 -> 00:47:54,249
Jeff ...I'll be at the hotel. 

344
00:47:56,251 -> 00:47:57,252
OK. 

345
00:47:59,254 -> 00:48:00,255
All is well. 

346
00:48:01,256 -> 00:48:02,257
Yes. 

347
00:48:03,258 -> 00:48:06,261
-I call you when it arrives.
'All right. 

348
00:48:07,262 -> 00:48:08,263
See you! 

349
00:48:50,264 -> 00:48:52,224
Hey, you're not a Buddhist, do you? 

350
00:48:53,267 -> 00:48:54,226
No. 

351
00:48:55,269 -> 00:48:59,147
I met a Buddhist, was 6 fingers on one hand. 

352
00:48:59,273 -> 00:49:03,151
No, I'm not. I have the normal amount of fingers, I think. 

353
00:49:03,277 -> 00:49:05,237
Yes, look. 

354
00:49:14,204 -> 00:49:17,124
Come on, Jeffrey. I can not talk all the time. 

355
00:49:17,207 -> 00:49:20,169
It's teamwork, you know. 

356
00:49:24,214 -> 00:49:25,132
Are you a ... 

357
00:49:25,215 -> 00:49:27,176
God fearing Christian ...? 

358
00:49:29,219 -> 00:49:33,140
Rather any Christian. I'm not going to church. 

359
00:49:33,223 -> 00:49:35,184
Why bring that cross? 

360
00:49:37,227 -> 00:49:38,187
This one? 

361
00:49:40,230 -> 00:49:41,190
It's my mom. 

362
00:49:45,235 -> 00:49:47,196
Yes you know what the cross, right? 

363
00:49:48,238 -> 00:49:51,200
-Where Jesus died.
-An instrument of torture. 

364
00:49:52,242 -> 00:49:54,203
Used to kill criminals. 

365
00:49:56,246 -> 00:49:58,165
When you pray is as if ... 

366
00:49:58,248 -> 00:50:01,210
... Go to the electric chair or the guillotine. 

367
00:50:02,252 -> 00:50:03,212
Are rare. 

368
00:50:06,256 -> 00:50:09,176
Rare is that in the church eat the body ... 

369
00:50:09,259 -> 00:50:12,221
Christ ... and drink their blood.'It's an expression. 

370
00:50:15,265 -> 00:50:18,227
- You think you got soul?
Of course. 

371
00:50:19,269 -> 00:50:23,232
Do you know? No pigeons beautify you when you die. 

372
00:50:24,274 -> 00:50:26,235
How many people have been killed? 

373
00:50:28,278 -> 00:50:31,240
Would you believe in the pigeon?It's your problem. 

374
00:50:32,282 -> 00:50:34,201
I'm not trying to convince anyone. 

375
00:50:34,284 -> 00:50:37,204
It is not really a pigeon. It is a dove. 

376
00:50:37,287 -> 00:50:40,207
I was sarcastic to understand it. 

377
00:50:40,290 -> 00:50:45,254
Yes, you are sarcastic. Why do not try to talk seriously? 

378
00:50:50,300 -> 00:50:52,261
Tell me a secret. 

379
00:50:56,306 -> 00:50:57,266
My secret is ... 

380
00:50:59,309 -> 00:51:01,270
... I wish you to be quiet. 

381
00:51:02,312 -> 00:51:05,274
So I first.
I almost crippled my aunt. 

382
00:51:10,279 -> 00:51:11,238
Oh, okay. 

383
00:51:12,281 -> 00:51:13,240
I hear you. 

384
00:51:14,283 -> 00:51:18,161
Bueno. The best friend of my
mom was this lady. 

385
00:51:18,287 -> 00:51:22,165
We called her Aunt Tess although was not, but it was a se?o ... 

386
00:51:22,291 -> 00:51:25,252
Expected. I almost you took you to your aunt. 

387
00:51:27,296 -> 00:51:30,174
Yes it was my aunt, but not was my blood. 

388
00:51:30,299 -> 00:51:34,261
Then the real story is you take you almost an old woman. 

389
00:51:36,305 -> 00:51:37,264
Well ... 

390
00:51:39,308 -> 00:51:41,185
If you wish, yes. 

391
00:51:41,310 -> 00:51:44,188
Almost an old cripple me. 

392
00:51:44,313 -> 00:51:47,191
But a good story.Do you want to hear or not? 

393
00:51:47,316 -> 00:51:48,275
Agreed. 

394
00:51:49,318 -> 00:51:51,195
Thank you. Well ... 

395
00:51:51,320 -> 00:51:55,199
Like I said, Aunt Tess was a type of woman ... 

396
00:51:55,324 -> 00:51:58,202
... Beautiful and sophisticated. 

397
00:51:58,327 -> 00:52:02,206
He spent some years in Europe, in Paris, and returned with a ... 

398
00:52:02,331 -> 00:52:04,291
French disc ... and garbage. 

399
00:52:09,254 -> 00:52:10,172
Who is it? 

400
00:52:10,255 -> 00:52:12,216
Mama. We're leaving. 

401
00:52:14,259 -> 00:52:15,219
All right. 

402
00:52:17,262 -> 00:52:19,223
Do you open the door, Jeffrey? 

403
00:52:22,267 -> 00:52:23,227
Do not bring clothes. 

404
00:52:26,271 -> 00:52:27,189
I leave ... 

405
00:52:27,272 -> 00:52:29,191
... $ 30. 

406
00:52:29,274 -> 00:52:32,236
If you run out,call your father. 

407
00:52:34,279 -> 00:52:37,199
'All right.
- Have the number? 

408
00:52:37,282 -> 00:52:40,244
-Yes.
- Sure you do not want to come? 

409
00:52:42,287 -> 00:52:43,247
Yes, sure. 

410
00:52:46,291 -> 00:52:47,209
Bueno. 

411
00:52:47,292 -> 00:52:49,253
We returned on Wednesday. 

412
00:55:35,252 -> 00:55:37,212
Then I said ... 

413
00:55:38,255 -> 00:55:40,174
... "Come to my house." 

414
00:55:40,257 -> 00:55:42,217
To learn. 

415
00:55:43,260 -> 00:55:44,219
Yes .. 

416
00:55:45,262 -> 00:55:49,183
Come on, baby, come on. It next is that we were ... 

417
00:55:49,266 -> 00:55:51,185
... At home. Straight to the room. 

418
00:55:51,268 -> 00:55:55,230
I took off my clothes in 2 seconds.We went to bed. 

419
00:55:59,276 -> 00:56:02,196
I'm touching his shoulder and ... 

420
00:56:02,279 -> 00:56:04,239
I stroke ... ... 

421
00:56:05,282 -> 00:56:06,241
... The hair. 

422
00:56:07,284 -> 00:56:09,203
I ride in it and ... 

423
00:56:14,249 -> 00:56:18,170
Dry ... for me, "Rodney,What are you doing in my bed? " 

424
00:56:19,254 -> 00:56:20,214
What? 

425
00:56:22,257 -> 00:56:24,218
I was surprised. 

426
00:56:25,260 -> 00:56:29,139
On the way to the restaurant,home, undress and all ... 

427
00:56:29,264 -> 00:56:32,226
... And she, no idea who I am. 

428
00:56:35,270 -> 00:56:37,147
- Did you lose your memory?
-Yes. 

429
00:56:37,272 -> 00:56:40,234
He had that disease elderly. 

430
00:56:43,278 -> 00:56:44,154
Alzheimer's. 

431
00:56:44,279 -> 00:56:45,239
Yes, that. 

432
00:56:46,281 -> 00:56:48,242
Man, I recognized all. 

433
00:56:54,289 -> 00:56:56,250
I just would have taken. 

434
00:57:00,295 -> 00:57:01,255
You're funny. 

435
00:58:14,203 -> 00:58:15,204
Hey! 

436
00:58:16,205 -> 00:58:17,206
Hey! 

437
00:58:20,209 -> 00:58:21,210
Do you smoke weed? 

438
00:58:26,215 -> 00:58:27,216
Bueno. 

439
00:59:19,226 -> 00:59:22,187
I told my parents were on vacation ... 

440
00:59:23,230 -> 00:59:25,190
-Aha.
'I lied. 

441
00:59:27,234 -> 00:59:28,193
Have you come from? 

442
00:59:29,236 -> 00:59:30,195
No, do not. 

443
00:59:32,239 -> 00:59:33,198
They are dead. 

444
00:59:36,243 -> 00:59:38,203
Dead? Pillикn. 

445
00:59:41,248 -> 00:59:42,124
Yes. 

446
00:59:42,249 -> 00:59:46,128
Yes Iban rental, plane.I stayed here ... 

447
00:59:46,253 -> 00:59:49,131
... For school. The plane went down. 

448
00:59:49,256 -> 00:59:50,215
What? 

449
00:59:51,258 -> 00:59:52,217
Last month. 

450
00:59:54,261 -> 00:59:56,221
- What are you doing?
I do not know. 

451
01:00:06,273 -> 01:00:07,232
I'll catch you. 

452
01:00:09,276 -> 01:00:10,235
Asshole. 

453
01:00:13,280 -> 01:00:14,239
Asshole. 

454
01:01:14,258 -> 01:01:15,217
Look. 

455
01:01:42,286 -> 01:01:46,248
- Are you okay?
-Yes. That idiot can not dance. 

456
01:01:48,292 -> 01:01:50,252
-I do know.
- Yes? 

457
01:02:01,305 -> 01:02:02,264
Let go. 

458
01:02:11,273 -> 01:02:14,234
- What is it?
-Our engagement ring. 

459
01:02:15,277 -> 01:02:17,154
Now pиоnmelo me. 

460
01:02:17,279 -> 01:02:22,159
Jeffrey, I do not know if I'm ready.Give me a little longer ... 

461
01:02:22,284 -> 01:02:25,162
... To think.
-If you love me ... 

462
01:02:25,287 -> 01:02:27,247
... It's now or never. 

463
01:02:29,291 -> 01:02:30,250
All right. 

464
01:02:38,300 -> 01:02:40,260
I have to get more the request. 

465
01:02:50,312 -> 01:02:51,271
What disgusting. 

466
01:02:53,315 -> 01:02:54,274
Excellent. 

467
01:02:57,319 -> 01:02:58,278
Dame. 

468
01:03:09,248 -> 01:03:10,207
Disgusting. 

469
01:03:23,262 -> 01:03:26,223
- What's so funny?
I do not know. 

470
01:03:33,272 -> 01:03:34,231
Can I have milk? 

471
01:03:42,281 -> 01:03:43,240
Thank you. 

472
01:03:52,291 -> 01:03:55,252
The best damn milk I've tried. 

473
01:04:00,299 -> 01:04:01,175
It is .. 

474
01:04:01,300 -> 01:04:05,262
'It's normal milk.
-Try it. It is very good. 

475
01:04:06,305 -> 01:04:08,223
-Do not make me laugh.
-No. 

476
01:04:08,307 -> 01:04:10,225
So do not smile. 

477
01:04:12,227 -> 01:04:14,146
I'm not doing anything. 

478
01:04:14,229 -> 01:04:16,231
You ...You have to roll over. 

479
01:04:22,237 -> 01:04:23,155
Oh, no. 

480
01:04:23,238 -> 01:04:26,241
I defiled all milk. 

481
01:04:30,245 -> 01:04:32,247
-Sorry.
- Why? Why? 

482
01:04:37,252 -> 01:04:39,171
- What is it?
- What? 

483
01:04:39,254 -> 01:04:41,173
Nothing. Of struggle. 

484
01:04:41,256 -> 01:04:44,259
- Are you good?
-I came to the state finals. 

485
01:04:45,260 -> 01:04:47,262
I bet you bite. 

486
01:04:49,264 -> 01:04:50,265
According ... 

487
01:04:52,267 -> 01:04:53,268
Come on. 

488
01:04:59,274 -> 01:05:03,195
All right. Very good.But that position is fивciI. 

489
01:05:03,278 -> 01:05:04,279
Never mind. 

490
01:05:07,282 -> 01:05:08,283
Come on. 

491
01:05:27,261 -> 01:05:29,221
Say the magic word. 

492
01:05:31,265 -> 01:05:33,225
Say the magic word.That is not. 

493
01:05:34,268 -> 01:05:36,144
- Take off!
-Dila. 

494
01:05:36,270 -> 01:05:38,230
Say the magic word. 

495
01:05:39,273 -> 01:05:40,232
Please. 

496
01:05:47,281 -> 01:05:48,240
You are good. 

497
01:06:19,229 -> 01:06:21,190
Hey, you okay? 

498
01:06:25,235 -> 01:06:27,196
Yes, but as already I'm leaving. 

499
01:06:34,244 -> 01:06:36,205
Hey, my head is spinning. 

500
01:06:39,249 -> 01:06:42,211
I guess I'm not good take. 

501
01:06:44,254 -> 01:06:46,215
You may need to bring refreshments. 

502
01:06:49,259 -> 01:06:50,219
I ... 

503
01:06:51,261 -> 01:06:52,221
I better go. 

504
01:07:00,270 -> 01:07:02,231
Take my wives, Jeffrey. 

505
01:07:08,278 -> 01:07:10,197
-No.
- Where is the key? 

506
01:07:16,245 -> 01:07:20,123
Come on, Jeffrey. I feel like I fall. Take off this shit. 

507
01:07:20,249 -> 01:07:23,210
'I want to go.
'I take them off if you stay. 

508
01:07:27,256 -> 01:07:29,132
All right. Agreed. 

509
01:07:29,258 -> 01:07:31,218
I'm taking on. 

510
01:07:37,266 -> 01:07:39,226
Let me go!Let me go! 

511
01:08:17,222 -> 01:08:21,185
If you had your eyes closed and fall on someone ... 

512
01:08:22,227 -> 01:08:25,189
Do you think you would know ... if boy or girl? 

513
01:08:26,231 -> 01:08:28,192
I do not like guys. 

514
01:08:29,234 -> 01:08:32,154
- How can you be sure?
-Because yes. 

515
01:08:32,237 -> 01:08:35,157
Why experience or only think is wrong? 

516
01:08:35,240 -> 01:08:38,202
Do not say shit. One is thus and now. 

517
01:08:41,246 -> 01:08:43,207
So just to discuss ... 

518
01:08:45,250 -> 01:08:48,170
Not just because you would know he is a man ... 

519
01:08:48,253 -> 01:08:50,214
Excitarикas ... and do not. 

520
01:08:52,257 -> 01:08:55,177
And if it was very dark and could not see ... 

521
01:08:55,260 -> 01:08:56,220
How would you know ...? 

522
01:08:58,263 -> 01:09:01,183
So I think not mind. And when ... 

523
01:09:01,266 -> 01:09:05,229
... I will be in a room Invisible dark type? 

524
01:09:06,271 -> 01:09:09,107
Mind-closed.
- Does having sex with guys is ... 

525
01:09:09,191 -> 01:09:10,192
Open mind ...? 

526
01:09:26,208 -> 01:09:28,210
I think rebel, right? 

527
01:09:29,211 -> 01:09:30,212
No, really. 

528
01:09:35,217 -> 01:09:37,219
OK. What movie do you like? 

529
01:09:39,221 -> 01:09:42,224
- "Bonnie and Clyde".
- Your favorite band? 

530
01:09:43,225 -> 01:09:44,226
"Lynrd Skynrd." 

531
01:09:46,228 -> 01:09:47,229
"The Police"? 

532
01:09:49,231 -> 01:09:50,232
I do not like. 

533
01:09:52,234 -> 01:09:54,987
Bueno. You are obviously a rebel. 

534
01:09:55,070 -> 01:09:57,155
You are against the system. 

535
01:09:57,239 -> 01:10:01,159
'Well, maybe yes.
- Do not you see that having sex ... 

536
01:10:01,243 -> 01:10:05,163
Girls only ... is the most fascist world? 

537
01:10:05,247 -> 01:10:09,168
Clyde Barrow broke every law, including murder. 

538
01:10:09,251 -> 01:10:11,253
-Not caught guys.
-I read it is. 

539
01:10:13,255 -> 01:10:16,258
-There appeared in the film.
'That's shit. 

540
01:10:23,265 -> 01:10:26,268
Do not you see you're being scheduled?

541
01:10:27,269 -> 01:10:30,189
-No.
-You know what will happen.

542
01:10:30,272 -> 01:10:36,236
You marry, you have a job boring, and without realizing it ...

543
01:10:37,279 -> 01:10:39,281
Panzota ... will have a.

544
01:10:41,283 -> 01:10:43,285
You start to hate your wife ...

545
01:10:44,286 -> 01:10:46,288
... And she starts to hate you.

546
01:10:48,290 -> 01:10:51,293
You'll reach a point where you be depressed.

547
01:10:54,296 -> 01:10:57,299
You do not want sex no. Or yourself.

548
01:11:00,302 -> 01:11:03,222
-Seriously.
'That's not going to happen.

549
01:11:03,305 -> 01:11:04,306
We'll see.

550
01:11:19,279 -> 01:11:20,239
I better go.

551
01:11:22,282 -> 01:11:25,244
'You have to go.
'I think so.

552
01:11:28,288 -> 01:11:31,250
- Will you give me a ride?
-No, I'm very tired.

553
01:11:32,292 -> 01:11:34,169
Well, then walk.

554
01:11:34,294 -> 01:11:38,173
You can stay a while.All is well here.

555
01:11:38,298 -> 01:11:40,259
No thanks.

556
01:11:59,319 -> 01:12:02,281
- What the fuck are you doing?
'I'm playing.

557
01:12:04,324 -> 01:12:07,286
It seems that we playing, does it?

558
01:15:33,242 -> 01:15:34,243
Yes you are.

559
01:15:42,251 -> 01:15:43,252
A return now?

560
01:15:44,253 -> 01:15:45,254
Yes good.

561
01:15:47,256 -> 01:15:52,219
I went to the bus stop, but I saw that it was already closed.

562
01:15:53,262 -> 01:15:54,263
Too bad.

563
01:15:56,265 -> 01:15:58,267
Can I ask a taxi?

564
01:15:59,268 -> 01:16:01,270
I do not want to.

565
01:16:02,271 -> 01:16:05,274
- Why? You owe me.
-I owe you shit.

566
01:16:11,238 -> 01:16:13,198
If you want to stay here.

567
01:16:30,257 -> 01:16:32,217
Take off these damn wives.

568
01:17:27,231 -> 01:17:28,190
Are you evil?

569
01:17:31,235 -> 01:17:34,196
No. I vomited and I already I feel better.

570
01:17:41,245 -> 01:17:43,205
Do not I clavarивs a knife, eh?

571
01:17:44,248 -> 01:17:48,168
What? And you did not go to push against the chair?

572
01:17:48,252 -> 01:17:51,171
'You're a screamer.
- What did you expect?

573
01:17:51,255 -> 01:17:55,175
You can not go through life thus pushing people, Jeff.

574
01:17:55,259 -> 01:17:58,178
-I was just playing.
- Playing?

575
01:17:58,262 -> 01:18:01,223
What you call that play?I do not.

576
01:18:04,268 -> 01:18:06,228
Have you ever hurt someone?

577
01:18:07,271 -> 01:18:09,189
No. I have not done.

578
01:18:11,233 -> 01:18:12,192
Never?

579
01:18:16,238 -> 01:18:21,118
Well maybe they stuck to my siblings as a child.

580
01:18:21,243 -> 01:18:25,163
Ever wanted to kill them? Do your parents maybe?

581
01:18:26,248 -> 01:18:27,207
Of course not.

582
01:18:34,256 -> 01:18:36,133
You must have rabies inside.

583
01:18:36,258 -> 01:18:38,218
I have no anger, right?

584
01:18:39,261 -> 01:18:41,138
I think so. I think ...

585
01:18:41,263 -> 01:18:44,224
Act sweet ... innocently ...

586
01:18:45,267 -> 01:18:46,143
To cover ... ...

587
01:18:46,268 -> 01:18:48,145
Intent to kill ... your people.

588
01:18:48,270 -> 01:18:52,191
-Are you saying pure bullshit.
- Oh, really?

589
01:18:55,277 -> 01:18:59,156
Well I'm not an expert in sweet, but I'm not ...

590
01:18:59,281 -> 01:19:03,202
Around thinking ... how do mincemeat of my parents.

591
01:19:04,286 -> 01:19:06,246
- Have you seen?
- See what?

592
01:19:07,289 -> 01:19:11,084
I did not say make mince.I only kill.

593
01:19:11,210 -> 01:19:16,089
But I told you I do not want make hash. So what?

594
01:19:16,215 -> 01:19:19,092
Surely you thought exactly that because ...

595
01:19:19,218 -> 01:19:21,094
I never ... said.
'Nonsense.

596
01:19:21,220 -> 01:19:24,181
Surely you love me make mincemeat now.

597
01:19:25,224 -> 01:19:26,183
Come on, Jeffrey.

598
01:21:07,326 -> 01:21:09,203
Go back to kill me I know.

599
01:21:10,245 -> 01:21:11,246
All right.

600
01:21:14,249 -> 01:21:16,251
Because you want revenge attacked.

601
01:21:18,253 -> 01:21:20,255
You are angry.

602
01:21:22,257 -> 01:21:24,259
Angry at everyone for being gay.

603
01:21:26,261 -> 01:21:27,262
All ...

604
01:21:30,265 -> 01:21:31,266
... They laugh at you.

605
01:21:32,267 -> 01:21:33,268
Shit on you.

606
01:21:36,271 -> 01:21:39,274
And you're black, which is worse.

607
01:21:41,276 -> 01:21:43,278
And the worst of the worst.

608
01:21:46,281 -> 01:21:48,283
You walk like a clown ...

609
01:21:49,284 -> 01:21:51,286
... To be liked by everyone.

610
01:21:54,289 -> 01:21:56,291
But nobody likes you.

611
01:22:00,295 -> 01:22:05,259
But beneath the facade of Rodney sweet and innocent ...

612
01:22:07,302 -> 01:22:12,224
... No more than a disgusting vengeful murderer and thief.

613
01:22:24,278 -> 01:22:25,237
I came back here ...

614
01:22:27,281 -> 01:22:29,241
Because I thought ...I liked you.

615
01:22:42,296 -> 01:22:43,255
You are beautiful.

616
01:22:45,299 -> 01:22:47,259
You have beautiful eyes.

617
01:22:49,303 -> 01:22:50,262
You're high ...

618
01:22:51,305 -> 01:22:52,264
And strong ... ...

619
01:23:01,315 -> 01:23:02,274
GentiI ... but.

620
01:23:08,322 -> 01:23:10,199
I always dreamed of someone ...

621
01:23:11,241 -> 01:23:12,201
Well ... right.

622
01:23:16,246 -> 01:23:18,207
I know it sounds silly but ...

623
01:23:20,250 -> 01:23:21,210
... Is the truth.

624
01:24:46,295 -> 01:24:48,172
- How are you?
-Well.

625
01:24:48,297 -> 01:24:52,176
I saw that viraste a bit.
-Yes. I was just adjusting ...

626
01:24:52,301 -> 01:24:55,179
My mirror because ...their lights blinded me.

627
01:24:55,304 -> 01:24:57,264
I can see your license?

628
01:25:06,315 -> 01:25:09,109
- Is your car, Jeffrey?
-No, sir. From my mom.

629
01:25:09,234 -> 01:25:12,112
It's late. Does your mom you bring your car?

630
01:25:12,237 -> 01:25:15,115
No, it was weekend but let me use it.

631
01:25:15,240 -> 01:25:17,201
And you know you've had?

632
01:25:19,244 -> 01:25:22,122
No, sir, it was just a beer.

633
01:25:22,247 -> 01:25:26,126
- What's in those bags?
-The grass in the garden.

634
01:25:26,251 -> 01:25:29,129
I actually went to the dump right now.

635
01:25:29,254 -> 01:25:32,132
Good time to go there, Jeffrey.

636
01:25:32,257 -> 01:25:36,136
I have not slept well and I thought, you know, it could ...

637
01:25:36,261 -> 01:25:39,223
Doing things ... and so I tired and could sleep.

638
01:25:42,267 -> 01:25:45,145
OK, but come back to your house and you go ...

639
01:25:45,270 -> 01:25:48,232
... To bed. Will you?
'Yes, sir.

640
01:25:49,274 -> 01:25:52,236
-Have a good night.
-Also.

641
01:27:25,245 -> 01:27:26,205
Do you?

642
01:27:30,250 -> 01:27:31,210
What about me?

643
01:27:35,255 -> 01:27:39,218
Why not tell me the right? What do you feel about me?

644
01:27:41,261 -> 01:27:42,221
I told you.

645
01:27:43,263 -> 01:27:47,226
No, not true.Tell me the truth.

646
01:27:49,269 -> 01:27:51,230
I'm a pervert ...

647
01:27:52,272 -> 01:27:54,233
An exhibitionist ... ...

648
01:27:56,276 -> 01:27:57,236
I masturbate ... ...

649
01:28:02,282 -> 01:28:04,243
... And I'm a murderer,like you.

650
01:28:06,286 -> 01:28:09,122
You see? It can be neither a disingenuous.

651
01:28:09,206 -> 01:28:10,165
You talk shit.

652
01:28:15,212 -> 01:28:16,171
It's true.

653
01:28:17,214 -> 01:28:21,176
Not true. I asked you what thought of me.

654
01:28:22,219 -> 01:28:23,136
I told you.

655
01:28:23,220 -> 01:28:29,142
Lie. You said what you thought from me. But you said ...

656
01:28:29,226 -> 01:28:34,147
... "Rodney, I like you." O,"Rodney, you attract me a lot."

657
01:28:34,231 -> 01:28:36,191
That's not what you said.

658
01:28:39,236 -> 01:28:40,195
I do not like.

659
01:28:47,244 -> 01:28:48,203
I think so.

660
01:28:55,252 -> 01:28:56,211
Yes ..

661
01:28:58,255 -> 01:29:00,215

... Or not?

673
01:30:10,285 -> 01:30:11,245
Do not desire.

674
01:30:14,289 -> 01:30:15,249
Oh, yes.

675
01:30:17,292 -> 01:30:18,252
Do not think so.

676
01:30:39,314 -> 01:30:40,274
Wait ...

677
01:30:45,320 -> 01:30:46,280

Are you okay?

682

What about your mother?

683
01:33:17,264 -> 01:33:18,223
They left.

684
01:33:19,266 -> 01:33:20,225

685
01:33:23,270 -> 01:33:26,231

686
