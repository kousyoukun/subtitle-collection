1
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,545
"It's that time Christmas time is here

2
00:00:25,586 --> 00:00:30,215
"Everybody knows There's not a better time of year

3
00:00:31,225 --> 00:00:33,216
"Hear that sleigh."

4
00:00:53,849 --> 00:00:58,513
"Gonna make this holiday As perfect as can be

5
00:00:59,422 --> 00:01:02,755
"Just wait and see This Christmas vacation.

6
00:01:05,194 --> 00:01:09,859
"This old house Sure is looking good

7
00:01:10,767 --> 00:01:15,262
"Got ourselves the finest snowman In the neighborhood.

8
00:01:16,773 --> 00:01:18,207
"Ain't it fun?

9
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:23,203
"Always on the run That's how it's done

10
00:01:23,447 --> 00:01:25,779
"On Christmas vacation.

11
00:01:27,651 --> 00:01:29,447
"Let's all deck the halls

12
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,552
"And light the lights

13
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:34,952
"Get a toasty fire

14
00:01:35,393 --> 00:01:37,224
"Burning bright.

15
00:01:38,896 --> 00:01:40,659
"Give Saint Nick

16
00:01:40,898 --> 00:01:43,799
"The warmest welcome That he's ever had

17
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:47,971
"We're so glad it's Christmas vacation.

18
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:52,237
"And when the nights

19
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:55,178
"Are peaceful and serene

20
00:01:56,816 --> 00:02:01,481
"We can cuddle up And do our Christmas dreamin'.

21
00:02:04,423 --> 00:02:06,221
"Peace and joy and love

22
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,124
"Are everywhere

23
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:12,761
"You can feel the magic in the air.

24
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:19,903
"Let the spirit of the season Carry us away

25
00:02:21,676 --> 00:02:24,337
"Hip, hip, hooray For Christmas vacation."

26
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:16,322
That was beautiful, honey.

27
00:03:30,983 --> 00:03:32,074
Take it, Russ.

28
00:03:35,254 --> 00:03:37,780
Dad, can you explain again what we're doing?

29
00:03:38,223 --> 00:03:41,590
We're kicking off our fun, old-fashioned family Christmas...

30
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,125
...by heading out to the country in the front-wheel drive sleigh...

31
00:03:45,197 --> 00:03:48,258
...to embrace the frosty majesty of the winter landscape...

32
00:03:48,601 --> 00:03:51,435
...and select that most important of Christmas symbols.

33
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:55,232
We're not driving way out here so you can get one of those stupid ties...

34
00:03:55,308 --> 00:03:57,538
...with the Santa Clauses on it, are we, Dad?

35
00:03:57,844 --> 00:03:59,745
No, I have one of those at home.

36
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,944
What we're looking for today is the Griswold family Christmas tree.

37
00:04:14,228 --> 00:04:16,821
- What's the matter? - Some jackass is riding my tail.

38
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:22,035
Slow down and let him pass.

39
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,074
Don't provoke them.

40
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:39,648
Hey, kids. Look, a deer!

41
00:04:59,643 --> 00:05:02,009
Clark! Slow down!

42
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:05,204
You want to ride behind somebody like that?

43
00:05:05,482 --> 00:05:09,180
I'm going to pull around them... burn some dust, here.

44
00:05:09,721 --> 00:05:11,086
Eat my rubber.

45
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:15,691
Dad, I think what you mean is, "Burn rubber" and "Eat my dust."

46
00:05:15,994 --> 00:05:17,018
Whatever, Russ.

47
00:05:22,568 --> 00:05:24,695
Eat my road grit, liver lips!

48
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,274
That's enough of that.

49
00:05:35,781 --> 00:05:38,580
Speaking of Christmas trees, can one of you tell me...

50
00:05:38,651 --> 00:05:41,678
...what the first kind of tree displayed at the White House was?

51
00:05:41,755 --> 00:05:42,744
They're back.

52
00:05:48,161 --> 00:05:51,062
Stop it! I don't want to spend the holidays dead.

53
00:05:51,931 --> 00:05:54,457
Honey, please. I'll do the driving, okay?

54
00:05:55,069 --> 00:05:56,592
Will you just take it easy?

55
00:05:56,971 --> 00:05:58,734
I'm in complete control.

56
00:06:00,241 --> 00:06:02,072
I'll get around this egg timer.

57
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,838
Uh... Dad?!

58
00:06:18,693 --> 00:06:20,661
We're all right! Thank God!

59
00:06:20,861 --> 00:06:23,022
Clark, we're stuck under a truck!

60
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,097
Do you honestly think I don't know that?!

61
00:06:25,168 --> 00:06:26,999
Come on, you guys. Don't fight.

62
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:29,468
For Christ's sake, I didn't do this on purpose.

63
00:06:32,775 --> 00:06:34,970
Our Father, who art in heaven...

64
00:06:35,278 --> 00:06:38,713
...hallowed be Thy name. And forgive my husband.

65
00:06:39,048 --> 00:06:41,779
- He knows not what he does. - Amen!

66
00:06:59,904 --> 00:07:01,632
We made pretty good time.

67
00:07:08,612 --> 00:07:11,480
Dad, didn't they invent Christmas tree lots...

68
00:07:11,584 --> 00:07:15,714
...so people don't have to drive way out to nowhere and waste a Saturday?

69
00:07:16,155 --> 00:07:17,053
They invented 'em...

70
00:07:17,123 --> 00:07:20,558
...because people forgot how to have a fun, old-fashioned family Christmas.

71
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:24,756
They're satisfied with scrawny, dead, overpriced trees with no special meaning.

72
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:25,761
My toes are numb.

73
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,857
This is what our forefathers did.

74
00:07:28,067 --> 00:07:29,933
I can't feel my leg.

75
00:07:30,103 --> 00:07:32,536
They walked out into the woods, picked out that special tree...

76
00:07:32,606 --> 00:07:34,038
...and they cut it down with their bare hands.

77
00:07:34,106 --> 00:07:36,006
Mom, I can't feel my hips.

78
00:07:36,575 --> 00:07:37,599
- Clark? - Yes, honey?

79
00:07:37,744 --> 00:07:40,177
Audrey's frozen from the waist down.

80
00:07:40,247 --> 00:07:42,375
That's all part of the experience, honey.

81
00:07:44,584 --> 00:07:45,448
There it is.

82
00:08:04,772 --> 00:08:06,798
The Griswold family Christmas tree.

83
00:08:13,382 --> 00:08:14,815
Isn't it a little big?

84
00:08:15,484 --> 00:08:17,816
It's not big, it's just full.

85
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,581
That thing wouldn't fit in our yard.

86
00:08:21,557 --> 00:08:25,084
It's not going in our yard, Russ. It's going in our living room.

87
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,727
- Look at it. - It really is beautiful, Clark.

88
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,902
- It's something else, huh, Russ? - Yeah, Dad.

89
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:37,334
Isn't it a beaut, Audrey?

90
00:08:37,473 --> 00:08:38,964
She'll see it later, honey.

91
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,604
Her eyes are frozen.

92
00:08:41,644 --> 00:08:44,512
The most enduring traditions of the season are best enjoyed in...

93
00:08:44,581 --> 00:08:47,278
...the warm embrace of kith and kin.

94
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:52,280
This tree is a symbol of the spirit of the Griswold family Christmas.

95
00:08:54,758 --> 00:08:56,282
Did you bring a saw?

96
00:09:41,376 --> 00:09:45,140
Looks like the toad overestimated the height of his ceiling.

97
00:09:56,823 --> 00:09:57,950
Hey, Griswold!

98
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,694
Where will you put a tree that big?

99
00:10:02,531 --> 00:10:04,260
Bend over and I'll show you.

100
00:10:05,534 --> 00:10:07,833
You got a lot of nerve talking to me like that.

101
00:10:07,936 --> 00:10:09,630
I wasn't talking to you.

102
00:10:26,756 --> 00:10:29,224
Do you think there's enough room for the angel?

103
00:10:29,492 --> 00:10:33,691
Sure, honey. I have a little more trimming to do, but that won't be a problem.

104
00:10:33,963 --> 00:10:34,793
Ready?

105
00:10:35,465 --> 00:10:38,366
I give you the Griswold family Christmas tree.

106
00:10:46,643 --> 00:10:48,544
There's a lot of sap in here.

107
00:10:50,882 --> 00:10:53,350
It looks great. A little full. A lot of sap.

108
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,072
Did I tell you I talked to my mother today?

109
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:22,242
They've decided they're coming for Christmas, too.

110
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,873
It's not too late to change our plans...

111
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:26,543
No, no, that's great.

112
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:30,948
I think you're forgetting how difficult it's gonna be...

113
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,458
...having everybody in the house at the same time.

114
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:36,288
They're family, not strangers off the street.

115
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:38,190
All they do is argue.

116
00:11:39,434 --> 00:11:41,402
Christmas is about resolving differences...

117
00:11:41,468 --> 00:11:44,233
...and seeing through the petty problems of family life.

118
00:11:44,305 --> 00:11:48,298
And it's about my mother accusing your mother of buying cheap hot dogs.

119
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:52,970
And your mother accusing my mother of waxing her upper lip, and...

120
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,842
...then they don't speak to... - Your mother waxes her upper lip?

121
00:11:55,918 --> 00:11:57,579
She has for years.

122
00:11:58,053 --> 00:11:59,418
It doesn't show.

123
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:03,448
I don't know, Sparky, I just have this feeling it's not...

124
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:05,825
I want to have Christmas here, in our house.

125
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,692
It means a lot to me.

126
00:12:08,064 --> 00:12:11,226
All my life I've wanted to have a big family Christmas.

127
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:18,329
It's just that you build things up in your mind, Sparky.

128
00:12:19,976 --> 00:12:23,639
You set standards no family event can ever live up to.

129
00:12:24,948 --> 00:12:26,438
When have I ever done that?

130
00:12:30,121 --> 00:12:31,145
Parties.

131
00:12:32,256 --> 00:12:33,348
Weddings.

132
00:12:34,292 --> 00:12:36,123
- Good night, honey. - Anniversaries.

133
00:12:36,761 --> 00:12:37,853
Funerals.

134
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,354
Holidays.

135
00:12:40,665 --> 00:12:41,996
Vacations.

136
00:12:42,366 --> 00:12:43,663
Graduations.

137
00:13:06,592 --> 00:13:09,824
Guess you'll be lookin' at a nice fat Christmas bonus this year, huh?

138
00:13:09,897 --> 00:13:11,726
Word is you're an excellent choice to be named...

139
00:13:11,798 --> 00:13:13,595
...Food Additive Designer of the Year.

140
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,861
- Nah... - I'm not kidding.

141
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:18,669
What's that new thing you got over there at Food 'N' Dry?

142
00:13:18,738 --> 00:13:22,470
The crunch enhancer? That's a non-nutritive cereal varnish.

143
00:13:22,542 --> 00:13:24,134
It's semi-permeable. It's not osmotic.

144
00:13:24,211 --> 00:13:25,940
What it does is, it coats and seals the flake.

145
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,412
It prevents the milk from penetrating it.

146
00:13:27,481 --> 00:13:29,745
Yeah, it's a beautiful product.

147
00:13:29,951 --> 00:13:30,678
I like it.

148
00:13:30,784 --> 00:13:33,253
What are you gonna do with that big bonus check?

149
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,685
You're gonna blow it on yourself, I hope.

150
00:13:34,756 --> 00:13:36,052
Me? Heck, no.

151
00:13:37,091 --> 00:13:38,582
Take a look at this.

152
00:13:43,498 --> 00:13:45,728
I just hope my Christmas bonus check will cover it.

153
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,462
Oh, my God. You're putting in a pool.

154
00:13:58,315 --> 00:14:01,613
I went ahead and I put a $7,500 deposit down on it.

155
00:14:01,851 --> 00:14:03,876
You're the last true family man.

156
00:14:05,688 --> 00:14:06,416
Mark.

157
00:14:07,591 --> 00:14:08,523
Clark.

158
00:14:10,428 --> 00:14:11,417
That's Bill, sir.

159
00:14:11,828 --> 00:14:15,025
Are you the one who's working on that non-nutritive cereal varnish?

160
00:14:15,098 --> 00:14:15,962
Yes, sir.

161
00:14:16,132 --> 00:14:19,365
I've got to give a speech to a trade group. I'd like to mention it.

162
00:14:19,436 --> 00:14:22,600
Write up a brief summary and have it to me by the end of the day.

163
00:14:22,673 --> 00:14:23,697
My pleasure.

164
00:14:23,941 --> 00:14:28,106
Layman's terms. None of that inside, bullshit jargon that nobody understands.

165
00:14:28,545 --> 00:14:29,774
Yes, sir.

166
00:14:33,085 --> 00:14:34,643
Oh, Mr. Shirley...

167
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,953
We got your Christmas card the other day, and...

168
00:14:37,021 --> 00:14:40,287
...my family and I are very flattered that you remembered us.

169
00:14:40,893 --> 00:14:42,019
Corporate cards.

170
00:14:46,599 --> 00:14:48,157
Don't forget that report, Bill.

171
00:14:48,232 --> 00:14:49,757
Yes, sir. Merry Christmas.

172
00:14:51,971 --> 00:14:55,566
Merry Christmas. Kiss my ass. Kiss his ass. Kiss your ass.

173
00:14:55,942 --> 00:14:57,170
Happy Hanukkah.

174
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,033
Can I show you something?

175
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,842
I was just smelling... smiling.

176
00:15:36,152 --> 00:15:37,640
I was blouse... browsing.

177
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:40,910
For your wife or girlfriend?

178
00:15:42,925 --> 00:15:44,688
What? What happened?

179
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:53,233
I guess it wouldn't be any...

180
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,227
It wouldn't be the Christmas shopping season...

181
00:15:56,305 --> 00:15:59,901
...if the stores were any less hooter than they... Hotter than they are.

182
00:16:00,944 --> 00:16:02,103
It is warm in here.

183
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,372
- When you have your coat on. - Do I?

184
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:06,742
- How did that happen? - Because it's cold out.

185
00:16:06,817 --> 00:16:08,909
Yes. Yes.

186
00:16:08,986 --> 00:16:11,819
It is. It's a bit nipply out. I mean, nippy out.

187
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:14,119
What am I saying? Nipple?

188
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,119
There is a nip in the air, though.

189
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:19,321
Can I take something out for you?

190
00:16:28,473 --> 00:16:30,168
I was just, uh...

191
00:16:31,077 --> 00:16:33,476
I was looking at something for my wife.

192
00:16:33,746 --> 00:16:35,145
God rest her soul.

193
00:16:35,347 --> 00:16:36,939
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

194
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:40,415
Oh, no, no, she's not dead, yet. We're just divorced.

195
00:16:41,187 --> 00:16:42,484
She's history.

196
00:16:42,555 --> 00:16:44,352
Obviously, she doesn't wear underwear...

197
00:16:44,424 --> 00:16:48,793
...there are plenty of shopping days left until adultery... adulthood.

198
00:16:48,929 --> 00:16:52,365
Which is to say, Christmas, as in Yule. Yule log.

199
00:16:52,699 --> 00:16:55,690
Not a log. I don't have a log, but I mean, you know...

200
00:16:55,768 --> 00:16:59,068
...if I had a log. Not in the sense you think I said I did.

201
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,000
Good golly.

202
00:17:02,943 --> 00:17:04,775
'Tis the season to be merry.

203
00:17:05,011 --> 00:17:06,239
Well, that's my name.

204
00:17:06,313 --> 00:17:07,473
No shit.

205
00:17:23,531 --> 00:17:25,727
These are cut really high on the hip.

206
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,361
Look, I'm wearing something similar. See? You can't see the line.

207
00:17:29,537 --> 00:17:32,565
- You can't see the line, can you, Russ? - No.

208
00:17:39,915 --> 00:17:44,079
Look, Daddy, teacher says every time a bell rings...

209
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,481
...an angel gets his wings.

210
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:21,387
Folks!

211
00:18:22,027 --> 00:18:23,188
Merry Christmas.

212
00:18:33,439 --> 00:18:35,270
Look how big you've gotten.

213
00:18:35,709 --> 00:18:37,369
Merry Christmas.

214
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:39,040
Mom.

215
00:18:39,545 --> 00:18:41,035
Knock on the door.

216
00:18:44,317 --> 00:18:45,909
Doesn't Nora look old?

217
00:18:46,052 --> 00:18:47,542
You promised, you promised...

218
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,749
They took a pint of fluid out of my lower back.

219
00:18:49,823 --> 00:18:53,156
You see this mole? This mole on my neck? You think it's changing color?

220
00:18:53,227 --> 00:18:55,660
No. You keep touching it. It's getting redder.

221
00:18:55,729 --> 00:18:57,094
I got hemorrhoids.

222
00:18:57,264 --> 00:18:58,162
Could you believe that?

223
00:18:58,232 --> 00:19:00,029
- Oh, Mother. - Isn't that terrible?

224
00:19:00,235 --> 00:19:02,760
- You're not getting the space... - After what you did to my car?

225
00:19:02,837 --> 00:19:04,998
I'm doing the parking. Come and help me with the...

226
00:19:05,073 --> 00:19:08,201
Mom, they're not sleeping in my room. I'm gonna go crazy...

227
00:19:08,276 --> 00:19:11,678
Sweetheart, your grandma Nora's got a real painful burr on her heel.

228
00:19:11,746 --> 00:19:14,146
If you rub it for me, I'll give you a quarter.

229
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,082
- A quarter. - And I'll give Audrey a quarter, too.

230
00:19:17,151 --> 00:19:19,780
I'm going to put my car in the garage!

231
00:19:19,855 --> 00:19:21,755
I'll park the cars.

232
00:19:23,158 --> 00:19:25,524
This is what Christmas is all about.

233
00:19:26,329 --> 00:19:30,320
I'll park the cars and check the luggage, and...

234
00:19:30,766 --> 00:19:33,098
I'll be outside for the season.

235
00:19:36,773 --> 00:19:39,298
We'll have the best-looking house in town.

236
00:19:39,377 --> 00:19:41,206
I've always wanted to do this.

237
00:19:41,278 --> 00:19:43,007
That's a lot of lights, Dad.

238
00:19:43,078 --> 00:19:46,013
I'm sure it's a lot of work, but if I'm out in the cold...

239
00:19:46,082 --> 00:19:48,312
...and I'm committed to decorating the house...

240
00:19:48,385 --> 00:19:51,220
...l'm gonna do it right and I'm gonna do it big.

241
00:19:52,123 --> 00:19:54,819
You want something you can be proud of, don't you?

242
00:19:54,891 --> 00:19:56,291
Yeah, I guess so.

243
00:19:56,627 --> 00:19:58,288
Sure you do.

244
00:19:58,696 --> 00:20:01,130
You think you might be overdoing it, Dad?

245
00:20:01,198 --> 00:20:04,565
Russ, when was the last time I overdid anything?

246
00:20:07,705 --> 00:20:09,697
Come on, unravel these.

247
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:12,841
You have to check every bulb.

248
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:15,573
A little knot here. You work on that.

249
00:20:17,481 --> 00:20:19,506
I'll get the other box.

250
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:34,357
I hope he falls and breaks his neck.

251
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:39,065
I'm sure he'll fall. But I don't think we're lucky enough to have him break his neck.

252
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:42,839
Let's go.

253
00:21:10,205 --> 00:21:15,041
These gusty winds appear to be playing havoc with the giant nutcracker float.

254
00:21:15,276 --> 00:21:19,235
At this point, I can't even see the nuts. They must have blown away.

255
00:21:19,647 --> 00:21:23,914
But nothing is going to dampen the spirit of this holiday crowd, I can tell you that.

256
00:21:23,987 --> 00:21:26,478
Oh, here they are. Here come the nuts.

257
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:47,337
Would it be indecent to ask the grandparents to stay at a hotel?

258
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,375
Can we at least forbid them to answer the phone?

259
00:22:51,445 --> 00:22:54,209
Alexander called this morning and Grandpa Clark told him...

260
00:22:54,281 --> 00:22:57,513
...I couldn't come to the phone 'cause I was going to the bathroom.

261
00:22:57,586 --> 00:22:59,747
We're all making sacrifices, Audrey.

262
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:00,986
Everybody?

263
00:23:01,056 --> 00:23:05,084
Do you sleep with your brother? Do you know how sick and twisted that is?

264
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,324
I'm sleeping with your father. Don't be so dramatic.

265
00:23:09,898 --> 00:23:14,269
I have nightmares about what he does in bed alone when I'm not lying next to him.

266
00:23:14,504 --> 00:23:17,838
I don't know what to say except it's Christmas...

267
00:23:18,274 --> 00:23:20,105
...and we're all in misery.

268
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:23,570
Ellen, are you smoking again?

269
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,913
No!

270
00:23:37,162 --> 00:23:39,629
Dad, where do you want these reindeer?

271
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:42,125
Just put them on the lawn, Russ.

272
00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:46,269
I can't find the Santa Claus.

273
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:50,440
It's in the basement. We'll get it later.

274
00:24:46,435 --> 00:24:48,767
Clark? Dinner's ready.

275
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:52,001
Okay, honey. I'm starving.

276
00:25:11,126 --> 00:25:15,496
Obviously something broke the window. Something hit the stereo.

277
00:25:25,242 --> 00:25:27,904
And why is the carpet all wet, Todd?

278
00:25:28,044 --> 00:25:30,411
I don't know, Margo.

279
00:25:38,323 --> 00:25:41,486
You wanna hurry this up, Clark? I'm freezing my baguettes off.

280
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:45,858
Two hundred and fifty strands of lights, 100 individual bulbs per strand...

281
00:25:46,264 --> 00:25:49,860
...for a grand total of 25,000 imported Italian twinkle lights.

282
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,431
Twenty-five thousand.

283
00:25:53,571 --> 00:25:55,767
I hope nobody I know drives by...

284
00:25:55,941 --> 00:25:59,569
...and sees me standing in the yard, staring at my house in my pajamas.

285
00:25:59,645 --> 00:26:02,773
If they know your dad, they won't think anything of it.

286
00:26:02,849 --> 00:26:04,338
Fire it up!

287
00:26:05,585 --> 00:26:09,782
I dedicate this house to the Griswold family Christmas.

288
00:26:12,992 --> 00:26:14,358
Drum roll, please.

289
00:26:16,997 --> 00:26:18,022
Drum roll.

290
00:26:32,813 --> 00:26:36,477
"Joy to the world."

291
00:26:50,833 --> 00:26:52,267
Beautiful, Clark.

292
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:55,396
Talk about pissing your money away.

293
00:26:56,239 --> 00:27:00,641
I hope you kids see what a silly waste of resources this was.

294
00:27:00,909 --> 00:27:02,900
He worked really hard, Grandma.

295
00:27:03,146 --> 00:27:04,909
So do washing machines.

296
00:27:09,853 --> 00:27:11,753
Let's get in where it's warm.

297
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:17,086
Clark, baby, I can picture it in my mind and it's breathtaking.

298
00:27:20,564 --> 00:27:21,724
Thanks, Mom.

299
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:27,461
It's probably a bad bulb. You know, if one goes out, the whole thing won't work.

300
00:27:27,705 --> 00:27:30,869
If I were you, I'd personally check each one.

301
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:32,440
I did that, Dad.

302
00:27:32,676 --> 00:27:36,545
If you need any help, give me a holler. I'll be upstairs asleep.

303
00:27:38,617 --> 00:27:42,952
I'm sorry, Daddy. It looks good, even if they're not lit.

304
00:27:44,557 --> 00:27:46,148
Thank you, sweetheart.

305
00:27:52,632 --> 00:27:55,294
Well, Dad, it was a good try.

306
00:27:55,635 --> 00:27:56,967
Thanks, Russ.

307
00:27:59,639 --> 00:28:02,005
We checked every bulb, didn't we?

308
00:28:03,709 --> 00:28:05,905
I'm sure of it.

309
00:28:09,016 --> 00:28:11,007
Maybe we ought to go up there and just...

310
00:28:11,084 --> 00:28:12,813
Geez! Look at the time.

311
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,210
I have to go to bed.

312
00:28:15,722 --> 00:28:17,622
Brush my teeth, feed the hog.

313
00:28:17,724 --> 00:28:21,957
I still got some homework to do, do the laundry, wash the car...

314
00:28:27,936 --> 00:28:29,995
Don't stay up too late.

315
00:28:51,527 --> 00:28:53,894
Get off me, you little fungus.

316
00:30:55,091 --> 00:30:57,584
Where the hell is that cold coming from?

317
00:31:20,618 --> 00:31:23,611
- I need just a few more... - Pay by check, if you can.

318
00:31:24,121 --> 00:31:27,114
- Not a card? - No, it's a hassle if you have to return.

319
00:31:34,134 --> 00:31:34,963
Help!

320
00:31:35,035 --> 00:31:37,298
Daddy. Is Clark coming?

321
00:31:37,369 --> 00:31:38,631
How the hell would I know?

322
00:31:38,704 --> 00:31:39,671
Is he in the house?

323
00:31:39,738 --> 00:31:42,640
If he's not farting around with the lights, he must be.

324
00:31:42,709 --> 00:31:45,577
I'm sure he wants to come shopping and have lunch with us.

325
00:31:45,646 --> 00:31:50,548
He's got another car. He can drive. I have to eat so I can take my back pill.

326
00:35:52,774 --> 00:35:55,538
I want to take off these clothes, sit with a glass of wine...

327
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:57,544
...and kiss every inch of your body.

328
00:35:57,612 --> 00:36:00,445
- After you shower, of course. - Of course.

329
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:19,233
- Sparky? - Yes, honey.

330
00:36:28,278 --> 00:36:31,736
Are you out here for a reason, or are you just avoiding the family?

331
00:36:32,083 --> 00:36:34,915
I still have a couple hundred more bulbs to check.

332
00:36:35,852 --> 00:36:37,753
Meantime, I can light the Santa...

333
00:36:37,823 --> 00:36:41,087
...and the eight tiny reindeer and the "Merry Christmas" sign.

334
00:36:41,158 --> 00:36:43,649
That should look good. Ready?

335
00:36:43,928 --> 00:36:45,589
Want me to do the drum roll thing?

336
00:36:45,663 --> 00:36:47,757
No, it's okay. Here goes nothing.

337
00:36:55,507 --> 00:36:57,134
I don't understand it.

338
00:36:58,845 --> 00:37:02,076
The house lights don't work, the floodlights don't work.

339
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:05,838
Is it plugged in?

340
00:37:06,184 --> 00:37:09,018
Do you think I would check thousands of tiny lights...

341
00:37:09,088 --> 00:37:12,148
...if I wasn't sure the extension cord was plugged in?

342
00:37:14,027 --> 00:37:16,518
You used more than one cord, didn't you?

343
00:37:18,864 --> 00:37:22,733
Maybe the kids have been fooling around with it. I'll check in the back.

344
00:37:43,658 --> 00:37:44,625
Clark!

345
00:37:47,228 --> 00:37:48,957
- Todd! - Sorry!

346
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,000
Honey, I think I know what's wrong.

347
00:38:10,587 --> 00:38:11,747
I can't see!

348
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:31,839
This ought to do it.

349
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,580
I fixed it!

350
00:38:50,129 --> 00:38:52,963
Everybody! Come out quick! Look at the lights!

351
00:39:02,008 --> 00:39:03,976
- Get a towel. - Okay!

352
00:39:07,714 --> 00:39:09,476
Wait a minute! I don't believe this.

353
00:39:09,549 --> 00:39:11,847
What's all that yelling about?

354
00:39:13,653 --> 00:39:15,246
What's going on here?!

355
00:39:17,324 --> 00:39:19,155
Twenty-five thousand twinkle lights.

356
00:39:20,994 --> 00:39:22,484
What's he doing?

357
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:24,357
I haven't the foggiest.

358
00:39:26,567 --> 00:39:28,160
What the hell?!

359
00:39:28,904 --> 00:39:30,962
What is wrong with this?!

360
00:39:32,673 --> 00:39:34,231
Damn it!

361
00:39:38,914 --> 00:39:40,313
You goddamn thing!

362
00:40:13,216 --> 00:40:14,775
Dad, it's beautiful!

363
00:40:30,735 --> 00:40:32,635
Oh, my carpet!

364
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:44,247
Clark, it's so lovely.

365
00:40:47,586 --> 00:40:50,419
You deserve a home like this to spend Christmas in.

366
00:40:53,593 --> 00:40:56,083
It's a beaut, Clark. A beaut.

367
00:40:58,264 --> 00:41:01,257
You taught me everything I know about exterior illumination.

368
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:03,098
Thank you, thank you.

369
00:41:04,338 --> 00:41:05,737
Russ. Audrey.

370
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:12,442
Dear... Francis.

371
00:41:15,282 --> 00:41:18,117
I hope this adds to your enjoyment of the holidays.

372
00:41:18,453 --> 00:41:20,443
It's just wonderful.

373
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:23,950
Arthur.

374
00:41:24,959 --> 00:41:25,948
Art.

375
00:41:27,629 --> 00:41:28,788
Dad.

376
00:41:29,298 --> 00:41:30,856
Thanks for being here.

377
00:41:31,133 --> 00:41:33,566
The little lights are not twinkling.

378
00:41:33,635 --> 00:41:36,297
I know, Art, and thanks for noticing.

379
00:41:40,809 --> 00:41:43,301
The house sure does look swell, Clark.

380
00:41:43,378 --> 00:41:44,708
Thanks, Eddie.

381
00:41:45,147 --> 00:41:49,312
I hope it enhances your holiday spirit. Dear Catherine.

382
00:41:49,652 --> 00:41:51,279
Eddie?

383
00:41:52,555 --> 00:41:55,047
The house is gorgeous, Clark.

384
00:41:56,158 --> 00:41:57,319
Eddie?

385
00:41:57,826 --> 00:42:00,819
I hope you didn't do this all on our account, Clark.

386
00:42:01,164 --> 00:42:04,760
Kids, come on out here and see what Uncle Clark's done to the house.

387
00:42:04,835 --> 00:42:05,894
Eddie?

388
00:42:13,344 --> 00:42:14,311
Eddie?

389
00:42:17,181 --> 00:42:20,174
If you don't remember, this here is Rocky.

390
00:42:21,419 --> 00:42:24,855
- Have you got a kiss for me? - Take a rain check on that, Art.

391
00:42:24,923 --> 00:42:27,756
He's got a lip fungus that ain't identified yet.

392
00:42:30,462 --> 00:42:32,452
You remember Ruby Sue?

393
00:42:34,867 --> 00:42:36,697
Oh, my gosh!

394
00:42:38,537 --> 00:42:40,334
Her eyes are not crossed anymore.

395
00:42:40,406 --> 00:42:41,874
That somethin', ain't it?

396
00:42:41,941 --> 00:42:44,034
She falls in a well, her eyes go cross.

397
00:42:44,111 --> 00:42:47,545
A mule kicks her, they go back to normal. I don't know.

398
00:42:51,218 --> 00:42:53,379
And this here is our pride and joy.

399
00:42:53,453 --> 00:42:54,887
Snots.

400
00:42:55,789 --> 00:42:56,948
Pretty name.

401
00:42:57,056 --> 00:43:00,117
We named him that 'cause he's got this sinus condition.

402
00:43:00,893 --> 00:43:04,227
Snots, you roll over and let Uncle Clark scratch your belly.

403
00:43:06,402 --> 00:43:09,733
You never seen a set on a dog like this one's got, Clark.

404
00:43:10,571 --> 00:43:12,198
That's okay, Eddie.

405
00:43:12,573 --> 00:43:15,235
That's somethin', ain't it? You pet him on the belly...

406
00:43:15,309 --> 00:43:17,504
...and he'll love you till the day you die.

407
00:43:17,578 --> 00:43:20,172
I really shouldn't. My hands are all chapped.

408
00:43:20,749 --> 00:43:25,412
We were going to call, but Eddie wanted to make it a surprise.

409
00:43:25,654 --> 00:43:26,985
You surprised?

410
00:43:27,256 --> 00:43:28,280
Surprised, Eddie?

411
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:30,888
If I woke up tomorrow with my head sewn to the carpet...

412
00:43:31,059 --> 00:43:33,493
...I wouldn't be more surprised than I am right now.

413
00:43:35,764 --> 00:43:37,756
We have plenty of room.

414
00:43:39,936 --> 00:43:43,497
Plenty of towels. Plenty of everything.

415
00:43:45,107 --> 00:43:49,101
We're pretty well set up here in the RV. It's a little tight but...

416
00:43:49,678 --> 00:43:51,203
...we didn't come to impose.

417
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,113
There's plenty of room.

418
00:43:53,551 --> 00:43:55,610
Quit being so damn polite, Ed.

419
00:43:56,421 --> 00:44:01,686
Catherine and I are pretty comfy in there, but maybe you folks wouldn't mind...

420
00:44:01,758 --> 00:44:03,454
...the youngsters shacking up with you.

421
00:44:03,527 --> 00:44:05,358
After that long drive...

422
00:44:05,463 --> 00:44:08,126
...we could use a little private time together.

423
00:44:08,967 --> 00:44:14,233
Honey, why don't you get the kids' things. Don't forget the rubber sheets and gerbils.

424
00:44:14,306 --> 00:44:16,136
I'll show you the home.

425
00:44:54,249 --> 00:44:56,240
That's a honey of a tree, Clark.

426
00:44:57,185 --> 00:44:58,344
Is it real?

427
00:44:59,353 --> 00:45:01,117
I dug it out of the ground myself.

428
00:45:01,188 --> 00:45:02,519
Is that a fact?

429
00:45:03,023 --> 00:45:04,719
Get out of there, Snots!

430
00:45:04,791 --> 00:45:05,780
Don't worry about it.

431
00:45:05,859 --> 00:45:08,384
A little tree water ain't gonna hurt him.

432
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:11,465
Before we left, he drank a half a quart of Pennzoil.

433
00:45:11,533 --> 00:45:14,366
He lifted his leg the next mornin'...

434
00:45:16,739 --> 00:45:19,606
If he drinks the water out of there, the tree's gonna dry up.

435
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:21,370
Come on out of there.

436
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:27,205
Get out of there. Go in the kitchen and get something to eat.

437
00:45:27,951 --> 00:45:29,645
He's cute, ain't he?

438
00:45:29,718 --> 00:45:33,620
Only problem is, he's got a little bit of Mississippi leg hound in him.

439
00:45:33,889 --> 00:45:38,122
If the mood catches him right, he'll grab your leg and just go to town.

440
00:45:39,396 --> 00:45:43,231
You don't want him around if you're wearing short pants.

441
00:45:44,401 --> 00:45:45,892
A word of warning, though.

442
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:49,200
If he does lay into you, it's best to just let him finish.

443
00:45:51,908 --> 00:45:55,503
I can't believe you're actually standing here in my living room, Eddie.

444
00:45:55,781 --> 00:45:57,248
Never thought the day would come.

445
00:45:57,316 --> 00:45:59,146
I'm excited about it, too.

446
00:46:00,251 --> 00:46:03,084
It's a cryin' shame the older kids couldn't make it.

447
00:46:06,825 --> 00:46:09,258
I'll get that. Don't worry about it. It's okay.

448
00:46:13,565 --> 00:46:17,763
I got the daughter in the clinic getting cured off the Wild Turkey.

449
00:46:18,704 --> 00:46:22,505
The older boy, bless his soul, is preparing for his career.

450
00:46:23,108 --> 00:46:24,666
- College? - Carnival.

451
00:46:25,777 --> 00:46:27,040
You gotta be proud.

452
00:46:28,615 --> 00:46:32,813
Last season, he was a pixie dust spreader on the Tilt-O-Whirl.

453
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:36,282
He thinks that maybe next year, he'll be guessing people's weight...

454
00:46:36,355 --> 00:46:38,415
...or barking for the Yak Woman.

455
00:46:39,959 --> 00:46:41,893
- You ever see her? - No.

456
00:46:41,961 --> 00:46:45,295
She got these big horns growing right out above her ears.

457
00:46:45,532 --> 00:46:48,023
She's ugly as sin, but a sweet gal.

458
00:46:48,102 --> 00:46:49,296
And a hell of a good cook.

459
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:52,066
Can I refill your eggnog for you? Get you something to eat?

460
00:46:52,139 --> 00:46:54,631
Drive you out to the middle of nowhere and leave you for dead?

461
00:46:54,708 --> 00:46:56,870
No, I'm doing just fine.

462
00:46:57,444 --> 00:46:58,811
Just glad to be here.

463
00:47:00,482 --> 00:47:03,144
When did you get the tenement on wheels?

464
00:47:03,985 --> 00:47:06,818
Oh, that? That's an RV.

465
00:47:08,289 --> 00:47:09,985
I borrowed it off a buddy of mine.

466
00:47:10,058 --> 00:47:12,891
He took my house, I took the RV.

467
00:47:13,829 --> 00:47:15,820
It's a good-looking vehicle, ain't it?

468
00:47:16,499 --> 00:47:18,433
It looks so nice parked in the driveway.

469
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:21,834
It sure does. Don't you go falling in love with it.

470
00:47:22,571 --> 00:47:25,665
We're taking it with us when we leave here next month.

471
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:38,352
Get Ed Leftic up here to look over these figures!

472
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:41,082
Retooling. That's a great excuse.

473
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,526
Retooling?! I'll retool you!

474
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:50,524
Mr. Shirley, Merry Christmas.

475
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:52,196
Who's that?

476
00:47:53,137 --> 00:47:54,798
It's me, Clark Griswold.

477
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:56,439
What do you want?

478
00:47:57,542 --> 00:48:01,877
My wife and I just came up with a little something special. It's a gift.

479
00:48:02,948 --> 00:48:05,542
Put it over there with the others, Greaseball.

480
00:48:16,229 --> 00:48:20,689
By the way, I hope my report helped out at the trade show.

481
00:48:25,571 --> 00:48:27,562
I'm sure it did, Grisball.

482
00:48:28,308 --> 00:48:31,642
If you'll excuse me, I'm in the middle of an important call.

483
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:33,945
Get me somebody.

484
00:48:34,081 --> 00:48:35,309
Anybody.

485
00:48:37,016 --> 00:48:38,677
And get me somebody while I'm waiting.

486
00:48:51,666 --> 00:48:55,830
This is a new non-caloric, silicon-based kitchen lubricant...

487
00:48:55,937 --> 00:48:57,267
...my company's been working on.

488
00:48:57,339 --> 00:49:01,035
It creates a surface 500 times more slippery than cooking oil.

489
00:49:01,108 --> 00:49:03,543
We'll fly down the hill with this stuff.

490
00:49:03,945 --> 00:49:06,005
Has anyone ever used it on a sled?

491
00:49:06,082 --> 00:49:07,549
Not that I know of.

492
00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:13,110
Don't go puttin' none of that stuff on my sled, Clark.

493
00:49:13,455 --> 00:49:16,789
- You know the metal plate in my head? - How could I forget it.

494
00:49:16,958 --> 00:49:20,794
I had it replaced. Every time Catherine raved up the microwave...

495
00:49:20,931 --> 00:49:23,763
...l'd piss in my pants and forget who I was.

496
00:49:24,134 --> 00:49:27,034
Over at the V.A., they had it replaced with a plastic one.

497
00:49:27,304 --> 00:49:29,295
That ain't as strong, so...

498
00:49:29,806 --> 00:49:31,967
I shouldn't go sailing down a hill...

499
00:49:32,041 --> 00:49:34,307
...with nothing between the ground and my brain...

500
00:49:34,379 --> 00:49:36,609
...but a piece of government plastic.

501
00:49:38,148 --> 00:49:39,911
You really think it matters, Eddie?

502
00:49:39,983 --> 00:49:42,816
The plate runs right underneath my part.

503
00:49:44,823 --> 00:49:47,155
Over here is nothing, but...

504
00:49:47,492 --> 00:49:52,327
...if this gets dented, then my hair just ain't going to look right.

505
00:49:54,999 --> 00:49:56,466
I know the feeling.

506
00:49:57,836 --> 00:50:00,305
I better try this first. See how it works.

507
00:50:00,371 --> 00:50:02,202
Be careful there, Clark.

508
00:50:02,273 --> 00:50:04,208
Nothing to worry about, Eddie.

509
00:50:04,343 --> 00:50:08,747
Going for a new, amateur-recreational- saucer-sled land-speed record...

510
00:50:09,182 --> 00:50:11,673
Clark W. Griswold, Junior!

511
00:50:12,352 --> 00:50:15,684
Remember, don't try this at home, kids. I am a professional.

512
00:50:18,858 --> 00:50:20,190
Later, dudes.

513
00:50:21,529 --> 00:50:23,520
Let her rip. Hang ten.

514
00:50:41,249 --> 00:50:42,682
It's great! I'm dead!

515
00:51:28,933 --> 00:51:30,093
Bingo.

516
00:51:43,114 --> 00:51:45,048
- You're staying late? - Hi, Bill.

517
00:51:45,116 --> 00:51:46,447
Yeah. Just...

518
00:51:47,118 --> 00:51:50,610
...finishing up a few things. Last day of the year for me.

519
00:51:51,288 --> 00:51:54,123
Have a really Merry Christmas.

520
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:56,519
You, too.

521
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:00,157
You okay?

522
00:52:01,233 --> 00:52:02,223
Yeah.

523
00:52:03,969 --> 00:52:06,461
Bill, did you get your bonus yet?

524
00:52:06,806 --> 00:52:08,707
Just talked to my son.

525
00:52:09,076 --> 00:52:11,909
Company messenger just brought something to my house.

526
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:14,779
Nothing like waiting till the last minute, huh?

527
00:52:15,983 --> 00:52:17,245
You get yours?

528
00:52:19,319 --> 00:52:22,015
If it isn't at the house, I'm sure it must be on its way.

529
00:52:22,089 --> 00:52:25,924
If I don't get that bonus, I'm in it up to here.

530
00:52:26,327 --> 00:52:28,090
Don't sweat it. It'll come.

531
00:52:28,161 --> 00:52:29,424
Merry Christmas.

532
00:52:29,496 --> 00:52:30,725
Same to you.

533
00:52:50,853 --> 00:52:54,687
"'Mele Kalikimaka' is the thing to say

534
00:52:55,357 --> 00:52:57,349
"On a bright Hawaiian

535
00:52:57,593 --> 00:52:59,255
"Christmas day.

536
00:53:00,363 --> 00:53:02,524
"That's the island greeting

537
00:53:02,699 --> 00:53:05,758
"That we send to you From the land

538
00:53:06,535 --> 00:53:08,868
"Where palm trees sway.

539
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,831
"Here we know that Christmas

540
00:53:12,076 --> 00:53:13,805
"Will be green and bright

541
00:53:14,278 --> 00:53:16,542
"The sun to shine by day

542
00:53:16,713 --> 00:53:18,705
"And all the stars at night.

543
00:53:19,116 --> 00:53:23,280
"'Mele Kalikimaka' is Hawaii's way

544
00:53:23,621 --> 00:53:26,785
"To say 'Merry Christmas' to you."

545
00:54:42,036 --> 00:54:43,368
Santy Claus?

546
00:54:44,474 --> 00:54:46,805
Uncle Clark, are you Santy Claus?

547
00:54:47,077 --> 00:54:47,940
What?

548
00:54:51,815 --> 00:54:53,304
What? You scared me.

549
00:54:55,384 --> 00:54:57,318
No, I'm not Santa Claus.

550
00:55:00,825 --> 00:55:02,053
I wish I was.

551
00:55:04,328 --> 00:55:06,454
What are you doing up, sweetheart?

552
00:55:08,165 --> 00:55:09,826
Rocky bit my thumb.

553
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:13,333
Him's nervous because Christmas is almost here.

554
00:55:14,506 --> 00:55:15,972
Nervous or excited?

555
00:55:16,508 --> 00:55:17,838
Shittin' bricks.

556
00:55:19,176 --> 00:55:20,667
You shouldn't use that word.

557
00:55:20,745 --> 00:55:23,236
Sorry. Shittin' rocks.

558
00:55:26,018 --> 00:55:29,476
Him's nervous because he don't know if he's gettin' nothin'.

559
00:55:32,457 --> 00:55:35,688
I don't think he should be nervous, and you shouldn't be, either.

560
00:55:35,762 --> 00:55:38,594
'Cause if you're good, Santa knows it.

561
00:55:39,431 --> 00:55:41,796
If you believe in him and in your mom...

562
00:55:41,867 --> 00:55:43,562
...and you believe in...

563
00:55:43,869 --> 00:55:45,201
...your dad...

564
00:55:46,372 --> 00:55:50,934
...and you've been good all year round, Santa Claus will bring you something.

565
00:55:51,544 --> 00:55:54,707
Sometimes I think all that Santa crap is just bull.

566
00:55:55,215 --> 00:55:58,548
If he was so real, how come we didn't get squat last year?

567
00:55:58,785 --> 00:56:02,223
We didn't do nothin' wrong and we still got the shaft.

568
00:56:02,389 --> 00:56:06,382
Well, I happen to know for a fact that Santa Claus is real.

569
00:56:07,127 --> 00:56:09,219
And in the next couple of days...

570
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:12,062
...somehow, I'm gonna prove it to you.

571
00:56:13,401 --> 00:56:16,461
Every year, he comes to our house. I've seen him.

572
00:56:17,739 --> 00:56:18,797
It's true?

573
00:56:19,073 --> 00:56:20,405
Cross my heart.

574
00:56:24,145 --> 00:56:26,340
It's a good idea you came to stay with us.

575
00:56:26,414 --> 00:56:30,577
I love it here. You don't gotta put on your coat to go to the bathroom.

576
00:56:30,752 --> 00:56:33,586
And your house is always parked in the same place.

577
00:56:37,093 --> 00:56:39,425
I think you better go back to bed, now.

578
00:56:43,265 --> 00:56:45,393
Okay. How come you ain't sleeping?

579
00:56:47,104 --> 00:56:49,265
I was looking for something.

580
00:56:52,944 --> 00:56:57,003
You didn't notice if a man came here and delivered a letter today, did you?

581
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,512
Nope. How come?

582
00:56:59,783 --> 00:57:01,444
Just wondering.

583
00:57:07,124 --> 00:57:09,286
Now you get back to bed. Come here.

584
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,898
Are you sure you ain't Santy Claus?

585
00:57:20,138 --> 00:57:21,162
I'm sure.

586
00:57:26,512 --> 00:57:28,480
I can't even afford to be an elf.

587
00:57:39,659 --> 00:57:43,822
I had two containers of K-rations... two containers...

588
00:57:44,163 --> 00:57:47,600
...and I had Spam until it was coming out of my ears!

589
00:57:58,845 --> 00:58:00,710
Aren't you having any breakfast?

590
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:02,442
No. Not in the mood.

591
00:58:04,019 --> 00:58:05,714
What are you looking at?

592
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:11,353
The silent majesty of a winter's morn. The clean...

593
00:58:11,525 --> 00:58:13,619
...cool chill of the holiday air.

594
00:58:13,794 --> 00:58:17,458
An asshole, in a bathrobe, emptying a chemical toilet into my sewer.

595
00:58:22,771 --> 00:58:24,295
The shitter was full.

596
00:58:25,207 --> 00:58:27,142
Have you checked our shitters, honey?

597
00:58:27,209 --> 00:58:29,701
Clark, please. He doesn't know any better.

598
00:58:30,046 --> 00:58:32,240
He ought to know it's illegal. It's a storm sewer.

599
00:58:32,314 --> 00:58:36,718
If it fills with gas, I pity the person who lights a match within ten yards of it.

600
00:58:59,243 --> 00:59:00,904
Merry Christmas.

601
00:59:01,345 --> 00:59:02,869
The shitter was full.

602
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:22,132
I have this suspicion that Catherine and Eddie don't have presents for their kids.

603
00:59:22,201 --> 00:59:26,866
Rocky said Eddie told him Santa Claus wasn't coming this year.

604
00:59:28,942 --> 00:59:33,878
Ruby Sue said the same thing last night. How can they have nothing for their kids?

605
00:59:33,946 --> 00:59:36,039
He's been out of work for almost seven years.

606
00:59:36,116 --> 00:59:38,381
In seven years he couldn't find a job?

607
00:59:38,452 --> 00:59:42,287
Catherine says he's been holding out for a management position.

608
00:59:46,292 --> 00:59:48,056
So, how's the live bait business?

609
00:59:48,128 --> 00:59:50,961
I can't complain. How you doing?

610
00:59:51,631 --> 00:59:53,293
Not that good, actually.

611
00:59:53,568 --> 00:59:57,231
Your company kill off all them people in India not long ago?

612
00:59:57,472 --> 00:59:59,736
No, we missed out on that one.

613
01:00:00,241 --> 01:00:02,732
You're pretty set so far as shopping goes?

614
01:00:03,144 --> 01:00:05,477
Well, I can't lie to you, Clark.

615
01:00:05,814 --> 01:00:08,409
The truth is, things ain't goin' too good at all.

616
01:00:08,485 --> 01:00:11,920
You know I told you I borrowed the RV from a neighbor?

617
01:00:12,554 --> 01:00:13,543
It's mine.

618
01:00:14,122 --> 01:00:15,317
We live in it.

619
01:00:15,591 --> 01:00:19,153
I had to sell off the house, the barn, the ten acres...

620
01:00:20,163 --> 01:00:24,657
All I kept was a 50-foot plot, the pigs and the worm farm.

621
01:00:27,003 --> 01:00:30,667
If I only had back the money me and Catherine sent that TV preacher...

622
01:00:30,741 --> 01:00:33,139
...that was screwin' the hockey players.

623
01:00:34,344 --> 01:00:35,674
What about the kids?

624
01:00:36,145 --> 01:00:38,170
His kids can fend for themselves.

625
01:00:38,448 --> 01:00:39,780
Your kids.

626
01:00:41,085 --> 01:00:43,816
That's the bitch of it. I don't know what to do.

627
01:00:43,854 --> 01:00:48,348
We coasted into town on fumes. The gas money give out in Guerney.

628
01:00:52,596 --> 01:00:55,795
Ellen and I want to help you give the kids a nice Christmas.

629
01:00:55,868 --> 01:00:58,028
No, Clark, I couldn't do that.

630
01:00:58,569 --> 01:00:59,628
We insist.

631
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:02,305
No, I'm not one for charity.

632
01:01:02,541 --> 01:01:05,977
I know that, Eddie. This isn't charity. It's family.

633
01:01:08,213 --> 01:01:10,148
I don't know about that.

634
01:01:10,382 --> 01:01:14,376
Now, come on, if you don't tell me what they want, I'll get it on my own.

635
01:01:19,559 --> 01:01:21,391
This is a surprise, Clark.

636
01:01:22,061 --> 01:01:24,222
This is a real nice surprise.

637
01:01:25,164 --> 01:01:27,725
Just a real nice surprise.

638
01:01:32,973 --> 01:01:33,996
Here's a list.

639
01:01:34,074 --> 01:01:36,564
Alphabetical, starting with Catherine.

640
01:01:37,077 --> 01:01:40,911
If it wouldn't be too much, I'd like to get something for you, Clark.

641
01:01:41,049 --> 01:01:43,540
Something really nice.

642
01:02:01,236 --> 01:02:03,032
Is your house on fire, Clark?

643
01:02:03,272 --> 01:02:05,297
No Bethany, those are Christmas lights.

644
01:02:05,374 --> 01:02:07,171
Don't throw me down, Clark.

645
01:02:07,276 --> 01:02:08,607
I'll try not to.

646
01:02:09,278 --> 01:02:11,109
Is this the airport?

647
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:12,608
We're here!

648
01:02:12,716 --> 01:02:16,277
Me and Bethany figured out the perfect gift for you.

649
01:02:16,385 --> 01:02:19,219
Uncle Louis, you didn't have to buy me anything.

650
01:02:19,289 --> 01:02:21,621
Damn it, Bethany, he guessed it.

651
01:02:22,291 --> 01:02:23,884
That was fun.

652
01:02:24,293 --> 01:02:26,625
I love riding in cars.

653
01:02:27,632 --> 01:02:29,964
When did you move to Florida?

654
01:02:33,070 --> 01:02:35,435
Are you still dating Clark?

655
01:02:39,076 --> 01:02:41,236
You know you shouldn't have done that.

656
01:02:41,312 --> 01:02:43,804
Oh, dear. Did I break wind?

657
01:02:44,483 --> 01:02:48,509
Jesus, did the room clear out, Bethany? Hell, no.

658
01:02:48,654 --> 01:02:51,747
She means presents. You shouldn't have bought presents.

659
01:02:51,823 --> 01:02:55,759
It isn't every day somebody moves into a new house.

660
01:02:55,927 --> 01:02:58,088
They didn't move into a new house.

661
01:03:00,399 --> 01:03:01,627
In the living room.

662
01:03:03,670 --> 01:03:06,002
This house is bigger than your old one.

663
01:03:07,739 --> 01:03:09,901
Is Rusty still in the Navy?

664
01:03:11,176 --> 01:03:15,512
Why don't you go into the living room and say hello to everybody?

665
01:03:15,849 --> 01:03:18,943
Hello, everybody! I should say it?

666
01:03:23,222 --> 01:03:24,621
- Mom? - What?

667
01:03:25,025 --> 01:03:26,855
This box is meowing.

668
01:03:33,668 --> 01:03:35,294
She wrapped up her damn cat.

669
01:03:35,536 --> 01:03:38,471
- Take it in the kitchen. Open it up. - And have a cat running around?

670
01:03:38,539 --> 01:03:39,973
We can't leave it in the box.

671
01:03:40,041 --> 01:03:42,532
Why would somebody wrap up a cat in a box?

672
01:03:42,877 --> 01:03:44,845
She gets confused. She's old.

673
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:48,040
They don't have much money, so she takes things from the house...

674
01:03:48,116 --> 01:03:50,277
...wraps them up, gives them away as presents.

675
01:03:50,351 --> 01:03:51,909
Can't wait to see what I got!

676
01:03:51,986 --> 01:03:53,647
This one here...

677
01:03:53,888 --> 01:03:55,150
...is leaking.

678
01:04:01,297 --> 01:04:02,025
Lime.

679
01:04:02,498 --> 01:04:03,965
It's her Jell-O mold.

680
01:04:04,033 --> 01:04:08,231
I'll take it, Eddie. Go into the living room and enjoy yourself.

681
01:04:11,506 --> 01:04:13,236
Let's go find your sister.

682
01:04:34,466 --> 01:04:35,626
Before we begin...

683
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:38,928
...since this is Aunt Bethany's 80th Christmas...

684
01:04:39,437 --> 01:04:42,406
...I think she should lead us in the saying of grace.

685
01:04:46,544 --> 01:04:47,672
What, dear?

686
01:04:49,747 --> 01:04:50,578
Grace!

687
01:04:52,117 --> 01:04:55,519
Grace? She passed away 30 years ago.

688
01:04:56,556 --> 01:04:58,786
They want you to say grace.

689
01:05:01,627 --> 01:05:03,789
The blessing.

690
01:05:20,681 --> 01:05:22,081
"I pledge allegiance...

691
01:05:22,317 --> 01:05:25,979
"...to the flag of the United States of America...

692
01:05:26,419 --> 01:05:28,081
"...and to the republic...

693
01:05:28,321 --> 01:05:32,588
"...for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible...

694
01:05:33,161 --> 01:05:36,494
"...with liberty and justice for all."

695
01:05:38,667 --> 01:05:39,395
Amen.

696
01:05:45,674 --> 01:05:49,610
Catherine, if this turkey tastes half as good as it looks...

697
01:05:49,846 --> 01:05:52,440
...I think we're all in for a very big treat.

698
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:58,450
Save the neck for me, Clark.

699
01:06:14,972 --> 01:06:16,131
I'm sorry.

700
01:06:17,174 --> 01:06:18,232
Why are you crying?

701
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:20,800
I told you we put it in too early.

702
01:06:21,446 --> 01:06:23,710
It's just a little dry. It's fine.

703
01:06:26,451 --> 01:06:27,508
Here's the heart.

704
01:07:28,517 --> 01:07:29,814
Aunt Bethany...

705
01:07:31,453 --> 01:07:33,579
Does your cat happen to eat Jell-O?

706
01:07:35,891 --> 01:07:37,792
I don't know about the cat...

707
01:07:38,193 --> 01:07:39,558
...but I'm enjoying it.

708
01:07:52,908 --> 01:07:53,740
Kids...

709
01:07:54,645 --> 01:07:55,737
...I heard on the news...

710
01:07:55,812 --> 01:08:00,443
...that an airline pilot spotted Santa's sled on its way in from New York.

711
01:08:06,322 --> 01:08:07,550
You serious, Clark?

712
01:08:10,595 --> 01:08:14,086
Load me up with a little more there. It's good.

713
01:08:24,944 --> 01:08:26,672
What's wrong with the dog?

714
01:08:30,349 --> 01:08:35,115
He's just yackin' on a bone. He's got it up. He's all right now.

715
01:08:36,922 --> 01:08:39,482
Maybe if you wouldn't feed him from the table...

716
01:08:41,027 --> 01:08:42,688
No.

717
01:08:43,529 --> 01:08:46,521
He's probably just nosing through the trash.

718
01:08:56,676 --> 01:08:59,043
If you're not doing anything constructive...

719
01:08:59,113 --> 01:09:01,741
...run into the living room, get my stogie.

720
01:09:03,216 --> 01:09:06,151
Is there anything else I can do for you, Uncle Louis?

721
01:09:06,586 --> 01:09:08,953
He's an old man. This may be his last Christmas.

722
01:09:10,157 --> 01:09:12,889
He keeps it up, it will be his last Christmas.

723
01:09:46,629 --> 01:09:47,926
That should be it.

724
01:10:04,347 --> 01:10:06,907
I told you, you had too many plugs in one outlet.

725
01:10:09,488 --> 01:10:10,419
What is it?

726
01:10:12,692 --> 01:10:15,627
Nothing. Let's go in and finish our dessert.

727
01:10:18,395 --> 01:10:21,456
If that thing had nine lives, she just spent them all.

728
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:30,464
If you don't mind, I'd like to try to fumigate this here chair.

729
01:10:31,177 --> 01:10:32,974
It's a good quality item.

730
01:10:35,081 --> 01:10:39,143
If you don't mind me askin', how much it set you back?

731
01:10:40,186 --> 01:10:41,778
Do you smell something?

732
01:10:44,057 --> 01:10:45,489
Fried pussycat.

733
01:10:48,228 --> 01:10:51,857
It's not the chair, it's some kind of gas coming from the sewer.

734
01:11:41,850 --> 01:11:43,147
My tree!

735
01:11:45,354 --> 01:11:47,381
So, what's the matter with you?

736
01:11:48,392 --> 01:11:50,485
Look what you've done to my tree!

737
01:12:05,877 --> 01:12:07,845
It was an ugly tree anyway.

738
01:12:08,679 --> 01:12:10,739
At least it's out of its misery.

739
01:12:11,416 --> 01:12:13,440
- Dad's gonna flip out. - Nobody's gonna flip out.

740
01:12:13,518 --> 01:12:15,986
We're gonna have a wonderful Christmas.

741
01:12:19,559 --> 01:12:20,957
What the hell do you want?

742
01:12:21,026 --> 01:12:23,825
I have a delivery for Clark W. Griswold.

743
01:12:23,997 --> 01:12:26,227
I was supposed to deliver it yesterday...

744
01:12:26,366 --> 01:12:30,700
...but it fell between the seats and I didn't see it. I'm sorry.

745
01:12:37,878 --> 01:12:39,209
Merry Christmas.

746
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:41,777
Merry Christmas.

747
01:12:45,719 --> 01:12:47,482
- I can't believe it. - What is it?

748
01:12:48,155 --> 01:12:50,989
A letter confirming your reservation at the nuthouse?

749
01:12:51,626 --> 01:12:52,820
It's from my company.

750
01:12:53,628 --> 01:12:54,423
Your bonus.

751
01:12:55,162 --> 01:12:56,060
My bonus.

752
01:13:01,835 --> 01:13:03,634
Open it, Clarkie. Open it.

753
01:13:04,307 --> 01:13:06,467
I hope it's a fortune.

754
01:13:07,142 --> 01:13:08,404
I bet you do.

755
01:13:13,281 --> 01:13:14,305
I was afraid...

756
01:13:14,582 --> 01:13:18,416
Are you going to bawl all over it, or are you gonna open it?

757
01:13:20,656 --> 01:13:24,524
I was gonna wait till tomorrow to tell you all this, but what the heck?

758
01:13:25,394 --> 01:13:28,762
With this bonus check, I'm putting in a swimming pool.

759
01:13:33,102 --> 01:13:35,333
That's it. That's the big one!

760
01:13:37,774 --> 01:13:38,832
Open it!

761
01:13:41,579 --> 01:13:45,014
I'm sorry if I've been a little short with everyone lately.

762
01:13:45,582 --> 01:13:47,379
I've been waiting for this bonus.

763
01:13:47,651 --> 01:13:49,780
To make sure the pool goes in when the ground thaws...

764
01:13:49,855 --> 01:13:51,845
...I had to lay out the money in advance.

765
01:13:51,923 --> 01:13:56,086
Until this arrived, I didn't have enough to cover the check.

766
01:13:56,426 --> 01:13:58,622
Tear the sucker open, Dad.

767
01:14:00,365 --> 01:14:01,195
Drum roll.

768
01:14:10,109 --> 01:14:14,205
If there's enough left, I'll fly you all down to help us dedicate it.

769
01:14:18,317 --> 01:14:19,875
I can't swim, Clark.

770
01:14:21,254 --> 01:14:22,551
I know that, Eddie.

771
01:14:37,538 --> 01:14:38,732
What's wrong?

772
01:14:42,077 --> 01:14:44,408
It's bigger than you expected?

773
01:14:48,115 --> 01:14:49,082
Smaller?

774
01:14:51,921 --> 01:14:53,080
What is it?

775
01:14:54,891 --> 01:14:58,690
A one-year membership in the Jelly-of-the-Month Club.

776
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:03,854
That's the gift that keeps on giving the whole year.

777
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:07,068
That it is, Edward.

778
01:15:08,036 --> 01:15:09,197
That it is, indeed.

779
01:15:10,106 --> 01:15:11,266
I'm sorry.

780
01:15:13,443 --> 01:15:18,278
If this isn't the biggest bag-over-the-head punch in the face I ever got! Goddamn it!

781
01:15:19,316 --> 01:15:20,111
Son.

782
01:15:33,563 --> 01:15:35,224
It's good.

783
01:15:44,175 --> 01:15:47,770
If any of you are looking for any last-minute gift ideas for me...

784
01:15:47,846 --> 01:15:49,143
...I have one.

785
01:15:49,914 --> 01:15:52,644
I'd like Frank Shirley, my boss, right here, tonight.

786
01:15:53,652 --> 01:15:57,986
Brought from his happy holiday slumber on Melody Lane with all the rich people.

787
01:15:58,156 --> 01:16:00,148
I want him brought right here...

788
01:16:00,493 --> 01:16:04,827
...with a big ribbon on his head and I want to look him straight in the eye...

789
01:16:05,097 --> 01:16:08,588
...and I want to tell him what a cheap, lying, no good, rotten...

790
01:16:08,666 --> 01:16:11,864
...low-life, snake-licking, dirt-eating, inbred, overstuffed...

791
01:16:12,005 --> 01:16:16,533
...ignorant, bloodsucking, brainless, dickless, hopeless...

792
01:16:17,010 --> 01:16:20,672
...heartless, fat-assed, bug-eyed, stiff-legged, spotty-lipped...

793
01:16:20,847 --> 01:16:23,839
...worm-headed sack of monkey shit he is!

794
01:16:24,184 --> 01:16:25,515
Hallelujah!

795
01:16:25,953 --> 01:16:28,353
Holy shit! Where's the Tylenol?

796
01:16:41,970 --> 01:16:43,904
He has that crazy look in his eye.

797
01:16:43,972 --> 01:16:46,303
I told you we should have gone to Hawaii.

798
01:16:46,641 --> 01:16:49,202
Turn that thing off and get in the house!

799
01:16:49,978 --> 01:16:51,639
I'll talk to him, Mom.

800
01:16:55,217 --> 01:16:56,583
You know, Dad...

801
01:16:56,718 --> 01:16:58,310
...l've been thinking.

802
01:16:59,888 --> 01:17:01,322
Good talk.

803
01:17:07,163 --> 01:17:10,131
Aren't you a teeny bit sorry we didn't get a Christmas tree?

804
01:17:10,232 --> 01:17:13,396
Even though they're dirty and messy and corny and clich閐?

805
01:17:13,903 --> 01:17:17,067
Where are you going to find a tree at this hour on Christmas Eve?

806
01:17:36,394 --> 01:17:37,291
What's the matter?

807
01:17:39,598 --> 01:17:40,860
Was that really necessary?

808
01:17:43,368 --> 01:17:44,631
We needed a tree.

809
01:17:44,704 --> 01:17:46,364
May I remind you that...

810
01:17:46,538 --> 01:17:49,701
That this was all my idea? No, no. I'm well aware of that.

811
01:17:50,443 --> 01:17:53,776
Could you just keep it in mind the next time you go berserk?

812
01:17:54,113 --> 01:17:57,276
I didn't go berserk. I simply solved a problem.

813
01:17:59,552 --> 01:18:01,110
We needed a coffin.

814
01:18:02,455 --> 01:18:06,051
A tree. There are no lots open on Christmas Eve.

815
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:10,395
Louis burned down my tree so I replaced it as best I could. Voil?..

816
01:18:10,963 --> 01:18:12,191
Are you okay?

817
01:18:12,298 --> 01:18:13,891
I'm fine, honey.

818
01:18:38,493 --> 01:18:40,155
I fixed the newel post.

819
01:19:03,219 --> 01:19:04,618
What's that sound?

820
01:19:26,544 --> 01:19:27,875
Do you hear it?

821
01:19:28,879 --> 01:19:31,314
It's a funny, squeaking sound.

822
01:19:32,050 --> 01:19:36,543
You couldn't hear a dump truck driving through a nitroglycerin plant.

823
01:19:38,056 --> 01:19:39,353
I hear it, too.

824
01:19:48,367 --> 01:19:49,391
I don't hear it anymore.

825
01:19:54,742 --> 01:19:56,073
Squirrel!

826
01:20:03,851 --> 01:20:05,751
What was it? Oh, my God!

827
01:20:12,092 --> 01:20:13,422
Quiet! Shut up!

828
01:20:27,108 --> 01:20:28,439
Mom, don't move.

829
01:20:30,945 --> 01:20:33,073
We can't let it out of the living room.

830
01:20:34,251 --> 01:20:37,117
Where's Eddie? He usually eats these goddamn things.

831
01:20:37,453 --> 01:20:41,048
Not recently, Clark. He read that squirrels were high in cholesterol.

832
01:20:42,291 --> 01:20:43,553
Thank you, Catherine.

833
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:46,288
I'll try and trap it.

834
01:20:46,462 --> 01:20:47,519
Russ!

835
01:20:47,762 --> 01:20:48,787
We're here, Dad.

836
01:20:49,431 --> 01:20:50,455
There you are.

837
01:20:51,635 --> 01:20:53,033
Go get the hammer.

838
01:20:53,302 --> 01:20:55,237
What do you need a hammer for?

839
01:20:55,472 --> 01:20:59,238
I'll catch it in the coat and smack it with the hammer.

840
01:21:06,651 --> 01:21:08,243
I'm going in with him.

841
01:21:11,988 --> 01:21:13,149
Nora?

842
01:21:16,761 --> 01:21:17,750
Is it gone?

843
01:21:17,828 --> 01:21:20,321
It probably got scared and ran back into the tree.

844
01:21:21,098 --> 01:21:22,828
Squirrel!

845
01:22:01,574 --> 01:22:05,705
You just march right over there and slug that creep in the face.

846
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:07,405
I can't just attack someone.

847
01:22:07,482 --> 01:22:11,714
All right, then. If you're not man enough to put an end to this shit, then I am.

848
01:22:33,509 --> 01:22:34,203
Gone.

849
01:22:39,749 --> 01:22:41,341
Oh, my God.

850
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:46,011
What happened to you?

851
01:22:58,936 --> 01:23:01,598
Where do you think you're going? Nobody's leaving.

852
01:23:01,939 --> 01:23:04,806
Nobody walks out on this old-fashioned family Christmas.

853
01:23:04,875 --> 01:23:07,276
No, we're all in this together.

854
01:23:07,613 --> 01:23:10,605
This is a full-blown, four-alarm holiday emergency.

855
01:23:10,883 --> 01:23:14,215
We're going to press on and have the happiest Christmas...

856
01:23:14,385 --> 01:23:17,218
...since Bing Crosby tap-danced with Danny fucking Kaye.

857
01:23:17,288 --> 01:23:20,314
And when Santa squeezes his fat, white ass down the chimney...

858
01:23:20,392 --> 01:23:24,385
...he's gonna find the jolliest bunch of assholes this side of the nuthouse.

859
01:23:24,597 --> 01:23:25,824
You're goofy.

860
01:23:26,131 --> 01:23:27,792
Don't piss me off, Art.

861
01:23:28,968 --> 01:23:32,062
- It's over. - Not according to Santa's watch, it isn't.

862
01:23:32,138 --> 01:23:33,400
Stay out of this, Dad.

863
01:23:33,473 --> 01:23:36,566
Clark, I think it's best if everyone just goes home.

864
01:23:36,910 --> 01:23:38,502
Before things get worse.

865
01:23:38,578 --> 01:23:41,570
Worse?! How could they get any worse?

866
01:23:41,815 --> 01:23:45,808
Look around you, Ellen. We're at the threshold of hell!

867
01:24:03,838 --> 01:24:04,827
Son.

868
01:24:06,674 --> 01:24:09,006
I love you. We all love you.

869
01:24:09,343 --> 01:24:12,836
But this is a terrible night. Nothing's gone right. It's a disaster.

870
01:24:13,616 --> 01:24:16,448
But losing your temper only makes things worse.

871
01:24:16,684 --> 01:24:19,347
You're too good a father to act like this.

872
01:24:21,356 --> 01:24:26,021
In years to come, you'll want your family to remember all the love you gave us...

873
01:24:26,294 --> 01:24:29,355
...and how hard you tried to make the perfect Christmas.

874
01:24:29,966 --> 01:24:31,558
You just cocked it up.

875
01:24:34,537 --> 01:24:36,870
It's okay. It happens.

876
01:24:38,974 --> 01:24:41,308
All our holidays were always such a mess.

877
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:45,177
How did you get through it?

878
01:24:46,050 --> 01:24:48,042
I had a lot of help from Jack Daniels.

879
01:24:57,729 --> 01:24:59,060
I love you.

880
01:25:03,668 --> 01:25:05,829
Will you recite "The Night Before Christmas"?

881
01:25:05,904 --> 01:25:08,236
No. It's your house.

882
01:25:08,506 --> 01:25:10,064
It's your Christmas.

883
01:25:11,242 --> 01:25:12,835
I'm retiring.

884
01:25:14,213 --> 01:25:17,080
"The children were nestled All snug in their beds

885
01:25:17,416 --> 01:25:20,408
"While visions of sugarplums Danced in their heads

886
01:25:21,020 --> 01:25:22,510
"And Mama in her kerchief

887
01:25:22,588 --> 01:25:26,582
"And I in my cap, just settled our brains For a long winter's nap

888
01:25:26,858 --> 01:25:30,351
"When out on the lawn There arose such a clatter

889
01:25:30,464 --> 01:25:32,694
"I sprang from my bed To see what was the matter

890
01:25:32,766 --> 01:25:34,893
"Away to the window I flew like a flash

891
01:25:35,068 --> 01:25:37,401
"Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash

892
01:25:37,604 --> 01:25:39,594
"The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow

893
01:25:39,673 --> 01:25:42,198
"Gave a luster of midday to objects below

894
01:25:42,374 --> 01:25:44,707
"When what to my wondering eyes should appear

895
01:25:44,812 --> 01:25:46,507
"But a miniature sleigh..."

896
01:25:48,249 --> 01:25:49,113
...and Eddie.

897
01:25:49,450 --> 01:25:52,112
And a man in his pajamas with a dog chain...

898
01:25:52,285 --> 01:25:54,720
...tied to his wrists and ankles. What the...?

899
01:25:57,124 --> 01:25:58,286
Stay here.

900
01:26:04,632 --> 01:26:06,691
Merry Christmas, Clark.

901
01:26:07,969 --> 01:26:10,802
You about ready to do some kissin'?

902
01:26:12,474 --> 01:26:15,239
Officer, it seems my husband has been abducted.

903
01:26:15,477 --> 01:26:19,141
The man was wearing a blue leisure suit...

904
01:26:20,649 --> 01:26:25,587
...and the plates were from Kansas. He was a huge, beastly, bulging man.

905
01:26:25,922 --> 01:26:28,253
I have never been treated like this in my life.

906
01:26:28,490 --> 01:26:30,823
I'm sorry. This is our family's first kidnapping.

907
01:26:31,861 --> 01:26:33,089
You're fired.

908
01:26:33,497 --> 01:26:35,327
Where's the phone? I'm calling the police.

909
01:26:35,399 --> 01:26:37,390
Just hold your wad there, fella.

910
01:26:37,668 --> 01:26:41,502
Clark had nothin' to do with this. This here was my idea.

911
01:26:41,772 --> 01:26:45,334
All right. He's still fired and you are going to jail.

912
01:26:47,178 --> 01:26:48,770
It was my fault.

913
01:26:49,848 --> 01:26:54,011
I lost my temper when I got my bonus and I said a few things I shouldn't have.

914
01:26:54,185 --> 01:26:58,849
Bonus? How did you get a bonus? I cut out bonuses this year.

915
01:27:00,026 --> 01:27:01,550
Thanks for telling us.

916
01:27:01,627 --> 01:27:04,959
I was expecting a check. Instead I got enrolled in a jelly club.

917
01:27:05,530 --> 01:27:09,524
In 17 years with the company, I've gotten a bonus every year, but this one.

918
01:27:09,869 --> 01:27:11,803
You don't want to give bonuses, fine!

919
01:27:11,970 --> 01:27:14,337
When people count on them as part of their salary...

920
01:27:14,573 --> 01:27:16,303
What you did just plain...

921
01:27:16,442 --> 01:27:17,500
Sucks.

922
01:27:19,378 --> 01:27:20,710
Thank you, Russ.

923
01:27:24,383 --> 01:27:27,217
My cousin-in-law, whose heart is bigger than his brain...

924
01:27:27,487 --> 01:27:29,044
I appreciate that.

925
01:27:30,389 --> 01:27:33,485
...is innocent. I'll be more than happy to take the rap on this...

926
01:27:33,894 --> 01:27:37,888
...on behalf of myself and every other employee you rear-ended this Christmas.

927
01:28:00,021 --> 01:28:02,924
Sometimes things look good on paper, but...

928
01:28:03,193 --> 01:28:07,094
...lose their luster when you see how it affects real folks.

929
01:28:08,097 --> 01:28:10,588
A healthy bottom line doesn't mean much if...

930
01:28:10,666 --> 01:28:13,760
...to get it, you have to hurt the ones you depend on.

931
01:28:15,939 --> 01:28:20,433
It's people that make the difference. Little people, like you.

932
01:28:23,046 --> 01:28:25,037
So, Carl...

933
01:28:26,784 --> 01:28:28,808
...whatever you got last year...

934
01:28:29,451 --> 01:28:31,784
...add 20 percent.

935
01:29:24,845 --> 01:29:26,836
Go away, Todd.

936
01:29:27,981 --> 01:29:32,509
If you want to come in, you are gonna have to break down the goddamn door!

937
01:29:43,697 --> 01:29:46,861
Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night!

938
01:29:58,380 --> 01:29:59,541
Freeze!

939
01:30:01,717 --> 01:30:03,549
Not you! Them!

940
01:30:13,396 --> 01:30:14,728
This way, please.

941
01:30:17,734 --> 01:30:19,667
I think you've made a terrible mistake.

942
01:30:20,002 --> 01:30:21,494
I told you to freeze, mister.

943
01:30:21,739 --> 01:30:22,966
May we blink?

944
01:30:29,747 --> 01:30:32,738
- Thank God you're all right. - I'm fine. I'm just fine.

945
01:30:33,083 --> 01:30:35,074
There was a big misunderstanding tonight.

946
01:30:35,620 --> 01:30:40,058
Excuse me. Would you and Mrs. Shirley like to step outside so we can finish here?

947
01:30:41,093 --> 01:30:43,686
- Don't bother. I'm not pressing charges. - What?

948
01:30:44,763 --> 01:30:46,060
It was a mistake.

949
01:30:46,130 --> 01:30:48,861
Mistake? Honey, you were kidnapped.

950
01:30:49,201 --> 01:30:51,260
I did something I shouldn't have...

951
01:30:51,437 --> 01:30:56,033
...and these people called me on it. This is Clark Griswold and his family.

952
01:30:56,442 --> 01:30:57,932
Welcome to our home.

953
01:30:59,278 --> 01:31:00,678
What's left of it.

954
01:31:00,780 --> 01:31:02,144
Release B Squad.

955
01:31:02,448 --> 01:31:03,882
What's going on here?

956
01:31:04,117 --> 01:31:08,451
Remember how I was toying with the notion of suspending Christmas bonuses?

957
01:31:09,122 --> 01:31:10,453
You didn't.

958
01:31:10,723 --> 01:31:14,057
Of all the cheap, lousy ways to save a buck!

959
01:31:14,294 --> 01:31:15,728
That's pretty low, mister.

960
01:31:16,297 --> 01:31:17,889
If I had a rubber hose...

961
01:31:17,965 --> 01:31:20,296
I changed my mind. I'm reinstating all the bonuses.

962
01:31:25,907 --> 01:31:27,568
Look!

963
01:31:29,978 --> 01:31:31,137
Look!

964
01:31:37,818 --> 01:31:39,480
It's Santy Claus.

965
01:31:43,325 --> 01:31:45,486
Uncle Clark, it's Santy Claus.

966
01:31:46,995 --> 01:31:48,690
It's the Christmas star.

967
01:31:49,165 --> 01:31:50,996
And that's all that matters tonight.

968
01:31:52,668 --> 01:31:56,502
Not bonuses or gifts or turkeys or trees.

969
01:31:57,106 --> 01:31:58,437
See, kids...

970
01:31:59,442 --> 01:32:01,843
It means something different to everybody.

971
01:32:04,114 --> 01:32:05,910
Now I know what it means to me.

972
01:32:07,849 --> 01:32:10,183
That ain't the frigging Christmas star.

973
01:32:10,354 --> 01:32:13,517
It's the light on the sewage treatment plant.

974
01:32:13,790 --> 01:32:15,121
Sewer gas.

975
01:32:17,128 --> 01:32:18,493
Don't drop that!

976
01:32:28,540 --> 01:32:31,032
"And the rocket's red glare

977
01:32:32,042 --> 01:32:35,206
"The bombs bursting in air

978
01:32:35,980 --> 01:32:38,211
"Gave proof through the night

979
01:32:39,317 --> 01:32:42,811
"That our flag was still there

980
01:32:43,889 --> 01:32:46,050
"Oh, say does that

981
01:32:46,125 --> 01:32:50,721
"Star-spangled banner yet wave

982
01:32:53,065 --> 01:32:56,057
"O'er the land of the free

983
01:32:58,738 --> 01:33:02,732
"And the home of the brave?"

984
01:33:07,248 --> 01:33:08,839
Play ball!

985
01:33:16,924 --> 01:33:18,915
Merry Christmas, Sparky.

986
01:33:19,928 --> 01:33:21,554
Merry Christmas, honey.

987
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:51,787
I did it.
