1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,418
This is the night

2
00:00:03,585 --> 00:00:07,087
It's a beautiful night

3
00:00:07,254 --> 00:00:12,257
And they call it bella notte

4
00:00:14,383 --> 00:00:17,217
Look at the skies

5
00:00:17,343 --> 00:00:21,095
They have stars
in their eyes

6
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:26,765
On this lovely bella notte

7
00:00:28,183 --> 00:00:33,769
So take the love
Of your loved one

8
00:00:35,311 --> 00:00:39,938
You'll need it
about this time

9
00:00:41,898 --> 00:00:46,942
To keep from falling
like a star

10
00:00:47,068 --> 00:00:51,403
When you make
that dizzy climb

11
00:00:51,528 --> 00:00:56,907
For this is the night

12
00:00:57,032 --> 00:01:01,576
And the heavens
are right

13
00:01:02,952 --> 00:01:05,954
On this lovely

14
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:11,247
Bella notte

15
00:01:12,832 --> 00:01:15,501
On this lovely

16
00:01:15,668 --> 00:01:21,170
Bella notte

17
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,353
Silent as the snowflake
in the night

18
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,314
Holy is the spirit
Of this night

19
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,900
All the world is calm
And peaceful

20
00:02:00,067 --> 00:02:05,028
All the world
is bright and joyful

21
00:02:05,195 --> 00:02:09,114
Spirit of love

22
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:14,950
And child of peace

23
00:02:15,075 --> 00:02:19,536
Love unending

24
00:02:19,703 --> 00:02:25,164
That shall not cease

25
00:02:25,331 --> 00:02:30,500
Peace, my children

26
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:36,004
Of good will

27
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:38,672
Peace, my children

28
00:02:38,797 --> 00:02:44,008
Peace, best all

29
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:50,803
It's for you, darling.
Merry Christmas.

30
00:02:50,928 --> 00:02:53,096
Oh, Jim dear!

31
00:02:53,263 --> 00:02:57,432
It's the one I was admiring, isn't it?
Trimmed with ribbons?

32
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,559
Uh, well, it has a ribbon.

33
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,729
Oh, how sweet!

34
00:03:05,896 --> 00:03:08,855
- You like her, darling?
- Oh, I love her.

35
00:03:12,399 --> 00:03:15,942
What a perfectly beautiful little lady.

36
00:03:26,782 --> 00:03:29,241
Come on, Lady.
Over here.

37
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,577
That's a girl.

38
00:03:33,952 --> 00:03:37,538
There now.
A nice little bed for you.

39
00:03:37,705 --> 00:03:40,873
But, Jim dear, are you sure
she'll be warm enough?

40
00:03:40,998 --> 00:03:45,209
Why, of course, darling.
She'll be snug as a bug in a... Uh-oh.

41
00:03:45,334 --> 00:03:48,711
Almost forgot something.
There.

42
00:03:50,378 --> 00:03:52,379
Good night, Lady.
Now, now.

43
00:03:52,546 --> 00:03:55,298
Don't worry, darling.
She'll go right to sleep.

44
00:03:57,799 --> 00:03:59,717
No, no, Lady.

45
00:04:01,218 --> 00:04:03,052
This is where you belong.

46
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:05,386
Right here.

47
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:25,731
Ah, look. She's lonesome.

48
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:29,234
Don't you think maybe
just for tonight?

49
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:31,944
Now, darling, if we're going
to show her who's master...

50
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,403
we must be firm
from the very beginning.

51
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,591
Lady! Stop that now!

52
00:05:12,716 --> 00:05:14,592
Stop it!

53
00:05:32,185 --> 00:05:35,437
Lady, quiet now!
Do ya hear me?

54
00:05:35,563 --> 00:05:38,522
Back to bed.
Quick now.

55
00:05:40,731 --> 00:05:42,774
Not one more sound.

56
00:06:49,145 --> 00:06:52,147
- Aw, Jim.
- Hmm? What? What?

57
00:06:52,938 --> 00:06:54,814
Oh.

58
00:06:59,942 --> 00:07:01,818
Oh, all right.

59
00:07:02,777 --> 00:07:05,446
But remember, just for tonight.

60
00:07:47,928 --> 00:07:50,012
All right, Lady. All right.

61
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:52,847
I'm up. I'm up, Lady. I...

62
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,349
Oh, no!

63
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:57,517
What's wrong, Jim?
What is it?

64
00:07:57,642 --> 00:07:59,893
Can't you explain to Lady
about Sundays?

65
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:15,518
Have you noticed, darling,
since we've had Lady...

66
00:09:15,643 --> 00:09:19,437
we see less and less
of those disturbing headlines?

67
00:09:19,603 --> 00:09:23,981
Yes, I just don't know
how we ever got along without her.

68
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:27,108
Say, she must be about six months old.

69
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,651
We'd better be getting her a license.

70
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,660
Hope it fits.

71
00:09:46,827 --> 00:09:49,370
My, but it does look nice.

72
00:09:49,495 --> 00:09:54,665
So grown up.
Won't Jock and Trusty be surprised?

73
00:10:10,007 --> 00:10:13,134
Four steps ahead
Then to the left

74
00:10:13,301 --> 00:10:16,844
And right to the place
where I marked it

75
00:10:17,011 --> 00:10:20,763
With a bonny, bonny bone
that I'll bury for me own

76
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:25,432
In my bonny, bonny bank
in the backyard

77
00:10:25,599 --> 00:10:29,851
- Ah, that's a grand sight!
- Jock!

78
00:10:31,852 --> 00:10:33,687
Oh, Jock!

79
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:44,109
- Hello, Jock.
- Oh, oh, i-it's you, lassie.

80
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:46,277
Notice anything different?

81
00:10:46,402 --> 00:10:51,113
- Eh, uh, y-you've had a bath?
- No, not that.

82
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,698
You've had your nails clipped?

83
00:10:53,865 --> 00:10:56,450
Uh-uh. Guess again.

84
00:10:56,616 --> 00:11:00,702
Well, I-I wouldn't a-be a-knowin' then.

85
00:11:03,995 --> 00:11:07,498
Why-o, lassie,
a bonny new collar.

86
00:11:07,664 --> 00:11:09,791
- Do you like it?
- Aye.

87
00:11:10,749 --> 00:11:13,834
Mmm, it must be very expensive.

88
00:11:15,043 --> 00:11:17,169
- Have you shown it to Trusty yet?
- No.

89
00:11:17,336 --> 00:11:20,004
Ah, we'd best go at once.

90
00:11:20,088 --> 00:11:23,173
You know how sensitive he is
about these things.

91
00:11:43,643 --> 00:11:45,143
He's dreaming.

92
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:49,646
Aye. Dreaming of those
bonny bygone days when...

93
00:11:49,813 --> 00:11:53,481
he and his grandfather were
trackin' criminals through the swamps.

94
00:11:53,606 --> 00:11:54,982
They were?

95
00:11:55,108 --> 00:11:57,983
But that was before...

96
00:11:58,109 --> 00:11:59,984
Before what?

97
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,987
This time you knew the truth, lassie.

98
00:12:03,112 --> 00:12:05,863
It shouldn't have happened to a dog.

99
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,532
But, well...

100
00:12:08,699 --> 00:12:11,866
Trusty has lost his sense of smell.

101
00:12:13,076 --> 00:12:14,410
- No!
- Aye.

102
00:12:15,077 --> 00:12:18,745
But we must never let on
that we know, lassie.

103
00:12:18,912 --> 00:12:21,747
'T would break his poor heart.

104
00:12:28,501 --> 00:12:32,670
Uh, uh, uh, which way'd he go?
Which way did he go?

105
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:35,714
- Go?
- Yeah! Big fella.

106
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,297
'Bout, uh, six foot two.

107
00:12:38,423 --> 00:12:42,883
No, uh, three.
Wore a stripped suit. No collar.

108
00:12:44,302 --> 00:12:47,469
Why, Miss Lady!

109
00:12:47,594 --> 00:12:49,513
You have a collar.

110
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:52,180
Mm-hmm. And a license.

111
00:12:52,306 --> 00:12:56,349
My, my, how time does fly.

112
00:12:56,516 --> 00:13:00,019
Aye. It seems only yesterday
she was cuttin' her teeth...

113
00:13:00,185 --> 00:13:02,854
on Jim Dear's slippers.

114
00:13:03,021 --> 00:13:06,105
And now, there she is,
a full-grown lady.

115
00:13:06,272 --> 00:13:10,774
Wearin' the greatest honor
man can bestow.

116
00:13:10,941 --> 00:13:13,276
The badge of faith and respectability.

117
00:13:14,943 --> 00:13:17,069
That's right, Miss Lady.

118
00:13:17,236 --> 00:13:21,947
A-As my grand pappy,
Old Reliable, used to say...

119
00:13:22,114 --> 00:13:25,199
Don't recollect if I've ever mentioned
Old Reliable before.

120
00:13:25,325 --> 00:13:27,576
Aye, you have, laddie.

121
00:13:27,743 --> 00:13:29,577
Oh, yeah.

122
00:13:30,619 --> 00:13:32,494
Oh, it's Jim Dear.

123
00:13:33,662 --> 00:13:35,580
Please excuse me.

124
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,042
Hello there, Lady.

125
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,084
Come on. Beat ya home.

126
00:13:49,296 --> 00:13:51,380
Ah, you win again.

127
00:13:51,547 --> 00:13:55,132
Steady now. Steady.

128
00:13:55,299 --> 00:13:57,550
Well, what have we here?

129
00:13:57,675 --> 00:14:00,969
Oh, big girl now, huh?
All right.

130
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,554
Oh, ladies first.

131
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:14,518
You know, darling, with Lady here
I'd say life is quite complete.

132
00:14:14,644 --> 00:14:19,438
Yes, dear. I don't imagine anything
could ever take her place in our hearts.

133
00:15:04,505 --> 00:15:06,422
What a day!

134
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:09,924
Well, now to dig up some breakfast.

135
00:15:22,556 --> 00:15:25,891
Cute little rascals.

136
00:15:26,016 --> 00:15:28,601
Coochie, coochie, coochie, coochie, coo.

137
00:15:30,352 --> 00:15:34,980
Now, that breakfast.
Let's see. Bernie's?

138
00:15:36,939 --> 00:15:39,315
No. Francois?

139
00:15:39,482 --> 00:15:42,442
Oh, no, no. Nope. Too much starch.

140
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:45,319
Ah, Tony's!
Oh, that's it.

141
00:15:46,736 --> 00:15:48,654
Haven't been there in a week.

142
00:15:49,905 --> 00:15:53,323
A beautiful day
to make pizza to taste

143
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:56,534
And they call it bella notte

144
00:15:59,202 --> 00:16:01,495
Well, buongiorno, Butch!

145
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:04,037
You wanna your breakfast, eh?

146
00:16:04,204 --> 00:16:08,040
Okay. The boss-a, he's-a save-a
some-a nice-a bones-a for you.

147
00:16:09,207 --> 00:16:12,126
Breakfast a-comin' up
from-a left field.

148
00:16:13,001 --> 00:16:14,836
Good-a catch!

149
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:22,548
Whoa, boy. Whoa.

150
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:01,236
Hey. Psst. Psst.

151
00:17:02,487 --> 00:17:06,823
- Blimey! Look, Peg. It's the Tramp.
- Shh.

152
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:09,699
Hiya, handsome.
Come to join the party?

153
00:17:09,866 --> 00:17:13,577
All right, all right. No time
for wisecracks. I've gotta get you out.

154
00:17:13,744 --> 00:17:16,995
I'm tellin' ya, the pressure's
really hot. Signs all over town.

155
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:20,872
- Gee, thanks.
- You're a bit of all right, chum.

156
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,082
- Okay, okay, get going.
- Hey, what's goin' on over there?

157
00:17:24,249 --> 00:17:27,460
Scram! And be careful.

158
00:17:28,877 --> 00:17:32,004
What? You mangy mutt.
Hey, let go. Let go of me!

159
00:17:52,389 --> 00:17:55,934
Well, Snob Hill. Ha.

160
00:17:58,435 --> 00:18:00,895
Hi, gals.
How's pickin's?

161
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,271
Pretty slim, eh?

162
00:18:04,438 --> 00:18:08,190
Yeah, I'll bet they've got a lid
on every trash can.

163
00:18:08,315 --> 00:18:11,943
Uh-oh. And a fence around every tree.

164
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:18,196
I wonder what the leash and collar set
does for excitement.

165
00:18:25,492 --> 00:18:26,367
Lassie! Lassie!

166
00:18:26,492 --> 00:18:30,703
Oh, Miss Lady, ma'am!

167
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:35,539
Miss Lady!

168
00:18:35,664 --> 00:18:37,541
Ah, good mornin', lassie.

169
00:18:37,665 --> 00:18:42,417
'Tis a bonny, braw, bright day,
uh, today.

170
00:18:42,584 --> 00:18:46,711
Why, Miss Lady,
is, uh, somethin' wrong?

171
00:18:46,837 --> 00:18:50,047
Aye, tell us, lassie.
If somebody's been mistreatin' ya...

172
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:54,883
Oh, no, Jock.
It's something I've done, I guess.

173
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,592
You?

174
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:59,261
It must be.
Jim Dear and Darling...

175
00:18:59,427 --> 00:19:01,762
are acting so...

176
00:19:05,764 --> 00:19:10,433
- Jim Dear and Darling?
- Hush, man!

177
00:19:19,063 --> 00:19:23,399
- Now, lassie, get on with the details.
- Well.

178
00:19:23,566 --> 00:19:27,526
I first noticed it the other day
when Jim Dear came home.

179
00:19:38,991 --> 00:19:41,075
Down, Lady. Down!

180
00:19:45,411 --> 00:19:49,581
Darling? Darling, are you all right?

181
00:19:49,706 --> 00:19:52,623
Of course I am.
Why shouldn't I be?

182
00:19:57,126 --> 00:19:59,836
Well, I just can't help worrying.
After all...

183
00:20:00,003 --> 00:20:04,464
in your condition,
alone here all day, walking that dog.

184
00:20:05,755 --> 00:20:08,632
- "That dog"?
- "That dog"?

185
00:20:09,467 --> 00:20:11,301
He's never called me that before.

186
00:20:11,468 --> 00:20:15,928
Well, now, lassie, I wouldn't
a-worry my wee head about that.

187
00:20:16,053 --> 00:20:18,930
Remember, they're only humans after all.

188
00:20:19,055 --> 00:20:20,973
That's right, Miss Lady.

189
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:26,100
Uh, as my grand pappy, Old Reliable,
used to say, um...

190
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,311
Don't recollect if I've ever mentioned
Old Reliable before.

191
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:33,104
Aye, you have, laddie,
uh, frequently.

192
00:20:33,229 --> 00:20:35,105
Oh, yeah.

193
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,398
But now Darling is...

194
00:20:37,523 --> 00:20:41,276
Well, we've always enjoyed
our afternoon romp together.

195
00:20:41,401 --> 00:20:43,277
But yesterday...

196
00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:01,621
No, Lady. No walk today.

197
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:15,003
No, Lady. Not now.

198
00:21:17,296 --> 00:21:20,672
Lady! Drop that, Lady!

199
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,216
Drop it, I say!

200
00:21:25,008 --> 00:21:27,301
It didn't hurt really.

201
00:21:27,468 --> 00:21:30,678
But Darling has never struck me before.

202
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:36,807
Now, lassie, do not take it
too seriously.

203
00:21:36,932 --> 00:21:38,974
After all, at a time like this...

204
00:21:39,141 --> 00:21:42,477
Why, yes.
You see, Miss Lady...

205
00:21:42,644 --> 00:21:47,813
there comes a time in the life
of all humans when, uh...

206
00:21:47,938 --> 00:21:53,483
Well, as they put it, uh,
the birds and the bees.

207
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:56,984
Or, well, uh, the stork.

208
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:59,319
You know? Uh, no?

209
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:00,862
Well, then, uh...

210
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,030
What he's trying to say, lassie, is...

211
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:06,949
Darling is expecting
a wee bairn.

212
00:22:07,074 --> 00:22:10,534
- Bairn?
- He means a baby, Miss Lady.

213
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:15,120
Oh. What's a baby?

214
00:22:15,245 --> 00:22:18,205
Well, they, they resemble humans.

215
00:22:18,372 --> 00:22:23,250
- But I'd say a mite smaller.
- Aye. And they walk on all fours.

216
00:22:23,417 --> 00:22:27,752
And if I remember correctly,
they "beller" a lot.

217
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,920
Aye. And they're very expensive.

218
00:22:31,087 --> 00:22:33,171
You'll not be permitted to play with it.

219
00:22:33,296 --> 00:22:35,673
But they're mighty sweet.

220
00:22:35,798 --> 00:22:38,508
And very, very soft.

221
00:22:38,633 --> 00:22:40,884
Just a cute little bundle...

222
00:22:41,926 --> 00:22:43,010
of trouble.

223
00:22:43,177 --> 00:22:45,846
Yeah. They scratch, pinch,
pull ears.

224
00:22:46,012 --> 00:22:49,389
Aw, but, shucks,
any dog can take that.

225
00:22:49,556 --> 00:22:51,598
It's what they do to your happy home.

226
00:22:51,765 --> 00:22:52,766
Move it over, will ya, friend?

227
00:22:53,015 --> 00:22:54,767
Home wreckers, that's what they are.

228
00:22:54,934 --> 00:22:57,060
Look here, laddie!
Who are you to barge in?

229
00:22:57,227 --> 00:22:59,687
The voice of experience, buster.

230
00:23:01,062 --> 00:23:04,064
Why, just wait till junior gets here.

231
00:23:04,231 --> 00:23:07,858
You get the urge for
a nice, comfortable scratch and...

232
00:23:07,983 --> 00:23:11,234
"Put that dog out!
He'll get fleas all over the baby."

233
00:23:11,401 --> 00:23:14,528
You start barking
at some strange mutt.

234
00:23:16,237 --> 00:23:18,572
"Stop that racket!
You'll wake the baby."

235
00:23:18,739 --> 00:23:23,867
And then, then they hit you
in the room and board department.

236
00:23:24,992 --> 00:23:28,536
Remember those nice, juicy cuts of beef?

237
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,912
Forget 'em.

238
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:34,372
Leftover baby food.

239
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:36,874
And that nice, warm bed by the fire?

240
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:45,253
A leaky doghouse.

241
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,546
- Oh, dear!
- Do not listen, lassie.

242
00:23:47,671 --> 00:23:51,674
- No human is that cruel.
- Of course not, Miss Lady.

243
00:23:51,798 --> 00:23:56,384
Why, everybody knows
a dog's best friend...

244
00:23:56,551 --> 00:23:58,386
is his human.

245
00:23:59,595 --> 00:24:01,971
Oh, come on now, fellas.

246
00:24:02,138 --> 00:24:04,473
Oh, you haven't fallen
for that old line now, have ya?

247
00:24:04,639 --> 00:24:09,726
Aye, and we've no need for mongrels
and their radical ideas.

248
00:24:09,892 --> 00:24:12,435
- Off with ya, now!
Off with ya! Off with ya!
- Okay, Sandy.

249
00:24:12,602 --> 00:24:13,936
- The name's Jock.
- Okay, Jock.

250
00:24:14,103 --> 00:24:18,064
- Heather Lad O' Glencairn to you!
- Okay, okay, okay!

251
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,565
But remember this, pigeon.
A human heart...

252
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:23,566
has only so much room
for love and affection.

253
00:24:23,691 --> 00:24:26,360
When a baby moves in...

254
00:24:26,485 --> 00:24:28,944
the dog moves out.

255
00:24:35,281 --> 00:24:38,283
Now, let's see.
That'll be about...

256
00:24:39,992 --> 00:24:41,868
Oh, well.

257
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:51,624
Darling?
There isn't any way we can tell...

258
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:54,459
for sure what it's going to be,
is there?

259
00:24:54,542 --> 00:24:55,918
I'm afraid not.

260
00:24:56,043 --> 00:24:58,836
Nobody ever knows for certain.

261
00:24:59,003 --> 00:25:01,672
All we can do is hope.

262
00:25:27,477 --> 00:25:30,980
Darling, are you sure
you want watermelon?

263
00:25:31,145 --> 00:25:35,315
Mm-hmm. Oh, and some chop suey, too.

264
00:25:35,482 --> 00:25:38,024
Chop suey?

265
00:25:38,191 --> 00:25:40,151
Oh, all right, darling.

266
00:25:52,157 --> 00:25:53,992
That darling booty.

267
00:25:54,158 --> 00:25:56,618
- And that bonnet!
- Isn't it just too adorable!

268
00:25:56,743 --> 00:26:00,329
- Don't you just love showers?
- Darling, I've never seen you
look more beautiful.

269
00:26:00,496 --> 00:26:02,871
- Isn't she absolutely radiant?
- Radiant?

270
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:05,206
Why, that's just what I told Bill
yesterday. "Bill," I said...

271
00:26:05,373 --> 00:26:07,457
Darling looks radiant.
Positively radiant."

272
00:26:07,582 --> 00:26:11,335
"Why, in all my days," I said,
"I've never seen anyone
as radiant as Darling."

273
00:26:14,004 --> 00:26:17,380
- Oh, Jim, you look terrible.
- Jim, absolutely horrible.

274
00:26:17,547 --> 00:26:19,631
I never saw you look worse.

275
00:26:19,798 --> 00:26:23,758
Cheer up, Jim. Old Doc Jones
has never lost a father yet.

276
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:38,892
Yes, Aunt Sarah, it's boy!
Uh-huh, a boy! And he...

277
00:26:39,767 --> 00:26:42,519
What's that? Eyes?

278
00:26:42,686 --> 00:26:44,645
Oh, what color are they? Wh...

279
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,897
Oh, gosh! I-I-I forgot to look.

280
00:26:48,063 --> 00:26:51,190
A boy! It's a boy!
It's a... Doctor!

281
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,068
- Doctor, it's a boy.
- Yes. Yes, I know.

282
00:26:56,235 --> 00:26:59,820
Uh-huh, a boy.
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

283
00:26:59,987 --> 00:27:01,488
It's a boy! It's a boy! It's a boy!

284
00:27:01,654 --> 00:27:05,449
Hello? Hello, Jim?
Are, are you there, Jim?

285
00:27:05,574 --> 00:27:08,658
Central? Central, we've been cut off.
Hello.

286
00:27:08,825 --> 00:27:11,410
Hello? Hello? Hello?

287
00:27:40,676 --> 00:27:42,510
What is a baby?

288
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:47,180
I just can't understand.

289
00:27:48,306 --> 00:27:52,433
It must be something wonderful

290
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,768
It must be something grand

291
00:27:57,436 --> 00:28:00,854
'Cause everybody's smiling

292
00:28:01,021 --> 00:28:05,649
In a kind and wistful way

293
00:28:05,774 --> 00:28:10,193
And they haven't even noticed

294
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:14,320
That I'm around today

295
00:28:25,952 --> 00:28:28,536
What is a baby, anyway?

296
00:28:30,788 --> 00:28:34,206
Oh, what is a baby

297
00:28:34,373 --> 00:28:37,041
I must find out today

298
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:41,544
What makes Jim Dear and Darling

299
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:46,672
Act this way

300
00:29:01,305 --> 00:29:05,266
Oh, my little star sweeper

301
00:29:06,641 --> 00:29:10,476
I'll sweep the stardust

302
00:29:10,643 --> 00:29:12,478
For you

303
00:29:18,982 --> 00:29:23,693
Little soft fluffy sleeper

304
00:29:23,818 --> 00:29:28,153
Here comes a pink cloud

305
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,737
For you

306
00:29:37,284 --> 00:29:42,077
Little wandering angel

307
00:29:42,202 --> 00:29:45,663
Fold up your wings

308
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:48,789
Close your eyes

309
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,379
And may love be your keeper

310
00:30:13,387 --> 00:30:18,347
There now, little star sweeper,
dream on.

311
00:30:32,355 --> 00:30:35,149
Well, that should do it.

312
00:30:35,316 --> 00:30:38,151
There's enough here
to take us halfway to China.

313
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,362
Darling? Darling?

314
00:30:45,529 --> 00:30:47,448
We haven't much time.

315
00:30:47,614 --> 00:30:50,115
Jim, I just can't leave him.

316
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:53,951
- He's still so small and helpless.
- He'll be all right.

317
00:30:54,076 --> 00:30:56,952
Now, come on.
If he wakes up, we'll never get away.

318
00:30:58,412 --> 00:31:00,288
But, Jim, I feel so guilty
deserting him like this.

319
00:31:00,413 --> 00:31:02,206
Oh, nonsense.

320
00:31:04,415 --> 00:31:07,125
Hey! What's the matter with Lady?

321
00:31:07,292 --> 00:31:10,710
Oh, she thinks we're running out on him.

322
00:31:10,877 --> 00:31:15,046
Aw, don't worry, old girl.
We'll be back in a few days.

323
00:31:15,213 --> 00:31:18,798
- And Aunt Sarah will be here.
- And with you here to help her...

324
00:31:18,924 --> 00:31:20,841
Well, there's the old girl now.

325
00:31:22,342 --> 00:31:24,635
Coming, Aunt Sarah! Coming!

326
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:27,804
Sorry I'm late, dears.
Hope I haven't kept you waiting.

327
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,471
- Here, let me take your things.
- Now, now, now, now, no fussing.

328
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,223
I know my way around.

329
00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:34,474
On your way, now.
Mustn't miss your train.

330
00:31:34,641 --> 00:31:37,226
Have a good time,
and don't worry about a thing.

331
00:31:37,391 --> 00:31:39,477
Goodbye, dears.
Goodbye, goodbye.

332
00:31:39,601 --> 00:31:41,686
Goodbye.

333
00:31:41,852 --> 00:31:44,979
Now to see that big nephew of mine.

334
00:31:53,567 --> 00:31:58,487
Coochie, coochie, coochie.
Oh, you adorable lit...

335
00:31:58,654 --> 00:32:02,823
Good gracious! What are you doing here?
Go on, now. Shoo, shoo! Scat!

336
00:32:02,989 --> 00:32:04,657
Get out of here.

337
00:32:04,782 --> 00:32:06,741
Oh, there, there.

338
00:32:06,908 --> 00:32:10,828
Aunt Sarah won't let that dog
frighten you anymore.

339
00:32:10,953 --> 00:32:13,829
No, no, no, no, no.

340
00:32:15,955 --> 00:32:18,665
Rock-a-bye, baby

341
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:21,542
On the treetop

342
00:32:21,708 --> 00:32:24,001
When the wind blows

343
00:32:55,227 --> 00:32:59,020
We are Siamese
if you please

344
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:04,816
We are Siamese
if you don't please

345
00:33:06,108 --> 00:33:11,278
Now we looking over
our new domicile

346
00:33:11,445 --> 00:33:15,280
If we like we stay
for may be quite a while

347
00:33:27,787 --> 00:33:31,706
Do you seeing that thing
swimming round and round?

348
00:33:31,831 --> 00:33:33,206
Yes.

349
00:33:33,331 --> 00:33:37,125
Maybe we could reaching in
and make it drown.

350
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:42,420
If we sneaking up
upon it carefully...

351
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:48,215
there will be a head for you,
a tail for me.

352
00:34:10,895 --> 00:34:13,395
Do you hear what I hear?

353
00:34:14,605 --> 00:34:16,814
A baby cry.

354
00:34:16,981 --> 00:34:20,399
Where we finding baby
there are milk nearby.

355
00:34:21,817 --> 00:34:25,569
If we lookin baby buggy
there could be

356
00:34:26,903 --> 00:34:30,989
Plenty milk for you
and also some for me

357
00:34:41,369 --> 00:34:45,413
What's going on down there?
Oh, merciful heavens!

358
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:48,916
My darlings!
My precious pets!

359
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:52,918
Oh. Oh, that wicked animal.

360
00:34:53,043 --> 00:34:57,754
Attacking my poor, innocent
little angels.

361
00:35:02,131 --> 00:35:05,549
Good afternoon, ma'am.
What can I do for you?

362
00:35:05,674 --> 00:35:08,259
I want a muzzle.
A good, strong muzzle.

363
00:35:08,426 --> 00:35:11,929
Uh, yes, ma'am.
Now, here's our latest.

364
00:35:12,053 --> 00:35:16,514
Combination leash and muzzle. Now,
we'll just slip it on like this, and...

365
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:20,308
No. No, no, no, no.
Nice doggy. No, no, don't wiggle.

366
00:35:20,475 --> 00:35:23,434
Uh, steady now.
Now, now, now.

367
00:35:23,601 --> 00:35:26,019
- Careful, you little...
- Watch out!

368
00:35:26,186 --> 00:35:28,687
- Doggy! Careful, doggy!
- Come back.

369
00:35:28,854 --> 00:35:31,606
Come back here, I say!
Come back here.

370
00:37:08,076 --> 00:37:11,037
Hey, Pige, what are you doing
on this side of the tracks?

371
00:37:11,203 --> 00:37:13,872
I thought you... Wha...

372
00:37:14,038 --> 00:37:17,457
Ah, you poor kid.

373
00:37:17,582 --> 00:37:19,499
Oh, we've gotta get this off.

374
00:37:21,542 --> 00:37:25,045
I think I know the very place.

375
00:37:25,211 --> 00:37:27,046
Come on.

376
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,715
Well, here we are.

377
00:37:32,548 --> 00:37:34,382
- The zoo?
- Sure!

378
00:37:36,468 --> 00:37:39,719
No, no. This way.
Follow me.

379
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,351
- Oh!
- What's the matter, Pige?

380
00:37:51,517 --> 00:37:54,019
- We can't go in?
- Why not?

381
00:37:54,186 --> 00:37:57,103
- Well, the sign says...
- Yeah, well, well that's...

382
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:59,355
- That's the angle.
- Angle?

383
00:37:59,521 --> 00:38:01,439
Look, we'll just wait for the right...

384
00:38:02,398 --> 00:38:04,858
Uh-oh. Here we are now.

385
00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:07,193
Just lay low.

386
00:38:16,657 --> 00:38:17,657
Hey, you!

387
00:38:17,782 --> 00:38:20,784
Uh, I beg your pardon.
Were you addressing me?

388
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:24,869
- What's the matter? Can't you read?
- Why, yes. Several languages.

389
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:27,579
Oh, a wise guy, eh?

390
00:38:27,746 --> 00:38:30,289
All right, now,
what's this creature doin' here?

391
00:38:31,456 --> 00:38:34,041
- He's not my dog.
- Oh, he's not, eh?

392
00:38:34,208 --> 00:38:37,418
Go away. Go on.
Why, certainly not, Officer.

393
00:38:37,585 --> 00:38:41,379
Aye, I suppose you'll be tellin' me next
it was the dog that was whistlin', eh?

394
00:38:41,545 --> 00:38:45,130
- I-I'm certain I don't know.
- Oh, I'm a liar now, am I?

395
00:38:45,297 --> 00:38:49,341
Well, you listen to me!
Aha! Resistin' an officer of the law.

396
00:38:49,466 --> 00:38:51,884
You're gonna pay! Oh!

397
00:38:52,009 --> 00:38:55,470
Pull a knife on me, will ya?
Tryin' to assassinate me, are ya?

398
00:38:55,637 --> 00:38:58,221
Carryin' a concealed weapon!

399
00:39:05,517 --> 00:39:08,560
Come on, Pige.
The place is ours.

400
00:39:14,563 --> 00:39:17,065
We'd better go through this place
from A to Z.

401
00:39:18,649 --> 00:39:19,733
Apes.

402
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:24,945
No, no, no. No use even asking them.
They wouldn't understand.

403
00:39:25,111 --> 00:39:27,320
- They wouldn't?
- Uh-uh.

404
00:39:27,487 --> 00:39:30,614
Too closely related to humans.
Uh-oh!

405
00:39:30,781 --> 00:39:33,825
Alligators! Now, there's an idea!

406
00:39:33,992 --> 00:39:37,285
Say, Al, do you suppose your could nip
this contraption off for us?

407
00:39:37,451 --> 00:39:39,953
Glad to oblige.

408
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,079
Whoa! Whoa!

409
00:39:52,002 --> 00:39:54,961
Hmph. If anybody ever needed
a muzzle, it's him.

410
00:39:55,128 --> 00:39:56,962
Timber!

411
00:39:57,129 --> 00:39:59,297
Hey, Pigeon, look out!

412
00:40:00,381 --> 00:40:04,174
What harebrained idiot would...
Hey, look. A beaver!

413
00:40:07,343 --> 00:40:09,428
Here's the answer to our problem.

414
00:40:09,595 --> 00:40:11,721
Let me see here.

415
00:40:12,971 --> 00:40:16,098
Six foot six
and seven-sixteenth inches.

416
00:40:16,223 --> 00:40:19,891
Pardon me, friend.
I wonder if you'd do us a little...

417
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:24,060
Busy, sonny, busy.
Can't stop to gossip now.

418
00:40:24,185 --> 00:40:27,938
Gotta slide this sycamore
to the swamp.

419
00:40:28,105 --> 00:40:29,939
This will only take a second
of your time.

420
00:40:30,106 --> 00:40:32,608
Only a second?
L-Listen, listen, sonny.

421
00:40:32,733 --> 00:40:34,650
Do you realize every second...

422
00:40:34,817 --> 00:40:38,319
70 centimeters of water
is wasted over that spillway?

423
00:40:38,485 --> 00:40:41,863
- Yeah, but...
- Gotta get this log movin', sonny.

424
00:40:42,029 --> 00:40:46,324
Gotta get it movin'.
'T ain't the cuttin' takes the time.

425
00:40:46,489 --> 00:40:48,991
It's the doggone haulin'!

426
00:40:50,701 --> 00:40:52,785
The haulin'. Exactly!

427
00:40:52,952 --> 00:40:56,454
- Now, what you need is...
- Better bisect this section here.

428
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:59,372
What you need is a log puller.

429
00:40:59,539 --> 00:41:02,290
I said, a log puller!

430
00:41:03,958 --> 00:41:06,043
I ain't "deaf", sonny.

431
00:41:06,209 --> 00:41:09,210
There's no need to...
Did you say, "log puller"?

432
00:41:10,211 --> 00:41:13,214
And, by a lucky coincidence,
you see before you...

433
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,215
modeled by the lovely little lady...

434
00:41:15,381 --> 00:41:18,424
the new, improved, patented,
handy-dandy...

435
00:41:18,549 --> 00:41:20,800
never-fail, little-giant log puller!

436
00:41:20,926 --> 00:41:22,885
The busy beaver's friend.

437
00:41:23,052 --> 00:41:24,345
You don't say!

438
00:41:24,511 --> 00:41:26,638
Guaranteed not to wear, tear,
rip or ravel.

439
00:41:26,804 --> 00:41:28,972
Turn around, sister,
and show the customer the merchandise.

440
00:41:29,139 --> 00:41:32,641
And it cuts log hauling time
66 percent!

441
00:41:33,558 --> 00:41:35,976
Sixty-six percent, eh?

442
00:41:36,935 --> 00:41:39,394
Think of that!
Well, how's it work?

443
00:41:39,561 --> 00:41:45,148
Why, it's no work at all.
You merely slip this ring over
the limb like this, and haul it off.

444
00:41:45,314 --> 00:41:49,150
Say, you mind
if I slip it on for size?

445
00:41:49,317 --> 00:41:51,151
Help yourself, friend.
Help yourself.

446
00:41:51,318 --> 00:41:54,319
Okay, don't mind if I do.

447
00:41:55,612 --> 00:41:58,155
How do you get
the "consarned" thing off, sonny?

448
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,156
Glad you brought that up, friend.
Glad you brought that up.

449
00:42:01,281 --> 00:42:04,325
To remove it, simply place the strap
between your teeth.

450
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:06,159
Like this?

451
00:42:06,284 --> 00:42:09,495
Correct, friend.
Now, bite hard!

452
00:42:10,245 --> 00:42:11,996
You see?

453
00:42:12,121 --> 00:42:13,497
It's off!

454
00:42:13,622 --> 00:42:16,165
Say, that is simple.

455
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:19,375
Well, friend,
we'll be on our way now, so...

456
00:42:19,542 --> 00:42:22,544
Not so fast now, sonny.

457
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:25,212
I'll have to make certain
it's satisfactory...

458
00:42:25,379 --> 00:42:27,838
before we settle on a price.

459
00:42:27,964 --> 00:42:30,839
Oh, no, it's all yours, friend.
You can keep it!

460
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:34,217
Uh, I can, huh? I can?

461
00:42:34,384 --> 00:42:36,844
Uh-huh. It's a free sample.

462
00:42:38,219 --> 00:42:43,597
Well, thanks a lot!
Thanks ever so...

463
00:43:00,439 --> 00:43:04,733
Say, it works swell!

464
00:43:08,403 --> 00:43:10,696
But when she put
that horrible muzzle on me...

465
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:15,198
Oh, say no more. I get the
whole picture. Aunts, cats, muzzles.

466
00:43:15,323 --> 00:43:19,033
Well, that's what comes
of tying yourself down to one family.

467
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,327
- Haven't you a family?
- One for every day of the week.

468
00:43:22,451 --> 00:43:25,245
The point is,
none of them have me.

469
00:43:25,412 --> 00:43:27,913
I'm afraid I don't understand.

470
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:32,374
It's simple. You see...
Hey!

471
00:43:34,375 --> 00:43:38,919
Something tells me it's supper-time.
Come on. I'll show you what I mean.

472
00:43:41,421 --> 00:43:43,922
Now take the Schultzes here.
Little Fritzie...

473
00:43:44,089 --> 00:43:47,382
That's me, Pige.
Makes this his Monday home.

474
00:43:47,507 --> 00:43:48,717
Monday home?

475
00:43:48,842 --> 00:43:53,720
Ach, ja! Mondays is Mama Schultz
cooking der wiener schnitzel.

476
00:43:55,637 --> 00:43:57,054
Delicious!

477
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,764
Now, O'Briens here
is where little Mike...

478
00:43:59,931 --> 00:44:03,558
Sure and that's me again, Pige.
Comes of a Tuesday.

479
00:44:03,683 --> 00:44:05,059
Of a Tuesday?

480
00:44:05,185 --> 00:44:10,061
Begorra and that's when they're after
havin' that darlin' corn beef.

481
00:44:10,187 --> 00:44:14,564
You see, Pige, when you're
footloose and collar-free...

482
00:44:14,689 --> 00:44:17,524
ah, you take nothing but the best.

483
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,068
Hey, Tony's!

484
00:44:21,193 --> 00:44:26,404
Of course. The very place
for a very special occasion.

485
00:44:27,946 --> 00:44:31,365
No, this way, Pige.
I have my own private entrance.

486
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:38,161
Wait here.

487
00:44:40,621 --> 00:44:43,664
Just-a one-a minute.
I'm a-comin'. I'm a...

488
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:46,665
What's-a matter? Somebody's a-makin'
the April fool with...

489
00:44:48,458 --> 00:44:50,626
Oh, hello, Butch!

490
00:44:50,793 --> 00:44:54,629
Where you been-a so long?
Hey, Joe, look who's here.

491
00:44:54,796 --> 00:44:57,838
Well, what do ya know?
It's-a Butch-a.

492
00:44:58,005 --> 00:45:00,131
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Joe.

493
00:45:00,298 --> 00:45:03,926
Joe, bring-a some bones for Butch-a
before he eat-a me up.

494
00:45:04,091 --> 00:45:07,177
Okay, Tony. Okay.
Bones a-comin' up-a.

495
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,848
What's this?

496
00:45:16,015 --> 00:45:19,934
Hey, Joe! Look-a.
Butch, he's got a new girlfriend.

497
00:45:20,059 --> 00:45:24,603
Well, a-son of a gun!
He's-a got a cocker Spanish a-girl.

498
00:45:25,771 --> 00:45:28,648
Hey, she's pretty sweet kiddo, Butch.

499
00:45:28,815 --> 00:45:33,525
You take-a Tony's advice
and a-settle down with this-a one, eh?

500
00:45:35,026 --> 00:45:38,111
- "This-a one"?
- This-a one. This-a one. Oh!

501
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:43,114
Tony, you know, he's-a not-a
speak-a English a-pretty good.

502
00:45:44,823 --> 00:45:47,491
Now, first-a we fix-a the table.

503
00:45:47,574 --> 00:45:49,118
Here's your bones, a-Tony.

504
00:45:49,283 --> 00:45:51,618
Okay, bones... Bones!

505
00:45:51,785 --> 00:45:54,954
What's the matter for you, Joe?
I break-a your face-a.

506
00:45:55,121 --> 00:45:58,330
Tonight, Butch-a,
he's a-get a-best in-a house!

507
00:45:58,497 --> 00:46:00,040
Okay, Tony. You the boss.

508
00:46:00,207 --> 00:46:01,958
Now, tell me,
what's your pleasure?

509
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:04,459
A la carte? Dinner?

510
00:46:06,377 --> 00:46:09,711
Aha! Okay. Hey, Joe.

511
00:46:09,878 --> 00:46:14,714
Butch-a, he says he wants-a
two spaghetti especialle.

512
00:46:14,881 --> 00:46:16,841
Heavy on-a meats-a-ball-a.

513
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:18,842
Tony, dogs a-don't a-talk.

514
00:46:19,008 --> 00:46:22,302
- He's a-talkin' to me!
- Okay, he's a-talkin' to you.

515
00:46:22,469 --> 00:46:24,720
You the boss! Mamma mia!

516
00:46:27,805 --> 00:46:32,474
Now, here you are-a,
the best-a spaghetti in-a town.

517
00:46:48,066 --> 00:46:51,652
For this is the night

518
00:46:51,819 --> 00:46:55,195
It's a beautiful night

519
00:46:55,362 --> 00:47:00,699
And we call it bella notte

520
00:47:01,782 --> 00:47:05,160
Look at the skies

521
00:47:05,326 --> 00:47:08,995
They have stars in their eyes

522
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:14,331
On this lovely bella notte

523
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:18,667
Side by side

524
00:47:18,792 --> 00:47:21,753
With your loved one

525
00:47:21,918 --> 00:47:27,589
You'll find enchantment here

526
00:47:29,214 --> 00:47:33,759
The night will weave its magic spell

527
00:47:33,925 --> 00:47:39,387
When the one you love is near

528
00:47:39,554 --> 00:47:45,057
For this is the night

529
00:47:45,223 --> 00:47:49,768
And the heavens are right

530
00:47:49,934 --> 00:47:52,686
On this lovely

531
00:47:52,853 --> 00:47:57,939
Bella notte

532
00:48:05,068 --> 00:48:08,570
This is the night

533
00:48:08,737 --> 00:48:12,781
It's a beautiful night

534
00:48:12,947 --> 00:48:15,074
And we call it

535
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:19,868
Bella notte

536
00:48:21,035 --> 00:48:24,204
Look at the skies

537
00:48:24,371 --> 00:48:28,373
They have stars in their eyes

538
00:48:28,539 --> 00:48:30,916
On this lovely

539
00:48:31,083 --> 00:48:35,835
Bella notte

540
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:42,589
Side by side
with your loved one

541
00:48:42,756 --> 00:48:48,175
You'll find enchantment here

542
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:54,720
The night will weave its magic spell

543
00:48:54,887 --> 00:48:59,932
When the one you love is near

544
00:49:00,099 --> 00:49:05,435
For this is the night

545
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:11,063
And the heavens are right

546
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:14,107
On this lovely

547
00:49:14,273 --> 00:49:19,402
Bella notte

548
00:49:38,286 --> 00:49:40,496
Oh! Oh, dear.

549
00:49:42,247 --> 00:49:45,165
- Is something wrong, Pige?
- It's morning.

550
00:49:45,332 --> 00:49:49,334
Yeah. So it is.

551
00:49:49,501 --> 00:49:51,460
I should've been home hours ago.

552
00:49:51,627 --> 00:49:57,006
Why? Because you still believe in that
"ever faithful old dog trey" routine?

553
00:49:58,172 --> 00:50:03,342
- Ah, come on, Pige. Open up your eyes.
- Open my eyes?

554
00:50:03,509 --> 00:50:07,678
To what a dog's life can really be.
Show ya what I mean.

555
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:13,473
Look down there.
Tell me what you see.

556
00:50:16,516 --> 00:50:21,436
Well, I see nice homes
with yards and fences...

557
00:50:21,561 --> 00:50:26,188
Exactly. Life on a leash.
Look again, Pige.

558
00:50:28,857 --> 00:50:33,484
Look, there's a great big hunk of world
down there with no fence around it...

559
00:50:33,651 --> 00:50:36,777
where two dogs can find
adventure and excitement...

560
00:50:36,902 --> 00:50:38,778
and beyond those distant hills...

561
00:50:38,903 --> 00:50:42,698
who knows what wonderful experiences.

562
00:50:42,865 --> 00:50:46,033
And it's all ours for the taking, Pige.

563
00:50:46,199 --> 00:50:48,284
It's all ours.

564
00:50:49,618 --> 00:50:51,286
It sounds wonderful.

565
00:50:52,286 --> 00:50:54,454
But?

566
00:50:54,621 --> 00:50:56,456
But who'd watch over the baby?

567
00:51:02,751 --> 00:51:04,209
You win.

568
00:51:04,376 --> 00:51:07,337
Come on. I'll take ya home.

569
00:51:23,845 --> 00:51:25,972
It's a beautiful night

570
00:51:26,138 --> 00:51:29,515
And they call it bella...

571
00:51:32,059 --> 00:51:36,311
Not to change the subject,
but, uh, ever chase chickens?

572
00:51:36,478 --> 00:51:40,563
- I should say not.
- Oh, ho. Then you've never lived!

573
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:45,816
- But we shouldn't.
- I know. That's what makes it fun.

574
00:51:45,942 --> 00:51:50,027
Aw, come on, kid.
Start building some memories.

575
00:51:52,195 --> 00:51:54,196
But we, we won't hurt the chickens?

576
00:51:54,363 --> 00:51:58,073
Hurt 'em? No.
We'll just stir 'em up a bit.

577
00:52:05,577 --> 00:52:10,413
Just look at those fat, lazy biddies.
They should have been up hours ago.

578
00:52:22,586 --> 00:52:24,672
Some fun, eh, kid?

579
00:52:24,796 --> 00:52:28,006
Hey, what's goin' on in there?

580
00:52:28,173 --> 00:52:30,174
- What's that?
- That's the signal to get going.

581
00:52:30,299 --> 00:52:32,175
Come on!

582
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:39,721
- This is living, eh, kid?
- Is it?

583
00:52:40,555 --> 00:52:43,139
Come on, Pige, follow me.

584
00:52:53,396 --> 00:52:58,399
You know, there's a little bit of bird
dog in all of us, eh, Pige? Pige? Pige?

585
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,234
Pige? Where are ya, Pige?

586
00:53:03,568 --> 00:53:05,403
Pige?

587
00:53:06,736 --> 00:53:08,571
Pigeon?

588
00:53:10,071 --> 00:53:11,906
Oh, Pige!

589
00:54:54,713 --> 00:54:57,006
Hey, hey, Dachsie, how we comin'?

590
00:54:57,173 --> 00:54:59,299
Just one more chorus and we're out.

591
00:54:59,466 --> 00:55:01,634
Okay, on a downbeat.

592
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,177
One, two...

593
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:15,225
Put her in number four, Bill,
while I check her license number.

594
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:17,226
Okay.

595
00:55:18,519 --> 00:55:20,895
All right, baby, in here.

596
00:55:22,354 --> 00:55:26,481
Well, well, look youse guys,
Miss Park Avenue herself.

597
00:55:26,648 --> 00:55:30,650
Blimey, a regular
bloomin' "debutante".

598
00:55:30,816 --> 00:55:33,235
Yeah, and pipe the crown jewel
she's wearin'.

599
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,736
Yeah. What ya in for, sweetheart?

600
00:55:35,861 --> 00:55:38,988
Puttin' fleas on the butler?

601
00:55:44,366 --> 00:55:47,576
All right, all right, you guys.
Lay off, will ya?

602
00:55:47,701 --> 00:55:49,661
Ah, what's the matter, Peg?

603
00:55:49,828 --> 00:55:53,371
We was only havin' a bit of sport,
we was.

604
00:55:53,538 --> 00:55:56,414
Well, can't you see the poor kid's
scared enough already?

605
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:59,666
Pay no attention,
my little "orchechornya".

606
00:55:59,833 --> 00:56:03,293
That's right, dearie.
They don't mean no real harm.

607
00:56:03,418 --> 00:56:06,087
Is like Gorky says in lower Dapts.

608
00:56:06,212 --> 00:56:10,880
Quote: "Miserable being must find
more miserable being.

609
00:56:11,047 --> 00:56:13,966
Then is happy." Unquote.

610
00:56:14,132 --> 00:56:16,092
Boris is a philosopher.

611
00:56:16,217 --> 00:56:19,969
Besides, little "bublichki,"
wearing license here...

612
00:56:20,094 --> 00:56:23,137
that is like waving,
you should excuse the expression...

613
00:56:23,304 --> 00:56:25,347
red flag in front of bull.

614
00:56:25,514 --> 00:56:28,849
My license?
But what's wrong with it?

615
00:56:29,015 --> 00:56:30,934
There ain't nothin' wrong with it,
dearie.

616
00:56:31,059 --> 00:56:36,728
Confidential. Is not one dog here
would not give left hind leg
for such a knick-knack.

617
00:56:36,895 --> 00:56:40,147
That's your passport to freedom,
honey. Without it...

618
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:43,732
Hey. Hey, hey, youse guys, look.

619
00:56:43,899 --> 00:56:46,818
Poor Nutsy is takin' the long walk.

620
00:56:49,861 --> 00:56:54,697
- Where is he taking him?
- Through the one-way door, sister.

621
00:57:00,575 --> 00:57:03,702
You, you mean he's...

622
00:57:08,371 --> 00:57:12,457
Oh, oh, well, a short life
and a merry one.

623
00:57:12,582 --> 00:57:15,041
Yep, that's what the Tramp always says.

624
00:57:15,208 --> 00:57:18,585
- The Tramp?
- There now, there's a bloke
what never gets caught.

625
00:57:18,751 --> 00:57:21,628
He's given the slip
to every dog catcher in this burg.

626
00:57:21,753 --> 00:57:25,839
You won't believe this, dearie,
but no matter how tight a jam he's in...

627
00:57:26,006 --> 00:57:28,591
that Tramp always finds some way out.

628
00:57:28,757 --> 00:57:30,925
I can quite easily believe that.

629
00:57:31,092 --> 00:57:35,845
Ah, but remember, my friends,
even Tramp has his Achilles heel.

630
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:39,388
Pardon me, amigo,
what is this "chili heel"?

631
00:57:39,555 --> 00:57:41,556
Achilles heel, Pedro.

632
00:57:41,723 --> 00:57:44,516
This is meaning his, uh, weaknesses.

633
00:57:44,641 --> 00:57:47,518
Oh, oh, the dames! Yeah!

634
00:57:48,602 --> 00:57:52,021
He has an eye
for a well-turned paw, he has.

635
00:57:52,146 --> 00:57:54,022
Let's see. There's been Lulu.

636
00:57:54,147 --> 00:57:55,522
Yeah, and Trixie.

637
00:57:55,647 --> 00:57:57,023
Und Fifi.

638
00:57:57,148 --> 00:58:02,234
And my sister, Rosita Chiquita
Juanita Chihuahua, I think.

639
00:58:02,485 --> 00:58:03,943
What a dog!

640
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:06,570
Yeah! Tell us about it, Peg.

641
00:58:06,737 --> 00:58:09,238
What a dog!

642
00:58:09,405 --> 00:58:12,282
Peg used to be
in the Dog and Pony Follies.

643
00:58:12,449 --> 00:58:17,076
He's a tramp
but they love him

644
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:21,621
Breaks a new heart everyday

645
00:58:21,788 --> 00:58:25,956
He's a tramp
They adore him

646
00:58:26,123 --> 00:58:30,209
And I only hope
he'll stay that way

647
00:58:30,375 --> 00:58:33,044
He's a tramp

648
00:58:33,126 --> 00:58:35,253
He's a scoundrel

649
00:58:35,419 --> 00:58:37,588
He's a rounder

650
00:58:37,754 --> 00:58:39,714
He's a cad

651
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:42,091
He's a tramp

652
00:58:42,256 --> 00:58:44,383
But I love him

653
00:58:44,508 --> 00:58:47,927
Yes, even I have got it pretty bad

654
00:58:49,052 --> 00:58:53,430
You can never tell when he'll show up

655
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:58,808
He gives you plenty of trouble

656
00:58:58,974 --> 00:59:02,935
I guess he's just a no-count pup

657
00:59:03,102 --> 00:59:06,687
But I wish that he were double

658
00:59:06,813 --> 00:59:08,688
- He's a tramp
- Boom ba-boom, ruff

659
00:59:08,814 --> 00:59:11,357
- He's a rover
- Boom ba-boom, ruff

660
00:59:11,482 --> 00:59:15,359
- And there's nothing more to say
- Boom ba-boom, ruff

661
00:59:15,484 --> 00:59:19,528
If he's a tramp
He's a good one

662
00:59:19,653 --> 00:59:25,073
And I wish that I could travel his way

663
00:59:25,197 --> 00:59:29,409
Wish that I could travel his way

664
00:59:29,575 --> 00:59:34,953
Wish that I could travel his way

665
00:59:36,787 --> 00:59:39,539
Yeah, but he never takes 'em serious.

666
00:59:39,664 --> 00:59:45,167
Ah, but some day
he is meeting someone different...

667
00:59:45,334 --> 00:59:48,001
some delicate, fragile creature...

668
00:59:48,168 --> 00:59:51,546
who is giving him a wish
to shelter and protect.

669
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:55,089
Like Miss Park Avenue here,
eh, matey?

670
00:59:55,256 --> 00:59:58,717
Mmm, could be.
But when he does...

671
00:59:58,842 --> 01:00:03,386
Yeah, I'm way ahead of ya.
Under the spell of true love...

672
01:00:03,511 --> 01:00:05,970
The poor chump grows careless.

673
01:00:06,137 --> 01:00:08,054
The Cossacks are picking him up.

674
01:00:08,179 --> 01:00:10,639
And it's curtains for the Tramp.

675
01:00:13,349 --> 01:00:16,309
It's the little cocker, Bill,
in number four.

676
01:00:16,476 --> 01:00:17,810
Okay.

677
01:00:19,519 --> 01:00:23,564
All right, baby,
they've come to take you home.

678
01:00:23,689 --> 01:00:26,565
You're too nice a girl
to be in this place.

679
01:00:37,321 --> 01:00:39,989
Courage, man. Courage.

680
01:00:40,072 --> 01:00:44,825
But I-I've never
even considered matrimony.

681
01:00:44,992 --> 01:00:49,119
Nor I, but no matter
which of us she accepts...

682
01:00:49,244 --> 01:00:51,787
we'll always be the best of friends.

683
01:00:53,205 --> 01:00:57,790
Now remember, not a word
about her unfortunate experience.

684
01:00:57,915 --> 01:01:01,168
- You don't want to hurt her feelings.
- Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

685
01:01:02,293 --> 01:01:03,878
Lassie.

686
01:01:04,045 --> 01:01:07,171
Miss Lady, ma'am.

687
01:01:07,337 --> 01:01:10,381
Please, I don't want to see anybody.

688
01:01:10,548 --> 01:01:14,550
Now, now, lassie,
Do not feel that way about it.

689
01:01:14,717 --> 01:01:17,385
Of course not, Miss Lady.

690
01:01:17,552 --> 01:01:21,971
Why, some of the finest people
I ever tracked down were jail birds.

691
01:01:22,138 --> 01:01:25,389
Quiet, you great loony!

692
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:28,558
Uh, please, lassie, uh, we've come...

693
01:01:28,725 --> 01:01:31,435
with a-a proposition for helping' ya.

694
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:33,853
Help me?
What do you mean?

695
01:01:34,019 --> 01:01:37,813
Well, now, you see, lassie...

696
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:40,523
neither of us is as young
as we used to be.

697
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:43,524
But we're still in the prime of life.

698
01:01:43,691 --> 01:01:48,361
Aye, and we've both got
very comfortable homes.

699
01:01:48,527 --> 01:01:50,195
That's right.

700
01:01:50,362 --> 01:01:54,530
Where we know you'll be welcome
and appreciated, Miss Lady.

701
01:01:54,697 --> 01:01:59,283
So, s-so to come directly
to the point...

702
01:01:59,408 --> 01:02:03,494
If you could, uh, find it possible...

703
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:06,454
to, uh, to, uh, to, uh...

704
01:02:06,579 --> 01:02:10,456
You're both very kind,
and I do appreciate it, but...

705
01:02:10,581 --> 01:02:14,167
Oh, Pigeon! Oh, Pige...

706
01:02:14,292 --> 01:02:16,710
Oh! Hi, boys.

707
01:02:19,878 --> 01:02:21,879
Anything new in the kennel club set?

708
01:02:26,423 --> 01:02:30,218
Little something I picked up
for ya, Pige.

709
01:02:38,347 --> 01:02:40,640
Looks like I'm the one
that's in the doghouse.

710
01:02:40,765 --> 01:02:45,226
If this person is annoyin' you,
Miss Lady...

711
01:02:45,393 --> 01:02:48,228
We'll gladly throw the rascal out!

712
01:02:48,395 --> 01:02:50,895
That won't be necessary.
Thank you.

713
01:02:51,062 --> 01:02:53,230
Very well, ma'am.

714
01:02:54,106 --> 01:02:57,857
You, you mongrel!

715
01:03:03,277 --> 01:03:07,154
Ah, come on, Pige.
I-It wasn't my fault.

716
01:03:09,406 --> 01:03:13,075
I thought you were right behind me.
Honest!

717
01:03:13,242 --> 01:03:15,410
- When I heard they'd taken you
to the pound...
- Oh!

718
01:03:15,576 --> 01:03:18,285
Don't even mention
that horrible place.

719
01:03:18,452 --> 01:03:22,372
I was so embarrassed
and, and frightened.

720
01:03:22,496 --> 01:03:24,540
Oh, now, now, now.

721
01:03:24,664 --> 01:03:28,292
Who could ever harm
a cute little trick like you?

722
01:03:28,458 --> 01:03:30,710
Trick? Trick!

723
01:03:30,835 --> 01:03:34,420
- That reminds me. Who is Trixie?
- Trixie?

724
01:03:34,586 --> 01:03:38,297
And Lulu? And Fifi? And Rosita Chiquita
w-w-whatever her name is?

725
01:03:38,463 --> 01:03:41,590
Chiquita ch-ch... Oh!
Oh, yes, well, I, I can explain...

726
01:03:41,757 --> 01:03:46,051
- As far as I'm concerned,
you needn't worry about your old heel.
- M-M-My heel?

727
01:03:46,176 --> 01:03:49,053
- I don't need you to shelter
and protect me.
- Yes, but, but, but...

728
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:53,347
If you grow careless, don't blame me.
And I don't care if the Cossacks
do pick up you.

729
01:03:53,472 --> 01:03:55,348
Goodbye!

730
01:03:55,473 --> 01:03:57,349
And take this with you!

731
01:05:04,678 --> 01:05:06,554
Stop that!

732
01:05:09,890 --> 01:05:12,099
Hush now! Hush!

733
01:05:15,643 --> 01:05:17,478
Stop that racket!

734
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:21,355
What's wrong, Pige?

735
01:05:21,521 --> 01:05:23,147
- A rat!
- Where?

736
01:05:23,314 --> 01:05:25,523
Upstairs, in the baby's room.

737
01:05:25,690 --> 01:05:29,692
- How do I get in?
- The little door on the porch.

738
01:07:16,002 --> 01:07:18,587
Merciful heavens!

739
01:07:18,753 --> 01:07:22,672
Oh, you poor little darling.
Now, now, now, now, now.

740
01:07:22,797 --> 01:07:26,841
Thank goodness you're not hurt.
You, you vicious brutes!

741
01:07:26,966 --> 01:07:29,050
Back! Get back!

742
01:07:29,217 --> 01:07:33,261
Go, go on! Get back!
Now, the pound! The pound!

743
01:07:33,428 --> 01:07:35,846
That's it. I'll call the pound.

744
01:07:38,389 --> 01:07:40,098
Come here! Come here!

745
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:44,893
Come on, come on. Come along!
I'll call them this minute.

746
01:07:45,059 --> 01:07:47,436
Couldn't sleep a wink
with that brute in the house.

747
01:07:55,608 --> 01:07:57,984
Hello! Hello!

748
01:08:02,111 --> 01:08:05,321
I don't care if you are alone there,
young man.

749
01:08:05,446 --> 01:08:08,698
I insist you pick him up immediately.

750
01:08:16,243 --> 01:08:18,329
Darling, look!

751
01:08:20,163 --> 01:08:23,873
And if you want my advice,
you'll destroy that animal at once.

752
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:28,167
Don't worry, ma'am.
We've been after this one for months.

753
01:08:28,334 --> 01:08:30,585
We'll take care of him.

754
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:36,005
- Well, what do you suppose...
- Say, what's going on here?

755
01:08:36,172 --> 01:08:40,508
Just pickin' up a stray, mister.
Come on, get up!

756
01:08:40,633 --> 01:08:42,675
- Caught him attackin' a baby.
- Good heavens!

757
01:08:42,842 --> 01:08:44,009
- My baby!
- Aunt Sarah!

758
01:08:44,134 --> 01:08:45,676
Aunt Sarah! Aunt Sarah!

759
01:08:47,345 --> 01:08:49,179
- Aunt Sarah!
- Aunt Sarah!

760
01:08:50,804 --> 01:08:55,182
I was certain he was no good
the moment I first laid eyes on him.

761
01:08:55,307 --> 01:08:58,017
Yeah, but, uh...

762
01:08:58,184 --> 01:09:01,186
I never thought
he'd do a thing like that.

763
01:09:02,561 --> 01:09:05,021
Thank goodness I got there in time.
There they were, crib overturned...

764
01:09:05,188 --> 01:09:08,815
Oh, I'm sure there must be some mistake.
I know Lady wouldn't...

765
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:13,192
Watch out! That dog's loose!
Keep her away!

766
01:09:13,317 --> 01:09:15,693
Nonsense! She's trying
to tell us something.

767
01:09:16,945 --> 01:09:18,821
What is it, old girl?

768
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:23,198
What are you trying...
Darling, Aunt Sarah, come here.

769
01:09:23,365 --> 01:09:26,366
- What is it, Jim?
- Ah! A rat!

770
01:09:26,533 --> 01:09:28,201
A rat?

771
01:09:28,451 --> 01:09:30,160
We should've known.

772
01:09:30,285 --> 01:09:34,538
I misjudged him badly.

773
01:09:34,663 --> 01:09:38,039
Come on.
We got to stop that wagon.

774
01:09:38,206 --> 01:09:42,000
But, man, we do not know
which way they've gone.

775
01:09:42,125 --> 01:09:44,043
We'll track 'em down.

776
01:09:44,210 --> 01:09:49,003
- A-A-And then?
- We'll hold 'em, hold 'em at bay.

777
01:10:01,636 --> 01:10:06,013
- Now what?
- The scent. Follow the scent.

778
01:10:12,225 --> 01:10:14,059
Ach, let's face it, man.

779
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:18,728
We both know you've lost
your sense of smell.

780
01:11:24,307 --> 01:11:27,434
Go on! Get outtalk here!
Go on, you, get away!

781
01:11:33,896 --> 01:11:37,773
Go on, you, get away!
Watch it now. Watch it! Watch it!

782
01:11:51,530 --> 01:11:53,406
Hi, Pige.

783
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,634
All right, everybody,
watch the birdie.

784
01:12:38,099 --> 01:12:39,974
Steady now.

785
01:12:41,016 --> 01:12:42,851
Hold it.

786
01:12:45,811 --> 01:12:48,521
I guess I used a little too much.

787
01:12:49,355 --> 01:12:51,815
Uh-oh. Darling.

788
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:54,315
- Visitors.
- Visitors?

789
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,734
Why, it's Jock.

790
01:12:59,151 --> 01:13:00,985
And good old Trusty.

791
01:13:01,903 --> 01:13:04,321
Careful now, man. Careful.

792
01:13:04,446 --> 01:13:07,989
- It's a wee bit slippery.
- Yes, yes.

793
01:13:10,074 --> 01:13:12,575
All right, boy, we'll let 'em in.

794
01:13:14,035 --> 01:13:17,120
Oh, no, not you, young man.
You're going to take a nap.

795
01:13:17,245 --> 01:13:21,330
Well, Merry Christmas!
Come in! Come in!

796
01:13:21,455 --> 01:13:24,374
If you'll just step into the parlor,
I'll see about refreshments.

797
01:13:24,541 --> 01:13:27,835
Oh, darling, where did you put
the dog biscuits?

798
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:30,460
You know, the box Aunt Sarah
sent for Christmas.

799
01:13:30,585 --> 01:13:32,170
In the kitchen, Jim dear.

800
01:13:32,337 --> 01:13:37,214
Oh, no doubt about it.
They've got their mother's eyes.

801
01:13:39,341 --> 01:13:41,342
Aye.

802
01:13:43,593 --> 01:13:46,720
But there is a bit of their father
in 'em, too.

803
01:13:48,012 --> 01:13:51,848
Well, and I see
you finally acquired a collar.

804
01:13:52,015 --> 01:13:56,517
Oh, yes, complete with license.

805
01:13:56,684 --> 01:13:59,852
Oh, yeah, a new collar.

806
01:14:00,019 --> 01:14:02,687
Caught the scent the moment
I came in the house.

807
01:14:03,771 --> 01:14:09,107
"Trusty," I says, "Trusty,
somebody's wearin' a new collar."

808
01:14:10,275 --> 01:14:11,942
Of course, now...

809
01:14:12,109 --> 01:14:16,028
my sense of smell
is very highly developed.

810
01:14:16,194 --> 01:14:17,987
Runs in the family, you know.

811
01:14:18,112 --> 01:14:20,613
There'll be no livin' with him
from now on.

812
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:25,283
As my grand pappy, Old Reliable,
used to say...

813
01:14:25,450 --> 01:14:28,910
I don't recollect if I've ever
mentioned Old Reliable before.

814
01:14:29,910 --> 01:14:31,703
No, you haven't, Uncle Trusty.

815
01:14:32,746 --> 01:14:36,039
Huh? I haven't?

816
01:14:36,164 --> 01:14:41,417
Well, uh, as Old Reliable
used to say...

817
01:14:41,584 --> 01:14:46,211
He'd say, uh, uh...
He'd say, uh, uh...

818
01:14:50,964 --> 01:14:53,507
Dog gone.

819
01:14:53,632 --> 01:14:59,385
You know, I-I clean forgot
what it was he used to say.

820
01:15:04,472 --> 01:15:09,058
Peace, my children

821
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:14,144
Of good will

822
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:17,687
Peace, my children

823
01:15:17,812 --> 01:15:19,772
Peace

824
01:15:19,938 --> 01:15:25,567
Be still
