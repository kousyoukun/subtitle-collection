小心地守護著
You'll need it about this time

13
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:06,810
當你沉迷愛中
To keep from falling like a star

14
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:11,400
不要讓愛像流星墜落
When you make that dizzy climb

15
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:16,650
今夜
For this is the night

26
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:10,040
雪花在夜里輕輕飄下
Silent as a snowflake in the night

27
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:15,000
圣潔的夜

哦  親愛的吉姆
Oh, Jim, dear.

41
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,480
你知道我想要什么  對不對  
It's the one I was admiring, isn't it?

42
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,480
有蝴蝶結  
Trimmed with ribbons?

43
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:21,400
是有蝴蝶結
Well, it has a ribbon.

44
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,830
好可愛
Oh, how sweet.

00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,490

00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,920
可愛的小狗狗
What a perfectly beautiful little lady.

47
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,470
來  麗滴  過來
Come on, Lady. Over here.

48
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,140
乖
That's a girl.

49
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:57,480
來  這是你的小床
There, now. A nice little bed for you.

50
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:00,780
迪爾  她睡這里不會著涼嗎  
But Jim, dear, are you sure she'll be warm enough?

51
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:05,280
當然不會  她會在這個溫暖的小窩  
Why, of course, darling. She'll be snug as a bug in a... uh-oh.

52
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,240
差點忘了
Almost forgot something.

53
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,240
來
There.

54
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,660
麗滴  晚安
Good night, Lady.

55
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,500
達玲  別擔心
Now, now, don't worry, darling.

56
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,420
她一會就睡著了
She'll go right to sleep.

57
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,000
不  麗滴
No, no, Lady.

58
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:24,930
你的床在這里
This is where you belong, right here.

59
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:45,860
你看  她很寂寞的
Aw, look. She's lonesome.

60
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,950
也許我們  今晚就好了  
Don't you think maybe...? Just for tonight?

61
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,990
達玲  一開始就訓練
Now, darling, if we're going to show her who's master,

62
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,290
她才會聽話
we must be firm from the very beginning.

63
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,370
麗滴
Lady!

64
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,700
別叫了
Stop that now!

65
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,290
別叫
Stop it!

66
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:55,520
麗滴  安靜  聽到沒  
Lady! Quiet, now. You hear me?

67
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,270
上床去
Back to bed!

68
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,190
快
Quick, now.

69
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,770
別再吵
Not one more sound.

70
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,170
吉姆
Jim, dear.

71
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,300
-吉姆  -怎么啦  
-Aw, Jim. -Hm? What?

72
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,810
好吧
Oh, all right.

73
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,690
記住  下不為例
But remember, just for tonight.

74
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:10,150
好  麗滴
All right, Lady. All right.

75
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,030
麗滴  我起來了
I'm up. I'm up, Lady. I...

76
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,530
哦  不
Oh, no!

77
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,280
吉姆  怎么啦  
What's wrong, Jim? What is it?

78
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:20,240
你可不可以告訴她  今天是星期天  
Can't you explain to Lady about Sundays?

79
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,650
{\an8}慘案發生

80
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:35,570
達玲  你有沒有發現  有了麗滴之后
Have you noticed, darling, since we've had Lady,

81
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,410
我們就很少看  讓人心煩的頭條新聞了  
we see less and less of those disturbing headlines?

82
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:43,660
對  要是沒有她  日子該怎么過  
Yes, I just don't know how we ever got along without her.

83
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:47,290
她有六個月大了吧
Say, she must be about six months old.

84
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,380
我們最好趕快幫她辦戶口
We'd better be getting her a licence.

85
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,890
希望大小剛剛好
Hope it fits.

86
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,600
真漂亮
My, but it does look nice.

87
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,060
女大十八變
So grown up.

88
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,860
加克和查弟  一定會大吃一驚的
Won't Jock and Trusty be surprised?

89
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,090
往前四步  再左轉
Four steps straight and then to the left

90
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:37,010
就到了我的秘密基地
And right to the place where I marked it

91
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:41,050
后院里有我藏的寶貝
With a bonnie, bonnie bone that I buried for me own

92
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,220
后院里有我藏的寶貝
In my bonnie, bonnie bank in the backyard

93
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,980
哇  太棒了
That's a grand sight.

94
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,270
加克
Jock!

95
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,980
加克
Oh, Jock!

96
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,450
嗨  加克
Hello, Jock.

97
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:04,410
哦  是你啊  小美人
Oh! Oh, it's you, lassie.

98
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,540
看得出來我哪里不一樣嗎  
Notice anything different?

99
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,750
你洗了澡  
Eh... You've had a bath?

100
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,420
不對
No, not that.

101
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,960
你修了指甲  
You've had your nails clipped?

102
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:16,880
再猜
Guess again.

103
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,800
我猜不出來
Well, I wouldn't a-be a-knowing.

104
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,600
哇  小美人
Why, lassie.

105
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,640
新項圈
A bonnie new collar.

106
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:30,020
-喜歡嗎  -喜歡
-Do you like it? -Aye.

107
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:34,270
一定很貴
Hm... It must be very expensive.

108
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,480
-查弟看過沒  -還沒
-Have you shown it to Trusty yet? -No.

109
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:40,190
我們趕快去找他
We'd best go at once.

110
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,610
他對這種事很敏感
You know how sensitive he is about these things.

111
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,510
他在做夢
He's dreaming.

112
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,760
對
Aye.

113
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:09,180
夢見他跟他爺爺
Dreamin' of those bonnie bygone days

114
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:12,480
千辛萬苦在沼澤里
when he and his grandfather were trackin' criminals

115
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,140
追蹤壞人的英勇往事
through the swamps.

116
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:17,150
-真的嗎  -但那是  
-They were? -But that was before...

117
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,730
是怎樣  
Before what?

118
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,280
小美人  該告訴你實話了
'Tis time you knew the truth, lassie.

119
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:26,070
這種事不該發生在狗身上
It shouldn't have happened to a dog.

120
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,780
但是  
But, well...

121
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:32,160
查弟失去了嗅覺
Trusty has lost his sense of smell.

122
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,790
-不會吧  -真的
-No! -Aye.

123
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,250
小美人我們不能告訴他
But we must never let on that we know, lassie.

124
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,090
他一定會非常傷心的
It would break his poor heart.

125
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,980
他跑哪去了  他跑哪去了  
Which way did he go? Which way did he go?

126
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:56,060
-誰  -一個大家伙
-Go? -Yeah, big fella.

127
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,860
差不多有六尺兩寸
About, uh, six-foot-two.

128
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,440
不  三寸
No, uh, three.

129
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:03,360
穿條紋裝  沒戴項圈
Wore a striped suit. No collar. Uh...

130
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,660
哇  麗滴小姐
Why, Miss Lady.

131
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,870
你戴項圈了
You have a collar.

132
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,540
還有身份證
And a licence.

133
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,500
我的天
My, my.

134
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,830
-光陰似箭  -對
-How time does fly. -Aye.

135
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,740
她拿迪爾的拖鞋磨牙
It seems only yesterday she was cuttin' her teeth

136
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,250
好像才是昨天的事
on Jim Dear's slippers,

137
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:26,510
現在她已經亭亭玉立了
and now there she is, a full-grown lady.

138
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:31,140
戴著榮譽勛章
wearing the greatest honour man can bestow.

139
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,770
代表忠誠與地位
The badge of faith and respectability.

140
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,690
對  麗滴小姐
That's right, Miss Lady.

141
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,860
就像我爺爺以前常說  
As my grandpappy, Old Reliable, used to say...

142
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,530
我有沒有提過我爺爺
I don't recollect if I've ever mentioned Old Reliable before.

143
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,950
有
Aye, you have, laddie.

144
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,950
對哦
Oh, yeah.

145
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,990
是吉姆迪爾
Ooh! It's Jim Dear.

146
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,410
失陪了
Please excuse me.

00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,920
麗滴  你在這里
Hello, there, Lady.

148
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,500
來  看誰先到家
Come on, beat you home.

149
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,720
你又贏了
Oh... You win again.

150
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,100
站好
Steady, now.

151
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,020
別動
Steady.

152
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,640
這是什么  
Well, what have we here? Oh...

153
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,190
長大了對不對  
Big girl now, huh?

154
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,360
好
All right.

155
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,110
女士優先
Oh. Ladies first.

156
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,950
達玲  有麗滴陪我們
You know, darling, with Lady here,

157
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,740
人生就沒有遺憾了
I'd say life is quite complete.

158
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,080
是啊  迪爾
Yes, dear.

159
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:40,000
沒有什么能取代  她在我們心中的地位
I don't imagine anything could ever take her place in our hearts.

160
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,750
真舒服
What a day!

161
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,050

一個禮拜沒來了
I haven't been there in a week.

175
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,760
這樣的好天氣  正適合做比薩
A beautiful day to make pizza

176
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:17,100
嘿  我們還是叫它  愛的夜晚
Hey, still we call it bella notte

177
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:21,930
是長云
Well, buon giorno, Butch.

178
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,480
你要來吃早餐嗎  
You want-a your breakfast, eh?

179

準備到左半場接球
Breakfast coming up from a-left field.

181
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,780
接得好
Good catch!

182
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,660
慢點  小子
Whoa, boy, whoa.

183
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,890

00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,170
-佩姬  是長云  -噓
-Look, Peg, it's the tramp. -Shh!

191
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:30,170
嗨  帥哥  一起來狂歡吧  
Hiya, handsome. Come to join the party?

192
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,460
好了  沒時間耍嘴皮
All right, all right. No time for wisecracks.

193
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,050
我先救你們出來
I've got to get you out.

194
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,470
情況不妙  到處都是警示
I'm telling you, the pressure's really on. Signs all over town.

195
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,350
-謝啦  -你真好
-Gee, thanks. -You're a bit of all right, chum.

196
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:44,430

-OK, OK, get going. -Hey! What's going on over there?

197
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,440
快走  小心點
Scram. And be careful.

198
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,440
你這只臟狗
Why, you mangy mutt.

199
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:53,150
放開  放開我
Hey. Let go. Let go of me. Ah!

200
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:15,880
有錢人的地盤
Well. Snob hill! Ha.

201
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:21,220
嗨  女孩們  你們好嗎  
Hi, gals. How's pickings?

202
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,770
不太好  
Pretty slim, eh?

203
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:28,690
對  我相信  每個垃圾桶都有蓋子
Yeah. I'll bet they've got a lid on every trash can.

204
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,560
連樹都有籬笆圈住
And a fence around every tree.

205
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:38,780
天知道那些栓皮帶  戴項圈的家伙有什么樂趣
I wonder what the leash and collar set does for excitement.

206
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,160
小美女
Lassie. Lassie!

207
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:51,330
麗滴小姐
Oh, Miss Lady, ma'am.

208
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:56,000
麗滴小姐
Miss Lady!

209
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,010
早安  小美女
Ah! Good morning, lassie.

210
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,380
今天天氣  
'Tis a bonnie, braw, bright day... Eh...

211
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,800
真好啊
...day.

212
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,220
麗滴小姐
Why, Miss Lady.

213
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,180
怎么啦  
Is something wrong?

214
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,890
對  小美女  告訴我們
Aye. Tell us, lassie.

215
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:12,310
-如果有人欺負你  -不  加克
-If somebody's been mistreatin' ya... -Oh, no, Jock.

216
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,600
我一定做錯了什么
It's something I've done, I guess.

217
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,110
你  
You?

218
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,780
一定是
It must be.

219
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:22,410
吉姆迪爾和達玲對我好  
Jim Dear and Darling are acting so...

220
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:30,580
-吉姆迪爾和達玲  -閉嘴
-Jim Dear and Darling? -Hush, lad.

221
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:43,090
小美女  說清楚一點
Now, lassie, get on with the details.

222
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,640
首先我注意到
Well, I first noticed it

223
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,930
有一天吉姆迪爾回家時
the other day when Jim Dear came home.

224
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:00,690
麗滴  不要
Down, Lady, down!

225
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,830
達玲  達玲
Darling, darling!

226
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,410
你還好吧  
Are you all right?

227
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:12,080
我當然好  怎么會不好  
Of course I am. Why shouldn't I be?

228
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,670
我就是放心不下
I just can't help worrying.

229
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,670
以你現在的情況
After all, in your condition,

230
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,090
一個人在家
alone here all day,

231
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,430
還要蹓那只狗
and walking that dog...

232
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,180
-那只狗  -那只狗  
-That dog! -That dog?

233
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,850
他從來沒有這樣叫過我
He's never called me that before.

234
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,810
小美女
Well, now, lassie,

235
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,440
別太多心了
I wouldn't worry my wee head about that.

236
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,440
記住  他們畢竟是人
Remember, they're only humans, after all.

237
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,900
對  麗滴小姐
That's right, Miss Lady.

238
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:46,070
就像我爺爺以前常說  
As my grandpappy, Old Reliable, used to say...

239
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,870
我有沒有提過我爺爺
I don't recollect if I've ever mentioned Old Reliable before.

240
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,830
有
Aye, you have, laddie.

241
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,670
-講過八百遍了  -對
-Uh, frequently. -Oh, yeah.

242
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:58,500
但現在達玲  
But now Darling is... Well...

243
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:02,010
我們每天下午  都會一起玩
We've always enjoyed our afternoon romp together.

244
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,420
但是昨天  
But yesterday...

245
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:22,280
不  麗滴  今天不去散步
No, Lady. No walk today.

246
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,910
不  麗滴
No, Lady.

247
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,710
現在不行
Not now.

248
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,920
麗滴
Lady!

249
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,920
麗滴  放下
Drop that, Lady.

250
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,590
我說放下
Drop it, I say.

251
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,800
其實不會痛
It didn't hurt, really.

252
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:51,390
但是達玲從來沒打過我  
But Darling has never struck me... before.

253
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,140
小美女
Now, lassie.

254
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,350
別放在心上
Do not take it too seriously.

255
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,560
畢竟這種事  
After all, at a time like this...

256
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:03,020
麗滴小姐  你看
Why, yes, you see, Miss Lady,

257
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:08,240
人類一生中都會發生  
there comes a time in the life of all humans when, uh...

258
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,620
他們說是  
Well, as they put it, uh...

259
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,080
那件事嗎  
Birds and the bees?

260
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,450
或是  怎么說  
Or... Well, uh...

261
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,920
送子鳥  不是  
The stork? You know... Uh, no?

262
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,040
-嗯  小美女  -他的意思是
-Well, uh... -What he's trying to say, lassie,

263
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:26,760
達玲要生孩子了
is Darling is expecting a wee bairn.

264
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,090
孩子  
Bairn?

265
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,140
麗滴小姐  他是說小寶寶
He means a baby, Miss Lady.

266
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,890
哦
Oh.

267
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,720
什么是小寶寶  
What's a baby?

268
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:38,730
是人
Well, they resemble humans.

269
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:42,020
但很小
But I'd say a mite smaller.

270
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,110
對  用爬的
Aye. And they walk on all fours.

271
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,360
如果我記得沒錯  他們叫起來很大聲
And if I remember correctly, they bellow a lot.

272
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:51,160
對  而且很花錢
Aye. And they're very expensive.

273
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,660
你不能跟他們玩
You will not be permitted to play with it.

274
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,240
但他們很可愛
But they're mighty sweet.

275
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:59,120
軟綿綿的
And very, very soft.

276
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:01,500
只是可愛的
Just a cute little bundle.

277
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,630
小麻煩
Of trouble.

278
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,880
對  他們亂抓亂捏  拉耳朵  
Yeah. They scratch, pinch, pull ears...

279
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,880
沒什么了  每只狗都受得了
Ah, but shucks. Any dog can take that.

280
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:12,140
他們就是這樣  破壞你甜蜜的家
It's what they do to your happy home.

281
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,680
閃一邊好嗎  
Move it over, will you, friend?

282
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,560
他們是破壞狂
Homewreckers, that's what they are.

283
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,680
你是誰  憑什么闖進來  
Look here. Who are you to barge in?

284
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:21,600
小子  我是過來人
The voice of experience, buster.

285
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:24,690
等到小孩生下來
Just wait till junior gets here.

286
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,400
當你很想有人幫你抓癢
You get the urge for a nice comfortable scratch,

287
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:29,820
就有人會說  "把狗弄出去
and... "Put that dog out!

288
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,990
他會把跳蚤傳給小寶寶"
He'll get fleas all over the baby."

289
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,820
你朝陌生狗大叫
You start barking at some strange mutt.

290
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:39,330
"別叫了  小寶寶會被你吵醒"
"Stop that racket. You'll wake the baby."

291
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,160
然后
And then!

292
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:44,580
他們把你打入冷宮
Then they hit you in the room and board department.

293
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:48,800
記得那些大魚大肉嗎  
Remember those nice, juicy cuts of beef?

294
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,430
想都別想
Forget them.

295
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:55,050
吃寶寶吃剩的吧
Leftover baby food.

296
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:58,970
還有爐火旁  那張溫暖的床嗎  
And that nice, warm bed by the fire?

297
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,770
變成漏水的狗屋
A leaky doghouse.

298
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,020
-老天  小美女  -別聽他胡說
-Oh, dear. -Do not listen, lassie.

299
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,820
沒有人會那么殘忍
No human is that cruel.

300
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,360
麗滴小姐  當然不會
Of course not, Miss Lady.

301
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,910
大家都知道
Why, everybody knows

302
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:18,280
人類是狗最好的朋友
a dog's best friend is his human.

303
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,250
拜托
Oh, come on now, fellas.

304
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:25,040
你還沒上過當是嗎  
Oh, you haven't fallen for that old line, now have you?

305
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:28,090
對  你這個混混
Aye. And we've no need for mongrels

306
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,380
別在這里胡說八道
and their radical ideas.

307
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,540
走開
Off with you, now. Off with you!

308
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:34,040
-好  小家伙  -我叫加克
-OK, Sandy. -The name's Jock.

309
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,650
-好  加克  -快滾
-OK, Jock. -Heather Lad of Glencairn to you!

310
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:38,400
好  好  好
OK, OK, OK.

311
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:40,560
但是記住
But remember this, Pigeon.

312
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,310
人類的愛是有限的
A human heart has only so much room for love and affection.

313
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,980
當小寶寶降臨
When a baby moves in,

314
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,730
狗就一邊涼快吧
the dog moves out.

315
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,820

{\an8}耶魯

324
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:14,970
我們不知道  是男孩還是女孩對不對  
There isn't any way we can tell, for sure, what it's going to be, is there?

325
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:18,850
不知道  沒有人說得準
I'm afraid not. Nobody ever knows for certain.

326
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,260

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,170
達玲  你真的要吃西瓜  
Darling, are you sure you want watermelon?

332
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,010
還要一些牛雜
Oh! And some chop suey too.

333
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,720
牛  
Chop su...

334
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,850

{\an8}二月

336
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,690
{\an8}天使就要降臨

337
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,270
沒見過這么可愛的
That's the cutest thing I ever saw.

338
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,690
這些小鞋子
What darling little booties!

339
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:17,280
-那頂帽子  -好可愛啊
-That bonnet. -Isn't it just too adorable?

340
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,110
誰不喜歡這樣的聚會  
Don't you love showers?

341
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,450
你真是美極了
I've never seen you look more beautiful.

342
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,950
容光煥發
Isn't she radiant?

343
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,500
我昨天就是這樣告訴比爾的
That's what I told Bill yesterday.

344
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,130
我說  "比爾  認識達玲以來
"Darling looks positively radiant.

345
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:30,690
從來沒見過她這么容光煥發"
Why, in all my days," I said, "I've never seen anyone as radiant."

346
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,380
吉姆  你怎么這副德性
Jim, you look terrible.

347
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,130
太可怕
Absolutely horrible.

348
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,430
你糟透了
I never saw you look worse.

349
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:44,180
吉姆  打起精神  你撐得過去的
Cheer up, Jim. Old Doc Jones has never lost a father yet.

350
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,060

吉姆  你在嗎

364
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,600
總機  我們的電話被切斷了

我真搞不懂
I just can't understand

369
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:13,100
它一定很奇妙
It must be something wonderful

370
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:16,810
很不尋常
It must be something grand

371
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:21,610
不然大家為什么
'Cause everybody's smiling

372
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:26,450
都笑得那么開心
In a kind and wistful way

甚至都沒
And they haven't even noticed

374

吉姆  我真的舍不得
Jim, I just can't leave him.

405
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,910
他還這么小  需要人照顧
He's still so small and helpless.

406
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,740
他會沒事的

嘿  麗滴怎么啦

-Let me take your things. -No, no, no, no.

420

別客氣  這里我熟得很
No fussing. I know my way around.

421
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,320
走吧  不然就趕不上火車了
On your way. Mustn't miss your train.

老天  你在這里干嘛  
Good gracious! What are you doing here?

走開  下去
Go away. Get down.

494
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:58,460
快啊  警察先生  當然不是

Aye. I suppose you'll be telling me next

496
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:02,420
口哨是狗吹的吧  
it was the dog that was whistling, eh?

497
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,920
我真的不知道
I'm certain I don't know.

498
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:06,210
哦  那是我亂說了  
Oh! So I'm a liar now, am I?

499
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,090
你聽我說

違抗執勤人員
Ah-ha! Resisting an officer of the law.

501
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:12,890
可是要付出代價的

502

拿刀殺我啊

麗滴  走吧
Come on, Pige.

506
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,820
沒人會管我們了
The place is ours.

507
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:38,080
我們最好從頭找起
We'd better go through this place from A to Z.

508
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:40,870
猩猩
Apes.

509
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:46,000
不  問他們也沒用  他們不懂
No, no. No use even asking them. They wouldn't understand.

510
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:47,460
是嗎  
They wouldn't?

511
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:50,420
跟人類太像了
Uh-uh. Too closely related to humans.

512
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,840
{\an8}鱷魚

鱷魚  有了
Alligators. Now there's an idea.

514
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:58,530
你可以  幫我們把這個咬斷嗎  
Say, Al, do you suppose you could nip this contraption off for us?

水里
...swamp.

531
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:51,030
只耽誤你一秒鐘
Well, this will only take a second.

532
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:53,320
一秒鐘  聽著  小子
Only a second? Listen, sonny.

533
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:57,410
你知道每一秒  就有七十公分的水
Do you realise every second, 70 centimetres of water

534
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,490

要把這根木頭拖走
Gotta get it moving.

537
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:07,500
切斷很花時間

538

你需要的是拉木頭的工具
What you need is a log puller.

542

我說拉木頭的工具

543
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,150
小子  我不是聾子
I ain't deaf, sonny.

544
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:28,650
不用這樣  
There's no need to...

545
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,110
你剛說拉木頭的工具

555
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,550
太好了
Think of that.

00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,260
-要怎么用  -簡單得不得了
-Well, how's it work? -Why, it's no work at all.

557
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:04,980
只要把這個環  像這樣套在木頭上
You merely slip this ring over the limb like this

558
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,270
然后拉
and haul it off.

559
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,850
那  
Uh, say...

560
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,270
我試用一下如何  
You mind if I slip it on for size?

561
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,270
請便
Help yourself, friend.

562

小子  怎么拿下來  
How do you get the consarned thing off, sonny?

564
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:22,240
你問對了  你問對了
Glad you brought that up. Glad you brought that up.

565
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:25,450
只要把帶子  放在牙齒中間  
To remove it, simply place the strap between your teeth...

566
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,290
像這樣  
Like this?

567
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:30,630
對  然后用力咬

-天亮了  -對

我早該回家了
I should have been home hours ago.

693
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:18,320
為什么  你還相信那一套  那套"忠狗"歪理  
Why? Because you still believe in that "ever faithful old dog Tray" routine?

694
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:21,610
拜托
Aw, come on, Pige.

695
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:24,780
-眼睛擦亮一點  -眼睛擦亮一點

看看狗的世界可以多精彩

697
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:29,410
跟我走你就知道

701
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:46,010
對  受拘束的生活
Exactly. Life on a leash.

702
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:47,760
再看看
Look again, Pige.

703
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:52,520
后面有個更大的世界
Look, there's a great big hunk of world down there

704
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:54,900
沒有籬笆圍住
with no fence around it.

705
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:58,400
我們可以去冒險  追求刺激

706
00:50:58,570 --> 00:51:00,190
看看更遠的地方

707
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:04,200
誰知道還有什么奇妙的事

708
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:06,830
都等著我們去追尋
And it's all ours for the taking, Pige.

709
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:09,240
都是我們的
It's all ours.

710
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,750
聽起來很棒
It sounds wonderful.

711
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:14,710
但是  
But?

712
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:18,040
但是小寶寶怎么辦  
But who'd watch over the baby?

713
00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:25,720
你贏了
You win.

714
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:27,100
來吧
Come on.

715
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:29,180
我送你回家
I'll take you home.

716
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,840
{\an8}捕狗隊

717
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:47,160
今夜真美妙
It's a beautiful night

718
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:51,160
我們叫它  
And they call it...

719
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:56,120
不是要改變話題  但是  
Not to change the subject, but, um...

720
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:57,790
你追過雞沒有  
Ever chase chickens?

721
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,460
沒有
I should say not!

722
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:02,090
那你白活了
Oh, ho! Then you've never lived.

723
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:04,260
-這樣做不對  -我知道
-But we shouldn't. -I know.

724
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:06,260
所以才好玩啊
That's what makes it fun.

725
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:09,510
來吧
Aw, come on, kid.

726
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,640
留下些美好的回憶
Start building some memories.

727
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,690
但是  不會傷到雞吧  
But we... We won't hurt the chickens?

728
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:17,350
傷到雞  不會
Hurt them? No!

729
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,690
只是攪和一下
We'll just stir them up a bit.

730
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:29,740
看他們一個個又肥又懶
Just look at those fat, lazy biddies.

731
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:32,040
他們早該起床了
Why, they should've been up hours ago.

732
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,970
好玩吧  
Some fun, hey, kid?

733
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:48,470
嘿  怎么回事  
Hey, what's going on in there?

734
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,180
怎么啦  
What's that?

735
00:52:50,350 --> 00:52:52,350
該開溜了  走吧
That's the signal to get going. Come on.

736
00:52:58,230 --> 00:53:01,360
-人生就是要這樣  -是嗎  
-This is living, hey, kid! -Is it?

737
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:04,280
來吧  跟我走
Come on, Pige. Follow me.

738
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:18,790
我們都有點打獵的本能
You know, there's a little bit of bird dog in all of us, eh, Pige?

739
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,040
麗滴  麗滴  
Pige? Pige?

740
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,880
麗滴  你在哪  
Pige? Where are you, Pige?

741
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:26,340
麗滴  
Pige?

742
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:29,340
麗滴  
Pigeon?

743
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,720
哦  麗滴
Oh, Pige!

744
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:45,340
{\an8}捕狗隊

745
00:55:16,370 --> 00:55:18,660
嘿  大西  進行得怎么樣  
Hey. Hey, Dachsie, how we coming?

746
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:20,910
再唱一段就好了
Just one more chorus and we're out.

747
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:23,250
好  第一拍開始
OK. On a downbeat.

748
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:26,920
一  二  
One, two...

749
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:35,340
比爾  把她關到四號籠子
Put her in number four, Bill,

750
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:39,010
-我來檢查她的身份  -好
-while I check her licence number. -OK.

751
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,100
好  寶貝  進去
All right, baby, in here.

752
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:48,110
各位  來了個大小姐
Well, look yous guys, Miss Park Avenue herself.

753
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:49,570
老天
Blimey.

754
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:52,240
真是如花似玉
A regular bloomin' debutante.

755
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,860
還穿金戴銀呢
Yeah. And pipe the crown jewel she's wearing.

756
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:57,200
嘿  里面放心上人照片  
Hey, whatcha in for, sweetheart?

757
00:55:57,370 --> 00:56:00,620
還是收集跳蚤  
Putting fleas on the butler?

758
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,210
好  大伙兒  走開好嗎  
All right, you guys. Lay off, will you?

759
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:11,300
佩姬  怎么啦  
Aw, what's the matter, Peg?

760
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:15,010
我們只是開開玩笑
We was only having a bit of sport, we was.

761
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:17,930
你們看不出來  她嚇得半死嗎  
Can't you see the poor kid's scared enough already?

762
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:21,390
小姑娘  別理他們
Pay no attention, my little ochichernye.

763
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:22,930
沒錯
That's right, dearie.

764
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:24,930
他們沒有惡意
They don't mean no real harm.

765
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:28,520
這就是所謂的  
It's like Gorky says in Lower Depths, quote:

766
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:32,400
"幸災樂禍"
"Miserable being must find more miserable being.

767
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:34,610
這樣他們就開心了
Then he's happy."

768
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:37,740
-說完了  -包子真是有學問
-Unquote. -Boris is a philosopher.

769
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:39,570
但是話說回來  小姐
Besides, little bublichki,

770
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:41,330
在這種地方戴項圈
wearing licence here,

771
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:44,790
原諒我這么說  就是
that is like waving, you should excuse the expression,

772
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,040
自討苦吃
red flag in front of bull.

773
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:50,330
我的項圈怎么啦  
My licence? But what's wrong with it?

774
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,590
親愛的  沒什么
There ain't nothin' wrong with it.

775
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:55,260
偷偷告訴你  這里每一只狗
Confidential, there's not one dog here

776
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:58,430
會不惜犧牲一切  弄一個那樣的項圈
who would not give left hind leg for such a knick-knack.

777
00:56:58,590 --> 00:57:01,520
親愛的  那是自由通行證  少了它  
That's your passport to freedom, honey. Without it...

778
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:04,920
嘿  你們看
Hey. Hey, yous guys, look.

779
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:08,230
可憐的諾西被帶走了
Poor Nutsy is takin' the long walk.

780
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,900
他們要帶他去哪里  
Where is he taking him?

781
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:16,110
好妹妹  有去無回的路
Through the one-way door, sister.

782
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:22,020
{\an8}不準進入

783
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:25,240
你是說  他  
You... You mean he's...

784
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:32,080
唉
Oh, well.

785
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:34,130
人生苦短  好好享受
A short life and a merry one.

786
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:36,760
對  長云的名言
Yeah, that's what the Tramp always says.

787
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,800
-長云  -那個家伙
-The Tramp? -Now there's a bloke

788
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:40,300
從來沒被抓過
what never gets caught.

789
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:43,300
城里每個捕狗隊員  都拿他沒輒
He's given the slip to every dogcatcher in this burg.

790
00:57:43,470 --> 00:57:47,480
親愛的  你不會相信  不管被困在哪里
You won't believe this, dearie, but no matter how tight a jam he's in,

791
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:50,270
他總是有辦法逃出去
that Tramp always finds some way out.

792
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:52,610
我相信
I can quite easily believe that.

793
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:54,820
但記住  我的朋友
Ah, but remember, my friends,

794
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:57,530
長云也有他的弱點
even Tramp has his Achilles' heel.

795
00:57:57,690 --> 00:58:00,860
對不起  什么是"肉點"  
Pardon me, amigo. What is this "chilli heel"?

796
00:58:01,030 --> 00:58:03,240
是弱點
Achilles' heel, Pedro.

797
00:58:03,410 --> 00:58:06,200
就是致命傷
This is meaning his, uh... weaknesses.

798
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:09,210
對  女人
Oh. Oh, the dames. Yeah.

799
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:13,670
他喜歡漂亮的小妞
He has an eye for a well-turned paw, he has.

800
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,710
我看看  有露露
Let's see. There's been Lulu.

801
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,090
對  還有崔西
Yeah, and Trixie.

802
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:18,710
菲菲
Und Fifi.

803
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,130
還有我姐姐
And my sister,

804
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:22,680
露西塔
Rosita Chiquita Juanita Chihuahua.

805
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:23,930
應該沒錯
I think.

806
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:25,680
他真有一套
What a dog.

807
00:58:25,850 --> 00:58:28,310
對  佩姬  唱來聽吧
Yeah. Tell us about it, Peg.

808
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,940
他真有一套
What a dog!

809
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:33,980
佩姬以前在歌舞劇團表演
Peg used to be in the Dog and Pony Follies.

810
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:36,440
他就是長云
He's a tramp

811
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:38,730
大家都愛他
But they love him

812
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:42,610
每天都有新花招
Breaks a new heart every day

813
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:45,570
他就是長云
He's a tramp

814
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:47,660
大家都崇拜他
They adore him

815
00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:51,960
希望他永保風格
And I only hope he'll stay that way

816
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:54,670
他就是長云
He's a tramp

817
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,960
是惡棍
He's a scoundrel

818
00:58:57,130 --> 00:58:59,260
浪子
He's a rounder

819
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:01,510
壞胚子
He's a cad

820
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,720
他就是長云
He's a tramp

821
00:59:03,890 --> 00:59:06,050
可是我還是愛他
But I love him

822
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:09,640
即使他很壞
Yes, even I have got it pretty bad

823
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:13,350
你永遠不知道
You can never tell

824
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,480
他何時會出現
When he'll show up

825
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:20,530
他總帶來一堆麻煩
He gives you plenty of trouble

826
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:24,660
我想他是自命瀟灑
I guess he's just a no 'count pup

827
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:28,330
但我希望他永保風格
But I wish that he were double

828
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:30,450
-他是長云  -嘭  嘭
 -He's a tramp -Bum-bum-bum-ruff

829
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:33,080
-四處流浪  -嘭  嘭
 -He's a rover -Bum-bum-bum-ruff

830
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:36,000
無以形容
And there's nothin' more to say

831
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:39,340
長云
If he's a tramp

832
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,260
他是條好漢
He's a good one

833
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:46,800
希望我能像他一樣
And I wish that I could travel his way

834
00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:51,350
希望我能像他一樣
Wish that I could travel his way

835
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:56,810
希望我能像他一樣
Wish that I could travel his way

836
00:59:58,520 --> 00:59:59,520
對
Yeah.

837
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:01,280
但他總是吊兒郎當
But he never takes them serious.

838
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:06,910
總有一天他會遇見心上人
Ah, but someday he is meeting someone different.

839
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:09,740
一個楚楚動人的美女
Some delicate, fragile creature

840
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:13,290
他愿意照顧  呵護她
who's giving him a wish to shelter and protect.

841
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:16,870
就像這位千金小姐對吧  
Like Miss Park Avenue here, eh, matey?

842
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,000
可能
Hm-hm. Could be.

843
01:00:19,170 --> 01:00:22,460
-但是當他  -對  我看得比你遠
-But when he does... -Yeah. I'm way ahead of ya.

844
01:00:22,630 --> 01:00:25,130
在愛情的魔咒下  
Under the spell of true love...

845
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:27,760
那個家伙一不小心  
The poor chump grows careless...

846
01:00:27,930 --> 01:00:29,800
就被捕狗隊抓走  
The Cossacks are picking him up...

847
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:32,520
長云就完了
And it's curtains for the Tramp.

848
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:36,850
比爾  有點嬌那只
It's the little cocker, Bill.

849
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:39,690
-在四號籠子里  -好
-In number four. -OK.

850
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:42,570
好  來吧
All right, baby.

851
01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:45,320
他們來帶你回家了
They've come to take you home.

852
01:00:45,490 --> 01:00:48,490
這里不屬于你
You're too nice a girl to be in this place.

853
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,290
勇氣
Courage, man.

854
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:01,670
勇氣
Courage!

855
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:02,880
但是  
But, uh...

856
01:01:03,050 --> 01:01:06,130
我沒想過要結婚
I've never even considered matrimony.

857
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:08,180
我也沒有
Nor I.

858
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:10,800
不管她選誰
But no matter which of us she accepts,

859
01:01:10,970 --> 01:01:13,680
永遠不會破壞我們的友誼
we'll always be the best of friends.

860
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:16,180
記住
Now remember,

861
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:19,310
別提那件不幸的事
not a word about her unfortunate experience.

862
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:23,070
-我們不是來傷她的心  -對  對
-We don't want to hurt her feelings. -Uh, yeah. Yeah.

863
01:01:24,030 --> 01:01:25,690
小美女
Lassie.

864
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:28,950
麗滴小姐
Miss Lady, ma'am.

865
01:01:29,110 --> 01:01:32,160
拜托  我誰都不想見
Please, I don't want to see anybody.

866
01:01:32,330 --> 01:01:34,790
小美女
Now, now, lassie.

867
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:36,450
不要這樣
Don't feel that way about it.

868
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:39,210
小美女  不要這樣
Of course not, Miss Lady.

869
01:01:39,370 --> 01:01:42,790
我所見過最棒的那些人
Why, some of the finest people I ever tracked down

870
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,500
-通常都是常進出監獄的  -閉嘴
-were jailbirds. -Quiet!

871
01:01:44,670 --> 01:01:46,380
你個白癡
You great loony!

872
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:49,550
拜托  小美女
Uh, please, lassie.

873
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:53,180
我們有個提議可以幫你
We've come with a proposition for helping ya.

874
01:01:53,350 --> 01:01:55,680
幫我  什么意思  
Help me? What do you mean?

875
01:01:55,850 --> 01:01:57,770
嗯  
Well, now...

876
01:01:57,930 --> 01:01:59,810
小美女  你知道  
You see, lassie...

877
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:02,310
我們兩個都不是年輕人了
Neither of us is as young as we used to be.

878
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:05,320
但還是處于巔峰狀態
But we're still in the prime of life.

879
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:06,480
對
Aye.

880
01:02:06,650 --> 01:02:10,150
我們兩個人的家  都很舒服
And we've both got very comfortable homes.

881
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:12,990
對  我們都知道
That's right. Where we know

882
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:16,330
麗滴小姐  你會備受疼愛
you'll be welcome and appreciated, Miss Lady.

883
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:19,910
所以  講白一點就是  
So... So, to come directly to the point...

884
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:23,080
如果你愿意
If you could, uh...

885
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:26,960
如果你不嫌棄  
...find it possible to, uh...

886
01:02:27,130 --> 01:02:28,260
可以  
To, uh...

887
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:31,840
你們兩個都是好人  我很感謝你們
You're both very kind, and I do appreciate it.

888
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:33,930
-但是  -哦  麗滴
-But... -Oh, Pigeon.

889
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:35,970
哦  麗  
Oh, Pi...

890
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:38,060
哦  嗨  大家好
Oh! Oh, hi, boys.

891
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:43,730
有什么新鮮事嗎  
Anything new in the kennel club set?

892
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,820
麗滴  這個給你
A little something I picked up for you, Pige.

893
01:03:00,370 --> 01:03:02,460
看來我不受歡迎
Looks like I'm the one that's in the doghouse.

894
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:07,090
麗滴小姐  如果你討厭這個家伙  
If this person is annoying you, Miss Lady...

895
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:10,090
我們很樂意趕他出去
We'll gladly throw the rascal out.

896
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:12,760
那倒不必  謝謝你們
That won't be necessary. Thank you.

897
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:15,090
不客氣
Very well, ma'am.

898
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:18,060
你  你  
You... You...

899
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:20,310
這個混混
...mongrel!

900
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:27,610
拜托  麗滴
Aw, come on, Pige.

901
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:30,280
-不是我的錯  -唔
-It wasn't my fault. -Hmph.

902
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,910
我以為你就跟在后面  真的
I thought you were right behind me. Honest.

903
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:36,780
當我聽說你被抓到  
When I heard they'd taken you to the pound...

904
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:39,790
別再提那個恐怖的地方
Oh! Don't even mention that horrible place.

905
01:03:39,950 --> 01:03:42,960
我覺得好丟臉而且  
I was so embarrassed and...

906
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:46,170
-好害怕  -哦
-... and frightened. -Oh, now, now.

907
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:50,130
像你這么可愛的小妞  誰會欺負你  
Who could ever harm a cute little trick like you?

908
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:52,340
小妞  小妞  
Trick? Trick!

909
01:03:52,510 --> 01:03:56,260
-這倒提醒我  崔西是誰  -崔西  
-That reminds me, who is Trixie? -Trixie?

910
01:03:56,430 --> 01:03:59,100
還有露露  菲菲  露西  
And Lulu and Fifi and Rosita Chiquita wh...

911

912
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:03,390
哦  對  我  
Oh! Yes! Well, I... I...

913
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:06,900
你用不著擔心你的臭弱點
As far as I'm concerned, you needn't worry about your old heel.

914
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:08,060
臭弱點  
My heel?

915
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:10,320
我不用你照顧呵護
I don't need you to shelter and protect me.

916
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,940
-對  但是  -如果你不小心被抓  別怪我
-But... -If you grow careless, don't blame me.

917
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:16,780
就算你被抓走  我也不在乎  再見
I don't care if the Cossacks do pick you up! Goodbye.

918
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:20,990
把這個拿走
And take this with you.

919
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:28,600
不要叫了
Stop that.

920
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:33,440
噓  噓
Hush, now, hush.

921
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:39,490
不要再叫了
Stop that racket!

922
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:43,240
麗滴  怎么啦  
What's wrong, Pige?

923
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:45,080
-老鼠  -在哪里  
-A rat! -Where?

924
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:47,410
樓上的嬰兒房
Upstairs, in the baby's room!

925
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:50,250
-從哪里進去  -小門
-How do I get in? -The little door.

926
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:51,710
在走廊那邊
On the porch.

927
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,440
老天
Merciful heavens!

928
01:07:39,610 --> 01:07:43,200
哦  可憐的小寶貝
Oh! Oh, you poor little darling.

929
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:46,280
謝天謝地你沒事
No, no, no. Thank goodness you're not hurt.

930
01:07:46,450 --> 01:07:49,330
你們  你們兩個畜牲  退后
You... You vicious brutes. Back!

931
01:07:49,490 --> 01:07:51,040
退后
Get back!

932
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,410
去啊  進去
Go on! Get back!

933
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:56,880
捕狗隊  對  我找捕狗隊來
The pound. The pound, that's it. I'll call the pound.

934
01:07:59,750 --> 01:08:02,170
過來  你過來

來啊  我現在就打電話找他們
I'll call them this minute.

937
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:09,510
那個畜牲在家里  我一刻都睡不好
I won't sleep a wink with that brute in the house.

938
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:19,940
喂  喂  
Hello? Hello!

939
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:27,280
年輕人  我不管你是不是一個人在那
I don't care if you are alone there, young man.

940
01:08:27,450 --> 01:08:29,950
我要你立刻來把他帶走
I insist you pick him up immediately.

941
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:40,500
達玲  看
Darling, look.

942
01:08:42,130 --> 01:08:45,720
我的建議是  立刻把這個畜牲宰了
If you want my advice you'll destroy that animal at once.

943
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:47,430
別擔心
Don't worry, ma'am.

944
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:50,100
我們早就想抓他了
We've been after this one for months.

945
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:52,060
交給我們處理
We'll take care of him.

946
01:08:55,310 --> 01:08:57,980
-這是  -怎么回事  
-What do you suppose...? -Say, what's going on here?

947
01:08:58,150 --> 01:08:59,940
先生  剛抓到一只流浪狗
Just picking up a stray, mister.

948
01:09:00,110 --> 01:09:02,360
小子  快
Come on, giddap.

949
01:09:02,530 --> 01:09:03,860
他當時正攻擊一個小寶寶
Caught him attacking a baby.

950
01:09:04,030 --> 01:09:05,320
-老天  -我的寶寶
-Good heavens. -My baby.

951

莎拉姑媽
Aunt Sarah!

953

莎拉姑媽
Aunt Sarah!

954
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:17,120
我第一眼看到他  就知道他不是好東西
I was certain he was no good the moment I first laid eyes on him.

955
01:09:17,290 --> 01:09:19,830
對  但是  
Yeah, but, uh...

956
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,250
我沒料到他會做出這種事
I never thought he'd do a thing like that.

957
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:26,840
我及時趕到  他們正在  
Thank goodness I got there in time. There they were...

958
01:09:27,010 --> 01:09:29,260
一定有誤會
No, I'm sure there must be some mistake.

959
01:09:29,430 --> 01:09:30,970
麗滴不會  
Lady wouldn't...

960
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:35,140
小心  那只狗沒綁起來  別讓她靠近寶寶
Watch out! That dog's loose. Keep her away.

961
01:09:35,310 --> 01:09:37,640
胡說  她有事想告訴我們
Nonsense. She's trying to tell us something.

962
01:09:37,810 --> 01:09:40,230
大女孩  怎么啦  
What is it, old girl?

963
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:43,190
你想說  
What are you try...

964
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:45,030
達玲  莎拉姑媽  過來
Darling, Aunt Sarah, come here.

965
01:09:45,190 --> 01:09:48,360
-這是什么  -老鼠
-What is it, Jim? -Aah! A rat!

966
01:09:48,530 --> 01:09:50,200
老鼠  
A rat?

967
01:09:50,370 --> 01:09:52,120
我們怎么沒想到
We should've known.

968
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:55,330
我誤會他了
I misjudged him.

969
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:56,500
真糟糕
Badly.

970
01:09:56,660 --> 01:10:00,120
快  我們要去阻止那輛馬車
Come on. We got to stop that wagon.

971
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:03,630
我們不知道  他們往哪個方向走
But, man, we don't know which way they've gone.

972
01:10:04,130 --> 01:10:06,000
我們聞得出來
We'll track them down.

973
01:10:06,170 --> 01:10:07,340
然后呢  
And then?

974
01:10:07,510 --> 01:10:09,090
我們把他們攔下來
We'll hold them.

975
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:11,130
讓他們動彈不得
Hold them at bay.

976
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:24,560
現在呢  
Now what?

977
01:10:24,730 --> 01:10:27,900
味道  跟著這個味道
The scent. Follow the scent.

978
01:10:33,950 --> 01:10:36,950
面對現實吧
Ach... Let's face it, man.

979
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:39,830
我們都知道你失去嗅覺
We both know you've lost your sense of smell.

980

這是遺傳

這下沒完沒了了
There'll be no living with him from now on.

1022
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:47,410
就像我爺爺以前常說  
As my grandpappy, Old Reliable, used to say...

1023
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:51,620
我有沒有提過我爺爺
I don't recollect if I've ever mentioned Old Reliable before.

1024
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:53,920
查弟叔叔  你從來沒提過
No, you haven't, Uncle Trusty.

1025
01:14:54,670 --> 01:14:57,960
沒有  
Huh? I haven't?

1026

1029
01:15:09,390 --> 01:15:10,980
他說  
Uh...

糟糕
Doggone.

1031

1032
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:21,490
我完全忘了他說過什么
I clean forgot what it was he used to say.

1033
01:15:26,410 --> 01:15:30,950
