Lloyd, even though
it's Christmas Eve,

2283
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:02,570
I want you to know that there's
no place I would rather be

2284
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:05,564
than right here, wiping
my best friend's dookie.

Yeah. Whoa!

Check out the hotties
at 12 o'clock.

That's almost three hours away.

01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:32,170
Can't I check them out now?
