2
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:55,927
OK, kid, out loud now,
so as I can hear what you're sayin'.

3
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,970
I'm checkin' the passengers,
getting on and off.

4
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,604
- Uh-huh. Yeah.
- Front and back.

5
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:03,484
Shuttin' the doors. Rear section first.
Then the front section.

6
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,111
And the doors are closed.

7
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,068
Now I'm checkin' indicator lights
to make sure the doors are locked.

8
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:12,781
I remove my key, go back out the window
for a distance of three oar lengths

9
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:17,073
- to make sure no one's bein' dragged.

10
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,540
51 st Street next stop.
Next stop, 51 st Street.

11
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:28,834
How'd I do?

12
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,841
Now you take my advice, kid.

13
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:18,350
You serve your six months, and
then you put in for the motorman.

14
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,011
Watch it now, we're comin' in.

15
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:22,851
- 59th Street.
- No, it ain't.

16
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:26,896
51st Street.
Sorry, this station is 51st Street.

17
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,731
Never say you're sorry, kid.

18
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:31,989
Someone may come back here
and hit you in your damn nose!

19
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,502
Grand Central Station next stop.
Next stop, Grand Central.

20
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,381
If I was you I'd start studyin' for
that motorman exam right now.

21
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,839
Tell you the truth, Mr. Mattson,
I have been. Wanna hear some?

22
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:56,221
Every car in the IRT is 72 feet long.

23
00:04:56,379 --> 00:05:00,225
Costs $150,000, weighs 75,000lbs.

24
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,912
This is where I be getting off.
Hang in there, you're doin' fine.

25
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,448
Yeah, I'll see ya.

26
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:33,592
Hey, what's the rush, chief?
We ain't gonna leave without ya!

27
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:41,721
33rd Street next stop.
Next stop is 33rd.

28
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:38,274
What's wrong, dude?
Ain't you never seen a sunset before?

29
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,049
Hey! How am I supposed
to see with you...?

30
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,224
- Holy God! What do you want?
- I'm taking your train.

31
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,228
You're takin' my train?

32
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:57,485
Hey!

33
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,067
Turn around.
I got s-s-somethin' to show ya.

34
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,073
- What's goin' on?
- Shut up!

35
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:06,783
I won't tell you again. Open the door
or I'll blow your head off.

36
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,599
May I get by, please?

37
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,226
No, you don't wanna go in there.

38
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,387
Suppose I do anyway?

39
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,103
Then I'll shoot your pee-pee off.

40
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:42,607
Now just go back out the window
and tell me what you see.

41
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,201
Someone leanin' against the head car.

42
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:49,363
The second he comes aboard,
you sh-sh-shut the doors.

43
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:04,093
Keep your hand off
the microphone, buddy.

44
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:07,381
- All right, Mr. Green?
- 100 percent, Mr. Blue.

45
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,924
Get moving, will you?

46
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,210
Oh!

47
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:48,346
Shelley, give that to the meathead
upstairs, will ya?

48
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:51,509
Right this way.
Just follow me.

49
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:54,848
Shelley, have you seen
Lieutenant Garber?

50
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:59,061
Oh! Lieutenant, it's so nice of you
to leave your duties long enough

51
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:02,569
to escort our distinguished
guests around the facilities.

52
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,856
- May I present to you Mr. Yashimura.

53
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,491
Mr. Matsumoto.

54
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,365
Mr. Tomashita.

55
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:17,201
And Mr. Naka... Nakabashi?

56
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:21,793
Uh, these gentlemen are all directors of
the Tokyo Metropolitan Subway System.

57
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:25,793
And gentlemen, I'd like you to meet
Lieutenant Zachary Garber

58
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,462
of our own New York
Transit Authority Police.

59
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,629
A pleasure, gentlemen.

60
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,926
When you're finished,
send them up to 13.

61
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:37,062
The chairman would like to say
goodbye to them personally, OK?

62
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,724
- Sayonara!

63
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:46,230
Follow me, gentlemen. New York City
Subway is the largest in the world,

64
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:50,401
with 237 miles of track, 7,000...

65
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:59,584
Gentlemen, please. New York City
Subway is the largest in the world.

66
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:03,212
7,000 cars, 237 miles of track...

67
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:14,303
- Say "when", Mr. Blue.
- You just keep going, will you?

68
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:34,198
You're still in switchin'. Why don't you
peg it up? You're green all the way.

69
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,364
We're in no hurry.

70
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,624
Your cold sounds pretty bad.

71
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,957
I woke up in the middle
of the night with it.

72
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:48,041
- What happened?
- Must've bucked.

73
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,710
You told me you could drive this thing.

74
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:53,801
It wasn't me, it's the train.
She bucks all the time. She's a dog.

75
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,425
This is the headquarters
of the Transit Police,

76
00:11:57,592 --> 00:12:01,222
which occupies the entire
second floor of this building.

77
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,640
We call it the nerve center.

78
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,776
Right over here, the status board
pinpoints the disposition

79
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:10,405
of every Transit Authority patrolman
presently in the field.

80
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,820
That's it. Get a good shot of that.

81
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,780
Things are usually jumpin'
pretty good in here.

82
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:26,668
I suppose you gentlemen have your share
of crime in the Tokyo subways, right?

83
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:31,839
Right? Well, that's the way it goes.

84
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:36,928
These are the assignment desks. One
for each of the lines: the BMT, the IRT,

85
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,013
here's the IND.

86
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,098
There's our artist in residence.

87
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:45,357
And right through here is our operations
lieutenant, Mr. Rico Patrone,

88
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,609
who, on weekends, works for the Maia.

89
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:51,362
Rico, I'd like you to meet some
good friends of the chairman.

90
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:54,274
-  Hiya.
- Very good friends, Rico.

91
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,862
Hiya.

92
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,574
Rico, these are the directors
of the Tokyo subway.

93
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,874
Why don't you tell these gentlemen
about some of the exciting things

94
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:10,666
that have happened in the New York City
Subway System lately, Rico.

95
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:14,257
Well, we had a bomb scare
in the Bronx yesterday.

96
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,296
But it turned out to be a cantaloupe.

97
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,018
I'm busy, Zach, OK?

98
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,473
In the course of a normal work week,

99
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:32,237
the average TA policeman deals with
such crimes as robbery, assault,

100
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,989
murder, drunkenness,

101
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:38,152
illness, vandalism,

102
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,911
mishegaas,

103
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:43,869
abusiveness, sexual molestation,

104
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,033
exhibitionism...

105
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:51,423
-  What's your name, motorman?
- Denny Doyle, sir.

106
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,583
- Ever been written up?
- Yes, sir. Once.

107
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,924
- What for?
- Runnin' a red signal. How about you?

108
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,509
Twice. Once on the Canarsie...

109
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:04,143
That's right, Mr. Green. Tell Mr. Doyle
all about yourself, will you?

110
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,439
OK. Stop it about here.

111
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,366
I'm takin' your brake handle
and the reverse key, Denny.

112
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,953
I want your cuttin' key also.

113
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,872
That's it.

114
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:30,370
You'll be hearing from Command Center
in a minute or two.

115
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,631
You won't answer, you will ignore
the call. Is that clear, Mr. Doyle?

116
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,259
Yes, sir. They can call
all they want. I'm deaf.

117
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:42,306
- Thanks, Mr. Grey.
- Don't mention it, Mr. Green, right?

118
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:46,265
Right. Let's have your
cab key, conductor.

119
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,600
I can't do that.
I ain't supposed to do that.

120
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:53,234
You got three seconds
to live, conductor. One, two...

121
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:54,861
OK, OK, OK.

122
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:59,695
It'll mean my job.
What's he gonna do?

123
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:02,986
You wouldn't want me to spoil
the s-s-surprise, would you?

124
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,541
Until then, stay where you are.
Go back to normal speed when...

125
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:16,341
Command Center callin' Pelham
One Two Three. Come in, please.

126
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,672
Sorry, I couldn't help it.
It was automatic.

127
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,008
Pelham One Two Three,
do you read me?

128
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,428
Come in, Pelham One Two Three.

129
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,098
Pelham One Two Three,
where the fuck are you?

130
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:31,105
Hey! What's the goddamn hurry?

131
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:34,859
I told you, one of my men dropped
his wedding ring down the john!

132
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,520
- What are you runnin' for?
- Who's runnin'?

133
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:43,284
- How come that gate ain't locked?
- Who's gonna steal a subway train?

134
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,741
Grand Central Tower
callin' Command Center.

135
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,122
Have you picked up on
Pelham One Two Three yet?

136
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,659
Keep your shirt on.
That's what we're tryin' to find out.

137
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:54,045
- What'd he say?
- They're backed up all along the line.

138
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:57,298
Jesus Christ, Caz, you picked
a hell of a day to be late!

139
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,710
You wanted a plumber
down here, didn't ya?

140
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:03,380
- Whose goddamn wedding ring was it?
- Mrs. Jenkins'. But, Caz...

141
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:06,049
Sorry, Mr. Dolowicz.
It just slipped off.

142
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:09,264
- Why was your hand in the john anyway?
- My hand wasn't...

143
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:12,727
Go fish it out, would ya?
The toilet's behind the board.

144
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:15,392
Caz, listen to me! There's a train down!

145
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:18,357
Classification's been open
to a woman for only a month

146
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,318
and already we're in a goddamn toilet!

147
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:26,035
- What the hell's that?
- Marino's been tryin' to tell ya.

148
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:29,243
He's layin' down between 28th and 23rd.

149
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:33,410
- What the hell for? How long?
- A couple, three minutes.

150
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:37,171
Command Center's been tryin' to raise
him, but he don't answer his phone.

151
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,584
Jeez, Caz, why don't
he answer his radio?

152
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,423
Maybe his radio's busted

153
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:46,215
and the son of a bitch is too lazy
to climb down and use the phone.

154
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,304
I'm gonna write him up for this!
I'm gonna have his ass!

155
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,274
Hey, it's movin'.

156
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:09,116
For Jesus Christ's sake,
the dumb bastard is movin' backwards.

157
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,121
Look. He left the front car behind.

158
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,375
The goddamn board must be busted.

159
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,548
He stopped again.

160
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,631
Well, stopped is better
than backwards at least.

161
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:28,969
What was that? I didn't know
these things went backwards.

162
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,553
Now you know.

163
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:37,857
Would you mind tellin' me
what you gentlemen are doing?

164
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,312
Yeah, I would.

165
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,005
Come in, Pelham One Two Three.
Come in.

166
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,716
- All right, Mr. Green?
- Smooth as silk, Mr. Blue.

167
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,425
- How do you feel?
- Oh, great.

168
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:10,681
Get out, Doyle.

169
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,561
Here's your gun. Get going.
We're already two minutes late.

170
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:18,565
Pelham One Two Three.
Do you hear me, Pelham One Two Three?

171
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,442
Hey, look. The front car's movin'.
And forward this time.

172
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:29,576
- Yeah, yeah. I've got eyes, haven't I?
- What's goin' on down there?

173
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,161
Are you children with anybody?

174
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,743
You children... you with anybody?

175
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,407
Yeah. My mother.

176
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,706
Go back and join her.

177
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:42,713
- Why?
- Go back and join your mother.

178
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:46,718
- Mom, we wanna play.

179
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,572
Your attention, please.

180
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,611
Now then, you'll all remain seated.

181
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:16,247
Anybody who tries to rise
is going to get shot.

182
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,998
There's another one!

183
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,004
Shut up!

184
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,507
Move up a bit, Mr. Doyle.

185
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,761
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
you see this gun?

186
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,220
It fires 750 rounds of 9-millimeter
ammunition per minute.

187
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:39,604
In other words, if all of you
simultaneously were to rush me,

188
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:43,892
not a single one of you would get
any closer than you are right now.

189
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:45,981
- Mom, are those real guns?
- Shh!

190
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,776
I do hope I have made myself understood.

191
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,380
He stopped again. The crazy dumb-ass
son of a bitch stopped again.

192
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,424
He's halfway between stations!
What the hell...?

193
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,807
Pure mental case.

194
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,390
I'm gonna nail his pecker
to the goddamn wall for this.

195
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:23,227
- Caz, take it easy, will ya?
-  Oh, come on!

196
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:24,641
If I gotta watch my language

197
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:27,276
because they let a few broads in,
I'm gonna quit!

198
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:30,234
How can you run a goddamn railroad
without swearin'?!

199
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,398
Grand Central Terminal,
this is the train master.

200
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:33,817
Who's in charge down there?

201
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:37,328
It's for you, Mr. Dolowicz.

202
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:42,458
It's me, Frank. Caz Dolowicz.
We're watchin' it on the board.

203
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:45,119
What the hell good is watchin' it?!
I got trains pilin' up behind it!

204
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:49,291
- Get some supervision down there!
- it's on its way, Frank.

205
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,208
I'll be back.

206
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,848
- I've turned off the power.

207
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:02,012
All right, everybody in this part
of the car, move to the back.

208
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:06,149
Come on. Everybody in the front part
of the car move to the back.

209
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:12,109
- What the hell is goin' on?
- Move back, please, and sit down.

210
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,901
-  May I say something, please?

211
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,160
You mind letting us know
what's happening here?

212
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:21,869
- Please, listen to me...
- Be quiet and sit down!

213
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,659
- Let's go, honey.
- Don't touch...

214
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,538
All right, Mr. Doyle.

215
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,081
What are you gonna do?

216
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,918
- What about this one?
- Let her sleep.

217
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:36,928
What you're going to do,
Mr. Doyle, is to go back,

218
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:40,057
collect all the passengers
from the cars we've cut loose,

219
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:43,720
and walk them to 28th Street station.

220
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:47,356
- People hate to get off in a tunnel...
- Just do as you're told.

221
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,065
Excuse me.

222
00:21:56,232 --> 00:22:00,282
Excuse me. Can I go with him? I got
this very important appointment to see.

223
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,078
Nobody else leaves.

224
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,949
Aw, shit.

225
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:09,750
I'm sure you wouldn't mind
if the children were to go.

226
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:14,755
Sit down, madam. Didn't you hear
what I said? I said nobody else leaves.

227
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:19,047
Excuse me, mister. Don't you think
we should be let in on what's happening?

228
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:22,513
What's happening, sir, is that you're
being held by four very dangerous men

229
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,143
armed with machine guns.

230
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:27,350
- Ask a foolish question...

231
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,390
Be quiet.

232
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:32,936
Be quiet! Nothing will happen
as long as you obey my orders.

233
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:35,525
Shit, man. That's what they said
in Vietnam,

234
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,406
and I still got my ass
shot full of lead.

235
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:39,442
- Shut your mouth, nigger!

236
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:44,781
- And keep it shut.
- Mr. Grey!

237
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,760
it's terrible.

238
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,684
Who asked you to look?

239
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:10,147
All right, Mr. Green?

240
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:13,435
The power's off
from 14th Street to 33rd.

241
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:17,697
All four tracks. Local and express.

242
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:19,949
The north and the southbound.

243
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,825
Why am I still seeing lights?

244
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:24,658
That's emergency.
They run on AC like the signals.

245
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:27,285
- Stop that, will you?
- Sorry.

246
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:29,746
- Leave the door open.
-  Command Center calling Pelham.

247
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,502
Did you cut off the power down there?

248
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,915
Without callin' to explain?
Huh? Now you listen to me.

249
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,253
Cut this out and answer me.

250
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,168
You're screwing up the whole
New York City subway system.

251
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:45,807
Gentlemen, this is
the TA Command Center, come on in.

252
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,469
A lot of laughs in here. Terrific place.

253
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:51,640
You see, each train is identified
by the name of its terminus

254
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,227
and the time of its departure.

255
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:59,318
Thus an express train leavin' Woodlawn
at 6:30pm would be Woodlawn 6-3-0.

256
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,324
While on its return trip its destination
might be, uh...

257
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:05,032
let's say, like, Flatbush 8-2-5.

258
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:08,118
I hope you're memorizin' all this junk.
I'm gonna ask questions later.

259
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,702
Garber, what's the matter with you?

260
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,959
Don't worry. They don't understand
a word of English.

261
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,461
This way, dummies.
Step this way, dummies.

262
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,716
Over here is Frank Correll,
the Lord Byron

263
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,876
of the New York City Subway System.

264
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:23,762
Observe the way fire and smoke
shoot out of his ears.

265
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:25,673
Don't bug me, Garber.
I got troubles here.

266
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,011
What's the matter?

267
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:30,724
A train is down, its radio's dead, the
power's off, and it's dumped its load.

268
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,308
Aside from that,
everything's ginger-peachy.

269
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:37,734
What time is it, Mr. Green?

270
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,065
Uh...

271
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:41,276
2:10.

272
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:49,913
Right. Time to talk to them.

273
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,452
- ls something troubling you?
-I think I'm gonna die today.

274
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,291
That's entirely possible.

275
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:04,303
This is Pelham One Two Three
to Command Center.

276
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:08,182
This is Pelham One Two Three to
Command Center. Do you read me?

277
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,763
OK, we'll leave him alone
to his problems.

278
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,644
Where have you been?
What are you tryin' to do?

279
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:14,931
Screw up this entire railroad
single-handedly?

280
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:16,940
I want an explanation
and it better be good!

281
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:18,897
Your train has been taken.

282
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,400
- What?
- Repeat, your train has been taken.

283
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:25,533
Hey, shut up in here! Shut up!

284
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,489
I said shut it, everybody!

285
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,116
Shut it up, everybody, goddamnit!

286
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,119
What do you mean
the train has been taken?

287
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:35,034
- Are you the motorman?
-  Negative.

288
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,548
Nobody's authorized to be in that cab
except the motorman. Identify yourself.

289
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,379
Listen, Train Master,

290
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,795
Your locomotive has been hijacked
by a group of heavily armed men.

291
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,762
It what?

292
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:56,476
We are holding 17 passengers and
the conductor hostage in the first car.

293
00:25:57,264 --> 00:26:00,313
I am quite prepared to kill any
or all of them

294
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:02,899
if you do not obey my commands
to the letter.

295
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:06,407
- Have I made myself quite clear?
- You're outta your skull!

296
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:11,157
Be that as it may, get out a pen,
take down our fist of demands.

297
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,494
Hey, now wait a minute.
Hold on. Stand by.

298
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,330
Why would anybody hijack
a goddamn subway train?

299
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:20,918
Hit your six button, Frank.
I want the TA police in on this.

300
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,878
What are all these Chinamen
doin' in here?

301
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,342
Holy Christ, I forgot.

302
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:27,845
Charlie, take these monkeys up to 13.

303
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:31,007
It is all right, Lieutenant Garber.

304
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:34,017
I am sure we can find it by ourselves.

305
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:39,522
And thank you for a most
instructive visit, Lieutenant.

306
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:42,730
A most exciting tour, Lieutenant.
Most exciting.

307
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:44,361
Most exciting.

308
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,030
Garber to Patrone. Garber to Patrone.

309
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,284
Come in, Patrone.

310
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,918
This is Patrone.

311
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:01,954
Rico, I want you to plug
everythin' you got

312
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:04,715
into the IRT train master's circuit.

313
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,046
And all units stand by on the double.

314
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:11,214
Call in the City cops. Put it on a 911
so their computer gets it.

315
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,723
What's up, Z?

316
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,725
- You won't believe it.
- I'll believe anythin'.

317
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,306
A train's been hijacked.

318
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:20,188
I don't believe it.

319
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,113
When did the power go?

320
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,250
- Hey! Conductor, when did the power go?
-  Who wants to know?

321
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:42,708
Me! The supervisor of the Grand
Central Tower wants to know!

322
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:46,795
Oh, yes, sir! A couple of minutes ago!
Hey, what happened down there?

323
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,050
Who wants to know!

324
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,090
No, nobody's hurt!

325
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:53,972
-  What's goin' on?
- I don't know what's goin' on!

326
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:56,054
- What happened?
- Nothin' happened, lady.

327
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,310
- Was anybody killed?
- Nobody's killed.

328
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:07,353
On the left now, watch out for
the third rail. On the left now.

329
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,732
What the hell is this,
for Christ's sake?

330
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,787
Your attention, please,
ladies and gentlemen.

331
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:21,871
I'm sure the more intelligent of you
have worked out you're all hostages.

332
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:25,504
- Oh, my God!

333
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,630
Isn't that wonderful.

334
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:30,963
- Hostages.
- What did you think? Guests?

335
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:33,675
When we get what we want,
you'll be released unharmed.

336
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:37,307
Until then, you'll continue to do
precisely as you're told.

337
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:47,314
Excuse me, sir. What's going to happen
to us if you don't get what you want?

338
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:51,731
Excuse me, sir. We are going
to get what we want.

339
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,494
I don't give a damn
what they were armed with.

340
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,405
They were gonna kill me!

341
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:04,327
You're like the captain of the ship!
You're supposed to go down with it!

342
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:07,497
-  Horseshit!
- Oh, lady, butt out!

343
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:11,008
Tell Command Center
I'll be on my way to investigate!

344
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:14,340
I wouldn't go
down there if I was you!

345
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:16,597
I know you wouldn't!

346
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,886
You work for the subway, mister?

347
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:21,802
Tell 'em I'm gonna sue!
I'm gonna sue their ass off!

348
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,028
Pelham One Two Three
to Command Center.

349
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:35,570
Do you read me? Are you ready
to take down our list of demands?

350
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,780
I'm listening, you animal.
What do you want?

351
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:40,412
- Do you have your pen?
- Go on, for Pete's sake!

352
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,249
It's important you understand
three things.

353
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:47,787
One, Pelham One Two Three
is completely within our control.

354
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:50,422
Two, we are all armed
with automatic weapons.

355
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,049
Three, we have no scruples
whatsoever about killing.

356
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:56,257
- Do you understand me so far?
- I understand you tine, you lunatic.

357
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,922
You'll never get away with this.

358
00:29:58,088 --> 00:30:01,058
Inform the mayor that we demand
one million dollars cash

359
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,890
for the release of the car
and all the hostages.

360
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:07,898
- That'll be the day.
- The time is now 2:13.

361
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:10,559
The money must be in our hands
not later than 3:13.

362
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:12,399
One hour from now.

363
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:14,234
If the money is not in our hands,

364
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:17,320
we'll kill one hostage
for every minute you're late.

365
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:20,361
Keep dreamin', maniac.

366
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:23,997
If anybody attempts to interfere
- anyone, in any way -

367
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:27,035
we will begin killing the hostages
immediately.

368
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,081
Confirm, please.

369
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,917
Zach! Zach!

370
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:34,504
- Pelham One Two Three, come in, please.
-  This is Pelham.

371
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,589
Identify yourself, please.

372
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:40,052
This is Lieutenant Zachary Garber
of the Transit Police.

373
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:42,716
Identify yourself, please.

374
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:44,681
I'm the man who stole your train.

375
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,937
Sir, there is no way
you can get away with this.

376
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,223
You are underground in a tunnel.

377
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,312
Why do you concern yourself with that?

378
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,445
At precisely 3:13 we are going
to begin executing the hostages.

379
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:58,198
You'd better get in touch with the mayor
and get back to me

380
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:01,236
for my further instructions.
Over and out.

381
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:04,450
Son of a bitch has got me backed up
all the way to the Bronx!

382
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:07,162
What is this, a circus?
Let's get back to work!

383
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:08,701
Rico, did you get that?

384
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,962
I only got your end of it, but I
could piece it together. it's crazy.

385
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:16,671
The guy's got a heavy English accent.
He could be a fruitcake.

386
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,006
We got anybody at 28th Street?

387
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:22,931
Just checkin' it out.
Yeah, he's around there somewhere.

388
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:26,811
Tell him to hold the fort. Could be
all day before the City cops show up.

389
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:29,221
They're never around when you need 'em.

390
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:35,315
Lex 28. Lex 28.
Come in, please.

391
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:36,649
Patrolman James.

392
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:39,861
This is Lieutenant Patrone.
Where are you?

393
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,650
28th Street, southbound.

394
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:43,911
Look, Lieutenant,
everything's cooled out.

395
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,492
I mean nothing's happening.
What's goin' on?

396
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:50,000
Look, don't react to this,
but a train's been hijacked.

397
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,583
- Holy shit.
- For God's sake, don't say anything.

398
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,999
Oh, there's a supervisor
from Grand Central Tower missing.

399
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,884
Yeah, I saw him a few minutes ago.
He went down the track on foot.

400
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,759
Look, you better go after him.
See if you can turn him back.

401
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,014
Yes, sir.

402
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:20,318
All I know is I am the goddamn
mayor of the goddamn city of New York,

403
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,451
the second most important
elective office in the entire country,

404
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,112
and you tell me
I gotta lay here and suffer

405
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,781
like every other schlub in the country?

406
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:33,828
I'm sorry you have the flu, Mr. Mayor.
There's nothing more I can do.

407
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:36,918
There's one more thing. Get out!

408
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:42,257
You can't fight City Hall.

409
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:45,719
Couple number two,
Arthur and Eleanor you have 20 points.

410
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:49,518
...correctly and you'll move
into first place.

411
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,394
- Yeah?

412
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:53,271
Al, it's Warren.
I'm comin' upstairs.

413
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,057
I got a real bitch on our hands.

414
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,942
Don't tell me. I don't wanna know.

415
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:01,696
- I'm comin' up.
- Can't you handle it, Warren?

416
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:04,734
You are the goddamn
deputy mayor of the city of...

417
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,905
Sure I can handle it. Like I handle
every other fifth y, stinkin' job

418
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:12,074
in this whole miserable city,
but I'm not gonna do it.

419
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,242
What is it? Another strike?

420
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,458
All right, all right.
I can take another strike.

421
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:21,251
A gang of men has hijacked
a subway train.

422
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,339
A gang of men...'?

423
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:28,258
Has hijacked a subway train.
They want a million dollars for it.

424
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:30,846
Come on up.

425
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:40,861
Couple number one are
the winners of today's Newlywed Game!

426
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,441
Missed it!

427
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,298
What do you want, Mr. Green?

428
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,459
Is everythin' OK?

429
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:08,631
Go and sit down. I do not want Mr. Grey
and Mr. Brown alone with the passengers.

430
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:11,721
- Don't you trust them?
- I trust Mr. Brown.

431
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,477
I do not trust Mr. Grey.

432
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:18,641
I think that Mr. Grey is an enormous
arrogant pain in the arse

433
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:21,105
who could turn out to be trouble.

434
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:23,191
I also think that he is mad.

435
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:26,490
Why do you think
they threw him out of the Mafia?

436
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,697
Ohh, terrific.

437
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:43,757
Hold it right there,
cowboy!

438
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,132
Who are you?!

439
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:47,260
You'll find out
if you take another step!

440
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:52,303
I'm warnin' ya, mister! That's City
property you're foolin' around with!

441
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,135
That's just too fuckin' bad!

442
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:58,806
Why don't you go grab a goddamn
aeroplane like everybody else?

443
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:02,602
'Cause we're afraid of flyin'!
Clear out or I'll shoot your ass off!

444
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,145
The hell with you! I'm comin' on board!

445
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:06,939
I warned you, stupid!

446
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:15,034
Holy shit.

447
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:22,166
I warned the bastard,
but he kept on comin' anyway.

448
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,377
- Was he alone?
-I didn't see nobody else.

449
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,213
- Mr. Brown.

450
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,377
I guess I got us
on the scoreboard, right?

451
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:36,385
Take over from Mr. Grey.

452
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:40,351
- A little quick with that gun.
- The jerk was comin' on board!

453
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,356
- Loved every minute of it.

454
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:45,735
- Keep those children quiet.
-  I'm trying! I can't!

455
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:48,989
- Do you want me to try?
- Oh, my God! No!

456
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:52,451
You said nobody was gonna get hurt.

457
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:56,367
Patrolman James
callin' Operations.

458
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:58,577
This is Patrone.
Did you find that supervisor?

459
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,538
- Shh!

460
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:04,421
- He's dead, Lieutenant.
- Speak up, will ya? I can't hear ya.

461
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:09,050
I can't. I'm only 20 yards away
from the hijacked train.

462
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:12,554
They just shot him with a machine gun.

463
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,885
Is he dead?

464
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:18,302
- Wouldn't you be, Lieutenant?
- Stay put and keep an eye on things.

465
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:22,602
Z! They just drew first blood.

466
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:26,268
That supervisor from Grand Central
Tower. They just killed him.

467
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:29,904
Oh, my God. Thanks, Rico.

468
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:32,816
Frank, do you know who went
to 28th from Grand Central?

469
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:36,657
- Yeah, Caz Dolowicz. Why?
- Jeez. I knew him.

470
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,448
Hey, whaddaya mean, you knew him?

471
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,583
They just shot him.

472
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,460
Dead?

473
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:47,456
- Caz? Fat Caz?
- Yeah.

474
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:50,717
-  Garber?
- Aw, shit!

475
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,382
Garber? Are you there, Zach?

476
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:57,674
- Yeah, who is this?
- Costello.

477
00:36:57,841 --> 00:36:58,808
Yes, Captain.

478
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:02,471
I'm puttin' you in charge at this end.
I'm goin' to headquarters.

479
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:05,732
If I don't show up,
the city cops'll hog all the action.

480
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,609
There 's one on board the train.
One of the hostages.

481
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,442
You're kiddin'. There's a cop
on the train? How do you know?

482
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,902
There were two,
but one got off at 33rd

483
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,193
and called in later
when the news got out.

484
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,953
That means the other one's
still on the train.

485
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:21,831
- Plainclothes?
- Yeah, Tactical Force.

486
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:25,915
- Man or woman?
- I never even thought to ask.

487
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,624
Well, doesn't make any difference.

488
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:30,131
Whoever it is can't
do very much single-handed.

489
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:34,677
Warren, I thought it over.
I know what we're gonna do.

490
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:35,883
Tell me.

491
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:38,844
We're gonna let 'em keep
the goddamn subway train.

492
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:41,760
We got plenty of them.
We'll never even miss it.

493
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,554
How about the 18 hostages?
We gonna miss them?

494
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:48,692
Warren, goddamnit!
This city hasn't got a million dollars!

495
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:52,775
Empty one of your Swiss bank accounts,
because there's no other way out.

496
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,440
- Don't we get to think about it?
- There's no time.

497
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:59,032
I still want the full picture.
Get me the police commissioner,

498
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:03,119
the chairman of the Transit Authority,
and that putz we got for a comptroller.

499
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:06,376
They're on their way,
but it's no good runnin' to them, AI.

500
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:09,287
You're the mayor.
The buck stops with you.

501
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:12,003
- Oh, shit.
- God help us.

502
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,547
Shit! Piss! Fuck!

503
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,554
Call Charlie. Tell him
I'll get to him as soon as I can.

504
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,260
Where's that list on 144?

505
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,926
Command Center callin'
Pelham One Two Three.

506
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:25,015
Hey Frank, you're hoggin' my circuits.

507
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:27,476
What do you want from me? I got
motormen callin' me from all over!

508
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:30,859
Tell 'em to get off the air.
I need some more lines open here.

509
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:34,772
So talkin' to murderers takes priority
over runnin' a railroad?

510
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:38,192
Get off it. My only priority is
savin' the lives of these passengers.

511
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:42,158
Screw the passengers! What do they
expect for 35 cents? To live forever?

512
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:44,531
Oh, you're beautiful.

513
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:48,497
- Do you read me, Pelham?
- I'd go in with guns and blast 'em out!

514
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:53,086
Why don't you start doin' your own work
and let the police do theirs, huh?

515
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,671
Like that cop on the train.
When's he gonna start shootin'?

516
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,802
We don't know if it is a "he“.

517
00:38:57,961 --> 00:39:00,805
- Do you read me, Pelham?
- Women cops! What good are they?

518
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:03,717
Probably can't find her gun
in her goddamn purse!

519
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,261
Pelham One Two Three.
Any news to report?

520
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:09,146
What's that about news?
Say again about news.

521
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:12,650
I said have you any news to report?

522
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:15,187
- No, nothin' yet.

523
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:17,026
Gesundheit!

524
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,780
- What are you calling about?
- Pelham, we need more time.

525
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:22,740
Shut the door, please.

526
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,580
It is 2:24, Lieutenant.
You've got 49 minutes left.

527
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:31,210
Be reasonable, will ya?
We're tryin' to cooperate,

528
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:34,623
but we can't do anything if you don't
give us enough time to work with.

529
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:35,915
49 minutes.

530
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:39,757
We're dealin' with City Hall. You know
what a mess of red tape that is?

531
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,045
49 minutes.

532
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:44,140
Look, fella, we know how
to tell time as well as you do,

533
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:47,553
but we aren't gonna get any place
if all you do is repeat "49 minutes!"

534
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,054
48 minutes.

535
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:53,521
Yeah, all right, all right.
We'll get back to you as soon as we can.

536
00:39:57,061 --> 00:40:00,486
To hear you plead with that chickenshit
makes me ashamed to be an American!

537
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,650
Go play with your trains.

538
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:12,123
Stay tuned for an update
on the subway hijacking case.

539
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:16,165
- Get me the borough commander.

540
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:18,834
- Turn off that goddamn music.
- Yes, sir.

541
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,675
Harry? I'm headin' up to see the mayor.
What's it look like down there?

542
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:26,432
It's murder, Phil, as usual.
They really smell blood on this one.

543
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:30,016
- Who's your number two?
- Deputy Chief Inspector Daniels.

544
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:33,057
He's a good man, Phil.
He handled that protest last month.

545
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:36,817
- Get those photographers outta here!
- How are you deployed?

546
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:39,855
Fifty men inside the tunnel,
north and south of the train,

547
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:43,525
well concealed, all wearing vests
and armed with machine guns,

548
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:47,912
shotguns, handguns, riot guns and
a half-dozen snipers with night scopes.

549
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:49,789
We could Tight
the Third World War down there!

550
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:52,076
Make sure they stay outta sight.

551
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,460
If the hijackers see 'em,
we'll have a massacre.

552
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:58,465
We have a sniper's report that
they're movin' around pretty freely.

553
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:01,376
The one in the motorman's cab
is an easy shot.

554
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:06,298
Absolutely no! Understand? We're takin'
the threat seriously! What's upstairs?

555
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:10,560
Trucks, cars, emergency medical
and rescue units. The works, Phil.

556
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,891
Harry... tell me somethin', will ya?

557
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:17,313
They're in a tunnel, surrounded on all
sides. How do they expect to get away?

558
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:21,229
Beats the shit out of me, Phil.

559
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:28,116
Oh, AI, it's disgustinig.
Would you stop it with the tissue?

560
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:32,828
Warren, tell him that other mayors have
to live in this house after we're gone.

561
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:36,370
Go on in there, AI, and I'll send
everybody in. Just sit down.

562
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:39,585
Thanks for comin' up
on such short notice, fellas.

563
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:43,342
- You all know Jessie, don't you?

564
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:46,380
Good, Phil, just in time.

565
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:47,672
A little coffee? Some cake?

566
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,558
Better skip it, Jessie.
We're short on time.

567
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:52,936
We know what's goin' on underground.

568
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:55,768
The issue is whether or not
we pay the ransom.

569
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,149
Phil? Whaddaya think?

570
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:03,438
Well, we're fully mobilized. There's
enough firepower to wipe out an army.

571
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:06,699
But... I can't guarantee
the safety of the hostages.

572
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:08,860
In other words, you're for
payin' the ransom.

573
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,951
Well, we don't want
another Attica, do we?

574
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:15,116
-  So your vote is?
- I abstain.

575
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:17,627
Shit. Barney?

576
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:19,753
The safety of the passengers

577
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:22,461
is the only concern
of the Transit Authority.

578
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:25,046
- Your vote?
- Pay the two dollars.

579
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:28,304
If it was two dollars,
I'd pay the two dollars, Barney!

580
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:32,343
It's a million! A one with six zeros!
Is it comin' outta your pocket?

581
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:36,308
Come on, will ya save the poor mouth
for later? How do you vote?

582
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:40,192
- I'm not through discussin' it yet.
-  Yes, you are. Now vote.

583
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:42,977
My concern is with the taxpayers.

584
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:46,444
I always say millions for defense
but not one cent for tribute.

585
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:49,610
- isn't that what I always say?
- Uh-huh. So that's a “no...

586
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:55,241
All right, AI. You've heard from
the Three Wise Men.

587
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:59,912
- Now what do you say?
- What are they goin' to say, Warren?

588
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:02,497
- They who?
- Who? Everybody!

589
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:06,167
- The press! The man on the street!
- He means the voters.

590
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:08,007
- You know what they'll say.

591
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:10,672
The Times will support you,
The News will knock you.

592
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,932
The Post will take both sides
at the same time.

593
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:14,764
The rich'll support you.
Likewise the blacks.

594
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:18,305
The Puerto Ricans won't give a shit.
So quit stalling.

595
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:23,523
Stop bullyin' everybody, Warren!
This is supposed to be a democracy!

596
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,027
Wise up, for Christ sake!

597
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:28,156
We're tryin' to run a city,
not a goddamn democracy!

598
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:32,322
Al, quit fartin' around!
We've gotta pay!

599
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:34,203
- Jessie?
- Hmm?

600
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:36,410
Jessie, what do you say?

601
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:39,371
A million dollars
sounds like a lot of money.

602
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:41,582
But just think what
you're gonna get in return.

603
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:45,749
- What?
- 18 sure votes.

604
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:50,670
All right. All right. Warren?

605
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:54,849
- Warren, arrange for the payoff.
- Hallelujah.

606
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:58,807
You heard him. Phil, pass the word to
the bad guys that we're coughing up.

607
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:02,770
- What bank do we do business with?
- City National Trust. I'll call.

608
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:06,027
I'll call. You'll take an hour tryin'
to knock down the interest rate.

609
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:10,940
Jessie?

610
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:15,612
I think I handled it all right.

611
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:18,076
A regular Fiorello La Guardia.

612
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:24,587
Patrolman James
callin' Operations.

613
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,497
This is Patrone.
What's going on?

614
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,793
There's a lot of feet movin' around
out here in the dark.

615
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:32,758
I figure it's a couple of dozen
sharpshooters and snipers.

616
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,173
- Am I right?
- l wouldn't be surprised.

617
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:40,687
Make sure they know I'm standin' here
between them and the hijackers.

618
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:43,018
I'm not all that easy
to see in the dark.

619
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:49,937
Nothing yet?

620
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:55,034
Boy! They're sure takin'
their time, aren't they?

621
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:57,116
Don't worry. They're gonna have to pay.

622
00:44:58,571 --> 00:45:00,073
Suppose they don't?

623
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:03,083
Well, then a lot of people
are gonna die, aren't they?

624
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:05,954
Including us.

625
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:09,666
Better than selling
life insurance, isn't it?

626
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:12,756
Life insurance? You told me
you were in the army.

627
00:45:12,919 --> 00:45:16,799
I was. That's where I developed
my expensive tastes.

628
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:19,968
British army. $150 a month.
You gotta be kiddin'.

629
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:22,853
The Africans paid me 5,000.

630
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:26,562
- A month?
- For leading a battalion.

631
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:30,103
Jesus! What the hell did
you get outta that for?

632
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,522
Because the market dried up.

633
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:34,815
Wow!

634
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,493
5,000!

635
00:45:39,946 --> 00:45:43,041
At least you weren't fired.
But I don't give a shit.

636
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:45,827
What guy wants to drive a subway train
for the rest of his life?

637
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:49,289
What did they catch you doing?

638
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,298
N... Nothin'.

639
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:56,091
I mean, they framed me.
They needed a fall guy.

640
00:45:56,254 --> 00:46:00,134
Transit cops. Undercover guys.
They got wind of a gang passin' dope.

641
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:04,679
Transporting from downtown to uptown,
and givin' it to a motorman.

642
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:07,724
They tried to pin the evidence on me,
but they didn't find a thing.

643
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:10,851
You were innocent?

644
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:13,692
Of course I was innocent.
You think I'd do a thing like that?

645
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,363
I'm on my way to headquarters.
We got the green light.

646
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:25,534
Green light? That's great news.
The men are rarin' to go.

647
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:30,206
No! We're paying 'em the ransom money.
Pass the word along to the hijackers.

648
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:31,543
Roger.

649
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:35,467
Borough Command to the 28th Street
platform. Come in, Daniels.

650
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,628
- Daniels, do you read me?
- This is Daniels.

651
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:42,016
The mayor's agreed to pay.
Let the hijackers know right away.

652
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,346
Roger.

653
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:47,305
Command Center, this is 28th Street.

654
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:50,395
Do you read me, Command Center?

655
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:54,521
- This is Command Center. Who is this?
- Chief Inspector Daniels.

656
00:46:54,687 --> 00:46:57,907
The mayor's agreed to pay.
Pass it on to the hijackers right away.

657
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:00,030
Will do, sir.

658
00:47:01,444 --> 00:47:02,912
Pelham One Two Three.

659
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,414
Come in, Pelham One Two Three.

660
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:07,701
This is Pelham One Two Three.
I read you.

661
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:12,121
We agree to pay the ransom.
Repeat, we agree to pay...

662
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:14,711
What? They're gonna do what?

663
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:16,592
Do you read me, Pelham One Two Three?

664
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:18,719
- Zach, you're outta your skull.
- Hey, will ya?

665
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:20,425
I read you, Garber.

666
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:24,218
Take down my next instructions,
to be followed to the letter.

667
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:28,438
The money's to be paid
in the following denominations:

668
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:30,598
500,000 dollars in Hf ties.

669
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:33,018
500,000 dollars in hundreds. Right?

670
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:36,938
500,000 in fifties. 500,000 in hundreds.

671
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:40,028
Which will be put
in stacks of 200 bills each,

672
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:42,114
bound with two thick elastic bands.

673
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:46,288
Two stacks of bills, bound in what?

674
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:50,080
Bound with thick elastic bands.

675
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:52,119
Point two: All of the bills
will be old bills,

676
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,380
their serial numbers to be random.

677
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,256
Now that's all.
When the delivery arrives

678
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:59,294
we'll contact you
with further instructions.

679
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:02,930
- About what? Your getaway?
- Signing off now.

680
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:04,636
Son of a bitch!

681
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,259
Hey, Pelham.

682
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:10,270
It might interest you to know
I figured out how you're gonna do it.

683
00:48:13,933 --> 00:48:16,652
Yes, it would interest me very much.

684
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:19,564
You're gonna make every man, woman
and child in New York City

685
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,698
close their eyes and count
to a hundred, right?

686
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:26,496
It is now 2:47. That means
you have got 26 minutes...

687
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:31,080
Hey, wait a minute, pal. We agreed
to pay the money. Turn your clock off!

688
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:34,291
- 26 minutes.
- Your instructions were complicated.

689
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:37,002
The money has to be counted,
stacked, tied, transported.

690
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:38,666
It isn't physically possible.

691
00:48:40,376 --> 00:48:43,004
You'd be surprised
what's physically possible.

692
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,513
The clock's running.

693
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:49,473
26 minutes. After that,
we scratch 'em off one per minute.

694
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,534
Your attention, please!

695
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:08,322
Ladies and gentlemen,
it might interest you to know

696
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,865
the city of New York has agreed
to pay for your release.

697
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:17,963
As soon as the money gets here,
will you let us go?

698
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:20,174
Soon after.

699
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:25,554
Excuse me, sir. Would you mind
telling us how much you're getting?

700
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:27,431
Why is that of interest to you, sir?

701
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:30,719
Well, a person
likes to know his worth.

702
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:34,230
- One million dollars.
- That's not so terrific.

703
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:25,523
Pull your pants up, AI.
We're goin' downtown.

704
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,691
Totally out
of the question, Mr. LaSalle.

705
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,656
Nobody asked you.

706
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:34,915
Warren, for Pete's sake,
I'm sick as a goat. What's the point?

707
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:38,954
The point, for Pete's sake, is that
the mayor of the city of New York,

708
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,793
trailing by 22 points in all the polls,

709
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:44,630
cares enough about
18 citizens in jeopardy

710
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:47,295
to make a personal appearance
in their behalf.

711
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:52,592
You know what'll happen?
What always happens. I'll get booed.

712
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:55,136
- He's a very sick man.
- Will you let go of that!

713
00:50:57,846 --> 00:51:01,896
All you have to do is say a few words
to the hijackers over a bullhorn.

714
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,608
You make a dignified plea for mercy.

715
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:08,149
Warren, suppose the hijackers
start shootin' at me?

716
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:11,114
Will you stop!
They have no reason to shoot at you.

717
00:51:11,277 --> 00:51:14,656
Why? Do you think
they're from outta town?

718
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:18,709
Get dressed, Al. I'll do the jokes.

719
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,352
-  Hold your water, will ya?

720
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,988
All right, shut up
and I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

721
00:51:48,147 --> 00:51:50,275
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Now listen.

722
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:52,193
I want all trains...

723
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:56,364
Garber. Come in, Garber.
Come in, Garber.

724
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:59,374
- Who are we waitin' for, Z?
- Beats me.

725
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:02,207
How long's it take to get
all that money together?

726
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:05,339
We'll never make it.
The passengers are dead ducks.

727
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:07,920
- I wonder what that cop's thinkin'.
- What cop?

728
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:10,711
The one who's a hostage.
Shit, I'm glad it's not me.

729
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:13,381
- Where's that money?
- Wanna make yourself useful?

730
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:16,767
Get Personnel to get a list
of all motormen

731
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:19,553
discharged for cause
during the past ten years.

732
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,394
- What are you lookin' for?
- Somebody down there can drive a train.

733
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:24,479
You don't pick that up
watching Sesame Street.

734
00:52:24,642 --> 00:52:26,144
Tell 'em you want it today.

735
00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:43,202
Mr. Grey, can I have a word
with you, please?

736
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:46,873
Will you stop messing around
with that girl, Mr. Grey?

737
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:49,212
What are you talking about?
She's a 20-buck-a-trick hooker.

738
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:52,345
- Who's a 20-buck-a-trick hooker?
- Leave her alone.

739
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:54,722
Who are you to go around
callin' people "hooker?"

740
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,599
I can do this job and hump
that broad at the same time.

741
00:52:57,758 --> 00:53:01,934
Listen, you little prick! 20 bucks
wouldn't buy you a good-night kiss!

742
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:04,394
I'm giving you an order, Mr. Grey.

743
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:07,234
Blow it outta your ass,

744
00:53:07,393 --> 00:53:08,895
Colonel.

745
00:53:09,478 --> 00:53:13,779
You're talkin' to the wrong man.
I'm not your Mr. B-B-B-Brown.

746
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:16,865
I once had a man shot
for talking to me like that.

747
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:22,325
Well, that's the difference between us.
I've always done my own killin'.

748
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,213
Sure takin' a hell of a long time
in there.

749
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:33,844
It's a lot of money, Albert.

750
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:37,131
Think how many times you gotta wet
your thumb to count a million bucks.

751
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:54,106
Command Center calling 28th Street.
Come in, Inspector.

752
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:55,445
This is Daniels.

753
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:58,486
- Has the money left yet, Inspector?
- Not yet.

754
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:02,994
What are they waitin' for? For God's
sake, give 'em a goose, will ya?

755
00:54:03,157 --> 00:54:05,455
We're runnin' outta time!
We're runnin' outta time!

756
00:54:22,718 --> 00:54:24,311
Pelham, this is Command Center.

757
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:26,222
Come in, Pelham One Two Three.

758
00:54:28,724 --> 00:54:31,523
- This is Pelham One Two Three.
- This is Garber.

759
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:34,154
We're movin' a little slowly
at this end, Pelham.

760
00:54:34,313 --> 00:54:35,986
We need some more time.

761
00:54:36,899 --> 00:54:38,867
Sorry, no more time.

762
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:40,403
If you can just see your way...

763
00:54:40,569 --> 00:54:43,573
- Will you hold it down, Frank?
- I want a local sent around the loop

764
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:45,537
at South Ferry
and shot up the west side...

765
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:48,999
I said knock it off!
I'm tryin' to buy some time here!

766
00:54:49,161 --> 00:54:51,209
And I'm tryin' to run a railroad!

767
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:54,716
While you're playing grab-ass
with a bunch of friggin' pirates!

768
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:58,470
How about 15 more minutes, Pelham?
A lousy 15 minutes?

769
00:54:58,629 --> 00:54:59,630
Negative.

770
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:03,805
Ten minutes, then. What difference
can ten minutes make to you?

771
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:05,969
Negative.

772
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:14,399
- Anythin' wrong?
- Wanted more time.

773
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:18,407
- How much more?
- Just ten minutes.

774
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:21,739
- Guess that can't hurt anybody.
- I didn't give it to them.

775
00:55:21,902 --> 00:55:25,577
- Suppose they can't make it?
- Then we do what we said we'd do.

776
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:29,084
Maybe an hour isn't enough time.

777
00:55:29,243 --> 00:55:31,746
You know the system.
You give 'em an hour, they take an hour.

778
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:36,634
Give 'em two hours, they take two hours.
An hour is plenty of time, Mr. Green.

779
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:38,419
Yeah, but supposin' it isn't?

780
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:49,559
This is the borough commander.
Come in, Headquarters Charlie!

781
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:53,935
Aren't you guys movin' yet?
Do you know what the damn time is?

782
00:55:54,101 --> 00:55:56,570
We're still waitin' for the money, sir.

783
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:59,777
I'm warning you guys. If I don't
see your faces before the deadline,

784
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:02,614
- I don't wanna see them at all! Ever!
- Yes, sir.

785
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:04,862
I told you. it's gonna be our ass.

786
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:15,210
- This is a million dollars?
- It's what it buys. Not what it weighs.

787
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:03,880
Eight minutes. We're not gonna make it.

788
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:15,066
- Inspector, where are they now, please?
- Center Street, just north of Chambers.

789
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:19,357
That gives us seven minutes.
Not enough time, sir.

790
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:22,022
Even if they get to 28th Street on time,

791
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:23,862
we still gotta carry it
down track on foot.

792
00:57:24,024 --> 00:57:25,651
No way, sir.

793
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:31,994
I always wanted to do this.

794
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:34,034
Look, we're scarin' the shit
outta everybody.

795
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:35,248
Yeah, includin' me.

796
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:46,673
Pelham One Two Three, this is Garber.
Come in, Pelham One Two Three.

797
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:49,182
All right, Garber,
this is Pelham One Two Three.

798
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:51,969
The money's en route,
makin' pretty good time too,

799
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:54,513
but it won't get to you by 3:13.

800
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,899
I'm very sorry to hear that.

801
00:57:57,057 --> 00:57:59,151
Suppose we get it
to the entrance by then.

802
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:01,403
Will you change your deadline
from delivery to you

803
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:02,813
to arrival at 28th Street?

804
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:08,612
Would you do that at least? Do you
read me, Pelham, for cryin' out loud?

805
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:15,576
All right, Garber.
But no more concessions.

806
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:19,497
- Is that quite clear?
- Quite clear. Quite clear.

807
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:25,002
They bought it. If we get the money
to the station by 3:13 we'll be OK.

808
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,215
Good work, Garber.

809
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:30,220
Headquarters Charlie,
headin' north on Center Street...

810
00:58:30,382 --> 00:58:32,259
Keep it comin'.
You've got four minutes!

811
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:35,100
Yes, sir, we'll make it...
We'll never make it.

812
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:37,390
Sir, the mayor is on his way down.

813
00:58:37,556 --> 00:58:39,524
Terrific. We'll hold the crowd
till he gets here.

814
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:09,880
Mr. Green.

815
00:59:11,006 --> 00:59:12,223
Yes.

816
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,513
Coming up in one minute.

817
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:26,855
Have you decided which one
it's gonna be?

818
00:59:27,022 --> 00:59:29,116
Does that make any difference?

819
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:33,116
I guess not.

820
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:45,382
OK. 50 seconds and then
I'm gonna eliminate one.

821
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:52,677
Hello, Headquarters Charlie,
we're approaching Astor Place.

822
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:56,013
You've still got 28 blocks!
Floor the son of a bitch!

823
00:59:58,512 --> 01:00:00,389
- Look out!

824
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:11,658
Whaddaya mean, it's been wrecked?
We're outta time!

825
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:15,321
I know we're outta time.
Couldn't make it, that's all.

826
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:18,787
That's all? They're about
to shoot an innocent person!

827
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:22,704
If they know the truck is wrecked,
how can they expect us to be on time?

828
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:25,793
They don't know anythin' down there.
How can they know anything...

829
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:28,208
Holy mackerel, that's it.

830
01:00:29,251 --> 01:00:32,255
Pelham One Two Three, the money has
arrived. Repeat, the money has arrived.

831
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:38,269
Do you read me, Pelham One Two Three?
The money has arrived.

832
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:44,266
This is Pelham One Two Three.
You made it just in time, didn't you?

833
01:00:55,861 --> 01:00:57,829
Get it up there! Move!

834
01:01:02,868 --> 01:01:04,541
I hope it works.

835
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:13,132
Are you still there, Garber?

836
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:18,262
Still here. Tell me something, Pelham.

837
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:22,100
If we were a couple of seconds late, you
would've knocked off an innocent party?

838
01:01:22,262 --> 01:01:24,606
Affirmative. Now I'll give you
the instructions

839
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:26,107
for the delivery of the money.

840
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:29,110
As usual, you'll follow them
to the letter OK?

841
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:30,896
I got it. Go ahead.

842
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:34,824
- Two unarmed policemen...

843
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:36,276
Gesundheit.

844
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:40,622
Two unarmed policemen
will walk down the track.

845
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:42,953
One with the money,
the other with a torch,

846
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:46,586
which he will flash continuously
from side to side.

847
01:01:46,745 --> 01:01:49,749
When they reach the can
the rear door will be opened

848
01:01:49,915 --> 01:01:52,839
and the one with the money
will throw it onto the train.

849
01:01:53,001 --> 01:01:57,723
Then they will both turn and walk back
to 28th Street station. Acknowledge.

850
01:01:57,881 --> 01:02:00,054
-I got it. Is that all?
- That's all for now.

851
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:03,767
But keep in mind, won't you,
that the same ground rules apply.

852
01:02:03,929 --> 01:02:07,684
Any wrong move by anyone
and I kill a hostage.

853
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:09,442
Coulda guessed that part.

854
01:02:09,601 --> 01:02:12,480
You have got five minutes
to deliver this money.

855
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:15,240
You don't think
you're gonna get out, do ya?

856
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:17,992
It's now 3:14.

857
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:20,904
You've got till 3:19.
Over.

858
01:02:22,489 --> 01:02:23,866
Over. Bastard.

859
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:34,463
Well, it's about fuckin' time!

860
01:02:34,626 --> 01:02:37,300
You two! Get the money outta there!

861
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:40,762
Which one has the flashlight?
Then you carry the money.

862
01:02:40,924 --> 01:02:43,143
Gimme that paper.
You've got four minutes!

863
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:46,305
Never mind the goddamn salutes!
Just get goin'!

864
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:57,907
Jesus, it's the goddamn mayor.

865
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:03,947
- You get the feelin' we ain't alone?
- Whaddaya mean?

866
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:13,879
We got four sub-machine-guns in front
of us, and all these jokers behind us.

867
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,964
I feel like I'm walkin' into
the fuckin' OK Corral.

868
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:23,391
Pow!

869
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:25,727
Shit!

870
01:04:08,595 --> 01:04:10,689
Hold your fire, goddamnit!

871
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:12,599
- Quiet!

872
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:24,949
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. it's not too b-b-bad.

873
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:28,206
- I think it went right through.
- Move back, come on. Move back.

874
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:31,619
Hey! Give me that scarf.
Give me that scarf!

875
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:33,628
Keep quiet!

876
01:04:33,787 --> 01:04:38,167
- OK?
- Yeah. I don't feel p-pain too much.

877
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:40,631
-  How many shots?
-  Just one.

878
01:04:40,794 --> 01:04:45,265
The rest was me and then they answered.
I didn't see anybody, I just got mad.

879
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:46,390
Goddamnit!

880
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:48,096
Mr. Grey?

881
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:54,186
You don't think they're finished
out there, do ya?

882
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:58,190
Go back there and help Mr. Green,
will you, please?

883
01:05:00,355 --> 01:05:03,700
Some girl-scout
chickenshit outfit I'm in, here.

884
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:10,415
I suppose somebody out there
got nervous or bored.

885
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:12,371
Been there a long time.

886
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:15,419
Can't afford to let it pass.

887
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:22,051
Who started it?
Who Fred first? Them or us?

888
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:26,761
I don't know, Lieutenant. It came from
somewhere behind me in the dark.

889
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:28,766
It had to be one of the snipers.

890
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:31,769
Somebody just took it in his head
to fire on his own?

891
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:35,398
- How could he do such a thing?
- Easy, Lieutenant.

892
01:05:35,557 --> 01:05:37,355
Real easy.

893
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:39,519
Can you see what's goin' on
inside the train?

894
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:44,031
No, not too good. I'd sure hate
to be in there findin' out.

895
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:56,870
Conductor.

896
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:05,922
- You mean me?
- Yes. Stand up and come down here.

897
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:09,057
- Why, what are you gonna do?
- Something you can help me with.

898
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:13,561
- Come on. Come down here.
- Look, if he doesn't wanna go...

899
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:17,816
All right, everybody. Just get back
on your seats. Very quietly.

900
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:21,444
Come on. Back on your seats.

901
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:25,324
All right, conductor. I want you to
walk up track about a hundred feet.

902
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:27,860
Just wait for the men delivering
the money, all right?

903
01:06:29,444 --> 01:06:30,821
I'll open the door for you.

904
01:06:33,281 --> 01:06:34,954
- Why do I have to go?
- Come on, come on.

905
01:06:36,201 --> 01:06:38,920
-  Here, I'll help you down.

906
01:06:40,288 --> 01:06:43,383
Come on. Please go.
There's nothing to worry about.

907
01:06:46,461 --> 01:06:48,964
Look! Somebody's climbin' down!

908
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:57,805
Christ, he's comin' this way!

909
01:07:01,768 --> 01:07:03,941
-  Oh, no!

910
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:14,952
What?

911
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:16,411
What are you talking about, Rico?

912
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:18,952
Why would they shoot a hostage?
We're still under the deadline.

913
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:22,213
- Somebody threw a shot at them.
- Who the hell was it?

914
01:07:22,372 --> 01:07:24,841
Nobody knows. My bet is we never will.

915
01:07:24,999 --> 01:07:27,969
Z, when are we gonna hear
from that cop who's on board?

916
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:32,177
What do you want, Rico? A suicide?
There's heavily armed men down there.

917
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:35,264
What chance has one lousy cop got,
especially if it's a dame?

918
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:38,893
Boy, what a mess!

919
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:45,695
Pelham One Two Three, come in.
This is Garber.

920
01:07:45,853 --> 01:07:48,402
Here is Pelham One Two Three.
Come in, Garber.

921
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:51,409
For Christ's sake, fella,
did ya have to do it?

922
01:07:51,568 --> 01:07:54,822
One of my men was fired at.
I warned you what the penalty would be.

923
01:07:54,988 --> 01:07:57,616
- Yeah, you warned me.
-  Where's the money?

924
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:01,832
I'm going to give you 30 seconds more.

925
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:12,885
Hey, you guys!

926
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:17,518
- Christ, who's that?
- Transit cop. I got orders for you.

927
01:08:17,677 --> 01:08:20,180
Resume delivery on the double.

928
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:22,724
I don't suppose we could
have that in writin'?

929
01:08:31,691 --> 01:08:33,614
Mr. Blue, we got a light!

930
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:51,924
All right. Open the door,
would you, Mr. Brown?

931
01:08:53,171 --> 01:08:57,051
All right, gentlemen.
Hands in evidence, please.

932
01:08:57,216 --> 01:08:58,388
Put up your hands!

933
01:09:03,056 --> 01:09:05,479
All right. Throw the money up here.

934
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:08,653
Into the cab.

935
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:10,063
Push it up.

936
01:09:11,522 --> 01:09:14,901
Thank you. Now turn around.

937
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:20,908
Go home to your wives and children.
Keep the hands up. Take it very easily.

938
01:09:21,074 --> 01:09:23,372
Shut the door, Mr. Brown, will you?

939
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:38,800
- Oh...

940
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:42,557
Mr. Grey.

941
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:48,268
-  Jesus H. Christ!

942
01:09:49,811 --> 01:09:52,064
I've never seen a million dollars
in my life before.

943
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:55,029
You can load up first, Mr. Grey.

944
01:09:58,027 --> 01:09:59,904
I'll talk to Garber.

945
01:10:00,071 --> 01:10:02,995
All that money! I can't believe it!

946
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:05,125
I'm gonna die today.

947
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:07,787
Well... either you live or you die.

948
01:10:10,373 --> 01:10:12,876
- That's 18 packs each, right?
- Right.

949
01:10:28,141 --> 01:10:30,235
This is Pelham One Two Three.
Do you read me, Garber?

950
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:35,277
- This is Garber. Go ahead.
- I'm gonna give you three instructions.

951
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:38,159
Each one is to be followed precisely.
ls that clear?

952
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:39,409
So far.

953
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:42,830
One, at the end of this conversation,

954
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:45,242
you will restore power
to the entire sector.

955
01:10:46,868 --> 01:10:48,370
Right. Restore power. Go ahead.

956
01:10:49,412 --> 01:10:53,667
Two, you will clear the local track all
the way from 28th Street to South Ferry.

957
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:57,383
By clear I mean switches properly set,
all signals green.

958
01:10:57,545 --> 01:10:59,297
I emphasize green, Garber.

959
01:10:59,464 --> 01:11:02,809
If I so much as see a red light,
let alone get tripped by one,

960
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:04,514
I'll shoot another hostage.

961
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:17,106
You will also remove
all police from the tunnel.

962
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:20,368
If I see a policeman
between here and South Ferry,

963
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:21,698
I'll shoot another hostage.

964
01:11:21,861 --> 01:11:24,364
Any deviation,
I'll shoot another hostage.

965
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:26,828
Listen, fella, I hope you take this
in the right spirit,

966
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:29,494
but after this is over
you should seek psychiatric help.

967
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:33,881
Let me know when all my points have
been complied with. Over and out.

968
01:11:36,918 --> 01:11:39,842
- Rico, are you there?
- I'm here, Z. What's up?

969
01:11:40,004 --> 01:11:42,098
Hold on while I cut in the city cops.

970
01:11:43,216 --> 01:11:45,310
Frank, hook me up and get outta there.

971
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:48,893
What a way to run a railroad!

972
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:54,102
- Inspector Daniels. This is Garber.
- This is Daniels.

973
01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:58,273
Inspector, I have Lieutenant Patrone
of the Transit Police on the line.

974
01:11:58,439 --> 01:12:00,362
I have the latest instructions
from the hijackers.

975
01:12:00,525 --> 01:12:03,324
They want power restored,
all tracks cleared,

976
01:12:03,486 --> 01:12:07,116
signals green to South Ferry,
and no cops anywhere in sight.

977
01:12:07,281 --> 01:12:11,081
OK, sir, so we go along with that.
We have to. But then what?

978
01:12:11,244 --> 01:12:13,747
- What do you think they got in mind?
- Beats me, Z.

979
01:12:13,913 --> 01:12:16,257
I wouldn't have picked a tunnel
for my getaway.

980
01:12:16,415 --> 01:12:18,258
But they did pick it.

981
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:22,843
And since everything they've done has
been worked out to the smallest detail,

982
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:25,849
it stands to reason
they got the rest worked out, too.

983
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:29,103
Power restored and track cleared.
But why South Ferry?

984
01:12:29,262 --> 01:12:33,893
Well, do you think it's the water, Rico?
Maybe they got a boat in the harbor.

985
01:12:34,058 --> 01:12:36,857
I don't know. We'd better play it
one step at a time.

986
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:39,442
Garber; you see about
restorin' the power.

987
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:42,700
I'll start pullin' our units
out of the tunnel.

988
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:47,205
We can follow them on the street.
Except how do we know where they'll be?

989
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:49,866
Grand Central Tower
has 'em on their model board.

990
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:51,375
We can see every move they make.

991
01:12:51,534 --> 01:12:54,253
They stop any place before South Ferry,
we know about it.

992
01:12:54,412 --> 01:12:55,914
I'll check in when I get to my car.

993
01:12:56,539 --> 01:12:59,509
Wait, I just figured out
how they're gonna get away.

994
01:12:59,667 --> 01:13:02,796
- I'm listenin'.
- They're gonna fly the train to Cuba.

995
01:13:05,256 --> 01:13:06,724
You're a sick man, Rico.

996
01:13:06,883 --> 01:13:11,309
Whaddaya want me to do?
The power's still off! Move 'em by bus!

997
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:14,269
What do you mean you haven't got
any buses? Go out and hijack some!

998
01:13:14,432 --> 01:13:17,811
Hey, Garber, what's goin' on?
Do I get my trains back now or don't I?

999
01:13:18,811 --> 01:13:20,813
You don't. Not yet.

1000
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:23,654
Do you realize the goddamn
rush hour starts in an hour?

1001
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:27,286
Will you shut up and listen?
I got a new set of instructions.

1002
01:13:27,445 --> 01:13:29,743
I don't give a rat's ass
for your fuckin' instructions!

1003
01:13:29,906 --> 01:13:32,204
I'm not liftin' a finger to help
the killers of Caz Dolowicz.

1004
01:13:37,705 --> 01:13:39,002
Hey!

1005
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:42,169
Now you listen to me,
you dumb son of a bitch.

1006
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:43,632
If you don't do what I tell you,

1007
01:13:43,794 --> 01:13:46,388
you'll be havin'
dinner tonight with Caz Dolowicz!

1008
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:48,094
Jesus Christ, what are you...!

1009
01:13:56,015 --> 01:13:57,016
OK.

1010
01:13:58,392 --> 01:13:59,814
Better take the case out.

1011
01:14:07,026 --> 01:14:10,200
All right, ladies and gentlemen.
Pay attention, please.

1012
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:12,832
In a while we hope to be moving again.

1013
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:16,039
Then, with a bit of luck,
you'll all be released unharmed.

1014
01:14:16,202 --> 01:14:18,955
Until then, of course,
you'll continue to obey my orders.

1015
01:14:20,206 --> 01:14:22,208
Thank you for your cooperation.

1016
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:23,672
Hey, dude.

1017
01:14:25,628 --> 01:14:29,883
As you're goin' downtown anyway, you
mind droppin' me off at Fulton Street?

1018
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:33,098
You're a wise mother, you know that?
How'd you like some more?

1019
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:38,395
This'll give 'em a jolt,
even before they expected it.

1020
01:14:38,724 --> 01:14:41,352
-  Look at this.
- Holy Christ, she's movin'.

1021
01:14:41,519 --> 01:14:44,989
They promised to wait until
we cleared track all the way down.

1022
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:47,445
Jenkins, get Command Center.

1023
01:14:47,608 --> 01:14:50,077
Grand Central Tower,
callin' Command Center.

1024
01:14:50,236 --> 01:14:52,864
- This is Command Center.
- She's movin'.

1025
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:55,453
- Who's movin'?
- Pelham One Two Three.

1026
01:14:55,616 --> 01:14:57,539
What? Since when?

1027
01:14:57,702 --> 01:14:59,079
Just started.

1028
01:14:59,245 --> 01:15:01,088
Hold on. I'll put ya on a tie-in.

1029
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:04,004
Rico, she's movin '.

1030
01:15:06,252 --> 01:15:09,096
- Who's movin'?
- Who do ya think? Pelham.

1031
01:15:09,255 --> 01:15:13,135
- it's too soon. We're not set up yet.
- You heard from Daniels yet?

1032
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:15,894
He's in a squad car
on Park Avenue South.

1033
01:15:16,887 --> 01:15:19,640
-  Inspector? She's movin', sir.
- Who's movin'?

1034
01:15:21,225 --> 01:15:24,320
What's the matter with everybody?
How many hijacked trains we got?

1035
01:15:24,937 --> 01:15:28,567
They're not supposed to do that yet.
How far have they gone?

1036
01:15:28,733 --> 01:15:33,409
- Grand Central? How far have they gone?
- Comin' up on 23rd Street.

1037
01:15:33,571 --> 01:15:35,198
Better move those cops
off the platform.

1038
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:38,038
Better follow along down Park Avenue.

1039
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:39,292
Get me 23rd Street.

1040
01:15:39,452 --> 01:15:41,546
Comin' in to 23rd Street.

1041
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:44,753
All right. Steady as she goes now.

1042
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:08,322
Garber? Just had a terrible thought.
Suppose they're not on the train?

1043
01:16:08,481 --> 01:16:10,154
What if they set the throttle
and jumped off?

1044
01:16:10,316 --> 01:16:14,287
While we're chasin' the train, they're
sneakin' out somewhere behind us.

1045
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:17,415
Ingenious, sir, except it's impossible.

1046
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:21,544
- Why?
- A gizmo known as a deadman's feature.

1047
01:16:21,702 --> 01:16:25,627
It's built into the control handle
in case the motorman drops dead.

1048
01:16:25,790 --> 01:16:30,261
The handle has to have a man's hand
pressing down on it, hard, at all times.

1049
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:33,172
Otherwise the thing don't work.
The train stops cold.

1050
01:16:33,339 --> 01:16:34,682
Ah, I see.

1051
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:39,346
Nice try, though. I'll give 'em a call
in case you're still worried about it.

1052
01:16:39,512 --> 01:16:43,483
Pelham One Two Three,
what's goin' on down there?

1053
01:16:43,641 --> 01:16:46,520
The tracks aren't cleared yet.
How come you're movin'?

1054
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:49,404
We're trying to put some
distance between us

1055
01:16:49,563 --> 01:16:52,863
and all those policemen
you've got hidden back there.

1056
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:55,574
If you keep moving, you're gonna
run into a lot of red signals.

1057
01:16:55,736 --> 01:16:58,956
- I don't want you to blame us for it.
- l won't blame you for anything.

1058
01:16:59,115 --> 01:17:02,870
Just let us know when you've
cleared the track. OK, signing off.

1059
01:17:03,035 --> 01:17:05,163
Do you think he's able
to figure anything out?

1060
01:17:06,205 --> 01:17:08,799
I mean, all those questions.

1061
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:11,711
Not surprising under
the circumstances, is it?

1062
01:17:13,003 --> 01:17:15,347
They're thinking what
we want them to think.

1063
01:17:15,506 --> 01:17:17,008
Ah, there it is.

1064
01:17:17,967 --> 01:17:21,437
OK. Stop a few yards past it, will you?

1065
01:17:21,595 --> 01:17:22,596
All right.

1066
01:17:26,517 --> 01:17:28,815
- Thank you, Mr. Green.

1067
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:34,901
He shutdown again. Pass it along.

1068
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:38,162
Grand Central Tower callin' Command
Center. Come in, Command Center.

1069
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:40,990
Command Center.

1070
01:17:41,157 --> 01:17:44,582
She stopped again, Lieutenant.
Below 18th Street station.

1071
01:17:44,743 --> 01:17:46,040
Got ya. Thanks.

1072
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:49,882
Inspector, they stopped again.
Where are you?

1073
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:53,465
- Approachin' 17th Street.
- Pull over. You're right above them.

1074
01:17:53,627 --> 01:17:55,345
And then what?

1075
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:57,677
It's up to them.
I'll get back to you, sir.

1076
01:18:08,392 --> 01:18:11,737
Pelham One Two Three. Cal/in'
Pelham One Two Three. Come in, please.

1077
01:18:14,773 --> 01:18:17,196
Pelham One Two Three,
Pelham One Two Three,

1078
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:19,532
this is Command Center.
Come in.

1079
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:21,038
Quick as you can.

1080
01:18:22,323 --> 01:18:25,793
Pelham One Two Three.
This is Garber. Come in, please.

1081
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:27,248
Come in, please.

1082
01:18:29,788 --> 01:18:32,337
What the hell's goin' on out there?

1083
01:18:32,499 --> 01:18:35,469
- Who s-s-said you could talk?

1084
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:42,226
Pelham One Two Three, come in. Pelham
One Two Three, why don't you answer?

1085
01:18:43,802 --> 01:18:46,476
Frank, how long before
the track's cleared?

1086
01:18:46,639 --> 01:18:48,186
You mean before this railroad
is so fucked

1087
01:18:48,349 --> 01:18:51,944
- it'll take a computer to put it back?
- Yes, Frank, that's what I meant.

1088
01:18:53,354 --> 01:18:56,984
About five or six minutes.
I got a snag at Brooklyn Bridge.

1089
01:18:58,442 --> 01:19:01,491
- There's somethin' goin' on down there.
- Whaddaya think?

1090
01:19:01,654 --> 01:19:03,998
I don't have the slightest idea.

1091
01:19:05,324 --> 01:19:08,749
Listen Rico, I don't care what those
clowns said, I want men on every...

1092
01:19:08,911 --> 01:19:10,379
Wait a minute. Hold on a second.

1093
01:19:11,372 --> 01:19:12,339
Inspector Daniels?

1094
01:19:12,498 --> 01:19:14,592
I think we need officers
on every platform

1095
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,673
from 14th Street to South Ferry.

1096
01:19:16,835 --> 01:19:18,837
That's a good idea, Lieutenant. Will do.

1097
01:19:19,004 --> 01:19:21,473
I'll come up to 17th Street and join ya.

1098
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:25,473
Rico, how you coming along with
that list of motormen?

1099
01:19:25,636 --> 01:19:27,980
They're workin' on it.
I told 'em to rush it.

1100
01:19:28,138 --> 01:19:30,186
Come up here and take over
the radio for me.

1101
01:19:30,349 --> 01:19:32,852
But don't tell 'em the track's clear
until you hear from me.

1102
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:35,362
I don't want them startin' again
until I get there.

1103
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:36,693
Will do, Z.

1104
01:20:26,613 --> 01:20:29,082
- Inspector Daniels?
- Daniels.

1105
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:33,670
Oh, I, uh... I thought you
were a, uh... like a shorter guy.

1106
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:35,502
I don't know what I thought.

1107
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:39,509
- Anythin' happenin'?
- They're still down there.

1108
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:42,592
If this street collapsed,
we'd land right on top of 'em.

1109
01:20:42,755 --> 01:20:45,099
Command Center
to DCI, Manhattan.

1110
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:48,310
Yeah, Rico, this is Garber.

1111
01:20:48,469 --> 01:20:52,144
Track's been cleared for two minutes.
Do you want me to call the hijackers?

1112
01:20:52,306 --> 01:20:56,777
Yeah, let 'em know. And let us know
when they start movin', will ya?

1113
01:20:56,935 --> 01:21:01,156
What do we do? If they pick up speed
on us we'll have trouble keepin' up.

1114
01:21:01,315 --> 01:21:04,489
I think we oughta take off.
Get a jump on them for a change.

1115
01:21:04,651 --> 01:21:05,652
Move it.

1116
01:21:07,196 --> 01:21:09,540
Tell the sergeant to hold
the men here until further word.

1117
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:10,699
Yes, sir.

1118
01:21:15,496 --> 01:21:16,964
Fits like a glove.

1119
01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:19,341
- ls it gonna come away clean?
- It's gonna work all right.

1120
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:23,471
Command Center to
Pelham One Two Three.

1121
01:21:23,629 --> 01:21:25,973
- Who's that?
- Give me the mike.

1122
01:21:29,343 --> 01:21:32,313
- Here.
- This is Pelham.

1123
01:21:32,471 --> 01:21:36,647
- What happened to Garber?
- Even great men have to pee.

1124
01:21:36,809 --> 01:21:39,733
Just letting you know the track's
cleared all the way to South Ferry.

1125
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:43,069
Thank you.
Give the lieutenant my regards.

1126
01:21:43,232 --> 01:21:46,361
- Do it yourself, at the arraignment.
- Over and out.

1127
01:21:46,527 --> 01:21:48,120
Best get going.

1128
01:21:48,278 --> 01:21:49,279
All right, Mr. Brown.

1129
01:21:59,081 --> 01:22:03,382
You will all remain seated.
That means nobody is to get up.

1130
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:06,755
OK.

1131
01:22:14,221 --> 01:22:17,020
- Now what?
- Me you're askin'?

1132
01:22:39,663 --> 01:22:41,210
OK. Come on.

1133
01:22:45,878 --> 01:22:48,006
- Hey, where are you goin'?!

1134
01:22:48,172 --> 01:22:49,970
I'm a police officer!

1135
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:57,644
- Mr. Blue?
- Yeah, what do you want?

1136
01:22:57,806 --> 01:23:00,275
I thought I saw somethin' f-f-fall off.

1137
01:23:00,434 --> 01:23:01,651
What do you mean, something?

1138
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:05,485
- Might've been a person. I ain't sure.
- All right, let's make sure.

1139
01:23:07,232 --> 01:23:10,031
No, we haven't got time.
Get back up here. Come on.

1140
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:22,457
Command Center,
Pelham One Two Three's in motion!

1141
01:23:39,097 --> 01:23:41,976
Where do you think
they're takin' us now?!

1142
01:23:42,142 --> 01:23:44,520
Don't worry,
they're gonna let us all go!

1143
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:46,108
How do you know that?!

1144
01:23:46,271 --> 01:23:49,320
They got the money!
They got what they want!

1145
01:23:53,237 --> 01:23:57,083
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Can't anybody count?

1146
01:23:57,241 --> 01:23:58,834
They all four got off!

1147
01:24:00,244 --> 01:24:03,214
There's nobody drivin'
the fuckin' train!

1148
01:24:10,587 --> 01:24:11,679
Anybody in there?!

1149
01:24:21,807 --> 01:24:23,809
All right, all clear.

1150
01:24:23,976 --> 01:24:26,855
All right, then. You know the drill.

1151
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:29,239
We do it by the numbers. Hats.

1152
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:36,238
- Glasses.
- Drills and numbers...

1153
01:24:36,405 --> 01:24:39,158
This is all chickenshit.
Why don't we just do it?

1154
01:24:39,324 --> 01:24:40,621
Moustaches.

1155
01:24:53,839 --> 01:24:55,591
All right, reverse coats.

1156
01:25:07,686 --> 01:25:11,862
Pelham One Two Three 's between Astor
Place and Bleecker. Speed's increasing.

1157
01:25:12,357 --> 01:25:16,863
Pelham One Two Three now
between Astor Place and Bleecker.

1158
01:25:17,029 --> 01:25:22,286
Doesn't make any sense. They know
we're monitoring their position.

1159
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:23,998
- So?
- So it's dumb.

1160
01:25:24,161 --> 01:25:26,004
Huh, who said crooks were smart?

1161
01:25:26,163 --> 01:25:30,418
But these have been smart.
We're overlookin' somethin', Inspector.

1162
01:25:30,917 --> 01:25:33,591
OK. New hats.

1163
01:25:42,888 --> 01:25:46,017
OK. Magazines in pockets.

1164
01:25:50,228 --> 01:25:52,230
I never knew these things went so fast!

1165
01:25:52,397 --> 01:25:54,070
We're gonna be killed!

1166
01:25:54,232 --> 01:25:59,204
- Stop it! Nobody's gonna get killed!
- A hell of a lot you know, old man!

1167
01:25:59,363 --> 01:26:03,413
But I do know! I've been ridin' the
subways since before you were born!

1168
01:26:03,575 --> 01:26:08,923
I'm an expert. You see, they have
something called stoppers,

1169
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:11,459
or stickers, or something like that.

1170
01:26:11,625 --> 01:26:16,222
And whenever a train goes by
a red light, these things stop them.

1171
01:26:16,380 --> 01:26:19,259
- There's just one thing, baby!
- What's that?

1172
01:26:19,424 --> 01:26:21,267
They're all green!

1173
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:34,448
Inspector, that short move they made
between 28th Street and 17th Street.

1174
01:26:34,606 --> 01:26:37,780
- Why'd they do that?
- I don't know.

1175
01:26:37,943 --> 01:26:40,162
Suppose they wanted to do somethin'

1176
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:42,789
they didn't want anybody else
to know about?

1177
01:26:42,948 --> 01:26:46,543
- Like what?
- Like jumpin' off the train.

1178
01:26:46,702 --> 01:26:48,955
Turn around.
We're goin' back to 17th Street.

1179
01:26:49,121 --> 01:26:50,088
Like hell we are!

1180
01:26:50,247 --> 01:26:52,295
They are not on the train.
I'm sure of it.

1181
01:26:52,457 --> 01:26:55,711
I suggested that in the first place.
You shot me down.

1182
01:26:55,877 --> 01:26:59,177
- Something about a deadman's feature?
- They fiigured out how to beat that!

1183
01:26:59,339 --> 01:27:01,888
That's their plan!
That's what they started with!

1184
01:27:03,635 --> 01:27:05,103
Turn this thing around and burn rubber.

1185
01:27:11,518 --> 01:27:13,111
Guns to Mr. Brown.

1186
01:27:20,068 --> 01:27:24,323
Mr. Grey, would you be good enough
to give that gun to Mr. Brown, please?

1187
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:27,709
No. This ain't gonna go nowhere.
This is gonna stay with me.

1188
01:27:31,288 --> 01:27:33,916
Mr. Grey, bring that gun back here,
please.

1189
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:39,179
What if they're waitin' for us up there?
I want some heavy artillery with me.

1190
01:27:39,337 --> 01:27:43,888
- Mr. Grey, I won't ask you again.
- Blow it outta your ass, Mr. Blue.

1191
01:27:52,642 --> 01:27:54,565
Oh, my God.

1192
01:27:57,189 --> 01:27:58,406
Let's get his money!

1193
01:28:01,318 --> 01:28:03,070
Mr. Green, come on!

1194
01:28:57,082 --> 01:28:58,208
Mr. Blue!

1195
01:28:59,543 --> 01:29:00,669
Did you get him?

1196
01:29:02,462 --> 01:29:04,464
You go on ahead.

1197
01:29:04,631 --> 01:29:07,134
We'll meet where we planned. Right?

1198
01:29:17,185 --> 01:29:19,279
You better be right about this, Garber.

1199
01:29:19,437 --> 01:29:21,815
Well, even if I am,
it's probably too late.

1200
01:29:48,133 --> 01:29:50,101
Where are those goddamn red lights?!

1201
01:30:00,770 --> 01:30:02,238
We're not stopping!

1202
01:30:02,397 --> 01:30:05,241
There is going to be a red light!
There has to be!

1203
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:08,825
- What if there isn't?!
- There has to be!

1204
01:30:32,385 --> 01:30:34,012
Check the emergency exits!

1205
01:30:34,179 --> 01:30:37,809
Inspector, you take 15th Street.
Officer, you take 17th Street.

1206
01:30:37,974 --> 01:30:39,066
Right, sir.

1207
01:31:05,877 --> 01:31:07,675
Are you a policeman?

1208
01:31:09,839 --> 01:31:14,845
Well done. The mayor
will go to your funeral.

1209
01:31:15,011 --> 01:31:19,141
Excuse me, fella,
would you mind droppin' that gun?

1210
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:20,433
Drop it!

1211
01:31:35,031 --> 01:31:38,752
Officer, I suppose you couldn't use

1212
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:41,459
a quarter of a million dollars,
could you?

1213
01:31:41,621 --> 01:31:43,749
Quarter of a million? No, thanks.

1214
01:31:43,915 --> 01:31:47,715
My accountant says I've accepted
enough for this fiscal quarter.

1215
01:31:51,089 --> 01:31:53,387
You're the English guy on the radio.

1216
01:31:53,550 --> 01:31:54,551
Yes.

1217
01:31:56,136 --> 01:31:59,515
- Lieutenant Garber?
- Right. Do you wanna move along?

1218
01:32:00,682 --> 01:32:06,064
Excuse me... Do you people
still execute in this state?

1219
01:32:06,229 --> 01:32:09,529
What? Oh, execute.
No. Not at the moment.

1220
01:32:09,691 --> 01:32:10,943
Pity.

1221
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:40,438
Christ.

1222
01:32:56,279 --> 01:33:00,284
We'll have an ambulance here in no time,
miss. Everything's gonna be OK.

1223
01:33:07,499 --> 01:33:09,843
Where are those goddamn red lights?!

1224
01:33:10,668 --> 01:33:12,170
Oh, God!

1225
01:33:12,337 --> 01:33:15,967
Stop!

1226
01:33:22,347 --> 01:33:23,849
There has to be.

1227
01:33:26,184 --> 01:33:28,061
it's headin'
to the South Ferry loop!

1228
01:33:28,228 --> 01:33:30,196
It must be goin' about 70mph!

1229
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:37,954
My God! Look!

1230
01:33:40,281 --> 01:33:41,783
We'll never make it!

1231
01:34:16,484 --> 01:34:19,408
I told you it would stop. Didn't I?

1232
01:34:23,158 --> 01:34:25,627
42nd Street already?

1233
01:34:26,411 --> 01:34:29,881
Get that list out on the wire.
Tell 'em it's top priority.

1234
01:34:30,039 --> 01:34:31,165
Whaddaya got, Rico?

1235
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:35,845
We got positive identification
on the three dead men. Here.

1236
01:34:39,257 --> 01:34:42,261
George Steever. Professional guy, huh?

1237
01:34:42,427 --> 01:34:45,271
- St Louis.
- Yeah, I know how to read, Rico.

1238
01:34:46,389 --> 01:34:50,110
Giuseppe Benvenuto,
alias...  Joe Welcome.

1239
01:34:50,268 --> 01:34:52,987
- Where's the guy who fried himself?
-  No card on him.

1240
01:34:53,146 --> 01:34:55,945
We got a confirm on his prints
from Immigration.

1241
01:34:56,107 --> 01:35:01,580
Name's Bernard Ryder. Mercenary
soldier. Between wars, I guess.

1242
01:35:01,738 --> 01:35:03,786
None of these guys
know how to drive a train.

1243
01:35:03,948 --> 01:35:06,292
It means it's the motorman
who's missin'.

1244
01:35:06,451 --> 01:35:09,705
Did you get that list of motormen
who were discharged?

1245
01:35:09,871 --> 01:35:11,965
Yeah. 78 names.

1246
01:35:12,123 --> 01:35:13,295
78?

1247
01:35:13,458 --> 01:35:15,586
Yeah, but it's not that bad.

1248
01:35:15,752 --> 01:35:18,471
Eight are dead. 22 were rehired.

1249
01:35:18,630 --> 01:35:19,973
11 are in jail.

1250
01:35:21,883 --> 01:35:24,477
26 moved away.

1251
01:35:24,636 --> 01:35:28,686
One's in a mental institution. Another
is a member of the Police Department.

1252
01:35:28,848 --> 01:35:30,600
That's our man right there.

1253
01:35:31,643 --> 01:35:35,273
Sorry to disappoint you, Zachary,
but he was accounted for.

1254
01:35:35,438 --> 01:35:38,362
- So how many does that leave?
- Only nine.

1255
01:35:38,524 --> 01:35:41,824
Only nine. All right, let's get goin'.

1256
01:35:44,405 --> 01:35:46,874
What's the name of this guy?

1257
01:35:47,033 --> 01:35:48,660
Nathaniel Muscat.

1258
01:35:50,036 --> 01:35:52,164
- What'd he get busted for?
- Narcotics.

1259
01:36:00,213 --> 01:36:01,260
This way.

1260
01:36:12,058 --> 01:36:15,107
-  Who's there?
- Transit Police.

1261
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:16,738
Just a minute.

1262
01:36:20,817 --> 01:36:22,069
What do you want?

1263
01:36:26,614 --> 01:36:28,867
Uh, nothin', fella. Our mistake.

1264
01:36:30,618 --> 01:36:33,041
A spokesman
for the Transit Authority

1265
01:36:33,204 --> 01:36:35,582
noted that the subway car
carrying the hostages

1266
01:36:35,748 --> 01:36:40,174
was stopped at the South Ferry loop
by the automatic safety features

1267
01:36:40,336 --> 01:36:43,886
which are activated by any car
travelling at excessive speed.

1268
01:36:44,048 --> 01:36:47,894
- Transit Authority.
- Still gotta pay.

1269
01:36:48,344 --> 01:36:50,472
- Your name is Latimer?
- What about it?

1270
01:36:50,638 --> 01:36:53,016
Just answer the question, would ya?

1271
01:36:53,182 --> 01:36:57,688
I don't work for you guys anymore.
You don't get shit from me.

1272
01:36:59,105 --> 01:37:03,076
Can you account for your
whereabouts today, Mr. Latimer?

1273
01:37:03,234 --> 01:37:07,080
Are you tryin' to connect me
to that hijacking? Forget it!

1274
01:37:07,238 --> 01:37:09,661
I've been here since 2:30
this afternoon.

1275
01:37:09,824 --> 01:37:13,124
- Are you sure?
- Sure? Ask anybody!

1276
01:37:13,286 --> 01:37:16,165
- Don't worry, we will.
- Hold it!

1277
01:37:16,331 --> 01:37:18,425
It's still gonna be 50 cents.

1278
01:37:41,939 --> 01:37:44,192
- Who's that?
-  Police Department.

1279
01:37:44,359 --> 01:37:45,326
Who?

1280
01:37:45,485 --> 01:37:48,034
Harold Longman,
it's the Transit Police.

1281
01:37:48,196 --> 01:37:49,789
Oh, Jesus!

1282
01:37:50,615 --> 01:37:51,707
Wait a minute!

1283
01:37:56,662 --> 01:37:57,663
Just a minute!

1284
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:06,886
- How many more we gotta see today?
- Six, seven. I don't know.

1285
01:38:11,094 --> 01:38:13,563
Come on, Mr. Longman,
we ain't got all night!

1286
01:38:18,768 --> 01:38:21,146
- I'll be right out!

1287
01:38:22,939 --> 01:38:25,658
I hope he washes his hands
before he opens the door.

1288
01:38:34,325 --> 01:38:36,669
- Yes, what is it?
- Harold Longman?

1289
01:38:36,828 --> 01:38:38,671
We'd like to ask
a couple of questions.

1290
01:38:38,830 --> 01:38:39,831
What about?

1291
01:38:39,997 --> 01:38:41,044
Will you let us in?

1292
01:38:41,207 --> 01:38:43,676
We'll just take one minute
of your time.

1293
01:38:46,754 --> 01:38:49,007
I'm Lieutenant Patrone.
This is Lieutenant Garber.

1294
01:38:49,173 --> 01:38:51,517
How do you do?
I'm sorry to bother you like this.

1295
01:38:53,386 --> 01:38:56,560
- Nice place you got here, Mr. Longman.
- Thanks.

1296
01:38:57,849 --> 01:39:01,103
Can you give us an account of
your whereabouts this afternoon?

1297
01:39:01,269 --> 01:39:02,236
Why?

1298
01:39:02,395 --> 01:39:04,523
- Were you at work?
- No.

1299
01:39:04,689 --> 01:39:07,442
- Why not?
- I work nights.

1300
01:39:07,608 --> 01:39:10,578
- Where do you work?
- Kennedy Airport.

1301
01:39:10,736 --> 01:39:14,957
- What do you do over there?
- I'm a... fork-lift operator.

1302
01:39:15,116 --> 01:39:17,995
Oh, I got a brother-in-law does that
over in Jersey.

1303
01:39:18,161 --> 01:39:20,209
That's interesting work.

1304
01:39:20,371 --> 01:39:23,295
What, uh... Where were you
this afternoon, Mr. Longman?

1305
01:39:23,458 --> 01:39:26,883
- Why?
- You tell me where, I'll tell you why.

1306
01:39:27,044 --> 01:39:29,513
I was, uh... right here.

1307
01:39:29,672 --> 01:39:31,390
Can anyone verify that fact?

1308
01:39:34,677 --> 01:39:37,271
You said you'd tell me why.

1309
01:39:37,430 --> 01:39:41,401
-  You were here all afternoon?
- I sleep in the afternoon.

1310
01:39:41,559 --> 01:39:45,564
- All afternoon?
- Well... till about an hour ago.

1311
01:39:48,566 --> 01:39:51,991
- But you heard about the hijacking?
- What hijacking?

1312
01:39:52,153 --> 01:39:54,952
- The subway train.
- Subway...

1313
01:39:56,073 --> 01:39:59,998
- You gotta be kiddin'!
- Do I look like I'm kiddin'?

1314
01:40:00,161 --> 01:40:03,040
I mean, would I be here
if I was kiddin', mister?

1315
01:40:03,206 --> 01:40:07,052
Subway...! Who'd wanna
do a thing like that?

1316
01:40:07,210 --> 01:40:10,089
- Hey, Z. You got a match?
- No.

1317
01:40:10,254 --> 01:40:12,348
- You got a warrant?
- No.

1318
01:40:12,507 --> 01:40:16,262
Supreme Court says you have to have
a warrant, unless I'm under arrest.

1319
01:40:16,427 --> 01:40:21,058
The way things are goin', they're gonna
be changin' that in about 10 minutes.

1320
01:40:21,224 --> 01:40:23,898
- Mr. Longman, you got a match?
- No.

1321
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:25,437
That's all right.
I'll get it at the stove.

1322
01:40:25,603 --> 01:40:28,231
I'll get it.

1323
01:40:30,024 --> 01:40:31,571
It's a little tricky.

1324
01:40:34,028 --> 01:40:35,655
Has a tendency to explode.

1325
01:40:39,617 --> 01:40:41,460
Come on, Rico, let's go.

1326
01:40:41,619 --> 01:40:42,711
Thanks, Mr. Longman.

1327
01:40:44,914 --> 01:40:46,962
Mr. Longman, we'll be back later.

1328
01:40:47,124 --> 01:40:51,174
Yeah? Listen, I know I got a gripe
with the TA. I know I got a bum rap.

1329
01:40:51,337 --> 01:40:54,557
But I wouldn't do anythin' as stupid
as what you just told me.

1330
01:40:54,715 --> 01:40:56,137
What do think I am? A jerk?

1331
01:40:57,009 --> 01:40:59,137
Do me a favor, will ya?
Get the hell outta here.

1332
01:40:59,303 --> 01:41:02,557
Come on, Mr. Longman. We have
to follow our leads. it's our job!

1333
01:41:02,723 --> 01:41:04,225
Yeah, yeah. Big deal.

1334
01:41:04,392 --> 01:41:08,863
Look, I got my rights. This is my home.
I want a little peace!

1335
01:41:09,021 --> 01:41:11,319
Just do me a favor, will ya?
Get the hell outta here.

1336
01:41:11,482 --> 01:41:14,406
Sorry if we bothered ya, Mr. Longman.

1337
01:41:14,569 --> 01:41:15,661
Come on, Rico.

1338
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:17,572
- Gesundheit!
