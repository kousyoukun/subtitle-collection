00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:37,531
NASA STELLAR OBSERVATION CENTER

2
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:25,108
<i>GODZILLA VS MOTHRA</i>

3
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:29,978
ONE DAY LATER - THAILAND

4
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:13,831
Oh, I've been waiting for you...

5
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:16,403
Am I free?

6
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,337
Takuya Fujito, <i>30</i> years old...

7
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:26,116
Former teacher of archeology
at Tohto University. Single...

8
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,447
However, he was divorced,
has one child...

9
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,318
...and fails to pay his
child support.

10
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:35,524
Masako!

11
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,587
The National Environment
Planning Bureau?

12
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:43,328
That's a big institution. What would
you want with someone like me?

13
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:52,271
We have been investigating the
effects of a fallen meteorite...

14
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:56,280
...on earth's environment
for the past month.

15
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,650
During the investigation,
we found this...

16
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,447
These images were taken
by our satellites.

17
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:10,187
What the...
Where is this?

18
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:16,062
Right now, it's on one of the Indonesian
Islands closed off to our people.

19
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:18,403
I have some tea for us.

20
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,100
Who are you?

21
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:24,876
A representative of the Marutomo
Corporation. My name is Ando.

22
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:29,037
Here...
We're developing that Island.

23
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,180
The Japanese government is
supporting their development.

24
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:35,182
Real IV?

25
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:38,955
Then, you want me
to investigate the area?

26
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:44,059
It's okay if you decline. You probably
couldn't finish the job, anyway.

27
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:46,391
Is that what you think?

28
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,960
There's nothing I can't handle.

29
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,669
Of course, there was a woman
that I couldn't handle...

30
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:02,314
I really think this man would
be a bad choice, after all...

31
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:05,612
Ms. Tezuka, let
him decide for himself.

32
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,450
So, if I accept, I go free?

33
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:13,659
I refuse...

34
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:23,428
I'll probably be free
within a week.

35
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,534
This might be the safest
place for me now.

36
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:29,300
Really? That's just the kind of
thing I'd expect from you...

37
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:33,401
Masako, I'll send you
the child support soon.

38
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:39,818
That might be difficult...
This country is very harsh on thieves.

39
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:42,981
It should be even worse for you since
you destroyed their temple and treasure.

40
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:45,955
Hey, hey, hey! Wait a moment!
How long is my sentence?

41
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:48,417
Well, I wouldn't say
less than fifteen years.

42
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:50,327
Fifteen years?!

43
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,863
Hey, wait a moment, Masako!

44
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,968
Hey, I accept!

45
00:08:56,369 --> 00:09:02,206
Don't leave me, please! Masako!!

46
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:29,930
Yes, please come in.

47
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:32,729
Good morning.

48
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:34,198
Ah, Professor Fukazawa.

49
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:35,637
Thank you for seeing me.
- A pleasure.

50
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,067
Ms. Tezuka and the others have left?

51
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,211
Today. They went to Bangkok.

52
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,610
Do you think those two
will get along?

53
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:44,750
Maybe...

54
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,581
It's difficult to send
those two together...

55
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,552
...especially when they
were just separated.

56
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:54,091
No, I see they still have
feelings for each other.

57
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,969
Our reliance on earth's resources
is destroying our ozone layer.

58
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:08,403
Despite the overwhelming evidence...

59
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,566
...we humans just don't care
about the consequences.

60
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,370
The meteorite is making it worse.

61
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:18,807
<i>The air is deteriorating, the sea rising,
and the earth's plates are shifting...</i>

62
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:22,982
They just don't realize that the
earth is truly in danger.

63
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:36,968
Have you found it?

64
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:43,639
The meteorite caused a strong undersea current.
The waters have not returned to normal yet.

65
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:47,510
Our marking station is
unable to locate Godzilla.

66
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:51,507
The meteor might have raised too
much silt for us to track it.

67
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:55,779
We can't track Godzilla's location?

68
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:31,246
Turn south, three degrees.

69
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:37,686
Hey! Aren't you going to tell me
what my mission is soon?

70
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:42,065
That's right, but I'll let you
worry until we get there.

71
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:48,897
Here.

72
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:56,241
Infant Island?

73
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:17,668
Prepare to drop anchor.

74
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:01,012
Don't drink too much.
It will make you tired.

75
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:28,398
Wow... That's an ugly mound.

76
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:42,646
<i>We must protect these places.
Humans will just tear them apart.</i>

77
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,159
They could do it anytime now.

78
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,090
Has it already happened here?

79
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,671
Hey, is this okay?

80
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,968
The three of us weigh
about 189 kilograms...

81
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,942
It will handle us easily.

82
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:13,013
I believe him.

83
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,252
What do we do now?!

84
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:49,886
Hold tight!

85
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:05,031
How do we get out of
this, you moron?!

86
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:08,742
Masako, did you gain weight?!

87
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:12,737
I don't understand how you could
ask me that at a time like this!

88
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,780
Hey! How can you argue
in this situation?!

89
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:19,310
Great...

90
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:22,681
Jump into the water, quickly!
<i>- What</i> are <i>you saying?!</i>

91
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,617
Do we really have to?

92
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,725
Yes! Come on, hurry!

93
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:32,793
You said... this would...

94
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:37,100
Hold us all!!!

95
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:14,103
Well, what do you know...?

96
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:18,137
It would have been faster if we followed
the river instead of going in the jungle!

97
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:20,546
Amazing...

98
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,350
I didn't think a company
man could row so well.

99
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:29,922
Oh, thank you. I owe it to a
survival training course.

100
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,124
You're probably having more fun
with me than you would at work.

101
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,927
Hey, keep rowing!

102
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:41,591
I am!

103
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:56,610
<i>What kind of shortcut is this?!</i>

104
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:01,880
This is a dead-end!

105
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:07,492
I suggest we make camp for the night.
We can decide on what to do tomorrow.

106
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,467
Here...

107
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:38,722
<i>To my papa, who chases thieves around
the world. I will help you when I grow up.</i>

108
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:43,189
Hey, hey! Did you tell her I was
a policeman or something?

109
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,898
Should I have told her you
were a petty thief?

110
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:59,673
Hey! Wake up!
There's a cavern behind the falls!

111
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:00,979
A cavern?

112
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:42,811
What's this?

113
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:46,559
A stone painting,
from ancient times.

114
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:58,434
Is it a thousand years old?

115
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,506
No, I'd say over
ten thousand years old.

116
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:05,706
This is... ten
thousand years old?

117
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,070
Incredible!

118
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,679
I don't believe it!

119
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:20,324
Hey...

120
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:24,594
Look at this!

121
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:54,324
Look! There's another passage.

122
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:30,561
We found it!

123
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:10,058
What is this?

124
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:13,469
This has no metals,
like a meteor.

125
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,566
It seems more like... an egg.

126
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:21,308
An egg? This big?!

127
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,047
Is it from a dinosaur?

128
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,611
I doubt this was from a dinosaur.

129
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:32,048
<i>It's Mothra...
It's Mothra's egg...</i>

130
00:21:34,193 --> 00:21:36,491
Who is it? Where are you?

131
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:38,596
<i>Here we are...</i>

132
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:44,567
The flower spoke?

133
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:46,838
It seems so...

134
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:00,480
Who are you?

135
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:03,282
We are the Cosmos.

136
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,246
Cosmos?

137
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,860
Are you... from space?

138
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:14,560
We are all pieces placed on this
earth to keep it in harmony.

139
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:21,205
<i>Twelve thousand years ago, we Cosmos
knew Mothra as the protector of the earth.</i>

140
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:25,943
<i>We had no hatred or war.
We lived in perfect harmony.</i>

141
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:31,613
But then, a group of scientists
created twelve machines...

142
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,218
...designed to drain the
life force of the earth.

143
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,653
The earth's life force?

144
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:38,950
The earth had no choice
but to protect itself.

145
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:43,862
It did something
to stop the machines?

146
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:45,329
Yes...

147
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:48,126
It gave birth
to a black Mothra.

148
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:50,630
A black Mothra?

149
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:52,199
It was Battra...

150
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:55,270
Battra's destructive power
is equal to Mothra's.

151
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:59,207
The earth used it
to punish the Cosmos.

152
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:05,616
<i>Mothra and the Cosmos fought Battra, and
we defeated it in the northern ice region.</i>

153
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,518
<i>But Battra destroyed
our weather-control machines...</i>

154
00:23:09,655 --> 00:23:15,116
<i>...and large floods eventually
covered our Island.</i>

155
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:20,459
Mothra and the remaining Cosmos climbed
our highest mountain to escape the floods.

156
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,559
And now, the earth thinks we
are a threat to its life.

157
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,399
We believe so...

158
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:31,300
With the meteorite, the heavy
rains and the landslides...

159
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:35,340
My company's development of the
Island could be playing a part in this?

160
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:38,641
If it wasn't for the meteor...

161
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:42,276
...we believe Mothra's egg would
still be buried in the earth.

162
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:44,752
But now that the
egg is unearthed...

163
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:48,756
What will happen in
the near future?

164
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:51,128
What we are afraid of...

165
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:54,426
...is that Battra may have also been
awakened somewhere in the world.

166
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:01,200
What could that be?

167
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:05,268
What is happening
to the earth?

168
00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,895
Thank you for coming.

169
00:25:04,303 --> 00:25:06,567
What is that demonstration all about?

170
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:09,402
It's an environmental
protection demonstration.

171
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:10,872
Well, just ignore them...

172
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,308
They cannot do anything to
stop the construction.

173
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:16,346
Of course.
We don't need any problems.

174
00:25:17,483 --> 00:25:20,919
We haven't resumed our
operations in Indonesia yet.

175
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:25,146
If I cannot complete
the development of Mt. Fuji...

176
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:26,652
...I would surely lose honor.

177
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:29,985
<i>What?A large egg?</i>

178
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:34,058
Mothra?
What are you babbling about?

179
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:37,334
Listen, we'll talk about this later.

180
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:39,861
Just bring what you've found
and I'll straighten it out!

181
00:25:44,443 --> 00:25:48,038
Is this a trick...?
What's next?

182
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:53,777
Does he think we can bring it
back to Japan at our leisure?

183
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:55,920
It would be better
off staying here.

184
00:25:56,088 --> 00:26:00,218
I thought about
keeping the egg safe.

185
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:02,720
But, with all that
could possibly happen here...

186
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:05,887
...wouldn't Japan be a better
environment to keep it safe?

187
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:09,762
I never thought I'd hear a Marutomo company
man utter the words, “a better environment...

188
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,401
We trust all of you.

189
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:15,699
We don't want your country to make
the same mistakes that we did.

190
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:18,969
Even now, the earth's
plans can be halted.

191
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:22,839
If Mothra's egg will be
of service to you...

192
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:25,107
...then we will go too.

193
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,476
You'll come with us?

194
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:33,420
Thank you... I promise you that we'll tell
everyone about yours and Mothra's message.

195
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:38,956
What kind of thing that large
would be traveling under the sea?

196
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:40,655
Godzilla?

197
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:42,359
Battra.

198
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:44,301
Battra?

199
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:48,168
Yes, this report came
from Ms.Tezuka.

200
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:01,446
<i>Sixth Air-Force Squadron,
you are ordered to scramble.</i>

201
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:06,518
<i>The National Environment Bureau has ordered
you to investigate a disturbance in the sea.</i>

202
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:11,620
<i>The disturbance is 150 kilometers off of the
Noto Peninsula and is approaching rapidly.</i>

203
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:12,863
<i>Roger.</i>

204
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:15,966
<i>You are authorized to
engage the enemy.</i>

205
00:27:16,268 --> 00:27:18,362
<i>Repeat, you are
authorized to engage it.</i>

206
00:27:18,537 --> 00:27:19,368
<i>Roger.</i>

207
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,024
It's coming faster!

208
00:27:45,097 --> 00:27:47,657
That thing is
approaching Japan!

209
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,166
That thing will
devastate the mainland!

210
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:14,489
<i>Al! stations secured and at stand-by.
Prepare to depart.</i>

211
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,816
Your Marutomo company
is quite impressive!

212
00:28:52,164 --> 00:28:54,462
<i>The government reported today...</i>

213
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:57,500
<i>...that a creature has approached
Japan and has burrowed underground.</i>

214
00:28:57,636 --> 00:29:01,504
<i>The creature is reported to be a large caterpillar.
Its precise location is unknown at this time.</i>

215
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:04,927
That's Battra...?

216
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,747
Where did it go?

217
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:10,388
<i>The city of Nagoya
suffered heavy damages...</i>

218
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:14,762
<i>...from a large caterpillar creature
that disappeared into the ground.</i>

219
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,369
<i>The government has been
unable to locate it.</i>

220
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:25,836
What kind of thing that large
would be approaching us?

221
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:53,961
What is that?

222
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:55,696
That's...

223
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:21,132
Have we located Godzilla?

224
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,063
Yes, just off the Philippines.

225
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:25,834
It appeared there?

226
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:28,940
It seems the meteor
triggered a pair of disasters.

227
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:32,939
The earth is punishing us
for our arrogance!

228
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:36,038
The meteor may be the trigger...

229
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:44,048
...but the ones who created this
danger was the entire human race.

230
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:31,329
What are you doing?

231
00:34:31,503 --> 00:34:32,231
Don't you see?

232
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:33,997
The ship is in danger!

233
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:36,004
We have to release the egg!

234
00:34:36,141 --> 00:34:36,869
No!

235
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:39,511
I have been ordered to
bring it back to Japan!

236
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:43,038
That's why I'm
not a salary man!

237
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:16,771
Godzilla is going to
attack Mothra!

238
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,894
Get this ship out of
here, quickly!

239
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:27,871
What's that?

240
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:40,476
Battra.

241
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:41,581
That's it?

242
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,097
Mothra's in danger!

243
00:39:18,256 --> 00:39:19,917
Hey, they're attacking each other!

244
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:34,491
Mothra is returning to our island.

245
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:37,927
Good, while Godzilla and Battra
are fighting. Hurry, get out of here!

246
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,126
Oh, no!

247
00:40:40,071 --> 00:40:43,939
I've invested all this time and money,
and this is what I have to show for it!

248
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:46,840
You're amazing!
That egg and the creature...

249
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:50,407
...would have caused a major
disaster if we brought it to Japan!

250
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:55,883
We've got to get out
of here, quickly!

251
00:42:03,121 --> 00:42:04,282
Scan sonar.

252
00:42:11,229 --> 00:42:13,197
What's happening under the water?

253
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:18,728
Did the creature cause the
volcanic eruption?

254
00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:23,097
It's between the Philippine
plate and the Eurasian plate.

255
00:43:04,115 --> 00:43:05,082
They're gone!

256
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:07,647
Battra? Godzilla?

257
00:43:09,387 --> 00:43:11,549
They've vanished from our scanners!

258
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:13,690
They went into the undersea volcano?

259
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:16,627
How can Godzilla
withstand the magma?

260
00:43:50,428 --> 00:43:52,760
How could he have
helped science?

261
00:43:53,431 --> 00:43:56,924
I don't know what they could do with
the egg upon our return to Japan.

262
00:43:57,101 --> 00:43:58,398
Really...

263
00:43:58,536 --> 00:44:01,597
They would have made
a spectacle of it all.

264
00:44:03,174 --> 00:44:05,609
How many years has it been
since we agreed on something?

265
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:12,013
With Battra and Godzilla
in the volcano...

266
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:14,784
I'm not sure that
this is over.

267
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:23,687
This reminds me of our honeymoon
at the hotel in Cairo.

268
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:27,492
We thought that everything
would come to us.

269
00:44:30,635 --> 00:44:33,502
I wanted to be a powerful
figure, remember?

270
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:38,075
I remember. But...

271
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:40,777
But...?

272
00:44:43,915 --> 00:44:47,112
Power without wisdom
can be painful.

273
00:44:49,387 --> 00:44:50,252
Don't worry...

274
00:44:50,655 --> 00:44:53,124
Everyone has to
grow up sometime.

275
00:44:53,391 --> 00:44:55,723
We can't afford to stay
in our eggs forever.

276
00:44:56,961 --> 00:44:58,087
I see...

277
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:01,021
Maybe humans can learn
something from Mothra.

278
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:02,792
Yes, I think so.

279
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,943
It's terrible! I can't find the
Cosmos! They're missing!

280
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:14,634
Where's Ando?

281
00:45:17,682 --> 00:45:19,309
<i>Great!</i>

282
00:45:21,285 --> 00:45:25,244
If we use the girls as the Marutomo
Group's main spokespeople...

283
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:27,690
...we'll get lots of publicity!

284
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:30,357
Yes. That's what I thought!

285
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:33,763
Ando, good job!

286
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:35,760
Thank you.

287
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:42,299
Girls, I'll make you rich
if you work for us.

288
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:48,944
They'll need a place to stay.

289
00:45:49,714 --> 00:45:52,547
Ando, see if you can get some...

290
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:55,951
...furniture for our small guests.

291
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,046
But, I don't know what
I could get for them!

292
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:03,786
Oh... I know, doll things!

293
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:05,688
Get them doll furniture
to suit their needs!

294
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:06,820
Oh, of course!

295
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:20,510
Hey... Hey!

296
00:46:20,678 --> 00:46:21,406
What?

297
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:23,206
Why are you walking so fast?

298
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:26,874
What if something happens to the Cosmos
and Mothra comes to Japan to help them?

299
00:46:27,051 --> 00:46:28,109
What are you talking about?

300
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:32,052
They said they would come to Japan to
spread their message across the world.

301
00:46:32,223 --> 00:46:35,716
But if Marutomo uses them for publicity,
we'll have broken our promise to them!

302
00:46:35,893 --> 00:46:37,691
Doesn’t that bother you at all?

303
00:46:47,238 --> 00:46:48,296
MIDORI!

304
00:46:49,507 --> 00:46:50,872
We're back!

305
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:52,267
Welcome home, mama.

306
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:53,741
Were you a good girl?

307
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:55,842
Welcome back!

308
00:46:56,013 --> 00:46:57,913
Thank you for caring for MIDORI.

309
00:46:58,082 --> 00:47:00,278
We rushed over here when I
heard you were coming home.

310
00:47:00,451 --> 00:47:02,283
You came to greet us too?

311
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:03,717
He just arrived.

312
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:05,253
Welcome back.

313
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:09,087
I'm traveling by helicopter to Mt.
Fuji's volcanic activity center.

314
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:11,086
Why would you go there?

315
00:47:12,697 --> 00:47:13,459
You don't mean...?

316
00:47:14,532 --> 00:47:16,159
It seems that way.

317
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:19,600
The meteor must have done some
damage to the Philippine plate.

318
00:47:21,472 --> 00:47:23,873
What will this do to the earth?

319
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:26,567
Hey, where's papa?

320
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:33,408
He was just here...

321
00:47:44,128 --> 00:47:49,157
Mr. Tomokame is insisting that
Marutomo owns the Cosmos.

322
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:52,435
He is refusing to return them to us.

323
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:54,060
<i>He's so selfish!</i>

324
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:58,275
Doesn't he realize his arrogance
could threaten us all?

325
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:02,944
The earth's life force will
react to human selfishness.

326
00:48:21,332 --> 00:48:22,299
It's finally coming.

327
00:50:03,267 --> 00:50:05,326
Is Mothra really
returning to Japan?

328
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:09,997
Yes, its speed right now is
increasing with each moment.

329
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:12,742
It will attack just like Battra.

330
00:50:13,077 --> 00:50:14,670
Mothra is not Battra.

331
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:17,871
It is not coming to destroy the city,
it's coming to help the Cosmos...

332
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:22,919
It doesn't matter why it's coming, the
fact is that it'll destroy Tokyo to do it.

333
00:50:23,153 --> 00:50:27,420
First, we'll block off Tokyo Bay to
see how aggressive Mothra can be.

334
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:33,661
But, if warning shots do not stop it,
we'll have to fire on it directly.

335
00:50:33,998 --> 00:50:36,262
We must expect the worst
of the situation.

336
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:37,229
I understand!

337
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:39,836
That's why we must
get the Cosmos back!

338
00:50:40,004 --> 00:50:41,938
Only they can stop
Mothra from attacking!

339
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:44,131
<i>The Cosmos are no
longer within our reach.</i>

340
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:49,336
I just spoke with
an official at Marutomo.

341
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:51,909
They are missing
from their home.

342
00:51:21,345 --> 00:51:24,315
Sir! We can't stop Mothra.

343
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:29,982
We have no choice,
we will have to attack it.

344
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:50,884
Is Mothra coming to Tokyo?

345
00:53:51,128 --> 00:53:54,462
It seems so, huh?
Well, what do you hear?

346
00:53:55,966 --> 00:53:57,730
Turn off the radio, please.

347
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:02,296
I can hear them. A song...

348
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:04,970
It's strong.

349
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:16,377
Has Ms. Tezuka called in?

350
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:17,349
No, she hasn't called yet.

351
00:55:11,175 --> 00:55:13,610
<i>Mothra has just landed in Tokyo...</i>

352
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:18,141
This way, this way!

353
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:20,109
Hurry! This way, this way!

354
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:24,146
This way, please!

355
00:55:24,888 --> 00:55:26,447
This way, please!

356
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:54,606
Is that Mothra?

357
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:56,750
Sir, we should leave.

358
00:55:57,154 --> 00:55:59,851
It's our fault that it's here.

359
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:01,151
What are you saying, you idiot?!

360
00:56:02,459 --> 00:56:07,863
Destroy it! Destroy it all!
I'll rebuild the whole city!

361
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:20,509
They're here...

362
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,241
Really? I understand!

363
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,015
They're in Akasaka!

364
00:56:26,183 --> 00:56:29,153
Sir! Mothra is heading
for Akasaka!

365
00:57:27,244 --> 00:57:29,042
<i>Mothra is approaching...</i>

366
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:32,978
<i>It is recommended that you evacuate
the city for your own safety.</i>

367
00:57:38,588 --> 00:57:40,078
Ah, here's Papa!

368
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:46,790
You've grown!

369
00:57:46,964 --> 00:57:48,728
Papa, you see?
I'm not a baby!

370
00:57:49,433 --> 00:57:50,332
Real IV?

371
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:57,073
She missed you.

372
00:58:06,683 --> 00:58:10,176
Papa, are you going to
return the Cosmos to Mama?

373
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,520
I might not have done
the right thing...

374
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:20,060
...but bringing her to this dangerous
area was very irresponsible.

375
00:58:21,031 --> 00:58:23,932
I have every right to let MIDORI see where
the money I get for her support comes from.

376
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:27,799
Papa, I don't want to be
the daughter of a thief.

377
00:58:28,472 --> 00:58:31,737
I didn't say anything.
She guessed...

378
00:58:38,782 --> 00:58:42,480
I was going to start a new
life with the reward.

379
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:44,448
All by yourself?

380
00:58:47,457 --> 00:58:48,720
I would have told you.

381
00:58:48,892 --> 00:58:51,259
I've decided to
help the Cosmos.

382
00:58:51,395 --> 00:58:53,159
There's nothing else to say.

383
00:58:53,563 --> 00:58:55,088
And if I agree...

384
00:58:55,665 --> 00:58:57,360
Then we'll have
room for discussion.

385
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:04,697
Mothra is almost here!
Hurry, we must leave!

386
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,348
Hey! Are you okay?!

387
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,086
MIDORI!

388
00:59:52,489 --> 00:59:56,119
Cosmos, please stop Mothra
from attacking us...

389
00:59:56,793 --> 01:00:00,661
...and I'll teach my papa that
stealing is a bad thing to do!

390
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,923
Don't you feel ashamed to have
put your child through this?

391
01:00:04,968 --> 01:00:07,300
We understand, okay?
Don't cry anymore.

392
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:13,171
Please bake us to where
we can see Mothra.

393
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:16,837
Sir, we have a call.
It's the commander.

394
01:00:17,013 --> 01:00:17,946
Roger.

395
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:20,783
It's stopped fighting.
It seems to be searching.

396
01:01:01,458 --> 01:01:05,190
Mothra, we are here.
We are alright now.

397
01:01:05,762 --> 01:01:08,254
Please do not worry.
Will you behave?

398
01:01:11,968 --> 01:01:13,868
Mothra understood us.

399
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:16,439
Thank you, Mothra.

400
01:01:29,419 --> 01:01:30,580
Mothra!

401
01:01:44,267 --> 01:01:44,927
Fire!

402
01:01:58,114 --> 01:01:58,979
Don't!

403
01:01:59,816 --> 01:02:00,749
Stop!

404
01:02:21,304 --> 01:02:22,794
There are still people
in the hotel!

405
01:02:23,106 --> 01:02:24,437
Cease fire!

406
01:02:38,388 --> 01:02:39,947
Is Mothra dying?

407
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:57,039
Where is it going?

408
01:03:00,043 --> 01:03:01,943
It's headed for
the Diet Building!

409
01:03:26,436 --> 01:03:29,098
Professor! Mothra is
no longer our concern!

410
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:34,910
What's this? The pressure of the
magma has increased dramatically?

411
01:03:37,113 --> 01:03:38,103
Inform the command...

412
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:42,275
...that within one hour, no, in thirty
minutes, we could have volcano activity!

413
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:08,878
Is Mothra going to die?

414
01:04:09,612 --> 01:04:13,378
Mothra will not die.
It is completing its larva stage.

415
01:04:13,883 --> 01:04:15,351
Larva stage?

416
01:06:01,825 --> 01:06:05,887
Look! The Environmental
Bureau... stole our property!

417
01:06:06,863 --> 01:06:08,854
Sir, don't you understand yet?

418
01:06:09,032 --> 01:06:12,127
Mothra and the Cosmos
have a special mission!

419
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:14,236
If we misuse them
for our own purposes...

420
01:06:14,404 --> 01:06:17,073
...Marutomo and everything
else will be destroyed!

421
01:06:17,073 --> 01:06:18,131
Marutomo?!

422
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:21,036
What are you saying, bastard?

423
01:06:36,259 --> 01:06:37,693
Mount Fuji is erupting

424
01:06:56,379 --> 01:06:57,312
Stop, please.

425
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:04,010
Hang on!

426
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:08,023
Hurry!
- Yes!

427
01:07:24,507 --> 01:07:25,531
What did you say?!

428
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:36,481
Infant Island, now Mount Fuji...

429
01:07:38,421 --> 01:07:43,382
Why... Why is this
happening only to us?

430
01:07:46,296 --> 01:07:48,128
Because the earth is angry.

431
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:54,495
Your head...

432
01:07:55,872 --> 01:07:57,840
Did you hit it in the fall?

433
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:01,510
I'm not crazy...

434
01:08:02,145 --> 01:08:03,635
It is you who
is the insane fool!

435
01:08:06,549 --> 01:08:07,573
You're fired...

436
01:08:09,319 --> 01:08:10,650
Get the hell out of here!

437
01:08:11,354 --> 01:08:13,516
I'll leave...

438
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:16,791
The monsters will destroy you...

439
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:20,328
...and you'll pay for threatening
the earth's life force!

440
01:08:27,637 --> 01:08:29,298
The earth's life force?

441
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:32,369
Make me pay?!

442
01:08:34,077 --> 01:08:35,442
How can that be?!

443
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:39,014
How can it...?

444
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:42,184
How can it...?!

445
01:09:00,603 --> 01:09:01,900
Godzilla...

446
01:09:03,306 --> 01:09:03,772
Oh, no...

447
01:09:39,275 --> 01:09:40,265
Main screen, on!

448
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:05,792
Godzilla!

449
01:11:09,599 --> 01:11:11,067
How did it get here?

450
01:11:11,534 --> 01:11:15,266
It probably traveled beneath
the earth's mantle.

451
01:11:15,571 --> 01:11:18,541
It must have broke through
Mt. Fuji's mantle to get out.

452
01:11:18,741 --> 01:11:20,038
That's ridiculous!

453
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:23,610
The temperature beneath the
mantle is fifteen-hundred degrees!

454
01:11:24,981 --> 01:11:27,279
It is far beyond
our comprehension.

455
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:59,307
Switch to emergency power.

456
01:12:01,884 --> 01:12:05,445
Miss Saegusa? It's Godzilla!
Godzilla has appeared!

457
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:15,426
Commander!
Godzilla has appeared!

458
01:12:16,098 --> 01:12:16,690
What?!

459
01:12:19,268 --> 01:12:20,167
Is it Godzilla?

460
01:12:20,603 --> 01:12:22,196
It came out of Mount Fuji!

461
01:12:22,972 --> 01:12:24,167
It's incredible!

462
01:12:24,907 --> 01:12:27,308
Now, it's headed for
East Tanazawa.

463
01:12:27,443 --> 01:12:28,740
Mama, look!

464
01:14:34,537 --> 01:14:35,527
It's pretty!

465
01:15:24,553 --> 01:15:27,614
Mothra is going
to fight Battra again.

466
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:30,181
You mean, Battra isn't dead?

467
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:04,788
Battra from the sea...
Godzilla from the mountain...

468
01:16:05,795 --> 01:16:06,728
Our self-defense force...?

469
01:16:07,263 --> 01:16:11,564
Our forces will focus on
pushing Godzilla southward.

470
01:16:11,867 --> 01:16:14,359
It's possible we can steer
it into the Sagami Bay.

471
01:18:09,618 --> 01:18:13,919
<i>Godzilla</i> is heading for the Yokohama area.
We ask that everyone evacuate the area now.</i>

472
01:18:14,456 --> 01:18:17,790
<i>Godzilla will pass through the
Nishi and Kanagawa area...</i>

473
01:19:26,962 --> 01:19:31,832
My god...!
What can we use to stop it?!

474
01:23:02,845 --> 01:23:03,607
Godzilla!

475
01:24:15,117 --> 01:24:16,278
Look! It's Mothra!

476
01:26:21,610 --> 01:26:22,543
Look out, Mothra!

477
01:26:22,711 --> 01:26:23,269
Hurry! Get out of there!

478
01:26:56,812 --> 01:26:57,472
What's that?

479
01:27:05,087 --> 01:27:06,782
Godzilla's flame is
reflecting back from it!

480
01:27:07,322 --> 01:27:09,347
That's Mothra's most
powerful weapon!

481
01:27:41,857 --> 01:27:42,688
Oh, no!

482
01:27:42,858 --> 01:27:43,450
Look out!

483
01:27:57,706 --> 01:27:59,868
Battra went to help Mothra!

484
01:28:09,484 --> 01:28:11,612
Now, Mothra and Battra
both understand.

485
01:31:16,338 --> 01:31:17,066
Incredible!

486
01:31:17,405 --> 01:31:21,865
Mothra and Battra have joined forces!
They will try to defeat Godzilla!

487
01:31:28,116 --> 01:31:29,049
Godzilla is...

488
01:31:54,776 --> 01:31:55,743
They did it!

489
01:32:25,173 --> 01:32:28,541
Huh? They seem to be
talking to each other!

490
01:32:28,943 --> 01:32:32,208
Yes... I wonder what
they're saying?

491
01:32:33,281 --> 01:32:34,680
Yes, what?

492
01:32:48,463 --> 01:32:49,157
Battra!

493
01:33:01,076 --> 01:33:01,838
Battra is hurt!

494
01:33:34,976 --> 01:33:37,570
Keep holding it!
Good luck!

495
01:33:53,294 --> 01:33:54,227
They did it!

496
01:34:02,303 --> 01:34:03,600
They're really doing it!

497
01:35:56,618 --> 01:35:57,551
<i>What are you saying?</i>

498
01:35:57,986 --> 01:36:00,580
A huge meteor will strike the earth
at the end of the 20th century?

499
01:36:00,755 --> 01:36:02,052
I can't believe it!

500
01:36:02,457 --> 01:36:05,119
Battra was supposed to wake
up when the time came.

501
01:36:05,426 --> 01:36:09,021
So, will this meteor
destroy the earth?

502
01:36:09,597 --> 01:36:10,530
Yes...

503
01:36:10,832 --> 01:36:13,028
Battra's mission was to
protect the earth...

504
01:36:13,167 --> 01:36:16,102
...by destroying the meteor
when it was in range.

505
01:36:16,271 --> 01:36:17,864
But now, Battra is dead...

506
01:36:20,241 --> 01:36:22,141
And now Mothra
is going to stop it?

507
01:36:24,245 --> 01:36:28,239
The meteor is still far
off in deep space.

508
01:36:28,850 --> 01:36:32,150
When it finds it, Mothra will change
its course away from the earth.

509
01:36:32,587 --> 01:36:36,990
Why is it trying to save us,
after all we've done to it?

510
01:36:37,525 --> 01:36:41,621
Because Mothra promised
Battra to complete its mission.

511
01:36:42,096 --> 01:36:43,257
Promised?

512
01:36:45,033 --> 01:36:46,558
Right, the time they
were speaking...

513
01:36:49,971 --> 01:36:50,995
Until next time...

514
01:36:59,113 --> 01:37:00,308
Goodbye!

515
01:37:35,783 --> 01:37:37,649
Goodbye!

516
01:37:56,471 --> 01:37:59,930
<i>When earth's next
millennium begins...</i>

517
01:38:00,441 --> 01:38:04,708
<i>...please take a moment to think
about Mothra and us.</i>

518
01:38:21,863 --> 01:38:24,332
Isn't Mothra going
to come back?

519
01:38:28,035 --> 01:38:29,469
It'll return, someday.

520
01:38:35,576 --> 01:38:38,807
Until then, it's up to us
to save the earth, okay?
