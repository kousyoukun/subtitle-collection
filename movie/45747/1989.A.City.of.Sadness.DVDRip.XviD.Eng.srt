00:00:09,248 --> 00:00:15,248
<i>After pondering the situation in
the world and in our empire,</i>

2
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:21,049
<i>...we have decided to resort to
an extraordinary measure.</i>

3
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:26,050
<i>Loyal subjects, we have ordered
our government...</i>

4
00:00:26,051 --> 00:00:30,051
<i>...to communicate to
the USA, Great Britain,</i>

5
00:00:30,052 --> 00:00:33,052
<i>...China and the USSR,</i>

6
00:00:33,053 --> 00:00:37,053
<i>...our acceptance of
the provisions...</i>

7
00:00:37,054 --> 00:00:40,054
<i>...of their Joint Declaration.</i>

8
00:00:42,055 --> 00:00:47,055
<i>To strive for the security and
well-being of our subjects...</i>

9
00:00:47,056 --> 00:00:51,056
<i>...and for the prosperity and happiness
of all nations, is a...</i>

10
00:00:51,057 --> 00:00:56,257
<i>...solemn obligation handed down by
our imperial ancestors.</i>

11
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,558
<i>We declared war on
the USA and Britain...</i>

12
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,559
<i>...out of a desire to ensure
the self-preservation of Japan...</i>

13
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,560
<i>...and the stability of
East Asia.</i>

14
00:01:10,561 --> 00:01:12,561
<i>To violate the sovereignty of others...</i>

15
00:01:12,562 --> 00:01:15,562
<i>...or to embark on
territorial aggrandizement,</i>

16
00:01:15,563 --> 00:01:19,563
<i>...was far from our
thoughts.</i>

17
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:23,607
Relax.

18
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,411
Gently. Or it will bemore difficult.

19
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:32,682
Open your mouth when I tell you.

20
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:35,693
Keep it closed now.

21
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,556
You are doing fine, just fine.

22
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:43,158
The pain is coming back?

23
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:46,834
Close your mouth.

24
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,303
Do you feel the need
for a bowel movement?

25
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:51,471
Do you?

26
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:56,278
Is that what it feels like?
Well, squeeze tightly then.

27
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:07,390
Prepare the water!

28
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:28,039
Hurry!

29
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,731
The light has come on again. At last.

30
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:31,233
It's a boy...
Congratulations.

31
00:03:36,234 --> 00:03:41,234
<i>On August 151945. Japan announced
its unconditional surrender.</i>

32
00:03:41,235 --> 00:03:46,235
<i>Taiwan was liberated following
51 years of Japanese occupation.</i>

33
00:03:46,236 --> 00:03:51,136
<i>The wife of older brother,
Lin Wen-heung, gave birth to a son.</i>

CITY OF SADNESS
Directed by Hou Hsiao-hsien

36
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:34,732
Going already?
Sorry for the mess.

37
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,041
We didn't give you a proper welcome.

38
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:39,072
Come again.

39
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:45,715
- Ah, hello.
- A small gift for you.

40
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,613
Go and play over there.

41
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:53,683
Behave or grandfather will
take a stick to you.

42
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:58,890
Yes, it's me.

43
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:01,124
Thank you, thank you.

44
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,829
I don't want to inconvenience you.

45
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:04,698
I am sorry to trouble you.

46
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:07,897
Thanks.

47
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,539
Until this evening then.

48
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:15,403
I'll be waiting for you.

49
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:23,520
Wen-heung,

50
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:28,385
...did you tell your brother
you were coming?

51
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:31,553
I wrote to Wen-ching.

52
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:34,195
He is too busy to come.

53
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,631
He can't come?

54
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:39,929
So who will take
the photos?

55
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:44,973
Don't worry, father.
I've arranged everything.

56
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,807
Who did you ask?

57
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:50,849
A photographer friend
of old Gao-kun.

58
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,510
He's a top-knotch photographer.

59
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:55,083
The best in the district.

60
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,780
Not as good as Wen-ching.

61
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,457
Mr Xu is here.
Show him in.

62
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:22,011
To business and to our
future prosperity.

63
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,208
To prosperity!

Don't move.

67
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,700
Smile, please.

68
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,150
Ready?

69
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,500
Thanks!

70

<i>20 years and 11 months of

72

<i>I took the letter of recommendation

<i>My brother was giving classes and...</i>

75
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:26,612
<i>...sent his friend Wen-ching

76
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:30,747
<i>It was cool in the mountains...</i>

77
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,714

<i>I feel so happy.</i>

80
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,690
A photograph.

81
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,256
Beautiful.

82

<i>Photographs of two of my older

<i>They have still not returned. Someone in
Shanghai saw my third brother.</i>

84
00:09:55,559 --> 00:10:00,559
<i>But we have had no news of the second,
who was sent to the Philippines.</i>

85
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:34,395
This is the studio of Wen-ching.

86
00:10:35,396 --> 00:10:37,396
Hinoe says that this is the
studio of Wen-ching.

87
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:40,463
Why isn't he here?

88
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:46,808
Where is Wen-ching?

89
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:48,880
At the back, taking photos.

90
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,011
Come in, please.

91
00:11:32,012 --> 00:11:34,012
- After you.
- No, after you.

92
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:39,625
Are all these books yours?

93
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:42,757
Mine and Wen-ching's.

94
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,460
We are real
book worms.

95
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,266
Are you reading Marx?

96
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:49,732
Very progressive, eh?

97
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:52,504
They are all interesting, and so
we are studying them.

98
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:05,551
Mr Lin, do you remember Wen-ching?

99
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:08,026
The deaf man.

100
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:10,526
Wen-ching.

101
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:12,720
Let me introduce...

102
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:14,831
...Mr Lin.

103
00:12:15,032 --> 00:12:15,832
Pleased to meet you.

104
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:17,661
My mentor.

105
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,534
We've heard a lot about you.

106
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:27,775
It's a pleasure.

107
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:30,705
Mr Ho, a journalist.

108
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:32,706
From the mainland.

109
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:42,093
Please sit down.

110
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:51,093
Are you familiar with China?

111
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,430
There's a lot for me to learn.

112
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:56,473
China is in a mess
at present.

113
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:58,573
Ever since Chen Yi became
governor of Taiwan,

114
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:04,038
...things have changed.
He thinks differently from the Japanese.

115
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:05,539
In what way?

116
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:09,540
He manages things differently
from the Japanese.

117
00:13:10,241 --> 00:13:14,241
<i>Our Japanese director had an
attack this morning...</i>

118
00:13:14,242 --> 00:13:18,242
<i>...but he insisted on going out
after he'd had an injection.</i>

119
00:13:18,243 --> 00:13:21,243
<i>His daughter Shizuko is very sad.</i>

120
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,900
During the past 3 days,
dad has been...

121
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:41,400
threatening to go to the south of Taiwan
He said that Mr Chen would take him.

122
00:13:43,835 --> 00:13:47,950
But he died years ago.

123
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,950
Dad was at his funeral.

124
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,750
The other day, the Japanese
Repatriation Office told us...

125
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:06,620
...that a boat would be coming to
Keelung to pick us up.

126
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:10,100
They told us not to go
too far away.

127
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:17,650
But this morning dad packed
his bags and left.

128
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,780
We are all very worried.

129
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,492
A pain... in the head.

130
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,792
A pain... in the head.

131
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,136
A pain... in the stomach.

132
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,937
A pain... in the stomach.

133
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:17,077
Where does it hurt?

134
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,713
Don't worry.

135
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:57,215
I don't think it's serious.

136
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,222
Thank goodness he came back.

137
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,887
He can recover here.

138
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:15,931
Perhaps my mother's grave is
in an unlucky location.

139
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:20,606
She died leaving four children.

140
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:25,278
My younger brother
disappeared in the Phillippines.

141
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:27,782
The youngest is deaf.

142
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,111
The third came back from the war but
is mad.

143
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:38,325
Wen-leung, what are you doing?

144
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:54,472
Wen-leung, quiet!

145
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,546
Let me be!

146
00:17:04,014 --> 00:17:05,014
Wen-leung, you're mad!

147
00:17:14,014 --> 00:17:15,014
Wen-leung, calm down!

148
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,704
Wen-leung, calm down!

149
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:24,606
Wen-leung, calm down!

150
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:31,014
Quiet! Quiet!

151
00:17:56,014 --> 00:17:59,014
It's OK.

152
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,263
He'll be fine now.

153
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,534
<i>When Taiwan was returned
to China,</i>

154
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,508
<i>...they told us we'd change flags.</i>

155
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:08,375
The Japanese flag is white
with a red circle in the middle.

156
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:12,450
You can hang it in a way that's...

157
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:16,214
...different from the Chinese flag.

158
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:19,188
The people held discussions. Should
the sun be on the top or the bottom?

159
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,350
But the mayor was adamant.
It had to be on the bottom.

160
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,461
At daybreak, the sky is red and so
the sun had to be at the bottom.

161
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,524
Everyone had to have it
as he said.

162
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,725
But he sent someone to check.

163
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,861
The first people he checked had
hung it correctly,

164
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:36,498
...but not in the mountains.

165
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,040
Most people put the sun
on the bottom.

166
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:40,000
And so the mayor felt
vindicated.

167
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,050
But during the day, a man
arrived from the city...

168
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:46,048
...and said he was wrong,

169
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:49,609
...and that they'd shoot him for it.

170
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:52,849
The mayor landed and gave new orders,

171
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:55,425
...but it was already sunset.

172
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,222
The sky was completely red.

173
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,421
It's extraordinary. Suddenly,
Japanese flags...

174
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,659
...were no use any more.

175
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:04,928
Only as underpants for children.

176
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,335
They all have red bums.

177
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,837
Like monkeys.

178
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:12,739
Wu too has one.

179
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:14,150
Mind what you say.

180
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,541
This man
is a reporter from the mainland.

181
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:18,750
Can your wife do something
with my flag?

182
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,256
I'll write that all the teachers...

183
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:24,478
...in Taiwan have red backsides.

184
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:27,820
Let's stop talking
and drink.

185
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:29,757
Cheers.

186
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,000
Let's change the subject.

187
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:35,792
Now that the war is over,
how are things inTaiwan?

188
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,461
Everything's fine.

189
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:42,768
We are under the Chinese flag
once more.

190
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:44,938
Reunited with the motherland.

191
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:48,501
It's a good feeling.

192
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:50,940
But to tell the truth,

193
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:54,409
...Governor Chen Yi
is a bandit...

194
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:57,152
...and I don't trust
the Nationalist government.

195
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,747
Enough politics!
Let's drink!

196
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,726
Let's drink.

197
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,500
Raise your glasses.

198
00:21:58,016 --> 00:21:59,278
They are singing
"The Song of the Exiles".

199
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:01,375
Yes, that's right.

200
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:05,149
We mainlanders
have heard it on the radio.

201
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:08,251
Let's join in.

202
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,784
Yes, let's.

203
00:22:10,385 --> 00:22:12,285
September 18...

204
00:22:13,186 --> 00:22:15,286
September 18...

205
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:21,031
Ever since that tragic day...

206
00:22:24,232 --> 00:22:26,132
September 18...

207
00:22:27,533 --> 00:22:29,533
September 18...

208
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:35,009
Ever since that tragic day...

209
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:42,216
...I have been far from my home.

210
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:48,165
I abandoned a wealth of treasure...

211
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:54,569
...and began my wanderings...

212
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,431
...began my wanderings.

213
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:04,077
Far from home...

214
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:07,483
...I began my wanderings...

215
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,650
...began my wanderings.

216
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:15,251
In what year...

217
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,022
...or in what month...

218
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:24,270
...will I commence my return
to my beloved home?

219
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:33,210
In what year...

220
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:36,573
...or in what month...

221
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:42,792
...will I commence my return
to my beloved home?

222
00:25:21,464 --> 00:25:22,814
Good day, Miss Shizuko.

223
00:25:22,914 --> 00:25:24,014
Good day.

224
00:25:24,914 --> 00:25:26,164
Is Hinomi here?

225
00:25:26,314 --> 00:25:28,080
She's on duty.

226
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,854
I'm sorry.

227
00:25:31,014 --> 00:25:36,114
- Hello, can I help ypu?
- I'd like to speak to Hinomi.

228
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:39,630
She's in the surgery.

229
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:41,035
Maybe she's finished.

230
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:42,536
Shall I find out for you?

231
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,550
Wait a moment, please.

232
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:03,400
This sword was the most precious
possession of my dead brother.

233
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,600
It's no use to him now.

234
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:12,850
Please, give it to Hinoe.

235
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,900
I know my brother
will treasure it.

236
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,600
This is a poem my brother wrote.

237
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:31,300
Hinoe was there
when he wrote it.

238
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:37,050
Please give it to him with the sword
as a memento.

239
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,370
Thank you.

240
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,600
This is for you, Hinomi.

241
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,100
For me?

242
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,150
A kimono?

243
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,800
It's lovely,

244
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:12,800
...but I can't accept it.

245
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,300
It's your most precious possession.

246
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,750
Please accept it.

247
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,050
When I am back in Japan,

248
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,070
...you'll think of you
whenever you use it.

249
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,870
Shizuko...

250
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:38,400
Hinoe has been so nice
to us all these years.

251
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,400
We must never forget
each other.

252
00:28:02,901 --> 00:28:08,101
<i>The dragonfly, red in
the sunset.</i>

253
00:28:12,702 --> 00:28:18,102
Did I see you the other day?

254
00:28:23,003 --> 00:28:28,303
When I was picking
mulberries in the fields,

255
00:28:34,604 --> 00:28:39,504
...did I see you or was
it only a dream?

256
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,500
I'll always remember you.

257
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,550
The flowers are blown hither
and thither.

258
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,750
I'll soon follow them.

259
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,950
The same will come to pass for us all.

260
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:01,889
The Japanese love the sight
of cherry trees.

261
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:04,827
First, in bloom...

262
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:09,397
...and then, when the flowers fall
to earth.

263
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:15,042
They believe life
too is like that.

264
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,150
In the Meiji Era...

265
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,700
...a woman killed herself
by flinging herself into a waterfall.

266
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,581
<i>In the Meiji Era...</i>

267
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:25,479
<i>...a woman killed herself
by flinging herself into a waterfall.</i>

268
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:30,827
<i>She wasn't tired of life. She hadn't
lost the will to live.</i>

269
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:34,221
<i>She just couldn't face the loss
of her youth.</i>

270
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:38,400
<i>Once lost, nothing
means anything.</i>

271
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:41,562
<i>Why not imitate
the cherry blossom...</i>

272
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,135
<i>...and fall when in the fullness
of our beauty?</i>

273
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:46,470
<i>Carried by the wind.</i>

274
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:49,174
<i>The note she left
was an inspiration...</i>

275
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:53,516
<i>...to all young people...</i>

276
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:57,788
<i>...during the Meiji Era.</i>

277
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:01,091
<i>A time of idealism
and heroic spirit.</i>

278
00:31:19,892 --> 00:31:22,492
<i>The flowers fly hither
and thither.</i>

279
00:31:22,493 --> 00:31:25,493
<i>And I'll soon follow them.</i>

280
00:31:25,494 --> 00:31:27,894
<i>The same will come to pass for us all.</i>

281
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:40,926
In which ward is Wen-leung?

282
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:43,364
I see him now.

283
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:54,374
<i>Wen-leung, business is what men
are for, isn't it?</i>

284
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,739
<i>Men can do any kind
of work.</i>

285
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:01,974
Now that you have recovered,
you can do anything.

286
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:05,920
You have six boats in your family,

287
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:08,991
...laden with rice and sugar...

288
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:12,461
...and ready to set sail to make a lot
of money in China.

289
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:14,828
Those boats are ideal
for smuggling.

290
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:19,333
We'd make a lot of money
with a single round trip.

291
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:22,331
What do you say?

292
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:30,473
I'll have to ask
my brother.

293
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:34,344
Ask what?

294
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:37,285
Do you consult him on everything?

295
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:40,186
Let's keep this between ourselves.

296
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:44,057
We Shanghai people are well
organized. Don't worry.

297
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:45,390
We'll take care of everything.

298
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:48,428
The rice and the sugar
are not a problem.

299
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:51,060
Come on, be shrewed.

300
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:55,071
When opportunity knocks,
it's foolish not to open the door.

301
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,434
Cheers!

302
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,512
To you, Wen-leung.

303
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,120
Ah-ga, enjoying the company
of the ladies, I see.

304
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:18,888
Ah-tao, look to table eight.

305
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,020
Excuse me.

306
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:25,234
May I present Tsun-chu
and Yen-hung.

307
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:28,962
Be nice to these mainlanders,
and see they have a good time.

308
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:34,403
What's this?

309
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:37,374
We are talking business!

310
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:40,350
What are all these women
doing here?

311
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,349
Come sit here.

312
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:44,978
Come.

313
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:46,283
Forget those mainlanders.

314
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:11,008
I was waiting for you.

315
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:13,579
I have a business proposal for you.

316
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,854
Take a good look.
Can you tell the difference?

317
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:36,672
Red Monkey, introduce me.

318
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,139
It's Ah-ga.

319
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,834
This is my girl, Ah-tsun.

320
00:34:39,944 --> 00:34:40,968
Hello.

321
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,068
You're very beautiful.

322
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,704
And you're very nice.

323
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:45,915
Have a cigarette.

324
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:47,777
Let me light it for you.

325
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:52,745
Mr. Ah-ga, we were hoping
to see you more often.

326
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:53,881
You will.

327
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:55,117
Thanks.

328
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:57,194
I'm going in, Red Monkey.

329
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:06,634
These are real Japanese
banknotes.

330
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:09,363
We'll put a stamp on them
and then they can be cashed.

331
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,938
Is it Kimguichiu's share?

332
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,704
How many do you have?

333
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,311
A full valise.

334
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:22,547
Have you had an idea?

335
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,620
No problem.

336
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:39,398
Not now, Red Monkey.

337
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:42,366
I want to sleep.

338
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,304
Let me rest.

339
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:46,774
I don't want to do it now.

340
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:55,049
Later.
Let me sleep a while.

341
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:00,789
Who is it?

342
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,799
Hinomi, are you busy?

343
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:18,869
A bit.

344
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:20,014
Here.

345
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:23,570
When I was here, everyone
was so nice to me.

346
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:25,036
Take these fruits as
thanks.

347
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:27,411
My thanks to you all.

348
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:28,409
Thank you.

349
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:30,200
<i>The mainland police killed a
cigarette vendor, did you know that?</i>

350
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,434
<i>Yes, I heard.</i>

351
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:33,567
<i>- You too?
- Yes.</i>

352
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:37,580
The local people were furious.
The whole street was very tense.

353
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:39,080
Really furious.

354
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:40,810
Things were quite explosive.

355
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:42,280
The cigarettes were brought in as
contraband...

356
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:45,584
...by a senior official.

357
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:47,782
Bribery is rife.

358
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:52,795
They pursue the little fish but
leave the big fish alone.

359
00:38:58,302 --> 00:39:00,429
- We don't have to smoke.
- I do.

360
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:04,474
I can't go without cigarettes.

361
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:13,340
Cigarettes are not as
important as rice.

362
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:17,550
Prices are controlled by
Shanghai...

363
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:18,952
...to keep up their profits.

364
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:22,058
The civil servants don't only deal
in contraband cigarettes.

365
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,429
They don't care if we have
rice and sugar,

366
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:28,623
...only money.

367
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:33,933
Under the Japanese, times were hard
but we always had rice.

368
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:38,130
In less than a year,
rice has gone up 52%.

369
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,869
But have salaries gone up?

370
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:42,677
You are right.

371
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:46,677
Let's face it, this is not a government;
it's a private company.

372
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,444
Governor Chen Yi is filling...

373
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:52,656
...his own pockets,

374
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:54,520
...not yours.

375
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:56,350
Please, eat a little of the
rice dumpling.

376
00:39:57,862 --> 00:39:59,220
Hinomi made it.

377
00:39:59,225 --> 00:40:00,480
Thank you.

378
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:03,397
To tell the truth, that's not
the real problem.

379
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:12,272
The real problem
is unemployment.

380
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:13,343
You're right.

381
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:16,111
Since our return to China,

382
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:19,080
...many Taiwanese have lost
their jobs.

383
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:22,646
Many of them were
intellectuals...

384
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:26,945
...who weren't easily
pacified.

385
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:28,581
With no work,

386
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:32,756
...sooner or later
there's bound to be chaos.

387
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:34,728
And not only the intellectuals.

388
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:35,696
Soldiers too.

389
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,827
Yes, the soldiers conscripted by
Japan can't find work now.

390
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,637
Someone from the mainland took over
the court...

391
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:48,470
...throwing out the locals
and replacing them with...

392
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:52,337
...his own wife, uncle and nephew.

393
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,884
The court has been taken over
completely...

394
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:56,509
...by his family.

395
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:58,885
They follow his orders.

396
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,550
The Japanese gave you...

397
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:05,130
...a slave mentality.
You have to change.

398
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:07,200
We don't even know
how to speak Mandarin.

399
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:10,093
Slaves? Dammit.

400
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:12,999
Have we sunk so low as
to want to become slaves again?

401
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,602
The Ching Dynasty sold us out.

402
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:20,176
Who asked us if we wanted
to be ceded to Japan?

403
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:23,136
Drink up.

404
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,447
If the Nationalist Government...

405
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:30,812
...doesn't change its ways,

406
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,218
...even though we have won the war,

407
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:36,321
...our suffering will continue.

408
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:40,226
How long before we can lift up our
heads with pride?

409
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:41,092
Who knows?

410
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:42,062
We mustn't give up hope.

411
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:44,292
That would be a waste.

412
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,630
If we want a future,

413
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:52,202
...the suffering masses
have to resist.

414
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:56,278
If the Nationalists carry on letting
Chen Yi do what he wants,

415
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:59,146
...there'll be problems in Taiwan.

416
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:00,517
Lao He.

417
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:02,717
There certainly will, as soon as...

418
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:07,348
...Mr Ho makes ready his pen
to tell the tale.

419
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:11,600
You are our witness
from the mainland.

420
00:43:03,801 --> 00:43:08,801
It's a folksong called Lorelei,
based on a German legend.

421
00:43:26,802 --> 00:43:31,802
It's about a beautiful siren
seated on a rock in the Rhine.

422
00:43:31,803 --> 00:43:35,803
Sailors are so enchnated by
her singing,

423
00:43:35,804 --> 00:43:39,804
...that they crash their boats into
the rock and die.

424
00:44:04,105 --> 00:44:06,805
I first heard it when I was eight.

425
00:44:06,806 --> 00:44:12,806
I remember the goats bleating and
the voice of an actress in the Opera.

426
00:44:12,841 --> 00:44:16,806
I used to mimic her.
My teacher said I'd become an actor.

427
00:44:49,806 --> 00:44:53,806
I fell from a tree, hurt my head
and caught a fever.

428
00:44:53,807 --> 00:44:57,807
I couldn't walk and didn't
know I was deaf...

429
00:44:57,808 --> 00:45:01,773
...until my father wrote me.

430
00:45:01,808 --> 00:45:05,808
I was too young to
be upset by it.

431
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:06,048
What's the matter?

432
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:07,843
He has a fever.

433
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,213
Daddy loves you.

434
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,185
Wait for me downstairs.

435
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:16,925
Give him something for it.

436
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,125
And?

437
00:48:52,362 --> 00:48:53,522
Here it is.

438
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,000
Hello, Wen-heung.

439
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:58,940
Give.

440
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:00,802
Give it me!

441
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:12,706
What's this?

442
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:14,308
What is it?

443
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,351
How they fuck you!

444
00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:21,050
Tell your boss to come!

445
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:25,555
How they fuck you! Put it out.
Why are you smoking?

446
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:27,023
Put it out.

447
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:31,358
Are you blind? Can't you read!

448
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:33,362
Shit!

449
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:37,803
You want to die young.

450
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:39,938
How could you do that?

451
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:42,377
What do you think you're doing?

452
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:46,912
Bring your boss here!

453
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:48,314
Go and find your boss.

454
00:49:53,256 --> 00:49:56,817
Don't I give you enough money
for your expenses?

455
00:49:56,927 --> 00:49:58,690
If this gets out,

456
00:49:58,795 --> 00:50:00,763
...a lot of people could be hurt.

457
00:50:01,064 --> 00:50:03,396
And I could die!

458
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:05,932
I'll take responsibility.

459
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:07,968
You'll take responsibility?

460
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,003
How can you do that?

461
00:50:10,707 --> 00:50:14,165
It says here that Lin Wen-heung
is in charge of the goods.

462
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:19,879
You can't take responsibility.
Don't make me sick.

463
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:23,442
And you dress like those types
from Shanghai.

464
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:25,881
The latest fashion!

465
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:27,789
Layabout!

466
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:34,356
Where's Wen-leung?

467
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:36,891
I don't know.

468
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:38,900
You're together all day...

469
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:42,004
...and you say you don't know?

470
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,073
Speak up.

471
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:50,243
I really don't know.

472
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:02,589
Go and call Mr Ko.

473
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:14,365
Give me Taipei 24.

474
00:52:41,327 --> 00:52:42,294
Wen-leung.

475
00:52:43,863 --> 00:52:46,730
Your brother found out about
the last shipment.

476
00:52:47,033 --> 00:52:50,002
How could he know?

477
00:52:50,203 --> 00:52:51,500
You ask him.

478
00:52:52,172 --> 00:52:55,369
The shipment has been seized.

479
00:53:00,146 --> 00:53:01,238
Where is Ah-ga?

480
00:53:01,881 --> 00:53:03,508
Still at the warehouse.

481
00:53:32,979 --> 00:53:34,913
Does my brother know
I'm involved?

482
00:53:35,515 --> 00:53:38,484
I don't know. Ask Ah-ga.

483
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:46,300
Wen-leung,

484
00:53:46,926 --> 00:53:49,986
...now that your brother knows about it,

485
00:53:50,763 --> 00:53:53,254
...we have to go and speak to him.

486
00:54:02,876 --> 00:54:04,434
I must speak to Ag-ha first.

487
00:54:12,218 --> 00:54:14,015
What do we do now, boss?

488
00:54:14,487 --> 00:54:17,285
Let's wait for Wen-leung
to get things organized.

489
00:54:28,868 --> 00:54:30,267
Do you want to wash your hands?

490
00:54:31,104 --> 00:54:32,071
Please.

491
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:54,650
Excuse me.

492
00:54:55,194 --> 00:54:56,786
Thanks.

493
00:55:29,629 --> 00:55:30,823
What are you doing here?

494
00:55:32,732 --> 00:55:33,824
Aren't you Ah-tsun?

495
00:55:36,035 --> 00:55:37,832
No, you're mistaken.

496
00:55:38,404 --> 00:55:40,599
Wen-leung, what's going on?

497
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:53,680
We've met before, in Chiu-fen.

498
00:55:56,689 --> 00:56:00,591
Leave me alone. I told you
I'm not Ah-tsun.

499
00:56:01,928 --> 00:56:03,054
Her name is Ah-man.

500
00:56:03,796 --> 00:56:04,728
Leave us.

501
00:56:12,772 --> 00:56:16,572
Do you have Red Monkey's money?

502
00:56:17,043 --> 00:56:20,069
What are you saying?
Fool!

503
00:56:20,179 --> 00:56:21,407
What's this?

504
00:56:23,249 --> 00:56:26,548
Kim-tsua, it's none of your business.

505
00:56:26,653 --> 00:56:29,952
Not my business, eh?

506
00:56:30,223 --> 00:56:31,656
Leave us.

507
00:56:58,317 --> 00:57:01,081
Ah-ga, tell Wen-leung
to come here.

508
00:57:52,839 --> 00:57:55,330
Ungrateful boy!

509
00:57:57,910 --> 00:58:00,037
You came back from overseas.

510
00:58:01,447 --> 00:58:03,142
We gave you the chance
to reform.

511
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:05,745
But did you change? No.

512
00:58:06,552 --> 00:58:09,200
You are a lowlife,

513
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:11,560
...and your friends are lowlifes.

514
00:58:11,591 --> 00:58:14,890
Ah-shue, bring water.

515
00:58:15,261 --> 00:58:19,095
There's blood on you and in the room.
How do you think that'll be taken?

516
00:58:23,069 --> 00:58:24,559
I know.

517
00:58:26,305 --> 00:58:28,170
Look at your father!

518
00:58:30,243 --> 00:58:32,177
Did I ever annoy people...

519
00:58:32,979 --> 00:58:34,810
...in this district? No.

520
00:58:34,914 --> 00:58:37,007
Only the Japanese government.

521
00:58:38,451 --> 00:58:40,282
They called me a gangster.

522
00:58:42,889 --> 00:58:44,754
Me a gangster?

523
00:58:45,725 --> 00:58:48,888
The Japanese government
certainly hated me.

524
00:58:49,595 --> 00:58:52,655
<i>But it was only to help
the district.</i>

525
00:58:53,633 --> 00:58:56,796
<i>I turned big problems
into small ones,</i>

526
00:58:57,203 --> 00:59:00,536
<i>...and got rid of small ones.</i>

527
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:02,731
<i>I never stole anything from anyone,</i>

528
00:59:03,776 --> 00:59:07,007
<i>...and that's why the local gangs
supported me.</i>

529
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:13,408
<i>But you do nothing honestly.</i>

530
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,000
<i>It's always something dishonest.</i>

531
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:20,270
<i>Look at your daughter-in-law.</i>

532
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:24,600
<i>And at your brother.</i>

533
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:26,750
<i>And you, Wen-leung.</i>

534
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:28,800
<i>Have you fulfilled
your obligations?</i>

535
00:59:31,337 --> 00:59:34,966
Everything was clear at the beginning.

536
00:59:35,241 --> 00:59:37,209
Who'd have known they'd done this.

537
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:39,339
Didn't you speak to them about it?

538
00:59:39,445 --> 00:59:40,707
Of course.

539
00:59:42,381 --> 00:59:45,009
Let's gather everyone together
and clarify the issues.

540
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,300
Ah-chuan,

541
00:59:48,855 --> 00:59:51,415
...go tell your boss
I want to see him.

542
00:59:52,225 --> 00:59:55,683
This is disagreeable!

543
00:59:57,897 --> 01:00:01,663
Ah-ga, where are those fellows
from Shanghai?

544
01:00:02,068 --> 01:00:03,092
I haven't seen them.

545
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:05,296
Damn it!

546
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:12,439
It's Wen-leung again.

547
01:00:13,312 --> 01:00:15,280
As if we didn't have
enough problems.

548
01:00:16,182 --> 01:00:18,377
I don't know what to say.

549
01:00:38,604 --> 01:00:39,571
Leave me here.

550
01:00:45,311 --> 01:00:47,302
How are you?

551
01:00:48,781 --> 01:00:49,748
Where is your boss?

552
01:00:50,983 --> 01:00:52,143
He went out.

553
01:02:05,491 --> 01:02:06,617
Mrs Ah-Kio.

554
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:09,000
Take a seat please.

555
01:02:14,967 --> 01:02:18,459
You honour me by coming
to see me.

556
01:02:18,571 --> 01:02:21,005
It gives me hope.

557
01:02:21,941 --> 01:02:24,136
There's nothing that
can't be repaired.

558
01:02:24,844 --> 01:02:28,336
Everyone knows what
times we live in.

559
01:02:29,281 --> 01:02:32,580
You all grew up together.

560
01:02:33,319 --> 01:02:37,221
You shouldn't be
at odds over this.

561
01:02:42,828 --> 01:02:46,127
Our Kim-tsua began this,
so he's at fault.

562
01:02:47,233 --> 01:02:48,928
But the whole incident...

563
01:02:49,568 --> 01:02:53,527
...began with the return of Red Monkey's
Japanese money in Chiu-fen.

564
01:02:56,776 --> 01:02:58,437
Kim-tsua says...

565
01:02:58,911 --> 01:03:02,472
...that Red Monkey was
planning to cheat him,

566
01:03:03,482 --> 01:03:05,746
...and so he went to see him.

567
01:03:05,918 --> 01:03:07,852
Red Monkey didn't want
to return the money.

568
01:03:08,487 --> 01:03:09,977
That's how it all began.

569
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:13,322
Kim-tsua had a woman he liked there.

570
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:16,353
Maybe Kim-tsua was
in the wrong, but...

571
01:03:16,429 --> 01:03:19,091
...he would never lie to me.

572
01:03:21,934 --> 01:03:25,233
Red Monkey is dead,

573
01:03:25,604 --> 01:03:28,437
...and so can't give his
version of the story.

574
01:03:29,341 --> 01:03:32,970
This fighting and squabbling
must end!

575
01:03:33,112 --> 01:03:35,444
Have some tea.

576
01:03:43,789 --> 01:03:46,019
This entire conversation
makes no sense.

577
01:03:46,525 --> 01:03:50,928
The most important thing is to
take care of the money.

578
01:03:51,363 --> 01:03:54,696
I think it must be
split three ways.

579
01:03:54,967 --> 01:03:56,434
One part for your brother,

580
01:03:56,535 --> 01:03:58,025
...one for Kim-tsua...

581
01:03:58,737 --> 01:04:02,468
...and one for Red Monkey's
old mother.

582
01:05:21,987 --> 01:05:23,852
<i>Yesterday I went to Wen-ching's house,</i>

583
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:27,587
<i>...and so I didn't write in my diary.</i>

584
01:05:28,561 --> 01:05:31,758
<i>Wen-sun's wife
told me things...</i>

585
01:05:32,264 --> 01:05:34,789
<i>...about Wen-ching's childhood.</i>

586
01:05:35,601 --> 01:05:37,364
<i>Of the brothers, Wen-sun
studied the most,</i>

587
01:05:38,003 --> 01:05:41,905
<i>...but Wen-ching was
the most intelligent.</i>

588
01:05:42,641 --> 01:05:46,839
<i>He said his physical problems were due
to the gods being jealous.</i>

589
01:05:48,013 --> 01:05:50,038
<i>Wen-sun disappeared...</i>

590
01:05:50,149 --> 01:05:51,776
<i>...in the Philippines.</i>

591
01:05:52,551 --> 01:05:55,679
<i>His family don't think he'll return,</i>

592
01:05:55,955 --> 01:05:57,183
<i>...but his wife cleans...</i>

593
01:05:57,523 --> 01:06:00,890
<i>...his clinic every day.</i>

594
01:06:01,293 --> 01:06:03,454
<i>Every day she disinfects...</i>

595
01:06:03,862 --> 01:06:06,228
<i>...the needles and syringes.</i>

596
01:06:07,166 --> 01:06:11,227
<i>She thinks he's still alive...</i>

597
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:13,365
<i>...and that he'll come home one day.</i>

598
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:18,032
<i>Then everything will
be as it was.</i>

599
01:06:18,577 --> 01:06:20,477
<i>He'll look after his patients,</i>

600
01:06:20,646 --> 01:06:23,240
<i>...write prescriptions, do injections,</i>

601
01:06:23,649 --> 01:06:26,516
<i>...listen to music...
to Beethoven.</i>

602
01:07:49,168 --> 01:07:50,227
Brother.

603
01:07:50,302 --> 01:07:51,064
Who's down below?

604
01:07:51,170 --> 01:07:54,071
Soldiers from the mainland.
Get away.

605
01:07:54,173 --> 01:07:56,300
What do they want with me?

606
01:07:56,408 --> 01:07:58,672
Hurry up and get out.

607
01:07:59,078 --> 01:07:59,840
What's going on?

608
01:07:59,945 --> 01:08:02,709
They have come for Wen-heung.

609
01:08:03,048 --> 01:08:04,106
They have come for us.

610
01:08:04,316 --> 01:08:05,442
Go back to bed!

611
01:08:22,368 --> 01:08:24,359
This is breaking and entering.

612
01:08:24,370 --> 01:08:25,195
Search for him.

613
01:08:25,204 --> 01:08:30,369
They told us your son
was a collaborator.

614
01:08:30,509 --> 01:08:31,999
My son, a collaborator?

615
01:08:32,644 --> 01:08:34,009
Somebody denounced him.

616
01:08:34,113 --> 01:08:36,581
And that makes him a traitor?

617
01:08:36,682 --> 01:08:39,082
We have to take him in for interrogation
to find out the truth.

618
01:08:45,089 --> 01:08:46,324
Do you eat fish all day?

619
01:08:46,425 --> 01:08:48,359
What kind of mayor are you?

620
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:50,628
It's not easy for us.

621
01:08:50,829 --> 01:08:52,694
Then you'll never find out
the truth.

622
01:08:52,798 --> 01:08:54,629
Someone denounced him.

623
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,768
If that makes you a collaborator,

624
01:08:56,869 --> 01:08:58,666
...then I'm a gangster.

625
01:08:59,471 --> 01:09:03,771
I went in and out of prison
during the Japanese occupation.

626
01:09:04,176 --> 01:09:05,438
You have to find out the truth.

627
01:09:05,544 --> 01:09:06,977
How does that make him
a traitor?

628
01:09:07,079 --> 01:09:08,603
We'll investigate.

629
01:09:08,714 --> 01:09:10,443
Investigate? What does that mean?

630
01:09:17,456 --> 01:09:22,052
If he's a traitor,
then we all are!

631
01:09:22,294 --> 01:09:24,194
We'll make a full
investigation.

632
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:27,855
My son and I are gangsters,

633
01:09:27,966 --> 01:09:29,627
...I admit it.

634
01:09:29,735 --> 01:09:32,533
But only for the good of
the entire district.

635
01:09:33,172 --> 01:09:36,232
So as not to be intimidated
by the Japanese.

636
01:09:36,341 --> 01:09:37,638
If that's being a collaborator,

637
01:09:37,743 --> 01:09:40,268
...then you are one too.

638
01:09:40,512 --> 01:09:42,707
Officer, the man who denounced him
is the collaborator.

639
01:09:45,150 --> 01:09:48,051
You can't arrest everyone
who is denounced.

640
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:49,881
Who are you kidding?

641
01:09:52,024 --> 01:09:53,355
Wen-leung!

642
01:10:42,341 --> 01:10:43,569
<i>"Dear uncle:</i>

643
01:10:44,009 --> 01:10:47,501
<i>...yesterday soldiers arrested
Wen-leung.</i>

644
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:51,613
<i>They also went to the office
to arrest father...</i>

645
01:10:52,384 --> 01:10:56,718
<i>...but he escaped,
and only injured a leg.</i>

646
01:10:58,090 --> 01:10:59,580
<i>They say someone denounced
Wen-leung...</i>

647
01:10:59,691 --> 01:11:03,855
<i>...and said he was
a collaborator.</i>

648
01:11:04,830 --> 01:11:06,764
<i>They say he helped the Japanese...</i>

649
01:11:06,865 --> 01:11:10,460
<i>...capture many people in Shanghai.</i>

650
01:11:11,937 --> 01:11:16,033
<i>Even if were true, they must
have forced him to do it.</i>

651
01:11:21,246 --> 01:11:23,771
<i>Mother says you have friends
in Taipei.</i>

652
01:11:24,182 --> 01:11:28,846
<i>Do you know anyone who might be able
to secure his freedom?</i>

653
01:11:29,521 --> 01:11:31,284
<i>We have money.</i>

654
01:11:32,124 --> 01:11:34,718
<i>Please help us and get in touch
with us as soon as possible.</i>

<i>Ah-shue".</i>

656
01:11:43,268 --> 01:11:44,200
I know.

657
01:11:46,171 --> 01:11:48,162
Are you looking for Mr Chen,
the town councillor?

658
01:11:49,841 --> 01:11:53,038
It doesn't matter. We need your help.

659
01:11:53,545 --> 01:11:54,876
Why does it have to be like this?

660
01:11:58,350 --> 01:12:00,978
It's OK. If that's how you think,
forget it.

661
01:12:05,057 --> 01:12:06,149
<i>I'll prepare it.</i>

662
01:12:11,229 --> 01:12:12,594
<i>I know. Someone will deliver it.</i>

663
01:12:13,265 --> 01:12:14,197
Mum.

664
01:12:14,333 --> 01:12:15,630
We have guests.

665
01:12:15,734 --> 01:12:16,792
I'm coming.

666
01:12:23,241 --> 01:12:24,538
They'll free him?

667
01:12:25,277 --> 01:12:26,266
They'll free Wen-leung?

668
01:12:26,378 --> 01:12:29,643
Not yet, but I think
it will turn out well.

669
01:12:30,182 --> 01:12:32,616
Why haven't they released him?

670
01:12:34,453 --> 01:12:39,049
Friends in Taipei have made
enquiries. Nanking says...

671
01:12:39,291 --> 01:12:42,783
...that charges against Taiwanese
of collaboration will be withdrawn.

672
01:12:42,894 --> 01:12:44,555
So I don't think there'll
be any problems.

673
01:12:44,997 --> 01:12:47,830
But first they have to
announce...

674
01:12:47,933 --> 01:12:50,629
...the new regulations.

675
01:12:50,736 --> 01:12:51,964
You must help us!

676
01:12:52,070 --> 01:12:54,732
Calm down.

677
01:12:57,509 --> 01:13:01,172
Maybe friends in Taipei will be able...

678
01:13:01,279 --> 01:13:04,248
...to obtain his release earlier.

679
01:13:04,383 --> 01:13:08,149
Please, call your brother.

680
01:13:08,387 --> 01:13:09,880
ÉHe'll know what to do.

681
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,000
Right.

682
01:13:23,835 --> 01:13:27,202
Get me Taipei 24.

683
01:13:37,849 --> 01:13:39,407
Please, do all you can.

684
01:13:44,256 --> 01:13:45,689
Thanks, thanks.

685
01:13:57,235 --> 01:13:58,361
And?

686
01:14:00,872 --> 01:14:03,898
They say the law on collaboration
is going to be changed.

687
01:14:04,509 --> 01:14:05,874
Damn.

688
01:14:06,745 --> 01:14:09,908
They make laws, and they change laws.

689
01:14:10,382 --> 01:14:12,077
This island is in a bad way.

690
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:14,616
First the Japanese,
then the Chinese.

691
01:14:15,053 --> 01:14:18,022
They all exploit us and
no one gives a damn.

692
01:14:57,523 --> 01:14:59,523
- What's going on?
- It's urgent.

693
01:15:00,024 --> 01:15:01,524
OK, we'll talk later.

694
01:15:26,710 --> 01:15:27,600
Brother.

695
01:15:32,898 --> 01:15:34,024
Sit down.

696
01:15:39,504 --> 01:15:40,596
Sit down, please.

697
01:15:56,988 --> 01:15:58,148
I am sorry to trouble you...

698
01:15:59,491 --> 01:16:01,584
...while you are enjoying yourselves.

699
01:16:03,094 --> 01:16:06,495
My brother has been arrested
and imprisoned.

700
01:16:07,666 --> 01:16:10,760
You know people
in power.

701
01:16:11,369 --> 01:16:12,734
I need your help.

702
01:16:14,673 --> 01:16:17,039
Can you arrange for him to be
set free for New Year?

703
01:16:18,343 --> 01:16:21,278
Wen-heung is sorry to bother you,

704
01:16:21,513 --> 01:16:23,777
...but his brother has been arrested.

705
01:16:23,882 --> 01:16:27,716
He'd like your help so he
can be released for New Year.

706
01:16:29,821 --> 01:16:32,346
They want Wen-leung...

707
01:16:32,457 --> 01:16:35,221
...to be released before New Year.

708
01:16:37,529 --> 01:16:40,089
When did they arrest him?
I knew nothing of this.

709
01:16:42,901 --> 01:16:44,163
I didn't know either.

710
01:16:45,337 --> 01:16:48,397
They didn't know Wen-leung
had been arrested.

711
01:16:48,506 --> 01:16:50,497
How can we help?

712
01:16:52,410 --> 01:16:55,106
Hippocrites! It's all your fault!

713
01:16:55,213 --> 01:16:56,805
Shut up!

714
01:16:58,316 --> 01:16:59,806
Idiot!

715
01:16:59,985 --> 01:17:01,577
Can't you keep
your mouth shut?

716
01:17:14,199 --> 01:17:15,291
Tell them...

717
01:17:16,902 --> 01:17:18,460
...that I know what to do.

718
01:17:21,006 --> 01:17:22,496
It's all fixed.

719
01:17:23,074 --> 01:17:25,668
He says he knows
the rules.

720
01:17:25,944 --> 01:17:27,172
It's all there.

721
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:13,200
He's back!

722
01:18:14,660 --> 01:18:15,700
He's back!

723
01:18:18,530 --> 01:18:19,462
Put him down here.

724
01:18:24,970 --> 01:18:25,959
Wen-leung!

725
01:18:26,204 --> 01:18:27,432
Bring medicines,

726
01:18:28,139 --> 01:18:29,265
...a container and a spoon!

727
01:18:29,474 --> 01:18:30,566
Wen-leung,

728
01:18:30,909 --> 01:18:33,002
...how could they have
beat you like that?

729
01:18:37,415 --> 01:18:39,383
Hurry, fetch a doctor!

730
01:18:42,654 --> 01:18:44,349
Calm down.

731
01:18:44,522 --> 01:18:46,649
Crying won't help.

732
01:18:48,693 --> 01:18:49,785
Calm down.

733
01:18:51,730 --> 01:18:53,163
Bring water.

734
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,297
<i>Am I talking to the clinic?</i>

735
01:18:57,035 --> 01:19:02,166
<i>Is the doctor there?
Please, hurry up.</i>

736
01:19:02,273 --> 01:19:03,706
Open your mouth.

737
01:19:18,023 --> 01:19:19,718
Why is there so much blood?

738
01:19:20,625 --> 01:19:22,024
He was OK in the car.

739
01:19:22,127 --> 01:19:25,028
The vibrations must have made
him lose blood.

740
01:19:25,263 --> 01:19:26,560
Damn.

741
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:29,765
Did you call?

742
01:19:29,868 --> 01:19:30,596
Yes.

743
01:19:30,802 --> 01:19:32,235
I'll call again.

744
01:19:33,004 --> 01:19:34,028
Open your mouth.

745
01:19:37,042 --> 01:19:39,135
<i>Get me the Hui-an Clinic.</i>

746
01:19:40,945 --> 01:19:42,572
Tell him it's urgent!

747
01:19:42,607 --> 01:19:43,773
OK!

748
01:19:43,874 --> 01:19:45,774
Is that the clinic?

749
01:19:46,275 --> 01:19:47,375
I'm calling from "Little Shanghai".

750
01:19:47,576 --> 01:19:48,576
Is the doctor on his way?

751
01:22:58,309 --> 01:23:00,277
I don't know why,

752
01:23:01,646 --> 01:23:03,580
...but I have had a lot of
bad dreams lately.

753
01:23:04,849 --> 01:23:05,907
They were about dad...

754
01:23:06,017 --> 01:23:10,078
...tying me to a telegraph
pole when I was a boy.

755
01:23:17,795 --> 01:23:18,819
Did you boil the water?

756
01:23:20,932 --> 01:23:21,899
Yes.

757
01:23:30,642 --> 01:23:32,473
I remember.

758
01:23:33,678 --> 01:23:35,305
It was just before New Year.

759
01:23:36,581 --> 01:23:40,176
When my father was young,
he loved gambling.

760
01:23:42,086 --> 01:23:44,316
We had no money and mum...

761
01:23:44,422 --> 01:23:47,220
...took out a gold necklace...

762
01:23:47,692 --> 01:23:49,421
...and asked dad
to pawn it.

763
01:23:51,229 --> 01:23:53,322
My mother was afraid that dad...

764
01:23:54,966 --> 01:23:58,925
...would gamble away the money
and sent me with him.

765
01:23:59,671 --> 01:24:04,608
As soon as my father had the
money in his hand,

766
01:24:04,709 --> 01:24:08,042
...he persuaded me to stand
next to a telegraph pole.

767
01:24:10,081 --> 01:24:13,812
He then tied me to it with his belt
and went off to bet.

768
01:24:15,153 --> 01:24:17,519
It was December and
very cold.

769
01:24:20,191 --> 01:24:22,125
No one went by.

770
01:24:24,162 --> 01:24:26,153
It was almost 9 before someone...

771
01:24:26,264 --> 01:24:28,892
...saw me and untied me.

772
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:31,163
I almost died of the cold.

773
01:24:33,171 --> 01:24:36,800
After that, whenever
mum asked me...

774
01:24:36,908 --> 01:24:39,433
...to go with dad, I refused.

01:28:50,029 --> 01:28:54,830
<i>First, regarding those involved...</i>

817
01:28:54,967 --> 01:28:59,529
<i>...the government will not go ahead...</i>

818
01:28:59,639 --> 01:29:01,800
<i>...and punish them.</i>

819
01:29:02,341 --> 01:29:05,538
<i>Second, those arrested...</i>

820
01:29:05,678 --> 01:29:08,511
<i>...for taking part in the disorder,</i>

821
01:29:08,681 --> 01:29:10,080
<i>...will be set free.</i>

822
01:29:10,483 --> 01:29:13,680
<i>They'll be taken to police
headquarters...</i>

823
01:29:13,786 --> 01:29:17,153
<i>...where their families will be able
to come by and look for them.</i>

824
01:29:17,256 --> 01:29:20,191
<i>To make things simpler,</i>

825
01:29:20,326 --> 01:29:22,556
<i>...mayors will issue no guarantees.</i>

826
01:29:23,329 --> 01:29:26,389
<i>Third, the wounded
and the dead...</i>

827
01:29:26,699 --> 01:29:29,395
<i>...whatever their jobs,</i>

828
01:29:29,502 --> 01:29:32,437
<i>...whether Taiwanese or mainlanders,</i>

829
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:37,541
<i>...will receive medical attention or
appropriate compensation.</i>

830
01:29:37,877 --> 01:29:42,041
<i>Fourth, a special committee...</i>

831
01:29:42,181 --> 01:29:44,945
<i>...will be set up.</i>

832
01:29:45,284 --> 01:29:48,617
<i>It will consist of
representatives of the government,</i>

833
01:29:48,754 --> 01:29:51,780
<i>...the judicial and
municipal authorities.</i>

834
01:29:52,124 --> 01:29:55,457
<i>It will also include
members of the public...</i>

835
01:29:56,028 --> 01:30:00,931
<i>...with the aim of reflecting
true public opinion.</i>

836
01:30:11,410 --> 01:30:12,638
What are you doing here?

837
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:14,350
And my brother?

838
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:48,200
Doctor! Come quickly!

839
01:30:58,758 --> 01:31:00,225
<i>Citizens of Taiwan:</i>

840
01:31:01,193 --> 01:31:04,458
<i>Yesterday saw the temporary
reintroduction of martial law.</i>

841
01:31:05,364 --> 01:31:10,101
<i>I want to assure all those of you
who love peace,</i>

842
01:31:12,738 --> 01:31:14,638
<i>...that this decree is...</i>

843
01:31:15,407 --> 01:31:17,807
<i>...for your protection.</i>

844
01:31:18,944 --> 01:31:22,539
<i>Take no notice of rumours
about spies,</i>

845
01:31:22,982 --> 01:31:26,315
<i>...because suspicion
leads to fear.</i>

846
01:31:27,086 --> 01:31:28,849
<i>I assure all
citizens...</i>

847
01:31:29,255 --> 01:31:33,282
<i>...who obey the law,
that nothing will happen to them.</i>

848
01:31:35,161 --> 01:31:37,561
<i>Meanwhile, I am announcing
the reintroduction of martial law.</i>

849
01:31:38,130 --> 01:31:43,033
<i>Our objective is merely to punish
rebels and traitors.</i>

850
01:31:43,969 --> 01:31:45,732
<i>For every day they are
at large,</i>

851
01:31:46,305 --> 01:31:50,401
<i>...peaceloving people will have
to put up with another day of disorder.</i>

852
01:33:00,302 --> 01:33:03,502
<i>Hinoe is safe.
She asked me to come first.</i>

853
01:33:03,503 --> 01:33:06,503
<i>Mr Lin, the teacher, is
in the special committeel.</i>

854
01:33:06,504 --> 01:33:10,004
<i>Many in Taipei died.
People are frightened.</i>

855
01:33:26,672 --> 01:33:27,832
Dead?

856
01:34:03,609 --> 01:34:05,042
Where are you from?

857
01:34:07,646 --> 01:34:08,977
Where are you from?

858
01:34:10,883 --> 01:34:11,872
Where are you going?

859
01:34:18,223 --> 01:34:19,622
I am... Taiwanese.

860
01:34:21,740 --> 01:34:23,700
Are you from Japan?

861
01:34:27,235 --> 01:34:28,885
Are you from Japan?

862
01:34:31,937 --> 01:34:33,097
Must be a mainlander.

863
01:34:33,339 --> 01:34:34,271
What are you doing?

864
01:34:38,744 --> 01:34:39,904
He is deaf.

865
01:34:41,113 --> 01:34:43,741
He can't hear
what you are saying.

866
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:08,350
Wen-ching.

867
01:35:11,580 --> 01:35:13,200
Wen-ching.

868
01:35:59,224 --> 01:36:00,714
What's the matter, brother?

869
01:36:09,768 --> 01:36:11,668
Is it fractured?

870
01:36:15,808 --> 01:36:17,435
I don't know.

871
01:36:49,842 --> 01:36:51,503
Lin has disappeared.

872
01:36:52,144 --> 01:36:54,704
They've arrested everyone
in the special committee.

873
01:36:57,249 --> 01:36:59,012
The troops of Chen Yi...

874
01:36:59,118 --> 01:37:01,086
...are killing and arresting people.

875
01:38:23,502 --> 01:38:26,062
Your son has come back, ma'am.

876
01:38:33,912 --> 01:38:36,176
You are back!
I was so worried.

877
01:38:36,548 --> 01:38:39,381
Soldiers and police
came here every day.

878
01:38:39,985 --> 01:38:42,385
They were right on the doorstep.

879
01:38:47,492 --> 01:38:49,187
What's wrong with your foot?

880
01:38:52,598 --> 01:38:54,122
Is it serious?

881
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:12,543
What are you doing? It's good
that he's back!

882
01:39:13,885 --> 01:39:17,116
You can't stay here.
I'll hide you in Lai-Liao.

883
01:39:17,889 --> 01:39:18,787
Hinomi,

884
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:21,415
...I forbid you to leave the house.

885
01:39:21,526 --> 01:39:23,721
I'll write to the hospital.

886
01:39:43,282 --> 01:39:48,185
<i>On 19th March,
the director of the hospital,</i>

887
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:50,515
<i>...took all my things.</i>

888
01:39:51,623 --> 01:39:54,751
<i>It was my father's idea.</i>

889
01:39:58,697 --> 01:40:02,292
<i>There was a letter from Ah-shue.</i>

890
01:40:03,835 --> 01:40:05,894
<i>Wen-ching has been arrested.</i>

891
01:40:06,471 --> 01:40:08,496
<i>They say it was for Mr Lin.</i>

892
01:40:12,010 --> 01:40:13,875
<i>Wen-ching's father went around
shouting:</i>

893
01:40:14,513 --> 01:40:18,779
<i>"They are even arresting the deaf. Where
is justice in this world?"</i>

894
01:40:19,985 --> 01:40:21,919
<i>Justice is not important to me.</i>

895
01:40:22,354 --> 01:40:25,255
<i>I only want to know...</i>

896
01:40:26,258 --> 01:40:27,953
<i>...where Wen-ching is.</i>

897
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:30,926
<i>I only want to know...</i>

898
01:40:31,463 --> 01:40:33,124
<i>...if he's alive and well.</i>

899
01:41:53,311 --> 01:41:56,144
Wu Chin-wen, Tai Tung-ho,
to court.

900
01:44:56,161 --> 01:44:58,095
Lin Wen-ching, to court!

901
01:47:33,585 --> 01:47:37,077
Uncle, it's supper time.

902
01:49:16,478 --> 01:49:20,778
<i>Face the world
without shame.</i>

903
01:49:25,279 --> 01:49:28,879
<i>Your father is innocent.</i>

904
01:49:45,580 --> 01:49:50,880
<i>At this time
of difficulty...</i>

905
01:49:59,481 --> 01:50:04,981
<i>I am apart from my loved one...</i>

906
01:51:04,362 --> 01:51:07,661
Uncle,you can't eat that.

907
01:51:07,765 --> 01:51:09,096
You mustn't!

908
01:51:22,046 --> 01:51:22,978
Wen-leung.

909
01:51:28,252 --> 01:51:29,241
Where is Wen-ching?

910
01:51:29,487 --> 01:51:32,684
He went out yesterday
and hasn't come back.

911
01:51:33,124 --> 01:51:34,182
And your father?

912
01:51:34,359 --> 01:51:36,725
No idea. He went out this morning.

913
01:52:36,245 --> 01:52:39,043
Ah-shue, where are your parents?

914
01:52:40,049 --> 01:52:42,244
They left this morning.

915
01:52:43,686 --> 01:52:48,680
Dad usually comes home late, drunk.

916
01:52:48,891 --> 01:52:51,792
He staggers and vomits
all over the house.

917
01:52:56,599 --> 01:52:58,226
When did your father's club close?

918
01:52:58,401 --> 01:52:59,629
In March.

919
01:52:59,735 --> 01:53:02,033
It was chaotic for a while.

920
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:03,930
Many people died,

921
01:53:04,340 --> 01:53:06,240
...and the neighborhood was wrecked.

922
01:53:08,945 --> 01:53:12,642
Dad's friend, Mr Ko, was arrested.

923
01:53:12,748 --> 01:53:13,680
Ah-shue!

924
01:53:53,656 --> 01:53:55,886
Aunt Hinomi, uncle has returned.

925
01:53:59,362 --> 01:54:01,626
We waited a long time, but he knew...

926
01:54:01,964 --> 01:54:04,057
...which station exit to take.

927
01:54:27,456 --> 01:54:28,252
Ah-shue,

928
01:54:28,491 --> 01:54:29,924
...look for your brothers.

929
01:54:35,798 --> 01:54:37,231
Take your time and write.

930
01:54:42,705 --> 01:54:45,469
Uncle, you cannot eat that.

931
01:54:46,943 --> 01:54:48,604
It's food for the altar.

932
01:54:53,249 --> 01:54:54,443
You can't eat it.

933
01:55:16,544 --> 01:55:20,544
<i>You are thinner.
Are you OK?</i>

934
01:55:20,545 --> 01:55:24,545
<i>My brother disappeared.
He was hiding in Lai-liao.</i>

935
01:55:24,546 --> 01:55:29,546
<i>One day soldiers came.
Since then, we have had no news.</i>

936
01:57:56,825 --> 01:57:58,238
Wen-ching!

937
01:57:59,650 --> 01:58:00,638
Wen-ching!

938
01:58:28,898 --> 01:58:30,263
Here comes Mr Huang.

939
01:58:33,335 --> 01:58:37,271
Mr Huang, this is
my good friend Wen-ching.

940
01:58:42,111 --> 01:58:44,170
He was in prison with your brother...

941
01:58:44,280 --> 01:58:47,613
...before he was executed.

942
01:58:48,017 --> 01:58:50,178
He has come especially to see you.

943
01:58:52,325 --> 01:58:53,100
Sit down.

944
01:59:26,801 --> 01:59:29,801
<i>"In life, far from the motherland.</i>

945
01:59:29,802 --> 01:59:32,802
<i>"In death, returning to the motherland.</i>

946
01:59:32,803 --> 01:59:36,803
<i>"Both life and death
are governed by destiny. "</i>

947
02:00:33,004 --> 02:00:35,804
<i>Hinoe got married and
lives in the mountains.</i>

948
02:00:35,805 --> 02:00:39,805
<i>I can't tell you where.
She doesn't want her family to know.</i>

949
02:00:39,806 --> 02:00:43,806
<i>She said, "Consider me dead.
My life belongs to the motherland.</i>

950
02:00:43,807 --> 02:00:47,807
<i>"In prison, I swore to live, for
the sake of friends who had died. "</i>

951
02:01:54,808 --> 02:01:59,808
<i>I cannot live like before.
I want to stay here.</i>

952
02:01:59,809 --> 02:02:04,809
<i>I know I can do whatever you ask me.</i>

953
02:02:04,810 --> 02:02:08,010
<i>This is no place for you.</i>

954
02:02:25,211 --> 02:02:30,611
<i>What's important are your beliefs,
not where you live or what you do.</i>

955
02:02:32,212 --> 02:02:37,712
<i>They suggested marriage to Hinomi,
but it's you she loves.</i>

956
02:03:30,599 --> 02:03:33,295
Let me introduce my best friend,
Wen-ching.

957
02:05:35,924 --> 02:05:37,448
Are you going to reopen
for business or not?

958
02:05:39,595 --> 02:05:40,584
Enough!

959
02:05:40,796 --> 02:05:42,457
Go and play outside

960
02:05:42,564 --> 02:05:44,725
Wen-leung, this is for the altar.

961
02:05:44,833 --> 02:05:47,529
Eat after the prayers.

962
02:05:49,171 --> 02:05:52,800
You decided to close.

963
02:05:52,908 --> 02:05:55,274
Now you won't say
when you'll reopen.

964
02:05:55,377 --> 02:05:56,639
Can't you make up your mind?

965
02:05:58,413 --> 02:05:59,345
Shut up!

966
02:05:59,681 --> 02:06:00,978
Don't argue with me!

967
02:06:06,421 --> 02:06:08,048
Don't drink from the teapot!

968
02:06:08,290 --> 02:06:09,780
You're setting a bad example
to the children!

969
02:06:10,192 --> 02:06:12,387
You're too big for such things.

970
02:06:18,634 --> 02:06:19,965
Are you thirsty?

971
02:06:23,939 --> 02:06:27,102
Drink properly or not at all.
Don't be ridiculous.

972
02:06:33,982 --> 02:06:35,142
Look!

973
02:06:35,450 --> 02:06:38,419
You were gone for days,
God knows where!

974
02:06:38,787 --> 02:06:42,086
You either lock yourself in your room
or hide out where...

975
02:06:42,190 --> 02:06:43,680
...nobody can find you.

976
02:06:44,159 --> 02:06:48,323
I wanted you to visit mother's grave
with me. Where were you?

977
02:06:49,464 --> 02:06:51,329
That's why I have such bad luck!

978
02:06:52,167 --> 02:06:55,000
I am the only one
of the four children...

979
02:06:55,103 --> 02:06:58,197
...who visits mum's grave.
She asks me why,

980
02:06:58,941 --> 02:07:02,069
...and I don't lack for words.
As for you,

981
02:07:02,477 --> 02:07:04,707
...how long do you think you can go
without working?

982
02:07:06,815 --> 02:07:11,912
I planned to open a photographic studio
on the side so you could run it.

983
02:07:12,654 --> 02:07:14,121
We discussed it enough.

984
02:07:14,790 --> 02:07:17,691
When will you give me an answer?

985
02:07:17,826 --> 02:07:20,351
How can he reply? He can't hear.

986
02:07:20,495 --> 02:07:22,053
Shut up!

987
02:07:22,531 --> 02:07:25,796
The only thing you know
is to tell people off.

988
02:07:27,903 --> 02:07:30,303
Ah-shue,you tell him.

989
02:07:36,044 --> 02:07:38,535
When a young woman visits us,

990
02:07:38,613 --> 02:07:41,013
...without thinking of her dignity,

991
02:07:41,116 --> 02:07:44,677
...it's obvious what's going on.
Don't you understand?

992
02:07:45,721 --> 02:07:47,985
What are you waiting for?

993
02:08:07,809 --> 02:08:10,505
What's all the row?
Stop singing!

994
02:08:18,950 --> 02:08:19,750
Damn it!

995
02:08:20,422 --> 02:08:21,650
Shut up!

996
02:08:22,891 --> 02:08:26,190
What's all this howling?

997
02:08:29,264 --> 02:08:32,791
You are like bad spirits.
What's all the noise?

998
02:08:33,435 --> 02:08:35,630
Why are you shouting?

999
02:08:37,272 --> 02:08:41,208
Can't you talk normally?

1000
02:08:44,646 --> 02:08:45,806
What's going on?

1001
02:08:50,819 --> 02:08:55,017
It's useless. He seems incapable
of acting normally.

1002
02:08:57,225 --> 02:08:58,590
I'm sorry.

1003
02:08:59,561 --> 02:09:00,960
Please, carry on singing.

1004
02:09:03,231 --> 02:09:04,357
No, thank you.

1005
02:09:06,234 --> 02:09:07,997
Take no notice of him.

1006
02:09:08,103 --> 02:09:11,630
You sing very well.

1007
02:09:12,350 --> 02:09:13,950
Please, carry on.

1008
02:09:13,975 --> 02:09:15,442
He's as stubborn as a mule!

1009
02:09:15,544 --> 02:09:18,377
People like him
can't be taught anything.

1010
02:11:15,210 --> 02:11:16,010
Damn you!

1011
02:11:17,499 --> 02:11:20,366
How come you're not dead?

1012
02:11:21,136 --> 02:11:23,263
You really made Wen-leung
suffer.

1013
02:11:23,371 --> 02:11:24,838
Shame on you!

1014
02:11:30,078 --> 02:11:31,602
So?

1015
02:11:34,649 --> 02:11:35,479
What's up?

1016
02:11:35,584 --> 02:11:37,347
What's up?

1017
02:11:37,852 --> 02:11:40,878
You know what you did.

1018
02:11:41,423 --> 02:11:45,553
Shut up or you'll be sorry.

1019
02:11:45,660 --> 02:11:47,025
What will you do about it?

1020
02:11:48,563 --> 02:11:49,427
What?

1021
02:11:49,598 --> 02:11:50,792
Calm down.

1022
02:11:50,899 --> 02:11:52,127
You don't scare me.

1023
02:11:54,302 --> 02:11:55,496
Pig!

1024
02:11:55,604 --> 02:11:57,435
You'll come to a bad end
one of these days.

1025
02:13:07,509 --> 02:13:08,567
Older brother!
Older brother!

1026
02:13:12,113 --> 02:13:15,446
Ah-ga.

1027
02:13:16,584 --> 02:13:17,414
Call a doctor!

1028
02:13:17,519 --> 02:13:18,679
What happened?

1029
02:13:30,532 --> 02:13:32,727
Kim-tsua, take that knife.

1030
02:13:33,501 --> 02:13:34,729
Call a doctor.

1031
02:13:59,327 --> 02:14:00,259
Wen-heung!

1032
02:16:37,085 --> 02:16:38,347
Here comes the bride.

1033
02:16:41,122 --> 02:16:45,320
Let's ask our ancestors...

1034
02:16:54,369 --> 02:16:55,700
...for children and wealth.

1035
02:17:12,520 --> 02:17:13,851
Bow to the ancestors.

1036
02:17:27,936 --> 02:17:28,960
Kneel down.

1037
02:17:33,808 --> 02:17:34,900
Pray.

1038
02:17:36,911 --> 02:17:38,208
First reverence.

1039
02:17:41,583 --> 02:17:43,073
Two.

1040
02:17:45,253 --> 02:17:46,550
Three.

1041
02:17:49,157 --> 02:17:50,249
Pray.

1042
02:17:52,226 --> 02:17:53,557
Four.

1043
02:17:56,531 --> 02:17:57,691
Five.

1044
02:18:00,535 --> 02:18:01,763
Six.

1045
02:18:04,172 --> 02:18:05,366
Pray.

1046
02:18:07,108 --> 02:18:08,439
Seven.

1047
02:18:11,379 --> 02:18:12,676
Eight.

1048
02:18:15,216 --> 02:18:16,706
Nine.

1049
02:18:18,853 --> 02:18:20,320
Stand up.

1050
02:18:24,125 --> 02:18:25,854
Bow to each other.

1051
02:18:30,264 --> 02:18:31,526
Kneel.

1052
02:18:37,980 --> 02:18:40,340
Bride and groom, bow
to each other three times.

1053
02:18:40,400 --> 02:18:41,950
One.

1054
02:18:44,680 --> 02:18:46,080
Two.

1055
02:18:47,700 --> 02:18:49,100
Three.

1056
02:18:50,250 --> 02:18:51,650
Stand up.

1057
02:22:43,851 --> 02:22:45,216
<i>It's late.</i>

1058
02:22:45,620 --> 02:22:47,918
<i>I heard the first thunder
of spring.</i>

1059
02:22:48,322 --> 02:22:52,053
<i>One clap after another,</i>

1060
02:22:52,760 --> 02:22:56,196
<i>...as if waking the hillsides
and the sea.</i>

1061
02:22:59,734 --> 02:23:02,362
<i>Someone came from the mountains.</i>

1062
02:23:02,803 --> 02:23:05,203
<i>He said my brother
needed money.</i>

1063
02:23:05,439 --> 02:23:07,498
<i>He needed it...</i>

1064
02:23:07,608 --> 02:23:10,577
<i>...to print pamphlets
to educate people.</i>

1065
02:23:11,045 --> 02:23:14,947
<i>The man said they didn't want
to be always asking...</i>

1066
02:23:15,349 --> 02:23:18,876
<i>...for help from Weng-ching.</i>

1067
02:23:19,353 --> 02:23:21,321
<i>But only when they come
to ask for money,</i>

1068
02:23:21,656 --> 02:23:24,591
<i>...do we know that they're safe
and that the struggle continues.</i>

1069
02:23:24,992 --> 02:23:28,723
<i>Only then are we satisfied.</i>

1070
02:23:32,166 --> 02:23:33,997
<i>Ah-chien can already make sounds.</i>

1071
02:23:34,101 --> 02:23:36,535
<i>Last night I thought
he was saying "mummy. "</i>

1072
02:23:37,338 --> 02:23:41,035
<i>I was so happy.</i>

1073
02:23:41,142 --> 02:23:43,406
<i>I hurried to find Wen-ching...</i>

1074
02:23:43,811 --> 02:23:45,540
<i>...so he could hear too.</i>

1075
02:23:45,746 --> 02:23:49,546
<i>It was only when I saw him I realized
my stupidity. How could he hear?</i>

1076
02:24:08,669 --> 02:24:10,364
<i>Prices are rising.</i>

1077
02:24:10,805 --> 02:24:13,899
<i>The neighbours say
times will be hard.</i>

1078
02:24:14,275 --> 02:24:16,140
<i>Maybe I'm a fool.</i>

1079
02:24:16,410 --> 02:24:20,574
<i>But while I have Wen-ching
and Ah-chien...</i>

1080
02:24:20,748 --> 02:24:23,512
<i>...I think I'll be happy.</i>

1081
02:28:02,636 --> 02:28:04,433
Don't run!

1082
02:28:08,876 --> 02:28:10,865
Still running! Shit!

1083
02:28:14,682 --> 02:28:15,808
Why are you shouting?

1084
02:28:30,898 --> 02:28:31,990
On your knees.

1085
02:28:35,336 --> 02:28:36,667
Heads down.

1086
02:28:43,777 --> 02:28:44,971
What are you looking at?

1087
02:31:47,194 --> 02:31:50,823
<i>Ah-shue, your uncle Wen-ching
has been arrested.</i>

1088
02:31:51,198 --> 02:31:54,759
<i>We still don't know where he is.</i>

1089
02:31:55,803 --> 02:31:57,794
<i>At first we considered running away,</i>

1090
02:31:58,138 --> 02:32:00,868
<i>...but there was nowhere to go</i>

1091
02:32:04,111 --> 02:32:06,204
<i>I am writing this long after,</i>

1092
02:32:06,413 --> 02:32:09,849
<i>...because only now do I feel
calmer.</i>

1093
02:32:11,185 --> 02:32:15,349
<i>This photo was taken three days
before Wen-ching's arrest.</i>

1094
02:32:16,523 --> 02:32:17,956
<i>When they came for him,</i>

1095
02:32:18,158 --> 02:32:20,490
<i>...he was taking someone's portrait.</i>

1096
02:32:20,994 --> 02:32:23,189
<i>He insisted on finishing the job...</i>

1097
02:32:23,597 --> 02:32:25,758
<i>...before they took him away.</i>

1098
02:32:29,069 --> 02:32:33,768
<i>I searched and asked all over
Taipei but have no news.</i>

1099
02:32:35,309 --> 02:32:37,277
<i>Ah-chien has his first teeth.</i>

1100
02:32:37,744 --> 02:32:39,405
<i>He has a lovely smile...</i>

1101
02:32:39,513 --> 02:32:41,413
<i>and your uncle's eyes.</i>

1102
02:32:42,516 --> 02:32:44,507
<i>Please, come and see us soon.</i>

1103
02:32:45,519 --> 02:32:47,282
<i>It's fresh in Chiu-fen.</i>

1104
02:32:47,754 --> 02:32:49,381
<i>The autumn flowers
are in bloom.</i>

1105
02:32:49,756 --> 02:32:52,623
<i>The mountains are all white,
like snow.</i>

1106
02:32:59,132 --> 02:33:00,156
It's time to eat.

1107
02:33:00,267 --> 02:33:01,996
OK. Just a moment.

1108
02:33:02,450 --> 02:33:03,500
Ah-chi,

1109
02:33:04,004 --> 02:33:05,437
...you shouldn't be watching
adults gambling.

1110
02:33:05,639 --> 02:33:06,833
Bring your uncle.

1111
02:33:07,474 --> 02:33:09,066
Uncle, it's time to eat.

1112
02:33:20,387 --> 02:33:21,411
Where is Uncle Wan?

1113
02:33:21,522 --> 02:33:23,422
He said he'd be back soon.

1114
02:33:23,524 --> 02:33:24,616
Wash your hands.

1115
02:33:58,717 --> 02:33:59,717
Help yourselves.

1116
02:35:42,618 --> 02:35:48,318
December 1949.
Mainland China is lost.

1117
02:35:48,319 --> 02:35:53,319
The Nationalist government
moves to Taiwan.

1118
02:35:53,320 --> 02:35:59,320
Taipei becomes
provisional capital.
