1
00:00:55,349 --> 00:00:55,974
Brother Nam, I want to join you

2
00:00:56,384 --> 00:00:58,443
Pau-pan, you absent from school again?

3
00:00:58,919 --> 00:01:00,887
We have an English test today

4
00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:02,979
I don't know English. Better stay away

5
00:01:03,657 --> 00:01:04,589
How about Chow-pan?

6
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:05,687
My brother?

7
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,052
I think he is courting a girl now

8
00:01:14,802 --> 00:01:15,734
Want some ice-cream?

9
00:01:24,311 --> 00:01:26,643
Kiddy, come here!

10
00:01:33,521 --> 00:01:34,988
You know this is my court?
How dare you play here?

11
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:36,515
I only know

12
00:01:36,657 --> 00:01:38,022
it's under
the supervision of the Urban Council

13
00:01:38,325 --> 00:01:38,916
What are you?

14
00:01:39,527 --> 00:01:40,459
I live in block 13

15
00:01:40,661 --> 00:01:41,457
That means you are not covered
by any triads

16
00:01:42,063 --> 00:01:43,758
My name is Kwan

17
00:01:44,098 --> 00:01:45,998
Tomorrow, pay me a red pocket

18
00:01:47,368 --> 00:01:48,198
You think you can make it?

19
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,998
Are you despising me?

20
00:01:59,447 --> 00:02:02,416
I tell you, give me a red pocket,

21
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,317
otherwise, each of you will get a bottle

22
00:02:04,585 --> 00:02:05,916
And I'll hit you
whenever I see you again!

23
00:02:12,426 --> 00:02:14,894
Stop...

24
00:02:16,931 --> 00:02:17,898
Fatty, you wanna leave?

25
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:18,895
Come on!

26
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,933
Stop! Stop!

27
00:02:22,369 --> 00:02:25,668
Stop!

28
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,804
Hit with all your might!

29
00:02:30,678 --> 00:02:32,976
Kwan, you don't have to go so far!

30
00:02:33,247 --> 00:02:34,441
They are just kids!

31
00:02:35,516 --> 00:02:39,350
Brother Bee,
I just want to teach them how to behave

32
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,282
Hit harder

33
00:02:40,855 --> 00:02:43,153
They are just kids, let them go!

34
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:46,123
Alright, you have my respect

35
00:02:47,628 --> 00:02:49,061
Stop it

36
00:02:51,732 --> 00:02:52,391
Brother Bee,

37
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,034
I received an order to do something,

38
00:02:55,302 --> 00:02:56,234
so I want you to lend me some boys

39
00:02:57,238 --> 00:02:58,330
Let's talk about it at the shop tonight

40
00:02:58,939 --> 00:02:59,598
Great!

41
00:03:10,317 --> 00:03:11,079
How is it, kiddy?

42
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,588
Are you alright?

43
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:19,719
If you want to be good,
go home and study,

44
00:03:19,994 --> 00:03:20,858
never come here again

45
00:03:21,595 --> 00:03:24,086
If you come here to play football,
tell them that you know Bee

46
00:03:48,589 --> 00:03:49,521
Kelly...

47
00:03:50,257 --> 00:03:51,087
Do you want some milk?

48
00:03:52,126 --> 00:03:52,785
No, thanks

49
00:03:53,027 --> 00:03:54,927
Why not? It's Ho Nam's treat

50
00:03:55,496 --> 00:03:57,020
He should come himself,

51
00:03:57,198 --> 00:03:58,426
you won't help a bit!

52
00:03:58,566 --> 00:03:59,123
Really?

53
00:03:59,266 --> 00:04:00,733
And, please tell him,

54
00:04:00,868 --> 00:04:03,166
don't pass me notes during class again

55
00:04:03,404 --> 00:04:04,336
Passing notes?

56
00:04:04,972 --> 00:04:06,234
Did you pass her notes?

57
00:04:07,107 --> 00:04:08,039
It's shit

58
00:04:11,745 --> 00:04:12,507
So corny!

59
00:04:12,646 --> 00:04:14,546
I couldn't finish watching

60
00:04:14,682 --> 00:04:16,479
"As Years Go By" last night

61
00:04:16,984 --> 00:04:18,076
Woo, Andy Lau is so cool!

62
00:04:18,352 --> 00:04:19,284
I think so too

63
00:04:20,854 --> 00:04:23,186
You bring bad luck!

64
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:24,081
I think Maggie Cheung is good

65
00:04:24,258 --> 00:04:24,724
Let's go home and finish the movie

66
00:04:24,858 --> 00:04:25,552
Let's go now

67
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,058
Let's go

68
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:28,991
They are after us

69
00:04:29,463 --> 00:04:30,555
Let's move, hurry up

70
00:04:30,698 --> 00:04:33,895
Kelly, may I give you a ride?

71
00:04:34,034 --> 00:04:35,296
So you won't have to wait for a bus

72
00:04:35,636 --> 00:04:37,069
No, thanks

73
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,472
Don't panic, I am a nice guy

74
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,202
I just want to make friends with you

75
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:45,069
What's the matter?

76
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,940
None of your business, get lost

77
00:04:47,648 --> 00:04:50,378
What are you looking at?
Kid, just take care of your milk

78
00:04:52,853 --> 00:04:53,877
Kelly is our class prefect,
pay some respects

79
00:04:54,154 --> 00:04:55,485
She is a girl too, are you insane?

80
00:04:55,623 --> 00:04:56,487
What are you staying here for?

81
00:04:57,258 --> 00:04:57,815
What's the matter?

82
00:04:58,325 --> 00:05:00,293
Nothing! We are leaving now,
bye bye, Mr. Hung

83
00:05:01,462 --> 00:05:02,588
Go home boys!

84
00:05:03,163 --> 00:05:03,788
What's the matter?

85
00:05:04,031 --> 00:05:04,725
Nothing

86
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:07,861
Trying to be cool?

87
00:05:09,036 --> 00:05:09,798
As a student,

88
00:05:10,004 --> 00:05:11,631
please just study and don't make trouble

89
00:05:11,872 --> 00:05:12,668
Got you, Mr. Hung

90
00:05:13,073 --> 00:05:13,869
Bye bye, sir

91
00:05:14,074 --> 00:05:14,597
Bye bye, sir

92
00:05:17,177 --> 00:05:18,337
Watch out!

93
00:05:27,621 --> 00:05:28,519
Woo! Beat Piggy to death!

94
00:05:29,156 --> 00:05:30,418
You are dead, Piggy!

95
00:05:30,858 --> 00:05:31,517
Piggy!

96
00:05:31,792 --> 00:05:32,781
You'd better eat shit! You Piggy!

97
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:44,832
Where is Chicken?

98
00:05:45,406 --> 00:05:46,600
His stuff is here, but where is Chicken?

99
00:05:47,107 --> 00:05:48,631
I don't know

100
00:06:19,273 --> 00:06:20,331
Is Nam insane?

101
00:06:20,974 --> 00:06:23,340
If you can't get your girl,
you'll act like that

102
00:06:23,744 --> 00:06:26,076
I haven't experienced that,
how do I know?

103
00:06:26,847 --> 00:06:28,678
Go home for your masturbation!

104
00:06:29,216 --> 00:06:31,741
Please, my nuts are waiting for you!

105
00:06:32,252 --> 00:06:34,550
Come on! They are waiting, aren't they?

106
00:07:03,484 --> 00:07:05,111
Don't come over! Don't!

107
00:07:05,953 --> 00:07:06,681
What are you doing?

108
00:07:08,155 --> 00:07:09,884
I didn't want to waste time,
so I did something first

109
00:07:10,023 --> 00:07:10,921
What are you doing?

110
00:07:11,358 --> 00:07:12,290
This is Chocolate

111
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,995
We are practising "Flute Stance"

112
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:16,892
Flute Stance?

113
00:07:17,131 --> 00:07:19,156
Damn you Chicken! Screwing again!

114
00:07:20,067 --> 00:07:22,399
This is Western music

115
00:07:22,736 --> 00:07:23,634
You know it?

116
00:07:23,771 --> 00:07:24,601
You bastard!

117
00:07:25,472 --> 00:07:26,268
Watch me!

118
00:07:29,943 --> 00:07:31,433
Let's practise
for tomorrow's singing contest

119
00:08:13,921 --> 00:08:16,651
Yummi, Ho Nam composed...

120
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,052
a song for you

121
00:08:18,258 --> 00:08:19,919
I don't know that

122
00:08:20,093 --> 00:08:20,855
Come on!

123
00:08:20,994 --> 00:08:23,485
Everyone knows Ho Nam is falling for you

124
00:08:23,997 --> 00:08:25,055
Jesus! Better ask him to stop dreaming

125
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,894
She is rich and decent,

126
00:08:27,034 --> 00:08:27,796
who does he think he is?

127
00:09:50,617 --> 00:09:52,608
Not bad, you are gifted!

128
00:10:19,813 --> 00:10:21,110
Stop! Stop singing

129
00:10:25,352 --> 00:10:25,909
Why are you stopping us?

130
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,020
What are you singing?

131
00:10:29,423 --> 00:10:31,653
Principal, this is music

132
00:10:31,792 --> 00:10:32,816
You know creativity?

133
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,257
What is it?

134
00:10:34,595 --> 00:10:35,425
I just heard you screaming

135
00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:37,153
And I know what the lyrics mean

136
00:10:37,464 --> 00:10:39,864
You are scolding
the teachers and the school!

137
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:41,962
Go back stage now,
and see me in my office later

138
00:10:42,436 --> 00:10:43,164
What did we do wrong?

139
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:44,794
This is a singing contest

140
00:10:45,038 --> 00:10:47,131
You haven't stipulated
what we should and should not sing

141
00:10:47,674 --> 00:10:48,333
Why can't you accept rock music?

142
00:10:48,909 --> 00:10:51,207
I am the principal, not you

143
00:10:51,478 --> 00:10:52,740
I said no, that's it!

144
00:10:52,946 --> 00:10:53,708
What do you say?

145
00:11:00,754 --> 00:11:01,778
See?

146
00:11:01,922 --> 00:11:03,890
They are supporting us

147
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,449
You! Come down right now!

148
00:11:06,593 --> 00:11:07,287
What's the matter?

149
00:11:07,995 --> 00:11:09,223
You were dismissed from our school,
weren't you?

150
00:11:09,563 --> 00:11:09,927
Why do you come back?

151
00:11:10,063 --> 00:11:12,190
I come back for the band! What?

152
00:11:12,332 --> 00:11:14,129
This is not the right school for you!
Let's go

153
00:11:14,635 --> 00:11:16,535
We don't welcome bad students like you!

154
00:11:17,437 --> 00:11:19,200
Sorry, sir, I promise,
it won't happen again

155
00:11:19,539 --> 00:11:21,973
If you don't like it,
we will not sing that song again

156
00:11:22,109 --> 00:11:23,098
But just give us a chance

157
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:24,706
I'll consider it

158
00:11:30,117 --> 00:11:30,981
Go!

159
00:11:58,278 --> 00:12:01,247
Why don't you study hard?

160
00:12:01,615 --> 00:12:04,413
I always support an oratorical contest
instead of a singing contest

161
00:12:06,219 --> 00:12:08,244
It's happy to leave school

162
00:12:08,955 --> 00:12:11,219
Our dad won't let us go!

163
00:12:15,328 --> 00:12:16,226
Take it back

164
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:20,531
He will teach us a good lesson tonight

165
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:21,292
Go!

166
00:12:34,014 --> 00:12:35,538
Get lost

167
00:12:56,203 --> 00:12:57,898
Don't move...

168
00:13:05,746 --> 00:13:06,838
Sir, we are the victims

169
00:13:07,047 --> 00:13:07,706
Squat!

170
00:13:09,182 --> 00:13:09,614
Come on! Squat!

171
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,147
We are victims! Sir!

172
00:13:12,285 --> 00:13:13,047
Squat!

173
00:13:17,224 --> 00:13:17,952
Squat!

174
00:13:18,825 --> 00:13:20,520
Move faster!

175
00:13:21,561 --> 00:13:22,459
Lower your head and walk

176
00:13:25,232 --> 00:13:26,631
You bastards are all under arrest

177
00:13:27,334 --> 00:13:29,268
Why don't you play music
instead of fighting?

178
00:13:32,239 --> 00:13:32,830
Don't move

179
00:13:34,274 --> 00:13:36,139
Brother, will we have a criminal record?

180
00:13:37,077 --> 00:13:39,204
You will receive a ten year sentence

181
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:40,646
Are you bluffing?

182
00:13:41,081 --> 00:13:42,946
Shut up! First your finger prints
and then your statement

183
00:13:48,421 --> 00:13:49,183
Who is your boss?

184
00:13:50,724 --> 00:13:51,622
I am not a triad member

185
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,752
Not a member? So why did you fight?

186
00:13:55,095 --> 00:13:56,084
I am not a triad member,

187
00:13:56,229 --> 00:13:57,423
I am a student, sir

188
00:13:57,931 --> 00:13:58,898
I caught many triad members...

189
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,860
who claimed themselves students before

190
00:14:01,368 --> 00:14:02,733
You are a triad student, aren't you?

191
00:14:06,106 --> 00:14:07,130
I was beaten,
but I am not a triad member,

192
00:14:07,274 --> 00:14:07,865
sir!

193
00:14:08,141 --> 00:14:09,165
You think I am a fool?

194
00:14:09,743 --> 00:14:11,438
Tell me where you live

195
00:14:12,245 --> 00:14:13,075
Block 13, Nam Tin

196
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,276
Louder please

197
00:14:14,481 --> 00:14:15,675
Block 13, Nam Tin

198
00:14:23,824 --> 00:14:25,485
Let me advise you kid,

199
00:14:26,326 --> 00:14:28,658
we have rights to detain you 48 hours

200
00:14:29,262 --> 00:14:32,288
If no one pays your bail,
you'll enjoy the holidays here

201
00:14:33,266 --> 00:14:36,463
You're Chan Ho Nam,
I know you pretty well

202
00:14:37,838 --> 00:14:38,497
Are you threatening me?

203
00:14:39,706 --> 00:14:42,504
You ignorant kids!

204
00:14:43,076 --> 00:14:43,701
I tell you,

205
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,907
don't let me see you again,

206
00:14:46,046 --> 00:14:47,741
otherwise I will teach you a good lesson

207
00:14:48,548 --> 00:14:50,243
You won't be that lucky next time
to be saved by cops

208
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,175
Got me? Bastard!

209
00:14:54,454 --> 00:14:55,148
Let's fight one to one!

210
00:14:55,322 --> 00:14:56,050
You stupid!

211
00:14:56,189 --> 00:14:56,883
What's the matter?

212
00:14:58,658 --> 00:15:00,023
I always said you are a fool

213
00:15:00,393 --> 00:15:02,361
I love a gang fight, many to one,
you know?

214
00:15:02,495 --> 00:15:03,052
Move!

215
00:15:03,196 --> 00:15:03,594
Bastard!

216
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:04,754
Help!

217
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,629
What's the matter with you?
It's not a carnival!

218
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:10,099
This is a police station!

219
00:15:10,737 --> 00:15:11,362
No, sir...

220
00:15:11,504 --> 00:15:12,971
we would like to play a game,

221
00:15:13,406 --> 00:15:14,304
but now... it's stopped

222
00:15:14,674 --> 00:15:15,834
No more fun!

223
00:15:16,009 --> 00:15:16,338
Chu Wai-chau

224
00:15:16,476 --> 00:15:16,908
Yes!

225
00:15:17,043 --> 00:15:17,907
Someone has come to pay your bail

226
00:15:18,144 --> 00:15:18,906
Thank you, sir

227
00:15:19,946 --> 00:15:21,277
My boss has come to pay my bail,

228
00:15:21,615 --> 00:15:23,242
take your time!

229
00:15:24,484 --> 00:15:25,178
Sir, I am coming

230
00:15:25,886 --> 00:15:27,046
Chan Sai-kit Yes

231
00:15:27,254 --> 00:15:28,482
Hung Fai Yes

232
00:15:28,755 --> 00:15:29,483
Cheung Kwok-ming Yes

233
00:15:29,623 --> 00:15:31,386
Wong Chi-kit Yes

234
00:15:32,058 --> 00:15:32,786
Come out if you hear your name

235
00:15:35,428 --> 00:15:36,122
Thank you sir

236
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:37,824
Do you want to play tricks?

237
00:15:55,348 --> 00:15:57,441
Bee, why are you here?
Did you commit any crime?

238
00:15:58,084 --> 00:15:59,813
Coming to a police station doesn't mean
I've committed anything

239
00:15:59,953 --> 00:16:01,648
You come here everyday,
it doesn't mean you committed any crime

240
00:16:01,922 --> 00:16:03,480
I dare not despise you triad members

241
00:16:03,857 --> 00:16:04,949
You guys are eloquent sometimes

242
00:16:05,358 --> 00:16:07,155
I just come to pay the bail
for some kids

243
00:16:08,194 --> 00:16:09,684
Just being good for once

244
00:16:10,063 --> 00:16:11,428
What's the matter, Officer Ox?

245
00:16:12,265 --> 00:16:13,857
Officer Chan,
I come to pay the bail for some kids

246
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:14,757
What are their names?

247
00:16:15,001 --> 00:16:17,265
Chan Ho Nam,
Pao Tak-ming and Pao Tat-yee

248
00:16:17,871 --> 00:16:18,565
Thank you sir

249
00:16:19,272 --> 00:16:21,297
You should teach them a lesson

250
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:24,105
Being their boss, this is my job

251
00:16:24,244 --> 00:16:25,575
Do you want to teach them for me?

252
00:16:26,479 --> 00:16:28,310
Bee, you are so friendly with the cops

253
00:16:28,448 --> 00:16:29,540
You want to seek
better co-operation with them?

254
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,050
Same as you,
I come to pay the bail for the kids

255
00:16:32,385 --> 00:16:34,319
I've finished!
I am just waiting for them

256
00:16:39,025 --> 00:16:39,389
Boss

257
00:16:39,526 --> 00:16:40,356
Hi, Piggy

258
00:16:42,896 --> 00:16:43,487
Is everyone here?

259
00:16:43,997 --> 00:16:44,622
Kwan,

260
00:16:44,831 --> 00:16:46,355
your kids were no match for mine

261
00:16:46,499 --> 00:16:47,557
They made you lose face

262
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,464
Piggy, is that the truth?

263
00:16:51,671 --> 00:16:52,501
Of course not!

264
00:16:52,772 --> 00:16:55,036
We were just warming up
when the cops arrived

265
00:16:55,575 --> 00:16:57,236
You bastard! I can tell you are lying

266
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,043
You made me lose face

267
00:16:59,479 --> 00:17:00,776
Well, listen to me!

268
00:17:01,614 --> 00:17:03,241
Black Girl paid $500...

269
00:17:03,616 --> 00:17:04,913
for you each in advance

270
00:17:05,285 --> 00:17:06,843
No matter how,

271
00:17:06,987 --> 00:17:08,352
you should pay me back the money

272
00:17:08,922 --> 00:17:09,616
Finished

273
00:17:10,056 --> 00:17:10,488
Got me?

274
00:17:11,224 --> 00:17:13,192
Kwan, being a boss, can't you afford
to pay the bail for them?

275
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,126
Well, I can afford that

276
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:18,090
Bee, you are rich and righteous!

277
00:17:18,231 --> 00:17:19,562
See, this is a sample for you all

278
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:20,998
Thank you...

279
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,312
You told me you are not a triad member?

280
00:17:34,914 --> 00:17:35,846
Your boss comes to bail you now

281
00:17:56,703 --> 00:17:58,136
Isn't this Bee's turf?

282
00:17:58,338 --> 00:17:59,999
No, this is Bee's boxing school

283
00:18:00,473 --> 00:18:01,405
But no one is practising

284
00:18:01,808 --> 00:18:03,503
What time is it? It's two o'clock

285
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:10,007
Boss

286
00:18:11,051 --> 00:18:11,881
This is Big Head

287
00:18:12,218 --> 00:18:13,742
Senior of Chicken, introduce yourself

288
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,611
Hi, Big Head

289
00:18:15,155 --> 00:18:15,678
Pau-pan

290
00:18:15,922 --> 00:18:16,547
Chow-pan

291
00:18:21,928 --> 00:18:24,021
Boss,
aren't you recruiting us as your boys?

292
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:27,164
I paid the bail for Chicken's sake

293
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:28,959
Look at you! You are students!

294
00:18:30,003 --> 00:18:32,767
You want to follow me?
Let me consider first

295
00:18:33,106 --> 00:18:34,903
I guess, you won't remember me
when you wake up tomorrow

296
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:39,037
We are not triad members,

297
00:18:40,847 --> 00:18:42,508
but the cops think we are

298
00:18:42,682 --> 00:18:44,479
Your look is better than mine

299
00:18:44,818 --> 00:18:47,548
When I walk in Tsimshatsui East, usually
I'll be questioned by cops for 4 times

300
00:18:47,687 --> 00:18:48,483
Four times?

301
00:18:49,222 --> 00:18:51,417
You look corny indeed!

302
00:18:52,892 --> 00:18:54,382
I can't...

303
00:18:54,527 --> 00:18:55,516
get rid of the ink mark!

304
00:18:56,696 --> 00:18:59,426
If you want to get rid of it,
you can, just try

305
00:19:01,201 --> 00:19:02,168
The toilet is over there!

306
00:19:02,302 --> 00:19:03,564
Wash your hands and come out for noodles

307
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:06,498
You know where?

308
00:19:09,676 --> 00:19:10,506
It's hard to remove it! Why?

309
00:19:12,479 --> 00:19:13,639
Bastard!

310
00:19:15,682 --> 00:19:16,512
You moron!

311
00:19:18,985 --> 00:19:20,452
It's hard to remove it

312
00:19:23,423 --> 00:19:25,891
I quit! You take your time

313
00:20:11,304 --> 00:20:12,396
Ho Nam, come out for noodles!

314
00:20:14,941 --> 00:20:16,033
Which one do you want?

315
00:20:16,276 --> 00:20:16,970
Anything will do

316
00:20:20,547 --> 00:20:22,105
I saw a beautiful girl inside the toilet

317
00:20:22,482 --> 00:20:23,574
Where?

318
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,215
Are you kidding?
I didn't see and smell any beauty around

319
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:28,043
Is that Fei, the girlfriend of Big Head?

320
00:20:28,688 --> 00:20:29,450
Boss

321
00:20:30,223 --> 00:20:32,487
Girl, are you picking up your boyfriend?

322
00:20:32,926 --> 00:20:33,790
Yes

323
00:20:36,696 --> 00:20:40,097
Sister-in-law, you look pretty today!

324
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,698
Let's shake our hands

325
00:20:52,912 --> 00:20:53,879
Boss, I am leaving

326
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,414
Is that the girl?

327
00:20:59,219 --> 00:21:00,379
I saw her crying in the toilet

328
00:21:01,054 --> 00:21:03,249
It's ridiculous, she is always very cool

329
00:21:03,389 --> 00:21:04,686
No one sees her cry

330
00:21:04,824 --> 00:21:05,620
How do you know that?

331
00:21:05,959 --> 00:21:07,517
Everyone here knows that

332
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,591
Yeah!
Will you introduce her friends to me?

333
00:21:09,729 --> 00:21:11,924
I want to have such a cool girl
as a girlfriend

334
00:21:12,198 --> 00:21:13,790
Just eat your noodles and shut up

335
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:14,666
Yes!

336
00:21:16,502 --> 00:21:18,800
Eat the beans! And shut up!

337
00:21:23,209 --> 00:21:25,404
Were you crying?

338
00:21:25,712 --> 00:21:26,508
No

339
00:21:27,981 --> 00:21:29,039
Who did you just call?

340
00:21:31,851 --> 00:21:33,478
Would you leave me alone?

341
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,683
Do you consider me your boyfriend?

342
00:21:37,557 --> 00:21:39,650
My ex-boyfriend died,

343
00:21:40,927 --> 00:21:41,859
OK?

344
00:21:45,198 --> 00:21:49,066
It's not true. Anyway, just don't ask

345
00:21:56,542 --> 00:21:57,907
You kid! Stay where you are!

346
00:21:58,177 --> 00:21:59,872
What do you want? Don't move

347
00:22:00,446 --> 00:22:01,743
Are you a triad member?
Why do you come to the first block?

348
00:22:02,715 --> 00:22:04,376
I... I live in block 13

349
00:22:04,517 --> 00:22:05,814
13? That means you are not a member

350
00:22:06,052 --> 00:22:06,814
I am a Hung Hing boy

351
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,085
I want to rob you!
Take everything out, hurry up!

352
00:22:16,462 --> 00:22:17,588
Money is OK, don't rape me

353
00:22:19,265 --> 00:22:20,493
Piss off!

354
00:22:22,335 --> 00:22:24,132
You bastard! How dare you fool me!

355
00:22:24,404 --> 00:22:25,701
Looking for trouble?

356
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:28,238
It hurts! No!

357
00:22:28,808 --> 00:22:29,399
Do you want me to kill you?

358
00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:32,107
Just for fun! Why are you so mean?

359
00:22:32,378 --> 00:22:33,140
Serve you right!

360
00:22:34,147 --> 00:22:35,546
The guy was so afraid!

361
00:22:35,715 --> 00:22:37,012
He gave me everything

362
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:39,584
His wallet, his phone,

363
00:22:39,852 --> 00:22:41,183
his watch, everything!

364
00:22:42,388 --> 00:22:43,821
You are really tough!

365
00:22:44,524 --> 00:22:45,286
You take yourself...

366
00:22:45,425 --> 00:22:46,949
as a real rascal?

367
00:22:47,327 --> 00:22:48,157
When did you follow Bee?

368
00:22:50,463 --> 00:22:51,395
Last Christmas

369
00:22:52,832 --> 00:22:55,767
I went to a party...

370
00:22:56,803 --> 00:22:58,202
someone assaulted me

371
00:22:59,205 --> 00:23:00,467
And coincidentally, I met Bee

372
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,564
He saved me... thus I followed him

373
00:23:03,676 --> 00:23:04,768
Didn't he ask you
to recruit any fellows for him?

374
00:23:06,045 --> 00:23:08,605
Even if someone wants to follow him,
he may not like it!

375
00:23:08,881 --> 00:23:10,246
You know,

376
00:23:10,383 --> 00:23:12,010
it involves two parties

377
00:23:12,251 --> 00:23:13,548
It's not like wooing girls,
just flatter and screw

378
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,588
Nam, we have quit school now, why not...

379
00:23:17,657 --> 00:23:18,817
Pau-pan

380
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,184
I...

381
00:23:22,829 --> 00:23:24,194
I'll follow you!

382
00:23:25,298 --> 00:23:26,128
Where's your brain?

383
00:23:26,265 --> 00:23:26,993
Stop that!

384
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,962
Let me enjoy it first

385
00:23:29,602 --> 00:23:31,263
Chicken, what the hell is it?

386
00:23:31,571 --> 00:23:32,560
How dare you!

387
00:23:33,206 --> 00:23:34,298
I am Chicken, come out!

388
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:40,001
Nam, our block and block 16...

389
00:23:40,146 --> 00:23:42,842
are not under any triad's supervision

390
00:23:43,383 --> 00:23:44,873
If we follow Bee,

391
00:23:45,084 --> 00:23:46,745
then the whole block 13 will be under us

392
00:23:46,886 --> 00:23:48,376
You think becoming a triad member
means getting rich?

393
00:23:48,521 --> 00:23:49,510
You don't have to work to make a living?

394
00:23:50,223 --> 00:23:50,985
We can court
as many girls as we like too

395
00:23:51,391 --> 00:23:52,858
You can find a whore too!

396
00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:55,425
Do you want me to kill you?

397
00:23:55,628 --> 00:23:56,356
I am sorry...

398
00:23:56,496 --> 00:23:59,124
Big Head's girlfriend
we saw in the boxing school is great,

399
00:23:59,465 --> 00:24:00,432
isn't she?

400
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,499
Damn it! She is not your girl!

401
00:24:02,769 --> 00:24:03,929
So what?

402
00:24:04,637 --> 00:24:05,797
Think of it! She is really nice

403
00:24:06,406 --> 00:24:07,338
Really?

404
00:24:12,712 --> 00:24:13,474
Yes...

405
00:24:14,313 --> 00:24:16,281
This is Chan Ho Nam, hello

406
00:24:17,617 --> 00:24:18,413
What's the matter?

407
00:24:19,252 --> 00:24:21,777
Well, I just want to know
who won the singing contest

408
00:24:23,156 --> 00:24:25,147
"New Kid in Town" won the contest

409
00:24:25,925 --> 00:24:27,449
That's another rock band!

410
00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:32,327
Who are you?

411
00:24:32,632 --> 00:24:34,429
This is Chan Ho Nam, auntie

412
00:24:34,767 --> 00:24:36,428
I see, you are the bad boy
who was kicked out of school!

413
00:24:36,569 --> 00:24:37,536
Mom... Shut up...

414
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:38,659
I tell you,

415
00:24:38,838 --> 00:24:40,203
don't you ever call again

416
00:24:40,373 --> 00:24:41,135
Otherwise I'll call the police

417
00:24:42,675 --> 00:24:43,403
Mom...

418
00:24:43,576 --> 00:24:46,204
Kelly, be a good girl

419
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:01,789
I am Chicken of the Hung Hing Group,
come out!

420
00:25:05,097 --> 00:25:05,654
Damn it!

421
00:25:05,798 --> 00:25:07,390
You'd better shut your damn mouth!
Bastard!

422
00:25:07,834 --> 00:25:08,926
She is great!

423
00:25:10,703 --> 00:25:11,567
Wonderful!

424
00:25:19,812 --> 00:25:21,370
Damn it!
Haven't you seen a beauty before?

425
00:25:21,514 --> 00:25:22,708
Damn it! Bastard

426
00:25:22,849 --> 00:25:24,339
Are you human? Is your mom a bitch?

427
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:25,173
Don't come over

428
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,111
Grandma!

429
00:25:28,454 --> 00:25:29,614
Damn you Chicken!

430
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,686
You want to bump me to death?

431
00:25:30,823 --> 00:25:32,347
I saw a ghost...

432
00:25:32,492 --> 00:25:33,322
Ghost?

433
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:35,388
Yes,
the ghost has just passed through...

434
00:25:35,962 --> 00:25:36,758
So ugly!

435
00:25:37,663 --> 00:25:38,254
Where is Ho Nam?

436
00:25:38,498 --> 00:25:40,227
I don't know, do you trust me?

437
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,294
I'll get it for you Not exactly!

438
00:25:42,435 --> 00:25:43,265
Let me help you!

439
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:45,261
This guy is so ugly looking! Look!

440
00:25:46,472 --> 00:25:47,530
How ugly he looks!

441
00:25:48,307 --> 00:25:49,239
Just take the money!

442
00:25:49,675 --> 00:25:50,039
Why?

443
00:25:50,176 --> 00:25:51,370
Throw the wallet into the mail box

444
00:25:52,311 --> 00:25:53,938
Why not throw it into the rubbish bin?

445
00:25:54,547 --> 00:25:56,139
Throw into the mail box,
so he can get it back

446
00:25:56,582 --> 00:25:57,446
Next time if you lose your way home,

447
00:25:57,783 --> 00:25:59,751
jump into the mail box, OK?

448
00:25:59,952 --> 00:26:00,976
It's too small for me

449
00:26:04,323 --> 00:26:05,153
Ho Nam!

450
00:26:05,591 --> 00:26:06,182
Grandma

451
00:26:06,826 --> 00:26:07,485
Grandma

452
00:26:07,793 --> 00:26:09,556
Why didn't you go home after school?

453
00:26:09,996 --> 00:26:11,623
I'll be right back!
I'm having a little chat

454
00:26:12,031 --> 00:26:12,725
Go home!

455
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,392
I don't mind you smoking

456
00:26:18,237 --> 00:26:20,262
You can smoke at home

457
00:26:21,007 --> 00:26:23,601
Your mom called many times for you

458
00:26:23,743 --> 00:26:25,210
Remember to give her a call

459
00:26:25,945 --> 00:26:26,707
OK

460
00:26:38,925 --> 00:26:41,291
I've deposited money into your account

461
00:26:41,561 --> 00:26:43,324
If you want to buy the microwave oven,
you buy it

462
00:26:43,763 --> 00:26:46,231
Great!
Last time I picked up Dee from school,

463
00:26:46,465 --> 00:26:48,023
I saw that it was on sale

464
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:58,342
Brother

465
00:27:00,212 --> 00:27:01,941
Good boy! Is it a holiday?

466
00:27:02,114 --> 00:27:02,671
Yes

467
00:27:03,182 --> 00:27:03,910
Have you been a good boy?

468
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:05,108
Yes, I have

469
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,387
It's late,
why haven't Sis and Dee come home yet?

470
00:27:11,157 --> 00:27:12,021
They must be on the way

471
00:27:12,358 --> 00:27:13,120
I am going to work now

472
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,317
It's OK, I'll do it myself

473
00:27:26,572 --> 00:27:28,164
Dee, who were you playing with?

474
00:27:28,307 --> 00:27:29,968
Brother Ho Nam

475
00:27:33,546 --> 00:27:34,706
Sis, come back home

476
00:27:38,918 --> 00:27:39,976
Ho Nam, I'm glad to see you

477
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:40,842
Mom!

478
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,018
Come and eat!

479
00:27:42,188 --> 00:27:43,883
Ho Nam, walk me downstairs, would you?

480
00:27:44,056 --> 00:27:44,750
I have something to talk to you

481
00:27:46,225 --> 00:27:46,816
Hung...

482
00:27:47,026 --> 00:27:48,391
It's alright,
we are going to have a chat

483
00:27:56,802 --> 00:27:57,894
I know you dislike me

484
00:27:59,105 --> 00:28:00,265
I know you dislike me too

485
00:28:00,506 --> 00:28:01,700
Wrong! I married your mom and

486
00:28:01,841 --> 00:28:03,331
I don't mind having a step son

487
00:28:04,877 --> 00:28:08,074
I work on an ambulance,
I always see people dying

488
00:28:09,281 --> 00:28:12,444
You are old enough! It doesn't matter
if you don't live with mom,

489
00:28:13,419 --> 00:28:14,545
I don't mind you not respecting me

490
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,946
But I am always your step father

491
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:18,554
Mom said

492
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:21,217
you were the one
who took my dad to the ambulance

493
00:28:22,094 --> 00:28:23,721
You dad was a triad member

494
00:28:23,863 --> 00:28:24,989
He was badly injured

495
00:28:25,831 --> 00:28:27,992
Your mom stayed next to him
on the ambulance and cried badly

496
00:28:29,101 --> 00:28:30,295
The next time I saw her,
she became a Ionely widow

497
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:32,160
Then I wooed her and we got married

498
00:28:33,906 --> 00:28:35,305
You took many triad members in your car,
didn't you?

499
00:28:36,776 --> 00:28:37,936
Go up and have some soup

500
00:28:38,644 --> 00:28:40,043
She loves you very much

501
00:28:40,212 --> 00:28:42,510
Going to school or not isn't important,
I just don't want you...

502
00:28:42,915 --> 00:28:44,678
to be half dead
when I see you on my ambulance

503
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:47,510
Go back

504
00:28:47,787 --> 00:28:49,687
Your mom's soup is the best in the world

505
00:28:54,794 --> 00:28:55,726
Drink more! Come on

506
00:28:56,796 --> 00:28:57,387
Thank you, mom

507
00:29:11,944 --> 00:29:14,378
Sis, go in and do homework
with your brother, go!

508
00:29:25,191 --> 00:29:27,557
Are you dismissed from school?

509
00:29:30,262 --> 00:29:33,026
The principal is insane!
He has no reason to do it

510
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:35,491
If you don't study, what can you do?

511
00:29:38,404 --> 00:29:40,201
Mom, I am already seventeen!

512
00:29:40,439 --> 00:29:41,804
You are just seventeen

513
00:29:48,214 --> 00:29:49,408
Well, I am leaving now

514
00:29:50,116 --> 00:29:50,946
Nam!

515
00:29:52,651 --> 00:29:54,778
It's not a good choice to be a rascal

516
00:29:55,054 --> 00:29:57,147
I don't want you
to follow your father's footsteps

517
00:29:59,892 --> 00:30:01,052
I know how to take care of myself

518
00:31:46,465 --> 00:31:48,228
This morning,
there were so many people in the temple

519
00:31:49,768 --> 00:31:50,757
Have you finished the soup yet?

520
00:31:56,976 --> 00:31:59,103
Grandma, I won't study in school anymore

521
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,140
I have found a job

522
00:32:03,782 --> 00:32:06,148
I'll work in a garage
They provide accommodation and food

523
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,012
So, I won't come back to sleep

524
00:32:10,289 --> 00:32:14,521
Good! I need not wake up
during the night to make you soup

525
00:32:15,194 --> 00:32:17,492
I can have a good sleep

526
00:32:25,304 --> 00:32:28,296
Grandma! Come on!

527
00:32:35,481 --> 00:32:38,382
Can you tell me how dad was killed?

528
00:32:42,021 --> 00:32:46,549
Those people are cruel and fierce

529
00:32:47,593 --> 00:32:49,083
The cop told me,

530
00:32:50,296 --> 00:32:53,231
he was slashed 47 times

531
00:32:55,167 --> 00:32:57,192
47 times

532
00:33:03,142 --> 00:33:04,734
Why did you let dad be a rascal?

533
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,574
Your dad was illiterate

534
00:33:12,618 --> 00:33:14,552
He didn't want to work as a worker...

535
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,444
for the rest of his life

536
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:21,226
He just wanted to make more money

537
00:33:22,895 --> 00:33:26,331
As his mom,
I couldn't stop him from doing this

538
00:33:37,176 --> 00:33:38,040
Don't worry, grandma

539
00:33:41,246 --> 00:33:42,235
I know how to take care of myself

540
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,264
Even if I choose the same road
which dad took,

541
00:34:06,572 --> 00:34:07,539
I will be different from him

542
00:34:13,712 --> 00:34:14,542
If you have time,

543
00:34:15,481 --> 00:34:17,449
go to Macau to see your dad's grave

544
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,778
This morning, I've got an oracle
from that temple for you

545
00:34:23,756 --> 00:34:27,453
It means luck!

546
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:34,360
And this is a safety charm, keep it

547
00:34:40,606 --> 00:34:41,470
Thank you, grandma

548
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:51,913
Don't worry, I am old enough

549
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,682
Remember to hold your temper

550
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:00,051
Don't argue
with your colleagues and friends

551
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:06,290
Take good care!

552
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,396
I am leaving, grandma

553
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,803
Brother Bee, I wish to follow you

554
00:36:16,068 --> 00:36:16,898
Sister-in-law

555
00:36:17,102 --> 00:36:18,069
Sit down...

556
00:36:18,203 --> 00:36:19,363
It's not a classroom,
why are you so polite?

557
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:23,337
Man, Keung, say hello to Brother Ho Nam

558
00:36:23,542 --> 00:36:24,509
Brother Ho Nam, how are you doing?

559
00:36:24,743 --> 00:36:26,074
Brother Chicken...

560
00:36:26,211 --> 00:36:27,906
This is Chow-pan, and this is Pau-pan!

561
00:36:28,347 --> 00:36:29,712
Your name is odd!

562
00:36:30,015 --> 00:36:33,883
How dare you tease me!
I would cut your dick off!

563
00:36:34,353 --> 00:36:35,217
Come on, cheers!

564
00:36:35,721 --> 00:36:36,517
Cheers!

565
00:36:37,422 --> 00:36:38,013
Big Head

566
00:36:38,624 --> 00:36:39,556
Bottoms up, you fatty!

567
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:41,526
Time are different now

568
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,524
In the past,

569
00:36:42,794 --> 00:36:44,455
a boss controls your life

570
00:36:44,997 --> 00:36:46,555
Although you have quit school,

571
00:36:46,865 --> 00:36:47,923
you'd update yourself

572
00:36:48,066 --> 00:36:48,896
You know?

573
00:36:49,334 --> 00:36:51,700
He knows English!

574
00:36:52,204 --> 00:36:53,967
Do you want us to study
in evening schools?

575
00:36:54,406 --> 00:36:55,930
You'll only waste your time
chasing girls there

576
00:36:59,444 --> 00:37:01,002
Learn driving, and boxing

577
00:37:01,547 --> 00:37:02,775
You may not win by your fists

578
00:37:03,482 --> 00:37:04,847
You'll need your brains as well

579
00:37:05,417 --> 00:37:07,385
Time to eat now! Just cut the crap

580
00:37:07,586 --> 00:37:09,486
This is your favourite

581
00:37:09,788 --> 00:37:10,413
It's great!

582
00:37:11,089 --> 00:37:12,852
And, learn how to respect women

583
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:14,052
Got it?

584
00:37:14,993 --> 00:37:15,925
Otherwise, you'll never have a chance
to eat chicken's ass

585
00:37:16,395 --> 00:37:17,259
And you'll have a chance to find a whore

586
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:18,996
Chicken, behave!

587
00:37:19,998 --> 00:37:20,987
I really respect you!

588
00:37:21,133 --> 00:37:22,065
Boss, let's drink!

589
00:37:22,601 --> 00:37:24,535
You love answering back!

590
00:37:26,471 --> 00:37:28,268
What the hell is it? Stop kicking me!

591
00:37:31,043 --> 00:37:31,737
Brother Bee

592
00:37:32,911 --> 00:37:35,106
Family gathering dinner?

593
00:37:35,547 --> 00:37:36,741
Everyone needs to eat

594
00:37:36,949 --> 00:37:38,177
Unless you are not a man!

595
00:37:39,184 --> 00:37:42,620
I heard that you've recruited these kids

596
00:37:42,921 --> 00:37:43,888
We are a family now,

597
00:37:44,022 --> 00:37:45,455
please look after them if necessary

598
00:37:46,825 --> 00:37:48,452
Boss, you know him?

599
00:37:49,461 --> 00:37:50,393
He is Chan Ho Nam

600
00:37:50,929 --> 00:37:52,794
So? Have you screwed that girl yet?

601
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:54,893
What did you say?

602
00:37:55,234 --> 00:37:55,893
Don't you understand?

603
00:37:56,335 --> 00:37:58,166
I said, she doesn't like you at all

604
00:37:58,937 --> 00:38:00,495
He must have cried...

605
00:38:00,806 --> 00:38:01,602
for three days and night!

606
00:38:01,873 --> 00:38:02,931
She doesn't like you either

607
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:05,073
So what? You bastard!

608
00:38:05,244 --> 00:38:06,074
What did you say, Fatty?

609
00:38:07,346 --> 00:38:08,040
What the hell! Don't move!

610
00:38:08,447 --> 00:38:09,311
What's the matter?

611
00:38:10,882 --> 00:38:12,509
Do you want me to lose face?
We are a family!

612
00:38:13,218 --> 00:38:14,048
Piggy, what's the matter?

613
00:38:14,486 --> 00:38:16,420
You want girls? Don't you have enough?

614
00:38:17,022 --> 00:38:17,716
No, boss,

615
00:38:18,023 --> 00:38:19,490
I just want to recruit some
for our brothels

616
00:38:20,826 --> 00:38:22,953
Bee, I am sorry,
they need to be taught a lesson

617
00:38:23,228 --> 00:38:24,559
I'll teach them accordingly

618
00:38:28,166 --> 00:38:29,690
But, you'd better teach yours,

619
00:38:29,935 --> 00:38:31,027
they need a lesson too

620
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:34,864
Brother Kwan, I know what I should do

621
00:38:35,807 --> 00:38:38,674
Let's not bother them, come on!

622
00:38:38,877 --> 00:38:40,242
We'll eat in
the air-conditioned restaurant. Come on

623
00:38:41,013 --> 00:38:43,038
Waiter,
bring us ten bowls of shark-fin soup

624
00:38:50,222 --> 00:38:51,120
Listen, boys

625
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:53,315
We've followed Bee,

626
00:38:54,092 --> 00:38:55,184
so we can't come here anymore

627
00:38:55,794 --> 00:38:57,921
Why?
This is a good place for playing music

628
00:38:58,597 --> 00:38:59,962
No one would complain
about the loud noise!

629
00:39:00,666 --> 00:39:02,531
Stop thinking about the band

630
00:39:02,668 --> 00:39:04,329
I worry that
we would only fight in the future!

631
00:39:06,138 --> 00:39:07,605
You think we are really singers?

632
00:39:07,906 --> 00:39:08,497
Really?

633
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,698
We are rascals

634
00:39:10,742 --> 00:39:11,606
I want to be a hero

635
00:39:12,177 --> 00:39:13,337
I want to be a boss

636
00:39:13,945 --> 00:39:15,344
How about being a lady boss?

637
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,777
I want you to be a concubine!

638
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,539
Get lost, you bastard

639
00:39:44,142 --> 00:39:44,733
I, Chan Ho Nam

640
00:39:44,876 --> 00:39:45,604
I, Chicken

641
00:39:45,877 --> 00:39:47,037
I, Pau-pan

642
00:39:47,312 --> 00:39:48,711
I, Chow-pan,

643
00:39:49,414 --> 00:39:51,609
from this minute onwards,

644
00:39:51,883 --> 00:39:53,077
no separation

645
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:54,811
We will share happiness,

646
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,984
we will share trouble,
we will share food too

647
00:39:58,490 --> 00:39:59,855
Great!

648
00:40:16,408 --> 00:40:17,170
See you!

649
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,040
Bye bye!

650
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:21,739
See you then!

651
00:40:21,947 --> 00:40:22,641
Bye bye!

652
00:40:39,464 --> 00:40:40,328
26, 27...

653
00:40:40,899 --> 00:40:42,025
Would you make it quicker?

654
00:40:50,308 --> 00:40:52,242
Why don't you practise boxing?

655
00:40:52,944 --> 00:40:53,535
What?

656
00:40:55,213 --> 00:40:56,237
How dare you beat my brother?

657
00:41:03,155 --> 00:41:04,144
I'll give you a coffin!

658
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:06,485
It's a bird, you love it

659
00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:07,182
This is for you, bastard!

660
00:41:07,325 --> 00:41:08,189
Triad members!

661
00:41:08,794 --> 00:41:09,954
You want it, the West

662
00:41:11,763 --> 00:41:13,560
West! To hell with you

663
00:41:13,799 --> 00:41:14,493
Do you want some peanuts?

664
00:41:14,666 --> 00:41:15,155
I have got some

665
00:41:25,076 --> 00:41:26,441
Go! Go!

666
00:41:34,986 --> 00:41:35,816
Not for us

667
00:41:36,254 --> 00:41:38,586
We are the Great Four,
we don't charge unless it's necessary!

668
00:41:39,524 --> 00:41:41,685
The Great Four?
People only see us as four sperms

669
00:41:41,827 --> 00:41:42,987
Listen? You sperm!

670
00:41:43,161 --> 00:41:44,492
I am a sperm and you're an egg

671
00:41:59,244 --> 00:42:00,506
You look cool, Ho Nam!

672
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:09,611
Where are you going to?

673
00:42:10,055 --> 00:42:11,044
We are going to have a negotiation

674
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:13,049
Why don't we have weapons?

675
00:42:13,492 --> 00:42:16,017
No need for weapons!
We need to talk, not to fight

676
00:42:16,628 --> 00:42:17,595
Have you come to such a place before?

677
00:42:18,163 --> 00:42:19,630
No, I am 17 only

678
00:42:19,965 --> 00:42:20,989
Aren't they having a negotiation?

679
00:42:21,299 --> 00:42:23,028
We'll do it, not you!

680
00:42:23,268 --> 00:42:25,133
This is my place, enjoy yourself

681
00:42:33,545 --> 00:42:35,877
What are you looking at? Move it!

682
00:42:44,089 --> 00:42:45,886
Big Head, show them to the sofa

683
00:42:46,157 --> 00:42:47,647
I'll go with Bo to talk to Bill

684
00:42:48,093 --> 00:42:48,957
You know this place very well,
don't you?

685
00:42:49,861 --> 00:42:51,886
Get some girls for them

686
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:53,397
Pau-pan, come here

687
00:42:53,532 --> 00:42:54,260
Great

688
00:42:54,633 --> 00:42:55,190
This way...

689
00:42:56,034 --> 00:42:56,625
So grand!

690
00:42:57,068 --> 00:42:58,535
Of course, this is Boss's place

691
00:43:03,542 --> 00:43:04,440
Take a seat

692
00:43:06,378 --> 00:43:08,608
The girls...

693
00:43:08,847 --> 00:43:10,280
are all beautiful!

694
00:43:10,448 --> 00:43:10,937
Really?

695
00:43:11,416 --> 00:43:12,747
May would scold me

696
00:43:13,084 --> 00:43:13,914
Are you kidding?

697
00:43:14,052 --> 00:43:16,384
Are you afraid of being brushed off
by May?

698
00:43:16,721 --> 00:43:17,779
You would brush her off instead!

699
00:43:18,089 --> 00:43:19,852
Keep some savings,
you'll get good health

700
00:43:19,991 --> 00:43:20,889
Gambling is not that bad,

701
00:43:21,026 --> 00:43:22,516
it's better than giving money
to your mother-in-law

702
00:43:22,994 --> 00:43:24,985
You're really corny, you know?

703
00:43:25,297 --> 00:43:26,491
You know!

704
00:43:26,932 --> 00:43:28,331
Boss taught us that

705
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,659
You know!

706
00:43:35,941 --> 00:43:37,431
They don't seem
to be having a negotiation

707
00:43:37,943 --> 00:43:38,671
You mean that guy?

708
00:43:38,877 --> 00:43:40,936
That guy is Bill,
he is from Tung Sing Group

709
00:43:41,546 --> 00:43:43,741
There is a construction site
named Tung Fung Garden in Chai Wan

710
00:43:44,149 --> 00:43:46,014
Boss's taken half the decoration jobs

711
00:43:47,719 --> 00:43:49,687
And the rest goes to the Tung Sing boys

712
00:43:49,921 --> 00:43:52,219
God knows,
that guy didn't stick to the rules

713
00:43:52,457 --> 00:43:54,687
And he dared to tell others that
it's Tung Sing's turf

714
00:43:55,193 --> 00:43:56,285
They don't respect
the Hung Hing Group at all

715
00:43:56,861 --> 00:43:59,022
My buddies and I have run
the decoration business...

716
00:43:59,497 --> 00:44:01,089
for over 20 years

717
00:44:01,566 --> 00:44:04,831
From Western District to Chai Wan,

718
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:07,497
I've contributed so much in this field

719
00:44:08,406 --> 00:44:10,033
You and the Hung Hing Boys
are powerful these days,

720
00:44:11,142 --> 00:44:13,667
but it doesn't mean that
you are good in every field

721
00:44:14,813 --> 00:44:17,907
Handsome boys,
we've got beautiful girls here!

722
00:44:18,249 --> 00:44:21,082
I know you love big tits, this is yours

723
00:44:21,319 --> 00:44:22,752
Bravo! Come on!

724
00:44:22,988 --> 00:44:23,784
What about me?

725
00:44:23,989 --> 00:44:25,047
Don't be anxious!

726
00:44:25,323 --> 00:44:26,756
Come on! Yan-yee, come quickly

727
00:44:26,992 --> 00:44:28,186
Woo, you're giving her to me?

728
00:44:28,326 --> 00:44:29,418
She's very attentive

729
00:44:29,628 --> 00:44:30,754
This is Boyboy

730
00:44:33,965 --> 00:44:34,954
May I know your name?

731
00:44:36,134 --> 00:44:39,797
Big Head,
Fei's got some clients over there,

732
00:44:39,938 --> 00:44:41,303
she'll come later

733
00:44:41,973 --> 00:44:43,201
Take another girl, OK?

734
00:44:43,742 --> 00:44:44,606
She knows I'm here!

735
00:44:44,809 --> 00:44:46,834
Of course! You know her very well,

736
00:44:46,978 --> 00:44:48,502
she doesn't express much on her face

737
00:44:49,114 --> 00:44:50,479
You are...

738
00:44:51,249 --> 00:44:53,410
very special!

739
00:44:53,551 --> 00:44:55,416
Your head stinks!

740
00:44:56,121 --> 00:44:56,678
Did you wash your hair?

741
00:44:57,555 --> 00:44:58,351
Had a quarrel?

742
00:44:59,090 --> 00:44:59,784
No

743
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:04,021
Enjoy yourself,

744
00:45:04,262 --> 00:45:05,024
OK?

745
00:45:05,697 --> 00:45:07,221
My name is Yan-yee, what's your name?

746
00:45:07,365 --> 00:45:07,797
You are Yan-yee?

747
00:45:07,932 --> 00:45:08,398
Yes

748
00:45:08,533 --> 00:45:10,160
I think you should be called Fatty

749
00:45:10,902 --> 00:45:11,926
You are fat!

750
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:13,032
Can't you hear that?

751
00:45:13,338 --> 00:45:14,032
You are so bad!

752
00:45:14,172 --> 00:45:15,264
Kiss! Have a kiss!

753
00:45:15,674 --> 00:45:16,766
No!

754
00:45:17,742 --> 00:45:19,141
Don't rape me!

755
00:45:19,444 --> 00:45:20,468
Let's play the guessing game

756
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:22,476
I don't like playing guessing games

757
00:45:22,714 --> 00:45:25,274
Well, show me your palm!

758
00:45:27,452 --> 00:45:29,249
Let me measure it!

759
00:45:31,723 --> 00:45:33,884
Hey, he's got a short dick!

760
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:37,219
His dick is this long!

761
00:45:37,929 --> 00:45:40,124
How about mine?

762
00:45:40,932 --> 00:45:42,991
Woo, his is this short!

763
00:45:43,134 --> 00:45:45,261
So that's what you think of me!

764
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:47,335
My palm is fake! I...

765
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:48,771
Let me show you!

766
00:45:49,507 --> 00:45:50,599
Can you get it?

767
00:45:51,843 --> 00:45:52,741
I have put it right here!

768
00:45:59,484 --> 00:46:02,317
I just come to say hello,
my client has booked me

769
00:46:03,088 --> 00:46:04,612
I told you I would be coming

770
00:46:05,356 --> 00:46:06,323
I forgot to bring my pager

771
00:46:07,158 --> 00:46:08,147
Well, go cancel your booking

772
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,720
I need to follow
the regulations of the club

773
00:46:10,228 --> 00:46:12,560
Who is that guy?
I will cancel it for you

774
00:46:13,131 --> 00:46:14,359
None of your business

775
00:46:15,133 --> 00:46:17,328
As you like! I'm here on business anyway

776
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:29,269
Thank you

777
00:46:30,315 --> 00:46:30,974
Welcome

778
00:46:42,627 --> 00:46:44,288
Come on! Let's play the guessing game!

779
00:46:44,429 --> 00:46:44,827
Come on!

780
00:46:44,963 --> 00:46:45,622
Okay

781
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:46,521
How about Chicken's game?

782
00:46:46,664 --> 00:46:47,187
Well, come on!

783
00:46:47,332 --> 00:46:48,299
Chicken chicken,

784
00:46:48,433 --> 00:46:49,127
how many are there?

785
00:46:49,267 --> 00:46:49,995
Come on, why don't you talk to me?

786
00:46:50,135 --> 00:46:50,726
Are you a man?

787
00:46:51,503 --> 00:46:52,970
You look like a man!

788
00:46:53,104 --> 00:46:55,368
No, she looks more like a man,
she has a moustache...

789
00:46:55,874 --> 00:46:57,205
No, this is a woman! Look!

790
00:46:57,342 --> 00:46:58,274
There are three tits!

791
00:46:58,443 --> 00:47:00,138
One two three, look, three tits

792
00:47:00,345 --> 00:47:01,175
You are so bad!

793
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:02,872
Woo, you have three tits!

794
00:47:06,151 --> 00:47:08,346
Brother Bee, thank you for your treat!

795
00:47:09,554 --> 00:47:10,384
I'll be the boss next time

796
00:47:14,325 --> 00:47:16,850
Bee, Sha-man asked me
to send his regards to you

797
00:47:17,796 --> 00:47:19,423
When will you come to my nightclubs...

798
00:47:19,564 --> 00:47:20,656
for a drink?

799
00:47:21,366 --> 00:47:23,357
Sure, I will come!

800
00:47:24,002 --> 00:47:25,833
Thank you! See you then

801
00:47:33,378 --> 00:47:34,106
I'll be right back!

802
00:47:39,584 --> 00:47:40,516
Let's dance!

803
00:48:16,688 --> 00:48:17,814
Bee, you having fun?

804
00:48:18,223 --> 00:48:19,986
Hey, Key, cut the bull shit!

805
00:48:20,592 --> 00:48:21,581
I bring my kids here...

806
00:48:21,726 --> 00:48:22,715
to show them the world

807
00:48:23,061 --> 00:48:24,255
If you always...

808
00:48:24,429 --> 00:48:26,989
take them to nightclubs,
massage centres and brothels,

809
00:48:27,131 --> 00:48:28,564
they will be Ioyal to you forever

810
00:48:29,067 --> 00:48:30,591
I am not in the mood, see you later

811
00:48:32,804 --> 00:48:33,498
Boss!

812
00:48:34,172 --> 00:48:35,935
Po, get me two girls

813
00:48:36,541 --> 00:48:37,337
I want to double the fun tonight

814
00:48:38,009 --> 00:48:39,874
All of you should go with me!

815
00:48:40,111 --> 00:48:40,805
Good!

816
00:48:41,112 --> 00:48:41,908
Boss, you are great!

817
00:48:49,954 --> 00:48:52,047
Is this your first time?
Why are you so nervous?

818
00:48:54,025 --> 00:48:55,925
They said you are a virgin

819
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:57,493
So I've prepared a red pocket for you

820
00:48:58,963 --> 00:48:59,622
Thank you!

821
00:49:06,004 --> 00:49:07,130
Woo, it's hard!

822
00:49:07,272 --> 00:49:07,897
Really?

823
00:49:08,039 --> 00:49:08,767
Yes

824
00:49:14,479 --> 00:49:16,276
Be a bit more professional,

825
00:49:16,414 --> 00:49:17,244
would you?

826
00:49:17,382 --> 00:49:18,644
Just do it!

827
00:49:27,525 --> 00:49:29,550
Can you hear? They are having real fun!

828
00:49:41,439 --> 00:49:43,737
You paid me, but you don't want to do it

829
00:49:44,075 --> 00:49:45,542
Shall we do it for free

830
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,745
I just want to hear you screaming, OK?

831
00:49:59,324 --> 00:50:01,485
Why do you scream?
You haven't taken off your pants yet

832
00:50:03,261 --> 00:50:04,421
I'm done!

833
00:50:04,762 --> 00:50:06,059
You're useless!

834
00:50:06,497 --> 00:50:09,091
It was very hard just now!

835
00:50:09,534 --> 00:50:10,159
I am sorry!

836
00:50:14,505 --> 00:50:15,130
Chan Ho Nam

837
00:50:24,983 --> 00:50:26,575
Are you still going to school?

838
00:50:27,552 --> 00:50:28,712
Nope! How about you?

839
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:29,811
I...

840
00:50:31,089 --> 00:50:33,455
I will be going to UK to study

841
00:50:40,098 --> 00:50:43,898
It's good!
Work hard, since you've got a chance!

842
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:47,260
Do you think they've...

843
00:50:50,108 --> 00:50:51,132
Why are you so sneaky?

844
00:50:52,377 --> 00:50:54,072
My friends are over there

845
00:51:06,457 --> 00:51:07,389
Too bad I wasn't there that day

846
00:51:07,792 --> 00:51:09,259
If I threatened them
with Brother Bee's name...

847
00:51:09,427 --> 00:51:10,587
You'd have suffered more

848
00:51:12,296 --> 00:51:13,729
Boss, look who is talking!

849
00:51:14,365 --> 00:51:15,525
Sorry, boss

850
00:51:18,136 --> 00:51:19,831
Do you see those two pimps?

851
00:51:20,371 --> 00:51:20,962
Where will you go tomorrow?

852
00:51:22,807 --> 00:51:23,899
Go beat them

853
00:51:25,109 --> 00:51:25,700
Why?

854
00:51:26,844 --> 00:51:28,607
They look ugly! I just hate them

855
00:51:29,514 --> 00:51:30,173
Are you scared?

856
00:51:31,482 --> 00:51:32,380
Move it

857
00:51:36,387 --> 00:51:37,376
Boss, want some?

858
00:51:41,325 --> 00:51:42,155
None of your business!

859
00:51:42,493 --> 00:51:43,152
Kid, what are you doing here?

860
00:51:43,494 --> 00:51:43,960
What's the matter?

861
00:51:44,262 --> 00:51:44,626
Don't fight!

862
00:51:45,763 --> 00:51:47,924
Shut up, bitch!
I would beat you if you don't shut up

863
00:51:49,634 --> 00:51:50,566
Boss, should we help them?

864
00:51:51,469 --> 00:51:52,060
Help?

865
00:51:52,937 --> 00:51:54,598
It's just to test their nerves

866
00:51:57,575 --> 00:51:58,234
Stop it!

867
00:51:58,609 --> 00:51:58,938
How dare you attack!

868
00:52:07,585 --> 00:52:08,813
Beat him harder! Chicken, Pau-pan, hit!

869
00:52:09,287 --> 00:52:10,151
Harder! Hit harder!

870
00:52:21,499 --> 00:52:22,193
Stop!

871
00:52:23,267 --> 00:52:23,699
Stop!

872
00:52:23,901 --> 00:52:25,061
Cops are coming!

873
00:52:25,336 --> 00:52:26,064
Run...

874
00:52:26,204 --> 00:52:27,262
Run!

875
00:52:29,006 --> 00:52:29,734
To hell with you!

876
00:52:30,808 --> 00:52:31,672
Run! Cops are coming

877
00:52:31,876 --> 00:52:32,365
No!

878
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:33,602
Run! Run

879
00:52:40,051 --> 00:52:40,847
Why were you beaten?

880
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:41,813
I don't know

881
00:52:41,953 --> 00:52:42,715
I.D. card

882
00:52:42,887 --> 00:52:43,819
You should be the one to check it out

883
00:52:45,356 --> 00:52:46,687
35013 calling control

884
00:52:47,058 --> 00:52:47,888
I am so happy!

885
00:52:59,003 --> 00:52:59,526
Am I like a sexpot?

886
00:52:59,737 --> 00:53:00,567
I tell you,

887
00:53:00,705 --> 00:53:03,435
I know the best massage girls here

888
00:53:03,574 --> 00:53:07,806
Number 168, 167, 169 and 19

889
00:53:08,312 --> 00:53:09,836
Why do people call
this place "M" Centre?

890
00:53:10,047 --> 00:53:12,038
M for masturbation, you know?

891
00:53:23,294 --> 00:53:23,885
It's so hot!

892
00:53:24,729 --> 00:53:26,356
You'll dry up one day, bastard!

893
00:53:26,998 --> 00:53:28,090
The expert said,

894
00:53:28,232 --> 00:53:30,928
a man can produce
20 litres of "soy milk" in his life

895
00:53:31,335 --> 00:53:33,360
I've just used 2 litres

896
00:53:33,704 --> 00:53:34,898
You mean coke? 2 litres of coke?

897
00:53:35,406 --> 00:53:36,338
Yes, it's coke

898
00:53:41,546 --> 00:53:42,171
I know it too

899
00:53:42,713 --> 00:53:43,441
Doggie's stance

900
00:53:44,782 --> 00:53:45,714
Help!

901
00:53:45,883 --> 00:53:46,815
To hell with you! Chicken!

902
00:53:47,451 --> 00:53:48,076
Doggie's stance

903
00:53:48,352 --> 00:53:49,114
I won't let you go!

904
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:50,814
Are you happy, boys?

905
00:53:51,189 --> 00:53:52,349
Boss! We feel great!

906
00:53:52,957 --> 00:53:53,446
How dare you bully me?

907
00:53:54,058 --> 00:53:54,649
Boss

908
00:53:56,427 --> 00:53:57,086
Isn't it funny?

909
00:53:57,595 --> 00:53:58,084
It's great!

910
00:53:58,462 --> 00:54:01,556
Boss, I thought you have
only tattooed your arms

911
00:54:01,699 --> 00:54:03,599
You look cool!

912
00:54:03,768 --> 00:54:04,996
There is a pair of eagles on his chest

913
00:54:05,136 --> 00:54:06,034
My name is Chicken,

914
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:08,400
I think I should tattoo a-chicken

915
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:09,731
How about with claws?

916
00:54:10,007 --> 00:54:11,668
I am named Pau-pan,
should I tattoo a pan?

917
00:54:11,876 --> 00:54:13,104
You should tattoo it on your ass

918
00:54:13,244 --> 00:54:16,145
You should tattoo it in your...

919
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,247
asshole!

920
00:54:17,548 --> 00:54:18,913
A tattoo is not a joke

921
00:54:21,586 --> 00:54:22,382
Come on!

922
00:54:22,954 --> 00:54:24,353
This represents
the name of my first lover,

923
00:54:24,722 --> 00:54:26,280
who is also my present wife

924
00:54:26,757 --> 00:54:29,590
I tattooed it on my body,
it will be with me forever

925
00:54:30,595 --> 00:54:32,654
Do you know how long
it takes to tattoo all this?

926
00:54:32,964 --> 00:54:33,430
How long?

927
00:54:34,498 --> 00:54:37,296
It took me a long time,
I did it whenever I was free

928
00:54:37,435 --> 00:54:38,732
It took me five years altogether

929
00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:41,138
Is it painful?

930
00:54:41,439 --> 00:54:43,134
It's very painful!

931
00:54:43,507 --> 00:54:44,098
Really?

932
00:54:44,542 --> 00:54:45,634
A tattoo will follow you
for the rest of your life

933
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:47,575
Once a rascal, always a rascal

934
00:54:48,746 --> 00:54:50,771
When you make some money...

935
00:54:51,215 --> 00:54:53,149
and want to join the upper class,

936
00:54:53,417 --> 00:54:54,441
people will know your background

937
00:54:54,952 --> 00:54:55,941
Once they consider you a rascal,

938
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,049
they'll always consider you a rascal

939
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:00,982
You guys are still green

940
00:55:02,059 --> 00:55:02,957
There's still much to learn

941
00:55:03,861 --> 00:55:05,226
Take your time, don't rush

942
00:55:10,401 --> 00:55:11,425
I am a triad member!

943
00:55:17,108 --> 00:55:18,632
I am giving you
a chance to achieve something

944
00:55:20,144 --> 00:55:21,008
Killing Bill is not...

945
00:55:21,212 --> 00:55:22,941
the same as going after rascals or pimps

946
00:55:24,115 --> 00:55:25,207
The workers are strong

947
00:55:25,449 --> 00:55:27,212
If you fight one to one, you may not win

948
00:55:28,452 --> 00:55:30,147
So I'm not sending
Big Head and Po to do it

949
00:55:30,721 --> 00:55:32,689
Since you are green,
Bill won't recognise you

950
00:55:33,157 --> 00:55:34,249
And,

951
00:55:34,825 --> 00:55:37,020
you are all underaged. If you're caught,

952
00:55:37,295 --> 00:55:38,626
you'll only be sent to the Boy's Home

953
00:55:39,764 --> 00:55:41,095
Tomorrow, you're going to kill

954
00:55:41,799 --> 00:55:43,232
Sharpen your weapons tonight

955
00:55:44,168 --> 00:55:45,362
Po will drive you there

956
00:55:46,103 --> 00:55:47,161
Ho Nam, it's your show

957
00:55:51,842 --> 00:55:52,934
I trust you!

958
00:55:54,478 --> 00:55:59,438
I can't even kill a chicken,
how do I kill a person?

959
00:56:00,284 --> 00:56:02,878
Bill is so muscular,
it's hard to get close to him

960
00:56:03,154 --> 00:56:05,213
Just stab our knife in

961
00:56:05,556 --> 00:56:06,523
His blood will then come out,

962
00:56:06,657 --> 00:56:08,022
he will lie on the floor
to cry for help...

963
00:56:08,292 --> 00:56:09,725
suddenly, he will use his last breath...

964
00:56:10,127 --> 00:56:12,459
He will bite your tits...

965
00:56:14,065 --> 00:56:14,895
Stop it!

966
00:56:16,801 --> 00:56:17,733
Just for fun!

967
00:56:17,868 --> 00:56:18,892
Why are you so serious?

968
00:56:20,004 --> 00:56:22,973
Nam, you are not sharpening it this way

969
00:56:24,208 --> 00:56:25,232
I just don't want it to be so sharp

970
00:56:26,177 --> 00:56:26,973
Why not?

971
00:56:27,311 --> 00:56:29,279
If it is not sharp enough to kill,

972
00:56:29,413 --> 00:56:30,710
they will have a chance to fight back

973
00:56:31,916 --> 00:56:33,850
The sharper the better

974
00:56:33,984 --> 00:56:35,144
I need to go to the toilet

975
00:56:35,286 --> 00:56:36,116
Just go ahead

976
00:56:36,387 --> 00:56:38,947
Take your time! I'll be right back

977
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:40,250
I am working! You nuts!

978
00:56:47,965 --> 00:56:48,659
So?

979
00:56:49,867 --> 00:56:52,392
Tomorrow, you're going to kill,
I am afraid,

980
00:56:52,903 --> 00:56:53,767
can you stay?

981
00:56:54,138 --> 00:56:55,298
Of course not

982
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:58,909
Don't worry, I'll be fine

983
00:57:03,481 --> 00:57:04,709
Please don't go

984
00:57:05,649 --> 00:57:07,048
I have to

985
00:57:07,852 --> 00:57:13,449
Woo, what a touching scene!
"You jump, I jump!"

986
00:57:13,824 --> 00:57:15,223
Come on! Let's do it

987
00:57:15,426 --> 00:57:17,223
Damn you Chicken! I wanna kill you!

988
00:57:37,114 --> 00:57:38,445
Why can't I sleep?

989
00:57:40,418 --> 00:57:41,908
Tomorrow seems to be...

990
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,515
I don't know... I am just so afraid

991
00:57:56,267 --> 00:57:57,029
Can't you sleep?

992
00:57:57,535 --> 00:57:58,467
I wish I can

993
00:58:07,478 --> 00:58:10,276
Bill has a second wife living in Mongkok

994
00:58:10,614 --> 00:58:12,707
Every Saturday, he will visit the woman

995
00:58:13,083 --> 00:58:15,074
Remember, he is driving an old Accord

996
00:58:28,833 --> 00:58:31,233
Where are the weapons?

997
00:58:32,269 --> 00:58:33,258
The weapons?

998
00:58:34,338 --> 00:58:35,430
Chow-pan is responsible
for carrying them

999
00:58:35,673 --> 00:58:37,664
How can he leave that to a woman?

1000
00:58:38,275 --> 00:58:39,264
Those are weapons!

1001
00:58:39,877 --> 00:58:41,242
It's better for a woman to carry them

1002
00:58:41,412 --> 00:58:42,743
The cops are less likely
to search a woman

1003
00:58:48,519 --> 00:58:49,713
Will it be all right?

1004
00:58:51,155 --> 00:58:52,679
It's be fine! Stay calm

1005
00:58:52,890 --> 00:58:54,653
You go home first, OK?

1006
00:58:58,095 --> 00:59:01,087
Hey, there are cops!

1007
00:59:05,069 --> 00:59:06,001
Stay calm

1008
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:10,602
Girl, where are you going to?

1009
00:59:12,977 --> 00:59:13,807
I have got an I.D.

1010
00:59:14,678 --> 00:59:16,009
What is inside? Open the bag and show me

1011
00:59:16,413 --> 00:59:17,471
It's all books!

1012
00:59:18,382 --> 00:59:19,474
She doesn't seem to be a whore

1013
00:59:19,617 --> 00:59:20,845
Come on, leave the girl alone. Let's go

1014
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:30,588
Where are the weapons?

1015
00:59:30,961 --> 00:59:31,985
We were just questioned by the cops

1016
00:59:32,596 --> 00:59:33,290
I am sorry!

1017
00:59:33,430 --> 00:59:34,590
Sorry? What'd we do now?

1018
00:59:35,266 --> 00:59:36,494
What do we do without weapons?

1019
00:59:37,234 --> 00:59:38,166
Let's do it on another day

1020
00:59:38,435 --> 00:59:39,197
What?

1021
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:40,930
This is the first time
we are asked to kill,

1022
00:59:41,071 --> 00:59:41,969
you want me to delay it?

1023
00:59:42,473 --> 00:59:44,532
How can we face the world?

1024
00:59:45,576 --> 00:59:47,544
I wanna shit now!

1025
00:59:47,945 --> 00:59:50,778
I think I've eaten something wrong

1026
00:59:51,482 --> 00:59:52,073
I wanna go to the toilet...

1027
01:00:04,461 --> 01:00:05,223
Nam, what should we do now?

1028
01:00:06,063 --> 01:00:06,791
Just keep to our plan

1029
01:00:06,931 --> 01:00:07,693
But...

1030
01:00:07,932 --> 01:00:08,626
are we going to kill with our hands?

1031
01:00:27,618 --> 01:00:28,710
Damn you! How dare you attack me?

1032
01:00:29,486 --> 01:00:30,214
How dare you!

1033
01:00:35,526 --> 01:00:36,356
Why are you fighting?

1034
01:00:38,596 --> 01:00:40,188
Damn it! Stop!

1035
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,394
Damn you bastard! Stay where you are!

1036
01:00:49,907 --> 01:00:50,931
Stop!

1037
01:00:55,512 --> 01:00:56,444
Bastard! Stop!

1038
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:20,866
Nam, run!

1039
01:01:22,673 --> 01:01:23,435
Nam!

1040
01:01:24,675 --> 01:01:25,369
Wait for me!

1041
01:01:25,743 --> 01:01:26,334
Run!

1042
01:01:28,779 --> 01:01:29,541
Run!

1043
01:01:31,015 --> 01:01:31,572
Let's run!

1044
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:43,283
Nam!

1045
01:01:51,435 --> 01:01:52,094
The cops are here

1046
01:01:52,536 --> 01:01:53,969
Sir, take the bastards away!

1047
01:02:12,089 --> 01:02:13,488
Nam, run!

1048
01:02:14,258 --> 01:02:14,815
Run for your life...

1049
01:02:29,873 --> 01:02:31,568
Boy, you're so careless!

1050
01:02:31,909 --> 01:02:32,739
Miss, what is this place?

1051
01:02:33,444 --> 01:02:34,536
This is Portland Street

1052
01:02:35,279 --> 01:02:36,871
I... I lost my way home

1053
01:02:37,014 --> 01:02:38,276
Is there any bus heading for Nam Tin?

1054
01:02:39,016 --> 01:02:41,109
You are not a child anymore,
Hong Kong is not that big

1055
01:02:41,251 --> 01:02:43,219
How can you lose your way home?
Are you a Mainlander?

1056
01:02:43,387 --> 01:02:45,150
There is a minibus to Nam Tin,

1057
01:02:45,289 --> 01:02:46,051
do you have any change?

1058
01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:47,957
Yes, Miss, thank you so much!

1059
01:02:49,693 --> 01:02:51,752
You little bitch! Being nice, huh?

1060
01:02:52,362 --> 01:02:53,920
No big deal

1061
01:02:54,865 --> 01:02:56,332
Here we are! Hold it...

1062
01:02:57,968 --> 01:02:59,299
Don't sleep!

1063
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:05,406
Grandma, open up please

1064
01:03:05,542 --> 01:03:06,372
Open up!

1065
01:03:12,616 --> 01:03:14,106
Chow-pan, get some bandages

1066
01:03:14,351 --> 01:03:15,784
Get a towel, I want to stop the bleeding

1067
01:03:16,453 --> 01:03:17,852
Towel, bandage, anything would do

1068
01:03:18,088 --> 01:03:19,180
Get me anything

1069
01:03:19,523 --> 01:03:21,320
Where are the towels? Fast!

1070
01:03:22,493 --> 01:03:23,289
I am searching for it

1071
01:03:23,494 --> 01:03:24,461
I can't find it! Grandma,
do you have a towel?

1072
01:03:24,995 --> 01:03:25,654
Search for it

1073
01:03:25,896 --> 01:03:26,487
I can't find it

1074
01:03:28,432 --> 01:03:30,400
I can't find it!

1075
01:03:30,901 --> 01:03:31,993
Chow-pan, quick

1076
01:03:32,336 --> 01:03:33,769
I am searching

1077
01:03:34,371 --> 01:03:34,860
Nam, you will be alright

1078
01:03:38,842 --> 01:03:39,331
Who is it?

1079
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:40,204
It's May

1080
01:03:40,878 --> 01:03:41,845
Bastard, it's your girl

1081
01:03:44,548 --> 01:03:45,173
Come in

1082
01:03:45,883 --> 01:03:48,249
What's the matter?
Why is he bleeding that badly?

1083
01:03:48,385 --> 01:03:49,647
Forget it!
Get something to stop the bleeding first

1084
01:03:49,787 --> 01:03:50,378
Give me a hand

1085
01:03:52,956 --> 01:03:53,945
May, do you have anything there?

1086
01:03:54,458 --> 01:03:56,983
Hurry up! Speed up, would you?

1087
01:03:57,361 --> 01:03:58,191
Nam will bleed to death!

1088
01:03:58,395 --> 01:03:59,020
Shut up!

1089
01:04:02,699 --> 01:04:03,563
Luckily he is not having a fever

1090
01:04:04,735 --> 01:04:05,360
Give me a cigarette

1091
01:04:08,472 --> 01:04:09,700
Tear it up. I want the tobacco

1092
01:04:10,808 --> 01:04:13,174
Chow-pan,
get me some bandages and scissors

1093
01:04:13,744 --> 01:04:14,472
Yes, scissors

1094
01:04:20,584 --> 01:04:21,175
Grandma, scissors

1095
01:04:24,721 --> 01:04:25,415
Grandma, here is the tobacco

1096
01:04:26,423 --> 01:04:28,550
Tobacco mixed with Yuenam powder
will stop his bleeding

1097
01:04:30,494 --> 01:04:31,153
It'll be alright

1098
01:04:32,362 --> 01:04:33,420
A real man will not be afraid of pain

1099
01:04:37,167 --> 01:04:38,532
If Nam didn't return to save me,

1100
01:04:39,002 --> 01:04:40,401
he wouldn't have been injured

1101
01:04:41,071 --> 01:04:41,799
You silly boy!

1102
01:04:44,408 --> 01:04:45,272
Hang on!

1103
01:04:47,444 --> 01:04:48,706
Where is Pau-pan?

1104
01:04:49,513 --> 01:04:50,241
Where is he?

1105
01:04:50,881 --> 01:04:51,905
I don't know your brother is that stupid

1106
01:04:52,049 --> 01:04:53,277
He must have been killed

1107
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:54,244
What did you say?

1108
01:04:54,551 --> 01:04:55,142
So what?

1109
01:04:55,519 --> 01:04:56,417
Shut up!

1110
01:04:56,553 --> 01:04:58,111
You should have
taken care of your brother

1111
01:04:58,388 --> 01:04:59,355
You should have taken care of your buddy

1112
01:04:59,823 --> 01:05:01,017
Shit!

1113
01:05:01,425 --> 01:05:02,084
I don't know anything!

1114
01:05:02,659 --> 01:05:04,217
I am going to buy some pain-killers

1115
01:05:05,229 --> 01:05:07,356
Grandma, I've got something useful

1116
01:05:07,497 --> 01:05:08,555
Are you kidding? That's your brother!

1117
01:05:08,699 --> 01:05:10,064
I don't know, stop bothering me!

1118
01:05:10,234 --> 01:05:11,895
Go search for him!

1119
01:05:12,035 --> 01:05:13,593
Nam, do you feel better now?

1120
01:05:14,638 --> 01:05:15,161
Brother!

1121
01:05:15,505 --> 01:05:16,335
Pau-pan, where have you been?

1122
01:05:18,942 --> 01:05:19,567
Brother!

1123
01:05:20,677 --> 01:05:21,507
Where the hell have you been?

1124
01:05:23,146 --> 01:05:24,044
I am worrying about you!

1125
01:05:27,618 --> 01:05:28,880
Where have you been?

1126
01:05:29,753 --> 01:05:31,414
I... I lost my way home

1127
01:05:32,623 --> 01:05:33,783
You silly boy!

1128
01:05:35,092 --> 01:05:36,423
Let's drink a cup of tea first

1129
01:05:42,499 --> 01:05:43,659
Drink it, it'll calm you down

1130
01:05:57,614 --> 01:05:58,979
Nam, it will kill your pain

1131
01:05:59,549 --> 01:06:00,208
It's better than pain killers

1132
01:06:19,903 --> 01:06:20,927
Help!

1133
01:06:39,423 --> 01:06:40,788
Chan Ho Nam

1134
01:06:46,730 --> 01:06:50,928
I wanna kill you!

1135
01:06:54,671 --> 01:06:55,365
To hell with you!

1136
01:07:00,777 --> 01:07:01,539
Brother Bee Kwan

1137
01:07:02,379 --> 01:07:03,607
Let's talk out there

1138
01:07:03,747 --> 01:07:05,112
What the hell is it?

1139
01:07:05,949 --> 01:07:07,678
Before the God of Kwan,

1140
01:07:08,085 --> 01:07:11,213
everyone should be righteous and honest

1141
01:07:11,555 --> 01:07:13,079
This shows my sincerity, right?

1142
01:07:13,523 --> 01:07:15,991
Kwan, are you sick?
You talk about sincerity?

1143
01:07:17,361 --> 01:07:18,988
Bee, I am so sincere in front of you,

1144
01:07:19,629 --> 01:07:20,254
are you teasing me?

1145
01:07:20,931 --> 01:07:21,955
I'm just bluffing!

1146
01:07:22,466 --> 01:07:23,296
Well, two things

1147
01:07:26,169 --> 01:07:29,434
Nam was hurt by Piggy,
it's none of my business

1148
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:32,270
What? Piggy is your fellow!

1149
01:07:32,476 --> 01:07:33,534
That bastard betrayed me and

1150
01:07:33,710 --> 01:07:36,304
followed Sha-man! It drives me mad!

1151
01:07:36,646 --> 01:07:37,943
You can ask Blackie

1152
01:07:38,515 --> 01:07:39,607
He asked me to go with him,

1153
01:07:39,816 --> 01:07:41,443
but I am Ioyal

1154
01:07:41,785 --> 01:07:42,843
Okay, that's enough

1155
01:07:44,054 --> 01:07:45,612
Well, I envy you, Brother Bee

1156
01:07:45,756 --> 01:07:47,053
All your fellows are Ioyal to you!

1157
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:48,555
I should learn from you

1158
01:07:49,626 --> 01:07:51,594
What you're saying
is that Piggy's attack...

1159
01:07:51,795 --> 01:07:53,524
wasn't under your control

1160
01:07:53,964 --> 01:07:57,127
Brother Bee,
I've really got nothing to do with it

1161
01:07:58,702 --> 01:07:59,464
How about the other thing?

1162
01:07:59,836 --> 01:08:01,269
It's good new

1163
01:08:02,139 --> 01:08:03,231
I'm doing...

1164
01:08:03,573 --> 01:08:05,700
some decoration business in Yuen Long,

1165
01:08:05,842 --> 01:08:07,139
we'll collect land and

1166
01:08:07,344 --> 01:08:08,675
build over 200 villas

1167
01:08:08,912 --> 01:08:09,606
I want you to be my partner

1168
01:08:09,813 --> 01:08:11,405
So nice of you!

1169
01:08:11,848 --> 01:08:14,078
Well, it takes quite a long time...

1170
01:08:14,518 --> 01:08:16,281
to collect enough land

1171
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:17,878
Your future looks bright

1172
01:08:18,255 --> 01:08:21,156
After the death of Bill,
the whole Tung Fung Garden will be yours

1173
01:08:21,291 --> 01:08:22,451
You'll be damn rich!

1174
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:23,988
Will you let me join you?

1175
01:08:24,194 --> 01:08:25,525
Sure, no problem!

1176
01:08:25,796 --> 01:08:28,663
We belong to the same gang,
I'll of course co-operate with you

1177
01:08:29,032 --> 01:08:30,761
Well,
among the branch leaders of Hung Hing,

1178
01:08:30,901 --> 01:08:33,267
Bee is the most righteous guy!

1179
01:08:33,837 --> 01:08:36,704
Let's make money together

1180
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:38,467
But something needs to be done first

1181
01:08:38,742 --> 01:08:39,606
Will you give me a hand?

1182
01:08:39,876 --> 01:08:41,207
Sure!

1183
01:08:41,344 --> 01:08:43,244
We are a family, right?

1184
01:08:44,714 --> 01:08:45,908
Brother Bee, may I ask...

1185
01:08:47,184 --> 01:08:49,345
How is Nam now?

1186
01:08:49,619 --> 01:08:51,246
Tung Sing boys and the cops
are all looking for him

1187
01:08:51,855 --> 01:08:52,617
Thank you for your concern

1188
01:08:54,591 --> 01:08:56,183
It's killing me!

1189
01:08:56,626 --> 01:08:57,650
Boss...

1190
01:08:58,261 --> 01:09:01,196
Boss, I am in great pain!

1191
01:09:01,998 --> 01:09:05,399
Let me smoke!
I will quit it, I swear! Boss...

1192
01:09:05,602 --> 01:09:09,333
It's killing me! I feel cold!

1193
01:09:09,473 --> 01:09:10,633
Ho Nam is feeling cold!
Please give it to him!

1194
01:09:10,841 --> 01:09:12,035
How dare you take heroin?

1195
01:09:12,342 --> 01:09:13,741
Just once, OK?

1196
01:09:15,112 --> 01:09:16,170
I will quit it!

1197
01:09:16,379 --> 01:09:18,074
Don't beat me, boss

1198
01:09:20,951 --> 01:09:22,578
Ho Nam is feeling cold,
give it to him please

1199
01:09:22,752 --> 01:09:24,276
Feeling cold? It'll kill you, you know?

1200
01:09:24,554 --> 01:09:25,316
You will die!

1201
01:09:25,555 --> 01:09:26,283
Ho Nam is freezing!

1202
01:09:26,423 --> 01:09:28,721
Boss, just once! OK?

1203
01:09:29,025 --> 01:09:30,356
Boss, no!

1204
01:09:31,428 --> 01:09:32,520
I dare not do that again!

1205
01:09:33,130 --> 01:09:35,121
How dare you take heroin?

1206
01:09:35,499 --> 01:09:36,056
Boss!

1207
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:37,496
Let me go...

1208
01:09:40,170 --> 01:09:41,398
No! Boss!

1209
01:09:43,006 --> 01:09:43,973
Enough!

1210
01:09:45,242 --> 01:09:46,732
I am sorry, I am freezing!

1211
01:09:47,444 --> 01:09:49,912
Let me go!

1212
01:10:01,057 --> 01:10:02,649
Leave these two bastards alone! Go!

1213
01:10:02,826 --> 01:10:04,521
Don't go!

1214
01:10:08,064 --> 01:10:09,156
Boss, no!

1215
01:10:09,332 --> 01:10:11,027
Boss, don't leave us alone

1216
01:10:21,645 --> 01:10:22,737
Boss, have some tea

1217
01:10:31,721 --> 01:10:33,348
Take these pain killers to the kids

1218
01:10:44,568 --> 01:10:45,330
Hurry up!

1219
01:10:48,004 --> 01:10:50,370
Don't beat us! No!

1220
01:10:51,174 --> 01:10:51,833
It's not his fault

1221
01:10:52,242 --> 01:10:52,867
Come out!

1222
01:10:53,810 --> 01:10:54,799
I am not going to beat you, come out

1223
01:10:56,179 --> 01:10:56,907
Each of you take two

1224
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:57,842
Look at Chicken!

1225
01:10:58,949 --> 01:10:59,540
Nam, take it

1226
01:11:08,491 --> 01:11:08,980
Are you alright?

1227
01:11:23,573 --> 01:11:24,938
Are you alright?

1228
01:11:27,277 --> 01:11:27,971
I feel better now

1229
01:11:29,846 --> 01:11:31,609
Aren't you angry with me
for beating you so badly?

1230
01:11:34,684 --> 01:11:35,708
My father died early,

1231
01:11:36,886 --> 01:11:39,684
I haven't been beaten that badly before

1232
01:11:41,658 --> 01:11:43,649
Heroin will ruin your life

1233
01:11:44,461 --> 01:11:47,055
It hurts me to beat you, you know?

1234
01:11:48,164 --> 01:11:49,426
I know you did it for my own good

1235
01:11:50,767 --> 01:11:52,496
I'll take to Camel
about the Tung Sing case

1236
01:11:53,003 --> 01:11:54,095
You'd better hide in Macau for a while

1237
01:12:34,377 --> 01:12:35,366
Give me a wonton, OK?

1238
01:12:35,612 --> 01:12:36,579
I want it too

1239
01:12:39,082 --> 01:12:39,514
What do you want?

1240
01:12:39,649 --> 01:12:40,581
Let me feed you some brisket

1241
01:12:40,817 --> 01:12:41,943
It's rather hot!

1242
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:45,109
Do you want some knuckle?

1243
01:12:45,722 --> 01:12:47,417
Come on,

1244
01:12:47,757 --> 01:12:49,520
let's race!

1245
01:12:50,026 --> 01:12:51,323
Across the bridge? Are you insane?

1246
01:12:52,095 --> 01:12:53,460
The bridge is too long

1247
01:12:53,596 --> 01:12:54,392
I'll die before I get to the other side

1248
01:12:54,831 --> 01:12:56,093
Will you join us?

1249
01:14:40,570 --> 01:14:41,696
Come and dance with me

1250
01:14:57,954 --> 01:14:59,114
I grew up in the orphanage

1251
01:14:59,689 --> 01:15:01,714
I come back when I have time

1252
01:15:04,127 --> 01:15:06,527
Why did you follow me?

1253
01:15:09,999 --> 01:15:11,694
I saw you crying at the kiosk,

1254
01:15:13,002 --> 01:15:15,095
I worried about you, so I followed you

1255
01:15:15,872 --> 01:15:16,896
So, you have followed me
for quite some time

1256
01:15:20,643 --> 01:15:23,510
What a shame!
You always see me when I'm crying

1257
01:15:26,583 --> 01:15:27,880
My fellows said you are cool,

1258
01:15:28,017 --> 01:15:29,075
and that you never cry

1259
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:32,087
Even Big Head hasn't seen me cry

1260
01:15:34,724 --> 01:15:35,486
How about last time?

1261
01:15:36,392 --> 01:15:37,086
Last time?

1262
01:15:39,262 --> 01:15:42,698
The nurse who took care of me
in the orphanage died

1263
01:15:45,502 --> 01:15:46,867
How about just now?

1264
01:15:52,075 --> 01:15:55,511
Can you play with me? To make me happy?

1265
01:15:57,380 --> 01:15:58,312
How?

1266
01:15:59,549 --> 01:16:01,244
Do you want me to do this?

1267
01:16:02,118 --> 01:16:02,948
Of course not!

1268
01:16:05,955 --> 01:16:06,944
Let's go and have fun!

1269
01:16:46,229 --> 01:16:47,628
What the hell are you doing?

1270
01:16:47,931 --> 01:16:49,762
Your machine is out of order

1271
01:16:49,799 --> 01:16:50,731
No tickets in this machine!

1272
01:16:50,867 --> 01:16:51,799
Please check it out

1273
01:16:51,834 --> 01:16:53,028
Let me check

1274
01:16:58,474 --> 01:16:59,406
You are good with that machine

1275
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:02,306
I come here to make myself happy
whenever I feel sad

1276
01:17:02,946 --> 01:17:04,277
Do you know there's some magic?

1277
01:17:05,315 --> 01:17:07,010
For the greedy people,

1278
01:17:07,150 --> 01:17:09,380
they will move those coins in the middle

1279
01:17:09,719 --> 01:17:11,050
But,

1280
01:17:11,220 --> 01:17:13,780
they are not movable
because it's too heavy

1281
01:17:14,524 --> 01:17:17,550
But if you push the coins at the side,
it's not that heavy,

1282
01:17:17,894 --> 01:17:19,327
and they will be easily moved

1283
01:17:21,798 --> 01:17:23,060
Do you always come here with Big Head?

1284
01:17:24,334 --> 01:17:25,130
No

1285
01:17:26,569 --> 01:17:28,662
He said these are childish games
He hates this place

1286
01:17:32,742 --> 01:17:34,209
You scared me with your hair

1287
01:17:34,344 --> 01:17:35,140
when I last saw you at the nightclub

1288
01:17:35,545 --> 01:17:36,375
It's not your style

1289
01:17:38,681 --> 01:17:39,773
Do you know me?

1290
01:17:43,019 --> 01:17:43,849
That's true

1291
01:17:46,422 --> 01:17:48,185
I don't even know myself

1292
01:17:50,526 --> 01:17:51,686
What's your birthday?

1293
01:17:53,529 --> 01:17:54,393
April fourth

1294
01:17:55,632 --> 01:17:58,863
Children's Day. Your sign is the Ram

1295
01:17:59,836 --> 01:18:01,827
You'll have a chance to be a boss

1296
01:18:03,206 --> 01:18:04,036
You believe in this?

1297
01:18:08,044 --> 01:18:09,306
And your birthday?

1298
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:13,274
February 14th

1299
01:18:13,883 --> 01:18:15,874
Valentine's Day. My sign is Aquarius

1300
01:18:16,686 --> 01:18:18,313
Are all Aquarius girls like you?

1301
01:18:18,955 --> 01:18:20,013
Yes

1302
01:18:20,823 --> 01:18:23,951
I love to fantasize and
I'm always deep in thoughts

1303
01:18:25,094 --> 01:18:28,120
My name is Fei. F-E-I

1304
01:18:28,831 --> 01:18:30,992
Actually, I want to name myself Fly

1305
01:18:32,068 --> 01:18:34,002
I feel like a bird

1306
01:18:34,837 --> 01:18:38,364
I can fly as high as I want,
as far as I wish

1307
01:18:39,509 --> 01:18:41,807
If one day I fly away,

1308
01:18:42,879 --> 01:18:44,312
I may not come back

1309
01:18:52,655 --> 01:18:57,217
You know,
I am used to ditching my boyfriends

1310
01:18:59,595 --> 01:19:01,654
That's why
I'm thinking of ditching Big Head

1311
01:19:07,670 --> 01:19:08,602
Are you flirting with me?

1312
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:12,007
Stop dreaming

1313
01:19:12,141 --> 01:19:15,372
Who do you think you are?
You're too young!

1314
01:19:16,512 --> 01:19:19,970
Think of it! Time to eat, little boy!

1315
01:19:20,116 --> 01:19:22,141
Time to eat, boy! Hurry up!

1316
01:19:27,957 --> 01:19:29,447
Don't touch my hair!

1317
01:19:29,792 --> 01:19:30,383
I don't know you very well

1318
01:19:33,963 --> 01:19:34,952
What's wrong with your face?

1319
01:19:35,331 --> 01:19:36,127
I was beaten

1320
01:19:37,166 --> 01:19:38,030
By Big Head

1321
01:19:40,069 --> 01:19:41,730
I quarrelled with him on the phone

1322
01:19:43,272 --> 01:19:43,897
No matter what,

1323
01:19:45,341 --> 01:19:47,002
a man should never beat a woman

1324
01:19:53,149 --> 01:19:54,241
Does it hurt?

1325
01:20:06,529 --> 01:20:07,826
Do you dare to kiss me?

1326
01:20:13,669 --> 01:20:16,763
Do you dare to kiss me right here?

1327
01:20:20,042 --> 01:20:20,940
Are you challenging me?

1328
01:20:43,966 --> 01:20:44,557
You said I am too young

1329
01:20:45,067 --> 01:20:45,624
Why kiss me?

1330
01:20:47,837 --> 01:20:48,963
You said I am too young

1331
01:20:49,472 --> 01:20:50,666
I'm just kissing you,
it doesn't mean anything

1332
01:20:55,411 --> 01:20:56,343
Why are you blushing?

1333
01:20:57,180 --> 01:20:57,942
Am I blushing?

1334
01:21:25,174 --> 01:21:26,038
I want to see Fei

1335
01:21:27,276 --> 01:21:28,265
Do you know where she is?

1336
01:21:30,346 --> 01:21:31,335
I can't find her either

1337
01:21:31,848 --> 01:21:33,076
Who did you just call

1338
01:21:34,317 --> 01:21:35,579
I called her, but...

1339
01:21:35,785 --> 01:21:36,615
No one answered

1340
01:21:37,453 --> 01:21:38,681
Did you come out from her home
this morning?

1341
01:21:42,124 --> 01:21:42,818
Yes, so what?

1342
01:21:43,659 --> 01:21:44,523
You want to court my girl?

1343
01:21:47,563 --> 01:21:49,292
If you consider her your girlfriend,
you wouldn't have beaten her

1344
01:21:49,765 --> 01:21:50,561
Did you screw her?

1345
01:21:57,406 --> 01:21:57,997
None of your business

1346
01:21:58,274 --> 01:21:59,036
Bastard!

1347
01:22:02,845 --> 01:22:04,210
You practise boxing
in order to punch your girl?

1348
01:22:04,714 --> 01:22:05,976
Alright, let's fight

1349
01:22:15,858 --> 01:22:17,849
If I win, return Fei to me

1350
01:22:22,298 --> 01:22:23,993
Fei is a girl, not a present

1351
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:25,924
She can choose her own lover

1352
01:22:27,136 --> 01:22:28,398
You don't even know
how to flatter a girl

1353
01:22:28,537 --> 01:22:29,526
How can you be her boyfriend?

1354
01:22:30,706 --> 01:22:31,331
Have you seen Fei smile?

1355
01:22:32,041 --> 01:22:33,030
Have you made her feel happy?

1356
01:22:34,810 --> 01:22:35,469
Answer me

1357
01:23:02,138 --> 01:23:03,070
Time's up

1358
01:23:03,906 --> 01:23:04,873
You work so hard

1359
01:23:05,274 --> 01:23:06,571
You two are so serious!

1360
01:23:07,076 --> 01:23:08,065
Woo, your nose is bleeding

1361
01:23:09,111 --> 01:23:10,703
I don't care what's going on
between the two of you

1362
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:12,069
It's finished now

1363
01:23:13,683 --> 01:23:14,650
Ho Nam, you've got enough rest

1364
01:23:15,484 --> 01:23:17,349
Tomorrow, you and Big Head
will lead a team each,

1365
01:23:17,753 --> 01:23:20,278
to negotiate with Tung Sing boys
at a construction site in Junk Bay

1366
01:23:20,623 --> 01:23:21,487
Kwan will be there too

1367
01:23:23,626 --> 01:23:24,456
I lead a team?

1368
01:23:24,860 --> 01:23:26,384
Yes, Big Head and
you will be the leaders

1369
01:23:27,063 --> 01:23:28,530
Call all the buddies back
to sleep here tonight

1370
01:23:29,265 --> 01:23:30,289
Don't work alone

1371
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:31,998
Big Head, any problem?

1372
01:23:32,835 --> 01:23:33,358
No problem!

1373
01:24:11,107 --> 01:24:11,869
You are right

1374
01:24:12,975 --> 01:24:14,442
I haven't seen Fei smile

1375
01:24:15,511 --> 01:24:17,240
And I haven't cared about her feelings

1376
01:24:18,347 --> 01:24:19,109
I am glad you understand at last

1377
01:24:49,045 --> 01:24:49,875
So many calls this early?

1378
01:24:50,646 --> 01:24:51,510
My mom is in the hospital

1379
01:24:52,415 --> 01:24:53,040
Is she okay?

1380
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,290
Boss...

1381
01:25:12,935 --> 01:25:14,459
Kwan and his fellows
will wear white gloves

1382
01:25:14,670 --> 01:25:15,602
You should wear white gloves too

1383
01:25:16,105 --> 01:25:17,037
Don't kill your buddies by mistake

1384
01:25:18,641 --> 01:25:19,369
Get your weapons

1385
01:25:42,665 --> 01:25:44,428
Boss, Kwan and his fellows
are not showing up

1386
01:25:46,102 --> 01:25:47,797
We have a date at the opposite site

1387
01:25:48,938 --> 01:25:49,870
We Hung Hing Boys
are famous for fighting

1388
01:25:50,139 --> 01:25:51,902
We'll be fine even if we're outnumbered

1389
01:25:58,948 --> 01:26:00,643
Bee is in trouble this time

1390
01:26:01,250 --> 01:26:03,411
I told him that I'd offer him 60 people,
he has to gather another 40

1391
01:26:03,786 --> 01:26:06,414
When my guys don't show up,
he'll be in deep shit

1392
01:26:08,757 --> 01:26:10,782
Piggy will lead a hundred people there

1393
01:26:10,926 --> 01:26:13,156
They will definitely win

1394
01:26:14,296 --> 01:26:15,627
Sha-man, you are so nice...

1395
01:26:15,965 --> 01:26:18,456
to give Piggy a chance to do something!

1396
01:26:18,667 --> 01:26:20,726
He was your fellow!

1397
01:26:20,970 --> 01:26:22,096
Of course I will take care of him

1398
01:26:22,505 --> 01:26:24,200
Shit! He may be killed or
become your scapegoat

1399
01:26:25,407 --> 01:26:26,931
Let's see whether he is lucky or not!

1400
01:26:28,177 --> 01:26:31,613
You said

1401
01:26:31,747 --> 01:26:33,374
you are great

1402
01:26:33,782 --> 01:26:35,272
So what's going on?

1403
01:26:35,651 --> 01:26:36,879
Are you sleepy?

1404
01:26:37,086 --> 01:26:38,110
I want a change

1405
01:26:38,287 --> 01:26:39,549
Alright, change someone else...

1406
01:26:40,656 --> 01:26:41,384
How about this one?

1407
01:26:42,291 --> 01:26:45,260
Kwan, since you are my buddy,

1408
01:26:45,694 --> 01:26:46,786
we can share the same girl, right?

1409
01:26:47,062 --> 01:26:48,461
This one is nice!
She did a good job for me

1410
01:26:49,665 --> 01:26:52,225
Hey, wait a second,

1411
01:26:52,368 --> 01:26:53,232
I would like you
to clean your mouth first

1412
01:26:53,502 --> 01:26:55,333
I don't know
whether I should trust this guy

1413
01:27:03,913 --> 01:27:05,107
Kwan and his fellows are coming

1414
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:13,654
I know Kwan won't ditch me!

1415
01:27:20,496 --> 01:27:21,485
Come on, kill them!

1416
01:27:21,931 --> 01:27:22,920
Kill them!

1417
01:27:23,265 --> 01:27:24,197
Damn it! They are from Tung Sing Group!

1418
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:25,159
Boss, you'd better leave first!

1419
01:27:25,301 --> 01:27:26,063
Kwan trapped us! Let's run!

1420
01:29:59,254 --> 01:29:59,845
Don't let them go!

1421
01:30:00,055 --> 01:30:01,989
Stop! Stay where you are!

1422
01:30:02,224 --> 01:30:02,588
Let me kill him!

1423
01:30:18,774 --> 01:30:20,366
Nam, where else can you go?

1424
01:30:28,617 --> 01:30:29,811
We must co-operate now

1425
01:30:31,353 --> 01:30:32,047
Damn it!

1426
01:30:33,889 --> 01:30:34,446
Bastard!

1427
01:30:38,093 --> 01:30:38,923
Run, Big Head, run!

1428
01:30:39,528 --> 01:30:40,222
Stay where you are! Bastard!

1429
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:05,550
Cops are coming, run!

1430
01:31:16,398 --> 01:31:21,199
Help...

1431
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:26,036
Help me!

1432
01:31:29,678 --> 01:31:30,906
Help!

1433
01:31:32,314 --> 01:31:33,542
Anybody help me?

1434
01:31:35,217 --> 01:31:36,309
Help!

1435
01:31:42,491 --> 01:31:43,890
Gang fight victims. Serve them right

1436
01:31:44,092 --> 01:31:45,389
Cut the trap, save them first!

1437
01:31:47,596 --> 01:31:49,029
Since 10 pm last night,

1438
01:31:49,164 --> 01:31:50,927
the Chinese soldiers started
to shoot at...

1439
01:31:51,099 --> 01:31:53,567
the people and students
who stopped them...

1440
01:31:53,702 --> 01:31:54,566
from moving into town,

1441
01:31:54,903 --> 01:31:55,301
until now,

1442
01:31:55,437 --> 01:31:58,702
over 2,600 people were shot dead

1443
01:31:59,475 --> 01:32:01,773
This is the first time...

1444
01:32:01,977 --> 01:32:03,137
the Communist Government...

1445
01:32:05,013 --> 01:32:05,775
Where is Chan Suk-fong?

1446
01:32:06,782 --> 01:32:08,477
Slow down!
Why was she sent to the hospital?

1447
01:32:09,585 --> 01:32:11,553
I don't know, which room is she in?

1448
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:19,923
Which room?

1449
01:32:20,596 --> 01:32:23,360
Look I'm checking!
You are as fierce as the communists!

1450
01:32:25,801 --> 01:32:27,769
Around 10 last night,

1451
01:32:27,903 --> 01:32:29,268
the troops started to...

1452
01:32:29,505 --> 01:32:32,633
move into town for a bloody suppression

1453
01:32:45,387 --> 01:32:47,685
Nurse, is that Chan Suk-fong?

1454
01:32:48,023 --> 01:32:49,490
There is a name plate,
you can read it yourself

1455
01:32:53,862 --> 01:32:54,851
Mom...

1456
01:32:55,597 --> 01:32:57,189
Please don't die! Mom...

1457
01:32:58,033 --> 01:32:59,523
Let me see my mom! Please

1458
01:33:00,035 --> 01:33:01,400
I am sorry,
this should be sent to the mortuary

1459
01:33:01,670 --> 01:33:03,001
I don't care, I want to see my mom...

1460
01:33:03,805 --> 01:33:05,796
Mom, don't stop me!

1461
01:33:07,843 --> 01:33:09,310
Mom, don't go...

1462
01:33:16,318 --> 01:33:20,618
Mom, don't leave me!

1463
01:33:25,694 --> 01:33:26,626
Just like you...

1464
01:33:28,830 --> 01:33:30,695
I couldn't see her one last time
before she died

1465
01:33:32,935 --> 01:33:35,301
When she died this morning,

1466
01:33:37,606 --> 01:33:38,971
you were killing others

1467
01:33:39,608 --> 01:33:40,438
Mom...

1468
01:33:40,576 --> 01:33:45,070
I got an order to clean up
the mess you people made,

1469
01:33:46,281 --> 01:33:47,111
so I...

1470
01:33:48,750 --> 01:33:49,944
I couldn't come to the hospital

1471
01:33:52,454 --> 01:33:57,448
I was so afraid that...

1472
01:33:58,860 --> 01:34:02,261
I would carrying you to my ambulance...

1473
01:34:07,269 --> 01:34:09,032
Last night, many people died

1474
01:34:09,838 --> 01:34:14,502
So many people...

1475
01:34:14,776 --> 01:34:16,175
watching people die on TV...

1476
01:34:17,279 --> 01:34:19,179
I don't care how they died at Tiananmen

1477
01:34:19,848 --> 01:34:21,509
I just want to know how my mom died

1478
01:34:23,085 --> 01:34:24,814
Tell me!

1479
01:34:26,822 --> 01:34:27,584
I am tired

1480
01:34:29,391 --> 01:34:33,828
I have to go back
to take care of Sis and Dee

1481
01:34:37,666 --> 01:34:41,329
Call me tomorrow,

1482
01:34:42,270 --> 01:34:44,966
I want to discuss her funeral with you

1483
01:34:49,211 --> 01:34:50,200
Don't leave

1484
01:34:50,712 --> 01:34:52,304
Tell me how my mom died

1485
01:35:21,276 --> 01:35:22,402
Don't move! Do you want more punches?

1486
01:35:22,678 --> 01:35:23,269
I'll burst your head!

1487
01:35:29,384 --> 01:35:31,249
Boss, this is the money we got today,
check it please

1488
01:35:33,722 --> 01:35:34,484
Shut up!

1489
01:35:38,293 --> 01:35:39,157
Shut up! Don't move!

1490
01:35:43,165 --> 01:35:44,723
How are the girls?

1491
01:35:45,033 --> 01:35:46,591
They pray right after coming back

1492
01:35:46,735 --> 01:35:48,225
They are like nuns

1493
01:35:49,738 --> 01:35:51,365
Get more girls for me

1494
01:35:51,873 --> 01:35:52,669
Yes, boss

1495
01:35:52,908 --> 01:35:53,806
Keep it Yes

1496
01:35:57,679 --> 01:35:58,236
What are you looking at?

1497
01:35:58,613 --> 01:35:59,773
Stop staring! What do you want?

1498
01:36:04,019 --> 01:36:04,678
What do you want?

1499
01:36:05,087 --> 01:36:05,849
Pick him up

1500
01:36:08,156 --> 01:36:08,747
Still trying to be cool?

1501
01:36:09,858 --> 01:36:10,722
Do you know who I am?

1502
01:36:11,927 --> 01:36:13,121
I am Sha-man of Tung Sing Group!

1503
01:36:20,669 --> 01:36:21,897
Do you know who he is?

1504
01:36:25,407 --> 01:36:26,533
He is my real brother

1505
01:36:31,446 --> 01:36:32,572
You were lucky...

1506
01:36:32,714 --> 01:36:34,011
to escape this morning

1507
01:36:35,250 --> 01:36:36,376
But now, you are with me

1508
01:36:37,519 --> 01:36:39,384
God won't help you this time

1509
01:36:41,523 --> 01:36:42,455
Dare you fight with me?

1510
01:36:42,591 --> 01:36:43,387
You want a counter attack?

1511
01:36:44,459 --> 01:36:45,255
How dare you!

1512
01:36:45,660 --> 01:36:47,184
How dare you counter attack?

1513
01:36:51,199 --> 01:36:52,188
Damn you! Open his mouth for me

1514
01:36:59,508 --> 01:37:00,338
Bastard!

1515
01:37:00,542 --> 01:37:01,065
Hang him up!

1516
01:37:14,523 --> 01:37:15,751
You dared to kill my brother

1517
01:37:16,625 --> 01:37:18,593
You should be prepared to be avenged

1518
01:37:19,361 --> 01:37:21,886
But I won't let you die easily

1519
01:37:22,497 --> 01:37:23,691
I will let you have a good time tonight

1520
01:37:24,065 --> 01:37:24,588
Come on!

1521
01:37:27,369 --> 01:37:28,097
Do you know what it is?

1522
01:37:28,570 --> 01:37:29,935
I learned it from "Long Arm of the Law"

1523
01:37:33,508 --> 01:37:36,238
I'll cover your head and punch you!

1524
01:37:36,912 --> 01:37:38,106
You're gonna love this!

1525
01:37:39,281 --> 01:37:40,077
Show time

1526
01:37:42,684 --> 01:37:44,379
Yes, boss!

1527
01:37:45,787 --> 01:37:46,412
What the hell?

1528
01:37:46,655 --> 01:37:47,781
Your boss is on the line

1529
01:37:49,925 --> 01:37:53,725
Chan Ho Nam? Yes

1530
01:37:57,165 --> 01:37:59,531
Alright, you're the boss

1531
01:38:03,572 --> 01:38:04,971
Do your best!

1532
01:38:09,110 --> 01:38:09,804
Burst his head!

1533
01:38:10,345 --> 01:38:11,573
You handicapped bastards! Let me do it!

1534
01:38:18,987 --> 01:38:19,646
Hold his leg

1535
01:38:21,456 --> 01:38:22,115
Do you want to play with me?

1536
01:38:27,495 --> 01:38:28,519
I'll treat you to a rat

1537
01:38:39,941 --> 01:38:40,635
To hell with you!

1538
01:38:42,777 --> 01:38:44,745
Have you watched TV?

1539
01:38:44,980 --> 01:38:47,107
So many people died at Tiananmen

1540
01:38:47,849 --> 01:38:49,146
You didn't watch the news, did you?

1541
01:38:49,718 --> 01:38:50,685
Did you hear what Yuen Mu say?

1542
01:38:50,819 --> 01:38:53,049
No one died

1543
01:38:57,359 --> 01:38:58,656
That guy must be a rascal like us!

1544
01:38:59,728 --> 01:39:00,490
Hey,

1545
01:39:00,662 --> 01:39:02,391
you look like Yuen

1546
01:39:02,864 --> 01:39:05,492
You are flattering me!
I look smarter, right?

1547
01:39:06,701 --> 01:39:09,067
Bee, do you want to join us?

1548
01:39:09,237 --> 01:39:12,695
Sit down,
you are winning and you want to leave?

1549
01:39:13,675 --> 01:39:15,199
I didn't win much!

1550
01:39:15,510 --> 01:39:16,442
But I lost a lot

1551
01:39:16,645 --> 01:39:17,509
Go on

1552
01:39:18,346 --> 01:39:20,371
You know I seldom beg for other's help

1553
01:39:20,882 --> 01:39:21,348
Bee,

1554
01:39:21,483 --> 01:39:23,212
we are buddies, just say it

1555
01:39:23,585 --> 01:39:25,177
I have looked
for Mr. Chiang and Chan Yiu,

1556
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:26,509
they are not in Hong Kong

1557
01:39:26,655 --> 01:39:28,816
That's why I would like you...

1558
01:39:28,957 --> 01:39:29,855
to give me some advice

1559
01:39:30,191 --> 01:39:30,850
I've been informed

1560
01:39:31,660 --> 01:39:34,151
You and Kwan were supposed
to fight with Tung Sing Group

1561
01:39:34,763 --> 01:39:35,525
Don't mention Kwan. That bastard!

1562
01:39:35,664 --> 01:39:37,097
People said he is a scum,

1563
01:39:37,399 --> 01:39:38,161
I didn't believe it

1564
01:39:38,366 --> 01:39:39,958
But now he has proved it

1565
01:39:40,635 --> 01:39:42,796
It doesn't matter, he trapped you once,

1566
01:39:42,971 --> 01:39:45,098
you can make him pay for it

1567
01:39:46,074 --> 01:39:47,803
But my boy is caught
by the Tung Sing boys

1568
01:39:47,943 --> 01:39:49,774
Camel wants a negotiation

1569
01:39:49,911 --> 01:39:51,503
I hope you would help me

1570
01:39:52,113 --> 01:39:52,772
Bee,

1571
01:39:53,248 --> 01:39:56,740
just a kid of yours,

1572
01:39:56,952 --> 01:39:59,785
you can easily get a dozen

1573
01:40:00,655 --> 01:40:02,179
Is your boy good at fighting?

1574
01:40:02,791 --> 01:40:06,454
If he was, he wouldn't have been caught

1575
01:40:08,129 --> 01:40:09,790
All my boys are important to me

1576
01:40:10,732 --> 01:40:12,757
Well, it's quite difficult for us

1577
01:40:13,234 --> 01:40:16,067
You did that for personal interest,
now you seek help from us

1578
01:40:16,404 --> 01:40:18,895
We are not supposed to be involved,
right?

1579
01:40:19,140 --> 01:40:20,004
Seven, you're the banker

1580
01:40:21,009 --> 01:40:22,442
I've lost a lot,

1581
01:40:22,711 --> 01:40:23,905
the game should go on

1582
01:40:24,846 --> 01:40:27,144
Bee, let's wait until we finish the game

1583
01:40:27,282 --> 01:40:29,045
then we'll discuss the matter with you,
OK?

1584
01:40:29,551 --> 01:40:32,019
Alright, excuse me

1585
01:40:32,287 --> 01:40:32,810
Let's go!

1586
01:40:38,426 --> 01:40:40,189
Once you're under me,
I'll treat you like my sons

1587
01:40:40,695 --> 01:40:43,562
Ho Nam is now in trouble,
are you going with me?

1588
01:40:44,099 --> 01:40:44,963
You should make up your own mind

1589
01:40:59,047 --> 01:41:00,878
If you are afraid and want to stay back,
I won't blame you

1590
01:41:01,549 --> 01:41:03,710
Boss, we are buddies of Nam

1591
01:41:04,185 --> 01:41:05,015
I'm definitely going with you

1592
01:41:30,845 --> 01:41:32,210
Stand right there!

1593
01:41:34,983 --> 01:41:35,813
Bee

1594
01:41:36,985 --> 01:41:38,612
Your boss Camel is waiting for me

1595
01:41:39,320 --> 01:41:40,810
Many people are waiting for you

1596
01:41:41,856 --> 01:41:43,721
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

1597
01:41:44,426 --> 01:41:45,324
The brave Six!

1598
01:41:46,027 --> 01:41:47,051
Boss said,

1599
01:41:47,695 --> 01:41:49,993
you can only bring two kids with you,
finished

1600
01:41:50,498 --> 01:41:51,795
Why are you...

1601
01:41:52,033 --> 01:41:53,398
afraid of me and my boys?

1602
01:41:53,768 --> 01:41:54,860
No one gives a damn!

1603
01:41:55,170 --> 01:41:57,138
But you're on our turf
so you're definitely outnumbered

1604
01:41:57,672 --> 01:41:59,264
We'll let you bring two kids with you,

1605
01:41:59,407 --> 01:42:01,136
since we want others to know
what has happened

1606
01:42:02,777 --> 01:42:03,539
Well, the three of you stay behind

1607
01:42:03,778 --> 01:42:04,870
Chicken, Po, follow me

1608
01:42:06,948 --> 01:42:07,812
Wait

1609
01:42:08,483 --> 01:42:10,508
Bee, I am sorry. Just a routine check

1610
01:42:25,133 --> 01:42:25,997
Boss, nothing is found!

1611
01:42:27,402 --> 01:42:29,267
Good! Boss Bee

1612
01:42:29,604 --> 01:42:30,662
You are really tough

1613
01:43:04,772 --> 01:43:06,672
Boss,

1614
01:43:06,808 --> 01:43:08,867
why do you call for this meeting?

1615
01:43:09,077 --> 01:43:10,271
Why are all the branch leaders
asked to attend?

1616
01:43:11,613 --> 01:43:13,513
Sha-man's real brother died

1617
01:43:14,182 --> 01:43:16,514
He kidnapped Bee's kid...

1618
01:43:16,651 --> 01:43:17,948
for a negotiation

1619
01:43:18,586 --> 01:43:19,985
Sha-man is the smartest fellow of us,

1620
01:43:21,189 --> 01:43:22,656
we should give him some face

1621
01:43:22,790 --> 01:43:25,588
Boss, he is a trouble maker

1622
01:43:26,127 --> 01:43:27,389
Don't you worry that he is using us?

1623
01:43:27,896 --> 01:43:30,694
If there's something in it for us,
we'll help

1624
01:43:30,932 --> 01:43:33,059
That's correct

1625
01:43:37,839 --> 01:43:38,669
Boss

1626
01:43:40,542 --> 01:43:43,443
Woo, so many VIPs are waiting

1627
01:43:43,745 --> 01:43:44,837
I am so proud

1628
01:43:46,181 --> 01:43:46,875
Bee,

1629
01:43:47,482 --> 01:43:49,575
we are not fighting against the Japanese

1630
01:43:50,418 --> 01:43:51,851
we are friends, aren't we?

1631
01:43:52,287 --> 01:43:55,154
Serve them tea now!

1632
01:43:55,490 --> 01:43:56,479
You should be smart

1633
01:43:58,760 --> 01:44:01,627
The leaders of our group...

1634
01:44:01,763 --> 01:44:03,128
are all here

1635
01:44:04,032 --> 01:44:05,397
You want to save the kid

1636
01:44:05,967 --> 01:44:07,662
And you promised to pay anything we want

1637
01:44:08,002 --> 01:44:09,560
Well, the boss is listening

1638
01:44:10,238 --> 01:44:11,000
Go ahead

1639
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:14,034
What's the name of the kid?

1640
01:44:15,843 --> 01:44:16,741
Chan Ho Nam

1641
01:44:17,212 --> 01:44:17,906
Where is he?

1642
01:44:19,314 --> 01:44:20,076
Take him out!

1643
01:44:29,891 --> 01:44:31,882
Bastard! Are you beasts?

1644
01:44:32,660 --> 01:44:34,287
Nam!

1645
01:44:34,862 --> 01:44:37,194
Chicken, behave yourself!

1646
01:44:43,671 --> 01:44:44,968
Boss...

1647
01:44:48,443 --> 01:44:50,604
Wow, do you have to treat
my boy like that?

1648
01:44:51,479 --> 01:44:52,707
He should thank me for not killing him!

1649
01:44:53,248 --> 01:44:54,772
He owes me my brother's life

1650
01:44:55,717 --> 01:44:59,346
Sha-man, what do you want?
Just tell him frankly

1651
01:45:00,888 --> 01:45:01,616
Alright

1652
01:45:02,690 --> 01:45:04,920
About the decoration business
of Tung Fung Garden,

1653
01:45:05,193 --> 01:45:06,854
Hung Hing boys should leave
everything to us

1654
01:45:07,262 --> 01:45:09,389
And, after the gang fight,

1655
01:45:09,530 --> 01:45:12,727
one of our boys died, 20 were injured,
30 were caught

1656
01:45:12,867 --> 01:45:15,768
You should pay me 3 million
for compensation,

1657
01:45:15,903 --> 01:45:16,665
OK?

1658
01:45:17,005 --> 01:45:19,166
And, Nam should be out of my sight,

1659
01:45:19,307 --> 01:45:20,797
never to come back again!

1660
01:45:22,076 --> 01:45:23,441
Do you have to be so tough!

1661
01:45:23,878 --> 01:45:26,039
Li Peng should have asked you
to negotiate with the students!

1662
01:45:26,514 --> 01:45:27,947
You can't put it that way

1663
01:45:28,383 --> 01:45:30,146
Your kid killed his brother

1664
01:45:30,585 --> 01:45:33,053
He should pay for it

1665
01:45:33,955 --> 01:45:36,446
You called me to keep him alive,

1666
01:45:36,591 --> 01:45:39,822
and,
Sha-man said you promised to compensate

1667
01:45:39,994 --> 01:45:41,018
So I called my fellows...

1668
01:45:41,162 --> 01:45:42,789
to meet you here!

1669
01:45:43,197 --> 01:45:44,129
What do you think?

1670
01:45:45,099 --> 01:45:46,532
Sha-man's loss...

1671
01:45:46,668 --> 01:45:48,295
is our loss

1672
01:45:48,870 --> 01:45:50,735
He should pay us 1
3 of what...

1673
01:45:50,872 --> 01:45:52,100
he will get

1674
01:45:55,710 --> 01:45:59,237
Sha-man, you gain much
from the decoration business

1675
01:46:00,081 --> 01:46:01,708
My buddies can't make a living...

1676
01:46:02,150 --> 01:46:03,378
in Tuen Mun,

1677
01:46:03,918 --> 01:46:05,510
why don't you leave some jobs to us?

1678
01:46:10,024 --> 01:46:10,922
Bee, what do you think?

1679
01:46:13,861 --> 01:46:16,295
I just want to know... if I don't promise

1680
01:46:16,464 --> 01:46:17,761
will you let me walk out of here?

1681
01:46:19,267 --> 01:46:20,529
Let's go to hell together!

1682
01:46:23,838 --> 01:46:26,033
You have the guts to come here,

1683
01:46:26,808 --> 01:46:28,105
if I harm you,

1684
01:46:28,609 --> 01:46:31,544
that'll only mean that I'm spiteful

1685
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:35,114
I don't have to worry then

1686
01:46:37,685 --> 01:46:40,586
Po, have you finished what I told you?

1687
01:46:40,888 --> 01:46:41,820
Yes, boss

1688
01:46:47,528 --> 01:46:49,519
Sha-man,

1689
01:46:49,831 --> 01:46:51,594
Bill and I shared
the decoration business

1690
01:46:52,767 --> 01:46:55,668
But he didn't stick to the rule,
he asked for it, you can blame no one

1691
01:46:56,471 --> 01:46:59,804
About the gang fight held yesterday,

1692
01:47:00,208 --> 01:47:01,675
it's a rascal's game! You know the rules

1693
01:47:01,809 --> 01:47:02,901
You ask for compensation?

1694
01:47:03,177 --> 01:47:05,907
Who will compensate my loss?

1695
01:47:06,914 --> 01:47:08,711
You're really smart though!

1696
01:47:08,983 --> 01:47:11,110
You allied with Kwan to trap me!

1697
01:47:11,352 --> 01:47:13,718
You prefer co-operating
with the betrayer of Hung Hing,

1698
01:47:14,922 --> 01:47:17,823
but not benefiting your own boys,
you are great!

1699
01:47:18,326 --> 01:47:19,315
What's that bull shit!

1700
01:47:21,262 --> 01:47:23,492
Bee, as you say

1701
01:47:24,265 --> 01:47:26,529
you don't want to pay a penny, right?

1702
01:47:27,135 --> 01:47:30,104
I didn't do anything wrong

1703
01:47:30,705 --> 01:47:33,640
I don't mind giving half
the decoration business to you

1704
01:47:34,008 --> 01:47:36,977
As his boss, I am obliged to protect him

1705
01:47:38,513 --> 01:47:39,104
Boss...

1706
01:47:40,782 --> 01:47:41,305
Boss!

1707
01:47:48,923 --> 01:47:51,892
Camel, this is for you guys

1708
01:47:55,029 --> 01:47:58,624
Camel, I hope you will let my boy go

1709
01:47:59,801 --> 01:48:00,790
Boss, you can't do that

1710
01:48:01,002 --> 01:48:01,661
Shut up!

1711
01:48:03,538 --> 01:48:06,507
Be generous this time,
you'll gain in the future

1712
01:48:06,641 --> 01:48:07,767
It's a lesson you should learn

1713
01:48:09,210 --> 01:48:10,199
Boss is right

1714
01:48:10,845 --> 01:48:12,938
Sha-man, this is your fault!

1715
01:48:15,550 --> 01:48:17,450
Take Ho Nam away

1716
01:48:18,019 --> 01:48:18,451
Yes!

1717
01:48:20,855 --> 01:48:23,483
Let's go, Nam! Get up!

1718
01:48:23,825 --> 01:48:24,257
Boss...

1719
01:48:24,559 --> 01:48:27,585
Camel, I asked my boy to kidnap
your grand-daughter

1720
01:48:29,897 --> 01:48:31,023
How dare you!

1721
01:48:31,866 --> 01:48:34,391
Don't worry, if I get out of here alive,

1722
01:48:35,102 --> 01:48:36,865
your grand-daughter will be very safe

1723
01:48:38,739 --> 01:48:39,967
Thank you, man!

1724
01:48:43,377 --> 01:48:44,605
Get up, let's go!

1725
01:48:44,946 --> 01:48:45,605
Come on!

1726
01:48:46,647 --> 01:48:50,413
It'll be alright, let's go home!

1727
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:53,048
Let's go home, Nam!

1728
01:48:53,488 --> 01:48:53,852
Come on!

1729
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:09,766
Life is like gambling

1730
01:49:10,605 --> 01:49:14,803
If you don't gamble,
how do you know you'll win!

1731
01:49:14,942 --> 01:49:16,239
Brother Kwan, what will you bet?

1732
01:49:16,644 --> 01:49:18,339
Banker, double!

1733
01:49:18,846 --> 01:49:19,437
Banker!

1734
01:49:19,814 --> 01:49:21,805
Brother Kwan, the banker has won
for 4 times consecutively

1735
01:49:22,183 --> 01:49:22,672
What?

1736
01:49:22,917 --> 01:49:24,942
I love to be a banker,
so I bet on the banker

1737
01:49:25,286 --> 01:49:26,150
Do you agree, honey!

1738
01:49:28,122 --> 01:49:28,952
I want to bet on player this time

1739
01:49:31,759 --> 01:49:33,283
Woo, thirty something!

1740
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:41,434
Move...

1741
01:49:42,837 --> 01:49:44,327
Brother Kwan, see, the player wins

1742
01:49:45,339 --> 01:49:46,306
What?

1743
01:49:46,807 --> 01:49:49,105
Can you see it? I've got nine!

1744
01:49:49,243 --> 01:49:50,210
Banker wins

1745
01:49:50,845 --> 01:49:51,641
What's wrong with it?

1746
01:49:51,779 --> 01:49:52,643
Banker wins!

1747
01:49:53,714 --> 01:49:55,705
Red Bull...

1748
01:49:56,183 --> 01:49:56,877
What's the matter, Brother Kwan?

1749
01:49:57,251 --> 01:49:58,240
Sha-man, what the hell is with him?

1750
01:49:58,586 --> 01:50:01,146
What time is it now?
Why do I have to wait?

1751
01:50:01,455 --> 01:50:02,683
Is he screwing up there?

1752
01:50:03,424 --> 01:50:05,016
He has to check the books,
he will come soon

1753
01:50:05,326 --> 01:50:07,123
Damn it! Ask him to get
his ass down here right now!

1754
01:50:07,929 --> 01:50:09,089
Fast!

1755
01:50:11,232 --> 01:50:13,200
Honey, you bring me good luck!

1756
01:50:13,534 --> 01:50:15,297
Come on, this is for you

1757
01:50:16,904 --> 01:50:17,563
You are so bad!

1758
01:50:17,705 --> 01:50:18,262
Come on!

1759
01:50:18,472 --> 01:50:19,461
Man, this is for you

1760
01:50:19,774 --> 01:50:20,297
Thank you, brother Kwan

1761
01:50:20,808 --> 01:50:22,105
Cop's raid! Hands up!

1762
01:50:22,777 --> 01:50:24,472
Don't move! Don't move...

1763
01:50:25,413 --> 01:50:26,937
Squat...

1764
01:50:31,986 --> 01:50:33,010
Red Bull, you said this turf is safe,
didn't you?

1765
01:50:33,154 --> 01:50:33,643
Why are the police here?

1766
01:50:33,788 --> 01:50:34,812
Brother Kwan, I don't know anything!

1767
01:50:35,489 --> 01:50:36,285
Show me your I.D. card

1768
01:50:37,258 --> 01:50:38,452
Kwan, you are in trouble

1769
01:50:38,593 --> 01:50:40,322
My boss had a good talk with Camel

1770
01:50:40,528 --> 01:50:42,018
He told us to do something here

1771
01:50:42,530 --> 01:50:43,792
What the hell is it?

1772
01:50:44,131 --> 01:50:45,860
It's just an illegal gambling turf,

1773
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:47,194
no big deal

1774
01:50:48,202 --> 01:50:48,793
You're very cocky

1775
01:50:48,936 --> 01:50:49,334
What's it?

1776
01:50:49,470 --> 01:50:50,061
Sir

1777
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:54,135
What's the relationship
between you and this girl?

1778
01:50:54,508 --> 01:50:55,998
Sir, she is my mom!

1779
01:50:56,677 --> 01:50:58,736
She feeds me milk...
She is my girl, so what?

1780
01:50:59,847 --> 01:51:01,542
She is underaged

1781
01:51:01,816 --> 01:51:02,976
We can charge you...

1782
01:51:03,117 --> 01:51:04,516
with having illegal sex
with an underaged girl

1783
01:51:04,652 --> 01:51:07,052
Madam, are you blind?

1784
01:51:07,288 --> 01:51:10,189
Look at her measurements, 36, 24, 36

1785
01:51:10,424 --> 01:51:11,891
She is so mature!

1786
01:51:12,093 --> 01:51:14,391
By the way,
you don't seem to be that mature, madam!

1787
01:51:15,096 --> 01:51:17,223
Brother Kwan, I'll be 16 next month

1788
01:51:20,034 --> 01:51:20,966
Go, Mr. Kwan!

1789
01:51:21,168 --> 01:51:21,896
And your girl

1790
01:51:22,136 --> 01:51:23,398
One after another

1791
01:51:23,537 --> 01:51:24,333
I don't know her very well,

1792
01:51:24,639 --> 01:51:26,539
she just sticks around...

1793
01:51:51,666 --> 01:51:54,999
The tattoo will follow you forever,
no regrets, huh?

1794
01:51:58,039 --> 01:51:58,733
Do it

1795
01:52:48,289 --> 01:52:49,381
Stay calm

1796
01:52:49,557 --> 01:52:50,524
Relax...

1797
01:52:55,663 --> 01:52:56,630
Stay calm...

1798
01:52:56,764 --> 01:52:59,164
Relax... Relax

1799
01:53:08,743 --> 01:53:10,904
It'll be okay

1800
01:53:19,987 --> 01:53:23,889
It'll be quick! It won't hurt much

1801
01:53:24,658 --> 01:53:26,250
It'll be alright, stay calm

1802
01:53:27,094 --> 01:53:28,789
It'll be quick

1803
01:53:33,968 --> 01:53:37,426
It takes less than half an hour,
and it's finished

1804
01:53:37,972 --> 01:53:40,406
You'll feel more painful
if you are tense...
