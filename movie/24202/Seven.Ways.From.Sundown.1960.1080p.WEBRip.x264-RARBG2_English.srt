Oh, I'm sorry.

1004
01:23:11,558 --> 01:23:14,394
You still
could have killed her.

1005
01:23:14,427 --> 01:23:17,130
A man just can't do
the things you do.

1006
01:23:17,163 --> 01:23:20,300
Look, Seven, we can do things
that nobody's ever dreamed of.

1007
01:23:20,333 --> 01:23:23,169
Come on.
No.

1008
01:23:24,871 --> 01:23:27,340
You know as well as I do
that you can't stop me.

1009
01:23:28,541 --> 01:23:31,478
I'll do my best.
Why?

1010
01:23:31,511 --> 01:23:36,149
Because of Hennessey,
that girl, all the others.

1011
01:23:36,182 --> 01:23:39,052
It's not enough
just to be sorry, Flood.

1012
01:23:40,587 --> 01:23:43,590
For all I know,
the man who killed my brother
might have been sorry.

1013
01:23:43,623 --> 01:23:46,059
But it didn't help.

1014
01:23:47,627 --> 01:23:49,329
Yeah.

1015
01:23:50,597 --> 01:23:54,434
Well, so long, Seven.

1016
01:24:00,607 --> 01:24:03,576
I've got to
stop you, Jim.

1017
01:24:03,610 --> 01:24:05,278
Turn around.

1018
01:24:29,936 --> 01:24:33,173
When I first met you,
you were pretty clumsy.

1019
01:24:33,206 --> 01:24:34,507
You've been improving.

1020
01:24:37,210 --> 01:24:40,680
I never knew you
to be so slow.

1021
01:24:40,714 --> 01:24:43,283
I didn't expect you
to miss like that.

1022
01:24:45,418 --> 01:24:49,589
At the last minute there,
I remembered you owed me $86.

1023
01:24:51,391 --> 01:24:54,394
Couldn't stand to lose
that gambling debt.

1024
01:24:56,329 --> 01:24:57,530
Yeah.

1025
01:25:00,734 --> 01:25:02,502
